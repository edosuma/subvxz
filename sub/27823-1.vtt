Sam: <i> All right.
We're ready when you are.</i>

00:40.740 --> 00:42.510
Helen: <i> Should I cover
my hair?</i>

00:43.142 --> 00:44.582
Sam: <i> What do you think?</i>

00:44.611 --> 00:47.681
Sheila: <i> Ah,
it's not gonna make
a difference to them,</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:50.954
<i> and it'll probably just
alienate people over here.</i>

00:50.983 --> 00:53.353
( clears throat )
Now? You ready?

00:54.120 --> 00:56.090
( inhales )

00:57.323 --> 00:59.063
My name is Helen Sterling

00:59.091 --> 01:03.101
{\an1}and my son Andrew Sterling
is a journalist.

01:04.330 --> 01:06.300
I am not supposed to
be saying this to you

01:06.332 --> 01:08.232
but I have money for you.

01:08.267 --> 01:11.197
{\an1}I'm in the process
of transferring to you

01:11.237 --> 01:13.167
{\an1}everything I have
in the world.

01:13.873 --> 01:15.113
I'm begging you.

01:16.175 --> 01:17.335
Sheila: I'm sorry.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.807
{\an1}-Oh, no.
-Sheila: No, no, no,
you're fine.

01:21.046 --> 01:23.146
Just, just be yourself.

01:23.182 --> 01:25.652
Myself doesn't make videos.

01:25.685 --> 01:27.485
{\an1}Sam: You know what,
the eye line is off anyway.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.620
{\an1}-Let's pretend these are
right underneath you.
-( camera beeps )

01:58.184 --> 01:59.924
( wind blowing )

01:59.952 --> 02:02.122
( wind chimes tinkling )

03:36.282 --> 03:37.482
{\an1}( pager beeps )

03:43.756 --> 03:45.316
( telephone ringing )

03:45.357 --> 03:46.757
( indistinct chatter )

03:46.793 --> 03:49.003
( monitors beeping )

03:58.203 --> 03:59.743
{\an1}( indistinct announcement
over PA )

04:04.444 --> 04:06.414
{\an1}Helen: All right,
you'll feel some tickles now.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.917
A little cold.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.889
( answering machine beeps )

04:18.923 --> 04:22.804
<i> Hi, you've reached the
assistant special agent
in-charge Eric Walsh.</i>

04:22.828 --> 04:27.568
{\an1}<i>Please leave a message.
If it's an emergency,
please dial 0 for assistance.</i>

04:27.600 --> 04:29.440
Helen: <i> Agent Walsh,
this is Helen Sterling.</i>

04:29.469 --> 04:32.769
<i>I wanted to follow up because
I haven't heard from you in,</i>

04:32.805 --> 04:35.975
<i> I don't know, I guess,
it's been a week now.</i>

04:36.008 --> 04:38.278
{\an1}<i> Sorry, I missed your call.
My phone was charging.</i>

04:38.310 --> 04:39.950
<i> I have it with me now.</i>

04:39.979 --> 04:42.149
{\an1}<i> Could you call me back,
whenever? It doesn't
matter what time.</i>

04:42.181 --> 04:43.751
<i> It's Helen Sterling.</i>

04:43.782 --> 04:45.722
{\an1}<i> Um, it keeps
going to voicemail,</i>

04:45.751 --> 04:47.651
{\an1}<i> so I guess you're
out of the office today.</i>

04:47.687 --> 04:50.387
{\an1}<i> If you check this,
will you please let me know?</i>

04:50.423 --> 04:52.493
{\an1}<i> I tried dialing 0,
by the way,
but the operator</i>

04:52.525 --> 04:56.025
{\an1}<i> didn't know who
to transfer me to, so...</i>

04:56.062 --> 04:58.332
{\an1}<i> Okay, just,
will you call me back?</i>

05:02.535 --> 05:04.295
( indistinct chatter )

05:07.039 --> 05:09.169
( monitor beeping )

05:09.208 --> 05:11.338
Helen: Good evening, Millie!

05:12.078 --> 05:14.708
{\an1}I've got your antibiotic
for you.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.317
( whirring )

05:16.348 --> 05:17.918
( groans softly )

05:17.950 --> 05:19.320
{\an1}Here you go.

05:20.886 --> 05:22.356
{\an1}That's good.

05:25.157 --> 05:26.427
{\an3}Hey.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.459
{\an1}Can you finish up in here
and meet me outside, please?

05:28.827 --> 05:29.857
Mmm-hmm.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.463
What's up?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.367
{\an1}-You have a visitor.
-Me?

05:33.399 --> 05:35.799
Yeah, a young woman,
Sheila, I think.

05:36.201 --> 05:37.741
Sheila.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.410
You know it's not
a good time to have
personal visits, Helen.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.910
She's in 438.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.241
I'll see what she wants.

05:44.276 --> 05:46.446
{\an1}Make it quick.
You know we're
in the middle of an audit.

05:46.479 --> 05:47.679
Helen: <i> Right, boss.</i>

05:50.716 --> 05:53.986
( woman retches
and coughs )

05:54.019 --> 05:55.389
( toilet flushes )

05:56.455 --> 05:57.615
{\an1}Merry Christmas!

05:57.656 --> 05:59.626
You sounded terrible
in there!

05:59.658 --> 06:03.728
{\an1}Do not eat sushi
in Lebanon, trust me.

06:04.463 --> 06:05.933
How long has it been this way?

06:05.964 --> 06:09.304
{\an1}It started, like,
that last week I was there,

06:09.335 --> 06:11.765
so like, I don't know,
two weeks.

06:11.804 --> 06:14.514
And of course
you don't have
any kind of insurance?

06:14.540 --> 06:16.780
{\an1}Welcome to
the freelance economy.

06:16.809 --> 06:17.979
Yeah. Lie down.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.210
Okay.

06:19.244 --> 06:20.814
Andy and I could both
win Pulitzers

06:20.846 --> 06:24.446
{\an1}and still not make
enough money
to even have to file taxes.

06:24.483 --> 06:27.253
Well, I offered to pay
Andy's insurance.

06:27.286 --> 06:29.656
But oh, no.
He's too stubborn.

06:30.122 --> 06:31.822
Too short-sighted.

06:31.857 --> 06:35.327
{\an1}Well, I finally heard
back from my friend
at the Red Cross.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.430
{\an1}No luck there.

06:36.461 --> 06:38.131
But there is someone else.

06:38.164 --> 06:40.004
{\an1}Yeah, well, let's not talk
about this now, okay?

06:40.032 --> 06:41.602
Helen, I'm worried.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.804
{\an8}I feel like you
keeping this all quiet

06:43.836 --> 06:46.536
{\an8}is just making it
harder on you.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.142
It's kinda making it
harder on all of us.

06:50.075 --> 06:51.705
Sorry, I'll be right back.

06:51.743 --> 06:52.883
{\an1}( groans )

06:53.245 --> 06:54.545
{\an1}Oh, shit!

06:55.347 --> 06:57.417
{\an1}( retching )

06:59.852 --> 07:01.052
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:01.086 --> 07:02.756
( indistinct chatter )

07:06.358 --> 07:07.558
( beeps )

07:14.833 --> 07:16.103
( beeping )

07:16.835 --> 07:19.235
( siren wailing in distance )

07:19.272 --> 07:20.842
{\an1}Here, this is for you.

07:20.873 --> 07:24.613
Take these now, and then
two a day for ten days.

07:25.077 --> 07:26.907
{\an1}And next time,

07:26.946 --> 07:29.846
{\an1}if there is a next time,
don't just show up.

07:29.882 --> 07:30.822
Call me first.

07:30.849 --> 07:32.719
I'm not getting you
in trouble, am I?

07:34.053 --> 07:35.153
{\an1}I can handle it.

07:38.557 --> 07:40.057
So who was the person
that you were saying,

07:40.092 --> 07:42.132
{\an1}-not the Red Cross,
but somebody?
-Yeah.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.670
{\an1}I was finally able
to get the number
of Leo Spencer's mother.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.839
{\an1}She's not the easiest person
to talk to, but...

07:51.237 --> 07:52.597
Please call her.

07:52.638 --> 07:55.668
{\an1}I know they told you
that you can't tell anyone.

07:55.707 --> 07:57.177
But Charlotte can help.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.313
{\an1}I'll think about it.

07:59.345 --> 08:01.705
{\an1}Leo is part of that same club
that Andy and I are in.

08:01.747 --> 08:04.177
So we helped Charlotte
when Leo was in trouble.

08:04.216 --> 08:05.746
Andy never mentioned a club.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.045
It's a really amazing
group of people.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.657
{\an1}So everyone pools their
resources together online.

08:10.689 --> 08:13.059
So you know where's safe
to go, where to eat,

08:13.092 --> 08:15.132
contacts, translators,
stuff like that.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.060
It's called the Viper Club.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.626
( chuckles )

08:18.664 --> 08:19.974
{\an1}"The Viper Club"?

08:19.999 --> 08:21.429
Yeah, well...

08:21.466 --> 08:23.466
I didn't come up
with the name.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.642
{\an8}Can I just stay here
for like...

08:25.670 --> 08:27.470
-Ten minutes.
-Okay.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.606
( siren wailing in distance )

09:19.091 --> 09:20.131
Yeah!

09:20.159 --> 09:21.759
( players cheering )

09:24.129 --> 09:26.599
( players chanting )

09:51.523 --> 09:52.733
( sighs )

10:01.133 --> 10:02.973
{\an1}( monitors beeping )

10:06.939 --> 10:07.769
What's up?

10:07.806 --> 10:09.006
{\an1}Helen: Can you
cover for me?

10:09.041 --> 10:10.411
{\an1}I thought I could
power through,

10:10.442 --> 10:13.312
but I'm burnt out.
This is my third double
this week.

10:13.345 --> 10:14.605
Helen... ( sighs )

10:14.646 --> 10:15.946
{\an1}I know, I know, I know.

10:15.981 --> 10:18.381
{\an1}But I took Carmelyn's
because it was her birthday...

10:18.417 --> 10:19.747
Hmm.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.361
{\an1}-I'll cover for you.
-( whispers ) Thank you.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.803
-Can you please
get some rest?
-Yes.

10:43.375 --> 10:44.575
( car lock chirps )

10:44.610 --> 10:46.250
( bus engine starts )

10:47.946 --> 10:49.076
Wait!

11:02.127 --> 11:03.327
( sighs )

11:18.343 --> 11:20.113
Step on the yellow line.

11:24.816 --> 11:26.286
( mouse clicking )

11:31.290 --> 11:32.890
( man speaking indistinctly )

11:37.762 --> 11:41.272
Agent Walsh: <i> What brings you
all the way down to the city,
Miss Sterling?</i>

11:41.299 --> 11:43.239
They sent me an e-mail.

11:43.268 --> 11:46.968
Fantastic, they finally
wrote to you directly.

11:47.005 --> 11:49.035
{\an1}We have to pass this along
to our Intelligence Analysts...

11:49.074 --> 11:50.984
But we'll respond to it today.

11:51.009 --> 11:52.239
I understand
your sense of urgency,

11:52.278 --> 11:53.778
{\an1}but this is not
going to happen today.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.713
No, it's going to
happen today.

11:55.747 --> 11:57.377
I mean, my...

11:57.916 --> 11:59.046
They reached out,

11:59.084 --> 12:00.524
that means
my son's still alive.

12:00.552 --> 12:03.622
It's not up to me.
There's a protocol
we have to follow.

12:03.655 --> 12:05.785
An internal report
has to be generated.

12:05.824 --> 12:07.134
What does that mean?

12:07.392 --> 12:08.232
Helen,

12:08.260 --> 12:10.560
{\an1}there are
a lot of people involved.

12:10.596 --> 12:12.656
And of course,
we need access

12:12.698 --> 12:14.498
{\an1}-to your e-mail accounts...
-Oh, sure.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.573
{\an1}So we can see
where the e-mail
might have been sent from.

12:17.603 --> 12:20.073
{\an1}Okay. And, um, I took off
from work today

12:20.105 --> 12:23.035
so I can help you
with this.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.035
{\an1}I'm sorry.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.436
{\an1}Nobody asked you
to do that.

12:26.311 --> 12:27.951
Nobody "asked" me?

12:28.813 --> 12:30.923
Nobody asked me...

12:30.949 --> 12:32.749
{\an1}-This is my child.
-I know this is upsetting,

12:32.784 --> 12:34.854
{\an1}but we don't know
who we're dealing with yet.

12:34.887 --> 12:35.987
{\an1}Even the State Department

12:36.021 --> 12:37.791
is struggling
to get information,

12:37.823 --> 12:39.493
{\an1}and they already have
people over there.

12:39.525 --> 12:40.655
This is a delicate process.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.133
We don't have time
for delicate.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.060
We're going to get Andy
home, Helen.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.896
{\an1}You just have to trust
the process.

12:45.931 --> 12:49.171
I'm not leaving here
until we respond.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.339
Let me see what's possible.

12:59.811 --> 13:02.251
( indistinct chatter )

13:07.686 --> 13:09.786
{\an1}( inaudible )

13:18.163 --> 13:20.503
{\an1}Agent Walsh:
Can I have a water, please?

13:29.842 --> 13:32.012
{\an1}I'm fine. What did he say?

13:33.478 --> 13:35.108
( exhales )

13:35.147 --> 13:38.017
I'm going to forward you
a recommended response

13:38.050 --> 13:39.950
{\an1}which you will put
into your own words.

13:39.984 --> 13:41.894
Send it to me.
We'll approve it

13:41.920 --> 13:43.490
and then you send it
to them.

13:43.522 --> 13:44.522
When?

13:45.123 --> 13:46.223
{\an3}Soon.

13:46.258 --> 13:47.828
How soon?

13:47.860 --> 13:50.900
{\an1}We need to control
the pace of communication.

13:50.929 --> 13:52.559
Now, this might sound
counter-intuitive,

13:52.597 --> 13:56.397
{\an1}but in our experience
with terrorist organizations,

13:56.435 --> 14:00.035
{\an1}we've found that it's best
to take things slowly.

14:01.206 --> 14:03.206
You haven't
told anybody, right?

14:05.110 --> 14:06.380
No.

14:06.411 --> 14:08.581
Agent Walsh:
<i> Good. Keep it that way.</i>

14:09.981 --> 14:11.581
<i> One more thing.</i>

14:11.616 --> 14:13.846
<i> Money cannot exchange hands.</i>

14:14.919 --> 14:15.949
<i> That's illegal.</i>

14:15.988 --> 14:17.318
Helen: <i> What?</i>

14:19.224 --> 14:22.264
<i> Well, how do we
get him back then?
What's the plan?</i>

14:22.294 --> 14:23.564
Agent Walsh:
<i> I know this is hard,</i>

14:23.595 --> 14:24.925
{\an1}<i> but we're going to
take it one step at a time.</i>

14:24.963 --> 14:27.233
Helen:
<i> You didn't answer me.</i>

14:27.265 --> 14:31.095
Agent Walsh: <i> I promise you,
this is our top priority.</i>

14:46.752 --> 14:49.222
( line ringing )

14:49.254 --> 14:51.864
{\an1}<i> You've reached the voicemail
of Charlotte Spencer.</i>

14:51.890 --> 14:53.730
{\an1}<i> Please leave a message
at the tone.</i>

14:53.759 --> 14:55.059
( tone beeps )

14:55.094 --> 14:57.064
Um, Charlotte, hi.
This is Helen.

14:57.095 --> 14:58.625
I'm sorry to keep
missing you.

14:58.664 --> 15:02.004
I'm Sheila's friend
from the club.

15:02.901 --> 15:03.941
( exhales )

15:03.969 --> 15:05.469
I really need some advice.

15:05.504 --> 15:06.814
Um...

15:06.838 --> 15:09.468
{\an1}So if you have a moment,
I'd appreciate you
returning my call.

15:09.507 --> 15:10.607
Thank you.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.307
{\an1}( beeps )

15:17.615 --> 15:19.245
( choir singing )

15:23.789 --> 15:25.059
Waitress:
<i> Can I get you anything?</i>

15:25.090 --> 15:26.890
Helen: <i> Uh, water, please.</i>

15:26.925 --> 15:28.325
Still or sparkling?

15:28.360 --> 15:30.930
Tap's good, uh,
no ice, please.

15:32.030 --> 15:34.470
{\an1}-Charlotte: Helen.
-Charlotte.

15:37.369 --> 15:38.599
( Charlotte sighs )

15:40.505 --> 15:43.635
{\an1}Let me be the first to say,
with total conviction,

15:43.675 --> 15:46.005
{\an1}that I actually do know
what you're going through.

15:48.613 --> 15:50.823
{\an1}Charlotte: First off,
I invited you
to meet me here,

15:50.849 --> 15:53.019
{\an1}so I absolutely insist
on treating you.

15:53.051 --> 15:54.991
{\an1}-Oh, that's not necessary...
-I said I insist.

15:56.254 --> 15:58.294
{\an1}I'm sure you're used to
getting your way.

15:58.323 --> 16:00.393
Well, I have been told
I'm difficult to refuse.

16:00.425 --> 16:02.325
{\an1}-( chuckles )
-Good afternoon, ladies.

16:02.361 --> 16:03.261
{\an1}Afternoon.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.295
{\an1}We will have
the Afternoon Tea Service

16:05.330 --> 16:07.170
and two glasses
of champagne.

16:07.199 --> 16:09.199
Waitress:
Very good, madam.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.004
Just because
we're meeting for tea

16:11.036 --> 16:12.636
{\an1}doesn't mean
we can't drink champagne.

16:12.670 --> 16:13.970
{\an1}( chuckles softly )

16:15.707 --> 16:17.777
So, how are you holding up?

16:17.809 --> 16:19.449
{\an1}( inhales deeply )

16:19.478 --> 16:21.278
{\an1}Honestly, I'm not sure.

16:21.312 --> 16:23.622
{\an1}-He's been gone... Andy, yes?
-Yes, Andy.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.279
{\an1}He was taken how long ago?

16:25.316 --> 16:27.916
{\an1}Uh, we lost contact
with him,

16:27.953 --> 16:30.363
two and a half months Friday.

16:30.922 --> 16:32.462
Who else is in the loop?

16:32.491 --> 16:33.591
Sheila. Now, you.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.825
But Sheila tells me
you've been in touch
with the FBI?

16:35.861 --> 16:37.161
{\an1}Oh, yes. Yeah.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.026
And they've been
utterly useless.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.368
Well, they're very nice guys.

16:41.399 --> 16:43.099
Well, that's part
of the problem.

16:43.134 --> 16:44.844
{\an1}-You think so?
-Well, yes. They talk nice.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.040
{\an1}But they don't do anything

16:46.071 --> 16:48.611
unless they're
absolutely forced.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.010
Ladies.

16:53.078 --> 16:55.308
( opera music plays )

16:55.346 --> 16:57.146
{\an1}-Shall I pour the tea?
-No.

16:59.183 --> 17:01.093
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

17:07.058 --> 17:08.828
To the safe return
of your son.

17:08.859 --> 17:10.260
{\an1}Thank you.

17:10.762 --> 17:11.801
{\an1}To Andy.

17:19.069 --> 17:20.740
Can I ask you
a personal question?

17:22.007 --> 17:23.936
Sure.

17:23.974 --> 17:25.734
Why haven't you
reached out more?

17:25.778 --> 17:28.008
{\an1}They told me
not to tell anybody.

17:28.046 --> 17:29.846
-Who, the FBI?
-Yeah.

17:29.881 --> 17:31.581
Oh, that's so stupid.

17:31.616 --> 17:34.046
{\an1}Well, they said his life
would be in danger.

17:34.085 --> 17:36.115
Well, I'm sorry, Helen.

17:36.154 --> 17:37.394
( inhales )

17:37.423 --> 17:39.563
{\an1}If they think they can
manipulate you, they will.

17:40.592 --> 17:41.732
I realize that.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.760
I'm sorry.

17:42.794 --> 17:44.334
This brings it all back
to when Leo was taken.

17:44.362 --> 17:46.772
I guess I have
some unresolved anger.

17:46.798 --> 17:48.198
( chuckles dryly )

17:49.601 --> 17:50.841
{\an1}How is Leo?

17:52.937 --> 17:54.537
Good days and bad days.

17:54.572 --> 17:57.742
{\an1}He's teaching Media Studies
at Stanford.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.106
{\an1}By the way, I looked at
some of Andy's videos online.

18:00.144 --> 18:02.114
They're really
very impressive.

18:02.147 --> 18:05.517
I... I haven't watched them.

18:05.550 --> 18:07.750
{\an1}You should.
It's really very powerful.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.586
{\an1}You know,
all the bombs going off

18:09.621 --> 18:11.921
{\an1}and being shot at
and everything, I just...

18:11.956 --> 18:13.156
I can't.

18:14.092 --> 18:16.492
I feel the same way
about Leo's work.

18:16.528 --> 18:18.958
{\an1}When he was a student,
he talked about journalism

18:18.997 --> 18:21.097
like it was
a sacred calling.

18:21.132 --> 18:23.642
I was so proud of him.
I encouraged him.

18:24.669 --> 18:27.609
{\an1}Then when he shipped himself
off to Kandahar,

18:27.639 --> 18:31.579
{\an1}I'd wished we had canceled
our subscription to the <i> Times</i>
years ago.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.980
( chuckles )

18:33.011 --> 18:36.381
{\an1}I don't really know
where Andy gets it.

18:36.414 --> 18:38.224
Well, aren't you
an emergency room nurse?

18:38.683 --> 18:40.083
So?

18:40.118 --> 18:41.288
You don't see the parallels?

18:41.320 --> 18:43.890
{\an1}No, I don't put my life
on the line.

18:48.059 --> 18:49.459
I have to ask you.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.262
How did you get him back?

18:52.297 --> 18:56.137
Hmm. Certainly not by
being quiet about it.

18:56.634 --> 18:58.444
{\an1}Who'd you talk to?

19:00.205 --> 19:02.635
We have friends
who have friends.
( exhales )

19:03.608 --> 19:05.438
{\an1}Yeah, I don't have
those kind of friends.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.307
Well, you don't know
unless you ask.

19:07.345 --> 19:09.605
{\an1}Nobody I know
has that kind of money.

19:09.648 --> 19:10.718
What kind of money?

19:12.851 --> 19:14.621
( softly )
Ransom money.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.263
We didn't pay a ransom
to release Leo.

19:18.956 --> 19:20.286
Did the military go in?

19:20.325 --> 19:22.185
No, no, they don't do that.

19:23.228 --> 19:24.528
( chuckles )

19:24.562 --> 19:26.532
I feel like you're telling me
to read between the lines,

19:26.564 --> 19:30.274
{\an1}but I don't even see
the lines, so I don't get it.

19:30.802 --> 19:32.542
Well,

19:32.570 --> 19:34.210
there's a balance
to be struck

19:34.239 --> 19:36.239
{\an1}between asserting yourself

19:36.274 --> 19:38.084
{\an1}and coming on too strong.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.540
{\an1}Okay.

19:39.578 --> 19:40.678
( inhales )

19:40.712 --> 19:43.252
I have to admit,
I sometimes wonder

19:43.281 --> 19:44.981
if I would have done better

19:45.016 --> 19:47.346
had I been more
anonymous myself.

19:47.919 --> 19:49.619
What does that mean?

19:49.654 --> 19:52.764
Well, the more people
who know, the more
false leads you get.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.230
The more e-mails,

19:54.259 --> 19:56.159
from Pakistan, Qatar,

19:56.194 --> 19:58.434
telling you that for
$10,000 in Bitcoin

19:58.463 --> 20:00.403
they can give you
the GPS coordinates

20:00.431 --> 20:03.271
of where the terrorist
is keeping your son.

20:03.301 --> 20:04.971
And maybe they can.
Maybe they do know.

20:06.838 --> 20:11.078
So you have to deal
with the consequences
of your decision.

20:11.109 --> 20:15.479
Do you scrape together
enough money to spread
around some

20:15.514 --> 20:18.854
dubious Middle Eastern
bribery network?

20:18.884 --> 20:19.894
Or,

20:21.153 --> 20:24.493
{\an1}<i>do you just decide to swallow
the awful thought</i>

20:24.522 --> 20:26.962
{\an1}<i> that maybe you could have
done something more?</i>

20:29.126 --> 20:31.256
( siren wailing in distance )

20:51.282 --> 20:53.352
Can I ask you something?

20:53.384 --> 20:55.924
Excuse me. Excuse me,
I have a question.

20:56.754 --> 21:00.464
I may be, uh, wiring
a large sum of money

21:00.492 --> 21:02.562
to another country,
and I...

21:02.594 --> 21:04.504
How do you do that
from here?

21:06.231 --> 21:08.971
Oh, no I already saw
this form online.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.640
And what it says
is that, uh,

21:10.668 --> 21:14.438
if you want to transfer
over $10,000
internationally,

21:14.472 --> 21:15.842
you have to get some
kind of permission,

21:15.873 --> 21:17.043
so that's why I'm here.

21:18.043 --> 21:19.983
{\an1}To ask you for permission.

21:22.547 --> 21:23.777
Where's the money going?

21:25.216 --> 21:27.846
Let's say, um, Syria.

21:27.885 --> 21:31.415
{\an1}Could you send
a large amount of money
to Syria?

21:32.057 --> 21:33.987
S-Y-R-I-A.

21:37.929 --> 21:39.059
Nope.

21:39.096 --> 21:40.556
Turkey?

21:40.598 --> 21:41.768
Call the number
on the form.

21:41.799 --> 21:43.699
No, look, how much
could I send to Turkey?

21:43.735 --> 21:46.695
-Next in line, please.
-No, not next in line.

21:46.738 --> 21:48.868
I asked you
a fucking question.

22:05.557 --> 22:07.287
{\an1}-Can I... Can I...
-Oh.

22:07.325 --> 22:09.055
{\an1}-The bedrooms?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.710
Water pressure's
really strong.

22:29.547 --> 22:31.977
Helen: <i> Can we list it
for a little bit more?</i>

22:32.017 --> 22:34.847
realtor: <i> Well, it's what
the market will hold.</i>

22:34.886 --> 22:35.986
<i> I mean,</i>

22:36.588 --> 22:38.558
{\an1}it may even be
a teardown.

22:50.235 --> 22:52.095
Can we do it without
a sign on the lawn?

22:53.672 --> 22:55.372
{\an1}Not if you want it
to sell.

23:04.115 --> 23:05.575
( sighs )

23:05.617 --> 23:08.517
{\an1}Look, Miss Sterling,
you told me you wanted
to sell this urgently.

23:10.822 --> 23:12.162

{\an1}-Her name's Kayla?
-Yes.

24:39.244 --> 24:41.354
{\an1}She went in the ambulance
before me.

24:41.379 --> 24:42.549
{\an1}-Well, we're gonna find her.
-Okay.

24:42.580 --> 24:43.750
We're gonna find her.
Let's see here.

24:43.782 --> 24:45.122
{\an1}I let her go
in the ambulance
without me.

24:45.149 --> 24:46.679
Right. Well, that's
the right thing to do.

24:46.717 --> 24:47.787
We're going to find her.
Sit down.

24:47.818 --> 24:48.948
{\an1}nurse:
Anybody call anesthesia?

24:48.986 --> 24:50.656

Multiple gunshot wounds.
Coming in.

<i> We have seven victims,
expecting multiple traumas.</i>

24:53.824 --> 24:55.394

<i> We need more ambulances.</i>

We need to
intubate immediately.

tried to contact
any of their parents?

and just started shooting.

I'm sorry.

{\an1}What are you going to say
to the family?

27:30.582 --> 27:31.882
I don't know.

27:34.485 --> 27:36.115
{\an1}You've got to be clear.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.324
You've got to be strong.

27:37.355 --> 27:39.855
{\an1}This is the worst news
they're ever going to hear,

27:39.891 --> 27:42.761
{\an1}and nothing you can say
is going to make it better.

27:43.260 --> 27:45.460
{\an1}Be clear, be strong.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.867
{\an1}Practice on me.

27:49.467 --> 27:50.897
Um...

27:51.635 --> 27:53.735
I... I regret
to inform you...

27:53.771 --> 27:56.211
{\an1}No, stop. It's not about
you and your regret.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.180
{\an1}Be clear. Be strong.

28:01.879 --> 28:03.979
Your son didn't make it.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.115
We did everything we could.

I'm so very sorry
for your loss.

28:11.222 --> 28:12.292
Good.

28:13.591 --> 28:14.861
Do it just like that.

{\an1}I'm looking for
the parents of...

Your son didn't make it.

28:49.594 --> 28:51.304
{\an1}He died. We did
everything we could...

28:51.329 --> 28:54.329
{\an1}What are you saying?
What are you talking about?

28:54.365 --> 28:56.265
You didn't do anything!

28:56.300 --> 28:58.340
{\an1}( sobbing )
You didn't do anything!

29:12.450 --> 29:14.890
( woman continues sobbing )

29:15.386 --> 29:16.956
( rain pattering )

29:28.833 --> 29:30.173
( seat belt unlocks )

30:10.474 --> 30:12.384
{\an1}( faint scraping )

30:24.722 --> 30:26.322
( Andy sighs )

30:27.525 --> 30:28.955
( clattering )

30:33.431 --> 30:35.301
Eighty kinds of oil
at the Hannaford's now,

30:35.332 --> 30:37.902
this is the only one
that's any good.

30:37.935 --> 30:39.995
But I love the way
they've remodeled.

30:40.037 --> 30:41.567
It looks really great.
Right?

30:41.605 --> 30:43.205
It's a consumer's paradise.

30:43.241 --> 30:46.911
{\an1}They throw away more food
in a day than I saw
in a month in Kabul.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.045
{\an1}Well, they do
donate a lot of it
to the group home.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.220
{\an1}They're very good
with the community
that way.

30:51.248 --> 30:53.348
{\an1}It's good PR
that costs them nothing.

30:53.384 --> 30:55.194
reporter: ( on radio )
<i> ...killed at least 40 people</i>

30:55.219 --> 30:57.349
<i> and wounded dozens more...</i>

30:57.388 --> 30:58.858
( radio turns off )

31:01.993 --> 31:03.433
You don't want to hear it?

31:03.461 --> 31:04.631
Not secondhand.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.667
Okay, why are you so angry?

31:11.703 --> 31:13.273
I'm not angry, Mom.

31:17.475 --> 31:19.035
I'm frustrated.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.882
{\an1}-I'm totally useless here.
-( scoffs )

31:22.914 --> 31:24.784
Baby, you're not useless.

31:24.815 --> 31:26.215
{\an1}I don't want to hurt
your feelings,

31:26.250 --> 31:28.190
{\an1}but there's no way
you can understand
what I'm going through.

31:28.218 --> 31:30.118
{\an1}Well, how can I understand it
when you don't talk to me

31:30.154 --> 31:33.524
and you keep it all
locked inside you?

31:33.925 --> 31:35.955
( sighs deeply )

31:42.500 --> 31:43.970
It's not enough for me here.

31:47.005 --> 31:48.365
It's never been.

31:49.807 --> 31:51.107
This life...

31:52.410 --> 31:53.680
This way of living.

31:54.845 --> 31:56.475
I'm suffocating.

31:58.815 --> 32:00.115
Well...

32:00.150 --> 32:02.250
Maybe it's time for you
to get your own place.

32:02.286 --> 32:03.786
Oh! Where?

32:03.821 --> 32:05.121
Downtown Oneonta?

32:06.357 --> 32:08.157
So I can be close
to the action?

32:09.260 --> 32:10.630
{\an1}Another meth-head arrested

32:10.661 --> 32:12.531
and I get
the front page article
in the <i> Daily Star?</i>

32:13.363 --> 32:14.633
( scoffs )

32:14.665 --> 32:17.565
{\an1}Oh, you always
looked down on everyone
and everything here.

32:17.601 --> 32:19.571
{\an1}Right?
You're so much better
than everybody

32:19.603 --> 32:21.843
{\an1}and I'm just stupid
and I can't understand

32:21.872 --> 32:22.972
'cause I'm just dumb!

32:23.007 --> 32:24.937
{\an1}Damn it, you want this
to be about you!

32:25.910 --> 32:27.250
{\an1}I'm not your partner, Mom.

32:28.612 --> 32:29.582
I love you,

32:29.614 --> 32:32.584
but I'm sick of feeling
responsible for you

32:32.617 --> 32:33.847
every time
I make a decision.

32:33.884 --> 32:35.494
{\an1}Oh, please.
Make a decision.

32:35.519 --> 32:38.319
{\an1}I would love for you
to make a decision
as a grown-up!

32:38.356 --> 32:42.026
Go ahead. And just don't
drag me into your drama.

32:43.961 --> 32:45.631
I have made a decision.

32:46.931 --> 32:48.201
I'm going back.

32:52.770 --> 32:54.470
( rain pattering )

33:03.981 --> 33:06.521
{\an8}Helen: You know what
I'm confused about...
And maybe I'm wrong,

33:06.550 --> 33:09.520
{\an8}but I thought that
you would be a lot more
used to violence,

33:09.553 --> 33:10.563
{\an8}coming from Iran.

33:11.455 --> 33:12.615
-Iran?
-Yeah.

33:13.491 --> 33:16.531
{\an1}No. They arrest you
for having a gun.

33:16.560 --> 33:17.730
Really?

33:17.762 --> 33:18.962
{\an1}Right. Yeah.

33:18.996 --> 33:21.666
{\an1}Anyone in the mood
for some day-old cake?

33:22.266 --> 33:23.526
I'll pass.

33:24.735 --> 33:25.965
{\an1}( Keesha chuckles )

33:26.003 --> 33:27.203
{\an1}Helen, um...

33:27.237 --> 33:29.407
{\an1}Is Andy coming home
for Christmas?

33:31.708 --> 33:33.038
January.

33:33.077 --> 33:35.947
You want me to cover
Christmas shift?

33:35.979 --> 33:37.949
Mmm, am I that obvious?

33:37.982 --> 33:39.852
You got it, boss,
but you owe me.

33:39.883 --> 33:41.123
{\an1}Thank you.

33:41.151 --> 33:42.551
{\an8}All right, I'm going in.

33:42.586 --> 33:43.886
{\an1}-( Keesha coughs )
-( cell phone chimes )

33:43.920 --> 33:45.760
{\an1}Reza: Oh, hold on.
Wait for me.

33:47.424 --> 33:48.364
{\an1}( Reza sighs )

33:48.392 --> 33:50.562
-( monitors beeping )
-( ventilator hissing )

34:01.572 --> 34:02.772
Good morning, Amy.

34:04.509 --> 34:06.879
{\an1}How is your arm today?

34:06.910 --> 34:09.150
{\an1}Jeez, I keep forgetting
I got shot.

34:09.746 --> 34:11.007
{\an1}Arm's fine.

34:11.047 --> 34:13.217
Kayla is stable.

34:13.251 --> 34:15.621
Maybe you want to get
some rest.

34:15.652 --> 34:17.661
{\an1}Am I on some kind of
painkillers or something?

34:17.688 --> 34:20.257
{\an1}It's weird, 'cause
I can't feel anything.

34:20.290 --> 34:21.530
I mean, like, anything.

34:23.427 --> 34:24.897
{\an1}Reza: Amy,
how's your shoulder?

34:24.929 --> 34:27.399
It's fine. I think
you should check
on my daughter.

34:29.366 --> 34:31.136
{\an1}I'm trying.
If I could just...

34:31.168 --> 34:32.369
Amy, why don't you
come with me,

34:32.402 --> 34:33.973
{\an1}we'll get a cup of coffee

34:34.005 --> 34:37.505
and let Dr. Rahimi
do his tests.

34:41.978 --> 34:43.449
{\an1}( indistinct announcements
over PA )

34:46.817 --> 34:48.217
Dr. Rahimi's a good doctor.

34:48.251 --> 34:50.791
I can't even understand
what he's saying.

34:50.821 --> 34:52.960
{\an1}Well, I'm going to
tell you something
that I probably shouldn't,

34:52.989 --> 34:54.730
{\an1}and that is that
he has been spending

34:54.757 --> 34:57.088
more time with Kayla than
any of this other patients.

34:57.127 --> 34:59.797
{\an1}I'm sorry.
Uh, we need you
right away, Helen.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.231
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.195
{\an1}Um, I'll take a rain check
on the coffee,

35:03.233 --> 35:05.073
and I'll find you
and explain to you

35:05.102 --> 35:06.802
{\an1}everything we're doing
with Kayla, okay?

35:08.672 --> 35:11.082
-Okay, Helen.
-Okay.

35:11.108 --> 35:13.208
Cafeteria's on
the third floor.

35:13.244 --> 35:14.854
{\an1}-What's up?
-Auditor's on the way.

35:14.878 --> 35:17.278
I need to get the snacks
and coffee out of
the break room.

35:17.315 --> 35:19.575
{\an1}-All of our snacks?
-Yes, it's a mess in there.

35:19.616 --> 35:22.246
Can you please sign off
the check sheets?

35:22.286 --> 35:24.916
{\an1}Yeah. Oh, shit.
I thought I had.
I'm sorry.

35:24.955 --> 35:26.455
It's okay. All right.
Thanks, Helen.

35:30.828 --> 35:32.458
Helen: Good morning, Kayla.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.627
{\an1}It's December 5th.
Can you hear me?

35:39.770 --> 35:41.270
( cell phone chimes )

35:44.841 --> 35:47.211
Helen:
<i> I just sent it to you.
Did you get it?</i>

35:47.911 --> 35:49.251
That number can't be right.

35:49.279 --> 35:51.919
They can't expect me
to raise $20 million.

35:54.051 --> 35:55.391
Okay.

35:56.387 --> 35:57.457
Yeah.

35:58.989 --> 36:00.559
Yes, I understand.

36:08.866 --> 36:10.196
( sighs )

36:16.807 --> 36:18.407
( exhales )

36:26.917 --> 36:28.317
Mom, I can't do this.

36:30.821 --> 36:31.891
( grunts )

37:16.033 --> 37:17.333
Pauline: Would you like
some coffee?

37:17.367 --> 37:18.797
I'm good. Thanks.

37:25.309 --> 37:26.909
{\an1}( footsteps approaching )

37:29.413 --> 37:31.623
{\an1}Thank you for coming in,
Miss Sterling.

37:31.648 --> 37:34.648
I hope it's not
too much trouble.

37:34.684 --> 37:37.794
{\an1}Oh, not at all.
I've been trying to see you
for a while now.

37:37.821 --> 37:41.091
{\an1}And actually,
I have an appointment
right across the plaza.

37:41.125 --> 37:43.485
{\an1}So you're going to be
seeing the FBI?

37:43.527 --> 37:45.357
{\an1}Yeah. Right after this.

37:45.396 --> 37:46.996
You guys don't talk
to each other?

37:47.031 --> 37:48.471
Is there anything
we should know?

37:49.500 --> 37:51.370
Yeah, I got an e-mail.

37:51.402 --> 37:53.802
{\an1}Now, I know it's illegal
to pay any ransom,

37:53.837 --> 37:55.507
but I was thinking,

37:55.539 --> 37:57.239
what about
a prisoner exchange?

37:57.274 --> 37:59.914
I know that a soldier
that went AWOL

37:59.943 --> 38:02.013
and got captured,
that's what you guys
did there,

38:02.046 --> 38:03.406
a prisoner exchange,
right?

38:03.447 --> 38:05.777
Dulaney:
Apples and oranges.
Military and civilians.

38:05.816 --> 38:08.716
{\an1}It's entirely different
when you're sent
over there with a uniform.

38:08.752 --> 38:11.362
Oh. How is it
different, exactly?

38:11.388 --> 38:13.458
Well, as I'm sure,
the FBI told you,

38:13.490 --> 38:15.930
they consider this to be
a criminal investigation.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.360
{\an1}-Right.
-Businessmen, tourists,

38:18.395 --> 38:21.065
they're over there on
their own volition.

38:21.098 --> 38:24.268
{\an1}Whereas with men
and women who are
serving our country,

38:24.301 --> 38:26.971
{\an1}different rules
and practices apply.

38:27.004 --> 38:29.044
{\an1}But Andy was serving
our country.

38:29.073 --> 38:30.273
He just wasn't
in a uniform.

38:30.307 --> 38:31.907
I mean, he wasn't
there on vacation.

38:31.942 --> 38:34.482
{\an1}Andrew was in a place
he should not have been.

38:36.981 --> 38:40.221
A lot of people think
the military shouldn't
be in that place.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.221
Let's not
debate politics.

38:42.252 --> 38:43.622
It's not politics.

38:44.154 --> 38:45.464
It's my son,

38:46.257 --> 38:47.987
who is an American citizen.

38:48.025 --> 38:52.425
{\an1}Isn't it your job to protect
American citizens abroad?

38:52.462 --> 38:54.602
That is a part
of my job, yes.

38:55.199 --> 38:56.929
{\an1}My heart goes out to you,

38:56.967 --> 38:58.337
as it does to your boy,

38:58.368 --> 39:01.368
and every other person
in a conflict zone,

39:01.405 --> 39:02.665
{\an1}whether they volunteered,

39:02.706 --> 39:05.476
or whether they
found themselves
in a situation

39:05.509 --> 39:07.609
they were not
adequately prepared for.

39:07.644 --> 39:10.084
He's been a journalist
for 15 years.
He was prepared.

39:10.113 --> 39:11.783
{\an1}-Then he knew the risks.
-Yes.

39:11.815 --> 39:14.245
And I'm sure he wouldn't
want to risk other lives

39:14.284 --> 39:15.494
on a military operation

39:15.519 --> 39:18.259
{\an1}that wasn't even guaranteed
to bring him home.

39:18.289 --> 39:19.689
Those people
have families, too.

39:19.723 --> 39:22.733
So you feel it was
Andy's fault that
he got captured,

39:22.759 --> 39:24.999
{\an1}and you won't risk
sending your people
in to help him?

39:25.028 --> 39:26.898
I hope you don't think
I'm suggesting that.

39:26.931 --> 39:30.031
It sounds like it.
What are you doing?

39:30.067 --> 39:32.267
{\an1}Okay, look, this is
a very complicated process,

39:32.302 --> 39:35.142
{\an1}and it needs to be handled
by people that understand
the region.

39:35.172 --> 39:37.042
{\an1}Helen: Right. Well,
who is that, then?

39:40.377 --> 39:42.447
I don't want to
disparage the FBI,

39:42.479 --> 39:44.209
{\an1}but I do know
from experience

39:44.247 --> 39:45.617
what is effective
and what is not.

39:45.649 --> 39:48.519
Then what is effective?
What is the plan?

39:48.552 --> 39:49.752
What are you gonna do?

39:49.786 --> 39:52.956
{\an1}Unfortunately, Miss Sterling,
that information

39:52.989 --> 39:54.559
is classified.

39:56.193 --> 39:58.103
I'm his mother.

39:58.128 --> 39:59.558
You can rest assured

39:59.596 --> 40:02.526
{\an1}knowing that we're doing
all that we can.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.636
{\an1}Now, maybe it would
help us all

40:04.668 --> 40:06.838
{\an1}if you were to tell us
what progress
the FBI has made.

40:06.870 --> 40:09.170
{\an8}You know what?
You can fucking
ask them yourself.

40:16.713 --> 40:17.883
Agent Walsh:
<i> So, State Department.</i>

40:17.914 --> 40:19.124
{\an1}<i> What did you guys
talk about over there?</i>

40:19.149 --> 40:22.249
Helen: <i> Can't you guys
just talk to each other?</i>

40:22.286 --> 40:24.086
{\an1}Maybe I should take things
into my own hands.

40:24.121 --> 40:25.461
Be careful with that.

40:25.489 --> 40:29.029
Oh, okay. I'll shut up
and let the grown-ups
handle everything.

40:29.059 --> 40:29.959
That's not what I meant.

40:29.993 --> 40:34.733
{\an1}You are a crucial part
of this investigation.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.995
{\an1}Yeah. Lying to everyone
I know has been vital
to this investigation.

40:38.034 --> 40:39.574
It's keeping Andy alive.

40:42.139 --> 40:43.539
So...

40:43.573 --> 40:47.243
You want me to negotiate
the price of my son's life

40:47.277 --> 40:49.777
{\an1}down further and further
on your behalf,

40:49.813 --> 40:52.853
{\an1}even though you have
no intention of paying it?

40:52.883 --> 40:55.893
{\an1}For what? Just to see
how low they'll go?

40:55.919 --> 40:58.759
{\an1}There's a science
to negotiating, Helen.

40:58.789 --> 40:59.989
We study it.

41:00.023 --> 41:02.063
{\an1}The longer we stay
in communication with them,

41:02.092 --> 41:04.032
the more we understand
who we're dealing with

41:04.060 --> 41:05.130
and what they really want.

41:05.162 --> 41:08.002
It's been three months.
What have you learned?

41:08.032 --> 41:09.072
{\an1}You have to trust us.

41:09.099 --> 41:11.139
What do you think
I've been doing
all this time,

41:11.168 --> 41:13.898
while you guys just
play cat and mouse
with those fuckers?

41:13.938 --> 41:16.438
I swear to Christ,
if something happens
to my child,

41:16.473 --> 41:18.983
{\an1}because you're waiting
to sign off on some form...

41:25.782 --> 41:27.792
{\an1}This is the response
we recommend.

41:28.852 --> 41:30.722
Where it says Proof of Life,

41:30.754 --> 41:34.564
{\an1}you have to be very personal,
very specific.

41:34.591 --> 41:38.501
{\an1}It has to be a question
only you would know
to ask,

41:38.529 --> 41:40.099
{\an1}and an answer
only he could answer.

43:05.415 --> 43:06.875
( sighs )

43:09.452 --> 43:10.752
I don't wanna fight.

43:14.458 --> 43:15.828
You can smile.

43:15.859 --> 43:17.159
{\an1}-( chuckles )
-( camera shutter clicks )

43:53.530 --> 43:54.930
( keys clacking )

44:04.808 --> 44:06.708
Sam: <i> Come on, Louganis,
what you got?</i>

44:06.743 --> 44:07.943
<i> -What you got?</i>
-( man exclaims )

44:07.977 --> 44:10.147
-( water splashes )
<i> -Oh! Oh, God!</i>

44:10.947 --> 44:12.517
<i> Oh, you ready?
You ready?</i>

44:12.549 --> 44:14.919
<i> Oh, my lord!</i>

44:14.952 --> 44:16.792
<i> How do you excuse that?</i>

44:16.820 --> 44:18.820
<i> Because I am not
burning this.</i>

44:18.855 --> 44:20.785
<i> Of course it's in focus.</i>

44:21.992 --> 44:23.792
{\an1}<i> Now if you were operating,
I don't know</i>

44:23.826 --> 44:25.856
<i> it'd be much more
questionable to me.</i>

44:25.895 --> 44:27.295
{\an1}<i> Okay, all right,
come here.</i>

44:29.066 --> 44:31.526
<i> This is
my best friend, Sam.</i>

44:31.568 --> 44:32.898
<i> Say hello
to the civilians.</i>

44:32.936 --> 44:35.836
<i> -Hello. Hello, civilians.</i>
-( chuckles )

44:35.872 --> 44:37.212
{\an1}Andy: <i> I love this man.</i>

44:37.240 --> 44:39.410
{\an1}<i>He's taught me
everything worth knowing.</i>

44:39.443 --> 44:40.683
{\an1}Sam: <i> Oh, then you're
in trouble, man.</i>

44:45.148 --> 44:46.348
( whooping )

44:47.951 --> 44:49.721
{\an1}woman: <i> We are here,
having fun!</i>

44:55.158 --> 44:56.428
( keys clacking )

44:59.329 --> 45:01.699
Andy: <i> Classes have been
officially suspended here</i>

45:01.731 --> 45:03.331
<i> in the city of Homs,</i>

45:03.367 --> 45:06.697
{\an1}<i> but every day, kids still
gather in the schoolyard
for games.</i>

45:06.736 --> 45:09.066
{\an8}( conversing in Arabic )

45:11.541 --> 45:13.041
{\an8}( singing in Arabic )

45:18.782 --> 45:19.982
{\an7}( explosion )

45:20.483 --> 45:22.393
{\an1}( people screaming )

45:27.324 --> 45:29.134
( men speak Arabic )

45:36.200 --> 45:37.770
man: <i> Allahu Akbar!</i>

45:39.303 --> 45:40.443
( explosion )

45:41.738 --> 45:43.238
( woman speaking Arabic )

45:50.613 --> 45:52.323
{\an1}( baby cries )

45:53.583 --> 45:54.993
Andy: <i> As you can see,</i>

45:55.018 --> 45:57.548
{\an1}<i> these attacks make
no distinction
between civilian</i>

45:57.587 --> 45:59.157
<i> and military targets.</i>

45:59.189 --> 46:02.529
{\an1}<i> Forty percent of
the casualties here
are, like Yana,</i>

46:02.559 --> 46:05.199
<i> children under
the age of 12.</i>

46:06.496 --> 46:08.096
{\an8}<i> And the children who survive</i>

46:08.131 --> 46:11.671
{\an7}<i> have lost their friends,
their school,</i>

46:11.702 --> 46:13.102
{\an1}<i>and their faith</i>

46:13.136 --> 46:15.336
{\an1}<i>that the most powerful
country in the world</i>

46:15.371 --> 46:16.811
<i>will come to protect them.</i>

46:23.780 --> 46:26.150
{\an1}<i> Yeah. Charlotte?
Charlotte, this is Helen.</i>

46:26.683 --> 46:28.353
I...

46:30.454 --> 46:33.524
{\an1}I'm overwhelmed.
I would appreciate you
returning my call.

46:44.434 --> 46:48.844
{\an1}All right, Kayla,
I'm going to be filling in
for your mom tonight.

46:48.872 --> 46:51.682
With <i> The Sea of Knowledge.</i>

46:51.708 --> 46:54.308
{\an1}"Now, it may be hard
to imagine it,

46:54.344 --> 46:56.554
{\an1}"but this land was
once so barren,

46:56.580 --> 46:58.880
{\an1}"it was called
the Kingdom of Salt.

46:58.916 --> 47:02.216
{\an1}"The lush green hills
that we walk today
were once so dry

47:02.252 --> 47:04.392
{\an1}"and cracked that trees
could not grow here.

47:04.421 --> 47:07.361
{\an1}<i> "No visitors had dared
enter the Kingdom,</i>

47:07.390 --> 47:10.490
<i> "for it was said terrible
monsters roamed the land.</i>

47:10.526 --> 47:13.156
{\an1}<i> "But it was also said
that on the other side..."</i>

47:19.669 --> 47:21.539
Helen.

47:21.571 --> 47:23.341
Let's talk in my office.

47:27.077 --> 47:29.877
( telephone ringing )

47:30.947 --> 47:33.217
( indistinct chatter )

47:34.517 --> 47:35.887
Helen, sit.

47:42.659 --> 47:44.459
{\an1}This isn't Helen's fault.

47:44.494 --> 47:46.364
I forgot to sign the order.

47:46.396 --> 47:47.426
It's both of you.

47:47.464 --> 47:50.134
It's her access code
and your name
is on the paper,

47:50.166 --> 47:52.096
{\an1}and there's no patient name,
and now,

47:52.135 --> 47:54.595
the antibiotic count is short
in the middle of an audit.

47:54.638 --> 47:56.508
It's not
Dr. Rahimi's fault.

47:56.539 --> 47:58.639
{\an1}It was Andy's ex-girlfriend,
and she didn't
have insurance.

47:58.675 --> 48:01.435
{\an1}We're two quarters away
from shutting down
an entire wing, Helen.

48:01.478 --> 48:03.878
{\an1}Well, I didn't become
a nurse to make a profit
for a hospital.

48:03.913 --> 48:06.353
{\an1}Don't do that.
Do not make this personal,

48:06.382 --> 48:08.352
it's not like you.

48:08.385 --> 48:10.715
{\an1}We're not in
the miracles business.

48:10.754 --> 48:12.664
It's only luck
and procedure.

48:12.689 --> 48:15.829
And the minute you start
falling in love
with the patients,

48:15.859 --> 48:17.389
and reading to the patients,

48:17.427 --> 48:20.397
making exceptions
to the procedures,
you lose trust.

48:24.801 --> 48:28.211
Are you okay, Helen?
Is there something
going on with you?

48:33.609 --> 48:34.939
I'm fine.

48:34.978 --> 48:37.478
( telephone rings )

48:40.583 --> 48:41.993
Keesha: Keesha Thompson.

48:44.187 --> 48:46.387
Helen: And some soup,
Mary. Thanks.

48:47.990 --> 48:49.460
{\an1}Here you go, Helen.

48:49.492 --> 48:50.692
Thank you.

48:57.700 --> 49:00.440
Sam: <i> I'm here
because I was told
you were overwhelmed.</i>

49:00.469 --> 49:02.969
Look, I worked in
the same region as Andy

49:03.006 --> 49:04.936
{\an1}just before he was taken.

49:05.876 --> 49:07.036
{\an1}I would have called first,

49:07.076 --> 49:09.406
but Sheila said privacy
is important to you.

49:09.445 --> 49:12.275
( whispering )
Yeah, so you show up
at my place of work?

49:12.315 --> 49:13.775
( sighs )

49:13.817 --> 49:16.117
It's not right that
they're forcing you

49:16.152 --> 49:17.992
to keep this
all to yourself.

49:21.124 --> 49:23.534
{\an1}Look, I don't want to
endanger him any further.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.530
Well, secrecy isn't
going to help him.

49:25.561 --> 49:28.701
We need the media
and public outrage
to help us.

49:28.732 --> 49:30.032
You need to go public
with this.

49:30.066 --> 49:31.266
The FBI explained to me...

49:31.301 --> 49:35.041
I'm sure they told you
a lot of things,

49:35.071 --> 49:36.771
but we don't think
Andy would want you

49:36.807 --> 49:39.637
to trust the FBI
to handle this.

49:39.676 --> 49:41.976
When Leo was taken,
they sent in the FBI
at first...

49:42.011 --> 49:44.781
{\an1}What... They sent in
the FBI for Leo?

49:44.814 --> 49:46.384
{\an3}Yes.

49:46.416 --> 49:49.686
And it would have been
comical if it wasn't
so utterly fucked up.

49:49.719 --> 49:53.259
People get seen talking
with huge Americans
with buzz cuts,

49:53.289 --> 49:55.289
{\an1}and two weeks later,
there's a local translator

49:55.325 --> 49:57.555
getting beheaded on a video.

49:57.594 --> 49:59.004
-On a video?
-Yes.

49:59.028 --> 50:01.458
They make movies
of this shit.

50:01.498 --> 50:04.668
As a warning to anyone
who's thinking about
aiding the infidels.

50:06.969 --> 50:09.939
So you've spoken
with Charlotte Spencer?

50:09.973 --> 50:12.013
{\an1}Yeah, I helped get
the money across the border

50:12.041 --> 50:13.081
for Leo's release.

50:13.109 --> 50:14.139
She didn't pay ransom.

50:14.177 --> 50:15.277
They all pay ransom.

50:15.311 --> 50:17.451
Would you fucking
keep your voice down?

50:22.251 --> 50:23.921
I wanted to get
those cochlear implants,

50:23.953 --> 50:25.263
but I can't afford them.

50:27.023 --> 50:28.363
I know. I guess
I could've picked

50:28.391 --> 50:29.861
something less loud
to take pictures of.

50:29.892 --> 50:32.832
{\an1}Yeah, you could have
picked a job that
wouldn't ruin your hearing

50:32.862 --> 50:34.262
and put your life in danger.

50:35.298 --> 50:36.598
Well...

50:36.632 --> 50:39.642
{\an1}For better or worse,
I have my people already.

50:40.870 --> 50:42.470
And Andy is one of them.

50:45.675 --> 50:47.775
We don't have a union.

50:47.811 --> 50:49.181
{\an1}We don't have
a news organization

50:49.212 --> 50:50.652
providing a security detail.

50:50.680 --> 50:53.080
We don't have major
networks insuring us.

50:53.116 --> 50:54.976
{\an1}We have to be our
own network.

50:55.018 --> 50:56.348
We have each other.

50:57.620 --> 51:00.760
I'm here for Andy
the same way
Andy would find my dad

51:00.790 --> 51:02.330
if something happened to me.

51:02.358 --> 51:04.688
{\an1}Now I know you've been told
to keep this all quiet,

51:04.727 --> 51:06.227
{\an1}and that you're not allowed
to pay a dime.

51:06.262 --> 51:08.502
But there's only one thing
these assholes respond to,

51:08.532 --> 51:10.072
and it's money.

51:10.801 --> 51:12.171
So if you want,

51:12.202 --> 51:14.572
{\an1}we can connect you
with people who
won't rip you off.

51:15.338 --> 51:17.108
I'll fly over there myself.

51:21.077 --> 51:23.107
( sirens wailing in distance )

51:30.086 --> 51:31.346
( doorbell rings )

51:32.054 --> 51:33.594
( speaks Arabic )

51:34.824 --> 51:36.694
-Hello.
-Hi.

51:36.726 --> 51:38.126
-Thank you.
-Come on in.

51:38.161 --> 51:39.561
Thanks so much.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.270
( speaks Arabic )

51:48.905 --> 51:50.365
Sam: Hey, you made it!

51:51.341 --> 51:53.081
{\an1}-Helen, you want a beer?
-No, thanks.

51:53.109 --> 51:54.709
{\an1}Charlotte:
I'll take it, Sam.

51:55.745 --> 51:57.345
( sighs )

52:01.884 --> 52:04.024
Great house. Beautiful.

52:04.054 --> 52:05.394
Ah, thank you.

52:05.421 --> 52:07.321
{\an1}It was my grandfather's,
originally.

52:07.356 --> 52:08.356
{\an1}Oh.

52:10.526 --> 52:12.226
( continues speaking Arabic )

52:15.098 --> 52:18.328
{\an1}Maybe I could
use the ladies' room?

52:18.367 --> 52:19.697
{\an1}Sure.
It's up the stairs.

52:19.735 --> 52:22.135
{\an1}You make a left at
the painting of the dancers.

52:22.171 --> 52:24.111
Oh, thanks.

52:24.140 --> 52:26.280
( Sheila speaking Arabic )

53:00.910 --> 53:03.210
( continues speaking Arabic )

53:16.259 --> 53:17.659
{\an1}Charlotte:
We knew it wouldn't be easy.

53:17.694 --> 53:20.264
Sam: She's gonna need
a lot more prep.

53:20.296 --> 53:23.426
This is not
her world, Charlotte.

53:23.466 --> 53:24.726
Charlotte: She is
who she is, Sam.

53:24.767 --> 53:26.337
{\an1}I'm not going to give her
elocution lessons.

53:26.369 --> 53:28.609
Sam: Well, we better
do something fast,

53:28.638 --> 53:31.308
{\an1}before they move him again
and we have no one to talk to.

53:31.341 --> 53:33.541
{\an1}Charlotte: Sure.
Will you help me
carry these, please?

53:35.778 --> 53:38.808
{\an1}( laughs sarcastically )
Making jokes like that,
I'm gonna hire you.

53:38.848 --> 53:40.748
{\an1}( in British accent )
Would you like your tea
and crumpets at the usual hour?

53:40.783 --> 53:41.653
Of course.

53:41.685 --> 53:43.515
How is this
going to work, exactly?

53:43.553 --> 53:46.293
Who's responsible for what?

53:46.322 --> 53:48.592
With Leo, there was
a fundraising team

53:48.624 --> 53:50.864
{\an1}and the team that
delivered the money abroad.

53:50.893 --> 53:53.633
Charlotte should obviously
take the lead on fundraising.

53:53.663 --> 53:55.703
You really think
you're going to be able

53:55.732 --> 53:56.872
{\an1}to raise $20 million?

53:56.900 --> 53:59.370
Well, Loic's people
will help us
negotiate it down.

53:59.402 --> 54:01.602
{\an1}I have been working
with the FBI already

54:01.637 --> 54:02.937
{\an1}-to help negotiate it down.
-No. No.

54:02.973 --> 54:04.873
{\an1}I told you, those fuckers
are just trying to...

54:04.908 --> 54:08.208
{\an1}-I don't want to hear it.
-Can we keep this civil
please, Sam?

54:08.244 --> 54:10.314
{\an1}Leo's not-for-profit account
is still open.

54:10.346 --> 54:11.646
{\an1}We can wire the money
from there.

54:11.681 --> 54:13.321
No, we can't.

54:13.350 --> 54:15.720
My contact at
<i> The Wall Street Journal</i>
just told me

54:15.751 --> 54:18.151
{\an1}the Feds set up a whole new
set of SWIFT protocols

54:18.187 --> 54:20.887
{\an1}to try to crack down
on money laundering
to terrorists.

54:20.923 --> 54:23.763
{\an1}Not-for-profits are
specifically being monitored.

54:23.793 --> 54:26.433
{\an1}Apparently, there is a way
around it.

54:26.462 --> 54:28.502
It's sketchy,
but it is invisible.

54:28.531 --> 54:30.031
{\an1}By sketchy,
you mean illegal?

54:30.065 --> 54:32.635
{\an1}-Sheila: Helen, you know...
-The less you know the better.

54:33.903 --> 54:37.313
{\an1}Helen, I promised you
we will keep you protected.

54:38.375 --> 54:40.175
Charlotte:
<i> They're not geniuses,</i>

54:40.209 --> 54:42.879
and they're not saints.
They're just people.
Like you and me.

54:42.912 --> 54:44.352
{\an1}Like you, you mean.

54:47.416 --> 54:49.386
{\an1}What am I supposed
to say to them?

54:50.153 --> 54:51.453
Well, there isn't
a script.

54:51.487 --> 54:52.857
{\an1}You'll need to improvize.

54:52.889 --> 54:55.689
{\an1}Maybe I should have
taken elocution lessons.

55:01.297 --> 55:03.867
{\an1}So what did you say to them
when Leo was taken?

55:05.601 --> 55:08.771
I told them they were
part of an elite group
of people

55:08.805 --> 55:09.735
I had chosen.

55:09.772 --> 55:13.242
<i> That their actions now
would be anonymous,</i>

55:13.276 --> 55:15.846
{\an1}<i> but that history would
make them heroes.</i>

55:15.878 --> 55:17.648
( soft music playing )

55:19.782 --> 55:21.992
{\an1}Charlotte tells me
you're from upstate.

55:22.952 --> 55:24.352
Oneonta.

55:24.386 --> 55:26.686
My son went to Cornell.

55:26.723 --> 55:28.063
Great school.

55:28.091 --> 55:29.391
{\an1}It's no Harvard,

55:29.425 --> 55:31.695
but he's done well
enough for himself.

55:32.561 --> 55:34.161
Will: Did you keep Andy local,

55:34.196 --> 55:36.266
send him to Cornell as well?

55:36.299 --> 55:39.039
No, Wayne State
on a scholarship.

55:39.068 --> 55:40.438
Ah.

55:40.469 --> 55:42.099
{\an1}David's son
is also a journalist.

55:42.138 --> 55:43.368
Oh.

55:43.406 --> 55:46.606
{\an1}He's the Metro Editor
for the <i> Washington Post.</i>

55:46.643 --> 55:48.383
Oh. Nice.

55:49.478 --> 55:52.648
{\an1}Will: So, is Leo
enjoying Stanford?

55:52.682 --> 55:54.682
{\an1}Charlotte:
He loves teaching.
Chris was just out

55:54.717 --> 55:57.287
to see him deliver a lecture
for the Knight Fellowship.

55:57.320 --> 55:58.660
{\an1}Will: Give them both
our regards.

56:01.224 --> 56:04.734
{\an1}So, you ready to put
the squeeze on?

56:07.863 --> 56:08.933
( clears throat )

56:11.401 --> 56:14.141
My son Andy is a journalist.

56:15.138 --> 56:16.768
Well, you know that.

56:17.707 --> 56:18.707
And, uh...

56:20.310 --> 56:23.910
Right now, he's, uh,
in a serious situation.

56:23.946 --> 56:26.216
{\an1}I would be in San Francisco
myself right now

56:26.248 --> 56:27.478
if it wasn't very serious.

56:27.517 --> 56:28.817
{\an1}Right, it's very serious.

56:28.851 --> 56:30.551
{\an1}I sent you the link
to Andy's work.

56:30.586 --> 56:32.086
{\an1}You've seen
his videos, yes?

56:32.121 --> 56:33.561
{\an1}Incredible stuff.

56:34.624 --> 56:36.494
{\an1}There are only
a handful of people

56:36.525 --> 56:39.055
{\an1}doing the kind of work
that Andy is doing

56:39.095 --> 56:40.625
in the world.

56:40.663 --> 56:43.403
{\an1}But he is unaffiliated,

56:43.433 --> 56:44.573
{\an1}right, Helen?

56:44.600 --> 56:46.770
{\an1}He doesn't work for
a major news organization.

56:46.802 --> 56:48.442
Well, they don't go in there.

56:48.471 --> 56:50.771
Maybe that's for
a good reason.

56:51.975 --> 56:53.705
{\an1}Charlotte: Well,
when we approached you
for help with Leo,

56:53.742 --> 56:56.112
{\an1}your commitment
to journalism was total.

56:57.313 --> 57:00.123
{\an1}You and Chris are
our friends, Charlotte.

57:00.149 --> 57:01.989
And Helen is our friend.

57:02.018 --> 57:04.348
{\an1}Chris and I have committed
to a 100,000 each

57:04.386 --> 57:05.916
to secure Andy's release.

57:10.059 --> 57:12.299
{\an1}In order to have the right
to have an opinion,

57:12.328 --> 57:14.828
{\an1}I need people like
Andy and Leo

57:14.864 --> 57:18.404
{\an1}over there,
to inform me what
is actually happening

57:18.434 --> 57:20.944
{\an1}in the most dangerous
places in the world.

57:22.071 --> 57:23.441
{\an1}( David clears throat )

57:25.441 --> 57:27.041
Who else is involved?

57:28.511 --> 57:30.251
Well, Helen has been
very discreet.

57:30.279 --> 57:31.479
{\an1}You are the first.

57:35.384 --> 57:37.824
{\an1}I can commit to 25.

57:44.426 --> 57:45.626
{\an1}Twenty-five.

57:48.398 --> 57:51.198
{\an1}Fifty. All right,
let's call that a start.

57:51.234 --> 57:52.844
Thank you.

57:52.869 --> 57:55.439
{\an1}The Feds have set up
a whole new set
of SWIFT protocols,

57:55.471 --> 57:58.311
{\an1}so we will not be using
the nonprofit this time.

57:58.341 --> 57:59.541
On Monday,
you'll get an invoice

57:59.575 --> 58:01.505
from Dudek,
Roley, and Esser.

58:01.544 --> 58:04.384
{\an1}A retainer. Good idea.

58:04.413 --> 58:08.023
{\an1}So are you and Chris
going to be spending time
in Aspen this season?

58:08.050 --> 58:10.050
{\an1}Charlotte:
Well, that was
originally the plan.

58:10.085 --> 58:12.655
{\an1}But as it turns out,
Leo has a whole
set of lectures...

58:12.688 --> 58:14.418
{\an1}-David: A-ha!
-...during that time.

58:14.457 --> 58:16.657
{\an1}So I would very much like
to be there for that.

58:16.692 --> 58:18.632
{\an1}David: Yes, he's such
a busy man.

58:18.661 --> 58:20.461
-( Charlotte laughs )
-Excuse me, gentlemen.

58:20.496 --> 58:23.196
I have to catch my bus.

58:24.100 --> 58:25.100
Thank you.

58:29.071 --> 58:30.241
Excuse me.

58:32.341 --> 58:34.241
-( horns blaring )
-( siren wailing )

58:41.784 --> 58:44.454
Well, it wasn't as much
as we expected,

58:44.487 --> 58:45.987
but it's a good start.

58:48.924 --> 58:51.734
{\an1}I hate myself for being
so angry with Andy

58:51.761 --> 58:53.501
for putting us all
through this,

58:53.529 --> 58:55.499
{\an1}but I just can't help it.
I'm sorry,

58:55.531 --> 58:57.571
{\an1}but I'm furious.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.970
{\an1}Begging strangers
for money.

59:00.436 --> 59:02.036
It's just...

59:03.572 --> 59:05.142
It's not who I am.

59:08.978 --> 59:13.648
It was about six months
after Leo got home.

59:13.683 --> 59:15.823
{\an1}In the middle of the night,
Chris's phone rang.

59:15.852 --> 59:17.522
{\an1}I used to be able
to sleep through anything

59:17.553 --> 59:19.293
but ever since
Leo was taken...

59:21.524 --> 59:24.334
{\an1}So I was up,
so I went into Leo's room,

59:24.360 --> 59:26.460
{\an1}sat on the end of his bed

59:26.496 --> 59:28.356
{\an1}like I used to do
when he was a little boy,

59:28.398 --> 59:29.568
and I reached over,

59:29.598 --> 59:31.028
and he was gone.

59:32.134 --> 59:33.674
I panicked.

59:33.703 --> 59:36.813
{\an1}I ran through the house
turning on all the lights.

59:36.839 --> 59:38.639
{\an1}I ran back into his room,

59:38.674 --> 59:41.214
turned on the light,
and I saw that
his window was open.

59:42.945 --> 59:44.975
So I ran outside
to the backyard,

59:45.014 --> 59:46.224
and there he was.

59:46.248 --> 59:49.288
He was sound asleep
on the frozen ground.

59:51.220 --> 59:53.660
I looked at him for a minute.

59:53.689 --> 59:55.759
I went back inside.
I made some coffee.

59:55.791 --> 59:57.591
Cooked some eggs.

59:58.661 --> 01:00:00.031
( sighs ) You just carry on.

01:00:01.163 --> 01:00:02.633
Making believe.

01:00:02.664 --> 01:00:05.074
Make believe that
everything's all right.

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:08.299
{\an1}It's what mothers do.

01:00:16.078 --> 01:00:18.578
{\an1}<i> "He pushed his boat
into the water</i>

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:20.484
{\an1}and pulled himself
onto the deck.

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:22.586
{\an1}For the first time,
Prince Henry

01:00:22.618 --> 01:00:24.888
was headed into
the open sea."

{\an1}( sniffles )

01:00:36.732 --> 01:00:38.432
{\an1}"Prince Henry took a ladle
from his bucket

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:42.568
{\an1}and filled the Salt King's
stone chalice."

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:45.435
-Amy: Hi.
-Amy.

01:00:45.474 --> 01:00:47.314
How was she last night?

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:49.013
{\an1}Well, there hasn't been

01:00:49.044 --> 01:00:50.514
any change
for a long time.

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:51.976
That's good, right?

01:00:56.385 --> 01:00:57.845
You want me to be
honest with you?

01:00:58.687 --> 01:01:00.357
Yeah, I wish
somebody would be.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.734
You can, um...

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:06.059
You can keep her ventilated
for as long as you want.

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:13.167
You don't think that
she's going to make it?

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:16.271
Okay.

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:19.337
When, um...

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:22.376
You and Joey
and Kayla came in,

01:01:22.411 --> 01:01:24.581
we knew right away
that Joey wasn't
going to make it.

01:01:24.613 --> 01:01:27.223
{\an1}And I tried
to convince his parents

01:01:27.249 --> 01:01:29.189
to donate his organs,

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:30.748
which seems

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:33.057
really cold, but,

01:01:34.656 --> 01:01:36.826
I've had to watch
a lot of kids die,

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.189
some of them...

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:40.995
Some of them
can't be helped.

01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:43.429
{\an1}But there are other times
they die because

01:01:43.465 --> 01:01:46.795
they need a lung
or a kidney...

01:01:46.835 --> 01:01:49.805
So you want me
to donate her organs?

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.569
{\an1}-You want me to unplug her?
-No.

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:54.037
You don't...
I'm not saying that.

01:01:54.076 --> 01:01:56.876
You don't...
You can keep her
on the ventilator

01:01:56.912 --> 01:01:59.022
for as long as you want.

01:02:00.215 --> 01:02:02.215
All I'm saying is,

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:04.751
what happened to you
and Joey and Kayla

01:02:05.454 --> 01:02:06.964
was meaningless.

01:02:07.956 --> 01:02:09.686
It didn't happen for a reason,

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:10.985
{\an1}it didn't happen because
it was God's plan,

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:12.627
{\an1}or because it happened
for the best.

01:02:12.661 --> 01:02:14.861
It was just stupid,

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:16.965
and senseless.

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:20.395
But...

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:25.506
When you're dealt
a shitty hand,

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.080
what you do with it

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.050
doesn't have to be.

appreciates that.</i>

is terrible.</i>

01:05:43.906 --> 01:05:47.236
I understand,
but I didn't hear.
How is he?

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:49.883
<i>He was the strongest man.</i>

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:51.612
-Was? "Was"?
<i> -Is.</i>

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:52.877
<i> Is.</i>

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:55.945

I ever meet.</i>

<i> -Hopeless.</i>
-Is he hurt?

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.160
{\an1}<i> I have to say yes</i>

01:06:07.662 --> 01:06:09.002
{\an1}<i> and no to that.</i>

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:11.696
{\an1}<i> We are beaten.</i>

01:06:12.567 --> 01:06:15.337
{\an1}<i>Andy does not break.</i>

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:17.310
{\an1}<i> Ever.</i>

01:06:17.339 --> 01:06:20.379
{\an1}<i>Never complain,
never show fear.</i>

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:22.607
{\an1}<i>Always hope.</i>

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:27.246

Were you in the same
cell together?

<i> They move us.</i>

01:06:36.558 --> 01:06:38.458
{\an1}<i>But, um...</i>

01:06:38.493 --> 01:06:41.303
{\an1}<i> Always the foreigners
are in one room,</i>

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:43.670
{\an1}<i> and the Arabs
in other rooms.</i>

01:06:45.234 --> 01:06:47.174
{\an1}<i>Much better for us
in a way because...</i>

{\an1}( breathes heavily )

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:52.475
{\an1}<i>They have no limits
with the Arabic prisoners.</i>

01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:57.445
{\an1}<i>With us they kick,
they punch,</i>

01:06:59.214 --> 01:07:00.824
<i>but there's no clamp with us,</i>

01:07:00.849 --> 01:07:03.419
{\an1}<i>no car battery...</i>

01:07:07.422 --> 01:07:10.062
{\an1}<i>It is a kind of torture
to listen to torture.</i>

{\an1}( breathing heavily )

01:07:12.861 --> 01:07:14.201
{\an1}<i>But Andy</i>

01:07:14.763 --> 01:07:16.273
{\an1}<i>is always reminding us</i>

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.467
{\an1}<i>we are protected more,</i>

01:07:19.501 --> 01:07:22.641
{\an1}<i>we have value,
because we are foreigners.</i>

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.740
Well, Andy's gift
has always been

01:07:26.775 --> 01:07:29.745
{\an1}to be able to see
the bright spot
in the crappiest situation.

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:34.047
{\an1}<i>Andy never loses hope,
Helen.</i>

01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:36.119
{\an1}<i>Every day,</i>

01:07:37.552 --> 01:07:38.992
{\an1}<i>he kneels</i>

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.060
{\an1}<i>and says a little
morning prayer,</i>

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.090
{\an1}<i>quiet to himself.</i>

01:07:43.992 --> 01:07:45.292
<i>Then he rolls the bed up,</i>

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:47.595
{\an1}<i>makes a space to sit,</i>

01:07:48.563 --> 01:07:50.673
{\an1}<i>very clean and tidy.</i>

01:07:51.633 --> 01:07:55.273
{\an1}<i>While the rest of us,
we just leave the mats.</i>

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.811
{\an1}<i>But Andy</i>

01:07:57.839 --> 01:07:59.809
<i>starts the morning like this,</i>

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:03.012
{\an1}<i>every morning
since he arrived.</i>

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:06.515
{\an1}<i>So eventually, we all
start folding the mats, too.</i>

01:08:09.384 --> 01:08:10.924
Well, that must have
started over there,

01:08:10.952 --> 01:08:14.662
because you should
see the way
his room looks at home.

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.359
( both laugh )

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:19.060
That's what I'm going to do.
As soon as I get him back,

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:21.304
I'm going to make him
clean up all his shit.

01:08:22.096 --> 01:08:23.966
{\an1}<i>You will see him
again, Helen.</i>

01:08:23.999 --> 01:08:25.999
{\an1}<i>He is going to make it.</i>

01:08:26.033 --> 01:08:27.974
{\an1}<i>They paid the money
to release me</i>

01:08:28.002 --> 01:08:29.313
{\an1}<i>and Andy</i>

01:08:30.104 --> 01:08:31.835
{\an1}<i>is worth 100
of me.</i>

01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:36.609
( choir singing )

01:10:37.899 --> 01:10:39.669
{\an1}Eric: Hey.
What can I get you?

01:10:39.701 --> 01:10:40.841
I'm fine.

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:42.069
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm good.

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:43.414
{\an1}Oh.

01:10:43.438 --> 01:10:46.278
{\an1}So, congratulations.

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:48.439
{\an1}On the proof of life.

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:50.614
That was days ago.

01:10:50.645 --> 01:10:53.245
{\an1}Andy is alive.
There's still hope.

01:10:53.281 --> 01:10:55.521
{\an1}Can I ask you something?
A-L-M.

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:57.920
{\an1}Your proof of
life question.

01:10:57.952 --> 01:10:59.152
{\an1}What was carved
into the tree.

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:00.958
{\an1}What does A-L-M
stand for?

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:03.727
Greta Remelli.

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:05.629
Vanessa Marzullo.
Do you know them?

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:07.500
{\an1}-I...
-Or Nicholas Henin.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:10.369
Pierre Torres.
Edouard Elias.

01:11:10.865 --> 01:11:11.995
Loic Dejan.

01:11:12.934 --> 01:11:14.144
Are they friends
of Andy's?

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:16.469
No. They're hostages.

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:18.865
They were hostages.
They're home now.

01:11:20.308 --> 01:11:21.908
You know
why they're home.

01:11:21.943 --> 01:11:23.183
I know why they're home.

01:11:23.211 --> 01:11:24.881
They're home because
their governments...

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:27.583
{\an1}-Helen, we've talked...
-Do not interrupt me, please.

01:11:29.484 --> 01:11:32.524
{\an1}They're home because
their governments
paid the ransom.

01:11:34.689 --> 01:11:36.459
Did you think if we met
outside the office

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:38.562
{\an1}I'd have something different
to tell you about this?

01:11:38.593 --> 01:11:41.533
{\an1}Will you talk to me
like a human being
for once, Eric?

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:42.833
{\an1}Helen,

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:45.325
{\an1}you know what happens
once we pay out
one ransom?

01:11:45.366 --> 01:11:46.896
We create a market.

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:50.405
American lives gain
a very public
monetary value,

01:11:50.438 --> 01:11:52.708
{\an1}and that value
increases over time.

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:54.481
It stops
becoming political.

01:11:54.509 --> 01:11:57.409
It starts becoming
a business.

01:11:57.445 --> 01:12:00.475
{\an1}These guys call themselves
the Islamic State

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:01.516
{\an1}or the New Caliphate,

01:12:01.549 --> 01:12:03.649
{\an1}or whatever name will
sound badass

01:12:03.685 --> 01:12:06.115
{\an1}to some angry 16-year-old
on Twitter.

01:12:06.154 --> 01:12:07.224
{\an1}But they're really
just the mafia.

01:12:07.255 --> 01:12:08.915
But the French pay.

01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:10.557
The Italians pay.

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:14.234
Not a single
European government

01:12:14.262 --> 01:12:15.662
has admitted
to paying a ransom

01:12:15.697 --> 01:12:17.127
to a terrorist
organization.

01:12:17.165 --> 01:12:19.665
{\an1}Well, they don't shout it
from the rooftops,
but they pay

01:12:19.701 --> 01:12:21.671
{\an1}and you know
damn well they pay.

01:12:21.703 --> 01:12:25.043
{\an1}I don't.
I don't know who's been
telling you that,

01:12:25.073 --> 01:12:27.843
but I have no idea
how they got them
out of there.

01:12:31.112 --> 01:12:32.112
Right.

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:39.446
{\an1}Payment made to
a terrorist organization

01:12:39.487 --> 01:12:41.717
is illegal. I need
to reiterate that.

01:12:41.756 --> 01:12:44.686
{\an1}Do you think that
at this point in my life,

01:12:44.726 --> 01:12:47.556
{\an1}I'm afraid
of a jail sentence?

01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:49.396
Not just you, Helen.

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:51.201
Anyone and everyone

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:53.603
who assists you
in any way.

01:12:54.402 --> 01:12:55.842
{\an1}You'll send them
to jail, too.

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:07.147
( Reza exhales sharply )

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:16.562
Do you send
any of your paycheck
home to Iran?

01:13:19.694 --> 01:13:23.234
{\an1}No. It's difficult
with the sanctions.

01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:24.465
{\an3}Oh.

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.713
{\an1}Is Christmas important
in your family?

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:36.406
Was when my kid was little.

01:13:40.081 --> 01:13:41.421
Do you have kids?

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:43.987
( laughs ) No.

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:45.419
No. But seven sisters.

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:46.764
-Oh, God.
-( both laugh )

01:13:46.788 --> 01:13:49.928
Oh, that explains
so much.

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.097
( both chuckle )

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:56.059
Ah. You know,

01:13:56.564 --> 01:13:58.004
I miss the noise,

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:00.074
the gatherings,

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:01.996
the food. Oh!

01:14:05.306 --> 01:14:09.136
{\an1}You know the hardest thing
to get used to,
coming to America,

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:11.812
is the silence.

01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:15.946
Hmm.

01:14:18.653 --> 01:14:20.023
You must miss your son.

01:14:23.758 --> 01:14:24.758
I do.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.530
He's a journalist, right?

01:14:27.929 --> 01:14:29.059
Yes, he is.

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:31.228
Where is he now?

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:37.044
To be honest,
I don't know.

01:14:48.216 --> 01:14:50.546
{\an1}Ooh, ooh. That's a boy.

01:14:50.585 --> 01:14:52.685
Let's hear that breath now.

01:14:53.588 --> 01:14:55.918
{\an1}Okay, take it easy.

01:14:55.957 --> 01:14:57.187
{\an1}Take it easy.

01:14:58.427 --> 01:15:00.097
{\an1}Okay, that sounded better.

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:02.859

01:15:02.897 --> 01:15:06.637

right to the breaking news.</i>

{\an1}Good morning, Kayla.

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:20.073
Today is December 26th.

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:21.138

{\an8}It's part of the test.

01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:31.050
{\an1}I've been
talking to her all night.

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:34.256
I know, sweetie.
But you know how
the routine goes.

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:35.989
We have to follow protocol.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.226
{\an1}You're hurting her.

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:47.771

can you hear me?

01:17:54.536 --> 01:17:56.336
{\an1}saying that they're going
to get revenge,

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:57.741
{\an1}set an example,
or whatever.

01:17:57.772 --> 01:17:59.412
There have been
images, Helen.

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:00.911
It's bad.

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:04.782
{\an1}I've been there for a while
and these posts
are very, very ugly.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.320
What kind of posts?

01:18:07.348 --> 01:18:08.378
You don't want to know.

01:18:08.416 --> 01:18:09.776
{\an1}Helen, we have to
make a video.

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:12.248
{\an1}You need to go public,
and we need to do it now.

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:13.687
What is a video going to do?

01:18:13.721 --> 01:18:15.291
We need publicity,

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:16.193
we need money,

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:18.094
and we need to buy
a little more time.

01:18:18.126 --> 01:18:20.326
Sheila: We're going to be
going very wide with this,

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:24.032
{\an1}but we're going to do it
in a way that lets us
control the narrative.

01:18:24.065 --> 01:18:25.625
{\an1}Our friends
are all journalists,

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:27.437
{\an1}they know how to
make a story trend.

01:18:27.468 --> 01:18:29.298
{\an1}I promise you,

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:30.807
they'll tell it our way.

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:35.809
Okay.

01:18:36.744 --> 01:18:38.154
( cell phone chimes )

01:18:39.314 --> 01:18:40.724
-Oh, thank you.
-Here.

01:18:43.784 --> 01:18:44.824
I'm ready when you are.

01:18:44.852 --> 01:18:46.822
{\an1}Do you think I should
cover my hair?

01:18:46.854 --> 01:18:48.894
{\an1}I don't think
it's going to make
a difference to them,

01:18:48.923 --> 01:18:51.463
{\an1}and it's probably just
going to alienate
people over here.

01:18:51.492 --> 01:18:52.562
Okay.

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:54.264
{\an1}Now? You ready?

01:18:54.295 --> 01:18:57.895
{\an1}"I'm not supposed to be
saying this to you.
But I have money for you.

01:18:57.932 --> 01:19:02.142
{\an1}"I'm in the process
of transferring everything
I have in the world..."

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:04.410
{\an1}Oh, wait a minute,
everything in the world
to you.

01:19:04.438 --> 01:19:05.808
Sheila:
Oh, you're fine.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.010
-I'm sorry.
-Just...

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.612
{\an8}You know what,
the eye line
is off anyway.

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:11.183
{\an8}We need to put these
right under. Can I see
what that looks like?

01:19:12.313 --> 01:19:15.023
{\an1}"I'm not supposed to be
saying this to you.

01:19:15.049 --> 01:19:18.749
{\an1}"I have money for you.
I'm in the process
of tran"sferring to you

01:19:18.787 --> 01:19:20.887
{\an1}"everything I have
in the world.

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:22.492
{\an1}"I'm begging you."

01:19:23.991 --> 01:19:25.731
Sheila:
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.030
I hate on-camera work,
too, it's the worst.

01:19:28.062 --> 01:19:29.632
Oh, this is not
going to work.

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:31.034
This isn't going to work.

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:34.237
{\an7}Do you need to read it?

01:19:36.704 --> 01:19:37.914
You mean memorize it?

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:40.139
No, I mean,
it doesn't need
to be perfect.

01:19:40.875 --> 01:19:42.375
It just needs to be you.

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:45.905
Okay, give it to me.
Let me look at it.

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:47.447
{\an1}Can I move?
I'm not comfortable here.

01:19:47.481 --> 01:19:49.451
Sam: Yeah, you can go
wherever you want.
Sheila: Yeah, yeah.

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:53.423
{\an1}( Sam clears throat )

01:19:53.454 --> 01:19:55.094
( reads softly )

01:19:55.122 --> 01:19:57.432
-( Sam clears throat )
-Sheila: How's that?

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.029
{\an1}Yeah, let's see.

01:20:03.564 --> 01:20:05.174
{\an1}-Okay.
-( whispers ) Yeah.

01:20:06.668 --> 01:20:09.038
{\an1}My name is Helen Sterling.

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:12.840
My son Andrew Sterling
is a journalist.

01:20:12.873 --> 01:20:15.183
{\an1}I'm not supposed
to be saying this to you,

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:17.810
{\an1}but I have money for you.

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:20.947
I'm begging you.

01:20:22.516 --> 01:20:23.546
<i> Please,</i>

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:26.962
<i> don't hurt my son.</i>

01:20:28.623 --> 01:20:29.863
{\an3}You...

01:20:31.792 --> 01:20:34.362
You say that
you want millions.

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.525
I'm no one.

01:20:39.667 --> 01:20:41.167
I'm an old lady.

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:45.873
I'm a mother,

01:20:45.906 --> 01:20:47.536
just like your mothers.

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:54.116
I am going to give you

01:20:54.815 --> 01:20:56.575
every penny

01:20:56.617 --> 01:20:58.587
that I can get my hands on.

01:21:00.254 --> 01:21:03.534
I'm not even asking you
to release him.

01:21:04.659 --> 01:21:05.859
Just

01:21:06.894 --> 01:21:08.264
don't hurt him.

01:21:10.698 --> 01:21:11.898
Please.

01:21:12.566 --> 01:21:14.136
Don't hurt my boy.

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:20.977
{\an1}-Okay.
-( camera beeps )

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:22.579
{\an1}-I think we got it.
-Sheila: Yeah.

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:25.575
{\an1}That was great.
That was perfect.

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:29.846
Thank you.

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:31.854
-( sighs )
Thank you, guys.
-Yeah.

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:33.086
It was great.

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:37.427
( cell phone chimes )

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.431
( exhales )

01:21:47.935 --> 01:21:49.365
( cell phone chiming )

01:22:10.658 --> 01:22:12.388
( cell phone chimes )

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:19.301
{\an1}( cell phone
chiming repeatedly )

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.348
{\an1}Helen, sorry.

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:34.447
{\an1}Sorry to bug you.

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.017
{\an1}The video is up.

01:22:42.156 --> 01:22:43.726
I was dreaming
about Andy.

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.197
{\an1}I dream about him
all the time.

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:53.429
{\an1}Come out back.
It's been snowing.

01:22:53.467 --> 01:22:55.037
<i> It's so pretty.</i>

01:23:01.742 --> 01:23:03.112
Thanks.

01:23:05.846 --> 01:23:07.276
( lighter clicking )

01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:13.461
CNN, Al Jazeera, and BBC
have all picked it up.

01:23:16.957 --> 01:23:19.427
{\an1}Can you guys explain
something to me?

01:23:19.461 --> 01:23:21.531
{\an1}You know Andy
better than I do.

01:23:21.562 --> 01:23:22.402
Come on, Helen.

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:24.370
No, you do.
Both of you do.

01:23:24.399 --> 01:23:27.669
'Cause you know
who Andy is now.

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:31.537
People don't change
as much as
they think they do.

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.440
{\an1}I don't know.
I mean,

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:38.380
Andy always hated war.

01:23:38.412 --> 01:23:40.982
{\an1}Violence of any kind,
he was super-sensitive to it,

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:42.845
{\an1}from the time
he was a little kid.

01:23:42.883 --> 01:23:45.553
You know, when
the first Gulf War...

01:23:47.054 --> 01:23:48.594
He got sent home
from school

01:23:48.622 --> 01:23:49.922
because he organized

01:23:49.957 --> 01:23:52.027
a pacifist sit-in.

01:23:52.059 --> 01:23:53.859
{\an1}( chuckles )
He told me about that

01:23:53.895 --> 01:23:56.495
{\an1}when he found out
my family was from Iraq.

01:23:56.530 --> 01:23:58.730
{\an1}I thought he was lying
just to sleep with me.

01:23:58.766 --> 01:24:00.466
Well, it worked,
didn't it?

01:24:00.501 --> 01:24:01.701
( both chuckle )

01:24:01.735 --> 01:24:03.195
No, he wasn't lying.

01:24:03.237 --> 01:24:05.967
He organized
a pacifist sit-in

01:24:06.006 --> 01:24:08.276
-of one.
-( all chuckle )

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.180
The Andy I know

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:18.120
wouldn't willingly
go off to war.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.120
But your Andy, he went.

01:24:22.256 --> 01:24:25.056
And went back
again and again.
Had to go back.

01:24:27.261 --> 01:24:30.031
That Andy
is a stranger to me.

01:24:30.064 --> 01:24:32.004
I don't know about that.

01:24:32.033 --> 01:24:34.973
{\an1}He was still a bright-eyed
pinko pacifist

01:24:35.002 --> 01:24:36.572
the last time I checked.

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:41.442
He's just doing
something different
with his idealism now.

01:24:47.748 --> 01:24:49.078
{\an3}Okay.

01:24:49.717 --> 01:24:52.087
{\an1}That is enough
of that shit.

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.187
{\an1}( grunts )

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:55.892
Helen: Hell, no.

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.234
{\an1}Sheila: What?
Sam: You wanna go?

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:59.488
{\an1}-Sheila: Yeah. This is war!
-You wanna fuckin' go?

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:01.357
( laughs )

01:25:02.396 --> 01:25:04.326
Sheila: One!
Sam: Oh!

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:06.896
{\an1}Sheila: Wait for it.
Wait for it!

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:08.895
-Oh!
-Yeah!

01:25:08.936 --> 01:25:09.996
That was right
on my dick!

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:11.468
Two on one, huh?

01:25:12.406 --> 01:25:13.406
Oh!

01:25:14.108 --> 01:25:15.438
I got you!

01:25:16.811 --> 01:25:18.381
( groans )

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:19.653
{\an1}A-ha!

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.180
{\an1}Get you!

01:25:21.216 --> 01:25:23.146
My hearing aid!
My hearing aid!

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:24.924
Stop, stop! I can't find
the other one.

01:25:24.952 --> 01:25:27.292
{\an1}-Helen: All right,
all right, all right.
-I think it's right...

01:25:27.321 --> 01:25:28.591
{\an1}-It's right here!
-Sheila: Oh!

01:25:28.623 --> 01:25:30.363
Right here.
Right fucking here.

01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:32.761
{\an1}-Helen: You fight dirty.
-I play to win!

01:25:32.793 --> 01:25:33.833
{\an3}Yeah!

01:25:33.861 --> 01:25:35.161
Ah!

01:25:35.529 --> 01:25:37.499
( panting )

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:40.103
{\an1}-Oh, look out!
-( Helen screams )

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:41.674
Help, help, help!

01:25:41.702 --> 01:25:42.702
Sheila: Put her down!

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:47.843
( all laughing )

{\an1}-Oh, Helen. I'm so...
-Dr. Rahimi,

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.680
I think Dr. Hauser
needed you to assist.

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:26.413
Thanks, Helen.

01:26:28.649 --> 01:26:30.449
Good morning, Kayla.

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:34.286
You getting ready
to walk, huh?

01:26:34.322 --> 01:26:35.622
{\an1}Amy: Kayla,
you remember Helen.

01:26:36.123 --> 01:26:37.693
{\an1}We saw her on TV.

01:26:39.693 --> 01:26:41.633
How was your appetite
this morning?

01:26:42.029 --> 01:26:43.229
{\an3}Hmm?

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:45.498
{\an1}Clean plate club.

01:26:45.532 --> 01:26:46.372
Good work!

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.300
I'm just going to
take your pulse.

01:26:48.669 --> 01:26:50.969
{\an1}Hey, Kayla.

01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:52.135
Helen's got a lot of
other patients.

01:26:52.172 --> 01:26:53.312
{\an1}No, it's all right.
I'll come back.

01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:55.611
{\an1}Maybe after
she finishes her PT.

01:26:56.811 --> 01:26:57.851
Helen.

01:26:59.213 --> 01:27:01.283
I'm really sorry.
If there's anything...

01:27:01.315 --> 01:27:03.215
I'll be back in a jiffy.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.700
I should've told you.

01:27:23.504 --> 01:27:25.174
{\an1}Folks from Channel Two,
they were asking about you,

01:27:25.206 --> 01:27:26.836
{\an1}but I told them
you were off all week.

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:29.379
You didn't have to do that.

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:31.110
{\an1}Keesha: You've been
through enough.

01:27:31.145 --> 01:27:32.545
Thank you, Keesha.

01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:38.320
We're here
for you, Helen.

01:27:39.319 --> 01:27:41.359
Helen, whatever you need.

01:27:41.388 --> 01:27:42.718
{\an1}We've got your back.

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:19.933
( cell phone chiming )

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:22.061
Sam: ( in English )
And 50,000
from Loic's friends.

01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:23.526
Charlotte: Helen.

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:26.534
David and Will finally
came through.
$100,000 each.

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:28.667
( Sheila speaking Arabic )

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:30.670
( speaking Italian )

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:38.410
( in English )
Two hundred thousand
from the Italians.

01:28:38.445 --> 01:28:40.775
-Helen: Two hundred?
-( Sam speaks Arabic )

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:43.775
{\an1}( in English )
Sheila, what's the address
for the law office in Milan?

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:44.988
Helen,

01:28:45.018 --> 01:28:46.248
it's Tom Hellman.

01:28:46.287 --> 01:28:47.787
{\an1}Helen: Who?

01:28:47.821 --> 01:28:50.091
The owner of the Hawks.
He wants to speak
to you personally.

01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:54.761
Hello, this is Helen.

01:28:56.196 --> 01:28:57.766
Yes, Mr. Hellman.

01:28:58.299 --> 01:29:00.099
Oh, okay, Tom.

01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:06.011
{\an1}Well, that's very
generous of you, sir.

01:29:07.074 --> 01:29:08.114
Thank you so much.

01:29:09.242 --> 01:29:11.612
{\an1}Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:29:12.446 --> 01:29:13.646
( cell phone beeps )

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:21.824
He gave us $800,000.

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.986
{\an1}-( laughs )
-Sheila: Holy shit!

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:25.155
{\an1}( Charlotte clapping )

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:27.093
{\an1}-( doorbell rings )
-Oh, Helen.

01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:28.598
{\an1}Charlotte:
That must be the food.

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:30.499
( all chattering excitedly )

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:33.571
Charlotte: We still have
a lot more to do, but we're
on our way, everybody.

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.700
{\an1}-Sheila:
Just like that, $800,000.
-Yeah...

01:29:35.736 --> 01:29:37.466
{\an1}Okay. So we're at
two-and-a-half, I think.

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:39.705
Two-and-a-half?
All right if we get
to four today,

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.140
{\an1}-we're in good shape.
-Okay.

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:49.445
You want me to drive
for a while?

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:51.654
Why don't you get some sleep?

01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:57.861
We did it.

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:01.561
{\an1}We're getting there.

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.040
Sam: <i> I have a flight
tomorrow night.</i>

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:43.496
Helen:
<i> Where are you going?</i>

01:30:43.937 --> 01:30:45.537
<i> Istanbul.</i>

01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:48.383
{\an1}-Helen...
-I'm not allowing you
to use Andy as an excuse

01:30:48.409 --> 01:30:49.609
to kill yourself, sorry.

01:30:49.643 --> 01:30:51.053
That's not what I'm doing.

01:30:51.078 --> 01:30:52.178
Think of your father.

01:30:52.212 --> 01:30:54.352
Why don't you trust me?

01:30:54.381 --> 01:30:56.081
Why don't you
trust me?

01:30:56.784 --> 01:30:59.524
{\an1}You treat me like a child.

01:30:59.553 --> 01:31:01.423
Maybe I can't
understand everything,

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:02.655
but I'm not an idiot.

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:04.160
{\an1}All right, all right.

01:31:05.292 --> 01:31:06.362
{\an1}( sighs )

01:31:06.393 --> 01:31:08.063
This is obviously
just between us.

01:31:10.197 --> 01:31:12.997
We are hiding
in plain sight.

01:31:13.033 --> 01:31:16.843
{\an1}The money that we've
raised is going through
an international law firm

01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:19.370
{\an1}that Charlotte's
connected to.

01:31:19.406 --> 01:31:20.936
{\an1}Say, you want to donate
100 grand

01:31:20.974 --> 01:31:23.244
{\an1}to Andy's cause,
and you live in London.

01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:24.947
{\an1}You write a check
to their London office

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:28.519
{\an1}and you pay 100 grand
for legal services.

01:31:28.549 --> 01:31:31.519
{\an1}No one looks at law firms
for money laundering,

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:32.992
{\an1}and even if they did,
it'd be too late,

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.520
because the money
goes from there

01:31:34.554 --> 01:31:36.594
{\an1}to a dozen different
shell companies.

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:39.364
{\an1}British Virgin Islands,
Bahamas,

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:41.403
{\an1}places you can wire
large amounts of money

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:43.699
{\an1}to and from
without being detected.

01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:46.071
And then you wire that
to the Mid-East?

01:31:46.099 --> 01:31:47.999
{\an1}Mmm. Mostly Europe.

01:31:49.736 --> 01:31:51.706
There are 15
different banks

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:53.869
that the money
is being wired to,

01:31:53.907 --> 01:31:55.907
{\an1}and 15
private security guards

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:58.013
{\an1}who are going to drive it
to Istanbul.

01:31:58.044 --> 01:32:01.054
{\an1}Every single one
of these guys, I have met

01:32:01.882 --> 01:32:03.122
{\an1}and vetted.

01:32:04.251 --> 01:32:05.791
I want to bring Andy home.

01:32:07.421 --> 01:32:09.691
This time next week,

01:32:09.723 --> 01:32:11.133
{\an1}he will be sitting here.

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:17.273
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:32:18.198 --> 01:32:19.698
( whispers ) Okay.

01:32:22.403 --> 01:32:24.813
{\an1}( train horn blowing
in distance )

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:41.688
Hey.

01:32:59.439 --> 01:33:00.979
( chuckles )

01:33:04.311 --> 01:33:05.681
( fireworks exploding on TV )

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:18.691
( lively music playing )

01:33:18.725 --> 01:33:20.995
{\an1}No, no, no.
I get first dibs.

01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:23.258
{\an1}I trained him.

01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:24.927
Keesha: Okay, fine.

01:33:24.965 --> 01:33:28.495
You know, my last resident
gave me a Godiva Sampler

01:33:28.535 --> 01:33:29.995
when he finished his rotation.

01:33:31.171 --> 01:33:32.511
He was an underachiever.

01:33:32.539 --> 01:33:34.479
You really need
to open up a restaurant.

01:33:34.508 --> 01:33:37.238
{\an7}No, he does not.
We need Dr. Rahimi

01:33:37.277 --> 01:33:38.277
{\an7}right here.

01:33:39.646 --> 01:33:41.046
Reza: Thank you, Helen.

01:33:47.187 --> 01:33:49.117
( indistinct chatter )

01:33:58.032 --> 01:33:59.672
Of course.

01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:02.570
He can cook,
he's a doctor. Keesha...

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:04.673
{\an1}What are you waiting for?

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:06.465
{\an1}( laughing )

01:34:06.507 --> 01:34:07.937
You better call dibs.

01:34:10.877 --> 01:34:12.207
Here you go.
For the toast.

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:13.506
{\an7}Oh, for the toast.

01:34:13.547 --> 01:34:15.517
{\an1}The toast.

01:34:15.549 --> 01:34:16.949
{\an1}-Well...
-( knocking on table )

01:34:19.286 --> 01:34:21.156
To Kayla.

01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:23.692
Going home for the New Year.

01:34:23.724 --> 01:34:25.434
{\an1}To Kayla.
Miracles do happen.

01:34:25.459 --> 01:34:27.129
all: Kayla!

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.930
Um, I hope you guys
are praying for
a miracle tonight.

01:34:29.963 --> 01:34:32.633
{\an1}Two hours before
the annual bloodbath

01:34:32.666 --> 01:34:33.766
{\an1}begins anew.

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.000
Oh. Oh, you hear that?

01:34:35.035 --> 01:34:37.135
Come on, boss.
Put that down.

01:34:37.170 --> 01:34:40.010
One last dance before
the madness begins.

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:51.891
Right.

01:34:51.918 --> 01:34:53.288
Carmelyn: Let me...
Let me show you.

01:34:53.887 --> 01:34:55.457
( all exclaiming )

01:34:56.523 --> 01:34:57.863
Helen.

01:34:58.692 --> 01:35:00.702
{\an1}It's an honor
to be trained by you.

01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:06.229
My pleasure.

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.965
( inaudible )

01:35:57.551 --> 01:35:59.091
( Keesha whooping )

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.120
( Reza laughs )

01:36:00.154 --> 01:36:01.324
{\an1}Chef Reza!

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:02.855
{\an1}( laughs )

01:36:05.426 --> 01:36:06.856
Oh, guys, it's almost time.

01:36:06.893 --> 01:36:08.503
Five minutes before midnight.

01:36:08.528 --> 01:36:09.558
Let's go, lets go.

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:10.997
{\an1}There she is.

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:13.231
{\an1}-We're going to miss it.
-No, you know what?
Go ahead.

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:16.237
I gotta get the hats
and the horns.

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:17.840
{\an1}-That's what...
-Keesha: Hurry up!

01:36:17.871 --> 01:36:19.171
{\an1}I am, I am, I am.

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:20.436
{\an1}-Helen: Okay.
-( cell phone vibrating )

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:26.305
( blows raspberry )

01:36:31.351 --> 01:36:34.921
{\an1}So do you want
the big hat or the crown?

01:36:34.955 --> 01:36:37.315
Helen. Stay
a minute, please.

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.896
{\an1}-( cell phone vibrates )
-What's up?

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:44.296
{\an1}Don't go out there.

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:48.697
Just go sit down.
Please. Helen.

01:36:48.735 --> 01:36:50.065
Helen!

01:36:50.871 --> 01:36:52.311
{\an1}Keesha:
Helen, please!

01:37:33.847 --> 01:37:35.117
( gasps softly )

01:39:24.858 --> 01:39:26.688
Mom, look, I'm doing it!
