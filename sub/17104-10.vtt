00:02.839 --> 00:04.480
-Previously, on "Dance
Academy"--

00:04.519 --> 00:07.440
[sirens]

00:07.480 --> 00:09.480
MR. KENNEDY (OFFSCREEN): Proven
commitment to training

00:09.519 --> 00:12.320
for an elite career in dance
would be compelling evidence

00:12.359 --> 00:16.359
that Christian would benefit
from a non-custodial sentence.

00:16.399 --> 00:17.800
This could be your ticket
to freedom.

00:21.839 --> 00:22.839
-Sorry.

00:22.879 --> 00:24.320
-You wanna know why I'm
so mean to Tara?

00:24.359 --> 00:26.480
Because the three of you
are a bunch of idiots.

00:26.519 --> 00:28.519
-Abigail, you do know that for
your height and weight, you're

00:28.559 --> 00:30.399
in perfect proportion,
don't you?

00:30.440 --> 00:31.800
It's normal to be developing.

00:31.839 --> 00:33.520
-I am not developing.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.840
I'm certainly not most girls.

00:35.880 --> 00:36.600
KAT (OFFSCREEN): I have these.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.320
I have bigger these.

00:38.359 --> 00:41.119
-But I've got be a principal
dancer, and principals don't.

00:41.159 --> 00:42.399
They just don't.

00:42.439 --> 00:43.479
They're ethereal.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.079
They're like--

00:44.119 --> 00:45.399
-Who, Tara?

00:48.520 --> 00:50.200
[theme music]

01:01.640 --> 01:05.200
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

01:05.239 --> 01:08.599
Close your eyes.

01:08.640 --> 01:13.159
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.599
This is my chance.

01:18.640 --> 01:22.599
This is my chance-- my
chance to feel alive.

01:38.239 --> 01:40.040
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Out in the
bush, the best way to survive

01:40.079 --> 01:42.599
is to blend into your
surroundings.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.079
-Make it romantic.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.599
TARA (OFFSCREEN): I once watched
this lizard become

01:46.640 --> 01:49.799
exactly the same color as the
tree it was sitting on, until

01:49.840 --> 01:53.239
it was almost impossible to see,
which helps when there's

01:53.280 --> 01:55.239
a predator nearby.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.680
-Yes.

01:56.719 --> 02:00.319
Tara, Christian, that's not as
dreadful as I've seen it.

02:00.359 --> 02:01.799
TARA (OFFSCREEN): But another
time, it was too

02:01.840 --> 02:03.079
slow site to change.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.159
And as it stepped out into
the open, that's when

02:05.200 --> 02:06.159
the predator swooped.

02:06.200 --> 02:06.519
-Sorry.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.040
Sorry.

02:07.079 --> 02:08.080
Sorry.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.318
-I said like a gazelle,
not at elephant.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.479
Go to the back.

02:11.520 --> 02:14.479
I'm sick of the sight of you.

02:14.520 --> 02:15.759
Katrina, to the front
of the class.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.319
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Sometimes,
I think it'd be easier to

02:21.360 --> 02:25.400
survive in the bush than
at the academy.

02:25.439 --> 02:27.599
-Ms. Raine, I just wanted
to say that I

02:27.639 --> 02:29.400
see your point entirely.

02:29.439 --> 02:31.680
It's clear that I need
a new partner.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.199
-Is it?

02:33.240 --> 02:36.120
-I've taught Sammy all I can.

02:36.159 --> 02:37.319
I need someone who's
at my level.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.159
-Abigail, the problem
isn't just Sammy.

02:39.199 --> 02:41.039
He had to do all the work in the
lift because you're a sack

02:41.080 --> 02:43.479
of potatoes.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.400
-Me?

02:45.439 --> 02:46.479
Potatoes?

02:46.520 --> 02:47.719
-A dancer who blames
her partner isn't

02:47.759 --> 02:48.919
popular in a company.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.400
I suggest you assess your
own shortcomings.

02:53.479 --> 02:54.639
-Thank you.

03:37.240 --> 03:40.080
-And faille, assemble.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.280
Legs together in the assemble.

03:43.319 --> 03:44.039
Good.

03:44.080 --> 03:44.759
Make a picture in the air.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.120
And--

03:48.400 --> 03:49.639
that's it, Christian.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.240
Watch your placement.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.479
Good.

04:01.439 --> 04:02.599
Faille, assemble.

04:04.639 --> 04:05.400
Friend of yours, Christian?

04:05.439 --> 04:07.199
-Um, never seen him before.

04:13.240 --> 04:13.680
TEACHER (OFFSCREEN): OK.

04:13.719 --> 04:16.319
Keep going.

04:16.360 --> 04:16.720
AARON (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

04:16.759 --> 04:17.319
Yeah.

04:17.360 --> 04:17.839
Tonight.

04:17.879 --> 04:18.480
It's all sorted.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.839
I'm here right now.

04:19.879 --> 04:23.399
Oh, I'm just looking at a really
ugly chick, actually.

04:23.439 --> 04:25.439
Yeah, it's been unfortunate.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.800
You're right, mate.

04:26.839 --> 04:29.360
It must be hard going through
life looking like that.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.800
-Excuse me?

04:30.839 --> 04:34.480
-You know, listening to other
people's phone calls is

04:34.519 --> 04:34.839
creepy.

04:34.879 --> 04:35.560
-Yeah?

04:35.600 --> 04:37.160
So is loitering.

04:37.199 --> 04:37.720
Are you lost?

04:37.759 --> 04:38.560
-What?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.199
Don't you think I belong here?

04:40.240 --> 04:41.040
-Depends.

04:41.079 --> 04:42.759
Are you man enough for tights?

04:42.800 --> 04:45.160
-Actually, I've got a
formal invitation.

04:45.199 --> 04:46.360
I'm visiting my brother.

04:46.399 --> 04:46.839
-Yeah?

04:46.879 --> 04:47.439
Who's that?

04:47.480 --> 04:47.879
-Aaron.

04:47.920 --> 04:48.800
-Cheddar.

04:48.839 --> 04:50.199
-What are you doing here, man?

04:50.240 --> 04:51.240
-Not much.

04:51.279 --> 04:53.639
-Visiting you, apparently.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.160
Although you guys don't really
look like brothers.

04:55.199 --> 04:57.560
-Yeah, well, this guy-- he's
closer than a brother.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.000
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Oh.

04:59.040 --> 05:05.720
Well, Aaron, Cheddar, I'm
leaving you to your man love.

05:05.759 --> 05:08.360
-So what are you doing here?

05:08.399 --> 05:09.600
-Gran kicked me out.

05:09.639 --> 05:12.439
Said she's had a gutful
of me wasting my life.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.800
-Heard you've been hanging
out with the Longleys.

05:13.839 --> 05:15.279
Don't believe everything
your hear.

05:15.319 --> 05:16.480
-Dude, I thought you were
smarter than that.

05:16.519 --> 05:17.759
-Hey, hey, don't worry.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.639
I know what I'm doing.

05:20.680 --> 05:24.639
-So are you gonna let me sleep
on the streets or what?

05:24.680 --> 05:26.639
-I can lend you a
couple bucks.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.199
-This was my grandmother's.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.480
And you don't eve bother
telling me?

05:57.519 --> 06:00.319
-That whiny voice is seriously
unattractive.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.800
Just so you know.

06:01.839 --> 06:02.800
I'll replace it tomorrow.

06:02.839 --> 06:04.199
-You can't just replace it.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.560
It's all I have of hers.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.920
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): Well, what
do you want me to say?

06:06.959 --> 06:09.800
The ugly mirror's broken, which
is tragic, yes, but also

06:09.839 --> 06:11.279
irreversible.

06:11.319 --> 06:13.800
So aside from me writing an
apology in my own blood, all I

06:13.839 --> 06:16.199
can do is get you another one.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.519
-Well, I suppose.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.240
But just so you know, you can't
break something and

06:19.279 --> 06:20.279
pretend it never happened.

06:20.319 --> 06:21.199
It's common courtesy.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.399
-Shh.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.439
-So let me get this straight.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.399
They're actually forcing you
to wear girls' shoes?

06:37.439 --> 06:39.120
-It's just temporary.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.079
And they're not exclusively
girls' shoes.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.800
-Oh, they so are.

06:42.839 --> 06:44.120
-Guys do pointe.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.199
Character roles?

06:45.240 --> 06:47.120
-Like the ugly sisters
in "Cinderella?"

06:47.160 --> 06:48.199
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.600
-No way, dude.

06:49.639 --> 06:50.279
-What?

06:50.319 --> 06:51.519
-Lucy Gladewright.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.439
Dead ringer.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.759
-No, she's not.

06:53.800 --> 06:57.839
-This guy had the biggest crush
on Lucy Gladewright.

06:57.879 --> 06:58.480
-No.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.600
No, I didn't.

06:59.639 --> 07:00.279
-He was 10 years old
and he thought they

07:00.319 --> 07:01.519
were gonna get married.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.120
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Aw.

07:02.160 --> 07:02.519
-What?

07:02.560 --> 07:03.519
-Dude.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.279
Wait, are you-- are
you blushing?

07:05.319 --> 07:06.160
Aw.

07:06.199 --> 07:08.279
Man, I love this guy.

07:08.319 --> 07:09.800
You gonna get me some
food, then?

07:09.839 --> 07:10.319
-Sure.

07:10.360 --> 07:10.759
-Sweet.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.639
-Why not?

07:15.839 --> 07:17.319
-Uh, who's that?

07:17.360 --> 07:18.480
-He's a mate of mine.

07:18.519 --> 07:20.639
He's gonna be staying
here tonight.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.160
-How'd you get permission?

07:22.199 --> 07:24.600
-And, uh, who made
you hall monitor?

07:24.639 --> 07:25.839
Do you want a badge or a sash?

07:25.879 --> 07:28.120
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
sash is cool.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.360
Ready?

07:29.399 --> 07:30.600
Bang.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.720
-He's the funniest guy I know.

07:37.759 --> 07:38.360
-Christian?

07:38.399 --> 07:39.120
-Yeah.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.399
-Dude, he doesn't speak.

07:40.439 --> 07:42.199
-I've seen him smile
about twice.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.800
-Yeah, and one of those
was a grimace.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.319
-Trust me, all right?

07:45.360 --> 07:46.600
Actually, there's
a funny story.

07:46.639 --> 07:48.319
This one night, we got pulled
over by the cops.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.800
And he says, why are
you speeding?

07:49.839 --> 07:52.279
And Christian leans over from
the passenger seat and goes,

07:52.319 --> 07:53.680
uh, sorry mate.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.439
The servo we're about to rob
closes in five minutes.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.160
And the cop just laughed
and let us off.

07:58.199 --> 07:59.040
-Oh, no way.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.199
AARON (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.839
We're were only going
like five K's over.

08:01.879 --> 08:05.480
But the funny thing-- same cop
half an hour later picks us up

08:05.519 --> 08:06.680
for robbing the servo.

08:09.279 --> 08:10.600
-That didn't happen.

08:10.639 --> 08:11.279
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

08:11.319 --> 08:13.040
Why would you do that?

08:13.079 --> 08:13.480
-Guys.

08:13.519 --> 08:14.319
Come on.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.639
It's obvious that it's a joke.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.600
Right?

08:18.639 --> 08:20.600
-Why do you think he's here
in ballet school?

08:20.639 --> 08:22.279
He doesn't have a choice.

08:22.319 --> 08:23.720
-Christian robbed a
service station?

08:27.439 --> 08:30.639
-Um, it's getting late, so--

08:30.680 --> 08:31.199
-Yeah.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.240
No.

08:32.279 --> 08:32.759
We've got, um, homework
to do anyway.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.200
-What homework?

08:34.240 --> 08:35.200
-Uh, anatomy homework.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.399
-Let's go.

08:47.399 --> 08:48.720
-You hadn't told them.

08:48.759 --> 08:50.120
-No kidding.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.399
-I'm gonna get some air.

09:12.559 --> 09:13.360
Look, mate.

09:13.399 --> 09:14.360
You know I've got a big mouth.

09:14.399 --> 09:15.519
It's always getting
me into trouble.

09:15.559 --> 09:17.200
-I didn't tell them for
a reason, all right?

09:17.240 --> 09:18.519
-I thought they were
your friends.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.360
I mean, why would they care?

09:19.399 --> 09:21.039
-You don't get this place, OK?

09:21.080 --> 09:23.200
-It's only temporary, right?

09:23.240 --> 09:24.720
-Yeah, sure.

09:24.759 --> 09:26.399
-Good, because you know, once
this whole court thing's over,

09:26.440 --> 09:27.840
I can head straight
to Indonesia.

09:27.879 --> 09:28.720
Been talking about
it long enough.

09:28.759 --> 09:29.679
-Yeah.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.600
And what if we go
to jail, Aaron?

09:30.639 --> 09:32.320
-Why so negative?

09:32.360 --> 09:35.080
Couple months in ballet land,
quick hello to the judge, and

09:35.120 --> 09:36.600
then we're out of here.

09:36.639 --> 09:37.759
-Bo's got a mate with
a charter boat.

09:37.799 --> 09:40.039
-Oh, Bo Longley's got
a mate now, does he?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.559
-Yeah.

09:41.600 --> 09:46.159
We can cruise the islands and
surf all day, live the dream.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.759
-Gotta actually do it, Cheds.

10:54.840 --> 10:55.799
-What are you doing
there, mate?

10:55.840 --> 10:57.360
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

10:57.399 --> 10:59.360
-Didn't know if you could
get back in or not.

11:05.679 --> 11:07.480
-Are you hurt?

11:07.519 --> 11:09.559
-Stuck my board.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.240
-So where is it?

11:12.279 --> 11:13.639
The board?

11:13.679 --> 11:15.399
-Are you gonna get me
some ice or what?

11:33.320 --> 11:34.039
MS. RAINE (OFFSCREEN):
I said like a

11:34.080 --> 11:35.159
gazelle, not an elephant.

11:40.159 --> 11:41.320
TARA (OFFSCREEN): How
many is that?

11:41.360 --> 11:44.720
-23, not including the partial
rewind after 15.

11:44.759 --> 11:45.559
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): I'm
sorry to interrupt

11:45.600 --> 11:46.919
your morning, Sammy.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.799
But I'm not too keen on
splitting my head open because

11:48.840 --> 11:51.200
you lack upper body strength.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.159
So that means one of us has to
deconstruct pas de deux--

11:54.200 --> 11:56.480
since I'm wasting my lunch
hour with Tara.

11:56.519 --> 11:58.240
-You're spending lunch
with Abigail?

11:58.279 --> 11:58.919
-Long story.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.159
She owes me a mirror.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.519
-Lost something?

12:04.559 --> 12:05.559
-My camera.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.639
Had a lot of seagulls on it.

12:06.679 --> 12:07.799
-Where'd you have it last?

12:07.840 --> 12:09.399
-In here, last night.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.559
-What?

12:10.600 --> 12:11.399
When you were talking to
Christian's friend?

12:11.440 --> 12:12.679
-What's that supposed to mean?

12:12.720 --> 12:14.799
-The guy thinks it's funny
to rob petrol stations.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.399
Of course he'd steal
your stuff.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.399
-I only told Abigail.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.320
-Did I just hear that right?

12:20.360 --> 12:21.799
Christian's friend robbed
a petrol station.

12:21.840 --> 12:22.919
-Yeah.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.080
But he wouldn't steal
from us, would he?

12:25.120 --> 12:26.440
Would he?

12:26.480 --> 12:27.720
-Would he what?

12:27.759 --> 12:29.159
-Your friend stole
Kat's camera.

12:29.200 --> 12:29.480
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): No.

12:29.519 --> 12:30.159
No.

12:30.200 --> 12:30.480
It's missing.

12:30.519 --> 12:31.360
OK?

12:31.399 --> 12:32.200
It could just be
a coincidence.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.159
-We're not saying he stole it.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.159
-Don't hear you saying
he didn't.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.360
-Just get it back, yeah?

12:41.240 --> 12:42.600
-Hey, girls.

12:42.639 --> 12:44.159
Do you want a go?

12:44.200 --> 12:45.360
I hear dancers are pretty
good on their feet.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.080
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN): Hey.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.480
-Here he is.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.720
Mate, do you always have
this effect on women?

12:52.759 --> 12:53.799
-Kat's missing a camera.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.639
Red one, apparently.

12:54.679 --> 12:56.039
Seen it?

12:56.080 --> 12:57.720
-Well, are you asking
or accusing?

12:57.759 --> 13:00.559
-You tell me.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.159
-You've really lost it, Cheds.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.480
These rich kids have
done your head in.

13:03.519 --> 13:05.240
-So where were you last night?

13:05.279 --> 13:06.759
-Oh, well, you know what?

13:06.799 --> 13:08.799
I snuck into Kat's room and I
stole her little dinky camera.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.080
Where do you think I was?

13:10.120 --> 13:13.039
-I don't know, Aaron.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.279
-I don't need this.

13:18.080 --> 13:18.720
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Abigail,
we only have

13:18.759 --> 13:19.480
half an hour for lunch.

13:19.519 --> 13:20.679
Is this place close?

13:27.879 --> 13:28.600
Blackforest.

13:28.639 --> 13:31.240
I'd kill for blackforest.

13:31.279 --> 13:34.639
-344 calories and 19.3
grams of fat--

13:34.679 --> 13:38.120
that carrot cake, which people
think is healthier, has 22.8

13:38.159 --> 13:39.799
grams and 387 calories.

13:39.840 --> 13:40.840
-Whoa, that's freakish.

13:40.879 --> 13:41.720
-We're dancers.

13:41.759 --> 13:43.519
We have to know this stuff.

13:43.559 --> 13:46.399
-Since when did you become
encyclopedic about cake?

13:46.440 --> 13:48.799
It's not like you eat it.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.480
I have never seen you put so
much as one morsel of cake in

13:51.519 --> 13:52.840
your mouth.

13:52.879 --> 13:54.120
-It's comforting to know you're
keeping tabs on my food

13:54.159 --> 13:55.600
intake like that, Tara.

13:55.639 --> 13:57.240
-Well, it's not hard to keep
tabs on a few celery stick and

13:57.279 --> 14:00.159
some carrot.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.399
OK.

14:09.399 --> 14:12.480
How can you not eat that now?

14:12.519 --> 14:14.440
-It's called self control.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.639
Try it.

14:34.559 --> 14:35.519
It's ugly.

14:35.559 --> 14:37.480
Let me guess.

14:37.519 --> 14:39.799
You love it.

14:39.840 --> 14:43.279
-It is from Europe, like me.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.360
It's also very old, like me.

14:45.399 --> 14:48.399
TARA (OFFSCREEN): It's very
beautiful, but out of our

14:48.440 --> 14:49.320
price range--

14:49.360 --> 14:50.720
way out of our price range.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.200
-You like antiques?

14:52.240 --> 14:53.320
-My nana did.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.360
She liked the way they
had another life.

14:55.399 --> 14:56.360
-Some mystery.

14:56.399 --> 14:58.639
-Exactly.

14:58.679 --> 15:00.480
-Did you see this?

15:00.519 --> 15:01.720
Look.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.639
-Oh, Abigail, it's you.

15:12.519 --> 15:14.399
-You evil girls.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.799
-No.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.080
-You distract me while your
friend, she steals from my

15:18.120 --> 15:18.440
shop.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.039
-No, no.

15:19.080 --> 15:19.840
We weren't.

15:19.879 --> 15:20.519
But-- but that's not what--

15:20.559 --> 15:21.720
-Oh, I don't think so.

15:21.759 --> 15:22.639
-I can explain.

15:22.679 --> 15:23.799
Abigail.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.240
-Explain to the police.

15:25.279 --> 15:26.440
-But--

15:36.200 --> 15:37.279
KAT (OFFSCREEN): It's not like
we said Christian took it.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.120
-Although to be fair,
he hasn't exactly

15:40.159 --> 15:41.320
been honest with us.

15:43.799 --> 15:45.799
-It kind of just makes you
think that we don't--

15:45.840 --> 15:49.679
-We don't even really
know him.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.159
-Aaron's gone.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.039
He said he didn't take your
camera, but I'll get you a new

15:54.080 --> 15:54.840
one.

15:54.879 --> 15:55.679
-No, Christian, you don't--

15:59.840 --> 16:04.799
-Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Reed, you
have misplaced your partners?

16:04.840 --> 16:05.480
-No.

16:05.519 --> 16:06.519
They-- they're coming.

16:06.559 --> 16:08.159
I think they're just late.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.279
MS. RAINE (OFFSCREEN):
How observant.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.799
Shall we begin?

16:12.840 --> 16:14.240
-Without partners?

16:14.279 --> 16:15.799
-Mr. Lieberman, meet Mr. Reed.

16:21.440 --> 16:26.480
-So, um, who's gonna
be the girl?

16:26.519 --> 16:27.440
OK.

16:27.480 --> 16:28.639
Sweet.

16:28.679 --> 16:29.480
-No answer.

16:29.519 --> 16:30.679
Class must have started.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.480
What is wrong with you?

16:35.519 --> 16:37.600
-She's being completely
reasonable to hold us here.

16:37.639 --> 16:39.399
-You were going to steal it.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.519
It was probably you
this morning, too.

16:40.559 --> 16:41.840
No wonder you accused Aaron.

16:41.879 --> 16:43.399
-I didn't take anything
from Kat.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.679
-No, just stuff you don't need
from nice old ladies.

16:50.519 --> 16:51.600
She's calling the police.

16:51.639 --> 16:52.799
-You don't know that.

16:55.679 --> 16:56.639
If we could climb up
there, we'd be

16:56.679 --> 16:57.840
able to hear her better.

17:02.159 --> 17:03.799
-Any time, Lieberman.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.039
-Looks like your boyfriend
wants to drop you.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.400
-Focus.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.160
-Too heavy.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.440
You're gonna buckle.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.079
-Ready?

17:10.118 --> 17:12.440
One, two, three.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.440
-Yeah.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.799
-Turn around.

17:14.839 --> 17:16.200
Again.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.000
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): It's
in the timing, isn't it?

17:23.039 --> 17:25.358
You're not actually that
much lighter than me.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.598
What can you see?

17:26.640 --> 17:27.759
TARA (OFFSCREEN): She's
on the phone.

17:27.799 --> 17:28.720
-Two children--

17:28.759 --> 17:29.319
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN):
I knew that.

17:29.359 --> 17:30.240
Can you hear her?

17:30.279 --> 17:31.440
TARA (OFFSCREEN): No.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.119
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): Tara,
what's happening?

17:32.160 --> 17:33.440
-Abigail, put me down.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.519
-What?

17:34.559 --> 17:35.759
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Abigail,
put me down.

17:35.799 --> 17:36.720
-I can't.

17:36.759 --> 17:38.079
TARA (OFFSCREEN):
She's looking.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.200
-Aristocratic chins.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.039
Don't rush.

17:52.079 --> 17:53.240
Don't rush.

18:08.799 --> 18:10.160
Firmly on the hip.

18:14.680 --> 18:17.319
-Ms. Raine, Christian Reed.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.240
-Last night, 2:00 AM, corner of
Ellison and Belmore Roads

18:26.279 --> 18:29.240
in Randwick, there was an
attempted smash and grab on a

18:29.279 --> 18:30.079
cash machine.

18:30.119 --> 18:32.279
What can you tell me about it?

18:32.319 --> 18:33.680
-Nothing.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.200
I mean, I haven't left
school all week.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.160
You can ask anyone.

18:36.200 --> 18:36.960
OFFICER (OFFSCREEN): That's not

18:37.000 --> 18:38.160
what I'm asking, Christian.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.319
We've already charged
one offender--

18:40.359 --> 18:42.599
Bo Longley, a known associate
of Aaron Dean.

18:42.640 --> 18:43.839
-Did you want to speak to him?

18:43.880 --> 18:47.480
Because he's not here anymore.

18:47.519 --> 18:49.759
He was here last
night, though.

18:49.799 --> 18:50.799
He needed somewhere to crash.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.839
Had a fight with his gran.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.519
-You understand how
serious this is?

18:55.559 --> 18:56.680
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN): Yes.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.680
I should have asked if
he could stay first.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.400
I'm sorry, sir.

19:04.319 --> 19:06.319
You have everything.

19:06.359 --> 19:08.079
-No one has everything.

19:08.119 --> 19:09.160
-Do you want to get caught?

19:09.200 --> 19:12.200
Is it like a cry for
help or something?

19:12.240 --> 19:13.359
-Hardly.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.519
If it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be here.

19:14.559 --> 19:16.400
TARA (OFFSCREEN): This
is so not my fault.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.279
We're stuck in a room waiting
for the police.

19:19.319 --> 19:20.480
I deserve an explanation.

19:31.559 --> 19:34.759
-I think it's about the moment
I get away with it--

19:34.799 --> 19:37.839
like I can slow down time and
take the thing right out from

19:37.880 --> 19:40.240
under their noses.

19:40.279 --> 19:43.359
I'm in complete control.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.599
Powerful.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.839
The only other feeling
that comes close is--

19:47.880 --> 19:49.200
-Dancing.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.599
-Or at least it used to.

19:57.119 --> 19:58.160
-So are you ever
gonna eat that?

19:58.200 --> 20:01.039
Or is that a control
thing too?

20:01.079 --> 20:02.359
-Abigail?

20:02.400 --> 20:02.759
-Excuse me.

20:02.799 --> 20:03.480
Hello?

20:03.519 --> 20:04.279
-What are you doing?

20:04.319 --> 20:05.799
-I'm getting us out of here.

20:05.839 --> 20:07.160
-Excuse me.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.599
AARON (OFFSCREEN): Looking
good, Cheddar.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.200
-The school knows you
stayed last night.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.400
They're not happy.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.200
-I didn't mean to cause
you any grief.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.480
How'd they find out?

20:28.519 --> 20:29.519
-Don't worry.

20:29.559 --> 20:31.200
I told the cops you were
here all night.

20:31.240 --> 20:31.559
-Right.

20:31.599 --> 20:33.440
Thanks.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.680
-So where were you?

20:35.720 --> 20:36.799
-I got a call from
the Longleys--

20:36.839 --> 20:37.839
just at the last minute.

20:37.880 --> 20:38.400
I didn't even know
it was gonna be--

20:38.440 --> 20:39.519
-Right.

20:39.559 --> 20:41.160
So it's just luck that
I was your alibi.

20:41.200 --> 20:41.759
-Hey, hey, hey.

20:41.799 --> 20:43.200
I swear I wasn't--

20:43.240 --> 20:46.319
-Look, you know, it was great
seeing you and all, but I

20:46.359 --> 20:47.480
should have known.

20:47.519 --> 20:49.039
There's always an angle.

20:49.079 --> 20:50.400
-Don't be like that, Cheds.

20:50.440 --> 20:53.440
-No, the whole reason I'm even
here is because of you.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.559
Come help me out on something.

20:54.599 --> 20:55.559
No one will get hurt.

20:55.599 --> 20:57.759
It's a service station.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.400
Easy money.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.799
And now the cops are
at my school.

21:00.839 --> 21:01.440
-Hey, hey, hey.

21:01.480 --> 21:02.440
It'll be sweet.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.640
A couple months, this'll
all be over.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.440
-You don't know that.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.759
-Trust me, all right?

21:05.799 --> 21:07.440
-Yeah, because that's really
helped me in the past.

21:07.480 --> 21:08.680
AARON (OFFSCREEN): So leave.

21:08.720 --> 21:09.559
Ditch a lot of it.

21:09.599 --> 21:10.759
Indonesia's calling.

21:13.720 --> 21:14.680
-No.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.400
Not this time.

21:17.440 --> 21:17.839
-What?

21:17.880 --> 21:20.160
That's it?

21:20.200 --> 21:21.519
-Yeah.

21:21.559 --> 21:22.759
I'm staying.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.480
You think they'll ever let
you be one of the,?

21:28.519 --> 21:31.160
A ballet boy?

21:31.200 --> 21:33.279
You can't change, mate.

21:33.319 --> 21:33.920
Nobody can.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.240
They don't let you.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.400
-We have exams coming
up and the

21:54.440 --> 21:55.519
pressure's just really intense.

21:55.559 --> 21:56.640
I lost my head.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.559
I've never done anything
like this before.

21:58.599 --> 21:59.799
I'm just so ashamed.

22:02.839 --> 22:04.359
-And you will never come back?

22:04.400 --> 22:06.039
-Never.

22:06.079 --> 22:07.720
Never.

22:07.759 --> 22:09.640
-Go.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.480
-And the police?

22:11.519 --> 22:14.799
-I only phoned directory
assistance.

22:14.839 --> 22:20.599
But if you ever steal from my
shop again, I will call them.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.799
And they will deal with you.

22:22.839 --> 22:24.160
-Thank you so much.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.279
TARA (OFFSCREEN): That lizard I
was telling you about comes

22:28.319 --> 22:31.519
from the bush, which looks
beautiful, but is actually a

22:31.559 --> 22:35.240
pretty tough place,
a bit like here.

22:35.279 --> 22:38.319
We can't change color like the
lizard, but we all have our

22:38.359 --> 22:39.519
own defense mechanisms.

22:48.599 --> 22:51.599
-Just cut it off.

22:51.640 --> 22:53.480
-Thanks for trying to fix it.

22:53.519 --> 22:55.240
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Some of us
build an armor so that no one

22:55.279 --> 22:56.440
can get close.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.319
And others grow thorns, hoping
to scare the world away.

23:06.839 --> 23:09.799
But sometimes, the best survival
technique is just to

23:09.839 --> 23:11.799
accept that not everyone
is your enemy.

23:16.359 --> 23:17.000
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Found
it wedged in

23:17.039 --> 23:18.480
the couch this morning.

23:18.519 --> 23:21.640
I'm a bad person.

23:21.680 --> 23:23.480
-Yeah, that couch is
like a black hole.

23:23.519 --> 23:27.640
-So do you want to talk about
petrol stations or Aaron?

23:27.680 --> 23:28.599
-No.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.079
-OK.

23:31.119 --> 23:32.400
-But I'll have one
of those rolls.

23:39.119 --> 23:39.839
-Ugh.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.599
How do you eat that stuff?

23:42.640 --> 23:44.839
-Get them away from my food.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.400
-Hey, you reckon if I smother
them in bacon fat they'd let

23:46.440 --> 23:47.440
me stop wearing them?

23:47.480 --> 23:49.079
-You could give them to me.

23:49.119 --> 23:50.559
CHRISTIAN (OFFSCREEN): Or he
could leave them on the couch.

23:50.599 --> 23:52.119
-Apparently, it's a black hole.
