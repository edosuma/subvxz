00:07.499 --> 00:09.263
<i>Now I'm using my knowledge</i>

00:09.311 --> 00:11.881

This is <i>Nathan for you.</i>

00:25.499 --> 00:29.499
<i>Andy Farshidian is the president
of Andy O.C. Taxi Company,</i>

00:29.499 --> 00:31.499
<i>and he blames all his troubles
on one thing.</i>

00:35.751 --> 00:37.499
<i>Trendy ride-sharing programs,
like Uber,</i>

00:37.499 --> 00:39.499
<i>have been
grabbing headlines lately</i>

00:39.499 --> 00:43.499
<i>and caused taxi companies
like Andy's to take a big hit.</i>

00:43.499 --> 00:44.702
I want to be honest
with you.

00:44.750 --> 00:47.499
I'm very broke.
You know what I mean?

00:47.499 --> 00:48.499
Very broke.

00:48.499 --> 00:50.499
<i>So I paid him a visit
with a guaranteed way</i>

00:50.499 --> 00:52.499
<i>to get his company
back in the spotlight.</i>

00:52.499 --> 00:55.499
The ride-share programs,
you know,

00:55.499 --> 00:59.499
- are screwing you, right?
- Right.

00:59.499 --> 01:02.499
You know, they took lots of
the customers from cab business.

01:02.499 --> 01:05.498
And you need to get the
attention that they're getting.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.499
And the way to do that

01:07.499 --> 01:10.499
is to give free rides
to pregnant women.

01:10.499 --> 01:13.499
How this connected
to the, you know,

01:13.499 --> 01:15.499
success in the cab business?

01:15.499 --> 01:17.499
<i>Every time a baby is born
in a taxicab,</i>

01:17.499 --> 01:19.499
<i>it becomes
a huge news story.</i>

01:19.499 --> 01:21.499
<i>So if Andy did
a special promotion</i>

01:21.499 --> 01:24.499
<i>where he offered free rides
to women who were pregnant,</i>

01:24.499 --> 01:25.999
<i>it would only be
a matter of time</i>

01:26.041 --> 01:29.499
<i>until the miracle of life
happened in an O.C. Taxi cab.</i>

01:29.499 --> 01:32.499
<i>The plan-- increase the odds
of a backseat birth</i>

01:32.499 --> 01:36.499
<i>with free rides
for the pregnant.</i>

01:36.499 --> 01:38.499
I never had the--
I never thought about this.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.499
You just do it
till you get one.

01:40.499 --> 01:42.499
Then you'll get
all this press.

01:42.499 --> 01:44.499
Yeah,
that would be great.

01:44.499 --> 01:47.499
I-I should ask.
Your cabs are clean, right?

01:47.499 --> 01:49.499
Yeah, sure.

01:49.499 --> 01:50.499
<i>Andy was on board.</i>

01:50.499 --> 01:53.499
<i>Now I needed to get pregnant
women aware of the promotion,</i>

01:53.499 --> 01:55.030
<i>so I approached
a yoga studio</i>

01:55.099 --> 01:56.499
<i>that offers
prenatal classes</i>

01:56.499 --> 01:59.499
<i>and asked them to get
the word out to their students.</i>

01:59.499 --> 02:01.499
And that would be great
if you could push this.

02:01.499 --> 02:03.499
Why only
in their third trimester?

02:03.499 --> 02:06.499
That more is-- has to do
with our marketing needs.

02:06.499 --> 02:08.499
Got it.

02:08.499 --> 02:10.499
<i>And within a few days,
we started getting calls.</i>

02:10.499 --> 02:13.499
<i>So I headed out with
one of Andy's drivers, Armen,</i>

02:13.499 --> 02:15.499
<i>and while we waited
for our first customer,</i>

02:15.499 --> 02:17.436
I got to know him
a little bit.

02:17.468 --> 02:19.233
So do you have
any secrets?

02:21.499 --> 02:23.499
Yeah, I have secrets, but...

02:23.499 --> 02:26.499
When I told you,
that is a not secret.

02:26.499 --> 02:29.499
Hmm. Fair enough.

02:31.499 --> 02:34.499
Bad secrets?

02:34.499 --> 02:36.499
I think, yeah.

02:36.499 --> 02:38.499
- Yeah?
- I think.

02:38.499 --> 02:41.280
<i>And moments later, it was time
to start giving rides</i>

02:41.296 --> 02:42.499
<i>to pregnant women.</i>

02:42.499 --> 02:44.499
So how far along
are you?

02:44.499 --> 02:47.499
I'm 30-- 37 weeks.

02:47.499 --> 02:49.499
So any--

02:49.499 --> 02:51.499
- anytime soon.
- Anytime.

02:51.499 --> 02:53.499
<i>But with a woman
who is nine months pregnant</i>

02:53.499 --> 02:54.499
<i>now in the backseat,</i>

02:54.499 --> 02:57.499
<i>the reality of what I was doing
began to set in.</i>

02:57.499 --> 02:59.499
<i>I hadn't taken
any safety precautions at all.</i>

02:59.499 --> 03:02.499
<i>And if a woman were to have
a baby in here,</i>

03:02.499 --> 03:04.499
<i>would Armen,
with all those secrets,</i>

03:04.499 --> 03:05.499
<i>be fit to deliver it?</i>

03:05.499 --> 03:06.499
<i>And that
made me realize</i>

03:06.499 --> 03:08.877
<i>there might be a better way
to do this.</i>

03:08.939 --> 03:11.329
<i>It occurred to me
that a hatchback taxi</i>

03:11.381 --> 03:12.827
<i>and a hospital
birthing table</i>

03:12.874 --> 03:14.499
<i>have very similar qualities,</i>

03:14.499 --> 03:17.499
<i>and a hybrid of the two
could be the solution I needed.</i>

03:17.499 --> 03:19.499
<i>Throw in sterile conditions</i>

03:19.499 --> 03:22.499
<i>and a medical professional
to deliver the baby,</i>

03:22.499 --> 03:24.499
<i>and I'd have a completely safe
birthing option</i>

03:24.499 --> 03:26.499
<i>that would be
even more headline-worthy</i>

03:26.499 --> 03:28.499
<i>because it's never
been done before.</i>

03:28.499 --> 03:31.499
<i>So I put an ad on Craigslist
seeking pregnant women</i>

03:31.499 --> 03:33.499
<i>that hadn't yet decided
their birth plans,</i>

03:33.499 --> 03:34.952
<i>and within a few days,</i>

03:34.959 --> 03:37.390
<i>I got a response
from a woman named Shante</i>

03:37.421 --> 03:39.153
<i>who was seven months pregnant.</i>

03:39.197 --> 03:42.499
The way I see it is a cab
that would be at your house

03:42.499 --> 03:44.499
or very close
to your house.

03:44.499 --> 03:45.499
Okay.

03:45.499 --> 03:47.499
I'd want everything
to be completely sanitized

03:47.499 --> 03:51.499
in a way that's just as safe,
if not safer,

03:51.499 --> 03:52.499
than a hospital.

03:52.499 --> 03:55.066
I'm-- I'm not
opposed to it.

03:55.103 --> 03:58.499
I mean, I-I think
I would probably, uh,

03:58.499 --> 04:00.499
need to think
about it more

04:00.499 --> 04:03.499
and discuss it
with my-- my boyfriend.

04:03.499 --> 04:05.971
I mean, in a way, you
and your son would be famous.

04:06.015 --> 04:08.499
Yeah-- Well, yeah. Yeah.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.499
<i>Shante was
surprisingly intrigued,</i>

04:10.499 --> 04:13.499
<i>and I was stoked that
this might actually happen.</i>

04:13.499 --> 04:15.499
<i>So I went back to Andy
to bring him up to speed.</i>

04:15.499 --> 04:17.499
I actually
found a woman

04:17.499 --> 04:21.499
who potentially
might be willing

04:21.499 --> 04:24.499
to give birth
in one of your taxicabs.

04:24.499 --> 04:26.499
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

04:26.499 --> 04:27.499
How much she ask--
she ask?

04:27.499 --> 04:29.499
We haven't talked about money
or anything.

04:29.499 --> 04:32.499
- Oh.
- But I only want to do this

04:32.499 --> 04:34.499
if it can be done
completely safely.

04:34.499 --> 04:36.499
I try to be safe.

04:36.499 --> 04:38.499
You're not just saying that
right now, right?

04:38.499 --> 04:39.804
'cause I'll walk out
right now.

04:39.819 --> 04:41.819
- No, don't walk. I--
- For me, safety is number one.

04:41.843 --> 04:43.499
I assure you.
I assure you.

04:43.499 --> 04:45.499
Okay, 'cause I see
dollar signs in your eyes.

04:45.499 --> 04:47.499
I know, but one--
one eye is dollar sign,

04:47.499 --> 04:49.499
one eye is safety.

04:49.499 --> 04:52.499
- So dollar in one eye.
- Dollar in one eyes

04:52.499 --> 04:54.499
and babies
in the other eyes.

04:54.499 --> 04:55.499
It just is a baby.

04:55.499 --> 04:56.499
Just a baby sign,
yeah.

04:56.499 --> 04:58.499
What does the baby
look like?

04:58.499 --> 05:01.499
Looks like a small, cute baby
with a smile.

05:01.499 --> 05:02.499
- Good. All right.
- Okay.

05:02.499 --> 05:04.499
- Thank you so much.
- Sure, man.

05:04.499 --> 05:06.499
- Safety first.
- Of course, safety first,

05:06.499 --> 05:08.981
- baby second.
- Okay.

05:09.046 --> 05:10.046
<i>With Andy on board,</i>

05:10.099 --> 05:11.932
<i>the next step
was finding a location</i>

05:11.968 --> 05:13.499
<i>for the taxi birth
to take place.</i>

05:13.499 --> 05:15.499
<i>So I rented a warehouse
near Shante's house</i>

05:15.499 --> 05:17.499
<i>and had one of Andy's taxis
brought there</i>

05:17.499 --> 05:19.499
<i>to be
the birthing vehicle.</i>

05:19.499 --> 05:22.499
<i>Next, to make sure the birth
happened safely,</i>

05:22.499 --> 05:24.499
<i>I hired someone who'd be able
to deliver the baby.</i>

05:24.499 --> 05:26.499
- You're a midwife.
- I'm a student midwife.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.227
- You're a student midwife.
- Exactly.

05:28.238 --> 05:29.238
Okay. So you're not quite,

05:29.275 --> 05:31.078
but you pretty much know
the same stuff.

05:31.109 --> 05:31.982
Mm-hmm.

05:32.079 --> 05:33.844
<i>And she assured me
that doing it in a taxi</i>

05:33.906 --> 05:34.906
<i>would be no problem.</i>

05:34.954 --> 05:37.064
We're used to moms
giving birth wherever.

05:37.145 --> 05:39.499
<i>But just trusting the word
of a student midwife</i>

05:39.499 --> 05:41.499
<i>was a risk I wasn't willing
to take.</i>

05:41.499 --> 05:43.499
<i>So before showing this
to Shante,</i>

05:43.499 --> 05:47.499
<i>I had a licensed obstetrician,
Dr. Manzer S. Kuraishi, come in</i>

05:47.499 --> 05:50.499
<i>to ensure that Kim was fully
qualified to handle this birth.</i>

05:50.499 --> 05:52.499
If you went in
and checked out the midwife,

05:52.499 --> 05:54.499
you think you would be able
to tell if she knew

05:54.499 --> 05:56.499
- what she was doing or not?
- I can ask basic questions

05:56.499 --> 05:58.499
and see if she responds
appropriately.

05:58.499 --> 06:00.121
<i>Not wanting
to offend Kim</i>

06:00.134 --> 06:01.752
<i>by questioning
her expertise,</i>

06:01.795 --> 06:04.343
I had the doctor dress up
as a car mechanic,

06:04.358 --> 06:07.358
<i>so he could secretly vet her
to see if she was up to snuff.</i>

06:07.499 --> 06:08.499
- When you go in...
- Mm-hmm.

06:08.499 --> 06:10.499
You're a mechanic that's just
there to check out the car.

06:10.499 --> 06:11.499
- That's fine.
- Okay.

06:11.499 --> 06:14.499
You still sound
maybe a little bit smart.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.499
I don't know if there's a way
you could put on

06:16.499 --> 06:18.499
a more, like, average Joe accent
or something.

06:18.499 --> 06:22.499
I guess I can try to be more,
uh, run-of-the-mill.

06:22.499 --> 06:24.499
Yo, I'm here
to just check out the car.

06:24.499 --> 06:26.499
Uh, I'm here
to check out the car.

06:26.499 --> 06:29.499
- The cah.
- The car. Da cah.

06:29.499 --> 06:31.499
- Da cah, yeah.
- I'm here to check out the cah.

06:31.499 --> 06:32.499
Yeah, that's great.

06:33.278 --> 06:34.499
You think
that's gonna be better

06:34.499 --> 06:36.499
- than just using--
- Yeah, I think it'll help

06:36.499 --> 06:38.499
make you seem like
more of a mechanic.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.930
- All right. Okay.
- Okay. Great.

06:40.006 --> 06:41.233
<i>With the doctor all set,</i>

06:41.296 --> 06:43.296
<i>I brought him inside
to meet Kim.</i>

06:43.338 --> 06:45.499
- This is Teddy here.
- How you doing?

06:45.499 --> 06:47.499
- Hi, Teddy.
- I'm here to check out the car.

06:47.499 --> 06:48.499
- Okay.
- Teddy's a native

06:48.499 --> 06:50.499
- from Brooklyn, New York.
- Okay.

06:50.499 --> 06:52.499
- So...
- I'm looking for the accent.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.931
I've been listening
for the accent.

06:53.957 --> 06:55.499
Yeah. Comes and goes.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.499
- I used to live in Brooklyn.
- No. Where?

06:57.499 --> 06:59.499
What part--
What part are you from?

06:59.499 --> 07:01.499
- The North Side.
- North side of Brooklyn?

07:01.499 --> 07:03.459
Yeah. Well, anyways,
what do you got going here?

07:03.459 --> 07:06.499
<i>Our covert plan was working,
as Dr. Kuraishi was able</i>

07:06.499 --> 07:08.499
<i>to subtly slide in
medical questions</i>

07:08.499 --> 07:10.499
<i>without Kim suspecting
a thing.</i>

07:10.499 --> 07:12.436
Man, I'm from Brooklyn.
I'd rather have a pizza.

07:12.499 --> 07:13.846
I don't know about that,
but what--

07:13.894 --> 07:16.499
what happens if she does need
one of those epidural things?

07:16.499 --> 07:17.499
<i>And once he got
all he needed,</i>

07:17.499 --> 07:19.840
<i>he completed his inspection
of the car...</i>

07:20.624 --> 07:22.624
- Looks good.
<i>- and met me outside,</i>

07:22.624 --> 07:24.031
<i>where I awaited
his report.</i>

07:24.093 --> 07:25.458
For the majority
of deliveries,

07:25.491 --> 07:26.718
it would be
absolutely fine.

07:26.765 --> 07:27.765
- You think so?
- Yeah.

07:27.829 --> 07:30.250
Because the majority
of deliveries happen naturally.

07:30.327 --> 07:33.499
<i>Dr. Kuraishi's evaluation
gave me confidence in my plan.</i>

07:33.499 --> 07:36.499
<i>Now all I needed
was for Shante to say yes.</i>

07:38.691 --> 07:40.223
<i>The day
had finally arrived,</i>

07:40.248 --> 07:42.414
<i>and with the birthing vehicle
medically sound,</i>

07:42.461 --> 07:45.867
<i>I had a P.A. come in early
to sterilize the warehouse.</i>

07:45.867 --> 07:48.245
<i>Now it was time to see
if I could convince Shante</i>

07:48.287 --> 07:50.867
<i>and her boyfriend, Damian,
to have their firstborn child</i>

07:50.867 --> 07:53.363
<i>in an Andy O.C. Taxi Cab.</i>

07:53.534 --> 07:54.867
Pretty great, huh?

07:54.867 --> 07:57.660
Hmm.

07:57.867 --> 07:59.867
- As you can see, it's...
- Wow.

07:59.867 --> 08:01.867
- Completely done up.
- Totally different.

08:01.867 --> 08:04.867
- Wow, totally different.
- Wow.

08:04.867 --> 08:07.336
<i>After explaining to them
how it would all work,</i>

08:07.414 --> 08:09.867
<i>I eagerly awaited
the couple's decision.</i>

08:10.586 --> 08:13.586
The-- The idea--
Everything is great.

08:13.635 --> 08:16.867
But now that I actually see
the finished product,

08:16.867 --> 08:18.867
I feel like

08:18.867 --> 08:21.867
- I'm not 100%.
- Yeah.

08:21.867 --> 08:24.410
Is it 'cause there's not
enough towels or...

08:24.867 --> 08:26.867
No. Actually--
Actually, I love the towels.

08:26.867 --> 08:27.867
- Oh, okay. Great.
- The towels are actually--

08:27.867 --> 08:28.867
No, it's not that.
It's just that

08:28.867 --> 08:30.867
if-- if everything was,

08:30.867 --> 08:33.866
you know, to be set up like
an actual hospital--

08:33.866 --> 08:35.866
<i>I was surprised
that Shante and Damian</i>

08:35.866 --> 08:36.866
<i>were having cold feet.</i>

08:36.866 --> 08:39.866
<i>Fortunately,
I had a plan "B."</i>

08:39.866 --> 08:43.866
At the end of the day,
we can't forget

08:43.866 --> 08:45.867
- who this is all about.
- Yeah.

08:45.867 --> 08:48.867
Uh, Andy, who's the owner
of the O.C. Taxi Company.

08:48.867 --> 08:50.867
- Oh.
- So before you leave,

08:50.867 --> 08:53.867
I do think,
you know,

08:53.867 --> 08:56.867
- you should hear from him.
- Okay.

08:56.867 --> 08:58.867
<i>With the couple on the brink
of walking away,</i>

08:58.867 --> 09:00.867
<i>my only hope was a plea
from the man</i>

09:00.867 --> 09:02.867
<i>who needed their help
the most.</i>

09:02.867 --> 09:05.867
<i>So it was now in Andy's hands
to win them over.</i>

09:05.867 --> 09:09.867
I had a sign, you know,
in my cab a for long, long time,

09:09.867 --> 09:10.867
and I never use it,
you know?

09:10.867 --> 09:13.867
And when you have
your baby come out,

09:13.867 --> 09:17.867
the first thing
he or she open their eyes,

09:17.867 --> 09:19.867
I have that sign
for that kids.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.867
And the sign
says what?

09:21.867 --> 09:22.867
It says,
"You are cute."

09:22.867 --> 09:24.867
- You are cute?
- Cute.

09:24.867 --> 09:26.255
- She or he cannot read it.
- Yeah.

09:26.286 --> 09:28.657
But goes on the mind--
goes on the brain

09:28.752 --> 09:30.867
and stay there,
you know what I mean?

09:30.867 --> 09:32.867
Yeah. I think you guys
would have to do too much

09:32.867 --> 09:36.867
other stuff to accommodate
what I'm looking for.

09:36.867 --> 09:37.867
Please.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.581
But if there's anything else
we could do,

09:39.597 --> 09:41.217
like, maybe, like,
word of mouth.

09:41.237 --> 09:43.867
Can you do me a favor
and think a little bit more...

09:43.867 --> 09:44.867
Andy. Andy.

09:44.867 --> 09:46.718
And please give me
this chance?

09:46.744 --> 09:47.867
Yeah, I think
it's just gonna--

09:47.867 --> 09:49.867
we're just gonna have it
at the hospital.

09:49.867 --> 09:51.867
- Oh, I give you 100% guarantee.
- Andy. Andy. Andy.

09:51.867 --> 09:53.365
- Anything that you want.
- No, Andy--

09:53.393 --> 09:54.867
Yeah. Thank you so much,
though, for the offer.

09:54.867 --> 09:55.848
- Yeah.
- I don't think

09:55.910 --> 09:57.867
- they want to do it.
- Give me a minute.

09:57.867 --> 10:01.867
<i>Damian and Shante said no,
but Andy wouldn't give up.</i>

10:01.867 --> 10:03.867
- So it's about you?
- No, it's not about me, no.

10:03.867 --> 10:04.867
Well, you sound
like it is.

10:04.867 --> 10:06.867
This is a good opportunity
for you.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.867
No. You're trying to convince us,
but at the end of the day,

10:08.867 --> 10:10.867
it seems like
it's all about you.

10:10.867 --> 10:12.867
<i>The baby sign was gone
from his eyes</i>

10:12.867 --> 10:15.867
<i>and replaced
with another dollar sign.</i>

10:15.867 --> 10:17.867
<i>He was no longer seeing them
as human beings,</i>

10:17.867 --> 10:19.867
<i>but instead, just a way
to get rich.</i>

10:19.867 --> 10:22.867
<i>So I had to do what was right
and let them go.</i>

10:22.867 --> 10:26.867
- Please, think again.
- Andy, okay.

10:26.867 --> 10:28.867
You can go.
Thank you.

10:28.867 --> 10:30.867
<i>It was sad that things
didn't work out</i>

10:30.867 --> 10:32.571
<i>the way that Andy wanted.</i>

10:32.606 --> 10:33.867
<i>But sometimes in business,</i>

10:33.867 --> 10:36.867
<i>success also means knowing
when to stop.</i>

10:36.867 --> 10:38.867
I think
what happened today

10:38.867 --> 10:40.867
is a perfect example

10:40.867 --> 10:43.867
of greed
infecting someone's brain,

10:43.867 --> 10:47.867
and that infection happened
in yours.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.867
- You're right. You're right.
- You lost focus,

10:49.867 --> 10:53.867
and you forgot what's
the most important thing.

10:53.867 --> 10:54.867
Human life.

10:54.867 --> 10:58.867
What do you think
if we looking for another baby?

10:58.867 --> 11:02.867
I think we just have
to let this one go.

11:03.867 --> 11:06.867
Maybe somebody else
like it.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.867
I-I mean, maybe.

11:08.867 --> 11:11.867
You know, I can't guarantee it
100%, you know what I mean?

11:11.867 --> 11:13.867
Andy, I respect you so much
as a businessman,

11:14.867 --> 11:18.867
but I just don't think we see
eye to eye as human beings.

11:18.867 --> 11:20.867
Okay, good luck, kid.

11:20.867 --> 11:22.867
Okay.

11:22.867 --> 11:25.867
- Best of luck with everything.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

11:30.535 --> 11:32.473
<i>For a business,
nothing says success</i>

11:32.519 --> 11:34.035
<i>like a line
down the block.</i>

11:34.035 --> 11:36.035
<i>And for L.A.'s Pink's Hot Dogs,</i>

11:36.035 --> 11:38.035
<i>they've got that
down pat.</i>

11:38.035 --> 11:39.523
<i>But even though
things are going well,</i>

11:39.568 --> 11:41.035
<i>owners,
Gloria and Richard Pink,</i>

11:41.035 --> 11:43.035
<i>are always looking
to step things up.</i>

11:43.035 --> 11:46.035
Any business that isn't
improving is falling behind.

11:46.035 --> 11:48.669
Yeah, we're always looking for
ways to improve the business.

11:48.748 --> 11:51.035
<i>The Pinks were clearly crazy
about their brand.</i>

11:51.035 --> 11:53.035
<i>But when I went undercover
to scope things out,</i>

11:53.035 --> 11:55.035
<i>I discovered
a glaring problem</i>

11:55.035 --> 11:58.035
<i>that was keeping them
from making even more money.</i>

11:58.035 --> 11:59.035
<i>So I paid the couple
a visit</i>

11:59.035 --> 12:01.035
<i>with a way to attract
a new type of customer.</i>

12:02.035 --> 12:04.035
I wore
a pink shirt today

12:04.035 --> 12:06.035
because your name
is Pink's.

12:06.035 --> 12:10.035
Right. Okay.

12:10.035 --> 12:12.035
<i>Right now,
the huge line at Pink's</i>

12:12.035 --> 12:13.742
<i>is turning off
a slew of customers</i>

12:13.766 --> 12:15.035
<i>that don't have time
to wait.</i>

12:15.035 --> 12:17.035
<i>But Richard and Gloria
would easily be able</i>

12:17.035 --> 12:20.035
<i>to capture those sales
with a simple rule change--</i>

12:20.035 --> 12:24.035
<i>line cutting allowed
if you're in a hurry.</i>

12:24.035 --> 12:26.035
I hate to, like,
prejudge it,

12:26.035 --> 12:28.035
but customers that saw

12:28.035 --> 12:31.035
that someone else
got an advantage

12:31.035 --> 12:33.035
would probably be upset.

12:33.035 --> 12:35.035
I want you guys to know
that I'm determined

12:35.035 --> 12:37.035
to protect your brand
at all costs.

12:37.035 --> 12:39.035
All right, so let's see
how you do that.

12:39.035 --> 12:41.035
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:41.035 --> 12:43.035
<i>The Pinks agreed to let me
prove my idea to them</i>

12:43.035 --> 12:45.035
<i>during the Friday
lunch rush.</i>

12:45.035 --> 12:47.665
<i>So the next day I placed a sign
near the street</i>

12:47.723 --> 12:49.320
<i>advertising the new rule.</i>

12:49.551 --> 12:52.330
<i>To avoid chaos by everyone
saying they were in a rush,</i>

12:52.379 --> 12:54.832
<i>I came up with a list
of five acceptable reasons</i>

12:55.035 --> 12:56.532
<i>for cutting
to the front of the line...</i>

12:56.659 --> 12:58.879
Doctor's appointment,
job interview,

12:58.957 --> 13:01.319
<i>picking up a kid from school,
funeral,</i>

13:01.409 --> 13:04.129
<i>or if you're an air traffic
controller who's late for work.</i>

13:04.510 --> 13:06.997
<i>The new policy seemed to be
attracting customers</i>

13:07.035 --> 13:08.035
<i>who were driving by</i>

13:08.035 --> 13:11.035
<i>even though most of them
didn't qualify for line cutting.</i>

13:11.035 --> 13:12.035
Uh, no.

13:14.578 --> 13:16.691
But you're not
an air traffic controller.

13:16.783 --> 13:19.488
<i>But there were several people
with legitimate places to be.</i>

13:19.507 --> 13:21.035
You have
a doctor's appointment today?

13:21.035 --> 13:22.473
- Yes.
- And who's your doctor?

13:22.507 --> 13:24.035
- Dr. Pia.
- Dr. Pia?

13:24.035 --> 13:26.035
<i>Dr. Pia's office.</i>

13:26.035 --> 13:29.035
Hi, I'm calling to confirm
an appointment for...

13:29.253 --> 13:30.394
- Jason.
- Jason...

13:30.430 --> 13:31.416
- Wolf.
- Wolf.

13:31.506 --> 13:34.035
<i>Yeah, we have Jason
coming in at 5:30.</i>

13:34.035 --> 13:36.035
Great.
Okay, thank you so much.

13:36.035 --> 13:38.035
<i>And once I was able to confirm
their reason...</i>

13:38.035 --> 13:39.035
He has to cut in line.
He has a doctor's appointment.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.035
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, that's okay.

13:40.035 --> 13:42.035
Okay.

13:42.035 --> 13:43.035
<i>...customers could cut
to the front of the line</i>

13:43.035 --> 13:45.035
<i>without anyone getting angry.</i>

13:45.035 --> 13:47.035
<i>As the day went on, the system
seemed to be working great.</i>

13:47.035 --> 13:49.035
- You are going to a funeral.
- Yeah.

13:49.035 --> 13:50.035
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

13:50.035 --> 13:52.035
- Who's the funeral for?
- Connie Mendel.

13:52.035 --> 13:54.035
- A friend of mine.
- Oh, I'm so sorry

13:54.035 --> 13:55.035
- for your loss.
- It's okay. It's okay.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.035
<i>But as the lunch rush
was winding down,</i>

13:57.035 --> 13:59.035
<i>I saw something
that disturbed me.</i>

13:59.500 --> 14:02.035
<i>One customer that I met earlier
said he was in a hurry.</i>

14:02.035 --> 14:04.035
I have a doctor's appointment.
I forgot.

14:04.035 --> 14:06.035
You have
a doctor's appointment today?

14:06.035 --> 14:07.973
- Yes. Mm-hmm.
- You really do?

14:08.035 --> 14:09.035
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- But when I tried</i>

14:09.035 --> 14:11.035
<i>to confirm it, he couldn't
give me any information.</i>

14:11.035 --> 14:14.035
- What's your doctor's number or--
- I don't have his number.

14:14.035 --> 14:16.035
I just--
I don't have it with me.

14:16.035 --> 14:17.723
I just have to go
at 3:00.

14:17.883 --> 14:20.035
<i>Giving him
the benefit of the doubt,</i>

14:20.035 --> 14:22.035
<i>I allowed him
to cut to the front.</i>

14:22.035 --> 14:24.035
<i>But now,
45 minutes later,</i>

14:24.035 --> 14:27.035
<i>he was still sitting there
taking his time.</i>

14:27.035 --> 14:28.035
<i>And I began to suspect</i>

14:28.035 --> 14:30.035
<i>that he didn't have
a doctor's appointment at all.</i>

14:30.035 --> 14:33.035
<i>So I told one of my cameramen
to secretly follow him</i>

14:33.035 --> 14:36.035
<i>to his car,
and once he drove off,</i>

14:36.035 --> 14:38.035
<i>I followed
in close pursuit</i>

14:38.035 --> 14:41.035
<i>to see if he was
telling the truth.</i>

14:43.035 --> 14:46.035
A bit late for the doctor
by now, aren't we?

14:46.035 --> 14:47.035
Huh.

14:47.035 --> 14:49.035
<i>After 30 minutes
of tailing him,</i>

14:49.035 --> 14:52.035
<i>he led us
straight into a lie.</i>

14:52.035 --> 14:55.035
<i>He wasn't
going to the doctor.</i>

14:55.035 --> 14:57.035
<i>He was
seeing a movie instead,</i>

14:57.035 --> 15:00.035
<i>an excuse
that wasn't on my list.</i>

15:00.035 --> 15:02.035
<i>It was
an unbelievable slap in the face</i>

15:02.035 --> 15:03.035
<i>to the Pink's name.</i>

15:03.332 --> 15:05.611
<i>So that evening,
I returned to the restaurant</i>

15:05.660 --> 15:08.035
<i>to see how Gloria
wanted to handle this.</i>

15:08.035 --> 15:09.035
So he--
he cut in line,

15:09.035 --> 15:11.035
got his food,
and then later?

15:11.035 --> 15:13.035
- He went to see a movie.
- Ah.

15:13.035 --> 15:17.035
You know, I think if you
don't do something to respond,

15:17.035 --> 15:19.035
it could make you, as a brand,
look weak.

15:19.035 --> 15:22.035
Well...

15:22.035 --> 15:25.035
So with your permission, I'd
like to take this guy on a boat,

15:25.035 --> 15:27.035
and then once
he's trapped at sea,

15:27.035 --> 15:30.035
teach him a lesson
he'll never forget.

15:30.035 --> 15:33.035
Whoa. Whoa.

15:33.035 --> 15:35.035
That's pretty harsh.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.035
<i>After my conversation
with Gloria,</i>

15:36.035 --> 15:38.035
<i>Richard escorted me out
and said</i>

15:38.035 --> 15:41.035
<i>that he no longer wanted my help
at Pink's.</i>

15:41.035 --> 15:43.035
<i>But when I make a promise
to a business...</i>

15:43.035 --> 15:46.035
I'm determined to protect
your brand at all costs.

15:46.035 --> 15:48.035
<i>I always keep it.</i>

15:48.035 --> 15:50.035
<i>And that meant I had
to show this guy on my own</i>

15:50.035 --> 15:53.035
<i>what happens
when you mess with Pink's.</i>

15:53.035 --> 15:55.035
<i>So using the number
from his appearance release,</i>

15:55.035 --> 15:58.035
<i>I told Jonathan I was calling
from the Pink's head office</i>

15:58.035 --> 16:00.035
<i>with some exciting news.</i>

16:00.035 --> 16:01.035
You, my friend,

16:01.035 --> 16:04.035
are the 10 millionth
Pink's customer.

16:07.035 --> 16:08.035
I am serious.

16:09.035 --> 16:13.035
You have won
a lobster lunch for one

16:13.035 --> 16:15.035
at sea.

16:17.035 --> 16:19.035
At sea.

16:22.035 --> 16:23.035
Congratulations.

16:23.035 --> 16:26.035
<i>Jonathan bought it
hook, line, and sinker.</i>

16:26.035 --> 16:28.035
<i>So I docked a boat
in the San Pedro harbor</i>

16:28.035 --> 16:31.035
<i>and then sent a limo
with two hired models</i>

16:31.035 --> 16:34.035
<i>to keep the ruse going
on the way to the sea.</i>

16:34.035 --> 16:35.035
I'm so excited to be

16:35.035 --> 16:38.035
the 10th millionth customer
of Pink's.

16:38.035 --> 16:39.035
I love their hot dogs.

16:39.035 --> 16:41.035
I'm so excited
to represent them.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.035
<i>Once Jonathan arrived, I had
him right where I needed him,</i>

16:44.691 --> 16:47.691
<i>and he was about to learn
that taking advantage of Pink's</i>

16:47.743 --> 16:49.035
<i>does not go unpunished.</i>

16:49.237 --> 16:51.582
<i>Shortly after,
we headed out to sea,</i>

16:51.766 --> 16:53.484
<i>and Jonathan
had no idea</i>

16:53.531 --> 16:56.035
<i>that his life
was about to change forever.</i>

16:59.983 --> 17:02.483
What's your personal tagline?

17:02.483 --> 17:05.483
Live life how you want
to live it and enjoy it...

17:05.483 --> 17:07.483
- Mm-hmm.
- Because no one

17:07.483 --> 17:08.483
is gonna--
no one can hurt you.

17:08.483 --> 17:10.483
- Don't answer to no one.
- Exactly.

17:10.483 --> 17:12.483
- Yeah.
- Do not answer to nobody.

17:12.483 --> 17:13.483
Yeah.

17:13.483 --> 17:14.483
I'm just so happy

17:15.193 --> 17:17.483
that the 10 millionth
Pink's customer

17:17.483 --> 17:20.483
turned out to be
such a selfless and honest guy.

17:20.483 --> 17:22.483
Yes.

17:22.483 --> 17:24.483
<i>Once we got
to deep enough waters,</i>

17:24.483 --> 17:26.483
<i>I led Jonathan
up to the top deck,</i>

17:26.483 --> 17:28.483
<i>where my plan
was about to unfold.</i>

17:28.483 --> 17:30.483
Have a seat
at your own personal table...

17:30.484 --> 17:33.483
- This is so gorgeous.
- out at sea.

17:33.483 --> 17:35.483
Huh?

17:35.483 --> 17:37.483
And here we go.

17:37.483 --> 17:39.483
I hope you're hungry

17:39.483 --> 17:40.483
for nothing.

17:40.483 --> 17:42.483
Now.

17:43.626 --> 17:45.483
<i>Hiding behind a curtain
were four of the people</i>

17:45.483 --> 17:47.483
<i>that Jonathan had callously
cut in front of</i>

17:47.483 --> 17:49.483
<i>to get
his hot dog first.</i>

17:49.483 --> 17:51.483
You're not
the 10 millionth customer.

17:51.483 --> 17:53.483
You're here today
because I know

17:53.483 --> 17:55.483
you didn't have
a doctor's appointment.

17:55.483 --> 17:58.483
I saw you
go into a movie theater.

17:58.483 --> 18:00.483
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

18:00.483 --> 18:04.483
And these are four people
that you cut in front of

18:04.483 --> 18:05.483
that you thought
you were better than,

18:05.483 --> 18:09.483
including
a nine-year-old girl.

18:09.483 --> 18:10.483
Don't be mad.

18:10.483 --> 18:13.483
I just don't understand
why you would cut us.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.483
I am truly sorry.
I'm really not like that.

18:15.483 --> 18:18.483
I'm not a liar. I mean,
even though I did say that,

18:18.483 --> 18:19.483
I was-- I was
under a lot of-- I-I just--

18:19.483 --> 18:21.483
He asked us
if we wanted to go,

18:21.483 --> 18:23.483
and he asked the guy behind us
if we had anything on the list,

18:23.483 --> 18:25.483
and we both said no.

18:25.483 --> 18:26.483
But, you know, I wasn't lying
when I said--

18:26.483 --> 18:28.483
And, yes, you were like,
"Oh, are you sure?

18:28.483 --> 18:29.483
I don't want to do it," and
this, that, and the other thing.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.483
- No, I did not.
- "Sure, go ahead."

18:30.483 --> 18:31.483
'cause we thought it was
a doctor's appointment,

18:31.483 --> 18:35.483
and we thought we were
being kind to a stranger

18:35.483 --> 18:37.483
who was in a hurry
and wanted to grab a bite to eat

18:37.483 --> 18:39.152
before the doctor's appointment.

18:39.215 --> 18:42.389
<i>Now that Jonathan understood
how his actions affected others,</i>

18:42.496 --> 18:44.483
<i>it was time
for his punishment.</i>

18:44.483 --> 18:46.483
<i>The initial plan
I had in mind</i>

18:46.483 --> 18:48.483
<i>was to unload all the passengers
except Jonathan</i>

18:48.483 --> 18:50.089
<i>into a second boat,</i>

18:50.217 --> 18:52.831
<i>and then sink the main boat
with Jonathan on it.</i>

18:52.997 --> 18:56.235
<i>But my legal department said
that this was too unsafe.</i>

18:56.483 --> 18:58.483
<i>So I reluctantly agreed
on a milder punishment.</i>

18:58.483 --> 19:00.483
You have to take
a piece of gum

19:00.483 --> 19:04.483
from this ordinary pack
of gum.

19:04.483 --> 19:06.483
What is that?

19:06.483 --> 19:10.483
It's just an ordinary pack
of gum.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.483
I'm not gonna do it.

19:12.483 --> 19:14.483
Jonathan, this is not
a negotiation.

19:14.483 --> 19:15.483
You did something wrong,

19:15.483 --> 19:18.483
and your punishment is
you have to take a piece of gum

19:18.483 --> 19:20.483
from this ordinary pack
of gum.

19:20.483 --> 19:21.483
Okay. I'm gonna turn around
while I do it.

19:21.483 --> 19:24.483
- Okay.
- I don't even want to see--

19:25.659 --> 19:27.483
Aah! That hurt.

19:27.483 --> 19:29.483
Yes. It wasn't
a normal pack of gum.

19:29.483 --> 19:31.483
It was
Shock Chewing Gum.

19:32.068 --> 19:34.036
<i>Now that he had paid
for his crime,</i>

19:34.108 --> 19:35.483
<i>I wanted to be sure
that Jonathan</i>

19:35.483 --> 19:37.483
<i>left this boat
a better man.</i>

19:37.483 --> 19:40.483
Inside all of our anatomies,
there's two parts.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.483
There's a part
that's a liar

19:42.483 --> 19:44.483
and a part
that's a cool guy.

19:44.483 --> 19:47.483
And you're letting
the part that's a liar

19:47.483 --> 19:49.483
take over your whole body.

19:49.483 --> 19:51.483
Deep down inside you,
Jonathan,

19:51.483 --> 19:54.483
I know
there's a good, cool guy.

19:54.483 --> 19:57.483
And I feel like
if you really work on yourself,

19:57.483 --> 20:00.483
within a few years,
you could even be the one

20:00.483 --> 20:01.483
trapping people on boats.

20:01.483 --> 20:04.483
Oh, my lord. Okay.

20:04.483 --> 20:06.483
You shouldn't be laughing
right now.

20:06.483 --> 20:08.483
No, but you're so weird.

20:08.483 --> 20:10.483
- No, Jonathan, I'm not weird.
- You are crazy.

20:10.483 --> 20:12.483
No, I'm normal.

20:12.483 --> 20:14.905
I teach people lessons
when they do something wrong.

20:15.023 --> 20:16.967
You're very manipulative
and conniving,

20:17.006 --> 20:18.374
and I don't like it.

20:18.405 --> 20:20.405
<i>Whether or not Jonathan
learned his lesson,</i>

20:20.483 --> 20:21.483
<i>I left that day knowing</i>

20:21.483 --> 20:23.546
<i>I had accomplished
something important.</i>

20:23.952 --> 20:26.436
<i>I upheld my promise
and returned dignity</i>

20:26.483 --> 20:28.483
<i>to the name
I vowed to protect</i>

20:28.483 --> 20:30.483
<i>by letting
the world know</i>

20:30.483 --> 20:32.483
<i>that this is what
was waiting for them</i>

20:32.483 --> 20:34.483
<i>if they decided
to [bleep] with Pink's.</i>
