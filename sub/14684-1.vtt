00:43.872 --> 00:45.822
<i>Dry land</i>

00:46.157 --> 00:48.605
<i>Quiet land of immense night</i>

00:49.551 --> 00:51.828
<i>Wind in the olive grove</i>

00:52.136 --> 00:53.714
<i>Wind in the Sierra</i>

00:59.791 --> 01:03.053
<i>For Salvador Dali,
of the olive-colored voice</i>

01:21.467 --> 01:22.618
Here we are, the three musketeers.

01:23.397 --> 01:24.743
Did you miss us?

01:25.817 --> 01:26.984
Luis Buñuel.

01:27.565 --> 01:30.551
It's Louie this term.
More chic, don't you think?

01:32.907 --> 01:33.647
Published?

01:33.650 --> 01:35.125
I signed it for you.

01:35.310 --> 01:38.461
And he would never have managed it
without your supportive comments.

01:38.751 --> 01:41.404
He's waisting his education with bad
company in disreputable night clubs.

01:41.987 --> 01:45.757
My parents were so pleased.
Thank you sir, thank you so much.

01:56.426 --> 01:58.236
<i>The soul of the west wind</i>

02:02.549 --> 02:04.093
- Just say what you want to say, Louie.
- What?

02:04.846 --> 02:08.670
I was having a lovely time reading about
all the butterflies and thrills...

02:09.243 --> 02:11.270
Oh, look! Here's God!

02:12.953 --> 02:15.323
It's just a bit... andalusian.

02:16.697 --> 02:17.749
I am andalusian.

02:18.058 --> 02:19.320
You know what I mean.

02:19.766 --> 02:20.987
You think it's bad.

02:21.143 --> 02:24.053
No, not the writing. The writing is
bloody good.

02:24.262 --> 02:25.971
It's the subject.

02:26.078 --> 02:30.825
What does Federico García Lorca feel
about all this bloody butterflies?

02:31.055 --> 02:32.156
What makes him angry?

02:32.497 --> 02:33.831
What turns him on?

02:36.542 --> 02:38.335
Oh, come on. Don't be such a prude.

02:38.857 --> 02:40.408
I am trying to be constructive here.

04:40.173 --> 04:42.962
... the other flag in between her leg...

04:45.218 --> 04:46.186
... and waived the flag...

04:46.563 --> 04:48.232
... it was a victory for...

06:30.904 --> 06:33.563
Holding all this brilliance isn't very
neighbourly, you know?

06:35.546 --> 06:36.247
Name?

06:37.382 --> 06:40.239
Salvador Felipe Jacinto Dalí Domenech.

06:40.812 --> 06:41.574
Studying?

06:42.685 --> 06:43.685
Fine art.

06:44.702 --> 06:45.563
Clearly.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.108
Interests?

06:47.735 --> 06:48.569
Affiliations?

06:51.017 --> 06:54.413
Only dada, anarchy and the
construction of genius.

06:55.487 --> 06:56.503
Whose genius?

06:57.105 --> 06:57.958
My own.

06:59.106 --> 06:59.979
Bravo.

07:01.586 --> 07:02.469
Luis Buñuel.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.232
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

07:06.913 --> 07:08.052
Excuse me for a moment.

07:11.268 --> 07:13.973
Private view at number seven!

07:14.859 --> 07:15.675
Where is everyone? Come on!

07:20.693 --> 07:21.819
This here... Sergio.

07:27.329 --> 07:29.977
Pechuga. Like it?

07:31.352 --> 07:33.819
Ah, look! A strategically placed
copy of Freud.

07:35.736 --> 07:37.885
Very good, very good, my friend.

08:01.503 --> 08:03.662
That's Federico, resident poet.

08:04.537 --> 08:06.021
García Lorca.

08:07.765 --> 08:10.013
He's famous.
- Really?

08:10.529 --> 08:12.110
I wonder if he knows.

08:12.982 --> 08:14.709
Come on, let's tell him. Federico!

08:15.242 --> 08:19.305
My new discovery. Salvador, may I
introduce you to resident poet,

08:20.548 --> 08:24.256
playwriter and another self-titled genius,
Federico García Lorca.

08:24.263 --> 08:26.316
We've met.

08:29.125 --> 08:30.818
You're a cubist.

08:30.845 --> 08:31.643
No.

08:32.534 --> 08:34.027
This is cubist.

08:36.491 --> 08:38.294
You're going to be something else?

08:38.966 --> 08:40.683
I'm putting together a magazine.

08:42.659 --> 08:44.421
Would you let us have this
for the cover?

08:51.633 --> 08:52.689
She is beautiful.

08:54.976 --> 08:56.084
She's dead.

08:57.775 --> 08:59.642
Federico, where have you been?

08:59.677 --> 09:01.079
Have you met Paco?

09:01.899 --> 09:04.253
- Hours ago.
- What have you been doing?

09:05.111 --> 09:06.594
Trying to find a subject.

09:07.537 --> 09:09.764
Louie thinks I'm a danger of
becoming bourgeois.

09:09.938 --> 09:12.290
Well, you've read the poems, apparently.
What do you think?

09:13.674 --> 09:15.042
I like them.

09:15.118 --> 09:17.715
Of course you like them, everybody
likes them.

09:18.226 --> 09:21.747
I just think you should write about
something modern. Something politics or...

09:22.124 --> 09:24.860
...the decapitation of the putrid priest
in Zaragoza or...

09:25.386 --> 09:26.170
Come on!

09:27.519 --> 09:29.928
- Eiffel tower.
- Sex!

09:32.380 --> 09:35.191
- Aeroplanes.
- Anything! Everything! Nothing!

09:44.119 --> 09:46.422
A recent acquisition?

09:46.601 --> 09:48.828
Salvador Felipe Jacinto Dalí Domenech.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.046
Catchy.

09:50.547 --> 09:52.882
New, but showing considerate promise.

09:53.574 --> 09:55.743
This is Adella.

09:57.267 --> 09:59.480
Federico the Famous,
where are the drinks?

10:03.911 --> 10:04.747
Federico!

10:08.544 --> 10:09.433
Your hair!

10:09.935 --> 10:11.847
- It's gone.
- It's wonderful.

10:13.459 --> 10:17.903
I'm very shocking, apparently, because my
grandfather refuses to let me in the house.

10:18.303 --> 10:20.162
Quite right. I wouldn't.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.628
I've missed you.

10:25.323 --> 10:29.244
The holidays were terrible! There was no one
here, nothing to regret!

10:29.279 --> 10:30.494
I read 80 books!

10:31.746 --> 10:32.737
80?

10:33.522 --> 10:34.519
40.

10:35.806 --> 10:37.062
10, actually.

10:38.326 --> 10:39.757
I've missed you, too.

10:43.828 --> 10:45.830
This is Salvador.

10:46.192 --> 10:49.482
He's just arrived. He's a painter,
a very good one.

10:49.954 --> 10:53.116
Well, ain't we lucky to have you.

11:05.383 --> 11:07.142
Champagne!

11:07.939 --> 11:09.928
You all live like kings!

11:10.632 --> 11:13.848
Surely, you're not suggesting
we live like students.

11:15.918 --> 11:17.238
Magdalena is a writer.

11:17.829 --> 11:19.188
At the women's college.

11:19.748 --> 11:21.209
- What do you write?
- I didn't tell you, did I?

11:21.976 --> 11:23.022
I'm getting an apartment!

11:23.456 --> 11:25.716
How will you ever get your parents to
agree to that?

11:25.866 --> 11:27.175
By not telling them.

11:27.761 --> 11:30.599
All lies are elaborate deceptions.

11:30.844 --> 11:32.306
Anyone got a match?

11:33.205 --> 11:35.127
Spain is rotting from the inside.

11:35.186 --> 11:38.497
Fated monarchy crash and dement our
religious culture

11:39.127 --> 11:41.672
Something has to give.. Look at
Russia!

11:41.945 --> 11:43.499
Look at Paris!

11:44.655 --> 11:47.623
Dance, my dove.
- I thought you'd never ask.

12:10.628 --> 12:12.889
Manuel de Torre.

12:14.565 --> 12:16.865
Great artist of the * idiot* people.

12:17.332 --> 12:19.627
Once told a singer

12:20.722 --> 12:22.324
<i>You have a voice</i>

12:24.743 --> 12:26.177
<i>You know the styles</i>

12:28.354 --> 12:30.347
<i>But you will never triumph in your art</i>

12:31.122 --> 12:33.584
<i>Because you have no...
'Duende.'</i>

12:34.997 --> 12:37.524
<i>A passion, on the very edge
of life and death.</i>

12:39.325 --> 12:43.714
Everywhere else in the world, death comes
and they draw the curtains.

12:44.969 --> 12:46.421
But not in Spain.

12:47.304 --> 12:52.643
In Spain... They open them.

12:57.164 --> 12:58.489
And I tell you this.

12:59.616 --> 13:03.395
There is no beginning and we do not
tremble.

13:04.904 --> 13:06.890
We are not sentimental.

13:08.141 --> 13:13.629
Like a furious wind, we rip at the fabric
of clouds and prayers.

13:14.802 --> 13:18.750
And we shape an epic spectacle.

13:20.139 --> 13:24.364
Of disaster, fire and decomposition.

13:24.401 --> 13:27.479
- Ideal, ideal, ideal.
- Knowledge, knowledge, knowledge!

13:33.794 --> 13:38.498
Dada! Now, that is what I call poetry.

13:39.632 --> 13:45.680
Yes, you know when I took the exam
for our art college..

13:45.705 --> 13:50.016
...I worked for three days on the drawing
and then I erased it.

13:50.420 --> 13:56.158
And I had one hour to get it right, just
imagine - one hour...

13:56.286 --> 13:58.399
.. and I gave it to our professors..

13:58.891 --> 14:01.577
... and they said "This painting..."...

14:02.019 --> 14:04.447
... "This painting, Salvador, it's"...

14:07.666 --> 14:09.479
No, no... Don't worry.

14:13.841 --> 14:17.446
They told me, this painting...

14:17.928 --> 14:19.664
"It's perfect."

14:27.129 --> 14:29.142
Whose idea was this?

14:29.946 --> 14:32.231
Federico's.
- No. He's your discovery.

14:40.164 --> 14:42.441
Faggots!

14:44.492 --> 14:46.848
Better hide! They're coming
to get you!

14:51.072 --> 14:53.879
They should be more careful.

14:54.257 --> 14:56.396
The boys are starting a gang,
do you know?

14:58.129 --> 15:00.393
Going to clean things up!

15:01.774 --> 15:03.198
Thinking of joining them?

15:04.816 --> 15:08.117
I prefer to see the marricones
locked away.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.572
He'll freeze.

15:51.706 --> 15:54.009
I can't stay here much longer, Federico.

15:54.460 --> 15:55.962
Can't breathe.

15:57.341 --> 16:00.226
We should be in Paris, mon ami.

16:00.514 --> 16:03.594
You can write, I can work
in a film studio...

16:03.822 --> 16:05.966
I thought you wanted to be
an entomologist.

16:06.076 --> 16:07.465
That was last term.

16:07.878 --> 16:09.459
And what about the boxing?

16:09.801 --> 16:11.570
I've always been persisten
about Paris.

16:16.167 --> 16:18.331
Well, anyway...

16:19.131 --> 16:20.332
I don't speak French.

16:20.596 --> 16:21.866
I'll buy you a book.

16:27.291 --> 16:29.120
I can't leave Spain, Louie.

16:29.350 --> 16:30.183
Why not?

16:33.465 --> 16:35.487
I hate new shoes.

16:39.114 --> 16:42.450
When I was a boy, in the Vega...
In the south...

16:46.693 --> 16:49.340
There was some trouble in a village
near our house

16:51.352 --> 16:52.749
There was always something.

16:55.306 --> 16:58.402
But the next thing we heard...
The Civil Guard...

16:58.454 --> 17:00.396
... had killed them all.

17:01.006 --> 17:02.490
The whole village.

17:03.580 --> 17:07.084
And I remember these carts,
full of bodies...

17:08.481 --> 17:10.077
All of the people laid out...

17:10.726 --> 17:12.194
... feet close together.

17:13.506 --> 17:15.010
Shiny shoes.

17:15.772 --> 17:17.445
As if they were resting.

17:19.977 --> 17:22.040
And sometimes, when I think about it...

17:22.558 --> 17:25.573
... it's as if everything around me,
all the people...

17:26.683 --> 17:28.300
... and the buildings...

17:29.757 --> 17:31.227
...and the animals...

17:32.149 --> 17:33.920
They are like pieces of cotton.

17:36.696 --> 17:38.735
And they just float away.

17:39.852 --> 17:42.659
And I'm alone.

17:44.308 --> 17:45.863
And that...

17:47.372 --> 17:48.544
...when I hear it...

17:50.997 --> 17:52.091
Death.

17:54.392 --> 17:56.670
Breathing behind of the wall.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.725
Death, rising up from my
new shoes.

18:04.386 --> 18:08.837
And there is nothing left... but the
grass and the grey sky.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.834
Now you tell me, Louie...

18:13.155 --> 18:15.382
... are those French thoughts?

19:35.738 --> 19:38.541
This fucking country!
I tell you, Federico, it breaks my heart.

19:39.675 --> 19:40.491
I know.

19:41.391 --> 19:42.841
This is why you must come with me.

19:42.842 --> 19:45.229
We have to be free to make
a difference to the world.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.769
What difference are you going to make
in a free country?

19:49.004 --> 19:51.023
The difference needs to be made here.

19:56.011 --> 19:58.521
- Sensational.
- Incredible.

20:00.105 --> 20:01.998
The girls will go crazy.

20:02.746 --> 20:03.906
I expect so.

20:04.054 --> 20:05.495
You don't do any sports, do you?

20:07.299 --> 20:09.956
I run most things.
Track, boxing...

20:10.389 --> 20:11.736
Fencing?

20:12.097 --> 20:13.552
Don't stretch a lot, I'm afraid.

20:13.889 --> 20:14.742
But, listen...

20:15.174 --> 20:18.511
I'm a part of this underground movement,
might be interesting for you - ultraism.

20:19.042 --> 20:22.257
We keep a low profile, wouldn't want
information getting into the wrong hands.

20:22.352 --> 20:24.729
Now come or we'll miss it!
- Where are we going?

20:25.251 --> 20:28.125
- Puppet show.
- A non-senzac puppet show.

20:42.966 --> 20:45.097
They complain to me about democracy...

20:46.446 --> 20:48.042
Ridiculous.

20:48.744 --> 20:51.821
Everyone in this city lives
in perfect liberty.

20:53.515 --> 20:55.670
Every single man and woman.

20:55.806 --> 20:56.940
Although...

20:57.019 --> 20:58.106
Of course...

20:58.128 --> 21:02.659
Women are free too, but in a slightly
different way.

21:04.103 --> 21:05.671
Look at the peasants.

21:06.035 --> 21:11.130
Why, I'd cut off my own leg to have half
as much liberty as the peasants.

21:11.832 --> 21:14.245
Just think, if the harvest is good...

21:14.294 --> 21:17.518
... they're free to give up over half their
crop for taxes...

21:17.882 --> 21:23.435
If the harvest is bad, why, they and their
family are completely free...

21:23.634 --> 21:25.228
... to starve to death.

21:33.346 --> 21:37.757
Holy Mother, forgive me, I have sinned.
I have had impure thoughts.

21:37.891 --> 21:40.530
Help me to resist temptation.

22:21.414 --> 22:24.952
So, once more - forget the rules!

22:25.392 --> 22:28.879
There is no science to art.
Feel the drawing!

22:29.065 --> 22:33.503
Interpret... Interpret and then draw
exactly what you see.

22:34.339 --> 22:39.636
See with your soul... See what you feel...
Express... Express...

23:01.369 --> 23:03.369
Mr. Dalí! Mr. Dalí!

23:04.366 --> 23:07.280
So... They won't publish me.

23:08.065 --> 23:11.743
They won't publish me unless I get
a male penname.

23:12.103 --> 23:14.515
I said to them, "I've got a name for you..."

23:14.903 --> 23:17.121
"Pope bloody Joan"

23:17.556 --> 23:21.141
They were so apologetic, so embarassed...

23:21.803 --> 23:26.629
"Miss Merra, if it were up to us, we'd hire
you on the spot, but the public college,

23:26.733 --> 23:29.131
to make a woman write and think about politics...
because of course...

23:29.653 --> 23:34.218
I should be at home, cooking for my
9 fat children and my impotent husband.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.742
It's just so frustrating, Federico.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.210
You could use my name,
as a penname.

23:42.405 --> 23:44.370
If it would help.

23:45.221 --> 23:48.482
That's probably the best offer anyone is
ever likely to make me, but...

23:48.803 --> 23:51.462
... I refuse to give into that bullying.

23:51.767 --> 23:55.382
I'll send them 20 letters a week, I'll
come to their offices...

23:55.706 --> 23:59.029
- Really... - You've forgotten your
hat. - And that's another thing...

23:59.383 --> 24:01.501
I despise hats!
- Listen...

24:02.076 --> 24:03.794
You don't need hats.

24:07.359 --> 24:10.090
Come on. Let's get this thing over with.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.301
Isn't that Salvador?

24:13.981 --> 24:15.926
Salvador!

24:25.140 --> 24:26.852
Can I have a look?

24:33.519 --> 24:36.725
- It's an experiment in perception.
- I see.

24:38.454 --> 24:39.497
It's fascinating.

24:40.150 --> 24:41.696
It's yours.

24:42.004 --> 24:44.222
No, no, no.
I couldn't.

24:44.937 --> 24:47.133
No, please. I insist.

24:47.552 --> 24:48.581
Thanks.

24:49.261 --> 24:52.267
I'll... I'll have it framed.

24:53.822 --> 24:55.410
So, where are you going?

24:56.564 --> 25:02.949
Federico is being very kind in agreeing to suffer
an evening of boring music and horrible company.

25:03.582 --> 25:08.031
My aunt's giving one of her legendarily dull
dinner parties. You must come!

25:08.944 --> 25:09.291
No.

25:09.292 --> 25:13.598
Yes! It's vital for my aunt
to know people like Salvador.

25:13.782 --> 25:15.180
You could show her you picture.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.931
But, you said it yourself,
it's going to be so boring...

25:18.372 --> 25:21.441
We don't want to subject poor Salvador.
- No, no, I...

25:22.045 --> 25:25.633
... I'd love to.
- You see? He'd love to come!

25:31.733 --> 25:33.395
Magdalena.

25:34.468 --> 25:37.341
What have you done to your hair?

25:37.937 --> 25:41.515
These are my friends, I'm going to
powder my nose...

25:44.014 --> 25:45.223
Federico García Lorca.

25:46.282 --> 25:50.735
- I'm so glad you could come.
- It's so kind of you to invite me.

25:51.575 --> 25:55.611
There are some very interesting people
for you to meet.

25:56.394 --> 26:01.066
Fernadno de Gavalle and, of course,
you must know señor Milagro.

26:01.531 --> 26:04.676
Magdalena's been talking about you
for so long...

26:04.945 --> 26:08.962
I had begun to wonder whether you
were another one of her inventions.

26:08.963 --> 26:09.765
Oh, no, no.

26:10.772 --> 26:15.577
Let me introduce you to... Salvador Dalí.
- How do you do?

26:16.321 --> 26:19.540
I'm trying to get very drunk,
thank you very much.

26:19.636 --> 26:21.532
I think soon I might be sick.

26:21.886 --> 26:24.264
You must be another writer?

26:24.815 --> 26:27.659
- No, Salvador is one of Madrid's famous painters.
- Oh.

26:29.008 --> 26:31.244
I recently escaped from prison.

26:32.161 --> 26:33.329
From prison?

26:34.838 --> 26:38.692
31 days of absolute incarceration.

26:38.900 --> 26:41.974
I found it, I find it very inspiring.

26:42.202 --> 26:48.531
How do you feel about communal defecation?
And the whiffles?

26:48.691 --> 26:53.706
So tremendously beneficial
for the complexion...

26:53.727 --> 26:58.114
He's upseting you, isn't he?
Come on, Salvador.

26:58.535 --> 27:00.354
Is it time for my bed, mother?

27:05.196 --> 27:06.765
Do excuse us.

27:22.630 --> 27:25.578
Fact remains, that these people
are not few people...

27:27.000 --> 27:33.745
They come over here,
living of our charity, stealing...

27:34.062 --> 27:37.991
It is essential to have a unformed
approach to the gypsies.

27:38.736 --> 27:41.767
Restore a certain autonomy
to the Civil Guard.

27:42.497 --> 27:44.277
Who are those unbearable men?

27:44.290 --> 27:48.624
The one that looks more
like a pig is señor Milagro.

27:49.110 --> 27:51.655
The other one is Fernando Gavalle.

27:52.327 --> 27:53.974
Why do I know the name?

27:54.009 --> 27:56.930
He's a little *idiot* from Madrid.
- Oh, my God!

27:58.387 --> 28:01.782
Senor García Lorca, you are from the
south, I believe?

28:02.134 --> 28:03.036
Yes.

28:03.072 --> 28:06.971
Well, then, you know better than anyone
what we are talking about here.

28:07.234 --> 28:13.685
And the youngest is 17 and she is engaged to
one of the Montana brothers...

28:15.050 --> 28:19.308
Bravo, bravo! Superb.
Superb!

28:20.741 --> 28:23.728
Oh, how avangard!

28:24.360 --> 28:25.820
Simply superb.

28:27.209 --> 28:28.890
How dare you?

28:31.101 --> 28:32.818
How dare I?

28:33.603 --> 28:37.789
How dare you, sir? Then you clearly don't know
who I am. I am Salvador Dalí!

28:38.149 --> 28:39.719
The saviour of modern art.

28:40.962 --> 28:44.723
And this man is a genius.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.610
He's a great poet.

28:46.764 --> 28:49.830
Aren't we honoured, ladies and gentlemen?

28:49.865 --> 28:54.403
Saviour of modern art and his friend,
great poet.

28:54.684 --> 28:56.344
Recite something.

28:56.623 --> 28:58.224
No.

28:58.411 --> 29:00.376
Oh, yes, do.

29:00.842 --> 29:01.868
I'm sorry.

29:02.143 --> 29:03.752
I don't have anything.

29:04.058 --> 29:06.225
- Go on.
- It's not suitable.

29:06.625 --> 29:09.537
Federico. Fuck suitable.

29:09.900 --> 29:12.919
Well, come on then, great poet.

29:13.770 --> 29:15.588
Sing for your supper.

29:28.947 --> 29:30.781
<i>Oh city of the gypsies</i>

29:31.420 --> 29:33.371
<i>Who could see you and not remember you</i>

29:34.208 --> 29:36.496
<i>City of musk and sorrow</i>

29:36.682 --> 29:38.436
<i>City of cinnamon towers</i>

29:40.169 --> 29:42.023
<i>Oh, city of the gypsies</i>

29:42.058 --> 29:43.877
<i>Corners hung with flags</i>

29:44.923 --> 29:47.044
<i>Put your green lights out</i>

29:47.600 --> 29:49.763
<i>The Civil Guard is coming</i>

29:51.219 --> 29:53.626
<i>The city, free of fear</i>

29:53.802 --> 29:55.690
<i>Was multiplying doors</i>

29:56.232 --> 29:58.107
<i>Forty Civil guardsmen</i>

29:58.142 --> 30:00.577
<i>Pour through to sack and burn</i>

30:01.757 --> 30:05.695
<i>Flight of long screams rose
from the weathercocks.</i>

30:06.583 --> 30:11.237
<i>Sabre slashed the breezes
trampled under hoof</i>

30:14.671 --> 30:17.432
<i>Through the half-lit streets</i>

30:17.789 --> 30:19.247
<i>Old gypsy women</i>

30:19.282 --> 30:20.519
<i>Flee</i>

30:21.119 --> 30:22.548
<i>With their sleepy horses</i>

30:22.557 --> 30:24.862
<i>And enormous jars of coins</i>

30:25.569 --> 30:29.782
<i>Up the steep streets
climbed the sinister capes</i>

30:30.591 --> 30:33.710
<i>Leaving behind them brief
whirlwinds of shears</i>

30:36.495 --> 30:41.308
<i>Oh, city of the gypsies!
The Civil guardsmen ride away</i>

30:41.774 --> 30:43.734
<i>Through a tunnel of silence</i>

30:45.047 --> 30:48.517
<i>While the flames encircle you</i>

31:08.012 --> 31:09.529
Let's get out of here, hm?

31:12.460 --> 31:14.387
Viva la revolucion!

31:52.407 --> 31:57.998
Federico, when I saw you at the dinner...
When you read your poem...

32:00.149 --> 32:02.400
I saw what you really are.

32:05.061 --> 32:07.830
You're... Raw.

32:08.514 --> 32:11.183
Like some animal that's been skinned.

32:18.303 --> 32:20.066
So, what's she like?

32:20.294 --> 32:21.295
Who?

32:23.269 --> 32:24.933
Magdalena, you know.

32:25.697 --> 32:26.842
No.

32:27.244 --> 32:28.033
What?

32:31.304 --> 32:32.399
What about with other girls?

32:33.416 --> 32:33.944
Oh.

32:34.663 --> 32:37.036
You mean...
- Yeah.

32:38.551 --> 32:41.933
Not with Magdalena, but back home...

32:42.975 --> 32:43.763
Really?

32:44.367 --> 32:45.680
Haven't you?

32:48.915 --> 32:50.074
I've had a few.

32:59.254 --> 33:03.068
All the institutions that prop up this corrupt
regime must be dismount!

33:04.523 --> 33:06.579
I just think it sounds a bit extreme.

33:06.770 --> 33:09.899
But it has to be extreme, Paco.
It has to be complete revolution!

33:10.009 --> 33:12.136
All the churches, all the palaces!

33:13.320 --> 33:14.864
You know, when I was small...

33:16.383 --> 33:19.069
There was this ruined tower near our house,
in Cadaques.

33:19.583 --> 33:20.902
You'll see it when you come.

33:21.812 --> 33:22.999
I'm coming?

33:24.467 --> 33:26.086
Of course, with the holidays...

33:28.345 --> 33:29.997
You must come.

33:30.539 --> 33:32.843
I would sit in this tower and I draw,
draw and draw.

33:33.658 --> 33:35.060
I never came down.

33:35.703 --> 33:39.488
Just imagine this little shrimp of a child,
half-starved, covered in piss.

33:40.861 --> 33:43.775
And I wouldn't come down in
the winter, in the summer.

33:43.776 --> 33:46.901
In the freezing cold, I'd fill
this iron tub with water...

33:47.995 --> 33:49.564
I'd sit in it for days.

33:50.509 --> 33:55.189
It's even then I realized that if I'm going
to be anything more than...

33:55.370 --> 33:59.233
... than average, if anyone is going to
remember me...

33:59.667 --> 34:02.743
... then I need to go further in everything.

34:02.975 --> 34:04.926
In art. In life.

34:05.511 --> 34:10.614
And everything that they think is real,
morality, immorality, good, bad...

34:11.764 --> 34:15.284
I... We have to smash that to pieces.

34:15.684 --> 34:17.271
And we have to go beyond that.

34:18.731 --> 34:20.917
We have to be brave, Federico.

34:23.889 --> 34:25.303
No limit.

34:26.880 --> 34:27.998
No, no limit.

34:33.254 --> 34:34.304
What do you think you're doing?

34:34.748 --> 34:35.802
What?

34:36.370 --> 34:38.485
I saw you. I bloody saw you!

34:38.714 --> 34:39.893
You had your hand on her leg!

34:40.831 --> 34:41.998
Are you denying that?

34:46.266 --> 34:49.059
Get off me! I can fight my own battles!

35:53.335 --> 35:54.326
Federico.

35:56.090 --> 35:56.576
No.

36:54.596 --> 36:55.422
Look.

37:05.701 --> 37:06.794
It's beautiful.

39:28.829 --> 39:31.264
I've never seen anything like this before.

39:32.968 --> 39:35.587
It has all the tones of Tangi, but...

39:36.680 --> 39:39.132
I think it's something new.

39:40.530 --> 39:42.175
It's extraordinary.

39:45.173 --> 39:46.460
Me!

39:48.684 --> 39:50.988
You can name it, if you want.

39:54.140 --> 39:55.657
"Little Ashes".

39:57.137 --> 40:02.431
Because you can paint us into hundred pictures.
And in eighty years time...

40:02.862 --> 40:04.499
We'll still be dust.

40:09.683 --> 40:12.245
We'll still be in the pictures.

40:12.513 --> 40:13.305
Not us.

40:13.643 --> 40:16.599
We'll be echoes of ourselves.

40:16.635 --> 40:17.844
Ghosts.

40:19.737 --> 40:21.874
And I don't want to be a ghost.

40:24.032 --> 40:25.953
Come with me to Granada.

40:26.981 --> 40:27.966
I can't.

40:28.018 --> 40:30.490
You'll see my family, my home.

40:31.770 --> 40:33.363
Everything I am.

40:37.613 --> 40:40.119
I see you now, Federico.

41:02.629 --> 41:07.921
<i>The afternoon gone mad
with figs and heated sounds</i>

41:13.702 --> 41:17.722
<i>Falls upon the rider's wounded thighs.</i>

41:21.134 --> 41:24.888
<i>Black angels were flying
on the western breeze.</i>

41:28.659 --> 41:33.459
<i>Angels with long braids and hearts
of soothing oil.</i>

44:56.443 --> 44:57.556
Good night.

45:00.022 --> 45:01.309
Good night.

46:28.694 --> 46:29.613
Salvador.

46:30.225 --> 46:34.534
I think of you and I've never thought
more intensly in my life.

46:35.739 --> 46:37.761
Since our time together...

46:37.913 --> 46:40.465
... everything I am has been split apart.

46:40.483 --> 46:44.494
I write in a way that I've never
thought possible.

46:45.892 --> 46:48.548
My pen scratches the surface
of things.

46:48.685 --> 46:52.352
The masks... And then it goes
beyond them.

46:52.832 --> 46:54.601
Right down to the bones.

46:54.929 --> 46:58.744
Downt to the dark, cold jelly in the
marrow.

47:03.874 --> 47:04.949
Federico.

47:05.787 --> 47:07.559
From the day you left...

47:07.930 --> 47:09.952
... I've been in the studio day and night.

47:10.664 --> 47:13.149
I started to work on designs for
your play.

47:13.895 --> 47:15.743
I'm doing them gypsy-style.

47:15.871 --> 47:17.114
Andalusian.

47:17.410 --> 47:18.447
Like you.

47:19.563 --> 47:21.917
The unconscious mind, Federico...

47:22.033 --> 47:24.412
... it rises like a beast within me.

47:24.883 --> 47:27.866
I let it speak and it produces such
wonders.

47:32.749 --> 47:33.856
It's true.

47:33.891 --> 47:36.171
I touch sea bottom in myself.

47:36.801 --> 47:38.590
And my poems write themselves.

47:38.713 --> 47:41.393
I am, just as you said...

47:41.455 --> 47:42.192
Raw.

47:42.216 --> 47:43.408
Bloody.

47:43.750 --> 47:44.515
Alive.

47:44.889 --> 47:47.224
And I, too, want to be alive.

48:27.644 --> 48:29.020
How did you get in?

48:32.407 --> 48:33.833
I stole your key.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.610
It's going to look superb.

48:41.399 --> 48:44.763
No.
It will be superb.

48:46.126 --> 48:51.561
After Barcelona, we should take it to London and
Paris and then New York.

48:52.394 --> 48:53.628
Why not?

48:54.733 --> 48:56.804
No limits.

49:00.361 --> 49:02.191
So why did you come back so early?

49:07.041 --> 49:09.479
You know what you said in your letter?

49:10.764 --> 49:17.212
About everything that you
are being split apart?

49:37.583 --> 49:39.161
Louie.

49:39.196 --> 49:41.090
What an amazing surprise.

49:42.134 --> 49:43.402
What are you talking about?

49:44.710 --> 49:46.281
I didn't know when you'll be getting back.

49:47.220 --> 49:48.826
You didn't say when you were coming.

49:48.881 --> 49:50.260
Are you feeling alright?

49:51.566 --> 49:53.421
Salutations, Mr. Dalí.

49:55.461 --> 49:56.816
Sit down, sit down.

49:57.412 --> 49:59.108
Would you like some tea?

50:01.324 --> 50:03.129
Your look.

50:03.258 --> 50:03.879
Sorry?

50:08.812 --> 50:09.718
What are these?

50:11.637 --> 50:14.231
Set designs for Mariana Pineda.
You know, my play.

50:14.817 --> 50:16.080
To be performed?

50:16.246 --> 50:18.965
In Barcelona. Salvador's father got us
a producer.

50:20.411 --> 50:22.313
That's... excellent news.

50:23.560 --> 50:24.792
You're doing the sets?

50:25.012 --> 50:26.565
Nothing wrong with that, is there?

50:27.575 --> 50:29.374
I didn't say there was.

50:37.012 --> 50:39.300
How's my new screenplay coming?

50:44.173 --> 50:45.253
My short film.

50:45.338 --> 50:47.037
The one I asked you to write about.

50:47.589 --> 50:51.040
Yes, of course. I haven't had much time
recently, so when I...

50:51.057 --> 50:52.028
Don't worry about it.

50:55.797 --> 50:57.275
Federico...

50:58.433 --> 51:00.478
Let's play the "putrescent" game.

51:01.204 --> 51:02.051
The what?

51:02.629 --> 51:06.087
It's "putrescent".
It's my new word.

51:06.594 --> 51:08.022
Meaning?

51:09.962 --> 51:12.206
Outdated, outmoded.

51:12.289 --> 51:14.427
Generally out, then.

51:15.759 --> 51:17.011
Yes, generally.

51:20.468 --> 51:24.048
Come on, Ferry.
You have to hear these putrescences Federico does...

51:24.402 --> 51:28.198
They're histerical. They're...
- Yes, come on, Ferry!

51:29.481 --> 51:34.772
Look. Let's skip the tea, let's run out and
have some dinner.

51:37.232 --> 51:38.478
What shall I wear?

51:41.589 --> 51:42.413
The blue.

51:44.168 --> 51:45.700
I don't like the blue.

51:46.797 --> 51:47.735
What about the grey, then?

51:49.136 --> 51:50.566
Oh, I love the grey, yeah.
Ok.

51:56.303 --> 51:58.510
I went to see that play with Jorge.

51:58.672 --> 51:59.359
Which one?

51:59.851 --> 52:00.993
Jorge is a worm.

52:01.055 --> 52:02.117
"Salome".

52:02.209 --> 52:06.439
- Oscar Wilde. I thought they banned it.
- He's a faggot.

52:06.693 --> 52:07.887
Marricon.

52:08.018 --> 52:09.989
Unproved by all accounts.

52:10.359 --> 52:12.893
Not Wilde, Jorge.

52:12.997 --> 52:14.457
He's got a girlfriend.

52:15.187 --> 52:17.557
Oh, come on! He screams "queer"
from every orifice.

52:17.702 --> 52:21.347
- Keep your voice down, Louie.
- Oh, we should all keep quiet, should we, Adella?

52:21.527 --> 52:22.346
Well, I won't!

52:22.347 --> 52:23.984
- For god's sake...
- No!

52:24.304 --> 52:28.353
Because it is illegal. And it is illegal because
it is immoral. And I tell you...

52:28.966 --> 52:32.153
They should get more then 15 years
hard bloody labour for it.

52:33.748 --> 52:37.686
I never thought I'd see the day that Luis Buñuel
gave us a lecture on morality.

52:39.553 --> 52:41.609
- Dance with me.
- "Dance with me".

52:42.022 --> 52:44.649
- That's enough.
- Don't bother, Federico.

52:44.951 --> 52:46.537
Oh, I'm sorry, Magdalena.

52:46.565 --> 52:50.609
Did I offend your vaginal sensibilities?
- Leave her alone.

52:52.086 --> 52:54.650
Look at the big, brave Federico.

52:55.499 --> 52:56.676
What a man.

52:56.952 --> 52:59.740
- You are drunk.
- You don't say.

53:09.935 --> 53:12.412
Things have certainly changed around here,
my friend.

53:14.968 --> 53:15.933
What do you mean?

53:17.586 --> 53:18.880
It's the college.

53:19.389 --> 53:20.845
Staying on, year after year.

53:20.846 --> 53:23.601
Studying this and that
until you blew in the face.

53:24.530 --> 53:27.724
It is a fantasy land for
spoiled school kids.

53:28.105 --> 53:29.224
Look at Federico.

53:29.511 --> 53:31.513
Oh, I know. He's doing well.

53:31.839 --> 53:33.622
Plays, whatever.

53:33.870 --> 53:37.702
In Paris, they would do a fuck up
at his work.

53:38.365 --> 53:44.920
It's... What's your word?
Putrescent.

53:47.729 --> 53:51.776
Federico is working on something now.

53:52.184 --> 53:53.920
That will blow everything apart.

53:54.292 --> 53:55.692
What's it about?

53:55.729 --> 53:57.095
His family?

53:57.187 --> 53:58.340
Butterflies?

53:58.515 --> 53:59.325
God?

54:02.306 --> 54:03.349
Me.

54:13.334 --> 54:15.105
It'll be sentimental rubbish.

54:16.723 --> 54:18.659
Always has been, always will be.

54:21.963 --> 54:26.049
Still, if you go around
behaving like that...

54:27.648 --> 54:29.504
...then you have to expect it.

54:31.145 --> 54:32.334
Look.

54:33.250 --> 54:35.593
You don't have to say anything.

54:36.601 --> 54:38.412
But you should really get away from here.

54:39.692 --> 54:41.531
In Paris, with your talents...

54:41.532 --> 54:43.676
You could set the place on fire!

54:45.652 --> 54:47.237
I'm leaving tomorrow.

54:48.510 --> 54:49.897
What? Why?

54:50.598 --> 54:52.107
It's over here.

54:52.531 --> 54:54.370
Everything's gone.

54:56.113 --> 54:57.997
To your word.

55:01.745 --> 55:07.159
Now this is more like it! Come on, Dalí.
Shake a leg!

55:25.940 --> 55:26.622
It's five o' clock.

55:29.914 --> 55:30.800
What's that?

55:34.345 --> 55:37.709
The revolutionary Dali communicator!

55:38.111 --> 55:39.712
I'll be a millionaire!

55:40.199 --> 55:41.726
I'll buy shares.

55:54.589 --> 55:55.609
Which hand?

55:57.653 --> 55:58.641
Left.

56:00.168 --> 56:00.828
For you.

56:01.074 --> 56:02.495
And

56:06.064 --> 56:06.835
For you.

56:43.597 --> 56:44.507
Where are you going?

56:45.558 --> 56:46.558
To the bathroom.

56:47.242 --> 56:48.101
With your diary?

58:04.263 --> 58:05.293
<i>If I became a fish?</i>

58:06.336 --> 58:08.311
<i>I'd change into the grave.</i>

58:08.860 --> 58:10.957
<i>If I became the grass?</i>

58:11.992 --> 58:13.120
<i>Change into water.</i>

58:13.843 --> 58:15.553
<i>If a became an angel?</i>

58:17.108 --> 58:19.041
<i>I'd change into an eye.</i>

58:19.581 --> 58:21.452
<i>And if I became an eye?</i>

58:21.792 --> 58:24.770
<i>I'd turn into a knife.
Then I'd cut you to pieces.</i>

59:08.958 --> 59:11.786
<i>Salvador Dali, with your
olive-colored voice...</i>

59:12.297 --> 59:13.380
It's genius.

59:14.206 --> 59:15.498
I mean, everybody says it is.

59:16.498 --> 59:19.659
Tell me the bit about the bicycles, again.

59:34.080 --> 59:37.428
<i>I sing your restless longing for the statue</i>

59:38.020 --> 59:41.072
<i>Your fear of the feeling,
that await you in the street</i>

59:42.527 --> 59:45.498
<i>I sing the small sea siren who sings to you</i>

59:45.876 --> 59:48.621
<i>Riding her bicycle of corals and conches</i>

59:49.161 --> 59:50.462
<i>But above all</i>

59:51.090 --> 59:52.774
<i>I sing a common thought</i>

59:53.792 --> 59:56.394
<i>That joins us in the dark and golden hours</i>

01:00:01.362 --> 01:00:04.167
<i>The light that blinds our eyes is not art</i>

01:00:05.647 --> 01:00:07.398
<i>Rather it is love.</i>

01:00:08.676 --> 01:00:09.468
<i>Friendship.</i>

01:00:11.126 --> 01:00:12.995
<i>Crossed swords.</i>

01:00:13.366 --> 01:00:14.988
I don't like that line.

01:00:15.688 --> 01:00:16.558
Thanks.

01:00:19.284 --> 01:00:20.777
I love the rest of it.

01:00:21.799 --> 01:00:22.473
Do you?

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:24.892
Yes.

01:01:12.893 --> 01:01:13.527
Look at me.

01:01:14.016 --> 01:01:15.695
Look at me, Salvador.

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:16.499
Look at me.

01:01:23.952 --> 01:01:25.007
You see?

01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:44.735
No limit.

01:02:14.104 --> 01:02:14.888
Sorry.

01:02:35.924 --> 01:02:37.257
It doesn't matter.

01:02:39.514 --> 01:02:40.893
It's not important.

01:02:46.978 --> 01:02:48.399
It's late.

01:02:48.537 --> 01:02:49.959
You should sleep.

01:02:51.603 --> 01:02:54.163
We'll go for a breakfast at the"Pelican".

01:02:54.393 --> 01:02:56.194
And you'll paint all afternoon.

01:03:06.308 --> 01:03:07.178
Salvador.

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.732
What do you see, when...?

01:03:15.415 --> 01:03:16.505
You can tell me.

01:03:18.337 --> 01:03:19.800
You can tell me anything.

01:03:27.451 --> 01:03:29.035
I'm going to Paris.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.594
What?

01:03:32.231 --> 01:03:33.833
I'm going to go and see Louie.

01:03:39.642 --> 01:03:43.171
He'll introduce me to... Picasso.

01:03:44.284 --> 01:03:46.347
And the surrealists and...

01:03:49.616 --> 01:03:51.326
He'll take me to nightclubs.

01:03:53.474 --> 01:03:57.265
I'm going now.
Don't...

01:03:58.261 --> 01:04:01.843
Don't, don't try to stop me.
- Why would I try? Salvador!

01:05:13.064 --> 01:05:14.282
Federico!

01:05:18.376 --> 01:05:20.132
Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

01:05:20.552 --> 01:05:23.516
- What happened?
- Nothing, nothing.

01:05:24.537 --> 01:05:28.102
I just... I need some air.

01:05:45.535 --> 01:05:48.901
- I wanted to tell you, but it was
going to be a surprise...

01:05:51.249 --> 01:05:53.196
I got a job at the Tribune.

01:05:54.321 --> 01:05:57.776
- That's wonderful.
- I know, can you believe it?

01:05:58.464 --> 01:06:02.012
Anyway, it starts in a month, so...

01:06:02.217 --> 01:06:05.189
I'm taking a break, I'm going to Italy.

01:06:05.576 --> 01:06:08.666
And I thought, maybe you'd like to come.

01:06:09.603 --> 01:06:14.037
You could write, I could write and
you need to get away anyway, so...

01:06:14.038 --> 01:06:14.544
Hey.

01:06:17.804 --> 01:06:19.084
What are you doing here?

01:06:20.984 --> 01:06:22.496
It's a great spectacle, isn't it?

01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:25.019
Everyone's here.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.070
How was Paris?

01:06:28.411 --> 01:06:30.716
I didn't know when you were coming back.

01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:33.727
Today.

01:06:35.553 --> 01:06:37.464
I have an examination.

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:42.155
Federico?

01:06:43.674 --> 01:06:44.746
I should go, too.

01:06:46.275 --> 01:06:47.170
Okay.

01:06:47.999 --> 01:06:49.362
I'll stay.

01:06:50.077 --> 01:06:53.714
What were you saying before? Something
about Italy, I don't know.

01:06:56.573 --> 01:06:58.826
Nothing.

01:07:11.601 --> 01:07:15.323
You have 20 minutes to deliver an oral
critique of Raphael.

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:17.194
You may begin.

01:07:22.607 --> 01:07:23.594
Mr. Dalí?

01:07:27.003 --> 01:07:28.635
Gentlemen...

01:07:29.127 --> 01:07:34.335
I returned from Paris with
a conclusion that...

01:07:34.931 --> 01:07:42.590
The entire amount of real, artistic knowledge
contained within this panel of professors...

01:07:42.596 --> 01:07:45.059
... is not equal to one half of this.

01:07:46.513 --> 01:07:48.348
This - my fingernail.

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:50.197
Not one half, gentlemen.

01:07:51.316 --> 01:07:55.059
And I've been insulting myself
by letting your shruddy practices,

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:57.157
your pathetic, outdated theories...

01:07:57.158 --> 01:08:00.204
... and questionable characters
shit on my genious.

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:05.526
I hope with all my heart that you'll
realize I'm right and...

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:09.955
Give up this foolishness and go back
to the pigsties and the haystacks,

01:08:09.956 --> 01:08:12.005
where you might be of some real use.

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.968
Magdalena.

01:08:30.636 --> 01:08:31.703
I know.

01:08:34.008 --> 01:08:36.130
I know, Adella.

01:08:39.912 --> 01:08:42.425
I have to do something.

01:08:48.975 --> 01:08:50.215
Could you...

01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:55.513
Could you lend me something?

01:08:56.249 --> 01:08:59.764
A dress, to make me irresistible?

01:09:14.804 --> 01:09:16.091
Would you like some tea?

01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:19.077
Tea? Only *idiots* drink tea.

01:09:20.109 --> 01:09:22.072
I'm surprised we don't drown in the shit.

01:09:26.205 --> 01:09:27.877
So, you got back yesterday?

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:31.170
Federico, what does yesterday matter?

01:09:31.943 --> 01:09:36.022
Yesterday... I didn't exist.
Yesterday is nothing.

01:09:36.612 --> 01:09:39.907
Today, this moment and the bright and
glorious future.

01:09:40.618 --> 01:09:41.656
I'm sorry.

01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:43.740
I'm a bit confused.

01:09:44.408 --> 01:09:47.484
So, Salvador. Who are you pretending
to be today?

01:09:48.006 --> 01:09:48.942
Why?

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:52.113
Well, is it Salvador?

01:09:52.764 --> 01:09:55.532
The extreme anarchist who's only
escaped from prison?

01:09:55.869 --> 01:09:58.538
Or Salvador Dali,
the genius artist of Madrid?

01:09:59.281 --> 01:10:01.567
Or Salvador, the lover...
- Listen to me.

01:10:02.249 --> 01:10:06.586
An agent came from
Paris to see my new work.

01:10:06.587 --> 01:10:11.019
The canvases from
Cadaques and he loved them.

01:10:11.481 --> 01:10:14.151
He called me the most exciting young
artist in Spain.

01:10:16.383 --> 01:10:20.599
So, now - goodbye, Spain!

01:10:21.315 --> 01:10:23.126
Goodbye, Madrid!

01:10:24.121 --> 01:10:27.857
And Paris... Paris - toujours!

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:38.041
Louie introduced me to Picasso and there was
this extraordinary man...

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.140
Who gave me a photograph of his wife...

01:10:43.862 --> 01:10:45.437
... and, she's naked.

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:48.630
You won't believe this.

01:10:52.963 --> 01:10:54.926
Gala. Galushka.

01:10:58.446 --> 01:11:01.771
She's Russian.
She's my twin soul.

01:11:02.484 --> 01:11:04.788
I've dreamt of this woman my whole life.

01:11:05.302 --> 01:11:08.467
When I have her,
nothing will be able to stop me.

01:11:09.281 --> 01:11:10.858
I'll bring Paris to its knees.

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:14.330
King... King Salvador!

01:11:15.218 --> 01:11:20.047
You should've seen Louie, he's
asking me to make his first film with him...

01:11:20.053 --> 01:11:20.782
- Salvador!
- ...and the surrealists and impressionists...

01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:22.714
When I go back, they
won't know what's hit them.

01:11:22.715 --> 01:11:25.830
The ideas, I've got it, it's
coming, I can taste it...

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:28.066
- What's coming?
- I need to go to Cadaques to prepare...

01:11:28.433 --> 01:11:30.702
- What do you mean? Your father said...
- My father said what?

01:11:31.649 --> 01:11:33.470
I got expelled!

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.692
My father can go fuck himself!

01:11:37.038 --> 01:11:41.920
- From this point on, my real life begins.
- Your real life? And what about this life?

01:11:42.287 --> 01:11:44.756
- You can't just abandon everything!
- Abandon what?

01:11:45.171 --> 01:11:50.259
Sitting in an art room all day,
going out of my mind with boredom?

01:11:50.619 --> 01:11:54.063
Drinking myself into a stupor every night?

01:11:54.730 --> 01:11:57.317
I'm so sick of it!
- How can you say that?

01:11:58.477 --> 01:12:00.354
Your painting's never been better.

01:12:02.889 --> 01:12:06.267
This isn't you, Salvador.
What's happened to you?

01:12:10.137 --> 01:12:13.957
- Why can't you just be happy for me?
- Happy for you?

01:12:14.587 --> 01:12:21.130
You're just selfish,
like Louie says...

01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:26.085
You're a selfish fuckin' marricon.

01:12:26.923 --> 01:12:30.448
Oh, really? And what exactly does that
make you?

01:13:04.577 --> 01:13:06.446
I can't.

01:13:14.145 --> 01:13:15.824
Federico!

01:13:18.582 --> 01:13:19.899
Let her in.

01:13:28.727 --> 01:13:30.664
Sleeping?

01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:46.838
You look as if you are still dreaming.

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:57.194
- Magdalena.
- Just for now... Just this once.

01:14:09.054 --> 01:14:10.994
Don't worry about anything, just...

01:17:10.004 --> 01:17:11.082
Salvador?

01:17:47.774 --> 01:17:50.061
<i>There are very few angels who sing</i>

01:17:50.733 --> 01:17:52.975
<i>There are very few dogs who bark</i>

01:17:54.502 --> 01:17:58.074
<i>A thousand violins fit
in the palm of my hand</i>

01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:03.344
<i>But, the weeping is an enormous dog</i>

01:18:03.604 --> 01:18:06.391
<i>The weeping is an enormous angel</i>

01:18:07.583 --> 01:18:10.311
<i>The weeping is an enormous violin</i>

01:18:10.581 --> 01:18:13.120
<i>Tears have muzzled the wind</i>

01:18:14.085 --> 01:18:17.221
<i>And nothing's heard, but the weeping</i>

01:19:54.161 --> 01:19:55.557
Coffee, please.

01:20:01.058 --> 01:20:03.796
Why they've made this film?

01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:07.901
Do you know what they called it?
"An andalusian dog".

01:20:09.161 --> 01:20:10.429
I don't think they...

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:14.777
Well, I do. I mean,
I'm from where exactly?

01:20:16.227 --> 01:20:18.496
Do they even know anyone
else from Andalucia?

01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:22.547
Listen, you need a complete break.

01:20:23.007 --> 01:20:27.287
Everyone says so. What about your idea for
the travelling theatre?

01:20:27.482 --> 01:20:28.522
You should go.

01:20:29.604 --> 01:20:31.715
Get out of Madrid for a while.

01:20:32.086 --> 01:20:34.478
Get on with your life, Federico.

01:20:38.294 --> 01:20:40.183
Have you spoken to him?

01:20:41.115 --> 01:20:42.908
Have you spoken to Salvador?

01:20:43.209 --> 01:20:45.295
I've tried to talk to him...

01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:46.830
In letters.

01:20:48.778 --> 01:20:51.467
He won't...

01:20:51.472 --> 01:20:55.463
He took Luis to Cadaqes.
I saw their pictures in the paper.

01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:59.939
And apparently, he's got this woman.

01:20:59.976 --> 01:21:01.931
This Gala woman.

01:21:03.102 --> 01:21:05.773
God knows what he does with her.

01:21:06.841 --> 01:21:07.817
Sorry.

01:21:08.481 --> 01:21:13.371
It' just... It's as if nothing ever
happened.

01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:20.337
Sometimes I feel we've never
even met.

01:21:20.498 --> 01:21:23.365
- I'm so sorry, Federico.
- No.

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.563
I'm the one who should be sorry.

01:21:27.192 --> 01:21:30.256
I can't let you take the blame for that.

01:21:30.295 --> 01:21:34.228
Magdalena, please understand.
There is no one I'd rather be with.

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:38.721
If we had a choice in
these things, which we don't.

01:21:38.722 --> 01:21:39.543
Don't we?

01:21:45.816 --> 01:21:48.144
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy,

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:51.431
but I don't think you
can carry on like this.

01:21:52.904 --> 01:21:57.436
I mean, you can. Of course you can,
but it has a price.

01:21:59.312 --> 01:22:04.542
I think sometimes we just have to risk it.
Live the way we feel.

01:22:06.644 --> 01:22:09.896
And you know, it might not turn out well...

01:22:10.948 --> 01:22:13.334
... sometimes it doesn't
turn out well at all.

01:22:14.559 --> 01:22:19.081
But we have to try.
We have to keep on trying.

01:22:22.558 --> 01:22:25.141
Otherwise, we just become puppets.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:28.485
All painted smiles, bare inside.

01:22:29.049 --> 01:22:30.646
Nothing.

01:22:31.205 --> 01:22:32.761
But jealous.

01:22:35.299 --> 01:22:38.035
Anyway, if you miss him more than enough...

01:22:38.424 --> 01:22:40.135
I should depart.

01:22:41.579 --> 01:22:43.513
Goodbye.

01:24:55.982 --> 01:25:01.016
I've come in my overalls,
so you know I'm serious.

01:25:03.668 --> 01:25:05.604
They've been all over the country.

01:25:05.946 --> 01:25:07.123
These overalls.

01:25:07.348 --> 01:25:12.211
In the last year, they've wrap shoulders
with every kind of Spaniard.

01:25:12.299 --> 01:25:16.269
They've had a set,
they've directed plays and films.

01:25:16.591 --> 01:25:17.909
They are exhausted.

01:25:18.015 --> 01:25:24.655
And they are extremly glad to be here,
drinking wine with friends in the sun.

01:25:25.168 --> 01:25:26.481
But...

01:25:26.914 --> 01:25:30.524
We mustn't be deceived
by sunshine in Madrid.

01:25:30.998 --> 01:25:33.641
Whilst fascism is casting its shadow
all over Spain.

01:25:35.162 --> 01:25:38.713
Great sacrifices need to be made.

01:25:39.315 --> 01:25:43.105
Great risks need to be taken.

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:46.525
So, I have something
here to read to you.

01:25:46.526 --> 01:25:49.954
And if you are proof, then I
want to ask for your signatures.

01:25:55.267 --> 01:26:03.363
<i>We, intellect ones, artists and members of the
free thinking professions reaffirm our support...</i>

01:26:03.542 --> 01:26:06.696
<i>... for the democratically
elected popular government...</i>

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:11.291
<i>... and we do so for the aspirations. We...</i>

01:26:14.584 --> 01:26:19.412
<i>We do so... I do so...
for freedom.</i>

01:26:19.883 --> 01:26:21.419
<i>Not some romantic ideal.</i>

01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:25.061
<i>Not something for students to
shout about in late night bars.</i>

01:26:25.544 --> 01:26:26.761
<i>That's easy.</i>

01:26:27.569 --> 01:26:30.031
<i>That's just a word.</i>

01:26:30.445 --> 01:26:36.743
<i>Real freedom is hard.
It's painful.</i>

01:26:37.477 --> 01:26:39.248
<i>It's dangerous.</i>

01:26:40.787 --> 01:26:42.225
<i>But I want it.</i>

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.571
<i>I want to try for it.</i>

01:26:44.798 --> 01:26:49.237
<i>Whoever I decide to be.</i>

01:26:49.418 --> 01:26:51.957
<i>However I decide to live.</i>

01:26:52.849 --> 01:26:56.444
<i>Whomever I choose as my companions.</i>

01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:57.872
<i>My friends.</i>

01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:00.898
<i>It's my right.</i>

01:27:01.812 --> 01:27:04.418
<i>It's our right.</i>

01:27:04.517 --> 01:27:07.738
<i>Freedom.
Now.</i>

01:27:08.517 --> 01:27:10.313
<i>In Spain.</i>

01:27:36.937 --> 01:27:37.999
Thanks.

01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:39.370
Come here.

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.087
I don't see him anymore.

01:27:49.448 --> 01:27:50.036
No?

01:27:50.548 --> 01:27:57.054
Don't care, too. We no longer speak the same
language. The only word he understands now...

01:27:57.211 --> 01:27:58.695
... is "money".

01:27:59.808 --> 01:28:01.251
He wrote to me.

01:28:02.630 --> 01:28:03.825
And?

01:28:04.281 --> 01:28:05.511
I know.

01:28:06.122 --> 01:28:08.278
8 years.
Nothing.

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:12.966
He asked me to come and see him.
Come and meet Gala.

01:28:13.216 --> 01:28:17.666
Bloody witch. Still fucking every artist
in Paris, from what I hear.

01:28:18.706 --> 01:28:19.779
What else?

01:28:19.933 --> 01:28:22.247
He thought we should work together again.

01:28:22.667 --> 01:28:26.233
He said we could reach an agreement
this time, on a lot of things.

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.926
He signed it "Buda".

01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:32.286
Will you see him?

01:28:35.691 --> 01:28:38.846
Be careful, Federico.

01:28:41.423 --> 01:28:44.669
Where are you off to, brother?
The rally is this way.

01:28:45.135 --> 01:28:46.827
Senor García Lorca!
- Hello.

01:28:48.013 --> 01:28:52.784
I didn't recognize you. Join us at the demonstrations
and the support of the republic.

01:28:53.098 --> 01:28:56.848
The troops in Morocco are siding with the fascist.
- I'll come later.

01:28:56.849 --> 01:28:58.187
- Gracias.
- Good luck.

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.050
Come in.

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:26.560
Come through.

01:29:29.601 --> 01:29:34.198
Time and Dalí wait for no man!

01:29:36.865 --> 01:29:40.765
Ignore this absolute prutescent
travesty of a hotel.

01:29:41.089 --> 01:29:43.159
It's temporary surroundings.

01:29:44.818 --> 01:29:48.871
Apart from the bear.
Have you seen the bear?

01:29:51.157 --> 01:29:55.995
It has a reality about it, in this bear...

01:29:56.459 --> 01:29:59.713
... primacy of Eden.

01:30:07.594 --> 01:30:08.997
You look the same.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:10.808
Thanks.

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.544
I grew this moustache.

01:30:20.718 --> 01:30:28.763
What shall it be? This place?
College? Merde? Us?

01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:43.955
Federico.

01:30:54.554 --> 01:30:56.122
All this time.

01:30:58.245 --> 01:31:00.590
All this time.

01:31:02.409 --> 01:31:07.647
The dark, unfavaned retrospect

01:31:08.018 --> 01:31:11.387
...the teaming gulf.

01:31:13.818 --> 01:31:15.585
The sleepers.

01:31:17.078 --> 01:31:19.257
And shadows.

01:31:26.304 --> 01:31:27.404
Cheri.

01:31:28.897 --> 01:31:31.255
It's Federico.

01:31:31.890 --> 01:31:34.607
Federico, this is Gala.
My wife.

01:31:36.351 --> 01:31:39.065
Delighted to meet you, at last.

01:31:39.619 --> 01:31:41.366
Isn't he charming, cheri?

01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:43.813
I've heard so much about you.

01:31:56.601 --> 01:31:57.558
Smile.

01:32:03.676 --> 01:32:05.274
He went to America.

01:32:06.657 --> 01:32:10.239
I loved it. Well, it's America.

01:32:10.657 --> 01:32:14.151
New York was... pitiful.

01:32:14.345 --> 01:32:17.965
Poverty and suffering...
- We're gonna go back to America soon.

01:32:19.714 --> 01:32:21.405
Spain just seems so...

01:32:21.655 --> 01:32:22.253
Dangerous?

01:32:22.551 --> 01:32:23.879
Passe.

01:32:25.991 --> 01:32:29.990
Anyway, America is the place for our opera.

01:32:30.852 --> 01:32:36.913
No. You write, I design.
It will be a triumph.

01:32:37.163 --> 01:32:38.105
Will it?

01:32:38.285 --> 01:32:41.032
Undoubtedly, considering
the subject matter.

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:41.931
Which will be?

01:32:42.732 --> 01:32:45.208
Louis the Second of Bavaria.

01:32:45.395 --> 01:32:49.449
He was... He was a deviant, you know.

01:32:51.216 --> 01:32:57.306
It'll be the most shocking opera ever staged.
All kinds of unspeakable things...

01:32:57.513 --> 01:32:59.981
Louie told me the surrealists
threw you out.

01:33:00.572 --> 01:33:03.611
So, the two of you've become friends again.
When did that happen?

01:33:03.881 --> 01:33:06.746
I imagine around the time
he stopped seeing you.

01:33:06.799 --> 01:33:11.619
The surrealists expelled
me from the movement.

01:33:12.547 --> 01:33:15.594
Terribly traumatic.

01:33:15.704 --> 01:33:18.299
Breton is a genius.

01:33:18.612 --> 01:33:26.798
His whole equation with communism
just makes me want to...

01:33:29.997 --> 01:33:31.110
... puke.

01:33:36.368 --> 01:33:43.678
The only viable solution for surrealism:
the World War.

01:33:44.069 --> 01:33:46.210
A cleansing.

01:33:47.272 --> 01:33:49.086
A great flood.

01:33:49.284 --> 01:33:52.546
Cut through all this dead wood.

01:33:52.770 --> 01:33:54.988
Purge the weak elements.

01:33:55.901 --> 01:33:58.081
An era of enlightenment.

01:33:58.082 --> 01:34:02.803
Are you saying you
actually support the fascist?

01:34:04.363 --> 01:34:09.931
You used to be an anarchist.
- Oh, Federico, you've become so... liberal.

01:34:10.517 --> 01:34:14.772
With all the government schemes
and your theateral little people...

01:34:16.495 --> 01:34:21.568
Listen. This country is on the blink
of something terrible.

01:34:22.162 --> 01:34:25.482
And here you are siding with the people who
could destroy everything we've stand for.

01:34:25.588 --> 01:34:27.804
I know you are not through,

01:34:27.805 --> 01:34:34.205
but you must see that'd be no freedom
of speech, anyone who is different...

01:34:34.832 --> 01:34:36.688
Who strays from the norm...

01:34:36.915 --> 01:34:38.775
... would just be wiped out.

01:34:42.573 --> 01:34:44.258
Would that be a bad thing?

01:34:46.067 --> 01:34:47.693
Naughty boy.

01:34:48.312 --> 01:34:49.263
You're joking.

01:34:50.668 --> 01:34:53.638
Salvador is completely apolitical.

01:34:55.992 --> 01:34:57.208
<i>No one knows you</i>

01:34:57.425 --> 01:35:00.130
<i>No
But I sing of you</i>

01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:02.282
<i>I sing, for later on,</i>

01:35:02.317 --> 01:35:04.371
<i>Of your profile and your grace</i>

01:35:04.977 --> 01:35:07.170
<i>The noble maturity of your understanding</i>

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:11.356
<i>Your appetite for death and
the taste of its mouth</i>

01:35:12.217 --> 01:35:14.669
<i>The sadness in you valiant gaiety.</i>

01:35:17.988 --> 01:35:19.773
It's nothing to my ode.

01:35:20.972 --> 01:35:22.712
Gala, you've heard my ode.

01:35:22.907 --> 01:35:26.444
Press went crazy for it.

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:30.527
<i>Oh, Salvador Dali,
with your olive-colored voice</i>

01:35:31.753 --> 01:35:34.085
Federico, you finish the rest.
I want Gala to hear it.

01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:40.214
I'm afraid I have to go.

01:35:44.718 --> 01:35:46.692
It's been such a pleasure.

01:35:58.245 --> 01:36:00.458
- Let me see you out.
- There is no need.

01:36:01.116 --> 01:36:02.871
She doesn't mind, you know?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.107
She and I are like twins, not like lovers.

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:07.470
Not like us.

01:36:09.766 --> 01:36:14.550
Look at you, you little beast.
You're so angry, you could spit.

01:36:14.957 --> 01:36:18.641
I knew you would be.
I planned everything.

01:36:19.964 --> 01:36:23.900
And, is everything going
according to plan, Salvador?

01:36:24.264 --> 01:36:26.076
Knew you would say that, too.

01:36:27.803 --> 01:36:32.757
Listen, it's alright now.
Everything is alright.

01:36:33.103 --> 01:36:34.903
Go pack your things

01:36:35.036 --> 01:36:36.812
Say your goodbyes

01:36:37.304 --> 01:36:39.741
And we'll conquer America together.

01:36:42.603 --> 01:36:46.177
I hurt your pride, I know.

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:48.299
But, I'll make it up to you.

01:36:48.982 --> 01:36:51.171
You'll teach me how.

01:36:57.926 --> 01:36:59.352
There's someone else?

01:37:00.367 --> 01:37:06.351
It doesn't matter. There's Gala...
We can all live together. We can...

01:37:07.591 --> 01:37:09.763
Goodbye, Salvador.

01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:18.049
You'll come back.

01:37:19.384 --> 01:37:23.063
Sweet little tail dangeling
between your legs.

01:37:23.886 --> 01:37:26.456
You won't be able to think
about anything else!

01:37:27.718 --> 01:37:30.492
Senor García Lorca, how was your meeting
with Dalí?

01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:32.590
Will you work together again?

01:37:32.711 --> 01:37:34.108
What do you think of him?

01:37:34.975 --> 01:37:36.626
What do I think of him?

01:37:36.756 --> 01:37:39.838
Well... He's a genius.

01:37:40.655 --> 01:37:41.648
A genius.

01:37:41.761 --> 01:37:44.400
Genius, Salvador Dalí!

01:37:49.049 --> 01:37:53.531
Very charming... Exactly as you've said.

01:37:58.890 --> 01:38:04.658
I'm going to my room, Salvador.
I'll see you in the morning.

01:38:44.846 --> 01:38:46.563
See you in the morning, my love.

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:34.268
I just saw Paco.
What on Earth do you think you're doing?

01:39:34.455 --> 01:39:35.713
I'm going back to Granada.

01:39:36.323 --> 01:39:39.717
Have you finally lost your mind?
The news this morning, Federico?

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:44.104
Morocco's fallen. It's only a matter of time
before they get to Granada.

01:39:44.559 --> 01:39:45.938
Listen...

01:39:46.817 --> 01:39:49.289
I'll only be there for a few days.

01:39:49.736 --> 01:39:51.273
I have to be with my family.

01:39:51.427 --> 01:39:54.855
I've got so much do to, Louie.
I can tell you...

01:39:55.348 --> 01:40:00.802
I feel like.. like.. I could write
6 plays without stopping.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:04.407
Without eating.
- Then write them here.

01:40:04.974 --> 01:40:08.628
Think about it, Frederico.
These people know who you are,

01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:12.722
what you've been saying about Franco...
They know everything.

01:40:12.981 --> 01:40:14.965
I have to go home, Louie.

01:40:15.113 --> 01:40:18.967
I'll call you as soon as I can.
- Be careful.

01:41:29.446 --> 01:41:30.823
Open the door!

01:41:31.975 --> 01:41:35.580
- What are you doing?
- Federico García Lorca?

01:41:35.954 --> 01:41:38.481
I'm arresting you in the name
of the New Granada.

01:41:38.557 --> 01:41:40.242
What are you talking about?

01:41:40.243 --> 01:41:41.428
- No!
- Come on!

01:41:41.647 --> 01:41:44.325
García Lorca, it is you, marricon.

01:41:46.131 --> 01:41:48.905
Granada.
Spain.

01:43:39.202 --> 01:43:42.848
The incredible rumours are preceding from
the core of the front this evening.

01:43:43.094 --> 01:43:47.664
Reporting the abduction of the
poet, Federico García Lorca,

01:43:47.665 --> 01:43:51.244
from his home town in
Granada, three days ago.

01:43:53.818 --> 01:43:59.621
The governor of Granada says he does
not know the whereabouts of García Lorca.

01:44:58.556 --> 01:45:00.043
Still alive.

01:45:00.909 --> 01:45:04.053
Only one way to kill a queer.

01:45:22.664 --> 01:45:25.718
The weil of mystery
overshadowing the disappearance

01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:28.243
of Federico García
Lorca has been removed.

01:45:28.406 --> 01:45:32.731
The news is coming this evening
that the execution of the poet,

01:45:32.732 --> 01:45:35.705
Federico García Lorca,
has been confirmed.

01:46:17.715 --> 01:46:18.885
Federico.

01:46:56.468 --> 01:46:57.740
Salvador!

01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:01.892
The guests are here.
