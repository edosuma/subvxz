00:02.000 --> 00:04.930
Kurt Woodley.

00:04.930 --> 00:09.240
His priors read like a bio
from the Marquis de Sade.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.900
Felony assault,

00:10.910 --> 00:12.810
assault with a deadly weapon,

00:12.810 --> 00:14.540
aggravated mayhem.

00:16.239 --> 00:19.980
The victim was a teenage girl.

00:19.980 --> 00:22.550
Rape, murder two.

00:24.250 --> 00:28.250
My partner and I busted him
for the Rosewood shootings.

00:28.260 --> 00:31.790
Husband and wife,
asleep in their beds,

00:31.790 --> 00:35.130
two slugs each at close range.

00:35.130 --> 00:40.400
It was a clean collar.
We had cause.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.870
Judge didn't agree.

00:42.870 --> 00:46.240
She said the search
was illegal.

00:47.740 --> 00:50.240
Woodley walked
out of the courtroom

00:50.250 --> 00:55.020
and smiled at us
as he passed.

00:55.020 --> 00:57.520
( distorted voice ):
<i> You've all had a chance</i>
<i> to review the file.</i>

00:57.520 --> 01:00.150
<i> It's time to vote</i>
<i> on Mr. Woodley's fate:</i>

01:00.160 --> 01:02.390
<i> live or die?</i>

01:02.390 --> 01:03.590
Die.

01:03.590 --> 01:04.590
Yeah. Die.

01:04.590 --> 01:05.590
Die.

01:05.590 --> 01:06.790
Die.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.300
Die.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.500
Die.

01:14.770 --> 01:15.900
Live.

01:17.740 --> 01:19.110
Die.

01:19.110 --> 01:21.980
<i> Die. Majority rules.</i>

01:21.980 --> 01:24.380
<i> The sentence will</i>
<i> be carried out.</i>

01:24.380 --> 01:27.080
I'll see ya, slimebag.

01:31.020 --> 01:33.890
( techno music playing,
indistinct conversations )

01:33.890 --> 01:35.020
MAN:
Come on, baby, shake it!

01:35.020 --> 01:36.490
Yee-haw! Yeah!

01:41.430 --> 01:42.960
MAN 2:
Do it, baby, do it!

01:42.960 --> 01:46.970
( shouting and cheering )

01:55.040 --> 01:56.040
Thank you.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.040
Show me you mean it,
darling.

01:58.050 --> 01:59.250
Hey, let go! Bruno!

01:59.250 --> 02:01.680
Hey, hey! No hands
on the girls.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.180
What do I get in this dive
for my 20 bucks?

02:04.190 --> 02:06.490
You get to look.

02:06.490 --> 02:08.289
MAN:
Hell of a joint, huh?

02:08.289 --> 02:10.759
All glands, no hands.

02:10.759 --> 02:11.760
( laughs )

02:13.530 --> 02:14.530
Hey.

02:14.530 --> 02:16.200
I'll take a refund.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.960
Hey, spare a light?

02:49.360 --> 02:51.360
Thanks.

02:51.370 --> 02:54.270
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

02:55.670 --> 02:57.370
Hey, what the hell are you--?

03:01.380 --> 03:03.780
You shouldn't smoke.

03:03.780 --> 03:06.150
It's bad for your health.

03:17.930 --> 03:21.400
(<i> light rock action</i>
<i> theme playing</i> )

04:07.480 --> 04:09.340
WOMAN ( over radio ):
<i> This is Central.</i>

04:09.340 --> 04:11.440
<i> What is the status</i>
<i> of the location, Ranger?</i>

04:11.450 --> 04:13.210
P.D.'s got the crime scene
under control.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.610
and Forensics
will forward a report

04:14.620 --> 04:15.780
as soon as they got
something.

04:15.780 --> 04:18.490
<i> Copy that.</i>
Ten-four.

04:23.090 --> 04:25.490
Kurt Woodley cut down
in his prime.

04:25.490 --> 04:26.990
You were right, man,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
he's got a rap sheet
as long as your arm.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.500
Hell, it fits the pattern:

04:30.500 --> 04:34.940
silenced .38, close range,
no witnesses

04:34.940 --> 04:36.940
and very professional.

04:36.940 --> 04:39.170
That's ten
in the last six months.

04:39.170 --> 04:42.180
Yeah. Four in Tarrant County
and six in Dallas.

04:42.180 --> 04:44.540
Why don't you check
Waco and Houston.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.010
Let's see how far
this thing spreads.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.510
All right.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.180
You got something on your mind?

04:49.180 --> 04:52.120
Yeah, he's killing guys who are
less than model citizens.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.160
I think we have a vigilante
on our hands.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.690
We have no way of knowing
who his next victim's gonna be.

04:58.690 --> 05:01.760
I think he knows exactly who
his next victim's going to be.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.600
This guy's on
a mission, Trivette,

05:03.600 --> 05:05.800
and we gotta stop him.

05:12.310 --> 05:14.440
( rock music playing in bar )

05:16.710 --> 05:19.610
Hey, big dog,
cookies and cream.

05:19.610 --> 05:22.020
This isn't an intensive care,

05:22.020 --> 05:24.680
and your foot's not
set up in concrete.

05:24.690 --> 05:27.650
Come on back around here
and help yourself. I'm busy.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.690
I'll have a coffee.
Make it a double.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.230
Sure, customer.

05:35.230 --> 05:37.000
Comin' right up.

05:38.570 --> 05:40.430
So, what's going on, Cordell?

05:40.440 --> 05:44.170
Well, looks like we have
a vigilante on our hands, C.D.

05:44.170 --> 05:47.140
Our last victim was a guy named
Kurt Woodley. Remember him?

05:47.140 --> 05:48.880
Oh, yeah. I remember Woodley.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.340
I busted him
a couple of times there,

05:50.350 --> 05:52.550
when he was trying
to earn his bones.

05:52.550 --> 05:55.380
He bought a one-way ticket
to Clay County a long time ago.

05:55.380 --> 05:56.380
Hi, guys.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.350
Hey, Alex.
Coffee?

05:58.350 --> 05:59.650
No time. Thanks.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.690
I just came by to remind you
about dinner tonight.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.490
At my place.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.900
What are you talking about?

06:08.900 --> 06:12.230
Cordell, don't you
do this to me.

06:12.230 --> 06:13.900
You said you were coming.

06:13.900 --> 06:14.930
Now, I'm expecting you.

06:14.940 --> 06:16.800
Dinner, you and me, tonight?

06:16.810 --> 06:19.810
Yes. That's kind of
what I had in mind.

06:19.810 --> 06:22.840
Candlelight,
rack of lamb.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.080
You remember how this works.

06:25.080 --> 06:28.150
Eight o'clock.
Don't be late.

06:28.150 --> 06:29.580
See you, guys.

06:29.580 --> 06:30.980
Wait a minute, Alex.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.450
ALEX:
Eight o'clock.

06:38.730 --> 06:40.290
What?

06:40.300 --> 06:43.330
You didn't tell me that Alex
invited you over for dinner.

06:43.330 --> 06:45.100
That's because I didn't know
anything about it

06:45.100 --> 06:47.030
until two minutes ago.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.870
Oh, come on, Cordell.
This is family down here.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.540
You don't have
to be embarrassed.

06:50.540 --> 06:53.310
C.D., I'm telling you, I don't
know anything about dinner.

06:53.310 --> 06:56.180
Yeah. So, what are you
going to wear?

06:56.180 --> 06:57.940
What do you mean--?

06:57.950 --> 06:59.580
What do you mean,
what am I going to wear?

06:59.580 --> 07:01.810
I mean that Alex invited you
over for a home-cooked meal.

07:01.820 --> 07:04.520
You're not gonna go looking like
something the cows drug in.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.850
Then maybe I should wear
a tuxedo.

07:05.850 --> 07:10.290
No. It's too formal.
Yes, you wanna wear a tie.

07:10.290 --> 07:12.060
You wanna wear a suit.
But you don't wanna look

07:12.060 --> 07:13.060
like you planned it.

07:13.060 --> 07:14.730
C.D.:
Flowers.

07:14.730 --> 07:17.300
A hell of a lot of flowers.
Fifteen dollars'll go a long way

07:17.300 --> 07:18.300
in that department.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.370
C.D., I am telling you,

07:19.370 --> 07:21.400
I was not invited
to dinner tonight.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.970
Cordell, you may know
that penal code

07:23.970 --> 07:25.440
from cover to cover,

07:25.440 --> 07:27.470
but you don't know split peas
from coffee about women.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.340
Well, I'm not gonna
argue with you about it.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.850
It's just her style.

07:31.850 --> 07:33.880
Doesn't make any difference
if she invited you

07:33.880 --> 07:35.580
two weeks ago
or two minutes ago.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.750
It all has the same result.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.250
Oh, jeez.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.090
Stay out of those
damn peanuts, will ya?

07:41.090 --> 07:42.120
She's gonna be slaving over

07:42.120 --> 07:43.790
an oven for you.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.460
At least you can go over
halfway hungry.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.160
MAN:
It is tasty!

07:47.160 --> 07:49.500
WOMAN:
Mmm. Oh, it's good.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.960
I'm hungry now.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.170
You ain't gonna
eat no peanuts.

07:53.170 --> 07:54.630
You ain't gonna get
any of my cookies.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.720
Wow.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.380
Am I dressed too, uh...?

08:10.390 --> 08:11.380
No.

08:11.390 --> 08:13.590
You look wonderful.

08:16.190 --> 08:18.590
You smell good too.

08:22.060 --> 08:25.200
Grant Wallace,
this is Cordell Walker.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.800
Nice to meet you, Ranger.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.300
Oh...

08:29.640 --> 08:31.270
Pleasure.

08:31.270 --> 08:33.110
I've heard a lot about you.

08:33.110 --> 08:34.880
Are those for me?

08:34.880 --> 08:38.080
Oh, yeah. Um...

08:38.080 --> 08:39.950
C.D. Wanted you to have these.

08:39.950 --> 08:43.620
I'll have to thank C.D.
next time I see him.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.320
They're beautiful.

08:49.690 --> 08:51.860
So, um...

08:54.230 --> 08:55.460
You staying for dinner?

08:55.460 --> 08:58.000
Dinner? Um,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.230
I'm not sure I understand.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.270
Um, I can explain.

09:04.270 --> 09:05.740
Why don't we all sit down.

09:05.740 --> 09:07.140
Sure.

09:08.740 --> 09:10.940
Trivette, I'm gonna
kill you.

09:10.950 --> 09:11.950
What?

09:11.950 --> 09:13.450
Oh, nothing.

09:18.450 --> 09:20.450
Grant works for
the Justice Department,

09:20.460 --> 09:22.460
and he wanted to meet you

09:22.460 --> 09:24.560
without anybody else
knowing about it.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.330
Um, we went to
law school together.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.860
And he knew that I knew you,

09:28.860 --> 09:30.860
and so he asked me
to set it up.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.970
It had to be done quickly.

09:33.970 --> 09:36.000
So we're not
going to have dinner.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.610
I'm sorry if I threw you
a curve.

09:39.610 --> 09:42.110
But, um, if you're hungry,
I think I have

09:42.110 --> 09:43.740
a half a turkey sandwich
in the fridge.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.910
Oh, no, no, that's okay,
I had a big lunch today.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.380
Thanks, though.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.820
Great. Can we get down
to business?

09:49.820 --> 09:51.020
What business?

09:51.020 --> 09:52.390
Well, Ranger,

09:52.390 --> 09:54.220
you're aware that there've
been a large number

09:54.220 --> 09:56.890
of these vigilante-style
assassinations around here

09:56.890 --> 09:57.890
in the last six months.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.490
I'm aware of it. Why?

09:59.490 --> 10:00.760
Well, we're beginning to suspect

10:00.760 --> 10:02.360
it's the work
of an organized group.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.930
You have any leads?

10:03.930 --> 10:06.200
Not enough.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.070
What we need is somebody
to get into this group.

10:08.070 --> 10:12.670
We need somebody to infiltrate
the organization.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.510
Now I know why I've been
invited here tonight.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.380
I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.550
You will?

10:20.550 --> 10:23.250
(<i> charming, light theme</i>
<i> playing</i> )

10:23.250 --> 10:25.050
Only kidding.

10:32.130 --> 10:35.360
You know how I hate it
when you don't tell me stuff.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.660
You better tell me.
You better tell me. Wha--?

10:37.670 --> 10:38.970
What, you want me to beg?

10:38.970 --> 10:41.300
Yeah.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.240
Boy, she must've fed you
real good, though.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.540
If you only knew, Trivette.

10:44.540 --> 10:47.540
Well, come on.
Tell me what she cooked.

10:47.540 --> 10:50.510
No. No. No.
Tell me what she wore.

10:50.510 --> 10:52.110
You're really
chomping at the bit, huh?

10:52.110 --> 10:53.810
Sue me. I like details.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.820
WOMAN ( over radio ):
<i> Walker, we just got a hit</i>

<i> Suspect vehicle is headed west</i>
<i> on Magnolia near Broadmore.</i>

<i> You sittin' down?</i>

11:02.560 --> 11:05.160
<i> The car's registered</i>
<i> to Reed Jameson.</i>

11:05.160 --> 11:06.930
We got it.

11:06.930 --> 11:08.460
Do I know Reed Jameson?

11:08.460 --> 11:09.530
Yeah, he was the wheel man

11:09.530 --> 11:11.060
for that bank heist
a while back.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.970
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.810
I've never seen you
carry a backup.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.570
You never know, Trivette.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.880

( screaming and shouting )

11:52.470 --> 11:54.970
Ah!
Whoa!

11:54.980 --> 11:56.840
( yells )

12:02.880 --> 12:03.880
Where'd he go?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.380
Upstairs, upstairs!

12:05.390 --> 12:06.620
Look out.

Hey, watch out!

12:31.810 --> 12:32.810
WALKER:
Hold it!

12:32.810 --> 12:34.010
Okay! Okay!

12:34.020 --> 12:36.080
I give, man.

12:43.490 --> 12:44.820
Pick it up.

12:44.830 --> 12:48.260
Man, what are you doing?
You crazy!

12:49.900 --> 12:51.770
( screaming )

12:51.770 --> 12:53.130
I said, pick it up.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.670
No way.

12:54.670 --> 12:56.340
I got your back!

12:56.340 --> 12:59.240
Stay back.
Put it away, Trivette.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.840
He's mine.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.740
Put it away!

13:07.020 --> 13:08.650
Now, for the last time,

13:08.650 --> 13:10.420
pick it up.

13:10.420 --> 13:12.750
I said, no way!

13:12.750 --> 13:14.690
Suit yourself.

13:16.090 --> 13:17.590
( yells )

13:29.800 --> 13:33.810
(<i> moving theme playing</i> )

13:54.760 --> 13:58.600
( indistinct conversations )

13:58.600 --> 14:00.400
MAN:
How's he doin'?

14:00.400 --> 14:02.300
WOMAN:
His doctor changed
that medication.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.280
Will you relax?
Sit down.

14:12.610 --> 14:15.250
I don't wanna sit down.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.780
Suit yourself.

14:25.960 --> 14:29.060
Now, what the hell
happened back there?

14:29.060 --> 14:30.300
What do you think happened?

14:30.300 --> 14:33.300
I saw you shoot a man
in cold blood.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.930
He had a gun.

14:34.940 --> 14:37.670
I saw you toss him
your gun, Walker.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.310
Trivette, this has nothing
to do with you.

14:39.310 --> 14:40.470
The hell it doesn't.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.880
All I know is what I saw.

14:41.880 --> 14:42.980
I can't just let it slide.

14:42.980 --> 14:44.710
There's gonna be
a shooting review.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.210
What the hell
you want me to tell 'em?

14:48.550 --> 14:49.750
Come here.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.420
Get in here.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.990
Now, I thought I knew you
pretty well, man.

14:59.990 --> 15:01.390
Hey, I look up to you.
You--

15:01.400 --> 15:02.900
You know what I tell people?

15:02.900 --> 15:05.000
I say, "Cordell Walker,
he's the finest Ranger we got.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.500
He's the guy that goes
to the wall for the law."

15:07.500 --> 15:10.000
You cut the guy down.
I saw you.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.140
Now, I'm asking you.
How the hell could you do that?

15:13.140 --> 15:14.570
Like this.

15:18.310 --> 15:20.250
Everybody okay in here?

15:20.250 --> 15:22.950
Yeah, everything's okay,

15:22.950 --> 15:26.320
but I think Trivette thought
he was going to meet his maker.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.190
Trivette, meet agent Adcock.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.860
Looks like you two put on
a pretty convincing performance.

15:31.860 --> 15:33.530
This was all a setup.

15:33.530 --> 15:36.460
Yeah, I'm sorry, but it was
something I had to do.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.260
And you were in on it?

15:38.270 --> 15:40.570
Only 'cause I had to.

15:40.570 --> 15:42.900
And I don't like being shot at,
even if it is blanks.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.270
ADCOCK:
Cooperating got you
a reduced sentence, didn't it?

15:45.270 --> 15:47.770
Well, I got to get
this piece of work

15:47.780 --> 15:50.180
to an out-of-county
lockup under an alias.

15:50.180 --> 15:51.280
Thanks, Walker.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.510
You bet.

15:52.510 --> 15:53.510
Come on.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.420
I'm just checking.

15:59.420 --> 16:02.520
( both chuckle )

16:02.520 --> 16:03.520
Scared you, huh.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.730
Yeah. Boy,
so I'm not dead, huh.

16:05.730 --> 16:06.730
No.

16:06.730 --> 16:07.890
Oh, man. Whoa.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.560
Least I don't have
to testify against you.

16:09.560 --> 16:12.070
Well, don't count on that.

16:12.070 --> 16:15.570
Besides, how could you ever
believe that I would shoot

16:15.570 --> 16:16.600
a man in cold blood?

16:16.600 --> 16:20.110
Oh, I knew all along
this was a setup.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.140
Get outta here.

16:21.140 --> 16:22.310
Sure. Sure.

16:22.310 --> 16:23.940
I did.

16:25.710 --> 16:27.480
TRIVETTE:
At that point,
the suspect exited

16:27.480 --> 16:29.750
the rear of the building.

16:29.750 --> 16:32.120
Ranger Walker instructed me
specifically

16:32.120 --> 16:33.450
to hold my position,

16:33.460 --> 16:35.890
and he went out the back
to cover the alley.

16:35.890 --> 16:39.360
And did you hold your position,
Ranger Trivette?

16:39.360 --> 16:41.890
Yes, ma'am, I did
until I heard the gunshot,

16:41.900 --> 16:43.800
and then I went out back
to the alley, also.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.660
And what happened?

16:45.670 --> 16:49.570
I saw Ranger Walker,
and I saw the suspect

16:49.570 --> 16:51.970
with his hands
in the air.

16:51.970 --> 16:55.710
Ranger Walker had
his revolver drawn.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.010
Was the suspect
armed at this time?

17:05.750 --> 17:08.990
Was the suspect armed
at this time?

17:08.990 --> 17:10.490
No, ma'am, he wasn't.

17:10.490 --> 17:13.290
But there was
a weapon on the ground.

17:13.290 --> 17:16.300
So when Ranger Walker
fired his revolver,

17:16.300 --> 17:18.230
the suspect was not armed?

17:18.230 --> 17:20.970
No, sir, he was not.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.270
Do you have anything
to add to this,

17:26.270 --> 17:27.740
Ranger Walker?

17:27.740 --> 17:29.080
The only thing I have to add

17:29.080 --> 17:31.040
is the world's a lot
better off without him.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.580
Yeah, we've been going over
your record, Walker.

17:34.580 --> 17:39.090
It's hardly a testimonial
for good police work.

17:39.090 --> 17:41.090
Three warnings
in two months.

17:41.090 --> 17:43.090
Excessive force.

17:43.090 --> 17:45.560
One month suspension for beating
a confession out of a suspect.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.760
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

17:46.760 --> 17:48.790
The confession was thrown out
at the trial.

17:48.800 --> 17:49.800
March 9, 1993,

17:49.800 --> 17:53.000
brought up before
the disciplinary board

17:53.000 --> 17:56.070
for conduct
unbecoming a Ranger

17:56.070 --> 17:57.340
June 25, 1993, demerits issued

17:57.340 --> 17:59.970
for insubordination
towards a senior officer.

17:59.970 --> 18:01.140
December 8, 1993,

18:01.140 --> 18:04.140
almost suspended
but officially reprimanded

18:04.150 --> 18:07.950
for overly aggressive behavior
toward suspected perpetrators.

18:07.950 --> 18:11.250
The board ordered two months'
psychiatric evaluation.

18:11.250 --> 18:12.920
I have to be honest with you,
Ranger Walker.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.620
I've heard good things
about you,

18:14.620 --> 18:18.220
but all this comes
as somewhat of a shock.

18:21.260 --> 18:23.260
You got nothing to say?

18:24.570 --> 18:27.070
Well, the only thing
I've got to say is,

18:27.070 --> 18:29.670
how come everyone
has water here but me?

18:29.670 --> 18:32.170
Well, in that case,
my recommendation

18:32.170 --> 18:34.370
is, uh, that you be suspended

18:34.380 --> 18:36.310
and that this case
be taken to the grand jury

18:36.310 --> 18:37.480
for an indictment.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.510
And at that time,
you'll be removed

18:39.510 --> 18:40.650
from the Texas Rangers,

18:40.650 --> 18:42.850
permanently.

18:47.050 --> 18:48.960
( distorted voice ):
<i> I would say that our search</i>

18:48.960 --> 18:51.560
<i> for someone from</i>
<i> the Ranger service</i>

18:51.560 --> 18:53.490
<i> to join our committee is over.</i>

18:53.490 --> 18:56.960
<i> Ranger Walker would be a fine</i>
<i> asset to our organization.</i>

18:56.970 --> 19:00.430
<i> It's time for a vote:</i>
<i> yes or no.</i>

19:01.440 --> 19:03.700
Yes.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.570
Yes.

19:05.570 --> 19:07.170
Yes.

19:07.170 --> 19:08.340
Yes.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.340
Yes.

19:10.340 --> 19:12.840
Yes.

19:12.850 --> 19:15.080
Yes.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.520
Yes.

19:16.520 --> 19:20.520
( country music playing,
indistinct conversations )

19:28.530 --> 19:30.260
You missed.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.830
Wouldn't be the first time.

19:32.830 --> 19:35.540
You're Ranger Walker,
aren't you?

19:37.240 --> 19:40.070
<i> Was</i> Ranger Walker.

19:40.070 --> 19:42.070
And you're blocking my shot.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.450
Could I buy you a drink?

19:48.450 --> 19:50.080
No, thanks.

19:52.450 --> 19:55.090
You know, there are
a lot of people

19:55.090 --> 19:56.790
who are on your side.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.490
And what side is that?

19:58.490 --> 19:59.990
The right side.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.330
And if you're interested
in getting to know

20:02.330 --> 20:05.460
some of those people who share
your point of view,

20:05.470 --> 20:07.770
we're having a meeting
tonight, 8:00.

20:07.770 --> 20:09.600
Here are the details.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.510
That's a pretty lady.

20:20.510 --> 20:23.050
What you got, a nibble?

20:23.050 --> 20:27.520
C.D., looks like we got
the whole doggone fish.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.550
Good.

20:45.940 --> 20:49.940
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

21:20.170 --> 21:21.910
( hums )

21:21.910 --> 21:24.880
( distorted voice ):
<i> We're glad you could</i>
<i> make it, Ranger Walker.</i>

21:24.880 --> 21:27.810
<i> Now, if you would,</i>
<i> please sit down.</i>

21:27.820 --> 21:30.920
<i> We still have some questions</i>
<i> we need to ask.</i>

21:39.260 --> 21:41.090
<i> You do understand, Ranger,</i>

21:41.100 --> 21:44.160
<i> that if you decide</i>
<i> to join us,</i>

21:44.160 --> 21:47.230
<i> once you know who the other</i>
<i> members of the committee are,</i>

21:47.230 --> 21:48.670
<i> there's no turning back.</i>

21:48.670 --> 21:50.740
I didn't come here to turn back.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.340
I'm glad you could make it.

21:59.010 --> 22:00.250
Good to meet you, Walker.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.450
I'm sure you know
Judge Riley.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.580
Yeah, I do.
Officer Strangis.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.450
Nice to meet you, Walker.
Welcome aboard.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.450
Thanks.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.260
Emory Harris,
detective, homicide.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.520
Walker, it's good
to have you with us.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.490
Harris.

22:13.490 --> 22:15.490
Lisa Dutton, public defender.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.430
Public defender?

22:17.430 --> 22:20.300
Aren't you on the wrong side
of the fence here, counselor?

22:20.300 --> 22:25.300
I try to protect and defend
innocent people, Walker,

22:25.310 --> 22:27.210
but all too often I'm forced
to put the wrong ones

22:27.210 --> 22:28.370
back out on the street.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.880
I'm just trying to
balance the scales.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.540
Mm.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.150
Where's the guy
I was talking to?

22:33.150 --> 22:34.910
Oh, the chairman never comes
to the meetings.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.420
You were talking to him
by telephone.

22:36.420 --> 22:39.050
The shy type, huh?
Do I get a chance to meet him?

22:39.050 --> 22:40.950
You've met all the people
you need to.

22:40.960 --> 22:41.990
We meet every Tuesday.

22:41.990 --> 22:44.420
The next meeting
is five days from now.

22:44.430 --> 22:45.990
Just tell me when and where.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.090
Well, Lisa's
your contact,

22:47.100 --> 22:49.060
but we still have
a few preliminaries

22:49.060 --> 22:51.900
to take care of before
you're invited to a meeting.
We'll let you know.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.870
What sort of preliminaries?

22:53.870 --> 22:56.740
You'll just have to wait
till we contact you.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.270
Rules of the game.

22:58.270 --> 23:00.540
Whatever you say.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.880
( gobbling )

23:05.880 --> 23:07.110
( mooing )

23:07.110 --> 23:11.120
(<i> tranquil theme playing</i> )

23:21.260 --> 23:23.260
( horse whinnies in distance )

23:52.030 --> 23:54.790
Are we having problems
with the electricity?

23:54.800 --> 23:57.600
Not since the storm
month before last.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.670
How 'bout the telephone?

23:59.670 --> 24:02.300
The only big problem we've had
is you pacing around in here

24:02.300 --> 24:04.100
like a caged animal
for the last couple days.

24:04.100 --> 24:06.770
I thought you liked
having me around.

24:06.770 --> 24:09.710
Well, you know, as the spirits
say, too much of a good thing

24:09.710 --> 24:10.880
isn't always such a good thing.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.250
And which spirit is that?

24:14.250 --> 24:15.780
"Dear Abby."

24:17.120 --> 24:21.320
Oh. Alex, uh, dropped
by and left this for you.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.650
It's your file.

24:22.660 --> 24:26.060
Much better than the false
record that they replaced.

24:26.060 --> 24:27.560
I read it already.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.330
It says "confidential,"
Uncle Ray.

24:30.330 --> 24:32.400
Oh?
( phone ringing )

24:32.400 --> 24:33.400
I'll get it.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.400
All right.

24:46.150 --> 24:47.250
Hello.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.780
Walker, it's me.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.250
What do you want?

24:50.250 --> 24:53.250
Well, I wanted to find out
how you were making out,

24:53.250 --> 24:55.050
and if you had had
a chance yet to look at--

24:55.060 --> 24:56.990
Will you get off my back, Alex?

24:56.990 --> 24:58.460
What?

24:58.460 --> 24:59.890
Where were you?

24:59.890 --> 25:01.890
I didn't see you sticking up
for me at the hearing.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.230
Walker, I don't understand.

25:04.230 --> 25:07.470
The system, Alex.
It doesn't work.

25:07.470 --> 25:09.100
You should be
as disgusted as I am.

25:09.100 --> 25:10.540
ALEX:
<i> Well, I am disgusted,</i>

25:10.540 --> 25:13.340
<i> but it's the law,</i>
<i> and we have to abide by it.</i>

25:13.340 --> 25:15.410
WALKER:
<i> Well, not me.</i>
<i> Not anymore.</i>

25:15.410 --> 25:16.880
ALEX:
<i> I'm sorry you feel that way.</i>

25:16.880 --> 25:18.240
Sure.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.280
( hangs up )

25:20.880 --> 25:22.210
Boom.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.520
Did he have anything new?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.230
I'm not sure.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.960
I think I just got act two
of <i> Nobody Loves me Anymore.</i>

25:37.200 --> 25:38.400
They might be on to his phones.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.270
He's probably
just being careful.

25:40.270 --> 25:42.870
That sounds like Walker.

25:42.870 --> 25:44.770
Don't worry.

25:44.770 --> 25:46.410
Trivette will make contact.

25:46.410 --> 25:47.770
Have you heard from him yet?

25:47.780 --> 25:51.780
Yes. As a matter of fact,
he should be coming in soon.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.680
( chattering )

26:03.460 --> 26:07.390
Hey, partner, let me have
a double meat cheeseburger,

26:07.400 --> 26:08.660
an order of fries--

26:08.660 --> 26:09.760
The seat's taken.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.060
I know it is.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.230
How's it going?

26:13.230 --> 26:14.730
Fine until you came in.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.370
I said, the seat's taken.

26:19.910 --> 26:21.840
Well, as far as I could see,
partner, it was empty.

26:23.310 --> 26:24.940
Then maybe you need glasses.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.780
Hey, hey, hey.
You guys take it out of here.

26:26.780 --> 26:29.050
I just got this place
cleaned up before you came in.

26:29.050 --> 26:30.280
Outside.

26:37.630 --> 26:40.060
Man, that was--
That was, like, real in there.

26:41.460 --> 26:42.630
Don't you think--?

26:42.630 --> 26:44.900
Easy, big fella.
We're just acting, right?

26:44.900 --> 26:46.230
We gotta make it look good.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.600
Great. Method actors.

26:50.140 --> 26:52.170
Okay. I'm almost in.

26:52.170 --> 26:53.570
The names are under the counter.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.210
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

27:00.620 --> 27:01.980
You're almost in?

27:04.420 --> 27:05.550
( groans )

27:05.550 --> 27:06.750
You're getting good at that.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.150
Yeah, well,
I had a good teacher, thanks.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.790
Okay, walk away.

27:15.060 --> 27:16.560
I need more time.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.700
I don't know who the big boss
is yet.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.570
He uses a speakerphone
in the meetings.

27:21.370 --> 27:22.500
So you want a tap?

27:22.500 --> 27:23.840
Yeah.
Have Alex get one.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.270
All right.
Okay.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.550
I'm glad he's in a good mood.

27:40.220 --> 27:42.090
Je-ee-eez.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.730
You know what?
I'm just gonna eat his.

27:56.740 --> 27:58.270
He's not gonna be able
to make it back.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.610
He did pay for this, didn't he?

28:03.610 --> 28:04.840
Nope.

28:18.660 --> 28:20.020
( bell tolls )
LAWYER: Your Honor,

28:20.030 --> 28:21.660
these two men robbed
a convenience store,

28:21.660 --> 28:24.900
lined the customers up along
the floor and executed them

28:24.900 --> 28:26.670
one by one in cold blood.

28:27.570 --> 28:28.800
We've connected them to the gun.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.770
Ballistics says the gun we found
on the defendants

28:30.770 --> 28:32.300
is the murder weapon.

28:32.310 --> 28:35.110
We just can't let these animals
back out onto the street.

28:35.110 --> 28:36.280
LISA:
Objection, Your Honor.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.310
These "animals,"

28:37.310 --> 28:38.780
as the prosecutor
likes to call them,

28:38.780 --> 28:41.210
are still human beings
and, under our constitution,

28:41.220 --> 28:43.180
are entitled to
the same rights as we have.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.290
Officers Paulsen and Wright
had no warrant.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.390
They had no probable cause,

28:48.390 --> 28:49.450
and the gun was obtained

28:49.460 --> 28:50.790
by an illegal
search and seizure.

28:50.790 --> 28:52.120
( scoffs )

28:52.130 --> 28:55.390
The prosecutor's opinion
of my clients' demeanor

28:55.400 --> 28:56.930
is not what is at question here.

28:56.930 --> 28:58.600
Do you have
anything else to add?

29:00.200 --> 29:01.300
No, Your Honor.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.600
All right.
We'll break for lunch.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.240
I'll review the motions
before the court

29:05.240 --> 29:07.470
and give you a decision
when we come back.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.910
We'll reconvene at 2.

29:08.910 --> 29:10.310
( gavel bangs )

29:12.710 --> 29:14.150
( chattering )

29:21.220 --> 29:22.620
Hi.

29:25.290 --> 29:26.590
What are you doing here?

29:26.590 --> 29:28.290
I'm here to take you to lunch.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.630
This is bad form, Walker,
and bad judgment.

29:30.630 --> 29:32.000
We shouldn't be seen together.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.330
Why is that?

29:33.330 --> 29:36.400
An ex-Texas Ranger taking
a pretty lawyer to lunch.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.900
It doesn't seem
suspicious to me.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.510
( elevator bell dings )

29:41.140 --> 29:43.070
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.210
So tell me, Walker,

29:44.210 --> 29:46.950
are you this extravagant
with all your dates?

29:46.950 --> 29:49.010
I like to make a strong
first impression.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.080
Well, I hate to imagine
where you end up.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.450
So, what's on your mind, Walker?

29:55.460 --> 29:56.890
Somehow I have the feeling

29:56.890 --> 29:59.220
you're not working your way
towards dinner and a movie.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.030
I wanna know
about the committee.

30:05.030 --> 30:07.330
It's not my place to tell you
anything about them.

30:07.330 --> 30:08.800
Look, you guys
are checking me out,

30:08.800 --> 30:10.500
so I think it's only fair
that I check you out

30:10.500 --> 30:11.570
before I make a decision.

30:13.140 --> 30:15.910
Besides, I got a feeling
something's bothering you

30:15.910 --> 30:16.940
about the committee.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.410
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:20.410 --> 30:22.310
Yes, you do.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.220
I was watching you
at the meeting.

30:24.220 --> 30:26.990
You don't seem to be
as committed as the rest of 'em.

30:26.990 --> 30:29.020
Understand this, Walker.

30:29.020 --> 30:30.620
It's a lifetime commitment.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.390
Once you're in, you're in.

30:32.390 --> 30:34.490
What if it doesn't
have to be?

30:34.490 --> 30:35.590
What if you had a choice?

30:38.930 --> 30:40.400
No.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.230
We shouldn't be talking
about this.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.470
Whatever's said here stays here.

30:48.710 --> 30:49.980
( sighs )

30:51.480 --> 30:53.340
Tell me, why'd you join?

30:56.050 --> 30:58.150
There's so much wrong
with the system, Walker.

30:58.150 --> 31:00.120
I mean, you're there.
You see it.

31:00.120 --> 31:04.060
The idea of justice.
It's just that. It's an idea.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.290
When you're in it day to day,

31:05.290 --> 31:08.090
sometimes you begin to forget
what the word means.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.190
Yeah, you're right.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.330
It's not a great system.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.670
But it could be a lot worse.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.730
Yeah, that's easy to say.

31:18.570 --> 31:20.340
You know, there are nights
when I come home,

31:20.340 --> 31:21.570
and I turn on the shower,

31:21.570 --> 31:24.280
and I stand under it
for what seems like hours,

31:24.280 --> 31:25.840
just trying to wash off
the dirt.

31:25.850 --> 31:28.850
When I heard about
the committee, it--

31:28.850 --> 31:31.250
It just seemed like
what the system needed.

31:31.250 --> 31:32.780
Another set
of checks and balances

31:32.790 --> 31:35.120
to plug up the holes that
are getting bigger day by day.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.260
How do you feel now?

31:37.260 --> 31:39.820
I don't know.

31:41.530 --> 31:42.860
I don't know
that what we're doing

31:42.860 --> 31:45.500
is any better than what
the criminals are doing.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.470
We form an opinion
about what's right and wrong,

31:47.470 --> 31:48.700
and we act on it.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.070
It's getting late, Walker.

31:52.070 --> 31:53.070
I gotta go.

31:53.070 --> 31:55.010
(<i> pensive theme playing</i> )

31:55.010 --> 31:57.480
Do me a favor, okay?

31:57.480 --> 31:59.180
Let's make this our last date.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.950
MAN ( on screen ):
<i> Come on, come on!</i>

32:07.960 --> 32:10.720

playing on screen )

WOMAN ( on screen ):
<i> I can't. I can't reach.</i>

32:13.090 --> 32:14.860
MAN:
<i> Take my hand.</i>
<i> Take my hand.</i>

32:16.030 --> 32:17.460
<i> Run!</i>

32:17.460 --> 32:18.730
<i> You got it.</i>
<i> You got it, baby.</i>

32:18.730 --> 32:20.800
(<i> woman gasps</i> )

32:20.800 --> 32:22.170
MAN:
<i> All right.</i>

32:22.170 --> 32:24.140
MAN 2:
<i> I see him.</i>
<i> He's up there.</i>

32:26.310 --> 32:27.810
<i> Let's go, cover me.</i>

32:27.810 --> 32:29.940
(<i> indistinct shouting</i> )

32:29.940 --> 32:31.810
(<i> clanking</i> )

32:33.350 --> 32:35.510
WALKER:
<i> Trivette, you there?</i>

32:35.520 --> 32:36.780
This is the good part.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.550
This is where Bruce Willis
actually loses

32:38.550 --> 32:40.550
to one of the bad guys,
man.

32:40.550 --> 32:43.860
Would you like for me
to come back later?

32:43.860 --> 32:46.490
No. No, no.

32:46.490 --> 32:49.060
How'd it go
with the public defender?

32:49.060 --> 32:51.460
I think she's having
second thoughts

32:51.470 --> 32:53.570
about her participation
in the committee.

32:53.570 --> 32:55.370
What makes you think that?

32:55.370 --> 32:58.100
She was just trying too hard
to convince herself

32:58.110 --> 32:59.800
that what she was doing
was right.

33:01.310 --> 33:03.380
And I don't think
she convinced herself.

33:03.380 --> 33:04.840
How do you know
she's not testing you,

33:04.840 --> 33:06.540
fishing for a reaction
or something?

33:06.550 --> 33:08.080
I just know.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.350
Well,
just to be on the safe side,

33:09.350 --> 33:10.720
why don't we just
bust these guys

33:10.720 --> 33:11.820
and get this thing over with.

33:11.820 --> 33:13.350
No.

33:13.350 --> 33:16.020
I wanna know who the voice
is behind that speaker box.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.120
I'll talk to you later.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.460
All right.

33:20.460 --> 33:23.230
Hey, I paid for that popcorn.
Go ahead and take it.

33:23.230 --> 33:24.330

33:24.330 --> 33:25.760

34:10.179 --> 34:11.580
<i> I'd like to take</i>
<i> this opportunity</i>

( applause )

34:19.219 --> 34:21.320

<i> I realize that this is not</i>

34:24.889 --> 34:27.219
<i> and that not all could attend,</i>

<i> Despite the absence</i>
<i> of some of our members,</i>

<i> We seem to have</i>
<i> a serious problem on our hands</i>

34:46.710 --> 34:48.250
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

34:48.250 --> 34:49.650
<i> It is regrettable,</i>

34:49.650 --> 34:51.150
<i> but I believe that Miss Dutton</i>

34:51.150 --> 34:53.790
<i> has become</i>
<i> a serious security risk.</i>

34:53.790 --> 34:56.350
<i> That not only puts</i>
<i> the committee at risk,</i>

34:56.360 --> 34:58.560
<i> but all of us individually.</i>

34:58.560 --> 35:01.260
The evidence in this file
is pretty weak.

35:01.260 --> 35:03.400
What makes her a security risk?

35:03.400 --> 35:06.000
<i> She's had some second thoughts,</i>

35:06.000 --> 35:07.170

35:07.170 --> 35:09.570
<i> We've had her phone tapped.</i>

35:09.570 --> 35:12.370
<i> You'll think otherwise</i>
<i> when you see the transcripts.</i>

35:12.370 --> 35:14.840
<i> It's time for a vote.</i>

35:14.840 --> 35:16.370
<i> Live or die?</i>

35:16.380 --> 35:18.480
Die.

35:20.850 --> 35:21.850
Die.

35:21.850 --> 35:24.150
Die.

35:24.150 --> 35:25.150
Die.

35:25.150 --> 35:27.120
Die.

35:28.990 --> 35:30.320

35:41.930 --> 35:43.500
Die...

35:43.500 --> 35:44.540
but I wanna do it.

35:46.670 --> 35:48.740
Well, thank you for the offer,

35:48.740 --> 35:51.510
but that's why
Mr. Strangis isn't here.

35:51.510 --> 35:54.380
He's standing by
to carry out the execution.

36:06.190 --> 36:07.830
Appreciate your enthusiasm,

36:07.830 --> 36:09.830
but there'll be
plenty of opportunities.

36:16.700 --> 36:18.300
( motorcycle starting )

36:27.110 --> 36:28.510
That's some kind of club
you joined.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.550
I can't wait to see
the Halloween party.

36:30.550 --> 36:31.950
Did you get a trace?

36:31.950 --> 36:33.590
Yeah, seven

Texas Rangers.
Our Turn Corporation,
where's that?

37:02.780 --> 37:04.820
Eighth floor, 810.

Candy-gram.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.750
Nobody in the shower.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.170
Just little old me
and the electronics.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.190
Hello.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.770
( distorted voice ):
<i> It is regrettable,</i>

38:32.770 --> 38:33.940
<i> but I believe that Miss Dutton</i>

38:33.940 --> 38:36.470
<i> has become</i>
<i> a serious security risk.</i>

38:36.480 --> 38:38.880
<i> That not only puts</i>
<i> the committee at risk,</i>

38:38.880 --> 38:41.850
<i> but all of us individually.</i>

38:41.850 --> 38:44.320
<i> It's time for a vote.</i>

38:44.320 --> 38:46.150
<i> Live or die?</i>

38:52.760 --> 38:53.960
<i> First of all,</i>

38:53.960 --> 38:55.690

38:59.670 --> 39:02.300
That's very, very nice.

Very nice.

Walker.

39:14.580 --> 39:16.180
Walker.

39:18.320 --> 39:19.920
I got your Mr. Big, man.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.050
Who is it?

39:21.050 --> 39:22.650
It's not "who."
It's a "what."

39:22.660 --> 39:24.290
It's a random access
computer voice

39:24.290 --> 39:26.290
with a multitrack
playback unit

39:26.290 --> 39:27.590
and a modem dialer.

39:27.590 --> 39:30.330
It's operated by a remote
from the other side.

39:30.330 --> 39:33.230
So, what he's got is a number
of preset responses

39:33.230 --> 39:34.670
on any one of the tracks.

39:34.670 --> 39:36.800
Whenever he needs it, he just
punches the right button.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.000
You mean, it's one of the guys
in the room?

39:39.010 --> 39:40.000
You got it.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.400
They kicked off
about ten minutes ago.

Yeah.

43:23.430 --> 43:26.430
That was exciting.
Yeah.

43:26.430 --> 43:29.070
I'm telling you, Walker...

43:29.070 --> 43:31.100
( indistinct conversations )

43:32.510 --> 43:35.040

we'd better get started.

43:55.900 --> 43:57.960
Well,
everyone's here but Strangis.

Does anyone know where he is?

44:02.940 --> 44:04.900
Oh?

Where might that be?

44:08.980 --> 44:10.240
Who the hell is that?

44:10.240 --> 44:11.840
That's my partner, Trivette.

44:11.850 --> 44:12.880
You're all under arrest.

44:17.350 --> 44:19.950
That's not very smart.

44:21.190 --> 44:22.220
You either.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.970
What a guy.

( police radio crackles
indistinctly )

44:50.380 --> 44:51.480
Hey, judge.

44:54.550 --> 44:56.620
Looks like you'll see the system
in action

44:56.620 --> 44:58.260
from the other side
of the bench this time.

44:58.260 --> 44:59.760
You need us, Walker.

44:59.760 --> 45:01.030
You can't do this alone.

45:01.030 --> 45:03.830
Well, we'll just have
to do the best we can, judge.

45:03.830 --> 45:04.830
Put him in.

45:08.230 --> 45:09.400
