WEBVTT

00:02.736 --> 00:04.472
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.706
SOMEBODY JUST DROPS BY,

00:05.739 --> 00:07.141
AND YOU'VE GOT
HOMEMADE COOKIES.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.209
YOU'RE AMAZING.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.810
- OH, YEAH, AMY,
I'M AMAZING.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.680
I CAN TURN ON THE OVEN
AND CUT UP A LOG OF DOUGH.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.516
- I NEVER GET THAT FAR.

00:15.549 --> 00:19.053
I JUST PEEL BACK THE PLASTIC
AND EAT IT LIKE A BANANA.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.222
- SO, AMY,
WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU, HMM?

00:21.255 --> 00:21.989
- WELL, I JUST GOT
THE CORNER OFFICE--

00:22.022 --> 00:24.125
- NO, NO, PAST THAT.
PAST THAT.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.759
GET TO THE GOOD STUFF,
THE DATING SCENE.

00:25.793 --> 00:28.496
- OH, YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO BACK THERE, DEB.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.698
I FEEL LIKE
I'M ONE OF THOSE THINGS

00:30.731 --> 00:32.300
ON THE SALAD BAR
THAT NOBODY TOUCHES

00:32.333 --> 00:34.168
'CAUSE IT'S BEEN SITTING
OUT THERE TOO LONG.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.070
- NO.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.406
COME ON; ALL YOU NEED
IS A LITTLE SPRITZ OF WATER.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.174
AND YOU SHOULD BE
MORE ASSERTIVE.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.343
- NAH, THAT'S NOT ME.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.079
MAYBE I'LL JUST WAIT
FOR ONE OF YOU GUYS.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.217
- HEY.
- HI, ROBERT.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.484
- HELLO.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.353
- OH, ROBERT,
THIS IS MY FRIEND AMY.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.122
WE USED TO WORK
AT THE P.R. FIRM TOGETHER.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.823
THIS IS ROBERT,
RAY'S BROTHER.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.791
- RAY'S BROTHER?
- MM.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.661
- LISTEN, DEBRA, ONCE AGAIN
IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR

01:00.694 --> 01:02.330
WHERE I HAVE TO ASK YOU

01:02.363 --> 01:04.398
TO LOOK DEEP INTO YOUR HEARTS
AND POCKETS

01:04.432 --> 01:06.267
TO PLEDGE
YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT

01:06.300 --> 01:08.169
FOR THOSE OF US
WHO RISK OUR LIVES FOR YOU.

01:08.202 --> 01:08.836
- YEAH, SURE, ROBERT.
HOW MUCH--

01:08.869 --> 01:11.372
- LET ME FINISH.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.841
YOUR $20 PLEDGE ENABLES US
TO UPGRADE OUR EQUIPMENT,

01:13.874 --> 01:16.177
FUND OUR COMMUNITY OUTREACH
PROGRAM,

01:16.210 --> 01:19.147
AND PROVIDE OUR CANINE DIVISION
WITH CRUNCHY TREATS.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.251
THANK YOU.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.686
- OH, I'VE GOT $20.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.226
- THANK YOU, MA'AM,
FOR YOUR GENEROSITY.

01:36.297 --> 01:40.301
YOUR CONTRIBUTION ENTITLES YOU
TO A REFLECTIVE DECAL.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.769
- THANK YOU.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.871
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
A POLICE OFFICER?

01:43.904 --> 01:45.439
- 15 YEARS.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.674
- ROBERT'S A SERGEANT.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.610
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL HER THAT.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.645
OH, YOU MADE COOKIES, HUH?
- UH-HUH.

01:51.679 --> 01:52.846
- I LOVE IT WHEN YOU BAKE.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.363
- SO YOU'RE A POLICE SERGEANT.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.665
YOUR WIFE MUST GET
WORRIED SICK ABOUT YOU.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.401
- WELL, NOT AS SICK
AS SHE USED TO.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.835
WE'RE DIVORCED.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.571
- OH.
I'M SORRY.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.641
- NO, NO.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.676
IT'S ALL FOR THE BEST.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.279
I'M MUCH HAPPIER NOW
THAN I USED TO BE.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.318
- I JUST HAVE
SO MUCH RESPECT

02:30.351 --> 02:32.486
FOR PEOPLE
IN YOUR LINE OF WORK.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.188
- AH, IT'S JUST
HOURS OF BOREDOM

02:34.222 --> 02:36.790
INTERRUPTED BY MOMENTS
OF UNBELIEVABLE HORROR.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.697
- HEY, OH,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.965
I GOT A LIGHT OUT
ON THE CEILING,

02:44.998 --> 02:45.899
AND I DON'T HAVE A LADDER.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.435
- SURE.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.603
- UH, NO, NO.
ROBERT, YOU STAY HERE.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.804
I'LL HELP YOU CHANGE IT.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.840
- YOU?
YOU'RE A SHRIMP.

02:52.873 --> 02:56.844
HOW MANY TIMES AM I GOING TO
HAVE TO THROW YOU UP THERE?

02:56.877 --> 02:58.979
- JUST COME HERE, RAY,
ALL RIGHT?

02:59.012 --> 03:01.749
- WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:01.782 --> 03:03.384
CAN'T YOU SEE THERE'S CHEMISTRY
HAPPENING IN THERE?

03:03.417 --> 03:04.818
- CHEMISTRY?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.820
OH, LOOK, ROBERT'S NOT READY
FOR CHEMISTRY, OKAY?

03:06.854 --> 03:09.923
HE COULD BLOW UP, NOW.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.992
HE'S STILL GUN-SHY
FROM HIS DIVORCE.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.728
- BUT IT'S BEEN A YEAR
SINCE HIS WIFE LEFT HIM.

03:14.762 --> 03:15.929
- SHE DIDN'T JUST LEAVE HIM.

03:15.963 --> 03:19.600
SHE LEFT HIM FOR A GUY
HE ARRESTED, OKAY?

03:19.633 --> 03:22.436
YOU DON'T GET OVER THAT FAST.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.972
NO, NO, NO.
THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.308
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.010
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.513
- [laughing]

03:32.546 --> 03:36.250
- SEE, NOW, THAT'S SAD.
SHE'S LAUGHING AT HIM.

03:36.284 --> 03:39.553
- - OKAY, AMY, I GUESS
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

03:39.587 --> 03:40.888
- THAT'D BE GREAT.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.990
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.692
- YEAH.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.694
- THANKS AGAIN FOR THE DECAL.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.330
- YEAH.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.604
- YOU OKAY, ROBERT?

03:59.507 --> 04:01.509
- YEAH.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.617
- I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
THAT HAPPY.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.390
- HEY, SQUIRT.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.692
- HEY, HOW YOU--
OH, HER.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.528
- HEY, DEBRA.
- HI, ROBERT.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.029
- I TALKED TO YOUR FRIEND
THIS EVENING,

04:22.062 --> 04:23.997
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE GOING OUT.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.867
- [gasps] OH, ROBERT,
THAT'S GREAT!

04:26.900 --> 04:27.901
GOOD FOR YOU!

04:27.935 --> 04:28.902
- I GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.971
- OH, COME ON.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.673
YOU'RE JUST NERVOUS 'CAUSE
YOU HAVEN'T DATED FOR A WHILE.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.408
- NAH, I'M NOT NERVOUS.
I JUST WANT OUT.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.410
- OH!

04:36.444 --> 04:37.745
- WELL, COME ON, YOU'VE GOT
PLENTY OF GOOD EXCUSES.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.046
YOU'RE A COP.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.749
HEY, HERE'S ONE.
TELL HER YOU GOT SHOT.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.618
[chuckles]

04:44.652 --> 04:46.387
- WOULD YOU SIT DOWN?
- HEY, NO, WHAT?

04:46.420 --> 04:47.588
- HE SHOULD GO OUT
WITH HER.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.390
- NO, NOT IF HE DOESN'T
LIKE HER, RIGHT?

04:49.423 --> 04:50.391
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF HE LIKES HER.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.393
- DO YOU LIKE HER, ROBERT?

04:52.426 --> 04:54.428
- I FELT A STIRRING.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.330
- THAT'S TERRIFIC.
YOU SHOULD.

04:56.364 --> 04:57.798
AMY'S A WONDERFUL GIRL.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.700
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT?

04:59.733 --> 05:00.934
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S JUST--
JUST THAT I'VE BEEN

05:00.968 --> 05:02.703
OUT OF THE LOOP
FOR A WHILE, YOU KNOW,

05:02.736 --> 05:06.674
AND, WELL, MOST OF THE WOMEN
I TALK TO ARE IN HANDCUFFS.

05:06.707 --> 05:10.611
AND THEN HALF OF THEM
TURN OUT TO BE MEN.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.046
- LISTEN, YOU'LL BE FINE.
JUST RELAX.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.548
- THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.816
- OH, LISTEN,
I GOT ADVICE FOR YOU.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.451
WHEN YOU PICK HER UP,

05:17.485 --> 05:19.420
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER
THAT YOU'RE OFF DUTY.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.854
YOU KNOW, SO, LIKE, WHEN YOU--

05:20.888 --> 05:22.656
WHEN OPEN UP
THE CAR DOOR FOR HER,

05:22.690 --> 05:24.124
DON'T PUSH HER HEAD DOWN
LIKE THIS.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.393
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.760
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.762
THAT'S GREAT, RAYMOND.
I APPRECIATE IT.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.499
- ROBERT, YOU HAVE
A FASCINATING JOB,

05:31.532 --> 05:32.733
SO JUST TALK ABOUT THAT,

05:32.766 --> 05:34.602
'CAUSE AMY'S OBVIOUSLY
INTERESTED.

05:34.635 --> 05:35.703
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
LISTEN, LISTEN.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.004
ON THE FIRST DATE,

05:37.037 --> 05:38.606
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU DO ON THE DATE.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.040
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO SAYING GOOD NIGHT.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.675
ARE YOU GOING TO KISS HER
GOOD NIGHT,

05:41.709 --> 05:43.110
OR IS IT GOING TO BE
A HANDSHAKE?

05:43.143 --> 05:45.413
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T ASSUME
THAT SHE WANTS A KISS.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.880
SO--SO--
WELL, THIS IS WHAT I DO.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.382
WHEN THE MOMENT ARRIVES,

05:48.416 --> 05:51.752
YOU KIND OF LEAN IN
A LITTLE, YOU KNOW?

05:51.785 --> 05:53.621
YEAH, YOU GOT TO SEE IF SHE'S
GOING TO RESPOND TO IT.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.922
DON'T GO TOO FAR, THOUGH,

05:54.955 --> 05:56.724
BECAUSE YOU REACH, LIKE,
A CERTAIN POINT,

05:56.757 --> 05:57.958
AND YOU GOT TO GO IN;
YOU'RE COMMITTED.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.827
AND THEN IF SHE'S NOT
EXPECTING A KISS,

05:59.860 --> 06:02.129
THEN YOU GOT TO WHISPER
SOMETHING IN HER EAR.

06:02.162 --> 06:05.666
"BOY, IT'S HUMID."

06:05.699 --> 06:07.401
- OKAY, I APPRECIATE
ALL THE ADVICE.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.803
THAT'S GREAT.
I--

06:09.837 --> 06:11.439
IT'S STILL NOT GOING TO HELP ME
WITH MY BIGGEST PROBLEM.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.840
- WHAT IS IT, ROBERT?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.742
- WELL, AMY'S A LOVELY GIRL,
YOU KNOW.

06:14.775 --> 06:18.178
SHE'S FEMININE,
DELICATE, ATTRACTIVE,

06:18.211 --> 06:20.681
AND, UM, LOOK AT ME.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.983
- OH!
- WELL--

06:23.016 --> 06:24.918
YOU REALLY CAN'T CHANGE THAT,
ROBERT.

06:24.952 --> 06:28.556
- OH.
RAY!

06:28.589 --> 06:30.057
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
ROBERT?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.159
YOU'RE A VERY GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.661
- AH, I'M THE HULK.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.996
- OH, COME ON.
COME ON, ROBERT.

06:36.029 --> 06:39.900
YOU'RE NOT...GREEN.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.769
- I'M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH MY APPEARANCE,

06:41.802 --> 06:42.836
NEVER HAVE BEEN.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.205
- YOU ARE BEING SILLY.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.674
I MEAN,
YOU'RE VERY ATTRACTIVE.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.542
YOU'RE TALL, DARK,
AND HANDSOME.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.877
THAT'S WHAT
EVERY WOMAN WANTS.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.812
- OH, DEBRA,
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.581
- NO, LISTEN.
I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT WAY.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.549
- YEAH, SEE?
THERE YOU GO, ROBERT.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.751
- YES, IN FACT,
OF ALL THE BARONES,

06:57.785 --> 06:59.520
I'D SAY THAT YOU ARE THE MOST--

07:04.024 --> 07:05.726
- WHAT?

07:05.759 --> 07:10.764
- THE M-MOST TALLEST
AND THE MOST D-DARKEST.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.136
- WHAT--WHAT WERE YOU
GOING TO SAY THERE?

07:16.169 --> 07:19.139
- NOTHING. I'M JUST TELLING
ROBERT HOW ATTRACTIVE HE IS.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.509
- THANK YOU, DEBRA.

07:24.111 --> 07:28.749
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A DATE WITH MISS AMY.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.655
- BOY, IT'S HUMID.

08:02.182 --> 08:05.052
- WOULD YOU TWO
LIKE TO BE ALONE?

08:05.085 --> 08:06.954
- I GOT AN INGROWN THING.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.523
I CAN'T, UH--
- YEAH.

08:09.557 --> 08:12.793
RAY, IS THIS BECAUSE OF
WHAT I SAID DOWNSTAIRS

08:12.826 --> 08:13.794
ABOUT ROBERT?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.262
- DOWNSTAIRS?
ABOUT ROBERT?

08:15.295 --> 08:16.897
SOMETHING ABOUT
HOW HANDSOME HE IS?

08:16.930 --> 08:19.767
HOW IF YOU COULD DO IT
ALL OVER AGAIN, YOU'D MARRY HIM?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.034
- NOW, COME ON.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.736
I NEVER SAID
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.705
- WELL, YOU WERE ABOUT TO,
BUT YOU STOPPED

08:24.738 --> 08:26.774
WHEN YOU SAW THE WARTHOG
YOU'RE STUCK WITH FOR LIFE

08:26.807 --> 08:29.577
SITTING NEXT TO YOU.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.078
- YOU DON'T THINK I THINK
YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE?

08:31.111 --> 08:33.213
- [gargles and spits]
I DO.

08:35.749 --> 08:36.950
I JUST--

08:36.984 --> 08:38.919
I NEVER KNEW THAT YOU THOUGHT
ROBERT WAS MORE ATTRACTIVE.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.721
- OH!

08:40.754 --> 08:42.623
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I GREW UP WITH ROBERT, OKAY.

08:42.656 --> 08:46.093
I'VE SEEN PARTS OF HIM
THAT AREN'T SO PRETTY.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.795
I'VE BEEN IN THE TUB
WITH THIS GUY.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.864
- HONEY.
LISTEN, I'M SORRY.

08:50.898 --> 08:54.167
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE
SO SENSITIVE ABOUT YOUR LOOKS.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.003
- WHO SAID THAT?
I NEVER SAID THAT.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.106
IT'S THE TEETH, RIGHT?

08:59.139 --> 09:01.108
- WHAT?
- YEAH, NOT ALL THE TEETH.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.777
THE TOP TEETH ARE OKAY,
BUT THE BOTTOM TEETH--

09:03.811 --> 09:05.178
LOOK.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.180
UGLY, RIGHT?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.782
- WELL, THAT.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.718
- YEAH, SEE?
I KNEW IT.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.586
- OH, RAY.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.256
- YOU KNOW,
I'M A LOT BETTER LOOKING

09:16.289 --> 09:18.025
WITH A SUNTAN.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.793
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

09:19.827 --> 09:23.296
- YOU SHOULDN'T LOOK AT MY FACE
WHEN IT'S RELAXED,

09:23.330 --> 09:25.032
'CAUSE I'M A LOT
BETTER LOOKING

09:25.065 --> 09:27.067
WHEN IT'S FLEXED.

09:31.171 --> 09:34.642
JUST, YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD
TO TALK LIKE THIS.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.210
- PLEASE KEEP IT FLEXED, THEN.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.650
LOOK, RAY, I'M REALLY SORRY.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.217
YOU KNOW, I JUST MISSPOKE.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.153
YOU'RE THE MORE ATTRACTIVE ONE.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.388
I MEAN THAT.
I REALLY DO.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.923
SO CAN WE JUST, YOU KNOW,

09:49.957 --> 09:52.025
FORGET THIS WHOLE THING,
ALL RIGHT?

09:52.059 --> 09:54.695
JUST GO TO SLEEP, OKAY?

09:54.728 --> 09:56.930
GOOD NIGHT.

10:01.201 --> 10:05.072
- IT'S THE PORES
ON MY NOSE, RIGHT?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.340
- THE PORES ON YOUR NOSE?

10:07.374 --> 10:09.242
- YEAH.
I GOT THESE PORES.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.944
THEY'RE LARGE.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.113
THEY'RE LARGE PORES.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.217
- THEY'RE REGULAR PORES, RAY.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.619
YOU JUST THINK THEY'RE LARGE
BECAUSE YOU--

10:21.188 --> 10:22.756
- BECAUSE?

10:22.790 --> 10:24.057
BECAUSE?

10:24.091 --> 10:26.426
BECAUSE THEY'RE ON
MY LARGE NOSE.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.195
- NO, NO, NO.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.363
NO, HONEY.
COME ON.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.032
COME HERE, BABY.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.134
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S OKAY, OKAY?

10:34.167 --> 10:36.169
I DON'T WANT YOUR PITY.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.280
- RAYMOND.
HELLO, DEAR.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.982
- HI, MA.
HERE.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.383
THANKS FOR THE THING HERE.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.685
- YOU'RE WELCOME,
SWEETHEART.

10:51.719 --> 10:52.953
YOU HUNGRY?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.755
- NO, NO, NO.
- NO?

10:57.991 --> 10:58.859
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
AT THE TOASTER FOR?

10:58.892 --> 11:00.293
YOU WANT SOME TOAST?
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.394
- I GOT RAISIN BREAD.

11:01.428 --> 11:04.164
- NO, MA, I'M NOT HUNGRY.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.999
LISTEN, MA.
- YEAH.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.134
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.368
- ANYTHING, DEAR.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.771
- HOW DO I LOOK TO YOU?

11:10.804 --> 11:12.339
- WHY?
ARE YOU SICK?

11:12.372 --> 11:14.307
- NO.
- OH, YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.843
- MA.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.745
- OH, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.080
OOH, YOU'RE PALE,
AND YOUR EYES ARE SUNKEN IN.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.749
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- NOTHING!

11:21.782 --> 11:23.016
- OH, DON'T LIE TO ME,
RAYMOND.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.417
YOU LOOK AWFUL.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.986
OH, HAVE SOME RAISIN TOAST.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.021
- MA, STOP IT.
I'M NOT SICK, OKAY?

11:28.055 --> 11:30.157
THIS IS HOW I ALWAYS LOOK.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.760
BUT THANK YOU.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.361
- SO THEN WHAT IS IT?

11:34.394 --> 11:38.098
- I WAS JUST--
I WAS WONDERING,

11:38.131 --> 11:39.132
BETWEEN ROBERT AND ME--

11:39.166 --> 11:40.367
- OOH, WHERE IS ROBERT?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.902
HE CALLED LAST NIGHT,

11:41.935 --> 11:42.870
AND HE SAID
HE WASN'T COMING HOME.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.137
- YEAH.
HE HAD A DATE.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.338
- HE DID?
- YEAH.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.840
- ROBERT HAD A DATE?

11:46.874 --> 11:49.009
WHOO-HOO-HOO!
WHO IS SHE?

11:49.042 --> 11:51.111
OH, I WOULD HAVE IRONED
HIS SHIRT FOR HIM.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.813
I MEAN, THEY COULD HAVE
EATEN HERE.

11:52.846 --> 11:53.914
I WOULD HAVE MADE
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.783
WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME
HE HAD A DATE?

11:55.816 --> 11:58.986
- BECAUSE OF THIS!

11:59.019 --> 12:01.088
- I'M GLAD HE HAD A DATE,
AT LEAST.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.389
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN
MOPING AROUND HERE

12:02.422 --> 12:03.423
EVER SINCE THE DIVORCE.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.958
I MEAN, SUCH A WASTE.

12:04.992 --> 12:07.928
OH, HE'S SUCH
A GOOD-LOOKING BOY.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.897
- SO YOU THINK SO TOO?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.932
- OF COURSE.
WHO DOESN'T?

12:11.965 --> 12:14.267
OH, EVERYBODY USED TO SAY

12:14.301 --> 12:17.237
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BOY
YOUR BROTHER WAS.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.240
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

12:20.273 --> 12:23.844
- WELL, YOU'RE ADORABLE.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.279
- ADORABLE?
LIKE A HAMSTER?

12:26.313 --> 12:30.050
- NO, LIKE A PERSON.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.219
BUT, OH, YOUR BROTHER
USED TO TURN HEADS.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.087
WHOO!

12:34.121 --> 12:37.090
HE ALWAYS HAD THAT SORT OF
OLD-FASHIONED MOVIE-STAR LOOK

12:37.124 --> 12:39.226
LIKE, UH, VALENTINO.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.828
- OH, SO I SEE.

12:40.861 --> 12:44.297
SO HE'S VALENTINO,
AND I'M FIEVEL.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.867
- OH, SWEETHEART.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.803
NO, BOTH OF MY BOYS
ARE GORGEOUS...

12:49.837 --> 12:52.005
IN THEIR OWN WAY.

12:52.039 --> 12:57.144
BUT I THINK THAT ROBERT SORT OF
TAKES AFTER ME A BIT MORE,

12:57.177 --> 12:59.079
WHEREAS YOU FAVOR
YOUR FATHER.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.848
- MARIE.
- YEAH.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.515
- MARIE.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.185
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A BUNION AND A CORN?

13:05.218 --> 13:06.519
- OH.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.388
DO YOU KNOW
THAT YOUR SON HERE

13:08.421 --> 13:09.489
DOESN'T THINK
HE'S GOOD-LOOKING?

13:09.522 --> 13:11.091
- OH, JUST STOP IT.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.826
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE NOT GOOD-LOOKING?

13:12.860 --> 13:14.928
YOU LOOK LIKE ME.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.596
- THERE YOU GO.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.565
DO YOU KNOW THAT ROBERT
IS STILL OUT ON HIS DATE

13:18.598 --> 13:19.833
FROM LAST NIGHT?

13:19.867 --> 13:21.101
- HEY, GREAT.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.170
BACK IN THE SADDLE, HUH?

13:23.203 --> 13:25.939
I WANT TO TURN HIS ROOM
INTO A STUDY.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.841
- A STUDY? WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO STUDY, YOUR FEET?

13:27.875 --> 13:29.042
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING, OKAY?

13:29.076 --> 13:30.343
THANKS, MOM.
- RAY.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.545
YOU SHOULDN'T BE JEALOUS
OF YOUR BROTHER.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.614
I MEAN, CONSIDER ALL
THE WONDERFUL THINGS YOU HAVE.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.016
- I KNOW. I KNOW. I KNOW.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.150
- ACTUALLY,
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD

13:37.184 --> 13:39.887
THAT YOU HAVE A BROTHER
WHO'S SO CLASSICALLY HANDSOME.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.290
- ROBERT'S CLASSICALLY HANDSOME?

13:43.323 --> 13:47.394
OH, WHAT WORLD ARE WE IN?

13:47.427 --> 13:49.196
- COME ON, RAY.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.431
EVERYBODY KNOWS ROBERT'S
THE LOOKER IN THE FAMILY.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.000
- EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS?

13:53.033 --> 13:54.467
ROBERT DIDN'T KNOW.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.003
- WELL, WE DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL HIM, DEAR,

13:56.036 --> 13:57.871
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO GET A BIG HEAD.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.173
- WE DIDN'T WANT
TO SCREW HIM UP.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.609
- WELL, THAT WORKED OUT WELL.

14:04.644 --> 14:08.415
- ROBERT!

14:08.448 --> 14:11.919
- ANY ONE OF YOU HAPPEN TO CATCH
THE SUNRISE THIS MORNING?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.954
BEAUTIFUL.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.356
- YOU HAD A DATE.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.225
- GOOD FOR YOU.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.993
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.461
IT'S LIKE RIDING A BIKE, HUH?

14:21.494 --> 14:24.397
- NO, NO,
THERE WAS NO CYCLING.

14:24.431 --> 14:27.167
AMY IS 100% LADY.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.402
WE SPENT THE EVENING
ENJOYING FINE FOOD,

14:29.436 --> 14:30.904
CONVERSATION,

14:30.938 --> 14:33.440
AND WE SPLIT A CLIP
AT THE SHOOTING RANGE.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.475
- WELL, GOOD, I'M GLAD
IT WORKED OUT FOR YOU.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.244
- WELL, HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT,
CUBBY?

14:39.079 --> 14:40.447
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.549
- YEAH, I KNOW.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.154
- WHAT'S WITH HIM?

14:47.187 --> 14:49.289
- HE'S JUST SENSITIVE.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.324
- YEAH, BUT HE'S
SUCH A GREAT KID.

14:51.358 --> 14:55.062
- OH, RAYMOND IS
THE KINDEST, SWEETEST BOY

14:55.095 --> 14:56.563
IN THE WORLD,

14:56.596 --> 15:00.533
THE KIND OF SON
THAT EVERY MOTHER HOPES FOR.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.936
- RIGHT.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.016
- OH, MAN.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.426
- HELLO.
- HI.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.128
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
LOOK AT THIS.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.963
CHOCOLATE PUDDING,
SPAGHETTI SAUCE,

15:29.997 --> 15:31.398
AND GRAPE JUICE.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.401
GOD, IT WAS LIKE
A PRISON RIOT IN HERE.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.735
THANK GOD
THEY'RE ALL ASLEE--

15:35.768 --> 15:40.273
[laughs]

15:48.181 --> 15:49.983
HONEY, WHAT DID YOU DO?

15:50.017 --> 15:52.085
- NOTHING, NOTHING.
WHAT?

15:52.119 --> 15:54.054
- WELL, I MEAN,
WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR?

15:54.087 --> 15:55.755
- IT'S MY NORMAL HAIR.
DON'T TOUCH IT.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.458
- AND YOU HAVE A TAN,
DON'T YOU?

15:58.491 --> 15:59.692
- NO, NO.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.394
- YOU DO!
- NO!

16:01.428 --> 16:03.430
- YOU WENT TO
ONE OF THOSE PLACES.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.266
- FOR--
FOR HEALTH REASONS.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.306
WHAT?
I LOOK GOOD, THOUGH, RIGHT?

16:13.440 --> 16:17.610
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NICE, BUT IT'S--

16:17.644 --> 16:19.379
I MEAN, WHAT IS THIS WHOLE--
WHAT WAS THAT?

16:19.412 --> 16:21.081
- NO, IT'S NOTHING.
THEY'RE NOTHING.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.582
THEY'RE NOTHING.
- LET ME SEE.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.385
- THEY'RE PERSONAL--
THEY'RE PERSONAL PRODUCTS.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.287
- OH, MY GOD.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.422
WHAT IS THIS?

16:29.456 --> 16:31.358
HAIR GEL.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.494
HAIR MOUSSE.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.996
HAIR VOLUMIZER?

16:38.498 --> 16:39.699
- HAIR VOLUMIZER.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.535
IT MAKES MY HAIR...LOUDER.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.672
- WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF?

16:45.705 --> 16:48.408
DEEP PORE CLEANSER.

16:48.441 --> 16:51.111
CLARIFYING LOTION?

16:51.144 --> 16:52.612
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT THIS STUFF IS FOR?

16:52.645 --> 16:55.182
- WELL, THAT'S WHY I GOT
THE CLARIFIER.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.052
- GOD, THEY SAW YOU COMING,
HONEY.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.321
- NO, THEY DIDN'T.
I--THEY'RE EXPERTS IN THERE.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.756
THEY ALL HAD LAB COATS ON.

17:05.558 --> 17:08.295
I THOUGHT ALL THIS STUFF
WAS FOR WOMEN,

17:08.328 --> 17:11.131
BUT THEY GOT A WHOLE LINE
OF CRAP FOR MEN.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.502
- RAY, YOU ARE COMPLETELY
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.370
I SAY ONE THING
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER,

17:17.404 --> 17:20.773
AND YOU TURN INTO
GEORGE HAMILTON.

17:26.313 --> 17:30.583
- YEAH, OKAY,
BUT I LOOK BETTER NOW, RIGHT?

17:30.617 --> 17:32.385
YEAH, SEE?

17:32.419 --> 17:35.255
STILL NOT AS GOOD
AS ROBERT, RIGHT?

17:35.288 --> 17:37.157
- AS GOOD AS ROBERT?

17:37.190 --> 17:39.292
- YOU SAID THAT HE WAS
THE HANDSOME ONE.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.228
- WELL, YES,
ROBERT'S HANDSOME,

17:41.261 --> 17:44.197
BUT HE'S NOT
WHO I'M ATTRACTED TO.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.533
- WELL, THEN WHO IS IT?

17:48.835 --> 17:50.803
- IT USED TO BE YOU, RAY.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.605
I MEAN, COME ON.

17:52.639 --> 17:56.376
WHAT, DO YOU THINK ALL OF THIS
STUFF MAKES YOU SEXY?

17:56.409 --> 17:59.112
THIS STUFF IS NOT YOU, RAY,
YOU KNOW?

17:59.146 --> 18:00.713
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.284
I WANT MY REGULAR RAY.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.686
THAT'S THE RAY
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

18:08.588 --> 18:13.426
- ARE YOU SAYING, THEN,
THAT I'M SEXY?

18:25.505 --> 18:29.476
I THINK I MIGHT NEED
A LITTLE MORE CONVINCING.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.478
- OKAY.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.681
OH, MY GOD.

18:34.714 --> 18:38.318
WHO DID YOUR HAIR,
JIFFY LUBE?

18:38.351 --> 18:41.154
- THAT'S THE DELUXE
FINISHER MODEL.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.425
- YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL LIKE
DOING RIGHT NOW?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.327
- YEAH?

18:47.360 --> 18:49.862
HEY, I GOT SOMETHING
FOR THAT TOO.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.532
- I FOUND OUR SONG
THE OTHER DAY.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.467
- SONG?
- MM-HMM.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.169
- WHAT?
OH, NO.

18:56.203 --> 18:59.372
["I'll Take You There" plays]

18:59.406 --> 19:01.608
NO, NO.
NO DANCING.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.510
- COME ON, RAY.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.844
WHOO!

19:06.479 --> 19:08.581
COME ON, BABY.
MOVE IT.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.651
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME
TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.486
- [laughs]
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:13.520 --> 19:16.756
I HEAR ROBERT IS
A VERY GOOD DANCER.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.334
OH, YEAH.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.370
- YOU KNOW, IN MY DAY,

19:30.403 --> 19:32.805
DANCING USED TO LEAD
TO SOMETHING.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.874
- OH, WELL, WE'LL SEE.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.576
HEY, COME ON.
GIVE ME YOUR MOVE.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.810
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.847
- ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME ROOM.
STAND BACK.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.349
- OW!

19:46.486 --> 19:48.788
OOH.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.524
AW!
YEAH, BABY.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.859
WHOO!

19:52.892 --> 19:55.695
[laughs]

19:55.728 --> 19:58.565
OH, AND TO THINK
YOU DOUBTED YOURSELF.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.470
- SO YOU PUT THIS
ON YOUR FACE, HUH?

20:03.503 --> 20:07.740
- YEAH, YEAH.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.542
YOU JUST--YOU KIND OF
DAB IT UNDER YOUR EYES.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.278
- LET ME ASK YOU,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:11.311 --> 20:12.512
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT, HUH?

20:12.545 --> 20:13.746
- OH, WOW.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.681
THAT'S GOT A LITTLE GIDDYAP
TO IT.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.383
- YEAH.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.650
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:17.684 --> 20:19.018
DON'T--DON'T SPRAY IT
ON YOUR WRIST.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.421
WHAT YOU DO IS,
YOU SPRAY IT IN THE AIR,

20:21.454 --> 20:24.557
AND THEN YOU JUST KIND OF
WALK THROUGH IT.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.742
- YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
THIS DRY PATCH HERE.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.577
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
THAT COULD HELP ME WITH THAT?

20:46.078 --> 20:48.481
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
A LITTLE FLAKINESS.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.784
- EXFOLIANT.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.820
- EXFOLIANT.
YEAH, YEAH.
