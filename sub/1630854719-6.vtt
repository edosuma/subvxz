WEBVTT

01:13.865 --> 01:15.784
Henry, give me the gun.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.452
Come on, give me the gun.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.536
What did I do?

01:19.579 --> 01:20.538
Gimme the gun.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.874
Gimme the gun, Henry.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.417
Gimme the gun.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.419
Henry, no!

02:27.188 --> 02:28.731
And the gun.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.234
Who the hell are you?

02:31.234 --> 02:33.778
Just someone passin' through.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.991
Take the gun out, two fingers only,
put it outta reach.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.500
Why didn't you shoot him?

02:47.500 --> 02:49.752
The gun's all the way over there.

02:51.170 --> 02:54.841
- He didn't hurt me, by the way.
- Yeah, I got eyes.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.176
You made him soup?

02:57.176 --> 02:59.387
Yeah, I did.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.931
- It's cold out.
- I'm lookin' for my brother.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.644
- Well, I ain't seen him.
- I haven't told you what he looks like.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.813
- He look anything like you?
- A bit.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.190
- Then I ain't seen him.
- He's got a girl with him.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.026
Can I come down?

03:13.693 --> 03:15.612
No. Ellie!

03:19.073 --> 03:20.700
What did I just say?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.452
Joel, come on.
They're like a thousand.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.371
- Who's this little psycho?
- Never mind her.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.915
I need you to tell us where we are.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.541
If you got a map, why you lost?

03:28.541 --> 03:31.127
Must've missed all the street signs
in the enormous fucking forest.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.128
Ho-ly.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.884
We're somewhere here.
Exactly where?

03:37.884 --> 03:40.261
And your answer better be
the same as your wife's.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.847
Did you tell him the truth?

03:42.847 --> 03:44.098
Yeah.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.434
Are you tellin' me the truth?

03:46.434 --> 03:47.894
Yeah.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.202
Well, you found
a great place to hide, I guess.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.161
Hide?

04:05.912 --> 04:08.164
Came here before you were born, sonny.

04:08.164 --> 04:11.334
- Get the hell away from everybody.
- I didn't want to.

04:14.253 --> 04:16.506
Listen, I didn't mean to upset you
about your brother,

04:16.506 --> 04:18.091
but if you've come this far,

04:18.091 --> 04:20.301
then you know what's out there.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.053
- You seen Cody?
- Yeah, got close enough.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.513
It's crawling with Infected.

04:23.513 --> 04:27.058
Yeah, Laramie and Wind River Reservation.

04:27.058 --> 04:30.061
Anywhere people used to be,
you can't go there no more.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.814
- So you haven't heard the name Tommy?
- Nope.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.023
What about the Fireflies?

04:34.023 --> 04:35.900
We get those in the summer.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.902
Not the bugs, the people.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.278
There are firefly people?

04:43.282 --> 04:46.995
- You got any advice on the best way west?
- Yeah.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.706
Go east.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.459
But you never go past the river here.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.588
- Ever.
- What's past the river?

04:57.588 --> 04:58.798
Death.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.426
We never seen who's out there,

05:01.426 --> 05:04.554
but we see the bodies they leave behind.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.807
Some Infected, some not.

05:08.307 --> 05:12.228
If your brother's west of the river,
he's gone.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.568
You're not gonna scare us.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.695
Scared him.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.627
You don't seriously believe them.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.129
They've lived here a long time.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.216
- Put that back.
- They don't know anything.

05:42.216 --> 05:43.760
Never heard of the Fireflies.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.975
Joel? Joel?

05:50.975 --> 05:52.143
Joel, are you okay?

05:52.143 --> 05:53.561
- Joel?
- Shut up.

05:53.561 --> 05:54.687
Holy shit, are you dying?

05:55.688 --> 05:56.731
I'm okay.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.900
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, are you okay?

05:58.900 --> 06:00.234
- I'm fine.
- No, no, but are you?

06:00.234 --> 06:02.236
Because just a reminder
that if you're dead, I'm fucked.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.613
- I said I'm fine.
- Okay.

06:04.781 --> 06:08.493
It's just the cold air all of a sudden.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.331
All right.

06:14.624 --> 06:18.252
So let's go and find Tommy
and the Fireflies.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.838
It's gonna be easy.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.966
All we have to do
is cross the River of Death.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.537
The River of Death. Scary.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.540
Don't start.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.835
It's too close to dark.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.211
There's some caves along the river.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.463
We'll set up camp there,
cross in the mornin'.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.132
Good. I'm starving.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.383
Should've stolen two rabbits.

07:05.383 --> 07:06.801
We can get our own rabbits.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.219
You gonna teach me how?

07:09.387 --> 07:10.930
Just keep movin'.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.878
Come down from there.
You're gonna break your neck.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.809
Can I have some?

07:56.809 --> 07:58.728
- No.
- What? Just to warm up.

07:58.728 --> 07:59.896
C'mon.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.037
Yep, still gross.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.214
So I've been thinking.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.259
Let's say we find the Fireflies,
it all works,

08:30.259 --> 08:32.470
they draw my blood and put it through

08:32.470 --> 08:34.847
some of their fancy machines
and make a cure.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.183
Okay?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.392
Then what?

08:39.602 --> 08:41.812
- Like, what do we do?
- It's "we"?

08:42.605 --> 08:45.066
Okay, fine. Whatever. You.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.276
You can do anything you want.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.737
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

08:50.696 --> 08:52.198
It's never been an option.

08:53.783 --> 08:54.909
Maybe

08:56.118 --> 08:58.663
an old farmhouse, some land

08:59.330 --> 09:00.498
a ranch.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.250
Cool. What kind?

09:03.000 --> 09:03.918
Sheep.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.587
- I would raise sheep.
- Sheep.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.048
They're quiet

09:09.715 --> 09:11.092
do what they're told.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.718
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.806
So, just you and a buncha sheep.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.808
Romantic.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.480
And what about you?
Where are you gonna go?

09:31.153 --> 09:33.447
It's probably because I grew up in the QZ.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.907
Behind you, there's ocean,

09:34.907 --> 09:37.159
and ahead of you, there's a wall.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.786
Nowhere else to look but up.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.914
I read everything I could
in the school library.

09:41.914 --> 09:45.209
Neil Armstrong,
Buzz Aldrin, Jim Lovell.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.586
But you know who my favorite is?

09:46.586 --> 09:50.214
- Sally Ride.
- Sally fuckin' Ride!

09:50.881 --> 09:52.800
Best astronaut name ever.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.148
It'll work, right?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.275
The vaccine?

10:10.234 --> 10:12.445
It's a little late to start wonderin'.

10:13.612 --> 10:16.782
- I tried, with Sam.
- Tried what?

10:16.782 --> 10:19.035
I knew he was infected.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.370
I rubbed some of my blood into his bite.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.830
I know, I know, it was stupid.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.040
But I

10:27.043 --> 10:28.336
I wanted to save him.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.177
Well, I reckon it's a lot
more complicated than that.

10:36.844 --> 10:40.598
Marlene, she's a lotta things,
but she's no fool.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.559
If she says they can do it,
they can do it.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.944
You wanna take first watch or second?

10:55.029 --> 10:56.655
I'll do both.

10:56.655 --> 10:58.074
Get some sleep.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.952
Dream of

11:03.079 --> 11:05.414
sheep ranches on the moon.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.291
I will.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.813
Still mumbling in your sleep.

11:29.563 --> 11:30.981
I woke up early.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.608
You were passed out,
so I took second watch.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.110
You gotta wake me up if that happens.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.571
- You can't do things like this.
- But I can.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.490
'Cause I just did.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.867
I'm responsible for you, okay?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.411
Then don't fall asleep.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.956
I was quiet, I checked my six,

11:46.956 --> 11:49.291
I looked for tracks,
I found the high ground,

11:49.291 --> 11:50.584
and I kept watch.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.711
Like you taught me to.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.881
What can I say, man?
I'm a natural.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.562
You wake me up next time.

12:10.729 --> 12:11.856
Yes, sir.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.373
The River of Death. Still no people.

12:30.499 --> 12:31.417
Fine.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.686
I'm learning how to whistle.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.812
You don't know how to whistle?

13:34.313 --> 13:35.731
Does it sound like
I know how to whistle?

13:35.731 --> 13:36.607
No.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.612
Seriously, though,
how the fuck do you do that?

13:41.612 --> 13:43.531
- Talent.
- Whatever.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.990
You should teach me how to hunt.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.242
Huh.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.578
"Huh." Like, "She's a girl.
She can't handle it."

13:50.246 --> 13:51.789
You can handle the shootin'.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.459
- Not so sure about the dressin'.
- What's the dressin'?

13:55.459 --> 13:58.087
- The part where you take the guts out.
- Oh, yeah.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.505
Why do they call it dressing?

13:59.505 --> 14:01.840
It's like, you should call it undressing

14:01.840 --> 14:03.634
'cause it is. It's like

14:03.634 --> 14:06.262
undressing from the inside.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.724
Still interested, though.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.403
Dam.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.030
You're no Will Livingston.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.032
Yeah, yeah, but who is?

14:28.242 --> 14:30.661
- So that made electricity?
- Yeah.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.539
Don't ask me.
I don't have a clue.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.500
You know, you could've
just made something up.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.793
I would've believed you.

14:39.336 --> 14:42.881
Look at that river.
It's crazy blue.

14:49.888 --> 14:53.642
Hey, Joel, what if this
is the River of Death?

15:23.380 --> 15:24.715
Get behind me.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.220
We ain't lookin' for any trouble.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.930
We're just passin' through.

15:31.930 --> 15:32.890
Drop the gun.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.236
You

15:47.112 --> 15:48.322
take five steps back.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.782
How 'bout we just talk this through?

15:49.782 --> 15:50.991
How 'bout you shut the fuck up?

15:50.991 --> 15:52.618
Okay, easy.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.416
You'll be okay.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.337
You been near Infected?

16:03.337 --> 16:04.505
There's no Infected out here.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.714
The hell there ain't.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.429
Last chance for a bullet.

16:13.472 --> 16:17.184
If you've been infected, he will smell it
and he will rip you up.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.288
Like I said, we'll just move on.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.874
Now her.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.739
Hi. Hi!

17:13.198 --> 17:14.116
Hi.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.501
You just bought yourself
10 more seconds.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.336
What are you doin' out here?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.548
I'm just lookin' for my brother.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.133
That's all, nothin' more.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.141
What's your name?

17:41.810 --> 17:42.895
Joel.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.848
Tommy!

19:29.459 --> 19:31.003
What the fuck you doin' here?

19:32.754 --> 19:34.673
I came here to save you.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.361
There's more if you need it.

19:56.945 --> 19:57.863
Thank you, ma'am.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.449
It's been a while
since we've had a proper meal.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.284
Actually, I don't think
I've ever had a proper meal.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.911
This is fuckin' amazing.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.413
Sorry.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.456
Ellie,

20:07.456 --> 20:09.124
let's mind our manners.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.464
What?

20:16.757 --> 20:18.926
- What's wrong with you?
- What about her manners?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.802
She was just curious.

20:20.802 --> 20:23.096
Kids around here
don't usually look or talk like you.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.807
Right, well, maybe I'll teach them.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.353
And I want my gun back.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.188
They also aren't armed.

20:32.022 --> 20:32.898
You know what?

20:34.232 --> 20:36.318
I think maybe y'all got a little off
on the wrong foot.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.819
She was gonna have her guys kill us.

20:37.819 --> 20:40.072
Well, we gotta be real careful
about who we let in this place.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.698
But it's all bark.
We're just tryna scare off

20:41.698 --> 20:43.200
those who might wanna try us is all.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.576
Well, you got a couple of 90-year-olds

20:44.576 --> 20:46.370
- shitting themselves out there.
- Ellie.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.080
They say that you leave
dead bodies around?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.456
Those are the people who tried us.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.125
A bad reputation doesn't mean you're bad.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.127
Not always, at least.

20:58.715 --> 20:59.633
Ma'am,

21:00.509 --> 21:02.844
we're grateful for
your hospitality and all.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.723
But it'd be nice to have a moment here,
maybe just for family.

21:09.476 --> 21:10.394
Well

21:12.104 --> 21:14.940
Maria is family, actually.

21:16.274 --> 21:18.819
Oh, shit! Congrats.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.782
Joel, say congrats.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.161
Congrats.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.168
- How 'bout a tour?
- Yeah.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.505
We settled here about seven years ago.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.215
Just a handful of us back then.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.509
That section was already
a gated community,

21:42.509 --> 21:44.970
so we built the rest of the wall
out from there.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.307
Stopped most of the raiding parties,
but we still find pockets of them.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.184
- And you said Infected?
- Yeah, but usually smaller colonies,

21:51.184 --> 21:52.477
wandered off from the cities.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.396
All this open country out here,

21:54.396 --> 21:56.106
it's a turkey shoot.

21:56.106 --> 21:59.109
I still got my 700,
but I found a variable power scope.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.736
Sub-MOA.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.612
Can headshot those fuckers
from a half mile out.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.240
- Can you teach me how?
- No, he can't.

22:06.033 --> 22:08.368
- How do you keep this place quiet?
- Carefully.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.494
Being in the middle of nowhere helps.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.039
Not advertising what we have,
staying off the radio.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.708
House of worship, multifaith.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.044
School. Laundry.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.838
Old bank works as the jail,
not that we've needed it.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.465
And you draw power from the dam?

22:21.465 --> 22:23.383
Got that workin' a couple years ago.

22:23.383 --> 22:26.470
After that, sewage, plumbing,
water heaters,

22:26.470 --> 22:27.637
lights.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.765
This place actually fuckin' works.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.352
Hey, Joel, check it.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.693
So are you, like, in charge?

22:41.693 --> 22:43.779
No one person's in charge.

22:43.779 --> 22:44.988
I'm on the council.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.323
Democratically elected,

22:46.323 --> 22:48.575
serving 300 people, including children.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.826
Everyone pitches in.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.953
We rotate patrols, food prep, repairs,

22:51.953 --> 22:53.330
hunting, harvesting.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.373
Everything you see in our town,

22:55.373 --> 22:58.543
greenhouses, livestock, all shared.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.961
Collective ownership.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.172
So, communism.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.633
Nah.
Nah, it ain't like that.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.218
It is that. Literally.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.594
This is a commune.
We're communists.

23:09.262 --> 23:12.182
- No way!
- That's our newest one.

23:13.016 --> 23:14.392
Couple months old.
You wanna pet her?

23:14.392 --> 23:16.144
- Yeah, what's her name?
- Shimmer.

23:16.144 --> 23:18.271
Shimmer. You're so beautiful.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.690
Well, I'm sure they'd like a shower,
some new clothes.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.818
We can put them in the empty house
cross the street from us.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.986
Yeah. It's a decent place.

23:24.986 --> 23:27.781
Pretty much untouched since '03,
but it's got the heat goin' in it.

23:27.781 --> 23:30.534
- Could do worse.
- Trust me, we have been.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.327
We've been doin' fine.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.167
Well, I'll take Ellie over there
if you two wanna catch up?

23:41.461 --> 23:42.379
Yeah. Okay.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.466
- Joel.
- You'll be fine.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.344
Shall we?

23:50.262 --> 23:51.179
Yeah.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.979
Been a long time.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.652
Doesn't seem like you aged much.

24:05.652 --> 24:06.903
You, on the other hand.

24:13.034 --> 24:14.870
Thanks for still givin' a shit about me.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.129
Workin' on raisin' some hogs, too.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.048
Once we get bacon,
I mean, what's even left?

24:29.759 --> 24:31.595
Christmas trees and bacon?

24:31.595 --> 24:33.638
Pretty decent setup.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.057
So how's Tess?

24:38.059 --> 24:39.436
She's fine.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.646
- All right.
- Good then.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.149
And the kid?

24:46.109 --> 24:47.652
Oh, yeah.

24:48.778 --> 24:51.364
She's the daughter
of some Firefly muckety-muck.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.451
Tryna find her family somewhere out here.

24:55.076 --> 24:57.537
- I was headin' in this direction, so.
- Really?

24:58.496 --> 24:59.539
Goodness of your heart?

25:00.582 --> 25:01.666
There's a payment.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.339
So you know where they might be?
These Fireflies?

25:07.339 --> 25:10.508
Well, they got a base down at
the University of Eastern Colorado.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.970
It's a week's ride south.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.265
But it is severely fucked up
between here and there.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.727
Infected, raiders.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.437
It's not exactly an easy trip.

25:22.437 --> 25:25.190
It'll be easy for us, seeing as how
you can headshot Infected

25:25.190 --> 25:26.358
from half a mile away,

25:26.358 --> 25:28.568
which is a bunch
of bullshit, by the way.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.197
- Yeah, I can't go.
- Come on.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.657
I made it across the country.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.951
The two of us can make it
from here to Colorado.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.998
What, 'cause your wife won't let you?

25:41.998 --> 25:44.542
- Joel.
- She the one who kept you off the radio?

25:44.542 --> 25:46.336
Is that why you stopped messaging me back?

25:46.336 --> 25:49.464
After I ditched the Fireflies,
Maria and her crew found me.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.758
They're good people.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.261
They didn't have to take me in,
but they did.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.012
And all they ask
is that I follow their rules.

25:56.012 --> 25:58.431
- I'm your brother.
- Yeah, I'm aware.

26:00.016 --> 26:02.185
They're very protective of this place,

26:02.185 --> 26:03.561
and for good fuckin' reason.

26:03.561 --> 26:06.356
- Folks find out we're up here--
- No, I heard.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.400
Wrong people might show up.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.111
So is that what I am?
Am I the wrong people?

26:11.111 --> 26:12.821
- Joel--
- Those things I did, Tommy,

26:12.821 --> 26:14.614
those things that you judge me for,

26:14.614 --> 26:16.199
I did those things to keep us alive.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.659
We did those things.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.411
And they weren't "things."

26:20.328 --> 26:21.288
We murdered people.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.999
And I don't judge you for it.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.085
We survived the only way we knew how.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.087
But there were other ways.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.215
We just weren't any good at 'em.

26:32.215 --> 26:33.758
If you knew the shit
that I've been through,

26:33.758 --> 26:35.635
Tommy, tryin' to find you these
last few months--

26:35.635 --> 26:37.220
I'm gonna be a father.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.682
Maria's a few months along now.

26:42.183 --> 26:44.102
So I just gotta be more careful.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.818
To be honest,
I'm scared to death.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.450
But I don't know.
I feel like I'd be a good dad.

27:04.497 --> 27:06.249
Guess we'll find out.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.713
"I guess we'll find out"?

27:11.713 --> 27:14.674
- That's all you got?
- What else am I supposed to say?

27:19.471 --> 27:21.598
Just because life stopped for you

27:23.058 --> 27:25.393
doesn't mean it has to stop for me.

27:31.608 --> 27:35.111
We'll grab some supplies
and be outta your hair in the mornin'.

29:25.680 --> 29:26.764
Gross.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.000
Hello?

30:03.218 --> 30:04.344
Maria?

30:39.212 --> 30:40.547
Oh, good.

30:41.297 --> 30:43.758
Just traded for this.
Go ahead, try it on.

30:50.765 --> 30:52.600
It's super fuckin' purple.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.602
- Eggplant. It fits?
- Yeah.

30:54.602 --> 30:57.021
- Shoes aren't too big?
- No.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.399
- Where's my other stuff?
- Rag pile.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.150
- Did you get the thing I left you?
- Yeah.

31:01.150 --> 31:03.570
- Weirdest gift ever.
- But useful.

31:04.112 --> 31:07.407
- Who's been cutting your hair?
- World-class salons.

31:08.366 --> 31:09.659
Let me get my scissors.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.327
- No. I'm--
- Trim. That's all.

31:11.327 --> 31:13.329
Just the ends, I promise.

31:16.791 --> 31:19.544
So, this was, like,
your job back then or something?

31:20.044 --> 31:24.674
No, I was an Assistant District Attorney
out of Omaha, Nebraska.

31:26.092 --> 31:27.427
I put bad guys in jail.

31:28.678 --> 31:29.846
Cool, I guess.

31:29.846 --> 31:33.600
I always liked doing hair, though.
Maybe it was a mom thing.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.769
You were looking at the little memorial
Tommy made?

31:37.687 --> 31:38.521
Yeah.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.568
- I'm sorry about your kids.
- It's okay.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.111
And kid. Just Kevin.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.864
Sarah was Joel's daughter.

31:52.785 --> 31:56.122
- Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, it's okay.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.418
I guess that explains him a little.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.670
Look, I'm not gonna ask you
what you're doing with him.

32:02.670 --> 32:03.630
Good.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.548
But there are clearly things
you don't know about Joel.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.551
Like how he used to kill people?
I know about that.

32:10.887 --> 32:13.056
- So then you understand my concern.
- He doesn't do that anymore.

32:13.056 --> 32:15.933
- He stopped killing people?
- Innocent ones.

32:15.933 --> 32:18.311
And Tommy did it, too.
Are you worried about him?

32:21.522 --> 32:23.316
Tommy was following Joel.

32:23.316 --> 32:26.361
- The way you are now.
- Well, maybe I'm smarter than Tommy.

32:26.361 --> 32:27.612
No offense.

32:28.529 --> 32:29.864
You are definitely smart.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.033
Would've made a hell of a lawyer.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.912
There's a whole lot you're not telling me.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.081
Good.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.917
Therein lies the point.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.920
Be careful who you put your faith in.

32:44.629 --> 32:48.174
The only people who can betray us,
are the ones we trust.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.095
You understand?

32:55.640 --> 32:56.516
Now, come on.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.935
Grab your super fuckin' eggplant coat.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.354
- Where are we going?
- The movies.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.319
<i>Elliot Garfield.
I'm moving into the other room.</i>

33:09.570 --> 33:12.824
<i>Yeah. I'm a friend of Tony's,
you know, Tony DeForrest.</i>

33:14.242 --> 33:15.243
<i>That's nice.</i>

33:16.119 --> 33:17.286
<i>I'm an actor, too.</i>

33:18.204 --> 33:19.455
<i>Yeah?</i>

33:19.455 --> 33:21.457
<i>Well, your mother knows.</i>

33:21.457 --> 33:22.875
<i>I see.</i>

33:24.460 --> 33:25.586
<i>Well</i>

33:26.838 --> 33:28.840
<i>guess I'll be seeing you around.</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:31.426
- <i>I guess so.</i>
- <i>Night.</i>

33:34.595 --> 33:36.139
<i>Just met Lucy.</i>

33:36.139 --> 33:37.640
<i>What did you tell her?</i>

33:37.640 --> 33:39.016
<i>That I was moving into the other room.</i>

33:39.016 --> 33:40.560
<i>She seemed to take it in stride.</i>

33:58.244 --> 33:59.996
The guys said I might find you here.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.209
Figured I'd save you the trouble.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.345
I shouldn't have said what I said.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.515
I don't even believe it.

34:21.142 --> 34:23.478
I know you're happy for me.
It just--

34:24.854 --> 34:26.481
It's complicated for you

34:27.148 --> 34:28.483
and I'm sorry.

34:31.986 --> 34:33.571
So you gonna let me
off the hook, or what?

34:33.571 --> 34:36.574
This ride to the University,
is it a suicide mission?

34:37.116 --> 34:38.367
No.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.953
It's dangerous,
but it's nothin' you can't handle.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.288
Just prepare and do what you do.

34:42.288 --> 34:44.415
You've had people go that way
and come back?

34:44.415 --> 34:45.625
All of 'em.

34:46.667 --> 34:47.794
What is this?

34:51.214 --> 34:52.548
She's immune.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.636
- What?
- Ellie.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.055
She got infected but she didn't get sick.

34:59.972 --> 35:00.890
Tommy.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.019
Tommy, I saw her get bit myself.

35:05.019 --> 35:07.230
That was months ago. Months.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.607
She's immune.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.878
From the beginning.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.300
<i>It was Marlene.</i>

35:36.968 --> 35:39.679
<i>She hired us to smuggle her
to some Fireflies.</i>

35:40.388 --> 35:41.722
<i>It went bad.</i>

35:42.515 --> 35:43.850
<i>Tess got bit.</i>

35:45.268 --> 35:47.186
<i>She made me swear to take the kid.</i>

35:48.813 --> 35:49.897
<i>It was her dyin' wish.</i>

35:49.897 --> 35:51.899
<i>What the hell was I supposed to do?</i>

35:53.609 --> 35:56.153
<i>We made it as far as K.C., and then--</i>

35:57.238 --> 35:59.740
You know, she saved my life there

35:59.740 --> 36:01.367
from another kid.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.745
Five years ago, I would've destroyed him.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.999
But she had to shoot him to save me.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.625
Fourteen years old.

36:10.209 --> 36:14.130
Because I was too slow
and too fuckin' deaf to hear him comin'.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.259
And I saw

36:20.887 --> 36:22.889
I saw a man kill his own brother

36:23.890 --> 36:26.809
to save her, while I just watched.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.312
And today, I thought that dog
was gonna tear her apart

36:29.312 --> 36:31.522
because it smelled somethin' on her.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.649
And all I did was stand there.

36:34.942 --> 36:37.278
I couldn't move.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.989
I couldn't think of anything to say.
I just--

36:42.867 --> 36:44.410
I was so afraid.

36:48.205 --> 36:50.541
You think I can still handle things but

36:51.375 --> 36:52.919
I'm not who I was.

36:54.128 --> 36:55.254
I'm weak.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.298
Lately, there are these moments

36:57.298 --> 36:59.717
where the fear comes up outta nowhere and

37:00.509 --> 37:01.636
my heart

37:02.386 --> 37:04.305
feels like it's stopped.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.603
And I have dreams.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.440
Every night.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.609
What kinda dreams?

37:17.109 --> 37:20.446
I don't know. I can't remember.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.449
I just know that when I wake up

37:26.827 --> 37:28.746
I've lost somethin'.

37:29.830 --> 37:31.832
I'm failin' in my sleep.

37:33.250 --> 37:34.794
That's all I do.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.380
It's all I've ever done

37:37.380 --> 37:38.714
is fail her

37:39.423 --> 37:40.967
again and again.

37:42.551 --> 37:43.719
You want me to take her.

37:43.719 --> 37:45.972
I'm just gonna get her killed.

37:45.972 --> 37:47.181
I know it.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.767
I have to leave her.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.311
Joel.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.356
It's why you took off on me, right?

37:55.356 --> 37:57.566
To make up for the things we did?

37:59.819 --> 38:03.698
Well, here's your chance
to bring your kid into a better world.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.449
You're younger than me.
You're still strong.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.660
You said it yourself, you'll come back.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.286
You have to take her.

38:15.876 --> 38:18.295
And you can't tell anyone, not even Maria.

38:20.381 --> 38:21.757
Tommy, you're the only one I trust.

38:21.757 --> 38:25.511
If anyone else sees those bites on her,
what's under her skin,

38:25.511 --> 38:27.138
they'll shoot her.

38:29.557 --> 38:32.018
It's the last thing I'll ever ask of you.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.396
I swear.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.370
I'll take her out at dawn.

39:05.926 --> 39:09.847
We got you in 38.
It's left, left, right.

39:22.985 --> 39:25.362
<i>I have a feeling
you'd rather be alone, Luce.</i>

39:25.362 --> 39:28.240
<i>He'll know we thought it was lousy
if we don't say hello.</i>

39:28.240 --> 39:30.201
<i>All right.
But try and be tactful.</i>

39:30.201 --> 39:32.369
- <i>What's tactful?</i>
- <i>Lie.</i>

39:35.289 --> 39:36.707
<i>Hello?</i>

39:36.707 --> 39:39.710
<i>Mr. Garfield? It's Lucy and me.</i>

39:41.796 --> 39:45.049
<i>We just came back to tell you
how much we enjoyed it.</i>

39:45.049 --> 39:46.675
<i>I had the best time.</i>

39:46.675 --> 39:48.511
<i>At first,
I thought it was gonna be boring.</i>

40:07.988 --> 40:08.906
Ellie?

40:18.916 --> 40:21.043
Is this really
all they had to worry about?

40:22.169 --> 40:24.130
Boys. Movies.

40:24.964 --> 40:27.508
Deciding which shirt
goes with which skirt.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.177
It's bizarre.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.933
- Listen,
- Why are you here?

40:37.351 --> 40:40.146
- I came here to talk to you.
- No, why are you still here?

40:40.146 --> 40:42.064
If you're gonna ditch me, ditch me.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.360
What exactly did you hear?

40:48.404 --> 40:50.948
"I have to leave her.
You have to take her."

40:54.910 --> 40:57.454
You know, I stood up for you
today because I thought--

41:02.585 --> 41:05.546
I made this decision for your own good.

41:05.546 --> 41:07.548
You'll be way better off with Tommy.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.050
He knows the area better than I do--

41:10.050 --> 41:12.261
- Do you give a shit about me or not?
- Of course, I do.

41:12.261 --> 41:14.471
Then what are you so afraid of?

41:18.726 --> 41:20.394
I'm not her, you know?

41:23.147 --> 41:25.691
- Maria told me about Sarah and--
- Don't.

41:30.112 --> 41:31.655
Don't say another word.

41:34.909 --> 41:37.119
I'm sorry about your daughter, Joel.

41:38.537 --> 41:40.080
But I have lost people, too.

41:41.123 --> 41:43.250
You have no idea what loss is.

41:45.127 --> 41:47.296
Everybody I have cared for

41:47.296 --> 41:49.924
has either died or left me.

41:50.466 --> 41:53.135
Everybody, fucking except for you!

41:53.135 --> 41:55.471
So don't tell me that I'd be safer
with somebody else

41:55.471 --> 41:58.641
because the truth is
I would just be more scared.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.316
You're right.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.319
You're not my daughter.

42:11.111 --> 42:13.280
And I sure as hell ain't your dad.

42:15.366 --> 42:16.909
Now, come dawn

42:18.035 --> 42:20.162
we're goin' our separate ways.

43:54.631 --> 43:55.716
Come in.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.030
Stables.

44:42.846 --> 44:44.306
You came here to say goodbye or something?

44:44.306 --> 44:45.182
No.

44:46.141 --> 44:48.060
I came here to steal
one of these horses and go.

44:48.894 --> 44:49.937
I woulda gave you one.

44:50.479 --> 44:51.522
I know.

44:52.272 --> 44:53.232
Anyway

44:53.982 --> 44:56.068
that was 30 minutes ago, and I guess

44:59.613 --> 45:00.823
you deserve a choice.

45:00.823 --> 45:02.324
I still think you'd be better off
with Tommy--

45:02.324 --> 45:03.575
Let's go.

45:04.451 --> 45:05.369
Okay.

45:25.848 --> 45:26.932
Hold onto both.

45:30.394 --> 45:31.770
General direction?

45:31.770 --> 45:34.690
Head southeast till you hit I-25.

45:34.690 --> 45:37.276
It's right off the interstate.
Shouldn't be hard to miss.

45:53.417 --> 45:56.128
There's a place for you here.
Both of you.

45:57.087 --> 45:58.630
Countin' on it.

46:03.218 --> 46:04.261
Can I borrow that?

46:05.596 --> 46:06.513
Yeah.

46:06.513 --> 46:08.265
'Cause Maria took mine, you know?

46:08.265 --> 46:10.267
I already said yes, Joel.

46:17.441 --> 46:19.276
<i>Adios,</i> big brother.

46:34.583 --> 46:35.918
Close it up.

47:00.359 --> 47:01.276
Wide right.

47:01.276 --> 47:03.403
- You're flinchin'.
- The target's too small.

47:03.403 --> 47:05.447
I made it bigger than I should've.
Eject the cartridge.

47:07.199 --> 47:08.909
And I am not flinching.

47:09.535 --> 47:11.954
- The rifle just sucks.
- Okay, give it.

47:13.413 --> 47:14.748
It doesn't aim right.

47:14.748 --> 47:15.791
You'll see.

47:17.376 --> 47:19.044
A deep breath in, slow breath out.

47:19.044 --> 47:21.046
You squeeze the trigger like you love it.

47:21.797 --> 47:22.965
Gentle,

47:22.965 --> 47:25.384
steady, nice and slow.

47:25.384 --> 47:26.760
You gonna shoot this thing
or get it pregnant?

47:28.929 --> 47:31.223
It isn't gonna work. It doesn't aim right.

47:33.475 --> 47:35.811
You dick.

47:59.418 --> 48:02.296
So the way they ran stuff in Jackson,
was how things used to be?

48:02.296 --> 48:03.672
No.

48:03.672 --> 48:06.008
The country was too big for that.

48:06.633 --> 48:09.052
Back then, there were basically
two main ways of lookin' at things.

48:09.052 --> 48:11.597
Some people wanted to own everything.

48:12.264 --> 48:15.017
And some people didn't want anyone
to own anything at all.

48:16.184 --> 48:17.644
Which one were you?

48:17.644 --> 48:19.646
Neither. I just did my job.

48:20.272 --> 48:22.357
Which was building?

48:22.357 --> 48:23.942
That's right.

48:23.942 --> 48:26.486
Houses, stores, that kinda thing.

48:26.486 --> 48:28.488
We were called "contractors."

48:30.240 --> 48:32.367
"The Contractor."

48:33.243 --> 48:34.786
That's pretty cool.

48:35.329 --> 48:37.456
Yeah. We were cool.

48:38.290 --> 48:39.916
Everybody loved contractors.

48:40.626 --> 48:41.543
Nice.

48:53.805 --> 48:55.974
Okay, so if you mess up your fourth down,

48:55.974 --> 48:57.434
then you give the ball to the other team?

48:58.018 --> 48:59.770
Right.
It's called a "turnover."

48:59.770 --> 49:00.979
Turnover.

49:01.730 --> 49:04.399
But if you make it to 10 yards,

49:04.399 --> 49:06.360
then you're back to first down?

49:06.360 --> 49:07.361
Yep.

49:08.070 --> 49:12.282
So, basically just moving
in one direction.

49:12.282 --> 49:13.492
Basically.

49:14.284 --> 49:17.829
- But violent.
- Oh. Well. There's that.

49:19.122 --> 49:22.084
Well, how 'bout that?
Made it in five days.

49:22.084 --> 49:25.712
Easy days. I don't know what
Tommy was so afraid of.

49:25.712 --> 49:27.673
Still time to find out.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.383
"Still time to find out."

49:30.092 --> 49:33.428
"The Contractorrrr."

49:46.066 --> 49:49.444
Home of the Big Horns.
What does that mean?

49:49.444 --> 49:50.779
Team mascot.

49:51.697 --> 49:52.948
It's a kind of sheep.

49:52.948 --> 49:54.157
See?

49:54.157 --> 49:56.159
One step closer to your dream.

49:56.827 --> 49:58.120
Don't see any Fireflies, though.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.122
They're probably in the middle.

50:00.122 --> 50:01.790
Safer.

50:04.042 --> 50:05.377
This way.

50:14.803 --> 50:16.304
So these places

50:17.097 --> 50:18.807
people would live here and, like, what?

50:18.807 --> 50:20.851
- Go to classes and stuff?
- Yup.

50:20.851 --> 50:24.104
- Even though they were adults.
- Sort of adults.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.690
I think it was just as much about partying

50:26.690 --> 50:28.942
and findin' themselves as anythin' else.

50:28.942 --> 50:31.319
Figuring out what they wanted to do
with their lives.

50:31.319 --> 50:33.864
What they wanted to do with their lives.

50:35.866 --> 50:37.409
So I've been thinkin'.

50:38.452 --> 50:39.786
I don't want a sheep ranch, actually.

50:39.786 --> 50:41.163
I mean, if the deal is I can do anything?

50:41.163 --> 50:42.748
That's the deal.

50:42.748 --> 50:44.166
Well

50:44.166 --> 50:46.042
when I was a kid,
I wanted to be a singer.

50:46.042 --> 50:47.335
Shut up.

50:48.462 --> 50:50.005
Why is that funny?

50:50.922 --> 50:53.091
- You gotta sing something now.
- No.

50:53.091 --> 50:55.385
- Come on, man. I'm not gonna laugh.
- You're already laughin'.

50:55.385 --> 50:56.803
Yeah, okay, true.

50:57.596 --> 50:59.765
Well, you're singin' for me later.

50:59.765 --> 51:01.224
I'm gonna save the fuckin' world, man.

51:01.224 --> 51:03.226
It's the least you can do for me.

51:05.145 --> 51:06.480
Fair enough.

51:12.652 --> 51:13.945
Are those monkeys?

51:14.488 --> 51:15.989
Must be from the old labs.

51:16.823 --> 51:18.366
Look at them go.

51:18.366 --> 51:19.993
First time seein' a monkey?

51:19.993 --> 51:21.912
First time seein' a monkey.

51:26.583 --> 51:27.751
Lookit.

51:32.964 --> 51:34.090
Here we go.

51:38.845 --> 51:41.973
- Guard stations.
- No guards.

51:44.267 --> 51:45.393
Yeah.

51:45.393 --> 51:46.394
Gun?

51:48.021 --> 51:49.064
Yeah.

52:52.752 --> 52:54.337
There were definitely doctors here.

53:04.347 --> 53:05.682
This is a packing list.

53:06.349 --> 53:08.518
Somethin' you make before moving.

53:08.518 --> 53:09.853
They just left?

53:13.273 --> 53:14.816
Maybe not all of them.

54:01.947 --> 54:04.658
Well, at least it ain't Clickers.

54:04.658 --> 54:06.660
Yeah, no Fireflies either.

54:07.494 --> 54:10.664
Maybe in all that research,
they turned into fuckin' monkeys.

54:27.889 --> 54:29.432
That's where they went?

54:29.432 --> 54:31.309
All the pins lead there.

54:31.309 --> 54:33.269
Maybe gettin' ahead of the weather,

54:33.269 --> 54:34.646
better facilities?

54:34.646 --> 54:35.939
I don't know.

54:35.939 --> 54:39.067
- This way.
- Shut the fuck up.

54:54.708 --> 54:56.042
Out the back.

55:15.895 --> 55:17.564
- Ready?
- Yeah.

55:23.319 --> 55:27.449
Come here. Come here.
Come here. I got ya.

55:29.784 --> 55:30.577
Joel!

56:06.446 --> 56:07.864
Joel! Get on the horse!

56:08.990 --> 56:10.075
Get on the horse.

56:12.243 --> 56:13.036
Joel!

56:17.457 --> 56:18.333
Get him!

56:18.333 --> 56:19.250
Go!

56:21.002 --> 56:21.836
Get back!

56:22.462 --> 56:23.254
Shit!

56:25.173 --> 56:26.341
You motherfucker!

56:34.224 --> 56:36.768
They're not following us.
I think we're safe.

56:37.602 --> 56:39.896
Joel?

56:40.563 --> 56:42.065
Joel, no, no, no! Shit!

56:42.065 --> 56:43.108
Fuck!

56:44.692 --> 56:45.735
Joel?

56:46.444 --> 56:47.487
Joel?

56:49.030 --> 56:50.365
Shit.

56:51.533 --> 56:53.118
Joel, open your eyes.

56:53.118 --> 56:55.745
Open your eyes.
Joel, you gotta get up.

56:58.373 --> 57:00.625
I can't fuckin' do this without you.

57:00.625 --> 57:03.711
I don't know where the fuck I'm going,
what the fuck I'm gonna do.

57:04.671 --> 57:05.797
Joel.

57:11.845 --> 57:12.971
Please.

57:14.931 --> 57:16.474
Joel, please.
