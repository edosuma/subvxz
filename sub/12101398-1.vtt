WEBVTT

02:26.068 --> 02:28.237
I'm pouring a glass.
Do you want some?

02:28.270 --> 02:29.404
No, I'm good!

02:42.417 --> 02:44.219
Who's there?

02:45.953 --> 02:47.189
Hello?

02:47.222 --> 02:48.257
Mom, it's me.

02:50.058 --> 02:51.059
Mom!

02:53.794 --> 02:55.397
<i>Door one.</i>

02:55.430 --> 02:57.366
Uh,
my key doesn't work.

03:00.935 --> 03:01.936
No, we, uh...

03:03.738 --> 03:05.274
We changed the locks last year

03:05.307 --> 03:07.209
after you and Eric
stole the guitars.

03:10.078 --> 03:12.747
The deal was
you wouldn't come back

03:12.780 --> 03:13.881
until you were clean.

03:13.915 --> 03:15.050
Wait, wait, wait.

03:15.083 --> 03:17.286
That is why
I'm here. I am...

03:18.120 --> 03:19.121
I'm done.

03:19.621 --> 03:21.356
I wanna come home.

03:21.390 --> 03:23.192
Are you done?
Are you out of drugs?

03:24.259 --> 03:26.195
I ended it with Eric.

03:26.228 --> 03:28.330
He's gone. I've been living
on my own on the streets

03:28.363 --> 03:32.334
for maybe like a week
or maybe even more.

03:32.367 --> 03:34.403
You know, I've been thinking
about all the things

03:34.436 --> 03:36.804
that you said to me
since I was like a little girl

03:36.837 --> 03:38.806
and I've had these,
like, realizations like,

03:38.839 --> 03:43.245
these big, big realizations
that I wanna go back to school

03:43.278 --> 03:44.313
and I wanna get a job

03:44.346 --> 03:47.182
and I just wanna
get my kids back...

03:47.216 --> 03:49.017
Molly, stop. Just stop.

03:49.051 --> 03:50.885
I've heard this speech
for 10 years.

03:50.918 --> 03:53.088
Mom,
I need to be home.

03:53.121 --> 03:55.856
You know, I do not do well
when I'm left on my own

03:56.458 --> 03:58.060
and I wanna detox

04:00.429 --> 04:02.830
and I can do that here.

04:02.863 --> 04:05.833
No. Come back when you're clean.

04:05.866 --> 04:06.867
No, Mom, please.

04:08.136 --> 04:11.240
I'll see you when you're clean.

04:11.273 --> 04:13.941
Mom! Please! Mom!

04:13.975 --> 04:16.144
It's me!

04:16.178 --> 04:17.479
Come here, come here.

04:17.979 --> 04:19.314
Oh!

04:19.348 --> 04:20.848
You're doing the right thing.

04:20.881 --> 04:22.850
If you let her in,
she's gonna blow up your life.

04:22.883 --> 04:25.087
Oh, you know,
don't talk about her like that.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.288
She's not a bomb.

04:26.321 --> 04:28.290
I'm just saying
this is what you have to do.

04:28.323 --> 04:30.359
She won't walk if you carry her.

04:30.392 --> 04:31.759
Oh, fuck off.

04:34.129 --> 04:35.130
Okay.

04:56.917 --> 04:58.986
Don't make me call the police.

04:59.021 --> 05:00.855
Oh, my God. Who are you?

05:00.888 --> 05:03.458
Every time you come into this
house, something disappears.

05:03.492 --> 05:05.027
I'll stay at a hotel.

05:05.060 --> 05:08.263
I just need some place safe
that I can get clean.

05:08.297 --> 05:09.997
Just money for a hotel then.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.169
You want me to give you money?

05:15.037 --> 05:16.138
Are you crazy?

05:16.171 --> 05:19.408
Like the money you needed
for shoes or for glasses?

05:19.441 --> 05:23.278
Or for, uh, oh,
online cosmetology classes?

05:23.312 --> 05:26.081
Or Zumba lessons
to get back in shape?

05:27.649 --> 05:30.085
How much heroin have I paid for?

05:30.118 --> 05:31.919
You're right.

05:31.952 --> 05:34.623
I'll just detox under a highway

05:34.656 --> 05:36.091
with prostitutes and rats,

05:36.124 --> 05:37.626
'cause that's
a much better plan, Mom.

05:37.659 --> 05:39.161
Why are you covering your mouth?

05:41.962 --> 05:43.031
Let me see.

05:44.199 --> 05:45.200
Show me.

05:49.237 --> 05:50.238
Oh, my God.

05:59.014 --> 06:01.383
Can I please just
have a pillow and a blanket?

06:01.416 --> 06:03.151
It gets really cold at night.

06:03.984 --> 06:04.985
Get well, Molly.

06:19.301 --> 06:20.302
I set the alarm.

06:27.175 --> 06:31.313
Why did you say before
that she blows up my life?

06:31.346 --> 06:33.914
I mean what you
really meant was our life?

06:33.948 --> 06:35.983
- Yes.
- So why didn't you just say that...

06:36.017 --> 06:37.386
Do I need to?

06:37.419 --> 06:39.554
I'm tired of what
we've been through.

06:39.588 --> 06:41.523
I'm scared for you
whenever she's around.

06:41.556 --> 06:44.959
Just don't let her suck you in.

06:44.992 --> 06:46.395
She doesn't suck me in.

06:48.563 --> 06:52.134
Whenever I've decided
to reengage with her,

06:52.167 --> 06:55.036
I've always done it
with my eyes wide open.

07:36.578 --> 07:38.447
<i>Door one.</i>

07:38.480 --> 07:41.383
If you're hoping for pity,
there's none coming.

07:41.416 --> 07:43.718
- Go to a shelter.
- I need to be home.

07:45.187 --> 07:46.688
Go, please.

08:48.383 --> 08:50.752
Oh,
God damn it, you are stubborn.

08:51.653 --> 08:52.721
You're like a mule.

08:53.421 --> 08:55.423
If there's anyone or anything

08:55.457 --> 08:58.693
more fucking relentless
than heroin, it's you.

08:58.727 --> 09:01.263
That's my one glimmer
of hope in all this here.

09:04.499 --> 09:06.434
If you're serious,

09:06.468 --> 09:09.170
I'll drive you
to detox right now.

09:09.204 --> 09:13.642
Okay, but first can I stay
here a couple of days.

09:13.675 --> 09:16.478
- No.
- Getting into detox is not that simple...

09:16.511 --> 09:18.647
Molly, we can definitely try.

09:18.680 --> 09:19.881
Beds open up every day.

09:19.915 --> 09:21.650
- They do not open up everyday.
- Either we leave right now,

09:21.683 --> 09:23.718
or you can get used
to sleeping on the porch.

09:23.752 --> 09:27.556
Fuck! Were you always
this heartless bitch? Huh?

09:29.891 --> 09:31.793
I guess I must have forgotten.

09:31.826 --> 09:35.096
Can I at least
come inside and shower?

09:35.130 --> 09:37.132
I haven't showered in weeks.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.702
I'm...
I'm on my period.

09:43.204 --> 09:46.408
No. I'll go get my things.

09:48.276 --> 09:49.377
Molly, wait here.

09:49.411 --> 09:51.546
- I'll go with you.
- Wait here.

10:25.313 --> 10:26.314
Seat belt.

10:36.891 --> 10:39.327
We'll pick up tampons
on the way. Okay?

10:40.662 --> 10:42.797
No. I don't need any.

10:42.831 --> 10:43.832
You're not on...

10:47.402 --> 10:48.403
Okay.

11:02.250 --> 11:04.185
- Hello.
- Hello.

11:04.819 --> 11:06.221
- Name?
- Molly...

11:06.254 --> 11:08.356
Molly Wheeler Margaret.

11:09.457 --> 11:10.859
Do you have your Medicaid card?

11:10.892 --> 11:11.893
Yeah.

11:15.397 --> 11:16.665
What drugs are you using?

11:16.698 --> 11:20.702
Heroin, methadone
and some crack.

11:20.735 --> 11:24.572
Uh, if I get any,
then maybe Adderall.

11:24.606 --> 11:26.408
Last time you used?

11:26.441 --> 11:29.611
Yesterday morning
so I'm hurting.

11:30.712 --> 11:32.247
How long have you been addicted?

11:32.981 --> 11:34.849
- Hmm.
- Ten years or more.

11:36.584 --> 11:38.219
Have you ever
been through detox?

11:38.253 --> 11:39.788
- Uh-huh.
- How many times?

11:40.422 --> 11:41.423
Um...

11:42.290 --> 11:43.625
Fourteen.

11:43.658 --> 11:46.327
- Excuse me?
- Fourteen times.

11:50.565 --> 11:52.634
Okay, so you know the drill.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.269
Medicaid pays for three nights.

11:54.302 --> 11:55.770
- After that, you're on your own.
- Mm-hmm.

11:55.804 --> 11:59.374
You get a cot, two towels, three
meals a day, if you can tolerate them.

11:59.407 --> 12:00.942
Muscle spasms, cold sweats,

12:00.975 --> 12:03.978
fever, vomiting, paranoia, insomnia.
All that's normal.

12:04.013 --> 12:07.782
But if you start to have trouble
breathing, speak up.

12:07.816 --> 12:10.385
The only open bed
is in a shared woman's room.

12:12.287 --> 12:13.288
Sign here.

12:28.303 --> 12:29.304
Okay.

12:29.637 --> 12:30.839
Let's go.

12:30.872 --> 12:34.809
Okay. You've made your point.
Can I please come home now?

12:34.843 --> 12:38.013
No. I'll pick you up
in three days.

12:38.047 --> 12:40.415
Really?
You're not gonna help?

12:41.083 --> 12:43.351
You're gonna walk away?

12:43.384 --> 12:44.552
It's your thing, huh?

12:45.020 --> 12:46.588
Fucking walk away!

12:50.992 --> 12:51.993
Come on.

13:07.909 --> 13:12.747
Oh, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

13:24.859 --> 13:26.628
You motherfucker.

14:00.728 --> 14:02.097
She's in hell right now.

14:05.834 --> 14:06.835
What?

14:08.037 --> 14:10.105
She's in pain from head to toe

14:11.739 --> 14:13.374
and I kicked her to the curb.

14:14.776 --> 14:18.580
You should call
your mothers' group.

14:19.248 --> 14:20.915
Don't want their goddamn pity.

14:22.450 --> 14:23.985
It helps, you know. It helps.

14:25.553 --> 14:27.956
- You're all in the same boat.
- Yeah.

14:28.656 --> 14:30.092
Sinking 24/7.

14:34.796 --> 14:36.497
Sometimes I get
the feeling that...

14:39.701 --> 14:41.103
I don't want
to love her anymore.

14:42.837 --> 14:44.006
Scares the shit out of me.

14:46.574 --> 14:47.909
I'm gonna keep
loving her, right?

14:48.943 --> 14:50.012
Of course.

14:52.547 --> 14:53.548
Oh.

14:56.484 --> 14:58.087
This is the mess
you married into.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.421
I'm okay with it.

15:00.455 --> 15:02.091
Yeah, then you
really are an idiot.

15:05.227 --> 15:06.828
You always talk to me like that

15:06.861 --> 15:08.863
whenever she's around.
Have you noticed that?

15:11.233 --> 15:12.433
Stop doing it.

15:13.935 --> 15:14.936
Okay?

15:16.571 --> 15:17.839
I'm sorry, honey.

15:28.683 --> 15:31.387
Oh, that feels so good.

15:32.620 --> 15:33.721
You're the best, Deb.

15:36.191 --> 15:38.726
Oh, did I tell you we just
got back from a trip to Napa?

15:39.161 --> 15:40.595
Oh, really?

15:40.628 --> 15:43.464
- How was it?
- It was incredible.

15:43.498 --> 15:45.934
Walter's client
let us say in his house.

15:45.967 --> 15:48.636
House was
not really a word for it.

15:48.670 --> 15:49.704
It's ridiculous.

16:05.054 --> 16:05.954
I'm gonna level
with you, Molly,

16:05.987 --> 16:07.889
because you don't
have time for more bull.

16:09.757 --> 16:12.161
You have gone
through this 15 times.

16:12.194 --> 16:15.230
Statistically, you are
likely to be back again.

16:15.264 --> 16:18.533
Heroin has a 97 percent
relapse rate.

16:18.566 --> 16:21.602
You've already blown through the
veins in your arms, your ankles,

16:22.304 --> 16:24.539
hands, feet.

16:24.572 --> 16:26.641
Yeah, you stayed away
from your neck so far,

16:26.674 --> 16:29.144
but most people
go there sooner or later.

16:29.178 --> 16:31.180
You have put yourself
in quite a situation.

16:31.213 --> 16:34.816
- No, actually, you all put her in this situation.
- Oh, my God, Mom. Please.

16:34.849 --> 16:37.186
Her problem started in a
doctor's office just like this.

16:37.219 --> 16:38.920
When she was 17,

16:38.953 --> 16:41.223
she sprained
her knee water skiing

16:41.256 --> 16:44.859
and walked out
with a prescription for 75 Oxy

16:44.892 --> 16:47.262
and never a refill denied.

16:47.296 --> 16:49.231
Now that's, that's terrible.

16:49.264 --> 16:51.266
- I'm sorry.
- You and me both.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.036
What are your triggers?

16:55.570 --> 17:00.975
Boredom, anxiety,
shame, loneliness.

17:01.010 --> 17:03.811
My life.
Basically my life's a trigger.

17:05.080 --> 17:06.081
You're not alone.

17:06.814 --> 17:07.982
I'm 31 years old,

17:08.017 --> 17:10.252
and I've done nothing
but go down in life.

17:10.285 --> 17:12.587
So I can sit around
and feel all of that,

17:12.620 --> 17:15.124
or I can do something
about it and feel good

17:15.990 --> 17:17.026
and numb.

17:18.693 --> 17:22.864
She's always been really
sensitive to things like that.

17:22.897 --> 17:24.299
To feelings.

17:24.333 --> 17:26.901
It's always what she said
since she was a teenager.

17:26.934 --> 17:28.636
How would you know?
You weren't even there...

17:28.669 --> 17:30.905
Molly, I'm here now.

17:30.938 --> 17:34.309
Let's talk about
our options. Hmm?

17:34.343 --> 17:37.079
Do either of you know
what an opioid antagonist is?

17:37.678 --> 17:38.746
No.

17:38.780 --> 17:40.315
It's a shot we give you
once a month,

17:40.349 --> 17:43.252
and it blocks opioids
from getting into your system.

17:43.285 --> 17:46.255
Heroin, Oxy, narco.

17:46.288 --> 17:49.590
The shot essentially makes you
immune to getting high.

17:49.624 --> 17:51.093
Now it's not a magic bullet.

17:51.126 --> 17:53.228
You still have to do
the active work of recovery.

17:53.262 --> 17:54.829
Twelve-steps therapy, all of it.

17:57.266 --> 17:58.267
Is it safe?

17:59.901 --> 18:01.170
Are you fucking kidding me?

18:02.737 --> 18:04.206
You've spent 10 years

18:04.239 --> 18:07.775
shooting up heroin
laced with what,

18:07.809 --> 18:10.978
rat poison and baby powder
and God knows what else.

18:11.013 --> 18:13.748
And now all of a sudden,
your body's a temple.

18:13.781 --> 18:16.684
Is it fucking safe? Oh, God.

18:17.652 --> 18:18.920
Jesus, Molly.

18:18.953 --> 18:20.322
Yes, it's safe.

18:20.355 --> 18:21.356
FDA approved.

18:22.723 --> 18:24.959
You have to be clean
for at least a week.

18:24.992 --> 18:26.328
Now if you still
have drugs in your system

18:26.361 --> 18:27.396
when you get this shot,

18:27.429 --> 18:29.797
it puts you into something
called rapid withdrawal.

18:29.831 --> 18:30.965
That's very dangerous.

18:31.533 --> 18:32.767
Emergency room stuff.

18:34.236 --> 18:36.038
And then a shot once a month.

18:41.210 --> 18:42.211
It's a chance.

18:43.345 --> 18:44.779
Take it, Moll.

18:44.812 --> 18:46.315
It's my call, Mom.

18:53.388 --> 18:55.190
Fine. Yeah, okay.

18:55.224 --> 18:56.757
I think
that's a good choice.

18:57.692 --> 19:00.728
You have been in detox
four days already.

19:00.761 --> 19:03.031
You should do
four more to be safe.

19:03.065 --> 19:05.067
So let's shoot
for 9:00 a.m., Friday.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.701
Wait. Four more days? Seriously?

19:06.734 --> 19:09.104
She can't wait that long.
She might be using in an hour.

19:09.138 --> 19:11.006
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Can't she stay here?

19:11.039 --> 19:14.243
- No.
- No. Unfortunately, we need the bed.

19:14.276 --> 19:16.278
You need to be
somewhere not alone

19:16.311 --> 19:17.745
and away from other users.

19:25.987 --> 19:26.988
Four more days.

19:29.358 --> 19:31.093
I can do that. All right?

19:31.126 --> 19:32.194
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:33.162 --> 19:34.829
- Yeah, you can.
- Yeah.

19:37.832 --> 19:39.234
That guy should be shot.

19:45.073 --> 19:47.209
- Okay.
- Yeah. So sorry.

19:47.242 --> 19:49.344
Your gums are very inflamed.

19:49.378 --> 19:51.446
I'm gonna give you
some ointment to take home.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.383
- Non-narcotic, but use it sparingly anyway.
- Hmm.

19:55.816 --> 19:58.320
Now, these are temps.

19:58.353 --> 20:00.155
Let's try them for size.

20:00.189 --> 20:02.157
Uh, okay.

20:02.191 --> 20:03.925
Ow!

20:03.958 --> 20:05.927
I'll give you call
in a couple of weeks

20:05.960 --> 20:07.196
when the real ones come in.

20:08.096 --> 20:09.097
They hurt.

20:10.032 --> 20:12.167
Yes, they'll take
some getting used to.

20:12.900 --> 20:13.901
Let me see.

20:21.543 --> 20:23.878
<i>Door one.</i>

20:28.150 --> 20:30.018
Get in here.

20:30.052 --> 20:33.322
You sure? I don't wanna impose.

20:33.355 --> 20:34.889
If now's a bad time,

20:34.922 --> 20:36.958
- I can always come back later.
- Oh, screw you.

21:16.265 --> 21:18.367
Molly's amazing salon.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.069
Remember the time I accidentally
dyed your hair pink?

21:21.103 --> 21:23.472
Accidentally? Sure.

21:23.505 --> 21:26.508
Why do you keep all this crap?
It's like a museum.

21:26.541 --> 21:29.344
Oh, you know,
a lot of good memories.

21:29.378 --> 21:31.146
Yeah, from before
I was a fuck up.

21:33.248 --> 21:34.383
Remember what this is?

21:35.417 --> 21:36.451
Argh!

21:36.485 --> 21:38.120
Smallest
violin in the world.

21:39.454 --> 21:42.923
Where the fuck are my perfumes?
My... My jewelry.

21:42.957 --> 21:47.496
You sold the perfume
and you pawned all the jewelry

21:49.031 --> 21:53.468
along with my wedding ring,
my engagement ring,

21:55.637 --> 21:56.904
your grandmother's.

22:10.218 --> 22:11.219
Jesus.

22:13.021 --> 22:14.189
Did you shoot up in here?

22:15.457 --> 22:18.226
I don't know.
I guess I must have after rehab.

22:18.260 --> 22:21.263
Oh! That's reassuring.

22:23.031 --> 22:24.832
Oh, what the fuck?

22:27.602 --> 22:28.603
Oh!

22:34.242 --> 22:36.877
So, um, I'm supposed
to work tonight.

22:37.679 --> 22:40.215
The casino's booked solid,

22:40.248 --> 22:42.883
but I'll have my phone on me,

22:42.917 --> 22:45.420
and it'll only be
a couple of hours.

22:47.656 --> 22:48.856
Chris will be here.

22:49.257 --> 22:50.625
He's out back.

22:50.659 --> 22:52.594
But if you
need anything, call me...

22:52.627 --> 22:54.429
Did you tell him
that I was staying here?

22:55.163 --> 22:56.398
Of course, I did.

22:56.431 --> 22:58.100
I called him.

22:59.334 --> 23:00.335
He's...

23:02.104 --> 23:03.105
He's fine with it.

23:13.981 --> 23:15.150
I'm happy you're home.

23:47.416 --> 23:48.683
I'm gonna go have a cigarette.

23:50.719 --> 23:52.721
Jesus. What is that sound?

23:52.754 --> 23:54.022
It's the alarm.

23:54.055 --> 23:57.259
What? Can you turn it off?

23:57.292 --> 23:59.428
I need it to beep
every time the door opens.

23:59.461 --> 24:01.962
Why? This is like the safest
neighborhood in the world.

24:28.356 --> 24:30.125
This puzzle been here
this whole time?

24:30.158 --> 24:32.160
Oh. Yeah.
I didn't want to touch it.

24:32.194 --> 24:34.196
I thought maybe you'd like
to finish it someday.

24:34.229 --> 24:35.230
No, I hate it.

24:36.731 --> 24:39.267
This is a pay as you go.

24:39.301 --> 24:41.503
So, uh, let me know
if you run out of minutes.

24:42.771 --> 24:45.273
Ran out of minutes?
Who am I gonna call?

24:45.307 --> 24:48.143
I entered my number.

24:48.176 --> 24:51.446
Your sister's, the kids',
the clinic and your dad's.

24:53.348 --> 24:54.716
When was the last
time I was here?

24:55.817 --> 25:01.723
Um, well, I guess it was
about a year and a half ago.

25:01.756 --> 25:04.292
I woke up the next morning
and you were gone.

25:09.664 --> 25:11.099
Can you open the garage door?

25:26.348 --> 25:27.549
Hi.

25:29.117 --> 25:30.118
Is that her?

25:31.653 --> 25:32.721
Close it.

25:42.264 --> 25:43.398
Are you gonna be all right?

25:43.431 --> 25:44.699
Mmm-hmm.

25:45.433 --> 25:47.469
Okay, I'm leaving.

25:57.312 --> 25:59.481
What?

26:01.550 --> 26:03.552
Sorry.

26:03.585 --> 26:05.353
Let me know if you need
anything, huh?

26:05.387 --> 26:07.122
Yeah.
Thank you.

26:07.889 --> 26:09.090
Okay.

26:42.490 --> 26:43.658
<i>Door one.</i>

27:20.362 --> 27:21.630
It's me.

27:23.365 --> 27:24.366
I...

27:24.833 --> 27:26.635
I'm freezing.

27:26.668 --> 27:28.403
I thought withdrawals
were supposed to be over.

27:34.943 --> 27:36.778
No. Stay. Stay.

27:36.811 --> 27:38.413
Oh, Molly.

27:38.446 --> 27:39.814
I'm tired.

27:41.249 --> 27:43.318
Did I really sell
your wedding rings?

27:48.256 --> 27:49.591
You know, just...

27:49.624 --> 27:51.559
just don't worry about it.

27:51.593 --> 27:53.228
- Oh.
- This is a disease.

27:53.261 --> 27:54.295
This isn't you.

27:54.796 --> 27:56.431
- It's not.
- No.

27:56.464 --> 27:58.333
No, it's another you.

27:58.366 --> 27:59.768
It's not the real you.

28:00.168 --> 28:02.337
She isn't you.

28:03.005 --> 28:05.407
Ah, mind bending, Mom.

28:06.808 --> 28:07.909
Do you remember...

28:08.977 --> 28:10.845
right after I left your dad,

28:11.913 --> 28:13.715
I opened that...

28:13.748 --> 28:16.418
...that
pottery painting store

28:16.451 --> 28:18.286
way out of the mall.

28:18.319 --> 28:19.921
Oh, God, that was
such a bad idea.

28:19.954 --> 28:21.790
It was a terrible location,

28:22.691 --> 28:26.261
but I was so tired of...

28:26.294 --> 28:29.264
trying to get out
from under your dad,

28:29.297 --> 28:31.299
finding something of my own.

28:32.534 --> 28:36.905
You know that place
was so quiet,

28:36.938 --> 28:38.573
just like a mausoleum.

28:40.709 --> 28:42.577
All those empty chairs.

28:43.945 --> 28:46.715
And even after all,
I put you through,

28:48.283 --> 28:49.451
leaving you,

28:51.953 --> 28:54.656
you started coming all the way
out there after school,

28:56.658 --> 28:59.861
dragging your friends
with you.

28:59.894 --> 29:03.298
You even hosted a birthday
party there for God's sake.

29:04.566 --> 29:05.467
And after
a couple of months,

29:05.500 --> 29:09.804
you had so many of those
damn coffee mugs.

29:13.808 --> 29:15.243
That was pretty great.

29:16.745 --> 29:18.680
That was you.

29:25.453 --> 29:27.589
Almost one day down,

29:28.790 --> 29:29.924
three more to go.

29:31.893 --> 29:33.795
Does Dad know that I'm home?

29:38.399 --> 29:39.567
I'll tell him.

29:43.905 --> 29:45.607
Good night, kiddo.

30:06.361 --> 30:07.462
It's 10:00 am.

30:08.797 --> 30:09.831
They're not here.

30:11.033 --> 30:13.334
It's, uh, 10:03.

30:13.868 --> 30:15.303
Oh, relax.

30:16.638 --> 30:17.839
I bet they don't come.
Why?

30:17.872 --> 30:19.874
- Why would they come?
- Oh, stop that.

30:22.443 --> 30:23.745
Have you heard
from your sister?

30:24.813 --> 30:27.049
No. Why?

30:27.082 --> 30:29.018
Well, she wants to see you.

30:30.919 --> 30:33.055
Since when did she have
the time to see anyone?

30:34.556 --> 30:35.723
Where are your teeth?

30:37.458 --> 30:38.760
Oh, okay.

30:38.793 --> 30:40.129
They hurt.

30:46.035 --> 30:47.669
Hi!

30:49.038 --> 30:51.006
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

30:51.040 --> 30:52.674
- Hi, Grandma!
- It's so good to see you.

30:52.707 --> 30:54.843
- Oh, hi, sweetie.
- I missed you.

30:54.876 --> 30:57.645
Oh, how are you?

30:57.679 --> 31:00.015
Ah, go hug your mom.

31:04.485 --> 31:05.753
- Hi, kiddo.
- Hi, Sean.

31:06.188 --> 31:07.522
Hi, Deb.

31:09.124 --> 31:11.093
Hey, we, uh...

31:11.126 --> 31:13.962
we can't stay long,
couple hours or so.

31:14.696 --> 31:17.398
Okay, well,
let's go inside.

31:17.765 --> 31:18.933
Come on.

31:19.901 --> 31:21.103
You want some coffee?

31:21.136 --> 31:22.670
Yeah, sure.

31:27.475 --> 31:28.610
You look good.

31:30.645 --> 31:32.047
No, but thanks.

31:38.053 --> 31:39.621
Ta-da!

31:40.189 --> 31:42.091
- All right.
- Ah...

31:42.124 --> 31:44.425
- Here, eat up.
- One.

31:44.459 --> 31:45.860
- Mmm.
- One.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.003
So how's work?

31:55.137 --> 31:57.505
It's... it's real good.

31:57.538 --> 31:59.741
There's so much of it.

31:59.774 --> 32:01.943
Thinking about opening up
a second body shop.

32:01.976 --> 32:04.445
Uh-hmm. Wait,
why are you doing that?

32:04.479 --> 32:05.713
You love nuts.

32:05.747 --> 32:09.084
I do. But the doctor says
I can't have any.

32:09.118 --> 32:11.753
Well, we found out last year
that some nuts

32:11.786 --> 32:13.688
make her tummy hurt.

32:17.092 --> 32:20.962
Um, I broke my ankle,
I was in a cast.

32:20.995 --> 32:23.698
- Oh, wow.
- It wasn't broken.

32:23.731 --> 32:24.966
- Was too.
- No.

32:24.999 --> 32:26.668
- Shut up, moron.
- Come on, guys.

32:26.701 --> 32:27.902
We talked about this.

32:29.804 --> 32:33.541
He got a hairline fracture
flying off a swing set.

32:33.574 --> 32:34.842
- Hmm.
- Knucklehead.

32:36.045 --> 32:37.478
They're good kids, though.

32:37.979 --> 32:39.547
Yeah.

32:39.580 --> 32:42.117
Yeah, I know.
I know they're good kids.

32:47.089 --> 32:48.190
How's Dad?

32:50.925 --> 32:52.560
Go for it.

32:52.593 --> 32:54.063
- He's grumpy.
- What?

32:54.096 --> 32:55.697
- You are.
- But he's okay.

32:55.730 --> 32:57.532
He helps us with homework
and stuff.

32:57.565 --> 32:59.634
- I am not grumpy.
- He farts a lot.

32:59.667 --> 33:00.902
Now that's a lie.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.204
Chill, bruh.
We like you.

33:02.237 --> 33:04.006
I'm not your "bruh," bruh.

33:04.039 --> 33:05.673
- You're a "duh."
- Duh.

33:08.543 --> 33:10.179
Oh, and he has a girlfriend.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.547
She's a chef.

33:13.781 --> 33:15.084
Her food is yummy.

33:20.888 --> 33:22.291
Get him, get him.

33:22.324 --> 33:23.858
Come on, get him!

33:23.891 --> 33:25.626
Come on! Come on!

33:25.660 --> 33:28.163
- Uh, boom! You got got.
- Oh... no.

33:30.732 --> 33:31.966
Kiddo.

33:35.803 --> 33:36.904
- Mm.
- Hold on, baby.

33:37.772 --> 33:39.141
Can I play?

33:39.174 --> 33:40.541
Sure.

33:46.914 --> 33:48.883
Phew. Ready.

33:53.988 --> 33:54.856
Come on.

33:54.889 --> 33:56.924
Come on. No, no, no,
don't press that.

33:58.926 --> 34:01.063
No, no, no, no, no.
That's cheating.

34:01.096 --> 34:03.265
You can't do that.
You can't do that.

34:03.298 --> 34:05.967
You can't do that.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.236
Come on.

34:07.269 --> 34:08.703
Come on. Come on.

34:08.736 --> 34:10.738
Oh, no, no, no.

34:10.772 --> 34:12.940
- Oh, no!
- Ha.

34:12.974 --> 34:15.943
Mom, you suck.
You totally suck.

34:16.677 --> 34:17.879
Hey.

34:17.912 --> 34:19.281
You suck. You suck.

34:19.314 --> 34:21.050
You suck. You suck!

34:21.083 --> 34:22.984
You suck! You suck.

34:23.018 --> 34:25.220
You suck! You suck!

34:25.254 --> 34:26.888
You suck.

34:31.826 --> 34:32.827
I...

34:41.403 --> 34:43.105
- You suck. You suck.
- Stop it. Stop it.

34:43.138 --> 34:45.174
You suck.
You suck. You suck.

34:45.207 --> 34:46.974
Now who sucks, huh?
Cheater?

34:47.009 --> 34:48.377
You suck. Give me the remote.

34:48.410 --> 34:50.079
- I won. No.
- Give me this.

34:50.112 --> 34:51.313
That's what you get
for sucking.

34:51.346 --> 34:53.714
- No. You stop it. Stop it.
- No. No.

34:53.748 --> 34:55.250
Mom! Mom, he's touching me.

34:58.953 --> 35:01.823
It's so beautiful
out here.

35:03.858 --> 35:05.027
Right now.

35:05.394 --> 35:07.262
Yeah.

35:07.296 --> 35:09.664
Just wish life could be
more like this.

35:10.432 --> 35:12.234
One moment...

35:12.267 --> 35:14.001
then another.

35:14.869 --> 35:16.138
Isn't it?

35:16.171 --> 35:18.107
I mean,
what's the alternative?

35:19.274 --> 35:20.342
Uh, I don't know.

35:20.375 --> 35:22.377
I'm always thinking
about the past,

35:22.411 --> 35:24.612
or worrying about the future.

35:26.081 --> 35:28.783
You know,
even before I did drugs,

35:28.816 --> 35:31.253
I remember worrying about
what was next.

35:31.286 --> 35:34.323
Like, I just couldn't live
with the uncertainty.

35:36.757 --> 35:39.027
I just want now to be now.

35:40.129 --> 35:41.829
The way it is for kids,

35:41.863 --> 35:44.699
or animals, plants.

35:46.934 --> 35:48.337
Yeah, I never
thought of that.

35:51.173 --> 35:53.875
You've always been
so smart, Moll.

35:55.776 --> 35:57.312
Yeah. And look at where
that's gotten me.

36:00.082 --> 36:01.183
<i>Hey, this is Dale.</i>

36:01.216 --> 36:03.318
<i>Leave a message or don't.</i>

36:03.352 --> 36:05.154
Hey, it's me.

36:05.187 --> 36:07.289
Um...

36:07.322 --> 36:09.757
I think you should know
that Molly is home.

36:09.790 --> 36:11.059
She's clean.

36:11.093 --> 36:13.428
As rickety as hell.

36:13.462 --> 36:15.230
And I know you don't like
talking about this stuff,

36:15.264 --> 36:17.899
but it really seems
different this time.

36:17.932 --> 36:21.003
I haven't seen her
like this since...

36:21.036 --> 36:22.737
I don't know when.

36:22.770 --> 36:24.772
She's really trying, Dale,

36:24.805 --> 36:26.475
and she keeps
asking about you.

36:26.508 --> 36:29.311
So I was wondering
if you could give her a call?

36:29.344 --> 36:31.812
Um, you know, she's...

36:31.846 --> 36:33.382
she needs support.

36:33.415 --> 36:35.816
And I think
it might really help.

36:35.850 --> 36:38.986
All right, so don't be
an asshole.

36:39.021 --> 36:40.656
Just call.

36:41.290 --> 36:42.890
Okay. Bye.

36:45.993 --> 36:47.862
How do you guys still have
so much energy?

36:47.895 --> 36:49.764
- I don't know.
- How's that possible.

36:49.797 --> 36:51.333
We had PE today.

36:51.366 --> 36:53.402
Well,
you must love running.

36:53.435 --> 36:55.437
So I know we talked
about them

36:55.470 --> 36:57.406
staying with you over
the holiday weekend.

36:58.806 --> 37:02.211
Or they can also
stay with my sister,

37:02.244 --> 37:04.079
depending on how
things were going.

37:04.112 --> 37:05.414
Oh, no, no, I'll be fine.

37:05.447 --> 37:07.115
You know,
I could totally...

37:12.187 --> 37:13.322
Yeah, I'm okay.

37:13.355 --> 37:15.057
- Let me know.
- I'll call you next week.

37:17.326 --> 37:19.927
- Bye.
- Thanks for coming.

37:19.961 --> 37:21.896
All right. Come on, guys.
Let's go, Let's go.

37:23.232 --> 37:24.799
Oh.

37:26.235 --> 37:27.735
Bye, kiddo.

37:28.437 --> 37:30.105
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

37:34.909 --> 37:36.144
Hey.

37:43.118 --> 37:46.021
When can we come back?

37:46.054 --> 37:47.055
Soon.

37:48.490 --> 37:51.026
- Can we sleep over?
- Uh...

37:51.059 --> 37:53.428
- Sure.
- Yeah, that'd be fine.

37:53.462 --> 37:55.197
- Please, Dad?
- We'll see, buddy.

38:06.575 --> 38:09.177
Ah, those kids are golden.

38:10.245 --> 38:12.047
After all, they've been through.

38:14.849 --> 38:16.051
They're wonderful.

38:16.084 --> 38:17.085
Yeah.

38:18.487 --> 38:20.088
How was it with Sean?

38:22.624 --> 38:24.159
What, not good?

38:25.460 --> 38:27.095
He hurt his back.

38:27.129 --> 38:28.863
He wants me
to get him pain killers.

38:29.598 --> 38:31.199
Are you kidding me?

38:32.100 --> 38:33.502
I should call the police
on him right now.

38:33.535 --> 38:36.471
You're not gonna do that because
the kids will end up in foster care.

38:36.505 --> 38:38.206
No, they won't.
They could stay with me.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.008
Maybe. But until
the court rules on it,

38:40.042 --> 38:41.076
they'll be in a foster home.

38:41.109 --> 38:42.843
You know this,
please just stop.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.588
That sound
is driving me crazy.

38:53.622 --> 38:55.357
How am I supposed to get better

38:55.390 --> 38:57.359
with that thing beeping
every five minutes,

38:57.392 --> 39:00.928
reminding me you suck,
you suck, you suck.

39:02.464 --> 39:04.232
Jesus, it's like
I'm in prison.

39:04.266 --> 39:06.368
I hate it as well,
but it's just our reality.

39:08.170 --> 39:10.372
You want something
from the store?

39:10.405 --> 39:11.640
Can you please
just give me 20 bucks

39:11.673 --> 39:13.141
and I'll go by myself?

39:13.175 --> 39:14.942
I feel like a toddler.

39:14.975 --> 39:16.311
Well, that's a pretty
good idea,

39:16.345 --> 39:17.379
but I think
it might be easier

39:17.412 --> 39:19.181
if I just ordered in
some heroin.

39:26.355 --> 39:27.389
Okay,

39:27.422 --> 39:29.191
cigarettes, cupcakes.

39:29.524 --> 39:30.559
Soda.

39:35.996 --> 39:36.997
What?

39:37.699 --> 39:38.933
You all right?

39:38.966 --> 39:40.035
Yeah.

39:40.068 --> 39:41.203
Your eyes look a little red.

39:42.437 --> 39:43.472
I'm tired.

39:45.674 --> 39:47.376
Jesus, what do you
want me to say?

39:47.409 --> 39:49.644
That I'm bored shitless
and craving?

39:51.213 --> 39:53.948
I'm bored shitless
and craving.

39:54.516 --> 39:56.017
Okay.

39:56.051 --> 39:57.319
Just two more days.

39:57.352 --> 39:59.054
You just have
to hang in there,

39:59.087 --> 40:00.355
two more days.

40:00.389 --> 40:01.956
No. It's... It's more than that.

40:03.492 --> 40:06.261
Sixty hours. Less.

40:06.294 --> 40:08.363
- You can do it.
- Yeah, but can you?

40:09.197 --> 40:10.632
You're so wound up,

40:10.665 --> 40:12.667
you're gonna drop dead
of a heart attack.

40:27.549 --> 40:30.419
All right, Moll,
come with me.

40:32.387 --> 40:33.388
Come on.

41:19.734 --> 41:22.337
Pick any one, it's just
food coloring and sugar.

41:24.473 --> 41:25.474
Molly.

41:26.608 --> 41:27.642
Wow.

41:28.710 --> 41:30.312
Coach Miller.

41:30.345 --> 41:32.447
- Hi.
- How are you?

41:32.481 --> 41:33.582
I'm good.

41:33.849 --> 41:35.283
Good.

41:35.317 --> 41:36.485
- Hey, Deb.
- Hey.

41:36.518 --> 41:38.119
Long time, my goodness.

41:39.354 --> 41:42.224
We've all been rooting
for you over the years.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.026
Thank you.

41:45.694 --> 41:47.362
Well, you look good.

41:47.395 --> 41:48.430
- You do.
- Yeah.

41:48.463 --> 41:49.498
Did you know that

41:49.531 --> 41:51.032
I moved over
to Lincoln last year.

41:51.066 --> 41:52.567
They got me teaching
health and wellness.

41:53.802 --> 41:55.237
Did you ever take that class?

41:55.270 --> 41:56.605
The car crash videos?

41:56.638 --> 41:57.539
Exactly.

41:57.572 --> 41:59.574
Except the videos
just put them to sleep.

41:59.608 --> 42:01.343
These kids think
they're invincible.

42:01.376 --> 42:03.278
- Hmm.
- That doesn't change, right?

42:05.614 --> 42:07.315
I'm in recovery.

42:07.349 --> 42:09.117
- Good for you.
- Hm.

42:09.150 --> 42:11.553
I wish someone like you would
come and talk to these kids.

42:11.586 --> 42:14.122
I mean, someone
who's gone through...

42:14.155 --> 42:16.258
addiction troubles
and come out the other side.

42:16.291 --> 42:17.425
You should think about it.

42:18.660 --> 42:19.761
It's just that, uh...

42:19.794 --> 42:21.830
I'm not one
for public speaking. So...

42:21.863 --> 42:24.165
We've already had two kids
overdose this year.

42:27.602 --> 42:29.704
You said Lincoln in, um...

42:29.738 --> 42:31.373
In southeast,
is that right?

42:31.406 --> 42:32.541
Yeah. Tough neighborhood.

42:33.508 --> 42:34.676
You'll make a big impact.

42:39.714 --> 42:40.715
I'll think about it.

42:40.982 --> 42:42.684
Okay.

42:42.717 --> 42:43.718
Good to see you.

42:44.586 --> 42:45.587
Great to see you.

43:03.905 --> 43:05.140
Who was that?

43:05.707 --> 43:06.875
My dealer.

43:06.908 --> 43:08.543
He said he'll be here
in 15 minutes.

43:08.577 --> 43:11.313
Ha-ha.

43:11.346 --> 43:13.748
If I wasn't a junkie,
would you even ask?

43:14.649 --> 43:15.650
Probably not.

43:17.819 --> 43:19.120
Has your dad called?

43:19.621 --> 43:20.622
No.

43:25.493 --> 43:26.661
Oh, don't go out there yet.

43:27.696 --> 43:28.763
Come on, sit with me.

43:33.435 --> 43:35.537
Oh, I forgot.

43:36.605 --> 43:37.806
I have something for you.

43:44.179 --> 43:45.213
What is it?

43:46.181 --> 43:47.248
Open it.

43:51.519 --> 43:53.822
Are you selling the house
or buying me one?

43:55.590 --> 43:57.392
Do you recognize her?

43:57.425 --> 43:59.260
- No.
- Take a closer look.

44:01.596 --> 44:03.264
Mom, I don't know
who this is.

44:03.298 --> 44:04.666
It's Colson Kirsebom.

44:05.900 --> 44:06.901
No.

44:07.535 --> 44:08.737
Mm-hmm.

44:08.770 --> 44:10.405
Oh, my God.

44:10.438 --> 44:13.808
I think it was pretty hard
for his, her parents.

44:14.776 --> 44:15.810
But you know what?

44:15.844 --> 44:17.412
I think
everything's okay now.

44:17.445 --> 44:18.580
Holy shit.

44:20.315 --> 44:22.817
The prom king is now a queen.

44:22.851 --> 44:24.786
Why is that so funny?

44:24.819 --> 44:26.554
I don't know,
but we shouldn't laugh.

44:26.588 --> 44:27.922
- Uh-huh.
- Good for her.

44:29.891 --> 44:32.260
That's one way
to reboot your life, huh?

44:32.293 --> 44:34.295
Yeah, right. Yeah.

44:34.629 --> 44:35.664
Hmph.

44:35.697 --> 44:37.499
Do you know I used to date him?

44:37.532 --> 44:39.367
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

44:39.401 --> 44:40.635
Freshman year.

44:40.669 --> 44:43.471
Right around the time you left
for, like, a couple of weeks.

44:45.440 --> 44:46.675
Oh, okay.

44:46.708 --> 44:48.276
I'm so sorry.

44:49.544 --> 44:50.745
Wish I'd been around.

44:53.448 --> 44:55.483
Yeah, you should have been.

44:57.852 --> 44:59.487
Like, it was just so sudden.

45:00.588 --> 45:02.223
You know, one day you were...

45:02.924 --> 45:04.492
putting notes
in my lunch box,

45:04.526 --> 45:05.860
and then the next,
you disappeared

45:05.894 --> 45:08.396
on your little
two-year hiatus.

45:10.598 --> 45:13.835
I thought you couldn't stand
to be around us, around me.

45:13.868 --> 45:14.903
That wasn't it.

45:14.936 --> 45:16.905
You know that's not true.

45:16.938 --> 45:17.972
Do I?

45:19.874 --> 45:21.776
Haven't we been
over this a lot?

45:30.518 --> 45:32.353
I got pregnant
with your sister.

45:33.388 --> 45:34.422
Unplanned.

45:35.924 --> 45:38.493
And in a couple of months,

45:38.526 --> 45:41.262
I found myself with a baby,

45:41.730 --> 45:43.565
and I quit my job,

45:43.598 --> 45:46.401
and I was married to a man

45:46.434 --> 45:49.304
who I really didn't know
very well,

45:49.938 --> 45:51.506
and he was...

45:52.474 --> 45:54.843
He was difficult.

45:56.344 --> 45:57.912
Me too, maybe.

45:58.947 --> 46:01.816
And when your sister
was eight,

46:01.850 --> 46:03.952
I got pregnant again
and we were,

46:03.985 --> 46:05.487
were really happy
about that.

46:05.520 --> 46:06.821
We were...

46:06.855 --> 46:08.823
I think we were at
a pretty good point.

46:08.857 --> 46:11.359
Me and your dad,
you know, for a moment.

46:12.327 --> 46:14.596
Then for 15 years,

46:14.629 --> 46:15.830
I held everything together...

46:16.765 --> 46:18.666
trying not to disappoint,

46:20.835 --> 46:23.605
swallowing your father's
fucking bullshit.

46:23.638 --> 46:26.641
His temper tantrums,
his moods.

46:29.044 --> 46:31.379
And then one night
I came home

46:31.412 --> 46:34.083
and I heard him started
to rev up one of his fits.

46:34.116 --> 46:35.850
Something about the house.

46:35.884 --> 46:37.318
I don't know...

46:38.486 --> 46:39.554
and I just...

46:45.360 --> 46:46.394
That was it.

46:48.663 --> 46:49.764
I left that night.

46:53.501 --> 46:55.904
You were the head
of the fucking PTA.

46:57.839 --> 46:59.474
You were so put together.

47:00.009 --> 47:01.609
I was pretending.

47:08.050 --> 47:10.518
I just... I am so sorry

47:10.552 --> 47:12.453
for causing you
so much pain,

47:13.855 --> 47:17.492
but I can't apologize
for trying to survive.

47:17.525 --> 47:18.560
I just can't.

47:21.429 --> 47:22.497
That would be lying.

47:28.636 --> 47:30.505
You think it's my fault

47:30.538 --> 47:31.706
that you're an addict.

47:42.483 --> 47:43.518
Mm.

47:44.019 --> 47:46.454
This is amazing.

47:49.457 --> 47:51.093
Take some deep breaths.

48:24.893 --> 48:25.927
Hm.

48:58.660 --> 48:59.861
So she's too busy to come?

49:01.163 --> 49:02.830
Oh, I'm fine, Ashley.

49:02.864 --> 49:03.898
How are you?

49:05.533 --> 49:06.567
Sorry.

49:07.202 --> 49:08.469
How are you, Mom?

49:08.503 --> 49:09.604
Oh, same old.

49:10.505 --> 49:12.807
- You?
- I'm good.

49:12.840 --> 49:14.943
Kids, work.
I'm tired all the time.

49:14.976 --> 49:16.811
But looking really good
on Instagram.

49:16.844 --> 49:18.047
My kids are a gift.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.948
I'm thriving.
I'm living my best life.

49:22.550 --> 49:23.851
Ladies.

49:23.885 --> 49:25.486
Uh, I'll just have
coffee, thanks.

49:25.520 --> 49:26.554
Uh, make that two,

49:26.587 --> 49:28.157
- and have a side of fries.
- Okay.

49:29.091 --> 49:30.259
Fries for breakfast?

49:30.292 --> 49:32.560
Why not?
That'd make me feel good.

49:33.995 --> 49:35.030
So where is she?

49:35.064 --> 49:36.631
She wanted to come,

49:36.664 --> 49:39.734
but she chickened out
at the last minute.

49:40.868 --> 49:42.637
No, she, um...

49:42.670 --> 49:44.106
she tried to build up
her self-esteem.

49:45.140 --> 49:46.607
And I'm working against that?

49:46.641 --> 49:48.077
No.

49:48.110 --> 49:49.544
It's not about you.

49:49.577 --> 49:51.046
No, it never is.

49:52.747 --> 49:55.783
Anyway,
I'm really glad that it's just us

49:55.817 --> 49:58.853
because I need a break
from all the craziness.

49:58.886 --> 50:00.722
What craziness? I thought
you said she's doing good.

50:00.755 --> 50:03.658
Well, no, she is. She is.
It's just, you know...

50:03.691 --> 50:06.028
it's a little crazy
at the house right now.

50:06.061 --> 50:08.297
She sits around
smoking, twitching,

50:08.330 --> 50:10.698
and I am there
watching her like a hawk

50:10.732 --> 50:12.834
and pretending that I'm not.

50:12.867 --> 50:15.237
You know Chris.
He's addicted to the news.

50:15.270 --> 50:17.272
He's on his iPad all the time.

50:17.306 --> 50:21.310
He can't get enough
of the world falling apart.

50:21.343 --> 50:23.711
I really don't think they should
allow men to retire.

50:25.646 --> 50:27.749
So how, how is she?

50:29.717 --> 50:31.986
Pale, thin.

50:32.887 --> 50:34.555
Toothless.

50:34.589 --> 50:38.593
But, you know, pretty damn good
under the circumstances.

50:39.761 --> 50:42.131
I was seeing glimpses
of the old Moll.

50:42.164 --> 50:43.598
Really?

50:43.965 --> 50:44.999
That's good.

50:45.034 --> 50:46.834
I don't know, Ash.

50:46.868 --> 50:49.338
I think she might
make it this time.

50:49.371 --> 50:53.175
If she can only hang on
for a couple more days.

50:53.208 --> 50:55.077
Then she could
get the shot,

50:55.110 --> 50:58.147
and one month clean
will turn into two months

51:00.848 --> 51:02.184
and two months into six.

51:05.154 --> 51:06.221
God willing.

51:08.323 --> 51:09.358
Mom.

51:09.391 --> 51:10.925
Since when do you
believe in God?

51:11.993 --> 51:13.828
Since not believing
didn't work.

51:17.132 --> 51:19.234
I know I shouldn't
get my hopes up,

51:19.268 --> 51:21.136
but...

51:21.170 --> 51:24.705
at this point,
all I have left is hope.

51:27.242 --> 51:28.776
Here we go.

51:28.810 --> 51:29.844
Thank you.

51:29.877 --> 51:31.080
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

51:41.123 --> 51:43.825
So I won my trial last week.

51:44.393 --> 51:45.561
The class action suit.

51:45.593 --> 51:48.796
- Oh, I am so sorry, Ash. I didn't even ask.
- It's fine.

51:48.830 --> 51:50.898
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

51:50.932 --> 51:53.402
I am such a self-absorbed
asshole.

51:53.435 --> 51:54.969
You're Molly-absorbed asshole.

51:55.002 --> 51:57.005
It's just that I don't
have to worry about you.

51:59.707 --> 52:00.942
No rush, whenever you're ready.

52:00.975 --> 52:02.810
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

52:06.948 --> 52:08.150
Oh, my God.

52:10.085 --> 52:12.121
I think I left
my wallet at home.

52:12.154 --> 52:15.023
- I think I can buy us a cup of coffee, Mom.
- Fuck! You're right.

52:15.057 --> 52:17.192
- I-I gotta go.
- Mom, I'm sure it's fine.

52:17.226 --> 52:18.993
It's probably under
the pillow or something.

52:19.027 --> 52:21.130
No. How could I
possibly forget it?

52:21.163 --> 52:23.798
No. Relax. You, you just said
she was doing good.

52:23.831 --> 52:24.932
Remember?

52:24.966 --> 52:26.834
Please let it go. Please.

52:26.868 --> 52:28.237
Okay.

52:42.384 --> 52:46.687
So, um, how...

52:48.190 --> 52:50.725
- How's your boyfriend?
- Oh.

52:51.460 --> 52:54.062
- Gone. Good riddance.
- Oh.

52:55.164 --> 52:56.998
He was so clingy.

52:57.032 --> 53:00.302
But I have a new boyfriend.

53:00.335 --> 53:03.438
I met him up Rachel Nixon's
engagement party.

53:03.472 --> 53:05.840
And he owns
his own plumbing company.

53:05.873 --> 53:09.810
He's funny, you know,
which is always great, right?

53:09.844 --> 53:16.318
And we're, without giving too much
away, very in sync, intimately.

53:16.351 --> 53:19.087
But there is one catch
if it's going to last

53:19.121 --> 53:21.056
because he says that we're...

53:42.843 --> 53:45.013
<i>Door One.</i>

53:45.846 --> 53:47.748
- Hey.
- Hey.

54:14.109 --> 54:16.478
<i>The blue Caribbean
and the pearl green...</i>

54:16.511 --> 54:20.082
<i>Any one of these
would be totally captivating...</i>

54:22.317 --> 54:23.985
You okay?

54:24.019 --> 54:26.021
Yeah.

54:26.054 --> 54:30.325
You look like shit.
You should really chill.

54:53.482 --> 54:55.417
Yeah. Okay, so, um...

54:57.419 --> 55:01.390
I guess some of you may have
heard about the heroin epidemic.

55:03.924 --> 55:04.925
Um...

55:06.628 --> 55:08.263
So, I, uh...

55:09.464 --> 55:15.037
I was a straight A student
who never graduated high school.

55:17.639 --> 55:19.541
I live at home with my mom,

55:19.574 --> 55:23.011
but last week I was
sleeping on the streets.

55:27.015 --> 55:28.083
Don't have a job.

55:30.619 --> 55:33.921
Or any job skills
or a dollar to my name.

55:38.126 --> 55:41.363
Some of my teeth
aren't even mine.

55:53.008 --> 55:55.577
See that, um,
that lady in the back.

55:58.080 --> 55:59.081
It's my mom.

56:01.416 --> 56:04.919
She drove me here today

56:04.952 --> 56:09.391
because I, uh... my license was
suspended because of so many DUIs.

56:13.095 --> 56:15.163
But even if I did
have my license,

56:15.197 --> 56:17.432
she wouldn't trust me
with her car.

56:19.334 --> 56:20.669
Because I have...

56:20.702 --> 56:22.337
I have robbed her blind.

56:24.039 --> 56:27.908
Money, jewelry, credit cards.

56:30.379 --> 56:33.648
And I have...

56:33.682 --> 56:37.319
degraded myself

56:37.352 --> 56:38.520
for drugs, in ways...

56:44.159 --> 56:45.893
In ways that you don't
want to know.

56:48.730 --> 56:51.333
The only thing...

56:51.366 --> 56:55.670
The only thing I care
about is getting high

56:55.704 --> 56:58.573
because getting high
makes me forget

56:58.607 --> 57:01.942
about the mess that I have made
of my life getting high.

57:03.211 --> 57:04.279
Then just don't.

57:06.181 --> 57:07.182
Excuse me?

57:08.483 --> 57:10.951
Sorry. It's just...

57:10.985 --> 57:13.255
I would never
let myself fall that far.

57:16.324 --> 57:20.395
Right. Right,
of course.

57:20.429 --> 57:23.165
Do you know how many times
that I have told myself that?

57:23.198 --> 57:29.104
That I'm not going to
let myself steal to get high?

57:29.137 --> 57:35.177
That I'm not gonna let myself lose
custody of my children to get high?

57:35.210 --> 57:39.014
That I'm not gonna let myself
stab a needle into my arm?

57:39.047 --> 57:41.716
I'm not going to let myself
stab it into my chest.

57:43.752 --> 57:48.223
I have woken up
almost every morning

57:48.256 --> 57:51.493
for the past couple of years
and told myself

57:54.729 --> 57:57.265
that this is it.
That today...

57:58.433 --> 58:00.302
Today I'm not going to get high.

58:02.270 --> 58:06.508
And an hour, an hour later,
I am meeting up with my dealer

58:06.541 --> 58:07.609
to get high.

58:11.146 --> 58:14.749
I fail every single day.

58:19.754 --> 58:21.423
I'm so sorry, Mom.

58:28.196 --> 58:30.332
Oh, my God.

58:30.365 --> 58:33.368
I haven't seen you like that
for so long.

58:33.401 --> 58:34.703
Like what?

58:34.736 --> 58:39.708
Confident, honest.
Taking full responsibility.

58:39.741 --> 58:44.779
Just... I don't know.
Just being yourself.

58:44.813 --> 58:46.748
You should have seen the way
they were looking at you.

58:46.781 --> 58:48.149
Just riveted.

58:49.851 --> 58:51.052
Yeah, I feel good.

58:52.120 --> 58:53.522
Strong.

58:53.555 --> 58:56.525
If there's anyone who has the
strength to break free of this shit,

58:56.558 --> 58:58.159
it's you.

58:58.193 --> 58:59.427
I really believe that.

59:02.230 --> 59:03.231
I'm proud of you.

59:18.413 --> 59:19.414
Can you make a right up here?

59:20.882 --> 59:22.651
What for?

59:22.684 --> 59:24.052
I want to show you something.

59:27.556 --> 59:28.657
Pull over right here.

59:28.690 --> 59:30.026
- Here?
- Yeah.

59:35.363 --> 59:36.565
You see that building
over there?

59:38.767 --> 59:40.135
Eric and I used to live there.

59:41.169 --> 59:42.237
For how long?

59:43.605 --> 59:45.740
Year, year and a half.

59:48.276 --> 59:49.444
Were you terrified?

59:50.879 --> 59:52.080
I was high.

59:53.615 --> 59:56.484
Did you have
running water at least?

59:56.518 --> 59:59.287
Yeah, and room service.
Come on.

1:00:04.593 --> 1:00:07.629
You know, I've been wanting
to ask you something,

1:00:07.662 --> 1:00:10.899
but I do not want you
to take it in the wrong way.

1:00:10.932 --> 1:00:13.868
- Yeah.
- I just... No judgement.

1:00:13.902 --> 1:00:16.104
Okay. Just come out with it.

1:00:18.540 --> 1:00:19.541
Did you ever...

1:00:21.643 --> 1:00:22.877
prostitute yourself?

1:00:27.616 --> 1:00:29.217
I never had sex for money,

1:00:31.453 --> 1:00:33.355
but I have had sex for drugs.

1:00:33.388 --> 1:00:35.757
- Well, that's not prostitution.
- Well...

1:00:35.790 --> 1:00:37.392
No, that's survival.

1:00:37.425 --> 1:00:41.796
That's, uh, a sick person
trying to survive.

1:00:41.830 --> 1:00:44.366
Yeah, but if I had had sex
for money to buy drugs,

1:00:44.399 --> 1:00:46.134
would that make me a prostitute?

1:00:49.204 --> 1:00:50.639
So what's the verdict, Mom?

1:00:52.474 --> 1:00:55.744
Whore? Not whore?

1:00:58.613 --> 1:01:00.248
Wait, wait, wait, sorry.

1:01:00.281 --> 1:01:02.217
Since we're already here,
I meant to ask you,

1:01:02.250 --> 1:01:04.653
can we go and find
a friend of mine?

1:01:04.686 --> 1:01:08.189
Her name is Sammy,
we used to live together sometimes.

1:01:08.223 --> 1:01:09.658
- Who?
- Sammy?

1:01:09.691 --> 1:01:10.825
We used to look out
for each other.

1:01:10.859 --> 1:01:13.728
She texted me two days ago
from someone else's phone,

1:01:13.762 --> 1:01:15.363
and then she just vanished.

1:01:15.397 --> 1:01:16.564
I think that she's in trouble.

1:01:17.465 --> 1:01:18.933
Look, I want to go help her.

1:01:18.967 --> 1:01:22.237
- No, I don't want to stay.
- Come on, Mom, I would just like to help her.

1:01:22.270 --> 1:01:27.609
We're already here...
She's 15, Mom, she's 15.

1:01:31.613 --> 1:01:33.782
This isn't one of your schemes.

1:01:34.883 --> 1:01:37.252
You are so close
to getting that shot.

1:01:38.987 --> 1:01:40.188
Mom, look at me.

1:01:43.591 --> 1:01:44.726
I'm doing good.

1:01:45.727 --> 1:01:47.529
I just want to build momentum.

1:01:47.562 --> 1:01:50.632
I want to start helping people,
to just start making up

1:01:50.665 --> 1:01:53.668
for all the shit that I have
put everybody through.

1:01:53.702 --> 1:01:55.503
That's all.

1:01:55.537 --> 1:01:58.339
Please. I am begging you.
Just give me 15 minutes.

1:01:59.574 --> 1:02:02.744
Fine, five minutes.
I know where she lives.

1:02:04.979 --> 1:02:08.483
Mom, maybe if she sees me doing
good, it will help her get help.

1:02:13.955 --> 1:02:15.223
Please.

1:02:17.492 --> 1:02:19.928
- Five minutes.
- Okay, five minutes.

1:02:21.463 --> 1:02:22.464
Let's go.

1:02:36.411 --> 1:02:37.846
- Five minutes.
- Okay?

1:02:47.455 --> 1:02:50.325
She texted you.
How did she even get your phone number?

1:02:54.496 --> 1:02:56.865
- You're shopping?
- Excuse me?

1:02:56.898 --> 1:02:59.601
Are you buying?
You looking for a fix?

1:02:59.634 --> 1:03:01.503
Do I look like I'm shopping?

1:03:02.804 --> 1:03:06.307
Oh, shit. Mrs. Wheeler.

1:03:07.776 --> 1:03:11.546
It's me, Eric.
Molly's old boyfriend.

1:03:15.383 --> 1:03:18.386
- Jesus, Eric.
- What are you doing here?

1:03:18.419 --> 1:03:19.487
Molly's in there.

1:03:20.421 --> 1:03:22.423
She's just looking for a friend.

1:03:22.457 --> 1:03:25.326
She's clean, so
stay away from her.

1:03:26.061 --> 1:03:27.762
Oh...

1:03:27.796 --> 1:03:29.964
Oh, I don't think
that she wants to see me.

1:03:31.533 --> 1:03:33.635
I haven't seen her
since she was pregnant.

1:03:35.003 --> 1:03:36.838
She warned me at the clinic.

1:03:40.042 --> 1:03:42.077
Oh, shit.

1:03:42.111 --> 1:03:43.645
She didn't tell you.

1:03:44.712 --> 1:03:47.582
Of course she did.

1:03:47.615 --> 1:03:51.086
You wouldn't happen to have a couple
of dollars that I could borrow.

1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:53.388
Mrs. Wheeler, I'm hungry.

1:04:00.562 --> 1:04:01.896
Molly, come on!

1:04:10.405 --> 1:04:12.407
- Hey.
- Get in the car.

1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:13.641
They said that she's
staying down the street.

1:04:13.675 --> 1:04:14.909
I'm just gonna go
and check real quick.

1:04:14.943 --> 1:04:16.711
No way. Are you crazy?

1:04:16.744 --> 1:04:18.346
Does Sammy even exist?

1:04:19.714 --> 1:04:20.849
Fuck you!

1:04:20.882 --> 1:04:23.085
Get in the goddamn car!

1:04:33.728 --> 1:04:34.996
Just get in the car!

1:04:43.605 --> 1:04:45.773
Molly! Please!

1:04:48.710 --> 1:04:50.012
I'll leave you!

1:04:50.045 --> 1:04:52.147
You think I fucking
give a shit?

1:04:52.181 --> 1:04:53.381
Watch me!

1:04:55.884 --> 1:04:59.121
You fucking ungrateful bitch!

1:06:02.284 --> 1:06:04.053
Moly, what the fuck are you...

1:06:13.095 --> 1:06:16.664
Molly, I am so done
with your fucking...

1:06:16.698 --> 1:06:18.167
- What are you doing here?
- This is Sammy.

1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:19.934
I'm just trying
to get her temperature down.

1:06:19.968 --> 1:06:22.071
- What you got in your hand?
- She's dope sick with drugs.

1:06:22.104 --> 1:06:24.206
- Come with me right now.
- Calm the fuck down.

1:06:24.239 --> 1:06:25.807
- Stop it!
- What the fuck!

1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:26.975
- What are you doing here?
- Who are you?

1:06:27.009 --> 1:06:28.810
Do you think I'm scared of you?

1:06:28.843 --> 1:06:31.013
No! No, no!

1:06:31.046 --> 1:06:33.514
You fucked up!
You got me fucked up now.

1:06:33.548 --> 1:06:36.218
- Greg, that's my mom. Stop!
- What? What?

1:06:36.251 --> 1:06:39.587
You people are monsters,
you hear me?

1:06:39.620 --> 1:06:42.523
- You deserve to die. I'll kill you myself!
- What is wrong with you?

1:06:42.557 --> 1:06:44.126
You almost got
both of us killed.

1:06:44.159 --> 1:06:48.030
Jesus! You are unhinged!
You are scaring me!

1:06:48.063 --> 1:06:49.231
Now know what it's like.

1:06:50.732 --> 1:06:52.633
I was just trying
to help Sammy.

1:07:36.611 --> 1:07:38.613
I saw Eric today.

1:07:39.981 --> 1:07:41.050
Who?

1:07:42.117 --> 1:07:44.253
Guitar Eric, your boyfriend.

1:07:46.921 --> 1:07:50.825
- Where?
- Outside that flop house.

1:07:50.858 --> 1:07:55.130
He came over to the car
trying to sell me some drugs.

1:07:55.164 --> 1:07:57.598
Mom, I swear to God,
I did not know that he was there.

1:07:59.201 --> 1:08:02.337
If you think that I was trying
to scheme you, I wasn't.

1:08:02.371 --> 1:08:03.638
He...

1:08:04.939 --> 1:08:09.278
He said something
about you being pregnant.

1:08:12.381 --> 1:08:13.614
I'm not judging you.

1:08:15.250 --> 1:08:19.254
Eric said you...
you didn't want him to be with you.

1:08:19.288 --> 1:08:22.690
I'm just sorry that you had
to go through that alone.

1:08:22.723 --> 1:08:24.859
An abortion is hard enough
as it is.

1:08:30.232 --> 1:08:34.236
I didn't have an abortion,
I carried it to term.

1:08:37.772 --> 1:08:40.975
Spent seven months
puking every morning

1:08:41.009 --> 1:08:44.079
from morning sickness
and withdrawals

1:08:45.380 --> 1:08:46.914
and staying on couches.

1:08:49.451 --> 1:08:51.186
That was hardest thing
I've ever done.

1:08:58.193 --> 1:08:59.261
Beautiful baby though.

1:09:00.928 --> 1:09:01.996
A boy.

1:09:04.266 --> 1:09:06.368
Where is he?

1:09:06.401 --> 1:09:09.904
In New Jersey,
with a family in their forties.

1:09:11.273 --> 1:09:13.175
No kids, rich enough
to have a boat.

1:09:13.208 --> 1:09:14.775
That's what
the agency told me.

1:09:16.711 --> 1:09:18.080
When... When did this happen?

1:09:19.248 --> 1:09:21.450
Why didn't you call me?

1:09:21.483 --> 1:09:25.720
Because I didn't want another
thing to feel shitty about.

1:09:27.022 --> 1:09:28.190
What's his name?

1:09:28.223 --> 1:09:29.224
I don't know.

1:09:30.325 --> 1:09:32.361
Can I meet him?
Do you get visits?

1:09:32.394 --> 1:09:35.763
No. It's a closed adoption
just like I wanted.

1:09:35.796 --> 1:09:36.898
Well, can I write them a letter?

1:09:36.931 --> 1:09:38.267
No!

1:09:38.300 --> 1:09:39.767
Molly, that's my grandson.

1:10:06.028 --> 1:10:07.129
Yeah, hello.

1:10:08.130 --> 1:10:09.264
Yeah, this is Molly.

1:10:11.466 --> 1:10:15.836
We already scheduled the shot with
Dr. Ortiz for 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

1:10:17.972 --> 1:10:20.775
No, no, no, I can't wait.

1:10:21.410 --> 1:10:22.910
No!

1:10:22.944 --> 1:10:24.745
Can you, can you please
just talk to Dr. Ortiz?

1:10:24.779 --> 1:10:26.281
Because he knows
that this is urgent.

1:10:26.914 --> 1:10:28.983
Please.

1:10:29.017 --> 1:10:30.851
Oh, my God! Are you serious?

1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:33.988
Stop!

1:10:34.855 --> 1:10:36.458
Okay.

1:10:36.491 --> 1:10:38.060
Yeah, we'll see you on Monday.

1:10:38.993 --> 1:10:40.028
Okay. So what was that?

1:10:41.363 --> 1:10:42.464
Three more days.

1:10:42.497 --> 1:10:43.699
Three more days
that they're waiting

1:10:43.731 --> 1:10:45.900
- for my insurance papers to go through.
- That's bullshit.

1:10:45.933 --> 1:10:47.001
I don't think I can make it.

1:10:47.035 --> 1:10:49.904
Do you have any fucking idea
how hard it is for us

1:10:49.937 --> 1:10:51.939
to get through one goddamn day?

1:10:51.973 --> 1:10:54.042
Three days is a death sentence.

1:10:54.076 --> 1:10:56.044
- It's an eternity.
- Jesus, you're not helping.

1:11:09.991 --> 1:11:12.060
Insurance companies.
They run the fucking world.

1:11:12.094 --> 1:11:13.528
Why didn't I hear
your phone ring?

1:11:16.031 --> 1:11:17.332
- What?
- Your phone?

1:11:17.366 --> 1:11:18.899
Why didn't I hear it ring?

1:11:18.933 --> 1:11:20.469
Because it was on vibrate.

1:11:20.502 --> 1:11:22.803
Why is the office still open?

1:11:22.837 --> 1:11:24.506
It's after six o'clock.

1:11:24.539 --> 1:11:26.807
- I don't know.
- I want to see your phone.

1:11:26.841 --> 1:11:28.310
- Give me your phone.
- Are you fucking crazy?

1:11:28.343 --> 1:11:29.745
- Am I crazy?
- Yes.

1:11:29.777 --> 1:11:32.481
How many fake phone calls have
you made since you hurt your knee?

1:11:32.514 --> 1:11:34.249
Or did you ever even
hurt your knee?

1:11:34.283 --> 1:11:36.018
- Must've been lies from the very beginning.
- You serious?

1:11:36.051 --> 1:11:37.219
Are you doing this
to me right now?

1:11:37.252 --> 1:11:39.087
- Oh, my God.
- Just never ends.

1:11:39.121 --> 1:11:40.955
No! You're such a trigger!

1:11:40.988 --> 1:11:42.090
But it just goes on and on.

1:11:42.124 --> 1:11:44.393
I am so sorry

1:11:44.426 --> 1:11:46.428
that my drug addiction

1:11:46.461 --> 1:11:49.231
is so incredibly difficult
on you.

1:11:52.067 --> 1:11:55.470
Look, I, I am not going to make
it to Monday if I stay here.

1:12:00.208 --> 1:12:03.345
I'm gonna go to Sean's,
I'm gonna go stay with Sean.

1:12:03.378 --> 1:12:05.180
He... he said that he can
pick me up.

1:12:05.213 --> 1:12:07.115
It will be good.
I can see the kids.

1:12:07.149 --> 1:12:09.318
- I could be with the kids...
- What Sean?

1:12:09.351 --> 1:12:12.120
The same Sean who wanted
you to score for him?

1:12:12.154 --> 1:12:14.022
Do you hear yourself?

1:12:14.056 --> 1:12:16.425
I mean, do you fucking
hear yourself?

1:12:17.192 --> 1:12:18.859
Do you?

1:12:18.893 --> 1:12:23.265
If I say it's sunny outside,
are you gonna go and check?

1:12:23.298 --> 1:12:24.499
I might have to.

1:12:26.068 --> 1:12:27.935
Well, then, maybe
when I'm dead,

1:12:27.968 --> 1:12:31.939
you can tell yourself,
"Hmm, she's just pretending."

1:12:35.310 --> 1:12:36.378
All right.

1:12:39.081 --> 1:12:40.915
Do what you're gonna do.

1:13:15.517 --> 1:13:16.585
So, uh...

1:13:19.187 --> 1:13:20.188
I'll see you Monday at 8:00.

1:13:23.525 --> 1:13:24.526
Yes.

1:13:33.168 --> 1:13:34.236
I love you.

1:13:48.517 --> 1:13:49.551
You all right?

1:13:49.584 --> 1:13:50.685
Yeah.

1:14:11.573 --> 1:14:12.674
You okay?

1:14:12.707 --> 1:14:13.708
Yeah.

1:14:14.810 --> 1:14:18.547
You can't go down the hole
with her every time, Deb.

1:14:18.580 --> 1:14:20.081
You got to put yourself first.

1:14:21.583 --> 1:14:23.652
You know, sometimes
it just...

1:14:25.287 --> 1:14:27.456
Sometimes, I feel
that you're patronizing me.

1:14:27.489 --> 1:14:29.224
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:14:29.257 --> 1:14:32.160
Just feeding me
pat little phrases.

1:14:32.194 --> 1:14:34.995
- Does that make you happy?
- Okay.

1:14:35.030 --> 1:14:36.531
Oh, don't fucking walk away.

1:14:43.038 --> 1:14:44.039
Well, say something.

1:14:46.241 --> 1:14:47.476
You're such a wimp.

1:14:51.079 --> 1:14:52.147
What?

1:14:53.048 --> 1:14:55.550
What, Chris? Say something.

1:14:55.584 --> 1:14:57.219
Saint fucking Chris.

1:14:57.252 --> 1:14:59.087
You wanna have a fight,
is that it?

1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:00.355
Huh?

1:15:00.388 --> 1:15:02.757
You want... You want us to have
a knockdown, drag out fight

1:15:02.791 --> 1:15:04.759
so you can blow off
some fucking steam?

1:15:04.793 --> 1:15:08.196
I'm not your fucking
punching bag, Deb!

1:15:08.230 --> 1:15:11.066
I'm not your fucking
punching bag!

1:15:13.568 --> 1:15:14.703
Oh, God!

1:15:15.804 --> 1:15:17.339
- I'm sorry.
- Stop.

1:15:17.372 --> 1:15:20.609
- I'm sorry.
- Just stop apologizing, it's annoying.

1:15:22.777 --> 1:15:24.212
How did I get here?

1:15:25.146 --> 1:15:26.248
What did I do?

1:15:28.416 --> 1:15:29.584
Nothing.

1:15:29.885 --> 1:15:31.253
You...

1:15:32.454 --> 1:15:33.755
You...

1:15:33.788 --> 1:15:35.390
have done nothing.

1:15:36.791 --> 1:15:40.629
You know, maybe it's just
the way her brain is wired.

1:15:40.962 --> 1:15:41.897
You know?

1:15:41.930 --> 1:15:46.334
Maybe she'd taken the pills
the year before,

1:15:46.368 --> 1:15:48.703
or a year after, she wouldn't
have gotten hooked.

1:15:50.605 --> 1:15:54.809
But she needed to be high because
she was too sensitive, but not...

1:15:54.843 --> 1:15:58.280
sensitive enough or if you'd
stayed in your bad marriage,

1:15:58.313 --> 1:16:02.450
she would have been
an even bigger addict.

1:16:02.484 --> 1:16:05.554
Or if you bought her
those blue shoes that time

1:16:05.587 --> 1:16:08.156
when she was three,
instead of the red.

1:16:09.558 --> 1:16:11.826
It's none of that.

1:16:11.860 --> 1:16:17.699
Because maybe, the moment her
father's sperm reached your egg,

1:16:17.732 --> 1:16:22.237
she was already an addict,
waiting to happen.

1:16:33.381 --> 1:16:34.382
Okay.

1:16:59.741 --> 1:17:00.742
Thank you.

1:17:01.743 --> 1:17:03.211
...never ends.

1:17:03.244 --> 1:17:05.847
I still get panic attacks
when there's a siren.

1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:07.782
Even one on TV.

1:17:07.816 --> 1:17:10.785
Every time the phone rings,
my heart stops.

1:17:10.819 --> 1:17:14.556
My old ring tone makes me
pee, literally.

1:17:14.589 --> 1:17:17.459
I was at the pharmacy
and the lady next to me,

1:17:17.492 --> 1:17:20.528
had it on her phone,
I nearly wet myself when I heard it.

1:17:23.632 --> 1:17:27.769
This new shrink diagnosed me
with chronic anxiety.

1:17:27.802 --> 1:17:31.506
He wants to give
me something to help me sleep.

1:17:31.539 --> 1:17:33.541
I said I can't keep pills
at the house.

1:17:34.743 --> 1:17:36.211
So I keep them at work.

1:17:37.345 --> 1:17:39.447
Take one pill home
every evening.

1:17:42.417 --> 1:17:43.685
Let go and let God...

1:17:46.254 --> 1:17:47.689
This too shall pass.

1:17:49.391 --> 1:17:50.925
Time takes time.

1:17:55.330 --> 1:17:56.398
It helps me...

1:17:57.332 --> 1:18:02.270
to believe
in these platitudes.

1:18:04.506 --> 1:18:06.508
I'd be even more resentful
and angry

1:18:06.541 --> 1:18:09.177
if I didn't repeat
this stuff to myself.

1:18:10.412 --> 1:18:12.414
I'd be furious...

1:18:12.447 --> 1:18:15.684
for all, all the dead dreams.

1:18:21.923 --> 1:18:24.793
<i>At the tone, please record your message.</i>

1:18:24.826 --> 1:18:26.928
Hey, I hope you're having fun
with the kids.

1:18:26.961 --> 1:18:30.465
I'm just checking in with
with you about tomorrow.

1:18:30.498 --> 1:18:34.736
Um, I'm really happy
you're doing this.

1:18:34.769 --> 1:18:36.705
I know it's not been
an easy week,

1:18:36.738 --> 1:18:39.808
and I can be a real hard-ass.

1:18:40.742 --> 1:18:41.910
It's just that...

1:18:43.545 --> 1:18:46.948
someday, I want things
to be easier for you, you know?

1:18:46.981 --> 1:18:49.484
You deserve good things.

1:18:49.517 --> 1:18:52.520
All right. So, um, bye,
call me back.

1:18:53.455 --> 1:18:54.622
I love you.

1:19:58.353 --> 1:20:00.622
Dale, pick up the fucking phone.

1:20:00.655 --> 1:20:03.525
<i>Hey, this is Dale.
Leave a message... or don't.</i>

1:20:03.558 --> 1:20:05.426
Damn it!

1:20:24.979 --> 1:20:26.681
What the fuck?

1:20:26.714 --> 1:20:28.716
- Do you know what time it is?
- Is he here?

1:20:34.123 --> 1:20:35.390
Dale.

1:20:40.095 --> 1:20:41.329
Fuck.

1:20:43.932 --> 1:20:45.366
Have you heard from Molly?

1:20:46.467 --> 1:20:47.468
No. Why?

1:20:48.037 --> 1:20:49.737
Why?

1:20:49.771 --> 1:20:52.407
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Did you even bother to call her?

1:20:53.908 --> 1:20:55.844
Why the hell not?

1:20:55.877 --> 1:20:57.445
This is your daughter's life.

1:20:57.478 --> 1:20:58.847
Because I can't control it, Deb.

1:20:58.880 --> 1:21:01.449
Oh, come on, Dale.

1:21:01.482 --> 1:21:05.386
She's one day away from getting a shot
that might actually save her life.

1:21:05.420 --> 1:21:08.389
And God knows where she is
and you don't give a shit.

1:21:08.423 --> 1:21:10.692
I give a shit.

1:21:10.725 --> 1:21:13.895
I give a shit. There's not a day that
goes by that I don't think about her.

1:21:13.928 --> 1:21:15.797
But it's not up to me
to change any of that.

1:21:15.830 --> 1:21:18.600
And God knows I've fooled myself
time and time again before.

1:21:18.633 --> 1:21:20.102
And so did you.

1:21:20.135 --> 1:21:22.971
- I'm done.
- Oh, God. That's so convenient.

1:21:23.004 --> 1:21:25.907
I thought you said that you weren't gonna
let her back in until she was clean.

1:21:25.940 --> 1:21:28.110
- She's been clean a week.
- Oh.

1:21:28.143 --> 1:21:30.778
Oh, boy. Well, when it's real,
you let me know.

1:21:30.812 --> 1:21:32.580
So you want us
to do all the work?

1:21:32.614 --> 1:21:35.483
You're not doing
the fucking work, Deb.

1:21:35.516 --> 1:21:37.752
She's doing it.
If in fact, she's even doing it.

1:21:37.785 --> 1:21:39.787
So don't fucking
flatter yourself here.

1:21:39.821 --> 1:21:42.191
By the way, you're not going to make
me feel guilty about this either,

1:21:42.224 --> 1:21:43.625
so why don't you kiss my ass?

1:21:43.658 --> 1:21:45.927
You know what? We wouldn't even
be standing here

1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:48.097
if you paid more attention
to her when she got that injury.

1:21:48.130 --> 1:21:49.831
You wanna say this is my fault?

1:21:49.864 --> 1:21:51.267
Is that the game
you want to play?

1:21:51.300 --> 1:21:56.071
Let's. You walked out on us because
you wanted to find the new you.

1:21:56.105 --> 1:21:58.773
She wanted her mom back,
she wanted her mom's attention,

1:21:58.806 --> 1:22:01.010
and that's exactly what
she friggin' got, didn't she?

1:22:01.043 --> 1:22:02.710
Fuck, you, Dale!

1:22:02.744 --> 1:22:04.679
Save the speeches
for her funeral.

1:22:04.712 --> 1:22:06.581
Oh, you're planning
her funeral now, huh?

1:22:06.614 --> 1:22:09.218
You have a flair
for drama there, don't you, Deb?

1:22:09.251 --> 1:22:11.053
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1:22:46.188 --> 1:22:47.455
Any news?

1:22:48.523 --> 1:22:49.557
Mm-mm.

1:22:58.033 --> 1:22:59.600
<i>Door...</i>

1:22:59.634 --> 1:23:01.836
- Where the hell have you been?
- Hey!

1:23:01.869 --> 1:23:02.904
What the fuck?

1:23:03.604 --> 1:23:05.174
I've been trying to call you.

1:23:05.207 --> 1:23:06.674
My phone died.

1:23:06.708 --> 1:23:08.010
Why aren't you ready?

1:23:08.043 --> 1:23:10.045
We have to be there
in, like, 45 minutes.

1:23:11.313 --> 1:23:12.580
All right.

1:23:14.615 --> 1:23:15.683
Come on.

1:23:23.025 --> 1:23:24.559
Okay, I'm almost there.

1:23:25.827 --> 1:23:26.861
How are the kids?

1:23:28.097 --> 1:23:29.530
They're good.

1:23:29.564 --> 1:23:30.898
Yeah, they, um...

1:23:32.201 --> 1:23:33.601
They say hi.

1:23:39.341 --> 1:23:40.541
What?

1:23:41.976 --> 1:23:42.977
Um...

1:23:46.981 --> 1:23:48.250
I need your pee.

1:23:50.019 --> 1:23:51.552
What?

1:23:51.586 --> 1:23:54.756
I said I need your pee, like,
in a plastic container.

1:23:54.789 --> 1:23:56.858
I need your pee, now.

1:24:00.928 --> 1:24:02.697
Do I have to
spell it out for you?

1:24:04.599 --> 1:24:05.767
I'm not clean.

1:24:09.238 --> 1:24:12.307
The other day when when we went
looking for Sammy, I, um...

1:24:14.009 --> 1:24:15.210
I met up with a dealer.

1:24:17.112 --> 1:24:18.280
With what money?

1:24:20.815 --> 1:24:21.849
Oh.

1:24:22.617 --> 1:24:24.019
You fucking thief.

1:24:27.189 --> 1:24:28.623
And the appointment?

1:24:29.391 --> 1:24:30.725
I faked it.

1:24:32.194 --> 1:24:33.228
I'm sorry.

1:24:34.396 --> 1:24:37.598
And the weekend,
visiting the kids?

1:24:38.766 --> 1:24:40.169
No, I saw them.

1:24:40.202 --> 1:24:43.805
I did. I even took them
to the movies, but then, um...

1:24:45.374 --> 1:24:48.609
Then Sean and I got a sitter
and we went out, uh...

1:24:52.214 --> 1:24:53.348
I got high.

1:24:57.652 --> 1:24:59.620
I'm sorry I suck.

1:25:01.956 --> 1:25:03.991
I'm a terrible person.

1:25:11.100 --> 1:25:13.801
I am a fucking moron.

1:25:14.470 --> 1:25:17.738
No, no, because I'm here now.

1:25:17.772 --> 1:25:19.941
Look, I could have
stayed back at Sean's,

1:25:19.974 --> 1:25:22.643
or met back up with Eric
or just disappeared.

1:25:22.677 --> 1:25:24.812
But... But I didn't...

1:25:24.846 --> 1:25:28.083
I don't want to do this
anymore, okay?

1:25:28.117 --> 1:25:30.285
Please. I just want
to get the shot.

1:25:30.319 --> 1:25:32.020
- Well, you can't, Molly. It's over.
- Yes, I can.

1:25:32.054 --> 1:25:34.056
You have drugs in your system.

1:25:34.089 --> 1:25:36.024
Maybe you could
wait for another week.

1:25:36.058 --> 1:25:38.093
I am not gonna make it
another week,

1:25:38.127 --> 1:25:40.028
and you and I both know that.

1:25:40.062 --> 1:25:41.629
Mom, please.

1:25:43.232 --> 1:25:45.100
Please, just give me your pee.

1:25:45.134 --> 1:25:47.702
If you give me your pee,
I can pass the drug test.

1:25:47.735 --> 1:25:48.970
I can get the shot.

1:25:49.003 --> 1:25:53.408
And that means that I can't
get high for an entire month.

1:25:53.442 --> 1:25:56.145
No, you, you have drugs
in your system.

1:25:56.178 --> 1:25:58.046
- No.
- Mom, please.

1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:01.283
Please, I am begging you
for help to get clean.

1:26:02.950 --> 1:26:06.188
Look, this could be it, okay?

1:26:06.221 --> 1:26:08.290
It's like what you said
on the message last night

1:26:08.323 --> 1:26:10.758
about this being the start
of something new.

1:26:11.893 --> 1:26:13.728
It is.

1:26:13.761 --> 1:26:15.397
I thought your phone was dead.

1:26:17.832 --> 1:26:18.900
Fuck.

1:26:26.908 --> 1:26:27.975
Oh.

1:27:12.087 --> 1:27:13.121
Thank you.

1:27:20.429 --> 1:27:21.496
Oh, my God.

1:27:26.168 --> 1:27:28.070
What if they check
the temperature of the pee?

1:27:30.938 --> 1:27:33.275
- What?
- The pee was barely lukewarm.

1:27:33.308 --> 1:27:35.177
What if they check...

1:27:35.210 --> 1:27:37.012
Why am I freaking out?

1:27:37.045 --> 1:27:38.846
Well, don't.

1:27:40.582 --> 1:27:41.816
Okay.

1:27:43.218 --> 1:27:44.419
Everything here looks good.

1:27:46.488 --> 1:27:47.489
Ready to go?

1:27:48.090 --> 1:27:49.458
Yeah.

1:27:49.491 --> 1:27:51.426
- Uh, I'll step out.
- No.

1:27:52.461 --> 1:27:53.495
Mm-mm.

1:28:05.307 --> 1:28:06.375
All right.

1:28:13.115 --> 1:28:14.116
All set.

1:28:45.347 --> 1:28:46.847
What?

1:28:46.881 --> 1:28:47.915
How are you feeling?

1:28:48.650 --> 1:28:51.353
Fine. Yeah.

1:28:51.386 --> 1:28:52.887
All right.

1:28:52.920 --> 1:28:55.357
You'll get a follow up call at the end
of the day to see how you're doing.

1:28:55.390 --> 1:28:57.192
I'll see you in a month.
Congratulations.

1:28:57.225 --> 1:28:58.293
Thank you.

1:29:06.601 --> 1:29:07.902
Oh, my God.

1:29:10.971 --> 1:29:12.007
I'm okay.

1:29:12.407 --> 1:29:13.841
I am. I, um...

1:29:15.344 --> 1:29:16.378
I feel good.

1:29:16.411 --> 1:29:17.646
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:29:17.679 --> 1:29:18.946
Oh, my God.

1:29:20.082 --> 1:29:21.249
Yeah.

1:29:21.283 --> 1:29:23.085
Oh, my God. You look good.

1:29:23.118 --> 1:29:24.286
- Yeah.
- I can't believe it.

1:29:24.319 --> 1:29:27.888
Thirty days without having
to worry about this nightmare.

1:29:27.922 --> 1:29:29.157
Yeah.

1:29:29.191 --> 1:29:31.093
Can't believe
I went through with it.

1:29:31.126 --> 1:29:32.394
Pretty damn brave.

1:29:33.128 --> 1:29:34.529
Oh, my God.

1:29:34.563 --> 1:29:38.500
I always knew your talent for lying
would, you know, come in handy.

1:29:40.268 --> 1:29:42.037
We fucking pulled it off.

1:29:43.038 --> 1:29:45.040
You hungry?

1:29:45.073 --> 1:29:46.274
Wanna grab some breakfast?

1:29:52.947 --> 1:29:53.948
What?

1:30:01.223 --> 1:30:03.625
Oh, my God! Get in the car.
Get in the car. Quick.

1:30:03.658 --> 1:30:07.162
- Oh, my God!
- Here. Quick, quick. Get in. Get in.

1:30:07.195 --> 1:30:10.998
Can you close the door? Get in.

1:30:11.032 --> 1:30:13.968
- Let me just get...
- Don't fucking touch me. Fuck!

1:30:14.469 --> 1:30:15.704
Oh, my God.

1:30:15.737 --> 1:30:18.407
Oh, just fucking drive.

1:30:18.440 --> 1:30:20.709
God. Just drive!

1:30:20.742 --> 1:30:22.077
Oh!

1:30:29.618 --> 1:30:32.020
I can't. I can't...

1:30:32.053 --> 1:30:34.122
Oh, my God. I can't. I can't...

1:30:34.156 --> 1:30:35.290
I know, I know, I know...

1:30:35.323 --> 1:30:36.691
Why did we do this?

1:30:36.725 --> 1:30:38.660
Oh, why the fuck did we do this?

1:30:38.693 --> 1:30:41.329
Can we have some
help out here, please?

1:30:42.197 --> 1:30:43.931
Anyone? I need some help.

1:30:49.671 --> 1:30:51.740
Please, somebody help us.

1:30:51.773 --> 1:30:53.442
She's in acute withdrawal.

1:30:53.475 --> 1:30:55.010
- Heroin?
- Yes, heroin.

1:30:55.043 --> 1:30:57.045
Just get us back there.
I've never seen her like this.

1:30:57.078 --> 1:30:58.680
We can restrain her.
We can give her fluids.

1:30:58.713 --> 1:31:00.148
But she's gonna
have to go through it.

1:31:00.182 --> 1:31:01.650
She just had
the Naltrexone shot.

1:31:01.683 --> 1:31:03.685
She's not supposed to get that
if she has drugs in her system.

1:31:03.718 --> 1:31:05.654
No shit, Sherlock.

1:31:05.687 --> 1:31:08.023
Doctor, please, can you help?
She's in acute withdrawal.

1:31:08.056 --> 1:31:09.758
Miss, can you sign this form?

1:31:09.791 --> 1:31:11.992
But, ma'am, she has to sign herself.

1:31:12.027 --> 1:31:13.562
- She can't sign it.
- Fine!

1:31:15.030 --> 1:31:16.131
Okay, we'll call you.

1:31:16.164 --> 1:31:17.632
Seriously?

1:31:20.602 --> 1:31:23.472
It's okay. Okay. It's okay.

1:31:23.505 --> 1:31:25.973
Oh. Oh, Mom, please,
make it stop.

1:31:29.344 --> 1:31:31.580
Can we have some
fucking help here?

1:31:33.148 --> 1:31:35.350
- Make it stop.
- I know, I know.

1:31:35.383 --> 1:31:36.451
- Here.
- Thank you.

1:31:36.485 --> 1:31:38.353
I'm begging you.

1:31:38.386 --> 1:31:40.722
- No.
- I'm so sorry, Mom.

1:31:40.755 --> 1:31:42.190
Please, I can't do this.

1:31:42.224 --> 1:31:44.192
Yes, you can.

1:31:44.726 --> 1:31:46.194
Are you enjoying this?

1:31:46.228 --> 1:31:47.729
I don't fucking
believe you people.

1:31:47.762 --> 1:31:51.600
She's been convulsing and puking
for, I don't know how long.

1:31:51.633 --> 1:31:53.735
What does it take to get seen?

1:31:53.768 --> 1:31:55.604
It is called a waiting room
for a reason.

1:31:55.637 --> 1:31:58.073
- Sometimes you wait.
- There's no one else here.

1:31:58.106 --> 1:31:59.641
We take people
based on the complaint

1:31:59.674 --> 1:32:01.743
and some thing's demand
more immediate attention.

1:32:01.776 --> 1:32:04.179
Thank you for your compassion.

1:32:06.381 --> 1:32:08.416
Do you want to know
why she's an addict?

1:32:08.450 --> 1:32:09.751
It's because of you people.

1:32:09.784 --> 1:32:11.319
So don't you sit there

1:32:11.353 --> 1:32:13.455
- and fucking tell me...
- Hey, whoa! Whoa!

1:32:14.823 --> 1:32:16.057
Is everything okay?

1:32:19.294 --> 1:32:21.263
- Doctor, please.
- Molly Wheeler.

1:32:21.296 --> 1:32:23.465
Oh... Okay, sweetie.

1:32:23.498 --> 1:32:24.733
- The doctor's here.
- I got it.

1:32:24.766 --> 1:32:26.301
- He's gonna take good care of you, all right?
- Thank you.

1:32:26.334 --> 1:32:28.336
We're gonna take
real good care of you.

1:32:28.370 --> 1:32:30.071
Ma.

1:32:30.105 --> 1:32:31.339
- Ma.
- I'm here. I'm here, sweetie.

1:32:31.373 --> 1:32:32.541
Mom, don't leave.

1:33:41.643 --> 1:33:43.178
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:33:44.779 --> 1:33:45.847
How are the kids?

1:33:46.781 --> 1:33:48.416
They're good.

1:33:48.450 --> 1:33:50.452
You know, Cory's still
got that cold.

1:33:51.419 --> 1:33:52.854
Chloe never got it.

1:33:52.887 --> 1:33:55.657
I don't get it. That kid
lives off of junk food.

1:33:55.690 --> 1:33:57.258
And never gets sick.

1:33:58.493 --> 1:33:59.861
Kids are indestructible.

1:34:02.731 --> 1:34:04.833
Hey, so, um...

1:34:04.866 --> 1:34:09.204
Sean wants me to come back again
on Friday and watch the kids.

1:34:09.237 --> 1:34:11.873
I think it's good, you know,
him trusting me more.

1:34:11.906 --> 1:34:13.174
Mm-hm.

1:34:15.577 --> 1:34:18.880
Say, isn't Friday when you
need to get your shot?

1:34:18.913 --> 1:34:20.415
Yes, but it's no big deal.

1:34:20.448 --> 1:34:22.751
They said they can see me
first thing next week.

1:34:22.784 --> 1:34:24.486
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

1:34:24.519 --> 1:34:26.855
- You called them?
- Yes.

1:34:26.888 --> 1:34:28.523
Yeah. Monday, three o'clock.

1:34:31.526 --> 1:34:32.560
What?

1:34:33.228 --> 1:34:34.229
Uh...

1:34:35.397 --> 1:34:36.431
Nothing.

1:34:37.232 --> 1:34:38.700
Not a thing.

1:34:38.733 --> 1:34:39.934
You look wonderful.
