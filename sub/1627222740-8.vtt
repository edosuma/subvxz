- What are you talking about?

38:21.211 --> 38:24.171
- We haven't
been here all day.

38:24.214 --> 38:25.955

in the living room.

Sometimes,

I think I'm trying
to be something

38:43.973 --> 38:46.759
I don't know that I can be.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.415

someone said?

- Well...yeah.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.385
You know, Beth,

39:04.429 --> 39:07.693
when we first moved
to Blue Valley,

39:07.736 --> 39:11.218
there had never been another
Black doctor working here.

39:11.261 --> 39:13.046
I came in to replace Dr. Brady,

39:13.089 --> 39:16.354

He had been working in
this town for over 50 years.

39:23.056 --> 39:25.754
And people loved him

39:25.798 --> 39:28.191
with good reason.

39:28.235 --> 39:31.804
But they didn't know
what to make of me.

39:33.283 --> 39:34.546
- That had to be hard.

39:34.589 --> 39:36.809
- Yeah.

39:36.852 --> 39:40.813
They didn't trust
that I could do the job.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.467
- How'd you handle that?

39:42.510 --> 39:44.425
- [chuckles]

39:44.469 --> 39:47.646
Well, I did my job
the best I knew how.

39:47.689 --> 39:50.518

than anyone.

40:02.704 --> 40:05.228
- And eventually,

40:05.272 --> 40:08.623
I won Blue Valley over.

Beth, you can be
anything you want to be

40:15.195 --> 40:17.545
because you're our daughter.
- Mm.

40:17.589 --> 40:20.461
- You'll work hard because
that's what this family does.

no matter what they look like,

40:24.117 --> 40:26.511

What are you wearing?

40:44.920 --> 40:46.661
- Oh, these?

40:46.705 --> 40:48.054
These are for swimming.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.186
I'm gonna join the swim team.

they can do for Rick, but--

41:22.131 --> 41:25.613
