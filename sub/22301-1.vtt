03:42.179 --> 03:43.931
That's Massimo Bottura!

03:53.816 --> 03:55.151
Wait.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.030
Ma'am...

03:59.113 --> 04:01.491
how are these?
These chanterelles?

04:01.574 --> 04:04.035
The chanterelles are good.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.538
The porcini are no good.
You have to come in the morning

04:06.621 --> 04:08.039
to get porcini mushrooms.

04:08.122 --> 04:09.123
Wait, what's this?

04:09.206 --> 04:13.044
Caesar's mushrooms.
The Caesar's mushrooms are good.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.128
They're a little...

04:14.211 --> 04:17.632
There are some good ones. Look!

04:18.841 --> 04:20.927
I'll have good ones
in the morning, Massimo.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.887
Tomorrow morning,
we'll come tomorrow morning.

04:22.970 --> 04:25.598
You could get them now,
but come a little earlier.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.600
I'll come around 9:30, 10:00.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.602
-Yes, when the good stuff is on display.
-Okay.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.564
-Now, this morning I have...
-Okay.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.065
Bye.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.317
Have a nice day.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.485
Hey there.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.779
Look, it's the maestro.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.781
Give me, give me a...

04:41.864 --> 04:44.701
One of the, the...

04:46.828 --> 04:48.746
The ones in front that just came out.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.832
Give me that one in front, how is it?

04:52.792 --> 04:53.793
Will you split it with me?

04:53.876 --> 04:56.879
Yes, with pleasure.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.218
My God, it's good.

05:05.305 --> 05:09.225
Can you send some of this to Francescana?

05:09.309 --> 05:13.229
A mixture, half a crate of these
and half of these.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.523
Really, really good ones.
Do you have...

05:15.607 --> 05:17.525
These are the...

06:51.911 --> 06:54.789
He's the most important chef in Italy.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.248
He has three Michelin stars.

06:56.332 --> 07:01.128
<i>In San Pellegrino's</i>
<i>50 Best restaurants list,</i>

07:01.212 --> 07:04.549
<i>he's number three.</i>

07:04.632 --> 07:07.343
I hope to see him in the number one spot!

07:07.426 --> 07:09.971
...spoon tarts,
spaghetti with cream sauce,

07:10.054 --> 07:12.014
lobster bisque. March!

07:12.098 --> 07:13.140
March!

07:45.840 --> 07:48.968
<i>Today, he's an icon in Italy.</i>

07:50.595 --> 07:53.806
<i>But when he started,</i>
<i>the whole of Italy was against it.</i>

07:53.890 --> 07:55.642
It was a type of treason.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.520
<i>He was considered a traitor of Italy.</i>

11:08.876 --> 11:11.587
Can I drive the tractor?

11:11.671 --> 11:14.631
No, come on! I'm telling you.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.219
No, because it must be extraordinary.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.514
He's serious.
He wants to drive the tractor.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.684
No, no, I don't want to cause trouble.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.519
Does he have a tractor license?

11:27.603 --> 11:29.063
No, a wagon license.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.982
Yes, yes.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.255
Okay, Carlo, let's open it.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.016
Who wants to taste?

16:25.692 --> 16:27.028
Dear God!

16:33.742 --> 16:35.619
Here, taste some.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.775
Should I finish this dough?

18:29.858 --> 18:31.110
No, look, look.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.113
-I'll see if it's okay.
-It's good, isn't it?

18:34.196 --> 18:35.697
No, it's a little thick.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.741
A little more.

18:38.992 --> 18:42.496
Lidia, see if this one feels right.

18:43.914 --> 18:50.379
It's still, it's still...
yes, a little thick.

18:52.423 --> 18:55.842
Now, check if the dough is all right.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.346
You want to move this there?

18:59.430 --> 19:02.141
Yes, there is good.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.726
Okay, roll it a little more.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.651
It's a little uneven.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.571
You have to straighten it out.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.824
You know anyone can make it round?

19:18.907 --> 19:22.411
When you do it this way,
it doesn't come out as good.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.663
Who's going to start singing?

21:29.746 --> 21:31.164
Who's singing?

21:31.247 --> 21:32.583
Well, the tradition is...

21:32.666 --> 21:34.460
No, when you come the first...

21:34.543 --> 21:37.671
When you make tortellini for the first
time, you have to sing a song.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.130
Right, Lidia?

21:39.214 --> 21:40.716
I'll sing now.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.718
<i>That little bouquet of flowers</i>

21:42.801 --> 21:48.849
<i>That come from the mountains</i>

21:48.932 --> 21:55.856
<i>I want to give it to my sweetheart</i>
<i>when he comes tonight</i>

28:20.782 --> 28:25.996
I wanted to run from the kitchen.

28:49.644 --> 28:53.273
I wanted to, you know,
hara kiri, go like that.

29:44.615 --> 29:50.246
<i>That day I learned something.</i>

29:50.330 --> 29:54.542
That in life, to move forward...

29:54.625 --> 29:56.252
you learn from mistakes.

29:56.336 --> 30:02.633
Maybe I did something wrong,
but you learn from it.
