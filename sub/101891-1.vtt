44:21.606 --> 44:22.774
It's my husband's land.

44:22.809 --> 44:25.277
It's been in his family
for three generations.

44:25.310 --> 44:27.612
Well, not according to
the line management act.

44:28.613 --> 44:29.916
ANNE: What does that mean?

44:29.948 --> 44:31.517
It means it's out
of our jurisdiction.

44:31.617 --> 44:33.486
This isn't a federal office.

44:33.519 --> 44:36.522
It also means if we file
a missing persons report,

44:36.622 --> 44:38.524
it's gonna be questions about
your living arrangements.

44:38.624 --> 44:40.493
You know with your
little boy out there,

44:40.526 --> 44:42.463
is that something you
want to do right now?

44:43.664 --> 44:44.799
What about the wolf?

44:45.800 --> 44:47.334
If it happened near
town, it'd be different,

44:47.367 --> 44:50.538
but you can't really blame
a wolf for being a wolf,

44:50.638 --> 44:53.308
especially if he's doing
it where he's supposed to.

44:53.341 --> 44:55.610
Technically, he has more claim
to that area than she does.

44:55.643 --> 44:57.712
This isn't a normal wolf.

44:57.813 --> 45:00.449
I stood face to face with
it as close as we are now.

45:00.483 --> 45:02.618
Was it foaming, rabid?

45:02.651 --> 45:03.619
It wasn't rabid.

45:03.652 --> 45:04.987
It was.

45:08.324 --> 45:09.993

45:13.997 --> 45:14.966
It's not that.

45:14.998 --> 45:16.333
It's just.

45:16.666 --> 45:18.870
Like she said, we're
a municipal office.

45:18.903 --> 45:20.505
So there's nothing you'll do.

45:20.538 --> 45:21.506
What's to be done?

45:21.539 --> 45:23.040
Wolves are native to the area.

45:23.074 --> 45:24.008
My advice is to wait
for your husband

45:24.041 --> 45:25.309
to get back from his hunting

45:25.343 --> 45:26.979
and then move your
family out of the woods.

to cut through the skin
