01:52.512 --> 01:55.647
<i>The Second World War</i>
<i>was in its decisive phase.</i>

01:55.649 --> 01:59.685
<i>The Battle of Stalingrad</i>
<i>was crucial.</i>

01:59.687 --> 02:03.188
<i>The Germans had barricaded</i>
<i>themselves in</i>

02:03.190 --> 02:04.223
<i>all over the city.</i>

02:04.225 --> 02:05.424
<i>If they had taken Stalingrad,</i>

02:05.426 --> 02:08.227
<i>they would have taken control</i>
<i>the Russian oil fields,</i>

02:08.229 --> 02:11.663
<i>and Stalin would have</i>
<i>lost his advantage.</i>

02:11.665 --> 02:14.700
<i>So he put his sick genius mind</i>
<i>into action</i>

02:14.702 --> 02:17.169
<i>into winning the battle</i>
<i>at all costs.</i>

02:17.171 --> 02:22.374
<i>Over 2 million people died</i>
<i>during that battle.</i>

02:33.620 --> 02:38.257
[screaming]

02:42.862 --> 02:46.465
[screaming continues]

03:01.648 --> 03:07.386
[yelling in German]

03:20.767 --> 03:23.235
[screaming]

03:26.673 --> 03:29.274
[indistinct]

04:27.300 --> 04:30.002
[machine gun fire]

04:37.944 --> 04:41.380
[yells]

05:08.074 --> 05:11.076
[screaming]

05:54.754 --> 05:58.990
[whimpering]

07:15.868 --> 07:21.640
[man humming]

07:33.786 --> 07:37.956
[continues humming]

08:18.598 --> 08:21.233
- [gunfire]
- [screams]

08:47.793 --> 08:49.594
[flicks lighter]

08:49.929 --> 08:55.567
We have no account as to how
this man Hans survived.

08:58.971 --> 08:59.971
This is his diary.

08:59.973 --> 09:03.074
I got it from a friend of mine
I grew up with in Scotland,

09:03.076 --> 09:05.810
who's now with MI6.

09:05.812 --> 09:11.049
The last entry is August 1944.

09:11.051 --> 09:11.983
Couple of days later,

09:11.985 --> 09:16.888
he allegedly killed himself
in a German psych ward.

09:16.890 --> 09:21.026
- How is your German?
- Serviceable.

09:35.341 --> 09:39.911
Okay, so why do we give a shit
about some lunatic's journal?

09:39.913 --> 09:43.715
This is not some search
for the boogeyman, soldier.

09:43.717 --> 09:48.119
This is about
biochemical genocide.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.188
Exactly.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.276
[heavy breathing]

12:47.800 --> 12:50.068
[screeching]

12:56.208 --> 12:57.909
[growling]

12:57.911 --> 13:01.112
Stalin was always
one step ahead of Hitler,

13:01.114 --> 13:03.782
trying to create
a race of super warriors.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.885
Fortunately his experiments
were all destroyed

13:06.887 --> 13:08.486
before the end of the war.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.189
Some high-ranking officials
think the Russians

13:11.191 --> 13:16.127
stumbled upon something
much more sinister.

13:16.295 --> 13:20.098
- The gas in the story?
- Yes.

13:21.100 --> 13:21.966
You know,

13:21.968 --> 13:24.536
I learned a lot about the Battle
of Stalingrad in training,

13:24.538 --> 13:27.839
when they burned that city
halfway down to the ground.

13:27.841 --> 13:31.109
Never heard anything about
poisonous gas though.

13:31.111 --> 13:34.579
That's because forces
napalmed the south side.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.380
Burnt it all.

13:35.382 --> 13:41.085
It was the only way
to control the infection.

13:43.956 --> 13:46.024
[growling]

14:09.148 --> 14:12.383
[growling]

14:21.894 --> 14:28.032
[heavy breathing]

14:35.574 --> 14:40.078
That's funny, sir. Is that
the new official ghost story

14:40.080 --> 14:42.413
to scare the recruits?

14:42.415 --> 14:43.047
I wish.

14:43.049 --> 14:46.150
Very few people
knew about the gas.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.920
They destroyed
all records of it.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.890
Nobody wanted to admit
any atrocities occurred.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.225
So there's no evidence of this.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.929
[scoffs]
You're holding the evidence.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.998
That's all we ever got.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.468
Why are you telling me
about this big secret now?

15:03.470 --> 15:08.239
The last 24 hours,
reports come out of Bulgaria

15:08.241 --> 15:10.408
reporting an incident
that matches

15:10.410 --> 15:14.212
what's written about
in that diary.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.048
There's a base.

15:17.050 --> 15:20.051
On the base,
there's a munitions warehouse.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.053
This warehouse goes
8 floors deep

15:22.055 --> 15:24.555
and holds 80 years' worth
of weapons.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.691
With the Russians
and Bulgarians alliance

15:26.693 --> 15:27.992
after the Second World War,

15:27.994 --> 15:30.194
we think there's a good chance
that that gas

15:30.196 --> 15:31.963
is somewhere inside
that warehouse.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.565
So have one of our contacts
check it out.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.001
[chuckles]
We don't think the Bulgarians

15:37.003 --> 15:39.637
have any idea
what they are sitting on.

15:39.639 --> 15:44.142
We need to find it,
secure it at any cost.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.144
So how are you getting me in?

15:46.146 --> 15:47.679
<i>There have been a string</i>
<i>of arms thefts</i>

15:47.681 --> 15:51.616
<i>at several military bases</i>
<i>throughout Eastern Europe.</i>

15:51.618 --> 15:56.054
<i>Your cover will be as</i>
<i>Captain John McGahey,</i>

15:56.056 --> 15:57.055
<i>arsenal inspector.</i>

15:57.057 --> 16:00.224
<i>You'll be investigating</i>
<i>a robbery in the warehouse</i>

16:00.226 --> 16:02.026
<i>at the same base.</i>

16:02.028 --> 16:04.595
<i>Your job is to get into</i>
<i>this warehouse</i>

16:04.597 --> 16:07.966
<i>and report back</i>
<i>anything you find.</i>

16:07.968 --> 16:13.471
<i>Your contact will be</i>
<i>military doctor Ana Bennett.</i>

16:19.044 --> 16:21.279
<i>Anything with this insignia,</i>

16:21.281 --> 16:26.317
<i>you report back to me</i>
<i>and only me.</i>

16:35.361 --> 16:37.195
Captain John McGahey.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.330
- At ease, sir.
- Welcome to Bulgaria, sir.

16:39.332 --> 16:44.235
Pvt. Harold Miller at your
service. Let me take your bag.

16:44.770 --> 16:45.703
How long is the drive?

16:45.705 --> 16:47.772
- It's a couple hours, sir.
- Perfect.

16:47.774 --> 16:52.310
- Wake me up when we get close.
- Yes, sir.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.125
Most of the locals here
work for the base.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.760
It's the biggest employer.

17:42.762 --> 17:47.098
Yeah, looks like
they're thriving.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.769
Don't worry, private.
We were all young once.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.471
We have an hour for lunch
before we're meeting

17:53.473 --> 17:55.106
with the Bulgarian
commander Borov.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.642
I can have it brought
to your room or--

17:57.644 --> 18:00.478
I'll be skipping lunch.

18:00.512 --> 18:03.414
I need you to take me
to this address.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.652
Sir, I don't have
authorization to--

18:07.654 --> 18:11.422
- I just gave you authorization.
- Yes, sir.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.893
- Who let you in?
- Oh, hi.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.195
- We're here from--
- Don't sass me!

18:51.197 --> 18:55.833
You and your rowdy friends
better get out of here

18:55.835 --> 18:58.669
before I call Virgil!

18:58.671 --> 19:01.405
We'll only be a second, ma'am.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.508
Charming woman.

19:12.351 --> 19:13.818
Yes?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.419
Hi. Is Dr. Bennett here?

19:15.421 --> 19:18.523
Mommy told me not to
talk to strangers.

19:18.525 --> 19:23.361
Oh, uh, my name is John.
What's yours?

19:26.331 --> 19:26.898
Miriam.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.734
Hi, Miriam. See?
Now we're not strangers.

19:29.736 --> 19:30.935
Is your mommy home?

19:30.937 --> 19:32.603
She's asleep.

19:32.605 --> 19:36.541
Oh. I have some really important
questions to ask her.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.943
You think we come in
for a bit?

19:38.945 --> 19:42.880
Mommy told me not to let
strangers inside.

19:42.882 --> 19:43.814
That's a really good rule.

19:43.816 --> 19:49.587
How about you go get your mommy,
and we will wait here?

19:50.355 --> 19:53.357
Maybe you should come inside.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.360
My Aunt Koina
might try to get you.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.863
Sounds good.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.965
You look pretty.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.202
I made you coffee.

20:05.737 --> 20:06.604
Can I help you?

20:06.606 --> 20:07.939
Hi. I'm Captain John McGahey.

20:07.941 --> 20:10.975
I'm here regarding
that report you filed.

20:10.977 --> 20:14.879
Would you like
coffee or milk?

20:14.881 --> 20:15.913
No, thank you, sweetie.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.883
Is there someplace a little bit
more private we can speak?

20:18.885 --> 20:22.520
Mm-hmm.
We can talk through there.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.688
Great.

20:23.690 --> 20:24.522
Hey, Miriam,

20:24.524 --> 20:28.960
would you mind showing Pvt.
Miller here some of your toys?

20:30.329 --> 20:31.229
Sure.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.431
Thank you.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.935
Okay, who do you got here?

20:37.937 --> 20:40.905
This is Mr. Bunny.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.778
So I was looking over
your file and, uh,

20:47.780 --> 20:49.847
is it true you were
put on temporary leave?

20:49.849 --> 20:52.817
More like
indefinite suspension.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.385
Who suspended you?

20:54.387 --> 20:56.887
Bulgarian commanding officer,
Colonel Borov.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.757
He claimed my report
was grossly negligent,

20:59.759 --> 21:03.461
and I was liable
for what happened.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.997
What did happen?

21:05.999 --> 21:09.600
You won't believe me
if I told you.

21:10.569 --> 21:11.469
Trust me.

21:11.471 --> 21:16.674
If nobody believed you,
they wouldn't have sent me.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.376
I was on duty last week.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.545
And lift up.

21:21.547 --> 21:25.349
Thank you, private.
You can get dressed now.

21:26.018 --> 21:26.817
[coughs]

21:26.819 --> 21:30.554
- We might be able to save it.
- Might?

21:30.556 --> 21:35.293
You can start by
staying away from brothels.

21:35.295 --> 21:39.363
Dr. Bennett,
chemical emergency!

21:41.033 --> 21:41.999
So what have we got?

21:42.001 --> 21:44.869
They say a stack of barrels
in the munitions warehouse

21:44.871 --> 21:45.870
collapsed on him.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.906
Punctured lungs,
a few broken bones in his face.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.809
He was down on minus eight.

21:51.811 --> 21:56.314
[steady beeping]

21:56.316 --> 21:59.717
Dr. Bennett, he's gone.

22:03.522 --> 22:06.023
He's brain dead.
His heart stopped.

22:06.025 --> 22:11.395
The respirator is the only thing
that's keeping him alive.

22:11.430 --> 22:15.666
Time of death, 6:05 p.m.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.762
And the next thing I saw

22:44.764 --> 22:49.433
was him standing up
and attacking my nurse.

22:49.901 --> 22:51.469
[growls]

22:51.471 --> 22:56.707
[screaming]

23:19.731 --> 23:21.098
What happened to the body?

23:21.100 --> 23:23.801
- I heard they cremated it.
- Great.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.437
Colonel Borov said
he'd take care of the report.

23:26.439 --> 23:29.006
He wrote that the patient
was hallucinating

23:29.008 --> 23:31.842
and wanted me to sign off on it.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.144
It's bullshit.

23:33.146 --> 23:34.545
It wasn't drugs.

23:34.547 --> 23:37.581
The patient went ballistic
after he was dead.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.917
I insisted on revising it.

23:39.919 --> 23:43.487
He got furious,
accused me of being incompetent

23:43.489 --> 23:45.790
and responsible for both deaths,

23:45.792 --> 23:47.158
then suspended me.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.693
That's when I sent in
my complaint.

23:49.695 --> 23:51.996
Is there any evidence
of this?

23:51.998 --> 23:53.831
Photos, videos, anything?

23:53.833 --> 23:57.935
Whatever we had
was confiscated by Borov.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.837
What caused this?

23:59.839 --> 24:03.607
A biochemical substance
we believe is here on-site.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.877
Now what floor did you say
your patient was injured on?

24:06.879 --> 24:10.614
Lowest floor, level 8.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.552
With the U.S. taking over,

24:14.554 --> 24:18.956
most of the major duties
are split between both armies.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.225
How's that working out?

24:21.227 --> 24:23.461
Good.

24:23.463 --> 24:23.928
Really?

24:23.930 --> 24:26.997
Well, Bulgarians are upset
about losing control.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.966
And the Americans hate
that the Bulgarians

24:28.968 --> 24:31.569
are slowing down
the transition so much.

24:31.571 --> 24:35.639
Sounds like
one big happy family.

25:05.036 --> 25:05.769
Colonel.

25:05.771 --> 25:08.672
Welcome to Bulgaria,
Captain McGahey.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.242
Thank you, Colonel.

25:12.077 --> 25:19.016
Bulgarian army has always been
respected throughout the world.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.653
It is a shame they are giving
this base over to foreigners.

25:22.655 --> 25:26.857
Maybe the Americans boys will
teach you guys a thing or two.

25:26.859 --> 25:30.227
[shouts in Bulgarian]

25:30.662 --> 25:33.297
Colonel, I'm gonna need access
to all your warehouses

25:33.299 --> 25:36.667
and munitions'
storage facilities.

25:36.669 --> 25:37.701
I'm sorry, Captain.

25:37.703 --> 25:42.172
Those warehouses are only opened
in the event of war.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.241
Why would such a respected army
want to fight

25:44.243 --> 25:46.810
with weapons from World War II?

25:46.812 --> 25:49.013
With the string of robberies
you've been having

25:49.015 --> 25:52.650
in the past year,
the international authorities

25:52.652 --> 25:55.052
would like a more updated record
of your inventory.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.955
And since the base will be
turned over to Major Stone soon,

25:57.957 --> 26:00.691
that shouldn't be a problem,
should it, Colonel?

26:00.693 --> 26:04.328
The base, yes,
but not the warehouses.

26:04.330 --> 26:07.731
Those will still be
in my responsibility.

26:07.733 --> 26:11.569
Listen, Colonel, if you want
to keep your position here,

26:11.571 --> 26:14.038
I suggest you find a way
to make this happen,

26:14.040 --> 26:16.840
otherwise you may be
replaced a little bit sooner

26:16.842 --> 26:20.277
than you expect,
do you understand?

26:24.249 --> 26:26.650
Have a nice day.

26:32.724 --> 26:35.926
What does he want?

26:35.928 --> 26:38.295
To be a pain.

26:39.064 --> 26:42.967
Tell Vladi we need to meet.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.035
Understood.

27:00.885 --> 27:03.253
[children laugh]

27:21.673 --> 27:24.842
Thought you could sneak by me?

27:24.844 --> 27:27.945
You little brat!

27:39.257 --> 27:41.725
There you go.

27:43.762 --> 27:45.095
- Mom.
- Mm-hmm?

27:45.097 --> 27:47.064
I don't even like that cheese.

27:47.066 --> 27:50.801
Well, you know what
shopping's like on this island.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.737
I hate this island.

27:53.905 --> 27:57.775
So how was your
school carnival today?

27:57.777 --> 28:00.110
I don't want
to go anymore.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.246
Why not?

28:02.248 --> 28:05.416
They make fun of me.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.786
Because you're
smarter and prettier

28:08.788 --> 28:10.788
than all the other kids?

28:10.790 --> 28:12.956
No. 'Cause I'm American.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.124
They hate us.

28:14.126 --> 28:17.961
Not everybody hates Americans.

28:17.963 --> 28:22.299
They fired you for no reason.

28:24.736 --> 28:27.171
Sweetie...

28:27.173 --> 28:29.106
come here.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.474
You don't need to worry.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.476
Mommy's just taking
a little break.

28:32.478 --> 28:37.081
And next year you're gonna have
loads more American friends,

28:37.083 --> 28:41.719
and you are gonna have
a much better time.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.921
Can I stay home till then?

28:43.923 --> 28:44.922
No.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.224
But you can practice
your Bulgarian

28:47.226 --> 28:50.260
and make lots of new friends.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.729
I'll never be friends with Ivan.

28:51.731 --> 28:55.265
You don't have to. You can be
friends with everybody else.

28:55.267 --> 28:59.103
And then Ivan
will leave you alone.

I'll meet her later.

We're gonna take a little break.

Is this because of that
contaminated soldier?

30:23.489 --> 30:27.024
I don't know
what are you talking about.

30:27.026 --> 30:30.594
Hey, Colonel,
if they're sending an American

30:30.596 --> 30:32.462
to investigate
your little accident,

30:32.464 --> 30:36.433
you better believe
Vladi knows about it, huh?

30:36.435 --> 30:41.238
Okay, okay, so two
or three weeks delay?

30:41.240 --> 30:42.105
No.

30:42.107 --> 30:45.309
We're done for good.

30:45.311 --> 30:47.945
Done?

30:47.947 --> 30:50.147
Done done?

30:50.149 --> 30:53.317
No, no, I have customers.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.118
They have already paid.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.888
They are waiting on shipments.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.991
They're gonna be pissed.

31:03.261 --> 31:05.062
Pissed?

31:05.064 --> 31:09.399
If this American finds
hundreds of weapons are gone,

31:09.401 --> 31:12.903
you'll spend the rest
of your life in jail.

31:12.905 --> 31:17.474
No. There's got to be
another way.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.577
I've made you a very rich man.

31:20.579 --> 31:25.482
Shut it down
and find another hobby.

31:27.252 --> 31:31.021
Now bring me that brunette.

31:55.179 --> 31:57.681
Here for little pleasure?

31:57.683 --> 32:01.418
- No, Colonel.
- Is everything set?

32:01.420 --> 32:04.521
Yes. I've got the detonators.

32:04.523 --> 32:08.625
Gochev and Dimov
are on duty now.

32:08.627 --> 32:12.329
Good. Now, what is this

32:12.331 --> 32:19.236
about your wife and child
trying to leave town, hmm?

32:19.238 --> 32:22.072
Are you an idiot or what?

32:22.074 --> 32:26.043
Why don't you just tell
the American you are in this?

32:26.045 --> 32:29.613
Who knows what contaminated
weapons are down there.

32:29.615 --> 32:33.383
I can't let my wife,
my daughter--

32:33.385 --> 32:35.319
Shh.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.420
Relax.

32:36.422 --> 32:44.428

all our problems vanish.

32:45.663 --> 32:48.665
You saw what happened to Yanko.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.100
Hmm?

32:50.102 --> 32:54.471
Whatever infected him
is in that warehouse.

That's just an STD.
His girlfriend's a slut.

as you ordered,

33:09.288 --> 33:11.989

33:11.991 --> 33:13.724

35:05.137 --> 35:07.170

No, I haven't, but I promise
I'll help you look.

Dr. Bennett, breathe. Slower.

41:48.139 --> 41:51.007

She just completely--

41:51.009 --> 41:52.542
- Dr. Bennett!
- She's out of here--

41:52.544 --> 41:54.577
Dr. Bennett, we're gonna
find her. Don't worry.

- But how do you know?
- I know.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.814
Listen to me. There are
two entrances to the bunker.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.583
- One's there, one's over there.
- She could be locked outside!

42:00.585 --> 42:02.018
- She isn't!
- But she might be!

42:02.020 --> 42:05.054

leave a child outside

but it won't stop bleeding.

49:54.492 --> 49:57.259
- I'm going to find my daughter!
- No, you're not! Stay here!

49:57.261 --> 49:58.194
Get off of me, Harold!

49:58.196 --> 50:00.696
That's suicide,
and you know that!

50:00.698 --> 50:02.999
If she is out there,
I will find her!

50:03.001 --> 50:06.135
You know the odds.

50:08.472 --> 50:11.774
Okay, but I guess
I'm coming with you.

50:11.776 --> 50:13.776
I want to stay with you.

50:13.778 --> 50:15.678
- Are you sure?
- We'll be safer with you.

50:15.680 --> 50:20.216
- What do you think?
- Okay, so let's go!

50:45.742 --> 50:50.346
[distant gunfire]

50:55.185 --> 50:55.651
[crash]

50:55.653 --> 50:58.187
Hey, Miriam, is that you?

50:58.189 --> 50:59.588
Hey, don't be scared.

50:59.590 --> 51:01.123
I'm your friend, remember?

51:01.125 --> 51:02.792
Look, it's me.
It's John.

51:02.794 --> 51:05.828
I'm your friend, remember?
Can you help me?

51:05.830 --> 51:07.696
Are-- Are you a criminal?

51:07.698 --> 51:10.366
No, no, no.
No, I am your friend.

51:10.368 --> 51:12.802
Look, I need you
to help me out, okay?

51:12.804 --> 51:15.604
Then why did they lock you up?

51:15.606 --> 51:18.707
Some mean people
were picking on me.

51:18.709 --> 51:20.242
Ivan picks on me, too.

51:20.244 --> 51:21.377
I know Ivan picks on you.

51:21.379 --> 51:23.379
Find the policeman.
He has the keys to this door.

51:23.381 --> 51:26.649
I need you to find him and
get them to unlock the door.

51:26.651 --> 51:28.551
Hurry up.

51:32.522 --> 51:34.256
No, I don't want to.

51:34.258 --> 51:35.257
You're a big girl now.

51:35.259 --> 51:36.692
If you find the keys
and get me out of here,

51:36.694 --> 51:38.727
I can protect you
from all the bad guys

51:38.729 --> 51:39.829
who were chasing you, okay?

51:39.831 --> 51:43.866
You need to do it fast.
I need you to hurry.

51:43.868 --> 51:45.468
Go on. Come on.

51:45.470 --> 51:49.371
Come on, sweetie.
You can do it. Hurry up.

51:54.744 --> 51:58.614
Did you find him yet?
Miriam?

52:20.203 --> 52:22.271
Stand back!

52:48.431 --> 52:51.667
[growls]

52:52.736 --> 52:54.904
[gunshot]

53:01.945 --> 53:04.647
Come on, sweetie.

53:08.185 --> 53:09.318
You killed the bad guys?

53:09.320 --> 53:11.420
Yeah. You and your rabbit
are safe.

53:11.422 --> 53:14.256
His name is Mr. Bunny.

53:14.591 --> 53:18.227
So why are you out here
all alone?

53:18.229 --> 53:19.361
Where's your mom?

53:19.363 --> 53:21.263
I lost her on the way
to the bunker.

53:21.265 --> 53:22.765
Hey, don't cry.
Listen to me.

53:22.767 --> 53:25.868
I'm gonna get you back
to your mom, okay?

53:25.870 --> 53:28.704
I promise.

53:28.706 --> 53:30.573
Let's go.

53:44.821 --> 53:47.223
[horn honks]

54:01.805 --> 54:02.938
Soldier, open the barrier!

54:02.940 --> 54:05.274
- Sorry, sir, we can't.
- Do you know who I am?

54:05.276 --> 54:08.510
Yes, Colonel Borov, but we
have strict orders not to.

54:08.512 --> 54:10.746
I'm the one who issued
that order!

54:10.748 --> 54:13.649
- Let me through, soldier!
- Yes, sir!

54:13.651 --> 54:17.319
Please! Take my baby!
Save him!

54:17.321 --> 54:20.456
Get back! Get back!

54:54.924 --> 54:59.962
So is this what Captain McGahey
talked to you about?

55:00.463 --> 55:00.963
Yeah.

55:00.965 --> 55:02.298
And what did he tell you?

55:02.300 --> 55:05.334
He said that there were
some unstable weapons

55:05.336 --> 55:06.335
in the warehouses.

55:06.337 --> 55:10.906
He was investigating it.
He didn't tell me much.

55:14.544 --> 55:17.579
Go straight down,
turn right!

55:17.947 --> 55:21.317
They're not dying!

55:32.362 --> 55:33.829
Boss! Boss!

55:33.831 --> 55:36.532
Take it easy, you sluts!

55:37.467 --> 55:40.402
Who did this?

55:43.707 --> 55:45.507
Anton, this is Italian leather!

55:45.509 --> 55:47.976
Bring her to the bathroom,
clean her up!

55:47.978 --> 55:52.381
I will take care of this punk!

55:52.482 --> 55:55.617
Nobody touches my girls!

55:56.086 --> 55:58.620
Ohh...

56:33.957 --> 56:36.525
[screams]

56:45.034 --> 56:47.936
Fucking kook!

56:52.008 --> 56:56.011
Man, I just saw
the most fucked-up thing!

57:00.950 --> 57:03.919
She's dead.

57:06.022 --> 57:08.157
[knocking]

57:10.627 --> 57:12.528
[knocking]

57:12.530 --> 57:16.999
I thought you said
she was dead.

57:23.840 --> 57:27.009
[growling]

58:07.016 --> 58:11.253
[dialing]

58:11.255 --> 58:13.956
[line ringing]

58:14.958 --> 58:18.060
Borov, what the hell
is going on?

58:18.062 --> 58:19.695
<i>[indistinct dialogue]</i>

58:19.697 --> 58:22.731
I just had craziest thing
ever happened.

58:22.733 --> 58:26.201
The whole town
is going to shit!

58:27.136 --> 58:29.238
Mainland? Why?

58:29.839 --> 58:33.909
Code red?
Borov, why didn't you tell me?

58:33.911 --> 58:36.578
What is code red?

58:49.893 --> 58:51.960
[screaming]

59:21.090 --> 59:22.291
Miriam?

59:22.293 --> 59:23.926
Baby?

59:23.928 --> 59:26.562
Sweetheart?

59:31.200 --> 59:33.001
She's been here.

59:33.003 --> 59:35.871
We gotta leave now.

59:35.873 --> 59:39.207
No. We have to look around.

59:39.209 --> 59:43.312
Those footprints,
they're not hers.

59:43.314 --> 59:47.115
[fire crackling]

59:52.288 --> 59:53.956
What are those?

59:53.958 --> 59:55.657
Those are my dog tags.

59:55.659 --> 59:57.759
[chuckles]
You're not a dog.

59:57.761 --> 01:00:01.663
Soldiers wear these, too.
These were my dad's.

01:00:01.665 --> 01:00:04.099
- This is my school.
- Oh, yeah?

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.801
Do you have any kids?

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:08.270
A little girl just like you.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.172
What's her name?

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:11.974
Olivia.

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:13.709
Where is she?

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:16.178
She's in heaven right now
with her mommy.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.047
- [screeching]
- Get down!

01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:15.003
Miss Sarac?

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:18.707
Miss Sarac?

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:40.462
[screaming]

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:11.059
- [whimpering]
- Hey, Miriam, Miriam.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:14.362
Come here to me.
It's okay, sweetie. Come on.

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:16.865
Come here. Okay.

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:21.002
- [sobbing]
- Shh...

01:02:21.004 --> 01:02:22.738
Oh, I got you.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:28.009
I got you. You're okay.
They're gone, they're gone.

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:34.082
Hey, look who I got.
Mr. Bunny.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.518
Here you go, baby.

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.789
Let's go.

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:56.438
- Look!
- Hey!

01:02:58.241 --> 01:02:59.875
We're saved!

01:02:59.877 --> 01:03:02.477
- Hey!
- No! Villi! Dimo! Stop!

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:04.546
[gunfire]

01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:06.481
No!

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:09.384
Get in! Get in!

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:11.419
It's a code red.

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:46.047
[gunfire]

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:25.520
Miriam, come on.

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:31.126
Up here.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:41.269
Here. Get down.
Get down.

01:05:47.476 --> 01:05:50.145
Down, down, down.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:05.694
They cremating people?

01:06:05.696 --> 01:06:08.129
No, sweetie.

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:10.065
Down, down.

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:14.002
I think they're staring
to move away.

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:16.571
It's okay.

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:24.045
Miriam...

01:06:24.047 --> 01:06:26.114
Don't cry, okay?

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:29.084
All right?

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:32.620
How's Mr. Bunny doing?

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:36.224
Is he doing all right?
Is he scared?

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:37.592
A bit.

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:40.662
You'll see your mommy soon.

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:42.030
Okay?

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:46.101
Smile. It's okay.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.437
We're pretty close
to the bunker.

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:53.241
You can rest when you see
your mommy. How about that?

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:56.277
Five more minutes?

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:02.117
John?

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:03.184
Yeah?

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.185
I'm hungry.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:06.688
All right, sweetie.
Let's get you some grub.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:10.392
- Eww.
- [chuckles]

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.062
[banging]

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:16.531
Miriam... hang on!

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:29.477
Freeze! On your knees!

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:31.513
- There's infected coming!
- [gunfire]

01:07:31.515 --> 01:07:33.314
On your knees or we'll shoot!

01:07:33.316 --> 01:07:36.751
I said there's infected coming!

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:40.155
Come on! Get down!

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:27.335
We're clean. Let us in.

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:28.870
We're not allowed
to take anyone.

01:08:28.872 --> 01:08:30.238
Come on.
You know you can do it.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.541
We can't take anyone alive.

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:37.745
- At least take the child.
- No!

01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:41.416
Miriam, it's okay.
Look, you'll be safe with them.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:44.652
No! I wanna stay with you.
Please!

01:08:44.654 --> 01:08:49.524
A code red is in effect.
We're giving you a privilege.

01:08:49.526 --> 01:08:51.693
A privilege? Take the girl.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.629
A privilege
that won't last long.

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:58.332
Move along while you
still have the chance.

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:02.770
Come on, Miriam.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:12.346
It's okay.

01:09:33.368 --> 01:09:36.437
[engine failing]

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:38.473
Shit.

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:43.310
[sighs]

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:46.613
Ana, that's it.

01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:48.515
We have to head
to the bridge now.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:51.352
- We've got to keep on going.
- Ana, I'm sorry!

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.188
The chances
of a small child surviving

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.724
in these circumstances
for this long are not good.

01:09:56.726 --> 01:10:01.296
If she's out there,
I'm gonna find her.

01:10:01.298 --> 01:10:03.298
Where--

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:08.336
Where are you going?
Where are you gonna go?

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:09.837
I don't know!

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:12.907
- Stop!
- Get off me!

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:13.975
Listen to me!

01:10:13.977 --> 01:10:16.344
Miriam's a smart kid.
Think about it.

01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:18.580
If she's out there,
I'm sure she's with someone

01:10:18.582 --> 01:10:22.750
who's taking her
to the goddamn bridge.

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:27.555
Okay? It's her best option.

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:31.292
We gotta go.

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:35.363
- And we gotta go now.
- Okay.

01:10:48.844 --> 01:10:53.982
If anyone tries to cross,
shoot without warning.

01:10:53.984 --> 01:10:56.751
We've lost contact
with two more patrols,

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:59.320
and another patrol
ran out of gas.

01:10:59.322 --> 01:11:01.923
Most of their men
were killed by--

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:04.726
Shut down every grid,
Lieutenant.

01:11:04.728 --> 01:11:05.994
Code 227.

01:11:05.996 --> 01:11:09.497
Nobody can leave the town.
Put the planes on alert.

01:11:09.499 --> 01:11:11.766
We'll strike
at first sunlight.

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:16.871
But this code was used last
during the Second World War.

01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:18.306
Sorry?

01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:20.608
Yes, sir!

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:38.693
We need backup.

01:11:38.695 --> 01:11:42.330
I repeat, we need backup!

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:45.400
Down, Miriam.

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:46.668
Shh! Okay.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:49.737
Miriam, we're gonna play
a little game, all right?

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:50.605
What game?

01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:54.842
I need you to close your eyes
and count to ten real slow.

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:56.978
- Okay? Can you do that for me.
- Yeah, okay.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.714
Whatever you do,
whatever you hear,

01:11:59.716 --> 01:12:03.718
no matter what,
don't peek, okay?

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.887
Go.

01:12:05.889 --> 01:12:09.057
One...

01:12:09.059 --> 01:12:11.426
two...

01:12:11.428 --> 01:12:13.428
three...

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:19.667
four...

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:36.117
Please...
I have two small kids.

01:12:36.119 --> 01:12:38.986
But you're fine with
shooting and burning

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:41.956
other people's children, right?

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:45.126
Here's your privilege.

01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:46.060
Die human.

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:49.397
- [gunshot]
- ...ten.

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:52.934
Good job, sweetie.

01:12:52.936 --> 01:12:56.437
Good job.
Come on, let's go.

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:15.056
- What's your name?
- Alex, sir.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:17.158
Take us to the bridge
and live, Alex.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.026
Watch your head, Miriam.

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:22.163
- Got her?
- Yup.

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:34.041
Drive! Move this thing.

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:41.549
Relax, Alex.
I'm American special forces.

01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:43.918
I need you to take the girl
and me to the bridge.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.821
- Can you do that?
- Of course.

01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:48.823
But we are running out of gas.

01:13:48.825 --> 01:13:50.825
We can drive less than a mile.

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:55.496
We have to go
to a gas station.

01:13:55.498 --> 01:13:58.566
Well, find one.

01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:02.904
You cold, sweetie?

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:10.678
There you go. All right. Shh.
Don't think about it.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.046
Back to sleep.

01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:14.649
Shh.

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:24.692
- Harold?
- Yeah.

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:26.994
We need to take some water.

01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:31.098
Then we've gotta
carry on moving.

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:42.610
I'm gonna go through the door
on the right.

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:44.745
Clear.

01:14:44.747 --> 01:14:47.715
All right, I'll cover you.

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:52.920
[gate rattles]

01:14:52.922 --> 01:14:55.089
Locked.

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:12.507
[laughs]

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:14.976
Come on.

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:23.885
Thank you, God!

01:15:23.887 --> 01:15:26.854
Can you get us
close to the pump?

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:30.591
Uh, no, this is it.

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:35.162
All right.

01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:38.232
Miriam, wait here.

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:04.859
You're kidding me.
It's too short.

01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:09.664
Go inside. Find something
to put gas in it.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.651
Drop it.

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:33.220
Don't even think to shout.

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:35.189
Move.

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:37.258
Move!

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:48.102
Put down your weapon!
Now! Do it!

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:52.340
Don't make me ask you again!

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:57.078
Mommy? Mommy!

01:16:57.813 --> 01:17:01.148
- Dr. Bennett?
- Miriam?

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:02.683
Mommy!

01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:05.052
- Thank you. Thank you so much!
- Mommy!

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:08.122
- John saved me.
- Good to see you again, John.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:09.624
Harold, get in there!

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:11.258
Find something
to put this gas in now!

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:13.728
Double time! Move it!

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:16.864
- Mommy!
- My sweet peanut!

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:18.099
- Oh, baby!
- Mommy!

01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:21.068
I thought I'd lost you.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:25.206
Thank you so much
for saving her.

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:32.213
Let's go! Come on!

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:34.682
You two, come on!

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:40.855
Come on, guys, hurry up!

01:17:40.857 --> 01:17:43.991
Let's go, move!

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:47.962
One in the warehouse.
I'll go and get it.

01:17:47.964 --> 01:17:48.763
Make it quick.

01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:52.299
- I'm on it.
- Hurry up.

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:59.040
Harold, come on!

01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:02.376
[growling]

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:04.011
Get down!

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.180
[growling]

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:34.075
John?

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:40.181
John?

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:45.720
Go on.

01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:47.455
Get out of here.
Go without me. I'm done.

01:18:47.457 --> 01:18:50.991
Alex, get them out of here!

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:54.195
- John?
- You need to go.

01:18:54.197 --> 01:18:56.497
- Let me see!
- No!

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:57.965
Stay up there.
It's too late.

01:18:57.967 --> 01:19:00.468
- Come with us!
- No, I can't, sweetie.

01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:02.369
- You need to go now.
- Please!

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:05.506
Ana, put her in there. I don't
want her to see me like this.

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:08.075
- Wait for me inside.
- No! John!

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:12.213
- Baby, listen--
- Come with us!

01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:14.248
Give her these.

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:16.517
And, Ana...

01:19:16.519 --> 01:19:21.255
don't let me leave the world
like one of these things.

01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:24.125
Please.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:38.472
[gunfire]

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:22.276
That was it.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:25.579
We can't go any further.

01:21:25.581 --> 01:21:28.115
Peanut...

01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:30.651
I love you.

01:21:30.653 --> 01:21:33.053
I love you, Mommy.

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:37.191
I love you, I love you.

01:21:37.193 --> 01:21:39.093
Okay, we're gonna
have to get out,

01:21:39.095 --> 01:21:43.430
and you need
to stay by my side.

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:46.000
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:07.321
I'm Dr. Ana Bennett!

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:12.927
In charge of the biochemical
division on base!

01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:16.931
I'm aware of the infection!

01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:20.000
I know what caused it!

01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:22.937
What should we do?

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:28.409
Code red is in effect.
No one can be released.

01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:29.576
No.

01:22:29.578 --> 01:22:32.012
I want her brought in alive.

01:22:32.014 --> 01:22:33.280
Who the hell are you?

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:36.083
U.S. General Kenneth Owens.

01:22:36.085 --> 01:22:40.187
You have no clue what
you're dealing with here.

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:43.057
I'm in charge now.

01:22:43.059 --> 01:22:46.160
Bring her in!

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:51.365
Baby, come on.

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:56.136
Come.

01:22:56.138 --> 01:23:00.040
Good girl.
Don't look down.

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:02.276
Come on.

01:23:02.278 --> 01:23:03.677
Alex?

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:06.981
No, I don't wanna die.

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:31.472
- Mr. Bunny! Mr. Bunny!
- Shh! Baby!

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:34.775
[screaming]

01:23:34.777 --> 01:23:38.045
It's okay! Shh!

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:47.154
- [whimpering]
- Shh...

01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:55.295
[gunfire]

01:23:58.099 --> 01:23:58.766
[screaming]

01:23:58.768 --> 01:24:05.139
Something cut my hand!
Something cut my hand!

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:09.643
Something cut my hand!
