00:02.836 --> 00:04.805
- (camera clicks)
- (chuckling)

00:04.905 --> 00:06.407
(laughs):
Okay.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.078
Carly, it means so much to me
that you agreed

00:10.178 --> 00:11.645
to go to my hospital prom.

00:12.946 --> 00:16.384
I'm honored. I've never been
to a prom at a hospital before.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.552
But is it cool if I sneak away
at some point

00:18.652 --> 00:21.055
and have a doctor look
at my jacked-up elbows?

00:21.155 --> 00:23.091
Hey, guys, we should
probably hit the road,

00:23.191 --> 00:26.527
but I'm having trouble finding
the hospital on my GPS.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.896
Yeah, it's not coming up
on my phone, either.

00:28.996 --> 00:31.365
(laughing)

00:31.465 --> 00:33.601
I can't believe you fell for it.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.637
Fell for what?

00:36.737 --> 00:39.807
You've been pranked
by the Prank Prince!

00:39.907 --> 00:42.410
There's cameras everywhere.
(laughs)

00:42.510 --> 00:44.512
Excuse me, Carly.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.581
So, we're not going to
Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.783
That's the hospital
from Grey's Anatomy!

00:49.883 --> 00:52.253
Durf. (laughs)

00:52.353 --> 00:54.122
So this is what you do?

00:54.222 --> 00:57.325
You manipulate nice people
into doing nice things,

00:57.425 --> 00:58.892
and then you make fun of them?

00:58.992 --> 01:00.761
Yarp. It's hilarious.

01:00.861 --> 01:03.631
Oh, man, I'm glad you're not
one of those girls

01:03.731 --> 01:06.567
that gets angry at stuff.
Ugh, those are the worst!

01:07.168 --> 01:08.702
Why would I be angry?

01:08.802 --> 01:13.341
Now I have a $700
hot pink satin dress

01:13.441 --> 01:15.343
I'm never gonna wear again.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.010
Prank selfie.

01:17.111 --> 01:19.447
Say "hilarious." Pffft!

01:19.547 --> 01:22.283
(weakly):
Hilarious. Yay.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.584
(camera clicks)

01:23.684 --> 01:25.119
* I know *

01:25.219 --> 01:26.754
* You see *

01:26.854 --> 01:28.922
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

01:29.022 --> 01:31.992
* And be so wonderful *

01:32.092 --> 01:35.763
* So wake up
the members of my nation *

01:35.863 --> 01:37.965
* It's your time to be *

01:38.065 --> 01:41.001
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

01:41.101 --> 01:43.704
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

01:43.804 --> 01:46.974
* Of every situation *

01:47.074 --> 01:48.942
* Some things are meant to be *

01:49.042 --> 01:52.546
* So give your best
and leave the rest to me. *

01:56.550 --> 01:58.552
I cannot believe
what that fool did to you.

01:58.652 --> 02:02.356
Oh, the prom fake-out?
Yeah, isn't it hilarious?

02:02.456 --> 02:05.159
No, it's infuriating.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.760
Immediately after I watched it,

02:06.860 --> 02:09.263
I created a fake online profile
so we could catfish him.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.964
(laughs)

02:11.064 --> 02:12.733
Meet Lakeisha.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.169
She's a young ingenue
hoping to strike it big

02:15.269 --> 02:18.406
on the burgeoning
Seattle jazz scene. (laughs)

02:18.506 --> 02:20.608
Skoobidy, bup, bup, bitch.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.577
Harper, calm down.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.679
That prank got me
a lot of followers.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.415
And Chris and I are
on each other's

02:27.515 --> 02:29.049
close friends maps now.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.084
He's buying
illegal fireworks in Vancouver

02:31.185 --> 02:34.087
- as we speak.
- Oh, my God. So cool.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.989
Girl, I don't care!

02:36.089 --> 02:38.559
You need to tell him
to go to hell and block him.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.929
No. I will not choose violence.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.365
Then why does it look
like you're murdering

02:44.465 --> 02:46.166
that pillow you're knitting?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.936
How many times do I have to
tell you this is crocheting?

02:49.036 --> 02:50.938
I even crocheted you
that scarf that says,

02:51.038 --> 02:53.006
"Crocheting and knitting
are two different things!"

02:53.106 --> 02:56.076
Yeah, you don't seem
angry at all.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.312
Okay, you're right.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.780
But I'm dealing with it.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.517
Good! Because keeping it
bottled up isn't healthy.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.219
Actually, it is.

03:05.319 --> 03:09.323
According to certified
joy-ologist Sunny Johnson.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.592
Joy-ologist?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.394
So an influencer who listened
to one episode

03:13.494 --> 03:16.530
of a Goop meditation podcast,
now she thinks she a doctor?

03:16.630 --> 03:19.700
Oh, she listened
to all the episodes.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.102
If anyone knows how to deal
with anger, it's her.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.505
And she's coming over
to drink soft seltzer

03:24.605 --> 03:26.307
and give me advice
she only gives people

03:26.407 --> 03:27.941
at Patreon level five.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.379
We are so close to you
joining another cult.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.813
(knock at door)

03:32.913 --> 03:34.515
Who's feeling bubbly?

03:34.615 --> 03:35.649
Sunny!

03:35.749 --> 03:38.085
Sunny Johnson, PhD.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.354
That stands for
"pretty happy, dude."

03:41.221 --> 03:45.125
Oh, I'm Harper Bettencourt,
IDGAF.

03:45.225 --> 03:50.097
And that stands for
"I dance, gather and forage."

03:50.664 --> 03:52.533
You guys are a hoot!

03:52.633 --> 03:56.770
So, Carly, are you ready to deal
with your anger Sunny style?

03:56.870 --> 03:58.506
Yes! Oh.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.708
So, what is Sunny style?

04:00.808 --> 04:03.511
When you feel angry,
I always say,

04:03.611 --> 04:05.446
"Girl, hit something!"

04:05.546 --> 04:07.548
As in hit the gym
and work it out.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.082
Hit the grill and cook it out.

04:09.182 --> 04:13.887
Hit the bar and drink
until you feel invincible.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.591
That sounds incredible.

04:17.691 --> 04:20.561
That sounds like alcoholism.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.964
Have you ever thought about...

04:24.064 --> 04:27.100
I don't know, maybe talking
to the person directly?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.603
You are such a hoot!

04:29.703 --> 04:31.171
You know, I think I get it.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.006
We're influencers.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.242
And our followers
want authenticity,

04:35.343 --> 04:37.445
so we curate
a positive version of that.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.313
Oh, so you lie.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.015
You are such a--

04:42.115 --> 04:45.252
If you call me a hoot
one more time...

04:47.688 --> 04:50.023
She seems nice.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.192
* *

04:54.127 --> 04:55.195
Ugh!

04:55.295 --> 04:57.565
I cannot believe
this is happening to me.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.468
I don't want to talk about it,
so don't bother asking.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.302
- I won't.
- What's going on?

05:02.403 --> 05:04.338
Finally. Thank you!

05:05.238 --> 05:06.607
This is a confusing age.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.542
I got partnered
with Derek Fox-Lubiner

05:08.642 --> 05:10.043
for my English project.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.480
Derek Fox-Lubiner?
The coolest guy in school?

05:12.580 --> 05:16.116
- This is a disaster!
- What? Why? Millicent's cool.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.185
He's gonna make her
do all the work

05:18.285 --> 05:19.920
while he's off
playing freeze tag

05:20.020 --> 05:21.489
with the rest
of the popular kids.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.890
That was always my move.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.858
Okay.
Well, I'll call your teacher

05:24.958 --> 05:26.560
and see if I can get you
a different partner.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.497
Are you trying
to destroy me? No!

05:29.597 --> 05:31.231
- (sighs)
- Real confusing age.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.767
Hey, m'dudes.

05:33.867 --> 05:37.371
Oh, whoa, M&M, new kicks?
I like.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.841
Oh, you like?
Well, I like that you like.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.911
Do all the kids at school
call you M&M?

05:44.011 --> 05:46.847
No, just D-money. And I'm
the only one who calls him that.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.950
Oh. Well, what are you guys
working on, D-money?

05:50.050 --> 05:52.285
I'm gonna throw this one to M&M.

05:52.386 --> 05:55.723
Why? You got a freeze tag
game to get to?

05:55.823 --> 05:58.158
- What's freeze tag?
- I don't know.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.828
Something stupid
Freddie keeps bringing up.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.231
The project is called
"Page to Plate."

06:04.331 --> 06:07.768
We have to cook a meal
based on the 1691 Irish tragedy,

06:07.868 --> 06:09.503
"A Christmas Pie for Emily."

06:09.603 --> 06:12.440
Yeah, 'cause you know
how in books there's pages

06:12.540 --> 06:14.442
and in food there's plates?

06:14.542 --> 06:15.843
- Oh.
- Yeah, I got that.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.911
Yeah, me too.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.080
And then we get
to write a report.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.349
Millicent is so good at reports.

06:22.450 --> 06:26.019
OMG, stop it, I'm dead.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.190
- I'll go find a table.
- 'Kay. (giggles)

06:33.894 --> 06:35.929
Well, now I see
why you were so nervous

06:36.029 --> 06:37.765
to be paired with Derek.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.467
You like him.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.537
Oh, my little girl's
becoming a little woman.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.539
And here comes a little tear.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.040
You're way too young
to have a crush,

06:47.140 --> 06:49.510
so I forbid it, crush over.
Problem solved.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.912
Hey, not-the-father, calm down.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.346
Let's just let the wonder

06:53.447 --> 06:55.583
of Millicent's first crush
unfold naturally.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.886
"First." Yeah.
We'll go with that.

07:00.287 --> 07:03.123
* *

07:03.223 --> 07:05.459
(indistinct conversation
and laughter)

07:08.496 --> 07:11.899
Nice day of not dealing with
the root cause of your feelings?

07:11.999 --> 07:14.367
Yes. Thank you for asking.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.871
We hit the mall, the bar,
the gym.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.740
Kind of wish we swapped
the order.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.976
I'm really sorry I threw up
on you during Hot Bitch Yoga.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.413
Oh, I saw your Instagram.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.882
And it seems like
it was definitely about

07:28.982 --> 07:30.751
addressing your feelings

07:30.851 --> 07:32.753
and not at all
about making peace signs

07:32.853 --> 07:34.187
and sticking your tongue out

07:34.287 --> 07:36.590
as if the picture
was taken by mistake.

07:37.357 --> 07:40.628
I feel so refreshed
and just free of anger.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.295
Carly, you're
rage-knitting again.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.431
It's rage-crocheting!

07:45.899 --> 07:47.868
Oh, my God.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.771
Sunny, what do I do?
It's still in me.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.473
Don't worry, Carly.
It's going to be okay.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.243
There's still one more thing
we can hit.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.812
(grunting)

07:58.912 --> 08:00.714
Each other.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.316
Ladies, welcome...

08:04.718 --> 08:07.120
...to Influencer Fight Club.

08:12.025 --> 08:16.530
I don't know how yet,
but this feels racist.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.231
* *

08:23.804 --> 08:25.238
* *

08:25.338 --> 08:26.940
Influencer Fight Club
is basically

08:27.040 --> 08:28.942
"Girl, hit something"
on steroids.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.978
Which, by the way,
do not mix well

08:31.078 --> 08:33.814
with the diarrhea tea
that sponsors me.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.116
(groans)

08:36.216 --> 08:37.751
Is this a squid game?

08:37.851 --> 08:41.388
No. This is a safe place
for us nice influencers

08:41.488 --> 08:44.057
to get our anger out in private.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.358
(influencers groaning)

08:45.458 --> 08:47.394
And you're part of it now.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.397
Aw. You think I'm nice?

08:50.931 --> 08:53.333
Let me guess, the first rule
about Fight Club

08:53.433 --> 08:55.468
is you do not talk
about Fight Club.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.972
No. That's just
an incredibly obvious given.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.675
The first rule is
protect the face.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.077
These babies
are our moneymakers.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.545
(grunts)

09:05.646 --> 09:08.616
I gotta go.
The diarrhea tea's kicking in.

09:10.951 --> 09:15.723
If you get in that ring, Carly,
two words: throat punch.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.257
Are you actually suggesting

09:17.357 --> 09:18.859
that I stay here
and I fight someone?

09:18.959 --> 09:20.661
Oh, it's kind of like
kickboxing,

09:20.761 --> 09:22.229
and I do that every week.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.765
Plus, it might actually help you
get out your anger.

09:24.865 --> 09:28.468
Harper, nobody thinks
I can fight.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.504
The Army told me,
"Nah, we're good."

09:32.239 --> 09:34.708
* *

09:36.276 --> 09:40.147
Oh, look. A Christmas pie recipe
that takes less than five hours.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.415
I wouldn't mind spending
five hours with you.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.384
- (chuckles) Derek.
- What?

09:44.484 --> 09:46.186
I was just saying your name.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.122
Ha. Nice. I'm gonna go pee.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.557
Nice.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.764
(squeals) Derek Fox-Lubiner
likes Millicent!

09:56.864 --> 09:58.966
I wonder if the restaurant
in the Space Needle is available

09:59.066 --> 10:01.234
for a Christmas Eve wedding
in 2042.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.271
Whoa, lean back, Fat Joe.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.774
Sure, it seems like
Derek is reciprocating

10:06.874 --> 10:08.308
Millicent's feelings,
but don't you think

10:08.408 --> 10:09.476
that's a little convenient?

10:09.576 --> 10:10.577
Kid's up to something.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.680
This is not good, guys.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.448
I'm trying to focus
on my English project,

10:15.548 --> 10:17.851
but all I want to do
is listen to Adele

10:17.951 --> 10:20.353
and think
about D-money on a Jet Ski.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.622
I'm gonna go make you
some oolong tea.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.893
It's perfect for when
you're longing for someone.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.527
(laughs)

10:27.627 --> 10:29.162
I can't talk right now.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.964
Okay, fine, Mom, you were right.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.700
I just had to be nice,
and now she does

10:32.800 --> 10:34.167
whatever I say.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.502
(gasps)

10:35.602 --> 10:37.104
Spencer!
You were right about Derek!

10:37.204 --> 10:39.973
He uses jojoba oil
to get that hair volume?

10:40.073 --> 10:41.474
No. Do--

10:41.574 --> 10:43.010
He's just being nice
to Millicent

10:43.110 --> 10:44.878
to get her to do
whatever he says.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.681
(gasps) I invited that boy
into our family.

10:47.781 --> 10:51.618
J'ai reçu ce garçon
dans notre famille.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.621
That means the same thing.
I'm just learning French.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.323
We should split the work.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.358
Maybe one of us does the report,
and the other does the pie?

10:58.458 --> 11:01.795
You're so smart and talented.
I wish we had two of you.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.964
Wish granted. I'll do both.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.398
Lame!

11:05.498 --> 11:06.934
Lame means cool now.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.336
We have to tell her.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.772
Let me do it so I can gloat
about being right.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.708
No, we can't break her heart.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.277
What if we convince her
not to like Derek?

11:20.613 --> 11:22.615
(gasps) Sorry,
I can officially sleep

11:22.716 --> 11:24.852
with my eyes open now.
Did you say something?

11:26.987 --> 11:28.989
* *

11:31.759 --> 11:33.626
If we sneak out of here,
do you think they'll notice?

11:33.727 --> 11:35.528
Unfortunately, they will.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.297
My presence in a room
is unmissable.

11:37.397 --> 11:41.468
But, look, let's just take a lap
and get a lay of the land.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.804
Carly! I'm Kelly.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.506
- (grunts)
- I am such a fan.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.408
I really hope I get
to fight you.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.879
It would just be an honor
to wipe the floor with your ass.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.647
The honor would be my ass's.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.216
(sighs) Don't worry.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.918
Most people don't even need
both their kidneys.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.152
I'm Elena.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.721
You're the girl
who takes topless photos

12:01.822 --> 12:03.390
in front of national landmarks.

12:03.490 --> 12:06.059
That's me. Mammifest Chestiny.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.662
And wait, you the girl
who takes bottomless photos

12:09.763 --> 12:11.398
in front of war memorials.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.501
Yep. Purple Heart, White Cheeks.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.070
People online are always
pitting us against each other.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.473
They're trying to make us like
the Nicki Minaj and Cardi B

12:20.573 --> 12:22.509
of tasteful patriotic nudity.

12:22.609 --> 12:26.146
Yeah. And luckily, when I want
to throttle the neck

12:26.246 --> 12:28.415
of every commenter
who criticizes us,

12:28.515 --> 12:31.651
I can come here and just,
you know, smack somebody around.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.687
And then I feel better.
Self-care.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.724
Or you could just limit
your comments.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.226
Or even not read 'em.

12:39.326 --> 12:42.229
Nah, we'd rather come here
and fight it out.

12:42.329 --> 12:45.098
Most people don't even need
both their kidneys.

12:45.632 --> 12:46.834
You already said that.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.302
Well, obviously,
it bears repeating.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.871
Maybe we should leave.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.006
The one in the far corner
with the wide-set eyes

12:53.106 --> 12:54.942
has been mad-dogging my liver,

12:55.042 --> 12:57.811
and last time I checked,
I need both the ones I got.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.948
Where do you two
think you're going?

13:01.048 --> 13:02.582
Oh, um...

13:02.682 --> 13:04.151
If it's your first night
at Fight Club,

13:04.251 --> 13:05.318
you have to fight.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.688
Have to, as in must to?

13:08.788 --> 13:11.324
You've seen
Influencer Fight Club.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.460
To make sure you won't
tell anyone about it,

13:13.560 --> 13:15.062
you must become one of us.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.897
Wait, so you're blackmailing me?

13:16.997 --> 13:20.367
Uhm, it's African
American-mailing. And yes.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.604
I told you this place
was racist.

13:24.704 --> 13:27.407
* *

13:29.242 --> 13:31.044
Hey. Hey! (yells)

13:31.144 --> 13:33.813
Okay, look, we gotta be brutal
and honest,

13:33.914 --> 13:35.648
like an Estonian mother.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.050
No. No, this is gonna work.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.818
I can convince Millicent
not to like Derek.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.221
She is not gonna take
your advice on romance.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.656
You haven't had
a girlfriend in years.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.926
I literally have
a girlfriend right now.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.795
No, I don't think that's right.

13:51.031 --> 13:54.034
Hey. How's the project going,
Milli Vanill'?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.736
Great! I suggested
we dress up like characters

13:56.836 --> 13:59.639
from the book,
and Derek said, "Lame."

13:59.739 --> 14:01.008
Lame means cool now.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.144
So I gotta get
a costume together.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.845
It's gonna be like a date,
but schoolwork.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.547
So a fun date.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.150
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Check out
this app I just downloaded.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.185
It shows you with one hundred
percent accuracy

14:12.285 --> 14:14.187
what you're going to look like
when you get older.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.357
I couldn't help myself
and I uploaded Derek's picture.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.628
- Woof. Am I right?
- Aw.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.497
Does this mean you think
we're gonna grow old together?

14:24.597 --> 14:26.366
Do me next!

14:28.501 --> 14:31.404
Well, that failed.
Time for the Estonian approach.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.706
I'm gonna need an egg.
Preferably pheasant.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.608
Duck will do.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.711
No, let me--let me break it
to her.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.848
(sighs) Hey, Millicent...

14:41.949 --> 14:43.383
I gotta tell you something.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.785
I overheard Derek
telling his mother that he was

14:45.885 --> 14:48.922
just being nice to you to get
you to do whatever he says.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.590
We thought you should know.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.859
I thought you should know
earlier. I'm the hero here.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.362
Why the heck would I
want to know?

14:55.462 --> 14:57.097
You've ruined my life!

14:57.197 --> 14:59.399
Now I have to go scratch out
our initials

14:59.499 --> 15:01.201
from a lot of trees.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.037
* *

15:05.738 --> 15:09.542
(cheering, excited chatter)

15:09.642 --> 15:11.278
You got this, Carly Shay.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.314
And if you don't, you can
catch up on TV in the hospital.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.750
Come on, girl. Hit something!

15:17.850 --> 15:19.586
But again, not the face.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.022
I'm rooting for you, Carly!
I got a hundred on Sunny,

15:22.122 --> 15:23.856
but I'm rooting for you!

15:25.592 --> 15:28.295
Okay, here we go.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.830
Totally hitting you.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.334
Definitely gonna hit you.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.369
Am I doing it?

15:37.270 --> 15:39.739
Okay, let's make that
$200 on Sunny.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.675
(laughter)

15:42.775 --> 15:44.577
What are you two laughing at?

15:44.677 --> 15:46.879
Can't you see I'm fighting
for my life in here?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.082
Carly, this is, like,
the funniest video

15:49.182 --> 15:51.951
you've ever been in. So good.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.689
CARLY:
I've never been to a prom
at a hospital before.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.558
Is it cool if I sneak away
at some point

15:58.658 --> 16:00.627
and have a doctor look
at my jacked-up elbows?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.695
CHRIS:
That's the hospital
from Grey's Anatomy!

16:02.795 --> 16:06.066
You've been pranked
by the Prank Prince!

16:06.166 --> 16:08.568
I can't believe you fell for it!

16:08.668 --> 16:11.671
Pffft! Pffft! Pffft!

16:11.771 --> 16:13.073
Hilarious.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.343
(screams with rage)

16:16.443 --> 16:18.545
ALL:
Oh!

16:18.645 --> 16:21.481
Oh, God! I am so sorry.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.150
You will be hearing
from my lawyer

16:23.250 --> 16:25.485
if there's any lasting damage
to my face.

16:26.453 --> 16:29.189
But I am proud of you, girl!

16:29.289 --> 16:31.024
(laughing):
Oh, man!

16:31.124 --> 16:32.459
I got you all so good.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.627
Pe, pe, pe, peo!

16:34.727 --> 16:36.596
Chris? What are you doing here?

16:36.696 --> 16:39.799
I've just been following you
around on the close friends map.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.434
Oh, so you're just a stalker?

16:41.534 --> 16:44.937
Yeah, but, like, in a funny way.
(laughs)

16:45.038 --> 16:47.040
And then I saw
this whole fight club.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.209
Once I post this video
of all you influencers

16:49.309 --> 16:51.111
beating the hell
out of each other,

16:51.211 --> 16:54.147
everyone's gonna know
you're all fake. (laughs)

16:54.247 --> 16:56.783
But, like, not in a funny way.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.252
Prank, prank! Pffft!

17:04.691 --> 17:07.960
People aren't just mad at me
for punching Sunny.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.897
All the influencers at Fight
Club are losing brand deals.

17:10.997 --> 17:14.267
Oh, man, Sunny lost her contract
with Live Laugh Loofah.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.703
The shower scrub that offers
words of affirmation?

17:16.803 --> 17:19.706
It gets rid of dead skin cells
and negative thoughts.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.708
She gonna be dirty and sad.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.811
This is all my fault.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.080
Oh, that's one way
to look at it.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.148
What's another way?

17:28.248 --> 17:30.617
Oh, there's really just the one.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.052
Well, it's Chris's fault, too.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.488
He used a map for evil.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.090
Like a pirate.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.259
Yes, let it out.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.494
He targeted me for being kind.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.995
That's right, get mad!

17:43.096 --> 17:46.133
You know, I'm a nice person,
but don't fudge with me!

17:46.233 --> 17:47.200
Mm-hmm.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.836
Girl, hit something.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.973
He's not even good at pranks!

17:54.073 --> 17:55.208
He's not!

17:55.308 --> 17:57.277
And you never unload
the dishwasher.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.346
I won't argue,
'cause you're making progress.

17:59.446 --> 18:03.416
And Meyer lemons taste the same
as regular lemons!

18:03.516 --> 18:05.285
They're sweeter, but go on, sis!

18:05.385 --> 18:08.455
Yes, give me those tiny punches.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.391
And they picked Bran to be king?

18:11.491 --> 18:16.996
Bran? He was gone
for a whole season!

18:20.567 --> 18:23.703
- I feel so much better.
- All right!

18:23.803 --> 18:26.005
You want to buy
some Live Laugh Loofahs?

18:27.540 --> 18:32.979
No. I want to rake my nails
across Chris's eyeballs

18:33.079 --> 18:36.983
until blood spurts out of them
and I can drink it.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.252
Okay.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.887
I see you've reached catharsis.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.489
Now you just need closure.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.091
What I need is a straw
so I can drink

18:45.192 --> 18:47.294
Chris's eyeball blood.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.598
Okay, yeah, maybe I need
some closure.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.302
* *

18:56.769 --> 18:58.705
Millicent, why are you
all dressed up

18:58.805 --> 19:00.240
if you're just
gonna confront Derek?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.675
Have you ever heard
of a revenge outfit?

19:03.543 --> 19:05.111
The zipper got stuck.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.279
(knock at door)

19:07.314 --> 19:09.015
What's lame?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.885
Derek. Sit.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.723
Ah.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.160
Does anyone else
want to sit too?

19:21.261 --> 19:24.163
- I'll stand, thanks.
- You do you.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.099
I will do me, but not
because you told me to.

19:28.435 --> 19:30.270
Did you say something
to your mom on the phone

19:30.370 --> 19:33.406
about being nice so that
"she does whatever you say"?

19:34.241 --> 19:37.844
- Yes, but I was--
- But, but, but, but, but!

19:38.611 --> 19:41.848
I should have known better
than to fall for your tricks.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.217
After all, I am human,
while you have

19:44.317 --> 19:47.119
the emotional intelligence
of an energy drink.

19:47.220 --> 19:50.122
Millicent, I was talking
about my puppy, Athena.

19:50.223 --> 19:53.025
I've been having trouble
with her, but our trainer said

19:53.125 --> 19:56.229
if we were nicer,
she would do whatever I say.

19:56.329 --> 19:59.266
BOTH:
Oh...

19:59.799 --> 20:01.701
But you made me do all the work.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.603
I didn't make you. You offered.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.873
Which makes sense, 'cause you're
really good at doing projects.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.309
And I'm really good
at having cool haircuts.

20:10.477 --> 20:11.878
I was just trying
to make you happy.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.613
BOTH:
Aw.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.982
Why would you want me
to be happy?

20:16.082 --> 20:18.084
Because D-money loves her.

20:18.184 --> 20:23.055
M&M, you're smart.
I think you know why.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.459
Space Needle?
I'd like to book a wedding.

20:26.559 --> 20:30.162
Christmas Eve, 2042.
I'll be paying in crypto--

20:30.263 --> 20:31.764
She hung up.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.666
(indistinct conversation)

20:33.766 --> 20:36.836
My lil' Milli Vanill'
has a boyfriend.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.539
Oh, wow, a boyfriend. Um...

20:39.639 --> 20:41.007
When you say the word like that,

20:41.107 --> 20:42.875
just out loud, you know,
with your mouth...

20:42.975 --> 20:44.477
Catch me, dude.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.212
- I'm gonna faint.
- Oh, I got you.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.214
Got--there he is.

20:48.315 --> 20:51.584
* *

20:52.419 --> 20:56.989
I'm ready for closure.
With my cathar-sisterhood.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.592
I never should have
taught you that word.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.461
Shut up, he's here.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.597
Hello? I'm here for
the discount illegal fireworks.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.400
Oh, Chris. (chuckles)

21:07.500 --> 21:10.337
Chris, Chris, Chris.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.105
Carly. I didn't know
you were into fireworks.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.442
Want to go grab come M-80s
and piss off some dogs?

21:15.542 --> 21:17.009
There are no fireworks, Chris.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.878
It didn't tip you off

21:18.978 --> 21:21.348
when Lakeisha the jazz singer
invited you

21:21.448 --> 21:24.384
to the very warehouse
Fight Club was held in?

21:25.452 --> 21:26.653
No.

21:26.753 --> 21:27.987
All right, bye.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.221
Kelly, get the door.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.424
* *

21:34.226 --> 21:35.895
What, am I supposed
to be scared?

21:35.995 --> 21:38.164
Okay, I'm scared.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.299
You should be.

21:41.401 --> 21:44.036
You hurt my feelings
when you took advantage

21:44.136 --> 21:46.272
of my kindness, Chris.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.140
You hurt 'em real bad.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.478
I thought we were friends.
Friends, Chris.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.480
Like the show.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.048
What do I have to say
to make this stop?

21:56.148 --> 21:57.984
Oh, you don't have
to say a word,

21:58.084 --> 21:59.819
'cause we're gonna say 'em all.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.954
(clamoring)

22:02.054 --> 22:04.891
Oh, okay. Is this a prank?
Where are the cameras?

22:04.991 --> 22:07.326
Oh, no. This isn't a prank.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.496
This is just for us.

22:09.596 --> 22:12.865
And it's gonna be
healthy as hell.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.367
You're up, Kelly.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.936
(clamoring, cheering)

22:18.037 --> 22:21.841
Chris, because you exposed
Influencer Fight Club,

22:21.941 --> 22:24.010
all of my sponsors dropped me.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.945
(disappointed sighs)

22:26.045 --> 22:27.780
I mean, I got new ones

22:27.880 --> 22:29.582
and I actually
make more money now,

22:29.682 --> 22:30.850
but you made me do paperwork.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.152
(gasping, murmuring)

22:33.252 --> 22:34.186
Hey, Chris!

22:34.286 --> 22:37.089
(cheering)

22:38.491 --> 22:41.160
Influencer Fight Club
was the only thing

22:41.260 --> 22:43.996
that brought me happiness
and you took that away from me.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.798
Whose ass am I supposed
to kick now?

22:45.898 --> 22:48.234
I think Chris's ass.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.904
(yelps, moans)

22:52.004 --> 22:53.740
Right in the moneymaker!

22:53.840 --> 22:56.409
(cheering)

22:56.509 --> 22:57.810
(thudding)

22:57.910 --> 23:00.079
Hope he still has
that hospital gown.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.181
- Smackdown selfie?
- Oh, yeah!

23:03.883 --> 23:06.218
(camera clicks)

23:06.318 --> 23:07.854
* *

23:07.954 --> 23:11.758
You pranked him with a fake
fireworks sale? That's nothing.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.292
Just let me have this.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.294
Plus, your Pranks
Anonymous sponsor

23:15.394 --> 23:17.564
said you shouldn't even
be talking about pranks.

23:17.664 --> 23:20.066
I'm not! I'm talking about

23:20.166 --> 23:22.569
other ways you could've
gotten closure.

23:22.669 --> 23:25.605
Like putting clear nail polish
on his soap,

23:25.705 --> 23:29.141
or replacing every book
in his apartment with Twilight,

23:29.241 --> 23:31.410
or sending him a photo of me

23:31.511 --> 23:33.846
licking all of his pens
two weeks earlier.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.148
Oh, God, I've got a taste
and I need more.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.785
- I gotta prank! Hold me back!
- (both scream)

23:38.885 --> 23:40.052
It's not working!

23:40.152 --> 23:41.621
- You're too small!
- I know!

23:41.721 --> 23:42.889
- Get bigger!
- I can't!

23:42.989 --> 23:44.491
(screams)
Where's my pranking kit?

24:12.084 --> 24:13.786
Ooh!

24:13.886 --> 24:16.088
MAN:
He hates these cans.
