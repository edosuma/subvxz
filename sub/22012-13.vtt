WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.536
ADULT ADAM:
Ah, wood-shop class.

00:02.603 --> 00:05.039
Back in the '80s, this
sawdust-covered danger zone

00:05.106 --> 00:07.308
was a place where students
handled heavy-duty machinery

00:07.375 --> 00:09.377
no kid should ever touch.

00:09.443 --> 00:12.280
Whoa!
That almost hit me, dude!

00:12.346 --> 00:14.682
I know! I should not
be around this equipment!

00:14.748 --> 00:16.484
ADULT ADAM:
No matter what school
you went to,

00:16.550 --> 00:18.986
all shop teachers were cut
from the same piece of wood.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.854
Ours was Mr. Crosby.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.257
And remember...
Safety first.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.659
There's no room
for tomfoolery, shenanigans,

00:25.726 --> 00:28.028
or joyful horseplay
in this class.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.363
And why is that?

00:29.430 --> 00:31.399
ALL:
We'll cut off our finger.

00:31.465 --> 00:34.001
And why do we always
measure twice?

00:34.068 --> 00:35.969
ALL:
We'll cut off our finger.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.905
And how do we know this
to be true?

00:37.971 --> 00:39.973
ALL:
You cut off your finger.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.343
That's right.
I cut off my finger.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.011
And this one!

00:44.078 --> 00:46.947
This one they sewed back on,
but it doesn't work right.

00:47.014 --> 00:48.382
Finger rejected the host.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.418
ADULT ADAM: Yep,
wood shop was
grueling and difficult

00:50.484 --> 00:52.686
and only came naturally
to the select few.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.888
Check it, Mom.
I made a spice rack.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.290
Oh, my God,

00:56.357 --> 00:58.526
I was literally just saying
this is exactly what I need.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.961
Whoo-hoo! Look at you,
saving us money!

01:01.028 --> 01:03.097
We can put spices
in that.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.532
ADULT ADAM:
Me, on the other hand...

01:04.598 --> 01:07.468
Hey, Mom, look what I made.
It's a doorstop or a bookend.

01:07.535 --> 01:11.139
Oh, look.
Murray, Adam made a thing.

01:11.205 --> 01:15.409
Hoo-hoo! Look at you,
saving money on firewood!

01:15.476 --> 01:18.446
That's what it is.
A starter log.
I feel good about this.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.548
ADULT ADAM:
Yeah, I guess you could say
I didn't nail wood shop.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.351
So instead, I used the class
to hone my comedic skills.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.254
All right.
This is a butt joint.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.788
See here?

01:27.855 --> 01:30.858
You line up the studs,
and then you pound
that butt joint

01:30.924 --> 01:32.693
until it locks in tight.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.761
Questions?

01:33.827 --> 01:35.363
I got a question.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.998
What's the best thing to use
to wipe your butt joint?

01:40.968 --> 01:43.271
He took something wholesome,
like a butt joint,

01:43.337 --> 01:44.472
and made it hilarious!

01:44.538 --> 01:45.773
Since we're all in the mood
to have a laugh,

01:45.839 --> 01:47.875
why don't you show the class
your midterm project?

01:47.941 --> 01:49.343
You've got it, sir.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.045
I call it
"Really Big Jenga"!

01:53.547 --> 01:56.617
That's just a bunch of 2x4s
you sawed in half
and stacked up.

01:56.684 --> 01:57.918
You didn't even sand them.

01:57.985 --> 02:00.154
Geez, if it's such a big deal,
I'll use this thingy

02:00.221 --> 02:01.989
to sand the wood,
and then we can play.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.525
Nobody's playing
Really Big Jenga,
Mr. Hardeeharhar!

02:04.592 --> 02:05.926
Give me that wood.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.495
Oh!
Balls!

02:07.561 --> 02:09.163
Whoa!

02:10.698 --> 02:12.233
Jenga.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.834
* I'm twisted up inside

02:13.901 --> 02:17.505
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:19.940 --> 02:21.375
* I don't know the future

02:21.442 --> 02:24.645
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:24.712 --> 02:27.381
ADULT ADAM:
It was January 17,
1980-something,

02:27.448 --> 02:30.218
and my sister was going
through a true freshman
rite of passage...

02:30.284 --> 02:31.819
Becoming a pretentious snob.

02:31.885 --> 02:36.357
God, it all has to go, Erica.
Poison, Madonna, New Kids?

02:36.424 --> 02:39.360
How did I ever buy into
all of this top-40,
MTV garbage?

02:39.427 --> 02:41.629
I'm actually embarrassed
by who we were

02:41.695 --> 02:43.764
before we took
Music Deconstruction 101

02:43.831 --> 02:45.098
with Professor
Chang-Silverstein.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.401
That class has, like,
opened my eyes.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.136
No, like, my ears.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.171
No, like, my mind.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.274
Well, get ready to have
your mind blown,

02:53.341 --> 02:55.042
because I asked Geoff
to get us tickets

02:55.108 --> 02:57.911
to the Avant Garde Music
Festival of New York City.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.547
Stop, we are actually
going to see

02:59.613 --> 03:01.582
Philip Glass and the Tibetan
Throat Singers live?

03:01.649 --> 03:04.352
Plus, there's a rumor
that Yoko Ono
is gonna scream onstage

03:04.418 --> 03:05.686
for a whole hour!

03:05.753 --> 03:07.355
I'm gonna scream from
the audience for a whole hour!

03:07.421 --> 03:09.223
I can't believe
that our lame-ass R.A.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.458
called us
"poser freshmen

03:10.524 --> 03:12.192
"who are going through
a pretentious phase."

03:12.260 --> 03:14.728
These personas we just
discovered, like, last week

03:14.795 --> 03:16.497
are, like, who we are
and are gonna be

03:16.564 --> 03:17.631
for the rest of our lives.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.568
Exactly. I'll never return
to who I was.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.904
Oh! My baby's back!

03:23.971 --> 03:26.006
Whoa, how long were you
standing there waiting?

03:26.073 --> 03:28.075
So long.
Come right in.

03:28.141 --> 03:31.545
Would anyone like to sample
a flight of Hamburger Helpers?

03:31.612 --> 03:34.515
Oh, we're not doing
processed foods anymore,

03:34.582 --> 03:36.550
and especially not the kind
that have a spokesglove.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.886
What's, like,
the raddest sushi place
you have in Jenkintown?

03:38.952 --> 03:40.020
You like fish?

03:40.087 --> 03:41.889
Uh, well, we have
a Long John Silver's.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.691
No! Wait!

03:43.757 --> 03:45.259
I've got Tuna Helper
right here.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.494
Geoff, crack open a can.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.296
Hey, Erica, it's me,
your boyfriend, Geoff.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.897
Oh, he's plating it
all wrong.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.433
I said, "Two heaping scoops,"
Geoff.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.801
Two!

03:53.867 --> 03:54.902
Hey, babe,
you get the tickets?

03:54.968 --> 03:56.904
You know it.
The Hooters, third row.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.506
Okay, why would we go see
The Hooters?

03:58.572 --> 04:00.508
Um, because
it's our hometown's
favorite band

04:00.574 --> 04:02.075
and, also, you're, like,
the hugest fan ever.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.878
Geoff, I specifically left
a message for you
to get tickets

04:04.945 --> 04:06.414
for the Avant Garde Festival.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.948
Right, and I didn't understand
what that was,

04:08.015 --> 04:09.550
so I ignored it
and got third-row center.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.652
I cannot miss this festival,
okay?

04:11.719 --> 04:14.888
Yoko Ono is finally gonna
free herself from the shadow

04:14.955 --> 04:16.357
of her husband's
bubblegum band.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.691
You mean... The Beatles?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.460
You know what? It's fine.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.929
I'll just do my own thing,
and you can take Barry
to go see The Hooters.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.764
At least let me
buy you girls dessert.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.333
Oh, there's a new
wudder-ice place.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.234
Oh, man!
Their wudder ice is amazing!

04:27.301 --> 04:29.169
Okay. What are you people
talking about?

04:29.236 --> 04:30.371
Wudder ice.
Wudder ice.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.473
Wudder ice.
What's "wudder"?

04:32.540 --> 04:34.041
They're trying to say
"water ice."

04:34.107 --> 04:35.108
It's a local dessert.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.611
Ew. Your food and words
are gross.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.913
I say we drive straight
until we find some culture.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.016
The Hooters.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.118
Did my daughter
just say "water,"

04:45.185 --> 04:46.354
like she's
from Delaware?

04:46.420 --> 04:49.457
I think she did.
Ugh. College was a mistake.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.725
Huge.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.194
Thank you
for coming down here,
Mr. Goldberg.

04:54.261 --> 04:57.398
It seems there's been
a serious mishap
with some machinery.

04:57.465 --> 05:00.233
Damn right.
Why do you always wear a tie
in shop class, anyway?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.336
It literally can get caught
in everything.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.373
I dress nice for the wood
because I honor the wood.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.107
I expect the same
from my students.

05:07.174 --> 05:11.712
I get the boy can be
a bit of a smartass,
but it's just wood.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.614
I don't know why
you got to honor it.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.383
I'll tell you why, sir.

05:15.449 --> 05:18.586
I lived in a suspended
bamboo cage for three years.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.920
Oh, boy.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.055
Uh, Derek, while we all
thank you for your service,

05:22.122 --> 05:23.256
I don't think
we need to hear...

05:23.323 --> 05:25.593
It was a simple design,
but sturdy as hell.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.562
Naturally, I tried to
saw through it
with a crude tool

05:28.629 --> 05:30.798
I had fashioned from my hair
and some toenails.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.666
Could we just
stay on course...

05:32.733 --> 05:35.669
But as time wore on,
the jungle madness took me.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.938
I tried to summon
a monkey army to free me

05:38.005 --> 05:39.339
from my elegant fortress.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.774
Okay, just speed through
to the end.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.111
I soon realized that
I needed to forgive the wood

05:44.177 --> 05:45.178
that encaged me.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.614
Just, uh...

05:46.680 --> 05:49.817
And when a monsoon
swept my captors into a river,

05:49.883 --> 05:52.720
that cage became a raft
to freedom.

05:52.786 --> 05:57.324
And so, I have
dedicated my life
to the art of woodworking.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.764
Okey-dokey.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.967
I'm thinking maybe a week
of detention
should do the trick.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.002
No. You're grounded
for a month, too.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.271
What?
You got to get serious
with your schoolwork.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.741
Because in the future,
jokes can't pay the bills.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.109
Oh, yes, they can.
Ask Sinbad.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.145
I'm going to stop this.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.549
Could we just agree no more
goofing around in shop class?

06:21.615 --> 06:25.786
And you will personally
apologize to the wood.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.388
You don't have to do that.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.257
ADULT ADAM:
As my dad was rejecting
my comedy,

06:30.323 --> 06:34.462
Geoff was finding out Erica
had rejected our hometown.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.797
Geoff? I thought you ended up
going to the concert.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.432
No. Erica's doing
her own thing...

06:38.499 --> 06:40.233
Which is great.
I totally get it.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.235
Even though it's hurtful
and I don't get it at all.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.772
Don't worry. Our girl's just
going through a little phase.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.139
Is she?

06:46.206 --> 06:48.241
'Cause it kinda feels like
Erica's outgrown The Hooters

06:48.308 --> 06:50.444
and cooked fish
and attractive clothing

06:50.511 --> 06:52.913
and Philly's own
wudder ice.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.449
She kinda...
Kinda what? Say it.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.517
I can't say it.

06:56.584 --> 06:57.818
Say it, Geoff.
I don't wanna say it.

06:57.885 --> 06:58.919
If you don't say it,
I'll say it.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.220
No, don't say it.
Then say it.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.722
Erica is a giant

07:01.789 --> 07:03.557
Whoa!
What were you gonna say?

07:03.624 --> 07:05.793
That college has made her
snobby and pretentious.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.360
That's what I meant!
Well, that's not
what you said.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.629
Oh, no! I'm so upset!

07:08.696 --> 07:10.197
You made me say it!
Now I feel horrible!

07:10.263 --> 07:12.432
Pull it together, Geoff!
If we don't do something,

07:12.500 --> 07:13.967
Erica's gonna
leave Jenkintown behind

07:14.034 --> 07:16.203
to experience the world and
become an interesting person!

07:16.269 --> 07:19.039
But how do we stop it?
You can't stop it.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.574
Your only choice
is to become it.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.711
Barry, no. That brie wheel
is for an entire party.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.614
I can now handle
the richest of party cheeses

07:26.680 --> 07:30.050
since I've become accustomed
to how the other half lives.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.153
Now, pardon me,
and prepare to be amazed,

07:33.220 --> 07:35.523
as I drink this...
Water.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.992
He said it right.
How, Barry?

07:39.059 --> 07:41.128
ADULT ADAM:
Turns out, Barry had been
obsessively studying

07:41.194 --> 07:45.365
the ways of the wealthy,
thanks to one iconic
'80s TV show.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.501
Lifestyles of the Rich
and Famous?

07:47.568 --> 07:48.869
Thanks to Robin Leach,

07:48.936 --> 07:51.739
I now know everything there is
about class and wealth.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.374
I study all the episodes
to prepare myself.

07:54.441 --> 07:55.776
For what?

07:55.843 --> 07:58.779
For when I'll be the Sixers
star player and team doctor,

07:58.846 --> 08:00.247
which means,
if I get injured,

08:00.313 --> 08:02.950
I'll be able to perform
surgery on myself.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.318
I believe in you, cocoa tush!
So, you really think that

08:05.385 --> 08:07.287
Erica's like these
fancy people on this show?

08:07.354 --> 08:11.391
She's seeing Yoko Ono
being weird and artsy.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.926
She's fancy, all right.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.228
Turn us into horrible
rich people, Barry.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.931
I'm in, too.
Yay, no other options.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.967
ADULT ADAM:
While my mom and Geoff
were trying to break into

08:20.033 --> 08:22.435
the upper class,
I was just trying
to break out of my room.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.871
Why are you doing
out of your room?

08:23.937 --> 08:25.438
You're grounded
for being a moron!

08:25.505 --> 08:27.608
I can't be in that room
anymore, man.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.243
It's like a prison with all
my toys and video games.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.145
That's what you get
for telling bad jokes

08:32.212 --> 08:33.446
instead of getting
good grades.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.248
It's not like I'm gonna use
anything I've learned

08:35.315 --> 08:39.152
in shop class...
Or math or science or history.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.254
Sex Ed cleared up some rumors,
but that's it.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.592
Why do you only show interest
in the most ridiculous careers

08:44.658 --> 08:46.560
that no Goldberg has ever
succeeded in?

08:46.627 --> 08:48.729
Ridiculous?
Give me one example.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.631
Movie directing.
Puppeteer.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.666
Animation.
Foley artist.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.968
Arcade hustler.
Sci-fi cartoonist.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.437
Stage combat instructor.
Stunt man.

08:57.504 --> 09:01.474
And to top it all off,
now you want to include
"comedy guy"?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.612
Damn right.
Laughter's a real profession,
and I'm all in.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.647
In what?
This house when you're 30?

09:06.714 --> 09:09.049
I see you have your doubts,
so how about this?

09:09.116 --> 09:11.284
If I make you laugh
right now,

09:11.351 --> 09:14.154
then you'll have to
fully embrace my destiny

09:14.221 --> 09:15.623
as a professional
funny man.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.791
And what happens
when I don't laugh?
Because I won't.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.059
You can ground me
for the whole year.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.560
This is a bad deal
for you.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.629
Oh, you're on.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.030
Or as Hans and Franz
would say...

09:23.096 --> 09:25.265
"I'm gonna pump... You up."

09:25.332 --> 09:26.867
Don't do this deal.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.501
I don't want you
hanging around this house
for a whole year.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.838
Don't worry.
I'm just getting warmed up.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.539
Or as James Brown
would say...

09:32.606 --> 09:33.774
"So hot!"

09:33.841 --> 09:35.743
In the hot tub!
Yow!

09:35.809 --> 09:37.044
Too hot
in the hot tub!

09:37.110 --> 09:38.946
This is why it's dangerous
to believe in yourself.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.615
ADULT ADAM:
And with that, I gave him
every comedic weapon

09:41.682 --> 09:42.716
I had in my arsenal.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.151
I started with some Pee Wee.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.919
I know you are,
but what am I?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.855
Heh heh heh!
I did some classic movies...

09:47.921 --> 09:49.322
I'll have what she's having.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.457
...impressions...
Ooh!

09:50.523 --> 09:51.725
I found out
I'm color blind.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.827
The diagnosis came completely
out of the purple!

09:53.894 --> 09:55.228
Ooh-hoo!
...wacky wordplay...

09:55.295 --> 09:56.864
We have clearance,
Clarence.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.466
Roger, Roger.
What's our vector, Victor?

09:59.532 --> 10:01.301
...prop comedy...

10:01.368 --> 10:03.270
Where did you get
that coconut?
They're out of season.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.138
ADULT ADAM:
...even puppetry!
High five?

10:05.205 --> 10:07.007
I can't! My mouth will break!

10:07.074 --> 10:08.375
This guy...

10:08.441 --> 10:09.643
S'alright.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.579
Why did you
make that deal

10:12.646 --> 10:14.181
'Cause I'm a funny boy,

10:14.247 --> 10:15.983
and I'm gonna be
a funny big boy

10:16.049 --> 10:17.450
who makes money from it.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.386
That's truly
the first humorous thing
that you've said

10:19.452 --> 10:20.620
this whole conversation.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.022
The problem isn't me.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.792
It's my joyless grump of a dad
who has no sense of humor.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.559
Enough with the comedy,
moron!

10:26.626 --> 10:29.462
You're gonna get a regular job
like everybody else!

10:29.529 --> 10:31.164
Like what?
Eh, I don't know.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.367
A police officer, a doctor,
a... A construction worker,

10:34.434 --> 10:35.435
an Indian chief.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.237
You're just listing
the Village People!

10:37.304 --> 10:40.173
You have more chance of being
in a disco supergroup

10:40.240 --> 10:42.475
than you do from making money
telling jokes.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.377
We'll see about that.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.079
**

10:46.146 --> 10:48.115
Aah!
Too forced. Didn't buy it.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.482
I can do that again.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.187
ADULT ADAM:
My mom and Geoff
would do whatever it took

10:54.254 --> 10:56.189
to get Erica back,
even if it meant listening to

10:56.256 --> 10:59.292
this fancy lad.
Ahoy, and welcome aboard

10:59.359 --> 11:01.929
on our journey to riches
and fame-awcity.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.531
Oh, I bet the letters
stand for stuff.

11:04.597 --> 11:07.067
Oh, yes.
It's called a mammogram.

11:07.134 --> 11:10.603
And we start with C,
for clothes.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.339
From now on,
you'll only wear

11:12.405 --> 11:14.541
the finest fabric
known to man...

11:14.607 --> 11:17.044
Velvet, silk,
all the leathers.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.679
Okay, I guess we could
hit Filene's Basement,

11:19.747 --> 11:21.414
see if there's anything
in the bargain bin.

11:21.481 --> 11:25.285
Never! You now only shop
upstairs at Filene's,

11:25.352 --> 11:27.520
where they have fancy windows
and you pay full price.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.823
Full price?
Can that even be done?

11:29.890 --> 11:32.826
ADULT ADAM: Oh, it could.
Next was L, for Laughter.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.295
The kind of condescending
cackle only reserved

11:35.362 --> 11:37.597
for rich folks who know
they're better than you.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.469
Wow, yeah. That was incredibly
dismissive and hurtful.

11:42.535 --> 11:46.073
ADULT ADAM: Then came A,
for Accents, which means
you sound sophisticated,

11:46.139 --> 11:47.640
and from anywhere
but Philly.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.642
Now tell me
what's in this glass!
Don't think! Go!

11:49.709 --> 11:51.511
Water! Ooh, my God!
I'm learning!

11:51.578 --> 11:54.514
ADULT ADAM:
And last, the double S
which stood for Snooty Sauce.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.784
All you had to do was learn
how to ask for it.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.219
BOTH: Pardon me, have you
got any Grey Poupon?

11:59.286 --> 12:00.921
No!
BOTH: Pardon me,

12:00.988 --> 12:02.856
do you have
any Grey Poupon?

12:02.923 --> 12:04.057
No.
BOTH: Pardon me.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.926
Do you have any
Grey Poupon?

12:05.993 --> 12:07.761
Oh, yes.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.763
Your lesson in "class"
is complete.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.099
Now, go out there and make
the world a worse place.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.602
Look out, high society,
a mom and her
daughter's boyfriend

12:15.668 --> 12:17.404
are going to New York!

12:17.470 --> 12:18.839
Yeah, is it weird that
we've been hanging out?

12:18.906 --> 12:20.507
A little.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.375
ADULT ADAM:
While Geoff and my mom
were classing up,

12:22.442 --> 12:24.812
I was discovering
my dad was down to laugh.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.047
Hee! Hee-hee!
What was that?

12:27.114 --> 12:29.549
What was what?
You're actually laughing!

12:29.616 --> 12:32.519
At 227?
What is happening?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.187
I'll tell you
what's happening.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.323
Big Tasty's getting a taste
of the high life.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.126
Please, I'm in the middle
of a very important
discovery right now.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.660
Do not butt in
with your insanity.

12:40.727 --> 12:44.564
You know what's insane?
This delicious jar of caviar.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.999
How the hell are you paying
for caviar?

12:46.066 --> 12:47.935
No! This is not
about him right now!

12:48.001 --> 12:49.536
I cashed in
one of Nana's bonds

12:49.602 --> 12:51.939
to get a little taste
of Beverly Hills.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.608
Oh, no!

12:55.675 --> 12:57.044
It's so salty!

12:57.110 --> 12:58.778
They're fish eggs,
you moron.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.380
Fish lay eggs?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.682
It's stuck under my tongue!

13:02.749 --> 13:03.750
I need milk!

13:03.817 --> 13:05.552
That one
never disappoints!

13:05.618 --> 13:07.354
Holy balls!

13:07.420 --> 13:09.890
First you laugh at Jackée,
then at Barry?

13:09.957 --> 13:12.059
You literally laugh
at everyone but me!

13:12.125 --> 13:13.160
Hee-hee-hoo!

13:13.226 --> 13:14.895
Wait. I did it?
Did I do it?

13:14.962 --> 13:17.230
This show's hilarious!

13:17.297 --> 13:19.933
They never leave the stoop!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.768
ADULT ADAM:
My world was rocked.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.437
For the first time,
nothing was funny.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.074
Now, I want everyone to look
at my stool.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.675
This is
a very loose stool.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.913
See? I know it's just
a stool sample,
but it's a real mess.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.948
ADULT ADAM:
Thanks to my dad,

13:35.015 --> 13:36.649
my dream of comedy died.

13:36.716 --> 13:40.320
Meanwhile, Erica's avant-garde
music adventure
had just begun.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.023
It feels so liberating
to be here with, like,

13:43.090 --> 13:44.624
like-minded people,
ya know?

13:44.691 --> 13:47.594
Absolutely.
I just can't wait
to sit down and...

13:47.660 --> 13:49.629
Holy crap!
Geoff and my mom are here!

13:51.531 --> 13:53.766
Fancy seeing you here.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.668
So fancy.
Indeed!

13:55.735 --> 13:58.438
Okay, why are you here
and talking like that

13:58.505 --> 14:00.607
and dressed like
the cast of Dynasty?

14:00.673 --> 14:03.010
What, you mean these old
new full-priced rags

14:03.076 --> 14:04.945
from the real Filene's
Above Ground?

14:05.012 --> 14:06.679
Hmm. We stopped there
on the way here.

14:06.746 --> 14:07.814
Pocket square?

14:07.881 --> 14:09.682
No, I don't want
a pocket square, Geoff!

14:09.749 --> 14:11.618
Again,
why are you here?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.720
Yeah. Are you guys,
like, on a date?

14:13.786 --> 14:15.923
On a date with culture.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.891
I'm most excited for...

14:17.958 --> 14:22.495
M'baku O'Shaughnessy
and the Afro Celtic
Warbling Experience.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.465
I read about
this little musical powwow
in The New Yorker.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.235
No, you didn't. I literally
told you I was coming here.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.903
Did you, now?
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.238
What is that?
Why are you doing that?

14:31.304 --> 14:33.240
BOTH: Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.
Stop ho-ho'ing.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.741
You sound like
douchey Santas.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.743
BOTH: Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

14:36.809 --> 14:38.045
Why are you doing it?

14:38.111 --> 14:40.180
It seems like what you do.
Oh-ho!

14:40.247 --> 14:42.382
Okay, I don't know
what you two are doing,
but you need to go.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.985
We're just trying to like
what you like,
'cause, you know,

14:45.052 --> 14:47.354
you're a big
snooty jerk now.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.690
So, I'm not allowed
to go away to college
and change and grow,

14:50.757 --> 14:51.891
like a normal person?

14:51.959 --> 14:54.494
Look, of course we want you
to learn and grow.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.230
We just... Don't want you
to grow away from us.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.932
Well, none of this
is helping your case.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.733
Now please leave.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.736
Fine. Maybe I'll see you
back at home.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.738
**

15:05.805 --> 15:07.507
ERICA: I know this isn't
what you want
to hear right now,

15:07.574 --> 15:09.709
but they're actually
kind of cute together.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.179
Thanks for coming.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.447
Mr. Crosby here insisted
we do this in person.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.950
There was another incident
in shop class today.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.818
Sounds like we could have
covered this in a phone call,

15:18.885 --> 15:20.753
but I'm here,
so go for it.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.356
I was demonstrating
how to perform a mitre cut.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.558
When I bent down
to retrieve some lumber,

15:25.625 --> 15:27.394
I split my pants
clean down the middle.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.030
Having lost my balance,
I reached out
for the nearest item

15:30.097 --> 15:31.764
to steady myself,
which, unfortunately,

15:31.831 --> 15:33.433
was an active band saw.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.136
Now, while the blade did not
connect with any fingers,

15:36.203 --> 15:39.973
it did shear off
one millimeter
of this pinkie nub.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.543
Thinking fast, I ripped
my already split pants
wide open

15:43.610 --> 15:45.778
and used the fabric
as a tourniquet.

15:45.845 --> 15:49.549
Now bottomless and afraid,
I Donald Ducked about the room
in search of ice.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.552
Thankfully, I had confiscated
a Slurpee from a student,

15:52.619 --> 15:53.987
so I plunged my hand directly

15:54.054 --> 15:55.555
into the beverage
to numb the pain.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.291
As you can imagine,
I slipped on the mess,

15:58.358 --> 16:01.728
toppling directly
into my star student
Jonathan Atkins.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.831
His body was pinned
under mine,
rendering him immobile,

16:04.897 --> 16:08.968
which was problematic, as
I had completely thrown out
my back upon impact.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.171
The students howled
with laughter.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.906
Once my shoulder dislocated,
I was able to free myself

16:13.973 --> 16:15.408
and shimmy towards the door.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.744
That's when my trick knee
gave out, and I rolled

16:17.810 --> 16:18.945
right into the belt sander,

16:19.012 --> 16:22.082
which toppled directly
onto my groin.

16:22.149 --> 16:25.085
Upon impact, I... Farted...

16:25.152 --> 16:27.254
Real bad and real loud.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.057
I'm gonna stop you there.
Really

16:30.123 --> 16:32.125
Yeah. What does any of this
have to do with Adam?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.661
Today, there was one student
that did not laugh

16:34.727 --> 16:36.496
at my ballet of tragedy.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.766
In fact, he was so composed,
he turned off that belt sander

16:39.832 --> 16:43.403
moments before it plunged
onto my genitals.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.338
Your son.
Really?

16:45.405 --> 16:46.806
You must be very proud.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.808
**

16:48.875 --> 16:50.243
Stop right there.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.445
We need to talk.
Why?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.414
You heard the guy...
I'm his star student.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.915
He was Donald Ducking!

16:55.982 --> 16:57.550
If you don't laugh
at a Donald Ducking,

16:57.617 --> 16:59.319
then we got
a big problem. Big.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.888
You're the one who told me
I needed to focus on school

17:01.954 --> 17:03.990
to get a normal job.
That's what I'm doing.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.059
I just wanted you to be
a little more realistic.

17:06.126 --> 17:10.097
You told me I'd never
make it in any form
of entertainment...

17:10.163 --> 17:11.364
Not even puppetry.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.133
I think we both know
there's no money in puppets.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.534
That's not the point!

17:14.601 --> 17:17.404
I'm not good at sports
or science or math

17:17.470 --> 17:19.139
or stupid woodworking!

17:19.206 --> 17:22.309
But making people laugh
was the one thing
I thought I could do.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.678
Adam...
No, I get it now.
You were right.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.081
All I'll ever be
is just a Goldberg.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.817
**

17:35.888 --> 17:38.225
ADULT ADAM: With my mom gone,
Erica could finally

17:38.291 --> 17:40.059
enjoy her new,
sophisticated music...

17:41.594 --> 17:43.029
...if you could
call it that.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.897
It says this piece
is about Nixon.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.299
That was
my first thought.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.635
It's so very haunting
and painful.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.338
True. It's...
So painful.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.473
I can feel the music
banging in my head

17:53.540 --> 17:55.242
and rattling
my teeth and gums.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.911
That's how you know
it's good.

17:58.978 --> 18:02.115
I really love
how the bagpipes blend
horribly with the gonging

18:02.182 --> 18:04.351
and the off-putting
bird noises...

18:04.417 --> 18:06.153
And I just can't do it!
This is the worst!

18:06.219 --> 18:08.054
Shh!
Quiet down.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.422
This isn't
The Hooters concert.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.091
Yeah, 'cause God forbid
we listen to some catchy tunes

18:12.159 --> 18:13.860
that you can sing
and dance to.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.228
God, when is this over?

18:15.295 --> 18:17.029
We have, like,
three hours left.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.865
Three hours?

18:18.931 --> 18:22.034
I ditched my boyfriend
and awesome band for this...

18:22.101 --> 18:24.204
Avant garbage?
I got to go.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.939
**

18:28.175 --> 18:29.376
Hi. Excuse me.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.744
Have you seen a young man
in a semi-silk jacket

18:31.811 --> 18:34.214
with an older lady
who looks like a villain
in a soap opera?

18:34.281 --> 18:36.115
You're literally describing
everyone here.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.185
(THE HOOTERS'
"AND WE DANCED" PLAYS)

18:40.019 --> 18:41.354
They're gone.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.225
Erica?

18:45.292 --> 18:47.059
Oh, thank God
you're still here.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.361
Why are you
missing the show?

18:48.428 --> 18:49.962
The bagpipe solo's
about to start.

18:50.029 --> 18:54.133
Listen, I wanted to be
more than just a girl
from Jenkintown.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.536
The truth is, I love my town,

18:57.837 --> 18:59.105
and all the things in it.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.974
I live in Jenkintown.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.477
Do you, now?

19:04.544 --> 19:07.580
She's back. My normal,
beautiful baby is back.
* She was a bebop baby

19:07.647 --> 19:08.748
Mom!
* On a hard day's night

19:08.815 --> 19:10.750
No. You can't take it back.
You said you love us.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.585
I really do.
God help me.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.187
* There was no use talking
There was nothing to say

19:14.254 --> 19:15.722
Anyway, what do you say
we head back to Philly

19:15.788 --> 19:18.024
and grab a wudder ice?
* When the band
began to play and play

19:18.090 --> 19:19.492
Actually...
I have a better idea.

19:19.559 --> 19:23.963
* And we danced, like a wave
on the ocean, romanced

19:24.030 --> 19:27.133
* We were liars in love
and we danced

19:27.200 --> 19:28.968
* Swept away for a moment
by chance

19:29.035 --> 19:31.137
ADULT ADAM: That night,
Erica learned that
you don't have to give up

19:31.204 --> 19:32.472
where you're from
in order to grow

19:32.539 --> 19:34.407
into the kind of person
you always wanted to be.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.643
* And danced and danced and
danced and danced and danced

19:36.709 --> 19:38.378
Hey.

19:38.445 --> 19:40.213
* And we danced
I rented Stripes. I know
how you love that movie.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.350
* Like a wave on the ocean,
romanced *
I'm... Not feeling it.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.752
* We were liars in love,
and we danced
Okay.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.254
There's something
you should know.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.756
* Swept away for a moment
by chance
You really are funny.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.090
* And we danced
and danced and danced
Stop.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.560
No, it's the truth.
I just didn't want
to encourage you.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.695
So, you were
just trying to

19:55.762 --> 19:56.996
scare me away from it all?

19:57.063 --> 19:59.432
I was, and I'm sorry.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.067
Wow.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.002
Never heard you say
"sorry" before.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.372
Look, I always thought
I'd be the kind of dad

20:05.438 --> 20:07.474
who would help guide you
with your career.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.041
But all those things
that you love,

20:09.108 --> 20:10.377
they make me
feel helpless.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.313
Why?
I sell furniture, Adam.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.482
I don't know anything
about movies or comedy

20:15.548 --> 20:18.485
or magic or puppets.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.921
Point is, I don't get
any of your crazy dreams.

20:21.988 --> 20:26.058
I really don't. But if that's
what you really want,

20:26.125 --> 20:27.560
I'm in.
* We were liars in love,
and we danced

20:27.627 --> 20:29.962
* Swept away for a moment
by chance
That's...

20:30.029 --> 20:31.964
Thank you.
* And we danced
and danced and danced

20:32.031 --> 20:33.866
Just... Thank you.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.035
* Yeah

20:36.102 --> 20:38.237
Hey, Dad?

20:38.305 --> 20:40.072
* And we danced
What do you call a cow
with no legs?

20:40.139 --> 20:41.207
Ground beef.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.775
Here's a little tip...

20:42.842 --> 20:44.877
Don't ever do that joke
in public.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.514
**

20:47.580 --> 20:50.116
Um, what do you call
a cow with no legs?

20:50.182 --> 20:51.551
Ground beef!

20:54.153 --> 20:55.888
Do any of you
like impressions?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.526
Damn. I got to learn
some impressions.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.867
Okay, I got you the fancy
rich-people food you wanted,

21:07.934 --> 21:11.471
but I... I just don't think...
This is my new way of living.

21:11.538 --> 21:12.772
Bring me
my first course.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.941
I present to you... Pate.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.876
Like a hamburger pat

21:16.943 --> 21:18.010
Yes!

21:19.346 --> 21:21.348
No! Ugh!

21:21.414 --> 21:24.283
It's like meat,
but it's smooth
like peanut butter!

21:24.351 --> 21:27.520
Come on. Let mama make you
a shrimp parm and
a chili pot pie.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.957
Yes! Let's cheese up
some shrimps and pie up
some chili!
