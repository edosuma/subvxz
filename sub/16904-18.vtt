WEBVTT

00:02.472 --> 00:04.406
Hey, Jack...
The vending machine is broken!

00:04.872 --> 00:06.705
I know... I broke it.
I needed to speak with you,

00:06.774 --> 00:09.142
and I knew that was the fastest
way to get you up here.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.012
You bastard!
I trusted you!

00:11.079 --> 00:14.647
Lemon... Lemon!

00:14.715 --> 00:16.516
Is there any news
about Tracy?

00:16.567 --> 00:18.235
As of this morning,
he was still

00:18.302 --> 00:19.853
saving lives in Africa.

00:19.821 --> 00:22.022
I'm doing God's work
here in Africa.

00:22.073 --> 00:23.190
Why, just yesterday,

00:23.241 --> 00:24.925
I kicked two naked people
out of a garden.

00:24.993 --> 00:27.828
- But Tracy, we need you here.
- Simba Rafiki!

00:27.896 --> 00:29.530
Click, click, click.
Yeah, that's right.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.965
I just put you
in your place in African.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.701
<i>TGS with Tracy Jordan
without Tracy Jordan</i>

00:34.769 --> 00:37.204
is an oxymoron...
like "liberal government"

00:37.272 --> 00:38.238
or "female scientist."

00:38.306 --> 00:39.907
Or "Princeton football."

00:39.974 --> 00:42.409
We were 4 and 3
in Ivy league play last year.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.711
Our quarterback,
Henry Chang...

00:44.779 --> 00:46.280
it doesn't matter.
The point is

00:46.347 --> 00:49.333
that without Tracy,
<i>TGS</i> is going on...

00:49.417 --> 00:51.151
A forced hiatus.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.220
Forced hiatus?
Okay.

00:53.288 --> 00:55.622
So what should I tell
the troops?

00:55.690 --> 00:57.691
It's simple.
Sit them down individually.

00:57.759 --> 00:59.977
Tell them the network
still supports the show

01:00.061 --> 01:01.395
and that this is temporary.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.930
But you're lookin' out
for us, right?

01:02.997 --> 01:05.015
Pounding on desks and...

01:05.099 --> 01:06.516
Doing whatever this is called.

01:06.601 --> 01:08.902
Power wagging.
And I'm doing what I can.

01:08.970 --> 01:10.804
But I spent a lot
of political capital

01:10.872 --> 01:12.539
buying a new network
for Kabletown.

01:12.607 --> 01:13.774
Is it TNT?
Are <i>Rizzoli and Isles</i>

01:13.841 --> 01:14.775
friends in real life?

01:14.842 --> 01:16.610
It's a small cable network

01:16.678 --> 01:18.712
targeted towards
gay male viewers.

01:18.780 --> 01:20.547
It's called <i>Twinks</i>.

01:20.615 --> 01:21.715
That's the name
of your network?

01:21.783 --> 01:23.083
Isn't twink a term

01:23.151 --> 01:24.501
for a young,
hairless gay man?

01:24.586 --> 01:26.353
Nonsense.
Twinks is an acronym

01:26.421 --> 01:28.689
designed to project
a positive gay image.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.024
"Twinks... Television
with individuals...

01:31.092 --> 01:33.493
naive, kinky, shaved."
Okay.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.463
If the network were thriving,
it would be one thing.

01:36.531 --> 01:39.049
But my programming
has yet to find its footing.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.067
Uck. No!

01:40.134 --> 01:41.068
Next!

01:41.135 --> 01:43.704
Boring! Who?

01:43.771 --> 01:46.006
Twinks could be
extremely lucrative.

01:46.074 --> 01:48.342
Advertisers covet
this demographic.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.510
When I was with D'Fwan
on <i>Queen of Jordan,</i>

01:50.561 --> 01:53.680
he spent $4,000
on chihuahua outfits

01:53.748 --> 01:55.716
for himself.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.918
Okay, well,
don't worry about <i>TGS.</i>

01:57.986 --> 02:00.454
I'll take care of
this hiatus thing myself.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.689
Thank you, Lemon.
I'd like to help.

02:02.757 --> 02:04.825
But <i>I'm afraid
my hands are tied...</i>

02:04.892 --> 02:07.027
Is the only show
anyone's watching on <i>Twinks</i>.

02:10.298 --> 02:18.238
<font color="#FF8C00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.983 --> 02:31.885
The important thing is this
forced hiatus is only temporary.

02:31.953 --> 02:33.253
We'll be back
before you know it.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.455
Sidney, it's Frank.
<i>TGS</i> is dead.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.057
Start booking me
stand-up gigs.

02:37.125 --> 02:39.559
How many black women's colleges
are there in the country?

02:39.610 --> 02:41.294
- What are you doing?
- You just said

02:41.362 --> 02:42.596
we're going on
a forced hiatus.

02:42.664 --> 02:45.132
I know what that means...
time for Plan "B".

02:45.199 --> 02:47.000
Harriet Tubman
School of Nursing?

02:47.068 --> 02:49.169
Yes and yes!

02:49.236 --> 02:51.705
Well, good thing I kept
my teaching certificate

02:51.773 --> 02:53.273
so I can still sub.
Last time I taught,

02:53.341 --> 02:55.509
I was like Robin Williams
in <i>Dead Poets Society...</i>

02:55.576 --> 02:57.177
- By which I mean I got fired.
- No, Pete.

02:57.244 --> 03:02.616
This is only temporary.

03:02.684 --> 03:04.751
Thanks for
telling me, Liz.

03:04.819 --> 03:07.254
- We'll get through this.
- Oh, thank you!

03:07.321 --> 03:09.056
Finally,
someone with some faith!

03:09.123 --> 03:10.423
No.

03:10.475 --> 03:13.293
I meant my Jennababies
and I will get through this.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.495
I've been selling these
on QVC for years.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.530
It's my plan "B".

03:16.597 --> 03:18.465
This is Asian Jennababy.

03:18.533 --> 03:19.900
Excuse me, G.I.,

03:19.967 --> 03:21.201
do you miss your girlfriend?

03:21.269 --> 03:22.202
I'm good at math.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.272
So it's not offensive.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.240
Where you going... it's just
until Tracy comes back.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.276
I'm going back
to the job I had in Holland...

03:29.343 --> 03:30.277
police psychic.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.479
A Dutch TV show is based on me.

03:47.195 --> 03:48.461
Come on, Sue.

03:48.513 --> 03:50.063
You can't just leave me here
with toofer.

03:50.131 --> 03:52.065
Actually, I'm off, Liz.

03:52.133 --> 03:53.500
With my degree,
I can always go into

03:53.568 --> 03:56.636
Architecture
or Medical nanotechnology...

03:56.704 --> 03:57.838
Wait. What did you
major in?

03:57.905 --> 03:59.372
Sorry. I don't understand.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.907
Oh... I see.

04:00.975 --> 04:03.310
At Harvard,
we call them concentrations.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.545
Ugh!

04:05.613 --> 04:06.780
You're my last hope.

04:06.848 --> 04:09.649
Please tell me
you know this is temporary.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.151
Of course it is.

04:11.219 --> 04:13.687
'Cause I'm gonna find a way
to save the show.

04:13.755 --> 04:16.488
Let me just take out
my idea journal.

04:16.541 --> 04:17.591
Hmm.

04:17.658 --> 04:21.711
This just says
bird Internet.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.098
He said forced hiatus?

04:25.166 --> 04:26.633
Oh, man.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.568
- That's bad.
- Simon, you're my agent.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.520
You're not supposed to panic.
You're supposed to help me.

04:30.605 --> 04:33.073
Like how Fredward
helps out <i>iCarly.</i>

04:33.141 --> 04:35.008
No! Listen, everyone here
has a plan "B".

04:35.076 --> 04:37.077
If there's a real chance
that <i>TGS</i> could go away,

04:37.145 --> 04:38.545
what is my backup?

04:38.613 --> 04:40.714
Maybe something
with vampires.

04:40.782 --> 04:42.415
'Cause everything
has vampires nowadays.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.184
Have you seen the <i>Twilight
movies or Vampires Diaries?</i>

04:44.252 --> 04:45.385
I'm not allowed to.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.753
You need to get me
some meetings.

04:46.821 --> 04:49.522
Would you
be willing to come in

04:49.574 --> 04:51.224
for an Alpo commercial?

04:51.292 --> 04:52.926
If you can get through
the audition without pooping,

04:52.994 --> 04:54.694
it's yours.

04:54.762 --> 04:58.231
I'm a human writer, Simon.
Find me a writing job.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.801
So, Jack,
how's the baby?

05:00.868 --> 05:02.369
Baby...
Ah, yes!

05:02.436 --> 05:05.539
Baby...
Black-Asian bisexual youths.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.807
Those are viewers we want,

05:06.874 --> 05:08.775
and <i>Twinks</i>
is gonna bring them in.

05:08.843 --> 05:10.544
It's not a business
question, Jack.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.912
I mean your baby.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.713
- Your daughter.
- Oh!

05:13.781 --> 05:16.716
Of course,
uh, Liddy, she is adorable.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.085
My night nurse
swears she calls me <i>koskel,</i>

05:19.153 --> 05:22.622
which in Trinidadian creole
means stranger.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.357
Don't let work
be everything, Jack.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.426
Family's just as important

05:26.494 --> 05:28.428
as fixing that fellas
that like fellas network

05:28.496 --> 05:29.763
you talked me into buying.

05:29.831 --> 05:31.131
- I'm on top of that.
- Are you?

05:31.199 --> 05:33.600
Jack, there's lots
of things I like...

05:33.668 --> 05:36.469
fishing, Marches by
John Philip sousa,

05:36.537 --> 05:38.238
telephones
that look like footballs.

05:38.306 --> 05:39.940
But there's one thing
I don't like...

05:40.007 --> 05:41.274
losing money.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.210
Now, I don't know if my tone
is conveying

05:43.277 --> 05:44.578
the fury I feel about this,

05:44.645 --> 05:46.580
but I am, pardon my French,

05:46.647 --> 05:48.481
<i>bonjour!</i>

05:52.386 --> 05:54.588
Now, that's a joke,
but I am really, really mad.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.657
Look, Hank, I'm already
working on fixing <i>Twinks</i>.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.627
I'm remaking <i>Knight Rider</i>
with the Oscar meyer wienermobile.

06:00.695 --> 06:02.362
It's okay, Jack.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.130
You made a bad decision
and bought something

06:04.198 --> 06:05.498
you didn't understand,

06:05.566 --> 06:07.567
like when I bought tickets
for <i>Black Swan.</i>

06:07.635 --> 06:09.669
Remember when a movie was just
a fellow with a hat

06:09.737 --> 06:11.872
runnin' away from
a fellow with no hair?

06:11.939 --> 06:14.174
- No.
- The point is...

06:14.242 --> 06:15.375
You failed.

06:15.443 --> 06:18.178
But unless there's
a gay Jack Donaghy

06:18.246 --> 06:20.914
locked up somewhere
who understands all this stuff,

06:20.982 --> 06:24.684
let's just chalk this one up
to never again...

06:24.752 --> 06:26.686
And enjoy our lunch.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.989
Hank...

06:29.056 --> 06:30.790
There is a gay Jack Donaghy.

06:32.894 --> 06:34.895
His name is Devin Banks.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.863
Are you okay?

06:36.931 --> 06:38.865
I sense something...

06:38.933 --> 06:41.001
A presence I've not felt
since...

06:46.010 --> 06:47.100
Lemon!

06:48.310 --> 06:49.700
I decided to hire...

06:50.460 --> 06:53.195
- Devin banks.
- Banks? But he's your Nemesis.

06:53.263 --> 06:54.597
That would be like me
hiring that mouse

06:54.665 --> 06:56.332
that keeps pooping
in my slippers.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.367
Devin is the perfect man
to fix <i>Twinks</i>.

06:58.435 --> 07:00.269
He's a gay shark,
like the actor who played jaws.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.271
But he's gonna come in
and try to ruin everything,

07:02.339 --> 07:04.206
and everything
is already ruining itself.

07:04.574 --> 07:05.508
Not this time.

07:05.575 --> 07:08.444
Banks put all of his eggs
in the Obama basket.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.112
When the administration
started to falter

07:10.180 --> 07:12.248
because of our conspiracy...

07:12.315 --> 07:14.550
I mean, Obama's ineptitude,

07:14.618 --> 07:17.403
he tried to distance himself
publicly from, uh,

07:17.487 --> 07:19.455
your president.

07:19.523 --> 07:20.956
The recession
we're emerging from

07:21.024 --> 07:23.259
was primarily caused by
lack of responsibility

07:23.326 --> 07:24.393
and accountability.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.762
Then he tried to rejoin
us capitalists,

07:26.830 --> 07:29.598
showed up at John Paulson's
sweet 16 billion party.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.901
Nobody would talk to him.
Not even Ira.

07:31.968 --> 07:33.836
Then he was all, "Oh, I'll just
look at these books,"

07:33.904 --> 07:35.638
then pretended to
get a text and left,

07:35.706 --> 07:37.606
and we were all like
"Whatever. We'll go to IHOP.

07:37.674 --> 07:38.874
"And not tell him."

07:38.942 --> 07:40.376
- Where is he now?
- I tracked him down

07:40.444 --> 07:42.078
to an address in Brooklyn.

07:42.145 --> 07:43.913
He's on Linkedin, Lemon.

07:43.980 --> 07:46.098
He might as well be dead!

07:46.183 --> 07:47.416
So I throw him a lifeline,

07:47.484 --> 07:50.853
and he comes crawling back
like a, uh...

07:51.921 --> 07:52.521
Crab, I guess.

07:52.589 --> 07:53.689
What else crawls, Lemon?

07:53.757 --> 07:55.891
Babies, Jack.
You have one.

07:55.959 --> 07:57.727
Hank Hooper
is a traditionalist.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.094
He had his first heart attack

07:59.146 --> 08:00.730
when he saw pineapple
on a pizza.

08:00.781 --> 08:03.532
He'll hate Banks
and his hairless nostrils.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.668
And men should have
nose hairs.

08:05.736 --> 08:06.936
Hooper will hate Devin,

08:07.003 --> 08:08.454
and he'll never be able
to go over your head.

08:08.538 --> 08:10.906
Exactly. I'll pay him
for his ideas and, uh,

08:10.974 --> 08:12.475
kick him out the door.

08:12.542 --> 08:14.210
Speaking of TV ideas,

08:14.277 --> 08:16.746
would you buy a show about
a girl television writer

08:16.797 --> 08:19.315
trying to have it all
in the city

08:19.382 --> 08:21.617
and... also,
she's a vampire, I guess?

08:21.685 --> 08:22.918
I like the end part.

08:22.986 --> 08:24.470
Lemon, why do you have
a blank note pad

08:24.554 --> 08:25.788
with "Plan B" written on it?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.323
Because I'm freaking out.

08:27.390 --> 08:29.475
I told everyone
about the forced hiatus...

08:29.559 --> 08:31.393
Wait.
You said "forced hiatus"?

08:31.461 --> 08:34.163
Yeah. I didn't know
it was code for canceled.

08:34.231 --> 08:35.563
I thought
we understood each other.

08:35.631 --> 08:37.032
I thought we understood

08:37.100 --> 08:39.168
that you are never to think
that I understand anything!

08:39.236 --> 08:40.770
And you have no Plan "B"?

08:40.837 --> 08:42.738
I've been telling you to
prepare for the end of <i>TGS</i>

08:42.806 --> 08:44.774
for the last two years.

08:44.841 --> 08:46.659
Well, there have been a lot
<i>Amazing Races</i> on since then,

08:46.743 --> 08:48.577
and I had to watch them and
go online and comment on them.

08:48.645 --> 08:50.513
Here are your options...
you can go to L.A.

08:50.580 --> 08:52.314
I've been to L.A. once.

08:52.382 --> 08:54.116
Olive just turns into Barham?

08:54.184 --> 08:56.519
- Justice for Rodney King!
- How do I get to 10?

08:56.586 --> 08:57.837
It's <i>The</i> 10!

08:58.922 --> 09:00.156
Rodney King!

09:00.223 --> 09:01.724
You can't afford to be
selective.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.026
Opportunities for writers
are fewer and farther between.

09:04.094 --> 09:06.195
What about opportunities
for storytellers?

09:06.263 --> 09:08.497
Beginning with the cave
paintings of Lascaux, mankind...

09:08.548 --> 09:11.167
I can get you a meeting with
Nick Lachey for <i>The Sing-Off.</i>

09:11.234 --> 09:12.635
I'll take it!

09:15.438 --> 09:17.139
You here for
<i>the Sing-Off</i> gig?

09:17.207 --> 09:18.574
Yeah.

09:18.642 --> 09:19.809
Do I know you?

09:19.876 --> 09:22.211
You know my work.
Walk with me.

09:22.279 --> 09:24.814
I'm Aaron Sorkin.
<i>The West Wing, A Few Good Men,</i>

09:24.865 --> 09:25.898
<i>Social Network.</i>

09:25.982 --> 09:27.366
<i>Studio 60?</i>
Shut up.

09:27.450 --> 09:28.734
Do you know Nick Lachey?

09:28.819 --> 09:30.069
I hear he doesn't even
let you sit in the meeting.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.687
He just screams at you
to see how you react.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.622
Wait, you're not really
applying for this job, are you?

09:33.690 --> 09:35.524
Of course I am. You gotta
take work where you can find it.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.693
Especially now.
Our craft is dying

09:37.761 --> 09:38.878
while people
are playing <i>Angry Birds</i>

09:38.962 --> 09:40.546
and poking each other
on Facebook.

09:40.630 --> 09:42.298
What is poking, anyway?
Why won't anybody do it to me?

09:42.365 --> 09:43.499
I'm cool!

09:43.550 --> 09:44.867
So it's really
that bad out there.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.035
I mean, you're Aaron Sorkin.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.722
Speaking og <i>Angry Birds,</i>
Xdo you know how to beat <i>11-4?</i>

09:49.806 --> 09:51.090
It's just a red guy
and a green guy.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.475
The key is do not use
the green guy as a boomerang.

09:53.543 --> 09:55.544
- Did we just go in a circle?
- Listen, lady...

09:55.595 --> 09:57.813
a gender I write extremely well
if the story calls for it...

09:57.881 --> 09:58.914
this is serious!

09:58.982 --> 10:00.182
We make horse buggies

10:00.250 --> 10:02.084
and the first Model T
just rolled into town.

10:02.152 --> 10:04.019
- We're dinosaurs.
- We don't need two metaphors.

10:04.087 --> 10:06.322
That's bad writing.
Not that it matters.

10:06.389 --> 10:08.858
Mr. Sorkin,
Mr. Lachey will see you now.

10:10.794 --> 10:12.394
Mr. Lachey, huge fan.

10:12.462 --> 10:14.530
Huge fan.
I have all your albums.

10:17.734 --> 10:20.369
Oh. You'll be proud of me,
Miss Lemon.

10:20.437 --> 10:23.339
It is not easy coming up
with ideas to save the show.

10:23.406 --> 10:25.407
But this morning,
I held up this sign

10:25.458 --> 10:28.043
in the <i>Today Show</i> window.

10:28.111 --> 10:30.379
Now, I'm just waitin'
for the phone to ring.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.415
Kenneth, you may not be able
to save the show.

10:33.483 --> 10:34.750
If you wanna save
this dumb show,

10:34.818 --> 10:36.785
you gotta get the fans
involved.

10:36.853 --> 10:39.188
You know, like sometimes
people mail stuff to networks

10:39.256 --> 10:40.756
to show how passionate
they are.

10:40.824 --> 10:43.893
They sent light bulbs
to save <i>Friday Night Lights,</i>

10:43.960 --> 10:45.594
hot sauce to save <i>Roswell,</i>

10:45.645 --> 10:47.863
and douche bags
to save <i>Entourage.</i>

10:47.931 --> 10:50.199
Okay. So we just need
to think of something

10:50.267 --> 10:54.536
that fans can send
to Hank Hooper that says <i>TGS.</i>

10:54.604 --> 10:56.772
Something like...

10:58.775 --> 11:00.876
Bird Internet!

11:02.746 --> 11:04.947
It's about time, Cashmere.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.082
<i>Did you find Chana's boppy?</i>

11:07.150 --> 11:09.919
Was it at...
Music adventures?

11:09.986 --> 11:13.288
Banks...
What's become of you?

11:13.340 --> 11:14.757
Nothing!

11:16.526 --> 11:20.596
These aren't babies.
They're organ farms.

11:20.664 --> 11:22.331
Don't... look at me!

11:22.399 --> 11:23.599
Devin...

11:23.650 --> 11:25.668
Explain the gaybies.

11:25.735 --> 11:28.437
I'm a househusband now.
Happy?

11:28.505 --> 11:30.406
I married a shiny black
dancer named Cashmere,

11:30.473 --> 11:31.740
and we mixed our sperm
together

11:31.808 --> 11:35.477
so no one would know
whose baby is whose.

11:35.545 --> 11:39.281
Now... have you had your fun
looking at the freak?

11:39.349 --> 11:40.983
I'm here to offer
an olive branch.

11:41.051 --> 11:42.368
I'm working
with Kabletown now,

11:42.452 --> 11:44.320
and we've acquired
a network called <i>Twinks</i>.

11:44.387 --> 11:47.122
I could use someone on it
full-time, a subordinate.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.329
You came all the way
out here to Brooklyn

11:53.396 --> 11:56.298
to offer me, Banks, a job?

11:56.366 --> 11:59.001
You must be desperate, Jack.

11:59.069 --> 12:02.304
Twinks must be exploding,
and not in a good way.

12:02.372 --> 12:04.206
You thought
that I would lick your boots,

12:04.274 --> 12:05.774
but you need me.

12:05.842 --> 12:08.811
So now I'm gonna make you
let me lick your boots.

12:08.878 --> 12:10.145
I'll keep you
on a very tight leash.

12:10.213 --> 12:11.547
- Fantastic. Continue.
- I will not

12:11.614 --> 12:13.148
gay set you up again,
so I'll be very clear.

12:13.216 --> 12:14.450
You'll be under me,

12:14.517 --> 12:16.285
and if there's one slip-up,
your ass is mine.

12:18.188 --> 12:21.123
You couldn't resist coming
to see how far I'd fallen.

12:21.191 --> 12:22.491
But that was your mistake.

12:22.559 --> 12:25.828
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out.

12:25.895 --> 12:27.429
No. You are the spider.
I am the sun.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.914
I dry up all the rain.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.166
Yes! Freeing me, the spider,
to climb up the spout again!

12:31.234 --> 12:33.068
You bastard.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.941
Now... Who wants
some num-nums?

12:42.822 --> 12:44.541
Hey, Simon...
what's up?

12:45.179 --> 12:47.480
Any word from <i>The Sing-Off?</i>

12:47.565 --> 12:48.698
It's a pass.

12:48.766 --> 12:51.468
But Lachey hated you.

12:51.535 --> 12:53.503
- So what now?
- You're fired.

12:53.571 --> 12:55.505
- What?
- You're fired.

12:55.573 --> 12:57.874
Are you dropping me
as a client?

12:57.942 --> 12:59.709
What am I gonna do?

12:59.777 --> 13:02.379
Jack can't help me.
You don't want me as a client.

13:02.446 --> 13:04.197
I have no other skills.

13:04.281 --> 13:06.816
Liz, I'm gonna tell you
what I tell my dog clients

13:06.884 --> 13:08.151
when I drop them...
Chuh, chuh!

13:08.202 --> 13:09.152
Chuh, chuh, chuh!

13:09.203 --> 13:10.687
- Simon...
- Chuh!

13:10.755 --> 13:13.023
Chuh, chuh.

13:18.596 --> 13:20.697
Jack. We've been waiting
almost an hour

13:20.765 --> 13:22.148
for this Banks fellow.

13:22.216 --> 13:23.883
The only explanation
I can think of

13:23.951 --> 13:26.119
is that he keeps stopping
to perform good deeds.

13:26.187 --> 13:28.138
No, he's pulling a power play,
right out of the gate.

13:28.205 --> 13:29.372
He's making us wait

13:29.440 --> 13:31.858
so it looks like I have
no authority over him.

13:31.942 --> 13:33.710
Well, I'm
a straight shooter, Jack.

13:33.778 --> 13:35.645
Except at the urinal,
but that's just a little

13:35.713 --> 13:37.514
shrapnel side effect
from Vietnam.

13:37.581 --> 13:39.149
So when it comes to business...

13:39.216 --> 13:42.218
I don't like
these kinds of games.

13:42.286 --> 13:45.255
Boy, I hope my tone
is conveying how annoyed I am.

13:45.322 --> 13:46.890
You should be annoyed, Hank,
of course.

13:46.957 --> 13:48.825
Devin's crude attempts
at manipulation

13:48.876 --> 13:50.860
don't work
with a man like you.

13:50.928 --> 13:53.096
Banks is not a straight
shooter like you and me.

13:53.164 --> 13:54.831
For now... we need him.

13:54.882 --> 13:56.499
But as soon as he stops
being useful...

13:56.550 --> 13:57.867
We throw him in a ditch.

13:57.935 --> 14:00.203
My apologies, gentlemen.

14:00.254 --> 14:01.538
I tried to call,

14:01.605 --> 14:03.907
but somebody spilled milky
all over daddy's phoney.

14:03.974 --> 14:05.675
Didn't you,
little Mykonos?

14:05.743 --> 14:08.011
You brought a baby
to a business meeting.

14:08.062 --> 14:10.780
I'm so sorry, but this
little guy's really sick.

14:10.848 --> 14:12.582
He threw up
all over my jacket,

14:12.650 --> 14:14.067
and I just couldn't
leave him, but...

14:14.151 --> 14:16.953
Of course, I didn't want to miss
this fabulous opportunity.

14:17.021 --> 14:19.122
I'm always just trying to
balance work and family.

14:19.190 --> 14:20.857
It's kinda
what I'm all about.

14:20.925 --> 14:24.527
Well, son, you're gonna do
great here at Kabletown.

14:24.578 --> 14:25.628
Damn it!

14:25.696 --> 14:27.030
You know,
one of my grandchildren

14:27.098 --> 14:28.448
is just about the same age
as Mike here.

14:28.532 --> 14:30.633
- We should set up a playdate.
- How's tomorrow?

14:30.701 --> 14:33.303
Uh, Hank, could Devin and I
just have a moment, please?

14:33.370 --> 14:34.637
Of course!

14:34.705 --> 14:37.540
I'll just entertain
this little bundle of joy

14:37.608 --> 14:39.459
with one of my Uncle Hank
stories.

14:39.543 --> 14:42.445
The VC was everywhere.

14:42.513 --> 14:44.414
Yes, they were.
Yes, they were!

14:44.482 --> 14:47.050
This is a new low...
Even for you, Banks.

14:47.118 --> 14:49.586
Using your own baby
to get in with Hooper.

14:49.653 --> 14:51.321
I brought
the sexiest one, too.

14:51.388 --> 14:53.056
His cheekbones
are like granite.

14:53.124 --> 14:55.725
And old Hank the family man
fell right into my trap.

14:55.776 --> 14:58.995
This isn't even baby vomit
on my jacket.

14:59.063 --> 15:01.598
It's mine!
All mine.

15:01.665 --> 15:03.600
This... is not over.

15:03.667 --> 15:07.487
Oh, look how much
he just loves his Uncle Hank!

15:07.571 --> 15:08.988
Whoosh went the flamethrower.

15:09.073 --> 15:10.773
"Medic! Medic!"
Cried the wittle boy!

15:16.080 --> 15:18.414
Oh! How was substitute
teaching, sir?

15:18.466 --> 15:20.950
Oh, just like <i>Lean on Me...</i>
In that a guy

15:21.018 --> 15:22.652
who looks like Morgan Freeman
swung a bat at me.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.254
What are you doing
with those sugar cubes?

15:24.305 --> 15:27.423
Starting a fan mailing
campaign to save the show!

15:27.475 --> 15:30.493
People will send sugar cubes
to Hank Hooper

15:30.561 --> 15:32.512
to show that
they're sweet on <i>TGS.</i>

15:32.596 --> 15:34.647
I've already sent about
100 of these,

15:34.732 --> 15:36.465
even though licking
an envelope is a sin.

15:36.517 --> 15:38.635
Unless you're married to it.

15:38.702 --> 15:41.437
So I had to marry each envelope,
and then divorce it.

15:41.505 --> 15:42.939
Which brings me
to my ninth point...

15:42.990 --> 15:45.341
so you're putting
a sugar cube in an envelope

15:45.409 --> 15:47.343
and then mailing it
to Hank Hooper.

15:47.411 --> 15:48.511
But then when he opens it,

15:48.579 --> 15:50.013
it will have been crushed

15:50.080 --> 15:52.482
into a fine, white powder.

15:52.550 --> 15:53.816
I suppose so, sir.

15:53.868 --> 15:56.519
Kenneth, do you know
what Anthrax looks like?

15:56.587 --> 15:58.288
I'm not with him!

15:58.339 --> 15:59.322
God bless America!

15:59.373 --> 16:00.824
Aah!

16:00.891 --> 16:02.342
My thorax!

16:02.426 --> 16:04.294
We never could have
found him so quickly

16:04.345 --> 16:06.162
without your help.

16:06.213 --> 16:07.830
Thank you, mentaalist.

16:07.882 --> 16:11.668
It is a gift...
And a curse.

16:11.735 --> 16:12.902
In the TV show,

16:12.970 --> 16:15.839
you bang me in a tulip field
under credits.

16:23.847 --> 16:24.814
Mommy.

16:25.882 --> 16:26.549
What's that?

16:26.617 --> 16:28.351
It's a toilet.

16:28.419 --> 16:30.587
Or woman.
It's whatever you need it to be.

16:30.654 --> 16:34.057
No!
People of the sidewalk...

16:34.124 --> 16:36.159
We can't give up
on the written word!

16:36.210 --> 16:38.211
We need stories!

16:38.295 --> 16:40.530
Because I don't have
a Plan "B".

16:40.598 --> 16:44.033
I have a degree in theater tech
with a minor in movement.

16:44.101 --> 16:46.419
Why did my parents
let me do that?

16:46.503 --> 16:48.421
It's over.

16:48.505 --> 16:50.340
Who's there?
Show yourselves.

16:50.407 --> 16:51.875
You're one of us now.

16:53.344 --> 16:54.811
Who are you?

16:54.879 --> 16:56.813
Better to ask
who we used to be.

16:56.881 --> 16:59.115
People whose professions
are no longer a thing.

16:59.183 --> 17:01.784
Once...
I was called travel agent.

17:01.852 --> 17:03.453
I was an American
auto worker.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.021
And I played dynamite
saxophone solos

17:05.089 --> 17:06.856
in rock and roll songs.

17:06.924 --> 17:09.125
Come. We live under
the subways

17:09.193 --> 17:11.594
with the CEO of Friendster.

17:11.662 --> 17:14.364
No! <i>TGS</i> isn't dead yet!

17:17.768 --> 17:19.535
Morning, Jack.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.738
Oh, my.
Empty coffee pot.

17:21.805 --> 17:24.641
Same cheap $300 tie
as yesterday.

17:24.708 --> 17:25.875
Nose hair all askew?

17:25.925 --> 17:27.377
You've been here all night

17:27.428 --> 17:28.878
trying to figure out
how to fight back, haven't you?

17:28.946 --> 17:30.280
How was your playdate
with the Hoopers?

17:30.347 --> 17:31.447
Oh, it was amazing.

17:31.515 --> 17:33.433
He has really superlative
tummy-time.

17:33.517 --> 17:34.951
Oh! I almost forgot.

17:35.019 --> 17:37.587
Hank... Uncle Hank...
wants to expand overseas,

17:37.655 --> 17:40.423
and he's chosen me to be the
face of the company in Europe.

17:40.491 --> 17:42.825
That's right.
I've been promoted.

17:42.893 --> 17:44.110
But Europe is my purview.

17:44.194 --> 17:45.561
I was supposed to go there
next week.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.163
I was going to take a picture
where it looked like

17:47.231 --> 17:48.831
I was holding up
the Leaning Tower of Pisa!

17:48.899 --> 17:50.900
Now I'll be taking
that picture.

17:50.968 --> 17:53.469
Do you have idea
how strong I'll look?

17:53.537 --> 17:56.306
I vanquished you
in one day!

17:56.373 --> 17:57.640
I was trapped in a world

17:57.708 --> 17:59.909
of wet wipes
and rectal thermometers.

17:59.977 --> 18:01.995
Then the babies came,
and life changed.

18:02.079 --> 18:03.946
But you set me free, Jack.

18:03.998 --> 18:05.798
Now it's weekends in New York,

18:05.883 --> 18:08.751
then Jet-Setting around
the world in economy plus.

18:08.802 --> 18:11.804
I'll be thousands of miles away
from the chaos in Brooklyn.

18:11.889 --> 18:13.840
Do you know what it's like
to have triplets?

18:13.924 --> 18:15.341
It's just everything
times three.

18:15.426 --> 18:16.926
Three pairs of grabby
little hands

18:16.994 --> 18:19.812
smearing food all over your
brand-new chihuahua outfits.

18:19.897 --> 18:22.932
Three pairs of feet in their
weird, soft little shoes.

18:22.983 --> 18:25.535
Three Paris of eyes,
brown...

18:25.602 --> 18:27.503
Like my husband's.

18:27.571 --> 18:30.373
Three perfect little mouths...

18:30.441 --> 18:34.277
That smile every time
I walk through the door.

18:34.345 --> 18:36.112
Three tummies...

18:36.180 --> 18:39.015
That just want their num-nums
and zerberts.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.851
Oh, God, I just love
my gaybies too much.

18:41.919 --> 18:44.037
I can't leave!

18:44.121 --> 18:46.155
That's it?

18:46.223 --> 18:48.657
You're just going to talk
yourself out of it?

18:48.709 --> 18:49.876
I'm sorry, Jack.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.227
But I had stuff planned.

18:51.295 --> 18:52.729
I was going to
<i>Trading Places</i> you.

18:52.796 --> 18:55.965
I was bailed out of prison
and told to come up here.

18:56.033 --> 18:58.568
That was weak, Banks.

18:58.635 --> 18:59.969
I don't expect you
to understand.

19:00.037 --> 19:02.004
You don't know
what it's like to have kids.

19:02.056 --> 19:03.339
Actually, Devin, I do.

19:03.407 --> 19:05.308
I have a baby daughter,
Liddy.

19:05.376 --> 19:07.677
And yet you still managed
to be here all night

19:07.745 --> 19:09.479
trying to figure out
how to bring me down.

19:09.546 --> 19:11.864
Well, damn, Jack...

19:11.949 --> 19:13.149
You are strong.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.318
You're like Dora's friend...

19:15.386 --> 19:17.687
Benny the bull.

19:17.755 --> 19:18.854
Thank you.

19:22.092 --> 19:24.527
Jonathan, call my car.

19:36.774 --> 19:38.441
Okay. Here's an idea.

19:38.509 --> 19:40.977
We keep <i>TGS</i> going
as a Magazine.

19:41.044 --> 19:43.079
Miss Lemon, it's over.

19:43.147 --> 19:45.081
I applied
to transfer to News.

19:45.149 --> 19:47.683
I'm sorry.
I couldn't save the show.

19:47.735 --> 19:49.852
Here.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.021
I'm actually
not that hungry.

19:52.072 --> 19:53.356
That's funny.

19:53.424 --> 19:54.857
This is the same place
Mr. Jordan

19:54.925 --> 19:56.359
gets pizza from in Africa.

19:56.410 --> 19:57.726
I'm sorry, what?

19:57.778 --> 19:59.562
Oh, when Mr. Jordan and I
talk on the computer,

19:59.630 --> 20:02.031
sometimes he's eating
this exact same pizza.

20:02.082 --> 20:03.466
Africa's great.

20:03.534 --> 20:05.902
We got Juju monsters...

20:05.969 --> 20:07.353
Gum-gum trees...

20:07.421 --> 20:08.704
And horsicorns...

20:08.772 --> 20:11.274
Which is a unicorn
with a horse's head.

20:11.341 --> 20:14.210
Kenneth,
you beautiful goon!

20:14.261 --> 20:15.578
He's not in Africa.

20:15.646 --> 20:17.263
He's somewhere
in the delivery zone

20:17.347 --> 20:18.765
of Federici's Pizza!

20:18.849 --> 20:20.800
We can find him
and bring him back here,

20:20.884 --> 20:22.785
and no more forced hiatus!

20:22.853 --> 20:24.620
I did it!
I saved the show!

20:24.688 --> 20:26.122
I won't have to go work
at News!

20:26.190 --> 20:28.224
And I won't have to be
the world's worst hooker!

20:28.292 --> 20:29.592
You wanna party?

20:29.660 --> 20:32.728
It's 500 for kissing,
10,000 for snuggling.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.831
End of list.

20:34.898 --> 20:35.982
No!

20:37.117 --> 20:40.002
I'm <i>hungry</i> again!

20:46.001 --> 20:47.902
Have you made
friends in Africa?

20:47.950 --> 20:48.402
Oh sure!

20:48.404 --> 20:52.002
Ladysmith Black Mambazo,
Paul Simon and Victus.

20:52.401 --> 20:54.002
So, what's the weather like?

20:54.401 --> 20:56.102
Crazy! It's the snowiest winter

20:56.103 --> 20:59.102
we've had in years
in New York... in Africa.

20:59.303 --> 21:01.302
Well sir, I had a
very interesting morning

21:01.303 --> 21:02.602
Oh, oh. It's nighttime.

21:03.103 --> 21:05.602
Gotta go to bed, or I'll
anger the gods.

21:05.803 --> 21:08.602
They must be crazy!
Africa!

21:10.003 --> 21:13.012
I probably should have realized
he was in New York sooner.

21:14.803 --> 21:16.005
Bird Internet.
