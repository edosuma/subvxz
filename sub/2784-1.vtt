<i>He's a real hard worker

A lot a lot?

07:35.920 --> 07:37.843
Mm-hmm...

fucking tell me.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.928
Yeah, me too. We got to
cool it with that shit.

Yeah.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.000
We got a brand new life. Yeah.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.889
We're getting old.
No.

08:05.960 --> 08:06.882
Yeah. I mean kind of.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.849
I got a job.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.843
You did? Really?
Mm-hmm.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.331
What are you doing?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.846
I'm working
at a collection agency.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.287
That's very exciting.
Yeah.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.842
Hey, and if you want,
I can talk to my boss.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.491
His name
is Mr. Lovell,

08:23.560 --> 08:26.530
and he's real sweet,
you know?

08:26.600 --> 08:28.568
I don't really think
that's for me.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.085
No, baby. No.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.685
Well, why don't you
think about it?

08:31.760 --> 08:33.046
Well, I can think
about it.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.610
I mean, I thought
about it.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.761
And? I don't think it's for me.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.923
Ten years ago,
I was in your very shoes.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.366
Fresh off a stint
and looking for a new start.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.965
Wait, you did time?

08:44.039 --> 08:45.929
Seven months
at Otisville.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.446
It was actually one
of my better business ideas.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.205
What I'd do was I would send
out these fake invoices

08:51.280 --> 08:53.851
to all the big companies, and if
it was under a thousand bucks,

08:53.920 --> 08:55.604
they wouldn't
check them out.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.405
I netted 800 grand until
Uncle Sam caught me.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.641
That's genius.
Thank you.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.643
I feel small-time.

09:01.720 --> 09:04.200
But what I realized after I
paid my debt to society--

09:04.280 --> 09:07.250
You can't vote anymore.
One.

09:07.320 --> 09:11.882
Is that everyone
deserves a second chance.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.883
You know,
I always say that.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.769
Yeah. That's why I hire
ex-cons, like Rabies over here.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.251
<i>Hey, meet Tommy.
New guy.</i>

09:17.320 --> 09:19.322
Hey, what's up, man?

09:19.400 --> 09:22.449
Sex offender,
but actually a nice guy.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.488
So you
only hire ex-cons?

09:24.560 --> 09:27.723
Well, I hire people who have
been abandoned by society.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.768
Yeah.
By everyone but me.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.962
Yeah. There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.280
Yeah, I'm not ashamed.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.010
Oh, say it again.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.004
Say-- I'm not ashamed.
Yes, say it again.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.089
I'm not ashamed.
Louder.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.121
I'm not ashamed.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.406
Yes!

09:46.480 --> 09:48.881
I'm so proud of you.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.166

10:13.880 --> 10:16.121
I'm sitting here,
not so thrilled,

10:16.200 --> 10:18.521

What do you know about that?

[no audible dialog]

10:44.600 --> 10:47.080

10:49.000 --> 10:50.650
Rich people, you
know what they do.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.563
They pay lobbyists
to write the fucking laws.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.847
Let's--
Hey, let's cross.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.848
Why?

10:56.920 --> 10:58.763
What, for them?

10:58.840 --> 11:00.968
Tommy, in this neighborhood
you give those guys space.

was responsible.</i>

11:02.440 --> 11:04.329

11:04.400 --> 11:06.289
Bunch of greasy old guys
coasting on their reputations.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.523
Bullshit. They used to fuck
with my father every day.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.364
They would humiliate him

11:11.480 --> 11:13.721
because he borrowed money
to start his flower shop.

11:13.800 --> 11:17.521
They were all fucking rats.
Even before RICO.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.365
Who's RICO?

11:20.440 --> 11:23.410
If you see it, then you will...?

11:25.240 --> 11:27.368
Live it!
You will...?

11:27.440 --> 11:29.124
Buy it!
Be it.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.441
Be it! I was going
to say it.

11:31.520 --> 11:35.445
If you see it,
you will be it!

11:35.520 --> 11:39.366
If you see it, you will be it!
Yes! Be it!

11:39.400 --> 11:41.880
Yeah, look at that.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.088
Little miss pretty pants
in the front row.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.525
Are you calling me?
Yes, hello.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.800
How you feeling?
Good.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.086
What you got
going on?

11:48.160 --> 11:49.286
I'm ready to believe it.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.646
Believe it!

11:50.720 --> 11:51.926
Achieve it!
Achieve it!

11:52.000 --> 11:53.206
Succeed it.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.890
All right, take Tommy.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.490
Tommy baby,

11:56.560 --> 11:57.209

You look real good.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.204
Actually, how-how long
you been out?

12:47.280 --> 12:49.931
A little bit now.
Like a month, you know.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.365
I'm just--
I'm getting organized.

12:51.440 --> 12:55.445
So was it
a h-hard time, or...?

12:55.480 --> 12:58.689
<i>No time</i> is easy <i>time.
Yeah, sure.</i>

12:58.760 --> 13:03.971

13:04.040 --> 13:05.530
Uh, nah...

13:05.600 --> 13:07.284
She's not here?
Mm-mm.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.045
All right, because
I wanted to talk to her.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.691
All right, you'll tell her
I stopped by, right?

13:12.760 --> 13:15.001
Yeah, sure I'll do that. Look
at this, I've still got it.

13:15.080 --> 13:18.846
Hey, you know what? So I moving
in with my girlfriend, Rosie.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.922
That's good. I really
want you guys to meet.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.889
I was figuring that,
you know--

13:22.960 --> 13:25.486
I thought that maybe the three
of us could get a beer.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.688
Okay, yeah. Well, you know,
not now you know.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.240
It's just been crazy, crazy busy.
Crazy busy, yeah...

13:30.320 --> 13:33.244
Crazy, crazy busy.
Crazy.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.243
Yeah, well I didn't mean
like right now.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.243
No, sure. You know,
when you're free.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.641
Yeah.
Yeah,maybe.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.722
<i>Oh, Jesus.
What?</i>

13:41.840 --> 13:43.365
I haven't seen
this picture in so long.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.363
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

13:45.440 --> 13:47.249
<i>Oh, yeah... Look at that.
You remember that'?</i>

13:49.360 --> 13:54.161
<i>Yeah, yeah...</i>

13:54.240 --> 13:57.005
Well, you know,
things change.

13:57.040 --> 14:00.010
You know, Bobby,
I was thinking...

14:00.080 --> 14:02.003
You know, maybe
I could come back.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.726
Yeah? We could turn this
into something, you know?

14:05.800 --> 14:07.643
We could get it making
some money, I think.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.643
You know,
with some help.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.121
You know, I mean... yeah, I
could talk to Ma, you know.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.964
Would you talk to her?

14:14.080 --> 14:15.730
I mean ,I can't make any
promises, but you know--

14:15.800 --> 14:17.609
That'd be amazing if you
could talk-- Bobby?

14:17.680 --> 14:19.762
<i>I need you to recut these
and add some more--</i>

14:19.840 --> 14:22.411
Hey, Ma.
pink to them, please.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.289
And I need some help
in the back.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.722
Hey-- Ma, seriously?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.211
You're not even
going to say hello?

14:35.640 --> 14:37.847
Yeah. Hello.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.890
What do you need? Money?

14:40.920 --> 14:44.925
No, I-- I don't
need anything. I just--

14:45.000 --> 14:48.846
When do we see you,
huh, Tommy?

14:48.920 --> 14:51.161
Either you need bail
or you're in trouble.

14:51.240 --> 14:52.765
Come on, Ma.
Stop it.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.888
You come around
only when you need things

14:54.920 --> 14:57.491
and then you leave, and you go
on again, and it's bye-bye.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.642
And then I'm stuck here
every night wondering

14:59.720 --> 15:01.768
if the next time I see you,
I'm burying you.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.002
Don't say that.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.401
All right? I just-- Things are
going to be different, all right?

15:06.480 --> 15:08.164
I'm doing better.
I'm picking up the pieces.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.641
Go.
Ma?

15:10.760 --> 15:12.444
<i>Bobby, go back to work.
(Bobby) Okay.</i>

15:22.360 --> 15:25.443
You know next week, maybe we
could grab that beer. Yeah?

15:25.520 --> 15:29.809
Yeah. Yeah. I want to do
that, you know. Okay.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.360
You know, I want you
to meet Rosie.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.771
Yeah, Rosie. Yeah.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.287
We can start your payments
at 25 a month.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.408
Yeah. You're welcome.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.642
<i>(Tommy) You're dealing
with a bureaucracy, right.</i>

15:48.720 --> 15:50.882
<i>So you got to think
like a bureaucrat.</i>

15:50.960 --> 15:52.803
<i>I'm going to tell you what to do.
You listening to me?</i>

15:52.880 --> 15:54.086
You fill out the slip.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.810
Right? You send it in.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.644
But you don't put
any money inside, right?

15:57.720 --> 16:00.121
<i>Then you call,
and you raise hell.</i>

16:00.160 --> 16:02.481
"Yeah, I paid you. I paid you.
Don't you have the slip?"

16:02.560 --> 16:04.881
And they say, "Yes, we have
the slip but we don't--"

16:04.960 --> 16:06.962
And then you say,
"Well, you lost my check!"

16:07.040 --> 16:09.964
<i>I'm telling you, it's going
to buy you like six months.</i>

16:10.040 --> 16:10.802
<i>I'm serious.</i>

16:12.040 --> 16:13.849
Positive thinking!

16:53.040 --> 16:55.611
<i>[man] I can '1' believe
how old Bobby Pills got.</i>

16:55.680 --> 16:58.331
And he just walks in with the
houndstooth jacket and I'm like Jesus!

16:58.400 --> 17:00.721
That's not Bobby Pills, that's Tony.
That's Tony Caruso.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.041
- <i>That's Tony Caruso..</i>
- <i>Yeah, Tony's the snake.</i>

17:03.080 --> 17:05.651
He's always changing it. That's
why he got the nickname Slippery.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.801
They couldn't find him, ever.
Right.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.241
<i>When they'd finally tag him,
he'd have the perfect alibi.</i>

17:10.319 --> 17:12.607
<i>His wife got on the stand
and said,</i>

17:12.680 --> 17:14.762
<i>"Yeah, Tony couldn't have
whacked Jimmy</i>

17:14.839 --> 17:16.762
<i>"because every Friday night,
Tony's with his mistress."</i>

17:16.839 --> 17:19.080
And his wife <i>said</i> if? His
wife told them that, yeah.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.925
<i>All right, I'm going
to go back up.</i>

17:23.000 --> 17:26.482
<i>That man.
John Gem.</i>

17:26.560 --> 17:30.406
<i>I do what he says,
when he says.</i>

17:30.480 --> 17:33.962
<i>He tells me to jump,
I jump.</i>

17:34.040 --> 17:37.567
<i>It's always been that way.
He's the boss.</i>

17:37.600 --> 17:41.321
<i>[lawyer]
Now, by boss you mean--</i>

17:41.400 --> 17:44.927
The Skipper, the Chief,
the Capo-regime.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.804
<i>He's the boss
of the Gambino Family.</i>

17:46.880 --> 17:48.689
<i>And he told me
to take care of it.</i>

17:48.760 --> 17:50.444
<i>[lawyer]
Take care of it?</i>

17:50.520 --> 17:53.729
To whack. Ice him. Smoke him.
Get rid of him.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.241
<i>Kill him.</i>

17:56.320 --> 17:59.449
<i>[lawyer] Can you talk to me
about the night of August 20th?</i>

17:59.520 --> 18:01.329
<i>We was at a sitdown
at the Pizalo Club</i>

18:01.400 --> 18:03.164
<i>over on Union Avenue.</i>

18:03.240 --> 18:06.926
That's the Mafia Social Club
at 140 Union Avenue?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.923
<i>[lawyer 2]
Objection, Your Honor.</i>

18:08.960 --> 18:11.850
<i>Move to strike the word
'Mafia' from the record.</i>

18:11.920 --> 18:13.649
<i>There is no such thing
as a Mafia.</i>

18:13.720 --> 18:16.371
<i>It is just
an ugly ethnic stereotype.</i>

18:16.440 --> 18:18.727
<i>[judge]
Sustained.</i>

18:18.800 --> 18:21.201
<i>[lawyer 1] So at this social
club, you had your gun with you?</i>

18:21.280 --> 18:23.851
No. No guns in the club.
It's against the rules...

18:23.920 --> 18:27.208
Guns and wiseguys
is a bad mix.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.321
You'll love
the ocean view.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.483
<i>And you're going to have to put
down some big credit, too.</i>

18:50.560 --> 18:54.485
Like your life.
Don't fuck with me.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.721
<i>All right. Later.</i>

18:57.640 --> 18:59.608
Uh, is this the library?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.284
It's a private club.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.691
<i>Is there a library
on this block?</i>

19:02.760 --> 19:03.886
This is 140, right?

19:03.960 --> 19:05.166
140 Union?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.685
Get the fuck out of here.

19:06.760 --> 19:09.684
<i>Okay. All right.
All right.</i>

19:09.760 --> 19:13.242
<i>You think I can gez' a drink?
You have Campari?</i>

19:13.320 --> 19:15.004
Go on,
get the fuck out of here!

19:15.040 --> 19:16.644
Okay, I'm going
to get the fuck out of here.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.284
Fucking jerk off.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.644
Hey, baby.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.085
Hello, you don't just walk
out of your job

19:26.160 --> 19:27.446
whenever you feel like it.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.891
<i>"Rosie, do you need help?"</i>

19:28.960 --> 19:31.440
Can I help you, baby?
No.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.808
Did you get peanut butter?
Yeah.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.724
Where were you? I went to
one of those social clubs.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.564
Like a mafia social club?

19:39.640 --> 19:41.608
Yeah, the Italian social club
out on Union Avenue.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.809
I was curious, you know.
So I walked in.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.405
You know what
was going on in there?

19:46.480 --> 19:48.084
No.
Nothing.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.844
Nothing was going on.
Absolutely nothing.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.843
<i>A bunch of old guys
playing cards.</i>

19:51.960 --> 19:54.247
You know, there's no guns
allowed in those clubs.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.446
Did you know that?

19:55.520 --> 19:56.931
<i>Oh, yeah?
Yeah.</i>

19:57.000 --> 19:58.047
<i>Where did you
hear that?</i>

19:58.120 --> 19:59.963
At the Gotti trial.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.725
You went to the Gotti trial?
Yeah.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.167
When?
Before the social club.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.641
Now you're, like-- Now
you're freaking me out.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.722
What are you,
like a fucking groupie?

20:09.800 --> 20:11.040
You know Sammy the Bull?

20:11.120 --> 20:12.565
<i>No, I don't know Sammy.</i>

20:12.600 --> 20:14.250
<i>You know
Sammy the Bull.</i>

20:14.320 --> 20:16.243
Well, I saw Sammy the Bull
today, on trial.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.886
He was giving his testimony, right?
Sure.

20:18.960 --> 20:23.443
And he said that. He said,
"Wiseguys and guns is a bad mix.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.249
"No guns allowed
in the club."

20:25.320 --> 20:27.049
Yeah, because they're
actually social clubs,

20:27.160 --> 20:28.924
like they hang out
like they're normal people.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.889
Yeah, right. Like
they're normal people.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.645
They're not doing anything.
I got to thinking, baby like...

20:33.720 --> 20:37.441
when I walked in there, I mean,
wiseguys, they got cash.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.648
I mean, a lot of fucking
cash, right? Yeah.

20:39.720 --> 20:43.406
I could clean them out.
I mean, like, clean them out.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.010
No, no, no.
What?

20:45.080 --> 20:46.730
You're not serious, are you?
What?

20:46.800 --> 20:48.723
Please don't tell me
you're fucking serious.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.723
I'm just saying it's easy money.
I'm just saying, baby.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.406
Give me all your money! Give
me all your fucking money!

20:53.480 --> 20:54.845
Give me all your money!
Give--

That's me!
Thank you.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.804
Rabitz...

22:54.720 --> 22:56.245
We're going to have
to sell your car.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.322
My father gave me
that car.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.562
I am not selling
the car.

lam not going back
to my mother's!

Well, then we're going
to have to go to plan B.

23:06.160 --> 23:07.730
Okay, what's plan B?

23:07.800 --> 23:10.406
Plan B, baby.
Yes. Tell me.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.481
Listen,
just hear me out.

23:13.560 --> 23:17.087
Oh, no!
No. No.

23:17.120 --> 23:20.124
Honey, listen,
they're criminals.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.123
They're not going
to call the cops.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.929
And the cops aren't
going to fucking care

23:24.000 --> 23:26.924
if we rip off
some fucking wiseguys.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.810
Look, we get
in the car,

23:29.880 --> 23:31.484
you drive me to the
end of this corner,

23:31.560 --> 23:34.131
I run in, five minutes,
and then barn!

23:34.200 --> 23:36.771
We're outta there. What
happens if you go to jail?

23:36.840 --> 23:38.968
What do you mean? What are
you talking about jail?

23:39.040 --> 23:42.089
Who's going to jail? Who's going to jail?
I'm not going to jail.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.447
Okay. That's why this is good.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.205
All we need is a grand,
maybe 1500 bucks,

23:47.320 --> 23:48.924
and then we're over
this hump

23:49.000 --> 23:50.570
and then we can go back
to business as usual.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.802
What happens
if you get hurt?

23:52.880 --> 23:54.928
No one
is getting hurt.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.923
Nobody is going
to get hurt, baby.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.528
Hey, if you've got
a better idea,

24:01.600 --> 24:04.126
don't be quiet.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.531
I don't.
Look.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.171
All you got to do
is drive.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.526
That's all you
got to do.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.125
No one is going
to get hurt.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.122
Okay.
Yeah?

24:17.440 --> 24:18.646
All right.
Just relax.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.808
I been working on this.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.882
I said I'll think about it.
I'm not saying yes, though.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.921
What the fuck is that?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.365
Whoa, what?

24:28.440 --> 24:31.364
What is that?
Oh, my God!

24:31.440 --> 24:32.726
What? It's an eggplant.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.928
No, next
to the eggplant!

24:35.000 --> 24:36.764
Oh, shit,
I'm sorry.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.126
<i>I forgot</i> I <i>had this in there.
What is that?</i>

24:38.200 --> 24:39.850
It's-- listen.
Oh, my God!

24:39.920 --> 24:41.285
Overwhelming force.

24:41.360 --> 24:42.771
If it works
for the U.S. Army,

24:42.840 --> 24:44.171
it's going
to fucking work for us.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.129
Now please, I need
your help

24:46.200 --> 24:47.406
because I have no idea
how to use this thing.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.970
Don't bring it in here.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.883
You're better
with mechanics than me.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.564
I think I fucking broke it.
You turn it to the left.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.130
Turn what to the left?

24:54.200 --> 24:57.090
If you move this.
Hold it like that.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.161
Okay? What would I
do without you?

25:08.640 --> 25:11.086
(Tommy) Pull over. Pull over.
We just passed it.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.924
What are you doing? Pull over.
I can't do this.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.604
You can't--
you can't do what?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.125
I can't.
l cannot

25:16.240 --> 25:18.242
I cannot go back
to jail, Tommy.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.924
<i>I'm not going
back to jail either.</i>

25:20.000 --> 25:23.527
Rosie,
I need you, baby.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.285
<i>Just this one time,
like we talked about.</i>

25:26.360 --> 25:27.725
<i>Just to get ahead.</i>

25:31.200 --> 25:31.883
Make a U-ey.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.129
Those are
our new bed sheets.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.248
It's a pillowcase. Yeah,
but it's part of a set!

25:48.320 --> 25:50.084
I thought a trash bag
would rip.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.446
<i>Oh, God.</i>

25:59.440 --> 26:00.805
You mine?

26:00.880 --> 26:01.802
I'm yours.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.241
Tommy.
Yeah, baby.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.606
I love you.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.284
What--
Don't fucking say it!

26:12.360 --> 26:13.930
I told you it's-- Fine,
I don't love you.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.968
Shut the fuck up!
You shut the fuck up!

26:16.040 --> 26:18.008
Shut the fuck up, I swear to God.
Shut the fuck-- [yells]

26:18.080 --> 26:20.242
Shut the fuck up right now!
Stop it.

26:20.320 --> 26:24.882
Stop.
Put your hood on.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.361
Keep your eyes open.
Keep the car running.

26:48.640 --> 26:52.122
Can I help you?
Yeah. Yeah.

26:52.200 --> 26:55.283
Whoa, whoa,
are you fucking kidding me?

26:55.360 --> 26:56.691
All right,
this is a robbery.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.404
Hey, get the fuck
over there.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.130
Come on, come on!
Get the fuck over there.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.771
No one behind me,
all right?

27:02.840 --> 27:04.842
Kid, you know
where the fuck you are?

27:04.920 --> 27:07.002
Yeah, I'm
at 140 Union Avenue.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.491
I got
the address right, right?

27:08.560 --> 27:10.005
[all talking]

27:10.080 --> 27:11.570
Yeah, that's it.
That's the address.

27:11.640 --> 27:12.971
Yeah, then
I know where I am.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.610
All right,
I want everything!

27:14.680 --> 27:16.728
I want everything.
I want your fucking--

27:16.800 --> 27:19.041
I want your-- I want your--
your-your, you know, your chains.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.009
Your fucking watches.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.969
I want your fucking rings.
I want your fucking wallets.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.361
I want your fucking rolls.
I want everything!

27:25.440 --> 27:26.646
[laughing,
casual chatter]

27:26.720 --> 27:28.609
Wait, wait.
Hold on.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.001
What is this, a Halloween costume?
What are you doing?

27:31.080 --> 27:33.367
No, this fucking thing
is real, man!

27:33.440 --> 27:35.568
Is this Gotti? Did Gotti
put you up to this?

27:35.640 --> 27:38.007
Hey, do you think I'm fucking
playing around here?

27:38.080 --> 27:40.082
I don't know what's going on.
[laughter]

27:40.160 --> 27:44.484
[gunshots,
shattering glass, shouting]

27:50.880 --> 27:56.364
Kid, take your-- take your-- Kid,
take your finger off the trigger.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.287
That's right!
Okay, listen now.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.443
No one is going to get fucking
hurt, all right? [gunshots]

28:11.480 --> 28:13.642
All right, come here. Come
here and hold this shit.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.290
Yeah, okay.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.442
Gorgeous, right?
Hold the fucking sack.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.364
Everything inside the sack.
Everything inside the fucking sack.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.448
Hey kid, let me
tell you something.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.046
I'm going to find you,
and when I find you...

28:25.120 --> 28:26.645
you're going
to fucking die!

28:26.720 --> 28:28.404
I'm going to fucking die?
That's right.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.289
I'm going to fucking die?
Everyone fucking dies!

28:30.360 --> 28:31.885
[gunshots, shouting]

28:31.960 --> 28:33.883
Everything inside!
Inside!

28:33.960 --> 28:36.486
Inside with this stupid fucking hair!
[man yelling]

28:36.560 --> 28:38.881
This stupid fucking hair! Kid!

28:38.920 --> 28:41.002
This stupid fucking hair!
Everything in there.

28:41.080 --> 28:42.650
Hey, what the fuck!
What are those?

28:42.720 --> 28:45.564
Are those-- hey!
Are those Italian?

28:45.640 --> 28:47.324
Give me the shoes.
I want the shoes, too!

28:47.400 --> 28:49.402
I want
your goddamn shoes.

28:49.440 --> 28:54.082
Put your fucking shoes
in the bag. In the bag.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.891
In the fucking bag,
Gorgeous.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.850
Stupid fucking guinea.
Stupid fucking--

28:59.920 --> 29:01.809
Yeah, you heard me!

29:01.880 --> 29:04.929
All right, now everyone--
I want everyone to lie down.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.167
Now lie down.
Oh, come on.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.242
Lie down on the goddamn ground.
[men protesting]

29:09.320 --> 29:10.367
Lie down
on the ground.

29:10.440 --> 29:13.489
[men protesting]

29:13.560 --> 29:14.971
Lie the fuck down!

29:15.040 --> 29:16.610
Lay down on the floor.
Face down!

29:16.680 --> 29:18.250
Now you lie
on top of him.

29:18.280 --> 29:20.089
Pops, get on top of him.
Just like that.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.844
Look, I said
lie on top of him.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.445
That's what I mean.
Now lie on top of him.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.931
<i>Yeah, just--
yeah, like that.</i>

29:25.000 --> 29:26.490
I ain't no fucking queer!

29:26.560 --> 29:28.085
<i>Now you, lay down.
Lay down!</i>

29:28.200 --> 29:29.725
<i>Now move your hips.
Yeah, just</i> like--

29:29.800 --> 29:31.290
yeah, like you're fucking
him in the ass!

29:31.360 --> 29:34.011
Just like that!
[gunshots, shouting]

29:34.080 --> 29:35.764
You get on top of him.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.768
Yeah-- hey! You!
Come on, chubby, over here!

29:37.840 --> 29:39.808
Fuck him in the ass!

29:39.920 --> 29:41.888
You're <i>fucking dead.</i> Everybody--
oh, I'm fucking dead.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.371
Where the fuck
is my camera?

29:44.840 --> 29:46.080
This is for Frank Uva!

29:46.160 --> 29:48.162
[gunshots]

29:57.840 --> 29:59.888
Open it! Rosie, fucking open the door.
I'm trying!

29:59.960 --> 30:02.406
Open it! Rosie, open
the goddamn door!

30:04.600 --> 30:06.523
Pull it on the handle!

30:06.600 --> 30:08.967
Pull? I am fucking pulling it!
I'm trying to open it!

30:11.120 --> 30:15.125
Push on it! Push it down.
Oh, my God!

30:15.200 --> 30:16.645
Who the fuck was that?

30:16.720 --> 30:18.609
Pull it! God!

30:20.080 --> 30:21.605
I can't fucking believe--
Go! Go!

30:22.960 --> 30:24.166
[Rosie shouts]

30:24.240 --> 30:25.366
You're in fucking reverse!

30:25.440 --> 30:26.805
Shut the fuck up!

30:29.360 --> 30:30.930
<i>(Tommy)
Don't drive stupid.</i>

30:31.000 --> 30:33.321
<i>I'm not robbing
the fucking mob</i>

30:33.400 --> 30:35.562
<i>and then getting pinched by the
cops on a fucking traffic beef!</i>

31:23.200 --> 31:24.122
Then what did you do?

31:26.080 --> 31:28.003
What could I do?
I gave him the money.

31:28.080 --> 31:29.491
There were
ten guys in here.

31:29.560 --> 31:30.971
You couldn't take him?

31:31.040 --> 31:32.485
The kid was waving
an Uzi, Sal.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.130
And you were waving
your prick.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.646
<i>Respectfully,
that's not fair.</i>

31:36.720 --> 31:38.370
<i>Hey, go fuck yourself!</i>

31:38.440 --> 31:40.602
Fair? What am I,
your mother?

31:40.680 --> 31:41.761
You want a hug?

31:49.960 --> 31:52.281
So who's this kid
with the Uzi?

31:52.360 --> 31:54.328
Is he one of Gotti's crew?

31:54.400 --> 31:56.402
That's what I thought, but I
ain't never seen this kid

31:56.480 --> 31:59.404
at no weddings
or no wakes.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.490
<i>[man] Sal, I think he's the
kid who came in last week.</i>

32:02.560 --> 32:05.291
What kid? The kid who
mentioned 140 Union.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.766
The kid who peeked
in the door?

32:08.840 --> 32:12.287
Yeah.
Yeah, it was him.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.930
<i>You going
to tell the Boss?</i>

32:14.000 --> 32:15.843
He already knows.
On my way over there now.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.729
What does he know?

32:17.800 --> 32:22.044
That you guys got robbed.
You got held up.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.485
Why? Did something
else happen?

32:26.480 --> 32:29.404
No. We got robbed.

32:32.520 --> 32:36.161
What else happened?
Nothing.

32:36.240 --> 32:39.881
Nothing, I swear.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.883
A fucking headache
I didn't need.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.687
Today of all days.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.285
[glass shatters]

32:52.960 --> 32:54.485
What do you say, Ange?
Hey.

32:58.280 --> 33:02.649
Hey, Carrie.
Hi.

33:02.680 --> 33:06.002
Listen, I want you to know that
I think about Bobby every day,

33:06.040 --> 33:08.646
not just on this day.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.643
My husband's been dead
a long time, Sal.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.643
It's my son you should
be thinking about.

33:18.440 --> 33:19.885
<i>Okay Robbie,
let's review.</i>

33:19.960 --> 33:22.042
<i>So you get the risotto.</i>

33:22.120 --> 33:24.691
<i>You get enough to make
a nice, big rice ball.</i>

33:24.760 --> 33:26.046
Like a baseball?

33:26.120 --> 33:27.884
<i>Like a baseball, exactly.</i>

33:27.960 --> 33:29.610
<i>Then you make
a little hole like that,</i>

33:29.680 --> 33:32.160
get it ready for the
meat, for the cheese.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.362
<i>You take a little meat,
you stuff it in there.</i>

33:34.400 --> 33:39.361
A little mozzarella. Put it in there.
Then you close it up.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.171
<i>Put it in the egg wash.</i>

33:42.240 --> 33:43.765
Then you put it
in the breadcrumbs,

33:43.840 --> 33:45.365
and dust it off
with little breadcrumbs.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.607
And this is
an important part here.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.445
You take a toothpick, and you make
a little hole like that, right?

33:50.520 --> 33:52.522
So when you put it in the
oil, the oil goes in there

33:52.600 --> 33:54.967
and melts the cheese, right?
Got it.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.929
Rice balls.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.401
Your grandpa makes
a hell of a rice ball, pal.

33:59.480 --> 34:03.201
The most complicated thing I was
ever supposed to do, arancinis.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.725
That's it.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.290
Arancini, Robbie.
What's that mean?

34:06.360 --> 34:08.168
“Little orange
of rice.” Right?

34:08.239 --> 34:10.049
And what's the most important
thing in a rice ball?

34:10.120 --> 34:11.645
The rice?
Everything but the rice.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.802
The love
and the patience.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.485
It's worth it, right? That's right.
Mm-hmm.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.963
Okay Robbie, take your
Ma a rice ball. Okay.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.889
Me and Uncle Sal are going
to do some business, okay?

34:27.000 --> 34:29.731
Got it. All right, big kiss.
Love you.

34:29.800 --> 34:34.089
People all over Long Island talked
about Fiorello's Mobile Lunches.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.561
You couldn't make
those rice balls fast enough.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.802
<i>That was a different life
back then.</i>

34:38.880 --> 34:42.965
Back then, all I was concerned
with was building my business,

34:43.040 --> 34:44.963
looking after my family.

34:48.679 --> 34:51.159
My boy Bobby
had just been born then.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.806
It's eight years, Sal.

35:02.040 --> 35:05.840
[crying] It's been eight years
since they took my boy out.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.490
May he be at rest.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.450
It killed my Missus.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.284
So that thing
we need to discuss.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.324
Not in these days, Sal.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.730
Eagles don't hunt flies.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.046
They scare them.

36:02.120 --> 36:02.723
You sure?

36:03.880 --> 36:05.041
Yeah, I'm sure.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.206
I really like it.

36:09.280 --> 36:10.520
It's nice.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.449
It's a very
nice piece.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.284
(Tommy) You like it?
(Rosie) Yeah.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.561
How much?

36:17.640 --> 36:22.680
With tax, I could give it
to you, six hundred.

36:22.760 --> 36:25.240
Six?
It's a good deal.

36:25.320 --> 36:29.086
Six? How about like 540? No.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.650
Five-- hey!

36:30.720 --> 36:32.085
Hey, how about
a trade?

36:32.160 --> 36:32.763
What you got?

36:37.320 --> 36:38.606
That's what
I've got.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.810
Where did you get this?

36:49.880 --> 36:51.120
My father
left it to me.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.123
Oh, your father's.
Yeah.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.966
Mm-hmm...
All right.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.241
No, thank you.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.725
What, no thank you? What do
you mean "No, thank you"?

37:08.800 --> 37:11.280
I'm not interested.
Thank you.

37:11.360 --> 37:14.409
What are you talking about? Listen, you
know this didn't come from your father.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.131
Next time, come in
with a better line.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.929
Come on. Okay, are
you kidding me?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.002
Like this place
is fucking legit?

37:21.080 --> 37:22.684
Like all this stuff
is legit.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.609
Take him out of here.
Don't look at her.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.848
Don't look at her! Fuck you!
Get out of my store.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.489
<i>[man]
Get this guy.</i>

39:08.560 --> 39:09.766
<i>[man 2] Look at that!
Look at that!</i>

39:14.000 --> 39:15.684
They covered
the fucking line!

39:15.760 --> 39:17.922
<i>That touchdown
just cost me ten G's!</i>

39:18.040 --> 39:19.849
<i>[man] Dom, there 's
a flag on the play!</i>

39:19.960 --> 39:22.930
Oh, look at this! A flag, a flag!
It's coming back!

39:23.000 --> 39:27.562
Oh! Listen to me. I don't
know this ref, I swear.

39:27.640 --> 39:29.324
All right,
this is a stickup!

39:29.400 --> 39:32.051
[men shouting] (Tommy) Hey!

39:32.120 --> 39:33.770
But he's okay
in my book.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.649
Hey. Yo!
This is a stickup!

39:35.720 --> 39:38.564
What do you want? He pushed
off this fucking guy!

39:38.640 --> 39:40.290
Hey!

39:40.360 --> 39:45.890
Shit! Hey, hey! Get on.
Get on! What?

39:45.960 --> 39:47.803
This is a fucking stickup!

39:47.880 --> 39:49.644
This is how
it's going to work.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.882
I want your fucking chains.
I want your watches.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.962
<i>I want your rings.</i> I <i>want your fucking cash.
What the</i> fuck?

39:54.040 --> 39:56.281
I want your fucking
firstborn children!

39:56.360 --> 39:57.885
You know whose club
this is?

39:57.960 --> 40:00.247
Whose club is this?
It's my fucking club!

40:00.320 --> 40:01.651
That's whose club it is.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.722
My club. My club today!

40:03.800 --> 40:05.928
You're making a big fucking
mistake here, I'll tell you that.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.610
[gunfire over headphones]
Oh, my God! Shit.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.167
<i>You think
I'm fucking around?</i>

40:14.240 --> 40:16.686
Is that
a fucking machine gun?

40:16.760 --> 40:18.922
Yo, goomba,
grab that spaghetti bowl.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.401
Grab it! Grab it and put it
on the fucking table!

40:21.480 --> 40:23.130
Calm down, everybody calm down.
Put it on the table!

40:23.200 --> 40:24.850
Put it on the fucking table!

40:24.920 --> 40:26.604
Hey, whatever he wants.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.604
<i>All the cash inside!
I swear to God--</i>

40:31.920 --> 40:33.729
Is he holding up
the place?

40:33.800 --> 40:35.529
<i>Everything. Everything.
Your fucking chains!</i>

40:35.600 --> 40:38.285
Come on, give me
that shit. Everything!

40:41.280 --> 40:45.126
[siren]

40:45.200 --> 40:47.123
Fuck".
Fuck!

40:51.240 --> 40:54.164
Yo, what are you doing?
Where are you?

40:54.240 --> 40:55.810
What, are you on vacation?

40:55.880 --> 40:57.245
You think
this is a good idea?

40:57.320 --> 40:59.243
Yeah, I think
it's a great idea.

40:59.320 --> 41:01.971
Do you know why? Because I'm
fucking stupid, that's why!

41:02.040 --> 41:03.963
<i>Now give me {ms shit.
Nobody's got to get hurt.</i>

41:04.040 --> 41:06.407
Get over there. Get the fuck over there!
Get over there!

41:06.480 --> 41:07.481
<i>[man]
Take it easy.</i>

41:12.360 --> 41:14.089
<i>[man]
Go ahead. You got it.</i>

41:14.200 --> 41:16.328
You got it.
Just take it and go.

41:16.400 --> 41:17.890
<i>We're doing
what you want, okay?</i>

41:17.960 --> 41:19.644
<i>We don't want
a cowboy here.</i>

41:19.720 --> 41:21.688
All right, now here's
what I want you to do.

41:21.760 --> 41:24.445
I want everyone to strip.
What?

41:24.520 --> 41:26.682
I said take your goddamn clothes off!
Come on.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.569
You're making a big
fucking mistake here!

41:28.640 --> 41:30.324
I want all the fucking
clothes off, come on!

41:30.360 --> 41:32.249
Let's go! All right,
all right, all right.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.971
<i>Take them off!
Come on! Let's go!</i>

41:35.040 --> 41:37.008
They're going to kill him.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.691
They're going to take his
balls, cut them off his body,

41:39.760 --> 41:41.603
<i>and put them in his ears.</i>

41:41.680 --> 41:43.330
He's going to have ball
earrings, this fucking kid.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.811
They're going
to take his picture,

41:44.880 --> 41:46.245
then they're
going to kill him.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.526
Somebody called the cops. What?

41:49.760 --> 41:51.524
<i>First stake down here.</i>

41:51.600 --> 41:53.728
<i>Who's calling
the fucking cops, goddamn it!</i>

41:53.800 --> 41:56.371
<i>Everything! Everything on the
fucking table! Let's go!</i>

42:03.400 --> 42:05.402
Hey, back up. Back up.
You're too close to me.

42:05.480 --> 42:06.686
You're fucking
too close to me.

42:13.120 --> 42:15.043
<i>Who bought that shit
for you, your wife?</i>

42:15.120 --> 42:16.042
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

42:28.280 --> 42:30.123
All right.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.567
<i>This is for Frank Uva.</i>

42:37.600 --> 42:40.729
He's coming out now. Get it, get him.
[camera clicking]

42:40.760 --> 42:43.161
Who's got a fucking piece?
Who's got a piece?

42:44.400 --> 42:45.845
Go! Go!

42:47.840 --> 42:50.002
Take a picture! The cam's
dead or something.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.127
Move out of the way!

42:51.200 --> 42:54.124
[camera clicking]

43:02.640 --> 43:04.483
Are you keeping track
of all this?

43:04.600 --> 43:06.090
I'm not--

43:06.160 --> 43:09.289
Seven eight,
nine, ten! 25,

43:11.800 --> 43:14.485
30,000 dollars in cash
on this fucking table,

43:14.560 --> 43:17.211
and that's not including
the gold or the fucking silver.

43:20.840 --> 43:27.644
[no audible dialog]

43:48.960 --> 43:51.122
[no audible dialog]

44:15.400 --> 44:18.688
John broke every rule in the
book doing what he did.

44:18.800 --> 44:21.121
Can you imagine?
Wearing fancy suits,

44:21.200 --> 44:23.885
<i>strutting around town like he
was some kind of mo vie star.</i>

44:23.960 --> 44:26.122
Taking out your own boss
in the middle of the street.

44:26.200 --> 44:27.531
He brought this
all on himself.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.482
<i>Man, he's going
to ruin this life, John.</i>

44:31.560 --> 44:34.245
I mean, if he didn't make us look
like a bunch of fucking idiots,

44:34.320 --> 44:37.688
those two kids wouldn't be out
there knocking over our clubs.

44:41.520 --> 44:43.090
Those two kids
are still out there?

44:45.600 --> 44:46.886
Yeah.

44:46.960 --> 44:49.008
What, are you
on vacation?

44:49.120 --> 44:51.361
With John on trial and the whole
city waiting for a verdict,

44:51.440 --> 44:54.364
I mean, this is
a sensitive situation we're in.

44:54.440 --> 44:56.442
It's embarrassing, Sal.

44:56.520 --> 44:58.887
Well, maybe if you would
have let me take care of it

44:58.960 --> 45:00.530
when we should have
taken care of it

45:00.600 --> 45:02.329
it wouldn't be
so embarrassing right now.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.128
And then what, Sal?

45:04.960 --> 45:06.246
Blood on your hands?

45:06.320 --> 45:08.084
Blood on my hands?

45:08.160 --> 45:10.128
Fuck it, come on.

45:10.200 --> 45:15.047
So I'm shylocking out of the
old Waikiki joint. Shylocking?

45:15.120 --> 45:17.202
Loaning out money.
A point a week.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.601
<i>That's</i> Sammy <i>the</i> Bull.
<i>25 per cent per year.</i>

45:19.680 --> 45:21.125
That's the fucking rat.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.690
<i>[lawyer]
Credit card rates.</i>

45:22.760 --> 45:24.364
<i>(Sammy)
You could say that.</i>

45:24.440 --> 45:25.930
<i>Some guys charge two,
three points.</i>

45:26.000 --> 45:28.765
It's too much.
People get in trouble.

45:28.840 --> 45:30.968
They can't pay you back.

45:31.080 --> 45:33.401
<i>[lawyer] Now, what happens
if they don't pay you?</i>

45:33.480 --> 45:37.644
Don't pay me.
You got no choice.

45:37.720 --> 45:39.688
I'm cracking your head open
with a baseball bat.

45:45.200 --> 45:49.922
<i>You know, Sal, I never was
supposed to be who I am.</i>

45:50.000 --> 45:52.287
I was just a guy
and a food truck

45:52.360 --> 45:54.681
making rice balls for a living.
Yeah.

45:54.760 --> 45:57.923
Everybody thought I should open up
my own restaurant, right? Yeah.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.082
But where was I going to get
the money for a sit down?

46:00.160 --> 46:03.528
I didn't even have money
to pay my own rent.

46:03.600 --> 46:06.331
But then one day, someone
asks me to make a delivery.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.969
So I say why not,
you know.

46:11.040 --> 46:13.611
It's on my route anyway,
so I said okay.

46:15.120 --> 46:17.441
So he handed me
a manila envelope.

46:21.480 --> 46:27.283
That one delivery, it
bought my son a bicycle.

46:27.320 --> 46:30.802
<i>Then pretty soon I'm dropping off
manilas all over Long Island.</i>

46:30.840 --> 46:34.208
But then one day,
a manila came up short.

46:34.280 --> 46:36.647
<i>Fifty Gs short.</i>

46:38.680 --> 46:41.047
So everybody's looking at me
because I'm the guy

46:41.120 --> 46:43.805
driving a food truck
making rice balls for a living.

46:43.880 --> 46:49.205
Who?
Nobody knows this, Sal.

46:49.280 --> 46:50.520
Come on, who took it?

46:52.040 --> 46:53.326
It was Tony Vella.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.731
Tony Vella?

46:57.800 --> 47:00.246
<i>Tony Vella, who used to run
the whole north shore?</i>

47:02.400 --> 47:04.846
<i>So I went to see him.</i>

47:04.920 --> 47:07.048
<i>Pretty soon, Tony Vella,
he didn't run</i>

47:07.120 --> 47:08.531
the north shore no more.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.090
He didn't run
any shore no more.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.844
Whoa, whoa, whoa
wait a minute, Al.

47:13.720 --> 47:16.246
Are you telling me that
you took out Tony Vella?

47:16.320 --> 47:19.164
He made me
look like a fool.

47:19.240 --> 47:22.528
Thought I'd just roll over and
take the lumps from the boys.

47:22.600 --> 47:25.570
Leave his office
with my tail between my legs.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.567
I was just trying
to take care of my family, Sal.

47:33.640 --> 47:36.849
And that's when I got the call.

47:36.920 --> 47:41.084
The boys came to pick me up,
they took me in.

47:41.160 --> 47:43.083
I thought they
were going to take me out.

47:43.160 --> 47:45.128
Of course, you can't
take out a made guy!

47:45.200 --> 47:46.850
<i>$0 they put me
in a room.</i>

47:48.920 --> 47:50.126
You're talking about--

47:50.200 --> 47:53.170
<i>Our boss.</i>

47:53.240 --> 47:57.370
<i>It turns out Tony Vella had been
skimming off the top for years.</i>

47:57.440 --> 48:03.322
So, he was thankful.
He took care of me, Sal.

48:05.440 --> 48:08.171
He offered me a loan.
He gave me a restaurant.

48:10.800 --> 48:12.848
I thought I was taking care
of my family.

48:15.040 --> 48:17.008
Now here I am.

48:19.160 --> 48:21.481
<i>Mrs. Hoffman, look,
it's very simple.</i>

48:21.560 --> 48:24.689
<i>You leave the keys in the car,
poof, the car goes missing.</i>

48:24.760 --> 48:26.728
<i>No more car payments.</i>

48:26.840 --> 48:28.490
Yeah, my cousin Nicky
will pick it up.

48:28.560 --> 48:29.971
Yeah, he's got
a chop-shop.

48:30.040 --> 48:31.644
Well, then what's
your big idea?

48:31.760 --> 48:34.081
<i>I'm just trying
to help you out here.</i>

48:34.120 --> 48:36.202
<i>You know, Mrs. Hoffman,
I'm on parole.</i>

48:36.280 --> 48:38.965
I can't have
this conversation.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.929
Honey, you're not going
to believe what this--

48:41.000 --> 48:42.604
Listen to this.
What?

48:42.680 --> 48:45.684
Gotti: "if I went in
and robbed a church

48:45.760 --> 48:48.240
"and came out with a steeple
sticking out of my--

48:48.360 --> 48:51.284
"...my ass, I'd never plea."

48:51.360 --> 48:53.601
Did you read this? I just
can't get enough Gotti.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.330
It's crazy! I know, it's great.
Amazing.

48:55.400 --> 48:56.970
Oh we follow, do you follow?
Oh, yeah.

48:57.040 --> 48:58.371
Do you follow the Gotti trial?
Oh, yeah.

48:58.440 --> 48:59.965
So do we.
Yeah?

49:00.080 --> 49:01.445
Yeah. It's going on
today, right now.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.090
I mean, it's going on
right now.

49:03.160 --> 49:04.810
If we weren't here,
we'd be at the trial.

49:04.920 --> 49:06.126
Anybody can go to the trial?
You just walk in.

49:06.160 --> 49:07.969
You don't need a badge?

49:08.040 --> 49:10.008
No, anyone can just walk in.
Yeah. Anybody can go?

49:10.080 --> 49:11.491
Really?
Oh,yeah.

49:11.560 --> 49:13.403
You know, we should go.
Mr. Lovell,

49:13.480 --> 49:15.528
I really think that you
will find it very fascinating.

49:15.600 --> 49:18.331
I know because
of your mind. Your mind.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.880
I can't and you can't.
We're working.

49:20.960 --> 49:22.450
I'm the boss.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.369
I don't understand,
you're the boss.

49:24.480 --> 49:26.562
I mean, the only guy who
can do that is the boss.

49:26.640 --> 49:29.962
<i>[recording] You tell this
punk, l, me, John Goth',</i>

49:30.040 --> 49:33.169
<i>will sever your motherfucking
head off, cocksucker.</i>

49:33.280 --> 49:36.841
Now Mr. Gravano, would you explain
Mr. Gotti's words for the Court?

49:36.920 --> 49:39.526
Oh, yeah.
John was upset.

49:39.600 --> 49:42.046
One of our soldiers didn't want
to go to Spark's Steak House.

49:42.120 --> 49:45.329
See, that, the rat,
Sammy the Bull.

49:45.400 --> 49:48.210
Steaks at Spark's
are all right.

49:48.280 --> 49:50.931
He didn't want to be part
of the hit on Paul Castellano.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.923
[lawyer] Why not?
This is amazing.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.207
[whispers] Right? Are you happy?
You look so happy.

49:55.280 --> 49:57.726
[whispers] I am... (Sammy) and
get them all to agree to it.

49:57.800 --> 50:00.246
Now Mr. Gotti said that he was
going to ask for permission?

50:00.320 --> 50:03.005
Yeah, he was going over to Waikiki
Club to get it straightened out.

50:03.040 --> 50:06.931
<i>That's the social club
at 103rd Avenue in Queens.</i>

50:07.000 --> 50:09.207
<i>Big Al's joint.</i>

50:09.280 --> 50:14.889
Now, did Mr. Gotti receive
permission to kill Mr. Castellano?

50:14.960 --> 50:19.249
Nah. Al--
That's Alfonse Fiorello?

50:19.320 --> 50:22.369
Yeah, Big Al told John
to fuck off.

50:22.400 --> 50:26.371
<i>See, it ain't easy getting
permission to whack a boss.</i>

50:26.440 --> 50:29.683
<i>It violates
the natural order.</i>

50:29.720 --> 50:36.046
A mouse don't attack a lion.
And you don't whack a boss.

50:38.800 --> 50:41.724
Hey)'-
Hey)'-

50:41.800 --> 50:44.371
I almost couldn't show
for our monthly meeting.

50:44.440 --> 50:46.204
Could I get
a glass of water?

50:46.240 --> 50:51.485
I figured the poet laureate
of pimps and scumbags

50:51.560 --> 50:55.042
would be over
at the 'Trial of the Century.'

50:55.120 --> 50:57.168
<i>I'll</i> be there
for the verdict.

50:57.280 --> 51:00.011
I don't need to watch Gotti
toy with you guys again.

51:01.880 --> 51:03.484
You sound burnt out.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.847
Maybe you ought
to retire, write a book.

51:05.920 --> 51:08.969
Don't all you newspaper guys got a
novel buried somewhere in your heart?

51:09.040 --> 51:10.929
Yeah, I don't want
to write a novel.

51:10.960 --> 51:14.282
I'm trying to find a six
letter word for marsupial.

51:14.360 --> 51:16.886
Maybe this
will cheer you up.

51:18.400 --> 51:20.482
What is this?

51:20.560 --> 51:23.404
<i>What the fuck
is this?</i>

51:23.440 --> 51:24.930
This isn't real.

51:24.960 --> 51:26.166
You recognize
that guy?

51:26.240 --> 51:29.005
<i>Bobby D?
Yeah.</i>

51:29.080 --> 51:30.844
What is it?
Seriously, what's going on?

51:30.920 --> 51:33.764
Two kids, they held up
two social clubs.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.251
Kid walks in
with an Uzi,

51:35.360 --> 51:37.169
cleans the place out,

51:37.280 --> 51:39.328
and what are these guys
going to do, call the cops?

51:41.960 --> 51:43.200
Who's this?
Who's doing this?

51:43.280 --> 51:44.611
I told you,
two kids.

51:44.640 --> 51:47.120
Who? What, local kids?
Yeah.

51:47.200 --> 51:49.567
<i>Who-who are they? Where are the y from?
No fucking idea.</i>

51:49.640 --> 51:50.971
A boy and a girl.

51:51.040 --> 51:52.644
A girl?
A girl is doing this?

51:52.720 --> 51:54.245
Yeah, she drives the car,
he holds the gun.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.890
Why are they
in their underwear?

51:55.960 --> 51:57.689
What's going on?
I couldn't tell you.

51:57.800 --> 51:59.245
Maybe they stole their
pants too, I don't know.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.163
Thirty years
I've been doing this.

52:01.240 --> 52:03.322
I never thought them for
boxers, I'll tell you that.

52:03.400 --> 52:05.721
Yeah, I'm thankful
for the boxers, believe me.

52:05.800 --> 52:09.122
<i>That was incredible.
Kill that guy. Whack that guy.</i>

52:09.200 --> 52:12.727
"A mouse
never attacks a lion."

52:12.800 --> 52:15.406
Yeah, I'm going to use that.
Put it up on the board.

52:15.480 --> 52:17.050
Baby, let me get a cigarette.
Hey, mouse.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.884
Hey, I'm just
a mouse.

52:18.960 --> 52:20.246
Yeah, I'm a lion.
Fuck off.

52:20.320 --> 52:22.402
I can't attack you.

52:22.480 --> 52:25.165
You know what's crazy to me is
that Giuliani started all this.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.322
Yeah, that's the guy.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.641
So it's like an Italian taking down an Italian.
That takes balls.

52:29.720 --> 52:32.564
"You never, ever
go against your own blood."

52:34.760 --> 52:38.242
Well, my editor
is going to like this.

52:38.320 --> 52:40.527
Yeah, but you
can't have these.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.204
What do you mean? Do you
want a story or don't you?

52:42.280 --> 52:44.044
I gave you the story.

52:44.120 --> 52:46.043
You can't have these photos.
They're classified.

52:46.120 --> 52:48.202
<i>So lose one.
I need a picture.</i>

52:48.280 --> 52:49.884
You want a front story,
I need a picture.

52:49.960 --> 52:53.328
Y-y-y-you're
a writer.

52:53.440 --> 52:55.090
You paint the picture
with your words.

52:55.160 --> 52:57.003
No, no, no, no,
no one is going to believe

52:57.040 --> 52:58.883
I'm going to write this story.

52:58.960 --> 53:01.088
I-I-I'm looking at the picture
and I don't believe it.

53:01.160 --> 53:03.322
I need a picture. You want a
front page, I need a picture.

53:03.400 --> 53:04.367
Look at that.

53:05.960 --> 53:08.406
<i>That's gold right there.</i>

53:08.480 --> 53:10.687
All right.
You can have one.

53:10.720 --> 53:13.849
But I want that on the front page.
You got it.

53:13.880 --> 53:15.405
You did that
on purpose, right?

53:15.480 --> 53:17.130
You made me promise you
a front page.

53:17.200 --> 53:19.362
I can't promise.
I didn't say I promised.

53:19.400 --> 53:22.370
Those guys are psychotic.
They don't belong in jail.

53:22.400 --> 53:28.123
They belong in a psych ward. And
those names, Big Al and Fat Tony.

53:28.200 --> 53:29.770
What was that club?

53:29.840 --> 53:31.365
<i>Waikiki</i> Club.
<i>The Waikiki, yeah.</i>

53:31.440 --> 53:32.930
Where the fuck did he say
that was again?

53:33.000 --> 53:34.365
Waikiki was
like, in Asia, right?

53:34.400 --> 53:35.606
Yeah,he
said Asia. Yeah.

53:35.680 --> 53:36.966
China?
No.

53:37.040 --> 53:39.247
No, it's a state
of America.

53:42.200 --> 53:44.123
Okay, yeah. Good one.
Waikiki, America.

53:44.240 --> 53:46.720
<i>I don't know what kind
of America you live in.</i>

53:46.800 --> 53:49.406
<i>Where was that social club ?
103rd.</i>

53:49.480 --> 53:51.403
<i>Avenue, right?</i>

54:12.040 --> 54:14.930
<i>[man] I'm standing

54:15.000 --> 54:16.684

54:19.880 --> 54:23.168
All right.
All right, this is a robbery.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.090
What did he say?

54:26.120 --> 54:28.088
I said this is a robbery.
A robbery.

54:28.200 --> 54:29.611
<i>I want
all your fucking rolls.</i>

54:29.680 --> 54:31.762
There's no food here.
It's a bar

54:31.800 --> 54:33.245
<i>I don't want
a roll with butter on,</i>

54:33.320 --> 54:34.845
<i>I want your cash, old man.</i>

54:34.920 --> 54:37.685
I want your cash.
Come on. Everything.

54:37.760 --> 54:41.685
Yes, yes, yes. Put it--
Come on, pick it up.

54:41.760 --> 54:44.889
Put everything-- Gramps,
where the hell you going?

54:44.960 --> 54:48.931
Over there, come on.
I don't have nothing.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.128
Oh, yeah? What's that?
What's that?

54:51.200 --> 54:55.330
Nice try. Nice try,
old man. Nice try.

54:55.400 --> 54:56.811
Yeah, you don't
have anything.

54:56.880 --> 54:58.564
I need that wallet.

54:58.640 --> 55:00.642
Take the money.
I need that wallet, please.

55:00.720 --> 55:02.927
You're not getting the wallet back.
Please... Take the money.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.685
<i>That's for my liver.
That's for my prostate.</i>

55:05.760 --> 55:07.171
My false teeth,
do you want them?

55:07.280 --> 55:09.806
M-m-my wife gave me
that wallet.

55:09.880 --> 55:11.803
Tell her to buy you a new fucking wallet.
She's dead.

55:11.880 --> 55:13.928
Have a little decency.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.207
And I need my bus pass.

55:16.280 --> 55:18.521
Listen, if you're going to give him
his bus pass, I want mine, too.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.011
It's only fair, you know.
It's fair.

55:20.080 --> 55:21.764
Nobody's getting
their bus pass!

55:21.880 --> 55:23.211
<i>Come on, sir. You look
like a good kid.</i>

55:23.280 --> 55:27.205
Come on.
Come on. Please...

55:27.280 --> 55:29.851
Come on.

55:29.880 --> 55:34.807
Need my head examined.
What color is it? <i>Black.</i>

55:34.880 --> 55:41.570
Here. Here's your wallet.
That's brown! Black!

55:41.640 --> 55:43.847
<i>Come on. Hold on. I got
it, I got it, I got it.</i>

55:47.280 --> 55:49.169
Here's your fucking wallet,
all right?

55:49.280 --> 55:50.850
Take the money.
I'm taking the money.

55:50.880 --> 55:52.723
What the hell is this,
five dollars?

55:52.800 --> 55:56.850
<i>Take my money,
but give me the wallet.</i>

55:56.920 --> 55:59.048
You know what? I don't have
time for this bullshit!

55:59.120 --> 56:00.610
I don't have time for this.
I got to go.

56:03.520 --> 56:05.363
Fuck.

56:05.440 --> 56:07.522
Come here,
you little fuck, you!

56:07.600 --> 56:09.170
Hey! Hey!

56:09.240 --> 56:10.765
Just leave
the wallet here.

56:10.840 --> 56:12.888
You know, he still
can throw a punch.

56:12.960 --> 56:15.327
Come here! You don't know what
you're doing, you little prick!

56:15.400 --> 56:16.845
Fuck this.

56:23.240 --> 56:25.527
Is this it?
That's it. I told you.

56:28.920 --> 56:30.763
A bunch of senior
citizens in there.

56:34.400 --> 56:36.243
<i>How does this thing work?
On. You</i> press <i>on.</i>

56:36.280 --> 56:38.169
Obviously,
I'm pushing on.

56:38.240 --> 56:40.129
If you yell at it, that's what
actually makes it go on.

56:43.720 --> 56:46.644
Oh Rosie, just--
I mean, Jesus Christ.

56:48.400 --> 56:50.084
Did you see this?

57:01.800 --> 57:03.484
What is that?
Let me see this.

57:09.120 --> 57:12.169
You know what this is?
It's the family tree.

57:12.280 --> 57:14.123
<i>This is
the entire Vazallo family.</i>

57:14.240 --> 57:18.006
What do these initials mean?
Associate. Capo.

57:18.120 --> 57:21.761
Underboss. Do you know what the
fucking feds would do for this?

57:21.840 --> 57:25.083
<i>What? Get' on their knees
and start sucking.</i>

57:25.160 --> 57:28.164
<i>Why?</i> Well you see,
the Mafia's defense,

57:28.240 --> 57:31.847
their entire defense is that
they just deny that they exist.

57:31.920 --> 57:33.365
<i>They deny
that they're organized.</i>

57:33.440 --> 57:34.885
This is all mapped out
for them.

57:34.960 --> 57:36.485
This proves
they're organized.

57:36.560 --> 57:38.244
Look, it's got
the ranking, everything.

57:44.760 --> 57:46.842
<i>(Sal)
Who talked to the paper?</i>

57:46.920 --> 57:50.322
Listen to this. “A pair of Mafia

<i>I don't fucking know,</i>

58:15.360 --> 58:17.328

58:24.120 --> 58:25.645
No. It can't be
the fucking cops.

58:25.720 --> 58:27.529
Right. Because if
it was the cops--

58:27.600 --> 58:29.443
Hey.

58:29.520 --> 58:32.524
If it was the fucking cops,
right, we'd be arrested.

58:32.560 --> 58:34.927
But it's not the Mafia.
No.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.685
<i>Because they're embarrassed. And we'd
be 'm the back 'm the trunk by now.</i>

59:08.520 --> 59:10.761
We can't
fucking call them.

59:10.840 --> 59:13.889
We got this list. It's not worth
nothing if they don't know we have it.

So call them
and blackmail them?

59:16.680 --> 59:20.480

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.803
The entire fucking family, all the
way up to Big Al. That's right.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.325
What are you telling me for?

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.050
Vinny, I want you
to tell everyone.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.963
I mean all your fucking
grease ball friends.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.691
It's the same kid
from the holdup.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.129
<i>Fuck with us, and every single
Fed is going to have this list'.</i>

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.889
How about you fucking
hang up the phone

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.803
and you go fuck your mother.
Right now.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.286
<i>Let me reiterate,
motherfucker. All right?</i>

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.890
I got a will.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.564
In that fucking will,
I got a P.O. box.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.802
In that P.O. box,
I got a list.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.644
<i>Yeah?
Yeah.</i>

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.126
Anything happens to us,
I mean, man, anything!

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.170
<i>Anything happens to me
or fucking Bonnie,</i>

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.811
we're going to take the whole
fucking family down, asshole.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.528
That was so good!
That was good?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.889
What are you
wearing, tights?

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.926
It's just fucked up, Sal.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.241
You're telling me.
What?

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.369
I just got off the phone with Clyde.
Clyde who?

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.681
Bonnie
and fucking Clyde, Sal.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.001
This Clyde? How the fuck
did he get the number?

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.408
That's what I asked him, but he's
talking about he's got "the list".

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.610
A list?
Vinny, he said a list?

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.762
Talking about he's got
names and ranks.

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.530
Goes all the way
up to Big Al.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.123
<i>What the fuck
is the list, Sal?</i>

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.124
It's a pact.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.000
A guy gets picked up
for something, whatever,

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.560
he calls the guy
with the list

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.481
<i>who lets them all know
the other guy's in trouble</i>

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.961
before the Feds
can get to them.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.441
<i>That way the Feds
can't get everyone</i>

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.727
to rat each other out.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.567
And this guy carries the list with him?
<i>Yeah.</i> Joey <i>D.</i>

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.802
Anthony? It's Monday afternoon.
Where's Joey D today?

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:23.323
Joey D is at the Miracle Lanes
Bowling Center.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.962
All right, pal.
Make sure you feed him.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.644
<i>(Anthony)
Bowling shoes!</i>

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:35.327
I'm going to bring you your food.
Just stay where you are.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.802
I'm going to stay here.
Okay.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.645
I will not go away from here.
Okay.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.563
I will stay here.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.722
Yeah, that's good. I'm going
to bring you the food.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.007
You can do that.
And I'll-I'll eat it.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.926
[phone rings]

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.764
<i>Cardozo. (Rosie) Mr. Cardozo...</i>

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:56.286
<i>I read your story
in today's paper</i>

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.762
<i>and I am disappointed
in its many inaccuracies.</i>

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.763
Yeah? Okay, I'm sorry
about that, lady.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:05.009
I said no cheese, Gary.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.367
<i>Yeah, so I read
in your article today</i>

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.843
<i>that you said that we held up
a pair of social clubs.</i>

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.960
Right? And so I looked it up, and
in the dictionary it says that...

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.489
Yeah, so a pair is a set
of two things used together

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:26.885
or regarded as a unit.
Two mated animals, nasty.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.247
Two playing cards.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:37.330
Yeah, so a pair is two, and we
hit three, so joke's on you.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.689
Listen to me, I don't know
if you're for real or not,

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.047
and I don't have time
for make believe, okay?

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.761
So if this is bullshit,
you're not helping me,

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.242
you're not helping yourself
but if this is real,

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:57.362
if this is who I think it is, then
what you're doing is fucking great.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.525
<i>People are talking about you.
People have opinions about you.</i>

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.689
It's on everybody's mind,
but none of that shit matters.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.121
The only thing that matters is,
what's your story?

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.884
People want to know that.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.884
Why don't we meet?

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.928
And have you turn me in
to the cops? No, thank you.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.843
<i>No, no, no.</i>

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.082
<i>I haven't spent thirty years
covering the mob</i>

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.401
by giving away
my sources, ever.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:27.647
<i>I mean, we should get together
and talk about this.</i> Maybe.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.927
<i>Where do you want to meet?
Where do you live?</i>

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.970
<i>You know Queens?
I'm from Queens.</i>

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.371
<i>No shit.
Yeah.</i>

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.886
Me, too.
That's funny.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.201
So anywhere.
Pick a place.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.840
You like pizza?

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.570
I do eat pizza.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.284
Remember you put
your finger like that,

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.283
you open the bail.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.203
I'm going to let you reel
it in this time, all right?

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.044
Then you throw it out there.
Whoa, that's far.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.640
Yeah. Now you catch the bail
and reel it in.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.730
Yeah? Hello?

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.930
<i>(Rosie) Yeah, hello.
Put' Al on the phone.</i>

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.650
Who is this?
Who is this?

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.171
Who the fuck are you?
Fuck you.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.605
Put Al on the phone.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.484
There's no one here
by that name.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.324
<i>There's no one there
named AI?</i>

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.209
<i>You better find somebody
named fucking AI.</i>

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:25.526
<i>Big AI. Fiorello.
718-555-4377.</i>

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:29.446
Does that sound about right?
41 Ocean Avenue, Howard Beach?

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.525
<i>Oh, you fancy, huh? Listen, you go!
some crazy fucking list,</i>

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.762
<i>you know
what I'm saying?</i>

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.764
<i>And I got it. And that's what
I am trying to explain to you.</i>

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.604
<i>I got
a fucking P.O. box.</i>

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.490
<i>Yeah, and in that P.O. box,
I got a will.</i>

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.291
And in that will it says you better
not fucking mess with me or my man,

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.441
you understand me?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.968
<i>Hey, AI.</i>

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:56.523
Get over here. Get over here!
Get over here.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:01.049
She called me, Sal. She called me at
my house and got me on the phone.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.363
I've been violated here.
Who gave her my number?

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.801
<i>Al, ifs e helluva lo! worse
than one phone number.</i>

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.564
<i>So she told me.
Who gave it up?</i>

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.007
<i>Joey D, bu!
if wasn't his fault.</i>

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.969
<i>He had it in his wallet
when the kid jacked him.</i>

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:16.283
He had it in his wallet?
In his wallet? Yeah.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.489
How the hell are you going to let
a guy old enough to be a statue

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.010
carry that shit
in his wallet, Sal?

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.361
Someone's got
to keep track.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.250
We figured Joey's so old school,
he'd be the last one to give it up.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:39.324
Can I trust you, Sally?
Of course.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.925
Call a meeting tonight. Seven o'clock.
My club. All right.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.685
I want everyone there.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.161
Tell them
I'm catering dinner.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.647
You're really going in, Al?

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.690
Everyone, Sal.
Everyone.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.731
You get me that list
at all costs.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.529
You get me that list
at all costs!

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.648
Okay, skip. Okay.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.647
Shit.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.686
<i>Hey. Hey'-!</i>

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.046
So how
are you doing, fellas.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.242
How you doing, boss?

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.884
Thanks for coming out.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.086
I'm starving.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.289
Garlic bread. You guys
see this garlic bread?

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.567
What?

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.607
I'm sorry, Al.

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:27.288
You all know
what's transpired.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:32.764
And the potential ramifications
of the trail. Correct?

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.683
Right, boss.
Right, boss.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.810
Unity is the only solution
in times of crisis.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:44.210
Our principles, our honor,
sacrifice, and above all...

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.804
Solidarity.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.564
That's right.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.845
Solidarity.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.524
If we throw away
our solidarity,

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.888
we throw away
our strength. Correct?

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.805
<i>[all]
That's right, boss.</i>

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.326
<i>How's the family?
They're fine, thanks.</i>

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:07.131
<i>And the little one? He's
getting bigger every day, Al.</i>

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.483
Can I trust you, Vinny?

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.010
With your life, boss.

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:30.408
Let me put it
to you another way.

01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:33.609
If you want to run a food truck,
you got to keep it clean, right?

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.488
That's right, boss.

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.130
And I don't mean run a rag
over the counter clean.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.362
I'm talking about top
to bottom,

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:42.125
get down on your knees and scrub clean, right?
That's right, boss.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.804
Otherwise, you get rats.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.884
You got one rat,
you get two rats.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:49.281
Pretty soon you got rat shit
in your rice balls.

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:52.488
[all laugh]

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.211
How are you doing, Anthony?
I'm all right.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.005
Good. Feeling good?
Yeah.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.890
Good.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.371
Anthony...

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.601
where's Joey D?

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:14.321
Joey D couldn't
make it here tonight.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.970
He's not feeling
so good.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.841
Enough said.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.770
<i>(Tommy) So I got something
for you, Bobby.</i>

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.081
I know I wasn't
always there.

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.083
And I know
I wasn't much help.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.003
But maybe this will help.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.320
W-where did you make
this much money, Tommy?

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.164
When you talking about, Bobby?
Take it

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.446
Where did
you get it?

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.965
It doesn't matter.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.451
What you mean
it doesn't matter?

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.124
Where did you get
this much money?

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.248
It doesn't fucking
matter where I got it.

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.641
I just want you to have it. I
just want you to have it, Bobby.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.006
I'm trying
to say I'm sorry.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.650
Bobby, look...

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.165
I know what
you did, all right?

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.009
I know you did everything.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.844
I know I was a shitty
older brother.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.008
Bobby, I know you
took care of the shop.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.684
I know you took care of Mom.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.722
I'm trying to say
that I appreciate it.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.404
I'm trying
to say thank you.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.210
Thank you?
Yeah, thank you.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.727
W-w-what, you think
you can just walk in here

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.564
ten years later,
say thank you,

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.483
and then everything
is going to be okay?

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.485
<i>Well, no.
Where were you, Tommy?</i>

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.050
I was fucked up, Bobby.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.963
I was fucked up.
I'm sorry, Bobby.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.611
Bobby, I'm sorry look,
that's the point, all right?

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.205
Sometimes you do
everything right.

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.487
You run the shop,
you pay your bills,

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.801
and you're the guy
that gets fucked!

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.724
<i>I mean, look</i> at Pop- Look, he broke
his fucking back on this place.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.086
Look what it got him.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.041
It's no one's fault.
Bobby, I--

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.369
Just take the money.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.283
<i>[mother] Your father
did everything right.</i>

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.362
Up every morning, early.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.329
No man worked
harder than him.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.402
I know that. That's not
what-- You want to know why?

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.329
So that you can have
a better life.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.129
Look, me and Pops,

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.282
we were okay, all right?
We reconciled our shit.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.442
You broke
his heart, Tommy.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.568
<i>You killed him. He died of a broken heart.
</i> I <i>killed him?</i>

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.205
Yeah.
I killed him now?

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.884
How can you
say that to me?

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.803
I didn't kill him.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.120
I didn't fucking
kill him,

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.531
and he didn't
kill himself.

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.648
The fucking mob
killed him,

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.451
and you know it. Oh, we don't
want to talk about that, right?

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.090
You know it.

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.610
<i>You know it.
All right, Bobby?</i>

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.569
Come on. Speak up.
Come on, Bobby.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.404
<i>[mother] He had to
keep this store going,</i>

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.280
and those people were the
only way he knew how.

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.328
<i>You know, he wanted
to help you.</i>

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.209
<i>He did.
He wanted to help you.</i>

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.009
He wanted so much for you.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.445
And for what?

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.409
Come on,
don't say that, Ma.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.244
<i>What' did you do with
your life, Tommy, huh ?</i>

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.448
What did you do
with your life?

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.727
I did the best I could, all right?
I did something. Really?

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.370
Yeah, I did something
with my life.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.124
This? This is what you did
with your life?

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.003
I don't want it.
Listen--

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.809
Ma, I'm sorry, all right?

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.326
I just-- I want you
to have the money, Mom.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.367
Please take the money.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.648
I don't want
this money.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.085
Just take the fucking money!

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.889
I don't want
the fucking money!

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.644
Bobby, take the money!
Don't touch that money!

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.370
Fine, fine!
All right, you know what?

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.920
I'm out of here.
I'm out of here, all right?

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.162
<i>This piece of shit' is leaving
the fucking building, all right?</i>

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.924
I'm out of here.
I tried to do something nice.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:43.802
You know what? Fuck it!

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.804
I tried to do
something nice!

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.364
<i>(Rosie) Yeah, so is this going
to be, like, a big story?</i>

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.681
You're going to--
For, like, the front page?

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.969
Well, you know, we got
a saying in the newspaper world.

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.610
I love sayings,
slogans.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.570
This is a good one.
This is a good story.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.168
It's like a hot girl with
a miniskirt, you know?

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.004
L-I messed it up.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.923
A good story is like
a miniskirt on a hot girl.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.483
Okay. You want it long
enough to cover the subject,

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.403
short enough
to be interesting

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.560
Oh, yeah!
I like that.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.046
I didn't make it up, but you
know what I'm talking about.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.765
All right, so Rosie?
Yeah, Rosie.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.251
You're from around here?

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.731
Yeah, I grew up
two blocks over.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.724
Oh, I'm over at Elmhurst.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.444
No kidding.
Yeah.

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.966
And Mom and Dad still here?
Still live here?

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.566
Yeah, my mother lives
in the house I grew up in.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.165
And my father passed.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:21.450
Oh, I'm sorry.
Miss him?

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.171
Do I miss him?
Yeah, I miss him.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:28.086
Yeah?
Yeah, so get this.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:32.489
So when he got sick, he says,
"When I go, Rosie gets my car."

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.961
So when he died,
my mother and my brother

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.326
they want to sell
the car.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.970
Can you believe that?

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.280
And I said no,
because he loved that car.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.725
You know?
Right.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.245
Yeah, and then
every Christmas,

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.163
we would take the car
into the city

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:46.288
to go and see the tree
and all the windows on Fifth.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.687
Right. Yeah, that
was, like, our thing.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.804
That's good.

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.963
So it's like the regular
things that I miss.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.606
If you're going to--
Right, right.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.162
And that's the car you use
to hit the clubs? What?

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.450
Is that the same car?
Yeah.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.282
All right.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:12.528
What about your friend?
Where is he from?

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.329
Oh, Tommy?
He ain't from around here.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.886
Tommy. Tommy and Rosie.
Yeah, two M's, yeah.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.650
What's Tommy like?

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.883
Oh, first of all,
super handsome

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.645
Yeah, and he's like--
he's just like a genius.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.802
So this was his idea then?
All this stuff?

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:30.326
One day, I come home
from work, Right.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.570
And Tommy was thinking
these guys are assholes.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:39.043
No one is getting hurt,
so is it really a crime?

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.005
Yeah, well... I guess that's
something to think about.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.764
What do you think?
You think it's a crime?

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.320
No, I don't.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.370
<i>That's probably don't make sense, huh?
No, I get it.</i>

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.448
<i>Yeah?
Yeah, I get it.</i>

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.807
Not for nothing, but I like the
way you write. Oh, thanks.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.690
<i>All right, so Tommy and Rosie.
Yeah.</i>

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.165
<i>Tommy is how old?</i>

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.089
29. Tommy!

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:07.687
This is Mr. Cardozo
from the newspaper.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.324
I know who the fuck it is.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.890
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.803
<i>What did you
fucking tell him?</i>

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.723
<i>I didn't say anything.
What did you tell him?</i>

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.290
I assumed--
No, shut up.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.681
No one is talking
to you, all right?

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.445
Pardon me, excuse me. Get the fuck out there.
We're just doing an interview.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.809
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:34.043
He's going to tell our story.
He's going to tell our story!

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.326
Listen to me.
Stop talking.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:44.845
[no audible dialog]

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.685
<i>Sorry about that.
No.</i>

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.322
Are you a cop, or working with
any law enforcement agencies?

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.611
No, not a cop. I don't work
with any associated agency.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.921
I'm a reporter.
That's all I do.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.767
Ask questions and say whatever you want.
That's a cute picture.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:22.686
Thank you. Yeah, I mean,
we read your column.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:27.049
So, uh-- All right, so
how does this start?

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.282
Well, I'd like to ask
a couple of questions.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.966
You know, how this works
is you don't want to answer,

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.610
You don't answer.
That's all.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.605
I'm only going to write
what you tell me.

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:38.971
Well, what
did she tell you?

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.281
She talked
about herself.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.482
You, I don't know
where you are from.

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:44.607
I'm from the Bronx.

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.768
From the Bronx.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.844
Let me ask you-- can I ask
you where did you two meet?

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:51.490
Where did we meet?
Yeah.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:54.689
A party. A party? We
didn't meet at a--

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:57.206
What, you mean when
you were with jerk off?

01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:00.921
<i>Yeah, basically she was with
some jerk off at a party.</i>

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.162
<i>(Rosie) Ask him-- go ahead and
ask him the next question.</i>

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.049
<i>Yeah, actually let's not talk
about that,</i>

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.122
because, you know,
we don't have an anniversary

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.124
and the reason we don't have
an anniversary is because--

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.969
<i>Let's not talk about that.</i>

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.530
<i>(Rosie)
What's your next question?</i>

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:37.165
You want to get married?

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.920
Are you serious?

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.970
Yeah, yeah, I'm serious.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.362
I'm serious.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.728
And you're not just fucking
with me right now?

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.963
Baby, no.
I'm asking you...

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.006
will you marry me?

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:06.971
Yeah, all right.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.246
When?

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.207
<i>Well, I was thinking, you
know, Christmas is coming up.</i>

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.726
I thought maybe we could get
married on Christmas Day.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.484
Oh, my God.
I love that.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.210
That's right.
Yeah, right?

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.890
No, it will be, like,
my two favorite days.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.928
Like, Christmas
and our wedding anniversary.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.684
<i>That's what
I was thinking.</i>

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:33.444
It would be like a--
you know, like a twofer.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.362
Yeah, like a twofer.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:37.410
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.569
<i>I was thinking that, you
know, we could get married,</i>

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:42.244
and then maybe
after that,

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:46.126
we could, I don't know,
move to Florida.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.964
And what,
and open a flower shop?

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.088
Yeah.
Really?

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.924
Yeah, I mean,
I was thinking that.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.406
You're right. We could--
we could do it, babe.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.768
<i>We could do it if we made
a little bit more money.</i>

01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.080
<i>We could buy a shop.</i>

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.005
We could live above the shop.

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.491
I mean, that's
a good life, right?

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.642
Yeah.
With your charisma...

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:06.801
<i>And your charm.</i>

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:10.601
And my charm, yeah.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.324
<i>Well, I never been
to Florida.</i>

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.971
Oh, Florida,
it's paradise.

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.930
Really? Yeah, they
have palm trees.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.849
Oh, yeah, right.
And coconuts.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.801
And alligators
and air-conditioning

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.365
I mean, I haven't
been there myself,

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.965
but that's what I hear

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.451
is it's fucking paradise
down there.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.201
Oh, my God.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.242
Wait, when will we go?

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.049
<i>Well, what
I was thinking was</i>

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.009
<i>gel' married,</i>
Yeah.

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:46.289
<i>January first, go to Florida.
That's smart.</i>

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:51.804
Yeah. A new year
for our new life.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.571
<i>Yeah, ll' will be
like e new life.</i>

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.484
Call it a day.
A new year.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.925
Newlyweds.
New everything.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.650
Yeah, a new everything.

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:03.007
<i>Start over.
Do you want to do it?</i>

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.809
Yeah, I want to do it.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.325
<i>Yeah?
Yeah.</i>

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.561
It would make
you happy?

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:13.886
Yes!

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.640
All right.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:17.841
Yeah?

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.684
Yeah, let's do it.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.922
You serious?
Yeah, we got goals.

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.850
<i>You ended up getting awfully
friendly with those two.</i>

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:36.646
All her words.
I just took notes.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.200
I liked them.
He's a little out there.

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.528
He's on his own little planet. She could
make a fortune running a P.R. firm.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.251
They're a couple of small-time
scumbags as far as I'm concerned.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.563
With a couple
of brass ones though.

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.927
They did end up taking down
a pretty big fish.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:51.967
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:57.644
<i>Not for publication yet', okay?
Okay.</i>

01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.762
<i>But they got something
that we've been trying</i>

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.128
<i>to get our hands on
since J. Edgar ran the show.</i>

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.964
They got something
hat's going to help us

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.883
take down Big Al
and the rest of the Vazallos.

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.928
And the final nail in the
coffin of the whole mob.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.081
What have they got?

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.283
A list.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.163
Joey D sends his regards.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:28.565
Joey D? Joey D..-

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:31.246
Oh, yeah, sure. Joey D.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.731
Is he still building docks?

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.450
<i>He remembers you, too.</i>

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.204
He's got a lot of stories
about the old days.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.567
<i>A lot of names.</i>

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.965
A whole list of them.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.247
Yeah, well,
he's a storyteller.

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.129
He's got a wild imagination.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.244
How about that?
They're heroes.

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.689
<i>What are you
going to do?</i>

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.524
<i>What kind of deal
are you going to give them?</i>

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:59.208
<i>Deal?
Yeah, deal.</i>

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.561
Protection.
They gave you a gift.

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.291
You're going to give them something, right?
They didn't give us anything.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.486
<i>They don't even know
we got it.</i>

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.446
What can I do you for?

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.926
<i>Gotti's going away.</i>

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.651
The Gambinos are done.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.848
The D.A. is already planning
his next show,

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.604
and the Vazallos
are going to be up.

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.205
Oh, yeah?

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.611
Joey D was just
the first to flip.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.331
Congratulations.

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:34.728
Get three more
Mortadella heroes

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:38.407
for my friends here.
Put it on my tab.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.170
Your days are numbered,
Mr. Fiorello.

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.046
It's like Yogi said,

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.887
"The future
ain't what it used to be."

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.526
It doesn't matter, because the mob has
already got a contract out on them.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.171
And what are you going to do? Are
you going to let that happen?

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.326
Me?
Yeah.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.364
You want to take down the king, you
got to sacrifice a couple of pawns.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.647
<i>Bullshit! Fuck that!</i>

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.007
I wrote this because of you. You got
to do something for these kids.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.850
What did they do? They
robbed from the goddamn mob!

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.888
<i>It's a public service,
what the y did.</i>

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.883
<i>W-w-what do you
expect me to do?</i>

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:22.088
Put them in the witness
protection program or something?

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.128
That's not up to me.

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.083
Do you know how much money
that's going to cost?

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.929
They're not going to do it
for these two fucking idiots.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.611
You guys are worse than them.

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.165
<i>Yeah, you are.</i>

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.243
At least with the mob,
you know where you stand.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.048
<i>Rosie.</i>
Yeah?

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.290
<i>You read Cardozo this morning?
No.</i>

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.567
Can I read it to you?
Sure.

01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:02.689
"In the history of crime,
few have been so foolhardy

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.731
"as this striking young woman
and her Uzi waving partner.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:12.409

"With her wide eyes
and sly smile

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.404
<i>"she asks,
'Is it really a crime?'</i>

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.005
It's good, right?

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.649
What kind of car did
those two drive? Who?

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.563
Joseph and Mary.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.722
Bonnie and Clyde,
you fuckwit.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.802
A Chevy.
A Chevy?

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.370
You sure?

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.602
It ain't a Chevy.
They got a Buick.

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.444
You sure?
A Buick Century.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.521
I bought one
for my mother.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.125
Hm, four door?

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.525
Two door.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.931
<i>Two door.
What color?</i>

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.490
Gun metal gray.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.971
Gun metal gray!

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.048
Gun metal gray.
Buick Century.

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.441
Two fucking doors. Just like
it said in the goddamn paper!

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.722
You know I'm running around
this neighborhood

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:20.610
and I run into it. I practically
crash into the goddamn fucking car!

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.887
They live three fucking blocks
from here!

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.689
And you fucking idiots
are sitting in here

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:26.489
with your heads
up your asses!

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.966
Get out there,
find these fucking cocksuckers

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:32.328
and bring them in!
They're done!

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.846

Are you ever going to go
away, like my dad did?

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:37.964
Here's the thing,
one day we all go away.

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:42.762
You understand?
Why?

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.968
'Cause I need to know how
to make everything you cook

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.884
before you go. I want
to be exactly like you.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.369
No. you're not going
to be exactly like me,

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.930
you're going to be
much better than me.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.890
<i>Much better than me.
Why'?</i>

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:03.564
Robbie.
Yeah?

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:08.248
One day you're going to hear
things about your grandpa.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:10.408
What kind
of things?

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:14.565
Well, you're going
to hear things.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.248
And you're going
to wonder who I really was.

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:22.642
You might wonder
what it all means.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.570
You understand?
Mm-hmm.

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:33.089
The point is that those
things you're going to hear

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:37.961
what you got to know is that I
had to pay the price for them.

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.441
Because that's the way you
make things right in life.

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:44.201
You pay the price for the
things you do wrong.

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:45.042
You understand?

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.804
Yeah.

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.769
<i>So if you don't want
to pay the price,</i>

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:49.767
what do you do?

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.608
<i>Don '2' do anything wrong, right?
</i> I <i>know.</i>

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:55.369
<i>Just do what?
What kind of things?</i>

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.011
<i>Good things.
Good things.</i>

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:01.323
Okay. And that way, you never
have to pay the price.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.209
<i>You promise me that?
Mm-hmm.</i>

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.805
You'll always do
the right thing?

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:07.491
Okay-
Okay)'-

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.528
I got a question for you.
What?

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.967
What's the most important thing
to making a good Arancini?

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.326
The rice.

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:16.802
What-- the rice?

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:18.325
What-what are
you talking about?

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.481
I'm kidding.

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:22.126
Okay.
The love.

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.202
The love.
That's right.

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:26.647
<i>That's the only thing you
need to know in life.</i>

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.485
That's the secret. Love.

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:31.562
<i>Okay
Right?</i>

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:32.607
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.204
<i>(Al)
Look at that.</i>

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.807
Mortadella,
what a beautiful thing.

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:50.645
It's the caviar of baloneys.

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.007
The thing about Mortadella

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:56.129
is everybody thinks
they don't like it.

01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:01.604
<i>Until they try it. Then they
realize there's nothing better.</i>

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:06.971
And there's nothing like a cavatelli
and bruschule on a Sunday.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:10.243
In fact, there is no Sunday
without cavatelli and bruschule.

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:16.524
Recently I started hearing
that-- that there's a guy

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.082
<i>who may be living
in this neighborhood</i>

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:25.644
<i>who is involved in certain, you
know, questionable activities.</i>

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.004
<i>Where do people
get these ideas?</i>

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:33.321
<i>There's always
that guy living next door.</i>

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:37.081
Oh, what does he do?
He's so mysterious.

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:39.049
He never comes out
of the house.

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.321
There's always people
coming in, people coming out.

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:46.804
<i>People's imagination
running wild.</i>

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:51.727
<i>The one thing I do know
about some of these people</i>

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:57.085
<i>is that you don't want
to embarrass them</i>

01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:00.004
<i>in front of their family.</i>

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:02.128
Especially in front
of their family.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:12.169
So if-- if you got
to do your job,

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:14.686
<i>I suggest you treat him
with dignity.</i>

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:18.446
Otherwise, there's going
to be hell to pay.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.163
You know, I can't believe
you never saw the tree.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.481
I've never seen the tree.
I'm from New York.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.211
Why would I see the tree. It's only
for out-of-towners. What do you mean?

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.520
What the fuck?

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.004
What's this?

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.285
<i>(Tommy)
What's going on?</i>

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.163
I want to give you this.
I want--

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.810
You guys ever been
to Mexico?

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.769
To Mexico? We're not
going to Mexico.

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.888
We got a plan. We're going
to leave in a couple of days.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:49.282
Please, listen you guys.

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.647
You're a little bit more
exposed than you should be.

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:54.690
Yeah, no shit. Yeah, I think you
guys got to get out of the country.

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:56.808
These guys, they're not going
to let you go.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.490
They're never going
to forget about this.

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.050
It's not going
to go unpunished. Ever.

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.645
Okay? I've thought
this through.

01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:03.250
<i>We go! a plan,
all right?</i>

01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.084
<i>We got to go.
Yeah, we got to go.</i>

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.282
This is the way out of this.
I'm trying to fix this.

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.569
No, you pretended like you were
our friend and you exploited us.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.847
Think for a second.
Rosie, get in the car.

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.730
Take the goddamn tickets. Take the
goddamn tickets, we don't want them.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:18.087
We don't want them.
Rosie, get in the car.

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.525
You're smarter
than this, Tommy.

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.329
You know what's
going to happen.

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.488
I know these guys, Tommy.
Take these tickets.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.608
Take these tickets. You got to
get out of here. Close the door.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.643
We got to go. You got
to get out of here.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.643
Baby, close the goddamn door.
I'm trying to close the door.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.688
Use these tickets. I don't
want your goddamn tickets.

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.127
Just keep driving, all right?
Close the door, goddammit.

01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.409
[no audible dialog]

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.367
You love me?

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:51.446
Do I love you?
Baby I love you, all right.

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.602
You know I love you.

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.324
You really love me?

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:58.722
Rose Marie,
I love you, all right?

01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:01.804
I love you. I love you,
I love you, I love you.

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:03.882
You're my favorite
fucking person in the world.

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.770
How many times do you want
me to fucking say it?

01:38:06.795 --> 01:38:56.795
