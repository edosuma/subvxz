This should go off
like a well-oiled bear trap.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.010
Right, boy?

20:17.010 --> 20:17.880
Yes, papa.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.350
[laughs]
good lad.

20:20.350 --> 20:23.550
[dramatic music]

20:23.550 --> 20:26.090
Where did I put my--

20:26.090 --> 20:27.450
So, you don't
say hello anymore?

20:27.460 --> 20:30.820
Christ, celine.
How did you get in here?

20:30.830 --> 20:31.620
Did anyone see you?

20:31.630 --> 20:34.030
Is that how you
talk to me now?

20:34.030 --> 20:35.260
I'm sorry.

20:35.260 --> 20:37.000
I don't know
what I was thinking.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.230
Punish me
like the rabid cur I am--oh!

20:41.240 --> 20:42.240
Shut up.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.570
Again.

20:43.570 --> 20:46.240
Oh!
Again. Again.

20:46.240 --> 20:49.180
The next one
you'll have to earn.

20:49.180 --> 20:50.610
What do you want?

20:50.610 --> 20:53.350
I want your balls in a bag
that I wear around my hip.

20:53.350 --> 20:57.620
Barring that,
I want the house.

21:06.060 --> 21:07.190
[speaking spanish]

21:07.200 --> 21:09.060
[screams]

21:09.060 --> 21:12.600
[all speaking spanish]
