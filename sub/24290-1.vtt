01:58.792 --> 02:00.125
You were
good, eight.

02:02.042 --> 02:03.208
You were better.

02:04.417 --> 02:05.208
Bull.

02:05.750 --> 02:09.292
You could see down that field
better than anybody I knew.

02:09.442 --> 02:11.583
It's a damn shame
you stopped playin.

02:11.733 --> 02:13.725
It's a damn shame
I stopped growing.

02:13.875 --> 02:18.000
Besides, someone had
to take care of mom.

02:18.150 --> 02:19.083
Yeah.

02:20.375 --> 02:22.612
I know that, uh, it
couldn't have been easy

02:22.762 --> 02:25.000
dealin' with that
the way that you did.

02:25.150 --> 02:28.125
Especially how she
was at the end.

02:28.275 --> 02:31.250
Anyways, I...
came to say good-bye.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.392
To the house?

02:32.542 --> 02:35.625
I said good-bye to this
place a long time ago.

02:35.775 --> 02:38.433
A house is
just a house.

02:38.583 --> 02:41.250
Home are the
memories. Family.

02:42.417 --> 02:43.500
You.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.250
Come on.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.958
Want a beer?

02:49.625 --> 02:51.112
What, too early?

02:51.262 --> 02:52.750
Or too late?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.167
So, how's this old
Tow holding up?

02:56.317 --> 02:58.058
I keep her
going.

02:58.208 --> 03:00.958
She's probably on her
last legs though, huh?

03:02.833 --> 03:04.500
I didn't know
if you'd come.

03:04.650 --> 03:05.933
I'm glad
you did.

03:06.083 --> 03:09.042
I'm gonna miss this
old farm too, you know.

03:09.192 --> 03:10.708
Alot of
memories here.

03:12.083 --> 03:13.375
Most of
them good.

03:16.042 --> 03:18.292
How'd everything go with
the sale of the house?

03:18.442 --> 03:20.183
We didn't get what
we were asking for,

03:20.333 --> 03:23.017
but it should pay off all
of mom and dad's debts.

03:23.167 --> 03:25.083
That's too bad, I was hoping
there'd be some left over

03:25.233 --> 03:26.642
for you to go
back to school.

03:26.792 --> 03:30.375
Study engineering like you
wanted to so badly growing up.

03:30.525 --> 03:32.017
Some dreams are
meant to be dreams.

03:32.167 --> 03:34.708
Like how some people are meant
to be mechanical engineers

03:34.858 --> 03:37.458
while others are
just mechanics.

03:37.608 --> 03:40.208
The world needs
both to keep going.

03:40.358 --> 03:41.417
I'm fine
where I am.

03:43.125 --> 03:45.433
Listen, maybe we
can help you out.

03:45.583 --> 03:48.583
We got a bunch of money saved
up for little Cody's college...

03:48.733 --> 03:49.333
Not a chance.

03:50.208 --> 03:51.250
That kid deserves
the best.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.917
You give
it to him.

03:54.792 --> 03:56.958
Things happen for
a reason, right?

03:57.108 --> 03:58.517
We do what
we have to.

03:58.667 --> 04:01.321
Things don't always
go according to plan.

04:01.471 --> 04:03.848
But, how we react
when things go bad,

04:03.998 --> 04:06.375
that's what
determines our worth.

04:06.525 --> 04:08.142
Dad taught
me that.

04:08.292 --> 04:09.875
You really hate
him, don't you?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.708
Charlie, our father
was a good man,

04:13.833 --> 04:15.237
fifty percent
of the time.

04:15.387 --> 04:16.791
Fifty's better
than nothing.

04:19.208 --> 04:21.267
Fifty ain't enough.

04:21.416 --> 04:24.042
Every chance in life you
get to do something good,

04:24.192 --> 04:25.083
be something
better?

04:25.233 --> 04:26.458
You take it.

04:27.542 --> 04:29.642
Every chance.

04:29.792 --> 04:34.862
# When dad left town,
leaving mom with the house #

04:35.012 --> 04:39.847
# I wish I had stayed, to
help figure things out #

04:39.997 --> 04:44.833
# But you stepped up, to
put her on her feet #

04:44.983 --> 04:47.520
# That's just
what you do #

04:47.670 --> 04:50.208
# When someone's
in need #

04:51.333 --> 04:53.667
# It was you,
who was there #

04:53.817 --> 04:55.475
# When I
couldn't be #

04:55.625 --> 05:00.583
# Doing some good,
standing strong #

05:00.733 --> 05:05.183
# Plowing through,
keeping on #

05:05.333 --> 05:11.333
# We give all we got, even
though it ain't much #

05:11.483 --> 05:14.250
# We show what we're
worth until it hurts #

05:14.400 --> 05:16.350
# And fight for
what we love #

05:16.500 --> 05:20.708
# Where doing right is
just understood #

05:20.858 --> 05:22.583
# We're doing
some good #

05:26.083 --> 05:31.375
# No rain in weeks,
wind was keepin up #

05:31.525 --> 05:33.646
# Couldn't
grow nothing #

05:33.796 --> 05:35.969
# With the ground
so tough #

05:36.119 --> 05:38.505
# People shared
what they had #

05:38.655 --> 05:41.356
# Cause that's
what we do #

05:41.506 --> 05:44.208
# That handful of
seed we got #

05:44.358 --> 05:47.350
# Got us through #

05:47.500 --> 05:52.583
# Cause when the rains
finally came, we all knew #

05:52.733 --> 05:54.142
# Ohhh #

05:54.292 --> 05:59.125
# Doing some good,
standing strong #

05:59.275 --> 06:04.083
# Plowing through,
keeping on #

06:04.233 --> 06:06.183
# We give
all we got #

06:06.333 --> 06:10.017
# Even though
it ain't much #

06:10.167 --> 06:12.875
# We show what we're
worth, until it hurts #

06:13.025 --> 06:14.808
# And fight for
what we love #

06:14.958 --> 06:19.583
# Where doing right is
just understood #

06:19.733 --> 06:21.933
# We're doing
some good #

06:22.083 --> 06:24.458
You know I'm
shipping out today.

06:26.708 --> 06:28.683
I need you to do
something for me.

06:28.833 --> 06:31.042
I'll take care of them
until you get back.

06:31.192 --> 06:33.062
But after you do
what you gotta do,

06:33.212 --> 06:34.933
you come back to
us, you got that?

06:35.083 --> 06:37.500
We still got all of mom's old
boxes of porcelain figurines

06:37.650 --> 06:41.208
we gotta go through and I
ain't doing it by myself.

06:41.358 --> 06:44.562
# Until we die, we
live our lives #

06:44.712 --> 06:47.767
# Just like the
way we should #

06:47.917 --> 06:52.875
# Doing some good,
standing strong #

06:53.025 --> 06:57.667
# Plowing through,
keeping on #

06:57.817 --> 06:59.767
# We give
all we got #

06:59.917 --> 07:03.808
# Even though
it ain't much #

07:03.958 --> 07:06.375
# We show what we're
worth, until it hurts #

07:06.525 --> 07:08.475
# And fight for
what we love #

07:08.625 --> 07:13.083
# Where doing right
is just understood #

07:13.233 --> 07:17.042
# We're doing
some good #

07:17.192 --> 07:18.000
Are you scared?

07:22.917 --> 07:24.308
No.

07:24.458 --> 07:26.833
It's another
day at work.

07:26.983 --> 07:28.975
In the desert.

07:29.125 --> 07:31.375
Where just about
everything and everyone

07:31.525 --> 07:34.125
is kinda out
to kill ya.

07:36.792 --> 07:38.125
Be safe.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.917
Come on. One
more time.

07:44.067 --> 07:44.683
Fourth and goal.

07:44.833 --> 07:45.933
Kick the field goal, man.

07:46.083 --> 07:48.042
Nope. Down by 6,
there's no time left.

07:48.192 --> 07:49.017
Cody...

07:49.167 --> 07:51.625
Hero or goat,
CB2, hero or goat?

07:53.833 --> 07:54.862
Higher.

07:55.012 --> 07:56.042
Really?

07:58.667 --> 07:59.883
The ball is
snapped,

08:00.033 --> 08:01.250
Bishop falls back.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.758
Well, somebody
call a mechanic.

08:18.908 --> 08:21.042
Nancy's piece
tuckers out again.

08:21.192 --> 08:22.958
Ains, it's my car.

08:23.108 --> 08:24.392
I can fix it.

08:24.542 --> 08:27.196
Why don't you just get your
daddy to buy you a new one?

08:27.346 --> 08:30.000
I'm not even gonna begin to
dignify that with an answer.

08:30.150 --> 08:31.604
Besides, I
can fix it.

08:31.754 --> 08:33.207
My daddy
taught me how.

08:34.167 --> 08:35.183
Fine.

08:35.332 --> 08:36.957
I'll just be here
watching the best years

08:37.107 --> 08:38.683
of my life evaporate
before my eyes.

08:38.832 --> 08:41.042
You're not the one who's going
to be late for her appointment.

08:41.192 --> 08:43.000
I doubt your producer
is going to care

08:43.150 --> 08:44.750
considering he's
your boyfriend.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.041
Brad's not my
boyfriend.

08:46.191 --> 08:47.183
Well, not yet,
anyways.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.250
We're still in
that fragile phase.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.725
No labels.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.125
You're single, until you're
tagged in someone else's photo,

08:52.275 --> 08:54.000
and then it's a little
complicated Nance.

08:54.150 --> 08:55.542
The internet
doesn't lie to me.

08:55.692 --> 08:56.475
It wouldn't.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.383
We'll see how you
feel about that

08:58.533 --> 09:00.142
when your sex
tape comes out.

09:00.292 --> 09:02.208
As long as it's the
one with Xavier...

09:02.358 --> 09:03.875
Oh you have
more than one?

09:04.025 --> 09:05.291
Maybe.

09:05.441 --> 09:06.558
Probably.

09:06.708 --> 09:08.667
Oh come on Nance,
don't be prude.

09:08.817 --> 09:10.312
We are liberated
women!

09:10.462 --> 09:11.808
Feminism
in action.

09:11.958 --> 09:14.250
Honestly, Ains, if you think
going all nature-channel

09:14.400 --> 09:16.875
on tape is the pinnacle of
a feminist movement,

09:17.025 --> 09:18.100
you should've
studied harder.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.392
Well, at least tell me you
have a plan with Brad.

09:20.542 --> 09:24.042
The whole "darling daddy's
girl" act doesn't work forever.

09:24.192 --> 09:25.017
Brad is sweet.

09:25.167 --> 09:27.125
But I have my album
to think about.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.687
They still
make those?

09:28.837 --> 09:30.100
You know
what I mean.

09:30.250 --> 09:33.542
Brad says, I don't know, I
have potential or something.

09:33.692 --> 09:35.062
Do you?

09:35.212 --> 09:36.583
I hope so?

09:38.125 --> 09:40.433
I'm just razzing
you, Nance.

09:40.583 --> 09:44.292
All I'm saying is that, maybe
he thinks producing

09:44.442 --> 09:46.792
and procuring go
hand in hand.

09:46.942 --> 09:48.333
What does that
even mean?

09:48.483 --> 09:48.975
Um.

09:49.125 --> 09:51.071
It means
you're hot.

09:51.221 --> 09:52.577
You're available.

09:52.727 --> 09:54.083
You need him.

09:55.667 --> 09:59.667
Well, the only thing Brad will
be "procuring" is my music.

09:59.817 --> 10:01.417
I wish I had
your will power.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.042
Let's give
this a try.

10:06.792 --> 10:08.042
Start.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.458
Yes!
- Okay.

10:11.833 --> 10:13.958
Get me out of here, please,
and never bring me back.

10:15.583 --> 10:16.333
Go.

10:22.750 --> 10:23.517
Hi.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.042
I'm here to see
Brad Hayes.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.833
I have an
appointment.

10:26.983 --> 10:27.979
Nancy!

10:28.129 --> 10:29.125
Brad, hi.

10:29.275 --> 10:30.167
Hi.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.958
Um, hey, sorry, I had
some car trouble.

10:34.108 --> 10:35.142
Again.

10:35.292 --> 10:36.417
You remember
Ainsley?

10:36.567 --> 10:37.017
Yes, Ainsley.

10:37.167 --> 10:39.167
Always a...
pleasure.

10:39.317 --> 10:39.892
So.

10:40.042 --> 10:40.958
You ready to
make some magic?

10:41.108 --> 10:41.958
Yeah, let's do it.

10:42.108 --> 10:42.791
Alright.

10:42.941 --> 10:43.645
Hey, Mark!

10:43.795 --> 10:44.350
Hey, Nancy.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.750
You ready to
rock my world?

10:45.900 --> 10:46.683
I'll do my best.

10:46.833 --> 10:47.820
That's all
we'll need.

10:47.970 --> 10:48.808
Of course
you will.

10:48.958 --> 10:50.517
I know talent
when I see it.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.292
You know where
the headphones are.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.433
Hey, Brad, I was
wondering if maybe

11:03.583 --> 11:06.167
we could record
something I wrote today?

11:08.208 --> 11:09.142
Um.

11:09.292 --> 11:10.350
You wrote
something?

11:10.500 --> 11:13.333
Yeah, well I wrote like
half of something.

11:13.483 --> 11:15.208
It's not exactly
finished...

11:16.458 --> 11:18.070
Let her give it
a shot, man.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.368
You involved in
this thing, too?

11:20.518 --> 11:22.667
I might have lent
a baby hand.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.917
Well now I'm
just intrigued.

11:28.067 --> 11:29.000
Go ahead.

11:29.150 --> 11:30.083
Thanks.

11:36.167 --> 11:37.342
Just breathe.

11:37.492 --> 11:38.667
You got this.

11:43.458 --> 11:47.792
# All of those nights I
stood in that window #

11:47.942 --> 11:50.558
# Waiting for you
to come home #

11:50.708 --> 11:54.750
# Wondering why, you
felt like you had to go #

11:54.900 --> 11:58.725
# If I'd only known #

11:58.875 --> 12:01.042
# The things you said
shouldn't, #

12:01.192 --> 12:03.042
# couldn't, wouldn't, ever... #

12:03.192 --> 12:04.833
Uh okay, Nancy,
thank you.

12:04.983 --> 12:06.475
That was a
beautiful gesture.

12:06.625 --> 12:10.083
But I just, I just don't know
if it was convincing enough.

12:10.233 --> 12:12.208
You know the "shouldn't
wouldn't ever"

12:12.358 --> 12:15.250
part, I just
wasn't feeling it.

12:16.208 --> 12:17.100
Oh. Okay.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.375
I mean you just, you gotta sing
with more emotion sweetheart.

12:19.525 --> 12:20.625
Because you know if
you don't feel it,

12:20.775 --> 12:21.808
we're not going
to feel it.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.695
You know, your voice needs
to penetrate our skin,

12:24.845 --> 12:27.583
make us feel it deep down
in our bones, you know?

12:27.733 --> 12:28.433
I can try again.

12:28.583 --> 12:29.933
Uh, you know,
not today, ok?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.300
Let's just record what
we have planned and then

12:32.450 --> 12:34.816
um, if we have any extra
time, we'll help you out

12:34.966 --> 12:37.333
with your little song at
some point or another.

12:37.483 --> 12:38.000
Okay?

12:38.625 --> 12:39.292
Okay.

12:40.167 --> 12:41.475
Great.

12:41.625 --> 12:42.696
It's good, Nancy.

12:42.846 --> 12:43.917
We'll get it there.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.308
Okay. Why don't we
go ahead

12:48.458 --> 12:51.417
and sing what you've
got in front of you there.

12:55.417 --> 12:56.975
Kat? I'm home.

12:57.125 --> 13:00.375
Oh, there's my
sexy husband.

13:00.525 --> 13:01.392
How was
your day?

13:01.542 --> 13:02.833
Ooh, it just got
better, hi.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.375
Hi.
- Dad!

13:05.292 --> 13:05.850
Hey squirt.

13:06.000 --> 13:06.975
You're still here.

13:07.125 --> 13:08.933
Yes. You haven't gotten
rid of me yet.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.042
Just wondering why my husband
is taking off first thing

13:11.192 --> 13:12.917
in the morning when he's
leaving his loving...

13:13.067 --> 13:15.000
And very
understanding...

13:15.150 --> 13:17.083
Very, very
understanding...

13:17.233 --> 13:17.600
And sexy.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.017
Did I mention sexy?

13:19.167 --> 13:22.917
Leaving his wife and wonderful
son for six long months?

13:23.067 --> 13:24.308
Can I go
outside?

13:24.458 --> 13:25.958
Yeah, of course,
go on.

13:26.108 --> 13:26.875
Don't wander off.

13:27.025 --> 13:27.708
I won't.

13:32.333 --> 13:37.208
Kat, I had to go, I had to say
good-bye to the old place.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.792
I think it was
important to Charlie.

13:38.942 --> 13:40.058
He misses you,
you know.

13:40.208 --> 13:42.042
But you just keep on
breaking our hearts.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.208
And I mean, who else is gonna
teach our son etiquette

13:45.358 --> 13:46.708
and manners when
you're gone?

13:46.858 --> 13:47.308
You will.

13:47.458 --> 13:48.933
You worked on me.

13:49.083 --> 13:52.167
See? This is going back in the
fridge, right where it belongs.

13:52.317 --> 13:53.417
Yeah.

13:54.792 --> 13:55.958
You going to
miss me?

13:57.250 --> 13:59.625
You know I'm going to
miss you, Mr. Bishop.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.208
Have I ever told
you how hot you look

14:10.358 --> 14:11.558
in jeans and a
baseball cap?

14:11.708 --> 14:14.000
Any chance you wanna
trade your uniform in

14:14.150 --> 14:14.850
for cowboy
boots?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.267
Kat...
- I know, I know.

14:16.417 --> 14:20.708
I just, just don't understand
why it has to be you.

14:22.167 --> 14:23.708
Hey. Are you, are
you crying?

14:23.858 --> 14:25.833
No...
I don't, I just...

14:25.983 --> 14:27.808
Baby, hey,
come here.

14:27.958 --> 14:29.667
Dad, I made
you something.

14:30.542 --> 14:32.008
What's this?

14:32.158 --> 14:33.625
Just a card.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.392
You made this?

14:35.542 --> 14:38.267
This is, it's
really good.

14:38.417 --> 14:43.267
Yeah, I don't know, I
just, I know it's dumb.

14:43.417 --> 14:47.583
Ah, well, this, this is not
dumb, this is really good.

14:47.733 --> 14:48.933
It's us.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.425
It's our family.

14:50.575 --> 14:51.767
We're one heart.

14:51.917 --> 14:54.042
You bring it back
to us, you hear?

14:54.192 --> 14:55.708
I will.

14:55.858 --> 14:57.354
I love you.

14:57.504 --> 14:58.850
And I love you.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.458
You guys are my world, and
I'll be back before you know it.

15:01.608 --> 15:03.000
Okay? You wanna
help me pack?

15:03.150 --> 15:04.021
Yeah.
- Yeah?

15:04.171 --> 15:05.042
Come here.

15:07.833 --> 15:08.833
You coming?

15:08.983 --> 15:09.875
Yeah.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.792
# I know you wonder
what makes a guy tick #

15:18.942 --> 15:21.208
# I know you've
been hurt before #

15:22.833 --> 15:28.500
# Sometimes love ain't
what you pictured at all #

15:31.500 --> 15:35.583
#I know you wonder what
goes on in my mind #

15:35.733 --> 15:38.333
# And why I walk
out that door #

15:39.833 --> 15:43.542
# I don't really blame
you but give me a try #

15:43.692 --> 15:46.000
# And darlin'
I will show #

15:47.208 --> 15:49.792
# I'll never
let you go #

15:51.583 --> 15:53.675
# Because I'm
all yours #

15:53.825 --> 15:55.767
# I know it
gets lonely #

15:55.917 --> 16:00.350
# But my heart soars
whenever you hold me #

16:00.500 --> 16:07.208
# In this whole world, you're
my one and only, you #

16:07.358 --> 16:10.083
# You're my one
and only you #

16:14.500 --> 16:22.833
# Rain's gonna fall, storm
clouds will gather in the sky #

16:22.983 --> 16:25.433
# But I'll give
it my all #

16:25.583 --> 16:37.542
# Just to be back by
your side, oh yeah #

16:37.692 --> 16:39.125
I love you more.

16:39.275 --> 16:40.708
Don't bet on that!

16:42.792 --> 16:47.917
# Because I'm all yours, I
know it gets lonely #

16:48.067 --> 16:51.183
# My heart soars
whenever you hold me #

16:51.333 --> 16:57.625
# In this whole world, you're
my one and only, you #

16:57.775 --> 17:04.142
# Yeah, you're my
one and only, you #

17:04.291 --> 17:08.625
# Because I'm all yours,
I know it gets lonely #

17:08.775 --> 17:12.933
# My heart soars
whenever you hold me #

17:13.083 --> 17:18.458
# In this whole world, you're
my one and only, you #

17:36.667 --> 17:38.667
Nancy: I can't believe you're
dragging me to this party Ains.

17:38.817 --> 17:40.333
I'm not even gonna
know anybody there.

17:40.483 --> 17:41.475
We're branching.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.208
And besides, you could
have stayed in the city

17:43.358 --> 17:44.750
with your sexy
new sugar daddy.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.500
Ew, don't call
him that.

17:46.650 --> 17:48.100
Brad is not my
sugar daddy.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.875
I wouldn't even let him pay for
my to-go salad the other day.

17:52.958 --> 17:55.417
Oh, no. That doesn't
sound good.

17:55.567 --> 17:56.708
Oh, is that
normal?

17:56.858 --> 17:57.375
Oh, no.

17:58.708 --> 18:01.000
No, Ains, a large mushroom
cloud of smoke coming

18:01.150 --> 18:04.100
from the engine
is not normal.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.875
I'm going to call Justin and
see if he can come get us.

18:07.025 --> 18:08.558
Call a tow while
you're at it.

18:08.708 --> 18:12.750
Maybe we should just leave it.
it's dead. Just let it be dead.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.083
Ains, come on.

18:15.233 --> 18:15.767
Fine.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.708
Fine, I'm
calling a tow.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.750
Cute.

18:30.583 --> 18:31.612
Hey.

18:31.762 --> 18:32.642
Hi.

18:32.792 --> 18:33.975
This must be
your car.

18:34.125 --> 18:35.917
I'm actually the one
that called you.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.517
Oh, yeah, I figured.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.708
Um, so what seems
to be the problem?

18:39.858 --> 18:41.183
I, umm, I think
she overheated.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.958
I've been having trouble
driving longer distances.

18:44.108 --> 18:45.183
Shorter distances.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.583
Pretty much like
all distances.

18:46.733 --> 18:47.542
Mind if I
take a look?

18:47.692 --> 18:48.850
Yeah, for sure.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.292
I think it's just a small
leak in the rad I can't find.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.917
Well, you
had a leak.

18:55.067 --> 18:55.850
I knew it.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.583
...and that leak
turned into a small

18:57.733 --> 18:59.229
crack right
up the radiator.

18:59.379 --> 19:00.677
No way. How could I
miss that?

19:00.827 --> 19:02.125
It probably
just happened.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.667
That's bad.

19:03.817 --> 19:04.333
Yup.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.633
Do you know a
lot about cars?

19:06.783 --> 19:08.017
Yeah, my dad
taught me enough.

19:08.167 --> 19:11.000
He said if I was to drive
I should know my fill.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.142
Well, either your
dad's a smart man

19:12.292 --> 19:13.862
or he's trying to run
me outta business.

19:14.012 --> 19:15.583
You have a place
you can fix her up?

19:15.733 --> 19:16.725
Yup, right
in town.

19:16.875 --> 19:18.875
Okay. I'm gonna go break
the news to my friend.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.792
Watch out for
flying cell phones.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.267
Ains, it's bad.

19:22.417 --> 19:24.417
We're gonna have to
tow it to the shop. I'm sorry.

19:24.567 --> 19:26.208
That's ok. Justin's
a few minutes away

19:26.358 --> 19:27.542
and then we can hashtag party.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.125
Ok.
Hitch 'er up!

19:30.275 --> 19:31.125
You got it.

19:35.333 --> 19:39.333
# Scared to death, I
hold my breath #

19:39.483 --> 19:41.350
# What am
I doing #

19:41.500 --> 19:45.250
# I count to three,
it's up to me #

19:45.400 --> 19:47.100
# But who am
I fooling #

19:47.250 --> 19:50.625
# Something's gotta be
said, why can't I say it #

19:50.775 --> 19:53.917
# This silly game,
why do I play it #

19:54.067 --> 19:57.975
# There's a battle
in my mind #

19:58.125 --> 20:01.042
# Like what if I stumble
on the first step #

20:01.192 --> 20:04.142
# Then again maybe
I will fly #

20:04.292 --> 20:07.217
# I could be wrong
about this whole thing #

20:07.367 --> 20:10.067
# Or maybe I've never
been more right #

20:10.217 --> 20:13.137
# What if I'm wasting
precious moments #

20:13.287 --> 20:16.443
# Or is it all part
of a bigger plan #

20:16.593 --> 20:19.750
# What if I'm not
ready to lay it down #

20:19.900 --> 20:23.500
# And leave it
all to chance #

20:23.650 --> 20:28.208
# But what
if I am #

20:29.458 --> 20:32.383
# I fell too fast
in the past #

20:32.533 --> 20:35.691
# Now I'm moving
with caution #

20:35.841 --> 20:38.345
# But isn't this
worth the risk #

20:38.495 --> 20:40.547
# 'Cause you're
pretty awesome #

20:40.697 --> 20:42.750
# What's the
matter with me #

20:42.900 --> 20:44.558
# I must be crazy #

20:44.708 --> 20:47.750
# I'm pretty sure
it's a definite maybe #

20:47.900 --> 20:51.517
# That you feel the
same way, too #

20:51.667 --> 20:55.125
# But what if I stumble
on the first step #

20:55.275 --> 20:57.767
# Then again, maybe
I will fly #

20:57.917 --> 21:00.925
# I could be wrong
about this whole thing #

21:01.075 --> 21:03.962
# Or maybe I've never
been more right #

21:04.112 --> 21:06.981
# What if I'm wasting
precious moments #

21:07.131 --> 21:10.178
# Or is it all part
of a bigger plan #

21:10.328 --> 21:13.375
# What if I'm not
ready to lay it down #

21:13.525 --> 21:17.542
# And leave it
all to chance #

21:17.692 --> 21:23.558
# But what
if I am, ohh #

21:23.708 --> 21:29.675
# Maybe someday I'll look
back on this and laugh #

21:29.825 --> 21:35.792
# At all the doubts and
every question that I asked #

21:35.942 --> 21:39.250
# Like what if I stumble
on the first step #

21:39.400 --> 21:41.433
# Or maybe I will fly #

21:41.583 --> 21:44.508
# I could be wrong
about this whole thing #

21:44.658 --> 21:47.483

21:47.633 --> 21:50.595
# What if I'm wasting
precious moments #

21:50.745 --> 21:53.756
# Or is it all part
of a bigger plan #

21:53.906 --> 21:56.917
# What if I'm not

21:57.067 --> 21:59.475
# And leave it

# Then again maybe
I will fly #

22:05.667 --> 22:08.675
# I could be wrong

22:08.825 --> 22:11.587
# Or maybe I've never

22:11.737 --> 22:14.606
# What if I'm wasting

22:14.756 --> 22:17.907
# Or is it all part

22:18.057 --> 22:21.208

22:21.358 --> 22:24.958
# And leave it

22:25.108 --> 22:29.562
# But what
if I am #

22:29.712 --> 22:34.167
# What if I
am baby #

22:36.542 --> 22:40.750
# Oh what if I,
what if I am #

22:40.900 --> 22:43.083
# Oh #

22:55.917 --> 22:57.017
Ainsley!

22:57.167 --> 22:58.625
Your carriage
has arrived.

22:58.775 --> 23:00.225
Thank God.

23:00.375 --> 23:03.883
Well, it was nice
to meet you.

23:04.033 --> 23:07.542
Oh, saved by the
party mobile.

23:08.542 --> 23:10.737
Nance, let's go,
get in the car.

23:10.887 --> 23:13.083
There's plenty of
booze in the back.

23:13.233 --> 23:15.433
I guess that's
your escort.

23:15.583 --> 23:18.583
I'll give you the address, so
you can pick it up tomorrow.

23:18.733 --> 23:20.042
Yeah, okay.

23:20.192 --> 23:20.975
Nance.

23:21.125 --> 23:22.750
Let's get that
hot bod up here.

23:24.792 --> 23:26.875
You don't want
to go, do you?

23:27.025 --> 23:28.083
I do not.

23:29.833 --> 23:32.558
Hey, guys, unfortunately
the shop has a strict rule

23:32.708 --> 23:34.987
that the owner of the vehicle
must stay with the vehicle

23:35.137 --> 23:37.417
until it's fixed, so I guess
that means that Miss Nancy's

23:37.567 --> 23:39.833
going to have to
rent a room in town.

23:39.983 --> 23:40.808
What are
you doing?

23:40.958 --> 23:42.475
Getting you
outta going.

23:42.625 --> 23:44.779
Unless you wanna go
and have what I'm sure

23:44.929 --> 23:46.848
will be a wonderful time
with your friends.

23:46.998 --> 23:48.767
By all means, don't let
me get in your way.

23:48.917 --> 23:51.292
Nance, we have his plates,
he can't steal your car.

23:51.442 --> 23:52.308
Can we go?

23:52.458 --> 23:54.100
Ains, hold
on a sec.

23:54.250 --> 23:56.500
Is there really a room
I can rent tonight?

23:56.650 --> 23:57.875
I don't even
know your name.

23:58.875 --> 24:00.000
It's yours if
you want it.

24:00.150 --> 24:02.000
And I'm Charlie.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.767
I'm Nancy.

24:03.917 --> 24:05.667
I have a
boyfriend.

24:06.792 --> 24:08.433
Yeah, good.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.833
Ains, I think I'm just going
to stay with my car tonight,

24:10.983 --> 24:13.083
I'm sorry. You guys go to the
cottage without me.

24:13.233 --> 24:13.975
Ok, fine.

24:14.125 --> 24:16.375
Don't do anything
I would do!

24:16.525 --> 24:17.375
Let's go!

24:44.875 --> 24:47.250
Okay. I'm just gonna
load in your car.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.667
The motel is just
up the street.

24:49.817 --> 24:51.500
Ok, thanks.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.458
So, I talked to the motel lady,
said there's no rooms tonight.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.833
Some Jamboree
or something?

25:10.983 --> 25:13.058
Oh. Totally slipped
my mind.

25:13.208 --> 25:15.625
Um, well you can always
stay at my place?

25:15.775 --> 25:16.583
It's nothing
fancy but...

25:16.733 --> 25:17.725
Uh, whoa,
cowboy.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.958
You expecting me to
fall for that one?

25:20.108 --> 25:20.975
Fall for what?

25:21.125 --> 25:22.833
I can't
believe you.

25:22.983 --> 25:23.725
What?

25:23.875 --> 25:25.216
Is this some, like,
elaborate scheme

25:25.366 --> 25:26.708
to get into my pants
or something?

25:26.858 --> 25:27.725
Excuse me?

25:27.875 --> 25:29.341
You heard me.
I ditched my friends...

25:29.491 --> 25:30.808
You said that they
weren't your friends.

25:30.958 --> 25:33.500
Because you told me you had
a place for me to stay and...

25:33.650 --> 25:34.958
Ok first off, I've
never done anything

25:35.108 --> 25:36.058
elaborate in my
entire life.

25:36.208 --> 25:37.833
And aren't you making
a huge assumption?

25:39.958 --> 25:41.125
My interest in you.

25:42.500 --> 25:45.542
Are you saying that
you're not interested in me?

25:45.692 --> 25:46.933
I'm not saying
that, either.

25:47.083 --> 25:49.862
Well, then, would you like to
explain to me what I'm doing

25:50.012 --> 25:52.792
here with no place to stay
besides your dumpy bachelor pad?

25:54.292 --> 25:55.767
Listen.

25:55.917 --> 25:57.125
I forgot about
the Jamboree.

25:57.275 --> 25:58.058
Honest mistake.

25:58.208 --> 25:59.883
I haven't been
there in a long time.

26:00.033 --> 26:01.558
Right, this is my
convinced face.

26:01.708 --> 26:03.267
Let me make something
perfectly clear.

26:03.417 --> 26:07.458
My intentions towards you are
purely of the gentleman variety.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.875
It's not just some scheme
to get into your pants.

26:10.025 --> 26:11.604
Gentleman's a
dying term.

26:11.754 --> 26:13.183
Not where I
come from.

26:13.333 --> 26:14.542
And, honestly, your
convinced face looks

26:14.692 --> 26:16.417
a lot like your
pissed off face.

26:16.567 --> 26:17.750
Virtually no
difference.

26:17.900 --> 26:18.933
Not staying
with you.

26:19.083 --> 26:21.100
Ok, then I can also drive
you up to the cottage

26:21.250 --> 26:24.725
where you can sleep on a futon
with a fondling frat boy.

26:24.875 --> 26:28.500
Or you can hang here with me,
and I'll be a perfect gentleman.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.433
There's that
word again.

26:30.583 --> 26:32.708
Fondling frat boy?
Perfect gentleman?

26:34.333 --> 26:38.292
Charlie, you still don't have
a place for me to stay, like...

26:40.667 --> 26:42.362
You can stay at my
sister-in-law's.

26:42.512 --> 26:44.208
She's got a pull-out
sofa in the den.

26:47.917 --> 26:50.100
Okay.

26:50.250 --> 26:51.404
No funny
business.

26:51.554 --> 26:52.702
Oh, you got it.

26:52.852 --> 26:53.850
Nothing fun.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.225
No smiles, laughing,
just serious work.

26:56.375 --> 26:57.850
And we better not go to
the Jamboree because

26:58.000 --> 27:00.583
the possibility for funny
business is just way too high.

27:02.292 --> 27:05.208
Okay. Maybe we can go
to the Jamboree.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.958
Risky.
Very risky.

27:10.458 --> 27:11.654
Just friends.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.181
Of course.

27:13.331 --> 27:14.708
Friends.

27:16.333 --> 27:18.017
Hey, um, I'm
sorry I came off

27:18.167 --> 27:20.208
a little full of
myself back there.

27:21.542 --> 27:22.683
Okay.

27:22.833 --> 27:24.708
A lot full of
myself back there.

27:24.858 --> 27:25.308
I'm sorry.

27:25.458 --> 27:26.558
Don't worry
about it.

27:26.708 --> 27:29.125
It's not my first run
in with a prima-donna.

27:29.275 --> 27:30.308
Ex-girlfriend?

27:30.458 --> 27:31.833
Former
running back.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.321
It's a football
position?

27:36.471 --> 27:38.892
Yeah, not really
into sports.

27:39.042 --> 27:42.333
So I guess that it wouldn't
impress you that I was QB1

27:42.483 --> 27:45.375
and we were State Champs
two years running?

27:45.525 --> 27:48.250
Maybe. How many home
runs did you hit?

27:55.167 --> 27:56.100
Hello?

27:56.250 --> 27:57.183
Hey Kat, it's me.

27:57.333 --> 27:58.833
Oh, hey, Charlie.
Hey, Cody mentioned

27:58.983 --> 28:00.479
he saw you before
he took off.

28:00.629 --> 28:01.975
Yeah, he stopped
by the old house

28:02.125 --> 28:03.433
and we threw a few
passes in the field.

28:03.583 --> 28:06.375
Aww, too bad I wasn't there
to cheer you boys on, huh?

28:06.525 --> 28:08.125
Best head cheerleader
this town's ever seen.

28:08.275 --> 28:09.000
Go Ravens.

28:10.375 --> 28:13.958
Um, so I was actually kinda
calling for some advice,

28:14.108 --> 28:14.517
I um...

28:14.667 --> 28:15.975
About a girl?

28:16.125 --> 28:17.308
Wait, how'd
you know?

28:17.458 --> 28:19.042
Well, I already showed you
how to patch your pants.

28:19.192 --> 28:20.725
So uh, what else
could there be?

28:20.875 --> 28:22.250
You know I haven't
really dated anyone

28:22.400 --> 28:24.396
since mom got
sick, and um...

28:24.546 --> 28:26.542
And you really
like this one?

28:26.692 --> 28:27.892
Maybe.

28:28.042 --> 28:29.875
I mean, I
think I could.

28:31.125 --> 28:32.933
Well, is she going
to the Jamboree?

28:33.083 --> 28:35.070
She actually didn't
really know about it,

28:35.220 --> 28:36.889
and now she kinda needs
a place to stay...

28:37.039 --> 28:38.708
Oh, well she can of
course she can stay here!

28:38.858 --> 28:40.225
Ok great, thanks.

28:40.375 --> 28:43.154
And, um, right now I
was actually kinda

28:43.304 --> 28:46.083
thinking of taking
her to the Jamboree.

28:46.233 --> 28:47.100
Kinda or gonna?

28:47.250 --> 28:49.667
I wanna, I just
don't know if I should,

28:49.817 --> 28:51.267
I mean, she has
a boyfriend.

28:51.417 --> 28:54.083
Oh, I mean if she was
really into her boyfriend,

28:54.233 --> 28:55.958
she wouldn't be giving
you the time of day.

28:56.108 --> 28:57.833
Well that's what
I'm nervous about.

28:57.983 --> 28:59.458
A Bishop-boy
nervous?

28:59.608 --> 29:00.183
Wow.

29:00.333 --> 29:03.042
She must be
some girl.

29:03.192 --> 29:04.458
Good luck!

29:06.958 --> 29:07.945
Trouble.

29:08.095 --> 29:08.933
Change.

29:09.083 --> 29:11.417
Thanks, Mrs. Stanley.
- Mm-hmm.

29:11.567 --> 29:13.975
Excuse me, girls.

29:14.125 --> 29:17.542
Hi, Charlie, are you going
to the Jamboree tonight?

29:17.692 --> 29:18.958
Yeah, I'm thinking
about it.

29:19.108 --> 29:20.458
Great, see
you there.

29:20.608 --> 29:21.458
You got it!

29:22.250 --> 29:23.725
Well, hej there,
Charlie.

29:23.875 --> 29:25.167
Did you see a girl
come in here?

29:25.317 --> 29:26.225
She's blonde, pretty.

29:26.375 --> 29:27.875
Uh, not really
from around here.

29:28.025 --> 29:29.667
Oh, yes,
she's right...

29:31.333 --> 29:33.058
Was over there.

29:33.208 --> 29:35.225
Huh, guess
she slipped out.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.708
This book is distracting
to say the least.

29:37.858 --> 29:39.541
Mr. S know you're
reading that?

29:39.691 --> 29:41.225
Shh, It'll be our
little secret.

29:41.375 --> 29:44.792
So about that girl, um, like I
said she's not from around here,

29:44.942 --> 29:45.892
but I was kind of
thinking about

29:46.042 --> 29:47.375
bringing her to the
Jamboree tonight.

29:47.525 --> 29:49.500
How lovely!
So it's a date?

29:49.650 --> 29:51.542
No, uh, not a date.

29:51.692 --> 29:52.875
I mean, it's...

29:54.333 --> 29:56.583
I just want to look
presentable. You know?

29:58.125 --> 29:59.925
You need a
new shirt.

30:00.075 --> 30:01.725
I need a
new shirt.

30:01.875 --> 30:05.417
Alrighty,
let's see, um.

30:05.567 --> 30:08.333
Nope, nope, nope.

30:08.483 --> 30:10.791
Ah, here.

30:10.941 --> 30:13.250
Try this one.

30:14.542 --> 30:16.267
Oh, perfect.

30:16.417 --> 30:19.000
Brings out the deep
green of your eyes.

30:19.150 --> 30:19.767
Okay I'll take it.

30:19.917 --> 30:21.417
I'll see you
around, okay?

30:21.567 --> 30:22.183
Bye-bye.

30:22.333 --> 30:24.417
Bye Charlie.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.542
What do you think,
for the Jamboree?

30:34.692 --> 30:35.542
Beautiful.

30:35.692 --> 30:36.142
Okay.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.592
I'll take it.

30:37.742 --> 30:38.962
He's a good boy.

30:39.112 --> 30:40.183
Don't hurt him.

30:40.333 --> 30:41.767
I doubt I have
that kind of power.

30:41.917 --> 30:46.500
Well, you're the first girl in
a long time to catch his eye.

31:06.458 --> 31:07.683
Where are
we going?

31:07.833 --> 31:09.500
This doesn't look
like a Jamboree.

31:09.650 --> 31:10.558
It's my
old house.

31:10.708 --> 31:13.167
The new people don't
move in 'til tomorrow.

31:13.317 --> 31:14.183
Come on.

31:14.333 --> 31:16.375
Trust me.
It'll be worth it.

31:16.525 --> 31:17.583
Okay.

31:30.750 --> 31:32.100
Wow.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.821
My mom always thought
that this was

31:33.971 --> 31:35.542
the closest place to
heaven on Earth.

31:36.917 --> 31:39.000
My mom used to say that
caramel pecan ice cream

31:39.150 --> 31:40.625
was the closest thing
to heaven on Earth.

31:40.775 --> 31:42.521
Your mother sounds
like a smart lady.

31:42.671 --> 31:44.417
Yours, too. Maybe they
should meet.

31:46.333 --> 31:47.183
Oh.

31:47.333 --> 31:49.042
I'm sorry Charlie,
I didn't know.

31:49.192 --> 31:50.558
No, that's okay.

31:50.708 --> 31:55.000
She got sick a couple years back
and... she didn't get better.

31:55.150 --> 31:56.767
I can't even
imagine.

31:56.917 --> 31:59.375
I've never lost
anybody before.

31:59.525 --> 32:00.958
Then you're lucky.

32:01.108 --> 32:01.917
Yeah.

32:03.417 --> 32:04.767
She always
used to say

32:04.917 --> 32:08.125
you don't know sweet
until you've had sour.

32:08.275 --> 32:09.625
Something like that.

32:11.125 --> 32:14.458
Anyway, that's just why I
stopped going to the Jamboree.

32:14.608 --> 32:16.583
She loved them, and,
after she died,

32:16.733 --> 32:18.600
it just wasn't
fun anymore.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.708
Charlie, we don't
have to go tonight.

32:20.858 --> 32:21.875
No, I do.

32:23.833 --> 32:26.625
You got to keep on
keeping on, right?

32:26.775 --> 32:28.208
I guess so.

32:29.292 --> 32:31.487
So, the shop
was your dad's?

32:31.637 --> 32:33.785
My brother is in
the military,

32:33.935 --> 32:36.083
and I took over
after my dad left.

32:36.233 --> 32:37.208
And you love it?

32:37.358 --> 32:38.562
I'm good at it.

32:38.712 --> 32:39.767
I don't love it.

32:39.917 --> 32:42.737
I was always interested in
mechanical engineering but,

32:42.887 --> 32:45.708
it's the never ending oil
changes and tire rotations

32:45.858 --> 32:47.850
that I'm just not
crazy about.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.142
So why didn't you
study engineering?

32:50.292 --> 32:53.208
My parents didn't have enough
money to send us to college

32:53.358 --> 32:54.725
and I was gonna apply
for scholarships,

32:54.875 --> 32:59.167
but once my mom got
sick it just kinda, fizzled.

32:59.317 --> 33:00.583
It's not too
late, Charlie.

33:03.917 --> 33:05.433
I think it is.

33:05.583 --> 33:08.458
Anyway, it's my brother who's
got the big ol' Purple Heart

33:08.608 --> 33:10.308
you know, making
a difference.

33:10.458 --> 33:13.767
Doing the right thing just
came naturally to him.

33:13.917 --> 33:17.208
Truth is, I just don't feel
like my story's written yet.

33:17.358 --> 33:18.625
My family's here.

33:18.775 --> 33:19.892
Well, what's left.

33:20.042 --> 33:24.208
I've got the shop
and, it's home.

33:24.358 --> 33:24.850
So, what about you?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.487
What do you want to
do with your life?

33:26.637 --> 33:28.125
I'm sure you've got
it all planned out,

33:28.275 --> 33:29.750
sophisticated city
girl and all?

33:29.900 --> 33:31.375
I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

33:31.525 --> 33:32.308
A girl like you?

33:32.458 --> 33:34.267
You know what
you want.

33:34.417 --> 33:37.167
Well, I want to be a
singer, singer/songwriter,

33:37.317 --> 33:38.433
trying to
be one.

33:38.583 --> 33:41.667
I've been writing songs
since I was, like, fourteen.

33:43.208 --> 33:44.875
So, sing something.

33:45.025 --> 33:45.600
Now?

33:45.750 --> 33:47.225
Yeah, something
you wrote.

33:47.375 --> 33:48.779
No, no I'm not going
to sing here...

33:48.929 --> 33:50.639
Yeah, sing something.
Just a few bars.

33:50.789 --> 33:52.715
I sing in front of,
like, my friends...

33:52.865 --> 33:54.792
Hey, you want to be
a singer, right?

33:54.942 --> 33:55.625
Yes.

33:56.167 --> 33:59.167
So, sing.

34:01.542 --> 34:03.042
Sing.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.642
Okay. Fine.

34:05.792 --> 34:08.292
Whoo!
Come on Nancy!

34:08.442 --> 34:09.058
Charlie!

34:09.208 --> 34:10.350
What? Come on.
I'm excited.

34:10.500 --> 34:11.875
This is what your
fans are gonna be like.

34:12.025 --> 34:12.933
My fans?

34:13.083 --> 34:14.779
Oh yeah, when you're
like a big star

34:14.929 --> 34:16.625
and you're playing
for big towns,

34:16.775 --> 34:19.708
big crowds and
big lights.

34:19.858 --> 34:21.250
Everything's big, huh?

34:22.292 --> 34:23.600
Dreams've
gotta be big.

34:23.750 --> 34:26.091
Coming from the guy who
gave up his dream of being

34:26.241 --> 34:28.583
an engineer to work in the
shop the rest of his life,

34:28.733 --> 34:30.625
get married quick,
raise a couple kids.

34:32.375 --> 34:34.292
Well it's a different
kind of big.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.250
Sing.

34:38.708 --> 34:39.708
Okay.

34:43.292 --> 34:47.958
# All of those nights I
stood in that window #

34:48.108 --> 34:50.308
# Waiting for you
to come home #

34:50.458 --> 34:54.792
# Wondering why you
felt like you had to go #

34:54.942 --> 34:59.308
# If I'd only
known #

34:59.458 --> 35:02.458
# The things you said
shouldn't, couldn't, wouldn't #

35:02.608 --> 35:08.642
# Ever come true,
came true #

35:08.792 --> 35:11.542
# Here I am standing
in front of you #

35:11.692 --> 35:14.062
# Don't know
what to do #

35:14.212 --> 35:16.433
# Don't wanna
throw us away #

35:16.583 --> 35:19.917
# Here I am believin',
lookin' for a reason #

35:20.067 --> 35:23.146
# We're running out
of things to say #

35:23.296 --> 35:26.225
# So much time and
now I'm findin #

35:26.375 --> 35:37.333
# I was wrong all along
so now here I am gone #

35:39.833 --> 35:40.833
That's, uh...

35:40.983 --> 35:41.600
I know.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.125
It needs some
work, I just...

35:43.275 --> 35:44.000
I loved it.

35:45.167 --> 35:46.083
Yeah?

35:46.583 --> 35:48.083
Yeah.

35:50.333 --> 35:53.800
So, um, so you want
to get going?

35:53.950 --> 35:57.417
Maybe just, a
couple of minutes.

36:05.083 --> 36:06.750
Wow, it looks like the
entire town is here.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.937
Entire town?
Try half the county.

36:09.087 --> 36:10.975
This Jamboree is
world-renowned.

36:11.125 --> 36:14.542
Okay, would you believe
country-renowned?

36:14.692 --> 36:15.208
That's pretty good.

36:15.358 --> 36:16.058
Okay.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.042
Okay, what do
you want?

36:17.192 --> 36:18.142
What do
they have?

36:18.292 --> 36:19.625
Anything you
could imagine.

36:19.775 --> 36:20.500
What'll it be Charlie?

36:20.650 --> 36:21.600
Ladies first.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.958
Okay, um could I get a
Peach and Honey Sangria.

36:24.108 --> 36:25.225
Half the OJ,
double the lime.

36:25.375 --> 36:27.100
And if you guys
have fresh peaches

36:27.250 --> 36:29.458
instead of frozen peaches,
that would be great.

36:29.608 --> 36:30.833
Thanks.

36:30.983 --> 36:32.145
Peaches?

36:32.295 --> 36:33.458
Two beers.

36:33.608 --> 36:34.458
Yeah.

36:38.292 --> 36:39.475
Thanks.

36:39.625 --> 36:41.042
Cheers.
- Cheers.

36:48.417 --> 36:51.750
# Don't you wish it
could be that #

36:51.900 --> 36:53.683
# We could take
eternity and #

36:53.833 --> 36:57.833
# Turn it into this
single solitary moment #

36:57.983 --> 37:00.000
# There's no one else
but you and me #

37:00.150 --> 37:01.017
And me.

37:01.167 --> 37:02.683
# Surrounded by
our destiny #

37:02.833 --> 37:06.892
# And there's no other
place that we'd rather be #

37:07.042 --> 37:11.542
# It's times like this that we
shouldn't take for granted #

37:11.692 --> 37:15.667
# And things couldn't be any
better if we planned it #

37:15.817 --> 37:18.250
# Have ever had so much
fun in your life #

37:18.400 --> 37:20.833
# Bein' here cause you
never felt better #

37:20.983 --> 37:22.833
# For as long as
there's forever #

37:22.983 --> 37:24.350
# Losin' track
of time #

37:24.500 --> 37:27.542
# Have you ever had so
much fun in your life #

37:27.692 --> 37:29.350
# Not thinkin'
about tomorrow #

37:29.500 --> 37:31.625
# Leave behind the
pain and sorrow #

37:31.775 --> 37:37.808
# Let go to lose
your mind #

37:37.958 --> 37:40.958
# Have you ever had so
much fun in your life #

37:48.708 --> 37:51.279
# Don't you wish it
could be forever #

37:51.429 --> 37:53.850
# Right here like
this, us together #

37:54.000 --> 37:58.125
# There's no better time
it's now or never #

37:58.275 --> 38:00.542
# This is what our
life could be #

38:00.692 --> 38:02.642
# An everyday
reality #

38:02.792 --> 38:07.112
# It's beyond what most
people see in their dreams #

38:07.262 --> 38:11.472
# Breathin', touchin',
tastin', livin' in the moment #

38:11.622 --> 38:15.833
# Cause things couldn't be
any better and we know it #

38:15.983 --> 38:18.333
# Have ever had so much
fun in your life #

38:18.483 --> 38:20.833
# Bein' here cause you
never felt better #

38:20.983 --> 38:23.167
# For as long as
there's forever #

38:23.317 --> 38:24.558
# Losin' track
of time #

38:24.708 --> 38:27.667
# Have you ever had so
much fun in your life #

38:27.817 --> 38:29.517
# Not thinkin' about
tomorrow #

38:29.667 --> 38:32.000
# Leave behind the
pain and sorrow #

38:32.150 --> 38:37.625
# Let go to lose
your mind #

38:38.917 --> 38:41.050
# Each second better
than the last #

38:41.200 --> 38:43.183
# Never want to let
this moment pass #

38:43.333 --> 38:47.542
# Not thinking 'bout what
the future will bring #

38:47.692 --> 38:49.917
# Each second better
than the last #

38:50.067 --> 38:52.142
# Never want to let
this moment pass #

38:52.292 --> 38:56.292
# So I'll just start to dance
and you'll start to sing #

38:56.442 --> 38:58.833
# Let go to lose
your mind #

39:06.542 --> 39:09.875
# Have you ever had so
much fun in your life #

39:10.025 --> 39:15.558
# So much fun,
come on baby #

39:15.708 --> 39:19.167
# Have you ever had so
much fun in your life #

39:19.317 --> 39:24.475
# Have you ever,
have you ever baby #

39:24.625 --> 39:27.542
# Have you ever had so
much fun in your life #

39:27.692 --> 39:28.975
# Oooh #

39:29.125 --> 39:32.333
# Have you ever had so
much fun in your life #

39:32.483 --> 39:33.850
# So much, so
much fun #

39:34.000 --> 39:36.792
# Have you ever had so
much fun in your life #

39:36.942 --> 39:38.183
# Oooh #

39:38.333 --> 39:42.917
# Have you ever had so
much fun in your life #

39:48.542 --> 39:50.833
That was fun.
- Yeah.

39:50.983 --> 39:51.875
It was.

39:53.917 --> 39:55.583
I got an idea.
Wait a sec.

39:55.733 --> 39:56.583
Where are
you going?

39:59.917 --> 40:02.208
Hey, do you mind if I
borrow this for a second?

40:02.358 --> 40:02.917
Thanks.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.600
Hey everybody.

40:04.750 --> 40:07.000
I got a special treat
for you guys tonight.

40:07.150 --> 40:08.267
No, no, no.

40:08.417 --> 40:10.667
She's a very talented young
lady who is just going to

40:10.817 --> 40:12.708
melt your hearts, just
like she does mine.

40:15.875 --> 40:18.375
So everyone, put your
hands together for Nancy!

40:18.525 --> 40:19.375
Come on.

40:22.125 --> 40:23.292
Come on.

40:25.125 --> 40:26.017
What are
you doing?

40:26.167 --> 40:27.458
Well, you said you
wanted to sing.

40:27.608 --> 40:28.308
Yeah I do.

40:28.458 --> 40:30.820
But I sing in front of, like,
my family and friends.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.333
Oh, come on. Well, we're all
family and friends here.

40:33.483 --> 40:37.142
I mean look, there's
Mary-Jane and there's Chip,

40:37.292 --> 40:43.167
and Justin, and Megan and
Heather and, I can keep going.

40:43.317 --> 40:45.292
Okay, okay.
Alright.

40:45.442 --> 40:46.417
Come on guys.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.625
So, we'll start slow, just
follow me in the chorus.

41:02.708 --> 41:05.667
Uh, hi everybody,
I'm Nancy.

41:07.750 --> 41:08.933
Okay, um.

41:09.083 --> 41:12.042
When I point at you guys,
I want you to sing,

41:12.192 --> 41:13.475
# Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh.

41:13.625 --> 41:14.696
Can you guys
do that?

41:14.846 --> 41:16.514
Okay let's
try it.

41:16.664 --> 41:18.333
# Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh

41:18.483 --> 41:19.750
Perfect.

41:22.292 --> 41:27.083
# Today's the day I hit
the ground running #

41:27.233 --> 41:29.125
# Straight to
Tennessee #

41:29.275 --> 41:31.017
# Guitar is
all I need #

41:31.167 --> 41:35.958
# I've been dreaming
this dream forever #

41:36.108 --> 41:38.225
# I'm finally
waking up #

41:38.375 --> 41:40.558
# Cause safety
nets are just #

41:40.708 --> 41:42.833
# Something that's
getting in my way #

41:42.983 --> 41:45.625
# From making my
own history #

41:45.775 --> 41:47.666
# I'm breaking
chains #

41:47.816 --> 41:49.708
# It's got me
singing #

41:49.858 --> 41:51.792
# Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh #

41:51.942 --> 41:53.392
Great!

41:53.542 --> 41:58.875
# I'm alive, life is a ride
what makes you feel alive #

41:59.025 --> 42:02.458
# Ohhh-ohhh-ohhh #

42:02.608 --> 42:08.225
# I'm alive #

42:08.375 --> 42:10.392
# I wanna
celebrate today #

42:10.542 --> 42:13.392
# Make hay when the
sun's throwin' rays #

42:13.542 --> 42:17.250
# Thank the good Lord,
every time I pray, singin' #

42:17.400 --> 42:22.517
# Ohhh-ohhh
I'm alive #

42:22.667 --> 42:24.350
Yeah, I know, I
know, I know.

42:24.500 --> 42:27.292
# My momma raised me on
a hug no handshake #

42:27.442 --> 42:28.167
Alright, alright.

42:29.417 --> 42:31.250
Good night.
I love you.

42:33.292 --> 42:36.000
So, I talked to my parents,
they were a little pissed

42:36.150 --> 42:37.433
but I told them
I was better off

42:37.583 --> 42:39.667
with one boy than
a cabin full of them.

42:39.817 --> 42:41.058
They understood.

42:41.208 --> 42:42.529
Did you talk to
your sister-in-law?

42:42.679 --> 42:44.000
Yup. You're all good
to stay there.

42:44.150 --> 42:44.917
Okay, good.

42:45.958 --> 42:48.167
They don't have
any pets, do they?

42:48.317 --> 42:49.667
You're not allergic,
are you?

42:49.817 --> 42:50.750
Only to cats.

42:52.875 --> 42:55.821
Charlie, I'm like,
really allergic to cats.

42:55.971 --> 42:58.917
I guess we're staying
at my place, then.

42:59.067 --> 42:59.583
What? No.

43:01.042 --> 43:04.000
Come on, we're both adults
and I ain't gonna do nothin'.

43:04.150 --> 43:05.792
Besides, I'm the one
who should be worried.

43:05.942 --> 43:07.308
Excuse me?

43:07.458 --> 43:11.167
A stranger, staying
at my place?

43:11.317 --> 43:12.308
Where are
you going?

43:12.458 --> 43:14.583
What, are you planning
on sleeping in the truck?

43:14.733 --> 43:16.083
My apartment's
up here.

43:16.233 --> 43:17.167
Oh. You live here?

43:18.542 --> 43:21.708
What, is it not fancy
enough for you, city girl?

43:21.858 --> 43:24.250
Want me to roll
out the red carpet?

43:25.750 --> 43:27.392
Come on.

43:27.542 --> 43:29.583
It's usually a lot
cleaner than this.

43:29.733 --> 43:30.600
Oh I bet.

43:30.750 --> 43:32.383
But picking up a couple
pieces of laundry

43:32.533 --> 43:34.337
isn't going to really
make a difference.

43:34.487 --> 43:36.292
I can't unsee what
I've already seen.

43:36.442 --> 43:37.558
Perfect.

43:37.708 --> 43:40.667
Okay, the bathroom's over
there, and this is the bed.

43:40.817 --> 43:42.225
And where am I
going to sleep?

43:42.375 --> 43:44.583
Or I could just make a
pallet out of all

43:44.733 --> 43:45.583
of your laundry
on the floor.

43:45.733 --> 43:46.392
Don't be silly.

43:46.542 --> 43:47.517
You're going to
sleep on the bed

43:47.667 --> 43:49.375
and I'll sleep in the
truck downstairs.

43:49.525 --> 43:50.625
Charlie you don't
have to do that.

43:50.775 --> 43:54.083
Perfect, gentleman.
Remember?

43:55.792 --> 43:58.125
Okay. Good night.

43:58.275 --> 43:59.042
Good night.

44:09.125 --> 44:11.250
Okay let's tuck you
in boy, come on.

44:11.400 --> 44:12.167
I love you.

44:13.583 --> 44:14.917
Mommy.
- Yeah?

44:15.542 --> 44:17.000
Do you miss dad?

44:18.333 --> 44:20.841
From the second
he left, sweetie.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.500
Why does he always
have to go?

44:24.833 --> 44:25.583
Well,

44:26.958 --> 44:30.208
sometimes people who live
in other places don't have

44:30.358 --> 44:32.100
the same things or
opportunities that we have

44:32.250 --> 44:34.458
and they can't help themselves,
so that means that daddy

44:34.608 --> 44:37.392
has to travel really far
away to help them.

44:37.542 --> 44:40.875
But I promise you, no matter
how far away he travels,

44:41.025 --> 44:43.250
he's thinking about
you this very moment.

44:43.400 --> 44:44.058
Good.

44:44.208 --> 44:46.125
Cause I think
about him, too.

44:46.275 --> 44:48.000
Good, now go
to sleep.

44:48.150 --> 44:49.500
I love you.

44:49.650 --> 44:50.850
Mommy.
- Yeah?

44:51.000 --> 44:52.833
Can you leave
the light on?

44:54.208 --> 44:55.529
Sure, sweetie.

44:55.679 --> 44:58.167
Good night.

45:18.333 --> 45:21.175
# I've spent so
many evenings #

45:21.325 --> 45:24.167
# On just one
side of the bed #

45:24.317 --> 45:27.517
# Saving a
place for you #

45:27.667 --> 45:31.333
# One-sided
conversations wondering #

45:31.483 --> 45:34.666
# What you
might've said #

45:34.816 --> 45:37.850
# I bet you do
that too #

45:38.000 --> 45:43.279
# It always seems life
gets in the way #

45:43.429 --> 45:48.558
# But isn't this our
choice to make #

45:48.708 --> 45:53.792
# What if all the clocks
were suddenly broken #

45:53.942 --> 45:58.308
# Then time couldn't
tell us when to go #

45:58.458 --> 46:03.375
# What if we forgot what's
standing between us #

46:03.525 --> 46:08.208
# We wouldn't be
so all alone #

46:08.358 --> 46:12.625
# What could
I say #

46:12.775 --> 46:17.042
# To have
you stay #

46:24.542 --> 46:26.958
# Oh, God, what's
happenin' to me #

46:27.108 --> 46:30.683
# I've got too
much goin' on #

46:30.833 --> 46:34.292
# But there's somethin'
about this girl #

46:34.442 --> 46:37.437
# I'm workin' day
in, day out #

46:37.587 --> 46:40.802
# I find my time
is just gone #

46:40.952 --> 46:44.017
# But could she
change my world #

46:44.167 --> 46:49.550
# Not sure if she's even
thinkin' 'bout me #

46:49.700 --> 46:54.483
# Just play it cool,
take a breath and see #

46:54.633 --> 46:59.417
# What if all the clocks
were suddenly broken #

46:59.567 --> 47:04.267
# Then time couldn't
tell us when to go #

47:04.417 --> 47:09.375
# What if we forgot what's
standing between us #

47:09.525 --> 47:14.183
# We wouldn't be
so all alone #

47:14.333 --> 47:22.583
# What could I say,
to have you stay #

47:30.917 --> 47:33.696
# I don't know
what I'm doin' #

47:33.846 --> 47:36.625
# It's outta some
sort of dream #

47:36.775 --> 47:40.392
# How did I
get here, oh #

47:40.542 --> 47:43.425
# My thoughts are
all about him #

47:43.575 --> 47:47.046
# But tell me how
can that be #

47:47.196 --> 47:50.517
# I like him,
that's clear #

47:50.667 --> 47:55.842
# Sometimes a door's
put in front of you #

47:55.992 --> 48:00.879
# Do you keep it closed,
or walk on through #

48:01.029 --> 48:05.917
# What if all the clocks
were suddenly broken #

48:06.067 --> 48:10.683
# Then time couldn't
tell us when to go #

48:10.833 --> 48:15.750
# What if we forgot what's
standing between us #

48:15.900 --> 48:20.708
# We wouldn't be
so all alone #

48:20.858 --> 48:24.562
# What could
I say #

48:24.712 --> 48:28.968
# What would
I say #

48:29.118 --> 48:35.225
# To have
you stay #

48:35.375 --> 48:40.196
# Yeah, to have
you stay #

48:40.346 --> 48:45.167
# Ohhh what
if I stayed #

49:01.708 --> 49:02.642
Morning, Charlie.

49:02.792 --> 49:05.625
Did you get locked
out of your house?

49:05.775 --> 49:06.542
Nope.

49:07.250 --> 49:08.917
I have a visitor.

49:09.067 --> 49:10.167
A visitor?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.042
Didn't go so
well, huh?

49:14.500 --> 49:15.758
Thanks, Barney.

49:15.908 --> 49:17.017
No problem.

49:17.167 --> 49:18.292
You have a
good one okay?

49:18.442 --> 49:19.767
You too, Charlie.

49:19.917 --> 49:21.833
Better luck
next time!

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I didn't know it was
going to cost so much.

49:34.150 --> 49:35.017
I just can't...

49:35.167 --> 49:36.267
I know,
Mrs. McIntyre.

49:36.417 --> 49:37.542
Don't worry about it,
it's okay.

49:37.692 --> 49:38.642
Just pay me
what you can.

49:38.792 --> 49:39.800
MRS. McINTYRE:
Oh dear, Charlie.

49:39.950 --> 49:40.958
Can you, can you
afford that?

49:41.108 --> 49:41.933
For you
anything.

49:42.083 --> 49:43.875
But you do owe me one
of those homemade

49:44.025 --> 49:45.187
peach cobbler
pies, okay?

49:45.337 --> 49:46.500
MRS. McINTYRE:
You got it!

49:46.650 --> 49:47.600
Come here.

49:47.750 --> 49:48.458
Give me
some sugar.

49:50.792 --> 49:52.142
Okay.

49:52.292 --> 49:54.333
Okay, you drive
home safe, now.

49:54.483 --> 49:55.917
And give my
best to Harry.

50:00.542 --> 50:01.875
Good morning.

50:02.025 --> 50:02.642
Morning.

50:02.792 --> 50:03.725
How'd ya sleep?

50:03.875 --> 50:05.216
Good.
How about you?

50:05.366 --> 50:06.558
Like a frog
in a bog.

50:06.708 --> 50:08.292
I fixed your car
this morning.

50:08.442 --> 50:09.333
Wow! Already?

50:09.483 --> 50:10.308
Thanks.

50:10.458 --> 50:11.925
You act like I
wasn't gonna fix it.

50:12.075 --> 50:13.483
Like I was going
to keep you here

50:13.633 --> 50:14.892
against your will
indefinitely.

50:15.042 --> 50:17.792
Well, don't tell me it
didn't cross your mind.

50:21.625 --> 50:22.792
Your chariot awaits.

50:22.942 --> 50:23.808
Thanks.

50:23.958 --> 50:24.904
How much do
I owe you?

50:25.054 --> 50:26.000
Don't worry
about it.

50:26.150 --> 50:27.687
Charlie.

50:27.837 --> 50:29.225
It's okay.

50:29.375 --> 50:31.875
Hey, do you wanna get some
breakfast before you run?

50:32.025 --> 50:34.083
I shouldn't, I should
really get going.

50:34.233 --> 50:35.933
Of course.

50:36.083 --> 50:38.583
But last
night was...

50:38.733 --> 50:39.875
Nice.

50:40.025 --> 50:41.017
Yeah.

50:41.167 --> 50:43.342
If you're ever
in the city.

50:43.492 --> 50:45.667
Well I'm never
in the city.

50:47.333 --> 50:49.750
But now I have
a reason to.

50:49.900 --> 50:51.125
Great.

50:51.275 --> 50:52.458
Good.

50:52.608 --> 50:54.750
Okay.

51:01.167 --> 51:02.750
It's just...

51:10.417 --> 51:12.750
It was nice meeting
you, Charlie Bishop.

51:23.208 --> 51:24.208
Bye.

51:27.583 --> 51:29.583
Are you excited to
talk to your dad?

51:29.733 --> 51:31.208
I'll bet not as
much as I am.

51:31.358 --> 51:32.958
Ahh! There
he is!

51:36.042 --> 51:37.958
Hi baby!
- Katherine?

51:38.108 --> 51:39.308
Hey, how are you?

51:39.458 --> 51:41.292
Hey, sweating like a
pig in a porkhouse.

51:41.442 --> 51:42.808
How are you guys?

51:42.958 --> 51:44.487
We're good,
we're good.

51:44.637 --> 51:46.017
Hi, dad.
- Hey soldier.

51:46.167 --> 51:47.750
God, I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

51:47.900 --> 51:49.225
When you
coming home?

51:49.375 --> 51:52.458
My birthday is in two weeks, so
I need you to make hamburgers,

51:52.608 --> 51:54.292
'cause mom's
aren't as good.

51:54.442 --> 51:55.642
Ouch, buddy!

51:55.792 --> 51:57.958
What? It's the truth,
even dad knows it.

51:58.108 --> 51:59.433
Soon, son.

51:59.583 --> 52:02.125
But until I am, you're the
man of the house, okay?

52:02.275 --> 52:03.142
And, you know,
with mom's help,

52:03.292 --> 52:05.500
you can flip those
patties on the grill.

52:05.650 --> 52:06.558
Okay, I'll try.

52:06.708 --> 52:08.320
I love you
guys so much.

52:08.470 --> 52:09.933
I'm thinking
about you

52:10.083 --> 52:13.000
every second of every
hour of every day.

52:13.150 --> 52:14.542
I love you
too, dad.

52:14.692 --> 52:16.083
Bye.

52:20.125 --> 52:21.258
So how is it
out there?

52:21.408 --> 52:22.542
Are you
keeping safe?

52:23.458 --> 52:24.667
You know me right?

52:25.667 --> 52:27.279
No risks.

52:27.429 --> 52:28.892
Right.

52:29.042 --> 52:33.183
# Crimson sky meets
the land #

52:33.333 --> 52:39.833
# Great spirit hands pull
down the dying sun #

52:39.983 --> 52:44.933
# Secrets blow
through the trees #

52:45.083 --> 52:51.058
# On the breeze I hear
the ancient drums #

52:51.208 --> 52:57.042
# I will lay down my fear,
to find out right here #

52:57.192 --> 53:02.792
# What I'm made of
deep down inside #

53:02.942 --> 53:05.792
# And my heart
sings once more #

53:05.942 --> 53:08.225
# On a far
distant shore #

53:08.375 --> 53:13.208
# And the song tells
me I have arrived #

53:13.358 --> 53:15.708
Hey, how's my
baby brother doing?

53:15.858 --> 53:16.642
Staying out
of trouble?

53:16.792 --> 53:18.708
Actually, I'm not
so sure about that.

53:18.858 --> 53:20.792
He uh, he found
himself a girl.

53:20.942 --> 53:22.183
No!
- Yes.

53:22.333 --> 53:24.000
I haven't met her yet,
but from what I can tell,

53:24.150 --> 53:25.083
he actually really
likes this one.

53:25.233 --> 53:26.600
Well I'll be!

53:26.750 --> 53:28.958
You talk to him, you tell him
that's the right kinda trouble.

53:29.108 --> 53:29.933
I will.

53:30.083 --> 53:33.195
And you also tell him if he
found the girl of his dreams,

53:33.345 --> 53:36.458
to do what his big brother
did, and never let her go.

53:36.608 --> 53:37.850
Hey, Cody we
gotta go.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.583
Ah, ok, sorry Katherine,
I gotta, I gotta go.

53:41.733 --> 53:42.975
Already?

53:43.125 --> 53:44.833
Yeah, we're heading out
soon and I gotta get ready.

53:44.983 --> 53:47.270
Okay, I love you.

53:47.420 --> 53:49.135
I love you too.

53:49.285 --> 53:50.850
Please be safe.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.333
Hey buddy, say bye to
your dad, honey. Come on.

53:56.250 --> 53:57.375
Bye dad.

53:58.250 --> 54:00.083
We love
you, honey.

54:00.233 --> 54:01.292
Ok, bye.

54:02.458 --> 54:06.767
# Crimson sky

Take cover!

54:30.250 --> 54:31.000
Hit.

54:33.042 --> 54:34.375
Contact right!

54:38.042 --> 54:39.375
Moving!

54:42.875 --> 54:43.708
Contact left!

54:52.750 --> 54:53.392
RPG!

54:53.542 --> 54:54.917
Roof one o'clock!

55:01.375 --> 55:03.833
So, how do
I look?

55:03.983 --> 55:05.100
Handsome.

55:05.250 --> 55:06.183
Very handsome.

55:06.333 --> 55:07.625
You look good,
Uncle Charlie.

55:07.775 --> 55:08.517
Good?

55:08.667 --> 55:09.725
I gotta look
better than good, pal.

55:09.875 --> 55:11.333
So where are you
going tonight, anyways?

55:11.483 --> 55:13.042
She texted me.
Some club downtown.

55:13.192 --> 55:14.017
You're not
driving, right?

55:14.167 --> 55:15.500
No, ma'am. Wouldn't
dream of it.

55:15.650 --> 55:16.850
Good.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.675
Better than good.

55:18.825 --> 55:20.350
A million bucks.

55:20.500 --> 55:21.417
You talking with
Cody tonight?

55:22.500 --> 55:23.667
Yeah, eight
o'clock sharp.

55:23.817 --> 55:24.725
Right on the dot.

55:24.875 --> 55:26.125
Well, tell him
I say hi.

55:26.275 --> 55:27.292
I will.

55:29.458 --> 55:30.716
Hey, what's
wrong?

55:30.866 --> 55:31.975
Oh, God, I
don't know.

55:32.125 --> 55:34.966
I just, um, I haven't really
been sleeping very well,

55:35.116 --> 55:37.958
and, um, I just keep getting
this silly feeling, that...

55:38.108 --> 55:39.808
Hey.
He'll be fine.

55:39.958 --> 55:43.125
He promised he'd
come back, remember?

55:43.275 --> 55:45.500
Cody always keeps
his promises.

55:45.650 --> 55:46.416
Right?

55:46.566 --> 55:47.333
Right.

55:49.208 --> 55:50.392
See you
around, man.

55:50.542 --> 55:52.292
Hey, behave
yourself tonight.

55:53.417 --> 55:54.517
I'm a Bishop.

55:54.667 --> 55:57.375
How much trouble could
I possibly get into?

55:57.525 --> 55:59.750
I'm not going
to answer that.

55:59.900 --> 56:01.583
Probably for
the best.

56:46.167 --> 56:48.125
Yeah, can I
get a beer?

56:52.333 --> 56:53.167
Thanks.

57:05.625 --> 57:08.175
# Hey sweet thing where
you been all my life #

57:08.325 --> 57:10.875
# Do you come here often,
baby what's your sign #

57:13.833 --> 57:16.167
# I've heard 'em all
'bout a thousand times #

57:16.317 --> 57:19.083
# The same old tacky,
unoriginal lines #

57:22.750 --> 57:24.417
# We're fed up,
we've had enough #

57:24.567 --> 57:26.308
# And there's
no doubt #

57:26.458 --> 57:30.458
# So boys stay clear, sit back
here and shut your mouth #

57:30.608 --> 57:33.083
# And you're just in time
for the jaded woman #

57:33.233 --> 57:34.975
# One by one gonna
watch'em fall #

57:35.125 --> 57:37.500
# Tough as nails she
won't be persuaded #

57:37.650 --> 57:40.375
# Jaded woman gonna
crush 'em all #

57:47.792 --> 57:50.217
# A broken heart says
there's just no way #

57:50.367 --> 57:52.792
# Every one of you boys
gonna have to wait #

57:56.083 --> 57:58.445
# Could be a while 'til
the walls come down #

57:58.595 --> 58:00.958
# Too bad for the next
fool who comes around #

58:04.750 --> 58:08.458
# Look out now we're just
about to take control #

58:08.608 --> 58:10.833
# Stay in your sweet,
front row seat #

58:10.983 --> 58:12.517
# And watch
the show #

58:12.667 --> 58:15.125
# And you're just in time
for the jaded woman #

58:15.275 --> 58:17.142
# One by one gonna
watch'em fall #

58:17.292 --> 58:19.625
# Tough as nails she
won't be persuaded #

58:19.775 --> 58:21.917
# Jaded woman gonna
crush 'em all #

58:38.833 --> 58:40.083
Hello?

58:41.167 --> 58:43.100
He didn't
call, Charlie.

58:43.250 --> 58:44.475
What do you mean
he didn't call?

58:44.625 --> 58:46.625
I was waiting by the
computer like I always do,

58:46.775 --> 58:48.958
me and Cody Jr., and
he never came online!

58:49.108 --> 58:51.292
Calm down Katherine.
You know, things don't

58:51.442 --> 58:53.083
always run on
schedule, it's ok.

58:53.233 --> 58:55.392
No, but, are
you sure?

58:55.542 --> 58:58.333
You have nothing to be afraid
of, you understand me?

59:00.375 --> 59:04.958
Oh, I'm sorry. You're on a date.
Ummm, go have fun and um,

59:05.108 --> 59:07.125
I'm sure
he'll call.

59:07.275 --> 59:08.333
He will.

59:09.125 --> 59:10.392
Okay, I gotta
go now,

59:10.542 --> 59:12.417
but I'll call you first thing
tomorrow morning, ok?

59:12.567 --> 59:14.125
And text me when
you hear from him.

59:14.275 --> 59:16.542
Yeah I will.
Okay, bye.

59:16.692 --> 59:18.375
Bye.

59:24.625 --> 59:30.758
# If you got the guts
step right up #

59:30.908 --> 59:37.042
# She's no easy prize,
look in her eyes #

59:55.583 --> 59:59.583
# We're fed up, we've had
enough and there's no doubt #

59:59.733 --> 01:00:01.833
# So boys stay clear,
sit back here #

01:00:01.983 --> 01:00:03.792
# And shut
your mouth #

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.583
# And you're just in time
for the jaded woman #

01:00:08.733 --> 01:00:10.350
# One by one gonna
watch 'em fall #

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.000
# Tough as nails she
won't be persuaded #

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:14.958
# Jaded woman gonna
crush 'em all #

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:19.558
# No No No #

01:00:19.708 --> 01:00:22.792
# Won't be persuaded #

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:27.800
#Jaded, jaded woman #

01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:31.125
# Crush 'em all #

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:34.667
Get lost.

01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:42.917
No no no, man, we do it all
in-house and then we jack up

01:00:43.067 --> 01:00:44.808
our overhead costs
by ten-fold.

01:00:44.958 --> 01:00:47.058
You wouldn't believe
how well we're doing.

01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:49.792
And some of the girls bringing
in their demos to my studio?

01:00:49.942 --> 01:00:50.833
It's insane.

01:00:52.292 --> 01:00:55.167
Hey, and get this, I get the
front desk to make sure

01:00:55.317 --> 01:00:56.875
that they leave
a headshot.

01:00:57.025 --> 01:00:58.500
Yeah, yeah, exactly!

01:01:00.208 --> 01:01:00.917
What?

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.808
No no no, man,
that was last week,

01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:06.625
well, yeah, she was a wild
ride, but her music sucked.

01:01:08.417 --> 01:01:10.100
Yup, for sure!

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:13.750
Hey, I gotta go, I'm surprising
the regular tonight.

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.542
Yeah, alright later.

01:01:17.167 --> 01:01:20.125
Wild ride?
The regular?

01:01:21.292 --> 01:01:23.258
If my mom ever heard
me talk like that,

01:01:23.408 --> 01:01:25.375
she'd wash my mouth
out with a bar of soap.

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:29.946
Well, I guess it's a good thing
that your mom's not here.

01:01:30.096 --> 01:01:33.285
You know, I think it's just
kinda sad that talent has to

01:01:33.435 --> 01:01:36.625
take a backseat to mandatory
prostitution at your studio.

01:01:36.775 --> 01:01:38.208
What you're doing, it
doesn't take a saint

01:01:38.358 --> 01:01:39.833
to know that it
ain't right.

01:01:41.042 --> 01:01:44.625
Listen, kid, there
is no right.

01:01:44.775 --> 01:01:46.267
There's no
wrong anymore.

01:01:46.417 --> 01:01:49.542
There's only what you want,
and what you're willing to do

01:01:49.692 --> 01:01:51.000
to get what
you want.

01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:59.042
Oh, and uh, you shouldn't listen
to other people's conversations.

01:01:59.192 --> 01:02:01.083
And you shouldn't
talk so loud.

01:02:14.833 --> 01:02:15.958
Nancy!

01:02:16.458 --> 01:02:17.633
Charlie!

01:02:17.783 --> 01:02:18.958
You came.

01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:22.708
You remember
my friend Ains?

01:02:22.858 --> 01:02:23.792
Yeah, of course.
Hi.

01:02:23.942 --> 01:02:24.517
Hey.

01:02:24.667 --> 01:02:26.125
Uh, sit down!
Sit down.

01:02:27.167 --> 01:02:28.517
Hey, sweetie!

01:02:28.667 --> 01:02:30.583
Brad! What are you
doing here?

01:02:30.733 --> 01:02:31.250
Surprise.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.042
I thought that you said
that you were going

01:02:34.192 --> 01:02:35.183
to that gig in the
Arts District?

01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:38.125
Oh, we did. But it was
so awful we left.

01:02:38.275 --> 01:02:39.021
Oh, okay.

01:02:39.171 --> 01:02:39.767
Umm, cool!

01:02:39.917 --> 01:02:41.267
This is my
friend Charlie,

01:02:41.417 --> 01:02:45.375
Charlie, this is my boyfriend
Brad, and this is Mark.

01:02:45.525 --> 01:02:46.292
Of course.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.125
Great to meet
you, man.

01:02:49.275 --> 01:02:50.500
Nice to meet you.

01:02:53.625 --> 01:02:56.792
And uh, how exactly do we,
uh, know Charlie again?

01:02:56.942 --> 01:02:58.437
Oh, Charlie is the
guy who fixed my car

01:02:58.587 --> 01:03:00.083
and kind of got me
around last week.

01:03:00.233 --> 01:03:01.667
Yeah, so sweet.

01:03:01.817 --> 01:03:02.892
Wow.

01:03:03.042 --> 01:03:04.917
You came all this way
just to see the pretty girl

01:03:05.067 --> 01:03:06.250
whose car you
fixed, huh?

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.683
That is sweet.

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:10.750
Sounds like your mother raised
you to be a perfect gentleman.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.833
I guess they just don't make
them like they used to.

01:03:12.983 --> 01:03:13.850
We're a
dying breed.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.500
I was talking
about her car.

01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:18.083
And what is it that
you two do again?

01:03:18.233 --> 01:03:19.433
Well we're in
the music biz.

01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:21.683
Uh, I'm a producer, and,
Mark works for me.

01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:24.042
Yeah, Brad is the producer I was
telling you I was working with.

01:03:24.192 --> 01:03:25.896
Oh is that so? And
how did you two meet?

01:03:26.046 --> 01:03:27.600
It's actually kind
of a funny story.

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.767
I was looking at this
music magazine blog,

01:03:29.917 --> 01:03:32.625
and I saw that this new
local label was opening up.

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:34.500
They don't normally take
unsolicited materials

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:35.666
but I thought,
why not?

01:03:35.816 --> 01:03:36.683
Wait, let
me guess.

01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:39.250
When you got to the front
desk, they asked you to leave

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.916
a headshot with your demo,
and when you did,

01:03:42.066 --> 01:03:44.583
Brad's the one who called
you to bring you in.

01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:46.292
How did you
know that?

01:03:46.442 --> 01:03:47.542
Just a hunch.

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:50.583
You know what,
I should go. I'm imposing.

01:03:50.733 --> 01:03:51.750
No, Charlie.
Stay.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.917
Yes Charlie, stay.

01:03:55.042 --> 01:03:56.000
I'm sorry.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:58.308
He's probably out
of his element,

01:03:58.458 --> 01:03:59.833
you know, used to handling
farm animals or something

01:03:59.983 --> 01:04:01.142
a little less
complicated.

01:04:01.292 --> 01:04:04.167
Look, Nancy, your boyfriend,
he's a real piece of work.

01:04:04.317 --> 01:04:06.396
I had the pleasure of
overhearing his conversation

01:04:06.546 --> 01:04:08.625
in the bathroom telling his
buddy all about how he

01:04:08.775 --> 01:04:10.308
"manages the
studio."

01:04:10.458 --> 01:04:12.125
I'm not even going to
tell you half the things

01:04:12.275 --> 01:04:13.416
that he said
but I...

01:04:13.566 --> 01:04:14.708
You just
deserve better.

01:04:14.858 --> 01:04:15.475
Okay?

01:04:15.625 --> 01:04:16.966
You deserve
better than him.

01:04:17.116 --> 01:04:18.458
Nancy, is this
kid for real?

01:04:18.608 --> 01:04:19.683
Brad, hold on.

01:04:19.833 --> 01:04:21.917
Charlie, I don't know what
you think that you heard,

01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:23.750
but Mark and Brad have
been really helpful

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.021
to me at the label.

01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:26.142
It's a good
company.

01:04:26.292 --> 01:04:27.833
Dude, what do you know
about business anyway?

01:04:27.983 --> 01:04:28.812
You're a car
mechanic.

01:04:28.962 --> 01:04:29.642
I own my
own shop.

01:04:29.792 --> 01:04:30.892
Well, maybe you should
run back to it,

01:04:31.042 --> 01:04:32.917
because you're clearly
upsetting my girlfriend.

01:04:33.067 --> 01:04:33.792
Don't you mean
"the regular"?

01:04:35.333 --> 01:04:38.250
I mean, that is how you
referred to her on the phone.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.433
What's he
talking about?

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:41.500
Don't listen to him, he's
completely misconstrued

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:42.600
my entire
conversation.

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:44.125
Nancy, can I please
talk to you in private?

01:04:44.275 --> 01:04:45.000
No, you
may not.

01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:45.725
Nancy?

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:47.142
Guess his bumpkin
upbringing

01:04:47.292 --> 01:04:49.125
failed to teach him
a lick of manners.

01:04:49.275 --> 01:04:50.017
Excuse me?

01:04:50.167 --> 01:04:51.571
I said your country
bumpkin mother

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.125
should've taught
you some manners.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Stand up.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:57.683
What?

01:04:57.833 --> 01:04:59.154
I said stand up.

01:04:59.304 --> 01:05:00.625
Is he for real?

01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:03.208
I'm out of here.

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:04.333
Charlie!

01:05:04.483 --> 01:05:05.308
Please?

01:05:05.458 --> 01:05:06.958
Fine, I'll
handle it.

01:05:07.108 --> 01:05:08.041
Hey Charlie!

01:05:08.191 --> 01:05:09.125
Hold up, man.

01:05:10.458 --> 01:05:12.362
We got off on the
wrong foot, okay?

01:05:12.512 --> 01:05:14.417
Come on back, I'll
buy you a drink.

01:05:14.567 --> 01:05:16.850
Okay?
See?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.925
No harm.
No foul.

01:05:19.075 --> 01:05:21.000
Besides, bro-code.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:22.708
We can share.

01:05:24.167 --> 01:05:24.875
Brad!

01:05:25.792 --> 01:05:26.892
Brad!

01:05:27.042 --> 01:05:28.833
Hey, I'm out of here,
you're not my brother.

01:05:28.983 --> 01:05:30.750
Charlie, Charlie!

01:05:32.542 --> 01:05:34.125
Charlie!

01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:39.167
Did she seriously
just leave with him?

01:05:39.317 --> 01:05:40.517
Charlie, what the
hell was that?!

01:05:40.667 --> 01:05:42.833
Your boyfriend's a liar and
you deserve so much better.

01:05:42.983 --> 01:05:44.183
I mean, how can
you not see it?

01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:46.417
It's like your eternal
optimism overshadows

01:05:46.567 --> 01:05:47.958
your really bad
judgment of character.

01:05:48.108 --> 01:05:49.058
What are you
talking about?

01:05:49.208 --> 01:05:50.458
He's seeing other
people, Nancy!

01:05:52.333 --> 01:05:54.225
I heard him
on the phone.

01:05:54.375 --> 01:05:57.175
He called another
girl a wild ride.

01:05:57.325 --> 01:05:59.975
I know he sees other
people, Charlie.

01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:01.683
But if I was really
that in love with him,

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:04.208
do you think I ever would've
kissed you in the first place?

01:06:04.358 --> 01:06:05.475
So then why are
you still with him?!

01:06:05.625 --> 01:06:08.404
Brad is helping me make
my first album, Charlie!

01:06:08.554 --> 01:06:11.333
Do you know how lucky I
was to have met him?!

01:06:11.483 --> 01:06:12.750
This could be
everything!

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:13.558
He's good
for me.

01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:15.267
Yeah, but he's
not good to you.

01:06:15.417 --> 01:06:18.708
His label is one of the fastest
growing in the entire city,

01:06:18.858 --> 01:06:20.354
he can really
help me.

01:06:20.504 --> 01:06:22.031
You don't need
his help.

01:06:22.181 --> 01:06:23.558
You are so
talented, Nancy!

01:06:23.708 --> 01:06:26.250
You can start small, work
your way up in the business.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.229
You can perform here,
perform anywhere!

01:06:28.379 --> 01:06:30.208
People will recognize
how talented you are

01:06:30.358 --> 01:06:31.333
and you will
make it.

01:06:31.483 --> 01:06:32.225
Just without him.

01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:34.154
It's not that
simple, Charlie.

01:06:34.304 --> 01:06:35.933
You're thinking
about it one way.

01:06:36.083 --> 01:06:38.542
Maybe where you're
from things are just...

01:06:40.042 --> 01:06:41.133
What?

01:06:41.283 --> 01:06:42.375
Small.

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.458
"Dreams have got to
be big", Charlie.

01:06:45.608 --> 01:06:46.600
Your words,
not mine.

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:48.250
Yeah, but not when it
compromises who you are,

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.267
and what you
believe in.

01:06:49.417 --> 01:06:50.600
You don't have to
sell yourself.

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:53.375
At least I'm fighting
for what I believe in!

01:06:53.525 --> 01:06:54.767
That's more than I
can say for you.

01:06:54.917 --> 01:06:57.875
Besides, I haven't slept with
him, I'm not compromising...

01:06:58.025 --> 01:06:58.933
That's just details.

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:01.958
Yeah, that's what
life is, Charlie. Details.

01:07:02.108 --> 01:07:03.975
Not the broad strokes
you think it is.

01:07:04.125 --> 01:07:06.375
Brad and I, we have a good
time when we go out together.

01:07:06.525 --> 01:07:09.792
And I like working in the
studio with him and Mark.

01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:10.875
They believe
in me.

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:12.975
If he believes
in you,

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:15.708
then he'll make your
album regardless.

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:19.625
I can't risk that.

01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:23.708
You're better
than that.

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:26.904
I'm better than this.

01:07:27.054 --> 01:07:28.875
Whatever this is.

01:07:35.458 --> 01:07:38.333
# What's going
through your head #

01:07:38.483 --> 01:07:40.517
# All the things
I said #

01:07:40.667 --> 01:07:43.917
# Don't seem to get
through to you #

01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:47.820
# You read your
magazines #

01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:50.308
# Thinking up
these scenes #

01:07:50.458 --> 01:07:53.583
# Where someone comes
and rescues you #

01:07:53.733 --> 01:07:55.058
I never asked for
that, Charlie.

01:07:55.208 --> 01:08:00.458
# Not sure I can compete
with every fantasy #

01:08:00.608 --> 01:08:02.750
# That seems to take
control of you #

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:03.683
That's not fair.

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:05.517
That's not fair for
you to say that.

01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:12.612
# What happened to the real
sparks we used to feel #

01:08:12.762 --> 01:08:19.707
# When I had a hold of you
I'm giving all that I can #

01:08:19.858 --> 01:08:24.750
# You're chasing
dreams I can't follow #

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:29.457
# You're holding
love in your hands #

01:08:29.608 --> 01:08:34.167
# Don't throw away
sweet tomorrow #

01:08:34.317 --> 01:08:36.937
# Look into
my eyes #

01:08:37.087 --> 01:08:39.558
# Tell me what
you find #

01:08:39.707 --> 01:08:41.792
# Can't you see
what's happening #

01:08:41.942 --> 01:08:43.725
Charlie.

01:08:43.875 --> 01:08:48.957
# I'm slowly losing faith in
what I'm trying to save #

01:08:49.108 --> 01:08:51.832
# Can't you see you
might lose everything #

01:08:51.983 --> 01:08:55.354
This is about my
future, Charlie.

01:08:55.504 --> 01:08:58.725
# I'm giving all
that I can #

01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:03.716
# You're chasing
dreams I can't follow #

01:09:03.866 --> 01:09:08.712
# You're holding
love in your hands #

01:09:08.862 --> 01:09:13.707
# Don't throw away
sweet tomorrow #

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:18.350
# Ohh, nooo #

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:23.167
# Don't throw away
sweet tomorrow #

01:09:23.317 --> 01:09:27.792
# Come back to
what you were #

01:09:27.942 --> 01:09:32.267
# Come back into
my world #

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:36.125
# Where love ain't
make believe #

01:09:36.274 --> 01:09:38.725
# And you
will see #

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:46.625
# Reality is all
you need #

01:09:52.167 --> 01:09:54.042
A man like me.

01:09:56.542 --> 01:09:58.642
I'm sorry, Charlie.

01:09:58.792 --> 01:10:01.279
I think you
should go home.

01:10:01.429 --> 01:10:03.917
Nancy, you
don't need him.

01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:05.475
Come with me.

01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:07.500
You'll have to
work harder, yes.

01:10:08.958 --> 01:10:12.250
But I promise I'll be there
every step of the way.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.021
How do you know
that, Charlie?

01:10:14.171 --> 01:10:15.792
We had one
night together!

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.125
You don't
even know me.

01:10:18.275 --> 01:10:18.892
I do know you.

01:10:19.042 --> 01:10:20.433
Okay, maybe not
everything,

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:22.875
but I know what kind
of person you are.

01:10:23.025 --> 01:10:25.375
You can't deny
this connection.

01:10:25.525 --> 01:10:27.458
Yes, I can.

01:10:40.792 --> 01:10:45.517
# I'm giving all
that I can #

01:10:45.667 --> 01:10:50.467
# You're chasing
dreams I can't follow #

01:10:50.617 --> 01:10:55.504
# You're holding
love in your hands #

01:10:55.654 --> 01:11:00.542
# Don't throw away
sweet tomorrow #

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.267
Oh, hey, Mark.

01:11:17.417 --> 01:11:19.683
Um, have you
seen Brad?

01:11:19.833 --> 01:11:22.250
Brad had to run
back to the studio.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.517
And Ains went
with him?

01:11:23.667 --> 01:11:25.792
That guy who came
in here earlier.

01:11:25.942 --> 01:11:26.642
Charlie?

01:11:26.792 --> 01:11:30.083
He seems... pretty
crazy about you.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.341
You seem... kinda
crazy about him too.

01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:37.183
You know how
things are with Brad.

01:11:37.333 --> 01:11:39.758
I don't really want to
jeopardize anything.

01:11:39.908 --> 01:11:42.333
Nancy, your music is
only gonna be as good

01:11:42.483 --> 01:11:44.225
as your life
experience.

01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:47.392
You're a good writer, but
if you think that Brad

01:11:47.542 --> 01:11:51.750
is ever going to inspire you to
write anything truly great,

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:54.250
you'd probably
be wrong.

01:11:55.750 --> 01:12:00.292
The best music I ever made
came from my relationships.

01:12:00.442 --> 01:12:02.083
The real ones.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.042
The gigs, the
excitement?

01:12:06.375 --> 01:12:08.183
It comes
and goes.

01:12:08.333 --> 01:12:11.392
Success soars
and falls.

01:12:11.542 --> 01:12:17.000
The music is what stays
with us, besides love.

01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:19.167
Good night, Mark.

01:12:19.317 --> 01:12:20.875
Thanks.

01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:07.737
Ah, you taste sweet.

01:13:07.887 --> 01:13:09.292
Like what?

01:13:10.292 --> 01:13:12.000
Is that
passionfruit?

01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:13.125
Mm-hmm.

01:13:13.275 --> 01:13:14.250
Sexy.

01:13:15.833 --> 01:13:20.958
What do you say, baby, hmm? You
and me against the world?

01:13:21.108 --> 01:13:21.917
I say, yes.

01:13:23.292 --> 01:13:25.821
I'm sorry, we're gonna
need to do that one again.

01:13:25.971 --> 01:13:28.500
That last one reeked of
cliches and unoriginality.

01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:30.500
I mean, if you
guys don't feel it,

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:32.479
how am I supposed
to feel it?

01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:34.308
Try some real
emotion this time.

01:13:34.458 --> 01:13:38.542
It's supposed to penetrate the
skin, not make the skin crawl.

01:13:38.692 --> 01:13:40.725
Nance, it's not
what it looks like.

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:43.208
It is what it looks
like, but I'm drunk,

01:13:43.358 --> 01:13:44.600
I... I don't even care
about him.

01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:47.029
I'm the one who doesn't
care about you.

01:13:47.179 --> 01:13:49.458
Look, Nance...

01:13:50.875 --> 01:13:53.208
I can't hear you.

01:13:54.792 --> 01:13:56.708
Nancy! Nancy, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:13:56.858 --> 01:13:57.350
Don't touch me.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.683
Just let me
explain.

01:13:58.833 --> 01:13:59.725
There's nothing
to explain.

01:13:59.875 --> 01:14:01.362
I was angry, okay?
I made a mistake.

01:14:01.512 --> 01:14:03.000
But don't go
throw this all away.

01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:06.792
Just, don't.

01:14:36.042 --> 01:14:37.417
Hey buddy.

01:14:37.567 --> 01:14:38.417
Mom.

01:14:47.625 --> 01:14:49.542
Stay right
here, buddy.

01:16:03.333 --> 01:16:04.792
Bishop Towing.

01:16:40.792 --> 01:16:42.917
You said he
would be fine.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.154
You said he
would be fine!

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:52.458
Kat, it's going
to be okay.

01:16:54.417 --> 01:16:56.083
It's not okay.

01:16:56.233 --> 01:16:57.541
It's not.

01:16:57.691 --> 01:16:59.000
Okay.

01:17:22.083 --> 01:17:24.000
Let's put this
arm in first.

01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:24.667
Why?

01:17:25.583 --> 01:17:27.875
Why do I have to
wear this, mom?

01:17:30.083 --> 01:17:32.750
Because we have to look
good for daddy, honey.

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.375
Why? He's not
coming home.

01:17:39.417 --> 01:17:41.875
Your daddy is
home, baby.

01:17:52.792 --> 01:17:54.975
# Half awake today #

01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:58.112
# Can't help but
feel alone #

01:17:58.262 --> 01:18:01.431
# I swear I hear
you calling me #

01:18:01.581 --> 01:18:04.750
# But realize I'm
on my own #

01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:07.896
# Half asleep
at night #

01:18:08.046 --> 01:18:10.892
# Across an
empty bed #

01:18:11.042 --> 01:18:13.925
# I reach out and
touch the pillow #

01:18:14.075 --> 01:18:16.808
# Where you used to
lay your head #

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:22.750
# No one's to blame, still
it hurts just the same #

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:28.958
# You're the song
that haunts my soul #

01:18:29.108 --> 01:18:31.875
# That keeps me
up all night #

01:18:32.025 --> 01:18:36.583
# Because it's
still not right #

01:18:36.733 --> 01:18:41.142
# And how I long
to make it whole #

01:18:41.292 --> 01:18:50.417
# But you were meant to be
an unfinished symphony #

01:19:01.167 --> 01:19:03.517
# Walking on
the pier #

01:19:03.667 --> 01:19:06.758
# Getting caught
out in the rain #

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:10.000
# You just laughed
and took my hand #

01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:13.083
# As I kissed your
lips again #

01:19:13.233 --> 01:19:16.291
# It still makes
me smile #

01:19:16.441 --> 01:19:19.350
# When I think
about that day #

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:22.417
# It was you who made
my life complete #

01:19:22.567 --> 01:19:25.767
# I never thought
you'd go away #

01:19:25.917 --> 01:19:31.500
# No one's to blame, still
it hurts just the same #

01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:38.000
# You're the song
that haunts my soul #

01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:40.854
# That keeps me
up all night #

01:19:41.004 --> 01:19:45.343
# because it's
still not right #

01:19:45.493 --> 01:19:49.683
# And how I long to
make it whole #

01:19:49.833 --> 01:19:56.362
# But you were meant to be
an unfinished symphony #

01:19:56.512 --> 01:20:03.042
# Someday we'll be together,
a part of me believes #

01:20:03.192 --> 01:20:08.708
# But for now all I have,
are the memories #

01:20:13.583 --> 01:20:19.500
# You're the song
that haunts my soul #

01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:22.729
#That keeps me
up all night #

01:20:22.879 --> 01:20:27.385
# Because it's
still not right #

01:20:27.535 --> 01:20:32.042
# And how I long
to make it whole #

01:20:32.192 --> 01:20:38.000
# But you were
meant to be #

01:20:38.150 --> 01:20:43.958
# An unfinished
symphony #

01:21:14.917 --> 01:21:19.500
# You came from
out of nowhere #

01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:24.542
# Or that's what it
seemed to me #

01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:28.125
# If I'd've known,
you felt so strong #

01:21:28.275 --> 01:21:31.100
# Maybe I wouldn't
be alone #

01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:33.292
Hi I saw your sign
looking for a position.

01:21:33.442 --> 01:21:37.267
# I know you're the
one I need #

01:21:37.417 --> 01:21:40.417
# I never thought I'd
find the strength #

01:21:40.567 --> 01:21:42.958
# To make it
through this #

01:21:43.108 --> 01:21:45.083
# And if I saw
you now #

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:47.058
# Oh I'd tell
you how #

01:21:47.208 --> 01:21:50.925
# How much I was
afraid to admit #

01:21:51.075 --> 01:21:54.642
# So, don't tell
me this is it #

01:21:54.792 --> 01:21:59.500
# Cause I have so
much more to give #

01:21:59.650 --> 01:22:01.291
# Why won't you
come to me now #

01:22:01.441 --> 01:22:02.933
# Now that I'm on
solid ground #

01:22:03.083 --> 01:22:07.833
# No, don't say that we
don't have a chance #

01:22:07.983 --> 01:22:12.058
# At the perfect
night we once had #

01:22:12.208 --> 01:22:18.083
# If you care at all
don't leave me all alone #

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:21.725
# Oh baby, baby #

01:22:21.875 --> 01:22:25.000
# Why does it feel
that time's gone by #

01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:27.725
# So slow #

01:22:27.875 --> 01:22:30.958
# I wanna figure out how
to turn it all around #

01:22:31.108 --> 01:22:34.308
# Hell, I just
don't know #

01:22:34.458 --> 01:22:37.300
# At last I'm finally
turning the corner #

01:22:37.450 --> 01:22:40.212
# I want to move on, and
get on with my life #

01:22:40.362 --> 01:22:42.975
# Want you back in my
arms, make you mine #

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:46.625
# Step out of the darkness
to get to the light #

01:22:46.775 --> 01:22:54.167
# Yeah I'm so close #

01:22:55.333 --> 01:23:00.267
# So, don't tell
me this is it #

01:23:00.417 --> 01:23:05.083
# Cause I have so
much more to give #

01:23:05.233 --> 01:23:06.729
# Why won't you
come to me now #

01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:08.225
# Now that I'm on
solid ground #

01:23:08.375 --> 01:23:13.042
# No, don't make me
think we have no chance #

01:23:13.192 --> 01:23:17.517
# At the perfect
life we could have #

01:23:17.667 --> 01:23:23.417
# If you care at all, don't
leave me the hell alone #

01:23:23.567 --> 01:23:29.600
# Oh, wanting you is the
one true thing I know #

01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:36.292
# If we meant anything at
all, please don't let us go #

01:23:36.442 --> 01:23:44.625
# Oh baby, baby #

01:23:44.775 --> 01:23:52.958
# Don't, just don't #

01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:07.208
You got this Cody.
Come on, boy. Come on.

01:24:07.358 --> 01:24:09.642
Yeah, that's
my boy.

01:24:09.792 --> 01:24:10.800
Okay, I gotta go
to work now.

01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:11.958
See you on
Tuesday, okay?

01:24:12.108 --> 01:24:13.125
Okay, Uncle
Charlie.

01:24:13.833 --> 01:24:14.833
Good job, buddy.

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.875
Alright, I'll see
you on Tuesday.

01:24:21.025 --> 01:24:23.725
Okay.
Hey, Charlie.

01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:25.892
It's okay to be
happy, you know.

01:24:26.042 --> 01:24:28.042
Your brother would
want you to be happy.

01:24:29.792 --> 01:24:31.458
I want you
to be happy.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.083
It's just so hard.

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:45.042
Yes, yes it is.

01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:05.975
Morning, Charlie.

01:25:06.125 --> 01:25:07.625
What do you got
for me today?

01:25:07.775 --> 01:25:08.500
The usual.

01:25:09.917 --> 01:25:12.958
Bills. Bills. Bills.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.333
Nothing important.
Thanks, Barney.

01:25:16.483 --> 01:25:17.392
Yep.

01:25:17.542 --> 01:25:19.833
Oh, if you, um, want some
of Mrs. McIntyre's

01:25:19.983 --> 01:25:21.583
cobbler you go
right ahead.

01:25:21.733 --> 01:25:23.183
It's way too
much for me.

01:25:23.333 --> 01:25:25.542
Well, I shouldn't,
but I will.

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:31.250
Hey Charlie, I hope you
don't mind me saying so,

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:36.125
but, um, we all really
miss your brother.

01:25:36.275 --> 01:25:37.708
He was a
good man.

01:25:39.083 --> 01:25:40.333
Thanks Barney.

01:25:43.208 --> 01:25:44.350
You both are.

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:45.892
I'll see you
around, man.

01:25:46.042 --> 01:25:48.917
Yeah. Thanks for
the pie, Charlie.

01:26:09.458 --> 01:26:11.417
Charlie Bishop.

01:26:12.583 --> 01:26:13.975
What's wrong
with her now?

01:26:14.125 --> 01:26:17.167
Nothing. Well, nothing
I can't handle.

01:26:17.317 --> 01:26:19.142
I came to see how
you were doing.

01:26:19.292 --> 01:26:21.500
Thought you might need a
date for the Jamboree tonight.

01:26:21.650 --> 01:26:23.058
Oh, is that tonight?

01:26:23.208 --> 01:26:26.083
Seems like it would be kind
of a waste of a trip for me.

01:26:26.233 --> 01:26:27.958
Yeah, I'm actually
playing it tonight.

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:31.792
I came to
apologize.

01:26:34.792 --> 01:26:35.917
No need to
apologize.

01:26:37.042 --> 01:26:38.717
How was I supposed
to react, Charlie?

01:26:38.867 --> 01:26:40.392
We had a beautiful
night together,

01:26:40.542 --> 01:26:43.208
but the whole world just
doesn't fall into place.

01:26:43.358 --> 01:26:44.475
No.

01:26:44.625 --> 01:26:46.383
But uh, you
could try.

01:26:46.533 --> 01:26:48.142
You can give
it a shot.

01:26:48.292 --> 01:26:49.875
And even if it doesn't
work out, then,

01:26:50.025 --> 01:26:51.333
at least you can
say you tried.

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:55.375
I wish you'd apply
that belief to yourself.

01:26:57.792 --> 01:26:59.250
That belief.

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.333
Maybe in life you don't
get what you want.

01:27:04.483 --> 01:27:05.500
Maybe there's
choices.

01:27:06.417 --> 01:27:08.558
Choosing to
go to school.

01:27:08.708 --> 01:27:09.875
Maybe that leaves
my mom alone.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.083
Maybe that means
I make more money

01:27:12.233 --> 01:27:13.350
so she can have
better meds.

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.750
Maybe that means that I
can take better care of her.

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:16.583
Maybe not.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.667
Maybe she still gets sick,
and maybe she still dies.

01:27:21.817 --> 01:27:23.267
That's a lot
of maybes.

01:27:23.417 --> 01:27:26.042
One thing I do know, is that
the time I spent with her,

01:27:26.192 --> 01:27:27.850
I don't regret.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.208
Not for one
second.

01:27:32.083 --> 01:27:34.625
I chose family.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:36.833
I chose love.

01:27:38.667 --> 01:27:41.750
I left Brad after you came
to visit me that night.

01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:43.183
Good for you.

01:27:43.333 --> 01:27:44.808
I've been doing
my own thing.

01:27:44.958 --> 01:27:47.000
I've been playing in bars
and Mark's been helping me

01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:49.058
with my music
on the side.

01:27:49.208 --> 01:27:51.292
And I have you
to thank for that.

01:27:51.442 --> 01:27:52.667
I saw the flyers.

01:27:54.208 --> 01:27:56.750
I'm happy for you,
I really am.

01:27:58.125 --> 01:28:00.125
I just don't understand
why you came here, Nancy.

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:01.458
I'm sorry.

01:28:02.958 --> 01:28:05.167
I finished that song I
sang for you that night.

01:28:09.333 --> 01:28:13.667
# All of the nights I
stood in that window #

01:28:13.817 --> 01:28:16.558
# Waiting for you
to come home #

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:20.583
# Wondering why you
felt like you had to go #

01:28:20.733 --> 01:28:24.725
# If I'd only known #

01:28:24.875 --> 01:28:28.250
# The things you said
shouldn't, couldn't, wouldn't #

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:34.058
# Ever come true,
came true #

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:36.558
# Here I am standing
in front of you #

01:28:36.708 --> 01:28:41.583
# Don't know what to do,
don't wanna throw us away #

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:45.000
# Here I am believin'
lookin for a reason #

01:28:45.150 --> 01:28:48.000
# And running out of
things to say #

01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:51.000
# So much time and
now I'm findin #

01:28:51.150 --> 01:28:56.541
# I was wrong
all along #

01:28:56.691 --> 01:29:02.083
# So now here
I am gone #

01:29:04.125 --> 01:29:06.767
Damn it, Nancy, why'd
you come back?

01:29:06.917 --> 01:29:09.975
I came back, Charlie,
because you were right.

01:29:10.125 --> 01:29:13.042
The connection we have is
something I can't even explain.

01:29:13.192 --> 01:29:15.771
And that night in the
barn when I told you

01:29:15.921 --> 01:29:18.500
I'd never lost anyone,
you said I was lucky.

01:29:18.650 --> 01:29:19.892
I get that.

01:29:20.042 --> 01:29:21.308
But the difference
here is,

01:29:21.458 --> 01:29:23.292
is I still have a chance to
make it right with you...

01:29:23.442 --> 01:29:24.975
Everything's changed.

01:29:25.125 --> 01:29:27.083
What, how?
- It just has.

01:29:27.233 --> 01:29:28.708
Charlie.

01:29:30.667 --> 01:29:33.946
# I did my best tryin'
to save this #

01:29:34.096 --> 01:29:37.225
# but it wasn't my
choice to make #

01:29:37.375 --> 01:29:41.667
# I was the one, who was
willing to face it #

01:29:41.817 --> 01:29:44.975
# Now I've had
all I can take #

01:29:45.125 --> 01:29:48.000
# All of my crying,
trying, dyin... #

01:29:48.150 --> 01:29:49.542
My brother's dead!

01:29:51.083 --> 01:29:52.625
Okay?!

01:29:54.792 --> 01:29:56.875
He's dead.

01:30:12.417 --> 01:30:14.708
I know Charlie.

01:30:14.858 --> 01:30:16.683
We all do.

01:30:16.833 --> 01:30:18.591
We know how much
he meant to you.

01:30:18.741 --> 01:30:20.500
How much he meant
to all of us.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:23.333
Come to the
Jamboree tonight.

01:30:23.483 --> 01:30:24.875
We want
you there.

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.308
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:30:28.458 --> 01:30:30.875
Look, there's Barney,
and Megan and Chip.

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:33.058
And Mrs. McIntyre.

01:30:33.208 --> 01:30:37.708
We are all hurting with you,
Charlie. You're not alone.

01:30:37.858 --> 01:30:40.500
You said it to me
when I was afraid.

01:30:42.792 --> 01:30:45.333
We're all
family here.

01:30:45.483 --> 01:30:47.708
Rain or shine.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:54.792
# I won't be past the
point of hurtin' #

01:30:54.942 --> 01:31:01.021
# Or thinkin' that
it's worth it #

01:31:01.171 --> 01:31:07.250
# I can't let go,
of holding on #

01:31:08.542 --> 01:31:11.083
# Here I am standing
in front of you #

01:31:11.233 --> 01:31:13.708
# Don't know
what to do #

01:31:13.858 --> 01:31:16.183
# Don't wanna
throw us away #

01:31:16.333 --> 01:31:19.417
# Here I am believin',
lookin' for a reason #

01:31:19.567 --> 01:31:22.729
# But running out of
things to say #

01:31:22.879 --> 01:31:26.042
# So much time and
now I'm findin #

01:31:26.192 --> 01:31:33.167
# I was wrong
all along #

01:31:33.317 --> 01:31:39.312
# Baby, I
was wrong #

01:31:39.462 --> 01:31:45.458
# So now
here I am #

01:31:50.875 --> 01:31:53.042
Hi.

01:31:54.292 --> 01:31:55.708
It's good to
see you.

01:31:55.858 --> 01:31:57.375
You, too.

01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:59.612
I'm Charlie.

01:31:59.762 --> 01:32:00.975
I'm Nancy.

01:32:01.125 --> 01:32:02.667
It's a pleasure
to meet...
