Guess who has a date
with Bonnie Kleinschmidt?

02:03.724 --> 02:05.425
Pat Sajak.

02:07.493 --> 02:09.195
Close.

02:09.229 --> 02:12.398
Me. Larry Appleton. Stud.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.436
I have a date with
Bonnie Kleinschmidt.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.872
Fourth runner‐up in
the Miss Chicago Beauty Contest.

02:18.905 --> 02:19.906
Oof.

02:19.940 --> 02:20.841
But I thought she always

02:20.874 --> 02:22.809
laugh in your face
when you ask her out.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.913
She's beautiful
when she laughs.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.583
But she won't be laughing
in this face anymore.

02:29.616 --> 02:32.753
I have two tickets to
the Bruce Springsteen Concert.

02:32.786 --> 02:33.587
Wow.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.257
So that's how
you get dates.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.525
You bribe them.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.394
It's a method.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.897
When I walk
into that stadium

02:43.930 --> 02:45.699
Bruce is gonna look down
and see Bonnie on my arm

02:45.732 --> 02:48.535
and say, "Whoa,
way to go, Appleton."

02:51.505 --> 02:52.973
I'm happy for you.
Now let's go.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.775
‐ Where?
‐ Where.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.276
We‐we've got to
go to the hospital

02:56.309 --> 02:57.410
to visit Mr. Twinkacetti.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.580
He broke his leg. Remember?

02:59.613 --> 03:02.616
Ye‐e‐eah, I remember,
but I'm not going.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.554
But...you promised.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.956
Does this mean we're not
going out for ice cream either?

03:11.958 --> 03:13.860
Balki, I agreed to
our little field trip

03:13.894 --> 03:16.262
before I had
a date with Bonnie.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.665
I don't wanna risk missing
that date by getting sick.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.601
Hospitals are
crawling with germs.

03:22.302 --> 03:23.670
What germs is?

03:25.506 --> 03:28.809
Germs are little tiny,
living organisms

03:28.842 --> 03:32.846
that cause sickness,
disease and death.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.648
They're all over,
every place.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.727
Are there any here now?

03:47.928 --> 03:50.430
You betcha. They're
all over the place.

03:50.463 --> 03:53.399
On this table, on that
couch, all over this can.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.812
I don't see anything.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.516
Nobody can see them.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.418
They are, they're‐they're
tiny, they're microscopic.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.322
See, germs are
little tiny things

04:16.356 --> 04:18.024
that travel through the air

04:18.058 --> 04:20.961
and they get into your body,
and they make you sick.

04:24.497 --> 04:27.634
Tell me about these
little invisible creatures.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.670
Do they have a leader?

04:31.404 --> 04:33.339
Okay, Balki.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.475
You may not believe it,
but germs are real.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.510
I should know.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.344
Every time there was
something really important

04:38.378 --> 04:40.681
in my life, germs
ruined it for me.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.716
I missed my
sixth‐grade graduation.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.518
I missed the spelling bee,
and I was a shoo‐in.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.389
I missed my junior prom
all because of germs.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.725
And I am not going to
miss Bonnie Kleinschmidt.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.396
Okay, I'll go to the hospital.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.965
You stay here.
I'll go visit our boss.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.067
And when he says,
"Where's Appleton?"

05:01.101 --> 05:02.903
I'll say, "Oh, him?

05:02.936 --> 05:06.406
"He's at home hiding from
little invisible things

05:06.439 --> 05:07.974
that are out to get him."

05:12.445 --> 05:14.881
Okay, five minutes. No more.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.417
Don't worry, I'll
watch out for germs.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.654
[swats]

05:22.422 --> 05:23.990
Got him.

[instrumental music]

05:29.830 --> 05:32.633
Boy, American
hospitals are wonderful.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.501
Do they keep the animals
on another floor?

05:35.769 --> 05:36.737
Yes.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.373
Now, can we just say, "Get well"

05:40.406 --> 05:43.544
and get out of here? This
place is crawling with germs.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.512
A Mypos army helmet.

05:49.415 --> 05:50.350
'Balki.'

05:54.087 --> 05:55.822
Balki, take that off.
It is not a helmet.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.127
‐ What is it?
‐ It's, oh...it's not a helmet.

06:04.731 --> 06:08.101
Okay, now we
have three minutes.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.604
(woman on PA)
'Telephone, please, Dr. Klein.'

06:10.637 --> 06:13.473
Hello, Mr. Twinkacetti.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.141
Don't tell me, you're
here for your lobotomy.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.880
No, we didn't come for fun.
We came to visit you.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.849
Hello, Mr. Twinkacetti.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.985
I'm‐I'm sorry
about your leg.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.887
‐ See you later.
‐ Thanks.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.023
Whoa. Before you go,
uh, here, lower my leg.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.993
Use the crank, and you
hold my foot gently.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.127
It hurts.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.864
‐ Gently.
‐ Uh..

06:37.898 --> 06:39.499
‐ Stuck.
‐ Stuck?

06:39.533 --> 06:41.101
Well, yeah, just
press the release.

came to visit.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.152

the way down the hall.

children, Donnie and Marie.

mouth when you sneeze.

everybody your germs.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.612

and it is all your fault.

08:16.262 --> 08:18.231
‐ It is?
‐ Yes.

Huh!

brat sneezed on me

‐ Doobed.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.135
Oh, uh, no, no, well,

09:08.314 --> 09:10.050
Okay, bye‐bye.

09:11.818 --> 09:14.054
Alright, I can do this.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.657
I need vitamins,
I need liquids.

'Thank you.'

09:43.984 --> 09:45.819
You sound terrible.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.754
Of course,
I sound terrible.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.790
There's a war
going on in there.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.662
Who's winning?

10:01.067 --> 10:02.769
I'm going to win this one.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.038
Germs made me
miss my junior prom.

10:05.071 --> 10:08.975
But I am not going to
miss Bonnie Kleinschmidt.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.044
Why don't you cancel
this date and ask her out

10:11.077 --> 10:13.379
again sometime when
you can feel better?

10:13.413 --> 10:16.282
Oh, sure, just ask her
out some other time.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.818
Why don't I wait
for Halley's Comet

10:17.851 --> 10:19.786
to fly through
my living room?

10:21.021 --> 10:23.824
Well, I had an uncle
who was hit by a meteor.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.694
I bet you did.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.898
I am not giving
up this time.

10:31.932 --> 10:36.169
I got my A, I got my B,
I got my C, I got my D.

10:36.202 --> 10:39.339
Yeah, put them all together
and what do they spell?

10:39.372 --> 10:40.340
Abcd.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.782
You can take those little pills.
They probably won't hurt you.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.384
But if you really want to get
well, you've got to get serious.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.654
Now, I've got your garlic.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.923
I've got your wolfbane.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.360
And I've got
your pumpkin mold.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.365
What is that?

11:05.398 --> 11:07.167
Well, you take a pumpkin
and you put it out

11:07.200 --> 11:08.835
in the backyard
until it rots.

11:08.869 --> 11:12.038
And then this fuzzy
blue stuff comes‐‐

11:12.072 --> 11:14.941
I know what mold is.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.712
Why did you buy it?

11:18.745 --> 11:21.047
Well, I'm the one that
made you go to the hospital.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.116
So the least I can do is
make you better for your date.

11:23.149 --> 11:26.753
Now, the wolfbane
is for your runny nose.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.955
The pumpkin mold
is for your cough.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.324
And the garlic just makes
you feel good all over.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.795
And I bet it
keeps away vampires.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.296
Well, that's
a side benefit.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.365
Balki, why don't you
go into the kitchen

11:39.399 --> 11:41.802
and try to turn
some lead into gold?

11:42.869 --> 11:44.905
Leave me alone.

11:47.273 --> 11:51.044
A, A, A, A.

11:53.446 --> 11:57.150
B, B, B, B.

11:58.852 --> 12:02.488
Cousin, I really
can make you better.

12:02.523 --> 12:03.957
How?

12:03.990 --> 12:05.158
By feeding me things
that pigs would

12:05.191 --> 12:07.894
turn up their snouts at?

12:07.928 --> 12:10.363
No, those things are only
to make you feel better

12:10.396 --> 12:13.066
while I cook you
this secret Mypos cure.

12:13.099 --> 12:15.468
It's the only thing
that will make you well.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.139
A cure?

12:19.172 --> 12:22.943
Balki, I have a cold.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.478
All of medical science has
been trying for centuries

12:25.512 --> 12:29.816
to find a cure for the common
cold, and have failed.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.417
Now you're telling me that Mypos

12:31.451 --> 12:33.253
a country with one phone..

12:35.321 --> 12:37.390
...a country where
only the royal family

12:37.423 --> 12:39.926
has indoor plumbing..

12:39.960 --> 12:41.294
...a country where the foremost

12:41.327 --> 12:44.130
spectator sport is
spitting for distance..

12:45.431 --> 12:48.368
...tiny little
Mypos has the cure?

12:49.202 --> 12:51.471
Yes.

12:51.505 --> 12:53.907
I'll stick with modern
medicine, thank you.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.916
[choking]

13:05.085 --> 13:07.821
[coughing]

13:11.124 --> 13:13.860
[instrumental music]

13:17.030 --> 13:18.064
[Larry sneezes]

13:21.535 --> 13:24.004
[Larry grunting]

13:27.574 --> 13:29.409
Not working, is it?

13:29.442 --> 13:32.112
It's working just fine.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.215
I can't breath, but my
skin is soft and supple.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.623
You've wasted almost the whole
day with this hocus pocus.

13:42.656 --> 13:46.059
Are you ready to try
the garlic necklace now?

13:46.092 --> 13:49.563
Balki, get that away from me.
It smells terrible.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.331
You see? It's working already.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.871
[Larry breathing heavily]

14:08.014 --> 14:10.316
Don't you have
something else to do?

14:13.119 --> 14:15.155
Well, excuse me
for being well.

14:17.558 --> 14:20.393
I'm sorry.
I'm on edge.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.195
I have an hour
and a half to get well

14:22.228 --> 14:24.631
or I'm gonna miss
the date of my life.

14:24.665 --> 14:26.232
Oh, who am I kidding?

14:27.433 --> 14:29.235
I'm not gonna make it.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.108
Maybe you'd feel better
if you got dressed.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.643
Maybe I will.

14:39.580 --> 14:40.947
My mother used
to say that.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.116
She'd say, "Larry, if you get up

14:43.149 --> 14:44.585
"and get dressed,
and go to school

14:44.618 --> 14:45.919
you'll feel better."

14:46.587 --> 14:48.054
[breathing heavily]

14:49.455 --> 14:50.957
She lied.

14:52.392 --> 14:56.329
I always got up, I got
dressed, I went to school.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.064
I never felt better.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.301
The germs have won again.

15:02.536 --> 15:05.271
No prom for Larry Appleton.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.281
Is that it?

15:15.315 --> 15:17.250
Are you giving up
just like that?

15:17.718 --> 15:20.053
Yes.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.421
Call Bonnie Kleinschmidt.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.524
Tell her I died in my sleep.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.660
Oh, and tell her I was rich.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.829
Why should she be happy?

15:32.699 --> 15:35.301
You get up.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.370
You don't give up like that.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.242
Balki, it's over.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.477
I've tried everything.

15:44.511 --> 15:47.313
You've tried everything?

15:47.347 --> 15:49.716
I've tried everything.

15:49.750 --> 15:52.318
I make the secret
Mypos cure for you.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.021
It's finished, it's sitting
right there in the kitchen

15:55.055 --> 15:57.490
in case anybody should want it.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.762
Balki, don't
you understand?

16:01.795 --> 16:04.430
I have to pick Bonnie up
in an hour and a half.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.499
It works in 20 minutes.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.201
But, Balki,
that makes no sense.

16:08.234 --> 16:11.104
It goes against 200
years of medical science.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.174
Well, then, I'll just
flush it down the toilet.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.512
Alright, alright.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.247
I‐I‐I've tried
everything else.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.683
Why not?

16:22.716 --> 16:24.685
Give me the Mypos cure.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.090
What was that?

16:34.795 --> 16:38.164
Give me the Mypos cure.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.768
Give you the Mypos cure?

16:41.802 --> 16:46.239
You, who make fun of my
country's medicine all day long?

16:46.272 --> 16:48.174
You, who thinks
little tiny people

16:48.208 --> 16:50.110
are fighting up your nose?

16:52.145 --> 16:55.248
Give you the Mypos cure?

16:55.281 --> 16:58.018
You're gonna make this
hard for me, aren't you?

16:59.319 --> 17:02.155
Well, of course, I'm not.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.191
All I want you to do
is say the magic words.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.628
What? Please.

17:08.662 --> 17:11.263
Thank you. I'm sorry.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.065
[shouts]
What?

17:17.838 --> 17:18.805
What?

17:20.707 --> 17:24.377
I want you to say,
"I believe."

17:24.410 --> 17:25.712
‐ "I believe."
‐ Like you mean it.

17:25.746 --> 17:27.146
Oh‐h‐h.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.087
"I believe."

17:35.355 --> 17:37.190
I knew you would.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.563
It's okay. When I'm well,
I'll renounce everything.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.401
‐ I heard that.
‐ Oh..

17:51.371 --> 17:54.675
Now, first, let me warn
you, it tastes terrible.

17:54.708 --> 17:58.244
It doesn't matter.
I can't taste anything anyway.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.346
‐ And it looks terrible.
‐ Oh, my Lord.

18:02.816 --> 18:04.685
‐ What‐what's in that?
‐ It's a secret.

18:04.718 --> 18:06.452
I can imagine.

18:06.486 --> 18:10.356
I mean, is there eye of newt
or bat's wings in there?

18:10.390 --> 18:13.594
Well, of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.

18:13.627 --> 18:15.395
That's for back pain.

18:17.831 --> 18:20.266
This is fish parts and herbs.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.302
Oh, I, I'll be right back.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.586
What did you do?

18:41.221 --> 18:43.824
I drank it. You're
right, it's disgusting.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.361
That was enough
for a whole village.

18:48.895 --> 18:49.896
This..

18:51.331 --> 18:52.332
'This..'

19:03.309 --> 19:06.513
This..

19:06.547 --> 19:08.915
...was how much you
were supposed to take.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.554
So? It's just
herbs and fish parts.

19:14.788 --> 19:16.590
A little is good,
a lot is better.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.224
[sighs]

19:18.258 --> 19:20.493
[mumbling]

19:20.527 --> 19:22.596
Well, how long
does it take to work?

19:23.897 --> 19:25.799
Well, that amount
should work pretty fast.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.202
Well, I'm waiting.
I don't feel anything.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.377
Balki..

19:39.846 --> 19:42.849
...I can see...through you.

19:52.993 --> 19:55.929
[instrumental music]

20:12.012 --> 20:14.748
[instrumental music]

20:18.519 --> 20:21.254
[Larry groaning]

20:22.388 --> 20:22.956
Cousin.

20:24.525 --> 20:25.759
Are you waking up?

20:25.792 --> 20:27.728
Who‐o‐oa.

20:28.829 --> 20:31.632
Wh‐h‐hoa.

20:31.665 --> 20:34.635
That was some
potent stuff.

20:36.937 --> 20:39.405
I bet you're feeling
like a million digdas.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.374
I feel fantastic!

20:41.407 --> 20:42.609
[inhales deeply]

20:42.643 --> 20:44.477
I can breath.

20:44.511 --> 20:49.516
I feel better than I have
felt...in my entire life.

20:49.550 --> 20:52.452
Balki, that is
a miracle cure.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.887
Well, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.488
There's something
we've got to talk about.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.724
I have 15 minutes to
get ready for my date.

20:57.758 --> 20:59.793
Balki, how can
I ever thank you?

20:59.826 --> 21:00.827
‐ Well, before you‐‐
‐ Balki.

21:00.861 --> 21:02.663
You should
bottle that stuff.

21:03.764 --> 21:05.431
Do you realize
what you have there?

21:05.465 --> 21:07.300
An herbal medicine
that can cure

21:07.333 --> 21:08.635
a person in
less than an hour.

21:08.669 --> 21:10.436
Why is the evening
paper so thick?

21:12.539 --> 21:14.675
Well, because it's
Sunday's paper.

21:14.708 --> 21:17.911
Sunday? I have been
asleep for 24 hours?

21:18.912 --> 21:20.681
‐ Well, no.
‐ Oh.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.049
Actually, it's Tuesday.

21:23.083 --> 21:24.818
I thought you might
like the Sunday funnies.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.860
I have been asleep
for three days?

21:34.961 --> 21:36.897
Three days?

21:38.565 --> 21:40.934
What happened to "Thank you,
Balki, for the miracle?"

21:43.837 --> 21:45.772
Three days!

21:45.806 --> 21:48.041
Well, if you had taken
just a teaspoonful

21:48.074 --> 21:49.810
like you were supposed to,
you would have taken

21:49.843 --> 21:51.812
just a nice little
20‐minute nap.

21:51.845 --> 21:54.047
But you had to gobble
down the whole thing.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.350
So you took 216
little 20‐minute naps.

21:57.383 --> 21:58.619
I counted.

22:00.486 --> 22:04.090
I missed my one‐shot date
with Bonnie Kleinschmidt.

22:04.124 --> 22:06.026
Well, we gotta
talk about that too.

22:16.537 --> 22:19.706
After you were asleep, Bonnie
called and she was very excited

22:19.740 --> 22:21.441
about seeing Bruce Springsteen.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.810
So I did just what
you told me to do.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.746
I told her you were dead.

22:27.047 --> 22:28.915
And then I told
her you were rich.

22:30.617 --> 22:33.620
And then I...
took her out myself.

22:35.889 --> 22:38.058
You took out my date?

22:38.091 --> 22:40.360
Well, of course,
I did. You were dead.

22:43.764 --> 22:45.566
But you didn't
miss anything.

22:45.599 --> 22:47.433
When we got there,
Bonnie ran off

22:47.467 --> 22:50.470
with some guy who
had front‐row tickets.

22:50.504 --> 22:52.939
You slept through that
humiliating experience.

22:54.474 --> 22:55.876
I lived it.

23:05.085 --> 23:08.689
Well, I'm‐I'm sorry that
you had to go through that.

23:10.724 --> 23:14.027
I...guess I've
been a little rude.

23:14.995 --> 23:17.030
Insensitive.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.432
Inconsiderate.

23:19.465 --> 23:22.669
‐ Stop me anytime now.
‐ No, you're doing fine.

23:22.703 --> 23:24.838
Well, I realize you had
my best interests at heart.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.106
I did.

23:26.139 --> 23:27.774
And I know I
should not have

23:27.808 --> 23:29.676
forced the Mypos
cure on you

23:29.710 --> 23:31.978
even though it was
the best thing for you.

23:32.012 --> 23:33.514
Well, let's not
fight about it.

23:33.547 --> 23:36.182
I mean, you have your
ways and I have my ways.

23:36.216 --> 23:37.784
Exactly.

23:37.818 --> 23:39.886
Who's to say who's right?

23:39.920 --> 23:42.756
You say tomato
and I say tomato.

23:45.959 --> 23:48.094
Good point.

23:48.128 --> 23:49.730
At least it
wasn't a total loss.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.031
You got to see
Bruce Springsteen.

23:51.064 --> 23:52.999
Oh, he didn't show up.

23:53.033 --> 23:55.869
He had the flu and was
smart enough to stay home.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.171
They rescheduled
the concert for next week.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.040
You can go then with
Bonnie Kleinschmidt.

24:02.909 --> 24:06.580
No, I don't think so.

24:06.613 --> 24:10.216
I think I'll give this ticket
to somebody who deserves it.

24:10.250 --> 24:13.053
Somebody who
knows Larry Appleton.

24:13.086 --> 24:15.121
Someone who likes
Larry Appleton.

24:15.155 --> 24:17.691
Someone who's related
to Larry Appleton.

24:18.925 --> 24:19.893
Why not?

24:19.926 --> 24:20.894
You spent the last three days

24:20.927 --> 24:21.895
taking care of me, didn't you?

24:21.928 --> 24:23.930
I dusted you every morning.

24:26.667 --> 24:28.735
What do you say you
and I use these tickets?

24:29.570 --> 24:30.604
