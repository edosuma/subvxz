<i>We begin this episode</i>

01:12.138 --> 01:13.639
<i>shortly after Burt has found out</i>

01:13.640 --> 01:15.642
<i>he's going to die.</i>

01:24.150 --> 01:25.651
Burt.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.656
Hey, Mare.

01:30.657 --> 01:31.657
He told you.

01:31.658 --> 01:32.658
The doctor told you?

01:32.659 --> 01:35.661
I wanted to tell you myself.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.663
You know?

01:37.664 --> 01:39.164
He called me
just a little while ago

01:39.165 --> 01:40.165
and told me.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.668
Isn't it wonderful?

01:46.673 --> 01:47.673
Wonderful?

01:47.674 --> 01:49.174
This is... This...
This is wonderful?

01:49.175 --> 01:50.676
You don't want the baby?

01:50.677 --> 01:52.177
Ah! No, the baby.

01:52.178 --> 01:53.679
Oh, Mare, I love the baby.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.680
I love it.

01:54.681 --> 01:56.682
I want your baby.
I love that baby.

01:56.683 --> 01:57.683
It's so great.

01:57.684 --> 01:58.684
Baby. I know.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.185
But he didn't tell you
anything else?

02:00.186 --> 02:01.186
What else is there?

02:01.187 --> 02:02.187
Oh, who knows?
I don't know.

02:02.188 --> 02:03.188
Maybe he told you.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.190
I got so crazy happy
when I found out.

02:05.191 --> 02:06.692
Oh, Burt, I'm so relieved
that you're happy.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.693
I didn't know
how you'd take the news.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.195
I mean, this isn't anything
we've ever discussed.

02:10.196 --> 02:13.198
This is not the best time
for us to be having a baby.

02:13.199 --> 02:16.201
You're telling me.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.704
It'll be wonderful, Burt.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.706
It will.

02:20.707 --> 02:23.709
A baby.

02:23.710 --> 02:26.211
With a baby, we'll stay young.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.713
Forget "young".

02:27.714 --> 02:30.215
I'll settle for "stay".

02:30.216 --> 02:32.718
Our first baby together.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.223
What is it?

02:38.224 --> 02:40.225
What?

02:40.226 --> 02:43.228
You're staring.

02:43.229 --> 02:44.730
Your face.

02:44.731 --> 02:48.233
I was looking at that face.

02:48.234 --> 02:51.236
I love it, Mare.

02:51.237 --> 02:54.740
You've got a great face, toots.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.743
I don't ever want
to stop seeing you.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.245
Are you crying?

03:00.246 --> 03:01.246
What? No. Yes.
Could be!

03:01.247 --> 03:04.249
Who knows? Joy.
Tears of joy here.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.250
Go pack a bag.
Pack?

03:05.251 --> 03:07.252
Come on, Mare, pack.
We're going to go.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.254
We're going to travel.
We're going to see the world.

03:09.255 --> 03:10.255
We'll go to Africa, Mare.
Come on.

03:10.256 --> 03:12.257
Let's go to Africa
before it's too late.

03:12.258 --> 03:13.759
Too late for what?

03:15.762 --> 03:17.262
For the... For the rhinos, Mare.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.764
The rhinos are dying.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.267
The rhinos and all the elephants
are dying,

03:22.268 --> 03:23.769
not to mention others,

03:23.770 --> 03:25.771
so let's get there
before they're all dead.

03:25.772 --> 03:26.772
Mare, please,
let's get to Africa

03:26.773 --> 03:28.775
before Colonel Sanders does.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.778
Burt, this is perhaps
not the best time

03:32.779 --> 03:34.780
for me to go to Africa,
you know?

03:34.781 --> 03:36.782
Being pregnant and all.

03:36.783 --> 03:37.783
I know!
Yes, you're pregnant!

03:37.784 --> 03:38.784
No, don't do this.
Come over...

03:38.785 --> 03:39.785
You don't go to Af...

03:39.786 --> 03:41.286
The elephants...
Sit down, there.

03:41.287 --> 03:42.788
Easy. That's it.
You sit down.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.289
Mary, you should stay home.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.291
Burt, I'd like to stay home.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.793
I'm going to stay home
with you too, Mare.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.295
For the next five...
God willing, six... months,

03:50.296 --> 03:51.797
I'm not going to work.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.298
Burt, you can't leave work.

03:53.299 --> 03:54.800
I don't have to go there.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.802
Danny can run everything.
I'm going to stay home with you.

03:56.803 --> 03:58.303
And smoke.
You got a cigarette?

03:58.304 --> 03:59.805
Burt, you don't smoke.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.307
It's time to start.
I'm going to learn how.

04:02.308 --> 04:04.810
What in the world
do you want to smoke for?

04:04.811 --> 04:06.311
Because you're having
a baby, Mare.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.312
That's traditional.

04:07.313 --> 04:08.814
You... You...
You pass out cigarettes.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.315
Cigars.

04:10.316 --> 04:11.817
Cigars! Who cares?

04:11.818 --> 04:12.818
I'll smoke anything.

04:12.819 --> 04:15.821
I want to smoke and drink
and eat fatty foods.

04:15.822 --> 04:16.822
Come on, Mare.

04:16.822 --> 04:19.825
Let's go get us
a fatty pastrami.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.827
Burt, I'm the one

04:21.827 --> 04:23.829
that should want
the funny foods.

04:23.830 --> 04:24.830
I'm the pregnant one.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.832
Ah, that's right.
That's true.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.333
This is... All right.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.835
Go put on your best dress.

04:29.836 --> 04:30.836
We're going to go out,

04:30.837 --> 04:31.837
and we're going to celebrate.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.338
Where?

04:33.339 --> 04:34.840
What kind of funny food
you want?

04:34.841 --> 04:36.341
French.

04:36.342 --> 04:37.342
Good. Go get dressed.

04:37.343 --> 04:38.343
We're going to Paris.

04:38.344 --> 04:39.845
Come on! Mary, go! Go!

04:39.846 --> 04:42.348
Not so fast.
Easy. Walking.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.353
Phew.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.859
Oh.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.865
When they said, "You giveth
and you taketh away,"

04:59.866 --> 05:03.368
they knew
what they were talking about.

05:03.369 --> 05:06.371
But all in one day?

05:06.372 --> 05:09.875
Ah, I'm sure
you've got your reasons.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.878
I got a request, though.

05:12.879 --> 05:15.881
Take care of them.

05:15.882 --> 05:17.883
You take good care of them.

05:17.884 --> 05:19.885
You, uh... do that.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.887
Just do that one thing.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.389
And if you get
a little time on your hands,

05:24.390 --> 05:25.891
you got nothing to do,

05:25.892 --> 05:27.392
don't wait for a telethon,
would you?

05:27.393 --> 05:29.395
Just find a cure.

05:40.406 --> 05:42.407
Oh, hurry. Hurry.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.910
Oh, look at us.
We're soaked.

05:44.911 --> 05:45.911
Oh...

05:45.912 --> 05:47.412
I don't believe it.

05:47.413 --> 05:48.413
Well, so much for the zoo.

05:48.414 --> 05:49.915
Those poor animals,
having to stand

05:49.916 --> 05:52.417
out in weather like this.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.919
I never realized how rotten

05:53.920 --> 05:56.922
an elephant could smell
when he's wet.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.424
I love you.

05:59.926 --> 06:01.426
Uh, sorry.

06:01.427 --> 06:02.928
It, uh, just slipped out.

06:02.929 --> 06:03.929
It's the rain.

06:03.930 --> 06:04.930
Rain.

06:04.931 --> 06:05.931
Do you think

06:05.932 --> 06:06.932
it's going to rain tomorrow?

06:06.933 --> 06:08.433
I heard that if the sky is red,

06:08.434 --> 06:09.935
it usually means that...

06:13.940 --> 06:14.940
Means that the rain...

06:14.941 --> 06:16.441
Did you just kiss me like that

06:16.442 --> 06:17.943
because you love me too,
or what?

06:17.944 --> 06:19.444
I love you

06:19.445 --> 06:20.946
and I never want to let you go.

06:29.956 --> 06:31.957
I guess this means
that we'll be seeing

06:31.958 --> 06:33.458
a lot more of each other, huh?

06:34.961 --> 06:36.963
Oh, Danny.

06:41.968 --> 06:42.968
They're staring.

06:42.969 --> 06:43.969
Who?

06:43.970 --> 06:44.970
Everybody. Look.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.472
They're blatantly staring at us.

06:47.473 --> 06:48.974
Well, we're kissing.

06:48.975 --> 06:49.975
No, no. No, no.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.476
That's not why they're staring.

06:51.477 --> 06:54.480
They're staring because
we're a bisexual couple.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.487
We are?

07:02.488 --> 07:04.990
Yeah, you're black
and I'm white,

07:04.991 --> 07:06.992
and they're staring.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.994
We're also dripping wet
and hugging.

07:08.995 --> 07:10.495
I'd stare at that.

07:10.496 --> 07:11.997
Well, I tell you,

07:11.998 --> 07:15.500
some people just have
nothing better to do.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.002
Danny, it's so cold.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.503
Oh, here, here, wrap up in this.

07:18.504 --> 07:20.005
Oh, thank you.

07:20.006 --> 07:23.508
Listen, as long as we're here,
why don't we dry off?

07:23.509 --> 07:24.509
How?

07:24.510 --> 07:26.011
There's no sun out there.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.012
It's raining.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.513
Dryers.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.015
Oh, yeah.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.516
Good idea.

07:36.522 --> 07:39.024
Hey, how are we
going to do this?

07:39.025 --> 07:41.526
You take off your shirt,

07:41.527 --> 07:42.527
give me the jacket,

07:42.528 --> 07:44.529
I'll take off my shirt,

07:44.530 --> 07:46.531
put on the jacket
till the shirt is dry.

07:46.532 --> 07:47.532
Okay.
Uh...

07:47.533 --> 07:48.533
Here.

07:48.534 --> 07:50.535
Wait a minute.
Uh...

07:50.536 --> 07:52.037
I got it. I got. I got it.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.040
Ah, good. Good.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.041
Yeah.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.042
And then, uh...

07:57.043 --> 07:58.543
And then I'll take off my pants,

07:58.544 --> 08:00.045
and you can
give me back the jacket,

08:00.046 --> 08:01.546
and I'll tie the jacket
around my waist

08:01.547 --> 08:03.048
until my pants are dry,

08:03.049 --> 08:04.549
and then you can wear my pants

08:04.550 --> 08:06.551
while your pants are drying.

08:06.552 --> 08:11.056
How about you dry your shirt,
I wear it till mine dries,

08:11.057 --> 08:14.059
then when mine dries,
I give yours back to you,

08:14.060 --> 08:16.561
and you wear yours
and I wear mine?

08:16.562 --> 08:18.563
Do I have to wear your pants?

08:18.564 --> 08:20.565
Well, not unless you want to.

08:20.566 --> 08:24.069
Good, because I don't do that.

08:24.070 --> 08:27.072
Okay.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.573
How about
we hop in the dryer ourselves

08:28.574 --> 08:30.075
and save time?

08:30.076 --> 08:31.076
Are you kidding?

08:31.077 --> 08:32.577
You get hit with a hot zipper,

08:32.578 --> 08:33.578
it's all over.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.582
Hey, are you hungry?

08:37.582 --> 08:39.083
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.085
How about you?

08:40.086 --> 08:41.086
Yeah. What we got?

08:41.087 --> 08:43.587
Let's see. We got...

08:47.093 --> 08:50.595
We got wet egg salad
and wet ham and cheese.

08:50.596 --> 08:51.596
Yuck.

08:51.597 --> 08:53.598
Anything dry?

08:53.599 --> 08:55.601
Just the coffee.

08:59.605 --> 09:00.605
What's the matter?

09:00.606 --> 09:03.608
Their staring at us again.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.610
Danny, I don't wonder.

09:05.611 --> 09:06.611
I mean, look at us.

09:06.612 --> 09:07.612
I'm telling you,

09:07.613 --> 09:12.117
some people just have
nothing better to do.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.118
Danny...

09:13.119 --> 09:14.119
Well, it's not right.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.120
Danny...

09:15.121 --> 09:17.122
right or wrong,
people are going to stare.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.623
I mean, we're different,

09:18.624 --> 09:21.126
and they may or may not approve,

09:21.127 --> 09:22.127
but the fact of it is

09:22.128 --> 09:24.629
that we're just going to
have to get used to that.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.131
I know.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.133
You're right.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.136
Hey, let's get out of here.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.138
Well, I don't think
our clothes are dry yet.

09:33.139 --> 09:35.140
Hey, sure they are.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.641
How about that?

09:36.642 --> 09:38.143
Dry as a bone.

09:38.144 --> 09:41.147
Oh, good.

09:42.648 --> 09:43.648
I love you.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.150
I heard.

09:53.659 --> 09:55.160
What are you staring at, clown?

09:55.161 --> 09:56.161
Danny...

09:56.162 --> 09:58.163
No, wait a minute.
What are you staring at?

09:58.164 --> 09:59.664
Because we're different colors?

09:59.665 --> 10:00.665
Because, uh...

10:00.666 --> 10:02.167
Because maybe you don't approve?

10:02.168 --> 10:04.170
Huh? Is that it,
bug eyes?

10:06.172 --> 10:08.673
We happen to be in love.

10:08.674 --> 10:11.676
I'm very happy
for the both of you.

10:11.677 --> 10:12.677
So what's your problem?

10:12.678 --> 10:15.681
You've got on my shirt.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.185
Oh...

10:30.696 --> 10:31.696
Hi.

10:31.697 --> 10:32.697
Hi.

10:32.698 --> 10:33.698
What time is it?

10:33.699 --> 10:35.200
Nine.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.201
Nine? Nine in the morning?

10:36.202 --> 10:38.203
Yes.
Why didn't you wake me?

10:38.204 --> 10:39.204
Because if I woke you,

10:39.205 --> 10:43.208
we wouldn't have gotten
any sleep at all.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.209
Sleep?

10:44.210 --> 10:45.710
Who cares about sleep?

10:45.711 --> 10:48.213
A person spends
a third of his life sleeping.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.714
Why don't we go back to bed?

10:49.715 --> 10:52.217
Let me get a little nourishment
first, okay?

10:52.218 --> 10:53.718
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:53.719 --> 10:54.719
I'm just so excited.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.720
I mean, it's like
discovering America

10:55.721 --> 10:58.223
or a third arm or something.

11:01.727 --> 11:03.228
I know.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.230
This is the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

11:05.231 --> 11:08.733
I should have started this
10 years ago.

11:08.734 --> 11:11.736
I mean, to hell with television.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.238
Why don't we have
some breakfast together.

11:13.239 --> 11:14.739
Who could eat?

11:14.740 --> 11:16.241
I feel like running
up on the roof

11:16.242 --> 11:17.242
and telling
the whole neighborhood

11:17.243 --> 11:18.743
what happened last night.

11:18.744 --> 11:22.247
Well, I'm sure that most of them
already know.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.750
I was a little loud, wasn't I?

11:28.754 --> 11:30.755
I understand how you feel.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.257
Like Christopher Columbus.

11:32.258 --> 11:35.260
But this wears off in time.

11:35.261 --> 11:37.262
I can't imagine why.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.764
You know, Billy,
sex isn't everything.

11:39.765 --> 11:43.268
You're wrong.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.769
No, it isn't.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.771
It didn't keep
my marriage together.

11:46.772 --> 11:49.274
There's got to be
much more than sex.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.276
I know that.
Don't you think I know that?

11:51.277 --> 11:53.278
It just can't be
all that we have.

11:53.279 --> 11:55.280
Look, this could stop tomorrow
and I'd still be with you.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.782
It's just icing on the cake.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.284
Oh, Billy.

12:01.287 --> 12:03.788
Now, how about some breakfast?

12:03.789 --> 12:06.291
We'll eat later.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.308
Oh.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.811
I don't believe this.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.814
Hi.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.316
Hi.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.317
How's my favorite mother?

12:32.318 --> 12:34.319
Fat.
Your favorite mother is fat.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.820
Ma, you're not fat.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.323
It's okay, really.

12:38.324 --> 12:40.325
It's the most wonderful thing
about being pregnant.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.826
You can eat all you want,

12:41.827 --> 12:44.329
because eventually you'll have
no figure to worry about anyhow.

12:45.331 --> 12:46.331
Mallomar?

12:46.332 --> 12:47.332
Uh, no thanks.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.833
You're terrific.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.335
What's that for?

12:50.336 --> 12:51.836
What's that for?

12:51.837 --> 12:53.838
You're going to be a new mother,
and that's wonderful.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.341
Life is wonderful.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.842
Could we talk?

12:57.843 --> 12:58.843
I thought we were.

12:58.844 --> 12:59.844
About me.

12:59.845 --> 13:01.346
Of course.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.347
I'm in love.

13:02.348 --> 13:05.351
I know.

13:08.354 --> 13:09.854
You know?

13:09.855 --> 13:11.856
You think
I don't know my own boy?

13:11.857 --> 13:13.358
You're finally happy again.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.360
I can see it in your eyes.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.362
I'm so happy I can't believe it.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.864
Who is she?
Black.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.866
Black?

13:21.867 --> 13:22.867
Right.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.370
Martha Black
from down the block?

13:25.371 --> 13:26.871
No.

13:26.872 --> 13:28.873
Good, because she's married.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.375
This one's a widow.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.377
Who?
The one I love.

13:32.378 --> 13:35.880
She's a widow, and black.

13:35.881 --> 13:38.383
Black?

13:39.885 --> 13:42.387
You mean in terms of color?

13:42.388 --> 13:44.889
I'm nuts about her.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.891
Oh, boy.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.393
Oh, boy.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.395
Ma...

13:50.396 --> 13:52.897
I don't believe
you feel this way.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.899
Danny, I don't feel that way,

13:54.900 --> 13:56.901
but there are idiots out there
who do feel that way,

13:56.902 --> 13:58.903
and they tend to make life
very hard

13:58.904 --> 14:00.906
for those of you
who feel the way you do.

14:02.908 --> 14:05.410
I'm scared, that's all.

14:05.411 --> 14:06.911
We love each other.

14:06.912 --> 14:09.914
How do her parents
feel about this?

14:10.916 --> 14:13.418
They hate it.

14:13.419 --> 14:14.419
Oh, good.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.921
So far, it's a piece of cake.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.923
Come on, Bob, try it.

14:18.924 --> 14:22.427
No way! No way!

14:24.430 --> 14:26.431
No way.
I'm scared stiff.

14:26.432 --> 14:27.432
No way, no way.

14:27.433 --> 14:28.433
Aah!

14:28.434 --> 14:29.434
Look out, Jodie!

14:29.435 --> 14:32.437
Aah!
Whoa!

14:32.438 --> 14:33.938
Look, if God had wanted me

14:33.939 --> 14:35.440
to have little wheels
on my feet,

14:35.441 --> 14:38.943
I would have been a skateboard.

14:38.944 --> 14:40.445
Bob, it's fun.
Look, let me show...

14:40.446 --> 14:41.946
No, no, no, no, don't show me.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.449
I don't want you to show me.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.451
Bob, there's a lot of girls

14:46.452 --> 14:47.952
at the roller rink.

14:47.953 --> 14:48.953
Well, yeah,

14:48.954 --> 14:50.956
there's a lot of girls
at the beach too.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.462
Uh, Chuck and I thought
we'd go roller-skating.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.464
I see.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.465
You want to come?

15:00.466 --> 15:01.967
Uh...

15:03.469 --> 15:06.471
No, actually.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.974
Uh, Chuck...

15:12.978 --> 15:14.979
Yeah?

15:14.980 --> 15:16.481
How about a whip
with Bob at the end?

15:16.482 --> 15:17.982
Hey, yeah.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.023
Come on, here you go, Bob!

15:21.487 --> 15:22.488
Bob! Bob!

15:31.997 --> 15:32.997
What's the problem?

15:32.998 --> 15:36.000
Well, uh, remember that girl?

15:36.001 --> 15:37.502
The one we were looking for?

15:37.503 --> 15:38.503
Yeah.

15:38.504 --> 15:39.504
Polly.
Yeah.

15:39.505 --> 15:40.505
Black?
Yeah.

15:40.506 --> 15:41.506
You met her
in the...? Yeah.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.507
You're in love
with her? Yeah.

15:42.508 --> 15:43.508
I'm not surprised.

15:43.509 --> 15:45.009
I am.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.010
So what's
the problem? I'm white.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.011
So?

15:47.012 --> 15:48.012
She's not.
So forget her.

15:48.013 --> 15:49.014
I can't.
Then don't.

15:51.016 --> 15:53.017
We're right back
where we started.

15:53.018 --> 15:56.521
Yeah, but for a while,
it was going very nicely.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.523
Look, it's just not that simple.

15:58.524 --> 16:02.527
I-I don't know
what I'm going to do.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.028
What are you worried about?

16:04.029 --> 16:06.531
Other people.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.033
Danny, all my life,
I've had to worry

16:09.034 --> 16:11.035
about what other people
thought about me,

16:11.036 --> 16:12.537
and I was alone for a long time,

16:12.538 --> 16:14.539
but all I can tell you is this...

16:14.540 --> 16:17.542
if you really love her,
don't let her go,

16:17.543 --> 16:20.044
because you may never
find her again,

16:20.045 --> 16:21.045
and that would be worse

16:21.046 --> 16:24.048
than anything
anybody could ever do to you.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.551
That was beautiful.

16:28.554 --> 16:29.554
Thanks, Jodie.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.556
No problem, Dan.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.057
Just follow your heart.

16:33.058 --> 16:36.060
Hey, are we
going skating or not?

16:36.061 --> 16:37.061
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:37.062 --> 16:39.063
See you later.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.566
Well, I got to get going too.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.068
I got to go meet Polly.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.571
How do you really feel
about this?

16:48.574 --> 16:51.075
Well, I feel life
is sometimes hard,

16:51.076 --> 16:54.579
and it is less than perfect,

16:54.580 --> 16:56.080
but it's your life,

16:56.081 --> 16:57.582
and the choices you make

16:57.583 --> 17:00.084
will be the best choices
for you,

17:00.085 --> 17:02.087
and that's okay with me.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.593
Thanks, Ma.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.598
Oh...

17:24.108 --> 17:26.109
Hi.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.612
Oh, hi, Mary.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.113
So, tell me,

17:29.114 --> 17:31.616
what is the big news?

17:31.617 --> 17:33.618
I've been waiting all morning.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.119
You won't believe it.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.622
You won't believe
what I have to tell you.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.123
Oh, let me guess.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.124
You'll never guess.

17:40.125 --> 17:41.125
Never.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.627
Not in a million years.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.128
It would be the last thing
in the world

17:44.129 --> 17:45.630
that would cross your mind.

17:45.631 --> 17:50.635
We could sit here for days
and you would never think of it.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.639
What are you going to tell me,
that you're pregnant?

18:00.646 --> 18:03.648
Well, you have even managed
to ruin this one.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.149
Oh, Mary.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.651
How wonderful.

18:06.652 --> 18:08.152
You're pregnant?

18:08.153 --> 18:10.154
Oh, that's wonderful.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.157
I'm so happy for you.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.161
Always, whenever
I have had a surprise,

18:17.162 --> 18:18.663
you have managed to ruin it.

18:18.664 --> 18:19.664
When we were little,

18:19.665 --> 18:21.165
you knew what was
in my birthday presents

18:21.166 --> 18:22.667
before I opened them.

18:22.668 --> 18:25.169
You knew I was going
to be engaged before I did.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.671
You probably know
when I'm going to die.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.174
No. When?

18:30.676 --> 18:33.678
Oh, Mary, this is so exciting.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.181
It is the best news
in the world.

18:37.182 --> 18:38.182
Oh...

18:38.183 --> 18:39.684
How do you feel?

18:39.685 --> 18:40.685
Nauseous.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.186
I remember that.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.188
But I'm eating like a pig.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.189
I know.

18:45.190 --> 18:46.190
When I was pregnant,

18:46.191 --> 18:48.192
I sat down
in front of the refrigerator

18:48.193 --> 18:49.193
for nine months

18:49.194 --> 18:50.194
and never moved.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.196
Jessica...

18:52.197 --> 18:54.198
Do you think
I'll be able to do it?

18:54.199 --> 18:56.200
I think you already have.

18:56.201 --> 18:58.202
No, what I mean is,

18:58.203 --> 19:01.706
do you think I'll have
the energy and patience?

19:01.707 --> 19:05.209
It's been a long time
since I've had a baby.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.711
Oh, Mary, don't worry.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.713
It'll be wonderful.

19:08.714 --> 19:09.714
And I'll help.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.215
And if it's a little boy,

19:11.216 --> 19:13.718
it can have Timmy's
hand-me-downs.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.219
Of course,
if it's a little girl,

19:15.220 --> 19:16.721
it can have them too.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.223
I mean, we're not talking
about three-piece suits here.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.725
Don't worry, Mary.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.226
It'll be wonderful,

19:22.227 --> 19:23.728
and I'm going to help you...

19:23.729 --> 19:25.229
wherever I can.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.231
It'll be a piece of cake.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.734
Oh. You have some?

19:29.735 --> 19:31.235
What?

19:31.236 --> 19:32.236
Cake.

19:32.237 --> 19:33.237
Well, I have some cookies.

19:33.238 --> 19:35.740
Anything.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.742
So, how are things with Chester?

19:37.743 --> 19:40.244
Oh, he is working so hard.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.747
He's going to the minister's
counseling sessions

19:42.748 --> 19:46.250
morning, noon, and night.

19:46.251 --> 19:48.252
It is so wonderful to see.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.254
Which ones do you want?

19:50.255 --> 19:52.257
All.

19:54.259 --> 19:57.261
Mary, how does Burt
feel about the baby?

19:57.262 --> 19:59.263
Oh, Burt is thrilled.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.766
We've never had a baby before.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.267
I know.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.770
This will be...

20:05.771 --> 20:08.773
the first...

20:08.774 --> 20:09.774
Oh!

20:09.775 --> 20:11.776
Are you going to throw up?

20:11.777 --> 20:13.277
Jessica!

20:13.278 --> 20:16.781
A bowl.
I'll get you a bowl.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.783
A calendar.
I need a calendar.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.284
Yes, yes, okay.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.786
I really don't think
that's exactly the right thing.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.287
I mean, Mary,

20:23.288 --> 20:25.290
it's going to go right through.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.797
Not a colander. A calendar.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.298
A calendar.

20:34.299 --> 20:35.299
With dates.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.300
Oh. Oh, yes.

20:36.301 --> 20:37.802
A calendar...

20:37.803 --> 20:39.303
Here. Here, Mary.

20:39.304 --> 20:40.304
Here's a calendar.

20:40.305 --> 20:41.305
Oh, this is awful.

20:41.306 --> 20:42.807
This is just so awful.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.811
See, I found saltines helped.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.314
Jessica...

20:50.315 --> 20:52.817
this baby may not be Burt's.

20:52.818 --> 20:53.819
Oh...

20:58.323 --> 21:01.826
Well, it was when Burt
went up to the spaceship

21:01.827 --> 21:04.829
and Alien Burt came down,

21:04.830 --> 21:06.330
and...

21:06.331 --> 21:09.333
I made love with both of them.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.836
It could be either one.

21:11.837 --> 21:13.338
I see.

21:15.841 --> 21:19.343
Well, Mary, did Alien Burt
look like Real Burt?

21:19.344 --> 21:20.344
Exactly.

21:20.345 --> 21:21.846
Well, then
you don't have a problem,

21:21.847 --> 21:23.347
because, you see,

21:23.348 --> 21:25.850
the baby will look like a Burt,
and Burt will never know.

21:25.851 --> 21:32.357
Jessica, Alien Burt
was really a little silver man.

21:34.359 --> 21:36.360
Well, Mary,
if it's a little silver baby,

21:36.361 --> 21:38.363
then we'll know
who the father is.

21:40.365 --> 21:43.367
You know, the Kents
had the same problem.

21:43.368 --> 21:45.369
Fred and Lillian Kent?

21:45.370 --> 21:48.873
No, Mr. and Mrs. Clark Kent.

21:48.874 --> 21:52.877
I don't believe I know them.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.379
Superman and Lois Lane.

21:55.380 --> 21:59.884
If they had a baby,
it might fly.

21:59.885 --> 22:03.387
You see, Mary,
this isn't unusual at all.

22:03.388 --> 22:06.390
I mean, with a baby,
you never know what will happen.

22:06.391 --> 22:08.392
I mean, will it have blue eyes?

22:08.393 --> 22:10.394
Will it be left-handed?

22:10.395 --> 22:11.395
Will it be silver?

22:11.396 --> 22:14.398
Will it fly?

22:14.399 --> 22:18.903
But, whatever you have,
you'll love it just the same.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.419

22:35.420 --> 22:37.421

22:37.422 --> 22:39.423
