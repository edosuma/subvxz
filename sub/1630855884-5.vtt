Growing up, my mom used to tell us
that ravens were the minions of Satan,

00:37.583 --> 00:38.875
'cause Noah threw them--

00:38.875 --> 00:41.666
Threw them overboard

Yeah. Heard that one before.

a seat at the table.

Well, guess what?

10:51.583 --> 10:53.750
I don't need to break through.

10:54.291 --> 10:55.875

Oh, fuck off, Ray-Bans!

11:24.125 --> 11:25.416
That's great, jellybean.

11:25.416 --> 11:27.708
I'm sorry. Can you say that again?

11:27.708 --> 11:30.208
Her blood-ox levels
are looking much better...

11:30.208 --> 11:31.208
Is my name Lenore?

11:31.208 --> 11:34.500
[doctor] Given the damage to her lung,
she'll need to remain on oxygen.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.541
Did you miss me?

11:35.541 --> 11:37.083
[doctor] This is all good news.

covering this much of a body...

11:45.833 --> 11:49.041
She's not a Magic 8 ball, honey.
I'm going to take her home.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.791
I don't think she's bothering her.
I think Morrie's excited to talk to her.

11:52.791 --> 11:54.083
No, I mean Morrie.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.500
I think it's time I take her home.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.333
We've still got a long road to hoe.

11:59.333 --> 12:02.916
We're weeks away from even the possibility
of skin grafts.

12:02.916 --> 12:05.041
We have everything we need at home.

12:05.041 --> 12:07.000
I've been working on this for a little bit

12:07.000 --> 12:09.583
and I'm just about ready
to bring her back.

12:09.583 --> 12:11.583
Um, most patients in her condition

12:11.583 --> 12:15.125
remain in intensive care
for 40 to 80 days.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.541
Most patients in her condition
are not industry royalty.

12:18.541 --> 12:19.916
I could build a suite in one day

12:19.916 --> 12:22.000

- Dad.

12:22.000 --> 12:22.916
It's true.

12:22.916 --> 12:25.458
She's incredibly fragile.

12:26.541 --> 12:30.416
She has zero physical defense,
no protection from--

12:30.416 --> 12:34.458
She has the entire arsenal
of the Usher family.

12:34.458 --> 12:37.125
That's better protection than any patient
you've ever had.

12:37.125 --> 12:40.083
Are you mistaking me for a civilian?
I'm not a fucking civilian.

12:40.083 --> 12:42.416
You think I don't know
what I'm talking about?

12:43.583 --> 12:45.333
No, of course not.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.416
You play your cards right
and don't piss me off,

12:47.416 --> 12:48.875
maybe I'll hire you on.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.291
Morrie, honey.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.958
Honey, we can get through this,
we can do it.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.166
Don't you want to come home?

13:01.041 --> 13:03.000
[Victorine] Are you fucking kidding me?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.416
So, you're going to pull out now?
On the day I buried three of my--

13:06.416 --> 13:10.000
Well, I'm sorry I didn't know
about the fucking surgery until tonight!

13:10.000 --> 13:13.083
I've gotta learn from the office that you
literally booked me

13:13.083 --> 13:16.916
- for surgery next week, Victorine.
- Well, fuck me, I thought you'd be happy.

13:16.916 --> 13:18.041
Who's the candidate?

13:18.041 --> 13:21.541
We're supposed to be partners in this,
I haven't even vetted the candidate.

13:21.541 --> 13:23.875
Look, she's one of yours.
I will get her file.

13:23.875 --> 13:26.583
It doesn't matter
because we're not ready, Victorine!

13:30.083 --> 13:31.166
Do you remember this?

13:34.458 --> 13:35.583
Yeah.

13:35.583 --> 13:36.666
What is it?

13:37.166 --> 13:38.000
Say it.

13:39.291 --> 13:40.750
That's our prototype.

13:40.750 --> 13:43.125
No, baby, it's our beginning.

13:43.958 --> 13:47.041
The first stab at it works, Al.

13:47.041 --> 13:49.208
I know it works. It's not that.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.541
You know what else it is?

13:51.625 --> 13:53.875
$200 million of Roderick Usher's money

13:53.875 --> 13:57.166
and, for some reason, right,
for whatever reason...

13:58.458 --> 14:00.166
he wants it right now.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.541
So if he says human trials,

14:02.541 --> 14:05.166
you'd better believe, babe,
we're doing human trials.

14:05.833 --> 14:08.791
There's no way
you could have gotten clearance for this.

14:16.875 --> 14:17.750
Oh, no.

14:19.291 --> 14:20.833
- No, no, no.
- Okay. Al.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.166
No, Vic. No, you didn't. What did you do?

14:23.166 --> 14:25.333
- Baby, it's not like that.
- You didn't.

14:25.333 --> 14:28.083
No, tell me that my signature
isn't on falsified data.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.708
Listen, the reports are fine.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.125
- Tell me right now...
- It's... It's...

14:31.125 --> 14:35.083
that my signature isn't
on falsified reports, Victorine!

14:35.083 --> 14:37.083
Al, fucking... Don't be a fucking child!

14:38.416 --> 14:40.291
Shit, how do you think
this industry works?

14:42.041 --> 14:45.708
It is... It is filled...

14:46.583 --> 14:49.875
It is hard enough as it is,
and as a woman...

14:50.500 --> 14:53.541
As a woman you should know
it is infinitely harder.

14:53.541 --> 14:54.916
Oh, don't you dare.

14:54.916 --> 14:58.208
You sang a different tune when that money,

14:58.208 --> 14:59.875
my money...

15:00.583 --> 15:04.750
Usher money, Fortunato money,
came rolling into your clinic.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.750
And into your bank account.

15:08.750 --> 15:09.958
Yeah, I think I'm out.

15:10.791 --> 15:12.166
What do you mean, "out"?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.833
You're right. I let this go too far.

15:14.833 --> 15:18.250
Wait, out of... Out of us?

15:19.166 --> 15:20.000
Wow.

15:20.916 --> 15:23.333
You're not gonna say anything, Al,
about the NDA?

15:23.333 --> 15:24.416
Whoa.

15:25.041 --> 15:28.166
Well, it doesn't cover
illegal activities, so...

15:28.166 --> 15:30.708
Yes, it most certainly fucking does.

15:30.708 --> 15:33.791
Yeah, that's a... That is a Pym Special.

15:35.208 --> 15:36.958
And you signed it. And I'm telling...

15:41.375 --> 15:42.416
I'm asking you...

15:43.708 --> 15:45.541
Okay, babe, I'm begging you, please.

15:47.375 --> 15:48.208
Don't do this.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.000
Because they...

15:51.083 --> 15:54.250
they will just rip you apart into pieces

15:54.250 --> 15:57.791
and even after they win, and they will...

15:57.791 --> 16:00.541
Al, they will win. Okay? Please.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.750
Baby, please don't do this.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.041
You're not who I thought you were.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.833
What are you going to do, Al?

16:16.708 --> 16:17.666
Goodbye, Vic.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.083
Wait.

16:20.416 --> 16:22.083
You're not going to tell anyone!

16:22.083 --> 16:23.750
Of course I'm going to tell.

16:24.416 --> 16:28.125
And I don't fucking care if you sue me
or you rip me apart!

16:28.958 --> 16:30.500
You Ushers...

16:31.875 --> 16:33.791
I really didn't want to think it, but...

16:35.166 --> 16:37.083
you're all fucking monsters.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.000
[yells]

16:45.875 --> 16:47.791
[Victorine] <i>Hi, it's me again.</i>

16:47.791 --> 16:49.208
Listen, just...

16:51.666 --> 16:53.208
Look, I am sorry.

16:53.791 --> 16:55.666
Okay, please, just call me back.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.083
We can work this out.

17:00.375 --> 17:03.666
Just... This is my...
This is my third message...

17:05.250 --> 17:07.583
Don't do me like this, please.

17:15.583 --> 17:16.416
[sighs]

17:17.083 --> 17:17.958
[sniffles]

17:21.833 --> 17:23.375
[soft mechanical chirping]

17:32.958 --> 17:34.208
[chirping continues]

17:56.541 --> 17:57.458
Oh.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.375
[beeps]

18:09.583 --> 18:13.000
Oh, my. You didn't take up smoking,
did you?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.041
Oh, no.

18:15.041 --> 18:17.375
It's just chirping. It's weird. Sorry.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.791
How did you get past Kevin Costner
in the hall?

18:19.791 --> 18:23.000
It is for your own protection, all of you,
to keep you safe.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.791
And good morning, how are you?

18:25.875 --> 18:26.750
What do you want?

18:27.625 --> 18:30.750
I'm just making the rounds.
Checking on my ducklings.

18:30.750 --> 18:33.375
Seeing if anything unusual is happening.

18:33.375 --> 18:34.875
[chirping continues]

18:34.875 --> 18:36.625
Sorry. Do you hear that?

18:37.458 --> 18:38.291
Listen.

18:39.041 --> 18:40.416
I hear a delightful rumor

18:40.416 --> 18:43.083
that you're moving forward
with human trials.

18:43.083 --> 18:45.916
- We are working on it.
- When?

18:47.333 --> 18:50.333
Can I ask why you're interested
in HeroVesta all of a sudden?

18:50.333 --> 18:52.000
I'm now taking an interest.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.500
You and Dad.

18:54.375 --> 18:55.583
Lucky me.

18:55.583 --> 18:56.875
It's important.

18:56.875 --> 18:59.750
Maybe the most important thing right now.

19:00.541 --> 19:03.208
We need to get it on a fast track.

19:03.208 --> 19:08.000
So we can implement
a very special human study

19:08.791 --> 19:10.791
on a candidate that will surprise you.

19:11.916 --> 19:14.833
A candidate we cannot risk.
Do you understand?

19:14.833 --> 19:16.041
[chirping echoing]

19:16.041 --> 19:17.708
Am I boring you?

19:17.708 --> 19:20.000
Mmm? No. No, sure.

19:20.791 --> 19:25.041
Look, whilst I appreciate your sudden
and not at all alarming interest

19:25.041 --> 19:27.250
in HeroVesta,
don't you have bigger fish to fry?

19:27.250 --> 19:28.166
Like what?

19:28.166 --> 19:31.208
Not to put too fine a point on it,
but aren't you still on trial?

19:31.208 --> 19:32.125
[scoffs]

19:33.083 --> 19:34.541
Not for much longer,

19:35.458 --> 19:36.291
<i>I would imagine.</i>

19:45.333 --> 19:47.458
You know, I think I see where they get it.

19:47.458 --> 19:48.416
The Pym Reaper.

19:49.625 --> 19:51.958
If only we had a chessboard and a beach.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.250
Hmm.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.708
Love Bergman.

19:56.541 --> 19:58.708
Can I ask you something
man to man, Arthur?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.083
Yes, Auguste.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.375
You're a smart man.

20:04.375 --> 20:06.916
You could be anywhere, doing anything.

20:07.833 --> 20:10.000
You know what they are,
why do you do this?

20:10.625 --> 20:14.125
I wouldn't be where I am today
without Roderick Usher.

20:16.041 --> 20:17.541
Neither would you, by the way.

20:19.333 --> 20:21.041
Apologies for the wait, gentlemen.

20:22.208 --> 20:26.166
We're here during my lunch hour
to discuss the recent tragedies

20:26.166 --> 20:28.666
that have been suffered by the defense,

20:29.625 --> 20:34.291
and Mr. Pym's motion for a continuance.

20:34.291 --> 20:35.208
[Auguste] Why?

20:35.208 --> 20:37.833
None of the deceased
were defendants in this trial.

20:37.833 --> 20:40.208
Mr. Dupin insinuated early on

20:40.208 --> 20:42.666
that there was an informant close
to the family,

20:42.666 --> 20:46.708
and since then, we believe
the family is under attack.

20:46.708 --> 20:49.500
I was told these deaths were accidental.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.625
We are still investigating, Your Honor,

20:51.625 --> 20:55.208
but a continuance is warranted
and needed in this case.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.916
I wouldn't have thought counsel
would be this opportunistic,

20:57.916 --> 20:59.875
but I suppose I'm not surprised.

20:59.875 --> 21:03.291
- Just what is he implying?
- Three dead bodies in a week, Mr. Dupin.

21:03.291 --> 21:05.333
And until we know why this happened,

21:05.333 --> 21:08.250
and how it's related
to Mr. Dupin's informant--

21:08.250 --> 21:09.666
I'm sorry, who said it's related?

21:09.666 --> 21:11.958
How can we know it isn't?
You won't disclose.

21:11.958 --> 21:13.291
For their safety.

21:13.291 --> 21:16.666
Continuance isn't the end
of the world, Mr. Dupin.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.041
But, Your Honor, this is bullshit!

21:19.666 --> 21:25.166
This family has repeatedly managed
to evade prosecution,

21:25.166 --> 21:27.375
no matter how much evidence
stacked against them,

21:27.375 --> 21:28.750
no matter how many testified,

21:28.750 --> 21:33.083
no matter how many bodies they pile up,
they always slip through the cracks.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.083
It's almost supernatural, Your Honor.

21:35.583 --> 21:37.666
And you're going to let them do it again.

21:37.666 --> 21:38.916
I'm gonna go ahead and assume

21:38.916 --> 21:41.083
you're not intending to imply
what you're implying.

21:41.083 --> 21:44.916
- I'm not implying anything, Your Honor.
- Your Honor, if I may?

21:44.916 --> 21:47.958
Perhaps we can avoid a continuance
after all.

21:48.958 --> 21:52.708
Mr. Dupin can help us cut through
this mess

21:52.708 --> 21:55.541
if he simply identifies his informant

21:55.541 --> 21:58.791
and allows an investigation
to take its course.

22:00.791 --> 22:02.583
[Roderick] <i>Who was it, by the way?</i>

22:03.958 --> 22:05.666
I mean, things all got so... Well...

22:06.750 --> 22:07.916
You know how they got.

22:07.916 --> 22:09.916
I guess it got lost in the shuffle,

22:09.916 --> 22:12.541
but it doesn't possibly
matter now, Auggie.

22:15.708 --> 22:19.125
Just... out of curiosity.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.333
Who was it?

22:22.916 --> 22:24.083
Who was your informant?

22:26.083 --> 22:29.541
Oh, come on. I get why
you didn't answer that day,

22:29.541 --> 22:32.208
but now, Auggie, it's done, it's all over.

22:38.791 --> 22:39.833
[sighs]

22:40.833 --> 22:42.291
There was never an informant.

22:45.125 --> 22:47.125
Oh, I'm impressed, Auggie.

22:47.125 --> 22:49.916
- I didn't think that you had it in you.
- Come on.

22:49.916 --> 22:51.916
There's no ethics to your defense,

22:51.916 --> 22:53.750
and I'm supposed to run
my case by the book.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.541
There's even more scrutiny on me

22:55.541 --> 22:57.625
because you're so unscrupulous so, yeah,

22:57.625 --> 23:00.291
one time I play your way.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.958
Relax, Auggie, I mean it.

23:01.958 --> 23:04.208
It was good.
This would have been a fun one.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.166
I'm as sorry as you
we couldn't play it through.

23:07.166 --> 23:10.833
Watching you shit on your principles
would have been worth every fucking penny.

23:10.833 --> 23:13.166
- Fuck you.
- Drag me, you fucking honey badger.

23:13.166 --> 23:15.541
We got you off your white horse
and down in the mud.

23:15.541 --> 23:18.208
I shouldn't have pointed at the kids.

23:18.208 --> 23:21.375
But, Roderick, if I'd thought for a moment
they'd start dying--

23:21.375 --> 23:22.291
Easy there.

23:22.291 --> 23:24.375
No. Let's play in the mud. You're right.

23:24.375 --> 23:27.250
I pointed at the kids,
figured it would stir you all up.

23:27.916 --> 23:31.375
Pressure the fault lines.
Maybe even pitch you against each other.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.291
Hell, you might eat each other alive

23:33.291 --> 23:35.625
but, hey, it could finally crack
the fortress.

23:35.625 --> 23:37.625
Let you all knock it down from inside.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.708
But, Roderick, I didn't imagine
for a moment

23:40.708 --> 23:42.166
the kids would start dying.

23:42.166 --> 23:44.291
Figured you might torture them a bit.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.625
But I never imagined in a million years
any of them would end up dead.

23:50.625 --> 23:52.500
You really stepped in it this time.

23:52.500 --> 23:56.666
Why, if it weren't for you,
they would all still be alive today.

24:02.833 --> 24:05.375
[heart thumping]

24:11.416 --> 24:13.416
[thumping continues]

24:22.666 --> 24:25.875
[screaming]

24:28.958 --> 24:30.958
- [gasps]
- [thunder rumbling]

24:32.500 --> 24:34.125
[sighs]

24:37.000 --> 24:39.125
Auggie, let me relieve you of that burden.

24:42.875 --> 24:44.708
No one died for your lie.

24:48.708 --> 24:50.000
So don't carry that.

24:55.166 --> 24:57.416
You see, one had nothing to do
with the other.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.583
So, just...

25:01.333 --> 25:02.625
You can let that go.

25:06.666 --> 25:08.125
And the mind of guilt...

25:12.250 --> 25:13.541
is full of scorpions.

25:15.708 --> 25:17.833
And I wouldn't wish their sting on anyone.

25:21.291 --> 25:23.291
<i>Never waste your time on guilt or shame.</i>

25:24.125 --> 25:27.958
<i>Is their alchemy a savage cross to bear?</i>

25:28.833 --> 25:30.500
And he'll change everything.

25:30.500 --> 25:33.916
You could track how many prescriptions
of your drugs are being written.

25:33.916 --> 25:35.958
Know which drugs are underperforming
and where.

25:35.958 --> 25:40.166
Customize your sales force,
annihilate the competition.

25:40.166 --> 25:42.666
Yeah, but I don't much love computers.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.750
- And they take up half the building and...
- They'll only get smaller.

25:45.750 --> 25:47.625
Much smaller, and fast,

25:47.625 --> 25:50.041
and you're expanding anyway, aren't you?

25:50.041 --> 25:53.416
- Roddie says you're building a new campus?
- We are. Yeah.

25:55.625 --> 25:56.875
Well, I, you know...

25:58.291 --> 25:59.125
I'm interested.

26:00.333 --> 26:02.291
Well, that is forward thinking of you.

26:02.291 --> 26:06.083
Not many men want to listen to me talk
about tech for half an hour.

26:06.083 --> 26:07.375
Oh, I doubt that.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.458
Well, maybe not the radio version, anyway.

26:11.958 --> 26:14.875
I'm happy to answer any questions
you might have.

26:14.875 --> 26:16.375
How do you take your coffee?

26:17.458 --> 26:19.291
How do you take your morning coffee?

26:19.291 --> 26:21.333
That's top of my mind for me right now.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.250
In solitude.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.083
Uh-huh.

26:29.416 --> 26:31.791
So, this computer...

26:32.541 --> 26:34.000
what, company that you're pitching,

26:34.000 --> 26:35.500
- this is your company?
- Yes.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.708
And why would a woman
want to run her own company?

26:39.291 --> 26:40.583
Same reason a man would.

26:40.583 --> 26:42.916
Yeah, I get it, but why go it alone?

26:43.583 --> 26:46.708
You could be doing more sitting
at that desk outside my door

26:46.708 --> 26:48.708
in one day than you could on your own.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.666
A secretary can't build you an algorithm
to triple your sales--

26:51.666 --> 26:55.333
You think you're the first to walk in here
with a computer infrastructure pitch?

26:55.333 --> 26:59.041
You're right, we're expanding,
and we are buying all that stuff already.

26:59.041 --> 27:01.083
I'm not sure why you're talking
to me this way.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.791
Take a guess, sweetheart,
you're a pretty smart girl.

27:07.583 --> 27:08.500
Mmm.

27:10.041 --> 27:12.541
Smart girls are only sexy
until they don't wanna fuck you,

27:12.541 --> 27:14.916
and then they're competition,
and then what do you do?

27:14.916 --> 27:16.125
You take them down a peg.

27:17.916 --> 27:22.125
Well, Roderick Usher's sister. Mmm.

27:23.333 --> 27:25.625
It's funny,
I just had a very interesting conversation

27:25.625 --> 27:29.458
with Roderick Usher only a few days ago,
and now suddenly his sister's in my office

27:29.458 --> 27:33.833
to pitch me some sort of computer thing
that will require me to, what?

27:34.958 --> 27:36.708
Computerize all our records, right?

27:37.708 --> 27:40.500
"Why don't you let me take
all those sensitive company papers

27:40.500 --> 27:42.500
that my brother was just talking about

27:42.500 --> 27:46.125
out of the basement
and computerize them for you."

27:47.083 --> 27:52.250
And even if this is innocent,
well, I don't know just what to do.

27:54.333 --> 27:57.250
So you figured you'd humiliate me?

27:57.250 --> 27:59.958
No. No, no, no.
No, I don't wanna humiliate you.

28:01.166 --> 28:02.000
I don't need to.

28:03.833 --> 28:07.166
You do realize the entire company
knows about you, right?

28:08.125 --> 28:11.875
Yeah, you're the go-to gossip
around here for decades.

28:12.541 --> 28:14.250
You two are an office fairytale.

28:15.250 --> 28:20.250
Longfellow knocks up his secretary.
Ooh. Such a scandal.

28:21.916 --> 28:23.000
I was here, you know?

28:23.875 --> 28:25.166
I worked for your father.

28:26.583 --> 28:27.875
I knew your mother.

28:27.875 --> 28:32.000
And she was a great secretary.
She was a full-service secretary.

28:34.666 --> 28:35.916
Until her brain rotted.

28:37.625 --> 28:39.208
Until she killed a giant.

28:39.208 --> 28:42.250
Until she killed a great man.

28:44.875 --> 28:47.250
And it must have been so tough
for you growing up.

28:48.416 --> 28:50.916
I don't know why he didn't
just claim you as heirs.

28:50.916 --> 28:52.750
Would have made such a difference.

28:53.250 --> 28:54.958
Everybody knew about you anyway,

28:54.958 --> 28:58.125
but here you both are,
working the mail room.

28:59.125 --> 29:01.541
Pitching from the fringes.

29:01.541 --> 29:05.750
I don't need nor want to humiliate you,
you're doing fine on your own.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.416
And I know it's not your fault.

29:08.416 --> 29:12.166
But hey, it worked out pretty good for me,
what with the old man gone.

29:12.166 --> 29:14.416
That's the way this business works.

29:14.416 --> 29:18.125
Chairs empty out, sad to say,
but they don't stay empty long.

29:18.125 --> 29:20.041
So I'm grateful for that part of it.

29:20.750 --> 29:24.166
So don't misread me here, Madeline,
I'm actually on your side.

29:24.708 --> 29:25.583
You and Roderick.

29:26.583 --> 29:27.666
I'm helping. Ask him.

29:28.375 --> 29:29.625
I'm giving him a hand up.

29:30.625 --> 29:32.208
And I can do the same for you.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.083
It just has to make sense.

29:36.500 --> 29:39.625
So just don't... And this is important...

29:41.416 --> 29:43.083
Don't fuck with me, Madeline.

29:43.083 --> 29:45.875
Either of you. Do not fuck with me.

29:51.708 --> 29:56.375
Fuck me, now that's fine.
Hell, you'll climb that ladder fast.

29:56.375 --> 29:58.791
Men have to climb
on their bellies in the dirt,

29:58.791 --> 30:01.041
but women, they can climb it
on their backs.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.083
On their knees.

30:03.083 --> 30:08.666
World's unfair that way, but it works,
so you can fuck me any time you want.

30:12.333 --> 30:17.708
But don't you ever fuck with me,
Madeline Usher. Do you get me?

30:19.916 --> 30:20.750
I get you.

30:21.916 --> 30:23.041
[Annabel] <i>That's disgusting.</i>

30:23.916 --> 30:24.750
That's men.

30:25.500 --> 30:28.458
I don't understand why you went
in there in the first place.

30:28.958 --> 30:30.375
To look him in the eye.

30:30.375 --> 30:32.666
Now I know what we're up against
and it's not much.

30:32.666 --> 30:35.333
Testosterone, hubris, aftershave.

30:36.541 --> 30:37.708
I'm relieved.

30:37.708 --> 30:39.875
I mean, shit. What if he was smart?

30:39.875 --> 30:41.916
Don't have to be smart to be dangerous.

30:41.916 --> 30:44.375
I'm not scared of rattlesnakes
'cause they're so smart.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.083
[Auguste] He's smart, all right.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.625
Don't misjudge him, he's misjudged you.

30:48.625 --> 30:52.166
Don't make the same mistake.
People misjudge me all the time.

30:52.708 --> 30:53.708
Everywhere I go.

30:54.916 --> 30:56.291
Used to make my blood boil.

30:57.375 --> 30:58.291
But now I get it.

30:59.166 --> 31:00.250
It's an opportunity.

31:01.875 --> 31:04.458
He's underestimated you. That's a gift.

31:04.458 --> 31:06.541
A failure of imagination.

31:07.458 --> 31:09.708
He sees you as formidable, he locks down,

31:09.708 --> 31:12.708
closes ranks, shuts the doors,
battens the hatches.

31:12.708 --> 31:16.250
But... he doesn't think much of you,
either of you.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.000
And that's great for us.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.208
[Madeline] I agree.

31:21.333 --> 31:22.833
This one gets it, Roddie.

31:22.833 --> 31:24.333
[Auguste] So we learned two things.

31:24.333 --> 31:26.958
First, he isn't worried about you,
which is great.

31:26.958 --> 31:30.625
And second... those records still exist.

31:31.458 --> 31:32.541
In hard copy.

31:33.166 --> 31:34.125
In the basement.

31:34.708 --> 31:37.375
Best time to destroy them
will be during construction.

31:37.375 --> 31:39.833
They can get lost in the move
to the new campus,

31:39.833 --> 31:43.041
disappear quietly before everything
gets computerized.

31:43.041 --> 31:45.708
So, that gives us our clock too.

31:45.708 --> 31:49.083
I don't like this. I'm sorry, I don't.

31:49.083 --> 31:50.541
[Auguste] And you're right.

31:50.541 --> 31:51.958
This is dangerous.

31:53.666 --> 31:58.500
And once we do this next part,
there is no going back.

32:03.583 --> 32:04.666
Well, we're doing it.

32:12.375 --> 32:13.875
[Roderick] <i>So what are we looking at?</i>

32:19.666 --> 32:20.916
And this.

32:22.125 --> 32:23.625
This is from Leo's phone.

32:29.916 --> 32:31.708
Double the security detail.

32:31.708 --> 32:35.666
It's ridiculous. Leo jumped off a balcony,
Julius saw it.

32:35.666 --> 32:37.291
No one in the room with Cami,

32:37.291 --> 32:39.333
and no one could have made
these things happen.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.875
[Madeline] I know that face.

32:40.875 --> 32:44.083
I really had to dig back
and I thought I was a little nuts

32:44.083 --> 32:47.416
but I thought it through again and again
and I can't deny it.

32:47.416 --> 32:50.250
I know that face. You know her too.

32:51.250 --> 32:53.375
New Year's Eve 1980.

32:53.375 --> 32:55.291
That New Year's.

32:55.791 --> 32:58.500
Don't tell me you don't remember.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.875
- Arthur, please leave us.
- No, he stays.

33:01.500 --> 33:04.833
I'm sorry, you just mentioned New Year's
in front of another person.

33:04.833 --> 33:06.958
We don't have many rules,
but that one's yours.

33:06.958 --> 33:08.083
So you remember?

33:09.083 --> 33:11.250
- 'Course I remember.
- You remember that bar?

33:11.250 --> 33:12.416
I remember a bar.

33:12.416 --> 33:14.875
You stubborn, stubborn man.

33:14.875 --> 33:20.083
I remember we were drunk
and maybe a little high,

33:20.083 --> 33:22.541
and definitely a little fucking distracted
that night.

33:22.541 --> 33:25.291
And since we've both sworn
to never discuss that night again,

33:25.291 --> 33:27.208
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:27.208 --> 33:29.583
But let me take the ride with you, Mads.

33:30.916 --> 33:32.833
You're saying that imaginary bartender

33:32.833 --> 33:35.541
that you dreamed up 40 years ago is back,

33:35.541 --> 33:37.333
hasn't aged a day and is--

33:37.333 --> 33:40.458
Maybe I'm saying,
"Gee, Roderick, did you happen to,

33:40.458 --> 33:44.458
I don't know, fuck that pretty bartender
all those years ago?"

33:44.458 --> 33:46.708
"Now you've got another heir
running around,

33:46.708 --> 33:48.541
and maybe this one's psychotic."

33:49.666 --> 33:51.083
Tell me everything.

33:51.083 --> 33:55.291
This woman looks remarkably like
a certain bartender we met back in 1980

33:55.291 --> 33:57.291
just up the street from here, in fact.

33:57.291 --> 33:58.583
The bar's long gone now.

33:58.583 --> 34:01.458
I already checked, but I know I'm right.

34:01.458 --> 34:05.250
And since my brother likes to stick
his dick into anything that moves,

34:05.250 --> 34:08.791
you've got new bastards popping up
like new smart phones,

34:08.791 --> 34:13.083
and maybe this one is crazy
and wants to be first in line.

34:14.166 --> 34:18.125
Beef up security, let Pym do what he does.

34:18.125 --> 34:19.208
[Arthur] I'm on it.

34:19.208 --> 34:23.708
I assume I'm authorized to negotiate
on your behalf with this individual?

34:23.708 --> 34:27.500
Unless you object right now,
I assume I'm authorized

34:27.500 --> 34:32.458
to approach these negotiations
from a... hostile posture.

34:34.375 --> 34:37.583
Text me the location of the bar,
where it used to be, anyway.

34:38.625 --> 34:39.625
I'll go from there.

34:40.250 --> 34:43.958
I'll return with the receipt.
Once the transaction is complete.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.666
Her eyes, Arthur.

34:47.375 --> 34:48.208
The receipt.

34:49.416 --> 34:51.291
I'd like it to be her eyes.

34:51.291 --> 34:52.541
Both of them.

34:52.541 --> 34:53.458
Extracted.

34:54.458 --> 34:55.291
With patience.

34:59.291 --> 35:01.583
[Victorine] I know
you're having second thoughts

35:01.583 --> 35:03.083
and that's totally normal.

35:03.833 --> 35:09.916
But this... this might be the single
most important thing you've ever done.

35:10.375 --> 35:11.375
[chuckles]

35:12.166 --> 35:14.166
It might be the most important thing
you ever do,

35:14.166 --> 35:17.875
and I'm, well, you know what,
I'm jealous of you, quite frankly.

35:17.875 --> 35:20.166
It's not that I don't want to be
an important person.

35:20.166 --> 35:22.375
I mean, who doesn't?

35:22.375 --> 35:23.458
- I just...
- [chirping]

35:24.541 --> 35:26.583
it's about being the first.

35:27.833 --> 35:29.166
That's where I get scared.

35:29.708 --> 35:32.416
[distorted] Just because
it's all happening so fast.

35:32.416 --> 35:34.958
I suppose I'd feel better as well

35:34.958 --> 35:37.166
- if I could talk to Dr. Ruiz.
- [chirping]

35:37.166 --> 35:38.083
I'm sorry?

35:39.666 --> 35:41.125
What's more important to you...

35:42.041 --> 35:45.916
being famous or saving lives?

35:47.125 --> 35:49.333
You've always dreamed about one of those.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.208
Not so much the other.

35:52.708 --> 35:55.166
Ever think the balance was off
in that equation?

35:55.750 --> 35:57.125
As a scientist, I mean.

35:57.125 --> 35:58.500
Excuse me?

35:58.500 --> 36:01.708
Dr. Ruiz, she's supposed to be performing
my surgery

36:01.708 --> 36:03.500
and I haven't gotten to talk to her yet.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.541
I'd kind of like to hear
what she has to say about it.

36:06.541 --> 36:08.500
- I'm... I'm sorry. Just...
- [chirping]

36:10.333 --> 36:11.166
Do you...

36:12.416 --> 36:14.125
Do you hear that?

36:14.666 --> 36:15.500
Hear what?

36:16.416 --> 36:17.666
[chirping continues]

36:17.666 --> 36:21.541
Dr. Ruiz, yes, of course she is...
She's performing the surgery.

36:22.208 --> 36:23.083
Really?

36:23.083 --> 36:24.166
Yes.

36:27.041 --> 36:29.708
Do you know the term
"operant conditioning"?

36:30.333 --> 36:33.666
It's what a horse has that lets them know

36:34.250 --> 36:37.791
a rider might be nervous or hesitant.

36:38.291 --> 36:40.458
- [chirping intensifies]
- They read erratic behavior.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.625
Not fear, not exactly.

36:44.250 --> 36:47.666
But animals learn real quick
to avoid that person.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.166
That's you. In a nutshell.

36:52.375 --> 36:54.916
You're so out of touch
with your human side...

36:56.083 --> 36:59.875
you can't even listen to anything outside
your own head.

36:59.875 --> 37:01.458
You really don't hear that?

37:03.458 --> 37:05.958
- [chirping stops]
- Do have Dr. Ruiz give me a call.

37:06.708 --> 37:09.916
And if she says I should do this,
I'll do it.

37:10.958 --> 37:12.416
No questions asked.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.500
[sighs]

37:18.291 --> 37:20.875
[mechanical chirping]

37:26.041 --> 37:28.458
[phone ringing]

37:28.458 --> 37:31.666
Shit.

37:33.250 --> 37:34.958
Oh, shit.

37:37.500 --> 37:40.166
[voicemail] <i>You've reached
Alessandra Ruiz. Leave a message.</i>

37:40.166 --> 37:41.625
- [beeps]
- [sighs]

37:42.208 --> 37:43.041
It's me again.

37:43.708 --> 37:46.125
Listen, you have to call me back,

37:46.125 --> 37:47.541
I am losing it.

37:47.541 --> 37:49.833
Every time the phone rings,
I think it's you,

37:49.833 --> 37:51.166
and every time it's not, I get...

37:53.208 --> 37:54.416
Please, Ali.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.083
Please.

37:56.750 --> 37:58.916
Look, she'll do the trial if you will.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.375
This all hinges on you.

38:03.333 --> 38:04.166
I love...

38:09.166 --> 38:11.875
I will give you anything you want.

38:12.708 --> 38:13.833
Just name your price.

38:18.791 --> 38:20.916
- [chirping]
- [sighs]

38:27.125 --> 38:29.541
[operatic music playing]

38:34.583 --> 38:37.291
Could have saved some room
and brought another bouquet.

38:37.750 --> 38:38.791
I know, I know.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.416
I know, it's better for the environment.

38:42.166 --> 38:45.541
Watching a plant grow is more therapeutic
than if it's in a bouquet.

38:45.541 --> 38:48.708
Who wants to watch their favorite flower
die slowly in a vase?

38:48.708 --> 38:49.708
[chuckles]

38:50.708 --> 38:53.083
It's looking good so far.
You built it so fast.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.125
Hmm.

38:54.125 --> 38:55.875
Better look good. It cost enough.

38:58.416 --> 38:59.958
Are there gonna be reporters?

38:59.958 --> 39:01.041
When she comes home?

39:02.416 --> 39:03.666
Probably.

39:03.666 --> 39:04.583
I hate that.

39:05.166 --> 39:06.333
Well, just talk to Pym.

39:07.208 --> 39:09.500
He'll tell you what to say
or what not to say.

39:10.458 --> 39:11.625
That feels so gross.

39:16.125 --> 39:16.958
Come here.

39:23.291 --> 39:25.750
You understand who we are in the world,
don't you?

39:26.875 --> 39:29.041
We're part of a kingdom.
We're like royalty.

39:29.833 --> 39:31.541
People fear that. They envy that.

39:32.458 --> 39:35.083
They want to tear it down.
They want to tear us down.

39:36.416 --> 39:38.208
Now, do you know that I've had...

39:38.916 --> 39:43.625
Eleven personal death threats
since I turned 30? Not Fortunato. Me.

39:44.291 --> 39:48.541
Someone once mailed me a bullet
with my name etched in the casing.

39:49.333 --> 39:51.791
Now you don't have to worry about that.
Not now.

39:51.791 --> 39:52.708
But you will.

39:54.000 --> 39:54.875
Someday soon.

39:57.333 --> 40:00.250
Now, if you could see
the paper trail of shit

40:00.250 --> 40:03.666
that Pym has protected this family
from over the years,

40:03.666 --> 40:06.041
it's... it's thicker than a phonebook.

40:06.041 --> 40:08.041
That's what that man does for us.

40:08.041 --> 40:10.916
So, if he tells you to say something,
you say it.

40:11.666 --> 40:15.666
If he says to keep quiet about something,
you keep quiet.

40:15.666 --> 40:17.541
Because he's also protecting you.

40:20.166 --> 40:21.000
Okay.

40:21.708 --> 40:22.666
I'm sorry.

40:23.625 --> 40:24.458
Attagirl.

40:25.875 --> 40:27.041
You've got to be smart.

40:28.083 --> 40:31.291
You have to realize,
you can't trust people.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.500
Not you. Not anyone.

40:35.208 --> 40:38.166
Hell... look at your own mother.

40:38.166 --> 40:39.166
[scoffs]

40:39.750 --> 40:42.625
Your mother, who looked us in the eyes...

40:43.750 --> 40:47.625
and said that she was going out
with her girlfriends that night. And lied.

40:48.458 --> 40:49.708
Your own mother who lied.

40:53.875 --> 40:55.458
I'm so glad Mama's coming home.

40:56.208 --> 40:57.041
So she can heal.

40:58.708 --> 41:00.125
So we can all start to heal.

41:01.041 --> 41:02.583
[sighs] Yes.

41:09.791 --> 41:10.916
We've almost got her.

41:28.541 --> 41:30.708
[indistinct chatter]

41:35.750 --> 41:37.083
[sighs] God.

41:37.083 --> 41:39.458
You can't be fucking serious.

41:41.625 --> 41:42.458
Ma'am?

41:43.625 --> 41:44.750
Who are you talking to?

41:46.333 --> 41:47.166
I'm sorry?

41:47.750 --> 41:50.875
Do you have a date out here?
Keep it down, I'm trying to work.

41:50.875 --> 41:52.875
Ma'am, I haven't been talking to anyone.

41:53.375 --> 41:57.166
[Bill] Jesus, Tam, did you just
fall asleep in mid-sentence?

41:58.041 --> 41:58.875
No!

42:00.500 --> 42:03.125
But... say that again.

42:03.125 --> 42:05.500
I was just saying,
just, like, a few weeks.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.208
Just a postponement.

42:07.208 --> 42:09.833
For the last time,
we're not postponing the launch.

42:09.833 --> 42:11.958
With everything that's happened,
you need a break.

42:12.708 --> 42:16.250
Listen to me, Bill, because I really don't
wanna go through this again.

42:16.250 --> 42:18.375
The optics will be fine.

42:18.375 --> 42:21.291
A few "my heart will go on" tweets
will pad it out.

42:21.291 --> 42:23.625
You can't even sit upright
because you're so tired.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.375
I haven't seen you sleep in like...

42:26.208 --> 42:29.666
I mean, it's been a fucking long time,
Tammy. Like, horror movie long.

42:29.666 --> 42:30.958
Well, Billy Boy,

42:30.958 --> 42:33.958
I guess that's why you're in front
of the camera and not me, right?

42:33.958 --> 42:36.625
You're making approvals
you don't even remember making.

42:36.625 --> 42:39.333
- Every executive does that.
- The trial's been suspended, Tam.

42:39.333 --> 42:41.708
The trial! If what is happening right now

42:41.708 --> 42:45.041
feels like a bridge too far
to the United States government,

42:45.041 --> 42:47.000
maybe take a page out of their book!

42:47.000 --> 42:50.125
Absolutely not.
I would like to be successful.

42:50.125 --> 42:53.708
Okay, then, do it for me, please.
As a favor.

42:53.708 --> 42:56.000
Did you just say do it for you?

42:57.166 --> 42:58.000
For you?

42:58.625 --> 42:59.500
[chuckles]

42:59.500 --> 43:03.333
I'm sorry, Bill, just who do you think
you are in this?

43:04.250 --> 43:07.625
You have one job, you smile,
you jazz-ercise,

43:07.625 --> 43:10.333
and you bring that army of fitness fuckers
with you.

43:10.333 --> 43:15.416
You are a face, you're not a mouthpiece,
so just smile and shut the fuck up.

43:17.875 --> 43:18.708
Okay, then.

43:19.666 --> 43:22.291
From a strictly business perspective,

43:22.291 --> 43:25.375
you can't sell health...
unless you look healthy.

43:25.375 --> 43:28.500
If you try to tell me what to do
with my business one more time--

43:28.500 --> 43:30.833
- Our business. Ours.
- That's cute.

43:30.833 --> 43:36.208
I have hand selected every single aspect
of this company.

43:36.208 --> 43:39.875
Every single aspect, including you.

43:39.875 --> 43:41.000
- BILLT.
- Hey now.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.083
Let's just finally say it.

43:43.083 --> 43:47.333
You were selected. You were chosen.
You headhunted.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.500
Baby, we met at VidCon.

43:49.500 --> 43:53.125
Did you think that was an accident?
I had a list.

43:53.125 --> 43:55.375
I think I still have the grid I made.

43:55.375 --> 43:57.625
It was between you and Yogi Yohann.

43:57.625 --> 43:59.416
You are just trying to hurt me.

43:59.416 --> 44:00.708
No, honey, it's true.

44:00.708 --> 44:04.583
You fit the brand better than Yogi.
And you were so eager.

44:04.583 --> 44:07.708
And it worked out pretty well
before the head got boring,

44:07.708 --> 44:10.958
but never forget,
I can easily replace you.

44:10.958 --> 44:15.083
I'll just find another fitness guru
with a hot ass and a snappy slogan.

44:16.083 --> 44:16.916
Wow.

44:18.333 --> 44:21.666
I mean, there is no Goldbug
without me, Tammy.

44:21.666 --> 44:24.250
It isn't a lifestyle brand without me.

44:24.250 --> 44:25.416
That is what I bring.

44:25.416 --> 44:30.458
Without me, it is just
a lowly-ass box of cosmetics.

44:30.458 --> 44:32.916
- Fucking stop it! Stop it!
- What the...

44:34.083 --> 44:37.083
Don't stand there and look all hurt,
you asshole.

44:37.083 --> 44:38.625
You think I don't know.

44:38.625 --> 44:40.875
You are fucking that whore behind my back.

44:40.875 --> 44:43.666
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- You think I'm stupid?

44:43.666 --> 44:46.291
I have seen her on four
of your streams, BILLT.

44:46.291 --> 44:50.000
The bodyguard out there saw you two taking
a walk in the park this afternoon!

44:50.000 --> 44:53.291
That was you, you psycho!
I was walking with you!

44:53.291 --> 44:54.708
You're fucking some whore!

44:54.708 --> 44:57.958
Some fucking knock-off off-brand me!

44:57.958 --> 45:02.041
It is pathetic, so yes,
forgive me for finally being honest,

45:02.041 --> 45:03.875
but you are a product!

45:03.875 --> 45:07.125
You are a fucking mascot,

45:07.125 --> 45:10.083
and don't forget,
I own the BILLT name now,

45:10.083 --> 45:11.541
so you are an asset.

45:11.541 --> 45:14.708
And I don't care who you fuck,
as stupid as that sounds,

45:14.708 --> 45:19.208
but if you fuck me on this launch,
I will fuck a trench through you.

45:19.208 --> 45:21.458
You are losing it, honey.

45:21.458 --> 45:27.250
And those girls, the goddamn hookers,
that was always you!

45:27.250 --> 45:30.500
And I always fucking hated it! I hated it!

45:31.416 --> 45:33.291
Every minute of it!

45:33.291 --> 45:34.208
You done?

45:36.958 --> 45:39.166
I walk out that door
and I'm not coming back.

45:39.750 --> 45:40.916
Fucking great.

45:52.875 --> 45:54.750
[Roderick] <i>You must be enjoying this.</i>

45:57.500 --> 46:00.041
This impossible... bullshit.

46:02.583 --> 46:03.500
Never touched her.

46:04.166 --> 46:06.166
Well, no more than Mads did. Anyway...

46:07.833 --> 46:08.666
The truth.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.083
It's impossible anyway. Isn't it?

46:12.083 --> 46:14.208
- [metallic clinking]
- Fuck you too.

46:16.791 --> 46:20.250
Maybe this is just a psycho bastard
like she said. Maybe it's nothing.

46:22.583 --> 46:23.833
Maybe I'm losing my mind.

46:25.875 --> 46:27.541
The doctor says not to trust it.

46:31.708 --> 46:33.625
And dementia's a nasty little bitch.

46:35.833 --> 46:38.166
Or maybe I know
what's actually happening here.

46:41.041 --> 46:42.333
Crazy as it sounds.

46:44.041 --> 46:48.750
If all this crazy bullshit is right,
then maybe I know how to stop it.

46:49.875 --> 46:50.708
You dare me?

46:54.583 --> 46:55.458
Mmm.

46:58.166 --> 46:59.833
Take 'em five at a time.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.625
You'll go to sleep on the chair.

47:06.708 --> 47:08.125
Won't feel a thing.

47:12.500 --> 47:13.625
Just drift...

47:17.833 --> 47:18.666
off.

47:26.041 --> 47:28.750
Of course, not the best look
for your product.

47:33.250 --> 47:36.458
This khopesh was in someone's belly
circa 2000 BCE.

47:41.333 --> 47:44.375
Just go out like a warrior
in ancient Egypt.

47:45.958 --> 47:46.833
[strains]

47:47.458 --> 47:49.916
[strains, sighs]

47:51.666 --> 47:55.083
Takes 10 seconds to fall 70 floors.
That's no time at all.

47:56.041 --> 47:59.625
And you don't even feel it.
You fucking... You can do 10 seconds.

48:01.291 --> 48:02.916
Some wind in your hair.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.416
That's quite a view.

48:14.375 --> 48:15.458
[laughs]

48:23.333 --> 48:24.166
[gasps]

48:26.250 --> 48:27.333
Wasn't so hard.

48:29.875 --> 48:31.125
You fucking coward.

48:34.041 --> 48:35.375
You fucking coward.

48:38.458 --> 48:40.625
Ten seconds, you'd save them all.

48:41.333 --> 48:42.416
[exhales]

48:50.666 --> 48:51.875
[upbeat music playing]

48:51.875 --> 48:52.791
[Victorine] Oh.

48:53.500 --> 48:54.333
Dad.

49:02.416 --> 49:03.541
Will you turn it down?

49:09.166 --> 49:10.250
[volume decreases]

49:12.375 --> 49:13.250
Um...

49:14.291 --> 49:15.708
What... What are you doing here?

49:15.708 --> 49:17.791
Well, I was just... I... Well...

49:17.791 --> 49:19.958
I think we should talk, if that's okay.

49:21.333 --> 49:22.166
Yeah, okay.

49:26.333 --> 49:28.291
I... I hope I'm not interrupting.

49:28.833 --> 49:32.791
No. No, I'm just in project mode,
you know.

49:32.791 --> 49:35.083
I know, I'm excited. Um...

49:36.166 --> 49:37.375
- [sighs]
- Uh...

49:38.125 --> 49:40.541
Look, I'm shit at preambles.

49:40.541 --> 49:42.791
I made a life by getting to the point, so...

49:43.916 --> 49:45.041
I'll get to the point.

49:47.375 --> 49:48.416
I'm sorry.

49:50.041 --> 49:52.250
You and your brothers and your sisters,

49:52.250 --> 49:56.333
I always thought of you
as a pride of lions.

49:57.166 --> 50:00.458
And a young lioness
has to grapple with her...

50:01.083 --> 50:04.750
She has to grapple with her siblings
before she goes off to hunt, right?

50:04.750 --> 50:07.208
Just learn how to use her claws and...

50:08.166 --> 50:11.000
and her teeth and her strength,

50:11.000 --> 50:13.750
before she can go off
and slaughter the water buffalo.

50:16.083 --> 50:16.916
I...

50:18.375 --> 50:19.416
I want to apologize.

50:20.958 --> 50:23.041
For turning you kids against one another.

50:24.625 --> 50:27.833
I... I wanted to make you stronger.

50:29.250 --> 50:30.916
And I was...

50:33.083 --> 50:33.916
I was wrong.

50:36.333 --> 50:37.166
And...

50:40.541 --> 50:41.375
your work...

50:43.750 --> 50:46.333
Well, I may need your work
more than you know.

50:49.416 --> 50:50.625
I am not strong.

50:52.041 --> 50:52.875
I am...

50:55.916 --> 50:57.250
I am not brave.

50:59.083 --> 51:00.166
And your work...

51:01.333 --> 51:05.250
Well, it can make a big difference for me,

51:05.250 --> 51:10.125
so I am here to support you
with everything... everything I've got.

51:11.375 --> 51:12.666
It may even be a matter of...

51:12.666 --> 51:14.916
I'm sorry, can you just
turn the music off?

51:14.916 --> 51:17.500
I'm trying to... Trying to talk with you.

51:18.166 --> 51:20.083
Well, no, I'd very much rather not.

51:21.166 --> 51:22.583
Because, you see, there's a...

51:23.291 --> 51:24.208
There's a problem.

51:24.875 --> 51:26.833
Because if I turn it off...

51:26.833 --> 51:30.375
Look, I'll show you,
maybe you can... You can help me fix it.

51:31.666 --> 51:32.833
[music turns off]

51:32.833 --> 51:34.416
[mechanical chirping]

51:34.416 --> 51:35.333
[whispers] See?

51:38.041 --> 51:38.875
It's just...

51:40.333 --> 51:42.208
It's just... loud.

51:42.208 --> 51:44.166
I mean, do you... do you hear that?

51:44.791 --> 51:47.375
Because people keep telling me,
they can't hear it.

51:49.125 --> 51:50.291
Yeah, I can hear it.

51:50.291 --> 51:51.208
Right?

51:53.583 --> 51:57.500
And you were...
You were saying? About my work?

51:59.375 --> 52:00.750
What is that?

52:02.333 --> 52:04.791
Your support, it means so much to me.

52:05.583 --> 52:06.583
And I think...

52:08.000 --> 52:09.083
I think it works.

52:10.500 --> 52:11.791
Well, it does.

52:13.750 --> 52:14.583
It does work.

52:27.750 --> 52:30.875
- You're not going to tell anyone!
- Of course I'm going to tell.

52:30.875 --> 52:35.125
And I don't fucking care if you sue me
or you rip me apart!

52:35.791 --> 52:36.958
You Ushers...

52:38.250 --> 52:39.083
Fuck.

52:40.083 --> 52:41.916
I really didn't want to think it, but...

52:43.458 --> 52:45.375
you're all fucking monsters.

52:51.875 --> 52:52.708
[yells]

52:54.208 --> 52:56.291
Oh, God.

52:56.291 --> 52:57.333
Oh, God!

52:57.333 --> 52:59.166
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just...

52:59.166 --> 53:01.500
I just... I just wanted to hit the door.

53:01.500 --> 53:03.958
I just wanted to stop you.

53:03.958 --> 53:08.333
Look, babe, okay, wait, hang on.
Okay. Just hang on there.

53:10.083 --> 53:12.416
[panting]

53:12.416 --> 53:13.583
Okay.

53:17.750 --> 53:18.583
[gasps]

53:21.083 --> 53:22.041
[groaning]

53:23.708 --> 53:25.333
[man speaking indistinctly]

53:29.875 --> 53:31.708
[groaning]

53:33.208 --> 53:34.458
[knock on door]

53:35.541 --> 53:37.125
[man] Okay in there, Ms. Usher?

53:37.125 --> 53:39.416
[groaning]

53:39.416 --> 53:40.833
- Fuck off!
- [man] You okay?

53:41.541 --> 53:42.458
I heard noises.

53:43.166 --> 53:44.625
Just want to make sure everything...

53:45.083 --> 53:46.291
[hesitates]

53:46.291 --> 53:49.416
Have you never heard a woman
getting eaten out before?

53:49.416 --> 53:52.375
Fuck off you pervert or I'll replace you
with someone less cringe.

53:55.291 --> 53:56.625
[groaning]

53:56.625 --> 53:58.250
This was an accident.

54:00.833 --> 54:03.708
This was an accident, you hear me?

54:04.208 --> 54:06.958
I mean, you just...
You said you were going to tell, Al.

54:09.791 --> 54:11.291
You didn't mean that, did you?

54:12.041 --> 54:17.125
You believe me, right?
Yeah. Yeah. You believe me.

54:19.791 --> 54:20.625
No.

54:21.333 --> 54:24.458
No, no, no. Ali.

54:24.458 --> 54:26.958
Okay. I take it back, I take it back.

54:31.875 --> 54:33.541
[chirping]

54:34.208 --> 54:35.041
I forgot.

54:43.875 --> 54:45.625
What the fuck is that noise?

54:47.000 --> 54:48.208
And that smell?

55:01.916 --> 55:02.750
Dad!

55:04.375 --> 55:05.250
[Roderick] Yeah.

55:06.666 --> 55:07.666
I remember now!

55:19.791 --> 55:20.666
[gasps]

55:21.625 --> 55:22.458
There you are!

55:23.166 --> 55:25.625
So, I've been calling you
and calling you all...

55:26.958 --> 55:28.416
Don't take that tone with me.

55:30.208 --> 55:31.458
I'm sorry, Dad, she's...

55:32.291 --> 55:35.500
she's not being a team player,
but you see, it works.

55:39.333 --> 55:40.333
You're...

55:42.250 --> 55:43.333
You're fully funded.

55:44.583 --> 55:47.458
Let's just get out of here
and we'll get the paperwork started.

55:47.458 --> 55:48.375
No.

55:49.041 --> 55:51.083
No, not until she apologizes.

55:51.083 --> 55:53.875
Not until she promises
to be a team player.

55:53.875 --> 55:55.458
Well, she's... she's quite dead.

55:56.750 --> 55:57.583
Isn't she?

55:59.625 --> 56:01.666
Yes, that would explain it, wouldn't it?

56:02.500 --> 56:05.708
Like, why it's... it's making that sound.

56:06.708 --> 56:07.791
It's just pumping a...

56:11.875 --> 56:14.000
dead useless heart.

56:17.958 --> 56:21.166
Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry. I'm just...

56:24.208 --> 56:25.958
- I can fix it.
- No, no.

56:25.958 --> 56:27.125
Yeah, I can fix this.

56:27.125 --> 56:29.250
No, no, no-- Oh!

56:30.333 --> 56:32.416
You know, I wish you'd just jumped.

56:32.416 --> 56:36.291
Maybe then I wouldn't have to do this.

56:38.583 --> 56:39.458
Who am I kidding?

56:40.500 --> 56:41.333
'Course I would.

56:42.375 --> 56:43.958
Because the work is everything.

56:45.375 --> 56:48.541
Success is... Success is everything.

56:48.541 --> 56:51.875
- [sobs] No.
- And if we're going to succeed,

56:53.250 --> 56:55.708
we just need a better heart.

57:02.291 --> 57:03.791
No!

57:03.791 --> 57:05.583
[gasping]

57:08.416 --> 57:10.083
Oh. [gasps]

57:11.291 --> 57:12.125
Daddy?

57:13.500 --> 57:14.375
[gasps]

57:15.000 --> 57:16.333
[thuds]

57:28.625 --> 57:30.750
[chirping continues]
