WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:04.472
Previously on "The Rookie"...

00:04.505 --> 00:06.074
Any other plans?
I have to sell
our dad's house.

00:06.107 --> 00:07.541
We could make some money
if we put in a little effort.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.043
Chief of Police
gave me a Golden Ticket.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.378
I can pick any job I want.
What are you gonna pick?

00:10.411 --> 00:11.645
He's gonna pick
something lame.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.514
Training officer.
I knew it.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.216
Did I hear you're joining
the D.A.'s office?

00:15.249 --> 00:17.185
- Next week.
- Do you want to come in?

00:17.218 --> 00:20.421
I just wanted to make sure
someone checked on Lucy.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.022
He still has a pulse.
What have you done?

00:24.192 --> 00:26.394
Oh, don't trip
on the mat.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.028
Rosalind cut my wrists,
not my ankles.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.998
You just got out
of the hospital.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.367
How tragic would it be
if my chic, yet affordable

00:33.401 --> 00:35.836
welcome mat
sent you right back?

00:35.869 --> 00:37.238
You know you're cute
when you worry.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.606
I am cute always.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.208
That's true.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.576
Ooh.
New sofa.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.746
Yeah. You kind of ruined
the last one with all the--

00:45.779 --> 00:48.048
all the bleeding.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.450
Hey, it's okay.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.519
No, it's not.
It's what we make it.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.555
And I say, let's make the most
of your day off

00:54.588 --> 00:56.257
and cuddle up on the couch

00:56.290 --> 00:59.059
to binge the crap out of
something mindless.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.428
Deal?

01:00.461 --> 01:02.096
Deal.
All right.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.864
Knock knock. Hi.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.798
I'm looking for
Lucy Chen.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.034
Uh, yeah, that's me.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.369
Detective Misha Porter.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.204
I teach at the undercover
academy up in Sacramento.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.039
Yeah,
I know who you are.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.075
Well, I'm doing some recruiting,
and your name keeps coming up.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.910
You've worked several
impressive operations.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.680
Makes for an ideal candidate.
So I'm here to recruit you.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.417
Uh...

01:23.451 --> 01:24.785
When do classes start?

01:24.818 --> 01:27.121
Next Monday.
Sorry for the late notice.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.456
We had another candidate
fall out.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.258
But I'm positive your sergeant
will approve it.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.892
Yeah, he-- he would, for sure.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.794
It's just I have, um--

01:33.827 --> 01:35.829
I have some things going on
in my personal life right now,

01:35.863 --> 01:37.331
and--

01:37.365 --> 01:39.267
If it's not a good time,
I get it.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.336
But you should know

01:42.370 --> 01:44.071
my classes will open up
a ton of doors for you.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.439
No, I-I know.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.775
Detective Harper
has told me all about it.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.277
You'll have every major unit

01:49.310 --> 01:52.680
competing to poach you
from patrol.

01:54.148 --> 01:57.818
Um, this is amazing.
Thank you.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.454
I-I will definitely think
about this.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.790
Okay.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.658
Thank you.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.294
What are you doing?
Think about it?

02:06.327 --> 02:07.695
No. Go out there
and tell her yes.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.996
I can't.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.334
Baby, you almost died.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.869
But I didn't.
I'll-- I'll be fine.

02:15.903 --> 02:16.870
Chris...

02:16.904 --> 02:20.608
Lucy, I'll be fine.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.976
No.
I'm not leaving you.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.213
Undercover school can wait.

02:25.246 --> 02:28.549
So, what do you
want to binge?

02:31.652 --> 02:34.888
♪ Oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:34.922 --> 02:40.127
♪ I'm gonna win for you
like I know you want me to do ♪

02:40.160 --> 02:41.562
♪ Hey!

02:45.833 --> 02:48.569
We will talk about it
when we get home, okay?

02:49.937 --> 02:52.473
I can't do this right now.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.410
Because I can't.

02:56.444 --> 02:59.847
Look, we'll talk
when I get home.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.582
Everything okay?

03:01.615 --> 03:03.251
It's fine.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.885
Um, thanks for stopping by.
The Realtor just needs you to

03:04.918 --> 03:07.388
sign a couple of things
before the open house today.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.489
Absolutely.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.557
What do you think?

03:09.590 --> 03:11.225
Looks pretty good, right?

03:11.259 --> 03:12.426
Unrecognizable.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.561
The broker thinks
we're gonna have it sold

03:13.594 --> 03:14.695
by the end of the week.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.664
That's great.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.567
Once this place sells, we can
finally put it all behind us.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.737
Yeah. Yeah, it'll be nice.
Can move on.

03:25.473 --> 03:26.840
Don't.
Don't what?

03:26.874 --> 03:28.409
Have feelings?

03:28.442 --> 03:30.778
Don't get all misty-eyed
over Hill House.

03:30.811 --> 03:34.181
It's our childhood home.
Selling it means something.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.850
Hopefully it means
a half a million dollars each.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.587
I got to get to work.
Call me if you need anything.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.555
Will do.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.425
Sgt. Grey:
Now you're just showing off.

03:44.458 --> 03:48.262
A 98 on your
training officer exam.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.363
Pretty impressive.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.464
Thank you, sir.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.700
So next week, you're off
to F.T.O. School

03:52.733 --> 03:54.468
for post certification.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.537
And then, after that,

03:56.570 --> 03:59.239
you will officially be
a Field Training Officer.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.375
But until then,
I need someone

04:01.409 --> 04:03.411
to finish training
Officer Thorsen.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.713
You up
for a trial run?

04:05.746 --> 04:06.880
Is that allowed?

04:06.914 --> 04:08.549
It is if I say it is.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.284
Harper has got him
most of the way there.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.386
Only a few weeks
until he graduates.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.555
I'm happy to do it.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.257
And, sir, thank you for
all your help with this.

04:17.291 --> 04:20.461
Please.
You're helping me out.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.497
We've, um, come a long way,
haven't we, sir?

04:23.531 --> 04:24.732
Yeah.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.234
Or maybe it's about time
I start calling you Wade?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.936
Get out of my office,
Officer Nolan.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.170
Yes, sir.

04:30.203 --> 04:31.405
And close my door.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.506
Yes, sir.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.111
Good morning.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.414
Good morning,
Officer Nolan.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.282
I prepped the shop,
loaded the war bags,

04:42.316 --> 04:45.786
and I got you
this cup of coffee here.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.321
Harper trained you well.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.789
I mean,
if you want a challenge,

04:48.822 --> 04:51.859
I can be the, uh, worst rookie
you've ever come across.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.093
Just be yourself.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.662
Okay. I can do that.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.497
You know, typically, I like to
start my morning off with,

04:56.530 --> 04:58.366
you know, a little TikTok dance,
just to get, like,

04:58.399 --> 04:59.800
you know,
the hips warmed up.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.001
It kind of helps--

05:01.034 --> 05:03.003
A little less yourself.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.439
Copy that.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.975
Everything's controlled
through here and the app.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.977
Okay.
Looks simple enough.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.814
What was that?

05:13.847 --> 05:17.150
Uh, my wife's in pre-labor.
And we're having a home birth.

05:18.352 --> 05:21.021
And you just moved?

05:21.054 --> 05:23.457
Well, the plan was to wait until
after the baby,

05:23.491 --> 05:25.726
but then the nesting
hormones took over,

05:25.759 --> 05:28.529
and the next thing I knew,
we were in escrow.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.297
But I'm all over it.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.233
I feel like I've trained
my whole life for this moment.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.334
Cool.

05:36.704 --> 05:40.040
All right. Assure Home Security
system is live.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.175
Sensors on every door
and window.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.311
Just need to put the app
on your phone.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.213
I forgot
they were even coming today.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.848
Oh, you got a lot
on your plate.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.349
Just concentrate
on giving birth.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.551
I've got the rest.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.685
You know, when you said

05:51.719 --> 05:53.320
you were gonna be
a good labor assistant,

05:53.353 --> 05:55.155
I thought it was just one
of those things that men say

05:55.188 --> 05:56.356
when they act like
they know something

05:56.390 --> 05:57.558
but they really don't.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.727
Well, this is actually
my third rodeo.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.730
My ex had zero trust
in the medical system,

06:02.763 --> 06:04.598
so both boys
were born at home.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.866
You know, in a way,

06:05.899 --> 06:07.868
I've actually got
more childbirth experience

06:07.901 --> 06:09.236
than you do.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.672
Thank God.
'Cause after last time,

06:11.705 --> 06:14.875
I cannot imagine giving birth
in a hospital again.

06:14.908 --> 06:18.178
Well, this birth
will be different.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.381
The placenta is completely clear
of the baby's pathway.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.383
Your OB-GYN signed off.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.519
We got the midwife
on speed dial,

06:25.553 --> 06:28.589
and if anything goes wrong,
hospital is four minutes away.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.858
But just FYI, I can get us to
the hospital in two minutes

06:30.891 --> 06:33.093
because I know a shortcut.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.629
Uh, I don't think a sidewalk
is considered a short cut.

06:35.663 --> 06:38.065
Mm-hmm. Mm, mm!

06:38.098 --> 06:39.299
Contractions?

06:39.332 --> 06:42.703
Mm-hmm.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.704
Tell me we got this.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.706
We got this.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.375
Okay. Mm.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.313
What was the color of the truck
three cars back?

06:53.346 --> 06:55.215
Red.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.384
How many sex workers
have we passed?
Four.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.086
What are the crime stats
for this area?

06:59.119 --> 07:00.454
In this last week?
Yes.

07:00.488 --> 07:03.491
Um,
three motor vehicle thefts.

07:03.524 --> 07:07.461
Two burglaries.
And seven thefts from vehicles.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.563
All right. Here's something
you won't know--

07:09.597 --> 07:12.332
What is the best sealant to use
when joining plastic to tile?

07:14.001 --> 07:16.103
I mean, there's a lot
of great options,

07:16.136 --> 07:19.940
but probably something
silicone-based would work best.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.975
How did you know that?

07:22.009 --> 07:24.077
You told me that yesterday.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.613
Right.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.914
<i>7-Adam-15,</i>

07:26.947 --> 07:28.281
<i>I have a call for
a welfare check</i>

07:28.315 --> 07:30.618
<i>at 707 Palm Street.</i>

07:30.651 --> 07:31.485
Show us responding.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.961
Police.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.997
Hey, Nolan.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.434
Hold your breath.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.813
He's gone.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.619
And he's a cop.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.287
Welcome to
the D.A.'s office.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.222
Thanks.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.824
I'm not gonna lie.
It's weird to be working here.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.359
Yeah, I'll bet.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.127
Uh, break room's
around that corner over there,

08:14.161 --> 08:15.996
where you'll find
every old-school snack

08:16.029 --> 08:17.865
you didn't think
they still made anymore.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.701
Because they don't.
They're just old.

08:20.734 --> 08:21.569
Seriously.
Don't eat them.

08:21.602 --> 08:22.903
Good to know.

08:22.936 --> 08:26.073
And this is
your office.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.908
And these are
your case files.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.077
That is a lot.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.245
Well, we like to keep up
a brisk pace.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.147
You spend too much time
in any one case,

08:34.181 --> 08:35.182
and the backlog
will kill you.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.385
Hmm. Well, the good news is,
at least,

08:38.418 --> 08:40.420
this one doesn't seem
worth pursuing.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.422
Find the ones that are,
kick the rest.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.325
Prosecutorial discretion
is a beautiful thing.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.227
Have fun.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.096
Yeah.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.269
Thanks.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.771
He one of ours?

08:57.805 --> 08:59.873
Sheriff's Deputy.
His name's Garrett Patel.

08:59.907 --> 09:03.110
He was dead when we arrived.
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.344
Let's make sure
we honor him

09:04.377 --> 09:06.113
and not let anything
slip through the cracks.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.581
Right.
Where's your rookie?

09:07.615 --> 09:09.850
Uh, inside with T.I.D.
At this point in his training,

09:09.883 --> 09:11.218
I thought it'd be valuable
for him to

09:11.251 --> 09:12.452
process a crime scene
with them.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.355
Smart. All right,
I'll keep an eye on him,

09:15.388 --> 09:16.890
and you go to the morgue
with our victim.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.359
Dr. Roberts has agreed
to do a rush preliminary exam.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.261
All right. I'll swing by
afterwards, pick up Aaron.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.763
Thanks.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.638
So, this is the <i>rebozo</i>
lift and sift technique,

09:30.671 --> 09:32.305
helps pull the weight
off the lower back.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.207
Mm. Feels amazing.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.877
It can really help once the
contractions get more intense.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.148
What is that?

09:41.181 --> 09:44.084
It's death metal. No--
thrash metal. Thrash metal.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.753
Mnh-mnh, no,
not at my home birth.

09:45.786 --> 09:46.987
Help me up.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.088
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.157
You relax.
Stay here.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.425
I'll go talk to them.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.267
Neighbor.
What do you want?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.736
W-We just moved in
across the street.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.272
My-- My wife and I
are having a baby, a home birth.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.307
She just started
having contractions.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.010
Uh, this music is not
on our labor playlist,

10:10.043 --> 10:11.311
if you know what I mean.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.580
Um, can you turn it down?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.282
No.

10:21.554 --> 10:24.291
Okay, Nyla-- Nyla, you don't
want to stress the baby.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.759
I-I'm sure they'll turn it off
at some point.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.360
Move.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.834
Turn the music down.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.068
Now.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.505
Yo, turn it down.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.012
Thank you so much.

10:48.882 --> 10:52.152
All I'll say is,
I'm glad you're on my side.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.453
You found something already?

10:53.486 --> 10:54.521
Possibly.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.623
I haven't done
the full autopsy yet,

10:56.656 --> 11:00.127
but I found something concerning
on the external exam.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.462
Several patches
of missing chest hair.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.897
All around
the same position.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.532
Like it was pulled out. Right.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.234
And I found some
adhesive residue

11:07.267 --> 11:09.036
on the surrounding hair
and skin.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.505
Tape.
So maybe he was wearing a wire?

11:12.539 --> 11:13.707
Doing undercover work?

11:13.741 --> 11:15.042
One other thing.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.543
All right.
What am I looking at here?

11:16.576 --> 11:19.312
I found these fibers
on his wrists.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.015
I believe they're from
soft wrist restraints,

11:22.049 --> 11:24.084
the kind that don't
leave marks.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.319
Well, we didn't find anything
like that in the car,

11:26.353 --> 11:28.889
which would suggest
he was restrained long enough

11:28.922 --> 11:30.690
for the carbon monoxide
to do its job,

11:30.724 --> 11:32.993
and then the restraints
were removed,

11:33.026 --> 11:34.227
making it look
like a suicide.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.496
But why would someone
go to so much trouble

11:36.529 --> 11:39.699
to murder
a Sheriff's Deputy?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.704
Undercover school
sounds amazing.

11:44.738 --> 11:45.939
"Self-surgery."

11:45.973 --> 11:47.707
"Six things to say
when your cover's blown."

11:47.741 --> 11:50.343
"When your
informant is a double agent."

11:50.377 --> 11:52.345
Yeah, you have to go.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.781
This is where
I want to be.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.116
Lucy, if you're staying here
out of guilt, don't.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.419
This wasn't your fault.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.221
Of course it was my fault.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.690
Rosalind targeted you
because of me.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.725
She's angry that
I didn't testify.

12:05.759 --> 12:06.860
You don't know that.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.728
Yes, I do.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.764
I moved on.
She couldn't handle that.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.233
She'd been looking forward to
torturing me on the stand.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.903
And when I took that
away from her, she--

12:15.936 --> 12:17.737
she tried to take you.

12:17.771 --> 12:18.772
But she didn't.

12:18.806 --> 12:19.807
Chris--

12:19.840 --> 12:22.943
No.

12:22.976 --> 12:26.479
Listen, if you skip U.C. school
because of this,

12:26.513 --> 12:28.315
that's something
she <i>wi</i> be taking from you.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.587
Hey.
Garrett Patel was assigned

12:34.621 --> 12:37.124
to a special narcotics unit
in the Sheriff's Department.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.491
Word is they run
mostly reversals.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.160
Which means?

12:40.193 --> 12:41.795
Which means
law enforcement officers

12:41.829 --> 12:43.463
pose as drug sellers.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.165
They flash real dope
to lure the buyers.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.800
And then, when the money
is exchanged,

12:46.834 --> 12:48.435
they make the arrest. Nice.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.469
You think Garrett
was wearing a wire

12:49.502 --> 12:50.637
as part of
an investigation?

12:50.670 --> 12:52.772
Maybe. But it doesn't
explain his murder.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.308
A staged suicide isn't exactly
a drug dealer's go-to.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.576
They're a lot less subtle.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.978
So what's next?
We reach out to his unit?

12:58.011 --> 12:59.579
Garrett's ex-wife
just landed.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.481
I'll talk to her first.
See if she has any insight.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.150
Right.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.653
We got divorced,
uh, five months ago,

13:06.686 --> 13:07.855
but we still talked.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.322
About work?

13:09.356 --> 13:12.159
A little.
Garrett seemed really stressed.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.595
And of course
he wouldn't tell me why.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.665
Part of the reason why we split
was because it was clear

13:18.698 --> 13:20.333
that he was keeping
things from me.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.204
And it got really bad
at the end.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.508
His narcotics buddies
would come over to play poker,

13:28.541 --> 13:31.144
and the second I walked in
the room, they would get quiet.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.712
Can I get their names?

13:32.745 --> 13:34.714
Yeah, it's,
uh, Walt Lindbeck.

13:34.747 --> 13:35.983
He's the team leader.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.986
Super cocky.
Thinks he's God's gift.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.989
Um, Simon Ayer.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.957
He's a sweet guy.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.292
He's young, like Garrett.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.895
But Rick Croyer--

13:47.928 --> 13:50.497
he just gave me
a bad feeling.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.399
Look, don't get me wrong.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.067
We had other problems
with our marriage.

13:54.101 --> 13:58.138
But when Garrett started
hanging with "The Crew," that--

13:58.171 --> 14:00.373
that was the beginning
of the end.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.508
Wait.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.911
They call themselves
"The Crew"?

14:03.944 --> 14:05.245
When will cops learn?

14:05.278 --> 14:07.147
Learn what?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.016
Look, you can hang out
with other cops all you want,

14:09.049 --> 14:10.850
but the second
you give your group a name,

14:10.884 --> 14:12.819
it's just a matter of time
until you're under indictment.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.854
Really?
Does that work for any name?

14:14.888 --> 14:16.890
What if you call yourselves
"The Snuggle Bunch"?

14:16.924 --> 14:18.425
You're going to prison. Totally.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.193
I can't explain it,
but it never fails.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.095
Give yourself a name,
go to jail.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.496
Noted.
But I think the judge

14:23.530 --> 14:24.932
is gonna want
a little more than that.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.533
So how are we going after
these guys?

14:28.268 --> 14:30.737
You're kidding.
10 offers already?

14:30.770 --> 14:32.072
That's incredible.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.407
I know.
I'm a little in shock.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.775
<i>So, what's
the highest offer?</i>

14:35.808 --> 14:37.377
$50,000 over asking.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.511
From a developer.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.380
<i>But there's also
this family.</i>

14:40.413 --> 14:42.682
The dad included the most
touching letter with the offer,

14:42.715 --> 14:44.184
<i>all about how much
it would mean to his kids</i>

14:44.217 --> 14:45.718
<i>to finally have a home.</i>

14:45.752 --> 14:46.553
Okay, so,
what's their offer?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.088
Asking.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.522
So $50,000 less.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.358
It's still more than
we expected to get.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.093
Besides, the developer
will just tear it down.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.594
Good. House is
an actual crime scene.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.795
It should be torn down.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.464
Listen, Genny,
I got to go.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.399
Keep me posted.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.469
Hey.
Uh, I'll do a number three.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.304
Coming right up.
Thank you.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.738
We got a number three.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.542
What's up, gentlemen?
Hey.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.145
You guys, uh, work with that
deputy that killed himself?

15:12.179 --> 15:13.546
We did, actually.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.248
Sorry for your loss.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.217
Tim Bradford,
Mid-Wilshire Division.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.418
My guys found the body.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.420
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, it's always tough

15:20.453 --> 15:22.455
to lose someone
you were in the trenches with.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.557
I just wish we had realized
how much he'd been hurting.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.493
It's got to be rough.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.328
Well, look, if you guys
need anything...

15:28.361 --> 15:29.496
Thanks.
Yeah.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.598
Actually, uh...

15:31.631 --> 15:32.799
you know,
we've been hearing some rumors

15:32.832 --> 15:35.168
about foul play.
Yeah?

15:35.202 --> 15:37.137
Hadn't heard that.
I can check, though.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.671
You guys
working on something

15:38.705 --> 15:40.240
that could have
come back on him?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.508
Eh, that's tough to say.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.942
We put away a lot
of bad hombres,

15:42.976 --> 15:44.744
but nobody immediately
springs to mind.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.913
Well,
I'll tell you this,

15:46.946 --> 15:50.183
if someone did
kill Garrett,

15:50.217 --> 15:52.619
they're not gonna survive
that trip to lockup.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.088
I can do some digging
and get back to you.

15:56.656 --> 15:57.690
Sergeant Lindbeck.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.659
It's Walt.
Much appreciated.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.128
Yeah. Least I could do.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.962
Cops got to stick together, right?

16:02.996 --> 16:04.364
Damn right.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.334
Take care.
You too.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.601
Those aren't grieving faces.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.270
Those are guys terrified
of getting caught.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.005
Great.
Where's my burrito?

16:12.039 --> 16:14.607
Sorry. I got distracted trying
to gaslight crooked cops.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.942
Crooked how?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.444
They're running reversals,
right?
Mm-hmm.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.945
So instead of
arresting the dealers,

16:18.978 --> 16:20.447
they're taking the cash
and cutting them free.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.949
With their intel, they would
know exactly who to target.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.684
And with their access
to real drugs,

16:24.717 --> 16:26.719
they could make sales
seem legit.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.356
And it's not like the dealers
can call the cops to complain.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.623
I'll read Wesley in.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.292
I need you guys
to hit up your CIs.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.327
If The Crew
are ripping off dealers,

16:34.361 --> 16:35.962
there's gonna be a lot of
pissed-off criminals out there.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.564
Someone's heard something.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.899
You know, Harper has got
the best CIs in the station.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.734
You're right.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.071
Nolan, call Harper.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.406
She likes you best.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.507
Really?

16:47.540 --> 16:48.575
Mm-hmm.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.910
On it.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.879
That was a dirty lie.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.214
Today is her due date.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.882
Do you want to be the one
calling her about work?

16:55.915 --> 16:58.551
You're an evil genius.
Emphasis on the "evil."

16:58.585 --> 17:00.687
Damn straight.
Now give me half that burrito

17:00.720 --> 17:03.022
before I turn my evil
against you.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.828
So, how's Lucy?

17:08.861 --> 17:11.198
Uh, you know,
she's still a little shaken.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.433
Taking some time
to get Chris settled.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.768
Remind me what you were doing
at her apartment

17:15.802 --> 17:18.605
when you found Chris
bleeding out?

17:18.638 --> 17:21.541
Just... dropping her off
after we got back from Vegas.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.110
Mm-hmm.

17:24.877 --> 17:25.978
What are you implying?

17:27.380 --> 17:28.215
What do you think?

17:30.817 --> 17:32.285
I was just dropping her off.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.553
Mm-hmm.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.395
You don't have to
answer that.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.431
Nolan,
has someone been shot?

17:44.464 --> 17:46.133
No.
<i>Did someone catch
Rosalind Dyer?</i>

17:46.166 --> 17:47.800
No.
Okay, then I'm hanging up.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.136
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

17:49.169 --> 17:50.036
There's a corrupt group
of deputies.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.571
They killed
one of their own.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.273
All right, talk fast.
The whole point of a home birth

17:53.306 --> 17:55.742
is to be left alone
to suffer in peace.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.410
You're in labor?
Like right now?

17:57.444 --> 17:59.479
Nolan, fast.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.214
Uh, we think
they're ripping off dealers.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.315
We need your best CI.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.284
Uh, okay. Abel Lawton.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.253
I will text you
his phone number.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.887
Thank you. Good--

18:07.920 --> 18:09.589
Good luck.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.595
Hey. You still wading through
those case files?

18:15.628 --> 18:16.663
No, I'm done.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.064
You read them all,

18:18.097 --> 18:19.432
or you just skimmed them
for the headlines?

18:19.466 --> 18:21.801
Well,
I got the gist. Ah.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.570
Jonathan, 19-year-old kid
arrested a year ago

18:23.603 --> 18:25.004
on a gun charge.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.573
Since then,
he's got his act together.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.141
Taking trade school classes.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.977
He's about to be credentialed
as a specialized pipefitter.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.512
I'm gonna knock that one
down to a misdemeanor.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.080
You're knocking down charges

18:34.113 --> 18:35.482
while violent crime
is on the rise?

18:37.184 --> 18:38.685
I don't think that
he's a violent criminal.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.453
Huh.
I think he carried a gun
for protection

18:40.487 --> 18:42.255
in a neighborhood
where that makes sense.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.290
I could run you down
my whole list,

18:43.323 --> 18:44.691
but that would take a while.
No, no.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.526
Just tell me how many cases
you're gonna plead out

18:46.559 --> 18:48.161
and how many cases
you're taking to trial,

18:48.195 --> 18:50.297
keeping in mind
the correct ratio

18:50.330 --> 18:52.432
is nine plea bargains
for every trial.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.367
Zero. And zero.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.603
Well,
that's not an option.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.805
I'm just exercising
my prosecutorial discretion.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.973
Ha ha ha. Look.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.975
Pick a case to charge,
any case,

19:03.009 --> 19:04.844
by the end of the day, okay?

19:04.877 --> 19:07.414
We didn't hire you so you can
give everyone a free pass.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.657
Hey.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.359
<i>Hey. Got some time?</i>

19:19.392 --> 19:21.461
We have a case.
It's gonna be tricky.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.829
Does it involve
punishing the poor?

19:22.862 --> 19:25.232
<i>No. Dirty cops.</i>

19:25.265 --> 19:27.133
I'll be right there.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.541
You think it's too early
to get in the pool?

19:34.574 --> 19:36.042
No.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.044
Warm water
could help you relax

19:38.077 --> 19:40.413
and relieve
some of your back pain.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.148
What is that lovely smell?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.384
Mm.
I rubbed the lavender oil

19:44.417 --> 19:48.087
onto my skin
so that my scent could calm you.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.922
You really do
think of everything.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.391
Mm-hmm.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.425
You were cool with it
in the beginning.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.195
Is that the neighbors again?
I'm going over there.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.365
Mnh-mnh.
No, no, no, no, you're not.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.700
Just call in
a noise complaint.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.936
Uh, fireworks?

20:03.970 --> 20:06.239
No, that was gunshots.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.010
Officer Nyla Harper.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.281
Shots fired
near 5575 Orange Grove.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.719
Well, looks like
a false alarm.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.688
Didn't sound false.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.090
Your neighbors said they were
watching "Dirty Harry."

20:24.123 --> 20:25.458
That's got to be
what you heard.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.794
Smitty, I am telling you,
I heard live gunshots.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.095
We did a thorough search
of the house.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.464
There was no sign
of foul play.

20:31.498 --> 20:34.133
And the only guns
that I saw...

20:34.166 --> 20:35.435
were on that homey's arms.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.737
That dude is ripped.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.071
Thank you, Smitty.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.274
You are as much help
as I thought you would be.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.575
You need a hand
with anything else?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.644
No, thank you. Goodbye.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.152
Maybe it was "Dirty Harry."

20:53.185 --> 20:55.655
I mean, they've got a serious
sound system in there.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.324
Those shots were from
a high-caliber weapon,

20:57.357 --> 21:00.493
not a 40-year-old handgun.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.829
It was a big gun.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.766
Just saying.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.101
Mr. Lawton,
thank you for coming in.

21:09.135 --> 21:11.103
<i>Yeah.
Uh, can you make it quick?</i>

21:11.137 --> 21:12.572
<i>I-I-I don't like
being here.</i>

21:12.605 --> 21:13.940
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.274
You know, we could have
come to your place,

21:15.308 --> 21:16.509
but that might have
jammed you up.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.277
Okay, spare me the attitude,
all right?

21:18.311 --> 21:20.480
You guys clearly need
something from me.

21:20.513 --> 21:21.914
And I should warn you,
all right,

21:21.948 --> 21:24.417
my rates have gone up
substantially since,

21:24.451 --> 21:27.253
you know, I've been
selling intel to the Feds--

21:27.286 --> 21:29.422
Yes, Harper did
warn us about that.

21:29.456 --> 21:32.859
She told us to tell you,
"Remember Oceanside."

21:37.196 --> 21:39.499
Okay. Uh...

21:39.532 --> 21:42.335
On second thought, um--

21:42.369 --> 21:44.203
uh, for a friend of Harper's,
it's free.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.339
Uh, what do you-- what--
what do you need?

21:46.373 --> 21:48.207
What do you know about anyone
ripping off drug dealers?

21:49.542 --> 21:51.511
You mean those
Sheriff's Department guys?

21:51.544 --> 21:53.813
Uh, yeah.

21:53.846 --> 21:57.550
They hit up my boy, Junior,
for like 100K.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.285
Okay, well, uh,
we need to talk to him.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.453
So where is he?

22:00.487 --> 22:01.888
He's in lockup.

22:01.921 --> 22:05.525
Or... at least he was.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.960
He's in the morgue now.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.697
Got shanked in prison
like two hours ago.

22:12.064 --> 22:14.401
They gave themselves a name.
When are cops gonna learn?

22:14.434 --> 22:15.668
Clearly never.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.570
And so far,
evidence is sketchy at best.

22:17.604 --> 22:18.805
We think our victim
was recording

22:18.838 --> 22:20.139
their criminal activity,

22:20.172 --> 22:21.474
but we can't
find the recordings.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.242
And we had
a potential witness,

22:23.275 --> 22:25.412
but he magically got shanked
in prison earlier today.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.713
All right.
So what about financial records?

22:26.746 --> 22:27.914
If they're stealing
from drug dealers,

22:27.947 --> 22:29.148
where is the money going?

22:29.181 --> 22:30.383
Nowhere we can find.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.818
Clearly, they're being
very disciplined

22:31.851 --> 22:32.919
with the cash
they're stealing.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.186
Then you need
the recordings.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.855
Without them,
there's no case.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.524
I know.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.027
Hi.
Lucy.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.362
Uh,
were we expecting you?

22:43.396 --> 22:46.165
Oh, no. But I-I heard
today was the big day,

22:46.198 --> 22:49.035
so I brought you some food
so you didn't have to go out.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.870
That is
very sweet of you.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.072
Uh, Nyla, Lucy's here.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.074
So, it's totally vegetarian.
Ashwagandha--

22:55.107 --> 22:57.710
Oh, my God!
You are glowing.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.546
I am not,
but thank you.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.580
And thank you
for the food.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.682
Mm-hmm.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.283
So, hey, while I'm here,

23:04.316 --> 23:05.752
I wanted to
run something by you.

23:05.785 --> 23:08.855
Um, I was offered a spot
in U.C. school.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.524
That's great. That's g--
You-- You deserve it.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.092
Um, quick question.
- Mm.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.794
What do you think about that
house across the street?

23:14.827 --> 23:17.430
Oh, I-I didn't
really notice it.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.732
So, the thing is, Chris just got
out of the hospital,

23:19.766 --> 23:21.233
and he really
needs me to help him.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.035
Okay, so, James thinks
that I should drop it,

23:23.069 --> 23:25.137
but something is going on
over at that house.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.707
I heard gunshots earlier on.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.809
And they sent Smitty.
But I know Smitty is--

23:29.842 --> 23:32.211
Nyla Harper.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.412
Yes.

23:33.446 --> 23:35.915
Are you roping Lucy
into your fantasy?

23:35.948 --> 23:37.249
It's not a fantasy.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.486
O-Okay.
I didn't mean it like that.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.754
I apologize.
But the truth is,

23:41.788 --> 23:45.992
labor induces a tidal wave
of physiological changes.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.594
Hormone levels spike,

23:47.627 --> 23:51.397
neurotransmitters jack up a kind
of fight-or-flight response.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.666
Okay, is this just
your way of saying

23:53.700 --> 23:54.701
that it's all in my head?

23:55.968 --> 23:57.770
No.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.806
All I'm saying is
you're about to give birth,

23:59.839 --> 24:01.440
and you're hypersensitive

24:01.474 --> 24:03.476
to anything that might
seem like a threat.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.912
Yeah.
That seems logical.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.780
Okay, uh, you know what?
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.683
Um, should I say yes?

24:10.717 --> 24:11.984
To what?

24:12.018 --> 24:13.352
To U.C. school?

24:13.385 --> 24:14.854
Yes.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.088
Say yes.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.323
Oh...

24:18.558 --> 24:20.893
I swear it'd be quieter
at a hospital.

24:49.589 --> 24:52.191
Police!
Show yourself right now.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.296
I don't want to hear it.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.865
You broke the seal.
You're in my crime scene.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.667
It was our guy
who went down.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.134
You think we're just gonna
stand on the sidelines,

25:02.168 --> 25:03.836
watch the LAPD
screw up the investigation?

25:03.870 --> 25:05.337
You buying this?
No.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.139
Listen,
we're all on the same team--

25:07.173 --> 25:09.008
Wrong.
We're investigating a homicide,

25:09.041 --> 25:12.511
and you appear to be attempting
to obstruct that investigation.

25:12.545 --> 25:13.746
You don't know what
you're talking about, honey.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.147
Come on, let's go.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.583
We got a warrant
to search everything, Walt,

25:16.616 --> 25:17.884
including you.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.385
That's not happening.

25:19.418 --> 25:20.653
You don't want to
walk into this.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.589
Try me.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.557
Aah!

25:24.591 --> 25:25.792
Don't.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.662
Get up. Get up.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.163
Come on.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.566
Hands behind your back.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.277
Shipping receipt
with Garrett's name on it.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.013
A million bucks
it's a recording

25:47.046 --> 25:49.048
from the wire
Garrett was wearing.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.549
You're under arrest, gentlemen,

25:50.583 --> 25:52.284
for removing evidence
and obstruction.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.453
Turn around.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.088
Where's your buddy Rick?

25:58.457 --> 26:00.426
How about you?
You can help yourself here.

26:00.459 --> 26:02.528
Don't say a word.
Don't listen to him.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.763
Where's Rick?

26:06.899 --> 26:09.301
You know, you'd think
cops would be smarter.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.838
This warrant
covers your phone.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.645
Called Rick right before
we came in.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.117
Hello.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.619
<i>Hey.
Tim and I found The Crew</i>

26:26.653 --> 26:28.487
<i>at Garrett's house doing
some evidence tampering.</i>

26:28.520 --> 26:30.589
We think Garrett mailed
the recordings to himself

26:30.623 --> 26:32.258
at Coast to Post
Mailbox Service,

26:32.291 --> 26:33.626
7646 West Vernon.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.094
We're on it.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.096
Move your ass.
Rick's already on his way there.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.998
If he gets there first,
he'll destroy the evidence.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.466
Hit it.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.138
Is it okay
if I take a quick shower?

26:46.172 --> 26:47.606
Yep.
You sure?

26:47.640 --> 26:48.675
Yep.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.009
Okay.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.366
"Dirty Harry" my ass.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.519
You left the trunk open.

28:07.553 --> 28:09.889
No, I didn't.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.910
Hey, neighbor!
Hey, hey!

28:30.943 --> 28:32.845
How you doing?

28:32.879 --> 28:34.013
Sorry to bother you.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.114
Oh.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.249
Our cat ran out,
um, and she--

28:37.283 --> 28:39.718
she's a-a total troublemaker,

28:39.752 --> 28:41.353
um, but she's been declawed

28:41.387 --> 28:43.289
so it's not safe for her
to be wandering around out here.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.024
You haven't seen her,
have you?

28:45.057 --> 28:46.225
No.

28:46.258 --> 28:49.228
No. Okay. Uh, damn.

28:49.261 --> 28:52.531
Well, please let me know
if you do.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.133
Thank you.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.004
Thanks again.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.089
Okay, what the hell
were you doing over there?

29:17.123 --> 29:18.157
Gathering evidence.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.758
Without a warrant?

29:19.792 --> 29:21.727
Don't lecture me.
My water just broke.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.129
The law still applies.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.597
Wait-- W-W-What, what?

29:25.631 --> 29:27.066
Mm-hmm.
Oh, come on, come on.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.167
We got to get you
in the birthing tub,

29:28.200 --> 29:29.368
and I got to call the midwife.
Come on.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.743
All right.
You go around front.

29:37.776 --> 29:38.510
I'll scope it out inside.

29:38.544 --> 29:39.846
Copy that.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.696
Hey!
Hey, you guys need to move.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.272
Give me the package.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.340
I-I'm looking.
Please don't point that at me.

30:08.374 --> 30:09.341
Hurry up!

30:09.375 --> 30:11.077
O-Okay. Okay.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.046
Give it up, Rick.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.647
Walt and Simon
are already in custody.

30:15.681 --> 30:17.383
You're just making things worse
for yourself.

30:29.495 --> 30:30.662
Stay here, all right?

30:38.370 --> 30:39.805
Get down!

30:39.838 --> 30:40.672
Give me your hands.

30:40.706 --> 30:41.908
Both of them. Come on.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.016
You broke my ribs.

30:50.049 --> 30:53.252
You killed a cop.
You're under arrest.

30:56.755 --> 30:58.324
Where you been?

31:06.899 --> 31:08.000
Nyla,
you have the baby yet?

31:10.202 --> 31:12.238
Hey, Nyla.

31:12.271 --> 31:13.872
<i>Aah. I need you to
look into my neighbors.</i>

31:13.906 --> 31:15.908
Um, I heard gunshots,

31:15.942 --> 31:17.443
and I-I think
that there's something

31:17.476 --> 31:20.112
going [groaning] on
over there.

31:20.146 --> 31:24.951
It's, uh,
5574 Orange Grove.

31:24.984 --> 31:27.553
You literally sound like
you're having a baby right now.

31:27.586 --> 31:28.854
Mm, basically.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.757
And these guys, they are
messing with my birth plan.

31:31.790 --> 31:35.261
Oh, oh. Okay.

31:35.294 --> 31:38.897
Uh, I saw them moving
what could have been a body

31:38.931 --> 31:40.366
<i>into the trunk
of their car.</i>

31:40.399 --> 31:43.970
And I found hydrofluoric acid
in there as well.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.705
But I-I saw all of this
without a warrant.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.408
I'll run the homeowner
and any associates.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.278
But I need you to focus on
having the baby.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.713
If I find anything,
I'll get in touch.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.983
Okay, okay. Thank you.

31:57.016 --> 32:00.119
Um, did I hear you
talking to somebody?

32:00.152 --> 32:01.253
Nope.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.789
Ooh.

32:03.822 --> 32:06.225
Ooh, ice chips.
Thank you. Yes.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.261
Oh, oh!

32:10.329 --> 32:12.431
Doesn't feel good to be on that
side of the table, does it?

32:12.464 --> 32:14.333
No.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.668
Prison's gonna feel
even worse.

32:16.702 --> 32:19.438
And before you give me your song
and dance about your innocence,

32:19.471 --> 32:22.174
you should know
Garrett wore a wire for months.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.643
There are dozens of hours
of recordings.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.345
You want a sample?

32:26.378 --> 32:27.746
<i>It's zero eight hundred.</i>

32:27.779 --> 32:29.615
<i>We're about to meet a buyer,
Junior Mills.</i>

32:29.648 --> 32:31.450
<i>Hey, where you been?
Let's go.</i>

32:31.483 --> 32:33.785
<i>Sorry, Walt.
Just getting my head right.</i>

32:33.819 --> 32:36.255
<i>Simon, what's up?</i>

32:37.990 --> 32:41.293
See how Garrett name checks
you and Walt? Smart.

32:41.327 --> 32:44.163
<i>Well, let's get in there.
It's payday.</i>

32:44.196 --> 32:45.664
<i>You know how this works, Junior.</i>

32:45.697 --> 32:47.766
<i>We let you get a taste,
now show us the money.</i>

32:47.799 --> 32:48.834
<i>It's all there.</i>

32:48.867 --> 32:50.602
<i>Great. Now beat it.</i>

32:50.636 --> 32:51.670
<i>You got to be kidding me.</i>

32:51.703 --> 32:53.005
<i>You got five
to start walking</i>

32:53.039 --> 32:54.006
<i>and if we see you again--</i>

32:54.040 --> 32:56.308
Yeah, there it is.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.044
Your crew stealing from
the drug dealers

32:58.077 --> 32:59.511
you're supposed to arrest.

32:59.545 --> 33:02.148
Most of them slink away,
but Junior talked.

33:02.181 --> 33:05.051
Told anyone he could
about the crew who robbed him.

33:05.084 --> 33:07.053
And Junior
ended up dead.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.155
I don't know anything
about that.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.389
You got one chance
to come clean.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.557
Tell us everything you know,

33:11.590 --> 33:13.225
and I'm prepared to
offer you leniency.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.127
Walt will kill me.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.729
He won't be able to get
anywhere near you.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.165
I promise.

33:19.198 --> 33:21.567
It's time to do
the right thing

33:21.600 --> 33:22.568
for Garrett.

33:27.939 --> 33:29.341
Where is the midwife?

33:29.375 --> 33:31.343
She's on her way.
There's traffic.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.912
Remember, don't scream.
It's-- It's just wasted energy.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.147
Channel it into breathing.

33:35.181 --> 33:37.716
Aah!
Come on.

33:37.749 --> 33:40.186
Okay, yeah, that's fine, too.
That's fine, too.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.920
Come on. Here you go.

33:41.953 --> 33:44.022
Mm.

33:44.056 --> 33:46.058
I thought you said the second
one was always easier.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.693
I said usually.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.328
Maybe the third will be
the easy one, hmm?

33:50.562 --> 33:51.563
Sorry.
That was too soon, too soon.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.235
Let me guess, that's the midwife
saying she can't make it.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.837
No, it's the Assure
Home Security app.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.541
The security system has detected
an open window downstairs.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.244
Someone's in the house.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.213
Not necessarily--

34:09.648 --> 34:11.583
Get my gun.

34:11.617 --> 34:13.785
Okay, Nyla,
you are fully dilated.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.454
This baby is coming
any minute now.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.955
It's the murderers
from across the street.

34:16.988 --> 34:18.290
Get my damn gun.

34:22.428 --> 34:25.131
Okay, you stay here, okay?

34:25.164 --> 34:27.099
I'll go check it out.
Stay here.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.135
What? No-- James, stay--
No. James, you...

36:51.710 --> 36:54.179
Drop the gun.
I am in here giving life,

36:54.212 --> 36:57.583
but I will take yours
if you even twitch.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.296
7-Adam-200, shots fired,

37:32.618 --> 37:33.919
It's a girl.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.660
Welcome to the world, kiddo.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.929
I promise it won't always
be this insane.

37:43.962 --> 37:46.732
Hey, are you okay?

37:46.765 --> 37:48.467
Well,
all things considered.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.969
Was I right about the body?

37:51.002 --> 37:53.772
You were right.
GSW to the chest.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.841
Looking like they had a hidden
basement in the house

37:55.874 --> 37:58.410
where they put the body
when Smitty came calling.

37:58.444 --> 38:00.946
You definitely win
the best childbirth story.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.582
I don't know. You have
that whole Guatemala adventure.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.084
Yeah, but I didn't
have the baby down there.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.920
Accept the crown.
You earned it.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.656
Sgt. Grey: He's right.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.591
T.I.D.s are finishing up downstairs.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.192
You still got to talk
to the shooting team,

38:14.225 --> 38:16.161
but they can wait
a few days.

38:16.194 --> 38:17.329
You're on
maternity leave.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.998
Yes.
Uh, no more investigations.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.033
You promise?

38:22.067 --> 38:24.135

38:24.169 --> 38:25.837
comes into
my Mommy and Me class,

38:25.871 --> 38:27.005
then I will have
no choice.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.940
But, barring that,

38:28.974 --> 38:30.542
I will spend the next six weeks

this morning?

38:47.393 --> 38:49.828
Yeah.

38:49.861 --> 38:53.465
Rob and I are
having a hard time.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.545
Now, about Dad's house--

39:06.578 --> 39:08.179
You want to sell it
to the happy family

39:08.213 --> 39:09.515
because you're feeling nostalgic.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.082
No, I want to sell it
to the highest bidder

39:11.116 --> 39:12.684
because divorces aren't cheap,
and I need

39:12.718 --> 39:15.887

is Rob moving out?

I was thinking of moving.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.832
To where?

39:26.865 --> 39:28.366

that it might be weird

39:47.753 --> 39:49.054
working on the other side,

39:49.087 --> 39:50.622
but I think
it might actually work out.
