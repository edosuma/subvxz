00:07.802 --> 00:09.466
What's up with
you tonight, man?

00:09.501 --> 00:11.406
A bunch of girls
just walked by you,

00:11.440 --> 00:13.282
you didn't say hi
to not one of them.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.087
I don't know.
I'm just not feeling it.

00:15.121 --> 00:17.689
None of them really
stand out, you know?

00:22.722 --> 00:24.619
- Some stand out.
- Cougar!

00:24.654 --> 00:26.621
What's up, guys?

00:26.655 --> 00:28.959
Hey, Sammy!

00:28.994 --> 00:31.295
- Who's this?
- My new girlfriend.

00:31.329 --> 00:34.268
- I met her at the mall
yesterday. - I'm Sky.

00:34.303 --> 00:36.036
- This is Bianca.
- Hey!

00:36.071 --> 00:38.105
Sammy, can I talk
to you for a second?

00:38.140 --> 00:39.540
Sure. Hold on
one second, girls.

00:40.075 --> 00:42.508
You need to check
this girl's I.D.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.646
I can't! She doesn't take her
driver's license test until Monday!

00:45.680 --> 00:47.448
- You need to get them
out of here. - Really?

00:47.482 --> 00:49.852
- How old are you girls?
- 18.

00:54.626 --> 00:56.627
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:56.661 --> 00:58.662
I'm Lindsay.

00:59.697 --> 01:00.964
I'm Alex.

01:00.999 --> 01:03.066
- Have we met before?
- I love chicks!

01:06.904 --> 01:09.605
I love chicks!

01:09.639 --> 01:11.406
Yeah, this really
isn't my scene.

01:11.441 --> 01:12.941
- Yeah.
- Listen.

01:12.975 --> 01:15.242
I'm heading to a party
at the lacrosse house.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.777
- Would you care to join me?
- Yeah.

01:17.811 --> 01:20.912
- You want to go to another party?
- Yeah, let's do it.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.187
Thanks, man.

01:36.799 --> 01:38.867
Wow, this is
incredible.

01:38.901 --> 01:41.069
Mmm. If you think
this is incredible,

01:41.104 --> 01:43.339
You should see the
bedroom upstairs.

01:46.642 --> 01:48.510
I'll see you later.

02:04.256 --> 02:07.059
These bedrooms
are nice, huh?

02:07.093 --> 02:09.862
Mm-hmm.
I am gonna give you

02:09.895 --> 02:12.064
the full tour.

02:21.042 --> 02:23.143
Are you...
Are you texting?

02:23.178 --> 02:25.212
Uh, don't worry
about it.

02:25.246 --> 02:28.047
Just kiss me.

02:30.084 --> 02:31.684
Lindsay,
I got your text.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.419
What the hell's
going on?

02:33.453 --> 02:36.021
I'm making out with
a football player.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.923
This is what you get
for not proposing to me

02:37.957 --> 02:39.758
At the cotillion ball,
Duke Wellingham!

02:42.227 --> 02:44.161
Hey, I'm just gonna go.

02:44.196 --> 02:45.930
No.

02:45.964 --> 02:47.798
I think you're exactly
where you need to be...

02:47.833 --> 02:49.534
Champ.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Sync by fant0m
www.addic7ed.com

03:26.373 --> 03:28.408
May we have
the password?

03:29.942 --> 03:32.478
What password?

03:32.513 --> 03:34.214
The password
for the house.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.049
Oh, I...

03:36.083 --> 03:38.084
I must've
forgotten it.

03:38.119 --> 03:40.620
That's too bad. Because
here it makes no difference

03:40.655 --> 03:42.589
if you forgot it or
if you never knew it.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.591
Okay. Hold on!

03:44.625 --> 03:46.626
Let me see
if I can remember it.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.430
Lacrosse.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.934
"Lacrosse" what?

03:55.969 --> 03:59.537
Lacrosse... Bros.

04:02.741 --> 04:05.176
"Lacrosse Bros" what?

04:05.210 --> 04:07.812
Lacrosse Bros...

04:07.847 --> 04:09.648
Rule.

04:10.683 --> 04:14.285
"Lacrosse Bros
forever", champ.

04:31.170 --> 04:34.805
- What happened to you?
- The lacrosse team kicked my ass.

04:38.176 --> 04:41.078
- Did you just say "lacrosse"?
- Yeah. I went over there,

04:41.112 --> 04:43.246
A girl invited me
up to a room

04:43.280 --> 04:44.914
And then this guy duke
showed up, so please...

04:44.948 --> 04:46.549
God damn it, Moran!

04:46.583 --> 04:48.084
We are football players.

04:48.118 --> 04:50.720
We don't mingle with lacrosse
players. I told you that.

04:50.754 --> 04:52.822
You also say
a lot of stupid shit.

04:52.856 --> 04:54.824
- What's the big deal?
- The big deal is

04:54.858 --> 04:57.626
- You broke the truce.
- What truce?

04:59.963 --> 05:01.631
Since the beginning,

05:01.665 --> 05:04.100
football ruled B.M.S.

05:09.173 --> 05:11.809
<i>We got the glory,
we got the fame</i>

05:11.843 --> 05:14.044
<i>and we got the broads.</i>

05:14.079 --> 05:15.980
<i>But in the early '80s</i>

05:16.014 --> 05:17.549
<i>a new sport
came to campus...</i>

05:17.583 --> 05:21.686
<i>A sport called
lacrosse.</i>

05:21.721 --> 05:24.656
<i>The lacrosse players weren't as
talented as the football players,</i>

05:24.691 --> 05:27.225
<i>but what they lacked
in athletic ability,</i>

05:27.260 --> 05:29.360
<i>they made up for
with their good looks</i>

05:29.395 --> 05:31.896
<i>awesome hair and
their daddy's money.</i>

05:34.633 --> 05:37.101
<i>In 1982,
the campus proved</i>

05:37.135 --> 05:40.204
<i>too small for both
squads and a war erupted.</i>

05:40.239 --> 05:42.606
<i>No one knows the true
origins of the war,</i>

05:42.641 --> 05:44.275
<i>but whatever
the origins,</i>

05:44.309 --> 05:47.111
<i>the war was long
and it was brutal.</i>

05:47.145 --> 05:49.213
The war lasted
four years,

05:49.247 --> 05:53.317
ending in 1986 when a truce
was finally declared.

05:55.554 --> 05:58.656
For 24 years, football
and lacrosse have coexisted

05:58.690 --> 06:00.891
<i>peacefully
on this campus...</i>

06:00.926 --> 06:02.827
Until tonight.

06:03.361 --> 06:05.195
<i>Lacrosse rules, douchebags!</i>

06:07.665 --> 06:09.633
Craig?

06:09.667 --> 06:12.269
It's on, bro!
It's on!

06:16.081 --> 06:18.681
Duke Wellingham and
those lacrosse pussies

06:18.715 --> 06:20.582
don't know who the
hell they messed with.

06:20.617 --> 06:23.752
I hate Moran and Shilo
as much as everyone else,

06:23.786 --> 06:25.753
but they're still
football players,

06:25.788 --> 06:28.222
and that demands respect!

06:28.256 --> 06:31.358
Yeah! And we're gonna put dildos
on the lacrosse player's heads!

06:31.393 --> 06:33.093
- Yeah!
- Two points for Shilo.

06:33.127 --> 06:35.828
- Where's my baby? Are you okay?
- I'm right here.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.897
- You can still hold a football, right?
- I'm fine, baby.

06:37.932 --> 06:40.066
But those dudes are gonna be
mad they ever messed with us!

06:40.101 --> 06:42.635
- Yeah!
- Three points for Shilo.

06:42.670 --> 06:46.372
No, you will not
jeopardize our future.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.507
- Baby, they put
a big old... - Ends.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.344
I'll handle those
lacrosse players.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.779
You stay out of it.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.049
Okay. Okay.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.119
I'm so glad I've got you
looking out for me, baby.

06:59.153 --> 07:01.888
-6 points for Shilo.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.790
This war is
serious business.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.760
Those who aren't
with us are against us.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.130
And in the end
B.M.S. will have

07:09.164 --> 07:12.500
either a football team
or a lacrosse team,

07:12.534 --> 07:15.069
but it will not
have both!

07:20.241 --> 07:22.442
Where are they?

07:22.476 --> 07:25.911
- Who? - The lacrosse losers
who beat up my Craig.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.246
The boys are on
morning brunch.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.414
I'm Lindsay.

07:30.449 --> 07:32.183
Denise.

07:32.217 --> 07:34.318
Listen, last night was just such
drama, but you know boys...

07:34.352 --> 07:37.422
They're always
starting something.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.524
Wait a minute.
Do you live here?

07:39.558 --> 07:42.293
Oh, yes, but we are
planning on moving soon.

07:42.327 --> 07:44.795
We definitely need
a bigger foyer.

07:46.531 --> 07:48.933
Would you like
a drink?

07:48.967 --> 07:51.235
"Juan Cala de Mercues

07:51.270 --> 07:53.004
moved closer to Susan.

07:53.038 --> 07:56.508
The scent of her ripe
but forbidden fruit

07:56.542 --> 07:58.943
dancing inside
his nostrils."

07:58.978 --> 08:01.145
"Sensing Juan
Cala's attraction,

08:01.180 --> 08:04.816
Susan began to
unbutton her blouse...

08:06.685 --> 08:09.053
Exposing her
milky-white breasts."

08:10.389 --> 08:12.457
- I think we should stop there.
- Why?

08:12.491 --> 08:15.627
Because my favorite part of
these stories is the anticipation.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.428
Well, then let's
have lunch,

08:17.462 --> 08:19.797
I'll shower,
I'll brush my teeth

08:19.832 --> 08:22.233
and then we can continue
reading until the end.

08:22.268 --> 08:25.136
Okay. I'm so glad to be
your girlfriend, Sammy.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.971
Oh my God!
Me too.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.609
Dude, lock all the doors.

08:30.643 --> 08:33.378
Things are getting
really really crazy.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.480
- Hi, Alex.
- Seriously?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.015
What?! What...
What is your problem?

08:38.549 --> 08:39.919
<i>Open the door, Moran!</i>

08:41.154 --> 08:43.522
You've been selected
for a mission, Moran.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.157
I really don't think
that's a good idea.

08:45.191 --> 08:49.194
Bro, that must've been
a horrible birthday.

08:49.228 --> 08:51.496
What did you do?

08:51.530 --> 08:54.699
I threw that cheap-ass Rolex at
mom and told her to get me a patek

08:54.733 --> 08:56.501
or I was going to
Spain for christmas.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.374
No!

09:02.408 --> 09:05.077
Help! Help!
Somebody!

09:05.111 --> 09:08.747
Moran,
get down here.

09:08.781 --> 09:10.849
- Moran, get down here.
- This is ridiculous.

09:13.185 --> 09:14.919
I don't know about this.
I think this is over the top.

09:14.954 --> 09:16.755
Yeah, you touch my
hair with those scissors,

09:16.789 --> 09:19.391
my dad'll sue your ass.
He's the biggest lawyer

09:19.425 --> 09:21.659
in Connecticut, champ.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.897
Okay, just this once.

09:25.931 --> 09:29.066
No, not my hair, bro.
Not my flow. Come on!

09:29.100 --> 09:31.468
No! No. No.

09:31.502 --> 09:33.737
No! No!

09:35.971 --> 09:37.275
You're gonna die!

09:37.309 --> 09:39.310
And the worst thing
about duke is that

09:39.345 --> 09:42.481
I know he's seeing
other girls.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.716
I knew it.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.618
Of course he
does, Lindsay.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.020
He's a laxer.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.489
They're the hottest,
richest guys on campus.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.558
And it comes
with the territory.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.427
Wait...

09:54.461 --> 09:56.862
You girls are
all fine with that?

09:56.897 --> 09:59.732
Well, what other
choice do I have?

09:59.766 --> 10:02.768
I mean, duke's family
practically started Connecticut.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.670
I'm just lucky
to know him.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.605
Who cares what
his family started?!

10:06.640 --> 10:10.142
You girls need to learn
to stick up for yourselves.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.976
How do we do that?

11:04.237 --> 11:07.772
- Hello?
- Larry, is that you?

11:07.806 --> 11:11.009
- Yeah.
- Oh... Thank God!

11:11.043 --> 11:13.612
<i>Larry, those assholes
built a mirror maze.</i>

11:13.646 --> 11:15.514
<i>I've been lost
inside here for hours.</i>

11:15.548 --> 11:19.485
Hold tight.
I'm coming to get you.

11:19.519 --> 11:21.687
<i>No, Larry, don't come in!
You'll never get out!</i>

11:21.722 --> 11:25.958
<i>Thad, where are you?</i>

11:25.993 --> 11:28.427
<i>I'm lost in the
mirror maze!</i>

11:28.462 --> 11:29.762
<i>Damn it, Larry!</i>

12:29.791 --> 12:31.758
My car.
What?

12:33.528 --> 12:35.195
Do something,
you idiots!

12:35.230 --> 12:36.831
No!

12:42.638 --> 12:45.741
Do something!

12:45.775 --> 12:47.710
That's my baby.

12:48.492 --> 12:50.426
"The door to the
chateau closed,

12:51.461 --> 12:53.061
leaving them alone
for the first time.

12:53.096 --> 12:55.697
Juan Cala de
Mercues quivered

12:55.732 --> 12:57.566
as his loins swelled."

12:57.600 --> 13:00.736
"Susan savored
Juan Cala's scent

13:00.770 --> 13:03.673
and she felt the storm begin
to rage between her thighs."

13:05.707 --> 13:07.410
Oh my God!

13:07.944 --> 13:09.678
It's such a
beautiful story.

13:11.448 --> 13:13.849
Blue 38! Hut hut!

13:23.591 --> 13:25.027
Holy shit!

13:25.061 --> 13:27.763
- They buried Moran.
- How long you been in there?

13:27.797 --> 13:29.364
Practice started
10 minutes ago.

13:29.398 --> 13:32.567
Oh, coach, it's kind
of hard to say.

13:32.601 --> 13:34.201
Don't worry, Moran.
I've got your back.

13:34.235 --> 13:35.903
Those lacrosse
dicks are dead.

13:35.937 --> 13:37.905
Lacrosse?

13:37.939 --> 13:40.474
You're saying the lacrosse
team is responsible for this?

13:40.508 --> 13:42.875
- Yes, coach.
- Wait! Hey, guys,

13:42.910 --> 13:44.878
we can just let
it go. It's fine.

13:44.912 --> 13:46.345
They interrupt
my practice

13:46.380 --> 13:47.847
and they ruined
my field.

13:47.881 --> 13:50.049
I don't want this thing
to go unpunished.

13:50.083 --> 13:51.951
Do you hear me?

13:51.985 --> 13:53.686
All right, back to
practice! Come on!

13:53.720 --> 13:55.721
Wait wait wait!
He's encouraging this?

13:55.755 --> 13:57.589
Man, I twisted
my ankle!

13:57.624 --> 13:59.357
You got buried
in cement.

13:59.391 --> 14:02.427
We've got to put an end to
this before somebody gets hurt.

14:03.996 --> 14:06.030
So if there was a truce
that was reached before,

14:06.065 --> 14:07.965
there's gotta be
a way to do it again.

14:10.769 --> 14:12.704
Oh my God!

14:12.738 --> 14:14.372
It's the cougar.

14:14.406 --> 14:16.407
No shit...
She was there.

14:17.776 --> 14:20.645
Ladies, this...

14:22.347 --> 14:24.115
Is our power.

14:24.149 --> 14:26.417
And under no
circumstances

14:26.451 --> 14:28.219
do you give up
that power

14:28.253 --> 14:31.322
until we are married and
signed up for half his shit.

14:36.461 --> 14:38.996
Yeah, that's me.

14:39.030 --> 14:40.731
I was so innocent
back then.

14:40.766 --> 14:42.933
So I know this was
a long time ago,

14:42.968 --> 14:45.902
but do you know
how the war ended?

14:45.937 --> 14:49.607
Of course.
It was ended by me.

14:49.641 --> 14:51.642
Let me show you
something.

14:58.885 --> 15:01.487
"V" for virginity.

15:01.521 --> 15:04.190
- Virginity?
- For reasons still unknown,

15:04.224 --> 15:06.593
during the war the lacrosse
players found themselves

15:06.627 --> 15:08.428
incredibly sexually
frustrated.

15:08.463 --> 15:11.031
And I found myself in a position
to do something about it.

15:11.065 --> 15:14.836
Only the allure of a virgin
would bring peace to both houses.

15:14.870 --> 15:18.539
Okay, so you slept with the entire
lacrosse team and the war just went away?

15:18.574 --> 15:22.110
Well, I slept with both teams
but, yes, the war went away.

15:22.144 --> 15:24.112
So what does this mean?
We have to find a virgin

15:24.146 --> 15:27.382
- that wants to bang the entire lacrosse
team? - Well, good luck with that.

15:27.416 --> 15:29.851
I don't think there's a virgin
left on the entire campus.

15:29.886 --> 15:32.220
- Oh my God! Wait, I know one.
- Don't even think about it.

15:32.255 --> 15:34.222
- What are you talking about?
- Denise.

15:34.257 --> 15:37.258
Mmm. That's not
who I had in mind.

15:39.595 --> 15:42.596
"And with that,
Juan Cala de Mercues

15:42.631 --> 15:45.298
And Susan held
each other tightly

15:45.333 --> 15:48.134
knowing this could be
their last embrace."

15:54.012 --> 15:56.313
- Alex!
- Sammy.

15:56.348 --> 15:59.517
Dude, so much has happened
since you've been gone.

16:01.687 --> 16:03.520
Dude, what happened
to you? Look at this.

16:03.955 --> 16:05.022
Sorry.

16:05.057 --> 16:07.090
A lot, actually,

16:07.125 --> 16:09.292
which is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

16:09.826 --> 16:11.628
I have a favor to ask.

16:11.662 --> 16:13.663
Ask away, man!

16:15.799 --> 16:17.433
Okay, I don't know
how to ask this,

16:17.467 --> 16:20.269
- so I'm just gonna
put it out there. - Okay.

16:20.303 --> 16:23.905
I need a virgin who's willing to
have sex with the lacrosse team.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.973
Yup. I'm not
a virgin, bro.

16:26.008 --> 16:27.908
- You know that.
- Right.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.678
And you're not exactly
who I was thinking of.

16:30.712 --> 16:32.780
I was thinking more
along the lines of...

16:33.314 --> 16:35.516
I don't know... Sky.

16:36.852 --> 16:39.020
Oh, you're good, man!

16:39.055 --> 16:41.189
Oh my God, you're doing this
with the whole straight face.

16:41.224 --> 16:43.258
This face is
like... "Virgin."

16:43.292 --> 16:45.528
No no no, Sammy, listen
to me for a second, okay?

16:45.562 --> 16:48.263
If we don't do this,
we're all gonna die.

16:48.298 --> 16:51.133
I know you've only known her for
a few days, you're like that...

16:51.168 --> 16:52.768
And are you
wearing boat shoes?

16:52.803 --> 16:55.305
- You're making fun of
my shoes. - Oh, hey!

16:55.339 --> 16:57.141
- What's so funny?
- Oh my God, Alex was just

16:57.175 --> 16:59.944
making a hilarious joke
about you. You tell her.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.213
You know what? Forget it.
Forget I asked anything.

17:02.247 --> 17:04.082
Hmm, you have
to tell her.

17:04.116 --> 17:07.151
- It is hilarious.
- Please tell me!

17:08.219 --> 17:09.987
Okay.

17:10.021 --> 17:13.490
So the football team

17:13.525 --> 17:15.893
is in a war with the
lacrosse team...

17:15.926 --> 17:18.561
You know, a very destructive,
horrible horrible war.

17:18.596 --> 17:22.065
I heard about that.
That's really tragic.

17:22.099 --> 17:24.468
Yeah, and don't ask me why,

17:24.502 --> 17:28.306
but they need a virgin to
bring peace to the campus.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.143
I'm a virgin.

17:31.177 --> 17:33.378
I thought you might be.

17:33.412 --> 17:35.981
Two warring houses.

17:36.015 --> 17:39.752
Two lovers forced to sacrifice
their love for the greater good...

17:40.286 --> 17:44.224
Just like Juan Cala
de Mercues and Susan.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.394
- I'll do it.
- Great.

17:47.428 --> 17:49.496
Wait wait. What?

17:49.531 --> 17:52.099
- Okay.
- Don't you see, sweetie?

17:52.133 --> 17:53.901
This is all
meant to be.

17:53.935 --> 17:56.270
All love ends tragically,

17:56.305 --> 17:57.939
just like Juan and Susan.

18:00.110 --> 18:02.745
- This is real?
- Yeah.

18:02.779 --> 18:04.980
Are you serious?

18:06.382 --> 18:09.084
Susan would never bang
the entire lacrosse team.

18:09.118 --> 18:11.152
She would for Juan.

18:11.187 --> 18:13.421
Do you even
know Susan?

18:13.455 --> 18:15.222
I don't know why, but this
is the only way, Sammy.

18:15.257 --> 18:17.257
I know why...
It's destiny.

18:17.291 --> 18:19.392
There's gotta be
another virgin on campus.

18:19.427 --> 18:21.627
- Think about what you
just said. - Oh God!

18:21.662 --> 18:25.698
No! No, I won't think
about anything!

19:54.926 --> 19:57.896
You'll always be my
Juan Cala de Mercues.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.798
Yeah, whatever.
