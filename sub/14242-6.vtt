- Assistance now!
- Come on.

00:31.040 --> 00:34.759
Look, he's my dad, OK? He's my father.
Now, I need you to look after him.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.599
Sorry, your father's been reclassified -
he's Category 1 .

00:37.720 --> 00:39.759
- My father is not dead.
- Then we have to move him.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.479
All Category 1 s go to the module.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.799
So we need to get inside the camp
to find out what those modules are.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.759
Welcome, welcome. My name is
Colin Maloney, and I'm in charge here.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.759

- Get your hands the hell off me!

on the Shanghai Deal,

01:09.960 --> 01:15.079
and you're due to chair the PhiCorp
executive board at four o'clock.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.199
Thanks, Janet.

01:18.320 --> 01:22.519
Stuart, is everything all right?
You don't seem happy.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.359
STUART: Everything's fine.
We're living in miraculous times.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.599
I couldn't be happier.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.919
You shouldn't call me Stuart
in the office.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.999
Sorry, Mr Owens.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.559
Of course, suicide is impossible now,

01:37.680 --> 01:39.319
but people are becoming inventive.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.919
They're finding ways to get
as close to death as possible.

01:42.040 --> 01:45.959
That's the philosophy of the 45 Club,

01:46.080 --> 01:49.159
people who believe that jumping
from 45 floors up or higher

01:49.280 --> 01:52.879
is the only guaranteed way
to lose consciousness for ever.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.799
It's sick, but just the same,
the 45 Club is catching on.

It's Stuart Owens.

02:12.960 --> 02:13.959
How can I help you, sir?

02:14.080 --> 02:17.279
This must be strictly confidential.
My eyes only.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.679
Is that acceptable?

02:18.800 --> 02:20.599
Of course.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.079
In 1 999,

02:22.200 --> 02:25.159
a large parcel of land,
near Shanghai Centre,

02:25.280 --> 02:27.759
was purchased by a division of PhiCorp.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.279
But that's where the records end.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.679
I need to know exactly

02:31.800 --> 02:33.119
what's happened to the land since then.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.359
PhiCorp Construction?

02:34.480 --> 02:37.039
Not on paper. There are subsidiaries,

02:37.160 --> 02:38.439
shell companies.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.639
May I ask what this is about?

02:42.840 --> 02:44.399
Do you need to know?

02:44.520 --> 02:46.039
It could be of some help.

02:47.480 --> 02:51.039
Of course, you are aware of
the changes going on in the world.

02:51.160 --> 02:55.479
Yes. My uncle was dying. Now he's not.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.879
I'm trying to understand what happened,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.759
whether PhiCorp
had anything to do with it.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.079
I believe this construction site is key.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.719
I asked my uncle what happened.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.559
He told me to never question a miracle.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.399
You may not like what you find.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.439

- What do you mean?

04:41.680 --> 04:43.319
What are they building?

04:43.440 --> 04:47.519
There's nothing there. I looked.
I found nothing, nothing at all.

inside the San Pedro Overflow.

I'm not with the CIA

06:01.640 --> 06:04.039
or any US Government authority.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.399
I'm with Torchwood,

06:06.520 --> 06:09.239

that's going on here,

06:33.920 --> 06:36.039
They're calling them Category 1 s,

06:36.160 --> 06:40.239
and from what I've seen,
don't ever let them call you that.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.559
The minute you hear Category 1 ,
you better get the hell out of Dodge,

06:44.680 --> 06:47.399

And we all know the drill.

06:56.840 --> 07:00.079
They'll start with the Category 1 s,
the ones who can't protest.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.519
Then they'll go on to convicted felons
or illegal immigrants, hell...

07:05.360 --> 07:08.519

that killed Vera.

I said, "That's my money." They said,
"It's a national emergency." I said,

then I'm going to need every cent."

- Not a problem,

not any more.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.319
I scrubbed my hands raw.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.439
But you see it on TV. They...

still find tiny little flecks
of blood under the nails.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.199

until some senator signs some paperwork
and gives the command.

- But what did you do?

09:16.880 --> 09:18.159

09:18.280 --> 09:20.879

10:02.320 --> 10:03.839
in cash. Not sure.

if there's anything else I can do for you,
just ask, anything at all.

- No, thanks. Fine.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.759
Yes, sir.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.439
Oh, my God. I did not agree to this.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.559
- Everything's going to be fine.
- But we murdered her!

10:54.680 --> 10:56.119
No, no...

10:57.760 --> 10:59.079
The modules were designed to kill.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.159

death within this compound is legal.

They're illegal immigrants, all of them.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.159
They can't even spell. Look at this.
This is wrong...

11:11.280 --> 11:15.039
- We're going to get arrested for this.
- No. No, we won't. No, no, no, no.

but not here. This is wrong!

and drive it into San Pedro.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.399

past there every half hour,

- Is that going to work?
- Ralph...

she's dust.

And we put this place on a red alert,

of the staff is logged and noted.

have to be authorised by me.

- No, she left. She's gone.

Matter of fact, she said I was running
an excellent command. Very good indeed.

- I've seen him, he's just unconscious.
- Well, it's debatable.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.679
There's a fine line
between Category 1 and 2...

14:06.800 --> 14:08.639
No, but you saw him. You labelled him.

14:08.760 --> 14:09.799
And there's definitely been a mistake.

given by the government.

I'd have to do it for everyone.

what your department is, Dr Patel?

14:32.440 --> 14:36.239
Do you even know what really happens here?
Do you know what happens in the module?

14:36.360 --> 14:38.159
Like I said, I'm rather busy.

14:38.280 --> 14:41.359
They burn people. They burn living people.

14:41.480 --> 14:45.279
The Category 1 s, they're still alive,
but they're being burnt.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.959
This place has been built
around institutional murder.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.879
I'm not the one who makes the rules.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.399
You knew about this?

14:51.520 --> 14:53.639
Category 1 s are dead. That's the law.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.879
Under the emergency rulings

14:56.000 --> 14:59.319
for the sake of public health,
dead bodies can be incinerated en masse.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.839
Well, I'm glad you've got
the law on your side.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.399
But are you actually there,
in the module?

15:04.520 --> 15:06.319
Are you actually throwing the switch?

15:07.880 --> 15:10.319
Well, are you? No. No, you're here.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.319
You're nice and safe,
hidden behind your paperwork.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.279
You haven't got the nerve
to actually watch them burn.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.119
Because then you'd have
to face the truth, wouldn't you?

15:18.240 --> 15:20.639
That this isn't a hospital,
this is a concentration camp.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.639
If you'll excuse me...

15:22.760 --> 15:27.239
They built a concentration camp
here in Britain today, and you...you, you

15:27.360 --> 15:28.279
are one of the staff!

15:28.400 --> 15:30.599
The entire healthcare system
is about to collapse.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.639
- What else am I supposed to do?
- You say no.

15:35.280 --> 15:38.279
You say no, that's what you do.
For the love of God, you say no.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.639
- But I can't.
- Don't you dare.

15:40.760 --> 15:45.359
Don't you dare. Don't you dare look at me
and tell me you're obeying orders.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.719
Don't you bloody dare.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.039
Oh...and one more thing...

15:55.080 --> 15:57.479
...don't call yourself a doctor.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.279
Not any more.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.879
Shame on you.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.079
Rhys!

16:17.200 --> 16:18.919
Oh, my God,
I was driving them to the module!

16:19.040 --> 16:20.839
I was driving living people
into the ovens!

16:20.960 --> 16:22.799
You weren't to know, all right?
You were just doing yourjob.

16:22.920 --> 16:23.839
Yeah, well, I'm not doing it any more.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.359
- I quit the bastard thing.
- Well, not just yet.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.319
I need you to do
one more transfer for me -

16:27.440 --> 16:28.839
my dad, we're taking him out.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.119
We can't.
The, um, the compound's closed down.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.799
- No more movement orders till 6am.
- I know, Rhys!

16:33.920 --> 16:34.959
That's when they're going
to take my father to his death!

16:35.080 --> 16:36.719
All right?
I need you to steal some keys.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.919
I need you to get a hold of a lorry.
I don't...

16:39.040 --> 16:40.599
I don't know.
I just need you to do something.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.439
- Of course I will.
- The, um...

16:42.560 --> 16:45.159
The nurses, they change over at 5am.
That's our only chance.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.519
- I'll get my dad, you get a truck, OK?
- OK!

16:47.640 --> 16:49.559
We can do this, OK?
We can beat the system.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.359
We can beat them all. All right?

16:51.480 --> 16:52.479
Go!

16:58.040 --> 16:59.999
(PHONE BEEPS)

17:12.400 --> 17:17.439
No, Janet, you don't know me,
but...I know you.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.999
Yeah?

17:20.360 --> 17:21.519
You work at PhiCorp?

17:21.640 --> 17:23.199
You didn't answer my question.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.359
What are you drinking?

17:27.600 --> 17:29.079
Appletini.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.399
Your name is Janet Rae Tanner.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.079
You're 27 years old, 5'9", 1 1 9 lbs.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.319
The youngest daughter
of Gerald and Elaine Tanner

17:39.440 --> 17:43.239
of Nantucket, Massachusetts.
You moved to California to attend college,

17:43.360 --> 17:45.279
where you earned
a bachelor's degree in art history.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.199
You currently reside
at a Westwood apartment.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.479
You go to the gym three times a week

17:50.600 --> 17:52.279
and you drive your hybrid
downtown every day

17:52.400 --> 17:55.319
to an administrative assistant position
at PhiCorp Industries.

17:55.440 --> 17:59.679
And you're some creepy stalker dude
last seen on America's Most Wanted.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.239
I may be wanted,
but it's not what you think.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.959
Listen,

18:06.080 --> 18:09.759
I don't know what kind of game you're
playing, but...I'm meeting someone.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.039
After he has dinner with his wife.

18:13.920 --> 18:18.999
I came across some e-mails
from you to your boss, Stuart Owens.

18:19.120 --> 18:23.319
(SCOFFS) "Can't wait to see you." Nice.

18:23.440 --> 18:27.159
Then "Happy Valentine's Day." Sweet!

18:27.280 --> 18:30.119
Then a little less subtle.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.639
"You can so do me tonight." Ouch!

18:33.760 --> 18:35.239
What do you want?

18:35.360 --> 18:37.279
I want your help, Janet. Right now,

18:37.400 --> 18:39.719
I've got some friends
risking their lives because we think

18:39.840 --> 18:41.719
PhiCorp is doing some very bad things

18:41.840 --> 18:44.519
and we need to find out who's behind it.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.159
Please, you can't tell anybody about us.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.879
I won't. I just want some information
from your boss.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.279
I wouldn't do anything to hurt him.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.239
Sweet Janet Rae,
I wish he felt the same about you.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.439
I'm sending you some more e-mails

19:00.560 --> 19:04.839
from Stuart Owens to the head
of PhiCorp human resources,

19:04.960 --> 19:08.199
requesting your transfer
to Cincinnati! Whoo-hoo!

19:08.320 --> 19:09.879
He's such a romantic.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.519
Bastard.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.479
I like the bit
where he calls you "limited".

19:13.600 --> 19:15.559
"Limited."

19:18.120 --> 19:19.879
So what do you say, Janet?

19:20.920 --> 19:24.039
We could sit here drinking appletinis
and complaining about men all night.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.159
Or we can go get that
PhiCorp boss of yours.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.759
What do you say, Janet Rae?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.199
(MURMUR OF CONVERSATION)

19:42.800 --> 19:45.079
Love the vintage coat!

19:45.200 --> 19:48.359
Thanks. Maybe the three of us
should have a drink sometime.

19:48.480 --> 19:53.359
- The three of us?
- You, me...and the coat.

19:53.480 --> 19:54.559
(SMACK)

20:00.520 --> 20:03.359
Well, I suppose I should have the salad.

20:03.480 --> 20:04.799
I'd go for the steak if I were you,

20:04.920 --> 20:06.919
with a very large bourbon
and a pack of cigarettes.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.799
Why not?
We're going to live for ever, right?

20:09.920 --> 20:10.999
Courtesy of PhiCorp.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.439
Excuse me,
I think you're at the wrong table.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.519
You're Stuart Owens, aren't you?

20:14.640 --> 20:18.919
You're the Chief Operating Officer
for PhiCorp Industries.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.479
Well, you obviously know who I am
or you wouldn't be here.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.359
The question is, who are you?

20:23.480 --> 20:26.799
I'm a friend ofJanet's. Your secretary?

20:26.920 --> 20:30.159
We met at a bar, the one you were
planning on going to after dinner.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.759
(WHISPERS LOUDLY) Does your wife know?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.359
- Elizabeth...
- Don't go,

20:36.480 --> 20:39.279
or we'll hurt her. My associates
are holding Janet hostage.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.879
- You need proof?
- (RINGING TONE)

20:44.000 --> 20:46.839
- Hello? Who's there?
- Help. Help me.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.639
- Janet, where are you?
- I don't know.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.199
I'm in a cellar. They've got me tied up.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.639
They're hurting me, Stuart.
Make them stop.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.679
What exactly do you want?

20:57.800 --> 20:59.079
I'll let you know
when it's safe to release her.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.879
Go get him.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.559
The truth.

21:08.680 --> 21:09.839
About what?

21:09.960 --> 21:13.039
The miracle. How was it done?
Why was it done?

21:13.160 --> 21:14.439
How can it be undone?

21:14.560 --> 21:17.519
- Why would I have the answer?
- When the day came,

21:17.640 --> 21:21.519
PhiCorp was ready. We found
warehouses stocked with painkillers

21:21.640 --> 21:24.999
- waiting for the miracle to come along.
- That's your smoking gun?

21:25.120 --> 21:26.519
You're a man in charge.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.799
- You knew it was coming.
- Mr...

21:28.920 --> 21:31.359
Harkness. Captain Jack Harkness.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.239
- Are you with the military?
- Freelance.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.079
I represent the people
who are trying to stop PhiCorp.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.039
So that security breach

21:37.160 --> 21:38.919
- on the 33rd floor...
- That was us.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.399
It's not me you're after.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.439
In fact, I've been trying to find out
the truth just as much as you.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.799
I'm not...a bad man, Mr Harkness.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.239
- Captain.
- I'm not a bad man, Captain.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.799
I'm not a good one, either.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.239
I'm a middleman,
in every sense of the word.

21:59.360 --> 22:03.239
And faced with the thought of being
who I am for God knows how long,

22:03.360 --> 22:06.639
I'm just as keen as you to find out
exactly what's going on.

22:06.760 --> 22:10.319
Especially with the stock market
threatening to collapse,

22:10.440 --> 22:12.679
a man like me needs insurance.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.999
(LAUGHS) You don't believe me.

22:16.120 --> 22:20.839
You think I'm the epitome of evil,
the devil in a three-piece suit.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.559
In my experience, that's how it works.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.639
Your experience must be rather simple.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.679
You have a rather archaic view
of good versus evil, don't you?

22:29.800 --> 22:31.719
Tell me who's behind this.

22:31.840 --> 22:34.399
I've been trying to find out!

22:34.520 --> 22:37.519
I've sent agents all over the world
following the paper trail,

22:37.640 --> 22:40.999
the back-room deals, the holding
companies within holding companies.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.479
That's when I came face to face
with the true face of evil.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.159
- The system itself.
- Precisely.

22:48.280 --> 22:52.079
If schemes and conspiracies
are being plotted,

22:52.200 --> 22:56.279
then they must be seen
only as patterns, waves...

22:56.400 --> 23:01.559
shifts that are either too small
or too vast to be perceived.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.759
Someone is playing the system,
right across Planet Earth,

23:03.880 --> 23:07.039
with infinite grace
beyond any one person's sight.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.279
No, I'm sorry, Captain,

23:09.400 --> 23:12.239
but PhiCorp isn't controlling this.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.919
Profiting, yes,

23:14.040 --> 23:19.039
but this is part of a much larger design,
way beyond any of us.

23:19.160 --> 23:22.639
But how can you be part of it
and not know what's going on?

23:22.760 --> 23:26.199
Let me give you an example -
these warehouses full of drugs,

23:26.320 --> 23:29.679
no doubt you'd love
to uncover an incriminating memo

23:29.800 --> 23:32.319
dated the day before Miracle Day,
signed by me,

23:32.440 --> 23:35.719
authorising the stockpiling
of painkillers.

23:35.840 --> 23:39.479
The truth is, a pattern like that began,
say, maybe five years ago

23:39.600 --> 23:41.719
with the systematic increase in production

23:41.840 --> 23:46.239
in random factories around the world,
based on market-share projections.

23:46.360 --> 23:48.119
Where was the warehouse?

23:48.240 --> 23:50.279
Washington DC, 3rd and Boston.

23:50.400 --> 23:53.959
I'd imagine transportation
of the drugs to the 3rd and Boston

23:54.080 --> 23:56.559
was then carried out
over a 1 2-month period

23:56.680 --> 23:58.999
by, say, maybe
five different haulage companies

23:59.120 --> 24:01.879
outsourced to seven or eight
different independent suppliers.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.679
So that means everyone's to blame -
everyone and no-one.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.159
Whoever is behind this,
they don't show themselves.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.559
Not to me, not to you.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.719
But to play the system like this -

24:13.840 --> 24:17.279
the markets, the politics, industry...

24:18.480 --> 24:22.159
...they had to be planning this
for a very long time.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.359
I wish I knew who they were.

24:27.080 --> 24:32.199
I was told that the miracle
involves geography.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.719
- Does that mean anything?
- No.

24:34.840 --> 24:38.079
But there is one word
that my operatives picked up

24:38.200 --> 24:40.079
dating back to the mid-'90s

24:40.200 --> 24:42.039
- and then erased.
- What is it?

24:42.160 --> 24:43.439
The Blessing.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.199
What does it mean?

24:47.280 --> 24:48.559
There was a document from Italy

24:48.680 --> 24:52.959
from a source inside the Council
Of Ministers, a contact then deceased.

24:53.080 --> 24:54.959
It simply referred to the Blessing.

24:55.080 --> 25:00.199
It said, "They have found the Blessing."

25:00.320 --> 25:02.279
MAN: Excuse me. Could you direct us

25:02.400 --> 25:04.479
- to Mr Owen's table?
- That's his table there.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.279
It seems my wife called the authorities.
Hmm.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.399
Go ahead.

25:18.720 --> 25:39.199
(HELICOPTER WHIRRS OVERHEAD)

26:12.400 --> 26:13.519
(CRASHING)

26:13.640 --> 26:15.319
What the hell was that?

26:15.440 --> 26:16.719
Check it out.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.799
Sir? Are you all right?

26:34.120 --> 26:36.279
What's a Cat 1 doing out here?

26:36.400 --> 26:37.599
Sorry.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.839
RADIO: Billy, do you read me?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.319
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's me.
- What's going on?

26:49.440 --> 26:52.959
- Well, we got new orders.
- New orders?

26:53.080 --> 26:55.359
Yeah. They need you at the modules.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.879
They, um, they need
more men at the module.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.999
You'd better get down there pronto.
I'm already here.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.199
What about the checkpoint?

27:02.320 --> 27:05.199
I don't know, they said to just leave it.
They said, um...

27:05.320 --> 27:06.639
I don't know what they said,
I wasn't listening.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.879
That sounds like you. I'm on my way.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.079
LOUD SPEAKER: Identifyyourself.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.879
Uh...

27:27.000 --> 27:28.679
- Identify yourself.
- Just need to get out.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.359
Going out for a smoke.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.959
Sure, man. Go ahead.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.279
Who the hell are you?

27:49.640 --> 27:52.119
Someone's breached the compound,
someone with a camera.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.719
No, no, no. Nothing's going wrong.
Nothing, nothing, nothing...

27:54.840 --> 27:56.879
He wants to talk to whoever's in charge.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.479
No, he doesn't. No, no, no.
No, he doesn't. No.

27:59.600 --> 28:03.799
OK...who is he?

28:05.440 --> 28:07.999
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know. He said, "Torchwood."

28:08.120 --> 28:10.359
All right, you wait here.
I'll deal with it.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.399
Mr Maloney,
I need your signature on this.

28:14.520 --> 28:15.439
- Not now.
- I can walk with you, but...

28:15.560 --> 28:16.839
I said, "Not now!"

28:22.880 --> 28:24.599
So where's he going?

28:30.600 --> 28:32.399
Where do you think you're going?

28:34.520 --> 28:35.439
Mr Maloney.

28:35.560 --> 28:38.239
How blonde are you? It's a lockdown.

28:38.360 --> 28:41.079
We haven't got clearance.
Got to stay at your desk.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.839
I'm telling you right now,
you're making a big mistake.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.759
You're gonna all be implicated,
all of you.

29:07.520 --> 29:11.039
All right, leave us alone.
Go to Jackson on the west gate.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.119
He's got new allocations for you.

29:14.720 --> 29:15.999
So, who the hell are you?

29:16.120 --> 29:18.159
I'll ask the questions.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.559
- I need to know who you are.
- I told them already,

29:21.680 --> 29:24.799
Rex Matheson.
Now, who the hell are you?

29:24.920 --> 29:29.279
Colin Maloney, thank you,
director of the San Pedro Facility.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.759
Director, hmm.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.639
There's going to be hell to pay,
cos you're the man in charge.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.279
- What do you mean?
- Look, just call the police, OK?

29:36.400 --> 29:39.359
Go ahead, call them. Arrest me.
Because I want to make a statement.

29:39.480 --> 29:42.119
I'm going to expose everything
that's going on here,

29:42.240 --> 29:44.999
what you guys are doing to the patients
and what you did to Vera.

29:45.120 --> 29:48.199
- What they did to who?
- You built ovens!

29:48.320 --> 29:51.159
And you're the director so you know that.

29:53.520 --> 29:54.879
I'm not in charge of policy.

29:57.320 --> 30:01.239
We had instructions that got
sent out nationwide, worldwide.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.839
And we had orders from above not
to say anything. I just did as I was told.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.359
OK.

30:06.480 --> 30:10.439
All right. OK, you're the middleman.
I get it.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.119
But I'm telling you right now
you need to listen.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.639
Because you're caught in the middle
of this thing just like me.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.159
There are things are happening here
that's way out of control.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.919
Someone's using this place
to bring back murder!

30:23.040 --> 30:26.399
There was a DrJuarez on this site, right?
Hmm? Yeah?

30:26.520 --> 30:27.799
Well, someone burned her alive.

30:29.600 --> 30:33.199
- No, no, no, no, no. Couldn't happen.
- And you've got the chance now...

30:33.320 --> 30:35.679
Look at me. Look at me.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.559
You've got the chance
to make yourself a hero,

30:39.680 --> 30:41.639
because we could tell the world.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.759
- Yeah, I'd be a hero?
- Colin...

30:44.880 --> 30:48.319
my man, when this thing blows wide open,
people willstand trial

30:48.440 --> 30:50.439
for crimes against humanity.
But you see, you...

30:50.560 --> 30:54.279
you could be standing right by me,
right by my side.

30:56.320 --> 31:00.159
Well, I suppose, er...
it's my duty to help.

31:00.280 --> 31:03.199
If we could find the one to blame...
Must be...

31:03.320 --> 31:05.119
one of the staff, one of the guards.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.359
All right, well, look,
I've got evidence. It's right there.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.999
Go ahead, take a look.
They took it off me.

31:10.120 --> 31:14.799
I taped it. I taped everything.
You can see it all. It's proof

31:14.920 --> 31:19.039
that someone's using the modules for
murder, not just the Category 1 s either.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.119
I don't know. I... I shouldn't.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.599
Do you want proof, hmm?

31:24.720 --> 31:27.639
Then look at it. Take a look at it.

31:27.760 --> 31:31.519
Play the tape, damn it, and you'll see
why you need to let me go.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.039
I don't know. I shouldn't.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.399
Yeah, play it.

31:45.400 --> 31:50.359
I'm sorry. Um, Mr Maloney just called
about that Torchwood man.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.799
Sorry, I'm new to all this.

31:51.920 --> 31:55.919
But he wanted me to ask,
is his name Rex Matheson?

31:56.040 --> 31:57.639
Yeah.

31:58.960 --> 32:03.519
OK. I'll call them back.
Oh, um, what extension was he on?

32:03.640 --> 32:05.599
I don't know. Generator room.

32:05.720 --> 32:09.319
That was it. Yeah, thanks.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.399
I told you,
you can't go out in a lockdown.

32:13.520 --> 32:17.559
I said you're not allowed outside.
I'm reporting you!

32:30.120 --> 32:32.519
I'm sorry. I knew you had to see that.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.159
- You OK?
- Oh, yeah.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.639
All right, so now do you see?

32:37.760 --> 32:39.519
You see why you need
to release me, right?

32:39.640 --> 32:42.799
So come on, we should go
to the police together, right now.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.199
I don't know, it's a...

32:56.440 --> 32:58.519
I haven't got anything I can...

33:00.280 --> 33:01.999
You hurt yourself?

33:03.640 --> 33:06.879
Oh, yeah. It's a long story.
But come on...

33:07.000 --> 33:08.799
how about we get out of here, huh?

33:08.920 --> 33:12.719
I wonder... What can I use?
What can I...?

33:12.840 --> 33:15.079
They gave you the keys.

33:15.200 --> 33:18.319
- Yeah, but what can I use?
- You have the keys.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.879
I just can't focus, can't think. (SIGHS)

33:22.000 --> 33:25.599
I've never been too practical.
I'm more of an ideas man.

33:25.720 --> 33:28.839
I'm very good at badminton.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.719
Yeah, all right.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.559
Say, how about you, um, unlock me now?

33:46.600 --> 33:47.599
It'll have to do.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.119
What are you doing?

33:50.240 --> 33:53.079
Hey, Colin, look at me.
Colin, what are you doing?

33:53.200 --> 33:54.359
Look at me in my eyes.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.439
Colin, what are you doing?
Don't do that.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.519
Look at me. Colin, look at me in my eyes.
Look at me!

34:00.640 --> 34:02.639
Colin. Colin!

34:02.760 --> 34:05.239
Don't do it. Argh!

34:05.360 --> 34:08.079
(SCREAMS IN AGONY)

34:13.400 --> 34:14.399
It was you!

34:14.520 --> 34:15.799
I'm sorry.

34:15.920 --> 34:16.959
You killed her!

34:17.080 --> 34:20.479
I'm very sorry.
It's just been such a long day.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.999
All I want to do is go home.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.239
But you can't kill me.
Don't do it. I can't die.

34:24.360 --> 34:28.119
You can't kill me.
Colin, don't you see? I won't die.

34:28.240 --> 34:29.519
Argh!

34:29.640 --> 34:31.639
(SCREAMS IN AGONY)

34:37.880 --> 34:54.519
Mr Maloney?

34:56.760 --> 34:58.399
I'm here.

35:04.480 --> 35:05.679
What is it?

35:08.640 --> 35:12.279
Um, there's a phone call for you, sir.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.319
Very important. I...

35:13.440 --> 35:14.839
I could take over for you here.

35:14.960 --> 35:17.599
A phone call? Um, who is it?

35:17.720 --> 35:22.439
Um...DrJuarez.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.359
She said it's urgent.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.959
She said that, um,
she needs the population of the camp.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.919
DrJuarez?

35:31.040 --> 35:32.039
When did she call?

35:33.120 --> 35:34.119
Just now.

35:35.280 --> 35:36.319
Did you speak to her?

35:38.160 --> 35:40.999
Yes, yes, I did.

35:41.120 --> 35:44.519
And this was when? When exactly

35:44.640 --> 35:46.159
- was just now?
- Five minutes ago.

35:46.280 --> 35:50.079
- Esther! Esther!
- Rex?

35:50.200 --> 35:53.399
Esther, just run! He killed Vera!

35:56.280 --> 35:57.759
Esther!

35:57.880 --> 35:59.039
(SCREAMS)

36:04.000 --> 36:05.439
Leave her alone, damn it!

36:08.280 --> 36:10.799
Aaargh!

36:14.880 --> 36:17.279
(SHE SCREAMS)

36:17.400 --> 36:19.319
Argh! Agh!

36:37.040 --> 36:38.639
Esther!

36:55.920 --> 36:58.519
(GASPS)

37:07.640 --> 37:09.119
What happened?

37:12.480 --> 37:15.079
- I killed... I killed him.
- No.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.719
Oh, my God, I killed him, Rex.

37:16.840 --> 37:20.559
No, no. You didn't, OK?
Nobody dies, remember?

37:20.680 --> 37:23.519
He's just a Category 1 now.
Now, look, stay with me.

37:23.640 --> 37:26.359
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

37:26.480 --> 37:29.479
I need you to go in his pocket
and get the keys.

37:29.600 --> 37:30.519
- No.
- Esther,

37:30.640 --> 37:32.879
we've got to get out of here.
Come on, stay focused.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.999
Get the keys. Go get the key.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.239
(SHE SCREAMS)

38:20.200 --> 38:22.079
(GUNSHOT)

38:23.480 --> 38:25.039
This has got to stop.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.039
Thank you!

38:55.520 --> 38:57.679
Bloody hell!

38:58.920 --> 39:01.119
- What do you think you're doing?
- My job, isn't it?

39:01.240 --> 39:02.599
Don't scare a man like that.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.799
Patient transfer at this time of night?

39:04.920 --> 39:07.999
- I just do what I'm told.
- And exactly what were you told?

39:08.120 --> 39:10.679
- Patient transfer, 5am.
- Who told you this?

39:10.800 --> 39:13.079
- My supervisor, who else?
- What's his name?

39:14.240 --> 39:17.999
Um... Well, he's got more authority
than you, mate. He's a captain.

39:18.120 --> 39:21.839
Captain Jack Harkness. He ordered me.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.919
That's a bit odd.
I don't see a Harkness on our roster.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.759
I'd better make some calls.

39:33.400 --> 39:36.599
(WHISPERS) Oh...God!

39:39.600 --> 39:40.639
(WHISPERS) Typical!

39:43.200 --> 39:44.919
Not long now, Dad, I promise.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.839
Oh, hell to pay, Rhys Williams,
if you don't show. Hell to pay.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.639
(MUTTERS) Oh, mama...

40:07.080 --> 40:10.039
- Can I go now?
- I don't understand.

40:10.160 --> 40:13.439
They've stopped movement orders
until 6am,

40:13.560 --> 40:15.839
but you've been given
special instructions apparently.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.239
- Why's that, then?
- Yeah, well,

40:17.360 --> 40:20.759
this Captain Harkness
must have taken a shine to me.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.039
He had that look about him,
if you know what I mean.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.039
Not that there's anything wrong with that,
of course!

40:26.160 --> 40:28.959
Um... Oh, look at the time.
I'm late enough as it is.

40:29.080 --> 40:30.439
I need to make another call.

40:38.880 --> 40:42.159
MAN: Did you hear, a boatload of
Category 2s arrived in Cardiff last night?

40:42.280 --> 40:45.279
One of those cruise ships
full of British citizens from abroad.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.399
- All sick as dogs?
- Hell of a state.

40:47.520 --> 40:51.839
- Expelled from Europe like boat people.
- Last thing we need is more patients.

40:51.960 --> 40:54.599
Come on, we've got to get these
Cat 1 s ready for transport.

40:56.760 --> 40:59.399
All right, Dad,
I'm getting you out of here...now.

41:53.760 --> 41:54.999
Bless you.

42:01.200 --> 42:02.519
Where the hell were you?!

42:02.640 --> 42:05.399
I was on time,
only this officious bastard held me up.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.119
Why didn't you just
run him over or something?

42:07.240 --> 42:08.999
I'm not the running-over type, Gwen,
you know that.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.039
Anyway, I drove off when
the silly bugger was on the phone.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.999
- He's probably followed me.
- One, two, three.

42:18.680 --> 42:20.999
OK, let's get him. Gently now.

42:21.120 --> 42:25.319
- OK, I got you.
- Ready, one, two, three. OK.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.959
Get going, then. Take Dad home.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.199
There's something I've got to do here
first before I go to the States.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.239
You're going back to America?

42:35.360 --> 42:37.479
We've got to find out what's behind
all of this and put a stop to it,

42:37.600 --> 42:41.079
once and for all. But before I do,
I haven't finished with this place yet.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.119
That's him! That's him! That's him!

42:44.240 --> 42:47.399
Hey, hey, hey! Where's my goodbye kiss,
you big fool?

42:52.440 --> 42:55.159
- Bye...
- Get going.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.319
Now, you hold it right there!

43:00.600 --> 43:01.799
Get me the south gate.

43:06.080 --> 43:07.439
Here we go.

43:08.520 --> 43:09.479
MAN: Hey, you!

43:09.600 --> 43:11.559
Hey!

43:18.240 --> 43:20.559
- Fire!
- (GUNFIRE)

43:32.240 --> 43:33.919
I just hope someone's listening.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.319
COMPUTER: Hello. Anybody home?

43:57.320 --> 44:00.039
You're a sight for sore eyes.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.239
Jack, is that you?

44:03.360 --> 44:06.399
In the flesh. You OK?

44:06.520 --> 44:08.119
Yes...

44:10.200 --> 44:13.799
I know, Jack. I'll be there soon.
I'm coming back to the fight.

44:13.920 --> 44:16.559
- To the fight.
- We need you.

44:16.680 --> 44:19.399
But first, there's something
I've got to show you.

44:20.800 --> 44:24.359
Record it for me, Jack.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.319
Oh, lovely.

44:52.560 --> 44:54.919
Jack, you watching?

44:55.040 --> 44:56.719
I'm here.

44:56.840 --> 45:00.559
And I've opened up the radio link.
Make your message.

45:00.680 --> 45:04.119
This is the truth
for the whole world to see.

45:04.240 --> 45:07.959
We let our governments
build concentration camps.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.799
They built ovens for people in our names.

45:10.920 --> 45:13.479
Now, I don't care
if the whole of society bends over

45:13.600 --> 45:16.559
and takes this like a dog,
I'm saying, "No."

45:31.560 --> 45:32.519
That's my girl.

45:44.520 --> 45:46.279
(SIRENS WAIL)

45:51.320 --> 45:55.239
Well, all the guards are gone.
The regular army is coming in.

45:55.360 --> 45:57.319
They'll shut it down.

45:57.440 --> 46:01.599
It was sanctioned...
by the government...

46:03.080 --> 46:04.079
...and they've got my name.

46:05.560 --> 46:08.679
They've got my name.
I was on staff as Esther Drummond.

46:08.800 --> 46:12.119
Esther, listen, stop it, OK?
Just stop it. You saved me.

46:15.720 --> 46:18.679
I spent all that time
wanting a job like yours.

46:20.400 --> 46:21.559
Look at me now.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.079
OK.

46:24.120 --> 46:27.319
It's OK, you...
you're allowed to feel like this.

46:27.440 --> 46:28.759
Come here.

46:34.440 --> 46:35.639
Listen to me.

46:35.760 --> 46:38.679
This is not over, not for Torchwood.

46:38.800 --> 46:41.399
And I need you in this fight.

46:41.520 --> 46:42.719
OK.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.239
So get it together and do it fast.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.199
OK.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.799
I'm fine. I'm...

46:49.920 --> 46:51.479
I'm ready.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.599
Yeah. (GRUNTS)

46:56.120 --> 46:57.559
Me too.

47:03.560 --> 47:07.199
TV: Flesh can burn. That's
the stark truth facing the world today.

47:07.320 --> 47:10.399
We've known since Miracle Day
that flesh can still burn.

47:10.520 --> 47:12.119
But today there's outrage...

47:12.240 --> 47:15.839
We did it. We're whistle-blowers.

47:15.960 --> 47:18.639
Every major news organisation.

47:18.760 --> 47:20.439
The world knows the truth now.

47:20.560 --> 47:21.999
Let the outrage begin.

47:22.120 --> 47:24.159
You really think it's that easy, huh?

47:26.760 --> 47:29.919
The death of Vera Juarez
demands a full investigation,

47:30.040 --> 47:33.719
but there will be no apology
for the Category 1 process. Now,

47:33.840 --> 47:36.199
we exist in a permanent
state of emergency.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.399
The White House stands by
our disaster response

47:39.520 --> 47:42.199
as...as appropriate
and as sanctioned by Congress.

47:42.320 --> 47:45.719
This is exactly what we would do
in times of a famine

47:45.840 --> 47:48.159
- or a plague or pestilence...
- REX: You see that?

47:48.280 --> 47:51.799
They should be shutting down those camps
right now. They're just talking about it.

47:51.920 --> 47:54.039
At least we've made it public.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.039
Torchwood wasn't designed
to fight politicians.

47:57.160 --> 47:59.519
If we really want to stop this happening,

47:59.640 --> 48:01.719
we need to look at the bigger picture,

48:01.840 --> 48:03.399
find out what the Blessing is.

48:11.200 --> 48:13.439
RHYS: Hello, I'm not available,

48:13.560 --> 48:16.319
but please leave your name and number,
and I'll call you back as soon as I can.

48:16.440 --> 48:18.239
- (SIGHS)
- Thank you!

48:18.360 --> 48:22.559
Rhys, it's me again.
Um, I've landed. I'm back in LA.

48:22.680 --> 48:24.639
Where are you, you bloody fool?

48:24.760 --> 48:27.159
Why aren't you picking up the phone?
Call me back.

48:27.280 --> 48:30.039
LOUD SPEAKER: Gwen Cooper
to the white courtesy phone.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.719
Gwen Cooper, you have a call.

48:33.560 --> 48:37.439
Gwen Cooper to the white courtesy phone.
Gwen Cooper, you have a call.

48:39.520 --> 48:41.119
This is Gwen Cooper.

48:42.680 --> 48:45.159
Hello, this is Gwen Cooper.
You said I had a message.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.679
MAN: Lenses.

48:48.800 --> 48:50.319
What? What did you just say?

48:54.280 --> 48:55.599
Lenses.

49:29.960 --> 49:30.959
Who...

49:33.920 --> 49:35.479
Who are...

49:35.600 --> 49:37.599
Who are you?

49:39.320 --> 49:41.079
What do you want?

49:41.200 --> 49:42.759
(SHOUTS) What do you want?!

49:57.760 --> 50:00.319
Why am I tied down?

50:00.440 --> 50:02.039
Somebody's taken Anwen, Rhys, my mother,

50:02.160 --> 50:05.199
the whole bloody family. They said if I
bring you, they'll let them go unharmed.

50:05.320 --> 50:07.599
They want to kill you,
but why do they want to do that?

50:07.720 --> 50:08.839
I don't know.

50:08.960 --> 50:10.399
Well, you've done something, haven't you?
Way back when

50:10.520 --> 50:11.959
in that long bloody life of yours!

50:12.080 --> 50:14.199
Now, you think. Think!

50:14.320 --> 50:15.959
Harkness! I'm looking for

50:16.080 --> 50:17.239
Jack Harkness!

50:17.360 --> 50:19.039
That's me!

50:19.160 --> 50:22.199
- Welcome to America, Mr Harkness.
- Thank you very much, Inspector.

50:22.320 --> 50:24.119
Hey, wait! Stop that man!

50:36.840 --> 50:38.319
MAN: Where are you from?

50:38.440 --> 50:41.119
JACK: A magical island called Torchwood.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.279
Whatever you do,
don't look in the box.

50:45.240 --> 50:48.159
Because I know exactly what you're
thinking, Jack Harkness. I know it.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.599
This is about my daughter.

50:50.840 --> 50:54.199
And I swear, for her sake,
I will see you killed.
