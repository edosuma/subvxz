26:02.093 --> 26:02.928

26:02.994 --> 26:03.862

26:05.497 --> 26:06.898
YOU KNOW, AND SO I TRIED COMING

26:06.965 --> 26:07.632
OUT TO MY MOM, AND SO I PULLED

26:07.699 --> 26:08.667
HER INTO MY BEDROOM.

26:08.733 --> 26:09.935
I WAS LIKE, MOM, I GOT SOMETHING

26:10.001 --> 26:11.469

26:14.472 --> 26:20.011
AND THEN SHE'S LIKE, OKAY.

26:20.078 --> 26:20.679
SHE ACTED TOTALLY COOL, AND THEN

26:20.745 --> 26:21.313
SHE DID NOT TALK TO ME FOR THREE

26:21.379 --> 26:23.848
DAYS.

26:23.915 --> 26:24.983
AND I REMEMBER FEELING THAT

26:25.050 --> 26:25.984
FEELING OF LIKE, I CAN'T LOSE MY

26:26.051 --> 26:27.352
MOM, I CAN'T LOSE MY MOM.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.021
I WAS DEVASTATED.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.724
AND THEN A COUPLE YEARS PASSED,

26:32.791 --> 26:33.558
I THINK I WAS 17 AT THE TIME, MY

26:33.625 --> 26:35.160
BROTHER AND MY DAD ARE IN MY CAR

26:35.226 --> 26:37.929

26:47.639 --> 26:48.173
>> MY BROTHER'S LAUGHING, HE'S

26:48.239 --> 26:49.674
LIKE, DAD KNOWS.

26:49.741 --> 26:51.476
HE FOUND OUT TODAY, LIKE DAD

26:51.543 --> 26:53.111
WENT OFF ROADING IN YOUR CAR.

26:53.178 --> 26:53.878
AND MY MOM WAS LIKE, YOUR

26:53.945 --> 26:55.547
BROTHER DECIDED TO TELL YOUR DAD

26:55.613 --> 26:57.983
THAT YOU WERE GAY, MY DAD WAS

26:58.049 --> 26:59.150
ENRAGED, HE WAS SO -- HE WAS

26:59.217 --> 27:02.053
MORE ENRAGED THAN I EVER HAD

27:02.120 --> 27:02.554
SEEN THAT MAN, AND I WAS

27:02.620 --> 27:02.854
TERRIFIED.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.823
>> Shangela: WOW.

27:04.889 --> 27:07.592
>> HE COMES OUTSIDE AND HE'S

27:07.659 --> 27:08.693
LIKE, MIJO, IT'S GONNA BE A VERY

27:08.760 --> 27:11.796
CHALLENGING LIFE FOR YOU.

27:11.863 --> 27:13.965
SO, AS HE'S EXPLAINING HIMSELF

27:14.032 --> 27:15.700
TO ME, I COME TO FIND OUT THAT

27:15.767 --> 27:18.603
HE LOST TWO OF HIS COUSINS

27:18.670 --> 27:21.773
BECAUSE OF LGBT ISSUES.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.675
ONE OF OUR FIRST COUSINS THAT HE

27:23.742 --> 27:24.342
KNEW THAT PASSED AWAY WAS DUE TO

27:24.409 --> 27:26.344
HIV.

27:26.411 --> 27:27.545
AND THE SECOND COUSIN THAT HE

27:27.612 --> 27:29.814
LOST WAS TO SUICIDE.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.816
AND SO MY DAD JUST WAS LIKE,

27:31.883 --> 27:33.018
DON'T COMMIT SUICIDE, YOU KNOW,

27:33.084 --> 27:34.085
BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE

27:34.152 --> 27:36.054
HAVING SEX, YOU KNOW.

27:36.121 --> 27:37.222
AND I'M LOOKING AT HIM LIKE,

27:37.288 --> 27:37.856
THIS IS NOT THE REACTION I'M

27:37.922 --> 27:40.925
EXPECTING.

27:40.992 --> 27:44.629
ANOTHER YEAR PASSED AND I

27:44.696 --> 27:45.196
GRADUATED EARLY, I GRADUATED

27:45.263 --> 27:45.864
ON MY 18th BIRTHDAY.

27:45.930 --> 27:47.198
SO I MOVED TO TULSA, OKLAHOMA,

27:47.265 --> 27:51.669
AND ONE NIGHT I GOT REALLY SICK

27:51.736 --> 27:52.771
DRINKING WITH MY FRIENDS, YOU

27:52.837 --> 27:54.072
KNOW, AND I WOKE UP AND I WAS

27:54.139 --> 27:54.639
BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THE

27:54.706 --> 27:55.607
NEXT MORNING.

27:55.673 --> 27:56.541
I WAS LIKE, STOP.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.410
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

27:58.476 --> 27:59.044
THIS IS NOT MY MOMENT, THIS IS

27:59.110 --> 28:02.447
NOT MY TIME, LIKE, I'M A VIRGIN.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.884
AND THAT MOMENT SHOOK ME.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.752
EVERYTHING THAT MY DAD WARNED ME

28:07.819 --> 28:10.755
ABOUT, I JUST EXPERIENCED AND I

28:10.822 --> 28:14.759
MADE HIS TRUTH COME TO FRUITION.

28:14.826 --> 28:16.461
SO I WENT HOME TO TEXAS AND I

28:16.528 --> 28:20.031
TOLD MY PARENTS.

28:20.098 --> 28:20.632
AND MY DAD AND MY MOM WERE SO

28:20.698 --> 28:23.802
SUPPORTIVE.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.303
THEY EMBRACED THEIR CHILD THAT

28:25.370 --> 28:27.972
HAD EXPERIENCED TRAUMA AND IT

28:28.039 --> 28:29.107
WAS LIKE, STEP ONE OF LIKE,

28:29.174 --> 28:32.677
