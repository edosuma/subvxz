Come on, guys.

00:12.018 --> 00:13.225
Come on, kick it, Milo!

00:15.768 --> 00:18.267
Go, go! Go! Oh!

00:19.309 --> 00:21.143
(LAUGHING)

00:27.684 --> 00:29.350
A little help, honey?

00:29.350 --> 00:30.350
Sure.

00:35.851 --> 00:37.517
I got it! I got him!

-I got him! I got him!

Go, Milo!

-Yes!

-Yay!

00:56.934 --> 00:59.185
-You're next, Annie!
-No, I am not next.

00:59.185 --> 01:02.185
You're not allowed to
throw me into the goal. No.

01:02.185 --> 01:03.351
No.

01:08.477 --> 01:10.143
I hope we got all that.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.351
(PANTING)

01:17.351 --> 01:18.727
Last day of summer.

01:18.727 --> 01:20.852
Anything else to say
before I turn this off?

01:20.852 --> 01:23.351
Just that this has been
the best day of my life.

01:24.226 --> 01:25.602
You say that every day.

01:25.602 --> 01:28.060
'Cause it's true.

01:28.060 --> 01:31.852
You are seriously
the cheesiest person
I have ever met.

01:31.852 --> 01:33.560
And that's why you love me.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.101
I know.

01:35.101 --> 01:37.393
-(CAMERA BEEPS)
-Oh, battery's dying.

01:37.393 --> 01:38.560

Bye.

01:40.518 --> 01:42.310
(BEEPS)

01:42.310 --> 01:44.019
I guess we should pack up.

01:44.019 --> 01:46.268
If you don't mind,
I'm going to take the boat out
one more time.

01:46.268 --> 01:48.310
Okay. I'll see you at home.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.518
-Love you.
-I love you.

02:10.061 --> 02:12.478
Mommy, could I have
a cookie now?

02:12.478 --> 02:15.186
Not until your Dad gets back
from sailing, okay?

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

02:23.269 --> 02:25.311
Hey, it's me.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.769
I just put the kids to bed.

02:27.769 --> 02:31.102
It's getting late and
I'm worried about this storm.
Where are you?

(PHONE RINGING)

02:38.852 --> 02:40.227

(SOBBING)

02:56.436 --> 02:57.436
No.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.770
Mom, the cookies are burning!

03:08.770 --> 03:10.062
What? Oh, no!

03:10.686 --> 03:11.895
Oh, shoot!

03:14.978 --> 03:17.561
Oh, no. Shoot!

03:17.561 --> 03:18.936
Oh, my gosh.

03:21.436 --> 03:22.978
Great.

03:22.978 --> 03:24.561
Now I'm a batch behind.

(SIGHS)

03:27.103 --> 03:28.895
What?

03:28.895 --> 03:30.895
-Nothing.
-Oh...

03:30.895 --> 03:33.603
I promised I would take
you and Maddy to the mall,
didn't I?

03:35.728 --> 03:37.853
Okay. Okay, no,
I can make this work.

03:38.603 --> 03:39.978
Okay.

03:39.978 --> 03:42.437
You know,
Maddy just texted me.

03:42.437 --> 03:44.020
She said she can't make it.

03:44.020 --> 03:46.270
Really?

03:46.270 --> 03:49.353
Okay, well, maybe you could
have her come over and
just kick the ball around?

03:49.353 --> 03:51.562
Soccer tryouts are
next week, aren't they?

03:51.562 --> 03:53.103
I don't know.
I'm not trying out.

03:54.062 --> 03:55.228
You're not?

03:55.228 --> 03:56.687
I thought you changed
your mind.

03:57.811 --> 03:59.604
I bought you those cleats.

03:59.604 --> 04:01.353
I don't need them.

04:01.353 --> 04:04.729
Maybe you could spend
the money on, let's see...

04:04.729 --> 04:06.687
Tickets to ComicFest?

04:06.687 --> 04:09.562
Oh, sweetie, not this again.

04:09.562 --> 04:12.228
Well, tickets just went
on sale like five minutes ago.

04:12.228 --> 04:13.604
If we don't hurry,
it'll be like...

04:13.604 --> 04:16.394
I told you, you're not going
until you're older.

04:16.394 --> 04:18.394
Technically, I'm older than
the last time I asked.

04:21.187 --> 04:22.729
Not quite yet.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.729
Okay, okay.

04:25.729 --> 04:28.645
Hey, since you're staying,
do you think I could
get some help?

04:28.645 --> 04:30.270
I'm so far behind.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.228
Please.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.312
(SIGHS)

04:35.063 --> 04:37.562
Come on, you used
to love baking with me.

04:37.562 --> 04:39.104
You used to love baking.

04:44.271 --> 04:45.687
MILO: I'm hungry.

04:45.687 --> 04:47.313
I know. We'll stop
and get something to eat

04:47.313 --> 04:48.771
as soon as I drop these off.

04:48.771 --> 04:50.229
Or I can have a cookie.

04:50.229 --> 04:52.438
Uh, no, sweetie,
these are for work.

04:53.812 --> 04:55.687
Daddy would've let me
sneak a cookie.

04:55.687 --> 04:57.896
Dad would've taken me
to ComicFest.

04:57.896 --> 04:59.812
I know.
I wish he were here too.

05:00.937 --> 05:03.687
Can we go to the beach
on the way, Mom?

05:03.687 --> 05:05.605
No, I really have to do
this for work, sweetie.

05:05.605 --> 05:07.979
There's not enough time.

05:07.979 --> 05:11.480
Come on, it's on the way,
just five minutes.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.104
Please? Please?

05:14.979 --> 05:16.688
Okay.

05:16.688 --> 05:18.646
Real quick. Okay.

05:18.646 --> 05:20.480
Let's get this up, guys.
(GRUNTS)

05:20.480 --> 05:21.772
Yes! In you go.

05:36.646 --> 05:38.730
Daddy loved it here.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.480
I loved it here, too.

05:41.772 --> 05:43.855
I can't believe
it's been two years.

05:43.855 --> 05:46.396
Can we watch the video?

05:46.396 --> 05:48.813
Sweetie, there's not
really time.
We have to get going.

05:48.813 --> 05:51.980
But Mom, I want to see Dad.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.772
Okay.

05:57.897 --> 05:59.396
(ALL LAUGHING)

06:05.230 --> 06:08.688

the best day of my life.

06:10.189 --> 06:12.105

I've ever met.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.355

you love me.

06:17.230 --> 06:18.605
I miss him.

06:19.439 --> 06:20.772
I miss him, too.

06:20.772 --> 06:22.272
-Say goodbye to summer.
-Bye.

06:24.938 --> 06:25.938
Come on.

06:30.647 --> 06:32.855
-Mom.
-Yeah, sweetheart?

06:32.855 --> 06:34.855
How could you let me
have hair so stupid?

06:34.855 --> 06:37.064
(CHUCKLES)

06:37.064 --> 06:40.355
You mean the "I have to have
this hairstyle or I'm never
speaking to you again" hair?

I'm so sorry.

no, no, no, no!

06:56.481 --> 06:58.314
What do all
of those lights mean?

06:58.314 --> 07:00.105
It means we have
to call a cab.

07:00.105 --> 07:01.814
Can I go collect some rocks?

07:01.814 --> 07:04.064
Five minutes. Stay where
I can see you, okay?

07:04.064 --> 07:05.189
-Okay.
-(ENGINE CRANKING)

07:10.065 --> 07:11.189

07:11.189 --> 07:13.731

07:15.148 --> 07:17.230
WOMAN:
Everyone is here, James.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.606
What kind of host arrives
late to his own party?

07:19.606 --> 07:22.397
The kind that doesn't
care about...

07:30.190 --> 07:31.481
ANNIE: Are you okay?

07:32.439 --> 07:33.898
Are you all right?

07:33.898 --> 07:35.856
What's the matter with you?
What were you thinking?

07:35.856 --> 07:38.773
I'm so sorry. You must've
been in my blind spot.

07:38.773 --> 07:40.814
We were right behind you.
That's not a blind spot,

07:40.814 --> 07:43.981
that's a "pretty sure you were
on your cell phone" spot.

07:43.981 --> 07:45.647
Technically, yes
I was on my phone,

07:45.647 --> 07:48.356
but I was on a speakerphone,
so totally legal.

07:48.356 --> 07:50.190
-So you're a lawyer.
-No.

07:50.190 --> 07:51.731
No, not a lawyer.

07:51.731 --> 07:53.273
Okay. Well, it doesn't matter.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.273
All right. You should just be
more careful next time.

07:55.273 --> 07:56.939
-Yeah. You could've killed us.
-Yeah.

07:56.939 --> 07:58.023
Yeah.

07:58.023 --> 07:59.356
Well, I'm glad I didn't,

07:59.356 --> 08:01.440
and I'm glad
that you're all okay.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.482
Well, we are. Unfortunately...

08:03.482 --> 08:06.273
Yeah.
What exactly is all this?

08:06.273 --> 08:08.815
It's an entire day's pay,
that's what it is.

08:08.815 --> 08:10.815
Well, let me cover
the cost of that, please.

08:10.815 --> 08:13.023
No, thank you.
I don't want your money.

08:13.023 --> 08:14.148
(CHUCKLES)

08:14.690 --> 08:16.273
What?

08:16.273 --> 08:18.148
Nothing, I just, uh...

08:19.315 --> 08:20.857
I don't hear that very often.

08:20.857 --> 08:23.356
ANNIE: Well,
you're hearing it now.

08:23.356 --> 08:24.982
You need to be more careful.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.899
-There are a lot
of kids around here.
-JAMES: You're right.

08:27.565 --> 08:28.815
Want one?

08:28.815 --> 08:30.732
Mom makes a lot
of fancy stuff,

08:30.732 --> 08:33.648
but her cookies are
the best in the whole world.

08:33.648 --> 08:35.482
And this one didn't even
touch the ground.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.482
Well, thank you
very much, young man.

08:38.482 --> 08:41.440
Would you at least let me
drive you to wherever
you wanna go?

08:41.440 --> 08:42.648
This is our cab.

08:42.648 --> 08:44.149
Well, let me cover
the cost of the cab.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.066
-No, thank you.
-I insist.

08:51.857 --> 08:52.899
Okay.

08:55.732 --> 08:57.774
This is for the fare.

08:57.774 --> 08:59.648
Thanks, but no thanks.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.149
Really? Okay.

09:12.690 --> 09:13.899
(CHUCKLES)

09:25.274 --> 09:27.066
Whoa!

09:27.066 --> 09:28.940
Is this where Batman lives?

09:33.066 --> 09:34.566
-Hi, Ericka.
-Hi.

09:37.191 --> 09:41.107
Milo, Ella, there is a room
at the end of the hall

09:41.107 --> 09:42.900
with a fully-loaded Xbox.

09:42.900 --> 09:45.441
And I'll bring you guys
something to eat in
a few minutes, okay?

09:45.441 --> 09:46.691
Sweet!

09:46.691 --> 09:48.232
Can't I just stay in here?

09:48.232 --> 09:50.858
Just give me and your mom
a few minutes. Okay, sweetie?

09:52.900 --> 09:54.941
Come on, Milo, I'll kick
your butt at the dancing game.

09:54.941 --> 09:56.566
MILO: You said a bad word!

09:56.566 --> 09:57.983
It's only a bad word
if you're seven.

09:57.983 --> 09:59.900
Cool. Then I'll say it
when I'm eight!

10:01.232 --> 10:02.483
Hey.

10:03.649 --> 10:05.108
What happened?

10:05.108 --> 10:07.108
We stopped at the beach,
and then the car
wouldn't start,

10:07.108 --> 10:10.192
and then some rich guy
almost hit us with his
gazillion-dollar car.

10:10.983 --> 10:13.358
(MUSIC PLAYING)

10:13.358 --> 10:15.441
WOMAN: James, I thought
you'd never arrive.

10:15.441 --> 10:16.524
Mother.

10:17.775 --> 10:20.108
I want to introduce you
to a new friend of mine.

10:20.108 --> 10:21.608
Oh, you're on a date?
That's great!

10:21.608 --> 10:23.192
Does that mean I'm going
to have a new daddy?

10:23.192 --> 10:25.317
(CHUCKLES)
Don't be ridiculous, James.

10:25.317 --> 10:26.858
-She's for you.
-Oh.

10:26.858 --> 10:28.358
Her name is Susan Slater.

10:28.358 --> 10:30.317
She went to Sarah Lawrence
and she's perfect.

10:30.317 --> 10:31.900
Is this someone
you actually know?

10:31.900 --> 10:33.775
I know of her, close enough.

10:33.775 --> 10:35.816
Mother, for the last time,

10:35.816 --> 10:38.525
I don't need your help
finding a girlfriend.

10:38.525 --> 10:40.650
No, just finding a wife.

10:40.650 --> 10:42.692
I'm just trying to
help you stop traipsing

10:42.692 --> 10:44.442
around the world
and settle down.

10:44.442 --> 10:45.983
I very seldom traipse, Mother.

10:45.983 --> 10:47.358
You know what I mean, James.

10:47.358 --> 10:48.692
I'm more of
a gallivantor, really.

10:48.692 --> 10:51.484
(CHUCKLING)
Stop trying to be cute, James.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.609
You need to think
about your future.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.317
Financially,
I'm doing just fine.

10:55.317 --> 10:57.108
You know what I mean.

10:57.108 --> 11:00.067
Look, in two weeks,
I'm going to Hong Kong.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.609
After that, Paris.

11:01.609 --> 11:03.983
That's as much future
as I can handle right now.

11:03.983 --> 11:06.317
Well, I'm just saying
I want to be a grandmother

11:06.317 --> 11:09.525
-before I actually look old
enough to be a grandmother.
-(CHUCKLES)

11:09.525 --> 11:11.525
-Pre-laser, of course.
-I'm sorry,

11:11.525 --> 11:13.650
but the women I meet,
they're all the same.

11:14.525 --> 11:17.525
Oh, give Susan a chance.

11:17.525 --> 11:19.776
You never know
when love might strike.

11:20.692 --> 11:22.776
Susan.

11:22.776 --> 11:25.151
I'd like to introduce you
to my son, James.

11:25.151 --> 11:27.400
James, this is Susan Slater.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.942
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Hey.

11:28.942 --> 11:30.984
Your mom told me that
you just got back
from Istanbul.

11:30.984 --> 11:33.109
-Uh, yes.
-And you were in Moscow also?

11:33.109 --> 11:34.567
I travel a little.

11:34.567 --> 11:36.318
Oh, and by the way,

11:36.318 --> 11:38.901
I could not help but notice
the Kandinsky in the foyer.

11:39.817 --> 11:41.442
You have great taste.

11:41.442 --> 11:44.692
-She knows her art.
-Yeah, I heard, Mother.
Thank you.

11:44.692 --> 11:47.234
I know when
something's extraordinary.

11:47.234 --> 11:51.109
Well, I'll just leave you two
to get better acquainted.

11:51.109 --> 11:53.901
-Thank you, Mother.
-Mmm-hmm.

11:53.901 --> 11:55.568
-(EXHALES) Well...
-SERVER: Wine?

11:55.568 --> 11:58.193
Oh, yes please.
Thank you very much.
(CLEARS THROAT)

11:58.193 --> 11:59.401
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

12:00.776 --> 12:02.234
So what do you do?

12:02.234 --> 12:03.776
I'm a lifestyle blogger.

12:03.776 --> 12:05.026
Sorry. You're a what?

12:05.026 --> 12:07.443
I get paid to write
about things I love.

12:07.443 --> 12:10.693

clothes, cars, travel.

12:10.693 --> 12:13.942
And of course with my job,
I'm pretty much free
to travel anywhere.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.234
-Hmm.
-Just like you.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.735
Good to know. Yeah.

12:19.735 --> 12:20.902
Oh, oh...

12:20.902 --> 12:22.942
-Can you hold this for a sec?
-Okay.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.068
Just a little higher.

12:24.902 --> 12:26.360
Perfect.

-Oh. (LAUGHS)
-(CHUCKLES)

12:32.068 --> 12:33.193
-That's funny.
-Yeah.

12:33.193 --> 12:34.777
Yeah.

12:34.777 --> 12:38.610
Oh, look, um, there's
a friend of mine, Nate,
from Princeton.

12:38.610 --> 12:40.443
I should probably
go talk to him.

12:40.443 --> 12:41.985
Sorry, it was
nice meeting you.
Okay, bye.

12:41.985 --> 12:43.526
Excuse me. Gotta go.

12:46.902 --> 12:48.568
I'm so sorry.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.735
What are we going
to do for desserts?

12:50.735 --> 12:52.069
You'll figure out something.

12:52.069 --> 12:53.235
I don't know.

12:53.235 --> 12:55.526
Annie, being creative,
improvising,

12:55.526 --> 12:57.401
-that used to be
your calling card.
-(SIGHS)

12:57.401 --> 12:59.818
Come on.
The pantry's right here.

12:59.818 --> 13:01.818
Think of this as a chance
to make something new.

13:01.818 --> 13:03.902
-Expand the menu.
-What menu?

13:03.902 --> 13:06.444
For your bakery, of course.

13:06.444 --> 13:10.069
Ericka, I told you,
that's not going to happen.

13:10.069 --> 13:11.235
Not anymore.

13:11.235 --> 13:12.693
(SIGHS) Annie.

13:12.693 --> 13:15.360
Well, this pantry
is practically empty.

13:15.360 --> 13:18.486
What does this guy do,
eat every meal
at a restaurant?

13:18.486 --> 13:20.611
JAMES: Yes. Actually, he does.

13:24.777 --> 13:28.402
Wait. This was the party
you were coming to?

13:28.402 --> 13:31.027
Those pastries
were for this party. Yes.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.818
Yes.

13:32.818 --> 13:35.778
Before they became gourmet,
intricately-decorated
roadkill.

13:35.778 --> 13:38.985
And I'm so sorry
about that. Really.

13:38.985 --> 13:42.444
But I'm not sorry
that I get a chance
to see you again,

13:42.444 --> 13:44.736
so I can say sorry, again.

13:44.736 --> 13:45.985
So, um...

13:46.652 --> 13:48.152
-Sorry?
-Sorry.

13:48.152 --> 13:49.319
Yes. (CHUCKLES)

13:50.152 --> 13:51.944
Oh, and um...

13:51.944 --> 13:53.277
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:53.277 --> 13:54.652
-Yeah.
-No. Nice try.

13:55.069 --> 13:56.402
Really?

13:57.569 --> 13:58.569
Oh.

14:00.319 --> 14:01.986
This one's okay.

14:01.986 --> 14:03.861
Yes. That's one
of the few survivors.

14:03.861 --> 14:06.736
Might as well take a bite,
see what you missed.

14:06.736 --> 14:07.819
-Really?
-Hmm.

14:07.819 --> 14:08.903
Okay.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.986
-Mmm.
-See, don't you feel
terrible now?

14:14.986 --> 14:16.652
(MOANING)

14:16.652 --> 14:18.028
I really do.

14:18.944 --> 14:20.444
Wow. Your son was right.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.195
This is the best cookie
I've ever had.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.861
I'm going to keep
all of these for myself.

14:23.861 --> 14:25.444
Even the ones with the gravel.

14:25.444 --> 14:26.819
Mmm, fiber.

14:26.819 --> 14:28.819
I'm sorry, but they're
not yours to keep.

14:28.819 --> 14:31.320
They belong to the guy
whose party this is.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.569
James Braddock III,

14:33.569 --> 14:36.528
which sounds like a made-up
TV name, but whatever.

14:36.528 --> 14:37.986
Really?

14:37.986 --> 14:39.236
Um, Annie...

14:41.111 --> 14:43.612
It's a real name.
It's my name.

14:43.612 --> 14:45.986
My house, my kitchen,
my empty pantry.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.278
Why didn't you say something?

14:49.278 --> 14:50.944
I just walked in.

14:50.944 --> 14:52.278
Why didn't you say something?

14:52.944 --> 14:54.278
You didn't ask.

14:54.986 --> 14:57.612
(JAMES CHUCKLES)

14:57.612 --> 15:00.695
Okay, so now that
you know who I am,

15:00.695 --> 15:02.779
and you're still not gonna
let me pay for the cab,

15:02.779 --> 15:05.487
would you at least let me pay
for the pastries?

15:05.487 --> 15:07.195
No, it feels like pity money.

15:07.195 --> 15:09.236
Pity money?
It's not pity money.

15:09.236 --> 15:12.528
I want them, they're amazing,
broken ones and all.

15:12.528 --> 15:14.570
I know you're not
really going to eat them.

15:14.570 --> 15:16.570
And why would that be?

15:16.570 --> 15:18.487
Because you probably have
a personal trainer

15:18.487 --> 15:21.570
who won't let you get
within 10 feet of a carb.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.278
I love carbs.

15:23.278 --> 15:24.820
And gluten!

15:24.820 --> 15:26.071
Shh!

15:26.071 --> 15:27.862
What will people think?

15:27.862 --> 15:30.779
Come here. I want to
show you something.
You're gonna love this.

15:30.779 --> 15:34.570
Now, I may have just
a wee bit of a sweet tooth.

15:34.570 --> 15:35.779
(ANNIE GASPS)

15:35.779 --> 15:38.779
-Are these Grammy Bars?
-Yeah.

15:38.779 --> 15:42.029
I thought they discontinued
these like 20 years ago.

15:42.029 --> 15:44.029
-Man, I used to love these.
-That's impossible.

15:44.029 --> 15:45.362
I'm the only one
that loved them.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.196
That's why they stopped
making them.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.071
How do you have these?

15:49.071 --> 15:50.779
I got a guy.

15:50.779 --> 15:53.904
You have
a discontinued candy guy?

15:53.904 --> 15:55.112
Doesn't everyone?

15:56.404 --> 15:59.862
Do you by any chance
have a rosemary guy too?

16:02.362 --> 16:03.362
Better.

16:06.362 --> 16:08.154
-This is beautiful.
-Yeah.

16:08.154 --> 16:10.862
I like to come in here
to get away from everything,
you know?

16:10.862 --> 16:12.654
Why would you want
to get away from any of this?

16:12.654 --> 16:14.279
Come on, rosemary is out here.

16:14.279 --> 16:15.987
Oh, you do have
a rosemary guy.

16:15.987 --> 16:17.446
Yes, I do.

16:18.362 --> 16:19.529
It's lovely.

16:20.904 --> 16:23.029
Yes, it is.

16:23.029 --> 16:24.821

-Yeah?

(CLEARS THROAT)

16:29.321 --> 16:31.279
You know, you really
don't have to do this.

16:31.279 --> 16:32.529
Those people have
had so much to drink,

16:32.529 --> 16:34.321
you could serve them
dollar-store donut holes

16:34.321 --> 16:35.946
and they'd never
know the difference.

16:36.905 --> 16:38.821
Well, I would.

16:38.821 --> 16:41.988
Well, yeah. Uh, I'm sorry.
(CHUCKLES)

16:41.988 --> 16:44.863
I didn't mean to insult you.
I meant to insult them.

16:44.863 --> 16:48.654
Sometimes it's just
a little too much, uh, show.

16:48.654 --> 16:50.488
You know?

16:50.488 --> 16:52.155
If you hate
being around these people
then why have a party at all?

16:53.155 --> 16:55.613
Raising money for charity.

16:55.613 --> 16:59.821
But, uh, it's always
the same conversation,
just a different house.

16:59.821 --> 17:03.238
Except maybe this time,
a little different.

17:05.445 --> 17:07.238
Well, I better get started
on dessert.

-Okay.

Please?

17:13.863 --> 17:17.489
Okay, hotshot, so where does
the rosemary come in?

17:17.489 --> 17:19.988
Well, I'm making
dark chocolate-covered
s'more cookies,

17:19.988 --> 17:23.071
and the rosemary gives
it a hint of campfire.

17:23.071 --> 17:24.780
-Get out of here.
-It does.

17:24.780 --> 17:26.196
-Hey!
-I just wanna try.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.363
Mmm. Oh, that's good.

17:30.363 --> 17:32.363
-Really good.
-Thank you.

17:32.363 --> 17:34.322

any more baking sheets?

17:34.322 --> 17:35.655
-This...
-Um, oh...

17:36.530 --> 17:39.363

-You know what
you need, James?
-Hmm?

17:40.530 --> 17:42.614
You need to marry
someone who can cook.

17:42.614 --> 17:44.405
Did my mother
pay you to say that?

17:44.405 --> 17:46.697
No, but is she hiring?
I need the work.

17:46.697 --> 17:49.238
Why, the baking biz
is not making ends meet?

17:49.238 --> 17:50.906

No. No, no, no, no.
Not at all.

I brought it up, right?

-Will this do?

I didn't notice
the ring earlier.

a very lucky man.

18:18.073 --> 18:21.530
I'm not exactly married.

18:21.530 --> 18:24.073
-Oh, well, I thought
with the...
-I was.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.281
Married.

18:27.281 --> 18:28.947
Happily, actually.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.448
That's terrible. I'm sorry.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.906
I should get back to this.

18:37.906 --> 18:40.198
Yes, yes. Um...

18:40.198 --> 18:42.781
I should get back
to the party. Um...

18:42.781 --> 18:47.281
Right, we wouldn't want
you to get in trouble
for mingling with the help.

18:47.281 --> 18:51.947
I just want you to know that
this is the most fun I've had
at a party in years.

worked out great.

and for a while there,

19:14.615 --> 19:15.907
so were you.

Whoa! This is
the best house ever!

19:21.156 --> 19:22.531

Can we please go home now?

to get our car towed.

Oh, didn't James tell you?

19:30.490 --> 19:33.323
He had his car guy
tow it to a local shop.

19:33.323 --> 19:34.656
They've already fixed it.

19:37.531 --> 19:39.782
-I can't afford
to pay him back.
-Annie...

19:39.782 --> 19:42.157
Annie, come on,
he almost hit you.

19:42.157 --> 19:43.157
Take the gesture.

19:44.323 --> 19:45.573
Well, tell him thank you.

19:45.573 --> 19:48.865
Or you could call him
and thank him yourself.

21:52.408 --> 21:54.450
Come back.

21:54.450 --> 21:56.241
(VOICE BREAKING)
Please come back.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.575
Mommy, can I have a pancake
like Daddy used to make?

22:09.575 --> 22:11.992
Of course. You want
raisins for eyes?

22:11.992 --> 22:13.034
Chocolate chips.

22:13.034 --> 22:14.825
Mom, I'm seven.

22:14.825 --> 22:16.825
Yes, you are.

22:16.825 --> 22:18.575
You look so much like
your dad, you know that?

22:19.408 --> 22:21.283
Mom, P-H!

22:21.283 --> 22:24.825
P-H! Pancake heads.
Right. It's coming,
with chocolate chips.

22:24.825 --> 22:26.825
And it's there.

22:30.366 --> 22:31.742
I'm eating my head!

22:31.742 --> 22:34.034
ANNIE: Oh, no,
you're eating your head!

22:36.117 --> 22:38.825
Hey, pancake heads
for breakfast.
You want one too?

22:38.825 --> 22:40.201
I liked it Dad's way.

22:41.034 --> 22:42.575
So did I.

22:47.034 --> 22:48.534
I wish you'd talk to me, Ella.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.617
I talk to you every day.

22:50.617 --> 22:52.825
Like right now,
I'm talking to you.

22:52.825 --> 22:55.201
You know what I mean.

22:55.201 --> 22:57.618
It's just not healthy to keep
things bottled up inside.

22:58.618 --> 23:00.701
Yeah. I know.

23:02.034 --> 23:03.201
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

23:03.201 --> 23:05.242
ERICKA: Hey.

23:05.242 --> 23:07.409
Brought back
your chocolate shaver.

23:11.534 --> 23:13.034
What's going on?

23:13.034 --> 23:15.534
Every time I try to talk
to her, she just runs away.

23:15.534 --> 23:17.910
I don't know how
to get through to her.

23:17.910 --> 23:20.159
She just needs more time.

23:20.159 --> 23:22.826
You're doing everything right.

23:22.826 --> 23:25.076
Then why do I feel
like I'm failing her?

23:25.076 --> 23:26.618
You're not.

23:26.618 --> 23:30.659
You're surviving.
And soon you'll be
living again, and happy.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.701
Like when you were
baking yesterday.

23:33.701 --> 23:37.701
I haven't seen you
enjoy your work that much
in a long time.

23:37.701 --> 23:41.242
Of course, the company
wasn't so bad, right?

23:41.242 --> 23:43.284
Do want a pancake
of your head?

23:43.284 --> 23:44.785
(CHUCKLES)
Don't change the subject.

23:44.785 --> 23:45.993
There is no subject.

23:45.993 --> 23:48.659
There should be a subject.

23:48.659 --> 23:51.659
You haven't had
a "subject" in two years.

23:53.701 --> 23:55.743
(SCOFFS)

23:55.743 --> 23:58.243
You know, it's okay
to enjoy life a little.

23:58.243 --> 24:00.118
Even without Andre.

24:00.118 --> 24:03.452
Ericka, I know this is
hard to understand,

24:03.452 --> 24:05.118
but to me he's still here.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.160
I mean,

24:07.160 --> 24:09.826
it's like I literally
just talked to him.

24:09.826 --> 24:10.826
-And...

24:19.785 --> 24:21.452
(GASPS) My ring!

24:21.452 --> 24:23.035
Yes. James just texted me.

24:23.035 --> 24:25.118
Apparently, you left it
on the kitchen counter.

24:26.118 --> 24:27.910
How could I not realize that?

24:28.785 --> 24:30.118
(SIGHS) What's wrong with me?

24:30.118 --> 24:32.327
(CHUCKLES)
Nothing's wrong with you.

24:32.327 --> 24:33.993
Anyway, he said
he has business nearby

24:33.993 --> 24:36.494
and said he can drop off
the ring on his way home.

24:36.494 --> 24:38.786
Or he could mail it.
Or you could bring it.

24:38.786 --> 24:42.285
Annie, I saw how much fun
you had together.

24:42.285 --> 24:44.869
I've known James for years.
He's a good guy.

24:45.993 --> 24:47.994
Even if it's just as a friend,

24:47.994 --> 24:49.994
it's okay to spend time
with someone new.

24:50.660 --> 24:51.660
But, Andre...

24:53.327 --> 24:56.118
Andre has been gone
for almost two years.

25:02.036 --> 25:05.911
where people who've died
send messages
to their loved ones?

25:07.410 --> 25:10.952
What, like the  Montauk Medium
from TV?

25:10.952 --> 25:13.119
Annie, she has
private investigators

25:13.119 --> 25:15.827
to get the scoop on everyone
before she meets them.

25:15.827 --> 25:17.328
And her hair is ridiculous.

25:17.328 --> 25:20.494
I mean, please tell me you
did not call that scam artist.

25:20.494 --> 25:21.994
Of course not.

25:26.744 --> 25:29.203
But last night I, um...

25:29.203 --> 25:30.994
I thought I heard
Andre's voice.

25:31.702 --> 25:33.786
Oh, Annie.

25:33.786 --> 25:35.536
I know, it's silly.

25:35.536 --> 25:38.744
I think I was just...
I was overtired.

25:38.744 --> 25:41.036
It's natural
to want something bad enough

25:41.036 --> 25:43.661
that you make it real
for yourself.

25:43.661 --> 25:45.203
That's probably what happened.

25:45.203 --> 25:46.952
Yeah.

No.

25:57.203 --> 25:59.203
Um...

you already told him he could?

just dropping off the ring.

I always wanted
to build a rocket ship.

31:04.915 --> 31:06.207
You never did as a kid?

31:06.207 --> 31:09.873
I tried once,
with brand new couch cushions.

31:09.873 --> 31:11.706
And they were white,
so that didn't work out
so well.

31:11.706 --> 31:12.706
Mmm.

31:13.624 --> 31:14.707
I can't believe it.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.624
You were right.

I might have been right.

fan fiction?

-It's true.
-That's very sweet.

-Yes.

Yes, please.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.591
Andre.

44:01.591 --> 44:03.008
I know why you're here.

44:03.008 --> 44:05.092
I'm so...
I'm so sorry about James.

44:08.257 --> 44:09.674
Please, say something.

44:10.841 --> 44:12.050
ANDRE:  Yes.

44:13.549 --> 44:15.591
"Yes"?

44:15.591 --> 44:17.424
Yes what? What does...
What does that mean?

44:18.883 --> 44:19.966
ANDRE:  Yes.

44:20.549 --> 44:21.716
Andre?

44:22.382 --> 44:23.549
Andre!

44:26.008 --> 44:27.424
No, don't go!

44:30.674 --> 44:31.800
(SOBS) Don't go.

44:45.925 --> 44:47.092
(SIGHS)

44:47.092 --> 44:48.674
I'm sorry that I pushed.

44:48.674 --> 44:52.008
I just, um, wanted to say
good night before I left.

44:52.008 --> 44:54.092
I'm sorry I had to
leave like that.

44:55.966 --> 44:57.800
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

44:57.800 --> 44:59.634
Say, um...

44:59.634 --> 45:01.800
Why don't you meet me
at the marina tomorrow?

45:01.800 --> 45:03.133
Slip 44.

45:03.133 --> 45:05.300
-I don't think...
-It is not a date.

45:06.175 --> 45:08.759
Not a date. Just hanging out.

45:08.759 --> 45:10.092
What do you say?

45:10.092 --> 45:12.801
-11:00?
-Uh...

45:12.801 --> 45:14.509
Okay, great. Great!
I know my way out.

45:14.509 --> 45:16.383
So, uh, thank you,
have a good night.

45:16.383 --> 45:19.801
Um, don't forget,
slip 44, okay?

45:19.801 --> 45:21.133
Bye.

45:24.967 --> 45:28.051
Hey. You found it.

45:28.051 --> 45:29.801
I guess I did.

45:29.801 --> 45:31.675
I thought maybe
we'd take her out.

45:33.342 --> 45:35.093
I'm not a big fan of boats.

45:35.093 --> 45:36.884
Oh, okay. Um...

45:36.884 --> 45:38.717
Right. Uh...

45:38.717 --> 45:40.467
-How about a walk then?
-Great.

45:40.467 --> 45:41.801
Okay, let's go.

45:42.550 --> 45:43.884
Come on, after you.

45:44.884 --> 45:46.884
Can I ask you something?

45:46.884 --> 45:49.759
Why did you suddenly
switch off last night?

45:49.759 --> 45:51.467
Are you really
that scared of me?

45:52.592 --> 45:54.884
No, it's not that. I'm just

45:54.884 --> 45:58.134
nowhere near ready
for a relationship

45:58.134 --> 45:59.842
or dating or anything.

45:59.842 --> 46:02.675
Yeah, you've mentioned that,
several times.

46:02.675 --> 46:06.093
So, what, do you just like
the challenge, then?

46:06.093 --> 46:07.510
No.

46:07.510 --> 46:09.634
No, I like you.

46:09.634 --> 46:12.176
I do.
Even if it's just friends.

46:12.176 --> 46:14.676
Why do you want to be
friends with me?
I'm kind of a mess.

46:14.676 --> 46:17.051
-Eh...
-You've got everything
all figured out.

46:17.051 --> 46:18.343
I do?

46:18.343 --> 46:21.718
Yeah, I mean,
you travel the world,

46:21.718 --> 46:23.426
you have the freedom
to see things

46:23.426 --> 46:26.093
and experience things
few people do.

46:26.093 --> 46:27.926
Seems pretty perfect to me.

46:27.926 --> 46:30.468
But they're just things.
They're nothing real.

46:31.009 --> 46:33.176
(SIGHS)

46:33.176 --> 46:34.885
I mean, you've faced
everything the universe
has thrown at you head-on.

46:34.885 --> 46:36.384
-You're like a warrior,
you know.
-(CHUCKLES)

46:36.384 --> 46:38.593
You have a purpose,
you got a life.

46:38.593 --> 46:39.718
So do you.

46:39.718 --> 46:42.301
(SIGHS)
Yeah, but, I don't know.

46:42.301 --> 46:46.259
I'm starting to realize that
it may not be the one I want.

46:46.259 --> 46:48.927
Well, I'm happy to switch
houses with you.

46:48.927 --> 46:50.218
(CHUCKLES)

46:50.218 --> 46:51.885
Well, I do kind of
like my house.

46:51.885 --> 46:54.052
It's not the house. It's...

46:54.052 --> 46:55.718
It's what's inside the house.

46:55.718 --> 46:57.551
And that's something
that I've never had.

46:58.718 --> 47:00.718
Credit card debt, a mortgage,

47:00.718 --> 47:02.968
bills I can't even
begin to pay. Never mind.

47:03.885 --> 47:06.927
Look, can I ask you a favor?

47:06.927 --> 47:09.635
-As an official friend?
-Sure.

47:09.635 --> 47:12.718
Would you please let me
help you open your own bakery?

47:14.010 --> 47:15.760
Oh, James, not this again.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.094
No, no, no, one of
my storefronts on Main Street
just came open.

47:18.094 --> 47:19.843
So it's a great location.

47:19.843 --> 47:22.260
I mean, people would
kill for this location.

47:22.260 --> 47:24.469
-Not me.
-It used to be a cafe,

47:24.469 --> 47:25.843
so it's practically
ready to go.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.344
You could be
up and running in a month.

47:27.344 --> 47:29.635
-Okay, that sounds incredible.
-Okay, don't overthink it.

47:29.635 --> 47:31.427
Just say yes. Say it with me.

47:31.427 --> 47:33.427
Y-E-S spells...

47:33.427 --> 47:34.843
-Yes.
-Yes.

47:34.843 --> 47:37.385
-Did you just say yes?
-How did he know?

47:37.385 --> 47:38.927
-Who?
-What?

47:38.927 --> 47:41.010
(CHUCKLES) What? I'm confused.
Did you say just yes?

47:42.802 --> 47:45.260
-I guess I did.
-Yes!

47:45.260 --> 47:47.968
That's great! Congratulations.

47:47.968 --> 47:49.719
(CHUCKLES)
You're gonna have a bakery.

47:53.302 --> 47:55.302
Well, here we are.

47:55.302 --> 47:58.968
The "Hurry Up and Think
of a Name for the Bake Shop"
Bake Shop.

47:58.968 --> 48:01.636
-I don't think
that's going to work.
-Yeah, probably not.

48:01.636 --> 48:03.302
So, any ideas?

48:03.302 --> 48:04.677
I'll think of something.

48:05.511 --> 48:06.761
Okay.

48:06.761 --> 48:08.260
You ready?

48:08.260 --> 48:09.511
Ready.

48:31.011 --> 48:32.969
It's perfect.

48:32.969 --> 48:35.844
(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

48:37.844 --> 48:39.386
-(LAUGHS)
-Very nice.

48:39.386 --> 48:40.511
Where did you learn French?

48:40.511 --> 48:43.178
Uh... Milo taught me.

48:43.178 --> 48:44.511
(WHISTLING)

48:47.095 --> 48:49.136
Uh, you weren't gonna
do the whole

48:49.136 --> 48:51.261
"Playfully splatter paint
on the other person" bit,
were you?

48:52.886 --> 48:55.637
-You're no fun.
-I'm super fun.

48:55.637 --> 48:57.178
No, you're not.

48:58.220 --> 49:00.678
Yes, I am.

49:00.678 --> 49:02.553
You were gonna splatter me
with paint, weren't you?

49:03.512 --> 49:05.345
-No.
-Yes, you were.

49:05.345 --> 49:06.678
I can tell.

49:07.512 --> 49:09.095
Uh-uh.

49:09.095 --> 49:11.553
I'm telling you right now,
this'll end badly for you.

49:11.553 --> 49:13.762
Oh, you can drip your paint
all you want, sister,

49:13.762 --> 49:15.428
I will paint you up.

49:15.428 --> 49:17.553
-Really?
-I'm very good
with a paintbrush.

49:20.220 --> 49:21.553
(LAUGHING)

49:21.553 --> 49:23.845
Jeez, what did we carry these,
like, a mile?

49:23.845 --> 49:26.470
-It's not a mile.
-Think I'm getting a blister.

49:26.470 --> 49:28.386
-I'm just, kind of like...
-You're not gonna
get a blister.

49:28.386 --> 49:31.428
-I just wanna
stop for a second.
-Hey, what are ya doin'?

49:32.220 --> 49:34.929
We got work to do.

49:34.929 --> 49:36.970
-All right.
-It's so nice out, isn't it?

49:39.553 --> 49:41.220
-See, you wanted a break, too.
-Yes.

49:50.720 --> 49:54.137
-Are you guys hungry?
-Do we have to eat here again?

49:54.137 --> 49:55.762
I feel like we officially
live here now.

49:55.762 --> 49:58.595
Look, I know it's been tough
spending so much time here,

49:58.595 --> 50:00.346
but trust me, once we open,

50:00.346 --> 50:02.262
everything at home
will go back to normal.

50:02.262 --> 50:05.387
-No!
-Milo?

50:05.387 --> 50:07.887
I don't want it
like it was before.

50:07.887 --> 50:09.804
You were sad
and now you're happy.

50:09.804 --> 50:11.262
I like it like this.

50:13.137 --> 50:15.054
I kind of do, too.

50:15.054 --> 50:16.804
So pizza from down the street?

50:17.970 --> 50:19.304
Pizza from down the street.

50:19.304 --> 50:22.137
This bakery is gonna do great.
I know it!

50:22.137 --> 50:25.012
What if no one comes?
What if this is
a huge mistake?

50:25.012 --> 50:28.471
What if I give everyone
food poisoning?

50:28.471 --> 50:32.221
Uh, you took the Arsenic Apple
Fritters off the menu?

50:32.221 --> 50:34.304
-(CHUCKLES)
-Then I think
we're gonna be just fine.

50:36.221 --> 50:39.012
This may be more than
we should have tried at once.

50:39.012 --> 50:40.387
-I think so, too.
-Whoa! Oh.

50:40.387 --> 50:41.805
-Whoa, whoa, wait, no, no, no.
-Whoa, whoa!

50:41.805 --> 50:43.262
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-I got it.

50:43.262 --> 50:45.221
-You got it?
-Yeah. Okay.

50:45.221 --> 50:46.471
-Okay.
-Yeah, okay. I got it.
Okay, yeah.

50:46.471 --> 50:47.679
Okay, here we go.

50:53.346 --> 50:55.137
Just take one bite.

50:55.137 --> 50:56.638
No.

50:56.638 --> 50:59.138
No, look, I understand
that it's trendy,

50:59.138 --> 51:02.721
but I just don't get the whole
"bacon in dessert" thing.

51:02.721 --> 51:05.180
-Don't you trust me?
-(CHUCKLES)

51:05.180 --> 51:06.721
Well, it's not...

51:09.138 --> 51:10.554
(MUFFLED)
Well, now I don't trust you.

51:10.554 --> 51:12.180
Just taste it.

51:17.180 --> 51:18.263
See?

51:21.429 --> 51:23.138
I don't understand.

51:23.138 --> 51:25.388
Sometimes two things
that don't seem to
belong together

51:25.388 --> 51:26.763
make a pretty good pair.

51:28.846 --> 51:30.554
You're absolutely right.

51:35.430 --> 51:38.263
All right. Thank you,
everybody, for coming.

51:38.263 --> 51:40.472
This is a really
special day for us.

51:40.472 --> 51:42.846
So... Ready?

51:42.846 --> 51:44.347
-I'm more than ready.
-Okay.

51:44.347 --> 51:46.305
But, before we do that,
there's one last thing.

51:48.013 --> 51:49.180
(CHUCKLES)

51:49.180 --> 51:50.305
Whoa!

51:51.639 --> 51:53.555
-I'm famous!
-(LAUGHING)

51:54.846 --> 51:57.555
Everybody, please, come in.

51:57.555 --> 52:00.180
-What do you think?
-Kind of cool.

52:00.180 --> 52:01.347
I'll take it.

52:02.222 --> 52:03.597
I wish Dad was here.

52:05.222 --> 52:07.430
He is.

52:07.430 --> 52:10.180
-Can we go in?
-Let's go in! Let's go in.

52:10.180 --> 52:11.555
Mother, you made it.

52:11.555 --> 52:13.889
I was surprised
to hear from you.

52:13.889 --> 52:15.722
I thought you were
in Paris and Hong Kong.

52:15.722 --> 52:18.263
-I decided to stay home.
-Oh!

52:18.263 --> 52:19.931
Shall we go to Silver's
for coffee?

52:19.931 --> 52:22.680
Actually, this place is having
its grand opening today

52:22.680 --> 52:24.305
and I was hoping you might
try it with me.

52:25.472 --> 52:26.722
-Yes?
-Well, all right.

52:26.722 --> 52:28.806
-You look lovely, as usual.
-Thank you.

52:30.056 --> 52:31.223
Ah.

52:31.223 --> 52:32.722
Well...

52:32.722 --> 52:33.972
(CHUCKLES)

52:35.472 --> 52:37.430
This is amazing.

52:37.430 --> 52:39.931
Thank you so much.
I couldn't have done this
without you.

52:39.931 --> 52:42.389
Why is she thanking you?
Why are you thanking him?

52:42.389 --> 52:46.680
Uh, I'm the bakery's
primary investor.

52:46.680 --> 52:49.764
Um, Annie, please meet
my mother, Lillian.

52:49.764 --> 52:51.806
Lillian,
this is Annie Harlowe.

52:51.806 --> 52:53.847
-So nice to meet you!
-(CHUCKLES)

52:53.847 --> 52:55.306
Harlowe.

52:55.306 --> 52:58.348
Our neighbors go by that
same name back in the city.

52:58.348 --> 53:00.223
-Any relation?
-Probably not.

53:00.223 --> 53:02.473
We're Long Island,
born and bred.

53:02.473 --> 53:04.098
In my case, bread.

53:04.931 --> 53:06.264
Bakery, bread.

53:07.556 --> 53:08.931
-I'm sorry. That was terrible.
-(CHUCKLES)

53:08.931 --> 53:11.598
I don't know why I said that.

53:11.598 --> 53:13.431
James, can I steal you
for a minute.

53:13.431 --> 53:15.098
Uh, sure. Consider me stolen.

53:17.306 --> 53:19.931
-Well, congratulations.
-Thank you.

53:19.931 --> 53:22.264
But I've really gotta run.
I'll get my coffee
and scone elsewhere.

53:22.264 --> 53:24.098
Oh, no. Please stay.

53:24.098 --> 53:26.473
My scones are amazing,
and James loves them.

53:26.473 --> 53:31.056
Yes, James is well known for
his occasional sweet tooth.

53:31.056 --> 53:33.431
But after a while,
he always goes back

53:33.431 --> 53:35.306
to the food he knows
is best for him.

53:37.139 --> 53:39.723
I wonder what Susan
thinks of the place?

53:39.723 --> 53:41.640
-Susan?
-James' girlfriend.

53:43.057 --> 53:45.389
I don't know.
I haven't met her.

53:45.389 --> 53:47.473
Oh, well, I'm sure you will,
eventually.

53:48.973 --> 53:51.348
-I look forward to it.
-Mmm.

53:51.348 --> 53:53.807
Just tell James I've gone
to our usual place, hmm?

53:54.973 --> 53:56.182
Congratulations.

53:57.515 --> 53:59.182
Hey, where...
Where's she going?

53:59.182 --> 54:00.723
Listen, I...

54:00.723 --> 54:03.473
I know we're just friends and
this is none of my business,

54:03.473 --> 54:05.598
but you could've told me
about Susan.

54:05.598 --> 54:07.099
(SCOFFS) I'm sorry, what?

54:07.099 --> 54:09.390
Not that it matters to me,
because it doesn't.

54:09.390 --> 54:12.015
But it's just weird
that you never talk about her.
You know?

54:12.015 --> 54:13.307
I mean, we're just friends.
It's fine.

54:13.307 --> 54:15.140
Yeah, you've mentioned that.

54:15.140 --> 54:16.890
Right. So it kind of
makes you a jerk

54:16.890 --> 54:19.099
for hitting on me
in the first place.

54:19.099 --> 54:20.681
Not that I care,
'cause I don't.

54:20.681 --> 54:22.890
Yes, you don't care.
Got it. Registered.

54:22.890 --> 54:26.265
But for the record,
I'm not dating Susan.

54:26.265 --> 54:27.599
I'm not dating anyone.

54:27.599 --> 54:29.432
My mother wants me
to date Susan

54:29.432 --> 54:31.307
because she has
this grand idea

54:31.307 --> 54:32.932
to bring
two great families together.

54:32.932 --> 54:37.182
But anyway, it doesn't matter.
Point is, I'm not with Susan.

54:37.182 --> 54:40.848
I'm not interested in her.

-That's it.

54:49.682 --> 54:52.307

54:52.724 --> 54:53.891
Right.

55:10.100 --> 55:11.390
(CHUCKLES)

55:19.766 --> 55:21.308
Bye, thank you.

55:21.308 --> 55:23.016
-Okay, okay, turn it.
-MILO: Turn it.

55:23.016 --> 55:25.058
-Let's do it... It's official.
-Ready? Ready?

55:25.058 --> 55:27.225
(CHEERING)

55:27.225 --> 55:28.724
We did it!

55:28.724 --> 55:30.724
-Whoo-hoo!
-We did it,
we actually did it.

55:30.724 --> 55:31.849
Whoo-hoo!

55:31.849 --> 55:33.766
Oh, yeah.

55:33.766 --> 55:36.100
Ella, come on!
We're doing the sprinkler.

55:36.933 --> 55:38.557
Can we go, please?

55:38.557 --> 55:40.183
You said we would be home
for dinner this time.

55:40.183 --> 55:41.766
You know what, I got an idea.

55:41.766 --> 55:45.100
How about you guys
let me take you out
for dinner to celebrate?

55:45.100 --> 55:46.849
-Sure.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

55:46.849 --> 55:48.475
-Yeah?
-Yes.

55:48.475 --> 55:50.475
I just want to go home.

55:50.475 --> 55:52.475
We can go anywhere you want.

55:52.475 --> 55:54.016
That would be home.

55:54.016 --> 55:56.225
Ella, I've had enough.

55:56.849 --> 55:58.767
Yeah, me too.

55:58.767 --> 56:00.933
-Ella.
-Hey, it's all right.

56:00.933 --> 56:02.974
It's all right,
maybe just some other day.

56:02.974 --> 56:05.058
No, we're going out.

56:05.058 --> 56:08.974
We've all made sacrifices
to get this place open,
and we're gonna go celebrate.

56:08.974 --> 56:12.141
Okay. So what did you
have in mind?

56:12.141 --> 56:14.642
Someplace I guarantee
you've never been.

56:20.058 --> 56:21.975
-Okay.
-(LAUGHING)

56:21.975 --> 56:24.683
I'm only ever eating here
from now on.

56:24.683 --> 56:26.892
What about the bake shop?

56:26.892 --> 56:28.433
-Okay, two places.
-Okay.

56:28.433 --> 56:29.892
Since my name's on the sign,

56:29.892 --> 56:31.767
can I eat as many cookies
as I want?

56:31.767 --> 56:33.517
Nope, but good try.

56:33.517 --> 56:35.642
-ALL: Cheers.
-(GLASS CLINKING)

the whole bonding thing?

56:42.809 --> 56:45.017
Ella, come talk with me
right now.

56:47.184 --> 56:50.226
-What?
-You will apologize to James
for being rude.

56:50.226 --> 56:53.809
And if I don't,
what are you gonna do,
ground me?

56:53.809 --> 56:55.142
I'm already at home
all the time,

56:55.142 --> 56:56.351
so that would
only make it official.

56:56.351 --> 56:59.101
-Is this about ComicFest?
-No!

56:59.101 --> 57:00.850
(SIGHS) Just forget it.

57:00.850 --> 57:02.518
No, I'm not going
to forget it.

57:02.518 --> 57:04.309
-You need to tell me
why you're so angry.
-Mom, Mom!

57:04.309 --> 57:06.518
-What, sweetie?
-I have to go to the bathroom.

57:06.518 --> 57:07.809
-Okay.
-I'll take him.

57:17.934 --> 57:19.726
I just... I don't know
what to do with her.

57:19.726 --> 57:22.768
Well, it's okay. I get it.

57:23.850 --> 57:25.392
She, uh...

57:25.392 --> 57:29.226
She sees what's happening
between us, I think.

57:29.226 --> 57:31.893
There's nothing
happening between us.
We're just friends.

57:31.893 --> 57:33.267
Come on, Annie.

57:34.392 --> 57:36.226
I don't want to kiss
any of my other friends.

57:38.267 --> 57:40.226
And it's more than that.

57:42.935 --> 57:44.684
I've never met
anyone like you.

57:46.267 --> 57:47.810
And these last few weeks,

57:48.976 --> 57:51.226
they've been life-changing.

57:51.226 --> 57:52.684
They really have.

57:55.102 --> 57:58.976
And you have incredibly
beautiful eyes, you know that?

58:23.435 --> 58:27.310
Hey, so, Maddy just texted me
about the sleepover tonight.

58:27.310 --> 58:30.310
-I thought you
didn't want to go.
-They convinced me.

58:30.310 --> 58:33.435
Besides, I do kind of miss
hanging out with everyone.

58:33.435 --> 58:34.935
So can I go?

58:34.935 --> 58:36.393
I mean, I shouldn't let you

58:36.393 --> 58:38.935
after the way
you've been acting.

58:38.935 --> 58:41.435
But I think it would be
good for you to hang out
with your friends again.

58:41.976 --> 58:43.060
So do I.

58:44.060 --> 58:45.435
Okay.

58:45.435 --> 58:47.519
I'll drop you off
on the way home.

58:47.519 --> 58:48.811
Awesome. Thanks.

58:51.018 --> 58:52.435
Goodnight, Milo.

58:54.102 --> 58:56.644
Sorry, long bedtime story.

58:56.644 --> 58:58.852
I couldn't just leave after
what happened at dinner.

59:02.060 --> 59:03.185
No, please.

59:03.185 --> 59:04.811
You got to stop doing that.

59:05.977 --> 59:07.811
-I'm sorry, I'm just...
-Look.

59:10.477 --> 59:13.936
What happened to Andre
is a tragedy.

59:14.936 --> 59:16.352
It's terrible.

59:16.352 --> 59:19.519
I can't imagine anything
more painful.

59:19.519 --> 59:22.269
But it doesn't mean that you
don't ever get to love again.

59:23.977 --> 59:26.769
-You don't understand.
-Well, then help me, Annie.

59:26.769 --> 59:28.727
Help me understand.

59:28.727 --> 59:31.061
I promised to love
Andre forever.

59:33.519 --> 59:35.353
I can't fall for someone else.

59:39.269 --> 59:40.353
But you did.

Yes.

I did... Did I?

01:00:02.603 --> 01:00:04.603
-You did.
-I'm sorry, James.

01:00:04.603 --> 01:00:06.103
Listen, a lot of things
have happened.

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.936
I wish I could explain them,
but I can't and...

01:00:07.936 --> 01:00:10.311
And now it's happening again.
And I just... I can't...

01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:12.353
-I should not have done this.
-Okay, you're
pulling away again.

01:00:12.353 --> 01:00:14.061
-Please, Annie. Don't...
-No, I'm sorry.

01:00:15.019 --> 01:00:16.311
It's Maddy's mom.

Hi, Kim.

01:00:21.895 --> 01:00:23.937
Of course
she's at the sleepover.

01:00:23.937 --> 01:00:26.520
No, she has to be there.
I dropped her off.

01:00:30.311 --> 01:00:32.062
Okay, um, I have to go.

01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:35.394
Ella left the sleepover.

01:00:35.394 --> 01:00:37.853
And Kim, the other girls,
nobody's seen her.

01:00:37.853 --> 01:00:39.311
They don't know
where she went.

01:00:42.353 --> 01:00:44.269
Okay, it just went
to voice mail.

01:00:45.394 --> 01:00:46.770
She turned her phone off?

01:00:48.394 --> 01:00:51.561
Why would she do that?
Where is she?

01:00:51.561 --> 01:00:53.354
Okay, okay.

01:00:53.354 --> 01:00:54.645
Let's go find her, okay?

01:00:55.561 --> 01:00:56.853
I'm gonna call the police.

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:08.895
So you don't have
a GPS tracker on her phone?

01:01:08.895 --> 01:01:10.895
I didn't think I'd need one
with her.

01:01:13.312 --> 01:01:14.978
You have to find her.

01:01:14.978 --> 01:01:17.853
Annie, we'll find her.
We'll find her.

01:01:17.853 --> 01:01:20.229
Okay, I think I have
everything I need.

Try not to worry, ma'am.

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:26.479
We've got patrols out,
and her name's in the system.

01:01:26.479 --> 01:01:28.937
So unless she has money
to travel, she can't be far.

01:01:37.896 --> 01:01:39.437
What?

01:01:39.437 --> 01:01:41.437
She has the money saved from
helping me with catering jobs.

01:01:41.437 --> 01:01:42.562

I want to go find her.

Just let me make a few calls,
all right?

a terrible mistake
having you around.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:44.981
Oh, perfect. Go away.

01:05:44.981 --> 01:05:46.941
I am taking you home
to Montauk. Come on.

01:05:46.941 --> 01:05:48.315
No.

01:05:48.315 --> 01:05:50.774
Hey, Ella, listen. Listen!

01:05:50.774 --> 01:05:53.398
Your mother is out of her mind
with worry.

01:05:53.398 --> 01:05:54.857
You know what she went through
two years ago.

01:05:54.857 --> 01:05:56.524
How could you possibly
put her through that again?

01:05:56.524 --> 01:05:59.357
-That's not what I'm doing.
-Think about it for a minute.

01:05:59.357 --> 01:06:01.941
Except I'm not dead.
So it's not the same.

01:06:01.941 --> 01:06:04.024
If anything were to
happen to you,

01:06:04.024 --> 01:06:06.857
it would be her
worst fear realized.

01:06:06.857 --> 01:06:08.565
And if you'd seen her tonight,
you would know.

01:06:08.565 --> 01:06:10.357
She is inconsolable.

01:06:10.357 --> 01:06:11.941
And I hate seeing her
like that.

01:06:13.524 --> 01:06:16.233
Do you really care about her
that much?

01:06:16.233 --> 01:06:18.732
Of course I do.
I care about all of you guys.

01:06:18.732 --> 01:06:20.191
Why? I've been such a brat.

01:06:20.982 --> 01:06:22.358
(CHUCKLES)

01:06:22.358 --> 01:06:24.899
Yes, you've been a challenge,

01:06:24.899 --> 01:06:26.857
but you know what,
you're just protecting
your mom.

01:06:26.857 --> 01:06:29.982
So really,
you're being a great daughter.

01:06:29.982 --> 01:06:32.024
But what if you just want to
look like the big hero

01:06:32.024 --> 01:06:36.066
who swoops in and saves
the poor widow and her kids?

01:06:36.066 --> 01:06:38.816
And then what if
you get bored?
You just gonna move on?

01:06:39.441 --> 01:06:40.982
Then what?

01:06:40.982 --> 01:06:43.566
Then I have to watch my mom...

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:45.233
-Oh, forget it.
-Ella, look at me.

01:06:47.233 --> 01:06:49.732
-I'm not going anywhere.
-Come on.

01:06:49.732 --> 01:06:52.066
Like you want a teenage
step-daughter who runs away
from home?

01:06:52.066 --> 01:06:54.399
To a comic book convention?
Come on. (CHUCKLES)

01:06:54.399 --> 01:06:56.899
I can think of a million worse
places you could've gone.

01:06:57.608 --> 01:06:58.982
So, please.

01:07:00.108 --> 01:07:02.066
Let me take you home, okay?

01:07:02.066 --> 01:07:04.982
I can't leave. I didn't even
get to meet Tim O'Connor.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:08.650
-Sorry, who?
-Tim O'Connor?

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:11.316
-(CHUCKLES)
-Why is that funny?

01:07:11.316 --> 01:07:12.983
He's a genius.

01:07:12.983 --> 01:07:16.441
-I want to be him one day.
-Come with me.

01:07:16.441 --> 01:07:18.025
-The exit's that way.
-I know.

01:07:21.441 --> 01:07:23.525
I can't believe
you're letting me do this.

01:07:23.525 --> 01:07:25.691
You're about to be grounded
for eternity,

01:07:25.691 --> 01:07:27.733
so you may as well finish
what you started. Thank you.

01:07:38.525 --> 01:07:39.775
Jimmy B.!

01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:43.650
I can't believe it!
What are you doing here?

01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:46.691
Hey, buddy,
good to see you, man.
How are you doing?

01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:49.608
This is Ella.

01:07:49.608 --> 01:07:54.109
She's a huge fan and
I'm friends with her mother.

01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:56.317
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Ella.

01:07:56.317 --> 01:07:58.317
Any friend of James
is a friend of mine.

01:07:59.109 --> 01:08:00.775
Thanks.

01:08:00.775 --> 01:08:03.942
Um, can you sign my book?
I'm your biggest fan.

01:08:03.942 --> 01:08:05.567
You got it.

01:08:05.567 --> 01:08:07.400
Well, she might be
your biggest fan,

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.150
but seeing as how
I was in the room

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:10.983
the first time you drew
Jimmy Freedom,

01:08:10.983 --> 01:08:13.317
I think that makes me
the original fan.

01:08:14.651 --> 01:08:16.526
Wait, what?

01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:19.858
Yeah. Jimmy B.
was my roommate in college.

01:08:19.858 --> 01:08:22.651
Of course, back then,
he was a huge nerd.

01:08:22.651 --> 01:08:25.692
Well, I still am a huge nerd,
but now I work out. So...

01:08:26.526 --> 01:08:27.526
See?

01:08:29.317 --> 01:08:32.317
I based the character's look
on James here.

01:08:32.317 --> 01:08:33.692
-Really?
-TIM: Mmm-hmm.

01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:35.859
Why didn't you tell me
all this before?

01:08:35.859 --> 01:08:39.943
Well, seeing as how
this is the most
you've ever talked to me,

01:08:39.943 --> 01:08:41.859
I didn't have a chance.

01:08:41.859 --> 01:08:43.734
-(CHUCKLES)
-Did you?

01:08:47.776 --> 01:08:49.943
Thanks for doing that. Really.

01:08:50.734 --> 01:08:51.943
It was...

01:08:51.943 --> 01:08:55.442
-It was cool of you.
-You're very welcome.

01:08:55.442 --> 01:08:58.026
But if you ever pull something
like that again,

01:08:58.026 --> 01:09:01.193
you can kiss your Tim O'Connor
connection goodbye, all right?

01:09:01.193 --> 01:09:02.399
(LAUGHS)

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:04.401
What? What's so funny?

01:09:05.234 --> 01:09:06.567
You sound like a dad.

01:09:08.859 --> 01:09:10.818
Really? I do?

01:09:12.526 --> 01:09:13.526
Hmm.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:17.943
Look, Ella, you know that

01:09:17.943 --> 01:09:20.734
I would never try to replace
your dad, right?

01:09:20.734 --> 01:09:23.568
Actually, that's like,
literally what you'd be doing.

01:09:23.568 --> 01:09:25.401
No. No, that's not it. I...

01:09:27.734 --> 01:09:30.984
I'm just trying to find
my place in all this.

01:09:32.151 --> 01:09:33.984
I want to make your mom happy.

01:09:33.984 --> 01:09:37.568
And you and Milo,
if you'll let me.

01:09:38.734 --> 01:09:39.859
We'll see.

01:09:41.901 --> 01:09:44.068
-I can live with that.
-(CHUCKLES)

01:09:44.068 --> 01:09:45.318
I can live with that.

01:09:49.568 --> 01:09:50.819
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

01:09:52.693 --> 01:09:55.527
-Hey, I'm so sorry, Mom.
-Oh, sweetie.

01:09:55.527 --> 01:09:58.235
Oh, gosh.
What were you thinking?

01:09:58.235 --> 01:09:59.735
I was worried sick!

01:09:59.735 --> 01:10:01.777
You are grounded
until you're 30.

01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:04.652
Wow, she let you off easy.

01:10:06.693 --> 01:10:08.443
Thank you
for bringing her home.

01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:10.944
I promised you I would.

01:10:12.318 --> 01:10:14.069
I'm starving.
I'm gonna go make a sandwich.

01:10:14.069 --> 01:10:16.610
-I'll make you a sandwich.
-It's all right.

01:10:20.693 --> 01:10:21.902
James, no.

01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:23.860
It's okay, Mom.

01:10:25.194 --> 01:10:27.443
James and I, we're cool now.

01:10:28.819 --> 01:10:31.111
-Thanks again, James.
-You're welcome, kiddo.

01:10:45.111 --> 01:10:46.610
I thought we were okay?

01:10:47.319 --> 01:10:48.486
We're not.

01:10:50.902 --> 01:10:52.486
After what happened tonight,

01:10:52.486 --> 01:10:54.985
I know that I just can't love
anyone else.

01:10:56.902 --> 01:10:58.819
Because I can't lose
anyone else.

01:10:58.819 --> 01:11:00.319
I don't ever want to
feel like this.

01:11:03.152 --> 01:11:04.194
Really?

01:11:05.152 --> 01:11:06.486
I'm sorry.

01:11:10.111 --> 01:11:11.319
(SIGHS)

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:14.611
Okay.

01:11:15.361 --> 01:11:16.486
Okay.

01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:29.861
(DOOR SHUTS)

01:11:33.112 --> 01:11:35.112
Why did you let him go?

01:11:35.112 --> 01:11:36.945
It's hard to explain,
but it's for the best.

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:39.070
This is all my fault.

01:11:39.861 --> 01:11:41.486
If I hadn't left,

01:11:41.486 --> 01:11:45.028
you wouldn't have freaked out
and James would still be here.

01:11:45.028 --> 01:11:47.112
Sweetie,
this is not your fault.

01:11:47.112 --> 01:11:48.195
Okay?

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.611
It's my fault
for letting him in
in the first place.

01:12:00.736 --> 01:12:01.903
(SNIFFLES)

01:12:27.861 --> 01:12:29.612
Oh, Matt, tell your mom
I'm gonna call.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.821
There you are.

01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:35.945
Why haven't you
called me back?

01:12:35.945 --> 01:12:38.779
Are you still mad at me
for telling Amy about Susan?

01:12:38.779 --> 01:12:40.529
There is no Susan.

01:12:40.529 --> 01:12:42.070
And it's Annie. Was.

01:12:43.362 --> 01:12:45.237
-Was Annie.
-I knew it!

01:12:45.237 --> 01:12:48.445
I knew you were dating
the cookie lady.

01:12:48.445 --> 01:12:50.237
Please don't call her that.

01:12:50.237 --> 01:12:52.445
She's a world-class
pastry chef.

01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:55.320
And it's over.

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:58.029
Well, that's a relief.

01:12:58.029 --> 01:13:00.196
I don't have to tell you
how difficult it would be

01:13:00.196 --> 01:13:03.695
to bring somebody else's
children into the picture.
You don't want that.

01:13:03.695 --> 01:13:05.987
You know what, Mother,
you have absolutely no idea

01:13:05.987 --> 01:13:07.529
what I want!

01:13:10.279 --> 01:13:13.154
Fine. Just sit down
and tell me.

01:13:22.987 --> 01:13:24.154
I want...

01:13:27.488 --> 01:13:30.238
I want what Annie has.

01:13:31.612 --> 01:13:32.821
A life.

01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:39.446
A real, a wonderfully messy,
normal life.

01:13:40.737 --> 01:13:43.404
When I was with Annie,
I was happy.

01:13:43.404 --> 01:13:46.279
For the first time in my life,
I didn't have to play the role

01:13:46.279 --> 01:13:48.780
of James Braddock III,
and that felt really good.

01:13:51.696 --> 01:13:55.363
I'm tired, I'm so tired

01:13:55.363 --> 01:13:58.530
of going everywhere
and feeling like I'm nowhere.

01:14:01.655 --> 01:14:03.446
I'm tired
of not having a home.

01:14:04.738 --> 01:14:07.905
And when I was with Annie,

01:14:07.905 --> 01:14:10.863
I was happy,
and I felt like I was home.

01:14:14.114 --> 01:14:15.446
And now...

01:14:16.613 --> 01:14:17.696
(SIGHS)

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.488
I just feel lost.

01:14:24.488 --> 01:14:26.571
I'm so lost right now.

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:30.072
I had no idea
she meant that much to you.

01:14:30.072 --> 01:14:33.072
Yeah, well, doesn't matter
much now, does it?

01:14:35.988 --> 01:14:39.488
I know I can be
hard on you sometimes,

01:14:39.488 --> 01:14:41.988
but it's because
I want the very best for you.

01:14:44.239 --> 01:14:46.197
You're a good man.

01:14:46.197 --> 01:14:48.489
Your father would've been
so proud of you.

01:14:50.447 --> 01:14:51.738
He's not dead, Mother.

01:14:51.738 --> 01:14:53.947
He's just in Florida
with wife number three.

01:14:53.947 --> 01:14:55.655
Same thing.

01:14:55.655 --> 01:14:57.114
-There you go, ma'am.
-Thank you.

01:15:04.364 --> 01:15:07.280
You know,
your father and I were brought
together by our families.

01:15:09.364 --> 01:15:11.447
And yet I'm not sure
we were ever happy.

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:15.988
Not even at the beginning.

01:15:15.988 --> 01:15:17.739
I don't know why I thought
I could do any better.

01:15:18.656 --> 01:15:21.072
It's okay. You meant well.

01:15:21.072 --> 01:15:24.656
No, I should just mind
my own business.
And from now on, I will.

01:15:24.656 --> 01:15:27.614
-I would appreciate that.
-(LAUGHS)

01:15:27.614 --> 01:15:30.322
I can always talk to her
and apologize.

01:15:30.322 --> 01:15:33.197
No. Please.

01:15:33.197 --> 01:15:35.239
It has nothing to do with
what you did anyway.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.031
Just wasn't meant to be,
I guess.

01:15:48.656 --> 01:15:50.031
(LAUGHING)

01:15:50.031 --> 01:15:52.031
Because that would be bad.

01:16:05.697 --> 01:16:06.739
Hi.

01:16:08.448 --> 01:16:09.948
Oh.

01:16:09.948 --> 01:16:12.989
Just, uh, doing
my afternoon check-in,

01:16:12.989 --> 01:16:14.573
which is what investors do.

01:16:15.948 --> 01:16:19.823
Well, it's, uh...
It's going well.

01:16:19.823 --> 01:16:21.948
Getting busier by the day.
So, it's great.

01:16:21.948 --> 01:16:25.031
It's great. That is great.
That's great.

01:16:25.031 --> 01:16:26.740
Is that a new lemon cake
in the window?

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.073
-Yep.
-Yeah.

01:16:28.073 --> 01:16:30.031
Yeah, that's great.
Love lemon cake.

01:16:30.031 --> 01:16:31.365
(CHUCKLES) Me, too.

01:16:33.281 --> 01:16:34.657
Look, um...

01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:37.031
I was thinking maybe
tomorrow afternoon

01:16:37.031 --> 01:16:38.948
you could have
Ella and Milo come by?

01:16:39.698 --> 01:16:40.948
I miss 'em.

01:16:41.948 --> 01:16:43.156
They miss you too.

01:16:45.156 --> 01:16:47.073
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)

01:16:48.115 --> 01:16:50.115
So, have you heard from
Andre at all?

01:16:50.865 --> 01:16:52.907
James.

01:16:52.907 --> 01:16:55.365
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

01:16:55.365 --> 01:16:56.907
Um... (CHUCKLES)

01:16:57.907 --> 01:16:59.323
Um...

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:02.240
Back to the lemon cake.
(CHUCKLES)

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.281
I need to go do something
in the back.

01:17:04.281 --> 01:17:06.240
Of course, I understand.

01:17:28.241 --> 01:17:30.532
(SIGHS) This is stupid.

01:17:30.532 --> 01:17:33.116
-What?
-This is stupid.

01:17:33.116 --> 01:17:35.865
Ella, please don't talk to me
that way.

01:17:35.865 --> 01:17:37.491
Or what?

01:17:37.491 --> 01:17:40.074
-I'm not gonna do this again.
-Do what?

01:17:40.907 --> 01:17:43.491
Watch you disappear.

01:17:43.491 --> 01:17:46.282
You were finally
becoming yourself again
when James was around.

01:17:46.282 --> 01:17:50.616
Sweetie,
when James was around,
you were miserable.

01:17:50.616 --> 01:17:54.116
That's because I knew that
if he broke up with you,

01:17:54.116 --> 01:17:56.074
you'd be even worse
than you were before.

01:17:58.491 --> 01:18:01.616
And that maybe I'd
never get you back.

01:18:02.908 --> 01:18:05.116
I'm just so tired

01:18:05.116 --> 01:18:07.116
of having to worry about you
all the time, Mom.

01:18:08.116 --> 01:18:09.282
It's too hard.

01:18:09.908 --> 01:18:10.950
Sweetie.

01:18:12.241 --> 01:18:14.407
Is that what
you've been doing?

01:18:14.407 --> 01:18:15.616
Protecting me?

01:18:19.157 --> 01:18:20.658
Oh, my little girl.

01:18:22.991 --> 01:18:26.282
You should never have had
to carry that burden.

01:18:26.282 --> 01:18:30.158
I'm the one who's supposed
to protect you.

01:18:30.158 --> 01:18:33.366
All this time, I thought
that you were just angry
about your father's death.

01:18:34.366 --> 01:18:35.533
I was.

01:18:36.991 --> 01:18:39.117
But also that you just
gave up!

01:18:40.825 --> 01:18:43.950
Ella, I am so sorry.

01:18:44.783 --> 01:18:46.449
Okay? You just...

01:18:46.449 --> 01:18:49.242
You should not have
any of these worries
at your age.

01:18:49.242 --> 01:18:50.658
You should be free
to live your life

01:18:50.658 --> 01:18:52.825
and not worry about mine.

01:18:52.825 --> 01:18:54.574
And you deserve to be happy.

01:18:54.574 --> 01:18:56.991
That's what your dad
would want.

01:18:56.991 --> 01:18:59.075
Do you even hear yourself
right now?

01:18:59.950 --> 01:19:02.617
Don't you deserve to be happy?

01:19:02.617 --> 01:19:04.534
Isn't that what Dad would have
wanted for you?

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:08.158
I just, I don't...

01:19:09.908 --> 01:19:11.492
I don't know what to think.

01:19:13.534 --> 01:19:15.325
Well, I'm sure
what Daddy wanted

01:19:16.033 --> 01:19:17.283
wasn't this.

01:19:21.367 --> 01:19:22.367
(SIGHS)

01:19:35.659 --> 01:19:38.325
(VOICE MESSAGE)
Hi, this is Andre.
Leave a message after the...

01:19:38.325 --> 01:19:40.992
-You know what to do.
-(BEEPS)

01:19:40.992 --> 01:19:42.158
Andre.

01:19:44.408 --> 01:19:46.492
It's me. Just, I want to...

01:19:46.492 --> 01:19:48.034
I just wish
I could talk to you.

01:19:57.118 --> 01:19:58.784
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:20:08.909 --> 01:20:12.076
Ella, sweetie,
could you watch Milo?
I'll be back in a few minutes.

01:20:12.076 --> 01:20:13.243
ELLA: Sure.

01:20:51.868 --> 01:20:52.868
(PHONE BEEPS)

01:20:55.827 --> 01:20:59.576
Hi, it's me.

01:21:02.952 --> 01:21:04.576
You're here, aren't you?

01:21:09.785 --> 01:21:12.660
I'm so confused, I thought
I knew what you wanted,
but now...

01:21:19.493 --> 01:21:21.285
Just, just tell me what to do.

01:21:23.701 --> 01:21:24.827
ANDRE:  Love.

01:21:26.493 --> 01:21:27.827
Yes, I love you.

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:30.827
I'll always love you.

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.827
ANDRE:  James.

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:41.452
But how can I love
someone else
when you're still with me?

01:21:41.452 --> 01:21:42.910
(STATIC)

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:44.910
James.

01:21:52.785 --> 01:21:54.035
(SNIFFLES)

01:21:56.785 --> 01:21:58.035
Are you sure?

01:21:59.827 --> 01:22:00.993
It's okay.

01:22:05.244 --> 01:22:06.536
Bye, Annie.

01:22:09.202 --> 01:22:10.494
(SOBBING)

01:22:23.369 --> 01:22:24.619
Goodbye.

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.328
What are you doing here?

01:22:49.245 --> 01:22:50.619
I got a message.

01:22:52.702 --> 01:22:54.036
"Try Copper Beach."

01:22:56.744 --> 01:22:59.161
-Who sent that?
-Ella.

01:23:01.286 --> 01:23:03.911
I thought for a minute
maybe... You know.

01:23:03.911 --> 01:23:05.953
Imagine the roaming charges
if it was?

01:23:05.953 --> 01:23:09.578
-(CHUCKLES)
-I mean, I don't mean
to make light of it.

01:23:09.578 --> 01:23:12.453
Especially since I kind of...

01:23:12.453 --> 01:23:14.953
I might have heard something
the night Ella went missing,

01:23:14.953 --> 01:23:17.036
but probably not.

01:23:17.036 --> 01:23:18.786
Probably just
your imagination.

01:23:18.786 --> 01:23:20.203
Probably, yeah. Yes.

01:23:23.994 --> 01:23:26.911
It's strange to be here
where we started.

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:29.953
And where...

01:23:31.203 --> 01:23:32.745
Something else ended.

01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:38.328
And where maybe
something's starting again.

01:23:56.162 --> 01:23:57.370
(SIGHS)

01:23:59.162 --> 01:24:02.495
Hmm. So, um, any messages?

01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:04.954
No. I think he's moved on.

01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:08.162
How about you?

01:24:09.829 --> 01:24:11.287
It's time for me
to do the same.

01:24:12.204 --> 01:24:13.329
Really?

01:24:14.162 --> 01:24:15.246
Hmm, okay.

01:24:17.121 --> 01:24:18.912
I'm so sorry
for pushing you away.

01:24:18.912 --> 01:24:21.745
Oh, I'm sorry
that I pushed so hard.

01:24:21.745 --> 01:24:23.954
I couldn't help it though.

01:24:23.954 --> 01:24:26.662
I fell for you
the moment I saw you.

01:24:26.662 --> 01:24:28.703
You mean, when you almost
hit me with your car?

01:24:28.703 --> 01:24:30.329
(CHUCKLES)

01:24:30.329 --> 01:24:33.829
Okay, well,
I think that was an accident.

01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:36.870
Yes, it was.

01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:40.204
Actually, I don't think
it was an accident.

01:24:40.204 --> 01:24:42.870
-Hmm?
-I think it was all
meant to be.

01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:44.329
From the very beginning.

01:24:45.121 --> 01:24:46.371
I think you're right.

01:24:47.704 --> 01:24:50.496
-I love you, Annie.
-I love you, too.

01:25:06.038 --> 01:25:07.746
-ANNIE: Uh-oh, here he comes.
-JAMES: Hey, buddy.

01:25:07.746 --> 01:25:08.996
(JAMES LAUGHS)

01:25:08.996 --> 01:25:11.704
JAMES: You were right.
That's where she was.

01:25:11.704 --> 01:25:13.579
-Let's get inside.
-ALL: Yeah.
