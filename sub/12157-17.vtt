WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:06.240
MIKE... SO I'M LOOKING
AT MANDY'S PROGRESS REPORT.

00:06.274 --> 00:09.009
IF SHE DOESN'T GET AT LEAST
A "B" ON HER TERM PAPER,

00:09.043 --> 00:11.145
SHE'S GONNA FAIL HISTORY.

00:11.179 --> 00:12.580
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.716
THOSE WHO CAN'T PASS HISTORY
ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT.

00:15.749 --> 00:16.717
HMM.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.252
THERE'S NO REPEATING IT.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.321
IF SHE DOESN'T PASS,
SHE WON'T GRADUATE.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.689
OH, BOY.
YEP.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.691
THEN WE'D MISS
THE VALEDICTORIAN'S SPEECH.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.094
HOW WILL WE EVER FIND OUT HOW
WEBSTER'S DEFINES SUCCESS?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.928
(chuckles)

00:27.961 --> 00:31.399
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE GUESS AS
TO WHY MANDY IS SO DISTRACTED.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.567
GIRL,
DID YOU SEE CHLOE'S TWEET?

00:33.601 --> 00:34.868
HILARIOUS!

00:34.902 --> 00:36.270
MANDY, HONEY,
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.839
I KNOW. I'M GONNA RETWEET IT
AND THEN POST IT TO FACEBOOK,

00:38.872 --> 00:40.007
SO BE SURE TO "LIKE" IT
AND THEN "L.O.L." IT THERE.
MANDY.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.041
MANDY.
YEAH.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.210
(laughs) OH, MY GOD.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.911
GO OVER THERE.
TELL HER TO HANG UP.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.113
I'LL VIDEOTAPE IT,
POST IT ON YouTube.

00:45.146 --> 00:48.382
ONE OF HER FRIENDS IS BOUND
TO SEE IT AND TWEET HER.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.517
(speaks indistinctly)

00:49.550 --> 00:51.185
WHOA! OH, MY--AAH!

00:51.219 --> 00:54.722
WHERE DID YOU GUYS COME FROM?
THAT WAS LIKE A MAGIC TRICK.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.924
YOU ARE SPENDING WAY
TOO MUCH TIME ON THE COMPUTER.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.727
OH, MOM. YOU CAN'T SPEND
TOO MUCH TIME ON A COMPUTER.
YEAH. MM.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.096
YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT A TANNING BED.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.132
WE'RE TAKING AWAY
ALL YOUR DEVICES

01:04.165 --> 01:05.733
UNTIL YOU GET
YOUR HISTORY GRADE UP

01:05.766 --> 01:08.068
PAST A "B" SO YOU'LL
PASS THE DAMN CLASS.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.271
YOU--YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY
MY DEVICES!
(Mike) RIGHT HERE.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.973
IT'S HOW PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION
COMMUNICATE AND EXCHANGE IDEAS,

01:13.006 --> 01:16.076
AND TOTES ADORBS CAT PICS.
(imitates cat meowing)

01:16.110 --> 01:17.411
THE SOONER YOU FINISH
YOUR PAPER,

01:17.445 --> 01:19.046
THE SOONER YOU'LL GET THEM BACK.

01:19.079 --> 01:22.716
UGH! I'M HAVING
SO MANY FEELINGS RIGHT NOW.

01:22.750 --> 01:26.787
BUT IF I CAN'T TWEET ABOUT THEM,
AM I EVEN REALLY HAVING THEM?

01:26.820 --> 01:28.256
THINK ABOUT THAT.

01:28.289 --> 01:31.159
(door opens and closes)

01:31.192 --> 01:32.993
HEY, MANDY,
HOW'S IT GOING?

01:33.026 --> 01:36.063
I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.498
MOMMY!

01:37.531 --> 01:39.066
HEY, SWEETIE.
OH, I MISSED YOU.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.668
DID YOU HAVE FUN
STAYING YOUR DADDY'S?

01:40.701 --> 01:43.070
YEAH, WE WATCHED CARTOONS
UNTIL MIDNIGHT!

01:43.103 --> 01:45.439
OH.
YEAH.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.507
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE GIVEN HIM

01:46.540 --> 01:48.776
ALL THAT COFFEE ICE CREAM
LAST NIGHT.

01:48.809 --> 01:49.777
ALTHOUGH A BIG CUP OF IT
THIS MORNING

01:49.810 --> 01:51.612
SURE GOT HIM OUT OF BED.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.014
DID HE AT LEAST
GET HIS HOMEWORK DONE?

01:54.047 --> 01:56.850
HE'S IN KINDERGARTEN, KRIS.
AND WHAT IS THE BIG RUSH

01:56.884 --> 01:59.153
TO TURN HIM INTO SOME SORT
OF CORPORATE WORKER DRONE?

01:59.187 --> 02:00.288
I'M ACTUALLY MORALLY OPPOSED

02:00.321 --> 02:02.590
TO MAKING A 5-YEAR-OLD
DO HOMEWORK.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.124
HE DIDN'T WANNA DO IT,
HUH?

02:04.158 --> 02:05.259
NO.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.127
AND YOU DIDN'T WANNA DEAL
WITH THE TANTRUM,

02:07.161 --> 02:09.096
SO LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE,
I GET STUCK CRACKING THE WHIP,

02:09.129 --> 02:11.499
AND YOU GET
TO BE "FUN DAD."

02:11.532 --> 02:13.767
WELL, LOOKS LIKE I'M GETTING
THE TANTRUM AFTER ALL, SO...

02:13.801 --> 02:17.171
HEY. YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE
TO BE FUN ONCE IN A WHILE.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.806
YEAH. IT'S GREAT.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

02:18.839 --> 02:22.042
I GOTTA GET TO WORK. MWAH.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.211
WHY DO I HAVE THE FEELING
THAT WHEN I LEAVE,

02:23.244 --> 02:24.512
YOU'RE GONNA SAY,
"SHE'S GONE,"

02:24.545 --> 02:26.947
AND A BIG PARTY'S
GONNA BREAK OUT?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.516
NO MORE "FUN DAD."
I GOT IT.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.218
(TV playing indistinctly)

02:30.251 --> 02:31.352
OKAY, GOOD. SHE'S GONE.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.687
SO, BUDDY, YOU REMEMBER
HOW I TOLD YOU

02:33.721 --> 02:34.788
I'M GONNA PULL YOU OUT
OF SCHOOL TOMORROW

02:34.822 --> 02:35.956
FOR THE BASEBALL GAME?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.725
OPENING DAY!

02:37.758 --> 02:38.959
YEAH. OKAY. SHH.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.861
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE THAT A "D.T.M."--

02:40.894 --> 02:43.130
"DON'T TELL MOMMY."

02:43.163 --> 02:47.901
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BLABBED
ABOUT ICE CREAM FOR BREAKFAST.

02:47.935 --> 02:51.905
-- Captions by VITA --

02:51.939 --> 02:54.942
(cheering)

02:59.112 --> 03:01.982
NOTHING LIKE PLAYING HOOKY
ON OPENING DAY WITH YOUR SONS.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.584
SONS?

03:03.617 --> 03:05.085
YOU'RE SKIPPING SCHOOL
TO GO TO A BASEBALL GAME.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.254
TODAY YOU'RE A BOY.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.589
HEY, BOYD,

03:08.622 --> 03:10.724
AFTER THE INNING,
WAVE TO CARLOS HERNANDEZ,

03:10.758 --> 03:12.092
AND HE'LL TOSS YOU
A BALL.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.561
AND RIGHT BEFORE,
YANK OUT A NOSE HAIR.

03:13.594 --> 03:16.196
IT'LL HELP TO HAVE
A TEAR IN YOUR EYE.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.232
HEY, DOES LOOKING PATHETIC
REALLY GET YOU A BALL?

03:18.266 --> 03:19.600
YOU KIDDING? DAD USED TO
BRING ME TO GAMES

03:19.633 --> 03:20.834
WEARING AN EYE PATCH.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.202
TILL WE FIGURED OUT
A NECK BRACE

03:22.236 --> 03:25.673
WILL GET YOU A FREE BALL
AND A TOUR OF THE DUGOUT.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.608
OH, HERE, SON.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.443
YOU CAN PUT YOUR PEANUT SHELLS
IN THIS BOX.
(shells rattle)

03:29.477 --> 03:31.078
NEVER MIND. B-BOYD,
PUT 'EM WHEREVER YOU WANT.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.179
30 BUCKS FOR PARKING--

03:32.212 --> 03:34.515
I MIGHT NOT EVEN GET UP
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.017
(laughs)

03:37.050 --> 03:40.220
WELL, WELL, IF IT ISN'T
MIKE BAXTER.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.025
MR. OUTDOOR MAN.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.194
HEY, BILL, I THOUGHT
YOU GAVE UP YOUR SEASON TICKETS.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.963
OH, NO, THAT'S THE ONLY THING
I KEPT IN THE DIVORCE.

03:49.997 --> 03:55.469
NO WIFE, NO HOUSE. I'M KINDA
AN OUTDOOR MAN MYSELF NOW.

03:55.503 --> 03:56.870
(slaps back)

03:56.904 --> 03:59.039
EASY. THAT'S TRADEMARKED.

03:59.072 --> 04:03.076
YOU KNOW, I TOOK A HIT WHEN YOU
PULLED THAT MALL JOB FROM ME.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.979
AT LEAST NOW I FOUND OUT
MY WIFE ONLY MARRIED ME

04:06.013 --> 04:07.047
FOR MY MONEY!

04:07.080 --> 04:10.984
SO... THANKS FOR THAT, BUDDY.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.553
HEY, BILL, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE TAKE IT EASY

04:12.586 --> 04:14.054
AND JUST ENJOY THE GAME,
HUH?

04:14.087 --> 04:16.890
HEY, LITTLE GUY.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.427
DO YOU KNOW WHY THE MASCOT
IS A T. rex?

04:19.460 --> 04:23.297
'CAUSE YOUR GRANDPA
STABBED HIM IN THE BACK!

04:23.331 --> 04:26.567
THAT MAKES SENSE,
DOESN'T IT?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.336
BILL, YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY,
SAY IT TO MY FACE.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.771
WELL, THEN TURN AROUND
AND BEND OVER.

04:30.804 --> 04:31.972
(laughs)

04:32.005 --> 04:36.143
I'M SAYING THAT YOUR
GRANDFATHER'S FACE IS HIS BUTT.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.411
HE'S 5 YEARS OLD,

04:37.445 --> 04:40.080
BUTT JOKES ARE
HIS BREAD AND BUTTER.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.515
MIKE, DON'T LET HIM RILE YOU UP,
OKAY?

04:41.549 --> 04:43.917
HEY, BOYD,
HERE COMES CARLOS HERNANDEZ.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.019
I CAN'T FIND ANY HAIRS.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.256
OKAY.
YELL WHAT I TOLD YOU TO.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.759
HEY, MR. HERNANDEZ!

04:51.792 --> 04:54.595
I TRAGICALLY ONLY HAVE
TWO WEEKS TO LIVE!

04:54.628 --> 04:55.663
(coughs)

04:55.696 --> 04:57.030
(laughs)

04:57.064 --> 05:00.133
HEY. HEY, THAT WAS
FOR MY NEPHEW.

05:00.167 --> 05:03.337
YEAH. IT LOOKED LIKE
IT WAS GOING TO THE KID,

05:03.371 --> 05:07.107
AND THEN SOMEBODY JUST
TOOK IT AWAY FROM HIM.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.310
KINDA LIKE THE MALL JOB.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.346
BILL,
GIVE THE KID THE BALL.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.782
I DON'T THINK SO, MIKE.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.018
ARE WE GONNA GO THERE?

05:18.051 --> 05:19.520
SIR, WHATEVER HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND MR. BAXTER,

05:19.553 --> 05:21.555
PLEASE DON'T TAKE IT OUT
ON MY KID. COME ON.
(sighs)

05:21.589 --> 05:23.190
GOT FIVE SECONDS
TO GIVE HIM THE BALL.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.358
OR WHAT?!

05:24.392 --> 05:27.027
OOH!
GRANDPA!

05:27.060 --> 05:28.962
(scoffs)

05:28.996 --> 05:31.999
(Boyd) MOMMY!

05:32.032 --> 05:34.001
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.
HEY.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.403
HOW WAS IT?

05:35.436 --> 05:36.537
(door closes)
GRANDMA, I GOT A BALL.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.407
WOW. LOOK AT THAT.
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.042
YEAH.
RYAN, WHY DOES HE SMELL
LIKE A BREWERY?

05:42.075 --> 05:44.845
THIS OBNOXIOUS DRUNK SPILLED
HIS BEER ON BOYD

05:44.878 --> 05:47.247
AND THEN GOT A FISTFUL OF
"DON'T MESS WITH OUR FAMILY."

05:47.280 --> 05:49.417
BOO-YAH! RIGHT IN THE FACE.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.519
MIKE? HONEY.
(Mike) HUH?

05:51.552 --> 05:52.853
YOU HIT A STRANGER?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.187
NO, NO, NO. BILL McKENDREE.
NO?

05:54.221 --> 05:56.824
A FRIEND? HONEY!

05:56.857 --> 05:58.191
YOU DON'T GO AROUND
PUNCHING PEOPLE.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.461
I DIDN'T PUNCH HIM. RYAN DID.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.866
RYAN?
RYAN?

06:05.899 --> 06:08.569
YEAH. ON THIS DAY,

06:08.602 --> 06:12.873
MY FOURTH DAUGHTER
BECAME A MAN.

06:14.408 --> 06:17.878
OKAY, YOU GOT INTO A FIGHT
AT A BALL GAME?

06:17.911 --> 06:20.247
LOOK, THIS GUY
GOT IN BOYD'S FACE.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.582
AND I TRIED
TO MOVE HIM AWAY,

06:21.615 --> 06:24.752
AND HE SHOVED ME,
AND I HAD NO CHOICE.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.420
SO I PUNCHED HIM.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.788
YOU HAD NO CHOICE?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.089
MR. McKENDREE'S REALLY HIT
THE SKIDS.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.290
AND THEN HE HIT THE GROUND,

06:30.323 --> 06:32.025
THANKS TO SUGAR RAY VOGELSON
HERE.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.795
OKAY, YOU WON'T LET BOYD
WATCH "TOM AND JERRY"

06:34.828 --> 06:37.397
BECAUSE IT'S VIOLENT,
BUT PUNCHING PEOPLE IS FINE?

06:37.431 --> 06:39.099
FIRST OFF, "TOM AND JERRY"
IS OBJECTIONABLE

06:39.132 --> 06:41.569
BECAUSE IT PERPETUATES
CAT STEREOTYPES.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.272
WHAT?
WHAT?

06:45.305 --> 06:46.940
LOOK, I WAS RIGHT
TO HIT THIS GUY.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.576
HE WAS OUT OF CONTROL.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.712
SO BOYD LEARNED THAT VIOLENCE
IS THE WAY TO SETTLE DISPUTES?

06:51.745 --> 06:55.716
OH, LOOK, THE ONLY THING THAT
BOYD MIGHT HAVE LEARNED TODAY

06:55.749 --> 06:57.117
IS THAT IF YOU PUSH
HIS OLD MAN TOO FAR,

06:57.150 --> 06:58.952
YOU'RE PUTTING
YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH

06:58.986 --> 07:01.822
IN SUBSTANTIAL... PERIL.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.560
YOU'RE, LIKE,
TERRIBLE AT THIS.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.929
HONEY, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
CALL SECURITY?

07:08.962 --> 07:10.397
IT HAPPENED SO FAST,
AND SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY

07:10.430 --> 07:12.800
TO DEAL WITH A BULLY
IS POP 'EM IN THE NOSE.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.468
ALTHOUGH, IDEALLY, WITHOUT
SHAKING YOUR HAND AFTERWARDS,

07:14.502 --> 07:16.904
SAYING,
"OUCH, OW! OWIE! OWIE! OW!"

07:16.937 --> 07:20.273
(phone rings)

07:20.307 --> 07:21.775
(ring)

07:21.809 --> 07:24.277
IS THAT A PHONE?

07:24.311 --> 07:26.079
YEAH, IT'S CALLED A LANDLINE.
(ring)

07:26.113 --> 07:27.080
(gasps) I FORGOT
THAT WE HAVE THAT.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.249
DAD, IT'S PROBABLY FOR ME.
(ring)

07:29.282 --> 07:30.283
YOU CAN'T TALK TO ANYBODY
ON THE PHONE

07:30.317 --> 07:32.119
TILL YOU BRING
YOUR HISTORY GRADE UP.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.154
OH! MOM, PLEASE.
I BEG OF YOU.
(Vanessa) NO, NO. NO.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.189
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME
WHERE YOU HID MY COMPUTER.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.491
HOW ELSE AM I SUPPOSED
TO DOWNLOAD--

07:37.525 --> 07:40.160
I MEAN, WRITE A TERM PAPER,
HUH?

07:40.193 --> 07:42.362
HONEY, THE INTERNET WILL
STILL BE THERE WHEN YOU'RE DONE,

07:42.395 --> 07:44.665
AND FRAT BOYS WILL STILL BE
CHOKING ON CINNAMON,

07:44.698 --> 07:48.936
AND KITTIES WILL STILL
"WANTS TO HAS CHEEZBURGERS."

07:48.969 --> 07:50.871
THEY'D BETTER.

07:50.904 --> 07:51.872
SO YOU REALLY DON'T SEE
ANYTHING WRONG

07:51.905 --> 07:53.306
WITH WHAT YOU DID TODAY?

07:53.340 --> 07:56.009
NO. A DRUNK LEARNED A LESSON,
AND BOYD GOT A BALL.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.946
AND I GOT ON THE JUMBOTRON.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.514
EVERYONE GOT TO ENJOY
THE GAME.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.315
WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE?

08:02.349 --> 08:03.984
THAT WAS THE DENVER POLICE
ON THE PHONE.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.787
AH. I BET THEY KNOW
WHAT THE DOWNSIDE IS.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.967
(sighs and whimpers)

08:20.000 --> 08:22.736
LAPTOPPY? WHERE ARE YOU?

08:23.871 --> 08:25.172
MANDY?
WHAT?

08:25.205 --> 08:26.840
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

08:26.874 --> 08:29.610
JUST CHECKING ON MY PIE.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.046
NOPE, STILL NOT IN THERE.
(closes oven door)

08:33.080 --> 08:37.851
WOW, SHE IS REALLY JONESING
FOR HER PHONE AND LAPTOP.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.252
YEAH, I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

08:39.286 --> 08:43.957
(sighs) NOW I WANT PIE.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.897
(closes oven door)

08:49.930 --> 08:52.566
YEAH, I KNEW IT WAS A LONG SHOT.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.035
HONEY, IS THIS POLICE THING
SERIOUS?

08:55.068 --> 08:56.604
I MEAN, SHOULD WE BE GETTING
RYAN A LAWYER?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.706
NO, NO, NO, THEY CALLED TO SEE
IF HE WOULD MAKE AN APPOINTMENT

08:58.739 --> 09:00.073
TO GO SEE HIM.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.109
(scoffs) IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN,

09:02.142 --> 09:03.043
PEPPER-SPRAYING HIM,
AND HITTING HIM

09:03.076 --> 09:05.045
LIKE HE'S A PIÑATA.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.179
YOU SOUND DISAPPOINTED.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.415
I AM. YOU PAY
THE POLICE SALARIES,

09:08.448 --> 09:10.718
YOU EXPECT
A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SERVICE.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.219
HE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.121
HE WAS JUST PROTECTING
HIS FAMILY, HONEY.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.355
SO YOU'RE PROUD OF HIM.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.757
DAMN RIGHT I'M PROUD OF HIM.
YOU ARE.

09:16.790 --> 09:17.758
NOW I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT HIM LEAVING THE HOUSE

09:17.791 --> 09:19.092
WITH MY DAUGHTER
AND MY GRANDSON,

09:19.126 --> 09:20.560
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

09:20.594 --> 09:21.962
YEAH, WELL,
I DON'T WANT HIM TO END UP

09:21.995 --> 09:23.196
BEING THE KIND OF GUY THAT GETS
INTO FIGHTS ALL THE TIME.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.197
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IN 23 YEARS

09:24.231 --> 09:26.266
THE KID'S MADE A FIST.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.703
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU COUNT HIM
LOOKING AT HIS NAILS.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.904
RIGHT.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.807
I MEAN, COME ON.
THE GUY--HE LOST CONTROL.

09:33.841 --> 09:34.808
HE DIDN'T LOSE ANY CONTROL.
HE DID. HE SO LOST CONTROL.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.076
HE SET A BOUNDARY.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.645
THAT'S HOW YOU BUILD
A POLITE SOCIETY...
MM-HMM.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.346
THROUGH VIOLENCE.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.753
(singsongy) LAPTOPPY?

09:45.786 --> 09:47.821
(switch clicks)
LAPTOPPY?

09:47.855 --> 09:51.124
SMARTPHONEY?

09:51.158 --> 09:53.093
WHERE ARE YOU?

09:54.127 --> 09:56.463
YES! A COMPUTER!

09:58.198 --> 09:59.399
DAMN IT.
THE MONITOR'S MISSING.

09:59.432 --> 10:05.105
(Ed over radio)
KA0XTT, this is WB0ASQ,

10:05.138 --> 10:06.473
Papa Yankee eight.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.507
(radio chatter)

10:07.540 --> 10:09.743
HELLO?

10:09.777 --> 10:12.079
WHO'S THERE?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.981
(static crackles)
Mike, do you read me?

10:14.014 --> 10:16.316
(Kyle) Hey, Mr. Alzate,
this is Kyle, KD0XCS.
KYLE!

10:16.349 --> 10:18.118
KYLE! KYLE!

10:18.151 --> 10:20.453
YEAH, UH, WHERE'S MIKE?

10:20.487 --> 10:22.022
UH, UH, HE'S NOT
IN THE OFFICE, SIR.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.757
HOW'S THE RAIN FOREST?

10:23.791 --> 10:26.559
WERE YOU ABLE TO USE THAT
AMAZON GIFT CARD I GOT YOU?

10:33.967 --> 10:39.172
NO. UH... THAT'S
A DIFFERENT AMAZON, SON.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.974
KYLE, KYLE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
KYLE?

10:41.008 --> 10:44.044
Tell Mike I'm really bonding
with one of the local tribes.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.645
THEY JUST STABBED ME
WITH A FORK

10:45.679 --> 10:48.048
COVERED WITH FROG VENOM.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.383
(static whines)
This is part
of a tribal ceremony

10:50.417 --> 10:52.319
TO MAKE ME A BETTER HUNTER,
YOU SEE?

10:52.352 --> 10:57.124
WOW, I'M SUDDENLY...
FEELING RATHER WEIRD HERE.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.060
WELL, EITHER THAT--THAT VENOM
HAS--HAS PSYCHEDELIC PROPERTIES,

11:00.093 --> 11:01.862
OR THOSE SPIDER MONKEYS
OUTSIDE

11:01.895 --> 11:06.333
ARE ACTUALLY--ACTUALLY SINGING
SIDE TWO OF "ABBEY ROAD."

11:06.366 --> 11:08.035
I GOTTA GO.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.137
(switch clicks)
KYLE, CAN YOU HEAR ME? KYLE?

11:10.170 --> 11:13.140
WOW, MR. ALZATE, WHEN--
WHEN YOU'RE ON FROG VENOM,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.743
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE MANDY.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.177
SAY SOMETHING SHE WOULD SAY.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.678
(switch clicks)
KYLE, IT'S ME, MANDY!

11:18.712 --> 11:20.647
(laughs)

11:20.680 --> 11:23.083
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.152
(clicks switch)
NO, SERIOUSLY, I-IT'S ME.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.354
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN
SO DESPERATE TO TALK TO YOU.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.056
(clicks switch)
OH, MANDY, I WAS WORRIED.
I DIDN'T HEAR FROM YOU.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.490
YOU DIDN'T RETURN
ANY OF MY TEXTS.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.759
(clicks switch)
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.361
MY PARENTS TOOK AWAY
MY PHONE AND MY COMPUTER.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.230
OH. I THOUGHT YOU DUMPED ME.
I WAS SO BUMMED.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.666
MY--MY ROOMMATE SET ME UP
WITH HIS SISTER TONIGHT.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.602
SHE'S SWEET, BUT SHE LOOKS
DISTURBINGLY LIKE MY ROOMMATE

11:42.635 --> 11:45.172
IN A DRESS.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.539
(man) Be careful, Kyle.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.341
I made that mistake once.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.177
By the time I figured it out,

11:50.210 --> 11:52.980
I was too revved up
to hit the brakes.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.685
I'M SORRY.
WHO'S TALKING?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.053
Well, I'm Walter.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.122
Whiskey, Four,
Uniform, Uniform, Echo,

12:02.155 --> 12:04.457
from Lehigh Acres, Florida.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.928
(woman) Mandy, you can do better
than this Kyle fellow.

12:07.961 --> 12:11.131
He sounds short.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.465
(clicks switch)
HE'S NOT SHORT.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.967
I AM NOT SHORT.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.235
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?

12:15.268 --> 12:16.970
(clicks switch)
MANDY, THAT'S HOW
HAM RADIO WORKS.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.571
RIGHT NOW THERE COULD BE
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

12:18.605 --> 12:21.074
ALL OVER THE WORLD LISTENING
TO EVERY WORD YOU SAY.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.075
(clicks switch)
Really?

12:22.109 --> 12:24.912
SO BASICALLY,
IT'S EXACTLY LIKE TWITTER

12:24.945 --> 12:27.981
BUT MORE ADVANCED BECAUSE
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TYPE!

12:28.015 --> 12:31.051
(gasps) THIS IS THE GREATEST
THING TO EVER HAPPEN TO ME.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.020
(clicks switch)

12:35.923 --> 12:38.158
I'M REALLY SORRY,
MISS CLEVENGER,

12:38.191 --> 12:40.660
ABOUT BOYD MISSING SCHOOL
YESTERDAY.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.996
IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

12:43.030 --> 12:46.333
TODAY BOYD DREW THESE PICTURES
IN CLASS.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.935
HERE'S BOYD SMILING.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.904
OH.
AND HERE'S YOU SMILING.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.606
AND HERE'S HIS FATHER BEATING
THE CRAP OUT OF SOMEONE...

12:55.208 --> 12:56.910
AND SMILING.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.812
WOW.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.514
THAT IS A LOT OF BLOOD.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.251
HE USED
THE ENTIRE RED CRAYON.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.454
IS THERE ANYTHING
THE SCHOOL SHOULD BE AWARE OF

13:07.487 --> 13:09.322
INVOLVING BOYD'S FATHER?

13:09.356 --> 13:12.325
HI. SORRY. I RUSHED OVER HERE
AS SOON AS I COULD.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.693
AH, I'D SHAKE YOUR HAND,

13:13.726 --> 13:14.761
BUT I WAS JUST GETTING
FINGERPRINTED

13:14.794 --> 13:16.729
DOWN AT THE POLICE STATION,
SO...

13:18.631 --> 13:21.168
COPS, RIGHT?

13:21.201 --> 13:26.039
UH, BOYD DREW THIS PICTURE
OF YOU HITTING THAT GUY.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.442
THAT'S A GOOD LIKENESS,
BUDDY.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.544
THIS ONE'S GONNA GO
RIGHT ON THE FRIDGE.

13:31.578 --> 13:35.849
SO...
THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED?

13:35.883 --> 13:37.851
OH, YEAH, WELL, THERE WAS
THIS IDIOT AT THE BALL GAME,

13:37.885 --> 13:39.486
SO I HAD TO STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT.

13:39.519 --> 13:40.620
I MEAN, THERE WASN'T
THIS MUCH BLOOD,

13:40.653 --> 13:42.956
BUT, YOU KNOW, KIDS, RIGHT?

13:42.990 --> 13:46.159
UH, MISS CLEVENGER
IS CONCERNED.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.495
OH, YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.865
WE, UH, WE WON'T BE HEARING
FROM THAT GUY ANYTIME SOON.

13:51.899 --> 13:55.002
MR. VOGELSON,

13:55.035 --> 13:58.338
BOYD SEEMS TO VIEW YOU
AS VIOLENT AND SCARY.

13:59.739 --> 14:02.009
WHAT? NO. THAT'S--
THAT'S CRAZY.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.810
BOYD, COME HERE.
DADDY NEEDS TO TALK TO YOU.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.047
IF I DON'T,
ARE YOU GONNA PUNCH ME?

14:07.080 --> 14:09.816
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.051
I'M SORRY.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.053
BOYD, YOU'RE NOT SCARED OF ME.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.988
OKAY, I'M NOT SCARED
OF YOU.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.924
GOOD, THEN COME GIVE ME A HUG.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.033
THAT'S THE BEST WE CAN DO.

14:26.066 --> 14:29.302
WE'RE, UH... SCANDINAVIAN.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.108
I'M JUST GONNA KEEP THESE
ON FILE.

14:42.950 --> 14:45.585
(woman) And then he picked up
the check for our meal.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.521
IF HE PAYS FOR DINNER,
HE'S A WINNER.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.391
(clicks switch)
#MANDY-ISM.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.227
OH, UM, YOU CAN PUT THAT
OUT THERE ON THE HAM-ISPHERE.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.729
FEEL FREE TO RE-HAM THAT ONE.
(clicks switch)

14:56.763 --> 14:59.232
Then after dinner,
we took a lovely stroll

14:59.266 --> 15:00.700
through the cemetery,

15:00.733 --> 15:03.470
and we made out
on his wife's grave.

15:03.503 --> 15:08.108
(elderly man) Does that count
as a threesome?

15:08.141 --> 15:11.711
(laughs) LOL.
Is that right, Mandy?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.981
LOL?

15:14.014 --> 15:16.950
UH, WOW, MANDY,
THIS IS REALLY... FUN.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.952
UH...

15:18.986 --> 15:21.454
BUT I WAS WONDERING WHEN
I COULD SEE YOU IN PRIVATE.

15:21.488 --> 15:25.058
After she finishes
her history paper, Kyle.

15:25.092 --> 15:28.161
(clicks switch)
GUYS, I'M SERIOUSLY NEVER
GOING TO FINISH THIS PAPER.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.463
I KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT WORLD WAR II.
(clicks switch)

15:30.497 --> 15:33.967
(Walter) I know a little bit.
I was on the beach in Omaha.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.136
(clicks switch)
THAT'S GREAT, WALTER,
BUT MY PAPER'S ON THE WAR,

15:36.169 --> 15:38.105
NOT ON YOUR NEBRASKA VACATION.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.273
(clicks switch)

15:40.307 --> 15:43.410
(elderly woman) I remember
the war like it was yesterday.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.845
In fact, a lot better
than yesterday.

15:45.878 --> 15:49.749
I'm in the early stages
of dementia.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.952
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU
WITH YOUR PAPER, TOO, MANDY.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.122
REALLY, MR. ALZATE?
(birds calling)

15:55.155 --> 15:57.357
YEAH, I MET A FELLOW DOWN HERE
IN BRAZIL

15:57.390 --> 15:59.292
WITH LOTS OF
FANTASTIC WAR STORIES.

15:59.326 --> 16:04.797
HE'S 92, BITTER,
AND SPEAKS WITH A GERMAN ACCENT.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.867
YOU DO THE MATH.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.806
HEY.
HEY!

16:13.840 --> 16:16.309
HEY! HI, SWEETIE. MWAH.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.710
(door closes)

16:17.744 --> 16:19.279
RYAN, THINGS GETTING
ANY BETTER WITH BOYD?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.714
NO. HE'S STILL TERRIFIED
OF ME.
(Vanessa) AW.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.116
IT'S JUST GONNA TAKE
SOME TIME, OKAY?

16:23.150 --> 16:24.184
HE'LL GET OVER IT.
(pats shoulder)

16:24.217 --> 16:25.518
I'M SORRY, RYAN.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.686
DON'T BE SORRY.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.121
HE'S GOT BOYD
RIGHT WHERE HE WANTS HIM.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.556
NO, HE DOESN'T.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.824
HONEY, PARENTS WANT LOVE
AND TRUST FROM THEIR CHILDREN,

16:31.858 --> 16:32.892
NOT FEAR.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.362
AH, I KINDA WANT IT ALL.

16:35.395 --> 16:39.132
MIKE, I DON'T WANT BOYD
TO OBEY ME

16:39.166 --> 16:40.500
BECAUSE HE'S SCARED OF ME.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.135
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE HIT
McKENDREE.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.071
LET'S NOT GO CRAZY HERE.
YOU FINALLY GREW A PAIR.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.173
PUNCHING THAT GUY WAS

16:46.206 --> 16:47.507
THE COOLEST THING
YOU'VE EVER DONE.

16:47.540 --> 16:51.144
YOU KNOW, ADMITTEDLY,
YOU'VE SET THE BAR KINDA LOW.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.046
NO, DON'T LISTEN TO HIM,
RYAN.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.515
IT TAKES A BIG MAN
TO ADMIT HE'S WRONG.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.917
TAKES A BIG MAN
TO HIT A BIGGER MAN.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.187
NO, I'M GONNA TAKE BOYD
TO THE NEXT GAME,

17:00.220 --> 17:02.021
AND HE CAN SEE ME
APOLOGIZE TO McKENDREE.

17:02.055 --> 17:02.989
GOOD.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.757
BOY,
AS SOON AS THEY DROP,

17:04.791 --> 17:07.727
THEY SCURRY RIGHT BACK UP
INSIDE HIM.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.564
BOYD, TURN OFF THE CARTOONS
AND GO WASH UP FOR DINNER.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.100
(cartoon playing on TV)
I DON'T WANT TO.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.434
BOYD, LISTEN TO YOUR MOM.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.270
SORRY, SORRY, SORRY!

17:17.304 --> 17:18.771
(footsteps depart rapidly)

17:18.805 --> 17:21.941
NOW WHAT PARENT
WOULDN'T WANT THAT?

17:21.974 --> 17:27.214
HUH? I SHOULD DECK SOMEBODY
IN FRONT OF MANDY.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.682
HONEY, YOU'LL BE
THE FUN PARENT AGAIN SOON, OKAY?

17:29.716 --> 17:31.184
I PROMISE.

17:31.218 --> 17:34.154
(sighs)

17:43.163 --> 17:45.031
HEY, BOYD,
CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND THERE?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.032
THANKS, GRANDPA.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.267
USE A LITTLE MORE HOT WATER.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.036
IT'S SO COLD, HUH?
LATHER UP A LITTLE BIT.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.439
WHY DO I HAVE TO WASH
MY HANDS SO MUCH?

17:52.472 --> 17:54.073
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
PICK YOUR NOSE SO MUCH?

17:54.107 --> 17:56.443
(chuckles)

17:56.476 --> 18:01.881
SOAP PROTECTS YOUR HANDS
FROM GERMS,

18:01.914 --> 18:04.251
LIKE YOUR DAD PROTECTS YOU
FROM EVERYTHING ELSE.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.586
MY DAD CAN BE
PRETTY SCARY.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.155
YOUR DAD'S NOT SCARY.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.758
HIS LEFT WING POLICIES--
THEY'RE SCARY.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.059
BUT THAT'S JUST 'CAUSE
HE'S A FOOT SOLDIER

18:13.092 --> 18:14.261
FOR GEORGE SOROS.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.595
(turns off faucet)

18:15.628 --> 18:17.297
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.066
I DON'T EITHER.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.067
LISTEN, THE REASON

18:21.100 --> 18:22.569
YOUR DAD HIT THAT BAD GUY
AT THE BASEBALL GAME

18:22.602 --> 18:23.936
IS HE JUST DIDN'T WANT
THAT BAD GUY TO HURT YOU.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.672
THAT'S WHAT
THAT WAS ALL ABOUT.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.940
SO HE ONLY HITS
BAD PEOPLE?

18:27.974 --> 18:29.909
HE ONLY HURTS BAD PEOPLE
WHEN THEY MIGHT BE HURTING YOU.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.512
YOUR DAD IS A REALLY NICE MAN.
HE WOULD NEVER HURT YOU.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.515
YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO?
I WOULD GO DOWN AND HUG MY DAD

18:35.548 --> 18:37.350
AND SAY, "I LOVE YOU
FOR TAKING CARE OF ME."

18:37.384 --> 18:39.486
OKAY.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.687
YEAH. YOU'RE A GOOD KID, BOYD.
YOU REALLY ARE.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.021
THANKS, GRANDPA.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.591
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KINDA GOTTA BE A GOOD KID.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.660
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR DAD'S CAPABLE OF.

18:53.032 --> 18:56.169
(organ playing)
HERE WE GO, PEOPLE.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.171
HE'S BACK, AND HE COULD GO OFF
AT ANY MINUTE.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.973
(crowd cheering)

19:01.007 --> 19:03.009
OKAY. OKAY, OKAY.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.377
REGARDING THE INCIDENT
THAT HAPPENED LAST GAME,

19:04.411 --> 19:06.513
FRANKLY, IT'S DISAPPOINTING
THAT SO MANY OF YOU

19:06.546 --> 19:08.381
FOUND THAT ENTERTAINING.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.682
(chanting) KILLER...

19:09.716 --> 19:10.950
(crowd joins in chanting)
KILLER! KILLER! KILLER!

19:10.983 --> 19:12.552
OKAY, COULD YOU PLEASE
JUST KNOCK IT OFF?

19:12.585 --> 19:14.354
(crowd) OOH!

19:14.387 --> 19:15.522
SORRY.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.156
JUST TRYING TO MY SON
A LESSON.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.158
WELL, IT WON'T BE THE FIRST TIME
YOU TAUGHT SOMEONE A LESSON

19:19.192 --> 19:20.993
AROUND HERE, RIGHT? HUH?

19:21.027 --> 19:23.029
(cheering)

19:23.062 --> 19:27.967
HEY! LOOK WHO IT IS!
IT'S MIKE BAXTER AND HIS GOON!

19:28.000 --> 19:30.503
(slurring)
NICE SUCKER PUNCH, GOON.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.004
GREAT. HE'S DRUNK AGAIN.

19:32.038 --> 19:35.174
GREAT.
HE'S DRUNK AGAIN.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.376
(normal voice)
OH, NO, GUYS, GUYS.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.677
I-I WAS JUST MESSING
WITH YOU.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.046
I HAVE NOT HAD A DRINK
SINCE OPENING DAY.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.549
MIKE, AH, I OWE YOU AND YOUR
WHOLE FAMILY AN APOLOGY.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.150
I AM SO SORRY.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.918
I-I HOPE YOU CAN
FORGIVE ME.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.387
YOU GONNA TAKE
THIS CRAP FROM HIM?
SHH.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.156
YEAH, AND I'M GONNA DROP
THE ASSAULT CHARGES.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.658
WELL, THANK YOU, MR. McKENDREE,
BUT HONESTLY,

19:51.691 --> 19:53.860
I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD BE
APOLOGIZING TO YOU.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.195
WHY? I WAS A HUGE JERK.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.230
BUT I STILL SHOULDN'T
HAVE HIT YOU.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.331
THAT WAS NOT THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.866
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:59.899 --> 20:02.034
YOU KNOCKED ME SOBER.
I OWE YOU, MAN.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.670
I SHOULD HAVE HANDLED IT
MORE PEACEFULLY.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.873
YOU HANDLED IT EXACTLY RIGHT.
WILL YOU PLEASE JUST LET ME
APOLOGIZE?!

20:06.906 --> 20:09.242
(crowd) OOH.
OKAY, OKAY.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.944
SORRY. I'M JUST TRYING
TO TEACH MY SON SOMETHING.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.079
YOU TAUGHT YOUR SON
A GREAT LESSON.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.114
BOYD, IF YOU HIT
SOMEBODY HARD ENOUGH,

20:15.147 --> 20:17.250
THEY TURN
INTO A BETTER PERSON.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.751
THAT'S NOT THE LESSON, MIKE.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.119
HEY.
WHOA-HO-HO-HO!

20:20.152 --> 20:21.788
THERE'S THAT TEMPER, FOLKS.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.356
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
EVE. EVE...

20:23.390 --> 20:24.924
(crowd chanting) FIGHT!
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

20:24.957 --> 20:27.460
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. BOYD, COME ON.
WE'RE OUTTA HERE.

20:27.494 --> 20:28.595
NO, NO. COME ON, COME ON.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.029
STAY. STAY.
NO.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.130
ENJOY THE GAME.
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT
ALL OF YOU.

20:31.163 --> 20:34.401
THERE'LL BE NO PUNCHING,
YOU BLOODTHIRSTY...

20:34.434 --> 20:35.535
JACKALS!
(smack)

20:35.568 --> 20:37.570
(crowd gasps and murmurs)

20:37.604 --> 20:38.805
(cheering)

20:38.838 --> 20:41.073
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.542
LET ME SEE IF I CAN'T GET
THAT APPOINTMENT

20:42.575 --> 20:44.544
WITH THE POLICE STATION.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.620
MANDY, HONEY, THIS PAPER
YOU WROTE IS REALLY GOOD.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.987
ALL THESE PERSONAL ACCOUNTS

20:55.021 --> 20:56.423
OF PEOPLE WHO LIVED
THROUGH THE WAR.
MM-HMM.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.325
YOU KNOW, I ESPECIALLY LIKE
THIS GUY WALTER

20:58.358 --> 21:00.393
WHO LANDED
ON OMAHA BEACH.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.128
WHICH IS IN FRANCE,
NOT NEBRASKA,

21:02.161 --> 21:05.097
AS MANY PEOPLE
MISTAKENLY BELIEVE.

21:05.131 --> 21:08.335
OKAY. SEE HOW MUCH EASIER
IT IS TO FOCUS

21:08.368 --> 21:09.936
WHEN YOU'RE NOT WASTING
ALL YOUR TIME

21:09.969 --> 21:11.638
CHATTING WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

21:11.671 --> 21:13.740
YEAH, MOM, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I LEARNED

21:13.773 --> 21:16.309
FROM THIS ENTIRE EXPERIENCE.
(laughs)

21:16.343 --> 21:18.578
HERE. I WILL GET
YOUR COMPUTER,

21:18.611 --> 21:20.079
AND YOU CAN TYPE THIS UP.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.449
OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.
I ACTUALLY ALREADY TYPED IT UP

21:22.482 --> 21:23.783
ON THAT KEYBOARD
I FOUND IN THE BASEMENT.

21:23.816 --> 21:26.018
SO... JUST WAITING
FOR IT TO PRINT.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.890
IT'S TAKING FOREVER,
THOUGH.
