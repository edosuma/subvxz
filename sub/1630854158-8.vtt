00:09.010 --> 00:11.659
Everything here

Upcycling is at the very core
of the modern maker movement.

00:15.165 --> 00:17.090
It's very responsible.

00:17.092 --> 00:19.426

made out of...

00:19.428 --> 00:21.169
used retainers?

Hey, guys.
You're craft fair fans, too?

00:27.194 --> 00:30.087
Ew, no. We're doing
a photo scavenger hunt

00:30.089 --> 00:31.846
for Francine's birthday party.

00:31.848 --> 00:33.924
We need a picture
of something sad.

00:33.926 --> 00:35.850
I wonder why I wasn't invited.

00:35.852 --> 00:39.872
'Cause you're a party narc
who ruins everybody's fun.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.541
What?
When have I ever done that?

00:42.543 --> 00:45.377
You once deflated a bouncy house
'cause you smelled mildew.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.528
You shut down a pool party

00:46.530 --> 00:48.288
'cause the diving board
wasn't code.

00:48.290 --> 00:49.548
You stopped a barbecue

00:49.550 --> 00:51.884
because the fire extinguishers
were expired.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.944
Okay, okay, I get it.

00:53.946 --> 00:55.629
Basically, you're a wet blanket.

00:55.631 --> 00:57.872
That's not true,
she's more like a blanket

00:57.874 --> 01:00.634
that tattles and kills all joy.

01:00.636 --> 01:02.377
Ooh, that's sad.

01:05.291 --> 01:08.141

01:08.143 --> 01:09.626
I'll take this.

01:09.628 --> 01:11.144
You'll need this polish.

01:11.146 --> 01:13.313
It's my blend
of secret ingredients,

01:13.315 --> 01:17.058
including carnauba wax.
That-that one's not a secret.

01:17.060 --> 01:18.802
Okay, I'll take both.

01:18.804 --> 01:20.137
I have to explain to the box

01:20.139 --> 01:21.896
that it's going
to live with you now.

01:21.898 --> 01:23.749
Okay, baby, you're gonna go...

Special lady? Since when?

01:49.501 --> 01:53.186
Oh. Oh, it's been
almost six months.

01:53.188 --> 01:55.114
And we're just
hearing about it now?

01:55.116 --> 01:58.358

I left you tons of messages.

when you were...

03:35.716 --> 03:38.366
Oh, he's adopted.

03:38.368 --> 03:42.387
Cute kid, but, man,

of balsamic, chef.

04:08.824 --> 04:11.308

04:11.310 --> 04:13.994

Well, I'm not
getting fennel at all.

04:25.173 --> 04:26.840

Don't be rude.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.659

04:29.661 --> 04:33.087
Well, they're both rodents,
but this little dude

04:33.089 --> 04:36.458
is a Sciuridae, or squirrel,
if you prefer.

04:36.460 --> 04:39.111
I'd prefer that it not
stare into my soul

04:39.113 --> 04:40.445

04:40.447 --> 04:44.283
Calvin does taxidermy.
That's one of his pieces.

04:44.285 --> 04:48.845
He's a rising star in the field.
He takes classes with adults.

04:48.847 --> 04:50.438

the tire tracks

04:50.440 --> 04:52.291

04:52.293 --> 04:54.518
Uhp, time for your
glocky-drops, Abe.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.630
Aw, that stuff makes me blinder
than an umpire in a mineshaft.

04:58.632 --> 05:02.801
You know the drill, commodore.
Head back, eyes open.

05:02.803 --> 05:06.196

Rain, rain.

05:06.198 --> 05:08.122
Windshield wipers!

05:08.124 --> 05:10.267

05:11.553 --> 05:13.720
Here you go, sweetie.

05:13.722 --> 05:18.132
We made that chestnut stuffing
I know you love.

05:18.134 --> 05:21.653

Abe, you're feeding
the thermostat again.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.323
D'oh! Damn glocky-drops!

05:25.492 --> 05:29.052
Yo, our grandfather
Abe Simpson moved out,

05:29.054 --> 05:31.330
but left his...
(shudders) denture cup.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.889
Do you have a lost and found?

05:32.891 --> 05:34.558
Please say you don't have
a lost and found.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.817
Oh, Abe's moved out?

05:35.819 --> 05:38.244
Well, his room is paid up
for the next two weeks.

05:38.246 --> 05:40.747
Uh, actually, I misspoke.

05:40.749 --> 05:44.992
Um, Abe is still using the room.
Using it like crazy.

05:44.994 --> 05:46.011
(Lisa exclaims)

05:46.013 --> 05:49.239
We own this place
for two whole weeks.

05:49.241 --> 05:51.091
-Hmm.
-We can take a shower
in a chair,

05:51.093 --> 05:53.518
-flush the toilet
a million times...
-Interesting.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.688
Oh, you're gonna tell Mom and
Dad about this, aren't you?

05:56.690 --> 06:00.859
Nope, this is one whistle
I'm not gonna blow.

06:00.861 --> 06:05.422
Instead,
what if we used this room

06:05.424 --> 06:08.592
to throw the greatest
slumber party ever?

06:08.594 --> 06:10.443
No rules, no limits,

06:10.445 --> 06:14.206
and, dare I say it,
no slumbering.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.208
(straining):
Tell me more.

06:18.361 --> 06:21.380
Also, that kid
is not that good of a cook.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.048
There's such a thing
as chicken being

06:23.050 --> 06:25.050
too tender and juicy, you know?

06:25.052 --> 06:28.553
Our wood is really loving
this carnauba stuff.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.798
And what kind of kid
does taxidermy?

06:31.800 --> 06:33.332
Dead animals are meant to be

06:33.334 --> 06:35.394
poked with a stick,
end of story.

06:35.396 --> 06:38.880
Homer, you've been complaining
about Calvin for three days.

06:38.882 --> 06:41.233
Why are you
so obsessed with him?

06:41.235 --> 06:43.627
What? I don't
think about him at all.

06:43.629 --> 06:47.054
But did you notice
how he asked to be excused?

06:47.056 --> 06:49.408
That speaks to
a guilty conscience.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.575
And another thing.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.318
(lisping):
Why is my tongue swelling up?

06:52.320 --> 06:54.562
-(gasps)
-What is this rash?

06:54.564 --> 06:56.473
Oh, my gosh.

06:56.475 --> 07:00.160
You must be having an allergic
reaction to the carnauba wax.

07:00.162 --> 07:02.570
Well, stop using it!

07:02.572 --> 07:05.757
I-I've rubbed it
into the floors, the windows.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.076
Every wood surface in the house
has been carnauba'd!

07:09.078 --> 07:11.096
It'll take weeks to dissipate!

07:11.098 --> 07:13.432
But where do I go to breathe?

07:13.434 --> 07:15.842
(groans)

07:15.844 --> 07:18.085
Yay, you're here.

07:18.087 --> 07:20.272
I was putting up
glow-in-the-dark stars.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.015
I'll let you
distribute the other half,

07:22.017 --> 07:24.276
since you're
kind of like my brother now.

07:24.278 --> 07:27.428
Brother? (scoffs)
I'm a grown man.

07:27.430 --> 07:30.507
Half?
This is barely a third. No fair!

07:30.509 --> 07:31.450
Dad!

07:36.031 --> 07:39.365
Okay, Harry Potter
chapter read, pillow fluffed...

07:53.198 --> 07:55.048
-Night, Calvin.
-(light switch clicks)

07:55.050 --> 07:59.126
Psst. Homer.
Want to play 20 questions?

07:59.128 --> 08:02.764
Okay.
Question number one: Shut up.

08:02.766 --> 08:04.465
(laughs) You're funny.

08:04.467 --> 08:06.042
We should go out
on our bikes tomorrow.

08:06.044 --> 08:09.303
I know this place by the nuclear
plant that has the best jumps.

08:09.305 --> 08:10.989
Oh, wait.
Did you bring your bike?

08:10.991 --> 08:13.383
I don't have a bike,
I have a car.

08:13.385 --> 08:15.552

at the nuclear plant,

08:15.554 --> 08:19.998
I work there
because I am a grown-up.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.893

at a restaurant,

08:23.895 --> 08:25.061
he gives the host my name,

08:25.063 --> 08:27.363
so I'm practically
a grown-up, too.

08:27.365 --> 08:29.341

You're a pants-wetting baby.

Bye, now.

10:00.325 --> 10:03.435
Drive away. Don't look back.

10:09.501 --> 10:12.335
Welcome to our pop-up sleepover.

10:12.337 --> 10:14.762
Do you have the "birthday gift"?

10:14.764 --> 10:17.523
One $25 gift card.

10:17.525 --> 10:19.159
(Bart chuckles)

10:20.528 --> 10:24.347
Take off your shoes,
we have unlimited bed-jumping.

10:24.349 --> 10:26.850
(laughing hysterically)

10:26.852 --> 10:29.035
I've never felt so alive!

10:29.037 --> 10:33.189
We got PG-13 movies,
rated "M" videogames.

10:33.191 --> 10:34.782
What if Mother calls?

10:34.784 --> 10:38.361
We got Milhouse in the closet
standing by. Guy's a pro.

10:38.363 --> 10:40.972
(imitating adult):
Oh, hello, Wendell's mom.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.125
Yes, I will remind him
to wear his night guard,

10:44.127 --> 10:47.270
because I am another parent.
(normal voice): Love you.

10:48.556 --> 10:53.877
Lis, take a moment.
We did this. You did this.

Driest of blankets.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.151
(car rattles)

11:10.153 --> 11:12.061
Must you hit every bump?

11:12.063 --> 11:13.062
(tires screech)

11:13.064 --> 11:14.063
-Oh!
-(car rattles)

11:14.065 --> 11:15.398
Oops.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.825
I make a million dollars a year.
Did you know that?

11:17.827 --> 11:19.585
-No, you don't.
-Oh, yeah?

11:19.587 --> 11:21.829
Then why do
I have a ton of DVDs?

11:21.831 --> 11:23.506
What's a DVD?

11:24.518 --> 11:27.243
Ugh, your car smells like
fried chicken.

11:27.245 --> 11:29.854
No,<i> I</i> smell like fried chicken.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.932
Can you breathe
through your mouth?

11:32.934 --> 11:35.084
Your nose is squeaky.

11:35.086 --> 11:38.029
(breathes loudly)

11:38.031 --> 11:39.698
(breathes louder)

11:39.700 --> 11:41.032
Yeah?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.776
(both breathing loudly)

11:43.778 --> 11:46.763
(both wheezing)

11:46.765 --> 11:48.665

(Calvin coughs)

11:51.861 --> 11:53.628
(Homer whimpers)

12:01.112 --> 12:04.797
Wow, Calvin, what a great start.

12:04.799 --> 12:08.301
But how would a pelican have
access to a freshwater fish?

12:08.303 --> 12:11.563
(laughs) Well, that's the joke!

12:11.565 --> 12:13.380
(sarcastic laughter)

12:13.382 --> 12:16.626
Oh, so funny to murder
innocent water birds.

12:16.628 --> 12:19.904
Uh, it died
of natural causes, ding-dong.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.131
I have a network
of park ranger friends

12:22.133 --> 12:23.633
who save dead animals for me.

12:23.635 --> 12:27.394
So you're not a psychopath,
just a weirdo. Got it.

12:27.396 --> 12:29.989
It's always sad
when an animal dies,

12:29.991 --> 12:33.977
but this pelican gets to
speak to the world as art.

12:33.979 --> 12:36.162
I was inspired to make this

12:36.164 --> 12:38.590
after Abe told me about
his time in the war.

12:38.592 --> 12:42.427
His stories are so cool,
but disturbing.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.669
I will not sit here

12:43.671 --> 12:47.098
and have you call
my father's stories cool!

12:47.100 --> 12:49.158
They're meandering and endless.

12:49.160 --> 12:52.829
I'm going to Moe's,
where people know what's boring.

12:52.831 --> 12:54.330
(scoffs)

12:54.332 --> 12:55.999
And it's not just taxidermy,

12:56.001 --> 12:58.443
Calvin's got
a million creepy hobbies.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.779
And my dad
thinks they're all great.

13:00.781 --> 13:04.765
When I was his age, I was
cleaning pool covers from below.

13:04.767 --> 13:08.286
Yeah, going house to house
with my scrub brush and Speedo.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.289
I stuck googly eyes on shells
and sold them at the beach.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.607
Till my dad
told me to knock it off

13:13.609 --> 13:15.794
because people would think
I was a freak.

13:15.796 --> 13:18.946
Yeah, my pop also
told me to lay low.

13:18.948 --> 13:20.614
Literally.
We were gravediggers.

13:20.616 --> 13:23.209
We took turns
sleeping in open graves.

13:23.211 --> 13:25.136
Heh. Nothin' builds character

13:25.138 --> 13:28.714
like waking up to a coffin
being lowered on top of youse.

13:28.716 --> 13:30.600
To unprocessed trauma.

13:33.129 --> 13:35.647
-Hi, Lisa!
-She waved to us!

13:35.649 --> 13:36.648
(both laughing)

13:36.650 --> 13:38.132
Our sleepover is a hit.

13:38.134 --> 13:39.892
We have the room
for one more weekend.

13:39.894 --> 13:42.228
We're gonna be
gift card thousand-aires.

13:42.230 --> 13:45.064
No, Bart, we have
to reinvest in our next party.

13:45.066 --> 13:46.491
We have to top ourselves.

13:46.493 --> 13:50.069
I'm thinking face painters,
walk-around SpongeBob,

13:50.071 --> 13:52.722
one of those pools
you can surf in.

13:52.724 --> 13:56.334
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you chain-sucking lollypops?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.077
Just need a little something

13:58.079 --> 14:00.004
'cause I didn't sleep much
last night.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.489
I was pricing
mashed potato stations.

14:02.491 --> 14:06.493
Lisa, in the non-weekend world,
you have to have a bedtime.

14:06.495 --> 14:08.996
I don't want to live in
the non-weekend world.

14:08.998 --> 14:11.332
We've only got one more chance

14:11.334 --> 14:14.686
to scrawl our names
across the slumber party sky.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.729
I'll sleep when I'm nine.

14:17.765 --> 14:19.357
(groans)

14:21.695 --> 14:25.512
(grunting)

14:25.514 --> 14:27.181
Hmm? Hmm.

14:27.183 --> 14:28.867
(imitating Calvin):
Look at me, I'm Calvin.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.202
I'm little but I use big words.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.188
Son, I know it's hard
sharing a room

14:34.190 --> 14:38.025
with someone so,
uh, different than you.

14:38.027 --> 14:41.421
But you've handled it
with grace and maturity.

14:42.774 --> 14:45.049
Anyway, I just wanted to say

14:45.051 --> 14:48.052
-I'm so proud of you... Calvin.
-(gasps)

14:48.054 --> 14:50.613
Ooh, aah, dah!

14:50.615 --> 14:54.893
I can't see a thing with
these glaucoma drops. (sighs)

14:54.895 --> 14:56.285
<i> HOMER:</i>
<i> He thinks I'm Calvin.</i>

14:56.287 --> 14:58.212
<i> Look at how he looks at him.</i>

14:58.214 --> 15:00.231
<i>He never looked at me that way.</i>

15:00.233 --> 15:02.825
Are you okay, kid?
You seem kind of quiet.

15:02.827 --> 15:05.403
(imitating Calvin): It's just...
I've never heard you say

15:05.405 --> 15:09.966
you were proud of me.
Ever. In my entire life.

15:09.968 --> 15:11.558
What are you talking about?

15:11.560 --> 15:14.728
I say that to you
all the time, Calvin.

15:14.730 --> 15:17.490
Oh. (laughs weakly)

15:17.492 --> 15:18.824
I forgot.

15:18.826 --> 15:20.251
(Grampa chuckles)

15:26.501 --> 15:30.094
Homer, you villain!
Do not harm that birdhouse.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.430
The nuthatches
did nothing to you!

15:32.432 --> 15:34.006
(sighs heavily)

15:34.008 --> 15:35.508
What's wrong with you?

15:35.510 --> 15:39.011
My dad kisses the butt
you walk on.

15:39.013 --> 15:41.180
I'd get it
if you were great at sports,

15:41.182 --> 15:44.333
or fixing cars,
or demolishing buildings,

15:44.335 --> 15:46.836
but you're just
a weird little kid.

15:46.838 --> 15:49.113
And my dad
hates weird little kids.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.024
At least... he sure hated me.

15:52.026 --> 15:55.269
Homer, Abe doesn't hate you.

15:55.271 --> 15:56.621
Oh, yeah? I'll show you.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.532
We got ten minutes
until his eyedrops wear off.

15:59.534 --> 16:01.626
(grunts)
You be me.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.463
Dad, do you have a second?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.633
Dang it, Homer. Do you think
I'm made of seconds?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.712
I was in the middle of a very
important word find puzzle.

16:12.714 --> 16:16.140
I was about to find the longest
diagonal of my career.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.458
Now what do you want?!

16:17.460 --> 16:18.977
Um, I-I...

16:18.979 --> 16:21.562
You, you, you nothing!

16:23.149 --> 16:25.984
Wow, that was harsh.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.561
Do you ever tell him
how he makes you feel?

16:28.563 --> 16:31.805
Kinda. I stuck him in the worst
nursing home I could find.

16:31.807 --> 16:33.566
Figured he'd
read between the lines.

16:33.568 --> 16:36.995
I think you need to find a new
way to express your feelings.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.831
It might need to be more
than just words.

16:39.833 --> 16:44.485
But my way with words be my
best moutha-ma-callits. Aw.

16:44.487 --> 16:47.321
You'll figure out a way
to get through to your dad.

16:47.323 --> 16:49.966
You just need to put on
your thinking cap.

16:56.999 --> 16:58.182
Where have you been?

16:58.184 --> 16:59.742
I had to get Band-Aids.

16:59.744 --> 17:01.761
Lewis got stabbed
with a juice box straw.

17:01.763 --> 17:05.189
Somebody fed the pony Pop Rocks
and he kicked out the TV.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.025
His poop is popping!

17:07.027 --> 17:09.694
(crashing, creaking)

17:09.696 --> 17:13.180
The climbing wall collapsed
onto the Reptile Rodeo.

17:13.182 --> 17:15.516
There's loose tails everywhere.

17:15.518 --> 17:19.746
I tried to throw a party,
but the party threw me.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.764
I'm putting a stop to this.

17:21.766 --> 17:23.023
Are you sure?

17:23.025 --> 17:24.417
You know
what that will make you.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.362
Hello? Yes,
I'd like to blow the whistle

17:28.364 --> 17:32.032
on an out-of-control party
at The Retirement Castle.

17:32.034 --> 17:36.629
Oh, my name?
It's Lisa Simpson, party narc.

17:37.632 --> 17:41.133
Well, the party's shut down,
kids are packing up their stuff.

17:41.135 --> 17:43.561
Great.
I'm sure they all hate me.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.621
-Yeah, probably.
-(sighs)

17:45.623 --> 17:48.900
I gotta dump the churro sugar
out of my shoes.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.886

-They've arrested Lisa!

17:52.888 --> 17:56.908
She's paying the ultimate price
for throwing the ultimate party.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.701
You're our hero, Lisa!

17:59.728 --> 18:00.769
(gasps)

18:01.730 --> 18:03.564
If you drive me home
with the siren on,

full of Snickers.

-Lisa, you're the best!
-You got this, Lisa!

Call your lawyer!

(indistinct chatter)

18:18.747 --> 18:21.824
There's some really
inspiring work here tonight.

18:22.844 --> 18:26.829
Yours is a blistering indictment
of American consumerism.

18:26.831 --> 18:28.664
I love how the middle joey

18:28.666 --> 18:30.424
is looking in
the opposite direction,

18:30.426 --> 18:33.111
as if imagining
a different future.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.947
Glad you got that.
I worried it was too subtle.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.557
Oh, it hit me
like a ton of bricks.

18:41.604 --> 18:45.348
Now, let's announce
tonight's winners.

18:45.350 --> 18:48.626
Hold on, there's one more entry!

18:48.628 --> 18:52.521
A strange man with an object
hidden under a pillowcase?

18:52.523 --> 18:55.691
Come on up!
I want to see this.

18:56.711 --> 18:59.545
I was told to find
a new way to communicate.

18:59.547 --> 19:03.532
My stepbrother Calvin expresses
his feelings through taxidermy,

19:03.534 --> 19:07.386
so I decided
I would do the same.

19:07.388 --> 19:10.148
That's not taxidermy, you idjit!

19:10.150 --> 19:13.800
But it's very deep. And... sad.

19:13.802 --> 19:17.713
The small shell pleading with
its eyes to the larger one.

19:17.715 --> 19:21.993
It is clearly about a son's need
for his father's approval.

19:21.995 --> 19:25.738
What? It's just two smelly
shells glued on a board.

19:25.740 --> 19:30.576
Abe, look at it.
Really look at it.

19:30.578 --> 19:31.894
Hmm.

(sniffles) What these shells are
saying, is that how you feel?

19:44.851 --> 19:48.093
You seem to love
being a dad to Calvin,

19:48.095 --> 19:52.506
but you hated
being a dad to me. (sobs)

19:52.508 --> 19:57.177
No, son, no.
See, when you were a kid,

19:57.179 --> 20:00.865
being a dad felt like
the end of my youth.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.092
But now with Calvin,

20:03.094 --> 20:06.278
it's my last chance
to feel young.

20:06.280 --> 20:10.950
Oh, so what you're saying is
no matter how old you are,

20:10.952 --> 20:15.028
it's only ever been about
what<i> you</i> need.

20:15.030 --> 20:17.790
You finally get me.

20:17.792 --> 20:20.443
It wasn't because
I was a bad kid.

20:20.445 --> 20:23.870
You're just horribly flawed.

20:23.872 --> 20:25.965
I am!

21:10.495 --> 21:13.271

another message.
