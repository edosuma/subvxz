You're the first face
they'll see on the poster.

11:35.707 --> 11:37.449
I'll bring a deck of cards.

11:38.316 --> 11:40.589
We can play hearts.
It'll be fun.

11:42.654 --> 11:44.324
- We'll fly private.
- Done.

11:44.434 --> 11:45.644
Yay.

11:48.420 --> 11:51.405
Kyle said she hasn't worked
at the Pizza Dome in weeks.

take a job like this?

She must really be in trouble.

11:56.108 --> 11:58.866
I just don't understand
why she didn't reach out to us.

12:02.438 --> 12:05.952
Zack's douchebag friends
were calling her Lacey.

12:06.186 --> 12:07.834
Paige, I think she's been
hiding this for a while.

12:07.969 --> 12:09.809
She made up a fake name.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.553
- Oh, my God.
- What?

12:13.639 --> 12:15.859
I was, I was on the phone
with her the other day

12:15.932 --> 12:18.577
and somebody in the background
called for Lacey.

12:18.747 --> 12:20.655
And I.. Oh, my God.

12:20.724 --> 12:23.600
I've been so consumed
in this stupid movie

12:23.665 --> 12:26.545
and Wyatt always yelling at me
all the time that I..

12:29.124 --> 12:32.850
It was right in front of my face
and I didn't even see it.

12:34.374 --> 12:35.858

12:36.007 --> 12:38.887
Hey, I didn't know either.

12:40.145 --> 12:41.910
I had no clue.

12:42.349 --> 12:46.050
Where would Cassie go if she was
trying to escape everything?

12:49.465 --> 12:51.020
You better not have cheaped-out
in the meal service.

12:51.179 --> 12:53.309
- Never.
- Alright.

like a half hour, if that.

- Okay.

You better leave your picky
eating habits in the US, Alan.

15:56.647 --> 15:58.858
You just better let me do
the talking because the Chinese

15:58.939 --> 16:01.046
regard patience and politeness
above other qualities.

been gone for a few hours.'

starting to get worried.

18:01.287 --> 18:04.264
- Car sickness is psychosomatic.
- Cruel. Cruel woman.

18:04.365 --> 18:05.773
Motion sickness is miserable.

18:05.850 --> 18:07.501
Take it from a guy
who travels a lot.

18:07.631 --> 18:10.329
Thank you. I've been
telling her that for years.

18:10.365 --> 18:12.951

on roller coasters, boats.

18:13.209 --> 18:14.170
'Me either.'

18:14.342 --> 18:16.522

into this Alaskan cruise

18:16.647 --> 18:18.290
but I only lasted a night.

18:18.420 --> 18:20.318
Had to wait it in a motel
in Ketchikan

18:20.428 --> 18:22.312
while she saw eagles
and whales and bears.

18:22.352 --> 18:25.312
Oh, my! Everybody
gets motion sickness.

18:25.381 --> 18:27.123

it was psychosomatic.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.208
Yeah, for you.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.475
Yeah, well, since then

18:30.639 --> 18:33.029
I take it with me
everywhere I go.

18:33.271 --> 18:35.350
- Here you go.
- Pathetic.

18:39.182 --> 18:41.932
Hey, Adam,
um, you haven't talked

18:42.018 --> 18:43.706

18:43.840 --> 18:46.252
I mean, you saw her
last night, obviously

18:46.327 --> 18:49.276
but in the last few hours or so?

18:49.385 --> 18:51.424
Yeah, not since this morning.

18:51.674 --> 18:54.987
That's great, by the way,
the whole you and Cassie thing.

18:55.096 --> 18:56.511
It's just great.

18:56.573 --> 19:00.729
Hey, if she reaches
out to you in any way

19:00.815 --> 19:03.534
can you just let her know
that we're pretty worried

19:03.612 --> 19:06.448
and she should call or text us.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.370
Okay, mom.

19:22.053 --> 19:23.349
Anybody home?

19:24.748 --> 19:25.918
Hey.

19:37.607 --> 19:40.599
Ooh. I guess this is, uh,
a bad time to tell you

19:40.645 --> 19:42.240
I'm trying to go gluten free.

19:44.870 --> 19:47.460
So I ran into Paige
on set today.

19:47.794 --> 19:49.818
I really think
you should text her.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.435
Hey, what is it?

19:54.715 --> 19:58.052
If you knew, you might
not like me anymore.

19:58.106 --> 20:00.834
I've been around. Try me.

20:03.566 --> 20:05.388
Well, my private loan
fell through

20:05.449 --> 20:09.099
and I've fallen behind
on my CMU tuition payments.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.766

20:15.306 --> 20:16.748

20:18.003 --> 20:20.490
Well, a hooker
would've been bad.

20:21.657 --> 20:25.068
But topless maid, who cares?

20:25.232 --> 20:27.849
You use organic
cleaning supplies, right?

20:29.722 --> 20:31.466

20:33.168 --> 20:35.568
I had a job this morning..

20:35.963 --> 20:38.357
And it was kind of a party..

20:40.721 --> 20:42.552

we wanna clear up
any misunderstanding

21:34.903 --> 21:38.276
regarding the Time Sorceress
character in "Locked".

21:38.352 --> 21:40.526
The Time Sorceress
is not a ghost.

21:40.687 --> 21:42.135
Or a spirit.

21:48.158 --> 21:50.128
The Sorceress
moves around in time

21:50.542 --> 21:52.534
like "The Terminator".

21:54.922 --> 21:57.315
Just like "The Terminator."

21:57.613 --> 21:59.190
- Schwarzenegger?
- Yes.

21:59.266 --> 22:00.768
But you see, "The Terminator"

22:00.905 --> 22:03.862
was not set
in a specific time period.

22:04.070 --> 22:06.440
Since "Locked" is in present day

22:06.675 --> 22:09.065

is inauspicious'

22:09.134 --> 22:10.377

22:13.556 --> 22:16.354
'The only way we can distribute
"Locked" in China'

22:16.457 --> 22:18.797
is if you cast a Chinese actress

22:18.976 --> 22:21.377
in the role of Time Sorceress.

22:21.479 --> 22:24.859

already playing that role.

22:29.591 --> 22:33.213

shot half those scenes.

What if you had a full-time job

37:45.934 --> 37:48.846
but you could still go
to all your classes

37:48.905 --> 37:50.618
and study whenever you want?

37:50.659 --> 37:53.465
Well, that's amazing,
but not possible.

37:53.546 --> 37:56.370
Well, I just found out that
I get an assistant on the movie

37:56.441 --> 37:58.363
and I don't even really need one

37:58.410 --> 38:01.335
so you could just do it
in between classes.

38:01.438 --> 38:03.094
I-I'd be your assistant?

38:03.140 --> 38:04.304
Yeah, it's gonna be so cool.

38:04.336 --> 38:06.524
You'd literally be
getting just paid to, like

38:06.600 --> 38:08.193
hang out with me on set.

38:08.277 --> 38:11.882
Oh, my goodness.
This is such a good idea.

38:11.897 --> 38:16.859
Okay, let's do it. Ebrate?
I could crush some tacos. Gos?

38:19.589 --> 38:21.771
Umm, it's Rainer.

38:22.061 --> 38:23.941
I.. It's probably about Vegas.

38:24.025 --> 38:25.471
Uh, okay, what did I miss?

38:25.506 --> 38:28.436
We were gonna go to Vegas
with Rainer in his private jet

38:28.455 --> 38:30.368
and stay in the penthouse
of the Bellagio

38:30.441 --> 38:32.723
but, yeah.

38:32.783 --> 38:35.274
Uh, give me second.
I'm gonna take this.

38:35.349 --> 38:37.667
Hey! Rainer.

38:37.730 --> 38:39.542
'Hey, so did you find Cas?'

38:39.560 --> 38:41.281
'You girls at the airport?
I just landed.'

38:41.296 --> 38:42.743
Uh...

38:42.817 --> 38:45.102
Uh, yeah, she-she just came home

38:45.188 --> 38:48.575
but we can't go
to Vegas with you.

38:48.762 --> 38:51.463
Umm, we really just need
to be home right now.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.148
'But I already
bought your tickets'

38:53.234 --> 38:55.627
'and I'm here in Vegas
waiting for you.'

38:57.459 --> 39:00.089
I'm-I'm really sorry, Rainer.
I gotta go.

39:12.497 --> 39:14.723
'Thanks for the ride, man.'

39:14.818 --> 39:17.596
Needed a pick-me-up
after being ditched in Vegas.

39:18.837 --> 39:19.987
Holy..

39:21.707 --> 39:23.045
'What the hell.'

39:25.139 --> 39:26.597
We've been robbed.

39:35.008 --> 39:36.949
Son of a bitch.
