WEBVTT

00:01.267 --> 00:02.307
Previously on "Shut Eye"...

00:02.308 --> 00:03.628
I'm here to keep you honest.

00:03.629 --> 00:06.101
Are you gonna build someone better?

00:06.128 --> 00:08.048
I am.
Make me believe.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.571
I'm gonna build someone better!

00:09.572 --> 00:11.453
That's what I want to hear!

00:12.935 --> 00:14.616
You're right to be angry with me.

00:14.617 --> 00:17.779
Was last night a
tune-up for the machine?

00:17.780 --> 00:19.060
Yours and mine.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.462
I don't want to hurt my wife.

00:20.463 --> 00:22.343
The receiver...

00:22.344 --> 00:23.705
and the microphone.

00:23.706 --> 00:26.067
So all you need to do is talk into it

00:26.068 --> 00:28.269
right before you go out and mingle.

00:28.270 --> 00:29.390
You next?

00:31.353 --> 00:32.594
Cowboy, cowb...

00:32.595 --> 00:33.715
It's a Western.
Yes.

00:35.237 --> 00:37.358
She's cool.
She is.

00:37.359 --> 00:38.897
Good night.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.843
So when's Dad coming back?

00:41.844 --> 00:43.605
I don't know.

00:45.407 --> 00:47.088
Who you texting with?

00:47.089 --> 00:49.290
Pretty sure you need a warrant
for info like that.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.573
Simza and I are aware

00:51.574 --> 00:54.295
of your appeals to rejoin the family.

00:54.296 --> 00:57.819
I'll reach out to Josip
and make a formal request.

00:59.261 --> 01:00.582
I need a solid earner

01:00.583 --> 01:03.104
to get my corporation back on track.

01:03.105 --> 01:06.227
And I have a house full of kids
who need a father.

01:06.228 --> 01:10.472
There is someone who fits both fuckin'
bills.

01:10.473 --> 01:12.113
This is pretty unusual.

01:13.876 --> 01:15.478
Fuckin' A, Big Jim.

01:21.684 --> 01:23.364
Come and get this.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.141 --> 01:42.544
No, no. Wait. Wait. Wait.
The key is only flip 'em once.

01:42.545 --> 01:44.586
Otherwise, they go dry.

01:44.587 --> 01:45.707
Okay.

02:00.242 --> 02:03.525
Dad!
Hey, baby!

02:03.526 --> 02:05.607
Hey, you want cheese on yours?

02:05.608 --> 02:08.089
Yeah. And no pink.
No pink?

02:08.090 --> 02:10.452
What have these Rankos been
teaching you, huh?

02:10.453 --> 02:12.133
I don't want to know
if it was once an animal.

02:12.134 --> 02:13.735
Hey, animals eat animals.

02:13.736 --> 02:15.256
It's the circle of life.

02:15.257 --> 02:16.618
Survival of the fittest.

02:16.619 --> 02:17.979
Hakuna Matata.

02:17.980 --> 02:20.261
Only the strongest survive, LaLa

02:20.262 --> 02:21.302
Dad!

03:02.825 --> 03:04.706
Thanks.

03:04.707 --> 03:07.268
Hey, sorry, Ma.

03:07.269 --> 03:10.192
Cannonball!
Aaah!

03:23.766 --> 03:25.887
Still writing poetry?

03:25.888 --> 03:26.982
Dad...

03:27.690 --> 03:29.276
Hey, uh...

03:29.972 --> 03:32.454
Simza knows you've been
texting other boys.

03:32.455 --> 03:34.976
I'm not texting other boys.
It's just Nick.

03:34.977 --> 03:36.458
Nick Haverford?

03:36.459 --> 03:38.179
We go to the same school now.

03:38.577 --> 03:39.861
Listen, honey.

03:39.862 --> 03:42.824
We got to be on our best
behavior for a while.

03:42.825 --> 03:45.947
I'm not doing anything wrong.
We're just friends.

03:45.948 --> 03:47.308
But you're married.

03:47.309 --> 03:49.310
Tony moved back into his old room.

03:49.311 --> 03:51.593
And I'm staying in LaLa's.

03:51.594 --> 03:53.755
We're not... together.

04:04.406 --> 04:06.488
The Council is watching us.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.169
Okay?

04:08.170 --> 04:10.359
Waiting for us to screw up.

04:11.494 --> 04:13.455
Which means you need to cool it
with your new "friend"

04:13.456 --> 04:15.096
until things settle down.

04:15.097 --> 04:17.418
We got to play nice.

04:17.418 --> 04:19.201
Understand?

04:20.423 --> 04:22.665
That's my girl. Love ya, baby.

04:32.034 --> 04:34.315
Who would have thought...
Mm-hmm.

04:34.316 --> 04:37.238
a few months ago that we'd be here?

04:40.122 --> 04:42.083
What is this?

04:42.084 --> 04:44.646
The Council asked for a status report

04:44.647 --> 04:46.528
on White T's assets.

04:46.529 --> 04:48.289
Huh.
Mm-hmm.

04:48.290 --> 04:50.190
And what is the status?

04:50.733 --> 04:51.933
Who the fuck knows.

04:51.934 --> 04:53.455
They're testing me.

04:53.456 --> 04:55.577
I can't make heads or
tails of this shit.

04:58.140 --> 05:00.101
All right, everybody! Out of the pool!

05:00.102 --> 05:03.144
Time to eat! Go Rankos!

05:03.145 --> 05:04.913
Fonso.

05:05.708 --> 05:09.511
Can you make sense of any of this?

05:09.512 --> 05:11.336
Uh...

05:12.234 --> 05:15.717
These are wire transfers
to shadow companies.

05:15.718 --> 05:18.969
White Tony had his fingers
in a lot of pies.

05:19.602 --> 05:21.282
What is it?
Huh?

05:23.390 --> 05:26.247
You know, we should have lunch.
This can wait.

05:26.248 --> 05:29.050
It's the first meal we have with
the family after a long time.

05:29.051 --> 05:30.331
Come on.

05:30.332 --> 05:31.813
You get out of the pool.

05:31.814 --> 05:33.456
Come on.

05:42.184 --> 05:43.304
Hey.

05:43.305 --> 05:46.548
I, um... wanted to say thank you

05:46.549 --> 05:48.790
for uh... you know,

05:48.791 --> 05:50.872
doing right by my girls,
being there for them.

05:50.873 --> 05:52.634
It means a lot.

05:52.635 --> 05:55.356
Well,
there's something I haven't told you.

05:55.357 --> 05:56.882
What is it?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.081
You look good.

06:39.722 --> 06:41.468
Entre

06:43.486 --> 06:45.013
Ma?

06:46.048 --> 06:47.557
Um...

06:48.350 --> 06:50.132
Expecting someone.

06:56.274 --> 06:57.619
What is it?

06:57.620 --> 06:59.541
There is something we need to discuss.

06:59.542 --> 07:02.223
What? That I'm a piece of shit?

07:02.224 --> 07:03.705
That I fucked up?

07:03.706 --> 07:05.200
I fucked up.

07:06.243 --> 07:07.749
I was backed in a corner...

07:07.750 --> 07:09.511
a corner of your making, I should say...

07:09.512 --> 07:11.593
what you've done to me,
what you've done to White Tony.

07:11.594 --> 07:13.375
What are you talking about?

07:14.076 --> 07:16.117
I told them about you.

07:16.378 --> 07:17.879
Told who?

07:18.046 --> 07:19.801
The FBI.

07:19.802 --> 07:21.763
They have been building a RICO case

07:21.764 --> 07:24.126
against the families for years.

07:28.098 --> 07:29.891
What did you promise them?

07:30.292 --> 07:32.352
I promised them you.

07:34.577 --> 07:36.377
But now you're back in the family,

07:36.378 --> 07:38.259
and I see you with the girls.

07:38.260 --> 07:41.182
I can't do this.
I can't go through with this.

07:47.069 --> 07:48.950
But I was given no choice.

07:48.951 --> 07:50.752
You really hate me that much?

07:50.753 --> 07:53.039
You do this to your own son...

07:53.676 --> 07:55.437
to your own family?

07:55.438 --> 07:58.840
I was trying to protect my family.

07:58.841 --> 08:01.506
By handing me over to the Feds?

08:07.089 --> 08:09.306
You've protected no one.

08:09.812 --> 08:13.135
And you've destroyed everything.

08:17.940 --> 08:19.441
Fuck!

09:15.037 --> 09:18.880
It was my understanding that
his name is Gordon.

09:18.881 --> 09:21.963
Yes, his name was Gordon,
but he went by "Gord."

09:21.964 --> 09:24.205
Not everyone uses their legal name.

09:24.206 --> 09:26.287
We need a way of narrowing it down.

09:26.288 --> 09:28.850
I don't know what you are
complaining about.

09:28.851 --> 09:30.211
I thought you were great tonight.

09:30.212 --> 09:32.213
What's this?
Oh, great.

09:32.214 --> 09:34.937
Just in time. Open it!

09:41.183 --> 09:42.864
How did you find this?

09:42.865 --> 09:44.506
It took a lot of digging.

09:44.507 --> 09:46.147
I Googled "creepy-ass doll,"

09:46.148 --> 09:48.349
and this was the first thing
that came up.

09:48.350 --> 09:50.391
"Murphy"...
I didn't know that was his name,

09:50.392 --> 09:52.193
let alone he was a man of mystery.

09:52.194 --> 09:54.195
He certainly lived up to his hype.

09:54.196 --> 09:56.518
It sounded like he was important to you.

09:56.519 --> 10:00.201
Linda would say that
you're feeding my delusion.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.804
I'm feeding your curiosity,

10:02.805 --> 10:05.847
which is something you cannot
have enough of in this business.

10:05.848 --> 10:07.729
Besides, you've worked hard.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.691
I thought you deserved
a little something

10:09.692 --> 10:11.136
in recognition.

10:12.137 --> 10:13.815
I really appreciate it.

10:13.816 --> 10:16.097
This... This is...

10:16.098 --> 10:18.017
This is great.

10:18.981 --> 10:20.520
Good night, Charlie.

10:22.264 --> 10:24.385
Keep him tucked away somewhere safe.

10:24.386 --> 10:28.991
We do not want him suffering
the same fate as the last one.

10:33.155 --> 10:36.679
Murphy, man of mystery.

10:39.001 --> 10:40.790
Careful with that.

10:42.083 --> 10:44.006
Do you mind taping these up?

10:51.934 --> 10:53.575
Thanks.

10:53.576 --> 10:54.736
Hey, stranger.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.137
Are we moving out?

10:56.138 --> 10:57.939
Or is someone moving in?

10:57.940 --> 10:59.781
Cleaning out the parlor.

10:59.782 --> 11:00.982
You're away more than you're here,

11:00.983 --> 11:02.584
and I can't run two shops,

11:02.585 --> 11:04.666
so I figured I'd turn this
into a proper guest room.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.988
Hosting parties
and reorganizing the house...

11:06.989 --> 11:09.030
You're turning into a regular
Martha Stewart.

11:09.031 --> 11:10.992
"Build someone better", right?

11:10.993 --> 11:12.033
Ah.

11:12.034 --> 11:13.823
I see what you did there.

11:15.598 --> 11:16.638
You okay?

11:16.639 --> 11:17.919
Yeah, I'm just tired.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.360
Hey!

11:19.361 --> 11:21.843
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna throw it away.

11:21.844 --> 11:23.685
Most of it's going to the other shop.

11:23.686 --> 11:25.585
The rest we put in storage.

11:26.669 --> 11:27.969
You know what?

11:27.970 --> 11:31.212
Come to think of it,
we can toss most of this stuff.

11:31.213 --> 11:33.259
That's very evolved of you.

11:33.976 --> 11:36.258
I guess Maggie's a good
influence after all.

11:45.468 --> 11:47.869
How was Vancouver?
Good.

11:47.870 --> 11:49.190
People are really nice.

11:49.191 --> 11:51.232
They apologize for absolutely no reason.

11:51.233 --> 11:54.035
I think it's their national past time.

11:54.036 --> 11:55.824
So where's my souvenir?

11:56.519 --> 11:58.480
Not even a shirt with a moose on it.

11:58.481 --> 12:00.201
Sorry. I'll make it up to you.

12:00.202 --> 12:01.843
Hey, where's Nick?

12:01.844 --> 12:03.765
In his room. Pouting.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.246
Did you take away his phone
or his PlayStation?

12:05.247 --> 12:06.488
His phone.

12:06.489 --> 12:07.929
He's on that thing day and night.

12:07.930 --> 12:09.330
Thought you were gonna have
a chat with him.

12:09.331 --> 12:11.172
Is he still texting Drina?
Mm.

12:11.173 --> 12:13.935
What do you think is going on?
All signs point to a crush.

12:13.936 --> 12:15.336
Fantastic.

12:15.337 --> 12:16.578
And what's he to her?

12:16.579 --> 12:18.179
A distraction.

12:18.180 --> 12:19.781
We just got out from under
the thumb of that family.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.863
We can't fuck that up.

12:21.864 --> 12:23.024
This has to stop.

12:23.025 --> 12:24.827
I'll talk to him.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.676
How do you guys not have
high blood pressure?

12:34.677 --> 12:37.156
80% of our diet is sodium.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.682
We'll cook dinner for
you tomorrow night.

12:40.683 --> 12:43.204
Your mom and I have been
really busy with work lately,

12:43.205 --> 12:45.527
which in the long run,
is actually good for you.

12:45.528 --> 12:47.288
Not if I die first.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.571
Maybe I'll go vegan for a while.

12:49.572 --> 12:51.252
Since when do you eat vegetables?

12:51.253 --> 12:52.854
Red meat is bad for you.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.216
It increases cholesterol
and increases inflammation.

12:55.217 --> 12:57.218
And just wreaks havoc

12:57.219 --> 12:59.901
on those little micro...

12:59.902 --> 13:01.142
for your gut.

13:01.143 --> 13:02.584
Where'd you hear that?

13:05.508 --> 13:07.068
A health seminar at school.

13:07.854 --> 13:08.750
Listen, buddy.

13:08.751 --> 13:10.391
We need to talk about your texting.

13:10.392 --> 13:12.033
Come on, Dad. Not you, too.

13:12.034 --> 13:13.394
You need to knock it off.

13:13.395 --> 13:15.356
And whatever this
thing you have going on

13:15.357 --> 13:16.357
with Fonso's daughter...

13:16.358 --> 13:18.440
Look, th-there's no thing.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.121
Okay?

13:20.122 --> 13:21.322
I just feel bad for her.

13:21.323 --> 13:22.619
That's all.

13:26.208 --> 13:27.624
Go ahead.

13:28.731 --> 13:30.251
I'm gonna be right back.

13:30.252 --> 13:32.013
Yeah, what's up?

13:32.014 --> 13:33.815
How is that fair?

13:34.130 --> 13:35.216
You pay the mortgage,

13:35.217 --> 13:37.579
then you can be the
judge of what's fair.

13:37.580 --> 13:39.260
I helped you out at the shop.

13:39.261 --> 13:41.382
Yes, you did, and I appreciate that,

13:41.383 --> 13:43.625
but that doesn't make you
an equal partner around here.

13:43.626 --> 13:44.986
Come on, Mom.
Right now?

13:44.987 --> 13:46.267
My phone...

13:46.268 --> 13:47.989
I promise I won't do anything stupid.

13:47.990 --> 13:49.871
Okay? Please.

13:54.156 --> 13:56.197
Famous last words.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.281
You are not going to believe this.

14:00.282 --> 14:01.763
You're staying for dinner?

14:01.764 --> 14:04.245
Some big tech company in Silicon Valley

14:04.246 --> 14:06.968
is having their annual retreat
next month.

14:06.969 --> 14:08.249
Thank you.
And Maggie thinks

14:08.250 --> 14:09.931
that's a tremendous opportunity.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.814
And the CEO wants to hear our pitch

14:12.815 --> 14:14.837
first thing tomorrow morning.

14:15.297 --> 14:16.965
Tomorrow morning.

14:18.220 --> 14:20.381
You haven't even unpacked.
I know.

14:20.382 --> 14:24.305
Flight's tonight at 9:00.

14:24.306 --> 14:27.308
You know, I'm gonna pass.

14:27.309 --> 14:29.270
I'll just pass.

14:29.271 --> 14:30.770
No.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.394
You can't.

14:38.653 --> 14:41.042
Uh, at least you got it back.

14:41.043 --> 14:42.884
Yeah, after two days.

14:42.885 --> 14:44.686
Parents suck.

14:44.687 --> 14:46.160
Tell me about it.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.010
What's it like having your dad back?

14:49.747 --> 14:50.852
Weird.

14:50.853 --> 14:52.293
You're not gonna believe this,

14:52.294 --> 14:55.096
but I swear I saw him
and Simza flirting.

14:55.097 --> 14:56.417
What?

14:56.418 --> 14:58.379
No way.

14:58.380 --> 14:59.861
Isn't that, like, illegal or something?

14:59.862 --> 15:02.664
Yeah. Maybe.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.588
I don't... I don't know.

15:07.765 --> 15:09.726
What? What's wrong?

15:12.314 --> 15:14.315
We have to break up.

15:14.316 --> 15:16.518
Fake... break up. You know what I mean.

15:16.519 --> 15:18.079
We can't hang out anymore.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.761
Why?

15:19.762 --> 15:21.002
Did something happen?

15:21.003 --> 15:23.990
Tony saw some of our messages.

15:24.406 --> 15:25.767
Guess he kind of lost it.

15:25.768 --> 15:27.529
Oh, shit.

15:27.530 --> 15:29.611
Yeah, and now my dad is here,

15:29.612 --> 15:32.134
looking over my shoulder
every two seconds.

15:34.751 --> 15:36.538
This sucks.

15:36.539 --> 15:38.179
You're, like, the only friend I have.

15:38.180 --> 15:40.214
Yeah. Same.

15:41.883 --> 15:43.509
I mean, you're mine.

15:44.306 --> 15:46.588
My friend. I...

15:46.589 --> 15:48.790
I wouldn't be friends with myself.

15:48.791 --> 15:51.433
Gosh, you're so dumb.

15:54.196 --> 15:55.877
Drina, let me in!

15:55.878 --> 15:58.040
It's my room, too!

16:01.027 --> 16:03.084
I-I got to go.

16:03.085 --> 16:05.567
Okay, I'll see you around.
Yeah. Okay.

16:05.568 --> 16:07.700
Okay. bye.
Bye.

16:24.146 --> 16:27.389
Sorry about this.
I was hoping to stay a while.

16:31.594 --> 16:33.142
You all right?

16:35.918 --> 16:37.438
What'd you call it?

16:38.961 --> 16:40.522
An itch?

16:40.523 --> 16:42.805
The thing I had with Gina.

16:46.769 --> 16:48.658
Is that all it is...

16:49.492 --> 16:51.173
you and Maggie?

16:53.736 --> 16:55.623
You scratching an itch?

16:57.379 --> 16:58.620
I mean, I get it.

16:58.621 --> 17:01.943
She's... a beautiful woman.

17:01.944 --> 17:03.756
Smart as fuck.

17:05.468 --> 17:07.343
Gone out of her way to help you.

17:08.150 --> 17:09.751
To help us.

17:16.638 --> 17:19.981
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing that you told me.

17:21.684 --> 17:24.046
Don't get emotionally involved.

17:30.292 --> 17:32.577
You don't want to miss your flight.

18:09.371 --> 18:11.454
You're like a hermit up in here.

18:14.777 --> 18:16.287
What are you up to?

18:18.861 --> 18:20.583
Unpacking.

18:21.864 --> 18:24.186
Well, you fuckin' suck at it.

18:28.711 --> 18:31.032
You know, you surprise me, Fonso.

18:31.033 --> 18:34.676
You've been here for days now,
and you have yet to do anything,

18:34.677 --> 18:36.015
um...

18:37.225 --> 18:38.600
indecent.

18:40.282 --> 18:42.164
I'm here for my girls.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.493
Just...

18:51.494 --> 18:52.935
for your girls?

18:59.261 --> 19:00.503
What's wrong?

19:03.826 --> 19:05.146
Our kids are married.

19:05.147 --> 19:07.380
Like you give a shit about that.

19:09.672 --> 19:11.713
Maybe you were right.

19:12.134 --> 19:14.387
What you said to me at the cemetery.

19:15.157 --> 19:16.973
What? About us?

19:19.361 --> 19:22.084
Everywhere I go, people get hurt.

19:25.848 --> 19:28.129
My family deserves better.

19:28.130 --> 19:29.812
You deserve better.

19:33.456 --> 19:35.574
Where the hell is this coming from?

19:36.539 --> 19:37.785
Hmm?

19:38.420 --> 19:40.788
We should stay away from each other.

19:41.864 --> 19:43.916
It's best for everybody.

19:51.434 --> 19:53.475
Pick a card. Any card.

19:53.476 --> 19:56.037
Oh, I don't think
I'm the right person for this.

19:56.038 --> 19:57.839
The last time I
decorated anything myself

19:57.840 --> 19:59.721
it was the Christmas tree
in my dorm room.

19:59.722 --> 20:02.893
Come on.

20:03.686 --> 20:06.007
Oh, before I forget.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.850
I figured after your scare,

20:08.851 --> 20:10.972
you could use something
to calm the nerves.

20:10.973 --> 20:15.656
So blue agate represents
serenity and healing.

20:16.741 --> 20:18.900
Thank you.

20:18.901 --> 20:21.783
I prefer bourbon, myself.
Me, too.

20:21.784 --> 20:23.785
But, hopefully, this will tide me over.

20:23.786 --> 20:25.207
Hm.

20:26.068 --> 20:27.469
So where do I put this?

20:27.470 --> 20:28.910
Above your bed.

20:28.911 --> 20:32.034
The energy will wash over you
while you sleep.

20:34.757 --> 20:37.219
You know,
this might be a good color for the room.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.601
Huh.

20:39.602 --> 20:42.516
I was looking at the blues.

20:43.405 --> 20:46.007
But I think red could be fun, too.

20:46.008 --> 20:47.809
Hm. Well,
whatever you do with this room,

20:47.810 --> 20:49.410
you should put a crib in the corner

20:49.411 --> 20:52.173
so I can drop the baby off
when I need to sleep.

20:52.174 --> 20:54.616
I kind of miss having
a little one around.

20:55.898 --> 20:57.579
At least you know what to do with one.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.221
I am flying completely blind here.

21:00.222 --> 21:03.064
I mean... Paz is a great friend but...

21:03.065 --> 21:05.106
He doesn't know what he's doing.

21:07.630 --> 21:10.952
There's just only so much
I feel I can ask of him.

21:10.953 --> 21:12.273
Well, during my pregnancy,

21:12.274 --> 21:14.275
Charlie was working all the time.

21:15.508 --> 21:16.357
It was hard.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.135
I felt so alone.

21:19.121 --> 21:21.002
I used to think that
I'd be better off like that...

21:21.003 --> 21:22.283
by myself.

21:22.284 --> 21:23.645
But now I just think that's something

21:23.646 --> 21:25.366
lonely people tell themselves.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.889
You know, honestly, I have no idea

21:27.890 --> 21:29.811
how I'm gonna get through this.

21:33.856 --> 21:34.817
Orange marmalade.

21:34.818 --> 21:36.297
No. Nope.

21:36.298 --> 21:37.659
No.

21:41.664 --> 21:44.105
There's a new trend of companies here

21:44.106 --> 21:46.027
bringing in external consultants

21:46.028 --> 21:48.510
to work with our clients
and our team members.

21:48.511 --> 21:50.392
We're excited to have you here.

21:55.317 --> 21:57.879
The proposal that I sent over earlier

21:57.880 --> 22:00.762
offers a more detailed look
at our strategy

22:00.763 --> 22:02.844
for changing the
culture in your company.

22:02.845 --> 22:05.166
Suffice to say,
it is designed to be malleable

22:05.167 --> 22:06.448
depending on your needs.

22:06.449 --> 22:08.289
It is an approach that has proved

22:08.290 --> 22:09.891
very successful elsewhere.

22:09.892 --> 22:14.536
And we are confident that
it will work well here, as well.

22:14.537 --> 22:15.977
Yeah. That's right.

22:15.978 --> 22:18.339
Um, and we can adapt

22:18.340 --> 22:19.905
to whatever you need.

22:24.266 --> 22:26.669
So these are the objects
you've brought in.

22:39.722 --> 22:41.322
That obvious?

22:41.323 --> 22:44.005
I don't need special powers
to ID a mama's boy.

22:45.888 --> 22:48.930
I'm surprised and touched
you'd even let me hold this.

22:48.931 --> 22:52.495
I doubt it's even left its case
very much.

22:58.541 --> 23:01.102
The MLB logo makes it a game ball.

23:01.103 --> 23:03.224
There's a scuff,
but there's no signature.

23:03.225 --> 23:04.946
Was it a foul ball?

23:04.947 --> 23:06.227
Yes, it was.

23:06.228 --> 23:08.309
But you weren't even at the game.

23:08.310 --> 23:09.751
No.
That's too bad.

23:09.752 --> 23:11.072
It was a good one, I heard.

23:11.073 --> 23:13.114
Perfect games are rare.

23:13.115 --> 23:15.797
Only one by a Giants pitcher.

23:15.798 --> 23:17.318
Holy shit.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.160
Is that right?

23:19.161 --> 23:22.134
Matt Cain, back in 2012.

23:23.766 --> 23:25.927
Now you...
Oh!

23:25.928 --> 23:27.729
We don't need to give
away all our goods.

23:27.730 --> 23:30.331
Always leave them wanting more, right?

23:30.332 --> 23:31.693
Oh, come on.

23:31.694 --> 23:33.094
I bet his colleagues would love to hear

23:33.095 --> 23:35.617
about his ex-girlfriend.

23:36.690 --> 23:38.339
You're no longer together, are you?

23:39.735 --> 23:41.262
No.

23:41.263 --> 23:43.705
But you kept this as a remembrance.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.467
She left that at my place.

23:45.468 --> 23:47.117
She broke it off.

23:48.577 --> 23:49.751
You miss her.

23:50.913 --> 23:53.034
But you're gonna win her back.

23:53.035 --> 23:54.916
She, uh...

23:54.917 --> 23:56.798
She passed away.

23:56.799 --> 23:58.504
About a year ago.

24:04.447 --> 24:06.928
I-I'm sorry. Uh...

24:06.929 --> 24:09.211
I'm sorry.

24:17.460 --> 24:19.300
What the hell was that?
What do you expect?

24:19.301 --> 24:21.583
I'm not used to this...
all these quick turnarounds.

24:21.584 --> 24:23.945
I'm exhausted.
Don't give me that shit.

24:23.946 --> 24:25.467
We had the research.

24:25.468 --> 24:27.669
You're the one that
went off-book in there.

24:27.670 --> 24:30.391
Don't sabotage this, Charlie.
I'm not sabotaging it.

24:30.392 --> 24:32.914
Word gets around like wildfire
in companies like this.

24:32.915 --> 24:34.836
As difficult as it was for me
to get us in there today,

24:34.837 --> 24:36.397
it will be twice as hard tomorrow.

24:36.398 --> 24:37.839
I get it. I get it.

24:38.460 --> 24:40.882
We are on the precipice
of something here.

24:40.883 --> 24:42.764
I know you can feel that.

24:42.765 --> 24:44.606
You're just scared.

24:44.607 --> 24:46.427
They don't need someone like me.

24:47.770 --> 24:50.452
Maybe they're better off
with someone like Paz.

24:50.453 --> 24:52.454
Maybe... Maybe you're better off.

24:52.455 --> 24:54.055
Oh, for fuck's sake.

24:54.056 --> 24:56.137
Is it so hard for you to drop this shit,

24:56.138 --> 24:57.338
just for an hour?

24:57.339 --> 24:59.340
Your wife, your family.

24:59.341 --> 25:01.734
You don't think I have someone?

25:02.745 --> 25:05.226
It's fucking hard, but I bury it.

25:05.227 --> 25:07.148
I put it to one side
for the sake of the work,

25:07.149 --> 25:10.072
for the sake of what we are
trying to achieve.

25:12.314 --> 25:14.115
Take an earlier flight back.

25:14.116 --> 25:17.599
I still have business up here
and a retreat this weekend.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.922
Go home to your family, Charlie.

25:42.865 --> 25:45.827
Mm.

25:45.828 --> 25:48.781
I thought you were gonna
be in here all night.

25:49.351 --> 25:51.192
You know me.

25:51.193 --> 25:54.957
I always do my worst thinking
in the shower.

25:56.238 --> 25:58.560
I've been doing some thinking of my own.

25:58.561 --> 26:00.482
Oh.

26:00.483 --> 26:02.323
Let's get away this weekend.

26:02.324 --> 26:04.566
Monterey, Carmel...

26:04.567 --> 26:07.969
Take pictures of the sea lions.

26:07.970 --> 26:10.803
Get drunk on local wine.

26:11.974 --> 26:14.896
Sounds amazing.

26:14.897 --> 26:17.178
But I can't just pick up and leave town.

26:17.179 --> 26:19.260
Tell him it's a reunion.

26:19.261 --> 26:21.823
Your old friends from the Club.

26:21.824 --> 26:24.547
He knows I don't talk
to those girls anymore.

26:27.029 --> 26:28.911
Next weekend?

26:32.394 --> 26:33.701
I can't.

26:35.998 --> 26:37.746
Will you ever?

26:38.320 --> 26:40.001
I have responsibilities.

26:40.002 --> 26:43.085
What about your responsibility to me?

26:43.686 --> 26:46.809
And this thing that you started.

26:47.930 --> 26:49.571
It isn't just some infatuation.

26:49.572 --> 26:51.218
It's more than that.

26:52.455 --> 26:54.577
I don't know what it is.

26:56.939 --> 26:59.020
But if you're asking me
to leave my family...

26:59.021 --> 27:01.944
He doesn't make you happy.

27:03.866 --> 27:05.547
He's my partner.

27:05.548 --> 27:07.276
I'm your lover.

27:08.911 --> 27:11.873
You got to figure out
what means more to you.

27:11.874 --> 27:14.074
You can't have it both ways.

27:15.638 --> 27:17.759
Maybe that's the problem.

27:17.760 --> 27:19.841
Maybe I want both.

28:00.282 --> 28:01.763
Hi.

28:01.764 --> 28:03.925
This is my son, Kevin.

28:03.926 --> 28:06.007
First time.

28:06.008 --> 28:07.689
Very excited to be here.

28:07.690 --> 28:09.296
Where's my dad?

28:09.972 --> 28:11.632
He's not with you?

28:13.135 --> 28:15.417
We just got here ourselves.

28:25.548 --> 28:27.314
What's the matter with you?

28:29.552 --> 28:32.714
Ahh. Nothing.
Something happened.

28:32.715 --> 28:34.075
Tell me, maybe I can help you.

28:34.076 --> 28:36.657
There's no point. Everything's fucked.

28:39.442 --> 28:41.723
"Men are like steel.

28:41.724 --> 28:45.487
When they lose their temper,
they lose their worth."

28:45.488 --> 28:46.768
Bruce Lee.

28:46.769 --> 28:48.129
Chuck Norris.

28:48.130 --> 28:50.092
Come on. Talk to me.

28:52.935 --> 28:56.257
I dropped my guard for one second.

28:56.258 --> 28:58.540
Allowed myself to be happy,

28:58.541 --> 29:02.303
and the universe just clobbered me.

29:02.304 --> 29:04.065
Give me that.

29:04.066 --> 29:06.428
Now, you listen to me.

29:06.429 --> 29:08.750
We got a good thing going here.

29:08.751 --> 29:10.983
I can't have you losing your shit.

29:12.234 --> 29:14.155
Now, I don't know what's going on,

29:14.156 --> 29:15.917
but you better get it together.

29:15.918 --> 29:17.479
Pbthh.

29:17.480 --> 29:19.200
This is what's gonna happen.

29:19.201 --> 29:21.963
You're gonna go home,
and you're gonna take a shower.

29:21.964 --> 29:23.445
You're gonna put on some new clothes,

29:23.446 --> 29:26.207
and you're gonna man the fuck up.

29:28.090 --> 29:31.694
Come on.

29:36.098 --> 29:37.419
There you go.

29:41.096 --> 29:42.544
Thank you.

29:42.545 --> 29:43.745
Okay.

29:44.867 --> 29:46.748
Oww!

29:46.749 --> 29:49.110
The fuck was that?

29:49.111 --> 29:50.552
Break it up. It's okay.
Ow!

29:50.553 --> 29:51.873
Break it up. It's okay.
Everybody be calm.

29:51.874 --> 29:53.795
It's not my fault he fell for it.

29:53.796 --> 29:55.437
What happened?
She cheated!

29:55.438 --> 29:57.519
I didn't cheat! I feinted.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.601
He thought I was gonna go high,
but I went low.

29:59.602 --> 30:01.042
She kicked him in the nuts.

30:01.043 --> 30:02.444
I wonder where she got that from.

30:02.445 --> 30:05.326
All right, Mateo, shake it off.

30:05.327 --> 30:07.208
We were learning about fighting styles.

30:07.209 --> 30:08.930
I'm an offensive fighter.

30:08.931 --> 30:10.972
I trick them before they can trick me.

30:10.973 --> 30:13.575
It's called bathing.

30:13.576 --> 30:16.017
Honey,
I think you mean the word "baiting."

30:16.018 --> 30:17.258
Yeah.

30:21.544 --> 30:22.824
Hey.

30:22.825 --> 30:24.906
I ever tell you you're a genius?

30:24.907 --> 30:26.516
All the time.

30:26.989 --> 30:28.560
Excellent.

30:29.391 --> 30:32.033
Jun-Bi!

30:37.119 --> 30:38.399
Hey.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.905
You alone?

30:40.362 --> 30:41.443
Hey. Yeah.

30:41.444 --> 30:43.925
My mom's in a reading right now.

30:44.868 --> 30:45.887
What are you doing here?

30:45.888 --> 30:49.010
Just wanted to give you something.

30:59.021 --> 31:00.663
Did you write this?

31:11.514 --> 31:13.194
I'm sorry about Claudette.

31:13.195 --> 31:14.716
You were right.

31:14.717 --> 31:16.878
She wasn't being honest.

31:16.879 --> 31:18.960
Thank you so much.

31:18.961 --> 31:20.201
That was wonderful.

31:20.202 --> 31:22.243
I appreciate you opening my eyes.

31:22.244 --> 31:24.126
And I'll see you next week.

31:28.090 --> 31:29.731
Are you okay, honey?

31:29.732 --> 31:32.454
You look like you have a fever.

31:32.455 --> 31:35.578
I think the AC's broken in here.

31:37.179 --> 31:39.260
I'm gonna go pick up some paint
for the parlor.

31:39.261 --> 31:41.543
Do you mind if Nora comes over
for dinner?

31:41.544 --> 31:43.301
Yeah. Why not.

31:44.747 --> 31:47.509
Why don't you finish this up.
I'll be back in an hour.

32:09.852 --> 32:11.413
Thanks, man.

32:35.918 --> 32:38.159
I've got moves.

32:38.160 --> 32:39.561
Come here.
No!

32:47.329 --> 32:48.890
You've never heard this song?
No.

32:48.891 --> 32:50.692
Then I have failed you as a mother.

32:50.693 --> 32:52.574
That's a pretty low bar you set.

32:55.498 --> 32:58.419
Hey!

32:58.420 --> 33:01.102
Hey, Dad.
Hey!

33:02.745 --> 33:04.666
We thought you weren't gonna
be back until tomorrow.

33:04.667 --> 33:07.068
I decided to come back early.

33:07.069 --> 33:09.070
So you went with yellow.

33:09.071 --> 33:12.313
They say it evokes feelings
of warmth and optimism.

33:12.314 --> 33:13.555
What do you think?

33:13.556 --> 33:15.116
I think it looks great.

33:15.117 --> 33:16.277
Hi, Charlie.

33:16.278 --> 33:17.719
How was your trip to San Francisco?

33:17.720 --> 33:19.689
Foggy and cold.

33:21.484 --> 33:23.565
I'm exhausted, so I'm gonna just

33:23.566 --> 33:26.087
hit the hay a little early tonight,
okay?

33:26.088 --> 33:27.328
Are you sure?

33:27.329 --> 33:29.250
We were about to sit down to dinner.

33:29.251 --> 33:31.535
Yeah, I'm sure.

33:33.295 --> 33:34.375
Nick.

33:34.376 --> 33:36.458
Go get cleaned up.

33:36.459 --> 33:38.860
Okay.
I should go.

33:38.861 --> 33:41.182
No.
Yeah.

33:41.183 --> 33:44.305
I feel like I'm in the way.
Oh, don't be silly.

33:44.306 --> 33:47.388
I'm sure Charlie would rather
just spend time with the family.

33:47.389 --> 33:48.590
It's fine.

33:48.591 --> 33:50.929
II... I'll call you, okay?

33:56.439 --> 33:59.320
Mouth dry. I'm awake.

33:59.321 --> 34:02.524
My heartbeat travels from chest to ears.

34:02.525 --> 34:04.245
Where is she?

34:04.246 --> 34:06.488
That laugh was hers.

34:06.489 --> 34:08.770
That laugh was here.

34:08.771 --> 34:11.252
But I am alone.

34:11.253 --> 34:15.136
Rich colors, soft textures.

34:15.137 --> 34:16.913
Where is she?

34:17.460 --> 34:20.221
I greet my eyes in the reflection,

34:20.222 --> 34:22.984
overwhelmed with dread.

34:22.985 --> 34:24.963
I look for her inside.

34:25.708 --> 34:29.230
My eyes quiver as I force them closed.

34:29.231 --> 34:32.313
Please send me back to our memories.

34:32.313 --> 34:34.795
Back to where I can be with you.

35:03.426 --> 35:04.711
Mm.

35:08.070 --> 35:09.791
Hey, uh, I-it's me.

35:09.792 --> 35:11.953
I know it's super-early,
but can you guys come over?

35:11.954 --> 35:13.678
It's an emergency.

35:15.206 --> 35:16.718
Charlie. Get up.

35:18.360 --> 35:21.122
He came in through
the back gate and woke me up.

35:21.123 --> 35:24.085
He's got a cut on his hand,
but he won't let me get near it.

35:24.086 --> 35:27.328
He's totally out of sorts,
talking to himself.

35:27.329 --> 35:29.771
And he's asking for you.
Me?

35:29.772 --> 35:32.975
Yeah. That's why I called,
because he said he needed you.

35:39.061 --> 35:40.862
Paz. Paz?

35:40.863 --> 35:42.624
Charlie!

35:42.625 --> 35:45.266
Hold on. Everything's all right.
Everything's gonna be fine.

35:45.267 --> 35:47.228
No, no, you don't understand.
You don't understand.

35:47.229 --> 35:49.551
I've lost it.

35:49.552 --> 35:51.993
My connection to the universe
has been severed.

35:53.756 --> 35:55.437
I hear nothing.

35:55.438 --> 35:56.798
Only the noise!

35:56.799 --> 35:58.560
It's gone. It's gone for good!

35:58.561 --> 36:00.522
What's gone? What's gone?

36:00.523 --> 36:02.724
Charlie, you have to help me, okay?

36:02.725 --> 36:05.086
Listen, with your visions, you can...

36:05.087 --> 36:08.249
you can communicate for me
and find out what I did wrong.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.290
You haven't done anything wrong.

36:09.291 --> 36:11.453
I did! I must have.

36:11.454 --> 36:14.456
I don't know. Something's not right.

36:14.457 --> 36:16.177
I feel like...

36:16.178 --> 36:18.219
I let her down.

36:18.220 --> 36:19.621
That's what happened... I let her down.

36:19.622 --> 36:21.342
Who are you talking about? Who's her?

36:21.343 --> 36:24.466
See? This is how it was before
I had the clarity, right?

36:24.467 --> 36:26.988
This is how it was before.
The voices in my head...

36:26.989 --> 36:28.309
They're all just talking all at once.

36:28.310 --> 36:29.951
I can't make them out.

36:31.994 --> 36:34.275
Now I'm back there again.

36:34.276 --> 36:36.438
I just lost the clarity.

36:37.304 --> 36:38.560
All right. Listen to me.

36:38.561 --> 36:40.281
It's gone.
Listen to me.

36:40.282 --> 36:42.363
I'm gonna help you find some clarity.

36:47.970 --> 36:49.531
Hey.

36:49.532 --> 36:51.372
I didn't expect to hear from you.

36:51.373 --> 36:53.174
What's the trigger word?
What?

36:53.175 --> 36:55.577
The trigger word.
That's how you do it, right?

36:55.578 --> 36:56.978
You hypnotize him.

36:56.979 --> 36:58.580
You feed him all the information.

36:58.581 --> 36:59.981
He thinks it's his gift.

37:00.327 --> 37:01.503
Charlie, what's going on?

37:01.504 --> 37:03.264
He's having some kind of episode.

37:03.265 --> 37:05.587
Claims the universe
has stopped talking to him.

37:05.874 --> 37:08.251
And, apparently, the universe is a she?

37:08.791 --> 37:10.832
This is my fault.

37:10.833 --> 37:12.754
I haven't worked with him for weeks.

37:13.715 --> 37:15.677
Because you've been working with me.

37:15.678 --> 37:17.158
Yes.

37:17.159 --> 37:19.040
Well, he needs his fix.

37:19.041 --> 37:20.883
Tell me the word or do I have to guess?

37:22.485 --> 37:24.245
Verite.

37:24.246 --> 37:25.246
It's French.
French.

37:25.247 --> 37:27.008
I know it.

37:27.009 --> 37:28.409
What are you gonna do?

37:28.410 --> 37:29.931
I'm gonna give him the help he needs.

37:40.783 --> 37:42.465
Verite.

38:07.570 --> 38:10.188
I'm not feeling quite myself.

38:11.481 --> 38:13.655
I wonder if you can help me?
Of course. Of course.

38:13.656 --> 38:15.937
Okay, I'm gonna take you someplace safe,
okay?

38:15.938 --> 38:18.620
Oh, my retreat! This weekend.

38:18.621 --> 38:21.422
Uh, let's not focus on that right now,
Paz.

38:21.423 --> 38:23.304
I can't let my seekers down.

38:23.305 --> 38:24.666
They need my guidance.

38:24.667 --> 38:26.496
I don't want you worrying about that.

38:27.550 --> 38:30.031
You'll do it.
What?

38:30.032 --> 38:31.433
Charlie, please.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.074
Take over the retreat.

38:33.075 --> 38:35.637
They need help as much as I do.

38:35.638 --> 38:37.358
I can't.

38:37.359 --> 38:38.760
Maggie will be there.

38:38.761 --> 38:40.718
She'll talk you through it.

38:42.364 --> 38:44.285
Let's get you checked out.

38:44.286 --> 38:45.608
I think that's a good idea.

38:57.660 --> 39:00.182
Homemade muffins.

39:03.305 --> 39:05.243
Made them myself.

39:05.988 --> 39:08.029
I've got an extra if
you want to try one.

39:08.030 --> 39:10.031
I'm watching my waist.

39:10.331 --> 39:12.167
Forgive my rudeness.

39:12.955 --> 39:15.117
Alfonso Marks.

39:18.441 --> 39:20.442
My mother told me where to find you.

39:20.443 --> 39:21.883
I hope that's okay.

39:21.884 --> 39:23.845
What else did she tell you?

39:23.846 --> 39:26.327
That you've been looking for me.

39:26.328 --> 39:29.812
Or looking into me, I should say.

39:31.454 --> 39:33.014
You're here to turn yourself in.

39:34.657 --> 39:37.620
I'm just a guy who owns a strip mall.

39:39.181 --> 39:40.622
I'm not that interesting.

39:40.623 --> 39:42.944
But I've seen some things...

39:42.945 --> 39:44.532
know some things...

39:46.367 --> 39:48.070
that might be.

39:50.352 --> 39:51.833
I've got a feeling, Foster,

39:51.834 --> 39:54.716
that you and I are
gonna be great friends.

39:54.717 --> 39:59.080
Well, that depends, Mr. Marks.

39:59.081 --> 40:02.604
There are a lot of rules
involved in being my friend.

40:02.605 --> 40:05.887
And it usually requires
making a few new enemies.

40:05.888 --> 40:07.970
I got plenty of those.

40:12.374 --> 40:14.457
What's a few more.

40:28.431 --> 40:30.111
Dad.

40:30.112 --> 40:31.833
Hey.

40:31.834 --> 40:33.875
I thought you left for the retreat?

40:33.876 --> 40:35.837
I-I stopped by the hospital first.

40:35.838 --> 40:37.439
What the hell are you
doing home from school?

40:37.440 --> 40:39.961
We just had a half day.
Some administrative holiday.

40:39.962 --> 40:41.523
Nick, come on.

40:41.524 --> 40:43.605
You know better than
to try to lie to me.

40:43.606 --> 40:44.726
Dad, I was gonna fail.

40:44.727 --> 40:46.488
Fail what?
A science test.

40:46.489 --> 40:48.930
II just... I didn't study hard enough.

40:48.931 --> 40:51.391
Uh... I was helping Mom out at the shop.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.935
That's not the real reason.

40:55.228 --> 40:56.938
It's your texting.

40:56.939 --> 40:58.740
You're not studying hard enough.

40:58.741 --> 41:00.542
Got it?
Got it.

41:00.543 --> 41:01.983
Now, I'm gonna be gone till Sunday.

41:01.984 --> 41:03.384
You gonna be okay? Yeah. Yeah.

41:03.385 --> 41:05.947
II-I'm... I'm 16, Dad.

41:06.869 --> 41:08.551
Exactly.

41:10.913 --> 41:13.314
I know I haven't been home that much,

41:13.315 --> 41:15.236
but I'm gonna make it up to you.

41:15.237 --> 41:17.118
How about we go to Six Flags
next weekend?

41:17.119 --> 41:18.480
Yeah. Yeah, cool.

41:18.481 --> 41:19.836
Here.

41:21.764 --> 41:23.605
When I come home, I don't want to see

41:23.606 --> 41:26.007
empty pizza boxes all over the place.

41:26.008 --> 41:29.050
Why don't you take your mom
somewhere nice, okay?

41:29.051 --> 41:30.291
Okay?

41:30.292 --> 41:31.693
Okay.

41:31.694 --> 41:33.600
Call me if you need anything.

41:52.114 --> 41:53.635
I thought he was gonna
come in here for a second.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.116
Yeah.

41:55.117 --> 41:57.318
He's got, like,
20 things on his mind right now,

41:57.319 --> 41:59.641
so none of them are me.

41:59.642 --> 42:01.523
I know the feeling.

42:09.131 --> 42:10.892
So, I, uh, have to be back

42:10.893 --> 42:12.574
in front of the school by 2:30.

42:12.575 --> 42:14.657
Sharon's picking me up.

42:19.341 --> 42:20.862
So, uh...

42:20.863 --> 42:22.625
What do you want to do?

42:25.227 --> 42:27.949
It's like every time
there's a choice to be made,

42:27.950 --> 42:30.573
I make the wrong one.

42:31.193 --> 42:34.876
Maybe I need someone in my head
telling me what to think...

42:34.877 --> 42:37.599
telling me what to say.

42:37.600 --> 42:38.600
You already do.
Ohh!

42:40.883 --> 42:44.486
I'm not talking about me...
I'm talking about Maggie.

42:44.487 --> 42:46.207
Isn't that how your little trick works?

42:46.208 --> 42:48.675
She's literally in your ear.

42:50.009 --> 42:51.693
What the hell are you doing here?

42:51.694 --> 42:53.374
Just hitching a ride to the retreat

42:53.375 --> 42:54.896
with your buddy here.

42:54.897 --> 42:56.778
By the way,
why does he get the front seat?

42:56.779 --> 42:58.060
He doesn't even talk.

43:00.022 --> 43:01.703
Come on.

43:01.704 --> 43:04.866
You were just talking about
how much you missed us.

43:04.867 --> 43:06.347
Wait.

43:06.348 --> 43:07.989
You're a vision.

43:07.990 --> 43:10.992
Or maybe a fantasy.

43:10.993 --> 43:13.114
I'd ask why Murphy was here,

43:13.115 --> 43:14.836
but then, your interests have been

43:14.837 --> 43:16.758
quite progressive lately.

43:16.759 --> 43:20.361
How's it feel to be the one
with a side chick, Charlie?

43:20.362 --> 43:21.963
What do you want?

43:21.964 --> 43:24.085
That's not remotely the right question,

43:24.086 --> 43:25.847
but we'll get to that.

43:25.848 --> 43:28.329
You may want to pay a little
more attention to the road.

43:28.330 --> 43:32.093
Oh!

43:55.157 --> 43:58.720
Linda?

43:58.721 --> 43:59.801
Linda.
