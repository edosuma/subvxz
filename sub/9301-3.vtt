WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:30.238 --> 01:35.242
It's done, Skeletor.
I set up your activator.

01:35.271 --> 01:36.671
Near Mount Krona.

01:36.692 --> 01:40.255
Krona is the biggest
volcano in all of Eternia.

01:40.280 --> 01:43.546
When it erupts,
it will destroy everything.

01:43.670 --> 01:44.692
The fertile plains,

01:44.716 --> 01:48.730
The royal palace, everyone will
be forced to flee.

01:49.264 --> 01:54.661
And when they do,
we will make our move on Castle Grayskull.

01:57.508 --> 01:58.508
Watch!

02:13.131 --> 02:14.664
Never seen it this hot.

02:16.766 --> 02:21.160
Elmas, look! The volcano
is eruptin'. We better warn the others.

02:37.537 --> 02:39.126
Look up there! It's He-Man!

02:40.093 --> 02:43.176
A volcanic eruption!
Time to put this baby back to sleep.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.103
He-Man smothered the volcano.

03:06.422 --> 03:08.877
Too bad, I don't have
time for a steam bath.

03:10.709 --> 03:12.209
Thanks, He-Man!

03:14.129 --> 03:15.913
He-Man again!

03:15.938 --> 03:20.603
He's too smart for us, Skeletor.

03:21.761 --> 03:26.530
For you Beast Man, but not for me.
I have a plan to stop him for good.

03:27.148 --> 03:28.240
But how?

03:28.265 --> 03:30.715
With these two helmets.

03:30.740 --> 03:33.749
Two very special helmets.

03:34.693 --> 03:37.484
I will walk into the Royal
Palace and take Adam prisoner.

03:38.316 --> 03:44.559
No one will even see me, for
my helmet and I will be invisible.

03:45.712 --> 03:49.666
Once I have the Prince,
He-Man won't be far behind.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.689
This place is a mess. When was
the last time you saw the floor in here?

04:06.056 --> 04:08.549
Where I come from,
we never had to clean our rooms.

04:09.004 --> 04:10.079
Well, you do here.

04:13.097 --> 04:15.829
I hate cleaning my room,
this could take all year.

04:16.483 --> 04:21.603
My ol' bag 'o tricks. Maybe I can find a
little magic to clean up this mess.

04:22.278 --> 04:26.395
What's this? My old wand.
Now, what are the right words? Lets see...

04:27.142 --> 04:32.206
Hoblins, Goblins, Witches brew,
nah not that, hmm. Oh, How about this:

04:32.231 --> 04:37.293
Upside, downside, in between,
Magic wand make the room clean!

04:39.400 --> 04:40.400
Oh well.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.726
Last try. Let's see...

04:42.751 --> 04:44.915
Wand of Glass clean my room,

04:44.940 --> 04:46.341
sweeping through like a broom.

04:48.287 --> 04:49.487
Now we're cookin'.

05:00.111 --> 05:02.746
My father's really something Adam.
The Royal Zoo needed

05:02.771 --> 05:05.136
some wolfbats, so he invented this.

05:05.797 --> 05:09.370
A beeper? What does it do?
It attracts anything that flies.

05:12.411 --> 05:13.458
What's that?
Help!...

05:15.365 --> 05:16.431
It's Orko.

05:21.480 --> 05:25.530
Woah! It's my old wand,
I forgot how to stop it.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.403
Orko's magic does it again.

05:34.233 --> 05:40.943
My sword! It's gone. Uh oh!
What have I done?

05:41.812 --> 05:44.126
I can't believe it,
my sword really disappeared.

05:45.101 --> 05:47.250
It's all my fault.
Please don't tell Man-At-Arms.

05:47.989 --> 05:52.225
What's the matter with you two? It was only
a sword, and Orko can always get it back.

05:52.763 --> 05:54.054
I don't know how to get it back.

05:55.457 --> 05:58.417
Teela, alert your guards.
We found Skeletor's

05:58.442 --> 06:01.336
Doom Buster in the
woods, he must be nearby.

06:02.054 --> 06:05.627
On my way.
Adam, it's time for He-Man.

06:06.844 --> 06:12.852
He-Man? Yes, well go ahead...
I'll catch up.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.991
Thanks for not telling on me, Adam.
That's okay, but we gotta find that sword.

06:19.828 --> 06:23.863
I know, without it we can't...
Ssshh, what was that noise?

06:24.920 --> 06:26.562
It sounded as if someone just came in.

06:30.179 --> 06:33.321
Who's there?
Just an old friend.

06:35.097 --> 06:37.629
Skeletor?! How did you get in?

06:37.654 --> 06:40.945
The same way we are going to get out.

06:44.816 --> 06:45.887
Oh no, you don't!

06:52.640 --> 06:55.337
When you can move again,
you can tell your people. If they want

06:55.362 --> 06:57.909
Prince Adam back, send He-Man to get him.

06:59.856 --> 07:01.986
We'll be in the Banshee Jungle.

07:13.163 --> 07:16.483
So then my wand hit
Adam's sword and it just,

07:16.508 --> 07:20.048
disappeared.
Why didn't you tell me right away?

07:20.557 --> 07:25.182
I was afraid you'd be mad. Orko,
hiding a problem won't make it go away.

07:26.811 --> 07:31.967
That's some problem. What are we gonna do?
Maybe the Sorceress can help.

07:34.399 --> 07:39.124
I know what has happened. The answer's that
your wand sent Adam's sword back in time.

07:39.482 --> 07:40.816
Into Eternia's past.

07:42.406 --> 07:45.986
Is there a way to get it? Possibly.
There is a time corridor.

07:46.759 --> 07:51.113
But there are unknown dangers in the past.
I cannot protect you from them.

07:51.995 --> 07:57.623
Well, we have to try?! We're not afraid.
Oh, Speak for yourself.

07:57.671 --> 07:58.671
Very well, but

07:58.973 --> 08:03.951
Man-At-Arms must remain behind.
Why? I want to help too.

08:04.647 --> 08:08.199
There are many ways to help.
I have another task for you.

08:08.962 --> 08:11.382
Well, Cringer,
it looks like it's just you and me.

08:16.087 --> 08:17.551
Enter the time corridor.

08:33.989 --> 08:37.155
So now we wait patiently for He-Man.
What makes you

08:37.181 --> 08:40.476
think you can defeat He-Man?
Even if he does come.

08:41.135 --> 08:44.063
A good question. Here's my answer.

08:49.749 --> 08:51.692
It turned to stone.

08:51.717 --> 08:53.454
As will He-Man.

09:00.197 --> 09:03.927
To be sure you don't escape.
Laser bars.

09:03.952 --> 09:06.680
Enjoy your stay, Prince Adam!

09:09.293 --> 09:12.142
They may be waiting a long time
for He-Man to show up.

09:14.207 --> 09:20.944
What's this? Man-At-Arms' beeper. Teela
said it attracts anything that flies.

09:22.008 --> 09:27.367
Maybe I can attract Stratos.

09:27.992 --> 09:32.529
I just hope it brings Stratos
before it brings, wolfbats.

09:40.282 --> 09:43.439
This thing is actually starting
to look like He-Man.

09:43.464 --> 09:46.485
I wonder how Orko and Cringer
are getting along?

09:55.109 --> 09:57.606
Will you come on?

09:58.131 --> 10:00.457
Don't rush me.

10:00.882 --> 10:04.971
So this is the past, huh?

10:09.487 --> 10:14.073
It looks pleasant enough.

10:14.098 --> 10:15.601
Yeow!

10:19.626 --> 10:22.473
It's just a swamp hopper, relax will ya.

10:23.191 --> 10:26.231
Do you mind?
I get a little nervous, when I travel

10:26.256 --> 10:29.365
travel more than a hundred
years away from home.

10:30.128 --> 10:32.928
Don't worry Cringer,
I'll use my magic to defend us.

10:33.488 --> 10:39.025
Y-Your magic?
I'm in even worse trouble than I thought.

10:46.049 --> 10:47.853
Uh oh, Wolfbats!

10:54.876 --> 10:56.068
Cringer, look!

11:00.350 --> 11:04.188
A... giant!
And he's wearing one of my hats.

11:05.960 --> 11:12.054
He's got the sword.
How are we gonna get it from him?

11:12.565 --> 11:16.297
Man-At-Arms always says: if you
want something, ask politely.

11:17.934 --> 11:20.435
I donâ€™t think he meant giants.

11:22.375 --> 11:25.723
Excuse me, sir,
but I believe you have our sword.

11:30.453 --> 11:32.367
I see your point.
Have a nice day!

11:33.655 --> 11:37.128
Okay, big shot,
let's see your magic work now.

11:38.634 --> 11:41.434
I think that hat's a bit small.
Try this on for size?!

11:46.591 --> 11:48.056
Cringer quick, the sword!

11:57.724 --> 12:00.866
Let's get back to the time corridor!
I hope Adam's alright.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.559
Let's see if this robot works.

12:30.771 --> 12:32.418
Not bad.

12:38.043 --> 12:39.889
Not bad at all.

12:41.117 --> 12:42.621
Now back to Grayskull.

12:52.682 --> 12:56.464
I told you to quit yelling for help,
now we got the whole jungle after us.

12:57.709 --> 13:01.062
Just remember, who got the sword.
There's the corridor!

13:12.074 --> 13:14.080
There they are!

13:15.767 --> 13:17.638
Did you get the sword?

13:21.663 --> 13:25.894
Good work, you two.
Now we have work to do.

13:31.811 --> 13:38.458
He-Man? You're back. But how...?
No, no, it's just a robot of He-Man.

13:39.648 --> 13:41.948
Let's hope it fools
Skeletor, the way it fooled you.

13:52.626 --> 13:54.371
Get out of there! Stratos!

13:57.442 --> 13:58.442
Adam!

14:00.267 --> 14:03.292
Stay away from those laser bars.
They'll zap anything that touches them.

14:04.106 --> 14:07.975
How can I help?
Find Man-At-Arms, tell him where I am.

14:08.617 --> 14:11.026
I'll find him. Count on that.

14:15.363 --> 14:17.188
He's in a laser cage,
near the Cave of Cambro.

14:17.728 --> 14:20.335
We'll find him, you get word to Teela.
Right!

14:22.748 --> 14:25.397
Now, it's time for our
robot to go to work.

14:29.751 --> 14:32.931
Attak Trak,
use your sensors to find Skeletor!

14:33.869 --> 14:35.446
Affirmative!  Message: Understood.

14:35.856 --> 14:37.919
Try to decoy him if you can!

14:37.944 --> 14:40.153
What do you mean "if I can"?

14:46.391 --> 14:49.012
This time I'll have
He-Man where I want him,

14:51.100 --> 14:54.065
and Eternia will be ours.

14:54.090 --> 14:55.629
"Ours" fur face?

14:55.654 --> 14:57.042
I meant yours...

14:57.067 --> 14:58.851
Yours, of course

15:02.737 --> 15:05.652
There he is, He-Man!

15:06.289 --> 15:07.289
Attack!

15:19.153 --> 15:22.186
The coward is running! Lets take him now!

15:27.808 --> 15:30.141
Adam! Are you alright? Am I glad to

15:30.166 --> 15:32.433
see you. Have you found the sword?

15:33.171 --> 15:34.228
Right here. Good work!

15:43.530 --> 15:47.195
I can't reach it!

15:47.821 --> 15:50.136
I can! I'm small enough
to glide through the bars.

15:50.807 --> 15:53.528
No Orko, if you touch the
bars, they sould destroy you.

15:54.142 --> 15:56.094
I made your sword disappear
in the first place,

15:56.431 --> 15:58.023
now I'm gonna give it back to you.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.302
Nice going Orko!
You really came through!

16:06.560 --> 16:08.549
This is the part I like.

16:09.139 --> 16:11.705
By the power of Grayskull!

16:16.361 --> 16:20.828
Oh, this is the part, I-I don't like.

16:21.567 --> 16:25.300
I have the power!

16:39.783 --> 16:42.130
Now to break this and
smash through the wall!

16:48.360 --> 16:49.555
Thataway He-Man!

16:49.880 --> 16:53.091
I have a score to settle, with Skeletor.

17:05.412 --> 17:08.319
Now we have him!
I've waited a long time for this.

17:12.406 --> 17:16.865
So He-Man, we meet again.
Nothing to say?

17:18.727 --> 17:21.578
Whaddya say about being turned to stone?

17:23.930 --> 17:27.864
What's this?
It's nothing but a robot.

17:31.868 --> 17:35.629
Fool, they've lured us away to take
the Prince. Quick, back to the cave.

17:36.436 --> 17:38.821
Don't bother Skeletor. He-Man!

17:49.692 --> 17:51.157
Now, that was a kick!

18:02.879 --> 18:06.223
My Porta-Prison will hold you
until we get you to the Prison Mines.

18:07.444 --> 18:10.289
At last, well just you and me.

18:22.021 --> 18:26.408
My invisiblity helmet. Let's see how
you go against an enemy you can't see.

18:29.414 --> 18:30.991
Skeletor ?!

18:33.016 --> 18:35.745
Sitting down on the job He-Man?

18:35.845 --> 18:39.350
One thing's for sure,
I won't stand for you.

18:40.812 --> 18:46.186
Over here! I think I know how to
wrap you up, invisible or not.

18:51.103 --> 18:53.025
Orko, your robe, hurry!

19:00.939 --> 19:01.979
No!

19:04.703 --> 19:07.457
You won't be needing this!

19:11.398 --> 19:13.299
My Havoc Staff will take care of you!

19:18.364 --> 19:20.896
Lemme at him, He-Man! Let him go.

19:22.071 --> 19:25.262
He-Man, I-I don't understand.
You will, watch.

19:26.746 --> 19:28.958
Now we'll see how clever you
are, He-Man.

19:31.403 --> 19:33.568
No... Wolfbats!

19:40.942 --> 19:44.251
Too bad, Skeletor!

19:45.725 --> 19:47.795
Stop it, leave me alone!

19:53.327 --> 19:56.176
He-Man, how did you know the
wolfbats would go after Skeletor?

19:56.847 --> 20:00.885
Your beeper. I slipped it on Skeletor's
belt when I put Orko's robe on him.

20:01.581 --> 20:06.220
Quick thinking! Way to go He-Man, let's get
back to the Palace and tell the King.

20:06.438 --> 20:09.282
All you're gonna do when you get
back, is clean your room.

20:09.999 --> 20:12.783
Maybe I could use some
magic and help me and...

20:12.808 --> 20:15.127
Orko!
Well, I just thought because I...

20:15.243 --> 20:20.807
Orko! Well, I guess I don't
absolutely have to use magic but...

20:20.893 --> 20:21.893
Orko!

20:22.352 --> 20:25.083
Alright, alright,
I promise, no magic.

20:25.108 --> 20:26.228
Thank goodness!

20:33.160 --> 20:35.454
Being the most powerful
man in the universe

20:35.479 --> 20:37.929
isn't all that makes
He-Man such a great hero.

20:38.815 --> 20:42.201
Being strong is fine,
but there's something even better.

20:42.764 --> 20:45.425
In today's story,
He-Man used something even

20:45.450 --> 20:48.347
more powerful than his
muscles to beat Skeletor.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.419
Do you know what that was?

20:50.444 --> 20:52.535
If you said 'his
