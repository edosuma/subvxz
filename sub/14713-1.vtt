WEBVTT

00:24.225 --> 00:28.696
MIKE HALL: And I like the
thrill of the race. It's kind
of like being on the run,

00:28.762 --> 00:32.031
it's kind of like
being a fugitive, not
sticking around in one place

00:32.100 --> 00:36.137
for too long,
always thinking there's
somebody coming after you and,

00:36.204 --> 00:40.908
uh, that's... That's exciting.
That... That's kind
of like living in

00:40.974 --> 00:44.178
a little bit of a...
A story.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.879
It's almost like
a double life.

00:45.946 --> 00:49.517
There's something about
that... That's quite
a lot of fun.

00:52.153 --> 00:57.625
I think I got into racing
through the 24-hour
racing and so,

00:58.492 --> 01:00.628
um, I decided that,

01:00.694 --> 01:06.634
you know, one day,
I want to design my own
things, my own products,

01:06.700 --> 01:08.902
perhaps even my own bikes.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.771
But, first, I wanted to get
into the bike scene

01:10.838 --> 01:14.842
and I wanted to sort of
develop, yeah, some contacts

01:14.908 --> 01:19.847
and get my name known a bit
and have a good... Maybe have
a good couple of years

01:19.913 --> 01:25.153
racing just so that I've got
some pedigree, and a bit
of knowledge about that.

01:25.219 --> 01:28.189
And to put in
to the designs.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.591
And then, it kind of
got a hand, really.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.364
JULIANA BUHRING: Uh, I've only
really been cycling about two
and a half years.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.133
I started bicycling the
world having never
ridden a bike before

01:39.200 --> 01:42.102
that and did like a brief...

01:42.170 --> 01:46.740
Some months of training to
cycle the world and that's
when I learned how to

01:46.807 --> 01:47.841
ride a bike.

01:50.278 --> 01:55.115
Having grown up in, uh,
like this extremist cult
that I grew up in, right,

01:55.183 --> 01:58.552
I pretty much had a pretty
stunted childhood.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.854
It was like being
a bird in a cage

02:00.921 --> 02:04.725
and seeing the world
from behind high walls
and wanting to be in it

02:04.792 --> 02:09.330
and just wanting the freedom,
to experience the freedom,
of being myself

02:09.396 --> 02:13.100
and discovering
the world and...

02:13.167 --> 02:15.236
I fell in to really
deep depression

02:15.303 --> 02:17.238
and I... I lost
many friends.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.607
I lost my sister to suicide.

02:19.673 --> 02:23.744
So I guess I just sunk into
this really dark place,

02:23.811 --> 02:27.448
uh, and so I decided to cycle
the world to get out of that.

02:27.515 --> 02:32.753
Um, it was a
supposed drastic
move on my part as I...

02:32.820 --> 02:35.356
I wanted to escape
from the world,

02:35.423 --> 02:37.525
but, at the same time,
I wanted to discover it

02:37.591 --> 02:43.197
or discover my place in it.
So, that's why I set off
in the first place

02:43.264 --> 02:50.371
and, honestly, left thinking
that it was okay if
I didn't come back. I...

02:50.438 --> 02:55.008
I was perfectly okay to...
To just, yeah...

02:55.075 --> 02:56.977
To just go out there
and, you know,

02:57.044 --> 02:59.580
if I came back all right,
but I wasn't...

02:59.647 --> 03:03.284
I didn't make a plan like
a contingency plan... I...

03:03.351 --> 03:07.255
The entire journey really did
give me a passion for life,

03:07.321 --> 03:11.091
I rediscovered a purpose

03:11.158 --> 03:16.364
for existence and my place
in the world and, not only
that, I discovered cycling.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.566
I discovered that
I could cycle.

03:18.632 --> 03:22.703
HALL: So, after that, yeah,
after the 24-hour races,
there was The Tour Divide

03:22.770 --> 03:25.172
the first time and
that changed things

03:25.239 --> 03:30.043
and changed my view
of the races I wanted to do.

03:30.110 --> 03:35.616
And, so then I went to do
the "Around the world" race,
that was successful.

03:35.683 --> 03:40.220
I wanted to go then go back
and do The Tour Divide
and do better than I did

03:40.288 --> 03:46.527
and I went and I won it.
And then, the August
of that year,

03:46.594 --> 03:50.664
we put on a race called
The Transcontinental which
was designed to be

03:50.731 --> 03:54.402
a little bit like a race
across America in Europe

03:54.468 --> 03:56.504
but with no support

03:56.570 --> 04:02.543
BUHRING: Self-supported,
ultra endurance racing is to
me, probably like the X Games

04:02.610 --> 04:07.114
of endurance cycling,
so it's taking it to
the next level and a level

04:07.180 --> 04:12.620
that the majority of people,
even racers who might do the,

04:12.686 --> 04:16.690
you know, professional racers
who do the Giro d'Italia,
who do the Tour de France

04:16.757 --> 04:21.228
uh, who do the RAAM,
um, might not actually
ever participate in

04:21.295 --> 04:24.532
because they are so used to
a controlled environment,

04:24.598 --> 04:27.368
going back at the end
of the day to a nice hotel,

04:27.435 --> 04:29.937
getting a massage,
having the perfect diet,

04:30.003 --> 04:31.805
having the drinks
handed to them,

04:31.872 --> 04:36.310
food handed to them,
everything is
five-star cycling

04:36.377 --> 04:39.480
whereas this is just
for the crazies.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.649
NARRATOR:
This is the Trans-Am
Bike Race.

04:41.715 --> 04:45.786
4,233 miles
across 10 states.

04:45.853 --> 04:50.824
There are no support teams,
no stages, and no stopping
at check points.

04:50.891 --> 04:55.028
The race starts in Astoria,
Oregon, then follows the
infamous Trans-America

04:55.095 --> 04:59.299
bike route over the
Rocky Mountains, across the
Great Plains,

04:59.367 --> 05:04.672
and through the Appalachians,
then finally finishes in
Yorktown, Virginia.

05:04.738 --> 05:08.008
This is the story of those
inspired to dream big

05:08.075 --> 05:13.113
and discover not only what's
on the other side but what we
are truly capable of.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.917
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

05:16.984 --> 05:18.552
NATHAN JONES: All right,
good morning, folks.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.821
I'm Nathan Jones and I
want to thank all of y'all.

05:20.888 --> 05:25.025
Forty five of you for taking
part in the first ever
Trans-Am Bike Race.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.728
Pay attention to
the alternate routes.

05:27.795 --> 05:32.199
There's few which may be
faster all of which
are in play.

05:32.265 --> 05:36.970
Make sure all of your spot GPS
tracking units are functional.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.672
Make sure your batteries
are good in 'em.

05:38.739 --> 05:42.009
Finally, I can't say how
grateful I am for y'all
to come out here.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.778
Did not sleep last night.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.716
I was tossing and
turning all night.

05:53.454 --> 05:56.289
MAN 1: Well, I said good-bye
to my girlfriend so I'm
definitely going now.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.125
(LAUGHING)
JONES: Off we go!

05:58.191 --> 06:00.528
(CHEERING)

06:02.329 --> 06:04.131
MAN 2: Are we going
to have fun?

06:04.197 --> 06:07.401
MAN 1: Yeah!
It's gonna be a blast!

06:23.851 --> 06:25.953
A little toasty out here,
right now.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.456
I think we need a little rain
just to cool up a little bit.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.657
I'm getting a little
overheated.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.358
It's a, it's a bit
chilly out here.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.263
There's a coffee shop around
here somewhere.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.798
EDDIE CLARK:
This is Mike Hall.

06:37.865 --> 06:42.803
He is starting late
to stay out of the limelight

06:42.870 --> 06:45.539
and now, he's riding
through the field.

06:45.606 --> 06:50.277
Probably a good tactic
to keep people from
following his wheel

06:50.343 --> 06:52.546
'cause now,
they're strung out,

06:52.613 --> 06:55.148
they're into it, probably
already pegged themselves
right off the bat.

06:55.215 --> 06:58.886
He's just going to ride
through them and do
his thing, I think.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.021
Oh, and then
Mike passed me.

07:01.088 --> 07:04.424
It's easy to get caught up in
that, like, mental game of

07:04.492 --> 07:06.660
like getting passed
by the fast guys

07:06.727 --> 07:08.896
and trying to push and trying
to do all that,

07:08.962 --> 07:13.433
and I'm just like it's not
my thing, it's not like,
what are you doing?

07:13.501 --> 07:16.770
It's like debilitating when
you're like making a climb
and you're like,

07:16.837 --> 07:19.172
I'm already day-dreaming about
the food I'm gonna have,

07:19.239 --> 07:21.441
and then, you hear like a...
(WHOOSHING)

07:21.509 --> 07:24.945
Coming up behind you, and
he's like, "Yeah, missed
a turn, mate."

07:27.781 --> 07:29.349
MAN: Where are you
riding to?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.719
Virginia.

07:31.785 --> 07:35.623
Virginia, are you serious?
Oh wow, that's a long way!

07:35.689 --> 07:40.961
MAN: She's, uh, not going
in the right direction.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.665
We can't take the 101?

07:46.967 --> 07:49.837
I'll take the next left and
go on to the coast.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.371
MAN: Is that really an option?

07:51.438 --> 07:53.106
People are going
to see it on the maps,

07:53.173 --> 07:54.808
everyone's
looking at the blue dots.
Everyone's watching her.

07:54.875 --> 07:59.279
It's parallels, it's
not cutting mileage,
it's the same mileage.

07:59.346 --> 08:03.283
There's a bunch of
alternate routes to the
Trans-America trail

08:03.350 --> 08:08.155
and when I set up the rules,
I posted any alternate
is legitimate.

08:08.221 --> 08:12.693
It's part of the official
routes so they're all...
Anybody who did it is not

08:12.760 --> 08:14.194
a disqualified
or anything.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.652
Hey!
Hello!

09:12.753 --> 09:14.888
Boy, these guys
are just unbelievable.

09:14.955 --> 09:18.558
But, you know, last year,
for my 62nd birthday,

09:18.626 --> 09:22.195
I rode from Fort Bragg
to San Luis Obispo.

09:22.262 --> 09:26.166
For me, it was just a grueling
test of physical and
mental being, you know.

09:26.233 --> 09:30.203
I'm a Vietnam veteran,
disabled and I am just
so grateful, you know,

09:30.270 --> 09:34.241
I've been to prison,
drug addict, alcoholic,
blah, blah, blah.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.745
You know, I went through
it all, and now I have
a lot of spirituality.

09:37.811 --> 09:41.414
'Cause one thing about
riding your bike, you can
only focus on one thing.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.617
That's riding your bike.

09:43.684 --> 09:49.222
I rode 11 hours yesterday
and only went about 43 miles,
but I pushed my bike a whole

09:49.289 --> 09:55.262
bunch 'cause it's just too...
Way too big to push up
the hill, you know.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.329
So...

10:03.036 --> 10:08.108
(CRYING) This is for all the
guys that can't be out there,
there's a lot of 'em.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.146
I'm a real emotional guy
when it comes to that.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.782
Thank you,
God bless you, guys.

10:30.463 --> 10:35.769
MAN: You guys are freaking
animals. You rocked it
today, you know.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.237
I feel like one.

10:37.304 --> 10:41.108
Yeah? I was keeping up
with this guy behind me here.

10:41.174 --> 10:44.144
I don't know if
I'll make it over.
I'll start in, you know.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.946
I want to ride
at least till 11.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.948
For me, it's going
to depend on how
cold it gets.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.317
I get really cold
at night.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.286
So, I'm not going to risk
sleeping high if it's really
cold out there. So, I'll...

10:53.353 --> 10:57.190
I'm going to start it
and if it gets cold,
I'll push over.

10:57.257 --> 11:01.228
MAN: So, Ed and Jessie,
they just busted up about
two minutes ago.

11:01.294 --> 11:05.465
Oh, really?
Um, did you tell him
how far I was behind?

11:05.532 --> 11:08.902
Talk to you later.
Cheers.

11:08.969 --> 11:12.339
We drove up ahead after
just chatting with those guys
at the bottom there.

11:12.405 --> 11:19.212
We were sleeping on the road,
I heard a gear shift and,
uh... And a British accent,

11:19.279 --> 11:25.385
"Hey guys", Mike Hall
whizzed by like, uh...
Like he was 10 miles into

11:25.452 --> 11:31.558
the beginning of a ride
and he's well over 300 miles
and he just blew by this gate.

11:31.624 --> 11:34.762
Mike is super human.
(LAUGHING)

11:34.828 --> 11:37.364
That guy can pass so fast.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.968
It was like we were
just sitting there.
Crazy.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.172
MAN:
So, did you get that text?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.706
No, what text?

11:46.774 --> 11:49.943
So, Juliana... I just got
a text, two words,
"Bad crash."

11:50.010 --> 11:52.946
And, we see her up, ah...
Going up on the pass
on the other side,

11:53.013 --> 11:54.247
two hours away from here.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.916
I am going to
try to call her.

11:56.850 --> 11:57.851
Yeah.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.120
And merge...
Merge this call.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.654
Are you okay...
Are you okay?

12:11.832 --> 12:16.269
Let it play out 30, 45 minutes
'cause two things will happen.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.206
The shaken up part wears off

12:20.507 --> 12:23.877
and allows her...

12:23.944 --> 12:27.848
Whoever's with her to
first access is she
really hurt bad.

12:27.915 --> 12:33.253
You know, concussion sort
of thing or just scared,
you know, shocked,

12:33.320 --> 12:36.389
freaked out a little bit
'cause you crashed and that's
scary when that happens.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.627
And then also, obviously if
there's any other, like,

12:41.528 --> 12:43.831
injuries, flesh wounds,

12:43.897 --> 12:45.698
possible fractures,
anything like that,

12:45.765 --> 12:47.801
then, flesh wounds
you can patch up.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.670
Fractures, that's probably
end of the race.

12:50.737 --> 12:55.275
I've got so much
more living to do.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.145
Where is everybody?
Did you hear what
happened to Juliana?

12:58.211 --> 13:04.651
She went over her handle bars,
bruised her sternum bad.
I cleaned up her knee,

13:04.717 --> 13:09.823
and then, I called... The guy
that brought her into his
pickup called the paramedics.

13:09.890 --> 13:13.861
I'm doped up
on ibuprofen.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.428
MAN: Really?
Yeah.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.565
So sorry, I mean,
that sucks that you
had a crash, huh?

13:18.631 --> 13:21.701
It's kind of my fault. Well,
the sun was just rising,
it got right in my eyes

13:21.768 --> 13:23.904
and I didn't have
my glasses on,
so I didn't see this

13:23.971 --> 13:27.140
giant rock on the road.
Basically, just went
right into it.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.842
Boom, the bike went flying.

13:28.909 --> 13:32.612
Oh, that's...
Fortunately, A guy in a truck
saw me and I literally

13:32.679 --> 13:37.084
saw stars, and then, I was
like basically fainted
and he got me... He got me

13:37.150 --> 13:43.623
in his car and took me
to a restaurant just around
the corner and called a medic,

13:43.690 --> 13:45.425
I guess he was a medic.

13:45.492 --> 13:50.397
I was a bit in shock,
so I just waited till I
calmed enough to go again.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.832
It's more of
a big bruise, really.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.301
Yeah!
Road rash.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.802
(CHUCKLES)

13:55.869 --> 13:57.971
Do you see a big lump?
I have had this before
because I have ridden

13:58.038 --> 13:59.839
on cracked rib before.

13:59.907 --> 14:05.112
In the next three, four days
will be the worst, the pain
will only get worse.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.248
I don't feel like I'm doing
some incredible riding yet.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.683
Usually takes me
about five days

14:10.750 --> 14:15.388
to warm up and then,
I can just go and go, go.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.725
So, at the moment I am in
kind of a jam. My body is
kind of acclimatizing.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.962
So, I'm hoping
once it's acclimatized,
I can get up to like

14:22.029 --> 14:23.897
260 a day, at least.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.034
HALL: This is hard work.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.304
Yeah, Jason's about
half an hour ahead

14:32.639 --> 14:34.942
and, I don't think
he slept last night.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.210
Um,

14:38.045 --> 14:40.213
so,

14:40.280 --> 14:44.051
yeah, it's been pretty
intense. He finished RAAM in
nine days or something.

14:45.152 --> 14:48.388
So, that's a quick ride.

14:49.689 --> 14:54.627
So, I think he's going for
no sleep at the moment,

14:54.694 --> 15:01.668
he's got all of his powder
on him and he just
has a liquid diet but

15:02.970 --> 15:04.371
he's going to
struggle in the hills.

15:06.873 --> 15:11.578
It's quite easy to ride up
to him but he's not stopping.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.481
Every time I stop, I need
a good advantage there.

15:34.801 --> 15:38.138
MAN: Mike Hall, back in
number one position.

15:38.205 --> 15:41.474
I always think he's like
40 miles up the road
and all of a sudden,

15:41.541 --> 15:44.911
we're on a climb
and he kind of scoots
up beside me again.

15:44.978 --> 15:48.548
I haven't slept yet,
the original plan was to
till 1:00 this morning,

15:48.615 --> 15:53.120
like tonight but, normally,
I've got a van like that,
sitting right there,

15:53.186 --> 15:57.024
handing me
water bottles but

15:57.090 --> 16:00.893
this a little bit
different. I just couldn't
afford to do RAAM again,

16:00.960 --> 16:03.796
so I was a little bit...
I don't have to pay
for a crew this way, right?

16:07.900 --> 16:11.171
I, actually, was ahead
of Mike Hall for one
point of the race.

16:11.238 --> 16:15.608
I'd like the record
to very clearly show that.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.345
Like, that's my strategy,
like I'm not the fastest
guy out here

16:18.411 --> 16:20.480
but I can
out camp him.

16:20.547 --> 16:23.683
And take him at night
when they're not expecting it.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.286
They wake up in the morning
and they're like, "What?"

16:26.353 --> 16:31.191
People at the front
are riding way too fast,
it's insane.

16:31.258 --> 16:34.494
I think Mike Hall just hit
the 500 mile mark

16:34.561 --> 16:39.232
and it's been...
See, it's 2:00 now...

16:39.299 --> 16:45.272
Seven, nine...
That's 33 hours,
500 miles, like,

16:45.338 --> 16:47.607
kind of, hurts my brain.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.911
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

16:51.978 --> 16:55.482
We're done with Trans-Am
but we're going to
do it a little longer.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.450
(ALL CHUCKLING)
That's okay.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.887
I don't know, I guess I had
expected they'll be at
an average somewhere

17:00.953 --> 17:06.025
in the 100 to 125 miles a day,
so that's why I was really
shocked to see those guys

17:06.093 --> 17:08.095
are this far, this early.

17:08.161 --> 17:12.632
I retired a little over
a year ago. I found at
the end of each day,

17:12.699 --> 17:14.934
I had accomplished nothing.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.670
So, um,

17:17.737 --> 17:23.076
my friend that lives in Oregon
and I live in Richmond,
Virginia, decided that we do

17:23.143 --> 17:28.648
a little tour, like,
together this summer, so,
we had no set agenda,

17:28.715 --> 17:31.284
we are riding
Trans-Am, and,

17:31.351 --> 17:35.288
ah, the reason being,
it lends itself to the route
that we want plus the history

17:35.355 --> 17:37.056
associated with this.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.025
We're just having fun,
riding our bikes.

17:39.692 --> 17:42.162
End of story.

17:42.229 --> 17:46.433
FRANZISKA HOLLENDER: And, I
got into cycling only, almost
a year ago, last August.

17:46.499 --> 17:51.003
I had never cycled before,
like, and I failed at a lot
of things in my past,

17:51.070 --> 17:54.374
so I decided to do something
very different.

17:54.441 --> 17:58.211
It's kind of fun to not be
failing at this right now.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.046
MAN: Okay.
HOLLENDER: Feeling strong.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.782
PETA MCSHARRY: I am ecstatic,
just loving the scenery,

18:02.849 --> 18:06.419
loving chatting to people,
in a way,

18:06.486 --> 18:08.455
I... I am super
competitive.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.658
Obviously, need to go
and check and see
where Juliana is.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.327
'Cause, I'm going to have
to get some sneaky,
little strategy going,

18:14.394 --> 18:17.330
I think, um, just to
try and catch her.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.498
I can't, I can't let her go.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.541
I got about five and
a half hours of sleep

18:28.608 --> 18:33.413
and then, uh, I went through
Baker City pretty early,
so there wasn't much open

18:33.480 --> 18:39.186
and then pushed on and
had breakfast about 30
something miles back.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.889
So, feeling the energy
kicking in now,

18:42.955 --> 18:47.394
had some pancakes and
hash browns, that was good.

18:47.460 --> 18:51.264
Try and make sure I don't
pass them, post office 'cause
I'm picking something up here,

18:51.331 --> 18:53.500
I ain't turning around.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.968
This is going to turn into
like a 24-hour post office
sprints unfortunately,

18:56.035 --> 18:57.670
so I can
continue drinking my food.

18:57.737 --> 18:58.938
It's better than Christmas.

19:00.307 --> 19:04.911
I found in the past,
as soon as I started eating

19:04.977 --> 19:11.751
real food, it makes you tired,
it makes you sleepy tired and
it makes you kind of slow.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.587
It's kind of heavy.

19:14.654 --> 19:19.626
It's not really a bike
pack in ideal situation.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.366
Did you, by any chance,
see another rider?

19:26.433 --> 19:31.070
I've got... I'm pretty loaded,
I'm by myself, so I've got
everything that I need.

19:31.137 --> 19:36.476
My name is Joanna Abernethy
and I am from Australia and
I am doing this because

19:36.543 --> 19:41.214
I want to do a tribute ride
to Martin Luther King,
that's the reason I am doing

19:41.281 --> 19:44.851
this ride 'cause it was
his 50 year anniversary

19:44.917 --> 19:49.155
of the "I Have a Dream" speech
last year and that's when
I decided to do it.

19:49.222 --> 19:53.192
There hasn't been a single
person who has had anything
negative to say,

19:53.260 --> 19:57.630
they might say negative things
about Barack Obama
or the government but not...

19:57.697 --> 20:02.269
Everybody, even the most
surprising people, said Martin
Luther King was a good man.

20:48.715 --> 20:52.419
HALL: That was
a long, long stretch.

20:52.485 --> 20:56.323
I've just been to
the lodge there, it's
not open, but it's...

20:56.389 --> 20:58.958
I just got brushed and
what have you.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.894
So I slept in the... In one of
the camp ground toilets

21:01.961 --> 21:03.863
for an hour and
a half last night.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.434
And I thought I was
going to sort of play
him at his own game and try

21:07.500 --> 21:09.235
and stay ahead and stretch
the lead out

21:09.302 --> 21:12.004
and so I can get maybe a bit
of a longer break.

21:12.071 --> 21:17.910
Yeah, 72 hours in, um,
three and a half,

21:17.977 --> 21:21.648
four and a half hours
of sleep, maybe.

21:21.714 --> 21:26.353
I haven't seen my feet
since... My bare feet,
since Astoria.

21:26.419 --> 21:29.922
Um, I'd probably have
to check those out
sometime later today.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.660
Oh, I'm...
I'm in Idaho.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.996
I couldn't believe it.

21:37.063 --> 21:42.301
It's a stepping stone
to Montana, then Wyoming,
and so, I want to get

21:42.369 --> 21:45.872
through these and like
just survive for four days,

21:45.938 --> 21:49.642
heal on the back side
of the Rocky's, and then, um,

21:49.709 --> 21:51.511
see what's left.

21:51.578 --> 21:55.181
I just like kind of
a challenge of, you know,
pretty soon I'm going to be...

21:55.247 --> 21:57.817
I'm going to be gone
and I'm gonna be
a memory for my kids.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.553
And, uh,

22:00.620 --> 22:03.656
my father, who passed
away recently said...

22:03.723 --> 22:06.726
You know, um,
I don't want to
get choked up.

22:06.793 --> 22:10.329
He always said, "Son,
don't settle for a triple

22:10.397 --> 22:12.264
"when you should've
run all of the bases."

22:12.331 --> 22:13.866
MAN: Mmm-hmm.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.702
WILLIAMS: You know,
go for it, hit a home run.

22:20.673 --> 22:24.777
I spoiled myself. I had, um,
a half a box of Milk Duds,

22:24.844 --> 22:26.579
frozen so you
can savor them,

22:26.646 --> 22:28.214
you know, for
a long time

22:28.280 --> 22:31.083
and then, I finished off a
day-old Subway sandwich.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.219
Oh man, I'll tell you what,
I think the shelf life
on those

22:33.285 --> 22:35.955
is at least two days.
Is anything hurting?

22:36.022 --> 22:37.924
A better way to question is
"What isn't hurting?"

22:37.990 --> 22:39.125
That's a better question.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.893
'Cause everything is hurting.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.162
I think my saddle sores have
saddle sores at this point.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.070

yourself out for us.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.371

than finding a trail angel

with a bottle of water,

uh, tipped over 1000 miles.

nearly doubled us.

I don't think
there is anybody...

we get like, we get,

23:47.794 --> 23:48.961
I heard we get seven days.

than that...

you pass them up?

twice yesterday,

I think they're destroyed.
Yeah.

They, they, they didn't
look too good, you know.

26:45.471 --> 26:46.973
I wonder if one of
them had heat stroke

'cause I passed one
at the descent

26:48.941 --> 26:51.644
when it was like 85 out

26:51.711 --> 26:54.847
and he was wearing a
jacket and going slow,

26:54.914 --> 26:56.683
I was like,
"That's not good."

26:56.749 --> 26:59.218
Yeah, yeah, I saw him
sitting out there he
looked really rough,

26:59.285 --> 27:01.453
he called me over
and I was like,
"Hey, you all right?"

27:01.520 --> 27:03.723
He was like he's like

27:03.790 --> 27:05.357
"How many hours do
you pedal every day?"

27:05.424 --> 27:07.193
I was like, "About,
I don't know like...

"Depends on the day, maybe
between 14 to 16 hours."

morning, I got up at 6:00,

Jason is still in Wisdom.

So, um, I think my
margin's still safe.

27:25.277 --> 27:28.247
So, I'm, I'm happy that I'm
rested and ready to do more.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.950
I was pretty much
ruined by last night.

27:31.017 --> 27:35.421
Ran out of caffeine and
things like that,
so it's, uh...

27:35.487 --> 27:37.423
Yeah, I couldn't have,
I couldn't have gone

27:37.489 --> 27:39.325
much longer on
that kind of regime.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.860
It's, it's getting
a bit silly.

27:43.763 --> 27:46.098
Oh, yeah!

27:46.165 --> 27:47.934
It's okay,
it'll be all right.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.037
I couldn't have been
happier with the way
that today was going.

27:51.103 --> 27:54.006
I was easily going to get
another 150 miles in,

27:54.073 --> 27:56.208
um, like, no problem.

27:56.275 --> 27:59.211
As soon as I get
to the bottom,
I start peddling,

27:59.278 --> 28:02.949
there's this horrible noise.
I peddle again,
it does it again,

28:03.015 --> 28:07.686
I get off the bike and this,
the bottom bracket is cracked
all the way through.

28:07.754 --> 28:10.156
I'm having my mountain bike

28:10.222 --> 28:13.425
sent here and it'll be
here at 4:30 tomorrow.

28:13.492 --> 28:19.098
I'm going to take
everything off of the
the bike that I'm on,

28:19.165 --> 28:22.434
and put it on the yo-yo bike

28:22.501 --> 28:24.103
and I'm going to chase them
down on a mountain bike.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.072
Everybody from, uh,

28:26.138 --> 28:29.909
from Mike, all the way
to the Lanterne Rouge

28:29.976 --> 28:33.045
is giving 110%

28:33.112 --> 28:35.114
to stay in this thing,

28:35.181 --> 28:37.116
whatever their 110% is.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.785
I even messaged Mike Hall.

28:38.851 --> 28:41.220
I was like "Dude, do not let
this RAAM guy get up there."

28:41.287 --> 28:43.122
(LAUGHING)

28:49.195 --> 28:52.965
MAN: Day six,
Mike Hall, day six!
Yeah!

28:53.032 --> 28:55.434
I don't know where
Jason is, but,

28:55.501 --> 28:58.404
he could be on me
by now, I don't know.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.239
Did you guys catch up
with him last night?

29:00.306 --> 29:01.473
MAN: No!
All right!

29:01.540 --> 29:02.975
MAN: We're
going there right now.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.610
A little brisk
this morning, huh?

29:06.378 --> 29:09.248
LANE: I'll just keep riding at
the same pace as I can.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.717
I can't really
go any faster, so,

29:12.952 --> 29:15.387
if that catches him
then that's great.

29:15.454 --> 29:16.989
It's tougher mileage
than you think,

29:17.957 --> 29:19.325
like for everybody.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.961
When I...
I was like, yeah,

29:22.028 --> 29:25.497
kind of the 285,

29:25.564 --> 29:28.500
290 a day, maybe,
300 on good days,

29:29.869 --> 29:32.238
and then, you kind of...

29:32.304 --> 29:35.641
You just realize how
much extra time looking
after yourself takes.

29:35.707 --> 29:38.444
Getting water, food,

29:38.510 --> 29:39.846
making sure
your bike's okay,

29:41.147 --> 29:43.215
that all adds up.
Then you get tired.

29:44.416 --> 29:47.086
And that just adds
minutes to everything.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.621
I only slept
for an hour last night,

29:49.688 --> 29:51.523
mostly because it was so cold,

29:51.590 --> 29:53.092
woke up shivering

29:53.159 --> 29:54.593
so I just started
biking again.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.694
You guys lost?
MAN: Yeah.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.096
Where are we?

30:30.162 --> 30:31.898
Where did, where did
the Italian boys go?

30:31.964 --> 30:33.265
GOLDBERG: Giorgio is 61.

30:33.332 --> 30:37.769
The, the other
guy, Paolo, is 37

30:37.836 --> 30:40.606
and leads randonne trips.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.841
He was telling me
all kinds of stories
back there, he's cool.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.977
I got them eating
bean burritos now,
they're in trouble.

30:48.380 --> 30:51.483
Did you guys see the
Italians behind us today?
Yeah.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.520
They are desperate.
They've been behind us all
day trying to keep up.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.022
Were they,
were they drafting?

30:56.088 --> 30:57.990
No really, the Italian
men were not laying off.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.858
That's why I've got these
two Italians on my tail.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.860
They are desperate
not to go home like,

31:01.928 --> 31:03.262
having been whipped by me

31:03.329 --> 31:06.132
because, seriously,
Italian men are the worst.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.699
They'll chase you.

31:07.766 --> 31:10.236
When I rode around
the world, I, only wore
one pair of shoes,

31:10.302 --> 31:12.338
the same ones,
all the way
around the world.

31:13.172 --> 31:17.109
I pedaled 144 days.

31:17.176 --> 31:20.246
Um, but, like
the total time

31:20.312 --> 31:23.782
including flights and
stuff was 152 days.

31:26.385 --> 31:30.656
Which for, for not having
cycled ever, wasn't bad.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.707
Come in if you like.
Yeah.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.576
I might even
buy you one.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.344
The guy that fathered me,

31:53.379 --> 31:54.813
he died

31:56.182 --> 31:57.583
77 years old.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.652
And he drank, he smoked.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.789
I'm smoking and
I'm drinking and...

32:03.855 --> 32:04.957
Hi, Mom!

32:05.024 --> 32:06.725
(CHUCKLES)

32:08.394 --> 32:10.796
And I ain't gonna change
my ways for nobody.

32:11.563 --> 32:13.165
It's my life.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.366
Be honest.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.537
Be honest, honest
with yourself.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.407
Don't get no
better than that

32:22.774 --> 32:24.910
and look for gold.

32:24.977 --> 32:27.713
(CHUCKLES)

32:27.779 --> 32:29.948
BUHRING: That really,
really, really tired me out.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.684
(SIGHS) Did not sleep well.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.322
(DEVICE BEEPING)
I hate chirpy morning people,

32:36.388 --> 32:38.690
takes me like two hours
usually to wake up.

32:38.757 --> 32:41.560
Set up my bivvy,
and literally a minute after

32:41.627 --> 32:44.096
I put my sleeping bag in,
a bird shits on it.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.965
I'm like,
"Are you kidding me?"
(LAUGHING)

32:47.033 --> 32:48.900
I'm like it must be
the ghosts around here.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.869
I had a ghost
dream last night.

32:50.936 --> 32:53.672
I don't remember much but
it was a ghost walking by me

32:53.739 --> 32:57.143
and he was disturbing
my sleeping bag.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.566
It was not a good day for me.

33:54.633 --> 33:55.934
And, what else next?

33:56.001 --> 33:58.337
Couple of beers
and bagels would
be all right.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.739
(LAUGHING)

34:00.806 --> 34:03.542
My fiancee now is...

34:04.676 --> 34:06.445
I have to send it
to her because

34:06.512 --> 34:09.880
we always joke about
when we go on road trips,
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

34:09.947 --> 34:12.118
We always get...
Well, I always get an
oatmeal cream pie

34:12.184 --> 34:13.219
and she makes of it.

34:17.656 --> 34:20.159
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

34:26.232 --> 34:28.300
STAUFFER:
I just wanted to cross
the country on my bike

34:28.367 --> 34:31.002
riding bike's okay
but racing? Better, yeah.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.705
Yeah, I wanted to do
"Race Across America"
actually.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.742
It's where I
kind of got into this

34:36.808 --> 34:38.543
and that didn't work
out so this came up

34:38.610 --> 34:40.746
and I was like,
"Yeah, I'm doing this."

34:40.812 --> 34:42.080
Getting chilly now.

34:42.148 --> 34:43.382
MAN: A little bit, huh?

34:43.449 --> 34:45.083
Yeah, it was all right when
I was climbing, but...

34:45.150 --> 34:46.217
Where are you from?

34:46.284 --> 34:48.085
Pennsylvania.
MAN: Cool.

34:48.154 --> 34:51.922
Central Pennsylvania, so
we've got, uh, some mountains
but nothing like this.

34:51.989 --> 34:53.192
Oregon was tough.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.726
Montana was better.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.027
Wyoming is better,
yeah. (CHUCKLES)

34:57.094 --> 34:59.298
STAUFFER: Yeah!
MAN: Big deal.
Getting better and better.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.800
STAUFFER: Oh, yeah!
Getting better all the time.

35:01.867 --> 35:05.003
BILLY RICE: I don't think
I made the best sleep
deprived decision

35:06.037 --> 35:07.373
that I've ever made.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.840
It's slow.

35:08.907 --> 35:11.343
Hopefully, I'll, uh, I'll
be back on the road bike,

35:12.978 --> 35:14.846
maybe, tomorrow
or the next day.

35:15.414 --> 35:16.982
It's okay.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.850
You know, an added
degree of difficulty,

35:18.917 --> 35:21.153
you don't want
this to be too easy,

35:21.220 --> 35:22.554
you know, anybody
could do it.

35:35.201 --> 35:39.538
My biggest issue, last
couple of days, has been
some serious saddle sores.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.308
I, actually, looked down
like two days ago

35:42.374 --> 35:44.576
I had blood running
down my thighs.
MAN: Wow.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.445
It's not a pretty,
pretty picture at all.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.048
PICKUP: Other than that,
it's been beautiful.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.851
(LAUGHING)

RICE: It's so good,
it's so good.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.655
It's good times out here.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.274
BUHRING:
Italians have rolled in.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.143
MAN: Can't shake them.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.481
Cannot shake them.
They don't sleep.

36:55.547 --> 36:59.084
Pedaled all night
to keep up with them.

36:59.150 --> 37:01.186
Between you and me, I think
they are taking something.

37:24.376 --> 37:25.944
I'm doing my best to like keep

37:26.011 --> 37:29.147
to the spirit of race,
and I think the spirit
of the race is to

37:29.214 --> 37:31.917
be out there,
slogging it, you know.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.219
I knew the moment I would
get in the top 10...

37:34.286 --> 37:36.254
(STAMMERS)
The focus would go on like

37:36.322 --> 37:38.490
my, my every single move.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.992
It's fine but, like,
everyone else around me,

37:41.059 --> 37:43.962
there's no focus
on them, like, come on.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.163
How is it fair?

37:45.230 --> 37:46.732
There's always that kind
of people in the world.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.400
There's the watchers,
there's the doers,

37:48.467 --> 37:50.469
and the watchers always
criticize the doers

37:50.536 --> 37:52.704
because the watchers never
would do anything themselves.

37:56.207 --> 37:58.844
Ultimately, I'm in
it for the ride, so,

37:58.910 --> 38:00.779
I don't really care
what people say.

38:04.583 --> 38:05.851
Still going to ride it.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.253
I, I took the tracker
off my, off my phone,

38:08.320 --> 38:10.356
it makes you
obsessive compulsive

38:10.422 --> 38:12.424
and I'm not obsessive,
compulsive at all, man.

38:12.491 --> 38:13.792
You know that.

38:13.859 --> 38:16.294
I just like to ride.

38:16.362 --> 38:18.897
I got to get that
out of my head.

38:18.964 --> 38:22.133
Every one of these races,
some dude gets in my
head and it just bugs me

38:22.200 --> 38:25.136
and then I have to,
like meditate on my...

38:25.203 --> 38:27.373
I put a little mantra on here.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.575
My glove blew off on the pass.

38:29.641 --> 38:33.144
MAN: Oh, no.
(CHUCKLES)
That's okay, I have backups.

38:33.211 --> 38:34.580
GOLDBERG: Oh, today's mantra?

38:34.646 --> 38:38.617
"Everyone suffers,
it's just a matter of degree.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.519
"Just like love
and happiness."

38:40.586 --> 38:41.853
BUHRING: My upbringing

38:41.920 --> 38:46.057
or my life up until
a certain point was,

38:46.124 --> 38:49.260
well, not, not the easiest,
certainly not idealic,

38:49.327 --> 38:51.463
um, environment for
a child to grow up in

38:51.530 --> 38:53.965
and so I did learn a
lot of mental toughness

38:54.032 --> 38:56.234
and independence, um...

38:58.136 --> 39:02.307
And although it was
a pretty rough childhood,

39:02.374 --> 39:04.510
I can honestly say at
this point that I am

39:04.576 --> 39:07.779
grateful for it because
it's turned me
into who I am,

39:07.846 --> 39:10.816
which I know I can count on
myself in the tough times

39:10.882 --> 39:14.219
and it has given
me a certain level
of mental fortitude.

39:15.454 --> 39:18.657
HALL: And, I just think
that it's more about

39:18.724 --> 39:21.560
settling in and getting
comfortable and then just

39:21.627 --> 39:24.430
letting your brain
wander off elsewhere and

39:24.496 --> 39:26.131
you're not going that fast,

39:26.197 --> 39:30.402
you're not going that
lactate threshold type pain.

39:30.469 --> 39:33.605
It's not muscles burning
and teeth clenched and

39:33.672 --> 39:35.841
smashing down
the walls of human,

39:35.907 --> 39:37.576
you know,
adversity and things.

39:37.643 --> 39:39.911
It's riding your
bike and then,

39:39.978 --> 39:43.482
riding a bit more
and then, some more.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.584
(EXHALES) This is quite
tough, actually.

Leave it to sea level
to alert me.

as well starts to get
to my throat after a while.

(COUGHS)

39:56.495 --> 39:58.163

you'll be able to see
where everybody else is

just look behind you.

you know, today
is Father's Day.

40:37.035 --> 40:38.470
I... (CHUCKLES)

40:38.537 --> 40:39.938
I was going to
say that to you,

40:40.005 --> 40:42.007

were... (CHUCKLES)

40:42.073 --> 40:43.609
That's so awesome!

40:48.246 --> 40:49.881
So, Happy Father's Day!

40:49.948 --> 40:51.449

speaking of which.

probably get on the road.

can get back to me.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.436
I had a plan to stop
in Florence last night

41:11.503 --> 41:12.838
so, regardless of

41:12.904 --> 41:14.740
where I was, early or
late, I was stopping

41:14.806 --> 41:16.141
at the Super 8 in Florence

I had mailed some stuff
there ahead of time.

So, my half way is...
I had a chain if I
needed a chain, tires.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.849
I like Kansas.
MAN: Yeah.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.717
I'm like one of the few.

the last two years,

41:28.419 --> 41:30.055
we get there and
I loved Kansas.

41:30.121 --> 41:33.058
Like, you get a
lot of crosswind,

41:33.124 --> 41:35.093
'cause you typically
get a crosswind

41:35.160 --> 41:38.229
from the... Usually from
the north and then, it
switches to the south.

all over again.

That bicyclist
coming through here,

42:24.375 --> 42:25.944
usually by the time
we see him, it's

42:26.011 --> 42:28.814
30, 40 days into their
trip from coast to coast.
Yeah.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.682
This gentlemen's following
your group that left

42:30.749 --> 42:32.317
Oregon eight days ago.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.786
They're averaging
300 miles a day
on the bicycles.

42:34.853 --> 42:36.254
Oh, crap!
(LAUGHING)

42:36.321 --> 42:37.689
I think that's
something you
ought to try

42:37.756 --> 42:39.791
before harvest,
next year.
Nope!

42:39.858 --> 42:42.227
MAN: Mike's in about
a 120 miles ahead

42:42.293 --> 42:44.095
of the next guy.
WOMAN: Oh, my goodness!

42:44.162 --> 42:46.564
At times, it's had a
little bit of a tail to it.
(WIND WHOOSHING)

42:46.632 --> 42:49.167
That winds been nice
on the way in but

42:49.234 --> 42:51.937
now, it's a 90 degree
turn straight into it.

42:52.003 --> 42:53.605
MAN: Yeah.

42:53.672 --> 42:55.874
We're looking
for nearly 10
miles an hour.

42:55.941 --> 42:57.709
This is an average day.
(WIND WHOOSING)

42:57.776 --> 43:00.111
Windy is when it gets up
above 90 miles an hour

43:00.178 --> 43:02.080
and I have to bend over
to come out the door.

43:02.147 --> 43:04.950
I don't envy the bikers
at all in this wind.

43:05.016 --> 43:07.418
They're already fighting it,
then there's no wind
and then you

43:07.485 --> 43:08.887
get sucked in with the truck.

43:08.954 --> 43:10.555
It's gets pretty nasty.

43:14.259 --> 43:16.294
The Italians are really
pursuing me today.

43:16.361 --> 43:18.630
MAN: Yeah?
They got on your tail again.

43:18.697 --> 43:22.634
They're hauling ass.
They've been cycling
since 11:00 last night.

43:22.701 --> 43:26.004
That's how desperate they
are not to let me get ahead.

43:26.071 --> 43:29.274
But, it's fine I, only, slept
for three hours last night.

43:29.340 --> 43:31.810
I want to get over
and finished with
the mountains so I can

43:32.644 --> 43:34.145
speed along tomorrow.

43:34.212 --> 43:35.546
My bike's screw's broken,

43:35.613 --> 43:37.482
so my seat has been going
down and lower and lower,

43:37.548 --> 43:39.350
so, now my knees
are killing me.

43:39.417 --> 43:42.721
Damn Italians have arrived.

43:42.788 --> 43:43.989
I must run.

43:46.091 --> 43:48.426
Seriously, when are
the guys gonna sleep?

44:07.145 --> 44:08.346
LANE: Started looking
at the maps and like

44:08.413 --> 44:10.648
I don't have enough
stuff to drink.

44:10.716 --> 44:13.351
Started rationing
on the way down here to...

44:13.418 --> 44:15.620
Every mile I was allowed
one little gulp of water

44:15.687 --> 44:19.024
just in case there's
nothing here, I mean, I
was going to start to find

44:19.090 --> 44:22.393
somebody's house which
got a water spigot on
the outside or something

44:22.460 --> 44:26.264
but there's this thing
here which I assume
is okay to drink.

44:26.331 --> 44:29.200
MAN: Yeah.
LANE: I tell you, if I was
going to do this again...

44:29.267 --> 44:30.902
MAN: Yeah.

44:30.969 --> 44:35.406
...I will probably rethink
my Spiz diet.

44:35.473 --> 44:37.542
All of that is
Spiz right now.

44:37.608 --> 44:39.277
MAN: Whoa.
So, you take...

44:39.344 --> 44:41.780
And it's heavy. So, you
take this and this out...
MAN: Yep.

44:41.847 --> 44:43.248
You don't need
anything upfront,

44:44.549 --> 44:48.119
and there's another thing
of Spiz in my backpack

44:48.186 --> 44:50.355
and without the Spiz that
means that the water bottles

44:50.421 --> 44:52.057
aren't full of Spiz,
they're full of water.

44:57.028 --> 44:58.997
BUHRING: Is that it?

44:59.064 --> 45:00.899
Make it harder.

45:00.966 --> 45:02.768
(CHUCKLES)
(MAN CHUCKLES)

45:03.701 --> 45:04.870
(EXHALES)

45:04.936 --> 45:08.073
Why do we climb
mountains? Downhill!

45:37.668 --> 45:39.504
Best downhill ever.

45:55.720 --> 45:58.089
MAN: (SHOUTING)
Come on, Mike.

45:58.156 --> 45:59.991
We've got chocolate milk.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.328
You're here.

46:07.565 --> 46:09.167
You have no
special favors.

46:09.234 --> 46:12.370
All 43 of you are going to
get food when they get here,

46:12.437 --> 46:15.106
and whatever you
need. This is cool.

46:16.808 --> 46:18.910
Here, you don't expect
bike shops to do

46:18.977 --> 46:20.445
amazing things
like this, do you?

46:20.511 --> 46:22.480
We're not a normal bike shop
though, we never have been.

46:22.547 --> 46:25.350
We didn't start that
way and we won't
finish that way, so...

46:25.416 --> 46:26.952
No, this is a
very cool set up.

46:27.819 --> 46:30.455
That head wind was a side wind

46:30.521 --> 46:33.391
and there were just
big trucks like that.

46:33.458 --> 46:35.126
They were all just getting
really close

46:35.193 --> 46:36.661
and they had horns
on them and stuff
like that and I'm...

46:38.296 --> 46:41.266
I was about 45 degrees,
trying to keep straight.

46:41.332 --> 46:42.834
It was ridiculous.

46:46.437 --> 46:49.140
Got another 2100 and
some change to go!

46:49.207 --> 46:51.042
Thank you!
Thank you, man and
have a safe trip.

46:51.109 --> 46:53.244
Yup. Cheers! I'll be back
I'm sure.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.315
BUHRING: Cycling into
the night, I love it,

46:57.382 --> 47:00.151
I love the silence,
I love the darkness
and just

47:00.218 --> 47:03.054
being alone

47:03.121 --> 47:05.023
and the peace that you feel.

47:06.291 --> 47:10.095
It's freezing cold and
a really bad wind but

47:10.161 --> 47:13.598
just laying out and
watching the stars,

47:13.664 --> 47:15.633
I don't think I'd rather be
anywhere else right now.

47:21.706 --> 47:23.241
(WIND WHOOSHING)

47:24.575 --> 47:26.677
WOMAN: How is
the wind out there?

47:26.744 --> 47:29.114
MAN: Better than
yesterday-ish.

47:29.180 --> 47:30.882
WOMAN: Is it more
favorable today?

47:30.949 --> 47:33.851
MAN: Um, it's about the
same sort of crosswind

47:33.919 --> 47:35.320
it's just a little section

47:35.386 --> 47:36.821
where you have
to head directly into it.

47:36.888 --> 47:38.356
WOMAN: Mmm-hmm
MAN: It don't seem as...

47:38.423 --> 47:39.624
WOMAN: As bad. Okay.

47:39.690 --> 47:41.059
MAN: But still not good.
WOMAN: Yeah.

47:41.126 --> 47:43.461
He, actually, did say that
if there was hamburger here,

47:43.528 --> 47:45.931
you might drop your
liquid diet for a minute.

47:45.997 --> 47:47.698
(ALL LAUGHING)

47:47.765 --> 47:50.368
MAN: So, does
the food taste good?
It's pretty good.

47:50.435 --> 47:52.537
MAN: Yeah.
Yeah, it hits the spot.

47:52.603 --> 47:54.105
You're not considering
that you are probably

47:54.172 --> 47:57.575
eat the rear end out of
a rhinoceros right now,

47:57.642 --> 47:59.844
hamburgers are
probably pretty good.

47:59.911 --> 48:02.347
MAN: God speed, Jason.
Farewell, brother.

48:02.413 --> 48:03.681
We happen to be one of

48:03.748 --> 48:05.716
very few towns that the

48:05.783 --> 48:09.154
Trans-Am cyclists
that use the
Trans-American trail

48:09.220 --> 48:10.488
uh, get to come right down

48:10.555 --> 48:11.990
in the middle of
our main street.

48:12.057 --> 48:14.659
So, our mission here, at
Newton Bike Shop is to

48:14.725 --> 48:16.527
make sure that
everybody can bike.

48:16.594 --> 48:18.029
It's not about your bicycle,

48:18.096 --> 48:20.565
we don't care that you got
it from a department store,

48:20.631 --> 48:24.135
42% of people in America
get their bikes from
department stores,

48:24.202 --> 48:25.870
so why wouldn't
we fix those.

48:28.306 --> 48:31.009
Look what's here? (CHUCKLES)

48:31.076 --> 48:35.646
So, the plan is just to
get this together, eat.

48:35.713 --> 48:39.317
Um, you know, you
reach a point

48:39.384 --> 48:42.753
in these races
where that whole, like
four hours of sleep

48:42.820 --> 48:45.723
and eating on the go and
like that, all falls apart.

48:45.790 --> 48:47.292
So, I got hit by
a horse trailer.

48:47.358 --> 48:50.628
I saw the truck pass me
and then, he tried to like

48:51.529 --> 48:52.897
scooch over to the right

48:52.964 --> 48:55.866
and he clipped at me with
like the back of the trailer

48:55.933 --> 48:59.070
you know, it had like
a little, uh, like a
lip that came out,

48:59.137 --> 49:01.506
and he... It just...
I was in my aero bars

49:01.572 --> 49:04.042
but he hit, he hit this

49:04.109 --> 49:06.911
which just spun everything
sideways, over I went.

49:06.978 --> 49:10.015
It's going to feel
good though, to be
back on this road bike.

49:10.081 --> 49:12.750
Have to relearn
to ride this thing.

49:12.817 --> 49:14.986
(WOMAN CHEERING)

49:15.053 --> 49:18.056
He's back on his race
machine, he'll start
picking people off.

49:18.123 --> 49:20.758
It will be really
fun to watch, so,

49:20.825 --> 49:22.827
he's not done yet.
He's still got more to go.

49:33.571 --> 49:35.640
MAN: So, my daughter and
I did that last night

49:35.706 --> 49:37.108
and put it up last night

49:37.808 --> 49:39.344
to give them something.

49:39.410 --> 49:40.878
MAN: That's awesome.
It's a long ride.

49:40.945 --> 49:43.248
PICKUP: The wind is killing me
the last couple of days.

49:43.314 --> 49:44.949
(SNIFFS)

49:45.016 --> 49:47.318
It's the third time
now I've ridden
across the Plains,

49:47.385 --> 49:48.819
I am never doing it again.

49:48.886 --> 49:50.955
When I, when I fell asleep,
I didn't really realize

49:51.022 --> 49:53.458
it was just completely
infested with mosquitos.

49:53.524 --> 49:56.827
I woke up like 4:00
this morning completely

49:56.894 --> 49:58.963
bitten to hell with it.

49:59.030 --> 50:02.133
Yeah, it's hot,
it's windy, it's tough.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.469
Pueblo is like the,
uh, the half-way point

50:04.535 --> 50:06.137
and you kind of,
mentally think,

50:06.204 --> 50:08.406
"Yeah, I've cracked
it, this is awesome."

50:08.473 --> 50:10.308
I've got some
flats coming up.

50:10.375 --> 50:11.376
You know, you've
probably got some
knee issues and some

50:11.442 --> 50:12.943
tendon issues after
the mountains,

50:13.010 --> 50:15.213
then you hit the flats
and it's just like,

50:16.181 --> 50:17.848
"This is so much worse."

50:38.103 --> 50:39.870
The daily mileage
just isn't, uh...

50:41.606 --> 50:44.075
I just underestimated
the amount of time...

50:44.142 --> 50:48.079
Especially, I am not a
fast-acting person,
obviously, to stand here,

50:48.146 --> 50:51.516
going into stores and
getting your supplies
and everything just

50:51.582 --> 50:53.017
takes way more
time than you think.

50:55.052 --> 50:58.022
Yeah, you can almost start
to like, think about it.

50:58.089 --> 51:01.926
It's only Missouri and then,
cross the river, and Illinois,

51:01.992 --> 51:04.495
you'd only be the
little, tiny part of it.

51:04.562 --> 51:06.464
Cross that river and
then you've got what
a couple of days

51:06.531 --> 51:08.699
to cross Kentucky and then
you're basically in Virginia,

51:08.766 --> 51:10.535
just go up and over the ridge.

51:10.601 --> 51:11.769
Doesn't sound too bad.

51:16.974 --> 51:19.310
Need a little massage
right now, a little massage

51:19.377 --> 51:21.812
and, oh, I need
a massage on my

51:21.879 --> 51:23.914
uh, saddle sores,
it feels fantastic.

51:23.981 --> 51:25.983
This feels good, right here,
all this, right here.

51:26.050 --> 51:27.718
Awesome. It was
kind of defeating,

51:27.785 --> 51:29.320
watching all those
blue dots pull away

51:29.387 --> 51:31.189
when you check it out
and you're like, "Okay",

51:31.256 --> 51:32.957
and then it just
kind of settles in

51:33.023 --> 51:35.092
that you got to realize you
got to run your own race

51:35.160 --> 51:36.827
and it's between me and me

51:36.894 --> 51:38.296
you know, me
and my thoughts.

51:38.363 --> 51:40.898
Me, how far I
can push myself

51:40.965 --> 51:43.701
and, um, I don't think I've
really reached that yet.

51:43.768 --> 51:47.037
I've gone through
a lot of pain and
suffering out here but,

51:47.104 --> 51:49.674
it's gotten...
Just cold, cold.

51:51.909 --> 51:53.678
He's got a real
light shirt on

51:53.744 --> 51:55.680
right in the middle
of the road. The crest.

51:55.746 --> 51:57.848
The middle of the road!

51:57.915 --> 51:59.917
Actually, to
the far end left.

51:59.984 --> 52:01.586
As we see him,
you can't see him?

52:01.652 --> 52:03.154
He's coming down the road.

52:03.221 --> 52:04.855
No.

52:04.922 --> 52:07.525
I see a little reflection.
He's almost a
yellow shirt now.

52:07.592 --> 52:09.860
You're looking like
five miles out there.

52:09.927 --> 52:11.596
No, it's less
than a mile now.

52:14.199 --> 52:16.534
White truck
coming down...
Yeah.

52:16.601 --> 52:19.504
Double the distance, he's
on the left hand side.
That's him.

52:19.570 --> 52:20.905
Like a little reflection.

52:20.971 --> 52:22.507
A little reflection.

52:22.573 --> 52:24.242
See him now?

52:24.309 --> 52:27.278
He's just crossing the...
You can't see the
color of his shirt?

52:27.345 --> 52:29.980
Yes, I can it's either...
It's a white shirt.

52:32.116 --> 52:35.152
Actually, I think
his light was the
cause of the reflection.

52:35.220 --> 52:38.889
That's... I saw the
headlights, what I could see.

52:38.956 --> 52:40.958
Look up and wave.

52:41.025 --> 52:43.027
Hey! I'll buy you dinner

52:43.093 --> 52:44.329
if you want to stop.

52:44.395 --> 52:46.130
STEELE: Have the other guys
already gone through?

52:46.197 --> 52:48.132
There is one guy
that went through.

52:48.199 --> 52:50.401
Who's that guy?

52:50.468 --> 52:52.303
I can't turn down
the free dinner, right?

52:52.370 --> 52:54.972
That's right.
Come on, come on!
I'll buy you dinner.

52:55.039 --> 52:56.407
I want dinner.

52:56.474 --> 52:57.608
I know.

52:57.675 --> 52:58.843
I'd be happy to...
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

52:59.677 --> 53:00.978
All right.

53:02.380 --> 53:03.981
And then, he told me...

53:04.048 --> 53:05.250
Your sandwich.

53:05.316 --> 53:06.984
Yes, I will pack all that,
just give me a second.

53:07.985 --> 53:09.119
You need cash, brother?

53:09.186 --> 53:10.288
No, no, I'm good.

53:13.691 --> 53:15.960
That's better.
(LAUGHS)

53:16.026 --> 53:17.428
Russell and Dave,

53:18.396 --> 53:19.630
those guys were so awesome.

53:28.306 --> 53:31.742
HALL: It's Portsville down...

53:31.809 --> 53:33.077
(CLICKS TONGUE)

53:33.878 --> 53:35.780
Town on the rivers

53:35.846 --> 53:37.348
on creek crossings...

53:38.683 --> 53:40.385
(SIGHS)

53:40.451 --> 53:43.321
It's good to get that
out of the way with
that in the night.

53:43.388 --> 53:47.425
It's just everything
in this. It just hounds
you all the time from...

53:47.492 --> 53:50.227
You know, you started out
there and you're into mucky,

53:51.161 --> 53:53.298
like, saw-teeth
climbs like this.

53:53.364 --> 53:58.703
Seventy miles in, in 4000
is not a huge gap.

53:58.769 --> 54:02.273
I just need to make
sure I don't make too
many mistakes and

54:03.007 --> 54:05.142
and just keep moving.

54:05.209 --> 54:07.345
I can see he's not
stopping that often

54:07.412 --> 54:09.046
and I might be riding
a little bit quicker

54:09.113 --> 54:13.818
but, um, I tend to stop more
often and eat and stuff,

54:13.884 --> 54:15.920
so he catches up.

54:15.986 --> 54:17.322
I better get finished tonight.

54:31.502 --> 54:33.671
Oh, you've got to
be kidding me. What are
you guys doing here?

54:33.738 --> 54:35.105
MAN: What
are you doing here?

54:35.172 --> 54:36.707
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

54:36.774 --> 54:39.109
This is, this
is a tough ride.
Yeah?

54:39.176 --> 54:41.245
There's nobody else
saying? Everybody else
saying it's easy?

54:41.312 --> 54:44.048
MAN: (CHUCKLES) No.
(LAUGHS)

54:44.114 --> 54:46.651
Or, am I just the only one
hallucinating out here?
(CHUCKLES)

54:46.717 --> 54:48.152
On a daily basis,

54:48.218 --> 54:50.721
the conversations I have
with the cows are incredible.

54:50.788 --> 54:52.256
My mantra for today is,

54:52.323 --> 54:56.126
"Believe in the innate
kindness and compassion
of all living beings",

54:56.193 --> 54:58.929
because all I found that
in the state of Kansas

54:58.996 --> 55:00.965
is people who
care about you.

55:01.031 --> 55:02.833
The first night,

55:02.900 --> 55:06.737
I, I fought that
wind for eight hours
to go 65 miles.

55:06.804 --> 55:08.639
It took me eight miles an hour

55:08.706 --> 55:12.610
I got to the town,
the guy gave me a hotel room

55:12.677 --> 55:14.011
and the lady kept
the restaurant open

55:14.078 --> 55:16.514
even though it was closed.
Made me a steak dinner.

55:21.218 --> 55:23.921
I woke up before
my alarm this morning
which is a bit odd.

55:25.890 --> 55:28.459
Seems like I only
slept for four hours.

55:28.526 --> 55:31.061
I have not really
got a goal in mind

55:31.128 --> 55:32.763
'cause I don't know
what day it is.

55:32.830 --> 55:35.766
So, I really do not
know that day it is,

55:35.833 --> 55:39.236
I think it might be
Thursday, but I don't know.

55:40.371 --> 55:42.039
You can't take
yourself too seriously

55:42.106 --> 55:45.376
it's only riding bikes
at the end of the day.

55:45.443 --> 55:47.378
You're not curing
cancer or anything.

56:44.702 --> 56:47.972
(GROANS)
Well, I got here maybe about

56:49.139 --> 56:50.608
12:30 last night.

56:50.675 --> 56:53.143
(SNIFFS) And, uh...

56:54.278 --> 56:56.547
Hey, I forgot there
was a ferry.

56:56.614 --> 56:58.783
Quite a lot of bugs
there so...

56:59.750 --> 57:02.152
They were trying to bite me.

57:02.219 --> 57:03.921
But other than that...

57:03.988 --> 57:07.224
I had a decent few hours
of sleep in the end.

57:07.291 --> 57:09.960
Ah, it starts at 6:00 in
the morning. (SNIFFS)

57:10.027 --> 57:11.862
So the first one's...

57:11.929 --> 57:13.731
We've just missed I think.

57:18.569 --> 57:20.571
I am ready for
my breakfast.

57:20.638 --> 57:22.339
(METAL CLANKS)

57:26.777 --> 57:31.348
And, I remember, um,
looking at it on
the map and...

57:31.415 --> 57:33.383
Rings a bell there
was ferry ride but...

57:35.019 --> 57:36.286
That's the last
bit of paper now.

57:36.353 --> 57:39.023
They're just
significant towns.

57:40.324 --> 57:41.792
So it's a breeze.

57:42.459 --> 57:43.528
3189.

59:10.948 --> 59:14.685
Oh, I don't know. I must've
been saying for
the past two days that,

59:14.752 --> 59:16.754
"Oh, just three or
four more days."

59:16.821 --> 59:20.758
And it always seems that,
that same distance away.

59:20.825 --> 59:23.628
I always thought it will
be 16 or less, but...

59:25.229 --> 59:27.397
We weren't, we weren't
really racing at the start,

59:27.464 --> 59:29.800
I mean we didn't pace
ourselves too much.

59:29.867 --> 59:31.335
I think it's just that, that

59:31.401 --> 59:33.638
little bit longer
that you go out hard

59:33.704 --> 59:35.906
like that and
then you just

59:35.973 --> 59:38.108
blow yourself up
a little bit, I think.

59:38.743 --> 59:41.478
MAN: Day what? 10?

59:41.545 --> 59:44.281
Oh, no, dude, it's like 15
or something like that.

59:44.348 --> 59:46.751
We just saw
Jesse and Juliana,

59:46.817 --> 59:49.687
the Italians got by them,

59:49.754 --> 59:52.957
uh, just as they
were waking up

59:53.023 --> 59:56.861
and I know Juliana
is super motivated

59:56.927 --> 01:00:00.597
to uh, to not let
the Italians stay
in front of her.

01:00:00.665 --> 01:00:03.233
Yeah, Italians passed.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.302
At least we slept good,
they didn't.

01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:07.872
The other guys are behind us.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.342
How far?

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.945
MAN: Don't know.

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:25.656
STAUFFER: I've said, "Hi."
"Hi and Bye!"

01:00:29.694 --> 01:00:32.362
I just asked them
how they were doing and
everything, you know.

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:34.732
That's the first
time I've seen them
on the road.

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.967
(BARKING)

01:00:46.711 --> 01:00:48.913
Are they close?

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.748
Did you see them?
MAN: Yeah.

01:00:53.718 --> 01:00:55.119
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:04.428
Hasta la vista, baby!

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:08.899
That was awesome.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.903
Nothing like a little
early morning racing.

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:20.711
BUHRING: One of the Italians
just rode up next to me
after I passed them

01:01:20.778 --> 01:01:24.114
and basically accused me of
cheating to get this far.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:29.119
He said that it's impossible
that, um, I've beaten him

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:31.388
after cycling just
two and a half years

01:01:31.455 --> 01:01:35.059
and he has been racing his
whole life and it's impossible
that I am faster than him

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:36.927
so, therefore,
I must be cheating.

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:38.628
And, I said
"Really, how can we cheat?"

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.164
He said,
"You have a camper van.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:41.966
"I know you have
a camper van following you."

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.901
(CHUCKLES) I was so angry.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:48.873
She just graduated
from nursing school

01:01:48.939 --> 01:01:50.908
got a job right out.

01:01:50.975 --> 01:01:54.979
I just got a new job.
We just sold and bought
a new house.

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.047
Now she's pregnant.

01:01:57.114 --> 01:01:59.016
It's like everything
is just kind of all
happening at once, so...

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.419
It's all overwhelming but

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:06.656
extremely exciting too, so...

01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:10.060
Part of me was like,
I just want to go home

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:14.631
after like she told me,
but, I'm like "I got to go
finish at least."

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:16.834
My hand doesn't
function so I have to

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:21.505
shift with my
other hand.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.173
MAN: What happened?
I don't know.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.076
I think it's just from
the pressure of being
on my hands all day.

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:29.113
There's just
no strength in it.

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:33.818
Kinda looked like
he was little bit wore out.

01:02:33.884 --> 01:02:36.253
(LAUGHS) He still looks
kind of wore out.

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:40.390
The sun, you know,
takes a lot out of people.

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:43.327
'Cause I know, I walk
every day, five, 10 miles.

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:45.295
I've done walk
five miles this morning

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:47.197
and I'll walk
back home.
MAN: Good.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.866
Yeah! I'll walk up here.

01:02:48.933 --> 01:02:52.036
People say, you know,
wonder why, I say,
"Well, I'm 67."

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:54.438
You know, I want
to keep my health.

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:55.906
I had this thing
already mapped out

01:02:55.973 --> 01:02:57.842
that I knew it was on
the race route, so, I just

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.113
figured, well,

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.915
I might as well just
stay up and ride and

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:10.921
grab an afternoon nap
in the sun instead of,
uh, sleeping in the wet.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:19.763
Y'all going
cross country?

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:21.331
Well, it should be
done Tuesday.
How far?

01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:23.667
And, how far you got?

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:26.603
Huh, we've got
about 850 miles...

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:31.976
A little over 800 miles
left, we have done
3500 in two weeks.

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:33.243
Damn!

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.879
I just sit on this
thing all day.

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:36.713
Well, good luck!

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.382
Thanks guys.
Good luck.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:06.443
I've got my emergency
ration of bagels and Nutella

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.014
which I'll probably
and may be have before
bed or for breakfast.

01:04:11.815 --> 01:04:13.583
Pretty nice, little lifestyle.

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:16.353
You know, the whole trying
to be an athlete,

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:21.191
training all the time,

01:04:21.258 --> 01:04:24.828
you know, pretending you're
not really a grown up and
just pretty much fun,

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:27.731
like everything about it.

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:29.233
Traveling real far places,

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:32.002
like going all
over the world and
doing crazy stuff.

01:04:34.104 --> 01:04:36.173
Watching Eco-Challenge
when I was a little kid,

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.342
being like, "That is awesome."

01:04:38.408 --> 01:04:40.310
Guys running
through the forest.

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:47.284
Ours is a coal mine place
but it ain't much anymore.

01:04:47.351 --> 01:04:50.154
The way things are going,
you know what I mean.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.056
Uh, I wish things would
pick up.

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:53.723
Wouldn't be...
Wouldn't be having
a yard sale,

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:55.459
you know what
I mean. (CHUCKLES)

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:57.061
Trying to pay the bills.

01:04:57.127 --> 01:04:58.862
I talked to one
dude, he's like,

01:04:58.929 --> 01:05:00.931
his first time he ever
done a cross country,

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:04.201
and he said...

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:05.569
But when he got here

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.271
and got these
mountains and he said,

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:08.838
"This is my last time
I ever doing it",

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.540
he said "I'll never do
those trails again."

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:13.643
Nothing but mountains,
nothing but curves,
steep curves too.

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:15.312
I don't see how
they do it, man.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:21.085
HALL: Oh, that last bit of
road down was hectic.

01:05:22.086 --> 01:05:24.188
Just weary.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:25.990
It just doesn't seem to end.

01:05:27.191 --> 01:05:29.626
I just want to get done.

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:32.262
Just start eating
everything in sight.

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:38.068
STAUFFER: Ice cream.
I love ice cream.

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:41.005
BUHRING: I, actually, tried
putting on weight before
I came out

01:05:41.071 --> 01:05:43.073
because I knew I
would lose weight.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.809
WOMAN: I've heard of
crazy people like that?

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:48.278
Define "crazy."

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:50.914
I think that's
entirely subjective.

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:56.686
I think crazy is sitting
behind a desk from
9:00 to 5:00.

01:05:56.753 --> 01:05:59.489
WOMAN: I am sorry.
MAN: It's okay.

01:05:59.556 --> 01:06:02.159
WOMAN: Here, I don't know
anything about you guys

01:06:02.226 --> 01:06:04.228
but I know you
have to have food,

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:06.230
and I want you
to have that.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:09.466
Oh, thank you.
You are such an angel.
Thank you so much.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.634
Yeah! Whoo!

01:06:58.148 --> 01:07:00.717
HALL: Yeah, I'm starting
to feel a bit spaced out now.

01:07:05.289 --> 01:07:09.593
My hand won't
do certain things.

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:12.529
We were half way with

01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:15.565
all the mountains done

01:07:18.001 --> 01:07:20.504
in seven days,
seven and a half days.

01:07:23.673 --> 01:07:27.177
I don't think you can
suggest that the
last part is easier.

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:32.949
Someone asked me about the
"Round the world" race.

01:07:33.617 --> 01:07:36.052
I said to him,

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.656
"You know, when you...
When you want to do
it again and enjoy it,

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:44.128
"but if you enjoy racing,
then it's what you enjoy.

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:49.466
"Going slowly isn't
necessarily more enjoyable."

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:56.906

01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:49.952
Does it feel... Does it feel
real to you, yet?

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:54.257
I've been kind
of in my own...

01:24:54.323 --> 01:24:57.393
Real world,
not real world
place, so...

01:25:09.138 --> 01:25:10.539
An alien?

01:25:14.977 --> 01:25:16.379
Yea, I know
what you mean.

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:26.722
MURARI: Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:28.824
LAURETI: Yeah.

01:25:47.443 --> 01:25:50.946
MAN: It was really hard.
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:25:51.747 --> 01:25:52.948
Exhausting.

01:25:57.853 --> 01:25:59.722
WOMAN: No, you're good,
Nathan, you can stay
in the picture!

01:26:00.323 --> 01:26:01.657
Say "Cheese!"

01:26:01.724 --> 01:26:02.658
(CAMERA CLICKING)
