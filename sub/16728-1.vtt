00:27.313 --> 00:29.637
She sings from somewhere
you can't see

00:29.662 --> 00:31.250
She sits in the top...

00:31.275 --> 00:32.711
...of the greenest tree

00:32.735 --> 00:35.522
She sends out an aroma
of undefined love

00:35.547 --> 00:37.877
It drips on down
in a mist from above

00:37.902 --> 00:40.357
She's just the girl,
she's just the girl

00:40.382 --> 00:42.227
The girl U want...

00:42.854 --> 00:44.729
- Oi! Stop!
- She's just the girl

00:44.802 --> 00:46.896
She's just the girl
The girl U want...

00:46.921 --> 00:48.517
Oh, bloody hell.

00:50.596 --> 00:51.893
Oh!

00:52.128 --> 00:54.589
<i>In the interests of passenger safety,</i>

00:54.614 --> 00:56.637
<i>please refrain
from running on the platforms</i>

00:56.662 --> 00:58.157
<i>or in the station area.</i>

00:58.182 --> 01:01.816
Dale! Don't let Sasha
check her email, phone or computer.

01:01.841 --> 01:04.417
- Create a crisis if you have to.
- Got it.

01:04.441 --> 01:06.237
She's just the girl
The girl U want...

01:06.262 --> 01:08.587
Have you received
a software update on your phone?

01:08.662 --> 01:10.317
- No.
- Good. Don't touch it.

01:10.342 --> 01:12.094
It's got a bug that will crash
the whole system.

01:12.119 --> 01:14.357
She's just the girl,
she's just the girl

01:14.382 --> 01:16.798
The girl U want

01:17.382 --> 01:20.197
She's just the girl,
she's just the girl

01:20.222 --> 01:22.001
The girl U want...

01:22.582 --> 01:25.726
- Nooo!
- I need your iPad too.

01:25.751 --> 01:28.717
- The girl U want...
- Ugh!

01:28.742 --> 01:31.379
She's just the girl,
she's just the girl...

01:35.605 --> 01:39.320
All over the world, there is
one very common theme, and...

01:39.867 --> 01:42.734
- Did you just get home?
- God, I stink.

01:43.585 --> 01:44.871
And yet I like it.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.388
- Do you want to smell me?
- No.

01:46.742 --> 01:47.966
How do I look?

01:48.653 --> 01:50.058
What look are you going for?

01:50.183 --> 01:53.157
Is it CEO of a paper supply firm
or waiter?

01:53.182 --> 01:54.550
What do you think?

01:59.702 --> 02:02.917
I got the moves when you
see me on a Saturday night

02:02.942 --> 02:05.777
I got the moves, jukebox playing
and the music's alright

02:05.802 --> 02:08.015
I got the moves
Hey, hey, I think I do...

02:08.041 --> 02:09.317
Done.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.346
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

02:16.802 --> 02:18.277
I got the moves

02:18.302 --> 02:20.277
Hey, hey, I think I do...

02:20.302 --> 02:22.533
- Good morning, Paula.
- Morning, Lily.

02:22.582 --> 02:25.108
- How are you, Rex?
- Morning, Lily.

02:25.782 --> 02:27.349
You take my hand Shimmy, shimmy

02:27.374 --> 02:29.163
Now he's holding me tight...

02:29.822 --> 02:31.237
- Hey, Lily.
- Val.

02:31.262 --> 02:32.735
Morning.

02:33.742 --> 02:35.188
Morning, Lily.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.197
It's not news.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.957
She has 60 million Instagram followers.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.677
Anything Taylor says is news.

02:41.702 --> 02:44.905
You can't judge newsworthy moments
from the number of likes.

02:44.930 --> 02:46.485
How else are you supposed to judge them?

02:46.510 --> 02:48.197
OK, you guys know the drill.

02:48.222 --> 02:50.717
New segments need to have
some degree of longevity,

02:50.858 --> 02:52.932
something you can put
a spin on each week.

02:52.957 --> 02:55.169
- A feature-length political story?
- That's a good idea.

02:55.194 --> 02:56.796
In addition to our regular news updates?

02:56.822 --> 02:58.237
- Yes, in addition.
- No.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.837
No surprise there. Good luck.

02:59.862 --> 03:01.837
We want something bigger,
something more interactive.

03:01.862 --> 03:05.183
Lily, clearly you've been
preparing something.

03:05.542 --> 03:07.834
Do you know who does
most of the world's work?

03:08.102 --> 03:10.333
- Indians.
- Google. No, Facebook.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.237
No. Women.

03:12.569 --> 03:15.299
Women do 66% of the world's work.

03:15.324 --> 03:17.677
Even at Google, 'cause I'm
pretty sure that's mainly men.

03:17.702 --> 03:21.317
It's not about Google or Facebook,
it's about women around the world

03:21.342 --> 03:23.557
and the amount
of actual physical work they do.

03:23.593 --> 03:25.904
So I'm thinking we look
at women around the world

03:25.929 --> 03:27.871
and compare them on a number of indices,

03:27.896 --> 03:32.277
including how much work they do,
what they eat, what they buy.

03:32.302 --> 03:35.118
It'll be fast.
Bang! This is how much I earn.

03:35.306 --> 03:38.237
Bang! This is what I eat.
Bang! This is who I live with.

03:38.262 --> 03:39.797
Bang! This is depressing.

03:39.822 --> 03:41.232
So you think if we do a different
country each week?

03:41.257 --> 03:43.177
And we could compare them
to Australian women.

03:43.202 --> 03:44.670
Could we bring in a beauty component,

03:44.695 --> 03:46.477
perhaps looking at different
cultural views of beauty?

03:46.502 --> 03:48.417
- We can do that.
- Or make-up.

03:48.442 --> 03:50.492
And how different cultures
use make-up differently.

03:50.517 --> 03:51.717
I like that.

03:51.742 --> 03:53.957
I wouldn't want the focus
to be beauty or make-up.

03:53.982 --> 03:55.597
It's more about power and work.

03:55.622 --> 03:57.117
You got any sponsors interested?

03:57.142 --> 03:58.917
I've spoken to a couple
of Australian fashion labels

03:58.942 --> 04:00.266
and they love the idea.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.838
How interested?
Will they put money on the table?

04:02.863 --> 04:04.863
Not immediately.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.550
Right.

04:06.575 --> 04:10.192
Um, let's see what else we have.

04:10.626 --> 04:13.917
- Nikkii?
- This guy.

04:13.942 --> 04:15.597
Jack Winters.

04:15.622 --> 04:18.416
A chef. Cooks simple, honest food.

04:18.442 --> 04:21.046
He says "Man Tong Noodles" twice,
we have a sponsor on board.

04:21.071 --> 04:23.557
The segment pays for itself.
Boom! Slam dunk.

04:23.747 --> 04:28.158
Totally hot, totally manly,
just opened a new restaurant.

04:28.183 --> 04:30.237
Is he interested
in being on network television?

04:30.262 --> 04:31.797
Well, I've put out a few feelers

04:31.822 --> 04:35.082
and the answer is a resounding
"Yes, please!"

04:36.682 --> 04:38.557
Lily, I'd like you to work with Nikkii.

04:38.582 --> 04:40.357
Help her get this over the line.

04:40.382 --> 04:43.162
I'll have a talk to upstairs,
see what deal we can do with him.

04:43.630 --> 04:44.869
Dale.

04:47.171 --> 04:48.780
You're welcome, babe.

04:51.182 --> 04:53.486
So you've got "Man Tong Noodles" on board?

04:53.511 --> 04:56.277
- What do you mean?
- Are they going to sponsor the segment?

04:56.801 --> 04:58.812
How do I know?

05:02.372 --> 05:04.511
Hi. I'm heading home.

05:04.536 --> 05:06.637
I'm probably going to kill myself,

05:06.662 --> 05:08.157
but before I do,

05:08.182 --> 05:10.877
can you just meet me on the train
in Footscray in about five?

05:10.902 --> 05:12.797
<i>- Sure.</i>
- Thanks.

05:16.078 --> 05:19.493
For some this is all a game

05:20.662 --> 05:24.960
Don't take me just a fool

05:25.402 --> 05:29.679
Won't you just stay on the phone

05:29.859 --> 05:33.648
Faking smiles
and acting all the cool...

05:36.268 --> 05:37.963
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:38.064 --> 05:39.757
Didn't go well, then?

05:39.953 --> 05:42.657
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

05:45.258 --> 05:48.597
Look at how that guy is sitting.
He's taking up about five seats.

05:48.622 --> 05:51.117
Well, technically, it's only really two.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.357
No, it shits me.
Did he pay for two seats?

05:53.382 --> 05:54.837
No, he didn't.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.233
Doesn't matter. Train's empty.

05:57.822 --> 05:59.637
- What are you...?
- Shhh.

05:59.751 --> 06:01.548
- Put your phone away.
- Shhh.

06:01.635 --> 06:03.229
Lily...

06:04.382 --> 06:05.585
Lily.

06:05.610 --> 06:08.335
- What are you doing?
- What's going on here?

06:11.922 --> 06:13.477
Can I check your ticket, please?

06:13.502 --> 06:15.957
No, because I forgot to bring it.

06:15.982 --> 06:18.397
And I have a very good reason,
which I'm happy to explain.

06:18.422 --> 06:19.880
No, please don't.

06:22.902 --> 06:27.461
You can call me
when you're all alone, darling

06:27.938 --> 06:30.797
So to sum things up,
you completely blew your pitch.

06:30.822 --> 06:31.774
Yeah.

06:31.799 --> 06:34.283
And now you're forced
to produce a cooking segment,

06:34.308 --> 06:35.803
even though you can't cook.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.397
Well, she's not actually
doing the cooking.

06:37.422 --> 06:39.117
Shh! Have no interest in cooking.

06:39.142 --> 06:42.237
And you have to work with someone
who you don't respect

06:42.262 --> 06:44.317
and who doesn't respect you.

06:44.342 --> 06:47.264
Mmm. I'm not sure
that she doesn't respect me.

06:47.342 --> 06:49.117
I think we can safely assume
that she doesn't.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.997
Well, let's not go too far.

06:51.287 --> 06:53.610
I can't eat.

06:55.822 --> 06:57.357
Oh, God.

06:57.382 --> 06:59.197
It's an email from Sasha.

06:59.222 --> 07:02.342
I can't read it. Can you read it to me?

07:04.222 --> 07:07.437
"I'd like you all to welcome
Jack Winters to 'The Breakfast Bar'.

07:07.623 --> 07:10.637
"Jack is a dynamic
and forward-thinking chef

07:10.662 --> 07:12.757
"who reflects the current culture of food

07:12.787 --> 07:15.277
"that is both healthy and delicious."

07:15.302 --> 07:17.037
Sounds like a monster.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.157
Resign and be done with it.

07:19.182 --> 07:21.717
<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>, losers.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.517
And in case that's not clear enough,

07:23.542 --> 07:26.797
please send my fond farewell
to the new chef,

07:26.822 --> 07:31.717
who I have no doubt is a
monstrous piece of conceited turd.

07:31.742 --> 07:36.557
Thank God I'll never have to eat
that shit sandwich.

07:40.542 --> 07:44.197
I know I'm taking this badly,
but Sasha never goes for my ideas.

07:44.222 --> 07:47.197
I'm trying to think of an upside.
There isn't one.

07:47.222 --> 07:49.317
I'm not climbing up the career ladder,

07:49.342 --> 07:53.597
I am falling down, down, down.

07:53.622 --> 07:57.397
I have all these amazing ideas
and no-one wants them.

07:57.422 --> 07:58.877
You don't think you're catastrophising?

07:58.902 --> 08:02.339
No. The reality is the only place
I'd probably do well...

08:02.652 --> 08:05.316
- ...is in porn.
- Why would you do well in porn?

08:05.362 --> 08:07.437
So you don't even think
I could crack it there?

08:07.462 --> 08:09.117
Well, seeing as you've never
even watched porn,

08:09.142 --> 08:10.677
then I think you wouldn't be
that great at producing it.

08:10.702 --> 08:12.025
I've watched tons of porn.

08:12.050 --> 08:13.637
Foreign films are not considered porn.

08:13.662 --> 08:16.637
If everyone in the film is naked,
it's porn.

08:16.662 --> 08:19.623
Let's just leave that one alone,
shall we?

08:24.909 --> 08:27.172
What if this is it for me, Pete?

08:27.462 --> 08:29.490
What if no-one ever goes for my ideas

08:29.515 --> 08:32.957
and I just fumble along
until I'm old and alone

08:32.982 --> 08:36.883
and... maybe even really, really fat?

08:37.381 --> 08:38.996
And then I die.

08:39.288 --> 08:43.517
And then my pet, maybe a dog,

08:43.542 --> 08:45.397
maybe a parrot,

08:45.422 --> 08:47.997
mistakes my fat, bulging face

08:48.022 --> 08:51.157
for a pile of juicy
yet strangely pale sausages.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.911
Well, even when you're old and fat
and you have no face,

08:53.936 --> 08:55.237
I'll still be your friend.

08:55.262 --> 08:57.437
That's beautiful.

09:02.922 --> 09:04.422
Why did you do that?

09:04.662 --> 09:06.031
I don't know.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.989
Kiss me again.

09:18.302 --> 09:19.686
Lily...

09:20.420 --> 09:22.076
Ahh.

09:23.302 --> 09:25.493
Is... is that what you want?

09:33.343 --> 09:35.090
Kiss me back.

09:37.650 --> 09:39.517
Are you sure you wanna do this?

09:39.960 --> 09:42.739
We've been friends
for a really long time.

09:43.129 --> 09:47.585
Or is she in me

09:47.902 --> 09:51.335
And all the rest

09:52.542 --> 09:57.133
Well, baby, you're the best

09:57.222 --> 10:02.079
We'll figure out the rest

10:02.182 --> 10:06.805
And maybe it's a test

10:06.982 --> 10:09.557
I think we'd better quit

10:09.582 --> 10:16.116
While we're ahead

10:30.522 --> 10:34.636
Who was the last person
you had sex with before me?

10:36.502 --> 10:38.843
- No way.
- What?

10:40.400 --> 10:43.156
I know this is a trap. I don't know
what sort, but it's a trap.

10:43.182 --> 10:45.077
What are you talking about?

10:45.102 --> 10:47.277
We're best friends.

10:47.388 --> 10:49.117
We can tell each other anything.

10:49.142 --> 10:51.317
Oh, I... I don't want
to tell you about this.

10:51.342 --> 10:52.397
Why?

10:52.422 --> 10:54.902
Because these conversations
always end badly.

10:54.927 --> 10:56.437
Come on.

10:56.462 --> 10:57.638
Tell me.

11:01.342 --> 11:03.888
It was, er, a woman at work.

11:04.482 --> 11:06.325
A one-night stand?

11:06.462 --> 11:08.856
No, but it was pretty casual.

11:09.182 --> 11:11.337
- Did you like her?
- Yeah.

11:11.362 --> 11:14.167
But it was never going anywhere,
you know?

11:14.192 --> 11:16.707
It was just a sex thing
from her point of view.

11:17.465 --> 11:19.661
And what about from your point of view?

11:19.862 --> 11:24.036
I like her, but, you know,
she thinks I'm too young.

11:25.482 --> 11:27.028
How old is she?

11:27.222 --> 11:30.171
She's 42. She's gorgeous.

11:30.196 --> 11:32.330
Just got something about her.

11:32.355 --> 11:35.637
It's... you know,
it's difficult to describe.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.477
She kind of fascinates me, you know?

11:37.502 --> 11:39.458
- Are you serious?
- What?

11:39.483 --> 11:41.237
Why are you telling me about this woman?

11:41.262 --> 11:42.977
Because you asked.

11:43.002 --> 11:44.677
Have you thought for a second,
for a millisecond,

11:44.702 --> 11:46.197
how this might make me feel?

11:46.222 --> 11:48.199
- Now I am.
- Good!

11:48.636 --> 11:52.277
- Er, I didn't know you felt this way.
- Well, I do.

11:52.302 --> 11:54.099
I thought we were just friends
having fun.

11:54.124 --> 11:55.877
I didn't realise it meant more to you.

11:55.902 --> 11:58.423
- Oh, no. Don't you start that.
- What?

11:58.448 --> 12:01.237
Don't you even attempt
to excuse your bad behaviour

12:01.262 --> 12:03.557
by implying that I'm in love with you.

12:03.582 --> 12:05.517
No, I'm not saying that.
But you're so hurt.

12:05.542 --> 12:08.997
I'm not hurt, I'm appalled,
which is a very different thing.

12:09.022 --> 12:10.597
And if you don't understand
the difference

12:10.622 --> 12:13.157
between being hurt and being appalled,

12:13.182 --> 12:16.400
then you have no insight
into the human condition

12:16.425 --> 12:20.332
and I can only assume that you are
a heavily disguised narcissist.

12:24.021 --> 12:26.278
Just go home.

12:34.522 --> 12:37.007
Knew this conversation would end badly.

12:37.814 --> 12:39.897
And as I predicted...

12:41.322 --> 12:42.649
...it has.

12:45.069 --> 12:50.517
Hold on, I just got to let you know

12:50.542 --> 12:53.277
That I'm calling your mystery

12:53.302 --> 12:58.337
I hope that this moment's
not for show

12:58.362 --> 13:01.397
If only you could see that...

13:01.422 --> 13:05.057
Oh, well, I've got the fever now

13:05.088 --> 13:08.932
Oh, well, it's made me a believer...

13:24.502 --> 13:25.717
Oh, no.

13:25.742 --> 13:27.755
<i>In the interests of passenger safety,</i>

13:27.780 --> 13:30.895
<i>please refrain from running on the
platforms or in the station area.</i>

13:30.920 --> 13:32.197
Dale!

13:32.222 --> 13:34.117
Have you received a software update
on your phone?

13:34.142 --> 13:35.840
No.

13:41.302 --> 13:43.932
- No!
- I need your iPad too.

13:49.799 --> 13:51.237
Come in.

13:56.062 --> 13:58.877
She's just the girl,
she's just the girl

13:58.902 --> 14:00.331
The girl U want

14:01.662 --> 14:04.593
She's just the girl,
she's just the girl

14:13.907 --> 14:14.986
Did she fire you?

14:16.057 --> 14:18.307
I have to apologise to the chef.

14:18.718 --> 14:20.213
I would consider that a win.

14:20.238 --> 14:22.755
And get him back on board
to do our segment of the show.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.183
He'll never do it. Why do you say that?

14:25.208 --> 14:26.853
Because you called him a turd.

14:26.878 --> 14:29.893
How do you know that?
How does everybody know that?

14:29.918 --> 14:32.733
Because Sasha told me
and I told everyone else.

14:32.758 --> 14:34.857
Why, why, why would you do that?

14:34.882 --> 14:37.088
Because I thought it was funny.

14:37.158 --> 14:39.333
Clearly I misjudged it,
I can tell that from your face.

14:39.358 --> 14:41.475
Don't be angry at me.

14:41.918 --> 14:44.834
Oh, well... Yep.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.920
Dale, why do you do this job?

14:53.218 --> 14:56.146
Because one day, news will be dead.

14:56.438 --> 14:59.453
No-one will care,
no-one will mourn it except for me,

14:59.539 --> 15:02.234
so I want to be there the day it dies.

15:02.478 --> 15:04.575
I want to bear witness to its death

15:04.600 --> 15:07.853
and I want to feel proud I tried,

15:07.878 --> 15:11.225
however fruitlessly, to keep it alive.

15:11.545 --> 15:13.631
Dale, is there only one 'I'
in Kardashian?

15:14.186 --> 15:15.452
Yes.

15:15.590 --> 15:17.045
Yes, there is.

15:17.070 --> 15:18.369
Yes!

15:38.698 --> 15:40.263
Hello. Jack?

15:40.518 --> 15:42.223
- Yes. Hello.
- Hi.

15:43.198 --> 15:45.493
I'm Lily Woodward.

15:45.518 --> 15:47.493
You may know me
from a poorly worded email

15:47.518 --> 15:49.716
that I sent you at 7:10 this morning.

15:52.046 --> 15:54.462
- Come with me.
- Thank you.

15:56.558 --> 15:58.493
I want to say very clearly

15:58.518 --> 16:01.337
that it doesn't reflect
my feelings about you

16:01.497 --> 16:04.695
nor the level of respect
that I have for you.

16:05.524 --> 16:08.697
I want to apologise
as sincerely as possible...

16:08.722 --> 16:10.289
Shh.

16:10.314 --> 16:11.816
OK.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.926
Thank you. It...

16:22.438 --> 16:25.261
I'm getting the impression
you read the email.

16:26.434 --> 16:27.653
Yep.

16:36.118 --> 16:38.476
Um, what time do you want me in
tomorrow?

16:38.501 --> 16:40.053
If you want me in early,
it's no big deal.

16:40.281 --> 16:42.801
Well, it's whatever's on the roster.

16:43.033 --> 16:44.588
OK.

17:02.899 --> 17:06.397
Hey, you know this... us...

17:06.625 --> 17:08.219
isn't going anywhere?

17:08.647 --> 17:10.929
- What?
- You know what I mean.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.546
Maybe we can take it somewhere.

17:15.038 --> 17:19.749
Oh, you know that
I don't want a boyfriend, so...

17:19.877 --> 17:22.031
Yeah, especially one I work with.

17:25.992 --> 17:27.298
I'll get it.

17:29.398 --> 17:31.799
OK, so you've been to
the chef's restaurant,

17:31.878 --> 17:34.049
you've Facebooked him, you've
emailed him, you've called him.

17:34.074 --> 17:35.893
- Yes.
- Have you texted him?

17:35.918 --> 17:37.853
16 times.

17:37.878 --> 17:39.413
And he hasn't replied to any of them?

17:39.438 --> 17:40.773
No.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.639
- Why is he taunting you like this?
- Mmm!

17:42.664 --> 17:44.133
I don't know.

17:44.158 --> 17:45.453
He's turning you into a stalker.

17:45.478 --> 17:48.078
- He's forcing you to stalk him.
- I know.

17:48.377 --> 17:51.444
Let me see if I can find out
what he likes to do.

17:55.858 --> 17:57.954
I did it with Pete last night.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.039
Did what?

18:06.198 --> 18:08.665
- Ahh. How was it?
- Disastrous.

18:08.727 --> 18:12.517
Really? I always thought that
Pete would be quite good at sex.

18:12.542 --> 18:15.537
The sex was fine, but then he told me
he's been shagging someone else.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.023
I think I missed part of the story,
why was it a disaster?

18:19.048 --> 18:21.196
He's been shagging someone else.

18:21.947 --> 18:25.149
Big deal. Be grateful for the back-up.

18:25.198 --> 18:28.346
Mmm, from what I can tell,

18:28.371 --> 18:31.586
the chef spends most of his time
cooking,

18:31.798 --> 18:34.933
running, swimming, doing yoga
and meditating.

18:34.958 --> 18:37.133
Yeah, see, that actually sickens me.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.306
- Mm-hm.
- Aha!

18:39.509 --> 18:42.032
I found you.

18:42.318 --> 18:44.453
And I know where
you're gonna be tonight.

18:44.478 --> 18:46.253
Quick, Simone, lend me a dress.
I'm going out.

18:46.278 --> 18:47.610
Oh! Yeah.

18:57.638 --> 18:58.996
"Huge line.

18:59.021 --> 19:02.246
"You've worked at every club
in the city. How do I get in?"

19:13.382 --> 19:16.517
Busy night, huh? I got a call you
guys needed more lemons urgently.

19:16.542 --> 19:17.944
Cool.

19:21.558 --> 19:23.778
Have a good night.

19:40.418 --> 19:42.493
What's your most expensive champagne?

19:42.518 --> 19:44.773
- Bollinger.
- I'll take two glasses of that.

19:44.798 --> 19:47.093
- That's $45.
- What?!

19:47.118 --> 19:49.053
OK, changing the order.

19:49.078 --> 19:52.288
Two glasses of your cheapest champagne.

20:06.278 --> 20:09.699
This is for you. Bollinger.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.713
Oh.

20:14.978 --> 20:16.961
Please, enjoy.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.066
You're planning on following me
into the toilet?

20:32.091 --> 20:34.378
- If I have to. Wow.
- What do you want?

20:34.403 --> 20:36.813
- I want you to come and do our show.
- Why?

20:36.838 --> 20:39.115
Tell me in 20 words or less
why I should do it.

20:39.140 --> 20:43.213
Because if you don't,
I will lose my job.

20:43.238 --> 20:44.693
That's only nine. Dammit.

20:44.718 --> 20:46.160
Don't make it about you.

20:46.185 --> 20:48.881
Do I have 11 words left
or do I still have 20?

20:48.906 --> 20:49.738
11.

20:49.763 --> 20:56.065
Hundreds of thousands of people
watch our show every week.

20:56.566 --> 20:58.893
- And we can make you famous.
- I don't care about being famous.

20:58.958 --> 21:02.213
You have 146,000 Instagram followers.

21:02.238 --> 21:05.096
- I think you care a little bit.
- Don't tell me what I care about.

21:05.121 --> 21:08.016
What's important to me is food
and our relationship to food.

21:08.041 --> 21:10.471
And our show can only enhance that.

21:10.496 --> 21:13.493
We'll give you a new
and receptive audience

21:13.518 --> 21:16.190
that are always on tap
and always on your side.

21:16.215 --> 21:18.413
There's one thing that bothers me,
and when I say, "One thing,"

21:18.438 --> 21:20.373
- I mean, "One more thing."
- What?

21:20.398 --> 21:22.526
I wanna work with someone
who has a passion for food.

21:22.551 --> 21:25.432
Oh, that's me!
I... I have a real passion for food.

21:25.457 --> 21:26.933
- What's your favourite cuisine?
- Lean.

21:26.958 --> 21:28.271
Uh, I'm sorry, I panicked.

21:28.296 --> 21:30.053
What country's food do you most like?

21:30.078 --> 21:32.813
- Um...
- You honestly can't think of one?

21:32.838 --> 21:35.992
I just don't know what country
toasted sandwiches come from.

21:36.017 --> 21:37.606
I'm sorry, I don't trust you.

21:37.631 --> 21:40.333
Well, come and do one show with us

21:40.358 --> 21:42.453
and if you can't work with me,

21:42.478 --> 21:45.862
I'll resign and you'll never
have to deal with me again.

21:46.198 --> 21:47.690
Sounds perfect.

21:50.285 --> 21:52.097
What a knob.

21:57.101 --> 21:58.986
Hey, come in.

21:59.011 --> 22:00.939
Oh, yeah, thanks. It's my house.

22:02.026 --> 22:03.969
Simone?

22:06.769 --> 22:08.358
Simone!

22:10.998 --> 22:14.373
Hey, I invited
some friends back after work.

22:14.398 --> 22:17.451
You alright? Did you talk to Pete?

22:17.476 --> 22:20.795
I think my friendship with Pete is over.

22:20.953 --> 22:23.162
Maybe he told you about the other woman

22:23.187 --> 22:26.162
because he wants to bring
another woman into the relationship.

22:26.187 --> 22:29.522
Which is only a win for you,
we all get sick of the penis.

22:29.547 --> 22:33.402
No, he doesn't want to bring
another woman into the relationship.

22:33.427 --> 22:35.486
Firstly, there is no relationship.

22:35.511 --> 22:37.362
And if there was, he's actually saying

22:37.387 --> 22:41.957
he wants someone else instead of,
not in addition, to me.

22:42.837 --> 22:46.612
- Why do you care?
- I don't care. I just...

22:46.747 --> 22:49.782
I think it's...
I think it's poor form, that's all.

22:49.807 --> 22:52.492
Don't have sex with me if you're
thinking about someone else.

22:53.031 --> 22:54.762
Sounds like you care a bit.

22:54.787 --> 22:57.122
Do you think I wanna be with Pete?

22:57.147 --> 22:58.922
Well, do you?

22:58.947 --> 23:01.122
No... No.

23:01.331 --> 23:02.842
I just...

23:02.867 --> 23:05.082
I guess I wanted him
to wanna be with me.

23:05.264 --> 23:07.534
So you could reject him?

23:08.397 --> 23:11.002
No. No, no, no, no.

23:11.027 --> 23:12.897
I... I've had enough of men.

23:12.922 --> 23:15.358
No more men. I'm sick of them.

23:15.707 --> 23:18.423
I'll join you. No more men.

23:19.487 --> 23:21.082
Do you wanna come and do some shots?

23:21.468 --> 23:23.682
No. I'm going to bed.

23:23.707 --> 23:25.122
I'll do some for you.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.451
You do that.

23:53.603 --> 23:54.955
Oi!

23:55.347 --> 23:56.386
Oi.

23:59.625 --> 24:02.442
Oh! What are you doing? Get out!

24:02.867 --> 24:04.842
Sorry, I think I misread the situation.

24:04.867 --> 24:06.603
Get out.

24:17.335 --> 24:19.727
- What can I get you?
- Decaf soy latte.

24:20.507 --> 24:22.658
- I'm not making it.
- What?

24:22.947 --> 24:24.522
- I'm not making it.
- Why?

24:24.774 --> 24:26.762
Because this is a coffee shop,
we serve coffee.

24:26.787 --> 24:29.015
And coffee, by definition,
is caffeinated.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.242
I'll make you a coffee, I'll make you
any sort of coffee you want,

24:31.267 --> 24:33.377
I'll even concede to
a coffee made with soy milk,

24:33.402 --> 24:35.882
but I will not make a coffee
that contains no caffeine

24:35.907 --> 24:38.142
because that is not coffee.

24:38.347 --> 24:40.603
I'll make it.

24:48.427 --> 24:50.402
Ah! Hello and welcome!

24:50.427 --> 24:52.402
- Is it Nikkii?
- Yes, it is. Hi.

24:52.427 --> 24:55.349
- And I've met Lily.
- Hello. Good to see you.

24:56.517 --> 24:59.462
Uh, so what we thought we'd do is
just a very, very casual rehearsal

24:59.487 --> 25:01.732
and just walk you through the steps
of the cooking segment.

25:01.757 --> 25:02.772
Fine.

25:02.797 --> 25:05.064
Now, what usually happens
is that you have an earpiece

25:05.089 --> 25:06.562
and we talk you through what's going on.

25:06.587 --> 25:09.642
So who would you feel
more comfortable hearing from,

25:09.667 --> 25:11.182
Lily or me?

25:11.207 --> 25:13.682
Or should we just let the universe
work it out? Oh!

25:13.707 --> 25:16.322
Now, I've got a few ideas
I'd like to talk through with you.

25:16.347 --> 25:18.962
My feeling is,
as it's your first time on air,

25:18.987 --> 25:21.362
you don't have to say too much,
we can focus on...

25:21.387 --> 25:23.958
Nikkii. I'd rather hear from Nikkii.

25:24.147 --> 25:27.522
What? Well, I'm flattered.
The universe did work it out.

25:27.547 --> 25:28.922
It wasn't the universe.

25:28.947 --> 25:30.390
OK, it's this way, Jack.

25:32.007 --> 25:35.602
He needs to be well-rehearsed,
so take as much time as you need.

25:35.627 --> 25:38.002
Get him used to having
someone in his ear.

25:38.027 --> 25:40.431
I'm all over it.

25:41.587 --> 25:43.253
Keep him happy.

25:43.427 --> 25:44.964
He is.

25:45.854 --> 25:47.714
He's very happy.

25:49.136 --> 25:50.822
Phew.

25:50.847 --> 25:53.159
Need to get that table fixed.
Got a wonky leg.

25:53.184 --> 25:56.562
- Oh, I can fix it.
- I don't need you fixing my furniture.

26:02.467 --> 26:04.882
Hey, do you want to go outside,
have a bit of kick-to-kick?

26:04.907 --> 26:07.882
Oh, I'm shattered, Dad.
You're always bloody shattered.

26:07.907 --> 26:09.389
You're soft!

26:12.707 --> 26:15.162
Hey, um, I'm gonna put
a couple of steaks on.

26:15.487 --> 26:16.992
- Happy with that?
- Yeah.

26:17.187 --> 26:18.642
Hey, get Lily over.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.099
She's always fun.

26:20.387 --> 26:23.435
Uh, no, she's busy tonight, Dad.

26:23.849 --> 26:25.974
I like her more than I like you.

26:47.367 --> 26:50.323
"Will I still come to dinner
with your parents?"

26:56.657 --> 26:58.274
<i>Up to you.</i>

27:01.267 --> 27:03.103
- Darling.
- Thanks, Lil. Thanks, Mum.

27:03.128 --> 27:04.829
- Love you.
- Hi, guys, sorry I'm late.

27:04.854 --> 27:06.962
I was working but thought
I'd drop in for a drink.

27:06.987 --> 27:08.344
Happy birthday, mate, good to see you.

27:08.369 --> 27:09.922
- Hi, Mimi.
- Good. You?

27:09.947 --> 27:12.191
- Tony, how's things?
- Hey, Pete, how's your dad?

27:12.216 --> 27:13.962
- Yeah, he's good.
- Grab a seat.

27:13.987 --> 27:15.822
- How's work, Lil?
- It's good.

27:15.847 --> 27:17.659
I've been given a cooking
segment to produce.

27:17.684 --> 27:19.042
- Really?
- Oh!

27:19.067 --> 27:21.762
- That is wonderful!
- Pete doesn't think much of it.

27:21.787 --> 27:24.682
Or me, for that matter. He thinks
I'd struggle to produce porn.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.322
Are you planning to produce porn?

27:27.347 --> 27:29.322
Mmm. It might well come to that.

27:29.347 --> 27:32.563
Oh, right.
OK, Pete, how's your love life?

27:32.588 --> 27:34.799
Uh, yeah, nothing much to report, Mimi.

27:34.824 --> 27:37.563
My advice to you, Pete, is enjoy
yourself before you get married,

27:37.588 --> 27:39.842
have as much fun as you can.

27:39.867 --> 27:41.962
Thanks, Tony. Yeah,
it's good advice. I'm trying to.

27:41.987 --> 27:43.642
Oh, really? Is that what you're doing?

27:43.667 --> 27:46.242
Well, you know, I regret not just
playing the field a bit more

27:46.267 --> 27:49.183
- before I tied the knot.
- Oh, well, made up for it after.

27:50.307 --> 27:51.656
So, Vinnie, I heard that

27:51.681 --> 27:53.492
you're applying for a job
at the Prince hospital.

27:53.517 --> 27:56.748
Yeah. They, um, called me in
for an interview but...

27:56.773 --> 27:58.242
- And?
- Um...

27:58.267 --> 28:00.201
But I saw their faces
when I arrived and I...

28:00.227 --> 28:02.082
- Oh, you don't know.
- No, I do know.

28:02.107 --> 28:04.601
I got a letter today... no job.

28:05.359 --> 28:07.685
- Uh, that's alright.
- Right.

28:07.710 --> 28:10.706
And I have some news for everyone.

28:10.731 --> 28:13.761
I have a new baby.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.482
- Look at it.
- Wow.

28:16.507 --> 28:19.682
- Hey! Oh, is it an electric car?
- Yes, indeed.

28:20.425 --> 28:21.865
Wow!

28:22.227 --> 28:24.402
But how much did that cost?

28:24.427 --> 28:25.882
- Mum...
- What?

28:25.907 --> 28:29.002
- I'm just asking how much it costs.
- It doesn't matter, Mum.

28:29.027 --> 28:31.002
Darling, please don't infer
that I'm behaving badly

28:31.027 --> 28:33.042
when the only person behaving badly
here is your father.

28:33.067 --> 28:34.562
- Oh, here we go.
- I mean...

28:34.587 --> 28:37.282
Seriously, how many midlife crises
do you plan to have?

28:37.307 --> 28:40.402
You got the implants,
screwed your secretary,

28:40.489 --> 28:43.354
did paleo, I mean,
what is going to happen next?

28:43.953 --> 28:45.562
You gonna have a crack at Pete?

28:45.602 --> 28:48.320
Hey! Didn't see that comin'. Ah...

28:48.979 --> 28:51.273
I do not have hair implants.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.558
Come on, Vincent.

28:56.578 --> 28:58.776
- Let's go.
- Fine.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.145
I can do it, Mum, let go of me.

29:02.170 --> 29:04.202
- It's alright, darling.
- See you, mate. Happy birthday.

29:04.227 --> 29:05.944
Yep. It's alright, Mum.

29:06.109 --> 29:07.562
- See you, Mimi. 'Bye.
- 'Bye, Pete.

29:07.587 --> 29:08.858
- Have a good night.
- 'Bye.

29:08.883 --> 29:10.442
- See you, Tony. Stay well.
- See you.

29:10.467 --> 29:12.428
I've got you.

29:21.467 --> 29:25.538
- Lily, I don't bag your career.
- You bag everything.

29:25.667 --> 29:28.437
You sneer at anyone who's not living
the way you want them to live.

29:28.487 --> 29:31.168
But what about you? You're a brainy
guy and you work as a barista.

29:31.193 --> 29:33.482
Yeah, well, I do that to make money.

29:33.507 --> 29:35.202
I'm a music journalist writing a book.

29:35.227 --> 29:37.962
You've been writing that book
for four years.

29:37.987 --> 29:39.482
Well, I wanna get it right.

29:39.507 --> 29:41.290
You know the first thing to do
to get it right?

29:41.315 --> 29:43.562
You could get some letters,
make some words

29:43.587 --> 29:45.457
and put them down on a piece of paper!

29:45.482 --> 29:47.873
- Lily, thanks very much.
- No, when you had no money

29:47.897 --> 29:50.202
and you had to sell
that PlayStation on eBay,

29:50.227 --> 29:51.246
who do you think bought it?

29:51.271 --> 29:54.082
I know you want me to say "I don't
know," but by asking the question...

29:54.107 --> 29:56.642
It was #TeamMe.

29:56.667 --> 29:58.162
Please don't say hashtag.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.170
So you're gonna bag
the way I argue with you now?

30:00.195 --> 30:02.280
No! No, I'm just...

30:03.241 --> 30:05.428
Hang on, if you bought my PlayStation,

30:05.453 --> 30:06.718
then why didn't you give it back to me?

30:06.743 --> 30:08.539
'Cause I started playing it
and I actually really liked it.

30:08.564 --> 30:12.608
But the point is I could not have
been more supportive of you.

30:12.633 --> 30:15.499
It's been four years because the nature
and focus of the work's changed.

30:15.524 --> 30:18.940
How can the evolution
of Radiohead change?

30:18.965 --> 30:20.528
Well, based on social context...

30:20.553 --> 30:23.180
That's not a real question! No!

30:23.205 --> 30:26.533
It's been four years because you're
too scared to commit to anything.

30:26.558 --> 30:29.281
You chop and change and
you never have to fail at anything

30:29.306 --> 30:30.968
'cause you never try to do well.

30:30.993 --> 30:32.528
You just wait, in 10 years time,

30:32.553 --> 30:34.148
you'll still be working
in a coffee shop.

30:34.173 --> 30:36.573
Oh, no, wait, actually, no, you won't
because you'll be old

30:36.598 --> 30:39.008
and they don't want some fat old guy
making their pitsy coffee.

30:39.033 --> 30:40.676
Is this about us
hooking up the other night?

30:40.701 --> 30:42.553
Because if it is,
it really wasn't worth it.

30:46.517 --> 30:48.139
I can't be friends with you anymore.

30:48.164 --> 30:49.451
Um...

30:50.113 --> 30:51.808
So, what, you're going to throw away

30:51.833 --> 30:54.008
our entire friendship
because of one night?

30:54.212 --> 30:56.043
One stupid night?

31:00.840 --> 31:02.539
Oh, you're a piece of work.

31:17.073 --> 31:18.388
You alright, mate?

31:18.413 --> 31:21.418
Yeah, yeah, just taking in the night.

31:24.473 --> 31:27.316
I'll sit with you for a moment,
if that's alright.

31:33.953 --> 31:35.559
I stuffed up, Dad.

31:39.793 --> 31:43.192
I hooked up with Lily
and now things are weird.

31:43.217 --> 31:46.404
She doesn't want to see me,
she doesn't want to be friends.

31:49.315 --> 31:51.451
I don't know what 'hooked up' means.

31:53.713 --> 31:55.077
Shagged.

32:00.093 --> 32:01.446
Got it.

32:04.285 --> 32:05.969
Well, you stuffed up.

32:13.533 --> 32:16.111
OK, turn... Stop.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.568
Why am I doing this tonight?

32:18.593 --> 32:20.328
Turn... stop.

32:20.353 --> 32:22.688
I don't know, I thought
I might wear it tomorrow.

32:24.833 --> 32:26.608
You like Pete, right?

32:26.633 --> 32:28.608
Sure. I love him.

32:28.766 --> 32:29.741
Turn.

32:29.927 --> 32:31.368
Stop.

32:32.111 --> 32:34.130
I was with Pete the other night.

32:34.604 --> 32:36.963
- Oh, yeah?
- No, no.

32:37.071 --> 32:39.675
I wasn't just with him.

32:42.713 --> 32:44.566
OK.

32:44.792 --> 32:46.581
We were...

32:46.691 --> 32:48.191
Anyway, we were together.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.309
But don't worry,
nothing's gonna happen with us.

32:51.113 --> 32:52.848
He likes someone else.

32:53.245 --> 32:56.394
Lil, I don't care about Pete.

32:56.473 --> 32:57.831
I care about you.

32:57.993 --> 32:59.406
What do you want?

33:01.555 --> 33:04.195
I just want things to go back
to the way they were before.

33:05.154 --> 33:09.756
I said really nasty stuff to him
and I didn't mean any of it.

33:10.092 --> 33:11.810
I just said it to hurt him.

33:14.080 --> 33:17.808
Look, you are a very smart girl.

33:17.833 --> 33:21.315
Just give each other
some leeway and then...

33:22.153 --> 33:26.047
...be just a little more generous
than you think is fair.

33:34.798 --> 33:39.233
<i>Hey, you want to meet up?</i>

33:39.873 --> 33:42.429
<i>Yes. When?</i>

33:42.571 --> 33:44.749
<i>Tomorrow night? My place?</i>

34:20.701 --> 34:23.326
So, Hamilton, it's going to be very
hot for this time of year today.

34:23.351 --> 34:25.904
Would you say that's
a direct result of global warming?

34:26.527 --> 34:30.328
No, Eric, I'd say that's
a direct result of the sun's rays

34:30.353 --> 34:32.465
hitting the Southern Hemisphere
at an acute angle.

34:32.489 --> 34:35.168
This angle you speak of,
caused by global warming.

34:35.193 --> 34:37.255
- Nothing to do with it, Eric.
- Eric, stop talking.

34:37.621 --> 34:39.839
Great work, Eric. Let's go to Hamilton.

34:39.864 --> 34:41.848
Straight after the weather
we're going to the cooking segment.

34:41.873 --> 34:44.159
- Jack, can you hear me?
- <i>Ahh. Yeah, it's loud.</i>

34:44.185 --> 34:45.308
Oh, sorry.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.754
- Erica, head over to the kitchen set.
<i>- OK, Jack.</i>

34:47.779 --> 34:50.196
<i>Now I know that Nikkii talked
this through with you yesterday,</i>

34:50.221 --> 34:52.768
but let's just go through it
one more time.

34:52.793 --> 34:54.688
<i>We'll have your intro on autocue</i>

34:54.713 --> 34:56.648
<i>so you can look at that if you need to.</i>

34:56.672 --> 34:59.188
Then Erica's gonna come
and ask you some questions.

34:59.448 --> 35:02.728
Those questions won't be on autocue.
Have you got that?

35:03.144 --> 35:05.458
OK, if you can't think of things to say,

35:05.483 --> 35:06.958
just talk about the origins of the dish.

35:06.983 --> 35:08.008
He knows that.

35:08.033 --> 35:10.194
Did you get him the list of facts
about Mexican street food?

35:10.219 --> 35:11.928
He knows about Mexican street food.

35:11.953 --> 35:13.359
How do you know? Did he tell you that?

35:13.384 --> 35:16.205
OK, we're coming
to the kitchen in five...

35:16.513 --> 35:18.338
...four, three,

35:18.541 --> 35:19.848
- two...
- Good luck, Jack.

35:19.873 --> 35:21.968
<i>Back to you, have fun
in the kitchen, Erica.</i>

35:22.284 --> 35:25.099
<i>I understand we're having tacos today.</i>

35:25.124 --> 35:27.114
<i>Yes, we are, Erica.
One of my favourite quick meals.</i>

35:27.139 --> 35:28.280
- Really good.
- <i>Fantastic.</i>

35:28.304 --> 35:30.072
She's gonna introduce you
now to the viewers.

35:30.073 --> 35:32.648
<i>This is Jack, he's our new chef
on 'The Breakfast Bar',</i>

35:32.673 --> 35:34.862
although a lot of you must be
quite familiar with him.

35:34.887 --> 35:41.163
I understand, Jack, that you have 146,000
Instagram followers. Is that true?

35:41.188 --> 35:44.168
Well, I'm not sure, Erica,
but I appreciate every one of them.

35:44.193 --> 35:45.596
Really good.

35:45.633 --> 35:48.745
Make sure you're facing Erica,
that's who you're talking to.

35:48.770 --> 35:50.937
<i>Umm, sorry, I didn't hear your question.</i>

35:50.962 --> 35:53.008
<i>Could you tell us how to
make the perfect taco?</i>

35:53.033 --> 35:55.604
Make sure you're facing
the camera. Don't face Erica.

35:55.629 --> 35:58.368
The important thing is that
the camera can see you.

35:58.523 --> 36:00.646
Urgh, that looked a bit awkward.

36:00.671 --> 36:03.123
Just try and move smoothly
but never turn your back...

36:03.148 --> 36:04.978
- Stop talking.
- What?

36:05.003 --> 36:07.638
Look, you're speaking too much
and he can't hear Erica.

36:07.663 --> 36:09.530
Just less is more. Be quiet.

36:09.713 --> 36:12.408
<i>Well, Erica, you have to
put some love into it.</i>

36:12.433 --> 36:14.911
<i>Don't let the food absorb your stress.</i>

36:14.994 --> 36:16.635
<i>I love that attitude in the kitchen.</i>

36:16.660 --> 36:18.455
<i>Don't you love that attitude, Eric?</i>

36:18.480 --> 36:20.248
<i>Oh, mucho taco.</i>

36:20.273 --> 36:22.128
<i>So...</i>

36:22.153 --> 36:24.828
If she asks anything you don't know,
just talk about the ingredients.

36:25.021 --> 36:26.693
<i>I'm sorry, I didn't hear your question.</i>

36:26.718 --> 36:29.608
- Just talk about an ingredient.
- Let him answer the question.

36:29.633 --> 36:31.476
- He doesn't know it.
- He can't hear it.

36:31.501 --> 36:33.991
Is the foot pain segment ready?
Might need to pull it forward.

36:34.016 --> 36:35.226
- Yep.
- Tell her about garlic.

36:35.251 --> 36:36.541
<i>Uh, garlic...</i>

36:36.633 --> 36:38.368
<i>Garlic is quite an amazing food.</i>

36:38.393 --> 36:40.248
<i>It contains an ingredient
called allicin,</i>

36:40.273 --> 36:42.648
<i>which is a natural antibiotic.</i>

36:42.673 --> 36:44.514
<i>Wow, allicin. That's fantastic.</i>

36:44.539 --> 36:47.615
<i>Can you tell us how garlic is used
in this particular recipe?</i>

36:49.313 --> 36:51.208
<i>Garlic's not used in this recipe.</i>

36:51.233 --> 36:52.103
Oh, shit.

36:52.128 --> 36:53.932
- Oh, God, just talk about something else.
- <i>Right.</i>

36:53.956 --> 36:55.391
- Anything!
- <i>Ahh!</i>

36:55.416 --> 36:57.110
- <i>Oh, are you alright?</i>
- Oh, Jesus.

36:57.135 --> 36:59.088
I love this show.

36:59.113 --> 37:00.608
Take the headset off.

37:00.633 --> 37:02.697
- Take it off, Nikkii.
- Take it off, Nikkii.

37:02.953 --> 37:06.328
OK, Dale, get me some interesting
facts about Mexican street food.

37:06.353 --> 37:09.315
Can you just go to a close-up
on the food? Stay on that.

37:09.340 --> 37:10.375
Camera four.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.088
Keep describing the ingredients.

37:12.113 --> 37:13.328
Jack, it's Lily.

37:13.353 --> 37:15.171
Deep breaths, be calm.

37:15.196 --> 37:18.488
The camera is not on you right now,
it's on the food.

37:18.513 --> 37:20.145
What have you got?

37:20.233 --> 37:23.623
I want you to listen carefully
and repeat after me.

37:24.233 --> 37:27.139
Erica, I can tell you
some pretty cool facts

37:27.164 --> 37:28.488
about Mexican street food.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.570
<i>Erica, I can tell you
some pretty cool facts</i>

37:30.595 --> 37:31.968
<i>about Mexican street food.</i>

37:31.993 --> 37:35.088
I would love to hear some facts
about Mexican street food.

37:35.113 --> 37:38.688
The word 'taco' actually means
'light lunch' in Spanish.

37:38.713 --> 37:41.208
<i>Well, taco actually means
'light lunch' in Spanish.</i>

37:41.233 --> 37:43.168
<i>Light lunch? I did not know that.</i>

37:43.193 --> 37:44.968
- The taco was created...
- <i>Anything else?</i>

37:44.993 --> 37:47.208
...by the indigenous people of Mexico.

37:47.530 --> 37:48.808
<i>How very interesting.</i>

37:48.833 --> 37:51.488
When the Spanish arrived in Mexico...

37:51.513 --> 37:54.768
...they loved it
and renamed it the taco.

37:55.039 --> 37:56.814
<i>The taco. There you go.</i>

37:56.839 --> 37:58.488
Voila. <i>Sorry, that's French.</i>

37:58.513 --> 37:59.528
Gracias.

37:59.553 --> 38:01.182
Buen provecho.

38:01.273 --> 38:03.128
<i>Mmm, that's really good.</i>

38:03.153 --> 38:04.527
<i>Thank you so much, Jack.</i>

38:04.552 --> 38:07.648
And four. The kitchen
is closed, thank God.

38:07.673 --> 38:09.754
<i>- ...help you back on your feet.</i>
- Well done.

38:09.825 --> 38:11.240
<i>Coming up next.</i>

38:11.273 --> 38:12.468
And we're clear.

38:12.493 --> 38:15.101
<i>So can anyone tell me
what the hell just happened there?</i>

38:15.146 --> 38:16.161
<i>Sasha?!</i>

38:16.186 --> 38:17.781
- Oh, shit.
- <i>Can they hear me?</i>

38:17.853 --> 38:19.560
- The doors.
- <i>Don't worry.</i>

38:19.873 --> 38:21.646
- <i>Sasha, can I speak to you?</i>
- She's coming up.

38:21.671 --> 38:22.684
- What do you want me to do, - <i>Sasha!</i>

38:22.716 --> 38:24.606
avoid her? Where are you going?

38:26.761 --> 38:27.998
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:28.023 --> 38:29.655
I found all that talk really confusing.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.586
You could not ear.
You did well, I mean it.

38:31.611 --> 38:33.715
No-one noticed. It was actually amazing.

38:34.183 --> 38:36.121
You're a natural.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.174
Bloody hell, what a nightmare.

38:39.199 --> 38:40.758
Tell me what's happening
on social media.

38:40.783 --> 38:42.175
- Are we being destroyed?
- Well, it's...

38:42.199 --> 38:44.487
- No, I don't want to know.
- OK.

38:44.575 --> 38:47.390
Tell me. Yeah, tell me. I'm ready.

38:47.415 --> 38:50.110
"The new chef is so cute,
I feel sorry for him."

38:50.135 --> 38:51.601
"I wish he'd take his shirt off."

38:51.626 --> 38:53.602
"Did you see him wince? I hope he's OK."

38:53.627 --> 38:54.860
"He is HAWT."

38:54.885 --> 38:57.477
- Well, that's a relief.
- Man, you should be psyched.

39:07.252 --> 39:08.971
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:09.415 --> 39:12.671
Um, come in.
You want a coffee or something?

39:12.696 --> 39:16.751
No, no. There's just something
I want to talk to you about.

39:16.919 --> 39:20.004
I just wanted to speak with you
away from work.

39:20.183 --> 39:22.691
Ahh, yeah, yeah, come in.

39:35.481 --> 39:37.971
Well, it's... it's who I am. Yeah.

39:37.996 --> 39:40.815
- Do you want... Yeah.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

39:41.496 --> 39:42.871
No, thank you.

39:42.896 --> 39:45.991
- You know how we swore off men?
- I knew you wouldn't last.

39:46.016 --> 39:48.391
Oh, no, I am lasting. You got it wrong.

39:48.416 --> 39:51.471
I just wanted dispensation and
I'm willing to give you one too.

39:51.496 --> 39:53.951
What exactly are the rules
of the dispensation?

39:53.976 --> 39:57.551
If we meet someone we really like,
we can hook up with them.

39:57.576 --> 39:59.571
Then we're not swearing off men.

39:59.596 --> 40:02.419
- Oh, really, you can't stick to it?
- I can stick to it.

40:02.444 --> 40:04.138
I'm just saying it's like saying,

40:04.176 --> 40:06.671
"I'm vegetarian
except spaghetti bolognese."

40:06.696 --> 40:08.791
God, don't talk to me about vegetarians.

40:08.816 --> 40:11.690
Everyone hates them
and rightly so, I believe.

40:11.744 --> 40:14.592
- I grant you a dispensation.
- And I grant you yours.

40:14.616 --> 40:16.031
I don't even want one.

40:16.056 --> 40:17.871
And yet I'm still
willing to give it to you,

40:17.896 --> 40:19.711
which shows what a generous person I am.

40:19.736 --> 40:21.711
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

40:21.736 --> 40:23.511
Ding, ding.

40:23.536 --> 40:25.511
I just wanted to say a few words.

40:25.536 --> 40:28.751
I wanted to officially welcome Jack.

40:28.776 --> 40:32.151
This morning's segment had
a couple of tough moments.

40:33.236 --> 40:36.271
Moments that we've all
experienced in live TV.

40:36.296 --> 40:38.071
Experienced? Doesn't she mean created?

40:38.096 --> 40:40.016
I think we managed to move through it...

40:40.041 --> 40:41.951
By panicking and falling to pieces?

40:41.976 --> 40:44.511
...and create what I think is
going to be an awesome segment.

40:44.536 --> 40:46.991
In spite of you being involved in it.

40:47.016 --> 40:48.351
So, Jack,

40:48.940 --> 40:54.231
I am very excited to be producing
this segment with you and...

40:54.256 --> 40:57.431
- Well, to Jack.
- To Jack.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.383
To Jack!

41:00.056 --> 41:01.227
Come with me.

41:02.816 --> 41:04.631
Thanks for today.

41:04.656 --> 41:06.471
You really turned it around for me.

41:06.981 --> 41:09.286
It's my job.

41:11.276 --> 41:13.979
Wow. Let's share it.

41:18.886 --> 41:21.049
I love the thrill of live TV.

41:21.620 --> 41:23.311
It's exciting.

41:23.486 --> 41:28.885
Oh, this is actually beautiful.

41:29.256 --> 41:31.671
That wasn't a cool vibe
you sent me in the email.

41:32.050 --> 41:33.876
Bad day at work.

41:33.901 --> 41:35.751
Another idea rejected.

41:35.776 --> 41:37.591
So what's your big dream?

41:37.616 --> 41:39.551
I want to make documentaries.

41:39.576 --> 41:41.291
So why aren't you?

41:42.336 --> 41:45.751
Because even though I want
to make documentaries,

41:45.776 --> 41:49.297
no-one seems to want to actually
pay me to make documentaries.

41:49.875 --> 41:51.311
What about you?

41:51.336 --> 41:53.351
Why did you become a chef?

41:53.539 --> 41:55.032
I don't know, I...

41:55.493 --> 41:58.210
went through some
changes a few years ago.

41:58.235 --> 42:00.831
Decided I'd start
treating my body differently.

42:00.856 --> 42:02.591
Have more respect for it.

42:02.616 --> 42:05.610
Don't fill it with poison
every chance you get.

42:06.608 --> 42:08.383
What was your poison?

42:08.416 --> 42:10.404
I wasn't particularly discerning.

42:10.856 --> 42:12.183
So what now?

42:13.176 --> 42:16.790
I think I've had my lifetime's
entitlement of drugs and alcohol.

42:18.396 --> 42:20.871
Hey, we should get going.
We better get the train.

42:20.896 --> 42:22.071
I'll drop you.

42:22.096 --> 42:24.071
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

42:24.096 --> 42:27.111
OK. Great, um, thanks.

42:27.136 --> 42:30.004
Can I get a doggie bag for this?

42:33.840 --> 42:36.352
- Thanks for the lift.
- Coming in?

42:36.376 --> 42:38.671
- I better not.
- Oh, you have to come in.

42:38.696 --> 42:41.423
You need at least
one more drink to celebrate.

42:46.845 --> 42:48.559
Not for me.

42:48.912 --> 42:51.527
- Thank you.
- I'll be right back.

43:01.727 --> 43:03.980
That's too much.

43:36.854 --> 43:38.651
<i>Four reasons
you should still be my friend.</i>

43:38.823 --> 43:40.647
<i>One, I'm a mad dancer.</i>

43:42.496 --> 43:45.241
<i>Two, I can kick a goal
from 50 metres into the breeze.</i>

43:46.443 --> 43:48.921
<i>Three, I always take you
to putt-putt on your birthday</i>

43:48.946 --> 43:50.382
<i>even though you know I hate it.</i>

43:52.490 --> 43:54.357
<i>Where is reason number four?</i>

43:57.728 --> 43:59.103
Here.

44:02.796 --> 44:06.298
Sorry, I knocked on the front door,
but no-one answered.

44:06.595 --> 44:08.079
I didn't hear it.

44:20.884 --> 44:22.977
I want to go back to how things were.

44:24.898 --> 44:27.070
Do you wish we hadn't crossed that line?

44:27.758 --> 44:29.102
No.

44:29.922 --> 44:32.492
No, crossing the line was...

44:33.160 --> 44:34.996
...was perfect.

44:37.723 --> 44:39.442
It made sense at the time.

44:41.056 --> 44:43.520
It felt right.

44:45.044 --> 44:47.005
I remember thinking,

44:47.844 --> 44:51.218
"Why hasn't this happened before?"

44:52.367 --> 44:54.335
Yeah, I thought that too.

44:56.570 --> 44:58.234
What do you think now?

45:09.166 --> 45:12.213
That other woman
I told you about, Meredith.

45:12.901 --> 45:14.064
What?

45:15.991 --> 45:17.522
She's pregnant.

45:24.113 --> 45:25.629
Oh, Pete.
