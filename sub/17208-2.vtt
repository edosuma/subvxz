00:05.714 --> 00:07.424
JANE:

00:05.714 --> 00:07.424
Help! Somebody help!

00:07.424 --> 00:08.968
<i>But thank God he's okay.</i>

00:08.968 --> 00:10.886
You better not be back

00:08.968 --> 00:10.886

<i>Well, imagine this: Jane's</i>

00:25.693 --> 00:28.570

00:38.914 --> 00:40.749
<i>So, let's do this, people!</i>

00:45.504 --> 00:46.839
Okay.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.008
Have a good day first

00:46.839 --> 00:49.008
day back at work.

00:49.008 --> 00:51.218
NARRATOR:

00:49.008 --> 00:51.218
<i>When Jane Gloriana Villanueva</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:54.429

00:54.429 --> 00:55.848
Thank you.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.725
It's gonna be okay,

00:55.848 --> 00:57.725
I promise.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.100
Mm-hmm.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.236
( gunshots )

01:09.236 --> 01:11.238
Michael?

01:11.238 --> 01:12.531
Michael!

01:12.531 --> 01:14.742
No, no! Michael!

<i>she had the worst</i>

01:20.497 --> 01:22.750
Are you okay?

01:22.750 --> 01:25.627
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.380
<i>...based on her</i>

01:25.627 --> 01:28.380
<i>worst nightmare ever.</i>

01:28.380 --> 01:30.883
We're gonna put

01:28.380 --> 01:30.883
this behind us, okay?

01:30.883 --> 01:32.760
Just takes time.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.679
NARRATOR:

01:32.760 --> 01:35.679
<i>And Jane really hoped</i>

01:32.760 --> 01:35.679
<i>that was true.</i>

01:42.185 --> 01:43.979
Okay, here we go.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.940
Have a good first day.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.566
You sure you're okay?

01:47.566 --> 01:48.984
A little nervous...

01:48.984 --> 01:50.318
Okay, very nervous.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.153
But... I can do this.

01:54.073 --> 01:55.074
I love you.

01:55.074 --> 01:56.283
I love you, too.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.868
Okay, now go before

01:56.283 --> 01:57.868
I'm not okay!

01:57.868 --> 01:59.327
Okay.

02:02.998 --> 02:05.208
( gunshots )

02:05.208 --> 02:07.086
Michael!

02:07.086 --> 02:09.755
( gasps )

02:16.136 --> 02:19.974
<i>But so far, not so much.</i>

02:19.974 --> 02:21.642
NURSE:

02:19.974 --> 02:21.642
<i>Just keep in mind,</i>

02:21.642 --> 02:23.685
<i>recovery is not</i>

02:21.642 --> 02:23.685
<i>a straight line.</i>

02:23.685 --> 02:27.064
And going home, there's going

02:23.685 --> 02:27.064
to be an adjustment period.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.274
Well, it's an adjustment

02:27.064 --> 02:29.274
I'm looking forward to.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.026
Me, too.

02:31.026 --> 02:32.235
No.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.779
I said no more

02:32.235 --> 02:33.779
crackers... I said no.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.824
There we are.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.824
Do you think

02:33.779 --> 02:36.824
that we can go over

02:36.824 --> 02:38.075
that new stretch one more time?

02:38.075 --> 02:39.701
It's the only one

02:38.075 --> 02:39.701
that I'm not sure of.

02:39.701 --> 02:40.828
Yeah, no problem. Um...

02:41.912 --> 02:43.413
Just start with him

02:43.413 --> 02:44.957
on his back...

02:43.413 --> 02:44.957
( Mateo cries )

02:44.957 --> 02:47.668
with a rolled towel under

02:44.957 --> 02:47.668
his neck for support.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.419
( crying intensifies )

02:49.419 --> 02:50.671
Just ignore him.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.798
Any attention rewards

02:50.671 --> 02:52.798
bad behavior.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.716
Okay, so, rolled towel.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.716
Right,

02:54.716 --> 02:56.635
( loud wailing )

02:54.716 --> 02:56.635
then he's gonna want to reach

02:56.635 --> 02:59.054
his right arm to his right toe,

02:56.635 --> 02:59.054
while keeping his core--

02:59.054 --> 03:00.097
Mateo! Shh!

03:00.097 --> 03:02.349
( screaming continues )

03:02.349 --> 03:03.433
Forget it.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.894
( Mateo quiets )

03:05.894 --> 03:06.937
Sorry.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.438
One more time,

03:06.937 --> 03:08.438
from the top.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.065
You're gonna have

03:08.438 --> 03:10.065
help at home, right?

03:10.065 --> 03:11.525
Oh, yeah, yeah,

03:10.065 --> 03:11.525
my-my grandma's

03:11.525 --> 03:12.734
a home health care worker.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.447
NARRATOR:

03:14.528 --> 03:17.447
<i>Oh... so, that's what</i>

03:14.528 --> 03:17.447
<i>all those smocks were about.</i>

03:17.447 --> 03:19.366
We will be staying

03:17.447 --> 03:19.366
with her and my mom

03:19.366 --> 03:21.160
for the first few weeks.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.661
Every newlywed's dream.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.329
For the record, all I need

03:24.329 --> 03:26.665
to feel like a newlywed

03:24.329 --> 03:26.665
is my sexy,

03:26.665 --> 03:29.250
sexy nurse.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.796
( heart monitor

03:29.250 --> 03:32.796
beeps increases )

03:32.796 --> 03:33.881
Whoa-ho!

03:32.796 --> 03:33.881
Hey, hey, hey,

03:33.881 --> 03:35.298
hey, hey.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.298
Hate to break

03:35.298 --> 03:37.009
the honeymoon up,

03:35.298 --> 03:37.009
but you're gonna need

03:37.009 --> 03:38.301
to keep that

03:37.009 --> 03:38.301
heart rate down

03:38.301 --> 03:39.845
for the next six

03:38.301 --> 03:39.845
weeks, remember?

03:40.929 --> 03:42.472
So, no sex?

03:42.472 --> 03:44.432
You can hardly move.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.432
She can.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.062
Be that as it may,

03:46.060 --> 03:48.062
for the next six weeks,

03:48.062 --> 03:49.146
it's hands...

03:50.438 --> 03:52.107
and everything else off.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.071
( bell clanging )

03:59.073 --> 04:00.782
Hi, Dad, bye, Dad.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.782
Mwah.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.409
Okay, so I'm going to go

04:00.782 --> 04:02.409
to the pharmacy

04:02.409 --> 04:04.703
and get your prescription

04:02.409 --> 04:04.703
filled, then I'm going to go

04:04.703 --> 04:06.663
to the house,

04:04.703 --> 04:06.663
make sure everything's ready,

04:06.663 --> 04:08.498
then I'll come back

04:06.663 --> 04:08.498
in about three hours

04:08.498 --> 04:10.417
to take you home... sound good?

04:10.417 --> 04:12.252
Mm-hmm.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.252
ROGELIO: No!

04:12.252 --> 04:16.423
Esteban is featured

04:12.252 --> 04:16.423
in this American magazine.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.800
I'll leave you two to discuss.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.260
He's in the "What's

04:18.800 --> 04:20.260
in My Bag" section.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.846
He's their first

04:20.260 --> 04:22.846
"What's in My Murse."

04:22.846 --> 04:24.932
My what?

04:22.846 --> 04:24.932
Murse.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.100
Male purse.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.517
That was my idea.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.108
He's not even original.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.068
Ashley Tisdale did vegan

04:34.108 --> 04:36.068
smoothie

04:36.068 --> 04:40.239
in a Mason jar

04:36.068 --> 04:40.239
in her bag months ago.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.282
I can't believe this...

04:40.239 --> 04:42.282
right after

04:42.282 --> 04:44.201
that stupid PSA went viral.

04:44.201 --> 04:47.913
NARRATOR:

04:44.201 --> 04:47.913
<i>Ah, yes, you'll recall</i>

04:44.201 --> 04:47.913
<i>Rogelio was recently arrested.</i>

04:47.913 --> 04:50.958
Urine swapping is no joke;

04:47.913 --> 04:50.958
it's a federal crime.

04:50.958 --> 04:57.172
Make no mistake: if you swap,

04:50.958 --> 04:57.172
<i>urine</i> big trouble.

04:57.172 --> 05:00.092
You mean the PP-SA?

04:57.172 --> 05:00.092
It's not funny!

05:00.092 --> 05:03.262
I'm-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:00.092 --> 05:03.262
My reputation took a hit.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.722
And now Esteban is

05:03.262 --> 05:05.722
featured in this magazine.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.390
Do you know what that means?

05:07.390 --> 05:12.187
He's on his way to becoming...

05:07.390 --> 05:12.187
a crossover star.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.355
I know you can't

05:12.187 --> 05:14.355
understand,

05:14.355 --> 05:16.733
but this feels like

05:14.355 --> 05:16.733
a shot to the heart.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.365
MICHAEL:

05:23.073 --> 05:24.365
<i>No, no, no.</i>

05:24.365 --> 05:25.826
No need to yell at anybody.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.244
Look, I get it.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.037
You took a hit.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.497
Just like...

05:30.497 --> 05:32.373
I took a hit.

05:32.373 --> 05:33.834
But if I can recover

05:32.373 --> 05:33.834
from a gunshot,

05:33.834 --> 05:37.629
you can recover from this.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.256
You are right.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.802
I'm coming for you...

05:43.802 --> 05:47.472
and your murse.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.974
Ew.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.101
Is he still sending you

05:48.974 --> 05:51.101
X-rated Snapchats?

05:51.101 --> 05:53.103
I had to delete the app.

05:53.103 --> 05:56.231
( in Spanish ):

05:53.103 --> 05:56.231
One more minute!

05:53.103 --> 05:56.231
Just cleaning up!

05:56.231 --> 05:57.691
( yawns loudly )

05:57.691 --> 05:58.984
I mean it, hon.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.027
You look exhausted.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.029
Again, thanks.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.029
I'm just saying

06:02.029 --> 06:04.614
if you're still having

06:02.029 --> 06:04.614
nightmares every night,

06:04.614 --> 06:06.700
talk to Michael,

06:04.614 --> 06:06.700
see if he'd consider

06:06.700 --> 06:08.743
not going back

06:06.700 --> 06:08.743
to the force.

06:08.743 --> 06:09.995
I don't want to.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.331
Work's not even

06:09.995 --> 06:12.331
on his radar yet.

06:12.331 --> 06:13.999
Okay, ready?

06:13.999 --> 06:16.084
NARRATOR:

06:13.999 --> 06:16.084
<i>Ah, yes, the Villanueva house,</i>

06:16.084 --> 06:18.628
<i>you'll recall, had flooded,</i>

06:18.628 --> 06:21.131
<i>resulting in a little</i>

06:18.628 --> 06:21.131
<i>remodeling, resulting in...</i>

06:21.131 --> 06:24.218
( in English ):

06:21.131 --> 06:24.218
Ta-da!

06:24.218 --> 06:26.220
<i>...that.</i>

06:26.220 --> 06:28.722
Ugh, I told you

06:26.220 --> 06:28.722
it was ugly

06:28.722 --> 06:31.225
and it looks even

06:28.722 --> 06:31.225
worse in person.

06:31.225 --> 06:34.144
( in Spanish ):

06:31.225 --> 06:34.144
Well, I think it looks great!

06:34.144 --> 06:36.230
Oh, you do not,

06:34.144 --> 06:36.230
you're just stubborn.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.564
Jane.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.564
Mm?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.233
It's awful, right?

06:39.233 --> 06:41.318
It's, uh...

06:42.736 --> 06:45.280
It-it-it's, uh,

06:42.736 --> 06:45.280
def-definitely bold...

06:45.280 --> 06:48.075
and, but

06:45.280 --> 06:48.075
on the whole, eh?

06:50.244 --> 06:53.872
( in Spanish ):

06:50.244 --> 06:53.872
What is this bill? Did you

06:50.244 --> 06:53.872
go to the doctor, Xiomara?

06:53.872 --> 06:55.414
Oh, um...

06:55.414 --> 06:57.500
Remember when I had

06:55.414 --> 06:57.500
the stomach flu a few weeks ago?

06:57.500 --> 07:00.795
NARRATOR:

06:57.500 --> 07:00.795
<i>To clarify, Xo didn't have a</i>

06:57.500 --> 07:00.795
<i>stomach flu a few weeks ago.</i>

07:00.795 --> 07:02.297
<i>She had a medication abortion,</i>

07:02.297 --> 07:04.465
<i>which caused cramps,</i>

07:02.297 --> 07:04.465
<i>which she told her mother</i>

07:04.465 --> 07:05.967
<i>was a stomach flu.</i>

07:05.967 --> 07:07.468
Oh, yeah, didn't I tell

07:05.967 --> 07:07.468
you I went to the doctor?

07:07.468 --> 07:08.720
No.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.680
Whoa, wallpaper.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.640
( in Spanish ):

07:10.680 --> 07:12.640
You better get used to it!

07:12.640 --> 07:13.975
Yes. Done.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.975
Used to it.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.105
Any tantrums today?

07:18.105 --> 07:19.940
So many tantrums today.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.441
I, uh...

07:19.940 --> 07:21.441
It's my fault.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.484
I know I'm supposed

07:21.441 --> 07:23.484
to ignore him, but...

07:23.484 --> 07:26.238
he just throws down

07:23.484 --> 07:26.238
at the worst times.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.822
I know. He does

07:26.238 --> 07:27.822
it to me, too,

07:27.822 --> 07:29.449
but listen, I called

07:27.822 --> 07:29.449
the pediatrician.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.368
You did?

07:31.368 --> 07:34.246
NARRATOR:

07:31.368 --> 07:34.246
<i>Weird. They usually</i>

07:31.368 --> 07:34.246
<i>discuss calls first.</i>

07:34.246 --> 07:36.331
She said it could be

07:34.246 --> 07:36.331
because his routine is off.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.375
And we have been

07:36.331 --> 07:38.375
trading days like crazy.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.877
I know, I know.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.877
No, it's me, too.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.712
I've been all over the

07:40.877 --> 07:42.712
place with the schedule.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.465
But she suggested that we

07:42.712 --> 07:45.465
get him back into a routine.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.384
Done. Up at 7:00.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.094
Nap time at 1:00,

07:47.384 --> 07:49.094
bedtime at 8:00.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.720
Perfect.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.720
And I'll start taking him

07:50.720 --> 07:52.389
to the Parent and Me again

07:50.720 --> 07:52.389
at the preschool.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.891
Great. Let's just make

07:52.389 --> 07:54.891
sure we still love it.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.268
Why wouldn't we?

07:56.268 --> 07:58.186
I just want to make sure.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.773
I'm gonna text Petra, tell

07:58.186 --> 08:01.773
her to cover my meetings.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.442
<i>As a reminder, friends,</i>

08:03.442 --> 08:05.526
<i>Petra couldn't cover any</i>

08:03.442 --> 08:05.526
<i>meetings since she'd been...</i>

08:05.526 --> 08:08.113
ANEZKA:

08:05.526 --> 08:08.113
<i>Don't tell me</i>

08:05.526 --> 08:08.113
<i>to calm down, Mother.</i>

08:08.113 --> 08:10.198
NARRATOR:

08:08.113 --> 08:10.198
<i>This is who would</i>

08:08.113 --> 08:10.198
<i>cover the meetings.</i>

08:10.198 --> 08:13.076
I just got text from Rafael,

08:10.198 --> 08:13.076
saying I'm supposed to go

08:13.076 --> 08:16.621
to Miami-Dade County Permitting

08:13.076 --> 08:16.621
and Inspection Center.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.166
Okay, so you go to the meeting,

08:19.166 --> 08:20.917
and if you do not

08:19.166 --> 08:20.917
have the answer,

08:20.917 --> 08:23.295
you just act above

08:20.917 --> 08:23.295
everybody else, okay?

08:23.295 --> 08:24.338
Now think.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.632
What would real Petra do?

08:27.632 --> 08:30.469
NARRATOR:

08:27.632 --> 08:30.469
<i>Oh.</i>

08:30.469 --> 08:31.511
ANEZKA:

08:30.469 --> 08:31.511
No, no.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.096
I'm done.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.096
What?

08:33.096 --> 08:34.473
Two weeks.

08:34.473 --> 08:36.224
Once I got something

08:34.473 --> 08:36.224
to blackmail him with,

08:36.224 --> 08:38.059
I was supposed to get his money

08:36.224 --> 08:38.059
and leave town.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.020
I was only supposed to be here

08:38.059 --> 08:40.020
for two more weeks.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.062
How was I supposed to know

08:41.062 --> 08:42.563
he would turn himself in

08:42.563 --> 08:44.232
for that insider training crap?

08:44.232 --> 08:46.693
I can't do this anymore, Mother.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.159
You are not selling couches!

08:52.240 --> 08:54.159
Please stop

08:54.159 --> 08:56.536
screaming at me. This is very

08:54.159 --> 08:56.536
stressful situation.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.206
I am sorry, Anezka.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.208
But you can do this.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.543
You just have to find something

09:01.208 --> 09:03.543
else to blackmail him with.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.253
Okay?

09:05.253 --> 09:08.465
JANE:

09:05.253 --> 09:08.465
Okay. Let me

09:05.253 --> 09:08.465
just call Michael.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.177
So do you think

09:10.342 --> 09:12.177
she bought it...

09:12.177 --> 09:13.761
about the medical bill?

09:12.177 --> 09:13.761
Yes, totally.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.180
'Cause I'm not sure.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.180
Uh, hey, babe.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.681
Yeah, I'm leaving

09:15.180 --> 09:16.681
the house now.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.309
Hey, uh, I was just about

09:16.681 --> 09:19.309
to call you, actually.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.311
Can you give me

09:19.309 --> 09:21.311
another half hour?

09:21.311 --> 09:22.687
Detective Olivia just got here,

09:22.687 --> 09:24.772
and we're going over

09:22.687 --> 09:24.772
some case stuff.

09:24.772 --> 09:28.360
NARRATOR:

09:24.772 --> 09:28.360
<i>Huh. Guess work is</i>

09:24.772 --> 09:28.360
<i>on his radar after all.</i>

09:28.360 --> 09:31.321
Of course, no problem.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.321
See you soon.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.782
He's with his new boss

09:31.321 --> 09:34.782
going over case stuff.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.782
Hmm.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.868
It's fine. It doesn't

09:34.782 --> 09:36.868
necessarily mean he's thinking

09:36.868 --> 09:38.703
about going back to work soon.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.331
MICHAEL:

09:38.703 --> 09:41.331
<i>Of course I'm thinking about</i>

09:38.703 --> 09:41.331
<i>going back to work soon.</i>

09:41.331 --> 09:43.917
I mean, you know, not now--

09:41.331 --> 09:43.917
I'm still six weeks away

09:43.917 --> 09:46.211
from my physical,

09:43.917 --> 09:46.211
but when I start,

09:46.211 --> 09:47.587
I want to hit the ground

09:46.211 --> 09:47.587
running.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.340
What's wrong?

09:51.425 --> 09:53.343
Nothing.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.802
Um, so...

09:54.802 --> 09:56.388
Just so you know,

09:56.388 --> 09:59.224
when we get home, there is some

09:56.388 --> 09:59.224
major wallpaper drama.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.683
I got it.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.683
What-what's wrong?

10:02.269 --> 10:04.438
I'm just, uh...

10:04.438 --> 10:06.689
I'm thrown that you're

10:04.438 --> 10:06.689
thinking about working.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.899
It's six weeks away.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.443
At all, I mean.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.569
Oh.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.737
I'm sorry.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.737
I-I-I'm just terrified.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.364
Mateo was kidnapped,

10:12.737 --> 10:14.364
you were shot

10:14.364 --> 10:16.324
and the woman who did it

10:14.364 --> 10:16.324
is still out there.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.076
Exactly. And I want to

10:16.324 --> 10:18.076
put her behind bars.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.454
Yeah, but why you?

10:20.454 --> 10:22.372
Can't it be anybody else?

10:22.372 --> 10:24.165
No one knows the

10:22.372 --> 10:24.165
case better than me.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.584
Your own partner shot you.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.253
I'm sorry.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.379
That came out wrong.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.838
It's jus that

10:29.379 --> 10:30.838
she targeted us twice.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.257
A-and I would never ask you

10:32.257 --> 10:34.092
except that you had offered

10:32.257 --> 10:34.092
to quit once before.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.261
That's different. I was afraid

10:34.092 --> 10:36.261
I was going to lose you.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.637
Are you saying I'm

10:36.261 --> 10:37.637
gonna lose you?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.389
No, of course not.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.389
We're married.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.932
Exactly. And you

10:39.389 --> 10:40.932
married a cop.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.517
Okay, it's time to get

10:40.932 --> 10:42.517
our newlyweds home.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.144
NARRATOR:

10:42.517 --> 10:44.144
<i>On the bright side,</i>

10:44.144 --> 10:46.104
<i>at least no one's thinking</i>

10:44.144 --> 10:46.104
<i>about having sex.</i>

10:49.232 --> 10:53.278
( in Spanish ):

10:49.232 --> 10:53.278
Goodnight, Michael.

10:49.232 --> 10:53.278
Night, Jane.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.405
Nighty-night, you two.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.618
Living the dream.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.702
Hey, hey.

11:01.702 --> 11:04.872
Come here,

11:01.702 --> 11:04.872
come here.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.124
( moans )

11:06.124 --> 11:08.460
This is exactly what

11:06.124 --> 11:08.460
I dreamed of.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.378
I'm sorry about before.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.089
I didn't mean to

11:10.378 --> 11:13.089
get defensive.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.089
No, no, no.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.174
I was just surprised.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.176
Well, look,

11:14.174 --> 11:16.176
I was thinking...

11:16.176 --> 11:20.096
Of course I'd quit if you

11:16.176 --> 11:20.096
couldn't live with it.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.473
I can't ask you

11:20.096 --> 11:21.473
to do that.

11:21.473 --> 11:25.519
But I would if

11:21.473 --> 11:25.519
it comes to that.

11:25.519 --> 11:29.189
But the truth is, it's

11:25.519 --> 11:29.189
still six weeks away.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.316
A lot can change

11:29.189 --> 11:31.316
in six weeks.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.611
You know, I mean,

11:31.316 --> 11:34.611
six weeks ago,

11:34.611 --> 11:36.154
I could barely sit up.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.864
And now I'm walking.

11:37.864 --> 11:42.118
Like Charlie Chaplin,

11:37.864 --> 11:42.118
but I'm walking.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.870
Recovery's a process.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.373
Okay, let's just both see

11:43.870 --> 11:46.373
how we feel with more time.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.790
JANE:

11:46.373 --> 11:47.790
<i>I feel like a monster.</i>

11:47.790 --> 11:50.210
I mean, Michael's the one

11:47.790 --> 11:50.210
who got shot,

11:50.210 --> 11:51.294
and he's comforting me?

11:51.294 --> 11:53.588
Hey. You had a trauma, too.

11:53.588 --> 11:54.839
Well, I have to get over it.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.341
I'm going to.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.341
I've done some research.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.259
NARRATOR:<i> Obviously.</i>

11:56.341 --> 11:58.259
And it says,

11:58.259 --> 12:01.221
that you have to face your

11:58.259 --> 12:01.221
fears, so I'll...

12:01.221 --> 12:03.139
walk the Marbella hallway,

12:01.221 --> 12:03.139
I guess.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.849
<i>It's important to note,</i>

12:04.849 --> 12:07.060
<i>that she had not been able</i>

12:04.849 --> 12:07.060
<i>to do so since the shooting.</i>

12:07.060 --> 12:09.145
And it says to try to get back

12:07.060 --> 12:09.145
into a routine,

12:09.145 --> 12:12.023
which, luckily, is exactly what

12:09.145 --> 12:12.023
I'm working on with Mateo,

12:12.023 --> 12:13.650
so that's that.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.864
<i>And for the record,</i>

12:16.986 --> 12:19.864
<i>that was that.</i>

12:19.864 --> 12:21.908
( happy music playing )

12:25.245 --> 12:28.122
( yawning )

12:28.122 --> 12:29.748
( mimics airplane buzzing )

12:29.748 --> 12:31.125
( laughs )

12:31.125 --> 12:33.420
( sighs )

12:35.963 --> 12:37.131
Mmm.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.175
( sighs )

12:39.175 --> 12:41.553
ROGELIO:

12:39.175 --> 12:41.553
<i>Can I just say,</i>

12:39.175 --> 12:41.553
<i>I hate montages?</i>

12:41.553 --> 12:44.097
It's a cheap ploy.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.225
No. It's a useful way to

12:44.097 --> 12:47.225
convey the passage of time

12:47.225 --> 12:48.727
as you inspire Emma Lazarus

12:48.727 --> 12:50.353
to write her poem

12:50.353 --> 12:52.146
for the base of the

12:50.353 --> 12:52.146
Statue of Liberty.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.273
Who wants useful?

12:53.273 --> 12:54.941
I want inspired.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.484
I want transcendent.

12:56.484 --> 12:59.320
I want a vegan smoothie--

12:56.484 --> 12:59.320
someone please.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.489
You. In a mason jar.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.950
<i>Ay.</i> Hey, Rogelio,

13:01.489 --> 13:03.950
what is going on

13:03.950 --> 13:06.119
with you today?

13:03.950 --> 13:06.119
You seem out of sorts.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.955
I'm sorry. I'm just waiting

13:06.119 --> 13:08.955
for a call from my agent.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.708
I heard there might

13:08.955 --> 13:11.708
be a three episode arc

13:11.708 --> 13:13.752
coming up on<i> Hawaii Five-O.</i>

13:11.708 --> 13:13.752
Mm.

13:13.752 --> 13:17.213
I'm looking to make the leap

13:13.752 --> 13:17.213
from, you know, telenovelas.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.506
Hmm. Good luck.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.509
Thank you.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.509
Fingers crossed.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.720
Back to the montage.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.764
( happy music playing )

13:29.142 --> 13:30.685
Is cane-walking

13:29.142 --> 13:30.685
an Olympic sport?

13:30.685 --> 13:33.146
Because if it is, I'm

13:30.685 --> 13:33.146
signing you up, baby.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.898
USA! USA!

13:33.146 --> 13:35.898
Yeah.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.776
NARRATOR:

13:35.898 --> 13:37.776
<i>Anyway, you get the idea.</i>

13:37.776 --> 13:40.236
<i>The routine part</i>

13:37.776 --> 13:40.236
<i>was going great.</i>

13:40.236 --> 13:41.946
( elevator bell dings )

13:52.749 --> 13:55.794
( gasps )

13:52.749 --> 13:55.794
XIOMARA:<i> You'll get there.</i>

13:55.794 --> 13:59.547
ALBA ( in Spanish ):

13:55.794 --> 13:59.547
All right, I'm headed to church.

13:59.547 --> 14:03.884
Are you sure you don't want

13:59.547 --> 14:03.884
to come with me?

14:03.884 --> 14:05.345
Yes, I'm sure.

14:08.723 --> 14:09.932
XIOMARA:

14:08.723 --> 14:09.932
<i>She knows.</i>

14:09.932 --> 14:11.768
I'm telling you

14:09.932 --> 14:11.768
this happened

14:11.768 --> 14:13.353
when she first found

14:11.768 --> 14:13.353
out I was having sex.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.730
She dropped hints

14:13.353 --> 14:15.730
and tortured me

14:15.730 --> 14:18.274
until I finally couldn't take

14:15.730 --> 14:18.274
it anymore and confessed.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.567
Okay, calm down, Cersei.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.068
Abuela always asks you

14:19.567 --> 14:21.068
to go to church.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.403
Twice in one day?

14:22.403 --> 14:24.322
MICHAEL:

14:22.403 --> 14:24.322
Plus, there was

14:22.403 --> 14:24.322
the tampon thing.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.993
Exactly. Don't forget

14:26.574 --> 14:28.993
about the tampon thing.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.953
She has asked you if you'd

14:28.993 --> 14:30.953
needed tampons before.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.706
You didn't tell me that.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.706
It wasn't important

14:32.706 --> 14:34.165
because it was the

14:32.706 --> 14:34.165
way she said it.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.333
It is important.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.043
We need to be methodical

14:35.333 --> 14:37.043
about this.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.461
Tampons go into

14:37.043 --> 14:38.461
the unknown column.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.046
No jumping

14:38.461 --> 14:40.046
to conclusions.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.464
We need facts.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.464
Yes.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.174
Good. We need your

14:41.464 --> 14:43.174
detective skills.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.051
NARRATOR:

14:43.174 --> 14:45.051
<i>Ooh, touchy subject.</i>

14:45.051 --> 14:46.511
What would you do

14:45.051 --> 14:46.511
if Alba was a perp?

14:46.511 --> 14:48.095
I'd probably drop

14:46.511 --> 14:48.095
the word "abortion."

14:48.095 --> 14:49.222
See how she reacts.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.348
No way. She'll know.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.641
Abort.

14:51.641 --> 14:54.060
Good thinking.

14:51.641 --> 14:54.060
I'll drop "abort."

14:54.060 --> 14:55.978
Okay. I got to get Mateo

14:54.060 --> 14:55.978
up from his nap,

14:55.978 --> 14:57.480
so we are not late

14:55.978 --> 14:57.480
for his class.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.191
Hopefully, Rafael still likes

14:57.480 --> 15:00.191
the preschool.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.193
Uh, he will. He's just

15:00.191 --> 15:02.193
pushing back a little

15:02.193 --> 15:03.944
because, you know, he's

15:02.193 --> 15:03.944
still in love with you.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.239
( chuckles )

15:03.944 --> 15:06.239
And you're

15:03.944 --> 15:06.239
married to someone else.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.783
That's ridiculous.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.783
He's not still in love with me.

15:08.783 --> 15:09.950
He definitely is.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.745
I'm leaving for Mateo's class.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.165
NARRATOR:

15:14.247 --> 15:16.165
<i>Ah, yes, Mateo's class,</i>

15:16.165 --> 15:17.834
<i>which meant Rafael was out,</i>

15:17.834 --> 15:20.294
<i>which meant Anezka</i>

15:17.834 --> 15:20.294
<i>had exactly two hours.</i>

15:20.294 --> 15:22.380
( door opens )

15:24.382 --> 15:27.009
Ms. Solano?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.515
What are you doing here?

15:32.515 --> 15:35.351
Mr. Solano wanted me to drop

15:32.515 --> 15:35.351
something off in his office.

15:35.351 --> 15:38.020
He said there wouldn't

15:35.351 --> 15:38.020
be anybody here,

15:38.020 --> 15:40.273
so, what are you doing here?

15:40.273 --> 15:44.235
Well... after the whole

15:40.273 --> 15:44.235
insider trading scandal,

15:44.235 --> 15:46.404
I don't trust Rafael with

15:44.235 --> 15:46.404
the finances anymore.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.906
Wanted to take a

15:46.404 --> 15:47.906
look for myself.

15:47.906 --> 15:50.032
I'll have to ask

15:47.906 --> 15:50.032
Mr. Solano about that.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.743
No!

15:51.743 --> 15:54.287
<i>Easy there, Anezka. Remember...</i>

15:57.624 --> 16:02.420
No, I... I don't think that

15:57.624 --> 16:02.420
will be necessary... Scott.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.345
( gasps )

16:10.052 --> 16:11.345
Oh.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.055
Ms. Solano?

16:13.055 --> 16:16.225
Mm. I think with what's

16:13.055 --> 16:16.225
about to happen,

16:16.225 --> 16:18.436
you can call me Petra.

16:19.938 --> 16:21.355
SCOTT ( sighs ):

16:19.938 --> 16:21.355
Oh!

16:19.938 --> 16:21.355
( sighs )

16:21.355 --> 16:22.982
Oh.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.067
I've always dreamed about

16:22.982 --> 16:25.067
having sex with you.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.361
That was better

16:25.067 --> 16:27.361
than my fantasies.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.196
( sniffs, sighs )

16:29.196 --> 16:31.324
And there were...

16:29.196 --> 16:31.324
a lot of 'em.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.033
( laughs )

16:31.324 --> 16:33.033
( sighs )

16:33.033 --> 16:35.411
Oh, that was

16:33.033 --> 16:35.411
the best sex of my life.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.748
ROGELIO ( in Spanish ):

16:35.411 --> 16:38.748
<i>Yes,</i>

16:35.411 --> 16:38.748
<i>making love changes things.</i>

16:38.748 --> 16:41.960
That's why I thought it might

16:38.748 --> 16:41.960
help with your writer's block,

16:41.960 --> 16:44.086
Emma Lazarus.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.086
( in Spanish ): Well,

16:44.086 --> 16:48.549
it was incredible,

16:44.086 --> 16:48.549
but sadly, right now,

16:48.549 --> 16:51.803
all I have for my poem is,

16:48.549 --> 16:51.803
"Welcome to America..."

16:51.803 --> 16:55.181
I understand. Look, when

16:51.803 --> 16:55.181
I came here, I was tired.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.933
I was poor.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.933
I was huddled.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.351
Just...

16:56.933 --> 16:58.351
yearning to breathe free.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.435
( phone rings, playing tune )

16:59.435 --> 17:00.979
( in English ):

16:59.435 --> 17:00.979
Whose is that?!

17:00.979 --> 17:04.649
Oh, it's mine!

17:00.979 --> 17:04.649
Everybody, shh!

17:04.649 --> 17:07.819
This could be about my

17:04.649 --> 17:07.819
big<i> Hawaii Five-O</i> arc!

17:07.819 --> 17:09.403
Shh!

17:09.403 --> 17:11.280
Hi there.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.866
ROGELIO:

17:11.280 --> 17:12.866
<i>Can you believe it's me</i>

17:12.866 --> 17:14.408
against Esteban

17:12.866 --> 17:14.408
for the part?!

17:14.408 --> 17:16.619
And they want

17:14.408 --> 17:16.619
me to audition!

17:16.619 --> 17:18.746
Is Esteban going

17:16.619 --> 17:18.746
to audition?

17:18.746 --> 17:21.374
Ah. Well...

17:18.746 --> 17:21.374
Then why won't you?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.583
Because I shouldn't have to!

17:22.583 --> 17:24.460
I've been in more

17:22.583 --> 17:24.460
hours of television,

17:24.460 --> 17:26.420
I've won more Palomas.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.422
Because you're the better actor,

17:26.420 --> 17:28.422
so go prove it.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.384
Well, it's not

17:28.422 --> 17:31.384
only that, no.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.136
My American accent might not

17:31.384 --> 17:34.136
actually be the greatest.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.429
Really?!

17:35.429 --> 17:37.264
Really.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.264
Try.

17:37.264 --> 17:42.812
( in a strange accent ):

17:37.264 --> 17:42.812
I would prefer<i> not</i> to try.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.481
All right, come on,

17:42.812 --> 17:45.481
don't make a joke.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.233
That was my try.

17:47.233 --> 17:51.153
Okay, well,

17:47.233 --> 17:51.153
I'll help you with the accent.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.446
Really?

17:52.446 --> 17:54.365
Of course. I got the time.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.200
See you next time, Mateo.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.200
God bless.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.662
Okay. So that was fun, huh?

17:59.662 --> 18:01.288
Mateo still loves it.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.957
Yeah, and the group's fine.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.957
Mm.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.417
But here's the thing.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.711
I don't want to enroll

18:04.417 --> 18:06.711
him here for preschool.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.629
Why? We decided months ago.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.590
I know. Well, I

18:08.629 --> 18:10.590
changed my mind.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.800
It's a little too

18:10.590 --> 18:12.800
Jesus-y for me.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.428
It is not Jesus-y.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.476
It's a Catholic preschool.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.476
What do you expect?

18:22.476 --> 18:24.938
I wasn't really thinking.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.938
I just went along with it.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.647
But now, things are different.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.191
Why? What changed?

18:29.191 --> 18:32.445
<i>At this moment, friends, she</i>

18:29.191 --> 18:32.445
<i>thought about her mom's words.</i>

18:32.445 --> 18:35.489
Okay. Fine. I wasn't planning

18:32.445 --> 18:35.489
on making, like,

18:35.489 --> 18:39.577
a big declaration or anything,

18:35.489 --> 18:39.577
but the truth is...

18:39.577 --> 18:41.579
<i>Maybe Rafael</i> was<i> still</i>

18:39.577 --> 18:41.579
<i>in love with her.</i>

18:41.579 --> 18:43.372
...I'm finally over you.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.999
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

18:44.999 --> 18:47.501
Oh. Well...

18:47.501 --> 18:49.712
c-congratulations.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.380
Thank you.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.507
Oh. It actually feels good.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.507
Really good.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.593
'Cause it took so long,

18:53.507 --> 18:55.593
you know?

18:55.593 --> 18:56.803
Yeah, totally.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.304
And that kind of changed things,

18:58.304 --> 19:00.306
because, the truth is,

18:58.304 --> 19:00.306
when I was in love with you,

19:00.306 --> 19:02.100
I just wanted to please you.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.310
I mean, I would wake up

19:02.100 --> 19:04.310
every morning and think,

19:04.310 --> 19:06.896
"What would Jane want? Like,

19:04.310 --> 19:06.896
what would make Jane happy?

19:06.896 --> 19:08.606
What would make

19:06.896 --> 19:08.606
Jane smile?"

19:08.606 --> 19:10.232
And now, I'm kind of like,

19:10.232 --> 19:11.609
"Oh, so what if Jane's upset?"

19:11.609 --> 19:13.069
I mean, no offense.

19:13.069 --> 19:16.072
No. No, no, none taken.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.783
Uh... so, what now?

19:18.783 --> 19:21.577
Now we'll start looking

19:18.783 --> 19:21.577
for new schools

19:21.577 --> 19:23.245
that speak to the both of us.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.414
Ah.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.213
( sighs )

19:37.426 --> 19:39.178
Now there is a wait-list

19:37.426 --> 19:39.178
for every Parent and Me

19:39.178 --> 19:40.680
that feed

19:39.178 --> 19:40.680
into a good preschool.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.807
I thought I had this settled.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.807
ALBA: Xiomara?

19:42.807 --> 19:45.559
( in Spanish ):

19:42.807 --> 19:45.559
You said you were going

19:42.807 --> 19:45.559
to pick up salads for dinner.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.686
Oh, right.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.355
Um, actually,

19:46.686 --> 19:49.355
I decided to...

19:49.355 --> 19:51.524
<i>abort</i> that plan

19:51.524 --> 19:53.693
and order Chinese

19:51.524 --> 19:53.693
food instead.

19:56.112 --> 19:58.197
Anyway, it'll

19:56.112 --> 19:58.197
be here soon.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.159
Then I'm going

19:58.197 --> 20:01.159
to take a little walk

20:01.159 --> 20:04.037
to make space for

20:01.159 --> 20:04.037
a heavier meal than I expected.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.747
( phone buzzing )

20:06.747 --> 20:08.708
Hello.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.708
So do you think she knows?

20:08.708 --> 20:11.836
Oh, yes. Good. Uh, yeah,

20:08.708 --> 20:11.836
I was calling to see

20:11.836 --> 20:14.964
if you had any slots left

20:11.836 --> 20:14.964
in your Parent and Me?

20:14.964 --> 20:16.465
Oh, you're all filled up?

20:16.465 --> 20:18.009
Okay, thank you.

20:18.009 --> 20:20.594
So what do you think?

20:18.009 --> 20:20.594
Oh, Mom, please stop!

20:20.594 --> 20:22.638
If you want to know if

20:20.594 --> 20:22.638
Abuela knows, just ask her!

20:22.638 --> 20:24.431
ALBA:

20:22.638 --> 20:24.431
Ask me what?

20:24.431 --> 20:25.683
( whispers ):

20:24.431 --> 20:25.683
I'm sorry.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.810
It's nothing.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.646
What's going on with you,

20:27.810 --> 20:30.646
Xiomara?

20:30.646 --> 20:33.733
You've been

20:30.646 --> 20:33.733
acting weird all week.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.573
I had an abortion, Mom.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.701
And I didn't know

20:40.573 --> 20:43.701
if you knew.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.166
NARRATOR:

20:47.747 --> 20:50.166
<i>I guess she didn't know.</i>

20:50.166 --> 20:53.586
MAGDA:

20:50.166 --> 20:53.586
<i>Okay, so you had</i>

20:50.166 --> 20:53.586
<i>another setback.</i>

20:53.586 --> 20:54.628
Just stay calm.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.963
How? There is new security

20:55.963 --> 20:57.548
on his computer, Mother!

20:57.548 --> 21:00.634
Scott says it's on<i> all</i>

20:57.548 --> 21:00.634
hotel computers. Scott says...

21:00.634 --> 21:02.636
Who the hell is Scott?

21:02.636 --> 21:04.055
He... works at hotel,

21:04.055 --> 21:06.515
he wears these cute

21:04.055 --> 21:06.515
little vests.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.850
And he's really sweet actually.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.393
Ugh.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.937
Petra hated that loser!

21:12.105 --> 21:13.981
No boys, sweetheart.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.234
You need to stay focused.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.902
Remember old saying--

21:17.902 --> 21:20.780
You chase two rabbits,

21:17.902 --> 21:20.780
you get neither.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.157
Now, listen, I want you

21:23.157 --> 21:26.244
to try his personal laptop.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.830
Okay, so my mom is going

21:27.787 --> 21:29.830
to pick you up for physical

21:29.830 --> 21:31.082
therapy and bring you back here.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.708
I should be home by lunch.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.708
Don't forget

21:32.708 --> 21:34.835
your medicine, and you

21:32.708 --> 21:34.835
still owe me 15 hamstring

21:34.835 --> 21:36.587
stretches from this morning.

21:36.587 --> 21:39.632
Got it.

21:36.587 --> 21:39.632
I love you, Mom.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.634
NARRATOR:

21:39.632 --> 21:41.634
<i>Did he just call her...?</i>

21:41.634 --> 21:44.553
Mama. My hot mama.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.681
NARRATOR:

21:44.553 --> 21:47.681
<i>Yeah, that's not</i>

21:44.553 --> 21:47.681
<i>making it better.</i>

21:47.681 --> 21:50.143
Okay. I love you too.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.813
Look, it's-it's

21:51.978 --> 21:53.813
really not that weird.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.648
I really don't

21:53.813 --> 21:55.648
want to discuss it.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.733
I'm just saying, okay?

21:55.648 --> 21:57.733
It's not a big deal.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.610
I know it's not a big deal.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.610
That's why I don't want

21:59.610 --> 22:01.487
to discuss it. Radio?

21:59.610 --> 22:01.487
No, no.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.530
Just, now that I am no

22:01.487 --> 22:03.530
longer in love with you,

22:03.530 --> 22:05.532
we've entered a new phase

22:03.530 --> 22:05.532
of our relationship.

22:05.532 --> 22:07.326
Okay, this is the

22:05.532 --> 22:07.326
friendship phase,

22:07.326 --> 22:10.913
which means that we can

22:07.326 --> 22:10.913
talk about this stuff.

22:10.913 --> 22:14.167
Okay, tonight...

22:10.913 --> 22:14.167
when you get home,

22:14.167 --> 22:18.921
forget about the pills and

22:14.167 --> 22:18.921
the exercises and the schedules,

22:18.921 --> 22:22.925
and just... you know.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.888
Yeah, I get it.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.431
And while that is sound advice,

22:29.431 --> 22:32.476
unfortunately, we can't

22:29.431 --> 22:32.476
do that at the moment.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.352
Because of his recovery.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.897
So, wait. You guys

22:34.352 --> 22:36.897
still haven't...?

22:34.352 --> 22:36.897
Mm.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.900
So you're a married virgin?

22:39.900 --> 22:41.861
I am, yes.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.863
A married virgin

22:41.861 --> 22:43.863
with a one-year old son.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.572
( laughs )

22:45.572 --> 22:47.658
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.658
No, it's ridiculous, and so is

22:47.658 --> 22:49.327
discussing this with you!

22:47.658 --> 22:49.327
No, I told you.

22:49.327 --> 22:50.828
I'm over you.

22:49.327 --> 22:50.828
Yes. Yes, I know.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.163
I repulse you.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.163
No. Look...

22:52.163 --> 22:53.664
You don't have

22:52.163 --> 22:53.664
to keep saying it.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.541
I'm sorry.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.541
It was just a...

22:55.541 --> 22:58.376
It was a long recovery.

23:00.338 --> 23:03.883
So... what was the cure?

23:09.096 --> 23:10.639
So I had to get over it.

23:11.891 --> 23:15.186
Which is why we are here.

23:15.186 --> 23:17.813
NARRATOR:

23:15.186 --> 23:17.813
<i>Ah, yes. At Wincroft.</i>

23:17.813 --> 23:19.899
One of the most multicultural,

23:17.813 --> 23:19.899
multiethnic schools

23:19.899 --> 23:21.317
you'll find in

23:19.899 --> 23:21.317
all of Miami.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.569
It's definitely not

23:21.317 --> 23:23.569
economically diverse.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.696
Actually, a full 20%

23:23.569 --> 23:25.696
of the students are here

23:25.696 --> 23:28.074
on need-based scholarships.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.074
WOMAN: Now, here at Wincroft,

23:28.074 --> 23:30.034
all parents are also

23:28.074 --> 23:30.034
required to volunteer

23:30.034 --> 23:32.119
a certain number of hours

23:30.034 --> 23:32.119
a month at the school.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.996
Can we send our nannies?

23:33.996 --> 23:36.707
That's just one mom.

23:36.707 --> 23:39.085
<i>And speaking of another tense</i>

23:36.707 --> 23:39.085
<i>Mommy and Me...</i>

23:39.085 --> 23:41.003
How can you be

23:39.085 --> 23:41.003
so self-righteous about this?

23:41.003 --> 23:43.589
You told me to get an abortion

23:41.003 --> 23:43.589
when I was a teenager.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.966
( in Spanish ):

23:43.589 --> 23:45.966
And I've regretted it

23:43.589 --> 23:45.966
every day since.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.552
This is my fault.

23:48.552 --> 23:52.556
for putting it in your head

23:48.552 --> 23:52.556
that it was ever okay.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.933
Stop.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.851
I'm glad you told me that!

23:55.851 --> 23:58.520
It helped me choose

23:55.851 --> 23:58.520
to have Jane.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.522
And I have never regretted that,

23:58.520 --> 24:00.522
Mom.

24:00.522 --> 24:03.234
But at this stage

24:00.522 --> 24:03.234
in my life, I...

24:03.234 --> 24:06.570
don't want to be pregnant,

24:03.234 --> 24:06.570
and I don't want a baby.

24:06.570 --> 24:11.117
( in Spanish ):

24:06.570 --> 24:11.117
Then you shouldn't have

24:06.570 --> 24:11.117
gotten knocked up!

24:11.117 --> 24:13.953
Miss, your kid

24:11.117 --> 24:13.953
just bit my son.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.953
Hmm?

24:13.953 --> 24:16.956
He did?! Oh, my God!

24:16.956 --> 24:19.292
Well, what...

24:16.956 --> 24:19.292
what happened?

24:19.292 --> 24:20.334
I didn't see.

24:20.334 --> 24:21.794
Wait, what?

24:20.334 --> 24:21.794
My son

24:21.794 --> 24:23.003
has bite marks on his arm.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.546
Well, Mateo's

24:23.003 --> 24:24.546
never bitten anyone.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.215
He was sitting

24:24.546 --> 24:26.215
right next to him.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.842
Well, Jack was also sitting

24:26.215 --> 24:28.842
next to him. Maybe he bit him.

24:28.842 --> 24:31.429
( chuckles )

24:28.842 --> 24:31.429
Jack and my son

24:28.842 --> 24:31.429
are best friends.

24:31.429 --> 24:32.972
They spend all of

24:31.429 --> 24:32.972
their time together,

24:32.972 --> 24:34.807
and Jack would never do that.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.726
Really?

24:34.807 --> 24:37.726
Maybe you should ask your nanny.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.979
I see where your son gets

24:37.726 --> 24:39.979
his personality.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.399
You know what, lady, bite me.

24:43.399 --> 24:45.276
RAFAEL:<i> You sabotaged it.</i>

24:43.399 --> 24:45.276
I didn't.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.361
You would've never done

24:45.276 --> 24:47.361
that at the Catholic school.

24:47.361 --> 24:49.071
I was just standing up

24:47.361 --> 24:49.071
for our son, okay?

24:49.071 --> 24:52.116
Mateo doesn't b... Ow!

24:54.994 --> 24:56.078
I'm so sorry.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.542
XIOMARA:

25:00.540 --> 25:02.542
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what,

25:02.542 --> 25:04.253
I don't think I'm going to hell.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.046
( in Spanish ):

25:04.253 --> 25:06.046
You certainly booked a ticket!

25:06.046 --> 25:07.505
Enough! Stop!

25:06.046 --> 25:07.505
XIOMARA: I told her--

25:07.505 --> 25:09.216
( in Spanish ): She was just--

25:07.505 --> 25:09.216
No! No!

25:09.216 --> 25:11.344
Stop! I don't care! No more

25:09.216 --> 25:11.344
fighting in front of Mateo.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.511
In addition to his tantrums,

25:11.344 --> 25:13.511
he is now biting people.

25:13.511 --> 25:15.348
And he is not an aggressive kid.

25:13.511 --> 25:15.348
So we are all

25:15.348 --> 25:18.767
gonna stay calm around him

25:15.348 --> 25:18.767
from now on, understand?!

25:19.726 --> 25:22.355
Starting now.

25:22.355 --> 25:24.064
Look,

25:24.064 --> 25:26.359
I know how upset you are

25:26.359 --> 25:28.319
about the choice I made,

25:28.319 --> 25:29.527
but I made it

25:29.527 --> 25:31.155
and it's done.

25:31.155 --> 25:34.283
So can't we put this behind us

25:31.155 --> 25:34.283
and move forward?

25:35.575 --> 25:39.330
( in Spanish ):

25:35.575 --> 25:39.330
No, I can't do that.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.956
( scoffs softly )

25:40.956 --> 25:44.084
I'm spending the night

25:40.956 --> 25:44.084
at Rogelio's.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.378
Abuela, just...

25:45.378 --> 25:47.463
( in Spanish ):

25:45.378 --> 25:47.463
Not in front of the baby.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.048
( door opens )

25:49.048 --> 25:50.757
( door shuts )

25:50.757 --> 25:52.510
Give me him. I'm going

25:50.757 --> 25:52.510
to take him for a walk.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.224
Michael's waiting for you.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.854
( sighs )

26:03.854 --> 26:05.689
( gulls crying )

26:03.854 --> 26:05.689
( tropical music playing )

26:05.689 --> 26:09.485
Um, so we didn't get

26:05.689 --> 26:09.485
to go to Puerto Rico

26:09.485 --> 26:10.944
for our honeymoon,

26:10.944 --> 26:12.946
so this is...

26:10.944 --> 26:12.946
Well, it's not that.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.115
But something else

26:12.946 --> 26:15.115
that Rogelio

26:15.115 --> 26:17.284
and his telenovela crew

26:15.115 --> 26:17.284
put together.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.994
And, yes, he did pay them.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.247
Michael...

26:23.082 --> 26:25.543
I'm sorry about

26:23.082 --> 26:25.543
the mom thing.

26:25.543 --> 26:27.711
( groans, chuckles )

26:25.543 --> 26:27.711
It's just...

26:27.711 --> 26:31.882
we haven't had many

26:27.711 --> 26:31.882
newlywed moments, you know?

26:31.882 --> 26:35.177
So, the plan was

26:31.882 --> 26:35.177
to sip margaritas

26:35.177 --> 26:38.764
Ooh.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.764
and listen to my kickass

26:35.177 --> 26:38.764
honeymoon playlist.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.057
But now I'm thinking

26:40.057 --> 26:42.518
the most romantic thing

26:40.057 --> 26:42.518
for you might be

26:42.518 --> 26:44.602
to listen to my playlist

26:44.602 --> 26:47.481
while doing some research

26:44.602 --> 26:47.481
on why kids bite.

26:47.481 --> 26:50.650
NARRATOR:

26:47.481 --> 26:50.650
<i>I'm not gonna lie, it was just</i>

26:47.481 --> 26:50.650
<i>the most romantic thing</i>

26:50.650 --> 26:52.528
<i>he could say.</i>

26:52.528 --> 26:55.114
ROGELIO ( American accent ):

26:52.528 --> 26:55.114
<i>Dude, I love</i>

26:52.528 --> 26:55.114
<i>the ocean at night.</i>

26:55.114 --> 26:56.865
The waves are killer.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.743
And then she realizes

26:56.865 --> 26:59.743
I'm the killer.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.538
Well, your accent is getting

26:59.743 --> 27:02.538
so much better.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.956
Thanks, homegirl.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.166
I'm trying to stay

27:03.956 --> 27:06.166
in my American character.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.461
I'm going full Daniel Day-Lewis.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.047
Xo, what's bumming you out?

27:12.047 --> 27:14.716
( sighs )

27:12.047 --> 27:14.716
It's my mom.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.343
She's making me feel guilty.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.262
N-Not for the abortion.

27:18.262 --> 27:22.099
She's making me feel guilty

27:18.262 --> 27:22.099
about not feeling guilty.

27:22.099 --> 27:26.270
Well, get your mother out

27:22.099 --> 27:26.270
of your head.

27:26.270 --> 27:30.107
If you're sure about your

27:26.270 --> 27:30.107
choice, that's all that matters.

27:30.107 --> 27:32.151
Keep it real, brah.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.820
It's one of the things

27:32.151 --> 27:34.820
I admire most about you.

27:34.820 --> 27:35.821
Thanks.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.156
And could you maybe lose

27:37.156 --> 27:38.949
the American accent

27:38.949 --> 27:41.076
while you talk

27:38.949 --> 27:41.076
about authenticity?

27:41.076 --> 27:43.120
( speaking normally ):

27:41.076 --> 27:43.120
Yeah.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.956
So, why the sudden need

27:43.120 --> 27:45.956
to cross over to America?

27:45.956 --> 27:48.125
You're-you're at the top

27:45.956 --> 27:48.125
of the telenovela game.

27:48.125 --> 27:51.795
It's just that my telenovelas

27:48.125 --> 27:51.795
are the most popular in Mexico,

27:51.795 --> 27:54.089
where I'm like a Tom Cruise

27:51.795 --> 27:54.089
plus Justin Bieber

27:54.089 --> 27:56.758
plus Juanes

27:54.089 --> 27:56.758
all put together, no?

27:56.758 --> 27:59.637
But my home is not

27:56.758 --> 27:59.637
Mexico anymore.

27:59.637 --> 28:01.763
Because of Jane, Mateo,

28:01.763 --> 28:05.017
and, well, you,

28:05.017 --> 28:06.352
it's here.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.146
So now that I've crossed

28:06.352 --> 28:09.146
over to this family,

28:09.146 --> 28:12.065
I want to feel the amazing perks

28:09.146 --> 28:12.065
of fame in my new country.

28:12.065 --> 28:15.528
NARRATOR:

28:12.065 --> 28:15.528
<i>And, friends, that was just</i>

28:12.065 --> 28:15.528
<i>about the most romantic thing</i>

28:15.528 --> 28:16.945
<i>he could say.</i>

28:16.945 --> 28:20.115
What's it say?

28:16.945 --> 28:20.115
Well, general consensus says

28:20.115 --> 28:23.494
that kids bite because they are

28:20.115 --> 28:23.494
overwhelmed and uncertain

28:23.494 --> 28:26.038
and they don't have the words

28:23.494 --> 28:26.038
to express themselves.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.832
It's like this giant wave

28:26.038 --> 28:28.832
of tension that takes over

28:28.832 --> 28:31.835
and they can't stop

28:28.832 --> 28:31.835
it and they just...

28:31.835 --> 28:34.838
react without thinking.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.838
Mmm.

28:34.838 --> 28:37.257
Which is totally what

28:34.838 --> 28:37.257
I've been doing.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.676
What?

28:38.676 --> 28:42.262
Biting. W...

28:38.676 --> 28:42.262
Not actually biting.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.515
Just snapping at people.

28:44.515 --> 28:46.433
Like, a lot.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.060
My mom.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.436
The preschool lady.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.188
That guy at the gas station.

28:51.188 --> 28:53.273
Oh. What happened with

28:51.188 --> 28:53.273
the guy at the gas station?

28:53.273 --> 28:55.359
Let's just say that we both

28:53.273 --> 28:55.359
agreed that I should come back

28:55.359 --> 28:57.486
for an oil change another day.

28:55.359 --> 28:57.486
( chuckles )

28:57.486 --> 29:01.907
I think it's because

28:57.486 --> 29:01.907
I'm so uncertain.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.452
I need things settled.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.371
With me going back to work?

29:10.790 --> 29:13.293
( sighs ) I know you're

29:10.790 --> 29:13.293
just offering not to

29:13.293 --> 29:14.628
to make me happy.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.380
That's true.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.380
( chuckles )

29:17.423 --> 29:20.175
But that's no small thing.

29:20.175 --> 29:23.929
Yeah. But your happiness

29:20.175 --> 29:23.929
is no small thing to me.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.348
You know?

29:23.929 --> 29:26.348
So it's a draw there.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.309
Look, it-it's your job.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.478
So if you're telling me

29:29.309 --> 29:31.478
that you love it

29:31.478 --> 29:34.607
and that you're not scared

29:31.478 --> 29:34.607
and you want to go back,

29:34.607 --> 29:35.941
then that's that.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.234
But you have to say it,

29:37.234 --> 29:40.070
so that I can flip

29:37.234 --> 29:40.070
the switch and move on.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.782
I love my job

29:43.782 --> 29:46.201
and I'm not scared

29:46.201 --> 29:48.245
and I want to go back.

29:48.245 --> 29:50.748
( clicks tongue, sighs )

29:50.748 --> 29:52.666
Okay.

29:52.666 --> 29:55.794
( sniffles ) Great.

29:52.666 --> 29:55.794
So then you're going back.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.713
And you're wearing

29:55.794 --> 29:57.713
a bulletproof vest every day.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.089
( chuckles )

29:57.713 --> 29:59.089
I'm serious.

29:59.089 --> 30:01.550
Okay.

29:59.089 --> 30:01.550
And I'm dealing with it now.

30:01.550 --> 30:02.801
How, exactly?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.470
No, you don't have to worry.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.305
You know who said I

30:04.470 --> 30:06.305
don't have to worry?

30:06.305 --> 30:09.891
My mom, when my parents

30:06.305 --> 30:09.891
were getting divorced, okay?

30:09.891 --> 30:11.351
You're not my mom.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.937
You're my wife.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.189
Let me help you.

30:16.189 --> 30:19.359
( crying softly )

30:19.359 --> 30:21.570
I can't walk the halls.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.490
Where you were shot.

30:24.490 --> 30:28.410
I keep seeing you,

30:24.490 --> 30:28.410
lying there.

30:28.410 --> 30:31.580
We'll do it together, okay?

30:31.580 --> 30:34.458
God, this would be

30:31.580 --> 30:34.458
a great moment to have sex.

30:34.458 --> 30:38.378
I mean, at this point, it just

30:34.458 --> 30:38.378
seems like a big cosmic joke.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.589
( laughs )

30:45.678 --> 30:48.263
NARRATOR:

30:45.678 --> 30:48.263
<i>True to her word, on the day</i>

30:45.678 --> 30:48.263
<i>Jane flipped the switch</i>

30:48.263 --> 30:50.307
<i>and accepted that Michael</i>

30:48.263 --> 30:50.307
<i>was returning to work,</i>

30:50.307 --> 30:52.976
<i>she felt strangely... calm.</i>

30:52.976 --> 30:54.853
<i>Well, calmer.</i>

30:54.853 --> 30:56.772
<i>There was still the whole</i>

30:54.853 --> 30:56.772
<i>school debacle looming.</i>

30:56.772 --> 30:58.732
WOMAN:

30:56.772 --> 30:58.732
And our motto here is,

30:56.772 --> 30:58.732
we don't care

30:58.732 --> 31:02.027
if our kids leave here knowing

30:58.732 --> 31:02.027
their letters or their numbers.

31:02.027 --> 31:05.238
We care if they can

31:02.027 --> 31:05.238
name their feelings.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.782
Yeah, there's no way

31:05.238 --> 31:06.782
he's going here.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.033
Not a chance.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.326
How soon can we leave?

31:09.326 --> 31:11.953
Ooh. I just got an e-mail

31:09.326 --> 31:11.953
from Wincroft.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.955
What?

31:11.953 --> 31:13.955
I wrote them last night.

31:13.955 --> 31:16.249
Apologized.

31:13.955 --> 31:16.249
Basically ate dirt.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.877
Some of my best writing.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.877
Can you put your phone away?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.587
Why?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.587
It's a no phone zone.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.715
There's also a sign that says

31:20.587 --> 31:22.715
you can eat your boogers.

31:22.715 --> 31:24.383
Who cares?

31:22.715 --> 31:24.383
We don't even like this school.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.719
Holy crap! I fixed it!

31:24.383 --> 31:26.719
They invited Mateo

31:26.719 --> 31:28.595
to join the Parent and Me.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.595
I'm gonna reply now

31:28.595 --> 31:31.139
before someone snags our spot.

31:28.595 --> 31:31.139
Jane, will you wait? Stop.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.433
Why?

31:31.139 --> 31:33.433
'Cause I don't like

31:31.139 --> 31:33.433
Wincroft anymore.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.394
What? But that was your choice.

31:35.394 --> 31:38.188
I know. It was.

31:35.394 --> 31:38.188
But yesterday afternoon

31:38.188 --> 31:40.065
I got a call asking

31:38.188 --> 31:40.065
for a large donation

31:40.065 --> 31:41.817
if I wanted to make the whole

31:40.065 --> 31:41.817
biting incident go away.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.777
What?

31:41.817 --> 31:43.777
So obviously

31:41.817 --> 31:43.777
it's just not for us.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.071
Oh, my God. You weren't gonna

31:43.777 --> 31:46.071
tell me. Admit it.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.071
Jane...

31:46.071 --> 31:47.740
I would've...

31:46.071 --> 31:47.740
No, you wouldn't have!

31:47.740 --> 31:50.033
You were just gonna make me feel

31:47.740 --> 31:50.033
like I ruined it for him!

31:50.033 --> 31:53.328
WOMAN:

31:50.033 --> 31:53.328
Oopsie.

31:53.328 --> 31:56.415
( chuckles )

31:53.328 --> 31:56.415
I am so sorry.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.542
W-We know we should not be

31:56.415 --> 31:58.542
fighting in front of the kids.

31:58.542 --> 32:01.253
Oh, no, it's perfectly okay to

31:58.542 --> 32:01.253
fight in front of the kids.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.547
The key is, you also have

32:01.253 --> 32:03.547
to make up in front of them.

32:03.547 --> 32:06.174
That's how we model behavior.

32:03.547 --> 32:06.174
So...

32:07.801 --> 32:10.804
Sorry, dude.

32:07.801 --> 32:10.804
Okay. We good?

32:07.801 --> 32:10.804
My bad. Okay.

32:10.804 --> 32:14.224
( laughs )

32:10.804 --> 32:14.224
That's not how we do it here.

32:14.224 --> 32:16.769
Should we take them

32:14.224 --> 32:16.769
to the Compassion Corner?

32:16.769 --> 32:19.730
CHILDREN:

32:16.769 --> 32:19.730
Yeah!

32:21.607 --> 32:26.361
Go ahead. Mateo's Mommy,

32:21.607 --> 32:26.361
you're upset because...?

32:26.361 --> 32:30.156
I'm upset

32:26.361 --> 32:30.156
because Mateo's Daddy

32:30.156 --> 32:32.200
didn't tell me something

32:30.156 --> 32:32.200
he should have.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.202
And I should've.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.202
And next time I will.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.496
Cool. Forgiven.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.496
Great.

32:36.496 --> 32:37.456
So, so, so, let's get

32:37.456 --> 32:39.541
under those big feelings.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.042
Why didn't you tell

32:39.541 --> 32:41.042
Mateo's mom

32:41.042 --> 32:42.335
the truth?

32:43.503 --> 32:45.255
Because...

32:45.255 --> 32:47.257
I made a decision.

32:47.257 --> 32:49.092
The first one in a while.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.052
And I didn't want

32:49.092 --> 32:51.052
to lose credibility.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.679
I felt it was important not to.

32:52.679 --> 32:55.140
And Mateo's Mommy gets that.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.892
But it's also not fair.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.310
I know it's not.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.519
But it's also a new dynamic,

32:59.519 --> 33:01.062
and I want it to work.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.439
And it will.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.441
As long as you

33:02.439 --> 33:04.441
don't automatically turn

33:04.441 --> 33:06.025
against something

33:04.441 --> 33:06.025
because I want it.

33:06.025 --> 33:07.444
I just want to have a voice.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.571
And you have such a big family,

33:07.444 --> 33:09.571
you know?

33:09.571 --> 33:10.906
It's only me.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.950
Us.

33:12.950 --> 33:14.993
We're a family, too.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.204
But I get it.

33:18.204 --> 33:20.248
And I'm all for the new dynamic.

33:18.204 --> 33:20.248
I mean,

33:20.248 --> 33:22.417
I don't have to talk about

33:20.248 --> 33:22.417
my sex life with you again...

33:22.417 --> 33:23.543
Oh, nice job,

33:23.543 --> 33:25.420
Mommy and Daddy!

♪ We're better together,

33:25.420 --> 33:28.841

33:28.841 --> 33:31.635

33:33.720 --> 33:36.389
Hey, uh, before we go,

33:33.720 --> 33:36.389
quick question.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.892
How do you deal

33:36.389 --> 33:38.892
with biting?

33:38.892 --> 33:40.226
It's just a phase.

33:40.226 --> 33:41.854
And not your fault.

33:41.854 --> 33:44.564
But next time it happens,

33:41.854 --> 33:44.564
don't give him attention.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.692
Instead, comfort the victim.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.527
( chuckles )

33:49.486 --> 33:50.529
Hmm.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.405
We found a preschool!

33:52.405 --> 33:53.907
It's actually

33:52.405 --> 33:53.907
such a weird place.

33:53.907 --> 33:57.202
Totally hippy-dippy,

33:53.907 --> 33:57.202
but we ended up loving it.

33:57.202 --> 34:00.622
Oh... go say hi to Michael,

33:57.202 --> 34:00.622
sweetie. Go on.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.166
Where's Mom?

34:03.166 --> 34:06.378
( in Spanish ):

34:03.166 --> 34:06.378
Probably somewhere very hot.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.797
Come on, Abuela,

34:06.378 --> 34:08.797
don't be so stubborn.

34:08.797 --> 34:11.633
If there's one thing that I

34:08.797 --> 34:11.633
learned at Mateo's new school,

34:11.633 --> 34:14.553
it's that we should respect

34:11.633 --> 34:14.553
each other's differences.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.556
And agreeing to disagree

34:14.553 --> 34:17.556
is okay, too.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.141
Look. It's right here

34:17.556 --> 34:20.141
in this pamphlet.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.394
I'm telling you,

34:20.141 --> 34:22.394
it's a great school.

34:22.394 --> 34:23.520
MICHAEL:

34:22.394 --> 34:23.520
Ow!

34:24.730 --> 34:26.231
He bit me.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.107
NARRATOR:

34:26.231 --> 34:28.107
<i>Quick! Comfort the victim.</i>

34:28.107 --> 34:29.902
Oh. Wow, Michael.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.571
Are you okay?

34:32.571 --> 34:34.781
I'm supposed

34:32.571 --> 34:34.781
to comfort the victim.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.616
I'm so sorry

34:34.781 --> 34:36.616
that happened.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.618
That was really terrible,

34:38.618 --> 34:40.662
and you don't deserve that.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.374
<i>( dramatic music playing )</i>

34:44.374 --> 34:45.625
Michael...

34:45.625 --> 34:48.169

( sobs )

34:50.505 --> 34:52.841

34:50.505 --> 34:52.841
I'm sorry.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.509
What's going on?

34:54.509 --> 34:57.345
I don't know, I...

34:54.509 --> 34:57.345
( clears throat )

34:57.345 --> 35:00.640
I think I... I just

34:57.345 --> 35:00.640
suddenly realized that...

35:00.640 --> 35:02.475
( takes deep breath )

35:02.475 --> 35:04.185
...that I almost died.

35:09.315 --> 35:11.068
I don't know why

35:09.315 --> 35:11.068
this is happening right now.

35:11.068 --> 35:12.360
I guess it has something

35:12.360 --> 35:14.696
to do with walking in

35:12.360 --> 35:14.696
the hallway earlier.

35:16.489 --> 35:19.534
The victim thing.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.244
I thought I was fine.

35:21.244 --> 35:22.454
You are fine.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.414
And we'll get

35:22.454 --> 35:24.414
through this.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.249
Really?

35:24.414 --> 35:26.249
Mm-hmm.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.001
'Cause right now

35:26.249 --> 35:28.001
would be a good time

35:28.001 --> 35:29.795

40:07.864 --> 40:09.115
NARRATOR:

40:07.864 --> 40:09.115
<i>Ah...</i>

40:09.115 --> 40:10.909
<i>the mother-daughter bond.</i>

40:10.909 --> 40:12.369
<i>So sweet.</i>

40:12.369 --> 40:13.953
Don't call me stupid, Mother!

40:12.369 --> 40:13.953
I'm trying!

40:13.953 --> 40:15.580
NARRATOR:

40:13.953 --> 40:15.580
<i>Sometimes.</i>

40:16.706 --> 40:18.041
Everything okay, baby?

40:21.753 --> 40:23.171
Can I just say...

40:23.171 --> 40:25.590
I hate the way

40:23.171 --> 40:25.590
your mother treats you.

40:27.384 --> 40:30.428
NARRATOR:

40:27.384 --> 40:30.428
<i>Man, if you think Petra hated</i>

40:27.384 --> 40:30.428
<i>being frozen before,</i>

40:30.428 --> 40:32.597
<i>now people think</i>

40:30.428 --> 40:32.597
<i>she's sleeping with Scott.</i>

40:32.597 --> 40:36.351
Okay, listen, when you

40:32.597 --> 40:36.351
caught me in Rafael's office,

40:36.351 --> 40:39.437
I wasn't checking up

40:36.351 --> 40:39.437
on the hotel's finances.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.940
I-I was looking for dirt.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.359
To blackmail him with.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.568
That's what I assumed.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.112
And so<i> you</i> know,

40:47.112 --> 40:49.239
I've got dirt on everyone

40:47.112 --> 40:49.239
at the Marbella.

40:49.239 --> 40:50.656
I've been collecting it

40:49.239 --> 40:50.656
for years.

40:50.656 --> 40:53.159
It's my burn book, if you will.

40:53.159 --> 40:56.746
Including good stuff on Rafael.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.207
So...

40:59.207 --> 41:01.042
let's take him down

40:59.207 --> 41:01.042
together, baby.

NARRATOR:

41:11.594 --> 41:13.305
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

41:13.305 --> 41:15.974
<i>But before we get to that,</i>

41:13.305 --> 41:15.974
<i>a bit of good news.</i>

41:15.974 --> 41:19.477
I, uh, I feel like

41:15.974 --> 41:19.477
I'm making progress every day.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.562
Um, physically, mentally...

41:21.562 --> 41:23.148
And that shows

41:21.562 --> 41:23.148
in your test results.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.691
Now, I can't clear you

41:23.148 --> 41:25.691
for police duty

41:25.691 --> 41:27.902
for a few more weeks,

41:25.691 --> 41:27.902
but other than that,

41:27.902 --> 41:30.071
you can resume

41:27.902 --> 41:30.071
normal activities.

41:31.072 --> 41:33.616
All normal activities?

41:33.616 --> 41:35.701
Sex. Can we have sex?

41:35.701 --> 41:37.620
Oh. Y-Yes.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.956
I mean, don't do anything crazy,

41:37.620 --> 41:39.956
but y-yeah.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.458
Seriously?

41:39.956 --> 41:41.458
Really?

41:41.458 --> 41:42.875
I thought we were

41:41.458 --> 41:42.875
two weeks away still.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.502
You can wait if you'd prefer.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.837
No! We're good. Yes.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.837
No. No, thank you.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.713
Thank you so much, Doc.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.713
We'll be in touch.

41:50.467 --> 41:51.926
<i>They're actually gonna do it!</i>

41:51.926 --> 41:54.553
<i>Say good-bye</i>

41:51.926 --> 41:54.553
<i>to Jane the Virgin!</i>
