<i>[Miller]  Citizens of Pretty Lake,</i>

00:03.869 --> 00:07.304
<i>we have no choice but to
continue the quarantine.</i>

00:07.373 --> 00:09.574
It's not over, Gord. They lied to us!

00:09.641 --> 00:11.876
<i>[Melissa]  The Dukes are
patrolling the town with guns.</i>

00:11.943 --> 00:12.977
Someone's gonna get shot.

00:13.044 --> 00:14.444
- [gunshot]
- [groans]

00:14.512 --> 00:16.312
<i>[Gord]  You got your vigilantes.</i>

00:16.381 --> 00:17.581
I'm just trying to keep
everybody safe around here.

00:17.648 --> 00:19.016
You're not doing a very good job.

00:20.352 --> 00:22.286
If the power stays out,
maybe we have a chance.

00:22.354 --> 00:24.588
<i>You said yourself, we could
be stuck here for years.</i>

00:24.655 --> 00:26.123
Adam, don't!

00:26.191 --> 00:27.892
What the hell did you just do?

00:27.959 --> 00:29.459
Everything, including
our kiss, was a mistake.

00:29.527 --> 00:30.594
I was feeling sorry for you.

00:30.661 --> 00:32.396
Maybe you're not so bad.

00:32.463 --> 00:34.364
- Who are you?
- Santa Claus.

00:34.432 --> 00:35.899
<i>[Adam] Chuck's sister was murdered.</i>

00:35.966 --> 00:37.501
Hey, look at the footprints.

00:37.568 --> 00:39.870
I need your help. They think I killed Lana.

00:39.937 --> 00:41.304
<i>[Stacey]  What I have with Chuck is good.</i>

00:41.372 --> 00:42.806
<i>And I'm not gonna throw it away for you.</i>

00:42.874 --> 00:44.741
You were with Ronnie. I'm done with you.

00:44.809 --> 00:47.310
Put your guns down. Put them down!

00:47.378 --> 00:49.779
Never touch my sister again!

00:49.846 --> 00:52.282
Every day, I am looking after your baby.

00:52.349 --> 00:55.184
Trust me, you are not gonna
have to deal with me anymore!

00:55.252 --> 00:56.852
You can always stay at our place.

00:56.921 --> 00:58.587
- Why not?
- Why not?

01:01.526 --> 01:03.946
- [bell ringing]
- [children laughing]

01:05.265 --> 01:07.476
Find the next Hemingway
in any of those papers?

01:07.559 --> 01:09.645
Right now, I'm trying not to weep

01:09.728 --> 01:13.064
for the future of the English language
or my ability to teach it.

01:13.148 --> 01:15.567
These papers are awful.

01:16.735 --> 01:18.403
Okay, Evan!
Evan, stop.

01:18.487 --> 01:20.196
- What?
- I need to finish marking.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.323
- And besides, what if somebody walks in?
- [scoffs]

01:22.407 --> 01:26.411
Yeah, the fallout from the scandal
will ruin both our careers.

01:26.495 --> 01:28.038
[scoffs] I mean, can you imagine?

01:28.121 --> 01:31.625
"Teachers caught in rampant PDA
during school hours."

01:32.543 --> 01:34.419
Obviously,
you're well aware of the danger.

01:34.502 --> 01:36.004
[Ms. Symonds chuckles]

01:38.256 --> 01:41.301
Hey, uh, what...
What day is it?

01:41.384 --> 01:44.095
October 22nd, why?

01:44.179 --> 01:45.514
This is... this is terrible.

01:45.597 --> 01:47.182
It's your birthday.

01:47.265 --> 01:48.517
I... How could I have forgotten?

01:48.600 --> 01:50.644
It's okay.
Honestly, don't worry about it.

01:50.727 --> 01:52.521
Oh, no, I, uh...

01:52.604 --> 01:55.607
just remembered.
[chuckles]

01:58.401 --> 02:01.196
- Happy birthday.
- Evan!

02:01.279 --> 02:02.614
[Ms. Symonds chuckles]

02:04.282 --> 02:05.366
Yes.

02:05.450 --> 02:06.868
- [laughs]
- Really?

02:08.494 --> 02:10.705
- [choking]
- Evan?

Evan!

[Pat] It's a great breakfast.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.780
We should have you around more often.

02:43.864 --> 02:48.076
[laughs] Uh, thanks for having me at all.
Felt like I had to do something.

02:48.744 --> 02:50.370
- Ah, thanks.
- [baby gurgles]

02:53.539 --> 02:56.126
Oh, look at the little guy.

02:56.835 --> 02:58.336
Aw.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.505
What's his name?

03:01.840 --> 03:03.549
I haven't thought of one yet.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.263
Morning, Ronnie.

03:08.346 --> 03:09.848
Morning, everyone.

03:11.349 --> 03:12.392
Sleep well?

03:12.475 --> 03:14.770
Yeah, best one I've had in weeks.

03:14.853 --> 03:17.063
Yeah, it's that country air.

03:17.147 --> 03:18.356
You, uh...

03:19.733 --> 03:21.026
feel like going hunting?

03:21.735 --> 03:23.111
Seasons aren't open.

03:23.194 --> 03:26.782
Yeah, well, last time I checked,
all the game wardens are dead,

03:26.865 --> 03:29.660
communications are down,
can't go into town.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.827
So I'm going hunting.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.163
You'll thank me for the meat
if that quarantine isn't lifted.

03:35.206 --> 03:36.499
Well, I've never gone hunting before.

03:36.582 --> 03:38.293
I don't really think
I'd be useful to you.

03:38.376 --> 03:40.586
No, you'll be fine.
Come on, it'll be fun.

03:40.671 --> 03:43.089
Uh, I have the baby
and everything.

03:43.173 --> 03:44.590
Tracey can watch the baby.

03:45.801 --> 03:47.218
Uh, well, I was actually...

03:47.302 --> 03:49.012
And suddenly you don't like babies?
Is that...

03:49.095 --> 03:51.807
- No, it's not that. I just... I was...
- Great.

03:51.890 --> 03:53.474
Tracey'll watch the baby.

03:54.559 --> 03:55.560
[Wiley] Yeah?

03:55.643 --> 03:57.520
- Really, you sure you don't mind?
- [Tracey] Yeah.

03:57.603 --> 03:58.604
Yeah, no, that's fine.

03:58.689 --> 03:59.773
[Wiley] Okay.
[Ronnie] Awesome.

04:00.691 --> 04:01.817
[Wiley] Thank you.

04:05.028 --> 04:06.112
- Let's go.
- Okay.

04:10.701 --> 04:14.120
- Why'd you take the kid?
- Maybe you should go stop them.

04:14.204 --> 04:16.915
Tracey, come on, he's our brother.

04:16.998 --> 04:18.416
She'll be fine.

04:19.709 --> 04:21.795
You've played the blood card before.

04:28.134 --> 04:31.512
Welcome, sir.
In the mood for a new set of wheels?

04:31.596 --> 04:32.931
Are you sure about this?

04:33.014 --> 04:36.059
I heard Chuck's dad almost killed Ronnie
for stealing one of his cars.

04:36.142 --> 04:39.771
Yeah, and his dad's dead.
You think Chuck's gonna care?

04:39.855 --> 04:42.607
Besides, Ronnie told me
they only got caught because of a tracker

04:42.691 --> 04:45.026
and no one can track us
with communications down.

04:45.944 --> 04:48.238
It's about time
we started to enjoy ourselves.

04:50.156 --> 04:51.950
- Get in the car.
- [car beeps]

04:55.411 --> 04:57.413
[tires screeching]

05:03.044 --> 05:04.755
[Felix] That idiot's gonna kill someone.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.506
That's one of the cars
from the Lotts' dealership.

05:12.428 --> 05:13.889
Sweet car.

05:13.972 --> 05:15.390
How fast do you think it goes?

05:16.516 --> 05:18.059
Excellent question.

05:18.143 --> 05:20.186
There's really only one way to find out.
[chuckles]

05:30.864 --> 05:32.573
[panting]

05:38.329 --> 05:39.497
[overlapping voices]

05:39.580 --> 05:41.291
You wouldn't know the difference
between right and wrong

05:41.374 --> 05:42.417
if it sat on your rich face.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.252
I'm not gonna stand here
and watch this town fall apart.

05:44.335 --> 05:45.461
Are you mad at me?

05:45.545 --> 05:47.964
Never forget, you're a Lotts.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.758
You never worked for a damn thing.

05:49.841 --> 05:51.051
I'm trying to keep everybody safe.

05:51.134 --> 05:52.427
I expect great things from you.

05:52.510 --> 05:53.719
- This is stupid.
- We will get through this.

05:53.804 --> 05:55.596
It's not over, Gord.
They lied to us!

05:55.680 --> 05:57.849
You're a Lotts.
Make us proud, son.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.561
[panting]

06:05.065 --> 06:06.524
Hey.

06:08.109 --> 06:09.235
Are you okay?

06:09.319 --> 06:10.570
Oh, uh...

06:10.653 --> 06:11.988
yeah.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.908
- What happened?
- There was just a stray dog.

06:14.991 --> 06:17.452
I think it was more scared of me
than I was of it.

06:17.535 --> 06:20.956
I tried to take it in and stuff,
but it had other ideas.

06:21.039 --> 06:23.208
- Big dog?
- Uh, actually, it...

06:23.291 --> 06:25.168
it was a Chihuahua.

06:25.251 --> 06:26.627
[chuckles]

06:27.795 --> 06:29.255
What, do you think that's funny?

06:29.339 --> 06:31.674
Well, there's no part of that
that's not funny.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.676
[laughing]

06:33.759 --> 06:35.761
Yeah, I know.

06:37.513 --> 06:39.474
Where have I met you before?

06:40.100 --> 06:45.313
Chuck, we had Chemistry, English,
and Algebra together last semester.

06:45.396 --> 06:47.315
It's Samantha.

06:47.398 --> 06:51.611
Right, I'm sorry.
You just... you look a little different.

06:52.528 --> 06:54.655
Look... How?

06:54.739 --> 06:56.532
Well, I mean, it's...

06:58.326 --> 07:00.661
Yeah, I don't remember you.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

07:00.745 --> 07:02.247
It's okay.

07:02.330 --> 07:05.208
Different social circles, I guess.

07:05.291 --> 07:07.293
Wasn't there that rule in the old world

07:07.377 --> 07:11.506
that the jocks could only talk
to the cheerleaders?

07:12.423 --> 07:15.593
Right.
Yeah, I forgot about that.

07:16.887 --> 07:18.804
And what about in the new world?

07:20.765 --> 07:24.560
I guess we seem to be making the rules up
one day at a time.

07:27.730 --> 07:29.107
All right, later, Chuck.

07:45.331 --> 07:47.000
What do you think you're doing?

07:47.918 --> 07:50.461
- Excuse me?
- My father owns this bar.

07:50.545 --> 07:52.255
So technically, I own it now.

07:52.338 --> 07:55.716
So what the hell makes you think
you can just come in here and open it?

07:56.842 --> 07:59.720
I'm sorry, guys told me
whoever owned it died.

08:00.430 --> 08:02.723
Who exactly told you that?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.102
Listen, my mistake.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.813
I'll just take my beer,
I'll put it back in the truck

08:08.897 --> 08:10.315
and I'll be out of your way.

08:15.736 --> 08:16.905
Wait!

08:18.114 --> 08:19.324
[sighs]

08:20.325 --> 08:22.202
Maybe we can work something out.

08:33.337 --> 08:35.173
- [engine revving]
- [laughs]

08:37.467 --> 08:38.801
[tires screeching]

08:40.720 --> 08:42.804
That was a close one!

08:42.888 --> 08:44.349
They've all been close ones!

08:44.432 --> 08:46.309
This is the coolest thing we've ever done.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.770
- Brake, brake!
- [brakes screech]

08:53.149 --> 08:55.986
- [toys clattering]
- [Melissa sighs]

08:56.069 --> 08:57.195
Can you...

08:57.278 --> 08:58.947
please just stop?

08:59.030 --> 09:01.407
And pick those up!
Thank you.

09:01.491 --> 09:02.783
Hi, guys.

09:02.867 --> 09:05.954
Can you maybe just go take a time out
over there for five minutes?

09:06.037 --> 09:08.248
Hey, sweetie, hi.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.501
Where's the baby?

09:11.584 --> 09:12.877
I'm not sure.

09:12.961 --> 09:15.255
Um, can you go line up?
Yeah?

09:15.338 --> 09:17.548
Okay, thank you, honey.

09:17.632 --> 09:19.550
Oh, God.

09:19.634 --> 09:20.676
Hi.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.137
Where's all your help?

09:22.220 --> 09:23.721
They just keep disappearing.

09:23.804 --> 09:26.182
- Even Wiley?
- Uh...

09:27.183 --> 09:29.935
her and I got into a fight last night...

09:30.020 --> 09:31.896
and she took off with the baby,

09:31.980 --> 09:34.357
and I kind of thought
she'd be back by now.

09:35.483 --> 09:37.986
Listen, why don't you
get out of here for a bit?

09:38.069 --> 09:40.946
See if you can find her.
Looks like you can use a break

09:41.031 --> 09:42.907
and I'm pretty sure
I can handle this myself.

09:42.991 --> 09:44.450
Thank you.

09:44.534 --> 09:46.244
Thank you.

09:51.749 --> 09:52.917
Hi.

09:54.002 --> 09:57.255
I pooped my pants.
I did.

09:57.338 --> 09:58.339
[groans]

09:59.340 --> 10:00.341
Ugh.

10:01.759 --> 10:02.843
Idiots.

10:02.927 --> 10:05.055
[Felix sighs]
Come on.

10:07.098 --> 10:09.600
[Vince] Hey!
[Felix] Stop!

10:09.684 --> 10:11.311
No point in running!

10:11.394 --> 10:14.772
[Vince] Get back here!
You guys are dead!

10:50.933 --> 10:52.102
[sniffs]

11:00.985 --> 11:02.195
[sighs]

11:17.460 --> 11:18.961
Pat.

11:25.176 --> 11:26.719
Ronnie has an alibi.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.639
[Adam] I'm not talking
about Ronnie.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.224
Look familiar?

11:34.435 --> 11:35.436
Not really.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.605
This is Pat's baseball hat.

11:38.564 --> 11:40.566
Suppose it is. And?

11:40.650 --> 11:42.610
This puts Pat at the crime scene.

11:43.528 --> 11:47.532
So, based on a mass-produced baseball hat,
you're saying that...

11:47.615 --> 11:49.033
Pat killed Lana?

11:49.117 --> 11:52.995
Gord, think about it this way.
Can I prove this is Pat's hat?

11:53.078 --> 11:54.205
No.

11:55.165 --> 11:56.999
But does it reasonably
put him under suspicion?

11:57.082 --> 11:58.083
[Gord] No.

11:58.168 --> 12:01.086
For all you know, Lana liked the hat
and Ronnie stole it for her.

12:01.171 --> 12:02.880
Ever hear of Occam's razor?

12:04.048 --> 12:06.717
The simplest answer
is most likely the right one.

12:06.801 --> 12:09.304
No, and that certainly
doesn't prove anything.

12:09.387 --> 12:11.764
- But it's at least enough to...
- To what?

12:12.765 --> 12:15.142
We don't have a court of law, Adam.

12:15.226 --> 12:17.437
We don't even have electricity, now...

12:17.520 --> 12:19.522
Damn it, you're the smartest
guy around here,

12:19.605 --> 12:21.857
but you're working for a dead girl.

12:22.858 --> 12:26.196
How about you start working
for the people left living?

12:28.489 --> 12:33.328
Gord, if she was murdered,
then the murderer is still at large,

12:33.411 --> 12:35.871
and we're trapped in here with him.

12:37.248 --> 12:39.292
I think that's reason enough.

12:42.909 --> 12:45.662
[Felix sighs] What the hell
were you guys thinking?

12:45.745 --> 12:47.121
You're lucky you're still alive.

12:47.204 --> 12:49.248
For a second there,
I thought we were going to die.

12:49.331 --> 12:50.958
That was awesome!

12:51.042 --> 12:55.462
I don't know how awesome you're gonna
think it is when Chuck hears about this.

12:55.546 --> 12:57.506
Whatever. You guys think
you're, like, the police or something?

12:57.589 --> 12:59.008
Keep talking, tough guy.

13:03.721 --> 13:05.181
Wiley?

13:07.099 --> 13:08.309
Wiley?

13:12.396 --> 13:13.397
[sighs]

13:23.741 --> 13:25.034
[sighs]

13:28.287 --> 13:32.750
No, I'm supplying all the beer.
We split the profits 75-25.

13:33.835 --> 13:36.253
My bar, my taps.
50-50.

13:36.337 --> 13:39.966
Well, I think my beer
is doing all the heavy lifting.

13:40.049 --> 13:42.426
50-50 or no deal.

13:45.763 --> 13:48.349
Sure... for now.

13:49.433 --> 13:50.684
For now?

13:50.768 --> 13:56.440
Seems to me we'd have fun renegotiating
if, you know, this all works out.

13:58.735 --> 14:00.319
Well, I can drink to that.

14:10.037 --> 14:11.205
Where are the kids?

14:12.539 --> 14:14.625
They're in the church with Ms. Symonds.

14:15.251 --> 14:16.919
Uh, you haven't seen Wiley, have you?

14:17.003 --> 14:19.964
No, everything all right?

14:20.047 --> 14:21.799
Yeah, I think so, but...

14:21.883 --> 14:24.385
nobody's seen her since yesterday,
and I was worried.

14:24.468 --> 14:26.763
- Maybe she's with Adam?
- No, no.

14:26.846 --> 14:30.057
I was with him earlier today.
He didn't mention anything.

14:30.892 --> 14:32.018
Where's the baby?

14:32.101 --> 14:35.271
That's the thing,
is that she took him with her.

14:35.354 --> 14:37.148
Any idea where she might've gone?

14:37.231 --> 14:40.902
- No, not really. Maybe my uncle's place.
- Okay.

14:40.985 --> 14:42.528
Franny and I will head out there.

14:42.611 --> 14:44.947
- We'll take a look.
- You'd do that?

14:47.699 --> 14:48.826
Of course.

14:50.744 --> 14:51.954
Thank you.

14:53.039 --> 14:54.373
That means a lot.

15:00.129 --> 15:01.547
[Wiley] Nah, it's insane.

15:01.630 --> 15:03.424
Well, think about it.
It's the only thing that makes sense.

15:03.507 --> 15:05.592
No, you're not gonna convince me

15:05.676 --> 15:09.055
it's even possible that all this
was the work of terrorists, Ronnie.

15:09.138 --> 15:10.514
Okay.

15:10.597 --> 15:13.559
But if I do, will you drink a beer?

15:17.104 --> 15:18.480
Fine.

15:18.564 --> 15:19.606
You're gonna lose.

15:19.690 --> 15:21.400
- [laughs]
- So...

15:21.483 --> 15:23.194
[Ronnie] Okay.

15:23.277 --> 15:27.531
So this virus is released,
or whatever it is.

15:27.614 --> 15:29.158
And who does it kill?

15:29.241 --> 15:32.536
Hmm? Every adult.
Everyone who's fighting age.

15:32.619 --> 15:34.956
It's a perfect way
to take out a nation's army.

15:35.039 --> 15:36.123
We're fighting age.

15:36.207 --> 15:38.584
Okay, so it doesn't take out everyone
in the army, but...

15:38.667 --> 15:40.502
just the ones
with the most experience?

15:40.586 --> 15:42.296
So then no one would know what to do?

15:43.172 --> 15:46.467
Okay, let's say that's true.

15:46.550 --> 15:48.510
Why was it only released in Pretty Lake?

15:48.594 --> 15:50.637
So that the government
could prove that they could do it.

15:50.721 --> 15:52.890
It's stage one of their plan.

15:54.766 --> 15:56.018
Uh...

15:57.103 --> 15:59.521
your argument is not airtight.

15:59.605 --> 16:01.899
Ah, but it is possible?

16:03.109 --> 16:05.777
- Yes? [laughs]
- Yeah, I guess.

16:05.862 --> 16:07.613
All right, drink.

16:07.696 --> 16:09.991
- Yeah, okay. Sure.
- You said you would.

16:10.074 --> 16:11.783
- [chuckles]
- [beer can opens]

16:12.994 --> 16:14.078
[muffled laugh]

16:15.329 --> 16:16.330
[chuckles]

16:16.914 --> 16:18.124
[Ms. Symonds] Marco!

16:18.207 --> 16:19.834
[kids] Polo!

16:19.917 --> 16:21.085
Marco!

16:21.168 --> 16:22.503
[kids] Polo!

16:22.586 --> 16:24.380
- Marco!
- Polo!

16:24.463 --> 16:26.632
- [Melissa] What are you doing?
- Melissa!

16:26.715 --> 16:29.010
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

16:29.093 --> 16:31.303
How dare you bring the kids
up here to play. This is a church.

16:31.387 --> 16:33.347
I'm so sorry.
I wasn't raised religious.

16:33.430 --> 16:36.142
- I didn't think it'd be that big a deal.
- Well, it is a big deal.

16:36.225 --> 16:37.852
This is a sacred place and
now it's trashed.

16:37.935 --> 16:39.603
That's why I never brought them over here.

16:39.686 --> 16:41.480
- Okay, we can clean it up quickly.
- Sure.

16:42.106 --> 16:44.901
Maybe you could fix
all the wrecked Bibles at the same time?

16:46.402 --> 16:48.445
I was just trying to keep the kids
entertained, okay?

16:48.529 --> 16:50.697
They're going crazy
being in that room all day.

16:50.781 --> 16:51.866
Thank you for the lesson,

16:51.949 --> 16:54.576
but I've been doing just fine
without your advice so far.

16:57.038 --> 16:58.998
Then they're all yours.

17:02.709 --> 17:03.710
[sighs]

17:05.087 --> 17:08.299
[Chuck] So explain this to me again.
[Amanda] Yeah, explain this.

17:08.382 --> 17:09.884
Easy, Amanda. I got this.

17:09.967 --> 17:12.428
You got this.
I should keep my mouth shut.

17:12.511 --> 17:15.932
- I should keep my mouth shut.
- [laughs]

17:16.015 --> 17:17.598
You think this is funny?

17:18.684 --> 17:21.311
We thought that we'd just take it,
then return it.

17:21.395 --> 17:23.646
Honestly, we didn't intend
to crash it. We figured...

17:23.730 --> 17:25.273
Stop.

17:25.357 --> 17:26.775
You're not a cop.

17:26.858 --> 17:28.860
Stop acting like one.
Let us go.

17:28.945 --> 17:30.154
[sighs]

17:31.280 --> 17:33.157
- Excuse me?
- They're not your cars.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.951
They were your father's.

17:35.034 --> 17:37.286
Stop pretending that somehow
you're the law around here.

17:37.369 --> 17:41.040
Listen, kid. Right now,
for lack of a better choice, I am.

17:41.123 --> 17:43.167
You're just a kid like the rest of us.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.044
Just because everyone
was afraid of your dad

17:45.127 --> 17:46.587
doesn't mean we're gonna be afraid of you.

17:46.670 --> 17:47.879
[sighs]

17:49.340 --> 17:52.134
Lucky for you, Harrison...

17:52.218 --> 17:54.011
I'm not my dad.

17:55.012 --> 17:57.223
I'm gonna give you two choices.
And you, as well.

17:58.224 --> 18:02.061
You apologize and agree to do 30 hours
of community service

18:02.144 --> 18:03.854
and we forget about this whole thing.

18:03.938 --> 18:05.897
What's the second choice?

18:05.982 --> 18:07.524
[laughs softly]

18:14.906 --> 18:17.118
You still feeling tough?

18:17.201 --> 18:19.120
Still pretending to be a cop?

18:23.582 --> 18:24.791
Listen up.

18:25.751 --> 18:28.462
This is what happens
when you steal.

18:28.545 --> 18:30.922
He'll be tied up here
until he apologizes.

18:31.007 --> 18:33.300
Then after that,
30 hours of community service.

18:33.384 --> 18:36.553
Anybody that tries to free him
will join him, you understand?

18:38.347 --> 18:39.974
Okay, tell your friends.

18:41.725 --> 18:43.852
You stay here.
Make sure no one unties him.

18:43.935 --> 18:45.396
When he breaks,
you come get me.

18:48.190 --> 18:49.858
[sighs deeply]

18:52.403 --> 18:53.945
Just say you're sorry, Harrison.

18:54.030 --> 18:57.324
Screw you!
I won't give him the pleasure.

19:13.215 --> 19:14.591
[door opening]

19:14.675 --> 19:16.677
Can I help you with something?

19:16.760 --> 19:18.012
Um...

19:19.846 --> 19:22.349
I was looking for some drugs.

19:28.355 --> 19:30.357
What's going on?

19:30.441 --> 19:33.485
This guy wants some drugs.

19:33.569 --> 19:36.197
Not any kind of drugs, just drugs.

19:36.863 --> 19:38.449
So, why'd you come to us?

19:39.908 --> 19:41.827
Ronnie... you know.

19:42.869 --> 19:44.205
No, what?

19:45.206 --> 19:47.541
I'm sorry.
I should leave.

19:47.624 --> 19:48.625
Not so fast.

19:51.212 --> 19:53.214
Why don't you tell us
why you're really here?

19:53.297 --> 19:55.049
Why so nervous?

19:57.134 --> 19:59.553
Nothing, um...

19:59.636 --> 20:01.680
this was a stupid idea.

20:01.763 --> 20:03.140
You came for Wiley, didn't you?

20:05.976 --> 20:07.603
Wiley's here?

20:07.686 --> 20:09.688
[scoffs] Come on, don't play dumb.

20:11.148 --> 20:14.068
Just so you know,
she came by herself.

20:14.151 --> 20:15.819
Nobody forced her.

20:17.113 --> 20:18.572
Can I see her?

20:20.031 --> 20:21.658
[Tracey] She's out with Ronnie.

20:21.742 --> 20:24.286
I don't think
she'll be back for a while.

20:25.537 --> 20:26.997
Okay, um...

20:28.039 --> 20:29.291
Can you tell her I came by?

20:30.041 --> 20:31.877
Sure.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.420
Anything else?

20:34.338 --> 20:35.464
No.

20:42.388 --> 20:44.348
Poor kid.

20:44.431 --> 20:46.016
What are you talking about?

20:47.226 --> 20:48.685
Can't you see
how disappointed he was

20:48.769 --> 20:50.562
to learn that his girlfriend
was with Ronnie?

20:50.646 --> 20:52.523
You could practically see his heart break.

20:52.606 --> 20:53.607
[Pat scoffs]

20:54.858 --> 20:58.362
At first, I could have sworn
he was gonna steal your boots.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.406
What?

21:00.489 --> 21:02.574
Yeah, I saw him from the window.

21:02.658 --> 21:05.536
He was picking up your boots,
looking them over.

21:23.053 --> 21:25.472
I always kind of hated this place.

21:25.556 --> 21:26.765
What?

21:28.642 --> 21:30.269
I always thought
my parents bought a bar

21:30.352 --> 21:31.978
so that they could have
a free place to drink.

21:33.480 --> 21:36.483
I think they spent more time here
than they did at home.

21:37.901 --> 21:39.611
Were they bad drunks?

21:40.821 --> 21:43.782
My mom could handle her liquor, but, uh...

21:45.992 --> 21:47.411
Dad not so much.

21:48.537 --> 21:49.621
Violent?

21:51.748 --> 21:53.959
Yeah, sometimes.

21:56.170 --> 21:57.213
Mine, too.

21:57.296 --> 21:58.672
[door opens]

22:01.508 --> 22:04.135
- Is the bar back in business?
- [Stacey sighs] Not for kids.

22:04.220 --> 22:06.847
[boy] Seriously?
[Mark] How old are you?

22:06.930 --> 22:08.390
Sixteen.

22:09.516 --> 22:10.517
Hell, when I was 16,

22:10.601 --> 22:14.188
I was either drunk or high half the time.
How about you?

22:15.522 --> 22:17.983
Yeah, I partied sometimes.

22:18.066 --> 22:21.945
So then who are we to tell these kids
that they can't have a drink?

22:22.028 --> 22:24.948
Wouldn't that be totally hypocritical?
And besides, money's money.

22:27.284 --> 22:28.452
Yeah, okay.

22:28.535 --> 22:31.747
But if anybody pukes on the floor,
it's a $200 fine.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.632
[Franny] Wiley's not here.

22:42.716 --> 22:44.050
[Gord] Nope.

22:48.597 --> 22:50.474
So what do you think about Melissa?

22:50.557 --> 22:51.725
Melissa who?

22:52.684 --> 22:54.144
Answer the question.

22:54.228 --> 22:56.272
She likes you.

22:56.355 --> 22:58.064
How could you possibly know that?

22:59.275 --> 23:00.859
She say something?

23:00.942 --> 23:04.195
Of course not,
but it's kind of obvious.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.240
- Seriously?
- Yeah!

23:06.323 --> 23:07.949
Do you like her?

23:09.117 --> 23:10.411
Maybe.

23:19.044 --> 23:20.045
Adam.

23:20.128 --> 23:22.589
- Hey.
- Ms. Symonds.

23:22.673 --> 23:24.800
You're gonna have to call me Amy now.

23:24.883 --> 23:26.009
Okay, Amy.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.762
- Feels weird.
- [chuckles]

23:28.845 --> 23:30.472
You'll get used to it.

23:30.556 --> 23:32.974
Mmm, have a beer.

23:33.892 --> 23:36.562
Can you believe
they're charging $50 a pitcher?

23:36.645 --> 23:38.188
They're actually taking money?

23:38.271 --> 23:40.273
- [scoffs]
- What's the point?

23:40.357 --> 23:44.986
That there's hope.
That they can actually save for a future.

23:46.154 --> 23:48.156
Cheers to a new economy.

23:54.037 --> 23:55.080
What's wrong?

23:56.915 --> 23:58.083
Nothing.

23:58.166 --> 24:00.461
You can tell me.

24:00.544 --> 24:02.588
Okay, but you have to promise...

24:02.671 --> 24:04.423
not a word to anyone.

24:06.007 --> 24:07.468
Okay.

24:08.218 --> 24:09.720
[Ronnie and Wiley laughing]

24:11.722 --> 24:14.015
[chuckling] Come on, have another.

24:14.099 --> 24:17.519
No, I can't.
I've reached my limit.

24:17.603 --> 24:20.063
Well, come on, you couldn't drink
when you were preggo, right?

24:20.146 --> 24:21.272
It's time to catch up.

24:23.233 --> 24:24.443
Wait, shh.

24:25.611 --> 24:27.237
I think I hear something.

24:28.321 --> 24:30.741
[Ronnie] Is it Bigfoot?
The Sasquatch?

24:30.824 --> 24:33.535
[laughs] A Yeti?
There's nothing out there, Wiley.

24:33.619 --> 24:36.455
- [Wiley sighs]
- Except for the stupid fence.

24:36.538 --> 24:37.914
Hey, I have excellent hearing.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.791
Oh, yeah?
How's your eyesight?

24:40.876 --> 24:42.002
Hey!

24:42.961 --> 24:44.463
What, am I not good enough?

24:44.546 --> 24:45.797
Excuse me?

24:45.881 --> 24:47.340
You think you're better than me?

24:47.424 --> 24:49.300
No. It's...

24:49.385 --> 24:52.388
- No, it's not that at all.
- Well, what is it then?

24:52.471 --> 24:54.931
Look, I'm sorry if I...
if I gave the wrong impression.

24:55.015 --> 24:57.476
And I appreciate everything
that you've done for me, but I just...

24:57.559 --> 25:01.271
- Just not good enough for you, right?
- No, Ronnie.

25:01.354 --> 25:02.481
I...

25:03.064 --> 25:06.527
I don't know how to explain it, okay?

25:09.154 --> 25:11.407
Can we just hunt?

25:11.490 --> 25:14.034
Yeah, let's hunt.

25:22.042 --> 25:24.210
We're making a killing.

25:24.294 --> 25:28.298
When they lift the quarantine,
we'll be loaded.

25:28.381 --> 25:29.925
How much beer do we have left?

25:30.008 --> 25:32.469
[scoffs] Plenty.
That truck was full.

25:32.553 --> 25:35.138
- I'd say we make a pretty good team.
- Yeah.

25:35.221 --> 25:36.515
[Stacey] Mmm-hmm.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.852
So, I have a question for you then.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.608
How's that feel?

25:46.692 --> 25:48.151
It's been a long time.

25:49.194 --> 25:52.322
Well, then I'd say we're due for a break,
wouldn't you?

25:52.405 --> 25:53.865
- Yeah.
- [laughs softly]

25:56.367 --> 25:57.536
You're the boss.

25:58.495 --> 26:00.789
I hope you're better
than my last boyfriend.

26:02.082 --> 26:05.961
That's why in the real world they have
lawyers and courts and everything.

26:06.044 --> 26:08.714
If you tell Chuck, Pat is dead.

26:08.797 --> 26:10.966
It's as simple as that.

26:11.049 --> 26:15.721
But what choice do I have?
He's killed once, he'll kill again.

26:16.513 --> 26:18.306
At least sleep on it.

26:19.182 --> 26:20.726
And until then?

26:20.809 --> 26:22.227
We drink.

26:24.395 --> 26:26.189
It's my birthday.

26:27.148 --> 26:28.775
[glasses clink]

26:30.694 --> 26:33.071
You're 22.

26:36.533 --> 26:37.576
Damn.

26:39.119 --> 26:40.996
Yeah.

26:43.582 --> 26:45.000
Damn.

26:48.921 --> 26:52.800
- See? He's cold. He's shaking.
- I said come get me if anything was wrong.

26:52.883 --> 26:55.052
Look at him!
Something's wrong.

26:55.135 --> 26:57.972
- [breathing raggedly]
- [Chuck] Harrison.

26:58.055 --> 27:00.099
Hey, this could all be over, pal.

27:00.891 --> 27:02.434
I just needed to teach you a lesson

27:02.518 --> 27:05.437
so that everybody around here
wouldn't do the same stupid stuff you did.

27:06.396 --> 27:07.523
Just apologize.

27:14.947 --> 27:17.742
[groans] Big mistake.

27:22.788 --> 27:26.876
We should head back into town.
I bet Wiley's already come back.

27:26.959 --> 27:30.796
Yeah, we've run out of
logical places to look.

27:40.305 --> 27:42.016
Wait right here.

27:42.099 --> 27:44.602
Sure, whatever you say.

27:45.936 --> 27:47.271
[Gord] Hey!

27:49.815 --> 27:51.358
Hey, you okay?

27:52.943 --> 27:54.529
Where's my horse?

27:56.113 --> 27:57.948
What horse?

27:59.033 --> 28:00.826
Last thing I remember, my...

28:00.910 --> 28:03.746
my horse got spooked
and threw me off.

28:04.539 --> 28:05.581
Hanna?

28:05.665 --> 28:07.416
You know her?

28:07.499 --> 28:09.960
Yeah, she went to our middle school.

28:10.044 --> 28:11.754
I never saw you after that.

28:11.837 --> 28:13.505
Figured you moved away.

28:14.214 --> 28:15.966
Yeah, I remember you.

28:19.679 --> 28:21.346
You know, for somebody
that was out of practice,

28:21.430 --> 28:23.140
that was pretty good.

28:23.223 --> 28:24.725
Well, you seem to have
more than enough experience

28:24.809 --> 28:26.476
to make up for the both of us.

28:27.477 --> 28:28.729
What?

28:30.147 --> 28:32.650
[sighs] Nothing.
We got work to do.

28:34.109 --> 28:35.485
[Chuck] Are you Mark?

28:36.070 --> 28:37.154
[Mark] Yeah.

28:37.237 --> 28:38.573
You are?

28:38.656 --> 28:40.616
From around here.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.952
I mean you?
Not so much.

28:44.411 --> 28:45.955
That a problem?

28:46.038 --> 28:47.331
The problem is you selling to kids.

28:47.414 --> 28:49.834
There are 12-year-olds
that are drunk off their asses here.

28:51.961 --> 28:54.046
I didn't want to.

28:54.129 --> 28:56.048
Stacey said to do it.
She makes the rules.

28:56.131 --> 28:57.842
It's her bar, her way.

28:59.635 --> 29:03.305
- [sighs] That didn't take you long.
- [sighs]

29:03.388 --> 29:04.765
I think you should get out of here.

29:04.849 --> 29:07.017
And I think you should go to hell.

29:07.101 --> 29:09.687
This is one of the only places
that your daddy doesn't own.

29:09.770 --> 29:12.314
Come on, Stacey.
Selling to kids?

29:12.397 --> 29:13.440
Nice.

29:13.523 --> 29:14.817
Listen closely.

29:14.900 --> 29:17.027
When the quarantine gets lifted,
you can have your bar back.

29:17.111 --> 29:18.946
But until then you've lost that right.
Do you understand?

29:21.699 --> 29:23.075
Is this about Ronnie?

29:24.660 --> 29:27.537
No, this is, um...
this is about you.

29:29.707 --> 29:31.250
Can you help me out here?

29:31.333 --> 29:34.795
I think I was pretty clear.
We shouldn't have been selling to kids.

29:34.879 --> 29:36.922
That... that's what I said!

29:37.840 --> 29:40.009
Lying won't help you.

29:40.092 --> 29:41.426
And you're gonna believe
this guy over me?

29:41.510 --> 29:43.679
Well, at this point,
I'd believe anybody but you.

29:52.730 --> 29:55.024
Don't make the same mistake twice.

29:57.192 --> 29:59.194
[sighs]

29:59.278 --> 30:01.989
Okay, anyone under 18 isn't drinking.

30:02.072 --> 30:04.449
- So you're not drinking.
- [kid] Aw, come on, man!

30:04.533 --> 30:06.035
How's your leg?

30:06.118 --> 30:08.495
You following in your dad's footsteps?

30:08.578 --> 30:09.664
What do you mean?

30:09.747 --> 30:14.334
Well, he all but ran Pretty Lake, right?
Now you're taking over.

30:15.335 --> 30:18.380
You know, when the quarantine is over,
at least I'll know that I've done my part.

30:18.463 --> 30:21.634
I'm... I'm just trying to make sure
no one gets hurt.

30:21.717 --> 30:25.095
Well, does the noble sheriff
have time for a drink?

30:25.179 --> 30:28.140
Or is he...
is he too busy saving the day?

30:29.767 --> 30:31.268
Well, that depends.
Are you buying?

30:31.351 --> 30:34.354
[scoffs and laughs]
Yeah, right.

30:41.611 --> 30:45.032
Hey, um, how much longer
are we planning on staying out here?

30:46.742 --> 30:48.285
Yeah, well...

30:49.995 --> 30:52.581
that's the thing about hunting is, uh...

30:59.421 --> 31:01.799
the animals seem to run
on their own timeline.

31:01.882 --> 31:03.175
[sniffs]

31:03.258 --> 31:04.551
[Wiley] Okay.

31:05.510 --> 31:07.596
Well, I'm freezing.
I cannot feel my toes.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.765
And I really should be with my baby.

31:10.557 --> 31:12.184
Maybe I could warm you up.

31:12.267 --> 31:15.312
Nah, that's all right.
I'm not gonna die of frostbite.

31:15.395 --> 31:18.565
- Come on, Wiley, stop pretending.
- Ronnie, God, seriously!

31:18.648 --> 31:21.068
I made myself pretty clear, okay?
I'm not interested.

31:21.151 --> 31:24.071
- Well, maybe I can make you interested.
- God, Ronnie!

31:24.154 --> 31:25.823
Quit! Stop it!

31:25.906 --> 31:27.825
Ronnie, stop!

31:27.908 --> 31:29.910
- Ronnie, stop it!
- You're not better than me!

31:29.994 --> 31:31.704
- Stop.
- [Wiley gasps]

31:31.787 --> 31:33.873
[breathing heavily]
Just lay down.

31:33.956 --> 31:35.624
- [trembling] No! No!
- Okay?

31:35.708 --> 31:37.334
- I know you want to.
- No!

31:37.417 --> 31:39.003
- I know you do.
- Stop it!

31:39.920 --> 31:41.421
Do it.

31:45.843 --> 31:47.052
Okay.

31:49.429 --> 31:51.098
Good.

32:02.234 --> 32:03.443
- [Wiley yells]
- [groans]

32:09.324 --> 32:10.993
Ronnie?

32:15.873 --> 32:17.416
[Ms. Symonds] Yes!

32:17.499 --> 32:20.544
See that? Strike. Again.

32:21.170 --> 32:23.505
[Adam] Did you have a bowling alley
in your basement growing up?

32:23.588 --> 32:25.174
[Ms. Symonds] A couple, actually.

32:25.257 --> 32:26.759
Now let's set up the pins
so we can watch you

32:26.842 --> 32:29.136
fail spectacularly again, Mr. Gutterball.

32:29.219 --> 32:32.139
[Adam] I'm just purposely not trying
because it's your birthday.

32:32.222 --> 32:34.433
Aw, thanks, Adam.

32:34.516 --> 32:36.060
You know, all things considered,

32:36.143 --> 32:38.603
this has actually been
a really good birthday.

32:38.687 --> 32:39.772
[laughs softly]

32:39.855 --> 32:41.857
[Pat] Adam.

32:43.984 --> 32:45.694
I've been looking for you.

33:25.650 --> 33:27.069
Ronnie?

33:27.152 --> 33:28.821
- [grunts]
- [screaming]

33:32.574 --> 33:35.077
Get off!
Get off of me!

33:36.786 --> 33:39.081
I don't... don't feel...

33:39.164 --> 33:41.625
don't feel so good.

33:42.835 --> 33:45.254
Wake up!
Harrison, wake up!

33:53.303 --> 33:54.554
Stay there.

33:54.638 --> 33:56.765
[Pat] Now look, I just want to talk.

33:56.849 --> 33:59.101
I won't tell anyone
you killed Lana, okay?

33:59.184 --> 34:00.769
I'm sure you had your reasons.

34:00.853 --> 34:03.772
[Pat] Listen, I just need you
to hear my side of the story.

34:04.689 --> 34:06.733
Is that why you brought a gun?

34:06.816 --> 34:11.446
Not exactly in friendly territory, Adam.
I'm just trying to protect myself.

34:12.072 --> 34:13.949
So what's your alibi?

34:14.033 --> 34:16.493
I found out Ronnie was going to see her.

34:16.576 --> 34:19.079
That's why I left early.
To try and talk to her, to stop her.

34:19.996 --> 34:22.706
Thing is, I found out
she's Ronnie's supplier.

34:24.083 --> 34:25.835
And she was into hard stuff.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.213
But that's the Lotts.
I mean, they think they're above the law.

34:28.297 --> 34:31.300
But sooner or later,
Ronnie would've got arrested.

34:31.382 --> 34:33.802
So I went down there
to put a stop to it.

34:35.262 --> 34:36.804
When I got there, I realized...

34:38.014 --> 34:39.349
she was trying to kill herself.

34:41.226 --> 34:42.811
She had a gun.

34:42.895 --> 34:45.397
I tried to stop her.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.773
[stutters] I couldn't.

34:46.856 --> 34:48.400
I believe you.

34:50.819 --> 34:52.404
But you don't, do you?

34:52.487 --> 34:56.241
Come on...
what do you want me to say?

34:56.324 --> 34:59.286
What's it matter
if I believe you or not?

34:59.369 --> 35:00.412
There's no proof.

35:00.495 --> 35:02.456
If you wanna kill me,
you're gonna kill me.

35:03.207 --> 35:04.333
What?

35:05.334 --> 35:06.335
[sighs]

35:07.294 --> 35:08.670
Just read this.

35:08.753 --> 35:10.255
Here's your proof.

35:12.882 --> 35:14.218
[Chuck] Pat!

35:14.301 --> 35:15.844
- [cocks gun]
- [Pat] Chuck, listen.

35:15.928 --> 35:17.930
- [gun fires]
- [cocks gun]

35:26.480 --> 35:29.858
[Chuck] Vince, Felix, go after him.
I'm gonna go around back.

35:31.401 --> 35:33.403
- [Adam] Chuck! Chuck!
- What?

35:33.487 --> 35:34.779
Stop, stop.

35:34.863 --> 35:36.365
I don't think he did it.

35:36.448 --> 35:38.908
No, Felix told me that you said that...

35:38.993 --> 35:39.994
Here.

35:41.411 --> 35:44.498
She left a suicide note.
I'm sorry, Chuck.

35:44.581 --> 35:46.959
No, no, no.
You said that there was a struggle.

35:47.042 --> 35:49.128
- The boot prints!
- There was a struggle.

35:49.211 --> 35:51.380
Pat tried to stop her.
I believe him.

35:52.631 --> 35:53.548
Chuck!

35:54.591 --> 35:56.010
Not now! Not now!

35:56.093 --> 35:58.220
Harrison's passed out.
He won't wake up.

36:04.643 --> 36:05.685
You could've killed me.

36:05.769 --> 36:07.229
[screaming] Stop, you bastard!

36:07.312 --> 36:08.647
- Shut up!
- No!

36:08.730 --> 36:11.775
Stop it! Everybody knows you're not
right in the head, Ronnie.

36:11.858 --> 36:15.695
The only way you could get a girl
is to rape her!

36:15.779 --> 36:17.114
One more word.

36:17.739 --> 36:18.907
One more word!

36:18.991 --> 36:20.159
- You dick!
- [grunting]

36:21.326 --> 36:22.911
- [screaming]
- [breathing heavily]

36:24.288 --> 36:26.081
Shh, it's okay.

36:26.956 --> 36:28.208
It's okay.

36:28.292 --> 36:29.418
Don't!

36:29.501 --> 36:32.129
[gasping] Don't touch me.

36:41.513 --> 36:42.514
[Gord] What the...

36:42.597 --> 36:43.932
What happened?

36:45.225 --> 36:47.227
Why didn't anyone take him down?

36:47.311 --> 36:48.687
Chuck told us not to touch him.

36:48.770 --> 36:50.730
- Chuck did this?
- Yeah.

36:50.814 --> 36:52.524
[Samantha] Harrison!

36:53.650 --> 36:56.778
Oh, quick, does anybody have any candy?
Sugar?

36:56.861 --> 36:58.405
Anything. He's diabetic.

36:58.488 --> 36:59.573
- Uh, here.
- Thank you.

36:59.656 --> 37:03.243
Okay, come on, buddy!
Okay.

37:03.327 --> 37:06.163
Harrison, can you hear me?
Harrison, come on.

37:08.123 --> 37:10.834
- Come on, please don't die. Harrison?
- What happened?

37:10.917 --> 37:13.002
He went into insulin shock.

37:13.087 --> 37:15.714
- [Samantha] Come on.
- I'm... I'm so sorry, I didn't know.

37:15.797 --> 37:18.342
Maybe you should've asked
before you strung him up.

37:20.635 --> 37:22.304
You did this?

37:26.799 --> 37:28.050
[door opens]

37:31.219 --> 37:34.264
You're damn lucky.
Harrison'll live.

37:35.223 --> 37:39.686
Come on, Gord. He stole a car,
smashed up the windows, spit in my face.

37:39.770 --> 37:41.939
The kids need to know
that they can't get away with this stuff.

37:42.022 --> 37:45.275
- And killing him is the answer?
- Oh, the righteous one.

37:45.358 --> 37:47.569
Yeah, sure, I meant to kill him.
Put that on me.

37:47.652 --> 37:50.238
But at least I'm trying to
keep order around here, Gord.

37:50.322 --> 37:51.573
What about you?

37:51.656 --> 37:53.491
Nobody made you judge and jury.

37:54.617 --> 37:57.329
Being rich...
doesn't make you right.

37:57.412 --> 37:59.664
I don't need to take this shit.

37:59.747 --> 38:00.958
Especially from you.

38:06.754 --> 38:08.465
Is that what she said?

38:08.548 --> 38:12.385
That's what I saw.
Ronnie attacked her.

38:13.303 --> 38:15.180
Where is he?

38:15.263 --> 38:18.308
He's with Jeff and Al.
They're keeping an eye on him for now.

38:19.434 --> 38:20.727
Pat, what are we gonna do?

38:21.728 --> 38:24.106
I honestly didn't think
he was wired that way.

38:24.189 --> 38:25.773
[scoffs]

38:25.858 --> 38:27.525
I was never so sure.

38:28.986 --> 38:30.278
How's Wiley?

38:31.279 --> 38:33.824
About as good as you'd be
after something like that.

38:46.169 --> 38:47.629
Jason.

39:07.690 --> 39:09.109
Rough day?

39:09.192 --> 39:13.155
[sighs] Yeah, you can say that.

39:13.238 --> 39:16.158
Well, if it helps, I spoke to Ronnie.

39:16.241 --> 39:17.825
He's truly sorry.

39:19.536 --> 39:20.913
It doesn't.

39:22.789 --> 39:24.374
Hey, do you mind
driving me to town?

39:24.457 --> 39:26.459
I think I've overstayed
my welcome here.

39:27.920 --> 39:30.380
Yeah, about that...

39:30.463 --> 39:31.673
I can't.

39:31.756 --> 39:33.884
Not yet.

39:33.967 --> 39:37.387
Okay, uh, just get me close.

39:37.470 --> 39:39.431
There's something
I need you to do for us first.

39:39.514 --> 39:41.766
And I don't see
any way around this.

39:50.275 --> 39:53.570
[Adam] I would've bet everything I own
that Pat killed Lana.

39:53.653 --> 39:55.906
I feel like such an idiot.

39:55.989 --> 39:57.908
[Ms. Symonds] All the evidence
pointed that way.

39:57.991 --> 40:00.077
What do you think is gonna happen?

40:00.911 --> 40:02.454
My guess?

40:02.537 --> 40:05.082
The Creekers come back...

40:05.165 --> 40:06.458
looking for blood.

40:06.541 --> 40:08.961
All bets are off if that happens.

40:10.003 --> 40:11.004
Yeah.

40:11.088 --> 40:13.131
- [breaker flipping]
- [all cheering]

40:17.844 --> 40:19.596
Power is back on.

40:22.765 --> 40:23.766
Ms. Symonds?

40:25.393 --> 40:27.938
Ms. Symonds! Amy!

40:28.021 --> 40:29.439
Amy?

40:44.704 --> 40:47.499
Looks like civilian life
is treating you well.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.252
[sighs]

40:59.219 --> 41:01.013
Morning, sunshine.

41:01.096 --> 41:02.764
[Mark] Is the interrogation over?

41:02.847 --> 41:05.350
If you're gonna kill me,
can we just get it over with?

41:05.433 --> 41:07.060
So besides this kid, Adam,

41:07.144 --> 41:09.896
there appears to be no one else
investigating what happened?

41:09.980 --> 41:11.148
No.

41:13.191 --> 41:16.819
There's a million theories,
but no one seems to know anything.

41:16.903 --> 41:19.447
I guess everyone figured
once the power came back on,

41:19.531 --> 41:21.366
there'd be a message or something.

41:21.449 --> 41:23.493
Don't even think about trying anything.

41:26.371 --> 41:27.747
[lock opening]

41:37.465 --> 41:39.551
I don't understand.
Why are you releasing me?

41:39.634 --> 41:41.803
I brought you back here as a warning.

41:41.886 --> 41:47.434
But now that you've proven to be useful,
I want you to be my eyes and ears in town.

41:47.517 --> 41:48.976
So I'm gonna forgive you
for punching me in the face,

41:49.061 --> 41:50.728
and I'm gonna give you
a second chance.

41:50.812 --> 41:52.730
There's not gonna be a third.

41:55.275 --> 41:57.194
Okay.

42:02.740 --> 42:03.950
Thanks.

42:08.955 --> 42:10.248
How old are you?

42:10.332 --> 42:12.167
Twenty-one.

42:12.959 --> 42:15.087
No offense,
but I could've sworn you were older.

42:15.170 --> 42:18.590
Then you'd be wrong...
and offensive.

42:26.931 --> 42:28.641
[door opens]

42:30.477 --> 42:34.231
I need intel on a kid named Adam Jones.
