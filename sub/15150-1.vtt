here yet?

02:51.986 --> 02:53.621
Hey, little sleepy head.

02:53.688 --> 02:55.088
Because I'm ready.

03:00.194 --> 03:02.980

03:31.092 --> 03:32.977
Just need that balloon
payment to unload.

03:33.044 --> 03:36.479
We have it. It's just they
called Troy from Titus last night.

03:36.547 --> 03:38.549
The ski place?

03:38.617 --> 03:42.519
Do you have
the $4,372 or not?

03:42.587 --> 03:45.906
It was some emergency
with the lift.

03:45.973 --> 03:47.407
And he just took
off out of here

03:47.475 --> 03:50.093
without thinking,
with the money.

03:50.162 --> 03:51.295
Completely forgot
you were coming.

03:51.363 --> 03:52.596
So as soon
as he gets back...

03:52.663 --> 03:55.099
When's he getting back?

03:55.166 --> 03:57.684
When you come with the other half,
I'll have it.

03:57.836 --> 04:01.087
You don't get the other half
until I get the cash.

04:01.155 --> 04:03.474
This is the second time
you've dragged me out here.

04:03.541 --> 04:05.509
If you can't come up
with it by Christmas,

04:05.576 --> 04:07.944
you've lost your
$1,500 deposit.

04:08.729 --> 04:11.098
Look, Mr. Versailles,

04:11.166 --> 04:13.650
I've got a good job
at Yankee One Dollar.

04:13.718 --> 04:16.420
They're probably going to make
me manager right after Christmas,

04:16.488 --> 04:19.189
so I can definitely
make the payments

04:19.257 --> 04:20.624
if you just leave
the house.

04:20.690 --> 04:24.195
Just call me when you have
the balloon payment.

04:27.032 --> 04:28.515
I'll call you.

04:37.058 --> 04:39.943
RICKY: Where are
they going?

04:40.011 --> 04:41.611
I'll get it back.
I promise.

04:51.656 --> 04:52.690
You got to get
ready for school.

04:52.757 --> 04:53.907
You're going to
miss the bus.

04:53.975 --> 04:56.143
I can get a job,
you know.

04:56.211 --> 04:57.628
You're 15, T.J.

04:57.696 --> 04:58.963
They won't ask
any questions.

04:59.030 --> 05:00.564
You're finishing school.

05:00.632 --> 05:01.665
Mom, you think
we can make a living

05:01.733 --> 05:03.667
on what you make
at Yankee Dollar?

05:04.952 --> 05:07.153
You're going to school.

05:07.221 --> 05:09.123
I bet I could make
more than you do.

05:19.150 --> 05:21.118
Aren't we even
going to look for him?

05:21.186 --> 05:23.003
I'm going to work,
and you're going to school.

05:23.071 --> 05:24.187
What, that's it?

05:24.255 --> 05:25.873
Where did he go?

05:25.940 --> 05:28.408
On a business trip.

05:28.476 --> 05:30.410
When is he coming home?

05:30.477 --> 05:31.795
I don't know, Ricky.

05:31.862 --> 05:34.431
I can't believe you're not
even going to look for him.

05:34.499 --> 05:35.866
Where? Where do I look?

05:35.934 --> 05:37.434
The reservation!

05:37.502 --> 05:40.270
He's probably
in Atlantic City by now.

05:41.906 --> 05:44.942
The glove compartment,
that was so stupid.
