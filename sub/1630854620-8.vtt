WEBVTT

00:03.741 --> 00:06.847
I love summertime!

00:06.847 --> 00:09.085
Oh, Honey, you got
to get in on this.

00:09.085 --> 00:11.557
I mean, if we're doing
stupid couple things,

00:11.557 --> 00:12.692
I guess--oh!

00:12.692 --> 00:13.828
Whoo!

00:13.828 --> 00:15.130
Right?
Whoo!

00:15.130 --> 00:16.667
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:16.667 --> 00:18.270
I hate to be that possum,

00:18.270 --> 00:19.305
but could you guys
keep it down?

00:19.305 --> 00:22.111
Trying to get
these dirt dumplings to sleep.

00:22.111 --> 00:24.048
Oh, hey, Possum.
How you doing?

00:24.048 --> 00:25.150
Ugh, you know kids.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.722
Cayden won't eat spiders,
Brayden only eats spiders,

00:27.722 --> 00:29.893
and Jayden's just an idiot.

00:29.893 --> 00:31.095
It's exhausting.

00:31.095 --> 00:32.264
If you need a night off,

00:32.264 --> 00:33.935
we could babysit
those ugly little dudes.

00:33.935 --> 00:35.304
Chief, we wouldn't
want to impose.

00:35.304 --> 00:36.840
Please , we insist.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.278
I insist that we not insist.

00:39.278 --> 00:41.282
I might take
you guys up on that.

00:41.282 --> 00:43.754
Life's been hard
since my mate was run over

00:43.754 --> 00:45.190
by that electric scooter--

00:45.190 --> 00:49.265
Oh, my God!
Why is life so unfair?

00:49.265 --> 00:50.635
He's talking
about the sprinkler

00:50.635 --> 00:51.604
shutting off, isn't he?

00:51.604 --> 00:52.772
'Fraid so.

00:52.772 --> 00:54.041
No!

00:57.081 --> 00:58.517

00:58.517 --> 01:00.888

Ahh.

01:30.147 --> 01:34.255
Hey, who put itching powder
in my sleeping bag?

01:35.892 --> 01:37.227
Ahh, Honey!

01:37.227 --> 01:39.065
I've got a giant tick!

01:39.065 --> 01:42.839
That's not a tick.
It's a baby possum.

01:42.839 --> 01:44.509
It's all six babies.

01:44.610 --> 01:47.949
Papa Possum obviously
took you up on your offer.

01:47.949 --> 01:50.253
I didn't mean tonight.

01:50.253 --> 01:53.426
I meant, wait a few months
and forget we ever talked.

01:53.426 --> 01:55.197
Doesn't he know
how favors work?

01:55.197 --> 01:56.734
Well, now we
don't have a choice.

01:56.734 --> 01:59.372
These motherless little cretins
with ghoulish eyes

01:59.372 --> 02:02.812
and no fur on their weird
scaly tails need us.

02:02.812 --> 02:04.583
Aw, you're right.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.555
Anyway, I think tonight's
your night with the kids.

02:08.524 --> 02:10.828
You're always like,
"We can do this.

02:10.828 --> 02:12.164
"We would love to help.

02:12.164 --> 02:13.567
We will be there
with bells on."

02:14.268 --> 02:16.039
But "we" really means me!

02:16.039 --> 02:18.209
What?
When has that ever happened?

02:18.209 --> 02:19.980
"Of course, Raccoon,

02:19.980 --> 02:23.219
we'd love to see
your one mammal show!"

02:23.219 --> 02:26.259
All those years trying
to be good enough,

02:26.259 --> 02:29.833
but I was never gonna be
good enough, was I, old man?

02:29.833 --> 02:33.206
No, you're soft!

02:33.206 --> 02:34.375
Oh, where's Chief?

02:34.475 --> 02:36.580
<i>You got this, Honey. Improvise.</i>

02:36.580 --> 02:39.118
Oh, he never had any intention
of coming.

02:39.118 --> 02:41.790
I was waiting until he was
out of previews.

02:41.790 --> 02:43.994
You're the one
who gets us into trouble.

02:43.994 --> 02:45.832
I'm the one who gets us out.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.434
Unless you'd like to step up

02:47.434 --> 02:49.405
and take responsibility
for this one.

02:49.405 --> 02:51.710
Nah, you got this.
Good night.

02:51.710 --> 02:53.179
Snore, snore, snore.

02:53.179 --> 02:55.150
It just feels like
all the cats in my house

02:55.150 --> 02:56.285
have a thing, you know?

02:56.285 --> 02:58.924
The athletic one's athletic,
the mashed potato one

02:59.025 --> 03:00.561
loves '50s dance crazes.

03:00.561 --> 03:03.299
I'm just the Gray One?
- Shh, shh, shh.

03:03.299 --> 03:04.636
Yeah, you're right.

03:04.636 --> 03:07.207
Who do I think I am,
the interesting one?

03:07.207 --> 03:08.410
Keep your voice down,
Gray One.

03:08.410 --> 03:10.848
I just finally got
these monsters to sleep.

03:12.552 --> 03:15.390
Balancing work and one day
of childcare is not easy.

03:15.390 --> 03:17.094
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

03:17.094 --> 03:19.165
What is that smell?

03:19.165 --> 03:21.770
There's a massive turd
on your shell, Shel!

03:21.770 --> 03:23.306
What?
Again?

03:23.306 --> 03:25.010
Ew, you poop
on your own back?

03:25.010 --> 03:26.947
Let's not kink shame.

03:26.947 --> 03:28.684
I didn't do it.
You see,

03:28.684 --> 03:30.922
In summer, I like to sleep

03:30.922 --> 03:32.357
<i>beneath the starry sky</i>

03:32.357 --> 03:34.796
<i>to soak up erotic energy
from the cosmos.</i>

03:34.796 --> 03:36.065
<i>But recently,</i>

03:36.065 --> 03:41.643
<i>some fecal felon has turned me
into his upside-down bedpan.</i>

03:42.879 --> 03:46.854
<i>And that garden gnome just
stands there and does nothing.</i>

03:46.854 --> 03:50.460
What good is that creep
if he's not watching my back?

03:50.460 --> 03:53.667
I think we all know
who's responsible for this,

03:53.667 --> 03:55.237
a nocturnal!

03:55.237 --> 03:57.107
Ugh, nocturnal animals

03:57.107 --> 03:58.911
are what
the day scrapes off its shoe

03:58.911 --> 04:00.113
when it goes to bed at night.

04:00.113 --> 04:02.050
You guys know
I'm nocturnal, right?

04:02.050 --> 04:04.255
Absolutely.
You're terrifying.

04:04.355 --> 04:05.958
Uh, which animals
are nocturnal again?

04:05.958 --> 04:07.194
Skunks, bats--

04:07.194 --> 04:08.697
- Jared Leto.
- Owls--

04:08.697 --> 04:10.802
Owls?

04:10.802 --> 04:12.271
Good night, Grandpa.

04:12.271 --> 04:15.143
When I'm close to you,
nothing bad can ever happen.

04:15.143 --> 04:16.814
Ahh!

04:18.183 --> 04:21.122
How about a good night kiss
for Grandpa?

04:21.122 --> 04:22.592
Ahh!

04:22.592 --> 04:23.259
Ahh!

04:23.259 --> 04:25.798
Nocturnals are monsters!

04:25.798 --> 04:26.967
They're monsters, I say!

04:26.967 --> 04:30.207
Well, let's not let one bad
owl spoil the whole bunch.

04:30.207 --> 04:32.211
Just because the nocturnal
world is different

04:32.211 --> 04:33.647
doesn't mean it's bad.

04:33.647 --> 04:35.985
I mean, look at
my precious little nightmares.

04:37.087 --> 04:38.591
Aww!

04:38.591 --> 04:41.530
Totes adorbs yawns
will not sway me.

04:41.530 --> 04:45.103
Those nocturnals are all
vicious bowel hounds.

04:45.103 --> 04:47.909
But what's a TILF
like me to do?

04:47.909 --> 04:49.679
Vigilante justice!

04:49.679 --> 04:52.919
I say we stay up all night
and catch this poop-etrator

04:52.919 --> 04:54.656
in the act and make them pay!

04:54.656 --> 04:56.693
It's more my style
to put up with it

04:56.693 --> 04:59.966
and then settle my score
with a scathing memoir.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.972
I can't believe he's pushing
back on this stopping someone

05:02.972 --> 05:04.576
from pooping on him idea.

05:04.576 --> 05:07.147
Considering none
of my enemies can read,

05:07.147 --> 05:08.851
we'll give your way a try.

05:08.851 --> 05:09.920
Whee!

05:09.920 --> 05:11.523
We're going on a stakeout!

05:11.523 --> 05:13.627
Did someone
leave a steak out?

05:13.627 --> 05:14.328
No?

05:14.328 --> 05:17.000
Aww, all right.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.073
Is that bum truffle spoken for?

05:20.073 --> 05:22.579
Oh my, look who's up.

05:22.579 --> 05:25.317
Well, good morning--
or good evening.

05:25.417 --> 05:27.555
Precious little opposites.

05:27.555 --> 05:29.391
Ow, ow, ow!

05:29.391 --> 05:31.128
Time out, time out!
No, it's me.

05:31.128 --> 05:32.297
It's Aunt Honey.
Son of a--

05:54.074 --> 05:55.243
Who is that?

05:55.243 --> 05:58.617
It's a shell decoy I made
from an upside-down tostada!

05:58.617 --> 06:01.557
We just hide behind here,
and we catch them in the act.

06:01.557 --> 06:05.263
This tostada tortoise--
or tor-stada if you will--

06:05.263 --> 06:06.567
I won't.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.504
It lacks
my authentic sex appeal.

06:08.504 --> 06:11.944
It would never be mistaken
for the real me.

06:11.944 --> 06:13.881
Not tonight, Shel.

06:13.881 --> 06:15.317
I'm exhausted.

06:15.317 --> 06:17.589
Trust me,
this BM bandit will be back.

06:17.589 --> 06:19.358
And when we catch him,
we're gonna rip--

06:19.358 --> 06:20.427
Are you sleeping?

06:20.427 --> 06:22.832
Ah, ah--oh.

06:24.034 --> 06:25.605
Ugh.

06:25.605 --> 06:29.211
A little pee-pee
then back to sleepy.

06:30.247 --> 06:32.217
Oh, no.
I'm locked out!

06:35.190 --> 06:38.831
Here lies Diablo,
eaten by an owl?

06:38.831 --> 06:41.536
How come I can only read
in my nightmares?

06:41.637 --> 06:44.208
- Kiss me!
- Ahh!

06:44.843 --> 06:50.420
And eventually, we will have
danced out all our sillies.

06:50.420 --> 06:51.924
Keep dancing.

06:51.924 --> 06:54.996
I'm just gonna rest my eyes
for one quick second.

06:54.996 --> 06:57.100
Auntie Honey's watching.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.804
Nice moves, Jayden.

06:58.804 --> 07:00.040
That's it.

07:02.344 --> 07:03.514
Wait, what!

07:03.514 --> 07:05.383
How long was that blink?

07:05.383 --> 07:08.189
Sweeties, smushies!

07:08.189 --> 07:10.126
Hideous night creatures?

07:10.126 --> 07:11.563
Did I just lose them?

07:11.563 --> 07:13.499
Is this what
failure feels like?

07:13.499 --> 07:15.571
Oh, poor Chief.

07:19.011 --> 07:21.650
Where are you,
wretched little darlings?

07:21.750 --> 07:22.451
Honey?

07:22.585 --> 07:24.188
I closed my eyes
for one second,

07:24.188 --> 07:25.457
and now the babies are gone.

07:25.558 --> 07:27.829
How could you?

07:27.829 --> 07:31.035
Did you consider how poorly
this might reflect on me?

07:31.035 --> 07:32.070
What?

07:32.070 --> 07:33.607
I promised Papa Possum

07:33.607 --> 07:35.711
that we would take care
of his kids!

07:35.711 --> 07:37.447
Guess it's time
for Chief to clean up

07:37.447 --> 07:38.684
Honey's mess for once.

07:38.684 --> 07:40.788
Chief, nothing
would make me happier,

07:40.788 --> 07:43.326
but cleaning up messes
isn't really your brand.

07:43.426 --> 07:45.330
Yeah, my brand is bad boy chic

07:45.430 --> 07:47.702
But I can diversify.
I'll find them.

07:47.702 --> 07:49.539
You couldn't
find your own tail.

07:49.539 --> 07:52.177
It's right--

07:52.177 --> 07:54.481
Oh, hey, man.

07:54.481 --> 07:56.052
Okay, Shel.

07:56.052 --> 07:58.323
This guy will have something
to put some pep in your step.

07:58.323 --> 07:59.425
Well, if you don't
have insurance,

07:59.425 --> 08:00.695
you can just pay me in lint.

08:00.695 --> 08:03.166
All I've got is
this creepy doll's head.

08:03.166 --> 08:04.168
Deal.

08:04.168 --> 08:05.403
Next.

08:05.403 --> 08:06.640
Listen, my partner
here needs some help

08:06.640 --> 08:07.675
in the stamina department.

08:07.675 --> 08:10.480
Suffering from a bit
of e-reptile dysfunction?

08:12.017 --> 08:13.620
Oh, of course not.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.323
Let's put a pin in that.

08:15.323 --> 08:16.626
I'll come back tomorrow.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.564
We need him
to stay awake all night.

08:18.564 --> 08:20.868
Well, drawing on my wealth
of medical expertise,

08:20.868 --> 08:23.039
I'd say...

08:23.039 --> 08:24.909
oh, that's a good one.

08:24.909 --> 08:26.479
Oh, here!

08:26.479 --> 08:28.483
Uh, what the hell is this?

08:28.483 --> 08:30.387
My current side hustle
is Big Pharma.

08:30.387 --> 08:31.890
Welcome to Nite Aid.

08:31.890 --> 08:34.495
Okay, I just need some
guidance from a nocturnal.

08:34.495 --> 08:36.232
This isn't
an information booth.

08:36.232 --> 08:37.401
Buy something or get out.

08:37.401 --> 08:38.737
Nibbles!

08:38.737 --> 08:40.508
Will you please help me
find those baby possums?

08:40.508 --> 08:42.979
No, Shel and I are
vengeance seeking missiles,

08:42.979 --> 08:45.651
and nothing's gonna
knock us off course!

08:45.651 --> 08:47.487
There is a vacant house
that's recently

08:47.588 --> 08:48.857
been overtaken by possums.

08:48.857 --> 08:50.995
Look, I'm as liberal
as the next dog,

08:50.995 --> 08:54.168
but when you vote for Prop 625,
that's what you get.

08:54.168 --> 08:55.336
But take me there.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.176
You're fine, just ignore it.

08:58.176 --> 09:00.447
Nibbles, I've got to say,

09:00.447 --> 09:02.618
I'm more
than a little disappointed

09:02.618 --> 09:05.090
in this so-called energy pill.

09:05.090 --> 09:06.526
Give me another.

09:06.526 --> 09:09.899
No, give me all of them.

09:09.999 --> 09:12.137
I'm starting
to think that raccoon

09:12.137 --> 09:14.007
is not really a pharma--

09:14.108 --> 09:15.477
ooh!

09:15.477 --> 09:18.416
Wha-ha!

09:18.416 --> 09:21.288
We meet again, Mega-Shel!

09:21.288 --> 09:23.059
Mothra.

09:25.163 --> 09:26.566
See you in shell!

09:30.473 --> 09:32.678
Roar!

09:32.678 --> 09:34.415
Out of my way, fence!

09:35.951 --> 09:38.122
That's what you get
for standing in his way, bitch!

09:40.661 --> 09:41.797
Okay, let's see.

09:41.797 --> 09:45.738
Skunk house,
bat house, meth house--

09:45.738 --> 09:47.975
Bingo!
Possum house.

09:51.983 --> 09:54.522
Hi, I'm looking
for some missing possum babies.

09:54.522 --> 09:56.158
It's okay.
I'm a therapist.

09:57.260 --> 09:58.997
Are there any in here
that you don't recognize?

09:58.997 --> 10:01.670
We ain't possums, poodle.
we're opossums.

10:01.670 --> 10:04.609
But I guess we're all the same
to you day critters.

10:04.709 --> 10:07.414
No, no, I'm cool.
I have a hamster friend.

10:07.414 --> 10:09.451
You think I don't
know my own kids,

10:09.451 --> 10:11.355
just 'cause I got 30 or 40
of them?

10:11.355 --> 10:12.658
That's it.

10:12.658 --> 10:14.562
Kids, we're having dog
for dinner tonight.

10:14.562 --> 10:16.232
Whoa, whoa, hold on!

10:16.232 --> 10:17.467
Sorry about my friend.

10:17.467 --> 10:20.073
House pets can be
such Karens, right?

10:20.073 --> 10:21.275
I'm the Gray One.

10:21.275 --> 10:24.849
I live just up the street
in the overtaken by cats house.

10:24.849 --> 10:26.753
Hey, what's the story
with your human?

10:26.753 --> 10:29.291
Legally insane but lovely.

10:29.291 --> 10:30.460
Yours?
- We ate him.

10:31.596 --> 10:33.734
That is the dream.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.671
The poodle's with me.
You can trust her.

10:35.671 --> 10:37.007
Thanks, Gray One.

10:37.007 --> 10:38.777
I'm just worried
about the possum babies.

10:38.877 --> 10:40.815
If I don't find them,
it'll make it a lot harder

10:40.815 --> 10:42.585
to condescend to my partner.

10:42.585 --> 10:44.488
I'd check out
the Beefy Burgers Fun Time

10:44.488 --> 10:46.760
Happy Clown Fun Zone for Kids.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.031
Thank you.
Sorry for the mix-up.

10:49.031 --> 10:50.734
And I'm sorry
for threatening to feed

10:50.734 --> 10:52.103
your friend to my family.

10:52.103 --> 10:55.176
Oh, so I guess we'll feed
the kids your good deeds

10:55.176 --> 10:56.145
for dinner tonight.

10:56.145 --> 10:57.949
You remember how you
told me to remind you

10:57.949 --> 10:59.652
when you're being
like your mother?

10:59.652 --> 11:02.357
Well, you're being
like your mother!

11:02.357 --> 11:05.898
Babies!

11:05.898 --> 11:09.639
If you come back, you can
sleep in my big comfy bed!

11:09.639 --> 11:13.379
Raid the fridge!
Help me topple the matriarchy!

11:13.379 --> 11:14.682
Big comfy bed?

11:14.682 --> 11:16.586
Food?
Follow my lead.

11:16.586 --> 11:19.491
Hey, it's us, the babies!

11:19.491 --> 11:21.328
Yeah, babies!

11:21.328 --> 11:22.632
Ya-ga-goo-goo.

11:22.632 --> 11:24.636
Oh!

11:24.636 --> 11:27.040
You are the babies!

11:27.040 --> 11:28.209
I did it!

11:28.209 --> 11:31.315
But let's try to be sensitive
when I rub Honey's smug,

11:31.315 --> 11:32.818
responsible nose in it.

11:32.818 --> 11:35.156
Hey real quick,
what species are we again?

11:35.156 --> 11:37.494
- Possums!
- Oh, yeah, yeah, we knew that.

11:37.494 --> 11:39.431
Real marsupial-like.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.715
Di-eureka!

11:47.715 --> 11:50.654
It's public enemy number two!

11:51.790 --> 11:54.494
Step away from the tostada.

12:02.612 --> 12:05.116
Mario Kart me!

12:06.352 --> 12:08.890
♪ Do-do-do-do, de-de-de-de,
do-do-do-do, de-de-de-de ♪

12:08.890 --> 12:11.630
♪ Do-do-do-do, de-de-de-de ♪
- Ah!

12:11.730 --> 12:12.865
No, I didn't do anything.

12:12.865 --> 12:15.203
I was just hungry.
I'm a foodie.

12:15.203 --> 12:16.305
Good!

12:16.305 --> 12:19.646
So you'll enjoy it
when I feed you your own ass!

12:19.646 --> 12:21.115
Whoa, Shel!

12:21.115 --> 12:24.656
Listen, my partner's
apparently a real loose cannon,

12:24.656 --> 12:27.093
so why not make this easy
and admit

12:27.093 --> 12:28.697
that you're
the dookie delinquent

12:28.697 --> 12:29.966
who dumped on his shell?

12:29.966 --> 12:32.605
What?
No, it couldn't have been me.

12:32.605 --> 12:33.774
I just make little pellets.

12:33.774 --> 12:36.947
They'd roll right
off that shell of yours.

12:36.947 --> 12:39.919
Checks out.
Might have to let him go.

12:40.019 --> 12:42.257
Oh, my God.
I'm good cop?

12:42.257 --> 12:45.798
You tell all
your day sleeper creeper pals,

12:45.898 --> 12:48.469
there's a new sheriff in town--

12:48.469 --> 12:51.743
and he's done a lot of drugs!

12:51.743 --> 12:53.747
<i>Wow, this place is hopping.</i>

12:53.747 --> 12:55.918
Rodents, raccoons, roaches--

12:55.918 --> 12:58.089
everything their burgers
are probably made of.

12:58.089 --> 13:00.226
Ooh, let's search
the ball pit.

13:00.226 --> 13:01.495
Kids love those.

13:03.265 --> 13:05.003
Uh, babies?

13:05.003 --> 13:08.242
Do you hear those sounds?

13:08.242 --> 13:09.912
Uh, babies?

13:09.912 --> 13:12.718
Not yet,
but we're making them.

13:12.718 --> 13:15.758
No, everyone
in here is procreating!

13:15.758 --> 13:18.530
Licks,
get your psychotropic licks.

13:18.530 --> 13:19.866
Oh good, a local businessman.

13:19.866 --> 13:22.337
Sir, sir?
- Nice try, narc.

13:22.337 --> 13:23.507
Uh, I got this.

13:23.507 --> 13:24.842
Hey, Cane!

13:24.842 --> 13:26.613
You haven't seen six possum
babies in here, have you?

13:26.613 --> 13:29.552
Hm, follow me.

13:29.552 --> 13:32.591
Hard pass, sir.

13:34.629 --> 13:35.931
So you know where
the babies are?

13:35.931 --> 13:37.835
No, but I know
who would know--

13:37.835 --> 13:39.338
the Night Knight.

13:39.338 --> 13:40.173
The Night Night?

13:40.273 --> 13:41.710
Yeah, the second
Knight is with a K.

13:41.710 --> 13:43.112
He's the king
of the nocturnals.

13:43.112 --> 13:44.782
When the sun goes down,
the Night Knight

13:44.782 --> 13:46.986
runs everything--
the sewers, the dumpsters,

13:46.986 --> 13:48.422
this sex-positive play pit.

13:48.422 --> 13:51.295
Those possums of yours?
They're working for him now.

13:51.295 --> 13:53.934
But they're just
innocent little babies.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.405
If anything happened to them,
I wouldn't be able

13:56.405 --> 13:57.340
to live with myself.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.746
At home, with Chief
rubbing it in my face.

13:59.746 --> 14:01.348
We have to find them!

14:01.348 --> 14:02.818
- Honey.
- Diablo?

14:02.818 --> 14:05.089
What are you doing out here
all by yourself?

14:05.089 --> 14:06.760
I got locked out of my house.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.297
I'm terrified!
Tell me I'm overreacting!

14:09.297 --> 14:11.870
I can't.
You're exactly right reacting.

14:11.870 --> 14:14.642
I've seen things tonight--
horrible things.

14:14.642 --> 14:16.679
But as long
as we stick together,

14:16.679 --> 14:17.848
nothing can harm us.

14:17.848 --> 14:18.884
Ahh!

14:18.884 --> 14:20.053
Honey, you just said--

14:20.053 --> 14:21.823
I know!
I was wrong!

14:21.823 --> 14:23.960
I hope you're happy!

14:26.065 --> 14:28.503
Excuse me, miss?
I got a quick pitch.

14:28.503 --> 14:29.505
You can take it or leave it.

14:29.505 --> 14:30.808
What if you didn't eat me?

14:30.808 --> 14:33.513
Silence!
Enjoy this flight.

14:33.513 --> 14:34.982
It'll be the last for you.

14:34.982 --> 14:37.688
Well, these are
your final moments, Diablo.

14:37.688 --> 14:40.393
You better take it all in.

14:40.393 --> 14:41.328
Wow!

14:41.462 --> 14:44.468
The night doesn't seem
as scary from up here.

14:44.468 --> 14:45.470
It's beautiful!

14:45.637 --> 14:49.144
The moonlight dancing
on the above-ground jacuzzis

14:49.144 --> 14:52.718
as the stars flicker like
a million smartphones

14:52.718 --> 14:53.920
on the fritz!

14:53.920 --> 14:55.356
Are you a poet?

14:55.356 --> 14:56.225
I dabble.

14:56.391 --> 14:58.530
Miss Owl, can we keep
flying for a little bit?

14:58.530 --> 14:59.766
Very well.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.068
Before you are consumed,

I'm still amped
from threatening

16:13.513 --> 16:14.749
that flying squirrel.

16:14.749 --> 16:16.653
I want to learn how
to roller skate.

16:16.653 --> 16:17.755
Have you ever chewed gum?

16:17.755 --> 16:19.491
Do I have horns?

16:19.491 --> 16:20.627
That's them.

16:20.727 --> 16:22.598
They're the ones that wouldn't
let me eat that tor-stada!

16:22.598 --> 16:24.635
Well, well, new sheriff.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.004
We got your message.

16:26.004 --> 16:28.008
Hey, back off of the turtle!

16:28.008 --> 16:30.714
Oh, brought in
your day critter goons, huh?

16:30.714 --> 16:31.850
Creepy creatures with--

16:31.850 --> 16:33.452
You guys are the creepy ones!

16:33.452 --> 16:36.225
Honey's gross
generalizations are right.

16:36.325 --> 16:39.532
Day versus night
fight to the death!

16:43.807 --> 16:45.711
The drugs are wearing off!

16:45.711 --> 16:48.082
Day versus night cuddle puddle?

16:48.082 --> 16:52.490
Uhh! Stop, we haven't
established a safe word!

16:52.490 --> 16:53.994
Honey!
Gray One!

16:53.994 --> 16:55.697
Other friends!
Whoo!

16:55.697 --> 16:57.902
Diablo!
Oh, you're okay!

16:57.902 --> 17:00.206
Let's rip
that owl's throat out!

17:00.206 --> 17:02.310
No, no, no,
this owl is my friend!

17:02.310 --> 17:04.214
We had a beautiful
night together.

17:04.214 --> 17:07.120
I saw two badgers find love.
I sang a duet.

17:07.120 --> 17:09.391
I learned our city has
a major possum problem.

17:09.391 --> 17:11.963
- Possums?
- Yeah, they were everywhere.

17:11.963 --> 17:13.299
Well, not everywhere.

17:13.399 --> 17:15.236
Mainly dumpsters pilfering
discarded pharmaceuticals.

17:15.236 --> 17:16.973
Damn this opioid epidemic!

17:16.973 --> 17:18.375
Pharmaceuticals?

17:18.375 --> 17:21.148
That means they must
be working for--

17:21.248 --> 17:24.254
both: Raccoon!
Raccoon is the Night Knight!

17:24.254 --> 17:26.759
I was right there with you--
maybe slightly before.

17:26.759 --> 17:28.295
So he's got the babies!

17:28.295 --> 17:30.299
Are you talking
about possum sextuplets?

17:30.299 --> 17:32.738
Yeah, we've been looking
for them all night.

17:32.738 --> 17:34.241
Hey!

17:34.241 --> 17:36.011
If you day critters are trying
to help those night babies,

17:36.011 --> 17:37.648
then maybe we shouldn't
disembowel you.

17:37.648 --> 17:40.887
And if a friendship can form
between an owl and a dog--

17:40.887 --> 17:43.025
Dog?
Well, that can't be right.

17:43.025 --> 17:44.795
Then maybe we can
all work together

17:44.795 --> 17:46.966
and save those babies!

17:46.966 --> 17:48.904
- Yeah!
- Now let's move out!

17:58.155 --> 18:00.794
Target locked in!
Go, go, go!

18:15.122 --> 18:17.995
Ooh, sounds like
my little drug runners got

18:17.995 --> 18:19.665
more pills
for Papa Night Knight--

18:19.665 --> 18:20.968
dang it!

18:20.968 --> 18:22.370
Pretty tidy confession there.

18:22.370 --> 18:25.677
How could you use
these repulsive little cherubs

18:25.677 --> 18:27.046
as drug smugglers?

18:27.046 --> 18:29.619
Okay, first off,
check your dog privilege.

18:29.619 --> 18:32.256
Not every creature gets
to live in a cushy house.

18:32.256 --> 18:34.294
I was teaching them
survival skills--

18:34.294 --> 18:36.566
plus sextupling my inventory.

18:36.566 --> 18:38.536
Huh, never would have
thought of it that way.

18:38.536 --> 18:41.375
We creatures, night and day,
must never judge

18:41.375 --> 18:43.212
that which we don't understand.

18:43.212 --> 18:45.817
Wow, Nibbles,
that was oddly rational.

18:45.817 --> 18:47.353
Ugh, I know.

18:47.353 --> 18:49.024
Hanging out with Shel
is really bringing out

18:49.024 --> 18:50.727
the best in me.

18:50.727 --> 18:52.163
Oh, Honey!

18:52.163 --> 18:54.034
I found the babies!

18:54.134 --> 18:55.269
Ha-ha!

18:55.269 --> 18:56.806
Did not see this coming,
did you, Honey?

18:56.806 --> 18:59.812
Did you?
Respectfully.

18:59.812 --> 19:01.481
No, this is a real surprise.

19:01.481 --> 19:04.755
I did not expect you
to come back with four rats.

19:04.855 --> 19:06.224
In your f--rats?

19:06.224 --> 19:08.062
Jig's up, boy-os.

19:08.062 --> 19:09.431
Let's am-scray.

19:09.431 --> 19:11.969
What?
How did I not see that?

19:11.969 --> 19:14.240
You were right, Honey.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.981
You're the responsible one,
and I'm the eye candy.

19:17.981 --> 19:19.250
Chief.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.254
After a night of losing
the possum babies

19:21.355 --> 19:23.626
to an underground
pharmaceutical crime syndicate

19:23.626 --> 19:26.331
and enduring several
other disgusting surprises,

19:26.331 --> 19:28.435
including the Gray One
being helpful--

19:28.435 --> 19:31.141
Maybe I should change my name
to the Helpful One!

19:31.141 --> 19:32.410
Do whatever you want.

19:32.410 --> 19:35.216
The point is, Chief,
you being consistently you

19:35.216 --> 19:37.086
is just what I needed.

19:37.086 --> 19:39.825
Thank you.

19:41.061 --> 19:43.332
Was that fecal
matter landing--

19:43.332 --> 19:45.537
all: On top of the tor-stada?

19:45.537 --> 19:48.910
I was right there with you,
maybe slightly before.

19:48.910 --> 19:51.114
Possum?
- Honey, Chief!

19:51.114 --> 19:52.785
Thank you so much
for watching the kids.

19:52.785 --> 19:54.287
It was our pleasure.

19:54.287 --> 19:56.592
They were grotesquely adorable.

19:56.592 --> 19:59.799
Nothing at all like old rats.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.905
Why were you pooping
on that innocent tor-stada?

20:02.905 --> 20:04.374
I can explain.

20:04.374 --> 20:07.948
Usually, my only me time is
right at the end of the night

20:07.948 --> 20:09.585
when I finally
put the kids down

20:09.585 --> 20:13.158
and get to take a satisfying
dump on this turtle statue.

20:13.158 --> 20:14.628
Newsflash, pal!

20:14.628 --> 20:16.699
You haven't been
plop dropping on a statue!

20:16.699 --> 20:19.337
You've been squirting nuggets
on my partner!

20:19.337 --> 20:21.609
Hey, my rage is back!

20:21.609 --> 20:24.247
Easy, partner,
I'll try this my way.

20:24.247 --> 20:26.284
If I'm picking up what
you're laying down,

20:26.284 --> 20:29.925
this is your weird thing
that sounds disgusting

20:29.925 --> 20:31.361
but gives you pleasure?

20:31.361 --> 20:35.136
- You totally get me.
- I do, possum brother.

20:35.136 --> 20:38.108
You know what?
I'll see you tomorrow night.

20:38.108 --> 20:41.148
Go to town.

20:41.148 --> 20:45.055
♪ It's just
a precious sight ♪

20:45.055 --> 20:48.195
♪ On wings of the ♪

20:48.295 --> 20:54.542
Ahh!
both: ♪ Night ♪

21:01.956 --> 21:04.127
Do we need batteries?

21:04.127 --> 21:07.166
Well, why would
we need batteries?

21:09.204 --> 21:10.574
I don't know.

21:10.574 --> 21:13.278
I thought you said
we needed batteries.

21:13.278 --> 21:15.650
I just have this one thing.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.220
Did you bring
your Nite Aid card?

21:17.220 --> 21:19.424
Oh... did I?

21:19.525 --> 21:22.998
Can I give you
a number instead?

21:22.998 --> 21:24.902
I guess.

21:24.902 --> 21:29.912
Um, four...

21:29.912 --> 21:32.016
Does anyone else work here?
