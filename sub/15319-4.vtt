WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.356
Just don't give me
the new era speech again.

00:03.381 --> 00:04.580
Dude, it is totally new era.

00:04.886 --> 00:06.253
Thanks to Addison
and the U.N.,

00:06.255 --> 00:07.521
we have no commercial
banking access,

00:07.523 --> 00:07.588
We have no military
or law enforcement support.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.293
It is cold in here,
or is it just me?

00:12.295 --> 00:14.562
We also have no love
from the mayor's office,

00:14.564 --> 00:15.992
which means no breaks
on our heating bills

00:15.994 --> 00:17.317
or property taxes.

00:17.319 --> 00:18.320
Really?

00:18.322 --> 00:19.454
Really.

00:19.456 --> 00:20.418
Oh, man.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.951
Abby's coming over
for lunch today.

00:21.953 --> 00:23.654
We're celebrating
her big promotion.

00:23.656 --> 00:25.552
And I bought
all this gourmet food

00:25.554 --> 00:26.921
and those sea salt chocolates
you told me about--

00:26.923 --> 00:28.191
All right,
I'll fix the heating.

00:28.193 --> 00:29.161
Thank you.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.000
I will save you
some chicken.

00:31.002 --> 00:32.604
I'm getting paid
in chicken now.

00:32.607 --> 00:33.573
Actually,
it could be worse.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.441
Yeah, sure it could.

00:34.443 --> 00:36.047
Think about Magnus.

00:36.049 --> 00:37.185
Yeah, so what's
the deal with Africa?

00:37.187 --> 00:38.487
Why not Switzerland,
or Monaco,

00:38.489 --> 00:39.321
or wherever
this guy's from?

00:39.323 --> 00:41.128
She didn't tell you?

00:41.130 --> 00:44.267
This guy, Feliz,
he lives on his plane.

00:44.269 --> 00:45.002
Shut up!

00:45.004 --> 00:46.341
Yeah, yeah.

00:46.343 --> 00:47.444
He sends you the coordinates
of some landing spot

00:47.446 --> 00:49.048
24 hours in advance.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.383
In this case,

00:50.385 --> 00:52.720
it's some lawless island
off the coast of Mozambique.

00:52.722 --> 00:54.525
So he never stays
in one place for long.

00:54.527 --> 00:55.726
No.

00:55.728 --> 00:57.798
How "Bond villain"
is that?

00:57.800 --> 00:58.765
So, he's our guy now?

00:58.767 --> 01:00.231
Yeah, yeah.

01:00.233 --> 01:01.532
If you want something kept
hidden or off the grid,

01:01.534 --> 01:02.667
Richard Feliz is your man.

01:02.669 --> 01:04.269
He's our underground ally.

01:04.271 --> 01:06.207
Lawless island.

01:06.209 --> 01:07.408
That sounds dodgy.

01:07.410 --> 01:08.310
Aw, come on,

01:08.312 --> 01:09.512
for "bullets
and leather" Magnus?

01:09.514 --> 01:10.614
She can handle it.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.331
<i>Votre attention,</i>
<i>s'il vous plait...</i>

01:21.333 --> 01:23.833
You're welcome.

01:23.835 --> 01:26.669
<i>...Voulez-vous presenter</i>
<i>au comptoir d'embarquement...</i>

01:26.671 --> 01:29.104
So, you come here often?

01:30.407 --> 01:32.774
Whatever fantasies you have
about you and I

01:32.776 --> 01:34.275
are not
going to happen.

01:34.277 --> 01:35.343
Oh, come on, now.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.577
I have to know
your story.

01:36.579 --> 01:37.778
From what I understand,
women like to tell it.

01:37.780 --> 01:40.180
Brad Sylvester.

01:40.182 --> 01:43.616
You have a lot of experience
with women, Mr. Sylvester?

01:43.618 --> 01:45.551
Enough.

01:46.853 --> 01:51.458
You know, just being friendly
with a fellow traveler.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.527
CEO, Day-and-Night-Poker.

01:53.529 --> 01:56.364
You look like a woman
who enjoys games.

01:57.866 --> 01:58.900
<i>Really?</i>

02:02.339 --> 02:03.439
Enjoy the weather.

02:03.441 --> 02:06.541
It changes
all the time.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.810
Yes, I've-
I've been to Africa before.

02:13.549 --> 02:15.450
Photographer.
Canadian Press,

02:15.452 --> 02:17.618
and I promise,
I will <i> not</i> hit on you.

02:17.620 --> 02:18.986
But only because

02:18.988 --> 02:20.621
I've got a killer
deadline to meet.

02:20.623 --> 02:22.222
Good enough reason.

02:24.359 --> 02:27.260
Yes, no,
I cannot have the Irish Hammer

02:27.262 --> 02:28.394
fighting Hebrew Mick

02:28.396 --> 02:30.430
at Caesar's on this date.

02:30.432 --> 02:31.832
Why, Vasili? Why?
<i>Da</i> , conflict.

02:31.834 --> 02:34.401
Also, we have fashion show.

02:34.403 --> 02:37.704
Yes, women with large, eh...
sash, bathing suits...

02:37.706 --> 02:39.607
Thank you.

02:39.609 --> 02:41.575
Did I invest in this idea
to make money?

02:41.577 --> 02:42.843
Don't answer that, Vasili,

02:42.845 --> 02:44.278
I will kick you in the throat.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.279
Right in the throat.

02:45.281 --> 02:47.882
Get this one right
or polish your resume.

02:48.951 --> 02:52.453
Ai-yi-yi-yi...

02:54.557 --> 02:55.756
My apologies.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.758
Totally unseemly.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.394
Feodor Glazov, CEO, DCC.

03:00.396 --> 03:02.796
Look, please accept these comps

03:02.798 --> 03:07.233

in Atlantic City.

03:07.235 --> 03:09.702
You too, my skinny supermodel.

03:09.704 --> 03:11.838
You have a man in your--
life?

03:11.840 --> 03:13.974
He like fun?
He has socks?

03:13.976 --> 03:15.208
This will blow them off.

03:15.210 --> 03:16.843
DCC?

03:16.845 --> 03:18.378
Death Cage Competition.

03:19.447 --> 03:20.280
Ah, of course.

03:20.282 --> 03:22.749
Thank you, Mr. Glazov--

03:22.751 --> 03:23.951
please, call me Frank.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.285
You've never
heard of DCC?

03:25.287 --> 03:26.854
Just a matter of time.

03:26.856 --> 03:28.489
Fastest growing sport
in the world.

03:28.491 --> 03:30.525
Faster than
online poker?

03:30.527 --> 03:32.527
Poker is dead.

03:32.529 --> 03:34.462
This is future.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.564
Vasili,
give me good news.

03:36.566 --> 03:37.899
Yes, bathing suit.

03:37.901 --> 03:39.501
They cover the part
the sun doesn't shine.

03:39.503 --> 03:41.569
Uh, no, thanks.

03:41.571 --> 03:43.638
That "Cage match" crap
is a sign of the apocalypse.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.574
Couldn't agree more.

03:45.576 --> 03:47.609
Um, are you interested?

03:47.611 --> 03:49.911
Actually, I was
going to give you mine.

03:49.913 --> 03:51.313
The only men I know

03:51.315 --> 03:53.015
are the ones who buy tickets
to Comicon in San Diego

03:53.017 --> 03:53.982

03:53.984 --> 03:55.851

04:00.557 --> 04:02.524
Oh, you know,
the dependable weather.

04:02.526 --> 04:03.358
You?

04:03.360 --> 04:04.792
Work.

04:04.794 --> 04:06.894
I've been on Madagascar
for the past three months

04:06.896 --> 04:09.364
studying Lemur migration.

04:09.366 --> 04:11.799
Their population patterns,
their diet changes.

04:11.801 --> 04:13.934
Lemurs, wonderful animals.

04:13.936 --> 04:15.502
Very versatile. Um...

04:15.504 --> 04:18.605
Scent glands in their
paws, if I'm right.

04:18.607 --> 04:20.974
Okay, I'm definitely getting
a scientist vibe from you.

04:20.976 --> 04:22.675
Are you here
on research too?

04:22.677 --> 04:23.977
I wish.
No, I'm meeting someone.

04:23.979 --> 04:25.678
Well, that's very mysterious.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.513

Everyone stays

about a window?

Yeah, that opens,

to an alley, but,
I mean, who cares?

05:37.750 --> 05:39.783
I love you, the pay raise

07:20.485 --> 07:24.820
So, this here's

and that's our part.

07:34.864 --> 07:40.701
Your job is to give us
your account transit numbers.

07:40.703 --> 07:42.971
You give us
the right numbers,

07:42.973 --> 07:44.839
we transfer the funds,

07:44.841 --> 07:47.608
you all keep breathing.

07:47.610 --> 07:49.610

getting forgetful,

07:54.750 --> 07:56.082
our transit numbers?

07:56.084 --> 07:57.184
I mean, I use
an ATM half the time.

07:57.186 --> 08:00.120
Yes, I phone my cousin
in Kiev for money stuff.

08:00.122 --> 08:02.055
And guess what,
bags for douching,

08:02.057 --> 08:02.989

08:06.160 --> 08:08.127
I mean, who remembers
their transfer number?

08:08.129 --> 08:10.195
I make $50,000 a year,

08:10.197 --> 08:11.864
before taxes,

08:11.866 --> 08:12.932
and I'm Canadian.
Get the picture?

08:22.243 --> 08:23.710
The only reason

08:23.712 --> 08:25.946
you are on
this hole of an island

08:25.948 --> 08:27.815
during rainy season

08:27.817 --> 08:29.983
is because of business...

08:29.985 --> 08:34.187
Business that you would like
to keep under the radar.

08:34.188 --> 08:38.726
Means you have access
to lots of money,

08:38.727 --> 08:41.695
money which is now mine.

08:45.099 --> 08:46.866

08:46.868 --> 08:48.568

190k in there.

09:01.950 --> 09:05.218
Or should I say, "had."

09:09.690 --> 09:11.225
Give me my phone,
I'll make a call.

09:14.562 --> 09:16.730

sweet cheeks?

09:16.732 --> 09:19.967

09:19.969 --> 09:22.002

09:22.004 --> 09:23.604

09:23.606 --> 09:25.906

unfortunate for you.

09:25.908 --> 09:27.974
She's a research scientist.

09:27.976 --> 09:30.243

steal her pension plan?

09:30.245 --> 09:33.213

09:39.587 --> 09:43.022
Tyler? Am I satisfied?

09:43.024 --> 09:44.957
Um... kinda?

09:44.959 --> 09:46.425
Do the numbers
check out or not?

09:46.427 --> 09:49.728
Yeah, they check out,
but across three accounts,

09:49.730 --> 09:51.330
she's got $209.

09:52.899 --> 09:54.200
She's broke, boss.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.703
You know, women and money.

09:59.174 --> 10:01.742
Hot <i>and</i> broke,

10:01.744 --> 10:04.045
just the way I like them.

10:04.047 --> 10:05.913
We could make an arrangement,
you and me.

10:11.021 --> 10:12.854
Stay down,
or you're all dead!

10:12.856 --> 10:15.123
Tyler! Hold your fire!

10:17.794 --> 10:18.627
There. Now.

10:28.406 --> 10:30.273
You're abnormals.

10:31.643 --> 10:34.078
Better believe it.

10:41.514 --> 10:43.082
Quite the powers your team has.

10:43.084 --> 10:45.317
They come in handy.

10:45.319 --> 10:47.519
At least the government
thought so,

10:47.521 --> 10:49.320
until about two months ago.

10:49.322 --> 10:51.056
You're ex-military.

10:51.058 --> 10:53.057
Black ops.

10:53.059 --> 10:55.293
Let me guess, CIA or NSA?

10:55.295 --> 10:57.194
Wherever, whenever.

10:57.196 --> 11:00.397
With powers like that,
how could you lose in Iraq?

11:00.399 --> 11:01.798
Because they'd be
totally unstable

11:01.800 --> 11:03.266
as soldiers.

11:03.268 --> 11:05.334
She sounds like
my psych officer.

11:05.336 --> 11:08.103
So the army found you
and trained you until...

11:08.105 --> 11:11.407
Until a couple of
uptight suits in D.C.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.975
decided that our services
were no longer needed.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.110
Couldn't just
let you go, though,

11:15.112 --> 11:16.845
could they?

11:16.847 --> 11:18.380
Not knowing
what you're capable of.

11:18.382 --> 11:20.315
They tried to kill you.

11:20.317 --> 11:22.251
Being "decommissioned"

11:22.253 --> 11:26.155
wasn't exactly
an attractive option.

11:26.157 --> 11:27.323
What, and now

11:27.325 --> 11:28.524
you rip people off
for a living?

11:28.526 --> 11:29.959
Why don't you come
and work for me?

11:29.961 --> 11:31.828
We could make
a lot of money.

11:33.197 --> 11:35.099
Or not.

11:36.468 --> 11:38.036
All these people here
are pretty freaked out

11:38.038 --> 11:39.304
about our...

11:39.306 --> 11:41.239
talents,

11:41.241 --> 11:43.008
except for you.

11:43.010 --> 11:45.511
I don't impress easily.

11:45.513 --> 11:47.980
I don't like
women with secrets.

11:47.982 --> 11:49.448
You'll hate me.

11:53.386 --> 11:56.522
Chesky,
one of these folks

11:56.524 --> 11:58.992
has a plane
hidden somewhere.

11:58.994 --> 12:00.426
Find it, please.

12:03.463 --> 12:06.465
You have the look
of a woman with options.

12:10.837 --> 12:13.372
This can't really be
your plan,

12:13.374 --> 12:16.542
land here,

12:16.544 --> 12:17.610
steal money
from random travelers.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.145
You're after Feliz.

12:19.147 --> 12:20.847
Who's Feliz?

12:20.849 --> 12:22.216
Oh, we can stop pretending.

12:22.218 --> 12:24.185
You all know
we're here to meet him.

12:24.187 --> 12:25.419
It was obvious

12:25.421 --> 12:26.621
as soon as they
started asking

12:26.623 --> 12:27.888
for our banking
information.

12:27.890 --> 12:29.223
Why else

12:29.225 --> 12:30.190
would anyone be on this
crap hole of an island?

12:30.192 --> 12:31.358
Lemurs.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.161
I've been studying Lemurs.

12:34.163 --> 12:36.296
I swear I don't know
who this Feliz person is.

12:36.298 --> 12:41.400
Feliz is a man
with access to a lot of money,

12:41.402 --> 12:43.469
and when he lands,

12:43.471 --> 12:45.070
he's going to turn
it all over to us.

12:45.072 --> 12:46.471
I imagine

12:46.473 --> 12:48.173
some of the cash
that Feliz controls

12:48.175 --> 12:49.541
is yours, right?

12:49.543 --> 12:52.277
Aw, she looks mad now.

12:52.279 --> 12:55.046
Tyler, radar.

12:55.048 --> 12:56.281
Setting it up, boss.

12:59.885 --> 13:00.885
On my cue,

13:00.887 --> 13:02.654
Frank, you get
Brad, clear?

13:02.656 --> 13:03.655
Clear.

13:03.657 --> 13:04.789
What are you gonna do?

13:04.791 --> 13:07.225
Just stay close to me,
all right?

13:25.110 --> 13:26.311
Zimmerman.

13:28.081 --> 13:31.148
Yeah, when?

13:31.150 --> 13:32.616
Agent Corrigan.

13:32.618 --> 13:34.351
How the hell
did that happen?

13:34.353 --> 13:36.620
Yes, I understand.

13:36.622 --> 13:37.887
I'll be there
in 15 minutes.

13:37.889 --> 13:39.655
No, no, no,
Henry and I can handle it.

13:39.657 --> 13:41.057
Just send over the data,
we'll take care of it.

13:41.059 --> 13:42.558
Yes, sir, I'm on my way.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.492
Okay.

13:43.494 --> 13:44.693
Uh, work.

13:44.695 --> 13:46.394
Yeah, me too.

13:46.396 --> 13:49.130
Departmental
budget crisis.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.398
There's a monster
on the loose.

13:51.668 --> 13:54.969
This was really nice, Will.
Thank you.

13:54.971 --> 13:56.470
Yeah, we should make this

13:56.472 --> 13:57.972
a little ritual, darling,
you know?

13:57.974 --> 13:59.273
A weekly interlude.

13:59.275 --> 14:01.442
I would love that,
minus the accent.

14:01.444 --> 14:03.444
Sorry, it's non-negotiable.

14:05.581 --> 14:06.547
I'll call you.

14:06.549 --> 14:07.448
Will you?

14:10.053 --> 14:11.519
Bye.

14:31.507 --> 14:33.475
That's what
I'm talking about.

14:33.477 --> 14:36.112
We just got upgraded.

14:48.258 --> 14:49.692
Miley Cyrus!

14:49.694 --> 14:51.693
That's <i> gotta</i> be
against FAA regs!

14:51.695 --> 14:53.229
What the hell are we gonna do?

14:53.231 --> 14:55.564
Get the temp kit, Jonesy.

14:55.566 --> 14:57.433
We're jacking this plane.

15:00.771 --> 15:02.705
890 kilometers out.

15:02.707 --> 15:04.440
ETA?

15:04.442 --> 15:06.609
With speed and head wind,
an hour, maybe less.

15:09.312 --> 15:10.746
Mr. Sylvester...
Brad?

15:13.518 --> 15:16.019
My head...

15:16.021 --> 15:17.287
My suit...

15:17.289 --> 15:18.554
Quiet. Can you walk?

15:19.590 --> 15:20.590
Can you be nicer?

15:20.592 --> 15:21.691
Hands where I can see 'em.

15:30.668 --> 15:33.302
Put the gun down!

15:33.304 --> 15:34.337
I'm assuming
someone with X-ray vision

15:34.339 --> 15:36.038
is worth more
than a few hostages.

15:38.776 --> 15:40.777
You want Mr. Feliz,
good luck with that,

15:40.779 --> 15:42.645
but these people and I
are leaving.

15:42.647 --> 15:44.047
Oh, I knew you had a ride.

15:44.049 --> 15:45.515
Inside. Move.

15:55.760 --> 15:58.094
Hit it!

16:02.100 --> 16:03.134
Let's go.

16:07.305 --> 16:08.239
Quickly.

16:27.260 --> 16:29.628
Hey, nice moves back there!

16:29.630 --> 16:30.496
When this is over,

16:30.498 --> 16:31.497
I owe you
a case of Cristal.

16:31.499 --> 16:32.465
One thing at a time!

16:39.740 --> 16:42.809
What the hell was that?

16:42.811 --> 16:44.478
Keep working.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.512
Come on.

16:50.284 --> 16:52.819
Damn. I'd only
just bought that.

17:00.496 --> 17:01.463
What the hell
happened?

17:01.465 --> 17:04.433
That can't be good.

17:04.435 --> 17:06.233
I can't hear anything
you guys are saying!

17:06.236 --> 17:07.569
I said "that can't--

17:07.570 --> 17:09.704
don't worry about it.

17:15.344 --> 17:18.378
Recess is over, kids.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.484
You and Kate handled

17:25.487 --> 17:26.420
the last time
one of these escaped,

17:26.422 --> 17:28.221
so give me the 411.

17:28.223 --> 17:29.723
<i>Steno-pel-habilis.</i>

17:29.725 --> 17:32.192
Beijing Sanctuary's been
breeding little Ralphies

17:32.194 --> 17:33.494
like gangbusters.

17:33.496 --> 17:35.463
"Ralphie" being the one
you recaptured a few years ago.

17:35.465 --> 17:36.732
Yeah, Kate named it.

17:36.734 --> 17:37.966
Okay, how come there's
another one loose?

17:37.968 --> 17:40.636
Shipping container mix-up
out of Beijing.

17:40.638 --> 17:42.138
And one of our abnormals
goes missing.

17:42.140 --> 17:44.507
Yup. A full-sized
Steno popped up

17:44.509 --> 17:45.742
in an Ikea warehouse
down by the docks.

17:45.744 --> 17:48.178
Okay, one to ten,

17:48.180 --> 17:49.512
how difficult is it

17:49.514 --> 17:50.847
for one of these
to be captured?

17:50.849 --> 17:52.115
Uh, now that I know
its eating habits

17:52.117 --> 17:53.249
and favorite haunts?

17:53.251 --> 17:54.150
I'd say about a two.

17:54.152 --> 17:55.585
Hmm.

17:55.587 --> 17:56.787
The Jays are playing
a double-header tonight,

17:56.789 --> 17:57.721
and Biggie's making wings.

17:57.723 --> 17:59.422
Again with the chicken.

18:00.491 --> 18:02.158
Again, not complaining.

18:03.761 --> 18:05.695
I'd say Chesky tried to Jack
the Brit's plane,

18:05.697 --> 18:08.731
triggered some kind of
auto destruct.

18:08.733 --> 18:10.466
Pretty slick.

18:10.468 --> 18:11.767
We jammed all
transmissions in the L.Z.

18:11.769 --> 18:12.868
She's cut off from the outside.

18:12.870 --> 18:14.670
That's not good enough.

18:14.672 --> 18:18.442
I want her taken out.

18:18.444 --> 18:20.411
You know, you act like
quite the bad ass,

18:20.413 --> 18:22.880
but her plane just took out
two of your people,

18:22.882 --> 18:24.715
and now she's out there
gettin' her James Bond on.

18:24.717 --> 18:26.317
You know, I would
characterize that

18:26.319 --> 18:29.354
as an epic fail, my man.

18:29.356 --> 18:32.222
I may be bulletproof,

18:32.224 --> 18:33.624
but I don't like getting shot.

18:34.660 --> 18:35.526
You feel me?

18:39.665 --> 18:40.565
So...

18:40.567 --> 18:43.468
This woman knows weapons,

18:43.470 --> 18:44.702
is a trained fighter.

18:44.704 --> 18:46.672
What is she,
British intelligence?

18:46.674 --> 18:50.375
She never told me
what business she's in.

18:53.213 --> 18:56.181
I only met her an hour ago.

18:56.183 --> 18:58.483
What's her name?

19:00.386 --> 19:01.386
I don't think she told us.

19:10.196 --> 19:13.733
Name?

19:15.569 --> 19:18.737
Helen...

19:18.739 --> 19:20.739
Magnus.

19:20.741 --> 19:22.541
Running it.

19:22.543 --> 19:23.609
If she's meeting the banker,

19:23.611 --> 19:25.711
she's gotta be
someone with money.

19:29.349 --> 19:31.383
You know, this woman,

19:31.385 --> 19:32.784
she is more than someone
with just cash...

19:37.924 --> 19:40.225
<i>She's got you all scared.</i>

20:06.887 --> 20:08.455
C.Q. C.Q.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.890
This is Comoros airport

20:09.892 --> 20:11.591
requesting emergency assistance
on all channels--

20:13.095 --> 20:15.262
<i>Sorry about your plane</i> .

20:15.264 --> 20:16.463
Sorry about your men.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.132
My guess is,

20:18.134 --> 20:20.734
<i>they tried to hit it with</i>
<i>an Em pulse to get on board.</i>

20:20.736 --> 20:22.669
Bad idea.
Makes it explode.

20:22.671 --> 20:25.039
Fun as it was,

20:25.041 --> 20:26.774
it doesn't really
change anything.

20:26.776 --> 20:28.743
Feliz will never land here,

20:28.745 --> 20:30.244
mainly because your men murdered

20:30.246 --> 20:32.380
<i>the entire</i>
<i>air traffic control crew.</i>

20:32.382 --> 20:33.415
With the set-up that we have,

20:33.417 --> 20:35.684
he will never
notice the difference.

20:35.686 --> 20:37.687
You just blew up my plane.

20:37.689 --> 20:39.422
You don't think
he'll notice that from the air?

20:39.424 --> 20:42.325
<i>It's Helen, right?</i>

20:42.327 --> 20:44.962
You seem very determined

20:44.964 --> 20:47.599
to ruin my day.

20:47.601 --> 20:50.768
Maybe I should return the favor.

20:50.770 --> 20:51.870
<i>Harm anyone else</i>

20:51.872 --> 20:53.538
and I promise
you will regret it.

20:53.540 --> 20:56.508
<i>Surrender now,</i>
<i>and they might live.</i>

20:56.510 --> 20:57.642
I have a better offer--

20:57.644 --> 20:59.911
let everyone else go,

20:59.913 --> 21:01.814
and I might consider
letting you and your team

21:01.816 --> 21:03.482
leave here alive.

21:03.484 --> 21:05.617
Think it over.

21:07.620 --> 21:10.522
It's not a bad offer.

21:26.041 --> 21:28.476
Mind if I borrow this?

22:01.011 --> 22:02.377
It's pretty fresh.

22:02.379 --> 22:03.913
It's gotta be close.

22:10.688 --> 22:11.954
Hey, just stun it, okay?

22:11.956 --> 22:13.489
And don't make it mad.

22:13.491 --> 22:14.657
You said this
would be easy.

22:14.659 --> 22:16.692
You saw the poop.

22:36.979 --> 22:37.912
Will?

22:37.914 --> 22:39.981
Abby?

22:39.983 --> 22:42.917
What are you doing
down here?

22:42.919 --> 22:45.519
I'm doing my job, Will.

22:46.655 --> 22:47.888
Departmental
budget crisis?

22:47.890 --> 22:49.991
Are you guys
hunting abnormals now?

22:49.993 --> 22:51.425
Since when does the FBI
do that?

22:51.427 --> 22:54.763
Since the almost
monster-invasion last month.

22:54.765 --> 22:56.932
Every intelligence agency
in the world

22:56.934 --> 22:58.167
is creating abnormal
investigation units.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.235
They are?

22:59.237 --> 23:01.771
So this is
your new assignment.

23:01.773 --> 23:04.074
Thank you for telling me
the truth.

23:04.076 --> 23:06.076
My new posting is classified,

23:06.078 --> 23:08.112
and you guys are, you know...

23:08.114 --> 23:09.446
Rogue.

23:09.448 --> 23:11.415
I couldn't
tell you, Will.

23:11.417 --> 23:12.983
This promotion
is important to me,

23:12.985 --> 23:14.684
and you guys
are kind of on the outs,

23:14.686 --> 23:15.585
with everyone.

23:15.587 --> 23:17.020
No offense.

23:17.022 --> 23:18.521
Well, you're honing in
on our turf

23:18.523 --> 23:19.622
you're keeping us
out of the loop,

23:19.624 --> 23:20.756
what's to be offended by?

23:20.758 --> 23:22.257
My department's mission

23:22.259 --> 23:24.493
is to investigate
any suspicious sightings

23:24.495 --> 23:26.761
or reports
pertaining to the unexplained.

23:26.763 --> 23:28.096
Oh, great,
they're after the Steno.

23:28.098 --> 23:28.964
That's awesome.

23:28.966 --> 23:30.232
Well, there are

23:30.234 --> 23:32.134
a lot of scared
Ikea employees out there.

23:32.136 --> 23:33.569
Abby!

23:36.507 --> 23:38.842
Everything
under control in here, Abby?

23:38.844 --> 23:39.910
Who is this guy?

23:39.912 --> 23:42.814
Special Agent Crealy, FBI.

23:42.816 --> 23:43.748
And...

23:43.750 --> 23:46.551
What are you two
supposed to be?

23:46.553 --> 23:49.221
This is Will Zimmerman
and Henry Foss,

23:49.223 --> 23:51.990
friends of mine
from the Sanctuary.

23:51.992 --> 23:55.194
This is my partner, Gavin.

23:55.196 --> 23:57.096
Gavin.

23:58.197 --> 23:59.531
You and buddy here
want to explain

23:59.533 --> 24:01.033
why you're interfering with
a federal investigation?

24:01.035 --> 24:02.535
Dude, we are not
interfering,

24:02.537 --> 24:03.736
you're interfering.

24:03.738 --> 24:05.538
<i>Dude</i> , don't make me
show you my badge.

24:05.540 --> 24:07.573
Let me tell you something--

24:07.575 --> 24:10.175
what does that even mean?

24:10.177 --> 24:11.710
Okay, Abby,
we're on the clock here.

24:11.712 --> 24:13.845
Oh, because of the Jays
double-header tonight?

24:13.847 --> 24:16.181
No, because there are
people in danger.

24:16.183 --> 24:17.749
This is not time

24:17.751 --> 24:20.019
for the junior B
tryouts.

24:20.021 --> 24:22.188
I'm sorry,
who saved your ass last month

24:22.190 --> 24:23.922
when no world leaders
would take your call?

24:23.924 --> 24:25.457
That was different.

24:25.459 --> 24:26.725
We've dealt with this before.
We know what we're doing--

24:26.727 --> 24:27.927
Uh-huh, and we don't?

24:27.929 --> 24:29.661
You're clueless.

24:29.663 --> 24:30.529
Clueless.

24:30.531 --> 24:31.630
Listen, buddy,

24:31.632 --> 24:33.131
I've had about enough
of your tone.

24:33.133 --> 24:35.833
You are speaking to
federal agents here.

24:35.835 --> 24:36.867
If you call me
"buddy" once more,

24:36.869 --> 24:37.902
I'm going to
take your badge,

24:37.904 --> 24:38.802
and I'm going to
shove it up--

24:38.804 --> 24:39.903
That's right,

24:39.905 --> 24:41.605
it's "arrest a dipstick"
day today, isn't it?

24:41.607 --> 24:42.806
Oh, is it?

24:42.808 --> 24:45.974
Okay, okay, boys!
Boys! Boys...

24:45.976 --> 24:47.176
Whatever we were
looking for

24:47.178 --> 24:48.778
is definitely
long gone now,

24:48.780 --> 24:50.212
so why don't we just

24:50.214 --> 24:52.514
dial it back.

24:52.516 --> 24:54.784
We can each go
our separate ways.

24:54.786 --> 24:56.519
That is a good idea, Abby.

24:58.789 --> 24:59.822
I'm gonna let you off

24:59.824 --> 25:01.256
with a little bit of a warning
this time...

25:01.258 --> 25:03.826
<i>Buddy.</i>

25:03.828 --> 25:04.793
This guy.

25:11.100 --> 25:12.734
Okay, I'm gonna make you
eat your--

25:12.736 --> 25:13.935
Dial it back!

25:17.139 --> 25:18.939
Like she was never born.

25:18.941 --> 25:20.307
No alias hits,

25:20.309 --> 25:22.909
no matching profiles
for a Helen Magnus,

25:22.911 --> 25:24.944
if that's her real name.

25:24.946 --> 25:28.014
Real enough for her
to have a bank account.

25:28.016 --> 25:30.817
Someone's covering
her tracks,

25:30.819 --> 25:33.320
wiping the data
from the intel community.

25:33.322 --> 25:35.188
And whoever's
doing it is good.

25:35.190 --> 25:37.958
There's no sign of her.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.093
Maybe she bugged out,

25:39.095 --> 25:40.928
hitched a ride
to the nearest town?

25:41.831 --> 25:44.132
Not likely.

25:44.134 --> 25:47.035
Run backgrounds on the others,

25:47.037 --> 25:51.106
starting with
Mr. Poker guy here,

25:51.108 --> 25:52.273
Brad Sylvester.

25:52.275 --> 25:53.808
Sure, I'll see
if I can find

25:53.810 --> 25:54.676
anything in the
Echelon secure cloud.

26:07.255 --> 26:09.356
Oh, boy...

26:11.327 --> 26:13.794
Well, well...

26:13.796 --> 26:15.296
Looks like someone

26:15.298 --> 26:19.034
wasn't being
entirely truthful...

26:19.036 --> 26:21.670
Mr. CIA Field Agent.

26:23.942 --> 26:28.311
Oh, I worked with your kind
in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen...

26:28.313 --> 26:31.982
Spooks always had
access to slush funds,

26:31.984 --> 26:33.950
operational cash,
hush money?

26:33.952 --> 26:36.653
And seeing as
they tried to kill us,

26:36.655 --> 26:38.889
I think Uncle Sam owes us
some reparations.

26:38.891 --> 26:40.925
Huh?

26:40.927 --> 26:42.994
It makes me wonder
what the other two are hiding.

26:44.830 --> 26:47.264
You got any secrets,
sweetheart?

26:53.106 --> 26:54.105
E-everything's dead!

26:54.107 --> 26:55.974
It's impossible.

26:55.976 --> 26:57.175
I'm on battery power here.

26:57.177 --> 26:58.409
She's hit us with an Em pulse.

26:58.411 --> 27:00.111
Just give me a target.

27:09.521 --> 27:10.387
Bingo.

27:10.389 --> 27:12.924
21 meters, there.

27:35.079 --> 27:36.780
Damn!

28:02.875 --> 28:04.976
Oh, my God.

28:06.445 --> 28:07.979
Take the Professor next.

28:07.981 --> 28:09.147
No, take me next,
take me next.

28:09.149 --> 28:10.114
I-I'll tell you everything.

28:10.116 --> 28:12.082
I'll tell you
everything!

28:12.084 --> 28:13.684
I-I don't know anything.

28:13.686 --> 28:15.385
I don't know anything!

28:15.387 --> 28:17.020
Let go of me!

28:20.524 --> 28:21.625
Filthy <i> bliad.</i>

28:21.627 --> 28:24.628
Listen, listen, okay?

28:24.630 --> 28:26.730
I just a teacher.

28:26.732 --> 28:28.499
I don't have any secrets.

28:28.501 --> 28:31.837
Baby...

28:31.839 --> 28:34.907
Everyone has secrets.

28:34.909 --> 28:37.109
Please... don't hurt me.

28:43.985 --> 28:45.851
You all right?

28:47.520 --> 28:49.187
I thought
she was gonna kill me.

28:49.189 --> 28:51.055
Pain in the ass,
isn't she?

28:51.057 --> 28:51.989
But I've met worse.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.157
There.

28:53.159 --> 28:54.158
Right.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.559
Let's get out of here.

29:05.670 --> 29:07.571
Are you all right?
Let me have a look at you.

29:07.573 --> 29:08.839
I'm fine, I'm fine.

29:08.841 --> 29:10.675
But look at you,
you're a mess.

29:10.677 --> 29:12.009
You're covered
in lacerations.

29:12.011 --> 29:13.478
I'm fine.
I've been through worse.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.946
You keep saying that.

29:14.948 --> 29:15.813
"You've been through worse,
you've seen worse."

29:15.815 --> 29:16.915
You sound like an old woman.

29:16.917 --> 29:18.850
I am an old woman.

29:20.085 --> 29:21.886
What's your deal, anyway?

29:21.888 --> 29:23.888
You're being totally cryptic
about being here,

29:23.890 --> 29:26.491
and you went "Die Hard"
on these guys.

29:26.493 --> 29:28.227
What are you,
a spy, an agent, or something?

29:28.229 --> 29:29.127
A doctor.

29:29.129 --> 29:31.130
Of ass-kicking.

29:32.233 --> 29:33.532
Something like that.

29:33.534 --> 29:35.000
Look, Charlotte,

29:35.002 --> 29:36.636
I'm really sorry
that you got mixed up in this,

29:36.638 --> 29:39.472
and I'm not being glib
when I say this,

29:39.474 --> 29:40.673
but I think we can
solve this situation

29:40.675 --> 29:41.640
if we work together.

29:41.642 --> 29:43.142
Are you up for it?

29:44.211 --> 29:45.844
I'm in.

29:45.846 --> 29:47.613
Great. Come on.

29:50.784 --> 29:51.950
I'm coming, relax!

29:54.989 --> 29:56.221
Hi.

29:56.223 --> 29:57.122
Where is he?

29:57.124 --> 29:58.924
Uh, he's his office,
but he just--

29:58.926 --> 30:00.025
oof.

30:01.227 --> 30:03.161
Clever, Will, very clever.

30:03.163 --> 30:04.329
Hi.

30:04.331 --> 30:05.831
Drop the act.
Just tell me why.

30:05.833 --> 30:07.165
Why what?

30:07.167 --> 30:09.201
We received an anonymous tip

30:09.203 --> 30:10.169
that the <i> Steno</i> ,

30:10.171 --> 30:11.370
as you call it,

30:11.372 --> 30:13.139
was hiding in a warehouse
in the seventh ward.

30:13.141 --> 30:16.176
Instead we found a nest
of hibernating Durango bats.

30:16.178 --> 30:17.544
Gavin is still
in the medical clinic

30:17.546 --> 30:18.845
covered in hives.

30:18.847 --> 30:21.681
Ooh, man, those bites
can be really nasty.

30:21.683 --> 30:23.650
No, what's nasty, will,
is that you did this.

30:23.652 --> 30:24.751
You were the anonymous tipster--

30:25.721 --> 30:26.920
Did you plant
the bats too?

30:26.922 --> 30:27.787
L-listen.

30:27.789 --> 30:28.955
No, please,

30:28.957 --> 30:31.791
will, you need
to come clean on this.

30:34.128 --> 30:36.296
All right, fine, I did it.

30:36.298 --> 30:37.598
But just listen to me, okay?

30:37.600 --> 30:39.265
I had to do something

30:39.267 --> 30:40.300
to throw you
off the scent

30:40.302 --> 30:41.835
for your own safety.

30:41.837 --> 30:44.037
A full-grown Steno
can maim or kill

30:44.039 --> 30:45.005
anything in its way,

30:45.007 --> 30:47.007
and you
and Agent Glee Club,

30:47.009 --> 30:48.175
you're not equipped

30:48.177 --> 30:49.543
to deal with
this kind of thing.

30:49.545 --> 30:52.045
So you made us look like fools?

30:52.047 --> 30:53.980
No--

30:53.982 --> 30:55.014
will, professional jealousy
is one thing--

30:55.016 --> 30:55.882
<i>I'm not--</i>

30:55.884 --> 30:57.249
out and out betrayal?

30:57.251 --> 30:58.550
Abby.

30:58.552 --> 31:00.018
It's business,
it's not personal.

31:01.587 --> 31:03.621
This is my career.

31:03.623 --> 31:06.124
My reputation, Will.

31:06.126 --> 31:07.225
It is personal.

31:14.700 --> 31:15.733
You and I are done.

31:17.035 --> 31:18.602
Wait, Abby--

31:22.674 --> 31:24.875
Dude, um...

31:29.281 --> 31:30.481
We have a location?

31:30.483 --> 31:32.851
Yeah, we tracked it
to the sewers

31:32.853 --> 31:33.886
near the water treatment plant.

31:35.622 --> 31:36.855
All right.

31:36.857 --> 31:38.691
Let's get this done.

31:42.575 --> 31:43.775
If you knocked out
the radar,

31:43.777 --> 31:45.677
shouldn't that stop this
Feliz guy from landing?

31:45.679 --> 31:48.714
They'll find a way
around it, believe me.

31:48.716 --> 31:50.048
If we can retake
the terminal,

31:50.050 --> 31:51.183
we can free everyone

31:51.185 --> 31:53.752
and warn Feliz that
he's flying into a trap.

31:53.754 --> 31:55.521
Here, take this.

31:55.523 --> 31:56.789
I don't mean to be
difficult or anything,

31:56.791 --> 31:58.024
but is there any way
we can do this

31:58.026 --> 32:00.793
without me having to
shoot someone or get shot?

32:00.795 --> 32:02.394
Possibly.

32:04.632 --> 32:06.866
Yes. We are hot again.

32:06.868 --> 32:09.570
<i>Comoros tower, I repeat,</i>
<i>this is Rancho 639er</i>

32:09.572 --> 32:11.505
<i>one-five miles west</i>
<i>for runway one,</i>

32:11.507 --> 32:12.740
<i>how do you hear?</i>

32:12.742 --> 32:14.208
Good timing.

32:14.210 --> 32:17.679
Rancho 639er, this is
Comoros tower, good evening.

32:17.681 --> 32:20.782
Wind is zero niner zero
at one-one,

32:20.784 --> 32:22.617
altimeter is 3002,

32:22.619 --> 32:24.853
and you are cleared to land
at runway one.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.821
<i>Runway one, Comoros</i>
<i>tower, Roger that.</i>

32:26.823 --> 32:27.722
<i>See you in five minutes.</i>

32:27.724 --> 32:29.858
Come on in.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.426
Chumps.

32:41.003 --> 32:43.504
How can those people
have those freaky powers?

32:43.506 --> 32:44.471
They're like...

32:44.473 --> 32:46.006
They're like
super villains.

32:46.008 --> 32:49.542
Every exceptional ability
has a weakness, believe me.

32:49.544 --> 32:51.811
Okay, what about
X-ray guy?

32:51.813 --> 32:55.480
Most likely,
his eyes are sensitive

32:55.482 --> 32:57.149
to our body's
thermal heat signatures,

32:57.151 --> 33:00.419
and the woman
with the sonic scream,

33:00.421 --> 33:01.687
unique vocal chords.

33:01.689 --> 33:03.589
It's all explainable by science.

33:04.792 --> 33:06.559
Okay, but bulletproof man?

33:08.695 --> 33:10.563
Super-resilient epidermis.

33:10.565 --> 33:12.432
Likely a result
of the military's attempt

33:12.434 --> 33:14.100
to weaponize abnormals.

33:14.102 --> 33:16.036
Idiots.

33:16.038 --> 33:17.437
And you know all
of this because--

33:19.842 --> 33:21.174
Another time.

33:21.176 --> 33:22.876
In the meantime,

33:22.878 --> 33:25.979
we need to level
the playing field somewhat.

33:29.517 --> 33:32.886
I'm going to need
to use your shirt.

33:49.737 --> 33:51.570
Oh, crap.

33:57.843 --> 33:58.810
Did they just...

33:58.812 --> 34:00.679
Backdrafts can be
extremely violent.

34:00.681 --> 34:01.847
I should have warned you.

34:01.849 --> 34:03.048
Yeah, that's
got to hurt.

34:03.050 --> 34:04.183
Do you think
this'll work?

34:04.185 --> 34:05.784
It has to.

34:05.786 --> 34:07.819
We have to stop
Feliz's plane at all costs.

34:07.821 --> 34:09.554
Because they got
all your money?

34:09.556 --> 34:11.556
Because if those thieves
get what they want,

34:11.558 --> 34:13.123
they'll kill us all!

34:27.840 --> 34:28.840
Move!

34:41.621 --> 34:44.556
Should still be dozing
somewhere in this sector.

34:44.559 --> 34:46.025
Let's just tranq
and bag the sucker

34:46.027 --> 34:48.594
before there's
any more weirdness.

34:54.303 --> 34:56.038
Whoa...

35:06.918 --> 35:08.050
Whoa! Ah!

35:08.052 --> 35:09.218
Okay, okay, okay...

35:09.220 --> 35:10.186
Okay!

35:10.188 --> 35:11.921
Just relax, rover.

35:11.923 --> 35:13.722
Just relax...

35:13.724 --> 35:15.157
Just calm down, okay?

35:15.159 --> 35:16.258
Just calm down.

35:24.134 --> 35:26.201
Are you guys all right?

35:26.203 --> 35:27.770
I'm fine.

35:27.772 --> 35:29.705
Hey, hey, hey...

35:29.707 --> 35:31.106
Come on, hey.
How many fingers?

35:31.108 --> 35:32.007
How many fingers?

35:32.009 --> 35:33.075
Tuesday.

35:33.077 --> 35:34.009
He's gonna be fine,

35:34.011 --> 35:35.578
but we gotta
get him out of here.

35:35.580 --> 35:38.280
Okay, whatever that was,
it's gone.

35:38.282 --> 35:39.248
What was it?

35:39.250 --> 35:40.782
It was a--

35:40.784 --> 35:42.017
<i>stenopelhabilis,</i>

35:42.019 --> 35:43.618
and not a happy one, at that.

35:43.620 --> 35:45.120
We gotta stop it before
it does any more damage.

35:45.122 --> 35:47.856
Whoa, who put you
in charge there, pally?

35:47.858 --> 35:50.759
Gavin, just
shut up and help.

35:50.761 --> 35:51.861
Come on.

35:58.335 --> 35:59.902
Plane's still
gaining altitude, boss,

35:59.904 --> 36:01.670
banking west.

36:01.672 --> 36:03.071
Looks like
something went sideways.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.640
Perhaps your plan
wasn't so brilliant after all.

36:05.642 --> 36:07.274
Hold on.

36:07.276 --> 36:09.176
It's still banking west,

36:09.178 --> 36:11.245
but altitude steady
at 9,000 feet.

36:11.247 --> 36:13.279
He's not leaving.

36:15.150 --> 36:18.951
Which means...

36:18.953 --> 36:23.021
that there is
something down here

36:23.023 --> 36:25.957
that he wants.

36:25.959 --> 36:28.026
Well done.

36:28.028 --> 36:28.960
Now the others.

36:28.962 --> 36:30.362
If we can create a distraction,

36:30.364 --> 36:32.030
we can draw those men
away from the hostages.

36:32.032 --> 36:33.231
I can't.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.399
You'll be fine,
Charlotte.

36:34.401 --> 36:36.068
I lied to you.

36:36.070 --> 36:37.403
About what?

36:37.405 --> 36:39.939
Remember when I said
I was studying Lemurs?

36:39.941 --> 36:41.007
Yeah.

36:41.009 --> 36:43.276
More like
I'm studying

36:43.278 --> 36:44.811
their reaction

36:44.813 --> 36:46.046
to a specific deadly virus.

36:46.048 --> 36:47.948
Last one
we haven't checked.

36:47.950 --> 36:49.650
Belongs to the
professor chick.

36:55.290 --> 36:57.058
Well, well...

36:57.060 --> 36:58.225
And you're
telling me this now?

36:58.227 --> 37:00.094
I had to know
that I could trust you.

37:01.230 --> 37:03.096
Well, I'm glad
we got that sorted.

37:03.098 --> 37:04.164
Just how deadly is this virus?

37:04.166 --> 37:06.233
If a small sample
gets released,

37:06.235 --> 37:08.035
it'll wipe out
everyone on this island.

37:10.038 --> 37:12.339
And half the coast of Africa.

37:16.939 --> 37:18.373
It's complicated, okay?

37:18.375 --> 37:19.674
So, your plan
was to sell it to Feliz.

37:19.676 --> 37:20.942
How noble.

37:20.944 --> 37:22.344
I wasn't going to sell it.

37:22.346 --> 37:23.645
I was going to give it to him.

37:23.647 --> 37:24.913
The government,
the black market,

37:24.915 --> 37:26.681
nobody should get a hold
of this virus.

37:26.683 --> 37:29.350
Feliz contacted me
and said that he would hide it.

37:29.352 --> 37:30.718
I don't care about the money.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.753
I just don't want it to get
into the wrong hands.

37:33.717 --> 37:35.750
So where is it right now?

37:37.494 --> 37:39.732
M-maybe you want to be
careful with that, my friend.

37:39.733 --> 37:41.199
It looks like bad news.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.100
That's what
I'm counting on.

37:44.299 --> 37:46.233
If Feliz wants it,

37:46.235 --> 37:48.001
someone else
will want it too,

37:48.003 --> 37:51.439
and for better money.

37:51.441 --> 37:52.940
You're insane.

37:53.976 --> 37:55.510
Welcome back.

37:58.781 --> 38:00.281
Thanks to
your girlfriend,

38:00.283 --> 38:03.852
this day hasn't been
an entire waste.

38:03.854 --> 38:05.654
You cannot let that virus
out onto the open market.

38:05.656 --> 38:06.722
Now, if you want to
negotiate a price,

38:06.724 --> 38:08.224
you and I can talk,

38:08.226 --> 38:09.859
but only after you've
let everyone else go.

38:11.862 --> 38:13.861
Tyler? Warm up the plane.

38:13.863 --> 38:15.797
We're buggin' out.

38:15.799 --> 38:17.231
I'd listen to her.

38:17.233 --> 38:20.167
That virus makes ebola
look like the common cold.

38:20.169 --> 38:24.237
Millions could die
if it gets released.

38:24.239 --> 38:27.273
So if I were to
drop this on the island

38:27.275 --> 38:29.075
from my plane,

38:29.077 --> 38:31.077
it would really suck for you.

38:31.079 --> 38:32.012
Oh, my God...

38:32.014 --> 38:33.013
You wouldn't.

38:34.015 --> 38:36.216
I'm selling a new weapon.

38:36.218 --> 38:40.921
I need to test it out,
don't I?

38:40.923 --> 38:42.156
Nasty way to go.

38:44.227 --> 38:45.827
Whoa!

38:47.631 --> 38:48.897
Now!

38:48.899 --> 38:50.633
Come on!

38:51.869 --> 38:53.368
It's jammed!

39:03.047 --> 39:06.014
Got it!

39:09.954 --> 39:11.186
That's incredible.

39:11.188 --> 39:13.021
How did you know it was
going to attack you like that?

39:13.023 --> 39:15.091
Let me show you.

39:20.231 --> 39:21.664
Are those..?

39:21.666 --> 39:23.032
Exactly.

39:23.034 --> 39:24.667
<i>Reese's pieces.</i>

39:24.669 --> 39:26.069
I left some
in the sewers

39:26.071 --> 39:28.037
as bait to lure it in.

39:28.039 --> 39:29.339
You know, like ET.

39:29.341 --> 39:33.076
This is the absolute
worst thing to give a steno.

39:33.078 --> 39:34.945
Its system reacts
to sugar and peanuts

39:34.947 --> 39:36.880
like crack cocaine.

39:36.882 --> 39:38.816
It makes it
violently insane.

39:41.719 --> 39:44.855
I'm gonna go
wait over there, with him.

39:46.091 --> 39:48.192
I know, he's a total--

39:48.194 --> 39:50.994
Moron? Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

39:50.996 --> 39:52.196
Hey, you guys?

39:52.198 --> 39:54.231
Can I give it some gum?

39:54.233 --> 39:57.167
Its breath is really bad.

40:00.405 --> 40:05.209
I see more cooperation
in our future.

40:07.078 --> 40:08.212
Good.

40:21.894 --> 40:23.828
I will
shoot myself first.

40:23.830 --> 40:25.063
Who's with me?

40:25.065 --> 40:27.232
Yeah, it's better than
dying of hemorrhagic fever.

40:27.234 --> 40:28.400
That won't be necessary.

40:28.402 --> 40:29.835
Wait for it...

40:39.446 --> 40:42.381
What the hell happened?

40:42.383 --> 40:43.883
That's not
a virus they stole.

40:43.885 --> 40:45.250
Pure nitroglycerine.

40:45.252 --> 40:46.852
I use it
to stabilize samples.

40:46.854 --> 40:47.886
You take it up

40:47.888 --> 40:50.789
in an unpressurized
plane, and...

40:50.791 --> 40:52.024
Is there a virus?

40:52.026 --> 40:55.394
In here.

40:55.396 --> 40:57.063
Carrying a dormant strain
in your own bloodstream.

40:57.065 --> 40:58.365
It's very risky.

40:58.367 --> 40:59.967
It's better than
a pink suitcase.

40:59.969 --> 41:01.435
You're crazy,
you know that?

41:01.437 --> 41:02.870
Both of you.

41:02.872 --> 41:04.972
Are you kidding?
I love you guys!

41:04.974 --> 41:06.975
Thank you,

41:06.977 --> 41:09.043
but you can lose the accent now,

41:09.045 --> 41:10.111
Mr. Feliz.

41:11.547 --> 41:13.748
You can call me Richard.

41:13.750 --> 41:14.950
I thought the Russian accent
was rather good.

41:14.952 --> 41:16.451
It was, it was more

41:16.453 --> 41:18.420
I suspected there was a reason
that your plane hung around

41:18.422 --> 41:19.754
in spite of the carnage.

41:19.756 --> 41:21.957
It made sense that its owner
was here on the ground.

41:21.959 --> 41:23.458
And the ruse?

41:23.460 --> 41:24.960
Good question, Bradley,

41:24.962 --> 41:27.228
you see, I prefer
to meet potential clients

41:27.230 --> 41:29.431
in a more, um,
informal manner

41:29.433 --> 41:30.798
before
taking them on,

41:30.800 --> 41:32.834
and may I say,
Dr. Magnus,

41:32.836 --> 41:34.002
that thanks to my resources,

41:34.004 --> 41:35.972
your financial future
will be very healthy

41:35.974 --> 41:36.939
for quite some time.

41:36.941 --> 41:38.074
Thank you, Richard.

41:38.076 --> 41:40.243
What a day!
How incredible!

41:40.245 --> 41:41.445
Feel my heart--

41:41.447 --> 41:42.946
it's so exciting.

41:42.948 --> 41:45.349
As soon as my plane lands,
the drinks are definitely on me,

41:45.351 --> 41:47.418
because we have much to discuss.

41:47.420 --> 41:48.386
Mmm!

41:54.894 --> 41:56.961
You sure know how to
show a girl a good time.

41:56.963 --> 41:58.863
I try.

41:58.865 --> 42:01.799
Thank you for...
You know...

42:01.801 --> 42:03.868
Don't mention it.
You were very brave.

42:03.870 --> 42:06.037
Here's Richard's plane.

42:11.010 --> 42:12.044
Are you sure
you can't stay

42:12.046 --> 42:13.378
for a day or two?

42:13.380 --> 42:15.581
Relax, hang out?

42:15.583 --> 42:17.083
See, the thing about me
is I rarely just "hang out."

42:21.822 --> 42:22.922
Dear God....

42:24.258 --> 42:25.291
Bad?

42:26.861 --> 42:28.595
On the contrary, I just...

42:28.597 --> 42:31.831
I haven't been kissed like that
in a very long time.
