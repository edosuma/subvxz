00:19.220 --> 00:20.386
- Morning, Hannah.

00:20.422 --> 00:22.522
     - Why does this place
     always smell so good?

00:22.590 --> 00:25.057
   - We got some new flavors,
   fresh out of the oven.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.192
     What can I get for ya?

00:26.928 --> 00:29.962
  - Uh, they're all so pretty.

00:29.998 --> 00:31.931
    Like mini works of art.

00:32.867 --> 00:36.202
      I think I'm gonna
      need three of each.

00:40.975 --> 00:41.941
       - Ah, good choice.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.945
If you haven't tried the frosted
mango yet there's one left.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.583
    - Never fails, start
    and end of every season.

00:51.820 --> 00:52.752
   - Well, I don't know, it
   just seems like everybody

00:52.787 --> 00:54.720
    works so hard, you know?

00:54.789 --> 00:56.189
      I think we deserve--

00:56.257 --> 00:57.190
        - Frosted mango?

00:58.626 --> 01:00.927
    - Dessert for breakfast.

01:00.995 --> 01:03.996
   And since it's been such a
   good season, it's all you.

01:06.868 --> 01:08.067
            - Mm.
            - Right?

01:08.136 --> 01:09.502
- It's so good.

01:09.537 --> 01:10.970
           - Donuts.

01:11.005 --> 01:11.804
              Yep.

01:13.341 --> 01:14.040
- So what are you
 gonna do this weekend?

01:14.075 --> 01:16.309
    - You mean for my break?

01:16.344 --> 01:18.578
  - It's only four whole days.

01:18.613 --> 01:19.779
  - I'll take what I can get.

01:19.848 --> 01:21.013
    - Good morning, Hannah.

01:21.049 --> 01:22.315
             - Hey.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.249
       - Okay, we've got
       to get rolling.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.317
 We're shooting in two minutes.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.085
     - Okay, you've got it.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.520
   Ugh, I hope they love it.

01:27.555 --> 01:28.521
     - Oh, they always do.

01:29.924 --> 01:30.823
         Almost always.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.093
      Oh, before I forget,
      Wally wants to

01:34.162 --> 01:35.394
     meet with us tomorrow
     morning, 9:00 a.m.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.330
      I know it's cutting
      into your break so--

01:37.398 --> 01:38.331
             - Why?

01:38.399 --> 01:39.098
             Where?

01:39.133 --> 01:39.932
       - At the network.

01:41.703 --> 01:43.769
      Don't worry, I know
      you always think

01:43.805 --> 01:44.804
       it's a bad thing.

01:44.839 --> 01:46.038
- He's the head of the network.

01:46.074 --> 01:47.106
  He only goes into the office

01:47.175 --> 01:48.074
 when he wants to fire people.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.009
    - Trust me, we're fine.

01:50.044 --> 01:51.911
     Okay, our ratings are
     still pretty solid.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.847
      Okay, sliding a
      little, but he said

01:54.883 --> 01:57.850
     he just wants to
     discuss some changes.

01:57.886 --> 01:58.985
           - Changes?

01:59.053 --> 02:01.220
      - Hannah, as you're
      most amazing friend

02:01.256 --> 02:03.523
     and talented producer,
     I'm tellin you,

02:03.591 --> 02:05.925
      you have nothing to
      worry about, okay?

02:05.960 --> 02:09.461
     They love you, so just
     go out there and--

02:09.497 --> 02:11.464
  - Be bold but not too bold.

02:11.499 --> 02:14.267
  - Wally's phrasing, not
  mine, but yeah, pretty much.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.469
        You've got this.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.104
Okay guys, we're rolling.

02:23.478 --> 02:25.478
- Welcome back to Love in Design

02:25.547 --> 02:28.948
  where every season we bring
  outdated living spaces

02:28.983 --> 02:32.151
     kicking and screaming,
     into the 21st century.

02:32.220 --> 02:36.756
 And in this tight urban space,
 less was definitely more.

02:36.791 --> 02:39.625
 We cleared the clutter,
 toned down the color palettes

02:39.694 --> 02:42.395
     and added some simple
     clean lines to give

02:42.463 --> 02:45.498
     this apartment a
     clean, sleek, modern,

02:45.567 --> 02:47.433
        yet rustic feel.

02:47.502 --> 02:50.970
    So, are you ready to
    see how our clients feel

02:51.005 --> 02:52.905
  about their new modern home?

02:52.941 --> 02:53.940
        - It's amazing.

02:54.976 --> 02:56.442
- It's exactly what we expected.

02:59.581 --> 03:00.580
- And cut.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.462
         - Hey, Carol.
         - Hey, Jeff.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.697
        - How you doin'?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.131
       - It's about time
       you get in here.

03:19.167 --> 03:22.368
     - Yeah, you know, I'm
     gonna get the usual.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.604
       - Club sandwich,
       salad on the side.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.572
  - How do you remember this?

03:26.608 --> 03:27.440
          - Just good.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.708
 - Oh, you know what, I'm also

03:28.743 --> 03:30.142
gonna do a small bowl of chili.

03:30.178 --> 03:31.477
      - It's not like you
      to change things up.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.579
      - I know, first day
      at the new job so

03:33.615 --> 03:34.981
I kinda got more of an appetite.

03:35.016 --> 03:36.616
       I'm also hoping to
       revive my morning

03:36.651 --> 03:39.051
     cycle routine again,
     so turn up my protein

03:39.087 --> 03:40.252
       intake, you know?

03:40.288 --> 03:42.088
     - So you gonna tell me
     what brought you home?

03:42.156 --> 03:43.122
             Work?

03:43.157 --> 03:44.123
             Love?

03:44.158 --> 03:45.157
     A little bit of both?

03:46.461 --> 03:47.693
     - Yeah, he's still
     working on that second

03:47.729 --> 03:48.561
          part there.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.829
- Oh come on, I've been in town

03:49.864 --> 03:50.696
       for two weeks and
       you're riding me

03:50.765 --> 03:51.931
  on my relationship already.

03:51.966 --> 03:53.299
     - It's not me, that's
     Ali and the kids.

03:53.368 --> 03:54.533
   - Oh yeah, yeah of course.

03:54.569 --> 03:55.635
          Hey, Carol.

03:55.670 --> 03:56.802
  I'm gonna have what he has.

03:56.838 --> 03:58.571
         - Chili, too?

03:58.606 --> 04:00.606
- No, wait, who's having chili?

04:00.642 --> 04:01.874
       - Mm hmm, oh yeah.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.878
   - So, I was gonna get ya a
   plant for your first day.

04:05.913 --> 04:06.612
          - You were?

04:06.648 --> 04:07.847
      - No, of course not.

04:07.882 --> 04:08.581
            Come on.

04:08.650 --> 04:10.282
     But I did get ya this.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.917
       Left over from the
       sales conference.

04:11.953 --> 04:12.718
           A big hit.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.154
             - Hmm.

04:15.189 --> 04:16.055
             Solid.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.757
  - It's good to have ya back.

04:17.791 --> 04:18.824
    - It's good to be back.

04:20.128 --> 04:21.394
       You know what, I
       think I like this

04:21.428 --> 04:23.329
   better than the water
   gun key chain you got me.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.864
            - Whoa.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.632
  Come on, on a hot day there
  is no better gift, man.

04:26.701 --> 04:27.566
             None.

04:27.602 --> 04:28.868
          - Says who?

04:30.938 --> 04:32.571
      - Ali and the kids.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.581
  - Hi, Wally's ready for you.

04:43.518 --> 04:44.784
        Right this way.
        - Thank you.

04:47.055 --> 04:48.387
    - You know we love you.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.424
     We love the show,
     that's not the issue.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.527
 - Okay, then why are we here?

04:55.530 --> 04:57.396
        - At this point,
        we just think...

04:58.633 --> 05:00.433
       Your makeover show
       needs a makeover.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.068
       To boost ratings.

05:02.103 --> 05:04.136
    - So we're not canceled.

05:04.172 --> 05:05.037
             - No!

05:06.140 --> 05:06.972
     Well not yet, anyway.

05:09.077 --> 05:11.043
    No, the home renovation
    landscape on TV

05:11.112 --> 05:12.445
       is just way too
       crowded right now.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.613
       So we need to find
       a way to stand out

05:14.682 --> 05:15.915
     and grab more viewers.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.650
      And not just in the
      metropolitan areas.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.818
      - Well, we can
      certainly brainstorm

05:18.853 --> 05:19.785
 some ideas, maybe over lunch--

05:19.821 --> 05:21.420
- Oh, it's already been decided.

05:21.456 --> 05:22.988
     We're moving the show
     to your hometown,

05:23.024 --> 05:24.857
       for the first half
       of season five.

05:24.926 --> 05:26.092
       - Who's hometown?

05:26.127 --> 05:26.926
          - Hannah's.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.964
            I know.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.466
      I know, I should've
      run it by you first,

05:33.501 --> 05:34.633
      but it just came up.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.303
    - I'm sorry, have you
    ever been to Lewisburg?

05:37.338 --> 05:41.240
   Little rural town that
   doesn't really do modern.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.042
     - I wouldn't have
     thought of it either,

05:43.077 --> 05:45.478
   if the owner of Lewisburg
   Manor hadn't reached out.

05:46.647 --> 05:50.015
     Apparently um, Margot
     wants to convert her

05:50.051 --> 05:52.318
       family's historic
       manor into a B&B.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.619
      You know it, right?

05:53.654 --> 05:55.287
     - I used to give tours
     there in high school.

05:56.491 --> 05:59.825
    Ahem, are you sure she
    wants a modern makeover?

05:59.894 --> 06:02.094
    - Whatever she wants,
    she wants you to do it.

06:02.163 --> 06:03.562
     A big fan of the show.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.364
       She also wants it
       done in time for

06:05.433 --> 06:08.300
     the 150th anniversary
     in five weeks.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.169
    That's their grand
    opening and our natural

06:10.204 --> 06:11.337
       mid-season break.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.240
 - One makeover in five weeks--

06:14.275 --> 06:16.675
- We usually do one an episode.

06:16.711 --> 06:20.312
      - Trust me, this way
      you can go indepth,

06:20.381 --> 06:21.480
         get personal.

06:21.516 --> 06:24.049
      Let the audience get
      to know you, Margot,

06:24.118 --> 06:25.818
      quaint townspeople.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.052
    Spruce things up a bit.

06:27.088 --> 06:29.488
    - I didn't realize that
    that's the kind of thing

06:29.524 --> 06:30.689
        you were after.

06:30.725 --> 06:32.024
      - Well, we still
      want you to be bold

06:32.093 --> 06:35.194
    but in your hometown, so
    a little more personal.

06:35.229 --> 06:39.498
       But not too um...

06:39.567 --> 06:40.800
          - Personal?

06:40.835 --> 06:42.168
          - Personal.

06:42.203 --> 06:43.002
           - Exactly.

06:43.805 --> 06:45.805
         Any questions?

06:45.840 --> 06:50.176
  - Uh, just when do we leave?

06:53.414 --> 06:54.747
      - Hello there again.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.348
  Was that your boss calling?

06:56.384 --> 06:58.050
  - No, it was the
  coordinator just confirming

06:58.119 --> 06:59.285
         flight times.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.120
- So you don't
  get any time off?

07:01.155 --> 07:03.255
     - It was just a little
     break anyway, but...

07:05.860 --> 07:06.992
      You know, it's fine.

07:07.061 --> 07:08.961
      I am just glad
      we're not canceled.

07:09.030 --> 07:10.896
     - Well if you ask me,
     they're just lucky

07:10.965 --> 07:12.331
         to have you.
         - Thanks mom.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.733
       But there are like
       a million people

07:14.769 --> 07:15.868
  who would kill for this job.

07:15.903 --> 07:16.902
      I guess I just need
      to try to give them

07:16.938 --> 07:18.871
    more of what they want.

07:18.940 --> 07:20.573
- Well I'm sure you are

07:20.608 --> 07:22.107
 acing it, like you always do.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.909
       - I'm definitely
       not acing it, Mom,

07:23.978 --> 07:25.611
      or the show wouldn't
      need a makeover.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.812
   I'm excited to come home.

07:26.848 --> 07:28.614
     You know, the project
     seems pretty easy

07:28.683 --> 07:30.549
     in the grand scheme of
     things and, it'll be

07:30.585 --> 07:32.651
    like a working vacation.

07:32.687 --> 07:33.953
         Only at home.

07:33.988 --> 07:35.354
       With you and dad.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.256
- Well your
  room's all ready.

07:37.325 --> 07:39.191
- Well the
  show will put me up

07:39.260 --> 07:40.392
  so you don't have to worry.

07:40.428 --> 07:43.395
     - I know I don't, but,
     a hotel is not home.

07:43.431 --> 07:45.030
             - Mom.

07:45.066 --> 07:47.266
       - And you are long
       overdue a visit.

07:49.070 --> 07:50.970
      - Okay, as long as
      you don't bring out

07:51.005 --> 07:52.338
     my unicorn comforter.

07:55.843 --> 07:56.976
            Promise?

07:57.011 --> 07:59.545
 - Okay, I can go change that.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.715
Oh, Hannah, before you get here,

08:02.750 --> 08:04.316
       I thought I should
       mention that--

08:06.687 --> 08:08.120
     - Uh, shoot, gotta go.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.088
         See you soon.

08:13.694 --> 08:14.460
            - Well?

08:15.696 --> 08:18.130
      - I'll just tell her
      when she gets here.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.813
       - The Preservation
       Committee wants me

08:34.881 --> 08:36.615
   to oversee the renovation?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.650
  - I prefer to say, consult.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.751
      I know it's a little
      different than

08:39.787 --> 08:41.754
the work you were expecting but,

08:41.789 --> 08:45.124
the committee can be a
 little, particular.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.460
   - Well, that's why people
   love this town, right?

08:48.496 --> 08:50.396
     - And they know you of
     all people get that.

08:50.431 --> 08:52.665
Three generations of family here

08:52.700 --> 08:54.333
 and a real drive to come back.

08:54.402 --> 08:55.734
They just want you to make sure

08:55.770 --> 08:57.236
  that any changes are in
  line with the town's history

08:57.271 --> 08:58.737
     and aesthetics,
     especially since it's

08:58.806 --> 09:00.506
       one of the oldest
       buildings here.

09:00.574 --> 09:03.175
  - Well, look, I'm flattered.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.011
    But you don't need the
    city architect for this.

09:06.047 --> 09:07.646
      The rules won't let
      them do anything

09:07.682 --> 09:09.081
  structural to the exterior.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.449
     - It's a fast project.

09:10.518 --> 09:12.518
    The committee just wants
    someone on the ground.

09:14.655 --> 09:19.024
      - Why does this
      seem like policing?

09:19.060 --> 09:21.160
      - It's just a quick
      five week project

09:21.228 --> 09:22.728
     which is also why they
     want someone who's

09:22.763 --> 09:24.530
  familiar with the property.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.632
     After this we can move
     onto something more...

09:26.667 --> 09:27.599
         Up your alley.

09:29.270 --> 09:31.670
       - Okay, all right.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.740
  Who's doing the renovation?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.409
  - Do you watch a lot of TV?

09:39.480 --> 09:40.279
           - Oh boy.

09:47.288 --> 09:48.954
        - There she is.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.725
  - Oh my gosh, you guys
  didn't have to do all this.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.493
     - I couldn't help it,
     missed you so much.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.097
           - Oh, hi.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.365
        Oh my goodness.

09:59.400 --> 10:02.301
     - Hey, we're hugging.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.404
  - We're so happy to see you.

10:05.473 --> 10:06.638
    - You guys are amazing.

10:09.210 --> 10:10.609
- Yep, we're heading there now.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.411
     Just a quick look to
     see what we're in for

10:12.480 --> 10:14.446
        and connect with
        the owner before

10:14.482 --> 10:15.948
       the whole circus
       rolls in tomorrow.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.150
   We don't want to overwhelm
   Margot on day one.

10:20.054 --> 10:22.121
    Okay, I'll let her know.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.491
       - Everything okay?

10:25.526 --> 10:27.026
       - Absolutely, they
       just want us to

10:27.094 --> 10:28.394
consult with the city architect.

10:28.429 --> 10:29.528
          - Who does?

10:29.563 --> 10:30.629
    - The local Preservation
    Committee since

10:30.664 --> 10:31.930
   it's a historic building.

10:33.134 --> 10:34.967
       Sounds like it's
       just a formality.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.869
     - People don't always
     love change here.

10:36.904 --> 10:39.671
     - I think it's gonna
     be a great little B&B.

10:39.707 --> 10:40.806
         - Thanks, mom.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.775
     - Oh and Julie, I
     hope Hannah mentioned

10:42.810 --> 10:44.410
      that you were more
      than welcome to stay

10:44.445 --> 10:45.577
       at our place, too.

10:45.646 --> 10:48.747
     - Oh, that's so
     sweet of you, but I--

10:48.783 --> 10:51.583
     - Julie kind of loves
     staying at hotels.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.619
- I have to
  admit, it's a perk

10:53.654 --> 10:55.454
   but I do love that
   Hannah's staying with you.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.022
      - Oh good, because
      she hasn't been home

10:57.058 --> 10:58.824
    in close to three years.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.626
       - Only because you
       guys are so great

11:00.661 --> 11:01.927
        about visiting.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.128
            And I--

11:03.197 --> 11:04.129
      - And you're working
      way too hard.

11:04.198 --> 11:05.097
- Mm-hmm.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.031
      - I never said that.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.877
         - Are we here?

11:18.913 --> 11:19.845
       - We'll just go
       run some errands.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.779
     We'll go to the store.

11:20.815 --> 11:22.114
   - Pick you up in an hour?

11:22.149 --> 11:23.282
      - Oh, you guys don't
      have to come back.

11:23.317 --> 11:24.883
     We'll just get a
     ride from production.

11:26.654 --> 11:27.686
      See you in an hour.

11:30.558 --> 11:31.824
         - See ya, hon.

11:31.859 --> 11:32.658
        - See ya later.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.465
   - Ready to change history?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.237
    - It's been interesting,
    people's reaction.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.107
      - Well, a new B&B is
      great for tourism.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.042
  - Yes, it is, but I get it.

11:50.077 --> 11:53.078
   It wasn't my plan either,
   to change all this.

11:53.147 --> 11:56.815
  But after my husband
  passed, I took a year away,

11:56.884 --> 11:59.718
 traveled and realized I didn't

11:59.753 --> 12:01.687
want to stay stuck in the past.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.389
      He wouldn't have
      wanted that for me.

12:04.425 --> 12:06.258
         Or this place.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.595
     So I just decided to
     do something different

12:09.630 --> 12:11.063
          more social.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.397
- Yeah.

12:12.433 --> 12:14.266
       - So this used to
       be open for tours.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.301
    - Actually, Hannah was
    one of our best guides.

12:16.337 --> 12:19.071
      Didn't always
      stick to the rules.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.038
             - You?

12:21.275 --> 12:23.609
     - Well I can go rogue,
     I mean, you know.

12:23.644 --> 12:26.078
     - Snuck a whole tour
     group into the lounge.

12:26.147 --> 12:27.446
   Even though it was closed.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.114
- I'm sorry, it had to be seen.

12:29.150 --> 12:30.382
     The way the light
     was coming in through

12:30.417 --> 12:32.518
      the stained glass
      window was stunning.

12:32.553 --> 12:36.088
    - See, that passion is
    why everyone loved her.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.223
- Now, that doesn't surprise me.

12:38.259 --> 12:40.192
    - And why I thought
    your modern sensibility

12:40.227 --> 12:42.494
 might be exactly what we need.

12:42.563 --> 12:45.864
     Someone who knows this
     place but could still

12:45.900 --> 12:46.632
        see beyond that.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.167
          - Thank you.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.501
      - I just can't
      believe you'll both

12:49.570 --> 12:50.435
     be working here again.

12:50.471 --> 12:52.037
     After all these years.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.238
       - I'm sorry, both?

12:53.307 --> 12:54.373
       - Oh, there he is.

13:04.552 --> 13:05.350
             Jeff.

13:06.487 --> 13:07.886
   - Hey, Margot, how are ya?

13:09.089 --> 13:11.123
    - It looks like you
    moved home just in time.

13:12.126 --> 13:13.492
        - Hi, I'm Jeff.

13:13.527 --> 13:14.860
          - Hi, Julie.

13:14.929 --> 13:16.295
    Nice to meet you.
    - Nice to meet you, too.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.898
      So I'm guessing I'm
      not the architect

13:19.934 --> 13:20.966
    that you were expecting.

13:22.503 --> 13:24.203
  - You could say that again.

13:24.238 --> 13:26.572
  - Oh, oh, you're that Jeff.

13:38.018 --> 13:41.220
      - Okay, I know it's
      a small town but...

13:42.456 --> 13:43.222
         Wait a minute.

13:44.692 --> 13:46.992
     Why didn't you guys
     tell me he moved back?

13:47.027 --> 13:48.827
       You must've known.

13:48.862 --> 13:49.995
         - I tried to.

13:50.064 --> 13:51.563
            - When?

13:51.599 --> 13:52.831
        - This morning.

13:52.866 --> 13:53.999
         - This morn...

13:54.034 --> 13:55.500
You just found out this morning?

13:55.536 --> 13:56.902
      - Well okay, I
      found out last week,

13:56.937 --> 13:58.770
      not that you would
      be working together.

13:58.839 --> 13:59.871
      I did not know that.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.340
          It's just...

14:01.375 --> 14:02.908
   You've been a little
   worried about work lately

14:02.943 --> 14:04.810
       and I didn't want
       to add to that.

14:04.878 --> 14:05.711
            - What?

14:05.746 --> 14:08.513
No, it wouldn't add to anything.

14:08.549 --> 14:10.082
     No, I'm happy for him.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.583
   He's been wanting to move
   back here for awhile.

14:11.619 --> 14:13.518
   - I know it's
   complicated with you two.

14:13.554 --> 14:15.621
   You dated for a long time.

14:15.656 --> 14:17.656
    - That is not the issue.

14:17.725 --> 14:19.124
            No, no.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.027
     You know, I mean, he's
     like my old sweater.

14:22.096 --> 14:23.428
      We were comfortable,
      it's just that,

14:23.464 --> 14:26.198
    you know, even though we
    haven't seen each other

14:26.233 --> 14:28.133
    in three years, it would
    be easy to fall back

14:28.168 --> 14:31.903
    into just, I just don't
    want any distractions.

14:31.939 --> 14:32.704
     You know what I mean?

14:33.674 --> 14:35.307
   I, this is too important.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.976
     And we have nothing in
     common, design wise.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.778
     Do you remember his
     apartment in college?

14:39.847 --> 14:41.246
      - The old converted
      bank building.

14:41.282 --> 14:43.248
       - It was crammed
       and it was dusty.

14:43.284 --> 14:44.616
          - And dark.

14:44.652 --> 14:47.219
   - But he loved it because
   he could feel the history.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.088
       And now I have to
       consult with that.

14:50.124 --> 14:52.557
    - I am sure you won't
    even notice he's there.

14:53.494 --> 14:54.660
- It's Jeff we're talking about.

15:03.671 --> 15:04.436
        - You know what?

15:04.471 --> 15:05.837
           It's fine.

15:05.873 --> 15:06.772
            - Fine?

15:06.840 --> 15:08.240
- I'm just going to stay focused

15:08.309 --> 15:11.076
     and I'm going to make
     it a great season

15:11.111 --> 15:13.045
and a great time with you guys.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.646
    - Well, we are excited.

15:14.682 --> 15:15.947
- You can even do some cycling.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.249
         You love that.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.617
        - Yeah, cheers.

      - And a good
      breakfast will start

16:49.777 --> 16:51.143
      your day off right.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.744
      - Thanks, mom, but
      I think I'm all set.

16:52.780 --> 16:55.180
   Plus I have to get donuts
   before I go in to work.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.354
    Breakfast sounds great.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.455
            - Good.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.390
 Your father's already outside.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.724
 - Okay, I'll get one of these.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.231
         Good morning.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.334
      I love that you guys
      still have breakfast

17:16.369 --> 17:17.803

17:17.838 --> 17:18.737
     - Only in the summer.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.338
   Winter gets a little cold.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.010
    - It's so nice out here.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.244
      Why don't you let me
      fix it up a little?

17:27.281 --> 17:29.214
     - What's there to fix?

17:29.249 --> 17:31.116
- Come on, you know I'd love to.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.084
   Renovation is fun for me.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.520
     - I think you've got
     enough on your plate.

17:35.556 --> 17:37.522
   - Is that a breakfast pun?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.426
            - Okay.

17:43.997 --> 17:44.796
             Mine.

17:48.402 --> 17:50.635
       - Wait, why is
       Wally coming here?

17:51.472 --> 17:52.504
             Today?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.173
     He never comes to set.

17:55.209 --> 17:57.609
    - Actually he won't be
    here until later today,

17:57.644 --> 17:59.211
      but he just said he
      wants to make sure

17:59.246 --> 18:01.079
   we're not missing
   anything to set us apart.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.547
      - Missing anything?

18:02.583 --> 18:04.416
    - Honestly, I think he
    just wants to make sure

18:04.451 --> 18:07.419
     he didn't send us to
     the middle of nowhere.

18:07.454 --> 18:11.656
     - Well, do you think
     Wally likes sprinkles?

18:11.692 --> 18:15.527
     They have cinnamon
     or there's chocolate.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.596
      You know what, I'm
      not going to guess.

18:17.631 --> 18:20.732
       Hi, I'll take five
       of each, please.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.536
        - Are you buying
        the whole store?

18:24.605 --> 18:26.438
       - We're gonna have
       a lot of donuts.

18:48.362 --> 18:50.529
Welcome back to Love in Design.

18:50.564 --> 18:51.329
           Follow me.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.200
   We might not be able to
   change the exterior walls

18:55.235 --> 18:59.070
      but, we can make a
      big impact in here.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.540
          Here ya go.

19:01.575 --> 19:02.507
       This is your mark.

19:03.777 --> 19:05.343
         Are you ready?

19:05.412 --> 19:06.411
            - Ready.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.512
    - All right, here we go.

19:07.548 --> 19:09.047
      Three, two, one, go!

19:11.184 --> 19:12.817
Yeah.

19:13.921 --> 19:15.854
    Whew, and we have begun.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.693
I'm fine with all the separation

19:21.728 --> 19:23.328
upstairs where the bedrooms are,

19:23.363 --> 19:25.564
     but down here we're
     gonna open things up,

19:25.599 --> 19:27.198
        maximize space.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.366
            - Okay.

19:28.402 --> 19:32.504
    - So, what do you think
    about transforming

19:32.573 --> 19:36.675
   the garage, creating a
   larger lower lounge area?

19:36.710 --> 19:39.177
     We'd get a lot more
     room without changing

19:39.246 --> 19:40.545
         the footprint.
         - Hmm.

19:40.581 --> 19:42.247
       - So guests could
       lounge down below

19:42.282 --> 19:44.516
     and play boardgames
     in the den and create

19:44.551 --> 19:46.952
       like a two-tiered
       lounge for anyone

19:46.987 --> 19:48.453
      to relax and mingle.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.055
       - I never would've
       thought of that.

19:50.090 --> 19:52.424
  - And then also down there,
  if we could also just...

19:55.095 --> 19:58.430
   Um, if we could just knock
   down the east facing wall

19:58.465 --> 20:01.099
   we can also create an area
   for guests to check in

20:01.134 --> 20:03.335
    and get a welcome
    glass of wine and go to

20:03.370 --> 20:04.302
        the new lounge.

20:04.338 --> 20:05.203
           - Exactly.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.373
       - Can you excuse
       me for just a sec?

20:08.408 --> 20:09.808
            - Sure.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.280
            - Good.
            - Hi.

20:15.349 --> 20:16.548
       - How's it goin'?

20:16.583 --> 20:17.882
            - Good.
            - Good?

20:17.951 --> 20:21.119
       - Great, I have
       a quick question.

20:21.188 --> 20:23.421
Are you gonna be here every day?

20:23.490 --> 20:24.723
Cause I thought with consulting

20:24.791 --> 20:26.257
 that you would only be here if

20:26.293 --> 20:27.525
     we needed to consult.

20:27.561 --> 20:28.827
        - Normally, yes.
        - Okay, good.

20:28.862 --> 20:30.128
    - But this isn't normal.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.163
      Normally, you know,
      I'd be dealing with

20:32.199 --> 20:36.234
   city design, improvements
   instead of policing.

20:36.269 --> 20:39.337
    - Oh, is that what
    you're doing, policing?

20:39.406 --> 20:41.406
- This wasn't my idea to be here

20:41.441 --> 20:43.008
   in the first place, okay?

20:43.043 --> 20:45.977
   Just want to make sure
   you don't change too much.

20:46.013 --> 20:50.382
    - Is this test footage?
    - Yeah, not exactly.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.752
   - Just don't make
   everything shiny and new.

20:53.787 --> 20:55.687
   - Because you hate change?

20:55.722 --> 20:57.689
 - Well, change, I love change.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.290
       I embrace change.

20:59.326 --> 21:00.825
    - So you don't still
    drive that old Mustang?

21:00.894 --> 21:02.260
           - No, no.
           - Really?

21:02.295 --> 21:03.495
       - Not really, no.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.530
Sometimes, okay, when I'm trying

21:05.599 --> 21:07.065
      to impress somebody.

21:08.235 --> 21:10.568
      Look, I just don't
      think shiny and new

21:10.637 --> 21:12.704
       instantly makes
       everything better.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.239
  - You're right, it doesn't.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.140
     But it can sure help.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.374
I mean when we open things up--

21:16.410 --> 21:18.443
  - Personally, I like walls.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.046
       I mean, see how
       easy it is for you

21:21.081 --> 21:22.047
      to get away from me?

21:22.082 --> 21:23.081
          With a wall.

21:25.919 --> 21:26.951
        Without a wall.

21:28.255 --> 21:29.054
          With a wall.

21:30.891 --> 21:32.257
            Without.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.992
    - Yeah, I got it, yeah.
    - What?

21:34.061 --> 21:37.262
     - You just can't help
     yourself, can you?

21:37.297 --> 21:38.563
            - What?

21:38.598 --> 21:41.166
      - You always have to
      give your two cents.

21:41.201 --> 21:42.400
        - My two cents.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.037
 I think my work is done here.

21:46.106 --> 21:47.405
    Carry on, it looks good.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.208
       - This definitely
       spruces things up.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.779
       - Now here I would
       like to take down

21:54.815 --> 21:56.448
     the walls on either
     side of the fireplace.

21:56.516 --> 21:57.682
      I just feel like
      there's a lot more--

21:57.718 --> 21:58.950
 - Uh, sorry to interrupt guys.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.819
      I'm going to go
      back to the office,

22:00.887 --> 22:02.554
     get out of your hair.

22:02.589 --> 22:03.354
        - Sounds great.

22:06.860 --> 22:08.893
   - Okay, well, see ya soon.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.765
    - Anyway that will also
    eliminate the sconces

22:13.800 --> 22:14.899
        which is a plus.

22:14.935 --> 22:16.334
     Because obviously
     they don't even work.

22:16.369 --> 22:17.569
            - Yeah.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.771
    - Um, that's enough to
    get you started, right?

22:19.806 --> 22:21.072
      - I'm already on it.

22:21.108 --> 22:21.873
- Okay, thanks, Skip.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.174
        You're the best.

22:23.210 --> 22:25.477
           Wally, hi.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.279
    Uh, did you get a donut?

22:28.315 --> 22:29.013
       I wasn't sure what
       you like so I got

22:29.049 --> 22:29.881
    a few different flavors.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.316
      - I'm going to pass.

22:31.351 --> 22:34.152
  - Okay, uh well, here it is.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.954
  This is the Lewisburg Manor.

22:36.022 --> 22:36.855
       What do you think?

22:38.125 --> 22:40.024
       - I have to admit,
       I like what I've

22:40.093 --> 22:41.960
      been seeing so far.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.828
  The dynamics, the sparring,

22:43.864 --> 22:45.130
          the history.

22:45.165 --> 22:48.399
    - I'm sorry, what
    exactly are you seeing?

22:48.435 --> 22:51.469
       - Uh, Wally was
       just taking a look

22:51.505 --> 22:53.037
        at some footage.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.413
  - I think we found our show.

23:04.351 --> 23:05.350
     - See ya later, guys.

23:19.432 --> 23:22.634
     - Hi, um you seriously
     want me to consult

23:22.669 --> 23:24.636
     with him on air, why?

23:24.704 --> 23:27.505
      - It was Wally's
      idea, but I get it.

23:27.541 --> 23:30.008
It creates chemistry, dynamics.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.277
- But this isn't a dating show.

23:32.345 --> 23:33.745
 What about the actual design?

23:33.814 --> 23:36.614
    - It's still your show,
    you are the designer.

23:37.951 --> 23:40.819
       - Okay, I know
       everybody wants us

23:40.854 --> 23:43.121
      to be amazing and so
      do I, but we don't

23:43.156 --> 23:44.556
       agree on anything.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.925
     - I think that's what
     Wally's banking on.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.828
      - I just don't think
      this is a good idea.

23:49.863 --> 23:50.962
             - Why?

23:50.997 --> 23:52.897
- Because...

23:52.933 --> 23:54.899
  We're always great at first.

23:54.968 --> 23:57.435
      That's why we've
      tried too many times

23:57.470 --> 24:00.805
   to make it work, but when
   it really matters, we...

24:00.841 --> 24:02.507
       We can't figure
       it out, you know.

24:02.542 --> 24:05.143
   And I just don't want
   that to happen with this.

24:05.212 --> 24:07.545
We're not asking you

24:07.581 --> 24:08.513
          to date him.

24:08.548 --> 24:11.316
      Just work with him.

24:12.519 --> 24:13.685
         Hannah, look.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.553
I know you love the show, okay?

24:15.622 --> 24:17.755
      But everyone has to
      love it, including

24:17.791 --> 24:18.590
          the network.

24:22.863 --> 24:24.128
       - Do we even know
       if he's up for it?

24:24.164 --> 24:27.065
   You know being on camera's
   not really his thing.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.199
   - I guess we'll find out.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.146
             - Hey.

24:42.182 --> 24:43.848
           - Oh, hi.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.383
   - You need a little help?

24:45.418 --> 24:46.551
     - No, no, it was just
     low tire pressure.

24:46.586 --> 24:49.187
    - Well I hope I didn't
    throw you off too much.

24:49.222 --> 24:50.989
- No.

24:54.194 --> 24:55.660
       You know, I still
       love it out here.

24:55.695 --> 24:58.162
       - Yeah, what would
       you always say?

24:58.231 --> 24:59.697
      Calm and inspiring?

25:02.035 --> 25:04.235
  - Yeah, with amazing views.

25:05.372 --> 25:07.538
     - Yeah, just like
     your design aesthetic.

25:14.414 --> 25:15.680
- You don't have to wait for me.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.649
      I'm sure you want
      to do another round.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.051
- Uh, , you know what?

25:20.086 --> 25:21.319
I'm going to give it another go.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.654
            - Yeah.

25:22.689 --> 25:23.521
    - You sure you're okay?

25:23.590 --> 25:24.389
     - Yeah, no, I'm fine.

25:24.424 --> 25:25.323
    Thank you for stopping.

25:25.392 --> 25:26.257
      - Oh no, of course.

25:27.394 --> 25:29.794
    I will see you at work.
    - Yeah.

25:31.498 --> 25:32.530
            - Okay.

25:35.869 --> 25:37.068
        - Welcome back.

25:37.103 --> 25:39.437
     This week Love in
     Design gets personal.

25:39.472 --> 25:42.173
     We traveled to my
     hometown of Lewisburg

25:42.208 --> 25:45.109
   to transform this manor
   into a bed and breakfast.

25:45.145 --> 25:47.011
    - Honestly, I don't know
    why you want to film me

25:47.047 --> 25:49.847
  but, uh, knock yourself out.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.082
   - So you're fine with it?

25:51.117 --> 25:53.885
    - I don't love the idea
    of being on camera, no.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.820
   It's just, I hope I don't
   have to object too much,

25:55.855 --> 25:58.556
    you know, so I can just
    fly under the radar.

25:59.459 --> 26:01.492
- I know Hannah will like that.

26:01.528 --> 26:04.495
- She's really
 good at this, isn't she?

26:04.564 --> 26:06.230
- What, the whole design thing?

26:06.266 --> 26:07.398
     - No, no, she's always
     been good at that.

26:07.434 --> 26:09.067
- Oh, being a host.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.668
  Yeah, the camera loves her.

26:10.704 --> 26:12.270
 And she's a super hard worker.

26:13.306 --> 26:15.139
      - Well, some things
      never change.

26:16.343 --> 26:17.475
       - So then you'll
       tune in next week

26:17.510 --> 26:19.911
     to see how the
     renovation progresses.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.179
       Let's keep going.

26:21.214 --> 26:22.347
           - And cut.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.383
            - Okay.
            - Great.

26:25.418 --> 26:26.250
- Yeah, I thought that distance

26:26.286 --> 26:27.518
   worked pretty well, right?

26:27.554 --> 26:28.853
- Yeah,
  felt pretty good.

26:31.825 --> 26:32.623
          - Excuse me.

26:35.528 --> 26:38.096
   Hey, I know this is a lot,

26:38.131 --> 26:39.297
     having everyone here.

26:39.366 --> 26:41.265
    How are you holding up?

26:41.334 --> 26:42.734
         - Good so far.

26:42.802 --> 26:43.534
  A little disoriented without

26:43.603 --> 26:44.936
       some of the walls.

26:46.473 --> 26:47.572
        - It'll start to
        take shape soon.

26:47.607 --> 26:49.340
     By the way, are there
     any design details

26:49.376 --> 26:50.475
       that you're after?
       - In here?

26:50.510 --> 26:52.243
- Yeah like, if there's anything

26:52.278 --> 26:54.345
     you wanna keep or
     you wanna get rid of?

26:55.548 --> 26:58.249
      - I think I want to
      keep those sconces.

27:00.553 --> 27:04.355
         - Oh, really?
         - Mm.

27:04.424 --> 27:07.425
- Is that a personal thing or--

27:07.460 --> 27:09.193
      - I saw them in a
      hotel lobby in Italy

27:09.229 --> 27:12.764
       and I thought, we
       should keep those.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.134
       - Well, I want to
       keep you happy.

27:17.370 --> 27:20.071
       - Oh, sorry, I
       need to take this.

27:20.106 --> 27:20.872
          - Of course.

27:26.579 --> 27:28.513
       - Sconces, really?

27:29.849 --> 27:31.149
       You hate sconces.

27:31.184 --> 27:33.718
I thought you'd wanna put up a--

27:33.753 --> 27:37.021
    - Big chandelier for
    impact and flexibility,

27:37.057 --> 27:38.589
      yeah but, that's
      not what she wants.

27:38.625 --> 27:40.358
- Well, that's kinda surprising.

27:41.561 --> 27:42.860
      Because back in the
      day you would've

27:42.896 --> 27:44.362
        shot that down.

27:44.431 --> 27:47.899
      - Well, things are
      a lot different now.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.868
 - Well, they don't have to be.

27:52.072 --> 27:53.905
       - Wait, are you
       trying to be cute

27:53.940 --> 27:55.573
        for the camera?

27:55.642 --> 27:56.841
    - The camera's on the
    ground, first off, okay?

27:56.876 --> 27:58.943
      I know that much,
      it's not on me, so.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.245
      - Oh, then what
      was all that about?

28:01.281 --> 28:03.081
    I'm sorry is there
    something architectural

28:03.116 --> 28:04.816
     you wanna talk
     about, Mr. Architect?

28:08.021 --> 28:10.855
   No, there you go, goodbye.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.202
       Is it bad that I'm
       glad he went back?

28:24.270 --> 28:25.470
         - Who, Wally?

28:26.739 --> 28:27.438
      Uh, no, I think
      it'd be weird if you

28:27.474 --> 28:28.840
      wanted him to stay.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.843
      He left quickly but
      not too quickly.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.778
 - He's just exhausting, right?

28:33.813 --> 28:35.346
     Be opinionated but...

28:35.381 --> 28:36.948
- Not too opinionated.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.217
      - Hold on a second.

28:40.086 --> 28:40.852
            Oh wow.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.590
      These are beautiful.

28:45.625 --> 28:46.624
           - Oh, hi.

28:47.427 --> 28:48.693
           Thank you.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.862
  You're doing the renovation
  on the manor house,

28:50.930 --> 28:51.662
          aren't you?

28:51.698 --> 28:52.930
           - Mm hmm.

28:52.966 --> 28:55.266
    - Well, here's my card,
    if you need anything.

28:55.335 --> 28:57.135
        - Oh, thank you.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.405
       - It's beautiful.

29:01.441 --> 29:03.741
     - Probably not modern
     enough but I think

29:03.776 --> 29:05.109
these pieces would look amazing

29:05.145 --> 29:06.611
    in your beach bungalow.

29:08.448 --> 29:10.848
   - So, how are you feeling?

29:10.884 --> 29:11.916
      Phase two, tomorrow!

29:14.154 --> 29:16.954
      - Honestly, blocked.

29:16.990 --> 29:18.756
     I've never had to work
     on a building this old

29:18.791 --> 29:19.924
   with so much to preserve.

29:21.227 --> 29:25.663
 And having a very
 opinionated ex isn't helping.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.933
     - Well, it's a good
     thing you're creative.

29:29.002 --> 29:29.967
        On both fronts.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.938
      You know him, right?

29:33.973 --> 29:35.339
            - Yeah.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.241
      - Then you know how
      to work around him.

29:37.310 --> 29:39.277
       You just gotta get
       a little creative.

30:26.426 --> 30:28.125
     - I really thought
     we'd get more daylight

30:28.194 --> 30:29.594
     in here when we
     knocked down that wall

30:29.662 --> 30:32.296
       but, as much as
       I hate to say it,

30:32.332 --> 30:34.131
      I think we need to
      swap out this window

30:34.167 --> 30:35.566
    for a more modern one--

30:35.602 --> 30:36.601
     - Sorry, quick thing.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.338
I don't know if I would do that.

30:41.441 --> 30:42.506
             - Why?

30:42.542 --> 30:43.841
    It's not street-facing,
    so we're not

30:43.876 --> 30:44.842
      breaking any rules.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.277
- It's just unique to the space.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.246
     - Yeah, I know, I get
     that but I'm going

30:48.281 --> 30:50.147
       big picture here.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.651
           Oh, wait.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.921
      This is you talking,
      not the committee.

30:56.990 --> 30:59.690
      - I just don't think
      that you'll get this

30:59.759 --> 31:01.225
     level of craftsmanship
     with a new one.

31:01.261 --> 31:03.494
    Do you remember that
    old, the bank building?

31:03.529 --> 31:04.295
       You know with the
       tattered shutters.

31:04.330 --> 31:05.329
            - Yeah.
            - Yeah

31:05.365 --> 31:06.330
      - I do.
      - It was beautiful.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.632
        - Horrible, they
        were all broken.

31:07.667 --> 31:08.199
      - But you're the one
      that painted them--

31:08.234 --> 31:09.233
        - What's the...

31:09.269 --> 31:10.468
    Stop, stop.
    - They were perfectly...

31:10.503 --> 31:11.235
    You told me it was--
    - We're not doing this.

31:11.304 --> 31:12.036
          - I'm going.

31:13.306 --> 31:15.473
- Coin toss, best out of three.

31:15.508 --> 31:16.374
          - You're on.

31:16.409 --> 31:17.541
  - Okay, anyone have a coin?

31:17.577 --> 31:20.244
    - Hannah, whatcha doin'?

31:20.280 --> 31:21.379
        - Settling this.

31:21.414 --> 31:22.680
       Getting creative.

31:22.715 --> 31:23.981
     Anyone?
     - Do you have a coin?

31:24.017 --> 31:24.682
- Are you guys
 playing a game right now?

31:24.717 --> 31:26.183
- Don't worry.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.018
   - This is the way we
   settle all disagreements.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.519
      - With a coin toss?

31:28.554 --> 31:29.687
     - Competition really,
     anything works.

31:29.722 --> 31:30.921
      Do you have a coin?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.456
      - Yeah, trust me,
      we figured this out

31:32.492 --> 31:34.091
        a long time ago.

31:34.127 --> 31:36.227
   One quick game solves a
   lot of personal gridlock.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.862
     Otherwise, we would
     be stuck here all day.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.163
           - All day.
           - Yeah.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.931
    Yeah, no, We just set
    up the rules and then...

31:40.967 --> 31:42.933
   Really, nobody has a coin?

31:43.870 --> 31:45.603
        - You know what?

31:45.638 --> 31:47.772
      We could always
      take this out back.

31:48.908 --> 31:51.175
     - Seems like a bit
     much, don't you think?

31:56.349 --> 31:57.315
          Okay, fine.
          - Okay.

31:57.350 --> 31:58.082
         - Yeah.
         - Yeah, great.

31:58.117 --> 31:58.983
           After you.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.518
   - Uh uh, wait, wait, guys.

32:05.892 --> 32:08.259
  Huh, who knew this was here?

32:08.294 --> 32:09.393
     - Apparently they did.

32:10.563 --> 32:15.433
      - Okay, if I win,
      your sidebar design

32:16.102 --> 32:17.468
       commentary stops.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.203
    I'm happy to hear
    anything that has to do

32:19.272 --> 32:20.771
       with committee
       restrictions but--

32:20.807 --> 32:23.741
      - Okay and if I win,
      you give my ideas

32:23.776 --> 32:25.776
      and opinions serious
      consideration.

32:25.812 --> 32:28.145
    Or we can go back inside

32:28.214 --> 32:29.046
      and try this again?

32:29.082 --> 32:30.414
       - Okay, tough guy.
       - Okay.

32:30.483 --> 32:32.783
      - Get ready to lose.

32:32.819 --> 32:34.118
         - Be my guest.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.319
            Please.

32:41.828 --> 32:45.196

33:08.287 --> 33:11.088
       - Well, I'm ready
       to go back inside

33:11.157 --> 33:11.889
        and get to work.

33:16.863 --> 33:19.964
      - Don't, just don't.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.433
          All of you.

33:23.336 --> 33:24.168
            - Um.
            - Okay.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.035
        - Got it.
        - Back to work.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.404
- Back to work again, everybody.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.043
       - That looks fun.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.945
  And tiring at the same time.

33:34.981 --> 33:36.847
- Yeah, what
  happened to the guy

33:36.883 --> 33:39.016
       that used to cycle
       10 miles a day?

33:39.051 --> 33:40.284
  - I don't see you up there.

33:40.319 --> 33:41.352
      - You know, the
      girls would love it

33:41.421 --> 33:42.119
      if you joined them.

33:42.155 --> 33:43.120
         Right, girls?

33:43.189 --> 33:44.255
- Yeah,
  yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.156
- Yeah, right girls?

33:45.191 --> 33:46.223
- Whose side are you on anyway?

33:46.292 --> 33:47.425
        - Yours, always.
        - Always?

33:47.460 --> 33:49.059
           - Always.
           - Always.

33:51.898 --> 33:55.499
       - So, how does it
       feel being home?

33:55.568 --> 33:56.267
          - Right now?

33:57.170 --> 33:58.702
        Uh, not so good.

33:58.738 --> 34:01.605
   I mean, this wasn't the
   job description, you know?

34:01.641 --> 34:02.807
       I'm not designing.

34:02.875 --> 34:03.774
   She doesn't want me there.

34:03.843 --> 34:05.643
 - Who doesn't want you there?

34:05.678 --> 34:07.311
            Hannah?

34:07.346 --> 34:08.279
    - You could've said no.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.280
    - What, to the project?

34:09.315 --> 34:10.181
     I just got hired, man.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.882
  I want to keep it that way.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.251
       - I'm going to
       check on the kids.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.085
      I'll be right back.

34:15.121 --> 34:15.985
        - Okay, thanks.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.388
  - Hey girls, you having fun?

34:17.422 --> 34:19.356
  - Look, I just, I just think
  there's a bigger reason

34:19.391 --> 34:20.925
       why you're there.
       - Yeah.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.159
       It's called work.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.027
      I know you with your
      sales flex hours,

34:24.063 --> 34:25.161
it's a concept that's difficult

34:25.197 --> 34:25.896
       for you to grasp.

34:25.965 --> 34:27.364
          - Oh, ha ha.

34:28.801 --> 34:30.900
       Or maybe you just
       can't shake it.

34:32.737 --> 34:33.437
            - Shake?

34:33.473 --> 34:34.271
          Shake what?

34:35.174 --> 34:35.940
             - Her.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.242
    - You tend to gravitate.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.210
          - Gravitate.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.713
     - Yeah, we're friends.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.583
   We're friendly, you know?

34:45.650 --> 34:46.984
      - Yeah, is that why
      you look like that

34:47.018 --> 34:48.518
 every time you talk about her?

34:50.422 --> 34:51.889
Whoa, hey.

34:51.924 --> 34:53.123
Girls, girls.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.257
- Hey, whoa, whoa, hey, no, no.

34:54.293 --> 34:55.326
    We'll play after lunch.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.327
We'll play after--

34:56.362 --> 34:57.828
      Oh hey, no, hey, no.
      - Girls.

34:57.864 --> 34:59.897
- I'm running shots.

35:08.007 --> 35:08.973
      - You still working?

35:09.008 --> 35:09.740
           This late?

35:09.775 --> 35:10.908
           - I know.

35:10.943 --> 35:13.043
I'm just trying to get it right.

35:14.580 --> 35:15.479
 - Well, whatever you're doing,

35:15.515 --> 35:16.747
       they're liking it.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.883
       So, why don't you
       just enjoy that.

35:18.918 --> 35:22.286
      - I should, but it's
      driving me crazy.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.522
 I keep second guessing myself.

35:24.557 --> 35:27.291
       - I'm sure it's a
       lot of pressure.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.894
       - It's just there
       are so many people

35:29.929 --> 35:32.162
       wanting so many
       different things.

35:32.198 --> 35:35.432
   And not just here, at
   the network and I have to

35:35.468 --> 35:37.568
      try to make all
      those people happy.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.005
   - Remember what I do
   when I'm feeling stressed

35:41.040 --> 35:43.073
     or just a little, mah?

35:45.344 --> 35:46.710
     - Put on a good tune?

35:49.949 --> 35:52.416
     - And then everything
     just sort of

35:55.087 --> 35:56.654
       comes into focus.

35:59.325 --> 36:00.558
  - I'll admit, it does help.

36:04.196 --> 36:04.929
          Thanks, mom.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.233
- Well, I will leave you to it.

36:15.575 --> 36:17.708
      - Updating a dining
      room into something

36:17.743 --> 36:20.377
      more functional for
      a B&B while still

36:20.446 --> 36:24.181
    maintaining the historic
    charm, that's the issue.

36:25.051 --> 36:25.816
         The solution?

36:28.821 --> 36:31.055
    A slight change of plan.

36:31.090 --> 36:32.990
     I still want to
     knock down both walls

36:33.025 --> 36:35.826
    on either side of the
    fireplace, but I'd also

36:35.895 --> 36:37.928
       like to remove
       these two windows,

36:37.964 --> 36:39.163
knock down the wall between them

36:39.198 --> 36:41.865
  and create one large window.

36:41.934 --> 36:43.000
        - Um, I'm sorry.

36:43.803 --> 36:44.702
           - Oh, hey.

36:44.737 --> 36:46.236
   It's our guest architect.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.339
      - Oh, hey, hey guys.

36:48.374 --> 36:51.442
    Um, what about this
    big window right there?

36:51.510 --> 36:54.445
       - This is street
       facing with cars.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.113
     This would be a vista.

36:56.148 --> 36:58.616
     - Yeah, but this is a
     historical building.

36:58.684 --> 37:01.118
     - I know, which means
     that we can't make

37:01.153 --> 37:03.320
   any structural alterations
   to the exterior

37:03.389 --> 37:05.255
       without approval.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.024
  - Yeah, but the Preservation
  Committee will never

37:07.059 --> 37:09.026
         approve that.

37:09.095 --> 37:10.060
  - Think of what you'd gain.

37:10.096 --> 37:10.928
       The views you'd
       have in here if we

37:10.963 --> 37:13.063
opened this up to the backyard?

37:13.099 --> 37:14.298
            - Yeah.

37:14.333 --> 37:14.999
   - This would be an
   incredible communal space.

37:15.034 --> 37:15.966
    - It's not gonna happen.

37:16.002 --> 37:17.067
    - Not if you don't ask.

37:17.103 --> 37:18.736
      - This wall was
      built for a reason.

37:18.771 --> 37:20.170
        - In the 1800s.

37:33.519 --> 37:38.288
Unless we bring the outside in.

37:40.259 --> 37:42.626
      - What do you mean?

37:42.662 --> 37:45.195
   - We could create a large
   mural of the grounds

37:45.231 --> 37:47.631
    right here, like we're
    looking out of a window.

37:49.402 --> 37:53.103
  - So you keep the feeling
  without losing the history.

37:53.172 --> 37:53.904
           - Exactly.

38:00.680 --> 38:01.445
          - I like it.

38:03.649 --> 38:05.716
            - Yeah?
            - Yeah.

38:07.653 --> 38:08.652
      - Wait, what's that?

38:09.822 --> 38:12.990
 Oh, it's the sound of change.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.026
       Not so bad, right?

38:16.095 --> 38:16.927
- You know, you're as impressive

38:16.962 --> 38:17.761
         as I remember.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.635
           - And cut.

38:29.675 --> 38:32.109
- This
  heat is killing me.

38:32.178 --> 38:33.911
  They said the new AC should
  start working tomorrow,

38:33.979 --> 38:36.947
but in the mean time, survival.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.315
       - Why don't I help
       ya out with this.

38:38.384 --> 38:39.550
      - Great, thank you.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.952
 - All right guys, any takers?

38:42.988 --> 38:44.822
        - Oh, good news.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.256
            - Okay.

38:46.292 --> 38:47.624
      - So the network has
      seen the first week

38:47.660 --> 38:51.228
  of dailies and they are
  loving what they're seeing.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.332
    And it's not just Wally,
    so, they wanna screen

38:55.367 --> 38:57.401
a preview of the first episode.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.036
         - A screening?

38:59.071 --> 39:00.437
            - Where?

39:00.473 --> 39:02.306
  - It's gonna kick off your
  "cinema series in the park."

39:02.341 --> 39:04.274
         Tonight, 6:30.

39:04.310 --> 39:05.442
           - Tonight?

39:05.478 --> 39:06.977
     - Oh wait, they want
     to screen a rough cut

39:07.012 --> 39:08.378
      to the entire town?

39:08.447 --> 39:09.513
  - Yeah, I guess it's one way

39:09.548 --> 39:11.148
   to get the locals excited.

39:11.217 --> 39:13.817
      - Okay, I mean, I'm
      sure it'll be great.

39:13.853 --> 39:14.885
      - And they want
      you to go together.

39:14.954 --> 39:16.653
            - What?
            - Why?

39:16.689 --> 39:18.455
      - Well, you're both
      on screen, so...

39:18.491 --> 39:21.391
       It's just a casual
       meet and greet.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.061
     - Well, no one really
     knows who I am.

39:24.096 --> 39:25.562
- Well, most people in town do.

39:25.598 --> 39:26.530
- Yeah but nobody really cares.

39:26.565 --> 39:27.598
       - I have to agree.

39:27.633 --> 39:28.699
      - It's all just for
      publicity, okay?

39:28.734 --> 39:30.267
   Super casual, like I said.

39:30.302 --> 39:33.437
      Well, except Wally's
      flying in for it so.

39:33.506 --> 39:34.538
            - Right.

39:35.608 --> 39:36.473
         - Yeah, okay.

39:36.509 --> 39:38.442
 Well, I'll pick ya up at six?

39:42.014 --> 39:43.180
             - Yep.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.184
     - This should be fun.
     - Should be.

40:24.456 --> 40:25.622
  - Oh my gosh, this is still

40:25.691 --> 40:26.990
the best lemonade I've ever had.

40:27.026 --> 40:28.158
      What's your secret?

40:28.194 --> 40:29.293
            - Sugar.

40:30.196 --> 40:31.161
  - Sugar, that's your secret?

40:31.230 --> 40:33.330
 - The lemons are always fresh.

40:33.365 --> 40:36.500
   - And a sprig of rosemary
   but, mostly sugar.

40:37.503 --> 40:41.138
           - Mm, wow.

40:42.374 --> 40:44.074
    I am having a flashback.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.309
       - Of high school?

40:45.377 --> 40:47.244
- And several summers
  after that,.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.681
     We spent so much time
     in that greenhouse,

40:50.749 --> 40:52.216
         Hannah and I.

40:52.251 --> 40:56.019
  Reading, listening to
  music, planting new flowers.

40:56.055 --> 40:58.121
- Well, we
  love it out here.

40:58.157 --> 40:59.122
       - Which is why I
       wish you'd let me

40:59.158 --> 41:00.290
      get my hands on it.

41:07.399 --> 41:08.966
       - You look, great.

41:12.004 --> 41:13.036
           - Thanks.

41:16.342 --> 41:17.641
 We should probably get going.

41:17.676 --> 41:18.642
    We don't wanna be late.

41:19.645 --> 41:23.180
       - Uh, yeah, right.

41:25.017 --> 41:25.916
      - We'll see ya soon.

41:25.951 --> 41:26.683
   We'll be right behind you.

41:26.719 --> 41:27.851
    - Good to see you guys.

41:28.687 --> 41:29.386
         And thank you.

41:34.326 --> 41:37.794
   - So I thought you hardly
   drove this car anymore.

41:37.830 --> 41:38.595
           - I don't.

41:45.337 --> 41:46.303
          - Thank you.

42:25.244 --> 42:26.476
     Yeah, I can't believe
     you still have

42:26.545 --> 42:27.711
         that keychain.

42:27.746 --> 42:30.013
    - Oh, that's one of
    Patrick's better gifts.

42:37.756 --> 42:38.622
           You okay?

42:38.657 --> 42:39.723
            - Yeah.

42:44.596 --> 42:45.595
          Okay, fine.

42:45.631 --> 42:48.198
It's just with this new format,

42:48.233 --> 42:50.133
   you know, I want everyone
   to be happy, but--

42:50.169 --> 42:51.268
          - Everyone?

42:51.303 --> 42:52.569
   That's a real tall order.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.940
 When did you start caring
 about what other people think?

42:58.811 --> 43:01.878
   - When I realized how
   many people are depending

43:01.914 --> 43:03.280
   on me to keep this going.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.750
 - You're doing an amazing job.

43:08.220 --> 43:10.354
   And that's all you can do.

43:14.460 --> 43:15.892
         You know what?

43:15.928 --> 43:18.729
 If I were you I would just...

43:18.764 --> 43:20.364
       Block it all out.

43:21.266 --> 43:22.432
           Honestly.

43:22.468 --> 43:23.800
      It's what I'm doing
      with all this.

43:23.836 --> 43:26.803
    - You really don't care
    what anyone thinks?

43:26.872 --> 43:28.438
             - No.

43:28.507 --> 43:29.473
       - And you're gonna
       be totally open

43:29.508 --> 43:31.475
       to hearing all of
       their opinions?

43:31.510 --> 43:33.610
       - Yes, yes I will.

43:33.645 --> 43:35.545
 - I'm gonna quote you on that.

43:35.581 --> 43:37.347
      - Okay, you do that.

43:38.684 --> 43:39.816
    Come on, let's do this.

43:50.129 --> 43:51.161
          Here you go.

43:51.196 --> 43:53.630
        - Oh, thank you.
        - No problem.

44:07.546 --> 44:08.278
             - Hi.

44:11.483 --> 44:12.616
        Good to see you.

44:14.286 --> 44:16.186
            Hey, hi.

44:16.221 --> 44:18.288
      Welcome, thank you
      so much for coming.

44:25.130 --> 44:26.830
      - Can everyone
      please find a seat?

44:26.899 --> 44:28.131
   We will be starting soon.

44:30.903 --> 44:32.769
       We hope you enjoy
       this sneak peek

44:32.805 --> 44:35.939
  of the season five
  premiere of Love in Design.

44:47.286 --> 44:49.920
       - Advertisement.
       - That's awesome.

44:51.390 --> 44:52.689
Welcome back to Love in Design,

44:52.758 --> 44:56.226
   and this is demo week here
   at the Lewisburg Manor.

44:56.261 --> 44:58.161
    It's a very exciting day
    because the homeowner

44:58.197 --> 45:00.764
    herself, Margot, will be
    making the first strike

45:00.799 --> 45:03.400
       on that first wall
       we're taking down.

45:03.469 --> 45:04.234
              Go!

45:05.104 --> 45:06.303
             Yeah!

45:06.338 --> 45:07.871
      I think we need to
      swap out this window

45:07.906 --> 45:11.007
   for a more modern one
   that lets in better light.

45:11.043 --> 45:11.875
       - Uh, quick thing.

45:15.848 --> 45:17.547
 I don't know if I can do that.

45:17.616 --> 45:19.015
             - Why?

45:19.084 --> 45:20.050
 It's not street facing, so
 we're not breaking any rules.

45:20.085 --> 45:20.817
 - You want to get out of here?

45:20.886 --> 45:22.452
       Come on, let's go.

45:24.957 --> 45:25.789
         - Wait, wait--

45:25.824 --> 45:27.491
- You realize that--

45:27.559 --> 45:30.560
- This is you
 talking, not the committee.

45:30.629 --> 45:33.296
   - Why didn't you tell me?

45:33.332 --> 45:35.098
        - Tell you what?

45:35.134 --> 45:37.667
       - That I pause...

45:39.271 --> 45:40.170
             A lot.

45:41.373 --> 45:42.906
  - At least you don't say um.

45:42.941 --> 45:44.007
      - Is that any worse?

45:45.310 --> 45:47.577
           - Um, yes.

45:49.248 --> 45:50.914
         No, I get it.

45:50.983 --> 45:52.182
  It's hard to watch yourself.

45:54.286 --> 45:55.752
  - You were perfect as usual.

45:56.588 --> 45:57.387
          - As usual?

45:59.858 --> 46:02.125
      - I really like that
      floating staircase.

46:02.194 --> 46:05.595
    Not for me, but for that
    house, it really worked.

46:07.332 --> 46:08.632
   - You have seen the show.

46:09.434 --> 46:10.867
 - I've seen all four seasons.

46:13.438 --> 46:14.771
            - What?

46:14.806 --> 46:17.207
      Okay, then you have
      to admit, modern

46:17.242 --> 46:18.942
     is kind of liberating.

46:18.977 --> 46:20.443
     You're not constrained
     by the past,

46:20.479 --> 46:21.745
      it's a blank canvas.

46:21.780 --> 46:24.781
      You can go anywhere,
      it's exciting.

46:26.018 --> 46:27.417
             What?

46:27.452 --> 46:32.289
 - It's just, the sky has
 always been the limit for you,

46:32.324 --> 46:33.890
      it always has been.

46:33.926 --> 46:34.925
        It's impressive.

46:36.395 --> 46:37.794
  But it's hard to hold onto.

46:50.976 --> 46:51.708
    - I think they liked it.

46:51.743 --> 46:52.809
    - I think they did too.

46:55.781 --> 46:59.115
    - Well done, honey, that
    was really terrific.

46:59.151 --> 46:59.849
           - Thanks.

46:59.918 --> 47:00.884
      - You were amazing.

47:00.919 --> 47:02.285
 - Everyone seemed to like it.

47:02.354 --> 47:04.521
     - Okay, we're gonna
     see you back at home.

47:04.556 --> 47:06.122
        - Okay, thanks.

47:07.659 --> 47:09.259
  - I think everyone loved it.

47:09.294 --> 47:10.026
            - Yeah?

47:10.062 --> 47:11.494
         - I loved it.

47:11.530 --> 47:13.430
I just think we can be a
little more,.

47:14.333 --> 47:16.032
But not too,.

47:18.704 --> 47:19.536
      I gotta find Julie.

47:23.242 --> 47:24.007
             - Oh.

47:24.042 --> 47:25.675
             - Hey.

47:25.711 --> 47:27.611
 - I never thought I'd see you

47:27.646 --> 47:29.212
     up on that big screen.

47:30.515 --> 47:33.516
    - Whoa, I can't believe
    I know someone famous.

47:33.585 --> 47:35.885
- Well, I wouldn't go that far.

47:35.921 --> 47:37.354
- Why do you look shorter on TV?

47:37.389 --> 47:39.155
       - Shorter, really?

47:39.191 --> 47:40.123
             - No.

47:40.158 --> 47:40.991
        - Yeah, oh yeah,
        it's like, tiny.

47:42.261 --> 47:43.293
            - What?

47:43.362 --> 47:45.362
       Hey, did you guys
       say hi to Hannah?

47:45.397 --> 47:47.097
      - Yeah, yeah, I said
      hi to her earlier,

47:47.132 --> 47:48.431
       but I have to get
       these kids home,

47:48.467 --> 47:50.100
    so you guys fun tonight.

47:50.168 --> 47:50.900
- Okay.

47:50.936 --> 47:51.668
        - Thanks, babe.

47:51.703 --> 47:52.435
    - All right, bye, guys.

47:52.471 --> 47:53.937
        - Thanks, baby.

47:53.972 --> 47:55.272
       - You staying out?

47:55.307 --> 47:56.773
  - It's your big debut, man.

47:56.842 --> 47:58.008
 Come on, we need to celebrate.

47:58.043 --> 47:59.142
          - Yes we do.

47:59.177 --> 47:59.943
    - I'll say hi to Hannah.

47:59.978 --> 48:02.412
    - Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:02.447 --> 48:03.246
- Hey.

48:03.282 --> 48:04.547
             - Hey.

48:04.583 --> 48:05.548
     - I was wondering when
     I would run into you.

48:05.617 --> 48:06.383
       - It's so good to
       see you, Hannah.

48:06.451 --> 48:07.317
        You look great.

48:07.352 --> 48:08.718
          - Thank you.

48:08.754 --> 48:10.587
  I saw your kids earlier,
  they're so grown up already.

48:10.656 --> 48:12.355
     - Yeah, and they loved
     the whole premiere.

48:12.391 --> 48:13.490
          We all did.

48:13.525 --> 48:14.457
 - Kind of crazy though, right?

48:14.493 --> 48:15.892
        The two of us on
        camera together?

48:15.927 --> 48:18.461
       - Yeah, it's a bit
       of a throwback,

48:18.497 --> 48:20.263
   but hey, I think we
   celebrate tonight, right?

48:20.299 --> 48:22.232
 I'm thinking, what, Sparrows?

48:22.267 --> 48:23.033
          - Sparrows.

48:23.068 --> 48:24.034
          - Sparrows.

48:24.069 --> 48:25.035
             - Yes.
             - Yes.

48:25.070 --> 48:26.369
       - I would love to,
       but I told Julie

48:26.438 --> 48:27.170
       we'd go out, so...

48:27.205 --> 48:28.238
        - Yeah you did.

48:28.273 --> 48:29.939
    So, where are we going?

48:30.008 --> 48:30.940
- Sparrows.

48:31.009 --> 48:32.375
      - Sounds good to me.

48:32.411 --> 48:34.911
       - Looks like we're
       going to Sparrows.

48:38.550 --> 48:40.717
- I think it's
 time for a toast, folks.

48:43.488 --> 48:46.589
     Well, to a very
     unusual and dare I say

48:46.625 --> 48:48.925
      extremely successful
      screening, cheers.

48:48.960 --> 48:49.893
       - Cheers to that.

48:49.928 --> 48:50.694
           - Cheers.

48:50.729 --> 48:51.528
           - Cheers.

48:53.632 --> 48:56.399
 - Okay, now, no more work talk

48:56.435 --> 48:58.435
for the rest of the night, yeah?

48:58.470 --> 48:59.469
            - Right

48:59.504 --> 49:00.236
            - Done.

49:00.272 --> 49:02.138
     - Yeah, okay, got it.

49:04.843 --> 49:05.608
         I got nothing.

49:08.080 --> 49:09.446
      - Hey, I don't know
      about you guys,

49:09.514 --> 49:10.547
       but I am starving.

49:10.582 --> 49:11.881
      - Yeah, I could eat.

49:11.950 --> 49:13.783
   - I heard they have really
   good fish tacos here.

49:13.819 --> 49:14.584
         - Twice fried.

49:14.619 --> 49:15.885
      - Right up my alley.

49:15.921 --> 49:18.388
     - I'm up for whatever,
     spicier the better.

49:18.457 --> 49:19.189
           - Me too.

49:23.729 --> 49:24.494
             What?

49:27.165 --> 49:27.931
     I'm up for new things.

49:27.966 --> 49:29.366
             - You?

49:29.401 --> 49:31.134
      - Don't let this guy
      fool you, all right?

49:31.169 --> 49:32.202
            - Okay.

49:34.172 --> 49:35.772
    - Yes, they still do it.

49:35.841 --> 49:38.174
 Who is ready for some trivia?

49:38.210 --> 49:39.542
          - Oh, I am.

49:39.578 --> 49:41.378
   - The only game these two

49:41.413 --> 49:42.746
       can play together.

49:42.781 --> 49:44.881
     - The last time we
     teamed up, unbeatable.

49:44.950 --> 49:45.682
         - Unbeatable.

49:45.717 --> 49:47.584
     I'm gonna sign us up.

49:47.619 --> 49:48.418
     - I'm coming with you.
     - Okay.

49:48.453 --> 49:49.686
     - Guaranteed winning.

49:49.721 --> 49:50.920
        - Good choices.

49:50.989 --> 49:52.122
    - What's our team name?

49:53.125 --> 49:54.591
       - Wow, trivia, eh?

49:55.861 --> 49:59.162
    - Do you have something
    to do with this?

49:59.197 --> 50:00.463
            - What?

50:00.499 --> 50:03.566
 It's Ali, I can't take credit.

50:09.574 --> 50:10.340
             - 385.

50:10.375 --> 50:11.474
        - Are you sure?

50:11.510 --> 50:12.542
- Yes, I'm
  sure, write it down.

50:12.611 --> 50:13.610
       - 385, all right.

50:13.645 --> 50:14.477
- What
  U.S. city is home

50:14.546 --> 50:15.645
to the world's first skyscraper?

50:15.714 --> 50:16.279
       - We can do this.
       - Chicago.

50:17.315 --> 50:18.181
   - We are so winning this.

50:18.216 --> 50:20.350
- Summer of 69 written?

50:20.419 --> 50:24.888
       - '84, totally 84.

50:24.956 --> 50:25.688
          - You sure?

50:25.724 --> 50:27.090
          Okay, okay.

50:27.125 --> 50:29.626
- And the winner is.

50:35.167 --> 50:36.900
- We totally did it.

50:36.935 --> 50:37.901
          - Way to go.

50:48.547 --> 50:49.612
      - I keep forgetting
      that you're like

50:49.681 --> 50:51.881
an encyclopedia of random facts.

50:51.917 --> 50:54.417
 - Well, look, I mean, everyone
 gets to have an opinion

50:54.453 --> 50:57.320
      about paint color,
      but no one can argue

50:57.355 --> 50:59.355
      the number of steps
      in the Eiffel Tower.

50:59.391 --> 51:01.291
  - That is a very good point.

51:01.326 --> 51:02.292
        How many steps?

51:02.360 --> 51:03.426
     - In the Eiffel Tower?

51:03.462 --> 51:04.394
            - Yeah.

51:04.429 --> 51:05.962
            - 1,710.

51:05.997 --> 51:08.264
     - You're the smartest
     person I know.

51:08.300 --> 51:10.200
     - Well, you're pretty
     smart yourself.

51:12.137 --> 51:14.838
      - Book smart maybe,
      but not always

51:14.906 --> 51:15.939
     smart where it counts.

51:21.913 --> 51:23.880
           - Well...

51:24.916 --> 51:26.549
 Thank you for driving me home.

51:28.019 --> 51:30.587
        And for tonight.

51:33.225 --> 51:33.990
          It was fun.

51:37.028 --> 51:37.760
           - It was.

51:47.939 --> 51:48.738
            Hannah.

51:51.376 --> 51:53.877
       Love in Design, is
       that your title?

51:55.747 --> 51:57.680
      - How did you know?

51:57.716 --> 51:59.682
    - Just seemed like you.

52:34.786 --> 52:35.552
        - Good morning.

52:36.588 --> 52:37.353
- Honey?

52:39.391 --> 52:41.658
    - You've been wanting to
    renovate your backyard

52:41.693 --> 52:42.959
           for years.

52:42.994 --> 52:44.694
       I've been wanting
       to renovate your

52:44.729 --> 52:47.363
  backyard for you for years.

52:47.432 --> 52:49.899
     Please, let me do it.

52:53.171 --> 52:53.870
            - Okay.

52:53.939 --> 52:55.405
- Go for it.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.873
             - Yes!

53:10.855 --> 53:12.589
 I put a call in to the artist.

53:12.657 --> 53:15.191
      I saw his work at
      the farmer's market.

53:15.260 --> 53:16.759
      And you know, I
      really like the idea

53:16.795 --> 53:18.194
      of keeping it local.

53:18.229 --> 53:20.496
      - I do too, as long
      as everything's

53:20.532 --> 53:21.798
       done in time for
       the grand opening.

53:21.833 --> 53:23.299
  Invitations are already out.

53:23.368 --> 53:25.368
    - We will make it work.

53:25.403 --> 53:27.036
   - Then enjoy your weekend.

53:27.105 --> 53:28.137
     - Thank you, you too.

53:32.877 --> 53:33.876
     - You have any plans?

53:36.615 --> 53:38.214
       - For the weekend?

53:39.050 --> 53:40.850
     A little side project.

53:42.487 --> 53:44.287
     - Your parents' deck?

53:44.356 --> 53:45.488
            - What?

53:45.523 --> 53:46.723
     - You've been eyeing
     that thing for years.

53:47.592 --> 53:48.858
          - Well done.

53:48.893 --> 53:50.460
      - So, does that mean
      you won't have time

53:50.528 --> 53:51.494
      to hang out with me?

53:52.597 --> 53:54.697
     - Is that a challenge
     to see how fast

53:54.766 --> 53:55.965
       I can get it done?

53:56.001 --> 53:56.899
            - Maybe.

53:56.935 --> 53:57.934
     - Challenge accepted.

54:04.843 --> 54:07.210
- Are you sure
  you won't let us help?

54:07.278 --> 54:08.678
     This looks like a lot.

54:08.747 --> 54:10.446
 - Trust me, I've got a system.

54:12.584 --> 54:13.950
          - But still.

54:13.985 --> 54:17.720
     - I'm excited, so go,
     go see a movie or have

54:17.756 --> 54:18.888
      lunch or something.

54:18.923 --> 54:20.556
      Just give me a
      little bit of notice

54:20.625 --> 54:22.125
  before you come back, okay?

54:24.262 --> 54:25.194
           Trust me.

54:25.230 --> 54:26.162
        This is gonna be
        a piece of cake.

54:26.197 --> 54:27.196
         - We're going.

54:27.232 --> 54:29.899
     - Good, thank you, go.

54:29.934 --> 54:30.700
          - I'm going.

54:31.469 --> 54:32.368
          - Have fun.

54:36.708 --> 54:40.209
     - We going with extra
     protein or no protein?

54:40.245 --> 54:41.844
   I saw the bike out front.

54:41.880 --> 54:44.380
       - Go with protein.

54:44.416 --> 54:45.181
         - You got it.

54:49.320 --> 54:52.422
    - You know what, Carol,
    on second thought...

55:06.471 --> 55:07.203
           Delivery.

55:10.375 --> 55:11.274
Thought you might need a little

55:11.309 --> 55:13.176
 extra fuel for the challenge.

55:21.853 --> 55:22.919
      Look, I know you're
      in the middle of it,

55:22.954 --> 55:25.455
       so you don't have
       to eat right now.

55:25.523 --> 55:26.589
 - Thank you so much for this.

55:26.658 --> 55:28.357
       - I didn't know if
       your parents were

55:28.426 --> 55:29.625
       gonna be here, so
       I got some extra.

55:29.661 --> 55:30.793
      You start every
      season with donuts,

55:30.829 --> 55:32.929
     so I figured we
     could start your deck

55:32.997 --> 55:34.130
      renos with takeout.

55:36.935 --> 55:40.336
       By the way, what
       can I do to help?

55:40.371 --> 55:43.339
      - Oh, I have a whole
      load of laundry.

55:43.408 --> 55:45.174
      - That's very funny.

55:48.546 --> 55:50.880
   - Actually, everything is
   going pretty well so far.

55:50.915 --> 55:51.914
     The guys will be
     here in a few minutes

55:51.950 --> 55:53.916
     to put up the pergola.

55:53.985 --> 55:56.753
     - Well, it looks like
     you still need help.

55:56.788 --> 55:58.755
      - I don't need help.

56:00.191 --> 56:01.791
       - I'm not taking
       no for an answer.

56:03.428 --> 56:04.694
       - You wanna work?

56:04.729 --> 56:05.695
        - I wanna work.

56:05.730 --> 56:06.562
            - Yeah?

56:06.598 --> 56:08.030
  Okay, all right, let's work.

56:08.066 --> 56:09.832
   - All right, let's do it.

56:09.901 --> 56:10.900
      - Unwrap these guys.

56:14.072 --> 56:15.972
      - So, anything else?

56:16.007 --> 56:20.543
   - No, I mean, um, well...

56:20.578 --> 56:22.011
   There might be one thing.

56:22.914 --> 56:24.247
         - Okay, shoot.

56:25.383 --> 56:26.582
      - You could talk
      to the Preservation

56:26.651 --> 56:27.850
       Committee about
       building a pergola

56:27.886 --> 56:29.018
       outside the manor.

56:29.053 --> 56:30.253
        - Work, really?

56:30.288 --> 56:32.555
    - I know, I just, I
    just, you're right here,

56:32.590 --> 56:34.991
and we only have two weeks left.

56:35.960 --> 56:38.561
      Think about it, for
      a B&B, vacation,

56:38.596 --> 56:40.730
  being outside is everything,

56:40.799 --> 56:42.431
  so if I were staying there--

56:42.467 --> 56:43.733
     - You'd want somewhere
     to lounge outside.

56:43.768 --> 56:44.934
        - I mean, I know
        we'd be building

56:44.969 --> 56:46.903
     a structure that's
     not in the same style

56:46.938 --> 56:48.871
     as the manor, and I
     know that's an issue,

56:48.940 --> 56:50.573
       but it would make
       the whole outside

56:50.608 --> 56:51.707
       more of a feature.

56:52.577 --> 56:53.543
       What do you think?

56:56.848 --> 56:57.613
            - Okay.

56:58.783 --> 57:00.383
     - You'll talk to them.

57:00.418 --> 57:01.184
             - But.

57:01.219 --> 57:02.385
           - Really?

57:02.453 --> 57:03.519
       - You have to come
       with me, okay?

57:03.588 --> 57:04.320
      You're obviously the
      more persuasive one.

57:04.389 --> 57:05.221
    - That would be amazing.

57:05.256 --> 57:06.656
   - And under one condition.

57:06.691 --> 57:07.557
           - Name it.

57:07.592 --> 57:09.058
   - No more work talk today.

57:09.093 --> 57:10.393
           Let's eat.

57:10.428 --> 57:11.227
            - Deal.

57:15.500 --> 57:18.734
      My dad was knee-deep
      in tax season.

57:18.770 --> 57:20.970
 My mom was working a ton too,

57:21.005 --> 57:23.673
      and yet every
      weekend for months,

57:23.741 --> 57:26.776
  they'd be out there
  working on that greenhouse,

57:26.845 --> 57:29.812
    helping me plant my
    favorite flowers inside.

57:29.848 --> 57:31.280
       Oh, they wanted to
       make sure it was

57:31.316 --> 57:33.583
    ready for my 10th
    birthday, and they did.

57:33.618 --> 57:36.118
     Some days, it was
     like 100 degrees out.

57:36.154 --> 57:37.320
My mom would make her lemonade,

57:37.355 --> 57:40.189
       and we'd sit and
       watch my dad work.

57:40.225 --> 57:42.191
I swear, he never took a break.

57:42.227 --> 57:45.094
       - So that's where
       you get it from.

57:46.898 --> 57:50.266
 - So, this is like the tiniest
 thing I can do for them.

57:52.704 --> 57:54.036
- I think they're gonna love it.

57:56.107 --> 57:56.973
     - Even the gray teak?

57:57.008 --> 57:59.041
  - Especially the gray teak.

58:03.047 --> 58:03.813
         This is nice.

58:05.283 --> 58:06.582
           - Sitting?

58:06.618 --> 58:07.350
         - Being here.

58:08.953 --> 58:09.719
           With you.

58:14.959 --> 58:18.427
   You know, I never stopped
   thinking about you.

58:18.463 --> 58:20.863
   - That's because you like
   to hold on to things.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.267
         - I'm serious.

58:24.302 --> 58:25.301
           - So am I.

58:29.274 --> 58:34.176
  - I never wanted to break
  up with you, you know that?

58:35.046 --> 58:35.778
      I had to let you go.

58:36.948 --> 58:39.048
      I mean, you had this
      great opportunity.

58:39.083 --> 58:41.751
  - I said we could just see.

58:41.819 --> 58:45.655
I was willing to take that risk.

58:45.723 --> 58:48.958
      - But you've always
      had something to do,

58:48.993 --> 58:51.327
        see, accomplish.

58:51.396 --> 58:52.929
- You wanted to come back here,

58:52.964 --> 58:54.263
      that was your plan.

58:54.332 --> 58:56.232
     You never even wanted
     to visit Los Angeles.

58:56.267 --> 58:57.199
      - It was ridiculous.

58:58.069 --> 58:59.435
But I knew you had to be there,

58:59.470 --> 59:00.770
   and I wanted that for you.

59:03.207 --> 59:06.876
      I just, I never knew
      how to let you go.

59:20.391 --> 59:21.924
       - I tried to keep
       your mother away

59:21.993 --> 59:22.825
      as long as possible.

59:22.860 --> 59:23.693
   - We were just so excited.

59:23.761 --> 59:26.729
  Oh, this is a nice surprise.

59:26.764 --> 59:28.164
          - Hey, guys.

59:29.500 --> 59:30.333
       - Ready to see it?

59:31.169 --> 59:32.735
 Okay, don't look, don't look.

59:32.770 --> 59:34.437
         - Okay, okay.

59:34.505 --> 59:35.404
       - Yeah, I got you.

59:35.473 --> 59:36.939
       - Okay, you ready?

59:36.975 --> 59:39.408
     One, two, three, tada!

59:42.313 --> 59:43.312
- Oh my.

59:43.348 --> 59:45.247
- Oh, wow.

59:45.283 --> 59:48.150
    - This is, it's amazing.

59:48.186 --> 59:49.018
         - You like it?

59:49.053 --> 59:50.119
     - We love it, sweetie.

59:51.689 --> 59:52.755
          - Thank you.

59:52.790 --> 59:53.856
         - Oh my gosh.

59:55.259 --> 59:56.959
          - Thank you.

59:56.995 --> 59:58.160
       - You're welcome.

01:00:20.251 --> 01:00:22.351
    Did you mean to do this?

01:00:22.387 --> 01:00:25.755
- I did
 actually, you inspired me.

01:00:40.138 --> 01:00:41.337
      - I never would
      have thought of this

01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:42.805
       fireplace in here.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.941
    It was all just storage,
    but it's perfect.

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:48.911
       Seems like it will
       work year round?

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.712
            - Yeah.

01:00:51.282 --> 01:00:52.014
           - Hannah.

01:00:53.618 --> 01:00:56.218
- I want you to be happy, I do,

01:00:56.254 --> 01:00:58.921
 but I think we can do better.

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:01.257
        - You don't like
        the dining room?

01:01:01.292 --> 01:01:03.292
 - No, I love it, but this room

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:05.895
       is begging for a
       larger chandelier,

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:08.097
      something bold that
      stands on its own.

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:11.267
- So you don't like the sconces?

01:01:11.302 --> 01:01:13.302
      - I should have said
      something earlier.

01:01:13.371 --> 01:01:16.072
      I know you're a big
      fan, but this room

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.307
   is missing the wow factor.

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:20.576
  - Well, you're the designer,

01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:22.211
    so I'll leave you to it.

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:32.655
      - Okay, well, Wally
      is definitely coming

01:01:32.723 --> 01:01:34.256
  to the grand opening, so...

01:01:35.193 --> 01:01:36.826
       Prepare yourself.

01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:38.828
       - I felt better
       five seconds ago.

01:01:45.837 --> 01:01:48.537
    - It's a slippery
    slope, change one thing,

01:01:48.573 --> 01:01:49.905
      make one exception--

01:01:49.974 --> 01:01:52.007
     - Which I totally
     understand, and I know

01:01:52.076 --> 01:01:54.043
      it's easier to keep
      things as they are,

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:56.579
     but this is more than
     just a design thing,

01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:58.180
     it's a communal thing.

01:01:58.216 --> 01:02:00.616
     The benefit this
     space could afford us,

01:02:00.651 --> 01:02:02.818
      to me, far outweighs
      the exception

01:02:02.854 --> 01:02:03.953
         for a pergola.

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:06.589
      - With a completely
      different look

01:02:06.624 --> 01:02:08.557
 and feel to the original home.

01:02:08.593 --> 01:02:11.026
      - Larry, maintaining
      the integrity

01:02:11.062 --> 01:02:12.628
 of the buildings in this town

01:02:12.663 --> 01:02:15.097
  is a huge priority of mine,

01:02:15.133 --> 01:02:17.366
 it's the reason why I'm here.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.369
      - And I'll admit, I
      had forgotten just

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.438
how beautiful the buildings are.

01:02:22.507 --> 01:02:24.540
   I mean, look at this one.

01:02:24.609 --> 01:02:28.544
   I don't want to compromise
   any of that richness.

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:31.147
     - I think that we can
     both agree there's

01:02:31.182 --> 01:02:33.883
     a lot of history here.

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:40.756
     But this pergola, as
     designed, it elevates

01:02:41.926 --> 01:02:43.726
     the building and helps
     fulfill its purpose

01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:46.629
      in a new previously
      unimagined way.

01:02:46.664 --> 01:02:50.032
    Look, I have to agree
    with Hannah on this one.

01:02:51.302 --> 01:02:53.002
- And if you knew the two of us,

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:54.103
      that's saying a lot.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.207
- Okay, well, I'll mull it over

01:02:58.276 --> 01:02:59.241
      and get back to you.

01:02:59.277 --> 01:03:00.543
            - Soon?

01:03:00.578 --> 01:03:03.012
    - It's gonna have to be.

01:03:03.047 --> 01:03:04.480
- You're so persuasive.

01:03:04.515 --> 01:03:05.748
       - It was teamwork.

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:07.216
      But I wouldn't get
      too excited, I mean,

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:08.851
 he hasn't agreed to anything.

01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:10.085
             - Yet.

01:03:10.154 --> 01:03:11.987
      - I am feeling
      pretty good though.

01:03:12.023 --> 01:03:14.456
   - You should, it's all
   starting to come together.

01:03:14.492 --> 01:03:16.392
      - I love this phase.

01:03:16.427 --> 01:03:18.527
     - Well, you know what?

01:03:18.596 --> 01:03:21.397
       I think we should
       go sightseeing.

01:03:21.432 --> 01:03:22.431
       - In our hometown?

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.066
   - Yeah, why not tomorrow?

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:27.870
       - Well, I actually
       have to go look

01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:29.672
       at tiles tomorrow
       in the morning.

01:03:29.707 --> 01:03:30.873
           - Perfect.

01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:32.107
   We'll go in the afternoon,
   it's the weekend.

01:03:32.143 --> 01:03:36.979
     - Jeff, you know that
     I'm leaving soon.

01:03:38.182 --> 01:03:39.114
       - Which makes you
       kind of a tourist

01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:42.117
     who should definitely
     go on a tour.

01:03:44.622 --> 01:03:45.788
         - I'd love to.

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:49.992
    - All right, well then,
    maybe we should just

01:03:50.027 --> 01:03:52.194
        see how it goes.

01:03:57.068 --> 01:03:58.033
            Come on.

01:04:04.075 --> 01:04:06.609
   - I can't believe I never
   did this walk before.

01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:07.910
  All the years I lived here.

01:04:09.647 --> 01:04:10.346
 I think I just thought it was

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:11.880
    something tourists did.

01:04:11.916 --> 01:04:14.516
     - Well, my parents
     started taking me here

01:04:14.552 --> 01:04:16.018
       when I was three.

01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:19.455
  Didn't have much say in it,
  but it still impresses me.

01:04:20.358 --> 01:04:21.190
          - The style?

01:04:21.225 --> 01:04:23.125
- Just how unique everything is.

01:04:24.362 --> 01:04:27.329
      The detail, it's not
      just a picket fence

01:04:27.365 --> 01:04:28.631
   and another picket fence.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.433
Everything is done specifically.

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:33.369
      To last a lifetime.

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:37.172
- This place really is special.

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:38.140
     - See, I told you so.

01:04:41.379 --> 01:04:43.012
    I do like it better
    when you're here though.

01:04:43.047 --> 01:04:45.314
           - Smooth.

01:04:45.383 --> 01:04:46.282
         - I'm serious.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.654
    - Okay, Mr. Tour Guide.

01:04:51.722 --> 01:04:53.789
      How about that one?

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.094
  - That one was built in 1872

01:05:00.197 --> 01:05:03.065
    by a local sheep farmer
    for his daughter.

01:05:03.134 --> 01:05:04.033
 And she ended up living there

01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:05.334
   for the rest of her life.

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:08.170
    - I didn't think I liked
    tudor style houses,

01:05:08.205 --> 01:05:10.806
    but that is incredible.

01:05:11.942 --> 01:05:13.142
    - Yeah, it is, isn't it?

01:05:25.823 --> 01:05:27.289
       - Ready to start?

01:05:27.358 --> 01:05:28.590
          - Yes I am.

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:29.358
            Thanks.

01:05:29.393 --> 01:05:30.359
            - Great.

01:05:30.428 --> 01:05:31.794
             - Hey.

01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:32.728
             - hey.

01:05:32.763 --> 01:05:36.632
 - Um, so I am kind of shocked

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:37.633
     that it went this way.

01:05:38.836 --> 01:05:39.601
             - Why?

01:05:41.072 --> 01:05:42.805
Oh, please say they approved it.

01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:44.506
          - I'm sorry.

01:05:47.211 --> 01:05:48.010
         - That's okay.

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:49.812
- It just looks like we're gonna

01:05:49.847 --> 01:05:51.246
  have a lot more work to do.

01:05:52.717 --> 01:05:53.582
       {Hannah stammers)

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:55.517
   Oh yeah, they approved it.

01:05:58.322 --> 01:06:00.389
      - Looks like we have
      a pergola to build.

01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:01.190
          - All right.

01:06:01.225 --> 01:06:02.024
          - Way to go.

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:02.891

      Growing up, it was
      your dad's favorite,

01:09:35.706 --> 01:09:38.607
   and you would always
   sneak into the living room

01:09:38.642 --> 01:09:42.444
     way past your bedtime
     whenever it was on.

01:09:42.513 --> 01:09:44.645

01:09:44.682 --> 01:09:46.915

      - I can't believe I
      forgot about that.

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:55.791

            - Yeah.

01:10:01.098 --> 01:10:04.566
    Well, you pulled it off.

01:10:06.971 --> 01:10:09.671
 And had a little fun doing it.

01:10:10.741 --> 01:10:15.444
- Mom, be honest, is this crazy?

01:10:15.479 --> 01:10:16.244
             Again?

01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:20.682
       - You know, it is
       a wonderful thing

01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:24.086
     when someone gets you,
     and it is even better

01:10:24.154 --> 01:10:26.421
  when they challenge you too.

01:10:26.457 --> 01:10:28.323
  And it is rare to find both.

01:10:32.363 --> 01:10:34.896
      Oh, and speaking of.

01:11:00.591 --> 01:11:01.323
             - Wow.

01:11:07.331 --> 01:11:08.096
          - Thank you.

01:11:11.168 --> 01:11:13.335
- So, you ready for the reveal?

01:11:23.113 --> 01:11:25.013
     - I have to admit, I
     never thought you two

01:11:25.049 --> 01:11:27.616
    would get past the
    window, but here we are.

01:11:27.651 --> 01:11:29.851
       - Congratulations,
       it looks great.

01:11:29.887 --> 01:11:30.719
          - Thank you.

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:32.154
- I had to give up the sconces,

01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:34.189
      but I am very happy.

01:11:34.258 --> 01:11:35.323
            Cheers.

01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:38.493
- Cheers.

01:11:41.632 --> 01:11:43.565
  - You told me you would
  help prep for the interview.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.167
  - Oh, let's step over here.

01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:47.202
        - Be right back.

01:11:47.271 --> 01:11:49.304
       - Yeah, of course.

01:11:49.373 --> 01:11:52.374
       - Jeff, I wanted
       to thank you too.

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:53.875
You brought a lot to the table.

01:11:53.911 --> 01:11:56.211
     - Oh, no, it was fun.

01:11:56.246 --> 01:11:59.214
     The very beginning
     wasn't that much fun.

01:12:00.851 --> 01:12:01.817
      - You know, she's a
      real star, Hannah.

01:12:01.885 --> 01:12:02.918
  - Yeah, she always has been.

01:12:02.953 --> 01:12:03.952
  - And if the viewers love it

01:12:04.021 --> 01:12:05.153
       as much as we do,
       there's no telling

01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:06.121
      where this will go.

01:12:06.156 --> 01:12:07.589
        - I'm sorry, go?

01:12:07.624 --> 01:12:10.058
       - The new format
       is really working.

01:12:10.094 --> 01:12:11.560
       We're just taking
       the time to get

01:12:11.595 --> 01:12:13.862
     to know the place,
     the people, so we want

01:12:13.931 --> 01:12:16.398
 to keep the show on
 location, different locations

01:12:16.433 --> 01:12:17.566
       across the states.

01:12:17.601 --> 01:12:19.034
As long as Hannah is up for it.

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:22.003
Too bad we'll have to find other

01:12:22.072 --> 01:12:23.538
      consultants though.

01:12:23.574 --> 01:12:25.540
   We can't afford to travel
   everyone, of course.

01:12:25.576 --> 01:12:26.842
   You guys were a good team.

01:12:26.877 --> 01:12:30.112
 - Yeah, yeah, that's a shame.

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:32.047
          - Excuse me.

01:12:32.082 --> 01:12:32.848
          - Of course.

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:38.587
     - Can you believe it?

01:12:38.655 --> 01:12:40.122
       One quick sign off
       and we're done.

01:12:40.157 --> 01:12:41.823
     - We just really need
     you to up the energy.

01:12:41.892 --> 01:12:42.624
           - Energy?

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:43.625
       - For the closing.

01:12:43.694 --> 01:12:45.227
    Add a little more jazz.

01:12:45.262 --> 01:12:47.329
       But not too much.

01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:48.130
            - Jazz?

01:12:51.001 --> 01:12:52.701
We're rolling.

01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:03.445
    - I'm sorry, just a sec.

01:13:04.915 --> 01:13:06.448
              Hey.

01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:07.349
       - Everything okay?

01:13:07.384 --> 01:13:08.517
  - Yeah, just a quick thing.

01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:10.352
      I am super grateful
      for this job,

01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:13.455
      I am, I'm also smart
      and hard working,

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:16.391
      and kind of funny,
      but not on command.

01:13:16.426 --> 01:13:18.560
     I can't keep changing
     who I am and doubting

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:20.629
      what I'm doing, so
      I'm just gonna be me

01:13:20.664 --> 01:13:22.097
       from here on out.

01:13:22.132 --> 01:13:25.200
    You hired me, and if
    that's not what you want

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:27.803
        anymore, sorry.

01:13:31.275 --> 01:13:32.574
   - Guess she can go rogue.

01:13:36.747 --> 01:13:38.647
    - It's been a wild five
    weeks in my hometown

01:13:38.682 --> 01:13:40.115
         of Lewisburg.

01:13:46.290 --> 01:13:48.890
   - I can't believe you
   have to fly out so early.

01:13:48.926 --> 01:13:51.259
     - You are not getting
     up to drive me.

01:13:51.295 --> 01:13:53.328
- I know, I know, I just thought

01:13:53.363 --> 01:13:55.163
 we'd have a little more time.

01:13:55.199 --> 01:13:56.231
           - Me too.

01:13:57.434 --> 01:13:59.868
     But I promise I'll
     come back again soon.

01:14:01.338 --> 01:14:06.208
  Maybe next time, you'll let
  me update that sun room.

01:14:06.944 --> 01:14:07.943
          If you want.

01:14:07.978 --> 01:14:10.111
      - We would love it.

01:14:10.147 --> 01:14:10.912
             - Yes.

01:14:12.049 --> 01:14:14.482
  Oh, hey, have you seen Jeff?

01:14:14.518 --> 01:14:16.218
       - Maybe this way.

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:34.336
  - This is either a very
  sweet or a very sad visual,

01:14:34.371 --> 01:14:35.303
        I can't decide.

01:14:36.607 --> 01:14:37.772
    Looking for an opponent?

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:40.709
     - I thought you were
     inside doing a thing.

01:14:42.446 --> 01:14:46.982
       - I was actually,
       doing my thing.

01:14:47.885 --> 01:14:49.517
       I'm not sure what
       it's gonna mean,

01:14:49.553 --> 01:14:51.419
      but I felt so good.

01:14:51.455 --> 01:14:53.255
     I told Wally, I'm
     just gonna be myself,

01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:54.556
 and if they don't want that--

01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:55.957
 - Oh, they're gonna want that.

01:14:58.128 --> 01:14:59.494
       - How do you know?

01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:01.496
   - Because, you're amazing.

01:15:05.202 --> 01:15:06.468
          - You okay?

01:15:06.503 --> 01:15:07.969
  - Yeah, it's just, you know.

01:15:09.306 --> 01:15:11.139
     I'm bummed that
     you're going tomorrow.

01:15:13.377 --> 01:15:15.043
           - Me too.

01:15:15.112 --> 01:15:18.713
      Well, luckily you're
      just a flight away.

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:22.450
      - Yeah, I should let
      you get back to it.

01:15:24.755 --> 01:15:25.687
       - What's going on?

01:15:27.124 --> 01:15:31.026
    - Nothing, I just know
    that your life is there

01:15:31.061 --> 01:15:33.061
       and mine is here.

01:15:36.767 --> 01:15:38.533
     - Are you kidding me?

01:15:38.568 --> 01:15:39.935
            - What?

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:43.905
      - I thought that we
      were just gonna see.

01:15:43.941 --> 01:15:46.174
   Isn't that what you said?

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:48.376
   - That's what I want, but
   it doesn't make sense.

01:15:50.247 --> 01:15:52.047
    - But nothing's changed.

01:15:52.082 --> 01:15:55.016
       - Hannah, the sky
       is always gonna

01:15:55.052 --> 01:15:56.518
     be the limit for you.

01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:58.753
    Who knows where all
    this work is gonna lead.

01:16:04.728 --> 01:16:05.460
            Hannah.

01:16:05.529 --> 01:16:06.728
            - What?

01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:09.297
     You know, we push each
     other all the time,

01:16:09.333 --> 01:16:11.132
      on the small things.

01:16:11.201 --> 01:16:13.702
       We make each other
       so much better,

01:16:13.737 --> 01:16:14.970
      but it's pointless.

01:16:15.806 --> 01:16:18.106
Because when it really matters,

01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:20.542
  you don't want to be pushed
  out of your comfort zone.

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:23.345
- I don't want to hold you back.

01:16:25.749 --> 01:16:27.882
    - I'm not the one you
    should be worried about.

01:16:31.488 --> 01:16:33.388
 - Wait, can we please just...

01:16:38.562 --> 01:16:39.327
            - What?

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:50.739
I have to get back to the party.

01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:55.570
- Yeah, so I think I'll make it

01:17:55.605 --> 01:17:57.105
      a working vacation,
      conference shouldn't

01:17:57.174 --> 01:17:58.306
       take up that much
       time, the girls

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.408
       have been dying to
       snorkel, and uh...

01:18:01.912 --> 01:18:03.912
           You good?

01:18:03.947 --> 01:18:05.046
   You've been pretty quiet.

01:18:05.082 --> 01:18:06.114
            - Yeah.

01:18:07.017 --> 01:18:08.116
           I'm fine.

01:18:09.419 --> 01:18:10.185
         - That's good.

01:18:12.489 --> 01:18:14.589
       You know, LA isn't
       that far away.

01:18:14.624 --> 01:18:15.857
      - Oh, come on, man.

01:18:15.892 --> 01:18:17.826
      - Come on, it's not.

01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:19.861
 - Look, I appreciate it, I do,

01:18:19.930 --> 01:18:23.665
     but she deserves more
     than long distance.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.400
   - I get that, I do, but--

01:18:25.469 --> 01:18:27.569
 - Look, I wish it made sense.

01:18:27.604 --> 01:18:30.171
    I do, but not for
    somebody who's made sure

01:18:30.207 --> 01:18:33.541
  everything in their life
  has been structurally sound.

01:18:36.346 --> 01:18:37.812
            - Right.

01:18:37.848 --> 01:18:38.646
            - Right.

01:18:40.417 --> 01:18:43.451
 - But I'm pretty sure love
 isn't supposed to make sense.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.353
     You can't plan it,
     you can't schedule it.

01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:47.122
      There's always
      gonna be that risk.

01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:48.389
      Plus, you've been in
      love with this girl

01:18:48.425 --> 01:18:50.024
       for as long as I
       can remember, so.

01:18:51.595 --> 01:18:52.360
          - The usual?

01:18:56.299 --> 01:18:57.065
            - What?

01:19:31.902 --> 01:19:32.634
      - I don't know about
      you, but I think

01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:34.035
        it's about time.

01:19:34.104 --> 01:19:34.802
             - For?

01:19:34.838 --> 01:19:35.870
    - Unpacking those boxes.

01:19:38.842 --> 01:19:41.242
    - Well, right now, I'm
    finishing up with this.

01:19:42.145 --> 01:19:43.678
  - Well, we got another call,

01:19:43.713 --> 01:19:45.246
a building they want to convert,

01:19:45.315 --> 01:19:48.249
   and since you did so well
   on this last project...

01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:52.086
I know this is maybe not exactly

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:52.987
       what you pictured.

01:19:53.023 --> 01:19:55.590

  for the rest of the season?

01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:08.570
     - But keep him happy.

01:20:08.605 --> 01:20:10.038
        You know Wally.

01:20:10.073 --> 01:20:11.606
        - I'll take it.

01:20:11.675 --> 01:20:13.808
       - Wait, are you
       seriously working

01:20:13.843 --> 01:20:14.909
        on your day off?

01:20:14.945 --> 01:20:16.978
 - Well, I finished my balcony,

01:20:17.047 --> 01:20:20.548
     something I've been
     wanting to do forever.

01:20:20.617 --> 01:20:22.383
   - Try to relax too, okay?

01:20:22.419 --> 01:20:23.785
     - I'm basically done.

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:25.987
     I ordered my favorite
     food delivery.

01:20:26.022 --> 01:20:27.288
            - Good.

01:20:27.324 --> 01:20:28.489
    We'll rev it up tomorrow
    and talk new locations.

01:20:28.525 --> 01:20:29.958
           - You bet.

01:20:29.993 --> 01:20:31.559
     - You doing all right?

01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:34.529
        - I'll be good.

01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:36.431
           You know.

01:20:36.466 --> 01:20:37.532
       - You always are.

01:20:55.885 --> 01:20:58.286
    - Hey, yes, Pete, good.

01:20:58.355 --> 01:21:01.422
   Come on up, I'm on the
   balcony, I'll buzz you in.

01:21:01.458 --> 01:21:02.257
            Thanks.

01:21:14.638 --> 01:21:15.470
- Delivery?

01:21:19.142 --> 01:21:23.111
      I guess you weren't
      expecting me.

01:21:23.146 --> 01:21:25.480
   - You can say that again.

01:21:25.515 --> 01:21:27.682
           Jeff, wow.

01:21:33.089 --> 01:21:34.856
    What are you doing here?

01:21:34.924 --> 01:21:36.724
  - I was bringing you these.

01:21:38.094 --> 01:21:40.561
      - And then I, uh,
      fortunately saw your

01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:41.863
   delivery guy at the door.

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:46.734
    - You flew all the way
    here to bring me donuts?

01:21:52.642 --> 01:21:57.145
       - I was hoping we
       could start over,

01:21:57.213 --> 01:21:58.379
    but for real this time.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.182
      I've realized after
      all these years

01:22:01.217 --> 01:22:02.583
   of trying to make it work,

01:22:04.254 --> 01:22:05.853
      we've always worked.

01:22:05.889 --> 01:22:07.689
       I've just been too
       scared to commit

01:22:07.724 --> 01:22:09.190
        to the unknown.

01:22:13.163 --> 01:22:13.895
          Not anymore.

01:22:15.432 --> 01:22:17.465
       Wherever you go,
       whatever it takes,

01:22:18.535 --> 01:22:19.734
     I want to be with you.

01:22:19.769 --> 01:22:21.869
    I think we make a pretty
    great team together.

01:22:23.807 --> 01:22:27.241
       I think we could
       be great anywhere.

01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:31.713
      - You really want to
      see where this goes?

01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:34.515
   - Yeah, if you'll let me.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.119
    - How long are you here?

01:22:39.422 --> 01:22:43.324
      - Well, it's sort
      of to be determined.

01:22:43.393 --> 01:22:45.426
      Kind of stepping out
      of my comfort zone

01:22:45.462 --> 01:22:46.394
       a little bit here.

01:22:46.429 --> 01:22:47.795
   - It's a good look on you.

01:22:48.865 --> 01:22:49.664
        - You think so?

01:22:49.733 --> 01:22:50.498
            - Yeah.

01:22:57.941 --> 01:22:59.841
   - Is that a mustard couch?

01:23:01.344 --> 01:23:02.844
