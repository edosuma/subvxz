01:12.967 --> 01:14.967
MOM LIKES
HOMEMADE STUFF.

01:14.967 --> 01:18.300
I'M SURE BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US, WE CAN
THINK OF SOMETHING.

01:22.033 --> 01:24.667
DON'T HURT YOURSELF.

HEY, RAVEN, YOU OK?

01:58.734 --> 01:59.867

ON YOUR FACE.

01:59.867 --> 02:01.200
NO, I DIDN'T.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.200
YES, YOU DID.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.100
YOU WERE DOING THIS.

02:08.700 --> 02:11.400
I HAVE NEVER MADE
THAT FACE BEFORE
IN MY LIFE.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.300
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.300
OK. LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.767
BUT...OK,
I HAD THIS FEELING

02:18.767 --> 02:22.934
THAT ONE OF YOU IS GOING
TO BE IN TROUBLE.

02:22.934 --> 02:26.600
WELL, TROUBLE FOR US ISN'T
EXACTLY BREAKING NEWS.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.567
WELL, IF YOU HEAR
A BELL OR A SNEEZE...

02:31.567 --> 02:33.400

THANKS FOR TAKING

04:42.500 --> 04:44.300
EXCEPT SHE'S
RICH, FAMOUS,

04:44.300 --> 04:47.100
AND SHE THINKS ALGEBRA
IS A GREEK ISLAND.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.800
WELL, IT'S OK BECAUSE
MY BOSS LOVES HER.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.367
LONDON ALWAYS WEARS
DONNA CABANA'S DESIGNS

04:52.367 --> 04:53.767
AND GETS
IN THE MAGAZINES.

04:53.767 --> 04:57.100
HEY, WHAT
IF LONDON WORE ONE
OF YOUR DESIGNS?

04:57.100 --> 04:59.967
OH, MY GOODNESS.
YOU COULD DO THAT?

05:01.200 --> 05:02.667
SHE WOULD
IF I ASKED HER.

05:02.667 --> 05:03.967
SHE THINKS VERY HIGHLY
OF MY OPINION.

05:03.967 --> 05:05.400
OH, MY GOODNESS!
OH, MY GOODNESS!

05:05.400 --> 05:06.667
MADDIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH!

05:06.667 --> 05:08.033
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

05:08.033 --> 05:11.400
I COULD GET PROMOTED FROM
INTERN TO EXECUTIVE INTERN.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.567
GIRL, I COULD
GET MY OWN PENCIL.

05:13.567 --> 05:15.200

HELPS PEOPLE

05:24.700 --> 05:28.133
OVER A CERTAIN AGE
STAY REGULAR.

05:29.367 --> 05:32.767
I'LL HAVE
YOU KNOW I'M NOWHERE
NEAR A CERTAIN AGE.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.100
IN FACT, SOME
PEOPLE CONSIDER ME
TO BE QUITE YOUNG.

05:35.100 --> 05:38.367
YEAH. PEOPLE WHO
ARE QUITE OLD.

05:38.367 --> 05:41.934
MOM SAYS HAVE KIDS.
THEY'RE A JOY.

05:41.934 --> 05:43.200
YEAH, RIGHT.

05:44.767 --> 05:47.300
HEY, ZACH. DO YOU
BELIEVE IN PREMONITIONS?

05:47.300 --> 05:51.233
NAH. I DON'T
BELIEVE IN ANY WORD
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:51.233 --> 05:54.367
WELL, IT'S JUST FREAKY
HOW RAVEN SEEMS TO KNOW

05:54.367 --> 05:56.000
ABOUT THINGS
BEFORE THEY HAPPEN.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.567
WHAT ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT?

05:57.567 --> 06:00.066
RAVEN SAID SOME CRAZY STUFF
ABOUT BEING CAREFUL

06:00.066 --> 06:02.367
IF YOU HEAR BELLS
AND SNEEZING.

06:02.367 --> 06:06.367
OOH, JUST WATCH OUT
FOR REINDEER WITH HAY FEVER.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.100
I'M NOT OLD.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.033
I'M STILL YOUNG.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.400
ACHOO!

06:16.400 --> 06:17.700

06:19.000 --> 06:20.300
OH, SNAP!

06:20.300 --> 06:21.567
HURRY! WATCH OUT.

06:25.133 --> 06:27.567
WOW. THAT WAS
A CLOSE ONE.

06:27.567 --> 06:29.200
CODY, ARE YOU OK?

06:30.300 --> 06:31.600
YEAH. YEAH.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.300
I'M ALL RIGHT,

06:33.300 --> 06:36.467
BUT MY LIFE JUST FLASHED
BEFORE MY EYES.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.200
BOY, I SPEND A LOT
OF TIME IN THE LIBRARY.

06:45.834 --> 06:48.867
LONDON, EVERY TIME I COME
IN YOUR CLOSET, I GET LOST.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.500
HERE. TAKE A MAP.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.000
WOW.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.300
I GOT TO CHECK OUT
HAT WORLD.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.500
HOW DO I LOOK?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.300
WELL, I LIKE THE TOP.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.300
NOT YOU.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.100
I'M TALKING
TO THE MIRROR.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.100
Mirror: TWO WORDS.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.000
GOR-GEOUS.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.967
DID YOUR MIRROR
JUST TALK?

07:06.967 --> 07:08.133
YEP.

07:08.133 --> 07:10.233
IT'S SOMETHING THAT DADDY'S
SCIENTISTS CAME UP WITH.

07:10.233 --> 07:12.300
NOW NOT ONLY CAN
I SEE HOW GOOD I LOOK,

07:12.300 --> 07:13.767
I CAN HEAR ABOUT IT, TOO.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.233
YAY, MIRROR!

07:15.233 --> 07:17.100
OOH! OOH! LET ME TRY.

07:18.233 --> 07:20.233
SO, HOW DO I LOOK?

07:20.233 --> 07:21.834
Mirror: HA!

07:22.934 --> 07:26.300
MADDIE, CAN YOU MOVE
BEFORE IT CRACKS?

07:26.300 --> 07:27.500
YOU KNOW, LONDON.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.400
THE MIRROR'S RIGHT.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.000
YOU DO LOOK FABULOUS.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.500
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
EVEN LOOK BETTER ON YOU?

07:33.500 --> 07:34.834
THIS.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.767
MY FRIEND RAVEN BAXTER
DESIGNED IT.

07:36.767 --> 07:38.567
NEVER HEARD OF HER.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.934
DO YOU LIKE THE DESIGN?

07:42.934 --> 07:44.100
Mirror: THREE WORDS.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.767
HI-DE-OUS.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.600
SHUT YOUR...

07:48.600 --> 07:51.100
WHATEVER.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.734
LONDON, PLEASE DO ME
THIS FAVOR?

07:52.734 --> 07:54.467
I TOLD RAVEN
YOU'D WEAR IT.

07:54.467 --> 07:55.934
WELL, UNTELL HER.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.834
LOOK, I AM A SOMEBODY
WHO WEARS THINGS MADE
BY OTHER SOMEBODYS.

07:58.834 --> 07:59.900
FINE.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.033
YOUR LOSS.

08:03.767 --> 08:04.800
WRONG WAY.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.934
YOU'RE HEADED TOWARDS
SANDAL LAND.

08:13.033 --> 08:15.934
AAH!

08:15.934 --> 08:17.667
BOY, THAT WAS CLOSE.

08:17.667 --> 08:20.033
I BARELY MADE IT
INTO THE HOTEL ALIVE.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.700
NORMAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.500
THIS PROVES
THAT RAVEN WAS RIGHT.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.600
I HEARD THREE SNEEZES
AND THEN THE ICE CREAM
TRUCK BELL.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.400
NEXT THING I KNEW,
I WAS ALMOST FLATTENED.

08:35.867 --> 08:37.300
FIRST OF ALL,

08:37.300 --> 08:41.667
I WAS THE ONE
WHO SNEEZED JUST
TO FREAK YOU OUT.

08:41.667 --> 08:42.700
THANKS.

08:42.700 --> 08:43.867
IT WORKED.

08:43.867 --> 08:45.367
WAIT A MINUTE.

08:45.367 --> 08:47.400
I'M HAVING A VISION.

08:52.100 --> 08:55.233
IT'S SOMEONE TAKING
YOUR FIVE BUCKS YOU

09:20.367 --> 09:22.934

09:30.934 --> 09:31.900
WELL, IT WILL BE

09:31.900 --> 09:33.000
DON'T TELL HER
WHAT IT IS.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.967

19:41.467 --> 19:42.700
OK. I'M SORRY.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.000
IT'S JUST THAT LONDON
WOULDN'T WEAR ANYTHING

19:45.000 --> 19:46.467
UNLESS IT WAS
A BIG NAME DESIGNER,

19:46.467 --> 19:48.600
SO I SORT
OF SWITCHED LABELS.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.500
AND YOU THOUGHT
THAT WOULD WORK?

19:50.500 --> 19:52.567
WELL, I GAVE IT
A SHOT.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.367
I KNEW HOW MUCH
THIS MEANT TO YOU.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.900
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:55.900 --> 19:59.233
I'M WEARING SOMETHING
MADE BY SOMEONE
WHO'S NOT FAMOUS?

19:59.233 --> 20:01.934
I'VE NEVER DONE
THAT BEFORE.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.100
EVEN MY DIAPERS
WERE DESIGNER.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.700
WELL, AT LEAST MOM
LIKED OUR DANCE.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.467
WELL, AFTER
THE FLOOD, FIRE,

20:09.467 --> 20:10.700
AND A RUNAWAY ROBOT,

20:10.700 --> 20:14.367
SHE WAS JUST
HAPPY TO GET OUT
OF THERE ALIVE.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.600
YOU'RE HANNAH MONTANA.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.200
OH. OOH.
I ALMOST PASSED OUT.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.667
YOU'RE
HANNAH MONTANA.

20:31.667 --> 20:34.100
AND YOU'RE WEARING CAKE.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.200
MMM. VANILLA. MY FAVORITE.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.700
[SQUEAKS]

20:40.700 --> 20:42.000
OH, MY GOODNESS.
OH, MY GOODNESS.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.867

ARIZONA--

20:47.000 --> 20:47.934
MONTANA.

20:47.934 --> 20:49.033
IT'S HANNAH MONTANA!

20:49.033 --> 20:50.600
YES! YES!

20:50.600 --> 20:51.800
[SCREAMING]

20:53.400 --> 20:54.800
HANNAH.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.567
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SINCE YOU SANG AT MY
BIRTHDAY LAST YEAR.

20:57.567 --> 20:59.300
OH, YEAH.
I HAD A BLAST.

20:59.300 --> 21:03.300
BY THE WAY,
Y'ALL STILL HAVEN'T
PAID ME FOR THAT.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.834
WELL, THAT'S HOW
THE RICH STAY RICH.

21:04.834 --> 21:06.200
YOU KNOW IT'S RIGHT.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.567
OH, I LOVE
YOUR DRESS.

21:07.567 --> 21:08.400
THIS THING?

21:08.400 --> 21:09.233
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

21:09.233 --> 21:10.734
OH, THAT'S ME.
THAT'S ME.

21:10.734 --> 21:13.300
RAVEN BAXTER,
I'M LISTED. YOU CAN
LOOK IT UP.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.133
WELL,
I'M HOSTING AN AWARD
SHOW NEXT WEEK.

21:15.133 --> 21:16.800
CAN YOU MAKE ME
ANOTHER ONE?

21:16.800 --> 21:18.667
SORRY. THIS IS
A ONE OF A KIND.

21:18.667 --> 21:20.567
IT WAS MADE FOR ME
AND ONLY ME.

21:20.567 --> 21:22.033
I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT.

21:22.033 --> 21:24.300
A GIRL CAN CHANGE
HER MIND, CAN'T SHE?

21:24.300 --> 21:26.400
WELL, I WANT
A RAVEN ORIGINAL.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.567
LET ME HAVE
A LOOK AT IT.

21:28.567 --> 21:30.667
OH, HOLD ON A SECOND,
MY RING'S CAUGHT TO IT.

21:30.667 --> 21:31.767
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:31.767 --> 21:33.300
HANNAH, LET GO.

21:33.300 --> 21:35.967
LIKE I HAVE A CHOICE.
SERIOUSLY.

21:35.967 --> 21:37.600
OH, MY GOODNESS.
OH, MY GOODNESS.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.467
LONDON TIPTON
AND HANNAH MONTANA

21:39.467 --> 21:41.100
ARE HAVING A CAT
FIGHT OVER MY DRESS.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.200
AAH!

21:42.200 --> 21:43.834
THIS IS THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

21:43.834 --> 21:45.100
[RIP]

21:45.100 --> 21:46.100
YOU RIPPED IT.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.567
NO. YOU RIPPED IT.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.000
OH, NO SHE DIDN'T.

21:55.467 --> 21:57.567
OK. THESE ARE
THE NICEST THINGS I OWN.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.233
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS ONE?

21:59.233 --> 22:01.033
Mirror: EH.

22:01.033 --> 22:02.300
THIS ONE?

22:02.300 --> 22:04.200
I DON'T THINK SO.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.734
YEAH. WELL, THAT FRAME
MAKES YOU LOOK FAT.

22:06.734 --> 22:07.834
UH-HUH.

22:07.834 --> 22:12.233
WELL, I KIND

22:12.233 --> 22:13.367

22:13.367 --> 22:14.567
NO. PSYCHE!

22:14.567 --> 22:15.667
HA HA HA!

22:15.667 --> 22:18.834
YOU KNOW, THE MIRROR
IN HAT WORLD

22:18.834 --> 22:20.233
IS A LOT NICER THAN YOU.

22:20.233 --> 22:21.467
HEY, HONEY.

22:21.467 --> 22:22.734
THE EIGHTIES CALLED.

22:22.734 --> 22:24.700
THEY WANT
THEIR CLOTHES BACK.
