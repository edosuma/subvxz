00:14.570 --> 00:16.695
You're certain it was in the ARC?

00:16.730 --> 00:19.250
We intercepted calls.
The ARC staff were saying

00:19.285 --> 00:21.170
Helen Cutter had it.

00:24.330 --> 00:26.450
So what's happened to it?
We don't know.

00:26.650 --> 00:29.690
It might have been destroyed
in the fire. It might not.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.735
My whole future
could depend on this.

00:31.770 --> 00:34.010
If it's there, I want it back,
understand?

00:35.130 --> 00:37.090
Ma'am.

00:45.290 --> 00:47.250
Ready to begin?

00:51.290 --> 00:53.135
It's amazing.

00:53.170 --> 00:56.210
Once we understand them,
we'll know how to control them.

00:59.890 --> 01:01.850
Get out of there.

01:03.610 --> 01:05.730
Run! Go, go, go!

01:21.610 --> 01:25.090
Does it know I'm here?
Yes, it can sense your heartbeat.

01:25.125 --> 01:27.330
We have to learn
how to harness that power.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.930
Deal with it. It means temporary
suspension of the cloaking device.

01:32.965 --> 01:35.450
The ARC will know...
I'll deal with them later.

02:41.210 --> 02:43.170
'It's on you now.

02:43.410 --> 02:45.370
This matters.

02:46.130 --> 02:48.170
I don't know why.

02:48.205 --> 02:50.130
But it does.

02:50.410 --> 02:52.370
It's on you now. '

02:57.850 --> 02:59.810
Connor...

03:05.330 --> 03:07.375
Let me help you.

03:07.410 --> 03:10.890
I'm an archaeologist, I know how
to deal with things like this.

03:10.925 --> 03:14.010
I can clean it up and see
what lies beneath the dirt.

03:28.850 --> 03:32.210
Listen to me, nobody can find
out about what we're doing here.

03:32.450 --> 03:35.410
Absolutely. Not until we know
what we're dealing with.

03:36.210 --> 03:38.170
Go.

03:51.210 --> 03:54.610
You're in charge until we can
make a permanent appointment.

03:57.090 --> 03:59.010
Are you sure
you want me to take over?

03:59.890 --> 04:01.850
If I wasn't, I wouldn't ask.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.210
Don't expect a pay rise.

04:05.050 --> 04:07.370
I could probably swing you
a parking space.

04:09.570 --> 04:11.890
Keep things calm, controlled,

04:12.250 --> 04:14.690
and if you can manage it,
slightly dull.

04:40.410 --> 04:43.650
Is it working?
No, not yet.

04:45.170 --> 04:47.130
But it will be.

04:48.010 --> 04:50.775
Excuse me.
You need to get some rest.

04:50.810 --> 04:53.050
What I need to do is finish this
and then...

04:54.410 --> 04:56.370
Then I need to fix the detector.

05:03.810 --> 05:06.095
This is the Anomaly Locking
Mechanism.

05:06.130 --> 05:08.490
If I can...
If I can get this to work Abby,

05:08.525 --> 05:10.535
we can seal anomalies.

05:10.570 --> 05:14.010
If we don't know where they are
then it won't be much use, will it?

05:15.050 --> 05:17.010
Fine.

05:22.570 --> 05:24.615
You're driving them too hard.

05:24.650 --> 05:26.770
Right now,
work is the best thing for us.

06:01.290 --> 06:03.250
Any luck?

06:03.410 --> 06:05.455
It's too soon to say.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.930
Once it's clean, we should have
a better idea.

06:10.610 --> 06:12.850
Any chance of putting this back
together?

06:13.250 --> 06:15.295
Wouldn't know where to start.

06:15.330 --> 06:18.290
Give me a few years, I might
be able to work some of it out.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.450
Cutter kept a lot of things
to himself.

06:22.330 --> 06:24.290
Tell me about it.

06:26.170 --> 06:30.610
Hey Jenny, if you ever need
to talk about anything...

06:30.850 --> 06:32.810
There's nothing to say.

06:44.370 --> 06:47.010
Is this a test?
No, this is genuine.

06:48.890 --> 06:50.790
Do we have a location?
Ah-ha.

06:50.825 --> 06:52.690
I'm getting the co-ordinates now.

06:54.530 --> 06:56.490
OK.

06:57.210 --> 06:59.170
It's a go.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.370
OK, let's go then.

07:08.530 --> 07:10.415
Jenny...

07:10.450 --> 07:13.170
It's... it's nearly ready.
Next time. Let's move.

07:17.730 --> 07:19.690
Ma'am...

07:20.290 --> 07:22.535
The cloaking device is going
back on now.

07:22.570 --> 07:25.690
The ARC will have picked up
the signal. Get your men ready.

07:59.490 --> 08:01.450
In there.

08:23.050 --> 08:25.010
Hello?

08:32.850 --> 08:34.809
It's deserted.

08:37.409 --> 08:39.370
It could be in there somewhere.

08:49.010 --> 08:50.970
There must be another way in.

08:56.490 --> 08:58.450
Wait, Jenny.

09:05.050 --> 09:07.190
Captain Wilder?
Becker.

09:07.225 --> 09:09.330
You two know each other?

09:09.690 --> 09:12.430
Sandhurst. Top of his class,
one of my best cadets.

09:12.465 --> 09:15.135
If you two are going to hug,
can you do it later,

09:15.170 --> 09:18.210
cos there's an anomaly in here.
Move back into the foyer.

09:19.090 --> 09:21.050
What's going on here?

09:53.990 --> 09:56.550
You must be Jenny Lewis.
I'm Christine Johnson.

09:57.070 --> 09:59.030
Nice to meet you.

10:00.270 --> 10:02.275
What is this place?
Jenny...

10:02.310 --> 10:06.150
This definitely detected an anomaly
less than 100 feet away from here.

10:06.750 --> 10:09.070
I know that might not mean
anything to you,

10:09.105 --> 10:11.075
but trust me, not a good thing.

10:11.110 --> 10:14.630
There's really nothing to worry
about. There's no anomaly here.

10:14.870 --> 10:16.915
What do you know about
the anomalies?

10:16.950 --> 10:20.270
Let's just have a look,
you know, just to be sure.

10:20.305 --> 10:22.155
I can assure you
you'd find nothing.

10:22.190 --> 10:25.470
I want unrestricted access to
the whole place and an explanation

10:25.505 --> 10:28.315
of why you're here.
I'm afraid that's not possible.

10:28.350 --> 10:31.590
I can make it happen with one phone
call, so let's save time.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.550
James Lester has no authority here.

10:35.350 --> 10:37.355
Now I suggest you go back
to the ARC

10:37.390 --> 10:40.830
and do what it is you all do best.
Did you hear what we just said?

10:40.865 --> 10:43.870
You could be in danger,
just let us go in and have a look.

10:43.905 --> 10:46.510
That's very thoughtful,
but we'll be quite safe.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.710
Do give my regards to James.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.795
Captain Becker, isn't it?

10:55.830 --> 10:58.950
I gather you and Captain Wilder
are old colleagues.

11:00.390 --> 11:02.790
Yes, Ma'am.
Perhaps you'll have the chance

11:02.825 --> 11:04.750
to work together again some day.

11:16.430 --> 11:18.390
Oh God! The car...

11:25.270 --> 11:27.155
Damn it!

11:27.190 --> 11:30.710
She seemed to know all about us
and the anomalies.

11:34.070 --> 11:36.030
That's not news to you, is it?

11:37.630 --> 11:39.830
Are you sure the detector
was working?

11:39.865 --> 11:42.030
We got the same reading
from the handheld.

11:42.065 --> 11:43.995
But you can't be certain?

11:44.030 --> 11:46.590
Well no, but if it wasn't
an anomaly, what was it?

11:46.625 --> 11:48.550
Did you know this place existed?

11:50.190 --> 11:52.875
No.
Right.

11:52.910 --> 11:55.515
Then we need to find out
what they're doing there.

11:55.550 --> 11:58.870
Yes! Thank you for that statement
of the blindingly obvious!

12:01.230 --> 12:03.190
Right, yeah, leave it with me.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.350
Go on, thank you.

12:24.030 --> 12:26.430
Abby's phone, hello?
'Is Abby there?'

12:26.870 --> 12:29.950
No, she's, she's not at the minute,
can I take a message?

12:29.985 --> 12:32.755
'Tell her I'm going to show her
a proper good time. '

12:32.790 --> 12:36.230
Excuse me? 'I'm back and we're
going out on the town tonight. '

12:36.265 --> 12:38.230
Who is this?
'Jack. '

12:38.265 --> 12:40.195
Jack who?

12:40.230 --> 12:42.190
'Got to go, mate. '

12:43.830 --> 12:45.790
Hello?

13:11.990 --> 13:14.630
What is it?
Some kind of detector.

13:14.665 --> 13:16.550
For what?
No idea.

13:16.585 --> 13:18.510
Oh, incisive!

13:18.750 --> 13:21.930
Well, I'm sure it's something
to do with the creatures.

13:21.965 --> 13:25.017
Mick, you realise you're sounding
a little mad? I know.

13:25.052 --> 13:28.035
I don't employ mad people.
What are you talking about?

13:28.070 --> 13:31.950
Half your journalists are mad. They
don't file stories on dinosaurs.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.707
It's beeping, what does that mean?

13:34.742 --> 13:37.430
I think it means we're on our way.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.910
Get me a camera crew ready
in two minutes.

13:42.550 --> 13:45.155
Is it the same place?

13:45.190 --> 13:47.150
No. No, this is a new one.

13:48.190 --> 13:50.750
OK, let's get going then.

13:50.785 --> 13:52.755
Where's Abby?

13:52.790 --> 13:54.930
She said she had to meet someone.

13:54.965 --> 13:57.070
Who?
I don't know, Jack somebody.

13:57.105 --> 13:59.030
We'll call her on the way.

14:01.230 --> 14:03.435
Jenny, give me two minutes.

14:03.470 --> 14:06.030
Two minutes I can have this thing
up and running.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.470
Please.

14:09.430 --> 14:11.350
Two minutes.
Yes!

14:42.310 --> 14:44.430
What is it?
I don't know.

14:45.550 --> 14:47.470
But I think we're going
to find out.

14:52.190 --> 14:54.310
Connor, how much longer?

14:54.345 --> 14:56.270
Seconds away.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.275
Done. You can load it up.

15:02.310 --> 15:04.750
This is actually going to work?
It'll work.

15:04.785 --> 15:06.755
I know this is going to work,
it's...

15:06.790 --> 15:09.390
I hope it's going to work.
It's OK, just asking.

15:09.425 --> 15:11.350
Becker, we'll see you there.

15:30.350 --> 15:32.390
OK, so what do you want me to do?

15:32.425 --> 15:34.350
Depends on what happens.

15:34.910 --> 15:36.870
Who do I speak to about my expenses?

15:39.910 --> 15:41.870
What was that?

15:55.550 --> 15:57.515
Where to now?

15:57.550 --> 15:59.510
Straight ahead, about half a mile.

16:01.590 --> 16:03.595
Did she say anything else?
Who?

16:03.630 --> 16:07.350
Abby. About this Jack guy
and who he was exactly?

16:07.590 --> 16:10.030
No she didn't. I thought
you were calling her?

16:10.065 --> 16:11.990
I tried calling her, but...

16:18.590 --> 16:21.550
What the hell do you think
you're playing at?! You OK?

16:21.585 --> 16:24.110
Please, you've got to come quickly.
What is it?

16:24.145 --> 16:26.515
There's this thing,
a big shining light.

16:26.550 --> 16:29.670
This creature came through
and it started... Stay there.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.550
How much tranquilliser
do you think we need?

16:35.110 --> 16:37.190
This thing, how big was it?

16:37.225 --> 16:39.070
Big.
Your call.

16:47.070 --> 16:50.030
It's in there. Better hurry,
it's really frightening.

16:54.390 --> 16:56.590
I told you to stay away from this.
I know.

16:56.625 --> 16:58.550
I wish I'd listened to you.

17:00.670 --> 17:02.630
Stay there.

17:08.990 --> 17:11.430
You OK?
I'm fine.

17:13.910 --> 17:16.270
I'll go first.
No, me.

17:19.990 --> 17:21.950
How about we both go together?

17:22.310 --> 17:24.230
OK.
On three?

17:24.430 --> 17:26.390
OK.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.590
One...

17:29.230 --> 17:31.190
Two...

17:31.990 --> 17:33.950
Three.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.710
No! No no no no no...

18:07.590 --> 18:10.190
Open the door!
What do you think you're doing?!

18:10.225 --> 18:12.150
Thanks for the scoop, Jenny!

18:13.550 --> 18:15.510
Damn it!

18:15.830 --> 18:17.790
Great!

18:24.150 --> 18:26.470
Has it done anything else yet?
No.

18:27.870 --> 18:30.630
This better be good.
Well, what about that thing?

18:30.665 --> 18:33.115
You promised me a prehistoric
creature.

18:33.150 --> 18:36.030
Now anything less then a mammoth,
you're fired.

18:43.030 --> 18:45.075
No.

18:45.110 --> 18:47.115
No back door.
Oh God!

18:47.150 --> 18:49.275
I can't believe
I let myself get taken in

18:49.310 --> 18:52.550
by that reptile of a journalist!
He's pretty good though.

18:52.585 --> 18:55.270
As reptile journalists go,
he had me.

18:56.470 --> 18:58.430
Becker, how far away are you?

18:59.630 --> 19:02.590
Well look, I don't care how many
barriers you go through

19:02.625 --> 19:04.550
I need you here faster than fast.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.710
They're stuck in road works.

19:10.990 --> 19:12.970
What are you doing?
Door's solid.

19:13.005 --> 19:14.950
We're not getting through there.

19:20.350 --> 19:22.750
This is unbelievable.

19:26.030 --> 19:27.990
Hello there.

19:28.470 --> 19:30.590
Isn't this extraordinary?

19:30.625 --> 19:32.550
Look at this.

19:32.990 --> 19:35.030
What is it? Tell us what it is.

19:35.065 --> 19:37.075
It's a Velociraptor.

19:37.110 --> 19:39.195
A young one, from the late
cretaceous.

19:39.230 --> 19:42.370
This little fellow
is about 80 million years old

19:42.405 --> 19:45.510
and when it's full grown,
these are top predators.

19:45.545 --> 19:47.435
It's a little nervous.

19:47.470 --> 19:49.590
Do you know,
if I could pat a dinosaur...

19:50.310 --> 19:53.910
Hello there.
Come on little fellow, come on.

19:57.350 --> 19:59.870
Wow! That was unbelievable!

19:59.905 --> 20:02.390
Somebody pinch me. Huh!

20:29.190 --> 20:31.150
Keep on filming!

20:32.230 --> 20:34.190
Don't you dare run away!

21:21.550 --> 21:23.910
Danny Quinn?
Oh, you don't want to do that.

21:25.590 --> 21:27.510
You need all the help you can get.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.885
It's over there.
What are you doing here?

21:40.920 --> 21:44.080
Saving your bacon. How did
you even know where we were?

21:44.115 --> 21:46.125
I followed the journalist.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.765
You know he broke into your car?
I gathered that.

21:48.800 --> 21:52.680
Thanks for the help but just go now.
But it's just getting interesting.

21:52.715 --> 21:55.125
If you don't go now,
I'll have you arrested.

21:55.160 --> 21:58.165
Guys, as fun as this is,
we've got more pressing matters.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.800
Give me the gun. I'll go in first.
One more step and I will shoot you.

22:01.835 --> 22:03.760
All right. Absolutely.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.200
That is...

22:30.120 --> 22:32.040
It's enormous, isn't it?
Whew!

22:35.520 --> 22:37.845
You're not going, are you?

22:37.880 --> 22:40.920
Help, you've got to get me
out of here, please!

22:40.955 --> 22:42.925
Help!
Hello?

22:42.960 --> 22:46.160
Please get me out. Door's jammed,
get round the other side.

22:46.195 --> 22:48.120
Oi, I give the orders around here.

22:48.155 --> 22:50.080
Connor, round the other side.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.960
OK, keep your head still.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.160
I've got the door open. Try to stay
calm, we'll get you out as soon as we can.

22:59.195 --> 23:01.160
Just get us out of here, please!

23:02.680 --> 23:05.720
OK, listen, I need you to try
and edge your way towards me.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.600
Yes, that's right, nearly there.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.925
Can I help you?
Get me Christine Johnson.

23:20.960 --> 23:25.400
I don't care if she's in a meeting, on holiday
or struck by lightning. Get her for me now!

23:25.435 --> 23:27.400
Just bring it in here.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.240
Listen, try not to break it
as you unpack it, OK?

23:34.275 --> 23:36.280
Can you describe
the creature to me?

23:36.315 --> 23:38.245
Big.
It's very big, it's huge.

23:38.280 --> 23:41.080
I want more detail.
People are dead because of you.

23:41.115 --> 23:43.165
But this is amazing.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.645
This is the biggest story ever
and it's mine!

23:45.680 --> 23:48.485
You don't seriously believe
you can cover this up?

23:48.520 --> 23:51.600
There'll be no story, trust me.
Guys, can we just focus?

23:51.635 --> 23:54.045
What happened to the creature?
It went back.

23:54.080 --> 23:57.560
You can't stop me from telling
the world about this. Watch me.

23:57.595 --> 24:01.040
Take them away, take their phones,
not one word of this leaks out.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.280
This is unbelievable!
We haven't got much time.

24:05.315 --> 24:07.960
It'll be back.
He knows there's easy prey here.

24:07.995 --> 24:10.045
Look, here's what
I think we should do.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.720
There is no 'we'. This has
got nothing to do with you.

24:13.755 --> 24:15.765
This is a secure zone

24:15.800 --> 24:19.520
and you don't have authorisation
to even be here. Leave now!

24:19.555 --> 24:21.680
Do you want me to arrest him?
Last chance.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.840
So... where do you want
all this stuff? Over there?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.960
Unbelievable.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.600
That's the last one.

24:36.440 --> 24:39.920
Nothing here threatens
the integrity of the ARC operation.

24:39.955 --> 24:42.285
I give you my word on that.
And the Minister's.

24:42.320 --> 24:45.280
Do you know, I can't tell you
how much that reassures me.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.240
You've got a little bit
of a hotline

24:48.275 --> 24:50.245
to the Minister, haven't you?

24:50.280 --> 24:52.960
I saw your suggestions
for Cutter's replacement.

24:52.995 --> 24:55.125
One thing in common,
military uniforms.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.400
Have you got a little bit
of a thing for them?

24:59.080 --> 25:02.540
We're all on the same side, James.
We have to trust each other.

25:02.575 --> 25:05.965
No, I don't think either of us got
where we are by trusting anyone.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.960
The military have a big role to play
in the fight against the anomalies.

25:09.995 --> 25:13.517
I'm sure you appreciate that.
You're getting nowhere near ARC.

25:13.552 --> 25:17.040
You want to trust me on something?
Trust me on that... Christine.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.480
Bear with me.
OK.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.440
And we are ready.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.000
OK. Do this for me.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.120
Connor!

25:56.680 --> 25:58.640
Connor...

25:59.320 --> 26:02.100
I thought you said this was
going to work? It does.

26:02.135 --> 26:04.880
It will. Well, how long
before we can try it again?

26:04.915 --> 26:07.097
I don't know,
a few seconds, I don't know.

26:07.132 --> 26:09.245
It's just a little thing,
but did anyone

26:09.280 --> 26:12.280
think about closing the doors?
That's it, arrest him.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.000
Look out!

26:35.720 --> 26:38.360
Our exclusive is heading
towards the runway.

26:38.395 --> 26:40.320
I need to get out of here.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.485
The biker, he's gone.

26:45.520 --> 26:49.480
His name's Danny Quinn. I'm more concerned
about a T Rex wild on an airfield.

26:49.515 --> 26:52.325
That wasn't a T Rex.
That was a giganotasaurus.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.240
A G Rex, if you like. That thing
is bigger, it's faster.

26:56.275 --> 26:58.285
It's... even more dangerous.

26:58.320 --> 27:01.520
Get the locking mechanism
working and seal that anomaly.

27:01.555 --> 27:04.040
Stay with him.
Anything comes through, kill it.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.600
Come on!

27:20.040 --> 27:23.000
OK, let's get this thing unloaded.
I tee off in an hour.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.920
Bring these four first,
these are the heavy ones.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.760
All right, lads...

27:56.440 --> 27:58.400
Come and have a look at this!

28:08.880 --> 28:11.480
Get back, get back inside the plane!

28:11.515 --> 28:13.440
Quick, get back in!

28:26.160 --> 28:28.760
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.840
Stay under the plane.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.200
I'll go and check on the crew,
I've got to get them down.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.480
What is that thing?
It doesn't matter.

29:05.515 --> 29:07.680
Don't worry,
we'll get you out of here.

29:13.640 --> 29:15.600
Come on. Come on...

29:17.160 --> 29:19.200
Get out!

29:19.235 --> 29:21.205
Come on!

29:21.240 --> 29:25.160
Get out of the car!

29:26.160 --> 29:28.560
Get out! Get out of the car!

29:43.800 --> 29:45.800
Let's turn and burn.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.800
Change of plan. You stay here,

30:06.480 --> 30:08.440
You'll be safer where you are.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.760
My shoulder hurts, you take over.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.280
If I don't get this story first,
I'll sue the government

30:25.315 --> 30:28.440
for theft, false imprisonment,
infringement of copyright

30:28.475 --> 30:31.080
and anything else that
the lawyers can think of.

30:31.115 --> 30:33.085
Why have you stopped?

30:33.120 --> 30:35.240
I want 20 per cent
of the merchandising.

30:38.120 --> 30:40.080
10.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.480
All right, 20.
Just get us out of here.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.565
Yes!

31:15.600 --> 31:17.560
Oh, thank you!

31:19.120 --> 31:21.245
It works.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.200
Never doubted you for a second.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.120
Where have you been?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.005
Connor...

31:38.040 --> 31:40.000
Connor, we need some help.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.800
OK. Stay here, don't touch anything.

31:54.760 --> 31:57.440
Jenny, we'll be with you in seconds.
Just hang on.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.280
Pull over here. By the tow truck.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.840
See you in a bit.

32:29.960 --> 32:31.920
Come on, girl.

32:36.360 --> 32:39.200
Abby, what the hell is he doing?

32:39.235 --> 32:41.160
He's creating a diversion.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.160
No, no no no no no!

33:07.160 --> 33:09.120
I'm not going to out-run this thing!

33:11.600 --> 33:13.560
Just stop!

33:37.520 --> 33:39.480
Connor...

33:58.720 --> 34:00.680
Just don't move.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.960
Don't move.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.880
Come on, you ugly sod.
Let's have you.

34:59.120 --> 35:01.080
Who's that?

35:04.480 --> 35:06.440
Here.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.120
Identify yourself, please.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.240
Will you please identify yourself.

35:14.400 --> 35:17.365
Bear with me a sec.
A little bit busy at the moment.

35:17.400 --> 35:21.000
Danny, do you have the first idea
what you're doing up there?!

35:21.035 --> 35:23.400
Look, don't worry,
I'm an experienced pilot.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.160
How experienced?

35:27.520 --> 35:30.880
Two lessons. But they went
unbelievably well.

35:34.880 --> 35:37.400
All right. What's the plan?

35:37.435 --> 35:39.525
Well, to be honest,

35:39.560 --> 35:41.720
I'm pretty much making it up
as I go along.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.920
Get in.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.000
Get in!
What?

36:04.480 --> 36:06.485
What sort of lunatic is he?

36:06.520 --> 36:09.360
I think he's trying to lead it back
into the hangar.

36:09.395 --> 36:11.600
Connor, did you lock the anomaly?
Oh, yes.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.520
Oh, no...

36:21.640 --> 36:24.480
Get back to the hangar,
quick as you can. There, here!

36:27.560 --> 36:29.520
Ow, Connor, that's my...

36:32.960 --> 36:34.920
It is opening, don't stop.

36:34.955 --> 36:36.880
I bruise easily, you know.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.580
This is cool.

36:46.615 --> 36:48.560
This is good.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.880
Come on, let's go.

37:04.760 --> 37:06.760
Where are we going?

37:06.795 --> 37:08.805
The camera.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.240
We need evidence.
Let's just get out of here.

37:11.275 --> 37:13.200
No! I want that footage!

37:32.760 --> 37:36.400
What do you think you're doing?!
Ever heard of freedom of the press?

37:45.480 --> 37:47.440
Connor, now!

37:55.720 --> 37:58.120
You know what, I quit!

38:03.400 --> 38:06.280
Oh, this is going to be
an amazing shot!

38:09.080 --> 38:11.040
Woah, woah!

38:26.440 --> 38:28.400
Danny, can you hear me?

38:30.560 --> 38:33.040
We need to lock it again.
He might be alive.

38:33.075 --> 38:35.520
We can't take that risk.
He's got a minute.

38:35.555 --> 38:37.520
But, Jenny...
I'm in charge here!

38:37.555 --> 38:39.480
Just give him a chance.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.200
Well, I think you're making
a big mistake.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.280
OK, do it.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.320
There's something coming through.

39:07.355 --> 39:09.280
Lock it!

39:17.320 --> 39:19.280
Wait!

39:24.360 --> 39:26.720
There's a herd of them
and they're coming!

39:27.080 --> 39:29.280
Connor! I can't lock it
with him in the way!

39:45.960 --> 39:48.000
So what did you do
with the helicopter?

39:48.800 --> 39:50.880
I'll just nip back and get it,
shall I!

39:57.840 --> 39:59.840
Abby...
Yeah?

40:00.560 --> 40:03.800
I was just wondering if you managed
to sort everything out?

40:04.560 --> 40:07.320
You know, with... Jack?

40:10.560 --> 40:12.480
Connor...
Yeah?

40:14.840 --> 40:16.800
We need to talk.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.800
Later.
OK.

40:22.640 --> 40:25.000
I've got to get back now anyway.
Yeah, well,

40:25.035 --> 40:27.040
I have to put this stuff away.
Perfect.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.600
See you later then.
Yeah.

40:33.120 --> 40:35.080
For a talk.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.720
Thank you.

40:42.360 --> 40:45.480
You saved people's lives today.
Ssh, don't worry about it.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.760
Now I'm going to have to arrest you.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.280
Well, we all have our own unique
way of showing appreciation.

40:52.760 --> 40:55.280
You don't want to get involved
with this, Danny.

40:56.160 --> 40:58.280
People get killed.
I know that, Jenny.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.960
Remember?

41:02.680 --> 41:04.640
Go back to your life.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.960
Just forget
all this ever happened.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.320
Oh, and... get some flying lessons.

41:16.920 --> 41:19.480
Sorry if I got at you before.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.800
It's all right. It was pretty
tense there for a moment.

41:22.835 --> 41:24.720
You did a good job.

41:24.755 --> 41:26.725
Thanks.

41:26.760 --> 41:29.320
What do you want me to do
with our kamikaze pilot?

41:29.960 --> 41:31.925
I was just...

41:31.960 --> 41:33.920
Oh, you're kidding me!

41:34.680 --> 41:36.640
Come on...

41:53.040 --> 41:55.000
How's the head?

41:58.400 --> 42:01.120
Don't know. Might have knocked
some sense into me.

42:04.040 --> 42:06.000
Well done today.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.880
Cutter would have been proud
of you.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.960
Yeah.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.720
And you.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.120
All right?

42:24.560 --> 42:26.520
Come on.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.800
Hello?

42:35.840 --> 42:37.800
Hang on.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.640
Abby, listen, if there's...

42:45.280 --> 42:48.700
If there's something that
you want to talk to me about,

42:48.735 --> 42:52.120
some sort of problem, you can.
It's cool, I... can take it.

42:52.155 --> 42:54.080
You all right?

43:01.800 --> 43:04.120
Will you just put
some clothes on, please!

43:04.155 --> 43:06.440
Relax. I couldn't find
any conditioner.

43:06.475 --> 43:08.400
Jack. Nice to meet you.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.880
Connor.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.040
My baby brother.

43:23.560 --> 43:26.360
Sorry, I was going to explain.

43:26.395 --> 43:29.160
There's no explanation necessary.

43:29.195 --> 43:31.165
That's...

43:31.200 --> 43:33.160
That's your brother, wow.

43:33.960 --> 43:37.360
Couldn't find somewhere to crash
for a few days, could you? Eh?

43:37.395 --> 43:39.320
Abby, there's no hot water!

43:40.160 --> 43:42.165
Jack needs somewhere to stay.

43:42.200 --> 43:45.360
And I am his sister,
it's only temporary, Connor.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.685
Of course.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.720
That's... that's cool. I'll just...

43:51.520 --> 43:55.040
I'll stay at a mate's house or
something. Sure you're OK with it?

43:55.075 --> 43:57.520
A hundred percent.
Thank you.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.000
Thank you.
Oh...

44:07.840 --> 44:09.840
Hello, you two.

44:11.400 --> 44:14.120
It looks like we're going
on holiday. Yay!

44:15.880 --> 44:17.840
Yay!

44:18.360 --> 44:20.320
Wicked.

44:24.240 --> 44:27.120
I appreciate how hard things
have been for everyone.

44:28.440 --> 44:30.400
So I wanted to say thank you.

44:31.360 --> 44:33.320
For everything you've done.

44:35.800 --> 44:37.760
Calm, controlled
and slightly dull.

44:39.520 --> 44:41.525
Just like you asked for.

44:41.560 --> 44:43.520
Except for that G Rex, of course.

44:43.880 --> 44:45.840
Oh, minor detail.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.720
I spoke to Christine Johnson.
Oh?

44:49.640 --> 44:51.640
Did she tell you anything?

44:51.675 --> 44:53.640
No. I didn't expect her to.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.245
I see.
She's definitely up to something.

44:57.280 --> 45:00.000
And I'm going to find out what,
have no fear of that.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.880
You think the creatures
are frightening, Jenny,

45:04.240 --> 45:06.200
you should try the civil service.

45:21.560 --> 45:25.080
The fate of the nation possibly
the world hangs on what we do here.

45:25.115 --> 45:27.045
We need to find Sir Richard now.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.925
It's not a place
for chancers and wide-boys.

45:29.960 --> 45:32.605
Woah woah woah! You've seen
what I can do and I want in.

45:32.640 --> 45:36.000
What we thought was ash is spores.
It'll spread through London.

45:36.035 --> 45:38.440
This could be tricky
to explain to next of kin.

45:38.475 --> 45:40.497
Bad news,
he's turned into a mushroom.

45:40.532 --> 45:42.846
Corner it and then we grill it,
right?

45:42.881 --> 45:45.160
That thing was a man
not long ago.

45:45.960 --> 45:48.400
So, we ask it nicely,
then we grill it.

45:48.435 --> 45:50.760
Do not use a flame thrower.

45:51.120 --> 45:53.200
Jenny!
