00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:10.211 --> 00:12.411
-Riles?
-Peaches?

00:12.413 --> 00:15.214
-How you feeling today?
-Well, I didn't cry all night.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.682
That's good.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.851
Because I stopped
when I passed out from crying.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.354
-Well, you seem better now.
-That's where you're wrong.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.224
-Okay.
-But the seniors wanted
us to stand here,

00:25.226 --> 00:26.959
watch what goes on,
and learn from it.

00:26.961 --> 00:28.827
-They have their reason.
-To make fools out of us?

00:28.829 --> 00:30.162
Mission accomplished.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.663
We're fools.
We're fools without friends.

00:31.665 --> 00:32.898
They made their choice.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.733
They have started their
high school careers without us

00:34.735 --> 00:36.268
-and I wish them well.
-Yeah.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.903
Maybe we shouldn't
think about them today.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.039
Yeah.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.010
(sobs)

00:45.012 --> 00:46.779
I hope that Farkle remembers

00:46.781 --> 00:48.280
that science
can't explain people

00:48.282 --> 00:50.249
and he keeps
himself open to love.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.451
-You gonna do one for each?
-Yes.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.153
Give me a couple bucks
for a brownie.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.289
Okay, Maya.
I want juice.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.528
I hope Smackle
looks up from her books
every once in a while

01:02.530 --> 01:04.663
-so that she doesn't miss life.
-Maya: Apple?

01:04.665 --> 01:05.898
Grape.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.434
I hope Zay stops using comedy

01:08.436 --> 01:10.069
to cover up his inner turmoil.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.271
-Maya:
Uh, they're out of grape.
-Surprise me.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.407
They're not really
out of grape!

01:15.409 --> 01:16.842
(gasps)
What a nice surprise.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.711
Did you get to Lucas yet?

01:19.713 --> 01:20.813
I hope Lucas...

01:21.782 --> 01:22.848
I hope Lucas...

01:24.185 --> 01:26.819
(whispers)
I hope Lucas has
a very bad day.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.390
Gosh, you're cute.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.691
You know what?

01:32.693 --> 01:36.161
I'd rather be a fool with you
than to be anything without you.

01:36.163 --> 01:39.898
So... what can we learn
from down here?

01:39.900 --> 01:42.367
Hm, here comes
purple combat boots.

01:42.369 --> 01:44.903
I like her.
She walks with confidence.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.706
And here comes jungle girl.

01:49.510 --> 01:52.010
She's waiting
for motorcycle boots.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.314
Vroom, vroom.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.388
(shouts)
Vroom, vroom, baby!

02:04.325 --> 02:06.091
-Riles?
-Peaches?

02:06.093 --> 02:08.393
They're way more
advanced in high school.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.195
We're middle school
hand-holders.

02:10.197 --> 02:12.431
What if those seniors
sent us down here

02:12.433 --> 02:14.233
because we think
we're so ready for this place

02:14.235 --> 02:17.136
-and we're so not?
-Well, then I'd be right.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.804
And I hope that I'm right.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.305
Riley's wrong about this.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.874
We have as much right
as anybody else

02:21.876 --> 02:24.042
-to walk in these halls.
-Or anywhere we want.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.644
We're new here.
We got to show 'em we're strong.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.778
Both: Yeah!

02:26.780 --> 02:29.214
We wouldn't be here
if we didn't belong here.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.116
-Who's stronger than us?
-Yeah!

02:31.118 --> 02:32.151
Yeah!

02:32.153 --> 02:33.919
-Did I hurt you?
-A little bit,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.387
but who's stronger than us?

02:35.389 --> 02:36.455
Both: Yeah!

02:37.725 --> 02:39.925
-All right,
whose house is this?
-All: Our house!

02:39.927 --> 02:41.727
-Whose house is this?
-All: Our house!

02:41.729 --> 02:44.062
What happens
to the poor unfortunate soul

02:44.064 --> 02:46.198
who mistakenly
wanders into our house?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.833
(all scream)

02:51.138 --> 02:53.172
Why can't we
be on the football team

02:53.174 --> 02:54.540
if we want to be
on the football team?

02:54.542 --> 02:55.941
I'll tell you right now
what we got

02:55.943 --> 02:58.410
that they don't got:
enthusiasm, confidence,

02:58.412 --> 03:00.145
-and we're strong.
-Yeah!

03:00.147 --> 03:02.414
Will you please
stop hurting me?

03:04.618 --> 03:05.684
(screaming continues)

03:07.855 --> 03:09.288
-(blows whistle)
-(screaming stops)

03:10.624 --> 03:12.824
All right,
congratulations, ballerinas.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.960
You have achieved
practice level,

03:14.962 --> 03:16.562
but that's all that was,

03:16.564 --> 03:19.798
practice against
your fellow ballerinas.

03:21.035 --> 03:24.136
Okay? That was not a game
against opponents

03:24.138 --> 03:27.472
who are trying to
come into our house
and make it their house!

03:27.474 --> 03:28.974
How do we protect
this house?

03:28.976 --> 03:30.809
(all scream)

03:32.947 --> 03:34.146
(blows whistle)

03:35.516 --> 03:38.717
All right,
so we're not the brightest
team in the league.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.688
This is our locker room!

03:42.690 --> 03:44.756
I want you to do that
to the opponents...

03:45.726 --> 03:47.125
but I like what I'm seeing.

03:48.829 --> 03:52.698
I'll tell you,
the biggest regret
I got in my whole life

03:52.700 --> 03:56.902
is that we got no opponent
walking through that door

03:56.904 --> 04:00.205
right now into our house
so we can destroy them!

04:00.207 --> 04:01.640
(knock on door)

04:01.642 --> 04:03.108
Come in.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.946
Lucas and Zay in the house!

04:09.717 --> 04:12.284
We go to this high school
and we belong here,

04:12.286 --> 04:14.186
and we want to be
on the football team,

04:14.188 --> 04:15.954
and what are you
gonna do about it?

04:17.791 --> 04:18.991
Do what you must.

04:18.993 --> 04:21.059
-(grunting)
-(screams)

04:21.061 --> 04:22.527
-Lucas!
-(all screaming)

04:22.529 --> 04:23.929
I'm coming!

04:26.834 --> 04:28.567
Hey, how's it going?

04:30.237 --> 04:32.237

Done-zo. Kaput.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.033
Everything's changing.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.569
I lost my friends
and you're a mobster.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.572
Did you stop thinking about 'em?

05:40.574 --> 05:41.873
Yes.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.143
I wonder how everybody else
is doing except for them.

05:45.145 --> 05:48.013
Yo, yo, yo, where are
the geniuses up in this joint?

05:48.015 --> 05:51.583
I need me some stimuli.
Stimuli!

05:53.587 --> 05:54.820
Are you them?

05:54.822 --> 05:56.388
We are members

05:56.390 --> 05:59.257
of the Abagail Adams Society
of Intellectual Advancement.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.959
How may we be of service?

06:00.961 --> 06:02.994
Well, you could include us
in your little brain trust.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.629
You can more than include us.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.465
You can bow down to our
superior intellect.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.467
You can skip
whatever formal hooey

06:08.469 --> 06:11.036
it takes to join 'cause we're
gonna run this club.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.672
This is known as
the Smackle theory
of inevitability.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.608
By what criteria do you feel
you deserve acceptance?

06:16.610 --> 06:18.076
By this criteria:

06:18.078 --> 06:20.011
in middle school,
I used to be kind of a thing.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.446
My teacher allowed me
to step forward

06:21.448 --> 06:22.581
and take over the class.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.016
We called it "Farkle time."
I'm Farkle.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.385
And what have you done?

06:28.856 --> 06:30.789
I cloned myself.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.664
The same!

06:40.601 --> 06:41.733
(thud)

06:41.735 --> 06:43.402
I apologize for him.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.770
He is weak.
I am not.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.705
And I built her.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.342
(beeping)

06:54.448 --> 06:56.348
I'm comin', honey!

07:03.757 --> 07:06.725
I'm sorry your mom and dad
aren't together anymore, Ava.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.994
I wish there was something
I could do for you.

07:08.996 --> 07:12.063
You're my best friend, Auggie.
That's all I need right now.

07:12.065 --> 07:15.100
But I want you
to be happy again.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.436
It's okay if that takes
some time though, Ava.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.504
You know, maybe going to school
today will help take your mind

07:19.506 --> 07:20.739
off of everything for a bit.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.407
I don't think there
should be any school today.

07:23.710 --> 07:26.411
And I should just be able
to stay home and eat cheese.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.612
(chuckles)

07:27.614 --> 07:29.414
Then that's what
we're gonna do.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.749
No!

07:31.685 --> 07:34.052
Why "no"?
Why is it always no with you?

07:34.054 --> 07:37.789
(laughs)
Because life is real, Auggie.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.225
Sometimes you have to take
a real-life approach.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.359
And when
something bad happens,

07:41.361 --> 07:42.828
life wants you
to just keep going.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.830
Well, I think

07:44.832 --> 07:47.265
life is supposed to make sure
that when something bad happens,

07:47.267 --> 07:48.867
something good
should happen too.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.903
Your mom's right, Auggie.
This is real.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.606
Oh, yeah? You know
what else is real?

07:54.608 --> 07:56.041
You know we're not allowed

07:56.043 --> 07:58.743
to have dogs
in this building, right?

07:58.745 --> 08:00.378
Auggie!

08:00.380 --> 08:01.713
Are you gonna tell her?

08:01.715 --> 08:04.149
Ava, he's never told anyone.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.417
This would make you, like,

08:05.419 --> 08:07.686
the most special person
in the entire world.

08:07.688 --> 08:08.854
Tell me what?

08:08.856 --> 08:12.023
Scruffles!

08:12.025 --> 08:15.060
♪ Da-da-da-da-da-da-da ♪

08:15.062 --> 08:16.461
What?

08:17.865 --> 08:20.131
This is my imaginary dog
Scruffles.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.234
Scruffie, this is Ava,

08:22.236 --> 08:23.835
my best friend for real.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.304
Oh, that's great,
Auggie, but--

08:26.306 --> 08:29.441
He's wagging his tail!
He's excited to see you!

08:29.443 --> 08:31.309
He is?

08:31.311 --> 08:33.845
No, come on, Auggie.
He's not real.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.281
Then why is he trying
to give you his paw?

08:36.283 --> 08:37.649
(giggles)
He is?

08:37.651 --> 08:40.685
Hello, Scruffles!

08:40.687 --> 08:43.722
-He licked me!
-I saw that!

08:43.724 --> 08:47.526
Do we have to go to school
right this minute?

08:47.528 --> 08:50.328
Why don't we
bring Scruffles with us?

08:50.330 --> 08:53.231
Both:
Yay!

08:54.601 --> 08:56.201
Ava, do you want
to take his leash?

08:56.203 --> 08:57.769
Thanks, Auggie.

08:58.872 --> 08:59.938
Whoa!

09:02.509 --> 09:05.143
Huh.
(chuckles)

09:10.050 --> 09:11.850
I used to be
the smartest kid in school.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.351
How can we run this world
if there are people

09:13.353 --> 09:14.853
in this world
who are smarter than us?

09:14.855 --> 09:16.788
I feel ordinary.
What do we do?

09:16.790 --> 09:19.624
We need to take refuge in people
who are intellectual inferiors.

09:19.626 --> 09:22.127
-Hey, guys.
-Both: Yay.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.795
You need some
intellectual inferiors?

09:23.797 --> 09:25.497
Yep. You need
some physical inferiors?

09:25.499 --> 09:26.898
Both: Yay.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.401
So, we all
get our butts kicked?

09:29.403 --> 09:30.902
I don't even feel
like I'm me anymore.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.370
Yeah, these first
few days of high school

09:32.372 --> 09:33.538
couldn't have gone worse for us.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.273
You feel bad about finding out
there are people here

09:35.275 --> 09:37.509
-bigger than you?
-No, I expected that.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.010
-That's not it.
-You feel bad 'cause you know

09:39.012 --> 09:42.247
it's not gonna be anywhere
near as easy as we thought here?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.883
No, I'm fine with a challenge.
That's not it either.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.284
It's about us, isn't it?

09:46.286 --> 09:47.619
Is there an "us" anymore?

09:47.621 --> 09:49.688
-That's it.
-So look, man,

09:49.690 --> 09:51.890
let's go back to Riley and Maya
and tell them we feel bad.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.124
-No, I can't do that.
-Why not?

09:53.126 --> 09:54.826
Because I feel bad.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.228
-What are you talking about?
-Let's just go back

09:57.230 --> 09:59.030
and say
we're sorry we left them
and start all over.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.532
No, I understand
what Lucas is talking about.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.133
We left them.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.170
Well, we just wanted to see
what high school was like.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.706
-They'll be okay.
-No, you have to
understand Riley.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.274
Riley has such
faith in people.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.709
I mean, yeah,
she had faith in the seniors.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.210
But she has
even more faith in us.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.948
You know what?
I not only can't
protect them here,

10:16.950 --> 10:18.917
but I abandoned them.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.385
It's not that we can't
go back to them.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.953
It's that we don't deserve to.

10:23.457 --> 10:26.091
We left them.
I left them alone.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.360
They believe in something,
and I left them alone.

10:28.362 --> 10:30.695
How do you
come back from that?

10:30.697 --> 10:32.964
How do we ever
face them again?

10:42.109 --> 10:44.776
Why "massacre"?
Why you got "massacre" up there?

10:44.778 --> 10:47.245
Why can't you just teach us
names and dates?

10:47.247 --> 10:49.614
Marly Evans
and what she learns today!

10:49.616 --> 10:52.150
That's the name
and date I care about.

10:52.152 --> 10:56.021
All of you and right now,
are you listening to me?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.355
Mm-hmm.

10:57.357 --> 11:02.394
Good.
It was patriots who
founded our new land

11:02.396 --> 11:04.729
and it was patriots
who fought for it.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.465
Why do we remember the Alamo?

11:07.467 --> 11:10.969
Farkle, Smackle, a duet. Go.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.138
The Alamo was a small,
isolated fortress

11:13.140 --> 11:14.973
with a handful
of patriots inside

11:14.975 --> 11:17.575
who felt it was important
to stick together and fight
for what they believed.

11:17.577 --> 11:20.278
They were surrounded by
a much larger number of people,

11:20.280 --> 11:21.646
coming at them
from all directions,

11:21.648 --> 11:23.348
who believed
this place belonged to them.

11:25.585 --> 11:28.119
The patriots desperately
wanted reinforcements,

11:28.121 --> 11:29.688
but reinforcements never came.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.492
What happened to 'em?

11:34.494 --> 11:35.894
They stayed in their fortress

11:35.896 --> 11:37.862
and gave everybody
a friendly smile,

11:37.864 --> 11:39.764
and eventually,
they walked upstairs.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.435
They were massacred.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.170
Then they walked upstairs?

11:46.506 --> 11:49.574
No, but that battle gave birth
to a slogan.

11:49.576 --> 11:50.608
What was the slogan?

11:50.610 --> 11:53.144
-Remember the Alamo.
-Remember the Alamo!

11:53.146 --> 11:55.246
And why do we
remember the Alamo?

11:55.248 --> 11:57.649
Lucas, Zay, a duet.

11:57.651 --> 12:01.586
Because the patriots
gave their lives
for a greater good.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.188
That battle
had only just begun,

12:03.190 --> 12:05.223
and some years later
that land became ours,

12:05.225 --> 12:07.158
-and the name
of that land was...
-Texas!

12:07.160 --> 12:08.326
Stop it!

12:09.796 --> 12:12.297
Right, Texas, your home.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.166
So, guys, that's why
we remember the Alamo

12:15.168 --> 12:18.203
and why we remember all
the battles that we fight

12:18.205 --> 12:20.305
in an effort to make
a new place our home.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.707
Now, you can stay massacred

12:22.709 --> 12:25.677
or you can realize
the battle has just begun.

12:25.679 --> 12:28.079
We were kings, Mathews.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.215
Kingdoms fall.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.683
Everyone who believes

12:31.685 --> 12:34.052
they're gonna
rule the world falls.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.655
Everyone who believes
they're strong

12:37.657 --> 12:39.824
eventually comes up against
someone that's stronger.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.861
And every patriot
fighting for a cause,

12:42.863 --> 12:46.097
they're only as strong as
the cause they're fighting for.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.633
Even I know
next thing he says,

12:48.635 --> 12:50.835
real important.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.939
What's the cause
you're fighting for?

13:03.750 --> 13:05.517
They're still not
even talking to us.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.185
-They won't even look at us.
-I don't blame them.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.753
-It's my fault.
-What did we do?

13:08.755 --> 13:10.755
We didn't go after them, Maya.
They left.

13:10.757 --> 13:11.790
We stayed behind.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.259
We got to keep more eyes on me.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.594
Sometimes I go
too full-on-Riley.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.063
(knocking)

13:21.268 --> 13:24.102
-Some of your friends are here.
-Really?

13:24.104 --> 13:26.037
Right in here, guys.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.409
You!

13:33.013 --> 13:34.546
Nice room.

13:34.548 --> 13:35.647
Thanks.

13:36.817 --> 13:37.882
Why are you guys here?

13:37.884 --> 13:40.718
-You guys sit in this window?
-All the time.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.555
-How come?
-It's our safe place.

13:43.557 --> 13:44.889
Why do you need a safe place?

13:44.891 --> 13:46.491
'Cause there's
a whole world out there

13:46.493 --> 13:48.092
that we don't understand.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.228
Why did you guys
throw us into a hole?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.697
-Why us?
-When we were in middle school,

13:52.699 --> 13:54.098
we were six great friends
just like you.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.534
Three of us thought
we'd kick high school's butt,

13:56.536 --> 13:58.269
figure out
the whole thing real fast.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.573
Three of us were smarter,
took some time to figure out
the new surroundings.

14:01.575 --> 14:04.342
-And that was you guys?
-You guys took some time

14:04.344 --> 14:05.810
to figure things out
before you jumped in?

14:05.812 --> 14:08.580
No, we were the ones
who broke off from our friends.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.150
-Why?
-You never mean
to lose friends,

14:12.152 --> 14:14.352
but high school
has a lot of things
calling for your attention.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.155
You get caught up,
friendships can come apart.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.424
Yeah, I've heard that.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.226
You guys don't see
your friends anymore?

14:21.228 --> 14:24.629
Oh, we still see 'em.
It's just not like what it was.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.131
-That can happen?
-Yeah.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.300
But you three
are still together.

14:29.302 --> 14:32.704
-The three of us are...
-Complicated.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.876
-Oh, they like each other.
-They're a triangle.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.144
-You like each other.
-You're a triangle!

14:40.146 --> 14:42.881
Don't lose your friends.

14:42.883 --> 14:46.050
-But they're angry at us.
-No, they're not angry
at you at all.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.219
-Then what are they?
-They're humiliated.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.721
-Like we were.
-Why?

14:49.723 --> 14:53.524
'Cause it's high school,
and everybody gets massacred.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.627
That's why you guys put us
into a safe place.

14:55.629 --> 14:58.429
That's not the safe place.
That's a hole.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.900
We just wanted
you guys to be together.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.169
Your safe place is each other.

15:06.606 --> 15:07.906
Go get your friends.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.210
How did you guys
resolve the triangle?

15:12.212 --> 15:14.846
Oh, let me see.
Do you still like him?

15:14.848 --> 15:16.547
-Yeah. Do you still like him?
-Yeah.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.849
We need to decide.

15:27.661 --> 15:31.896
Scruffles, sit.
Scruffles, roll over.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.098
Scruffles,
fly around the room!

15:35.769 --> 15:37.602
Isn't he amazing?

15:38.872 --> 15:40.204
He told her about Scruffles?

15:40.206 --> 15:42.240
He did.
She's the only person
he's ever told.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.708
He was trying
to make her feel better.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.345
-Did it work?
-I think it might
be wearing off.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.381
Auggie, sit.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.686
You don't want
to play with Scruffles?

15:54.688 --> 15:57.121
Scruffles ain't doing it
for me anymore.

15:58.658 --> 15:59.724
Have I let you down?

16:00.894 --> 16:02.260
You did so good, Auggie.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.395
Thanks for trying so hard.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.999
What's happening?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.467
Well, I think Ava might be ready
for the real-life approach now.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.570
She knows that
Scruffles is made up

16:12.572 --> 16:14.105
but that
your friendship is real.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.641
And then when you don't
understand what life is doing,

16:16.643 --> 16:18.943
the most important thing
friends can be

16:18.945 --> 16:20.578
is there for each other.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.081
-Auggie.
-Yeah?

16:23.083 --> 16:24.983
Stay.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.385
I will.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.887
Good Auggie.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.168
Look at us.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.104
Look at us.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.339
-Look at us.
-Look at us.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.576
-We're sorry.
-You're sorry?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.811
-What are you sorry for?
-We're the ones who left.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.480
We should have realized
something happened to you.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.115
But nothing happened to us.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.516
Why do you think
something happened to us?

16:58.518 --> 17:01.285
We found out we we're stupid
and they got beat up
like pipsqueaks.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.106
Don't look at me.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.024
I'll look at you whenever
I want to look at you,
Huckleberry.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.060
Everybody's stronger than me.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.129
None of this matters.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.530
Guys, the only way
we're gonna get through

17:12.532 --> 17:14.499
our one year of high school
is together like we always have.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.833
Maya, there's four years
of high school.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.235
I'm out.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.237
Could somebody please explain
to me what's going on here?

17:19.239 --> 17:21.205
Because I guess I really don't
know anything anymore.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.341
I think they're forgiving us
for behaving badly.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.842
Smackle,
you didn't behave badly.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.444
When you left,
we should have gone with you.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.846
No, when you stayed,
we should have stayed with you.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.848
I don't know
what's the matter with me.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.550
Lucas, you left

17:32.552 --> 17:34.352
because you don't think
that you can protect us here.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.121
We all need
to protect each other here.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.758
Okay?
No matter what happens
at high school,

17:40.760 --> 17:42.593
we're the cause
worth fighting for.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.829
Us. Nobody leaves.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.031
Even if we get massacred?

17:47.033 --> 17:49.333
We're gonna get massacred
no matter what we do.

17:49.335 --> 17:52.737
I'd like to say that
we've never gotten hurt
when we're together.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.506
And it was my fault
that we weren't.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.042
I'm truly sorry about that

17:58.044 --> 17:59.777
and I hope
it never happens again.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.815
You guys showed us
what it means to be strong...

18:04.984 --> 18:06.084
and smart.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.525
You still like him?

18:16.329 --> 18:17.695
I still like him.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.468
I like us all.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.415
Our classroom is empty.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.617
Oh, come on!
Who does this?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.752
-Me.
-(scoffs)

18:41.754 --> 18:44.622
Okay, so what
I want to ask now
is why?

18:45.558 --> 18:46.591
Everybody take a seat.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.559
Go on, go on,
have a seat.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.098
What have you learned
in high school so far?

18:54.100 --> 18:57.201
-We're not kings anymore.
-We're Abagail Adams Patriots.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.770
Abagail Adams once said,

18:59.772 --> 19:02.240
"To be good
and to do good

19:02.242 --> 19:04.108
is the whole duty of man."

19:04.110 --> 19:06.577
"Do good"?
Don't you mean do well?

19:06.579 --> 19:09.780
Do you know what the funny thing
is about history, Miss Evans?

19:10.884 --> 19:11.949
It repeats.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.318
I mean "do good."

19:15.555 --> 19:16.954
That, right up there...

19:19.592 --> 19:21.726
That's always
gonna be my lesson plan.

19:23.296 --> 19:26.731
Now, when the patriots
looked out

19:26.733 --> 19:29.100
at this new
undiscovered land,
it was what?

19:29.102 --> 19:31.536
Rough and undeveloped,
like us.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.171
Very good, Mr. Babineaux.

19:33.173 --> 19:36.641
But they stuck together
and they made it their new home.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.709
So will we.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.378
Let's fill this room.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.847
Let's fill this room
with knowledge.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.615
What do you know?

19:44.617 --> 19:46.517
I have faith
that in a new place

19:46.519 --> 19:48.686
you can learn from the people
who have already been there.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.856
Very good.
Go get your desk.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.495
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Where are you going?

19:57.497 --> 20:02.333
In any new place, or old place,
or any place at all,

20:02.335 --> 20:04.735
I stay with her.

20:04.737 --> 20:05.870
I'm always with her.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.139
But I knew that
a long time ago.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.209
Lucas, what do you know?

20:12.245 --> 20:14.011
There are stronger
people than us here.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.279
What are you
gonna do about it?

20:15.281 --> 20:16.514
Get stronger.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.450
Farkle?

20:20.787 --> 20:22.820
There are smarter people
than us here.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.121
What are you
gonna do about it?

20:24.123 --> 20:26.924
I think you know.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.629
All right, everybody,
go get your desks.

20:37.170 --> 20:41.138
In this room,
we find out how history
relates to your present

20:41.140 --> 20:44.008
and how you can't get by
on the successes of your past.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.811
This is your new school,
guys.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.848
Stick together. Do good.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.151
That's how you're
gonna have your best future.

20:56.155 --> 20:59.523
In this room,
I'm your teacher...

21:00.593 --> 21:03.694
but we are going to discover
this new land together.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.130
This is how he teaches?

21:07.066 --> 21:08.132
Every day.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.970
You going to get your desk,
Miss Evans?

21:12.972 --> 21:15.473
No, I'm going to get yours.

21:24.851 --> 21:25.916
Ready?

21:27.086 --> 21:28.152
Ready.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.429
I'm glad you guys
picked me and my friends.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.498
We wish someone
would've done it for us.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.400
You really
put us through it.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.567
I know.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.002
You messed with our heads.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.103
I did.

21:46.105 --> 21:48.539
We'll be better friends
because of it.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.707
You will.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.776
Thank you.

21:51.778 --> 21:52.877
You're welcome.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.146
We'll be here
for you guys anytime.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.183
You trying out
for the football team?

22:00.119 --> 22:01.252
-Uh...
-Nah.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.122
Are you trying out
for the football team?

22:07.660 --> 22:08.726
Both:
Yeah!

22:10.330 --> 22:11.662
Good.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.998
Now that we're seniors
and we've learned so much
in this place...

22:14.000 --> 22:15.666
We wanted to
leave somebody a--

22:15.668 --> 22:16.734
Legacy?

22:17.637 --> 22:19.537
Yeah, a legacy.

22:20.573 --> 22:21.872
Pass it on someday.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.181
We will.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.583
When we're kings.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.651
(bell rings)
