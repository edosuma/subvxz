01:24.334 --> 01:27.753
We're almost there.*[POL]

01:34.260 --> 01:36.095
The doctors are looking at us.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.014
Try to hold on.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.312
You're nervous.
That's what makes you cough.

01:45.563 --> 01:49.108
Plug your ears and pray to
The Mother of God.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.110
Alright.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.448
We'll soon be at aunt Edyta's
and

01:56.574 --> 01:58.492
we'll be safe together.

01:59.953 --> 02:04.373
We'll start our families
and have plenty of children.*

02:44.581 --> 02:45.539
What are they saying?*

02:55.758 --> 02:56.758
- No.
- Ewa, it's fine.*

02:56.926 --> 02:57.593
Go without me.*

03:01.431 --> 03:06.185
Magda, I promise I'll get you out!*

25:38.870 --> 25:40.871
Muy caliente !*(very hot)

37:02.720 --> 37:03.720
Who is it?*

37:07.391 --> 37:08.767
- Auntie
- Wojtek ! Ewa !

37:14.398 --> 37:16.358
They told me you weren't there,

37:16.525 --> 37:18.568
but I found you, auntie!

37:19.445 --> 37:20.570
Thank God.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.079
Come in. We looked for you
a long time. 

37:26.080 --> 37:28.620
It's a miracle.

37:28.788 --> 37:29.996
Edyta, who is it?

37:30.623 --> 37:34.000
Wojtek! Wojtek, my niece is here!

37:35.962 --> 37:38.630
Ewa found us!

37:45.012 --> 37:48.348
We haven't seen each other
since the wedding.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.059
But I remember you.

37:53.646 --> 37:56.064
Give her something to eat and drink.

37:56.649 --> 37:57.649
Yes, of course.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.026
Come, I'll make you some tea.

38:09.161 --> 38:11.663
They said you weren't there, on the boat.

38:13.582 --> 38:16.293
Your uncle went to Ellis Island and

38:16.711 --> 38:19.170
they said you hadn't come.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.007
No, WE were there.

38:23.759 --> 38:26.011
they said YOU weren't there.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.848
They said your adress wasn't valid.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.976
But I knew it wasn't so.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.186
That you wouldn't have forgotten us.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.982
Of course we'd never forget you!

38:39.567 --> 38:41.192
Never.

38:43.362 --> 38:44.863
Where's Magda ?

38:47.616 --> 38:50.660
She had to stay in the hospital.
She's sick.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.581
But she sent me a letter.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.500
With your help we can get her out.

39:03.632 --> 39:05.925
Magda was very brave.

39:13.225 --> 39:16.353
Without her, I wouldn't be here.

39:20.483 --> 39:22.567
I'm very tired...

39:24.111 --> 39:25.737
But I'm well.

39:37.625 --> 39:40.168
Tomorrow we'll go to church

39:40.378 --> 39:42.796
to give thanks.

39:44.256 --> 39:45.965
Let her rest.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.136
Of course. Yes.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.517
Dear, you're safe now.

39:56.811 --> 40:00.563
You'll be very happy in this country.
You'll see.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.400
We live well, here.

40:05.611 --> 40:08.154
You'll find a nice man and

40:08.739 --> 40:11.074
you'll get married.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.034
Sleep, now.

40:13.536 --> 40:15.495
You'll feel better.

40:28.592 --> 40:31.928
Don't lose hope, dear.

40:32.638 --> 40:35.932
The nightingale's song is
always sweetest

40:36.100 --> 40:37.934
at the darkest hour.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.692
Sleep.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.323
Magda.

41:52.301 --> 41:54.177
I was dreaming.*

42:08.901 --> 42:10.026
Why?*

42:12.905 --> 42:15.365
I have a good reputation, a business...

42:15.824 --> 42:17.534
I don't want to be dishonored.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.994
I didn't do anything.

42:20.162 --> 42:24.207
They told me what you did
on the boat!

42:24.375 --> 42:26.709
- You're shameful.
- No.

42:26.877 --> 42:27.627
A whore!

42:28.087 --> 42:30.547
Be grateful we let you
sleep here last night!

42:30.714 --> 42:32.966
No! It's a lie!

42:34.426 --> 42:36.344
Aunt Edyta! It's not true!

42:36.554 --> 42:37.220
That's enough.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.973
- Don't speak to her!
- What about Magda?

42:40.099 --> 42:43.393
I pray for her.
She's sick, you poisoned her!

42:43.936 --> 42:44.978
Where are you taking her?

42:45.104 --> 42:46.271
Shut up!

42:46.814 --> 42:50.191
- Tell me where they're taking her!
- It's MY house!*

43:51.462 --> 43:52.962
Are you Polish?*

43:53.505 --> 43:55.381
We're from Lodz.

43:56.133 --> 43:59.385
It's terrible, how they treat us here.

43:59.553 --> 44:01.429
As if we were nothing.

44:02.806 --> 44:04.849
I'm NOT nothing.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.408
Mary, mother of God,

You don't need him?

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.168
Really?

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:42.130

and my father.

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.398

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:27.275
We need to talk.
I need your help.

01:38:28.611 --> 01:38:31.487
Please, auntie. I beg you.

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:54.302
It's so hard to say it...

01:38:58.974 --> 01:39:01.225
Last Sunday I went to church.

01:39:02.478 --> 01:39:04.771
First time in a long while.

01:39:07.983 --> 01:39:10.234
I prayed to the Holy Virgin.

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:17.033
I've gone through so many trials.

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:23.706
Is it a sin to try to survive?

01:39:31.423 --> 01:39:32.423
Auntie...

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:41.015
Is it a sin to want to survive

01:39:41.183 --> 01:39:43.434
when I've done so many bad things?

01:39:50.526 --> 01:39:53.236
Your uncle is a proud man.

01:39:55.447 --> 01:39:57.490
I can't change him.

01:39:59.868 --> 01:40:00.868
I know.

01:40:04.081 --> 01:40:07.041
I know he's rejected me.

01:40:07.209 --> 01:40:09.711
But I'm asking you

01:40:11.463 --> 01:40:15.466
to believe I can be saved.

01:40:20.264 --> 01:40:21.472
God sent me

01:40:21.598 --> 01:40:24.183
to someone who's really lost,

01:40:25.769 --> 01:40:31.232
someone who turned my life into a sin.

01:40:31.775 --> 01:40:32.775
And now,

01:40:36.113 --> 01:40:38.239
this person is suffering for me.

01:40:41.452 --> 01:40:45.121
So I'm learning the power of forgiveness.

01:40:48.584 --> 01:40:49.751
Auntie...

01:40:51.336 --> 01:40:52.879
I need money...

01:40:54.798 --> 01:40:55.840
for Magda.

01:40:57.968 --> 01:40:59.052
A lot.

01:41:02.681 --> 01:41:06.642
But we won't come back, ever.

01:41:10.272 --> 01:41:11.731
Will you help me?

01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:18.112
Can't you forgive me?*
