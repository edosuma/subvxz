00:41.584 --> 00:45.927
New York
February 16, 1959

00:52.657 --> 00:55.592
Hurry! She collapsed ten minutes ago.

01:28.499 --> 01:30.026
The ambulance is here.

01:57.398 --> 02:00.431
Saint Theresa, my sweet Jesus,
don't abandon me...

02:00.597 --> 02:03.762
...give me strength,
I want to go on living.

02:03.925 --> 02:06.314
Bring me back to life.

02:28.727 --> 02:29.775
Why are you crying?

02:29.942 --> 02:32.245
Scram, you brats!

02:47.704 --> 02:49.297
What are you doing here?

02:50.297 --> 02:52.271
Why are you crying?

02:52.440 --> 02:54.383
Are you all alone?

02:55.641 --> 02:57.529
Where's your mommy?

03:20.282 --> 03:23.184
You're her mother?
You worthless piece of trash!

03:23.354 --> 03:25.591
Gotta make a living somehow.
I'm a singer.

03:25.755 --> 03:27.129
What about your daughter?

03:27.292 --> 03:29.114
What about her? She's taken care of.

03:38.684 --> 03:41.586
Louis, I can't go on
waiting for you like this.

03:41.756 --> 03:43.992
Belleville's unbearable.

03:44.443 --> 03:46.299
An impresario said with my talent...

03:46.460 --> 03:51.065
...I should try Constantinople
like the singer FrÃ©hel.

03:51.229 --> 03:53.530
Good news for our acrobat?

03:53.916 --> 03:57.812
Sure...
Commendations from Clemenceau.

04:03.933 --> 04:06.071
I left Edith with my mother.

04:06.237 --> 04:09.717
Mamma AÃ¯cha will keep her
until my career takes off.

04:10.301 --> 04:13.650
Louis, I've stopped waiting for you.

04:14.814 --> 04:16.243
Anetta.

04:38.975 --> 04:40.601
Anybody home?

05:13.282 --> 05:14.656
Edith?

05:23.202 --> 05:24.151
Louis?

05:28.834 --> 05:30.427
Enough's enough.

06:29.254 --> 06:30.203
What's this?

06:32.837 --> 06:34.016
Your grandchild...

06:34.983 --> 06:36.357
Edith.

06:39.334 --> 06:41.277
What a strange name.

06:48.615 --> 06:50.623
She's a sickly child.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.170
Follow me.

07:04.872 --> 07:06.912
What are you doing here?

07:07.400 --> 07:09.953
You're so cute. What's your name?

07:10.121 --> 07:11.681
Back to work, Titine!

07:11.848 --> 07:14.631
Someone's in the upstairs toilet.

07:15.113 --> 07:17.251
You've beautiful blue eyes.

07:22.794 --> 07:24.255
Come on.

07:31.498 --> 07:33.092
I'm listening...

07:35.050 --> 07:36.676
I have to go back.

07:38.155 --> 07:42.759
I'll be demobilized soon.
Then I'll go back to the circus.

07:43.819 --> 07:45.345
I came to see my cherub.

07:45.514 --> 07:48.100
-Get out.
-I'm all done, Mamma Louise.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.154
Tend the door.

07:55.915 --> 07:57.671
Where's her mother?

07:58.572 --> 08:00.034
I don't know.

08:04.172 --> 08:06.179
Want to leave her here?

08:08.268 --> 08:09.795
People will gossip.

08:09.964 --> 08:12.419
People always gossip.

08:48.334 --> 08:50.244
Should we take her to Mass?

08:53.039 --> 08:54.348
We're gonna be late.

08:54.511 --> 08:57.992
Enough. The world doesn't revolve
around her.

09:04.528 --> 09:06.502
I hear we're keeping a baby.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.014
Can we see it?

09:08.176 --> 09:09.638
It's a girl, not a baby.

09:09.808 --> 09:12.197
-Want some bread?
-Get on!

09:14.513 --> 09:16.487
Go on, ask her to sing.

09:19.313 --> 09:22.030
You'd be on the stage,
but your hair's too red.

11:00.758 --> 11:03.922
Titine! Titine, open up. Enough of this!

11:04.086 --> 11:06.869
-Now what?
-She's with Edith.

11:07.031 --> 11:08.918
Open this door now!

11:09.080 --> 11:10.160
-What's going on?
-Nothing!

11:10.327 --> 11:14.038
Get ready, the gentlemen
will be here soon.

11:14.872 --> 11:17.393
-Open up or else!
-I can't work.

11:19.064 --> 11:21.552
-I can't work!
-Really!

11:21.720 --> 11:23.793
You think this is a hotel?

11:24.568 --> 11:27.536
I'm keeping Edith. I'm keeping her.

11:27.704 --> 11:29.909
That's what you think!

11:31.162 --> 11:32.590
It's me, open up.

11:32.761 --> 11:34.420
Your legionnaire's here.

11:34.585 --> 11:35.993
I don't care.

11:36.154 --> 11:39.285
He's a liar.
He tells me nothing but lies.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.456
Titine, stop this right now.

11:41.625 --> 11:44.920
Come out
or you'll be on the street so fast!

11:45.081 --> 11:47.602
Enough of your antics!

11:58.554 --> 12:00.048
I don't want trouble.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.442
Doug!

12:28.189 --> 12:30.043
What? Are you jealous?

12:31.548 --> 12:34.363
I sent your Billie Holiday records
to the hotel.

12:34.525 --> 12:35.572
Thank you, Loulou.

12:35.740 --> 12:39.286
Billie and I were born
the same year. Funny!

12:41.565 --> 12:43.572
I brought my sketches.

12:44.733 --> 12:47.450
Do you want to see them now or later?

12:47.613 --> 12:50.962
Later. I've got to sing that fool's song.

12:52.989 --> 12:53.972
Before your time...

12:54.302 --> 12:55.414
What?

12:55.582 --> 12:56.565
Forget it.

12:58.910 --> 13:00.339
Let's go.

13:23.999 --> 13:25.494
I'm ready.

13:26.079 --> 13:27.486
Let's go.

14:45.157 --> 14:46.717
It's Jeanne!

14:50.053 --> 14:51.776
Jeanne, what's wrong?

14:52.485 --> 14:54.689
-There's blood...
-Talk to us!

14:54.853 --> 14:58.301
He wanted to play doctor,
with his instruments.

14:58.470 --> 14:59.583
The bastard!

15:02.085 --> 15:03.427
Titine!

15:03.589 --> 15:05.051
We must tell Madam.

15:05.222 --> 15:07.459
She'll kill me. It hurts.

15:10.407 --> 15:12.414
I can't see!

15:30.792 --> 15:33.606
-Well, doctor?
-Her health's fragile.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.801
It's her cornea. She has keratitis.

15:37.864 --> 15:39.042
Is she blind?

15:39.912 --> 15:41.953
It's an inflammation.

15:42.888 --> 15:45.191
Be patient. It takes months.

15:45.769 --> 15:48.835
Take this to the pharmacy.

15:49.929 --> 15:51.391
Thank you.

15:51.561 --> 15:52.870
Whose child is she?

15:55.018 --> 15:56.708
Nobody's.

16:40.556 --> 16:43.655
Theresa, I rarely ask anything of you...

16:43.820 --> 16:46.209
...I only ask that you hear little Edith.

16:46.861 --> 16:50.025
Go on, Edith.
Speak to her. She'll listen.

16:50.189 --> 16:51.433
Go ahead.

16:52.300 --> 16:53.642
Theresa...

16:53.804 --> 16:56.554
...I don't want to be blind.
I want to see.

16:56.717 --> 16:58.146
She's all bruised.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.365
Go on.

16:59.533 --> 17:02.882
I want to learn to read,
and run like before.

17:03.053 --> 17:04.395
I don't want to be blind.

17:04.557 --> 17:08.451
Saint Theresa, tell baby Jesus
to look after Edith.

17:09.261 --> 17:10.756
Go ahead.

17:11.085 --> 17:13.606
Thank you, Saint Theresa and Jesus.

17:13.773 --> 17:15.236
Thank you.

17:51.441 --> 17:53.546
You're home, Edith.

18:04.945 --> 18:08.141
-Louise?
-Quickly...

18:08.562 --> 18:10.285
Come with me.

19:16.374 --> 19:17.836
She can see...

19:19.318 --> 19:20.527
She can see!

19:29.463 --> 19:31.317
Titine, get up!

19:31.479 --> 19:34.861
-What is it?
-He's back. He's taking Edith.

19:35.031 --> 19:36.373
Get dressed.

19:36.535 --> 19:38.772
They can't do that to me!

19:39.095 --> 19:41.714
How can you go back to that job?

19:41.879 --> 19:43.635
She'll see the country.

19:43.799 --> 19:44.847
Go then.

19:46.744 --> 19:48.053
Edith!

19:48.216 --> 19:49.743
Titine!

19:51.320 --> 19:53.142
Don't take my little girl!

19:53.304 --> 19:55.246
Let her go!

19:55.704 --> 19:57.297
Enough!

19:57.465 --> 19:58.413
She's mad!

19:59.033 --> 20:00.408
Stop it or you're out!

20:00.569 --> 20:01.976
You have no right!

20:08.729 --> 20:10.224
Don't do this to me!

20:10.393 --> 20:11.506
Go!

20:20.602 --> 20:21.780
I'll kill myself.

20:28.058 --> 20:29.400
We're at Orly airport.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.511
Paris, Orly
June 1959

20:30.682 --> 20:33.333
Passengers are disembarking.
I see her. It's Edith Piaf!

20:33.498 --> 20:35.408
A young man's on her arm.

20:35.578 --> 20:37.433
What did you bring from America?

20:37.594 --> 20:39.023
An American.

20:39.195 --> 20:40.722
What's his name?

20:40.891 --> 20:41.906
Edith, please!

20:44.187 --> 20:47.351
Like her song,
she's "carried away by the crowd"...

20:47.515 --> 20:50.679
She steps into her elegant
black and white car.

20:51.867 --> 20:54.039
She looks tired, but is all smiles.

21:01.116 --> 21:03.221
Silence! I propose a toast...

21:03.901 --> 21:05.788
What a slob!

21:05.948 --> 21:07.323
Slob yourself.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.707
Indulge the invalid.

21:12.093 --> 21:15.541
Watch out, accordion man,
or you'll get a shiner!

21:17.725 --> 21:18.935
Perfect timing!

21:19.101 --> 21:22.418
Call the boss. I want free champagne!

21:22.590 --> 21:26.103
I'm Edith Piaf, and I made a mess.

21:26.461 --> 21:29.942
Everyone kiss. Even enemies!

21:30.109 --> 21:31.933
Kiss me, Claude.

21:40.223 --> 21:42.394
-Who's that broad?
-No idea.

21:42.559 --> 21:44.282
Who gets the steak tartare?

21:44.447 --> 21:46.934
Where did your handsome friend go?

21:47.103 --> 21:48.281
Don't embarrass her...

21:48.447 --> 21:51.349
Butt out, Coquatrix,
who rang your bell?

21:51.519 --> 21:53.657
Well... Mademoiselle!

21:53.824 --> 21:57.239
Miss Piaf, a pleasure!
What can I do for you?

21:58.272 --> 22:00.444
A lot. I want a present.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.073
Naturally.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.484
Well...

22:03.648 --> 22:06.682
I wanted champagne,
but I'll take a ring...

22:06.848 --> 22:10.110
...a big ring with diamonds
studded everywhere.

22:10.272 --> 22:13.850
Don't trouble yourself,
we'll have champagne.

22:14.529 --> 22:17.398
Here's a toast
to the love I have for you all.

22:17.569 --> 22:19.609
And I'll stand up for that.

22:19.777 --> 22:21.500
Give me a hand.

22:25.185 --> 22:28.219
I'd like to make a toast to Marguerite.

22:30.178 --> 22:34.367
My composer and my most loyal friend
in the business.

22:35.458 --> 22:39.682
Don't blush like that,
you'll make us cry.

22:54.851 --> 22:56.160
You want an autograph?

22:56.611 --> 22:58.521
I don't think so.

23:00.484 --> 23:03.997
Bubbles and booze, perfect.
This is Claude's influence.

23:04.164 --> 23:05.986
You're irritating, Loulou.

23:06.147 --> 23:09.246
We're just back to Paris,
we had some fun.

23:12.580 --> 23:14.882
Don't play the broken-hearted lover.

23:18.884 --> 23:21.568
I'm waiting for someone. Get lost.

23:21.733 --> 23:24.155
Let me remind you,
you have commitments.

23:24.325 --> 23:26.081
You're not alone.

23:26.245 --> 23:28.929
Remember the first night at Gerny's?

23:30.405 --> 23:34.082
I was a bum.
She looked at me like a princess.

23:34.245 --> 23:36.450
You were a princess. My princess!

23:37.158 --> 23:38.107
To Marguerite!

23:40.166 --> 23:43.014
To those who want
to see me fall on my face.

23:43.175 --> 23:46.436
They think I don't notice! Cheers.

23:51.846 --> 23:53.275
Something wrong, Louis?

23:53.446 --> 23:55.836
He's having a tantrum.

23:56.007 --> 23:58.014
Get lost, we're busy.

25:26.476 --> 25:29.259
You don't watch the show. Get busy.

25:29.516 --> 25:32.680
You must work. There are no kids here.

25:33.037 --> 25:36.036
You have to earn your keep.
That's enough.

25:39.917 --> 25:42.186
Little turd! You ruined my exit!

25:45.615 --> 25:47.524
Go to the trailer. Make dinner.

25:47.694 --> 25:50.923
Ladies and gentlemen,
a big hand for Louis...

25:51.086 --> 25:54.631
...the contortionist!

26:36.881 --> 26:38.604
She's so cute.

26:39.601 --> 26:41.030
How old is she?

26:41.201 --> 26:42.859
Ten.

26:43.793 --> 26:46.924
-Has she no mom, then?
-A mom? What for?

26:47.985 --> 26:49.840
Don't you ever feel lonely?

26:51.186 --> 26:53.805
You could invite me back
to your trailer for a drink.

26:55.570 --> 26:56.977
All right, come on.

27:43.348 --> 27:44.778
Do you know who I am?

27:48.437 --> 27:50.348
I'm Theresa.

27:51.830 --> 27:54.099
Are your eyes well, my angel?

27:54.902 --> 27:56.178
Yes.

27:56.662 --> 28:01.037
You're so sweet.
Who'd you like to pray for?

28:02.198 --> 28:04.052
I'll pray for Titine.

28:04.214 --> 28:07.957
Good girl. I'm watching over you.

28:08.118 --> 28:09.907
Never forget.

28:10.071 --> 28:13.300
When you're alone, I'll always be there.

28:29.496 --> 28:32.365
I've had it!
I told you to change that wheel.

28:32.536 --> 28:35.919
No discussions. Just help.
We're all in the same shit.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.884
-I don't give a damn!
-Then get lost!

28:44.729 --> 28:46.901
You can't quit. Not over a spat!

28:47.066 --> 28:50.611
Who needs a boss!
I can't stand Caroli anymore.

28:50.777 --> 28:52.981
-You're drunk!
-I'll go solo.

28:53.146 --> 28:55.927
Fat chance!
Circuses aren't on every corner.

28:56.089 --> 28:59.473
Don't worry. I always land on my feet.

29:00.250 --> 29:03.862
-You were growing on me.
-You'll get over it!

29:08.826 --> 29:11.794
Saint Theresa,
make him change his mind.

29:11.962 --> 29:14.352
I want to stay in the circus.

29:56.254 --> 29:57.714
Edith!

31:08.546 --> 31:10.237
Is the girl in the act?

31:10.530 --> 31:11.905
Just a minute.

31:12.067 --> 31:13.627
Do something.

31:14.434 --> 31:17.053
They'll leave, do something.

31:18.691 --> 31:21.725
Come on, do something.

32:15.399 --> 32:16.828
Bravo!

32:25.991 --> 32:26.939
That's my daughter!

32:41.383 --> 32:43.238
I'm fed up with carrot juice.

32:43.400 --> 32:46.913
As long as I'm your nurse,
you'll have carrot juice.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.227
I prefer it dark, Simone.

32:52.392 --> 32:55.359
It's sunny, it'll do you good.

33:05.674 --> 33:06.622
Edith...

33:06.792 --> 33:08.735
...I know it's hard...

33:08.906 --> 33:11.874
...you need lots and lots of rest...

33:12.042 --> 33:14.213
...and patience.

33:15.274 --> 33:19.430
-Your husband called today--
-It's no use.

33:20.585 --> 33:22.975
What makes me sick...

33:23.178 --> 33:25.415
...is that I overdid it.

33:27.050 --> 33:30.017
The last three years
have been disastrous.

33:30.795 --> 33:33.031
You're an artist.

33:35.851 --> 33:36.996
Simone?

33:41.579 --> 33:45.158
I won't sing again, will l?

34:12.717 --> 34:14.757
What are you looking at?

34:14.926 --> 34:16.933
I want some chow.

34:44.655 --> 34:46.795
We sing for a bit, then we eat.

34:46.958 --> 34:51.498
Singing alone's like begging.
With you, it's a show.

34:54.639 --> 34:56.362
I want to sing there.

35:06.897 --> 35:08.490
Hey, you!

35:09.072 --> 35:11.309
You can't sing in the street.

35:11.729 --> 35:12.906
Is that so?

35:13.073 --> 35:15.015
-How old are you?
-Twenty.

35:15.185 --> 35:16.941
What's that?

35:17.169 --> 35:19.625
She barely had a sip.

35:19.793 --> 35:21.255
Come here.

35:21.522 --> 35:22.951
You know "Du Gris"?

35:24.178 --> 35:25.584
Shut your trap!

35:25.746 --> 35:27.601
If you sing it, I'll let you go.

35:27.763 --> 35:31.308
My beat's over there.
I'll look the other way.

36:02.196 --> 36:06.287
Next week's the 21 st.
Sisters for five years now.

36:07.796 --> 36:10.382
Prefer working with me or the factory?

36:11.317 --> 36:14.132
I'd rather slit my throat
than work in the factory.

36:14.677 --> 36:15.756
And you?

36:15.924 --> 36:16.972
What about me?

36:17.141 --> 36:18.766
Slaving in a shitty cheese shop?

36:18.933 --> 36:22.032
Shut up! We're eating.

36:22.197 --> 36:24.685
Annetta, don't make trouble.

36:25.366 --> 36:27.570
There's your lush of a mother.

36:33.334 --> 36:34.643
Edith...

36:36.534 --> 36:38.390
Any spare change?

36:46.615 --> 36:47.728
That's it?

36:47.896 --> 36:50.798
Yep, I'm no Rockefeller, as you know.

36:50.968 --> 36:53.585
-Give me bills.
-Don't have any.

36:56.151 --> 36:57.264
I'm your mother...

36:57.432 --> 36:58.959
Get lost!

37:00.920 --> 37:02.807
Want me to sing for it?

37:02.967 --> 37:04.462
Throw her out!

37:07.032 --> 37:09.815
I'm an artist! What are you?

37:09.977 --> 37:11.319
You'll see!

37:11.481 --> 37:12.888
-You'll see!
-See what?

37:13.049 --> 37:15.318
When you're down and out!

37:15.481 --> 37:16.725
Pipe down or get out!

37:17.401 --> 37:18.830
A piece of shit!

37:19.000 --> 37:20.659
Go to hell!

37:23.033 --> 37:26.295
Don't count on your daughter
feeding you!

37:26.458 --> 37:27.702
That's enough!

37:27.866 --> 37:30.550
I'm going. You can finish my plate.

37:30.713 --> 37:34.674
-You're no singer, you shit!
-Leave her be or I'll sock you!

37:35.898 --> 37:37.905
Let's lose these bums.

37:39.418 --> 37:40.727
Eat shit!

37:40.922 --> 37:44.665
Go on and sell yourself!

37:44.827 --> 37:47.762
Hurry, your ass will soon be
too old for customers.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.508
Thanks.

38:39.678 --> 38:41.750
You'll hurt your voice that way.

38:41.918 --> 38:44.187
I have to eat, sir.

38:44.351 --> 38:46.074
Of course you do.

38:46.239 --> 38:48.955
Here, my name's Louis LeplÃ©e.

38:49.119 --> 38:51.737
My card. Be at Gerny's
tomorrow at 2 p.m.

38:51.903 --> 38:53.659
We'll see what we can do with you.

38:53.824 --> 38:55.001
You sing too?

38:55.167 --> 38:57.404
No, but I have other talents.

38:57.567 --> 39:00.284
Bring your sheet music...
Your usual songs.

39:02.687 --> 39:03.865
And if I don't?

39:06.015 --> 39:08.383
Suit yourself, sweetheart.

39:28.929 --> 39:32.442
You're out all day
and this is what you bring back?

39:32.609 --> 39:34.781
I trust you and this is it?

39:35.298 --> 39:37.884
I keep some for my father.
He's sick and broke.

39:38.050 --> 39:39.838
I'm no social worker!

39:40.002 --> 39:41.496
I swear. He's sick.

39:44.129 --> 39:47.326
I'll throw you to the street,
then you'll see!

39:47.490 --> 39:50.457
-Let her go!
-Never! Never!

39:50.626 --> 39:52.699
I'd rather croak than turn tricks.

39:53.091 --> 39:56.026
-If she dies, it's on your head!
-Shut up!

39:57.731 --> 39:59.738
I want more, understand?

39:59.907 --> 40:02.940
Or you'll spread your legs like the rest!

40:03.107 --> 40:04.601
You'll spread yours first.

40:13.348 --> 40:16.414
Albert, I'm sorry...

40:16.899 --> 40:18.875
Stay, please stay!

40:19.044 --> 40:20.605
Drop that asshole.

40:25.509 --> 40:28.029
Etienne, give her a drink.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.908
-Coming to the Chinaman's?
-Who's going?

40:32.069 --> 40:34.076
The two wops, Fats and Pops.

40:34.822 --> 40:37.123
There'll be lots of coke and poppy.

40:37.285 --> 40:39.424
How about some human warmth...

40:39.589 --> 40:41.891
Because I screwed you once...

40:42.054 --> 40:44.127
...doesn't mean I'll do it again.

40:44.294 --> 40:46.628
-Get it?
-Give me a break.

40:46.790 --> 40:48.350
You know what?

40:48.518 --> 40:51.933
I don't give a shit
about all that, know why?

40:52.103 --> 40:54.339
No? Too dense?

40:54.502 --> 40:57.219
Because I'm an artiste.

40:57.382 --> 40:59.618
I'm going to the top! I know it.

40:59.782 --> 41:01.693
I've always known it!

41:04.711 --> 41:06.369
It's the little flame.

41:06.535 --> 41:10.691
Saint Theresa, I see great things.

41:16.808 --> 41:20.420
Look at her clothes. She looks sick.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.375
Where did he dig her up?

41:39.241 --> 41:41.030
She's incredible.

41:42.377 --> 41:43.555
Philipo, champagne.

41:43.913 --> 41:45.506
The boss is in love.

41:45.674 --> 41:47.300
She's got lung power.

41:52.426 --> 41:54.313
The kid's all right, my Louis.

41:54.473 --> 41:56.678
Don't be jealous, Josette.

42:24.331 --> 42:25.608
Tell me your name again.

42:25.772 --> 42:27.714
Edith Giovanna Gassion.

42:28.780 --> 42:29.729
That's not great.

42:29.900 --> 42:31.842
I have other names:

42:32.012 --> 42:34.882
Huguette Helias, Tania...

42:36.109 --> 42:38.214
-Denise Jay.
-Jay...

42:38.380 --> 42:40.136
You get manicures!

42:40.685 --> 42:42.573
Don't change the subject.

42:44.430 --> 42:45.956
You're like a bird.

42:46.541 --> 42:47.883
You think so?

42:48.045 --> 42:49.125
Really?

42:49.293 --> 42:50.886
Is "Little Songbird" taken?

42:51.054 --> 42:52.461
Yes, it's taken.

42:53.422 --> 42:55.048
A sparrow...

42:55.214 --> 42:57.734
You call a sparrow a piaf?

42:58.030 --> 43:00.365
Is that what you say? Piaf?

43:02.030 --> 43:04.299
-The Little Sparrow.
-Great!

43:04.463 --> 43:07.495
-That's corny.
-What do you know?

43:07.663 --> 43:10.346
-The Little Sparrow.
-That's great!

43:10.511 --> 43:13.478
You need some classics
worthy of your name.

43:13.646 --> 43:15.502
Bruant's "Les MÃ´mes de la Cloche."

43:15.664 --> 43:16.972
I know that one.

43:17.135 --> 43:19.785
Rehearse around the clock if need be.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.348
You start on Friday.

43:24.880 --> 43:26.571
The show's about to begin.

43:26.736 --> 43:27.979
Check on your protÃ©gÃ©e.

43:28.145 --> 43:29.901
-Why?
-She's quite a drinker.

43:30.065 --> 43:31.591
I'm on my way.

43:34.032 --> 43:35.014
Philipo...

43:35.184 --> 43:37.224
...no more alcohol backstage.

43:43.697 --> 43:45.104
What are you doing?

43:45.265 --> 43:47.502
I didn't finish knitting it.

43:47.665 --> 43:49.934
-I'm making a sleeve.
-Now!

43:50.098 --> 43:52.202
-It's sold out.
-All the more reason.

43:52.369 --> 43:54.344
She can't go on like a bum!

43:54.513 --> 43:58.889
She can't sing looking like a bum.
Your star is dressing your new singer.

43:59.058 --> 44:00.400
Yes, absolutely.

44:00.562 --> 44:02.504
-Girls, hurry.
-Yes.

44:02.673 --> 44:04.496
I'm gonna barf.

44:04.658 --> 44:07.211
Some other time. Quickly, now.

44:11.634 --> 44:14.221
A few days ago, on my way home...

44:14.386 --> 44:18.610
...perhaps luck or fate led me
to tonight's performer.

44:18.995 --> 44:21.361
Here she is, as I first saw her...

44:21.523 --> 44:23.662
...a diamond in the rough.

44:23.828 --> 44:27.602
From the sidewalk to Gerny's:
The Little Sparrow.

45:52.953 --> 45:54.808
She's like my sister.

46:14.458 --> 46:15.767
Did I lie?

46:15.930 --> 46:17.937
She's sensational.

47:06.365 --> 47:08.569
Meet the venerable Jean Mermoz.

47:09.853 --> 47:11.828
This is for you.

47:12.701 --> 47:14.011
Thank you.

47:14.174 --> 47:15.635
Come, Edith.

47:16.574 --> 47:19.640
You wowed them, you'll do it
tomorrow and every night.

47:19.807 --> 47:22.588
You must meet someone
who'll help you.

47:27.230 --> 47:30.100
My name's Marguerite Monnot.
I'm a pianist.

47:30.271 --> 47:33.468
If ever you need,
I'd love to compose for you.

47:33.759 --> 47:34.774
Thank you.

47:34.943 --> 47:36.317
Come.

47:36.671 --> 47:37.751
Edith...

47:37.919 --> 47:40.090
...this is Mr. Jacques Canetti.

47:40.256 --> 47:42.198
Artistic Director of City Radio.

47:42.367 --> 47:45.019
Miss, you completely dazzled me.

47:45.440 --> 47:46.520
Thank you.

47:46.688 --> 47:48.598
Please join us at our table.

47:48.768 --> 47:52.249
-I can't stay. I have to run.
-What's so important?

47:54.592 --> 47:55.737
Thank you.

47:55.904 --> 47:56.886
What is it?

47:57.280 --> 47:59.223
Marvelous, marvelous.

48:07.233 --> 48:09.208
You better lay off, or it's pow...

48:09.889 --> 48:11.296
...right in the kisser!

48:11.457 --> 48:14.327
You dimwit,
we've been waiting an hour!

48:14.498 --> 48:16.800
Fuck off, you stingy bastard!

48:36.226 --> 48:37.721
THE SPARROW

48:37.891 --> 48:40.445
RECORD OF THE MONTH

48:40.612 --> 48:43.394
AT GERNY'S
ASTOUNDING

48:47.236 --> 48:49.790
Interview with Louis LeplÃ©e

48:49.956 --> 48:53.153
LeplÃ©e introduces Edith Gassion,
a.k.a. "The Sparrow"

48:53.316 --> 48:55.138
Owner of famous cabaret
"Le Gerny's"

49:12.261 --> 49:13.242
Miss...

49:13.414 --> 49:15.203
...you're marvelous.

49:16.133 --> 49:18.785
My hand's going to fall off.

49:18.949 --> 49:20.324
Have more bubbly.

49:20.486 --> 49:22.461
I want the bottle!

49:22.950 --> 49:25.372
Here. I told her to trust me.

49:25.542 --> 49:28.096
That's the power of radio,
right, Coquatrix?

49:28.262 --> 49:30.564
Don't forget the magic of music hall.

49:30.727 --> 49:31.675
Of course.

49:31.846 --> 49:34.214
Edith, I have something for you.

49:34.375 --> 49:36.131
-A song?
-Naturally.

49:36.614 --> 49:37.858
Raymond! Raymond!

49:38.631 --> 49:40.540
Mireille, call Raymond.

49:42.023 --> 49:43.517
Someone for you, Kid.

49:43.687 --> 49:46.076
Someone for you, Kid.

49:49.383 --> 49:51.359
The big guy wants to talk to you.

49:52.615 --> 49:54.950
This is Raymond Asso...

49:55.111 --> 49:58.428
...writer, composer, performer, poet.

49:59.400 --> 50:02.215
-I'll be back.
-I love your music.

50:02.377 --> 50:05.694
Yeah, I don't like your mug.

50:10.633 --> 50:12.804
I've seen you often.

50:13.642 --> 50:15.168
You must've been hiding.

50:16.714 --> 50:18.656
It's midnight, everyone up.

50:18.825 --> 50:20.254
Everyone stand up!

50:37.323 --> 50:39.177
You're an immense artist.

50:39.338 --> 50:41.411
I'm wearing high heels.

50:46.827 --> 50:48.453
Whenever you'd like...

50:48.619 --> 50:50.441
Call me. I'll be waiting.

51:10.061 --> 51:12.297
My Daddy LeplÃ©e!

51:12.972 --> 51:16.322
A toast to my Daddy LeplÃ©e,
my savior!

52:25.970 --> 52:29.483
What about yesterday?
Were you in, or...

52:29.649 --> 52:31.657
I was here, but didn't see him.

53:09.428 --> 53:12.276
You're a bird of ill omen!

53:17.269 --> 53:19.211
It's her fault!

53:25.621 --> 53:27.596
Are you the Little Sparrow?

53:29.717 --> 53:31.691
Follow me, please.

53:31.862 --> 53:32.974
What for?

53:33.141 --> 53:34.864
This way.

53:35.030 --> 53:37.102
Let me through, please.

53:37.270 --> 53:38.318
This way.

53:39.637 --> 53:41.132
I'm talking to you!

53:41.302 --> 53:43.757
-Are you mixed up with the Mob?
-No.

53:45.430 --> 53:46.510
Leave me alone.

53:46.679 --> 53:48.239
What about Henri Valette?

53:48.406 --> 53:51.189
And Georges,
Johnny the sailor and Albert...

53:51.351 --> 53:52.877
...never heard of them either?

53:53.046 --> 53:55.764
They're friends.
They're not mixed up in this.

53:56.471 --> 53:58.992
Aiding and abetting is a crime.

53:59.160 --> 54:02.193
I'm not guilty! I didn't do anything!

54:02.359 --> 54:03.701
I've lost everything.

54:03.863 --> 54:05.292
Where were you last night?

54:05.464 --> 54:08.563
I told you, I was out partying...

54:09.880 --> 54:11.789
You scum, lousy rats!

54:11.960 --> 54:13.999
What you're doing is disgusting!

54:14.167 --> 54:15.793
This isn't the stage!

54:15.961 --> 54:19.735
It seems you have
some unsavory friends, like Albert.

54:19.896 --> 54:22.417
I don't know any of them, inspector.

54:22.585 --> 54:24.440
Sure. I wasn't born yesterday.

54:26.969 --> 54:29.173
-Miss Piaf, a word?
-A photo, please.

54:29.337 --> 54:31.704
She deserves to be shamed!

54:31.865 --> 54:34.232
You just go back to the gutter
you came from!

54:34.393 --> 54:36.335
Leave her alone! She's innocent.

54:36.505 --> 54:38.066
Got that?

54:38.234 --> 54:39.695
Did you turn anyone in?

54:39.866 --> 54:42.255
This is a funeral. Show some restraint.

54:46.138 --> 54:49.815
-One more question.
-Stop stirring shit. Move!

54:50.362 --> 54:51.955
Out of the way, all of you!

54:52.121 --> 54:54.010
That's it. I'm as good as dead.

54:54.427 --> 54:57.394
They dragged me through the mud.

54:58.458 --> 55:00.598
Forget it. It's old news.

55:00.987 --> 55:02.612
I didn't do anything!

55:02.778 --> 55:03.727
I know.

55:06.492 --> 55:08.085
Open up.

55:16.476 --> 55:18.647
-What?
-Simone Berteaut?

55:19.772 --> 55:20.852
Yes.

55:21.020 --> 55:24.184
Miss Berteaut, you must come with us.

55:24.508 --> 55:26.264
What for?

55:26.428 --> 55:29.276
Court order from the judge
and your mother to send you...

55:29.437 --> 55:31.509
...to a girls' detention home.

55:31.678 --> 55:34.198
Effective immediately.

55:34.364 --> 55:36.023
Get your things, please.

55:36.188 --> 55:38.229
It's not true. She stays here!

55:38.398 --> 55:40.601
I have nothing to say to you.

55:41.246 --> 55:44.027
For the last time, get your things.

55:45.886 --> 55:47.708
You want to kill me!

55:47.870 --> 55:49.844
You want to kill me, is that it?

55:51.294 --> 55:52.887
Let me go, I said.

55:53.053 --> 55:54.395
She's not leaving.

55:54.558 --> 55:58.268
-Momone!
-Edith, don't let them take me!

56:00.127 --> 56:02.167
My things! I have nothing!

56:02.335 --> 56:04.440
You hear, you bastard?

56:04.606 --> 56:08.153
Momone, no!

56:16.544 --> 56:18.366
Daddy LeplÃ©e.

56:21.024 --> 56:24.286
Oh, Daddy LeplÃ©e!

56:32.769 --> 56:35.224
You killed him! Where's the dough?

56:37.569 --> 56:40.384
What do you expect from a former slut?

57:20.804 --> 57:23.324
Everyone out of my dressing room!

57:23.492 --> 57:25.281
Mamie, stay.

57:31.557 --> 57:34.655
I need a shot, it hurts too bad.

57:59.846 --> 58:02.017
Call the American.

58:06.375 --> 58:08.829
You can come in now.

58:13.447 --> 58:15.684
What a triumph. It was divine.

58:15.848 --> 58:17.309
Doug...

58:19.591 --> 58:21.151
I need some air.

58:21.319 --> 58:24.581
I want to go back to Chalons, with you.

58:27.431 --> 58:29.373
It's four hundred kilometers away.

58:30.759 --> 58:32.734
Go to hell, all of you!

58:32.905 --> 58:34.498
I've had it with you all!

58:34.664 --> 58:37.511
You're exhausted. It's a long journey.

58:37.673 --> 58:41.350
It's always "no" this and "no" that.
To hell with that!

58:59.465 --> 59:00.774
Let's go back.

59:00.937 --> 59:03.043
Turn around.

59:03.210 --> 59:06.439
Turn around! You spoiled it for me!

59:20.299 --> 59:22.209
Her blood tests are catastrophic.

59:22.379 --> 59:24.681
She has two broken ribs we can't set.

59:24.843 --> 59:26.632
It'll take weeks.

59:26.795 --> 59:31.050
If she has engagements, cancel them.

59:39.436 --> 59:41.640
It's tight enough. Get away.

59:41.964 --> 59:44.714
Doctor, give me a shot so I can sing.

59:44.877 --> 59:47.976
Sorry, but my admiration has limits.

59:48.717 --> 59:51.335
Theirs has no limits, neither do l.

59:51.501 --> 59:54.185
Cancel. You're playing with your life.

59:54.349 --> 59:57.731
So? You have to play with something.

59:57.901 --> 01:00:00.967
You want a new life? Get a new you.

01:00:01.294 --> 01:00:03.433
-New what?
-New you.

01:00:04.462 --> 01:00:06.317
Why didn't you call sooner?

01:00:06.894 --> 01:00:10.472
I was busy. I didn't know
what you wanted with me.

01:00:10.639 --> 01:00:13.934
I saw you sing. You've a lot to learn.

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:16.586
You're the first to say so.

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:20.938
In three months no one will call
you Kid. Cabaret life's over.

01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:31.566
Like-a-storm-in-the-night! Articulate!

01:00:31.824 --> 01:00:33.198
Again!

01:00:36.496 --> 01:00:39.595
"He had bright blue eyes"!

01:00:39.759 --> 01:00:41.418
Are they words or sounds?

01:00:41.584 --> 01:00:44.267
-What do you want?
-Perfect diction!

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:46.374
I sing the way I speak!

01:00:46.544 --> 01:00:48.071
Badly.

01:00:48.368 --> 01:00:52.460
You slur the words,
and you don't understand them.

01:00:54.385 --> 01:00:55.563
Slower, Marguerite.

01:00:55.728 --> 01:00:57.867
It's been 6 hours.
Can we open a window?

01:00:58.034 --> 01:00:59.856
We'll breathe later.

01:01:00.593 --> 01:01:01.902
Again.

01:01:09.521 --> 01:01:13.067
You don't listen!
You're not living the song.

01:01:14.163 --> 01:01:17.512
You have to be that woman in love.

01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:20.073
Think like an actress.

01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:24.688
He's mocking me.

01:01:24.851 --> 01:01:27.752
We're tired. We need a break.

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.074
He makes me feel like I can't sing.

01:01:32.243 --> 01:01:34.611
Who do you think you are?

01:01:35.315 --> 01:01:37.869
You can't rest on your laurels.

01:01:38.387 --> 01:01:40.559
I started singing at 9!

01:01:40.724 --> 01:01:44.466
It's okay. Don't worry.
This is new and difficult.

01:01:44.851 --> 01:01:47.121
You must become a performer,
understand?

01:01:47.764 --> 01:01:49.674
Live the song!

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.809
No one ever minded my diction.

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:56.013
No one... Like who?

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:59.211
Creeps at Gerny's or on the street?

01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:10.382
Do what I say or go back to the gutter.

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:18.030
Edith!

01:02:25.143 --> 01:02:28.274
To my little girl
who never forgot her daddy.

01:02:28.439 --> 01:02:30.381
-To the Kid!
-To the Kid!

01:02:30.551 --> 01:02:33.202
Heard you got a mentor.
Does he have bucks?

01:02:33.591 --> 01:02:35.981
Not a cent... It's art for art's sake.

01:02:36.151 --> 01:02:38.387
Art for your ass' sake.

01:02:38.551 --> 01:02:40.756
Come on, Kid, sing something.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.025
Give us a song!

01:03:32.987 --> 01:03:35.441
That's the way to handle her.

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:38.038
I let her get away.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:41.972
I was too good to her!

01:04:06.397 --> 01:04:09.266
You're stiff as a poker. Lifeless.

01:04:09.437 --> 01:04:11.641
Like a champ brawling in the street.

01:04:11.805 --> 01:04:13.715
Performing is an art.

01:04:14.302 --> 01:04:16.855
Grab them with all you've got.

01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:19.163
You have great hands.

01:04:19.325 --> 01:04:20.700
Use them.

01:04:20.862 --> 01:04:22.204
Sing with them.

01:04:22.366 --> 01:04:23.926
Again, Marguerite.

01:04:28.478 --> 01:04:30.071
Put some life in it.

01:04:31.806 --> 01:04:32.886
Your hands, your hands.

01:04:36.862 --> 01:04:38.171
That's it.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.588
-I feel stupid.
-Keep going.

01:04:52.415 --> 01:04:53.909
Put this on.

01:04:54.752 --> 01:04:58.232
People don't care about that.
They like my voice.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.913
How can you be so talented
and so pig-headed?

01:05:27.554 --> 01:05:29.791
-Open up.
-I'm going to throw up!

01:05:29.953 --> 01:05:31.448
What's up, is she drunk?

01:05:31.617 --> 01:05:33.308
No, she's panicking.

01:05:34.914 --> 01:05:37.303
The audience is waiting!

01:05:39.842 --> 01:05:41.731
For weeks you bugged me
for this show.

01:05:41.891 --> 01:05:45.720
Get her on stage before there's a riot!

01:05:45.891 --> 01:05:47.451
She's coming.

01:05:48.484 --> 01:05:49.431
Edith...

01:05:49.923 --> 01:05:51.647
You have three minutes.

01:05:51.811 --> 01:05:55.324
This isn't a cabaret, it's a music hall.

01:05:55.491 --> 01:05:57.859
What have I gotten myself into?

01:05:58.628 --> 01:06:02.108
It's stage fright. It's a good sign.

01:06:06.787 --> 01:06:08.249
Edith?

01:06:09.093 --> 01:06:10.500
What?

01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:13.313
This is it.

01:06:13.477 --> 01:06:15.680
This is what we've worked for.

01:06:15.844 --> 01:06:18.016
You can't crack up now.

01:06:20.325 --> 01:06:21.733
Open this door.

01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:25.564
No, I can't.

01:06:27.333 --> 01:06:29.123
Open it, please.

01:06:32.678 --> 01:06:34.140
Stand up.

01:09:17.104 --> 01:09:19.526
Ladies and gentlemen, Edith Piaf!

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:29.228
EDITH PIAF
triumphs!

01:09:29.393 --> 01:09:31.279
STREET SINGER
MAKES IT BIG

01:09:31.826 --> 01:09:33.484
THE LITTLE SPARROW
Premieres

01:09:36.113 --> 01:09:38.185
"The first Man to give me a hand...

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:41.703
PIAF
ON TOUR

01:09:47.761 --> 01:09:49.737
EDITH PIAF's tour
at the A.B.C. Theater

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:07.438
The Sparrow's Dead.
Long Live Edith Piaf!

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.685
Know what it's like to hurry home...

01:10:24.852 --> 01:10:27.089
...hoping to lean on the one you love...

01:10:27.285 --> 01:10:29.172
...only to find an empty room.

01:10:29.333 --> 01:10:31.024
Waiting and waiting.

01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:33.294
I know that empty room. Yes, I do.

01:10:33.461 --> 01:10:35.152
I can't wait to see you in the play.

01:10:35.317 --> 01:10:36.265
Paris, February 14, 1940

01:10:36.436 --> 01:10:37.746
Heads up, Canetti's coming.

01:10:37.909 --> 01:10:41.226
The conductor has been
waiting three hours.

01:10:41.398 --> 01:10:44.398
-So?
-The premiere's in less than 48 hours.

01:10:44.566 --> 01:10:48.111
Know many people
Cocteau has written plays for?

01:10:48.886 --> 01:10:50.577
-Miss?
-Yes, Suzanne.

01:10:50.742 --> 01:10:54.572
Paul Meurisse called.
Dinner with Mr. Cocteau is at 8:00 p.m.

01:10:54.742 --> 01:10:56.303
You see.

01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:58.379
Ask him to come back at midnight.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:59.794
Are you sure?

01:10:59.958 --> 01:11:03.024
You're worse than Raymond.
Do this, do that.

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:05.459
-Stop it.
-She fired that pain in the ass!

01:11:05.622 --> 01:11:06.735
Stop it.

01:11:06.903 --> 01:11:08.626
Shall I show you the gowns?

01:11:08.791 --> 01:11:10.384
Yes, the gowns.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.370
They're all here, Miss Piaf.

01:11:20.535 --> 01:11:22.423
Careful of the pins.

01:11:22.584 --> 01:11:25.235
The simplest one, no collar.

01:11:28.311 --> 01:11:31.279
A man's been calling...
He has something for you.

01:11:31.448 --> 01:11:33.237
-What's he like?
-A soldier.

01:11:33.401 --> 01:11:37.808
I said you couldn't see him.
He's on the landing. It's awkward.

01:11:37.977 --> 01:11:40.344
Since he's here, show him in.

01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:49.616
Follow me.

01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:52.273
Put it there.

01:11:56.730 --> 01:12:00.505
-Here she is.
-Much better with no collar.

01:12:01.082 --> 01:12:02.609
Well...

01:12:02.778 --> 01:12:05.462
My name's Michel Emer,
I'm a corporal.

01:12:05.627 --> 01:12:08.823
This isn't the army.
What do you want?

01:12:12.059 --> 01:12:13.434
I have a song for you.

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:15.962
Another? I have plenty.

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:18.359
I premiere at the Bobino in two days.

01:12:18.523 --> 01:12:19.931
I'll take this one.

01:12:20.092 --> 01:12:22.264
I go to the front tomorrow.

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.664
There's the piano.
You have five minutes.

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:34.676
Edith...

01:12:37.213 --> 01:12:39.122
We'll have to wait.

01:13:15.294 --> 01:13:16.855
Stop.

01:13:18.622 --> 01:13:20.248
I want it.

01:13:20.416 --> 01:13:21.789
Everybody out.

01:13:23.744 --> 01:13:26.493
You can't do this. We're already late.

01:13:26.655 --> 01:13:28.117
What can't she do?

01:13:28.288 --> 01:13:31.157
Play it. I want it for the Bobino.

01:13:31.328 --> 01:13:32.735
Get moving.

01:13:34.657 --> 01:13:37.689
-You can't do this.
-I can't?

01:13:37.857 --> 01:13:40.639
Then what's the point
of being Edith Piaf?

01:13:48.193 --> 01:13:49.535
In French, please.

01:13:49.697 --> 01:13:52.315
"She's too desperate, too poor..."

01:13:52.481 --> 01:13:53.975
Spit it out, Charles.

01:13:54.145 --> 01:13:55.094
I'm not a translator.

01:13:56.385 --> 01:14:02.049
"Pathetic. Not in the tradition
of the French Cancan and Gay Paris.

01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:03.552
A complete flop."

01:14:03.714 --> 01:14:07.260
It's not the first time
you've had to fight.

01:14:07.425 --> 01:14:10.687
Americans want beauties, not me.

01:14:10.851 --> 01:14:13.665
I'm not the Parisian
bombshell they expected.

01:14:13.826 --> 01:14:15.737
Can you see me as a chorus girl?

01:14:15.907 --> 01:14:18.777
Where's my feather up the ass!

01:14:25.475 --> 01:14:27.963
Go on, laugh. I don't connect to them.

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:30.042
They think I'm sad, they're dumb.

01:14:30.211 --> 01:14:31.772
Yeah, too dumb.

01:14:40.675 --> 01:14:43.196
-You're on the front page.
-Two columns.

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:01.116
It's Greek to me, translate this shit.

01:15:01.284 --> 01:15:04.547
He says they shouldn't let you go.

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:06.717
It would be a grave mistake.

01:15:06.886 --> 01:15:10.202
The Americans don't deserve you.

01:15:10.374 --> 01:15:13.408
I knew something would happen!
I must get changed.

01:15:13.702 --> 01:15:15.972
Ginou, help me choose a dress.

01:15:17.574 --> 01:15:20.870
Tonight I'm going out. I have a date.

01:15:34.311 --> 01:15:35.326
What's this, Marcel?

01:15:35.495 --> 01:15:37.283
Beef... Go on, taste it.

01:15:40.232 --> 01:15:42.054
It smells like a wet dog.

01:15:45.737 --> 01:15:46.685
What?

01:15:53.032 --> 01:15:54.820
Your English is as good as the meat.

01:16:02.505 --> 01:16:04.361
Don't like the place?

01:16:05.129 --> 01:16:07.650
I'm a bit surprised. I didn't expect...

01:16:08.713 --> 01:16:11.365
When you called
to invite me out and said...

01:16:11.529 --> 01:16:13.471
...we were two Frenchies
alone in New York...

01:16:13.642 --> 01:16:16.228
...why not go out to eat...

01:16:16.394 --> 01:16:18.216
... I imagined something different.

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.289
It's my local spot.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:26.786
You sure know how to spoil a girl.

01:16:40.844 --> 01:16:44.193
-Two pastrami sandwiches...
-Oh, no!

01:16:44.364 --> 01:16:47.180
I'll handle this.
Two tournedos Rossini...

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:52.101
...and a bottle of ChÃ¢teau
AngÃ©lus 1938, please.

01:16:55.981 --> 01:16:57.290
You must be starving.

01:16:57.997 --> 01:17:00.168
Better that than boiled dog meat.

01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:02.570
I'm sorry.

01:17:03.054 --> 01:17:05.093
Let's start over. Okay?

01:17:07.406 --> 01:17:09.610
How long have you been in New York?

01:17:10.221 --> 01:17:11.945
Eight weeks.

01:17:12.109 --> 01:17:13.124
Do you like America?

01:17:14.381 --> 01:17:16.291
I couldn't care less about America.

01:17:16.461 --> 01:17:18.950
I don't get them,
and they don't get me.

01:17:19.118 --> 01:17:21.420
-You must miss Paris.
-Terribly.

01:17:21.582 --> 01:17:24.168
What do you do
when you're not singing?

01:17:24.942 --> 01:17:28.772
You could be a police investigator.

01:17:28.942 --> 01:17:30.088
I knit.

01:17:30.862 --> 01:17:33.645
Tell me your size,
I'll knit you a sweater.

01:17:33.807 --> 01:17:35.979
No, thanks, really...

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:39.845
Those people recognized you.

01:17:40.015 --> 01:17:41.292
Really?

01:17:43.791 --> 01:17:48.581
They're saying that chump lost
his last two fights. He's washed up.

01:17:48.752 --> 01:17:51.533
-I'll shut them up good.
-No!

01:17:52.144 --> 01:17:55.079
Don't get worked up. I was kidding.

01:18:06.736 --> 01:18:08.166
Very good.

01:18:18.418 --> 01:18:19.846
Let's not be so formal.

01:18:20.018 --> 01:18:21.512
Of course...

01:18:22.034 --> 01:18:23.823
And when you're not boxing?

01:18:23.986 --> 01:18:25.895
I train, I run...

01:18:26.066 --> 01:18:27.179
And after training?

01:18:27.346 --> 01:18:30.662
When I'm home in Morocco,
I work on my farm.

01:18:31.346 --> 01:18:33.256
You have a farm!

01:18:33.778 --> 01:18:35.502
I raise pigs.

01:18:40.147 --> 01:18:42.252
What? Why not?

01:18:45.332 --> 01:18:46.794
It's true, why not?

01:18:46.964 --> 01:18:50.313
It's a lovely farm.
Very modern, with fine, fat pigs.

01:18:50.547 --> 01:18:51.977
Who works it when you box?

01:18:52.148 --> 01:18:53.523
My wife.

01:19:01.556 --> 01:19:02.985
You have...

01:19:04.117 --> 01:19:05.523
...magnificent hands.

01:19:07.957 --> 01:19:09.648
Did you hear that, Momone?

01:19:09.813 --> 01:19:12.017
You do have nice fingers.

01:19:13.622 --> 01:19:14.995
Listen.

01:19:15.157 --> 01:19:17.099
What color are your eyes?

01:19:17.621 --> 01:19:20.043
He leaned over to have a closer look.

01:19:20.214 --> 01:19:21.588
And his breath stunk!

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:23.059
You can be such a jerk.

01:19:23.222 --> 01:19:25.077
He is a pig farmer, after all.

01:19:25.238 --> 01:19:26.253
He said...

01:19:26.422 --> 01:19:28.113
Violet blue.

01:19:28.279 --> 01:19:30.253
Of course, violet blue.

01:19:30.422 --> 01:19:32.396
It was the way he said it.

01:19:32.694 --> 01:19:34.669
He seemed like a child.

01:19:35.927 --> 01:19:37.552
Then he said...

01:19:37.719 --> 01:19:39.508
You look like a fairy.

01:19:40.599 --> 01:19:42.901
That's a bit much.

01:20:10.777 --> 01:20:12.119
Did you kiss him?

01:20:12.697 --> 01:20:14.388
I didn't dare.

01:20:15.545 --> 01:20:18.579
-It was a very lovely evening.
-Too short.

01:20:21.209 --> 01:20:23.097
Will you watch me fight?

01:20:23.258 --> 01:20:25.200
Of course.

01:20:26.938 --> 01:20:29.327
Did he try to kiss you?

01:20:29.754 --> 01:20:32.023
Don't know if it crossed his mind.

01:20:32.826 --> 01:20:34.288
Yeah, sure. I believe that.

01:20:34.458 --> 01:20:35.920
I'll come hear you sing.

01:20:39.194 --> 01:20:42.097
Well... Good night.

01:20:46.235 --> 01:20:48.123
He's the love of my life!

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.866
You were wonderful!

01:22:20.032 --> 01:22:24.222
Mr. Lucien Roupp,
who is Mr. Cerdan's manager.

01:22:24.385 --> 01:22:25.759
Mr. Jameson...

01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:27.929
...from CBS television network...

01:22:42.370 --> 01:22:43.930
Marlene...

01:22:46.755 --> 01:22:50.977
Good evening. I'm sorry.
I simply wanted to have a word.

01:22:53.251 --> 01:22:56.033
I haven't been to Paris for ages.

01:22:56.323 --> 01:22:59.738
But this evening,
when you were singing, Edith...

01:22:59.907 --> 01:23:01.761
...I was there...

01:23:02.051 --> 01:23:04.440
...in the streets, beneath its sky.

01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:08.351
Your voice is the soul of Paris.

01:23:08.516 --> 01:23:10.588
You took me on a journey.

01:23:10.756 --> 01:23:12.643
You made me cry.

01:23:13.796 --> 01:23:16.349
Thank you,
from the bottom of my heart.

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:18.461
Thank you.

01:23:55.111 --> 01:23:56.485
Come on up.

01:24:02.695 --> 01:24:04.997
I'm starting to like this city.

01:24:05.191 --> 01:24:07.493
The stars are out tonight.

01:24:07.879 --> 01:24:09.188
Let's go.

01:24:24.075 --> 01:24:25.154
Marc...

01:24:25.322 --> 01:24:27.712
...do you know how long a frog lives?

01:24:29.131 --> 01:24:30.986
In fairy tales or in life?

01:24:33.547 --> 01:24:37.442
I've never read fairy tales...
To anyone.

01:24:37.675 --> 01:24:39.814
You haven't had the opportunity.

01:24:41.131 --> 01:24:44.426
Yes, but I didn't do it.

01:26:13.841 --> 01:26:15.248
Excuse me. I'm a bit tired.

01:26:17.329 --> 01:26:18.376
I'll be back.

01:26:37.714 --> 01:26:39.624
Lay her down there.

01:26:47.059 --> 01:26:49.547
-I'm going back.
-It's out of the question.

01:26:49.715 --> 01:26:51.722
Nobody tells me when to stop!

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.447
What do we do?

01:26:53.619 --> 01:26:55.889
I'm sorry. Have everyone leave.

01:26:56.435 --> 01:26:58.540
-I'm going back!
-No, Edith!

01:26:58.708 --> 01:27:01.260
-I must go on.
-It's suicide.

01:27:01.428 --> 01:27:03.184
She must be hospitalized.

01:27:04.532 --> 01:27:07.467
No! Louis, I'm begging you!

01:27:07.636 --> 01:27:10.320
You were just in the hospital
three weeks ago.

01:27:10.484 --> 01:27:12.787
There will be other galas.

01:27:13.237 --> 01:27:16.499
Take me back on stage!

01:27:16.948 --> 01:27:19.054
Take me back. I must sing!

01:27:19.221 --> 01:27:22.418
I must sing, Louis. I have no choice!

01:27:23.254 --> 01:27:25.971
Edith, please...

01:27:26.517 --> 01:27:29.267
-Do you hear them?
-Stop...

01:27:30.326 --> 01:27:31.701
Close that door!

01:27:32.246 --> 01:27:33.773
Take me back, Louis.

01:27:34.326 --> 01:27:38.321
Take me back.
If I don't sing tonight...

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:41.170
If I don't sing at least one song...

01:27:41.335 --> 01:27:45.459
...I'll lose all faith in myself.
Do you understand?

01:27:59.703 --> 01:28:01.197
Doctor...

01:28:02.616 --> 01:28:04.307
...do what you must.

01:28:29.465 --> 01:28:32.814
Not this time, you guys.

01:28:32.986 --> 01:28:36.248
You expect me to fall on my face,
I'm in great shape.

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:39.607
Tell your papers
it's not my suicide tour!

01:28:44.347 --> 01:28:45.721
"Padam."

01:30:12.704 --> 01:30:15.005
Saint Theresa,
first of all, thank you...

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.321
I know you're behind all this.

01:30:19.488 --> 01:30:21.855
You sent him to me.

01:30:22.433 --> 01:30:26.459
I've found love,
and I know it's your doing.

01:30:26.817 --> 01:30:30.298
Sweet Jesus, protect Marcel.

01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:45.317
Go, Marcel!

01:31:46.981 --> 01:31:48.258
Go now!

01:31:48.422 --> 01:31:49.829
It's too soon, Edith.

01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:51.965
No, he'll win. I feel it.

01:31:52.134 --> 01:31:54.272
-If there's a problem, you'll look bad.
-What problem?

01:31:56.807 --> 01:31:59.556
If there's a problem,
I'll call you. Now go.

01:32:11.528 --> 01:32:12.804
Hurry up!

01:32:28.168 --> 01:32:29.794
Go, Marcel!

01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:47.809
One round!

01:33:02.282 --> 01:33:03.711
Go on, Marcel!

01:33:08.299 --> 01:33:09.706
Kill him!

01:33:46.637 --> 01:33:49.125
-What's happening?
-Zale's injured.

01:34:16.494 --> 01:34:18.862
He did it? He's world champion!

01:35:18.419 --> 01:35:20.329
You look like an angel.

01:35:22.195 --> 01:35:24.431
Not like a fairy anymore?

01:35:31.028 --> 01:35:32.588
You are my champion.

01:35:32.756 --> 01:35:35.505
I want you to be mine for life.

01:35:35.861 --> 01:35:39.308
Nothing existed before you.
It's all gone.

01:35:43.541 --> 01:35:45.396
Stay with me.

01:35:49.524 --> 01:35:53.551
My beloved, yesterday before bed,
I crossed off a day...

01:35:53.717 --> 01:35:56.783
...a long day, but also short.

01:35:56.949 --> 01:36:00.113
When the plane took off
it took with it my heart...

01:36:00.278 --> 01:36:02.580
...my life, my breath...

01:36:02.742 --> 01:36:06.038
My sweet boy, my child, my love...

01:36:06.198 --> 01:36:07.692
...your scent lingers in my sheets...

01:36:07.862 --> 01:36:10.829
...and my heart sleeps incessantly...

01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:13.202
...in the arms of sadness.

01:36:13.365 --> 01:36:14.380
My Darling...

01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:17.867
...I love you. What have you done
to put me in this state?

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:19.151
I miss you.

01:36:19.319 --> 01:36:23.629
I'm blank, listless
as though waiting for something...

01:36:23.799 --> 01:36:25.741
Hold me tight against your heart...

01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:30.286
...and know nothing in the world
counts more than you.

01:36:30.455 --> 01:36:32.877
Return my heart to me.

01:36:33.048 --> 01:36:35.502
I think the French know about us.

01:36:35.672 --> 01:36:38.934
When I'm in a restaurant,
they play "La Vie en Rose"...

01:36:40.055 --> 01:36:42.161
When I see, my love...

01:36:42.328 --> 01:36:46.386
...how attached you are
to your wife and your three children...

01:36:46.552 --> 01:36:48.724
...I feel like going far away...

01:36:48.888 --> 01:36:53.264
...thinking someday
you'll be grateful to me.

01:36:53.433 --> 01:36:57.711
I can't have you all for myself,
and can't live without you.

01:36:57.882 --> 01:37:01.264
God is my witness,
in this affair I ask for nothing...

01:37:01.433 --> 01:37:04.117
...and am willing to sacrifice all.

01:37:06.073 --> 01:37:08.310
If one day life tears you from me...

01:37:08.505 --> 01:37:10.361
...if you die or are far from me...

01:37:10.554 --> 01:37:13.555
...though you may love me,
I will die too.

01:37:18.107 --> 01:37:20.343
In three months...

01:37:20.698 --> 01:37:22.225
...that's right, in April...

01:37:22.394 --> 01:37:24.249
...I'll be a hit at the Olympia.

01:37:24.411 --> 01:37:27.094
With a full house. We'll be flush.

01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:29.909
Edith, your liver cells
are not functioning normally.

01:37:30.075 --> 01:37:31.024
Paris, February 1960

01:37:31.195 --> 01:37:34.098
You've been ill.
You need rest. It's serious.

01:37:34.267 --> 01:37:36.755
I'm just 44. I'm not in the tomb yet.

01:37:36.923 --> 01:37:39.957
With the cancellations,
we have no more assets.

01:37:40.124 --> 01:37:42.164
You're saying it's my fault.

01:37:42.332 --> 01:37:45.780
That's not it, Edith.
It's the tax authority.

01:37:46.139 --> 01:37:49.303
We owe 120,000 francs
as a first installment.

01:37:49.468 --> 01:37:52.632
It's jaundice! I don't need
100 years to convalesce.

01:37:52.797 --> 01:37:54.586
That's pushing it.

01:37:55.677 --> 01:37:58.492
I want to perform at the Olympia!

01:38:04.285 --> 01:38:05.747
Anything else?

01:38:05.917 --> 01:38:08.667
Yes, we must stop giving in to her.

01:38:08.829 --> 01:38:11.163
I can't always keep an eye on her.

01:38:11.325 --> 01:38:13.235
She left the hospital too soon.

01:38:13.406 --> 01:38:17.301
The Olympia in three months...
It's a catastrophe waiting to happen.

01:38:17.469 --> 01:38:19.357
She needs these challenges.

01:38:19.518 --> 01:38:21.275
It's a losing proposition.

01:38:21.439 --> 01:38:25.017
Then I have to tell the insurance guys
it's all cancelled.

01:38:25.183 --> 01:38:27.386
We must decide for her, that's final.

01:38:27.551 --> 01:38:29.461
Whether she likes it or not.

01:38:58.496 --> 01:39:00.187
Edith...

01:39:21.058 --> 01:39:24.441
I said to myself, "Edith, it's all over!"

01:39:24.611 --> 01:39:26.269
He's got someone else. You lost him.

01:39:26.435 --> 01:39:27.864
He was having an affair?

01:39:28.035 --> 01:39:31.101
Would I be telling you this if he were?

01:39:31.298 --> 01:39:33.688
He left the restaurant. I was hiding.

01:39:33.859 --> 01:39:35.420
My Marcel crossed all of New York...

01:39:35.587 --> 01:39:39.864
...to eat with an old blind black boxer...

01:39:40.035 --> 01:39:43.777
...he had met a few years earlier.
Imagine that.

01:39:44.547 --> 01:39:46.620
Guys like that are hard to come by.

01:39:46.788 --> 01:39:48.577
"My Marcel"...

01:39:48.739 --> 01:39:51.806
"My Marcel"! That's all you talk about.

01:39:52.356 --> 01:39:53.883
Nothing else matters.

01:39:57.381 --> 01:39:59.649
But let me tell you, Ginou...

01:40:00.164 --> 01:40:01.757
...I'll never have him.

01:40:02.277 --> 01:40:06.138
He'll never be mine.
He won't leave his wife and kids.

01:40:11.429 --> 01:40:13.698
He calls her every single day.

01:40:15.238 --> 01:40:16.699
I pretend not to notice.

01:40:16.998 --> 01:40:19.136
I want him to be happy.

01:40:21.414 --> 01:40:22.362
I'll be back.

01:40:27.879 --> 01:40:30.017
I could've been Edith Piaf.

01:40:30.503 --> 01:40:32.837
There's more to life than songs.

01:40:43.783 --> 01:40:45.758
It's been too long, Marcel!

01:40:45.927 --> 01:40:47.967
Call Orly. Catch a plane tonight.

01:40:48.423 --> 01:40:50.790
The long journey by boat will kill me.

01:40:50.952 --> 01:40:53.221
I miss you, Marcel.

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.033
I can't be apart from you anymore.

01:40:57.032 --> 01:40:59.007
Maybe I should go back to Paris?

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:02.880
-Hold on.
-I'm just Madame's lapdog.

01:41:03.049 --> 01:41:04.390
Stop.

01:41:06.344 --> 01:41:09.159
Rum, Coke! Whiskey!

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.808
People think I'm a piece of shit.

01:41:12.137 --> 01:41:14.723
Boozing it up in Belleville was better.

01:41:17.641 --> 01:41:19.431
You dropped me, Edith.

01:41:19.945 --> 01:41:21.734
Enough, Momone!

01:41:23.753 --> 01:41:25.893
Get her out of my sight.

01:41:30.153 --> 01:41:32.096
I'll be taking the boat.

01:41:32.874 --> 01:41:35.012
Here's to your career, Edith!

01:41:40.139 --> 01:41:43.271
Please, Marcel. Leave tonight. For me!

01:42:33.038 --> 01:42:36.519
-You sleep late when I'm not here.
-Thank God, Marcel.

01:42:36.879 --> 01:42:38.537
Thank you.

01:42:47.823 --> 01:42:51.020
I'll make you some coffee. Don't move.

01:42:57.359 --> 01:42:59.399
Let me serve you.

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.928
What are you doing there?

01:43:35.058 --> 01:43:36.716
I knew you'd come!

01:43:39.345 --> 01:43:42.280
Lucien had a rough time
buying the tickets.

01:43:47.346 --> 01:43:48.753
I have a present for you.

01:43:52.050 --> 01:43:53.807
You're in bad shape.

01:43:53.971 --> 01:43:56.459
You need sun. You're so pale.

01:44:05.044 --> 01:44:06.670
Ginou!

01:44:07.891 --> 01:44:10.674
Ginou. I'm looking for the watch!

01:44:16.276 --> 01:44:19.375
What's gotten into you?
I'm looking for the watch!

01:44:19.541 --> 01:44:21.996
It was here,
in a long red Cartier package...

01:44:22.165 --> 01:44:24.304
...it was here, damn it!

01:44:32.694 --> 01:44:34.068
What is wrong with you all?

01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:38.256
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!
Where is that watch?

01:44:42.678 --> 01:44:45.231
I'm looking for Marcel's watch!

01:44:45.815 --> 01:44:47.275
What?

01:44:48.374 --> 01:44:49.781
Louis?

01:44:50.326 --> 01:44:52.017
What's going on?

01:44:54.071 --> 01:44:56.591
You must be brave, Edith.

01:44:58.039 --> 01:44:59.795
Is it Marcel?

01:45:01.079 --> 01:45:02.421
What?

01:45:05.112 --> 01:45:07.119
The plane crashed...

01:45:20.729 --> 01:45:22.354
Marcel!

01:47:02.719 --> 01:47:05.370
What more can I tell you, Miss Piaf?

01:47:06.335 --> 01:47:08.026
They say you're the best psychic...

01:47:08.191 --> 01:47:09.980
That may be...

01:47:10.143 --> 01:47:13.340
...it's your third time this week.
What more can I say?

01:47:13.503 --> 01:47:15.478
Why do you come back?

01:47:17.023 --> 01:47:19.511
So that you can tell me again...

01:47:20.768 --> 01:47:23.834
...so I can remember why
I must go on living.

01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:28.149
He died in the sky,
so he must be up there...

01:47:40.033 --> 01:47:42.455
California, August 1955

01:47:50.658 --> 01:47:53.920
Hey, Jacques Pills! Can you step on it?

01:47:54.082 --> 01:47:55.576
I need some air.

01:47:57.953 --> 01:47:58.902
That's lovely.

01:47:59.074 --> 01:48:02.009
Step on it. Our pin-up's melting!

01:48:02.979 --> 01:48:04.801
I'll get a sore throat.

01:48:04.963 --> 01:48:06.785
Then you'll take care of me...

01:48:06.946 --> 01:48:08.157
...Iike a good husband.

01:48:08.323 --> 01:48:10.330
The best hubby I've had.

01:48:10.498 --> 01:48:12.604
The first you've had!

01:48:13.539 --> 01:48:16.321
You plan on gawking at us all day?

01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:21.369
I'm sick to my stomach.

01:48:21.635 --> 01:48:24.483
Watch it, you'll ram us
into the scenery.

01:48:25.539 --> 01:48:28.638
Let me drive. Stop, I'll drive.

01:48:28.804 --> 01:48:31.073
That way Ginou can throw up.

01:48:35.908 --> 01:48:36.857
Go on, Ginou.

01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:40.514
May I help Madame...

01:48:42.053 --> 01:48:43.776
Go on, Ginou!

01:48:43.974 --> 01:48:46.395
Very good. Bravo!

01:48:52.134 --> 01:48:53.148
Bye, Ginou.

01:48:54.118 --> 01:48:56.060
Wait for me!

01:48:59.557 --> 01:49:01.314
You sure know how to drive.

01:49:04.134 --> 01:49:06.688
At least our outing wasn't for nothing...

01:49:06.854 --> 01:49:09.157
...we killed a tree!

01:49:16.903 --> 01:49:19.172
Unbelievable, what shitty service!

01:49:19.335 --> 01:49:22.019
Anybody here to take our order?

01:49:22.567 --> 01:49:25.666
Calm down, dear. You're no star here.

01:49:25.831 --> 01:49:27.238
Tonight you play the Mocambo.

01:49:27.399 --> 01:49:28.545
Really?

01:49:28.712 --> 01:49:31.265
Remind me who's invited us tomorrow?

01:49:31.432 --> 01:49:35.294
Marlon Brando,
Ginger Rogers, Mr. Chaplin...

01:49:39.145 --> 01:49:40.607
What is that?

01:49:42.281 --> 01:49:44.321
We never ordered that crap!

01:49:54.954 --> 01:49:56.197
Don't touch me!

01:49:56.362 --> 01:49:58.631
-Let me see.
-Don't touch me, I said!

01:49:58.794 --> 01:50:00.866
Wipe yourself off.

01:50:03.146 --> 01:50:05.448
We'd better get a divorce.

01:50:09.771 --> 01:50:13.186
How many injections per day, Madame?

01:50:14.123 --> 01:50:16.065
About ten...

01:50:17.227 --> 01:50:20.129
Sorry to be so direct...

01:50:20.299 --> 01:50:22.720
...but why are you doing this?

01:50:25.419 --> 01:50:27.940
So my body will shut up!

01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:35.271
When did you start
these daily injections?

01:50:35.436 --> 01:50:38.698
Five years ago,
after the plane crash. I...

01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:43.562
I was becoming arthritic.
I couldn't knit anymore.

01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:48.011
You are seriously dependant.

01:50:48.845 --> 01:50:50.405
An addiction...

01:50:50.573 --> 01:50:52.067
Doctor...

01:50:52.365 --> 01:50:54.787
...I'd like my wife to go to rehab.

01:50:57.613 --> 01:50:59.336
I want to get better.

01:50:59.501 --> 01:51:01.028
I can.

01:51:05.645 --> 01:51:09.956
October 1960- 5 years later

01:51:29.968 --> 01:51:32.455
Danielle, a chair.

01:51:41.391 --> 01:51:42.952
Edith...

01:51:49.648 --> 01:51:51.404
Here, Edith.

01:51:52.112 --> 01:51:53.868
Sit down.

01:52:03.761 --> 01:52:05.005
Bruno...

01:52:10.546 --> 01:52:12.912
There'll be no Olympia.

01:52:19.346 --> 01:52:20.906
I understand, Edith.

01:52:32.243 --> 01:52:33.901
No!

01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:44.177
I want you to meet
Charles Dumont, composer...

01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:46.610
...and Michel Vaucaire, lyricist.

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:50.130
They've come back to play their song.

01:52:57.686 --> 01:52:59.595
Be quick. I'm tired.

01:53:36.215 --> 01:53:37.492
Stop!

01:53:38.775 --> 01:53:40.531
I like it.

01:53:40.951 --> 01:53:42.707
Go on!

01:54:03.001 --> 01:54:04.757
You're marvelous!

01:54:04.921 --> 01:54:08.052
Exactly what I've been waiting for.
It's incredible.

01:54:08.217 --> 01:54:09.624
It's me!

01:54:09.785 --> 01:54:12.088
That's my life. It's me!

01:54:12.250 --> 01:54:14.802
Call Coquatrix. The Olympia is on!

01:54:14.970 --> 01:54:17.304
Play it again. It's so beautiful.

01:54:46.139 --> 01:54:49.009
"Take care my favorite sparrow.
Your friend Marguerite"

01:54:50.523 --> 01:54:53.819
Everyone's here: Aznavour,
Mr. Cocteau, Yves Montand.

01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:57.013
Montand's here?
I read he wasn't in France.

01:54:57.180 --> 01:54:58.358
He came for you!

01:54:58.524 --> 01:55:00.630
They've been waiting for 30 minutes.

01:55:00.797 --> 01:55:02.619
The place is heating up.

01:55:13.885 --> 01:55:15.990
They're not too tight?

01:55:18.269 --> 01:55:19.611
Who is that?

01:55:19.774 --> 01:55:21.301
A friend.

01:55:41.727 --> 01:55:43.963
Come on, Edith...

01:55:44.191 --> 01:55:45.717
...stand up.

01:55:50.943 --> 01:55:52.470
My cross?

01:55:54.111 --> 01:55:55.704
My cross...

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:00.280
We forgot it. I'll get it.

01:56:00.448 --> 01:56:01.855
I won't sing without it!

01:56:02.944 --> 01:56:06.043
Out! Everybody out!

01:57:13.445 --> 01:57:17.667
Grasse, October 1963
Her last night

01:57:18.021 --> 01:57:19.395
See you tomorrow.

01:57:19.557 --> 01:57:21.564
Go on. I'll handle it.

01:57:26.277 --> 01:57:28.285
I'm afraid, Simone...

01:57:28.453 --> 01:57:31.836
...I'm losing my memory.
It's very serious.

01:57:33.254 --> 01:57:35.774
My thoughts are muddled.

01:57:36.005 --> 01:57:39.202
I'm trying to remember...

01:57:39.366 --> 01:57:41.538
...but I can't.

01:57:42.630 --> 01:57:47.202
Other memories are surfacing,
not the ones I want to see.

01:57:49.735 --> 01:57:51.262
I wanted to see his watch.

01:57:51.431 --> 01:57:53.852
Do you remember? Marcel's watch?

01:57:54.024 --> 01:57:56.325
No, Edith. I didn't know him.

01:57:56.487 --> 01:57:59.106
I wanted to see his watch...

01:58:16.809 --> 01:58:18.848
That's some face!

01:58:20.297 --> 01:58:22.239
You've got wild eyes.

01:58:25.321 --> 01:58:27.461
The kid's not so bad.

01:59:00.459 --> 01:59:01.703
Simone.

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:03.591
Yes, Edith?

01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:07.944
I didn't pray.

01:59:10.955 --> 01:59:13.444
I want to pray on my knees.

01:59:14.156 --> 01:59:18.215
No one will reproach you
if you're not on your knees.

01:59:18.573 --> 01:59:21.573
I want to pray for my daddy.

02:00:21.904 --> 02:00:23.529
Marcelle...

02:00:26.993 --> 02:00:29.001
My daughter, my little ghost.

02:00:30.929 --> 02:00:32.904
Only Momone knows about it.

02:00:33.617 --> 02:00:35.504
I need to tell you about my child.

02:00:35.665 --> 02:00:36.811
Take it easy, Edith.

02:00:36.977 --> 02:00:38.733
Marcelle!

02:00:47.281 --> 02:00:50.599
Marcelle, go to bed.
I've had enough today.

02:00:50.770 --> 02:00:54.382
Think I can keep an eye out
for the cops and your kid?

02:00:54.546 --> 02:00:56.815
What the hell's Louis doing?

02:00:57.907 --> 02:00:59.401
It's him. Your father.

02:01:04.019 --> 02:01:05.263
Did she eat?

02:01:05.555 --> 02:01:08.141
They said you were
on the street with her!

02:01:08.307 --> 02:01:09.255
Who said?

02:01:09.427 --> 02:01:12.690
You get her twice a month
and you screw up!

02:01:12.852 --> 02:01:14.346
I said not the streets!

02:01:23.733 --> 02:01:25.456
Come quick!

02:01:27.317 --> 02:01:29.171
It's Marcelle! Come on!

02:01:32.788 --> 02:01:34.315
Marcelle's in the hospital!

02:01:56.118 --> 02:01:57.744
Are you her mother?

02:01:58.551 --> 02:02:01.486
Meningitis. Nothing could be done.

02:02:01.655 --> 02:02:03.313
I'm sorry.

02:02:36.409 --> 02:02:37.870
Edith...

02:02:39.353 --> 02:02:41.011
...I have the cross.

02:02:57.306 --> 02:02:58.867
Hello.

02:02:59.034 --> 02:03:01.555
They said you were on the beach.

02:03:02.394 --> 02:03:04.369
Thank you for granting this interview.

02:03:04.538 --> 02:03:06.449
My pleasure.

02:03:07.482 --> 02:03:09.970
It's odd to see you so far from Paris.

02:03:10.139 --> 02:03:12.528
I'm never far from Paris.

02:03:13.883 --> 02:03:18.520
I've a list of questions.
Answer whatever comes to mind.

02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:24.081
Well...

02:03:24.444 --> 02:03:26.353
...what is your favorite color?

02:03:26.652 --> 02:03:28.080
Blue.

02:03:28.252 --> 02:03:30.041
What's your favorite dish?

02:03:30.204 --> 02:03:32.179
Pot roast.

02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:36.595
Would you agree to live a sensible life?

02:03:36.765 --> 02:03:38.869
It's already the case.

02:03:42.717 --> 02:03:44.855
Who are your most faithful friends?

02:03:45.021 --> 02:03:47.739
My true friends are faithful.

02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:52.182
If you could no longer sing...

02:03:54.110 --> 02:03:56.150
I could no longer live.

02:03:57.309 --> 02:03:59.284
Are you afraid of death?

02:04:00.542 --> 02:04:02.680
Less than solitude.

02:04:04.542 --> 02:04:05.687
Do you pray?

02:04:05.854 --> 02:04:09.400
Yes, because I believe in love.

02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:12.180
I don't want to go, Simone.

02:04:13.215 --> 02:04:14.709
Where is ThÃ©o?

02:04:15.198 --> 02:04:17.020
I want my husband.

02:04:17.183 --> 02:04:19.671
ThÃ©o will be here in less than an hour.

02:04:20.703 --> 02:04:23.453
What is your fondest career memory?

02:04:24.319 --> 02:04:26.840
Every time the curtain goes up.

02:04:41.536 --> 02:04:44.090
Your fondest memory as a woman?

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:47.033
The first kiss.

02:04:48.801 --> 02:04:50.230
Do you like nighttime?

02:04:50.402 --> 02:04:53.402
Yes, with a lot of light.

02:04:53.570 --> 02:04:54.999
Dawn?

02:04:55.361 --> 02:04:57.946
With a piano and friends.

02:04:58.114 --> 02:04:59.641
The evening?

02:04:59.810 --> 02:05:02.329
Because for us it's dawn.

02:05:07.810 --> 02:05:10.144
See, you're breathing.

02:05:17.379 --> 02:05:19.583
I can't go back.

02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:24.641
I can't.

02:06:02.277 --> 02:06:06.620
If you were to give advice to a woman,
what would it be?

02:06:07.237 --> 02:06:08.764
Love.

02:06:09.062 --> 02:06:10.491
To a young girl?

02:06:10.662 --> 02:06:11.774
Love.

02:06:11.942 --> 02:06:13.633
To a child?

02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:15.805
Love.

02:06:18.439 --> 02:06:20.544
Who are you knitting for?

02:06:22.118 --> 02:06:24.573
Whoever will wear my sweater.

02:06:26.471 --> 02:06:30.464
That's all. I hope it wasn't too long.

02:06:32.359 --> 02:06:33.603
Thank you very much.

02:06:33.767 --> 02:06:36.037
Thank you, young lady.
