00:00.001 --> 00:03.041
- What if luck was something you could own?

00:03.379 --> 00:04.979
You should try the corners.

00:05.026 --> 00:06.026
Wheel's spinning.

00:11.618 --> 00:15.498
What if someone gave you something
that made you really lucky?

00:15.665 --> 00:16.501
What is this?

00:16.565 --> 00:19.500
Whoever wears the bracelet
is endowed with immense lock.

00:19.502 --> 00:21.338
I have a gambling addiction.

00:21.436 --> 00:22.356
I'm worried, Harry.

00:22.358 --> 00:24.842
I don't want to lose
anything else after the house.

00:24.854 --> 00:27.429
It's a balance, Harry. It's Yin and Yang.

00:27.489 --> 00:29.089
Mr. and Mrs. Clayton.

00:29.585 --> 00:30.785
Daisy.

00:33.425 --> 00:37.170
When I killed your
mother, I was young. Naive.

00:37.260 --> 00:39.228
I was meant to give it to someone else,

00:39.331 --> 00:41.251
and he knows you have it, Harry.

00:42.985 --> 00:45.829
I've been targeted by Golding
because I got too close to him.

00:45.831 --> 00:49.670
Everything close to you
gets destroyed. You're toxic.

00:51.545 --> 00:53.665
I don't want you in my life any more.

00:57.331 --> 00:58.851
I don't feel very lucky now!

01:00.002 --> 01:03.682
You may have to make a deal with
the devil if you want Clayton.

01:03.905 --> 01:06.002
Why do you think Orwell
sat on Rich's release?

01:06.020 --> 01:07.495
Don't say anything to Orwell.

01:07.587 --> 01:08.627
No, Harry, get down!

01:11.290 --> 01:12.290
Do it!

01:17.625 --> 01:19.945
That's the thing about luck, Harry.

01:20.065 --> 01:22.225
It always balances out in the end.

01:51.427 --> 01:53.444
- How long since the call?
- Eight minutes.

01:58.481 --> 01:59.561
We're not going to make it.

02:03.105 --> 02:05.505
Sir, we are here to help.
Just tell us what happened.

02:15.345 --> 02:16.468
Harry!

02:17.769 --> 02:20.756
One day your luck is gonna run out.

02:21.804 --> 02:23.324
I'm not lucky.

02:23.326 --> 02:25.787
<i>Paramedics are now on the scene.</i>

02:29.996 --> 02:31.868
Sir?

02:37.412 --> 02:39.465
Police. Police!

02:40.893 --> 02:43.556
Mr. Thomas, I'm DI Clayton
and this is DS Chohan.

02:43.558 --> 02:44.537
What's going on?

02:44.539 --> 02:46.385
Mr. Thomas, can you
tell us where you've been

02:46.387 --> 02:47.833
and what you've done in the last 24 hours?

02:47.835 --> 02:49.259
I don't understand!

02:49.307 --> 02:51.365
- We believe you may have been poisoned.
- What?!

02:51.403 --> 02:53.260
Mr. Thomas, anything out
of the ordinary happened?

02:53.262 --> 02:54.267
Poisoned?!

02:54.447 --> 02:55.637
Who would want to poison me?

02:55.639 --> 02:57.229
Can you remember meeting
anyone you didn't know?

02:57.231 --> 02:59.884
- The tiniest thing... an argument?
- No, nothing.

02:59.886 --> 03:02.474
God, my stomach...

03:02.476 --> 03:03.836
David, stay with me.

03:03.943 --> 03:05.209
Sir?

03:05.333 --> 03:07.987
- God...
- Please, help me.

03:08.348 --> 03:10.839
OK, sir, just try and stay still.

03:10.841 --> 03:12.081
- David? - I need some adrenaline.
- Help me!

03:12.083 --> 03:13.796
Quick! We're losing him.

03:13.920 --> 03:14.920
Sir?

03:15.152 --> 03:16.152
Sir?

03:57.060 --> 03:58.742
I wanted to show you this.

04:00.327 --> 04:03.058
Golding tried to leave the
country... border controls kicked in.

04:03.130 --> 04:06.062
They should have taken him, but there
was a backup car and he got away.

04:06.064 --> 04:09.624
Eve, we'll find him. We're getting closer.

04:09.763 --> 04:10.763
Gotta go.

04:11.492 --> 04:13.897
We'll find him quicker if
you let the bracelet help us.

04:15.134 --> 04:16.623
I know the risks.

04:17.630 --> 04:19.168
I know what I'm asking.

04:19.310 --> 04:22.331
- I can't.
- Harry, this is Golding.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.390
This is the man that killed my
mother... that nearly killed Daisy.

04:24.414 --> 04:26.813
Yeah, and we'll catch him.
This photo proves that.

04:26.891 --> 04:31.235
But say I do? Say I let
luck help us. What-what-what then?

04:31.317 --> 04:34.078
No. We lock him up and Anna finds
out she's got some terrible disease,

04:34.132 --> 04:37.537
or-or-or whatever else this
thing does to balance luck out.

04:37.591 --> 04:39.407
I don't want anything to do with it.

04:40.129 --> 04:41.860
No more gambling.

04:42.293 --> 04:44.795
No silly risks.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.639
Nothing.

04:47.508 --> 04:50.668
Eve, we'll find him. Gotta go.

04:59.260 --> 05:00.260
Suri.

05:00.303 --> 05:03.026
- I've got those other locations for you.
- Tox report?

05:03.028 --> 05:04.709
Yes, same as the previous three.

05:04.711 --> 05:08.477
Our killer is using a syringe
to inject ricin into his victims.

05:08.479 --> 05:10.280
Unless they treated within two hours...

05:10.316 --> 05:12.427
Which is unlikely, as they
don't even know it's happened.

05:12.451 --> 05:13.811
Then, by the time the call 999,

05:13.835 --> 05:16.714
they're on the verge of multiple
organ failure. 24 hours later...

05:16.783 --> 05:18.103
They're dead.

05:18.611 --> 05:21.460
I've mapped the victims'
work and home locations.

05:23.495 --> 05:24.495
There.

05:25.060 --> 05:27.773
No, it's still too spread out.

05:27.775 --> 05:30.381
I don't suppose you've got all
their old work and home addresses?

05:30.440 --> 05:32.290
- I mean all of them.
- Yeah.

05:32.343 --> 05:33.505
Take a look at that.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.806
So, at some time over the past ten years,

05:35.878 --> 05:40.151
every victim either worked
or lived around here.

05:40.746 --> 05:43.500
- Brick Lane.
- That's where we should start.

05:47.480 --> 05:51.120
Could be from Brick Lane, could
be from the area, but anyone... No?

05:51.210 --> 05:54.079
No. All right, thanks. Thank you very much.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.021
Anything?

05:55.114 --> 05:57.034
I don't know what I'm
supposed to be looking for.

05:58.215 --> 06:00.103
Maybe they passed through
Allen Gardens, down there.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.527
Maybe that's the link.

06:01.747 --> 06:03.318
Spitalfields...

06:03.530 --> 06:05.010
Maybe through the brewery.

06:06.553 --> 06:09.311
If I wanted to hide
somewhere, this is the place.

06:09.515 --> 06:13.875
I'll get someone to trawl through
CCTV. See if that leads anywhere.

06:13.877 --> 06:15.810
We need something more concrete.

06:15.961 --> 06:18.520
Quick pint and a curry on me... and
there's a gig later, if you fancy.

06:18.522 --> 06:21.882
- No, I've got to get going.
- Right... 8:40 at Chepstow.

06:22.023 --> 06:24.403
- I don't do that any more.
- I'm just messing.

06:24.486 --> 06:27.589
- How many days since you last made a bet?
- 186.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.667
Right now, I'm off to see Anna and Daisy.

06:29.730 --> 06:31.650
- Well, I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

06:31.809 --> 06:32.797
What's the gig?

06:32.831 --> 06:36.056
There's a talk about brain
and behavioural science.

06:38.632 --> 06:39.813
What? It'll be fun!

06:39.865 --> 06:42.330
Yeah, and I'm... I'm
gutted I turned it down now.

06:42.458 --> 06:46.300
I'm a lot of fun. I'm the best
fun you could have, full stop.

06:46.302 --> 06:48.118
- You ask any guy.
- No, of course you are.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.259
No, wait... not like that!

06:50.317 --> 06:53.117
Yeah. Let's stop this while we can
still look at each other in the eye?

06:53.190 --> 06:55.276
- See you tomorrow.
- OK, take it easy.

07:03.667 --> 07:04.846
Excuse me...

07:05.812 --> 07:06.812
Hey...

07:07.576 --> 07:08.576
Oi!

07:10.722 --> 07:13.399
Oi! Come here! Wait!

07:16.342 --> 07:17.342
Oi!

07:20.306 --> 07:21.306
Oi!

07:22.310 --> 07:23.894
Oi!

07:24.050 --> 07:25.050
Hey!

07:35.269 --> 07:36.652
Great.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.531
Harry, what a pleasant surprise.

08:13.610 --> 08:15.385
Well, this is a professional visit, Finley.

08:15.457 --> 08:17.343
Have you got a young Asian
kid in your employment?

08:17.367 --> 08:19.920
I just chased him in here, and he
got very nervous at the sight of me.

08:19.944 --> 08:23.623
You mean Rui Hirota. He
started with us yesterday.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.955
Can I talk to him? Where is he?

08:26.011 --> 08:27.528
His English is rubbish.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.295
He's only been in the country a day.

08:29.350 --> 08:30.933
Are you sure he's only been here a day?

08:31.006 --> 08:34.263
I arranged his pick-up from
the airport. What's this about?

08:34.886 --> 08:38.969
It's a case I'm working on around
here, but it's a few weeks old.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.580
Then he's not your guy.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.591
But, look, it's not all
bad. You're here again.

08:43.654 --> 08:44.951
It's professional.

08:45.344 --> 08:48.725
Nice to see you, Harry. I'll make
sure the kid stays out of trouble.

08:48.790 --> 08:49.956
Yeah, you do that.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.127
I don't bet.

08:54.676 --> 08:55.895
Sure you don't.

09:08.556 --> 09:09.634
No more bets.

09:11.671 --> 09:12.730
14.

09:13.044 --> 09:14.716
That's your number, sir.

09:17.186 --> 09:18.186
Sir?

09:23.411 --> 09:25.947
Again? I can't believe it!

09:38.942 --> 09:40.363
Sir, your winnings. Sir.

09:40.365 --> 09:41.365
Sir.

09:42.136 --> 09:44.976
Sometimes it feels like I can never lose.

09:48.845 --> 09:50.489
Madam bets on 13.

09:50.947 --> 09:52.946
You know that feeling, don't you, Harry?

09:53.060 --> 09:54.380
Place your bets, please.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.337
Sir bets on 7.

10:03.563 --> 10:04.950
No more bets.

10:18.716 --> 10:20.749
13! Madame wins again.

10:20.825 --> 10:22.403
This is just getting silly.

10:22.528 --> 10:24.491
Could you have someone
cash in my chips, please?

10:24.534 --> 10:26.228
Thank you ever so much.

10:26.971 --> 10:27.971
Wait.

10:30.070 --> 10:31.701
Where did you get that?

10:31.766 --> 10:32.846
I don't lose.

10:32.902 --> 10:35.971
How did it feel? A proper bet, at last.

10:36.041 --> 10:38.843
I can barely remember the
thrill, it's been so long.

10:38.906 --> 10:39.730
Who are you?

10:39.802 --> 10:41.082
How rude of me.

10:41.165 --> 10:44.636
Isabella Augustine. And
you are Harry Clayton.

10:46.262 --> 10:48.102
I thought you'd stopped all this.

10:48.222 --> 10:51.000
What on earth could
have dragged you back in?

10:51.063 --> 10:52.613
I'm on a case.

10:53.738 --> 10:55.498
How did you get the bracelet?

10:55.532 --> 10:56.728
Same as you, I imagine...

10:56.861 --> 10:59.760
though you don't seem to be
having half as much fun as I have.

11:00.566 --> 11:01.665
Wait a minute.

11:01.678 --> 11:03.558
I'm afraid you can't go in there.

11:03.655 --> 11:06.577
I do hope we meet again,
Harry. I'm new to London.

11:06.632 --> 11:09.352
It would be charming to
have someone show me around.

11:09.489 --> 11:11.999
In the meantime, good luck with your case.

11:12.415 --> 11:14.558
All the luck in the world.

11:28.928 --> 11:30.638
Eve, I need to talk to you.

11:30.712 --> 11:32.672
- I need to talk to you right now.
- Harry!

11:35.057 --> 11:36.137
Hiya.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.024
Bugger.

11:41.049 --> 11:42.324
- Oi!
- Language.

11:42.431 --> 11:44.179
Great, I think it's time we went home.

11:44.776 --> 11:48.243
OK. Well, erm, I'll come with.
Make sure you get there safely.

11:48.305 --> 11:49.838
We're OK.

11:49.958 --> 11:51.504
No, I can pop in when we get there.

11:51.506 --> 11:55.025
You know, check she's doing her
homework... and make you a cuppa.

11:55.184 --> 11:56.624
Or something.

11:59.055 --> 12:01.366
Yes... it's the "something"
we're trying to avoid, isn't?

12:01.414 --> 12:03.214
I'm not trying to avoid anything.

12:12.951 --> 12:13.951
Harry...

12:19.286 --> 12:21.446
I hope you realise how well I'm behaving.

12:21.478 --> 12:22.598
It's noted.

12:23.622 --> 12:25.582
It's not a walk in the park, you know?

12:27.081 --> 12:28.368
You're a good boy...

12:30.788 --> 12:32.090
and I love you.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.158
I love you, too.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.598
I always have.

12:42.769 --> 12:47.158
OK... I'm gonna go home and
have a very long, cold shower.

12:47.316 --> 12:50.004
That the most disgusting thing
I've ever heard in my entire life.

12:50.046 --> 12:52.051
It's definitely time we went home.

13:23.732 --> 13:25.332
Suri, what have you got?

13:25.491 --> 13:27.829
Helen Mitford, 28 years old.

13:27.871 --> 13:29.325
- Same killer?
- Yes.

13:29.419 --> 13:30.528
You sure?

13:31.238 --> 13:33.265
- Poisoned like the others.
- Yep.

13:33.267 --> 13:35.494
Jesus, this is speeding up.

13:36.003 --> 13:38.003
- Where does she live?
- Dalston.

13:38.159 --> 13:39.963
- Work?
- Kensington.

13:40.010 --> 13:41.661
So, neither of them near Brick Lane.

13:41.663 --> 13:43.990
I'm sorry. I was sure you'd found the link.

13:43.992 --> 13:45.108
Harry.

13:45.662 --> 13:46.968
Do you need some help?

13:48.843 --> 13:49.884
Suri, check again, will you?

13:49.908 --> 13:51.622
Perhaps she stayed at a
friend's house last night.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.456
The body was found in her own flat.

13:53.817 --> 13:55.234
Yeah. Of course.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.240
What have you got so far?

14:02.991 --> 14:03.991
George.

14:04.553 --> 14:07.163
There is an internal investigation, Harry,

14:07.165 --> 14:08.531
and I'm still here.

14:09.670 --> 14:11.990
Maybe it's time you started
accepting what everybody else...

14:11.992 --> 14:15.572
No. No. They just haven't
found sufficient proof, yet.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.369
I did nothing wrong.

14:21.390 --> 14:23.353
Have you found out how
he sources the poison?

14:25.881 --> 14:28.271
The basic components are
too easily manufactured...

14:28.273 --> 14:29.232
he can get them anywhere.

14:29.288 --> 14:31.505
What about age, race?

14:31.614 --> 14:33.317
- Any common denominators?
- I checked!

14:34.696 --> 14:37.150
I've gone over it a hundred
times, OK? There's nothing.

14:38.562 --> 14:39.562
OK.

14:41.209 --> 14:44.349
I guess even the best cop
runs out of luck sometimes?

14:45.017 --> 14:47.912
- Credit card details came through.
- Please be good news.

14:47.983 --> 14:49.957
Guess where Helen had a curry last night.

14:56.552 --> 14:58.161
It doesn't matter that
they don't remember her...

14:58.163 --> 15:00.730
we know she was here, we
just follow the old leads.

15:00.915 --> 15:02.628
Well, it's got to be somewhere.

15:02.690 --> 15:04.372
But we don't know what we're looking for.

15:04.788 --> 15:06.068
Yeah, I know.

15:06.258 --> 15:07.858
Let's go back to the station.

15:09.918 --> 15:11.478
I blame you for this, by the way.

15:11.598 --> 15:12.913
Why? What did I do?

15:12.960 --> 15:14.747
Well... I can't concentrate properly,

15:14.814 --> 15:17.824
now I know you're such
incredibly great fun...

15:17.887 --> 15:19.154
with the guys.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.424
- You're a dick.
- I'm your senior officer.

15:21.494 --> 15:23.414
- You're a dick, sir.
- Now, that's more like it.

15:25.035 --> 15:26.035
Look out!

15:32.438 --> 15:33.478
Are you OK?!

15:34.869 --> 15:35.980
Yeah, I'm...

15:36.023 --> 15:39.117
- I'm fine.
- I can't believe it missed you!

15:39.773 --> 15:40.845
Suri...

15:45.516 --> 15:47.254
It looks like some sort of lab.

15:47.561 --> 15:48.561
Hello?

15:51.903 --> 15:54.342
My God. This is him. It has to be.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.539
- Is that ricin?
- Why else does he have a gas mask?

15:58.563 --> 15:59.863
Don't touch anything!

16:00.138 --> 16:01.539
Unbelievable!

16:01.822 --> 16:04.457
Un-bloody-believable.
How lucky is this?!

16:05.774 --> 16:07.794
It isn't it. It can't be.

16:07.796 --> 16:09.832
What? All this falling into our laps?

16:09.834 --> 16:11.038
I didn't...

16:11.088 --> 16:12.877
It can't be. I didn't. I didn't.

16:12.951 --> 16:14.205
Harry?

16:17.927 --> 16:19.286
Hey, stop!

16:20.831 --> 16:21.831
Police, stop!

16:33.227 --> 16:37.295
We need backup now! Brick
Lane Passage. Male, IC4.

16:37.320 --> 16:38.723
Come on, open the gate?

16:38.809 --> 16:42.414
It's over. We've seen your
face. We know who you are.

16:43.316 --> 16:44.526
And who's that, then?

16:45.307 --> 16:46.568
I'm no-one.

16:46.854 --> 16:49.266
Just some fool you laugh at and ignore.

16:52.275 --> 16:55.190
- Come on, come on.
- This is so crazy, right?

16:55.260 --> 16:56.423
And I could touch you!

16:57.998 --> 17:01.418
We will have your name in
half an hour, I promise you.

17:03.866 --> 17:05.022
Bummer.

17:06.531 --> 17:08.667
Just one lucky guess from
getting me, aren't you?

17:11.724 --> 17:13.069
Why don't you have a go?

17:19.994 --> 17:20.994
Yeah.

17:21.246 --> 17:23.243
Not catching me today, are you?

17:23.798 --> 17:25.397
So, how long have I got?

17:25.540 --> 17:27.356
A week? A few days?

17:27.401 --> 17:31.039
- It over, son. It's finished.
- No! Not yet.

17:31.101 --> 17:32.422
What are you planning?

17:32.477 --> 17:34.045
You'll see.

17:34.115 --> 17:36.238
- Big-time.
- Listen to me.

17:36.343 --> 17:39.543
No matter how many people you
kill, you will always lose.

17:39.718 --> 17:40.794
Not now.

17:41.422 --> 17:42.579
From now on...

17:43.958 --> 17:45.389
I'm going to enjoy it.

17:46.427 --> 17:47.609
No, son.

17:47.720 --> 17:50.358
Shit. Shit! Shit!

17:50.583 --> 17:53.167
- Come on!
- Where are you?!

17:54.331 --> 17:55.931
Suspect heading west.

18:01.668 --> 18:06.325
His name is Ajit Malhotra. 25 years
old, born and bred in Brick Lane.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.563
Father's dead, but we're
still looking for the mother.

18:08.734 --> 18:10.106
What about the victim, Helen?

18:10.227 --> 18:13.067
According to her friends, they
met in a bar a few years ago.

18:13.158 --> 18:15.259
She thought he was
sweet but a bit clingy...

18:15.370 --> 18:17.325
To be honest, no-one really knows.

18:17.446 --> 18:18.210
What else?

18:18.257 --> 18:20.218
We're building up a
really good picture of him.

18:20.358 --> 18:22.724
Clever boy, good at school,
according to his teachers.

18:22.818 --> 18:26.450
He had a place in the London
University of Sciences to read pharmacy,

18:26.543 --> 18:29.181
but, unfortunately, his parents
couldn't afford to send him

18:29.247 --> 18:31.790
when the family business went bankrupt.

18:31.855 --> 18:36.255
Things deteriorated significantly
when his father committed suicide.

18:36.478 --> 18:39.198
Three months later, Ajit had a breakdown.

18:39.373 --> 18:41.649
- When was this?
- Five years ago.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.761
He's been on medication ever since,

18:43.858 --> 18:46.458
but he hasn't seen a psychiatrist
for over six months now.

18:46.494 --> 18:48.840
We're bringing her in
for further information.

18:49.872 --> 18:52.563
Everyone's waiting for you
to tell them what to do.

18:52.731 --> 18:53.887
<i>Can you not?</i>

18:54.160 --> 18:56.511
You're acting DSI, Harry.
You're running this case.

18:56.513 --> 18:58.193
You have to go in there.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.106
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

19:00.174 --> 19:01.283
there's no way you could have caught him.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.050
It doesn't matter what anyone says.

19:03.399 --> 19:05.721
We were lucky to find
him in the first place.

19:14.782 --> 19:17.132
- All right, everyone.
- Hey, Harry.

19:17.202 --> 19:19.664
Hard luck. I hear you were this close.

19:20.996 --> 19:22.196
So...

19:22.403 --> 19:27.367
We now have a clear link
between Ajit and the last victim,

19:27.453 --> 19:30.721
and a possible motive. Suri
will give you the details.

19:31.762 --> 19:35.377
What we need now are similar links
between Ajit and the other four.

19:35.398 --> 19:37.690
Well, you have that,
in that he killed them.

19:41.811 --> 19:44.870
If we can work out how he knew
them, why he wanted them dead,

19:44.872 --> 19:46.260
then we can figure out who's next.

19:46.308 --> 19:48.465
That is the key to all of this.

19:51.554 --> 19:53.484
Look, it's straightforward enough.

19:53.581 --> 19:56.181
Get your allocated actions,
report back to Suri. I'm...

19:56.278 --> 19:57.838
going somewhere I can think.

20:12.136 --> 20:13.283
Harry.

20:14.932 --> 20:16.448
How funny.

20:16.788 --> 20:18.777
I was just thinking about you.

20:18.870 --> 20:20.524
What a coincidence.

20:20.598 --> 20:22.175
Coincidence my arse.

20:22.315 --> 20:25.291
Well, I have no idea what
that means, but anyway...

20:25.293 --> 20:28.093
Hello! Fancy a bite to eat?

20:28.301 --> 20:31.932
There's the most gorgeous place
nearby. Best view in London.

20:32.003 --> 20:34.452
I'm in the middle of the case.
I don't have time for you.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.518
So, you're still not using the bracelet.

20:45.524 --> 20:48.168
I nearly died yesterday. No.

20:48.238 --> 20:51.658
Instead, I had the luckiest
break in a case I've ever had.

20:52.569 --> 20:57.247
You said you wish me all the luck
in the world, and then that happened.

20:58.363 --> 20:59.830
Was that you?

21:00.635 --> 21:03.757
Well, it sounds rather outlandish
when you put it like that...

21:03.908 --> 21:06.271
but, then again...

21:07.122 --> 21:08.478
You're trouble.

21:09.595 --> 21:11.101
I've heard you like trouble.

21:11.134 --> 21:12.195
Not any more.

21:12.265 --> 21:13.921
I suppose you must be scared.

21:14.753 --> 21:17.078
Well, you've not had the
bracelet long, have you?

21:17.168 --> 21:21.303
Are you sure I can't tempt
you to dinner? It's on me.

21:22.794 --> 21:23.834
Nah.

21:25.953 --> 21:27.753
And unlike you, Harry...

21:28.626 --> 21:30.952
I'm not scared of anything.

21:32.092 --> 21:33.621
Why do think that is?

21:48.033 --> 21:49.154
What? What?

21:50.793 --> 21:53.744
Five minutes? Is that all I get?

21:53.815 --> 21:55.930
Could you not cope without me
for more than five bloody minutes?

21:55.954 --> 21:57.938
Do I have to wipe your arses, as well?

22:02.613 --> 22:04.330
I'd rather you didn't.

22:04.392 --> 22:05.932
Jesus Christ.

22:06.433 --> 22:07.676
Not quite.

22:13.472 --> 22:15.493
Orwell brought me up to speed.

22:16.479 --> 22:18.239
Well, I should do that.

22:18.327 --> 22:19.525
You weren't here.

22:20.134 --> 22:26.226
So, tell me what exactly
did Ajit say to you?

22:27.322 --> 22:28.801
He knows I'll catch him.

22:29.504 --> 22:32.304
But he's planning on
something big before you do.

22:33.179 --> 22:37.768
So, we're hours or days
away from a major atrocity,

22:37.885 --> 22:41.048
and you don't have a single concrete
lead as to where to find this boy.

22:41.099 --> 22:44.104
- We almost had him.
- Almost isn't good enough.

22:44.939 --> 22:46.784
Sorry, sir... a call for Suri.

22:50.027 --> 22:51.339
Steve...

22:51.653 --> 22:53.053
give us a minute, will you?

23:01.572 --> 23:03.223
- You look...
- Like death?

23:03.286 --> 23:04.286
Well...

23:04.813 --> 23:05.813
Thanks.

23:06.281 --> 23:08.586
Yeah, my doctor's furious.

23:10.077 --> 23:11.497
But this case is a mess.

23:11.499 --> 23:13.310
I'm not a DSI.

23:13.419 --> 23:15.104
I didn't ask to be put in temporary charge.

23:15.106 --> 23:17.193
I work better on my own... you know that.

23:22.962 --> 23:26.176
I came to visit you in the
hospital a couple of times.

23:26.274 --> 23:27.714
You were unconscious...

23:29.305 --> 23:33.669
and, erm, I didn't know
if you wanted to see me.

23:34.794 --> 23:35.794
Why?

23:36.577 --> 23:39.058
Because I ended up with a bullet inside me?

23:40.053 --> 23:42.925
Again. Because of you.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.218
Do you remember that?

23:49.076 --> 23:51.579
I'm sorry, sir, it's
just we found his mother.

23:57.925 --> 24:01.431
Once we lost the shop and people
stopped talking to us, he...

24:01.757 --> 24:03.946
disappeared into himself.

24:04.445 --> 24:07.181
It was like the shame stank.

24:08.304 --> 24:11.515
- You wouldn't understand.
- I understand.

24:12.436 --> 24:13.629
Too well.

24:13.704 --> 24:15.166
You have a son?

24:15.772 --> 24:17.052
I have a daughter.

24:18.619 --> 24:20.424
Ajit was heartbroken.

24:20.426 --> 24:23.866
- When did you last see him?
- Not for a year now.

24:23.997 --> 24:25.599
Was there anyone in particular,

24:25.601 --> 24:28.321
anyone you think he
wanted to take revenge on?

24:28.476 --> 24:31.438
Why a year? It's a long time.

24:31.546 --> 24:33.312
He only lives round the corner.

24:33.852 --> 24:35.113
What happened?

24:36.630 --> 24:39.822
I just told him to stop
idolising his father.

24:40.371 --> 24:42.732
That he wasn't half the
man he claimed to be.

24:42.793 --> 24:43.852
And?

24:44.378 --> 24:45.818
And...

24:46.126 --> 24:49.291
I was glad his father was gone.

24:50.142 --> 24:52.708
I couldn't live with that shame any more.

24:53.210 --> 24:55.267
I didn't even mean it.

24:55.375 --> 24:57.489
We all say things, don't we?

24:57.973 --> 24:59.269
It's you.

24:59.337 --> 25:00.912
You're his next target.

25:05.664 --> 25:07.654
So, you talked to the mother?

25:07.740 --> 25:09.174
She's downstairs in the interview room.

25:09.176 --> 25:12.112
We have found a link between
Ajit and every victim. May I?

25:12.144 --> 25:14.785
This is David Thomas. He was
a bank manager six years ago.

25:14.850 --> 25:17.982
He rejected a loan that would have
funded Ajit's university tuition.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.204
This is our first victim. Sanjiv Ganetra.

25:20.206 --> 25:21.584
He worked with Ajit three years ago

25:21.608 --> 25:23.128
in one of the restaurants in Brick Lane.

25:23.152 --> 25:25.198
He sacked him for his bad attitude.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.253
He had a grudge against each and every one,

25:27.255 --> 25:30.038
and he hasn't been to see
his mother in over a year.

25:30.105 --> 25:31.937
So, what? You think the
mother might be next?

25:31.939 --> 25:33.299
I don't know, I...

25:33.704 --> 25:35.112
I-I'm not sure.

25:35.580 --> 25:37.070
Do you want to join in here, Steve?

25:37.708 --> 25:38.988
He's fine.

25:39.544 --> 25:40.746
So, what do you want to do?

25:40.793 --> 25:42.902
I want to tail Mrs. Malhotra home.

25:42.972 --> 25:45.568
Let Ajit think she's alone, and
then, when he comes to get her...

25:45.590 --> 25:48.455
You want to use her as bait.
Well, that's... that's some risk.

25:48.515 --> 25:50.571
I want to catch him before
he hurts anyone else.

25:50.621 --> 25:52.600
I'll be with her at all times.

25:53.044 --> 25:54.710
Why is he not arguing with me?

25:54.813 --> 25:57.823
All right. Set up covert surveillance.

25:57.826 --> 26:02.097
You can have, err,
Suri, Steve and five officers.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.640
I can run this case on my own.

26:03.681 --> 26:05.721
Steve won't be running anything.

26:06.064 --> 26:10.031
The internal investigation into
his conduct during the Golding case

26:10.087 --> 26:11.874
found that he didn't follow protocol

26:11.911 --> 26:15.749
and, as a result, he's been reduced
to the rank of detective constable

26:15.819 --> 26:18.412
- with immediate effect.
- Is that it?

26:18.483 --> 26:21.024
I don't wanna hear another word about it!

26:21.225 --> 26:23.424
Whatever anyone thinks,

26:23.910 --> 26:26.230
he works to you, Suri, OK?

26:27.312 --> 26:28.656
Yes, sir.

26:29.816 --> 26:31.381
Right, let's get this organised, then.

26:31.444 --> 26:32.444
Yes.

26:33.582 --> 26:35.783
- Here's to you.
- Fantastic! Can you?

26:36.972 --> 26:38.132
Sir...

26:38.175 --> 26:40.640
I've put Mrs. Malhotra
in interview room three.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.553
Moaning about the colour of the walls.

26:42.555 --> 26:44.715
Thanks, Ade. It's a bit early.

26:45.647 --> 26:49.028
You should see the custody
suite... Sarge is doing a conga.

26:49.076 --> 26:52.818
The Fell brothers... we won
the case, guilty on all counts.

26:52.933 --> 26:53.511
What?

26:53.590 --> 26:55.675
It all kicked off in court. The defence...

26:59.379 --> 27:02.205
- Sorry, sir.
- What you talking about?

27:02.304 --> 27:03.504
It was Anna, sir.

27:08.897 --> 27:10.017
Anna?

27:10.465 --> 27:11.705
What happened?

27:13.226 --> 27:15.523
I heard you stopped mid-sentence,
like you'd seen a ghost,

27:15.579 --> 27:16.873
and then you just ran out.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.017
Who told you?

27:18.061 --> 27:19.517
The boys at the station.

27:20.238 --> 27:23.101
You can congratulate them on
their vivid powers of description.

27:23.155 --> 27:24.155
Anna!

27:26.582 --> 27:27.756
I thought I saw Golding.

27:27.792 --> 27:29.592
Golding's not gonna come after us.

27:29.927 --> 27:32.472
He's gonna be as far away from
you and me as he possibly can.

27:32.536 --> 27:35.053
He's got the entire British
police force searching for him.

27:36.462 --> 27:38.024
Why didn't you call me?

27:38.716 --> 27:40.184
Cos you don't wanna hear it.

27:40.186 --> 27:41.266
You don't.

27:41.340 --> 27:44.843
You want everything wiped clean.
So, we're trying, OK? So...

27:45.627 --> 27:48.038
So, Daisy keeps waking in the
middle of the night, screaming...

27:48.040 --> 27:48.753
- you know...
- What?!

27:48.800 --> 27:50.933
And my hands start
shaking for no reason...

27:51.008 --> 27:52.991
- but we're fine, we'll be fine.
- Jesus!

27:53.909 --> 27:55.829
I am so sorry. I...

27:56.293 --> 27:58.379
You've gotta tell me this stuff!

27:59.718 --> 28:03.974
I promise you, nothing bad will
happen to you and Daisy again.

28:06.417 --> 28:07.417
OK.

28:09.182 --> 28:11.262
- I've got to go home.
- Anna!

28:11.330 --> 28:13.683
- So, take off the bracelet.
- I can't.

28:13.739 --> 28:15.262
Because you think it brings you luck.

28:15.336 --> 28:17.878
Because you and your addiction is
now so completely out of control,

28:17.880 --> 28:19.255
you actually believe in this nonsense.

28:19.257 --> 28:21.076
I keep trying to explain
to you... let me show you.

28:21.078 --> 28:23.798
And I keep trying to tell
you, it is all in your mind!

28:29.039 --> 28:32.109
- I keep hoping there's a chance for us.
- Me, too!

28:33.986 --> 28:35.226
God.

28:35.968 --> 28:37.888
- You have a case to deal with.
- I... I hung up.

28:39.156 --> 28:40.916
I hung up. Anna!

28:41.873 --> 28:43.473
We miss you, Harry.

28:58.580 --> 28:59.651
Anything?

28:59.698 --> 29:01.589
Negative, negative... no visual.

29:01.591 --> 29:03.283
E1, are you in position?

29:03.392 --> 29:05.273
Roger, E1 in position.

29:05.347 --> 29:07.741
E5 in position.

29:23.055 --> 29:24.830
Please, will you step away from the window?

29:24.949 --> 29:27.285
I don't want Ajit to think that
anything is out of the ordinary.

29:27.309 --> 29:29.645
He won't come. He's a good boy.

29:29.738 --> 29:31.058
Just, please.

29:33.361 --> 29:34.618
All quiet.

29:36.747 --> 29:37.931
Hey, Suri...

29:38.710 --> 29:41.055
That's "Sarge" to you, Steve.

29:42.777 --> 29:46.304
Yeah, Sarge. All right. Listen...

29:46.947 --> 29:50.184
I'll take whatever punishment
the DSI wants to dish out.

29:50.407 --> 29:51.968
I'm not gonnna complain about it -

29:52.009 --> 29:55.186
and I know you're Harry's girl,
but you really think it's fair,

29:55.340 --> 29:58.300
that he gets nothing after
all the stunts pulled?

30:00.422 --> 30:04.237
I know what I saw. And
I'm not Harry's girl.

30:09.824 --> 30:12.599
Did you ever talk to any
psychiatrists about his breakdown?

30:12.649 --> 30:15.205
Those doctors and all their words.

30:15.594 --> 30:16.916
Might have been good for you.

30:17.524 --> 30:20.927
You could have understood why it
happened and how you could help him.

30:22.052 --> 30:24.071
I know why it happened.

30:24.653 --> 30:27.133
I was there when they
dragged his father away.

30:28.824 --> 30:30.173
I know my boy.

30:31.381 --> 30:33.158
I know how it hurt him.

30:35.299 --> 30:38.939
Staring at his father as
he howled and screamed.

30:40.244 --> 30:41.724
My little boy.

30:44.499 --> 30:46.543
Sobbing and sobbing.

30:47.403 --> 30:49.483
I couldn't even get to him.

30:50.571 --> 30:54.366
I wanted to pull him into my arms,
but the police wouldn't let me.

30:54.413 --> 30:56.490
- They dragged him away.
- What?

30:56.550 --> 30:57.830
Are you aware of this?

31:00.828 --> 31:02.646
He was 18, so he wasn't a kid.

31:02.648 --> 31:04.931
I thought it was the bailiffs
that kicked his father out.

31:04.990 --> 31:06.373
They tried...

31:07.226 --> 31:09.772
but he'd barricaded himself
in, so they called the cops.

31:09.839 --> 31:10.960
Sorry...

31:11.683 --> 31:16.561
You're telling me that it was the
police that took your husband out?

31:16.629 --> 31:18.855
Yes, I told you that.

31:18.922 --> 31:19.922
No.

31:21.302 --> 31:23.450
No, you didn't. Suri? Stay there.

31:23.935 --> 31:24.935
Harry?

31:27.286 --> 31:28.335
Orwell, did you see that?

31:28.386 --> 31:30.146
Suri, it's us... we're the target.

31:32.064 --> 31:34.494
- Steve! Steve!
- Whoa!

31:34.874 --> 31:36.630
Whoa, whoa! Steve?

31:51.687 --> 31:52.687
Harry?

31:54.087 --> 31:56.525
Seven officers in
intensive care. No deaths.

31:56.527 --> 31:58.354
The cards we're soaked in scopolamine...

31:58.356 --> 31:59.979
known as devil's breath.

32:00.037 --> 32:03.008
Ajit mixed it with buprenorphine
for increased potency.

32:03.062 --> 32:05.035
You just have to touch it to get infected.

32:05.113 --> 32:07.068
Yeah, they said that if they
treated them ten minutes later,

32:07.070 --> 32:08.275
they'd be dead.

32:08.462 --> 32:11.086
Harry, the chemicals in these
cards weren't in his flat.

32:11.118 --> 32:12.867
I don't think he makes them there.

32:13.402 --> 32:15.180
So, they're somewhere else.

32:16.128 --> 32:17.729
I need to see Steve.

32:23.444 --> 32:24.844
Jesus, Steve.

32:25.347 --> 32:26.587
You catch him?

32:26.779 --> 32:29.760
No. But I will. I promise.

32:29.816 --> 32:31.976
Same old story, innit?

32:32.082 --> 32:35.601
Harry comes up with a plan,
gambles on everyone's lives,

32:35.642 --> 32:39.888
Harry walks away fine, a colleague
ends up in intensive care.

32:39.965 --> 32:40.985
I didn't gamble.

32:41.027 --> 32:44.026
You were pretty quick to risk
Mrs. Malhotra, though, weren't you?

32:44.072 --> 32:45.465
You're not that sorry.

32:53.757 --> 32:55.503
We're seven down, Harry.

32:56.251 --> 32:57.830
No time for sulking.

32:59.853 --> 33:02.602
I keep going over everything Ajit said.

33:02.653 --> 33:05.140
Trying to find something
that might be missing...

33:05.211 --> 33:06.571
but there's nothing.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.467
I don't believe you.

33:10.465 --> 33:13.960
I let my prejudice about
you cloud my judgment.

33:15.867 --> 33:19.467
You went to jail and you were
nearly killed, and that was my fault.

33:21.133 --> 33:24.573
I pray for God's forgiveness
but I must ask it of you, too.

33:26.227 --> 33:27.427
I'm sorry.

33:32.387 --> 33:34.931
Anyway, right now we
have to solve this case.

33:35.027 --> 33:37.431
- Alistair, I don't know how to.
- You have to.

33:37.485 --> 33:39.682
You're a brilliant cop, Harry.

33:40.264 --> 33:43.582
You just make it hard for us
to remember that sometimes.

33:43.898 --> 33:45.267
Me, especially.

33:48.525 --> 33:50.045
Find him, Harry.

34:04.813 --> 34:06.843
Whoa!

34:06.907 --> 34:08.067
Shit.

34:08.139 --> 34:10.179
Sorry about that... Sorry.

34:10.545 --> 34:12.005
OK? I'm sorry.

34:12.043 --> 34:13.418
Here, let me...

34:16.346 --> 34:18.628
_ - Fancy a bite to eat?

34:18.770 --> 34:22.074
There's the most gorgeous place
nearby... best view in London.

34:38.766 --> 34:39.929
Here we are, sir.

34:45.020 --> 34:48.271
You've made it all the way here,
Harry, you might as well sit down.

34:53.980 --> 34:55.166
Salute.

34:57.787 --> 35:01.322
Has anything that's
happened... me meeting you here,

35:01.374 --> 35:05.765
the Japanese kid at the casino,
even nearly catching Ajit...

35:05.843 --> 35:09.584
has any of that happened
without you controlling it?

35:10.794 --> 35:11.994
How could I?

35:13.578 --> 35:15.547
Do you know where he is?

35:15.635 --> 35:17.059
Your poisoner?

35:17.828 --> 35:19.747
Why don't you find him yourself?

35:19.867 --> 35:21.147
Use the bracelet.

35:21.211 --> 35:22.491
I can't.

35:27.243 --> 35:31.552
When you were giving your bracelet,
you got a warning, I imagine.

35:31.844 --> 35:34.999
Some hokey nonsense that
luck balances itself out,

35:35.001 --> 35:37.880
and Yin and Yang, and
other silly superstitions.

35:37.993 --> 35:40.409
- Something like that, yeah.
- It's drivel.

35:40.475 --> 35:42.904
- I've seen how it works.
- No.

35:43.908 --> 35:47.408
You believe in bad luck because
you suffered it all your life.

35:47.413 --> 35:48.613
Really?

35:49.705 --> 35:51.772
You learned it from an early age.

35:55.906 --> 35:57.410
Who are you?

35:58.118 --> 35:59.549
I'm someone...

36:01.649 --> 36:03.974
I seize luck and make it mine.

36:06.970 --> 36:09.750
The problem is not on your
arm. It's in your head.

36:11.140 --> 36:12.578
I can help you.

36:13.768 --> 36:14.873
Why?

36:20.067 --> 36:22.803
Because it's lonely
having a secret like this.

36:23.967 --> 36:28.717
And you are the only other person
in the world who can understand.

36:29.841 --> 36:32.558
I've worn this for over ten years.

36:33.989 --> 36:36.458
I can teach you the good stuff.

36:36.547 --> 36:38.507
Find that buzz you've been missing.

36:41.427 --> 36:43.278
If you're playing me...

36:44.410 --> 36:46.776
Funniest thing happened this morning.

36:46.835 --> 36:51.250
I was thinking about you...
again! I can't help it...

36:51.301 --> 36:55.250
and as I was walking, I saw
this gigantic flock of birds,

36:55.371 --> 36:57.363
I mean, huge, flying right over me.

36:57.403 --> 36:59.030
It nearly knocked me to the floor,

36:59.078 --> 37:02.337
before disappearing into
this old, disused warehouse.

37:03.012 --> 37:07.194
And what's weird is that
no-one else seemed to see them.

37:08.988 --> 37:12.118
You know what they say about flocks
of birds like that, don't you?

37:13.388 --> 37:15.152
No, what do they say?

37:17.177 --> 37:19.733
Well, they're a portent of doom.

37:24.001 --> 37:25.561
It's probably nothing...

37:26.150 --> 37:28.230
but it did make me wonder...

37:28.741 --> 37:33.157
If I were on the run, plotting
murder, where would I hide?

37:35.236 --> 37:36.783
The address is in there.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.618
Let luck do the rest.

37:43.019 --> 37:45.007
If my family get hurt...

37:45.067 --> 37:47.590
- They won't.
- They might.

37:47.787 --> 37:49.667
Aye, there's the rub.

38:30.617 --> 38:32.235
Harry, wait!

38:32.471 --> 38:33.471
Harry?

38:34.505 --> 38:35.992
- Harry!
- Did you know?

38:36.061 --> 38:37.061
What?

38:37.113 --> 38:38.173
That there was another bracelet.

38:38.197 --> 38:39.305
- Did you know that?
- No.

38:39.307 --> 38:42.474
- How about the mysterious Isabella?
- No... why, what's she told you?

38:42.537 --> 38:43.810
That you're a liar.

38:43.865 --> 38:45.984
- OK, listen...
- Luck doesn't even itself out,

38:45.986 --> 38:47.168
you made that up.

38:47.170 --> 38:48.830
- Why would I?
- I don't know.

38:48.832 --> 38:51.377
To stop me using it
properly, to control me.

38:51.379 --> 38:55.507
I have been begging you to use it,
to help me finally catch Golding.

38:55.570 --> 38:56.379
Yeah.

38:56.439 --> 38:57.960
When you want to use it,
it's perfect, but for me,

38:57.962 --> 39:00.950
there's uncertainty, there's
danger, there's Yin and Yang.

39:01.707 --> 39:02.660
Screw you.

39:02.662 --> 39:04.609
There's a man out there
who wants to kill hundreds,

39:04.633 --> 39:06.339
maybe thousands of people,

39:06.353 --> 39:08.557
and there's no way of
beating him except for this.

39:08.603 --> 39:09.403
Exactly.

39:09.474 --> 39:12.613
So, what kind of luck would it
take to stop a man like that,

39:12.696 --> 39:14.826
and what would be the price?

39:16.208 --> 39:17.727
It's a gamble?

40:31.577 --> 40:32.577
Suri?

40:33.275 --> 40:35.417
- I found it.
- What?

40:36.251 --> 40:38.730
- His lab.
- What?! How?

40:38.778 --> 40:40.336
No sign of him, though.

40:40.845 --> 40:44.445
Jesus, you wanna see this place...
there's masses of stuff. There's...

40:45.067 --> 40:51.107
bottles of sodium chloride, ethanol...

40:51.188 --> 40:54.747
dimethyl methylphosphonate, is that it?

40:54.827 --> 40:57.535
Phosphorus trichloride...

40:58.390 --> 40:59.722
It's live.

41:00.591 --> 41:05.747
It's live... there's beakers
and test tubes, containers and...

41:06.445 --> 41:08.795
Harry, those are the components
you need to make sarin.

41:08.797 --> 41:10.477
God, he'll kill thousands.

41:10.541 --> 41:12.119
- Jesus.
- Look, where are you?

41:12.183 --> 41:14.746
Maybe he'll come back there...
if we get surveillance in place...

41:35.521 --> 41:38.745
Suri, what was the name of the
university he wanted to go to?

41:38.856 --> 41:40.431
London what?

41:40.525 --> 41:43.271
God. London University of Science.

41:43.363 --> 41:45.948
You've got to get here.
Everyone has to get here.

41:46.046 --> 41:49.075
If he's using sarin, he'll
need to use an air vent.

41:49.111 --> 41:51.753
You have to get to the
roof, Harry. Get to the roof.

41:51.789 --> 41:52.909
I'm coming.

42:09.795 --> 42:11.157
Ajit, stop.

42:11.378 --> 42:12.378
No.

42:12.480 --> 42:13.756
I'm doing this, you're not stopping me.

42:13.780 --> 42:15.265
Your father wouldn't want this.

42:15.267 --> 42:16.787
Have you got atropine on you?

42:17.370 --> 42:19.365
How about pralidoxime? That'll work.

42:19.972 --> 42:22.532
They're just students,
Ajit. They've done nothing.

42:22.605 --> 42:24.650
It is not their fault you lost your place.

42:24.755 --> 42:26.350
They've got futures.

42:26.405 --> 42:28.245
Well, at least they did, until today.

42:28.369 --> 42:30.916
You can't stop me. You know you can't.

42:31.022 --> 42:32.742
- Ajit!
- If I were you,

42:32.987 --> 42:35.171
I'd get as far from here as you can.

42:42.448 --> 42:44.136
What if my family get hurt?

42:44.250 --> 42:45.262
They won't.

42:45.642 --> 42:47.570
Let luck do the rest.

42:48.547 --> 42:49.959
I'm back.

43:08.513 --> 43:09.039
Agh!

43:09.056 --> 43:12.802
Ajit Malhotra, I am arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

43:18.049 --> 43:19.096
Anna.

43:24.471 --> 43:25.307
Harry.

43:25.329 --> 43:27.147
Jesus, what's happened?

43:27.225 --> 43:28.928
I was in the middle of making dinner

43:28.998 --> 43:30.945
and a bloody fox got in upstairs.

43:31.009 --> 43:32.422
I don't know how...
it's dragged a pigeon in,

43:32.446 --> 43:34.853
there's blood everywhere,
it's absolutely disgusting.

43:34.876 --> 43:36.057
God!

43:36.153 --> 43:37.670
Are you all right?

43:39.741 --> 43:40.845
Yeah.

44:24.250 --> 44:26.050
I want to know what else it can do.

44:31.304 --> 44:32.987
I want to know everything.

44:37.991 --> 44:39.475
Harry...

44:40.649 --> 44:42.849
we're going to have such fun.

44:49.032 --> 44:50.958
- _
- So, what's so special about this chap?

44:51.008 --> 44:53.794
He's the fiance of one of
the officers from our station.

44:53.819 --> 44:56.068
He is involved. I can feel it.

44:56.070 --> 44:57.722
We are all sinners, Harry,

44:57.724 --> 44:59.973
but some of us are
willing to face our demons.

44:59.975 --> 45:02.930
How are you filling the
God-shaped hole in your soul?

45:02.932 --> 45:06.675
We are gonna have one mother
of a complaint made against us.

45:06.762 --> 45:08.522
The world is full of bad people.

45:08.587 --> 45:10.944
Are you going to spend your
whole life chasing them all?

45:10.976 --> 45:14.897
Ours is a life of continual good fortune.

45:14.930 --> 45:18.251
- Stay away from Harry Clayton.
- All you've done is lie, Eve.

45:18.253 --> 45:19.952
These are our streets!

45:20.006 --> 45:21.944
And we're taking them back!
