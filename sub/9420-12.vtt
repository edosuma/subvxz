12:25.145 --> 12:26.478
Koree dropped off the face

12:26.480 --> 12:27.779
Of the earth.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.314
>> she made some impression.

Wow, so you changed her

13:56.903 --> 13:58.236
Password, and took over the

14:55.628 --> 15:01.099

15:03.236 --> 15:05.637
So we wanted to know what your

Plan is.

How did you meet this group?

15:21.454 --> 15:22.620
>> we, like, grew up together,

15:22.622 --> 15:23.354
Basically.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.289
>> how close were you when all

15:24.291 --> 15:25.256
This was going down?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.658
>> close.
>> i mean, yeah, we were

15:26.660 --> 15:27.576
>> i mean, yeah, we were

15:27.577 --> 15:28.493
>> 'cause it actually started,

15:28.495 --> 15:29.127
Like, at the end of

15:29.129 --> 15:29.727
Middle school.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.395
>> eighth grade.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.062
>> mm-hmm.

15:31.064 --> 15:31.996
>> yeah, high school definitely

15:31.998 --> 15:32.964
Wasn't easy for me.

15:32.966 --> 15:33.898
I mean, i know it's not easy

15:33.900 --> 15:34.565
For a lot of people.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.533
Everybody goes through things

15:35.535 --> 15:36.868
In high school, but the fake

15:36.870 --> 15:38.603
Profile of me made it a lot

15:38.605 --> 15:39.437
Harder.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.872
My reputation went from, like,

15:40.874 --> 15:42.240
"wow, she's a really friendly,

15:42.242 --> 15:43.608
Outgoing person,"

15:43.610 --> 15:44.842
To like, "wow, she's nothing

15:44.844 --> 15:45.510
But drama."

15:45.512 --> 15:47.011
>> was there like a moment where

15:47.013 --> 15:48.780
You guys need to stand up for

15:48.782 --> 15:50.114
Falesha because people didn't

15:50.116 --> 15:51.449
Believe her?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.417
>> yes.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.518
When i saw her walk down the

15:53.520 --> 15:55.787
Hallway, the way people were

15:55.789 --> 15:57.488
Looking at her, it killed me,

15:57.490 --> 16:00.992
'cause i love her, you know?

16:00.994 --> 16:02.860
Just seeing a strong person

16:02.862 --> 16:06.564
Like that getting broke down,

16:06.566 --> 16:08.833
It just killed me.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.401
I saw her go into the bathroom,

16:10.403 --> 16:12.704
So chased after her, and she was

16:12.706 --> 16:13.771
Sitting on the floor, just like

16:13.773 --> 16:15.440
Bawling her eyes out.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.808
And i was like, "no, it's gonna

16:16.810 --> 16:17.475
Be okay.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.577
Don't worry about this stuff.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.845
Like, i'm gonna be next to you

16:20.847 --> 16:21.846
The whole rest of the way,

16:21.848 --> 16:23.247
The whole rest of the year."

16:23.249 --> 16:24.549
And after that, i seriously was

16:24.551 --> 16:25.984
With her like every single

16:25.986 --> 16:26.751
Moment in the hallway.

16:26.753 --> 16:27.819
And nobody was going to say

16:27.821 --> 16:29.787
Anything to her.

16:29.789 --> 16:30.855
We're almost 20 years old,

16:30.857 --> 16:31.622
And this has been happening

16:31.624 --> 16:33.524
Since we were in eighth grade.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.260
Like, it's time for it to stop.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.662
>> we're going to try and walk

16:37.664 --> 16:39.564
You through the process we went

16:39.566 --> 16:40.598
Through yesterday, see if we can

16:40.600 --> 16:42.100
Can make sense of all this.

16:42.102 --> 16:43.334
So the first thing we did

16:43.336 --> 16:45.636
Was we went to your messages

16:45.638 --> 16:46.571
That you sent us.

16:46.573 --> 16:47.572
One of them was this girl

16:47.574 --> 16:48.539
Danielle,

16:48.541 --> 16:50.375
And we facetimed with her.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.510
>> she said that there was a guy

16:52.512 --> 16:54.312
In her school that started

16:54.314 --> 16:55.646
Dating jacqueline...

16:55.648 --> 16:56.314
>> online.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.815
>> and that is was weird,

16:57.817 --> 17:00.485
Because the girl whose picture

17:00.487 --> 17:01.953
It was was kind of way out of

17:01.955 --> 17:02.620
His league.

17:02.622 --> 17:03.287
>> was the girl--

17:03.289 --> 17:03.955
>> it was you.

17:03.957 --> 17:04.655
>> okay, okay.

17:04.656 --> 17:05.390
>> it was falesha, right.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.656
>> and then the guy left school

17:06.659 --> 17:08.059
Because he was getting harassed

17:08.060 --> 17:09.359
By jacqueline.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.061
One of our big concerns here

17:11.064 --> 17:12.463
Was that you weren't the only

17:12.464 --> 17:13.830
Sort of target of this.

17:13.833 --> 17:14.965
So that sort of raised the

17:14.968 --> 17:15.933
Stakes a little bit more.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.835
>> yeah, that's not okay.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.337
>> so the next person we looked

17:19.339 --> 17:20.805
At was this girl jennifer,

17:20.807 --> 17:22.773
And jennifer really helped crack

17:22.776 --> 17:23.574
The case.

17:23.576 --> 17:24.809
She sort of back-doored

17:24.810 --> 17:26.444
Jacqueline and created a fake

17:26.445 --> 17:27.845
Account as a guy that was

17:27.847 --> 17:29.580
Into her, to find out her

17:29.582 --> 17:30.715
Login information.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.483
>> oh, my god! [laughs]

17:32.485 --> 17:33.151
This is crazy.

17:33.153 --> 17:33.818
>> this is wild.

17:33.820 --> 17:34.852
>> so jennifer hacked in,

17:34.854 --> 17:36.387
And she figured out who made

17:36.389 --> 17:37.455
The jacqueline page.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.690
Tracey [bleep].

17:39.692 --> 17:40.792
You don't know this girl, right?

17:40.794 --> 17:41.959
>> never seen her before

17:41.961 --> 17:42.827
In my life.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.395
>> she's 20 years old.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.096
>> oh, my god, [bleep],

17:45.098 --> 17:45.730
Maryland.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.731
>> that's where the phone number

17:46.733 --> 17:48.332
Where she called you had come

17:48.334 --> 17:49.033
From.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.168
There's not a lot on here.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.003
She's got one post: "deleting.

17:52.005 --> 17:52.837
Text me."

17:52.839 --> 17:55.740
And she listed a number.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.707
She's got three profile

17:56.709 --> 17:58.109
Pictures.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.777
>> there's miley cyrus.

17:59.779 --> 18:00.645
That's hannah montana.

18:00.647 --> 18:01.412
>> wow.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.980
>> which the jacqueline linkwood

18:02.982 --> 18:04.482
Profile always used to--

18:04.484 --> 18:05.983
Would post stuff about them.

18:05.985 --> 18:06.884
>> that's interesting.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.886
So, the posters on her wall

18:08.888 --> 18:09.954
Are similar to the sort of

18:09.956 --> 18:11.489
People she mentioned being a

18:11.491 --> 18:12.457
Fan of.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.491
>> yes.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.026
I'm like speechless right now.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.527
I feel like that's overwhelming.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.495
There's so much to take in.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.162
>> yeah.

18:18.164 --> 18:19.130
>> i think at this point,

18:19.132 --> 18:20.531
We need to make contact.

18:20.533 --> 18:21.766
>> it's worth the risk.

18:21.768 --> 18:22.834
I want to see who it is.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.339
>> i think we need
to make contact.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.090
To make contact.

18:29.091 --> 18:29.840
I'm going to try and call,

18:29.843 --> 18:31.275
See if we can get her to agree

18:31.277 --> 18:32.110
To meet up with us,

18:32.112 --> 18:33.511
And take it from there.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.712
>> i want answers.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.913
>> you guys wait here.

18:35.915 --> 18:40.051

18:46.359 --> 18:48.126
Hi, this is nev.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.461
You may have heard of a show

18:50.463 --> 18:52.964
Called <i> catfish</i> on mtv.

18:52.966 --> 18:53.998
>> [laughs]

18:54.000 --> 18:57.335
>> who am i speaking with?

18:57.337 --> 18:58.569
>> oh, cool.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.471
So, i got your number off of

19:00.473 --> 19:02.440
A weird facebook post, saying

19:02.442 --> 19:03.508
That you were like deleting the

19:03.510 --> 19:05.042
Account and this is the number

19:05.044 --> 19:06.944
People should reach you on?

19:06.946 --> 19:07.645
>> uh huh.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.715
>> i was trying to see what your

19:10.717 --> 19:12.550
Connection is to

19:12.552 --> 19:20.291

19:20.293 --> 19:23.661
>> [laughs]

19:23.663 --> 19:26.063
>> so you seem okay

19:26.065 --> 19:26.731
Talking about it.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.798
Is this--it's not something

19:27.800 --> 19:29.300
That you're like hiding?

19:35.707 --> 19:37.308
But you were very quick to

19:37.310 --> 19:44.115
Expose yourself just now.

19:44.117 --> 19:46.450
I was hoping we could meet up.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.553
Your jacqueline linkwood profile

19:48.555 --> 19:50.121
Has been around for a while,

27:10.596 --> 27:13.664
Cyberbullied killed themselves?

>> really? [laughs]

27:14.467 --> 27:15.899
>> yeah, really.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.501
>> i wouldn't cry!

27:17.503 --> 27:18.736
Like, would you want me to cry?

27:18.738 --> 27:20.037
It's not my fault they killed

27:20.039 --> 27:20.704
Themselves.

27:20.706 --> 27:21.872
They made that choice

27:21.874 --> 27:23.240
Themselves, so it's their fault,

27:23.242 --> 27:23.907
Not mine.

27:23.909 --> 27:25.709
>> maybe people really did that

27:25.711 --> 27:27.044
Because you told them to.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.312
That could've been the trigger.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.179
That doesn't bother you?

27:29.181 --> 27:30.547
>> it--it does not bother me.

27:30.549 --> 27:31.315
It's not my fault.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.516
I did not hold a gun to their

27:32.518 --> 27:33.350
Heads, saying, "go kill

27:33.352 --> 27:34.018
Yourself."

27:34.020 --> 27:35.019
>> yeah, but with some people

27:35.021 --> 27:36.020
That have really low

27:36.022 --> 27:36.787
Self-esteem--

27:36.789 --> 27:37.454
>> well, i have high

27:37.456 --> 27:38.956
Self-esteem.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.758
>> look, this--this is...

27:40.760 --> 27:42.526
Relatively pointless,

27:42.528 --> 27:43.727
What's going on right here.

27:43.729 --> 27:45.262
>> am i done with her?

28:19.431 --> 28:21.231

28:22.268 --> 28:23.367
The saddest thing i've ever

28:23.369 --> 28:24.968
Experienced in my life.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.078
Capability of feeling guilt.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.347
>> there has to be a more real

29:10.349 --> 29:11.782
Version of her that we're not

29:11.784 --> 29:12.549
Yet seeing.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.650
We need to get through to

This far gone.

29:33.706 --> 29:36.140
All of her real emotions,

29:36.142 --> 29:37.775
And completely buried them.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.610
We just have to help her

Feel something.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.179
>> i don't think we're gonna

29:42.181 --> 29:45.516
Get through to her.

29:45.518 --> 29:46.950
We're--we can try.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.152
I think we might get through

29:48.154 --> 29:49.353
To her mom?

29:54.393 --> 29:55.726
A little bit about

29:55.728 --> 29:57.961
What we think we can do.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.730
>> if we can try to get her mom

29:59.732 --> 30:02.266
To help get through to her,

30:02.268 --> 30:03.901
That would maybe make all of

30:03.903 --> 30:05.135
This worthwhile.

>> i think it's a good idea.

Cut out for us.

30:09.074 --> 30:14.111
A difference.

>> it'll be interesting to see

30:15.047 --> 30:16.814

Of bewildered as to what to do

I didn't want her to come.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.348
Wanted to be just me.

Taking her pictures.

>> hmm.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.063
>> eventually it turned

31:40.065 --> 31:42.466
Very evil and she started

31:42.468 --> 31:43.800
Telling telling people to kill

31:43.802 --> 31:45.102
Theirself, and telling them that

31:45.104 --> 31:46.203
They were fat and that they

Were ugly.

If i were to press harassment

Is eventually going to happen to

36:19.178 --> 36:20.544
You.

Sometimes, like, "oh, my gosh,

What if i get arrested?"

Sort of huge personality that

36:44.570 --> 36:46.136
You presented to us yesterday.

36:46.138 --> 36:47.370
Well, you need to start really

36:47.372 --> 36:51.508
Showing people that.

36:51.510 --> 36:52.676
Here's an opportunity to

36:52.678 --> 36:57.547
Actually show us the real you.

37:07.492 --> 37:08.725
They'll leave.

37:08.727 --> 37:09.993
>> i don't want to say that it's

37:09.995 --> 37:11.294
Okay, because what you did

37:11.296 --> 37:14.331
Really isn't okay.

Was sorry.

Jacqueline profile around the

37:24.109 --> 37:25.108
Same time that your dad got

37:25.110 --> 37:26.509
Sick, so maybe that kind of

37:26.511 --> 37:27.811
Triggered an emotion that you

37:27.813 --> 37:30.714
Couldn't cope with.

37:30.716 --> 37:31.848
I feel like you kind of numbed

37:31.850 --> 37:32.916
Yourself out.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.352
You don't wanna feel anything.

37:35.354 --> 37:36.953
But just to block everybody out

37:36.955 --> 37:38.455
Is not always the answer, and i

37:38.457 --> 37:39.623
Feel like actually letting

37:39.625 --> 37:41.024
Yourself feel something will

37:41.026 --> 37:42.993

37:42.995 --> 37:47.864
Yourself be truly happy one day.

Just right now, you realize that

Way you've been dealing with
