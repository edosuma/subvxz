01:52.088 --> 01:54.547
<i>The beginning is the end.</i>

01:56.047 --> 01:58.047
<i>And the end is the beginning.</i>

02:00.380 --> 02:02.713
<i>Everything is interconnected.</i>

02:05.547 --> 02:06.880
<i>Future,</i>

02:07.505 --> 02:08.838
<i>past</i>

02:09.713 --> 02:11.213
<i>and present.</i>

02:13.755 --> 02:16.338
<i>I couldn't tell her who her mother is.</i>

02:20.005 --> 02:22.880
<i>Just as I can't tell you...</i>

02:23.880 --> 02:25.880
<i>what your provision is.</i>

02:28.547 --> 02:30.755
<i>And what I have to do today.</i>

02:32.630 --> 02:35.380
I've reflected on this moment
for many years.

02:36.463 --> 02:38.672
My older me

02:38.755 --> 02:40.422
wanted to tell me something,

02:40.963 --> 02:42.547
but he couldn't.

02:49.463 --> 02:52.422
If you knew what I now know,

02:54.088 --> 02:58.422
then you would no longer do what you must
so I can get to this moment.

02:59.630 --> 03:03.463
Me, as I stand here now, cannot exist

03:03.547 --> 03:06.172
if you don't take the same path as I did.

03:10.838 --> 03:12.422
We're not free

03:13.922 --> 03:15.547
in what we do,

03:17.005 --> 03:19.505
because we're not free in what we desire.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.588
Everything is ready.

03:32.422 --> 03:34.005
You must go now.

04:09.422 --> 04:12.005
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

05:33.713 --> 05:36.130
JUNE 27, 2020

05:36.213 --> 05:40.088
THE DAY OF THE APOCALYPSE

05:50.422 --> 05:52.463
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
PASSPORT

06:06.213 --> 06:08.422
<i>My future me tried to shut the hole.</i>

06:10.338 --> 06:11.922
<i>To reverse it all.</i>

06:14.713 --> 06:17.838
He shut the passage,
but hadn't broken the loop.

06:18.797 --> 06:22.713
But you said we can change
a small part of the equation, so he...

06:26.630 --> 06:28.422
So I will be successful next time.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.588
Then none of this sick shit
will ever happen.

06:33.213 --> 06:34.838
Mikkel won't disappear.

06:36.338 --> 06:37.880
Michael won't die.

06:41.922 --> 06:43.297
Your father won't die.

06:55.672 --> 06:58.338
Big and small things
don't abide by the same laws.

06:59.922 --> 07:02.005
Maybe nothing big can be altered...

07:08.088 --> 07:09.338
but small things can.

07:13.630 --> 07:15.463
We're changing a grain of sand.

07:18.297 --> 07:20.338
And with it, the whole world.

07:28.630 --> 07:30.297
What was Grandma like?

07:30.838 --> 07:32.505
I mean, as a mother.

07:33.338 --> 07:35.505
Why does it suddenly interest you?

07:39.338 --> 07:41.172
She isn't dead, you know?

07:42.172 --> 07:43.797
What do you mean?

07:44.505 --> 07:45.838
She was here.

07:46.588 --> 07:48.005
Last fall.

07:49.588 --> 07:51.505
After Mikkel disappeared.

07:53.963 --> 07:55.213
She...

07:56.380 --> 07:58.880
She left something here.

08:01.588 --> 08:02.755
For you.

08:17.797 --> 08:20.047
She said she was sorry.

08:22.338 --> 08:24.922
And that if she could turn back time,

08:27.130 --> 08:29.463
she'd do lots of things differently.

08:47.797 --> 08:49.213
I'll be back.

08:51.172 --> 08:52.505
I promise.

08:56.463 --> 08:58.130
Where are you going?

09:20.130 --> 09:21.755
Do you know what this is?

09:27.005 --> 09:29.213
A search warrant for the power plant.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.130
Special conditions apply to the plant.

09:33.213 --> 09:35.547
The judge issued the warrant immediately.

09:36.922 --> 09:38.172
I think,

09:38.838 --> 09:42.380
given the ongoing legal proceedings
against you,

09:43.713 --> 09:45.922
he may be interested in
what's to be found there.

09:51.005 --> 09:53.338
WARRANT

09:55.755 --> 09:58.630
Maybe I can't prove you killed my brother,

10:01.797 --> 10:03.963
but I'll get you for what's going on here.

10:12.422 --> 10:14.463
You have to let me out of here.

10:14.547 --> 10:15.838
That's impossible.

10:16.797 --> 10:18.213
I can't do that.

10:20.088 --> 10:22.130
You can't let him onto the site!

10:24.338 --> 10:25.797
Maybe this is better.

10:26.588 --> 10:28.922
Maybe it's good
it's all finally coming out.

10:49.963 --> 10:53.255
Martha,
I didn't want any of this, believe me.

10:53.963 --> 10:56.172
-Please listen...
-What are you doing here?

10:56.838 --> 10:58.047
Come on!

10:59.672 --> 11:01.922
Why are you here?

11:03.588 --> 11:04.797
What do you want?

11:06.088 --> 11:08.005
You have to come with me. Please.

11:09.922 --> 11:11.922
It's my fault everyone dies.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.255
-What?
-It's all going to blow in a few hours.

11:15.547 --> 11:19.922
Everything starts all over again.
The future starts. A new cycle.

11:20.005 --> 11:21.380
What are you talking about?

11:23.797 --> 11:25.505
Please believe me, please.

11:30.963 --> 11:32.797
You have to trust me, please.

11:49.547 --> 11:50.922
This is wrong.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.338
We're wrong.

11:57.463 --> 11:58.963
Please leave now.

12:02.130 --> 12:03.255
No.

12:08.088 --> 12:09.088
I can't let you go.

12:09.172 --> 12:10.505
You're hurting me.

12:10.588 --> 12:13.547
I saw you die once.
I won't let it happen again.

12:14.755 --> 12:15.755
Let me go.

12:15.838 --> 12:16.838
I can't.

12:23.005 --> 12:24.838
I promised you I'd make it right.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.380
I'm making it right.

12:32.672 --> 12:36.797
SIX HOURS TO THE APOCALYPSE

12:45.505 --> 12:46.755
Where's the device?

12:50.297 --> 12:51.963
Where's the fucking device?

12:53.172 --> 12:54.380
My mom has it.

12:57.505 --> 12:58.922
That's not right.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.838
It shouldn't happen this way.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.297
It's all my fault.

13:06.213 --> 13:08.297
Why didn't Noah tell me what to do?

13:09.213 --> 13:10.755
Why did he tell me it all?

13:11.963 --> 13:15.755
Explains the thing to me
and doesn't tell me what to do with it.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.005
Maybe you did
exactly what you were supposed to do.

13:21.380 --> 13:23.047
You showed us how it works.

13:23.422 --> 13:25.463
Maybe that was your sole task.

13:27.213 --> 13:28.297
Fuck!

13:30.213 --> 13:31.463
Fuck!

13:32.005 --> 13:33.297
Where are you going?

13:33.380 --> 13:34.713
To find the fucking device!

13:43.922 --> 13:45.088
Hello?

13:52.547 --> 13:53.630
Jonas?

14:01.963 --> 14:03.255
Jonas?

15:03.755 --> 15:06.422
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

15:14.755 --> 15:16.255
What's that?

15:16.630 --> 15:17.880
The passage.

15:18.922 --> 15:20.588
We're opening it again.

15:20.672 --> 15:22.547
You said you wanted to shut it.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.838
In the future.

15:24.922 --> 15:27.255
Or the past. Your future!

15:30.963 --> 15:35.172
It took me ages to accept having to be
part of the disaster I wanted to prevent.

15:36.630 --> 15:38.088
How do you know all this?

15:38.172 --> 15:39.297
In the last 12 months.

15:40.255 --> 15:41.922
You taught me everything,

15:43.005 --> 15:44.672
about the future and past.

15:45.630 --> 15:47.213
Everything that happened.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.588
Everything that will happen.

15:51.338 --> 15:52.880
There are two sides out there.

15:53.547 --> 15:55.672
Adam and Sic Mundus
want to create a new world.

15:56.047 --> 15:58.005
You and I want to save this one.

15:59.963 --> 16:01.255
Who's Adam?

16:57.255 --> 16:58.547
What is this?

16:58.630 --> 17:00.380
The only safe place.

17:03.213 --> 17:04.380
Please don't.

17:05.088 --> 17:06.338
Please.

17:07.213 --> 17:08.838
Why are you doing this?

17:09.630 --> 17:11.338
Because I know what happens today.

17:16.463 --> 17:17.922
The Mikkel story...

17:20.380 --> 17:21.547
is it true?

17:31.422 --> 17:32.672
Then I...

17:35.713 --> 17:37.505
I didn't want all this, Martha.

17:38.172 --> 17:39.880
You kept me alive.

17:40.547 --> 17:42.588
I'm still here because of you.

17:43.963 --> 17:47.422
Jonas will come back.
It'll all happen as it always has.

17:48.088 --> 17:50.922
But I can't stop hoping
I can change something.

17:51.713 --> 17:52.880
I have to.

17:54.422 --> 17:56.130
Jonas will come back?

17:58.963 --> 18:01.255
Promise me you won't leave this bunker.

18:02.713 --> 18:04.130
No matter what happens.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.380
I'm sorry.

18:46.463 --> 18:48.255
POLICE

18:53.130 --> 18:56.130
MISSING

18:58.755 --> 18:59.755
Charlotte?

19:00.838 --> 19:03.797
-I thought you were still sick.
-Is Clausen here?

19:03.880 --> 19:05.505
No. Clausen arrested Aleksander.

19:05.922 --> 19:08.172
He got a search warrant
for the power plant.

19:08.255 --> 19:09.713
He's headed there.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.088
Charlotte!

19:16.088 --> 19:18.505
I... I have to tell you something.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.838
On the nuclear power plant grounds,

19:37.422 --> 19:39.838
Aleksander buried something
in concrete there.

19:42.172 --> 19:43.172
Radioactive waste.

19:45.338 --> 19:46.922
I helped him do it.

19:49.047 --> 19:50.380
I'm sorry.

19:51.672 --> 19:52.922
That triggers it.

19:53.547 --> 19:55.255
-What?
-It's all connected.

19:55.338 --> 19:58.338
He said it all has to do
with the power plant.

19:59.130 --> 20:01.505
-Jonas knew it.
-You found Jonas?

20:01.588 --> 20:03.588
No, he traveled back from the future.

20:05.005 --> 20:06.422
We have to go.

20:09.088 --> 20:10.130
WÃ¶ller!

20:11.088 --> 20:12.338
Come on.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.255
FOR CHARLOTTE

20:16.338 --> 20:19.213
Charlotte, where are you?
Is Franziska with you?

20:20.255 --> 20:22.255
Call me once you get this.

20:43.047 --> 20:44.338
We're going now.

20:45.005 --> 20:46.255
Where?

20:46.755 --> 20:48.505
I no longer know

20:49.047 --> 20:50.713
what I should believe.

20:51.005 --> 20:52.838
But Noah said

20:52.922 --> 20:56.297
only the people in the bunker

20:58.338 --> 20:59.630
survive.

21:04.088 --> 21:06.172
What about Mom and Franziska?

21:09.672 --> 21:12.838
It'll all be okay.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.672
FOUR HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

21:24.755 --> 21:28.005
<i>I don't quite get</i>
<i>what you hope to achieve here.</i>

21:28.838 --> 21:32.588
The site is huge.
Controlled shutdown takes place tomorrow.

21:32.672 --> 21:36.172
My mother always said,
"Just because a task seems too big

21:36.255 --> 21:38.047
doesn't mean it's unsolvable."

21:40.130 --> 21:42.047
What's behind this door?

21:42.130 --> 21:43.255
The...

21:43.338 --> 21:46.588
The spent fuel pool for the old reactor.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.922
It's been out of use since the 90s.

21:49.005 --> 21:50.672
I'd like to see it.

21:52.755 --> 21:56.172
You can't just go see it.
There's residual radiation.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.838
Anyway,
I don't think you'll find anything there.

22:26.172 --> 22:28.797
PHOTO ALBUM
MICHAEL

23:11.213 --> 23:13.797
JUST AFTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION

23:17.505 --> 23:19.130
Katharina?

23:26.047 --> 23:27.547
How does this machine work?

23:34.880 --> 23:36.422
Where did you get it?

23:39.130 --> 23:40.755
How can I bring Mikkel back?

23:42.547 --> 23:45.505
Even if I explain it to you,
it's impossible.

23:46.588 --> 23:48.588
You don't want him to return.

23:49.422 --> 23:53.088
-Because then you'd no longer exist.
-I wish it were so simple.

23:54.922 --> 23:57.297
Things in the past can't be changed.

23:57.963 --> 24:00.338
Mikkel can't return
because I already exist.

24:01.755 --> 24:04.088
Mikkel belongs here, and not you!

24:04.672 --> 24:06.422
You shouldn't exist at all.

24:07.963 --> 24:09.005
Yes.

24:11.547 --> 24:13.630
I'd trade my life for his anytime.

24:15.255 --> 24:18.255
But I can't die,
because my future already exists.

24:20.047 --> 24:22.880
You'd be just as incapable
of bringing Mikkel back.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.797
Then why did you return?

24:28.047 --> 24:30.172
I tried to prevent the origin.

24:31.797 --> 24:33.588
But it's impossible. I can't.

24:34.297 --> 24:35.922
Adam is the endpoint.

24:36.547 --> 24:39.755
Maybe I can't prevent myself
from becoming what he is.

24:40.463 --> 24:42.588
But I can stop what has become of me.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.588
I know you lied to me.

25:11.088 --> 25:13.380
You never meant to save them.

25:14.005 --> 25:15.422
None of them.

25:20.422 --> 25:23.088
We can't escape our fate.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.838
Neither you nor I.

25:31.422 --> 25:33.922
You're not waging war against God.

25:36.130 --> 25:38.130
You're waging it against humanity.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.547
Here are the last pages.

25:45.963 --> 25:47.463
You used me.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.838
You had me do all these things,

25:52.422 --> 25:54.213
but I know now what I must do.

25:57.463 --> 25:58.880
Claudia was right.

26:00.047 --> 26:02.713
You still don't understand
how this game is played.

26:06.255 --> 26:07.838
What are you waiting for?

26:14.630 --> 26:16.922
Time plays its cruel game with us.

26:17.463 --> 26:20.047
You believe your destiny is to kill me.

26:20.838 --> 26:25.338
But that is as little your fate
as it is mine to die here and now.

26:31.838 --> 26:35.547
Only when we're free of all emotion
are we truly free.

26:36.880 --> 26:41.672
Only when one is ready to sacrifice
what one holds dearest.

26:43.505 --> 26:45.255
Charlotte is your daughter.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.088
She is Elisabeth's daughter.

26:48.505 --> 26:50.005
And her mother.

26:54.130 --> 26:55.797
No human is without guilt.

26:57.505 --> 27:01.255
None of them have earned
a place in your paradise.

27:13.922 --> 27:15.255
Agnes?

27:18.713 --> 27:19.963
This knot

27:20.755 --> 27:23.047
can only be undone

27:23.130 --> 27:26.255
by destroying it entirely.

27:29.713 --> 27:33.838
We cannot escape our destiny.

28:49.380 --> 28:50.838
What is happening?

28:50.922 --> 28:52.588
This is time.

28:56.422 --> 28:59.088
We connect past and future.

29:50.880 --> 29:52.213
What's that?

29:52.547 --> 29:55.588
It's Jonas. He opened the passage again.

29:56.338 --> 29:58.422
The thing Mikkel went through?

29:59.422 --> 30:00.797
Yes.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.213
Martha.

30:21.838 --> 30:24.922
Is everything okay?
Who locked you in here?

30:25.922 --> 30:28.297
Hey, wait!
Martha, you can't go out there!

30:28.380 --> 30:29.505
Martha!

30:41.130 --> 30:42.630
-What was that?
-Fuck.

30:42.713 --> 30:45.380
It was the same noise
as the one from in the cave.

30:45.463 --> 30:47.380
-Fuck.
-You got it?

30:48.922 --> 30:50.880
The device isn't up there.

30:50.963 --> 30:53.297
And Mom isn't here. Neither is Martha.

30:55.713 --> 30:57.297
Do you think she's with him?

30:58.255 --> 30:59.463
With Jonas?

31:00.630 --> 31:03.505
Noah was right.
He was right about everything.

31:03.797 --> 31:05.422
I told you guys.

31:05.505 --> 31:08.005
Jonas is to blame for all this shit.

31:19.963 --> 31:21.630
Where are we going?

31:34.755 --> 31:37.880
You have to take it to the bunker.
Near Helge's cabin.

31:38.922 --> 31:40.505
You don't have much time.

31:42.672 --> 31:44.088
And you?

31:47.672 --> 31:49.338
I have to find my mother.

31:50.130 --> 31:51.380
And Martha.

31:55.963 --> 31:57.047
Jonas!

32:03.672 --> 32:08.422
TWO HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

32:09.005 --> 32:11.463
Hey, Martha! Call me back.

32:14.130 --> 32:15.630
Neither is answering.

32:26.630 --> 32:29.005
My father is with Elisabeth in the bunker.

32:30.088 --> 32:32.505
-He says I should join him.
-In the bunker?

32:33.755 --> 32:34.755
Shit.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.463
Something's happening.

32:39.380 --> 32:41.005
I have to go there.

32:43.838 --> 32:47.338
If they're not here in 30 minutes,
we'll go join your father.

32:57.630 --> 32:59.922
Where are Mom and Franziska?

33:02.047 --> 33:03.797
I don't know.

33:07.963 --> 33:10.922
So Noah says he's your father
and comes from the future.

33:11.005 --> 33:12.963
No, from the past.

33:13.047 --> 33:16.255
And he said the apocalypse
will begin here in Winden.

33:16.338 --> 33:17.422
Today!

33:17.505 --> 33:20.797
And you think it all has to do
with the barrels.

33:49.463 --> 33:52.547
-What is that?
-The cooling pool for the old reactor.

33:53.005 --> 33:56.463
It has already been sealed
to become part of the green field.

33:56.547 --> 33:57.672
When?

33:58.297 --> 33:59.588
I, um...

34:00.505 --> 34:01.672
don't know exactly.

34:02.422 --> 34:04.255
But it's nothing unusual.

34:04.338 --> 34:06.088
Sealing off the old reactor

34:06.588 --> 34:08.755
is a step in the dismantling process.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.588
I want it broken open.

34:13.047 --> 34:14.547
Now?

34:15.213 --> 34:16.297
Now.

34:17.713 --> 34:21.380
You can't keep him there another night.
He's done nothing wrong.

34:21.838 --> 34:23.588
This is all nonsense.

34:29.172 --> 34:31.130
When can I visit Aleksander?

34:35.047 --> 34:36.422
I understand.

34:42.088 --> 34:43.505
Regina?

35:02.630 --> 35:04.380
Please don't be afraid.

35:07.380 --> 35:08.838
It's really me.

35:20.338 --> 35:22.005
I'm so sorry.

35:24.213 --> 35:26.088
I didn't want to just leave that way.

35:27.963 --> 35:29.463
I'll explain it to you.

35:32.838 --> 35:34.713
Buy you have to come with me now.

35:43.755 --> 35:45.172
Regina.

35:49.172 --> 35:50.880
I'm so sorry.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.130
Noah?

36:22.588 --> 36:24.213
You look different.

36:26.463 --> 36:28.547
Different to when I saw you last.

36:30.005 --> 36:31.422
He sent you.

36:32.547 --> 36:33.630
Adam.

36:34.380 --> 36:37.422
I always wondered when you became him.

36:37.505 --> 36:39.213
I won't do that.

36:39.297 --> 36:41.630
I'll never do what he did.

36:43.213 --> 36:45.422
He said you'd say something like that.

36:47.838 --> 36:49.922
He also said we'd become friends.

36:52.047 --> 36:53.630
Before you betray me.

36:56.963 --> 36:58.797
Why do you follow him?

36:59.463 --> 37:01.172
Why did you follow her?

37:02.630 --> 37:03.672
Claudia.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.505
Because we want to believe.

37:06.588 --> 37:09.838
Because we cling to the salvation
promised to us.

37:13.380 --> 37:14.713
If you kill him...

37:18.380 --> 37:20.630
you kill all hope of salvation.

37:22.422 --> 37:24.047
He's the savior.

37:29.088 --> 37:30.630
You're the savior.

37:40.172 --> 37:42.755
-What is that?
-Read it.

37:44.213 --> 37:45.672
It's from Martha.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.338
This is impossible.

38:08.505 --> 38:10.005
You must save them.

38:11.505 --> 38:14.713
Bartosz, Magnus and Franziska.

38:16.047 --> 38:17.588
And later me and Agnes.

38:19.755 --> 38:23.088
The loop has to be closed
so the next cycle begins.

38:24.797 --> 38:26.713
As the prophesy dictates.

38:27.547 --> 38:29.297
And so Martha can live.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.588
No, this can't be.

38:38.297 --> 38:39.463
Martha!

40:37.047 --> 40:38.047
Regina.

40:48.547 --> 40:49.838
You're her.

40:53.505 --> 40:54.588
You're Claudia.

41:16.172 --> 41:18.130
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

41:43.380 --> 41:45.088
Your colleague is in the old reactor.

42:24.172 --> 42:25.297
Mom?

42:31.713 --> 42:32.922
Jonas?

42:47.963 --> 42:49.547
You're back.

42:53.005 --> 42:54.588
You really came back.

42:58.672 --> 43:00.338
I've been looking for you.

43:03.172 --> 43:05.172
-I have to tell you something.
-I know.

43:05.922 --> 43:07.130
Everything.

43:08.213 --> 43:10.338
I know why you said that
back then in the rain.

43:11.130 --> 43:12.422
Mikkel...

43:12.505 --> 43:14.005
I know everything.

43:16.797 --> 43:18.463
It was you at the lake.

43:48.172 --> 43:50.047
We're a perfect match.

43:51.130 --> 43:52.713
Don't ever believe anything else.

44:17.172 --> 44:19.005
And so the circle closes.

44:22.213 --> 44:23.630
Jonas, who is that?

44:25.963 --> 44:27.838
Go on, tell her who I am.

44:35.297 --> 44:38.755
I told you that all the pieces
are in their places.

44:39.672 --> 44:41.672
All that's needed is a little push.

44:41.755 --> 44:43.255
You lied to me!

44:45.005 --> 44:46.880
You wanted it all to happen again.

44:47.505 --> 44:48.797
You're the trigger.

44:49.380 --> 44:51.255
We're all the trigger.

44:52.130 --> 44:54.088
Each and every one of us.

44:54.963 --> 44:56.463
Why do you want that?

44:57.547 --> 45:00.005
Why do you want the future to be repeated?

45:01.505 --> 45:05.672
Because what is created today
is the beginning of the end.

45:06.713 --> 45:08.380
The dark matter,

45:08.463 --> 45:12.505
it has to be created so that in the future
I can lead it to its new purpose.

45:13.922 --> 45:15.380
The end of this world.

45:18.297 --> 45:19.922
I am the trigger.

45:22.213 --> 45:24.088
Only not of what you think.

45:28.672 --> 45:30.713
I am the trigger

45:31.838 --> 45:35.213
that will make you become what I am today.

45:54.838 --> 45:55.713
It's okay.

45:56.630 --> 45:58.505
It will all be okay.

45:58.588 --> 46:00.963
Some pain is unforgettable.

46:03.838 --> 46:06.255
You will carry this pain for the rest
of your life.

46:06.338 --> 46:07.922
Look at me.

46:09.713 --> 46:11.963
Until you're finally ready

46:13.672 --> 46:15.130
to let go.

46:19.755 --> 46:21.380
Of her, too.

46:31.755 --> 46:33.088
You can stop me.

46:35.963 --> 46:37.755
Or try to save her.

46:45.463 --> 46:47.422
You'll know what to do.

46:54.672 --> 46:56.422
Please, don't go.

46:57.630 --> 46:58.755
Martha!

47:00.047 --> 47:01.505
Please don't go.

47:04.213 --> 47:05.213
Please don't.

47:18.005 --> 47:19.380
Don't open it!

47:20.005 --> 47:23.255
Stop! Don't open it! It's a mistake.

47:24.255 --> 47:27.005
No, Mrs. Doppler. It's our elephant.

47:27.088 --> 47:29.130
You have no idea
what this is really about.

47:30.505 --> 47:33.380
-What is it this really about?
-Not about the missing people.

47:33.838 --> 47:35.380
It's about the future,

47:35.463 --> 47:37.005
the past

47:37.088 --> 47:38.922
and how it's all interconnected.

47:41.213 --> 47:42.422
-Open it.
-Please don't!

47:42.505 --> 47:44.630
-Open it.
-No, it's a mistake!

47:55.797 --> 47:58.005
Magnus! Open up!

47:58.088 --> 47:59.172
Magnus!

47:59.255 --> 48:00.588
Open the door!

48:00.672 --> 48:01.713
Hurry!

48:02.505 --> 48:03.672
Magnus!

48:05.047 --> 48:07.588
What the hell? Who are you? Hey!

48:10.963 --> 48:13.463
It's him. It's you.

48:14.213 --> 48:15.297
You're Jonas.

48:16.172 --> 48:17.630
It's all your fault.

48:17.713 --> 48:19.630
Yes, it is my fault, all of it.

48:19.713 --> 48:22.005
-But I'm here to save you.
-Save us from what?

48:22.797 --> 48:25.172
-From the apocalypse.
-What apocalypse?

48:26.172 --> 48:27.797
What about Martha?

48:29.630 --> 48:31.047
What about Martha?

49:36.755 --> 49:38.505
FOR CHARLOTTE

51:32.297 --> 51:33.755
Mom.

51:36.005 --> 51:37.338
Elisabeth.

51:51.755 --> 51:53.338
It's beginning.

51:59.338 --> 52:00.963
Where are we going?

52:39.588 --> 52:40.838
I promise you.

52:42.338 --> 52:43.630
I'll make it right.

53:17.172 --> 53:19.255
I'm not who you think I am.

53:24.755 --> 53:28.297
-Wait. Martha, that's not possible, I...
-We don't have time.

53:35.922 --> 53:39.047
I'll explain it to you later.
We have to go now.

53:49.672 --> 53:51.005
What time are you from?

53:53.297 --> 53:55.505
The question isn't from what time,

53:56.463 --> 53:57.880
but from what world.

54:09.963 --> 54:11.630
