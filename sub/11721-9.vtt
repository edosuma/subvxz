was suffering

08:34.248 --> 08:36.115
from high-altitude
pulmonary edema

08:36.116 --> 08:38.784
due to the elevation,
but then

08:38.785 --> 08:41.754
due to the lack of grayness
or blue in the limbs,

08:41.756 --> 08:43.422
I was able to rule that out.
Actually,

08:43.424 --> 08:45.891

<i>all</i> natural causes.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.631
Well... pinpoint pupils

08:52.633 --> 08:55.200

10:47.471 --> 10:48.737
on old contusions
that are clearly

10:48.739 --> 10:50.438
unrelated to the
cause of death?

10:52.842 --> 10:54.509
That's right.
Walk away.

10:54.511 --> 10:55.877
Let the adults
do their work.

10:55.879 --> 10:58.680
I don't know
how you put up with him.

10:58.682 --> 11:00.849
Okay, Max,
I want to know.

11:00.851 --> 11:02.750
What is it between you two?
Tell me.

11:03.586 --> 11:05.386
Well, it's private.

11:05.388 --> 11:07.822
And to discuss this
in a professional environment

11:07.824 --> 11:09.223
is highly inappropriate.

11:09.225 --> 11:10.558
I don't care.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.360
Fine, if you must know,

11:12.362 --> 11:14.762
it was over a certain woman.

11:14.764 --> 11:16.097
Enough said.

11:16.099 --> 11:17.799
What's going on
with our John Doe?

11:17.801 --> 11:19.233
Well...
To begin with,

11:19.235 --> 11:21.736
the autopsy
confirmed my suspicions.

11:21.738 --> 11:24.672
The C.O.D.
was indeed poisoning.

11:24.674 --> 11:26.174
What kind of poison?
SANJEET: We don't know yet.

11:26.176 --> 11:27.708
The initial tox screen
came back negative.

11:27.710 --> 11:28.743
MAX:
But we were able

11:28.745 --> 11:30.711
to narrow down
the spectrum of...

11:30.713 --> 11:32.480
Hold on. “We”?

11:33.715 --> 11:35.116
Excuse me.

11:35.118 --> 11:37.985
Dr. Dhawan was able
to narrow down

11:37.987 --> 11:39.720
the spectrum
of possible poisons.

11:39.722 --> 11:42.256
I discovered some
excess substances

11:42.258 --> 11:43.858
in the victim's lungs.

11:43.860 --> 11:46.894
There's only a few poisons
that could cause that result.

11:46.896 --> 11:48.829
Of course, additional tests
will need to be performed

11:48.831 --> 11:50.765
to determine which was
the exact poison utilized

11:50.767 --> 11:51.866
to kill our victim.

11:51.868 --> 11:54.869
All early indications point
to TCVP.

11:54.871 --> 11:56.937
Or perhaps a couple dozen
other substances.

11:56.939 --> 11:58.873
Okay, okay, okay.
Do we at least know

11:58.875 --> 12:01.442
how this mystery poison
entered this gentleman's body?

12:01.444 --> 12:03.077
SANJEET: Due to the lack
of injection marks

12:03.079 --> 12:04.812
on the victim's body

12:04.814 --> 12:07.381
and any indication that it was
absorbed through the skin,

12:07.383 --> 12:10.417
I can say with confidence
it was likely ingested.

12:10.419 --> 12:13.454
So the killer spiked something
that he ate?

12:13.456 --> 12:16.056
Or drank. We'll know more once
we analyze his stomach contents.

12:16.058 --> 12:18.859
With any luck, we'll find
some traces of the poison.

12:18.861 --> 12:21.528
And even if we don't,
knowing the victim's last meal

12:21.530 --> 12:23.731
could lead
to some valuable information,

12:23.733 --> 12:25.599
possibly leading to an I.D.

12:25.601 --> 12:29.703
Well, gentlemen, I'm sure
our good doctor means well.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.705
However, analyzing
the stomach contents

12:31.707 --> 12:33.207
could take hours.

12:33.209 --> 12:37.244
I, on the other hand, already
have an idea who our victim is.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.813
Well, do you have his name?

12:39.815 --> 12:41.715
Well, something close enough.

12:44.586 --> 12:48.188
Gentlemen, please note
which part of the rider's body

12:48.190 --> 12:51.325
is utilized the most.

12:54.128 --> 12:56.163
The wrist, the elbows,
the shoulders,

12:56.165 --> 12:58.265
the hips
and the groin.

12:58.267 --> 13:00.167
Our John Doe,
at one time or another,

13:00.169 --> 13:02.803
had suffered fractures
in all of these parts.

13:02.805 --> 13:05.572
Furthermore, I found traces
of rosin on his hands.

13:05.574 --> 13:06.973
Rosin is

13:06.975 --> 13:09.509
commonly used
on a rider's glove

13:09.511 --> 13:12.312
to enhance the bull rope grip.

13:12.314 --> 13:15.215
All of these observations lead
to an obvious conclusion,

13:15.217 --> 13:16.182
that...

13:16.184 --> 13:17.751
The guy was a bull rider.

13:18.786 --> 13:22.889
♪ ♪
(announcer speaking indistinctly)

13:22.891 --> 13:25.859
(cheering and applause)

13:37.304 --> 13:39.873
ANNOUNCER: Let's hear it for St. Nick,
everybody.

13:39.875 --> 13:42.242
The old man's still got it.

13:42.244 --> 13:44.744
I got to say, I'm a little
bummed I didn't get to see Mars.

13:44.746 --> 13:46.713
Then you should've taken
the earlier flight.

13:46.715 --> 13:49.115
You didn't miss anything.
Trust me.

13:49.117 --> 13:50.250
Wow,

13:50.252 --> 13:52.518
this really brings back
some memories.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.853
Yeah?
Yeah, my dad

13:53.855 --> 13:54.954
used to take us to the rodeo

13:54.956 --> 13:56.756
when I was a kid
whenever it came into town.

13:56.758 --> 13:58.558
Used to sit right behind
the bucking chutes.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.692
Get to see the bulls up close.

13:59.694 --> 14:00.927
Some of the <i> paniolos</i>
even taught me

14:00.929 --> 14:02.362
how to handle a rope.
Huh.

14:02.364 --> 14:03.863
I got to say, I don't
see the appeal.

14:03.865 --> 14:06.599
That's just me, personally,
though, you know?

14:06.601 --> 14:08.167
Can I help you, Officers?
Uh, yeah.

14:08.169 --> 14:09.702
We're with Five-O.
Um, who's, uh...

14:09.704 --> 14:10.736
who's in charge
around here?

14:10.738 --> 14:13.239
Looking at 'em.
Al Mokuau.

14:13.241 --> 14:15.942
I organized
today's event.

14:15.944 --> 14:17.143
How you doing?
Good to meet you.

14:17.145 --> 14:18.978
This is Jill Kuikahi.
She manages all our riders.

14:18.980 --> 14:20.179
Hi. How do you do?
Hi.

14:20.181 --> 14:21.781
What can we do for you?

14:23.383 --> 14:25.117
Do you know
this man?

14:25.119 --> 14:26.185
Oh, my God.

14:26.187 --> 14:27.987
MOKUAU:
That's Keone Maka.

14:27.989 --> 14:30.756
He's one of our riders.
What-what happened?

14:30.758 --> 14:33.292
He was found dead this morning
up on Mauna Loa.

14:33.294 --> 14:35.027
I can't believe this.

14:35.029 --> 14:36.395
DANNY:
Do you have, uh...

14:36.397 --> 14:39.165
uh, any idea why he
might have been up there?

14:39.167 --> 14:41.133
No.

14:41.135 --> 14:44.637
Keone's day job
was delivering hay and feed

14:44.639 --> 14:45.905
to ranches on the island.

14:45.907 --> 14:48.507
Most of his stops were made
in the early morning.

14:48.509 --> 14:49.642
Doesn't make
any sense he'd be

14:49.644 --> 14:50.609
anywhere near Mauna Loa.

14:50.611 --> 14:51.877
Can you tell us how he died?

14:51.879 --> 14:52.945
GROVER:
All indications point

14:52.947 --> 14:54.380
to him being poisoned.

14:55.215 --> 14:57.116
You're saying
Keone was murdered?

14:57.118 --> 14:58.717
Yeah.
KONO: Can you think

14:58.719 --> 15:00.519
of anyone who may have wanted
to hurt him?

15:02.689 --> 15:04.690
(sighs)

15:04.692 --> 15:06.191
Luke.

15:06.193 --> 15:08.894
Luke? Okay.
Who's, uh... who's Luke?

15:08.896 --> 15:10.195
Luke Pakele.

15:10.197 --> 15:12.097
He's one of the other riders.

15:12.099 --> 15:13.599
MOKUAU:
A couple weeks back,

15:13.601 --> 15:16.602
Keone came forward
and accused Luke of cheating.

15:16.604 --> 15:19.171
Claimed that Luke was
injecting bulls with steroids.

15:19.173 --> 15:20.539
DANNY: Injecting bulls
with steroids.

15:20.541 --> 15:22.307
Why would he do that?
In bull riding,

15:22.309 --> 15:23.642
half your score
is based upon

15:23.644 --> 15:25.143
how long you stay
on the bull.

15:25.145 --> 15:27.813
The other half is
how much it bucks.

15:27.815 --> 15:29.581
A more aggressive bull
means more points for the rider.

15:29.583 --> 15:30.816
Oh.
MOKUAU: Exactly.

15:30.818 --> 15:31.984
We took the accusation
seriously,

15:31.986 --> 15:33.318
so we checked out
Luke's bull.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.420
Sure enough,
Keone was right.

15:35.422 --> 15:37.422
The bull tested
positive for steroids.

15:37.424 --> 15:39.224
Okay. Then what happened?

15:39.226 --> 15:41.960
We fired Luke
the next day.

15:41.962 --> 15:44.196
He also had to forfeit
some of his prize money.

15:44.198 --> 15:46.765
I can't imagine
Luke was too happy about that.

15:46.767 --> 15:48.633
No, ma'am.

15:48.635 --> 15:50.936
CHIN:
So, I ran the name Luke Pakele.

15:50.938 --> 15:52.571
The guy's been busted twice

15:52.573 --> 15:53.705
for cattle rustling.

15:53.707 --> 15:54.940
GROVER:
Got a last known address?

15:54.942 --> 15:57.008
Yeah, he lives
in the Kalapana Lava Gardens.

15:57.010 --> 15:58.076
I'm texting you
the exact address right now.

15:58.078 --> 15:59.444
Lava gardens?

15:59.446 --> 16:00.912
That like, uh, molten lava?

16:00.914 --> 16:02.314
You're gonna love it.
Uh-huh.

16:02.316 --> 16:03.882
GROVER: All right,
I'm gonna get a CSU team

16:03.884 --> 16:06.051
over to Keone's house.
If Luke is our guy,

16:06.053 --> 16:08.053
he could've poisoned something
in Keone's house.

16:08.055 --> 16:09.287
Maybe we'll find out
what it is.

16:09.289 --> 16:10.588
All right. Good luck.

16:10.590 --> 16:11.890
Mahalo, cuz.

16:12.758 --> 16:14.059
Hey, Pua. Howzit?

16:14.061 --> 16:15.860
Lieutenant Kelly.

16:16.695 --> 16:18.596
Can I help you with something?

16:18.598 --> 16:20.665
Actually, I'm looking
for Commander McGarrett

16:20.667 --> 16:22.000
and Detective Williams.

16:22.002 --> 16:23.301
Ah, you're out of luck.

16:23.303 --> 16:24.903
Commander McGarrett's
in meetings with the governor,

16:24.905 --> 16:27.205
and Detective Williams is on
Hawai'i Island working a case.

16:27.207 --> 16:30.842
Unavailable. Interesting.

16:30.844 --> 16:34.145
Do you happen to know where
they were this morning?

16:34.147 --> 16:37.181
(chuckles) Actually, no, Pua.
I don't keep tabs on 'em.

16:38.183 --> 16:40.151
What's this about?
I'm not at liberty

16:40.153 --> 16:42.320
to say. Sorry.

16:42.322 --> 16:44.756
Official police business.

16:44.758 --> 16:45.957
Pua, I am police.

16:45.959 --> 16:48.126
Please have
Commander McGarrett

16:48.128 --> 16:51.429
and Detective Williams contact
me as soon as they can.

16:51.431 --> 16:52.263
Seriously?

16:52.265 --> 16:53.464
Thank you for your time

16:53.466 --> 16:56.634
and your cooperation. Aloha.

16:58.403 --> 17:01.405
Aloha.

17:21.660 --> 17:23.627
I don't get it.

17:23.628 --> 17:26.497
Why would anybody on the planet
want to live out here?

17:26.499 --> 17:28.398
Well, some people crave
a little adventure.

17:28.401 --> 17:29.967
Plus, the real estate's cheap.

17:29.969 --> 17:32.403
Oh. That's...

17:34.072 --> 17:36.607
Luke?
Luke Pakele?

17:36.609 --> 17:38.108
Five-O.

17:38.110 --> 17:39.510
We need to talk.

17:39.512 --> 17:41.812
Where is he running to?

17:58.830 --> 18:00.964
(grunting)

18:09.507 --> 18:11.041
Wow.

18:11.043 --> 18:12.876
Nice roping, cowgirl.

18:12.878 --> 18:15.712
Not even my best time.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.381
All right, Luke, come on.
Talk to me.

18:26.383 --> 18:28.850
You go from, uh, stealing cattle
to killing cowboys?

18:28.852 --> 18:30.351
What the hell are
you talking about?

18:30.353 --> 18:31.552
I never killed no cowboy.

18:31.554 --> 18:34.522
Okay, well, look, I, uh...
I got, uh, one cowboy

18:34.524 --> 18:36.891
in the morgue, and you're
the only one with motive

18:36.893 --> 18:38.226
to put him there.

18:38.228 --> 18:39.861
Keone's dead?

18:39.863 --> 18:41.429
He was poisoned.

18:41.431 --> 18:42.663
And you think I did it?

18:42.665 --> 18:44.098
The guy
got you fired.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.466
Cost you a lot of money.

18:45.468 --> 18:47.368
I imagine it made you pretty angry.
Yeah.

18:47.370 --> 18:48.703
Yeah, I was pissed.

18:48.705 --> 18:50.071
But I didn't off the guy.

18:50.073 --> 18:52.073
Okay, then why'd you run
when we showed up?

18:52.075 --> 18:54.709
Pretty sure she's
about to tell you.

18:55.544 --> 18:57.411
So, this guy,

18:57.413 --> 18:59.413
definitely making
Santa's “naughty” list.

18:59.415 --> 19:02.350
Stanozolol, oxandrolone,

19:02.352 --> 19:04.952
andro. This
is not good, Luke.

19:04.954 --> 19:07.028
Definitely enough
steroids to put you away for a while.

19:07.029 --> 19:09.256
I don't care
about this, okay?

19:09.258 --> 19:11.158
I really don't. I want...
I want to know about the murder.

19:11.160 --> 19:13.027
(phone rings)
I told you, I didn't kill him.

19:13.029 --> 19:14.029
Hold that thought.

19:14.030 --> 19:15.663
GROVER:
All right, you ready for this?

19:15.665 --> 19:17.898
We show up at Keone's place
only to find out

19:17.900 --> 19:19.200
somebody's already been here.

19:19.202 --> 19:21.469
I got evidence of forced entry
at the front door.

19:21.471 --> 19:23.037
Inside the house,
the place has been

19:23.039 --> 19:25.139
completely tossed, and some
stuff seems to be missing.

19:25.141 --> 19:27.041
I spoke with
the next door neighbor,

19:27.043 --> 19:29.310
who said she walked
by the place this morning.

19:29.312 --> 19:30.544
Everything seemed normal.

19:30.546 --> 19:32.446
So this break-in likely happened
after the murder.

19:32.448 --> 19:33.448
Okay,

19:33.449 --> 19:35.049
so Luke doses Keone,
and then he

19:35.051 --> 19:37.885
comes back to rob him to make up
for some of the money he lost.

19:37.887 --> 19:40.187
That would be a viable theory,
except for a lot of

19:40.189 --> 19:41.355
the valuables are still here.

19:41.357 --> 19:43.657
Now, I see that there's been

19:43.659 --> 19:45.125
a computer tower
that's been stolen,

19:45.127 --> 19:47.528
but they left behind
a flat-screen and a stereo.

19:47.530 --> 19:50.397
They also neglected
to take a pretty nice camera,

19:50.399 --> 19:52.399
though it does look like
they swiped the memory card.

19:52.401 --> 19:54.268
KONO: So it looks like they were
after evidence of something.

19:54.270 --> 19:55.569
Exactly.

19:55.571 --> 19:59.439
I don't think this murder
was about revenge at all.

20:04.445 --> 20:06.580
Well, latest toxicology report
is back.

20:06.582 --> 20:09.416
And?
And you were wrong. Again.

20:09.418 --> 20:12.185
Our mystery poison is not TCVP.

20:14.322 --> 20:16.423
Aren't you done yet?

20:16.425 --> 20:19.493
Oh, actually, I was, uh,
texting Captain Grover

20:19.495 --> 20:21.995
to let him know,
based on my complete analysis

20:21.997 --> 20:25.265
of Keone Maka's stomach
contents, I was able to conclude

20:25.267 --> 20:27.467
that the yet-to-be-identified
poison

20:27.469 --> 20:29.402
was ingested in liquid form.

20:29.404 --> 20:31.404
So he can instruct
all the CSU

20:31.406 --> 20:34.007
to ignore any solid foods
in the house.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.910
Wow. Case-breaking discovery.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.346
Enjoy your digs, Doctor,

20:39.348 --> 20:42.315
but I am going to be the one
riding off into the sunset

20:42.317 --> 20:43.516
with the win.
Hmm.

20:43.518 --> 20:46.986
Well, at least
I'll still have Janice.

20:48.489 --> 20:51.524
You son of a bitch.

20:51.526 --> 20:54.127
How dare you speak her name.

20:56.130 --> 20:58.164
You stole her from me!
Oh, please,

20:58.166 --> 20:59.966
she was never yours to steal.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.669
And why are you still angry?
I'm the one who should be angry.

21:02.671 --> 21:05.571
What? What gives you the right
to be angry?

21:05.573 --> 21:08.841
Well, you told all our friends
your side of the story,

21:08.843 --> 21:10.476
painted me as a villain.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.545
And then they
all turned on me.

21:12.547 --> 21:14.347
I became a pariah.

21:14.349 --> 21:16.349
You betrayed my trust!

21:16.351 --> 21:19.652
But for the record, I never
told them to freeze you out.

21:19.654 --> 21:22.355
No, but you let it happen.

21:22.357 --> 21:24.557
I'm out of here.

21:24.559 --> 21:26.526
(door opens)

21:27.327 --> 21:29.529
(door closes)

21:41.708 --> 21:44.977
(rattling)

21:52.519 --> 21:54.186
KONO:
<i> I don't get it.</i>

21:54.188 --> 21:56.689
Why would this guy be keeping
a vial of blood in his fridge?

21:56.691 --> 21:59.458
I don't know, but he hid it.
Must mean it's important.

21:59.460 --> 22:00.593
I really wonder

22:00.595 --> 22:02.394
if it has something
to do with his murder.

22:02.396 --> 22:03.896
Uh, yeah, I hate to even say it,

22:03.898 --> 22:05.965
but the way this case
is going, I don't know

22:05.967 --> 22:08.133
if we're gonna make it
home by Christmas morning.

22:09.436 --> 22:11.537
Well, that's fantastic.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.139
I'm sorry.

22:14.141 --> 22:16.875
Uh-huh.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.343
Are you okay?

22:18.345 --> 22:20.012
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:20.014 --> 22:21.347
I'm fine.
Um, couple days ago,

22:21.349 --> 22:23.182
I overheard Grace talking
to one of her friends,

22:23.184 --> 22:25.584
and I think that the cat
is officially out of the bag.

22:25.586 --> 22:27.686
“Cat's out of the bag.”

22:27.688 --> 22:29.088
Yeah.
You know,

22:29.090 --> 22:30.589
I never really got that one.

22:30.591 --> 22:32.591
I mean, who puts a cat in a bag?

22:34.427 --> 22:36.595
I don't know.

22:36.597 --> 22:38.263
The point is, um, I-I think

22:38.265 --> 22:40.766
that she no longer believes,
um, in Santa Claus.

22:40.768 --> 22:42.267
In fact,
I'm pretty sure

22:42.269 --> 22:46.138
she probably hasn't believed
in him for a little while now.

22:46.140 --> 22:47.973
It was inevitable, Danny.

22:47.975 --> 22:50.242
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

22:50.244 --> 22:53.578
But, you know, there's this, um,
very, uh, special look

22:53.580 --> 22:54.980
that I get once a year.

22:54.982 --> 22:57.783
You see, I get to see her
come out of her room,

22:57.785 --> 22:59.618
and she has this glow

22:59.620 --> 23:00.952
when she sees
those presents

23:00.954 --> 23:03.088
that Santa left for her,
and I-I just think

23:03.090 --> 23:05.190
that Christmas is not gonna be
the same without...

23:05.192 --> 23:07.492
without it, so, there you go.

23:07.494 --> 23:09.995
Maybe you're looking
at it all wrong. I mean,

23:09.997 --> 23:11.463
maybe it's
not so bad.

23:11.465 --> 23:13.131
How is it not so bad?

23:13.133 --> 23:16.167
Well, because now, you don't
have to keep up the charade.

23:16.169 --> 23:17.535
Right? The ruse is over.

23:17.537 --> 23:19.504
Look, there's no more lying,
no more hiding the presents,

23:19.506 --> 23:21.272
no more sneaking around,
putting them under the tree.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.975
And the best thing of all is,
this year, for the first time,

23:23.977 --> 23:26.344
you'll get all the credit
for the awesome gifts.

23:26.346 --> 23:27.645
Right?
I don't... I don't care

23:27.647 --> 23:29.180
about the credit, though,
you know?

23:29.182 --> 23:31.016
Look, all I'm saying--

23:31.018 --> 23:32.484
it's okay for a kid Grace's age

23:32.486 --> 23:34.319
to not believe
in old Saint Nick.

23:36.088 --> 23:38.056
Yeah, I guess you're right.

23:38.058 --> 23:42.260
Maybe I'm just upset
that she's growing up so fast.

23:54.173 --> 23:56.441
(garbled radio transmission)

24:26.071 --> 24:29.273
♪ ♪

24:53.164 --> 24:54.798
STEVE:
<i> Hey.</i>

24:54.800 --> 24:56.934
Hey.
Danny filled me in on the case earlier.

24:56.936 --> 24:58.135
What's the latest?

24:58.137 --> 24:59.737
Well, Hawaii PD located
Keone Maka's truck

24:59.739 --> 25:01.572
about a mile from the
Mars training site.

25:01.574 --> 25:02.256
Okay.

25:02.280 --> 25:04.275
It looks like he lost control
and it went into a ravine.

25:04.276 --> 25:06.543
You know, I'm thinking that
the poison must have kicked in

25:06.545 --> 25:08.479
while he was driving.
Well, it makes sense.

25:08.481 --> 25:10.681
He gets disoriented, he, uh...
he crashes into the ditch,

25:10.683 --> 25:12.549
and then he goes looking
for help on foot.

25:12.551 --> 25:14.151
Their CSU is processing it now.

25:14.153 --> 25:16.820
Meantime, I think
I might have a lead.

25:16.822 --> 25:18.355
(computer chirps,
phone line ringing)

25:18.357 --> 25:20.691
Oh, by the way, Pua stopped by.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.693
He was looking
for you and Danny.

25:22.695 --> 25:23.961
He say why?

25:23.963 --> 25:26.496
No, but he was acting weird.

25:28.066 --> 25:29.733
Hey, what's up, cuz?

25:29.735 --> 25:31.735
Hey. So, I pulled Keone's
phone records, and I found

25:31.737 --> 25:32.903
something interesting.

25:32.905 --> 25:34.071
In the 48 hours

25:34.073 --> 25:35.605
before his death,

25:35.607 --> 25:37.441
he exchanged nine phone calls
with a man

25:37.443 --> 25:40.177
from Los Angeles
by the name of Jeff Harrison.

25:40.179 --> 25:41.712
Now, right after the last call,

25:41.714 --> 25:43.246
Harrison booked a flight
from LA to Kona

25:43.248 --> 25:45.215
that arrived
at 1:00 a.m. this morning.

25:45.217 --> 25:46.516
Okay, let me get this straight.

25:46.518 --> 25:48.451
So, nine phone calls
in two days.

25:48.453 --> 25:49.519
Then the guy
shows up, and

25:49.521 --> 25:50.854
a couple hours later,
Keone's dead?

25:50.856 --> 25:51.788
Mm-hmm.

25:51.790 --> 25:52.756
What do we know about Harrison?

25:52.758 --> 25:54.457
The guy's a horse trainer.

25:54.459 --> 25:56.526
No record, but he did end up

25:56.528 --> 25:58.762
in the news last year
when his racehorse,

25:58.764 --> 26:00.363
Urban Myth, went missing.

26:00.365 --> 26:01.631
I remember this. Urban Myth.

26:01.633 --> 26:04.267
Uh, he was a favorite
to win the Kentucky Derby.

26:04.269 --> 26:06.903
Night before the race,
horse disappears.

26:06.905 --> 26:09.773
Nobody ever heard anything,
no ransom demand, nothing.

26:09.775 --> 26:11.875
Guys, hold on a second.
I just got

26:11.877 --> 26:13.576
a hit back
on Harrison's credit card.

26:13.578 --> 26:16.513
Looks like he's staying
at a motel in Hamakua,

26:16.515 --> 26:17.947
and he just booked
a return flight

26:17.949 --> 26:19.716
back to L.A. that
leaves in a few hours.

26:19.718 --> 26:22.685
Well, he's gonna miss
that flight.

26:34.465 --> 26:37.066
(groans, panting)

26:37.068 --> 26:39.202
Help!

26:40.070 --> 26:41.537
Help me!

26:41.539 --> 26:43.539
(groaning)

26:43.541 --> 26:45.508
Help me! Help!

26:46.410 --> 26:47.510
Detective Williams with Five-O.

26:47.512 --> 26:49.445
I'm en route
with a possible poison victim.

26:49.447 --> 26:51.914
Early 60s, male.
ETA-- we're about

26:51.916 --> 26:53.950
three minutes out.
Need trauma team standing by.

26:53.952 --> 26:55.518
Danny, he's not gonna make it.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.220
(engine revving)

27:11.658 --> 27:12.791
All right,
let's get him inside.

27:12.793 --> 27:14.393
Start him on O2
and get a line in.

27:14.395 --> 27:16.161
Do we know
what kind of poison it was?

27:16.163 --> 27:17.729
No. We got somebody
working on it right now.

27:17.731 --> 27:19.798
Well, tell them to work fast.
They need to I.D. that toxin

27:19.800 --> 27:21.266
if we're gonna
save this man's life.

27:24.937 --> 27:28.740
Bag and tag anything Harrison
could have ingested.

27:28.742 --> 27:30.675
Toothpaste, mouthwash, gum,
coffee grounds--

27:30.677 --> 27:31.810
take it all.
Something in this room

27:31.812 --> 27:33.845
was laced with poison.
We need to find it!

27:33.847 --> 27:35.847
SANJEET:
Now!

28:00.206 --> 28:02.140
Max.

28:02.975 --> 28:04.375
Smell this.

28:04.377 --> 28:06.544
It could be
our delivery system.

28:06.546 --> 28:08.279
Smells like
liquid nicotine, right?

28:08.281 --> 28:09.881
It's faint, but I concur.

28:10.916 --> 28:13.418
We still need
to run it to be sure.

28:17.122 --> 28:19.324
Liquid nicotine would explain
the pinpoints in the eyes.

28:19.326 --> 28:20.725
And the mucus
in the lungs.

28:20.727 --> 28:23.728
And it wouldn't show up
in the standard tox screen.

28:23.730 --> 28:25.163
It's a good catch, Sanjeet.

28:26.298 --> 28:28.499
Weird. It... it sounded like
I just received a compliment,

28:28.501 --> 28:30.535
but that's impossible since

28:30.537 --> 28:33.671
you're the only other person
in the room. Hmm.

28:33.673 --> 28:35.573
Sanjeet, about
what happened...

28:35.575 --> 28:39.177
(machine chirping and beeping)

28:39.179 --> 28:42.046
I shouldn't have let our
friends turn against you.

28:42.048 --> 28:44.582
I didn't consider
the consequences.

28:44.584 --> 28:46.784
I'm sorry.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.354
Accepted.

28:52.124 --> 28:53.524
(chirping, trilling)

28:53.526 --> 28:54.992
Boom. Liquid nicotine!

28:56.028 --> 28:58.195
We were right.

28:58.197 --> 29:00.798
No.<i> You</i> were right.

29:01.867 --> 29:02.967
Make the call.

29:02.969 --> 29:04.235
We treated Harrison

29:04.237 --> 29:05.403
with Atropine and Pralidoxime.

29:05.405 --> 29:06.737
With some time to recover,

29:06.739 --> 29:08.672
he should be fine,
but he was lucky.

29:08.674 --> 29:10.875
Liquid nicotine,
highly concentrated,

29:10.877 --> 29:12.610
is extremely toxic.

29:12.612 --> 29:14.111
Just a teaspoon could be fatal.

29:14.113 --> 29:16.380
And thanks to e-cigarettes,
it's readily available.

29:16.382 --> 29:18.282
Okay, uh, when can
we speak to him?

29:18.284 --> 29:20.484
Uh, not for a couple hours
at least. We had to sedate him.

29:20.486 --> 29:21.986
But I'll let you know
when he comes to.

29:21.988 --> 29:22.953
Okay. Mahalo.

29:22.955 --> 29:23.988
GROVER:
Hey.

29:23.990 --> 29:25.522
Lab report just came in

29:25.524 --> 29:27.157
on that blood
from Keone's house.

29:27.159 --> 29:29.026
<i>Horse blood.</i>

29:29.028 --> 29:30.761
<i>They said it was drawn</i>

29:30.763 --> 29:32.463
no more than a couple
of days ago.

29:33.298 --> 29:35.232
Okay, wait a minute.

29:35.234 --> 29:36.800
Uh, Lou, do me a favor.

29:36.802 --> 29:38.368
See if you can get in touch

29:38.370 --> 29:39.636
with the American Thoroughbred
Association.

29:39.638 --> 29:41.004
All right? They should
have DNA profiles

29:41.006 --> 29:42.906
on all the professional
race horses.

29:42.908 --> 29:44.541
See if they can run that blood

29:44.543 --> 29:46.476
against the profile
of Urban Myth.

29:46.478 --> 29:47.311
Okay. What are you thinking?

29:47.313 --> 29:48.745
I'm thinking that this case

29:48.747 --> 29:50.681
has something to do
with that missing horse.

29:54.018 --> 29:55.986
Just take your time.

29:55.988 --> 29:58.155
Let me know
if you recognize anyone.

30:06.064 --> 30:09.499
Him... and him.

30:10.334 --> 30:12.769
Are you sure, ma'am?
100%.

30:12.771 --> 30:16.173
It was those two <i> haoles.</i>

30:16.175 --> 30:18.108
Thank you.

30:18.110 --> 30:19.609
Okay, thank you.

30:19.611 --> 30:21.611
You were right.
That was the ATA.

30:21.613 --> 30:25.115
Blood from Keone's--
direct DNA match to Urban Myth.

30:25.117 --> 30:26.816
Uh, okay.

30:26.818 --> 30:28.518
That sample was taken
a couple of days ago.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.387
That means that horse
is on this island.

30:30.389 --> 30:31.788
KONO: Keone must have
come into contact

30:31.790 --> 30:33.056
with him, and then reached out
to Harrison

30:33.058 --> 30:34.491
to let him know
he found his missing horse.

30:34.493 --> 30:35.625
Harrison tells Keone

30:35.627 --> 30:37.427
to get a blood sample
so they can confirm.

30:37.429 --> 30:38.561
DANNY: And then
whoever has Urban Myth

30:38.563 --> 30:39.629
realizes
that somebody's onto him,

30:39.631 --> 30:41.364
and realizes he has
to clip 'em both.

30:41.366 --> 30:43.333
We got to figure out
who's got that horse.

30:43.335 --> 30:45.168
KONO: Okay, thing
I don't get is this.

30:45.170 --> 30:47.604
Why would you steal a racehorse
and not ransom it?

30:47.606 --> 30:49.752
I mean, it's not like
you can run it anywhere.

30:49.776 --> 30:50.407
DANNY: No.

30:50.408 --> 30:53.710
But you could put it out
to stud, make a lot of money.

30:54.545 --> 30:56.079
Okay, so we checked, and there

30:56.081 --> 30:58.181
are only three stud farms
on the entire island.

30:58.183 --> 31:01.684
But one of them, Nakata Ranch,
was right on

31:01.686 --> 31:02.752
Keone's delivery route.

31:02.754 --> 31:03.920
That must be where
he saw Urban Myth.

31:03.922 --> 31:05.722
Okay, what do we know
about this place?

31:05.724 --> 31:08.424
Owner's name is Al Mokuau.

31:08.426 --> 31:09.859
That's the guy from the rodeo.

31:09.861 --> 31:11.294
That's the same guy who tried

31:11.296 --> 31:13.429
to pin this whole thing
on Luke Pakele.

31:14.398 --> 31:15.765
I say we round him up.

31:16.667 --> 31:17.667
What was that, a horse metaphor?

31:17.669 --> 31:20.236
Yes, sir.

31:24.475 --> 31:27.009
(neighing)

31:35.152 --> 31:37.486
Hey. Where's Mokuau?

31:37.488 --> 31:40.389
Took off about an hour ago.
Where's Urban Myth?

31:40.391 --> 31:42.325
I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:42.327 --> 31:43.793
Your boss-- where
was he headed?

31:43.795 --> 31:45.594
I'm not sure.
He was in a pickup,

31:45.596 --> 31:47.430
with a horse trailer
hitched to the back.

31:49.332 --> 31:50.666
He's getting rid
of the evidence.

32:02.338 --> 32:03.938
CHIN: <i> Guys, I tried pinging</i>
<i> Mokuau's cell phone,</i>

32:03.940 --> 32:06.207
but I'm not getting a signal.

32:06.209 --> 32:08.242
Think I might know
where he is.

32:08.244 --> 32:10.712
HPD just ran
Mokuau's financials.

32:10.714 --> 32:12.714
Yesterday he rented
a backhoe from

32:12.716 --> 32:14.415
a local construction
supply company.

32:14.417 --> 32:17.318
This morning, he had it
delivered to a property

32:17.320 --> 32:18.953
he owns in Waimea.

32:18.955 --> 32:21.289
He's going to kill
and bury that horse.

32:21.291 --> 32:23.424
Let's go.

32:24.460 --> 32:25.793
(engine starts)

32:33.268 --> 32:34.936
(horse neighs)

32:41.410 --> 32:43.110
(whinnies)

32:56.425 --> 32:58.626
(gunshot)
(groaning)

32:58.628 --> 33:01.195
(groans)
Don't move.

33:05.867 --> 33:07.301
(grunting)

33:08.837 --> 33:11.305
It's all right.
Easy, boy. You're all right.

33:11.307 --> 33:13.040
(grunting)
Turn around.

33:13.042 --> 33:14.508
(groans)
Give me your hands.

33:14.510 --> 33:17.444
Can't even move my arm.
I need an ambulance.

33:17.446 --> 33:19.546
Yeah? Well,
I'd call you one,

33:19.548 --> 33:21.615
but, you know, the service
out here is terrible.

33:21.617 --> 33:23.317
How about you, sis,
you got anything?

33:23.319 --> 33:24.518
Half a bar.

33:24.520 --> 33:26.386
I could bleed to death.

33:26.388 --> 33:27.821
Yeah, you could.

33:27.823 --> 33:30.724
And after all you've done,
that's a real consideration.

33:30.726 --> 33:32.459
Wha... All you got on me

33:32.461 --> 33:35.462
is stolen property and maybe
attempted animal cruelty.

33:35.464 --> 33:37.731
That's where you're wrong.

33:37.733 --> 33:39.800
On the way over here,
we got a phone call.

33:39.802 --> 33:42.302
Local crime lab-- seems
they found a travel mug

33:42.304 --> 33:44.905
inside Keone's truck.
Still had some

33:44.907 --> 33:46.974
coffee in it.
So they tested

33:46.976 --> 33:50.210
the mug and the coffee,
and guess what they found.

33:50.212 --> 33:52.713
Traces of liquid nicotine.

33:52.715 --> 33:54.548
So now we're thinking
that he got dosed

33:54.550 --> 33:57.184
when he came by
your ranch this morning.

33:57.186 --> 33:59.052
Lab also found
a fingerprint on the mug.

33:59.054 --> 34:01.421
And I'm guessing, once you
give us yours, it'll match.

34:01.423 --> 34:04.024
It was a gutsy play.
You know, you steal Urban Myth,

34:04.026 --> 34:06.560
bringing him way out here,
putting him out to stud.

34:06.562 --> 34:07.827
I think it probably
would have worked

34:07.829 --> 34:09.596
if Keone had not
recognized this horse.

34:09.598 --> 34:11.665
He was gonna
blow the whistle on you.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.466
And somehow you got wind of it.

34:13.467 --> 34:16.335
And you took him out
before he had a chance to.

34:16.338 --> 34:18.338
And then you went
over to his place

34:18.340 --> 34:20.739
and discovered he'd already
contacted Harrison.

34:20.742 --> 34:24.043
So now Harrison
had to go, too.

34:31.786 --> 34:33.953
Keone always went on
about how much

34:33.955 --> 34:39.058
he loved horse racing.

34:39.060 --> 34:41.995
taking pictures of him...

34:41.996 --> 34:44.964
I knew he recognize Urban Myth.

34:46.266 --> 34:48.935
Why couldn't he just
leave well enough alone?

34:48.937 --> 34:52.371
No one was looking
for that horse anymore.

34:52.373 --> 34:55.375
Urban Myth got to retire
to a big ranch.

34:56.342 --> 35:00.446
While the owners
got their insurance payout.

35:00.448 --> 35:03.549
Everyone had moved on.

35:04.918 --> 35:07.487
No one cared.

35:07.489 --> 35:09.722
Except Keone.

35:28.642 --> 35:30.710
Urban Myth was just
a foal when I started

35:30.712 --> 35:32.378
working with him.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.680
He had a spirit, even then.

35:34.682 --> 35:37.349
I've trained a lot of horses
over the years, but...

35:37.351 --> 35:38.684
Urban...

35:38.686 --> 35:40.886
Well, let's just say that

35:40.888 --> 35:43.255
some mean more to you.

35:47.394 --> 35:49.595
(neighs)

35:51.965 --> 35:53.599
(laughs)

35:53.601 --> 35:55.768
Oh, yeah.

36:13.653 --> 36:15.821
Hey, boy.

36:36.843 --> 36:39.010
How come you automatically
sit in the front?

36:39.012 --> 36:40.312
Well, look, hold on,
it's not automatic.

36:40.314 --> 36:41.913
First of all, I said
shotgun. Second of all,

36:41.915 --> 36:43.958
if you're gonna make a thing
about it, I'll sit in the back.

36:43.959 --> 36:44.895
I'm being polite.

36:44.919 --> 36:45.927
You can't... You're sitting
there last night,

36:45.928 --> 36:47.694
I got to fold myself up
like a pretzel...

36:47.695 --> 36:49.628
Hold on, wait.

36:50.764 --> 36:51.930
Hold on.

36:51.932 --> 36:55.034
Just a moment.
Here we go-- round 15.

36:55.036 --> 36:56.668
Don't ask.
SANJEET: Wait, just a moment.

37:00.006 --> 37:02.508
I, uh, just wanted to thank...

37:02.510 --> 37:04.443
Max for his, uh...

37:04.445 --> 37:07.579
his assistance
on this case.

37:07.581 --> 37:10.816
Your skills as a wingman
are unparalleled.

37:14.654 --> 37:15.854
Happy to assist, Sanjeet.

37:15.856 --> 37:17.155
Hey, you know,
us working together--

37:17.157 --> 37:20.726
it's given me
the opportunity to...

37:20.728 --> 37:22.794
make things right
between us.

37:22.796 --> 37:24.696
Merry Christmas.

37:25.798 --> 37:27.833
Wait. Is that...

37:39.545 --> 37:41.012
You two belong together.

37:41.014 --> 37:42.814
(gasps)

37:42.816 --> 37:44.483
Gentlemen, behold

37:44.485 --> 37:46.051
an original

37:46.053 --> 37:47.485
limited edition 1974

37:47.487 --> 37:49.487
Yeoman Janice Rand
action figure.

37:49.489 --> 37:51.289
DANNY:
So this beef

37:51.291 --> 37:53.224
between you two this whole time
has been about a, um...

37:53.226 --> 37:54.259
a Barbie doll?

37:54.261 --> 37:55.527
BOTH:
It's an action figure.

37:55.529 --> 37:56.895
(exhales)

37:56.897 --> 37:58.830
Ah. Okay, I'm done.

37:59.665 --> 38:01.132
Nice to meet you.

38:01.134 --> 38:02.634
You see,
for many years,

38:02.636 --> 38:03.968
I had been collecting
the original

38:03.970 --> 38:06.404
<i>Star Trek: T.O.S.</i>
action figures.

38:06.406 --> 38:08.706
And Janice would have
completed my collection.

38:08.708 --> 38:11.276
And, you know, swiped him
in an Internet auction.

38:11.278 --> 38:14.012
I should have been the bigger
man, but, you know, I had

38:14.014 --> 38:15.613
a thing for the actress,
and in this instance,

38:15.615 --> 38:17.415
I kind of felt
Max should have,

38:17.417 --> 38:20.118
you know, stepped aside, but...

38:20.120 --> 38:21.986
It's fine.

38:25.024 --> 38:27.925
You do have a point. I mean...
Ah.

38:27.927 --> 38:29.660
Look, if-if you wanted her back,
No.

38:29.662 --> 38:31.362
I'd understand.
No, no, I insist.

38:31.364 --> 38:32.897
You should have her.

38:32.899 --> 38:34.265
But...

38:34.267 --> 38:36.167
It's meant to be.

38:38.904 --> 38:40.204
You know, um,

38:40.206 --> 38:42.173
this is all very touching,

38:42.175 --> 38:43.808
but, uh, we really have to go.

38:43.810 --> 38:46.444
Dr. Dhawan,
thanks for your help.

38:46.446 --> 38:47.945
We couldn't have
done it without you.

38:47.947 --> 38:50.047
Thank you,
Captain Grover.

38:55.721 --> 38:57.688
I have been,

38:57.690 --> 39:00.391
and always
shall be,

39:00.393 --> 39:02.560
your friend.

39:04.529 --> 39:08.099
Live long and prosper.

39:08.101 --> 39:11.102
Live long and prosper, Max.

39:20.812 --> 39:22.780
(laughing)
(indistinct conversations)

39:24.416 --> 39:26.817
GROVER:
This is awful.

39:26.819 --> 39:29.053
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

39:31.056 --> 39:33.123
Cookies. What are you doing?
Don't make a mess.

39:33.125 --> 39:36.026
Why do you only have one
Christmas album?

39:36.028 --> 39:37.428
I don't know,
it's Andy Williams.

39:37.430 --> 39:38.662
What else do you need?

39:38.664 --> 39:41.298
Wait, hang on, there, chief.
How about Bing Crosby?

39:41.300 --> 39:42.866
How about a little
Nat King Cole?

39:42.868 --> 39:45.335
Hey, Dean Martin's
<i>A Winter Romance</i> is a good one.

39:45.337 --> 39:47.504
I don't have them. I apologize.
If we need additional

39:47.506 --> 39:49.306
musical accompaniment,
I'd be happy to go home

39:49.308 --> 39:51.909
and fetch my keyboard.
I could get my trumpet.

39:51.911 --> 39:54.578
(doorbell rings)
(chuckles)

39:54.580 --> 39:56.813
(Chin laughs)
GROVER (whoops): This'll burn the house down,

39:56.815 --> 39:58.382
you spill this
thing, man.

39:58.384 --> 40:00.684
(hoarse): Where's the tea?
The what?

40:00.686 --> 40:02.386
I need tea and honey.

40:02.388 --> 40:04.454
We been caroling all day.

40:04.456 --> 40:05.822
Pipes are sore, brah.

40:06.658 --> 40:08.392
Kitchen.

<i>Mele Kalikimaka.</i>
OTHERS: <i> Mele Kalikimaka.</i>

40:13.498 --> 40:15.632
What do you think?

40:15.634 --> 40:17.634
Beautiful, right?
I love it.

40:17.636 --> 40:19.870
Good.

40:21.672 --> 40:23.079
What's wrong, Danno?

40:23.103 --> 40:24.108
What's wrong? Nothing's wrong.
What do you mean?

40:24.109 --> 40:26.209
I got everything I want
for Christmas-- I got you,

40:26.211 --> 40:28.211
and I got this
beautiful tree. Come here.

40:28.213 --> 40:30.380

40:33.384 --> 40:35.485
Hey, what's going on?

40:35.487 --> 40:38.154
<i>Mele Kalikimaka,</i>
Detective Williams.

40:39.123 --> 40:41.224
What's this?
A citation.

40:41.226 --> 40:43.860
You and Commander McGarrett
stole a pine tree

40:43.862 --> 40:45.829
from a protected reserve.

40:45.831 --> 40:48.565
I have the evidence to prove it,
and I also have a witness.

40:48.567 --> 40:52.335
What is this, huh? $1,200?

40:52.337 --> 40:54.437
That's the mandatory fine.

40:54.439 --> 40:56.506
And I have to confiscate
the tree.

40:57.908 --> 41:00.643
You're gonna take... Are you serious?
I'm afraid so.

41:00.645 --> 41:03.479
Tonight. It's Christmas Eve.
You're gonna take my tree?

41:04.715 --> 41:06.916

41:06.918 --> 41:08.384

41:08.386 --> 41:10.720

GRACE: Merry Christmas, Pua.

41:10.722 --> 41:13.423
CHIN:
Howzit, Pua?

41:13.425 --> 41:14.824
Well...

41:14.826 --> 41:17.527
You know, maybe I can
take it back tomorrow.

41:18.762 --> 41:21.197
Okay. Come in.
You want an eggnog?

41:21.199 --> 41:22.598
Uh...

41:22.600 --> 41:23.666
Okay? Come on, come on.

41:23.668 --> 41:26.169
Why not? My shift's
almost over.

41:26.171 --> 41:28.004
KAMEKONA: Come on, everybody,
