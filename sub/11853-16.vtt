{\an5}TV NARRATOR:
<i>We now return to</i>
Guppy General Hospital,

18:53.899 --> 18:58.737
<i>where there seems to</i>
<i>be a cold going around.</i>

18:58.804 --> 19:01.740
(Sneezing)

19:01.807 --> 19:03.375
I sure am sick!

19:03.442 --> 19:05.377
Me, too.

19:05.444 --> 19:06.945
(Sneezing)

19:07.012 --> 19:10.182
(Blowing nose)

19:10.249 --> 19:11.483
We need more tissues.

19:11.550 --> 19:13.285
I'll buzz for Dr. Goby.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.053
(Bell chiming)

19:15.120 --> 19:19.558
(Dramatic music playing)

19:19.625 --> 19:22.661
Did somebody buzz for tissues?

19:22.728 --> 19:25.130
You're not Dr. Goby.

19:25.197 --> 19:27.199
No, I'm Dr. Molly.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.268
I'm not sure where Dr. Goby is.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.236
GOBY:
I'm over here.

19:31.303 --> 19:35.674
(Dramatic music playing)

19:35.741 --> 19:36.875
(Sneezing)

19:36.942 --> 19:38.844
I'm sick, too.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.112
Oh, no!

19:40.178 --> 19:41.547
Dr. Goby is sick, too?

19:41.613 --> 19:43.916
{\an5}What are they going to do?

19:41.613 --> 19:43.916
(Sniffling)

19:43.982 --> 19:45.384
If Dr. Goby's sick,

19:45.450 --> 19:48.754
thank goodness Dr. Gil
can take care of us!

19:48.820 --> 19:51.456
(Gil sneezing)

19:51.523 --> 19:55.327
(Dramatic music playing)

19:55.394 --> 20:00.299
{\an5}I'm sick, too.

19:55.394 --> 20:00.299
(Blowing nose)

20:00.365 --> 20:03.001
What about you,
Dr. Molly?

20:03.068 --> 20:05.070
Can you take care of us?

20:05.137 --> 20:07.472
{\an5}Of course I--

20:05.137 --> 20:07.472
(Sneezing)

20:07.539 --> 20:10.742
(Dramatic music playing)

20:10.809 --> 20:14.680
Looks like
I've got it, too.

20:14.746 --> 20:18.884
I'm afraid that everyone
at Guppy General is sick.

20:18.951 --> 20:22.521
But if everyone is sick,
who will take care of us?

20:22.588 --> 20:26.658
(Dramatic music playing)

20:26.725 --> 20:29.394
It's very dramatic!

20:29.461 --> 20:33.432
{\an5}It certainly is!

20:29.461 --> 20:33.432
(Sniffling)

20:33.498 --> 20:37.402
(Dramatic music playing)

20:37.469 --> 20:39.104
Hello.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.840
Dr. Nonny,
thank goodness you're here!

20:41.907 --> 20:44.076
Do you know what's
wrong with us?

20:44.142 --> 20:46.812
I'm afraid you all have...

20:46.878 --> 20:48.480
a cold.

20:48.547 --> 20:51.216
(All gasping)

20:51.283 --> 20:54.953
But Dr. Nonny, how come you
didn't catch the cold?

20:55.020 --> 20:58.123
I was very careful to
wash my hands a lot

20:58.190 --> 20:59.658
to keep the germs away.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.693
That's good hygiene.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.163
But how can we get rid
of the cold, Dr. Nonny?

21:05.230 --> 21:08.433
I'm afraid there's no cure
for the common cold.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.603
(All gasping)

21:11.670 --> 21:14.606
But with a little rest
and lots of stuff to drink,

21:14.673 --> 21:17.976
you should be all better
in just a few days.

21:18.043 --> 21:20.512
I feel better already!

21:20.579 --> 21:24.516
{\an5}TV NARRATOR:

21:24.583 --> 21:28.053

21:28.120 --> 21:29.488
You know, Bubble Puppy,

21:29.554 --> 21:32.024
I feel better already, too.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.426
I just love soap operas.

21:34.493 --> 21:35.927
(Sneezing)

21:35.994 --> 21:37.696
Uh-oh!

21:40.165 --> 21:42.567
I'm glad Mr. Grouper
is feeling better.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.437
Me, too.
It's not fun to be sick.

21:45.504 --> 21:46.938
Oh, hey, look!

21:47.005 --> 21:50.108
I finally figured out how
to give Bubble Puppy a bath.

21:50.175 --> 21:52.811
See? He's already
inside the bucket.

21:52.878 --> 21:56.081
First, I fill
it up with water.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.784
Then I add soap.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.218
And now I scrub.
