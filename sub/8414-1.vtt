00:37.038 --> 00:39.040
You want one with you in it?

00:39.206 --> 00:41.042
Uh, no.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.710
- I'm good.
- Okay.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.568
Bean dip. Ohh.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.154
- I got you good.
- Jesus Christ.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.322
That was such a good one.

01:11.489 --> 01:12.698
Oh, my God.

01:12.865 --> 01:15.076
- Ow.
- My God.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.952
- Give me a minute.
- How was your flight?

01:17.119 --> 01:19.705
It was fine. Come here.
How was yours?

01:19.872 --> 01:21.290
- It was good.
- Good to see you.

01:21.457 --> 01:22.583
It was good.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.293
- Let's get your bag.
- Thanks.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.961
Glad you made an effort.
What are you wearing?

01:26.128 --> 01:27.380
I didn't know we were going
to a Bar Mitzvah.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.423
It's a Bat Mitzvah.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.219
Um, I'm actually, like...

01:34.386 --> 01:36.555
I'm, like, a few hundred miles
away right now.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.809
I jumped on a flight this morning
and I'm gonna be gone for the day.

01:39.975 --> 01:43.479
But I'll be back tomorrow,
so don't worry about it.

01:43.646 --> 01:44.688
God, dude.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.942
28 shows in 30 days.
Have I missed one?

01:49.777 --> 01:51.278
Have I missed one?

01:51.445 --> 01:53.072
No, no. I'm not burned out.

01:53.239 --> 01:55.616
I just have to... I just needed
to come home for a sec.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.625
So this is the high school, huh?

02:04.792 --> 02:07.086
It looks like a mental ward.

02:07.253 --> 02:09.505
Hey, do you really...
do you like this car?

02:09.672 --> 02:11.799
Yeah, I like the car.
Why?

02:11.966 --> 02:13.968
I don't know. It's just... that didn't
sound very convincing.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.595
- No, baby, I like the...
- 'Cause I loved my other car.

02:17.596 --> 02:18.984
- What are you looking for?
- Do you have any gum?

02:19.140 --> 02:20.228
- Wait... wait a minute. I got...
- Oh.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.017
- What do you... gum? It's right here.
- Yeah.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.395
Oh, okay.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.566
Thanks for coming with me.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.067
Well, I'm excited
to meet everybody.

02:30.234 --> 02:32.695
Finally get some dirt on you.

02:32.862 --> 02:35.406
- You want some?
- No. I really don't want that.

02:35.573 --> 02:37.825
- Have it. Have it.
- That's really gross.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.662
Boarding all rows for ï¬‚ight...

02:41.829 --> 02:43.873
Hey, where... where's Emily?

02:44.039 --> 02:45.791
She had to work at the hospital
this weekend. She can't come.

02:45.958 --> 02:48.711
What?
That frickin' sucks.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.337
What, are you gonna cry about it?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.839
I'm disappointed.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.300
I'm not disappointed.
It's the two of us. It's gonna be great.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.010
- No, I know...
- It's like old times.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.678
Just you and me, ese.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.764
Okay, "pawl"

03:01.765 --> 03:04.310
Okay, "Cholo." What, are you cultivating
a new reunion personality?

03:04.476 --> 03:06.270
People say "ese."
People say ese all the time.

03:06.437 --> 03:07.980
Okay.
Yes, Jason.

03:08.147 --> 03:10.649
Listen, man.
I gotta... I gotta go.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.276
- Oh, we just passed it...

03:12.443 --> 03:13.819
Aw...!

03:21.535 --> 03:24.038
- Oh! Oh, my God.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.709
- What's up, man?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.294
Damn, you got fat, sucker.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.046
I got fat? What, did you eat
one of your kids?

03:32.213 --> 03:33.964
- I'm sexy. Hi, honey.
- What... hi.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.341
- How you doing?
- Good to see you again.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.426
- Welcome home. Come in.
- Sure.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.595
You guys.

03:42.431 --> 03:43.432
Hey, look who's here.

03:43.599 --> 03:44.642
- Hi!
- Hi!

03:44.808 --> 03:46.227
Samantha.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.895
It's so good to see you again.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.314
- Oh, so good to see...

03:50.481 --> 03:52.316
That is a cute sweater vest.

03:52.483 --> 03:53.980
- They're in matching sweaters.
- Just like his daddy.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.528
- They're in matching sweaters.
- What up, Sammy?

03:56.695 --> 03:58.697
I'm so happy to see you.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.324
Too bad you didn't come
with a shotgun.

04:00.491 --> 04:02.243
- I'm so happy you guys are here.
- I'd blow my brains out.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.495
Come on. All right, all right.
Enough about the kid.

04:04.662 --> 04:07.748
- Come check this out.
- Go say hi...

04:07.915 --> 04:10.125
- Hi, darling.
- Lilly, say hi to Aunt Jess.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.293
Yeah, that's the other one.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.461
It's cool.
You don't have to...

04:12.628 --> 04:13.629
- Lilly, baby.
- It's all right.

04:13.796 --> 04:15.756
She don't care, you don't care.
She's not gonna remember.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.257
- Okay.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.426
Okay, okay. Shh.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.220
There he is.

04:21.387 --> 04:22.596
- Is that you, buddy?
- Jake? Oh.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.556
- Man, how are you? Good?
- Long time no see.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.016
- Hi, I'm Jess.
- Scott.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.643
Scott?
Nice to meet you.

04:27.810 --> 04:29.812
- Suki.
- Suki, nice to meet you. Oh...

04:29.979 --> 04:32.231
- you're the one that lives in Japan.
- Yes.

04:32.398 --> 04:33.691
No.
Not from me, man.

04:33.857 --> 04:36.151
I see you every day.
I got you on Google Alert.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.695
- Oh, yeah?
- Is that weird?

04:37.861 --> 04:39.571
- That's totally weird, dude.
- Is it weird?

04:39.738 --> 04:41.207
Naw, it's not weird.
My mom's got me on Google Alert.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.450
Oh, my God. We've been trying
to get out there for so long.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.286
It just... I don't know,
hasn't happened.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.787
Aw, don't worry about it.
You got time.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.122
- You got time. I'm not going anywhere.
- Is it amazing?

04:48.289 --> 04:51.166
Don't worry about it.
I don't come back, either,

04:51.333 --> 04:53.752
and I live in driving distance.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.546
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.339
Wait a minute.
Is that who I think it is out there?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.759
Oh, my God.
Look who it is.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.845
- Aw, Jacob.
- What is going on?

05:03.012 --> 05:04.388
- Hey, look who's here. Look who's here.
- You're in trouble right here.

05:04.555 --> 05:07.224
Dude, things must be going great, man.
You look fantastic.

05:07.391 --> 05:11.395
Um, can I say I can't complain
without sounding like I'm bragging?

05:11.562 --> 05:12.650
- 'Cause I can't complain.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.273
How long did it take
you guys to drive in?

05:14.440 --> 05:16.650
Oh, about an hour, hour and a half.
There was a little bit of traffic.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.277
Hour and a half.
That's not nearly enough.

05:18.444 --> 05:19.737
You gotta get away
from here, Jake.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.780
You gotta run away
and not look back.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.907
You're better than that
is what I'm trying to say.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.868
Cully, really?
What is in here?

05:26.035 --> 05:28.537
- Nut up, bro.
- This is straight vodka.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.414
No, there's a little bit
of soda in it.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.374
You're gonna have so much fun
at Grandma and Grandpa's.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.584
Yes, you are.

05:33.751 --> 05:35.544
Mommy's gonna have
a night without you.

05:35.711 --> 05:39.089
She loves you, but she needs to be
with some adults, doesn't she?

05:39.256 --> 05:41.342
Hey, hey, guys.
We got an idea.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.344
Is there any way we can sneak
some of this booze in?

05:44.345 --> 05:45.846
Isn't there...
there's an open bar, right?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.806
I know that.
It's the principle of the thing.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.600
Yeah, we did it in high school
for like, every event.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.560
Why would we not do it now?
'Cause we're too "mature"?

05:51.727 --> 05:53.228
- We're adults?
- Exactly.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.855
Hey, do you have any flasks?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.899
'Cause I feel like we're each
gonna need one.

05:57.066 --> 06:00.194
I can't find anything with a lid.
How you doing?

06:00.361 --> 06:02.363
- Nothing.
- I'm sorry, you guys.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.491
I got two kids and a wife who
doesn't let me drink in public any more.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.034
- Shocking.
- I made an exception for tonight,

06:07.201 --> 06:08.744
which I'm beginning to think
was a mistake.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.705
I found this, but I need something small
enough to fit down my pants comfortably.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.290
Are you touching yourself
in front of my children?

06:13.457 --> 06:14.958
I'm not doing it sexually.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.877
What's your kid got over there?

06:22.257 --> 06:23.592
- Could we get a ride?
- It's good.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.594
My mom dropped us off.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.763
Wow, so ninth grade of you.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.224
I actually haven't driven a car
since I moved to Tokyo.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.475
Yeah, I don't own a car.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.185
That's what happens
when you live in an actual city.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.562
I live in New York City, Snooki.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.065
- Great. Then you can drive.
- How does that make sense?

06:38.232 --> 06:40.275
Hey, no, no, no, no.
Don't leave.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.736
- God damn it.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.196
I thought we were
gonna go together.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.907
Sam and I just gotta drop
the kids off with her mom.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.992
It's only gonna be a minute.
They live like, two miles away.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.911
Mom.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.747
She's coming. Mommy's coming.
You're a big boy.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.707
Hey, listen. You don't
have to pretend to like my kids.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.835
So cute. No, man.
It's completely genuine.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.754
- Come on, Bubba. I know.
- He's awesome.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.215
I'm not saying I don't think
they're cool. They're super cool.

07:03.382 --> 07:06.510
I love the shit out of 'em.
But it doesn't mean you have to.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.847
You know what I mean?
So, where'd you park?

07:10.013 --> 07:11.932
Uh, I took a cab.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.107
Can we turn this off,
please, honey?

07:20.274 --> 07:21.525
Did you not
put the night light in here?

07:21.692 --> 07:23.152
Pfft, Pfft. pfft.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.679
- Please turn this off.
- Shoot.

07:24.695 --> 07:28.031
My mother still doesn't have one.
Reeves, I think we have your CD in here.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.535
- I know he listens to it all the time.
- God, no. Please, no.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.579
Bro, we're listening to your CD.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.581
Pfft, oh!

07:35.747 --> 07:37.040
I'm playing it right now.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.750
- No, please don't.
- Come on, man.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.170
- Don't. No, no, no, no, no.
- I wanna listen to it with you.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.088
I don't wanna hear that shit.
Come on.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.507
You're gonna cause a commotion
at this thing tonight.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.509
- You know that?
- Yeah.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.804
Uh, I wasn't gonna come, man.
I had no intention of coming.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.806
- I just...

07:52.973 --> 07:54.349
you know, I got the itch.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.477
Yeah, dude.
I know exactly what you mean.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.271
I actually got a lot of work
to do tonight.

07:59.438 --> 08:00.898
Work to do?

08:01.064 --> 08:02.649
Yeah, I don't know how well
you remember this,

08:02.816 --> 08:06.111
but apparently I guess I was kind of
an asshole in high school.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.905
"Kind of an asshole," honey?

08:08.071 --> 08:11.742
I loved you guys,
but kinda hated you, didn't I?

08:11.909 --> 08:13.243
- Got the night light?
- Yes.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.163
- Awesome.
- I... aw, I forgot his poo-poo.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.499
God damn it.
Honey, we gotta go.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.750
His "poo-poo"?

08:19.917 --> 08:23.086
Oh, it's his blankie.
Yeah.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.379
You gonna get
your poo-poo, buddy?

08:24.546 --> 08:26.590
- Oh.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.259
- That's hilarious.
- Yeah.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.787
This is gonna be good.
It's gonna be good.

08:30.802 --> 08:34.847
I'm gonna apologize to some people
tonight and I'm gonna mean it.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.767
So who you going for tonight?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.018
What do you mean?

08:38.184 --> 08:39.520
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

08:39.686 --> 08:42.940
You're like, a single, handsome,
interesting, funny guy.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.193
You'd be the belle
of the ball tonight.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.798
You can choose anybody you want.
Who you gonna go for?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.111
You sound a little jealous
up there, brother.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.029
- Yeah, right?
- I am jealous.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.198
I am... for once, I'm actually jealous
of this asshole.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.784
Oh, yeah. It must be such a burden
having to go home

08:53.951 --> 08:56.203
to your awesome doctor wife
every night. I'm so sorry, AJ.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.205
- Marty...
- Well-paying job,

08:58.372 --> 08:59.581
- your four-bedroom house.
- Marty...

08:59.748 --> 09:01.375
- What a nightmare.
- Answer the question.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.377
- Answer the question.
- I don't know.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.170
- Oh, come on.
- I haven't given it much thought.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.256
- Come on... I'm a married man.
- Exactly.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.674
I've been having sex with my eyes closed
for the last three years.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.760
I gotta live vicariously through you.
It's a hypothetical question.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.696
If you could hook up with any girl
you went to high school with,

09:13.804 --> 09:16.515
- who would you choose?
- I don't know. Anna, probably.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.183
- Anna? Anna?
- Maybe, I don't know if she's single.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.269
- She's probably not single.
- That's a great choice.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.563
That is a great choice.
That is a very good choice.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.357
No, no, no.
It's a good choice.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.296
What are you saying back there?

09:32.906 --> 09:35.075
I just prefer Ralph Macchio.
I don't know why that's a bad thing.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.203
$20 says he says something
about beating me.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.455
Well, your little Volvo

09:40.622 --> 09:42.708
did not pass the American test.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.002
Rental car, too.
Didn't even try.

09:45.168 --> 09:48.088
- I'm not even-I'm not doing it.
- All right, Mario Andretti.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.466
- I'm not doing it.
- He'll never stop giving you shit, man.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.427
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too, man.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.178
It's good to see everybody, man.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.598
God, everyone came back.
Is Mary coming?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.558
Uh, no, I don't think so.

09:59.725 --> 10:02.477
I think Sam said she got an e-mail from
her saying she wasn't gonna make it.

10:02.644 --> 10:05.230
Oh, well.

10:05.397 --> 10:08.233
What if she did make it?
Would you still have brought Jess?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.736
- Yeah. Why...
- You sure?

10:10.902 --> 10:11.903
Why wouldn't I?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.781
- Don't... don't give me that.
- It's a fair question, bro.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.783
One, two, three.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.251
- Look at this place.
- Complimentary photo?

10:26.418 --> 10:27.544
- Yes.
- Uh...

10:27.711 --> 10:29.921
- Right over here, guys.
- Yeah, you boys go ahead.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.965
No, no, no.
It's your school. Go ahead.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.718
All right, let's do it.
Just the guys.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.345
Why are you so excited
for this photograph?

10:36.511 --> 10:37.763
Right here, guys.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.307
Three, two, one.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.477
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome. Good to see you.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.729
Come over here.
The name tags are right over here.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.856
So glad you guys made it.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.400
Everybody's upstairs for a drink, so
after you get a name tag, go up there...

10:50.567 --> 10:52.986
- Dude.
- Yeah, hi! Nice to see you.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.822
- Grab a drink upstairs, okay?
- Oh, you mean... what do you want?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.699
Okay.
She's busy.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.077
I get the night off of name duty.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.244
What's... what is that?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.330
I panic every time I go
to introduce her to somebody.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.624
- I forget their name.
- So I introduce myself.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.334
I'm like,
"Hi, I'm Jess. You are?"

11:07.501 --> 11:09.544
Yeah, so the two of you guys
have it all figured out. I love that.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.713
She's got it all figured out.
She just takes care of me.

11:11.880 --> 11:12.881
We're gonna get drinks.
We'll see you in there.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.049
- Okay.
- I'm so going.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.467
I can't stop looking
at her boobs.

11:17.552 --> 11:20.847
Okay, so whatever you need tonight,
I am your wingman.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.516
- Oh, you're gonna be my wingman?
- Yeah.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.017
Please don't do that.
You're the worst...

11:24.184 --> 11:25.327
I love you, but you're
the worst wingman.

11:25.477 --> 11:26.838
What are you talking about?
I'm the best wingman.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.146
Yeah, you really hooked it up
with Julie.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.354
- I'm the best wingman in the world.
- See, the worst wingman in the world

11:30.399 --> 11:31.483
always says they're the best
wingman in the world.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.193
- But I'm the best, though.
- Yeah, that's my point.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.321
- So you ready for this?
- We'll see.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.198
How about some shots?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.491
I love you.

11:39.658 --> 11:43.370
Dude, that wasn't on purpose.
That wasn't part of the game.

11:43.537 --> 11:44.705
Okay, how was I supposed
to know she was pregnant?

11:44.871 --> 11:45.872
How were you supposed to know
she was pregnant?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.166
Second of all, I'm the one
who came off badly

11:48.333 --> 11:50.238
- and you came off really well.
- Yeah, but you just came off, like...

11:50.252 --> 11:51.378
That was good wingmanship.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.005
No, I came off like I have racist,
weird friends who say things like,

11:54.172 --> 11:55.507
"Of course you're pregnant.
You're a Latina."

11:55.674 --> 11:56.758
You're not your friends, though.
You're not your friends.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.135
Wait, wait.
Stay in the shadows.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.470
I'm so glad you're here.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.055
- Yo, what's up?
- Oh.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.015
Went ahead and made
your name tag for you.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.892
- Ooh, okay.
- Let's stick it.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.061
Maybe.
Okay, yeah.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.730
- Be...

12:09.896 --> 12:11.898
...serious. That was-
sorry, that one wasn't good.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.401
- Can we do it again, please?
- Welcome, welcome. Come in.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.611
Look at Reeves.
It's happening already.

12:16.778 --> 12:20.073
- Could I get some singles, please?
- Everybody grab a name tag.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.242
Hey, Reeves, man.
I gotta borrow you for just one second.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.578
- Okay? He'll be right back.
- Oh.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.580
No, he won't.
Don't follow him.

12:34.045 --> 12:37.132
Can we get two shots of tequila
and two Stellas, please?

12:37.299 --> 12:39.009
Jake?

12:39.176 --> 12:41.094
- Hey, man.
- Oh, my God.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.054
- How you doing?
- Good. What's going on, man?

12:43.221 --> 12:45.724
- This is Jess.
- Hi, this is my wife Olivia.

12:45.891 --> 12:47.350
- Hi.
- Hi, How are you doing?

12:47.517 --> 12:48.769
- Jake, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.896
Can you believe this?

12:55.233 --> 12:56.943
What are you doing?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.612
- Garrity?
- Cully.

12:58.779 --> 13:02.616
Dude. Oh, my God, look at you.
You look all normal and shit.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.285
You look like a frickin'
J.Crew ad over here.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.620
Look at this guy.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.371
You got, like,
a Jude Law thing happening.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.166
You do.
You look just like Jude Law.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.335
- As opposed to what?
- Yeah.

13:13.502 --> 13:14.878
Who did you used to look like?

13:19.674 --> 13:20.675
What's your name again?

13:20.842 --> 13:24.012
- Uh, Peter.
- Peter.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.806
I was a dick to you
back in high school, wasn't I?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.308
- What are you...
- Let me buy his drink.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.853
- No, it's... it's an open bar.
- Is it? Double vodka, no mixers.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.188
Here, take your tip back.

13:33.355 --> 13:34.606
- I'll leave a tip for you.
- I-i-it's fine.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.615
Uh, complimentary photo?

13:43.782 --> 13:46.243
Oh, sure.

13:50.705 --> 13:51.998
You want anybody in it with you?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.333
Oh, no. It's okay.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.837
I can't believe they chose this hotel.
It's perfect.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.216
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.969
- Oh. my God!

14:05.262 --> 14:07.556
- You look amazing!
- Look how skinny you are!

14:11.768 --> 14:13.478
Hi, can I get my picture taken
with you too?

14:13.645 --> 14:15.522
- Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Thank you so much.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.650
Ahem.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.278
- Gorgeous. Let's take a photo.
- Come here. Come on.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.197
Do you mind if we do it again?
I think I blinked.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.826
Yeah, I think I did, too.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.911
Let's get this jag poppin'.

14:30.078 --> 14:32.289
Oh, G-Money.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.750
Get low, baby.
Come on, get in here.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.753
Wha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, oh!

14:39.754 --> 14:41.339
- What's up, man?
- This is Andre.

14:41.506 --> 14:42.948
- This is one of my oldest friends.
- How you doing?

14:42.966 --> 14:45.719
- Hi.
- This is my wife Olivia.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.722
- Hi.
- This is your wife?

14:48.889 --> 14:50.515
Yeah, we're... we're married.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.225
You married
a white girl, for real?

14:52.392 --> 14:53.852
You...

14:54.019 --> 14:56.104
Wow.
That's crazy.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.064
- He's, uh...
- Yeah.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.572
This is so amazing.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.575
Well, it should be. I've been looking
forward to this for a very long time.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.870
- So have I.
- Oh.

15:12.037 --> 15:14.539
- Mortgage broker, huh?
- Mortgage-yes.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.334
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sure you're awesome at it.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.543
- I just...
- Really?

15:18.710 --> 15:20.795
I didn't see it coming.
I'm not gonna lie. I...

15:20.962 --> 15:22.714
- I feel good about that now.
- Watch it, man.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.174
What is this?
What's that?

15:24.341 --> 15:26.343
Oh, this is, uh-this is Julie's.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.261
Yeah.
You stole it from her?

15:28.428 --> 15:29.679
I just thought it'd be more fun

15:29.846 --> 15:32.140
if I just filmed all of us
getting wasted tonight.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.601
- Done. More shots?
- That'd be really funny.

15:34.768 --> 15:35.769
- Yes.
- Done.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.521
They're not all for me.
They're for everybody.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.106
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.610
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. How are you?

15:43.777 --> 15:46.321
- So good.
- Now the party can start.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.198
You heard it, everybody.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.116
Now the party can start.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.956
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

15:59.626 --> 16:01.836
I miss you so much, Cully.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.965
I can't do this.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.510
I just thought you were
really into rap music.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.804
Yeah, well, I was.
I still am.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.306
No, I know.
But I thought that meant

16:13.473 --> 16:15.600
you liked Coolio and stuff.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.519
I didn't know that meant
you thought you were black.

16:17.686 --> 16:20.105
So, you guys
come with boyfriends

16:20.271 --> 16:22.524
or you married or...

16:22.691 --> 16:24.150
I'm married.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.860
Who... who'd you marry?

16:26.861 --> 16:28.238
Oh, you've seen the commercials?

16:30.699 --> 16:32.617
You married Cully?

16:32.784 --> 16:34.828
Dude, dude, look.
There she is.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.037
There's Anna.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.706
God, she looks good,
doesn't she?

16:37.872 --> 16:39.165
Yeah, she looks really glamorous.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.334
Let me help you with that.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.128
Is she gonna...

16:44.170 --> 16:46.506
- We'll... we'll work up to it.
- Yeah, okay.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.676
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

16:49.843 --> 16:50.844
- Okay.
- Where's she going?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.137
I'll be right back.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.388
She probably won't come back.
I think you scared her off.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.849
Good job.
You scared her off.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.142
She might not come back.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.768
So, is this
getting serious or what?

16:58.935 --> 17:00.353
Yeah, of course it's getting serious.
We've been together for, like,

17:00.520 --> 17:01.896
three and a half years.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.189
So, it's serious?

17:03.356 --> 17:04.983
I would say it's serious, yes.

17:05.150 --> 17:08.069
How black, uh...
did you act?

17:08.236 --> 17:11.031
Did I act? Like on a scale
from one to 10?

17:11.196 --> 17:13.407
Like on a scale
from white to black?

17:13.575 --> 17:15.868
I'd say, like, a...

17:16.036 --> 17:17.829
a dark gray.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.165
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing with my camera?

17:20.330 --> 17:23.542
Okay, hi, yeah. No, we need
to put the camera back right now.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.627
- Vanillo, I'm serious. Just...
- But I'm gonna get everybody.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.547
Yeah, right,
you will get everybody.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.923
- Just put it back. It's just perfect.
- I'm gonna put it back.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.383
- I set up perfectly.
- I'll put it back.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.760
- Okay, thank you.
- After I do this.

17:31.926 --> 17:32.927
No, Vanillo!

17:33.094 --> 17:34.721
I got a baby girl.
You wanna see a picture?

17:34.888 --> 17:36.890
Yeah, I do.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.892
She's a beauty.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.226
- She is beautiful.
- There she is.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.520
Wait a minute.
You don't have any babies.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.065
- A boat? You have a boat?
- Yeah, I told you about the boat.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.232
- Do you have any...
- You didn't tell me...

17:46.399 --> 17:48.234
- I don't have any boats, no.
- Kids.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.489
Does he have any kids?
Look at the guy.

17:49.652 --> 17:50.737
He's like the king
of New York City.

17:50.904 --> 17:53.948
He's out dining on Wall Street,
sleeping with models and stuff.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.159
- Tell her. Tell her about the models.
- Uh...

17:56.326 --> 17:58.661
Being genuine is not something

17:58.828 --> 18:02.540
that comes easily for me
as far as an emotion.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.919
I want to make sure
that my "genuinity"

18:06.086 --> 18:08.546
is expressing itself
clearly to you.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.632
Sure.
And it's so good to see you.

18:10.799 --> 18:11.883
So good to see you.

18:12.050 --> 18:15.011
It's been... I'm gonna come
by the dealership.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.013
- Good to see you, Peter.
- I just-my friends are...

18:17.180 --> 18:18.348
Oh, jackpot.
Look at that table.

18:18.515 --> 18:22.227
No, no, no, no, no.
Come back. Come back.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.854
Let them do their thing.
Let them talk.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.023
Look at them.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.944
Oh, I have so much work to do
to that table.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.613
I know. I know you do.
Just don't be too aggressive, you know?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.949
'Cause then it gets
a little assholey.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.243
Well, nice catching up
with you, Elise.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.287
Oh, my God.
This is what I mean.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.956
This is why you're
the worst wingman in the world.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.291
Oh, come on, man.
I was trying to create demand.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.043
- What?
- It's called salesmanship.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.878
- What?
- If she knows that you've been

18:49.045 --> 18:50.630
with other high-quality women,
she's gonna be like,

18:50.797 --> 18:53.258
"Oh, maybe I can be
one of those high-quality women."

18:53.424 --> 18:54.634
Do you really believe
what you're saying?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.136
- Makes a lot of sense.
- That makes sense, not what you did.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.721
You showed her photos of your
goddamn boat. Who does that?

18:58.888 --> 19:00.473
She was asking
to see baby pictures. I was...

19:00.640 --> 19:02.725
Yeah, which is when
normal people say, "Oh, I'm so sorry.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.978
I don't have any babies
with my wife yet to take pictures of."

19:05.145 --> 19:06.479
It's a conversation killer.
It's a conversation killer.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.106
No, no, no.
You wearing a captain's hat

19:08.273 --> 19:09.649
standing next
to a little grounded boat...

19:09.816 --> 19:11.526
that's a real conversation killer.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.952
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

19:21.119 --> 19:22.787
- What are you doing?
- You left me out there for, like,

19:22.954 --> 19:24.873
I don't even know how long,
all by myself.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.124
I've been in here two minutes.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.626
- Yeah, two minutes is too long.
- Stop.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.045
All your friends are out there.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.840
I don't care about them.
I <i>care</i> about being with you.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.508
Aw.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.553
But Cully did ask

19:38.720 --> 19:42.640
if I could go out to the car
with him and Dre.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.517
That's what this is about.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.561
Go ahead.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.479
- I can go?
- Yeah.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.023
- You wanna come?
- No.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.524
I'm gonna hang out with Sam.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.610
- No, just come on...
- But you can't have more than two puffs

19:53.776 --> 19:55.528
because you're
a lightweight, remember?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.071
- Oh, is that what I am?
- Don't.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.324
- Really?
- Yes, don't you remember?

20:06.539 --> 20:07.874
Why are you looking at me?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.420
I love looking at you.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.675
Could look at you forever.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.969
That's sweet.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.266
You need to go.
I love you.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.268
- Nobody in here.
- No, baby.

20:27.435 --> 20:30.146
Someone's gonna come in here.
Someone's gonna come in.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.481
I love you, leave.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.441
I gotta do my makeup.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.444
One puff, lightweight.
Don't forget.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.159
Dre, you're a lifesaver
with this stuff.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.578
No, I got glaucoma, dude.
So I got a cause.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.748
I can't handle any more
two-minute conversations, man.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.959
At least you only got a two-minute
conversation from Todd.

20:51.125 --> 20:54.420
I got a 20-minute conversation
from his wife, Lauren.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.192
Well, at least you're talking
about something interesting.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.258
I gotta talk about mortgages

20:58.424 --> 21:01.010
and default loans
and all this bullshit.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.554
I still can't believe
that he's a mortgage broker.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.604
You'd have had
a job like this, too,

21:05.765 --> 21:07.225
if you weren't so damn
good at something.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.769
You know what I'm good at?
Two-minute conversations.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.938
- I'm the king of them.
- Then tell me how to get out of them.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.565
You just got to tell them
you gotta go to the bathroom, dude.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.110
I've gone to the bathroom
like, 12 times today.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.279
I'm sure Sam
really appreciates that.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.780
She's a big girl.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.116
- Kinda.
- Are you saying she's a big girl?

21:23.283 --> 21:25.451
- She was in high school.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.788
Oh, Sam. I don't know how
she deals with you sometimes, man.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.623
- I love you, though.
- You know what, dude?

21:30.790 --> 21:33.751
You just... none of you guys
know shit.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.003
You're not married.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.463
You know what?
Marry Jess. Then we'll talk.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.133
Are you... you want me to marry Jess?
Is that what you're saying?

21:40.300 --> 21:42.218
Yeah, marry Jess, dude.
You'll know my pain then.

21:42.385 --> 21:43.469
Don't do it.
Don't do this.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.514
It's okay. All right.
Open the glove box.

21:48.099 --> 21:50.351
Grab that envelope right there.

21:52.312 --> 21:54.188
Hey, Cully.
Look at this.

21:54.355 --> 21:55.565
What is it?

21:57.233 --> 22:00.278
Oh, shit.

22:00.445 --> 22:01.863
- What?
- Yep.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.031
- Wow.
- Whoa.

22:03.197 --> 22:05.283
- When'd you get that?
- Bought it like, eight months ago.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.036
You bought it eight months ago
and you never told me about it?

22:08.202 --> 22:11.539
No, well, I'm gonna tell you.
I gotta tell her first.

22:11.706 --> 22:12.790
But, yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.626
It just hasn't quite been...
just hasn't been quite right.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.420
You'd leave it in an envelope?

22:19.172 --> 22:20.631
Yeah, it's better than a ring box.

22:20.798 --> 22:24.427
And, like, so she can find it and say,
"I wonder what's in the ring box."

22:24.594 --> 22:26.471
- Well, why haven't you given it to her?
- Boom.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.016
I tri... I mean, I've planned
a few things

22:30.183 --> 22:31.601
and they just weren't exactly right.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.020
Women don't care
how you ask them.

22:34.187 --> 22:37.065
All they care is that you're stupid
enough to ask them.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.941
All they want is the ring.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.361
I know people, man.
That's what I do.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.738
I don't sing,
I don't sell cars,

22:43.905 --> 22:46.366
I don't do what you do.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.452
That's how I eat.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.287
- It's why you eat?
- That's how I eat.

22:51.454 --> 22:52.747
What does that mean?

22:52.914 --> 22:55.875
I don't think you know people
as good as you think you know people.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.168
It's what I do, all right?

22:57.335 --> 22:59.879
Just... it sounds like you put a lot of
pressure on yourself, too,

23:00.046 --> 23:03.091
to make it super perfect. I mean, you
gotta be open to spontaneity, too, man.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.301
I mean, if you're ready to do it,
just pull the trigger, you know?

23:05.468 --> 23:08.388
I mean, you've built
a real solid foundation.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.723
You've got the job,
you got the nice car...

23:10.890 --> 23:12.600
- I don't know about the car.
- Yeah, dude.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.477
I think it's a very adult car.

23:14.644 --> 23:16.521
- I think it's very nice.
- I do, too.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.731
I think it sucks, dude.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.531
- That's good.
- Trick Daddy had a Volvo, man.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.402
- These are nice cars.
- I put him in this Volvo.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.173
- They're very safe.
- They're very safe.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.989
That's a good point.
That is a good point, Reeves.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.408
The back seat is nice.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.152
- You don't drive a Volvo.
- This is nice. My grandmother

23:30.284 --> 23:32.787
- would be proud of it.
- If Ford owns Volvo, it's a good car.

23:32.954 --> 23:35.081
"Consumer Reports" number one
every single year.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.416
I'm fried, dude.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.043
- Look who it is.
- Oh, holy shit.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.254
- I thought she wasn't coming.
- Oh, shit.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.298
Yo, who is that she's with?

23:44.465 --> 23:46.384
When's the last time
you spoke to her?

23:47.385 --> 23:49.220
Like eight years ago.

23:49.387 --> 23:50.972
Did you tell Jess about her?

23:51.139 --> 23:53.724
Yeah, of course
I told Jess about her.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.476
Oh, this is gonna get weird.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.311
Yep.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.367
How we doing here?
Did you get enough to eat?

24:11.534 --> 24:13.619
If I wanted to be in a boy band,
I woulda been in a boy band.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.121
I woulda started my own.

24:15.288 --> 24:16.873
We would've been
bigger than NSync.

24:17.039 --> 24:20.376
It looked like she waved at you.
Was she like, one of your... shorties?

24:20.543 --> 24:23.004
You're in real estate,
I'm in real estate.

24:23.171 --> 24:24.172
- What?
- What?

24:27.133 --> 24:28.676
Fingerlings.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.761
Fingerlingin' good.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.307
Finger lickin' good.
Joke.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.018
Do you mind if I sit here?

24:37.185 --> 24:39.937
Oh, hey.
Hey.

24:40.104 --> 24:41.606
- Hey.
- How's it going?

24:41.772 --> 24:43.232
- Good.
- Did you see Marty yet?

24:43.399 --> 24:44.525
- He's...
- I haven't. Is he here?

24:44.692 --> 24:45.753
He's somewhere.
He's around somewhere.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.487
- He was looking for you.
- Oh, wow.

24:52.867 --> 24:55.036
Hi!

24:55.203 --> 24:56.704
Julie.
Be prepared.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.206
Julie. Okay.

24:58.372 --> 25:02.001
- My gosh, Mary.
- Hi.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.295
- I am so glad you guys made it.
- Okay.

25:04.462 --> 25:06.214
Good luck, okay?
Ow!

25:06.380 --> 25:08.674
You got some nuts on you.

25:09.967 --> 25:11.719
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:11.886 --> 25:13.054
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:13.221 --> 25:15.264
I am... I know we took a long time
and I apologize.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.225
- It's okay.
- It was Cully.

25:17.391 --> 25:18.559
He had to go
to the bathroom really bad.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.853
Baby, it's fine.
I've just been over there

25:21.020 --> 25:23.689
talking to Sam, who is really,
really, really cool.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.441
- Like, I love her.
- I know. Tim's...

25:25.608 --> 25:27.693
Love her. And then this
really weird guy came up

25:27.860 --> 25:30.029
who was like, tall, he's skinny,
he's really annoying,

25:30.196 --> 25:32.823
with like, crazy weird hair.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.159
- Was he touching you at all?
- No.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.536
- You sure?
- No, he wasn't.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.412
But he was driving me crazy.

25:40.248 --> 25:41.749
Oh, shit. Uh...

25:41.916 --> 25:43.042
- Hi.
- How are you?

25:43.209 --> 25:45.211
- Hi... I'm sorry, that was...
- Sorry. Yeah, no. Of course.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.712
I apologize. I went right in.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.548
- No. Hi.
- I... I...

25:48.714 --> 25:50.007
Hi... hey.

25:50.174 --> 25:51.175
- Hi, I'm Jess. Hi.
- This is Jess.

25:51.342 --> 25:52.885
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.512
Nice to meet you, too.
Mary, sorry.

25:54.679 --> 25:56.931
- Oh, okay. Of course.
- Paul.

25:57.098 --> 25:59.058
- Paul?
- The husband.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.228
- Uh, this is Jess.
- I'm Jess.

26:02.395 --> 26:03.729
Are you a classmate as well?

26:03.896 --> 26:06.023
No, no. I'm his girlfriend.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.693
I'm just here, supporting,
having fun.

26:08.859 --> 26:11.612
Jake, that's
a pretty cool name.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.114
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.407
- I like that name.
- All right.

26:14.574 --> 26:15.658
Ah, four-letter word.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.285
- Aren't you glad we came?
- I am glad.

26:17.451 --> 26:20.705
I mean, I was really worried that...
but you've seen so many people...

26:22.873 --> 26:25.543
Hi, sorry.
Is this... is this seat taken?

26:25.710 --> 26:28.129
- No.
- No? Okay.

26:28.296 --> 26:30.298
I'm just gonna join you guys.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.552
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.680
That's for you.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.600
What's this for?

26:40.766 --> 26:42.727
I owe you three bucks.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.688
- You do?
- Yeah.

26:45.855 --> 26:48.149
Mr. Ferguson's physics class.

26:48.316 --> 26:50.651
Junior year we went to the planetarium,
you remember?

26:50.818 --> 26:53.279
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.906
I don't remember anything, really,

26:56.073 --> 26:57.658
about junior year, though, so...

26:57.825 --> 27:00.661
Oh, well, you let me borrow some money,
so I thought I'd pay you back.

27:00.828 --> 27:02.913
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.666
- It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.501
It's nice to see you.

27:07.668 --> 27:08.919
Thanks.

27:09.086 --> 27:11.631
You're actually the reason
that I switched to the tuba.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.549
Really?

27:13.716 --> 27:16.636
Um... I'm honored?

27:16.802 --> 27:18.429
You shouldn't be.

27:18.596 --> 27:21.766
I switched to the tuba because
it was too big to take home from school

27:21.932 --> 27:24.310
so I didn't have to carry it
on the bus to and from school,

27:24.477 --> 27:26.520
which meant that I didn't have
an instrument at the bus stop,

27:26.687 --> 27:28.147
which meant that
you forgot that I was in band,

27:28.314 --> 27:30.399
which meant that
you finally left me alone.

27:31.692 --> 27:34.153
I owe you...

27:34.320 --> 27:38.532
and you, and you, and you,

27:38.699 --> 27:40.284
and you...

27:40.451 --> 27:44.038
and you an apology.
Each and every single one of you...

27:44.205 --> 27:45.831
- Okay, okay.
- From the bottom of my heart.

27:45.998 --> 27:50.127
Yeah, okay, okay.
You've apologized enough

27:50.294 --> 27:52.505
for everybody, to everybody.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.840
Does everybody
accept my apology, though?

27:55.007 --> 27:57.468
'Cause that's the thing
that is so important to me.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.762
Yes.

28:00.805 --> 28:03.391
They're all accepting it, babe.
You did good.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.687
Really?

28:07.853 --> 28:09.563
- We were known as the Smash Crew.
- Mm-hmm.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.691
When we weren't smashin',
we were sleeping.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.984
And we always went to sleep
after we smashed.

28:14.151 --> 28:15.820
No cuddling.
Tell her about it, baby.

28:15.986 --> 28:18.781
- Smashing was dancing.
- Boom, yeah. That's what they call it.

28:18.948 --> 28:20.700
- Look, I... cheers.
- Andre's kidding. It's like dancing.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.660
No, it's funny.
I think it's funny.

28:22.827 --> 28:24.870
I married a former wigger
and I had no idea.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.706
It's hilarious.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.333
Yeah, you might wanna "achay"
on the "worday," you know?

28:30.710 --> 28:32.211
"The worday"?
What word?

28:32.378 --> 28:34.422
Wigger?

28:34.588 --> 28:36.757
- Yep, that one.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.218
I think, uh,
it's kind of offensive.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.303
- Is it?
- Who's offended? We ain't.

28:41.470 --> 28:42.504
- Not at all.
- They're not offended.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.223
- Boom.
- I know, but it's two words

28:44.390 --> 28:46.726
squished into one word,
and the one word would be offensive.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.644
Ooh-whee, time-out.
Twenty seconds.

28:48.811 --> 28:51.981
Excuse me, ladies.
Where are you guys sitting?

28:52.148 --> 28:54.400
I don't know.
You got a spot for us?

28:54.567 --> 28:57.361
I have a gentleman here who's willing
to open up two seats for you.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.071
- Yay.
- Oh, ladies. Please sit down.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.116
- Would you like to be our guest?
- Have a seat. Have a seat.

29:02.283 --> 29:03.868
All right.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.619
Wait. Wait. Time-out.

29:05.786 --> 29:07.246
Switch.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.956
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

29:09.123 --> 29:10.166
- Ouch.
- What?

29:10.332 --> 29:11.834
You coulda just said
you wanted to see...

29:12.001 --> 29:13.794
I just wanted to see you
across the table.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.756
- Uh-huh.
- Sit down, girl.

29:16.922 --> 29:17.923
- Well, hello.
- How you doin?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.216
- Good, how are you?
- Mm.

29:19.383 --> 29:20.760
- Mm-hmm.
- Can I call you Snuggie?

29:20.926 --> 29:22.386
Sure.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.346
- Uh, you want a beer?
- I'll get it.

29:24.513 --> 29:25.931
- You sure?
- You okay?

29:26.098 --> 29:28.100
- I'm good, thank you.
- Honey?

29:28.267 --> 29:29.935
- I'll just do water now.
- Water.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.562
Yeah.

29:31.729 --> 29:34.565
- I'm sorry. What?
- Yes, I'm drinking water.

29:34.732 --> 29:38.110
Yes, sorry. I lost the coin toss.
Designated driver.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.530
Jess, you have to come look
at this baby's face.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.824
- You're gonna die.
- I'm gonna go over there.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.493
- I'll be back.
- All right.

29:45.659 --> 29:48.287
Honey, look at this baby.
Look at that face.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.122
She is too much.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.373
Oh, my God.

29:51.540 --> 29:52.792
Seriously, why don't
you just stay here?

29:52.958 --> 29:55.127
No, we live... we're just 45 minutes
out of town.

29:55.294 --> 29:59.465
It's not that bad. It's so nice to...
sleep in your own bed.

29:59.632 --> 30:02.760
It makes me happy.

30:02.927 --> 30:04.929
I'm really kind of shocked.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.722
I didn't think
you were gonna show.

30:06.889 --> 30:09.809
- Sam said you weren't coming.
- I wasn't, actually.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.228
These things can kinda...

30:12.394 --> 30:14.313
he convinced me last minute
to come by.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.148
I think he's right.
I would've regretted it more...

30:16.315 --> 30:20.152
- Ah. Convinced you.
- ...had I not come.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.905
It's really good to see you.

30:24.323 --> 30:28.494
- You, too.
- Yeah, I tried to find you online.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.330
- Come on.
- There's a lot of Jake Staff ords.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.749
I'm just saying.
Shocking.

30:33.916 --> 30:35.543
You know I can't do any of that at all.

30:35.709 --> 30:38.838
- I'm technologically ignorant.
- Yeah.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.841
I don't have any of those things,
either, but I really...

30:42.007 --> 30:43.509
No, I know. I know.

30:45.052 --> 30:47.012
I looked.
You're not there, either.

30:50.641 --> 30:52.268
You're married, man.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.270
- That's a...
- Yeah.

30:55.271 --> 30:57.064
Well...

30:57.231 --> 30:58.899
- Thank you.
- Sure.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.527
- Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
- Cheers.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.028
Look who finally
decided to show up.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.572
- I know.
- Looks so awkward.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.198
It really is.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.702
I'm so glad I never dated anyone
who went to our high school.

31:09.869 --> 31:11.996
I could never handle that.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.581
- No?
- Mmm.

31:13.747 --> 31:17.293
Weren't you seeing someone
that whole year we had physics together?

31:17.459 --> 31:19.295
Mmmmm.
Randie Rustenberg.

31:19.461 --> 31:22.298
- Where is she?
- She's in Bolivia.

31:22.464 --> 31:23.507
- She...
- Wow.

31:23.674 --> 31:27.511
Yeah, she's a Jew for Jesus now.
She's down there doing missionary work.

31:28.554 --> 31:31.765
- She seemed so punk rock.
- Yeah, she was.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.977
I think that...

31:35.144 --> 31:36.586
you date who you're supposed
to like in high school.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.522
Not who you actually like.

31:40.316 --> 31:43.402
- Did you like your boyfriend?
- I loved my boyfriend.

31:43.569 --> 31:44.570
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:44.737 --> 31:46.405
Even after he moved to Austin?

31:47.740 --> 31:49.408
Ahem...

31:50.409 --> 31:51.911
- Oh, hello.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.495
- How you doing?
- Good.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.414
I just had to come
and tell you that "Never Had"

31:55.581 --> 31:56.916
is one of my top ten
favorite songs.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.251
Wow, thank you very much.
Thanks.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.419
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.921
Most favorite song ever.

32:02.087 --> 32:05.424
Ah, well. Let's not go crazy.
All right.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.302
So how did you remember
that he had moved to Austin?

32:08.469 --> 32:09.970
I don't know.
Do you have a cigarette?

32:10.137 --> 32:11.555
- Yeah, I do.
- I'm not just saying that

32:11.722 --> 32:14.683
- because we were classmates.
- Oh, no. Don't worry. I believe you.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.936
Can we smoke that?
Yeah, okay.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.145
- Bye.
- Nice to see you again.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.064
- Yeah, bye.
- All right, bye.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.835
- He wanted to date me and I...
- You were dating somebody

32:21.982 --> 32:23.692
- you were cooking with.
- That's not the way it was.

32:23.859 --> 32:24.860
- That's what you were doing.
- He wanted to date me

32:25.027 --> 32:27.279
- and I was with somebody already.
- And what happened?

32:27.446 --> 32:29.281
She left her purse over here.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.824
She was here?

32:30.991 --> 32:33.160
Yeah, well, you were sitting
at the buffet and...

32:33.327 --> 32:35.663
What? Okay, did she say anything
about being single?

32:35.829 --> 32:37.081
- Why wouldn't you tell me that?
- Well, she didn't have a ring

32:37.247 --> 32:38.457
on her finger.

32:38.624 --> 32:39.930
You looked at her finger?
You're a married man.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.605
- You looked at her finger.
- I did a ring check, I mean...

32:41.627 --> 32:43.337
Oh, a ring check.
Is that something guys do?

32:43.504 --> 32:45.255
You check... you always
check the ring, right, Scotty?

32:45.422 --> 32:48.342
Um, you know, I don't...
I don't really...

32:48.509 --> 32:50.928
- I don't... yeah, I checked.
- What?

32:51.095 --> 32:52.183
- Yeah, I checked.
- Is this a thing...

32:52.346 --> 32:54.974
Well, it's Anna. I went pretty hard
after her in high school, so I just...

32:55.140 --> 32:57.393
- I was curious.
- Okay, I gotta go talk to her.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.478
- I gotta go make a move.
- Let's get her over here.

32:59.645 --> 33:00.938
- We can ask questions.
- Oh, no, no, no.

33:01.105 --> 33:02.982
- No, no, no, it'd be good.
- No, no, no, don't do that.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.651
I'm gonna have one more drink
like a gentleman.

33:05.818 --> 33:07.396
- I'm gonna walk over there...
- Let's get her over here.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.255
- I think you're on the wrong page...
- Let's get her over here.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.573
- Anna. Anna.
- You're an asshole.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.492
What are you doing?
You forgot your purse.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.285
- You're crazy. Get over here.
- What an asshole.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.413
You know Marty.
You remember my friend Marty.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.239
- Don't say it to me like I'm retarded.
- You forgot your...

33:19.289 --> 33:20.666
In your falsetto,
condescending voice.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.710
Get over here.
You remember my little friend Marty.

33:22.876 --> 33:25.421
- Wow.
- You're in luck.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.673
- I don't even smoke.
- What? You used to smoke like a chimney

33:27.840 --> 33:29.591
- in high school.
- I know. I quit.

33:29.758 --> 33:32.094
I don't even remember
the last time I bought a pack.

33:32.261 --> 33:33.512
Well, Why'd you buy that one?

33:33.679 --> 33:37.307
I don't know. I woke up this morning
and suddenly had the urge.

33:37.474 --> 33:39.435
- No, no, thanks.
- Are you kidding me?

33:39.601 --> 33:40.769
You just asked me if I had one.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.841
Yes, because I wanted to get out
of there and I knew that you smoked.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.314
- I don't smoke.
- No?

33:44.481 --> 33:46.025
Mm-mm.

33:50.863 --> 33:51.947
Come on.

33:52.114 --> 33:53.532
- Just take one.
- Just be a bad influence, now.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.075
Loser, everybody's doing it.

33:55.242 --> 33:57.119
I've... honestly, I've never had
a cigarette in my entire life.

33:58.328 --> 34:00.205
How is that even possible?

34:00.372 --> 34:04.334
Aren't you supposed to be like,
this rock star?

34:04.501 --> 34:07.713
I'm not a rock star.
I'm just a musician.

34:09.797 --> 34:12.217
Traveling minstrel.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.719
Nice.

34:13.886 --> 34:17.056
So where's the Austin guy?

34:18.724 --> 34:20.559
Huh?

34:20.726 --> 34:22.311
- Where's he at?
- I don't know.

34:22.478 --> 34:24.897
- We haven't spoken in years.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.733
It's okay.
It's in the past.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.818
And what about the present?

34:29.985 --> 34:32.571
- What about the present?
- Do you have a boyfriend?

34:32.737 --> 34:34.822
Uh-huh.

34:35.824 --> 34:40.704
- Long distance again?
- No, actually. Same city.

34:40.871 --> 34:42.831
Well, where is he?

34:42.998 --> 34:45.083
He's in Chicago
at a partners' meeting.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.295
He's a partner.
He's a lawyer.

34:49.463 --> 34:51.380
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Wow.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.802
- Older?
- Yeah.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.428
- How much older?
- Older.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.097
Okay.

34:59.098 --> 35:01.016
How'd you meet?

35:01.183 --> 35:03.811
I... I sold his house.

35:05.729 --> 35:08.273
Okay, let me guess.
He's divorced?

35:09.358 --> 35:11.235
Okay, he's divorced.

35:11.401 --> 35:13.946
The wife got the kids,
he got the house.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.198
But he thought
it was too big for him, right?

35:16.365 --> 35:20.953
So he just wanted like, a cooler,
smaller bachelor pad in the city,

35:21.120 --> 35:23.455
somewhere in a high-rise?

35:23.622 --> 35:25.374
- Nope.
- No?

35:25.541 --> 35:28.544
No, no.
His new house is much bigger.

35:42.558 --> 35:44.560
- Those are different.

35:44.726 --> 35:46.603
- Stop.
- It's this machine.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.397
Are you getting everybody
on that, by the way?

35:48.564 --> 35:49.898
- I'm trying to.
- 'Cause I just...

35:50.065 --> 35:51.942
I can't just have it be your clique.
I need everybody.

35:52.109 --> 35:54.319
You're right. You're right. And I think
there's a lesson in there for me.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.321
Oh, good.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.073
Is that his mother's earring?

35:58.240 --> 35:59.783
Look, it looks like
a mother-of-pearl.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.869
- He got away with that. Nobody ever...
- I know, right?

36:02.035 --> 36:03.495
Back then it was, like,
that's how cool he is.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.747
He could wear, like...
he could dress like a Village Person

36:05.914 --> 36:08.292
- and still be cool.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.252
You had this amazing glow
in high school.

36:10.419 --> 36:12.671
Yeah.
All these pictures. Crazy.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.548
Well, I'd like to think
I still have that glow.

36:14.715 --> 36:16.300
- You do, I think.
- That's not what I...

36:16.466 --> 36:18.343
- I think you do.
- That's not what I meant.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.391
Oh, man.
Oh, no.

36:24.558 --> 36:26.268
- Yep.
- Can we not?

36:26.435 --> 36:27.853
That was senior year.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.314
- That was four days ago.
- Look how tiny you were.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.940
- Isn't it sad?

36:32.107 --> 36:33.567
I was a tween.
I was still a tween.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.112
I remember that day.
I got my first pube

36:37.279 --> 36:39.531
and I thought I was turning into
a ï¬‚y-human hybrid

36:39.698 --> 36:41.241
'cause I watched
too much science fiction.

36:41.408 --> 36:44.244
- You're so funny.
- Well, thanks.

36:44.411 --> 36:47.497
Clearly you had a much better time
in high school than I did.

36:47.664 --> 36:49.458
I had a much better time
in high school than you did.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.294
In fact, I think I had a much better
time in high school than anybody did.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.546
What was the secret?

36:54.713 --> 36:57.382
My mother actually...
she taught me very early on

36:57.549 --> 36:59.468
how to have a very good time.

36:59.635 --> 37:02.137
Wherever she is now,
she's probably drunk, having a blast.

37:02.304 --> 37:03.513
Photo op!

37:03.680 --> 37:05.224
That's why
whatever high school taught us,

37:05.390 --> 37:08.101
I'll always remember
my very first lesson.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.562
- Cheese.
- Yay!

37:10.729 --> 37:12.231
- Can I get a copy of that?
- Let me see it.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.785
- Should be one more.
- Oh, I gotta take this off.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.984
- No, that's beautiful.
- And my eyes are a little closed.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.569
- Do you want a hand with that?
- Here, I got it. I can get it.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.279
Okay.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.281
- All right. All righty.
- Okay.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.325
- So much better.
- Gorgeous.

37:23.492 --> 37:24.618
- Ready?
- All right, guys.

37:24.785 --> 37:26.411
One, two, three.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.829
Cheese.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.206
Oh, love it!

37:29.373 --> 37:31.375
Can I get a fresh one?

37:36.004 --> 37:38.090
You have a TV out here
or just the one back at the bar?

37:38.257 --> 37:40.092
I'm sorry, sir.
The TV's actually in the bar.

37:40.259 --> 37:41.510
Okay.

37:41.677 --> 37:44.429
You ain't no Jake, bro.

37:44.596 --> 37:47.349
Hey, honey.
Thanks for getting me a drink.

37:47.516 --> 37:48.767
- Is he kidding?
- Let me get you a drink.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.060
- No, it's fine.
- You sure?

37:50.227 --> 37:52.688
Yeah, no. I just would like my husband
to ask me if I'd like a drink.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.023
- It would be a nice gesture.
- You're the one that let him drink.

37:55.190 --> 37:57.484
Let him drink? He's a big boy.
I'm not his babysitter.

37:57.651 --> 37:59.778
Oh, come on. You know you're
his babysitter, so don't even...

37:59.945 --> 38:01.947
- let's go look at pictures.
- Why don't you go be his babysitter?

38:02.114 --> 38:03.282
- So I can have a night off.
- I think we're gonna...

38:03.448 --> 38:05.135
babe, we're just gonna stay here
and have a little girl time.

38:05.284 --> 38:06.785
- Okay. All right.
- Love you.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.705
Wait, wait, look. This is Andre.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.291
- That's funny. Yeah.
- He's dancing with his sister.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.503
Oh, my gosh.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.968
Oh, my God.
Is that you?

38:26.346 --> 38:28.348
Yep, that's me.

38:29.766 --> 38:30.976
Well, there it is.

38:31.143 --> 38:33.061
Yep. There it is.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.480
"G-Money."

38:37.649 --> 38:39.359
That's my friend,
Brock, right there.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.653
And with the "B.U.M. Equipment"
is Ross.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.572
- Where'd you go?
- Oh, I'm just...

38:43.739 --> 38:46.074
seeing if I can get
any more "G-Money."

39:00.839 --> 39:02.090
Hmm.

39:02.257 --> 39:04.092
Shit.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.345
Why's it feel so long ago?

39:09.848 --> 39:12.851
Uh-huh.
Sassy.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.563
Look at that.
Was that Christmas?

39:16.730 --> 39:18.065
Yeah, it was.

39:20.609 --> 39:22.903
And this was prom.

39:28.617 --> 39:30.369
I guess so.

39:30.535 --> 39:33.455
You know, I got my tiara like,
two, three weeks later.

39:40.170 --> 39:43.173
Sorry you didn't get to wear it.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.344
I wore it.

39:48.762 --> 39:50.305
It was only in my room, but...

39:50.472 --> 39:52.891
- I wore it.

39:53.934 --> 39:55.894
No, sorry.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.190
No.

40:00.357 --> 40:02.150
You don't wanna go over there?

40:02.317 --> 40:03.693
No.

40:05.612 --> 40:06.905
Do you wanna go over there?

40:07.906 --> 40:09.157
I love you.

40:10.784 --> 40:13.161
- Right?
- Mm-mm.

40:13.328 --> 40:14.746
No.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.165
I love each and all of you.
Thank you for accepting my apology.

40:17.332 --> 40:20.377
Allowing us to be
besties again...

40:20.544 --> 40:22.379
for the first time.

40:22.546 --> 40:24.089
- It's fine.
- It is fine. It's great.

40:24.256 --> 40:25.924
It's better than fine.
It's awesome.

40:26.091 --> 40:29.594
Because if you didn't accept my apology,
I would have to force you to.

40:29.761 --> 40:32.597
But I wouldn't use my fists,
'cause I ain't like that.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.016
- I'd use my tongue.
- Sorry.

40:35.183 --> 40:37.102
Not only that,
it wouldn't be violent.

40:37.269 --> 40:39.271
It would be tender.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.148
You would be like my cell mate.

40:41.314 --> 40:43.191
- And I would swallow...
- Oh, God.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.277
My pride.

40:45.444 --> 40:47.404
Sicko.

40:47.571 --> 40:51.783
Get your little funny-shaped head
out of the gutter there, chipmunk.

40:54.494 --> 40:55.579
- What is your problem?
- Honey.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.789
What? He knows I'm joking.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.292
He know... come on, come here.
You know I'm kidding, right?

41:00.459 --> 41:02.002
No, no. No, no.
Please...

41:02.169 --> 41:03.211
- Come on, hug it out.
- Honey...

41:03.378 --> 41:04.466
I don't think you look
like a chipmunk.

41:04.588 --> 41:06.756
I just can't...

41:06.923 --> 41:11.011
Hey, hey, Peter.
Hi. I'm sorry that...

41:11.178 --> 41:12.471
thanks for being
such a good sport.

41:12.637 --> 41:15.724
I... you know... I know he can be
a little aggressive and,

41:15.891 --> 41:18.727
you know, he's had
one too many drinks.

41:18.894 --> 41:21.021
But he really means well

41:21.188 --> 41:24.232
and he really is
such a sweet guy.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.318
And I know it was really important
to him to talk to you.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.738
No, no, no. it's...
I'm sorry.

41:29.905 --> 41:32.866
'Cause you must have
to say this to a lot of people.

41:33.033 --> 41:34.326
Huh?

41:35.869 --> 41:37.787
I... I have to go.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.917
So, if I want a new house,
I should call you.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.794
Whatever.
I'm sure you need all sorts of houses

41:44.961 --> 41:47.547
for all those baby mamas
and groupies.

41:47.714 --> 41:48.757
Baby mamas?

41:48.924 --> 41:51.343
No, baby mamas get
their own baby mama condos,

41:51.510 --> 41:53.929
typically, and the groupies
are more of a road thing.

41:54.095 --> 41:55.972
Please, can I see your tour bus?

41:56.139 --> 41:58.517
"Never Had" is, like,
the best song of all time.

41:58.683 --> 42:01.102
- Yeah?
- Totally. Totes.

42:03.230 --> 42:05.941
- Best song?
- Ever.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.198
That song...

42:14.533 --> 42:17.327
I wrote it in like, two hours
and it barely made the album.

42:17.494 --> 42:19.579
It's kind of crazy
how people like it so much.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.791
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:26.586 --> 42:29.214
Have you never heard the song?

42:29.381 --> 42:32.884
Yeah. What?

42:34.261 --> 42:36.721
I... I mean, you just
have to understand that...

42:36.888 --> 42:40.392
lam in the car all the time
'cause of my job.

42:40.559 --> 42:43.562
- Uh-huh.
- And I've got satellite radio,

42:43.728 --> 42:46.481
but I'm more of a talk radio
kind of girl.

42:46.648 --> 42:48.942
Uh-huh.

42:49.109 --> 42:52.445
You know what? I bet if I heard it,
I would recognize it.

42:52.612 --> 42:55.907
I'm sure.
I'm sure if I heard it, I'd know it.

42:57.367 --> 43:00.161
The truth is,
I was only distantly aware

43:00.328 --> 43:02.414
that you were a musician.

43:07.669 --> 43:10.880
It's okay. It's all right.

43:12.215 --> 43:16.344
You're just... you're just telling me
that you're not with it.

43:16.511 --> 43:18.305
- Right?
- Sorry.

43:18.471 --> 43:21.141
It's all right.
Don't apologize.

43:21.308 --> 43:23.351
Hey, I really would love
to hear you play.

43:24.811 --> 43:27.188
It's pathetic
that I haven't heard you.

43:28.773 --> 43:31.610
It's not. No, it's not.
It's not pathetic.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.903
It just means that...

43:34.070 --> 43:36.156
that you're one of the few people here
that's talking to me

43:36.323 --> 43:38.867
because of who I was,
not because of who I am.

43:42.954 --> 43:44.873
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.626
So...

43:47.792 --> 43:49.878
how many times
has he been divorced?

43:51.546 --> 43:53.882
- Twice.
- Twice?

43:54.883 --> 43:57.218
Third time's a charm.
That's what they say, right?

43:57.385 --> 43:59.137
Neither of us
want to get married, so...

43:59.304 --> 44:00.930
You don't want to get married?

44:02.307 --> 44:05.185
No? You don't wanna be
someone's wife someday?

44:07.437 --> 44:10.148
You don't wanna be
someone's third wife someday?

44:12.651 --> 44:15.153
It's cold.
Let's go inside.

44:19.157 --> 44:21.993
Well, well, well.
Where have you been all night?

44:22.160 --> 44:25.038
Just taking care
of my third child.

44:25.205 --> 44:26.498
Let's just get drunk.

44:26.665 --> 44:28.500
- I can't. I have to drive.
- Oh, crap. Sorry.

44:28.667 --> 44:30.210
Mary? Mary?

44:30.377 --> 44:31.836
Wait. This... oh.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.546
- Come here. Hey.
- Scott.

44:33.713 --> 44:35.256
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my goodness.

44:35.423 --> 44:37.550
I heard you weren't gonna be here
and then I heard that you were and...

44:37.717 --> 44:39.219
- This is my husband.
- How are you?

44:39.386 --> 44:41.846
- Scott. It's a... pull up a chair.
- How's your night been?

44:42.013 --> 44:45.058
Great, actually.
It's been really trippy

44:45.225 --> 44:47.686
to look through
all these photographs

44:47.852 --> 44:49.521
and realize how old
we've gotten.

44:49.688 --> 44:50.855
- We're not that old.
- This one's finding out all my

44:51.022 --> 44:53.149
- secrets and tricks and everything.
- I feel old.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.777
No, you definitely
didn't ask me to prom, AJ.

44:55.944 --> 44:59.239
I would've remembered it.
Definitely.

44:59.406 --> 45:01.783
You sure I never asked you?
I had to have asked you.

45:01.950 --> 45:03.702
No.

45:03.868 --> 45:06.329
Jason Maclntyre, Mike Brighty,

45:06.496 --> 45:08.748
Gabe Vertz asked me.

45:08.915 --> 45:10.875
You asked me to prom.

45:11.042 --> 45:13.169
But never you, AJ

45:13.336 --> 45:15.296
Oh, the carcass is ï¬‚oating
in the water already.

45:15.463 --> 45:18.216
Who'd you finally say yes to?
You went with a college guy.

45:18.383 --> 45:19.884
I went with a guy
who wasn't in our class.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.053
You went with a college guy.
So boring.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.221
Anyway, I thought prom
was kind of boring.

45:23.388 --> 45:26.015
- Sort of like a waste of time.
- No. No, no.

45:26.182 --> 45:28.059
- Prom was awesome.
- I hated prom.

45:28.226 --> 45:29.436
I had the most miserable time,
but I don't think it was a waste...

45:29.602 --> 45:32.564
I think that's the point of prom...
to have a miserable time, right?

45:32.731 --> 45:34.149
I went with Jenny Sakamora.

45:34.315 --> 45:36.067
- Remember Jenny Sakamora?
- Wow.

45:36.234 --> 45:39.028
She looked like one of
the Sand People in Star Wars.

45:39.195 --> 45:41.114
And the worst breath...
you can't believe this breath.

45:41.281 --> 45:43.575
And she wouldn't kiss me. That was
the irony. Wouldn't kiss me all night.

45:43.742 --> 45:47.078
I don't think it was a waste of time.
That's kind of the point.

45:47.245 --> 45:48.714
I think it's supposed to be,
like, a rite of passage.

45:48.872 --> 45:51.791
I mean, can you imagine not being
disappointed at your prom?

45:51.958 --> 45:53.585
Seriously.

45:53.752 --> 45:56.004
Well, I mean... sorry.
You guys excluded.

45:56.171 --> 45:58.047
I'm sure you guys
weren't disappointed at prom.

45:58.214 --> 46:01.342
You genetic...
you genetic superhumans.

46:01.509 --> 46:03.428
- Ahem...
- What?

46:03.595 --> 46:07.682
- We didn't go, man. Remember?
- Yeah.

46:07.849 --> 46:11.561
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

46:11.728 --> 46:14.147
Why's he apologizing?

46:14.314 --> 46:16.608
Well, actually,
I didn't make it to prom because

46:16.775 --> 46:20.653
that was the first time
Dad had a heart attack.

46:22.322 --> 46:24.407
And so we just...
we didn't make it.

46:24.574 --> 46:27.452
We actually spent... I spent prom
in a hospital room with Jake.

46:30.288 --> 46:31.915
Oh.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.586
Dude, we're going to Pretzels.

46:36.753 --> 46:38.963
We're all going to Pretzels.
Let's go.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.840
Oh, look. It's my husband,
the event coordinator.

46:41.007 --> 46:42.133
- Let's go!
- Oh, no.

46:42.300 --> 46:43.551
We're not... we're not really
going to Pretzels, are we?

46:43.718 --> 46:45.345
Yes, we are! Yes, we are.

46:45.512 --> 46:48.932
How is it possible that I'm not
in any of these pictures?

46:49.098 --> 46:52.101
It's like I didn't even go to school
with you guys.

46:52.268 --> 46:53.436
Maybe you don't really exist.

46:53.603 --> 46:56.189
I was very camera-shy, maybe.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.859
No, there's one.
There's gotta be one somewhere.

47:00.026 --> 47:01.778
I don't know.

47:01.945 --> 47:04.113
Anna.
We're doing shots.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.573
One more before Pretzels.

47:05.740 --> 47:07.158
I just need to steal her
for one photo.

47:07.325 --> 47:08.493
- Yeah, one photo.
- Real quick.

47:08.660 --> 47:10.870
Come back, though.
We're gonna be here.

47:14.707 --> 47:17.877
- What the hell are you doing?
- What are you talking about?

47:18.044 --> 47:19.379
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

47:19.546 --> 47:21.881
You're flirting with her.
All night you've been ï¬‚irting with her.

47:22.048 --> 47:23.716
Don't be an asshole.

47:23.883 --> 47:26.219
I'm not being an asshole.
I just want... you're married.

47:26.386 --> 47:27.887
You remember, you're married
and you have a boat.

47:28.054 --> 47:29.264
I just wanted to make sure
you know that.

47:29.430 --> 47:31.015
- I do remember, Marty.
- You remember? Good, good, good.

47:31.182 --> 47:33.560
- I just want to make sure you remember.
- I especially remember.

47:33.726 --> 47:35.979
What does that mean,
"I especially remember"?

47:36.145 --> 47:40.275
It means...
I don't get to...

47:42.110 --> 47:44.571
- I don't get to do this.
- What are you talking about?

47:44.737 --> 47:45.738
- Do this?
- What do you care?

47:45.905 --> 47:48.074
You sleep with models.

48:04.924 --> 48:07.010
I slept with a model.

48:07.176 --> 48:09.345
Once, okay?

48:09.512 --> 48:10.763
No, I'm saying.
I'm just...

48:10.930 --> 48:12.932
- And she was a plus-sized model.
- What?

48:14.100 --> 48:15.476
What?

48:15.643 --> 48:17.979
You didn't tell me that.

48:18.146 --> 48:19.606
Whatever,
she was a plus-sized model.

48:19.772 --> 48:20.940
- You didn't tell me...
- She was still a model, okay?

48:21.107 --> 48:22.108
She was still a model.

48:22.275 --> 48:23.526
I found you.

48:23.693 --> 48:25.153
You did?

48:25.320 --> 48:27.280
You "Oh, my gosh"!

48:27.447 --> 48:29.073
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

48:29.240 --> 48:30.575
I love blurred
in the background.

48:30.742 --> 48:33.369
I forgot about those yellow shoes.

48:33.536 --> 48:35.830
- You forgot about 'em?
- Oh, wow.

48:35.997 --> 48:38.166
- I didn't.
- I was obsessed with...

48:38.333 --> 48:41.920
those were the first designer anything
I ever bought.

48:42.086 --> 48:44.297
- I wore those all the time.
- Yeah, I remember.

48:44.464 --> 48:47.258
I'd wear those in gym class
if they let me.

48:49.093 --> 48:52.639
Oh.
Look at me.

48:52.805 --> 48:55.224
Even there I look like
I just can't wait to get out.

48:55.391 --> 48:57.226
- Yeah.
- I would've never guessed

48:57.393 --> 49:00.730
that I'd come to something like this
ten years later.

49:03.274 --> 49:05.318
How come you did?

49:06.986 --> 49:08.655
- Mmm.
- You don't know?

49:08.821 --> 49:10.657
Whoa!

49:10.823 --> 49:13.493
Oh, my God. Dude.

49:13.660 --> 49:16.162
You coming to Pretzels,
you little bitch? Let's go to Pretzels.

49:16.329 --> 49:17.997
- You're going to Pretzels right now?
- I was talking to him, not to you.

49:18.164 --> 49:19.582
- Oh. Yeah.
- Come on. But you can come.

49:19.749 --> 49:21.000
- I'm not calling you a bitch.
- Oh, thanks. That's really nice.

49:21.167 --> 49:22.609
- You guys are going right now?
- Come on! Pretzels!

49:22.752 --> 49:24.462
Okay. Okay.

49:25.922 --> 49:28.341
You... you wanna
come to Pretzels?

49:28.508 --> 49:31.052
Why would I need
to feel better about myself?

49:31.219 --> 49:32.845
That's exactly my point.
You don't, AJ.

49:33.012 --> 49:34.973
You own a frickin' boat,
so I don't know what you're doing.

49:35.139 --> 49:36.724
What... what is wrong
with you and the boat?

49:36.891 --> 49:37.934
You're acting
like a crazy person.

49:38.101 --> 49:40.853
Oh, yeah. I'm acting like a... shh.
Hey.

49:41.020 --> 49:42.689
You ready to go?
A little Pretzels?

49:42.855 --> 49:45.984
I left my fake I.D. at home.

49:46.150 --> 49:48.528
You're gonna need that.

49:50.029 --> 49:51.447
Sorry, guys.

49:51.614 --> 49:52.907
You're not coming?

49:53.074 --> 49:55.076
That doesn't sound like
the Anna we remember.

49:55.243 --> 49:57.620
Yeah, the Anna in those pictures
would never leave a party early.

49:57.787 --> 49:59.580
- Come on.
- The Anna in those pictures

49:59.747 --> 50:01.416
- was the party.
- Yeah, right.

50:02.458 --> 50:04.293
Wait. We're good?

50:04.460 --> 50:07.714
You're a big city boy now.
Let's see how you do on your own.

50:13.428 --> 50:15.096
Hey, you guys. We're going to Pretzels.
You guys going to Pretzels?

50:15.263 --> 50:18.141
Pretzels? Moving on? Pretzels?
You guys going to Pretzels?

50:18.307 --> 50:19.804
Oh, you guys gotta sign
the memory book before you go.

50:19.892 --> 50:20.893
- Oh...
- Just sign it.

50:21.060 --> 50:22.448
- We're gonna miss...
- Nope, you got two seconds.

50:22.562 --> 50:25.064
- Just sign it. You gotta sign it.
- Come on, let's sign it.

50:25.231 --> 50:26.566
- Uh...
- Hey, Jake.

50:26.733 --> 50:28.901
Yo, Jake.
Let's do it, bro.

50:31.029 --> 50:33.906
- Oh, my God.

50:34.073 --> 50:35.575
The thing broke.

50:37.076 --> 50:39.037
- Are you all right?
- Nope, I'm good.

50:39.203 --> 50:41.664
Get on the couch.
Go sit on the couch.

50:42.957 --> 50:44.542
Julie?

50:44.709 --> 50:45.835
- I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

50:46.002 --> 50:48.546
- No, I didn't...
- Go apologize to Julie.

50:48.713 --> 50:50.548
- Are you gonna apologize to her?
- What happened?

50:50.715 --> 50:53.551
Nothing happened other than Sam
is actually gonna kill him, I think.

50:53.718 --> 50:54.844
No, I don't have your jacket.

50:57.430 --> 51:01.517
Uh, look. I just gotta tell you.
I'm happy you decided to come.

51:03.227 --> 51:05.605
Can I tell you something?

51:06.606 --> 51:08.441
You're the only reason I did.

51:12.445 --> 51:14.614
I'll see you at Pretzels.

51:14.781 --> 51:16.449
Okay.

51:19.452 --> 51:20.661
You did an amazing job, Julie.

51:20.828 --> 51:22.830
- Really? You sure?
- Don't worry about it.

51:23.831 --> 51:26.459
Ah, ha ha.
Scotty P, "Sukiwaba."

51:26.626 --> 51:28.461
Let's go to Pretzels
and find some victims.

51:28.628 --> 51:30.171
- Arf, arf, arf.
- Oh, God.

51:30.338 --> 51:32.298
Pretzels? Yeah.

51:32.465 --> 51:33.925
Pretzels?
Bye, Snoopy.

51:34.092 --> 51:36.177
- Bye, Snoops.
- Pretzels.

51:36.344 --> 51:38.304
Let's go, baby.
Ow!

51:39.305 --> 51:41.349
I don't understand
why she's leaving already.

51:41.516 --> 51:43.059
She's too fun to be leaving.

51:43.226 --> 51:45.144
Without one of us, you mean.

51:49.941 --> 51:51.859
Would you-I mean, honestly.

51:52.026 --> 51:54.612
Would you have actually
gone home with her?

51:56.155 --> 51:57.990
I just wanted to know
I could've...

51:58.157 --> 52:00.785
if I wanted to.

52:01.828 --> 52:04.330
You know?

52:05.873 --> 52:06.999
- Right.
- But that's...

52:07.166 --> 52:09.168
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I get it.

52:13.214 --> 52:15.216
You okay, pal?

52:19.345 --> 52:22.098
You're right.

52:23.432 --> 52:25.518
I shouldn't have
bought the boat.

52:27.562 --> 52:29.188
- It was stupid. I...
- You wanted a boat.

52:29.355 --> 52:32.441
No, I just... I've taken
the boat out one time.

52:33.442 --> 52:35.778
I don't even have access
to water where I live. It doesn't...

52:35.945 --> 52:37.488
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

52:37.655 --> 52:40.366
Well, you gave it a shot.
I don't know why, but...

52:40.533 --> 52:43.327
I can't even pretend to be
a boat guy.

52:45.163 --> 52:47.456
You wanted a boat.
Pfft.

52:50.126 --> 52:52.128
It was so great to see you.

52:53.713 --> 52:55.798
I want that boat.

52:56.799 --> 52:59.343
- You know what we should do?
- Huh?

53:00.344 --> 53:03.598
We should follow her home.

53:03.764 --> 53:06.726
That's a little creepy.

53:07.727 --> 53:09.645
Toilet paper her house.

53:11.772 --> 53:13.232
Yeah? You want to?

53:35.421 --> 53:36.797
You wanna do karaoke?

53:36.964 --> 53:38.799
No.

53:38.966 --> 53:40.092
You want a drink?

53:40.259 --> 53:41.427
Okay.

53:41.594 --> 53:43.304
- All right.
- Beer.

53:43.471 --> 53:44.847
Okay.

53:48.351 --> 53:50.478
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

53:53.272 --> 53:55.358
- What do you need, guy?
- 12 tequila shots.

53:55.524 --> 53:57.902
- What?
- 12 tequila shots.

53:58.069 --> 53:59.528
- Honey, give me the debit card.
- No.

53:59.695 --> 54:01.113
I am not gonna pay
for those shots.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.348
- You're not. I'm gonna pay for them.
- No, you're not. It's my debit card.

54:03.407 --> 54:05.618
Let go. Let go.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.623
I'm so...

54:10.790 --> 54:12.959
I've told you about Jake.
I've told you about my dad.

54:13.125 --> 54:14.460
Come on.
Are you kidding me?

54:14.627 --> 54:16.170
There's so much awkwardness
that's going on.

54:16.337 --> 54:18.798
Are you gonna pretend like there's not
an awkward thing that happens

54:18.965 --> 54:20.258
at 10-year reunions?

54:20.424 --> 54:21.634
We remember old stuff
from the past.

54:21.801 --> 54:24.512
A lot of it, for me,
has to do with my dad.

54:24.679 --> 54:27.640
It's not all pleasant, happy memories.
It does feel awkward.

54:27.807 --> 54:29.141
- Okay.
- Sorry.

54:39.777 --> 54:41.821
I'm gonna go check on Cully.

54:41.988 --> 54:43.531
You just... are you gonna pay
for these shots?

54:43.698 --> 54:46.325
Mm-mm.
I'll be right back.

54:50.454 --> 54:52.248
I'm tired.

54:55.209 --> 54:56.711
Do you want a drink?
I can get you a beer.

54:56.877 --> 54:58.963
- No, go talk to your friends.
- I will, thank you.

54:59.130 --> 55:01.007
I'll see you in a little bit.

55:08.556 --> 55:10.057
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

55:10.224 --> 55:12.143
I'll see you in a little bit.

55:13.728 --> 55:14.729
Do you wanna go outside
and have a cigarette?

55:14.895 --> 55:16.522
- Yes. Yes, please.
- You do?

55:16.689 --> 55:17.940
Okay, let's go.

55:18.107 --> 55:19.525
It's time to get on the ï¬‚oor.
Dre!

55:19.692 --> 55:21.360
Dre, I see you out there, baby.
Come on.

55:21.527 --> 55:24.363
- Watch this.
- Get your bootie on the ï¬‚oor.

55:25.531 --> 55:26.782
Listen up.
Whoo.

55:36.250 --> 55:37.752
Let's go, ladies.

55:43.507 --> 55:45.134
G-Money's in the building!

55:52.391 --> 55:53.893
No, I gotta get back to my wife.

55:54.060 --> 55:55.936
Get it in, G.
Come on, G.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.397
Cosmic sandwich,
cosmic sandwich.

56:04.653 --> 56:07.656
- Show 'em what you got, baby!

56:07.823 --> 56:08.908
Yeah, G!

56:09.075 --> 56:10.409
Come on!

56:24.673 --> 56:26.967
Watch this, watch this.
He's going in. He's going in.

56:27.134 --> 56:30.012
Ho! Ho! Ho!

56:30.179 --> 56:31.597
Watch out!

56:43.067 --> 56:44.944
That's how we do it at Pretzels.

56:45.111 --> 56:47.238
Keep it up for the rest of the night,
baby. Let's do this.

56:49.615 --> 56:51.742
G-Money's in the house.

56:54.412 --> 56:56.163
Haven't done that in a while.

56:59.208 --> 57:00.793
What?

57:02.128 --> 57:03.504
That was insane.

57:05.131 --> 57:07.800
That was really, really good.

57:07.967 --> 57:10.469
Yeah. Really?

57:24.066 --> 57:25.359
- Hi.
- Hi.

57:25.526 --> 57:27.194
Hi.

57:30.573 --> 57:32.241
I hate that there's always
a line for the girls.

57:32.408 --> 57:34.910
I know. It's so unfair.

57:35.077 --> 57:36.996
Men have it way easier.

57:37.163 --> 57:39.331
No. Jake and I
used to race each other.

57:39.498 --> 57:42.001
I'm quick.

57:42.168 --> 57:44.795
Now I'm gonna have to be quick, though.
Since I said that.

57:47.965 --> 57:49.633
All right.

57:58.392 --> 58:00.144
All right, slow down.

58:00.311 --> 58:02.563
- Kill the lights.
- Oh, shit.

58:04.523 --> 58:06.984
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

58:07.151 --> 58:09.111
No, no, no.

58:09.278 --> 58:11.780
Why does that house
look so familiar?

58:11.947 --> 58:13.866
I feel like we've been here before.

58:14.033 --> 58:15.701
- Really?
- Wait a minute.

58:15.868 --> 58:19.121
Dude, that's... I think that's
the house she grew up in.

58:21.790 --> 58:23.042
Yeah.

58:23.209 --> 58:25.085
Well, it's a nice house.

58:25.252 --> 58:26.921
Yeah.

58:28.839 --> 58:31.675
What do we do?
We just wait for her to go to bed?

58:31.842 --> 58:33.802
Let's... let's get supplies.

58:33.969 --> 58:35.221
Okay.

58:35.387 --> 58:39.016
Let's get a lot of supplies. I want to
paint this house whiter than a...

58:39.183 --> 58:42.770
- A Jimmy Buffet concert?
- A Jimmy Buffet concert.

58:42.937 --> 58:46.232
- A Phish show.
- Fo' sho.

58:46.398 --> 58:49.151
No, a Phish show.
Like the band Phish.

58:49.318 --> 58:50.945
Fo' shizo.

59:04.416 --> 59:06.544
I don't know
if that was horribly good

59:06.710 --> 59:08.462
or horribly bad
or horribly amazing.

59:08.629 --> 59:09.636
- Amazing.
- I know she was amazing,

59:09.797 --> 59:11.423
but I'm not sure
about you and Frantz.

59:11.590 --> 59:13.634
She's amazing, isn't she?
I told you she was amazing.

59:13.801 --> 59:15.928
You're next, Jake.
And you're gonna do it with me, too.

59:16.095 --> 59:17.721
- Yeah, you're next.
- Hey, hey.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.765
Hey.

59:19.932 --> 59:22.893
- Where you been?
- Baby, I think I'm gonna go.

59:23.060 --> 59:25.604
- What? No.
- Yeah. No, it's fine.

59:25.771 --> 59:28.566
It's totally fine.
I'm just really tired.

59:28.732 --> 59:30.109
Okay, okay. All right.
Let me just say bye to everybody.

59:30.276 --> 59:31.443
No, no.
I want you to stay.

59:31.610 --> 59:33.112
- No, I want him to stay.
- We just met you.

59:33.279 --> 59:34.912
- I want you to catch up.
- I'm not gonna stay without you.

59:35.072 --> 59:36.949
I swear to God,
I'm just really tired.

59:37.116 --> 59:40.119
It's fine.
It's totally fine. It's fine.

59:40.286 --> 59:42.371
Just give me one minute.
I'm gonna talk to her.

59:42.538 --> 59:44.623
I'm not even gonna say goodbye.
'Cause I'll see you in a minute.

59:52.756 --> 59:55.134
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Case.

59:55.301 --> 59:57.928
You have no idea
what we're gonna do with this.

59:58.095 --> 01:00:00.222
No idea.
How are we...

01:00:00.389 --> 01:00:03.183
We're gonna be wiping
our asses for years.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.394
How are we gonna carry
all these?

01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:08.147
Oh, shit.
That's a good point.

01:00:08.314 --> 01:00:11.650
Hey, Casey. Do you sell these
in a much bigger package?

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:13.485
Make it easier to carry?

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:16.488
I mean, like a 72-count pack?

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:20.034
No?

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.577
Look, if you wanna go,
let's just go.

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:23.495
No, I want to go.
I don't want you to go.

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:26.290
No, I don't care.
I'm not gonna just stay here.

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:28.584
Oh, my God.
Please let me have the keys.

01:00:28.751 --> 01:00:30.628
- No. Why?
- Can I have the keys?

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:33.005
- Tell me why.
- Why? I'm tired.

01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:36.216
- That's it.
- But why?

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:37.843
What's... what is the deal?

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:39.511
Okay.

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:43.057
- What happened?
- With what?

01:00:44.058 --> 01:00:45.476
Come on.

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:47.811
You know,
I know everything about her.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.355
But I don't know
why you guys broke up.

01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:51.482
You've never told me
what happened.

01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:58.364
I don't know.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.204
Her dad died.

01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:08.540
So she stayed here
and I stayed with her.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:14.797
And I don't...
things got really serious after that.

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:20.928
I don't know.
I stayed as long as I could...

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:24.390
till I just couldn't stay any more.

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:27.810
I just needed to go to college
and grow up.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.064
So have you grown up now?

01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:35.651
What... what kind of-come on.
What... I don't...

01:01:35.818 --> 01:01:38.570
I really don't understand.
What you want me to say here?

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:41.031
- Okay, let's just go.
- I don't want you to go.

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:42.866
- I don't...
- I don't want you to go.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.369
Jake, I don't want you to go.

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:48.831
It's your 10-year reunion.

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:50.958
Just go inside.
I'm tired.

01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:52.876
Come back when you're ready.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.265
Uh-oh.

01:02:06.432 --> 01:02:09.601
Garrity, now that's what I call
a rump roast.

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.478
No, I get down.

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:14.356
Hey.
Your girl got a little bit,

01:02:14.523 --> 01:02:16.316
but she's shakin' what she's got.

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:17.943
She got some moves,
doesn't she?

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:19.945
- Yeah.
- They're my new friends.

01:02:20.112 --> 01:02:21.530
- Have fun.
- I'm her new friend.

01:02:21.697 --> 01:02:23.115
I have new friends.

01:02:23.282 --> 01:02:25.993
- You locked down a good one.
- Yeah, I know.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.580
Now me...
I'm about to go on a safari.

01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:34.168
You're really never gonna
settle down, are you?

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:37.838
Nah.
I tried already.

01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:40.257
Yeah? What happened?

01:02:42.468 --> 01:02:44.762
Didn't stick.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:51.477
They love me. I'm fun.

01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:56.106
Come here, girl.
Mmm-mm.

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:00.027
Come on, man.
Get in this.

01:03:00.194 --> 01:03:01.487
Okay, that was fun.
That was fun.

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:03.071
- What are we doing next?
- Yeah.

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:05.824
- Vanilla Ice?
- Ooh, genius. I like that.

01:03:07.159 --> 01:03:10.537
- So no go with Jess?
- She was tired.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:17.753
- You all right, man?
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.171
- What?
- Hey, guys.

01:03:19.338 --> 01:03:21.340
- What's up?
- Oh, look who decides to hang out

01:03:21.507 --> 01:03:23.842
- for a second.
- Yeah. What's going on?

01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:25.677
You're in town for one night.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.721
And we haven't seen you once.
What's going on?

01:03:27.888 --> 01:03:29.264
- You guilting me?
- Maybe a little bit, yeah.

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:30.557
Aww.

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:33.018
- Who's the girl?
- Elise?

01:03:33.185 --> 01:03:35.020
Mm-hmm.
Who's Elise?

01:03:35.187 --> 01:03:36.313
What do you mean,
"Who's Elise"?

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.023
- We went to school with her.
- Yeah, man.

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:40.192
Physics class.
Mr. Ferguson.

01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:44.696
Nope, nothing.

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:47.032
What's going on with Mary?
How's it going?

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.576
What do you mean,
"How's it going"?

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:52.037
Is she how you remember her?

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:54.915
No.

01:03:55.082 --> 01:03:56.375
No?

01:03:56.542 --> 01:03:59.336
- But no one is, so...
- I know.

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:01.046
- It's weird.
- It's cool.

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:03.257
- It's cool?
- Yeah, I like it.

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:04.758
You're so weird.

01:04:10.097 --> 01:04:11.557
Oh, shit.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.935
This one's for
the Goo Goo Dolls.

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:18.689
This one's for Darfur.

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:21.233
It's so soft. I can't wait to use it
on my ass later.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.235
Should we use eggs?
Should we use eggs? Too much?

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:25.737
- I think we're good for now.
- Okay.

01:04:25.904 --> 01:04:27.072
- Thanks.
- Let's do it at the same time.

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:28.448
- Okay.
- Give yourself a little tail.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:30.367
- It's really nice.
- Oh, that's a good tail.

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:31.618
How long is your tail?

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:34.830
- See, my tail keeps breaking off.
- That's a good tail.

01:04:34.997 --> 01:04:37.249
- Okay, you ready?
- Fo' sho!

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:44.631
- So much.
- There's so much already.

01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:46.925
- It's actually kind of beautiful.
- It's really beautiful.

01:04:49.428 --> 01:04:53.599
- I hope she finds the beauty in it.
- I think she will.

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:55.893
Get your money out,
people. Don't be shy.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:57.811
- I'm still waiting on that beer, bro.
- Get your money out.

01:04:57.978 --> 01:04:59.688
I mean, you got the time here.

01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:01.690
- What do you need?
- Yo, what's the holdup?

01:05:01.857 --> 01:05:04.026
- I see you.
- Hey.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:07.738
Where's... where's Paul?

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:10.449
Um, early day tomorrow.

01:05:10.616 --> 01:05:14.119
- So called it a night.
- Mm.

01:05:14.286 --> 01:05:15.913
Jer.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.706
- Jer?
- Where's Jess?

01:05:17.873 --> 01:05:19.875
Uh, same.

01:05:20.042 --> 01:05:21.627
Tired.

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:24.254
Tired.
She went back to the hotel.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.883
I think they're both tired
of our 10-year reunion.

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:29.051
I would be.

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:30.594
- Jen
- They should've shared a cab.

01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:33.680
- That would've been awkward.
- There's only one of me.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:35.807
Excuse me, miss.
I'm so sorry.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.186
I'm going in.

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:42.064
- Who wants a drink?
- What are you doing?

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:44.316
Baby, you in the weeds.
I'm just helping you out, all right?

01:05:44.483 --> 01:05:46.860
- Everybody pays. Everybody pays.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:48.820
Okay.
Who's next? Get your money out.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:51.406
- Uh, beer.
- What kind of beer? Bud?

01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:53.659
- Bud's fine.
- That's fine? Good.

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:55.702
There you go. Bam.
Done. Mary, you?

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.120
Um, just water.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.915
- You better be driving.
- I am driving.

01:06:00.082 --> 01:06:02.334
All right, all right. Water it is.
You fine, you fine.

01:06:02.501 --> 01:06:03.961
- Baby, what do you want?

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.380
- Jack and Coke.
- Jack and Coke? Jack and Coke.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:09.257
Man, I made some serious drinks
while I was over in Japan.

01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:11.510
- I'm keeping all the tips.
- Amazing drinks.

01:06:11.677 --> 01:06:13.053
I'm serious.
I'm definitely gonna come visit you.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.846
- I promise.

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:17.391
I know I've been saying it,
but I'm gonna come before you leave.

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:19.559
- For sure.
- All right. I'm gonna hold you to that.

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:21.853
- Wow.
- Done.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.563
When are you coming back?

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:24.940
All night long,
I get that question.

01:06:25.107 --> 01:06:27.025
You know what?
You wanna hear a dirty secret?

01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:29.569
I might never come back.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:35.117
This might be the last time
anybody ever sees Scotty P in Pretzels.

01:06:36.952 --> 01:06:39.329
So you're just gonna leave? You're not
gonna come see your family,

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:41.707
- your parents any more?
- Parents are retiring, man.

01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:45.711
Both of 'em, this year.
So they're contemplating moving over.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:47.462
- Wow.
- What do you need?

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:50.215
That's crazy.
And kind of sad.

01:06:50.382 --> 01:06:52.300
No, no, no.

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:54.594
I love the fact that I got to
come back with Suki.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:57.389
But you know, I loved high school,
I loved college,

01:06:57.556 --> 01:06:59.266
and now I love Japan, man.

01:06:59.433 --> 01:07:01.268
I love everything that I've been able
to do in my life.

01:07:01.435 --> 01:07:03.895
And, you know what? I'm probably
gonna love what I do next, right?

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:05.897
Whatever happens.

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:07.315
So...

01:07:08.316 --> 01:07:09.693
Why spend your time
looking back

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.611
when you've got so much
to look forward to?

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:14.114
You know what I'm saying?
Crazy, yeah.

01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:17.451
Sad? Pfft.
No. No way.

01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:23.415
- Hello?

01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:26.251
- Uh-oh.
- He's so drunk.

01:07:35.427 --> 01:07:36.887
Oh, shit.

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:39.306
I don't know if we...
do you think we've done enough?

01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:42.100
My arm's so sore.

01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:07.959
We should take a picture of it.

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:09.961
- It's gorgeous.
- It's a winter wonderland.

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:11.463
I know.

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:13.215
Shh.

01:08:15.509 --> 01:08:17.676
Shit. Shit.

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:22.557
Beep boop boop.

01:08:24.518 --> 01:08:26.478
Musical break, four measures.
Shots!

01:08:28.814 --> 01:08:31.774
Oh, my God.

01:08:38.073 --> 01:08:40.075
Marty?

01:08:40.242 --> 01:08:42.243
- Is that you?
- No.

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:47.666
Hey. Sorry.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:49.376
- Hey.
- AJ.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.795
What the fu...

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:56.091
- Oh, my God.
- Yay.

01:09:11.523 --> 01:09:13.692
Would you just... I have to...

01:09:15.861 --> 01:09:17.863
I have to... get off.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:19.990
Get off me.

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:25.871
One more.
I wanna do another one.

01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:29.166
I'm doing it.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.966
I'm actually
allergic to pretzels, so...

01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:40.594
- So...
- Being here is really dangerous for me.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.636
So your tongue is swelling up?

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:44.471
- No, I have...
- That's important information.

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:45.890
Reeves, they have your song.

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:47.975
- Reeves!
- What's up?

01:09:48.143 --> 01:09:50.437
They have "Never Had."
They have "Never Had"!

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:54.649
Oh, Jesus.

01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:56.902
They have your song
in the karaoke machine.

01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:58.737
I want you to sing it.

01:09:58.904 --> 01:10:00.030
- Really? You're gonna do this...
- I would love it...

01:10:00.197 --> 01:10:02.240
I actually would love it
if you sang the song.

01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:04.951
Everybody, Reeves.
Who wants Reeves to sing the song?

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:08.955
Reeves!

01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:11.166
- You're gonna make me do this?
- I'm not gonna make you do it.

01:10:11.333 --> 01:10:12.834
I would really love it if you did.

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:15.170
- You're singing it.
- Come on.

01:10:15.337 --> 01:10:16.588
You should've lied.
You should've said that you heard it

01:10:16.755 --> 01:10:17.923
and that you liked it a lot.

01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:19.758
I probably should have.

01:10:19.925 --> 01:10:21.843
You definitely should have
'cause then I wouldn't have to do this.

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:23.845
Yeah!

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.481
Get up there,
Ricky Martin. Let's go.

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:36.441
- Jesus.

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:39.611
Give a hand to Cully,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:39.778 --> 01:10:42.447
That's a big act to follow.

01:10:42.614 --> 01:10:44.074
That's right.

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:55.293
Never karaoke'd myself before.
This is very weird.

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:03.677
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna stop.

01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:07.180
Sorry, I...
Jerry, do you have a guitar?

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:09.557
- You got a guitar back there?
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:10.976
- You want that?
- Yeah, bring it out.

01:11:11.142 --> 01:11:13.144
- Let's do it.
- All right. Let's do this right.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:14.771
- I'm gonna sing.

01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:32.706
Check, check.

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:39.546
Okay.

01:11:39.713 --> 01:11:41.506
Here we go, guys.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.469
If you guys wanna sing along...

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:01.664
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:22.310
That's for you, Mary!

01:15:22.477 --> 01:15:25.104
Yeah! Shots!

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:32.987
- So that's your big hit song?
- That's my big hit song.

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:40.912
I didn't know you remembered
anything about me,

01:15:41.079 --> 01:15:43.456
let alone could write
a song about me.

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:45.708
Really?

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:51.673
Well, there was that...
moment in the parking lot.

01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:54.008
- The parking lot, yeah.
- After that basketball game.

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:55.843
Yeah, there was that moment.

01:15:56.928 --> 01:15:59.472
I got scared.
I had my boyfriend.

01:15:59.639 --> 01:16:01.849
Boyfriend in Austin.

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:04.018
Now you have
a boyfriend in Chicago.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.771
Yeah.

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:18.575
I should go.

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:22.495
Getting scared again?

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:24.747
- Little bit.
- I'll walk you out.

01:16:29.419 --> 01:16:31.087
Hey, Anna.
Should we wait outside?

01:16:40.847 --> 01:16:43.099
You guys are 28 years old.
Do you remember that?

01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:46.436
Sorry.

01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:49.105
Is that what you do in New York now?
Wrap people's houses?

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:50.815
- No.
- Is that how you roll now, Marty?

01:16:50.982 --> 01:16:52.984
- I don't...
- I know this is hard to believe,

01:16:53.151 --> 01:16:56.321
but a couple of hours ago,
it seemed like a great idea.

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:57.822
It did. I was there.
It really...

01:16:57.989 --> 01:16:59.282
You guys are gonna
clean all this up.

01:16:59.449 --> 01:17:00.700
- Of course, yeah.
- All of it.

01:17:00.867 --> 01:17:03.119
Absolutely. Every ply.
Every last little...

01:17:03.286 --> 01:17:04.787
- We should probably...
- We could start now.

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:07.248
'Cause we got plenty of time
before our flight.

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:10.335
Well, come in.
You're letting all the cold air in.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:12.420
Are you sure? We...

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:16.633
- Thank you.
- So sorry again.

01:17:18.343 --> 01:17:20.845
So, does your mom still live here?

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:24.515
I hope we didn't wake her up.
We tried to be quiet.

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:26.643
- She's a deep sleeper.
- Okay.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.102
Cool.

01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:32.482
- It's nice... it's cool you're still...
- Mommy, you awake?

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:35.860
Oh.
Was that a...

01:17:39.781 --> 01:17:42.158
Last call, people.
Last call.

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:45.536
One more drink
and then the party is over.

01:17:45.703 --> 01:17:47.288
Peter, what do you want?
Last customer.

01:17:47.455 --> 01:17:50.249
- Vodka cranberry.
- Yeah.

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:58.675
- You have fun tonight?
- Yeah, it was pretty good.

01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:02.929
Yeah, it was fine.

01:18:06.974 --> 01:18:09.477
- Scotty?
- Yeah, baby.

01:18:09.644 --> 01:18:11.562
Look who's ready to have fun.

01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:13.398
- Shots.
- Shots.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:15.400
Shots. Three shots.

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:17.568
- Let's do it.
- You, me, Jerry. Let's do it.

01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:21.489
Barkeep, Jerry,
let's go for it.

01:18:21.656 --> 01:18:23.908
- You're driving.
- Who says I'm driving?

01:18:27.412 --> 01:18:29.622
You want me to drive?
All right.

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:33.584
Unbelievable.

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:36.421
You're not the only one that
can get drunk, you know?

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:38.756
Maybe there are some other people
at the bar

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:41.426
that would like to throw back
some drinks and, you know,

01:18:41.592 --> 01:18:44.637
act like an asshole
and sing bad karaoke.

01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:49.142
You thought my karaoke was bad?

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:51.519
Porter, come on, man. Are you
gonna take these shots with me or what?

01:18:52.854 --> 01:18:54.856
So here's to you.

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:57.817
To my husband and your great night
and to us being the same age.

01:18:57.984 --> 01:18:59.110
Cheers.

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:03.698
Oh, my God.

01:19:04.699 --> 01:19:06.117
You Okay?

01:19:07.118 --> 01:19:08.369
What was that?

01:19:08.536 --> 01:19:10.580
- It's whiskey. You want another one?
- No.

01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:16.043
Like you said, here's to me.

01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:20.173
Sorry, Sam.

01:19:24.719 --> 01:19:27.430
So much for that being fun,
huh, Jerry?

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:32.393
Peter?

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.228
We gotta talk.

01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:35.938
Come here, dude.

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:38.983
Come on.
We're buddies now.

01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:41.527
- Oh, my God.
- I'm not a douche any more.

01:19:45.782 --> 01:19:48.242
Well, I guess that's...

01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:50.495
that's probably time.

01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:51.913
Yeah.

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:54.499
I think that's it.

01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:00.338
Are you good?

01:20:00.505 --> 01:20:02.006
Are you good to get home?

01:20:02.173 --> 01:20:03.925
Yeah. Sober.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.178
You?

01:20:07.345 --> 01:20:09.430
Uh, yeah.
I'm gonna figure it out.

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:12.642
Okay.

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:19.357
Come on, I'll walk you out.

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.443
Um...

01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:24.195
I'm right behind you.

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:27.323
Okay.

01:20:33.913 --> 01:20:36.707
- Hey, Jake?
- Yeah?

01:20:39.919 --> 01:20:41.921
I think you owe me a dance.

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:50.221
Prom king.

01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:55.393
I owe you a dance?
Really?

01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:58.563
I want to dance.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.486
- Mommy?
- I'll be right there, sweetie.

01:21:05.653 --> 01:21:07.280
Okay.

01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:19.250
Hey... I didn't even know
you had a child.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:24.338
Or children.

01:21:24.505 --> 01:21:28.718
I know.
It's because I didn't tell you.

01:21:30.344 --> 01:21:32.096
You want some milk?

01:21:32.263 --> 01:21:33.931
You want some milk, baby?

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:36.642
- I know, I know.

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:41.856
So you have just the two little

01:21:42.023 --> 01:21:44.650
whippersnappers or...

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.279
We should...

01:21:48.446 --> 01:21:49.780
Hey, I think...

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:53.784
- Urn, where's-
- We're so sorry, Anna.

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:56.913
- So where's the dad, or is he...
- Marty.

01:21:58.497 --> 01:21:59.707
Which one?

01:21:59.874 --> 01:22:01.792
Which one do you
want to know about, Marty?

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:04.253
The dad who made...
who helped you make...

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:05.922
Shh.
That's not...

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:08.549
Are they two separate guys?

01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:10.134
Yeah, Jack's dad, we met...

01:22:10.301 --> 01:22:12.887
I was cocktail waitressing
at a bar in college

01:22:13.054 --> 01:22:15.014
and he moved to...

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:20.394
Atlanta, I think.
Yeah.

01:22:20.561 --> 01:22:23.189
And, well, Molly's dad...

01:22:25.066 --> 01:22:27.068
I don't even know
where to start.

01:22:28.486 --> 01:22:29.820
- You don't have to...
- Look...

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:32.990
this wasn't the plan.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:37.954
I know you guys moved off
and became really successful.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:42.416
And you're staring at me...
looking at me like...

01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:45.211
But...

01:22:47.755 --> 01:22:49.382
I mean, I...

01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:53.386
those pictures of me
in high school.

01:22:53.552 --> 01:22:55.846
I... and, no.

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:59.976
It's what you said,
about that glow.

01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:05.523
I had it.

01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:09.151
And I miss it.

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:14.073
And I just thought
for like, one night,

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.951
I could give it a fucking...

01:23:17.118 --> 01:23:18.703
And then you guys come
and you ruin it.

01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:21.247
You completely fucked it up.

01:23:33.384 --> 01:23:35.386
I have a single bed.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:39.557
I just have a little single bed.
A tiny little bed.

01:23:40.558 --> 01:23:44.145
I have a 200-square-foot apartment
because New York is so expensive,

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:45.730
I can't afford anything more.

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:47.398
I don't even have a separate room
for my toilet.

01:23:47.565 --> 01:23:49.316
It's just all in one room.

01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:52.361
And I wanted to get a double bed,
but then I wouldn't have had room

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:54.905
for a partition around the toilet.
It would have just been

01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:56.574
a bed and a toilet,

01:23:56.741 --> 01:24:00.286
and then the living room
and the kitchen is all the same,

01:24:00.453 --> 01:24:02.955
so I'd literally be shitting
where I eat.

01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:05.916
So, you know?

01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:08.169
I...

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:09.587
My wife's leaving me.

01:24:09.754 --> 01:24:12.256
- What?
- What?

01:24:12.423 --> 01:24:13.758
Mm.

01:24:14.759 --> 01:24:16.427
Are you serious?

01:24:16.594 --> 01:24:19.430
Yeah, I keep screwing up
and she's getting sick of it.

01:24:19.597 --> 01:24:21.432
Or she keeps screwing up
and I'm getting sick of it.

01:24:21.599 --> 01:24:25.561
- It's...
- Why wouldn't you tell me that?

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.732
There hasn't been a right time.

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:32.526
What do you mean, the right time?
Are you kidding?

01:24:32.693 --> 01:24:34.278
I was best man at your wedding.

01:24:34.445 --> 01:24:36.572
Who else are you
gonna talk to about it?

01:24:36.739 --> 01:24:40.659
No one. No one.
No, I'm saying we all have messes.

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:42.495
It's...

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:44.455
We all have messes.

01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:49.502
I have a tiny bed,
you guys have... it's all relative.

01:24:51.545 --> 01:24:53.130
- Oh.

01:24:56.842 --> 01:24:59.637
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, big guy.

01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:01.764
- Mommy?
- Yeah?

01:25:01.931 --> 01:25:02.973
I'm hungry.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.975
Okay, sweetheart.

01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:07.394
- Let me see what...
- You're hungry? I'm also hungry.

01:25:07.561 --> 01:25:11.065
Oh, this is... I'm the mayor of
Hungrytown right now.

01:25:11.232 --> 01:25:13.692
We're a bunch of
hungry, hungry hippos.

01:25:13.859 --> 01:25:16.362
Hungry hippos here.
So we're with you.

01:25:16.529 --> 01:25:18.823
We're totally with you, big man.

01:25:19.824 --> 01:25:21.200
Big night.

01:25:21.367 --> 01:25:22.368
Big night for Jules.

01:25:22.535 --> 01:25:23.911
- I need French fries.
- Yeah, you do.

01:25:24.078 --> 01:25:26.080
- Like, now.
- All kinds of French fries.

01:25:26.247 --> 01:25:28.207
We need to go eat.
I'm starving.

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:30.876
Is anything open?

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:33.045
- Night, guys.
- Night, Sam.

01:25:41.345 --> 01:25:43.931
Hey.
Let's go.

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:46.809
Wake up.

01:25:48.519 --> 01:25:51.689
Hey.
You Okay?

01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:54.400
No.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.115
Let's go.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:06.036
Come on.
You gotta stand up.

01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:08.706
- Can you stand up?
- No.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:12.877
Come here, come here.

01:26:20.968 --> 01:26:22.761
Think you're gonna
remember this tomorrow?

01:26:23.929 --> 01:26:25.181
Nope.

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:27.933
Okay. Let's get you
cleaned up, then.

01:26:50.039 --> 01:26:52.249
- Another parking lot.
- Yeah.

01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:56.503
Another parking lot.

01:26:58.756 --> 01:27:00.466
So, hey.
Where do you live?

01:27:00.633 --> 01:27:03.052
'Cause I don't think I know
where you actually live.

01:27:03.219 --> 01:27:05.095
I don't really live anywhere.

01:27:05.262 --> 01:27:07.473
I live out of a suitcase.

01:27:11.685 --> 01:27:13.520
Do you come back here often?

01:27:13.687 --> 01:27:16.941
No.
Almost never.

01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:22.947
Well, I'll just give you
my number.

01:27:23.113 --> 01:27:25.074
In case.

01:27:26.492 --> 01:27:28.244
In case you ever do come back.

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:33.123
You could call me,
if you felt like it.

01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:44.301
And doing that
would be a bad idea.

01:27:46.345 --> 01:27:48.681
Why?

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:54.061
You're never here.
You're always on the road.

01:27:54.228 --> 01:27:56.021
Right?

01:27:58.607 --> 01:28:00.943
I'm here now.

01:28:21.672 --> 01:28:23.173
So, Jess...

01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:27.803
Yes?

01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:34.143
You're gonna marry her,
aren't you?

01:28:36.395 --> 01:28:38.022
Mmmmm.

01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:45.738
What the hell
are you waiting for?

01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:47.156
Hmm?

01:28:47.323 --> 01:28:49.116
I don't know.

01:28:51.035 --> 01:28:53.704
She's just perfect
and I need it to be perfect.

01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:58.876
Then ask her.

01:28:59.877 --> 01:29:01.920
And it will be.

01:29:05.591 --> 01:29:06.759
I don't wanna leave.

01:29:06.925 --> 01:29:08.719
I know you don't,
but I'm taking you home.

01:29:08.886 --> 01:29:10.083
I feel like I don't even
know you any more.

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.181
- Stop it.
- I don't.

01:29:12.348 --> 01:29:14.183
What are you talking about?

01:29:15.476 --> 01:29:18.312
I have always wondered what it'd be like
to sleep with a black guy.

01:29:18.479 --> 01:29:19.646
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:21.565
Well, it's too bad
you're married to me, then, huh?

01:29:22.566 --> 01:29:24.234
- Babe.
- What?

01:29:24.401 --> 01:29:26.862
I'm the same guy you woke up
next to this morning.

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:28.906
Just with more skills.

01:29:29.073 --> 01:29:31.658
Right, more skills.
Exactly.

01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:34.161
I have skills
you don't even know about,

01:29:34.328 --> 01:29:37.456
so you don't even know that.

01:30:07.111 --> 01:30:09.446
I'm glad we found
a better use for these eggs.

01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:11.740
Yeah.

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:13.033
- Playing the piano.
- Right here.

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.284
She's gonna be a musician.

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:15.786
Do you guys want more?

01:30:15.953 --> 01:30:17.704
- No, I think we're good.
- Oh, no. They're so good.

01:30:17.871 --> 01:30:19.957
They're amazing.

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:47.192
Marty.

01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:48.944
What'd you say now?

01:30:50.487 --> 01:30:53.490
He said he thinks I'm glowing
more than ever now.

01:30:58.495 --> 01:31:00.706
- Yeah, yeah.

01:31:00.873 --> 01:31:02.708
- You're great.
- Yeah.

01:31:04.084 --> 01:31:05.544
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:31:05.711 --> 01:31:07.254
Yeah.

01:31:07.421 --> 01:31:08.672
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:08.839 --> 01:31:10.841
- What about you?
- What?

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:14.052
Are you happy?

01:31:15.095 --> 01:31:17.848
I know you're all married
and everything now.

01:31:18.015 --> 01:31:20.684
Yep.

01:31:20.851 --> 01:31:22.728
You happy with Paul?

01:31:29.568 --> 01:31:30.694
Not this again, really?

01:31:30.861 --> 01:31:32.779
Okay, okay.
Yes, I pinky swear.

01:31:32.946 --> 01:31:34.490
I pinky swear.

01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:40.287
I haven't told anyone.

01:31:42.706 --> 01:31:44.500
- I'm pregnant.
- You're pregnant.

01:31:46.168 --> 01:31:48.170
I'm such an idiot.
I should've... with the water.

01:31:48.337 --> 01:31:50.214
Oh, my God.
How are you so little?

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:52.841
It's 10 weeks, so...

01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:56.220
It's little.

01:31:56.386 --> 01:31:58.347
Oh, my God.
I'm...

01:31:58.514 --> 01:32:00.390
It's a little scary.

01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:02.809
Don't be scared.

01:32:02.976 --> 01:32:04.394
You hear me?
Do not be scared.

01:32:04.561 --> 01:32:08.065
You are going to be
just like your dad.

01:32:08.232 --> 01:32:11.193
You're gonna be
the absolute best parent

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.529
that anyone could ever ask for.

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:17.866
No, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:20.994
- Oh.

01:32:26.959 --> 01:32:29.419
So you are happy.

01:32:49.481 --> 01:32:50.774
It has a digital readout.

01:32:50.941 --> 01:32:53.694
Oh, that's so unique.
It comes with a battery.

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:57.155
That is so generous.
A one-year warranty.

01:32:57.322 --> 01:32:59.366
Ever since I had a baby,
I have had...

01:32:59.533 --> 01:33:01.743
You waited up for me?

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:03.704
Yeah.

01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:08.500
Thank you.

01:33:08.667 --> 01:33:10.669
For waiting up for you?

01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:13.130
No.

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:17.926
For making me stay.

01:33:21.263 --> 01:33:23.599
I don't know.
I just needed to, like...

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:26.351
I needed to see
that she was okay, whatever.

01:33:26.518 --> 01:33:28.604
I know.

01:33:30.439 --> 01:33:32.274
Yeah.

01:33:33.567 --> 01:33:36.570
I think you know me
better than I know me.

01:33:36.737 --> 01:33:39.072
I think I do, too.

01:33:42.242 --> 01:33:44.453
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.496
What am I thinking right now?

01:33:48.582 --> 01:33:52.169
You're thinking
you want some bacon.

01:33:55.505 --> 01:33:57.299
I'm always thinking of bacon,
<i>so</i> that's not fair.

01:33:58.842 --> 01:34:01.011
No, you're not tickling
your way out of this.

01:34:05.515 --> 01:34:08.226
I caught her staring at him,
like, seven times.

01:34:08.393 --> 01:34:09.603
Oh!

01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:11.480
Wowie wow!

01:34:12.481 --> 01:34:14.566
Oh, my God.
We're so glad you're here.

01:34:14.733 --> 01:34:15.817
- Hey.
- No, we had to come back.

01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:18.862
I'm glad you came back.
What'd you do, you go clubbing?

01:34:19.029 --> 01:34:20.656
- Sit down.
- Good to see you.

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:22.574
- Take a seat, take a seat.
- Hi!

01:34:27.204 --> 01:34:28.205
- We're going to Japan?
- Yes.

01:34:28.372 --> 01:34:29.956
- You're all gonna go to Japan.
- Everybody.

01:34:30.123 --> 01:34:31.291
I'm going to Japan.

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:18.171
I've been asked so many times
today, and they're like...

01:36:09.806 --> 01:36:11.141
Vanillo, I'm serious.
Just come on.

01:36:11.308 --> 01:36:13.226
- I'll try to get everybody.
- No... yeah, right.

01:36:13.393 --> 01:36:14.644
You will get everybody.
Just put it back.

01:36:14.811 --> 01:36:16.354
It's just perfect.
I set it up perfectly.

01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:17.773
- I'll put it back, I'll put it back.
- Okay, thank you.

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:18.940
- After I do this.
- No, Vanillo!

01:36:19.107 --> 01:36:22.277
Hey, Vanillo. Just hanging out
at your reunion. Hi.

01:36:22.444 --> 01:36:24.154
- What are you doing with this?
- I don't know.

01:36:24.321 --> 01:36:25.447
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

01:36:25.614 --> 01:36:27.115
You gotta be filming for a reason.

01:36:27.282 --> 01:36:29.534
- What's this for?
- I don't know.

01:36:29.701 --> 01:36:31.411
It's just for us, realty.
Nobody's gonna see it.

01:36:31.578 --> 01:36:32.954
Who's us?
I don't know who us is.

01:36:33.121 --> 01:36:34.122
So are you having
a good time here?

01:36:34.289 --> 01:36:36.124
Yeah, are you having...
who are you?

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:38.752
- I'm Vanillo. Nick.
- Oh.

01:36:38.919 --> 01:36:41.713
Hi, Vanillo.
How's it going?

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.298
It's good to see you again.

01:36:43.465 --> 01:36:44.466
It's good to see you, buddy.

01:36:44.633 --> 01:36:46.176
- Remember Peter Chang?
- That's really bright.

01:36:46.343 --> 01:36:48.261
- Yeah, I do.
- Jung. It's Peter Jung.

01:36:48.428 --> 01:36:49.429
- It's Jung.
- I know,

01:36:49.596 --> 01:36:51.056
but no one remembers
you by that.

01:36:51.223 --> 01:36:53.391
- Peter Jung, remember?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:36:53.558 --> 01:36:55.227
- I'm putting him in a car.
- Yeah.

01:36:55.393 --> 01:36:56.561
The night is young.

01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:59.314
Would you say
the night is Peter Jung?

01:37:02.984 --> 01:37:04.820
Oh, my God. I spilled.

01:37:04.986 --> 01:37:07.364
The night is Peter Jung.

01:37:07.531 --> 01:37:09.241
You know, the night is Chang.

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:11.493
It's good to be back, see everybody.

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:12.869
See Anna.

01:37:13.036 --> 01:37:14.079
Whoo. What?

01:37:14.246 --> 01:37:15.831
Does your mom have big boobs?

01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:16.998
Whoo, she looks so good.

01:37:17.165 --> 01:37:19.626
She looks really... she almost looks
better than she did in high school.

01:37:19.793 --> 01:37:23.672
She's got a little bit
of late twenties heft.

01:37:23.839 --> 01:37:26.132
Like her body's yearning
to have a baby.

01:37:26.299 --> 01:37:28.760
It's funny seeing Scotty P.

01:37:28.927 --> 01:37:29.970
What is this, smashing?

01:37:30.136 --> 01:37:32.514
- Uh...
- What... what was smashing?

01:37:32.681 --> 01:37:34.724
Yeah, Scott.
What is smashing?

01:37:34.891 --> 01:37:36.518
Really, Nick? Really?

01:37:36.685 --> 01:37:38.937
You know, Kev Garrity...

01:37:39.104 --> 01:37:40.313
you know, G-Money?

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:44.234
We're just smashing
every minute we can get.

01:37:44.401 --> 01:37:47.195
And then, hopefully,
out of the smash session,

01:37:47.362 --> 01:37:50.907
a baby will just smash out of

01:37:51.074 --> 01:37:54.119
him and me and then I'll smash
that baby out of the womb.

01:37:54.286 --> 01:37:55.429
And then my baby
will learn how to smash.

01:37:55.495 --> 01:37:56.496
That's good.

01:37:56.663 --> 01:37:58.582
It's crazy, man.
It's crazy seeing everybody.

01:37:58.748 --> 01:38:00.250
All the stuff that
we used to do together.

01:38:00.417 --> 01:38:02.127
All the chicks we used to run.
What?

01:38:02.294 --> 01:38:03.600
- We should go in the stall.
- Don't tell Jake.

01:38:03.712 --> 01:38:05.005
- Let's go in the stall.
- Don't tell Jake.

01:38:06.715 --> 01:38:09.718
- Everybody in the stall.
- Yeah, everybody in the stall.

01:38:09.885 --> 01:38:12.387
- That's amazing.
- Actually, it's totally changed my...

01:38:12.554 --> 01:38:14.556
I actually never did this
in high school, ever.

01:38:14.723 --> 01:38:16.725
- So this is kind of, like...

01:38:16.892 --> 01:38:19.686
- Oh!

01:38:19.853 --> 01:38:21.077
- I'm Millie... I'm Millie.
- You remixed...

01:38:21.187 --> 01:38:22.188
- Yeah.
- You remixed my song?

01:38:22.355 --> 01:38:24.482
You know, I mean?
I just do music on the side.

01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:27.027
Which songs did you?

01:38:27.193 --> 01:38:28.236
You know what I mean?

01:38:28.403 --> 01:38:29.779
But look how sexy this is.

01:38:29.946 --> 01:38:31.531
Whose boy band picture is this?

01:38:31.698 --> 01:38:33.325
That's Scott.

01:38:33.491 --> 01:38:35.076
- Scott, of course.
- That's Scott.

01:38:40.916 --> 01:38:43.126
- Scott, man.
- That's all I got! That's all I got!

01:38:43.293 --> 01:38:45.545
Well, you are, kinda. 'Cause you
kinda grabbed mine in the bathroom.

01:38:45.712 --> 01:38:47.255
She'd just got 'em.

01:38:47.422 --> 01:38:49.758
Look, I remember you
in tenth grade.

01:38:49.925 --> 01:38:53.678
- Those roses looked like, flat.
- That was junior year.

01:38:53.845 --> 01:38:56.264
And then, in junior and senior year,

01:38:56.431 --> 01:38:57.933
those roses
looked like blossoms.

01:38:58.099 --> 01:38:59.434
Well, I was a late bloomer.

01:38:59.601 --> 01:39:02.020
They're still talking about my boobs.
I'm sorry.

01:39:02.187 --> 01:39:04.606
All right, picture me
as a big old Hershey Kiss.

01:39:04.773 --> 01:39:05.899
Done.

01:39:06.066 --> 01:39:07.442
For a little while.
That's why I just...

01:39:07.609 --> 01:39:09.235
- Excuse us.
- Sorry about that.

01:39:09.402 --> 01:39:10.570
That's your husband?

01:39:10.737 --> 01:39:12.697
- Yes.
- I thought that was your dad.

01:39:15.784 --> 01:39:18.620
So, do you see spending
the rest of your life with Jake?

01:39:18.787 --> 01:39:20.497
I do.

01:39:20.664 --> 01:39:22.958
I definitely do.

01:39:23.124 --> 01:39:24.918
Give me the song,
give me the song, give me the song.

01:39:25.085 --> 01:39:26.211
Yeah.

01:39:30.632 --> 01:39:31.633
Right...

01:40:00.662 --> 01:40:03.248
- You feel me? So it's like...
- Yeah, it keeps going.

01:40:03.415 --> 01:40:05.542
You know what I mean?
So, I put that together,

01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:07.502
I mixed some Biggie in there,

01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:10.005
and it was huge.
Dude, it was huge.

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:17.203
