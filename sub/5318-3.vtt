something from them.

One that will help with

humiliation ahead of you.

playing you like a marionette

like everything else
he's done with.

where Brad is headed?

13:30.394 --> 13:32.851

condemned buildings...

13:32.938 --> 13:35.224

narrow down your search.

on the van?

14:23.071 --> 14:25.107

14:25.949 --> 14:28.361
I've been so busy trying
to configure my computer
to the system

14:28.452 --> 14:31.159
that I completely
forgot to ask Kiera
where she was going.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.369
Oh. She didn't say?

14:34.249 --> 14:35.830
No, she didn't say.

so well together is because
of our trust in each other.

14:50.807 --> 14:51.887
I can't risk losing
that again.

14:51.975 --> 14:55.012
I get it, okay?
Don't think of it as spying.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.805
Kiera's feelings
for Brad have got
her head out of the game.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.356
That's gonna get her
in a very dangerous situation.

that we're there to protect
her when that happens.

trust my discretion.

15:41.858 --> 15:42.893

15:42.984 --> 15:45.396
So these superconducting
magnets got me thinking.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.694
You know
that doohickey that you stole
from Kellog's soldiers?

15:47.864 --> 15:50.981
It is off the scale magnetic
and I think Ijust found
the on switch.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.535
What makes you say that?

15:54.371 --> 15:55.952
You kind of have to see it
to understand it,

15:56.039 --> 15:58.906
but it lines up with one
mother of a magnetic field.

15:59.376 --> 16:02.368

the precinct and it runs
straight into a vacant factory

with an abandoned factory?

wanted it for something.

what that something is.

and meet me at your place

of there and meet me.

No, thanks.

Ijust want to know why
you published my manifesto.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.302

17:52.739 --> 17:55.651
I haven't found a single
work order or city permit
for this location.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.990
But I hacked
a nearby traffic cam.

17:58.078 --> 18:01.115
You see Piron trucks
bringing in materials

18:01.498 --> 18:02.863

open for any surprises.

in the sky from here?

18:13.510 --> 18:14.716

get what we want,

we'll get out and meet back
here to debrief and devise
any follow-up actions.

more than you think.

that in 20 years

and you will lose.

And how do you know that?

19:37.594 --> 19:38.879

why I can't let that manifesto

He's standing by the
north side of the building.

28:25.997 --> 28:27.282

28:27.832 --> 28:29.697
Okay, got it.

28:30.710 --> 28:31.699
Oh, shit.

28:31.794 --> 28:34.456

have found the one
we already took out. Garza?

(ALARM BLARING)

28:38.634 --> 28:39.794
What happened?

28:40.511 --> 28:41.921
There are two of them.

28:42.847 --> 28:44.178
Both in cloaking tech.

28:44.849 --> 28:48.307
You know, I don't know
what your game is, Tonkin,
but it's falling apart.

28:48.895 --> 28:49.930
There's no game.

28:50.021 --> 28:51.602
All evidence
to the contrary.

28:51.689 --> 28:54.305
Enough.
We'll finish this conversation
after we secure the perimeter.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.441
Prove him wrong.
Nobody leaves the building.
You two stay with the others.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.143
Protect the site.

29:02.033 --> 29:03.898
Garza? Wake up.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.403
What happened?

29:05.494 --> 29:07.450
We've gotta
get out of here now,
just trust me. Up.

29:35.524 --> 29:38.687
Alec, they've disabled
our tech. We need
another way out, now!

29:38.945 --> 29:40.856
You're at a dead end.
The only way out
is through them.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.855
Lucas, they're trapped.
They may not make
it out without your help.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.904
That's gonna be
a little tricky.

29:49.038 --> 29:50.027
Out of the van!

29:50.498 --> 29:51.908
Look, ifyou don't
get in there, they die.

He killed Lucas.

It's your fault, Kiera.
Don't you dare.

We had them kneecapped
and you chickened out.
It's your fault.

32:22.691 --> 32:23.771
I couldn't let you blow it up.

who killed Lucas?

to do with Brad,
don't you see?

you're the only one
who wants to go back.

are aware but moving this site

That means we work

push Kellog to provide us
with additional security.

the police show up, but when.

That falls on his head.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.513
He's a goddamn liability.

33:42.646 --> 33:43.761
He took out one of theirs.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.053
That should count
for something.

for this mission and
I'm going to see it through.

Yeah, you are.
Will you two act like
professionals?

33:57.286 --> 33:58.696
Is this what you wanted?

34:02.541 --> 34:03.917
No.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.958
This isn't what Marcellus
would have wanted.

34:09.173 --> 34:10.458

forward has accelerated.

without my say so.

that key, Tonkin.

It's not your fault

I told him you needed help.

34:49.672 --> 34:52.004
It's more complicated
than that. You know it.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.547
What's more complicated?

34:57.972 --> 34:59.337
Did you get a lead
on that black van?

34:59.431 --> 35:00.716
Dead end.

35:02.309 --> 35:03.970

you guys all day?

35:04.311 --> 35:06.597

hit the same dead end.

some more components
for the system.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.488

not who you think he is.

35:25.582 --> 35:26.571
So why are you protecting him?

35:26.709 --> 35:27.915
I'm not protecting him.

35:28.043 --> 35:29.374
Why are we lying to Carlos?

35:29.837 --> 35:32.624

that site until we know more.

about the antimatter

about you, then?

and his plans?

Whatever he's up to...

35:41.724 --> 35:45.763

what I want and Kellog
gets what he deserves.

the endgame was sure to be.

to give his life
for the cause.

be an easy one, Protector.

36:57.466 --> 36:58.751

36:59.551 --> 37:02.668
It's getting harder
and harder to...

37:04.223 --> 37:05.804
Choose which path to take.

37:07.810 --> 37:09.801
Which decisions
are the right ones.

by everyone without

This truth.

than any of us.

Greed is his drug
and his weakness.

stop him at all costs.
