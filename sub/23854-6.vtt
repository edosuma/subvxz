00:22.562 --> 00:24.542
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

00:24.542 --> 00:26.578
It's the last show of the series,
and I got

00:26.578 --> 00:29.598
to tell you, we are going out in
a blaze of glory.

00:29.598 --> 00:32.566
We're really turning up the heat,
we are smoking.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.582
Basically, what I'm saying is there
is a film coming up where something

00:35.582 --> 00:36.606
catches fire.

00:36.606 --> 00:38.558
But first, SUVs.

00:38.558 --> 00:41.570
Now, the last few years have seen a
whole bunch of sports car makers

00:41.570 --> 00:45.586
building them, but there's one
manufacturer that's nobly resisted,

00:45.586 --> 00:48.598
stood alone and refused to budge.

00:48.598 --> 00:49.602
Until now.

00:56.594 --> 00:59.574
This is the Stelvio.

00:59.574 --> 01:03.578
It's got five seats,
it's got four-wheel drive,

01:03.578 --> 01:06.626
it starts at just over £30,000,

01:06.626 --> 01:10.554
and it comes from Alfa Romeo.

01:10.554 --> 01:13.582
Yes, Alfa have done an SUV.

01:16.582 --> 01:18.562
And they've done it right.

01:18.562 --> 01:20.618
This is what a sports utility
vehicle should be.

01:24.566 --> 01:28.574
The Stelvio's made of aluminium and
carbon fibre, so it's light,

01:28.574 --> 01:32.554
and it's quick, too. This one's got
a two-litre petrol turbo that makes

01:32.554 --> 01:33.602
280 horsepower.

01:36.534 --> 01:39.590
It'll get to 60mph quicker than a
Golf GTi.

01:39.590 --> 01:40.594
This thing hauls.

01:44.554 --> 01:45.566
HE CHUCKLES

01:50.558 --> 01:51.586
The steering's quick,

01:51.586 --> 01:54.610
you sit nice and low, and you can
really throw it into a corner.

01:59.586 --> 02:02.610
And while it does have
SUV-essential four-wheel drive,

02:02.610 --> 02:07.614
most of the time the power
gets sent to the rear wheels.

02:07.614 --> 02:09.538
You know, the fun wheels.

02:14.578 --> 02:17.598
So it's a sports utility vehicle
with plenty of sport,

02:17.598 --> 02:19.562
and plenty of utility, too.

02:19.562 --> 02:21.574
Loads of room for five people,

02:21.574 --> 02:25.598
and Alfa says that boot will hold
525 litres of water.

02:25.598 --> 02:27.610
Heck, you could transport a
medium-sized dolphin

02:27.610 --> 02:29.546
back there, easy.

02:31.626 --> 02:33.530
And this dash...

02:34.550 --> 02:36.554
..as you can see, it's still
attached to the car.

02:38.538 --> 02:40.606
The switchgear, it works.

02:40.606 --> 02:44.598
This, this is a bold new approach
for Alfa.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.602
I like it.

02:49.554 --> 02:54.546
You know, there was a time if you
wanted THAT badge in your life,

02:54.546 --> 02:56.614
you had to accept certain
compromises.

02:58.562 --> 03:00.574
Specifically, that it would be
attached

03:00.574 --> 03:04.546
to a totally impractical car that
didn't work most of the time.

03:04.546 --> 03:06.530
But not the Stelvio.

03:06.530 --> 03:09.562
It checks all the rational,
practical boxes,

03:09.562 --> 03:11.542
and it's an Alfa Romeo,

03:11.542 --> 03:12.578
what...

03:12.578 --> 03:13.582
What's not to love?

03:20.566 --> 03:22.602
Pointless and self-defeating.

03:22.602 --> 03:24.554
- Excuse me. - Mm-hm?

03:24.554 --> 03:27.562
Thanks for butting into my film,
and why is it pointless?

03:27.562 --> 03:29.602
Um, it's a sporty SUV, Matthew.

03:29.602 --> 03:32.534
Sporty SUVs are inherently
pointless,

03:32.534 --> 03:34.602
they're trying to join together two
things that don't join.

03:34.602 --> 03:37.586
OK, your argument would be much
stronger if you didn't just pull up

03:37.586 --> 03:39.566
in an SUV.

03:39.566 --> 03:42.554
Noted, obviously, if you need a big,
practical family set of wheels,

03:42.554 --> 03:45.614
you should buy an estate car, but it
seems some people must have an SUV,

03:45.614 --> 03:50.626
and if so, I give you the
Volvo XC60, a practical, family,

03:50.626 --> 03:53.570
countryside thing from people who
have been doing

03:53.570 --> 03:56.538
practical, family, countryside
things for generations.

03:56.538 --> 03:58.602
Come on, let's go for a drive,
I'll show you what it's all about.

03:58.602 --> 04:02.582
- Come on, follow me. - But I was just
about to do the big finale thing.

04:02.582 --> 04:05.622
I had a big musical ending, there
was going to be a wind machine,

04:05.622 --> 04:08.574
it was going to be very emotional,
Chris!

04:08.574 --> 04:09.578
Come on.

04:09.578 --> 04:10.606
CELLO PLAYS

04:13.546 --> 04:15.602
It's not fair, it's just not fair
at all.

04:29.550 --> 04:31.606
Volvo's been having a bit of a
resurgence recently,

04:31.606 --> 04:35.534
and it's been doing it by being
really chilled out.

04:36.566 --> 04:39.618
While every other carmaker on
the planet gets sportier and more

04:39.618 --> 04:44.574
aggressive, Volvo says, relax,
kick back, have a fennel tea.

04:46.602 --> 04:50.606
And on the inside you know exactly
what you're getting.

04:50.606 --> 04:52.590
I mean, these seats are comfortable.

04:52.590 --> 04:55.626
Volvo basically invented
comfortable seating,

04:55.626 --> 04:59.566
and all the interfaces and the
screens, not only do they look good,

04:59.566 --> 05:00.610
but they make total sense.

05:00.610 --> 05:02.614
It's intuitive, and you know what,

05:02.614 --> 05:07.534
the XC60 is really pleasant to
drive fast.

05:07.534 --> 05:10.558
It's tight in the corners, it stays
flat,

05:10.558 --> 05:12.626
but the best thing of all is this
isn't an SUV

05:12.626 --> 05:14.606
pretending to be a sports car.

05:16.614 --> 05:17.622
It's just a Volvo.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.558
Hey, Chris, where are we going,
anyway?

05:23.558 --> 05:25.606
We're going to a house that's
significantly older than

05:25.606 --> 05:26.610
your country.

05:28.570 --> 05:30.606
Where we were going was to the
Burghley Estate.

05:36.530 --> 05:38.602
Its magnificent sprawling
grounds are home

05:38.602 --> 05:41.610
to the prestigious
Burghley Horse Trials, which,

05:41.610 --> 05:43.622
to the less equestrian minded,

05:43.622 --> 05:46.594
is a sort of horsey sports day.

05:53.594 --> 05:55.598
Look at this.

05:55.598 --> 05:58.626
This is the spiritual home of
the SUV,

05:58.626 --> 06:01.566
these are the people that buy
these kind of cars, Matt.

06:01.566 --> 06:03.594
I mean, look around you. Volvo,
Land Rover,

06:03.594 --> 06:06.542
Volvo, Volvo, Land Rover,

06:06.542 --> 06:09.538
the odd Volkswagen. I mean, the
British population can't be wrong.

06:09.538 --> 06:11.622
That's what I'm saying, you know,
you buy a Volvo,

06:11.622 --> 06:15.530
you buy a Land Rover,
you're just one of the sheep.

06:15.530 --> 06:18.574
You show up here in this,
you're the guy in the Alfa.

06:18.574 --> 06:22.538
No, you're the guy in the Alfa SUV,
it's just wrong!

06:22.538 --> 06:23.606
Why shouldn't Alfa make an SUV?

06:23.606 --> 06:27.550
Everyone else is making them
nowadays - Jaguar, Bentley,

06:27.550 --> 06:29.606
Maserati, Porsche has got two
of them,

06:29.606 --> 06:32.534
and for £30,000, you can't argue.

06:32.534 --> 06:34.618
They start at 30,000, how much is
that one there?

06:34.618 --> 06:37.538
- How much is this car?
- The one you're driving, Matthew,

06:37.538 --> 06:40.558
- how much is that one?
- It's like 47,000...

06:40.558 --> 06:41.598
£47,000?!

06:41.598 --> 06:43.602
- Is it?! - That's absurd.

06:43.602 --> 06:45.578
Well, how much is yours?

06:45.578 --> 06:47.598
This is a very, very highly
specified example...

06:47.598 --> 06:49.606
How much is that one, how much?

06:49.606 --> 06:51.586
- 53,000... - 53,000...

06:51.586 --> 06:53.546
MUFFLED MUSIC THUDS

06:53.546 --> 06:54.598
What's that noise?

06:57.570 --> 06:58.574
Rory?

06:59.578 --> 07:00.590
Rory.

07:02.574 --> 07:03.578
MUSIC STOPS

07:05.538 --> 07:06.542
Oi-oi!

07:07.570 --> 07:08.582
What's up, gangsters?

07:10.550 --> 07:14.594
Hi, welcome to my film, come on in,
the more, the merrier.

07:14.594 --> 07:18.534
- What is that?
- This is the new Range Rover Velar.

07:19.586 --> 07:23.530
The latest offering from the
ultimate SUV brand.

07:23.530 --> 07:26.570
It's powered by a rugged
two-litre diesel,

07:26.570 --> 07:28.622
packing a tidy 237 horsepower.

07:28.622 --> 07:32.558
All dressed up with the style
conscious driver in mind.

07:32.558 --> 07:37.538
This is what SUVs are really all
about, I mean, this is a statement.

07:37.538 --> 07:39.542
It, er, it is that.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.618
It does the family stuff, it does
the off-roading stuff, I mean,

07:41.618 --> 07:45.542
it is a Range Rover, but image,
image, Matt,

07:45.542 --> 07:47.538
that's why you buy an SUV.

07:47.538 --> 07:49.538
You want a car that says something
about you.

07:49.538 --> 07:50.626
That says, um, I want to be
a rapper,

07:50.626 --> 07:52.626
but I'm stuck in middle management,

07:52.626 --> 07:55.562
- that's what it says, Rory.
- And what are you wearing?

07:56.570 --> 07:58.590
Image! Presence.

07:59.614 --> 08:01.530
Leave me alone.

08:03.570 --> 08:04.594
Don't touch.

08:04.594 --> 08:05.598
I'm happy with that.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.534
And I can't remember what that one
says.

08:09.534 --> 08:10.594
Kick me!

08:10.594 --> 08:11.618
Is that what it says?

08:11.618 --> 08:13.618
Can we talk about how great my
car is?

08:13.618 --> 08:16.550
All right, how much does that cost?

08:16.550 --> 08:17.610
67 and a half.

08:20.562 --> 08:23.594
Well, listen, no, it, it costs money
because you get what you pay for,

08:23.594 --> 08:25.594
- this is value.
- Wrong decision, here we go.

08:25.594 --> 08:27.598
- Watch yourself.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

08:29.534 --> 08:31.622
Hello there.
It's a challenge, thank you!

08:34.602 --> 08:35.606
What does it say?

08:36.618 --> 08:41.610
OK, to decide which of you has
brought the best SUV - me -

08:41.610 --> 08:44.550
you and your cars will now
compete in

08:44.550 --> 08:46.590
Top Gear's inaugural horse trials.

08:46.590 --> 08:48.530
What?

08:48.530 --> 08:49.594
Horse trials!

08:49.594 --> 08:51.542
Saddle up, boys!

08:51.542 --> 08:52.602
- Come on. - I ain't trying no horse.

08:52.602 --> 08:53.606
CHRIS GROANS

09:00.530 --> 09:02.570
That's right. Horse trials.

09:02.570 --> 09:05.554
The ultimate test of horse
and rider.

09:05.554 --> 09:08.614
Or, in our case, car and driver.

09:08.614 --> 09:11.614
Our competition would consist of
two rounds,

09:11.614 --> 09:15.546
and for the first we were told to
head to the arena.

09:18.542 --> 09:19.554
This is great!

09:19.554 --> 09:22.618
This is a classical British scene,
the village gymkhana.

09:22.618 --> 09:24.590
- I love it. - Yeah.

09:24.590 --> 09:27.570
So we're meant to do the horse
things, but in the cars...

09:29.530 --> 09:33.570
And our first "horse thing" would be
a timed run through

09:33.570 --> 09:34.574
the arena's obstacles.

09:35.610 --> 09:41.562
Including a seesaw, rumble strips,
two jumps and a bridge,

09:41.562 --> 09:44.538
before finishing in the enclosure.

09:44.538 --> 09:47.626
And to make our equine SUV test
even more thorough,

09:47.626 --> 09:50.530
we'd been given something to tow.

09:50.530 --> 09:52.582
- Horse trailer. - Horse box.

09:52.582 --> 09:55.594
- Excuse me? - We call it a horse box.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.614
You call that trailer a horse box?

09:57.614 --> 09:58.618
We do.

10:00.530 --> 10:02.618
- That sounds like a horse's... - We're
not going there, are we, Matthew?

10:02.618 --> 10:04.538
- Come on. - OK.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.626
Please tell me there's not an actual
horse in there, though.

10:06.626 --> 10:08.530
Let's find out.

10:09.546 --> 10:11.558
Hey! Geez.

10:11.558 --> 10:13.578
Just trying to help there, sorry.
After you, Rory.

10:13.578 --> 10:14.582
Thanks.

10:15.590 --> 10:16.594
Pillock.

10:17.606 --> 10:22.614
Thankfully, we'd been given cargo
capable of taking a knock or two.

10:22.614 --> 10:23.618
What is that?

10:25.614 --> 10:27.618
A horse pinata.

10:27.618 --> 10:29.550
- Oh, OK. - Very humane.

10:30.618 --> 10:33.530
- This is where you don't want to
stand. - Yep.

10:34.570 --> 10:36.554
OK, who's going to go first?

10:36.554 --> 10:39.546
- Me? - I'll go first. - Yeah, I'll go
first, yeah, it's my film.

10:40.606 --> 10:42.610
- Touchy. - I think he's quite sensitive
about this.

10:47.534 --> 10:48.622
OK, here we go.

10:48.622 --> 10:51.590
Three, two, one.

10:51.590 --> 10:52.594
KLAXON BLARES

10:53.602 --> 10:54.606
He's away.

10:57.534 --> 10:58.610
Hitching up now.

10:58.610 --> 11:01.570
- It's accurate, it's good, it's good,
it's good. - Oh!

11:03.594 --> 11:05.610
- Good action. - Good wrist action.

11:05.610 --> 11:07.554
You know Matt's a horseman, right?

11:07.554 --> 11:10.554
He's got an entire fleet of horses.

11:10.554 --> 11:11.558
Is it fleet?

11:12.626 --> 11:16.546
Let's see those guys
hook a horse trailer up like that.

11:17.566 --> 11:18.622
A school?

11:18.622 --> 11:20.602
A school of horses?

11:20.602 --> 11:23.554
- I don't know. - My world now, boys!

11:31.598 --> 11:33.586
All right, here we go.

11:33.586 --> 11:34.598
He's got to nail this.

11:37.590 --> 11:39.534
Holy mackerel, look at that!

11:41.598 --> 11:42.626
That's a bang.

11:44.550 --> 11:47.594
- Lost it, he's lost his horse.
- He needs to get out the way of that
before it collects him.

11:47.594 --> 11:49.566
- He's lost his horse.
- Is he aware of it yet?

11:49.566 --> 11:51.530
No, he's not fully aware of it yet.

11:55.538 --> 11:56.574
Oh, look, he's seen it!

11:56.574 --> 11:58.550
There it is!

11:58.550 --> 11:59.614
I've lost the trailer.

11:59.614 --> 12:00.618
OK.

12:00.618 --> 12:04.582
But despite his horse bolting,
or unbolting...

12:04.582 --> 12:07.594
I think you're probably disqualified
if you lose your hitch.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.618
..Matt soldiered on.

12:10.586 --> 12:13.590
This is the equestrian equivalent of
falling off your horse and running

12:13.590 --> 12:16.582
round the course on your own
afterwards.

12:16.582 --> 12:19.614
The whole challenge is towing
that horse box.

12:19.614 --> 12:23.586
And the unencumbered Alfa took
the rest of the course with ease.

12:23.586 --> 12:24.606
Oh, my dear God!

12:26.554 --> 12:27.606
That looked...

12:27.606 --> 12:29.530
..violent!

12:29.530 --> 12:32.618
Except, that is, for the reverse
park into the finish enclosure.

12:32.618 --> 12:35.558
He's going to have to have two goes
at this, watch this.

12:42.558 --> 12:43.606
Does that count?

12:43.606 --> 12:44.618
Where's the horse?

12:45.618 --> 12:48.542
He's, he's over there, grazing.

12:48.542 --> 12:49.546
THEY LAUGH

12:51.586 --> 12:55.582
I'm guessing that I might not have,
probably didn't,

12:55.582 --> 12:57.618
I don't think I hooked it on
securely enough.

12:57.618 --> 13:00.578
You've got a time, but I'm not sure
it means anything.

13:00.578 --> 13:01.626
- Yeah. - OK, Rory, your go.

13:01.626 --> 13:05.594
Well, I don't really want to jump
my Velar, if I'm being honest.

13:05.594 --> 13:08.534
You're wearing your flight suit and
everything, come on.

13:09.598 --> 13:11.590
- Go for it. - Watch and learn.

13:11.590 --> 13:12.606
Go big or go home.

13:12.606 --> 13:13.626
Pull your jeans up, as well.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.530
Shut up!

13:17.550 --> 13:20.570
With Matt and his Stelvio falling
at the first fence, then,

13:20.570 --> 13:23.598
the stable door had been left wide
open for me and the Velar.

13:25.578 --> 13:28.534
It's not a bad looking car,
you know.

13:28.534 --> 13:29.610
Don't tell him. I'd never want to
admit it.

13:29.610 --> 13:31.594
No, why would you say that?

13:31.594 --> 13:32.614
All right, you ready?

13:32.614 --> 13:36.566
- Ready. - Three, two, one.

13:36.566 --> 13:37.606
KLAXON BLARES

13:40.546 --> 13:41.562
So, Velar.

13:42.586 --> 13:46.542
Bigger than an Evoque, smaller than
a Range Rover Sport,

13:46.542 --> 13:48.614
way better looking than both.

13:48.614 --> 13:51.590
- Oh, oh! - That was well judged.

13:51.590 --> 13:55.578
- Crikey! - Right, what am I doing, what
am I doing, what am I doing?

13:55.578 --> 13:57.586
I don't know what I'm doing!

14:00.538 --> 14:02.530
Turn the wheel round the other way.

14:02.530 --> 14:03.566
The emergency brake cable.

14:03.566 --> 14:04.586
It's snagged on the chain.

14:04.586 --> 14:07.602
It's snagged on the chain, undo it
and free it up and go straight, see?

14:07.602 --> 14:10.538
- That's fine. - No, no, the chain, if
it bounces,

14:10.538 --> 14:11.606
it will pull it out and set the
brake.

14:11.606 --> 14:14.566
I can't undo the brake cable without
taking the whole thing off.

14:14.566 --> 14:15.610
- Yeah. - Yeah. Sorry.

14:15.610 --> 14:17.538
Keep going, keep going!

14:17.538 --> 14:19.562
You've just sabotaged me by telling
me this isn't safe!

14:19.562 --> 14:23.534
- Keep going. - I'm going! - But you
forgot the... Whoa, whoa, whoa...

14:23.534 --> 14:25.534
- Shut up! - All right.

14:25.534 --> 14:26.598
Absolute tits!

14:28.550 --> 14:30.538
Undeterred by Matt's meddling,
though...

14:30.538 --> 14:31.626
We can make it up, we can make
it up.

14:31.626 --> 14:33.590
Once up and running... Brake...

14:33.590 --> 14:36.586
..the Velar took to the course
like a true thoroughbred.

14:37.602 --> 14:38.606
OK, let's go.

14:41.538 --> 14:44.546
Gliding through obstacles with
grace, poise...

14:44.546 --> 14:46.614
Woohoo!

14:46.614 --> 14:49.578
..and, crucially, a horse box.

14:50.594 --> 14:52.598
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.

14:52.598 --> 14:53.602
We're good at bouncing!

14:55.542 --> 14:58.602
The air suspension takes the hits
so much better than the Stelvio.

14:58.602 --> 15:01.550
This one's for England!

15:02.594 --> 15:03.606
Whoa!

15:05.598 --> 15:07.622
- Woohoo! - Oh, my lord.

15:09.602 --> 15:12.562
- This could be interesting.
- OK, reverse.

15:12.562 --> 15:15.546
And we do it this way, don't we, we
turn the other way, don't you?

15:15.546 --> 15:17.546
No, that's gone wrong, that's gone
wrong.

15:17.546 --> 15:20.566
Is that right? Why isn't it working?

15:20.566 --> 15:21.570
I can hear him yelling.

15:22.566 --> 15:24.554
I can't see a damn thing!

15:26.574 --> 15:28.590
- Is that in?
- You knocked the fence down.

15:28.590 --> 15:29.594
Stop the clock.

15:30.606 --> 15:32.558
Foul. Red card, for him?

15:32.558 --> 15:34.566
Well, at least he came back with a
trailer.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.538
OK... Hey!

15:39.558 --> 15:40.622
I mean, that's kind of in.

15:40.622 --> 15:42.582
- What happened? - That's in.

15:42.582 --> 15:44.558
- You missed the box. - I'm in the box.

15:44.558 --> 15:47.538
You weren't in the box, I'm more in
the box than you were when you did

15:47.538 --> 15:49.598
- your run. - Do you want to know your
time? - Yeah, tell me my time.

15:49.598 --> 15:52.590
You did
it in five minutes 47 seconds.

15:52.590 --> 15:55.534
- Oh! - Five minutes?! - You should have
just come in here,

15:55.534 --> 15:56.610
whipped it in and knocked the fence
down,

15:56.610 --> 15:58.554
it would have been much quicker.

15:58.554 --> 16:00.566
I tried, though, man, look, I
actually, look, look,

16:00.566 --> 16:02.618
- that made me bleed my own blood.
- That? You call that bleeding?

16:02.618 --> 16:04.610
Yeah, I'll probably get rabies now.

16:04.610 --> 16:07.614
Unlikely. And while Rory would sadly
make a full recovery,

16:07.614 --> 16:10.618
the same couldn't be said for
his horse.

16:10.618 --> 16:12.570
Here we go.

16:12.570 --> 16:14.578
Oh! The headless horse.

16:14.578 --> 16:16.602
It is a Sicilian stallion.

16:19.550 --> 16:21.602
So far, one of us has taken the
thick end of a day

16:21.602 --> 16:23.542
to complete the course,

16:23.542 --> 16:25.578
and the other one didn't come back
with a horse.

16:25.578 --> 16:27.558
Yeah, I think this is looking good
for you.

16:27.558 --> 16:28.598
This is looking good for me.

16:31.534 --> 16:34.566
After all, Volvo is practically
Swedish for horse.

16:35.594 --> 16:38.534
Mode - off-road.

16:38.534 --> 16:40.542
That raises my suspension.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.582
Three, two, one.

16:42.582 --> 16:44.538
KLAXON BLARES

16:45.562 --> 16:46.618
Here he goes.

16:46.618 --> 16:52.614
Right, first unfair advantage,
I have tow bar assist mode.

16:52.614 --> 16:56.606
Follow the line, and you shall hitch
more easily.

16:58.614 --> 17:00.558
Oh, that's pretty good.

17:00.558 --> 17:01.578
What do we think?

17:01.578 --> 17:02.582
That looks good.

17:03.586 --> 17:04.606
Feels good.

17:06.546 --> 17:07.550
So, let's go.

17:10.541 --> 17:11.554
Oh!

17:13.541 --> 17:14.558
This last few hours,

17:14.558 --> 17:17.578
he's been going on and on and on
about how SUVs

17:17.578 --> 17:19.569
aren't all about power and speed.

17:21.602 --> 17:23.609
Oh, bloody hell, that hurt.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.617
Is he still thinking the same thing?

17:25.617 --> 17:29.618
- No. - You see, it's a Volvo, Volvos
are built to do this.

17:29.618 --> 17:34.554
Unfortunately for Chris, though,
Volvos weren't built to do this.

17:36.618 --> 17:38.534
Oh!

17:38.534 --> 17:40.614
- Oh! - I've got noises now.

17:40.614 --> 17:42.598
RATTLING

17:42.598 --> 17:44.586
That doesn't sound very good.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.550
I think we've got a technical fault.

17:48.550 --> 17:50.618
- What's the matter?
- It's making a terrible noise.

17:50.618 --> 17:52.574
Should I stop the clock, or...?

17:54.550 --> 17:57.590
It's making a terrible noise
but I don't know why!

17:57.590 --> 17:59.626
Actually, you might have this in
the bag, Rory.

18:02.586 --> 18:03.594
RATTLING

18:03.594 --> 18:05.558
I don't hear any funny noise,
do you?

18:07.562 --> 18:10.618
Wow. He's actually got it in,
eventually.

18:10.618 --> 18:12.574
- OK. - Oh.

18:14.574 --> 18:18.566
- Yep. - Yeah. - OK, now, yeah, leave it,
leave it, that's good.

18:18.566 --> 18:22.594
So, after three successful-ish runs
through the arena,

18:22.594 --> 18:24.566
who had come out on top?

18:24.566 --> 18:26.626
First of all, it's in the
garage area.

18:26.626 --> 18:28.598
- Yeah. - And I didn't knock a fence
down.

18:28.598 --> 18:29.606
- Yeah. - OK? - That's not bad.

18:29.606 --> 18:31.542
It's more in there than mine was.

18:31.542 --> 18:32.614
Yeah.

18:32.614 --> 18:35.546
- I know you're excited.
- How is he holding up?

18:35.546 --> 18:37.538
Look at that!

18:37.538 --> 18:38.614
I mean, he's missing a leg...

18:38.614 --> 18:42.602
A lot less mayhem than either of you
two caused, agreed?

18:42.602 --> 18:44.570
I'd say so.

18:44.570 --> 18:47.570
I never actually saw my horse,
but what really matters is...

18:47.570 --> 18:49.582
Yeah? The time.

18:49.582 --> 18:51.598
- OK. - Come on. - Rory, what was your
time?

18:51.598 --> 18:55.566
- 5.46.47. - 5.46.47!

18:56.614 --> 18:58.558
Wow. OK, Chris.

18:58.558 --> 18:59.606
- Yeah. - You did it... - Yep.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.626
..in a 5.48.9.

19:02.582 --> 19:05.618
- Oh! - That's atrocious. - I had to stop
for a technical difficulty!

19:05.618 --> 19:08.550
If you hadn't done that, you'd
have won.

19:08.550 --> 19:09.602
Wait, before we go...

19:09.602 --> 19:11.546
- Yeah? - Victory dab.

19:12.598 --> 19:13.626
- I'm out. - What?!

19:15.590 --> 19:17.590
You're endorsing that kind of
behaviour?!

19:17.590 --> 19:19.622
You let him win, and now that's what
we have to put up with.

19:19.622 --> 19:21.610
My car made a terrible noise,
I had to stop!

19:21.610 --> 19:24.534
My car made a lot of terrible
noises...

19:25.586 --> 19:26.614
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

19:35.618 --> 19:39.530
You know what?
I've got to say,

19:39.530 --> 19:43.594
until I used an SUV to jump a
horse box over a paddling pool,

19:43.594 --> 19:46.562
I had no idea how amazing I would be
at that.

19:46.562 --> 19:50.570
Congratulations. We have finally
found a motorsport you can do.

19:50.570 --> 19:51.610
Touche.

19:51.610 --> 19:55.590
Now we must move on to what was
meant to be a nice little film about

19:55.590 --> 19:58.610
a plucky sports car company coming
back from the dead,

19:58.610 --> 20:01.622
a phoenix from the flames,
if you will.

20:01.622 --> 20:05.558
But, as you'll see, we got a few
more flames than we bargained for.

20:13.618 --> 20:19.606
The year was 1961, when a company
called Alpine introduced the A110.

20:23.562 --> 20:25.586
And while you may never have heard
of it,

20:25.586 --> 20:29.558
this pretty little French coupe
became a giant slayer.

20:34.586 --> 20:38.598
Based on humble Renault
underpinnings, in 1973,

20:38.598 --> 20:42.578
it entered the very first
World Rally Championship, and won.

20:44.566 --> 20:47.546
In fact, in that year's
Monte Carlo Rally,

20:47.546 --> 20:50.586
five of the top six finishers
were A110s.

20:50.586 --> 20:53.538
A rally legend was born.

20:56.566 --> 21:02.610
But, outgunned by new arrivals,
by 1977, the A110 was finished.

21:02.610 --> 21:06.606
Alpine, now under Renault ownership,
more or less sank without a trace.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.582
Until now.

21:20.586 --> 21:23.558
Here it is, then,
the new Alpine A110.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.566
A two-seat, all-aluminium
sports car

21:28.566 --> 21:30.602
that takes the spirit of the
original,

21:30.602 --> 21:33.562
and updates it for the modern age.

21:37.542 --> 21:40.554
Now, Alpine is still owned
by Renault,

21:40.554 --> 21:42.626
but there isn't a Renault badge
anywhere on this car.

21:44.542 --> 21:45.606
And that's a good thing.

21:45.606 --> 21:47.578
As is the way it goes.

21:49.554 --> 21:51.574
Boy, is it good to drive!

21:58.566 --> 21:59.622
Sacre bleu!

21:59.622 --> 22:03.554
Mon dieu! Zut, and, indeed, alors!

22:03.554 --> 22:04.626
This is a fast car!

22:07.554 --> 22:10.602
The A110 does 0-60 in 4.5 seconds,

22:10.602 --> 22:14.558
which puts it firmly in
the not-a-Renault category.

22:18.606 --> 22:19.610
Oh, yes!

22:23.626 --> 22:25.610
And there's a good reason for that,

22:25.610 --> 22:30.558
because the A110 is all about one
thing - lightness.

22:31.578 --> 22:33.586
These seats -

22:33.586 --> 22:36.614
half the weight of your normal
sports seat.

22:36.614 --> 22:38.602
That saves 13kg.

22:40.586 --> 22:42.554
The handbrake,

22:42.554 --> 22:44.618
well, that's integrated into
the main braking system.

22:44.618 --> 22:48.622
I know, exciting stuff, but it saves
another 2.5kg.

22:50.586 --> 22:54.558
In fact, everywhere they could
possibly save any weight at all,

22:54.558 --> 22:55.610
they did.

22:59.586 --> 23:03.602
Overall, the A110 weighs just
1,100kg,

23:03.602 --> 23:08.590
that's 350 kilos lighter than that
Audi TT RS.

23:10.590 --> 23:14.538
Now I know 350 kilos is kind of
difficult to picture,

23:14.538 --> 23:15.618
so allow me to put that another way.

23:18.570 --> 23:21.550
This is why there aren't many
piano buskers...

23:21.550 --> 23:22.554
RATTLING

23:23.598 --> 23:24.626
DISCORDANT NOTES

23:26.570 --> 23:32.570
So, driving round in one of THOSE is
the equivalent of driving round in

23:32.570 --> 23:36.558
one of THOSE with one of THESE
on the roof.

23:42.578 --> 23:45.570
This single-minded attitude to
weight saving

23:45.570 --> 23:49.542
is what really characterises
the A110.

23:49.542 --> 23:52.594
The way it feels, and the way it
drives.

23:56.598 --> 24:01.578
All that lightness means it corners
with real delicacy.

24:04.614 --> 24:07.582
It's got double wishbone suspension
all round,

24:07.582 --> 24:10.590
and that is the best gear available.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.590
And, crucially, Alpine hasn't made
it too stiff,

24:15.590 --> 24:17.594
there's a bit of roll in
the corners.

24:19.558 --> 24:22.594
That might sound like a bad thing,
but it isn't.

24:30.578 --> 24:31.590
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

24:35.546 --> 24:36.550
Oh, yes.

24:43.618 --> 24:45.606
Now, being mid-engined,

24:45.606 --> 24:49.558
there is slightly more weight at
the back than the front,

24:49.558 --> 24:51.598
so when you're feeling really
irresponsible...

24:53.590 --> 24:55.614
..it does want to swap ends a bit.

24:58.562 --> 25:00.578
But it is so much fun!

25:02.598 --> 25:05.622
Car manufacturers have for years
told us that sports cars should be

25:05.622 --> 25:10.550
stiffly sprung, and hard riding
and flat handling.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.626
It's absolute rubbish.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.590
So what's not to like?

25:18.590 --> 25:21.618
Well, though Alpine is keen to
stress this isn't a Renault...

25:23.602 --> 25:26.546
..most of the A110's switches and
levers

25:26.546 --> 25:28.558
do come from the Renault parts bin.

25:29.626 --> 25:33.562
As does the engine, which, a little
unimaginatively,

25:33.562 --> 25:36.574
is the same four-cylinder 1.8 turbo
you'll find

25:36.574 --> 25:38.618
in the new Megane hot hatch.

25:41.622 --> 25:45.614
But what's really not to like is
the price.

25:45.614 --> 25:50.542
This Premiere Edition, which is
French for Premier Edition,

25:50.542 --> 25:55.598
costs about 58,000 euros,
which is over £50,000,

25:55.598 --> 25:57.566
which is a lot.

25:58.610 --> 26:01.590
In fact, it's the same price
as that.

26:04.626 --> 26:07.594
The Porsche Cayman, the S,
the fast one.

26:09.534 --> 26:12.594
I know we always test new sports
cars against Caymans,

26:12.594 --> 26:14.530
but it's the best car.

26:16.550 --> 26:20.622
So, time to find out if Alpine is
still in the business

26:20.622 --> 26:22.590
of giant slaying.

26:32.590 --> 26:33.598
Ah...

26:35.602 --> 26:37.542
Ah...

26:41.550 --> 26:45.542
Ah... Yeah, we're not really socking
it to Porsche, I mean,

26:45.542 --> 26:46.622
it's not getting any closer.

26:50.594 --> 26:54.610
A little bit disappointing, but,
you know what, if I'm honest,

26:54.610 --> 26:56.578
it's not really unexpected, is it?

26:56.578 --> 26:59.550
It's got 100 horsepower less than
the Porsche.

27:06.566 --> 27:08.586
And that is exactly the point.

27:17.570 --> 27:19.602
The A110 isn't about drag races.

27:20.602 --> 27:23.606
This is a car that sacrifices
straight line speed

27:23.606 --> 27:25.582
in the name of something nobler.

27:28.622 --> 27:34.538
This is a car for the real world,
real roads, real corners.

27:36.606 --> 27:42.554
Which means this race track is not
where the Alpine is meant to live.

27:42.554 --> 27:48.570
That's right, Top Gear's quantum
portal...thingy is back.

27:48.570 --> 27:51.554
It's time to go left at Hammerhead.

27:52.562 --> 27:53.598
Here we go.

28:10.554 --> 28:11.582
Oh, yes!

28:13.618 --> 28:18.598
Racing gloves, race suit,
mountains, this is perfect,

28:18.598 --> 28:20.618
this is Alpine country.

28:27.626 --> 28:29.530
I'm in heaven.

28:31.622 --> 28:34.602
I'm loving this.
This is just spot-on.

28:36.554 --> 28:37.618
Hang on a minute, whoa!

28:39.614 --> 28:42.598
This looks a bit serious.

28:45.562 --> 28:46.582
This is a rally.

28:51.614 --> 28:53.586
The Monte Carlo Rally...

28:54.590 --> 28:57.586
..scene of the original
A110's triumph,

28:57.586 --> 29:01.594
and still jewel in the crown of the
current World Rally Championship.

29:04.586 --> 29:07.554
A relentless alpine assault of

29:07.554 --> 29:10.598
uneven asphalt and unsighted
corners.

29:13.598 --> 29:17.538
Running this gauntlet takes
experience, skill,

29:17.538 --> 29:19.614
and above all
a cool-headed co-driver.

29:20.622 --> 29:22.622
Chris! Chris!

29:22.622 --> 29:26.614
- Eddie?! - Put that on, we're going to
do the Monte Carlo Rally, come on!

29:26.614 --> 29:28.618
- No, we're not... - Come on, Chris,
Chris, Chris,

29:28.618 --> 29:30.594
they're calling us to the
start line!

29:30.594 --> 29:32.594
Come on, get the hat on, get it on!

29:32.594 --> 29:33.598
Come on!

29:36.538 --> 29:39.558
Do you know anything at all
about co-driving?

29:39.558 --> 29:40.614
I only live around the corner,

29:40.614 --> 29:43.534
I know this place like the back of
my hand!

29:43.534 --> 29:44.622
That's the front of your hand!

29:44.622 --> 29:46.614
Don't question your co-driver!

29:49.562 --> 29:51.586
Oh, my God...

29:52.626 --> 29:56.570
This is a really, really bad idea.

30:00.594 --> 30:03.606
There's world rally cars everywhere!

30:05.614 --> 30:09.550
- This is unbelievable!
- That's Jari-Matti Latvala!

30:09.550 --> 30:12.538
Look at the Toyota, look at the back
of the Toyota!

30:12.538 --> 30:15.574
That's an M-Sport world rally car,
that's Elfyn Evans.

30:15.574 --> 30:16.590
That is Elfyn Evans!

30:21.570 --> 30:23.574
Oh, my God, did you see that?!

30:23.574 --> 30:25.550
That's insane!

30:25.550 --> 30:27.538
Look, now we're up to the start...

30:29.558 --> 30:32.542
When we get down towards the lower
numbers, don't tell anyone,

30:32.542 --> 30:33.546
we'll go at two.

30:35.538 --> 30:39.590
Get the revs up. Five, four, three,
go, go, go, go, go!

30:42.574 --> 30:44.574
We're away, we're away, we're away!

30:46.558 --> 30:48.586
Come on! Faster, faster!

30:48.586 --> 30:51.538
Drive it like you stole it, man!

30:54.546 --> 30:55.598
Hairpin left, hairpin left!

30:58.602 --> 31:00.590
Have you ever done this before?

31:00.590 --> 31:03.530
What, yelling at somebody from the
passenger seat?

31:03.530 --> 31:04.558
Of course, all the time!

31:06.550 --> 31:08.530
Can you quicken this up?

31:08.530 --> 31:09.602
My granny goes quicker than this!

31:10.610 --> 31:14.578
Despite Eddie's unique co-driving
style...

31:14.578 --> 31:17.530
Fast left, fast left, fast left!

31:17.530 --> 31:20.534
- And another fast left!
- Everything can't be a fast left!

31:20.534 --> 31:22.598
..the Alpine was magnificent.

31:24.598 --> 31:26.598
I love it!

31:27.626 --> 31:30.618
Built for roads just like this.

31:30.618 --> 31:34.578
- This car is superb.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

31:34.578 --> 31:36.530
Doesn't it feel so right here?

31:37.594 --> 31:40.562
But, just a few minutes into
the stage...

31:42.538 --> 31:44.574
- ..the Alpine faulted.
- BEEPING

31:44.574 --> 31:46.558
"Electric failure danger."

31:49.582 --> 31:51.626
We're by the side of the road,
we're by the side of the road.

31:51.626 --> 31:53.558
It's a total conk out.

31:53.558 --> 31:55.618
- RADIO: Fire, fire, fire! - Oh, it's
on fire, it's on fire, get out!

31:55.618 --> 31:57.602
- Get out, get out, get out!
- Come on.

32:04.542 --> 32:05.558
CRACKLING AND POPPING

32:05.558 --> 32:06.562
INDISTINCT SHOUTS

32:09.578 --> 32:11.534
Come away! Come away!

32:11.534 --> 32:13.542
POPPING

32:13.542 --> 32:16.550
Everybody back from the vehicle now,
please, thank you.

32:16.550 --> 32:18.538
That ain't going to put it out,
mate.

32:21.542 --> 32:22.574
POPPING

32:26.626 --> 32:28.546
EXPLOSION

32:35.606 --> 32:37.546
Well, I hate it when you can't get

32:37.546 --> 32:38.618
the temperature right in the car,
huh?

32:38.618 --> 32:41.614
It's either too cold, or on fire...

32:42.618 --> 32:46.602
- What happened? - I'd literally been
driving it for a few minutes,

32:46.602 --> 32:48.586
the warning light comes on
the dashboard,

32:48.586 --> 32:50.578
something about electrical failure,
stop.

32:50.578 --> 32:52.622
The power cuts almost immediately,

32:52.622 --> 32:56.598
and the first time I knew it was on
fire was when I opened the car door

32:56.598 --> 32:59.554
and the flames licked straight up
my arm.

32:59.554 --> 33:01.534
Yep, that's a dead giveaway.

33:01.534 --> 33:04.598
But, most importantly,
everyone's OK, no-one injured.

33:04.598 --> 33:06.546
Well, apart from the car.

33:06.546 --> 33:09.582
- Nah, the car's fine. - The car's fine?

33:09.582 --> 33:12.530
- Yeah. - OK, this is what it looked
like a few minutes later.

33:13.594 --> 33:15.578
Oh, look at that, it IS mid-engined.

33:16.594 --> 33:18.598
It handles so well, that thing.

33:18.598 --> 33:19.602
Handled...

33:21.530 --> 33:22.534
..so well.

33:23.550 --> 33:25.570
But, being serious for a second,

33:25.570 --> 33:28.570
Alpine would like us to make it
clear that that car was a prototype,

33:28.570 --> 33:30.542
not a finished production car.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.550
They say they've conducted
a full investigation,

33:32.550 --> 33:33.590
and have concluded that...

33:34.614 --> 33:37.598
"This isolated fire incident was
caused by a fuel leak.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.622
"Robust measures have been put in
place to ensure

33:39.622 --> 33:42.622
"that such an incident
cannot re-occur."

33:42.622 --> 33:45.534
Basically, they're going to remove
all the fire

33:45.534 --> 33:46.578
before putting them on sale.

33:47.602 --> 33:51.598
- Are you done? - Well, I can't think of
any more right now, so, yeah.

33:51.598 --> 33:56.614
OK, but they've given us another car
so we can see just how fast it goes

33:56.614 --> 33:58.594
around our test track.

33:58.594 --> 34:01.566
Yep, and let's just say there
weren't a whole lot of volunteers to

34:01.566 --> 34:04.622
drive this one. In fact, only one.

34:04.622 --> 34:06.562
It's the Stig.

34:06.562 --> 34:09.594
Here he is, then, Le Stig, on
the start line in the Alpine.

34:09.594 --> 34:12.534
Mid-engined, so good traction off
the line, seven-speed,

34:12.534 --> 34:15.606
dual-clutch gearbox shifting
quickly, using all the track,

34:15.606 --> 34:17.610
as our white-suited friend
always does.

34:17.610 --> 34:20.534
Into this second corner now.

34:20.534 --> 34:23.550
Look how soft it is, all that roll
gives this car a lovely language of

34:23.550 --> 34:25.585
speed. Again, using all the track,

34:25.585 --> 34:28.581
turning left on that kink before
the right-hand turn,

34:28.581 --> 34:31.558
it's a good test of agility, this,
right into Chicago.

34:31.558 --> 34:32.585
Again, watch the roll.

34:32.585 --> 34:34.590
The traction's good, it's feeding
gears in.

34:34.590 --> 34:36.534
Up, up, up,

34:36.534 --> 34:38.530
only 250 horsepower, but 1,100 kg,

34:38.530 --> 34:39.621
so good power-to-weight ratio.

34:39.621 --> 34:42.610
A great-looking machine, as well,
breaking hard now into Hammerhead,

34:42.610 --> 34:45.534
there's a good direction change
here, a jink left,

34:45.534 --> 34:47.601
and now turning right.
Look at that roll.

34:47.601 --> 34:50.590
Roll equals grip, roll is good,
most people are wrong,

34:50.590 --> 34:53.558
we don't want flat handling,
anodyne sports cars.

34:53.558 --> 34:56.585
Powering out, engine sounds really
good, little parps on the up shifts,

34:56.585 --> 34:58.622
Follow Through, that's quick
through there.

34:58.622 --> 35:02.606
Little straight now, into the tyre
wall. That looks quick,

35:02.606 --> 35:05.546
and a big bump and a little wiggle
of oversteer,

35:05.546 --> 35:07.626
that's just showboating from the
Stig there, didn't need to do that.

35:07.626 --> 35:10.586
Now just coming in, trail braking
into second-to-last,

35:10.586 --> 35:13.578
using all the curve and a bit more
on the inside, rude on the outside,

35:13.578 --> 35:16.546
and watch this now. He's always
cheeky there, robbing the kerbs,

35:16.546 --> 35:17.598
over the line.

35:19.578 --> 35:21.614
- Ooh, yeah. - Good lap, very good lap.

35:21.614 --> 35:23.558
Exciting looking car.

35:23.558 --> 35:26.558
That looked fast. Got a great
looking stance to it.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.606
- Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, all right.

35:28.606 --> 35:32.530
The Alpine A110 went around our
track

35:32.530 --> 35:34.550
in 1.22.09.

35:34.550 --> 35:36.546
Oh, that's a good effort!

35:36.546 --> 35:38.566
That's a
good effort, pretty good effort.

35:38.566 --> 35:40.542
That is good.

35:41.550 --> 35:44.578
- You are a child. - Thank you.

35:44.578 --> 35:48.614
All right. Now it's time to put a
star in our Reasonably Fast Car.

35:48.614 --> 35:52.530
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Jason Manford!

35:56.550 --> 35:57.574
Hello.

35:57.574 --> 36:01.550
- Hiya, mate. - Welcome to the show.
- Thank you very much.

36:01.550 --> 36:04.610
Thank you. Oh, lovely.

36:04.610 --> 36:06.626
This is all right, isn't it?

36:06.626 --> 36:09.562
Yeah. Great to have you.

36:09.562 --> 36:10.626
Hey, great to be here.

36:10.626 --> 36:13.614
I don't know how I'm going to follow
that Alpine, my goodness.

36:13.614 --> 36:16.598
I mean, I'm from Manchester, and
I've seen a lot of cars on fire,

36:16.598 --> 36:19.566
but that was spectacular.
That was amazing.

36:19.566 --> 36:21.606
What was great was I was watching
on a monitor back there,

36:21.606 --> 36:24.562
and as the camera sort of swoops in
for the scene afterwards,

36:24.562 --> 36:26.534
everyone around it just took a
step back.

36:26.534 --> 36:29.530
It was amazing to watch!

36:29.530 --> 36:30.598
You are touring at the moment.

36:30.598 --> 36:32.590
I am, yeah. I'm on tour, I'm doing

36:32.590 --> 36:34.622
all over the country until
Christmas.

36:34.622 --> 36:37.546
We're doing a show called
Muddle Class,

36:37.546 --> 36:39.582
which is sort of about where I am
in my life,

36:39.582 --> 36:42.606
which is I'm from quite a
working-class background,

36:42.606 --> 36:45.570
and I've done all right,
doing my job,

36:45.570 --> 36:48.606
and then now I'm in a position where
my kids, they're a bit middle class,

36:48.606 --> 36:50.622
and I'm sort of stuck in the middle,
because,

36:50.622 --> 36:52.618
I don't know if anyone else
has this,

36:52.618 --> 36:55.626
but it's quite hard to raise kids
who are posher than you, you know?

36:55.626 --> 36:59.534
Because what you don't want to do is
raise kids that when you were a kid

36:59.534 --> 37:01.530
you didn't like, you know what I
mean?

37:01.530 --> 37:02.598
So that's what's hard!

37:02.598 --> 37:05.626
I feel you on that one,
sometimes I just don't feed them.

37:05.626 --> 37:07.570
It balances it out.

37:07.570 --> 37:10.594
So you must cover a lot of miles,
touring, I would imagine, yeah?

37:10.594 --> 37:12.554
Yeah, God, we must do...

37:12.554 --> 37:15.602
Well, certainly when I was doing
the club circuit, you do, like,

37:15.602 --> 37:19.558
60,000 miles a year, like, yeah,
you'd be all over the place.

37:19.558 --> 37:21.558
How do you deal with all the time
on the road?

37:21.558 --> 37:23.558
I mean, what do you do to pass the
time?

37:23.558 --> 37:26.566
Well, I either drive, or sometimes
the tour manager drives,

37:26.566 --> 37:28.542
and that can be hard as well.

37:28.542 --> 37:33.534
We're in, like, a Viano thing a lot
of the time, so there was...

37:33.534 --> 37:35.626
and it's weird, because sometimes
you get off stage, and, you know,

37:35.626 --> 37:38.598
you're on top of the world, you
know, you've just finished a show,

37:38.598 --> 37:40.622
and you're in the back of a car,
and he's driving off.

37:40.622 --> 37:44.530
And we were driving from Northampton
to York, a little while back,

37:44.530 --> 37:46.578
all the showbiz places
that I do, like,

37:46.578 --> 37:49.566
and I'd had something to eat before
the gig, some chicken or something,

37:49.566 --> 37:52.534
I don't know what it was, but it was
not quite right.

37:52.534 --> 37:54.554
And I was in the back of the car,
and I was thinking,

37:54.554 --> 37:56.602
"Oh, I don't feel so right,"
it's quite a long drive, you know,

37:56.602 --> 37:58.590
I'm in the back there, I don't feel
so right.

37:58.590 --> 38:01.570
And I didn't know, it's a new tour,
you know, it's a new tour manager,

38:01.570 --> 38:04.550
we don't know each other that well
for you to just give him the truth.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.626
So I said, "I need to just stop off
at some point."

38:06.626 --> 38:10.626
He said, "There's no services," you
know, as you get on the A1,
there's nothing up there, you know.

38:10.626 --> 38:14.554
I said, "Just anywhere's fine,
anywhere's absolutely fine.

38:14.554 --> 38:17.554
"Just a wooded area, I'll take a
wooded area."

38:18.562 --> 38:20.602
He said, "Do you need a..." I said,
"I just need a wee, yeah."

38:20.602 --> 38:25.534
Anyway, he pulled over, and I went
into the woods, as far as I could,

38:25.534 --> 38:28.558
and, I mean, there's no delicate way
of saying it, you know,

38:28.558 --> 38:31.530
I just had to, it's not just bears
that do it, that's what I'm saying.

38:32.582 --> 38:34.558
- I don't understand... - No, good!

38:35.566 --> 38:39.554
There was just a moment where, I
mean, it cost me two socks, as well,

38:39.554 --> 38:42.582
but, I know, it doesn't get better.

38:42.582 --> 38:45.554
It doesn't get better, this story,
I'm sorry!

38:46.626 --> 38:50.546
There was definitely a moment where
I was stood there, just thinking,

38:50.546 --> 38:51.594
"Is this my life?"

38:53.570 --> 38:55.562
I was just onstage, rapturous
applause,

38:55.562 --> 38:56.586
and now I'm in the middle of...

38:56.586 --> 38:59.550
I've still got scratches, I've still
got scratches on my arm from

38:59.550 --> 39:02.598
the brambles, it was like the worst
follow-up to Blair Witch.

39:04.578 --> 39:07.558
I think I'd rather find
the Blair Witch than what I left.

39:13.566 --> 39:17.534
I wasn't planning on telling that,
but there we are, we're there now,

39:17.534 --> 39:19.626
- we're here now! - And, moving on...

39:19.626 --> 39:22.550
Right, OK,

39:22.550 --> 39:24.614
so you went out on the track with
Chris for a bit of training.

39:24.614 --> 39:28.590
- I did, yeah. - How did that go? - Yeah,
it's all right, it's weird, because,

39:28.590 --> 39:32.566
you know, I drive a seven-seater,
you know, I've got kids in the car,

39:32.566 --> 39:36.602
school run, I don't really put
my foot down, you know?

39:36.602 --> 39:39.626
So it was exciting,
I've got to say, but scary.

39:39.626 --> 39:42.566
- Well, let's take a look at the
training. - Yep.

39:42.566 --> 39:44.602
We've had a few comedians on the
show this season.

39:44.602 --> 39:47.598
- I know... - And I'm told that where
you sit on the leaderboard equates

39:47.598 --> 39:50.558
- to roughly how funny you are.
- I'm not sure about that.

39:50.558 --> 39:53.554
- Are you sure? - Yeah, because
generally what happens is the
open spot,

39:53.554 --> 39:56.574
or whoever's less down on the bill,
has to drive the headliner.

39:56.574 --> 39:59.570
- Oh, OK... - So actually the worse
a comic you are,

39:59.570 --> 40:00.622
the better the driver.

40:00.622 --> 40:02.586
That's a good comeback. First gear.

40:03.618 --> 40:06.554
I don't believe it for a minute,
but let's go, come on.

40:06.554 --> 40:08.578
I don't even know how that came out
of my head!

40:09.614 --> 40:11.570
Straight on to the 50.

40:11.570 --> 40:13.626
Is this a good time to ask you
how many times you failed

40:13.626 --> 40:16.566
- your driving test? - Erm,

40:16.566 --> 40:17.598
I passed on my sixth.

40:17.598 --> 40:19.534
You passed on your sixth?

40:19.534 --> 40:20.594
Yeah, so I failed five times.

40:20.594 --> 40:23.574
- What's the best fail?
- The best fail, the worst fail?

40:23.574 --> 40:26.562
Yeah. I think it was when I got to
a roundabout, and he said, right,

40:26.562 --> 40:29.530
go straight over here, and I went
straight over the roundabout.

40:29.530 --> 40:30.622
You went straight over the
roundabout?!

40:30.622 --> 40:32.578
Yeah. Well, he said go straight
over.

40:32.578 --> 40:35.542
Bearing in mind it was one of the
ones painted on the floor,

40:35.542 --> 40:37.618
it wasn't like a load of flowers and
that, you know?

40:37.618 --> 40:41.598
Left. That could be interesting,
that could be very interesting.

40:41.598 --> 40:43.574
That could be VERY interesting!

40:47.558 --> 40:51.594
If you were just 5% off that, it
would be brilliant, as it was...

40:51.594 --> 40:54.546
I hope my car insurers aren't
watching this!

40:54.546 --> 40:57.598
Now, between the tyres and the
grass... I'm going to close my eyes.

40:57.598 --> 40:59.610
See how fast, just be brave,
do whatever you want.

41:02.554 --> 41:04.562
Make the left, make the left or
we're off.

41:07.550 --> 41:10.594
Right, at the hundred, braking,
brake, brake, brake, brake, brake!

41:15.578 --> 41:17.602
A bit more brake, did you say?

41:17.602 --> 41:20.530
Bit more brake!
So when I say "bit more brake"...

41:20.530 --> 41:22.566
- Oh, yeah, what does that mean?
- The clue is in the last word.

41:24.534 --> 41:29.570
There is every chance that you could
go very quickly, or die,

41:29.570 --> 41:30.578
it's one of the two.

41:30.578 --> 41:33.574
Hey, I think that's fine,
I'm prepared to take that risk.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.578
Good man.

41:37.598 --> 41:39.558
Very good work.

41:40.622 --> 41:43.614
- It's fun, right? - It's a lot of fun,
yeah, it's a lot of fun.

41:43.614 --> 41:46.594
- Yeah. - Terrified. - All right, let's
talk a little bit about your car

41:46.594 --> 41:49.550
- history now. - Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Where does it all start?

41:49.550 --> 41:52.610
When I eventually passed my
driving test, on the sixth time,

41:52.610 --> 41:55.618
as you just heard, it took me a
long time to pass,

41:55.618 --> 41:58.554
I thought some of them were unfair
as well, to be honest.

41:58.554 --> 42:00.614
I remember one, I got to a junction,
I looked right, and I said,

42:00.614 --> 42:03.590
"All right your side?" That was a
fail. Unbelievable.

42:03.590 --> 42:05.550
Unbelievable.
I do it all the time now.

42:06.574 --> 42:09.570
My first car was a Citroen ZX.

42:09.570 --> 42:13.542
- They were lethal. - Yeah, they were,
and I bumped that one a few times,

42:13.542 --> 42:16.586
yeah. I mean, I certainly wouldn't
be parked that close to a park...

42:19.558 --> 42:20.622
That is not the place to put it.

42:20.622 --> 42:22.602
OK, then what was after that one?

42:22.602 --> 42:25.578
And then, I thought, right,
I'm going to step up here,

42:25.578 --> 42:28.606
I just started doing some telly,
I thought, I'm doing all right,

42:28.606 --> 42:31.542
I need a nice car, that's what I
need to get.

42:31.542 --> 42:34.554
- That's that moment. - Yeah, it was
that moment, so I got a lease car,

42:34.554 --> 42:36.618
which is obviously when you buy a
car that you can't afford yet.

42:36.618 --> 42:39.558
- Right. - And they baffle you with all
legal jargon,

42:39.558 --> 42:41.534
"Then there's a balloon payment."

42:41.534 --> 42:44.542
You're like, "I like balloons!" And
so I was like, fine, I'll have that.

42:44.542 --> 42:46.610
And I got the, it just came out,
I think, that year,

42:46.610 --> 42:51.550
I got the Jaguar XF just when it was
first released.

42:51.550 --> 42:54.598
And nobody had them, they weren't
on the road at the time,

42:54.598 --> 42:58.534
it's quite weird driving a car that
no-one else has seen before.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.582
There's normally a reason for that.

42:59.582 --> 43:03.582
- Yeah. - Well, yeah, it was new, it was
new, that was mainly the reason.

43:03.582 --> 43:06.562
But then as I sort of drove it
a lot,

43:06.562 --> 43:09.550
I'd see the other sort of people
buying that car,

43:09.550 --> 43:13.530
and they were very much not in
their late 20s, early 30s,

43:13.530 --> 43:15.538
they were like my dad's age,
and I was, like,

43:15.538 --> 43:17.562
"Oh, oh, I'm driving
an old man's car!"

43:17.562 --> 43:20.550
There is one image we can show you
that will undo all of that pain, OK?

43:20.550 --> 43:22.590
You're going to love this. Come on.

43:22.590 --> 43:24.562
Oh, well, you can't go wrong there.

43:24.562 --> 43:27.546
- Come on. - You see? - I mean, he wasn't
looking for the Isofix, though,

43:27.546 --> 43:28.566
- was he? - No.

43:28.566 --> 43:30.542
You know what I mean?

43:30.542 --> 43:31.582
You don't have the Jag any more?

43:31.582 --> 43:35.534
We don't have the Jaguar, that had
to go, I just had too many kids for
the amount of seats.

43:35.534 --> 43:38.574
It's not like when you were a kid,
and your dad would get the whole of
the football team

43:38.574 --> 43:41.546
- in the back of his Orion, you know?
- It's just called maths, isn't it?

43:41.546 --> 43:43.554
Yeah, exactly, but the rules were
just different,

43:43.554 --> 43:45.610
I definitely remember as a kid,
six of us on the back seat,

43:45.610 --> 43:48.550
captain lying across their lap,
two in the passenger seat,

43:48.550 --> 43:50.606
one in the foot well, whoever was
fastest had to run alongside.

43:50.606 --> 43:52.626
You know what I mean? It was just
different, wasn't it?

43:52.626 --> 43:58.594
But now, very stringent on the old
rules, and so we went seven-seater,
and we got a Sharan.

43:58.594 --> 44:03.614
And I remember being so distraught,
as I was getting rid of the Jaguar,

44:03.614 --> 44:06.554
and getting that one,
and the salesman had said to me,

44:06.554 --> 44:07.602
"Would you like to test drive it?

44:07.602 --> 44:11.566
And I said, "I'd like to drive it
the least amount of times."

44:14.530 --> 44:16.578
"I'll just take it, it's fine."

44:16.578 --> 44:18.570
What am I going to learn?
But also, you know,

44:18.570 --> 44:20.566
I'm getting to a point now where
my kids,

44:20.566 --> 44:22.598
like, the exciting thing when you
get in,

44:22.598 --> 44:24.574
like, when I got in that car with
you,

44:24.574 --> 44:26.614
is just the speed of it, you
know, the speed and the power,

44:26.614 --> 44:29.574
and all those things, even though
it's a reasonably priced car,

44:29.574 --> 44:32.538
and all the cars that you drive,
always really exciting,

44:32.538 --> 44:34.626
and now the most exciting thing when
I get in my car is that my kids are

44:34.626 --> 44:38.562
at an age where they can all do
their own seat belts.

44:38.562 --> 44:39.618
Oh, what a day that was!

44:39.618 --> 44:43.582
It was like clunk, clunk, clunk,
clunk, clunk, let's drive, yes!

44:43.582 --> 44:45.538
It was a good day.

44:45.538 --> 44:47.618
All right, what do you think, shall
we take a look at your timed lap?

44:47.618 --> 44:51.538
- Yeah, OK. - Come on. - I mean, it's the
taking part that counts, isn't it?

44:51.538 --> 44:52.598
- That's what they say. - Oh...

44:52.598 --> 44:55.530
- Well, how do you think it went?
- I think it was all right,

44:55.530 --> 44:56.558
I think it went OK.

44:56.558 --> 44:58.546
I lost a couple of socks, but...

45:00.586 --> 45:02.626
It's a fast car,
what can I tell you?

45:02.626 --> 45:04.558
All right, let's take a look.

45:07.562 --> 45:08.602
OK, off the line.

45:08.602 --> 45:11.546
Right, kids, I think we're going to
make it for nine o'clock.

45:12.550 --> 45:13.554
Strap in!

45:15.574 --> 45:17.546
Eyebrows up or down? I never know.

45:17.546 --> 45:19.622
Up? No, down.

45:19.622 --> 45:21.586
Down's better. Down is better.

45:23.542 --> 45:25.622
Running wide, a bit of understeer
there from the GT86.

45:25.622 --> 45:29.578
200 horsepower, rear-wheel drive,
Toyota Prius rear tyres.

45:30.590 --> 45:32.598
That looked quite quick, coming into
Chicago.

45:32.598 --> 45:34.550
Watch the car pitching there.

45:36.530 --> 45:39.550
Oh, my goodness, that was like
hugging me nana!

45:39.550 --> 45:40.554
It was so nice!

45:42.546 --> 45:44.582
This is the longest I've driven
without shouting,

45:44.582 --> 45:46.530
"Stop hitting your sister!"

45:47.562 --> 45:49.598
Again, the direction change into
Hammerhead,

45:49.598 --> 45:52.598
crucial to get on the gas early now,
power it out, look at that,

45:52.598 --> 45:54.550
using all the circuit, that's good.

45:54.550 --> 45:57.530
Let it come out... Oh, now you've
gone down the middle of the track,

45:57.530 --> 45:58.618
- not so helpful. - Oh, my goodness.

45:59.626 --> 46:01.590
Oh, this is the wrong time to need
a wee.

46:01.590 --> 46:03.610
Oh, we don't want to know about
your weeing stories.

46:06.566 --> 46:08.582
Oh, my gosh, it's 90mph!

46:08.582 --> 46:10.530
Sheezus!

46:12.622 --> 46:15.574
We didn't see any brake lights,
which is very, very good.

46:15.574 --> 46:18.586
OK, you're all right, kids,
we're going to make it,

46:18.586 --> 46:20.538
we're going to make it for PE!

46:22.534 --> 46:23.626
What's he going to be like through
Gambon,

46:23.626 --> 46:25.610
is he going to take all the kerb?

46:25.610 --> 46:29.538
A bit of understeer, oversteer
on the exit, great showboating!

46:29.538 --> 46:30.582
Whoo!

46:33.530 --> 46:34.618
It's all right.

46:34.618 --> 46:36.562
Yeah.

46:37.574 --> 46:39.562
There it is, the leaderboard.

46:39.562 --> 46:42.598
- Where would you like to be?
- Well, I'd love to, I mean,

46:42.598 --> 46:44.554
I'm looking at the comics, really.

46:44.554 --> 46:46.554
Ross Noble, I know he rides
motorbikes,

46:46.554 --> 46:47.590
so I'm nowhere near there.

46:47.590 --> 46:49.578
- And he's crazy. - And he's crazy.

46:49.578 --> 46:54.530
I'd like to beat Rob Brydon, but I
just really want to beat Lee Mack.

46:54.530 --> 46:56.542
- That's my aim there. - All right.

46:56.542 --> 46:59.530
- OK, come on. - Jason Manford,

46:59.530 --> 47:01.534
you went around our humble
little track...

47:01.534 --> 47:02.538
Come on...

47:02.538 --> 47:04.578
- ..in one minute... - That's good.

47:04.578 --> 47:05.622
- ..40... - Oh!

47:07.534 --> 47:09.546
- .6! - Oh, yes, I'll take that,
lovely!

47:13.602 --> 47:15.542
I told you you'd be good.

47:15.542 --> 47:17.550
Thanks, man, that was great,
oh, wow.

47:17.550 --> 47:19.598
You've nailed them all.

47:19.598 --> 47:21.558
- I'll take that. - That's mega.

47:25.542 --> 47:29.530
- Thanks, guys, thank you.
- Jason Manford, everybody, come on!

47:29.530 --> 47:30.562
Whoo!

47:35.538 --> 47:37.586
Now, you'll remember earlier in
the show,

47:37.586 --> 47:40.594
we were testing three SUVs by
pretending

47:40.594 --> 47:42.626
they were horses, obviously.

47:42.626 --> 47:46.582
You will also remember that the
Velar had won the first challenge,

47:46.582 --> 47:50.558
obviously. But things were about to
get serious.

47:57.598 --> 48:01.542
Back at the inaugural Top Gear
SUV horse trials,

48:01.542 --> 48:05.574
it was time for our final challenge,
the infamous cross-country.

48:06.610 --> 48:10.622
A gruelling off-road course around
the grounds of one of Britain's

48:10.622 --> 48:13.590
finest stately homes.

48:13.590 --> 48:17.550
- Is that Downton Abbey?
- This is Burghley, OK?

48:17.550 --> 48:19.622
Built by the Cecil family in
the 16th century.

48:19.622 --> 48:21.598
It's not Downton, Burghley.

48:21.598 --> 48:23.574
Whatever. How's the car?

48:23.574 --> 48:25.586
- Fixed the problem?
- Oh, we fixed the problem.

48:25.586 --> 48:28.554
Nice. Washed it too, I see.

48:28.554 --> 48:29.558
Yep.

48:32.550 --> 48:34.618
That's a D5. Yesterday it was a T5.

48:34.618 --> 48:36.582
We had a slight issue with the T5.

48:36.582 --> 48:39.530
Uh-huh. So you got a new car?

48:39.530 --> 48:41.566
- We got a new car. - What was wrong
with the other one?

48:41.566 --> 48:43.550
Nothing much, the engine nearly
fell out.

48:43.550 --> 48:45.530
OK.

48:45.530 --> 48:47.578
So he replaced his car, are
you all right with that?

48:47.578 --> 48:50.542
- No! - All right, that solves that.

48:50.542 --> 48:54.550
Here we go. It sure looks like
Downton Abbey.

48:54.550 --> 48:57.542
So, with one Volvo on its way to
the glue factory,

48:57.542 --> 48:59.574
Chris was now driving a diesel too,

48:59.574 --> 49:02.602
making mine the only petrol car
left in the running.

49:02.602 --> 49:06.534
Let's go and have a race at a
stately home.

49:06.534 --> 49:08.578
Ahead of us lay a torturous course,

49:08.578 --> 49:12.590
featuring everything you'd expect
from horse-themed off-roading,

49:12.590 --> 49:16.546
including high-speed gallops,
technical handling zones,

49:16.546 --> 49:19.618
undulating terrain and
deep wading water.

49:19.618 --> 49:23.618
This would be a challenge for even
the hardiest steed.

49:23.618 --> 49:25.626
And having lost out in the
arena round,

49:25.626 --> 49:28.570
Matt would be starting at the back
of the grid...

49:29.594 --> 49:33.622
..in a car with no off-road pedigree
whatsoever.

49:33.622 --> 49:37.626
All right. I guess I'll start us off
since this is still my film.

49:37.626 --> 49:40.594
- OK. - The winner is ready to go.

49:42.606 --> 49:45.538
I mean, seriously.

49:45.538 --> 49:47.538
Dynamic mode.

49:47.538 --> 49:48.566
High performance.

49:48.566 --> 49:51.558
OK. Three,

49:51.558 --> 49:52.622
two, one...

49:52.622 --> 49:54.594
Go!

49:57.606 --> 50:00.578
- Let's go! - Get out of the way.
- Come on, Velar!

50:02.554 --> 50:04.530
He's on it. Rory is on it.

50:06.538 --> 50:09.614
I'm tearing it up. I've got by far
the best car,

50:09.614 --> 50:11.606
by far the most torque.

50:11.606 --> 50:15.586
Some people have questioned whether
the Velar is a real Range Rover,

50:15.586 --> 50:17.598
whether it's all glam, no grip.

50:17.598 --> 50:19.562
No way.

50:23.570 --> 50:26.570
It has all of Land Rover's fancy
off-road tech.

50:26.570 --> 50:28.546
That means it's capable.

50:29.578 --> 50:30.622
It is proper stuff.

50:30.622 --> 50:31.626
Water splash!

50:31.626 --> 50:33.530
Oh...

50:36.594 --> 50:38.534
I can't see!

50:42.530 --> 50:43.626
But I can see that I'm winning!

50:46.610 --> 50:49.606
It just feels like we've broken into
a stately home and just started

50:49.606 --> 50:50.626
dragging around!

50:52.590 --> 50:55.590
Is there another way to look
this good,

50:55.590 --> 50:58.554
going this quickly in this field?

50:58.554 --> 50:59.558
I think not.

50:59.558 --> 51:00.562
Whoa, whoa!

51:01.614 --> 51:03.578
- He's missed a turn. - Oh, man!

51:04.582 --> 51:06.530
I don't know where he's going.

51:06.530 --> 51:07.598
See you later, Rory.

51:07.598 --> 51:10.622
- Back it up, back it up. - With the
Velar kindly stepping aside...

51:10.622 --> 51:11.626
Bollocks!

51:14.530 --> 51:15.594
Come on! Chase them down!

51:15.594 --> 51:16.598
Chase them down!

51:17.606 --> 51:20.546
..it was time to go hunt some Volvo.

51:20.546 --> 51:22.590
Oh, yeah! It's wide open now.

51:25.562 --> 51:28.610
- OK, Chris, I've got my eye on you.
- Oh, not so fast.

51:31.574 --> 51:32.606
Don't let them get away!

51:34.590 --> 51:35.594
That is bumpy.

51:38.538 --> 51:40.622
Come on, come on! I'm coming to get
you, Harris.

51:40.622 --> 51:41.626
That's tight.

51:43.550 --> 51:44.570
Matt's right behind me!

51:45.582 --> 51:47.530
Where did they go?

51:48.530 --> 51:49.534
Where did they go?

51:51.594 --> 51:53.534
I'm going right! I'm going right!

51:54.598 --> 51:57.558
With Rory heading off into the
great unknown...

51:58.574 --> 52:03.554
..it would now be a two-horse race
for the next oddly familiar section

52:03.554 --> 52:04.598
of the course.

52:06.602 --> 52:07.614
A tyre wall?

52:11.542 --> 52:14.550
Right-hander...Chicago.
They've made...

52:14.550 --> 52:15.618
Hey, this is Dunsfold.

52:15.618 --> 52:17.598
Yep.

52:17.598 --> 52:19.562
It was time for a gallop.

52:22.550 --> 52:23.614
All right, Harris, here I come.

52:25.622 --> 52:27.622
Look at this, braking into
Hammerhead.

52:29.550 --> 52:31.558
Wait, wait, wait! Right there!

52:33.562 --> 52:34.570
Come on!

52:35.598 --> 52:37.554
He's not going to wait now.

52:37.554 --> 52:38.594
Cheeky swine!

52:41.626 --> 52:43.554
He's quick through here.

52:43.554 --> 52:45.530
Look at that Alfa horsepower.

52:46.558 --> 52:47.598
Whoa!

52:47.598 --> 52:49.566
This isn't at Dunsfold.

52:56.570 --> 52:58.530
CHRIS LAUGHS

52:58.530 --> 53:00.554
He missed the bale

53:00.554 --> 53:02.614
by a gnat's pubic hair then!

53:05.626 --> 53:07.582
SHEEP BLEAT

53:07.582 --> 53:08.614
Where the hell are they?

53:10.586 --> 53:11.622
God, there's sheep in here.

53:14.530 --> 53:17.562
I have literally no idea where I am.

53:19.618 --> 53:22.610
We, on the other hand, had cleared
Dunsfold.

53:22.610 --> 53:25.578
And across the flatter section of
the course,

53:25.578 --> 53:28.618
the more powerful Stelvio had built
a lead.

53:28.618 --> 53:31.574
This thing is all Italian muscle.

53:32.602 --> 53:35.530
But then the flat stuff ran out.

53:37.562 --> 53:40.606
I don't know who ploughed this
field, but I think he was hammered.

53:40.606 --> 53:42.614
And the Volvo made a comeback.

53:46.550 --> 53:48.534
Full lock!

53:48.534 --> 53:49.538
In fourth gear!

53:50.626 --> 53:53.542
It's good off-road, this thing.

53:53.542 --> 53:55.586
We're slightly beyond the
design plan, though.

54:03.578 --> 54:04.622
That was a massive moment!

54:06.562 --> 54:07.574
Jeez!

54:09.586 --> 54:11.606
Chris is gaining! Chris is gaining!

54:11.606 --> 54:13.602
I'm closing on him.

54:13.602 --> 54:16.622
Six furlongs, five furlongs, four...

54:18.558 --> 54:19.594
I don't know what a furlong is.

54:19.594 --> 54:21.626
- What is a furlong?
- Oh, he's right there!

54:21.626 --> 54:23.546
That was shady.

54:27.566 --> 54:29.534
I can't finish second.

54:30.586 --> 54:32.570
I've got to win this. It's my film.

54:33.606 --> 54:38.546
Our cross-country challenge was
proving to be a close fought battle.

54:38.546 --> 54:39.610
Well, for two of us.

54:41.618 --> 54:43.598
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

54:43.598 --> 54:44.602
Sorry!

54:46.610 --> 54:47.614
Awkward!

54:50.546 --> 54:51.550
Sorry!

54:52.578 --> 54:54.622
Meanwhile, back in the race,

54:54.622 --> 54:57.594
we were heading into the last leg
of the course.

54:57.594 --> 55:00.590
Harris had the lead but was now
fighting hard

55:00.590 --> 55:02.598
with his own car.

55:02.598 --> 55:05.534
Oh, my God!

55:07.550 --> 55:10.578
Look at that Volvo buck! Guy's nuts!

55:11.590 --> 55:13.598
Who says we don't do serious car
reviews?!

55:14.606 --> 55:17.546
The finish line was getting close.

55:17.546 --> 55:18.622
Where's the house? Where's the big
house?

55:20.538 --> 55:23.594
And our SUV horse trial was getting
increasingly vigorous.

55:31.598 --> 55:33.570
There it is! There's the house!

55:35.534 --> 55:36.622
Home stretch now.

55:50.610 --> 55:52.566
That is a pretty house.

55:52.566 --> 55:54.566
I'm sure it looks like Downton Abbey
to me.

55:57.602 --> 56:01.530
Rory, meanwhile, had had enough of
exploring the countryside...

56:02.622 --> 56:04.550
Move!

56:04.550 --> 56:06.534
Stupid birds!

56:06.534 --> 56:08.538
..and was finally back on track.

56:09.594 --> 56:11.554
There's the house.

56:11.554 --> 56:13.570
Chase these guys down, Reid.

56:13.570 --> 56:14.622
To catch the pack, though...

56:14.622 --> 56:17.626
- I need a short cut.
- ..he would need the Velar to show...

56:17.626 --> 56:19.586
This will do, this will do.

56:19.586 --> 56:21.626
..some of that Land Rover grit.

56:21.626 --> 56:23.578
I'm not stopping. I'm not stopping!

56:25.570 --> 56:27.566
I can see 'em.
Oh, I'm back in the game!

56:29.562 --> 56:30.578
I'm on your tail!

56:30.578 --> 56:31.582
Oh, yeah!

56:33.570 --> 56:35.622
Close the gap, close the gap,
close the gap, baby!

56:35.622 --> 56:37.610
Close it, close it, close it,
close it!

56:37.610 --> 56:42.550
With Rory closing in fast,
Chris was in trouble.

56:42.550 --> 56:43.594
RATTLING AND GRINDING

56:43.594 --> 56:45.614
Oh, my God, that's a terrible noise.

56:48.618 --> 56:50.546
Chris has got a problem.

56:50.546 --> 56:51.626
Chris has got a problem!

56:51.626 --> 56:53.530
I don't believe it.

56:54.554 --> 56:55.622
He broke another Volvo.

56:58.538 --> 57:00.534
I think I might have jumped it a
bit too high.

57:00.534 --> 57:01.538
Sorry, Volvo.

57:03.606 --> 57:05.558
It sounds terrible.

57:05.558 --> 57:07.558
Wading through the final obstacle,

57:07.558 --> 57:11.550
Matt was now galloping towards the
finish line, odds-on for the win.

57:11.550 --> 57:12.626
What a hero!

57:14.594 --> 57:15.598
Time to get wet.

57:17.602 --> 57:21.550
And having now injured my second
Volvo,

57:21.550 --> 57:24.614
it was all I could do to keep
this one in second place.

57:24.614 --> 57:27.574
That's a terrible, race-losing
noise.

57:28.602 --> 57:30.530
Way to go, baby!

57:32.550 --> 57:33.578
I mean, that's just a joke.

57:36.554 --> 57:37.614
There's the gate, there's the gate.

57:40.542 --> 57:43.562
All I can see is Rory in the Velar.

57:43.562 --> 57:44.586
There's the finish line.

57:44.586 --> 57:48.546
I got it! I got this one in the
bag, baby!

57:48.546 --> 57:51.546
- Come on. - I can see him,
I can see him.

57:51.546 --> 57:53.542
Catch him, catch him, catch him,
catch him!

57:53.542 --> 57:54.582
Come on, Volvo, you can do it!

57:56.570 --> 57:58.578
Home, sweet home.

57:58.578 --> 58:00.550
Look at that!

58:00.550 --> 58:01.618
Winner!

58:01.618 --> 58:04.622
Winner, Alfa Romeo Stelvio!

58:08.534 --> 58:09.582
No!

58:09.582 --> 58:11.574
Da-da der!

58:11.574 --> 58:12.610
That is fantastic.

58:14.610 --> 58:18.606
I'll take it. I reckon second in
this condition is going some.

58:20.558 --> 58:22.542
Nice. Who knew?

58:23.566 --> 58:27.546
Alfa Romeo, the benchmark of
reliability.

58:29.610 --> 58:32.606
I am so impressed with this
little car, I've got to say.

58:32.606 --> 58:35.590
It's quick, it's nimble,
it's tough as nails.

58:35.590 --> 58:38.570
It's amazing, isn't it? Alfa Romeo
is known for being beautiful but

58:38.570 --> 58:40.594
unreliable. And what you're in is
something that's,

58:40.594 --> 58:44.582
I think the modern parlance is
fugly, but unbreakable.

58:46.602 --> 58:48.586
It is the eye of the beholder,
isn't it?

58:48.586 --> 58:50.610
What about the fake Range Rover?
Sorry, the Velar.

58:50.610 --> 58:53.534
Hey, listen. I might have come last,

58:53.534 --> 58:56.602
but the difference between me and
you is I look good doing it.

59:00.610 --> 59:04.562
I would say that the Alfa Romeo is
a thoroughbred.

59:04.562 --> 59:06.602
The Volvo is clearly a workhorse.

59:08.542 --> 59:11.606
And the Velar is Rory's show pony.

59:11.606 --> 59:12.610
THEY LAUGH

59:14.598 --> 59:16.566
Harsh. Harsh.

59:16.566 --> 59:17.614
He looks great in third place.

59:28.590 --> 59:31.530
Christopher, Christopher,
Christopher.

59:31.530 --> 59:33.602
You know, for a respected motoring
journalist,

59:33.602 --> 59:35.558
you sure do break a lot of cars.

59:35.558 --> 59:37.542
You know I hate breaking cars.

59:37.542 --> 59:38.610
And in my defence...

59:40.538 --> 59:43.598
Let's count.
First you broke a Volvo.

59:43.598 --> 59:47.566
The most peace-loving of all
the cars, yeah?

59:47.566 --> 59:51.558
Then you try to replace the Volvo
without anyone noticing.

59:51.558 --> 59:55.578
Then you set fire to an Alpine,
nearly cooked Eddie Jordan,

59:55.578 --> 59:56.626
then broke another Volvo.

59:56.626 --> 59:58.602
Yeah. What is wrong with you?

59:58.602 --> 01:00:02.566
Hang on. We've established the
Alpine wasn't my fault, yeah?

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:04.602
Did you see the engine mountings on
that Volvo?

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:06.550
Little aluminium castings.

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:09.622
It's almost as if they never
intended the XC60

01:00:09.622 --> 01:00:13.602
to jump six feet in the air
towing a horsebox.

01:00:13.602 --> 01:00:16.550
You know how many people you have
to murder

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:18.610
to be classified as a
serial killer? Three.

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:22.534
You, my friend, are
a car serial killer.

01:00:22.534 --> 01:00:25.626
What SUV is going to survive that
kind of treatment?

01:00:25.626 --> 01:00:28.570
- Well, the Velar. - And the Stelvio.

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:30.558
Yeah, I'll admit, that is the big
surprise.

01:00:30.558 --> 01:00:33.586
I mean, Alfa used to make
unreliable cars.

01:00:33.586 --> 01:00:36.594
Yeah, well, they still do make
unreliable cars.

01:00:36.594 --> 01:00:37.598
That's not a car.

01:00:38.606 --> 01:00:40.542
That's an SUV.

01:00:40.542 --> 01:00:44.550
So what you're saying is that Alfa
still makes unreliable cars,

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:48.538
but it now makes
indestructible SUVs?

01:00:48.538 --> 01:00:49.594
Exactly.

01:00:49.594 --> 01:00:52.558
So, if you want all the fun of
owning a horse

01:00:52.558 --> 01:00:57.542
with none of the hassle of owning
a horse, buy an Alfa Romeo Stelvio.

01:00:57.542 --> 01:00:59.558
I think our work here is done.

01:00:59.558 --> 01:01:01.610
OK, that's it for tonight and
the series.

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:03.558
We'll be back later in the year.

01:01:03.558 --> 01:01:05.594
Thank you so much for watching.
Goodnight.
