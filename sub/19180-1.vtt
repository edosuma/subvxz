01:12.560 --> 01:13.556
Thank you.

03:23.566 --> 03:25.439
- How long do you stay in Berlin?
- Three weeks.

03:25.526 --> 03:27.435
- How much money do you have?
- Four pounds.

03:27.528 --> 03:28.289
For three weeks?

03:28.341 --> 03:31.157
I'm staying with my brother and
his wife; he should be here somewhere.

03:31.209 --> 03:32.512
Thank you.

03:44.253 --> 03:46.874
- Susanne?
- Bettina.

03:46.964 --> 03:49.751
Hallo, Susanne. Welcome to Berlin.

03:49.842 --> 03:53.575
- Martin was so sorry he couldn't get here.
- So wonderful to see you at last!

03:53.627 --> 03:55.869
He had to be on duty at the hospital.

03:56.265 --> 03:58.872
Come, get your luggage
and we'll start for home.

04:07.276 --> 04:09.316
They are refugees from the East.

04:13.282 --> 04:15.368
You don't speak any German at all?

04:18.495 --> 04:22.077
- What was that?
- Nothing. Money changer. East marks into West.

04:46.190 --> 04:50.651
- I never imagined it like this.
- I wanted to show you something nice first.

04:50.736 --> 04:53.406
They say first impressions last long.

04:58.619 --> 05:00.279
This is the Brandenburger Tor.

05:00.788 --> 05:02.662
It's the East-West frontier now.

05:02.748 --> 05:05.951
- If you cross over there you are in the East.
- The Russian sector?

05:06.043 --> 05:08.202
Don't expect it to be too exciting.

05:08.295 --> 05:12.079
Quite a lot happens every day, but you
only learn it from the newspapers.

05:12.174 --> 05:14.926
- This is near your home?
- Right here; there.

06:16.655 --> 06:21.650
Some people like nothing but to gossip
all day. This is new to me, this style.

06:22.078 --> 06:23.276
It's very attractive.

06:23.788 --> 06:26.954
You think so? I'm still not sure.
I shall leave it to Martin.

06:27.917 --> 06:30.586
So far it's been a week
and he hasn't even noticed it.

06:30.669 --> 06:34.999
- But where is he? Your brother works too hard.
- He always did.

06:35.091 --> 06:38.542
Don't look too closely. Some things
are old, others we have just bought.

06:38.636 --> 06:41.886
- Have you lived here for long?
- Yes, yes, since I was a child.

06:41.972 --> 06:45.638
It's a lot to look after, though.
This is your room in there.

06:47.686 --> 06:50.687
You know, you look much younger
than in your photographs.

06:52.024 --> 06:55.856
Ah, Martin promised to clear his clothes
away this morning before he left.

06:55.945 --> 06:58.732
- Won't he mind being turned out of his room?
- No, no, of course not.

07:09.625 --> 07:12.626
Before, we only had a view
of the houses opposite.

07:12.712 --> 07:16.330
That was all built up, all the way
to the East-West frontier.

07:17.299 --> 07:18.295
Over there.

07:18.384 --> 07:20.626
- It's near, isn't it?
- Near enough.

07:20.720 --> 07:21.799
Susanne...

07:23.931 --> 07:27.715
- Martin!
- Darling, I'm sorry I couldn't get to the airport.

07:27.810 --> 07:29.781
- I got held up at the last minute.
- Oh, that's alright, I managed...

07:29.833 --> 07:32.220
- The plane must have got in right on time.
- Yes, it did!

07:32.314 --> 07:34.556
How smart you look, and grown up, too!

07:34.650 --> 07:36.773
- Thank you for asking me.
- So you found Bettina alright?

07:36.861 --> 07:38.059
Well, we... we found each other.

07:38.154 --> 07:40.561
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

07:40.656 --> 07:41.928
Did you have a good flight?

07:41.980 --> 07:44.488
Oh, it was alright.
I was too excited to pay much attention.

07:44.577 --> 07:46.902
- Did you leave everybody alright at home?
- Yes, they're fine; they all...

07:46.996 --> 07:48.967
Oh, by the way, I've managed
to get this evening off.

07:49.019 --> 07:50.061
We'll all go out somewhere.

07:50.708 --> 07:53.080
Isn't it wonderful that
she's here at last?

07:53.169 --> 07:55.078
Just the three of us together.

09:16.961 --> 09:19.119
- Oh, what a fool! Look what I've done!
- Here, darling, take this.

09:19.213 --> 09:21.455
No, no, I'll ask the lady
in the cloak-room.

09:21.549 --> 09:24.550
I won't be a moment. Why don't you
dance with Susanne in the meantime?

09:24.635 --> 09:26.564
Are you going to insist on dancing?

09:26.616 --> 09:28.597
Not unless you're better
than you used to be.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.575
Do you like it in Berlin?

09:47.627 --> 09:49.452
If I hadn't come,
I shouldn't have met Bettina.

09:49.712 --> 09:51.276
She's lovely, Martin.

09:59.879 --> 10:01.912
Bettina says you work too hard.

10:01.964 --> 10:04.258
Well, the last few weeks
have been a bit of a rush.

10:04.310 --> 10:06.865
The army have lent me to help out at
a refugee camp.

10:06.917 --> 10:10.045
There are one or two cases of typhoid
among the refugees.

10:10.097 --> 10:12.913
I'm afraid I shall be glad when I can
get back to England and practice again.

10:13.434 --> 10:17.083
We passed the Eastern sector today.
We didn't go in, of course, just drove.

10:17.344 --> 10:20.524
- You can go in, you know.
- Really? I must before I go home.

10:20.608 --> 10:22.172
I wouldn't go wondering in alone.

10:24.028 --> 10:25.634
Oh, Susanne wants to see
the Eastern sector.

10:25.686 --> 10:26.937
You'll take her across,
won't you, darling?

10:26.989 --> 10:29.075
Of course, if she wants to see it.

10:29.127 --> 10:31.369
But Martin, I have the most
terrible headache.

10:31.421 --> 10:32.985
You don't mind if I leave you
and go home?

10:33.037 --> 10:34.757
- Darling, I am sorry.
- Oh, it will be alright.

10:34.809 --> 10:35.826
Shall we all go?

10:35.915 --> 10:37.885
Oh, no, it's Susanne's
first night in Berlin...

10:37.938 --> 10:39.449
and you've only seen part of the show.

10:39.502 --> 10:41.796
- Bettina, I don't mind.
- No, of course she doesn't. Herr Ober!

10:41.848 --> 10:43.620
She's probably tired
after the journey, anyway.

10:43.672 --> 10:45.706
I'll take a cab and you can stay!

10:45.758 --> 10:48.417
Martin works so hard;
he hardly ever has an evening off.

10:48.469 --> 10:50.971
Nonsense, darling!
We'd much rather go, really.

10:52.431 --> 10:54.887
Really, we needn't all go.

11:15.246 --> 11:16.870
Susanne.

11:29.051 --> 11:32.337
- Would you like to walk for a bit?
- No, thank you, it's better already.

11:33.639 --> 11:37.090
I think nightclub air must be the same
all over the world.

11:37.184 --> 11:40.684
They probably bottle it and ship it from
country to country.

11:59.123 --> 12:01.614
What was that, a race or a chase?

12:01.709 --> 12:03.748
No, more like a chase.

12:03.836 --> 12:05.959
It looks as if they're heading for
the Tiergartenstrasse.

12:06.047 --> 12:09.166
They'll be there in a moment;
then over the frontier, poor devil.

12:09.258 --> 12:11.666
They've picked up someone over here
who's wanted in the East.

12:11.761 --> 12:14.631
Oh, Martin, Martin, please!

12:15.306 --> 12:17.382
You don't know what happened.
How do you know that?

12:17.475 --> 12:20.853
Sorry, darling, I was just telling
Susanne that sometimes people...

12:20.905 --> 12:22.991
Alright, alright! Don't go on.

12:23.022 --> 12:24.350
I'll go and get the car.

12:29.445 --> 12:31.651
Things like that don't happen everyday.

12:32.198 --> 12:36.065
You'll be bored with Berlin
before you leave. You'll see.

13:20.621 --> 13:22.199
Oh, it's you, Bettina.

13:23.332 --> 13:24.328
Susanne.

13:26.335 --> 13:27.366
What are you doing?

13:27.461 --> 13:29.999
I heard a sort of noise... outside.

13:30.089 --> 13:33.686
Nonsense! You are tired.
Probably over-tired.

13:33.738 --> 13:35.302
I thought I heard something.

13:35.563 --> 13:37.857
Of course, I should have
told you about it.

13:37.909 --> 13:41.559
It's the owl on the ruins of the
Italian Embassy across the street.

13:41.642 --> 13:43.765
- The sound came from the street, didn't it?
- Mhm-hm.

13:43.853 --> 13:46.557
Aren't you cold, dear?
I shall get you another blanket.

14:05.041 --> 14:07.033
I'm sorry you were disturbed.

14:07.126 --> 14:09.165
- Shall I close the window?
- No, I like it open.

14:10.254 --> 14:14.252
I couldn't sleep, and then I started
to worry about the front door.

14:14.341 --> 14:16.215
I didn't want to disturb Martin.

14:16.844 --> 14:19.382
Now get some sleep.
You mustn't be tired tomorrow.

14:21.557 --> 14:24.558
You wanted to see the
Eastern sector... remember?

14:25.519 --> 14:27.144
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:02.431 --> 15:03.985
What are they looking for?

15:04.037 --> 15:06.957
Newspapers, books...
any sort of propaganda.

15:07.009 --> 15:08.469
Also, the Eastern mark is cheaper...

15:08.521 --> 15:11.649
so people try to buy food here
and smuggle it across.

16:13.586 --> 16:15.984
Tell me, if it's so easy
for them to get across...

16:16.036 --> 16:17.704
why don't they go?
I mean, it would seem that it's...

16:17.757 --> 16:20.164
They have homes here, or families, and...

16:21.052 --> 16:22.047
Ivo, Ivo...

16:26.140 --> 16:28.747
- Would you like to move on?
- Yes. - Herr Ober!

17:08.015 --> 17:11.467
My sister-in-law, Miss Mallison,
Mr. Ivo Kern.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.134
So this is the long-expected
visitor from London.

17:14.230 --> 17:18.559
How kind of Bettina to brighten our dull
Eatern sector by bringing you here.

17:19.443 --> 17:20.632
I'm delighted to see, Bettina...

17:20.684 --> 17:23.551
that even your principles
are subject to revision and change.

17:23.811 --> 17:28.243
- Susanne wanted to see the sector.
- Ah, then your views have not changed?

17:29.808 --> 17:33.822
We, Bettina and I, do not see eye-to-eye
about some things:

17:33.874 --> 17:35.543
this part of Berlin, for instance.

17:35.595 --> 17:39.922
But we are old friends, and it is our
privilege to quarrel over little things.

17:39.974 --> 17:41.747
Little things like war and peace...

17:41.799 --> 17:44.197
the division of our country,
the fate of the world.

17:44.260 --> 17:48.672
- Trifles!... You speak German?
- No, I'm sorry.

17:48.764 --> 17:50.850
The German always
had to learn languages:

17:50.923 --> 17:53.060
the army never knew
where it would be going.

17:53.144 --> 17:55.563
We still learn English in our schools...

17:55.615 --> 17:57.700
but it might be rather a waste,
who knows?

17:58.899 --> 18:00.892
What do you think?

18:04.363 --> 18:06.735
- Is this your first visit to Berlin?
- Yes.

18:06.824 --> 18:11.071
- You find it amusing?
- It's sad to see all this destruction.

18:11.162 --> 18:12.620
There isn't much else.

18:12.705 --> 18:14.853
The ruins are now
a familiar part of the city:

18:14.905 --> 18:18.815
the Berliner no longer notices them,
doesn't even see them, isn't that right?

18:19.284 --> 18:22.152
You are a Berliner still,
if no longer in name.

18:22.882 --> 18:27.010
I suppose so. It's a subject
I don't think about very much.

18:28.095 --> 18:29.637
How is your husband?

18:29.722 --> 18:31.798
Fine, he works as usual.

18:32.641 --> 18:34.925
Your brother is a very
exceptional person:

18:34.977 --> 18:36.854
a military man who is also an idealist.

18:36.906 --> 18:38.935
He works too hard.
We're going to try to stop him.

18:39.023 --> 18:41.977
- Admirable. Very sisterly.
- I think we have to go.

18:43.110 --> 18:44.308
Martin will be back.

18:44.403 --> 18:47.357
- I have Eastern marks.
- No, let me pay.

18:47.823 --> 18:51.406
They don't often buy anything
so pleasant as a meeting like this.

18:53.162 --> 18:55.451
What a pity that one ever has
to come out-of-doors.

18:55.539 --> 18:59.323
Inside, with the curtains closed,
it's possible to forget the present,

18:59.418 --> 19:02.817
turn your back to the future and face
the past with hope and confidence.

19:02.870 --> 19:05.998
Well, we'll be going this way
to the frontier. Goodbye.

19:06.509 --> 19:08.073
Goodbye, Bettina.

19:08.344 --> 19:10.534
Miss Mallison, it's refreshing
to speak English again.

19:10.596 --> 19:11.680
If ever you need a guide...

19:11.733 --> 19:15.017
one thoroughly familiar with Berlin
in all its glory, please call on me.

19:15.069 --> 19:17.384
- You have my number, I think?
- Yes, I think so.

19:17.478 --> 19:19.517
I look forward to hearing from you.

19:31.534 --> 19:35.152
You know how it is in large cities:
people don't meet for a long time and...

19:35.246 --> 19:39.113
then quite suddenly run into each other several times.
- Yes, of course.

19:40.251 --> 19:44.248
- What does he do?
- I don't really know nowadays. He had...

19:44.338 --> 19:45.464
We are coming to the frontier.

19:45.516 --> 19:47.445
I think it's better if we don't
speak English now.

19:55.433 --> 19:59.124
Did all these come over from
the East during the weekend?

19:59.176 --> 20:00.740
Yes, just under 3,000.

20:00.855 --> 20:02.894
About twice as many
as we've got accomodation for.

20:03.774 --> 20:09.065
He is waiting for food papers, medical
papers, job papers, Police papers...

20:09.155 --> 20:12.571
all papers; and then... you start again.

20:12.658 --> 20:14.033
Please in here.

20:15.077 --> 20:18.078
- Martin.
- Susanne, what are you doing here?

20:18.164 --> 20:19.874
Bettina asked me to bring you these.

20:19.926 --> 20:22.428
Razor blades? How sweet of her,
but really we've got everything here.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.680
- Sorry.
- Of course.

20:27.631 --> 20:28.841
Yes, alright, I'll wait.

20:28.893 --> 20:31.297
We missed you last night.
We hoped you might manage to get home.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.585
Went into the Eastern sector yesterday...

20:33.679 --> 20:36.170
went into a restaurant
and met a friend of Bettina's.

20:36.265 --> 20:39.100
- Oh, who was it?
- A man named Ivo Kern.

20:39.185 --> 20:41.261
Oh yes, I know:
he's an old friend of Bettina's.

20:41.353 --> 20:43.439
Martin, are you always as busy as this?

20:44.190 --> 20:46.977
It must be so difficult for her.
I wouldn't know how to fill up my days.

20:47.068 --> 20:49.935
Oh, she's alright. She's a Berliner.
She has her friends here.

20:50.654 --> 20:52.481
You don't think you leave
her alone too much?

20:52.573 --> 20:55.657
Perhaps one day people will decide to
fall ill between the hours of 9 and 5.

20:55.743 --> 20:57.451
Things will ease up a bit
in a day or two.

20:57.536 --> 20:58.568
Hello, yes, speaking.

20:59.497 --> 21:01.536
Yes, I wanted to ask you about that.

21:02.249 --> 21:04.207
No, the intake, that's not the point.

21:30.403 --> 21:34.696
- Susanne.
- Ah, there you are! I have been waiting patiently.

21:34.782 --> 21:38.281
- For me? - To offer my services
as a guide, if you are free tonight?

21:38.369 --> 21:40.319
How is Martin? Did you see him?

21:40.371 --> 21:43.499
He may have to stay there tonight,
he said he'd phone you.

21:43.582 --> 21:46.667
If you'll excuse me,
I'll put away my things.

22:06.564 --> 22:10.063
- Were you serious about asking me
to go out with you tonight? - Of course.

22:10.151 --> 22:11.561
What time shall I call for you?

22:11.652 --> 22:13.561
But if Martin doesn't get back,
Bettina...

22:13.654 --> 22:15.196
do you mind if I...?
- No, only we had...

22:15.281 --> 22:18.899
Of course Bettina wouldn't mind.
I can never get Bettina to go anywhere.

22:18.951 --> 22:21.276
I call for you at seven.
Seven o'clock, huh?

22:21.787 --> 22:23.032
Alright. Thank you.

22:26.667 --> 22:27.830
Goodbye, Bettina.

22:29.003 --> 22:29.999
Goodbye, Ivo.

22:32.923 --> 22:34.487
Then I shall see you later, Susanne.

22:34.540 --> 22:37.407
I think you are about young enough
for me to call you Susanne, don't you?

23:24.367 --> 23:27.570
- You dance quite well.
- Thank you.

23:29.789 --> 23:31.829
Have you known Bettina for a long time?

23:34.043 --> 23:36.083
Yes, quite a long time.

23:36.671 --> 23:39.126
Does she speak well of me?

23:39.215 --> 23:42.798
- Not that I heard. Why, did you
think she would? - No, not really.

23:52.145 --> 23:54.376
This is another boring
feature of the place:

23:54.428 --> 23:57.348
people keep telephoning your table
if they take a fancy to you.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.024
I take no notice of it.

24:02.238 --> 24:05.846
- I must seem very rude to you,
asking so many questions. - Not at all.

24:05.898 --> 24:09.078
- Only it's all so strange to me, this
place, these people... - Go on asking!

24:09.162 --> 24:10.870
I don't know what...

24:10.955 --> 24:12.995
Well, tell me something about yourself.

24:15.209 --> 24:19.297
- Perhaps you have an admirer. Would you
like to listen? - No, no, please, no!

24:19.349 --> 24:21.122
Alright, I will.

24:40.193 --> 24:42.814
Crazy people. What were you saying?

24:43.363 --> 24:45.569
I don't know. I was just saying:
tell me about you, your work...

24:45.657 --> 24:47.554
Alright. Which story would
you like to here?

24:47.606 --> 24:49.640
The one about my property
in East Prussia,

24:49.702 --> 24:52.372
for which I'm soon to receive
a huge compensation?

24:52.455 --> 24:55.575
Or the story of my lost
collection of paintings,

24:55.667 --> 24:57.659
for which I'm suing
the French government?

24:58.169 --> 25:00.292
Or about my great deeds
of valour in the war,

25:00.380 --> 25:04.792
which I've already told so many people
that I almost believe it myself.

25:04.884 --> 25:08.964
Or, in your honour, would you like me to
invent something entirely new?

25:10.431 --> 25:12.175
In my honour, why not tell the truth?

25:14.936 --> 25:17.509
The truth passed me by a long time ago.

25:17.605 --> 25:19.513
Then I'll have to go on
asking you questions.

25:19.565 --> 25:21.025
What did you do before the war?

25:24.362 --> 25:26.135
Miss Mallison, Mr. Halendar.

25:26.197 --> 25:27.193
How do you do?

25:30.097 --> 25:33.277
So Miss Mallison,
you are new in Berlin, yes?

25:33.329 --> 25:35.820
Yes, I'm staying with my brother:
he's stationed here.

25:35.915 --> 25:38.916
- You speak German, Miss Mallison?
- I'm sorry, not at all.

25:50.805 --> 25:52.463
We shouldn't keep you from your friends.

25:52.515 --> 25:55.643
Besides, we must go:
Miss Mallison has to go home early.

25:55.727 --> 25:58.478
Oh, no, I'm quite alright.
Bettina's given me the key, and...

25:58.563 --> 26:02.976
- How is Bettina? - Oh, she's very...
Do you know her well?

26:03.067 --> 26:06.602
I met her with Ivo.
Have you seen her lately?

26:08.531 --> 26:09.527
No.

26:10.241 --> 26:13.660
You must get Ivo to take you
to the Opera in the Eastern sector.

26:13.745 --> 26:14.985
It is better than the West.

26:15.038 --> 26:17.801
Let me send you tickets.
I have some influence at the theatre.

26:17.874 --> 26:20.994
- That's very kind of you. Thank you
so much. - Good. What address?

26:21.085 --> 26:23.125
- 8 Bernhardstrasse.
- Thank you.

26:25.256 --> 26:26.403
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

26:39.187 --> 26:42.472
Is that what you do in London,
give your address to strangers?

26:42.565 --> 26:45.934
But I thought he was a friend of yours.
- I've met him a few times.

26:46.027 --> 26:50.198
It was very nice of him. Anyway, I can't
take up all of Bettina's time, can I?

26:50.948 --> 26:52.858
So we're back to that again, are we?

26:52.950 --> 26:56.900
- Why get angry just because I mention Bettina?
- Guilty conscience, no doubt.

26:56.996 --> 26:59.874
Do you have in mind continuing
to investigate me through him?

26:59.926 --> 27:02.481
Don't you want to go on questioning me?

27:03.044 --> 27:05.083
Why don't you leave her alone?

27:06.506 --> 27:09.175
Don't tell me it's none of my business:
Bettina's married to my brother.

27:09.258 --> 27:11.813
Your sisterly concern does you credit,
my dear Susanne.

27:11.865 --> 27:15.515
When you are a little older, if you are
still interested I'll explain it all.

27:15.723 --> 27:19.894
Excuse me, I have some business.
You won't mind if I send you home alone?

27:20.520 --> 27:22.927
- No, not at all.
- Goodnight.

27:57.056 --> 28:01.101
Miss Mallison... Mr. Ivo Kern, he wishes
that you should meet him.

28:01.185 --> 28:04.554
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Please, listen, wait!

28:04.647 --> 28:08.515
Wait! Important, he say...
about Madame Bettina.

28:09.902 --> 28:13.402
- Alright. Where is he?
- I will show you, yes? Please, come!

28:14.824 --> 28:15.820
Come, come.

28:33.226 --> 28:37.389
- If an apology about last night is
of any use... - I didn't come for that.

28:42.360 --> 28:46.572
I've been thinking all night...
about Bettina.

28:47.282 --> 28:50.117
About myself, about what you said.

28:51.953 --> 28:57.167
You were quite right, of course.
I suppose that's what made me so angry.

28:59.502 --> 29:04.413
- I do hate interfering. - I think it
made me see things rather more clearly.

29:04.507 --> 29:08.837
Bettina and I, well, it's one of those
things you drift into.

29:08.928 --> 29:11.680
I didn't ever mean to start
anything serious.

29:12.682 --> 29:15.810
Bettina and I had known each other
for a long time.

29:16.102 --> 29:18.593
We met here again in Berlin.

29:19.397 --> 29:22.102
At first, I didn't even know
she was married.

29:22.192 --> 29:23.816
I'm glad you told me.

29:24.944 --> 29:29.571
- Mind you, there was never anything... You know.
- No, no, of course.

29:29.616 --> 29:30.606
But it was my fault.

29:30.658 --> 29:33.406
I didn't think Bettina would
take it all so much to heart.

29:35.830 --> 29:39.574
I'm making arrangements as quickly as I
can to get away from Berlin altogether.

29:39.626 --> 29:41.190
That'll be the end of it.

29:42.337 --> 29:43.499
Does that make you happy?

29:44.422 --> 29:48.254
- Yes, it does.
- I am happy now that I've told you.

29:48.343 --> 29:50.668
Come, I'll see you home.

29:51.763 --> 29:55.807
- I'd like to tell you that...
- It's not necessary. It's finished.

29:58.311 --> 30:04.349
- I only wanted to say thank you.
- Don't look so sad! Reward me! Smile!

30:12.617 --> 30:14.195
Be down in a moment.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.120
- Too tight?
- No, no, thank you.

30:19.207 --> 30:21.126
You keep on with these tricks
in the Eastern sector...

30:21.178 --> 30:22.690
they're bound to catch you.

30:22.742 --> 30:24.254
Then it'll be your head, not your hand.

30:26.464 --> 30:28.581
You're becoming over-confident.

30:28.633 --> 30:31.709
You should give it up...
before you get into more trouble.

30:31.761 --> 30:33.534
You're getting too old
for this kind of work.

30:33.586 --> 30:35.359
It's always the old dogs that are best.

30:35.431 --> 30:38.219
- It was an old dog that bit me.
- It's too dangerous for you.

30:38.309 --> 30:41.595
They have no suspicion who I am.
They don't connect me with Kastner.

30:41.688 --> 30:43.348
What were you doing this time?

30:43.440 --> 30:45.004
They had some documents
in the Eastern sector...

30:45.056 --> 30:47.298
which were of interest to us
in the West. That was all.

30:47.360 --> 30:51.654
- Bettina? - Susanne, I want you to meet
a great friend of ours, Olaf Kastner.

30:52.907 --> 30:54.366
- Kastner.
- You cut yourself?

30:54.451 --> 30:56.786
- A dog bit him. - This one happened not
to be man's best friend.

30:57.829 --> 30:59.080
I'll get lunch ready.

30:59.132 --> 31:01.843
Oh, do you mind not for me?
I'm going skating with Ivo.

31:01.916 --> 31:04.294
Ivo? Oh, Ivo Kern.
That's your friend isn't it, Bettina?

31:04.346 --> 31:06.536
Yes, yes, someone I knew here years ago.

31:07.297 --> 31:09.903
He seems to have taken
quite a fancy to Susanne.

31:10.185 --> 31:12.792
I can't for the life of me think why.

31:13.303 --> 31:16.754
- Oh, Bettina, will you lend me your
skates again? - Yes, of course.

31:29.277 --> 31:32.942
Susanne, you are going out
with Ivo again?

31:34.073 --> 31:37.110
- Don't you think I should?
- It's not important.

31:37.702 --> 31:41.830
Only you mustn't get too fond of Berlin.
It's a long way from London.

31:43.583 --> 31:45.291
Only five hours by plane.

31:47.337 --> 31:51.287
Susanne, I've known Ivo a long time ago.

31:51.674 --> 31:54.657
I don't know much about
what he has become, or...

31:54.917 --> 31:58.045
if he is the kind of person
you should be with a great deal.

31:59.057 --> 32:02.260
He's always very correct with me
if that's what you mean.

32:06.481 --> 32:10.313
There isn't a great difference
between our ages, Susanne,

32:10.401 --> 32:13.770
but there's a hundred years
between the way we've lived.

32:15.115 --> 32:17.819
Why doesn't Martin mind
my going out with Ivo?

32:23.498 --> 32:25.906
I'll get you the skates.

32:28.878 --> 32:31.286
- Let me know if it gives you any trouble.
- Goodbye.

32:31.381 --> 32:35.379
- Bye, Miss Mallison.
- Goodbye, Olaf.

32:35.468 --> 32:38.968
You'll never catch him on skates,
Susanne. Tell him you're an heiress.

32:47.188 --> 32:50.225
- Goodbye, Miss Mallison.
- Oh, do you know Mr. Ivo Kern?

32:50.316 --> 32:52.938
Excuse my hand: I had an accident.

32:53.903 --> 32:57.272
- Bad?
- No, no, nothing. Just playing with a dog.

32:57.365 --> 32:58.731
Can we give you a lift?

32:58.783 --> 33:01.546
Thank you so much, Miss Mallison:
only going around the corner.

33:01.619 --> 33:02.900
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

33:39.824 --> 33:43.774
Oh... Excuse me, it's Halendar.

33:55.924 --> 33:58.841
While you are skating and waltzing
my office is in an uproar.

33:58.927 --> 34:01.085
The business with Kastner
must be finished.

34:01.179 --> 34:05.093
- Kastner again? What's happened now?
- This morning he appeared in the East

34:05.183 --> 34:08.748
...in the unform of one of our
own Generals with a staff car...

34:08.801 --> 34:11.563
and helped two of our Police officers
to escape into the West...

34:11.616 --> 34:15.391
with a van-load of records and documents,
the most damaging kind of things.

34:15.443 --> 34:17.235
- Are you sure it was Kastner?
- Who else?

34:17.320 --> 34:20.985
Besides, there was a row at the
frontier. Nobody could identify him...

34:21.074 --> 34:23.451
but I'm told one of the dogs
got him by the hand.

34:23.503 --> 34:25.014
He fought loose and got away.

34:25.067 --> 34:27.413
What's more, the dog went
after him and didn't come back.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.967
The dog knows which side
has the best food.

34:30.020 --> 34:32.783
Yes, yes, yes, I can see
how it amuses you.

34:32.835 --> 34:36.583
Kastner comes and goes, taking our
people from right under our noses...

34:36.672 --> 34:40.505
and for all our efforts we still
don't even know what he looks like.

34:40.592 --> 34:42.793
You say one of the dogs got Kastner?

34:42.846 --> 34:45.922
Yes, yes, yes, I told you:
by the hand, but he got away.

34:47.016 --> 34:50.800
Yes, so he did.
Well, perhaps his luck will break.

34:50.895 --> 34:53.386
How is it you favour Miss Bettina
and now with this girl?

34:53.481 --> 34:56.315
Has your heart been touched?
That could be dangerous!

34:56.400 --> 34:59.521
You have the contacts.
Kastner is a friend of that family.

34:59.612 --> 35:03.361
If not the wife, then the sister.
But somehow, Ivo, it must be done.

35:03.450 --> 35:05.359
Would you like me to drop it altogether?

35:05.452 --> 35:09.698
That would be most unwise, Ivo,
most unwise.

35:11.916 --> 35:15.202
What's the manuscript?
Is that the story of your life?

35:15.295 --> 35:20.040
Not mine: yours. I was hoping you
wouldn't make it necessary, Ivo, but...

35:20.133 --> 35:23.042
"The post-war activities of Ivo Kern...

35:23.094 --> 35:26.170
in the British and American
zones of Germany."

35:26.222 --> 35:30.600
It's quite a long report: your work with
forged and stolen passports in Munich;

35:31.019 --> 35:33.426
the diversion and sale
of American petrol;

35:33.521 --> 35:36.191
illegal firearms business in Dusseldorf;

35:36.274 --> 35:38.563
the American Major's wife, etc., etc.

35:38.651 --> 35:41.605
Please, you'll spoil it for me.
I want to read it myself.

35:41.696 --> 35:44.261
You have until the end
of the week for this.

35:44.313 --> 35:47.076
Either you succeed or this goes
to the Russian police.

35:47.911 --> 35:51.560
Of course, it only means that you can
never again set foot in the West;

35:51.612 --> 35:54.198
that you'll remain permanently
with us in the East.

35:54.292 --> 35:58.835
Permanently in the East with you.
Enchanting.

35:58.922 --> 36:02.248
For you to arrange this meeting
has been quite expensive.

36:02.300 --> 36:05.950
Do you suppose they don't ask me
to account for the money I spend?

36:06.054 --> 36:07.252
Wait here for a while.

36:08.807 --> 36:10.431
You are going to get a bargain.

36:17.482 --> 36:21.017
You know that fellow we met
outside your house today?

36:27.617 --> 36:30.618
When you leave, why not take the boy?
Give him a chance.

36:33.123 --> 36:35.578
It's difficult enough to get myself out.

36:35.667 --> 36:38.621
I have everything I need.
All but one thing:

36:38.711 --> 36:41.381
a guarantee of an employ
in the Western zone.

36:46.219 --> 36:47.215
What is it?

36:48.012 --> 36:51.713
- If only I'd thought of it this morning.
- Well, what?

36:51.808 --> 36:56.055
That fellow we met, your brother's
friend, the one with the injured hand.

36:56.146 --> 36:59.349
- Didn't you say his name was Kastner?
- Kastner, yes.

36:59.441 --> 37:04.731
I thought I recognised him! Now he's a
man with a lot of influence in the West.

37:06.239 --> 37:08.113
Ah, well, it doesn't matter.

37:08.783 --> 37:11.737
But how could he help you, Ivo?

37:11.828 --> 37:15.759
For him it will be quite easy: he has
business contact, official contact...

37:15.811 --> 37:18.053
contact with all the people who matter.

37:19.586 --> 37:22.373
But don't you worry:
this is my problem.

37:22.464 --> 37:24.361
- But this man is a great
friend of Martin's. - Please!

37:24.413 --> 37:27.385
Why shouldn't he arrange
for you to meet him?

37:33.766 --> 37:36.471
- She's not back yet?
- No, no she isn't.

37:36.561 --> 37:38.055
I wouldn't worry.

37:48.673 --> 37:52.173
- I'll talk to Martin now.
- Oh, forget that! We were just talking.

37:53.095 --> 37:56.261
- We weren't. We were planning.
- I shall think of something.

37:56.348 --> 38:00.346
Don't be silly.
I wouldn't mind asking a favour of you.

38:00.435 --> 38:01.999
I wish you would.

38:02.594 --> 38:05.200
If this works out alright,
you'll be leaving soon, won't you?

38:06.858 --> 38:11.567
Susanne, I think I should leave
as quickly as possible.

38:12.030 --> 38:14.402
- Don't you?
- I don't know.

38:14.741 --> 38:17.869
Well, we'll let the Fates decide, huh?

38:18.662 --> 38:22.197
I'll call you as soon as Martin
makes the appointment.

38:22.290 --> 38:24.912
There never was such a persistent girl!

38:26.586 --> 38:28.745
- Goodnight, Ivo.
- Goodnight.

38:38.223 --> 38:39.254
Is that you, Susanne?

38:39.349 --> 38:41.306
- Hello, Martin.
- Have a good time?

38:41.393 --> 38:42.508
Wonderful, thank you.

38:50.277 --> 38:52.649
- Martin, you like Ivo, don't you?
- Yes, he's alright.

38:52.738 --> 38:54.938
He wants to get out of the
Eastern sector. In fact...

38:54.990 --> 38:57.962
he wants to get out of Berlin
altogether and work in the West.

38:58.910 --> 39:01.117
And we met Mr. Kastner
coming out of the house.

39:02.247 --> 39:04.536
He said he was the very person
who could help him with...

39:04.624 --> 39:08.040
letters of introduction...
guarantees and so on.

39:08.628 --> 39:10.502
Yes, I dare say he could.

39:10.589 --> 39:12.664
Could you ask him over
to the house so that...

39:12.716 --> 39:14.645
Ivo could meet him and talk about it?

39:14.718 --> 39:16.426
I don't see why not.

39:16.803 --> 39:18.920
Martin, you wouldn't phone him now,
would you?

39:18.972 --> 39:20.275
Yes, sure, of course I will.

39:26.229 --> 39:27.688
I wouldn't do that.

39:28.523 --> 39:29.519
No.

39:30.150 --> 39:32.024
He won't mind. I can try at any rate.

39:32.944 --> 39:33.940
No!

39:34.029 --> 39:37.030
Ivo wants to get out of Berlin
and Mr. Kastner can help him.

39:37.616 --> 39:40.556
Let Ivo look after himself:
he's had plenty of practice.

39:40.608 --> 39:42.642
You had no right to make
any such promise!

39:43.580 --> 39:46.395
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it really doesn't matter all that much. If Ivo wants...

39:46.458 --> 39:48.700
I say you mustn't telephone!
I won't have it!

39:48.794 --> 39:51.082
Darling, what is the matter
with you lately?

39:53.590 --> 39:55.102
Oh, I expect I'm to blame.

39:55.467 --> 39:59.012
That's the first sensible word
you've said since you came here.

39:59.096 --> 40:00.628
And if you don't understand
what you've done...

40:00.680 --> 40:03.183
it's because you're incapable
of understanding anything.

40:03.266 --> 40:06.351
- It was you who introduced me to Ivo.
- Yes, and then what happens?

40:06.436 --> 40:09.971
He smiles at you; he says he will
take you skating; you jump with joy.

40:10.065 --> 40:13.434
You think, "He is a roué!
Where's my Paris hat?" and off you go.

40:13.527 --> 40:15.069
And what do you know about him?
Nothing.

40:15.153 --> 40:18.818
- Except he's a friend of yours.
- Shall I tell you about Ivo?

40:18.907 --> 40:22.490
Your precious Ivo?
Your charming escort?

40:22.577 --> 40:24.487
- He's a kidnapper
- Really...!

40:24.579 --> 40:27.664
Yes: a kidnapper! He steals people.

40:30.168 --> 40:34.296
For weeks he has been tormenting me,
trying to force me to get Olaf here.

40:34.381 --> 40:37.964
He's been driving me mad with...
with pleas and threats.

40:38.051 --> 40:40.459
I've tried to warn you!
I've tried to tell you!

40:40.554 --> 40:42.345
But why didn't you tell me about this?

40:46.893 --> 40:49.645
I know what you suspected.
I know what you thought of me.

40:49.730 --> 40:53.264
I want you to hear this...
You knew I was married before.

40:56.236 --> 40:59.687
Martin, it was Ivo I was married to.

41:00.949 --> 41:01.945
Ivo?

41:03.535 --> 41:05.693
And now I suppose
I'm still married to him.

41:08.290 --> 41:10.375
I hadn't seen Ivo since '43.

41:11.063 --> 41:13.983
He was reported missing in France
and then he was thought to be killed.

41:14.421 --> 41:18.335
Martin and I had his death certified
so that we could be married.

41:20.719 --> 41:26.010
Then, three weeks ago...
he appeared... from nowhere...

41:26.099 --> 41:30.393
from the ruins of Berlin...
with a new name.

41:30.479 --> 41:31.865
I wanted to tell you at once.

41:31.918 --> 41:33.899
You can't have been afraid
to come and tell me?

41:33.982 --> 41:37.814
No, but... but he persuaded me
that it would harm you...

41:37.903 --> 41:39.946
that it would ruin your army career...

41:39.999 --> 41:42.897
if they found out that you were living
with a woman who is not your wife.

41:44.159 --> 41:49.402
The army would separate us. They
would send you away. I would lose you.

41:50.415 --> 41:55.492
Once he had planted the fear,
he started to talk about Olaf Kastner.

41:55.587 --> 41:58.956
He told me that he was
working for them in the East.

41:59.049 --> 42:03.378
He said I must get Kastner here.
I knew what that meant.

42:03.512 --> 42:08.725
They would leave together and Kastner
would be taken in the street.

42:08.975 --> 42:14.189
If I haven't been very sensible,
darling, it's... it's because I love you.

42:15.816 --> 42:20.145
And it's because I wanted
to protect you from all this dirt.

42:23.198 --> 42:25.304
Anyway, I thought we'd better
come and tell the Police...

42:25.356 --> 42:27.077
just what the position is.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.782
We are generally called in
only when it is too late.

42:29.871 --> 42:33.371
It is remarkable how few people
trust the Police in any country.

42:33.458 --> 42:36.513
And since Ivo Kern is so
eager for a meeting...

42:36.566 --> 42:38.651
it would be a pity
to disappoint him, eh?

42:39.673 --> 42:43.124
The young lady will telephone;
she will say that it is all arranged;

42:43.635 --> 42:46.138
invite him to come for
a drink before lunch;

42:46.732 --> 42:48.452
I will personally shake the cocktails.

42:48.515 --> 42:49.974
How do you think they'll
try and get him?

42:50.058 --> 42:53.558
They will not make any attempt
in the house of a British officer.

42:53.645 --> 42:56.219
Anyway, they have no idea
what I look like.

42:56.898 --> 42:59.453
To identify me, they will
need your friend:

42:59.505 --> 43:01.017
the chap I met with you yesterday.

43:01.069 --> 43:01.983
Ivo Kern?

43:02.070 --> 43:05.071
Yes, they will try and grab me
as I leave your house with him.

43:05.157 --> 43:08.193
And be perfectly casual,
just as always.

43:10.579 --> 43:12.618
Better do as he says, Susanne.

43:13.206 --> 43:16.410
Pity. He seems like a nice fellow.

43:18.503 --> 43:21.707
- Would you do it?
- It's no use asking me.

43:21.798 --> 43:24.799
He wouldn't listen to me.
I can't help you, Susanne.

43:26.178 --> 43:27.636
You must decide for yourself.

43:27.721 --> 43:32.964
Facts we deal in, not pretty pictures
of loyalty and sentiment, young lady.

43:33.602 --> 43:36.389
Our friend Kastner here has
many times risked his life...

43:36.480 --> 43:39.053
crossing to the East to rescue people
whose lives are in danger...

43:39.149 --> 43:41.683
and is all the time supplying
us with information...

43:41.735 --> 43:43.403
that is invaluable to the West.

43:43.487 --> 43:46.896
Since you've been used
in their trick to identify him...

43:46.948 --> 43:49.972
can you refuse to help us
at a moment like this?

43:50.035 --> 43:52.407
Remember: casual, ordinary.

44:02.172 --> 44:03.666
Take it. Please.

44:06.218 --> 44:07.593
Please!

44:07.677 --> 44:09.385
Susanne, really!

44:18.772 --> 44:21.061
- Hello.
- Hello, Ivo? Is that you?

44:21.149 --> 44:22.181
Hello? Yes.

44:23.777 --> 44:28.688
I've spoken to Martin. He's asking Mr.
Kastner over for a drink before lunch.

44:28.782 --> 44:32.150
Would you like to come?

44:32.244 --> 44:35.944
Good. Fine. Yes, I'll be there.

45:12.409 --> 45:16.454
No sign of them in the neighbourhood.
My men have circled the entire area.

45:16.538 --> 45:18.029
I wish he had been punctual.

45:18.081 --> 45:20.844
I had an appointment for lunch
at 1 o'clock. It's nearly 2.

45:20.917 --> 45:23.325
They have been warned off somehow,
eh, Inspector?

45:23.420 --> 45:26.125
Those are your men, the labourers
clearing rubble across the street?

45:26.214 --> 45:29.583
They were working so hard, they knew
they couldn't be real labourers.

45:30.552 --> 45:33.719
Bettina, I'm sorry to be such
a bother: all this to-do.

45:56.703 --> 46:01.080
Did you speak to him?
Does he know anything more about us?

46:01.166 --> 46:04.795
It's pretty much as he said:
we're not married.

46:04.847 --> 46:06.671
It makes it all rather
romantic, doesn't it?

46:07.339 --> 46:11.206
- Please, not so near the window!
- He worries about me all the time.

46:11.301 --> 46:14.440
If he had his way, I would have
armed guards, Police protection...

46:14.492 --> 46:15.482
and a bullet-proof car.

46:15.555 --> 46:17.046
They've told me what you do.

46:17.099 --> 46:19.549
Oh, perhaps it's been exaggerated.
One just comes and goes.

46:19.601 --> 46:22.851
Ah, splendid! After all,
I was invited here to have a drink.

46:22.938 --> 46:26.141
- You'd like a whisky? Water or soda?
- Just water please.

46:26.233 --> 46:28.272
- Martin, how about you?
- Not for me, thanks.

46:32.072 --> 46:33.187
He's not coming.

46:35.117 --> 46:37.193
What's that you say? Why?

46:37.744 --> 46:39.571
He's not going to come.

46:40.706 --> 46:45.721
I know those marks down there: he has
a boy on a bicycle who spies for him.

46:45.773 --> 46:47.024
He's not going to come.

46:47.087 --> 46:49.370
Of course he spies for them.

46:49.423 --> 46:52.551
Where do you think a boy
like that gets a bicycle?

46:52.634 --> 46:55.001
A new one. Out of pocket-money?

46:55.595 --> 46:58.347
Alright, he's fooled us this time.
But I'll still get him.

46:59.933 --> 47:03.717
Maybe it will be better
if you don't go out alone...

47:03.812 --> 47:05.888
the next two days. Be careful.

47:34.426 --> 47:37.491
What difference is it
going to make to us?

47:37.544 --> 47:40.150
Now that you know we are
not properly married?

47:41.433 --> 47:44.849
I'll have to take more care of you,
make sure I don't lose you.

47:45.896 --> 47:50.588
You could send me away if you want to.
You are free to do as you like.

47:50.650 --> 47:53.497
Somehow, they'll have to arrange
that we're not separated...

47:53.549 --> 47:54.853
and get married again.

47:56.323 --> 48:00.494
You have to ask me first.
Come on, Martin.

48:01.370 --> 48:02.777
Will you, Bettina?

48:03.789 --> 48:07.454
I don't know.
I have to think about it.

48:10.754 --> 48:13.541
I thought I'd go over to BEA
to see about my return ticket.

48:16.051 --> 48:19.669
- I'm sorry, Susanne.
- Stay a little longer, won't you, Susanne?

48:19.763 --> 48:21.802
I'll come back again when I...

48:23.183 --> 48:24.558
Bye. I won't be long.

50:11.867 --> 50:16.908
The fools! I should like to come
with you and see you make your report.

50:16.997 --> 50:20.375
"Please, sir, I have kidnapped
the wrong woman."

50:20.428 --> 50:22.409
You will certainly get
promotion for this.

50:22.461 --> 50:26.209
You've made yourself famous at last:
another International Incident...

50:26.298 --> 50:28.706
the sister of a British Army officer!

50:28.801 --> 50:32.216
What next? Perhaps the wife of the
French Ambassador to keep her company?

50:32.367 --> 50:33.826
Be quiet!

50:38.227 --> 50:39.770
It was a terrible mistake.

50:39.822 --> 50:43.889
A very reasonable explanation.
It could have happened to anyone.

50:43.941 --> 50:46.858
There was no need for it to happen
if you had done your job.

50:46.944 --> 50:51.606
So you thought that if you could
kidnap my wife, without my permission,

50:51.698 --> 50:55.696
you could intimidate her into helping
you to get Kastner. Was that it?

50:55.786 --> 50:57.496
I have had enough of your pleading...

50:57.548 --> 50:59.633
and debating the moral issues
with your wife.

50:59.706 --> 51:03.241
I would have given her a few simple
orders and she would have obeyed.

51:03.335 --> 51:06.289
She is a German woman no matter
whom she has married since.

51:24.731 --> 51:27.982
- Does he know anything yet?
- No, he knows nothing.

51:28.819 --> 51:29.815
Not yet.

52:06.690 --> 52:08.922
Such people, they say nothing.

52:08.974 --> 52:11.059
Have you made your confession
and been forgiven?

52:11.111 --> 52:13.353
I told him nothing and he said nothing.

52:13.405 --> 52:15.803
That must have been a very
interesting conversation.

52:16.700 --> 52:20.780
Let me clear up the mess you have made.
You will have to turn the girl loose.

52:20.871 --> 52:22.330
Let me take her back for you.

52:24.333 --> 52:26.372
I may still get Kastner.

52:27.252 --> 52:31.961
If I must turn the girl loose,
a few hours won't make any difference.

52:32.049 --> 52:33.840
Stay here a moment.

52:33.926 --> 52:37.626
What new and more brilliant blunder
are you meditating now?

52:37.721 --> 52:41.386
Another failure will hardly
make things worse for me.

52:41.475 --> 52:45.722
A little success on the other hand
may change the situation altogether.

52:47.981 --> 52:51.896
You're tired.
I'd get some sleep if I were you.

53:06.323 --> 53:07.522
Miss Mallison?

53:08.147 --> 53:10.233
Thank heaven I have found you!

53:12.923 --> 53:14.334
How do you feel?

53:15.384 --> 53:17.740
Well, I wasn't hurt,
but I'm not in a very good temper.

53:17.792 --> 53:19.774
I have just heard what happened.

53:19.847 --> 53:24.555
I want to help you if I can.
It was a mistake, such things happen.

53:24.643 --> 53:28.344
- What are you going to do?
- Only one thing: to get you out of here.

53:28.439 --> 53:32.732
Now I want to get you home, but I can't
take you through the frontier myself.

53:32.818 --> 53:35.356
Someone from the West must do that.

53:35.446 --> 53:39.739
Just write a note to your sister-in-law;
say you are in trouble,

53:39.825 --> 53:42.281
but a friend... a friend is helping you...

53:42.369 --> 53:46.912
and he will see that you will be outside
the Opera at the end of the performance,

53:47.666 --> 53:50.833
and ask her if someone
can come to fetch you.

53:53.881 --> 53:56.585
And in a few hours
you will be safe at home!

53:57.718 --> 54:01.668
What do you want?
My brother? My sister-in-law?

54:01.764 --> 54:04.255
My dear Miss Mallison,
I am trying to help you.

54:04.975 --> 54:08.391
- Kastner, is that it?
- Oh, such imagination!

54:08.479 --> 54:10.518
You think he'll come for me!

54:17.029 --> 54:19.734
What do you think will happen to you
when people hear what you've done?

54:19.823 --> 54:22.388
There has been no complaint
from the authorities.

54:22.440 --> 54:24.422
Perhaps no one saw what happened to you.

54:24.995 --> 54:29.491
- There'll have a pretty good idea by now.
- Berlin is a strange, large city.

54:29.583 --> 54:33.581
There are many reasons why a young girl
should simply vanish from the streets.

54:33.670 --> 54:36.308
Especially one who has already
shown a tendency...

54:36.361 --> 54:39.124
to make rash and unsavoury friendships.

54:39.218 --> 54:43.262
Believe me, what I am suggesting
is for your own good.

54:45.265 --> 54:49.215
- I'm sorry but I don't believe you.
- Very well.

54:50.521 --> 54:52.560
You're not going to let me go?

54:52.648 --> 54:54.712
Not for the time being.

54:54.764 --> 54:58.518
Knock on the door when you have changed
your mind: someone will hear you.

55:04.284 --> 55:07.486
I will risk it and take her back.
The girl will only make trouble for you.

55:07.538 --> 55:08.737
I am used to trouble.

55:08.820 --> 55:09.988
I will take her off your hands...

55:10.040 --> 55:12.485
and put her across the frontier
at the Brandenburger Tor.

55:12.501 --> 55:14.540
Or just a little bit further, eh?

55:15.573 --> 55:18.434
You have in mind, perhaps,
presenting yourself in the West...

55:18.486 --> 55:20.828
as the heroic rescuer of this girl.

55:20.843 --> 55:24.742
No, my friend. My way will work.
Leave it to me.

55:50.172 --> 55:53.873
- I want to talk to you, Susanne.
- Is it about leaving Berlin?

55:53.968 --> 55:57.917
- Making a new life somewhere else?
- So you wanted to play with fire, huh?

55:58.013 --> 56:00.464
Cheap thrills you get
only in an amusement park.

56:00.516 --> 56:02.445
Next time ride a roller-coaster!

56:02.518 --> 56:04.374
You don't frighten me. It's true!

56:04.426 --> 56:06.146
You don't think I'm still
going to believe you?

56:06.199 --> 56:09.355
You know now what there is to be known
about me. I won't waste time on that.

56:09.441 --> 56:11.933
But believe me, today
they were after Bettina.

56:11.986 --> 56:14.905
I knew nothing of it.
They don't trust me here anymore.

56:14.957 --> 56:18.565
- They probably have their reasons.
- You were taken by mistake.

56:18.659 --> 56:22.360
Yes, yes, it's true. Not even Halendar
would dare to do this to a foreigner.

56:22.454 --> 56:26.271
- Then he'll have to let me go.
- He failed in the attempt to get Kastner.

56:26.333 --> 56:28.252
Poor Halendar, he is desperate.

56:28.304 --> 56:30.233
By bringing you here he
made a serious blunder.

56:30.296 --> 56:33.000
Perhaps too serious for him
to acknowledge. Do you understand?

56:33.591 --> 56:36.960
It would be convenient, most
convenient, if you simply disappeared.

56:37.052 --> 56:39.092
He is surprisingly good
at making such arrangements.

56:48.564 --> 56:52.644
I'm not trying to frighten you,
this is the truth. Listen to me, please!

56:53.402 --> 56:56.853
Halendar is convinced that a word from
you will bring Kastner into the East.

56:56.947 --> 56:58.334
You haven't the nerve to keep me here.

56:58.386 --> 57:00.419
If you were in the hands of the
Government, that would be true.

57:00.472 --> 57:02.244
Halendar is not the government;
neither am I.

57:02.296 --> 57:05.060
He is just a gangster out to get
what he can from any source.

57:05.122 --> 57:07.666
- How could you think that...
- If you do what Halendar asks...

57:07.718 --> 57:09.543
and agree to be outside
the Opera tonight,

57:09.595 --> 57:12.619
I will instantly send word to Kastner
to stay away, that it is a trap.

57:12.671 --> 57:15.539
This will be our chance:
I will get you away.

57:15.591 --> 57:18.041
I am not such an idiot as to pretend
that I would do this for your sake.

57:18.093 --> 57:19.501
It is for my own sake!

57:20.304 --> 57:22.795
- Why? Is there a reward?
- Reward?

57:24.350 --> 57:27.791
Halendar has dug up the records
of certain difficulties I've had...

57:27.843 --> 57:31.179
with the Police in the West.
He is blackmailing me with them.

57:31.232 --> 57:34.308
I must do something to prove
my good intentions to the West.

57:34.360 --> 57:37.091
What you might call active remorse.

57:37.196 --> 57:39.260
If I return you to the
bosom of your family...

57:39.313 --> 57:41.450
this will help me quite a bit
with the Police over there.

57:41.534 --> 57:45.697
They will take a more lenient view
of my case. That is my motive.

57:45.788 --> 57:48.243
At least it sounds selfish enough
to be true.

57:48.332 --> 57:52.460
I need this glory! I will not allow
Kastner to take it away from me.

57:53.254 --> 57:56.204
If I did agree to be outside
the Opera tonight...

57:56.257 --> 57:58.759
how do I know you'd stop
Kastner from coming?

57:58.811 --> 58:00.592
You lied too well before.

58:01.804 --> 58:03.428
Believe me now.

58:36.422 --> 58:40.170
When Kastner comes, our men are waiting
for him. They're watching every street.

58:42.177 --> 58:45.428
- Better get the girl out here now.
- Good.

59:29.934 --> 59:31.843
At least tell me what I'm to do.

59:57.419 --> 59:59.578
The big grey saloon is Halendar's.

01:00:00.214 --> 01:00:02.752
The man in the front seat
is one of his guards.

01:00:03.842 --> 01:00:08.339
When I give you the signal to go,
don't stop to think; don't hesitate; go.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:11.348
And keep going: no matter what happens
around you, keep going.

01:00:16.105 --> 01:00:20.055
- When? At least tell me when!
- About the time the Opera ends.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.942
Just keep your eyes open.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:31.431
- Listen! - It seemed unusually
long tonight, didn't it?

01:03:04.365 --> 01:03:08.445
You didn't say goodnight
to Herr Halendar. He will be furious.

01:03:08.536 --> 01:03:09.531
Look!

01:03:21.257 --> 01:03:25.385
- I really thought you were being arrested.
- How sweet of you to worry.

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:34.219
I've never tried these spikes before.
It's one of our tricks.

01:03:56.292 --> 01:03:58.201
It seems to work very well.

01:04:00.379 --> 01:04:03.250
And now, permit to present
Herr Letz and Herr Vollmer.

01:04:03.341 --> 01:04:04.336
How do you do.

01:04:05.343 --> 01:04:07.715
They looked quite like
real Policemen, didn't they?

01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:16.891
Here is the border. Young lady,
better you do not speak English now.

01:04:16.979 --> 01:04:19.601
A-ha, looks as if they
were expecting us.

01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:25.609
There's a smell of Halendar in this.

01:04:26.947 --> 01:04:30.067
There are lots of other roads.
He can't have tied up everything yet.

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:52.343
Careful now. Potsdamer Platz.

01:05:08.406 --> 01:05:11.940
I will take a look. Don't run away.

01:05:53.576 --> 01:05:55.390
It's no good here.
They are checking everybody...

01:05:55.442 --> 01:05:57.371
so I've told them to get
to Horst's grandmother.

01:05:57.455 --> 01:06:00.906
She has a job at the new building in
the Frankenstrasse. They can hide there.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.491
- What about us?
- We take the train: it goes across.

01:06:59.629 --> 01:07:00.881
Here we should go separately.

01:07:00.933 --> 01:07:04.165
You stay on this side and watch me
so that you know where to turn.

01:07:05.698 --> 01:07:07.904
Alright?

01:07:07.992 --> 01:07:11.942
I didn't think I should ever
be sorry to see you go.

01:07:12.705 --> 01:07:13.950
And don't hurry.

01:07:46.489 --> 01:07:47.485
No thank you.

01:09:02.314 --> 01:09:04.859
We will join the others where
they're putting up that new building.

01:09:04.911 --> 01:09:05.849
Are you hungry?

01:09:05.902 --> 01:09:08.872
- Not a bit. - The boy's grandmother
will give us something to eat.

01:09:08.925 --> 01:09:11.115
She runs a sausage-stand
for the workers.

01:09:39.894 --> 01:09:41.933
They will be able to hide us.

01:10:03.576 --> 01:10:05.401
The other two haven't
turned up yet in the car...

01:10:05.453 --> 01:10:08.216
but she knows someone who
has a motorcycle and a sidecar.

01:10:12.252 --> 01:10:14.743
Quite soon you will be safe at home.

01:10:17.382 --> 01:10:20.169
I said some things to you... before...

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:23.510
The things you said about me
were quite true. They still are true.

01:10:24.222 --> 01:10:25.218
I'm sorry.

01:10:25.306 --> 01:10:27.465
Don't be confused by gratitude.

01:10:32.897 --> 01:10:37.144
- Should I be grateful?
- I suppose not, really.

01:10:39.404 --> 01:10:41.859
Soon I will have to say goodbye to you.

01:10:41.948 --> 01:10:45.613
I suppose I can't ask you
to hold me in good memory.

01:10:46.244 --> 01:10:48.367
But sometimes it was quite nice,
wasn't it?

01:10:49.372 --> 01:10:53.619
- You weren't lying all the time,
were you? - No, not all the time.

01:10:54.627 --> 01:10:58.495
I had a terrible conscience when I found
out that you knew the truth about me.

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:01.447
Since the war, I had forgotten that
people like you existed.

01:11:01.499 --> 01:11:03.897
I tried to get out of it, but...

01:11:04.637 --> 01:11:09.299
It wasn't so easy making that telephone
call. I am glad you didn't come.

01:11:11.269 --> 01:11:13.178
Will we ever go skating again,
do you think?

01:11:13.855 --> 01:11:16.975
I don't believe the prisons
have ice-rinks.

01:11:18.401 --> 01:11:22.565
Well, I'll have to start practicing in
England, perhaps you may come over.

01:11:25.158 --> 01:11:28.858
- I nearly did go to England once.
- You did?

01:11:28.953 --> 01:11:32.998
Our plans were altered.
The war, you remember?

01:11:34.584 --> 01:11:37.371
I suppose you were about
ten years old at the time.

01:11:38.421 --> 01:11:42.253
No, I don't think skating in England
is for us, Susanne.

01:13:59.687 --> 01:14:02.439
- Susanne, you are going with Vollmer.
- What about him?

01:14:02.524 --> 01:14:06.224
- Kindly restrain your humanitarian instincts.
- Why?

01:14:07.028 --> 01:14:11.275
Won't it help you with the
Western Police if he gets through?

01:14:11.366 --> 01:14:13.738
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

01:14:14.452 --> 01:14:15.697
I don't want to go.

01:14:16.496 --> 01:14:17.955
Alright, suit yourself.

01:14:38.351 --> 01:14:40.807
They will never get away
in these lights.

01:14:44.524 --> 01:14:49.601
Such a wonderful machine. To think that
it produces all the electric lighting!

01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:04.955
Do you speak English?

01:15:07.881 --> 01:15:10.419
I will try to get him around
the other side.

01:15:10.508 --> 01:15:11.593
When you hear me shout...

01:15:11.645 --> 01:15:14.773
I want you to take something heavy
and smash some part of this.

01:15:14.846 --> 01:15:17.882
This is very beautful:
try to look pleased.

01:15:23.771 --> 01:15:25.314
Here is the fuel pipe.

01:15:26.524 --> 01:15:28.683
This is a wonderful part
for you to smash.

01:16:24.666 --> 01:16:29.126
- Do you have a head for heights?
- Oh, no. I'm not very good at heights...

01:16:52.068 --> 01:16:55.900
The next building, over the roof!
Don't show yourself.

01:18:08.311 --> 01:18:12.143
What's the matter? It's quite safe.
Come on, quickly!

01:19:01.898 --> 01:19:04.568
Don't faint now:
you'll spoil everything.

01:19:04.651 --> 01:19:07.438
- But I heard a shot.
- Don't worry about me.

01:19:07.529 --> 01:19:11.443
I was born to hang. Horst must take
a message to your brother.

01:19:11.533 --> 01:19:15.400
We can't chance it again tonight. In
the morning traffic it will be easier.

01:19:16.413 --> 01:19:17.476
Go to Major Mallison.

01:19:17.528 --> 01:19:20.292
Tell him to send a car or a van of
some sort first thing in the morning.

01:19:20.344 --> 01:19:24.462
A van will be better. We will be
somewhere within these three streets.

01:19:24.546 --> 01:19:29.089
But the van must circle the area slowly.
I will find some way to signal.

01:19:29.175 --> 01:19:32.129
I could ride out on my bicycle, no?

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:37.297
No. Tomorrow you must go to school.
No more letters of excuse.

01:19:37.976 --> 01:19:40.348
It is necessary for a boy
to go to school.

01:19:41.313 --> 01:19:42.308
Do you hear?

01:19:45.567 --> 01:19:49.066
- I will see you again?
- Of course.

01:19:49.154 --> 01:19:52.274
And don't worry
if I should be busy for a little while.

01:19:52.365 --> 01:19:56.280
- If you need anything, go to Miss
Susanne. - Yes, Horst. Come to see me.

01:20:07.088 --> 01:20:11.715
Go on, Horst! Deliver the message.

01:20:32.739 --> 01:20:36.653
He's young, you see, he's only a boy.
He takes life seriously.

01:20:37.327 --> 01:20:38.655
He's very fond of you.

01:20:39.663 --> 01:20:42.948
- Isn't he?
- A boy like that feels lonely.

01:20:46.211 --> 01:20:49.081
He attaches himself to someone.
It is natural.

01:20:50.298 --> 01:20:53.050
You hate the feeling of being
loved or needed, don't you?

01:20:55.387 --> 01:20:57.426
- Are you cold?
- No, not really.

01:20:58.974 --> 01:21:02.425
Come here. They are even starting
to have Russian winters here.

01:21:02.978 --> 01:21:04.388
It's warm by the chimney.

01:21:08.733 --> 01:21:10.975
It embarrasses you...

01:21:11.027 --> 01:21:13.791
to have people who are fond of you
and don't mind showing it.

01:21:15.282 --> 01:21:18.952
I have lived too long without
these Western luxuries.

01:21:19.004 --> 01:21:21.872
Anyhow, I can't afford
the responsibility.

01:21:23.415 --> 01:21:25.324
Are you in love with Bettina?

01:21:33.884 --> 01:21:35.426
I have forgotten.

01:22:51.461 --> 01:22:52.624
Lock the door.

01:22:57.217 --> 01:22:58.759
For her this is good money.

01:22:58.843 --> 01:23:02.888
This is nothing. I talk English:
I took a course.

01:23:02.973 --> 01:23:04.764
So, it's you two they are hunting?

01:23:04.849 --> 01:23:06.351
They've already seen you downstairs.

01:23:06.403 --> 01:23:08.280
They won't search here.
Maybe they won't even come in.

01:23:08.332 --> 01:23:11.460
You can keep the money and
in the morning I'll give you 500 marks.

01:23:11.523 --> 01:23:14.559
The times I've been promised
money in the morning.

01:23:14.651 --> 01:23:16.152
Where do you want me to put you?

01:23:16.205 --> 01:23:18.029
Under the bed?
There's no place here to hide!

01:23:18.113 --> 01:23:20.428
- Please. - Take your money and get out.
I don't want trouble with them!

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.731
Please! Just while they
pass this floor...

01:23:21.783 --> 01:23:25.015
or you can leave us here: you go
outside and we will take our chances.

01:23:31.459 --> 01:23:32.954
It's a little late for that.

01:23:33.044 --> 01:23:36.496
If they find us here, they must think
you have been hiding us.

01:23:40.176 --> 01:23:42.216
In the morning I will
give you some more.

01:23:49.728 --> 01:23:50.807
Come on, come on, quick!

01:23:52.230 --> 01:23:54.055
For the girl this is impossible.

01:23:54.107 --> 01:23:56.401
I'll take care of her.
Go on out, quickly.

01:24:08.455 --> 01:24:11.491
No, not you. Come on:
take your coat off.

01:24:47.025 --> 01:24:48.589
Be smoking!

01:25:54.736 --> 01:25:56.729
Come on in!
Unless you like it out there.

01:26:10.794 --> 01:26:13.057
What about that little
money you promised me?

01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:14.412
You shall have it in the morning.

01:26:14.506 --> 01:26:16.602
- Yes, but I always...
- We must stay here now.

01:26:16.654 --> 01:26:19.052
This room has been searched already:
now it is safe.

01:26:19.136 --> 01:26:21.757
- I run a cash business.
- You have to trust me.

01:26:21.847 --> 01:26:25.216
Yes, please... Ah, no!

01:26:25.308 --> 01:26:28.096
- That's a good idea. - I won't take...
- Pleading won't do any good at all.

01:26:28.186 --> 01:26:32.018
Alright. If you don't get through,
you won't need it anymore.

01:26:32.107 --> 01:26:36.401
And if you do, you can trust me
to give it back to you.

01:26:36.486 --> 01:26:38.603
Well, the place is all yours.

01:26:38.655 --> 01:26:42.044
Take good care of the furnishings.
They are priceless antiques.

01:26:43.076 --> 01:26:44.487
Are you going to er...?

01:26:49.916 --> 01:26:54.578
What I mean to say is er...
will you be er...?

01:26:55.672 --> 01:26:59.800
Oh, no! I have a friend
who's glad of company.

01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:14.441
Do we stay here all night?

01:27:14.941 --> 01:27:18.070
Unless she decides to turn us in
for a better price.

01:27:18.153 --> 01:27:22.103
Of course, she might get drunk
and start to babble; but otherwise...

01:27:30.457 --> 01:27:32.334
I know it's not elegant here.

01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:36.056
I know these are not your
accustomed surroundings.

01:27:36.129 --> 01:27:39.997
- I wish I could have got a suite.
- Or connecting rooms?

01:27:41.093 --> 01:27:45.090
That's right. But we shall have
to stay here until the morning.

01:27:46.890 --> 01:27:48.717
I'm not complaining. It's fine.

01:27:49.393 --> 01:27:51.136
Tomorrow you...

01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:10.906
Tomorrow you will be back in your own
room: a schoolroom or whatever it is.

01:28:11.665 --> 01:28:15.413
Why don't you put your feet up and rest?
Allow me?

01:28:44.906 --> 01:28:45.986
Come sit here.

01:28:46.616 --> 01:28:48.905
No, I'm... I'm quite alright, really.

01:28:51.288 --> 01:28:52.284
What are you thinking?

01:28:54.666 --> 01:28:56.125
Nothing, really.

01:28:57.502 --> 01:29:01.452
- Tell me, please.
- Don't you ever get sleepy?

01:29:12.809 --> 01:29:18.598
The things you were supposed to have
done, the things Halendar knew about,

01:29:19.649 --> 01:29:21.476
where they very bad?

01:29:27.032 --> 01:29:30.282
I do ask a lot of questions, I know.
Martin's always telling me about that.

01:29:30.369 --> 01:29:33.903
My respect for Major Mallison
is now sky-high.

01:29:35.665 --> 01:29:39.746
Yes, they were bad.
They were true, too.

01:29:39.836 --> 01:29:41.963
Nevermind how or why. I did them.

01:29:42.016 --> 01:29:45.144
No one can explain them away,
least of all myself.

01:29:46.510 --> 01:29:48.301
What did you do before the war?

01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:52.932
That's another question, isn't it?

01:29:55.352 --> 01:29:56.976
I was a lawyer.

01:29:59.398 --> 01:30:01.189
Why did you give it up?

01:30:01.274 --> 01:30:06.102
I didn't. One day the law
simply vanished.

01:30:07.114 --> 01:30:11.491
I came out of the law university with my
head crammed with ideas of Justice,

01:30:11.576 --> 01:30:14.447
the Rights of Man, Trial by Jury,

01:30:14.538 --> 01:30:17.455
the Protection of the Innocent:
all that nonsense.

01:30:17.541 --> 01:30:19.397
And before I could even
open an office...

01:30:19.449 --> 01:30:22.786
it was all as ancient and outmoded
as the bow and arrow.

01:30:23.588 --> 01:30:24.683
Were you in the Army?

01:30:25.027 --> 01:30:29.302
From the beginning I was an efficient
unit of the Military Machine.

01:30:29.386 --> 01:30:32.921
Whatever orders were given to me,
I carried out, promptly.

01:30:34.057 --> 01:30:36.299
Aren't you going to ask me
what I did as a soldier?

01:30:37.853 --> 01:30:38.848
No.

01:30:38.937 --> 01:30:41.891
I took part in the plunder
of Holland and France.

01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:44.808
I saw hostages executed.

01:30:46.194 --> 01:30:49.010
I was ordered to a village in Prague...

01:30:49.062 --> 01:30:52.242
which we levelled to the dust
with everything in it.

01:30:55.996 --> 01:30:57.656
That shocks you, huh?

01:30:59.583 --> 01:31:00.662
You were ordered?

01:31:03.003 --> 01:31:04.378
I was ordered.

01:31:06.923 --> 01:31:12.510
I did not invite you to set yourself up
as my Judge and Saviour. I am innocent.

01:31:12.596 --> 01:31:17.471
I tell you this to explain
why I don't practice the law.

01:31:17.559 --> 01:31:20.239
How could I stand up in the court now,

01:31:20.291 --> 01:31:23.315
adjust my gown and prattle
about the Rights of Man?

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:33.148
You see, little Susanne, it isn't safe
to ask questions of people.

01:31:35.077 --> 01:31:38.196
Why don't you forget about it
and try to get some sleep?

01:31:41.291 --> 01:31:45.075
- I think I understand.
- Understand what?

01:31:46.713 --> 01:31:49.963
Some of the things you've done
since the war.

01:31:50.050 --> 01:31:54.095
Nonsense! I never worried
about what was to come.

01:31:54.763 --> 01:31:58.346
Therefore my life lacks
what some people call its purpose.

01:31:59.935 --> 01:32:04.597
No, the truth is, I didn't have the
stamina or the courage to live decently.

01:32:05.607 --> 01:32:07.351
I understand, Ivo.

01:32:08.568 --> 01:32:12.234
No, you don't understand.
I've told you before...

01:32:12.781 --> 01:32:17.158
that I did this... simply to help myself
with the Police, for no other reason.

01:32:18.745 --> 01:32:22.529
If you had no selfish motive, would you
really have left me there with Halendar?

01:32:25.377 --> 01:32:30.069
Yes. You and Bettina. Your whole family.

01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:33.164
Kastner... the lot of you.

01:32:34.845 --> 01:32:37.003
Thank you, Ivo.
That's all I wanted to know.

01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:44.350
Are your feet cold?

01:32:45.063 --> 01:32:48.191
Yes. And my hands are cold.

01:32:49.276 --> 01:32:51.233
But your heart is the coldest of all.

01:32:51.778 --> 01:32:54.239
I can warm your feet for you.

01:32:54.291 --> 01:32:57.107
It's a pity you can't do
anything about my heart.

01:32:58.452 --> 01:33:02.284
- I could try.
- Why should you bother?

01:33:04.791 --> 01:33:06.700
You must get some sleep now.

01:33:07.961 --> 01:33:11.081
I'll put this around your feet.

01:33:12.215 --> 01:33:16.545
- Ivo, when you get out of prison...
- Yes?

01:33:19.222 --> 01:33:21.262
Will there be anyone who could help you?

01:33:22.351 --> 01:33:24.999
Perhaps in Western Germany
there'll be friends,

01:33:25.051 --> 01:33:27.449
certain persons I have
known a long time ago.

01:33:28.857 --> 01:33:32.402
No, Ivo. Not ones you knew
in earlier days.

01:33:32.454 --> 01:33:34.279
I mean who can help you really.

01:33:34.363 --> 01:33:35.643
You know what I mean.

01:33:37.115 --> 01:33:40.401
No, little girl,
such persons there will not be.

01:33:42.287 --> 01:33:44.778
When you get to the West
I'll help you; so will Martin.

01:33:44.873 --> 01:33:49.416
No you will not. You will take
the first plane back to London.

01:33:50.087 --> 01:33:52.756
And go on with your rich and happy life.

01:33:54.424 --> 01:33:55.800
I'm not rich.

01:33:57.094 --> 01:34:01.138
Any shelter from life
is unattainable wealth.

01:34:06.728 --> 01:34:08.270
What are you thinking of?

01:34:10.107 --> 01:34:11.102
Us.

01:34:14.861 --> 01:34:15.857
You and I.

01:34:20.450 --> 01:34:24.282
You mustn't. You're a child.

01:34:27.416 --> 01:34:29.076
I'm not a child.

01:34:48.846 --> 01:34:53.508
There was one thing more: he said
that I should ride ahead on my bicycle.

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.305
It may be just another trick
to get hold of you.

01:34:56.395 --> 01:34:59.479
No, I believe him.

01:35:00.858 --> 01:35:04.191
- You shouldn't go.
- He's telling the truth.

01:35:04.278 --> 01:35:07.729
You have done very well.
Now run away home and get some sleep.

01:35:08.866 --> 01:35:11.055
But surely this is a matter
for the Police!

01:35:11.107 --> 01:35:14.236
That means their Police too, and their
Police will deny the whole story.

01:35:14.288 --> 01:35:16.790
We have no proof of anything
happening to your sister...

01:35:16.842 --> 01:35:19.658
and the only satisfaction we would get
would be 2 weeks of argument.

01:35:19.710 --> 01:35:20.596
No, I'll go myself.

01:35:20.669 --> 01:35:22.709
- And I'll go with you.
- But you couldn't help me.

01:35:22.796 --> 01:35:27.043
You would be only in the way. Look,
I have done this kind of matter before.

01:35:27.134 --> 01:35:28.676
And Ivo?

01:35:30.262 --> 01:35:31.721
Will you bring him too?

01:35:35.059 --> 01:35:39.305
- I think that will be necessary.
- And then?

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:43.978
That is not our problem.

01:35:44.068 --> 01:35:48.065
The main thing is your sister-in-law
must go back to England at once.

01:35:49.239 --> 01:35:53.319
And... as for Ivo...

01:35:55.996 --> 01:36:00.824
Well, we will think of something.

01:36:01.585 --> 01:36:02.664
Now I must go.

01:36:19.144 --> 01:36:20.140
Not yet.

01:36:20.979 --> 01:36:24.728
- Hm?
- No sign of the van yet.

01:36:27.194 --> 01:36:29.270
It's quite early though.

01:36:29.363 --> 01:36:31.402
No need to worry.

01:36:32.408 --> 01:36:34.815
Yesterday I tried to have you arrested.

01:36:36.829 --> 01:36:39.746
It might have been a less
complicated solution.

01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:43.494
It'll come, don't worry.

01:36:47.256 --> 01:36:48.252
Here it is.

01:37:05.733 --> 01:37:09.730
- Olaf Kastner! You?!
- Uh? Well, what's the matter?

01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:13.568
Now who is going to believe that I had
anything to do with getting you out?

01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:17.119
Get in, both of you, with the laundry.
I promised Bettina and Martin...

01:37:17.171 --> 01:37:19.621
I would have you washed, dried,
ironed and delivered by 7 o'clock.

01:37:19.705 --> 01:37:20.701
School!

01:37:24.543 --> 01:37:25.539
School!

01:37:30.299 --> 01:37:32.872
- Come on.
- Which way do you go?

01:37:32.968 --> 01:37:36.254
There's lot of Police at Potsdamer
Platz. I have got my own way.

01:37:36.346 --> 01:37:37.342
Well, good luck.

01:37:49.651 --> 01:37:53.601
The smell of clean laundry:
what a luxury!

01:37:54.782 --> 01:37:57.699
It's usual to have clean linen
on your honeymoon.

01:38:02.498 --> 01:38:07.836
Every week will seem as long as a year,
every day as long as a week.

01:38:09.046 --> 01:38:12.249
At that rate we will be quite old
when we meet again.

01:38:13.217 --> 01:38:15.615
I shan't change a bit.

01:38:15.667 --> 01:38:17.440
I'll make last night a
sort of looking-glass...

01:38:17.492 --> 01:38:19.369
to remember just what we were like.

01:38:21.725 --> 01:38:23.801
Dear, how long?

01:38:24.853 --> 01:38:29.024
Don't wait too long.
Not for me, Susanne.

01:38:30.776 --> 01:38:35.770
Only good wines improve with keeping.
Time won't make me any better.

01:38:37.324 --> 01:38:38.320
I don't care.

01:38:39.076 --> 01:38:43.654
You don't know.
You don't know anything, you see?

01:38:43.747 --> 01:38:47.579
- I know a little more than I did.
- You know nothing.

01:38:47.668 --> 01:38:51.286
Nothing about men, about wine,
about life.

01:38:54.717 --> 01:38:56.460
You know nothing.

01:38:57.469 --> 01:38:59.592
I just know what I like.

01:39:17.906 --> 01:39:18.902
Here we are.

01:40:55.421 --> 01:40:57.129
Drive on!
