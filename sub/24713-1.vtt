19:39.219 --> 19:41.221
THAT'S RICKY VARGAS.
THAT'S TINO'S CLUB PARTNER.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.223
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND HIM?

19:43.223 --> 19:44.892
YEAH, NO PROBLEM?
HE GONNA LIVE?

19:44.892 --> 19:46.894
HE'LL MAKE IT.
LISTEN, GO GRAB THIS GUY UP.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.103
COME ON.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.105
ANDY, YOU NEED
TO HEAR THIS.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.107
WE'RE WORKING THE QUADRUPLE
HERE, MEDAVOY.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.483
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

19:53.483 --> 19:54.610
DANNY.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.413
TELL HIM WHAT YOU TOLD US.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.415
HE'S HERE
TO WORK OUT MY DEAL?

20:08.415 --> 20:10.876
ONCE YOU TELL HIM
WHAT HAPPENED, YEAH.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.086
ALL RIGHT,
LIKE I TOLD THESE TWO,

20:13.086 --> 20:15.839
THIS GUY I HELPED OUT
IS VERY CONNECTED,

20:15.839 --> 20:19.092
BIG TIME, SO,
I WANT RELOCATION FOR ME

20:19.092 --> 20:21.303
AND MY FAMILY
IF I COOPERATE.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.430
LOOK, TELL HIM, OR YOU'RE
GOING TO PISS ME OFF!

20:23.430 --> 20:25.807
RIGHT.
ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AGO,

20:25.807 --> 20:29.269
A GUY NAMED MAX LEGAZI
HIRED ME TO BURY A RUG,

20:29.269 --> 20:30.604
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.606
AND WHERE'D YOU PICK MAX
AND THIS RUG UP AT?

20:32.606 --> 20:35.901
TAILFEATHERS.
IT'S A STRIP CLUB.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.643
TAKE A WALK.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.190
WHERE ARE THEY GOING?

21:16.608 --> 21:19.236
YOU GET A LOOK
AT THE BODY IN THE RUG?

21:19.236 --> 21:21.029
Julian: NO.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.699
THIS, UH, LEGAZI
DIDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING

21:23.699 --> 21:25.284
WHO IT MIGHT BE?

21:25.284 --> 21:27.411
NO, WHEN WE WERE ON OUR WAY
TO BURY IT,

21:27.411 --> 21:29.496
HE WAS SNORTING UP A STORM.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.623
HE WAS SCREAMING, CURSING.
HE'S KICKING THE DASHBOARD. NO.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.250
AND WHERE'D YOU BURY
THE RUG?

21:33.250 --> 21:34.501
YEAH, NICE TRY.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.837
I'M NOT GIVING THAT UP
UNTIL I GET A DEAL.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.346
WHERE'D YOU BURY THE RUG?

21:46.346 --> 21:48.974
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M DONE TALKING, OKAY?

21:48.974 --> 21:52.185
BECAUSE I GAVE YOU A SAMPLE,
OBVIOUSLY YOU LIKE THE TASTE,

21:52.185 --> 21:55.147
AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR MY DEAL, OKAY?

21:55.147 --> 21:56.606
END OF CONVERSATION.

21:56.606 --> 21:59.026
WRONG, AND THE NEXT THING
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH

21:59.026 --> 22:01.194
BETTER BE
WHERE YOU BURIED THAT RUG.

22:01.194 --> 22:03.030
ARE YOU WITH
THE D.A.'s OFFICE?

22:03.030 --> 22:04.364
I MEAN, WHO ARE YOU?

22:04.364 --> 22:06.867
YOU GET SOMEONE IN HERE
WHO CAN WORK ME OUT A DEAL.

22:10.787 --> 22:13.498
YOUR DEAL IS THAT I DON'T
BUST YOUR SKULL OPEN.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.542
NOW, WHERE DID YOU BURY
THE RUG?

22:15.542 --> 22:18.420
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME,
OR I'LL GET AMNESIA QUICK.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.547
OHH!

22:22.007 --> 22:23.550
THAT BODY YOU BURIED,

22:23.550 --> 22:25.552
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THAT WAS MY PARTNER.

22:25.552 --> 22:28.013
NOW, I'LL LEAVE YOU DEAD
ON THIS FLOOR

22:28.013 --> 22:29.890
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHERE YOU BURIED HIM!

22:29.890 --> 22:31.433
OKAY, OKAY,
I'LL TELL YOU!

22:31.433 --> 22:32.893
WHERE?! WHERE?!

22:32.893 --> 22:35.228
IT'S A VACANT LOT DOWN
ON THE BROOKLYN WATERFRONT.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.480
OHH.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.662
JOHN, NOTIFY THE M.E.'s OFFICE.
I WANT THEM DOWN THERE.

22:52.662 --> 22:55.207
I GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS FIRST.
GO. I GOT IT.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.542
I'LL HAVE MY RADIO.
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.002
U.C.I.'s BRINGING THE VIDEO.
E.S.U.'s BRINGING
THE EQUIPMENT.

22:59.002 --> 23:01.838
ALL RIGHT,
EVERYBODY SHUT UP.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.968
ALL RIGHT, ANDY AND I ARE
GOING TO GO DOWN TO BROOKLYN.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.805
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND
THIS RICKY?
YEAH, I GOT SOME PLACES --

23:09.805 --> 23:11.556
FINE. YOU AND CONNIE
GO GRAB HIM UP.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.141
GREG AND BALDWIN,
WHY DON'T YOU GO LOOK

23:13.141 --> 23:15.435
FOR THIS OTHER GUY JULIAN DID
THE ROBBERY WITH LAST NIGHT?

23:15.435 --> 23:18.230
THAT TURNS INTO A DEAD END,
GET IN CONTACT WITH CONNIE.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.024
EVERYBODY MONITOR THEIR RADIOS
AND KEEP ME POSTED.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.360
THAT'S IT. LET'S GO.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.696
HI. I'M SORRY TO KEEP...

23:35.497 --> 23:37.833
RICKY! WHAT'S UP?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.084
NOTHING.
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

23:39.084 --> 23:40.836
YOU DOING SOME LAUNDRY?

23:40.836 --> 23:42.212
YEAH, GOTTA DO IT.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.713
RICKY, WE NEED YOUR HELP
WITH AN I.D.

23:43.713 --> 23:46.341
WE HEARD THIS GUY MIGHT HAVE
WORKED AT ONE OF YOUR CLUBS.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.512
MOVE! OUT OF THE WAY!

24:05.652 --> 24:06.903
FREEZE!

24:33.054 --> 24:34.139
GET DOWN OFF THE FENCE!

24:42.439 --> 24:43.690
THIS IS A WHOLE LOT OF TROUBLE

24:43.690 --> 24:45.609
OVER US WANTING TO ASK YOU
A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

24:45.609 --> 24:46.651
I WANT A LAWYER.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.028
OH, YEAH?

24:52.741 --> 24:54.659
WHAT WERE YOU RUNNING FOR,
RICKY?

24:54.659 --> 24:56.620
MAN, DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?
I WANT A LAWYER.

24:56.620 --> 24:57.954
YEAH, YOU'LL GET
YOUR DAMN LAWYER.

24:57.954 --> 24:59.247
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO GO SEE

24:59.247 --> 25:00.999
WHAT YOUR PARTNER TINO
HAS TO SAY.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.709
ANOTHER UNIT
JUST GRABBED HIM UP,

25:02.709 --> 25:04.503
FOUND HIM SMOKING ROCK
IN SOME APARTMENT.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.837
WORD IS HE'S NERVOUS
AND TALKATIVE.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.380
YOU'RE BETTING YOUR LIFE

25:07.380 --> 25:08.757
THAT TINO'S GONNA
KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.634
SAY WHAT YOU WANT,
BUT I AIN'T SAYING DICK,

25:10.634 --> 25:11.676
AND I WANT A LAWYER.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.802
KEEP IN MIND,
RICKY,

25:12.802 --> 25:14.095
THAT YOUR HALF-ASSED
LEGAL AID ATTORNEY

25:14.095 --> 25:15.639
AIN'T GONNA BE DOING
YOUR TIME FOR YOU.

25:15.639 --> 25:16.932
NEITHER WILL YOU.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.350
HELL WITH HIM.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.317
OH, YOU GUYS
STILL INK PEOPLE?

25:27.317 --> 25:29.569
THOUGHT THEY HAD THAT
ALL ON COMPUTERS NOW.

25:29.569 --> 25:30.904
SIT DOWN.

25:33.281 --> 25:34.282
AHH...

25:34.282 --> 25:35.867
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT,
JIMMY?

25:35.867 --> 25:37.536
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.703
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.664
I GOT A HOLD
OF SOME BAD CLAMS.

25:40.664 --> 25:41.873
EVER HAD BAD CLAMS?

25:41.873 --> 25:43.500
I WAS LIKE A VOLCANO
LAST NIGHT.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.835
YOU KNOW THEY COULD HAVE
SACRIFICED A VIRGIN ON MY ASS?

25:45.835 --> 25:47.921
WE GOT PEOPLE SAW YOU
ON 2nd AND AVENUE B.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.339
I WISH. I TELL YOU,

25:49.339 --> 25:52.592
I DIDN'T STRAY 3 FEET
FROM THE JOHN ALL NIGHT.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.803
SO, WHAT ELSE?

25:54.803 --> 25:57.514
YOU KNOW, WE DEAL
WITH KNUCKLEHEADS LIKE YOU

25:57.514 --> 25:59.099
EVERY DAY.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.101
KNUCKLEHEADS PULLING OFF
KNUCKLEHEADED ROBBERIES

26:01.101 --> 26:02.769
AGAINST OTHER KNUCKLEHEADS.

26:02.769 --> 26:05.397
WE GET PAID TO DO IT, AND MOST
DAYS IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

26:05.397 --> 26:09.234
TODAY, IT'S A PROBLEM,

26:09.234 --> 26:11.778
AND WE HAVE NO PATIENCE
RIGHT NOW,

26:11.778 --> 26:14.739
'CAUSE YOU'RE TAKING TIME
AWAY FROM OTHER THINGS,

26:14.739 --> 26:16.366
OTHER PEOPLE.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.994
SO THIS IS WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN, JIMMY.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.371
FIRST YOU BETTER LOSE
THAT SMIRK.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.123
Lose the smirk.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.458
SECOND, YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO
TELL US ABOUT ROBBING TINO,

26:25.458 --> 26:28.003
OR DON'T, IN WHICH CASE
WE TOSS YOU IN THE SYSTEM

26:28.003 --> 26:30.171
AND GO WITH JULIAN'S VERSION
HOW IT WAS YOU

26:30.171 --> 26:32.632
WHO OPENED UP ON THE STREET
AND SHOT THAT PEDESTRIAN,

26:32.632 --> 26:35.260
WHO'S CURRENTLY CLINGING TO LIFE
AT BELLEVUE, BY THE WAY.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.386
Greg: THAT'S RIGHT.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.722
JULIAN FLIPPED ON YOU.

26:38.722 --> 26:41.057
THIRD THING...
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOW,

26:41.057 --> 26:42.976
AND THERE'S A LOT RIDING
FOR BOTH OF US

26:42.976 --> 26:44.311
ON YOUR DECISION, JIMMY,

26:44.311 --> 26:46.354
'CAUSE IF YOU WASTE
ONE MORE SECOND OF MY TIME,

26:46.354 --> 26:47.731
I'M GONNA BE OUT OF A JOB,

26:47.731 --> 26:49.441
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE OUT
ABOUT EIGHT TEETH,

26:49.441 --> 26:51.109
SO THINK IT OVER

26:51.109 --> 26:52.569
VERY CAREFULLY

26:52.569 --> 26:53.945
BEFORE YOU SPEAK.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.286
GO AHEAD.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.041
LOOK, I DIDN'T SHOOT NOBODY,
ALL RIGHT?

27:06.041 --> 27:08.168
IT WAS JULIAN
THAT SHOT THAT GUY.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.170
HOW DO YOU KNOW TINO?
I DON'T.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.130
THEN HOW DID YOU KNOW
THERE WAS 50 GRAND

27:12.130 --> 27:14.299
STASHED IN HIS APARTMENT?

27:14.299 --> 27:16.801
LOOK, HIS GIRLFRIEND MARIA,
ALL RIGHT?

27:16.801 --> 27:19.179
MET HER IN A CLUB.
BEEN BANGING HER.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.639
TO KEEP ME INTERESTED,

27:20.639 --> 27:22.474
SHE GETS TO HOW
HER LIMP-DICK BOYFRIEND

27:22.474 --> 27:24.768
ALWAYS HAS A COUPLE OF GRAND
STASHED IN THE BEDROOM.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.436
WE WORK IT OUT.
I SHOW UP AT 10:00,

27:26.436 --> 27:28.605
MARIA'S GONNA ANSWER THE DOOR,
AND WE PUSH IN.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.732
BUT SHE SAYS NOT TO WORRY
'CAUSE TINO'S SOFT.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.193
HE'LL GIVE IT UP NO PROBLEM.
BUT ON THE WAY OUT,

27:33.193 --> 27:35.779
THAT CRAZY PRICK
COMES CHASING AFTER US,

27:35.779 --> 27:37.822
OUT ON THE STREET,
FIRING HIS GUN.

27:37.822 --> 27:40.784
BUT LISTEN, IT WAS JULIAN
THAT FIRED BACK, ALL RIGHT?

27:40.784 --> 27:42.202
NOT ME.

27:42.202 --> 27:45.121
NOW HE CAN KISS MY ASS,
ROLL-OVER RAT PRICK.

27:45.121 --> 27:47.499
MARIA SAID TINO KEPT A COUPLE
GRAND AROUND, BUT THERE WAS 50?

27:47.499 --> 27:49.793
YEAH, I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT HAD HIM RUNNING OUT

27:49.793 --> 27:51.795
IN THE STREET, THROWING SHOTS
IN HIS UNDERWEAR.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.338
WHERE'S THE MONEY NOW?

27:53.338 --> 27:54.923
'CAUSE WE COULD VOUCHER IT
IN YOUR NAME,

27:54.923 --> 27:55.924
AND YOU NEVER KNOW.

27:55.924 --> 27:56.925
YOU MIGHT GET IT BACK.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.514
IT'S IN MY APARTMENT.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.810
WRITE THE ADDRESS.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.572
SO, WHAT'S YOUR HISTORY
WITH THIS LEGAZI?

28:19.572 --> 28:21.783
WHEN IT STARTED OUT,
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS,

28:21.783 --> 28:24.244
BUT HE MOSTLY WANTED ME
TO SCORE DRUGS FOR HIM.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.705
HE'S MADE, SO IT'S LIKE
BENEATH HIM OR SOMETHING

28:26.705 --> 28:27.997
TO GET HIS HANDS DIRTY.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.124
YOU STILL TALK TO HIM?

28:29.124 --> 28:31.126
WELL, NO,
NOT LIKE BEFORE.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.670
I BUMP INTO HIM
ONCE IN A WHILE.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.256
LISTEN, UM,
WE'RE GOING TO NEED YOU

28:36.256 --> 28:38.591
TO RE-ESTABLISH CONTACT
WITH HIM.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.135
HEY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

28:40.135 --> 28:41.594
WELL, TO WEAR A WIRE

28:41.594 --> 28:43.722
AND GET HIM TO TALK
ABOUT THAT NIGHT.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.849
NO. NO. THAT'S NOT
PART OF THE DEAL.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.934
I SAID I'D TESTIFY,
THAT'S ALL.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.602
THERE'S NO DEAL YET,
JULIAN.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.187
ALL WE GOT
IS MAYBE A DEAD BODY,

28:51.187 --> 28:53.314
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS IT WAS HERE.

28:53.314 --> 28:54.858
SO YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR
THAT WIRE

28:54.858 --> 28:57.235
TO PROVE YOU DIDN'T
DO THIS MURDER ON YOUR OWN.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.654
I SHOULD'VE NEVER DONE THIS.
I DON'T TRUST YOU GUYS AT ALL.

28:59.654 --> 29:01.114
YOU CAN TRUST US.
NOW SHUT UP.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.116
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
GET HIM TO TALK?

29:03.116 --> 29:04.909
WHAT, I TAKE HIM OUT
FOR ICE CREAM?

29:04.909 --> 29:07.454
YOU'RE GOING TO CALL AND YOU'RE
GOING TO TELL THIS ASSHOLE

29:07.454 --> 29:09.205
THAT YOU CAME INTO SOME COKE.

29:09.205 --> 29:10.832
WE WILL COACH YOU
ON THE REST.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.000
WHAT IF HE QUIT USING?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.586
DO WE NEED HIM
AROUND HERE ANYMORE?

29:16.004 --> 29:17.589
PUT HIM IN THE CAR.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.591
I SHOULD HAVE
NEVER DONE THIS.

29:19.591 --> 29:23.052
I SHOULD HAVE
NEVER DONE THIS!

29:23.052 --> 29:23.970
WE GOT SOMETHING.

30:39.879 --> 30:41.589
RIGHT. I'LL GET BACK
TO HELP WITH THE PAPERWORK

30:41.589 --> 30:42.382
AS SOON AS I CAN.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.717
DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.
I GOT THIS.
THANKS, PARTNER.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.386
LAST CHANCE
TO HELP YOURSELF OUT, RICKY.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.304
YEAH, LIKE TALKING TO YOU
IS GONNA DO ME WONDERS.

30:48.304 --> 30:51.558
STICK HIM IN A CELL.
LET'S GO TALK TO TINO.

30:58.398 --> 30:59.566
ANY WORD?

31:05.321 --> 31:08.324
THEY, UH,
FOUND DANNY'S BODY.

31:08.324 --> 31:11.077
OKAY.

31:11.077 --> 31:13.329
WELL, UH,

31:13.329 --> 31:15.874
WE GOT RICKY,
BUT HE LAWYERED UP,

31:15.874 --> 31:18.877
SO NOW I GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE NEXT MOVE IS.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.879
UH, IS TINO
OUT OF I.C.U. YET?

31:20.879 --> 31:22.088
NO.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.673
THE GUY BEHIND THE ROBBERY

31:23.673 --> 31:25.258
AT TINO'S PLACE LAST NIGHT --

31:25.258 --> 31:26.843
NAME'S JIMMY GIGLIO.

31:26.843 --> 31:30.138
HE WAS BANGING
TINO'S GIRLFRIEND MARIA.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.810

I'LL GO TALK TO HER.

31:44.193 --> 31:46.321
KEEP HIM COMPANY.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.406

WITH AGENT BOYD YET?

31:48.406 --> 31:49.908
HE SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

31:49.908 --> 31:50.783
HE'S GONNA COME HERE,

31:50.783 --> 31:52.577
HE'S GONNA LOCK US DOWN
WITH A BUNCH OF B.S.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.996

AND PROTOCOL AND TESTAMENTS.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.956

32:23.608 --> 32:26.152

32:54.806 --> 32:56.391
BROOKLYN.
AND WE GOT THE GUY

32:56.391 --> 32:58.101
WHO DROVE THE MAN
AND HELPED BURY THE BODY.

32:58.101 --> 33:00.103
HE GOT THE CALL
FROM A MAX LEGAZI

33:00.103 --> 33:01.270
AT TAILFEATHERS.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.480
LEGAZI'S OUR GUY.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.482
YOU KNOW MAX IS THE SON
OF A COP THOUGH, RIGHT?

33:04.482 --> 33:07.819
I DON'T CARE WHO HE IS. WE
HAVE A SHOT WITH HIS ACCOMPLICE

33:07.819 --> 33:10.154

CAN GET LEGAZI TO TALK.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.948
SO YOUR GUY'S READY
TO COOPERATE FULLY?

33:11.948 --> 33:14.617
TODAY HE IS.
TOMORROW, WHO KNOWS?

33:14.617 --> 33:15.868
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME HERE?

33:15.868 --> 33:17.328
WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR GUY
WEAR A WIRE

33:17.328 --> 33:19.497
AGAINST LEGAZI TOMORROW
AT TAILFEATHERS.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.207
WE NEED YOU TO OKAY IT.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.500
WHOA, THAT'S BIG.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.380
YOU WRITE IT UP, AND I'LL
RUN IT FOR MY SUPERIORS.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.423
DID I TELL YOU?

33:28.423 --> 33:31.300
I'M CONFIDENT YOU'RE CAPABLE
OF SIGNING OFF ON THIS

33:31.300 --> 33:33.052
AND REPORTING TO YOUR SUPERIORS
THAT YOU DID SO

33:33.052 --> 33:35.680
BECAUSE TIME WAS
OF THE ESSENCE, WHICH IT IS.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.473
THE INDICTMENTS
YOU WERE WAITING ON

33:37.473 --> 33:39.600
WHEN SORENSON AND YOUR AGENT
WENT MISSING,

33:39.600 --> 33:42.186
THE INDICTMENTS FOR YOUR
SUPERIORS THAT HANDCUFFED US,

33:42.186 --> 33:44.063
WHAT DID YOU END UP
GETTING OUT OF THOSE?

33:44.063 --> 33:45.189
NOT A HELL OF A LOT.

33:45.189 --> 33:48.276
LEGAZI IS THE GUY
WHO KILLED SORENSON

33:48.276 --> 33:50.069
AND MOST LIKELY
KILLED YOUR AGENT

33:50.069 --> 33:51.988
THAT YOU HAD UNDERCOVER
AT THAT CLUB.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.656
THAT AGENT WAS YOUR FRIEND,
RIGHT?

33:56.242 --> 33:58.286
ALL RIGHT.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.621
PERSONNEL, SURVEILLANCE.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.874
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU NEED.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.965
IT SMELLS LIKE PUKE
IN HERE.

34:10.965 --> 34:12.759
RECOGNIZE IT?

34:12.759 --> 34:14.719
WHAT, THE PUKE?
YEAH. IT'S TINO'S.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.012
BAD CASE OF THE NERVES

34:16.012 --> 34:18.264
OFF WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT, I GUESS,

34:18.264 --> 34:21.642
PLUS FINDING OUT HIS GIRLFRIEND
SET HIM UP FOR A ROBBERY

34:21.642 --> 34:24.353
WITH THE GUY SHE WAS BANGING
BEHIND HIS BACK.

34:24.353 --> 34:27.023
THAT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY GUY
TOSS THEM UP.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.441
WHERE'S TINO AT NOW?

34:28.441 --> 34:30.777
DOWNSTAIRS
TALKING TO DETECTIVES.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.111
SO IS RICKY.

34:32.111 --> 34:34.155
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW,
MARIA,

34:34.155 --> 34:36.157
THEY'RE BOTH PISSED OFF
AT YOU,

34:36.157 --> 34:38.868
SAYING THINGS ABOUT YOUR
INVOLVEMENT LAST NIGHT,

34:38.868 --> 34:40.912
AND I'M TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT IF IT'S TRUE

34:40.912 --> 34:43.414
OR IF THEY'RE JUST MAKING
THINGS UP TO GET BACK AT YOU.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.750
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?
WHAT'S RICKY SAYING?

34:45.750 --> 34:47.752
BECAUSE IF ANYBODY
SHOULDN'T BE TALKING

34:47.752 --> 34:49.837
ABOUT WHAT THEY DID
LAST NIGHT, IT'S RICKY.

34:49.837 --> 34:51.380
I SEE IT
ALL THE TIME, MARIA.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.341
THE ONE PERSON
WHO KEEPS THEIR MOUTH SHUT,

34:53.341 --> 34:55.301
THINKING THE OTHERS
ARE DOING THE SAME,

34:55.301 --> 34:56.928
THEY'RE THE ONE
WHO GETS SCREWED.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.179
WHAT'S RICKY SAYING?

34:58.179 --> 34:59.972
I WANT YOUR VERSION
OF WHAT HAPPENED,

34:59.972 --> 35:01.140
BUT I NEED IT NOW

35:01.140 --> 35:02.809
BEFORE RICKY AND TINO
GET THERE FIRST.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.560
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT
TO GO OVER THERE,

35:04.560 --> 35:05.812
AND IT WAS NOT MY IDEA.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.021
OVER TO TERESA'S.

35:07.021 --> 35:08.940
YEAH. THEY WERE ALL
UP IN MY FACE,

35:08.940 --> 35:10.900
SCREAMING, "DID YOU
OPEN YOUR MOUTH TO TERESA?"

35:10.900 --> 35:12.610
AND I'M LIKE,
"I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE."

35:12.610 --> 35:14.779
I SAID IT JUST SO I COULD
BREATHE FOR A SECOND.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.364
OPEN YOUR MOUTH ABOUT WHAT?

35:16.364 --> 35:18.491
ABOUT TINO KEEPING MONEY
IN HIS CLOSET.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.076
HE USUALLY KEPT
ONLY A COUPLE GRAND,

35:20.076 --> 35:22.745
BUT THERE WAS 50 LAST NIGHT.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.497
AND HALF OF THAT
WAS RICKY'S MONEY

35:24.497 --> 35:26.874
THAT TINO WAS SUPPOSED TO
GIVE HIM LATER.

35:26.874 --> 35:28.084
BUT WHEN I FOUND OUT

35:28.084 --> 35:30.211
THAT RICKY'S MONEY
WAS STOLEN, TOO,

35:30.211 --> 35:32.547
I KNEW
I'D REALLY SCREWED UP,

35:32.547 --> 35:36.217
'CAUSE RICKY'S...

35:36.217 --> 35:37.969
HE'S CRAZY.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.305
SO YOU TOLD THEM YOU MAY HAVE
MENTIONED IT TO TERESA?

35:41.305 --> 35:43.724
JUST TO GET THEM
OUT OF MY FACE.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.017
AND YOU CALLED HER
ON YOUR CELL PHONE

35:45.017 --> 35:47.395
TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS HOME.
THEY MADE ME CALL HER.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.479
SO YOU WENT OVER THERE.

35:51.482 --> 35:54.110
I DID NOT WANT THIS
TO HAPPEN.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.362
I SWEAR TO GOD.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.489
BUT TERESA GETS ALL
UP IN RICKY'S FACE,

35:58.489 --> 36:00.158
SCREAMING AT HIM
TO GET OUT

36:00.158 --> 36:01.617
AND SWEARING AT HIM,

36:01.617 --> 36:03.536
AND I'M TELLING HER
TO CALM DOWN.

36:03.536 --> 36:09.041
AND THEN RICKY JUST...

36:09.041 --> 36:11.502
HE KILL ALL FOUR GIRLS?

36:14.881 --> 36:17.008
TERESA, IRMA, LORENA,

36:17.008 --> 36:19.677
AND THEN HE PUTS THE GUN
TO TINO'S HEAD

36:19.677 --> 36:22.138
AND TELLS HIM
THAT HE GOTTA SHOOT DINA

36:22.138 --> 36:24.307
SO THAT TINO BE
IN ON IT, TOO.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.726
AND THEN THEY WALKED
BACK IN THE BEDROOM,

36:26.726 --> 36:28.936
AND I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT TINO DID,

36:28.936 --> 36:30.646
'CAUSE THE LOOK
ON HIS FACE...

36:30.646 --> 36:34.942
AND THEN RICKY
PUTS THE GUN TO MY HEAD,

36:34.942 --> 36:40.239
AND TINO'S BEGGING HIM
NOT TO.

36:40.239 --> 36:42.033
AND I'M ON MY KNEES,

36:42.033 --> 36:44.744
AND I SEE TERESA
ON THE FLOOR.

36:46.787 --> 36:49.373
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:49.373 --> 36:52.877
I DIDN'T CARE IF HE
PULLED THE TRIGGER.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.633
I WISH HE DID.

37:00.843 --> 37:01.802
CAN'T DO IT.

37:01.802 --> 37:02.887
YEAH, YOU CAN.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.013
THIS GUY'S A KILLER,
MAN. I --

37:04.013 --> 37:06.265
JULIAN, YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS.

37:06.265 --> 37:07.808

PICK UP THAT PHONE,

37:07.808 --> 37:09.602
AND YOU'RE GONNA KEEP IT
SIMPLE, LIKE WE REHEARSED,

37:09.602 --> 37:11.187
OR YOU'RE GONNA
GO UP FOR MURDER.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.439
OKAY.
I'LL KEEP IT SIMPLE.

37:13.439 --> 37:14.482
RIGHT.

37:24.492 --> 37:27.161
THERE'S NO ANSWER.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.418
YEAH, LISTEN, YOU KNOW,

37:34.418 --> 37:36.254

37:36.254 --> 37:39.465
I CAME INTO SOME WICKED
SCHNIGHT, IF YOU KNOW

37:39.465 --> 37:42.301
SO I PUT IT

37:42.301 --> 37:44.971
OKAY. COOL.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.305

37:48.641 --> 37:50.893
OH, YEAH, SURE,

37:50.893 --> 37:52.853
SO, THEN, UH,

Tony: SEE,
ONE EASY STEP AT A TIME,

38:03.197 --> 38:04.865

THAT'S ALL IT IS.

38:04.865 --> 38:06.325
OKAY, SO WHAT?

38:06.325 --> 38:07.326
THEN I JUST --

38:07.326 --> 38:09.829
I WALK IN THERE TOMORROW
AND WHAT?

38:09.829 --> 38:11.247
Tony: WE'LL
WORK THAT ALL OUT.

38:11.247 --> 38:13.249
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW
IS PUT YOU UP IN A HOTEL

38:13.249 --> 38:14.417
AND GET SET UP HERE

38:14.417 --> 38:15.876
WHEN DO I GET MY DEAL?

38:15.876 --> 38:18.629
DON'T ASK THAT QUESTION AGAIN.
I SWEAR TO GOD.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.089
ALL RIGHT,
WHO'S GOING IN WITH ME

38:20.089 --> 38:21.132
WHEN I GO SEE MAX?

38:21.132 --> 38:23.134
YOU'LL GO BY YOURSELF.
WE'LL BE SET UP RIGHT OUTSIDE.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.510
NO! NO WAY!
FORGET IT.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.304
I WANT SOMEBODY
IN THERE WITH A GUN

38:26.304 --> 38:27.972
WHO'S WATCHING MY BACK!

38:27.972 --> 38:29.390
WE'LL GET YOU
SOMEBODY. NOW COME ON.

38:29.390 --> 38:30.891
I WANT TO CALL MY GIRLFRIEND.

38:30.891 --> 38:33.227
I WANT TO CALL HER
NOW, OKAY?!
CHILL OUT!

38:33.227 --> 38:34.770
I'M PUTTING MY LIFE
ON THE LINE HERE!

38:34.770 --> 38:36.105
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO ME!

38:36.105 --> 38:38.357
I WANT TO TALK TO HER.
I WANT TO HAVE HER

38:38.357 --> 38:39.567
KISS MY CHILDREN FOR ME.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.277
ALL RIGHT,
CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

38:41.277 --> 38:44.322
BUT YOU DON'T MENTION<i> ANYTHING</i>
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

38:44.322 --> 38:45.239
AND CHILL OUT.

38:56.917 --> 38:59.503
MARIA'S SAYING SHE DIDN'T
KNOW THEY'D KILL ANYBODY.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.297
THEN WHY'D SHE GIVE UP
HER FRIEND?

39:01.297 --> 39:02.298
SHE WAS SCARED.

39:02.298 --> 39:03.841
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT
THEY'D HURT HER.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.343
I GUESS.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.011
IF SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE
GOING TO HURT HER,

39:07.011 --> 39:08.554
THEN SHE KNEW THEY WERE
LIKELY TO HURT TERESA.

39:08.554 --> 39:11.182
YEAH. OKAY, UM...

39:11.182 --> 39:12.725
I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
AND THAT'S FINE,

39:12.725 --> 39:15.061
BECAUSE I'M -- I'M NOT INVESTED
IN THIS GIRL EITHER WAY.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.562
SHE'S A PRINCIPAL
MURDER ONE,

39:16.562 --> 39:19.106
BUT USE THAT TO GET HER
TO TESTIFY AGAINST THE OTHERS,

39:19.106 --> 39:21.859
'CAUSE, WELL,
WE WANT THEM MORE, RIGHT?

39:21.859 --> 39:23.819
YEAH.

39:23.819 --> 39:26.322
HOW'S ANDY TAKING IT?

39:26.322 --> 39:27.865
I DON'T KNOW.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.829
THANKS FOR COMING.
SURE.

39:33.829 --> 39:35.456
YOU GOT TO TALK
TO THIS IDIOT.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.917
HE WON'T DO THIS UNLESS
HE GETS THE WITNESS PROGRAM.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.293
THAT'S FEDERAL.

39:39.293 --> 39:42.213
I KNOW, BUT YOU JUST WALK IN
THERE AND SHOW HIM YOUR I.D.,

39:42.213 --> 39:43.672
STROKE HIM.
HE WON'T SHUT UP.

39:43.672 --> 39:44.673
COFFEE ROOM?

39:44.673 --> 39:46.967
HE'S IN THERE
WITH GREG AND BALDWIN.

39:49.095 --> 39:50.388
Tony: I'M GOING
TO STRANGLE HIM.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.722
HE ACTING UP?

39:51.722 --> 39:55.601
HE'S JUST, UH...

39:55.601 --> 39:58.020
WE SHOULD MEET HERE AT 7:00
INSTEAD OF 8:00.

39:58.020 --> 40:00.022
WE GOT TO COACH HIM MORE.
HE'S TOO SHAKY.

40:00.022 --> 40:02.149
THE MORE WE COACH HIM,
THE MORE CONFUSED HE GETS.

40:02.149 --> 40:03.317
LET'S JUST GO
WITH WHAT WE GOT.

40:07.321 --> 40:09.281
LIEUTENANT,
YOU ASKED FOR ME?

40:09.281 --> 40:10.282
YEAH, WE NEED YOU TOMORROW.

40:10.282 --> 40:11.033
YOU GOT IT.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.493
WE NEED YOU
TO BACK UP A WITNESS

40:12.493 --> 40:13.661
WHO'S GOING
TO BE WEARING A WIRE, OKAY?

40:13.661 --> 40:16.122
YOU'LL POSE AS HIS FRIEND.
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM,

40:16.122 --> 40:18.082
BUT YOU WON'T HAVE TO
BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.418
YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
WITH WHAT I JUST LAID OUT?
NONE.
