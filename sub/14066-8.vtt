00:13.888 --> 00:14.889

00:19.853 --> 00:21.271

(grunting)

01:05.607 --> 01:07.192
(knocking on door)

01:09.694 --> 01:11.738
Sir, could you step out
of the stall, please?

01:15.450 --> 01:17.619
Sir, can I see some
identification, please?

01:17.702 --> 01:19.162
It's a courthouse. Denny Crane.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.998
I don't need to identify myself
in a courthouse.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.249
Please place your hands
behind your back, sir.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.459
Why?

01:24.542 --> 01:25.919
Sir, you are under arrest
for solicitation.

01:26.002 --> 01:26.836
What?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.338
-You have the right to remain silent.
-Solicit--

01:28.421 --> 01:29.547
Anything you say
can and will be used against you...

01:29.631 --> 01:30.965
-Who the hell did I solicit?
-...in a court of law.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.592
You have the right to an attorney.

01:32.675 --> 01:34.636
Sir, please put your hands
behind your back now.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.137
-Alan.
-All right. That's it.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.055
Get him down on the floor.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.973
Wait a minute! Hey. Wait! (grunts)

01:39.057 --> 01:40.809
Al... Alan!

01:41.267 --> 01:42.727
Alan! Pick up, will you?

01:43.269 --> 01:45.355
Alan! Pick up!

01:45.438 --> 01:46.523
(theme music playing)

01:46.606 --> 01:49.067
Alan! Alan!

02:22.142 --> 02:24.644
WHISTLER: He did all the known signals
for solicitation.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.354
In fact, he was quite methodical about it.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.814
-He's full of crap.
-Denny.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.649
Well, so was I, but I was constipated.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.026
What known signals?

02:32.110 --> 02:34.154
Well, first he came in,
looked under the stall doors.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.823
Then he entered a stall
next to an occupied one.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.366
He slid his briefcase to the front,

02:38.449 --> 02:40.827
making his feet visible
to the adjacent occupant.

02:40.910 --> 02:43.705
-Oh, please. I--
-He then moved his foot over.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.498
Then he began to hum quietly.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.501
Then he tapped his foot
four times, up and down.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.545
-Look, now first, we--
-Denny.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.547
Sir, look.
There's really no point denying this.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.133
Unless you consider innocence a point.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.343
Would that be a point worth considering?

02:57.427 --> 02:59.762
These are well-known solicitation signals.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.389
-(scoffs)
-You didn't even go to the bathroom,

03:01.472 --> 03:02.348
by the way, did you?

03:02.432 --> 03:05.351
Because I was constipated.
Did we not go over this?

03:05.435 --> 03:07.896
My suggestion is that
you make this go away quietly.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.648
Bribe. I knew it.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.567
I'm not suggesting a bribe.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.195
My recommendation is that you plead guilty
to disorderly conduct.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.697
(chuckles)
He's not gonna plead guilty to anything.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.908
You really want these charges
to be made public?

03:20.366 --> 03:23.411
This sounds an awful lot like extortion,
Officer Whistler.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.663
It's not extortion.
I'm just saying your choice.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.832
Disorderly conduct and a small fine

03:27.916 --> 03:30.877
or a public trial
for solicitation to have gay sex.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.253
Trial.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.840
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Denny. Trial.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.343
(exclaiming)

03:42.096 --> 03:44.682
-(elevator bell dings)
-Why are you angry at me?

03:44.766 --> 03:46.726
Because I could've made this thing
go away quietly.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.270
-You're making it into a cause.
-I am not, Denny.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.731
You're being Larry Craig-d here,
and it isn't fair.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.399
But with a public trial?

03:53.483 --> 03:55.735
It's one thing for people
to think I've got Alzheimer's

03:55.818 --> 03:58.821
or I've lost my mind,
but for them to think I'm gay?

03:58.905 --> 04:03.409
Denny, for God's sake, you cannot
plead guilty. It's a ridiculous charge.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.619
The police had no bus--

04:06.537 --> 04:07.705
What's going on?

04:08.289 --> 04:10.541
Uh, Denny had a little
misunderstanding this morning.

04:12.210 --> 04:16.089
In an effort to relieve
some mild constipation,

04:16.673 --> 04:18.675
he unwittingly offered
to be a whistle-blower

04:18.758 --> 04:20.343
for an undercover police officer.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.973
-It happens.
-He's being arraigned this afternoon.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.766
I'm moving for an immediate dismissal.

04:41.614 --> 04:45.159
The Battleship. As I live and breathe.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.705
Wow. You get more and more beautiful.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.207
Who's suing you now?

04:52.166 --> 04:53.710
I take it you haven't heard.

04:54.919 --> 04:55.753
Uh-oh.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.881
-I got fired, Shirl.
-What?

04:58.965 --> 05:01.634
As of now, you're looking at
an unemployed shock jock.

05:02.802 --> 05:03.928
What did you say?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.138
Oh, nothing too bad,

05:05.221 --> 05:08.224
-but as far as the station's concerned--
-What did you say?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.310
Oh, something like,
"Old people should die."

05:11.352 --> 05:12.812
You said that on the air?

05:12.895 --> 05:14.480
Oh, come on.
It's the radio, for God sakes.

05:14.564 --> 05:18.276
If you can't be vulgar there...
Free speech. Rah!

05:20.653 --> 05:21.821
Look, seriously, Shirley...

05:23.823 --> 05:25.616
I'm not a young man.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.870
If I lose this gig,
I may not get another one.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.371
I need to fight this.

05:30.830 --> 05:31.664
(sighs)

05:32.623 --> 05:34.584
"Old people should die."

05:35.293 --> 05:37.712
Free speech. Rah.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.255
(chuckles)

05:39.339 --> 05:40.173
Rah.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.509
-Why would Paul want to see us?
-Obviously Sack told him.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.927
Maybe Paul's gay.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.512
God, why can't I have that?

05:51.351 --> 05:54.812
Ah. I see somebody has run
to the principal's office.

05:55.021 --> 05:58.816
-Hello, Alan. Denny, how are you?
-Not gay.

05:59.609 --> 06:00.443
Yes.

06:01.152 --> 06:04.072
Carl has shared with me the latest.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.157
I'm told there's a chance
of making this go away

06:06.240 --> 06:08.326
with a disorderly conduct plea.

06:08.409 --> 06:09.952
That was rejected.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.205
May I ask why?

06:13.623 --> 06:14.832
He's innocent, Paul.

06:14.916 --> 06:18.878
Alan, you know and I know
that the charges alone--

06:18.961 --> 06:20.713
Denny's been charged with crimes before.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.674
This one leaves its own special tarnish.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.594
Even an outright acquittal
won't amount to exoneration.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.055
We need to dispose of this
as quietly as possible.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.681
(laughs) This is ridiculous.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.601
He's being railroaded
by some overzealous cop

06:33.684 --> 06:35.269
who's staking out a bathroom.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.022
I don't know
if it's more offensive or silly.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.525
Denny, may I speak with you in private?

06:42.318 --> 06:43.945
Let's go, Al.
Let's give them some special time.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.989
If you care to leave, Carl, please do so,

06:47.073 --> 06:49.117
but, Paul, anything you have to say
to Denny, you can say--

06:49.200 --> 06:51.452
With all due respect to your friendship,

06:51.994 --> 06:54.288
Denny and I go back almost 40 years.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.083
Wow. You really are old, Paul.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.588
Go ahead, Alan.
Bond with Carl for a second.

07:02.672 --> 07:03.965
No sleepovers.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.013
(exhales)

07:12.473 --> 07:15.643
Carl Sack has the job
of worrying about the firm.

07:15.726 --> 07:18.604
I was happy to pass that baton.

07:20.815 --> 07:23.317
I'm concerned about you.

07:24.318 --> 07:28.531
Look, I see Alan all poised here
to climb on his soapbox,

07:29.073 --> 07:30.366
but at whose expense?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.368
If I plead to disorderly,

07:32.452 --> 07:34.537
the papers'll make straw
out of that as well.

07:34.871 --> 07:35.746
Denny...

07:36.873 --> 07:40.209
your grip on your position here
as senior partner,

07:40.293 --> 07:43.463
I know you know is a little tenuous.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.923
This may be all the managing partners need

07:46.007 --> 07:48.217
to finally take your name off the door.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.471
-Which is why I need to be vindicated.
-And should you lose?

07:52.388 --> 07:53.222
Paul...

07:55.725 --> 07:59.187
right or wrong, I need to go out as...

08:00.688 --> 08:01.731
Denny Crane.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.943
I don't want my legacy to... (sighs)

08:11.574 --> 08:13.826
It's worth risking my job...

08:15.119 --> 08:16.370
to save my reputation.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.500
I'm afraid you may lose both.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.251
Not if we win.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.214
All or nothing.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.759
You and I used to say that all the time.

08:32.887 --> 08:33.721
Remember?

08:39.602 --> 08:41.562
(indistinct murmuring)

08:41.646 --> 08:43.689
Why a judge and not a jury?

08:43.773 --> 08:45.525
Juries can't give equitable relief.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.277
Plus, they don't especially
enjoy being summoned

08:48.361 --> 08:50.446
for something trivial
like First Amendment.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.281
BETHANY: Well, well, well.

08:54.992 --> 08:57.245
-Bethany.
-Shirley.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.747
Wow. You've let yourself go.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.916
I find that refreshing.

09:01.999 --> 09:06.295
It's so nice to see an elderly person
who's not afraid to look her age.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.173
Yes, well, vanity can be
quite the beast, I suppose.

09:09.757 --> 09:13.052
-I see you're wearing heels.
-Dwarf jokes. Classy.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.179
-MALE BAILIFF: All rise.
-(clears throat)

09:16.722 --> 09:19.892
In re: <i>Binder vs. WWEN Boston.</i>

09:19.976 --> 09:22.103
Judge Victoria Thomson presiding.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.521
This court is in session.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.190
Good morning, Your Honor.
Shirley Schmidt for the plaintiff.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.651
I'm not interested.
Who's the station manager?

09:28.734 --> 09:29.944
Uh, I am, Your Honor.

09:30.027 --> 09:34.991
And my name is Bethany Horowitz.
I represent WWEN.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.659
And why are you staring?

09:37.368 --> 09:39.870
'Cause I almost bought that same outfit.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.664
Sit your itty-bitty self down.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.749
Mr. Flanders, in the witness chair now.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.710
-Move it.
-BETHANY: But wait a second.

09:45.793 --> 09:48.462
-They're the ones suing.
-JUDGE THOMSON: I know that.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.840
I want to hear from him. Now.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.724
<i>Denny Crane in a men's room.</i>

10:00.057 --> 10:01.601
<i>Don't you just love that?</i>

10:01.684 --> 10:04.186
<i>Another "family values" advocate</i>

10:04.270 --> 10:07.189
<i>looking to use another man's private part</i>

10:07.273 --> 10:09.400
<i>-as a sippy cup.</i>
-Oh, God.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.943
<i>Time to go to church now, Denny?</i>

10:11.027 --> 10:13.821
<i>Time to get in touch with God?</i>
<i>Off to rehab we go?</i>

10:13.904 --> 10:16.782
<i>Doesn't it just make you want to snorkel</i>
<i>in your mother's vomit?</i>

10:16.866 --> 10:17.700
(turns off TV)

10:19.076 --> 10:21.495
I can't take it. The press is into it.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.164
I'm gay fodder. I can't take it.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.082
Come on, Denny. Let's just get to court.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.793
That woman, of all people,
knows I am straight.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.670
She told me
it was the best sex she ever had

10:29.754 --> 10:31.088
since her brother in ninth grade.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.089
She told me.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.216
We go for immediate dismissal.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.552
-None of this continuance crap.
-Immediate.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.891
-Lorraine.
-Alan. Denny.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.353
Would you be riding
on the elevator with us?

10:45.436 --> 10:46.687
Think you can handle it, Denny?

10:47.229 --> 10:49.398
(laughs) Well, maybe not.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.778
I don't know whether you've heard
about my, uh, predicament.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.946
I heard that you were humming
in the men's room.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.865
-That predicament?
-Yeah. Yeah.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.368
Rumors are ugly things, Lorraine.

11:01.577 --> 11:04.288
-I'll bet there's some about you.
-I wouldn't know.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.166
Neither would I. (chuckles)

11:07.249 --> 11:11.587
There are security cameras
on these elevators.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.216
If I were to have sex
on one with a-a woman,

11:15.299 --> 11:19.679
that would dispel
the horrible rumor that I, um...

11:19.762 --> 11:21.347
Uh, you know, uh...

11:21.430 --> 11:23.891
-Like to hum in men's rooms?
-Would you mind?

11:23.974 --> 11:27.269
Not at all, Denny.
But I am involved, so I can't.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.523
-Please. It's an emergency.
-Perhaps you should call 999.

11:30.606 --> 11:31.565
(elevator bell dings)

11:34.694 --> 11:36.362
-What's his name?
-I'm sorry?

11:36.445 --> 11:37.947
Uh, the boyfriend. What's his name?

11:41.992 --> 11:43.953
-Were we meant to get on that?
-(groans)

11:54.588 --> 11:56.382
-Hey, Lorraine.
-Katie.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.885
How are you liking working here so far,

11:59.969 --> 12:02.805
aside from the misogynistic
bits and pieces?

12:02.888 --> 12:05.933
Oh, it's fine.
Personally, I enjoy being objectified.

12:06.016 --> 12:09.228
It's a wonderful prophylactic
if one doesn't care to be really known.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.855
(chuckles) I suppose.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.566
Somehow I feel I know you.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.569
Have we met before Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt?

12:16.652 --> 12:17.486
I don't believe we have.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.405
Odd.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.031
Have you ever spent time in England?

12:21.115 --> 12:23.534
I haven't actually,
though I've always wanted to go.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.078
I just thought perhaps...

12:27.121 --> 12:30.249
When Denny said earlier he had
an emergency, you said, "Call 999."

12:31.041 --> 12:32.585
It's 911 actually.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.587
Of course it is. I said 999?

12:34.962 --> 12:38.174
Yes, which coincidentally
is the number one calls for an emergency

12:38.257 --> 12:39.091
in England.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.426
Hmm.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.513
-I guess that is a coincidence.
-Yes.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.895
Bye, Katie.
Hope the rest of your day goes well.

12:51.395 --> 12:52.229
You, too.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.365
Look, it's all about sales.

13:03.699 --> 13:07.244
Here we're faced with advertiser pullout,
a boycott by listeners.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.455
But he's a shock jock.
This is what he does.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.124
FLANDERS:
Yes, and if he makes money for us, fine.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.251
If he doesn't... (clicks tongue)
he goes.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.170
(scoffs) It's nothing personal here.

13:16.253 --> 13:19.006
He's been saying outrageous things
for 25 years.

13:19.089 --> 13:22.426
Yes, and a lot of people
have been listening to him for 25 years.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.513
-BETHANY: So, what's changed?
-Those listeners are old now.

13:25.596 --> 13:30.351
If he wants to put down Blacks,
or Jews or Episcopalians, fine.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.520
But our demographic is baby boomers.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.773
Insulting old people,
it affects our bottom line.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.066
It's a no-can-do.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.860
So, you admit that what he said

13:39.944 --> 13:42.238
was in the context of social commentary?

13:43.155 --> 13:46.283
-So what?
-So what? You're primarily a news station.

13:46.367 --> 13:50.162
No. We're primarily a profit center,
like every other news station.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.500
You had Ann Coulter on the show
last week as a guest.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.044
This is a woman
who referred to John Edwards

13:57.127 --> 13:59.547
using the homosexual "F" word.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.174
(chuckling)
No one takes Ann Coulter seriously.

14:02.591 --> 14:03.634
She's a joke.

14:03.717 --> 14:07.346
Since Bob is actually respected
for his political commentary...

14:08.305 --> 14:10.140
his remarks are more dangerous.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.602
You don't see a problem
firing a political commentator

14:13.686 --> 14:15.271
for making a political comment?

14:16.313 --> 14:17.356
Not really.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.526
Huh.

14:21.110 --> 14:25.781
Case number 66266.
<i>The Commonwealth versus Denny Crane.</i>

14:25.865 --> 14:28.117
Alan Shore appearing for Mr. Crane.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.911
I would ask that this arraignment
be quashed immediately.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.956
-You cannot quash an arraignment.
-But you can, Your Honor,

14:34.039 --> 14:36.083
and you should here,
because if you look at the facts,

14:36.166 --> 14:37.793
you'll see that even as alleged,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.712
they don't support
the charges being filed.

14:39.795 --> 14:40.880
No money ever changed hands.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.007
You don't have to go that far.
It's an inchoate crime.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.926
Suppose he just hit on another man
he found attractive?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.803
-Oh, my God.
-ALAN: Are you saying it's a crime

14:47.887 --> 14:49.555
for one man to propose sex to another?

14:49.638 --> 14:51.265
In some states, it probably is.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.268
But this is Massachusetts,
the home of Mitt Romney,

14:54.351 --> 14:56.604
a man who was once okay with gay unions.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.440
Though he's not okay with them now.

14:59.523 --> 15:02.151
-Let's all be clear on that.
-(gavel pounds)

15:02.651 --> 15:04.486
I'll not have you attacking my governor.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.447
Judge, you shouldn't even be on this case.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.033
If you'll remember,
I once defended you on a subject

15:09.116 --> 15:10.826
very near and dear to this one.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.913
I can be impartial. And I shall be.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.789
And you cannot quash an arraignment.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.709
If you want to try to kick it
after charges are filed--

15:18.792 --> 15:20.336
And that's Mr. Crane's choice?

15:20.419 --> 15:22.171
To plead out or face public ridicule?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.256
Have you noticed all the cameras,
by the way?

15:24.340 --> 15:25.925
It's extortion. This is a witch hunt.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.093
The DA's office
probably targeted Mr. Crane

15:28.177 --> 15:29.470
because of all the bad blood between--

15:29.553 --> 15:31.639
This is the United States of America!

15:31.722 --> 15:35.059
Our system of justice
does not dictate to district attorneys

15:35.142 --> 15:37.978
who should or should not be prosecuted.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.649
Your points may be good ones.

15:42.066 --> 15:45.986
But they are to be decided
by the trier of fact,

15:46.528 --> 15:48.030
which, in this case, is the jury.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.866
This case will go to trial.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.534
Adjourned.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.622
"Disorderly" is still on the table.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.295
Denny, maybe you should consider
making a deal here.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.881
-If you get convicted--
-Mm-mm. No.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.258
We go to trial.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.551
Are you sure? Don't do this because of me.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.304
I'm doing it because of me.
We go to trial.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.850
But you have to win it.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.310
Uh-huh.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.359
(reporters indistinct)

16:35.119 --> 16:39.123
-Familiar how?
-I just feel I've seen her before or...

16:39.206 --> 16:41.208
Don't you think it's odd
she says she's never been to England,

16:41.291 --> 16:42.876
and she said call 999?

16:42.960 --> 16:45.587
-It could be a coincidence.
-I also detect an English accent.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.923
-You do? Really?
-Well, sometimes.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.508
Barely noticeable, but...

16:49.591 --> 16:53.178
-Why don't we just Google her?
-I did. I didn't find anything.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.806
I know this is horrible of me to say,

16:56.181 --> 16:58.517
but for some reason,
I just have this feeling...

16:59.727 --> 17:00.561
she's a criminal.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.105
I thought you liked everybody.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.525
-Oh, I do, and I like her. I just--
-Think she's a criminal.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.947
A lot of people were hugely offended
by what you said.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.782
But what I said was political commentary.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.368
-Moreover, it was important.
-Important?

17:16.452 --> 17:18.162
Oh, this I gotta hear.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.913
You sit your itty-bitty little self down.

17:20.914 --> 17:21.790
I want that on the record.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.710
How was the content important, Bob?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.796
Our government,
at least on a national level,

17:27.880 --> 17:31.050
is becoming little more than
an income transfer mechanism

17:31.133 --> 17:33.510
from younger workers to the old retirees.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.971
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid

17:36.055 --> 17:39.600
already take up
over 40% of the federal budget.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.977
And in the next 25 years,

17:42.061 --> 17:46.315
the number of people over 65
is expected to double.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.650
Now, does anybody get what that means?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.819
We could be heading for a day

17:50.903 --> 17:53.155
when the bulk of our federal budget

17:53.447 --> 17:55.532
goes to subsidizing retirees.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.911
None of the politicians
will even talk about it.

17:58.994 --> 18:02.122
Why? Because who's primarily
funding this next election?

18:02.206 --> 18:03.624
Baby boomers.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.086
So, your solution
is for old people to die?

18:07.169 --> 18:09.671
I was making a point in a provocative way.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.424
An offensive, indecent, disgusting way.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.761
I'm going to just wing it
and say argumentative.

18:15.844 --> 18:18.222
I didn't interrupt your questions.
What is this?

18:18.305 --> 18:20.849
They're called objections, Bethany.
They're allowed now.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.061
I ask the court to sanction
this rude, bitchy-do person.

18:24.144 --> 18:27.231
Counsel, just ask your questions and try
not to give in to your good nature.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.067
You are aware, sir,

18:30.150 --> 18:33.112
that baby boomers make up a big part
of your listening audience?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.114
I am. The irony is--

18:35.197 --> 18:36.740
I'm not interested in irony.

18:36.824 --> 18:40.035
I find nothing ironic
about calling for the genocide

18:40.119 --> 18:41.745
of an entire class of people.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.997
You sure like to come on strong,
don't you?

18:44.081 --> 18:46.500
Better to be a cannon
than get shot out of one.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.210
(snickers)

18:49.211 --> 18:50.504
I saw that.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.423
I want this entire transcript expedited,

18:53.507 --> 18:56.844
so that I can personally deliver it
to the Anti-Defamation League,

18:56.927 --> 18:59.805
which at this moment
is probably listening to a recording

18:59.888 --> 19:02.558
of this man's jihad against the elderly.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.518
All right, I've heard enough
of your little self.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.728
How about you and I both refrain

19:06.812 --> 19:09.148
from commenting on the other's size?

19:12.776 --> 19:16.613
Bring it on, Judgy-do.
I'm not going anywhere.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.287
What do you mean,
there's something up with her?

19:23.370 --> 19:25.247
You don't think there's anything
suspicious about her?

19:25.330 --> 19:27.958
-Because she said 999?
-WHITNEY: You're right.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.627
Hey, Clarence.
I've got a friend at the IRS,

19:30.711 --> 19:32.754
I had him do a little search
on her tax records.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.882
Dates back seven years and stops.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.216
She never filed before that.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.511
-Maybe she didn't work before then.
-Ever? (scoffs) And it gets better.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.263
You don't say "hey" back?

19:41.638 --> 19:46.143
She graduated law school
from the University of Chicago in 1999.

19:46.226 --> 19:49.438
In her resume, it says
she attended Georgetown before that.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.773
Georgetown has no record
of any Lorraine Weller.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.735
I ran a Social Security records search.

19:54.818 --> 19:58.447
No evidence of her prior to attending
the University of Chicago.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.573
I never trusted her.

20:01.491 --> 20:03.869
So, then the question becomes,
if she's not Lorraine Weller...

20:04.494 --> 20:05.412
Who is she?

20:14.046 --> 20:16.465
Look, these are the signals.
I didn't make 'em up.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.051
He looked under the stall,
moved his foot to the side,

20:19.134 --> 20:21.803
then his bag, tapped his foot and hummed.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.473
-Come on.
-At that point, you moved in?

20:24.556 --> 20:27.392
We asked him to step out of the stall,
and then we arrested him.

20:27.684 --> 20:31.021
Why didn't you wait for him
to do something more definitive?

20:31.104 --> 20:32.731
What he'd already done was definitive.

20:32.814 --> 20:35.859
Okay. Suppose somebody
was just out looking for some action?

20:35.943 --> 20:37.653
Not prostitution, but action.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.321
They hear that there might be
some in the bathroom and--

20:39.404 --> 20:41.573
I mean, is that a crime now,
to hit on somebody?

20:41.657 --> 20:43.784
These were known signals for prostitution.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.577
But you didn't wait
for money to change hands.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.663
-We felt we had enough to go on.
-Oh, come on.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.998
So, if someone has a bag in his hand,

20:50.082 --> 20:52.292
a tune in his head and needs to poop,
he better watch out.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.045
Commit the wrong ambiguous gesture,
and he's looking at the slammer.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.505
I guess they play
a lot of footsie in there.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.090
-Objection.
-Sustained.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.926
Your Honor, at this time I move
for a directed finding of not guilty.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.344
The prosecution has failed to meet

21:02.427 --> 21:03.804
-its burden of proof.
-Denied!

21:05.180 --> 21:07.849
Okay. I move to remove you
on the grounds of horrible judging.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.269
-There's a pattern of it actually.
-Denied!

21:10.352 --> 21:11.770
Judge, I've seen you go
in that men's room.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.360
What do you mean you might lose?

21:19.987 --> 21:23.073
Well, I should win.
They've got no transaction, but...

21:23.156 --> 21:24.032
But what?

21:24.449 --> 21:25.284
(exhales)

21:28.787 --> 21:30.247
I have to put Denny on the stand.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.248
(groans)

21:32.457 --> 21:35.711
-Is there any way around that?
-I don't think so.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.671
At this point, he's gotta tell his story,

21:37.754 --> 21:39.756
and, in doing so, he would then become...

21:41.925 --> 21:42.801
our defense.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.095
Dear God.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.777
I had terrible, terrible gas.
I have it a lot.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.654
ALAN: So, what did you do?

22:02.738 --> 22:05.866
Well, I went into the bathroom
hoping to relieve it with a, um...

22:05.949 --> 22:07.242
uh, bowel movement.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.245
-I have them a lot.
-Denny? Please.

22:10.954 --> 22:14.082
Upon entering the men's room,
I, uh, farted.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.001
-Uh, I do that a--
-Denny?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.588
DENNY: So, I entered a vacant stall,

22:19.671 --> 22:22.049
and I proceeded to do my business.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.801
Only I was constipated,
so I had difficulty.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.806
Did you engage in all these signals
they've been talking about?

22:29.890 --> 22:32.809
Well, I-I slid my briefcase
out of the way.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.519
And moved my foot to the side

22:34.603 --> 22:37.314
because I like to give myself
a wide berth when I'm impacted.

22:37.814 --> 22:40.609
Then I, uh, began to hum,

22:40.692 --> 22:43.070
uh, 'cause it's a--
It's a relaxing technique.

22:43.153 --> 22:47.407
And then I started tapping my foot
to give my hum a beat.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.451
(humming and tapping foot rhythmically)

22:52.913 --> 22:55.415
So, you didn't go into the bathroom
looking for sex?

22:55.499 --> 22:56.583
Oh, God, no.

22:56.666 --> 22:59.795
Oh, I've-I've had sex
in bathroom stalls before,

22:59.878 --> 23:00.879
sometimes for money.

23:00.962 --> 23:04.966
But always, always with a woman.
I'm a heterosexual.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.178
And I think being gay is a sin.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.098
It's against God.
It's against the president.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.641
And it's bad for the troops.

23:12.724 --> 23:16.103
How could the police officer
misinterpret it?

23:16.186 --> 23:19.481
Because he's an idiot.
And by the way, I have gay friends.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.817
And they like to look
at the merchandise just like anybody else.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.027
They're not gonna just have sex

23:24.111 --> 23:26.154
with whoever in the next stall,

23:26.530 --> 23:27.531
sight unseen.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.534
They may be sick, but they're not stupid.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.871
It's just a total coincidence

23:34.955 --> 23:38.291
that you engaged
in all these known signals to have sex?

23:38.375 --> 23:41.670
Well, not known to me. You say you know.
(chuckles) You gay?

23:43.004 --> 23:45.257
I am, as a matter of fact.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.217
Does that make a difference?

23:48.343 --> 23:50.679
Well, a big one
if I were looking to get laid.

23:50.762 --> 23:53.098
-You would never sleep with a man?
-Never.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.517
Never have a sleepover with a male friend?

23:56.768 --> 23:57.602
Well, that's different.

23:57.686 --> 24:01.022
In fact, you've had sleepovers
with your lawyer, Alan Shore.

24:01.106 --> 24:01.982
-Isn't that right?
-Objection.

24:02.065 --> 24:05.318
-Never had sex.
-You sleep in the same bed as...

24:05.402 --> 24:07.487
-buddies?
-Yeah.

24:07.571 --> 24:11.533
And you two have special time
every night together on your balcony,

24:11.616 --> 24:13.410
-is that right?
-What's wrong with that?

24:13.493 --> 24:15.912
You refer to each other as...

24:16.580 --> 24:17.956
"flamingos."

24:19.583 --> 24:21.668
-Did you tell him this?
-I didn't. What's the point?

24:21.751 --> 24:22.627
This is irrelevant.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.921
It's called male bonding.
You never heard of that?

24:25.005 --> 24:27.591
Oh, I know all about male bonding.

24:27.674 --> 24:30.385
Now let me see if I get this.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.680
You're a man who sleeps with other men,

24:33.763 --> 24:36.057
you just so happened to signal another man

24:36.141 --> 24:37.684
to have sex with you in a bathroom,

24:37.767 --> 24:39.686
but it's all just a big coincidence.

24:39.769 --> 24:42.772
You sometimes refer
to yourself as a flamingo.

24:43.523 --> 24:44.649
But you're not gay.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.359
Damn right I'm not.

24:48.778 --> 24:50.030
I think I get the picture.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.365
Nothing further.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.467
Oh! (exhales)

25:10.926 --> 25:12.511
Good heavens. You frightened me.

25:12.594 --> 25:15.096
Just now, or do I frighten you
in general, Katie?

25:16.556 --> 25:18.058
You've been quite a curious girl.

25:19.768 --> 25:20.852
What's going on, Katie?

25:21.228 --> 25:23.104
What's going on is,
you're not who you say you are.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.982
I know I've seen your face.
I don't know your real identity,

25:26.066 --> 25:28.443
but I know you've only been
Lorraine Weller since 1997,

25:28.527 --> 25:30.654
when you entered
the University of Chicago Law School.

25:34.157 --> 25:37.118
-So you know my secret.
-No, I only know part of it.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.288
-I used to be somebody else.
-Who?

25:40.914 --> 25:43.458
I'm not gonna tell you that.
It could cost me my life.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.464
I married a man from Pakistan
12 years ago.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.676
I was unfaithful to him,
which he discovered.

25:52.759 --> 25:56.221
There had been several honor killings
in Muslim communities in London.

25:56.721 --> 25:57.681
I am from London.

25:58.265 --> 26:01.518
My co-adulterer was killed
in an automobile accident.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.728
I believed the next accident
was going to happen to me,

26:03.812 --> 26:07.232
so I fled London, changed my name,
began a new life here.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.360
I'm told by my friends
my husband's still looking for me.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.487
Does Alan Shore know this?

26:12.571 --> 26:15.115
No, and I would beg you not to tell him.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.202
It's a business, Judge.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.912
Talk shows, news shows,

26:20.996 --> 26:23.582
they're all in it
for the same thing, money.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.334
If he wants to insult people, fine.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.295
But it better be good for sales.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.421
Howard Stern is funny.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.715
People like him.
He could say what he wants.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.967
Don Imus? Not so funny.

26:34.050 --> 26:36.303
And "nappy" hair
was bad for the bottom line.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.597
It's the same thing here.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.891
WWEN was faced with advertiser pullout

26:41.975 --> 26:43.602
because of what Bob Binder said.

26:43.685 --> 26:44.936
And by the way,

26:45.020 --> 26:47.105
what's wrong with cleaning up
the airwaves a little?

26:47.522 --> 26:49.524
I'm sick of these so-called journalists

26:49.608 --> 26:51.776
cloaking their hate mongering and bigotry

26:51.860 --> 26:54.529
in the American flag
and calling it free speech.

26:55.155 --> 26:57.532
Why can't a radio station fire an employee

26:57.616 --> 27:00.118
for spewing out despicably immoral crap?

27:00.869 --> 27:03.413
Maybe that's what Americans
are really calling for here.

27:04.205 --> 27:05.165
About time.

27:07.208 --> 27:10.754
Was what my client said really so bad?

27:11.212 --> 27:14.257
It's interesting.
She mentions Howard Stern.

27:14.341 --> 27:18.303
My client was asked by his station
to be more like Howard.

27:18.386 --> 27:20.347
Howard Stern asked on the air,

27:20.430 --> 27:23.308
"So if you're half Arab and half Jewish,

27:23.391 --> 27:24.809
do you negotiate with the sheep

27:24.893 --> 27:27.187
before having sexual relations with them?"

27:27.270 --> 27:29.064
She also mentions Don Imus.

27:29.147 --> 27:33.526
Viacom seems to have no problem
with Imus referring to Arabs as ragheads.

27:33.610 --> 27:37.614
In 2004, he referred to Simon &amp; Schuster,
the book publishers,

27:37.697 --> 27:39.824
as "Jews who steal."

27:39.908 --> 27:43.620
Then he apologized for the remark
as being redundant.

27:44.329 --> 27:48.416
Uh, Glenn Beck. He's on CNN,
the most trusted name in news.

27:48.792 --> 27:52.003
He's referred
to the Katrina survivors as...

27:52.379 --> 27:54.464
a vulgarity I'm not allowed
to repeat here.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.841
He also said he didn't think it possible

27:56.925 --> 28:00.387
to hate any victims
faster than the 9/11 victims.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.348
These so-called journalists
are everywhere,

28:03.431 --> 28:06.101
and frankly, I wouldn't mind
seeing most of them gone.

28:06.184 --> 28:10.772
But it's one thing to curtail racist
or hateful remarks.

28:10.855 --> 28:14.943
It's quite another
to censor political content.

28:15.902 --> 28:18.321
What Bob Binder said
may have been offensive,

28:18.405 --> 28:21.783
but it was also legitimate public debate,

28:21.866 --> 28:25.870
ironically one the public
and the presidential candidates

28:25.954 --> 28:27.580
refuse to engage in.

28:27.956 --> 28:32.419
If the older demographic
has more economic power

28:32.502 --> 28:35.714
to affect the outcome
of the presidential elections,

28:35.797 --> 28:38.550
and the government
is spending most of its money

28:38.633 --> 28:40.301
on the older demographic...

28:41.636 --> 28:44.514
gee, shouldn't somebody
be discussing this?

28:46.141 --> 28:49.102
A press, a free press,

28:49.185 --> 28:51.980
has always been vital to a democracy.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.816
Not just when they serve the bottom line,

28:54.899 --> 28:58.611
but perhaps especially when it doesn't.

29:00.238 --> 29:04.200
Your Honor,
reporters actually lost their jobs

29:04.284 --> 29:06.161
for criticizing the war.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.414
Thirty-five percent of today's journalists

29:09.497 --> 29:12.417
say newsworthy stories
are sometimes shunned

29:12.500 --> 29:16.421
if they'll hurt the financial interests
of their news organizations.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.467
In America? Our free press?

29:23.428 --> 29:27.807
This man got fired from a news talk show

29:27.891 --> 29:31.352
for expressing a political idea.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.565
Are we really okay with that?

29:38.109 --> 29:38.943
Really?

30:01.090 --> 30:07.555
Look, we have a lot of this illicit,
illegal, and, yes, immoral activity,

30:07.639 --> 30:11.684
going on not behind closed doors,
but in public areas.

30:12.268 --> 30:14.270
Kids go in these bathrooms sometimes.

30:14.354 --> 30:18.650
Are we gonna look the other way
just because he is Denny Crane?

30:18.733 --> 30:19.984
I mean, come on.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.987
He went in, looked under the stall,

30:23.071 --> 30:25.782
saw somebody, entered the adjacent stall,

30:25.865 --> 30:27.534
pushed his briefcase forward,

30:27.617 --> 30:31.162
slid his foot over, tapped his foot,
then the humming.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.289
By coincidence?

30:36.751 --> 30:37.627
This is shameful.

30:38.378 --> 30:42.632
Even more so if we excuse it
just because he is a high-profile lawyer

30:42.715 --> 30:44.968
who thinks
that he should be above the law.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.733
(whispering) Alan, don't save the world.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.402
Just get me off. Can you do that, please?

31:03.027 --> 31:04.195
ALAN: Denny, when you hold my hand,

31:04.279 --> 31:07.699
it's just as thrilling
as the very first time,

31:07.782 --> 31:09.409
but the jury could get the wrong idea.

31:16.082 --> 31:20.128
I'm sorry.
I never heard of much gay prostitution

31:20.211 --> 31:22.046
going on in men's rooms.

31:22.130 --> 31:25.800
I mean, maybe in a park or a club or--

31:26.301 --> 31:27.552
but in a courthouse?

31:28.219 --> 31:29.053
Huh.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.807
There's certainly a lot more
of the heterosexual kind

31:32.891 --> 31:35.852
going on elsewhere,
most of which we turn a blind eye to.

31:35.935 --> 31:38.229
There's even talk
of legalizing it in Vegas.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.982
So, is there something
especially offensive

31:41.065 --> 31:42.859
about gay prostitution?

31:43.568 --> 31:45.945
We know Washington
certainly feels that way.

31:46.029 --> 31:50.533
All those family-values senators
had nothing to say about David Vitter,

31:50.617 --> 31:53.995
the Louisiana senator
who was caught in a prostitution ring.

31:54.078 --> 31:57.415
I guess because he had the decency
to visit only female hookers.

31:57.498 --> 31:59.375
So, let me see.

32:01.669 --> 32:07.008
All right, we've got 29 current
or recent members of Congress

32:07.091 --> 32:08.801
accused of spousal abuse.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.679
Twenty-seven have been arrested
for driving under the influence.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.974
Nineteen current or recent members
accused of writing bad checks.

32:15.058 --> 32:18.353
Fourteen have drug-related arrests.
Eight busted for shoplifting.

32:18.436 --> 32:21.105
Seven for fraud.
Four for theft. Three for assault.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.524
But Larry Craig's the one
they simply must broom

32:23.608 --> 32:25.234
for tapping his foot in a men's room.

32:25.318 --> 32:28.404
And why are we paying the police
to tap back?

32:28.488 --> 32:30.406
With all this terror business,

32:30.490 --> 32:33.034
and these security crises
going on in airports,

32:33.117 --> 32:34.994
why are the police across the country

32:35.078 --> 32:37.038
manning bathroom stalls to play footsie?

32:38.247 --> 32:41.960
Mr. Shore, I shall ask you
to confine yourself to this case.

32:42.043 --> 32:45.964
I'm talking about this case.
Homophobia has run amok, Judge.

32:46.047 --> 32:49.258
It's the reason we're all gathered here,
and it's preposterous.

32:49.342 --> 32:52.470
We're actually sitting in a courtroom
wasting tax dollars

32:52.553 --> 32:55.181
because my client had gas,
he was constipated.

32:55.264 --> 32:57.934
He went to remedy his problem
in a bathroom, imagine that,

32:58.017 --> 33:00.728
where lo and behold,
three undercover police officers

33:00.812 --> 33:04.023
were lurking, waiting to interpret
a tapping foot as a call for gay sex.

33:05.191 --> 33:08.861
Now... maybe Larry Craig
deserved his fate.

33:08.945 --> 33:10.863
He was thrown in front of the very bus
he helped to build.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.116
But Denny Crane doesn't deserve this.

33:13.199 --> 33:14.701
All he was trying to do was take a crap.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.202
(scattered murmuring)

33:23.418 --> 33:26.462
And even if one were
to go there looking for sex,

33:26.546 --> 33:27.964
there's no law against that.

33:28.047 --> 33:31.050
The crime is soliciting for a fee.

33:31.134 --> 33:34.095
This complaint doesn't even allege
that any money was involved.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.223
As my Great-aunt Gert used to say,

33:37.306 --> 33:39.892
"This smells funny,
and I'm not going to eat it."

33:52.864 --> 33:55.450
The First Amendment
applies to state action only.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.368
Not private companies.

33:57.452 --> 34:01.831
If a government punishes Mr. Binder
for saying what he did, that's censorship.

34:01.914 --> 34:05.918
When a private business does so,
it's editorial control.

34:06.502 --> 34:08.588
-This isn't going well.
-You say something, Miss Schmidt?

34:09.088 --> 34:11.674
If I did,
I'm sure it wasn't important, Your Honor.

34:12.508 --> 34:14.886
-However...
-There's the magic word.

34:14.969 --> 34:18.973
...corporations have become
the biggest infringers of free expression.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.516
It's been going on for years.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.477
Starting with cigarette companies

34:22.560 --> 34:24.395
who pull their advertising dollars

34:24.479 --> 34:27.774
from any publication
that runs an article on cancer.

34:28.191 --> 34:32.403
Beyond that, corporations
are using something called SLAPP suits

34:32.487 --> 34:34.030
to chill free speech.

34:34.113 --> 34:39.077
So, when it comes to truth
in this country, the fix is in.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.537
As for talk-show hosts,

34:41.621 --> 34:44.624
the public gets the opinion
the sponsors pay for.

34:44.707 --> 34:46.918
Your Honor, this is truly riveting.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.462
But can you just give us the ruling?

34:49.545 --> 34:51.172
Dwarves have limited life spans.

34:51.506 --> 34:54.550
Judgment for the petitioner.
That work for you?

34:56.010 --> 34:57.553
Are you on drugs?

34:57.637 --> 34:59.472
He was hired to be a provocateur.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.558
He said inflammatory things before.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.478
He was championed
by the station for doing so.

35:05.561 --> 35:09.607
I'm ruling in favor of the plaintiff
on an estoppel theory.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.819
Please don't take this personal,
pip-squeak.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.280
I want that on the record.

35:16.781 --> 35:20.284
You know, that robe doesn't give you
the authority or the right

35:20.368 --> 35:24.080
to demean me for my size,
you barrage balloon.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.918
Go ahead. What are you gonna do?

35:33.256 --> 35:35.466
-(door opens)
-(gate buzzing)

35:36.384 --> 35:37.218
(door closes)

35:42.014 --> 35:42.849
Bethany?

35:48.146 --> 35:50.857
That cannon remark
was really below the belt.

35:52.984 --> 35:53.818
I'm sorry.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.780
It wasn't my intent to...

35:58.865 --> 36:00.825
well, stoop to your level.

36:00.908 --> 36:02.743
And please don't take that the wrong way.

36:03.744 --> 36:04.579
It's just...

36:06.122 --> 36:10.168
you seem to push my buttons
for whatever reason.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.545
Not many people can do that.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.507
Is it because I was with Denny
and you still love him?

36:17.216 --> 36:20.178
It could be many things, but not that.

36:21.512 --> 36:25.057
The truth is, I bet... I could like you.

36:27.476 --> 36:29.645
Okay, not a chance.

36:30.646 --> 36:33.441
But I do tip my hat to you, Bethany.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.861
You really are something.

36:38.404 --> 36:39.238
Thank you.

36:42.074 --> 36:44.869
Well, have a good night.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.205
Until we meet again.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.333
Yes. Until.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.101
-A fatwa?
-Shh!

37:09.185 --> 37:11.229
Some Pakistani put a hit on her?

37:12.480 --> 37:15.274
That's what she said.
I have heard of these honor killings.

37:16.442 --> 37:18.110
-A fatwa?
-Keep your voice down.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.363
-She asked me to keep her confidence.
-I'm not keeping it.

37:20.446 --> 37:23.157
-Whitney.
-Suppose her ex-husband shows up here?

37:23.241 --> 37:25.201
I'm not going down in some fatwa.

37:25.284 --> 37:26.118
(knocking on door)

37:28.412 --> 37:29.413
Hello.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.831
-(door closes)
-Hello.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.083
How's it going?

37:32.500 --> 37:33.626
(sighing)

37:34.627 --> 37:36.128
-What's going on?
-WHITNEY: Oh, nothing.

37:36.212 --> 37:38.965
Just discussing the Patriots
and Red Sox...

37:39.048 --> 37:39.924
and fatwas.

37:43.302 --> 37:44.303
I'm disappointed.

37:44.804 --> 37:48.182
You're disappointed?
You put us all at risk, girl.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.810
What if your ex-Pakistani
blows up the building, hmm?

37:50.893 --> 37:53.229
That would really disappoint me.

37:53.312 --> 37:55.314
In fact, we'd all go to pieces.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.777
(in British accent)
I can't stop you revealing my secret,

37:59.860 --> 38:01.070
if that's what you choose to do,

38:01.153 --> 38:03.072
but you will jeopardize my life.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.459
A fatwa?

38:28.097 --> 38:30.725
Can you imagine,
of all the times I've beaten the rap,

38:31.517 --> 38:33.936
to be convicted of public gayness?

38:34.270 --> 38:36.439
I'll be forced to un-register
as a Republican.

38:36.522 --> 38:39.150
Republicans would have no problem
with you being gay, Denny,

38:39.233 --> 38:41.569
so long as you continue
to persecute homosexuals.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.070
I hope you're right.

38:43.821 --> 38:47.074
Madam Foreperson,
the jury's verdict is unanimous?

38:47.158 --> 38:50.161
-Yes, Your Honor.
-The defendant will please rise.

38:52.455 --> 38:53.914
Madam Foreperson, what say you?

38:53.998 --> 38:56.459
We find the defendant, Denny Crane...

38:57.585 --> 38:58.544
not guilty.

38:58.627 --> 39:00.546
(people murmuring)

39:01.797 --> 39:04.717
-Oh, thank God.
-Congratulations, Denny.

39:05.092 --> 39:07.970
Uh, could Your Honor find
as a matter of law that I am not gay?

39:09.055 --> 39:10.348
Denied!

39:10.973 --> 39:13.017
-(gavel pounds)
-Adjourned.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.311
ALAN: You must be deeply relieved.

39:15.394 --> 39:16.645
Oh, I could hug you.

39:17.271 --> 39:19.357
-But I might get arrested.
-Hug me anyway.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.193
-Mr. Crane?
-(camera shutter clicks)

39:26.322 --> 39:28.282
-REPORTER: Could we get a statement?
-(reporters clamoring)

39:28.366 --> 39:30.659
Not gay, not guilty.

39:38.876 --> 39:42.046
Tell me the truth. Wouldn't you hate it
if people thought you were gay?

39:44.590 --> 39:49.178
Well, I'd hate the idea of being perceived
as deceitful or dishonest.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.264
As for sexual orientation, I...

39:54.642 --> 39:56.936
Women are much less guarded
around gay men, Denny.

39:57.853 --> 40:00.022
You could endear yourself
as a bit of a Trojan horse

40:00.106 --> 40:01.690
before surprising them with your...

40:02.358 --> 40:03.651
Trojan.

40:04.735 --> 40:05.945
I never thought of that.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.698
This could be an advantage. (chuckles)

40:14.120 --> 40:15.913
Thank you, Alan.

40:16.831 --> 40:21.001
I'm not crazy about you lumping me
with that closet Democrat from Idaho,

40:21.085 --> 40:21.961
-but--
-(scoffs)

40:23.879 --> 40:24.922
Still, thank you.

40:26.715 --> 40:30.553
Can you believe the DA
tried to exploit us for being flamingos?

40:30.636 --> 40:32.388
Oh, ridiculous.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.433
Thank God he didn't find out
we like to dress up

40:35.516 --> 40:37.101
-as the Lennon Sisters.
-(chuckles)

40:38.644 --> 40:41.063
He actually tried
to shame us for our sleepovers.

40:41.313 --> 40:42.314
Bigot!

40:42.606 --> 40:44.233
Those homosexuals,

40:44.316 --> 40:47.153
can't stand the thought
of legitimate male bonding.

40:47.236 --> 40:48.904
-Where's the tolerance?
-Mmm.

40:49.697 --> 40:53.367
Oh, did you hear
Shirley went up against Bethany?

40:54.368 --> 40:55.911
-No.
-Uh-huh.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.289
Mmm.

40:58.372 --> 41:00.708
God, it's been so long
since I've had sex with a dwarf.

41:02.001 --> 41:02.835
Me, too.

41:05.379 --> 41:06.338
Me, too.

41:06.839 --> 41:08.466
It's the little things, Alan.

41:08.549 --> 41:09.967
(laughs)

41:10.050 --> 41:11.427
We gotta stop working so much.

41:11.510 --> 41:13.345
Maybe if you could stop getting arrested.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.139
I'm the problem?

41:15.222 --> 41:18.851
Well, you have been causing
a fair amount of trouble lately.

41:20.269 --> 41:21.103
(sighs)

41:21.937 --> 41:23.439
Do you think I've lived the evil life?

41:23.522 --> 41:24.857
(scoffs)

41:24.940 --> 41:27.610
I womanize, I drink, I break the law.

41:27.943 --> 41:31.155
And now, to be mistaken for a-a...

41:33.240 --> 41:36.952
Well, you get to be my age,
you worry about the afterlife...

41:38.370 --> 41:39.455
where you're heading.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.459
You ever think about those things?

41:46.003 --> 41:46.962
Sometimes.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.299
Then I remember what Mark Twain said.

41:50.382 --> 41:52.885
"You go to heaven for the climate,
but to hell for the company" so...

41:53.636 --> 41:55.346
(chuckles)
No matter what, in the end...

41:55.930 --> 41:56.931
We'll be together.

41:57.598 --> 42:00.809
-Indeed.
-Soul mates in hell. I love it.

42:01.143 --> 42:01.977
(Alan chuckles)

42:05.481 --> 42:07.399
Bet they have dwarves in hell.

42:07.858 --> 42:09.026
How could they not?

42:11.570 --> 42:13.614
Suddenly I'm less afraid of death.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.325
ALAN: There you go.

42:31.715 --> 42:32.883
NARRATOR: <i>Next on</i> Boston Legal...

42:32.967 --> 42:34.385
I'm considering going back to New York.

42:34.468 --> 42:36.929
Carl, come on.
This is just like any other firm.

42:37.012 --> 42:38.347
The things that go on here.

42:38.430 --> 42:40.474
The bailiff will take Mr. Shore
and Mr. Crane into custody

42:40.558 --> 42:42.643
for contempt of court and country!

42:42.726 --> 42:44.103
I'm gonna join the National Guard.

42:44.186 --> 42:45.771
I'm afraid neither of you can join.

42:45.854 --> 42:47.314
We want to shoot people.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.693
I can't figure out why you would sign on
for high profile cases.

42:50.776 --> 42:53.862
Just seems odd for somebody
who's got a fatwa against her.

42:53.946 --> 42:56.073
I am in big trouble, Grammy.

42:56.156 --> 42:58.409
Okay. Is it me,
or is that little thing hot?

42:58.492 --> 43:01.078
You're right, Shirley.
Just like any other firm.

43:03.330 --> 43:05.541
(theme music playing)
