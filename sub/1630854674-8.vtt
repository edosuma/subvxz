00:01.218 --> 00:02.698
<i>Previously on</i> Will Trent...

00:02.698 --> 00:03.916
Any chance the two of you
are expecting?

00:03.916 --> 00:05.483
Ha! We're not together.

00:05.483 --> 00:08.486
And I am definitely
not having sex,

00:08.486 --> 00:10.749
so unless God Himself
is cooking up a plan, then...

00:10.749 --> 00:12.534
not pregnant.

00:12.534 --> 00:15.058
I got cigarette burns
for fetching

00:15.058 --> 00:17.321
the wrong kind of soup
from the pantry.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.062
Every step of the way,
there was someone there

00:19.062 --> 00:22.848
to tell me that
I was broken, worthless.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.208
...had a chem paper...

00:42.477 --> 00:43.782
Alison.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.656
Jason, please. Look, I'm tired.

00:47.656 --> 00:50.354
I've been studying all night.
I just want to go home.

00:50.354 --> 00:51.399
I'm not doing this right now.

01:11.462 --> 01:14.074
Hello? Jason?

01:21.385 --> 01:23.605
Who's there?

01:23.605 --> 01:24.823
Look, I have pepper spray.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.749
It's all yours, Detective.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.101
Alison Schooner.

02:25.101 --> 02:26.842
They pulled her
out of the water.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.626
She was weighted down
by a cinder block.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.454
- Who reported it?
- Couple of professors,

02:30.454 --> 02:32.456
out for their morning nine.

02:32.456 --> 02:36.417
They saw the shoes.
I.D. and suicide note inside.

02:36.417 --> 02:37.853
"I want it to end."

02:39.246 --> 02:40.812
Well, that's pretty direct.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.031
Excuse me. Agents?

02:42.031 --> 02:44.120
I'm Vera Kuo,
University Chancellor.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.469
Thank you for coming.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.428
A campus suicide
is a terrible tragedy.

02:47.428 --> 02:50.300
My hope is that we can
stay ahead of the narrative.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.694
I'm not convinced
this is suicide.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.478
I thought she left a note.

02:54.478 --> 02:55.740
The note's one sentence long,

02:55.740 --> 02:57.829
written on a torn
piece of paper.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.223
Women usually take more care
for their last words.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.747
Their letters are longer,
written with much more detail.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.227
They want to explain themselves.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.490
That's a generalization, right?

03:06.490 --> 03:08.666
Can't suicide
be a rash decision?

03:08.666 --> 03:10.277
Well, sometimes, yeah,
but carrying a cinder block

03:10.277 --> 03:12.279
to the middle of a golf course
to drown yourself,

03:12.279 --> 03:13.497
that's not rash.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.543
That shows planning.

03:15.543 --> 03:18.807
Hang on. Unzip the bag.
I'd like to take another look.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.724
See anything?

03:22.724 --> 03:24.856
There's something on her neck.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.864
What the hell?

03:32.864 --> 03:34.388
Something got under the skin.

03:36.912 --> 03:39.741
Oh. Oh, my God.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.525
I'm gonna faint.

03:42.570 --> 03:43.745
Somebody tend to the chancellor.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.137
We're on it.

03:45.137 --> 03:47.096
Stab wound is barely visible.

03:47.096 --> 03:48.837
Weapon must've been sharp.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.933
Over there. On the bark.
You see it?

03:57.933 --> 03:59.848
Bark can act like a sponge.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.284
The tree's still soaking wet

04:01.284 --> 04:03.243
from the sprinklers
this morning,

04:03.243 --> 04:06.246
but blood really is thicker
than water.

04:09.727 --> 04:12.600
Whoever did this
probably thought

04:12.600 --> 04:14.819
the, uh, the sprinklers,
the pond

04:14.819 --> 04:16.299
would wash away any evidence.

04:16.299 --> 04:19.346
They had the note,
the cinder block, all of it.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.479
They were waiting for her.

04:33.316 --> 04:36.058
Well, only cameras are
at the entrances and exits.

04:36.058 --> 04:38.147
All visitors and staff
have to sign in and out,

04:38.147 --> 04:40.802
and no one has signed out
since last night.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.891
So the killer's still here?

04:42.891 --> 04:44.414
This is like
an Agatha Christie novel.

04:44.414 --> 04:47.069
Yeah, with very soft food.
And hearing aids.

04:47.069 --> 04:50.420
So, forensics didn't find
any prints on the sword,

04:50.420 --> 04:52.074
wallet's still in his pocket,

04:52.074 --> 04:54.163
but no phone,
not even in his car.

04:54.163 --> 04:56.513
Yeah, send a team to his house.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.254
Uh-- Ms. Hernandez?

04:58.254 --> 05:00.474
So, when you found him,
he was just like this?

05:00.474 --> 05:02.476
He was setting up.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.348
Um, Steve's a regular
entertainer here.

05:05.348 --> 05:08.699
"Morning Magic with
Steve Susperio," every Thursday.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.920
- Hm.
- He was fine when I left him,

05:11.920 --> 05:14.444
and when folks started coming in
to the performance,

05:14.444 --> 05:16.359
he was gone.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.143
Poof.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.321
Poof.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.628
What could the motive
possibly be?

05:24.628 --> 05:26.238
He was here to do magic.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.588
That's motive enough for me.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.025
He's still here?

05:31.548 --> 05:33.420
Does that mean there's not
gonna be any figure drawing?

05:33.420 --> 05:35.813
Oh. Barry, Linda,
go back to your rooms, okay?

05:35.813 --> 05:37.119
I don't want you to see this.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.600
Well, that one
can take his shirt off.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.688
Linda!

05:42.951 --> 05:44.518
They didn't seem
particularly fazed.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.041
I'm guessing
this won't be the first body

05:46.041 --> 05:47.347
they've seen
wheeled out of here.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.914
Hey. What's that?

05:55.224 --> 05:57.792
What is it? A tripod?
His phone was here.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.533
We gotta search the place.

05:59.533 --> 06:00.882
I'll start on the warrant.

06:02.579 --> 06:05.016
Nancy? Can I keep him?

06:13.285 --> 06:14.330
Is this her room?

06:14.330 --> 06:15.679
Yeah, right here.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.944
There are seven of you
in this house?

06:19.944 --> 06:21.990
Helps keep it affordable.

06:21.990 --> 06:25.428
The lease is under my name.
Dwayne Gilbert.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.864
This is so surreal.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.779
I'm actually
a criminal justice major.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.172
Isn't that weird?

06:30.999 --> 06:32.957
Third year.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.350
4.2 grade point average.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.612
Impressive.

06:35.612 --> 06:36.744
Stay at the threshold, please.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.223
Yep.

06:41.662 --> 06:44.491
What's with all the padlocks?

06:44.491 --> 06:46.014
She grew up in the system.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.371
You mean foster care?

06:55.371 --> 06:57.547
This is just how my rooms
used to be.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.767
Kept all my stuff close.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.553
Always sure someone was
gonna try to take my things.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.861
Treated every home
like it was temporary.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.080
Wow. That makes so much sense.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.648
I really didn't know
much about her.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.868
She was quiet, clean,

07:13.868 --> 07:17.175
mostly kept to herself,
studied a lot.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.612
Do you know
if she had a boyfriend?

07:18.612 --> 07:20.004
Oh, yeah, 'cause it's always
the boyfriend, right?

07:20.004 --> 07:21.266
You want to be an investigator?

07:21.266 --> 07:23.791
Here's a tip-- pay attention.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.619
Learn about the people
you're living with.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.447
Y-You're right. Good advice.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.013
We can take it from here, Dwayne.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.625
We'll let you know
if we need anything.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.542
Handwriting's the same
as the suicide note.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.719
Killer must have ripped it out
from something the victim wrote.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.590
Explains why the note was torn.

07:46.944 --> 07:48.859
Can I help you?

07:50.078 --> 07:51.819
Oh, he's running.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.698
Get up. Get up.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.526
Hands on the fence. Don't move.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.931
What's with the knife, huh?

08:16.931 --> 08:19.542
It's a fettling knife.
For sculpting!

08:19.542 --> 08:21.065
- Did you use it to kill Alison?!
- No!

08:21.065 --> 08:22.632
- Let go of me!
- Why'd you run, then?

08:22.632 --> 08:23.894
- Will!
- Why'd you run?

08:23.894 --> 08:26.331
- Aah! I wasn't--
- Oh, my God.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.075
Keep him on his side.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.516
I need an ambulance, now.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.653
We have witnesses that say
you were out of control.

08:43.653 --> 08:44.915
What, you hit his head?

08:44.915 --> 08:46.787
Help him "fall to the
ground" a few times?

08:46.787 --> 08:48.223
What? Of course not.

08:48.223 --> 08:50.268
The kid's name is Milo Braham.

08:50.268 --> 08:51.835
He's a senior from Savannah,

08:51.835 --> 08:54.838
and his very wealthy parents
have luckily decided not to sue.

08:54.838 --> 08:57.319
You were right.
Victim grew up in the system.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.540
Doesn't give you permission
to put a boy in the hospital.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.587
I don't know what caused
that seizure, but it wasn't me.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.546
Well, let's hope the kid
makes a full recovery...

09:06.546 --> 09:08.156
or he's the killer.

09:08.156 --> 09:10.898
I'm fine either way.

09:14.162 --> 09:17.948
Jeremy, you know
I can't talk about the case.

09:17.948 --> 09:20.864
But listen to me.
It was an isolated event.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.692
The only thing
that could put you in danger

09:22.692 --> 09:25.260
is me finding out that
you're not going to class.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.174
Yeah.

09:28.176 --> 09:31.745
I gotta go now. Be good, please.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.225
You're Agent Mitchell.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.401
- I was sent to find you.
- Hi.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.621
How have you been? Numbers okay?

09:38.621 --> 09:39.840
You find a good endocrinologist?

09:39.840 --> 09:41.102
You remember that?

09:42.016 --> 09:43.060
I remember you.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.282
Uh, the young man we brought
in today, Milo Braham?

09:47.282 --> 09:48.762
Yes. Right.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.981
Uh, he's stable but suffered
some head trauma

09:50.981 --> 09:52.330
when he hit the concrete.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.028
He's been put in
a medically induced coma

09:54.028 --> 09:55.899
to prevent brain swelling.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.379
No history of epilepsy.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.076
We're trying to figure out
the cause of the seizure.

09:59.076 --> 10:01.949
Gotcha. He is a person of
interest in a murder case.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.820
I'll leave a guard
out front of his room,

10:03.820 --> 10:05.474
but would you please let me know

10:05.474 --> 10:06.823
if anything changes
in his condition?

10:06.823 --> 10:08.346
Of course. Of course.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.392
In fact...

10:10.392 --> 10:13.090
this is my personal
mobile number.

10:14.788 --> 10:17.486
How's your, uh, diabetes?

10:17.486 --> 10:20.054
You taking regular meals?

10:20.054 --> 10:22.709
I'm sorry. What does that mean?

10:23.971 --> 10:26.408
It means I'm an idiot.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.671
I'm trying to ascertain if you'd
like to get a meal with me.

10:28.671 --> 10:31.239
Oh!

10:31.239 --> 10:33.633
Right. Yes.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.504
I eat dinner. I do.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.027
Um, and, yes,
that would be great.

10:37.027 --> 10:39.203
I'm eating dinner
with my son tonight,

10:39.203 --> 10:40.291
but sometime, yes.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.728
Yes, yes.

10:41.728 --> 10:42.816
You have a son?

10:42.816 --> 10:44.687
- He's 18.
- Oh.

10:44.687 --> 10:45.862
But I'm 33.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.734
- Great.
- I had him when I was young.

10:47.734 --> 10:48.865
Okay.

10:48.865 --> 10:49.953
But it was consensual.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.651
Well, that's a relief.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.914
Yeah, we were young and dumb,
and it was the first time, too.

10:53.914 --> 10:56.264
Can you believe that?
But everything's good now.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.309
No more accidental
pregnancies for me.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.836
Okay.
I'm gonna go now, Doctor...

11:02.836 --> 11:03.924
Farhad, please.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.360
Mm. Yeah.

11:06.448 --> 11:08.798
Looking forward
to speaking again.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.408
Are you sure?

11:11.235 --> 11:12.367
Mnh.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.898
I did a basic tox screen.

11:21.898 --> 11:23.378
Nothing showed up,
but I did notice

11:23.378 --> 11:24.988
her liver enzymes were elevated.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.468
Although, elevated
liver enzymes can also be

11:26.468 --> 11:28.426
a side effect of heavy drinking,

11:28.426 --> 11:30.733
so it's not that unheard of
for a college student.

11:39.176 --> 11:42.614
You're gonna let him say that?

11:42.614 --> 11:45.269
You know I wasn't a partier.
I had two jobs.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.794
I had a partial scholarship,
so my grades couldn't slip.

11:50.579 --> 11:54.235
No one was helping me.

12:01.633 --> 12:04.245
I need that plastic container
we, uh, bagged

12:04.245 --> 12:06.769
brought down to autopsy
as soon as possible.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.424
Alison Schooner
wasn't a drinker.

12:09.424 --> 12:12.079
Whatever you say.
Also, see this?

12:12.079 --> 12:15.865
Knife entered here, went
directly to the carotid artery,

12:15.865 --> 12:18.868
and then was twisted to ensure
the artery was severed.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.957
This killer knew what
they were doing. I think--

12:20.957 --> 12:22.480
They were a hunter.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.656
Aww. I love it when we finish
each other's sentences.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.268
That's how you drain a deer.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.009
Well, this is Georgia.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.619
It doesn't narrow it down much.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.405
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.233
Found this
in the victim's backpack.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.845
Water dissolved whatever was
inside, messed up the label,

12:38.845 --> 12:41.804
but it's still not from
the student health center.

12:41.804 --> 12:44.676
No name, no words.
Just a bunch of numbers.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.330
This is from
a pharmaceutical trial.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.551
- You sure?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.553
Universities are a hub
for drug research.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.511
Studies need healthy,
young participants.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.817
Students need money.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.427
Well, our victim did need money.

12:56.427 --> 12:58.038
How much do participants
get paid?

12:58.038 --> 13:00.823
Sometimes as much as
a few thousand, depending.

13:15.403 --> 13:19.276
Respectfully,
I did not stab the magician.

13:19.276 --> 13:21.757
Sure. Uh, how long
has Steve been coming here?

13:21.757 --> 13:23.715
A few years, at least.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.108
Any chance he started up
a relationship

13:25.108 --> 13:28.155
with one of the residents?
Linda, maybe?

13:28.155 --> 13:29.896
- Linda?
- She's very flirty.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.333
I sincerely doubt that.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.204
What about the staff?
Uh, does anyone have

13:34.204 --> 13:36.337
a history of violence,
a criminal record?

13:37.120 --> 13:38.426
Yes.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.863
So, Ernesto,
disorderly conduct, 2019.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.125
You want to tell us about that?

13:42.125 --> 13:44.562
Got a little too rowdy
at a bar one night.

13:44.562 --> 13:47.087
I mean, what can I say?
The Falcons were winning.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.219
Someone heard you shouting
at Steve last time he was here.

13:49.219 --> 13:51.439
Yeah, I was shouting at Steve.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.136
Uh, he made my wedding ring reappear

13:53.136 --> 13:55.486
inside of a sealed bag
of Pepperidge Farm cookies.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.880
- I mean, geez.
- Chessmen or Milanos?

13:57.880 --> 13:58.707
Oh. Milano.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.536
That's pretty good.

14:01.536 --> 14:02.798
Yeah, I kept telling him--

14:02.798 --> 14:04.278
I was like, "Steve,
you have got to get on

14:04.278 --> 14:05.757
'America's Next
Great Entertainer.'"

14:05.757 --> 14:07.237
I mean,
the guy can do anything--

14:07.237 --> 14:09.718
sleight of hand, close magic.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.938
I mean, he even hypnotized me
to help me quit smoking.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.026
Psch!

14:15.463 --> 14:16.943
You guys do know
I'm not the only one

14:16.943 --> 14:18.596
with a record here, right?

14:18.596 --> 14:21.164
Is there some specific employee
you were thinking of?

14:21.164 --> 14:22.949
No, not employee.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.211
I'm talking residents.

14:30.391 --> 14:33.133
Alison didn't have too much
of an online footprint.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.830
Too busy to curate her life.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.311
Yeah, well, I interviewed
the rest of her housemates.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.226
Turns out,
she did have a boyfriend.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.837
A guy named Jason Howell,
and listen to this.

14:41.837 --> 14:44.013
He's a research assistant
for a new drug trial

14:44.013 --> 14:46.189
for a high blood pressure med.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.800
- This guy?
- Yeah, that's him.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.151
They broke up a few months ago.
He took it hard.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.196
So far, no photos of Milo.

14:53.196 --> 14:54.894
Yeah, he's still a mystery,

14:54.894 --> 14:57.853
but maybe that's why he was
creeping in Alison's window.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.811
They had a little
sneaky-link thing going on.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.945
So Jason gets Alison
into the drug trial.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.599
She needs the money, plus he
gets to see her all the time.

15:04.599 --> 15:07.036
Yeah, he probably thought
she'd be grateful,

15:07.036 --> 15:08.733
want to get back together.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.997
Why do boys always want
to fix things?

15:10.997 --> 15:13.260
Well, look at this.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.479
That's a hoist, right? For deer?

15:15.479 --> 15:18.178
We're looking for a hunter.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.049
Jason might be our guy.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.493
Jason just went
to get some fresh air.

15:29.493 --> 15:31.931
He's been really upset.
But he should be back soon.

15:33.454 --> 15:36.326
- What's your name?
- Darla. Wall.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.763
I'm Dr. Tilda's
other research assistant.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.722
Can you tell us a little
about this research?

15:40.722 --> 15:43.638
It's a Phase One trial for
a new hypertension medication.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.770
We're simply observing
side effects,

15:45.770 --> 15:48.034
making sure the drugs are fit
for human consumption.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.383
Hi, Jason.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.341
Oh. Jason?

15:51.341 --> 15:54.301
Um, these people
are here to talk to you.

15:56.346 --> 15:57.739
I'll leave you.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.572
That was the weekend
I took Alison

16:04.572 --> 16:07.357
to my family's cabin
to meet everyone.

16:07.357 --> 16:11.448
Parents, grandparents, cousins.
They were all there.

16:11.448 --> 16:15.017
That's like a, what,
300-, 400-pound hoist?

16:15.017 --> 16:16.845
You hunt with rifles, bows?

16:16.845 --> 16:18.760
I don't hunt at all.
It's more my brothers.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.110
Alison hated the hunting.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.155
Where were you last night?

16:22.155 --> 16:25.027
Here, at the lab.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.942
Darla and I were
compiling research.

16:26.942 --> 16:27.682
All night long?

16:29.249 --> 16:30.728
We're on a deadline.

16:30.728 --> 16:33.688
Our advisor, Dr. Tilda--
she-- she doesn't like excuses.

16:33.688 --> 16:36.604
Alison was a part of
this drug trial, right?

16:36.604 --> 16:38.606
Mm-hmm.

16:38.606 --> 16:41.870
- Because of you.
- She needed money.

16:41.870 --> 16:45.134
She was always working so hard,
but it was never enough.

16:45.134 --> 16:46.657
I was afraid she was
gonna drop out of school.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.095
This seemed... easy.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.748
Did the drugs affect her?
Any side effects?

16:50.748 --> 16:52.663
She never mentioned any.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.013
Why did you and Alison break up?

16:55.275 --> 16:56.711
I don't know.

16:56.711 --> 17:01.063
She got all weird
and shut-down and serious.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.239
She had this...
outsider mentality,

17:03.239 --> 17:04.806
like she didn't deserve
to be loved.

17:07.069 --> 17:07.983
Maybe she just
wasn't that into you.

17:10.507 --> 17:13.336
"Maybe she wasn't
that into you"?

17:13.336 --> 17:15.904
- The kid was in mourning.
- Or he's the killer.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.514
"She felt like she didn't
deserve to be loved"?

17:17.514 --> 17:19.125
What is he-- some kind
of psychological genius?

17:19.125 --> 17:20.996
It feels like
you're over-identifying.

17:20.996 --> 17:24.521
Actually, I'm applying
my lived experience to the case.

17:24.521 --> 17:25.783
What's up with this one?

17:26.436 --> 17:27.698
Hi.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.961
- Are you okay?
- Oh. Yeah.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.790
I was just trying to stay awake,
keep the blood moving.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.357
You know, sitting
is the new smoking.

17:34.357 --> 17:35.924
Right. Right.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.665
Jason mentioned you two were
working together all night.

17:39.928 --> 17:40.929
W--

17:43.149 --> 17:44.802
That's a very long,
dramatic pause, Darla.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.456
No, I-- No.

17:46.456 --> 17:49.242
Um, the important thing
is that--

17:49.242 --> 17:51.244
Jason is, like,
the sweetest guy I know.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.115
I've-- I've known him
for years,

17:53.115 --> 17:55.291
and I know that
he really loves Alison,

17:55.291 --> 17:57.989
and there's nothing
he would ever do to hurt her.

17:57.989 --> 18:00.731
Right. We get it. Great guy.
What are you trying to say?

18:02.168 --> 18:06.259
Um, I wasn't with him,
like, all night.

18:06.259 --> 18:10.089
I went to the gym and
worked out and took a shower,

18:10.089 --> 18:13.135
and then at some point,
I think around, like, midnight,

18:13.135 --> 18:16.660
I took a nap on the couch
in Dr. Tilda's office.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.532
But, please, don't tell her
I did that, okay?

18:18.532 --> 18:20.273
She really does not like me
on her couch.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.845
Thank you, Gus.
Very nice ceramics.

18:27.845 --> 18:29.195
How many more rooms are there?

18:29.195 --> 18:30.718
That was just the first wing.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.982
Seriously?

18:33.982 --> 18:35.157
- What's that noise?
- What's going on?

18:35.157 --> 18:36.637
You go help Mr. Casey.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.160
What's happening?
Is there a fire?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.901
I'm sure
it's just a false alarm,

18:39.901 --> 18:41.642
but we do need everyone outside
and accounted for just in case.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.035
- Yeah.
- Think someone pulled it?

18:44.035 --> 18:45.515
Heard we were searching rooms?

18:45.515 --> 18:48.562
Absolutely. These old people
are cagier than they look.

18:48.562 --> 18:49.780
Oh. This way, please. I'm sorry.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.913
The Fire Department
will clear it shortly.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.828
No. You know what?
Grab a resident list
and meet us outside.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.351
We're gonna go on a field trip.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.353
Yep, just follow me.
We're gonna get there.

18:57.353 --> 18:58.789
Good. Good job.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.445
It's the hospital.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.360
This is Agent Mitchell.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.015
<i>Faith, it's Farhad. I
have an update on Milo Braham.</i>

19:07.015 --> 19:08.408
<i>I'm afraid it's not good.</i>

19:08.408 --> 19:11.193
His seizure's the result
of a drug interaction.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.108
He'll have to be kept
in a medically induced coma

19:13.108 --> 19:14.675
a few days more.

19:14.675 --> 19:17.286
Was one of the drugs in his
system an anti-hypertensive?

19:17.286 --> 19:20.071
Actually, yes. How'd you know?

19:20.071 --> 19:21.682
Our victim was a part
of a drug trial.

19:21.682 --> 19:23.118
Maybe Milo was, too.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.946
That could explain it,

19:24.946 --> 19:27.209
but Milo had numerous
pre-existing conditions.

19:27.209 --> 19:30.038
He should never have been
allowed in a drug trial.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.519
You know,
my shift's ending soon.

19:32.519 --> 19:35.435
I was gonna grab a bite to eat,
if you're available.

19:35.435 --> 19:38.220
You're on speaker with
my colleague, Agent Trent.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.265
She's wide open.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.570
Oh.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.790
I am not "wide open."
What do you mean by that?

19:42.790 --> 19:45.706
It-- Okay.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.447
Thank you for the update,
Dr. Pournazeri.

19:47.447 --> 19:51.015
Farhad. Right. Yes.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.104
Farhad.
I'll be in touch. Goodbye.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.717
You shut your mouth.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.893
You know what they say-- if you
don't use it, you lose it.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.503
All right?
This could be a good thing.

20:00.503 --> 20:01.722
You know, he's a doctor,
he's handsome--

20:01.722 --> 20:03.637
Can we get back to the case?

20:03.637 --> 20:05.465
- Yes.
- Thank you.

20:05.465 --> 20:08.816
Milo's parents are wealthy.
He didn't need the money.

20:08.816 --> 20:11.427
No reason to join a drug trial,

20:11.427 --> 20:13.255
especially if it's risky
for him.

20:13.255 --> 20:17.259
So why go out of his way
to take blood pressure meds?

20:18.217 --> 20:21.220
Maybe this whole thing
is about side effects--

20:21.220 --> 20:22.482
not the bad ones, but good ones.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.398
You know,
think Viagra, Rogaine--

20:25.398 --> 20:27.269
drugs that were developed
for one thing

20:27.269 --> 20:30.054
and now are being sold
for something else entirely.

20:30.054 --> 20:31.578
We need to talk
to other participants,

20:31.578 --> 20:33.275
find out what those drugs do.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.669
Well, I know how to get college
students to talk, so come on.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.682
Do we get pizza?!

20:52.163 --> 20:53.643
Come on!

20:55.471 --> 20:59.867
I'll tell you whose room
you should search-- Milly's.

20:59.867 --> 21:03.218
I've seen Steve the Magician
going to visit her.

21:03.218 --> 21:04.567
Were you jealous?

21:04.567 --> 21:06.352
No.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.136
Come on.
Pretty young lady like you?

21:09.746 --> 21:11.313
Do you think Linda was jealous?

21:11.313 --> 21:13.794
Of course Linda was jealous.

21:13.794 --> 21:17.058
Always had her cloudy eyes
on him,

21:17.058 --> 21:19.190
and he rejected her.

21:19.190 --> 21:22.368
He did not reject me.

21:22.368 --> 21:25.588
He simply valued our friendship
too much to tarnish it.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.982
Are you saying these
relationships were physical?

21:27.982 --> 21:29.940
Oh, God, no.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.682
H-He'd just flirt with them,
make them happy.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.728
And what about you?
Did you do it?

21:34.728 --> 21:36.338
What? No.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.427
You could have.
I see those muscles.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.429
I could-- W--

21:40.429 --> 21:42.953
Well, I have been using
the resistance bands.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.003
Mmm.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.529
You know they got pizza
upstairs, right?

21:55.618 --> 21:58.360
Here's the thing. It helps
you study, get stuff done.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.492
Like Adderall times ten.

21:59.492 --> 22:00.623
You sure it's safe?

22:00.623 --> 22:01.711
Oh, I have no idea.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.932
I am a laser.

22:04.932 --> 22:06.586
Laser-focused. See my eyes?

22:08.022 --> 22:08.762
Lasers.

22:09.589 --> 22:11.155
Helps me with my memory.

22:11.155 --> 22:12.896
Lets me study all night,
no crash.

22:12.896 --> 22:15.595
Have you heard anybody
selling the pills?

22:15.595 --> 22:17.292
Impossible. Every time
you pick up your pills,

22:17.292 --> 22:19.468
you have to give a blood sample,
prove you've been taking them.

22:19.468 --> 22:20.991
Are you on it right now?

22:20.991 --> 22:23.385
Pssh. There's totally
a black market.

22:23.385 --> 22:26.606
One time, I took double the
dose, just as an experiment.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.608
It did not go well.

22:28.608 --> 22:29.652
Do you know Milo Braham?

22:29.652 --> 22:32.220
Milo? Oh, yeah. Sure.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.657
Yeah, he was
definitely buying, yeah.

22:34.657 --> 22:38.400
Used them to stay up all night,
make art or whatever.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.619
Kind of a waste.

22:42.012 --> 22:44.580
The girl who died?
I heard rumors she was selling.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.760
Really?
You know what it's like

22:50.760 --> 22:52.371
to go and visit
your elderly father

22:52.371 --> 22:53.981
and find out the place is empty?

22:53.981 --> 22:55.678
And a firefighter
is there telling you

22:55.678 --> 22:57.201
that everybody's
at the police station

22:57.201 --> 22:58.333
because there's been a murder?!

22:58.333 --> 22:59.769
I'm so sorry.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.336
Ma'am, I-I really can imagine
that must have been

23:01.336 --> 23:03.033
very upsetting,
but Ms. Hernandez

23:03.033 --> 23:04.383
was just following
our orders, so--

23:04.383 --> 23:05.819
Doesn't even matter,

23:05.819 --> 23:07.908
because I was coming
to take him out anyway.

23:07.908 --> 23:09.344
Dad! Come on!

23:09.344 --> 23:11.694
- Where is the pizza?!
- Come on, Dad.

23:11.694 --> 23:15.176
And I specifically asked you to
help him control his spending,

23:15.176 --> 23:17.918
and you didn't do that, so we're
finding a new place for him.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.833
I'm sorry. What were you saying
about his spending?

23:19.833 --> 23:21.965
He goes online
and charges a fortune.

23:21.965 --> 23:25.142
I cancel the card,
and he just orders another one.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.231
They told me they would
put passwords on his computer

23:27.231 --> 23:31.105
to stop him,
but obviously, they lied.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.108
Gus, it's so easy
to get sucked in.

23:34.108 --> 23:36.545
I-I get it, man. Is it--
For me, it's jewelry.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.460
Is it-- Is it
art supplies for you?

23:38.460 --> 23:40.201
I don't even use the Internet.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.515
Said she was gonna call you.

23:49.515 --> 23:52.126
She's gonna be there. You
know we got to study, though.

23:54.563 --> 23:57.827
Hey. Should I ask?

23:57.827 --> 23:59.002
Should I?

24:00.134 --> 24:01.309
- Probably not.
- Hm.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.050
Uh, hey, can you
hook me up with someone

24:03.050 --> 24:04.573
in the GBI's financial crimes
division?

24:04.573 --> 24:07.097
Sure. Um, Eric Peterson.
He's the best.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.751
Great. Thanks.

24:14.757 --> 24:15.802
Tell me.

24:18.761 --> 24:22.330
The case I'm working.
The dead girl.

24:22.330 --> 24:25.376
She's one of us, Ange.
She had no one.

24:25.376 --> 24:28.118
Put herself in harm's way
just trying to support herself,

24:28.118 --> 24:29.729
make it through college.

24:29.729 --> 24:30.686
Shouldn't have happened.

24:32.949 --> 24:36.562
No, it shouldn't have,
but she's got you now.

24:39.739 --> 24:40.783
Eric Peterson.

24:40.783 --> 24:41.784
Yeah.

24:53.404 --> 24:55.885
Selling drugs puts you at risk.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.628
You could have been killed
for the drugs, Alison.

25:01.761 --> 25:04.154
You're disappointed in me.

25:04.154 --> 25:05.504
No.

25:07.114 --> 25:10.291
Good people make bad choices.

25:10.291 --> 25:12.772
And I understand
what you were up against.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.516
You know what they give you

25:17.516 --> 25:19.779
when they kick you out
of the home at 18, right?

25:21.302 --> 25:24.566
$200 and a bus pass. I know.

25:26.307 --> 25:30.006
I was so hungry, I shoplifted
for food when I was 19.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.530
Got caught, too.

25:32.879 --> 25:35.316
I was lucky.

25:35.316 --> 25:38.580
The captain of
the police precinct--

25:38.580 --> 25:40.234
her name's Amanda Wagner--

25:40.234 --> 25:44.020
and for reasons
I'll never understand...

25:44.020 --> 25:45.718
she took an interest in me.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.550
You were so close, Alison.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.555
You just needed one more thing
to break your way.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.777
So, no.

26:03.170 --> 26:04.432
No judgment.

26:07.653 --> 26:08.697
None at all.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.965
I'm gonna find who did this
to you, Alison.

26:18.141 --> 26:19.229
I promise.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.941
If Alison was selling,
someone inside the study

26:34.941 --> 26:36.899
had to be helping her
get the extra pills.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.988
Yeah, it must have been her ex,
right? Jason Howell?

26:38.988 --> 26:41.121
That's what I thought,
then I talked to Chancellor Kuo

26:41.121 --> 26:42.688
this morning,
and she says that the rules

26:42.688 --> 26:45.125
for drug trials on campus
are crystal clear,

26:45.125 --> 26:47.127
specifically to prevent
this sort of thing.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.608
No pills without a blood test
proving that the subject's

26:49.608 --> 26:51.348
actually taking them.

26:51.348 --> 26:53.699
Okay. Well, who signs off
on the blood test?

26:53.699 --> 26:56.440
The head researcher.
In this case, it's Dr. Tilda.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.486
Any way she could get
extra pills?

26:58.486 --> 27:00.357
Maybe.

27:00.357 --> 27:02.229
And she could falsify data,

27:02.229 --> 27:03.622
claim there are more participants

27:03.622 --> 27:05.145
than there really are,

27:05.145 --> 27:07.364
pass on the extra pills
for Alison to sell.

27:07.364 --> 27:11.630
That note Alison wrote--
"I want it to end."

27:11.630 --> 27:13.806
You think she was talking about
her arrangement with Dr. Tilda?

27:15.634 --> 27:16.896
Let's go find out.

27:18.549 --> 27:20.987
You think I would jeopardize
my reputation,

27:20.987 --> 27:24.207
my entire academic career,
for a few extra dollars?

27:24.207 --> 27:26.645
Maybe it was a lot
of extra dollars.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.385
You're going through
a nasty divorce, right?

27:28.385 --> 27:30.474
Every penny counts.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.172
Oh, and a non-tenure
faculty position

27:32.172 --> 27:34.000
isn't exactly
a lottery ticket.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.349
Probably why
you were shifting over

27:35.349 --> 27:37.133
to pharmaceutical research
in the first place.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.658
I would never
falsify research.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.660
How many participants
do you claim are in the trial?

27:41.660 --> 27:44.706
I can't discuss any of
the details of my work

27:44.706 --> 27:45.968
without a warrant.

27:45.968 --> 27:48.188
Oh.

27:50.146 --> 27:51.452
Good thing we have one.

27:54.324 --> 27:57.110
Should we, uh, take a walk
over to your lab?

28:02.158 --> 28:04.117
What'd the GBI guy say?

28:04.117 --> 28:06.336
Alright. Dead magician guy,
Steve Susperio--

28:06.336 --> 28:08.817
real name,
Steven Gary Carmichael.

28:08.817 --> 28:10.427
He was already
under investigation

28:10.427 --> 28:12.342
by the GBI
for identify theft.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.735
He's been
siphoning away money

28:13.735 --> 28:15.824
from elderly residents
all over the state.

28:15.824 --> 28:18.174
How?

28:18.174 --> 28:20.307
No. Really?

28:20.307 --> 28:21.830
Hypnotizing them?

28:21.830 --> 28:24.398
Social Security numbers, passwords,

28:24.398 --> 28:25.704
anything he could get.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.097
Wow.
What a scumbag.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.838
Yeah.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.840
So you think a bunch of
the residents figured it out

28:31.840 --> 28:33.015
and ganged up on him?

28:33.015 --> 28:34.277
Now they're keeping
a code of silence?

28:34.277 --> 28:36.279
I think that's
a little elaborate,

28:36.279 --> 28:37.846
considering the crowd
we just met.

28:42.764 --> 28:45.245
Ormewood. Yeah?

28:48.335 --> 28:49.989
Okay. Thank you.

28:51.338 --> 28:52.643
Well, they finished
the search.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.254
Someone conveniently
poured water

28:54.254 --> 28:55.690
all over their computers
on their way out.

28:55.690 --> 28:58.475
- That was the fire drill.
- Yeah.

28:58.475 --> 29:01.000
- Remember Sheila?
- Yeah.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.610
Well, it turns out a rabbit

29:02.610 --> 29:04.525
wasn't the only thing
she took from Steve.

29:04.525 --> 29:05.613
Did she take his phone?

29:05.613 --> 29:06.832
They're bringing it in
right now.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.010
Jackpot!

29:11.010 --> 29:14.187
Just so you know,
I'm calling my attorney.

29:14.187 --> 29:15.928
Well, that's gonna be
very expensive for you,

29:15.928 --> 29:17.190
- and it's not gonna help.
- Will, the door!

29:19.018 --> 29:21.585
Ohh! Oh, my God. No.
No, no, no, no. No! Oh!

29:27.896 --> 29:29.593
Oh, my God.

29:29.593 --> 29:31.682
Ohh!

29:38.254 --> 29:40.256
I'll get the paramedics.

29:40.256 --> 29:41.344
It's Darla.

29:41.344 --> 29:44.086
You're okay.
Just stay with us, Darla.

29:44.086 --> 29:45.522
You're gonna be okay.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.834
<i>Hello. My name
is Steve Susperio.</i>

29:52.834 --> 29:54.836
<i>I'm a magician,
and this is my audition tape</i>

29:54.836 --> 29:57.839
<i>for America's Next
Great Entertainer.</i>

29:57.839 --> 29:59.493
- No way.
- Yeah.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.451
This is the last time
he uses the phone.

30:01.451 --> 30:03.497
I think it's all
you're gonna need.

30:03.497 --> 30:06.239
<i>...the joy I bring to seniors,
a childlike wonder--</i>

30:06.239 --> 30:09.416
<i>The Bahamas?! When
were you gonna tell me?</i>

30:09.416 --> 30:10.634
<i>What? Nancy? I-I-I--</i>

30:13.507 --> 30:15.639
<i>No, I'm not trying to leave
you. That's not true!</i>

30:15.639 --> 30:17.772
<i>You're lying!
You are greedy!</i>

30:17.772 --> 30:18.991
So we got everything
on camera?

30:18.991 --> 30:20.079
- Yep.
<i>- That's the truth!</i>

30:20.079 --> 30:22.081
They argue,
things get out of hand...

30:23.473 --> 30:25.171
<i>This is no money.</i>

30:26.694 --> 30:28.304
<i>Oh, great.
Yeah, that's just great.</i>

30:28.304 --> 30:30.263
<i>What are you gonna do?
Stab me now?</i>

30:30.263 --> 30:32.656
<i>I've got a show to do,
you crazy loon!</i>

30:32.656 --> 30:34.397
<i>Don't call me crazy!</i>

30:34.397 --> 30:35.224
<i>Aah!</i>

30:35.224 --> 30:37.096
Ohh!
Wow!

30:37.096 --> 30:38.749
Well, you know, I gotta say,
I ruled her out

30:38.749 --> 30:39.881
- because, I mean--
- Tiny.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.840
- Look. She's tiny.
- Yeah.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.146
Nancy wipes things off and
gets the hell out of there.

30:44.146 --> 30:46.496
Never even notices the phone
across the room.

30:46.496 --> 30:48.542
The phone just keeps
recording until...

30:51.719 --> 30:53.416
Hey, look. There's Sheila.

30:57.464 --> 31:01.337
Sheila. Wow.

31:01.337 --> 31:04.253
Well, I gotta give it to him.
That was pretty entertaining.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.038
We're terrible people.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.561
Yeah.

31:09.215 --> 31:11.565
Do you remember
what happened?

31:11.565 --> 31:13.654
I went
into the lab early.

31:13.654 --> 31:16.918
Uh, Jason was--

31:16.918 --> 31:19.094
was getting really behind
on his reports,

31:19.094 --> 31:20.879
which was
totally understandable,

31:20.879 --> 31:23.925
so I thought I'd catch up
his work for him.

31:23.925 --> 31:27.320
And as I did,
I-I noticed something strange.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.277
Strange like what?

31:30.932 --> 31:34.370
The bloodwork for
multiple participants--

31:34.370 --> 31:35.371
it was identical.

31:37.156 --> 31:41.290
It was as if one person was
giving multiple blood samples,

31:41.290 --> 31:44.685
a-a-and Jason was just entering
them under different names.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.644
Was one of those names
Alison Schooner?

31:49.820 --> 31:52.693
Yes.

31:52.693 --> 31:56.131
I couldn't understand it,
so I went to the records room

31:56.131 --> 32:00.875
to see if anything like that
had happened before.

32:00.875 --> 32:03.399
I was standing there,
looking through the logs,

32:03.399 --> 32:06.315
and-- and then I heard
someone come in behind me.

32:10.406 --> 32:13.627
I don't understand it.

32:13.627 --> 32:16.151
I can't believe
he would hurt me.

32:16.151 --> 32:17.979
It was Jason?

32:17.979 --> 32:20.416
Mm.

32:25.813 --> 32:27.815
Jason Howell wasn't
in his apartment.

32:27.815 --> 32:30.165
- And his car's still outside?
- Bicycle, too.

32:30.165 --> 32:32.472
We've canvassed the area,
but no one's seen him.

32:32.472 --> 32:34.430
He's got to be hiding
somewhere here.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.389
Laundry room, mailroom.

32:36.389 --> 32:37.564
Does this building
have a basement?

32:37.564 --> 32:39.000
Yeah. This way.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.879
Check the stairwell.
And be careful. He's dangerous.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.534
Of course, Vera. I know.

33:34.534 --> 33:37.972
Not exactly the low-profile
investigation you had hoped for.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.843
Hang in there.
We'll get a drink soon.

33:39.843 --> 33:42.150
Chancellor Kuo?

33:42.150 --> 33:44.326
She's giving Dr. Tilda
a leave of absence with pay.

33:44.326 --> 33:46.459
Believes she didn't know
what Jason was up to,

33:46.459 --> 33:48.069
but she's
still responsible

33:48.069 --> 33:49.157
for the study
getting out of control.

33:51.116 --> 33:53.466
- What?
- Something's not right.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.294
Okay, so talk to me.

33:55.294 --> 33:56.904
But I need evidence,
not just your gut.

33:56.904 --> 33:59.341
Here's a question.
Jason was strong.

33:59.341 --> 34:00.821
That's not a question.

34:00.821 --> 34:02.301
If he was trying
to make Alison's death

34:02.301 --> 34:04.433
look like suicide, why not
just hold her underwater?

34:04.433 --> 34:07.567
Why stab her and risk getting
caught? It's a dumb move.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.569
It could be
an emotional reason.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.527
He loved her.
He wanted it to be quick.

34:11.527 --> 34:13.007
He didn't want
to feel her struggle.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.574
Or he didn't kill her
at all.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.882
Maybe the killer wanted us to
figure out it wasn't suicide.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.580
Because they wanted us
to think it was Jason.

34:23.104 --> 34:26.760
Our killer wasn't dumb.
They're smart. Very smart.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.805
Hmm.

34:28.805 --> 34:30.155
Guess you
better be smarter.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.417
I guess so.

34:38.163 --> 34:41.296
I know it's upsetting.

34:41.296 --> 34:44.343
Jason was a very disturbed
young man.

34:44.343 --> 34:46.345
But it's all over now.

34:46.345 --> 34:49.609
All right? You can focus on
healing, go on with your life.

34:49.609 --> 34:51.350
Thank you.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.961
Excuse me, agents.
Can I speak to one of you?

35:00.272 --> 35:02.143
I'll never stop
thinking about them.

35:02.143 --> 35:05.233
For the rest of my life.

35:05.233 --> 35:08.018
My entire career.

35:08.018 --> 35:09.498
I'm going to dedicate it
to Alison.

35:11.239 --> 35:13.850
I'm sure that would
mean something to her,

35:13.850 --> 35:15.069
being remembered.

35:15.069 --> 35:16.462
Yeah.

35:20.422 --> 35:21.815
Will?

35:25.862 --> 35:27.125
You take care of yourself, Darla.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.088
Milo Braham just
regained consciousness.

35:34.088 --> 35:36.656
That's great. No need to
rush to get his statement

35:36.656 --> 35:38.223
now that we know
he was just a buyer.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.007
Yeah, except
he just admitted

35:40.007 --> 35:42.096
he was following Alison
the night she died.

35:42.096 --> 35:43.445
He said he saw her
being attacked.

35:43.445 --> 35:44.794
He wants to talk to us.

35:44.794 --> 35:47.057
Alright. So let's go.
What room is he in now?

35:47.057 --> 35:50.409
237, but please wait
at least a few hours.

35:50.409 --> 35:52.193
Milo's sleeping.
It's imperative he rest.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.629
He's still quite weak.

35:53.629 --> 35:56.023
Great. We'll come back
first thing in the morning.

35:56.023 --> 35:57.546
Fine.
Thank you, Doctor.

36:27.924 --> 36:31.711
Milo's not here.
He's still in a coma.

36:32.712 --> 36:34.540
Oh. I...

36:34.540 --> 36:38.021
It was the boiler room.
That's what tipped me off.

36:38.021 --> 36:39.893
It was smart.

37:04.265 --> 37:07.225
You were trying
to keep the body warm,

37:07.225 --> 37:08.704
obscure time of death.

37:14.536 --> 37:17.191
You needed us to believe
that you were stabbed first

37:17.191 --> 37:20.150
then Jason died,
not the other way around.

37:22.152 --> 37:23.850
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:23.850 --> 37:27.332
We found the scalpel, the one
that you used to stab yourself.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.001
Didn't make sense.

37:45.001 --> 37:49.049
Why would someone stab Alison
with such deadly precision

37:49.049 --> 37:51.791
then stab you precisely
where you wouldn't die?

37:54.228 --> 37:58.232
No, this is, uh--
this is a mistake.

37:58.232 --> 38:00.800
You were the one
taking advantage of Alison.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.324
You were supplying the pills,
and she was selling them,

38:03.324 --> 38:05.674
and when she wanted to stop,
you killed her.

38:07.850 --> 38:09.983
Tried to frame Jason.

38:09.983 --> 38:11.245
Right?

38:18.774 --> 38:21.690
Oh, no. I--

38:21.690 --> 38:23.866
No, I was--
I was helping her!

38:23.866 --> 38:25.433
I gave her half the money,

38:25.433 --> 38:28.828
and she was going to tell on me,
ruin everything!

38:28.828 --> 38:30.656
It's not fair!

38:30.656 --> 38:34.268
No.
Nothing ever is.

38:34.268 --> 38:36.052
Darla Wall, you are
under arrest for the murders

38:36.052 --> 38:38.359
of Alison Schooner
and Jason Howell.

38:43.625 --> 38:46.324
Ms. Hernandez was not
just dating the magician.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.890
She was his accomplice.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.457
And she wasn't the only one.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.198
The guy'd been grifting his way
across the Sun Belt,

38:51.198 --> 38:52.852
cozying up
to lonely administrators

38:52.852 --> 38:55.811
at every senior home
that booked him.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.900
We turned over her computer
to the GBI.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.598
And we started
a betting pool

38:59.598 --> 39:01.861
on how much Susperio grifted off
the boomers over the years.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.732
It's a lot. I got 85K.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.952
That's too low.
You want in?

39:08.607 --> 39:11.740
I just never want to hear
about this again.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.307
Good job, you two.

39:18.878 --> 39:21.141
Poof.

39:21.141 --> 39:23.361
Terrible people.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.281
Good work, partner.

39:31.281 --> 39:32.500
Are you gonna be okay?

39:32.500 --> 39:34.372
Yeah.
Sure I will.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.895
How about you?

39:35.895 --> 39:39.594
You, uh, gonna see how things
go with Dr. Far-hottie?

39:39.594 --> 39:43.337
Whoa. Boundaries. Okay, uh,
never say that again.

39:44.860 --> 39:47.123
I can't believe I was trying
to have a moment with you.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.561
- Unh-unh.
- Oh.

39:49.561 --> 39:51.214
This is serious.

39:51.214 --> 39:52.259
Mm.

39:55.305 --> 39:58.004
Alright.
Last, but not least.

39:59.919 --> 40:01.660
What's on the potatoes?
It's delicious.

40:01.660 --> 40:04.314
Oh. If I told you all
my cooking secrets,

40:04.314 --> 40:05.490
you wouldn't need me
anymore, huh?

40:05.490 --> 40:07.666
Whoa!
Little spicy.

40:07.666 --> 40:08.928
That's the harissa,

40:08.928 --> 40:11.496
and, uh, it's got
a little kick of cayenne.

40:11.496 --> 40:13.628
It'll sneak up on you.
Betty can't have any of this.

40:13.628 --> 40:15.325
Here. Come on.

40:15.325 --> 40:16.805
She doesn't handle spice
very well, do you, girl?

40:16.805 --> 40:18.198
But you got plenty of spice,
don't you?

40:18.198 --> 40:20.896
Yes, you do.
Okay. Alright.

40:20.896 --> 40:22.681
Hey, I-I want
to say something.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.683
Um, Will closed a case today,
a murder,

40:24.683 --> 40:27.773
and I think we should
honor the victim.

40:27.773 --> 40:30.384
Seriously?
During dinner?

40:30.384 --> 40:31.472
Well, yeah.

40:31.472 --> 40:34.780
Uh... I'll start.

40:34.780 --> 40:38.174
I didn't know Alison Schooner,
but she existed.

40:38.174 --> 40:41.917
She got herself out
of the system, into college.

40:41.917 --> 40:43.876
That means she was tough.

40:46.095 --> 40:48.837
I, uh, would have liked
to have known her.

40:48.837 --> 40:50.883
I'm sad that I won't.

40:53.102 --> 40:54.495
How old was she?

40:54.495 --> 40:55.583
19.

40:57.324 --> 40:58.978
Man, that sucks.

40:58.978 --> 41:01.284
Yeah.

41:01.284 --> 41:02.590
Here's what I know
about Alison.

41:02.590 --> 41:05.941
Um, she was an oxy orphan,
and she bounced

41:05.941 --> 41:07.508
through five foster homes and--

41:07.508 --> 41:10.468
Oh, my God. I am not inviting
you to my funeral.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.252
It's not a case report.

41:13.949 --> 41:16.996
She felt alone.

41:16.996 --> 41:21.391
She didn't have anyone,
and, uh, she was trying.

41:21.391 --> 41:25.787
She was learning, you know,
starting to let people in.

41:25.787 --> 41:27.093
You know how hard that is.

41:28.834 --> 41:32.185
And I'd like to think
that eventually, um,

41:32.185 --> 41:34.796
if things
had been different,

41:34.796 --> 41:38.147
she'd be sitting in a room
just like this.

41:41.890 --> 41:44.980
So, to Alison.

41:44.980 --> 41:49.202
You were seen, you were known,
you'll be remembered.

41:49.202 --> 41:51.204

41:51.204 --> 41:54.163

Okay,
food's getting cold.

41:55.948 --> 41:57.993
I'm gonna get offended.
Let's go. Come on.

41:57.993 --> 41:59.908
Not sure if I can eat
any more.

41:59.908 --> 42:02.476
You just can't take the heat
of the harissa.

42:02.476 --> 42:05.610
Give me your potatoes.
Thank you.
