[narrator]  Previously on  Riverdale:

00:09.718 --> 00:13.221
[Black Hood]  This is the Black Hood.
I want to cleanse Riverdale of sinners.

00:13.304 --> 00:14.973
I can't keep doing this.

00:15.056 --> 00:19.811
I need you to cut your friends
out of your life, or I will, my way.

00:19.894 --> 00:23.523
I'll consider reopening
The   Red and the Black  on two conditions:

00:23.606 --> 00:28.319
One, no gangs. Two, no jingle-jangle.
See you trafficking in either, we're done.

00:28.403 --> 00:32.240
Hang with the Serpents.
Ghoulies get a whiff that you're alone...

00:32.323 --> 00:33.950
[Jughead grunting]

00:34.075 --> 00:37.912
Tall Boy gave me this jacket.
It's time I start wearing it.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.332
-Is that--?
-Jingle-jangle.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.086
Nick, I mean it. Stop!

00:45.170 --> 00:47.797
We didn't get a chance to talk last night.

00:49.424 --> 00:53.094
I want Nick to pay, to suffer,
to burn in hell.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.722
-[Black Hood]  Give me another name.
-Nick St. Clair.

00:57.766 --> 01:02.062
[Jughead]  In Riverdale, everyone
wears a mask, not just the Black Hood.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.399
But every so often the mask slips

01:06.483 --> 01:10.070
and our true selves are laid bare
for all the world to see.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.030
Morning.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.907
You, uh...?

01:13.990 --> 01:15.033
You hungry?

01:15.700 --> 01:17.702
You never have to ask me that.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.370
Cool.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.294
[Jughead]  So, we scramble
to put it back on,

01:26.377 --> 01:29.798
like a kid in a cheap Halloween costume,
but it's too late.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.509
People have already seen
what's underneath...

01:34.469 --> 01:35.720
and it's terrifying.

01:41.017 --> 01:41.893
Oh, my God.

01:53.029 --> 01:55.782
What? Here to finish
what your little friend started?

01:56.324 --> 01:57.408
You're alive.

01:58.827 --> 02:02.789
Yeah. Tell that bitch Veronica
she's lucky I'm not pressing charges.

02:02.872 --> 02:05.250
[Mr. St. Clair] Nicholas,
why aren't you dressed yet?

02:05.333 --> 02:06.543
And who's this?

02:07.460 --> 02:09.712
You're not safe here, okay? Any of you.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.548
You need to go--

02:12.257 --> 02:15.343
-Nicholas St. Clair?
-He is, and I'm his father.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.805
-Is there a problem?
-[Keller] There's a complaint against him.

02:18.888 --> 02:22.517
He'll have to come to the station.
You and your wife, as well.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.561
You might wanna get dressed, son.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.151
Should I ask what you're doing here?

02:31.985 --> 02:36.531
I'm... making sure
Nick got what was coming to him.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.533
Go home, Betty.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.622
[cell phone rings]

02:50.545 --> 02:51.796
You didn't kill him.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.424
[Black Hood]
Nick isn't one of Riverdale's sons.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.343
You've already given me
the most wonderful gift.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.012
You said Nick's name.

02:59.095 --> 03:02.724
In that moment of nakedness,
you let me see the real Betty Cooper.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.226
And she was beautiful and righteous.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.854
Judge, jury, executioner...

03:07.937 --> 03:11.190
No. No, that's not-- I'm-- That's--

03:11.274 --> 03:16.070
Now that I've seen your true self, Betty,
the real work can begin.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.405
What do you mean--?

03:17.488 --> 03:18.781
[line beeps]

03:24.037 --> 03:24.871
[cell phone chimes]

03:31.586 --> 03:33.421
[Hermione] Penelope, thank you for coming.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.549
We called as soon as Cheryl told us.

03:37.508 --> 03:38.718
I appreciate that.

03:40.136 --> 03:43.348
I just wish you'd stopped her
from talking to Sheriff Keller.

03:43.431 --> 03:47.560
Lord knows what Cheryl did or said
to the St. Clair boy to provoke him.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.854
According to Veronica, nothing.

03:49.938 --> 03:54.609
Hermione, Hiram,
I want this handled discreetly.

03:57.403 --> 04:00.531
Well, I'm confident
that the St. Clairs feel the same way.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.075
[Penelope] Then it's settled.

04:02.158 --> 04:06.454
I'll talk to that idiot Keller
and tell him we won't be pressing charges.

04:07.080 --> 04:07.997
After all...

04:09.540 --> 04:11.542
nothing really happened to Cheryl.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.925
Cheryl, I'm... so sorry.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.844
Don't be silly. I'm used to it.

04:21.928 --> 04:26.057
And besides, you heard what Mommy said.
Nothing really happened to me.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.434
-Nick roofied you. He--
-I'm fine.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.270
Veronica, everything's fine.

04:30.853 --> 04:31.854
If everything is fine,

04:31.938 --> 04:34.565
why did we just call Sheriff Keller
and make a statement?

04:34.649 --> 04:37.819
Momentary lapse in sanity.
I mean, can you even imagine?

04:37.902 --> 04:40.780
Me against Nick St. Clair
in a courtroom battle royale?

04:40.863 --> 04:43.116
-I'd be a laughingstock.
-Cheryl, wait.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.162
It's not just you.
He's done it to other girls.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.748
I mean, hell,
he even tried to do it to me.

04:51.165 --> 04:53.209
The night before the open house.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.420
Did you tell your parents?

04:58.131 --> 05:01.551
Yet you were happy to fill them in
on my after-dark drama?

05:01.968 --> 05:04.304
I won't be a puppet
for your thirst for vengeance.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.682
You want justice?
You go after Nick in court, Veronica.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.689
[Toni] Thanks for letting me sleep over.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.943
Now on to the next crash pad
until my uncle stops locking me out.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.695
[Jughead] My trailer is your trailer.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.532
-Last night was...
-A PG-13 grope session?

05:25.033 --> 05:25.867
Oof.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.288

05:31.122 --> 05:32.749
you're not over Betty.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.877
And I'm not interested
in being anybody's rebound.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.378
Besides...

05:38.838 --> 05:40.840
I'm more into girls anyways.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.011

05:46.971 --> 05:49.474
[Betty] I needed to clear my head,
and I did.

05:49.849 --> 05:54.062
And I realized
that this is just a sick game to him.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.646
Psychological torture.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.232
So...

05:59.650 --> 06:03.946
I'm done with the Black Hood,
with his letters, with his Simon Says.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.366
-What happens when he calls again?
-I won't answer.

06:08.409 --> 06:12.121
I can't... keep playing, I can't.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.999
-Didn't he threaten Polly?
-He did. I talked to her.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.669
People at the farm are gonna
help her disappear until it's safe.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.130
Whenever that is. Jughead and Veronica?

06:21.214 --> 06:25.468
-We have to tell them the truth.
-We will. Let's let things settle first.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.053

and brightest, huh?

06:43.528 --> 06:46.948
-Alice, thank you for hosting.
-Of course, Mayor McCoy.

06:47.031 --> 06:50.576
When I heard what happened,
I decided we should come together

06:50.660 --> 06:55.289
to deal with this motley crew
of liars, dope fiends, and fornicators.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.000
Except for Betty,
who was smart enough to leave

06:58.084 --> 07:00.086
before it was a bacchanalian free-for-all.

07:00.169 --> 07:03.005
-Oh, my God. Mom, please don't.
-Great. Here we go.

-Cut her some slack, Veronica.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.227
-She broke up with Jughead.
-Hashtag "Bughead is no more"?

07:16.310 --> 07:17.562
-Betty didn't tell me?
-Ahem.

07:18.229 --> 07:21.190
Careful throwing stones there,
acid-queen Alice.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.652

behind that mug shot

07:24.735 --> 07:26.863

07:26.946 --> 07:31.242
I, for one, would like to know who brought
the jingle-jangle to the party.

07:35.329 --> 07:39.041
Reginald, not a single word out
of your mouth until we get a lawyer.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.628
All Reggie needs to tell us, Melinda,
is how he acquired it.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.591
-Gang member who deals on the Southside.
-You have a dealer?

07:46.674 --> 07:49.927
Once again, mayor, the Southside
is the source of all our problems.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.221
Is he a Serpent?
Does he go to Southside High?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.931
-I think so.
-[Archie] Does it matter?

07:54.015 --> 07:56.476
-Not all Serpents are dealers.
-Archie, not helping.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.561
We shouldn't have taken the JJ,

07:58.644 --> 08:01.522
but Nick asked Reggie to get it
and then pushed it on us.

08:01.606 --> 08:05.234
He should be in the hot seat.
He's the one who roofied Cheryl--

08:05.318 --> 08:09.447
Prosecuting him would be difficult,
given that all witnesses were high.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.033
Josie and I saw Nick with Cheryl
the night after the party.

for three days.

08:15.828 --> 08:19.040
If I drug-tested you right now,
you'd have a credibility problem.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.708
Josie, you took that drug?

08:21.626 --> 08:23.794
You put that poison in your system

08:23.878 --> 08:26.714
knowing the way your father
struggled with addiction?

08:28.966 --> 08:29.800
I see.

08:31.427 --> 08:32.762
From this moment on,

08:32.845 --> 08:36.307
bringing the Southside under control
is my number one priority.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.351
If it means razing it to the ground

08:38.434 --> 08:41.395
or arresting every single Serpent
in sight,

08:41.479 --> 08:44.232
starting at that high school, so be it.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.109

08:48.694 --> 08:49.779
Now.

with the plagues of the Southside,

09:00.206 --> 09:01.958

But, like the Southside,
there is a community here.

And while the decay is real,
it is not irreversible."

09:12.301 --> 09:14.262

12:42.344 --> 12:44.346
Archie, Riverdale just became
a police state.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.349
McCoy's convinced the Serpents
are dealing jingle-jangle.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.810
Serpents don't deal that stuff.
The Ghoulies do.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.980
-So, tell Mayor McCoy that.
-Oh, Mayor McCoy.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.819
Do you mean the McCoy that just arrested
all my friends for no reason?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.529
Why do you care anyway, man?

13:00.613 --> 13:03.616
I thought you and Betty wanted nothing
to do with me, right?

13:03.699 --> 13:06.327
[Archie] I'm sorry about what happened,
and how it happened.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.787
And as for Betty,
you should maybe talk to her.

13:08.871 --> 13:09.997
[cell phone chimes]

13:13.626 --> 13:16.086
I gotta go. Tall Boy wants to parley.

13:22.801 --> 13:26.597
Sweet cousin, to what do I owe
this unannounced pleasure?

13:26.680 --> 13:29.058
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.852
I'm... compartmentalizing.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.856
But I also see right through you,
Invisible Woman.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.567
I'm writing an article.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.487
On jingle-jangle inundating Riverdale.

13:42.613 --> 13:46.200
-Have you ever heard of the Sugarman?
-Yeah, of course.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.161
What?

13:49.870 --> 13:51.330
As children, Mother told us tales

13:51.413 --> 13:54.750
of how Daddy was friends
with the so-called Sugarman.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.043
And if we were bad,

13:56.126 --> 13:59.380
he'd sneak into our rooms at night,
steal us from our beds,

13:59.463 --> 14:01.465
whisk us away, nevermore to be seen.

14:01.549 --> 14:05.386
Cheryl, is it possible
that this man maybe worked

14:05.469 --> 14:07.721
for your father's drug business?

14:09.139 --> 14:13.519
Dear God, Betty, is there no memory,
however traumatic, you won't defile?

14:13.602 --> 14:15.729
-I'm just trying to get to the truth.
-I've told you.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.358
The Sugarman was a poison confection
spun by my mother to scare children.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.151
Like the sandman or Krampus.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.654
Now, fly away, little bird.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.954
Community service?
Can't you just ground me, Dad?

14:32.037 --> 14:37.251
Community service was Mayor McCoy's idea,
and it's a damn good one if you ask me.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.503
You wanna put that trash in your body,

14:39.587 --> 14:42.423
you can spend the day picking up trash
at Pickens Park.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.883
[sighs]

14:45.009 --> 14:47.636
I know Jug wasn't at your Lollapalooza
the other night,

14:47.720 --> 14:50.973
but he does go to Southside High.
It's ground zero for that crap.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.684
You talking to him, checking in?
How's he doing?

14:53.767 --> 14:55.185
-Trying to.
-Yeah.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.690
It was kind of like that
when I was trying to help FP.

15:00.441 --> 15:04.028
I don't what it is.
A never-ending battle with those two.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.363
I just hope with Jug
it's not a losing one.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.449
[punk music playing]

15:11.744 --> 15:12.745
[Tall Boy] Sit down, kid.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.247
Business to discuss.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.667
Tall Boy, what the hell is this?
Where are we?

15:19.293 --> 15:20.461
You're in my house.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.631
[chuckles]

15:24.089 --> 15:25.716
It's the House of the Dead.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.762
Well, I'm sorry, who the hell are you?

15:29.845 --> 15:31.263
[Tall Boy] Take it easy, Jughead.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.849
Malachai speaks for the Ghoulies.

15:34.475 --> 15:37.478
The heat on us and our ranks depleted,
our tribes need to unite,

15:37.561 --> 15:41.941
and that's gonna be easier to do
if you endorse this partnership.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.943
-Me?
-[Tall Boy] You're FP's son.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.987
That carries weight,
especially with our younger members.

15:47.071 --> 15:50.532
Tall Boy, they're the reason
Southside was even raided.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.661
-Them and their jingle-jangle.
-[Malachai] Chaos is how we thrive.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.955
You'd better get used to it.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.041
Are you seriously gonna do this to my dad?

15:59.375 --> 16:03.045
-You're supposed to be his right hand.
-The Northside declared war today.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.800
Your old man ain't here to call the shots.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.053
And, yeah, I'm his right hand.

16:12.054 --> 16:15.015
That makes me de facto leader
here and now. So...

16:16.350 --> 16:18.143
things are changing, Jones.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.771
Either you change with them...

16:22.356 --> 16:24.441
or suffer the consequences.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.777
[Malachai chuckles]

16:27.486 --> 16:28.821
Evolve or die, baby.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.407
Evolve or die.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.776
[Betty] Sheriff Keller.
The station said you might be here.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.111
I'm off the clock, Betty.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.740
Just a few questions for
a  Blue and Gold  story on jingle-jangle.

17:12.823 --> 17:13.866
[Keller] All right.

17:14.408 --> 17:16.493
One question,
so, you'd better make it good.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.622
Have you ever heard of a dealer
called the Sugarman?

17:21.498 --> 17:25.335
Have I heard of him?
Well, I know him. You know him.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.088
The Sugarman, the Maple Man,
the Delivery Man,

17:28.172 --> 17:31.508
he had about a million different names,
but it was always just one man.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.676
Clifford Blossom.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.470
But he's dead.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.765
So, how is there still a supply
of jingle-jangle?

17:37.848 --> 17:41.518
Jingle-jangle didn't hit the streets
until after Clifford died.

17:41.894 --> 17:45.189
Truth is, anybody could be
the supplier now.

17:46.398 --> 17:47.483
Good night, Betty.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.784
[Veronica] Drafting your next
savage takedown?

18:03.248 --> 18:08.128
[Betty] I don't expect you to believe me,
but I didn't mean what I said.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.797
There's no sane excuse.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.423
[Veronica] No, there isn't.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.050
So, tell me, B...

18:14.301 --> 18:15.761
what's the insane excuse?

18:21.433 --> 18:23.602
[Veronica] So, to recap...

18:25.312 --> 18:28.107
you're talking to a serial killer
on the reg...

18:28.649 --> 18:30.734
and he's been puppet-mastering you?

18:32.986 --> 18:35.656
I'll never forgive myself
for what I did, V.

18:36.740 --> 18:40.327
To you, to Jug, to my mom.
Hell, even to Nick St. Clair.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.788
Girl, I would've given Nick's name

18:42.871 --> 18:45.457
and then happily treated myself
to a facial.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.252
I still may. But, yes...

18:48.669 --> 18:51.755
you're in a toxic relationship
with the Black Hood

18:51.839 --> 18:55.050
-and you need to break up.
-Or I could turn the tables on him, V.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.512
He says he'll go away
if I do one last thing...

18:59.346 --> 19:03.767
find out who's behind the jingle-jangle.
Some creep called the Sugarman.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.769
Okay. So, what's the problem?

19:05.853 --> 19:08.272
[Betty] If the Sugarman exists
and I find out who he is,

19:08.355 --> 19:09.982
I can't just give up his name.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.859
The Black Hood would kill him.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.903
Drug dealer or not,
he's still a human being.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.906
-Barely.
-[Betty] I'm so close, V.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.616
Will you help?

19:23.287 --> 19:24.413
I'm in.

19:27.291 --> 19:31.128
This isn't an alliance with the Ghoulies.
This is a hostile takeover.

19:31.962 --> 19:35.966
God, who knows how long Tall Boy
has been planning on betraying us.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.760
Maybe I stall,
just until Sweet Pea and Toni get out.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.972
I just hope they'd rather go to war
with the Ghoulies than start...

19:42.055 --> 19:43.807
-Jughead.
-...dealing jingle-jangle.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.851
You joined the Serpents to keep the peace.

19:45.934 --> 19:49.479
My dad would never sit back
and let this happen, so, neither will I.

19:50.105 --> 19:55.569
-So, unless you have any better ideas...
-Not me. But, dude, what you just said...

19:59.531 --> 20:01.450
[FP] Start from the beginning, boys.

20:06.538 --> 20:10.500
[Jughead] Hey, you can reprimand me
for joining the Serpents later,

20:10.584 --> 20:12.336
but if we don't do something now...

20:14.254 --> 20:18.175
there will be no more Serpents.
It'll just be the Ghoulies.

20:20.135 --> 20:23.138
Ghoulies dress like fops,
but they're a nasty crew.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.767
The Serpents have survived worse, though.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.230
Much worse. The only hitch is,
it sounds like you're outmanned,

20:31.313 --> 20:34.691
which means you gotta avoid bloodshed
at all costs.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.569
-I agree. A hundred percent.
-[FP] So, outthink them.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.071
This is about territory.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.781
If there's one thing Ghoulies love,

20:40.864 --> 20:43.867
it's their crazy souped-up retro cars
and hearses.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.036
You catch my Riverdale drift, boys?

20:50.290 --> 20:55.003
Challenge them to a street race,
one-on-one.

20:55.087 --> 20:59.007
But keep it on the DL.
It's illegal. It'll get you locked up.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.510
-Go on.
-[FP] Set the terms of the race.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.513
Their guy wins, the Serpents roll over.

21:04.596 --> 21:08.308
But if we win, the Ghoulies back off.

21:08.392 --> 21:13.397
And maybe you raise the stakes.
Whoever wins controls Southside High.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.900
We get rid of the Ghoulies
and get rid of the jingle-jangle

21:16.984 --> 21:18.777
and get McCoy off our back.

21:25.575 --> 21:28.620
[Cheryl] That's me, that's Jason,
and that's the Sugarman.

21:29.204 --> 21:32.457
Remember? You'd tell us tales
of how he was friends with Daddy?

21:32.541 --> 21:35.919
We were to stay up in our rooms
whenever he visited Thornhill?

21:37.212 --> 21:40.132
Was he one of Daddy's business associates?

21:41.216 --> 21:45.178
Not maple syrup,
but the other kind of business?

21:47.431 --> 21:50.642
After all you kept from me about Daddy,
about Jason's death,

21:50.726 --> 21:53.186
is this another piece
of your cryptic puzzle?

21:53.270 --> 21:56.231
As usual, Cheryl, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.109
I never told you any such stories.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.111
As for your father's business dealings,

22:01.194 --> 22:05.324
you know full well that all his records
were either seized by the police

22:05.407 --> 22:08.160
or burned in the fire you started.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.540
[Kevin groans]

22:14.708 --> 22:19.504
-Pickens Park? More like Needle Park.
-I wouldn't even go cruising here.

22:21.923 --> 22:24.468
Hey, uh, feel free to, you know, pitch in.

22:25.093 --> 22:30.599
I get you're pretty much Beyoncé,
but today, you're just like us commoners.

22:30.682 --> 22:33.226
I think your biceps can handle it, Mantle.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.729
-You trying to get me to flex?
-[Veronica] Josie.

22:35.812 --> 22:38.607
You mind if I borrow Reggie
for a New York minute?

22:38.690 --> 22:40.317
Please. Take him.

22:41.276 --> 22:43.445
Love watching me walk away, huh?

22:45.447 --> 22:46.782
What do you want, Veronica?

22:46.865 --> 22:49.117
We were kind of
in the middle of something.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.828
I want the name
of your jingle-jangle contact,

22:51.912 --> 22:53.747
and I won't take no for an answer.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.001
Betty, you have to talk to Jughead.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.212
Soon, I promise.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.632
I just need to take care of a few things.

23:15.685 --> 23:19.356
I'll go out on a limb
and guess you're Verne. You got my stuff?

23:21.191 --> 23:24.069
-I don't take American Excess.
-Will this do?

23:25.278 --> 23:27.114
My girl and I
need a reason to live tonight.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.699
She broke up with her beau.
Full spiral. Tragic.

23:30.325 --> 23:31.159
One fifty.

23:32.452 --> 23:35.122
I know you're overcharging me,
but I'm desperate.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.625
My compliments to the Sugarman.

23:40.836 --> 23:45.215
Did I get it wrong? Isn't that the name
of the genius behind these sweet treats?

23:45.298 --> 23:46.633
Have you ever met him?

23:48.510 --> 23:50.345
What about my change, asshat?

23:54.015 --> 23:56.726
Our Drugstore Cowboy
should be passing you

23:56.810 --> 24:00.063
in three... two... one.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.731
I've got eyes on him.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.318
[rock music playing]

24:05.402 --> 24:06.403
[Jughead] Me and my boy...

24:07.571 --> 24:09.364
wanna challenge you to a race.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.033
If we win...

24:13.285 --> 24:15.078
Serpents remain autonomous...

24:15.579 --> 24:17.914
and you quit dealing at Southside High.

24:19.332 --> 24:20.876
[sniffs] And if we win?

24:21.626 --> 24:22.544
We fold...

24:23.420 --> 24:27.090
and you can continue polluting Southside
with your little straws of death.

24:27.174 --> 24:31.595
So, the mighty Serpent Prince
has some stones, but not much else.

24:31.678 --> 24:35.015
So, unless Your Highness wants to put some
of Daddy's territory on the table,

24:35.098 --> 24:36.808
I got no reason to agree to a race.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.143
[door slams]

24:38.226 --> 24:40.687
They were following me.
Tried to get in the garage.

24:40.770 --> 24:41.897
-Veronica?
-Betty?

24:41.980 --> 24:42.981
-Archie?
-Jughead?

24:43.565 --> 24:45.275
[all] What are you doing here?

24:45.817 --> 24:49.779
-Wait. So, these are your bitches?
-I beg your misogynistic pardon?

24:49.863 --> 24:53.033
Why don't you take your skanks
and get the hell out of here?

24:53.116 --> 24:56.244
Until you make me a better offer,
there'll be no race.

24:56.328 --> 25:00.332
If you win...
we'll give you the Whyte Wyrm.

25:01.625 --> 25:06.338
You can expand your drug-dealing horizons
and upgrade out of this literal hellhole.

25:06.421 --> 25:10.008
We'll take the Wyrm
and Sunnyside Trailer Park.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.438
[Nick] Two turkey burgers
and a Cobb salad. To go.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.651
Sharon.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.402
Cheryl.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.865
What are you still doing in town, Nick?

25:33.949 --> 25:36.117
[Nick] Picking up some fuel
for the trip home.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.786
How are you?

25:38.495 --> 25:39.412
How am I?

25:42.082 --> 25:43.375
How am I?

25:44.251 --> 25:45.126
You roofied me.

25:46.044 --> 25:49.631
-You tried to rape me.
-I don't think that's what happened.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.926
You're a  Less Than Zero  monster.

25:53.009 --> 25:55.971
At least I'm not a desperate tart
from a truck-stop town, hon.

25:56.429 --> 25:59.474
Let's not distort reality
to cover your morning-after shame.

25:59.557 --> 26:02.560
You were high, half-naked
and begging for it.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.230
Call your lawyer.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.733
Seeing as you're
such an unrepentant spore,

26:08.817 --> 26:11.111
I think I'll be pressing charges
after all.

26:11.569 --> 26:14.906
Sweetie, did no one tell you
about the arrangement my parents made

26:14.990 --> 26:16.658
with your cobra-like mother?

26:17.450 --> 26:20.412
You're not gonna be saying anything
about that night to anyone.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.624
After all, there's a reason
it's called hush money.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.754
For the lady's meal, as well.

26:33.633 --> 26:37.470
[Betty] God bless Reggie Mantle
and his inferiority complex.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.100
His car's a lot like him.
It's beautiful to look at...

26:42.183 --> 26:44.436
but not much going on under the hood.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.398
Um, crescent wrench, please.

26:51.818 --> 26:52.652
Thank you.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.662
So, this is what Serpents do for fun, huh?
Street-race rival gangs?

27:02.746 --> 27:04.664
[Jughead] Just go ahead and say it, Betty.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.464
You said you weren't gonna join them, Jug.

27:12.547 --> 27:16.217
And you said you loved me,
and then you dumped me via Archie.

27:17.385 --> 27:21.222
Which, by the way,
way worse than via text.

27:22.432 --> 27:23.475
[sighs]

27:23.558 --> 27:26.227
I'm sorry, Jughead.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.107
It won't make any sense...

27:32.442 --> 27:36.905
but everything around us was imploding,
and I did it to protect you.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.660
Betty, you did the one thing
that could actually hurt me.

27:42.744 --> 27:46.498
I will explain everything to you, Jug,
I will.

27:48.416 --> 27:51.544
But right now, I just wanna get you
through this race.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.679
[Cheryl] I had the most fascinating chat
with Nick today.

28:01.763 --> 28:05.058
Then I went rummaging around your bedroom
until I found this.

28:06.351 --> 28:10.146
Before you start casting stones,
you should kn--

28:11.648 --> 28:14.734
The Lodges are still accepting money
from the St. Clairs

28:14.818 --> 28:18.822
-for their precious SoDale construction.
-I don't care about them.

28:18.905 --> 28:20.782
I care about my mother.

28:23.284 --> 28:27.288
You defend Daddy
even after he murdered your son...

28:29.916 --> 28:31.626
but you won't stand up for me.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.130
Not even against my would-be rapist.

28:35.213 --> 28:37.298
Oh, don't be absurd, Cheryl.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.634
And give me that check.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.682
Not until you tell me the truth
about the Sugarman.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.392
He exists, Mother.

28:47.475 --> 28:48.852
We both know it.

28:49.310 --> 28:50.562
He worked with Daddy.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.313
Your father--

28:52.397 --> 28:55.734
Was an awful human being,
and thank God he's dead.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.820
But I'm alive, and I'm begging you...

29:00.113 --> 29:03.241
for once in your life, be honest with me.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.286
Care about me more.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.545
It's simple.

29:17.213 --> 29:19.591
The St. Clairs bought your silence.

29:19.716 --> 29:23.303
But you're not getting paid
until I hear the truth.

29:30.268 --> 29:31.686
What can I say...

29:33.855 --> 29:34.689
or do...

29:36.107 --> 29:38.026
to get you to stay here with me?

29:39.819 --> 29:43.114
Instead of going to that dangerous...

29:43.656 --> 29:47.118
dumb, possibly deadly street race?

29:48.411 --> 29:50.497
Don't worry, Ronnie, I have a plan.

29:52.665 --> 29:56.669
Like the plan you and Betty had
when you snuck into Ghoulie headquarters.

29:57.712 --> 29:58.963
[Veronica chuckles]

30:00.757 --> 30:04.677
-Touché.
-One that hopefully keeps everyone alive.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.763
[cell phone buzzing]

30:09.557 --> 30:10.475
Cheryl?

30:12.352 --> 30:13.394
What? Slow down.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.440
They what?

30:21.903 --> 30:24.572
Are you still doing business
with the St. Clairs?

30:25.156 --> 30:27.450
Letting them invest in SoDale
after what Nick did?

30:27.534 --> 30:30.537
-To be fair, Cheryl's accusations--
-Cheryl's telling the truth.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.665
I know, because Nick tried to do it to me.

30:37.168 --> 30:39.587
Nick St. Clair... hurt you?

30:39.671 --> 30:40.880
[Veronica] Tried to.

30:40.964 --> 30:44.926
But I stopped him before he got too far.
The next night, he went after Cheryl.

30:45.009 --> 30:48.888
-Veronica, why didn't you say something?
-I didn't have any proof.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.724
And Nick has done it before,
I'm sure of it.

30:51.808 --> 30:55.687
Veronica, as God is my witness,
I swear to you, I will--

30:55.770 --> 30:59.607
Under no circumstances
will we take a penny from that family.

31:00.942 --> 31:04.195
All right, let's do this!

31:04.279 --> 31:05.738
[all] All right!

31:05.822 --> 31:08.992
Not the kind of drag race
I ever imagined myself going to,

31:09.075 --> 31:10.869
but at least the guys are hot.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.162
[rock music playing]

31:14.205 --> 31:15.874
[Archie] Don't worry, Ronnie, we got this.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.667
Just make it back to me.

31:17.750 --> 31:20.295
Preferably in one piece, Archiekins.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.344
[Betty] Before you get in the car,
I need you to know...

31:31.723 --> 31:33.892
I never stopped loving you, Jug.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.978
I'm not sure I can.

31:38.062 --> 31:42.984
Also remember, don't ride the clutch,
and don't let it slip between gear shifts.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.029
You're an enigma, Cooper.

31:46.112 --> 31:48.406
-Let's do it!
-[all] Yeah!

31:48.489 --> 31:50.491
[crowd cheering]

31:53.244 --> 31:54.871
[Tall Boy] Get these cars up in a row!

32:03.212 --> 32:06.257
Race over Herk Harvey Bridge
to Dead Man's Curve.

32:06.341 --> 32:07.926
First one back here wins.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.929
-Uh, I usually do the honors.
-Not today, Cha-Cha.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.639
I was born for this moment.

32:18.144 --> 32:19.562
[engines revving]

32:28.446 --> 32:31.074
Engines warm and ready, gentlemen?

32:53.388 --> 32:54.222
[crowd cheering]

32:54.305 --> 32:56.224
[rock music playing]

33:07.527 --> 33:08.820
Whoo.

33:09.821 --> 33:10.655
Damn it.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.703
[yells]

33:21.708 --> 33:24.502
-Jug, we're coming up to the bridge.
-I know. I got this.

33:24.585 --> 33:27.005
It's too narrow for both of us, Jughead.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.303
Jug, we should abort.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.681
-And let them win?
-We will both crash on that bridge.

33:36.764 --> 33:39.892
Serpents are joining the Ghoulies
over my dead body, Archie.

33:41.269 --> 33:44.105
I'm sorry, man,
but I'm not down for those terms.

33:44.605 --> 33:46.607
[tires squealing]

33:55.908 --> 33:57.035
Why would you do that?

33:57.118 --> 33:59.287
Trust me, Jug,
you're gonna thank me for this.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.372
[sirens wailing]

34:02.123 --> 34:05.209
[Archie] Jug, stop! Jug! Jug!

34:05.293 --> 34:06.127
Jug!

34:16.763 --> 34:19.223
Come on, Jug, we gotta go. Come on.

34:23.102 --> 34:26.147
Everyone scatter!
The cops are rounding up Ghoulies!

34:30.526 --> 34:33.362
-[Veronica] Oh, my God, you're okay.
-We gotta get out of here.

34:33.446 --> 34:36.032
-Come on, we gotta go. Right now.
-[Tall Boy] You called the cops?

34:37.116 --> 34:39.494
You won't throw in with the Ghoulies,
but you will with cops?

34:39.577 --> 34:42.455
-Where's the honor in that?
-Calm down, Tall Boy.

34:42.538 --> 34:45.416
-You think I knew Keller would be there?
-I called Keller.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.293
What the hell, Archie?

34:47.376 --> 34:49.045
Did my dad tell you about this, too?

34:49.128 --> 34:52.173
No, this was my idea
to get rid of the Ghoulies. It worked.

34:52.256 --> 34:54.467
They get arrested for racing,
they're off the chessboard.

34:54.550 --> 34:56.385
For how long? One month? Three months?

34:56.469 --> 34:58.513
You know what they'll want
on the other side?

34:58.596 --> 35:01.224
Your head on a stake! All of ours!

35:14.195 --> 35:16.280
Careful you don't get burned again.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.868
You said I never protected you.

35:24.539 --> 35:25.873
The Sugarman...

35:27.291 --> 35:29.085
was a story I concocted...

35:29.961 --> 35:33.464
to turn an all-too-real monster

35:33.548 --> 35:35.508
into a child's bogeyman.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.593
And it worked, for a while.

35:38.511 --> 35:40.012
But now I need the truth.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.727
Over the years,
there were many Sugarmen...

35:48.229 --> 35:50.189
each taking over for the last.

35:53.734 --> 35:55.361
When Clifford decided

35:55.444 --> 35:58.656
to groom your brother
to take over the family business...

35:59.991 --> 36:03.161
he wanted him
to meet the current Sugarman.

36:06.289 --> 36:09.417
I protested, but your father insisted...

36:10.668 --> 36:12.003
and God help me...

36:13.838 --> 36:18.551
so began the terrible series of events
that led to Jason's death.

36:21.596 --> 36:22.722
[sobs]

36:50.833 --> 36:53.461
Thank you for that, Mommy.

36:54.754 --> 36:58.257
One more question:
Who is the Sugarman right now?

36:59.717 --> 37:02.053
[cell phone ringing]

37:03.763 --> 37:05.640
Oh, my God, is that the Black Hood?

37:08.809 --> 37:09.810
It's Cheryl.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.230
Hey.

37:13.898 --> 37:14.732
You did?

37:16.859 --> 37:17.777
Who is he?

37:20.446 --> 37:22.240
Wait, are you positive?

37:26.410 --> 37:27.245
Betty?

37:29.538 --> 37:32.083
Cheryl just told me the Sugarman's name.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.753
Oh, my God, Cheryl Bombshell for the win.

37:37.880 --> 37:38.756
[sighs]

37:40.174 --> 37:42.009
What do I do, Veronica?

37:43.844 --> 37:47.515
If I give the Black Hood his name,
may God have mercy on the Sugarman.

37:47.598 --> 37:48.599
And if I don't...

37:50.059 --> 37:52.103
may God have mercy on all of us.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.358
[cell phone ringing]

38:04.949 --> 38:06.617
I assume my time's up?

38:06.701 --> 38:09.287
[Black Hood]  Yes, Betty.
Have you found him for me?

38:09.745 --> 38:10.579
I did.

38:11.038 --> 38:13.749
Good girl. Now tell me his name.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.628
I could.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.924
But that wouldn't do you any good now.

38:23.217 --> 38:25.678
I've already notified
the sheriff's office.

38:27.013 --> 38:31.434
You'll have to read his name in the exposé
I just published in the  Blue and Gold.

38:33.894 --> 38:34.979
Care to comment?

38:35.980 --> 38:38.149
I told you what would happen.

38:38.733 --> 38:43.946
The Sugarman needed to be brought
to justice, not execution.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.782
He will be dealt with in the right way.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.118
You're playing a risky game.

38:52.121 --> 38:52.955
Yeah...

38:54.749 --> 38:56.167
but it's my game now.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.544
Which is what, Betty?

38:58.919 --> 39:01.589
A game that ends with me catching you.

39:03.341 --> 39:07.470
I found out who killed Jason Blossom.
I found out who the Sugarman was.

39:11.223 --> 39:14.310
You're next, Black Hood.

39:17.146 --> 39:19.231
I'm breathing down your neck.

39:21.525 --> 39:22.610

39:29.367 --> 39:31.118
[Jughead]
What are the other Serpents saying?

39:31.702 --> 39:35.623
Some people give you props for
challenging the Ghoulies and beating them.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.666
Others hate that you
cut a deal with Keller

39:37.750 --> 39:40.920
-because it puts us in bed with the pigs.
-I didn't. That was Archie.

39:41.003 --> 39:43.631

and you know that, but some of them don't.

[Archie]
Jughead was in one of his classes.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.584
-How's he dealing?
-Honestly, Dad, I'm not sure.

40:21.544 --> 40:25.673
I tried helping Jughead with something,
and it backfired. He's pretty pissed off.
