00:01.300 --> 00:03.564
(rock music plays)

00:07.700 --> 00:10.237
* You think that
you got It made *

00:10.270 --> 00:12.238
* You think you're running
the game *

00:12.280 --> 00:13.770
* But really
you're being played *

00:13.810 --> 00:15.232
* And you think
that you're bulletproof *

00:15.280 --> 00:16.645
* But just you wait
till the roof *

00:16.680 --> 00:19.148
* Comes crashing in on you

00:19.180 --> 00:23.480
* You're going to be sorry
that you ever saw my face *

00:23.520 --> 00:28.287
* You're going to get-get
what's coming to you *

00:28.320 --> 00:30.424
* Get-get what's coming
to you *

00:30.460 --> 00:34.351
* Get-get
what's coming to you. *

00:36.370 --> 00:40.739
Paisley Group already leads
the other Fortune 500 companies

00:40.770 --> 00:43.159
in the global and industry trend

00:43.210 --> 00:45.838
toward consumer use
of green products,

00:45.870 --> 00:48.202
while providing
competitive advantages

00:48.240 --> 00:50.276
(bullhorn sounds outside)
in efficacy and safety.

00:50.310 --> 00:51.743
Now, this doesn't mean...

00:51.780 --> 00:53.543
CROWD (chanting):
Not now. Not ever.

00:53.580 --> 00:58.142
Ah... sounds like our
protestor friends agree With us.

00:58.190 --> 01:00.408
(laughter)
Now is not the time for brunch.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.654
(laughter)

01:01.690 --> 01:03.157
All right. In short,

01:03.190 --> 01:04.521
the merger of
our two great companies

01:04.560 --> 01:07.199
will ensure
our competitive edge.

01:07.230 --> 01:08.356
But more important,

01:08.400 --> 01:10.265
for the pension funds
you manage;

01:10.300 --> 01:12.689
it'll mean a greater return
on your investments.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.230
(chanting continues)
Now... are there any questions?

01:14.270 --> 01:15.464
Yeah. Mr. Paisley.

01:15.500 --> 01:19.277
How much domestic workforce
would you anticipate shedding

01:19.310 --> 01:20.334
as a result of this merger?

01:20.380 --> 01:22.678
You sound like one of
the protestors out there.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.371
(laughter)

01:24.410 --> 01:25.570
Regrettably,
it could be as much as

01:25.610 --> 01:27.146
20 percent stateside.

01:27.180 --> 01:29.512
We're gonna hope
to hold to that line.

01:29.550 --> 01:30.744
What about the _
wrongful termination swt

01:30.790 --> 01:32.314
by your former CFO?

01:32.360 --> 01:33.384
Well, I'm not stupid.

01:33.420 --> 01:35.285
I'll leave that to my lavwer.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.878
(laughter)

01:36.930 --> 01:39.694
Yes. We're confident
that this suit has no merit...

01:39.730 --> 01:41.197
He's claiming he was fired
because he was gay.

01:41.230 --> 01:42.322
Yes. He's claiming that.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.361
Kyle Musset
was fired for cause.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.698
He was attempting
to sell trade secrets

01:46.740 --> 01:48.230
to a competitor...

01:48.270 --> 01:49.339
If the suit drags on...

01:49.370 --> 01:50.906
it could hang over
the stock price.

01:50.940 --> 01:53.204
Well, we're in negotiations now
and we're confident

01:53.240 --> 01:54.400
that this suit will set...

01:54.440 --> 01:55.372
(all exclaim)

01:55.410 --> 01:57.901
Down with_ _
corporate Imperialism!

01:57.950 --> 02:00.373
* Get-get what's coming

02:00.420 --> 02:01.614
(laughing)

02:01.650 --> 02:03.811
Didn't I tell you
this was gonna be fun?

02:03.850 --> 02:05.613
* Get-get what's coming

02:05.650 --> 02:07.811
* To you.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.282
(indistinct conversation)

02:09.330 --> 02:10.729
Mr. Canning, hello.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.591
Alicia's just
a few minutes behind you.

02:12.630 --> 02:14.621
So, this is what
a start-up looks like.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.423
Yep.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.892
35 employees.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.238
Seven partners.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.635
$21 million
in yearly billing.

02:20.670 --> 02:22.262
Another $5 million
and you'll be able to

02:22.310 --> 02:23.504
afford doors for
your conference room.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.201
It's a design choice.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.309
(scoffs)
Yeah, the design choice

02:26.340 --> 02:28.570
that lets other people
listen in on your meetings.

02:28.610 --> 02:32.239
ALICIA:
Lindsay, can you
get my sweater from m...?

02:32.280 --> 02:34.248
Oh. Mr. Canning.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.440
We ready
to put this to bed?

02:35.480 --> 02:36.447
Yeah. I'm ready for court, uh...

02:36.490 --> 02:38.287
I think we just honor
our trial date tomorrow.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.288
My goodness,
what happened to you?

02:40.320 --> 02:42.185
Or is that, uh,
another design choice?

02:42.230 --> 02:43.720
Excuse me.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.227
It was a mishap.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.728
We, uh, considered
your client's latest demands...

02:47.760 --> 02:50.695
and, um,
our top offering is $150,000.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.334
We'll take our chances in court.

02:52.370 --> 02:53.689
Good. That was quick.

02:53.740 --> 02:54.968
Good to see you.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.900
He was fired
because he was gay.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.362
How's that gonna go over
with your fund managers?

02:58.410 --> 03:01.800
Like extortion.
You're lucky to get $150,000.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.501
$200,000.

03:03.550 --> 03:06.348
N0. $140,000.

03:06.380 --> 03:08.678
You have changed.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.948
Yes. I have.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.254
I liked the
old Alicia better.

03:12.290 --> 03:13.450
The $200,000 Alicia?

03:13.490 --> 03:14.457
All right, fine.

03:14.490 --> 03:15.582
I'll talk to my client,

03:15.620 --> 03:18.487
you talk to your... corporate
overlord and then, uh...

03:18.530 --> 03:19.292
in the meantime,
get that cleaned up,

03:19.330 --> 03:20.649
cause, it's gonna
leave a stain.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.258
Yeah. Thanks.

03:23.730 --> 03:25.220
Finn. What's up?
Hey.

03:25.270 --> 03:26.339
Alicia, I'm sorry,
am I early?

03:26.370 --> 03:27.632
Fo_r?
Eli.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.763
We have a meeting about
the governor's announcement.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.402
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I completely forgot.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.668
You okay?

03:32.710 --> 03:34.337
Oh, yeah.
Someone hit me with a pie.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.472
It's a long story.

03:35.510 --> 03:37.307
Good news. Great news.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.238
Where can we talk?
How about your desk?

03:40.450 --> 03:41.974
I got an early copy.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.681
Comes out tonight
and it couldn't be

03:43.720 --> 03:44.948
more perfect.
Eli, what is it?

03:44.990 --> 03:47.481
Oh, Alicia, maybe
you shouldn't look.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.329
It's the report on the
Jeffrey Grant shooting.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.657
No, I'm fine, Eli.
What's it say?

03:50.690 --> 03:53.625
Well, it clears Finn
of any wrongdoing...

03:53.660 --> 03:55.423
What happened
to your...
Pie. What's it say,

03:55.460 --> 03:56.529
Eli?

03:56.570 --> 03:58.458
It clears Finn of any
responsibility

03:58.500 --> 04:00.036
for the shooting and
lays the blame firmly

04:00.070 --> 04:01.935
at the feet of the
state's attorney.
That's good.

04:01.970 --> 04:04.336
It's great.
How'd you get pie on you?
So,

04:04.370 --> 04:06.474
_ P_eter will reference it
in his public endorsement?
Yes.

04:06.510 --> 04:08.808
Now here's the thing-- this is
the most dangerous time for you.
Because

04:08.840 --> 04:11.502
Castro will try to strike back.
He'll try and

04:11.550 --> 04:13.609
undercut this report by
exposing something on you.

04:13.650 --> 04:15.413
Well, that's good,
there is nothing on me.

04:15.450 --> 04:16.542
Eh.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.443
Your sister's overdose,

04:17.490 --> 04:18.639
your wife's miscarriage.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.419
What's wrong
with my wife's miscarriage?

04:20.460 --> 04:23.452
You divorced her after
the miscarriage...
Eli.

04:23.490 --> 04:26.323
Why don't we
do this another time?
I didn't divorce her.

04:26.360 --> 04:27.349
Oh, come on,
you don't understand.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.753
This is not about the facts.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.462
It's what the facts can
be made to look like.
What do you need,

04:31.500 --> 04:33.730
Eli?
Castro is gonna try
and get in touch with you

04:33.770 --> 04:35.635
with whatever he has--
a photo, a Xerox,

04:35.670 --> 04:37.900
something from your past.
Bring it to me.

04:37.940 --> 04:40.500
Whatever it is,
it'll make you angry,

04:40.540 --> 04:43.941
but bring it to me. Okay?

04:43.980 --> 04:45.743
Okay.

04:45.780 --> 04:46.747
Good.

04:46.780 --> 04:48.372
I'm gonna go.

04:50.450 --> 04:53.055
(sighs) I still can't
get used to this place.

04:53.090 --> 04:55.615
You need more walls.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.026
Well, he's a barrel of laughs.

04:58.060 --> 05:00.494
Yes, he takes his
job very seriously.

05:00.530 --> 05:01.849
And there's no
one better at it.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.460
Look, I-I'd advise
against court.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.469
I just...
WOMAN: ...has happened
14 separate times.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.899
And that should
prove causation.

05:08.940 --> 05:12.034
Who's that in with Diane?
Some lady.

05:12.070 --> 05:13.378
(scoffs)
She doesn't like men.

05:13.410 --> 05:15.378
No, I mean who are the people?

05:15.410 --> 05:18.004
The people. In there?
Yes.

05:18.050 --> 05:19.574
I don't know.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.349
What do I call you?
Is it, uh,

05:21.380 --> 05:23.917
crippled or handicapped or...
What's that other word?

05:23.950 --> 05:25.542
Uh, the, uh...
What do you call me?

05:25.590 --> 05:26.716
Yeah.
Uh, how about Louis?

05:26.760 --> 05:31.026
No, when I'm talking to other
people, what do I call you?

05:31.060 --> 05:32.994
Challenged.

05:33.030 --> 05:35.396
Hmm? Isn't that
the word-- challenged?

05:35.430 --> 05:36.522
Do you like that?

05:36.570 --> 05:37.628
Yes.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.697
...we'll serve Kael Pepper...
Diane.

05:40.740 --> 05:41.968
Do you... Do
you need me?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.036
No.

05:44.070 --> 05:45.560
Mr. Canning.

05:45.610 --> 05:47.874
Hello, I'm Rayna Hecht.
Well, Ms. Hecht,

05:47.910 --> 05:48.729
from Hecht & Tascioni?

05:48.780 --> 05:50.645
You run a tight
little shop over there.

05:50.680 --> 05:51.874
Thank you, we try.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.639
So, what do we got going?

05:53.680 --> 05:55.739
Class action.
KaelPeppen

05:55.780 --> 05:57.680
Oh, that was...
That was terrible.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.711
Uh, I didn't know
we signed it.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.409
Uh, Rayna asked us
to be co-counsel.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.484
My goodness.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.827
Good luck.

06:03.860 --> 06:05.657
Terrible thing.

06:05.690 --> 06:06.827
All those children.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.851
(deep breath)

06:12.640 --> 06:14.130
Is there something wrong?

06:14.170 --> 06:15.660
Office politics.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.964
(chuckles)
Oh, I know that tune.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.672
So, I know

06:20.710 --> 06:22.746
it will be difficult
talking about the illnesses,

06:22.780 --> 06:24.577
but the stories
that you've told us,

06:24.610 --> 06:25.838
you'll
have to repeat.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.677
KaHnda.
Hmm?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.540
Something is going on
in that little head of his.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.740
Could you find out?
Canning?

06:31.790 --> 06:33.553
Yes. He came in here,

06:33.590 --> 06:35.512
heard about _
the Kael Pepper class action,

06:35.560 --> 06:37.425
and then rushed off.

06:37.460 --> 06:39.451
I'll find out.

06:41.130 --> 06:43.792
NEWS ANCHOR:
Good things come to those who
wait? Well, I guess...

06:43.830 --> 06:46.060
ALICIA: $140,000.
(Paisley sighs)

06:46.100 --> 06:48.568
I don't know why we have to pay
him a cent-- he's a thief.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.534
Because we have a court date
set for tomorrow

06:50.570 --> 06:52.709
if we don't settle this.
Mr. Paisley,

06:52.740 --> 06:55.072
the merger's worth
$3.7 billion.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.771
$140,000 is nothing.

06:56.810 --> 06:58.539
It's a lot of money.
To me, yeah.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.844
To you, it's what you made
while you were sitting here.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.780
(soft laugh)

07:02.820 --> 07:04.185
I like that sweater.

07:04.220 --> 07:05.881
Thanks.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.512
Send me your
cleaning bill.

07:07.560 --> 07:11.519
Agree to pay $140,000 and
I'll pay the cleaning bill.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.596
(laughs)

07:13.630 --> 07:15.450
WOMAN:
Mr. Paisley,
we're ready for you.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.718
You know what I like
about you, Alicia?

07:17.770 --> 07:19.192
I have no idea.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.835
You don't take
this stuff too seriously.

07:21.870 --> 07:25.567
You and me together
on the barricades, huh?

07:25.610 --> 07:26.634
(sighs)

07:26.680 --> 07:28.636
Hold off the hordes.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.671
$140,000?

07:32.880 --> 07:34.575
Pay 'em off.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.645
Don't even want
to think about it again.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.750
It's called "merger insanity."

07:39.790 --> 07:42.850
The new wave of big ticket deals
sweeping the biotech industry.

07:42.890 --> 07:46.189
And the newest merger has an
old, respected name at the helm.

07:46.230 --> 07:48.494
James Paisley.
Hi there.

07:48.530 --> 07:49.963
We'll be joined by
Mr. Paisley shortly...

07:50.000 --> 07:52.764
Geez, Kalinda,
don't startle me like that.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.562
Do you have a minute?

07:53.600 --> 07:56.091
For you, all the
time in the world.

07:56.140 --> 07:58.005
What's wrong with
the Kael Pepper class action?

07:58.040 --> 07:59.769
I don't know. Is
there something wrong

07:59.810 --> 08:01.607
with the Kael Pepper
class action?

08:03.810 --> 08:06.278
Now, this relationship here--
the one between us--

08:06.310 --> 08:07.948
is only gonna work
if we're gonna

08:07.980 --> 08:09.914
be up front with each other.

08:09.950 --> 08:12.111
Diane has asked me
to find out

08:12.150 --> 08:14.084
why you have a problem
with her class action.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.951
Now, I could investigate...

08:15.990 --> 08:17.685
As you did with
my health issues.
or...

08:17.730 --> 08:19.789
we could be adults.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.697
Just ask questions and talk.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.993
I'm in the process of signing
Kael Pepper labs.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.689
Now, we can't represent
both the company

08:28.740 --> 08:30.162
and the people who are suing

08:30.210 --> 08:31.029
the company.
True.

08:31.070 --> 08:32.799
So I have to figure
out a way to...

08:32.840 --> 08:35.673
just... wait. Just a sec.
...Mr._ James
Paisley.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.144
I understand there was
a bit of drama

08:38.180 --> 08:40.819
at your presentation to the top
pension fund managers.

08:40.850 --> 08:41.942
Oh, you mean
the pie incident.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.743
Wait, turn it up.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.985
Someone from the protest
infiltrated your meeting

08:46.020 --> 08:47.248
and hit you with a pie.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.554
Not even a very tasty
pie, I might add.

08:49.590 --> 08:52.855
And was this to protest
the fact that this merger

08:52.900 --> 08:54.253
would be sending
jobs overseas.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.768
Honestly, Steven, I don't
know what it's about.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.597
I don't know what
these people want.

08:58.630 --> 09:00.996
I'm standing in my board
room, people downstairs

09:01.040 --> 09:04.259
handcuffing themselves
to the receptionist's desk,

09:04.310 --> 09:06.835
honking horns, not letting
us out of the building.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.007
I felt like, uh...

09:09.040 --> 09:10.246
Anne Frank,

09:10.280 --> 09:12.748
hiding from
the Nazis.
No, no.

09:12.780 --> 09:14.668
Well, that's a bit
extreme, isn't it?
(cackles)

09:14.720 --> 09:17.780
Not really. I feel this
country's turned on its head.

09:17.820 --> 09:20.789
Tom Perkins may have
put it inelegantly,

09:20.820 --> 09:22.253
but he wasn't
that far wrong.

09:22.290 --> 09:24.155
Don't say it. Don't say it.

09:24.190 --> 09:25.350
Go for it, go for it, say it.

09:25.390 --> 09:28.826
The one percent is the new
hunted minority in this country.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.794
N_ot unlike the Jews
in Na2i Germany.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.991
Goal!

09:33.040 --> 09:34.769
(groans)

09:34.800 --> 09:36.961
Don't call him now, he'll
just know you're on the run

09:37.010 --> 09:39.672
and he'll up the price.
We have to risk it.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.701
As soon as he sees this, he's
gonna want to go to court.

09:41.740 --> 09:42.809
It doesn't change the facts.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.647
It taints the jury pool.
(line ringing)

09:44.680 --> 09:46.819
(phone ringing)
I wonder how long
I should make her wait.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.780
Uh_...
Hi.

09:50.820 --> 09:51.787
He saw the interview.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.617
KaHnda?

09:53.660 --> 09:55.878
(mouthing)
Yeah, he watched the whole
interview. Hang on.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.353
That was really crappy.

09:57.390 --> 09:59.381
I know.
Hey, Alicia,

09:59.430 --> 10:01.250
uh, we're gonna
take our chances in court.
Your case

10:01.300 --> 10:04.292
is weak.
Yeah, we both know
it's not about the case anymore.

10:04.330 --> 10:07.231
It's about jury selection
and, uh, it's gonna be over

10:07.270 --> 10:09.329
before you can say, "Ladies
and gentlemen of the jury."

10:09.370 --> 10:11.235
We'll go up to $200,000.

10:11.270 --> 10:12.669
Nope, it's now $3 million.

10:12.710 --> 10:16.077
(mouthing)

10:16.110 --> 10:17.270
Then we'll see you in court.

10:17.310 --> 10:19.073
That's my line.
(beeps)

10:21.120 --> 10:22.849
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice, Peter.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.812
Jim.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.859
So.

10:28.890 --> 10:30.858
What can I do for you?

10:30.890 --> 10:34.428
It's about the state's attorney
race and Finn Polmar.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.098
Well, I figured as much.

10:36.130 --> 10:38.098
Are you referring to the
attorney general's report?

10:38.130 --> 10:41.133
Apparently the worst-kept
secret in Illinois.

10:41.170 --> 10:43.434
I did approve
the charges.

10:43.470 --> 10:46.337
I thought they
were justified.

10:46.370 --> 10:49.874
But I certainly never put a
gun in Jeffrey Grant's hand.

10:49.910 --> 10:52.105
I think the voters
will see that.

10:53.150 --> 10:55.072
Well, great. Great.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.441
Okay, so,
it was good talking to you.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.310
(sighs)

11:08.330 --> 11:10.469
It's Finn Polmar

11:10.500 --> 11:12.320
coming out of your
wife's apartment building.

11:12.370 --> 11:13.837
(laughs)

11:13.870 --> 11:15.462
That's really pathetic, Jim.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.468
I didn't take the
picture, Peter.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.001
It's from a
surveillance camera.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.804
Yeah, well, I think you'll see
that I was there, also.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.101
Two months ago.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.106
My wife was
representing Finn...

11:26.150 --> 11:27.708
against you, I believe.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.672
This is from two weeks ago.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.718
I'm not gonna use it, Peter,

11:33.760 --> 11:36.854
but it will come out.

11:36.890 --> 11:38.858
Finn will be
asked about it.

11:38.890 --> 11:40.790
Your wife will
be asked about it.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.821
You'll be
asked about it.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.965
How do you think
it will look

11:48.000 --> 11:50.104
that you endorsed
your wife's lover?

11:53.240 --> 11:55.231
(sighs)

11:58.510 --> 11:59.772
(sighs)

11:59.820 --> 12:01.879
I know it's hard...

12:03.020 --> 12:05.284
Seriously?

12:05.320 --> 12:06.958
That's your...?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.789
Well, it was good
talking to you.

12:16.930 --> 12:18.921
Have a good day, Jim.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.311
So, how are we with
the endorsement?

12:41.360 --> 12:42.486
Want me to polish it?

12:42.520 --> 12:43.953
No.

12:43.990 --> 12:45.787
But you're
fine with it?

12:45.830 --> 12:48.993
(sniffles)

12:49.030 --> 12:50.463
Who told us about him?

12:50.500 --> 12:52.024
Who told us about Finn?

12:52.070 --> 12:53.162
Yes.
I did.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.168
So you convinced Finn to run?

12:55.200 --> 12:57.202
No. I think
Alicia did.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.231
Why?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.903
Let's wait on the endorsement.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.542
W-Why?

13:04.580 --> 13:07.219
I just don't want
to make a big thing of it.

13:07.250 --> 13:10.014
Uh, Peter, just so you know,

13:10.050 --> 13:12.018
you have already endorsed him.

13:12.050 --> 13:13.017
You just haven't
appeared with him.

13:13.060 --> 13:16.848
Yeah, I know.
But let's hold off on it, okay?

13:16.890 --> 13:18.551
We got a problem.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.057
I know.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.125
Kael Pepper and my class action.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.128
We can only represent
one of 'em.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.491
Yes. The one that was
signed first. Kalinda.

13:26.530 --> 13:27.929
The class action...

13:27.970 --> 13:29.335
Geez, you-you pop
out of nowhere.

13:29.370 --> 13:32.009
_ The class action was
Signed yesterday at 3:00.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.576
You signed Kael
Pepper at 5:00.

13:33.610 --> 13:35.976
No, I signed him at 2:00.
I submitted it at 5:00.

13:36.010 --> 13:38.376
Kael Pepper only approached you
because of our suit.

13:38.410 --> 13:40.617
They want this to be
a conflict of interest.

13:40.650 --> 13:42.379
No, they approached us
because we're good lawyers,

13:42.420 --> 13:44.411
and they bring $8 million
in yearly business.

13:44.450 --> 13:46.418
Their facility polluted
the ground water.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.088
They poisoned those kids.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.348
That's debatable.
No, it isn't.

13:49.390 --> 13:51.051
Diane, if you represent
only the innocent,

13:51.090 --> 13:52.523
you'll go quickly
out of business.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.925
I got to get to court.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.622
Tell Kael Pepper thank you,
but no thank you.
You know, let's bring it

13:56.660 --> 13:57.763
to the executive committee.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.597
You pitch, I'll pitch,
and we'll let the firm decide.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.336
I got to go. Boo.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.101
Are you Jewish?

14:06.140 --> 14:08.506
Am I Jewish? Yeah. Why?

14:08.540 --> 14:11.407
I need you
to sit second chair.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.418
On what?

14:13.450 --> 14:15.441
Do you care?

14:16.650 --> 14:19.380
The voir dire process is
a very important one,

14:19.420 --> 14:20.978
because it enables the court

14:21.020 --> 14:23.079
and the lawyers
to determine whether or not

14:23.130 --> 14:25.223
each of you would be
appropriate jurors

14:25.260 --> 14:26.955
for this particular case.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.092
Canning's right.

14:28.130 --> 14:29.995
This trial is_ over
in v0ir dire.

14:30.030 --> 14:31.258
You had in your
employment contract

14:31.300 --> 14:33.097
that we only need a
majority to prevail,

14:33.140 --> 14:34.630
so, we just
need seven.

14:34.670 --> 14:36.137
Whoever gets
the first seven jurors

14:36.170 --> 14:37.467
has the upper hand
in negotiations.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.102
CANNING: This isn't about
gomg to trial.

14:39.140 --> 14:40.300
This is about
getting seven jurors.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.672
It could be the difference
between a $200,000 settlement

14:44.110 --> 14:45.475
What do I do?

14:46.510 --> 14:50.219
Look wise, and...

14:50.250 --> 14:53.617
every time I touch my nose,
you whisper in my ear.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.311
PARKS: Very well, then.
Let's begin.

14:56.360 --> 15:00.091
CANNING: _
Ms. Economus, in your capaCIty
as a human resources manager,

15:00.130 --> 15:02.155
do you have access
to what other people make?

15:02.200 --> 15:03.121
I mean, salary?

15:03.170 --> 15:04.569
Yes, I do.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.158
And does it rankle you
sometimes

15:06.200 --> 15:09.328
how_much more executives
get paid than other employees?

15:09.370 --> 15:11.406
The CEO of your company,
for example. How much more

15:11.440 --> 15:13.374
does that person make
than the average, say,

15:13.410 --> 15:16.174
claims adjuster?
I mean, 500 times?

15:16.210 --> 15:18.075
Your Honor, objection.

15:18.110 --> 15:20.146
Your Honor, I believe
Mr. Canning is trying

15:20.180 --> 15:21.670
to prejudice our jury
against our client

15:21.720 --> 15:23.142
by using
out-of-court statements.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.215
Yes, Mr. Canning, I
saw the news coverage

15:25.250 --> 15:28.549
of Mr. Paisley's comments,
and I am inclined to agree.

15:28.590 --> 15:30.080
Your Honor, I'm merely
trying to determine

15:30.130 --> 15:31.483
whether this juror
can fairly judge a man

15:31.530 --> 15:33.157
who makes thousands
of times what she...

15:33.200 --> 15:35.156
Oh, so you're worried about
jurors being fair to our client?

15:35.200 --> 15:37.088
Okay. I'm ruling

15:37.130 --> 15:39.360
that any out-of-court statements
having to do with class

15:39.400 --> 15:42.198
or economic differences
are irrelevant.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.104
Now step back.

15:43.140 --> 15:45.267
Ms. Economus, how much
of a reader are you?

15:45.310 --> 15:47.403
Much of a reader?

15:47.440 --> 15:49.635
Well, I guess as much
as anybody else.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.500
Though I read a lot in college.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.177
Have you ever read
Diary of Anne Frank?

15:53.220 --> 15:54.175
Your Honor!
Objection!

15:54.220 --> 15:55.471
Mr. Canning,
I warned you

15:55.520 --> 15:57.511
not to continue with the
irrelevant questions.

15:57.550 --> 15:59.313
_ With irrelevant
economic questions, Your Honor.

15:59.350 --> 16:01.284
This was not...

16:05.360 --> 16:07.328
You sure?

16:07.360 --> 16:10.227
Yes, uh, Your Honor, we'd
like to amend our suit

16:11.530 --> 16:13.339
On what grounds?

16:13.370 --> 16:14.530
Mrs. Florrick, that's my job.

16:14.570 --> 16:16.595
My client, Mr. Musset,
has Jewish ancestry

16:16.640 --> 16:18.665
on his father's side.
Oh.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.302
And Mr. Paisley's
insensitive remarks last night

16:20.340 --> 16:21.637
about Anne Frank and her

16:21.680 --> 16:23.602
tragic ordeal serves
to illustrate the anti-Semitism.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.005
No, I don't believe this.
Your Honor?
No, no.

16:26.050 --> 16:28.109
Religious discrimination is
a recognized cause of action.

16:28.150 --> 16:29.242
You may think

16:29.280 --> 16:31.646
it's a facade, and I
may agree with you,

16:31.690 --> 16:33.282
but that's what a trial is for.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.685
Very well, Mr. Canning.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.551
You can ask your
questions after lunch.

16:36.590 --> 16:38.353
Nice work, Howard.

16:38.390 --> 16:40.199
You need to talk
to Paisley.

16:40.230 --> 16:41.652
I'm not going
to apologize.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.793
They're using it to
get the jury they want.

16:43.830 --> 16:44.967
Yes, but I told the truth.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.436
That being surrounded by
protestors was like Anne Frank?

16:48.470 --> 16:50.700
I was being hyperbolic.
Then apologize for that.

16:50.740 --> 16:51.638
No. Alicia,
you're trying

16:51.670 --> 16:55.071
to get me to apologize
for the Nazi reference

16:55.110 --> 16:57.374
so people will think I'm
apologizing for the whole thing.

16:57.410 --> 17:02.177
Mr. Paisley, you said that the
one percent were like Jews

17:02.220 --> 17:03.289
in Germany.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.039
No. I said Tom Perkins
made a good point.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.115
You know who _called me
this morning?

17:08.160 --> 17:10.128
Neil Gross from Chumhum.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.684
Said, "Thank you.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.051
It's about time
somebody told the truth."

17:14.100 --> 17:16.398
Mr. Paisley, can I
have you meet someone?

17:16.430 --> 17:17.795
It'll only take a minute.

17:17.830 --> 17:20.196
I'm not gonna
change my mind.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.764
Mr. Fishbein,
you can come on in.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.563
Where is this putz?

17:23.610 --> 17:26.738
Mr. Paisley, I would like
you to meet Mr. Fishbein.

17:26.770 --> 17:29.671
FISHBEIN:
So, you think you
have it the same

17:29.710 --> 17:31.803
as the Jews of
Na2i Germany?

17:31.850 --> 17:34.671
(phone buzzing)
I'm gonna let you two
talk for a minute.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.086
(phone beeps on)
ALICIA:
Hey, Finn. What's up?

17:37.120 --> 17:39.213
Hey. I was, uh,
just wondering if you knew

17:39.250 --> 17:40.649
why they were delaying
the announcement.

17:40.690 --> 17:43.181
No. Are we delaying
the announcement?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.084
My office just got
a call from Eli.

17:45.130 --> 17:45.858
Did something change?

17:45.890 --> 17:47.221
I don't... I don't know.

17:47.260 --> 17:48.420
Did you call Eli?

17:48.460 --> 17:49.791
Yes_. He's not
returning my calls.

17:49.830 --> 17:52.162
Okay, let me see
what I can find out.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.088
No, I think
it's just a temporary delay.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.493
You think?

17:55.540 --> 17:57.303
Yes. We're trying
to schedule it for another day.

17:57.340 --> 17:58.602
What's going on, Eli?

17:58.640 --> 17:59.834
(sighs)

17:59.870 --> 18:01.804
Peter won't sign off
on the speech.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.707
He asked me who brought Finn
to his attention-- you or me.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.978
I did.

18:06.010 --> 18:09.343
I know. Look, let me call you
back if I find out more, okay?

18:09.380 --> 18:13.487
(woman laughing,
crowd chatter)

18:13.520 --> 18:14.817
(woman and Peter laughing)

18:14.860 --> 18:16.213
Peter?

18:16.260 --> 18:17.579
Oh. Sorry.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.858
No, no, no, no, no,
it's fine.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.221
It's fine.
Come on in.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.148
Eli, do you know Lauren?

18:22.200 --> 18:23.519
She's one of
our interns.
I haven't had the pleasure.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.424
I get your coffee every
morning, Mr. Gold.

18:25.470 --> 18:28.598
Lauren has started
a blog. "Ex...

18:28.640 --> 18:29.766
Journalism Major"?

18:29.800 --> 18:30.903
"Journalism
Major in EXIle."

18:30.940 --> 18:32.635
PETER:
Ah. Anyway,
she was hoping

18:32.670 --> 18:34.206
to get an
interview with me.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.629
Just a human interest piece.
You know,

18:36.680 --> 18:38.545
like, what makes
you tick, all that.

18:38.580 --> 18:39.706
Yeah. I like it.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.547
So, let's put it
on the schedule.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.138
LAUREN:
Mm. Thank you,
Mr. Florrick.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.839
Governor Florrick.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.915
Governor Florrick.

18:46.950 --> 18:48.383
Thank you.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.184
Oh, by the way,

18:51.230 --> 18:52.458
don't worry.

18:52.490 --> 18:53.798
It's not too red.

18:53.830 --> 18:55.821
(laughs)

18:58.830 --> 19:00.832
What's not too red?

19:00.870 --> 19:02.929
Her lipstick.

19:02.970 --> 19:05.165
(crowd chatter)

19:09.880 --> 19:11.871
You can go,
you stay.

19:11.910 --> 19:13.411
What's your name?
Lauren.

19:13.450 --> 19:14.917
Take a step back.
What?

19:14.950 --> 19:17.214
Take one step back.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.616
You are now 50 feet_ from
the governor's office.

19:19.650 --> 19:21.914
Don't _ever cross
this line again.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.825
You are not to talk
to the governor.

19:23.860 --> 19:25.282
You're not to look
at the governor.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.581
If the governor talks to you,

19:26.630 --> 19:28.757
you will smile, nod, and say
you're needed in polling

19:28.800 --> 19:30.961
on the third floor.
I didn't do anything wrong.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.763
You asked him
if your lipstick was red enough.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.665
Just for future reference,
that's wrong.

19:34.700 --> 19:36.258
He complimented me on it.
Lauren,

19:36.300 --> 19:37.938
do you want your job?

19:37.970 --> 19:39.961
50 feet.

19:40.010 --> 19:41.932
This line. Get it?

19:41.980 --> 19:43.971
Yes.
Good.

19:44.010 --> 19:46.274
PAISLEY:
I just want

19:46.310 --> 19:48.244
to express my sincere regret

19:48.280 --> 19:50.783
for my unfortunate choice
of words yesterday.

19:50.820 --> 19:52.344
Good job. How'd you do it?

19:52.390 --> 19:54.654
Mr. Fishbein,
the Holocaust survivor.

19:54.690 --> 19:55.918
(laughs)

19:55.960 --> 19:57.052
...obviously comparing myself,

19:57.090 --> 20:01.925
or anyone to Anne Frank
was extreme and ill-considered,

20:01.960 --> 20:04.269
and_ I want to
apologize to anyone

20:04.300 --> 20:06.996
who may have been offended
by my insensitivity...

20:07.030 --> 20:09.760
Yup, Alicia got to him.
What?

20:09.800 --> 20:12.439
STEVEN LEWIS:
I understand
you've come on tonight

20:12.470 --> 20:13.698
after meeting
with a Holocaust survivor.

20:13.740 --> 20:17.642
Yes, and I will say that it
was an enlightening experience.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.602
But he understood
that these were the words

20:19.650 --> 20:23.814
of a self-educated man who was
struggling for a metaphor.

20:23.850 --> 20:24.987
That's all.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.112
Good, good.

20:26.150 --> 20:28.482
He also understood my
frustration with the protestors.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.385
No.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.920
You mean, the backlash
against the one percent.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.154
Is that what I am?

20:33.190 --> 20:35.624
I always thought I was a guy
just trying to make a living.

20:35.660 --> 20:36.854
Stop talking!

20:36.900 --> 20:39.460
And your "frustration," as you
put it, is with those who don't?

20:39.500 --> 20:40.831
Look, a man has to
pull his weight.

20:40.870 --> 20:42.360
This is America,

20:42.400 --> 20:43.469
and there's a reason

20:43.510 --> 20:45.034
for this being the greatest
country in the world.

20:45.070 --> 20:47.277
We reward winners.

20:47.310 --> 20:49.278
This is not Italy or Greece.

20:49.310 --> 20:51.449
We do not reward the lazy.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.914
Oh, dear God. Someone just
throw a blanket over him.

20:53.950 --> 20:56.418
Do we have any Greeks
or Italians on the jury?

20:56.450 --> 20:57.678
LEWIS:
So, what do you think
of Tom Perkins'

20:57.720 --> 21:00.382
suggestion that voting rights
should be tied to tax brackets?

21:00.420 --> 21:02.911
Well, I probably
shouldn't say this...

21:02.960 --> 21:04.382
Oh, say it, say it.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.990
...but I think there's
some merit to it.

21:07.030 --> 21:08.520
Well, we just lost

21:08.560 --> 21:09.925
juror number four...

21:09.960 --> 21:11.996
and juror number two...

21:12.030 --> 21:14.635
and possibly two others.
Want me to talk
to Paisley this time?

21:14.670 --> 21:16.433
Nqum

21:16.470 --> 21:17.903
(frustrated grunt)

21:17.940 --> 21:20.374
Don't babysit me, Eli.

21:20.410 --> 21:22.332
Don't...
I am an adult.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.541
IfI want Lauren
to avoid my office,

21:24.580 --> 21:25.979
I will tell her myself.

21:26.010 --> 21:28.615
Are we talking
about that intern?

21:28.650 --> 21:30.709
Yes, we're talking
about that intern.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.718
I will handle
my own life.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.651
I don't need you to be
making decisions for me.
Peter,

21:35.690 --> 21:37.681
you are a politician
with a reputation.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.322
You can either put that

21:39.360 --> 21:41.351
behind you or...
I will not be...

21:43.670 --> 21:45.365
(sighs quietly)

21:45.400 --> 21:47.766
(quietly):
I will not be contained
in a bubble.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.439
I have to be with people;
that's who I am.

21:50.470 --> 21:51.801
Okay, if this were
a normal conversation,

21:51.840 --> 21:53.933
I would now make fun of you
for saying that

21:53.980 --> 21:55.971
"Lauren the intern" is people.

21:56.010 --> 21:58.672
'Cause I can find you
people in the supermarket
or the Shop 'n Save.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.610
But this doesn't seem_to be
a normal conversation,

22:00.650 --> 22:02.618
so what the hell's going on?
Nothing's going on.

22:02.650 --> 22:04.743
I'm just tired
of being cooped up.

22:04.790 --> 22:06.849
So plan your vacation
with Alicia.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.687
No.
Oh, come on, Peter,
you deserve it.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.585
Let me call her.
No. No.

22:10.630 --> 22:11.927
Please.
Why not?

22:11.960 --> 22:13.427
Well,

22:13.460 --> 22:15.018
Alicia and I...

22:16.760 --> 22:18.489
Ah...

22:18.530 --> 22:20.327
Peter... Peter...
It's okay.

22:21.770 --> 22:23.761
(door closes)

22:28.540 --> 22:29.802
(beeps)

22:32.410 --> 22:33.718
Alicia.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.742
Do you have time to talk
for a minute?

22:36.780 --> 22:39.112
No, I-I'm coming over.

22:47.460 --> 22:50.054
ZACH: Mom, do we really have
to do this right now?
Come on, it'll only

22:50.100 --> 22:52.489
take five minutes.
Come on, your grandma
wants a picture of you.

22:52.530 --> 22:56.466
(doorbell rings)
I'll get it.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.468
Oh, it's probably Eli.

22:58.510 --> 22:59.465
ZACH: Great. More people
to come make fun of me.

22:59.510 --> 23:01.978
Hey. Mom's in here.

23:02.010 --> 23:03.648
(gasps)

23:05.450 --> 23:07.042
You look great.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.172
All right, that's enough.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.688
(laughs):
No, no, no. I need a
picture. Over here.

23:10.720 --> 23:11.789
Come over here.

23:11.820 --> 23:14.118
What's up, Eli?
Nothing much.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.752
Just need
a few minutes.

23:15.790 --> 23:17.485
Zach. Grace.
Hi.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.827
You sound so formal.

23:18.860 --> 23:21.499
No. I'm just...
Be happy.

23:21.530 --> 23:22.656
Be happy.

23:22.700 --> 23:23.997
Watching
a family...

23:24.030 --> 23:25.429
(squeals)

23:25.470 --> 23:27.563
(laughing)
...be a family.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.795
Okay, okay.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.058
Wait up, wait up.

23:32.110 --> 23:34.476
Want some?
Uh, n-no.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.418
So, what do we
need to discuss
away from the kids?

23:45.890 --> 23:47.517
Peter and you.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.050
Okay.

23:49.090 --> 23:51.957
Shoot
What's going on
with Peter and you?

23:51.990 --> 23:53.548
Why?

23:53.600 --> 23:56.751
Because I get the sense that
there's something going on.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.893
Did Peter say something?

23:58.930 --> 24:00.534
No. Peter specifically

24:00.570 --> 24:03.630
did not say something.
Then why are you asking?

24:04.270 --> 24:06.204
Because I care.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.878
What? I do care.

24:10.910 --> 24:13.515
Even if only on the
most cynical level,

24:13.550 --> 24:16.542
but I want Peter
to stay in office.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.445
Then ask Peter.

24:20.890 --> 24:23.552
Is this about Will dying?

24:24.590 --> 24:27.127
This is about everything.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.651
(long sigh)

24:30.670 --> 24:32.626
I'm just tired, Eli.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.638
I'm just done.

24:34.670 --> 24:36.638
You're getting a divorce?
No.

24:36.670 --> 24:38.501
Then what?

24:38.540 --> 24:41.930
(sighs) We're staying together,
butthatsit

24:41.980 --> 24:43.607
Whatever Peter does...

24:43.650 --> 24:45.948
(whispers): I don't want
the kids to find out.

24:45.980 --> 24:47.868
Oh, my... God.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.148
I can't_believe...
This is crazy.

24:49.180 --> 24:52.217
I have to go hem a robe.
It was good seeing you, Eli.
Alicia,

24:52.250 --> 24:54.059
you're hurting-- that's all.

24:54.090 --> 24:56.650
I've been watching you
over the last year with Peter.

24:56.690 --> 24:57.827
You love him.

24:59.590 --> 25:02.855
And if you don't, he loves you.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.530
(laughs softly)

25:13.070 --> 25:16.107
DAVID:
Not buying what
you're selling, Nate.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.641
Uh-huh.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.012
Well, fine.
Just make it fast.

25:22.680 --> 25:23.749
You need me?
What's he offering you?

25:23.790 --> 25:26.588
_ Who? _
Canning. To vote his way
against my class action.

25:26.620 --> 25:28.588
Nothing. We share
a philosophy, that's all.

25:28.620 --> 25:32.078
Money trumps everything?
Well, it is why we're
in business, isn't it?

25:32.130 --> 25:34.519
Fine. Two words:
Rayna Hecht.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.661
The rainmaker?

25:38.700 --> 25:40.668
She brought me
this class action.

25:40.700 --> 25:42.065
It's important to her.

25:42.100 --> 25:44.068
Important enough
to bring her here?

25:44.110 --> 25:47.978
She told me she's finding life
with Tascioni a bit, uh...

25:48.010 --> 25:49.637
too constricting.

25:49.680 --> 25:52.148
And you can deliver?
I'm giving my
final presentation

25:52.180 --> 25:53.943
to the executive
committee in two days.

25:53.980 --> 25:56.175
Rayna will present as well.
Well, if it's true,

25:56.220 --> 25:58.916
CANNING: Your Honor,
we have no objections
I'm all yours.

25:58.950 --> 26:01.157
to seating Mr. Rizzardi--
he seems like he'd make

26:01.190 --> 26:02.885
a great juror.
Your Honor,
we'd like

26:02.920 --> 26:05.229
to exercise one of our
peremptory challenges.

26:05.260 --> 26:06.727
For what? Why?
What's wrong with him?

26:06.760 --> 26:08.648
Nothing's wrong with him.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.089
That's why we're exercising
our peremptory challenge.

26:11.130 --> 26:12.722
It's because he's
Italian, isn't it?

26:12.770 --> 26:14.260
It is our right...

26:14.300 --> 26:16.837
(several speaking at once)
JUDGE:
That's enough!

26:16.870 --> 26:19.759
Mr. Rizzardi,
you're excused.

26:19.810 --> 26:22.677
He's still up
by two jurors.

26:22.710 --> 26:25.201
Unless we can
disqualify one.

26:26.650 --> 26:27.844
Your Honor,

26:27.880 --> 26:28.949
may we approach again?

26:28.980 --> 26:30.880
Faster the better.
Come on.

26:33.190 --> 26:36.387
Your Honor, my apologies,
but I believe that

26:36.420 --> 26:38.149
one of Mr. Canning's...
I mean,

26:38.190 --> 26:40.624
one of the jurors that's
already been seated
may have been biased

26:40.660 --> 26:42.719
by my client's most
recent comments.
Your Honor,
this is outrageous.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.193
We've already agreed
on each one of these jurors.

26:44.230 --> 26:45.720
Outrageous, we say.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.362
CARY:
Yes, Your Honor, but if

26:47.400 --> 26:48.765
a statement
has been made

26:48.800 --> 26:50.097
in the press
that would render

26:50.140 --> 26:53.632
one of them incapable of
being fair and unbiased,
well, it's like

26:53.680 --> 26:55.875
Mr. Canning said: we
all want a fair jury.

26:55.910 --> 26:58.208
So, Ms. Economus,
you heard my client

26:58.250 --> 27:00.878
Mr. Paisley's
latest comments?
No.

27:00.920 --> 27:04.185
I mean, I didn't hear them
directly-- a girlfriend of mine

27:04.220 --> 27:06.780
mentioned something
about it.
I see. So,

27:06.820 --> 27:09.050
as a Greek person,
how did you feel

27:09.090 --> 27:11.320
about his comments about
Greece as a country?

27:11.360 --> 27:13.157
This is ridiculous.
I'm from Skokie.

27:13.190 --> 27:15.795
Yes, but your
heritage is
Greek, isn't it?

27:15.830 --> 27:18.025
Well, sure. Both sides.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.924
So, uh, you must
have been offended

27:19.970 --> 27:23.804
when Mr. Paisley said that if
America starts rewarding losers

27:23.840 --> 27:27.162
instead of winners,
we'll end up like Greece.

27:27.210 --> 27:30.304
Uh, y-you know,
now that you mention it, yeah,

27:30.340 --> 27:32.342
it was very
offensive.

27:32.380 --> 27:34.678
ELI:
You have an agreement?

27:34.720 --> 27:36.813
You and Alicia?

27:36.850 --> 27:38.841
You talked with my wife?

27:38.890 --> 27:41.688
I did. That's
why the intern?

27:41.720 --> 27:44.280
Eli, I don't pry
into your life.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.184
I don't have a life;
your life is my life.
Well,

27:46.230 --> 27:47.993
then let me live.

27:48.030 --> 27:49.725
So no divorce?

27:49.760 --> 27:51.318
And you and Alicia
can do whatever you want

27:51.370 --> 27:52.723
as long as no one knows?

27:52.770 --> 27:55.295
Is that what she told you?

27:55.340 --> 27:57.763
Just so you know, Peter,
I have worked before

27:57.810 --> 27:59.437
with politicians
who have made arrangements

27:59.470 --> 28:02.132
to keep their extramarital
activities from becoming public.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.705
It doesn't work;
it will always come out.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.479
Doesn't matter who--
an intern,

28:06.510 --> 28:09.411
a donor, your biggest fan...

28:09.450 --> 28:11.281
they all want to talk.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.810
They'll promise not to,

28:12.850 --> 28:14.488
but they will... talk.

28:14.520 --> 28:15.782
Yeah.

28:17.090 --> 28:19.752
And sometimes things come out
when they don't talk.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.361
Where'd this come from?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.298
What was that, Peter?

28:29.170 --> 28:31.161
Let's not discuss it.

28:32.940 --> 28:35.329
We've got work to do.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.439
Ah, Alicia.

28:37.480 --> 28:40.142
Do you have some Greeks and
Italians for me to meet?

28:40.180 --> 28:41.772
You're going
to issue a statement

28:41.820 --> 28:44.311
saying that you're giving
a million dollars to charity,

28:44.350 --> 28:46.739
and that you do not believe
voting should be

28:46.790 --> 28:50.317
tied with a person's
tax bracket.
What if I don't
believe that?

28:50.360 --> 28:53.249
You think I should have
less of a vote than you?

28:53.290 --> 28:56.498
Well, I don't know;
how much do you make?
Mr. Paisley, I know you.

28:56.530 --> 28:59.863
I know you like
to think of yourself
as blunt and direct.

28:59.900 --> 29:02.994
But this isn't
just blunt.
No, you don't know me.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.167
You think this
is hubris.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.906
I built a business from nothing.

29:07.940 --> 29:10.909
In '99, I lost it
in the tech bust.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.201
And I built it up again.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.308
From nothing.

29:13.350 --> 29:14.942
You're not poor now,
Mr. Paisley.

29:14.980 --> 29:16.242
(laughs)
Neither are you.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.918
I've seen your bills.

29:17.950 --> 29:19.884
You may choose
to disguise it

29:19.920 --> 29:21.854
in all these earthy
surroundings, but...

29:21.890 --> 29:25.189
you are the one percent.

29:26.430 --> 29:28.898
Did you know my
company is developing

29:28.930 --> 29:32.093
a gene that will
prolong a person's life?

29:32.130 --> 29:33.893
We are.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.158
The one percent.
Then what are you
worried about?

29:36.200 --> 29:37.497
You're winning.

29:37.540 --> 29:39.929
You have a lot of things,
Mr. Paisley--

29:39.970 --> 29:41.938
why do you feel
so cornered?

29:41.980 --> 29:45.177
Because there are more people
who want than people who have.

29:45.210 --> 29:46.575
Read Ayn Rand.

29:46.610 --> 29:47.872
Oh, dear God.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.478
Have you read her books?
They're awful.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.839
Well, they
weren't meant

29:50.890 --> 29:51.914
to be Moby-Dick,

29:51.950 --> 29:53.315
they were meant
to make you think.

29:53.350 --> 29:56.057
A guy bombs a building,
the rich go out on strike--

29:56.090 --> 29:58.923
i-it's a 12-year-old's
view of the world.

29:58.960 --> 30:02.123
It's like basing your philosophy
on the books of John Grisham.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.889
You should reread them.

30:03.930 --> 30:04.919
Mr. Paisley,

30:04.970 --> 30:06.597
you've always told me
that you are

30:06.630 --> 30:08.461
a bottom-line
kind of guy.
I am.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.139
So here's the bottom line.
We're losmg jury members.

30:11.170 --> 30:12.967
And the fund managers
are getting nervous.

30:13.010 --> 30:13.704
If it continues,

30:13.740 --> 30:16.607
they may not support
this merger.

30:16.640 --> 30:20.076
And what's worse,
you're in a media death spiral.

30:20.110 --> 30:23.216
No matter what you say,
you will never get
a fair interpretation.

30:23.250 --> 30:25.616
You have to put out
a statement.
Another apology.

30:25.650 --> 30:27.914
No. A statement.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.087
We'll hire a PR firm,

30:30.120 --> 30:32.122
using a focus group
to find the right words.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.424
As long as I don't have
to answer questions again.

30:34.460 --> 30:36.098
You won't.

30:36.130 --> 30:39.065
PAISLEY: And as long
as you do it for me.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.962
I'll be right back.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.537
We're seeing a lot
of each other, Eli.

30:45.570 --> 30:48.175
Are you sleeping
with Finn Polmar?

30:58.320 --> 31:00.413
Ask me another question.

31:00.450 --> 31:02.088
I don't have any
other questions.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.088
Then go to hell.

31:07.330 --> 31:10.629
There is a photo of Finn
leaving your apartment.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.218
Where?

31:12.270 --> 31:14.090
Outside your apartment.
No.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.028
Where's the photo?

31:16.070 --> 31:18.209
Peter had it.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.367
Now, I have some
worries here.

31:20.410 --> 31:22.401
Peter, you, Finn.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.374
The politics of all three.

31:24.410 --> 31:26.071
Castro.

31:26.110 --> 31:27.247
Yeah.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.578
This is the reply
we were waiting for.

31:29.620 --> 31:32.214
The state's attorney
did not send it to Finn.

31:32.250 --> 31:34.252
He sent it to Peter.

31:37.390 --> 31:39.358
(sighs)

31:39.390 --> 31:41.358
I did not sleep with Finn.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.925
He came to my apartment

31:43.970 --> 31:47.565
the morning of his appearance
before the Integrity Panel

31:47.600 --> 31:51.036
so we could get our strategy
lined up, that's all.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.236
I am sorry for asking.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.271
That's okay.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.414
We seem to share everything
these days.

32:02.450 --> 32:04.441
(laughs)

32:14.500 --> 32:16.320
(phone buzzing)

32:16.360 --> 32:18.726
(sighing)

32:18.770 --> 32:20.726
Don't.

32:20.770 --> 32:23.159
(sighs)

32:23.200 --> 32:25.168
I have to.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.166
Odd choice.

32:27.210 --> 32:28.529
(phone beeps on)

32:28.580 --> 32:31.071
Hello? Yes.

32:31.110 --> 32:32.646
(sighs)

32:32.680 --> 32:34.648
Yes, that's great.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.318
(sighs)

32:36.350 --> 32:38.318
Oh, 10:00 am. is fine.

32:38.350 --> 32:41.012
Okay. Thank you.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.517
Tell Ms. Hecht we're
looking forward to it.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.425
(phone beeps off)
Sorry.

32:45.460 --> 32:46.586
I can turn it off now.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.120
You're meeting with Rayna Hecht?

32:53.530 --> 32:57.034
Kalinda, we're not
doing this anymore.

32:59.710 --> 33:02.474
Hello. You've reached
the voice mail for Rayna Hecht.

33:02.510 --> 33:03.670
Please leave a message.

33:03.710 --> 33:05.746
(beep)
Rayna. Uh,
Diane Lockhart.

33:05.780 --> 33:08.647
I was expecting you
here at, uh, noon,

33:08.680 --> 33:10.341
and it's now 1:30.

33:10.380 --> 33:11.642
I hope nothing's wrong.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.579
Please call me.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.349
What time was her meeting
with Florrick-Agos?

33:16.390 --> 33:18.051
10:00 am.

33:18.090 --> 33:20.729
Thank you, Kalinda.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.728
She's _not
coming, is she?

33:25.770 --> 33:27.465
I don't know.

33:27.500 --> 33:28.762
Is she still in play?

33:29.600 --> 33:32.160
Diane?

33:32.210 --> 33:34.201
I understand.

33:35.210 --> 33:37.576
Let's get this over with.

33:39.610 --> 33:41.077
It's not what you think.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.371
You talked to Alicia?

33:42.420 --> 33:44.581
I did, and it is not
what you think.

33:44.620 --> 33:45.587
And what do I think?

33:45.620 --> 33:47.508
That Alicia's sleeping
with Finn. She's not.

33:47.550 --> 33:49.586
She represented him
during Castro's witch hunt,

33:49.620 --> 33:51.451
and on the day of his hearing,

33:51.490 --> 33:54.095
she was running late,
because she was...

33:54.130 --> 33:56.519
Mourning... Will.

33:56.560 --> 33:57.652
(sighs)

33:57.700 --> 33:59.725
Exhausted.

33:59.770 --> 34:02.694
So Finn went over there
to meet with her. That's all.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.731
Okay.

34:04.770 --> 34:06.658
Thanks.

34:06.710 --> 34:08.575
Peter...
No, no, no.

34:08.610 --> 34:11.602
Really, thanks.
I get it.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.516
Okay, and how many of you like
option number two?

34:17.550 --> 34:20.110
And we have
a Winner.

34:20.150 --> 34:21.811
Have you ever focus-grouped
an apology before?

34:21.860 --> 34:24.749
No. A marriage proposal once.

34:24.790 --> 34:25.620
Oh, you're kidding me.

34:25.660 --> 34:27.787
(laughing):
He was a comic book writer.

34:27.830 --> 34:29.593
He was terrible with women.
It was David Lee's idea.

34:29.630 --> 34:30.699
They liked number two.

34:30.730 --> 34:32.220
Oh, great, the one
he didn't like.

34:32.270 --> 34:34.693
He doesn't get to vote.
And, uh, two people

34:34.740 --> 34:36.389
suGlgested "backed into a corner"

34:36.440 --> 34:37.668
instead of pushed.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.803
No. "Pushed" is better.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.307
"Backed" is to passive.

34:40.340 --> 34:42.103
Okay, what's the
final version?

34:42.140 --> 34:44.199
Mm.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.571
"Anyone who knows me
knows I've have a tendency

34:46.610 --> 34:49.716
"to bristle when
pushed into a corner.

34:49.750 --> 34:52.810
I end up saying things
that I not only regret..."

34:52.850 --> 34:54.511
...but truly do not believe.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.255
My comments were thoughtless,

34:56.290 --> 34:58.656
and I'm sorry
ifI offended anyone.

34:58.690 --> 35:01.158
More to the point--
and I want to be clear--

35:01.200 --> 35:04.192
it's no one's fault
if they are poor.

35:04.230 --> 35:06.596
And you feel that was a sincere
apology, Mrs. Florrick?

35:06.630 --> 35:08.131
Yes, I do. I believe

35:08.170 --> 35:10.297
that Mr. Paisley's
feelings were summed up

35:10.340 --> 35:11.762
by the words
he spoke today.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.699
Words that he has lived
by his entire life.

35:14.740 --> 35:17.470
Not by the few sentences
he spoke two days ago.

35:17.510 --> 35:18.807
Well, you're a paid flack.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.670
Don't you have to say that?

35:20.710 --> 35:22.871
I'm his lavwer, Steve.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.741
Donald. I'm the other one.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.417
My apologies, Donald.

35:27.450 --> 35:31.728
In my own experience,
Mr. Paisley is a sincere man

35:31.760 --> 35:35.196
who spoke today
from his heart.

35:35.230 --> 35:36.697
But let's be honest.

35:36.730 --> 35:38.721
The poor aren't the only ones
he's disparaged.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.295
Isn't he being sued
for firing someone who's gay?

35:41.340 --> 35:42.534
That is not true, Don.

35:42.570 --> 35:44.800
Actually, this is Don.
Don Keats.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.604
Steven is the black guy
to my right.

35:47.640 --> 35:50.609
Um... my apologies.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.608
I don't have a monitor here.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.744
Why don't I just stop
using names?

35:55.780 --> 35:57.839
Sure. That's easiest for you.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.711
There_ wasn't a monitor
in the room!

35:59.750 --> 36:00.717
I couldn't see them!

36:00.750 --> 36:02.456
You don't have
to convmce me.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.879
Yeah, but they're making me
out to look like a racist.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.625
(phone rings, sighs)

36:06.660 --> 36:08.218
(Paisley laughing)
Hello.

36:08.260 --> 36:09.750
Oh, boy. (laughing continues)

36:09.800 --> 36:11.791
Mr. Paisley?

36:11.830 --> 36:13.821
I think you should be

36:13.870 --> 36:16.532
working up an apology, Alicia.

36:16.570 --> 36:18.265
(laughing)

36:18.310 --> 36:19.834
Thank you, Ms. Bouchard.

36:19.870 --> 36:21.428
Your Honor,
we're fine with this juror.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.607
Ms. Bouchard, you
are empanelled.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.801
And that, amazingly,

36:25.850 --> 36:27.772
completes our
selection process.

36:27.810 --> 36:28.970
We'll take a short recess.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.840
(gavelbangs)
Thank you.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.916
Okay, she puts us over
the top seven to five.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.487
Uh, I don't think so.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.219
Well, I'm afraid by my count,
that makes us deadlocked.

36:42.260 --> 36:43.852
Six-six.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.491
What do you propose,
Mr. Canning?

36:47.530 --> 36:48.929
$5 million.

36:48.970 --> 36:51.632
I think Mr. Paisley will
find it cheap in the long run.

37:02.980 --> 37:04.789
Hey, have you seen the news?

37:04.820 --> 37:05.946
Oh, God, what now?

37:05.990 --> 37:07.981
No, no, no, it's good.

37:10.490 --> 37:12.526
REPORTER:
The state attorney
general's office today

37:12.560 --> 37:14.858
expanded its
pharmaceutical investigation

37:14.900 --> 37:17.460
to include _
Kael Pepper Laboratories,

37:17.500 --> 37:19.468
a multinational company
that's been accused

37:19.500 --> 37:21.593
of price gouging patients
in the distribution

37:21.640 --> 37:23.665
of their AIDS medication
Reyacept.
What-what am I supposed to see?

37:23.700 --> 37:24.769
Just watch.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.903
No comment, no comment.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.636
Thank you.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.944
(laughs)
Oh, that's good.

37:31.980 --> 37:34.039
CANNING: Very clever,
but it's not gonna work.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.479
What won't?

37:35.520 --> 37:36.839
Juror number seven.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.438
You think because he's gay

37:38.490 --> 37:40.811
he'll hate that I represent
a firm that was accused

37:40.850 --> 37:42.818
of price gouging
AIDS medication,

37:42.860 --> 37:44.589
but you forget
he occupied Wall Street

37:44.630 --> 37:45.881
for six straight weeks.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.398
He slept in a cardboard box
on the sidewalk,

37:48.430 --> 37:50.352
and that's what
he cares about.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.958
He's gay.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.160
Hmm, I didn't know that.

37:53.200 --> 37:56.328
That's not the juror you should
worry about, Mr. Canning.

37:56.370 --> 37:57.837
It's juror number five,

37:57.870 --> 37:59.599
Joanne Honig.

37:59.640 --> 38:00.834
You don't remember?

38:00.870 --> 38:02.838
Her son died last year.

38:02.880 --> 38:03.972
AIDS.

38:04.010 --> 38:05.375
It's a tragedy.

38:08.920 --> 38:09.909
$2 million.

38:09.950 --> 38:11.417
$500,000.

38:11.450 --> 38:12.883
$1 million and it's a drop
in the bucket.

38:12.920 --> 38:15.059
And besides,
none of us knows for sure

38:15.090 --> 38:18.685
what any of these jurors
are gonna do anyway, do we?

38:24.670 --> 38:26.797
It's a deal, Mr. Canning,
but stick to it this time.

38:29.670 --> 38:31.558
Diane,

38:31.610 --> 38:32.963
I'm sorry.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.739
_ I don't think
it's gonna work out.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.668
I don't understand.

38:37.710 --> 38:40.099
I have concerns.

38:40.150 --> 38:41.845
What concerns?

38:41.880 --> 38:44.713
Just things I'm hearing.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.718
Such as?

38:46.750 --> 38:49.059
Such as...

38:49.090 --> 38:51.354
that you're having trouble
putting Will's death behind you.

38:51.390 --> 38:53.950
That you're stepping away
from the day-to-day management

38:53.990 --> 38:54.991
of the firm.

38:55.030 --> 38:56.429
You're losing clients.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.552
None of that is true.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.921
(sighs)
Lyle Pollard?

39:01.940 --> 39:04.761
I withdrew from that case
to avoid suborning perjury.

39:04.810 --> 39:05.868
You would've done the same,

39:05.910 --> 39:06.934
and where are you hearing
all of this?

39:06.970 --> 39:08.039
I'd rather not say.

39:08.070 --> 39:09.139
Was it Florrick-Agos?

39:09.180 --> 39:10.636
Is that where you're going?

39:10.680 --> 39:12.875
I don't know
where I'm going yet.

39:12.910 --> 39:14.673
I'm sorry.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.574
I wish it
could've worked out, Diane.

39:16.620 --> 39:19.009
I'd like you to keep
the class action.

39:19.050 --> 39:20.540
You don't understand.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.581
I've lost the class action.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.759
Without you,
I didn't have the votes.

39:24.790 --> 39:25.984
What votes?

39:26.030 --> 39:27.725
(sighs)

39:27.760 --> 39:29.625
It doesn't matter now.
(clears throat)

39:29.660 --> 39:32.094
If you would like,
I will, uh,

39:32.130 --> 39:33.062
help you find new counsel.

39:33.100 --> 39:36.069
Diane...

39:36.100 --> 39:37.431
I am sorry.

39:47.710 --> 39:49.678
Why'd you do it?

39:49.720 --> 39:51.415
Diane.

39:51.450 --> 39:52.917
Why did I...
What are we talking about?

39:52.950 --> 39:54.486
You want to make a
play for Rayna Hecht,

39:54.520 --> 39:56.750
by all means, have a meeting
and make your pitch,

39:56.790 --> 39:58.018
but to denigrate me,

39:58.060 --> 40:00.483
to spread lies about my
dedication to my firm!

40:00.530 --> 40:03.158
Diane!
We had a meeting
scheduled with Rayna.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.997
I mean, she was here, but
the meeting never happened.

40:05.030 --> 40:06.566
She left.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.665
She left?
Yes.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.736
She got a call from Canning,
and then she left.

40:11.770 --> 40:14.409
I just assumed that she made
up her mind to go with you.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.170
Canning poisoned the well

40:21.210 --> 40:23.110
at his own firm.

40:23.150 --> 40:24.219
So you're being
marginalized

40:24.250 --> 40:25.786
by the partnership
at Lockhart/Gardner?

40:25.820 --> 40:27.048
Well, I know what
that's like.

40:27.090 --> 40:28.114
Diane,

40:28.150 --> 40:30.152
if there's anything
we can do...

40:30.190 --> 40:32.158
Alicia, this is not our fight.

40:32.190 --> 40:33.680
Cary...
No.

40:33.730 --> 40:35.721
He's right.

40:36.730 --> 40:38.493
You're right.

40:38.530 --> 40:40.066
It's my fight.

40:48.110 --> 40:50.704
(sighs)

41:21.070 --> 41:22.879
(knocking)

41:22.910 --> 41:25.174
Not now, Eli.

41:25.210 --> 41:28.611
Do you need anything else, sir?
