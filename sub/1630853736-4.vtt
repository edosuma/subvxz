using different actors

04:27.517 --> 04:29.185
to portray each person,

05:19.610 --> 05:21.779
But I couldn't really see
their faces well

were arranged.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.336
(CLICKS TONGUE)

09:47.420 --> 09:48.963
NATHAN: But I now knew
that to take on the mind

09:49.046 --> 09:52.800
of a stranger, it wasn't enough
to just talk to them.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.678
The level of immersion
had to be deeper.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.764
I am in the process of arranging
for all of you

09:58.848 --> 10:02.852
to work in the actual jobs
of your primary.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.896
Or at least as-- as close
as we can get.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.983
-Is that cool, pretty...
-ACTORS: Yeah.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.818
...or is that dumb?

10:10.901 --> 10:14.155
-I don't wanna work.
-(ALL LAUGH)

10:15.740 --> 10:17.533
NATHAN: I was noticing
the more extreme

10:17.616 --> 10:18.909
my method became,

10:18.993 --> 10:21.662
the more these actors seemed
to respect me.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.248
If I'm not gonna go all the way
and get out of my comfort zone,

10:24.332 --> 10:27.209
how am I gonna know
where I can go?

10:27.293 --> 10:30.504
So, yeah, thank you for just
the space, you know.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.883
NATHAN: But when I caught up
with Thomas, something felt off.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.885
Yeah, so-- so how did it go?
Yeah, what happened?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.553
-THOMAS: It was--
-Did you get personal? Did you?

10:37.636 --> 10:40.306
Yeah. The deeper conversation
was hard to accomplish.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.600
Did you spill your bowl
or anything? Or...

10:42.683 --> 10:44.602
-Did not spill the bowl.
-NATHAN: Okay, yeah.

10:44.685 --> 10:48.272
But I instead went with, uh...

10:48.356 --> 10:50.649
telling him that I lost
my lucky guitar pick

10:50.733 --> 10:51.901
that I got from my dad.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.069
-Okay.
-And then--

10:53.152 --> 10:54.695
-Is that true?
-No, that was a lie.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.863
-Oh, okay, okay, got it.
-Yeah.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.656
I mean, I don't really
like lying to people,

10:57.740 --> 10:59.867
-in general.
-Yeah, neither do I.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.494
-THOMAS: Yeah.
-Yeah.

-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-(CHUCKLES)

11:04.288 --> 11:07.750
Yeah, I don't know. It's, uh,
it's weird, but...

11:07.833 --> 11:11.003
this is all so fascinating,
so what are you gonna do?

11:11.712 --> 11:12.546
Right.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.298
NATHAN:
Thomas's ambiguous emotions

11:14.382 --> 11:17.426
were hard for me to read,
but then I got the sense

11:17.510 --> 11:19.470
he had been uncomfortable
with this method

11:19.553 --> 11:21.263
since the very first day.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.807
So, yeah.
That's what makes me feel

11:22.890 --> 11:26.769
-kinda weird about it sometimes.
-About doing these-- this...

11:26.852 --> 11:29.772
...specific kind
of stalking thing. (CHUCKLES)

11:29.855 --> 11:31.107
The Fielder Method.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.151
NATHAN: Which was interesting
because I had not felt that

11:34.235 --> 11:35.444
when I was him.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.743
So rather than recreating
today's lesson,

11:42.827 --> 11:46.497
I decided to experience
that first day again

11:46.580 --> 11:48.916
to see
if I had missed something.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.418
-Hey, I'm Nathan.
-Thomas.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.837
-Thomas? Good to meet you.
-Yeah. Good to meet you.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.463
-Uh, yeah, have a seat.
-Sure, yeah.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.632
-And, uh, just hang out.
-Okay, great.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.551
NATHAN: This time, I was focused

11:58.634 --> 12:00.886
on really getting
into his mindset.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.973
So I just kept saying to myself
in my head,

12:04.056 --> 12:06.600
"Your name is Thomas
and you're an actor."

12:07.268 --> 12:08.602
"How do you feel?"

12:08.686 --> 12:11.605
I have a show that requires
a specific type

12:11.689 --> 12:14.650
-of performance.
-NATHAN: Almost immediately,

12:14.733 --> 12:18.446
I felt a rush of excitement come
over me when I remembered

12:18.529 --> 12:20.406
there were cameras filming me.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.367
HBO cameras.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.953
I love being on camera.

12:26.036 --> 12:30.249
But I wanted to play it cool,
like I didn't care that much.

12:30.332 --> 12:33.377
With this show, if your per--
if your performance

12:33.461 --> 12:34.587
isn't accurate...

12:35.880 --> 12:37.840
you could ruin someone's life.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.342
NATHAN: Wait, what is this show?

12:41.385 --> 12:43.929
Is this a show
about an acting class?

12:44.013 --> 12:48.309
Am I supposed to be acting?
Something doesn't make sense.

12:48.392 --> 12:51.061
If you're training actors
for a show,

12:51.145 --> 12:53.272
why would you be filming
the training?

12:54.356 --> 12:55.483
I wanted to ask,

12:55.566 --> 12:58.068
but I was worried
it would seem rude.

12:58.152 --> 13:03.157
I didn't wanna stand out.
I wanted to impress Nathan.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.367

to the first day

so excited to have you.

If you wanna participate
in the show,

13:24.553 --> 13:26.764
I don't know any
of these legal terms.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.268
This would take me hours
to read.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.020
Thank you so much.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.772
NATHAN: But everyone else
is signing it,

13:34.855 --> 13:36.941

13:37.024 --> 13:39.860
Uh, it's all standard.
Signature is on the fourth page.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.029
-NATHAN: Right. Sorry, yeah.
Okay.
-ASSISTANT: Yeah, no problem

13:42.112 --> 13:44.365
-Great, we'll see you tomorrow.
-Yeah.

13:44.448 --> 13:47.409
NATHAN: Reliving the day again
as Thomas made me realize

13:47.493 --> 13:49.828
there was a whole other layer
to his experience

13:49.912 --> 13:51.830
-I hadn't considered.
-ASSISTANT: Thank you so much.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.541
-Thanks again for today.
-Yeah. Thank you.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.209
I'll see you. Yeah.

13:55.292 --> 13:59.088
NATHAN: And I wondered
if was going far enough.

13:59.171 --> 14:04.885
♪ (MILD TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

14:04.969 --> 14:06.887
NATHAN: I had just sent
these actors off

14:06.971 --> 14:09.974
to work for an entire week
as someone else.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.061
But how much is enough?

14:16.021 --> 14:19.483
How do you ever know
you truly understand someone?

14:22.987 --> 14:27.616
So, I started visiting Thomas
working at the acai bowl place.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.493
-NATHAN: Hey!
-THOMAS: Hey! How you doing?

14:29.577 --> 14:30.578
Good. How are you?

14:30.661 --> 14:31.996
NATHAN: Going through
the exact experience

14:32.079 --> 14:33.789
he had with his primary.

14:33.872 --> 14:36.250
-How many siblings do you have?
-THOMAS: Pardon me?

14:36.333 --> 14:38.377
-How many siblings?
-THOMAS: Brother, two sisters.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.628
-Brother, two sisters?
-THOMAS: Yeah.

Do you want Nutella,
peanut butter, almond butter?

14:41.463 --> 14:43.757
NATHAN: And returned to class
the next morning

14:43.841 --> 14:45.801
to live the second day again.

14:45.884 --> 14:48.304
I'm a dog walker
for this dog walking app

14:48.387 --> 14:50.431
and my primary was this director

14:50.514 --> 14:52.808
and I-- I actually got
into his house.

14:52.891 --> 14:55.185
NATHAN: But this time,
it felt different.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.980
I think you're the first person
in the history of this project

14:58.063 --> 15:01.442
to actually get inside
their primary's home. Um...

15:01.525 --> 15:02.943
It's amazing. Wow!
(CHUCKLES)

15:03.027 --> 15:05.988
I think that deserves a round
of applause. Yeah.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.449
(ALL APPLAUD)

15:08.532 --> 15:10.784
NATHAN: And I began to question
the tactics

15:10.868 --> 15:13.120
this teacher was encouraging.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.497
You spill your bowl
on the counter and...

15:16.332 --> 15:17.916
see how he responds to that.

15:19.918 --> 15:22.171
NATHAN: But every night
when I went home,

15:22.254 --> 15:23.839
it was still my house.

15:24.923 --> 15:28.886
My marble coffee table. My TV.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.139
My black and white toilet.

15:32.222 --> 15:35.559
The illusion was shattered.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.729
So, I suggested to Thomas
that he move into an apartment

15:38.812 --> 15:40.481
that reflects
the living situation

15:40.564 --> 15:44.151
of his primary,
to immerse himself fully.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.612
Did you-- did you find out
his living situation?

15:46.695 --> 15:48.072
Yeah. I found out that he lives

15:48.155 --> 15:49.698
with the couple
of his bandmates,

15:49.782 --> 15:53.285
actually pretty close to here.
Uh, Sherman Oaks area.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.828
-Okay.
-THOMAS: Mm-hmm.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.664
Cool. Uh, how soon can you move?

15:56.747 --> 15:59.124
(CHUCKLES) As soon as I have to.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.377
NATHAN: So, I rented him
a similar place

16:01.460 --> 16:04.213
and hired two actors
to play his roommates.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.881
All right. So, this is, uh...

16:05.964 --> 16:07.174
-Tex and Matt.
-TEX: S'up man?

16:07.257 --> 16:08.550
-They'll be your new roommates.
-Hey.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.844
NATHAN: I told him
I would collect his mail for him

16:10.928 --> 16:13.222
and water his plants
while he was away.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.765
-(KEYS JANGLE)
-Plant in my bathroom.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.475
-Just a little bit.
-Okay.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.268
And be careful
'cause it'll overflow

-All right, sure. Great.

to do more than that.

was going deeper
