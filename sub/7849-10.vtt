MADDIE, I GOT YOU
THE GREATEST GIFT
IN THE WORLD,

19:07.967 --> 19:10.100
AND I INSIST
YOU OPEN IT RIGHT NOW.

19:10.100 --> 19:13.100
THIS PARTY MIGHT
BARELY HAVE A PULSE...

19:13.100 --> 19:15.100
HEY, IS THAT GUY
BREATHING?

19:15.100 --> 19:17.233
[SNORTS]

19:17.233 --> 19:18.567
OK, GOOD.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.300
BUT THIS PRESENT
WILL MAKE EVERYTHING
WORTHWHILE.

19:22.300 --> 19:23.934
OK.

19:25.300 --> 19:28.800
[GASP] WOW! IT'S
EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED,

19:28.800 --> 19:30.300
RIGHT DOWN
TO THE CINNAMON STICKS.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.033
OH, A CARD.

19:32.033 --> 19:34.734
CARD?

19:34.734 --> 19:36.834
"DEAR MADDIE,
ZACK DIDN'T BUY YOU THIS.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.500
I DID. LOVE, CODY."

19:38.500 --> 19:40.500
DANG.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.100
JUST LIKE HIM TO PUT
AN EXTRA CARD ON THE INSIDE.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.000
MADDIE, I'M SORRY.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.400
I WANTED TO GET YOU
THE BEST PRESENT EVER,

19:48.400 --> 19:50.934
BUT EVERYTHING
WAS TOO EXPENSIVE,

19:50.934 --> 19:52.300
AND THEY DON'T SELL
PUPPIES TO MINORS, SO--

19:52.300 --> 19:53.567
I LOVE YOUR PRESENT.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.367
BUT IT'S
NOT EVEN FROM ME.

19:55.367 --> 19:57.867
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE GIFT.

19:57.867 --> 19:59.734
YOU CAME TO MY PARTY,

19:59.734 --> 20:03.000
AND THAT'S THE
BEST PRESENT I COULD
HAVE EVER GOTTEN.

20:04.033 --> 20:05.500
WOMEN!

20:06.934 --> 20:08.600
WOMEN!

20:09.867 --> 20:11.133
[CAR DOORS
CLOSING

20:11.133 --> 20:13.300
OH, MORE GUESTS!

20:13.300 --> 20:16.567
LONDON? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

20:16.567 --> 20:18.400
I GOT LOCKED
OUT OF MY OWN PARTY.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.300
[GASP] I DON'T NEED
ANY I.D., DO I?

20:21.300 --> 20:22.300
NO.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.000
I'M SORRY
YOU GOT LOCKED OUT.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.934
ACTUALLY, I DON'T CARE.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.100
I WASN'T HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.200
NEITHER WAS I.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.367
AND TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH,

20:31.367 --> 20:34.100
THIS GUY'S THE LIFE
OF THE PARTY.

20:34.100 --> 20:38.100
MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN
MAKING MY LIFE MISERABLE
ALL NIGHT,

20:38.100 --> 20:39.367
AND THEY DON'T
EVEN SPEAK.

20:39.367 --> 20:42.767
YOU'RE LUCKY. I WISH
MY PARENTS DIDN'T SPEAK.

20:42.767 --> 20:44.100
AND THE WORST
PART OF IT IS,

20:44.100 --> 20:46.400
WE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO HAVE
A MISERABLE TIME TOGETHER!

20:46.400 --> 20:47.767
WELL, YOU'RE HERE NOW,

20:47.767 --> 20:50.133
AND THE NIGHT'S
STILL YOUNG,

20:50.133 --> 20:51.867
EVEN IF THE GUESTS
AREN'T.

20:51.867 --> 20:53.500
LET'S MAKE
THE BEST OF IT.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.800
YEAH. WE DON'T NEED
OTHER PEOPLE

20:55.800 --> 20:57.600
AND FANCY STUFF
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.200
WE CAN HAVE FUN,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.800
TOTALLY!

21:05.900 --> 21:07.834

WE'D SHOW UP.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.000
LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE'S
HAVING A GREAT TIME.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.200
EVEN LONDON AND HER DAD.

22:04.834 --> 22:07.700
SO YOU'RE NOT MAD
THAT I STOLE YOUR PRESENT?

22:07.700 --> 22:09.200
NAH. NOT IF YOU
DON'T MIND

22:09.200 --> 22:10.400
THAT I GAVE
YOUR GIFT BAG AWAY

22:10.400 --> 22:13.000
TO THAT CUTE MAID
FROM THE SEVENTH FLOOR.

22:13.967 --> 22:15.100
HA HA!

22:15.100 --> 22:19.200
AND ODDLY,
I'M OK WITH THAT.
