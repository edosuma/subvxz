WEBVTT

01:11.138 --> 01:13.172
Show 'em!
Wash them dishes, punk.

01:14.225 --> 01:15.507
Back already, baby boy?

01:16.477 --> 01:18.543
What you need?
That molly.

01:18.646 --> 01:19.595
Only five again?

01:19.680 --> 01:21.430
Nah. 25.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.514
Upping your game, son?

01:22.600 --> 01:23.849
You know how it is.

01:23.934 --> 01:25.250
I'm just trying to get paid.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.902
Yeah, say less. We got you.

01:27.021 --> 01:28.403
♪ I'm a dealer, and I'm known ♪

01:28.522 --> 01:31.573
♪ to pull up on them
dealer tags... ♪

01:31.692 --> 01:32.658
(thud)
(man screaming)

01:32.760 --> 01:33.742
where you at?
Hey, give me that.

01:33.861 --> 01:34.910
Man. Hey, get him.

01:35.029 --> 01:36.411
Put your hands down.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.063
Get your ass back...
Devon:
That's what happens

01:38.165 --> 01:40.398
when you steal
from lamar starks.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.501
But if you really
trying to get paid,

01:42.603 --> 01:43.735
fall through
tomorrow, all right?

01:43.838 --> 01:44.953
I got some people
I want you to meet.

01:45.039 --> 01:46.789
A'ight. Bet.
A'ight?

01:46.907 --> 01:48.907
(man grunting)

01:49.009 --> 01:50.876
you ain't nothing
right now, huh?

01:50.961 --> 01:53.745
(shouting)

01:54.748 --> 01:55.881
<i> (door closes)</i>

01:56.967 --> 01:58.934
boy, where the hell you been?

01:59.053 --> 02:00.102
I had some stuff
to take care of.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.303
Stuff like what?

02:01.388 --> 02:02.437
You were supposed to take me
to the market.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.606
What's going on with you?
One minute,

02:04.725 --> 02:05.924
everything's fine,
the next minute,

02:06.026 --> 02:07.860
you're sneaking around,
acting all strange.

02:07.945 --> 02:10.312
Everything's fine, ma. Really.

02:11.282 --> 02:13.265
What's in the bag?

02:13.367 --> 02:15.784
(scoffs)
you done lost your damn mind.

02:15.870 --> 02:16.768
Sorry.
(phone chimes)

02:16.871 --> 02:18.937
I got to go.
Where are you going?

02:19.039 --> 02:20.939
You just got here.
I'll see you later.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.241
(door opens)
come back here, malik.

02:22.326 --> 02:24.626
(door closes)
malik!

02:29.016 --> 02:30.048
(footsteps approaching)

02:30.151 --> 02:32.134
please, don't even bother.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.802
I read it online already.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.387
Sounds like they

02:35.472 --> 02:37.322
still have no idea
who you are.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.641
Yeah, and I want
to keep it that way.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.977
Those rolls. Mmm.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.563
They smell like some
of my sweetest memories.

02:44.648 --> 02:46.515
Grandma's recipe.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.301
She used to make it
for your dad and I

02:49.403 --> 02:50.969
when we were little.
(chuckles)
yeah.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.471
I remember he used to light up
every time he talked about them.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.358
Thought maybe they could help
delilah get through her day.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.343
Mm.
(footsteps approaching)

02:58.445 --> 03:00.696
you set?
Uh, yeah.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.247
I just...

03:02.333 --> 03:04.333
Hope I don't start crying
talking about jason

03:04.451 --> 03:06.668
in front of the whole school.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.338
Keep thinking about his laugh.
(chuckles softly)

03:09.456 --> 03:12.591
that was the last thing I heard
before the gunfire started.

03:12.676 --> 03:15.761
No shame
in how you feel, baby.

03:15.846 --> 03:17.212
Yeah,
that's what memorials are for.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.715
To share your feelings.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.883
Celebrate the ones you love

03:20.968 --> 03:22.801
by keeping them alive
in your heart.

03:24.221 --> 03:25.837
(whispers):
Yeah.

03:25.940 --> 03:29.524
Like how every time you make
these cinnamon rolls, aunt vi,

03:29.643 --> 03:30.859
they remind you of
your mom's kitchen?

03:30.978 --> 03:32.544
Yep.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.530
So, when you're up
on that stage today--

03:35.649 --> 03:38.650
ooh-- talking about jason,

03:38.702 --> 03:42.454
you just remember
that your great-gran, your aunt

03:42.539 --> 03:44.122
and your mother

03:44.208 --> 03:46.158
are right there with you.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.412
(breathes deeply)
can we go?

03:50.497 --> 03:52.530
I want to get there early.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.698
Yeah, let's do it.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.534
Got somewhere I got to be,
anyway.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.837
Don't touch my
rolls. Go on. Go on.

03:58.939 --> 04:02.257
(chuckles)

04:02.343 --> 04:05.410
celia:
Malik's a senior this year.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.562
He's got a district
science scholarship to college.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.064
Handsome young man.

04:09.183 --> 04:11.316
Wish the world still
saw him as young.

04:11.402 --> 04:14.552
(sighs) he's at that age,
what they see is a threat.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.488
How can I help?

04:16.573 --> 04:18.824
He's always been
a good kid.

04:18.909 --> 04:21.326
Never been in trouble
a day in his life.

04:21.412 --> 04:23.395
But something's up with him.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.280
He's keeping odd hours.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.899
Jumps when his phone rings.

04:28.002 --> 04:30.786
He's never kept a secret
from me ever.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.254
But now...

04:32.373 --> 04:34.106
You're worried
the streets got him.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.424
(voice breaking):
I lost his father.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.426
I don't want to lose him.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.094
I know

04:39.213 --> 04:42.547
this may seem like a small thing
to someone like you, but...

04:43.550 --> 04:45.050
It's not small to you.

04:46.603 --> 04:48.470
That's your boy.

04:50.441 --> 04:52.975
I'll see what I can do to help.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.827
Does malik have a cell phone?

04:55.896 --> 04:57.562
Appreciate the difficult
position this puts you in.

04:57.648 --> 05:00.983
Tracking people like her is
supposed to be your specialty,

05:01.068 --> 05:03.602
but all I'm hearing
are excuses.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.805
So, you say you appreciate the
position you're putting me in?

05:06.907 --> 05:08.974
Then do something about it.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.242
Detective.

05:11.295 --> 05:13.879
Little coffee
with your ass chewing?

05:13.964 --> 05:15.447
This wouldn't happen to do
with that article

05:15.549 --> 05:16.781
that dropped this morning?

05:16.884 --> 05:18.383
I don't get you, dante.

05:18.469 --> 05:19.551
That kind of press,

05:19.636 --> 05:22.787
a vigilante
making reckless choices

05:22.890 --> 05:24.673
and endangering the public,

05:24.758 --> 05:27.509
makes us all look bad.
You especially.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.961
So why are you okay
with it?
Who said I was?

05:30.064 --> 05:32.097
You. When you let her slip

05:32.199 --> 05:34.182
through your fingers.
You haven't even gotten a whiff.

05:34.268 --> 05:36.201
Mallory:
I've only been on it a minute.

05:36.270 --> 05:38.987
But I did figure out
why you came up short.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.939
Do tell.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.825
You don't chase someone
whose whole m.O. Is hiding.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.994
You chase the folks
she's mixed up with.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.946
They're gonna lead me
right to her.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.815
Seem pretty sure of yourself.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.534
Don't take it personally.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.986
Hunting big game,
it's not always easy

05:55.089 --> 05:56.671
to know which weapon to use.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.853
Robyn:
Hey, malik?

06:11.972 --> 06:14.139
Malik.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.707
Hey. Hey, malik.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.025
Malik. Malik!

06:17.144 --> 06:18.527
Listen,
I just want to talk.

06:18.645 --> 06:21.113
(tires screech)

06:21.198 --> 06:22.280
hey! Hey,

06:22.383 --> 06:23.648
what are you doing? Stop!
Come on.

06:23.734 --> 06:24.750
Let's go.

06:31.408 --> 06:33.041
(clippers buzz)

06:33.994 --> 06:35.877
oh, yeah.
Harry:
Yeah?

06:35.996 --> 06:38.997
Yeah.
Feel cold air circulating
around my ears.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.565
You said

06:40.667 --> 06:43.168
you were tired of
looking like a caveman.
No, I know.

06:43.253 --> 06:46.538
I just, you know...
No, it's good. You know,

06:46.640 --> 06:48.807
I want to make sure it was nice
and tight. You know, if I...

06:48.892 --> 06:50.542
I can go in tighter
if you want.
No, I'm good.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.644
(phone ringing)

06:52.729 --> 06:54.930
oh, lookee here.
(exhales)

06:56.517 --> 06:59.101
well, if it isn't
our mysterious vigilante.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.786
(clears throat)
I like the picture.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.954
Not sure I ever noticed the big
question mark on your face.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.606
Look, you can give me
a hard time later.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.741
My client's kid
just got abducted.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.577
Now, his mom said
he might be into drugs,

07:08.695 --> 07:10.112
but these didn't look
like drug dealers.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.329
I need you to run a plate
for me.

07:11.415 --> 07:12.531
All right, what do you got?

07:12.616 --> 07:16.418
Gray van. New york bnq-1925.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.069
(keys clack)
it's registered

07:18.172 --> 07:20.738
to mike skocroft.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.340
Who's mike skocroft?
Mel:
Whoa.

07:22.426 --> 07:24.292
Looks like someone
who doesn't exist.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.344
What do you mean?
Means the registration's a fake.

07:26.430 --> 07:28.513
Even the address
isn't a real address.

07:28.599 --> 07:30.132
Whoever owns this van

07:30.217 --> 07:32.384
really doesn't want anybody
to know who they are.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.719
What the hell is malik into?

07:35.722 --> 07:37.722
♪ ♪

07:45.916 --> 07:47.199
harry, what about tracking
malik's phone's gps?

07:47.317 --> 07:48.316
It's been turned off.

07:48.402 --> 07:49.818
Probably by the person
who grabbed him.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.537
I'm sorry, rob. Uh,
there's just not much I can do

07:52.656 --> 07:55.023
with a plate registered
to a fake name and address.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.875
Check the dmv file
for that plate.

07:56.994 --> 07:59.527
Maybe there's an alert flag
buried in its code.

07:59.630 --> 08:01.246
Matter of fact, there is.

08:01.331 --> 08:03.582
It's set to send an email
anytime anybody runs the plate.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.334
How'd you know that?
Where does the email go?

08:06.420 --> 08:09.504
New york field division. Dea.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.840
Ah, so the guys who snatched
malik were undercovers.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.509
That's why
the registration was fake.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.977
The dea's always notified

08:16.063 --> 08:17.429
whenever someone runs
their plates.

08:17.514 --> 08:19.648
Right, to let them know if
anyone's poking around their op.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.349
Don't worry. I was
really careful.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.101
What do undercovers want
with malik?

08:23.187 --> 08:25.987
Shoot me the address for
the nearest dea field office.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.657
Oh, and, harry,
I need you to do one more thing.

08:34.698 --> 08:36.615
So, did you hack
into their servers yet?

08:36.700 --> 08:38.333
He's still working on it.

08:38.418 --> 08:39.868
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,
my liege.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.137
As much as I'd like to spend
a lifetime in federal prison,

08:42.206 --> 08:43.922
I'm taking extra precautions
to mask my identity.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.006
Mel:
He's feeling

08:45.092 --> 08:46.174
extra paranoid today.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.776
That tends to happen
when an article comes out

08:47.878 --> 08:50.178
spotlighting our operations
for millions to read.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.347
Don't worry, there's no mention
of you two in there.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.299
Well, I mean,
people aren't stupid, rob.

08:54.384 --> 08:55.967
I mean, they know
you couldn't possibly pull off

08:56.053 --> 08:57.469
all that stuff without any help.

08:57.554 --> 09:00.222
Which, the, uh, journalist
failed to mention, by the way.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.474
Are you upset because
the article implies you exist

09:02.559 --> 09:04.392
or doesn't imply you exist?

09:04.478 --> 09:07.262
Yes.
A little anonymous credit
wouldn't hurt.

09:07.364 --> 09:09.064
After five years of being dead,

09:09.149 --> 09:11.283
one tends to feel
a little unappreciated.

09:11.401 --> 09:12.867
I appreciate you, baby.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.236
Thanks, honey.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.238
All right, I'm in their servers.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.906
Huh.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.241
There's no mention
of a malik johnson.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.243
Which means they haven't
charged him with anything.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.877
And he's been
there for hours.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.162
It doesn't track.

09:24.248 --> 09:25.880
The kid's an honor student.
His mom said

09:25.966 --> 09:27.749
he's never missed
a day of school in his life.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.885
Well, not exactly
dea's-most-wanted material.

09:30.954 --> 09:32.170
So, why are they holding him?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.674
Hey.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.893
We, uh, have an issue.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.515
Bradley:
Don't move.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.404
Robyn:
I don't give a damn
where I can and can't be.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.156
I'm not leaving here
till you let me

09:51.275 --> 09:53.008
speak to my nephew.
Bradley:
Hey.

09:53.110 --> 09:55.143
What seems to be the problem?
Robyn:
Well, you tell me

09:55.245 --> 09:56.945
what the problem is.
You're holding my nephew,

09:57.030 --> 09:59.314
malik johnson. Why?

09:59.416 --> 10:00.815
How did you know
he was here?

10:00.917 --> 10:01.950
How do you think I know?

10:02.035 --> 10:04.286
I followed
that broke-ass van of yours.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.820
What are you holding him for?

10:05.922 --> 10:07.172
What'd he do?

10:07.291 --> 10:09.024
Oh, you don't
want to tell me.

10:09.126 --> 10:11.343
Because I can have
my lawyers here within the hour.

10:11.461 --> 10:13.295
Fine. You want to know?

10:13.380 --> 10:15.797
He trafficked drugs
across state lines.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.465
So, go ahead, call your lawyers,

10:17.551 --> 10:18.683
but then we're gonna have
to charge him.

10:18.802 --> 10:20.302
You have him on trafficking,

10:20.387 --> 10:21.720
but you haven't charged him yet?

10:21.805 --> 10:23.138
Seeley:
We don't want to.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.056
Not if we don't have to.
We're trying to help him.

10:25.142 --> 10:26.107
Look, the kid made a mistake.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.142
We're not trying
to ruin his future.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.509
We just want him
to help us out a little.

10:28.612 --> 10:30.779
You have him working for you?

10:30.864 --> 10:32.781
Let me speak to him.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.784
Just so I can let his
mother know he's okay.

10:45.212 --> 10:48.129
You were the one
on the street.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.697
Who are you?

10:49.800 --> 10:51.049
Friend of your mom's.

10:51.168 --> 10:53.101
She was worried about you.

10:53.203 --> 10:54.969
And from the looks
of it, she was right.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.472
Please, don't tell her.
It'd kill her.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.507
And it's not what you think.

10:59.593 --> 11:00.892
Well, you tell me what it is.

11:01.011 --> 11:02.394
They say you trafficked drugs.

11:02.512 --> 11:04.379
No, I...

11:04.481 --> 11:06.931
I went to a party.
Okay? That's all.

11:07.017 --> 11:09.684
At a friend's house in jersey.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.905
There was this drunk dude
passing out molly.

11:14.024 --> 11:16.908
He shoved some in my hand,
and it wasn't my thing,

11:17.027 --> 11:19.694
so I stuffed it in my pocket
and I forgot about it.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.664
Taking the path train home.

11:22.749 --> 11:25.283
Next thing I know,
the feds are frisking me.

11:25.369 --> 11:27.369
They were monitoring
the party.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.372
Crossing lines back from jersey
made it federal.

11:30.474 --> 11:32.123
They said it was a slam dunk,

11:32.209 --> 11:33.842
that I'd serve
five years unless...

11:33.944 --> 11:35.543
Unless you helped them out.

11:35.629 --> 11:38.963
Why didn't you
go to your mom?
How could I?

11:39.049 --> 11:40.682
I mean,
she's worked day and night

11:40.767 --> 11:42.217
making sure
that everything was good for me.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.219
Even if we could afford
a lawyer, which we can't,

11:44.304 --> 11:46.388
it would still cost me
my scholarship.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.940
I'd be throwing away my future.

11:50.694 --> 11:52.644
The only way out was to say yes.

11:54.698 --> 11:55.980
But, uh...

11:56.066 --> 11:57.449
But what?

12:00.487 --> 12:02.303
They got me going
to this stash house.

12:02.406 --> 12:04.656
Making buys off this dealer.

12:04.741 --> 12:06.491
It was only supposed to be,
like, once or twice,

12:06.576 --> 12:08.609
but every time I do it,
they say I got to do it more.

12:08.712 --> 12:10.778
And since you're not
under arrest,

12:10.881 --> 12:12.714
you have no rights.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.582
And it's off-book,

12:14.634 --> 12:17.118
so the agents can change
the deal all they want.

12:17.187 --> 12:18.920
Yeah, well,
they just changed it again.

12:19.005 --> 12:21.256
Now they saying I got to plant
a bug at the house.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.757
I mean, if I get caught...

12:22.843 --> 12:24.325
You won't get caught.

12:24.428 --> 12:26.394
Because you're not doing it.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.396
We will put an end to this
right now.

12:28.482 --> 12:29.681
(door opens)
bradley:
Okay.

12:29.766 --> 12:32.467
You talked to him. You good?

12:32.569 --> 12:33.735
Actually, I'm not.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.103
Threatening my nephew

12:35.188 --> 12:38.022
over a few tabs of x he
didn't even know he had?

12:38.108 --> 12:40.909
Forcing him to put his life
at risk to do your job?

12:40.994 --> 12:42.243
We're not making
him do anything.

12:42.329 --> 12:45.363
We're giving him a choice.

12:45.449 --> 12:48.750
Ruin his future
or risk his life?

12:48.835 --> 12:50.702
What kind of choice is that?

12:50.787 --> 12:52.287
His.

12:53.507 --> 12:56.007
Your aunt seems to think
we're treating you unfairly.

12:56.126 --> 12:57.692
That what you think?

12:57.794 --> 12:59.660
'cause you're
in control here.

12:59.763 --> 13:01.996
You're free to walk out
that door anytime you want.

13:02.098 --> 13:04.516
But then you know
what'll happen.

13:08.772 --> 13:10.338
I'll do it.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.056
Hmm?

13:12.142 --> 13:13.858
I'll stay.

13:13.977 --> 13:17.896
Well, looks like
we're done here.

13:19.916 --> 13:21.483
Listen,

13:21.568 --> 13:23.535
you stay strong.

13:23.653 --> 13:26.738
That's my new number. You call
me if you need me, nephew.

13:30.327 --> 13:33.294
(door opens, closes)

13:34.214 --> 13:35.747
they were blackmailing him,
and all I could do

13:35.832 --> 13:37.165
was sit there and take it.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.502
Now they have this kid
planting a bug in a stash house.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.804
Why are the feds
outsourcing an investigation

13:42.889 --> 13:45.974
of a drug gang to a teen
with zero training?

13:46.059 --> 13:48.309
I mean, is-is that
really their best move?

13:48.395 --> 13:50.011
It's their easiest move.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.880
Kids like malik are free,
expendable

13:52.983 --> 13:54.716
and easy to intimidate.

13:54.818 --> 13:56.935
Leveraging teens
for minor infractions

13:57.020 --> 13:58.903
and putting them
in high-risk situations?

13:59.022 --> 14:00.655
That's got to be illegal.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.223
Well, it should be,
but it isn't.

14:02.325 --> 14:04.242
And a lot of them
end up getting killed.

14:04.361 --> 14:05.743
They get away
with it because

14:05.862 --> 14:07.612
most of these kids are from
disadvantaged neighborhoods.

14:07.697 --> 14:09.364
Don't have advocates.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.400
Well, this kid's got us,
so what's our best play?

14:12.502 --> 14:13.451
He's going back in today.

14:13.537 --> 14:15.403
We have to find
that stash house.

14:15.505 --> 14:17.705
Keep him
from ending up a statistic.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.407
Look, even if I could get back
into the servers,

14:19.509 --> 14:22.093
this-this operation's probably
off-book because of malik.

14:22.212 --> 14:25.213
Investigation
into a local player,

14:25.298 --> 14:28.383
dea would have to be leaning
on cops.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.718
Meaning the nypd
might have intel

14:30.804 --> 14:32.637
on the stash house location.

14:32.722 --> 14:34.305
Spoke to my friends
in narcotics.

14:34.391 --> 14:36.357
The feds are being tight-lipped
on this one,

14:36.443 --> 14:39.027
but they did tell narcotics
to steer clear

14:39.112 --> 14:40.728
of 167th and douglas in jamaica.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.697
Robyn:
<i> 167th and douglas.</i>

14:42.799 --> 14:44.165
Any idea whose turf that is?

14:44.267 --> 14:45.700
Yeah. Sixth street mafia.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.903
Operation run
by a player named lamar starks.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.822
What's his rep?
Ambitious and ruthless.

14:50.907 --> 14:53.575
He makes your kid,
he won't hesitate to smoke him.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.460
(sighs)
thanks, marcus.

14:55.579 --> 14:57.829
Listen,
watch your six out there.

14:57.914 --> 14:59.614
'cause the new guy's digging

14:59.716 --> 15:01.499
into your world.
D.A.'s lit a fire under his ass

15:01.585 --> 15:02.717
because of that article.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.052
Let him dig.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.953
I've been chased by better.

15:06.056 --> 15:10.091
True. But even a blind squirrel
finds a nut once in a while.

15:16.199 --> 15:19.150
Bradley:
Look, don't be so nervous.

15:19.269 --> 15:20.801
All you got to do

15:20.904 --> 15:22.487
is put this
somewhere out of the way

15:22.606 --> 15:24.322
while you make the buy.

15:24.441 --> 15:26.157
What if they see?

15:26.276 --> 15:28.326
Anything goes south,
say the safe word,

15:28.445 --> 15:29.611
and we'll pull you.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.863
"I told my moms
I'd be home soon."

15:33.867 --> 15:35.283
(sighs)

15:35.368 --> 15:37.619
I told my moms I'd be home soon.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.754
I told my moms
I'd be home soon.

15:39.856 --> 15:43.424
164th and douglas.
That's a good spot for dealing.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.344
Easy subway access.
No stores to draw patrols.

15:46.463 --> 15:47.845
Anything stand out?

15:47.964 --> 15:49.681
Look at the three homes
on the corner.

15:49.799 --> 15:51.432
Blacked-out windows.
One of them has got to be

15:51.518 --> 15:53.401
our stash house.
Robyn:
Check property records.

15:53.503 --> 15:54.769
See if any are abandoned.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.638
What'd you find on lamar starks?

15:56.740 --> 15:58.005
Dante was being kind.

15:58.108 --> 15:59.941
Has a dozen
aggravated assaults.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.559
Suspect in two homicides.

16:01.645 --> 16:04.379
Deals coke,
black tar heroin,

16:04.481 --> 16:06.280
and has been expanding
into opioids.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.684
Set off a turf war
with a rival gang named k-block.

16:09.786 --> 16:11.819
Malik is not about
that street life.

16:11.921 --> 16:13.871
Starks will eat him alive.

16:13.990 --> 16:15.239
All right,
pulled up the property records.

16:15.325 --> 16:17.692
Looks like you're going
to 824 douglas.

16:17.794 --> 16:19.193
Condemned three years ago.

16:19.295 --> 16:20.411
Been abandoned ever since.

16:20.497 --> 16:22.714
Easy pickings for a dealer
looking to set up shop.

16:22.799 --> 16:24.716
Yeah, and we got
front-row seats

16:24.801 --> 16:26.334
to the action thanks
to a couple of doorbell cams

16:26.419 --> 16:27.335
in the neighborhood.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.170
Mel:
Here comes malik.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.555
Mccall, he's going in.

16:30.674 --> 16:31.973
Damn it.

16:55.281 --> 16:58.082
Baby boy in the house.

16:58.201 --> 16:59.951
What's up, devon?

17:00.036 --> 17:01.586
Where is everyone?

17:01.705 --> 17:02.837
Oh, they'll be here.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.789
Have a seat.

17:10.714 --> 17:14.048
So, what's your plan?

17:14.134 --> 17:15.600
What do you mean?

17:15.719 --> 17:17.218
Devon:
Mean if you don't want your face

17:17.303 --> 17:18.386
on the front
of your homey's t-shirt,

17:18.471 --> 17:19.754
then you need a plan. Feel me?

17:19.856 --> 17:22.156
(chuckles softly)
don't trip, man.

17:22.258 --> 17:23.558
We got you.
(phone vibrates)

17:30.183 --> 17:31.833
hey, what up?

17:40.126 --> 17:41.209
Yeah, I got him.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.916
A'ight.

17:49.002 --> 17:51.002
A'ight.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.989
Everything good?

17:55.091 --> 17:56.641
Any reason it shouldn't be?

17:56.760 --> 17:59.010
No.
(chuckles softly)

17:59.095 --> 18:00.678
no, I'm just saying.

18:00.764 --> 18:02.647
What?

18:02.766 --> 18:04.532
Hmm? What you saying?

18:04.634 --> 18:07.185
(chuckles softly)
just saying.

18:09.272 --> 18:10.655
Robyn, how far
away are you?

18:10.774 --> 18:12.840
About five minutes. Why?

18:12.942 --> 18:14.975
Lamar starks just showed,
and he brought muscle.

18:15.078 --> 18:16.160
Either malik's
made an impression

18:16.279 --> 18:17.612
and he wants to meet him...
Yeah.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.781
Or they're onto him
and starks is there to end him.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.449
Well, I'm not waiting
to find out which.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.850
As soon as I get there,
I'm pulling him out.

18:22.952 --> 18:24.318
Harry:
You sure you want
to do that, rob?

18:24.420 --> 18:26.504
I mean, won't the dea step in
if there's trouble?

18:26.623 --> 18:28.339
Like I trust them
to look out for him.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.625
They're the reason
he's there in the first place.

18:35.381 --> 18:36.848
(door closes)

18:36.966 --> 18:38.999
this him?

18:39.102 --> 18:40.935
Yep.

18:49.012 --> 18:50.678
Come on, let's go, baby boy.

18:50.780 --> 18:52.730
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Where we going?

18:52.816 --> 18:55.449
I told my moms I'd be home soon.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.485
That's the safe word. Let's go.
No, no. No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.203
He's-he's just panicking.
He's fine.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.656
Let's go.

19:05.461 --> 19:06.527
What if they made him?

19:06.629 --> 19:08.412
Look, if we rush in now,
he's dead anyway.

19:08.498 --> 19:10.248
Let's just see
where it goes.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.049
What, you want to blow
six months of work?

19:17.006 --> 19:18.723
(tires screech)
hey.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.510
It's that woman, the aunt.

19:31.654 --> 19:33.888
Hey.
Robyn:
Where is he?

19:33.990 --> 19:35.356
Where's malik?
Seeley:
He's not inside?

19:35.441 --> 19:37.491
They're gone. All of them.
What the hell

19:37.577 --> 19:39.160
are you doing here?
You let them take him?

19:39.245 --> 19:40.528
Why didn't you pull him out?

19:40.613 --> 19:41.996
Look, I don't know
who you think you are,

19:42.081 --> 19:43.397
but you're interfering
with a federal investigation

19:43.499 --> 19:44.498
right now.
Do you understand that?

19:44.601 --> 19:46.300
Tell me
you put a tracker on him.

19:46.369 --> 19:47.501
She's right. They're gone.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.403
What?
You didn't, did you?

19:49.505 --> 19:51.072
Do you know where
they're taking him?
Did you hear what I said?

19:51.174 --> 19:52.673
You're...
Yeah, I heard you.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.509
You want to haul me in? Do it.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.879
Then I can put on record
exactly how

19:57.964 --> 19:59.847
and why you lost
an 18-year-old kid

19:59.933 --> 20:01.766
you were sworn to protect.

20:01.885 --> 20:03.301
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

20:03.386 --> 20:06.137
For all you know, they
took him to kill him.

20:06.222 --> 20:08.639
You better pray he's unharmed
when I find him.

20:08.725 --> 20:10.725
Or you're both
gonna answer.

20:18.268 --> 20:19.684
Robyn: Come on, harry,
tell me you found them.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.352
I-I don't even
know what I'm looking for here.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.853
I mean, they must have had
a car parked out back.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.388
Look, we're checking
all the traffic cams,

20:24.474 --> 20:25.890
so maybe we'll get lucky.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.975
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.
There's six freeway entrances

20:28.061 --> 20:29.810
nearby-- they could've
taken any one of them.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.046

21:04.614 --> 21:06.814
Malik?

21:06.916 --> 21:08.416
He must have his sound off.

21:08.518 --> 21:09.717
I think he's trying
to signal us.

21:09.819 --> 21:11.085
Can you track his phone?

21:11.187 --> 21:13.220
Uh, his gps is still off.
I can triangulate his signal

21:13.323 --> 21:14.655
but its gonna take a minute.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.407
We're about
to pass frankie's.

21:16.526 --> 21:17.992
Can we grab a burger
or something?

21:18.077 --> 21:19.076
Robyn:

21:39.549 --> 21:40.931
That'll help us

Attaboy, malik.

Dee!

22:03.740 --> 22:05.323
Harry, any updates?

22:05.408 --> 22:07.908
I had 'em-- they're in a black
suv, but I lost coverage.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.378
What?!
Hey, don't shoot
the messenger, man!

22:10.463 --> 22:12.546
They made a left a few minutes
ago on 51st and thompson.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.332
I-I haven't been able
to pick 'em back up since.

22:14.417 --> 22:15.966
We still have audio
on malik's phone, though.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.117
Let's hear.

22:17.220 --> 22:19.220
Starks:
Yo, young blood, out the car.

22:19.322 --> 22:20.888
Come on, come on.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.790
Heard you trying to get paid.

22:22.892 --> 22:24.458
If that's the case, you need
a family to watch your back.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.460
Know what I mean?

22:26.562 --> 22:28.429
You see that barbershop?

22:28.531 --> 22:30.798
There's a fat-ass lame
named simms.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.800
Gets a shave
there every week.

22:32.902 --> 22:35.102
He been trying to muscle
in on our territory.

22:35.204 --> 22:37.571
Now, fat man get a chicken
parm from mamma c's

22:37.657 --> 22:40.140
delivered every
time he there.

22:40.243 --> 22:43.577
But today there's gonna
be a new delivery boy.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.534
I-I-I don't think
I'm the one for this.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.553
I don't think you understand.

22:52.655 --> 22:54.722
It's not like you have a choice.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.658
(phone ringing)

22:57.760 --> 22:59.293
how's the kid?

22:59.379 --> 23:01.862
He got in a car with lamar
starks. We were tracking him.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.881
Last seen at 51st and thompson.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.132
Thompson street?

23:05.234 --> 23:06.534
What's starks doing
all the way over there?

23:06.636 --> 23:07.802
That's k-block turf.

23:07.904 --> 23:09.303
We got audio
through malik's phone.

23:09.405 --> 23:11.138
Something about sending him
into a barbershop

23:11.224 --> 23:12.540
just before we lost signal.

23:12.642 --> 23:13.941
Does that mean anything to you?

23:14.026 --> 23:16.677
Wait... A barbershop?

23:18.981 --> 23:20.381
Hold up, bruh.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.416
Delivery from mama c's.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.686
Thanks.

23:25.788 --> 23:26.787
(electric razors buzzing)

23:32.929 --> 23:34.862
uh, delivery from mama c's?

23:34.964 --> 23:36.730
For simms.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.417
Slow your roll.
I'll take that.

23:42.138 --> 23:44.171
Yo, hold up.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.177
Your tip, lil man.

23:50.263 --> 23:53.380
(chuckles)
thanks.

23:53.483 --> 23:56.350
Yo, g.

23:57.553 --> 23:59.386
What happened to frito?

23:59.489 --> 24:00.855
Uh, he's out today.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.657
Yeah, I ain't seen you before.
Papa tony hire you?

24:05.077 --> 24:07.661
Yeah. Yeah.

24:07.763 --> 24:09.797
(chuckles)
that's interesting.

24:09.899 --> 24:13.367
'cause papa tony
passed away last year.

24:20.243 --> 24:21.425
Clean.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.077
Check the bag.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.546
Bomb!

24:25.631 --> 24:27.281
You gonna die!
I didn't know!
I'm telling you I didn't know!

24:27.383 --> 24:30.468
Easy! Everybody just chill out.

24:30.553 --> 24:33.086
Take the bag out back.
Put it in a sewer.

24:33.189 --> 24:35.723
Carefully.

24:35.825 --> 24:38.058
Won't mess nothing up
down there.

24:38.161 --> 24:40.127
Water will disable it.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.263
No, no...
Yeah.

24:42.365 --> 24:44.782
You in a world of hurt,
little man.

24:44.901 --> 24:46.700
(gunfire)

24:47.653 --> 24:48.936
robyn:
Malik!

24:49.038 --> 24:51.438
(grunting)

24:51.541 --> 24:53.207
get in!

24:59.298 --> 25:01.332
(indistinct chatter)

25:03.152 --> 25:05.386
detective mallory,
what are you doing here?

25:05.471 --> 25:07.721
I could ask
you the same.

25:07.823 --> 25:09.974
I'm responding
to an incident.

25:10.092 --> 25:12.493
Someone used the k-block guys
for target practice.

25:12.595 --> 25:13.727
Any idea who?

25:13.813 --> 25:15.462
A rival dealer was seen
leaving the area.

25:15.565 --> 25:17.147
Lamar starks.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.066
Head of the sixth street mafia.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.968
Interesting.
From what I caught

25:21.070 --> 25:23.571
on the scanner, a witness
description of the shooter

25:23.656 --> 25:25.823
sounded an awful lot
like our vigilante.

25:25.942 --> 25:27.808
She taking sides
in a turf war now?

25:27.910 --> 25:29.326
I don't know anything
about that.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.612
You sure? Because it
seems like wherever she is,

25:31.697 --> 25:33.480
you're not far behind.

25:33.583 --> 25:35.316
You were first
on the scene here, right?

25:35.418 --> 25:36.984
Just doing my job,
detective.

25:37.086 --> 25:39.169
Of course.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.322
I'm gonna do mine.

25:46.963 --> 25:48.161
It's mallory.

25:48.264 --> 25:50.681
I want everything
we got on lamar starks,

25:50.800 --> 25:53.267
head of the sixth street mafia.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.371
Robyn:
Hey.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.224
This is my friend mel.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.393
She's gonna take you
somewhere safe.
Hi.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.812
Hey, uh, but...

26:04.897 --> 26:06.480
What about my mom?

26:06.566 --> 26:08.032
What if lamar finds
where I live?

26:08.150 --> 26:09.950
We've made arrangements
for her, too.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.086
My baby!

26:12.188 --> 26:14.622
Mom, I-I messed up.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.073
I let you down.
Look at me, malik.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.709
The only way you could
ever let me down

26:18.828 --> 26:20.360
was if you didn't come home.

26:20.463 --> 26:22.963
Whatever this is,

26:23.049 --> 26:24.698
we'll get through it together.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.550
Come here.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.218
I love you.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.386
Love you, too.

26:29.505 --> 26:30.537
Thank you.

26:30.640 --> 26:33.073
Thank god he's okay.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.209
But by my math,
including the feds,

26:35.311 --> 26:37.394
he now has
three gangs after him.

26:37.513 --> 26:40.097
Yeah. Just get 'em
to the safehouse.

26:40.182 --> 26:43.383
Keep 'em secure until we
can figure out what to do.

26:43.486 --> 26:44.735
Okay.

26:44.854 --> 26:46.854
(phone buzzing)

26:52.328 --> 26:54.361
hey, auntie.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.115
What happened?

27:01.621 --> 27:03.704
Aunt vi told me

27:03.789 --> 27:05.839
about the memorial.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.626
You okay?

27:10.212 --> 27:12.880
Well, according to every kid

27:12.965 --> 27:15.466
who got up to speak,
they were all jason's best

27:15.551 --> 27:18.135
and closest friend.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.304
Meanwhile, 90% of them
never even spoke to jason

27:20.389 --> 27:21.939
when he was alive.

27:22.058 --> 27:24.758
And so you walked out.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.445
And you tossed your eulogy.

27:28.564 --> 27:31.398
I didn't want to be one of them.

27:32.702 --> 27:36.487
I mean, they were using
my friend-- who died--

27:36.572 --> 27:39.106
to make themselves
more important.

27:39.208 --> 27:42.292
For some people,
tragedy's a magnet.

27:42.378 --> 27:45.445
A chance to say
they escaped a brush with danger

27:45.548 --> 27:46.947
and lived to tell the tale.

27:47.049 --> 27:48.966
Okay, but they didn't.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.218
They have no idea
what it was like.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.137
What he was like.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.956
So I am putting them on blast.

27:56.058 --> 27:59.259
Okay, the whole school is gonna
know how full of it they are.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.095
And that'll make
you feel better?

28:01.180 --> 28:02.629
Yes!

28:02.732 --> 28:04.181
For how long?

28:05.568 --> 28:07.434
Do you think
you're gonna change them?

28:11.323 --> 28:12.523
No.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.945
I mean, but...

28:18.030 --> 28:19.446
What do I do, mom?

28:19.532 --> 28:21.865
I mean, just let them
get away with it?

28:21.951 --> 28:24.585
I have to stick up for jason.

28:24.670 --> 28:26.704
Of course you do.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.874
I'm just wondering...

28:34.296 --> 28:36.830
...Is that the way jason
would want to be defended?

28:36.932 --> 28:38.182
What do you mean?

28:38.300 --> 28:39.600
I mean,

28:39.685 --> 28:43.520
what you decide to do
is part of jason's legacy, too.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.806
How do you want him
to be remembered?

28:45.891 --> 28:48.058
By those words?

28:49.445 --> 28:51.145
Or by these?

28:52.748 --> 28:56.183
Baby, some people's minds
aren't worth trying to change.

28:56.285 --> 28:59.119
Not once they've
shown you who they are.

29:06.028 --> 29:07.161
Mel:
<i> Okay, so they've</i>

29:07.246 --> 29:08.796
shown us who they are.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.914
How's that gonna save malik?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.232
Greed.

29:12.334 --> 29:13.801
These gangs aren't
much different

29:13.903 --> 29:15.469
than the warlords in mogadishu.

29:15.571 --> 29:17.504
They all had one thing
in common.

29:17.590 --> 29:19.673
They all wanted more.

29:19.759 --> 29:22.226
Made 'em blind.

29:22.344 --> 29:26.180
So when the cia sent me in,
I used that greed against them.

29:27.516 --> 29:30.984
The feds used malik because they
were greedy for the bust.

29:32.188 --> 29:35.422
Lamar moved on simms because
he's greedy for territory.

29:35.524 --> 29:38.242
And simms wants to expand

29:38.360 --> 29:40.360
his empire.

29:41.664 --> 29:43.247
We can use that.

29:43.365 --> 29:44.564
What are you thinking?

29:44.667 --> 29:45.949
Something risky.

29:46.035 --> 29:48.368
But if we pull it off,
we can end this.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.254
But I'm gonna need your help.

29:50.372 --> 29:52.706
You had me at risky.
What's the plan?

29:54.009 --> 29:57.427
Have to admit, I'm surprised
to see you, miss...

29:57.546 --> 29:59.246
You don't get my name.

29:59.348 --> 30:00.747
And I'm not here
to answer questions

30:00.850 --> 30:03.050
about the barbershop or malik.

30:08.023 --> 30:09.890
Feel free to run prints.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.525
You won't find
anything.

30:11.610 --> 30:12.726
Who are you?

30:12.812 --> 30:14.478
Let's say
I'm an interested party.

30:14.563 --> 30:17.397
With a lot of people
interested in you.

30:19.401 --> 30:22.569
What's to stop us from calling
the nypd right now?

30:22.655 --> 30:25.372
You want sixth street mafia.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.824
And I can help.

30:26.909 --> 30:28.842
Not just them.

30:28.911 --> 30:31.611
K-block, too.

30:31.714 --> 30:34.131
That'd be a pretty solid flex,

30:34.250 --> 30:36.783
busting lamar starks

30:36.886 --> 30:38.919
and charles simms.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.120
(exhales)

30:40.222 --> 30:41.621
no way you can deliver that.

30:41.724 --> 30:43.757
You read that article.

30:45.678 --> 30:48.795
That only scratches the surface
of what I'm capable of.

30:48.898 --> 30:50.964
What do you get out of it?

30:51.066 --> 30:53.133
Malik.

30:53.235 --> 30:56.937
If I succeed, you cut him loose.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.605
Permanently.

30:58.691 --> 30:59.823
And if you fail?

30:59.942 --> 31:01.909
Then I'm out of your hair.

31:01.994 --> 31:03.610
Permanently.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.145
You win either way.

31:05.247 --> 31:06.363
So...

31:06.448 --> 31:08.882
What do you say?

31:08.951 --> 31:11.919
Here's everything narcotics
has on lamar starks.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.203
Locations?
A complete work-up.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.388
Thanks.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.707
Yeah, happy hunting.

31:35.694 --> 31:38.312
♪ ♪

31:41.617 --> 31:42.649
hello, lamar.

31:42.735 --> 31:44.217
Dea.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.320
Up against the car.

31:47.289 --> 31:49.022
What you want with me?
I ain't did nothing.

31:49.124 --> 31:52.125
(chuckles)
oh, you've done plenty.

31:55.297 --> 31:57.197
Starks:
Dominicans still trippin'?

31:57.299 --> 31:58.865
Cap another one. Yo, devon,

31:58.968 --> 32:00.334
bring those keys in here.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.336
Dea's had a bug
in your stash house

32:02.421 --> 32:03.503
for months.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.255
You're looking at a long vacay

32:05.341 --> 32:06.873
at the rikers b and b.

32:06.976 --> 32:08.475
Lucky for you,

32:08.577 --> 32:10.427
it's not you we're after.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.145
We want charles simms.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.931
I ain't got nothing
to do with the fat man.

32:14.016 --> 32:16.316
Oh, I wouldn't call a botched
barbershop hit nothing.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.319
Looks to me

32:19.405 --> 32:21.321
like you're as anxious
to get rid of simms as we are.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.106
Simms made a mistake.

32:23.192 --> 32:25.242
He didn't stay in the hood.

32:25.361 --> 32:27.110
He started moving
on zip codes that, uh...

32:27.196 --> 32:29.196
Certain people care about.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.948
We can't have that.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.116
Help us take him down

32:33.202 --> 32:35.752
and we'll look the other way
as you soak up his territory.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.421
You must think I'm a fool.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.239
I thought you were
a businessman.

32:39.341 --> 32:42.575
Look, we put simms away, we know
someone's gonna take his place.

32:42.678 --> 32:45.045
Might as well be someone

32:45.130 --> 32:46.430
that we have a deal with.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.415
Snitch?
(scoffs)

32:48.517 --> 32:50.083
nah, you got me twisted.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.135
Do you want to level up?

32:52.221 --> 32:54.271
Be a kingpin?

32:54.390 --> 32:56.589
'cause this is how it happens.

32:56.692 --> 32:58.258
We help each other.

32:58.360 --> 33:01.094
And we both get paid.

33:01.196 --> 33:03.063
So you in the game?

33:03.165 --> 33:05.532
Yeah, you think I do this
for my pension?

33:05.617 --> 33:07.934
Give a taste, get a taste.

33:07.987 --> 33:10.871
There's no reason
we can't all win.

33:13.826 --> 33:15.325
What you got in mind?

33:15.411 --> 33:16.877
I just need you...

33:18.781 --> 33:21.248
...To make a call.

33:23.185 --> 33:25.352
Starks: Killing each other
don't do either of us no good.

33:25.454 --> 33:27.387
So not only
am I offering a truce,

33:27.473 --> 33:29.339
but I propose
we combine our crews

33:29.425 --> 33:31.174
and take over the city.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.010
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

33:33.095 --> 33:35.679
especially after the barber
shop, but the big homies

33:35.764 --> 33:37.347
sat me down,
told me I was wildin'.

33:37.433 --> 33:39.566
So as a show of good faith,

33:39.651 --> 33:42.486
I'm offering a bag
and that black to go with it.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.471
That ain't nothing.

33:44.573 --> 33:46.806
It's enough to make
your life hard.

33:46.909 --> 33:49.192
But this is not about you.

33:49.278 --> 33:52.112
We've been onto starks
for months.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.147
Dea sees
this peace offering

33:54.249 --> 33:56.750
as a chance
to take lamar down.

33:57.953 --> 34:00.653
With the amount of cash
and product he'll be bringing,

34:00.756 --> 34:02.155
we'll have everything we need

34:02.257 --> 34:04.624
to put him away
for a very long time.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.344
Lady, starks
doesn't want a truce.

34:07.463 --> 34:09.513
He wants to smoke me.

34:09.631 --> 34:11.465
Well, we know that.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.666
But what he doesn't know
is that we're on to him.

34:13.769 --> 34:15.969
And we're backing you.

34:16.055 --> 34:17.170
What?

34:17.272 --> 34:18.472
You didn't know that?

34:18.557 --> 34:20.006
Why do you think
you're sitting here

34:20.109 --> 34:22.609
instead of in the yard?

34:22.694 --> 34:24.728
We like how you do business.

34:24.813 --> 34:27.147
With minimal violence.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.900
The dea would rather have
someone with restraint

34:29.985 --> 34:32.369
sitting at the top
of the pyramid.

34:32.488 --> 34:34.571
Or you could not play ball

34:34.656 --> 34:37.240
and we'll come after you, too.

34:37.359 --> 34:39.392
Unless lamar gets
to you first.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.880
(phone beeps)

34:43.999 --> 34:46.133
(line ringing)

34:46.218 --> 34:47.717
starks, it's simms.

34:47.836 --> 34:49.920
I accept your offer.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.371
Yeah, bet.

34:51.473 --> 34:53.507
I'll be in touch
with when and where.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.709
He buy it?

34:56.812 --> 34:58.178
Doubt it.

34:58.263 --> 34:59.813
Fat man is smart.

34:59.898 --> 35:01.214
He'll try something.

35:01.316 --> 35:02.549
Make sure
the boys is ready.

35:02.651 --> 35:05.485
What about the feds?

35:05.571 --> 35:08.522
All I know is we gonna
finish what we started.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.241
Feds can arrest a corpse,
all I care.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.725
I give the signal,

35:12.828 --> 35:15.112
the boys take out simms.

35:15.197 --> 35:17.697
And anybody else can get it
as long as my hands stay clean.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.059
The boys in position?

35:29.178 --> 35:30.427
Yeah, you know it.

35:30.512 --> 35:34.548
You give the signal, they
gonna light it up out there.

36:02.177 --> 36:04.077
Appreciate you coming out.

36:04.179 --> 36:06.246
You got nerve, starks.

36:06.348 --> 36:08.215
What you pulled
at the barber shop.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.050
Yeah, that's why we here.

36:10.135 --> 36:11.417
To make that right.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.553
Simms: See, that's the problem
with you youngsters.

36:13.639 --> 36:14.721
You don't respect...

36:14.806 --> 36:16.723
How the hell did she get
them both to wear wires?

36:16.808 --> 36:19.226
You got to give respect
to get respect...

36:19.311 --> 36:20.810
Harry:
How's it going?

36:20.896 --> 36:22.262
Almost too well.

36:22.364 --> 36:23.647
Wish I could see their faces
when they realize

36:23.765 --> 36:25.332
that they've totally
incriminated themselves

36:25.434 --> 36:28.368
and they don't actually have
a deal with the feds.

36:30.239 --> 36:31.371
Davis, it's me.

36:31.456 --> 36:33.073
I followed starks
to some kind of meet.

36:33.158 --> 36:34.958
Probably a drug exchange.

36:35.077 --> 36:37.160
I'm gonna need
all available units.

36:37.246 --> 36:39.129
453 industry.

36:39.248 --> 36:40.446
No sirens.

36:40.549 --> 36:41.298
You got it.

36:41.416 --> 36:42.615
You find the vigilante?

36:42.718 --> 36:45.135
No, but if she's working
with starks,

36:45.254 --> 36:46.670
she'll be here somewhere.

36:46.755 --> 36:48.638
I want checkpoints
on all roads leading in

36:48.757 --> 36:49.890
and out of this location.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.008
What the...

36:52.094 --> 36:54.978
Be careful
what you ask for.

36:55.097 --> 36:56.263
Hang up.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.630
(phone beeps)

36:57.733 --> 36:59.766
your phone.

37:03.405 --> 37:05.021
Weapon.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.745
I thought you were
smarter than this.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.830
You know what the sentence is
for threatening an officer?

37:13.916 --> 37:16.750
Yeah, zero days in jail

37:16.835 --> 37:18.451
if you can't bring me in.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.320
You're making a huge mistake.

37:20.422 --> 37:23.707
Maybe. But I'm stopping you
from making an even bigger one.

37:23.792 --> 37:25.959
Trust me when I say
you don't want any part

37:26.044 --> 37:27.761
of what's
going down here tonight.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.014
Call your guy.

37:31.133 --> 37:33.266
Call off the backup.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.801
Now.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.773
Simms:
<i> You got the stuff?</i>

37:39.858 --> 37:41.608
Or we just out here jawin'?

37:41.693 --> 37:43.193
Starks:
I got it.

37:43.312 --> 37:44.227
You agree to terms?

38:25.354 --> 38:26.853
Smart choice.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.388
Dea! You're under arrest!

38:28.490 --> 38:29.773
Dea agent:
Move this way!

38:29.858 --> 38:30.991
(overlapping shouting)

38:31.076 --> 38:31.992
do not move!

38:32.077 --> 38:33.777
Hands up where
I can see them!

38:33.862 --> 38:35.495
Dea agent 2:
Behind your back now!

38:37.949 --> 38:39.532
All right, let's move.
Come on, man.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.334
You were right
about lamar's guys.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.619
Thanks for the tip.

38:42.704 --> 38:45.171
And thank you
for the heads up on mallory.

38:45.257 --> 38:46.339
I owe you.

38:46.425 --> 38:47.907
That was all my pleasure.

38:48.010 --> 38:50.010
(laughs)
I know it was.

38:50.095 --> 38:52.679
But I got
you a little something anyway

38:52.764 --> 38:54.514
just to show my appreciation.

38:54.599 --> 38:57.767
(grunting)

38:57.886 --> 39:00.887
(knocking)

39:06.028 --> 39:08.561
big game hunting, huh?

39:08.647 --> 39:10.280
Shut up, will you?

39:10.399 --> 39:12.449
Just uncuff me.

39:12.567 --> 39:15.402
Not much fun when the lion's
got the gun, is it?

39:16.571 --> 39:20.206
Good thing
she stopped you, though.

39:20.292 --> 39:22.826
You almost blew
a major federal operation.

39:25.497 --> 39:27.213
Henry:
<i> So,</i>

39:27.299 --> 39:29.516
thanks to overwhelming
evidence, starks, simms

39:29.584 --> 39:31.051
and their organizations

39:31.136 --> 39:32.335
are no longer a
threat to malik

39:32.421 --> 39:33.720
or the city.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.088
Not bad for the vigilante

39:35.173 --> 39:36.890
and her nameless,
unrecognized team.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.308
You still on that article?

39:38.427 --> 39:40.176
Little bit.

39:40.262 --> 39:41.561
I just wish more
had changed.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.813
We may have saved
malik, but the dea

39:43.932 --> 39:45.798
is gonna keep extorting kids.

39:45.901 --> 39:47.517
More lives will be lost
and there's nothing

39:47.602 --> 39:49.035
we can do about it.

39:49.104 --> 39:50.937
Maybe not.

39:51.940 --> 39:55.175

41:07.182 --> 41:10.600
Or silly, but...

41:10.685 --> 41:13.736
One of the things
jason really believed

41:13.855 --> 41:16.222
was that an act of caring

41:16.324 --> 41:18.358
can change someone's world.

41:20.745 --> 41:22.779
(crying):
A smile...

41:24.616 --> 41:27.000
A smile can change
someone's day.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.870
(sniffles)

41:30.956 --> 41:33.373
but so can a bullet.

41:33.475 --> 41:36.676
The last thing...

41:36.761 --> 41:39.512
Jason did
before he was shot was...

41:39.598 --> 41:42.515
Turn to me and smile.

41:42.601 --> 41:43.883
(sniffles)

41:43.969 --> 41:46.302
it was always there
when I needed it most.

41:46.388 --> 41:48.188
And it was always...

41:48.273 --> 41:51.391
Impossible not to smile back.

41:52.727 --> 41:55.645
He believed the best
about people...

41:55.730 --> 41:57.930
And life and he was smart.

41:58.033 --> 42:00.617
But he never put anyone down

42:00.735 --> 42:02.935
for not knowing what he knew.

42:03.905 --> 42:07.290
You know, he actually made you
feel better about yourself.

42:08.076 --> 42:10.076
And I was so lucky...

42:11.046 --> 42:14.447
...So incredibly lucky

42:14.549 --> 42:16.299
to call him my friend.

42:16.418 --> 42:18.885
And in all the versions of...

42:18.970 --> 42:21.170
The better world
that we imagined...

42:22.307 --> 42:24.591
...Jason and I were
best friends.

42:25.677 --> 42:28.678
But one thing we never imagined

42:28.763 --> 42:31.931
was... A world
where jason wasn't in it.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.935
And I miss him.

42:36.021 --> 42:37.770
I miss him every day.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.572
And...

42:39.658 --> 42:42.108
I just wanted you all to know

42:42.193 --> 42:44.244
who he really was.

42:55.090 --> 42:56.005
My girl.
