00:01.710 --> 00:04.755
[Singing] It seems today that all you see

00:04.838 --> 00:08.091
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.175 --> 00:11.678
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.762 --> 00:14.473
On which we used to rely?

00:15.057 --> 00:17.768
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.393 --> 00:21.522
Lucky there's a man who
Positively can do

00:21.605 --> 00:23.106
All the things that make us

00:23.190 --> 00:24.983
Laugh and cry

00:25.067 --> 00:29.738
He's a family guy

00:35.160 --> 00:37.704
There's Craig Hoffman. He's such a rebel.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.124
Oh, my God, he is so gorgeous.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.377
And he plays by no one's rules
but his own.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.837
Meg, you should ask him out.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.548
I mean, you're the only one of us
who's ever had a real boyfriend.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.260
I'm back. I brought another picnic.

00:51.677 --> 00:54.930
You're such a good listener.
You're not like the other boys.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.393
You're so good with animals.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.437
I guess I could give it a try.
All right, here goes.

01:03.522 --> 01:04.523
Hi, Craig.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.110
I was wondering if maybe you'd want to...

01:08.193 --> 01:09.778
I don't know, go out sometime.

01:10.529 --> 01:14.032
That's about as likely as me playing
by someone else's rules besides my own...

01:14.116 --> 01:15.534
which I would never do.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.078
I play by my own rules, nobody else's.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.246
Not even my own.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.874
-How about a movie?
-I don't go out with dudes.

01:25.210 --> 01:29.506
-Mom, Dad, am I ugly?
-Of course not, sweetie.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.258
Yeah, where'd you get
a stupid idea like that?

01:31.341 --> 01:34.469
-Craig Hoffman.
-Craig Hoffman said that?

01:34.553 --> 01:36.430
Well, he's a sharp kid. You might be ugly.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.187
There, there, let me dry those tears.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.065
Yes, your anguish sustains me.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.443
Meg, honey, don't let
those awful kids at school...

01:49.526 --> 01:52.196
make you feel bad about yourself.
I tell you what.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.657
Tomorrow you and I are gonna go out
and get you some brand new outfits.

01:55.741 --> 01:59.536
Maybe a pair of those low-rider jeans
that'll show off your cute butt, huh?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.622
Really? Wow, thanks, Mom.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.207
Meg in low-riders.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.584
Enough of that.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.670
Go away, damn you.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.091
You're going to get it now.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.812
Oh, my God!

02:27.314 --> 02:29.358
Horace, what is this all about?

02:29.441 --> 02:32.110
What the hell's it look like?
I'm putting the bar up for sale.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.780
Please tell me
this is some kind of practical joke.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.449
Like the kind I used to play when
I was an intern at the hospital.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.119
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
Your wife's gonna be a vegetable.

02:41.203 --> 02:44.831
You'll have to bathe her, feed her
and care for her the rest of her life.

02:44.915 --> 02:45.999
Oh, my God.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.460
No, I'm just kidding. She's dead.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.879
Ever since that mega-mall opened
across the street...

02:50.963 --> 02:52.589
it's been taking away all my business.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.135
They got 300 stores, 200 restaurants...

02:57.219 --> 02:59.513
53 bars, and an indoor cattle ranch.

03:00.472 --> 03:04.351
[Effeminately] I go to Baskin-Robbins
every night and buy myself a little treat.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.520
Now, how in the hell am I supposed
to compete with that?

03:06.603 --> 03:08.230
You need to fix the place up.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.733
Reinvent The Clam's image
and we'll help you.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.277
That'll take forever.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.697

PETER: Boy, I do not envy
whoever has to clean that mess up.

03:52.649 --> 03:56.236
Brian, why don't you take Stewie
while Meg and I go clothes shopping?

03:56.612 --> 04:00.115
You know, it's awfully dangerous for me to
be walking around the mall at my height.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.910
-I say, let me get on your back.
-Oh, for God's sake.

-That is why you fail.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.540
What about this, Meg?

04:08.624 --> 04:11.251
A pink baby tee that says "Little Slut?"

04:11.335 --> 04:14.838
-That seems pretty hip.
-I don't know if that's really me, Mom.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.965
Well, they've got one that says
"Porn Star"...

04:17.049 --> 04:20.594
and another that says "Sperm Dumpster"
and they're all written in glitter.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.804
All right. All right.
Give me "Sperm Dumpster."

04:22.888 --> 04:24.223

-Nope, just really small.

Tricia Takanawa...

is handing out makeovers.

we could think of and everything's failed.

Especially that Coyote Ugly theme.

you were beautiful just the way you...

something, too.

entertained a bunch of drunken idiots...

12:47.059 --> 12:51.313
But I wanna be without a care

12:52.272 --> 12:57.027
Unicorns and butterflies everywhere

13:02.616 --> 13:06.662
Gonna buy me a rainbow

13:08.539 --> 13:13.377
Gonna wrap it up in a great big bow

13:14.253 --> 13:17.297
The time is right
It's day, not night

13:17.381 --> 13:21.468
Just open up your heart
It'll be all right

13:23.303 --> 13:27.057
Gonna buy me a rainbow

13:27.641 --> 13:29.434
Buy me a rainbow

13:36.567 --> 13:39.403
You guys were great.
My name's Jimmy Iovine.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.864
And I'd like to make you
filthy rich rock stars.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.824
Wow, you're the chairman of
Interscope Records.

13:43.907 --> 13:47.160
-What're you doing in prison?
-I stomped a cat to death.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.121
Listen, you guys got talent.

13:49.204 --> 13:52.583
-Well, where do we sign?
-Right here, on Tony's butt cheek.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.627
And initial here...

13:56.628 --> 13:57.629
and here.

13:58.714 --> 13:59.798
And date.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.135
Oh, crap. Today's the seventeenth.

14:08.056 --> 14:12.060
[Singing] Gonna buy me a rainbow

14:12.436 --> 14:13.896
Buy me a rainbow

14:17.691 --> 14:20.736
-How was that, Dr. Ditty?
-Yo, that sounds smooth, y'all.

14:20.819 --> 14:21.820
I just have a--

14:23.947 --> 14:26.700
God, I'm so sorry. I keep doing that.

14:26.783 --> 14:27.868
God, please forgive me.

14:27.951 --> 14:31.330
I get that from my father.
He's from a different generation.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.540
-It's--
-Whatever, man.

14:33.624 --> 14:37.169
-We cool? We good?
-Yeah, we're cool. Fine.

14:38.587 --> 14:42.633
Mr. Doctor? If you get shot
in a rap feud...

14:42.716 --> 14:44.801
can you perform surgery on yourself?

14:44.885 --> 14:47.971
Well, no, Chris. My degree's in optometry.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.056
All right, Dr. Ditty.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.183
I got three choices for you
for the name of the band:

14:51.266 --> 14:55.229
Peter Griffin Starship,
Peter Griffin and the Sunday Steppers...

14:55.312 --> 14:57.397
or Testicular Sound Express.

14:57.481 --> 14:59.441
I think the name is Meg.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.652
-Me? Why?
-Yeah, why?

15:01.735 --> 15:03.278
Let me explain
something to you, all right?

15:03.362 --> 15:07.199
We got to get her half-naked
and put her out front, center stage.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.326
And that's gonna make
y'all billionaires...

15:09.409 --> 15:13.080
because America loves
hot, white jailbait ass.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.414
Wait a minute.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.459
That's the smartest thing
I've ever heard...

15:17.543 --> 15:19.753
anyone say about anything.

15:20.003 --> 15:23.006
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Meg
being exploited that way.

15:23.090 --> 15:26.218
Shut up, Mom, it's not your decision.
I want to be exploited.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.512
Meg, don't you talk to me like that.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.723
Look, Lois, I love Meal Ticket
just as much as I love Chris and Stevie...

15:31.807 --> 15:34.935
but business is business.
So, let's get this show on the road, huh?

15:35.018 --> 15:36.895
Good. Now, I just need you to sign this.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.649
Oh, God. Sorry.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.484
Oh, my God. That is not me.

15:42.568 --> 15:44.403
That's not who I am. I vote Democrat.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.406
It will not happen again.
We cool? We good?

15:50.158 --> 15:51.326
You...

15:51.410 --> 15:53.954
You guys know I have no problem
with black people, right?

15:54.037 --> 15:56.123
Yeah. Sure.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.500
You did say you hated Crooklyn.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.939
-Hey, Doc, you got a minute?
-What you want, dog?

16:21.023 --> 16:23.275
Yeah, so, hey, check it out.

16:23.358 --> 16:26.612
Stewie and I have been working
on some stuff of our own.

16:26.695 --> 16:29.865
And we thought there might be a place
for us to sing on the next album.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.410
Hey, cool. You're busy. No sweat.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.165
Boy, Benson was a funny show.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.921
-I'll talk to you later.
-Well, what did he say?

16:44.004 --> 16:46.256
He said he'd think about it.
Okay, so where were we?

16:46.632 --> 16:47.633
Okay.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.928
[Singing] I want to have intercourse
with you

16:52.346 --> 16:54.640
Intercourse with you

16:54.723 --> 16:56.016
Relations.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.977
Intercourse with you

16:59.061 --> 17:00.646
-Right?
-Yeah. No, great, that sounds good.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.397
All right, groovy.

17:02.481 --> 17:04.566
Now, is there a shorter word
for intercourse?

17:04.650 --> 17:06.902
Lois, go grab me another bag of Skittles.

17:06.985 --> 17:09.905
-Excuse me, young lady?
-Did I freaking stutter?

17:09.988 --> 17:13.909
-I said more Skittles.
-All right. That is it, Meg.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.619
You know, ever since you
got that makeover...

17:15.702 --> 17:17.663
you've developed a terrible attitude.

17:17.746 --> 17:20.624
And all the success with the family band
is only making it worse.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.960
The family band?

17:23.252 --> 17:27.047
You know, maybe you haven't noticed,
Lois, but I am the band.

17:27.130 --> 17:31.134
-Right, Missus Wong?
-Yeah, she band. Old lady jealous.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.972
Peter, we have to do something.
We're losing our daughter.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.723
I'm worried about
what's happening to her.

17:36.807 --> 17:38.684
Lois, this is the kind of thing...

17:38.767 --> 17:41.687
that always resolves itself
if you just ignore it, all right?

17:41.770 --> 17:44.731
What's more important is
we're living the sweet life.

17:44.815 --> 17:47.359
This is even more fun than
when I performed at the White House.

17:47.442 --> 17:50.112
Mr. President,
I present to you Peter Griffin.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.547
Okay, listen up, everybody.
I got great news.

18:08.630 --> 18:12.968
Meg, you and your family are gonna
perform on Saturday Night Live.

18:13.427 --> 18:16.346
You mean I'm gonna get to meet
John Belushi and Gilda Radner...

18:16.430 --> 18:19.683
and Phil Hartman, and Chris Farley,
and Horatio Sanz? Sweet!

18:24.313 --> 18:26.148
Saturday Night Live.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.859
I can't think of anything more exciting.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.486
Oh, my God, a water fountain!

18:34.740 --> 18:38.243
Meg, I'm Jimmy Fallon.

18:38.327 --> 18:41.455
It's great to finally meet you.
I'm hosting.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.791
Why don't you come hang out
in my dressing room?

18:44.875 --> 18:46.835
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

18:46.919 --> 18:48.837
Come on, let's go.

18:49.046 --> 18:52.382
Peter, I'm worried about Meg.
She's spiraling out of control.

18:52.466 --> 18:54.551
I mean, what if she develops
a coke problem?

18:54.635 --> 18:55.761
No Coke. Pepsi.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.932
Come on, you set me up for that one.

19:03.936 --> 19:04.978
Wow, Jimmy.

19:05.062 --> 19:07.898
That was everything
Ladies Home Journal said it would be.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.150
Awesome, great, thanks.

19:10.901 --> 19:12.569
You know, there's something I...

19:13.362 --> 19:14.905
There's something I gotta tell you.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.408
Being with you just made me feel
so... Live from New York...

19:18.492 --> 19:20.536
it's Saturday Night!

19:21.578 --> 19:23.830
TV HOST: It's Saturday Night Live.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.624
Oh, my God.

19:25.707 --> 19:27.918
Yeah, that wasn't a very good
opening sketch, was it?

19:28.001 --> 19:31.088
-A rare miss.
-I don't think that was a sketch, Peter.

19:31.922 --> 19:35.050
Mom, Dad, he used me for comedy.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.176
Wait a minute.

19:36.260 --> 19:38.595
Are you telling me
that my daughter was deflowered...

19:38.679 --> 19:40.973
in front of one-and-a-half times
the Mad TV audience?

19:41.390 --> 19:42.599
My poor baby.

19:42.683 --> 19:44.351
My God, Lois, you were right.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.311
Why the hell didn't I see it coming?

19:46.395 --> 19:50.899
All right, stand aside.
It's about time I did my fatherly duty.

19:51.483 --> 19:54.027
I said "duty," but no time
to laugh about it now.

19:56.071 --> 19:58.365
Hey, everybody, it's great to be back.

19:58.574 --> 20:00.617
So we got a great show tonight and--

20:00.701 --> 20:03.161
Hey, Fallon, say goodnight, you bum.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.748
And this is for laughing
and looking at the camera...

20:06.832 --> 20:08.667
during every sketch you've ever been in.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.794
Who do you think you are? Carol Burnett?

20:10.878 --> 20:13.088
You think because she did it,
it's okay for you?

20:13.589 --> 20:15.924
You haven't earned what she's earned,
buddy.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.594
All right, now where's the guy
who slept with my daughter?

20:20.929 --> 20:23.140
I'm so glad to be the real me again.

20:23.307 --> 20:25.434
It's too much work being beautiful.

20:25.517 --> 20:28.270
Not for me, but it's good
to have you back, pumpkin.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.939
Well, I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

20:36.111 --> 20:38.530
Listen, thanks, everybody.
I had a great time tonight.

20:38.614 --> 20:41.366
I want to thank Jimmy Fallon
for being such a good sport.

20:41.950 --> 20:46.121
Lois, Meg, Stewie, Brian, Chris,
the guys from the prison...

20:46.538 --> 20:47.706
Counting Crows.

20:48.332 --> 20:50.709
If I'm forgetting anybody, I'm sorry.
Goodnight, everybody!

20:50.792 --> 20:52.544
Our thoughts are with you, Chevy!

20:57.799 --> 21:00.802
TV HOST: From the world famous
Apollo Theater in Harlem...

21:00.886 --> 21:03.055
it's show time at the--

21:04.306 --> 21:06.058
What? I'm tired.

21:06.558 --> 21:08.810
It has nothing to do with the fact
that it's a black show.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.522
What? I can't be tired at 1:00
in the morning?

21:12.022 --> 21:13.482
[Barking]
