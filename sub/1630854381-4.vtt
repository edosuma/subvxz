19:30.503 --> 19:32.505
Biologist?

19:32.539 --> 19:34.106
No, the other Marine.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.975
I just thought,
for once, it'd be nice

19:36.008 --> 19:37.710
to be someone
that people look up to.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.347
But my dad always told me
the Marines don't take losers.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.014
So this morning I went down
to the recruiting office

19:42.048 --> 19:43.216
and I signed up.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.885
The only thing is,
I'm 17,

19:45.918 --> 19:48.054
so I need you to sign this
so I can enlist.

19:48.087 --> 19:51.123
Well, hold on. What --
What about you living with us?

19:51.157 --> 19:53.526
What about you
going to college?

19:53.560 --> 19:54.961
I wanted to help you.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.796
You already did.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.898
But I wanted it
to take longer.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.336
Hey. What's up?

20:03.370 --> 20:06.473
I told Caleb he could do
anything, and now he's doing it.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.442
I mean, I want
what's best for him,

20:09.476 --> 20:12.845
but he says he -- he thinks
he wants to join the military,

20:12.879 --> 20:14.781
like, right away,
and so...

20:14.814 --> 20:16.383
Okay!
I thought
you'd probably w--

20:17.917 --> 20:20.052
Kid's got a good head on
his shoulders. I support him.

20:20.086 --> 20:23.390
...take a few minutes to --
Ohh.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.458
This isn't fair.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.827
I just got you.

20:27.860 --> 20:31.964
I'll send you a bumper sticker
that says "My Son is a Marine."

20:31.998 --> 20:34.367
Well.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.003
That would
make me proud.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.505
Thank you!
Yeah.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.907
I'm gonna get this down
to the recruiting office now.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.611
[ Door opens and closes ]
Oh...

20:44.644 --> 20:47.914
You only had a day, but you
did a great job raising him.
Yeah.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.452
By the way, did you
take my wedding ring

20:52.485 --> 20:53.920
to the jewelers, too?

20:54.854 --> 20:57.223
[ Chuckles ]
Son of a bitch.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.463
Call!
Let's see 'em!

21:03.496 --> 21:04.331
Alright. I've been
waiting for this moment.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.532
Read 'em and

21:05.565 --> 21:08.701
weep...the hell?!

21:08.735 --> 21:11.371
You know, Becky, it's not enough
to pull a bill out of the jar.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.705
You have to pay it, too.

21:12.739 --> 21:15.775
I put it back in the jar
so somebody else would pull it.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.943
Let's just call it a night.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.145
No, no! Guys! Guys!
No! Come here! Hey!

21:19.178 --> 21:22.114
Hey. Look. I got a-a --
I got a light on my phone!

21:22.148 --> 21:23.282
I got a light! See?

21:23.316 --> 21:24.617
Guys, come on!

21:24.651 --> 21:26.185
I got four kings!
