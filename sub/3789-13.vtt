01:11.280 --> 01:13.573
The question you've gotta ask yourself, E,

01:13.657 --> 01:16.325
- is are we family?
- Yeah, E, are we family?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.494
What are we if we're not family?

01:18.579 --> 01:21.497
Just four guys who are a little old
to still be living together.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.249
Yeah, and one guy who's way too old.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.417
Just share the wealth.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.210
You made $200,000 off Aquaman.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.920
With another $300,000 coming in.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.381
- That is good money.
- Meanwhile, me and Turtle,

01:30.466 --> 01:31.924
we're living beneath the poverty line.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.844
In the old country everybody
gets a taste off a big score.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.929
- I'm Irish, Turtle.
- Well, I'm not.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.931
And this broke Guinea wants
to wet his beak a little.

01:39.016 --> 01:42.351
A quarterback takes care of
his offensive line after a good season.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.686
You know that, E.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.272
Otherwise, they let him
get buried the next year.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.441
I feel like I'm getting buried this year.

01:49.485 --> 01:52.028
You better forget gold and
check out something in silver, Drama.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.405
No, bro. Silver doesn't read on my skin.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.157
What does that watch cost? $10,000?

01:56.241 --> 01:58.326
You wish. This is gold, E.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.287
Saigon is gonna love this beast.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.122
- Saigon?
- Yeah.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.708
I've got to get something for my client
to welcome him to my company.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.752
You think I'm buying a watch
for your fucking client?

02:07.836 --> 02:10.003
No, you're paying for a gift for me.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.507
What I chose to do with it after that,
that's my business.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.509
- Vince?
- Family, E.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.010
Family.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.055
All right, fuck it.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.266
Miss, can you give these guys
whatever they want?

02:22.351 --> 02:24.018
Spread it out over all of these.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.813
So much for paying off my student loans.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.190
- I'll be outside.
Told you he wasn't cheap.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.609
Had you all wrong, E.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.653
Yeah, E, you're good people.
- What?

02:33.737 --> 02:35.404
I don't have to buy the watches?

02:35.489 --> 02:37.782
No, I'm buying.
I just told them that you would have.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.534
Phew. Thank God!

02:39.618 --> 02:41.202
Thanks.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.746
- Can I wear mine out, bro?
- Of course, Johnny.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.414
- Me too?
- Yeah.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.999
Yeah.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.754
It's 7:35 A.M. In Senegal...

02:51.839 --> 02:53.214
That's great, Drama.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.091
...and 7:53 in Tikrit.

02:55.634 --> 02:58.511
Minutes don't change, Drama. Only the hour.

02:58.971 --> 03:02.139
- Yeah, like you've ever been to Tikrit.
- Holy shit!

03:02.224 --> 03:04.016
- What?
- Look!

03:04.101 --> 03:05.351
Is that Mandy?

03:05.435 --> 03:07.019
You've got to be shitting me.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.729
She's stepping out on baby bro!

03:08.814 --> 03:10.690
Relax! Don't jump to any conclusions.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.275
Maybe they ran into each other in there.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.819
And they just happen
to be leaving together?

03:14.903 --> 03:15.987
Yeah, that's what happens at Gucci,

03:16.071 --> 03:19.365
buy a pair of shoes,
and they let you fuck your ex-fiancÃ©.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.075
Come on, Turtle, let's trail them!

03:21.159 --> 03:22.702
Come on, come on!

03:23.036 --> 03:26.539
What should I tell Vince?
- You're representation. Lie!

03:26.623 --> 03:27.957
Let's go!

03:30.377 --> 03:31.794
Where did they go?

03:31.879 --> 03:34.255
Turtle had to meet with Saigon.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.550
I thought today was gonna be a leisure day.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.640
Thank you.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.811
- They started without you.
- Ha ha, very funny.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.771
Mr. McQuewick is in there.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.523
What is this? April Fools?

03:54.109 --> 03:55.401
Never been in better shape.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.737
I think we have more A-list clients now

03:57.821 --> 03:59.989
than we've ever had before.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.742
Ah, Ari. Good of you to join us.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.120
When did the rules change, though?

04:06.204 --> 04:08.414
I'm not sure what rule you're referring to,

04:08.498 --> 04:10.917
but I'm sure there have been
some slight adjustments

04:11.001 --> 04:13.669
in the three years
since you last attended a staff meeting.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.714
Well, nobody's ever been allowed
to enter a staff meeting late.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.091
No one.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.010
No exceptions.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.179
Move along, Ari.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.529
Back off a little. You're too close.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.448
I'm two cars back.
What do you want?

04:42.532 --> 04:46.327
Always keep two-fifths of a block
between you and your subject.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.330
Oh, what, have you done this before, Drama?

04:49.414 --> 04:51.415
Too many times, Turtle.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.167
Too many times.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.128
I'm thinking about taking a trip to Paris.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.463
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.632
I've got a week before shooting starts.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.134
It's six months of hell after that.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.136
- Yeah.
- I could use a trip.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.930
I'll tell the boys.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.557
No, not with the boys. With Mandy.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.235
What the fuck are you taking pictures of?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.903
What do you mean? Them.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.156
This way when Vince
goes into denial about it,

05:24.241 --> 05:26.575
- it's proof.
- You don't think he'll believe us?

05:27.327 --> 05:30.287
Nobody ever wants to believe
you're being two-timed, Turtle.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.458
How many times you been cheated on?

05:34.543 --> 05:35.960
Too many, Turtle.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.212
Too many.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.674
Mr. McQuewick's on the phone.
He'd like to speak with you.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.260
To apologize? Send him down.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.178
He wants you to come up.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.597
- He won't come down?
- He asked me to send you up.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.099
He asked you to send me up.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.852
Did you tell him
that you don't send me anywhere?

05:52.936 --> 05:57.064
Did you tell him that no one sends me
anywhere in this fucking agency?

05:57.149 --> 05:59.692
Did you tell him
that I send myself where I want?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.527
No. I just said okay.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.154
You tell him to come down.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.625
He'd like to speak with you.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.005
You see that, Lloyd? No surrender.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.470
Terrance, how are you?

06:27.554 --> 06:28.971
Ari, get your ass up here!

06:30.474 --> 06:32.516
You embarrassed me in front of my troops.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.061
Rules are rules.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.646
I apologize.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.523
I appreciate that.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.734
- Now, come up!
- You come down.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.030
Conference room, neutral territory.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.199
- 1:15.
- Done.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.620
How about you and Sloan
come with us?

06:52.704 --> 06:54.622
- To Paris?
- Yeah.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.791
You guys are getting pretty serious, right?

06:56.875 --> 06:59.627
I don't know. You know, maybe.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.713
What if this is it for both of us?

07:03.840 --> 07:06.467
I think it's a little early for that for both of us.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.677
Yeah? Maybe, maybe not.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.263
Anyway, it's never too early to go to Paris.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.848
That's true.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.311
- Yo!
We followed them all morning.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.437
Great!

07:18.522 --> 07:20.648
Don't worry. They didn't suspect a thing.

07:20.732 --> 07:23.025
I'm dropping Vince off at Mandy's now, guys.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.027
Good! She just arrived home.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.154
- Where are you?
Look to your left.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.035
- Was that our car?
- I've gotta go.

07:35.372 --> 07:36.705
It's clear.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.415
That was close.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.628
Thanks.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.382
Think about Paris.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.011
What's up, baby?
- Hey.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.640
- Where were you?
- I was just shopping with my mom.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.975
Yeah?

07:57.227 --> 07:59.186
- Hey, E!
- Hey!

07:59.271 --> 08:01.313
- How's Sloan?
- She's great.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.024
- Tell her I said hi, okay?
- Yeah, definitely.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.317
Bye.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.530
I mean, she lied right to his face.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.867
Eric, Mandy dated Chris for three years.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.952
That's a long history.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.663
Maybe they were just talking,

08:17.747 --> 08:20.499
and she didn't tell Vince because
she didn't want to hurt his feelings.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.002
- You don't know the whole story.
- I know what I saw.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.504
- What did you see?
- The way they were walking.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.173
What do you mean
the way they were walking?

08:27.257 --> 08:29.633
Just their body language.
Stop looking at me like that.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.260
- I'm telling you.
- Telling me what?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.679
You have some unique skill
I don't know about?

08:33.763 --> 08:34.889
Maybe.

08:35.222 --> 08:36.222
Hmm.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.475
What does my body language say?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.729
That we might not
be making it out to lunch today.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.313
Eric, listen to me.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.482
My best friend in high school, when I told her

08:45.567 --> 08:47.318
that I thought that her boyfriend
was cheating on her,

08:47.402 --> 08:48.611
she never spoke to me again.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.070
Was he?

08:50.155 --> 08:51.322
Mmm-hmm.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.115
Didn't matter.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.326
Still I've got to tell him, though.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.204
- It sucks getting cheated on.
- Yeah, it does.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.497
So, let's agree
we'll never do that to each other

09:00.582 --> 09:02.708
if we ever get serious.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.211
Oh, okay, if we ever get serious.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.465
Did I totally just freak you out?

09:09.549 --> 09:10.925
No, of course not.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.635
I want to get serious. Come here.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.102
Hold on a second.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.356
It's Ari. This could be important.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.565
Hello?

09:26.650 --> 09:28.067
ARl: Let me ask you something.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.402
- You still seeing Sloan?
- Yeah. Why?

09:30.487 --> 09:32.488
She ever say anything to you about me?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.823
About you? Why would
she say something about you?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.784
I don't mean it like that. I mean, work-wise.

09:36.868 --> 09:37.993
No.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.079
E, you're my friend. You'd tell me if she did.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.331
Ari, I'm at Sloan's.
Do you want me to ask her something?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.417
You're with her now?
Why the fuck didn't you say so?

09:45.502 --> 09:46.877
No, I don't want you to asking her anything.

09:46.962 --> 09:50.339
I don't want you to say anything about this.
Forget this conversation.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.800
Does she already know
we're having this conversation?

09:52.884 --> 09:54.927
Ari, what's going on?
- Nothing. It's all good.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.428
I'll call you back.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.224
What's going on?

10:00.308 --> 10:02.518
I think Ari and your father
are having problems.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.106
All right, let's cut to the chase.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.108
- All right.
- I miss this place.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.694
I miss the excitement. I miss the action.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.405
I'm coming back full-time.

10:14.906 --> 10:17.950
Muhammad Ali came back
once too often too, Terrance.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.743
Stop, Ari.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.662
This is nothing for you to worry about.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.290
Good. All right then, I want an extension.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.709
Well, you have a year left on your deal.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.545
When it expires, as always,

10:29.629 --> 10:31.880
- you'll be taken care of.
- That's not good enough.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.508
I want to know that
I'm being taken care of right now.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.886
You know I have a policy
never to extend active contracts,

10:38.555 --> 10:41.515
but I've always been fair with you.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.101
You were being fair with me
when you said you were leaving.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.770
You coming back now is not fair to me.

10:46.855 --> 10:47.855
Not now!

10:47.939 --> 10:50.232
Now I want something, Terrance.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.609
All right. All right, Ari.

10:54.195 --> 10:57.489
You know, I've never done this before.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.878
This is what I'm prepared to offer you.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.681
No e-mails, no faxes,
no phone calls, no nothing.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.558
- Simply silence, Lloyd.
- Ari.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.686
Silence, Lloyd. It's golden.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.495
- Who's gonna lead this thing?
- I told you, I am.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.246
You guys don't even need to be here.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.041
- I'm his brother, E.
- Yeah, and I'm his best friend.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.085
- Is that official?
- What?

11:51.169 --> 11:53.796
I always thought that
me, you and Vince were best friends.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.174
I didn't know that you two
were better friends than me and him.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.885
Or that you and him
are better friends than me and you.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.804
Whatever, Turtle.
You want to tell him, tell him.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.889
No, the guy always kills the messenger,

12:03.973 --> 12:05.766
never kills the best friend of the messenger.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.559
- Yo!
- What's up, brother?

12:07.644 --> 12:09.561
All right, what's the emergency?

12:09.646 --> 12:12.147
You see, there's one head right there.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.816
And there's another one right there.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.943
- I don't see anything.
- Right there.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.195
If you look straight down you can almost see

12:18.279 --> 12:20.489
that there's two hands
that are almost holding.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.742
This thing's really not designed
for long-range photography.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.369
Anyway, who is it?

12:28.915 --> 12:31.083
Come on, guys. Who the fuck is it?

12:31.167 --> 12:32.584
It's Mandy and Chris.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.045
We saw them together this morning.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.755
This morning?
We were together this morning.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.924
Before that. You were paying for the watches.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.760
Which we didn't get a chance
to thank you for, by the way.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.178
Thanks, Vince!

12:45.014 --> 12:46.849
- Where you going?
Gonna call her.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.355
Lloyd!

12:53.857 --> 12:55.858
Mmm.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.451
This envelope contains
the names of eight agents.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.911
Anyone catches you, you eat it. Comprende?

13:07.996 --> 13:09.788
Nod if you understand what I'm saying.

13:09.873 --> 13:10.998
I understand.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.292
You can't just fucking nod?

13:13.376 --> 13:14.793
Lloyd...

13:16.045 --> 13:17.504
I want you to

13:17.589 --> 13:19.965
pledge your undying loyalty to me.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.384
- Ari...
- Listen, Lloyd, do you want to make it

13:22.469 --> 13:24.428
or do you want to fold shirts
at a Chinese laundry?

13:24.512 --> 13:26.054
Now pledge.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.017
- I pledge my undying loyalty to you.
- Okay.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.144
Now, I want you to go to each of these agents,

13:32.228 --> 13:36.398
discreetly say the words "tsetse fly. "

13:38.526 --> 13:39.985
Say nothing else.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.695
Now, go.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.616
- Ari, are you leaving the agency?
- Shh!

13:45.700 --> 13:48.911
Silence is fucking golden.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.837
- It's all good.
- How so?

13:58.922 --> 14:01.757
They were just talking.
She didn't want to hurt my feelings.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.842
Come on, guys. I get it.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.761
They were gonna get married next week.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.262
Anyway, I'm gonna go the bathroom.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.805
Are you gonna drive me
to her house afterwards?

14:08.890 --> 14:10.265
Sure.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.059
Denial, stage one.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.853
We ought to go over
to Chris's house and whup his ass.

14:14.938 --> 14:15.938
Yeah.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.357
Guys, remember,
Vince took Mandy from Chris.

14:18.441 --> 14:21.151
- He should whup Vince's ass.
- Who's side you on?

14:21.236 --> 14:22.945
I'm just saying, what if it was nothing?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.738
They rented movies at Blockbuster.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.782
Maybe they were returning movies
they already had.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.161
- Is that what you think, E?
- No.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.163
- It's not what I think.
- Yeah, me neither.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.207
- Come on, Turtle, let's go.
- Where?

14:35.291 --> 14:36.875
Go get the proof we need. Come on.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.628
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't you worry about it.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.881
Where are they going?

14:42.966 --> 14:44.466
Another Saigon meeting.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.969
You know how hard it is
to get a rapper to sign a contract.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.556
Those fuckers never say goodbye.

14:52.809 --> 14:57.020
Tsetse fly.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.314
Tsetse fly.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.441
Hamburger Hamlet, right?

15:02.735 --> 15:05.028
Tsetse fly, Davies.
That's all that you're supposed to say.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.738
- Everything else stays the same.
- I'm sorry.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.074
- I forgot what it means.
- Well, you just said it.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.742
- The Hamlet?
- Yes.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.829
Right, the Hamlet.
Nobody who works in this business

15:13.913 --> 15:15.914
- would ever be caught dead there.
- You know what?

15:15.999 --> 15:18.333
You better lock down
some really good clients.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.509
Look, if you have something to say,

15:27.594 --> 15:28.844
why don't you just say it?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.054
Look, when you guys told me you thought

15:31.139 --> 15:33.056
Kristen was cheating on me, it hurt,
but you were right.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.100
Now you're comparing Mandy to Kristen?

15:35.184 --> 15:37.060
No! I'm not even saying she's cheating.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.812
Then what are you saying?

15:39.480 --> 15:43.066
I'm just saying
it didn't look like it was over to me.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.902
- What do you mean? They were kissing?
- No.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.571
- Were they holding hands?
- No.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.448
Then what made it look like it wasn't over?

15:49.532 --> 15:52.784
- I don't know. Instinct.
- Whatever.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.455
- You asked me what I was thinking.
- Now you told me,

15:56.539 --> 15:58.790
and I don't want to hear about it again, okay?

15:58.875 --> 16:00.250
Okay.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.048
You think you got enough cash?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.426
Live and learn.
You throw around enough dough,

16:09.510 --> 16:11.428
you can find out anything you want.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.221
What exactly are we trying to find out?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.973
We already know they rented a movie.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.683
Yeah, but what movie?

16:16.768 --> 16:19.478
Texas Chainsaw Massacre
might say one thing.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.856
Nine 1/2 Weeks would say
something very different.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.027
There is no way I can tell you
what movie Mandy Moore rented.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.112
I would get fired.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.407
Are you joking?

16:33.076 --> 16:34.326
There's more where that came from.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.912
I value my job. I cannot be bought.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.958
Psst!

16:43.836 --> 16:46.254
- You're Vinnie Chase's brother, right?
- That's right.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.799
Yeah, I saw you on Celebrity Justice.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.884
You busted up that guy's car with a golf club.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.719
That was on CJ?

16:52.804 --> 16:54.471
- Yeah.
- Sweet!

16:54.555 --> 16:56.682
You got anything to tell us?

16:57.809 --> 16:59.476
Break out that money clip again
and I just might.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.854
Just tell me what this is about, Ari.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.522
I just want to have a private dinner

17:04.607 --> 17:06.358
with you and Vince as soon as possible.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.193
To discuss what? You're freaking me out!

17:08.277 --> 17:10.362
There's no need to freak out, E.

17:10.445 --> 17:12.030
It's all good. Believe me.

17:12.115 --> 17:15.075
Just think of it as a State of the Union address
for all my A-listers.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.828
Hold on. Yeah?

17:17.912 --> 17:19.788
Code red, Ari! Code red!

17:19.872 --> 17:22.582
- What are you talking about?
- He knows! He knows!

17:22.666 --> 17:24.417
- Who knows what?
- Mr. McQuewick.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.505
I think you're the first one to arrive.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.468
Oh, fuck!

17:36.806 --> 17:38.515
Lloyd, pack up all my files.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.559
Pile everything you see into a box.
Everything!

17:40.643 --> 17:42.644
You see a used condom,
an executioner's mask,

17:42.729 --> 17:44.229
and a goddamn spiked paddle,

17:44.313 --> 17:46.481
don't think, just pack that bitch! Chop suey!

17:52.488 --> 17:54.698
Ernesto! Keep it up front

17:54.782 --> 17:56.616
and keep it running!

18:04.333 --> 18:06.293
- Ari, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.628
- Sorry, Ari.
- Don't sweat it, Peter.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.630
- It's too bad, Ari.
- It's all right, man.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.924
- Sorry, bro.
- It's okay. It ain't your fault.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.634
You should be a nicer person.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.804
Maybe then people wouldn't fuck you.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.598
You talked, Davies?

18:21.017 --> 18:22.768
- Hey, Adam.
- Yeah, Ari?

18:22.852 --> 18:24.436
Just so you know, your girlfriend,

18:24.520 --> 18:26.938
when she was in the mailroom,
she offered to blow me.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.607
True story.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.877
People, we have a traitor in our midst.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.505
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.466
You're making a very big mistake, Terrance.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.552
That's what Arthur Jensen said in 1973.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.806
He was the first conspirator
that I ever dealt with.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.808
Try finding him now, Ari.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.602
He's selling auto insurance in Reseda.

19:06.187 --> 19:09.147
Okay, people, most of you are sitting there

19:09.232 --> 19:11.399
and you're looking
at this good-looking old man

19:11.484 --> 19:13.819
and you're wondering, "Who the fuck is he?"

19:13.903 --> 19:16.822
And you know what?
That's exactly what you should be doing.

19:16.906 --> 19:20.158
You all know who's been running
this company for the past eight years.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.828
And you all know that when I go,

19:22.912 --> 19:27.207
in no time you will be repping nobodys
like Bill from The Apprentice.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.668
No one needs to make a decision right now.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.837
I will be starting my own agency.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.589
Two very important goals will apply,

19:34.674 --> 19:36.591
to make everyone who is in

19:36.676 --> 19:39.928
at the ground floor rich, and to burn

19:40.012 --> 19:42.472
this motherfucking place to the ground!

19:42.557 --> 19:44.558
Lloyd, are you with me?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.028
Lloyd, what are you doing?

19:57.113 --> 19:59.781
You and me have a special bond.
Come on, let's go.

20:01.909 --> 20:05.912
Ari, swear to me
that you will never again say anything

20:05.997 --> 20:09.207
offensive to me
about my race or sexual orientation.

20:09.292 --> 20:10.667
I can't swear to that,

20:10.751 --> 20:13.670
but I promise I will always apologize after.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.897
Phone numbers, messages,
anything you remember, write it down.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.607
Get Shauna Roberts, have her start

20:33.691 --> 20:37.402
drafting a press release
for tomorrow's Variety, all right?

20:37.486 --> 20:38.862
Ernesto!

20:39.363 --> 20:40.739
Where's my fucking car?

20:40.823 --> 20:42.282
I'll get him.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.368
You kidding me?

20:46.662 --> 20:48.246
My phone's dead!

20:48.331 --> 20:50.749
Company phone. I think they had it turned off.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.294
Hello?

20:54.378 --> 20:56.713
It's Lloyd looking for Mr. Gold's car.

20:56.797 --> 21:00.258
Sorry, Lloyd, it's a company car.
Mr. McQuewick said I can't give it to him.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.177
Can't give it to me?

21:04.847 --> 21:07.474
Ernesto, how many fucking pesos

21:07.558 --> 21:09.267
did I give you for Christmas?

21:09.352 --> 21:12.103
Huh, Ernesto?
Every Christmas for the past decade?

21:12.188 --> 21:16.608
Half of Mexico
is eating on my tips that I have given you.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.945
Bring my motherfucking car now, por favor!

21:20.029 --> 21:22.030
Sorry, Mr. Gold, I can't do it.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.574
Oh, and Mr. Gold, I'm from Guatemala,

21:24.659 --> 21:26.785
and our currency is the quetzal.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.536
I'll get my car.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.540
Fuck!

21:34.210 --> 21:37.712
Fuck!

21:39.048 --> 21:41.466
They rented Brian's Song, E.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.301
I heard you. What do you want me to do?

21:43.386 --> 21:45.887
- The ultimate guy-cry movie.
- Uh-huh.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.640
He cries in front of her,
shows her he's sensitive.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.058
Bang! He moves right in.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.644
Yeah, his tears
will basically act as a lubricant.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.397
We said our piece.
There's nothing more we can do.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.025
How's that chicken?

22:07.910 --> 22:09.953
Okay, so, you're mad at me?

22:11.163 --> 22:12.414
No. I'm not mad at you.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.915
I guess I should have told you.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.835
- I'm sorry.
- Well, if there's something to tell...

22:16.919 --> 22:19.004
No. Again, nothing happened.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.339
Chris and I haven't been together

22:21.424 --> 22:22.882
since we've been together.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.426
He just...

22:24.844 --> 22:27.303
You know, he begged to see me today.
That's all.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.347
What did he say?

22:32.226 --> 22:33.893
That he still loved me

22:33.978 --> 22:37.397
and he wanted to make sure that me and you

22:37.481 --> 22:39.566
weren't just trying to recapture first love,

22:39.650 --> 22:42.736
but if I was sure, then he was happy for me.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.196
Yeah.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.448
Are you sure?

22:49.952 --> 22:53.496
How can I be sure?
It's been, what, two weeks?

22:53.581 --> 22:55.331
Well, I'm sure.

22:55.416 --> 22:56.791
Really?

22:57.877 --> 23:00.003
Huh.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.049
Because

23:05.009 --> 23:07.635
I'm sorry. I'm not, Vince.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.554
I'm not sure.

23:11.432 --> 23:14.142
I'm just... I'm really confused. I can't lie.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.228
Because on one hand, I think about you

23:17.313 --> 23:20.356
and the way that you make me feel

23:21.025 --> 23:23.151
and how I felt five years ago.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.488
And then on the other hand,

23:26.572 --> 23:28.531
I think about him and...

23:32.328 --> 23:33.578
I kind of miss him.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.085
Why don't you just be honest with me

23:40.169 --> 23:42.712
and tell me which hand
you're leaning towards?

23:48.427 --> 23:49.511
His.

23:54.809 --> 23:57.435
I'm sorry.

24:02.900 --> 24:03.983
Wow.

24:04.068 --> 24:07.112
I'd like to say a few words about a guy I know,

24:07.196 --> 24:08.863
a friend of mine.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.574
His name is Brian Piccolo.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.246
He has a mental attitude

24:16.330 --> 24:18.456
which makes me proud to have a friend

24:18.541 --> 24:22.377
who spells out courage 24 hours a day,

24:22.461 --> 24:24.337
every day of his life.

24:25.756 --> 24:26.965
I can't get Ari on the phone.

24:27.049 --> 24:29.092
- It says his cell's been disconnected.
- Shut up!

24:29.176 --> 24:30.969
- Move.
- You guys have any idea where Vince

24:31.053 --> 24:33.429
- might have his home number?
- No. Shut up!

24:33.514 --> 24:35.682
- Move!
Call the agency.

24:35.766 --> 24:38.601
There's got to be
a night answering service.

24:38.686 --> 24:40.937
But I say to you, here and now,

24:41.522 --> 24:43.523
Brian Piccolo is the man of courage...

24:43.607 --> 24:46.151
Hi, can you put me through
to Ari Gold's voicemail?

24:46.235 --> 24:48.736
Sorry, but I'm afraid
Mr. Gold no longer works here.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.865
Okay, thank you.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.745
I loved Brian Piccolo.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.501
They said he no longer works there.

25:05.629 --> 25:06.713
Hey, Vince.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.675
Can I get you to turn off the TV?

25:10.759 --> 25:12.844
Come on, Vince, it's the best part.

25:18.601 --> 25:19.851
All right, just to get it over with,

25:19.935 --> 25:22.478
so we don't have to talk about it again.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.147
You guys were right.

25:24.231 --> 25:26.149
It's not over between them.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.818
And we're done.

25:28.903 --> 25:31.154
- Sorry, buddy.
- Yeah, sorry, Vin.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.198
We're all sorry, bro.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.741
Yeah.

25:34.825 --> 25:36.242
Are you mad at us for telling you?

25:36.952 --> 25:38.620
No, I love you guys for telling me.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.371
Anything we can do for you?

25:40.456 --> 25:41.623
Nah.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.709
Actually, tell Ari

25:44.793 --> 25:46.920
I'm not gonna do the movie.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.130
I couldn't work with her every day.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.467
I'm gonna go to bed.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.191
My life is over!

26:09.818 --> 26:12.070
You will bounce back, Ari Gold.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.405
I drove to work in an $80,000 Mercedes.

26:14.490 --> 26:17.450
I'm driving home in a prop car
from The Fast and the Furious.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.327
I just don't see it.

26:31.882 --> 26:34.300
What the hell am I gonna say to my wife?

26:37.179 --> 26:38.471
Ari...

26:39.473 --> 26:42.433
I've worked 18 hours a day
to save up the money

26:42.518 --> 26:45.353
to put myself through
Stanford Business School.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.064
While I was there, I cleaned the cafeteria

26:48.148 --> 26:50.024
during the hours I wasn't studying

26:50.109 --> 26:52.485
and still graduated top of my class,

26:52.569 --> 26:54.696
only to take a job delivering mail

26:54.780 --> 26:58.408
to unappreciative overpaid little cocksuckers,

26:58.492 --> 27:00.285
then to finally get the big promotion

27:00.369 --> 27:02.328
that would allow me to answer your phones

27:02.413 --> 27:04.580
and be both racially and sexually harassed

27:04.665 --> 27:06.666
for the next nine months.

27:07.418 --> 27:09.168
But I know the endgame,

27:09.253 --> 27:11.546
and you, Ari Gold, you are it.

27:12.006 --> 27:13.464
So stop your fucking whining,

27:13.549 --> 27:15.883
and go into your gorgeous $3 million house

27:15.968 --> 27:17.677
with your beautiful goddess wife

27:17.761 --> 27:19.554
and figure out how you're going to make

27:19.638 --> 27:22.056
both of our lives happen tomorrow!

27:24.268 --> 27:26.519
That was a good speech, Lloyd.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.647
If I was 25 and liked cock,
we could be something.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.066
Oy.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.152
We're gonna be okay, Lloyd.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.158
Oh, my God.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.162
This is fate.

28:11.565 --> 28:13.316
Are you out of your fucking mind, Ari?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.526
Get in the house, now!

28:15.611 --> 28:17.028
Baby. Baby!

28:17.112 --> 28:18.780
- You're drunk?
- Baby!

28:18.864 --> 28:20.531
What happened to your hand?

28:20.616 --> 28:22.408
Dance with me, baby. Nothing, nothing.

28:22.493 --> 28:26.204
I haven't stopped thinking about you.
Baby, you're my everything. Baby, baby!

28:26.288 --> 28:27.914
Lloyd, what the hell is wrong with him?

28:27.998 --> 28:30.333
- Baby!
- He is in love is all.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.335
Good night!

28:35.464 --> 28:37.423
Come on. Baby, this is our song.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.050
You are my life.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.511
I'm not going into that house
until you dance with me.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.471
The music's gone, Ari.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.892
That's weird, but I can still feel it.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.352
Come on.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.771
- Ari?
- What? Come on, baby.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.065
Feel it in the house, okay?

28:57.486 --> 28:59.862
- Ari! Ow!
- My fucking hand, baby!

29:01.115 --> 29:02.115
Oh! Ari...

29:02.199 --> 29:03.950
Ari, the neighbors.

29:04.305 --> 29:10.423
