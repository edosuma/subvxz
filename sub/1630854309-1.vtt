01:19.880 --> 01:21.240
<i>Dear Mr. Stevens:</i>

01:21.480 --> 01:24.560
<i>You will be surprised to hear
from me after all this time.</i>

01:24.800 --> 01:28.720
<i>You've been in my thoughts since
I heard Lord Darlington had died.</i>

01:28.960 --> 01:32.440
<i>We read that his heirs
put Darlington Hall up for sale...</i>

01:32.680 --> 01:34.960
<i>... as they no longer wished
to maintain it.</i>

01:35.200 --> 01:38.840
<i>As no one would buy
such a large house...</i>

01:39.080 --> 01:44.320
<i>... the new earl decided to demolish
it and sell the stone for 5000 pounds.</i>

01:44.560 --> 01:48.240
<i>We also saw some rubbish in the
Daily Mail "which made my blood boil:"</i>

01:48.480 --> 01:50.360
<i>"Traitor's nest to be pulled down."</i>

01:50.600 --> 01:52.560
One hundred and eighty guineas?

01:52.800 --> 01:56.440
One hundred and eighty?
Have we done?

01:56.600 --> 02:00.040
Ladies and gentlemen,
a great highlight of the sale:

02:00.280 --> 02:02.200
Lot 414...

02:02.440 --> 02:06.600
<i>...the fine Elizabethan portrait,
A Portly Gentleman.</i>

02:06.840 --> 02:09.400
I'll start the bidding
at 2000 guineas.

02:09.639 --> 02:11.160
2000 guineas, thank you.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.360
2200.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.840
2400.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.440
2600.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.000
2800.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.760
3000. 3200.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.160
3400. 3600.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.600
3800.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.440
4000 guineas.
Four and a half thousand.

02:25.680 --> 02:26.920
5000.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.360
And a half.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.920
6000.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.240
And a half.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.640
7 000.

02:33.880 --> 02:34.840
And a half.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.560
8000.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.640
And a half.

02:38.880 --> 02:39.960
9000.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.400
And a half.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.520
10,000 guineas is bid.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.400
And a half.

02:45.640 --> 02:46.800
11,000.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.240
And a half.

02:48.480 --> 02:53.920
Against you, sir,
at eleven and a half thousand guineas.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.040
All done at
eleven and a half thousand guineas.

02:58.280 --> 03:01.840
<i>I was very relieved to read
how an American millionaire...</i>

03:02.080 --> 03:03.960
<i>... named Lewis saved
Darlington Hall...</i>

03:04.200 --> 03:07.040
<i>... so you wouldn't be turned out
of your home after all.</i>

03:07.280 --> 03:09.360
<i>Is it the same Congressman Lewis...</i>

03:09.600 --> 03:14.880
<i>... who attended His Lordship's
conference in 1936?</i>

03:23.160 --> 03:25.840
<i>Mr. Stevens, I so often think
of the good old days...</i>

03:26.080 --> 03:28.560
<i>... when I was the housekeeper.</i>

03:28.800 --> 03:29.720
<i>It was hard work...</i>

03:29.960 --> 03:34.600
<i>... and I have known butlers easier
to please than our Mr. Stevens...</i>

03:34.840 --> 03:39.960
<i>... but those years with you were
among the happiest of my life.</i>

03:42.680 --> 03:45.240
<i>You must have a completely
different staff now.</i>

03:45.480 --> 03:47.640
<i>Not many of the old faces
around anymore.</i>

03:47.880 --> 03:51.440
<i>There's not much need
for the small army of footmen...</i>

03:51.680 --> 03:55.640
<i>... that Lord Darlington employed.</i>

04:09.080 --> 04:11.600
<i>My own news is not very cheerful.</i>

04:11.840 --> 04:15.640
<i>In the 7 years since I last wrote, 
I have again left my husband...</i>

04:15.880 --> 04:19.200
<i>... and, sad to say, 
my marriage seems to be over.</i>

04:19.440 --> 04:23.680
<i>I'm staying at a friend's
boarding house in Clevedon.</i>

04:50.640 --> 04:52.920
<i>I don't know what my future is.</i>

04:53.160 --> 04:57.720
<i>Since Catherine, my daughter, got
married, my life has been empty.</i>

04:57.960 --> 05:02.160
<i>The years stretch before me and
if only I knew how to fill them.</i>

05:02.400 --> 05:06.320
<i>But I would like to be useful again.</i>

05:12.200 --> 05:15.640
- Burned again?
- Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.440
The rule in the kitchen
has always been...

05:18.680 --> 05:23.360
...cook cooks the cooked breakfast
while her assistant toasts the toast.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.040
Why don't we get her a pop-up toaster?

05:26.280 --> 05:30.600
We need not a new gadget
but a revised staff plan, sir.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.640
A staff plan, huh?
I didn't know we had one.

05:33.880 --> 05:37.240
A faulty one, unfortunately.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.560
Sir, quite recently...

05:39.800 --> 05:44.040
...you were kind enough to suggest
that I go on a little holiday trip...

05:44.280 --> 05:46.240
...around the country.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.040
Absolutely. Certainly, take a break.
See the world.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.040
Thank you, sir.

05:51.280 --> 05:55.040
When did you last see the world?

05:55.880 --> 05:59.920
The world always used to come
to this house, if I may say so.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.600
You may say so.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.960
Take off when I'm in London next week.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.960
I tell you what, you take the car.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.840
- Take the Daimler.
- Good Lord, sir, I couldn't.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.440
You and that Daimler belong together.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.240
You were made for each other.

06:15.480 --> 06:19.240
That's most kind of you,
I must say, sir. Most kind.

06:19.480 --> 06:24.040
I'd meant to travel the West, where I
understand we have splendid scenery.

06:24.280 --> 06:28.600
And I might incidentally be able
to solve our problems while I'm there.

06:28.840 --> 06:33.560
A former housekeeper, at present
living in Clevedon, has indicated...

06:33.800 --> 06:36.360
...that she might be prepared
to return to service.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.400
What's this, your girlfriend?

06:38.640 --> 06:40.360
Or a former attachment?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.720
Oh, no, sir.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.760
No, but a very able housekeeper.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.560
A most able housekeeper.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.800
I was just kidding, Stevens.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.360
Sorry.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.160
You know what I like best
about your papers?

06:57.400 --> 06:59.000
These obituaries.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.960
Every son of a gun gets
this stately funeral oration.

07:02.200 --> 07:06.440
- It's not an art we have in the States.
- Indeed, sir.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.520
Thank you, Stevens.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.280
Mr. Lewis.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.920
<i>Dear Mrs. Benn...</i>

07:44.160 --> 07:48.320
<i>... I propose to reach Clevedon
on October 3rd around 4 p.m.</i>

07:48.560 --> 07:50.440
<i>I'd be grateful for a line from you...</i>

07:50.680 --> 07:54.840
<i>... to reach me at the post office
at Collingbourne, near Hungerford...</i>

07:55.080 --> 07:58.480
<i>... where I'm planning to stop.</i>

08:04.040 --> 08:08.040
<i>Mrs. Benn, I always said you
possess an amazing memory.</i>

08:08.280 --> 08:11.160
<i>Our new employer is indeed
Congressman Lewis...</i>

08:11.400 --> 08:14.800
<i>... though he's now retired
from political life in the U.S.</i>

08:15.040 --> 08:19.440
<i>He's taken up residence at Darlington
Hall, soon to be joined by his family.</i>

08:19.680 --> 08:24.440
<i>But I regret to say we are woefully
understaffed for a house this size.</i>

08:24.680 --> 08:28.640
<i>Mrs. Benn, will you permit me
once again to sing your praises?</i>

08:28.880 --> 08:31.400
<i>Let me state that when you left
to get married...</i>

08:31.640 --> 08:38.039
<i>... no housekeeper ever reached
your high standard in any department.</i>

08:46.600 --> 08:49.360
<i>I well remember your arrival
at Darlington Hall.</i>

08:49.600 --> 08:53.440
<i>You came somewhat unexpectedly, 
one might even say impulsively...</i>

08:53.680 --> 08:56.760
<i>... while we were dead in the middle
of the Charlgrove meet.</i>

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
<i>That day is marked in my
memory in another way as well.</i>

09:00.240 --> 09:02.040
<i>It was the last time His Lordship...</i>

09:02.280 --> 09:05.400
<i>... was happy to welcome
his neighbours, as in the old days.</i>

09:05.640 --> 09:09.360
<i>Of course, it had been years since
any of them had coaxed him to hunt.</i>

09:09.600 --> 09:14.560
<i>It was never a sport His Lordship
enjoyed or approved of.</i>

09:34.280 --> 09:38.320
- Good morning, Ayres.
- My lord, nice to see you.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.760
Excuse me, sir.

10:05.280 --> 10:09.800
<i>I fear I may have been a little
unwelcoming, even a little short.</i>

10:10.040 --> 10:12.840
<i>You presented the best references
I've ever seen.</i>

10:13.080 --> 10:15.240
<i>Which proved to be well-deserved.</i>

10:15.480 --> 10:19.360
<i>Though, I confess, I did have my
doubts, on account of your youth.</i>

10:19.600 --> 10:22.040
No gentleman callers allowed,
of course.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.640
Forgive my mentioning it, but we've
had those problems before.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.520
Inside the house too.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.640
The previous housekeeper ran off
with the under-butler.

10:31.880 --> 10:36.480
If two staff members decide to get
married, one can say nothing.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.760
What I find a major irritation...

10:39.000 --> 10:44.720
...are those persons who go from
post to post looking for romance.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.600
Housekeepers are particularly
guilty here.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.640
- No offense intended, of course.
- None taken.

10:50.880 --> 10:55.840
I know how a house is at sixes and
sevens once the staff start marrying.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.760
Yes, indeed.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.800
- Might I have a word, sir?
- Of course.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.400
My lord, it's regarding
the under-butler...

11:12.640 --> 11:16.240
...and the housekeeper
who ran off last month.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.200
Bad business.
How are you managing?

11:18.440 --> 11:20.760
I've found two
first-rate replacements.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.720
Miss Kenton, a young woman
with excellent references.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.640
Very pleasing demeanour.
Appears to be very able.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.400
And a man with
considerable experience.

11:29.640 --> 11:34.000
- Older and happy to be under-butler.
- Name?

11:34.240 --> 11:35.040
Stevens, sir.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.040
- Stevens?
- Yes, sir.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.160
- That's your name.
- He's my father, sir.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.040
Really?

11:42.280 --> 11:44.760
Couldn't do better.
I'd like to see him sometime.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.240
He's outside the door.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.080
Good. Bring him in.

11:48.320 --> 11:51.160
Thank you, my lord.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.960
Father.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.160
Mr. Stevens, how do you do?

12:02.400 --> 12:04.880
- My lord.
- Very good man here, your son.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.920
He serves the house well.
I don't know what we'd do without him.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.440
- Proud of him?
- Very, my lord.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.480
Quite right too.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.040
Glad to have you with us.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.880
Thank you, my lord.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.640
What are we at dinner tonight?
14? 16?

12:23.880 --> 12:24.920
Twelve, sir.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.440
Right.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.960
Thank you, my lord.

12:55.880 --> 13:01.680
- This pitcher seems out of place here.
- Dining room. Well spotted.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.680
- Hello, William, how are you?
- Good day, Miss Kenton.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.040
I thought these might
brighten your parlour.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.120
Beg your pardon?

13:59.360 --> 14:01.720
They might cheer things up for you.

14:01.960 --> 14:05.120
That's very kind of you.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.000
If you like, I could bring in
some more for you.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.040
Thank you...

14:11.280 --> 14:14.560
...but I regard this room
as my private place of work...

14:14.800 --> 14:17.640
...and I prefer to keep distractions
to a minimum.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.560
Would you call flowers
a distraction, then?

14:20.800 --> 14:24.120
I appreciate your kindness.
I prefer to keep things as they are.

14:24.360 --> 14:28.720
But since you are here, there is a
small matter I wanted to mention.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.400
I happened to be walking past
the kitchen yesterday morning...

14:32.640 --> 14:35.160
...and I heard you call
to someone named William.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.640
May I ask who you were
addressing by that name?

14:39.880 --> 14:43.200
I should think I was
addressing your father.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.640
There are no other Williams
in this house.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.640
True.

14:47.880 --> 14:51.560
May I ask you in future to address
my father as Mr. Stevens?

14:51.800 --> 14:54.840
If speaking of him
to a third party, you may call him...

14:55.080 --> 14:57.520
...Mr. Stevens Sr.
to distinguish him from myself.

14:57.760 --> 15:02.400
So I would be most grateful to you,
Miss Kenton.

15:02.640 --> 15:06.240
I don't quite understand
what you're getting at.

15:06.480 --> 15:11.040
I am the housekeeper in this house,
and your father is the under-butler.

15:11.280 --> 15:17.000
I am accustomed to addressing under-
servants by their Christian names.

15:17.040 --> 15:20.840
If you would stop to think for a moment,
you'd realize...

15:21.080 --> 15:24.920
...how inappropriate it is for one such
as yourself to address as William...

15:25.160 --> 15:27.840
...someone such as my father.

15:28.080 --> 15:32.600
It must have been very galling for
your father to be called William...

15:32.840 --> 15:34.760
...by one such as myself.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.240
My father is a person from whom...

15:37.480 --> 15:40.480
...if you'd observe him more,
you may learn things.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.320
I'm grateful for your advice,
but do tell me...

15:43.560 --> 15:45.640
...what things might I learn from him?

15:45.880 --> 15:47.840
I might point out that you're...

15:48.080 --> 15:52.160
...often unsure of what goes where
and which item is which.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.160
I'm sure Mr. Stevens Sr.
is very good at his job...

15:56.400 --> 15:59.560
...but I can assure you
that I'm very good at mine.

15:59.800 --> 16:00.880
- Of course.
- Thank you.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.480
If you will please excuse me.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.880
Oh, well.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.520
My compliments to cook.

16:18.760 --> 16:22.160
What a lovely piece of crackling.

16:22.240 --> 16:27.360
I'm sure you said something witty.
Share it with the rest of us.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.760
I said the sprouts is done the way
I like them. Crisp-like, not mushy.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.440
Sprouts "are" done, not "is" done.

16:34.680 --> 16:35.720
Isn't that right, George?

16:35.960 --> 16:36.920
Yes, Mr. Stevens.

16:37.160 --> 16:40.760
Forgive the correction,
as I would have done...

16:41.000 --> 16:43.560
...at your age for the sake
of my education.

16:43.800 --> 16:48.040
I'm sure even you have ambitions
to rise in your profession.

16:48.280 --> 16:52.040
Oh, yes. I want to be
a butler, to be called Mister...

16:52.280 --> 16:56.080
...sit in my own pantry by my own fire,
smoking my cigar.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.600
I wonder if you realize what it takes
to be a great butler?

16:59.840 --> 17:02.320
Takes dignity, that's what it takes.

17:02.560 --> 17:07.240
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
Dignity, that's right. Dignity.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.920
The definition from our quarterly
"The Gentlemen's Gentleman":

17:11.160 --> 17:13.520
A great butler must be possessed
of dignity...

17:13.760 --> 17:17.280
In keeping with his position.

17:17.839 --> 17:21.440
There was this English butler
in India.

17:21.680 --> 17:26.119
One day, he goes in the dining room
and what's under the table?

17:26.359 --> 17:28.160
A tiger.

17:28.400 --> 17:33.320
Not turning a hair,
he goes to the drawing room.

17:33.600 --> 17:38.440
"Excuse me, my lord," and whispering,
so as not to upset the ladies:

17:38.680 --> 17:42.240
"I'm sorry. There appears to
be a tiger in the dining room.

17:42.480 --> 17:47.920
Perhaps His Lordship will permit
use of the twelve-bores?"

17:48.000 --> 17:52.800
They go on drinking their tea.
And then, there's three gunshots.

17:53.040 --> 17:57.640
They don't think nothing of it.
In India, they're used to anything.

17:57.880 --> 18:01.360
When the butler is back
to refresh the teapots...

18:01.600 --> 18:03.640
...he says, cool as a cucumber:

18:03.880 --> 18:07.200
"Dinner will be served
at the usual time, my lord.

18:07.440 --> 18:11.520
And I am pleased to say there will
be no discernible traces left...

18:11.760 --> 18:16.480
...of the recent occurrence
by that time."

18:17.080 --> 18:20.560
I'll repeat it. "There will be
no discernible traces left...

18:20.800 --> 18:25.640
...of the recent occurrence
by that time."

18:25.880 --> 18:28.320
- Wonderful, Mr. Stevens.
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

18:28.560 --> 18:34.640
Wonderful story. That's the ideal
that we should all aim for. Dignity.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.640
For you, Mr. Stevens.

18:37.880 --> 18:38.720
Thank you.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.760
It's for Mr. Stevens Sr.,
Mr. Stevens.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.360
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.960
Put Mr. Stevens Sr. 's plate
with cook to keep it warm.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.840
Yes, Miss Kenton.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.000
Thank you.

18:53.240 --> 18:56.480
Not at all, Mr. Stevens.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.440
If you're searching for your dustpan,
it is out on the landing.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.640
My dustpan?

20:28.880 --> 20:31.200
You've left it on the landing.

20:31.440 --> 20:35.320
- I haven't used a dustpan.
- Really? It must be somebody else.

20:35.560 --> 20:40.200
- I don't follow you.
- My mistake, no doubt. One of many.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.800
Morning, sir.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.640
I've invited Giscard Dupont D'Ivry
as the French delegate.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.360
He'll never come!

21:02.600 --> 21:05.120
I just had word of his acceptance.

21:05.360 --> 21:10.160
Dupont is fanatically anti-German.
His speech in Geneva in '33...

21:10.400 --> 21:13.040
...made me ashamed to be
an ally of the French.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.840
It's not the English way.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.080
No, it is not.

21:16.320 --> 21:20.600
This is the purpose of our conference,
to discuss these matters informally...

21:20.840 --> 21:23.720
...far from the to-do
of an international conference...

21:23.960 --> 21:26.720
...in the friendly and relaxed...

21:26.960 --> 21:30.160
...atmosphere of one's home.

21:30.400 --> 21:33.120
We may bring round the French
to our point of view.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.240
And that of the Germans.

21:35.480 --> 21:39.720
I'm sorry to interrupt, but how can we
associate with the Germans?

21:39.960 --> 21:43.840
With the Nazi Party! They have torn
up and trampled every treaty...

21:44.080 --> 21:48.440
...and are a growing threat to Europe,
not to mention a brutal dictatorship.

21:48.680 --> 21:53.840
My dear boy, when I was in Berlin,
I saw at last a happy German people...

21:54.080 --> 21:58.200
...with jobs, bread, pride in their
country and love of their leader.

21:58.440 --> 22:01.760
And what about the Jews?

22:06.400 --> 22:10.240
Did His Lordship wish to exchange
the Chinaman in the cabinet room...

22:10.480 --> 22:12.400
...with the one outside the door?

22:12.640 --> 22:14.040
- Chinaman?
- Yes.

22:14.280 --> 22:18.840
The Chinaman from the cabinet room is
outside this door. See for yourself.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.200
I'm busy at the moment.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.720
Just pop your head outside this door
and see for yourself.

22:24.960 --> 22:28.920
- I'll look into the matter later.
- You think it's a fantasy?

22:29.160 --> 22:31.800
A fantasy on my part
due to my inexperience?

22:32.040 --> 22:35.360
I'm busy in this room, Miss Kenton.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.600
I shall wait.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.440
Outside.

23:39.240 --> 23:40.040
Look!

23:40.280 --> 23:43.040
- Is that not the wrong Chinaman?
- I am very busy.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.520
Have you nothing better to do
than stand around?

23:45.760 --> 23:47.800
Look at it and tell me the truth.

23:48.040 --> 23:51.040
Keep your voice down.
What would the other servants think...

23:51.280 --> 23:53.440
...of us shouting about a Chinaman?

23:53.680 --> 23:55.400
And I would ask you...

23:55.640 --> 24:00.680
...to turn around
and look at the Chinaman.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.320
It is a small mistake.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.760
Your father is entrusted with more
than he can cope with.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.240
Let me pass.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.240
Your father left the dustpan
on the floor.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.240
He left polish on the cutlery
and confused the Chinaman.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.840
Recognize this before he commits
a major error!

24:20.080 --> 24:23.720
- You can't talk to me like this.
- I'm afraid I must.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.320
I'm giving you serious advice.

24:26.560 --> 24:31.400
Your father should be relieved of a
number of his duties for his own good.

24:31.640 --> 24:36.440
Whatever he once was, he no longer
has the same ability or strength.

24:36.680 --> 24:39.040
I thank you for your advice.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.200
Perhaps now I can go about
my business.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.320
I never meant to keep you
from your business.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.200
Thank you.

24:49.440 --> 24:54.640
It's vital that we've agreed a common
policy before the arrival of...

24:54.880 --> 24:58.440
...your Frenchman. What's his name?
- Giscard Dupont D'Ivry.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.920
We also expect the
American delegate...

25:01.160 --> 25:04.200
...Congressman Lewis,
to arrive on the same day.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.400
Who is he, this American?

25:06.640 --> 25:11.120
He's an unknown quantity. A young
congressman from Pennsylvania.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.760
Sits on some sort of powerful
Foreign Affairs Committee.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.240
Heir to one of those
American fortunes.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.440
- Meatpacking?
- Trolley cars?

25:19.680 --> 25:21.360
Or dry goods?

25:21.600 --> 25:23.440
What are dry goods?

25:23.680 --> 25:26.200
Something that Americans make
a lot of money in.

25:26.440 --> 25:32.200
No, I think Mr. Lewis' fortune
comes from cosmetics, actually.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.880
It's old Mr. Stevens!

25:38.880 --> 25:42.520
Get a cushion, quickly.
A blanket!

25:44.480 --> 25:47.640
The silver!
The silver!

25:47.880 --> 25:50.280
Oh, my lord. Sorry.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.440
You'll be all right.

25:52.680 --> 25:55.520
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry.
What happened?

25:55.760 --> 25:58.520
- He tripped with the tray.
- I saw it from the window.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.720
This has never happened before.

26:00.960 --> 26:05.160
- May I telephone the doctor?
- Yes, do.

26:05.360 --> 26:08.640
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.840
Your father feeling better?

26:22.080 --> 26:23.760
He's made a full recovery.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.400
Good.

26:25.640 --> 26:29.520
We don't wish to see anything
of that sort ever happen again, do we?

26:29.760 --> 26:32.840
- I mean, your father collapsing.
- Indeed not, my lord.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.640
And it could happen anywhere.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.200
At any time.

26:38.440 --> 26:42.320
The first of the foreign delegates
will be here in less than a fortnight.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.520
- We are well prepared, my lord.
- I'm sure you are.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.520
What happens within this house
could have...

26:48.760 --> 26:52.400
...considerable repercussions
on the course that Europe takes.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.160
It means a great deal.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.640
And it means a great deal
to me personally.

26:57.880 --> 27:02.040
I had a German friend,
Karl-Heinz Bremann.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.920
We fought on opposite sides
in the war.

27:05.160 --> 27:08.840
We always said when it was over,
we'd sit down and have a drink...

27:09.080 --> 27:11.840
...like gentlemen.

27:12.160 --> 27:15.200
The Versailles Treaty
made a liar of me.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.960
Yes, a liar, Stevens.

27:18.200 --> 27:23.000
Because the terms we imposed were
so harsh that Germany was finished.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.040
One doesn't do that
to a defeated foe.

27:25.280 --> 27:29.040
Once your man's on the canvas,
it ought to be over.

27:29.280 --> 27:33.240
My friend Bremann
was ruined by inflation.

27:33.480 --> 27:37.000
Couldn't get a job
in postwar Germany.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.520
Killed himself.

27:39.760 --> 27:44.000
Shot himself in a railway carriage.

27:44.240 --> 27:48.440
Since then, I've felt it my duty
to help Germany and to give her...

27:48.680 --> 27:50.000
...a fair chance.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.200
So this conference is crucial...

27:52.440 --> 27:55.840
...and we can't run the risk
of any accidents.

27:56.080 --> 27:58.800
There's no question
of your father leaving.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.240
You're simply being asked
to reconsider his duties.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.240
Of course, my lord.
I understand fully.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.040
Good.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.120
I'll leave you to think about it,
then, Stevens.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.840
Thank you, sir.

29:12.960 --> 29:17.320
I'm short-handed in the dining room.
I can use you in the servery.

29:17.560 --> 29:22.400
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens, sir.
- Smarten up. Look sharp.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.000
Good morning.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.760
Good morning.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.400
I might've known you'd be up
and ready for the day.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.160
I've been up for two hours.

29:41.400 --> 29:46.480
- That's not much sleep.
- It's all the sleep I need.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.400
I've come to talk to you.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.640
Talk, then.
I haven't got all morning.

29:52.880 --> 29:56.160
- I'll come straight to the point.
- Do, and be done with it.

29:56.400 --> 30:00.280
Some of us have work
to be getting on with.

30:01.040 --> 30:05.600
There's to be a very important
conference in this house next week.

30:05.840 --> 30:09.440
People of great stature will be
His Lordship's guests.

30:09.680 --> 30:13.480
We must all put our best foot forward.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.240
Because of Father's recent accident...

30:16.480 --> 30:21.600
...it has been suggested that you
no longer wait at table.

30:24.360 --> 30:27.560
I've waited at table every day...

30:27.800 --> 30:31.840
...for the last 54 years.

30:32.440 --> 30:36.760
It has also been decided that you
should no longer carry heavy trays.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.960
Now, here's a revised list
of your duties.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.960
Look, I fell...

30:42.200 --> 30:43.920
...because of those paving stones.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.240
They're crooked.

30:46.480 --> 30:51.280
Why don't you get them put right
before someone else falls?

30:51.840 --> 30:55.440
You will read the revised list
of your duties.

30:55.680 --> 30:59.480
Get those stones put right.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.160
You don't want those "gentlemen of stature"
breaking their necks.

31:06.080 --> 31:09.400
No, indeed, I don't.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.320
What is it?

31:51.400 --> 31:54.280
You have what we can call
a roving commission.

31:54.520 --> 31:57.960
In other words, you can exercise
your own judgment...

31:58.200 --> 32:00.280
...within certain limits, of course.

32:00.520 --> 32:04.000
Now, here are the mops, and...
Here.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.840
- Are these me mops?
- Right. Your brushes.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.600
And me brushes?

32:09.840 --> 32:13.600
- And me mops.
- That's right.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.080
What do you want me to do with them?

32:17.320 --> 32:22.080
I think you know what to do with them,
Father. Look for dust and dirt.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.880
If I find any dust or dirt...

32:25.120 --> 32:27.440
...I go over them with this mop.

32:27.680 --> 32:28.880
That's right.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.840
Now, I suggest you start off...

32:32.080 --> 32:34.240
...with the brasses on the doors.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.160
There's that door there.
Then the door that's open.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.920
And then there's this door here...

32:47.520 --> 32:50.520
Here's your polish.
And duster.

32:50.760 --> 32:55.480
History could well be made under
this roof over the next few days.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.560
Each and every one of you...

32:57.800 --> 33:02.840
...can be proud of the role
you will play on this occasion.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.880
<i>Imagine yourself
the head of a battalion...</i>

33:06.120 --> 33:09.840
<i>... even if it is only filling
the hot-water bottles.</i>

33:10.080 --> 33:12.680
<i>Each one has his own
particular duty...</i>

33:12.920 --> 33:15.760
<i>... or her particular duty, 
as the cap fits.</i>

33:16.000 --> 33:20.680
<i>Polished brass, brilliant silver, 
mahogany shining like a mirror.</i>

33:20.920 --> 33:23.960
<i>That is the welcome we will show
these foreign visitors...</i>

33:24.200 --> 33:26.280
<i>... to let them know
they are in England...</i>

33:26.520 --> 33:31.600
<i>... where order and tradition
still prevail.</i>

33:58.640 --> 34:01.320
Thank you, Brian.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.239
Mr. Lewis, the American,
has arrived.

34:31.480 --> 34:34.679
He was expected tomorrow.
What have you done with him?

34:34.920 --> 34:38.760
Mr. Lewis has been shown upstairs.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.800
My godson, Cardinal, will shortly
become engaged to be married.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.639
Indeed, sir.
I offer my congratulations.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.760
Thank you, Stevens.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.880
I feel very responsible for the boy.

34:52.120 --> 34:56.360
He is my godson, and his father
was my closest friend, as you know.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.040
And now that he's gone, well...

34:59.280 --> 35:02.040
...I feel in place of a father to him.

35:02.280 --> 35:05.000
I've appointed him as my secretary
at the conference.

35:05.240 --> 35:10.000
He's been jolly thorough
in helping me to prepare.

35:16.280 --> 35:21.000
I realize this is a somewhat
irregular thing to ask you to do.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.480
I'd be glad to be of any assistance.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.400
I'm sorry to bring this up...

35:25.640 --> 35:29.880
...but I just can't see how on earth
to make it go away.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.680
You are familiar with
the facts of life?

35:32.920 --> 35:35.160
- My lord?
- The facts of life.

35:35.400 --> 35:39.520
Birds, bees.
You are familiar, aren't you?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.760
I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.400
Let me put my cards on the table.

35:44.640 --> 35:48.440
I'm so busy with this conference.
Of course, you are too...

35:48.680 --> 35:51.120
...but someone has to tell him.

35:51.360 --> 35:54.440
In a way, it would be easier for you.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.160
Less awkward.

35:56.400 --> 35:59.080
I'd find the task rather daunting,
I'm afraid.

35:59.320 --> 36:02.760
I might not get to it
before Reginald's wedding day.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.920
Of course, this goes far beyond
the call of duty.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.280
I shall do my best.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.880
I'd be grateful if you'd try.
It'd be a lot off my mind.

36:16.120 --> 36:21.800
There's no need to make a song and
dance of it. Just convey the facts.

36:38.320 --> 36:41.160
God! Stevens!

36:41.400 --> 36:42.760
Sorry. Most sorry, sir...

36:43.000 --> 36:46.240
...but I do have something to convey
to you rather urgently.

36:46.480 --> 36:49.080
If I may, I'll come to the point.

36:49.320 --> 36:54.040
Perhaps you noticed this morning the
ducks and the geese by the pond?

36:54.280 --> 36:57.160
Ducks and geese?
I don't think so.

36:57.400 --> 37:01.640
Well, perhaps the birds
and the flowers, then...

37:01.880 --> 37:04.080
...or the shrubs, the bees...

37:04.320 --> 37:06.480
I've not seen any bees.

37:06.720 --> 37:11.240
- It's not the best time to see them.
- What, the bees?

37:11.480 --> 37:15.160
What I'm saying is that,
with the arrival of spring...

37:15.400 --> 37:19.240
...we shall see a most remarkable
and profound change...

37:19.480 --> 37:20.760
...in the surroundings.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.080
I'm sure that's right. I'm sure the
grounds are not at their best now.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.280
I wasn't paying attention
to the glories of nature...

37:28.520 --> 37:30.640
...because it's worrying...

37:30.880 --> 37:34.760
Dupont D'Ivry has arrived in a foul
mood, the last thing anyone wants.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.080
- M. Dupont D'Ivry has arrived?
- Half an hour ago, in a foul mood.

37:39.320 --> 37:43.640
In that case, excuse me.
I'd better go and attend to him.

37:43.880 --> 37:46.320
Right you are.
Kind of you to talk to me.

37:46.560 --> 37:50.760
Not at all. I've one or two words
more to convey on the topic of...

37:51.000 --> 37:53.200
...as you put it most admirably...

37:53.440 --> 37:54.680
...the glories of nature.

37:54.920 --> 37:57.280
But it must wait for another occasion.

37:57.520 --> 38:00.440
I'll look forward to it.
But I'm more of a fish man.

38:00.680 --> 38:02.400
- Fish?
- I know all about fish.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.840
Freshwater and salt.

38:05.080 --> 38:08.440
All living creatures would be
relevant to our discussion.

38:08.680 --> 38:12.640
Excuse me. I had no idea that
"Monsieur" Dupont D'Ivry had arrived.

38:12.880 --> 38:15.400
Thank you.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.000
May I be of assistance, sir?

38:27.240 --> 38:28.960
Oh, the butler.

38:29.200 --> 38:33.960
I have sore feet, so I need a basin
with warm water and salts, please.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.760
I'll arrange that with
the housekeeper, sir.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.520
Warm water and salts
as soon as possible.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.000
How do you do? But I speak English.

38:46.240 --> 38:50.480
Good. That's lucky for me.
I'm Jack Lewis, the U.S. delegate.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.840
Could we speak privately soon?

38:53.080 --> 38:54.000
Yes, of course.

38:54.240 --> 38:59.000
But I have blisters due to some
sightseeing they made me do in London.

38:59.240 --> 39:02.880
I had already seen
the Tower of London.

39:02.920 --> 39:06.080
I've discovered that things
are not moving...

39:06.320 --> 39:10.960
...in a direction that I think
you would approve of.

40:02.080 --> 40:05.280
German rearmament
is a fact to be accepted.

40:05.520 --> 40:08.760
It's in our own interest to have a free
and equal Germany.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.600
Not a prostrate nation...

40:10.840 --> 40:14.400
...upon whom an unfair peace treaty
was imposed 16 years ago.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.400
Those who've been in Germany...

40:16.640 --> 40:21.560
...can only thrill, as I have,
to the signs of rebirth.

40:21.800 --> 40:25.880
...to assist Germany in her virile
struggle for economic recovery...

40:26.120 --> 40:30.480
...including support for her fair
demand for equality of armaments...

40:30.720 --> 40:34.200
...and universal military service
for German youth.

40:34.440 --> 40:37.640
If we, in postwar Europe...

40:37.880 --> 40:42.480
I need more water.
I need another basin to bathe my feet.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.080
Follow me, sir.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.560
Excuse me.

40:53.800 --> 40:57.080
- We have to talk.
- This way, sir.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.880
My friend, I am in agony.
Too tight shoes. I blame myself.

41:12.120 --> 41:15.000
Vanity.

41:15.080 --> 41:18.960
We must do some fast maneuvering
to restrain the Germans.

41:19.200 --> 41:22.600
Please come this way, gentlemen.

41:29.720 --> 41:33.480
Butler, please, could you help me
with my feet... shoe?

41:33.720 --> 41:35.680
- Yes, of course.
- Take it off.

41:35.920 --> 41:41.760
What they said about equality of arms
for Germany, military service...

41:42.000 --> 41:43.760
- Sorry, sir.
- I'll manage.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.280
What?

41:50.120 --> 41:52.600
Your father's been taken ill, sir.

41:52.840 --> 41:56.080
- Where?
- Outside the Chinese bedroom, sir.

41:56.320 --> 42:00.760
Germany wants peace as much as we do.
She needs peace.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.440
Here, let me help you with that.

42:06.520 --> 42:09.120
Thank you.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.200
Thank you, Charles.

42:23.320 --> 42:25.480
Take a basin of hot water and salts...

42:25.720 --> 42:29.080
...to Mr. D'Ivry in the
billiards room. Is that understood?

42:29.320 --> 42:32.920
- Yes, Mr. Stevens.
- Good. Do it.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.920
Father?

43:34.680 --> 43:38.480
I have more time than you to look
after him. I've called the doctor.

43:38.720 --> 43:41.520
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

43:50.920 --> 43:54.520
Your father's not so good, I'm afraid.

43:55.520 --> 43:58.480
If he deteriorates, call me, will you?

43:58.720 --> 44:00.240
How old is he? 70, 72?

44:00.480 --> 44:02.600
- 75, sir.
- I see.

44:02.840 --> 44:08.160
- Lf he deteriorates, let me know.
- I will, sir. Thank you, doctor.

44:36.400 --> 44:40.120
More haste, less speed.

44:58.320 --> 45:01.240
There's something missing.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.280
What is it?

45:02.520 --> 45:06.160
- The spoon from the cruet set, sir.
- Good.

45:06.400 --> 45:07.960
Well observed.

45:08.200 --> 45:12.840
Now, never touch the lip of the glass.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.880
Good.

45:19.640 --> 45:22.680
Glass first, and then...

45:27.040 --> 45:30.840
Is everything in hand downstairs?

45:30.920 --> 45:34.480
We're preparing the last dinner
of the conference.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.640
You can imagine the kitchen.

45:36.880 --> 45:41.120
- But is everything in hand?
- Yes, I think we're up to scratch.

45:41.360 --> 45:45.240
Are you feeling any better?

45:46.720 --> 45:50.440
There's something I have to tell you.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.360
I have so much to do.
Why don't we talk in the morning?

45:54.600 --> 45:57.040
Jim...

45:57.320 --> 46:01.080
...I fell out of love
with your mother.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.960
I loved her once.

46:04.200 --> 46:10.200
The love went out of me
when I found her carrying on.

46:11.880 --> 46:14.600
A good son.

46:14.840 --> 46:17.880
Proud of you.

46:19.200 --> 46:22.920
I hope I've been a good father.

46:23.280 --> 46:26.760
I tried me best.

46:35.440 --> 46:38.200
You better get down there...

46:38.440 --> 46:44.160
...or heaven only knows
what they'll be up to.

46:54.400 --> 46:57.120
Go on.

46:57.320 --> 46:59.880
Go on!

47:00.720 --> 47:04.200
We'll talk in the morning.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.960
On the last day of our conference...

47:20.200 --> 47:23.880
...permit me to say
how impressed I have been...

47:24.120 --> 47:29.280
...with the spirit of goodwill
that has prevailed.

47:29.520 --> 47:31.760
Goodwill for Germany.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
And with tears in my eyes...

47:34.240 --> 47:37.080
...I see that everyone here
has recognized...

47:37.320 --> 47:42.560
...our right to be, once again,
a strong nation.

47:42.800 --> 47:45.440
With my hand on my heart,
I declare...

47:45.680 --> 47:47.680
...that Germany needs peace...

47:47.920 --> 47:52.040
...and desires only peace.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.760
Peace with England...

47:55.000 --> 47:58.640
...and peace with France.

48:02.920 --> 48:05.920
Thank you very much.

48:08.720 --> 48:12.080
I, too, have been impressed...

48:12.320 --> 48:14.640
...yes, deeply impressed...

48:14.880 --> 48:20.240
...by the genuine desire for peace
manifested at this conference.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.560
Unlike our American colleague...

48:22.800 --> 48:26.080
...we in Europe know
the horrors of war.

48:26.320 --> 48:31.200
And whether we are French
or English or Italian or German...

48:31.440 --> 48:36.000
...our one desire is to never
have to experience them again.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.080
Indeed.

48:37.320 --> 48:40.080
Impressed, or I may say touched...

48:40.320 --> 48:44.080
...by the words of goodwill
and friendship I have heard...

48:44.320 --> 48:47.520
...I promise you that I shall do
my utmost...

48:47.760 --> 48:49.960
...to change my country's policy...

48:50.200 --> 48:52.640
...towards that nation
which was once our foe...

48:52.880 --> 48:55.280
...but is now,
I may venture to say...

48:55.520 --> 48:57.920
...our friend.

49:14.640 --> 49:16.280
Ladies and gentlemen...

49:16.520 --> 49:20.680
...the United States doesn't want war
any more than you do.

49:20.920 --> 49:24.080
On the other hand, neither do we
want peace at any price...

49:24.320 --> 49:26.880
...because some prices,
you may find...

49:27.120 --> 49:29.680
...are too outrageously high to pay.

49:29.920 --> 49:33.360
But let's not get into that now.
We may have to soon enough.

49:33.600 --> 49:37.240
For the moment, let us raise
our glasses to Lord Darlington...

49:37.480 --> 49:41.760
...in gratitude for his
magnificent hospitality.

49:53.720 --> 49:58.560
Lord Darlington is a classic
English gentleman of the old school.

49:58.800 --> 50:02.360
Decent and honorable and well-meaning.

50:02.600 --> 50:06.440
So are all of you. All decent,
honorable and well-meaning gentlemen.

50:06.680 --> 50:10.480
It's a pleasure and a privilege
to visit with you here.

50:10.720 --> 50:12.000
But...

50:12.240 --> 50:14.240
...now, excuse me, I must say this...

50:14.480 --> 50:18.000
...you are, all of you, amateurs.

50:18.240 --> 50:22.520
And international affairs should
never be run by gentlemen amateurs.

50:22.760 --> 50:27.440
Do you have any idea of what sort
of a place the world is becoming?

50:27.680 --> 50:31.160
The days when you could act
out of noble instincts are over.

50:31.400 --> 50:35.680
Europe has become the arena of
"Realpolitik", the politics of reality.

50:35.920 --> 50:39.400
If you like, real politics.

50:39.640 --> 50:43.760
What you need is not gentlemen
politicians, but real ones.

50:44.000 --> 50:48.080
You need professionals,
or you're headed for disaster.

50:48.320 --> 50:50.800
So I propose a toast, gentlemen...

50:51.040 --> 50:54.080
...to the professionals.

51:01.320 --> 51:04.600
Well, I've no wish to enter
into a quarrel...

51:04.840 --> 51:06.640
...on our last evening together.

51:06.880 --> 51:11.040
But let me say this.
What you describe as amateurism...

51:11.280 --> 51:15.560
...is what I think most of us here
still prefer to call honour.

51:15.800 --> 51:20.360
Miss Kenton would like to see you
concerning your father.

51:20.600 --> 51:24.840
I suggest that your professionalism
means greed and power...

51:25.080 --> 51:29.000
...rather than to see justice
and goodness prevail in the world.

51:29.240 --> 51:33.280
I've never concealed from myself
that what we were asking of Germany...

51:33.520 --> 51:39.360
...is a complete break from the
tradition of this country. Thank you.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.080
Mr. Stevens, I'm very sorry.

51:52.320 --> 51:55.600
Your father passed away
four minutes ago.

51:55.840 --> 51:57.960
Oh, I see.

51:58.200 --> 52:01.080
I'm so very sorry.

52:01.320 --> 52:04.880
I wish there was something
I could say.

52:05.120 --> 52:06.960
Will you come up and see him?

52:07.200 --> 52:11.760
Well, I'm very busy at the moment.
In a little while, perhaps.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.480
In that case, will you permit me
to close his eyes?

52:15.720 --> 52:19.960
I would be most grateful.
Thank you.

52:26.200 --> 52:30.640
My father would wish me to carry on.
I can't let him down.

52:30.880 --> 52:34.200
No. Of course.

53:45.520 --> 53:48.680
I'd really like to continue
our little chat sometime.

53:48.920 --> 53:50.480
About nature.

53:50.720 --> 53:54.360
You're right. I should come back
when everything's burgeoning.

53:54.600 --> 53:56.040
Yes, sir. Indeed.

53:56.280 --> 54:00.080
As I said before, my main interest
has always been in fish.

54:00.320 --> 54:04.080
When I was small,
I kept tropical fish in a tank.

54:04.320 --> 54:07.080
I harboured quite a passion for them.

54:07.320 --> 54:10.480
I'll have another drop of that,
if you don't mind.

54:10.720 --> 54:12.560
You all right?

54:12.800 --> 54:14.160
I'm perfectly all right.

54:14.400 --> 54:15.960
Not feeling unwell?

54:16.200 --> 54:20.040
No, sir. A little tired, perhaps.

54:38.600 --> 54:39.840
Wonderful!

54:40.080 --> 54:44.840
What a beautiful example of German
culture you've brought to this house.

54:45.080 --> 54:47.680
Very nice.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.760
I hope there's no hard feelings.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.640
Oh, my dear good chap.

54:51.880 --> 54:55.880
I like a good, clean fight.
Giving as good as one gets, what?

54:56.120 --> 54:59.480
I have the greatest respect
for the English. I love it here.

54:59.720 --> 55:03.040
My family brought us here as kids,
so I feel at home.

55:03.280 --> 55:04.760
Anyway, thank you.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.480
Excuse me.

55:07.600 --> 55:09.680
You all right?

55:09.920 --> 55:12.880
Yes, perfect, my lord.

55:13.520 --> 55:17.160
You coming down
with a cold or something?

55:17.400 --> 55:18.600
It's been a long day.

55:18.840 --> 55:21.760
It's been a hard day for both of us.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.920
Well done.

55:49.240 --> 55:51.000
My condolences.

55:51.240 --> 55:56.120
It was a stroke. A severe stroke.
He wouldn't have suffered much pain.

55:56.360 --> 55:59.560
Thank you for telling me.

56:20.440 --> 56:25.040
There's a distinguished foreign
gentleman in the billiard room...

56:25.280 --> 56:26.440
...in need of attention.

56:26.680 --> 56:27.640
Urgent?

56:27.880 --> 56:29.360
His feet.

56:29.600 --> 56:32.200
Feet?

56:33.640 --> 56:37.040
- I'll take you to him.
- Lf it's urgent.

56:37.280 --> 56:41.480
It is urgent.
The gentleman is in pain.

56:41.840 --> 56:43.240
My condolences.

56:43.480 --> 56:47.480
Thank you. That is most kind of you.

57:20.040 --> 57:21.120
Good afternoon.

57:21.360 --> 57:25.000
My name is Stevens.
I'm hoping there's a letter for me.

57:25.240 --> 57:29.680
- I'll just check for you, sir.
- James Stevens.

57:30.240 --> 57:33.800
- I'd like two apples, please.
- There you are, Mr. Stevens.

57:34.040 --> 57:37.520
- You are touring in these parts?
- I'm on my way to Clevedon.

57:37.760 --> 57:40.920
- How much is that?
- That'll be threepence, please.

57:41.160 --> 57:43.200
And you'd be coming from...?

57:43.440 --> 57:45.240
- Oxfordshire.
- Whereabouts?

57:45.480 --> 57:48.120
- Sorry?
- Whereabouts in Oxfordshire?

57:48.360 --> 57:49.360
Darlington.

57:49.600 --> 57:53.120
That rings a bell. Wasn't there
a Lord Darlington? Some sort...

57:53.360 --> 57:56.160
...of Nazi, got us in the war?

57:56.400 --> 57:58.760
I'm the butler there,
and my employer...

57:59.000 --> 58:02.640
...is Mr. Lewis, an American gentleman.

58:03.480 --> 58:06.560
I didn't know the former owner.

58:06.800 --> 58:09.360
Your change.

58:27.560 --> 58:32.040
<i>I should be glad to meet you at the
Sea View Hotel, opposite the pier.</i>

58:32.280 --> 58:36.400
<i>We'll have such a lot to talk about, 
and I'll have many questions.</i>

58:36.640 --> 58:40.560
<i>Ex cept for you, I've lost touch with
all our friends at Darlington Hall.</i>

58:40.800 --> 58:41.840
<i>But that's no wonder.</i>

58:42.080 --> 58:45.840
<i>It was long ago and a lot
has happened in between.</i>

58:46.080 --> 58:50.040
<i>Who could keep track of all the people
His Lordship once employed?</i>

58:50.280 --> 58:51.560
My lord, you rang?

58:51.800 --> 58:55.240
- Have the young German ladies arrived?
- They're outside.

58:55.480 --> 58:58.320
I'd like to say hello to them,
practise my German.

58:58.560 --> 59:04.120
- They do speak excellent English.
- Good. Well, ask them to come in.

59:14.360 --> 59:18.000
This is Elsa and this is Irma.

59:19.200 --> 59:22.440
I'm asking about their journey.

59:23.800 --> 59:26.920
It was long, my lord.

59:30.760 --> 59:32.360
I asked if they like the weather.

59:32.600 --> 59:37.960
We are grateful to you, my lord,
for letting us come here.

59:38.080 --> 59:40.160
Our parents are very grateful.

59:40.400 --> 59:43.320
Not at all.
Miss Kenton will look after you.

59:43.560 --> 59:45.240
- Won't you?
- Indeed, my lord.

59:45.480 --> 59:48.120
Welcome to Darlington Hall.

59:48.880 --> 59:52.760
- Thank you, my lord.
- Thank you, my lord.

59:53.480 --> 59:56.560
Will there be anything else?

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.320
Sir Geoffrey.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.240
Good to see you.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.160
How do you do?

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.440
Well, come in.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.440
- Mr. Benn.
- Mr. Stevens.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.840
Gentlemen, if you'd like to wait
here for a while.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.400
- Aren't you still at Stanton Lacey?
- I'm with Sir Geoffrey now.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.240
- You haven't changed one bit.
- I'll let you get on.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.480
- Perhaps we'll meet later.
- I hope so.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.120
But, gentlemen, you speak of Jews
and Gypsies, Negroes and so forth.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.920
But one has to regard the racial
laws of the Fascists...

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:06.520
...as a sanitary measure,
much overdue, in my opinion.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.760
Imagine trying to enforce
such a rule in this country...

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.120
You cannot run a country
without a penal system.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.760
Here we call them prisons. There,
they call them concentration camps.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.400
Is there any meat
of any kind in this soup?

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.640
I think it's mushroom stock, sir.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.640
Mushroom ends and skins,
onion and celery. No meat at all.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.920
Cold water, and then cook adds sherry.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.720
I hear you have a Labour fellow
from your constituency.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.840
Over there, they've got rid of
all that trade union rubbish.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.640
Believe me, no workers strike
in Germany.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.920
And everyone's kept in line.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.040
No wonder this country
is going down the drain.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.400
It is internally diseased.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.720
I think there may be butter
in the croutons. Do you know?

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.520
I'm afraid there may be.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.840
You've made a cozy little nest here.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.160
Seems to me you must be
a well-contented man.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.440
In my philosophy, Mr. Benn...

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.200
...a man cannot call himself
well-contented...

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.440
...until he has done all he can...

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.840
...to be of service to his employer.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.200
This assumes that one's employer...

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.440
...is a superior person
not only in rank or wealth...

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.200
...but in moral stature.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.000
And in your opinion, what's going on
up there has "moral stature"?

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.520
I wish I could be sure.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.840
But I'm not.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.120
I've heard some very fishy things.
Very fishy.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.800
I hear nothing.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.440
Listen.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.120
That's so touching, isn't it?

01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:01.640
To listen to the gentlemen
would distract me from my work.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.960
It's fresh soda.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.200
Would you be joining us?

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.160
Thank you, but it's very late
and I have an early start.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.640
Good night.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:26.360
- Good night, Mr. Stevens.
- Good night, Miss Kenton.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.280
Good-looking woman.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.120
It was never the same
after she left Stanton Lacey.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.480
I handed in my own notice
six months later.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.480
I'd be lost without her.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.120
A first-rate housekeeper
is essential in a house like this...

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.480
...where great affairs are decided
between these walls.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.000
- Good morning.
- My lord.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.960
<i>"We do the Jews no injustice when we
say that the revelation of Christ...</i>

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.760
<i>... is something incomprehensible
and hateful to them.</i>

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.440
<i>Though He apparently sprang
from their midst...</i>

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.120
<i>... He embodies the negation of their
whole nature.</i>

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.840
<i>The Jews are far more sensitive
about this than we are.</i>

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.840
<i>This demonstration of the cleft that
separates us Europeans from the Jew...</i>

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.040
<i>... is not given in order
to let religious prejudice...</i>

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.800
<i>... with its dangerous bias, 
settle the matter...</i>

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.600
<i>... but because the perception of
two fundamentally different natures...</i>

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.360
<i>... reveals a real gulf."</i>

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.640
We have some refugee girls
on the staff now, I believe.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.040
We do.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.120
Two housemaids, Elsa and Irma.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.080
You'll have to let them go,
I'm afraid.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.680
Let them go, my lord?

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.000
It's regrettable,
but we have no choice.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.440
You must see the whole thing
in context.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:39.240
I have the well-being
of my guests to consider.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.640
May I say...

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.720
...they work extremely well.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.720
They're intelligent, polite
and very clean.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.720
I'm sorry, but I've looked
into this matter very carefully.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.480
There are larger issues at stake.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.120
I'm sorry, but there it is.

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.240
They're Jews.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.520
Yes, my lord.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.440
I'm amazed you can stand
there as if...

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:18.360
...you were discussing orders
for the larder. I can't believe it!

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.520
Elsa and Irma are to be dismissed
because they're Jewish?

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:26.240
His Lordship has decided. There's
nothing for you and I to discuss.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.600
Without work, they could be
sent back to Germany.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.080
It is out of our hands.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.000
I tell you, if you dismiss my girls
tomorrow, it will be wrong!

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.040
A sin, as any sin ever was one!

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.320
There are many things you and I
don't understand in this world.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.560
His Lordship understands fully and has
studied the larger issues at stake...

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.240
...concerning, say...

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.840
...the nature of Jewry.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.360
I warn you...

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.160
...if those girls go...

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.760
...I shall leave this house.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.760
Please.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.640
These references,
I have to tell you...

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.320
...are quite reserved.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.200
Why did you leave
your last employment?

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.800
- They didn't want me anymore.
- Why not?

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.920
I don't know.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.960
They just didn't want me anymore.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.720
They say she works well.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.000
Would you please wait outside?

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.840
- She's unsuitable.
- Not at all. I want her.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.800
- She'll be under my supervision.
- She's not suitable.

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.720
She'll do well. I'll see to it.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:19.359
Well, then, it is entirely
your responsibility.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:23.680
Weren't you leaving
because of the German girls?

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.680
I'm not leaving.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:30.160
I've nowhere to go. I have no family.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:32.319
I'm a coward.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.040
Yes. I am a coward.

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:39.200
I'm frightened of leaving,
and that's the truth.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:44.520
All I see out in the world
is loneliness, and it frightens me.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.240
That's all my high principles
are worth.

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:52.439
I'm ashamed of myself.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.800
You mean a great deal to this house.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.040
You're extremely important
to this house.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:19.080
Am I?

01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:25.760
Now, look here...

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.880
...if you're really sure about
this young woman, call her back in.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.720
Miss Hull, we would like you
to start next week.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.640
You're responsible to Miss Kenton.
She'll explain the house rules.

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.320
Number one: no gentlemen callers,
or other such.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.240
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.720
- Welcome.
- Thank you, sir.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.680
Well done.
I'll show you to your room.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.360
I'd forgotten how much petrol
the Daimler uses.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.000
It's an impractical motor to be
going about the country, Mister...

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.840
Smith. Harry Smith. It's a privilege
to have you here in Moscombe.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.640
- It's a privilege to be here.
- Your health, sir.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.960
Dr. Carlisle usually drops in
around now. He'd enjoy meeting you.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.360
He's a gentleman like yourself.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.880
I don't know what you call
a gentleman.

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:23.240
It's a name every man
in this country has a right to.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.040
There's Harry Smith now, giving
you an earful of his philosophy.

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.520
We English...

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:32.320
...have the advantage and privilege
of expressing our opinions...

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.440
...and voting for Parliament.
That's what we fought Hitler for.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.520
Have you had much to do
with politics yourself?

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:45.120
Not directly as such, no,
particularly in these days.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.360
Perhaps more so in the early 1930s
and just before the war.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:52.520
My concern was more
international affairs.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.800
Or foreign policy, so to speak.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.800
Not that I ever held high office,
mind you.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.080
No, any influence I exerted
was in an unofficial capacity.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.040
Excuse me, sir.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.160
Have you ever met Mr. Churchill?

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.720
He came to the house occasionally.
Again, in the early 1930s.

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.840
He was a bloody warmonger!

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:22.040
Honestly, Harry! We wouldn't have won
the war without him.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.680
Not content to fight Germans,
he sent troops in against the miners.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.440
- What about the war?
- Yes, all right.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.440
He did well in the war,
but he should've stepped down.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.720
- And Mr. Eden?
- He made a right bugger of Suez!

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.600
Yes, I met Mr. Eden.
Yes, occasionally.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:39.840
How do you do? Richard Carlisle.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.000
Rotten luck about your car,
but nice to have you.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.360
- Everyone has been most kind.
- He says he knows foreign affairs.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.240
Is that so, indeed?

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.400
In an unofficial capacity.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:55.240
- He knows Mr. Churchill.
- And Mr. Eden.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:57.440
Really?

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:01.960
Yes, well, it was my good fortune
to have consorted...

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:07.640
...with many men of influence
from Europe and from America.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.000
Mr. Taylor...

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:16.360
...I really feel I ought to retire now
because I'm feeling rather tired.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.600
No wonder, sir.
Running out of petrol...

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.200
...then having to hear Smith's
political opinions.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.840
Just step this way, sir.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.840
I'm going to Stanbury in the
morning. I'll give you a lift...

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.800
...and we could pick up
a can of petrol on the way.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.920
- I'd hate to inconvenience you.
- Not at all. Would 7:30 suit you?

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:40.360
You'll enjoy talking to Dr. Carlisle.
Watch this step.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.600
Excuse Harry Smith.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.040
He will go on about his politics.
I don't mean he's not right.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:49.400
Democracy is why we fought Hitler, and
we lost a few lads in this village...

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.600
...including our son here.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.960
Dunkirk.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.840
I'll get you a blanket.

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:03.000
I've left a razor and soap
on the basin.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.400
Listen to the opinions
of your man in the street.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.240
They're perfectly entitled
to give an opinion...

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.960
...on politics or whatever questions...

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.160
They've got no qualifications!

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.720
Of course they have!

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.640
Mr. Spencer would like
a word with you.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:57.000
My good man,
I have a question for you.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.520
Do you suppose the debt situation
regarding America...

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.040
...factors significantly in the
present low levels of trade?

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.960
Or is this a red herring...

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:12.080
...and the abandonment of the gold
standard is the cause of the problem?

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.760
I'm sorry, sir, but I am unable
to be of assistance in this matter.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.200
Oh, dear.
What a pity.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.960
Perhaps you'd help us
on another matter.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.920
Do you think...

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.400
...Europe's currency problem would be
alleviated by an arms agreement...

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.240
...between the French
and the Bolsheviks?

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:38.200
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm unable
to be of assistance in this matter.

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.080
Very well, that'll be all.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.960
One moment, Darlington, I have another
question to put to our good man here.

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.120
My good fellow...

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.320
...do you share our opinion...

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:54.000
...that M. Daladier's recent speech
on North Africa...

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.600
...was simply a ruse...

01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:00.640
...to scupper the nationalist fringe
of his own domestic party?

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.840
I'm sorry, sir. I am unable
to help in any of these matters.

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:09.400
You see, our good man here is
"unable to assist us in these matters."

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:12.400
Yet we still go along
with the notion...

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.000
...that this nation's decisions
be left to our good man here...

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.440
...and a few millions like him.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:24.400
You may as well ask the Mothers'
Union to organize a war campaign.

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.840
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:33.600
You certainly proved your point.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.120
- Q.E.D., I think.
- No, not at all!

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.400
Oh, yes, he has!

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.760
What did you make of the citizens
of Moscombe? Not a bad bunch.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:47.840
No, sir.

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.640
Mr. And Mrs. Taylor
were extremely kind.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.240
I say, I hope you don't
think me very rude...

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.760
...but you aren't a manservant
of some sort, are you?

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.400
Yes, sir. I am, indeed.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:10.000
In fact, I'm the butler
of Darlington Hall, near Oxford.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.720
It wasn't my intention
to deceive anyone.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.120
Don't explain.
I can see how it happened.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.200
Darlington.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.640
Wasn't there a
Lord Darlington involved...

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:24.320
...in that appeasement business
that got us into the war?

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.960
Sorry, I never knew
that Lord Darlington.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:32.080
My employer's an American
gentleman, Mr. Lewis.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.480
Lord Darlington was among those who
tried to make a deal with Hitler.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.440
Then there was a case after the war...

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:42.680
...where he sued a newspaper
for libel.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.880
"The Express", was it?
"News Chronicle"?

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.760
- I couldn't say, sir.
- Anyway, he lost.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.200
He was lucky, really, not to have
been tried for treason.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.120
There it is, just ahead.

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.880
Sir, I must confess...

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.080
...that I failed to tell
you the truth.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:21.680
I did know Lord Darlington, and I can
declare that he was a truly good man.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:24.040
A gentleman through and through...

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:28.920
...to whom I'm proud to have given
my best years of service.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:35.920
That should get you
to the next petrol station.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.080
Thank you very much, sir.
I'm most grateful.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.800
But did you...

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.280
...share his opinions?

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.840
Who?

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.520
Lord Darlington.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.440
I was his butler.
I was there to serve him...

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.080
...not to agree or disagree.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.200
You trusted him.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.760
Yes, I did. Completely.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.160
But at the end of his life, he himself
admitted that he'd been... mistaken.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.400
That he'd been too gullible,
and he'd let himself be taken in.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.440
I see.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:14.560
Thank you, sir.
You've been most kind.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:27.560
Just keep going straight up here,
and turn left at the first crossroads.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.640
I say, I don't want to be a bore,
but I'm intrigued.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.880
Where do you stand on all that?

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:37.200
If a mistake was to be made, wouldn't
you rather have made your own?

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.480
Forgive me for being so inquisitive.

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:41.080
Not at all, sir.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.240
In a very small way,
I did make my own mistake.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.440
But I might have a chance
to set mine right.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.320
In fact, I'm on my way
to try and do so now.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.880
Try the ignition.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.680
Thank you, sir.
I'm most grateful for your help.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:07.000
Good luck.
It's been interesting talking to you.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.040
Good morning.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.880
Lord Halifax was impressed
with the silver.

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:47.320
I told him it was all your doing.
Sent his compliments. Well done.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.000
I've been meaning to ask you...

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:56.640
That business last year
about the Jewish maids...

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:59.480
...I suppose there's no way
of tracing them?

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.680
That would be difficult. I tried
to get them a position in Surrey.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:08.000
There was room only for one,
and they didn't want to be separated.

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.760
Well, try anyway. One would like
to do something for them.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.360
It was wrong, what occurred.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.040
I'm sorry about it. Very sorry.

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:24.200
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.160
He asked about the Jewish girls.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:31.280
- Elsa and Irma?
- He wondered where they were.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.600
He said it was wrong
to dismiss them.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.440
I remember you were
as distressed as I was about it.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.600
As you were?

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:44.600
You thought it was right and proper
that they should be sent packing.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.040
Now, really, that is most unfair.

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.480
Of course I was upset.
Very much so.

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.640
I don't like that happening here.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:56.880
I wish you'd told me. It would've
helped me to know you felt as I did.

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:01.640
Why do you always have to hide
what you feel?

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.240
Have you finished the lavender bags?
Good.

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:12.080
All right.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.400
I take my hat off to you.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:30.920
That girl's come along very well.
You were right and I was wrong.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.880
- Look at that smile on your face.
- What smile?

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.120
That tells a story in itself.

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.480
Wouldn't you say so?

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:42.800
What story's that?

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.200
She's a pretty girl, don't you think?

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.880
Is she?

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:51.400
You don't like pretty girls
on the staff. I've noticed.

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:56.040
Might it be that our Mr. Stevens
fears distraction?

01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:01.400
Can it be that Mr. Stevens is flesh
and blood and cannot trust himself?

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.760
You know what I'm doing?

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.200
I'm placing my thoughts elsewhere
while you chatter away.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.640
Why is that guilty smile
still on your face?

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.840
Not guilty, simply amused
by the nonsense you sometimes talk.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.360
It is a guilty smile.
You can't bear to look at her.

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.080
You didn't want her.
She was too pretty.

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.880
You must be right.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.080
You always are.

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.840
Charlie!

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:51.680
Lizzie, aren't you supposed to be
turning down the beds?

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:55.840
Well, you better get on with it, then.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.280
Have you told her yet?
You better get on with it, then.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.880
What can I say to her?
She'd never understand.

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:09.360
- Why not?
- She's old. She must be at least 30.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.160
Perhaps she doesn't feel old.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.960
Who do you think those flowers
are for she's been picking?

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:19.080
Come here. Give us a kiss.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.720
Flowers.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.280
Flowers.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.880
You're reading.

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.880
It's very dim. Can you see?

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.880
Yes, thank you.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.680
What are you reading?

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.880
A book.

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:47.560
Yes, but what sort of book?

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:52.040
It's a book, Miss Kenton.
A book.

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:56.600
What's the book?

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:00.080
Are you shy about your book?

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.040
What is it?

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.880
Is it racy?

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:08.280
Racy?

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:12.240
Are you reading a racy book?

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:16.160
Do you think racy books are to be
found in His Lordship's shelves?

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.760
How would I know?

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.240
What is it?

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.360
Let me see it.
Let me see your book.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.480
Please leave me alone.

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:29.880
Why won't you show me your book?

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.560
This is my private time.
You're invading it.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.360
Is that so?

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:38.200
I'm invading your private time,
am I?

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.040
What's in that book?

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:43.400
Come on, let me see.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.240
Or are you protecting me?
Is that what you're doing?

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:50.640
Would I be shocked?

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:54.480
Would it ruin my character?

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:58.920
Let me see it.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.480
Oh, dear.

01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.360
It's not scandalous at all.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.000
It's just a sentimental
old love story.

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.640
I read these books...

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:44.680
...any books...

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:48.760
...to develop my command and knowledge
of the English language.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I read to further my education,
Miss Kenton.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:00.000
I really must ask you, please...

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:05.200
...not to disturb the few moments
I have to myself.

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.200
Come in.

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.800
What is it?

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:44.040
I'm wanting to give you
my notice, please.

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.480
Why?

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.240
Charlie and me, we're getting married.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.560
Have you thought about this carefully?

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:59.320
Yes, Miss Kenton, I have.

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:04.000
You've been getting on well here and
could have a fine career before you.

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.040
Charlie and me's getting married.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.080
Charlie and I.

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.080
I wish I knew what to say to you.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.680
I've seen this happen so many times.

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.760
A young girl rushing into marriage
only to be disappointed in the end.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.600
What about money?

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.360
We don't have any.

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.600
But who cares?

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.560
You'll find it's not easy
to live poor.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.160
We have each other.

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.920
That's all anyone can ever need.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.160
Very well.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:46.280
If you're so sure.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:49.320
Thank you.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:56.640
Good luck.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.040
We did all we could for them.

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.080
I told him...

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.680
...I had my eye on him
as a possible under-butler...

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.360
...in a year or so.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.360
But, no, Mr. Charlie knows best.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:28.160
She's sure to be let down.

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.680
No use crying over spilt milk.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:35.280
Besides, we have far more
important matters to discuss.

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.080
- Next week's meeting. Now...
- Must we discuss it tonight?

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.840
Sorry?

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:46.400
I'm tired.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:50.480
I've had a busy day.
Don't you realize that?

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.440
I'm very tired.

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.760
I'm very, very tired.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.160
Don't you understand?

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:08.080
I owe you an apology.
I thought...

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.360
...these quiet evening talks
were useful to our work.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.160
But now I see that they're
a burden to you.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.840
I was only saying I was tired tonight.

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:19.880
No, no. You're right.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:22.680
Our meetings are a burden
after a long day.

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:25.880
Perhaps we'd better discontinue them.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.400
They're useful.
It was only tonight.

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:30.200
I thank you for the cocoa.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.680
In the future, we shall communicate
only during the day.

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:36.760
If necessary, by written message.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.320
I wish you a very good night.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.800
I shall be taking my day off tomorrow.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.680
I'll be back in the house by 9:30.

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:51.200
Certainly.

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:52.880
Certainly.

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.840
Good night.

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.240
I'm glad to be out of it,
I can tell you.

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:35.160
There was something about Sir Geoffrey
and his Black Shirts...

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.360
...gave me the creeps.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.880
Mr. Stevens says we should
run the house...

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:44.120
...and leave the rest
where it belongs.

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:47.760
You don't agree, Mr. Benn.

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:51.000
Nor do l, really.

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.880
If I don't like something,
I want to say "stuff it"...

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.680
...if you'll pardon the expression,
Miss Kenton.

01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:03.680
But then I suppose I'm not
a real professional, like Mr. Stevens.

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:07.840
It's Mr. Stevens' whole life.

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.680
Well, it's not mine.

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.840
And to tell you the truth...

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.960
...I don't want to go back in service.

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.280
- What would you do instead, Mr. Benn?
- Tom's the name.

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.880
Tom.

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.200
What employment would you take up?

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.880
I'd really like to be on my own.

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:33.480
Start a little shop somewhere,
newspapers and tobacco.

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:37.760
Or a boarding house in the
west country, where I come from.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.680
Clevedon's a good place for
a boarding house.

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.840
Would I get you another shandy?

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.200
Well, it's almost 9:30...

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.880
Go on!

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.680
It's your day off, isn't it?

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.560
You're not in the army,
due back in the barracks.

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.920
- All right, then.
- Good.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:59.840
Half a shandy, please.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.680
What about yourself, then, Sarah?

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.840
That's a serious sort of a name.

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.280
They called me Sally
when my mum was alive.

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:23.680
Sally. That's nice.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.600
Is it your intention
to remain in service?

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.360
It's a good profession,
when you have a position.

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:36.240
- Mr. Stevens says we're fortunate...
- We're not talking about him.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.800
We're talking about you.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.600
Supposing...

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:45.640
...someone asked if you'd like to come
in on a boarding house by the sea?

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:48.760
What would you say?

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:50.200
Well, I don't know.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.080
It's a theoretical question,
so I haven't given it any thought...

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.640
...Mr. Benn.
- Tom.

01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:00.880
Supposing it wasn't theoretical...

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.520
...Sally?

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.200
It's been years since I've been
called that. It feels funny.

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:10.200
Nice, though?

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:38.160
It's very late.

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:21.480
Will there be anything else?

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.200
What?

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:31.960
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, my lord.

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:46.480
Mr. Cardinal, good evening.

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:48.280
- How are you?
- Very well.

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:52.480
- Delighted. And your wife?
- Very well too, sir.

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.400
- How are you?
- Very well, sir.

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:58.160
I've gone and got myself in a bit
of a mess with arrangements.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.160
Would His Lordship put me up?

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.560
I'll tell him you're here.

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.600
I hope there's nothing special tonight.

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:07.320
His Lordship expects
some gentlemen after dinner.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.480
I'll keep my head down, then.
I've got to write my column anyway.

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.960
- You're in time for dinner, if you like.
- I hoped I would be.

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.080
How is my godfather? Fit?

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.280
Very well. Some refreshment?

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.880
Thank you.
Some whisky would be lovely.

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:25.800
- Who's he expecting tonight?
- I am unable to help you there.

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.000
What, no idea?

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.080
No idea at all, sir.

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:35.840
- I'll keep my head down all the same.
- I think it's a good idea, sir.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.560
Come in.

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:45.440
Mr. Cardinal has just arrived,
out of the blue.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.480
He'll expect his usual room.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.520
- I'll see to it before I leave.
- You're going out?

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:52.760
I am indeed.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.040
It's Thursday.

01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.520
Of course. I'd forgotten. Sorry.

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:59.760
Is something the matter?

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.080
Some visitors are arriving,
but it doesn't involve you.

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.240
We agreed that Thursday
is my day off...

01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:09.760
...but if you need me urgently...

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.800
No, it's perfectly all right.
Thank you.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.680
I have something to tell you.

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:23.000
My friend...

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:25.840
...the man I'm meeting, Mr. Benn.

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:29.560
Mr. Benn. Of course. Yes.

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:36.200
He has asked me to marry him.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.720
I am thinking about it.

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:43.720
I see.

01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:47.760
He's moving to the west country
next month.

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.720
I'm still thinking about it.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.240
I thought you should be informed
of the situation.

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.480
Yes, thank you.

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.560
That's most kind of you.

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:17.400
I trust you'll have
a most pleasant evening.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:33.000
Is there something special tonight?

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.040
Are your visitors special?

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:39.280
Can't tell you, my boy.
Strictly confidential.

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:42.520
- So I can't sit in on it?
- On what?

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:46.760
- Whatever it is that's taking place.
- Absolutely not.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.320
Can't have someone like you sticking
your nose in. A journalist.

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.080
What do you call it, a "newshound"?

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:55.440
No, it wouldn't do at all.

01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:00.120
Once you've had your food,
you'd better make yourself scarce.

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:04.000
It sounds pretty special to me.

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:33.440
Good evening, prime minister.

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:35.760
- Sorry, we've been delayed.
- I understand.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.960
Lord Halifax.

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:42.440
- Very nice to see you.
- This is Mr. Fraser.

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:55.720
Good evening, Your Excellency.

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:05.040
Please wait here, Your Excellency.
I'll inform His Lordship.

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.960
We don't intend to involve
the whole British Empire in a war...

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:59.760
...simply because of a quarrel
in a faraway country...

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.680
...between people of whom
we know nothing.

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:06.360
To my mind, the whole
of Czechoslovakia...

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.080
...isn't worth a single
one of our own young men.

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.840
We have a small, noisy
and corrupt war group here...

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:18.400
...who don't realize that you Germans
are marching into your own back yard.

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.320
The "Führer" is a man of peace
to the depth of his soul...

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:26.520
...but he won't allow
a small second-rate country...

01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:32.000
...to thumb its nose
at the 1000-year German Reich.

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.640
I'll get it.

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:49.560
Come on, wake up!

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:52.240
Stay awake!

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:01.640
Could you confirm that this lady
is on the staff here?

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.760
Yes, of course.
She's the housekeeper.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.040
Thank you, sir.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:08.160
- May I?
- Of course.

01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:09.760
Sorry to have alarmed you.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.520
Just security, miss.

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.680
I trust you've had a pleasant evening.

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.960
Well, did you have a pleasant evening?

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:26.680
- Yes, thank you.
- Good.

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:30.680
Would you like to know
what took place?

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.880
I have to return upstairs.

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:37.720
There are important events
taking place tonight.

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:41.160
When are there not?

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.480
I accepted his proposal.

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.880
I accepted Mr. Benn's proposal
of marriage.

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:51.160
My congratulations.

01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.360
I am prepared to serve out my notice.

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:56.960
But if you'd release me earlier,
I'd be grateful.

01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:01.040
Mr. Benn is planning to leave
for the west country in two weeks.

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:03.320
I'll do my best.

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:06.640
Now, please excuse me.

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.800
After all the years I have been here,
you have nothing else to say?

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:22.600
You have my warmest congratulations.

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:26.840
You've been a very important figure...

01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:29.480
...for Mr. Benn and me.

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:31.720
Oh, in what way?

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.920
I tell him all sorts
of things about you.

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:39.120
I tell him stories about you.
About your habits.

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.040
About your mannerisms.

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:44.360
He finds it very funny,
especially when I show him how...

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:47.560
...you pinch your nose
when you put pepper on your food.

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.760
That always has us in stitches.

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:58.720
Does it, indeed?

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.520
Well, please...

01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:06.560
...excuse me, Miss Kenton.

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:09.240
Good night.

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:33.040
Thanks.

01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:38.960
We've been friends a long time,
haven't we?

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:42.160
I always look forward to a chat
when I come here.

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.840
Would you care to join me in a drink?

01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:47.160
That's most kind of you,
but no, thank you.

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:48.640
You all right?

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:50.160
I'm perfectly all right.

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:53.440
Not feeling unwell, are you?

01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:54.960
A little tired, perhaps.

01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:57.920
I bet you're tired.
What is it, about 1:00?

01:44:58.160 --> 01:44:59.560
Come on.

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:01.280
I want you to sit down.

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:04.360
Well, sir, I really...

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.040
I didn't come here by accident.

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:14.360
You know that.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.160
I had a tip-off, you see...

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:21.080
...about what's going on now
in the library.

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:24.160
I wish you'd sit down.
I'm your friend...

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:28.040
...and you're holding that tray
as if you're about to wander off!

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.680
Now, come on.
Sit down, damn it!

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:35.800
That's better.

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:40.520
Now, look, I don't suppose the prime
minister is in the library, is he?

01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:43.040
Prime minister, sir?

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:45.480
In the library...
You don't have to confirm it...

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:50.680
...are our prime minister, our foreign
secretary and the German ambassador.

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:53.920
- Any idea what they're talking about?
- I'm afraid not.

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:56.720
Tell me, Stevens,
don't you care at all?

01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:59.160
Aren't you in the least bit curious?

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:02.160
It's not my place to be curious
about such matters.

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.280
Not your place.

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:06.760
And supposing I told you
that His Lordship...

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.160
...is trying to persuade
the prime minister...

01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:12.880
...to enter into a pact with that
bunch of criminals in Berlin?

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:16.920
I'm certain His Lordship is acting
from the highest and noblest motives.

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:20.480
Don't you see? That's exactly
what makes it so abominable!

01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:24.680
Twisting these high and noble
motives to their own foul ends!

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:28.320
You do, please, realize
that His Lordship's been the most...

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:31.920
...valuable pawn that the Nazis
have in this country...

01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:35.240
...precisely because he is good
and honourable?

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:39.120
If I weren't so drunk,
I could make you understand!

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:40.640
Sir...

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:43.240
...I do understand.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.360
His Lordship is working
to ensure peace in our time.

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:49.520
Peace in our time
on their beastly terms!

01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:52.280
Remember that American here
at the conference?

01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:55.440
Called Lord Darlington an amateur,
out of his depth?

01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:56.840
Well, he was right.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:58.920
He was dead right.

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.720
I hardly have to tell you
how I feel towards His Lordship.

01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:06.280
I care about him deeply,
and I know you do too.

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:07.600
Yes, I do indeed.

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:11.440
Then aren't you desperate
to see him make this mistake?

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:18.080
He's being tricked! Don't you see?
Or are you as deluded as he is?

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:20.720
Oh, dear. Now I've probably
offended you.

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.240
No. Not at all, sir.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.120
Not at all.

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:32.080
You must excuse me.

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:37.200
There are other gentlemen
calling for me, sir.

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:09.760
You mustn't take anything
I said to heart.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.160
I was very foolish a little while ago.

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.040
I haven't taken anything
you said to heart.

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:23.720
In fact, I can hardly recall
anything you did say.

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:26.280
I was just being very foolish.

01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:32.680
I simply haven't time to stand here
with you, engaging in idle talk.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.760
I suggest you go to bed now.
You must be very tired.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.800
Good night.

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.720
Oh, damn it!

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:22.400
Blast!

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.160
I'd been wanting to tell you...

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:38.760
It's the small alcove outside
the breakfast room.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.760
It's the new girl, of course...

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.880
...but I find it has not
been dusted in some time.

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.520
I'll see to it.

01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:53.320
Thank you.

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:57.720
I knew you would have wanted
to be informed.

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:41.280
Hello, Sally.

01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:43.360
Hi, Tom.

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:45.040
You all right, then?

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:46.480
How are you?

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:49.320
I'm good.

01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:54.160
Could we talk for a moment, please?
Just for a moment.

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:56.640
We'll have to be quick
because I'm going out.

01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:59.360
It won't take long.

01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:03.600
All right, then.
We'll have to go into the lounge.

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:09.840
Afternoon.

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.440
Nice little place, isn't it?

01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:21.840
The sort of quiet little
boarding house I had in mind for us.

01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:25.560
Like other things, it didn't work out.

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:29.240
What did you want to say?

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:34.920
I saw Catherine yesterday.
She had some interesting news.

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.440
She's expecting.

01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:39.080
Oh, my goodness!

01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:47.000
She wants us both over
for tea on Sunday.

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:50.640
I could come and get you.

01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:53.720
We could go together on the bus.

01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:57.320
Yes, well, we'll see about that.

01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:02.440
House is that empty without you.

01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:06.160
I can't tell you.

01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:10.160
You cut yourself shaving.

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:12.120
Oh, yeah. I know.

01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:15.920
Can't seem to do anything right
these days.

01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:26.160
<i>I so often think
of the good old days...</i>

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:28.760
<i>... when I was housekeeper
at Darlington Hall.</i>

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.120
<i>Those years with you
were the happiest of my life.</i>

01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:34.520
Would you like more tea?

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.680
Yes, please. Thank you.

01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:38.840
Miss Kenton.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Benn.

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:41.760
- Sorry, I was delayed.
- That's all right.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.360
Please sit down.

01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:48.320
- I've ordered some fresh tea.
- Lovely.

01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:50.440
Would you like some cake?

01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:53.280
- Sure?
- All right. It's a special occasion.

01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.840
Good.

01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:56.960
Waitress?

01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:01.360
- Could we have some cake?
- Yes, of course.

01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:04.440
- It's been a long time.
- Yes, indeed.

01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:07.800
You haven't changed at all.

01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:09.760
A little, perhaps.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.560
We've all changed, I think.

01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:15.120
I'd have known you anywhere.

01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:20.960
How long's it been?
Twenty years?

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:23.120
Yes, just over, I think.

01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:26.640
The tea should be along.

01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:48.840
We read about the suit for libel.

01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:51.080
It's a shame...

01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:54.960
...calling His Lordship a traitor.
Those papers will print anything.

01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:58.280
They should have lost the case.

01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:00.560
When His Lordship went to court...

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:05.280
...he sincerely expected
he would get justice.

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:08.320
Instead, the newspaper increased
its circulation, and His Lordship's...

01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:12.240
...good name was destroyed forever.

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:15.560
Afterwards, in his last years, well...

01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:18.560
...quite honestly, Mrs. Benn...

01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.520
...his heart was broken.

01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:25.320
I'd take him tea in the library,
and he'd be sitting there...

01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:30.320
...and he wouldn't even see me,
so deep was he in his own thoughts.

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:35.560
And he'd be talking to himself,
as though he was arguing with someone.

01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:38.280
There was no one, of course.

01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:41.160
No one came to see him anymore.

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:45.120
What about his godson,
young Mr. Cardinal?

01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:47.720
Mr. Cardinal was killed in the war.
Waitress.

01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:51.120
May I have my bill, please?

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.800
I'm very sorry.

01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:05.960
I know you remember Darlington Hall
in its best days...

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:10.280
...and that's how His Lordship
deserves to be remembered.

01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:13.800
But perhaps the good days are back,
now that Mr. Lewis is here...

01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:16.040
...and Mrs. Lewis is arriving shortly.

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:19.040
Very fortunate to have you
running the house.

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:23.680
We still have problems, Miss Kenton.
I'm sorry. Mrs. Benn.

01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:29.640
- We still have staff problems.
- You mentioned it in your letter.

01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:33.760
Frankly, I've been thinking
of going back in service.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.680
Good...

01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:38.760
But now the situation
has changed for me.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.480
If I take up any work,
it will have to be...

01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:44.120
...here in the west country...

01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:49.840
...because Catherine, our daughter,
is expecting a baby.

01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:52.200
So I would like to be near her.

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:54.280
Of course.

01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:57.360
And to be near our grandchild
as he grows up.

01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:03.480
- Naturally.
- Or her, if it's a little girl.

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:12.280
When I left Darlington Hall,
all those years ago...

01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:16.440
...I never realized I was really,
truly leaving.

01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:20.160
I believe I thought of it
as simply another ruse...

01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:23.240
...to annoy you.

01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:27.240
It was a shock to come out here
and find myself actually married.

01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:29.480
For a long time, I was...

01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:32.360
...very unhappy.

01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.880
But then Catherine was born,
the years went by and one day...

01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:39.120
...I realized I loved my husband.

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:42.320
You see, there is no one...

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:48.000
...no one in the world who needs me
as much as he does.

01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:51.360
But still there are times...

01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:57.080
...when I think I made a terrible
mistake with my life.

01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:01.080
I'm sure we all have these thoughts...

01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:04.160
...from time to time.

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:41.040
People always cheer when they turn
the lights on in the evening.

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:43.920
I wonder why.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.840
They do say...

01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:50.120
...that for many people, the evening's
the best part of the day.

01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.880
The part they most look forward to.

01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:56.280
Is that so?

01:59:56.280 --> 02:00:00.880
What do you most look forward to?

02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:06.120
Getting back to Darlington Hall,
principally...

02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:08.880
...and straightening out
our staff problems.

02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:12.160
You were always able to do that.

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:17.000
And you had quite a few
to straighten out, as I remember.

02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:22.120
Always was work, work
and more work...

02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:26.680
...and will continue to be so,
I have no doubt.

02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:41.560
Mr. Stevens, don't you wait!
That bus is always late.

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:45.040
Come in out of the wet.

02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:53.720
You must take good care of yourself.

02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:57.760
- You too, promise me that.
- Oh, yes, I promise.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.080
Do all you can to make these years
happy for yourself and your husband.

02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:05.320
We may never meet again, Mrs. Benn.

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:10.480
That is why I am being personal,
if you will forgive me.

02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:12.560
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:16.880
Oh, here it comes.
It's on time for once.

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:39.360
Thank you. And thank you
so very much for coming.

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:41.360
It was so very kind of you.

02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:43.120
It was so nice to see you.

02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:46.760
It was a pleasure to see you again.
Goodbye.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.480
Take care.

02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:38.000
You scared me.
Where'd you come from?

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.040
You like the suit?

02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:41.920
Very good, sir.

02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:50.600
Good.

02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:56.400
Watch the chandelier there.

02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:10.800
You're really getting things
going here. This is wonderful!

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.960
I've had to ask another three girls
from the village to come up.

02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:18.560
And I can promise you that
the house will be ready...

02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:21.120
...and in shape by the time
Mrs. Lewis arrives.

02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:24.080
That sounds good.

02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.240
I'm expecting a possible
new housekeeper this afternoon.

02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:29.080
A Mrs. Ruth Muspratt.

02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:34.160
Excellent references. She was matron
at a boys' school in Sussex.

02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:37.080
A matron?

02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:39.880
Sounds like she'll keep us
from misbehaving.

02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:43.040
- I certainly hope so, sir.
- Good.

02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.160
Good, Stevens. Very good.

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:48.680
This is where we had that banquet
back in '35. Remember?

02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:52.640
We all stood up and delivered
ourselves of our principles.

02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:56.680
God knows what I said.
Sure got worked up about it, though.

02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:00.320
What did I say, anyway?

02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:03.040
I'm sorry, sir,
I was too busy serving...

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:06.760
...to listen to the speeches.

02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:13.760
We got a visitor here.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.360
Be very careful.

02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:19.160
Come here.
That's a boy. Come on.

02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:22.440
Okay. Easy does it.

02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:26.320
Come on!

02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.960
You don't want to startle it.

02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:32.840
It'll come down.

02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:39.120
I think if we
leave the window open...

02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:44.880
Good.

02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:46.160
Very still.

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:49.640
Go on. Out!
Come on. Out!

02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:52.640
Well done.

02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:57.720
Well done, sir.
