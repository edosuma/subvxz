00:59.813 --> 01:04.962
No matter which way I figure it,
naught and naught still equals naught.

01:08.606 --> 01:12.217
How about we get Bess in foal?
Pick up some more brood mares?

01:12.317 --> 01:13.761
What with?

01:13.861 --> 01:15.846
If we're going to keep this place,

01:15.946 --> 01:19.514
we're going to have to get a job,
out of the High Country.

01:19.614 --> 01:21.139
- Down on the flats?
- Yeah.

01:21.239 --> 01:24.853
Wouldn't be too bad,
we could hire out as a team.

01:24.953 --> 01:28.626
- Not as cooks.
- Watch it.

01:28.662 --> 01:34.214
Must be your music.

01:35.173 --> 01:36.821
Alright, I'll see to it.

01:49.728 --> 01:54.021
Hey, Bessie...

01:57.479 --> 01:59.985
Bessie.

02:03.149 --> 02:05.149
Bess, whoa.

02:16.874 --> 02:20.084
Steady, girl.

02:20.293 --> 02:23.795
Bessy! Steady, girl.

02:23.831 --> 02:25.338
There, girl.

02:25.375 --> 02:27.592
I reckon the dingo set her off.

02:27.629 --> 02:30.343
Not wild dogs...

02:32.464 --> 02:34.720
wild horses.

02:34.756 --> 02:36.264
The old thoroughbred's mob.

02:36.300 --> 02:39.893
It's years since
he's been this side of the ranges.

02:43.762 --> 02:47.397
You're not going to shoot him?!
He's only going to cause us grief.

02:47.434 --> 02:48.772
Run off our horses.
He's done it before.

02:48.809 --> 02:52.404
But Dad.
There are some good horses there now.

02:52.440 --> 02:56.446
They'd be worth a far bit.

02:56.482 --> 02:57.615
Caught and broken, they might.

02:57.651 --> 03:00.200
Well... we could do it.

03:00.236 --> 03:04.036
Keep some for breeding, then we
wouldn't have to go and hire out.

03:04.074 --> 03:07.956
Hold on. That horse has been running
free since the day you were born.

03:07.992 --> 03:13.712
Craftiest animal I've ever seen. Who better
than a crafty mountain man to catch him.

03:13.747 --> 03:17.089
You've got your mother's way
about you, haven't you?

03:17.126 --> 03:21.052
We could build a holding hard,
up on the flats spur and drive them in.

03:21.088 --> 03:22.677
No, I don't think so.

03:22.713 --> 03:24.804
We'll yard them on Kelly's Track.

05:42.784 --> 05:46.498
Come on! Get up!

05:48.619 --> 05:51.918
Come on.

05:51.954 --> 05:54.838
There. Good boy.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.381
Come on. Get up!

05:59.633 --> 06:01.177
Good boy.

06:01.214 --> 06:04.596
Looks like we're building a fort,
not a holding yard.

06:04.632 --> 06:07.764
When we drop this across the track,
they'll never get out.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.441
Bess!

06:21.478 --> 06:22.984
Jim, the gelding!

06:26.316 --> 06:27.864
Dad!

06:38.621 --> 06:41.916
Are you OK?

06:41.952 --> 06:43.918
I should've put a bullet in that stallion.

06:43.955 --> 06:51.955
I'll get you down to Spurs' place.

06:59.637 --> 07:01.237
Here...

07:06.387 --> 07:11.064
The gelding's broken his leg.
We'll have to put him down.

07:12.939 --> 07:15.776
Where's Bess?
She ran off with the brumbies.

07:15.812 --> 07:19.404
Oh, Spur's not going to be
too happy about that.

07:27.662 --> 07:29.745
We had a lot of dreams.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.041
A lot of good times, too.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.937
NOOO!

08:45.973 --> 08:48.474
"United in death, " the minister said."

08:48.511 --> 08:50.015
Superstition.

08:50.052 --> 08:51.603
It's a nice thought, Spur.

08:51.640 --> 08:56.316
It's a great comfort to widows and fools.
There's more to life than death, Jim.

09:16.082 --> 09:18.125
Well, that's it, lad.

09:18.161 --> 09:20.711
You can't stay up here.

09:22.087 --> 09:25.089
But... this is my place now.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.677
I own it!

09:31.713 --> 09:33.972
Owning it's got nothing to do with it.

09:34.009 --> 09:35.889
It's who can make a go of it up here
that counts.

09:35.925 --> 09:41.101
- I can look after myself!
- Maybe.

09:41.137 --> 09:45.273
What gives you the right to say...
LOOK!

09:45.310 --> 09:50.775
You go down to the low country
and earn the right to live up here,

09:50.812 --> 09:52.525
just like your father did.

09:57.239 --> 09:58.740
Come.

10:09.666 --> 10:11.333
They blame me for this.

10:11.370 --> 10:15.503
It's a hard country.
It makes for hard men.

10:38.229 --> 10:40.940
Come on.

10:43.024 --> 10:44.692
I'll get the fire going.

10:49.531 --> 10:52.197
Spur's wallaby stew!

10:52.234 --> 10:56.662
Mmm. Spoken of
in hushed and reverent tones.

10:58.366 --> 11:02.749
Dad was talking the other day of you
taking the harmonium up the mountain.

11:02.786 --> 11:04.625
Your mother's music box.

11:04.662 --> 11:07.169
Your father and me
brought that up the mountain

11:07.206 --> 11:08.879
with never a scratch on it.

11:08.916 --> 11:11.005
She gave me this seat. Mmm.

11:11.042 --> 11:15.385
Whoo! Figured I could use it more.

11:15.422 --> 11:17.553
Mmm. How's that mare Bess?

11:17.589 --> 11:23.307
See ran off with a brumby...
the old thoroughbreds mob.

11:23.343 --> 11:25.932
The big black.

11:25.970 --> 11:27.895
Yeah.

11:28.977 --> 11:30.520
I remember that animal.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.064
- I'll get her back.
- Sure.

11:32.099 --> 11:33.605
You'll walk in

11:33.641 --> 11:36.691
and pluck her out of a thousand
square miles of wilderness.

11:36.728 --> 11:38.235
- I will, Spur.
- Sure.

11:38.272 --> 11:40.778
I'll run down that mob
and fetch her back.

11:40.815 --> 11:42.279
Sure, and on foot too!

11:48.159 --> 11:49.661
Come on!

11:54.247 --> 11:56.374
I've no notion of his breeding,

11:56.411 --> 11:59.335
but he's a mountain horse...
and a good one.

11:59.710 --> 12:02.714
He's yours!

12:02.750 --> 12:06.799
I can't pay you for him!
He's not for sale.

12:06.835 --> 12:08.466
Now, hold on, Spur...
Don't argue.

12:08.502 --> 12:11.636
A man without a horse,
is like a man without a leg.

12:23.639 --> 12:25.522
Thank you, Spur.

12:25.559 --> 12:27.566
Now I'll get the mare back.

12:27.602 --> 12:31.360
Forget the mare, you duffer.
Don't throw effort after foolishness.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.877
For you, sir,
I could get down to two guineas.

12:51.914 --> 12:54.461
Good luck with the colt.
Very kind of you.

12:54.498 --> 12:55.962
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

12:55.999 --> 13:01.217
Tell you what... two pounds!
I've got other things on my mind today.

13:01.254 --> 13:02.800
Damn Yankee.

13:02.837 --> 13:06.471
Who is that?
Harrison. Picking up his colt.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.514
They say it's worth £1,000.

13:10.552 --> 13:12.851
A colt worth £1,000?

13:31.033 --> 13:33.661
Mr Paterson!

13:33.697 --> 13:36.664
Listen, I'm sorry
about this blasted circus.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.289
Oh, anything to get me away
from the city...

13:39.325 --> 13:42.669
especially when it's to bring you
the finest colt in the colony.

13:42.705 --> 13:47.421
Well, he should be, for the price.

13:47.458 --> 13:50.798
Old Regret. The last colt she foaled.

13:50.834 --> 13:53.841
Irreplaceable.

14:16.692 --> 14:18.235
Let go, mate.

14:18.272 --> 14:19.821
Let bloody go!

14:20.906 --> 14:23.657
Whoa, now.

14:23.693 --> 14:25.533
Are you alright, Jessica?

14:27.452 --> 14:31.162
If I needed your help, 'MATE',
I would've asked for it.

14:36.167 --> 14:39.920
Come on, easy now.

14:52.137 --> 14:53.638
You're it!

14:55.389 --> 14:58.851
Well, I think we're all indebted
to young Mr...

14:58.889 --> 15:00.644
Craig. Jim Craig.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.270
Andrew Paterson.

15:02.307 --> 15:05.104
And that was Mr Harrison
and his charming daughter, Jessica.

15:05.142 --> 15:06.773
- 'Charming'.
- All aboard!

15:06.811 --> 15:08.318
Are you a stock agent?

15:08.353 --> 15:11.195
No, as a matter of fact,
I'm a lawyer. You?

15:11.232 --> 15:12.946
I've just arrived in town.

15:12.983 --> 15:14.489
Well, thanks again, Jim.

15:14.526 --> 15:17.408
If ever we can return the favour,
let us know.

15:17.445 --> 15:18.951
I'm looking for work, sir.

15:18.987 --> 15:21.579
These are hard times, Jim.

15:21.616 --> 15:24.747
I know that,
but I've got a place to keep up.

15:24.784 --> 15:25.791
Mmm.

15:25.827 --> 15:28.334
I've lived on the land.
I can do anything.

15:28.370 --> 15:31.334
- And I've got a good stock horse.
- Have you?

15:31.371 --> 15:34.463
In that case,
we'd better try and find you work, then.

15:34.499 --> 15:36.006
I'll give you a letter.

15:36.042 --> 15:38.383
I know it's sitting
under your skirt somewhere.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.929
You damned old trollop.

15:43.965 --> 15:48.641
20 years you seduce a man
with a speck of gold dust.

15:48.678 --> 15:52.685
Then you tempt him
with a trace of colour.

15:52.722 --> 15:54.645
Nothing but a harlot.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.358
Just like a woman...

16:01.396 --> 16:04.320
has to have the last word.

16:23.287 --> 16:24.795
How'd you find this place?

16:24.832 --> 16:27.713
I tracked you.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.382
You silly old galah.

16:29.419 --> 16:32.426
You leave a trail
like a one-legged seed drill.

16:32.463 --> 16:35.677
Damn you, Clancy.
Always sneaking around.

16:35.714 --> 16:37.429
No noise.

16:37.466 --> 16:39.221
I heard noise.

16:39.258 --> 16:40.932
I heard voices.

16:40.969 --> 16:45.185
Sure sign of old age
when you start hearing things.

16:46.931 --> 16:50.024
You and your partner
still searching for El Dorado, then?

16:51.690 --> 16:53.317
Silent partner now.

16:54.860 --> 16:56.487
Henry Craig's dead.

16:58.027 --> 17:00.028
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

17:00.065 --> 17:02.826
Yeah, just when
good colour was showing too.

17:02.863 --> 17:05.659
You've been saying that
for near 20 years.

17:07.453 --> 17:12.248
You know, the only way to shut that
mouth is with some food. Come on.

17:12.285 --> 17:15.378
You've been offering me food
for 20 years too.

17:15.414 --> 17:17.294
All I ever get's wallaby stew.

17:17.330 --> 17:19.795
Bandicoot...

17:43.190 --> 17:46.067
- Mountain boy.
- That's right, sir.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.026
Curly!

17:50.062 --> 17:51.529
Cut the heifer out.

17:53.699 --> 17:56.074
I'll give you a try.

17:56.111 --> 17:59.243
Usual wages and keep.
Make yourself known to the foreman.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.078
Thank you, sir.

18:09.208 --> 18:12.878
Tasty, huh?

18:14.422 --> 18:17.173
In a toxic, festering sort of way.

18:17.210 --> 18:20.259
You should advertise this stuff
in the 'Bulletin'.

18:21.968 --> 18:24.055
""The new miracle cure for appetite."

18:24.092 --> 18:28.014
To think I was going to leave you
a share of the mine.

18:28.051 --> 18:30.811
Thanks, mate, but I have
my own rainbows to chase.

18:30.848 --> 18:34.187
Yeah, Clancy's vision splendid.

18:34.224 --> 18:37.900
You still obsessed
with those sunlit plains?

18:37.937 --> 18:40.985
At least I get to see the sun
and the stars.

18:41.021 --> 18:43.528
It's better than blundering around
in a black hole,

18:43.565 --> 18:45.199
looking for something that isn't there.

18:45.235 --> 18:48.032
Isn't there?! Now, you wait right here.

18:48.070 --> 18:51.076
"I'll show you.
"Blundering around" in the dark, am I?

18:54.453 --> 18:58.372
Well, wait till you see this.

18:58.409 --> 19:00.332
Come here!

19:00.369 --> 19:01.875
Take a look at this.

19:06.004 --> 19:09.214
Now, that's the kind of colour
I've been getting lately.

19:12.549 --> 19:15.009
It's not much to show for 20 years.

19:15.045 --> 19:16.804
You must've dug a trench from
California to southern Australia.

19:16.841 --> 19:21.141
Thats much better then anything
I saw there in 49.

19:21.178 --> 19:23.976
Now, I put a drive straight through
for 30 chains.

19:24.012 --> 19:28.147
I go down, sink a shaft and we're
smack on top of the richest vein.

19:28.183 --> 19:29.689
Who's 'we', Spur?

19:29.726 --> 19:31.651
Henry Craig's boy.
You remember young Jim.

19:31.688 --> 19:36.403
The lad doesn't know it yet,
but he inherits his father's share,

19:36.439 --> 19:37.906
no matter what it is.

19:43.032 --> 19:46.702
Craig! When you're finished here,
you can muck out the stables.

19:46.739 --> 19:48.207
Yes, sir.

19:52.251 --> 19:55.210
Here. He's a hard worker that lad.

19:55.246 --> 20:00.757
Yeh, seems willing enough. I can't
understand why the boss took him on.

20:00.794 --> 20:02.925
He comes from the mountains.

20:02.961 --> 20:04.843
That was a long time ago.

20:05.926 --> 20:07.592
Morning, Mrs Bailey.

20:19.190 --> 20:21.022
Oh, g'day. I'm Jim Craig.

20:21.058 --> 20:22.190
Pretty good at shoveling that, arn't yeh.

20:22.227 --> 20:23.857
Pretty smart for a mountain fella.

20:23.894 --> 20:29.695
- Uses the flat end and everything.
- Yeh

20:29.733 --> 20:31.322
Live like bandicoots up in the hills.

20:31.358 --> 20:34.161
You digging for grubs there bandicoot.

20:34.197 --> 20:40.080
Have they given you the day off?

20:40.116 --> 20:42.331
I'm studying to be supervisor.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.503
Studying to be stupid!

20:51.714 --> 20:53.048
You.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.216
- Morning, Miss Jessica.
- Morning.

20:55.252 --> 20:58.094
I'll get Kip out for you?
No, thank you.

20:58.130 --> 21:02.138
Well I'll be about my duty miss.

21:02.174 --> 21:03.348
Getting the hang of it, son?

21:03.384 --> 21:07.308
Keep it up,
I'll be back latter to check on your work.

21:12.648 --> 21:18.442
- Kip, what have you been up to... Eh?
- Eh?

21:32.203 --> 21:35.455
Can I help?
No. No, I can manage.

22:02.310 --> 22:04.188
Show me how you did that.

22:04.224 --> 22:05.688
Easy.

22:08.523 --> 22:09.732
So.

22:09.769 --> 22:12.816
In through the loops.

22:14.732 --> 22:17.822
- There's a trick to that one!
- There's no trick at all.

22:17.859 --> 22:19.489
Let me have a go.

22:19.527 --> 22:21.618
- Now... like that?
- This hand up.

22:22.658 --> 22:24.911
- Aha.
- Turn it in.

22:24.948 --> 22:26.161
That's right.

22:26.199 --> 22:27.707
- Pull through?
- You've got it.

22:27.743 --> 22:30.791
This one goes through there.
The ends go through the loops.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.042
- Pull.
- Pull!

22:32.078 --> 22:35.170
Wrong.

22:35.207 --> 22:36.962
- What happened?
- I don't know.

22:43.171 --> 22:44.677
Craig.

22:49.305 --> 22:52.183
Cool off the horse and stable him.
Yes, sir.

22:58.065 --> 23:00.359
Jessica.

23:10.158 --> 23:13.576
It's called the 'tomfools' knot'.
You're getting the hang of it.

23:13.612 --> 23:15.661
I'll be back latter to check on your work.

23:20.872 --> 23:22.457
Why aren't you at your lessons?

23:22.493 --> 23:24.792
One of the brood mares is foaling,
she'll need a had.

23:24.828 --> 23:27.045
You're not midwife
to a herd of horses.

23:27.081 --> 23:29.838
The men can handle that.
I can do it better.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.547
It's not an occupation for a lady.
"A lady"!

23:32.584 --> 23:34.716
Yes, 'lady'.
The word become old-fashioned?

23:34.753 --> 23:37.260
It's become an excuse
to keep women under control!

23:37.297 --> 23:39.595
Please spare me
your aunt's feminist rubbish.

23:39.630 --> 23:42.224
You should be thinking
of marriage, children.

23:42.261 --> 23:43.767
The well-known cattle breeder

23:43.803 --> 23:46.268
has a breeding program
for his daughter as well.

23:46.304 --> 23:47.812
You keep a civil tongue.

23:47.849 --> 23:50.480
I don't understand
where this rudeness comes from.

23:54.151 --> 23:56.152
Which bed's mine?

23:56.189 --> 23:58.613
Any one that doesn't buck you off, boy.

24:00.192 --> 24:02.990
That one's empty, son.
It's yours if you want it.

24:05.199 --> 24:07.704
You can keep your saddle
in the tack room.

24:07.741 --> 24:09.662
Yeah, stop there yourself
if you like.

24:09.699 --> 24:12.373
Grow up, Curly.
Drop dead, you old fart.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.583
Watch your tongue, boy...
whlle you've still got one.

24:15.619 --> 24:18.168
Deal the cards, boss.

24:20.005 --> 24:21.712
Two.

24:21.749 --> 24:25.215
They're starting the High Country
muster in a couple of days.

24:25.251 --> 24:27.633
Gonna be an early winter,
according to Kane.

24:27.670 --> 24:28.677
Yep.

24:28.714 --> 24:31.179
I thought Harrison
controlled the seasons.

24:31.216 --> 24:34.599
I reckon the boss will hold
the muster till Clancy gets here.

24:34.634 --> 24:38.392
Well, who's he, then? Some kind
of top rider, this Clancy bloke?

24:38.428 --> 24:41.647
No, he's no rider. He's a horseman.

24:42.395 --> 24:47.276
Yeh Curly, look at this.

24:47.312 --> 24:49.818
Well, what's so special
about Clancy, then?

24:49.855 --> 24:52.279
I told you, he's a horseman.

24:52.314 --> 24:56.573
'Horseman'?
Clancy's not just a horseman.

24:56.610 --> 25:00.370
Clancy's a... a magician.
He's a genius.

25:01.744 --> 25:03.411
I've met him.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.248
When I was young.

25:08.286 --> 25:10.169
He and my father were mates.

25:10.205 --> 25:12.753
Mates? Bullshit!

25:12.790 --> 25:14.628
Mates! Mates.

25:14.665 --> 25:17.338
Wouldn't have a bloody mate
to save his life.

25:19.006 --> 25:24.218
Oh, sorry, Your Honour. Mates!
Sorry, beg your pardon, Your Honour.

25:24.255 --> 25:27.139
Mates with Clancy, eh?

25:55.535 --> 25:58.746
What's going on?
Some kind of union meeting?

25:59.831 --> 26:01.373
They've heard that Clancy's coming.

26:01.410 --> 26:04.377
They've all come out
to gawk at him?

26:04.414 --> 26:07.754
It's not often they get a chance
to meet a legend.

26:35.736 --> 26:37.446
Jim Craig, isn't it?

26:38.530 --> 26:41.321
- Been a long time.
- Yes, sir.

26:41.357 --> 26:43.533
I'll see to your horses?

26:45.701 --> 26:47.910
Watch him, he's a hog for water.

26:49.998 --> 26:51.539
Oh, Jim.

26:51.576 --> 26:54.459
I was very sorry
to hear about your father.

26:56.794 --> 26:58.336
He was a good mate.

26:59.420 --> 27:01.547
- Clancy.
- Kane.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.888
"Go west, young man, " they said.
"Go west!"

27:10.925 --> 27:14.601
So I did - 10,000 miles further
than they intended.

27:14.636 --> 27:17.937
And I found gold.
In beef cattle.

27:17.972 --> 27:20.646
We made more money selling
meat to the miners

27:20.682 --> 27:23.814
than they ever dug up
in their claims, didn't we, Clancy?

27:23.850 --> 27:26.108
Well, you sold them.
I only drove them.

27:26.144 --> 27:29.236
He was known around the diggings
as 'The California Horse-Trader'.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.613
This is the finest trifle
I've ever eaten, Mrs Hume.

27:33.649 --> 27:35.365
It's more than a trifle, Clancy.

27:35.402 --> 27:37.034
It's a charlotte russe.
Charlotte russe!

27:37.071 --> 27:40.371
My dear sister-in-law occasionally
bestows on us simple bush people

27:40.408 --> 27:41.913
the fruits of her learning.

27:41.949 --> 27:45.248
Just as well, or Jessica would've
been brought up with the kangaroos

27:45.284 --> 27:47.541
and we'd be dining in a bark hut.

27:47.576 --> 27:49.584
Rosemary, you never appreciate
the sacrifices made

27:49.621 --> 27:51.375
in building a property like this.

27:51.412 --> 27:53.338
Would you pass the decanter, please?

27:54.916 --> 27:56.422
Mr Paterson?

27:56.458 --> 27:59.384
I'm sorry. I didn't realise.

27:59.420 --> 28:02.760
That women may also enjoy what
custom deems is a man's privilege?

28:02.797 --> 28:05.014
None of your speeches.
Aunt Rosemary's quite right.

28:05.050 --> 28:08.142
Women SHOULD have the right
to do anything they're capable of.

28:08.178 --> 28:10.436
You hear that?
The notion's like a germ.

28:10.471 --> 28:12.394
My own daughter
infected with your nonsense.

28:12.431 --> 28:15.186
Your own daughter,
as you know, has a good mind,

28:15.223 --> 28:17.734
a way with horses
and an eye for stockbreeding.

28:17.770 --> 28:21.193
Now would you have these developed, or
would you condemn her to domestic dullness

28:21.229 --> 28:23.987
You should be in a ladys' college,
and not in the stabbles.

28:24.024 --> 28:26.529
Well, whatever the complexities
of the argument, Mrs Hume,

28:26.565 --> 28:28.864
you're certainly proof
the legal profession's been denied

28:28.901 --> 28:30.658
the services of a great advocate.

28:30.695 --> 28:33.160
Women lawyers?
That'll be the day.

28:33.196 --> 28:35.952
That such sweet libation
should have fathered su...

28:35.989 --> 28:38.079
I am sorry, madam.

28:38.116 --> 28:40.833
MOTHERED such a disputation.

28:40.870 --> 28:43.377
Rosemary,
if you're finished with the port...

28:43.412 --> 28:44.919
Quite.

28:44.956 --> 28:48.588
It's a far cry from
the dark rum we drank on the track.

28:48.624 --> 28:51.925
Yes. Here's to those
long-gone days on the trail.

28:51.961 --> 28:55.347
Well, for ME, they're not long gone.
So here's to their future.

28:55.385 --> 28:57.138
Oh, there's no future there, Clancy.

28:57.175 --> 29:00.600
I wouldn't swap the sunlit plains
for all the tea in China.

29:00.637 --> 29:03.060
They are a vision splendoured.

29:03.097 --> 29:06.229
Clancy, how romantic.
Romantic?! Your brain's gone soft!

29:06.266 --> 29:08.314
We've got
the railways and roads now.

29:08.351 --> 29:10.524
Mr Paterson,
we can ship refrigerated beef

29:10.561 --> 29:12.360
to the markets of England, Europe.

29:12.396 --> 29:13.902
THAT'S where the future lies.

29:13.939 --> 29:16.445
You were ALWAYS a way ahead
of the old squatters.

29:16.481 --> 29:18.403
Which is why there's few of them left.

29:18.439 --> 29:20.491
They tore the guts out of the country.
THEY did?!

29:20.527 --> 29:24.700
I see the day when we'll be one of
the greatest food producers of the world.

29:24.737 --> 29:28.035
And YOU have it all under control!
Yes, except for those mountains.

29:28.072 --> 29:30.286
With the cattle,
I'd run freighters up there...

29:30.323 --> 29:32.541
PRAISED be the lack of capitalism!

29:32.577 --> 29:34.083
Ladies and gentlemen...

29:34.120 --> 29:36.042
May I propose a toast?

29:36.079 --> 29:37.626
Yes.

29:37.663 --> 29:39.710
To our two romantics.

29:39.747 --> 29:43.508
To one who sees what is
and one who sees what can be.

29:43.544 --> 29:45.634
Lord grant that the two are compatible.

29:53.890 --> 29:56.769
Mrs Bailey said to bring
some more firewood.

29:56.805 --> 29:58.604
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Jim.

29:58.641 --> 30:00.146
Good evening, Jim.

30:00.183 --> 30:03.691
Well, we all seem to be introduced.
Not all of us, Harrison.

30:03.728 --> 30:05.651
I'm Mrs Hume.

30:05.687 --> 30:07.360
How do you do, ma'am?

30:09.029 --> 30:13.283
Jim, Mr Harrison was just talking
of taming the Snowy River country.

30:13.319 --> 30:16.202
You know it better than us -
what do you think?

30:17.869 --> 30:19.370
Well, sir...

30:20.452 --> 30:24.166
I think you might sooner hold back
the tide than tame the mountains.

30:26.709 --> 30:28.209
Excuse me, then.

30:30.669 --> 30:33.756
That boy has a quality about him.

30:33.793 --> 30:36.383
Yeah. The mongrel quality
of the mountain people.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.093
Does that include your brother?

30:40.761 --> 30:42.262
I have no brother.

30:47.518 --> 30:53.186
We have a early start in the morning
Good Night!

30:53.223 --> 30:55.062
"And Laban said unto him,

30:55.099 --> 30:59.901
"'I pray thee, if I have found
favour in thine eyes, tarry,

30:59.938 --> 31:02.069
"'for I have learned by experience

31:02.106 --> 31:05.571
"'that the Lord hath blessed me
for thy sake.'

31:05.608 --> 31:07.740
""And he said..."

31:07.777 --> 31:12.369
Here - last time I saw a saddle like that,
it was at the circus, you know?

31:12.405 --> 31:14.663
Had a monkey riding on it!

31:14.699 --> 31:16.455
Where's your rope, Curly? Give up?

31:16.491 --> 31:19.583
"'..And how thy cattle was with me."'

31:19.619 --> 31:21.125
Lads.

31:21.162 --> 31:23.752
I want everyone saddled and packed
by sunrise.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.755
We'll eat at the Perry homestead.

31:26.792 --> 31:30.090
The only time
the boss eats his own beef.

31:30.127 --> 31:33.387
- And he don't know it.
- Yeah!

31:33.421 --> 31:36.223
Anything special we've got to take?

31:39.976 --> 31:41.808
There's been a change of plans.

31:41.846 --> 31:44.310
You won't be going on this muster, Jim.

31:44.347 --> 31:45.854
W...?

31:45.891 --> 31:48.357
They've probably seen
that half-pie mule of yours!

31:48.392 --> 31:51.442
He's a mountain horse.
He knows that country better than I.

31:51.479 --> 31:56.988
I don't make the orders.
But when I give them, that's the end of it.

32:01.654 --> 32:05.328
Anyone not ready to go by dawn
gets their tail ends kicked!

32:05.365 --> 32:07.790
"'..Spotted cattle,
and all the brown cattle among..."'

32:07.826 --> 32:09.457
You too short man.

32:09.493 --> 32:10.958
Amen.

32:12.292 --> 32:13.918
""And there were spot..."

32:18.210 --> 32:19.673
Mr Kane?

32:21.342 --> 32:23.884
Why? Why me?

32:31.432 --> 32:32.933
I think I know.

32:34.393 --> 32:36.061
You'll get your chance, Jim.

32:50.321 --> 32:52.158
Don't forget to feed the chooks bandicoot.

32:52.194 --> 32:53.700
Pshht!

33:54.415 --> 33:56.499
Really, Jessica.

33:56.536 --> 34:00.127
You're attacking that piece with all
the sensitivity of a road-mender.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.047
Now, let's begin again, shall we?

34:02.084 --> 34:05.255
And this time, 'con amore'.

34:05.292 --> 34:07.469
And spare me
the affectations of martyrdom.

34:07.506 --> 34:09.429
Come.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.808
- Hello, Jim.
- Ma'am.

34:13.844 --> 34:17.806
Mrs Bailey said I should
bring this up. To save her legs.

34:17.844 --> 34:20.188
Your timing is Jessica's salvation.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.895
Hello.

34:21.931 --> 34:23.440
Whoops.

34:23.476 --> 34:25.940
Will you join us for tea?

34:25.976 --> 34:29.485
No. I can't, Mrs Hume.
Oh, nonsense.

34:29.521 --> 34:33.614
Male company will be a pleasant relief
in this hothouse of female emotions.

34:33.650 --> 34:36.447
Er, Jessica, pour the tea.
I'll get another cup.

34:40.534 --> 34:43.371
Do you mind?
Well, no. Why should I?

34:47.248 --> 34:51.293
Well... we're both feeling
sorry for ourselves today.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.339
Neither is where we want to be.

34:55.375 --> 34:56.882
Yeah.

34:56.918 --> 35:00.092
I think they're trying to make
a butler out of me.

35:00.128 --> 35:03.303
Well, they're trying
to make a lady out of me.

35:03.340 --> 35:05.930
They won't have no luck.
Thank you very much!

35:05.967 --> 35:07.681
Hang on. That's not what I...

35:07.717 --> 35:10.186
They won't make a gentleman
out of you either.

35:17.355 --> 35:18.856
Do you play?

35:20.272 --> 35:22.401
Yes. Just a bit.

35:23.569 --> 35:26.989
Before my mum died,
she was starting to teach me.

35:31.949 --> 35:33.450
Do you miss her?

35:35.620 --> 35:37.122
Yeah.

35:38.205 --> 35:39.705
Yeah, I miss her.

35:41.249 --> 35:42.918
I never knew my mother.

35:44.501 --> 35:46.045
I'm sorry.

35:46.081 --> 35:48.505
I bet she was pretty.

35:49.590 --> 35:51.132
Like you.

35:51.168 --> 35:54.009
Mmm, thank you, kind sir.

36:01.516 --> 36:03.266
Thanks for the tea...

36:03.303 --> 36:04.934
Jessica.

36:06.059 --> 36:08.771
I've got a few jobs to finish
before dinnertime.

36:45.842 --> 36:47.341
There's a man.

36:49.971 --> 36:51.471
Yeah.

36:52.556 --> 36:54.097
He's a pretty thing.

36:54.134 --> 36:57.016
There's not a mean bone in his body.

36:57.053 --> 37:01.478
Curly will find one.
He does all the breaking around here.

37:01.515 --> 37:02.982
Curly?!

37:04.064 --> 37:06.732
You've got to be firm
with a young horse.

37:06.768 --> 37:10.027
But not cruel. You work
with a horse, not against him.

37:10.064 --> 37:13.738
Really?
That's what my father taught me.

37:13.774 --> 37:16.991
This is not just a mountain brumby.

37:19.994 --> 37:21.705
It's no different.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.955
Are you saying
you could break this horse?

37:25.039 --> 37:26.582
Yes.

37:28.210 --> 37:30.379
Well...

37:32.923 --> 37:34.591
What about your father?

37:34.627 --> 37:37.215
He'll be away for more than a week.

37:37.252 --> 37:41.221
If the job's done before he gets back,
what can he say?

41:42.073 --> 41:45.204
Whoa, boy! Hey.

41:50.999 --> 41:54.211
Whoa, boy! Whoa.

41:57.795 --> 41:59.296
Bess!

42:04.427 --> 42:06.010
Jim? Don't you dare!

42:28.071 --> 42:30.030
JIM!

43:11.645 --> 43:13.228
How's the head?

43:18.067 --> 43:20.568
Mrs Bailey told me this is your favourite.

43:21.693 --> 43:23.028
What happened to the colt?

43:23.065 --> 43:25.198
- We yarded him.
- Is he alright?

43:25.234 --> 43:28.574
Oh, he's still a bit flighty,
but not hurt - luckily.

43:28.611 --> 43:31.746
There'll be hell to pay
when your father finds out.

43:31.781 --> 43:35.248
Well, he won't find out.
We've all agreed not to tell him.

43:35.285 --> 43:36.957
'We'? Who's 'we'?

43:36.993 --> 43:39.041
Mrs Bailey, Aunt Rosemary and I.

43:39.078 --> 43:42.254
I'm not hiding behind the skirts
of a bunch of women!

43:42.292 --> 43:43.921
Oh, I'm so sorry!

43:43.959 --> 43:47.135
I must remember that
next time you try to kill yourself.

43:47.170 --> 43:48.677
That's nonsense, Jessica.

43:48.713 --> 43:51.470
Well, somebody's got to save you
from your own thoughtlessness!

43:51.507 --> 43:54.640
Don't you Harrisons get tierd of
running other peoples lives.

43:54.675 --> 43:56.807
- You ungrateful...!
- Because I'm getting tired of it.

43:56.844 --> 44:00.351
Well don't worry, thats the last time
I'll stand up for the likes of you.

44:00.388 --> 44:01.895
Jessica!

44:01.931 --> 44:04.771
You are a foolish boy, Jim.

44:39.218 --> 44:40.759
How many missing?

44:40.795 --> 44:42.717
20, at the last count.

44:42.754 --> 44:44.887
Take your horse for you,
Mr Harrison?

44:44.924 --> 44:46.429
Hey, where's the mountain boy?

44:46.466 --> 44:48.183
Still in his bunk.

44:54.228 --> 44:55.728
Craig?

44:57.564 --> 45:00.316
You waiting for breakfast in bed?

45:00.352 --> 45:01.398
What happened?

45:01.435 --> 45:03.651
I came off the...

45:03.687 --> 45:05.278
off a horse.

45:05.315 --> 45:10.533
You think you could get back on?
Pick up 20 strays we left up on top?

45:10.570 --> 45:12.076
Yes, sir.

45:12.113 --> 45:15.870
Before those mountain men
get their grubby hands on them.

45:46.727 --> 45:48.685
It's good to be back.

45:48.722 --> 45:50.732
At least nothing changes up here.

45:50.768 --> 45:54.109
I saw Bess again with the brumbies.
Nearly got her back.

45:54.146 --> 45:57.486
I told you not to throw effort
after foolishness. Forget it.

45:58.987 --> 46:01.283
How are things going on down there?

46:01.319 --> 46:02.824
Not good.

46:04.158 --> 46:06.494
I'm working for a fellow called Harrison.

46:08.119 --> 46:10.537
He reminds me of someone.

46:10.574 --> 46:12.708
You never told me you had a brother.

46:12.744 --> 46:14.916
You never asked.
Well, I'm asking now.

46:14.953 --> 46:17.334
You just concern yourself with Jim Craig.

46:23.922 --> 46:25.925
Have you seen Jessica?

46:25.962 --> 46:27.927
Yeah.

46:27.963 --> 46:29.469
What's she like?

46:29.506 --> 46:31.597
She's a Harrison.

46:33.176 --> 46:36.766
I'm getting out after this muster.

46:36.803 --> 46:39.144
Henry Craigs' son quitting?

46:39.181 --> 46:41.896
Are you saying I should stick it out?

46:41.933 --> 46:44.856
You can learn more from Harrison
than you know.

46:46.524 --> 46:48.859
I'll be searching for his strays for weeks.

46:48.895 --> 46:50.862
Not if you know where to look.

46:50.898 --> 46:51.402
At the first hint of snow,

46:51.439 --> 46:55.366
every beast on this plato
heds for the bluff.

46:55.403 --> 47:00.326
Warm pocket, good forage.
Gather them up with a butterfly net.

47:00.363 --> 47:01.995
How do you know?

47:02.032 --> 47:05.290
Well, I don't always eat wallaby, son!

47:09.917 --> 47:11.294
Grubby hands.

47:11.331 --> 47:14.464
Harrison was right.

47:18.632 --> 47:21.635
I'd say prime 2-year-old Hereford.
Mm-hm.

47:21.673 --> 47:23.637
Fattened on mountain pasture.
Mmm!

47:24.721 --> 47:26.806
Might be a good cattleman yet!

47:56.455 --> 47:59.167
You walk this horse to stable.

48:48.245 --> 48:49.996
What happened to the colt?

48:50.033 --> 48:52.247
The wild horses came down,
ran through the place. They set him off.

48:52.284 --> 48:54.458
I'm asking Jessica.

48:56.542 --> 48:58.795
A bruise in the foreleg.

48:58.832 --> 49:01.964
Black soil from the bottom paddock
still on the hoofs.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.590
And a girth mark
around the horse's belly.

49:05.628 --> 49:08.510
You're an intelligent girl, Jessica.

49:08.548 --> 49:10.637
What does that add up to?

49:10.673 --> 49:14.015
Your old friend is still alive.

49:14.051 --> 49:15.514
The stallion.

49:19.144 --> 49:20.853
He was leading the brumbies.

49:25.356 --> 49:28.820
Who rode the colt?

49:28.855 --> 49:30.655
We were breaking him in...
'We'?

49:30.691 --> 49:32.907
Jim's very good with horses.
That mountain boy.

49:32.944 --> 49:34.617
Now, wait. It wasn't his fault.

49:34.652 --> 49:37.159
He was riding it
when the brumbies came down.

49:37.195 --> 49:39.995
He went to save the stock horses.
What stupidity!

49:40.032 --> 49:42.329
To save stock horses
worth a few shillings

49:42.365 --> 49:44.038
and risk a colt worth £1,000?!

49:44.078 --> 49:47.001
You can't blame him for that.
It happened too suddenly.

49:47.038 --> 49:48.544
Well, 'suddenly', he's finished here!

49:48.581 --> 49:51.465
He gets off this place
the moment he gets back.

49:51.501 --> 49:54.257
There's a train tomorrow.
Take Jessica with you.

49:54.292 --> 49:56.676
You will board
at the Presbyterian Ladies' College.

49:56.712 --> 49:58.176
No! I won't go!

50:00.137 --> 50:02.180
You're as deceitful as your mother.

50:16.107 --> 50:19.025
You wouldn't dare break the spirit
of that wretched colt

50:19.061 --> 50:21.527
the way you just crushed
your own daughter.

50:21.564 --> 50:23.405
My daughter?

50:23.440 --> 50:25.154
You really believe that?

50:25.191 --> 50:27.532
Oh, when will you give up
this obsession?!

50:27.568 --> 50:29.283
You tell me. Matilda's your sister.

50:29.319 --> 50:32.161
You see other people so clearly,
but look at yourself

50:32.197 --> 50:36.081
What if the night you fired those shots,
your aim had been better?

50:36.117 --> 50:37.749
What then?

51:01.975 --> 51:04.771
Now all we need's
a butterfly net.

51:23.618 --> 51:25.162
Get uphill.

51:27.199 --> 51:28.871
Get up.

51:30.040 --> 51:31.541
Get uphill.

52:46.935 --> 52:48.437
Oh!

52:49.978 --> 52:51.188
NO!

53:08.702 --> 53:10.578
I don't understand.

53:10.615 --> 53:12.913
She's never done
anything like this before.

53:12.950 --> 53:15.748
They've been drinking
since they got back with the cattle.

53:15.784 --> 53:18.752
Weather turning bad.
We've got to find her quick.

53:18.789 --> 53:21.295
They're not going to be
any use to us.

53:21.331 --> 53:22.837
What?

53:22.873 --> 53:26.047
The men are drunk.
They won't be any use to us.

53:26.084 --> 53:28.842
I want them ready to ride in 10 minutes.

53:28.877 --> 53:30.344
Yes, sir.

53:36.723 --> 53:38.976
Alright, up! I want all men.

53:39.012 --> 53:41.771
Moss, you've got five minutes
to be dressed and outside!

53:41.806 --> 53:43.854
Curly? Curly!

53:43.890 --> 53:46.021
God save us.

53:47.107 --> 53:49.651
Come on, old man. I need you.

53:49.687 --> 53:51.193
It was him or me.

53:51.229 --> 53:53.986
You better be careful
what you say in your sleep.

53:54.022 --> 53:57.656
Jessica's gone and got herself lost.
I need a tracker and you're it.

53:57.692 --> 54:00.784
Can't even see to find my boots.
Well, go without them!

54:00.821 --> 54:02.411
Five minutes!

54:58.289 --> 55:02.543
Boss, the men are exhausted...
and there's a storm coming up.

55:02.579 --> 55:04.502
And my daughter's out there in it.

55:06.127 --> 55:09.880
In a few minutes we're not going
to be able to see anything.

55:09.917 --> 55:12.343
Then stay here and rot.

55:34.151 --> 55:35.694
Kip?

55:35.731 --> 55:37.195
JESSICA?

55:38.405 --> 55:39.905
JESSICA?!

55:41.114 --> 55:42.614
JESSICA?!

55:44.284 --> 55:46.328
Yah!

56:36.407 --> 56:40.243
Boss, there's no hope of finding
any tracks after all that rain.

56:40.280 --> 56:41.869
We've got to keep looking.

56:44.247 --> 56:47.332
Jessica!

56:47.369 --> 56:51.794
Jess!

56:51.830 --> 56:53.379
Jessica!

57:01.886 --> 57:03.389
Jess!

57:08.099 --> 57:09.643
HELP!

57:09.679 --> 57:11.685
HELP ME!

57:13.437 --> 57:15.897
Oh, help.

57:15.934 --> 57:18.816
Jess!

57:39.457 --> 57:43.875
So, that's it, eh?
No more working for the old...

57:43.911 --> 57:45.377
your father.

57:46.461 --> 57:49.048
I never thought
I'd be sorry about that...

57:50.297 --> 57:51.800
but I am.

57:52.885 --> 57:54.386
Why are you sorry?

57:56.054 --> 57:57.555
I'll miss seeing you.

57:59.016 --> 58:02.184
You won't miss seeing me,
'cause I'm not going back.

58:02.219 --> 58:04.603
Come on Jess, you can't...
Listen!

58:04.640 --> 58:08.022
When I was trapped on that cliff,
I was terrified,

58:08.057 --> 58:12.232
but that passed and...
I started to see things very clearly.

58:13.317 --> 58:17.321
All I wanted was to see you again.
To be with you.

58:17.357 --> 58:20.407
Nothing else.

58:21.991 --> 58:24.285
And so I hung on until you came.

58:27.120 --> 58:28.620
Jess, I...

58:43.548 --> 58:45.426
I have to take you back.

58:45.463 --> 58:47.385
But I'm not going back.

58:47.422 --> 58:49.344
They'll be worried sick about you.

58:50.429 --> 58:52.558
I don't care.

58:52.594 --> 58:55.727
There'll be men out looking for you,
risking their lives.

58:56.810 --> 58:59.229
Anyhow, I've got to get the cattle down.

59:00.313 --> 59:02.356
Haven't you been listening to me?

59:02.392 --> 59:03.939
Yeah, it's just that...

59:05.565 --> 59:07.485
I have to finish this job.

59:11.528 --> 59:14.907
I'll take you to Spur's place
and come back for the cattle.

59:19.994 --> 59:22.456
I'm sorry.

59:23.707 --> 59:26.710
It's just that,
everything seemed so clear to me.

59:48.595 --> 59:50.060
I'm sorry.

01:00:06.404 --> 01:00:09.286
It's so peaceful here.

01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:14.705
It's like we're the only
two people on earth.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.744
You ready, then?

01:01:29.643 --> 01:01:31.184
Oh, Jim.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.726
It's...

01:01:32.763 --> 01:01:34.228
It's beautiful.

01:01:35.973 --> 01:01:37.857
But wait till that gets here.

01:01:38.982 --> 01:01:41.108
It changes so suddenly, doesn't it?

01:01:41.144 --> 01:01:44.278
One minute, it's like paradise and...

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.486
the next, it's trying to kill you.

01:01:47.522 --> 01:01:50.033
Yep. That's how it can be up here.

01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:51.532
But...

01:01:53.159 --> 01:01:57.659
if it was easy to get to know it,
there'd be... no challenge.

01:01:59.831 --> 01:02:01.831
You've got to treat the mountains...

01:02:03.083 --> 01:02:05.250
like a high-spirited horse.

01:02:05.286 --> 01:02:07.043
Never take them for granted.

01:02:08.878 --> 01:02:10.923
It's the same with people too.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:03.714
Gone.

01:03:05.258 --> 01:03:06.799
Nothing.

01:03:06.836 --> 01:03:08.466
No colour.

01:03:08.503 --> 01:03:11.260
Jezebel!

01:03:16.139 --> 01:03:17.739
OOOH...

01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:38.823
Holy creature!

01:03:38.859 --> 01:03:42.828
So, that's what you've been trying
to tell me all these years?

01:03:42.864 --> 01:03:45.038
That you're up HERE.

01:04:03.009 --> 01:04:04.510
Spur?

01:04:06.721 --> 01:04:08.222
Spur!

01:04:09.682 --> 01:04:11.223
Damn.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.808
What a strange place!

01:04:12.844 --> 01:04:14.893
Who is this Spur?

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.437
I thought you knew him.

01:04:18.473 --> 01:04:20.275
Why should I?

01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:24.149
You wait here.
I'll check down at the creek.

01:04:34.743 --> 01:04:36.245
Spur?

01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:43.793
Hello?

01:05:03.222 --> 01:05:04.722
He's not down there.

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:28.953
Jim!

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:31.120
Jim Craig!

01:05:31.156 --> 01:05:32.330
Jim, my boy!

01:05:32.366 --> 01:05:35.083
They said old Spur was mad... Ha!

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.625
Man! Ha! YA-HOO!

01:05:36.662 --> 01:05:39.504
Are you alright?
I never felt better in my life!

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:41.004
I...

01:05:51.553 --> 01:05:53.555
Matilda.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.265
I found the gold.

01:05:56.302 --> 01:05:58.725
I'm Jessica.

01:05:58.762 --> 01:06:00.728
Jessica Harrison.

01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:06.774
Oh, Jessica!

01:06:09.104 --> 01:06:10.777
You've grown up.

01:06:10.813 --> 01:06:13.196
Jess, this is Spur.

01:06:13.232 --> 01:06:15.406
And...

01:06:15.442 --> 01:06:18.993
he's your uncle, your father's brother.

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:24.036
One of life's injustices. You never
get to choose your own relatives.

01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:28.707
Uncle?

01:06:28.744 --> 01:06:31.042
Let this be a lesson to you, Jim.

01:06:31.079 --> 01:06:32.586
I find a little gold

01:06:32.623 --> 01:06:36.129
and suddenly, after all these years,
the relatives turn up.

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:39.090
Why do you keep
this portrait of my mother?

01:06:40.671 --> 01:06:45.096
The prettiest visitor I've ever had
and not even a cup of tea! Come on.

01:06:46.221 --> 01:06:50.352
What are you trying to hide from me?
I'm not a child.

01:06:52.477 --> 01:06:54.310
Hey, Jessica...

01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:04.776
when you try to dig up the past.

01:07:04.813 --> 01:07:10.865
Look Spur, Jess has to get home, and
I have to go back for the cattle.

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:12.866
Can you take her down?

01:07:12.902 --> 01:07:15.120
Sure. Sure.

01:07:16.204 --> 01:07:18.332
You look after her for me, then.

01:07:18.369 --> 01:07:19.999
Oh, I'll look after her...

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.877
like you were my own daughter.

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:23.960
I won't be far behind you.

01:07:25.962 --> 01:07:28.132
And don't touch his wallaby stew.

01:07:28.168 --> 01:07:30.341
Why, you ungrateful tyke!

01:07:30.377 --> 01:07:32.260
There'll be no wallaby tonight!

01:07:32.296 --> 01:07:34.594
I'll kill the fatted calf.

01:07:34.632 --> 01:07:38.597
Come to think of it,
I already have.

01:07:39.682 --> 01:07:41.807
Yah!

01:08:19.839 --> 01:08:22.756
It WAS silly, I suppose,
but I was so angry!

01:08:22.792 --> 01:08:25.676
Then I couldn't think
of anything else but seeing Jim.

01:08:25.712 --> 01:08:27.219
No harm done.

01:08:27.254 --> 01:08:31.307
What's the sense of being young
if you can't be impulsive now and then?

01:08:31.343 --> 01:08:33.224
Now, tablecloth.
No expense spared.

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.935
And you can read the news
while you're eating.

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:41.813
They charge you three guineas extra
for the cobwebs down in the city.

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:44.023
- Glasses?
- On the shelf.

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:48.069
Oh. These must be quite valuable.
Matched pair.

01:08:48.104 --> 01:08:49.694
They're both broken.

01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:54.031
Jessica, take this plate,
and follow me to the cool room.

01:08:54.067 --> 01:08:57.952
Now, for the pièce de rèsistance.

01:08:57.988 --> 01:08:59.620
You raise beef!

01:08:59.657 --> 01:09:01.162
Oh, well known for it.

01:09:01.198 --> 01:09:02.705
Small, modest herd

01:09:02.741 --> 01:09:06.709
made up of poor creatures
who've lost their way.

01:09:06.746 --> 01:09:09.877
And 'H' is for...?

01:09:09.913 --> 01:09:11.417
'Homeless'.

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:47.365
Thank god she's safe.
Where is she?

01:09:47.402 --> 01:09:50.198
She's on her way home.

01:10:14.092 --> 01:10:18.095
Why haven't I been told about Spur?

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:22.351
Well, was my mother unfaithful? Or...

01:10:22.387 --> 01:10:24.060
- Nonsense, girl.
- Was she?

01:10:24.096 --> 01:10:27.436
What did Spur tell you?
Nothing.

01:10:29.481 --> 01:10:31.273
Aunt Rosemary, please.

01:10:42.451 --> 01:10:43.993
About 20 years ago,

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:47.581
two brothers fell in love with
the prettiest girl in the district.

01:10:47.617 --> 01:10:51.415
Oh, she was young and life
for Matilda was like childish games.

01:10:51.451 --> 01:10:54.212
Well, both the men
wanted her hand in marriage,

01:10:54.249 --> 01:10:56.086
but she couldn't choose between them.

01:10:56.123 --> 01:11:00.424
So she decided the first one to make
his fortune would be her husband.

01:11:00.461 --> 01:11:02.298
She hadn't the faintest idea

01:11:02.335 --> 01:11:05.300
what chain of events
that would set in motion.

01:11:05.337 --> 01:11:08.760
Well, one of the men scraped
all his savings together

01:11:08.797 --> 01:11:13.432
and gambled in one bold throw -
a horse named Pardon in the Cup.

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:16.057
It won, at 50-to-1 . He was wealthy.

01:11:16.095 --> 01:11:17.601
Father.

01:11:17.638 --> 01:11:19.935
And Spur?

01:11:22.313 --> 01:11:24.023
He went looking for gold.

01:11:32.156 --> 01:11:34.491
My dear Mrs Bailey, tell me,

01:11:34.527 --> 01:11:39.162
by what magic do you transform
this humble farmyard chicken

01:11:39.199 --> 01:11:41.998
into such delicate ambrosia?

01:11:42.035 --> 01:11:43.833
You do go on.

01:11:43.869 --> 01:11:46.376
And you gave me my favourite piece too.

01:11:46.412 --> 01:11:48.918
A plump breast.

01:11:52.172 --> 01:11:55.259
Unless it be... tenderloin.

01:11:55.296 --> 01:11:59.011
Oooh! Mrs Bailey!

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.638
You're a cruel woman!
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:12:01.675 --> 01:12:04.557
Are you alright?
I knew the moment I walked in.

01:12:04.594 --> 01:12:10.644
"I said to myself, "This... is a woman
to satisfy a man's... appetites."

01:12:12.224 --> 01:12:14.315
I didn't expect you for a while.

01:12:14.352 --> 01:12:16.734
So I see.

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:20.402
- How's Jessica?
- She's fine.

01:12:20.438 --> 01:12:23.781
Er... Spur was, er, just helping me
get her supper ready.

01:12:23.818 --> 01:12:25.657
Oh, YOU'RE still here!

01:12:25.694 --> 01:12:28.452
Well, you'd better not be
when your brother gets back.

01:12:28.487 --> 01:12:31.410
Run away? I'm too old
to play the prodigal son.

01:12:31.446 --> 01:12:33.787
Er, thank you, Mrs Bailey.

01:12:33.824 --> 01:12:36.290
And come on, Jim.
After I see Jess.

01:12:36.327 --> 01:12:38.667
Hey, I think we'd better be going.

01:12:39.752 --> 01:12:43.296
We'll let the weather clear a bit.
I want to see her.

01:12:55.766 --> 01:12:57.265
Hey!

01:13:10.276 --> 01:13:12.570
Yes?

01:13:29.293 --> 01:13:30.920
Forgive me?

01:13:35.837 --> 01:13:37.340
You're back.

01:13:48.098 --> 01:13:50.976
My thanks to you
for my daughter's safe return.

01:13:53.477 --> 01:13:55.480
Kane speaks highly of you.

01:13:55.516 --> 01:13:57.565
Says you'd make a good cattleman.

01:13:57.601 --> 01:13:59.189
I've got a few ideas.

01:13:59.227 --> 01:14:02.067
Well, maybe I can be
of some help to you.

01:14:02.103 --> 01:14:03.818
It's time we had a talk.

01:14:04.902 --> 01:14:06.444
You just rest, Jess.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.948
Come.

01:14:19.414 --> 01:14:21.207
When did you find Jessica?

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.333
Yesterday morning.

01:14:25.751 --> 01:14:27.293
Morning.

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:28.797
Sit down.

01:14:31.422 --> 01:14:33.634
You're very fond of my daughter?

01:14:36.218 --> 01:14:37.969
I love her.

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.971
Mmm. Love?

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:42.305
It's a goddamn strange sort of love.

01:14:42.342 --> 01:14:44.057
Well, would you call it love?

01:14:44.093 --> 01:14:48.894
Take a girl who'd been brought up
to this and put her in a bark hut?

01:14:48.929 --> 01:14:50.438
We'd make do.

01:14:50.476 --> 01:14:54.651
Living on air? Watch her grow old
with hard work and child-bearing?

01:14:54.687 --> 01:14:56.483
I'd look after her.

01:14:56.521 --> 01:14:59.070
Anyway, why don't you ask her?
The decision is yours.

01:14:59.107 --> 01:15:02.866
If you had a spark of man in you, you'd
know the right thing to do is to walk away.

01:15:02.903 --> 01:15:07.243
Now hang on! Your not the only one
that can make something out of life.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.205
I've got plans for my own place.

01:15:09.242 --> 01:15:10.957
Make them
with someone else's daughter.

01:15:10.992 --> 01:15:12.790
I didn't carve this place out

01:15:12.827 --> 01:15:15.709
to see Jessica run off
with some fortune-hunter!

01:15:15.746 --> 01:15:17.751
- You BASTARD!
- Jim!

01:15:28.009 --> 01:15:30.259
How dare you come in this house?

01:15:30.296 --> 01:15:33.639
My long-lost brother.
Didn't recognise you without a gun.

01:15:33.675 --> 01:15:35.182
Get out.

01:15:35.219 --> 01:15:37.724
Gun? What is going on?

01:15:37.761 --> 01:15:41.101
Come on, Jessica. Back to bed.
Oh, no. I'm sick of secrets.

01:15:41.138 --> 01:15:44.230
Get to bed!
And both of you, get out or I'll...!

01:15:44.266 --> 01:15:47.109
- You'll what?
- Blow off the other one?

01:15:47.147 --> 01:15:49.778
Spur... please.

01:15:50.821 --> 01:15:52.906
I only shot to warn you off.

01:15:54.532 --> 01:15:57.866
I'd hate to be around
if your intentions were serious.

01:15:57.903 --> 01:15:59.201
Father!

01:15:59.239 --> 01:16:03.457
Tell me what happened!

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:05.164
- Jessica, go to bed.
- No!

01:16:05.201 --> 01:16:07.000
I have a right to know!

01:16:07.036 --> 01:16:09.333
Oh, for heaven's sake, Harrison!

01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:13.130
Let's get this thing out of the way
once and for all.

01:16:15.132 --> 01:16:18.091
Spur gave your mother
a wedding present - a young colt.

01:16:18.127 --> 01:16:20.259
Old Regret's first foal.

01:16:20.295 --> 01:16:23.928
But your father couldn't stand the thought
of another man giving her anything.

01:16:23.964 --> 01:16:25.848
I wanted to shoot
the animal, but... I couldn't.

01:16:25.885 --> 01:16:30.016
I'm glad you draw the line someware.

01:16:30.053 --> 01:16:32.893
Your mother feared for the horse
and turned it loose.

01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:35.730
Spur saw it running free
and came to tell her.

01:16:35.767 --> 01:16:37.440
And your father found them together.

01:16:37.476 --> 01:16:39.608
Oh, it was all quite innocent, but...

01:16:39.645 --> 01:16:43.445
your father was in a rage
and... Spur was shot.

01:16:43.481 --> 01:16:49.117
Matilda decided to leave…
Enough.

01:16:57.454 --> 01:17:00.832
In a way, she did go of her own accord...

01:17:00.868 --> 01:17:02.793
when you were born.

01:17:11.048 --> 01:17:14.510
You're more a part of this, Jim,
than you realise.

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:18.554
Matilda's colt is now the old stallion.

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:20.515
He leads the brumbies.

01:17:22.723 --> 01:17:27.061
Now, who's to judge a man the rest
of his life for one impetuous act?

01:17:27.098 --> 01:17:28.896
It happened a long time ago.

01:17:28.931 --> 01:17:31.856
I want to forget it...
bare no malice.

01:17:31.893 --> 01:17:33.400
Hey, don't worry.

01:17:33.436 --> 01:17:36.485
It's just the beginning.
Not the end.

01:17:44.241 --> 01:17:45.742
Spur?

01:17:46.952 --> 01:17:50.202
I haven't had so much
feminine attention in years.

01:17:50.238 --> 01:17:51.791
I like it.

01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:56.750
I'm leaving too.

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:08.803
It couldn't work, Jess.

01:18:27.026 --> 01:18:28.068
That's nice.

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:31.280
You come to open the gate,
for your crippled brother.

01:18:31.317 --> 01:18:34.281
You said enough tonight.

01:18:34.318 --> 01:18:37.075
Turning Jessica against me.

01:18:37.111 --> 01:18:39.036
Just as you did Matilda years ago.

01:18:39.072 --> 01:18:41.830
You misjudge the girl.

01:18:41.867 --> 01:18:43.748
Just as you did her mother!

01:18:50.002 --> 01:18:53.962
Whose child is she?

01:18:53.998 --> 01:18:55.467
Poor Mr Harrison.

01:18:55.504 --> 01:18:58.718
You owe me the truth!

01:18:58.754 --> 01:19:00.844
If you realy knew Matilda...

01:19:00.881 --> 01:19:03.553
you could never ask that.

01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:05.263
Of COURSE she's yours!

01:19:05.299 --> 01:19:08.642
But you dont deserve her!

01:19:12.813 --> 01:19:14.316
Hah!

01:19:26.985 --> 01:19:29.407
Oh, bandicoot! Oh!

01:19:29.444 --> 01:19:32.119
Hear you've been up the big house,
boy, eh?

01:19:32.157 --> 01:19:34.411
Did you break in more than the colt

01:19:34.449 --> 01:19:36.956
while you were up on that muster,
hey?

01:19:36.992 --> 01:19:39.250
Did you have to use your spurs, boy?

01:19:40.828 --> 01:19:43.378
You've got the mind
of a gutter rat, Curly!

01:19:46.046 --> 01:19:48.089
CURLY!

01:19:49.339 --> 01:19:51.217
Loose the bottle!

01:19:53.301 --> 01:19:56.721
I did it before...
and so help me, I'll do it again.

01:20:10.478 --> 01:20:11.608
Oooh!

01:20:18.489 --> 01:20:19.489
Oof!

01:20:50.513 --> 01:20:53.764
You know, I could be hard to find
in the mountains.

01:20:55.766 --> 01:20:58.685
You're welcome at my fire any time.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.295
That horse is worth £1,000, Moss.

01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:36.924
- You know how much money?
- Oh, yeah.

01:21:36.961 --> 01:21:41.302
That's more than you'd earn in a lifetime
working for that PRIG Harrison!

01:21:41.338 --> 01:21:43.636
Yeah.
Well, I'm going to fix him.

01:21:51.813 --> 01:21:53.355
Yeah!

01:21:53.392 --> 01:21:55.189
- That fixed him! Yeah!
- Who?

01:21:56.651 --> 01:21:59.401
Bandicoot, you idiot.
They'll think he did that.

01:22:07.951 --> 01:22:09.453
OK.

01:22:14.535 --> 01:22:17.794
Well, it's definite. We found clean tracks.

01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:20.128
The colt's joined the brumby mob.

01:22:20.165 --> 01:22:22.171
Jesus Christ.

01:22:22.207 --> 01:22:25.880
Well, at least he's not been stolen.
Somebody set him loose!

01:22:25.918 --> 01:22:28.885
No prizes guessing who.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.428
Every man from every station about
will be here by morning.

01:22:33.511 --> 01:22:35.139
You find Clancy?

01:22:35.174 --> 01:22:36.930
- Not as yet.
- Well, get him!

01:22:36.967 --> 01:22:38.683
That man's part bloodhound.

01:22:39.851 --> 01:22:41.812
We'll get the colt back, boss.

01:23:00.992 --> 01:23:02.492
No, thanks.

01:23:03.868 --> 01:23:05.997
You don't drink
with your partner?

01:23:07.164 --> 01:23:09.583
- Partner?
- The goldmine.

01:23:09.619 --> 01:23:12.501
Your father always had a half-share in it.

01:23:12.537 --> 01:23:14.751
It's yours now.

01:23:14.787 --> 01:23:17.296
You reckon there's enough in it for two?

01:23:18.379 --> 01:23:19.925
You'd better have a drink.

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:23.385
May be the only thing
you ever get out of the partnership.

01:23:23.422 --> 01:23:25.928
In that case...

01:23:36.932 --> 01:23:38.729
Jesus, Clancy!

01:23:38.765 --> 01:23:41.064
You're going to give me a heart seizure!

01:23:41.101 --> 01:23:44.526
You never could hear anyone else
when you were doing the talking.

01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:47.612
G'day, Jim.

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:49.820
Thought I'd find you here.

01:23:49.857 --> 01:23:51.991
Staring at the mountains.

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:53.532
Yep.

01:23:53.569 --> 01:23:56.034
Only place I'll ever feel at home.

01:23:56.071 --> 01:23:58.454
Aren't you heading
in the wrong direction?

01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:59.954
No.

01:24:01.079 --> 01:24:04.499
Heading back for Harrison's.
You're a demon for punishment.

01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:07.672
Somebody let Harrison's colt go.

01:24:07.706 --> 01:24:09.753
What?!
The colt from Old Regret?

01:24:10.964 --> 01:24:12.925
He's joined the brumbies.

01:24:12.961 --> 01:24:16.092
There's a mob of us
going after him in the morning.

01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:18.593
I thought you might want to be in it.

01:24:25.059 --> 01:24:28.436
Well, they said
you were... good with a horse.

01:24:28.473 --> 01:24:31.938
What's the first thing you do
when a horse bucks you off?

01:24:31.975 --> 01:24:35.024
You don't let him beat you,
you get straight back on.

01:24:35.061 --> 01:24:36.524
Well?

01:24:38.276 --> 01:24:39.777
Well?

01:24:43.113 --> 01:24:44.616
No, Clancy.

01:24:53.998 --> 01:24:55.708
Oh, well, that's a shame.

01:24:58.503 --> 01:25:00.252
Harrison's blaming you for it.

01:25:00.289 --> 01:25:01.754
- Why?
- Me?!

01:25:04.631 --> 01:25:07.633
And you expect me
to go back and help him?

01:25:08.885 --> 01:25:11.262
It's asking too much of a man.

01:25:12.805 --> 01:25:14.974
'Man', did you say?

01:25:15.011 --> 01:25:17.725
That's what my father raised me to be.

01:25:17.761 --> 01:25:19.269
Yes.

01:25:19.306 --> 01:25:21.312
I often think of Henry Craig.

01:25:21.349 --> 01:25:23.024
He was a good man.

01:25:24.648 --> 01:25:27.776
Well... maybe it's just as well.

01:25:28.862 --> 01:25:31.695
Yeah, they probably wouldn't let him
ride with us anyway.

01:25:31.732 --> 01:25:33.197
No.

01:26:33.327 --> 01:26:34.870
Where's Clancy?

01:26:34.907 --> 01:26:36.412
He's not here.

01:26:36.448 --> 01:26:37.916
Goddamn it!

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.666
We can't wait!

01:26:52.128 --> 01:26:53.635
Gentlemen...

01:26:53.671 --> 01:26:57.344
I appreciate the speed
with which you responded to my call.

01:26:58.891 --> 01:27:02.018
My colt, the colt from Old Regret,

01:27:02.054 --> 01:27:05.602
is running with the most cunning mob
that ever crossed the ranges.

01:27:05.639 --> 01:27:07.312
Now, we must be careful.

01:27:09.148 --> 01:27:13.859
I've positioned scouts to send up flares
as soon as they're sighted.

01:27:13.896 --> 01:27:15.987
Now... Hoo!

01:27:21.824 --> 01:27:23.491
Thank you, Clancy.

01:27:23.527 --> 01:27:28.786
- I need your help.
- I'm ready.

01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:31.622
Look at him.

01:27:33.624 --> 01:27:36.334
Come to survey his handiwork. Kane!

01:27:36.371 --> 01:27:38.960
If he'd done it, he wouldn't be here.

01:27:38.997 --> 01:27:41.381
You believe that?
Get him off my property.

01:27:42.465 --> 01:27:43.715
Hold it!

01:27:43.751 --> 01:27:46.383
Both he and his hourse are mountain bred...

01:27:46.421 --> 01:27:48.135
I think he should come along.

01:27:48.171 --> 01:27:49.678
We don't need him.

01:27:49.714 --> 01:27:52.098
- I asked him.
- You did what?

01:27:52.134 --> 01:27:53.849
I want him along.

01:27:55.182 --> 01:27:56.682
As you wish.

01:27:57.892 --> 01:27:59.936
He'll dig his own grave.

01:28:03.689 --> 01:28:05.191
You ride with me.

01:28:12.112 --> 01:28:13.613
Come on!

01:28:14.238 --> 01:28:17.284
Gentlemen...

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:21.660
there will be a reward,
to be divided among you as you like,

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:23.664
when the colt is recovered...

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.205
£100.

01:29:17.287 --> 01:29:18.831
Hey!

01:29:18.868 --> 01:29:20.543
Mrs Bailey!

01:29:22.042 --> 01:29:24.670
All the men have just left.

01:29:24.707 --> 01:29:26.213
Well...

01:29:26.249 --> 01:29:29.299
Where'd they go?!

01:29:29.336 --> 01:29:32.218
Oh, I so wanted
to go with them.

01:29:32.255 --> 01:29:36.721
But... somebody's got to stay here
and look after the womenfolk, right?

01:29:53.316 --> 01:29:55.026
How's he pulling up, Jim?

01:29:55.062 --> 01:29:58.156
Raring to go. Thanks for your help.

01:30:12.666 --> 01:30:14.501
Clancy, wheel 'em to the right.

01:30:17.544 --> 01:30:19.462
No fancy riding!

01:30:19.499 --> 01:30:21.463
We'll have them from the jump.

01:31:43.989 --> 01:31:45.490
Yah!

01:32:38.448 --> 01:32:39.949
Yah!

01:33:09.634 --> 01:33:13.475
Hey, Curly!
First bath for the week?

01:33:21.147 --> 01:33:22.648
Wait for me!

01:34:43.296 --> 01:34:45.797
You can bid the mob good day.

01:35:01.221 --> 01:35:02.726
Look!

01:37:04.534 --> 01:37:06.035
Where's Jim?

01:37:08.328 --> 01:37:10.247
Glory be!

01:37:10.283 --> 01:37:11.955
Will you look at that?!

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:38.101
Hah!

01:38:09.168 --> 01:38:10.669
Hah!

01:39:29.691 --> 01:39:36.653
Hey... promised £100.

01:39:36.689 --> 01:39:38.153
It's yours.

01:39:40.073 --> 01:39:41.783
That's not why I rode.

01:39:48.456 --> 01:39:51.376
There are a dozen good brood mares
in that mob.

01:39:51.412 --> 01:39:53.085
I'll be back for them.

01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:00.466
And for whatever else is mine.

01:40:00.502 --> 01:40:02.550
I don't like to repeat myself.

01:40:02.586 --> 01:40:04.219
She's not for you.

01:40:04.255 --> 01:40:06.719
Jessica can make up her own mind
about that.

01:40:06.756 --> 01:40:09.263
You've got a long way to go yet, lad.

01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:11.349
He's not a lad... brother.

01:40:11.386 --> 01:40:13.141
He's a man.

01:40:16.935 --> 01:40:18.437
He's a MAN!

01:40:28.903 --> 01:40:31.239
The Man from Snowy River.
