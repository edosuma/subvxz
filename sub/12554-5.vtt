00:12.812 --> 00:15.882
<i>There's an extraterrestrial</i>

00:22.489 --> 00:24.324
<i>her adopted</i>

00:24.391 --> 00:27.160

(SCREAMS)

00:46.279 --> 00:47.747
-Ready?
-Always.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.923
<i>Hi. I'm Joseph Serf.</i>

00:56.990 --> 01:00.593
<i>I'm here to introduce</i>
<i>the Serf Board</i>
<i>from Serf Systems,</i>

01:00.660 --> 01:04.263
<i>the world's newest</i>
<i>and best portable computer.</i>

01:04.330 --> 01:08.601
<i>The 15th at 5pm.</i>
<i>Put it in your diary.</i>

01:08.668 --> 01:13.006
<i>The day the Serf Board arrives</i>
<i>and the revolution begins.</i>

01:13.072 --> 01:15.642
<i>Billions of</i>
<i>dollars of research</i>
<i>and development...</i>

01:15.708 --> 01:18.211
Where's my billion dollars,
Mr Serf?

01:18.278 --> 01:19.112
<i>...have gone into</i>
<i>this portable device.</i>

01:20.980 --> 01:25.885
<i>Excuse me. Did I say device?</i>
<i>I mean friend.</i>

01:25.952 --> 01:28.555
<i>From the 15th,</i>
<i>the world will have</i>
<i>another question to ask.</i>

01:28.621 --> 01:30.123
(SQUEAKING)

01:30.190 --> 01:32.659
<i>How did we manage</i>
<i>before the Serf Board?</i>

01:33.893 --> 01:34.861
Hello?

01:35.695 --> 01:36.930
(SQUEAKING)

01:43.937 --> 01:44.971
Hello?

01:48.475 --> 01:49.876
(LIFT BELL DINGS)

01:54.614 --> 01:55.582
Idiot.

01:57.183 --> 01:58.651
(CHITTERING)

02:00.019 --> 02:01.321
(SCREAMS)

02:01.521 --> 02:03.756
<i>Do you want to</i>
<i>see tomorrow today?</i>

02:22.342 --> 02:23.543
Morning, Sky.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.445
Well, I think I've got
everything he wants.

02:25.512 --> 02:28.548
"Oh, it doesn't matter,
Mum," he says,
and then when he turns up,

02:28.615 --> 02:31.584
it's straight to the fridge
and "Why haven't
we got any bacon?"

02:31.651 --> 02:35.455
Well, let him starve. When
I went up to Oxford,
the cupboards were bare.

02:37.223 --> 02:38.558
Are you all right, Sky?

02:38.625 --> 02:42.161
Just a little nervous.
Meeting Luke face-to-face,

02:42.228 --> 02:44.464
not just on the screen.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.066
Well, you couldn't have
a better brother.

02:52.372 --> 02:55.074
Oh, right, yeah.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.545
Not my room any more.

03:04.617 --> 03:07.086
(BEEPING)

03:07.153 --> 03:09.923
-Luke! Oh, welcome home.
-Hi, Mum.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.394
-Hi, Clani!
-Don't call us that!

03:14.460 --> 03:16.596
Clani? Who's Clani?

03:16.663 --> 03:19.666
-Clyde, Rani, Clani.
-It's meant to be funny.

03:19.732 --> 03:21.668
He can't keep away.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.504
Luke, meet Sky, in person.

03:24.571 --> 03:28.041
Sky. Hi. Hi, Sky!

03:28.107 --> 03:29.842
You're taller than
you look on webcam.

03:30.476 --> 03:33.413
Yes. Yes, I am.

03:33.479 --> 03:37.517
Sorry, I just went in your
room, I forgot it's
not mine any more.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.353
It's the best room
and you don't
live here any more.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.888
Its fine, it's really fine.

03:44.857 --> 03:48.928
Hey, finally face-to-face.

03:49.128 --> 03:52.932
It's the clash of the nerds.
Sky,
behold my greatest success.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.835
Frankenbane's monster,
now a normal human student,

03:55.902 --> 03:59.806
living off Pot Noodles, rising
at 12 sharp to
watch <i>Loose Women.</i>

03:59.872 --> 04:02.108
Yeah, shut up.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.812
-Sky, I really hope
we can be friends.
-Of course we'll be friends.

04:05.878 --> 04:09.015
I suppose we're sort of
brother and sister.

04:10.817 --> 04:11.851
-Tea?
-Yeah.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.788
I had to leave K9 back at Uni.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.891
But look. I made this.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.862
A dog whistle.
'Cause you never know.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.364
What's he doing up there?

04:24.430 --> 04:26.132
He's backing up
the Bodleian Library.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.468
The whole lot!
He wouldn't come back with me.

04:28.534 --> 04:31.671
MR SMITH: <i>Oh, good...ness me,</i>
<i>what a terrible shame.</i>

04:31.738 --> 04:34.073
Oi, Mr Smith, don't be nasty.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.442
We could always swap you
for another computer.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.211
Like the Serf Board!

04:38.277 --> 04:40.680
<i>I hardly think that would be</i>
<i>a good exchange.</i>

04:40.747 --> 04:43.716
Well, it's the launch
this afternoon, at five!

04:43.783 --> 04:48.588
SERF: <i>...affordable device.</i>
<i>Excuse me. Did I say device?</i>

04:48.655 --> 04:50.523
And nobody knows what it does
when you switch it on.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.225
The rumours say everything!

04:52.291 --> 04:54.994
There's a rehearsal
of the launch this morning.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.196
Just three of the country's
very top journalists

04:57.263 --> 04:58.965
have been invited to watch.

04:59.032 --> 05:02.168
Do you know any of them?
Could you, like, blag us in?

05:02.235 --> 05:04.804
Um, I said just the top
journalists have been invited.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.706
Yeah,
so what if we swap a ticket?

05:08.708 --> 05:10.677
I mean me. Me!

05:10.743 --> 05:14.981
What do you think
pays for all this?
Taking in washing?

05:15.048 --> 05:17.950
Sorry, I just didn't think it
was your kind of a story.

05:18.017 --> 05:21.354
-Yeah,
almost good enough, Rani.
-I am not going to miss that!

05:21.421 --> 05:23.790
Oh, who said
you're going to miss it?
Homecoming treat.

05:23.856 --> 05:24.991
I'm not going to miss it,
either!

05:25.058 --> 05:27.193
Fine, sure, you can come,
too, Sky.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.027
And?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.798
Oh, I'm sorry,
that's all I could manage.

05:31.864 --> 05:34.667
I shouldn't really
be taking anybody,
it's highly unprofessional.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.869
That's so unfair.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.872
Sorry, Clani. Family outing.

05:42.542 --> 05:46.212
LUKE: Basically, we blab
anything about the Serf Board
before the actual release

05:46.279 --> 05:48.147
and they sue us to death.

05:48.214 --> 05:50.516
But what if I disagree
with the terms and conditions?

05:50.583 --> 05:52.251
They're fine, just sign it.

05:52.318 --> 05:54.954
Believe me,
if he says they're fine,
they're fine.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.690
Whatever you say.

05:57.757 --> 06:00.893
Sarah Jane Smith!

06:02.195 --> 06:05.665
Let me drink you in.
As lovely as ever.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.869
Oh, Luke, Sky, Lionel Carson.

06:09.936 --> 06:13.005
-An old, old friend.
-I could have
been so much more.

06:13.072 --> 06:16.275
Now I am a ruin.
You remain a paragon!

06:16.342 --> 06:19.278
Lionel was my editor when
I first started
on the nationals.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.380
And then he moved
on to food and wine.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.850
So why are you
covering the Serf Board,
Mr Carson?

06:23.916 --> 06:27.386
I pulled rank.
To impress my grandchildren.

06:27.453 --> 06:30.223
I've met the great Mr Serf.

06:30.289 --> 06:32.625
I leave the technical stuff
to you young people.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.660
I can't abide computers.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.964
Nothing wrong with
a typewriter, says I.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.866
What's a typewriter?

06:39.932 --> 06:43.402
Goodness me! Make me feel
even more old-fashioned,
why don't you?

06:43.469 --> 06:46.439
Oh, you were
already old-fashioned
when I was newfangled.

06:46.506 --> 06:47.940
My son and my daughter.

06:50.376 --> 06:54.113
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

06:54.180 --> 06:57.950
I'm John Harrison,
Serf Systems Public Relations.

06:58.017 --> 07:02.155
The rehearsal is about
to begin so if you'd like
to follow me up.

07:02.221 --> 07:03.389
Well, that's us.

07:03.456 --> 07:06.859
Would you care
to accompany me,
o radiant one,

07:06.926 --> 07:09.862
in memory of what
might have been?

07:09.929 --> 07:10.997
Oh, go on, then.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.732
(BOTH LAUGHING)

07:13.633 --> 07:15.168
(BUZZING)

07:15.234 --> 07:17.937
-Luke, can you feel that?
-Feel what?

07:18.137 --> 07:20.807
Electricity building up.
It's strong.

07:20.873 --> 07:23.643
Probably just
a storm on the way.

07:23.709 --> 07:27.013
No, this feels different,
strange.

07:27.079 --> 07:32.485
And then I shall say,
"Please say hi
to Joseph Serf."

07:32.552 --> 07:34.387
And cue Mr Serf.

07:40.459 --> 07:42.328
Not half bad in the flesh.

07:42.395 --> 07:46.666
He's like you, Sarah Jane,
he's got charisma.

07:46.732 --> 07:50.469
Thank you, Johnny.
Then I'll say,
"Pleased to meet you."

07:50.536 --> 07:52.972
And then I'll do this.

07:53.039 --> 07:55.641
"Whoa,
who's that beautiful guy?"

07:55.708 --> 07:58.477
Yes, very good,
sir, very spontaneous.

07:58.544 --> 08:01.848
-What next?
-You stand there, sir,

08:01.914 --> 08:06.519
and your close-ups
will be in camera three.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.654
Is the teleprompter
in the right position, sir?

08:08.721 --> 08:11.757
Yeah, looking good to me.
And then
straight into the spiel?

08:11.824 --> 08:13.059
Straight into the spiel, sir.

08:15.428 --> 08:20.466
The Serf Board
will revolutionise the way
we work, the way we play.

08:20.533 --> 08:24.737
Every home should have one.
Soon,
every home will have one.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.473
That was perfect, sir.

08:27.540 --> 08:31.978
And then the attendees
will each be given
a Serf Board, like so.

08:35.214 --> 08:36.549
SERF: The Serf Board.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.852
Take it home,
press go, play and learn.

08:41.953 --> 08:46.158
It's a phenomenon.
And you're going to love it.

08:46.225 --> 08:49.395
-You're going to love it.
-"Why wait?" is my motto.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.999
SERF: Download,
browse, photos, books,
everything.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.033
You're going to love it.

08:55.568 --> 08:58.638
It's the future, its tomorrow

08:59.472 --> 09:01.007
and you love it.

09:02.508 --> 09:06.612
You want one, you need one,
everybody wants one,

09:06.679 --> 09:09.248
everybody's got to get one.

09:09.315 --> 09:10.516
(WHISPERS) Did you see that?

09:10.583 --> 09:13.719
(WHISPERS) Yeah,
but that's impossible.

09:13.786 --> 09:17.623
Um, excuse me, can we have
a little bit of hush, please?

09:17.690 --> 09:20.726
-But Sarah Jane, he...
-Quiet, Sky. Wait.

09:20.793 --> 09:24.196
-But you did see that?
-Yes, but nobody else did.

09:24.263 --> 09:27.466
Its tomorrow and you love it.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.772
It's so easy to use!

09:32.838 --> 09:36.809
He was right,
it's a revolution!
It's beautiful. I love it!

09:36.876 --> 09:38.744
Well, it must be
good to impress you.

09:38.811 --> 09:43.716
I never saw the point
of computers but this,
this is so easy to use.

09:43.783 --> 09:47.787
-I'll see you at the launch.
-Bye.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.856
Ah, look what you've got.
Hurrah for Mum.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.859
Hurrah for Mum.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.762
Something weird
happened in there.
To Mr Serf.

09:56.829 --> 09:59.598
-What are you talking about?
-Mum, he glitched.

09:59.665 --> 10:03.035
-He what?
-Just for a moment,
he flickered.

10:03.102 --> 10:06.272
Right, back home.
We need to check this out.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.441
What if I stay,
look for more glitches?

10:08.507 --> 10:10.843
There could be other people
like Serf, whatever he is.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.345
Good idea.
Where shall we start?

10:12.411 --> 10:14.447
Oh, no. Luke is old enough
to look after himself.

10:14.513 --> 10:15.548
And I'm not?

10:16.916 --> 10:18.918
No, you're not. Sorry.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.087
You be careful.
Come on, Sky, home.

10:24.490 --> 10:27.626
Right!
Let's have a look
at you, my beauty.

10:27.693 --> 10:30.830
No, Clyde, wait.
We should check it out first.

10:30.896 --> 10:32.932
Only Luke and
me saw it happen.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.034
Well,
Luke's got superior senses,

10:35.101 --> 10:38.671
and Sky's
sensitive to electrical
fluctuations, however tiny.

10:38.738 --> 10:41.040
Mr Smith, tap into
the digital database.

10:41.107 --> 10:44.677
The rehearsal was recorded,
so somebody at Serf must have
sent the movie file.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.445
Get us a copy.

10:46.512 --> 10:49.148
MR SMITH: <i>That may take some</i>
<i>considerable time, Sarah Jane.</i>

10:49.215 --> 10:50.483
<i>Here you are.</i>

10:50.549 --> 10:53.486
Hey, you're doing
that on purpose now.

10:53.552 --> 10:57.690
It was when Serf was saying
"Everybody will
want a Serf Board."

10:57.757 --> 11:00.793
SERF:
<i>You want one, you need one,</i>
<i>everybody wants one,</i>

11:00.860 --> 11:02.595
<i>everybody's got to get one.</i>

11:02.661 --> 11:08.434
Freeze it between
frame 04:34:21 and 23.

11:12.071 --> 11:15.841
-There's nothing there.
You imagined it.
-I did not!

11:15.908 --> 11:18.711
Roll back a tenth
of a frame, Mr Smith.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.112
MR SMITH:
<i>Time flexing applied.</i>

11:21.647 --> 11:23.783
-That's impossible!
<i>-Enhancing.</i>

11:26.352 --> 11:27.953
But that's not the recording,
that's him!

11:28.020 --> 11:29.355
The rest of the picture
didn't move.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.290
That's what I've been telling
you.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.827
I'm getting just a bit
suspicious. And preparing to
say the A-word.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.929
-What A-word?
-Aliens.

11:37.129 --> 11:39.932
Mr Smith, give us everything
you've got on Joseph Serf!

11:40.132 --> 11:41.801
What is he?

11:41.867 --> 11:46.572
<i>Joseph Samuel Serf,</i>
<i>born Dayton,</i>
<i>Ohio, 25th of May, 1972.</i>

11:46.639 --> 11:49.675
<i>Graduated Harvard 1993,</i>

11:49.742 --> 11:54.513
<i>founded Serf Systems,</i>
<i>then completely</i>
<i>disappeared from public view</i>

11:54.580 --> 11:59.185
<i>after</i>
<i>a near-fatal skiing accident</i>
<i>in Val d'Isere in 2007.</i>

11:59.251 --> 12:02.221
<i>Following this,</i>
<i>he became famously reclusive.</i>

12:02.288 --> 12:04.557
<i>No interviews or pictures.</i>

12:04.623 --> 12:10.329
<i>The only images available</i>
<i>after this date are these</i>
<i>publicity photographs.</i>

12:10.396 --> 12:15.301
Look.
In all these photographs,
he never once holds anything.

12:15.367 --> 12:19.438
-He never touches anybody.
-So, what, he's a hologram?

12:19.505 --> 12:22.508
No, no, more than that.
He walks,
talks, interacts with people.

12:22.575 --> 12:27.179
He's amazing!
This technology,
it's fantastic!

12:27.246 --> 12:28.981
But he sits down.
He gets into cars.

12:29.048 --> 12:31.884
It's like a photo.
You can fold it up
and move it around.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.819
Aye-aye.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.122
Who's that guy that's
always right next
to him, who's he?

12:36.188 --> 12:38.858
John Harrison,
PR for Serf Systems.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.393
The skiing accident.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.929
The real Serf,
he died in that accident.
He was replaced.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.798
MR SMITH:
<i>And shortly afterwards,</i>

12:45.865 --> 12:48.467
<i>Serf Systems</i>
<i>began the development</i>
<i>of the Serf Board.</i>

12:48.534 --> 12:51.036
Ah, wait. Lionel.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.907
He hates computers. But the
moment he switched that on,
he raved about it!

12:54.974 --> 12:58.911
This Serf Board,
what if it's got
some sort of hypnotic power?

12:58.978 --> 13:02.181
They replaced Serf
and took over his company.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.983
But why? What's this all for?

13:04.049 --> 13:06.652
And today's the launch.
A Serf Board in every home?

13:06.719 --> 13:07.953
You can count me out.

13:08.020 --> 13:12.224
Mr Smith, deep scan,
full spectrum analysis.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.261
Let's see what Luke finds out.

13:15.327 --> 13:20.166
And while we wait,
I want
an interview with Mr Serf.

13:20.232 --> 13:22.668
But he doesn't do interviews,
ever.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.936
Watch and learn, Rani.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.642
Mr Serf does not
give interviews,
Miss Smith.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.311
SARAH JANE:
<i>Oh, but the Serf Board,</i>
<i>it's just amazing!</i>

13:32.378 --> 13:35.381
I have to do
a personal follow-up
with Mr Serf.

13:35.447 --> 13:37.383
HARRISON: <i>You are invited</i>
<i>to the launch later.</i>

13:37.449 --> 13:40.119
Oh, well, if I could just
speak to Mr Serf,

13:40.186 --> 13:41.854
just to tell him
there are no glitches.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.860
Go on, Miss Smith.

13:47.927 --> 13:52.331
Oh,
well, Mr Serf seems so warm,
so real, so natural.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.700
And I'm sure my readers
would like to get to know

13:54.767 --> 13:57.036
such a genuine human being.

13:57.102 --> 14:00.172
Well,
that's different, Miss Smith.
Please come right over.

14:00.239 --> 14:01.874
That's marvellous.
I'll see you soon.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.712
One of
the country's top journalists.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.948
Wow, Sarah Jane. Just wow!

14:09.014 --> 14:11.684
Isn't that a bit dangerous,
though?
They know you know.

14:11.750 --> 14:16.155
Oh, I know they know I know.
That's the only way to get in.

14:16.222 --> 14:19.358
And they know you know
they know you know.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.360
SARAH JANE: Sometimes
that's the best way.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.929
I need to bring Serf Systems
out into the open,

14:24.129 --> 14:25.998
find out what
they're planning.

14:26.065 --> 14:29.001
And you need me. I saw
the glitch and I might see
something else.

14:29.068 --> 14:31.103
What, another family outing?

14:31.170 --> 14:35.207
Yeah, okay. No, no, you wait
here. Find out what Mr
Smith makes of that.

14:35.274 --> 14:36.108
Come on, let's go!

14:43.015 --> 14:45.084
What's up?

14:45.150 --> 14:47.853
It's daft.
But I feel like
it's watching us.

14:50.789 --> 14:52.157
How goes the spying?

14:52.224 --> 14:53.859
I checked the car park,
hung about in reception,

14:53.926 --> 14:55.561
got a coffee
from their machine,
but nothing.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.463
No more glitching,
nothing weird.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.365
It's time for your interview.

14:59.431 --> 15:02.901
Okay. Meet you both back here
in half an hour.

15:05.237 --> 15:09.675
Miss Smith!
I hear you're
a fan of the Board.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.411
I certainly am, Mr Serf!

15:12.478 --> 15:16.382
-Call me Sarah Jane.
-Joseph.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.319
I'm sorry,
I can't shake your hand.

15:20.386 --> 15:23.088
Oh. Really? Why ever not?

15:23.155 --> 15:26.692
Mr Serf suffers from
an acute peanut allergy.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.127
I haven't been eating nuts.

15:28.193 --> 15:30.829
But you might have been
in a nutty environment.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.331
Can't be too careful.

15:32.398 --> 15:34.500
Oh, I'm so sorry.
How very convenient.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.869
Sorry, of course I
mean "inconvenient".

15:38.270 --> 15:41.006
Does Mr Harrison
need to be here, Joseph?

15:41.073 --> 15:45.744
Actually, I'd prefer to stay.

15:45.811 --> 15:49.315
After all, I'd hate there
to be any more glitches.

15:49.381 --> 15:50.749
Oh,
with you around, Mr Harrison,

15:50.816 --> 15:52.918
I'm sure everything
will run like clockwork.

15:52.985 --> 15:55.187
Oh, yes.

15:55.254 --> 15:58.023
I pride myself I can deal
with any old spanners that
get into those works.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.426
(COUGHING)

16:00.492 --> 16:04.396
Um, before we start, could
I get something to drink?
I'm parched.

16:04.463 --> 16:08.000
Certainly, Miss Smith.
Tea? Coffee?

16:08.067 --> 16:09.368
-(SOFTLY) Anthrax?
-What was that?

16:09.435 --> 16:10.502
Nothing.

16:10.569 --> 16:11.937
(CHUCKLES)

16:14.406 --> 16:16.508
No,
I'll just have water, please.

16:18.877 --> 16:21.847
Nice, clear water
that I can see right through.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.249
Coming right up.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.219
Wouldn't you
like some, Joseph?
It's very hot in here.

16:27.286 --> 16:30.556
I'm fine, thank you.
Now, let's talk
about the Serf Board.

16:30.622 --> 16:33.659
Yes, let's.

16:35.394 --> 16:38.464
-MR SMITH: <i>Deep scan complete.</i>
-Oh, tell us the worst.

16:38.530 --> 16:42.568
<i>The Serf Board is a standard</i>
<i>low-specification</i>
<i>laptop computer.</i>

16:42.634 --> 16:44.703
-And?
<i>-That is all.</i>

16:44.770 --> 16:46.271
Well, it can't be.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.108
The hologram, the big launch
tonight, one in every home.

16:49.174 --> 16:49.942
Hold on.

16:54.346 --> 16:59.251
(WHISPERS) Right.
What if this has got at him?

16:59.318 --> 17:03.422
MR SMITH:
<i>I can hear you, Clyde.</i>
<i>And no, it hasn't got me.</i>

17:03.489 --> 17:06.090
Well, it's not the first time
you've said something was okay

17:06.157 --> 17:07.726
and it turned
out to be deadly.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.796
-Do you remember the Rakweed?
-Oop! Leave it alone.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.598
-We wait for
the others to get back.
-But there's not much time!

17:13.665 --> 17:16.402
How are you going to feel
tonight when everyone's
walking down Bannerman Road

17:16.468 --> 17:19.438
with their arms out, going,
"Serve the computer."

17:19.505 --> 17:21.807
Clyde, no.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.442
Oh,
come on, the clock's ticking.

17:23.509 --> 17:24.510
Let's just switch it on,
see what it does.

17:24.576 --> 17:27.346
Oh! Okay. But we do it my way.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.847
We take precautions.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.720
The implication
for global communications...

17:34.787 --> 17:37.923
Oh... Butterfingers!

17:37.990 --> 17:40.926
Would you mind
picking that up for me,
Joseph?

17:40.993 --> 17:44.863
Oh, please,
Miss Smith, do use mine.

17:51.537 --> 17:55.040
-An electrical surge?
-No, it feels strange.

17:55.107 --> 17:58.010
-Coming from down below.
-We'll tell Mum
when she gets back.

18:01.046 --> 18:03.148
Let's take a look.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.583
Come on, it's what you
always do.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.151
I'll go, you go back
to the car.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.554
-Not a chance.
-Sky!

18:11.590 --> 18:14.626
Going down! How's the liking
each other thing going now?

18:14.693 --> 18:16.128
I'll let you know.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.706
-Hey, it was my idea!
-Yeah, but it
needs a delicate touch.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.142
Well, I'm delicate,

18:30.209 --> 18:33.378
in a very manly way.
I've got artist's fingers!

18:36.982 --> 18:40.786
Just like the old days.
You and me, having a laugh.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.856
Yeah. I meant to say,
all that stuff with Ellie...

18:44.590 --> 18:45.858
It's okay.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.828
Right, let's do this!

18:52.264 --> 18:54.533
(SOFT BEEPING)

19:02.107 --> 19:04.309
(CHOKED HOWLING)

19:04.376 --> 19:07.646
Okay,
I can't sense the electrical
surge, but I can hear that!

19:07.713 --> 19:09.181
(HOWLING CONTINUES)

19:09.248 --> 19:12.684
-Coming from further down.
-But this is the bottom floor.

19:12.751 --> 19:15.287
Unless there's
an override command.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.556
I can reverse-intuit the code.

19:21.059 --> 19:22.027
-(BELL DINGS)
-Knew it!

19:28.433 --> 19:31.470
There's nothing.
Really, nothing.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.639
-So,
I'm going to take these off.
-Careful!

19:37.142 --> 19:39.645
In fact, it's more than
a of bit rubbish.
Its bog standard.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.747
What's so special about this?

19:41.813 --> 19:44.550
It's not the Board itself.
That's normal.

19:44.616 --> 19:47.052
-It looks cool, that's all.
-MR SMITH:
<i>What did I tell you?</i>

19:48.387 --> 19:49.988
Then what is going on?

20:00.532 --> 20:01.700
Down here!

20:22.354 --> 20:24.590
(HOWLING CONTINUES)

20:28.093 --> 20:29.595
(GROWLING)

20:33.398 --> 20:35.634
Whatever it is,
it's through there.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.639
-SARAH JANE: <i>But Mr Serf...</i>
-That's Mum!

20:40.706 --> 20:45.110
<i>I mean, you've revolutionised</i>
<i>the entire</i>
<i>concept of mobile work.</i>

20:45.177 --> 20:49.147
SERF: <i>Our dedicated team</i>
<i>of specialists made improving</i>
<i>the functionality...</i>

20:49.214 --> 20:50.649
(VOICES GET LOUDER)
<i>...their number one priority.</i>

20:52.384 --> 20:54.019
SARAH JANE:
<i>Well, you must have</i>
<i>been amazed, Joseph,</i>

20:54.086 --> 20:56.955
<i>when you got your hands</i>
<i>on the keyboard</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

20:57.022 --> 21:00.759
<i>I mean, to see your dreams</i>
<i>made into a solid reality.</i>

21:00.826 --> 21:05.631
<i>I'd love to tell my readers</i>
<i>how that felt from your</i>
<i>unique point of view.</i>

21:05.697 --> 21:08.900
SERF: <i>It's a screwy market.</i>
<i>But I always had</i>
<i>faith in my tech guys.</i>

21:19.378 --> 21:20.145
Keep up!

21:21.847 --> 21:22.914
Keep up!

21:25.851 --> 21:28.353
SERF: <i>...the ideas man.</i>

21:28.420 --> 21:32.391
SARAH JANE: <i>Well, ideas can be</i>
<i>so intangible, can't they?</i>

21:32.457 --> 21:34.660
<i>Oh, dear. What am I saying?</i>

21:34.726 --> 21:36.428
That's okay, Miss Smith.

21:37.295 --> 21:38.063
Smile!

21:45.337 --> 21:46.705
Joseph, are you all right?

21:46.772 --> 21:48.707
Stay up, stay up.
Keep up, keep up!

21:50.142 --> 21:51.810
(SQUEAKING)

21:53.011 --> 21:55.847
(GROANING) Keep up, keep up!

21:59.918 --> 22:02.154
We all say
thongs we don't moan.

22:04.289 --> 22:05.857
Spelling, spelling!

22:08.427 --> 22:10.729
Forgove me,
things we don't mean.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.667
Keep shadow in sync,
and smile again!

22:21.006 --> 22:23.475
Thoughtful smile,
not sexy smile!

22:30.315 --> 22:32.084
It's incredible!

22:32.150 --> 22:35.787
They're controlling him.
Everything
he says and does, it's them.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.766
-What else do
you want to know?
-Um... Ooh!

22:47.833 --> 22:49.901
A spillage! Emergency stand!

22:51.369 --> 22:52.871
Steady on thumb.

22:54.072 --> 22:58.877
And one, two, three and up!

23:03.048 --> 23:04.850
Crease fabric, crease fabric!

23:08.386 --> 23:09.921
I'm so sorry.

23:09.988 --> 23:12.524
HARRISON:
What a clumsy clot you are,
Miss Smith.

23:12.591 --> 23:18.230
One of our country's most
famously shrewd
journalists is,

23:18.296 --> 23:22.267
apparently,
such a loveable scatterbrain.

23:22.334 --> 23:23.869
Well, Miss Smoth.

23:27.272 --> 23:29.941
Miss Smith.
What else do you want to know?

23:30.008 --> 23:33.545
Well, I just hope I can stop
embarrassing myself,
for a start.

23:33.612 --> 23:35.247
Hypno to 10.

23:35.313 --> 23:37.949
Hypno-power to 10,
hypno-power to 10.

23:39.050 --> 23:41.219
She must trust,
she must trust!

23:41.286 --> 23:42.053
Mum...

23:45.891 --> 23:48.927
You love the Serf Board,
Sarah Jane.

23:48.994 --> 23:52.531
SERF: <i>It's</i>
<i>the most amazing computer</i>
<i>you've ever seen.</i>

23:52.597 --> 23:54.866
Stronger hypno,
stronger hypno!

23:58.837 --> 24:03.942
And I am the most amazing man
you've ever seen.

24:04.009 --> 24:07.846
Yes, yes.
You're such
a handsome man, Mr Serf.

24:09.714 --> 24:13.585
But I'm an old
hand at hypnotism.
And when it comes to men,

24:13.652 --> 24:17.556
I actually prefer something
I can grab hold of! Gotcha!

24:17.622 --> 24:23.728
Failure! Light sculpture
failed! Failed!
Stand down, await orders!

24:27.699 --> 24:30.135
This is alien technology!

24:32.904 --> 24:35.340
And it's pretty erratic.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.943
Alien technology?

24:38.009 --> 24:42.113
You mean,
something that's not made
on this planet? Like this?

You!

Please,
let her go, she's my sister.
She's just a child! Please!

-They're going to kill us!

We're in!

and it's me and the missus.

for your lives.
