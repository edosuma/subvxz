00:21.440 --> 00:22.965
I'm home, darling!

00:23.000 --> 00:25.605
I was thinking, we should invite
your parents round soon.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.165
I love spending time with them.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.405
They're so wise and
such wonderful company.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.760
Oh, what a coincidence,
I didn't know you were both here.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.165
So you didn't notice our car outside?

00:35.200 --> 00:38.125
Oh, come on, Geoffrey, lots of
people drive a maroon Rover 700

00:38.160 --> 00:41.325
with yellow steering lock
and beaded seat covers.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.645
But they don't park them
right outside your house.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.720
Parked? It was so far from the kerb,
I thought it'd been abandoned.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.125
Well, it's nice to see you, Lee.
It feels like it's been ages.

00:51.160 --> 00:55.325
Yes, when in fact we've only been
talking for about ten seconds.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.805
Truth is, we've hardly been able
to leave the house

00:57.840 --> 00:59.045
for the last two months.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.365
Not another ASBO, Wendy?

01:01.400 --> 01:04.640
What was it this time, knock down
ginger at the local vicarage?

01:05.960 --> 01:07.725
Dad's been showing me his new extension.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.400
Well, you're never too old
for cosmetic enhancement, Geoffrey.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.405
The kitchen extension.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.165
It's been extremely hard.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.525
Geoffrey's worked his way
through half the tradesmen

01:17.560 --> 01:19.125
in the south-east.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.165
I'm glad we clarified things
before you said that.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.605
It's been very stressful, so I'm
taking him down to Beachy Head.

01:25.640 --> 01:26.800
Bit harsh.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.325
Just a weekend break
to recharge the batteries.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.845
It's a shame, there's still
a few niggly little jobs left.

01:33.880 --> 01:37.045
You know, unpacking,
tidying, dusting and so on.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.405
It would have been nice to come
back to a clean and tidy house.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.445
Well, I can sort those things
out for you, Dad.

01:42.480 --> 01:45.565
Really? Well, if you're sure it
won't be too much trouble for you.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.685
It won't be any trouble
whatsoever for me...

01:47.720 --> 01:49.320
..I'll send Lee to do it.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.565
Er, actually, on second thoughts,

01:53.600 --> 01:56.245
I'm sure it can wait until we get back.

01:56.280 --> 02:00.285
I'm sorry, did you just quickly look
me up on Checkatrade or something?

02:00.320 --> 02:03.205
I can tidy up and dust.
You won't even know I've been there.

02:03.240 --> 02:04.480
Sadly, that's true.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.525
Just write me a list.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.164
I'd be taking advantage of you.

02:09.199 --> 02:12.005
Well, you're not putting
that on the list.

02:12.040 --> 02:15.005
It's OK, Dad. Lee and I will go
together and both clean up.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.285
- Well, hmm...
- It'll be fine, Dad.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.725
- Course it will, Geoffrey.
- Thank you, Wendy.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.765
They're simple little jobs.
A chimpanzee could do them.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.760
I am still stood here, you know?

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:34.680 --> 02:37.485
- One day, we'll own a kitchen like this.
- Really?

02:37.520 --> 02:40.040
Yeah. Unless your parents
cut you out of their will.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.125
Ooh, I didn't know
your mum smoked cigars.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.125
I always had her down as
a chewing tobacco kind of gal.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.085
- They're Dad's, and they're lethal.
- Why?

02:49.120 --> 02:51.760
Because if you touch them,
he'll kill you.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.640
Do you know how you can tell
if something is glass or crystal?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.445
Glass.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.485
Why don't you go outside
and... check on the garden?

03:04.520 --> 03:07.725
Oh, keep out the way, you mean.
Like father, like daughter.

03:07.760 --> 03:11.205
And I'm not just talking
about the excessive nasal hair.

03:11.240 --> 03:13.165
I suppose I could mow the lawn.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.685
- Your dad might thank me.
- He does hate doing that.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.245
What, mowing the lawn or thanking me?

03:18.280 --> 03:20.880
Go on, then. Just try not to...

03:22.640 --> 03:25.000
- What?
- I don't know, just... try not to.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.960
PHONE RINGS

03:34.480 --> 03:36.925
Hi, Dad. How's it all going?

03:36.960 --> 03:38.525
Oh, it's all great.

03:38.560 --> 03:43.725
I just had to phone to tell you
the hotel does a continental buffet,

03:43.760 --> 03:46.765
and I thought you might be
interested, you voted Remain.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.245
You're checking up on us, aren't you?

03:49.280 --> 03:52.045
- Well, maybe a bit.
- Stop fretting, everything's fine.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.485
The house looks incredible.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.365
So it should, the money I paid.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.965
£4,000 on the garden alone.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.205
I didn't know you'd had
anything done to the garden.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.925
Oh, good - that means I've won
the argument with your mother.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.125
She said you can tell
the difference, I say you can't.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.605
Why, what have you had done?

04:07.640 --> 04:10.445
Well, you know how much
I hate mowing that lawn.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.405
I splashed out and had
the whole thing replaced

04:12.440 --> 04:14.160
- with artificial grass.
- ENGINE STARTS

04:17.120 --> 04:19.285
They make some quite
convincing stuff these days.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.165
Exactly like the real thing,
but made of plastic.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.525
We were in two minds about it.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.325
You know, your mother likes
a natural lawn,

04:25.360 --> 04:27.245
but she doesn't have
to mow the bloody thing.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.005
So, in the end, I managed to...

04:29.040 --> 04:31.605
Hello? Hello, Lucy?

04:31.640 --> 04:32.965
Stop!

04:33.000 --> 04:34.960
I can't hear you, I'm mowing the lawn.

04:37.840 --> 04:38.925
ENGINE STOPS

04:38.960 --> 04:41.005
..cking idiot!

04:41.040 --> 04:43.165
I said stop the machine!

04:43.200 --> 04:45.880
- Why, do you want to have a go?
- Only if you lie down in front of it!

04:46.880 --> 04:48.560
- What?
- It's artificial grass.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.240
Ah...

05:03.920 --> 05:05.160
No!

05:06.720 --> 05:08.645
I think it's best if you don't speak.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.840
Can I sing?

05:10.960 --> 05:14.205
Sure. How about something
by Marvin Gaye?

05:14.240 --> 05:16.040
Oh, I get it - Mow-town.

05:17.240 --> 05:20.040
No, I mean because he was murdered
by a family member.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.445
Why would someone with artificial lawn

05:23.480 --> 05:25.805
- still have a lawnmower in the shed?
- I don't know.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.205
Maybe you can ask Dad that while

05:27.240 --> 05:29.765
he's ripping your spleen out
with a trowel.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.765
This isn't only my fault. You said
mowing the lawn was a good idea.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.645
- Because I didn't know it was fake.
- Well, neither did I.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.645
Well, why did you not check it was real?

05:37.680 --> 05:41.440
The same reason that I didn't check
that the house was made of Lego.

05:44.120 --> 05:47.885
Well, I just hope they can fit a new
one before Mum and Dad get back.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.005
What?

05:49.040 --> 05:51.645
I found the details of the lawn
company at Mum and Dad's house.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.125
I'm ordering a new one.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.765
We are not buying them a new lawn.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.005
Well, we've got to.
Dad spent a fortune on it.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.725
That is why we are not
buying them a new lawn.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.085
Well, what else can we do?

06:01.120 --> 06:03.125
Well, it was only
one small strip that we damaged.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.445
Perhaps we can replace it.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.725
Oh, what are we going to do,

06:05.760 --> 06:07.920
nick some from a table
outside the greengrocers?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.160
No!

06:12.040 --> 06:13.885
All right,
we're just brainstorming here.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.805
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.645
Oh, I know! Why don't we shave
50 hedgehogs,

06:18.680 --> 06:21.760
backfill the strip with their
bristles and cover it in guacamole?

06:23.400 --> 06:26.045
No matter how we patch it, Dad
is going to notice the difference.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.885
It has to be the whole lawn we replace.

06:28.920 --> 06:32.885
We can probably just about afford it
if we use our savings account.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.125
That money is for
our beach holiday in Alicante.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.285
Well, we'll just have
to improvise, then, won't we?

06:38.320 --> 06:41.565
We've got a sandpit
and a fridge full of paella.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.320
But we haven't got Europe's second
largest crazy golf course, have we?

06:46.600 --> 06:48.560
You know you said that out loud, right?

06:50.200 --> 06:53.040
How does this sound?
We say foxes did it.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.405
Foxes mowed the lawn.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.325
I'll tell you exactly how that sounds,

06:59.360 --> 07:01.320
like a John Lewis Christmas advert.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.165
All right, what about we rip
the whole thing out

07:07.200 --> 07:08.920
and say it got stolen?

07:10.800 --> 07:14.205
Who goes around stealing
other people's artificial lawns?

07:14.240 --> 07:16.525
Well, fair point.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.960
Most criminals stick to their own turf.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.085
One day, this will all be behind us
and everything will be solved,

07:25.120 --> 07:26.685
and perhaps then you will appreciate

07:26.720 --> 07:28.680
that that was actually
a very funny joke.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.925
I am phoning the lawn company.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.245
All right, I've got it! It's obvious.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.130
What?

07:36.166 --> 07:38.715
We finish the job and
mow the rest of the lawn.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.125
I know you're not stupid,

07:43.160 --> 07:46.045
and I know you are probably
actually following all of this,

07:46.080 --> 07:48.525
but just on the off chance you're not...

07:48.560 --> 07:51.040
..it's not a real lawn!

07:52.920 --> 07:56.045
I know it's not,
but we only took off this much.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.525
If we do the same
across the whole of the lawn,

07:58.560 --> 08:00.645
he'll never notice the difference.

08:00.680 --> 08:01.920
Of course he will.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.680
Won't he?

08:06.560 --> 08:08.765
Well, there's only one way to find out.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.205
And what have we got to lose?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.565
Sorry, is that rhetorical,

08:11.600 --> 08:14.080
or am I supposed to actually
start listing your body parts?

08:25.680 --> 08:28.680
Ah, the smell of
freshly cut polypropylene fibres.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.285
What do you reckon?

08:31.320 --> 08:33.284
I'm sure you can tell the difference.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.804
Well, I'm only part way through
mowing it. Don't judge me yet.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.684
We're only part way through
our marriage,

08:37.720 --> 08:39.405
but I've reached a judgment on that.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.760
Just keep watching.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.565
ENGINE SPLUTTERS

08:45.600 --> 08:47.120
Now can I start judging you?

08:50.880 --> 08:54.405
The fuel pipe's broken.
Petrol's spewing everywhere.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.085
Well, don't waste it, I need a drink.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.405
Don't worry, we can still do this.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.400
It just might take a little bit
longer than I first thought.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.205
You missed a bit.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.640
I hate you.

09:20.840 --> 09:24.205
Oh, Anna, thank you for waiting so late.

09:24.240 --> 09:27.245
No, no, it was a pleasure, Lucy.

09:27.280 --> 09:30.125
There was me thinking I was only
collecting them from school,

09:30.160 --> 09:33.165
so it was a real treat to be able
to bring them home and feed them

09:33.200 --> 09:37.485
and bathe them and pick up their wet
towels and make them a hot drink.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.245
And fight them to get them
to switch off the television.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.525
And then break up an argument
over a glass of Ribena,

09:43.560 --> 09:49.005
which resulted in me staining
my brand-new cashmere cardigan.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.005
I should be thanking you.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.565
Sorry.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.965
Well, at least I didn't have
to spend another evening

09:55.000 --> 09:59.125
listening to Toby talk about his
new Dreambuilder Excel 3D printer

09:59.160 --> 10:01.400
with its patented open-source software.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.480
It's like he's asking for a divorce.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.005
What on earth is that?

10:08.040 --> 10:10.245
Er, there's been an accident.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.800
We ran over a Muppet.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.485
- Well, I'd better get back home.
- Yeah.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.805
Toby will be thinking
you've run off and left him.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.960
Yeah, we don't want
him raising his hopes.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.880
Bye.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.965
You've got to admit, that lawn
looked pretty good by the end.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.245
Well, yeah, I suppose
I couldn't tell the difference,

10:30.280 --> 10:32.885
- but the question is, will Dad be able to?
- That depends.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.525
Is he the kind of person that
gets down on his knees to measure

10:35.560 --> 10:36.885
the blades of grass on his lawn?

10:36.920 --> 10:38.925
- Yes.
- I thought so.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.565
In that case, we're going
to have to kneecap him.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.725
It'll be fine, he won't notice.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.685
And what he doesn't know won't hurt him.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.085
You mean what he doesn't know
won't hurt you.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.445
Exactly.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.085
The lawn mower's still broken.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.605
But he won't need to use it again,
so he'll never find out.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.645
And the grass absolutely
stinks of petrol.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.965
Which will have faded
by the time they return.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.280
I'm telling you, it's the perfect
crime... unless somebody grasses.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.725
You're still not ready
for those, are you?

11:05.760 --> 11:07.685
And best of all, we do not have to ring

11:07.720 --> 11:10.205
the artificial lawn company
and spend a fortune.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.525
Don't you feel
even a tiny bit dishonest?

11:12.560 --> 11:13.885
I'll tell you what's dishonest -

11:13.920 --> 11:16.200
covering your garden in plastic
and saying it's a lawn.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.485
Well, I wouldn't let my dad hear
you saying that.

11:19.520 --> 11:22.045
- Ha, I'm not scared of your dad.
- PHONE RINGS

11:22.080 --> 11:24.205
Argh, it's your dad!

11:24.240 --> 11:26.565
- Oh, my God, he knows everything!
- But he doesn't!

11:26.600 --> 11:29.205
Just answer the phone and act casual.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.480
OK.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.245
HIGH-PITCHED: Hi, Dad!

11:33.280 --> 11:36.405
That's it, casual,
like you've been stabbed.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.165
Hello, Lucy, everything all right?

11:38.200 --> 11:39.325
Of course.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.925
You ended that earlier
phone call very abruptly.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.200
Well... you know...

11:45.680 --> 11:48.125
Brilliant, just like that.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.085
There's just something
I wanted to check.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.965
When you were round there,
did you go into the shed?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.405
The shed?

11:54.440 --> 11:55.805
No.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.245
Oh, that's odd...

11:57.280 --> 11:59.645
..because I've just had a message
from Colin the builder.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.645
Colin the builder?
Who's Colin the builder?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.800
Well, his name's Colin,
and he's a builder.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.080
Have you been drinking?

12:08.920 --> 12:11.365
He left some ladders at the house
and when he went round to

12:11.400 --> 12:14.205
collect them this evening,
he saw the shed door was open.

12:14.240 --> 12:19.040
Oh, well, you obviously left
the shed unlocked before you left.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.685
Maybe.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.920
Oh, what are you like,
you silly old sausage.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.525
Well, you've been very busy lately,
Dad, you've had a lot on your mind.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.885
Well, that's true.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.605
You must be losing your marbles.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.885
What's happening?

12:35.920 --> 12:38.560
Just tricking an old man
into thinking he's got dementia.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.885
Anyway, I'll find out exactly
what happened when we get back.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.485
Oh, and how will you do that?

12:44.520 --> 12:47.000
I'll check the recordings
on the CCTV camera.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.000
You've got CCTV?!

12:58.080 --> 13:00.285
Yes, I rigged it up
as part of the extension.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.165
I did wonder whether it
was worth the expense,

13:02.200 --> 13:04.440
but you never know
what you might see on them.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.005
Oh, I'm sure it's full of
all sorts of surprises.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.765
I've spent a lot of money on that
house, and if anything happens to

13:12.800 --> 13:16.880
it, I want the scumbags responsible
on camera so they can be punished.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.965
Bit harsh, Dad.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.720
They might be nice scumbags.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.525
Anyway, I've got to go, Dad.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.685
Night-night.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.845
Goodnight, darling.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.600
- What are we going to do?
- We could murder Colin the builder.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.564
How would that help?

13:33.600 --> 13:35.925
It wouldn't, but let's
just do it anyway.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.565
Well, don't blame anyone else for this,

13:37.600 --> 13:40.285
you're the one who forgot to lock
the shed, meaning Dad's going

13:40.320 --> 13:42.640
to check his cameras
and see you mowing the fake lawn.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.160
Do you think he'll be angry?

13:46.280 --> 13:48.245
No, I think he'll forget all
about that part,

13:48.280 --> 13:50.485
when he sees us creep back in
in the middle of the night

13:50.520 --> 13:52.200
and finish the job with craft scissors!

13:54.360 --> 13:56.325
What are we going to do?

13:56.360 --> 14:00.285
Maybe we can sort of hack into
the system and delete the footage.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.725
Hack into the CCTV system?

14:02.760 --> 14:05.400
Lucy, we don't even
know how to use the Sky+ Box.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.645
Well, we need help, then, don't we?

14:08.680 --> 14:11.725
And who do we know who's anal
and boring enough to understand

14:11.760 --> 14:14.405
the workings of an electronic
surveillance system?

14:14.440 --> 14:15.800
CCTV?

14:18.640 --> 14:20.125
Why do you want to know about that?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.485
Well, there's been some break-ins
in our area recently,

14:22.520 --> 14:24.285
so I thought if I got a camera
at the house...

14:24.320 --> 14:25.440
It gives you an alibi.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.245
So, come on,
how exactly do these things work?

14:30.280 --> 14:33.045
Well, basically, there's a central
hub housed in

14:33.080 --> 14:35.845
a secure location with
any number of peripheral nodes...

14:35.880 --> 14:39.445
Spare us the detail,
Stephen Hawking. How do you wipe it?

14:39.480 --> 14:41.045
- Wipe it?
- Yeah.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.440
With a damp cloth.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.405
I don't mean that.

14:46.440 --> 14:50.965
Look, let's say, for example,
that you had CCTV at your house,

14:51.000 --> 14:55.285
and say, for example,
that... Anna had...

14:55.320 --> 14:57.960
..sex with the postman in your garden.

14:59.320 --> 15:02.125
How would the postman erase that event?

15:02.160 --> 15:04.440
From the CCTV, or from his memory?

15:07.160 --> 15:10.205
From the CCTV,
but in a way that nobody knew.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.925
Impossible. That's the whole
point of having a security system -

15:12.960 --> 15:15.405
- they're tamper-proof.
- There must be something you can do.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.684
- There isn't.
- Are you sure?

15:16.720 --> 15:17.805
Completely positive.

15:17.840 --> 15:21.160
There's absolutely not
a single thing on earth you can do.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.720
- Unless...
- Talk to me.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.445
Unless you completely rip out the drive.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.664
I've already buggered his lawn -
I'm not going back for the drive.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.960
- What?
- Nothing, carry on.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.245
Well, I suppose you could follow
a wire back from one of the cameras,

15:38.280 --> 15:39.805
locate the hard drive box

15:39.840 --> 15:43.572
and then remove and replace it
with a blank brand-new substitute.

15:43.608 --> 15:45.325
And the owner would simply assume

15:45.360 --> 15:47.485
he hadn't set it properly
in the first place.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.005
Brilliant!

15:49.040 --> 15:51.680
So, come on, what's really going on?
What have you been up to?

15:52.680 --> 15:54.555
All right, I'll tell you,
but it's a bit embarrassing.

15:54.591 --> 15:55.680
Go on.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.780
I had sex with Anna in your garden.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.160
Well, that's OK - as long
as you didn't damage the lawn.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.265
Can I help you?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.625
Yes, I'd like to exchange this, please.

16:15.660 --> 16:17.145
Have you got the receipt?

16:17.280 --> 16:21.360
Well, I did have, but er,
it got chewed up... by my... rabbit.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.280
- What's the name?
- Dylan.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.525
- Your name.
- Oh. Um, Geoffrey Adams.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.280
Geoffrey Aloysius Adams.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.165
I know, I surprise myself sometimes.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.560
I don't really look like a...

16:39.640 --> 16:41.120
- Alion...
- Aloysius. - That's it.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.200
Postcode?

16:44.280 --> 16:46.925
Er, KT10 4BK.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.485
She keeps beating me to it.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.529
She's like this when
we're watching Countdown.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.677
House number?

16:52.713 --> 16:53.955
- 15.
- 17.

16:55.320 --> 16:56.605
15 to 17.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.920
It's a big house,
that's why we need security.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.685
Yeah, we've got you on here, Mr Adams.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.244
You're still within the exchange period.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.045
So, what's the problem with it?

17:07.079 --> 17:09.880
Um... It's the vertical contrast.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.244
It hasn't got the right
aspect ratio grading.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.960
I don't understand what that means.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.920
Huh, call yourself the expert.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.925
So what is the correct aspect
ratio grading?

17:24.960 --> 17:26.040
What?

17:27.359 --> 17:29.805
So if it's not
the right aspect ratio grading,

17:29.840 --> 17:32.205
what's the correct one?

17:32.240 --> 17:33.600
Six.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.005
Six what?

17:38.040 --> 17:39.160
Seven.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.325
- Look, I'm obviously confusing you.
- Yeah, you are.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.725
Well, to put it in layman's terms,
it's buggered.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.805
Are you sure you're not just
using it incorrectly?

17:49.840 --> 17:51.245
Are you saying I'm incompetent?

17:51.280 --> 17:53.085
Well, no, but, you know,

17:53.120 --> 17:56.040
we get some people in here who can't
even pronounce their own names.

17:58.120 --> 18:02.445
Can you just take it back, please?
I'd be very grateful...

18:02.480 --> 18:04.160
..Tekkram.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.320
That's the name of the shop.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.365
Fine, leave it with us for a week.
We'll see what we can do.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.725
A week? They're back
at three o'clock tomorrow.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.245
Who are?

18:19.280 --> 18:20.360
The burglars.

18:21.920 --> 18:25.565
I mean, thieving bastards,
but at least they're punctual.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.165
Can't you just exchange it?

18:27.200 --> 18:29.685
Your sign says you offer
a no-quibble exchange policy.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.805
- Yeah, but...
- That sounded like a quibble.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.565
- I'm just trying to point out...
- Quibble.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.280
- But the whole...
- Quibble...

18:43.360 --> 18:44.925
Thank you.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.040
- Say thank you, Aloysius.
- Thank you.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.765
Right, let's get back before
our irritating daughter

18:51.800 --> 18:53.165
wonders where we are.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.640
And let's not forget our twat
of a son-in-law.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.840
Result!

19:14.480 --> 19:16.480
Nothing but gardening on the TV
these days.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.760
I recognise you off the telly.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.285
You'd make a terrible burglar,
waving at the camera like that.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.285
Be like being robbed by the Teletubbies.

19:28.320 --> 19:32.120
- Is it working, then?
- Sure is. I could get a job with MI6.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.925
All right, Maplins.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.045
There's still a whiff of lawnmower fuel.

19:37.080 --> 19:40.685
Which is getting less, and it'll be
gone by the time your dad gets back.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.925
- Anything else you want to be paranoid about?
- Yeah.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.245
What if he lip-reads
the conversation we're having now.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.925
It's not turned on now. It's on standby.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.405
And it will remain that way
until your dad gets back.

19:50.440 --> 19:54.565
That way he will find it blank and
assume he didn't set it properly.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.165
It's the perfect crime.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.845
We're like Bonnie and Clyde.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.445
- They end up getting shot.
- All right, Thelma and Louise.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.645
- They drove off a cliff.
- All right, Chas and Dave!

20:03.680 --> 20:06.480
The point is, your dad will never
know what happened.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.165
All right, there's no need to gloat.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.045
What makes you think I'm gloating?

20:11.080 --> 20:13.125
I'm detecting a slight air of hubris.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.240
I don't care what brand they are.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.320
Well, I suppose this is the closest
you'll ever come to deserving one.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.285
Look at me, Geoffrey,
smoking one of your cigars.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.960
Oh, no, you can't can you?
Cos the CCTV's not switched on.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.080
I love it when a plan comes together.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.880
Ah...

20:53.040 --> 20:54.765
Well, I'm going to be honest...

20:54.800 --> 20:57.605
..I think your dad's going
to notice this.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.325
NUMBER DIALS

20:59.360 --> 21:01.365
Maybe you should burn
the house down as well,

21:01.400 --> 21:03.365
you know, so it all matches.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.080
Please don't mention matches.

21:06.720 --> 21:10.485
Oh, hello, I'd like to get a price
on a new artificial lawn, please...

21:10.520 --> 21:12.120
..to be fitted immediately.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.925
- Ask if we can pitch a tent on it.
- Why?

21:15.960 --> 21:18.725
Well, seeing as we're not going to
be playing crazy golf in Alicante,

21:18.760 --> 21:21.400
we're going to have to think
of other ideas for our holiday.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.485
Stop acting so nervously. Mum
and Dad will be here in a second.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.965
Four grand out of pocket

21:33.000 --> 21:36.325
and all because I selflessly offered
to look after the house for them.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.005
Yes, you certainly are the hero
of this story, Lee.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.845
KNOCK AT DOOR

21:40.880 --> 21:45.685
Right! Now, remember, the lawn looks
fine, the workmen did a great job,

21:45.720 --> 21:48.925
so when Mum and Dad walk through
that door, just act normal.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.720
And for God's sake, don't shave them
or set fire to them.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.685
Hi, Mum. Where's Dad?

21:55.720 --> 21:58.165
I've got a bone to pick with you two.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.560
It was Lucy.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.645
Well, it was very sweet of her.

22:02.680 --> 22:03.845
What was?

22:03.880 --> 22:06.445
The bouquet of flowers
you left in the kitchen for us -

22:06.480 --> 22:07.845
you shouldn't have!

22:07.880 --> 22:10.925
We should be bringing gifts to you -
the house looks wonderful.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.085
Ah, see, I said you could trust us.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.125
It was your dad who was worried -
not me.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.965
It's not as if you're a pair of
teenagers having wild parties

22:18.000 --> 22:19.325
and taking drugs.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.085
Exactly.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.520
Although there was
a little bit of smoking grass.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.565
So, where's Geoffrey?

22:27.600 --> 22:29.285
Getting frustrated with the CCTV.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.765
It didn't record a thing
while we were away!

22:31.800 --> 22:35.205
Oh, what a shame.
He must have left it on standby.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.885
- Not that I understand these things.
- Me neither.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.485
I wouldn't even know how to plug one in,

22:39.520 --> 22:41.120
never mind replace the whole system.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.725
Well, it's certainly put him
in a bad mood,

22:44.760 --> 22:46.520
what, with that and the lawn.

22:47.285 --> 22:48.610
Why, what's up with the lawn?

22:48.646 --> 22:51.325
Oh, there's nothing wrong with it,
I just convinced Geoffrey

22:51.360 --> 22:54.525
while we were away that artificial
lawn doesn't look real.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.400
Oh, trust me, it looks real.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.525
So, he's come round
to my way of thinking.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.120
We're having the whole thing
ripped up and re-turfed.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.485
CHILDREN YELL

23:07.520 --> 23:09.959
I'll pop up and say hello
to the children.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.800
Well, that was a waste of £4,000.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.800
- Could this actually get any worse?
- Yeah.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.125
If they're going back to real grass,

23:19.160 --> 23:21.000
we should really buy him
a new lawnmower.

23:22.840 --> 23:25.045
Look, it's not a complete
waste of money, is it?

23:25.080 --> 23:27.405
The whole point of all this was
so that Dad didn't find out

23:27.440 --> 23:29.325
what you did and think you're an idiot.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.765
- And he hasn't, has he?
- I suppose.

23:31.800 --> 23:35.160
So you may have lost your holiday,
but at least you kept your dignity.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.845
Yes?

23:42.880 --> 23:46.125
It's this CCTV unit.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.885
I set it to record for a week
and the whole thing is blank.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.605
Are you sure you set it correctly?

23:50.640 --> 23:52.400
Are you saying I'm incompetent?

23:54.400 --> 23:55.885
What's wrong with this one?

23:55.920 --> 23:57.645
Vertical contrast?

23:57.681 --> 23:59.972
Aspect ratio grading?

24:00.480 --> 24:01.685
What?

24:01.720 --> 24:03.685
Just some idiot we had in here yesterday

24:03.720 --> 24:05.205
with exactly the same model.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.845
We tested the thing, turns out
there's nothing wrong with it.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.040
Look.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.080
Good God!

24:28.360 --> 24:30.005
Look, it's fine.

24:30.040 --> 24:32.925
I explained to Dad that we spent
all our money trying to make amends.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.925
The CCTV is up and running again,

24:34.960 --> 24:37.485
and I told him we're replacing
the lawnmower.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.165
We're back where we started.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.485
Yeah. But he stills thinks I'm an
absolute idiot who can't perform

24:42.520 --> 24:45.725
a simple task without messing up
like a pillock.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.040
Like I said,
we're back where we started.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.885
Your dad's never going to let me
forget this, is he?

24:51.920 --> 24:53.405
Of course he will.

24:53.440 --> 24:56.605
He's promised he'll never
mention it again. To anyone.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.200

whole thing into a West End musical.
