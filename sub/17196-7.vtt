00:18.685 --> 00:21.787
(male announcer)
previously on <i>gracepoint...</i>

00:21.789 --> 00:23.222
(emmett)
they're panicking,
starting to show themselves.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.456
<i>That's exactly what we want.</i>

00:24.458 --> 00:25.724
(ellie)
our burned boat,

00:25.726 --> 00:28.293
It belonged
to my brother-in-law.

00:28.295 --> 00:29.528
Who knew it was there?

00:29.530 --> 00:31.463
I don't want
anything to do with you.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.732
I know men who'd rape you.

00:33.734 --> 00:34.733
You have any kids?
Daughter.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.402
17, lives with her mother.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.203
This is dad.
Please try me.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.571
You're the detective's kid.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.373
Come and knock on my door
sometime.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.574
Found this.

00:42.576 --> 00:43.642
That's danny's phone.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.877
Forensics get anything
off it?

00:44.879 --> 00:47.246
No data, no texts,
no call log.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.815
I know about you
and gemma fisher.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.250
I saw him with someone.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.918
With who?
Backpacker.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.753
Lars pierson.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.156
His cell number was found
in the lining of danny's jacket.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.891
Pointing the finger
at an innocent man.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.225
That's not the version
we submitted.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.061
What are you doing
to protect jack reinhold?

01:02.063 --> 01:04.063
You're asking for help,
but you won't talk to us.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.331
Vince is rounding up
a lynch mob.

01:40.633 --> 01:43.102
[knocking at the door]

01:44.571 --> 01:48.740
They're scum,
the bunch of 'em.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.609
They hounded
that poor man to death,

01:50.611 --> 01:55.214
And now they're
playing innocent.

01:55.216 --> 01:58.550
If you're coming,
you'll need a black one.

02:00.286 --> 02:03.789
County supervisor's
cutting our budget.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.257
What?

02:05.259 --> 02:06.892
Starting next week.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.261
He's pulling staff support,
forensic requests.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.796
He can't do that.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.898
That's what happens
when a case drags on.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.801
Bosses lose confidence,
panic about accounting.

02:15.803 --> 02:19.071
But we can't pull back.
Pierson's still out there.

02:19.073 --> 02:21.940
C.S.I.'s combing the property
out at the harvey ridge hut.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.842
We're still looking over--
get it done this week.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.811
Drag everyone in.

02:25.813 --> 02:29.348
Rack up overtime
before he pulls the rug out.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.150
Know what might help?

02:31.152 --> 02:34.920
Nailing whoever vandalized
jack reinhold's shop.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.955
Might win us brownie points.

02:36.957 --> 02:40.859
You know, you don't
have to come to the funeral.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.762
'cause of this?

02:43.764 --> 02:46.031
Screw 'em.

02:46.033 --> 02:49.268
You think they're right?
Worst cop in california?

02:50.637 --> 02:53.272
Maybe top ten.

02:55.642 --> 02:59.044
Danny's killer could
easily be there.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.712
With another death
on their conscience,

03:00.714 --> 03:03.282
Let's see who's
looking worried.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.951
Doesn't seem right.
Burying jack,

03:05.953 --> 03:08.520
And they still won't let us
have danny's body.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.556
Well, they have to find
the killer first.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.091
Can we not do this
right now?

03:17.797 --> 03:20.732
You know,
I-I've been thinking,

03:20.734 --> 03:23.535
Maybe I should
start working again.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.404
When?

03:25.406 --> 03:28.040
I don't know.
Next week maybe.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.042
I mean, vince can't carry
the business forever,

03:30.044 --> 03:31.476
And we need the money.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.213
If you want me to stay home,
I can--

03:34.215 --> 03:35.647
No, no, no, no.
You are probably right.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.049
We need the money.

03:37.051 --> 03:40.852
I will find something
to do here alone.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.354
You could go back
to the visitor's center.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.855
[sighs]

03:43.857 --> 03:45.591
Get direction
from the dead boy's mom--

03:45.593 --> 03:46.592
That'll pack 'em into town.
I'll be fine.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.593
[footsteps approaching]

03:47.595 --> 03:48.694
Nope, no way.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.696
I said, "black."

03:50.698 --> 03:51.930
I didn't even like him.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.665
Change.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.167
[sighs]

04:12.018 --> 04:16.455

05:11.078 --> 05:15.113
We are assembled here today
to share our grief

05:15.115 --> 05:19.251
And to celebrate the life
of jack curtis reinhold.

05:19.253 --> 05:22.154
<i>Blessed are those who mourn,</i>
<i>for they will be comforted.</i>

05:22.156 --> 05:25.524
<i>Jack reinhold was a good man.</i>

05:25.526 --> 05:28.160
As we've learned,
since his death,

05:28.162 --> 05:30.262
An innocent man.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.664
<i>He owned a local business.</i>

05:32.666 --> 05:34.833
He was a part
of our community.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.704
<i>He taught our children</i>
<i>to notice and value</i>

05:38.706 --> 05:41.673
<i>The natural world,</i>
<i>and to work to preserve it.</i>

05:41.675 --> 05:45.210
So how are we here?

05:45.212 --> 05:48.180
Why did this happen?

05:48.182 --> 05:51.883
<i>Because we let him</i>
<i>be smeared and intimidated.</i>

05:51.885 --> 05:57.189
We were absent
when he needed us.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.191
We failed him,

05:59.193 --> 06:06.465
<i>Just as we failed and</i>
<i>continue to fail danny solano.</i>

06:09.736 --> 06:11.370
(gemma)
so well done, you.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.705
You managed to give us all
a good tongue lashing.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.807
What did you just say
to the town priest?

06:15.809 --> 06:16.808
What, tongue lashing?

06:16.810 --> 06:17.843
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

06:17.845 --> 06:18.877
[both laughing]

06:18.879 --> 06:21.146
Seriously,
you did jack proud.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.715
<i>Mm, you too.</i>
<i>Holding his wake here--</i>

06:23.717 --> 06:25.217
It's very christian
of you.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.885
Yeah, it's funny,
seeing as I'm a wiccan.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.053
[laughs]

06:28.055 --> 06:31.189
Hi.
It's good to see you both.

06:31.191 --> 06:34.393
I'll have a white wine, and
a beer for my husband please.

06:34.395 --> 06:37.229
Yeah, yeah.
[clears throat]

06:37.231 --> 06:39.731
Seems like half of gracepoint
is here.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.667
Keep an eye on everyone.
Eye on everyone.

06:42.669 --> 06:46.671
Tell you if I see anything
suspicious--got it.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.740
I've taught you well.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.611
Yes, I knew nothing before
you came into my life.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.879
(gemma)
here you go.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.947
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.620
Hey.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.088
I don't know
what beth told you,

07:03.090 --> 07:05.223
But we're not going
for that memorial service.

07:05.225 --> 07:08.393
When all this is over, we're
gonna have a real funeral, okay?

07:08.395 --> 07:09.428
If your mind's made up.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.762
It is.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.063
Understood.
Whatever you want, mark,

07:12.065 --> 07:13.565
I'll be there.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.635
Well, I'll tell you
if I want you there.

07:18.204 --> 07:20.539
It was a nice lecture...

07:20.541 --> 07:22.808
And a veiled message to me.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.443
Not veiled at all.

07:24.445 --> 07:27.412
I came to you, I told you
jack needed protection.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.647
You did nothing.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.302
Hi.
Hi.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.971
I never heard back from you
on susan wright.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.640
I had frank look into her.
Nothing got flagged.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.476
You didn't handle it?

07:57.478 --> 08:00.145
I was hoping I'd get
your personal attention.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.247
<i>(ellie)</i>
<i>my personal attention?</i>

08:02.249 --> 08:04.649
[chuckles]

08:04.651 --> 08:05.984
Is that funny?

08:05.986 --> 08:08.453
Kathy, can we talk
about this later?

08:08.455 --> 08:11.323
Now is not the time,
really.

08:12.492 --> 08:16.061
[sighs]

08:20.867 --> 08:23.869
[disturbing music and effects]

08:23.871 --> 08:31.943

08:34.514 --> 08:35.680
[object smashes]
(man)
oh!

08:35.682 --> 08:37.148
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.584
A few too many, buddy, huh?
I'm fine.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.163
You doing all right
there, tom?

08:52.165 --> 08:54.466
This must be
a hard day for ya.

08:54.468 --> 08:57.269
It's okay.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.007
Is that paul I saw you with?

09:02.009 --> 09:03.909
Yeah.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.278
You get along with him?

09:08.047 --> 09:10.048
Did danny get along with him?

09:10.050 --> 09:12.584
I guess.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.554
They ever...

09:15.556 --> 09:17.889
Talk in private,
meet outside of Sunday school?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.791
<i>(joe)</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

09:20.893 --> 09:22.127
You all right?

09:23.729 --> 09:25.463
Hey, why don't you
go find mom?

09:30.436 --> 09:32.904
You want to talk to my son,
you come to me first.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.541
I saw the priest
put his hand on his leg.

09:36.543 --> 09:39.744
They were sitting here alone,
so I thought I'd check on him.

09:39.746 --> 09:43.048
Did you not hear what paul
talked about in church?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.417
You assume the worst in people
at every single moment.

09:45.419 --> 09:49.120
Sometimes I'm right.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.122
You could show
some gratitude

09:51.124 --> 09:52.924
That I'm concerned
about your boy.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.759
You're a disturbed person.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.728
I'd feel sorry for you,
if you weren't making

09:56.730 --> 09:59.731
Everyone in this town
so miserable...

09:59.733 --> 10:02.601
Especially my wife.

10:04.770 --> 10:08.273
Hey, buddy,
you doing okay?

10:08.275 --> 10:10.809
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

10:10.811 --> 10:14.446
Well, there are a lot of people
in this room who love you.

10:14.448 --> 10:18.316
Look, I know all this must be
really tough on you,

10:18.318 --> 10:21.119
Being at a funeral.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.488
Does it make you
think of danny?

10:23.490 --> 10:25.890
You miss him pretty bad?

10:25.892 --> 10:28.259
Of course I miss him.
Why wouldn't I?

10:28.261 --> 10:30.295
Tom, why are you--

10:30.297 --> 10:33.164
You don't even know
anything about me anymore.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.124
You want me to carry that
for you?

10:59.126 --> 11:01.292
No, thanks.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.460
<i>(dylan)</i>

Pongo!

11:06.332 --> 11:11.302
Ugh, crap.
Uh...7:58.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.004
Uh, all right, hold on.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.305
I can go alone.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.306
<i>Pongo.</i>
<i>No, stay with your brother.</i>

11:15.308 --> 11:16.474
Daddy's getting him.

11:16.476 --> 11:19.644
Dad, take him.
I'm fine.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.614
You need to stop
worrying.

11:22.616 --> 11:24.149
It's three blocks.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.985
Uh...Okay.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.486
All right, give me a kiss.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.989
Bye.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.490
Have a good day.

11:32.492 --> 11:36.394
[children chattering]

11:36.396 --> 11:38.463
Okay, buddy.

11:40.232 --> 11:41.666
[knocking at the door]

11:41.668 --> 11:45.537
You know what I decided?
No more newspapers.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.206
You and I are done reading them
till we close this case,

11:48.208 --> 11:52.744
Not online, not in print.
It isn't healthy.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.214
<i>You with me?</i>

11:56.216 --> 11:58.717
Just nod.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.652
Close enough.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.354
So what's up?

12:03.356 --> 12:07.859
I finally got some information
from danny's cell carrier.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.694
Turns out danny's flip phone
was set to forward

12:09.696 --> 12:11.529
All calls to another number.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.598
That number has to be
his smartphone,

12:13.600 --> 12:15.600
But it's switched off,
so we can't trace it.

12:15.602 --> 12:16.768
Can we get someone to--
already done.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.269
If that phone ever
gets switched on,

12:18.271 --> 12:20.538
We'll know about it.
Oh, and question for you--

12:20.540 --> 12:24.109
Did you know that the priest
went to high school

12:24.111 --> 12:25.710
With beth and mark solano?

12:25.712 --> 12:27.846
Paul coates?
Yeah.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.913
Different years though.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.249
Beth and paul were
class of 2000.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.617
Mark was class of '99.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.220
Sounds about right.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.921
And you didn't bother
to mention this?

12:36.923 --> 12:39.758
Well, I told you
he grew up here.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.059
Where'd you think he went?
[knocking at the door]

12:41.061 --> 12:43.094
Sorry.
Call for you, detective miller.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.562
Tom's school.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.698
All right, just put it
through to my desk,

12:46.700 --> 12:47.699
Please, tammy.
Sure.

12:47.701 --> 12:48.700
Thank you.

12:48.702 --> 12:51.269
This is ellie.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.939
Oh, hi, carol.
He's not sick, is he?

12:54.941 --> 12:58.009
But joe walked him
to school this morning.

13:02.148 --> 13:03.615
Are you sure?

13:03.617 --> 13:05.717
I left him three blocks away.
He had his bike.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.585
What time?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.154
<i>(joe)</i>
<i>right before 8:00,</i>
<i>a couple minutes.</i>

13:09.156 --> 13:10.488
There were other parents around.
There were lots of kids.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.257
Oh, god, joe.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.258
<i>(joe)</i>
<i>should I meet you</i>
<i>at the school?</i>

13:13.260 --> 13:15.326
No. Go find him.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.095
(joe)
I will, I am.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.497
I shouldn't have left him alone.
I'm sorry.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.169
El, I know
what you're thinking.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.770
This isn't what happened
to danny.

13:25.772 --> 13:28.673
How can we know that?

13:28.675 --> 13:31.276
Of course that's
what I'm thinking.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.277
[tapping on window]

13:32.279 --> 13:35.346
I'm coming with you.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.952
His bike isn't outside.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.588
Did anyone see him this morning?
Noah, or--

13:43.590 --> 13:45.590
I haven't said anything
to the kids.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.091
We don't want to alarm them,
if that's avoidable.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.326
It might not be.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.327
You should give her
some names.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.328
Noah, and who else?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.529
Evan, henry.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.364
And we should talk
to his teacher,

13:53.366 --> 13:54.999
See if there's any reason
tom might have wanted to skip.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.635
A quiz, or a test,
or trouble with a classmate.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.470
He--he didn't mention
anything.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.973
Mr. Conroy is out today.
His wife called last minute.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.341
Is he sick?

14:03.343 --> 14:04.642
She just said
he couldn't make it.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.045
I tried to ask why,
but she hung up.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.981
It's your call.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.350
You want to talk to the kids,
or find the teacher?

14:13.652 --> 14:16.287
Hey, buddy,
you got to give me a call.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.989
I'm not gonna be mad,
I just--

14:17.991 --> 14:22.894
Just need to know where you are,
so call me back, please.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.468
Tommy!

14:30.470 --> 14:32.704
Tommy!

14:32.706 --> 14:35.039
You haven't heard anything?

14:35.041 --> 14:37.242
<i>Did you see him</i>
<i>on his bike today?</i>

14:46.151 --> 14:47.952
Tom!

14:48.888 --> 14:49.888
[sighs]

14:49.890 --> 14:52.323
Anything?
No.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.158
What's he like,
this conroy?

14:54.160 --> 14:56.828
Quiet, better with kids
than with grown-ups.

14:56.830 --> 14:58.596
Neighbors aren't home
either.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.165
Want me to wait here,
see who shows?

15:10.709 --> 15:15.680
Triple fudge.
These are my favorite.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.382
Did you say something?

15:17.384 --> 15:20.952
You're gonna like
this new mix.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.755
They're not for me.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.876
Someone must have seen him.
How many kids pass that corner?

15:44.878 --> 15:47.045
We've got officers asking.
So far, no one.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.114
Could he have left on his own?
Do you think tom ran away?

15:50.116 --> 15:53.718
Detective miller doesn't think
he would do that.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.720
Well, he did seem pretty upset
at jack's funeral.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.455
Well, a lot of people
were upset.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.224
Mr. Conroy was
on the list you gave us.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.592
He didn't show up
for work today.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.795
Can you say why
you put his name down?

16:03.797 --> 16:04.796
<i>(beth)</i>
<i>you don't think he--</i>

16:04.798 --> 16:06.397
We don't know.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.933
Was there a reason
you included him?

16:08.935 --> 16:10.234
I did.
Beth didn't want to.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.737
[scoffs]
we talked about this.

16:12.739 --> 16:16.007
He was a male teacher.
Danny had only had females.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.642
He found it strange
at first.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.944
Found "it" strange or him?

16:19.946 --> 16:21.446
Well, both actually.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.482
But you said
you ruled him out.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.785
Every teacher at gracepoint
had a solid alibi

16:27.787 --> 16:30.355
For the night
of danny's murder.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.490
Conroy's wife told us
he was home with her.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.025
We had no reason
not to trust her.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.460
And now you can't find him.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.363
We can't find
either one of them.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.947
<i>(chief morgan)</i>
<i>at the moment, we have</i>
<i>no definite indication</i>

16:55.949 --> 16:57.815
<i>That tom miller's</i>
<i>disappearance</i>

16:57.817 --> 17:00.651
Is connected
to danny solano's death.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.821
For now, we've shifted our focus
to locating tom.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.791
We have officers searching
the immediate area.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.394
Members of the community
have also volunteered to help.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.129
What are you doing
to protect other children?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.730
<i>(reporter)</i>
<i>school gets out</i>
<i>in three hours.</i>

17:12.732 --> 17:14.332
We're coordinating
with principal atkins,

17:14.334 --> 17:17.035
As well as principal reaser
at the high school.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.337
We're advising parents
to pick up their children,

17:19.339 --> 17:20.505
Or send another adult.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.206
[all asking questions]

17:22.208 --> 17:25.910
I would emphasize again that
this is strictly a precaution.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.645
We're not at all certain
that what we're dealing with

17:27.647 --> 17:30.214
Is a second abduction.
In the green.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.216
Will detective miller
be taking time off?

17:32.218 --> 17:33.651
That's gonna be
up to detective miller.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.253
What about
detective carver,

17:35.255 --> 17:37.055

<i>on the solano case,</i>

<i>(chief morgan)</i>
<i>mr. Reinhold committed suicide.</i>

17:40.693 --> 17:43.061
His death had nothing to do
with detective carver

17:43.063 --> 17:44.896
Or any member
of this department,

17:44.898 --> 17:47.331

<i>is uniquely positioned</i>

17:49.536 --> 17:51.102
<i>To lead the search</i>

17:51.104 --> 17:52.670
You said they're aren't
connected.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.672
I said we don't know
if they're connected.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.240
That's it for now.
We'll keep you posted

17:56.242 --> 17:57.542
On significant developments.

17:57.544 --> 17:58.910
[crowd murmuring]
that's it.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.778

(chief morgan)
no, I'm sorry.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.748
(male reporter)
come on, chief, one more.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.354
This is not your fault.

18:10.356 --> 18:11.622
We're gonna find him.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.723
How do you know that?

18:12.725 --> 18:14.392
How could you possibly
know that?

18:14.394 --> 18:17.295
We have no idea
where he is, and--

18:17.297 --> 18:19.230
No, go ahead,
finish your thought--

18:19.232 --> 18:21.032
"thanks to me."

18:21.034 --> 18:22.533
I didn't say that.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.135
You didn't have to.

18:24.137 --> 18:29.807
Joe, we agreed that you would
walk him to school and back,

18:29.809 --> 18:31.876
That we would always know
where he was.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.578
Yeah, I knew
where he was.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.580
He was three blocks from school,
headed in that direction.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.148
But he never got there!

18:42.921 --> 18:46.491
Mark's organized a search team,
and you should go and join them.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.459
Owen's coming to watch dylan.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.228
Let me take him with me
in the backpack.

18:51.430 --> 18:54.332
What?
You don't want me to?

18:54.334 --> 18:56.834
Owen's coming.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.609
Owen.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.177
Hey.
Hey.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.079
You doing okay?

19:08.081 --> 19:09.614
Not great, no.

Come back when you're ready.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.091
Come back?

19:20.093 --> 19:21.759
Thought you were done
with me.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.494
Are you done
with renee clemons?

19:23.496 --> 19:26.130
[laughs]

19:26.132 --> 19:28.432
She ran away as soon as
they found jack, so--

19:28.434 --> 19:30.668
Understandable.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.603
Predictable.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.139
I'm really sorry, kathy.

19:35.141 --> 19:38.843
Give my love to your family.

tracked down fred's family?

21:04.963 --> 21:08.432
Do you mean the trailer park?
Ma, did a woman come here?

21:08.434 --> 21:12.169
From the park, that's right.
She was looking for you.

21:14.573 --> 21:17.441
Is that blood on your face?

21:17.443 --> 21:20.611
I-I went hunting
earlier this morning.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.547
She says you're
in trouble, vincent.

21:23.549 --> 21:26.450
Give me those.
Don't touch these.

All right?
You understand?

21:34.327 --> 21:37.028

put in it.

21:38.730 --> 21:41.299

Not cut 'em back!

21:42.835 --> 21:44.802

We need ten!

21:44.804 --> 21:46.937
We need two full staffs,
around the clock,

21:46.939 --> 21:50.474
One working danny's case,
the other searching for tom.

21:50.476 --> 21:53.144
What?

21:53.146 --> 21:56.847
I think you should consider
stepping down.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.349
Excuse me?

21:58.351 --> 22:00.451
It's happening
all over again.

22:00.453 --> 22:03.287
You came to gracepoint
to put rosemont behind you.

22:03.289 --> 22:04.822
Instead,
it followed you here.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.024
You just said it in front
of a hundred people--

22:07.026 --> 22:09.593
There is absolutely no evidence
that danny's death

22:09.595 --> 22:10.828
And tom's disappearance--

22:10.830 --> 22:12.363
I still think
it might be best.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.364
Forget it!

22:21.207 --> 22:23.374
So answer the door!

22:23.376 --> 22:25.176
And don't call me emmett.

Detective carver,
sorry to bother you.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.379
You don't look sorry.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.214
I was trying you on your
office phone with no luck.

22:30.216 --> 22:32.049
Because I'm here,
because I'm busy.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.284

22:35.721 --> 22:37.922
Hi, dad.

Okay, so nap around 2:00, and
put in a video if you need to.

Yeah, we're fine.
Just go.

23:14.761 --> 23:17.728
Looking for tom miller
and his blue and black--

23:17.730 --> 23:18.896
Yeah.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.598
Blue and black
mountain bike.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.199
<i>(mark)</i>
<i>thanks a lot</i>
<i>for turning out.</i>

23:22.201 --> 23:24.335
Let's go find
joe and ellie's boy, okay?

23:36.214 --> 23:38.749
<i>(julianne)</i>
<i>I came down main street</i>
<i>from the bus station.</i>

23:38.751 --> 23:41.619
This town is seriously tiny.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.953
What, do, like,
eight people live here?

23:42.955 --> 23:44.688
You walked from the station
on your own?

23:44.690 --> 23:46.123
I'm 17.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.792
I know.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.127
And what's with all the whales?
They're everywhere,

23:50.129 --> 23:52.296
On the street signs and mugs.

23:52.298 --> 23:53.297
What's up, julie?

23:53.299 --> 23:54.698
Julianne.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.434
Can you please tell me
why you're here?

23:56.436 --> 23:57.468
What happened to school?

23:57.470 --> 23:58.803
Staff enrichment day.

23:58.805 --> 23:59.804
Does mom know
where you are?

23:59.806 --> 24:01.539
Yes, she knows.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.974
God, for some reason, I thought
you'd be happy to see me.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.644
You left that
pathetic sounding message.

24:06.646 --> 24:07.912
I am happy to see you.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.814
But?

24:09.816 --> 24:12.983
This isn't an ordinary day.
We've got a missing child,

24:12.985 --> 24:14.885
A 12-year-old boy,
and the more time--

24:14.887 --> 24:16.821
<i>(ellie)</i>
<i>fred conroy's mother</i>
<i>had a stroke,</i>

24:16.823 --> 24:19.590
So he's been in eureka county
hospital since late last night.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.759
Miller--
another dead end.

24:21.761 --> 24:22.927
Um...

24:22.929 --> 24:24.495
Oh, hello.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.564
I-I'll wait outside.

24:26.566 --> 24:30.000
Yeah, there's a kitchen, snacks.
Is this your daughter?

24:30.002 --> 24:31.802
She is.
She--yeah.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.571
I'm julianne.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.806
I'm ellie miller.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.174
Hi.
<i>(emmett)</i>
<i>she's just gonna wait</i>

24:37.176 --> 24:38.509
In the kitchen.
[phone ringing]

24:38.511 --> 24:40.511
Excuse me.

24:40.513 --> 24:42.947
<i>Detective carver.</i>

24:42.949 --> 24:46.250
My dad said there's
another kid missing.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.118
There is.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.253
<i>(emmett)</i>
<i>keep him there, wait for me.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

24:49.255 --> 24:50.855
[hangs up phone]

24:50.857 --> 24:53.324
Your backpacker's come home.
They're got pierson.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.095
Stay here.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.108
<i>(emmett)</i>
<i>gracepoint p.D.</i>

25:11.110 --> 25:12.510
Detective carver, this--
hey,

25:12.512 --> 25:14.378
That is a potential
piece of evidence.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.680
Do not contaminate it.
Put your gloves on.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.382
I want this area
secured properly.

25:18.384 --> 25:21.151
Get on your radio,
and get every off-duty officer

25:21.153 --> 25:23.754
In the county down here,
now!

25:25.290 --> 25:27.358
I'd do whatever she wants
if I were you.

25:45.410 --> 25:49.880
His service pistol,
shotgun, two rifles.

25:49.882 --> 25:53.417
We're tracing them now
to see where he got them all.

25:53.419 --> 25:54.852
And we found this.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.086
What is it?

25:56.088 --> 25:59.557
Risperidone,
8 milligrams, antipsychotic.

25:59.559 --> 26:01.659
We haven't counted
the pills yet, but

26:01.661 --> 26:05.663
<i>It looks he hasn't taken any</i>
<i>in the last six months or so.</i>

26:05.665 --> 26:06.931
When can we talk to him?

26:06.933 --> 26:08.365
Waived his rights.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.733
Said he just wanted
something to eat,

26:09.735 --> 26:11.101
So we got him a burger.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.670
Yeah, I saw that.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.672
Why didn't you offer him
a milkshake too?

26:14.674 --> 26:17.274
Given you're dealing
with a missing child,

26:17.276 --> 26:19.009
Sheriff said you could
talk to him first.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.277
All right, let's do it.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.080
In gracepoint, properly.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.415
I'll take him back.
You stay here,

26:24.417 --> 26:25.416
Search the property.

26:25.418 --> 26:26.584
Absolutely not.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.419
I'm gonna be in that room.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.753
Wouldn't be appropriate.

26:34.225 --> 26:37.728
Okay, but you need
to keep your mouth shut.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.830
Let's go.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.341
You've never seen this boy?

27:24.343 --> 27:27.745
Um...

27:27.747 --> 27:31.348
I don't--I don't--
I don't know.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.517
They never brought me
my fries.

27:33.519 --> 27:34.852
Excuse me?

27:34.854 --> 27:36.587
With my hamburger.

27:36.589 --> 27:39.023
They never brought me
my fries.

27:39.025 --> 27:42.359
Can you tell me
about the untouched medication

27:42.361 --> 27:44.028
At your home?

27:44.030 --> 27:47.297
I don't like it.
I like to walk instead.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.466
Are you aware
that it's an antipsychotic?

27:49.468 --> 27:51.268
Yeah, I have heard that.

27:51.270 --> 27:54.538
It's also sometimes used for
post traumatic stress disorder.

27:54.540 --> 27:55.873
Okay.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.509
Did you know that?

27:58.511 --> 28:00.377
Why?
You want to borrow some?

28:00.379 --> 28:02.713
What does that mean?

28:02.715 --> 28:04.348
Sir, can we
just please--

28:04.350 --> 28:06.550
You look stressed,
and she looks traumatized.

28:06.552 --> 28:07.551
<i>(emmett)</i>
<i>yeah, all right.</i>

28:07.553 --> 28:09.687
You feeling traumatized?

28:09.689 --> 28:11.955
You feel it
through your body?

28:11.957 --> 28:13.657
You don't like that feeling?

28:13.659 --> 28:15.025
(emmett)
look at the picture again--

28:15.027 --> 28:17.127
I don't like that feeling
either.

28:17.129 --> 28:18.462
Nobody likes that feeling.

28:18.464 --> 28:19.897
<i>(emmett)</i>
<i>look at the picture!</i>

28:19.899 --> 28:21.965
<i>Have you seen this boy?</i>

28:24.736 --> 28:27.371
You were uncomfortable looking
at this boy a minute ago.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.639
Why?

28:28.641 --> 28:31.041
[sniffs]
I wasn't uncomfortable.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.377
I was hungry.

28:36.147 --> 28:38.916
He's a good-looking boy.

28:38.918 --> 28:42.219
Answer...The question!

28:42.221 --> 28:44.588
Have...You...Seen

28:44.590 --> 28:45.989
That child?

28:45.991 --> 28:47.257
He disappeared today,

28:47.259 --> 28:49.560
The same day
you returned to town.

28:49.562 --> 28:53.197
Your phone number was found
on the body of another boy

28:53.199 --> 28:55.899
Who was murdered
six weeks ago!

28:55.901 --> 28:59.336
Have...You seen...
This child?

28:59.338 --> 29:01.338
He's a good-looking boy.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.946
He looks just like you.

29:08.948 --> 29:11.415
If you have done
anything to my son,

29:11.417 --> 29:13.450
I will hurt you!
Hey, hey, hey.

29:13.452 --> 29:14.785
I will punish you...
Hey, I will deal with him.

29:14.787 --> 29:16.253
I will deal with him, come on.
In a way

29:16.255 --> 29:19.123
That you will never forget!
Come on, come on.

29:20.191 --> 29:21.825
[door slams shut]

29:32.704 --> 29:36.440
[dog barking]

29:36.442 --> 29:39.476
I had a feeling
you'd turn up today.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.044
Stay away from my mother.

29:41.046 --> 29:43.413
Your mother?
[dog barking]

29:43.415 --> 29:45.549
She's farther gone
than I thought.

29:45.551 --> 29:46.817
[dog barking]

29:46.819 --> 29:50.154
Makes things simpler
in some ways.

29:50.156 --> 29:53.190
Me, you can't fool
so easily.

29:54.492 --> 29:56.126
I want you out of our lives.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.496
What is that?
Money?

29:59.498 --> 30:01.498
Don't be stupid.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.966
Take it.

30:02.968 --> 30:06.637
You aren't thinking
straight, vincent.

30:06.639 --> 30:08.505
I know what you did.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.909
You need to talk to me,
tell me everything.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.343
[gasps]
shut up!

30:13.345 --> 30:15.512
[dog continues barking]

30:15.514 --> 30:18.015
You take this money, and you
get the hell out of gracepoint!

30:18.017 --> 30:20.083
Everything was fine
before you showed up.

30:20.085 --> 30:21.985
You're hurting me.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.822
This is nothing.

30:24.824 --> 30:27.858
I've got a rifle in that van.
[dog barking]

30:27.860 --> 30:29.760
Don't make me use it.

30:32.096 --> 30:39.136
[dog continues barking]

30:39.138 --> 30:43.507
[car engine starting]

30:43.509 --> 30:46.610
I will run these over.
You two keep going.

30:46.612 --> 30:49.546
Wait, wait.
Couple more.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.181
How many is that,
6,000?

30:51.183 --> 30:53.217
Well, there's lots
of people searching.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.686
Hey, mom, make some
with just jelly,

30:55.688 --> 30:59.389
Just in case people are
allergic, all right?

30:59.391 --> 31:00.524
Oh!

31:00.526 --> 31:02.559
Oh, my god!
You scared me.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.328
I'm sorry, I know
I'm not supposed to be here.

31:04.330 --> 31:05.896
No, you're not.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.130
Who is it, honey?

31:07.132 --> 31:08.966
I-I think
you need to leave.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.235
I will, I am, but there's
something I need to tell you.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.703
I'm gonna call
detective carver.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.805
No, mom.
Wait.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.744
Is it about danny?

31:20.746 --> 31:24.381
No, it's about his friend,
tom miller.

31:38.096 --> 31:40.130
<i>(angela)</i>
<i>ellie.</i>

31:42.433 --> 31:45.836
Someone's seen tom.

31:45.838 --> 31:48.238
What?

31:48.240 --> 31:49.306
Where?

31:54.679 --> 31:57.881
Joe, what's happening?
Did you find him?

31:57.883 --> 31:59.616
Someone spotted him
on the road toward lincoln.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.385
They're moving everyone north.
Mark was the first to leave.

32:01.387 --> 32:02.686
He's been incredible.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.622
So tom was all right
when they saw him?

32:05.624 --> 32:07.124
He was on his bike.
It was this morning, but--

32:07.126 --> 32:08.358
Oh, god.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.028
I know.
It's something anyway.

32:12.230 --> 32:14.798
What?

32:14.800 --> 32:16.133
What's going on?

32:16.135 --> 32:17.968
Beth?

32:19.103 --> 32:22.372
[sighs]
um...

32:22.374 --> 32:28.578
There is this man.
Um, he hears messages.

32:28.580 --> 32:32.149
He's told me some things
about danny.

32:32.151 --> 32:33.817
Okay.

32:33.819 --> 32:35.886
Some of them
have been true,

32:35.888 --> 32:40.657
And I am sure that this isn't--
I hope, that it isn't--

32:40.659 --> 32:43.493
Okay, I'm sorry, wait, so he
told you something about tom?

32:43.495 --> 32:44.761
Yes.
[sighs]

32:44.763 --> 32:48.465
What did he tell you?

32:48.467 --> 32:52.502
That tom's been hurt.
That--that he--

32:52.504 --> 32:54.705
He's what?

32:57.175 --> 33:00.477
He's said he's bleeding.

33:07.118 --> 33:08.485
(paul)
all of gracepoint has joined
in the search for tom miller.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.355
Our town has come together
beautifully.

33:11.357 --> 33:14.491
If I can single out
one person in particular,

33:14.493 --> 33:17.861
Mark solano has taken charge
of our community search

33:17.863 --> 33:21.865
In a way that I find
especially moving.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.367
[softly]
thank you.

33:27.338 --> 33:28.839
Oh, your guy's banging
on the door.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.540
He says he's hungry.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.042
Yeah, he starts talking,
he'll get a five course meal.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.110
In fact,
I'll cook it myself.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.378
(julianne)
dad.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.146
Not now, julie.
I need to talk to you.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.115
I need to talk to our suspect,
all right, just give me--

33:38.117 --> 33:39.783
I've been sitting here
all day.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.385
I know, I know, and I hate
that I've made you wait,

33:41.387 --> 33:43.620
But one more interview.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.689
What is this?

33:45.691 --> 33:47.290
Come here, come here.

33:47.292 --> 33:48.859
Were you going
through my desk?

33:48.861 --> 33:51.361
Can you please just
tell me what this is?

33:51.363 --> 33:54.031
Are you sick?
I looked it up, and--

33:54.033 --> 33:55.065
I'm fine.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.200
That's not what I read.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.302
Is there something wrong
with your heart?

34:00.905 --> 34:02.639
Is...There something--

34:02.641 --> 34:04.141
Shh, shh.

34:06.644 --> 34:10.180
I get dizzy...Sometimes.

34:10.182 --> 34:11.481
This takes care of it.

34:11.483 --> 34:12.849
You get dizzy?

34:12.851 --> 34:14.384
What does that mean,
you get dizzy?

34:14.386 --> 34:15.385
It means you don't need
to worry about it.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.820
But--
I'm fine.

34:16.822 --> 34:19.556
I'm completely functional
and fine,

34:19.558 --> 34:22.592
And also--
and I'm sorry about this--

34:22.594 --> 34:24.561
But I have got work to do.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.997
Is this the reason you said no
to that ski trip last winter?

34:26.999 --> 34:28.198
Is this the reason
that mom said

34:28.200 --> 34:29.433
You shouldn't have
taken this job?

34:29.435 --> 34:31.101
A 12-year-old child
is missing.

34:31.103 --> 34:34.604
Yeah, you've said--
you need to stop this.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.840
It's always the same.

34:36.842 --> 34:40.243
All you care about is
other people's children.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.879
[scoffs]

34:42.881 --> 34:45.882
Go ahead,
talk to your lunatic.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.584
I know you want to.

34:49.954 --> 34:52.656
Go.

34:53.624 --> 34:55.592
I'll be 15 minutes--20.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.495
Will that--yeah?
That okay?

35:00.898 --> 35:03.700
I need change
for the snack machine.

35:11.809 --> 35:15.245
(emmett)
why was this boy headed
towards your house today

35:15.247 --> 35:17.981
If you've never
seen him before?

35:17.983 --> 35:19.783
He was headed
towards my house?

35:19.785 --> 35:23.053
On his bike, this morning,
riding up the highway.

35:23.055 --> 35:25.489
That's just a coincidence?

35:25.491 --> 35:29.126
I don't--I don't--
I don't know.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.227
You know him?

35:30.229 --> 35:32.863
No, not that I'm aware of.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.902
Who wrote this number?

35:38.904 --> 35:40.804
That's my cell phone number.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.507
Yeah, who wrote your cell number
on that piece of paper?

35:43.509 --> 35:45.642
It looks like
my handwriting.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.478
All right, you need to cut
the spacey, confused crap

35:48.480 --> 35:50.514
Right now, 'cause
I'm not buying it, all right?

35:50.516 --> 35:51.982
Did you write it?

35:51.984 --> 35:54.985
It looks like I wrote it,
so maybe I wrote it.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.052
[laughs]

35:59.590 --> 36:02.592
Have you ever met this boy?

36:02.594 --> 36:04.194
Focus!

36:04.196 --> 36:06.630
That's a different--
that's a different kid?

36:06.632 --> 36:09.499
Yes, it is.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.701
Whoa.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.203
[photo crackles]

36:13.205 --> 36:16.673
Hold on.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.775
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:18.777 --> 36:19.776
This is messed up.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.144
Have you met him?

36:21.146 --> 36:23.547
[chuckles]
budapest.

36:23.549 --> 36:26.016
Excuse me?
Budapest.

36:26.018 --> 36:28.251
What the hell does that mean,
"budapest"?

36:30.655 --> 36:33.823
I was walk--I was walking
down the coast near here,

36:33.825 --> 36:35.959
Like--like,
a couple of months ago,

36:35.961 --> 36:38.028
And there's him,
early in the morning,

36:38.030 --> 36:42.132
He's staring at the ocean,
looking for whales and stuff.

36:42.134 --> 36:45.569
I like looking at the whales.

36:45.571 --> 36:48.572
Those tokyo douche bags
that slaughter them

36:48.574 --> 36:51.408
And eat their blubber,
I could just...

36:51.410 --> 36:54.144
Cut them into little pieces
and see how they like it.

36:54.146 --> 36:56.479
Focus!
Tell me about the boy.

36:57.748 --> 37:00.350
Well...

37:00.352 --> 37:02.752
There he was.
He was sitting near the cliff,

37:02.754 --> 37:04.588
And he sees me,
and I see him,

37:04.590 --> 37:10.594
And he asks me, uh,
what the capital of hungary was.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.829
And--
[laughs]

37:12.831 --> 37:14.931
I don't usually know
that kind of stuff,

37:14.933 --> 37:18.768
But I-I was stationed in hungary
a couple years ago,

37:18.770 --> 37:22.272
So I told him budapest.

37:22.274 --> 37:24.608
Um...

37:24.610 --> 37:26.409
And then he wrote it
in his crossword and I--

37:26.411 --> 37:27.944
And I--the one
with the palace on it--

37:27.946 --> 37:31.248
Why did you give him
your phone number?

37:31.250 --> 37:32.349
My phone number?

37:32.351 --> 37:35.619
Why did you give it to him?

37:35.621 --> 37:39.956
He said he wanted
to see places.

37:39.958 --> 37:43.293
He wanted to get
out of his little town.

37:43.295 --> 37:47.797
I told him if he ever
wanted to talk,

37:47.799 --> 37:51.134
He could give me
a call and...

37:51.136 --> 37:56.640
He wrote--he tore off a piece
of his crossword, and I--

37:56.642 --> 38:02.345
I wrote my number down,
and I-I kept on walking.

38:04.148 --> 38:09.052
Is it bad?
Is he dead?

38:09.054 --> 38:10.887
Why are you asking that?

38:10.889 --> 38:14.491
Because I've seen guys
that...

38:14.493 --> 38:17.427
Know when someone's dead.

38:17.429 --> 38:20.530
They look like you look.

38:54.098 --> 38:57.367
Hey.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.703
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.204
I screwed up.
I don't--

39:01.206 --> 39:03.873
I don't know
what to say.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.176
I'm sorry too.

39:06.178 --> 39:11.081
This wasn't your fault.

39:13.217 --> 39:17.587
I just--
I'm just scared.

39:18.956 --> 39:20.890
It's okay.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.859
He's gonna be okay.

39:52.690 --> 39:54.090
Um...

39:54.092 --> 39:55.325
Frank.

39:55.327 --> 39:56.493
You know where
my daughter is?

39:56.495 --> 39:58.762
She left 20 minutes ago.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.196
Alone?

40:00.198 --> 40:01.664
She said she had
a bus to catch,

40:01.666 --> 40:04.734
So angela gave her a ride
down to the bus station.

Have to commend you, mark.

40:50.482 --> 40:53.616
Taking charge today,
bringing the community together.

40:53.618 --> 40:54.984
Just doing what I can.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.052
I know what they're
going through.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.554
I know you do.

40:59.723 --> 41:02.792
Should we look this way?

41:06.297 --> 41:09.766
You know, I've seen people,
sat by them

41:09.768 --> 41:12.836
As they've endured
all kinds of hardships.

41:12.838 --> 41:15.638
Not everyone responds
the way you have.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.309
Yeah, some people withdraw,
get angry,

41:19.311 --> 41:21.177
Some turn away
from their families,

41:21.179 --> 41:23.179
Turn to drink,
other vices.

41:23.181 --> 41:26.082
What are you trying to say?

41:26.084 --> 41:31.354
Just--just that you're--
you're a good man.
