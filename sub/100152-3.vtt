WEBVTT

00:29.821 --> 00:30.822
[grunts]

00:32.783 --> 00:36.036
-[man] Besides the backfire, how was she?
-Real sweet, Murph.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.790
It’s no X-15, but she
handles like a real beaut.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.626
-Yeah, she’s cherry.
-Hey, Chaddie. You piece of shit.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.795
They’ll let anyone land a plane
in this godforsaken town.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.755
Yeah. Navy still handing out
wings like candy, I see.

00:46.839 --> 00:47.840
[chuckles]

00:47.923 --> 00:49.091
-Oh, my bad.
-Pardon me.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.009
-No, that was my fault.
-Sorry.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.762
Ah, hey.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.391
-Weren’t you--
-The Tumbler Inn. Friday night.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.934
-You were with your friend.
-[laughs]

00:59.017 --> 01:01.562
-Likes the two-step? Yeah?
-Yeah, she likes to have fun.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.730
-Yeah, there’s nothing wrong with that.
-No.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.816
-So, what are you doing here?
-So, what are you doing here?

01:05.899 --> 01:07.276
[both chuckle]

01:07.359 --> 01:09.319
-You first.
-I was just--

01:09.403 --> 01:12.614
What’s a pretty girl like you
doing all the way out here?

01:12.698 --> 01:15.993
-Your boyfriend a pilot or something?
-No. No.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.287
-I came here by myself.
-Uh-huh.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.913
Always wanted to learn how to fly.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.790
Come on.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.584
What? Pretty girls can’t be pilots?

01:23.667 --> 01:27.045
Well, I suppose they can.
I just, I don’t know any who want to.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.380
Well, you do now.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.218
I’ve always wanted to learn how
to fly, ever since I was a kid.

01:37.681 --> 01:41.435
Say, you wouldn’t happen to know
any instructors, would you?

01:41.518 --> 01:43.770
Someone that could give a girl
her first lesson?

01:50.861 --> 01:53.280
[Gordo] Just gonna ease it
into a nice altitude for ya.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.324
Ahh.

01:55.908 --> 01:56.950
There you go.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.579
Best seat in the house.

02:00.662 --> 02:01.914
Never gets old.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.130
You’re gonna let me fly? Now?

02:10.214 --> 02:11.632
You gotta start sometime.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.425
Don’t worry about a thing, okay?

02:13.509 --> 02:14.968
I’m right here with ya.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.055
Push in.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.933
Houses get bigger.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.353
Pull back.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.106
Whoo. Houses get smaller.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.859
Let’s level that off.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.862
There you go.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.282
Okay, your turn.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.577
Okay, here I go.

02:42.204 --> 02:45.207
-Back. Houses are smaller.
-[chuckles]

02:49.545 --> 02:52.214
Okay, so you see how you’re
starting to lose speed?

02:52.297 --> 02:53.507
Uh-huh.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.511
-Okay, push down.
-[engine sputtering]

02:57.594 --> 03:00.472
Push down on the wheel.
We’ll go a little bit faster.

03:00.556 --> 03:02.891
-Is this what’s called a stall?
-That’s it.

03:02.975 --> 03:05.936
Down, honey. Down on the...
Push the wheel in.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.230
Oh! What are you doing? Ohh!

03:24.246 --> 03:26.832
Well, did I do it right,
Mister Navy Pilot Man?

03:27.958 --> 03:31.378
[laughs]

03:31.461 --> 03:34.214
Oh, shit.

03:34.298 --> 03:37.509
Ohh. Do-- Oh!

03:37.593 --> 03:38.510
Do that again.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.637
[laughs]

03:52.649 --> 03:53.650
[chuckles]

03:54.568 --> 03:55.986
[Gordo] Ahh.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.405
How long you been flying?

03:58.488 --> 04:01.700
725 hours. If anyone’s counting.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.328
Wow. You really had me going.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.954
[chuckles]

04:06.038 --> 04:09.333
Why the whole... Why not just...

05:33.333 --> 05:35.919
Americans across
the political spectrum are asking,

05:36.003 --> 05:39.923
“Are American women falling behind their
counterparts in the Soviet Union?”

05:40.007 --> 05:44.094
This in the wake of the moon landing of
female cosmonaut, Anastasia Belikova,

05:44.178 --> 05:47.389
who has become an overnight
sensation across the globe.

05:47.472 --> 05:51.518
The photograph taken of her
on the lunar surface, smiling in pure joy,

05:51.602 --> 05:54.563
has become an iconic image,
splashed across the front pages

05:54.646 --> 05:56.815
of magazines and newspapers
around the world.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.526
Belikova has been likened
to Rosie the Riveter,

05:59.610 --> 06:01.820
up until now, a uniquely American image

06:01.904 --> 06:04.907
that symbolized female strength
in the 1940s.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.410
This latest Soviet success
has cast doubt on NASA’s priorities

06:08.493 --> 06:09.953
as the rest of the world celebrates

06:10.037 --> 06:12.915
the incredible moment
in the history of womankind.

06:12.998 --> 06:18.170
[Kranz] We were converting the third stage
of a Saturn V into an orbiting workshop.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.173
Von Braun called it Skylab.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.926
Construction is already
underway in Huntsville.

06:24.009 --> 06:28.222
But it is still early enough to change the
trajectory of the conversion process.

06:28.305 --> 06:33.977
Current thinking is to take what would
have been Skylab and strip it down.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.231
Reduce the weight until we have
a launchable habitat module

06:37.314 --> 06:40.484
for our new permanently-manned
moon base, Moonlab.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.737
And how many military personnel
can we fit inside that thing?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.697
Doesn’t look that big.

06:45.781 --> 06:49.159
It’ll be manned by three astronauts at a
time for the first stages

06:49.243 --> 06:50.827
until the kinks are ironed out,

06:50.911 --> 06:55.123
and then there’ll be further expansions
that can include military aspects.

06:55.207 --> 06:59.545
What exactly are
the Pentagon’s plans in that regard?

07:02.005 --> 07:04.132
How soon will this Moonlab be ready?

07:05.342 --> 07:06.635
Two years, give or take.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.428
[scoffs] Jesus.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.013
[chuckles]

07:10.097 --> 07:12.933
You know, first we have to
find a place to land the damn thing.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.017
Uh-huh.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.020
Apollos 13, 14 and 15 are being re-tasked

07:17.104 --> 07:19.982
to survey for potential sites
for the base.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.317
And then we have to analyze those results.

07:22.401 --> 07:26.738
We look at geology, we do trade studies,
resource budgeting, system analysis.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.907
Change of plans, gentlemen.

07:28.991 --> 07:30.534
I thought you weren’t back until tomorrow.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.661
No, I wasn’t,
but the boss threw me a curve,

07:32.744 --> 07:35.289
and I thought I better get back ASAP.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.958
Uh, could you give us a minute, General?

07:47.050 --> 07:49.011
Well, this can’t be good.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.513
Not if it involves
Shorty Powers, it can’t.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.182
I am so misunderstood.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.475
The president feels it’s
of national importance

07:55.559 --> 07:57.019
that America equals the Soviets

07:57.102 --> 08:00.063
in its great achievement of
landing a woman on the moon.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.357
You mean his poll numbers
are down with women.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.526
[whistles]

08:04.610 --> 08:07.196
To this end, Nixon wants us
to put a woman on the moon.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.574
-Preferably a blonde.
-You can’t be serious.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.409
-What about Moonlab?
-What about what?

08:12.492 --> 08:13.785
Our lunar base.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.454
That’s a terrible name.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.873
This is bullshit, Tom.

08:17.956 --> 08:21.460
We’re on track to actually beat the
Soviets for a change. We can’t keep--

08:21.543 --> 08:24.004
Establishing a base on the moon
is still our top priority,

08:24.087 --> 08:26.632
but so is putting
a female astronaut on the moon.

08:26.715 --> 08:30.135
They’re both top priority.
Co-top priorities.

08:30.219 --> 08:34.932
[chuckles] Anybody tell the president that
we don’t have any female astronauts?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.225
Well, I think he’s aware.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.061
Every newspaper, magazine,
talk show and newscast

08:39.144 --> 08:41.188
is pointing it out on a daily basis.

08:41.270 --> 08:44.775
Can’t just put a woman on the moon.
She has to be an astronaut.

08:44.858 --> 08:48.070
There are procedures, training, tests.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.738
And I can’t just train one woman.

08:49.821 --> 08:53.158
I’ll need at least 20 candidates
to find one who can pass muster.

08:53.242 --> 08:54.952
For God’s sake, Deke.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.913
This is just something to throw the
women’s libbers and The New York Times.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.790
You don’t need to go through
the whole rigmarole.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.043
Just find a nice-enough looking lady
pilot, put her in a space suit,

09:03.126 --> 09:05.754
teach her to walk down the goddamn ladder,
and take her picture.

09:05.838 --> 09:11.552
Nobody gets into a spacecraft
in this program that I haven’t certified.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.972
The second that changes,
my resignation will be on your desk.

09:17.182 --> 09:21.186
I don’t think any of us, including the
president, would enjoy the bad press

09:21.270 --> 09:23.313
that would result
from Mr. Slayton’s resignation.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.898
It’s fine.

09:24.982 --> 09:27.526
You wanna train 20 women to find one?
Go right ahead.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.529
[chuckles]

09:33.115 --> 09:35.117
[chattering]

09:37.703 --> 09:39.872
The press called them the Mercury 13.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.331
Each was an experienced pilot

09:41.415 --> 09:44.001
with hundreds or thousands
of hours of flight time.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.004
Each passed the entire battery of physical
and psychological tests

09:47.087 --> 09:49.840
given the original Mercury Seven
male astronauts.

09:49.923 --> 09:53.093
Program was killed before they
could attend flight training in Pensacola.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.429
-[clears throat]
-[Deke] I remember.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.848
John Glenn really hated that whole thing.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.266
Well, Glenn’s not flying anymore.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.686
And he’s a Democrat,
so his opinion doesn’t matter.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.647
Are any of these ladies still flying? What
was this? Ten years ago?

10:05.731 --> 10:07.316
It was shut down seven years ago.

10:07.399 --> 10:10.611
And of the 13 pilots,
exactly two are still flying.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.155
The rest stopped because of kids,
husbands, that sort of thing.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.406
Who’s left?

10:14.990 --> 10:15.991
[sighs]

10:17.576 --> 10:18.911
Molly Cobb.

10:18.994 --> 10:21.455
Set aviation records
for long-distance solo flight,

10:21.538 --> 10:24.708
won several racing awards, qualified in
single and multi-engine aircraft,

10:24.791 --> 10:27.085
and was first in her class in Mercury 13,

10:27.169 --> 10:30.088
but she’s not really what
the president’s looking for.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.257
The hell does that mean?

10:34.176 --> 10:36.720
I mean, she’s a bit
rough around the edges. [chuckles]

10:36.803 --> 10:39.348
We need Marlo Thomas, not Danny Thomas.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.767
Jesus Christ, Shorty.
This isn’t a beauty contest.

10:41.850 --> 10:46.063
I’m telling you, the president is gonna
want a more enticing woman

10:46.146 --> 10:47.648
to be America’s first Moon Maiden.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.107
“Moon Maiden”?

10:49.191 --> 10:51.318
-I’m working on a press release.
-Keep working.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.404
Well, maybe she’ll get lucky and wash out
in favor of a Playmate of the Month.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.781
But for now...

11:00.160 --> 11:01.161
[sighs]

11:02.871 --> 11:04.373
Patty Doyle.

11:04.456 --> 11:08.752
Only other member of the Mercury 13 still
flying, mainly helicopters.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.797
She passed the Mercury test
with flying colors.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.216
Finished second in her class behind Cobb.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.342
She’ll do.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.937
[Kranz] Danielle Poole.

11:28.939 --> 11:32.276
Twenty-five years old,
has a bachelor’s of math and science--

11:32.359 --> 11:33.652
Perfect. She’s in.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.947
Hang on. I’m not letting her in
just because she’s black.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.866
That’s exactly why you’re letting her in.

11:38.949 --> 11:41.451
I do not need Jesse Jackson up my ass

11:41.535 --> 11:45.205
or Ralph Abernathy back here with his damn
mules making all that commotion.

11:45.289 --> 11:47.791
This time we’re getting
ahead of the story.

11:47.875 --> 11:51.461
She’s got 1,500 hours
in the air, a commercial pilot’s license,

11:51.545 --> 11:54.089
and she already works here at NASA.

11:54.173 --> 11:56.967
She’s an engineer over
with the computer ladies.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.510
You see?

12:02.890 --> 12:03.891
Fine.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.735
Okay, that’s our group then.

12:14.818 --> 12:15.944
[Shorty] Not quite.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.238
Great. Now what?

12:20.115 --> 12:21.825
Just got off the phone with Ron Ziegler.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.619
Who?

12:23.702 --> 12:26.788
White House press secretary.
This won’t be good either.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.374
Ziegler remembered this article
from a couple years ago

12:29.458 --> 12:32.669
and showed it to the president,
who thought it was a great idea.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.004
Thought what was a great idea?

12:37.174 --> 12:39.510
Huh! Gordo will lose his mind.

12:39.593 --> 12:40.928
[Deke] Be serious, Shorty.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.846
I am. I mean, let’s face it.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.516
We do not have one John Glenn
in that group, and it’s not even close.

12:45.599 --> 12:48.602
I don’t know. A couple of them look like
they’re starting to lose their hair.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.646
[sighs]

12:50.729 --> 12:52.856
[Shorty] Who in this group
is the all-American girl?

12:54.191 --> 12:56.443
The one people are gonna love
and take into their hearts

12:56.527 --> 12:58.070
and feel good about doing it?

12:58.153 --> 13:02.157
John Glenn wasn’t “John Glenn”
until he became “John Glenn.”

13:02.241 --> 13:05.536
John Glenn was always “John Glenn.” And
that’s why he was chosen for Mercury.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.539
If the president wants Tracy Stevens,
then Tracy Stevens he will have.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.416
America’s space couple.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.877
That’s Gordo’s wife.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.463
She’s a mother, for Chrissake.
How’s she gonna manage that?

13:16.547 --> 13:17.798
Get her a nanny.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.675
-What if she says no?
-Change her mind.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.802
-What if she flunks out?
-See that she doesn’t.

13:21.885 --> 13:25.389
I make the crew selections.
I thought that was clear.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.183
I didn’t say put her on a crew.
I said don’t flunk her out.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.645
She can be the goddamn mascot
for all I care. But she’s in.

13:31.728 --> 13:37.025
You think Gordo’s gonna be all right with
his wife working the same place he does?

13:37.109 --> 13:39.778
How’d you like to see Barbara
in the hallways, Tom?

13:39.862 --> 13:41.196
Or Mary?

13:42.281 --> 13:45.784
Not to mention his... shenanigans.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.161
Come on. We can’t do this.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.874
Just give him something he wants.
Make it worth his while.

13:51.957 --> 13:55.335
I don’t care what you have
to do. Just do it. She’s in.

14:26.491 --> 14:30.454
I think maybe Tracy and I
need to discuss this in private

14:30.537 --> 14:33.707
before, you know,
we arrive at anything definite.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.791
Yes.

14:35.626 --> 14:36.752
Sorry, hon?

14:37.669 --> 14:39.296
[clears throat] Yes, I’ll do it.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.050
-Great news.
-There’s my girl.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.011
Everyone’s going to be very
happy to hear that, Tracy.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.347
-Welcome aboard.
-I won’t let you down, Deke.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.225
No worries there, Tracy.

14:52.768 --> 14:54.144
See you back at the ranch.

14:55.479 --> 14:57.481
[footsteps receding]

15:00.526 --> 15:02.402
Holy shit.

15:02.486 --> 15:05.697
Look at you.
Astronaut candidate Tracy Stevens.

15:05.781 --> 15:09.368
Ahh. That is crazy. I mean, wow.

15:12.538 --> 15:15.123
So, you’re just okay with this?

15:15.207 --> 15:16.875
Sure. Why wouldn’t I be?

15:16.959 --> 15:19.503
I mean, if you think it’s a good idea,
then I’m all for it.

15:21.004 --> 15:24.341
-What’s Deke giving you?
-Huh? No, Deke-- I mean, you know Deke.

15:25.968 --> 15:26.969
He gave you a slot.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.263
He doesn’t throw out
crew slots willy-nilly.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.598
I mean,
he’s a son of a bitch on that front.

15:31.682 --> 15:32.891
Let me tell you.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.893
He...

15:34.977 --> 15:37.646
-Fifteen. He gave me slot on Apollo 15.
-There it is. Yeah.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.857
That does not matter right now.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.150
What’s important is you.

15:42.234 --> 15:44.444
You’re gonna be an astronaut candidate.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.991
No. I’m gonna be an astronaut.

15:51.743 --> 15:56.373
One day I’m gonna have one of those pins
on my collar just like you.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.835
Someone’s got a fire up her ass.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.796
-[chuckles]
-I like it. A lot.

16:04.548 --> 16:07.509
We should celebrate.
Steaks at the Lamplighter.

16:07.593 --> 16:09.136
-Mm.
-Huh?

16:11.388 --> 16:13.849
No, let’s try the new Chinese place.
I’ll go get dressed.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.934
Hey, come on, you look great.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.394
I’ll only be a minute.

16:38.916 --> 16:40.751
[chuckles]

16:42.002 --> 16:44.213
And although NASA
has not released the names

16:44.296 --> 16:47.341
of the female candidates
accepted to the program,

16:47.424 --> 16:50.219
we’ve learned that one of
the ladies is none other than

16:50.302 --> 16:54.598
the wife of astronaut
Gordon “Gordo” Stevens.

16:54.681 --> 16:59.770
Mrs. Stevens was a pilot herself
when she met her future husband,

16:59.853 --> 17:03.190
a story chronicled in  Look  magazine

17:03.273 --> 17:07.486
under the heading “Love in the Skies.”

17:07.569 --> 17:10.195
-May I please be excused?
-[Baldwin mumbling]

17:10.280 --> 17:12.031
-Yes, you may.
-Thank you.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.993
I mean, it’s just embarrassing, Ed.

17:17.913 --> 17:18.914
[scoffs]

17:20.415 --> 17:22.376
Orders, you know. Straight from the top.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.755
So, Tracy Stevens is gonna fly in space?

17:28.757 --> 17:30.342
Deke’s call, you know?

17:30.425 --> 17:33.136
I heard he threatened to resign if they
took crew selection away from him.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.721
Well, you don’t seem very bothered by it.

17:35.764 --> 17:36.807
I mean...

17:39.351 --> 17:41.687
Not really my concern,
you know? I’m focused on 15.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.397
But I don’t think it’s a great idea--

17:43.480 --> 17:44.898
Not a great idea?

17:46.233 --> 17:49.152
Ed, they are making
a mockery of what you do.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.237
Well...

17:50.320 --> 17:54.908
I mean, you have trained
and you’ve worked and you’ve suffered.

17:54.992 --> 17:59.162
You’ve taken enormous risks over years to
get where you are. And now what?

17:59.246 --> 18:03.625
Now these women, they’re just gonna waltz
in and get pinned and fly.

18:04.543 --> 18:07.129
And why? Because the Soviets did?

18:08.463 --> 18:11.008
-I-- It’s-- It’s--
-[sighs]

18:11.091 --> 18:16.138
Look. Ed, she’s not remotely capable
of doing what you do.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.723
None of them are.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.725
Couple of them supposed to be
pretty good pilots.

18:20.893 --> 18:23.520
But you’re probably right.

18:23.604 --> 18:25.981
-Jesus, Ed.
-’Course you’re right. You’re 100% right.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.444
-Got to be kidding me!
-I’m sorry.

18:30.527 --> 18:31.653
I’m...

18:32.905 --> 18:34.198
I’m sorry.

18:38.452 --> 18:39.453
Um...

18:42.289 --> 18:44.291
[chattering]

18:58.972 --> 19:00.974
[chattering]

19:14.154 --> 19:15.906
“Love in the Skies.”

19:40.889 --> 19:42.432
[clears throat]

19:42.516 --> 19:44.268
-May I sit here?
-Of course.

19:48.564 --> 19:49.857
Thank you.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.483
I’m Tracy.

19:51.567 --> 19:52.651
Danielle.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.202
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

20:02.286 --> 20:04.371
I had a feeling you’d be here, Molly.

20:05.497 --> 20:06.748
Beats the circus.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.295
Looks like we’re the only two
Mercurys still kicking tires.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.173
Yeah. Well, it’s good to know
you’ll be right behind me.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.674
Just like the old days.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.512
Ladies, take your seats.
We’ll get this show on the road.

20:22.598 --> 20:24.433
My name is Deke Slayton.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.603
I’m head of the astronaut office, and I’m
here to welcome you to NASA.

20:27.686 --> 20:32.608
Congratulations. As of this moment, you
are officially astronaut candidates.

20:32.691 --> 20:36.195
Affectionately referred to
from this point on as ASCANs.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.738
[all laughing]

20:42.743 --> 20:45.871
You come from near and far
and all across America.

20:47.206 --> 20:49.625
Those of you who were
part of the Mercury 13,

20:49.708 --> 20:51.752
Patty Doyle, Molly Cobb,

20:51.835 --> 20:54.296
I know you’ve waited
for this day for a long time.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.843
But these aren’t the Mercury tests.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.137
No.

21:02.221 --> 21:06.558
This is a rigorous, 24-hour-a-day,
seven-day-a-week training program

21:06.642 --> 21:08.185
preparing you for space travel.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.270
There are 20 of you here today.

21:10.354 --> 21:12.898
I expect that number to be
far less a year from now.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.275
Honestly,

21:15.359 --> 21:17.611
I don’t know if any of you
will still be here.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.863
Here’s how this works.

21:19.947 --> 21:22.491
I’m going to be grading you
as we go along.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.993
And everything you do will be graded.

21:25.077 --> 21:29.248
Pilot performance, academics,
your character and motivation.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.124
I’ll post results periodically.

21:31.208 --> 21:33.836
If your name’s not on the list,
you’re cut.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.421
Get your stuff and go home.

21:39.258 --> 21:41.468
Kill the lights. Let’s get
to the program overview.

21:44.137 --> 21:48.976
Basic science programs,
jet qualification, celestial navigation,

21:49.059 --> 21:53.564
simulator training, guidance,
navigation and control training.

22:08.662 --> 22:12.374
[man] In Moscow today, Premier Alexei
Kosygin accused the Nixon administration

22:12.457 --> 22:15.919
of planning to put missiles on the
recently proposed American moon base

22:16.003 --> 22:18.922
in violation of the Space Treaty of 1967.

22:19.006 --> 22:21.049
The White House denies the accusation,

22:21.133 --> 22:24.887
saying it will not be the first country to
introduce weapons in space.

22:24.970 --> 22:29.016
Tensions are as high as they’ve ever been
as the “race for a base” continues.

22:29.099 --> 22:32.811
Fifty bucks says this whole thing
doesn’t make it past month two.

22:34.688 --> 22:36.523
I don’t know.

22:36.607 --> 22:38.817
I think we’re going all the way this time,
Molly.

22:40.527 --> 22:44.281
Last time you said that, we ended up
spending the night in a Tulsa drunk tank.

22:45.657 --> 22:46.992
That was a long time ago.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.578
Yeah.

22:49.661 --> 22:53.707
Just don’t go getting your hopes up beyond
anything other than the here and now.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.502
Things ain’t changed that much.

23:06.637 --> 23:08.180
You ever flown a jet before?

23:09.848 --> 23:11.058
Couple times.

23:12.643 --> 23:13.977
I’ve always wanted to.

23:18.065 --> 23:19.650
-You’re not married?
-No.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.109
But you’re so pretty.

23:23.195 --> 23:25.531
-You sound like my mother.
-Yeah, that can’t be good.

23:26.907 --> 23:27.950
It’s not.

23:29.034 --> 23:30.410
[jet approaching]

23:30.494 --> 23:31.745
Oh, here comes Janice.

23:33.539 --> 23:35.249
She’s carrying too much speed.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.756
Told ya.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.299
She porpoised.

23:44.383 --> 23:46.134
Deke’s not gonna like that.

23:46.218 --> 23:47.636
[Deke] Stevens, you’re up!

23:52.224 --> 23:53.433
Shit.

23:53.517 --> 23:55.561
So, if you enter these
two parameters, you’ll be fine.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.866
[Baldwin] Cabin pressure’s good, Trace.

24:08.949 --> 24:10.868
I mean, Candidate Stevens.

24:10.951 --> 24:13.287
[chuckles]

24:13.370 --> 24:14.955
Check your oxygen regulator.

24:16.707 --> 24:19.793
Got a good blinker, Commander Baldwin.

24:19.877 --> 24:21.336
[laughs]

24:23.338 --> 24:25.257
Start with an easy turn to the left.

24:28.260 --> 24:31.889
You push the throttle on a prop plane,
you get an immediate result.

24:31.972 --> 24:34.266
Jets, you gotta think way ahead.

24:34.349 --> 24:37.311
-Copy that.
-Let’s make an easy turn to the right.

24:37.394 --> 24:38.395
Copy.

24:41.315 --> 24:44.484
Airfield in view, ten o’clock, five miles.

24:44.568 --> 24:47.112
You ready to crash,
I mean, land this sucker?

24:48.071 --> 24:50.616
[chuckles] Copy that. Yes, sir.

24:50.699 --> 24:53.535
Remember what we talked about
the other day. T-38 lands fast.

24:53.619 --> 24:57.164
So, you come in slow, you’ll stall.
Come in fast, you’ll land long.

24:57.247 --> 24:58.248
Copy that.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.502
[Baldiwn] All right, here we go.

25:01.585 --> 25:05.339
Watch your airspeed.
170, you’re fast. Push the throttles back.

25:05.422 --> 25:09.676
All right, still fast, 160.
Keep working the throttles off.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.887
Here we go. Now flare. Nose up. Nose up.

25:18.894 --> 25:19.895
[exhales]

25:25.317 --> 25:28.278
Women applicants will be interviewed today
for the new space program

25:28.362 --> 25:30.739
that will send an American
man and woman team of astronauts

25:30.822 --> 25:32.324
as the first couple on the moon.

25:35.494 --> 25:36.620
Hello?

25:38.789 --> 25:40.290
Danny, look who’s here.

25:40.374 --> 25:41.375
Hi, Mom.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.669
-Hi, baby. How was your day?
-Good.

25:44.878 --> 25:46.255
Missed you.

25:46.338 --> 25:49.007
Thank you so much. I’m sorry I’m late.

25:49.091 --> 25:53.595
-It’s fine. Boys already had their dinner.
-Wow.

25:53.679 --> 25:57.015
Hey, you two, cut it out.
Do not point those at each other.

25:57.099 --> 25:59.309
Yeah, we were doing
emergency egress drills,

25:59.393 --> 26:02.187
and so, there’s no way
to handle a phone in that suit.

26:03.063 --> 26:04.064
[clears throat]

26:05.524 --> 26:07.401
It’s no problem, honestly.

26:09.987 --> 26:12.948
Yeah, Ed told me that you
made it through the first cut.

26:13.949 --> 26:15.033
Congratulations.

26:15.117 --> 26:16.535
Thank you.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.161
Yeah, Ed’s, uh...

26:19.621 --> 26:21.957
you know, Ed’s really
been a help with training.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.419
You know, I don’t think
I could’ve gotten this far without him.

26:27.087 --> 26:28.547
I’m glad that he’s been a help.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.924
You know, he puts his all
into everything that he does.

26:31.008 --> 26:32.050
Oh, yeah.

26:33.135 --> 26:35.262
I just hope that
he’s focused enough on 15.

26:36.138 --> 26:37.181
’Course he is.

26:37.264 --> 26:39.308
If anything,

26:39.391 --> 26:42.644
it’s me trying to keep
my head above water.

26:43.937 --> 26:47.065
It’s, uh... it’s not easy.

26:50.027 --> 26:51.945
Well, it’s not supposed to be easy, Tracy.

26:57.326 --> 27:00.537
Hey, Danny, thank Mrs. Baldwin.

27:01.580 --> 27:03.207
Go get your jacket on. Let’s get going.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.293
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome. See you soon, buddy.

27:06.376 --> 27:08.337
-Have a good night, Shane.
-[Shane] Good night.

27:09.588 --> 27:10.839
-Thanks again, Karen.
-Mm-hmm.

27:10.923 --> 27:12.299
[Tracy] Let’s go get your brother.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.134
Let’s put everything away, all right?

27:17.095 --> 27:19.306
[Margo] To safely return the crew,

27:19.389 --> 27:22.184
the command module has
to enter Earth’s atmosphere

27:22.267 --> 27:23.936
at exactly the right angle

27:24.019 --> 27:27.856
while coming in at 25,000 miles per hour.

27:29.733 --> 27:32.611
That’s 36,000 feet per second...

27:33.695 --> 27:34.738
like a meteorite.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.907
That’s literally what you are.

27:38.367 --> 27:41.578
And if you plunge through
at a steep angle, you’ll burn up.

27:41.662 --> 27:46.458
But if you hit the atmosphere too shallow,
you’ll just bounce off back into space.

27:52.673 --> 27:55.175
-Cart.
-Huh?

27:55.259 --> 27:56.552
Four-letter word for “wagon.”

28:02.599 --> 28:05.269
I understand the reentry equations.

28:05.352 --> 28:06.728
I hope so.

28:13.026 --> 28:14.319
Let’s find out.

28:18.949 --> 28:21.201
-Pop quiz.
-[women groaning]

29:10.125 --> 29:12.711
-Janice?
-[sobs]

29:12.794 --> 29:14.379
I guess she didn’t make the cut.

29:27.017 --> 29:29.603
I couldn’t have done it without
you nipping at my heels, Doyle.

29:34.149 --> 29:36.318
Fifth. Dammit.

29:46.078 --> 29:47.162
Oh, God.

29:53.001 --> 29:55.671
[country music playing]

30:00.884 --> 30:04.054
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

30:04.137 --> 30:05.597
Hell’s bells, Cobb.

30:06.515 --> 30:07.808
Double or nothing?

30:07.891 --> 30:09.142
Rack ’em.

30:12.896 --> 30:14.940
[women laughing]

30:20.028 --> 30:21.864
-You notice it yet?
-What’s that?

30:23.448 --> 30:25.409
How every guy in this bar
is trying to pretend

30:25.492 --> 30:28.245
he doesn’t hate the fact
that we’re standing here.

30:28.328 --> 30:29.830
’Cause you know what we are?

30:31.164 --> 30:33.876
We’re change in living color.

30:33.959 --> 30:35.252
Us standing here means that

30:35.335 --> 30:38.380
their time on top of the shitpile’s
coming to a close,

30:38.463 --> 30:40.299
and they don’t like it one bit.

30:40.382 --> 30:42.134
Give it up, Doyle.

30:42.217 --> 30:44.887
They’ll get around to screwin’ us over,
just like they did last time.

30:46.555 --> 30:47.890
Not them I’m worried about.

30:50.767 --> 30:52.060
Look at them.

30:52.144 --> 30:53.604
They just waltzed into this program

30:53.687 --> 30:56.023
like we weren’t trying to
get this done ten years ago.

30:56.899 --> 30:58.567
Come on. They’re not so bad.

31:01.069 --> 31:02.863
They got no idea how hard it’s gonna be

31:02.946 --> 31:05.282
when the shit hits the fan
and they shut this thing down.

31:05.365 --> 31:06.992
And you know it’s gonna happen, right?

31:10.287 --> 31:12.831
And they all have to go back
to their miserable little lives

31:12.915 --> 31:14.291
in bumfuck wherever.

31:15.501 --> 31:16.835
I feel sorry for ’em.

31:17.586 --> 31:20.130
Except for the astro wife.

31:20.214 --> 31:24.551
She is gonna be just fine going back to
her cushy little life and her hubby.

31:26.345 --> 31:29.431
The scariest thing I ever flew
was an S-2 Pitts.

31:29.515 --> 31:30.557
Oh, damn.

31:30.641 --> 31:32.434
That aircraft will kill you
in a heartbeat.

31:32.518 --> 31:33.644
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

31:34.353 --> 31:35.354
Wow.

31:36.396 --> 31:37.689
How about you, Tracy?

31:39.316 --> 31:40.984
Oh, uh... [chuckles]

31:41.068 --> 31:44.238
Well, you know. Uh...

31:44.321 --> 31:45.447
[clears throat]

31:45.531 --> 31:50.494
My brother actually taught me
to fly in a Piper Cub.

31:50.577 --> 31:53.330
It’s not state of the art
or anything, I know, but...

31:55.832 --> 31:57.042
You know, actually...

32:02.130 --> 32:05.801
One time, he had me try the AT-6.

32:05.884 --> 32:06.927
[woman] Oh, golly.

32:07.010 --> 32:10.472
And that move from 40 to 600 horsepower...

32:12.182 --> 32:14.351
it was a real eye-opener.

32:14.434 --> 32:15.811
I’ll bet. [chuckles]

32:15.894 --> 32:18.105
No, but, if I’m honest,

32:18.188 --> 32:21.358
I haven’t really flown much
in the last few years, so...

32:21.441 --> 32:23.652
Well, that’s understandable.
You got two kids.

32:25.237 --> 32:26.738
Yeah, I guess.

32:27.573 --> 32:29.783
I mean...

32:29.867 --> 32:33.954
flying just didn’t seem like an option
as a career, you know?

32:35.205 --> 32:36.456
I ended up a nurse.

32:37.583 --> 32:41.211
NICU... for a while anyway.

32:41.962 --> 32:43.380
I was a secretary.

32:45.591 --> 32:47.759
Switchboard operator. [chuckles]

32:47.843 --> 32:48.844
Computer.

32:49.469 --> 32:51.054
What’s that?

32:51.138 --> 32:54.975
We did calculations
and some engineering at NASA.

32:55.058 --> 32:58.520
But that wasn’t nearly
as glamorous as all this.

32:58.604 --> 33:00.230
[all laughing]

33:00.314 --> 33:03.400
You know what? Gordo gave me so much shit
for coming here tonight.

33:03.483 --> 33:05.611
-Come on.
-I’m serious.

33:05.694 --> 33:09.489
He said he wouldn’t even have dreamt of
stepping foot in this place,

33:09.573 --> 33:13.285
in the Outpost,
unless he had his astronaut pin.

33:13.368 --> 33:15.913
It’s not a church.
It’s a bar with a roach problem.

33:15.996 --> 33:17.247
Mm-hmm.

33:17.331 --> 33:19.541
Some of these guys act
like it’s a nightly communion.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.585
-Oh, yeah.
-They’re not the only ones.

33:23.420 --> 33:24.546
[woman 1 clears throat]

33:24.630 --> 33:28.634
[woman 2] Well, Patty’s nice.
Molly, she’s, uh...

33:32.054 --> 33:34.556
I don’t know. I just thought
she’d be more encouraging.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.266
-Mm-hmm.
-You know?

33:36.350 --> 33:39.603
She’s not here to make friends.
And she’s right.

33:42.606 --> 33:47.069
I mean, I like all of you,
but only one of us is gonna be chosen.

33:49.863 --> 33:50.864
[Tracy] Well...

33:52.574 --> 33:56.203
till then, can I buy y’all another round?

33:56.286 --> 33:58.914
-[woman] Yes.
-[all laughing]

33:58.997 --> 33:59.998
[woman 2] Yes.

34:06.588 --> 34:08.465
[man] Blackjack, Houston for Danielle.

34:08.549 --> 34:11.802
Please give us a status
on our pH indicator for fuel cell one.

34:11.885 --> 34:15.806
Copy that, Houston. I’ve got
barber poles on fuel cell one.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.558
The other two talk-backs are nominal.

34:21.270 --> 34:22.896
-[fingers snap]
-Snap to it.

34:24.523 --> 34:26.065
You okay?

34:26.149 --> 34:27.775
Yeah. Early morning.

34:27.860 --> 34:30.070
Blackjack, Houston for Tracy.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.906
Please open all four Helium-1 iso valves.

34:32.989 --> 34:36.201
Copy that, Houston.
Opening helium system one.

34:39.371 --> 34:40.621
It’s right there.

34:43.041 --> 34:45.210
-[switch clicks]
-[rumbling]

34:47.212 --> 34:50.674
Nice job, Blackjack.
We see good RCS tank pressurization.

34:51.507 --> 34:52.509
You’re welcome.

34:55.387 --> 34:58.557
Fail the guidance computer.
Have them come in manually.

34:58.640 --> 35:01.852
That’s just mean.
You know they’re not ready for that.

35:01.935 --> 35:04.313
We don’t have time
to wait for them to be ready.

35:06.398 --> 35:09.234
[blusters]

35:09.318 --> 35:13.780
“What we’ve got here
is a failure to communicate.”

35:15.115 --> 35:16.491
Cool Hand Luke.

35:19.953 --> 35:23.248
-I grew up in movie theaters.
-Hmm.

35:23.332 --> 35:26.627
-You see Butch Cassidy?
-Love the movie. Hate the music.

35:26.710 --> 35:28.504
Ah, a traditionalist.

35:28.587 --> 35:30.631
You must love Magnificent Seven.

35:30.714 --> 35:33.217
Well, yeah. It’s the best
Western soundtrack ever recorded.

35:33.300 --> 35:36.678
Better than Red River?
You got a lot to learn, kid.

35:36.762 --> 35:38.347
Work now. Flirt later.

35:38.430 --> 35:41.141
Yes, ma’am. Right away, ma’am.
Working. Aye, aye, ma’am.

35:48.482 --> 35:50.692
-[alarm beeping]
-Master caution alarm.

35:53.278 --> 35:55.822
Primary guidance has failed.
We need to do this manually.

35:55.906 --> 35:58.825
-What?
-Take manual control.

35:58.909 --> 36:02.496
Okay, we need to maintain constant g’s.
Watch your g-meter and your EMS scroll.

36:02.579 --> 36:05.082
-Yeah, I got it.
-Don’t get over four g’s or we’ll burn up.

36:05.165 --> 36:06.583
I got it.

36:06.667 --> 36:08.460
-Your attitude rates are getting high.
-I see it.

36:08.544 --> 36:09.711
[beeping]

36:09.795 --> 36:11.588
You’re fighting the deadband.
Lower your gains.

36:11.672 --> 36:13.298
Stop being a backseat commander.

36:18.303 --> 36:21.807
Shit! We’re coming in too steep.
Accel’s at seven g’s.

36:22.891 --> 36:24.601
Pulling lift vector up.

36:24.685 --> 36:26.144
Too late. We’re gonna burn up.

36:27.229 --> 36:30.482
-[tone blaring]
-[sighs]

36:30.566 --> 36:31.984
[Molly] Great. We’re dead.

36:32.067 --> 36:33.694
[exhales]

36:33.777 --> 36:36.196
[man] End of sim. Prepare for debrief.

36:39.283 --> 36:40.659
[Molly sighs]

36:43.078 --> 36:44.246
Sorry, y’all.

36:45.372 --> 36:47.165
So, what, you didn’t get much sleep?

36:48.917 --> 36:50.544
Was it Gordo?

36:50.627 --> 36:52.171
Was it the kids?

36:52.963 --> 36:54.381
Was it the dog?

36:55.716 --> 36:57.551
-Look--
-You know, I don’t give a good goddamn.

36:59.052 --> 37:00.554
You’re tired?

37:00.637 --> 37:02.931
Your job is not to be tired.

37:03.015 --> 37:05.684
Yeah, I know, I know. I’m trying to just--

37:05.767 --> 37:09.313
You ain’t flown that much,
you got kids, you’re not an engineer.

37:09.396 --> 37:11.690
A lot of exceptions
have been made for you, Tracy Stevens.

37:11.773 --> 37:15.444
So, I don’t get how you see fit to
complain about any damn thing.

37:15.527 --> 37:16.904
What are you saying, Cobb?

37:16.987 --> 37:19.239
What I’m saying is that other
than being a pretty face

37:19.323 --> 37:21.116
and married to Gordo Stevens,

37:21.200 --> 37:23.869
I don’t get what you’ve done
to deserve still being here.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.789
I know why I’m here,
I know why Patty’s here,

37:27.873 --> 37:32.127
and Dani and pretty much everyone
except for you, astro wife.

37:33.337 --> 37:35.047
Why are you still here?

37:39.843 --> 37:40.844
[exhales]

37:42.429 --> 37:45.682
And she’s right. I mean,
why am I still doing this, huh?

37:45.766 --> 37:48.268
Why am I still doing this,
Gordo? It’s a joke.

37:48.352 --> 37:49.770
Hey, don’t talk like that.

37:49.853 --> 37:53.565
-Hon, you got a real shot at this.
-[scoffs]

37:53.649 --> 37:57.110
And Shorty, he said your final jet scores
were amongst the highest in the class.

37:57.194 --> 37:58.403
-You’re a good pilot.
-No.

37:58.487 --> 37:59.988
Trace, you’ve always been a good pilot.

38:00.072 --> 38:01.532
I was a good pilot eight years ago.

38:01.615 --> 38:04.785
Now I’m just a housewife
trying to remember basic radio navigation.

38:04.868 --> 38:07.746
And why are you talking
to Shorty Powers about my test scores?

38:07.829 --> 38:10.707
He mentioned it in passing.

38:10.791 --> 38:13.043
I think you gotta see this out, Trace.

38:15.212 --> 38:17.589
I should’ve been bounced weeks ago.

38:17.673 --> 38:20.551
And everyone knows that
the only reason I’m still here

38:20.634 --> 38:22.970
is because Shorty wants his space couple.

38:23.053 --> 38:24.763
Come on, Tracy.

38:24.847 --> 38:26.431
I’m a laughingstock, Gordo.

38:27.099 --> 38:28.600
I am a laughingstock,

38:28.684 --> 38:32.521
and you are fine with your wife
being humiliated like this

38:32.604 --> 38:34.565
because you don’t wanna lose a seat on 15.

38:34.648 --> 38:36.775
-This isn’t about me.
-It’s always about you!

38:36.859 --> 38:38.735
Every goddamn thing is about you.

38:38.819 --> 38:39.903
Don’t start this shit.

38:39.987 --> 38:42.030
It’s been that way since the day we met.

38:42.114 --> 38:45.993
This entire household
revolves around King Gordo.

38:46.076 --> 38:49.413
Don’t change the subject.
This is about you wanting to punch out

38:49.496 --> 38:51.248
the first time something
gets a little tough.

38:51.331 --> 38:55.169
“A little tough”? Have you listened to one
goddamn word I’ve said?

38:55.252 --> 38:56.795
I’ve listened to everything you’ve said.

38:56.879 --> 38:59.923
“Sim training was hard,
jet qualification was hard, math is hard.

39:00.007 --> 39:02.509
Everything’s so hard.
I may as well just lie down and quit.”

39:04.344 --> 39:08.140
Jesus Christ, Trace.
Show some goddamn... guts!

39:08.223 --> 39:11.351
Don’t let something small as
that run you outta the program.

39:14.438 --> 39:16.106
So, that’s what you think of me, huh?

39:18.942 --> 39:20.611
That I don’t have guts?

39:21.528 --> 39:22.905
That I’m the quitter?

39:26.325 --> 39:28.619
That’s what you’re talking
about doing, isn’t it?

39:28.702 --> 39:32.289
Packing up your toys because some girl
said something mean to me in the sim.

39:33.624 --> 39:35.459
-[glass shatters]
-Get out!

39:36.418 --> 39:37.586
[sobs]

39:37.669 --> 39:39.087
I’m going, all right.

39:45.677 --> 39:47.471
I said get the fuck out!

39:47.554 --> 39:49.056
-[banging]
-[Gordo] Jesus.

[door slams shut]

39:55.562 --> 39:56.730
[sniffles]

39:58.398 --> 39:59.816
Oh, God.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.485
[car door closes]

40:01.568 --> 40:04.404
[engine starts, revs]

40:04.488 --> 40:06.323
[vehicle departing]

40:08.408 --> 40:09.618
[clatters on floor]

40:12.120 --> 40:13.330
[sobbing]

41:03.380 --> 41:05.757
On the moon? Is that even possible?

41:05.841 --> 41:09.511
Ray, how sure are you that those
bright spots are really ice?

41:09.595 --> 41:11.180
I’m not. I can’t be.

41:11.263 --> 41:14.224
It’s just one of the possibilities
the data suggests.

41:14.308 --> 41:17.686
The instruments on the lunar orbiter
weren’t designed

41:17.769 --> 41:19.229
for that kind of analysis.

41:19.313 --> 41:21.023
[Baldwin] We’ll know more after Apollo 15.

41:21.106 --> 41:24.151
Our CM’s going up with an enhanced
infrared photo-spectrometer.

41:24.234 --> 41:26.778
-Get us better data.
-I’ll tell you this.

41:26.862 --> 41:32.117
I mean, if he’s right, if there is water
up there, that changes everything.

41:32.201 --> 41:34.536
-How so?
-[Ray] Well, sir, we can drink it.

41:34.620 --> 41:36.288
So we don’t have to haul up our own.

41:36.371 --> 41:38.707
And we can use it
to grow plants hydroponically.

41:38.790 --> 41:41.251
But the really exciting thing, sir,

41:41.335 --> 41:45.547
we can electrically separate H2O
into hydrogen and oxygen,

41:45.631 --> 41:47.049
then liquefy them to produce--

41:47.132 --> 41:48.300
English, please.

41:48.383 --> 41:51.094
He’s saying we can use it
to make rocket fuel.

41:51.178 --> 41:54.348
Same kind we use
in the upper stages of the Saturn V.

41:54.431 --> 41:58.810
A refueling station on our way
to the rest of the solar system.

42:00.646 --> 42:03.607
-[chuckles]
-[clears throat]

42:03.690 --> 42:05.943
Good work, Ray. Thanks.

42:09.196 --> 42:12.074
[chattering]

42:12.157 --> 42:14.159
Um, hey, guys.

42:15.619 --> 42:18.914
The president wants to know
how we’re doing with his women,

42:19.665 --> 42:21.041
specifically Stevens’ wife.

42:21.124 --> 42:23.794
He really hopes she’s the one.

42:23.877 --> 42:27.297
You can tell him his women
are about to do desert survival training.

42:28.090 --> 42:29.383
You’re really doing that?

42:29.466 --> 42:30.968
It’s part of the program.

42:31.051 --> 42:33.095
Are you trying to wash them out?

42:34.680 --> 42:37.891
They can’t haul a 40-pound pack
20 miles in the desert sun.

42:37.975 --> 42:40.686
They have to be able to handle
all aspects of spaceflight,

42:40.769 --> 42:43.313
including survival
after a botched landing.

42:44.273 --> 42:45.691
You’ll lose half of them out there.

42:45.774 --> 42:49.486
If they can’t survive the desert,
they can’t survive the moon.

43:03.125 --> 43:04.751
[Deke] Ladies, here’s the scenario.

43:05.544 --> 43:07.337
You are flying a solo mission.

43:07.421 --> 43:11.133
Your spacecraft has gone off course, and
you have landed in the desert.

43:11.216 --> 43:14.553
You have your parachute
and the spacecraft survival kit.

43:14.636 --> 43:17.431
Strapped to your back
is 40 pounds of gear.

43:17.514 --> 43:21.643
You have no maps of the area,
and you are out of radio communication.

43:21.727 --> 43:25.480
Your goal is to make it
to a checkpoint due east of your location

43:25.564 --> 43:27.608
in less than 14 hours.

43:42.873 --> 43:47.252
This is not, repeat, not
a teamwork-building assignment.

43:47.336 --> 43:51.798
This test will be timed
and graded on your individual performance.

43:51.882 --> 43:55.761
Each of you will have a walkie-talkie
for use in case of emergency.

43:55.844 --> 43:57.471
But be warned.

43:57.554 --> 44:01.308
Any use of the walkie-talkie
for any reason will abort your test,

44:01.391 --> 44:04.144
and you will receive a failing grade.

44:04.228 --> 44:06.313
And in case I haven’t made this clear...

44:07.856 --> 44:10.442
this is a must-pass test.

44:11.193 --> 44:12.319
Good luck.

44:47.604 --> 44:48.605
[grunts]

44:51.400 --> 44:52.526
[exhales]

44:56.071 --> 44:57.072
[exhales]

45:10.002 --> 45:11.003
[grunts]

45:16.383 --> 45:17.843
Oh, God.

45:20.679 --> 45:23.348
-[water sloshing]
-Oh, God.

45:24.141 --> 45:27.019
[panting]

45:39.907 --> 45:41.074
Got something.

45:49.374 --> 45:50.584
[sighs]

45:50.667 --> 45:54.087
[chattering, laughing]

45:54.171 --> 45:55.172
[grunts]

45:59.009 --> 46:02.888
Congratulations, Cobb.
Your time is ten hours, 12 minutes.

46:03.805 --> 46:05.432
10:12?

46:05.516 --> 46:08.602
Oh. I was hoping I’d break ten.

46:09.645 --> 46:12.814
I guess being number one will have to do.

46:12.898 --> 46:14.358
Didn’t say you were number one.

46:15.275 --> 46:16.360
What?

46:16.443 --> 46:18.570
Hey, Cobb. Catch.

46:20.531 --> 46:23.200
Nine hours, 53 minutes.

46:23.283 --> 46:24.493
Read it and weep.

46:26.787 --> 46:29.081
Well, it’s about time, Doyle.

46:29.164 --> 46:32.543
’Cause I was wondering when you’d get
around to beating me at something.

46:32.626 --> 46:33.627
[clink]

46:33.710 --> 46:34.711
[sighs]

46:37.506 --> 46:38.841
Oh, my God.

47:34.229 --> 47:36.523
-[wind whistling]
-[flapping]

47:59.087 --> 48:00.088
[sighs]

48:03.634 --> 48:04.635
[sighs]

48:04.718 --> 48:05.928
Ellen.

48:11.141 --> 48:12.309
I’m not doing it.

48:14.645 --> 48:15.646
What?

48:17.940 --> 48:20.192
I’m not using the walkie-talkie to abort.

48:23.445 --> 48:24.488
Okay.

48:30.410 --> 48:32.079
I think it’s busted.

48:32.996 --> 48:34.915
I’m not aborting. I won’t fail.

48:34.998 --> 48:36.583
All right. Give me that.

48:37.459 --> 48:39.044
All right. You ready? Breathe.

48:39.127 --> 48:41.004
[Ellen grunts]

48:41.088 --> 48:43.298
There you go. There you go. All right.

48:43.382 --> 48:45.259
-Can you feel this?
-Mm-hmm.

48:45.342 --> 48:46.927
Yeah?

48:47.010 --> 48:48.136
Can you wiggle your toes?

48:50.013 --> 48:51.640
-All right.
-[panting]

48:51.723 --> 48:53.392
It’s probably just a bad sprain.

48:54.518 --> 48:57.187
So we’re gonna get the swelling down.

48:57.271 --> 49:01.984
And then we’re going
to get that boot laced up

49:02.067 --> 49:04.152
as tight as your ankle
can stand it, all right?

49:05.070 --> 49:06.238
Okay.

49:09.408 --> 49:10.409
[sighs]

49:13.287 --> 49:14.288
[sighs]

49:14.371 --> 49:16.415
We’re not gonna get
very far with this sun.

49:23.088 --> 49:24.339
What are you doing?

49:24.423 --> 49:26.592
Something I picked up from Gordo.

49:31.054 --> 49:34.558
[Tracy] All right.
I got you. There you go.

49:34.641 --> 49:36.351
There you go. Get your arm around me.

49:37.311 --> 49:39.062
-All right. I got you.
-Okay.

49:39.146 --> 49:42.274
[Ellen pants, grunts]

49:49.156 --> 49:51.158
[chattering]

49:58.790 --> 50:00.751
-You want some?
-Ma’am? You guys all right?

50:07.090 --> 50:08.091
[sighs]

50:19.520 --> 50:20.729
[grunts]

50:22.272 --> 50:25.025
If we’re both gonna die out here,

50:25.108 --> 50:27.069
I’d at least like to know
who I’m dying with.

50:28.487 --> 50:30.822
Trust me, I’m not that interesting.

50:30.906 --> 50:33.534
Come on, you got anything better to do?

50:33.617 --> 50:35.035
What’d you do before this?

50:38.330 --> 50:42.000
After school, I thought about getting a
job at an engineering firm,

50:42.084 --> 50:47.214
but my dad convinced me to come home and
work for the family business.

50:48.382 --> 50:50.676
What’s the family business?

50:50.759 --> 50:52.594
We’re in air transportation.

50:54.137 --> 50:56.640
All right, take a rest.

50:56.723 --> 51:00.185
Air transportation, huh?
What, like United Airlines?

51:00.269 --> 51:02.855
[chuckles] No.

51:07.317 --> 51:08.443
Cavalier.

51:09.987 --> 51:11.154
Cavalier?

51:12.489 --> 51:14.533
Cavalier Airlines?

51:14.616 --> 51:16.702
“The only way to fly is Cavalier”?

51:18.245 --> 51:19.371
That’s us.

51:25.544 --> 51:26.545
So you’re, uh...

51:27.588 --> 51:28.589
Loaded.

51:29.798 --> 51:31.508
Yeah.

51:31.592 --> 51:34.970
Well. There’s worse things you could be.

51:52.196 --> 51:54.489
[chattering]

51:54.573 --> 51:56.200
[sighs] Time to call it.

51:58.911 --> 52:00.287
This is NASA checkpoint one

52:00.370 --> 52:03.832
to all astronaut candidates
still on the training course.

52:03.916 --> 52:08.253
Your allotted time has elapsed,
and the evaluation is complete.

52:08.337 --> 52:10.214
Radio in with your approximate position

52:10.297 --> 52:12.549
and we’ll get some rescue gear
out to your location.

52:12.633 --> 52:14.551
-Over.
-[static]

52:20.265 --> 52:22.267
[static continues]

52:27.105 --> 52:30.567
This is NASA checkpoint one
to all candidates still on the course.

52:30.651 --> 52:34.613
You are ordered to check in immediately.
Please respond. Over.

52:34.696 --> 52:36.323
[Tracy] Don’t have to shout, Deke.

52:36.406 --> 52:38.617
[panting]

52:38.700 --> 52:39.701
Medics!

52:44.915 --> 52:46.625
This is so embarrassing.

52:48.210 --> 52:50.629
It would’ve been worse
if they carried you out on a stretcher.

52:50.712 --> 52:52.464
-Right?
-[medic] Ma’am, stay there.

52:58.595 --> 52:59.638
Thank you.

53:11.525 --> 53:12.693
[sighs]

53:14.528 --> 53:17.739
[Deke] Not a teamwork exercise,
Stevens. I told you that.

53:17.823 --> 53:20.325
Waverly should’ve called abort,
and you should’ve come in.

53:21.326 --> 53:23.036
Well,

53:23.120 --> 53:25.956
she wouldn’t call abort,
and I wasn’t gonna leave her behind.

53:27.082 --> 53:28.667
Neither would you, sir.

53:39.511 --> 53:40.804
[sighs]

53:49.563 --> 53:50.564
[sighs]

53:58.071 --> 54:00.574
This is bullshit.

54:00.657 --> 54:03.452
Couldn’t have done it without
you nipping at my heels, Cobb.

54:03.535 --> 54:05.454
Girls, look at this.

54:06.330 --> 54:08.373
There’s some letters here.

54:08.457 --> 54:10.501
One for Molly
from a little girl in Munich.

54:11.502 --> 54:12.878
One for me from Tokyo.

54:14.129 --> 54:15.172
Patty.

54:17.424 --> 54:19.843
Cheyenne, Santiago...

54:19.927 --> 54:21.970
Yeah, I don’t need to listen to fan mail.

54:23.639 --> 54:26.391
“Dear Ms. Doyle, what’s
it like being an astronaut?

54:26.475 --> 54:28.560
When I grow up, I wanna go into space.

54:28.644 --> 54:31.772
We hope to see you up in space real soon.

54:31.855 --> 54:33.440
Keep on dreaming.

54:33.524 --> 54:37.110
Love, Lorraine and Janice.”

54:37.194 --> 54:39.112
-[girl 1] “Dear Ms. Waverly.”
-[girl 2] “Dear Danielle.”

54:39.196 --> 54:41.532
“My favorite subject
in school is science.”

54:42.741 --> 54:44.618
[woman 1] “To Mrs. Tracy Stevens,

54:44.701 --> 54:47.913
you have become a big
inspiration in my life.”

54:47.996 --> 54:52.000
[girl 4] “My parents always told me that I
could be anything I wanted when I grow up.

54:52.084 --> 54:55.629
But I never really
believed them till now.”

54:55.712 --> 54:58.590
[woman 2] “One day, I want to travel to
outer space like you’re going to do.”

54:58.674 --> 55:01.552
[girl 6] “I can’t wait to see what
you’ll accomplish at NASA.

55:01.635 --> 55:04.388
-And I look forward to following your...”
-[woman 3] “All the best.”

55:04.471 --> 55:06.390
-“Sincerely.”
-“Best wishes.”

55:06.473 --> 55:07.683
-“Jennifer.”
-“Caroline.”

55:07.766 --> 55:08.851
-“Alyson.”
-“Alicia.”

55:11.395 --> 55:12.396
[knocking]

55:14.815 --> 55:17.276
-You wanted to see me.
-Have a seat.

55:25.242 --> 55:27.202
Got a lot of respect
for what you did out there.

55:27.286 --> 55:30.747
Risking yourself to help another candidate
showed a lot of heart.

55:31.164 --> 55:32.165
Oh.

55:33.834 --> 55:36.503
-It was nothing, sir.
-No, you’re wrong.

55:36.587 --> 55:39.631
Remember, I went through
the same training on Mercury.

55:42.843 --> 55:45.387
Pretty sure Shepard slipped
some rocks in my pack.

55:45.470 --> 55:48.682
-[chuckles]
-But this next stuff we’re doing...

55:50.142 --> 55:53.145
it’s dangerous,
especially the LEM simulator.

55:53.228 --> 55:55.480
You make one mistake in that bedstead...

55:56.982 --> 55:59.193
Yeah, I can handle it.

56:02.154 --> 56:05.866
You just don’t have the skill set, Tracy.

56:06.825 --> 56:08.577
This stuff isn’t like riding a bike.

56:10.787 --> 56:13.874
You should be proud
of what you’ve done so far.

56:14.791 --> 56:15.792
But...

56:17.294 --> 56:18.462
You’re gonna cut me.

56:19.963 --> 56:20.964
No.

56:23.342 --> 56:26.178
I think you should withdraw
from the program.

56:30.432 --> 56:31.433
[mumbles]

56:32.893 --> 56:34.478
I don’t understand.

56:36.063 --> 56:38.440
-You kept me on the list.
-I did.

56:38.524 --> 56:40.025
You showed guts.

56:41.360 --> 56:43.987
But guts isn’t enough, not anymore.

56:49.576 --> 56:51.453
Well, I’m not gonna drop out, Deke.

56:55.582 --> 56:56.667
I want this.

56:58.877 --> 57:01.088
I didn’t know how much until
it was right in front of me,

57:01.171 --> 57:02.381
but I do now.

57:07.010 --> 57:08.011
So.

57:09.638 --> 57:13.559
If you want me out,
you’re gonna have to cut me yourself, sir.

57:28.407 --> 57:30.075
[sighs]

57:31.326 --> 57:33.579
We call this baby “the flying bedstead.”

57:33.662 --> 57:36.957
Its official name is the lunar
landing training vehicle.

57:37.040 --> 57:38.792
The LLTV is designed to emulate

57:38.876 --> 57:41.837
the flight dynamics
of the lunar module spacecraft.

57:41.920 --> 57:46.383
Flies like a helicopter,
but it is not a helicopter.

57:46.466 --> 57:49.761
There are several important distinctions
that y’all need to be aware of

57:49.845 --> 57:51.597
before you take the controls.

57:51.680 --> 57:54.057
See, this is a finicky beast.

57:54.141 --> 57:57.144
Neil Armstrong almost bought the farm
in it a couple years ago.

57:57.227 --> 57:58.896
If he’d ejected two seconds later,

57:58.979 --> 58:02.149
he would not have made it home,
much less to the moon.

58:03.817 --> 58:07.446
The flight plan for today
is basic takeoff and landing maneuvers.

58:07.529 --> 58:10.616
Each of you will fly the bedstead
up to an altitude of 300 feet,

58:10.699 --> 58:12.451
hover for 30 seconds,

58:12.534 --> 58:14.953
execute a 360-degree clockwise spin,

58:15.037 --> 58:16.622
hover for another 30 seconds,

58:16.705 --> 58:19.124
and then land the vehicle
on the landing target.

58:19.208 --> 58:21.502
No frills, nothing fancy.

58:21.585 --> 58:25.297
Just up, hover, spin, hover and land.

58:26.089 --> 58:27.341
-We clear?
-[women] Clear.

58:30.594 --> 58:31.595
Tracy?

58:33.263 --> 58:34.598
[clears throat] Clear, sir.

58:37.226 --> 58:41.063
Flight order. Tracy, Patty,
Ellen, Dani, Molly.

59:11.301 --> 59:16.014
[man] Stand by for liftoff
in three, two, one.

59:22.354 --> 59:24.356
[rock music playing on radio]

59:49.631 --> 59:52.885
[tires squealing]

1:00:01.351 --> 1:00:03.103
Go. Let’s go. Move it out!

1:00:04.980 --> 1:00:09.443
[man] All emergency personnel
report immediately to Flight Ops tarmac.

1:00:09.526 --> 1:00:11.236
Situation red.

1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:16.533
Repeat: All emergency personnel
report immediately to Flight Ops tarmac.

1:00:16.617 --> 1:00:17.910
Situation red.

1:00:17.993 --> 1:00:19.995
[sirens blaring]

1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:25.250
[men shouting]

1:00:27.002 --> 1:00:28.879
-Tracy!
-Gordo, Gordo.

1:00:28.962 --> 1:00:31.215
-Tracy! Tracy.
-No, no. It’s okay.

1:00:32.341 --> 1:00:33.425
[Tracy] Gordo!

1:00:40.307 --> 1:00:42.184
Patty. It was Patty.

1:00:47.439 --> 1:00:49.441
[men shouting]

1:00:56.240 --> 1:00:57.574
[man] Spray it in the middle!
