WEBVTT

01:30.799 --> 01:32.092
Oh...

01:41.643 --> 01:44.229
Marilla, I'd die and go to heaven
if you were to relent

01:44.313 --> 01:46.440
and permit me
to go to Aunt Josephine's party.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.192
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I've said no.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.863
I don't want you becoming overexcited
and taking sick.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.032
Excitement isn't dangerous, Mari...

01:55.115 --> 01:57.075
Anne, please, we've been over this.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.870
Girls your age
shouldn't be going out into society.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.623
You're far too young
to be socializing with adults.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.543
I've never been to a party before.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.963
There will be plenty of time for that
in your long life.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.063
Headache?

02:27.356 --> 02:29.274
You haven't had one in quite a spell.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.318
Don't mention it to Anne.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.904
It'll pass soon, like the others.

02:47.542 --> 02:51.546
I have a strong work ethic, sir,
and I've chosen my vocation.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.759
Medical school, sir.
I know it's for me.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.135
Riveting.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.932
So I was hoping you could offer me
some extra help outside of class,

03:02.015 --> 03:05.852
so that I can catch up,
make up for the time that I missed.

03:11.233 --> 03:14.236
It could also be an opportunity
to prove wrong all those who think

03:14.319 --> 03:16.446
you don't care all that much
about your teaching.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.866
I'm only asking for a small portion
of your time, sir.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.369
Is that all? My time?

03:22.452 --> 03:25.831
Tell me, should your father
simply give his crops away

03:25.914 --> 03:28.667
because someone wants them?
Feels he deserves them?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.461
Hmm? Hmm? He should not.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.672
Time is money, Mr. Blythe.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.926
My father's dead, sir.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.096
Yes.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.556
Well...

03:42.639 --> 03:44.474
the metaphor still plays.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.240
Where were you? I waited.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.454
Father has a cold. We're not going
to Aunt Josephine's party either.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.496
What? But...

04:06.580 --> 04:10.625
Alright, bright little minds,
open your readers.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.295
Let's pick up
from where we last left off.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.216
Isn't it the point of life
to seek what excites you?

04:19.301 --> 04:21.261
I mean, what happens?
Does one smile to death?

04:21.344 --> 04:24.055
My parents and I
have never even been invited before!

04:24.139 --> 04:27.225
But God forbid Father had gone out
with the world's tiniest sniffle!

04:27.309 --> 04:30.729
It's absurd that ladies aren't allowed
to travel without a male companion!

04:30.812 --> 04:32.439
Agreed. And did I mention,

04:32.522 --> 04:35.567
Aunt Josephine is having
a world-renowned pianist perform?

04:35.650 --> 04:36.943
- What?!
- A world...

04:37.027 --> 04:38.403
Ugh!

04:38.653 --> 04:41.239
Cole, what are you do...?
What are you doing?!

04:41.323 --> 04:42.866
- Cole!
- Oh! I...

04:42.949 --> 04:44.284
- Goodness me!
- What are you doing?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.286
- Leave it!
- No! Just wait!

04:46.369 --> 04:47.537
I said leave it!

04:48.163 --> 04:51.166
Cole,
why would you do such a thing?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.962
It should've been better by now.

04:57.964 --> 05:02.594
- It will be. You just need time...
- I got my splint off weeks ago, Anne.

05:02.677 --> 05:06.097
It's just not the same.
I can't draw anymore!

05:06.181 --> 05:08.517
- Cole. It's...
- Cole, please.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.352
- Just...
- Cole...

05:11.102 --> 05:12.771
Just... just wait!

05:13.980 --> 05:14.856
Cole!

05:16.358 --> 05:18.276
Cole, you can't just walk away
from your art...

05:18.360 --> 05:21.988
I don't want to talk about it. Just...

05:24.825 --> 05:28.161
Could this day be any colder
to match our wintry moods?

05:28.954 --> 05:31.456
That's precisely why Aunt Josephine
has her party.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.251
A summer-themed soiree
to chase away the winter gloom.

05:34.334 --> 05:38.838
Oh, could it be more perfect?
It's what we all need. Cole especially.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.093
Cole is a man... Cole is a man!

05:43.176 --> 05:46.054
Diana, what if we could convince
your parents to let Cole

05:46.137 --> 05:48.598
accompany us to Charlottetown?!
Marilla would have to relent!

05:48.682 --> 05:52.477
How can she say a party isn't
for children if you're both going?!

05:52.561 --> 05:54.479
Cole is very tall.

05:54.563 --> 05:59.067
Cole, isn't it just the thing you need
in your time of... deep sadness?

05:59.150 --> 06:03.655
To attend a party...
in a room filled with strangers?

06:03.738 --> 06:06.616
A change of scenery.
Take your mind off...

06:06.700 --> 06:09.411
My folks would never let me
miss a Saturday on the farm.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.709
If I can come up with a plan...
will you do it?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.674
Alright.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.392
The Pen of Duplicity.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.729
Perfect tool for concocting
a most perfect lie.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.482
A fib. For a good cause.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.664
Here. Study your lines carefully.
We only have one chance.

06:54.748 --> 06:58.084
Seeing as Cole has to run an errand
for his parents in Charlottetown...

06:58.168 --> 06:59.753
It makes him the perfect chaperone...

06:59.836 --> 07:03.173
And why is it the Barrys need my son
to go all the way to Charlottetown?

07:03.256 --> 07:06.176
Uh, we're short-staffed at the moment,
so I sugg...

07:06.259 --> 07:08.720
Seeing as Cole has to run an errand
for his parents in...

07:08.803 --> 07:12.265
It makes him the perfect chaperone
to accompany us to the party.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.809
- He'll be compensated, of course.
- Of course.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.354
- You've done errands for your parents?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.356
Nothing feels better than a job well done.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.191
So you're quite a responsible boy?

07:21.274 --> 07:24.069
And you think this errand
could lead to regular paying work?

07:25.487 --> 07:28.698
And now, with Cole and Diana
allowed to go,

07:28.782 --> 07:31.326
as their parents feel a piano concert
will be most educational...

07:31.409 --> 07:34.454
...we were hoping you would reconsider.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.251
I'll leave it to you, Michael.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.089
Matthew.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.226
I'll allow it.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.064
We're going! We're going!

08:01.147 --> 08:02.649
- We're going!
- We're going!

08:02.732 --> 08:04.609
Come! Help me pack!

08:04.693 --> 08:07.278
I couldn't bear it if my puff sleeves
were crushed for the party!

08:09.823 --> 08:14.619
Seeing as how you're feeling poorly,
I... reckon that was the right decision.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.414
- Give you a bit of time to...
- I'm fine.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.040
It's nothing.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.127
Thank the stars
Miss Jeannie gave it back!

09:04.210 --> 09:06.296
Can you imagine if I'd nothing to wear?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.757
- I don't own party clothes.
- It won't matter.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.890
<i>Maybe you'll feel
like getting up tomorrow, Mother.</i>

09:16.973 --> 09:18.058
<i>Rest now.</i>

09:36.993 --> 09:39.120
I already can't wait
to tell you all about it!

09:39.204 --> 09:42.207
I-I left you something
so you don't forget me.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.250
I love you!

09:44.334 --> 09:45.919
Anne!

09:48.797 --> 09:51.132
Let's go!

10:03.311 --> 10:07.690
Welcome, my lovelies.
This will be the scene of the crime.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.737
Oh, goodness me.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.156
Oh!

10:15.240 --> 10:17.867
Oh, I've dreamed about parties before,

10:17.951 --> 10:21.746
and while I do believe I have
quite a capable imagination...

10:21.830 --> 10:24.457
it's never conjured up
anything like this.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.880
I'm exceptionally excited
to hear Cécile Chaminade play.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.759
Miss Barry spares no expense
to get people through the bleak winter.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.970
Oh! How wonderful!

10:37.637 --> 10:41.474
I can't take credit for Gertrude's idea.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.726
This was her night.

10:43.810 --> 10:47.397
I couldn't bring myself
to have this party last year...

10:47.480 --> 10:48.982
without her.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.861
Well, time marches on, doesn't it?

10:55.280 --> 11:00.160
How... did you find yourself
roped into this fiasco?

11:00.243 --> 11:01.995
Cole was our hero.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.747
Without him, we wouldn't have been
permitted to come.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.750
- The artist in you must love all this...
- Anne.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.295
- It's still who you are.
- Not anymore.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.718
I'm happy to be here, even so.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.429
Let's get you some supper.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.681
And then, off to bed.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.809
- Tomorrow is a big day.
- Come on, Cole.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.605
Of all the parties I've been to,
I'm sure this one will be my favorite.

11:34.903 --> 11:38.114
Yes, come in.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.703
Oh, is something the matter, child?

11:44.329 --> 11:45.830
Um...

11:45.914 --> 11:48.374
I've never been...

11:48.458 --> 11:49.959
to a party before,

11:50.043 --> 11:52.754
and I was wondering if you would
please tell me what to expect,

11:52.837 --> 11:55.965
and how I should behave
and how... how should I... be?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.468
You should expect a riotous good time.

11:58.801 --> 12:02.388
And you need not be anyone,
but simply yourself.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.891
Oh, but I have such a history
of doing just that

12:04.974 --> 12:06.935
and getting it all wrong
and not fitting in,

12:07.018 --> 12:08.853
and it seems
I'm not like everyone else...

12:08.937 --> 12:11.356
Then you've come to the correct party.

12:14.150 --> 12:18.154
Jane Eyre! I remember,
you were reading that last year.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.823
Oh, may I borrow it?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.826
I suppose Gertrude wouldn't mind.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.122
Those were her books.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.583
They sit just where she left them.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.424
That's what you meant by...

12:38.508 --> 12:41.094
in your way, you were married.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.971
Yes.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.055
Oh.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.525
I've never read... chapter 10.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.819
It's felt like a hole in my soul.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.322
Must have been one
of her favorite parts.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.158
She could quote many passages
from many authors.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.494
She was a kindred spirit.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.331
She'd always recite something
at this party.

13:10.415 --> 13:13.584
I'd be honored if you would,
on her behalf.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.920
Something you both share a love for?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.009
Oh, good.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.792
There you go, dear.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.419
Diana, come with me. Come.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.214
- How have you been, darling?!
- Oh, I'm so excited for you.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.216
Cécile wants to meet.

14:43.299 --> 14:48.137
Cécile, it was... breathtaking.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.807
Invigorating from start to finish.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.559
I am so thrilled you are pleased,
Miss Barry.

14:53.643 --> 14:57.230
Josephine, please.
And this is my niece, Diana.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.274
I'm delighted to make
your acquaintance, Miss Chaminade.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.443
Magnificent! I'm delighted as well!

15:02.527 --> 15:05.238
- Diana is a budding pianist.
- Ah.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.825
Give her a little glimpse
into your life, won't you?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.994
I see the world,
sharing my compositions everywhere I go.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.664
It is an incredible life,

15:14.747 --> 15:17.667
if you don't mind hard work...
and travel.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.753
Is it something that you aspire to,
Diana?

15:21.337 --> 15:23.506
- Aspire to?
- With your music.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.259
A career, dear. Your piano.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.178
Oh. Well... no.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.265
I suppose I could keep it up
on a recreational basis.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.308
If it were agreeable to my husband.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.935
Look around, dear.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.479
Despite what you've been told,

15:38.563 --> 15:41.649
your life doesn't have to be
an exact replica of your parents'.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.860
- <i>True!</i>
- Marriage is wonderful,

15:43.943 --> 15:46.070
if love is why you marry.

15:46.154 --> 15:50.074
But perhaps you'd like something more
than simply keeping a house.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.701
I-I...

15:51.784 --> 15:53.953
You must play something for us,
<i>ma chérie.</i>

15:54.036 --> 15:56.747
Oh, no, I-I'm not...

15:57.498 --> 15:59.876
Excuse me. Uh... lovely to meet you.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.586
Ahem.

16:05.173 --> 16:06.716
Excuse me.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.967
Oh!

16:08.801 --> 16:10.178
Excuse me.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.942
Oh! Uh, I'm-I'm so sorry.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.611
I love your pixie haircut.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.489
Style, not sincerity!

16:39.248 --> 16:40.625
Thank you.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.516
Well... what do we have here?

16:57.475 --> 17:00.520
A farm boy!
You must be a farm boy.

17:00.603 --> 17:03.689
- A sad farm boy.
- Dressed in brown.

17:03.773 --> 17:07.359
Sometimes I think I'd like
to pack it all in and be a farmer.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.944
The simple life.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.448
The day starts when the sun comes up
and ends when it goes down.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.575
- Then why are you so sad, farm boy?
- I...

17:14.659 --> 17:16.117
It must be the brown.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.997
You, young sir, are not at all dressed
for a summer soiree.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.375
- Oh. Oh.
- Ah.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.173
Voila!

17:33.052 --> 17:36.973
Diana, isn't this just the most amazing
group of people?

17:38.140 --> 17:40.851
- I don't know what to think.
- Me neither!

17:44.146 --> 17:46.065
I suppose I should go practice.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.198
Excuse me.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.576
Ex-excuse me.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.912
Ex-excuse me!

18:01.080 --> 18:04.584
Could you help an old blossom out
and get me a drink?

18:04.667 --> 18:06.627
I seem to be stuck down here.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.296
Oh, why, certainly.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.640
I guess I went a little overboard.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.602
Oh, no, you've made my day.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.146
I've been conversing with flowers
my whole life,

18:25.229 --> 18:28.065
and it's the first time
that one has spoken aloud.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.859
Happy I could be of some service.

18:34.822 --> 18:35.990
Oh...

18:44.206 --> 18:45.207
Good evening.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.962
I'm thrilled
to be among your lovely faces...

18:50.963 --> 18:53.215
but we feel the absence of one.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.010
What a face it was.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.013
I still recall it,
peering over my shoulder,

18:59.096 --> 19:02.099
reading over my shoulder,
no care for decorum.

19:02.183 --> 19:05.227
That's how we met.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.855
A bookshop in Paris.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.399
A woman introduces herself as Gertrude

19:10.483 --> 19:14.153
and tells me I do not want to purchase
the book I'm perusing,

19:14.236 --> 19:18.574
as it's impossibly bleak and,
in the end, the protagonist is murdered!

19:18.658 --> 19:20.660
Well...

19:20.743 --> 19:24.914
I spent my next decades
hiding what I was reading,

19:24.997 --> 19:28.292
as she couldn't help but spoil
the ending of every novel...

19:28.376 --> 19:30.044
or night at the theatre.

19:30.127 --> 19:34.006
She also attempted to bleed me dry,

19:34.090 --> 19:36.258
spending all my money on the arts.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.761
And look what I'm left with.

19:39.512 --> 19:43.891
Nothing but a room
full of the most wonderful friends.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.977
To Gertrude.

19:47.853 --> 19:51.732
May she be reading over our shoulders
for eternity.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.234
To the most wonderful couple.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.903
My romantic ideal.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.281
- Gertie and Jo.
- Hear, hear!

19:59.365 --> 20:01.450
- Thank you.
- Gertie and Jo.

20:07.581 --> 20:10.710
And now, to give a recitation
in Gertrude's stead,

20:10.793 --> 20:13.087
I invite the always surprising,

20:13.170 --> 20:16.841
bright-eyed, big-brained
Anne Shirley-Cuthbert.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.390
Anne fits right in, doesn't she?

20:27.518 --> 20:30.604
"Now I remember
that the real world was wide,

20:30.688 --> 20:34.483
and that a varied field
of hopes and fears,

20:34.567 --> 20:37.945
of sensations and excitements,

20:38.028 --> 20:41.323
awaited those who had the courage
to go forth...

20:41.407 --> 20:43.075
into its expanse,

20:43.826 --> 20:46.537
to seek real knowledge of life...

20:46.620 --> 20:49.457
amidst its perils."

21:00.134 --> 21:01.635
- Oh.
- No.

21:01.719 --> 21:03.971
- Excuse me.
- No, no. No.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.015
Come. Sit.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.230
Gertrude loved my tears.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.153
She felt so openly.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.572
Hmm. Put me to shame.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.451
I was raised to keep everything
buttoned up inside.

21:25.534 --> 21:29.747
But she had this extraordinary range
of emotions.

21:30.748 --> 21:35.461
Life... had so many colors
through her eyes.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.923
It painted my world forever.

21:40.007 --> 21:43.928
She was the first person
with whom I didn't have to hide.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.597
That sounds...

21:48.390 --> 21:50.351
- like a miracle.
- Mm...

21:50.768 --> 21:52.645
I wish I had met your Gertrude.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.901
This was one of her favorites.

22:07.910 --> 22:11.038
Would you... like to dance... Miss...

22:11.789 --> 22:13.082
Josephine.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.293
And I suspect I would.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.943
- Shall we?
- Yes.

22:49.243 --> 22:50.953
Marilla...

22:51.036 --> 22:52.955
can we get you into bed?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.999
I'm just fine, thank you.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.005
Have you had anything to eat?

23:01.088 --> 23:02.339
No.

23:02.756 --> 23:03.841
No?

23:04.967 --> 23:06.343
I'll fetch you something.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.345
Don't go to the trouble.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.764
No, no, no. No trouble.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.311
Marilla?! Are you alright?!

23:58.145 --> 23:59.563
Oh...

23:59.647 --> 24:02.358
Are you hurt?

24:02.441 --> 24:05.402
No. No, no, no, don't make a fuss.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.367
- Oh.
- No, no, let me help you.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.254
<i>Mother?</i>

24:26.924 --> 24:28.175
Open, please.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.430
Please, Mother?

24:34.348 --> 24:35.474
Please?

24:41.772 --> 24:45.776
- Why won't she get out of bed?
- She can't help it. She misses Michael.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.862
But it's been a year.
Doesn't she love us too?

24:48.946 --> 24:51.281
Of course. How could she not?

25:02.459 --> 25:04.753
Go on downstairs and be of use.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.548
Go on downstairs now.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.479
What if something is truly wrong?

25:25.232 --> 25:27.943
- You've had these headaches before.
- It's different this time.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.862
How so? Is it worse?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.239
Shall I fetch a doctor?

25:32.823 --> 25:34.575
It's different, because before,

25:34.658 --> 25:37.661
if-if I went blind,
or-or... wound up an invalid,

25:37.745 --> 25:39.663
it wouldn't have mattered.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.790
Now there's Anne to think of.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.417
You listen now.

25:43.500 --> 25:47.296
You're having some pain,
but you'll get better. You always do.

25:47.880 --> 25:52.301
This isn't what put Mother in the bed,
even though she complained of it.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.052
Hers was melancholia and...

25:54.136 --> 25:55.804
I couldn't bear it if...

25:55.888 --> 25:59.975
I can't. I won't be a burden to Anne.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.316
Rest now. This'll pass.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.568
It will.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.730
Isn't it just the most remarkable
of evenings?

26:56.532 --> 26:58.534
What do you suppose
that woman in the hat meant

26:58.617 --> 27:03.038
when she said that Aunt Josephine
and Gertrude were her romantic ideal?

27:03.956 --> 27:05.958
Oh, well, they were in love!

27:06.875 --> 27:09.336
Isn't it ever so sad to see
what Aunt Josephine lost,

27:09.419 --> 27:11.880
but it's lovely to see
what a life they had together?

27:14.967 --> 27:18.554
No. I've known Aunt Josephine
and Aunt Gertrude my whole life.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.973
They... they can't have...

27:22.474 --> 27:23.851
They weren't.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.285
Oh, how wonderful!

28:35.714 --> 28:37.257
<i>I don't know what you do</i>

28:37.341 --> 28:39.509
<i>to keep popping this button off.
Matthew!</i>

28:39.593 --> 28:42.596
Both hands.
Now eat quickly or we'll be late.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.933
- I can't go if I don't have a shirt.
- I said I'd fix it and I will!

28:46.016 --> 28:47.935
I don't have time to argue!

28:48.018 --> 28:50.270
I need to bring Mother her tray.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.522
Matthew! I just scrubbed the floor!

28:52.606 --> 28:56.652
<i>How many times must I tell you
to change your boots outside?</i>

29:03.367 --> 29:04.743
Marilla?

29:10.082 --> 29:11.959
Tell me what you think of this?

29:13.752 --> 29:16.380
It makes me feel not so alone.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.259
Like... whoever made it...

29:20.342 --> 29:22.678
truly understands sorrow.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.138
- I suppose I do.
- This is yours?!

29:25.222 --> 29:27.432
It's wonderful!

29:27.516 --> 29:29.935
The gracefulness of the composition
and...

29:30.018 --> 29:33.146
Well, if our young farm boy
isn't an artist.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.106
Was.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.694
I broke it.
I can't... control the pencil.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.989
I can't draw the way I used to.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.409
- It was...
- It was everything to you.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.621
That's the sublime thing about art.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.708
One gets to take moments of hardship
and heartbreak,

29:52.791 --> 29:55.127
and channel them into something
that makes a sad boy

29:55.210 --> 29:57.212
feel less alone at a party.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.840
Art, the ability to make it,

29:59.923 --> 30:03.427
gives meaning to sadness in a way
that many aren't able to experience.

30:03.510 --> 30:06.638
Cole! Have you seen Diana?

30:06.722 --> 30:08.724
We were dancing and she disappeared.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.769
What I'm saying is,
there is no straight path in art or life.

30:12.853 --> 30:16.106
Sometimes there's no path at all
and one must break down walls

30:16.189 --> 30:19.818
and machete their way through the woods
to get where they need to go.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.570
Oh, my.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.822
Have you ever heard a thing
said for the first time,

30:23.905 --> 30:26.074
yet it made such magnificent sense,

30:26.158 --> 30:29.328
it's as if you'd been waiting to hear it
all your life?

30:30.746 --> 30:32.164
Anne, is it?

30:32.247 --> 30:33.832
Yes. With an E.

30:33.915 --> 30:37.377
You... have a beautiful connection
to words.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.088
Know that. Do something with it.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.466
Go where your passion leads you.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.096
Try clay, Cole the artist.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.973
It'll strengthen your wrist.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.809
And who knows, you may fall in love.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.395
Your art isn't lost.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.606
It never will be.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.617
I'm going to trade my puff sleeves
for a top hat.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.620
Or maybe I'll wear them together!
Because maybe that is me.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.538
I think it might be.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.291
Oh, and Diana, Cécile Chaminade,

31:16.375 --> 31:20.295
did she inspire you to play and play
and play some more?

31:21.797 --> 31:24.132
Aunt Josephine
kept her lifestyle a secret.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.842
My parents certainly don't know.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.303
That... must mean it's wrong.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.105
"To my Gertrude.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.440
Someone will remember us,

31:40.524 --> 31:43.735
I say, even in another time.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.530
Forever you have my heart.

31:46.613 --> 31:47.906
Jo."

31:48.532 --> 31:51.660
Two women could never have children.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.663
- It doesn't make sense.
- How can you say that,

31:54.746 --> 31:57.916
when such beautiful words
were written from one to another?

31:57.999 --> 31:59.626
It's unnatural, Anne!

32:01.545 --> 32:06.341
If your aunt lived her life feeling
something was wrong with her,

32:06.425 --> 32:09.469
that she was... broken, defective,

32:09.553 --> 32:11.430
or unnatural...

32:12.097 --> 32:13.432
then one day,

32:13.515 --> 32:17.519
she met someone
that made her realize that wasn't true,

32:18.687 --> 32:20.564
there was nothing wrong with her,

32:20.647 --> 32:22.774
and she was... fine...

32:24.609 --> 32:26.486
shouldn't we be happy for her?

32:26.570 --> 32:28.780
I think it's spectacular.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.367
There's so much more possibility.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.195
You look lighter.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.490
I had a lovely time at the party
last night.

33:11.573 --> 33:12.616
As did I.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.995
I want to thank you
for allowing me to, uh...

33:17.412 --> 33:19.623
to remember with you last night.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.545
Diana and her parents
didn't know about...

33:26.296 --> 33:28.757
the way things were
between you and Gertrude.

33:29.549 --> 33:33.553
You must have known,
them coming here, they'd find out...

33:33.637 --> 33:36.640
They will think of it what they will.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.810
Doesn't it just take the ending
of someone's life

33:40.894 --> 33:44.689
to teach you that life is short
and you only have one?

33:45.065 --> 33:45.982
Hmm.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.194
I think I'm like you and Gertrude.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.660
You have a life of such joy before you.

33:56.743 --> 34:00.455
Not without hardship.
Not without bumps in the road.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.750
Be safe with those you trust.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.920
But when you do find people to trust,

34:07.003 --> 34:09.797
the bond will be that much greater.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.510
I'm quite touched...
by you choosing me as one.

34:15.262 --> 34:16.679
Rollings?

34:18.181 --> 34:21.726
In case your parents ask
about this "compensation."

34:22.476 --> 34:24.103
I... couldn't.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.063
I'll not hear protest.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.404
Well...

34:33.862 --> 34:34.822
thank you...

34:34.906 --> 34:38.118
Now, let's rouse those girls,
or you'll miss your train!

34:40.996 --> 34:43.623
No, no, that's just, um...

34:43.706 --> 34:45.625
that's just sugar.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.509
Egg, egg.

35:14.863 --> 35:17.657
I, uh,
I couldn't remember what you took.

35:17.741 --> 35:20.785
- I didn't ask you to bring...
- Oh, for goodness sake, Marilla!

35:20.869 --> 35:22.621
Ju-just let me help you!

35:22.704 --> 35:25.707
You just can't lie up here
thinking terrible thoughts

35:25.790 --> 35:27.500
and not let me try
to do anything for you!

35:27.584 --> 35:29.836
- I don't need...
- No, it's the least I can do!

35:29.919 --> 35:32.339
It's my fault, too! It wasn't just her!

35:32.422 --> 35:33.757
Uh, who?

35:33.840 --> 35:35.258
Mother!

35:36.343 --> 35:39.888
- You've lost me.
- That you were robbed of your life,

35:39.971 --> 35:43.475
your possibilities,
it wasn't just by her, it was me.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.143
I mean, I needed you.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.646
And you had to stay here
and take care of me. Otherwise...

35:47.729 --> 35:49.898
Otherwise nothing.

35:50.565 --> 35:53.902
You think I feel an ounce of regret
about that?

35:53.985 --> 35:57.530
It's been you and me, all these years.

35:59.199 --> 36:01.034
She didn't choose what overtook her.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.411
- She didn't choose to fight it.
- She'd lost a child!

36:03.495 --> 36:05.246
She had other children!

36:13.380 --> 36:15.840
No one can understand
what that must've been like.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.010
We all lost Michael.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.514
And you lost Michael,

36:22.597 --> 36:26.184
and you got up every morning
and you raised me.

36:27.811 --> 36:29.396
And you will do that for Anne,

36:29.479 --> 36:33.024
because you are stronger
than our mother.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.951
I think sometimes...

36:43.034 --> 36:45.328
if things had been different,

36:46.204 --> 36:49.040
if she'd forced herself,
if she'd been able to...

36:53.211 --> 36:57.382
I suppose I hardened some... to cope.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.844
Hmm. And I suppose I...

37:01.553 --> 37:03.430
I shut down, as well.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.017
Look at us... gabbing on.

37:14.441 --> 37:17.485
I suppose a certain redhead...

37:17.569 --> 37:19.446
might be, uh...

37:20.864 --> 37:23.908
reversing some of those effects.

37:24.868 --> 37:25.869
But listen now.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.330
Whatever we're facing,

37:29.414 --> 37:31.416
we'll face it as a family...

37:32.375 --> 37:33.877
the three of us.

37:52.896 --> 37:55.023
Thank you! Farewell!

38:05.492 --> 38:07.702
I don't even know where to start!

38:07.786 --> 38:09.537
It went well, then?

38:09.621 --> 38:12.207
"Well" doesn't even begin to explain it!

38:12.290 --> 38:15.960
It was the most wonderful ti...

38:16.711 --> 38:19.631
- Where's Marilla?
- Oh, she's in bed.

38:19.714 --> 38:23.092
She's under the weather.
Just a bit, I mean. Not to worry.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.137
I know she'd love to see you.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.566
I won't disturb you, Marilla.
I just wanted to see you.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.235
Come in. Please.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.945
It's only a headache.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.827
- What happened?
- Oh, a little mishap. It's nothing.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.455
Thank you for the portrait.

38:52.539 --> 38:55.333
I still missed you very much,
but it helped.

38:56.084 --> 38:58.169
- You missed me?
- I did.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.213
Now...

39:00.755 --> 39:02.423
tell me everything.

39:02.507 --> 39:05.718
Was it an adventure?
Perhaps you could speak it quietly?

39:06.553 --> 39:07.679
Oh.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.683
Oh, Marilla, it was indeed a dream.

39:11.766 --> 39:15.186
Everyone was so smart and interesting.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.273
It felt as though
you could be any way in the world,

39:18.356 --> 39:19.983
and there might be a place for you.

39:20.066 --> 39:23.236
- That sounds lovely.
- Oh, you would adore it!

39:23.319 --> 39:25.321
Oh, and...

39:26.573 --> 39:28.575
Oh. Well, well.

39:28.658 --> 39:33.121
Everyone wore them,
from the most proper gentleman to...

39:33.204 --> 39:35.832
well... me.

39:40.837 --> 39:43.256
Don't think you can take advantage of me
in my weakened state.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.219
Well, now... I feel better already.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.391
I think I learned some things
about love, too.

39:54.017 --> 39:58.938
It doesn't look the same for everyone.
It can come in so many forms.

39:59.022 --> 40:01.649
And how can there be anything wrong
with a life

40:01.733 --> 40:04.736
if it's spent with a person you love?

40:14.203 --> 40:16.414
Well, I don't think
I can argue with that.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.434
<i>"I remembered
that the real world was wide,</i>

40:36.517 --> 40:40.188
<i>and that a varied field of hopes
and fears,</i>

40:40.271 --> 40:42.565
<i>of sensations and excitements</i>

40:42.649 --> 40:46.402
<i>awaited those who had the courage
to go forth...</i>

40:46.486 --> 40:48.279
<i>into its expanse...</i>

40:50.490 --> 40:54.786
<i>to seek real knowledge of life
amidst its perils."</i>

40:57.664 --> 41:02.210
Isn't that the most perfectly inspiring
composition of words?

41:02.293 --> 41:05.880
Aunt Josephine asked me
to read it aloud at the party and I did!

41:06.881 --> 41:10.677
Well, I-I can't seem to tell you
whether it was word perfect or not.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.681
There's no shame in reading glasses,
Marilla.

41:14.889 --> 41:17.767
Straining the eyes
can give you terrible headaches.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.729
I suppose I'll have to see an oculist.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.108
No jokes about my age,
thank you very much.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.986
<i>And a word or phrase</i>

41:28.069 --> 41:29.988
that makes specific

41:30.071 --> 41:33.866
the meaning of another word or phrase?

41:36.995 --> 41:39.414
Perhaps the good doctor
can tell us the answer.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.254
The answer is modifier, sir.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.966
And I managed to learn that
with no extra time from you.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.137
Correct.

41:59.934 --> 42:01.728
- Bye, Anne.
- Bye, Ruby.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.610
The good doctor?

42:10.778 --> 42:12.947
Someday, I... hope I get there.

42:13.031 --> 42:15.867
In the meantime,
feels good to know what I want.

42:17.535 --> 42:21.372
You'll get there, if you...
go where your passions lead you.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.893
Ah. Hello.

42:41.976 --> 42:42.977
Hello.

42:53.988 --> 42:56.616
Gilbert may know
just want he wants to be,

42:56.699 --> 42:59.285
but does he have a beautiful connection
to words?

42:59.994 --> 43:01.662
I don't think so.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.333
I thought you said
that was the Pen of Duplicity.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.170
Yes, but I think
it's been properly exorcized.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.216
- Hmm.
- Are you going to be a writer?

43:15.009 --> 43:17.970
Maybe. Maybe I'll be a lot of things.

43:22.183 --> 43:26.229
I now dub thee
the Pen of Possibility.
