WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:05.667
Custodian Brock,

00:05.750 --> 00:08.166
<i>report to the cafeteria immediately.</i>

00:08.250 --> 00:09.166
<i>The rats have...</i>

00:09.250 --> 00:10.583
taken control of the fro-yo bar.

00:10.709 --> 00:13.375
Be advised,
those are not chocolate sprinkles.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.834
I hate my life.

00:19.834 --> 00:22.875
I love my life. Whoo!

00:24.333 --> 00:28.041
Mm, this cocoa could use a little heat.

00:39.208 --> 00:41.291
Ah! Just right.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.667
Dude, why'd you text us
to meet you in the boiler room?

00:44.750 --> 00:46.375
They're handing out
the new MyPads the school won.

00:46.458 --> 00:48.458
I can't believe
we had the highest test scores

00:48.542 --> 00:50.333
- out of any school in the district.
- I know.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.625
Just so you know,
I'm the reason we won those MyPads.

00:52.709 --> 00:55.208
- You are?
- Yeah, I stayed home on test day.

00:55.834 --> 00:57.917
Yeah, you did do that. Thank you.

00:58.834 --> 00:59.792
So what's up?

00:59.875 --> 01:03.166
Ah, Mr. Roper combined two chemicals
that he shouldn't have.

01:03.250 --> 01:06.458
Now the whole science lab
smells like wet cat and rotten eggs.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.875
You sure that's not just Mr. Roper?

01:09.667 --> 01:10.834
Oh, it might be.

01:10.917 --> 01:14.000
Either way, those kids are suffering
and we got to clear that stink.

01:14.083 --> 01:16.333
Well, how can we help from down here?

01:16.417 --> 01:17.917
Oh, Kim.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.125
This is the nerve center of our school.

01:20.208 --> 01:22.959
These valves, gauges, and switches
control everything.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.542
Jerry, since when do you know things?

01:25.625 --> 01:27.083
It's in my blood.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.417
I come from a long line
of electricians, plumbers,

01:29.500 --> 01:30.792
and fortune tellers.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.750
Jack, you will have a happy life
filled with great accomplishments.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.667
What about me?

01:37.458 --> 01:39.041
We should probably get to work.

01:40.625 --> 01:42.709
Okay, when I say now,

01:42.792 --> 01:44.583
Jack, you're gonna turn that valve.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.250
Kim, you're gonna pull that handle.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.291
And I will drop this lever.

01:48.375 --> 01:49.250
You ready?

01:49.625 --> 01:51.250
And now.

01:57.250 --> 02:00.125
We didn't just de-stink the lab, did we?

02:00.208 --> 02:02.250
No.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.166
I hate that laugh.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.834
What did we just do?

02:08.166 --> 02:09.458
Oh! Oh!

02:10.417 --> 02:12.917
Oh, Martinez!

Just give it to me straight.
I can handle it.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.917
I'm sorry. We lost her, sir.

03:01.041 --> 03:02.917
No!

03:05.083 --> 03:07.125
Oh! I can't believe she's gone.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.375
She saw a side of me few ever did.

03:13.709 --> 03:15.834
Man, look at this place.

03:15.917 --> 03:17.709
You got your own massage chair,

03:17.792 --> 03:19.458
flat screen TV,

03:19.542 --> 03:21.083
sweet pool table.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.083
Solid man cave, Funderburk.

03:24.333 --> 03:27.125
There are some days I walk around
in a leopard skin--

03:27.542 --> 03:29.375
It's Principal Funderburk!

03:31.542 --> 03:33.834
You three just bought yourselves

03:33.917 --> 03:35.917
a ticket to Saturday detention.

03:39.041 --> 03:40.709
I'm gonna personally supervise

03:40.792 --> 03:44.208
while you clean every bathroom
in the school starting with mine.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.458
- What? That's not fair. Jack and I--
- Can it, sister.

03:46.542 --> 03:48.750
- We thought we were cleaning the--
- I said can it, sister.

03:50.166 --> 03:52.375
You want to be friends
with Jerry Martinez,

03:52.458 --> 03:53.375
you pay the price.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.625
Oh, one more thing.

03:56.542 --> 03:59.291
You three will not be getting MyPads.

03:59.375 --> 04:00.959
What?
- That's right.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.333
You just cost yourselves

04:02.417 --> 04:05.041
a state-of-the-art
educational learning tool.

04:05.709 --> 04:07.333
It will also let you do this.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.583
What's up now?

04:11.667 --> 04:14.375
I love this app.

04:18.709 --> 04:21.375
Rudy, thanks for taking me
on this space center tour.

04:21.458 --> 04:24.458
It's my dream to one day attend
the space program here.

04:24.542 --> 04:27.083
It's my dream to get another
bag of this Jupiter Jerky.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.458
It is off the hinges!

04:29.542 --> 04:33.625
Up next, we're going to experience
what it's like to be weightless.

04:33.709 --> 04:36.709
Wait, we're going to actually
experience zero gravity?

04:36.792 --> 04:39.625
No. You're going to experience
a large man named Tito

04:39.709 --> 04:41.750
picking you up by your belt
and spinning you around.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.291
So come on in. It's your turn, guys.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.250
Rudy, what are you doing?

05:01.333 --> 05:03.959
What, dude, all of the cool stuff
is behind the scenes.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.125
Look, I have it on very good authority

05:06.208 --> 05:08.959
that somewhere in here
is a biochamber that houses aliens.

05:09.667 --> 05:11.750
Oh, really? What authority?

05:11.834 --> 05:14.625
I don't have to tell you my authority,
but trust me.

05:14.709 --> 05:18.792
He is a highly-placed government official
with access to classified information.

05:18.875 --> 05:21.667
It's the guy in the park with the pigeon
living in his beard, isn't it?

05:21.750 --> 05:23.250
Yes. Yes, it is.

05:26.083 --> 05:27.959
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

05:30.917 --> 05:33.417
Where's Jerry?
Shouldn't he be here by now?

05:33.458 --> 05:36.500
He's always around to get us in trouble,
but never around to get us out.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.166
What's that noise?

05:42.250 --> 05:44.250
That's something rattling
in the boiler room.

05:44.333 --> 05:47.125
Because of your prank, we had to drain
all the water from the pipes.

05:48.208 --> 05:49.208
<i>Wait, no.</i>

05:49.250 --> 05:52.000
I'm telling you, Donna.
You're the only girl for me.

05:53.166 --> 05:54.542
Oh, you're going out with Brad?

05:54.625 --> 05:56.208
Hey, do you have Kerri Davis' number?

05:56.625 --> 05:58.083
- Hello?
-

05:58.166 --> 06:00.291
Well, glad you could make it, Jerry.

06:01.291 --> 06:02.792
Phone me, guys.

06:08.750 --> 06:11.125
Okay, Martinez. Now jump up and down.

06:20.375 --> 06:21.875
I hope you're happy, Jerry.

06:21.959 --> 06:23.667
Okay, Saturdays are the day
I go to the mall

06:23.750 --> 06:26.000
to get free make-up
by pretending to buy make-up.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.917
You really messed up this time, Jerry.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.959
You cost us our weekend
and we're not getting our MyPads.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.875
Oh, come on, guys. I'm sorry.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.750
You got to admit it was
really funny though, right?

06:39.625 --> 06:41.542
Maybe Funderburk's right.

06:41.625 --> 06:43.709
Maybe being your friend
just isn't worth it.

06:43.792 --> 06:45.041
Come on, Kim.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.083
Let's go clean any bathroom
Jerry's not in.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.000
What...

06:49.125 --> 06:51.250
Oh, come on, guys. Don't be like that.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.917
You're my best friends.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.208
-
- Oh.

06:54.291 --> 06:56.208
Oh, so you're just gonna leave me here.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.250
Fine.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.500
You know, I'll just clean
this entire place by my...

06:59.583 --> 07:01.750
Ooh, nice pool table.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.834
I'm gonna hit the six ball,
kiss it off the five.

07:08.917 --> 07:11.000
That'll run down the sideline
and knock the two

07:11.083 --> 07:12.417
into the corner pocket.

07:13.208 --> 07:15.542
Or really whatever ball goes in
is what I meant to do.

07:41.792 --> 07:43.083
Ooh.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.917
I think this is an alien biochamber.

07:50.333 --> 07:53.834
Hello, alien life forms.

07:54.542 --> 07:59.083
Should you be green and flabby
or large-headed,

07:59.166 --> 08:01.583
we shan't laugh at your appearance,

08:01.667 --> 08:03.834
for we come in peace.

08:05.959 --> 08:08.000
Rudy, this isn't an alien biochamber.

08:13.959 --> 08:16.667
-
- Let me turn on a light.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.917
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen!

08:22.000 --> 08:23.834
The inside of the Lunar Shuttle!

08:23.917 --> 08:26.250
Dude, dude, take a picture of me.

08:29.125 --> 08:30.792
Look, look, look.

08:30.875 --> 08:32.375
I'm flying it with my butt.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.083
What did you do?

08:37.166 --> 08:39.208
My butt did it! It has a mind of its own.

08:39.542 --> 08:44.166
<i>Launch sequence
initiated in three, two, one...</i>

08:44.250 --> 08:46.083
You... you activated the shuttle!

08:46.166 --> 08:48.834
I don't believe it. We're going to space!

08:48.917 --> 08:50.125
- What!
-

08:54.583 --> 08:57.125
Oh. Holy Christmas nuts!

08:57.208 --> 08:59.625
Goodbye, sweet Mother Earth!

09:12.667 --> 09:14.166
<i>What do you think
you're doing?</i>

09:14.250 --> 09:15.542
<i>You'll never get away with this.</i>

09:16.959 --> 09:18.125
Funderburk?

09:18.208 --> 09:19.583
<i>No. No, not that.</i>

09:19.667 --> 09:21.333
- <i>Get away from me!</i>
-

09:23.000 --> 09:24.542
<i>Get away from me.</i>

09:24.625 --> 09:26.166
<i>Please don't hurt me.</i>

09:26.250 --> 09:28.792
<i>No! Stop that!</i>

09:33.083 --> 09:35.458
- You'll never get away with this.
- Come on. Let us go.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.500
We've all seen your face, okay.

09:39.583 --> 09:41.000
<i>We'll just report it.</i>

09:41.083 --> 09:42.083
<i>How could you do this?</i>

09:42.166 --> 09:44.083
These MyPads are for the students.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.166
They're great.
I bought one for my mother-in-law

09:46.250 --> 09:48.375
just to get her off my back.

09:48.458 --> 09:52.000
That woman's a talker.
She just goes on and on and on

09:52.083 --> 09:53.250
- and on--
- Shut it!

09:54.583 --> 09:55.750
Fine.

09:55.834 --> 09:58.041
Now you're not gonna get
to hear the end of the story.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.917
These MyPads are worth
a quarter of a million dollars.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.917
They're my retirement plan.

10:04.000 --> 10:04.917
Wait a minute.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.875
What are you guys doing here
on a Saturday?

10:06.959 --> 10:09.667
Giving detention to these bowl busters.

10:15.250 --> 10:16.291
Get down.

10:17.750 --> 10:18.917
Get down!

10:21.166 --> 10:22.333
Sorry, um...

10:22.667 --> 10:25.583
Um, when we get nervous, we, uh...

10:26.291 --> 10:27.291
<i>Um...</i>

10:27.375 --> 10:28.834
- We... we sing.
- Sing.

10:28.917 --> 10:30.083
It's our thing, you know.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.375
<i>♪ Get down ♪</i>

10:34.917 --> 10:36.542
- <i>♪ Boogie fever ♪</i>

10:36.625 --> 10:37.667
I love that song.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.667
<i>♪ Get down, oh, yeah ♪</i>

10:39.750 --> 10:42.125

10:53.458 --> 10:55.542
Brock doesn't know
that Jerry's still in the building.

10:55.625 --> 10:56.792
So we got that going for us.

10:56.875 --> 10:58.542
<i>Yo, Brock, it's Jerry.</i>

10:58.625 --> 11:00.834
<i>I am in the building.</i>

11:02.417 --> 11:04.750
<i>I'm in the principal's bathroom
if you want me.</i>

11:04.834 --> 11:06.041
<i>Whoo! Whoa!</i>

11:06.125 --> 11:07.542
<i>Hot mic. Hot mic.</i>

11:07.625 --> 11:08.750
<i>So sorry.</i>

11:10.291 --> 11:13.083
I had a nice, relaxing weekend
robbery planned.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.333
And you guys ruined it!

11:21.166 --> 11:22.750
- Guys.
Jerry.

11:22.834 --> 11:23.750
Did you call the police?

11:23.834 --> 11:24.667
No, I couldn't.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.375
He crashed
the whole communications system.

11:26.458 --> 11:28.959
Uh, computers, phones,
the whole network's down.

11:30.208 --> 11:31.625
You know, Funderburk I get.

11:31.709 --> 11:33.500
He's kind of flabby and physically weak.

11:33.583 --> 11:34.834
I'm right here.

11:35.625 --> 11:38.208
But you and Kim are both black belts.

11:38.291 --> 11:40.000
How did Brock take both you guys down?

11:40.083 --> 11:42.750
Because it turns out that
Brock's not your average custodian.

11:42.834 --> 11:45.667
He's the Heinous Hyena,
the toughest cage fighter that ever lived.

11:45.750 --> 11:47.542
I was his biggest fan.

11:47.625 --> 11:50.125
In fact, I was there
on his last night when he snapped...

11:50.792 --> 11:52.458
the referee in two.

11:54.542 --> 11:57.959
He was kicked out of the league
and I hired him here.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.875
Jerry, you have to go get help.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.625
There's no way
you can stop this guy alone.

12:02.709 --> 12:06.959
No. No, I'm not leaving you here
with some deranged cage fighter.

12:07.458 --> 12:09.834
I got you into this mess
and I'm gonna get you guys out.

12:11.458 --> 12:13.417
I was a member of Hyena's Herd.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.375
Yeah, every time he'd drop the hammer,

12:16.458 --> 12:19.417
I'd stand up on my chair
and I'd give the call of the Hyena.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.417
It was a lonely time in my life.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.959
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

12:40.792 --> 12:42.959
Wait a second. Why am I screaming?

12:43.041 --> 12:46.458
Because that's what people tend to do
when they're hurling through space

12:46.542 --> 12:48.333
towards their inevitable doom.

12:50.375 --> 12:51.917
Oh, it's a pretty comet.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.000
How come we're not weightless?

12:57.792 --> 13:00.875
Dude, I am so weightless.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.250
Rudy, if you were weightless,
I'd be weightless.

13:04.333 --> 13:05.750
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

13:06.458 --> 13:09.041
Rudy, we can finish this mission.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.625
We just have to be focused and stay calm.

13:11.709 --> 13:12.792
What are you saying?

13:12.875 --> 13:15.875
I'm saying we can get this big,
beautiful tin can back to earth,

13:15.959 --> 13:17.375
but I can't do it alone.

13:17.417 --> 13:20.542
Major Rudy Gillespie
reporting for duty, sir.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.625
Are you sure you can do this, Milton?

13:23.709 --> 13:27.083
I've wanted to be an astronaut
since I was four years old.

13:27.166 --> 13:30.375
I've studied every single one
of these buttons and switches.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.834
And I know what every
single one of them does.

13:33.625 --> 13:34.625
Except this one.

13:41.291 --> 13:43.208
Let's call that the spinny button.

13:46.583 --> 13:49.166
Okay, that red wire
is the main security camera feed

13:49.250 --> 13:50.375
that runs throughout the school.

13:50.458 --> 13:52.959
Connect that wire to the USB port
that controls those MyPads.

13:53.041 --> 13:56.000
They'll become monitors and then you'll be
able to see all over the school.

13:56.333 --> 13:57.959
You lost me at red wire.

13:58.667 --> 13:59.959
Just plug it in!

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
- Oh, sweet.
<i>Whoo!</i>

14:05.083 --> 14:07.000
Okay, now by using these poles and ropes,

14:07.083 --> 14:08.750
I can control everything in the building.

14:13.625 --> 14:14.667
Psst.

14:15.333 --> 14:16.333
Over here.

14:17.333 --> 14:19.959
<i>Hey, dummy, in the sink.</i>

14:29.542 --> 14:30.583
- Yeah!
- Yes!

14:30.667 --> 14:32.333
Dude, you did it. That was genius.

14:32.417 --> 14:33.959
Oh, I'm just getting warmed up.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.166
Time to reverse the air flow.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.125
Whoa!

14:46.208 --> 14:47.667
-
- Yeah!

14:47.750 --> 14:49.083
I got to remember that little trick

14:49.166 --> 14:51.583
the next time the librarian
parks in my spot.

14:54.375 --> 14:55.709
Jerry, he's getting up.

14:55.792 --> 14:58.917
Oh, not for long. Time for the waxer.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.792
Now I can control the waxer from here
with this remote.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.750
Yeah! Ooh!

15:33.583 --> 15:34.959
No!

15:36.625 --> 15:38.667
- Yes!
- Whoo! Nice.

15:38.750 --> 15:39.959
Okay, now...

15:40.041 --> 15:41.333
while Brock is still dazed,

15:41.417 --> 15:44.208
I'm gonna go over there, grab his keys,
unlock these chains--

15:44.291 --> 15:45.333
Jerry!

15:58.083 --> 16:00.000
Heaven, help us.

16:00.375 --> 16:02.625
You just woke the Hyena.

16:04.375 --> 16:06.250
<i>♪ And no matter how much
I chop and punch ♪</i>

16:06.375 --> 16:09.000
<i>♪ It's not as cool
As kickin' it with you ♪</i>

16:09.083 --> 16:11.000
Rock! Rock! Rock!

16:11.083 --> 16:12.000
They're asteroids.

16:12.083 --> 16:14.583
Asteroid! Asteroid! Asteroid!

16:27.375 --> 16:30.083
<i>Warning, left engine failure.</i>

16:30.166 --> 16:31.333
That's not good.

16:31.417 --> 16:33.792
<i>Right engine failure.</i>

16:33.875 --> 16:35.000
That's worse.

16:35.083 --> 16:37.166
<i>Total engine failure.</i>

16:37.250 --> 16:39.625
Yeah, yeah! We get it. It's over!

16:40.583 --> 16:43.750
The only shot we have is
if I use Farrington's third axiom

16:43.834 --> 16:45.667
to reverse our directional cosine matrix.

16:45.750 --> 16:48.166
Yeah, that sounds about right.

16:48.250 --> 16:49.583
Hang on tight.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.959
I just realized why they have
the spinny button.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.417
We made it.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.792
We did it. We're home.

17:10.875 --> 17:14.417
Okay, let's get out of here
before we get into trouble.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.417
You wouldn't have gotten into trouble.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.667
It would have been me.

17:17.959 --> 17:20.125
I flipped the switch causing
the whole thing.

17:20.208 --> 17:21.291
I'm the adult.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.250
I would have taken the responsibility.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.959
He did it. It was him. The boy did it.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.667
What is your name, son?

17:32.750 --> 17:34.542
Milton Krupnick, sir.

17:34.625 --> 17:38.583
Krupnick, I've never seen anyone
fly a simulator like that.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.250
Well, I've wanted to be an astronaut
since I was--

17:42.333 --> 17:44.458
Wait, did you just say "simulator"?

17:45.166 --> 17:48.083
Well, you didn't actually think
you were in space, did you?

17:48.792 --> 17:50.667
- Absolutely not.
- Very much so.

17:52.208 --> 17:56.917
Son, would you ever consider joining
our junior space program?

17:58.291 --> 18:00.792
Milton D. Krupnick,
reporting for duty, sir.

18:01.667 --> 18:02.917
Oh, boy.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.709
Yeah, uh, that turbulence
stirred up my Jupiter Jerky.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.250
- Permission to puke?
- Denied!

18:09.333 --> 18:11.125
Overruled!

18:16.792 --> 18:19.083
All right, we're safe in here.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.500
That door's double bolted.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.250
If you ask me,
I think it's time we stand up

18:22.333 --> 18:23.750
and show him we're not afraid.

18:25.041 --> 18:27.291
Ahh! Mama, save me!

18:27.875 --> 18:29.458
Here's what's gonna happen.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.542
I'm leaving this school with those MyPads.

18:31.625 --> 18:34.417
And there's nothing the four of you
can do about it.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.583
You're not going anywhere.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.625
Those MyPads belong to the school.

18:44.583 --> 18:45.959
-
- Ow!

18:46.041 --> 18:47.542
Jerry, the keys.

19:00.250 --> 19:02.250
Aah!

19:02.333 --> 19:05.208
Yes, sir! The Hyena's in the house.

19:06.917 --> 19:07.917
Sorry, old habit.

19:35.458 --> 19:36.792
Yo, Brock.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.709
Nobody messes with my school but me.

19:54.792 --> 19:57.041
Jerry, what you did was incredible.

19:57.125 --> 19:58.959
I mean you had the chance to run,
but you didn't.

19:59.041 --> 20:00.208
Yeah, dude, that was amazing.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.917
You saved the MyPads and took down
a crazed cage fighter.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.083
Well, I get you guys in enough trouble.

20:05.166 --> 20:06.959
I figured it was about time I get you out.

20:07.041 --> 20:09.000
Let's go get the cops.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.250
All right, let's go.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.041
Uh, guys...

20:14.375 --> 20:15.500
Still chained up here.

20:15.875 --> 20:16.917
Guys?

20:17.959 --> 20:21.750
Well, Brock, your plan failed.

20:21.834 --> 20:24.625
Oh, you might have been tough once, but...

20:24.709 --> 20:26.166
Oh, look at that.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.166
You're chained to the same pipe as me.

20:30.166 --> 20:31.417
Please don't hurt me.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.500
I was a member of your herd.

20:43.375 --> 20:47.083
It was really nice of you to take me out
for a bite to eat after my shift.

20:47.333 --> 20:50.041
I think it was even nicer of you to pay.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.542
So this is your dojo, huh?

20:53.625 --> 20:56.000
Yup, this is my kingdom.

20:56.417 --> 20:59.250
And if you'll excuse me,
I have to go sit on the throne.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.375
Something is not agreeing with me.

21:02.125 --> 21:03.250
Classy.

21:10.333 --> 21:11.709
This is Bemini-four

21:11.792 --> 21:13.250
reporting back to Klaxon.

21:13.333 --> 21:16.375
I have implanted egg in Earthling.

21:16.458 --> 21:20.208
Alien offspring will be born
in three, two...

21:20.834 --> 21:22.875
<i>Ew!</i>

21:22.959 --> 21:25.834
<i>Who and what are you?</i>

21:27.917 --> 21:30.041
<i>Wah! Dada.</i>

21:56.834 --> 21:57.709
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.917 --> 22:02.834
<i>Yes!</i>
