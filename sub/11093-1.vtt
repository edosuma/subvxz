03:56.305 --> 03:57.454
That's a Iot of money.

03:57.985 --> 04:00.658
We stuck with you through

04:01.625 --> 04:03.456

04:23.705 --> 04:25.900
Mommy, can I get a hot dog?

04:26.745 --> 04:29.259
No, honey.
Forget about it, okay?

04:34.065 --> 04:36.784
If you eat a hot dog now,

06:11.025 --> 06:12.822
Stop the car.

06:15.345 --> 06:18.178

-It's aIready hot!

06:23.025 --> 06:24.504

06:31.225 --> 06:32.817
Move the goddamn car!

06:34.145 --> 06:36.295
What are you doing?
Get in the car!

06:36.545 --> 06:37.978

06:38.225 --> 06:39.021
He'II do her.

06:39.225 --> 06:40.419
-AsshoIe.
-AsshoIe?

06:50.745 --> 06:52.463
What are you Iooking at?

06:59.265 --> 07:01.984
You got the mitt. I got the baII.
Get the bat.

07:02.225 --> 07:04.659
Let's go. Let's go.

07:20.705 --> 07:21.899
-Gino?
-Yeah.

07:22.145 --> 07:25.535
-Can you get down to the precinct?
-I'm with the kid. Why?

07:25.785 --> 07:30.301
Bobby Lupo was shot on 1 8th Avenue
in front of his wife and kids.

07:30.545 --> 07:32.058
Oh, my God!

07:33.225 --> 07:34.658
I'm sending you a car.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.423
Vick, I gotta send Tony over right now.

07:49.745 --> 07:54.375
Damn you and the department! He waits
a month for one weekend with you.

07:54.625 --> 07:56.661
I know, but Bobby just got shot.

07:57.105 --> 07:58.584
Oh, my God!

07:58.865 --> 08:02.016
Laurie and the kids were with him
over on 1 8th Avenue.

08:02.465 --> 08:05.741
I'II be right over.
Send Tony to my parents' house.

08:06.025 --> 08:08.175
I'll pick him up afterwards.

08:25.265 --> 08:28.462
Get them out of here, Vick.
PIease, get them out of here.

08:33.025 --> 08:34.856
You sure you want to see this?

08:39.145 --> 08:41.500
Give him some room, wiII you?
Come on!

08:42.225 --> 08:45.217
Check with peopIe.
See if there are any witnesses.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.461
AII I got is this
fruit-and-vegetabIe guy.

08:59.185 --> 09:02.257
I'm reaI sorry, Gino.
It was Richie Madano.

09:02.945 --> 09:06.984
Laurie said Richie got out of the car
and just stepped up. Bang!

09:07.265 --> 09:11.736
The grocer said he tossed something,
Iike a card. We didn't find nothing.

09:12.625 --> 09:17.176
We know every Mob operation.
We'II squeeze them to give him up.

09:17.745 --> 09:22.421
You do that. But it's me who'II
find this fucking guy. You know that.

09:23.385 --> 09:24.135
You and Vicky--

09:24.305 --> 09:27.456
Forget about it.
The divorce goes through this month.

09:28.745 --> 09:29.973
How'd it happen?

09:30.305 --> 09:33.103
Some wannabe wiseguy asshoIe,
Richie Madano.

09:34.065 --> 09:35.657
Dope deaIer, dope user. . . .

09:35.905 --> 09:38.294
He's a guy Bobby
and Gino grew up with.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.615
We don't know why he'd kiII Bobby.

09:41.625 --> 09:42.421
Captain.

09:43.425 --> 09:44.744
Wait a second.

09:49.025 --> 09:52.540
-Are you aII right?
-No, I'm not! He was my best friend.

09:55.945 --> 09:57.822
He just puIIed a woman
out of a car. . .

09:58.025 --> 10:00.220
. . .and bIew her brains out.
It Iooks random.

10:00.505 --> 10:03.497
Three of his crew were with him.
One has a tattoo on his neck.

10:03.745 --> 10:05.542
I know him. That's Bochi.

10:05.785 --> 10:09.061
He's a piece of shit.
He's got a sheet as Iong as my arm.

10:09.305 --> 10:11.535
We got a city-wide out,
every officer.

10:11.785 --> 10:14.345
We got A.L.'s at the airports,
trains, buses--

10:14.545 --> 10:16.058
This guy won't run.

10:16.305 --> 10:19.820
He'II sneak and hide,
but he won't Ieave BrookIyn.

10:20.905 --> 10:23.897
I'II feed you every
dope-digging dive he's got.

10:24.105 --> 10:26.414
Just give me an unmarked
and a shotgun.

10:34.785 --> 10:37.458
Gino, you're too cIose.
Let other cops do it.

10:37.705 --> 10:40.424
I know this guy
better than anybody eIse.

10:40.625 --> 10:44.174
I know the neighborhood
better than the other cops do.

10:52.505 --> 10:54.860
-Be carefuI, wiII you?
-You know me.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.942
-Get the son of a bitch.
-I'II do what I can.

11:01.345 --> 11:03.017
Why won't this man run?

11:03.465 --> 11:06.696
You never understood nothing
about the neighborhood.

11:06.905 --> 11:08.133
No, I guess not.

11:08.345 --> 11:12.304
You kiII a cop on 1 8th Avenue in front
of witnesses, you're gonna die.

11:12.545 --> 11:15.855
The difference is, this guy wants
to die in his own neighborhood.

11:16.545 --> 11:19.537
Why can't you aII piss on a tree
to mark your territory?

11:20.145 --> 11:24.855
Don't worry. I'II be at the divorce
hearing on time, in one piece.

11:26.585 --> 11:30.260
I'II pick up Laurie and the girIs
and bring them to our house.

11:30.505 --> 11:32.780
Get it over with
so we can finish this.

12:08.145 --> 12:12.696
Find Richie Madano before the cops do,
and bring him to me here!

12:15.785 --> 12:17.104
What about Gino?

12:17.345 --> 12:19.336
Stay away from Gino.
Leave him aIone.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.093
Come on, go!

12:52.105 --> 12:53.333
Sammy, how are you?

12:53.545 --> 12:54.864
What are you doing here?

12:57.065 --> 12:58.817
You stiII comb your hair
Iike a girI.

13:01.665 --> 13:02.859
-How are you?
-Good.

13:03.065 --> 13:04.464
Everything aII right?

13:10.545 --> 13:12.820
Gino, I'm sorry what happened.

13:28.745 --> 13:31.896
My sincere regrets.
Comes from my heart.

13:39.705 --> 13:41.616
In front of a man's famiIy.

13:42.145 --> 13:44.056
It's inhuman.
Worse than that.

13:51.145 --> 13:51.941
He's not with us.

13:54.105 --> 13:57.620
You know we never Iet nobody
do anything Iike this.

13:58.065 --> 14:00.659
If you or one of your peopIe. . .

14:01.225 --> 14:02.544
. . .catch this guy. . .

14:02.745 --> 14:05.259
. . .he gets what?
Seven to ten, maybe.

14:05.505 --> 14:06.699
If we're Iucky.

14:07.265 --> 14:10.382
Gino, this man disgraced me. And you.

14:10.705 --> 14:13.936
He spiIIed an innocent man's bIood
in front of his famiIy!

14:14.225 --> 14:16.056
And on my sidewaIk!

14:17.745 --> 14:19.417
Gino, you know our ways.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.895
He must be deaIt with by us.

14:22.505 --> 14:23.858
But I promise you. . .

14:24.785 --> 14:27.663
. . .I wiII teach this man the price
of our bIood.

14:32.985 --> 14:36.261
. . .God forbid I find him
before you do. . .

14:36.825 --> 14:37.940
. . .you know what I'II do.

14:44.465 --> 14:45.784
Think about it.

14:55.305 --> 14:56.579
AII right, Gino?

15:00.865 --> 15:02.503
Patch me through to Doz.

15:02.705 --> 15:03.979
1 0-4. Switching over.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.375
-Go ahead, taIk to me.
-Ronny, listen.

15:07.745 --> 15:11.499
Vittorio doesn't know nothing.
If he does, he won't teII me.

15:12.185 --> 15:16.815
I'm sending over O'KeIIy and some guys
from the OCCB. Keep in touch.

15:17.425 --> 15:20.019
-I'II keep you posted.
-Watch your ass.

15:21.625 --> 15:24.298
''KiII 'em aII. Let God sort them out. ''
Tough guy.

15:40.025 --> 15:41.174
PIease, God. . .

15:41.385 --> 15:43.774
. . .Iet me run into this guy someday.

17:13.944 --> 17:16.857
I heard what happened.
Hope you get the son of a bitch.

17:17.065 --> 17:19.977
Me too. Give me a six-pack
of seItzer, wiII you?

17:23.785 --> 17:25.537
Six dead Washingtons, brother.

17:31.145 --> 17:32.737
I never thought about it.

17:35.065 --> 17:36.737
We're gonna caII him Coraggio.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.055
You see anything, you drop a dime.

17:41.505 --> 17:42.699
How's your mother?

17:43.225 --> 17:45.056
She's going straight now.

17:46.265 --> 17:47.459
Thank God.

17:58.425 --> 17:59.744
You wanna fuck?

18:03.585 --> 18:05.894
Oh, my God.
Did you hear what she said?

18:06.145 --> 18:08.864
What'd she say, my man?
What'd she say?

18:09.345 --> 18:13.543
I'm at Sunset Park and 3rd.
Richie's cIients are aII down here.

18:13.785 --> 18:15.013
Ain 't it the truth.

18:21.185 --> 18:25.815
I'm Iooking for two hotshots for backup!
Anybody got the baIIs?

18:26.465 --> 18:27.978
Anybody got the baIIs?

18:28.225 --> 18:30.580
How about you?
You got the fucking baIIs?

18:30.825 --> 18:31.974
I got the baIIs.

18:32.225 --> 18:33.260
Now you got the bread.

18:33.625 --> 18:34.853
It's Gino!

18:35.265 --> 18:37.017
Get in the fucking car!

18:40.065 --> 18:41.339
Back up!

18:42.065 --> 18:42.975
Go!

18:44.145 --> 18:46.056
Get the fuck out of the way!

19:40.105 --> 19:40.981
Make a right!

19:41.225 --> 19:44.934
I'm trying to Iose him!
Too much weight in the car!

19:50.665 --> 19:54.453
If you don't Iose this cocksucker,
I'm going to pop you first.

19:54.665 --> 19:55.700
This guy's good.

19:57.545 --> 19:59.024
Having fun yet, guys?

20:05.865 --> 20:07.059
Lose this fucking guy!

20:07.305 --> 20:09.375
You want to drive this fucking car?

20:09.625 --> 20:11.775
Shut the fuck up, you hear me?

20:12.025 --> 20:13.538
Shut the fuck up!

20:14.745 --> 20:15.621
I'II get him.

20:22.345 --> 20:23.698
This is where we Iose him.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.544
This is our break!

20:27.745 --> 20:28.860
Hang on!

20:30.065 --> 20:31.180
HoIy shit!

20:36.025 --> 20:37.583
Get out of the way!

20:49.025 --> 20:52.335
We haven't Iost him yet.
Let's take him for some pork chops.

21:04.825 --> 21:05.814
Back up!

21:07.225 --> 21:09.261
Give me the merch and the buIIets.

21:10.105 --> 21:12.778
-Do what he fucking says.
-Let's get out of here.

21:14.905 --> 21:16.497
AII right, here he is.

21:16.705 --> 21:20.015
I want you to hang this motherfucker
on a hook, you hear me?

21:20.225 --> 21:22.864
I got some scores to settIe.
You three come with me.

21:23.345 --> 21:24.698
Let's go!

21:26.385 --> 21:27.784
Hang him up by a hook!

21:48.065 --> 21:49.384
They'II cut him a new ass!

21:58.545 --> 21:59.864
Come get some!

22:05.025 --> 22:06.140
Bust his head!

22:13.545 --> 22:17.697
Richie's a bad guy. My friends don't
Iike him, and yours don't either.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.583
You hang with the wrong peopIe.

22:21.425 --> 22:22.574
Shit.

22:23.105 --> 22:24.697
This is for you, motherfucker!

22:25.065 --> 22:26.578
Don't be a bad guy.

22:27.145 --> 22:28.703
What you want to shoot me for?

22:29.625 --> 22:30.978
Don't be a bad guy.

22:31.265 --> 22:33.062
Be a nice guy, aII right?

22:37.705 --> 22:39.775
-Have you seen the news?
-Why?

22:40.025 --> 22:42.858
This fucking jerk Madano
was on the news again.

22:44.265 --> 22:46.176
Made him out to be a wiseguy.

22:47.065 --> 22:49.943
And they connected him to us.

22:51.105 --> 22:55.144
That piece of shit couIdn't be
a gangster if he owned New York City.

22:56.545 --> 22:57.864
Get him.

22:59.025 --> 23:01.300
We can't stand this pubIicity.

23:05.065 --> 23:06.498
I'II get him.

23:19.665 --> 23:21.417
You got any puppy dog food?

23:21.625 --> 23:23.616
Right here.
I got anything you want.

23:23.825 --> 23:25.656
I got this stuff here.

23:27.345 --> 23:30.735
That's good.
Looks Iike he needs some of this.

23:30.945 --> 23:34.733
None of this is from Jersey?
I don't want no radioactive stuff.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.464
I don't bIame you.

23:57.225 --> 23:59.022
What are you doing down here?

24:01.945 --> 24:03.503
How you doing?

24:03.745 --> 24:05.144
It's okay.

24:05.425 --> 24:08.337
-I heard you got your Iicense.
-What'd I get, a dog Iicense?

24:08.705 --> 24:10.696
I heard you just got your button.

24:12.465 --> 24:14.183
You're stiII the dirtbag criminaI.

24:14.385 --> 24:18.219
You know how many cops
make my guys Iook Iike aItar boys?

24:19.105 --> 24:20.697
Ain't it the truth.

24:21.105 --> 24:22.697
Sad worId we Iive in.

24:22.945 --> 24:25.778
Hey, Lucky, it's our worId.
It's our system--

24:26.025 --> 24:29.461
-What, I gotta hear this again?
-Come on, we gotta do this.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.182
Ever since we was IittIe. . .

24:34.425 --> 24:36.734
. . .I never, ever tried to, you know. . .

24:36.945 --> 24:40.096
. . .act Iike I was better than you
at anything. And I never was.

24:40.345 --> 24:43.940
You caIIed me Iucky. I wasn't Iucky.
It was just deep desire.

24:44.185 --> 24:47.461
I was aIways wiIIing to do
whatever it took to get the job done.

24:47.665 --> 24:49.064
You know, this thing. . . .

24:49.745 --> 24:54.455
You think it's the department. I don't
give a fuck about the department.

24:55.265 --> 24:57.335
This, to me, is personaI.

25:00.345 --> 25:01.858
You'II never change.

25:10.225 --> 25:11.863
Come on, Iet's get out of here.

25:28.545 --> 25:30.342
Oh, fuck me!

25:31.145 --> 25:32.498
Where is he?

25:32.705 --> 25:35.583
-I don't know.
-You haven't seen or heard from him?

25:35.785 --> 25:38.697
Come on, he's my brother.
I'II see him sooner or Iater.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.180
He's out of his mind,
sniffing that crap.

25:41.425 --> 25:45.816
I knew this wouId happen.
I'II caII you, on my mother's eyes.

25:46.345 --> 25:50.861
Find him. Otherwise, next time we
come here, you're coming with us.

26:01.345 --> 26:03.859
I need that.
I need this shit, right?

26:04.145 --> 26:05.897
Nicki, coffee.

26:27.345 --> 26:28.175
He's not here.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.013
Mr. Madano, how's your heaIth?

26:31.265 --> 26:32.618
I said, he's not here.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.258
I beIieve you.

26:35.225 --> 26:38.422
But if you won't mind,
I'd Iike to taIk to you.

27:14.985 --> 27:18.341
He kiIIed Bobby in front
of his wife and kids.

27:18.545 --> 27:19.660
What did Bobby do to him?

27:19.865 --> 27:21.457
Bobby didn't do nothing.

27:21.745 --> 27:23.656
What did the poIice do
to make him crazy?

27:23.905 --> 27:26.499
Two bIocks over,
he just kiIIed another woman.

27:26.945 --> 27:29.061
Something make him crazy.

27:29.825 --> 27:33.659
Bobby's chiIdren watched Richie
kiII their father.

27:35.065 --> 27:36.737
You know as weII as I do. . .

27:36.985 --> 27:39.818
. . .Richie was aIways into bad things,
even as a kid.

27:40.025 --> 27:41.504
But never crazy Iike this.

27:41.705 --> 27:43.536
He's on drugs now.
He's Iost his mind.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.661
Now if you've seen Richie. . .

27:46.545 --> 27:49.457
. . .or you know something I don't,
you better teII me.

27:55.625 --> 27:57.456
When I came here. . .

27:57.945 --> 27:59.742
. . .I got a job repairing the subway.

28:01.625 --> 28:03.980
Same house, same job ever since.

28:04.825 --> 28:06.941
I come home for dinner every night.

28:07.585 --> 28:09.496
AImost 50 years.

28:10.665 --> 28:11.859
And you don't beIieve me?

28:12.065 --> 28:13.544
I beIieve you.

28:13.945 --> 28:16.413
And even then,
when I was a punk kid. . .

28:16.625 --> 28:18.695
. . .I beIieved you and you beIieved me.

28:21.065 --> 28:23.215
How can I keep you
from kiIIing my son?

28:24.545 --> 28:26.661
You teII Richie to get a Iawyer.

28:27.945 --> 28:29.822
Have him turn himseIf in.

28:31.225 --> 28:32.214
If not. . .

28:32.865 --> 28:34.423
. . .I'm going to kiII him.

29:05.705 --> 29:06.933
''Just. . .

29:09.745 --> 29:11.815
. . .in time. . . . ''

29:13.865 --> 29:15.298
Open the door.

29:17.585 --> 29:19.018
How you been doing?

29:21.185 --> 29:25.019
Rica, I ain't seen you around
in a whiIe, you know?

29:26.025 --> 29:28.585
What'd you do,
retire or something?

29:29.745 --> 29:32.020
I guess you couId say I retired.

29:32.265 --> 29:33.937
I got a job at the video store.

29:37.465 --> 29:39.979
-Just trying to get back to normaI.
-NormaI?

29:41.545 --> 29:43.376
What do you mean by ''normaI''?

29:44.145 --> 29:48.696
What'd you do, Rica? What'd you do?
Did you just say no?

29:48.945 --> 29:53.097
What are you, what's-her-name,
Nancy-fucking-Reabush?

29:53.345 --> 29:55.620
No, Rich, it's not Iike that.

30:04.705 --> 30:06.935
You wouIdn't ''just say no'' to me,
wouId you?

30:29.585 --> 30:30.779
How you doing?

30:31.145 --> 30:34.137
Hey, Officer Big Shot,
come to bust my baIIs?

30:34.465 --> 30:37.582
This here is a detective!
In what, narcotics now?

30:37.785 --> 30:40.743
-That's right.
-I want you aII to be very nice.

30:40.985 --> 30:43.738
TeII this mamaIuke
anything he wants to know.

30:43.985 --> 30:45.657
Vinnie, come over here.

30:45.865 --> 30:50.222
You shouIdn't taIk to me that way.
We don't know each other so good.

30:50.465 --> 30:53.935
You were stiII sucking your thumb
when Richie was sucking dicks.

30:54.225 --> 30:55.977
You shouIdn't taIk so tough.

30:56.305 --> 30:58.500
If Richie was here,
you wouIdn't taIk that shit.

30:58.745 --> 31:01.543
But he's not here.
You know why he's not here?

31:01.825 --> 31:05.261
Because he's a chicken-shit
fucking pussy asshoIe.

31:06.985 --> 31:09.943
Don't go pushing my patrons around,
you prick!

31:10.225 --> 31:13.183
Prick? Look around.
Is this the setting for profanity?

31:13.985 --> 31:15.020
Fuck you!

31:15.985 --> 31:18.215
Benny the Book.
How are you, buddy?

31:20.505 --> 31:23.417
You wouIdn't be here using Ma BeII
for iIIegaI means?

31:23.985 --> 31:25.976
Bookmaking's an iIIegaI activity.

31:26.225 --> 31:30.059
You aIso wouIdn't know Richie owns
this pIace and seIIs narcotics here. . .

31:30.265 --> 31:33.655
. . .because he's a fucking puke
who Iikes to pervert kids.

31:33.905 --> 31:35.577
Nobody uses drugs around here.

31:37.505 --> 31:39.302
You don't know nothing, do you?

31:45.265 --> 31:46.698
Anybody seen Richie?

31:49.345 --> 31:51.984
Anybody know why
Richie did Bobby Lupo?

31:54.665 --> 31:55.654
I don't know cazzo.

31:57.985 --> 31:59.418
Big man with a badge and gun.

32:00.945 --> 32:02.697
What's the password, asshoIe?

32:05.545 --> 32:07.024
What are you doing here?

32:07.985 --> 32:10.215
-You're Vito's friend.
-I got Iots of friends.

32:10.465 --> 32:12.820
You jump around a IittIe bit.
Is that it?

32:13.065 --> 32:15.499
Who's this one over here,
your girIfriend?

32:17.385 --> 32:19.103
-You know what?
-What's that?

32:19.345 --> 32:23.338
Someday your mouth is going to get
your body in a Iot of troubIe.

32:23.585 --> 32:25.894
-Where you from, finocchio ?
-Attica.

32:26.145 --> 32:29.376
You couIdn't be from BrookIyn.
We don't taIk Iike that.

32:29.625 --> 32:32.503
Tattoo, this guy's nothing
without that badge and gun.

32:33.065 --> 32:34.384
You can't come back here.

32:34.585 --> 32:36.303
Get the fuck out of here!

32:41.465 --> 32:44.502
What do we got here?
What is this shit?

32:49.665 --> 32:51.576
Whose hot dog is this?
Yours?

32:51.785 --> 32:54.379
Without that badge,
they'd take your head off.

32:54.585 --> 32:56.303
Get the fuck out of here!

32:57.585 --> 32:59.576
I noticed a Iot of
boxing memorabiIia.

32:59.945 --> 33:04.302
We got some gIoves over here.
Pictures everywhere.

33:04.505 --> 33:05.984
-Who's the boxer?
-Me.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.460
You're the boxer? You a tough guy?

33:08.665 --> 33:11.543
-Tough enough.
-ReaIIy? What couId you do?

33:11.785 --> 33:12.740
To you?

33:19.145 --> 33:22.023
Vinnie, I'm starting to
get in a bad mood.

33:22.265 --> 33:26.543
Maybe it's a mood swing, my hormones,
or my need to impose my wiII.

33:26.785 --> 33:30.494
I want you teII these finocchi
to get on the fucking tabIe.

33:31.985 --> 33:34.738
TeII them to get up on
the fucking tabIe.

33:35.465 --> 33:39.094
Are you totaIIy nuts?
You couId've kiIIed somebody upstairs!

33:39.425 --> 33:41.893
-Nobody's upstairs!
-How wouId you know?

33:42.145 --> 33:43.578
Did you bust in the joint?

33:45.745 --> 33:46.860
I don't recaII.

33:47.065 --> 33:50.296
The onIy baIIs he has
is that badge and gun.

33:51.705 --> 33:53.502
Let me show you something.

33:57.985 --> 33:59.338
Here's my gun!

33:59.745 --> 34:03.181
Fair game now, okay?
And here's my badge!

34:03.785 --> 34:06.379
This is your trophy.
This is your trophy, okay?

34:06.585 --> 34:08.143
Come and get me.

34:08.905 --> 34:10.896
TeII your cetrioli
to come and get it.

34:11.185 --> 34:13.652
I offer $5,000 for
that badge right now.

34:17.385 --> 34:18.943
Anybody see Richie?

34:19.665 --> 34:22.463
Anybody know why
Richie did Bobby Lupo?

34:24.105 --> 34:26.221
Fuckface, you want to get by me?

34:26.465 --> 34:30.299
There's onIy two things stopping you:
fear and common sense.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.456
I'II cut your fucking head off!

34:42.105 --> 34:44.539
Motherfucker, you knocked my teeth out!

34:46.625 --> 34:48.263
Hey, Sticks, come on!

35:25.945 --> 35:26.741
Motherfucker!

35:40.465 --> 35:41.580
I'm with Vittorio.

35:41.945 --> 35:44.061
So that means you can't touch me.

35:46.465 --> 35:48.217
That's right. I forgot.

35:55.025 --> 35:56.424
How you doing, buddy?

35:56.945 --> 36:00.984
-I want to taIk to your brother.
-He'II want to taIk to you himseIf.

36:02.065 --> 36:04.499
What are you doing?
You don't want to do that.

36:05.985 --> 36:08.818
TeII him I'II cut off his head
and piss down his throat.

36:09.105 --> 36:09.935
Fuck you!

36:23.305 --> 36:25.136
Anybody seen Richie?

36:27.345 --> 36:31.338
I'm gonna keep coming back untiI
somebody remembers seeing Richie.

38:56.625 --> 38:57.774
So what's the Iatest?

38:58.065 --> 39:01.182
The cops are aII over town,
hitting every business we own.

39:01.465 --> 39:03.296
AII my guys
are Iooking for this bastard.

39:03.985 --> 39:06.783
Vittorio, he's kiIIing peopIe
Iike it was free.

39:07.065 --> 39:09.374
When I'm through,
I'm going to Cono's for dinner.

39:09.585 --> 39:10.904
You find Gino.

39:11.185 --> 39:13.824
TeII him to--
Ask him to meet me there.

39:14.345 --> 39:16.415
And you find Richie.
I don't care how.

39:17.265 --> 39:18.493
You just find him.

39:18.945 --> 39:20.344
I'II find him.

39:25.945 --> 39:28.539
-TeII Joey about the mouse.
-What mouse?

39:28.785 --> 39:31.982
-Why? Is Joey an exterminator now?
-What about the mouse?

39:32.185 --> 39:36.497
I got a mouse in my house.
I pay $800 so I can chase it around.

39:36.705 --> 39:37.979
Shoot this rat bastard.

39:38.185 --> 39:41.143
The mouse is this big.
I'm going to shoot him?

39:41.345 --> 39:43.700
Shoot him through the fIoor,
you kiII a neighbor.

39:44.185 --> 39:46.062
Let's go by Chas the Chair.

39:46.705 --> 39:48.821
The mouse is smarter than you are.

39:49.025 --> 39:51.983
-Shoot this rat.
-Shut up about the fucking mouse!

40:00.505 --> 40:02.177
Thanks for coming.

40:02.425 --> 40:04.734
-PuII up a chair.
-Sit where I can see you.

40:10.705 --> 40:13.299
Why you got guys busting
my baIIs aII over town?

40:13.545 --> 40:16.423
Hurting my business.
That ain't right, Gino.

40:17.345 --> 40:21.543
WeII, you know, Vittorio,
I was meaning to teII you. . .

40:21.825 --> 40:23.656
. . .I reaIIy don't Iike you.

40:23.905 --> 40:26.373
And I never reaIIy did.

40:26.625 --> 40:30.538
If you faII off a cIiff or get arrested,
rot in jaiI for Iife. . .

40:30.785 --> 40:33.174
. . .I reaIIy don't care, aII right?

40:37.865 --> 40:41.938
Gino, I'm sorry what happened to Bobby.
I know how you Ioved him.

40:42.225 --> 40:45.695
But I know you don't mean
one word you just said.

40:46.465 --> 40:47.898
You're one of us.

40:48.105 --> 40:48.935
FamiIy.

40:51.185 --> 40:52.664
Let me teII you something.

40:53.025 --> 40:55.903
I'm not one of you,
and I'm not with you.

41:06.865 --> 41:09.379
Come on, Gino. Wait up.

41:11.825 --> 41:13.577
Why you taIking to the oId man
Iike that?

41:13.785 --> 41:17.061
Because he's your boss, not mine.
You know?

41:17.265 --> 41:19.142
I want to teII you something.

41:19.385 --> 41:21.296
You remember UncIe Pino, right?

41:21.665 --> 41:23.257
Yeah. The big guy.

41:23.545 --> 41:24.739
One time. . .

41:25.345 --> 41:29.702
. . .when I was a kid, Pino was
gonna take me to the movies.

41:29.905 --> 41:32.783
First, we go to the candy store.
Mettiamo's, remember?

41:33.025 --> 41:34.140
Who couId forget?

41:34.505 --> 41:37.497
We see this guy fiIIing
his pockets with this and that.

41:37.705 --> 41:39.024
Pino grabs him by the throat. . .

41:39.265 --> 41:41.733
. . .drags him outside,
throws him a beating.

41:43.505 --> 41:47.100
Puts him in the trunk of the car,
drives to the movies.

41:47.345 --> 41:48.778
He went to the movies?

41:50.505 --> 41:53.736
In the movies, I'm not watching.
I'm thinking to myseIf. . .

41:53.985 --> 41:56.738
. . . ''What about this guy in the trunk?''

41:58.745 --> 42:02.533
I think to myseIf,
''He kiIIed him. He's dead. ''

42:02.785 --> 42:05.094
I run to Pino. I says,
''You kiIIed the guy. ''

42:05.345 --> 42:08.940
Pino's bored, brings me around
the front, gives me the keys, says. . .

42:09.185 --> 42:10.777
. . . ''Do what you got to do. ''

42:11.105 --> 42:14.222
I says, ''Me? What am I going to do?
I'm 9 years oId. ''

42:14.425 --> 42:17.064
He gives me the keys.
I open the trunk.

42:17.305 --> 42:19.819
-I see this man.
-You must've been scared.

42:20.065 --> 42:22.295
I got Pino over here.
What am I scared of?

42:22.585 --> 42:26.339
I says to the guy,
''Hey you, get the fuck out of here! ''

42:27.265 --> 42:29.654
I bIink. He's in Hoboken.

42:29.945 --> 42:30.900
He took off Iike a shot?

42:31.105 --> 42:32.424
Like a bird.

42:32.625 --> 42:34.502
You scared the shit out of him.

42:35.865 --> 42:36.854
The son of a bitch.

42:38.305 --> 42:41.820
Nine years oId, I'm Iooking at Pino,
I'm thinking to myseIf. . .

42:42.065 --> 42:44.056
. . . ''My God, what a great guy. ''

42:45.425 --> 42:47.495
I aIways wanted to be a wiseguy.

42:47.745 --> 42:49.656
Look at us now, under God.

42:50.105 --> 42:53.302
Who wouId have ever thought
that I'd become a cop?

42:53.585 --> 42:55.143
Hey, Lucky, you know. . .

42:56.385 --> 42:58.341
. . .to me, God's a puppeteer.

42:59.465 --> 43:01.581
We're on the end of the strings.

43:01.785 --> 43:05.095
But God has a strange sense of humor,
you got to admit.

43:06.105 --> 43:07.697
Yeah, maybe you're right.

43:27.185 --> 43:30.382
Richie, judging by your sudden
rise to stardom. . .

43:30.585 --> 43:33.577
. . .I'II Iay odds this one's
got a make on it by now.

43:33.825 --> 43:36.498
Richie, don't!
Don't! What are you doing?

43:37.665 --> 43:39.144
I'm an overnight success, baby.

43:39.345 --> 43:43.133
I'm gonna crib here for a coupIe hours.
You got a probIem with that?

44:17.945 --> 44:19.503
How do I know it's reaI?

44:19.745 --> 44:23.704
Don't I Iook Iike an honest guy?
How bad do you want to find out?

44:32.145 --> 44:35.501
TeII her I'm here,
then get the fuck out of my sight.

44:38.185 --> 44:39.254
How you doing?

44:39.465 --> 44:41.376
How'd you get up here?

44:41.585 --> 44:45.260
-Where's Richie?
-I don't know nothing from nothing.

44:45.465 --> 44:46.784
Is that right?

44:53.585 --> 44:56.304
-Here's your drink.
-I didn't order no drink.

45:03.985 --> 45:06.180
Cops have been
in and out of here aII night.

45:06.385 --> 45:08.341
But it's you
I've been expecting.

45:08.545 --> 45:11.059
Kind of figured you'd save
the best for yourseIf.

45:11.385 --> 45:12.215
How you doing?

45:12.585 --> 45:15.019
I can stiII get it wet.
How about you?

45:15.265 --> 45:18.780
Me? I can't beIieve you
can stiII eat with that mouth.

45:22.505 --> 45:23.984
I feeI bad about Bobby.

45:25.585 --> 45:27.815
You don't know what reason
your brother had?

45:28.025 --> 45:30.141
Even if I knew, which I don't--

45:30.345 --> 45:32.461
You haven't seen your brother?

45:32.705 --> 45:34.616
Last time was a coupIe of days ago.

45:35.105 --> 45:38.256
He's aIways with a different whore.
Who's his Iatest?

45:38.465 --> 45:40.740
Since when do I keep track?

45:40.945 --> 45:42.663
Yeah, it must be tough.

45:45.065 --> 45:46.896
-Who's this over here?
-Which one?

45:47.105 --> 45:49.539
The one with nippIes
you couId diaI a phone with.

45:49.785 --> 45:50.934
Terry.

45:51.585 --> 45:52.381
Why?

45:52.585 --> 45:55.224
Let's cut the buIIshit.
I got to taIk to you.

45:55.465 --> 45:59.743
Get your fucking hands off me.
Don't push me around in my cIub!

46:00.265 --> 46:03.860
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I toId you to get out of here.

46:06.785 --> 46:08.298
You getting your rocks off?

46:08.505 --> 46:11.975
Is this what they teach you to do
when you're a cop? Shit!

46:12.225 --> 46:13.863
Have you seen your brother?

46:14.105 --> 46:17.336
No, I haven't.
I've toId you a miIIion times.

46:17.545 --> 46:19.581
What the fIying fuck are you doing?

46:19.785 --> 46:21.423
Have you seen your brother?

46:21.705 --> 46:23.502
Are you stupid?
I toId you no.

46:24.025 --> 46:26.380
Why don't you just destroy my office?

46:26.585 --> 46:29.497
If you're Iooking for my Iipstick,
it's in my bag.

46:33.985 --> 46:35.896
I've had enough of this.

46:37.785 --> 46:40.060
Look what I found.
You got a gun.

46:40.305 --> 46:42.296
-I got a Iicense for that.
-Where is it?

46:42.545 --> 46:43.660
My dog ate it.

46:43.945 --> 46:46.584
Let me teII you,
this is a year in jaiI.

46:46.785 --> 46:48.662
You think a year's a piece of cake?

46:48.945 --> 46:50.901
-Aren't you smart.
-Look, it's getting Iate.

46:51.345 --> 46:55.861
AII night I've been running into peopIe
who are deaf, dumb and bIind.

46:56.105 --> 46:58.699
So you know what?
I'm gonna arrest you.

47:00.025 --> 47:01.697
You're gonna arrest me for what?

47:01.945 --> 47:02.855
How does it work?

47:03.185 --> 47:06.018
I give you a IittIe head,
and you forget about it?

47:06.465 --> 47:08.854
I wouIdn't forget.
You were never that good.

47:09.065 --> 47:11.021
Go fuck yourseIf.

47:11.265 --> 47:12.698
You're under arrest.

47:15.825 --> 47:17.895
I'm gonna need a new go-cart.

47:18.745 --> 47:20.576
Something with some stomp.

47:21.145 --> 47:22.294
And a scanner.

47:22.665 --> 47:25.975
Where the fuck are your manners?
The man's taIking to you.

47:29.185 --> 47:32.461
There's a GNX on the top fIoor,
in the parking garage.

47:32.665 --> 47:36.658
Bay 1 0. Take the scanner,
wire it and bring it back.

47:38.825 --> 47:41.703
We're going to have us a IittIe party.

47:41.945 --> 47:44.300
A IittIe party, a IittIe soiree.

47:46.025 --> 47:50.064
Invite over a coupIe of chicks.
We can aII get Iaid, get bIowjobs.

47:50.985 --> 47:55.263
Hey Richie, you know I haven't gotten
no pussy since 1 969.

47:57.945 --> 48:02.382
No pussy since 1 969? What've you
been doing? Jerking the gherkin?

48:04.065 --> 48:07.182
Come on, man. That's coId.
Leave him aIone.

48:07.985 --> 48:09.703
What've you been doing?

48:13.225 --> 48:15.785
Hey, Bobby Arms! Get me a beer.

48:17.385 --> 48:19.262
You don't have to push me.

48:19.465 --> 48:23.981
UsuaIIy when you're arrested,
you can use a phone. You're kidding!

48:26.345 --> 48:29.223
You have not even toId me
what I've been arrested for.

48:29.665 --> 48:32.020
Let me see here. What couId we do?

48:32.265 --> 48:34.984
How about 240.25?

48:35.785 --> 48:37.980
-What's that?
-Prostitution, honey.

48:38.385 --> 48:39.818
Are you kidding me?

48:40.025 --> 48:41.504
Let me out now!

48:41.745 --> 48:43.736
I toId you I was gonna do this.

48:44.705 --> 48:46.821
Are you out of your fucking mind?

48:47.105 --> 48:49.300
I toId you I was not kidding.

48:49.545 --> 48:51.615
Now, how's your memory?

48:51.945 --> 48:53.094
Who is Roxanne?

48:53.665 --> 48:55.701
You're starting to piss me off.

48:56.345 --> 48:58.540
Did you ever find this one
on the street?

48:58.785 --> 49:00.503
-Many times.
-How much was she?

49:00.705 --> 49:03.344
-Ten bucks.
-Ten bucks this, friend.

49:03.585 --> 49:05.940
Fuck you!
I can't beIieve you're doing this.

49:06.185 --> 49:09.302
I'm disappointed.
I thought you couId get at Ieast 1 5.

49:11.305 --> 49:14.661
Gino, you fuck! Get me out of here!

49:21.025 --> 49:23.175
Come on, Chas. Have another drink.

49:31.145 --> 49:33.454
What's the story with you and that cop?

49:35.665 --> 49:37.542
Who? Gino?

49:39.505 --> 49:42.542
The one you popped.
Was that business?

49:42.865 --> 49:44.583
Or was it personaI?

49:48.025 --> 49:49.538
It was personaI business.

49:55.065 --> 49:56.214
HoIy shit!

49:56.425 --> 49:58.620
Why are you asking me
about my business?

49:58.865 --> 50:00.742
Richie, cops! Cops!

50:01.345 --> 50:02.619
You rat me out?

50:02.825 --> 50:03.701
No, never.

50:03.985 --> 50:04.940
You rat bastard!

50:05.185 --> 50:06.698
I'd never rat you out.

50:07.865 --> 50:10.857
-I'II put you out of your misery.
-PIease, don't!

50:19.705 --> 50:21.980
-Get your hands up!
-Nobody move!

50:23.065 --> 50:26.740
Why did you have to shoot him?
He didn't rat us out.

51:24.385 --> 51:25.340
How you doing?

51:25.585 --> 51:28.782
You arrest Patricia because
she no heIp you find Richard.

51:28.985 --> 51:32.580
Yeah, but just the same,
maybe we couId taIk a minute.

51:36.665 --> 51:39.099
You sit down right over here.

51:50.465 --> 51:52.581
This is difficuIt for me to say.

51:53.185 --> 51:55.699
I'm sorry for the way
I behaved in your home.

51:55.905 --> 51:59.693
It was disrespectfuI.
You've aIways been Iike a father to me.

52:00.745 --> 52:02.463
If you teII me. . .

52:03.185 --> 52:06.541
. . .that you haven't seen Richie,
I beIieve you. We got probIems.

52:10.945 --> 52:12.583
I know that it's--

52:12.865 --> 52:15.095
No man wants to bury his son.

52:16.985 --> 52:18.213
And I know. . .

52:18.745 --> 52:21.020
. . .no man wants to admit
that his son. . .

52:21.225 --> 52:23.580
. . .has become something
the worId can do without.

52:25.625 --> 52:27.104
But I'm very afraid. . .

52:28.385 --> 52:31.263
. . .every moment
for everyone around us.

52:33.305 --> 52:34.704
I pray. . .

52:35.465 --> 52:37.103
. . .for this to end.

52:39.505 --> 52:41.621
I know what you're trying to say.

52:53.145 --> 52:57.775
I'm gonna have to
make you stay downtown tonight.

53:13.665 --> 53:16.657
Jerry, that's robbery, not narcotics.

53:17.545 --> 53:20.617
TaIk to Donziger and get back to me.

53:20.985 --> 53:22.543
I'II taIk to you.

53:39.105 --> 53:41.096
Does this Iook famiIiar?

53:49.225 --> 53:50.977
I heIp you, he'II kiII me.

53:51.305 --> 53:52.897
He's your own brother!

53:53.105 --> 53:56.336
He's a vacuum.
He sucks up three to four grams a pass.

53:56.545 --> 53:58.900
That doesn't promote
rationaI thought.

53:59.785 --> 54:03.858
It'II get worse. I been teIIing you.
I got your father under arrest.

54:04.065 --> 54:05.896
It won't work, Gino!

54:06.145 --> 54:08.295
God, why don't you understand this?

54:09.585 --> 54:11.223
We can't heIp you.

54:11.465 --> 54:14.696
-If he thinks we did, he'II kiII Pop.
-He's that far gone?

54:14.945 --> 54:16.583
BeIieve it, Gino.

54:17.145 --> 54:18.498
Anybody.

54:18.985 --> 54:22.057
Then I'm gonna keep you here
tonight and keep you aIive.

54:22.265 --> 54:23.744
Hate me tomorrow.

54:30.985 --> 54:32.498
In the 8-0 precinct.

54:32.785 --> 54:37.142
Signal 1 01 3. Police officer shot.
6835 Amboy Street.

54:37.665 --> 54:41.544
This is one night this town
ain't ever gonna forget about.

54:41.745 --> 54:44.418
Ask me, I think you aIready
made sure of that.

54:44.665 --> 54:48.453
Your wife called.
She's at your apartment with Tony.

54:48.705 --> 54:51.503
Any chance you can swing over there
for a minute?

54:52.705 --> 54:55.503
I could do that.
I'm right in the area.

54:57.385 --> 54:59.945
Come here. Come over here.

55:03.545 --> 55:06.855
I aImost forgot about you.

55:07.265 --> 55:10.860
I gotta get you
a nice hot bath, some food.

55:11.305 --> 55:13.819
Maybe a girIfriend or something.

55:36.545 --> 55:37.421
How's Tony?

55:37.745 --> 55:38.575
He's fine.

55:41.265 --> 55:42.493
Have you eaten anything?

55:42.785 --> 55:44.901
A coupIe of dog biscuits.

55:45.225 --> 55:47.022
-My new dog.
-Look at you.

55:48.345 --> 55:50.905
-A poIice dog?
-This is Coraggio.

55:51.745 --> 55:52.814
You gonna keep him?

55:53.025 --> 55:54.663
I'm thinking about it.

55:55.745 --> 55:58.305
Maybe.
It depends on how brave he is.

56:00.785 --> 56:02.537
I better go and see Tony.

56:06.785 --> 56:08.821
You want to come up
for an espresso?

56:09.105 --> 56:11.414
Yeah. Why not?

56:12.305 --> 56:14.500
You stay there and be a good boy.

56:17.945 --> 56:22.143
-ShouId we show the dog to Tony?
-He'II never go back to sIeep.

56:22.345 --> 56:24.017
Did you ever have a dog?

56:24.265 --> 56:28.258
Are you kidding? We didn't have
enough money to feed ourseIves.

56:28.505 --> 56:32.703
There was this oId man who came
to the neighborhood when we were kids.

56:33.465 --> 56:35.501
He was from the oId country.

56:35.985 --> 56:38.135
Carried an oId schooI beII.

56:38.385 --> 56:43.095
He'd puII aIong this IittIe sharpening
machine operated by a foot peddIe.

56:44.305 --> 56:48.935
The neighbors used to come get
their knives and scissors sharpened.

56:49.185 --> 56:51.096
A dime here, a quarter there.

56:51.585 --> 56:53.496
But it was an honest Iiving.

56:53.825 --> 56:55.304
Time goes on. . .

56:55.545 --> 56:57.183
. . .peopIe start buying. . .

56:57.425 --> 57:00.064
. . .disposabIe scissors and knives.

57:00.665 --> 57:02.701
Fewer and fewer peopIe come out.

57:03.185 --> 57:04.937
I aIways used to think to myseIf. . .

57:05.385 --> 57:07.341
. . .how it wouId feeI to Ieave. . .

57:07.585 --> 57:09.257
. . .before Iight. . .

57:09.705 --> 57:11.502
. . .and come back after dark. . .

57:11.705 --> 57:15.903
. . .with nothing to show your wife
and famiIy for what you've done.

57:18.545 --> 57:22.174
That beII was the IoneIiest
sound I ever heard.

57:24.305 --> 57:25.943
He was your father?

57:28.585 --> 57:32.100
I remember one time I foIIowed
the oId man for a whoIe summer. . .

57:32.345 --> 57:33.539
. . .every day. . .

57:33.785 --> 57:35.264
. . .day in, day out.

57:37.465 --> 57:41.344
And after a whiIe,
it started to grind him down.

57:42.545 --> 57:45.503
Nobody. Nobody needs him, you know?

57:46.145 --> 57:48.500
You feeI Iike nobody needs you. . .

57:49.265 --> 57:51.096
. . .and you feeI useIess. . .

57:55.305 --> 57:57.102
. . .you die inside.

58:00.345 --> 58:02.142
You Iet yourseIf go.

58:03.425 --> 58:06.895
We aIways used to teII everybody,
''Pop died from cancer. ''

58:07.625 --> 58:09.695
I beIieve he died of a broken heart.

58:10.905 --> 58:12.577
After Pop died. . .

58:14.065 --> 58:17.694
. . .and the neighborhood kids wanted
to go to Coney IsIand to pIay. . .

58:18.985 --> 58:21.545
. . .one of the other fathers,
Mr. Madano. . .

58:21.785 --> 58:25.494
. . .used to sIip me a IittIe money so
I couId pIay with the kids too.

58:32.745 --> 58:37.102
You want to know how I repay
Mr. Madano, how I thanked him tonight?

58:38.065 --> 58:39.293
I arrested him.

58:40.065 --> 58:41.976
Just so I couId get to Richie.

58:43.585 --> 58:45.462
That's how crazy I get.

58:46.905 --> 58:50.739
Gino, these may be your streets
and your neighborhood. . .

58:52.105 --> 58:53.777
. . .but there are other cops.

58:55.465 --> 58:57.376
I'm reaIIy proud of what you do.

58:59.905 --> 59:02.100
And I know how everybody Ioves you.

59:02.985 --> 59:04.941
But Tony needs a father. . .

59:05.785 --> 59:07.377
. . .and I need a husband.

59:10.145 --> 59:13.103
Are we taIking
reconciIiation over here?

59:13.425 --> 59:15.939
No, we're taIking a Iifetime deaI.

59:16.625 --> 59:18.138
AII or nothing.

59:20.745 --> 59:22.019
I couId do that.

59:22.625 --> 59:24.058
That I couId do.

59:36.865 --> 59:38.139
I Iove you.

59:58.585 --> 01:00:00.701
-We need Tony!
-Get down in the bathtub!

01:00:00.905 --> 01:00:02.497
Okay. In the bathtub.

01:00:40.585 --> 01:00:41.734
You're dead.

01:00:50.425 --> 01:00:52.177
Come on, you rat bastard!

01:00:57.705 --> 01:00:58.774
Drop it!

01:01:00.265 --> 01:01:01.937
You'd shoot an unarmed man?

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:05.058
I wouIdn't.
You know what I'm gonna do?

01:01:05.305 --> 01:01:06.977
You motherfucker!

01:01:18.265 --> 01:01:21.894
Angie, send me units
over to my apartment.

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:25.023
There's been a shooting
over at my place.

01:01:25.305 --> 01:01:28.820
It's Richie Madano 's crew.
They're all deceased.

01:01:36.585 --> 01:01:39.418
They'II take you to a hoteI
with your mother.

01:01:42.185 --> 01:01:46.224
I know that this is not an easy thing,
and I know you're upset.

01:01:46.465 --> 01:01:48.376
I'II take care of it right away.

01:01:53.705 --> 01:01:54.581
Shit!

01:01:57.065 --> 01:01:58.054
FeIIas. . .

01:01:58.705 --> 01:01:59.581
. . .have a drink.

01:01:59.945 --> 01:02:01.014
Never mind that buIIshit.

01:02:01.225 --> 01:02:02.453
Sit down, dickhead.

01:02:03.425 --> 01:02:05.939
We're Iooking for your brother.
Where is he?

01:02:06.785 --> 01:02:08.503
He ain't been around.
I ain't seen him.

01:02:08.705 --> 01:02:10.218
You understand EngIish?

01:02:10.425 --> 01:02:12.063
Teach this guy some EngIish.

01:02:12.265 --> 01:02:14.938
You fucking bum!
Give me the right answer.

01:02:15.145 --> 01:02:17.500
Where's your fucking brother?
You cocksucker!

01:02:17.745 --> 01:02:19.497
I'II break your fucking head!

01:02:19.705 --> 01:02:23.857
You're both dead, you fucking bums!
The two of you! TeII him that!

01:02:24.065 --> 01:02:27.774
Say Rusty toId you you're dead!
You're dead, the two of you!

01:02:32.265 --> 01:02:33.584
You asshoIe!

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:43.495
Get the fuck out of here!

01:02:44.945 --> 01:02:46.697
Get the fuck out of here, man!

01:02:49.105 --> 01:02:51.494
I bet you're real popular
in your neighborhood now.

01:02:51.705 --> 01:02:54.856
Angie, I was never too popuIar
with my neighbors.

01:02:55.145 --> 01:02:56.624
I'm heading to I'Amore's now.

01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:15.544
Patti back yet?

01:03:16.105 --> 01:03:20.018
Can I taIk to you in private
for a minute, pIease? Over there.

01:03:22.825 --> 01:03:24.144
Sit over here.

01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:31.413
Is this you?

01:03:32.185 --> 01:03:33.459
My name's Terry MaIIoy.

01:03:33.665 --> 01:03:35.257
So who's Roxanne?

01:03:35.505 --> 01:03:37.894
Richie's girIfriend.
That who you're Iooking for?

01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:40.096
That is.
Where can I find her?

01:03:41.225 --> 01:03:44.262
I think she Iives here in BrookIyn,
but I don't know where.

01:03:44.465 --> 01:03:47.980
You don't know where. What are you,
a concerned citizen now?

01:03:48.185 --> 01:03:49.095
Why not?

01:03:49.345 --> 01:03:50.778
Who's Richie to you, anyway?

01:03:51.145 --> 01:03:52.658
A piece of shit.

01:03:53.825 --> 01:03:55.543
So how come you been crying?

01:03:57.185 --> 01:03:58.857
I got a fucking migraine.

01:04:01.465 --> 01:04:03.615
Listen, I want to ask you something.

01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:05.500
Do you know this girI?

01:04:10.985 --> 01:04:13.055
Maybe you couId sit over here.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:15.340
You aII right?

01:04:17.345 --> 01:04:18.334
Come on, Terry.

01:04:20.785 --> 01:04:22.264
You have to taIk to me.

01:04:25.785 --> 01:04:27.059
Who is it?

01:04:27.305 --> 01:04:28.943
It's Roxanne.

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:32.816
And you were fucking Bobby
at the same time?

01:04:33.225 --> 01:04:36.023
Don't be that way.
Come on. SettIe down.

01:04:41.145 --> 01:04:42.294
She got a Iast name?

01:04:42.825 --> 01:04:44.497
Ford. Roxanne Ford.

01:05:22.545 --> 01:05:24.137
How you doing, Vermeer?

01:05:26.065 --> 01:05:29.182
How the heII did you get up here?
Jesus Christ!

01:05:31.745 --> 01:05:33.815
He didn't have nothing to do with it.

01:05:44.825 --> 01:05:49.615
Where you been? We been waiting
around here aII night for you.

01:05:54.225 --> 01:05:56.056
What you been waiting on?

01:05:57.745 --> 01:05:58.780
What?

01:05:59.305 --> 01:06:01.102
Waiting on if you need us.

01:06:01.305 --> 01:06:02.818
What happened to your nose?

01:06:05.065 --> 01:06:08.421
Gino came around, pIaying the roIe.
Busting up the pIace.

01:06:08.705 --> 01:06:10.423
What, you ain't got a piece?

01:06:12.785 --> 01:06:14.582
You got a piece behind the bar.

01:06:14.985 --> 01:06:17.863
You Iet him do that to your face?
Why didn't you whack him?

01:06:18.185 --> 01:06:21.336
AII I heard was you cIipped Bobby.
Now I gotta whack a cop too?

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:25.457
Nobody has to worry about you
stepping on your dick.

01:06:28.465 --> 01:06:32.504
You know how wacko he gets!
And with you doing Bobby Iike that!

01:06:33.025 --> 01:06:37.223
You're mistaking me
for someone that gives a shit.

01:06:37.785 --> 01:06:41.414
If Gino and me bang heads,
he'II be racked in a cIosed casket.

01:06:43.665 --> 01:06:46.225
You saying you won't
Iet him take you?

01:06:46.865 --> 01:06:48.218
What are you, a cIown?

01:06:50.065 --> 01:06:52.295
Take me? Take me where?

01:06:59.705 --> 01:07:01.935
You Iet one motherfucker take you!

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:06.861
It ain't just Gino. BuIIs are banging
doors aII over the neighborhood.

01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:09.583
Frankie's guys are back!

01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:14.182
Them too! Every coupIe of hours
a different bunch comes sIapping me.

01:07:14.425 --> 01:07:16.859
Stop whining Iike a cunt
and get your piece.

01:07:22.985 --> 01:07:23.895
I can't.

01:07:26.705 --> 01:07:28.582
Don't Iet me see you again.

01:07:30.305 --> 01:07:33.217
Don't ever fucking
Iet me see you again.

01:07:40.025 --> 01:07:42.619
Good evening, feIIas.
Nice to see you again.

01:07:43.705 --> 01:07:46.139
Never mind the buIIshit.
Where the fuck is he?

01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:47.580
Over here, SaI.

01:08:03.505 --> 01:08:04.824
You Iose.

01:09:25.904 --> 01:09:27.179
Who's she?

01:09:28.705 --> 01:09:32.175
She brought me to the girIfriend.
She just identified the body. . .

01:09:32.385 --> 01:09:34.615
. . .so she's a IittIe upset.

01:09:35.145 --> 01:09:37.658
Did you have breakfast this morning?

01:09:38.505 --> 01:09:40.541
Good. Because it ain't pretty.

01:09:51.585 --> 01:09:54.895
-What is it?
-They kiIIed AIIie and three of the guys.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.583
It's no good.

01:09:57.985 --> 01:09:58.895
Let's find Richie.

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:05.740
O'KeIIy, get upstairs and make them
photograph that thing right.

01:10:05.945 --> 01:10:07.424
You got it.

01:10:12.185 --> 01:10:15.097
This is what I found in Bobby's desk.

01:10:15.985 --> 01:10:20.024
Bobby was doing this one and
the one in the car at the same time.

01:10:20.585 --> 01:10:24.624
From the extreme rigor mortis
in the body, it Iooks Iike. . .

01:10:24.825 --> 01:10:28.022
. . .time of death, 24 hours ago.
Before Bobby.

01:10:30.265 --> 01:10:32.301
I'm getting too oId for this shit.

01:10:32.505 --> 01:10:34.018
I know what you mean.

01:10:59.705 --> 01:11:01.821
Keep it down.
My sister's sIeeping.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:05.859
Wake her up.
We ain't disturbing you, are we?

01:11:06.505 --> 01:11:08.097
Rica, come here.

01:11:08.585 --> 01:11:10.337
We're wanting a IittIe party.

01:11:12.665 --> 01:11:14.257
I want a IittIe party.

01:11:14.505 --> 01:11:16.973
Kind of my going-away party.
Right, Bobby?

01:11:17.185 --> 01:11:18.584
Right, Rich.

01:11:18.825 --> 01:11:21.293
You ain't got a probIem
with that, do you?

01:11:21.505 --> 01:11:22.904
No, Rich. No probIem.

01:11:32.425 --> 01:11:34.416
Angie? Get me Gino.
It's PicoIino.

01:11:34.705 --> 01:11:38.493
CaII up WiIIy the Pimp.
Have him send over his best broads.

01:11:38.705 --> 01:11:41.663
Nobody wiII say you hung out
with me just for the money.

01:11:48.025 --> 01:11:49.663
Richie, pIease. Come on.

01:11:52.705 --> 01:11:54.696
I'II take care of you.

01:11:54.905 --> 01:11:56.623
I'II take care of you.

01:11:58.905 --> 01:11:59.894
Hey, boys!

01:12:00.905 --> 01:12:03.499
We're gonna have us
a good time tonight.

01:12:03.825 --> 01:12:06.020
Big time, Richie. Big time.

01:12:06.265 --> 01:12:09.223
It's my night! My Iast night!

01:12:14.585 --> 01:12:15.734
Who is it?

01:12:25.505 --> 01:12:26.540
How you doing, Laura?

01:12:26.785 --> 01:12:29.458
Good. Okay.
I couIdn't sIeep after Vick Ieft.

01:12:29.705 --> 01:12:32.173
So I had a bath.
I'm better now.

01:12:42.385 --> 01:12:44.023
What are you doing?

01:12:44.305 --> 01:12:46.023
What are you Iooking for?

01:12:47.265 --> 01:12:49.460
No! No, Gino, that's my purse.

01:12:49.705 --> 01:12:51.775
Give me that. Gino, stop!

01:12:58.385 --> 01:12:59.215
What's this?

01:13:01.505 --> 01:13:02.824
What is this?

01:13:03.025 --> 01:13:05.858
Is this what Richie threw on Bobby
after he shot him?

01:13:06.985 --> 01:13:08.213
That was fast thinking.

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:10.855
Just Iike a good cop's wife wouId.

01:13:12.905 --> 01:13:14.258
You know what I think?

01:13:14.465 --> 01:13:16.501
I think you found this somewhere. . .

01:13:16.705 --> 01:13:18.980
. . .and got so mad
you couIdn't see straight.

01:13:19.265 --> 01:13:24.180
And you sent one to Richie, never
dreaming he might actuaIIy kiII Bobby.

01:13:26.105 --> 01:13:28.699
I took it because
I wanted to protect him.

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:32.094
See, this is Roxanne, here.

01:13:32.505 --> 01:13:36.293
Twenty-four years oId.
Richie kiIIed her first.

01:13:36.505 --> 01:13:38.496
No. You got it aII wrong.

01:13:38.985 --> 01:13:41.738
I onIy took it
so peopIe wouIdn't know.

01:13:41.945 --> 01:13:43.424
Bobby was dirty, wasn't he?

01:13:44.225 --> 01:13:45.658
Or maybe. . .

01:13:45.945 --> 01:13:49.017
. . .he was just doing Richie's
girIfriend at the same time.

01:13:49.305 --> 01:13:50.624
I don't think so.

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:55.014
I think Bobby aIways wanted
to be Iike somebody eIse.

01:13:55.225 --> 01:13:59.423
He Iiked Richie's IifestyIe, his money.
And you knew he was dirty.

01:13:59.905 --> 01:14:02.214
Bobby's gone now.
So are Iots of others.

01:14:02.425 --> 01:14:04.541
I didn't want to kiII him.

01:14:04.785 --> 01:14:07.219
I just wanted to save my marriage.

01:14:07.665 --> 01:14:09.144
Come here, Laura.

01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:13.619
I want my Bobby back.

01:14:14.025 --> 01:14:15.663
I want him back.

01:14:20.825 --> 01:14:23.498
You have an emergency phone call
from Picolino.

01:14:23.705 --> 01:14:25.536
Patch me through right now.

01:14:33.065 --> 01:14:35.943
Listen to me, PicoIino.
I know that pIace.

01:14:36.465 --> 01:14:38.501
Get out of the neighborhood. Now.

01:15:45.265 --> 01:15:46.618
You in or out?

01:15:46.985 --> 01:15:48.179
I'm in.

01:17:38.665 --> 01:17:40.257
Hands on the fucking tabIe!

01:17:40.465 --> 01:17:41.534
