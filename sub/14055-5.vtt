WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:02.200
Listen, I just want
to tell you

00:02.267 --> 00:03.101
I don't want to talk.

00:03.168 --> 00:04.233
Okay, I'm fine with this.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.667
SUMMER:
Zack, will you wait, please?

00:05.734 --> 00:06.667
Beat it.

00:06.734 --> 00:08.101
Ducky!

00:08.167 --> 00:09.200
I'd really like to try

00:09.267 --> 00:09.967
and be something.

00:11.267 --> 00:12.767
I didn't marry you for money.

00:12.834 --> 00:14.034
You married me
because you were pregnant.

00:14.101 --> 00:14.834
I married you

00:14.901 --> 00:15.967
because I loved you.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.801
If my dad is acting all weird,

00:17.867 --> 00:18.967
he's hiding something.

00:19.034 --> 00:20.168
Are you having an affair?

00:20.233 --> 00:21.400
We're in much deeper water
than that.

00:21.467 --> 00:22.801
You think I'm cute.

00:22.867 --> 00:24.767
When I asked you out that day
for Seth,

00:24.834 --> 00:25.767
I wanted it to be me.

00:25.834 --> 00:27.034
You are an idiot.

00:27.101 --> 00:28.767
An idiot you'd go out with
sometime?

00:28.834 --> 00:30.001
It's possible.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.068
SETH:
So Alex and I kissed

00:37.134 --> 00:38.967
and you spent the whole night
on the bus stop

00:39.034 --> 00:40.434
talking to Lindsay.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.233
I know. Somehow the
double date worked out.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.634
Yeah, I'm proud of you.

00:43.701 --> 00:45.567
So what's next
for you two lovebirds, huh?

00:45.634 --> 00:47.200
Maybe chatting
at the train station?

00:47.267 --> 00:49.500
Whispering sweet nothings
at the airport?

00:49.567 --> 00:52.068
Ryan, I'm working off
the bus stop motif, bro.

00:52.134 --> 00:53.734
Yeah, I got it.

00:53.801 --> 00:55.134
I don't know what's next.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.267
I'm just going to take
things slow, no pressure.

00:56.333 --> 00:57.534
Yeah?
Yeah.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.934
What about asking her
to the big dance?

01:01.634 --> 01:02.667
Oh, no,
the winter dance.

01:02.734 --> 01:03.801
Yeah, do it, man.

01:03.867 --> 01:04.733
I'm going to take Alex.
So take Lindsay.

01:04.801 --> 01:05.767
We can have
the double date

01:05.834 --> 01:07.034
that we were supposed
to have.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.567
Ah, it just seems
a little soon.

01:08.634 --> 01:10.467
I mean, what if she's had
the weekend to think about it,

01:10.534 --> 01:12.200
and just decides we
should be lab partners?

01:12.267 --> 01:13.333
All we did was talk.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.367
Ryan Atwood--
are you scared of a girl?

01:15.434 --> 01:17.801
No, I just...
I might like her and...

01:17.867 --> 01:19.200
I don't know, every time
there's a big party to go to...

01:19.267 --> 01:20.667
Something goes terribly awry?

01:20.734 --> 01:22.001
Yeah.
Yeah, but usually to you.

01:22.068 --> 01:23.767
Maybe this is my year
to shoulder that part.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.367
You're not really
the fist-fighting type.

01:25.434 --> 01:27.101
Well, you're not really
the type to be scared of a girl.

01:27.168 --> 01:28.367
Just ask her
to the dance.

01:28.434 --> 01:30.134
It's the only way
to know how she feels.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.934
Maybe I'll just go alone.

01:34.001 --> 01:35.600
SUMMER:
Coop, you cannot go alone.

01:35.667 --> 01:38.168
Why not?
It's just a school dance.

01:38.233 --> 01:39.967
It is not just
a school dance.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.634
It is the "Sno.C."

01:41.701 --> 01:44.600
The one night where winter
comes to Newport Beach.

01:44.667 --> 01:47.001
And your first dance of
the year as social chair.

01:47.068 --> 01:48.467
What happened to DJ?

01:48.534 --> 01:50.101
Oh, I didn't ask him.

01:50.168 --> 01:51.967
My mom's chairing
the host committee.

01:52.034 --> 01:53.233
She'd freak.

01:53.300 --> 01:54.500
Your mom
doesn't like him?

01:54.567 --> 01:55.734
She doesn't know
about him.

01:55.801 --> 01:57.168
It's not his type
of thing anyway.

01:57.233 --> 01:58.168
( door opening )

01:58.233 --> 01:59.701
Hi.

01:59.767 --> 02:01.734
Hey, guys, you still haven't
bought your Sno.C. tickets yet,

02:01.801 --> 02:02.901
so can I put you down
for four?

02:02.967 --> 02:03.901
Yeah, I don't know
about that.

02:03.967 --> 02:05.134
Ah, you should take the Mrs.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.068
Why, Cohen, you should
invite the girl

02:07.134 --> 02:08.068
from Saturday night.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.800
Yeah... Oh, I forgot.

02:09.866 --> 02:11.600
She totally pulled
a Houdini on your ass.

02:11.667 --> 02:12.934
SETH:
Oh, right.

02:13.001 --> 02:14.767
You must be talking
about Lindsay, not Alex,

02:14.834 --> 02:17.168
the one I... made out with.

02:17.233 --> 02:18.101
Oh, sorry.

02:18.168 --> 02:19.567
Alex, my mistake.

02:19.634 --> 02:21.200
And here I'm feeling
sorry for the wrong girl.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.500
I should probably get to class.

02:22.567 --> 02:23.834
You know, you just
really should make sure

02:23.901 --> 02:25.267
she wears comfortable
shoes, so she doesn't

02:25.333 --> 02:27.068
twist her ankle when
she's running away.

02:27.134 --> 02:28.600
Yeah? L-Like him?

02:28.667 --> 02:30.567
Zach!

02:30.634 --> 02:32.600
Wait.

02:32.667 --> 02:35.134
That worked out rather nicely.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.233

03:08.333 --> 03:09.201
Caleb, it's me.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.801
I still haven't heard back from you

03:10.867 --> 03:12.268
about setting up another meeting

03:12.333 --> 03:14.801
with Renee Wheeler
and her attorney.

03:14.867 --> 03:17.300
So, do me a favor
and call me back, will you?

03:17.367 --> 03:18.967
How about some eggs?

03:19.034 --> 03:21.333
You okay?

03:21.400 --> 03:22.400
Yeah.

03:22.467 --> 03:23.700
How about an omelet?

03:23.767 --> 03:26.067
I know I'm not supposed
to ask about the case...

03:26.134 --> 03:28.134
Honey, even if I could talk
about it,

03:28.201 --> 03:29.367
I'd have nothing to tell you.

03:29.433 --> 03:30.367
Dad's still not talking.

03:30.433 --> 03:31.600
What could
he possibly have done

03:31.667 --> 03:32.867
that he would rather
go to jail

03:32.934 --> 03:34.201
than admit to?

03:34.268 --> 03:36.934
Unless...

03:37.001 --> 03:39.034
Life with Julie Cooper
is tougher than we thought.

03:39.101 --> 03:39.967
What are you going to do?

03:40.034 --> 03:42.433
The only thing I can do.

03:42.500 --> 03:46.467
Ask for a continuance...
buy some time and...

03:46.534 --> 03:48.867
find out what he's hiding.

04:00.433 --> 04:02.300
Hey...
how you doing?

04:02.367 --> 04:05.034
Hey, uh, good.
I'm, I'm good.

04:05.101 --> 04:09.634
Um... I thought about
what you said all weekend,

04:09.700 --> 04:11.734
and you were so sweet

04:11.801 --> 04:13.400
and so honest.

04:13.467 --> 04:16.067
I'm glad, 'cause, um,
there's this dance.

04:16.134 --> 04:17.399
Uh, yeah.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.733
Um, no.

04:19.801 --> 04:23.867
I mean, I would love
to go out with you,

04:23.934 --> 04:26.567
but we're in
the same class,

04:26.634 --> 04:28.067
and can you imagine
how awkward

04:28.134 --> 04:29.467
it's gonna be
if we break up?

04:29.534 --> 04:32.201
We haven't even gone out yet.

04:32.268 --> 04:33.567
And it's
already awkward.

04:33.634 --> 04:36.567
Let's face it, relationships
almost always end badly.

04:36.634 --> 04:39.734
And this way,
we can be friends

04:39.801 --> 04:40.901
for the rest of our lives.

04:40.967 --> 04:43.901
So, you just want
to be friends?

04:43.967 --> 04:46.201
I think we should be.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.500
( cell phone ringing )

05:00.567 --> 05:01.634
Hello?

05:01.700 --> 05:03.168
Hey, is now a bad time?

05:03.234 --> 05:05.700
Well, where are you?

05:05.767 --> 05:07.201
I'm in the parking lot.

05:07.268 --> 05:09.300
You think you can
get away for lunch?

05:09.367 --> 05:12.901
I really like our lunch breaks.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.867
So what's this Sno.C.?

05:22.934 --> 05:26.001
It's just this dance.

05:26.067 --> 05:27.433
We never get snow here,

05:27.500 --> 05:30.034
so we kind of
have to make it ourselves.

05:30.101 --> 05:32.801
Mm, sounds like fun.

05:32.867 --> 05:35.168
Actually, it's very Harbor.

05:35.234 --> 05:37.333
You'd probably hate it.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.134
I guess it's a good thing
that no one's asked me, then.

05:39.201 --> 05:42.234
I would've; it's just
I'm kind of running it,

05:42.300 --> 05:44.567
so I figured... You don't
want to be distracted

05:44.634 --> 05:46.134
by having to--
I don't know--

05:46.201 --> 05:47.534
finally introduce me
to your friends?

05:47.600 --> 05:49.400
I'm sorry.

05:49.467 --> 05:52.300
But I figured I'd be so busy,
I'd be a bad date.

05:52.367 --> 05:55.034
If you...
It's cool.

05:55.101 --> 05:57.234
I'd rather be alone
with you anyway.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.001
Well, we could
go out afterward.

06:01.067 --> 06:03.067
Or we could just stay in.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.467
( sighing )

06:23.700 --> 06:24.867
Marissa?

06:24.934 --> 06:25.667
Oh, my God.

06:26.634 --> 06:27.700
The yard guy?

06:27.767 --> 06:28.834
Mom...

06:28.901 --> 06:29.867
What are you doing home
from school?

06:29.934 --> 06:31.967
I'm on my lunch break.

06:32.034 --> 06:33.168
And now,
if you'll excuse me,

06:33.234 --> 06:35.300
I have to get back.

06:35.367 --> 06:36.801
I've got to get to work.

06:36.867 --> 06:38.168
No, you don't. You're fired.

06:38.234 --> 06:39.201
And you, young lady,

06:39.268 --> 06:40.400
are grounded.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.168
Like that's going to keep me
from seeing him.

06:42.234 --> 06:43.567
Come on, DJ.

06:45.433 --> 06:48.134
You stay away from my daughter,
you hear me?

06:52.067 --> 06:54.001
Oh, thanks, Michelle.
Did my dad call?

06:54.067 --> 06:55.767
No, but Julie's called
several times. Hey.

06:55.834 --> 06:58.667
Hey. How'd it go
with the judge?

06:58.734 --> 07:00.934
Well, not only was my motion
for a continuance denied,

07:01.001 --> 07:02.801
but the trial's
now been fast-tracked.

07:02.867 --> 07:04.934
We've got less
than two weeks.

07:05.001 --> 07:07.034
I'm calling Caleb again.

07:07.101 --> 07:08.634
How could I have
not seen this coming?

07:08.700 --> 07:10.767
Honey, come on,
how could you have?

07:10.834 --> 07:12.967
WOMAN: Your call has
been forwarded to an...

07:13.034 --> 07:14.967
I've been working with him
side by side all this time.

07:15.034 --> 07:17.101
How could I have not known
that he was bribing this woman

07:17.168 --> 07:18.168
from the city council?

07:18.234 --> 07:19.634
If that is what he was doing.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.168
What did she say
at her deposition?

07:21.234 --> 07:23.234
Nothing. Her lawyer wouldn't let
her answer any of my questions.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.734
You can't talk to her
without a lawyer.

07:24.801 --> 07:26.667
Well... I could.

07:26.734 --> 07:28.001
That would be unethical.

07:28.067 --> 07:29.300
Yeah,
strictly speaking.

07:29.367 --> 07:30.500
But desperate times...

07:30.567 --> 07:31.801
I'm just saying,

07:31.867 --> 07:33.734
if I happen to run
into the woman.

07:33.801 --> 07:36.467
I don't want you getting
yourself in trouble over this.

07:36.534 --> 07:38.067
Aw, honey...

07:39.367 --> 07:41.400
it's a little late for that.

07:44.433 --> 07:45.901
( sighs )

07:45.967 --> 07:48.433
( laughing )

07:50.168 --> 07:51.600
Hey, Ryan.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.234
You know where I can
buy my Sno.C. tickets?

07:53.300 --> 07:54.300
I can't say I do.

07:54.367 --> 07:55.300
You're not going?

07:55.367 --> 07:56.268
Uh, no.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.268
No one to go with?

07:57.333 --> 07:59.034
I had someone to go with.

07:59.101 --> 08:00.734
She just didn't want
to go with me.

08:00.801 --> 08:02.600
Uh, what's up?
You going with someone?

08:02.667 --> 08:04.367
Definitely.
It's a given, right?

08:04.433 --> 08:06.034
Except, of course,
for Cohen?

08:06.101 --> 08:09.134
I don't think
he's asking Summer.

08:09.201 --> 08:11.168
I don't think he has to.

08:11.234 --> 08:12.567
I mean,
even if he doesn't ask her,

08:12.634 --> 08:14.367
somehow, the night's going
to end up about them.

08:14.433 --> 08:16.201
Yeah, I get that.

08:16.268 --> 08:17.500
Believe me.

08:17.567 --> 08:18.667
But, uh, I think
it's really over.

08:18.734 --> 08:20.001
I mean,
Seth's got a new girl now.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.600
Really.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.034
So he's over Summer?

08:23.101 --> 08:24.067
Oh, yeah, definitely.

08:25.567 --> 08:28.367
I think so.

08:28.433 --> 08:30.400
He wants to be.

08:38.234 --> 08:40.467
Oh, hello, Alex.

08:40.534 --> 08:41.667
How are we today?

08:41.734 --> 08:42.900
Here, finally.

08:42.967 --> 08:44.467
Can you carry these
to the storeroom?

08:44.534 --> 08:46.500
The storeroom, sure.

08:46.567 --> 08:50.034
Maybe you'd like
to show me where it is?

08:50.101 --> 08:52.500
All right, Cohen,
we need to work.

08:52.567 --> 08:53.901
Okay, by work,
you mean

08:53.967 --> 08:55.567
( clearing throat ):
make out?

08:55.634 --> 08:56.767
No.

08:56.834 --> 08:58.467
By work, I mean work.

08:58.534 --> 09:01.767
All right, no romance
in the workplace.

09:01.834 --> 09:03.767
That's fine. I can respect that.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.168
But in that case,

09:05.234 --> 09:07.801
Harbor School's annual
Sno.C. Ball is coming up.

09:07.867 --> 09:09.134
What do you say?

09:09.201 --> 09:10.834
A little dancing,
a little faux snow?

09:10.901 --> 09:13.634
Obviously you got the
wrong idea Saturday night,

09:13.700 --> 09:15.034
because you and me--

09:15.101 --> 09:17.001
it's not happening.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.534
Okay.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.867
Okay, except you did
kind of kiss me.

09:20.934 --> 09:22.867
Uh-huh. It was fun.

09:22.934 --> 09:23.700
It was fun?

09:23.767 --> 09:24.700
That's it?Yeah.

09:24.767 --> 09:26.168
It didn't mean
anything to you?

09:26.234 --> 09:27.534
Dude, it was just a kiss.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.400
Okay, then why didn't
you just shake hands?

09:34.901 --> 09:36.067
Thanks, Homer.

09:36.134 --> 09:37.367
See you Thursday.

09:37.433 --> 09:38.500
Thank you.

09:39.901 --> 09:41.333
You just kissed the beer guy.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.400
So? It is just a kiss.

09:43.467 --> 09:44.467
Right, Mandy?

09:48.901 --> 09:50.234
Right.

09:51.667 --> 09:54.234
So, Saturday night was fun,

09:54.300 --> 09:56.001
but that's all.

09:56.067 --> 09:58.367
Those sodas aren't going
to carry themselves

09:58.433 --> 09:59.467
to the store room.

10:06.134 --> 10:08.568
Do you think it's offensive

10:08.634 --> 10:10.900
to say that, like,
all women are crazy?

10:10.967 --> 10:12.134
Probably to women.

10:12.201 --> 10:13.967
It makes no sense, man,
Alex kisses me,

10:14.034 --> 10:16.334
then she turns right around
and she kisses Homer.

10:16.401 --> 10:17.334
Who's Homer?

10:17.401 --> 10:18.401
The beer guy.

10:18.467 --> 10:19.867
And he's not
a looker either.

10:19.934 --> 10:23.034
And then after that, she turns
right around and kisses Mandy.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.434
Mandy's a girl?

10:24.501 --> 10:25.501
Yeah.
Wow...

10:25.568 --> 10:27.234
No, I couldn't even enjoy it,

10:27.301 --> 10:29.800
so consumed was I with
how crazy women are.

10:29.867 --> 10:31.267
Ugh. Believe me, I know.

10:31.334 --> 10:32.700
I spent all night
at a bus stop

10:32.767 --> 10:34.367
talking to Lindsay,
everything's great.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.568
Next thing I know,

10:35.634 --> 10:37.034
she dumps me before
we even go out.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.067
Crazy.

10:38.134 --> 10:39.301
I know.

10:39.367 --> 10:40.601
I know.

10:40.668 --> 10:43.601
I'm telling you, man,
women are so freaking crazy,

10:43.668 --> 10:45.934
I wouldn't be surprised
if next time we see them,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.668
Alex is dragging me
to the store room

10:47.733 --> 10:49.501
and Lindsay's asking you
to the dance.

10:49.568 --> 10:50.934
I don't think so.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.401
Which part, you and Lindsay
or me and Alex getting it on?

10:55.134 --> 10:56.234
Hey!

10:56.301 --> 10:57.234
Hey.

10:57.301 --> 10:58.467
SETH:
How are you?

10:58.534 --> 11:00.267
You need a hand
with something?

11:00.334 --> 11:01.501
Sure.
All right.

11:01.568 --> 11:03.634
Ryan, be a gentleman.
I've got class.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.668
What do you
need me to grab?

11:05.733 --> 11:07.568
Um, in my car is a penguin.

11:07.634 --> 11:08.967
A penguin?

11:11.800 --> 11:13.401
Be careful.

11:13.467 --> 11:14.700
Uh, don't worry, I'm fine.

11:14.767 --> 11:16.401
It's the penguin
I'm worried about.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.401
He's very expensive.

11:17.467 --> 11:18.967
Oh, is he?

11:19.034 --> 11:21.100
Well, oh, oh, oh.
Ryan, please, no, don't.

11:21.167 --> 11:24.334
The penguin likes Marissa!
That's not funny!

11:24.401 --> 11:25.634
( laughing )

11:25.700 --> 11:27.900
Stop. Seriously.

11:27.967 --> 11:29.601
It's not too late.

11:29.668 --> 11:32.867
You can still ask
him to the Sno.C.

11:32.934 --> 11:34.934
Ahh!
( laughing )

11:35.000 --> 11:37.467
You have no idea how hard it is... Ohh!

11:37.534 --> 11:39.301
The boy loves to dance.

11:39.367 --> 11:41.733
He's going to think
I'm crazy.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.634
Oh, ho, ho, he knows you're
a girl. He expects it.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.568
Mm, I have your tickets
for the dance.

11:53.634 --> 11:56.100
And no arguements, okay?
Because it's for charity.

11:56.167 --> 11:58.034
If I buy the thing,
do I have to go?

11:58.100 --> 11:59.967
I'm kind of dateless
at the moment.

12:00.034 --> 12:03.167
Yeah, me, too.

12:03.234 --> 12:04.267
What about you and DJ?

12:04.334 --> 12:05.601
I thought you guys were...

12:05.668 --> 12:07.201
We're hanging out, but...

12:07.267 --> 12:10.767
It's a school dance and I
think he'd feel weird about it.

12:10.833 --> 12:12.934
Hey, it's my school
and I feel weird about it.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.301
Yeah, me, too, and I'm the one
throwing the thing.

12:15.367 --> 12:16.867
I guess you can't not go, huh?

12:16.934 --> 12:17.767
I wish.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.301
Hey, you know what?
Why don't we go together?

12:21.367 --> 12:22.733
As friends, of course.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.934
But, at least that way,
we wouldn't have to be alone.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.501
That's true.

12:26.568 --> 12:27.867
Great, so 7:00 is good?

12:35.867 --> 12:39.601
Hello, Summer.
You look lovely today.

12:39.668 --> 12:40.668
Are those Manolos?

12:40.733 --> 12:41.700
What do you need, Cohen?

12:41.767 --> 12:42.767
Well, I need help.

12:42.833 --> 12:43.967
No argument here.

12:44.034 --> 12:46.367
See, it turns out Ryan's
good for some things.

12:46.434 --> 12:49.434
Um... comic books, bench-
pressing, engine repair,

12:49.501 --> 12:51.134
but sometimes a more feminine

12:51.201 --> 12:52.568
point of view is required.

12:52.634 --> 12:54.568
You're asking me
for girl advice?

12:54.634 --> 12:56.367
I know it's really weird,
because you know,

12:56.434 --> 12:58.434
you and I are not, anymore.
The thing is, Summer,

12:58.501 --> 13:01.134
truthfully, you're
the only person

13:01.201 --> 13:03.067
in my life that I...

13:04.934 --> 13:06.767
You're right, this is really
weird and bad.

13:06.833 --> 13:08.067
I'm sorry.

13:08.134 --> 13:10.134
No, it's...

13:10.201 --> 13:12.100
It's really, it's cool.

13:12.167 --> 13:12.934
It's okay. I'm listening.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.634
Really?
Kind of.

13:19.334 --> 13:21.134
Okay.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.134
All right, so you remember
that girl from Saturday, right?

13:23.201 --> 13:24.401
The one that I...

13:24.467 --> 13:26.967
You made out with and were
rubbing my nose in it.

13:27.034 --> 13:28.668
So I thought, you know,
she likes me, right?

13:28.733 --> 13:29.733
So I asked her to the dance.

13:29.800 --> 13:30.733
She said no.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.867
Right. And then she kissed

13:31.934 --> 13:33.134
two people
right in front of me.

13:33.201 --> 13:34.601
Damn, she's good.

13:34.668 --> 13:36.000
At what? Besides
kissing, though.

13:36.067 --> 13:39.767
Well, she's playing you hot
and cold, and so far, Cohen,

13:39.833 --> 13:41.434
you've just been hot.

13:41.501 --> 13:42.467
Summer.

13:42.534 --> 13:43.467
Not that kind of hot.

13:43.534 --> 13:45.301
You need
to cool down, Cohen.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.234
You've got to go like
Iceman on her ass

13:47.301 --> 13:48.534
and see how she likes it.

13:48.601 --> 13:50.134
Was that your first
X-Men reference?

13:50.201 --> 13:51.501
Top Gun.
Top Gun.

13:51.568 --> 13:53.000
Hey, that's one of the
greatest love stories

13:53.067 --> 13:54.034
of our time.

13:58.367 --> 13:59.867
It's funny because
you're the only person

13:59.934 --> 14:01.467
that would probably
ever pick up on that.

14:01.534 --> 14:03.767
Really? Why don't you try to
predicate it with some more, I think

14:03.833 --> 14:06.668
'cause if I... I think
I would break your...

14:08.501 --> 14:12.100
An F-14, uh, uh,
uh, uh, you know,

14:12.167 --> 14:14.067
downward dog.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.767
Ms. Wheeler!

14:29.833 --> 14:31.733
Sandy Cohen.
Caleb's attorney.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.067
Mr. Cohen, you know
I can't speak to you

14:33.134 --> 14:34.234
without my attorney present.

14:34.301 --> 14:35.267
With all due respect,
Ms. Wheeler,

14:35.334 --> 14:36.301
you didn't say a word to me

14:36.367 --> 14:37.434
when your attorney was present.

14:37.501 --> 14:38.534
I had nothing to say.

14:38.601 --> 14:40.167
I'm not the one on trial here.

14:40.234 --> 14:41.700
Then why'd the DA
indict you, too?

14:42.733 --> 14:43.767
Ask my lawyer.

14:43.833 --> 14:45.401
You're going to be
hearing from him

14:45.467 --> 14:46.900
as well as the Bar Association.

14:46.967 --> 14:47.967
Good-bye, Mr. Cohen.

14:48.034 --> 14:49.733
You're hiding something,
Ms. Wheeler?

14:49.800 --> 14:50.733
We both know it.

14:50.800 --> 14:51.934
Look, whatever is going on

14:52.000 --> 14:53.334
between you and Caleb...

14:53.401 --> 14:55.733
There is nothing going on
between me and Caleb.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.534
Oh, okay, well, there was.

14:57.601 --> 15:00.100
Wasn't there?

15:00.167 --> 15:02.733
So you had an affair, so what?
It's over.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.100
Why not come forward?

15:04.167 --> 15:06.301
Why risk both
of you going to jail

15:06.367 --> 15:08.267
over, over nothing?

15:08.334 --> 15:10.134
I have to go.
I'll see you in court.

15:16.501 --> 15:17.733
Hey.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.800
Hey.

15:22.833 --> 15:26.800
So, I've been
thinking and well...

15:26.867 --> 15:28.733
yes.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.833
I would love to go
to the dance with you.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.434
You would?

15:33.501 --> 15:34.601
Yes.

15:34.668 --> 15:35.867
Um...

15:35.934 --> 15:38.100
I'm kind of going
with someone else now.

15:38.167 --> 15:39.100
Oh.

15:39.167 --> 15:40.833
Yeah.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.501
With Marissa?

15:42.568 --> 15:43.501
Yeah.

15:43.568 --> 15:47.100
God... of course.

15:47.167 --> 15:48.401
But only because you said...

15:48.467 --> 15:49.434
No, no, I know.

15:49.501 --> 15:52.034
And I was right the first time.

15:52.100 --> 15:53.568
Really, I don't...

15:53.634 --> 15:58.067
I don't even like dances, so...

15:58.134 --> 16:00.900
Have fun.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.900
Hey. I missed you at lunch.

16:12.967 --> 16:14.100
Yeah, I was in the library.

16:14.167 --> 16:15.568
I had to finish a history paper.

16:15.634 --> 16:18.467
Oh, library, God,
how can you work in there?

16:18.534 --> 16:19.767
It is, like, so quiet.

16:19.833 --> 16:21.867
Look, I've got world lit
so I got to go.

16:21.934 --> 16:23.434
Well, hey, um, I was thinking,

16:23.501 --> 16:25.301
maybe before the dance,

16:25.367 --> 16:27.301
we could, like, go get...

16:27.367 --> 16:28.568
Yeah, about that.

16:28.634 --> 16:31.434
Um, it turns out I'm not
going to be able to go.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.800
I've got family stuff. Sorry.

16:34.867 --> 16:36.301
Okay.

16:36.367 --> 16:38.833
Well, unless you're, like,
grieving over the death

16:38.900 --> 16:41.100
of a family pet,
we're going to the Sno.C

16:41.167 --> 16:42.467
Why don't you just ask Cohen?

16:42.534 --> 16:44.100
I'm sure he'd love to take you.

16:53.601 --> 16:55.334
Hey, great, you're here!

16:55.401 --> 16:56.833
The floors need

16:56.900 --> 16:58.700
sweeping and mopping,
and I know how much

16:58.767 --> 17:00.234
you love cleaning
the bathrooms,

17:00.301 --> 17:01.601
so I saved them for you.

17:01.668 --> 17:04.434
But you can start with
clearing those empties.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.733
Great, I'll get right on it.

17:13.166 --> 17:16.166
( whistling tune )

17:18.667 --> 17:20.767
Not very chatty today, are ya?

17:20.833 --> 17:23.833
Uh, I don't know,

17:23.900 --> 17:25.900
is there something you wanted
to talk about?

17:25.967 --> 17:27.867
No. Not really.

17:27.934 --> 17:29.334
All right.

17:29.401 --> 17:32.267
( clears throat )

17:40.000 --> 17:41.234
You know what?

17:42.867 --> 17:45.367
There is something that
I think we should discuss.

17:46.434 --> 17:47.668
Here's the thing.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.900
Um, first of all,
I love working here.

17:50.967 --> 17:52.167
I do.

17:52.234 --> 17:53.900
But right now, for me,

17:53.967 --> 17:59.000
with school and homework,
and this dance coming up,

17:59.067 --> 18:01.601
I don't know that
I have time for a job.

18:01.668 --> 18:03.401
You're quitting?

18:03.467 --> 18:04.900
Yeah.

18:04.967 --> 18:07.434
Because I wouldn't make out
with you in the storeroom?

18:07.501 --> 18:10.067
What?

18:10.134 --> 18:11.100
No, just, come on.

18:11.167 --> 18:12.900
Listen, I asked you to a dance.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.434
You said no.

18:14.501 --> 18:17.267
I respect that,
okay? I do.

18:17.334 --> 18:19.134
I just... for me,

18:19.201 --> 18:22.100
I have just a lot of obligations
right now

18:22.167 --> 18:24.700
outside of the Bait Shop, so...

18:24.767 --> 18:27.067
You know.

18:27.134 --> 18:28.401
Okay.

18:28.467 --> 18:30.434
Okay.

18:36.568 --> 18:37.900
Um, this is what I owe you

18:37.967 --> 18:39.668
for the week, so...

18:39.733 --> 18:42.000
Okay, yeah, well, you know,
looks like it's...

18:42.067 --> 18:43.167
all there.

18:43.234 --> 18:44.733
It's been really great
working with you.

18:44.800 --> 18:49.067
With you. I mean,
you've been lovely, so...

18:49.134 --> 18:50.067
See ya.

18:50.134 --> 18:51.833
Yeah. Take care.

19:23.434 --> 19:28.034
Caleb, it is the lawyer leaving
you another message. Call me back,

19:28.134 --> 19:30.934
will you?
I've had a breakthrough.

19:31.001 --> 19:34.134
I was wondering what you
I've hadwanted to do tonight.

19:35.368 --> 19:36.368
You okay?

19:36.434 --> 19:38.034
Yeah, sure.
Are the boys still here?

19:38.101 --> 19:40.368
We should get some pictures
before they head out

19:40.434 --> 19:41.767
to the big dance.

19:41.834 --> 19:42.800
RYAN: Come on, buddy, get off your ass.

19:42.867 --> 19:43.867
Come to the party.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.434
Thank you, Ryan,

19:45.500 --> 19:47.334
but I'd like to just sit here
and watch my kung fu movie

19:47.401 --> 19:48.567
if you don't mind.

19:48.633 --> 19:50.201
Well, Marissa and I are
only going as friends;

19:50.267 --> 19:51.334
we can all go together.

19:51.401 --> 19:53.934
Aw, that is how lame
I've become.

19:54.001 --> 19:56.533
I can't even be third wheel
to an actual relationship.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.700
Aw.

19:57.767 --> 19:59.368
Whoa, look at you.

19:59.434 --> 20:01.533
Oh, you look sharp.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.633
So you taking
that girl

20:02.700 --> 20:03.767
that Seth was
telling me about?

20:03.834 --> 20:05.134
No, it didn't
really work out.

20:05.201 --> 20:07.900
Seth, why aren't
you dressed?

20:07.967 --> 20:10.001
Yeah. You're going to
be late for the party.

20:10.067 --> 20:11.468
Not the Seth Cohen
pity party.

20:11.533 --> 20:14.201
Could you guys maybe take
this discussion elsewhere?

20:14.267 --> 20:17.067
Samuel Hong's about to face off
with his arch nemesis.

20:17.134 --> 20:18.368
It's kind of a big deal.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.201
You know,

20:21.267 --> 20:22.934
I kind of feel
like kicking back

20:23.001 --> 20:23.900
with a good movie.

20:23.967 --> 20:24.867
Me, too.

20:24.934 --> 20:25.600
( groans )

20:25.667 --> 20:26.667
Yeah.

20:28.667 --> 20:29.834
So...

20:29.900 --> 20:31.368
what are we watching?

20:31.434 --> 20:34.533
( moaning and groaning )

20:34.600 --> 20:36.567
Masters of Martial Art.

20:36.633 --> 20:39.101
This is Masters
of Martial Art?

20:39.167 --> 20:40.500
Yes. I hear this is wonderful.

20:40.567 --> 20:42.434
Why is that ninja smoking a cigarette?

20:42.500 --> 20:45.834
Honey, honey, I don't
actually think that's a ninja.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.067
Ninjas usually
wear capes, right?

20:47.134 --> 20:50.468
Oh, so a ninja's
like a super hero.

20:50.533 --> 20:53.134
Mom, Dad, you two enjoy.

20:53.201 --> 20:54.434
Ryan, give me
five minutes.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.533
Where you going?

20:55.600 --> 20:57.034
Come on back!

20:57.101 --> 20:58.234
Nice work.

20:58.301 --> 21:00.734
Never underestimate
a parent's ability

21:00.800 --> 21:02.201
to mortify his child.

21:02.267 --> 21:03.800
So, no Sno.C. for DJ?

21:03.867 --> 21:05.867
With my mom
and dad hosting?

21:05.934 --> 21:07.934
He'll just
pick me up after.

21:08.001 --> 21:11.500
Then maybe Zach will show,
and we can all go out.

21:11.567 --> 21:13.167
I don't care
if Zach shows.

21:13.234 --> 21:16.134
In fact, honestly,
I would rather go by myself.

21:16.201 --> 21:17.401
Oh, really?

21:17.468 --> 21:18.434
Mm-hmm.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.434
You would?

21:19.500 --> 21:20.633
No.

21:20.700 --> 21:23.001
Good, 'cause you're going
with me and Ryan.

21:23.067 --> 21:25.234
Great, now I'm going
to be dragged along

21:25.301 --> 21:27.101
like the homely cousin
from Iowa.

21:27.167 --> 21:28.368
( knock at door )

21:28.434 --> 21:30.468
Well, you know, at least
I won't have to deal

21:30.533 --> 21:32.834
with Cohen knowing
that I'm going alone.

21:35.734 --> 21:37.101
Oh... God.

21:37.167 --> 21:39.234
Hello, Summer.

21:44.368 --> 21:45.368
Where's Zach?

21:52.167 --> 21:53.167
So, just like old times, huh?

21:53.234 --> 21:54.500
Seriously, man,

21:54.567 --> 21:57.600
four people and not one of us
could get a real date.

21:57.667 --> 21:59.334
I guess we're going
to win the awards

21:59.401 --> 22:01.034
for biggest losers
in Newport Beach.

22:01.101 --> 22:03.700
You must win
that award a lot.

22:03.767 --> 22:05.468
( mock laughter )

22:05.533 --> 22:07.067
I'm sorry.
Is Zach in here?

22:07.134 --> 22:08.500
Is he hiding somewhere?

22:08.567 --> 22:10.301
Zach? Zachary?

22:10.368 --> 22:12.567
Okay, at least he didn't kiss
two people right in front of me.

22:12.633 --> 22:13.800
Who did that?

22:13.867 --> 22:14.800
Seth's girlfriend.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.067
Oh! I'm sorry, that's right.

22:16.134 --> 22:17.101
She dumped you!

22:17.167 --> 22:18.267
Hoo-hoo.

22:18.334 --> 22:19.567
She kissed two guys
right in front of you?

22:19.633 --> 22:21.334
I think it was
What?!a guy and a girl.

22:21.401 --> 22:22.533
Thanks for that, buddy.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.234
Wait, she kissed
another girl?

22:24.301 --> 22:25.468
You did not tell me that!

22:25.533 --> 22:27.700
I... A gentleman never tells

22:27.767 --> 22:31.201
when his girl kisses
a girl and a guy.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.767
It does kind of feel
like old times.

22:33.834 --> 22:35.401
SETH:
Good God.

22:55.267 --> 22:56.867
Oh, my God, Coop!

22:56.934 --> 22:58.034
Is it okay?

22:58.101 --> 22:59.633
Okay? It's beautiful.

23:01.434 --> 23:02.867
I can't believe
you did all this.

23:02.934 --> 23:05.234
It reminds me of when
Mr. Freeze attacked

23:05.301 --> 23:08.301
the Gotham Society Ball,
which is a compliment.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.967
Well, I'm just glad
people showed up

23:12.034 --> 23:13.434
and they're actually dancing.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.401
Yeah, wanna...?

23:17.468 --> 23:18.667
Dance?

23:18.734 --> 23:19.867
Sure. Why not?

23:19.934 --> 23:21.267
I'll see you later.

23:24.134 --> 23:25.767
Don't even think about it.

23:35.368 --> 23:38.334
How bad do you wish
DJ were here right now?

23:38.401 --> 23:39.700
It's okay.

23:39.767 --> 23:43.934
Just, if it's not too weird,
don't stand so far away.

23:44.001 --> 23:48.301
It looks like we're
in the fifth grade.

23:48.368 --> 23:49.368
Right.

24:02.201 --> 24:02.900
Jimmy, look!
See?

24:02.967 --> 24:03.867
Hmm? Mm-mm.

24:03.934 --> 24:06.167
JIMMY:
Mmm! Yeah.

24:06.234 --> 24:07.134
She looks beautiful.

24:07.201 --> 24:08.600
Yes, but more importantly,

24:08.667 --> 24:10.368
she's with Ryan, who right now,

24:10.434 --> 24:12.734
let's face it,
looks like Prince Charming.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.667
So you're happy?

24:14.734 --> 24:16.767
Oh, so happy.

24:16.834 --> 24:18.034
Thank you for coming.

24:25.234 --> 24:27.468
Oh, hey.

24:27.533 --> 24:28.468
Hey, hi.

24:31.900 --> 24:32.834
( doorbell rings )

24:32.900 --> 24:34.134
Dad.

24:34.201 --> 24:36.234
Sandy didn't tell me
you were coming over.

24:36.301 --> 24:39.368
He said he had something
that could save my hide.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.700
Clearly, he didn't
share it with you.

24:41.767 --> 24:43.434
No, he actually respects things

24:43.500 --> 24:45.500
like attorney-client
privilege.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.900
Yeah, I said call me,
not come over.

24:47.967 --> 24:49.434
I was in the neighborhood.

24:54.234 --> 24:56.167
So, what've you got?

24:56.234 --> 24:59.633
What is this miraculous
development?

24:59.700 --> 25:01.301
I spoke with
Renee Wheeler today.

25:01.368 --> 25:02.667
I know about the affair.

25:02.734 --> 25:03.767
What?

25:03.834 --> 25:04.800
Relax. She didn't
give you up.

25:04.867 --> 25:05.934
Why didn't you tell me?

25:06.001 --> 25:07.934
Because the details
of my personal life

25:08.001 --> 25:09.500
have no bearing
on this case.

25:09.567 --> 25:10.967
Oh, yes they do.

25:11.034 --> 25:12.800
The D.A. thinks you've been
paying off Renee Wheeler

25:12.867 --> 25:13.800
to get building permits.

25:13.867 --> 25:15.867
The D.A.'s an idiot.

25:15.934 --> 25:20.633
Even if you were having an
affair with this woman...

25:20.700 --> 25:23.468
16 years is an
awfully long time

25:23.533 --> 25:25.700
to be paying
someone palimony.

25:26.867 --> 25:28.468
Unless there was a child.

25:28.533 --> 25:31.700
That is the most preposterous...

25:31.767 --> 25:33.034
Was there a child?

25:37.334 --> 25:38.834
We were together
just a few months.

25:38.900 --> 25:42.800
Renee came to me,
said she was pregnant.

25:42.867 --> 25:44.967
I set up a trust.

25:45.034 --> 25:46.900
It was a long time ago, Sandy.

25:46.967 --> 25:48.800
I made a mistake.

25:48.867 --> 25:53.167
Well, when you make a mistake...
you really make a mistake.

25:57.267 --> 25:58.468
First thing Monday morning,

25:58.533 --> 25:59.967
you and Renee are going
to go the judge

26:00.034 --> 26:01.001
and tell him everything.

26:01.067 --> 26:02.267
I can't do that.

26:02.334 --> 26:04.834
You're both looking
at jail time.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.234
I'm sorry, Sandy, I can't.

26:07.301 --> 26:08.633
( car starting )

26:12.734 --> 26:15.633
Hey, this is KHHS,
the Harbor School Radio Station

26:15.700 --> 26:18.468
coming to you live
from the Sno.C. Winter Dance,

26:18.533 --> 26:21.900
and this is song for all you
lonely hearts out there.

26:36.101 --> 26:37.334
Fine.

26:37.401 --> 26:39.134
But no talking.

26:51.034 --> 26:52.867
Ryan?

26:52.934 --> 26:53.934
Hi.

26:54.001 --> 26:56.434
You look so handsome.

26:56.500 --> 26:57.234
Thanks.

26:57.301 --> 26:58.434
I know that you

26:58.533 --> 27:00.334
and I have had our
differences in the past,

27:00.401 --> 27:02.468
but now with you and
Marissa are back together...

27:02.533 --> 27:03.533
Actually, we're...

27:03.600 --> 27:05.267
You know, with you gone
this summer,

27:05.334 --> 27:07.167
she got a little bit
out of control.

27:07.234 --> 27:09.101
But with the both of us
looking out for her...

27:09.167 --> 27:10.301
Hi, sweetie.

27:10.368 --> 27:13.301
We were just talking
about you.

27:13.368 --> 27:14.201
Well, we don't want
to keep you

27:14.267 --> 27:15.201
from your hosting duties.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.468
Oh, okay.

27:19.434 --> 27:21.700
She told you
you were handsome?

27:21.767 --> 27:23.001
Yeah.

27:23.067 --> 27:24.600
A year ago she wanted
to have me committed

27:24.667 --> 27:26.633
'cause I was dating you.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.900
Now, somehow, you've
managed to find someone

27:28.967 --> 27:30.167
she hates even more.

27:30.234 --> 27:32.267
I know. Can you imagine
what she would have done

27:32.334 --> 27:33.334
if I'd brought DJ?

27:33.401 --> 27:34.633
Kind of.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.934
Which is why
I'm surprised you didn't.

27:37.001 --> 27:38.567
You usually don't pass up
a chance

27:38.633 --> 27:39.600
to ruin your mom's night.

27:39.667 --> 27:41.800
Yeah, but why put DJ
through that?

27:41.867 --> 27:43.201
I already cost
him his job.

27:43.267 --> 27:45.267
So, it's not because
you're embarrassed?

27:45.334 --> 27:47.401
I already told you,

27:47.468 --> 27:52.234
the winter ball, it's...
not his type of thing.

27:52.301 --> 27:54.101
Did he decide that or did you?

28:13.834 --> 28:15.734
I figure
we're probably the same size.

28:17.767 --> 28:18.867
Thanks.

28:20.567 --> 28:22.067
Oh, hey.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.700
You sure you're
going to be okay?

28:24.767 --> 28:28.967
Yeah. Actually, there's
something I have to do.

28:51.934 --> 28:52.900
Can I talk yet?

28:52.967 --> 28:54.034
( groans )

28:54.101 --> 28:57.667
I just was curious,
why Zach isn't here.

28:57.734 --> 29:01.567
Because... he was
jealous, I guess.

29:01.633 --> 29:03.134
He was jealous?

29:03.201 --> 29:04.134
Of what?

29:04.201 --> 29:06.767
Of, uh, my good looks
and charm?

29:06.834 --> 29:07.934
Of my modesty?

29:08.001 --> 29:09.500
Of your big mouth.

29:09.567 --> 29:10.834
He saw us talking.

29:10.900 --> 29:11.967
When?

29:12.034 --> 29:14.468
In the hallway,
in the lounge.

29:14.533 --> 29:15.600
Yeah...

29:15.667 --> 29:17.567
Before, during
and after school.

29:17.633 --> 29:18.633
( sighing )

29:24.934 --> 29:26.301
I mean, we were
just talking.

29:26.368 --> 29:26.934
Yeah.

29:27.001 --> 29:27.967
Hey, guys.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.700
Zach, you came!

29:31.767 --> 29:34.167
Yeah. I thought you might
still need a date.

29:35.034 --> 29:36.334
Stupid, huh?

29:36.401 --> 29:37.468
Zach, it's really
not like that.

29:37.533 --> 29:39.067
Yeah, it is.

29:39.134 --> 29:40.267
I-I get it.

29:40.334 --> 29:41.867
You guys are just one
of those couples--

29:41.934 --> 29:42.900
even when you're not
being a couple,

29:42.967 --> 29:43.967
you'll always be a couple.

29:44.034 --> 29:46.167
You're Joanie
and Chachie.

29:46.234 --> 29:47.267
Luke and Leia.

29:47.334 --> 29:49.468
Luke and Leia were
brother and sister.

29:49.533 --> 29:51.834
Yeah, well, may the force
be with you.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.067
Hi.

30:08.134 --> 30:11.434
So... I was just in
the neighborhood.

30:11.500 --> 30:12.667
Um...

30:13.800 --> 30:16.234
Oh, uh...

30:16.301 --> 30:17.434
it-it's Freud.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.468
I have slippers
with Freud on them.

30:20.533 --> 30:23.301
They're my
Freudian slippers.

30:23.368 --> 30:24.434
Okay.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.434
Uh, so what are
you doing here?

30:26.500 --> 30:29.633
I just wanted to tell you...

30:29.700 --> 30:32.567
that I should have gone
to the dance with you.

30:32.633 --> 30:35.001
I wanted...
to go... with you.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.967
That's why you're here?

30:37.034 --> 30:39.067
And I was hoping
we could, you know,

30:39.134 --> 30:40.500
do something, hang out.

30:40.567 --> 30:41.900
Um...

30:45.500 --> 30:46.600
No.

30:46.667 --> 30:48.834
I'm sorry.

30:48.900 --> 30:50.334
Okay. What about tomorrow night?

30:50.401 --> 30:52.667
Ryan, this isn't
going to work.

30:52.734 --> 30:54.767
Why not?

30:54.834 --> 30:57.368
Because, you're...
you're you.

30:57.434 --> 30:58.633
Wh-What does that mean?

30:58.700 --> 31:03.034
I mean, you're this tough kid
from Chino

31:03.101 --> 31:08.067
who lives in some
rich family's pool house,

31:08.134 --> 31:09.533
with an ex-girlfriend

31:09.600 --> 31:12.934
who's maybe the most
intimidatingly beautiful girl

31:13.001 --> 31:14.034
in the history of high school.

31:14.101 --> 31:17.067
Yeah, but right now
I'm here with you.

31:17.134 --> 31:18.401
I mean, I will see you
at school,

31:18.468 --> 31:22.334
in the hallway, in class
and...

31:22.401 --> 31:23.567
I'm not giving up...

31:25.134 --> 31:28.567
'cause I like you.

31:28.633 --> 31:31.167
Who knows why.

31:31.234 --> 31:33.967
I think that if you got to
know me, you'd like me, too.

31:34.034 --> 31:37.633
So, good night.

32:12.930 --> 32:13.964
Hello, Renee.

32:14.032 --> 32:17.171
Thank you for agreeing
to meet me here.

32:17.238 --> 32:20.076
What's this
all about, Caleb?

32:20.143 --> 32:22.815
I understand you had
a run-in with my son-in-law.

32:22.881 --> 32:25.119
He came to see me, but
I didn't say anything.

32:25.187 --> 32:27.390
I know and I appreciate that.

32:27.456 --> 32:28.926
This must be tough on you.

32:28.993 --> 32:31.198
We just have to get through
the next couple of weeks.

32:31.264 --> 32:32.699
And then what?

32:32.767 --> 32:34.938
Then you go to jail?

32:35.004 --> 32:37.541
Are you really willing to do
that to protect the secret?

32:37.609 --> 32:39.545
It's not the secret
I'm trying to protect,

32:39.613 --> 32:41.683
it's my family.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.220
This would devastate
my daughter.

32:43.287 --> 32:45.424
And what about mine?

32:45.490 --> 32:46.726
Ours.

32:48.898 --> 32:50.868
I could arrange for you both
to leave the country.

32:50.935 --> 32:52.370
( scoffs )

32:52.438 --> 32:54.609
Not permanently,
just until this blows over.

32:58.482 --> 32:59.383
What are you going to do?

33:02.724 --> 33:04.995
I don't know anymore.

33:25.668 --> 33:27.103
Pretty quiet
around here, huh?

33:27.171 --> 33:30.543
Yeah, all the kiddies are
at their various winter dances.

33:30.610 --> 33:33.249
Yoo-Hoo please. One.

33:38.192 --> 33:40.095
You were at the Killer
show here, right?

33:40.162 --> 33:44.536
Uh, I go to a lot of
shows here, as I work here.

33:44.603 --> 33:46.473
No, yeah, you were
here with Ryan.

33:46.541 --> 33:49.246
Um, yeah, at the time.

33:49.313 --> 33:51.417
Why, you go to Harbor?

33:51.483 --> 33:53.320
Why aren't you at
the Sno.C. Winter Wake-Off?

33:53.388 --> 33:56.927
It's complicated.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.896
Or not.

33:58.964 --> 34:00.834
The girl I like is in love
with another guy

34:00.901 --> 34:02.237
and probably always will be.

34:02.305 --> 34:04.308
And right now,
your girl is at the dance

34:04.375 --> 34:05.409
with the other guy?

34:05.478 --> 34:07.013
And you're here.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.683
Well, if she didn't
love you before,

34:08.750 --> 34:10.585
then this display
of courage and dedication

34:10.652 --> 34:12.822
should definitely do the trick.

34:12.891 --> 34:15.829
I'm sensing a low level
of sarcasm here.

34:18.101 --> 34:19.036
What am I supposed to do?

34:19.101 --> 34:21.340
Be a man.

34:21.408 --> 34:23.844
Put down your chocolate soda
and fight for her.

34:23.911 --> 34:25.415
I'm not really much
of a fighter.

34:25.482 --> 34:27.685
I know I look big, but it's
just, I have broad shoulders.

34:27.752 --> 34:30.190
No, what I mean
is that she can't fall for you

34:30.257 --> 34:32.094
if you're not there
to catch her.

34:37.071 --> 34:38.373
You're right.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.609
At least threaten
to fight for her.

34:40.677 --> 34:42.246
And even if it turned
into an actual fight,

34:42.313 --> 34:43.282
I could take Seth Cohen.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.254
Thanks.

34:47.857 --> 34:50.261
Did he just say
Seth Cohen?

34:57.843 --> 34:59.212
That's our gardener.

34:59.279 --> 35:00.415
Oh, my God.

35:03.888 --> 35:05.257
Oh, no, you don't.
Jimmy!

35:05.324 --> 35:07.127
No, come on.
Let go.

35:07.194 --> 35:08.729
You're coming with me.
Jimmy, I have to...

35:08.797 --> 35:10.733
What, embarrass Marissa?

35:10.801 --> 35:11.936
Don't you remember
when we were kids?

35:12.003 --> 35:13.205
No one could keep us apart.

35:13.273 --> 35:15.143
First of all, it is
not the same thing.

35:15.209 --> 35:17.313
Second of all, am I the
gardener in this scenario?

35:17.380 --> 35:18.381
I think not.

35:18.449 --> 35:19.750
My parents threatened
to cut me off

35:19.818 --> 35:20.920
if I didn't
break up with you.

35:20.987 --> 35:23.825
You never told me that.

35:23.893 --> 35:25.862
I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

35:25.930 --> 35:27.266
What did you tell them?

35:27.332 --> 35:28.333
I told them to go to hell.

35:28.401 --> 35:29.903
I told them
I was in love with you.

35:29.970 --> 35:31.840
I was.

35:31.908 --> 35:35.681
Well, I was easy
to love back then.

35:35.748 --> 35:39.388
I was beautiful
and much nicer.

35:39.455 --> 35:43.329
Jules, come on,
you're still beautiful.

35:43.397 --> 35:46.035
And we both know
you were never nice.

36:18.564 --> 36:21.034
We said that we were going
to stay away from each other.

36:21.102 --> 36:25.276
Yeah, except Ryan left
with the car.

36:25.343 --> 36:27.581
Well, I have to wait
for DJ and Marissa

36:27.648 --> 36:29.784
to finish making out, so...

36:29.851 --> 36:31.220
Oh.

36:49.088 --> 36:51.292
So it looks like we've done
really well for ourselves.

36:51.359 --> 36:52.393
Oh, yeah, very impressive.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.164
Yeah, nice going.
Right back at ya.

36:56.869 --> 36:58.072
Zach!

37:00.343 --> 37:01.210
Hey, man, you came back.

37:01.278 --> 37:02.480
Listen, now...

37:03.515 --> 37:05.285
Oh, my God!

37:05.353 --> 37:06.988
Oh, my God.

37:07.055 --> 37:08.524
Oh, my goodness.

37:08.592 --> 37:09.593
You hit him?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.162
I know... I don't know
what happened.

37:11.230 --> 37:12.299
I never hit
anybody before.

37:12.366 --> 37:13.634
You'd never know it.

37:13.702 --> 37:15.638
I'm, I'm so sorry.

37:15.705 --> 37:17.775
I probably deserved it.

37:17.843 --> 37:18.876
Seth?

37:20.047 --> 37:21.583
Alex?
Alex?

37:22.619 --> 37:23.954
Alex.

37:24.020 --> 37:26.325
What are you doing here?
I felt responsible for you.

37:29.532 --> 37:30.900
I can take it from here.

37:34.641 --> 37:37.546
Yeah, I, uh... I guess you can.

37:37.614 --> 37:39.015
Come on, Zach.
See you guys.

37:39.083 --> 37:40.152
Sorry, Cohen.

37:44.393 --> 37:45.662
Come on.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.433
We have a first aid kit
back at the club.

37:49.135 --> 37:50.704
The storeroom, perhaps?

37:50.772 --> 37:52.274
Do you want to get hit again?

37:55.514 --> 37:56.449
( sighs )

37:56.516 --> 37:57.752
Here.

37:57.820 --> 37:58.922
Thanks.

38:02.227 --> 38:04.965
Look, I'm really sorry.

38:05.032 --> 38:07.636
It's just every time I turn
around, it's you and Cohen.

38:07.704 --> 38:09.908
I know.

38:09.975 --> 38:11.177
I'm sorry.

38:11.244 --> 38:13.247
But he's not my boyfriend.

38:13.315 --> 38:15.586
He's not.
He's just...

38:15.652 --> 38:17.422
He's Cohen.

38:17.490 --> 38:19.627
So what am I?

38:19.694 --> 38:23.199
Well, you were my boyfriend.

38:23.267 --> 38:26.305
Until you decided
not to take me to the dance.

38:26.373 --> 38:29.546
So, can I ask you a question?

38:31.249 --> 38:33.118
Will you go
to the dance with me?

38:33.186 --> 38:37.193
Hmm... let me think about it.

38:45.074 --> 38:47.044
( sighing )

38:47.112 --> 38:48.481
You sure you're okay?

38:48.549 --> 38:49.884
I'm fine.

38:49.952 --> 38:52.790
It's just a shame you
got there when you did,

38:52.857 --> 38:55.862
'cause I was about ready
to, you know, bring the hurt.

38:55.930 --> 38:57.498
( laughs ):
Really.

38:57.566 --> 38:59.268
Yeah, yeah, you bet.

38:59.336 --> 39:00.772
I'd like to see that.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.041
Yeah?

39:02.107 --> 39:03.376
A little bit of...
a little bit of that?

39:03.443 --> 39:04.812
Oh, no.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.482
What are those?

39:06.549 --> 39:08.352
These? These
are fists, okay?

39:08.420 --> 39:12.427
Or, as I like to call them,
the twin ambassadors of pain.

39:12.494 --> 39:13.863
Come here.
Stand up.

39:13.930 --> 39:15.398
You're touching
the twin ambassadors.

39:15.466 --> 39:17.570
Hold them like...

39:17.637 --> 39:19.406
like this.

39:19.474 --> 39:21.277
Okay. What are you doing?

39:21.344 --> 39:22.613
I'm teaching you
to defend yourself.

39:22.680 --> 39:23.648
What, against who? You?

39:23.716 --> 39:24.851
Quite possibly.

39:24.918 --> 39:26.152
This is really fun,
thanks.

39:26.220 --> 39:27.623
All right, all right. Okay.

39:27.689 --> 39:29.525
Defend yourself.
I don't know how.

39:29.593 --> 39:31.697
Ow!

39:31.764 --> 39:33.000
I'm sorry.

39:33.067 --> 39:35.136
My eye, I think you just
scratched my cornea.

39:35.204 --> 39:36.439
I can't see.
No! No way, no.

39:36.506 --> 39:38.275
It's blurry. Put your
hands down. Let me see.

39:38.343 --> 39:39.779
It's blurry.

39:39.847 --> 39:41.082
What are you talking about?
It's fine.

39:41.148 --> 39:42.217
Then why does it hurt?

39:42.283 --> 39:45.389
Um...

39:48.029 --> 39:49.497
There.

39:49.564 --> 39:50.800
Is that better?

39:50.868 --> 39:54.306
A little.
A little bit.

39:56.111 --> 39:57.781
Did I get you anywhere else?

39:57.847 --> 40:00.719
You kind of nicked me
right there a little bit,

40:00.786 --> 40:01.888
I think.

40:03.424 --> 40:05.094
Yeah, I don't know.
It hurts.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.499
( knock at door)

40:25.567 --> 40:27.036
Come in.

40:32.446 --> 40:34.751
Um...

40:34.817 --> 40:37.455
After you left, I tried to read

40:37.522 --> 40:38.858
and I do this thing

40:38.925 --> 40:40.795
where I put a red dot
at the bottom of the page

40:40.863 --> 40:42.665
to see how efficiently
I'm reading.

40:42.732 --> 40:45.269
And sometimes I have to read
a page two or three times,

40:45.337 --> 40:47.508
so there will be
two or three red dots.

40:47.574 --> 40:50.881
Um, well, after you left,

40:50.948 --> 40:56.124
I made 11 red dots
at the bottom of the page.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.595
Eleven.
Lindsay...

40:58.663 --> 41:01.301
I'm talking too much,
as usual.

41:01.368 --> 41:02.804
I'm sorry.

41:02.871 --> 41:05.543
I just, I get nervous and
I start talking and then...

41:05.609 --> 41:07.780
nothing can shut me up.

41:15.595 --> 41:18.301
Except that, I guess.

41:20.137 --> 41:21.471
I know something we can do

41:21.539 --> 41:24.144
that doesn't involve
a lot of talking.

41:24.212 --> 41:25.280
All right, throw it again.

41:25.346 --> 41:26.582
Throw it! Throw it! Wait, wait.

41:27.718 --> 41:30.089
Wait, what happened
to my head?

41:30.156 --> 41:32.125
It rolled under the truck.

41:32.193 --> 41:32.927
( laughing ):
What?

41:32.995 --> 41:34.396
It's not good.

41:36.802 --> 41:39.440
So this is
hanging out, huh?

41:39.506 --> 41:40.909
Yeah.

41:43.381 --> 41:44.783
( doorbell rings )

41:46.621 --> 41:47.890
Ms. Wheeler!

41:47.956 --> 41:49.359
Sorry to come by so late.

41:49.425 --> 41:51.428
Sandy?

41:51.496 --> 41:54.802
Is everything okay?

41:54.869 --> 41:55.938
I'm Kirsten Cohen.

41:56.006 --> 41:58.509
Renee Wheeler. Hi.

42:00.180 --> 42:02.584
Renee is a witness
in your father's case.

42:02.651 --> 42:04.220
Let's go out back
where we can talk.

42:06.025 --> 42:07.559
We won't be long.

42:14.774 --> 42:16.777
I shouldn't be talking to
you. If anyone finds out...

42:16.844 --> 42:17.645
They won't.

42:17.713 --> 42:19.082
You have my word.

42:20.786 --> 42:23.557
I just need to know
what has Caleb told you.

42:23.624 --> 42:27.164
I know everything.

42:27.231 --> 42:28.834
Without any help from Caleb.

42:28.901 --> 42:30.770
Which is why I need you.

42:30.838 --> 42:32.507
If you were to come forward
to the judge

42:32.574 --> 42:33.643
with the right documentation,

42:33.710 --> 42:35.245
the D.A. would drop
the charges,

42:35.313 --> 42:36.916
case would go away.

42:36.984 --> 42:39.922
( laughter )

42:41.392 --> 42:42.660
Mom!

42:43.796 --> 42:45.632
What are you doing here?
