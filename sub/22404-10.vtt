10:18.492 --> 10:20.870
- Wa--wait, Captain Man!
Wh--what are you doing?!?

10:20.953 --> 10:22.121
- Stopping a jewel thief

10:22.204 --> 10:23.372
before she strikes again.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.123
- Wh--dude!
She's not a jewel thief!

10:24.206 --> 10:26.375
- Yes I am.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.002
- I mean, geez man,
you don't just

10:28.085 --> 10:29.170
shoot a miniature corn dog
out of a girl's hand!

10:29.253 --> 10:31.630
- You do if she's
a nasty jewel thief!

10:31.714 --> 10:33.007
Which she is!
- No she's not!

10:33.090 --> 10:35.384
- Yes I am.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.385
- No, you're n--
I'm sorry.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.929
Wh-wh-wha--

10:42.099 --> 10:43.351

master jewel thief.

10:43.434 --> 10:46.062
How ya doin'?

10:46.145 --> 10:48.856
- But you're so pretty!

10:48.939 --> 10:51.484
- Forget her, Kid.
She's rotten fruit.

10:51.567 --> 10:52.860
- What?

10:52.943 --> 10:54.403
- Quiet!

10:54.487 --> 10:55.488
Now I'm takin' you back to jail.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.573
- Uh, no you're not.

10:57.656 --> 10:59.533
- Ow!

10:59.617 --> 11:01.035
What's that
supposed to mean?!?

11:01.118 --> 11:03.079
- I got outta jail
six weeks ago.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.914
And now I am a free citizen.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.290
And look...

11:06.374 --> 11:07.291
here's my ticket
for this museum,

11:07.375 --> 11:09.293
which means I have
as much right

11:09.377 --> 11:12.421
to walk around here
as anyone.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.965
- Valid ticket dude.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.261
- Well, you can't have any
more of my Captain Corn Dogs,

11:19.345 --> 11:20.596
I can tell ya that.

11:20.679 --> 11:23.432
- Cool with me.
I don't care if I ca...

11:23.516 --> 11:25.851
- Oh re--,
oh what's wrong?

11:25.935 --> 11:26.936
- Oh, uh...
- Are you?

11:27.019 --> 11:27.436
- What's going on?

11:27.520 --> 11:30.314
- Oooooooh!!

11:30.398 --> 11:31.315
- I saw that.
- Y'see that, Kid?

11:31.399 --> 11:32.316
You see what
kinda jerk she is?!?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.943
- Y'know what?

11:34.026 --> 11:36.570
I can't believe you're
a jewel thief?!?

11:36.654 --> 11:37.279
You told me you were
an Olympic gymnast!

11:37.363 --> 11:40.116
- Yeah--I lied.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.327
- Ohhhh!.
Lyin' too huh?

11:43.953 --> 11:44.995
Whatever Heather.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.831
You wanna walk
around this museum? Fine.

11:46.914 --> 11:49.542
You wanna look at some
stools and-or jewels?

11:49.625 --> 11:51.502
Go for it.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.629
But don't even THINK
about tryin' to steal

11:53.712 --> 11:54.672
the Neal Diamond.

11:54.755 --> 11:55.631
- I won't.

11:55.714 --> 11:58.008
- Good.
- Goooood.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.135
- I'm just gonna do it.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.970
- Fine.
- Whatever.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.555
- Wait...
- Whaaaaaat?

12:02.638 --> 12:04.473
- I'm gonna steal
the Neal Diamond

12:04.557 --> 12:05.683
before the museum
closes tonight.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.101
And there's not one thing

12:07.184 --> 12:10.146
either of you can do to stop me.

12:18.487 --> 12:21.282
- I really wanted her
to be a gymnast.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.162
[ music ]

12:32.001 --> 12:33.752
- Yo yo!
- Ha ha ha!

12:40.384 --> 12:42.511
- Look at her.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.597
- Yeah, she makes me so...

12:44.680 --> 12:47.683
Awww, look at this guy

12:47.766 --> 12:49.185
He's probably gonna try
to flirt with her, like I did.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.479
- Pfftt. Watch--
bet she's gonna tell him

12:51.562 --> 12:54.148
she's a gymnast, too.
- Yeah.

12:54.231 --> 12:57.985
Hey, hey yo dude!
My man!

12:58.068 --> 13:00.779
Not a gymnast. So...

13:03.449 --> 13:04.325
- I might enter
my Captain Corn Dog recipe

13:04.408 --> 13:07.203
in a contest.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.913
- Oh, yeah,
yeah yeah.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.748
- Y'know, like a, like--
an appetizer recipe contest

13:10.831 --> 13:13.918
where the winner
can win like a boat

13:14.001 --> 13:15.377
or something cool.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.463
- Okay, hang on a second--
I can't take this.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.886
- Hey.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.764
I might enter
my Captain Corn Dog recipe

13:26.847 --> 13:28.557
in a contest.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.476
- So later, you maybe
wanna go grab some coffee,

13:30.559 --> 13:32.686
get some avocado toast?

13:32.770 --> 13:34.522
- Maybe, yeah,
that sounds pretty cool.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.358
- Hey!
- Hey sorry.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.235
Uh, just dude-to-dude...

13:39.318 --> 13:41.779
just to let ya know that uh...
this girl's a thief.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.822
Yeah, and an ex-con.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.200
She's been in-and-outta jail
like six times.

13:46.283 --> 13:50.246
So...
She's bad news.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.624
- So, do you wanna
get some avocado toast?

13:53.707 --> 13:54.625
- Uh, yeah, I would,
but first...

13:54.708 --> 13:57.670
I gotta steal
the Neal Diamond.

13:57.753 --> 14:01.882
- Ooooo!

14:01.966 --> 14:03.551
Okay.

14:03.634 --> 14:07.137
- Well, I guess you'll be
paying for avocado toast then.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.139
- I guess so.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.518
- Why would a person
toast an avocado?

14:12.601 --> 14:14.770
- Nooooo.
- Nah nah nah nah.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.397
- You toast bread,
and then spread avocado

14:16.480 --> 14:18.607
on the bread.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.943
- Ulch.
You Americans are animals!

14:26.532 --> 14:27.908
- Slow cooker...
- Hey.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.786
- Maybe uh, scuba gear...

14:30.869 --> 14:32.454
an archery set...

14:32.538 --> 14:34.957
- Ma'am, please walk away.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.250
- Hey what's your deal?

14:36.333 --> 14:37.626
- That thief Heather,
keeps sayin'

14:37.710 --> 14:38.669
that she's gonna
steal the diamond!

14:38.752 --> 14:41.297
- Oh yeah, well
good luck to her.

14:41.380 --> 14:46.635
'Cuz I'm not takin'
my eyes off this baby.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.179
- Hey, can I have
a Captain Corn Dog?

14:49.263 --> 14:51.223
- Well, you sure
can buddy!

14:51.307 --> 14:53.934
In fact, I'm thinkin'
about entering the recipe

14:54.018 --> 14:55.769
in a contest...

14:55.853 --> 14:58.314
- Yeah, I like to make them
wiggle like this.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.316
See that?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.192
- There they are!

15:02.276 --> 15:03.777
Hi Captain Man
and Kid Danger!

15:03.861 --> 15:07.197
- Well hello there.
- Ah, hello...hi.

15:07.281 --> 15:07.781

15:07.865 --> 15:11.452
- Uh, miss...?

15:11.535 --> 15:12.953
- She uh...

15:13.037 --> 15:14.663
about my Captain Corn Dogs.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.165
- You guys heard
about the corn dogs?

15:16.248 --> 15:17.499
- No.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.500
We're here to watch
Heather Bogart

15:18.584 --> 15:21.253

the Neal Diamond!

15:21.337 --> 15:22.880
- Wait.
- Wait a minute...

15:22.963 --> 15:24.048
- How do you know she's
gonna try and steal it?

15:24.131 --> 15:24.590
- She posted a video about it!

15:24.673 --> 15:28.552
Here look...

15:28.636 --> 15:30.971
- Wassup?

15:31.055 --> 15:34.767
I'm gonna steal
the Neal Diamond.

15:36.685 --> 15:39.855
- Well, that was to the point.

15:39.938 --> 15:41.940
- Hey hey look at that.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.026

15:44.109 --> 15:46.111
- Yeah, the screen.

15:46.195 --> 15:46.654
- Why, what you see?

15:46.737 --> 15:49.239
- Heather...

15:49.323 --> 15:52.242
She's whispering
to those photographers.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.162
- Hey, you guys wanna
go take some us-fies

15:55.245 --> 15:55.871
in the gift shop?

15:55.954 --> 15:59.583
'Kay, walk with me.

16:07.883 --> 16:08.967
- Hey guys, can we

16:13.681 --> 16:14.723

- I don't see why not.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.558
Lemme just adjust
my hair real quick.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.060
Let's get the Captain
Corn Dogs in there.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.061
They're the real heroes here.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.938
- And one...

16:28.654 --> 16:31.198

I can't see!

16:31.281 --> 16:32.491
- Neither can I!!!

16:32.574 --> 16:35.494
- I-I think that was
hyper gamma light!!!

16:35.577 --> 16:37.246
- What is hyper gamma light?!?

16:37.329 --> 16:39.832
- It's a new technology!

16:39.915 --> 16:41.750
It's as bright as
the three suns of Jupiter!

16:41.834 --> 16:44.795
It makes it so that you
temporarily cannot see!

16:44.878 --> 16:45.921
- Whoa!

16:46.004 --> 16:46.588
- And it even works
on Captain Man?!?

16:46.672 --> 16:49.299
- Yah yah, look at--

16:49.383 --> 16:50.050
you're watching
the same show I am!

16:53.470 --> 16:55.597
- What happened?!?
- Oh, see...

16:55.681 --> 16:56.849
those photographers
just blasted you

16:56.932 --> 16:59.601
and everyone in this room
with hyper gamma light,

16:59.685 --> 17:01.270
which means you won't
be seeing anything

17:01.353 --> 17:03.188
for the next two hours.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.482
- See? Nailed it.
- Shhh.

17:07.608 --> 17:09.944
- Oh yeah, Heather?!?

17:10.028 --> 17:11.446
Well, Kid Danger and I
might not be able to see,

17:11.530 --> 17:13.490
but we can still PUNCH!

17:16.617 --> 17:17.661
Hey hey Kid,
I think I hit Heather!

17:17.744 --> 17:20.914
Or uhh--maybe
one of her photographers!

17:20.998 --> 17:24.960
Kid! Kid?!?
Hey, hey hey hey.

17:25.042 --> 17:27.921
- You hit me.
- Oh.

17:28.964 --> 17:29.757
Attention!

17:29.840 --> 17:32.968
Attention from Captain Man.

17:33.051 --> 17:34.178
I cannot see!

17:34.261 --> 17:35.345
- We cannot see!

17:35.429 --> 17:37.973
- So, if you
are not a criminal,

17:38.057 --> 17:41.435
please stand back
while Kid Danger and I

17:41.518 --> 17:43.479
locate the perpetrators
and then--

17:49.693 --> 17:50.778
- Oh my god,
what's happening?!?

17:50.861 --> 17:53.572
- Captain Man and Kid Danger
can't see!

17:53.655 --> 17:55.449
- And Heather's trying
to steal the diamond!

17:57.785 --> 17:59.703
- Oh my god, Captain Man!
To your left!

18:02.247 --> 18:03.582
- Woo, way to go Piper!

- Uppercut, uppercut!

18:34.905 --> 18:36.698
- Guys, we can't
all talk at once.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.036
- Kid, where's Heather?!?

18:41.119 --> 18:42.329
- How would I have
