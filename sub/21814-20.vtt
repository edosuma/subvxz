Whoa!
Ah!

17:33.093 --> 17:37.514
- Aw, no bunnies,
just mummies.

17:37.598 --> 17:38.766
- We can't stop now.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.268
{\an3}We've got to find
those bunnies.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.853
- This is all my fault.

17:42.936 --> 17:46.106
I just wanted the ultimate
in ultra-cuteness.

17:46.190 --> 17:50.486
Where are you,
my little fuzzy bumpkins?

18:00.954 --> 18:04.541
{\an1}- There's babies
on the beach.

18:07.544 --> 18:09.129
- Ah!

18:09.213 --> 18:12.132
- Bunny radar says
we're close to the bunnies.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.175
- Down there.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.218
Bunny paw prints.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.348
- Whoa-ah-ah, ouch.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.265
- Ugh.
- Ow.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.560
- Not cute.
- I'm hurt.

18:23.644 --> 18:27.022
- Shout-sitting.
- Oh, brother.

18:27.105 --> 18:30.943
{\an1}- Bunny paw prints
seem to stop right here.

18:31.026 --> 18:31.819
- [gasps]

18:31.902 --> 18:32.694
{\an1}Does anybody else
hear that?

18:32.778 --> 18:33.862
- Hear what, Twist?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.864
- [babbles indistinctly]

18:35.948 --> 18:39.868
{\an1}- Ha, my Bananaphone
will help.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.664
Aha!
Just as I thought.

18:43.747 --> 18:44.456
- What is it?

18:44.540 --> 18:46.834
- A little help, Bo Monkey?

18:49.127 --> 18:52.339
- Ta-da!
- My Cuterer Tuner!

18:52.422 --> 18:53.090
You found it!

18:53.173 --> 18:54.383
[dance music plays, stops]

18:54.466 --> 18:57.886
- The bunnies buried it
in the sand to hide it.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.639
{\an1}- They were a little jealous
of the cute babies.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.140
That's so cute.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.892
I heart bunnies.

[gasps]

19:06.895 --> 19:10.566
My fuzzy bumpkins!

Oh, my cutie-wutie
fuzzy bumpkins.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.403
I missed you.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.612
Sorry I hurt your feelings.

19:15.696 --> 19:19.825
You're the sweetest
super cute bunnies ever.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.411
- Little Squee Z. D.,
we found your bunnies.

19:22.494 --> 19:26.248
You promised you'd help
turn all the babies back.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.249
- Oh, all right.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.918
To make all the babies
big again,

19:30.002 --> 19:33.422
you need to play the
Cuterer Tuner tune different.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.382
- Play the tune different?

19:35.465 --> 19:37.843
Well, that means...remix!
