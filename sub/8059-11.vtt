WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.335
Hey. Hey, guys, listen.

00:03.370 --> 00:04.837
Leslie's gonna
walk in and say something

00:04.871 --> 00:07.152
that sounds very boring but
is actually a really big deal.

00:07.222 --> 00:09.390
So when I give the signal,
just everybody cheer like crazy.

00:09.424 --> 00:10.558
Here we go.

00:10.592 --> 00:12.893
Well, someone just
officially enrolled

00:12.928 --> 00:15.496
in the Senior Executive Service
Development Candidate Program

00:15.530 --> 00:17.331
at the Department
of the Interior.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.732
[all cheering]

00:18.767 --> 00:20.034
Surprise!

00:20.068 --> 00:21.335
Thanks.
It's a big deal.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.471
So my promotion is official.

00:23.505 --> 00:24.905
We need to find
a place in D.C.

00:24.940 --> 00:26.307
because we're gonna be
splitting our time.

00:26.341 --> 00:27.975
I guess now is
as good a time as any

00:28.009 --> 00:29.510
make my announcement.

00:29.544 --> 00:31.846
Joe and I just closed
on a house in Seattle.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.180
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

00:33.215 --> 00:34.515
Cheers.

00:34.549 --> 00:36.851
Well, actually
I have an announcement too.

00:36.885 --> 00:38.786
After all these years
in government,

00:38.820 --> 00:41.255
I've decided to finally retire.

00:41.289 --> 00:42.890
This is about people
who are moving, Garry.

00:42.924 --> 00:44.558
- Not everything is about you.
- Good point.

00:44.593 --> 00:45.793
Everyone's scattering.

00:45.827 --> 00:47.428
Well, look at it this way,

00:47.462 --> 00:49.263
bad news comes in threes, right?

00:49.297 --> 00:50.898
We're leaving,
April and Andy are leaving,

00:50.932 --> 00:52.533
Donna's leaving, that's three.

00:52.567 --> 00:53.834
Also I'm retiring.

00:53.869 --> 00:55.469
That's three, Garry.

00:55.504 --> 00:57.571
But we're probably due
for some good news.

00:57.606 --> 00:58.773
Good evening.

00:58.807 --> 01:00.341
I come to you tonight
with some good news...

01:00.375 --> 01:01.709
Hey.

01:01.743 --> 01:04.044
Is not a sentence I will be
saying to you right now,

01:04.078 --> 01:07.982
because beloved Pawnee Mayor
Walter Gunderson has died.

01:08.016 --> 01:10.951
[all gasp]
[sighs]

01:10.986 --> 01:13.788
Well, you jinxed us, Garry.
Thanks a lot.

01:13.822 --> 01:16.724
[triumphant music]

01:33.642 --> 01:37.645
Walter Gunderson
served Pawnee for 39 years.

01:37.679 --> 01:39.613
And as per his final wish,

01:39.648 --> 01:41.682
his body will lie in state

01:41.716 --> 01:44.351
in the city council chambers
for a day,

01:44.353 --> 01:48.055
which is just a real cool thing
for a public space.

01:48.089 --> 01:50.357
Also, he sent us
a brief video message

01:50.392 --> 01:52.927
to be played for this event.

01:52.961 --> 01:55.496
Hello, Pawnee.

01:55.530 --> 01:59.033
My time in office
has come to an end.

01:59.067 --> 02:01.135
A lot has been done.

02:01.169 --> 02:03.804
But I wasn't really
doing very much.

02:03.839 --> 02:06.240
I wasn't paying attention
most of the time.

02:06.274 --> 02:08.842
Fortunately,
the citizens of Pawnee

02:08.877 --> 02:10.777
didn't pay attention either.

02:10.812 --> 02:13.981
So if there's credit to take,

02:14.015 --> 02:15.749
I will humbly take it.

02:15.784 --> 02:19.720
And if there is blame...

02:19.754 --> 02:21.355
it's your fault.

02:21.389 --> 02:23.224
Thank you.

02:23.258 --> 02:25.092
Good-bye forever.

02:25.127 --> 02:26.393
Uh, okay.

02:26.428 --> 02:28.362
Well, that was really something.

02:28.396 --> 02:31.365
People are dying,
moving, retiring.

02:31.399 --> 02:33.701
Too many endings.
Not enough beginnings.

02:33.735 --> 02:37.138
We need something to begin,
and I have just the thing--

02:37.172 --> 02:40.241
an underground
dance competition.

02:40.275 --> 02:42.276
I'm realizing I know nothing
about the logistics

02:42.310 --> 02:44.144
of how to start an underground
dance competition,

02:44.179 --> 02:46.347
but someone here will.

02:46.381 --> 02:48.783
Hey, April, will you
help me out with something?

02:48.817 --> 02:49.817
No.

02:49.851 --> 02:51.218
Apparently as city manager,

02:51.253 --> 02:52.887
I'm in charge of appointing
an interim mayor

02:52.921 --> 02:54.555
until the special election.

02:54.589 --> 02:56.757
So why don't
you just appoint yourself?

02:56.792 --> 02:58.893
You're basically
running the town anyway.

02:58.927 --> 03:01.228
Well, I was a mayor once before.

03:01.263 --> 03:02.696
We all remember how that went.

03:02.731 --> 03:04.498
Oh, yeah, you completely
disgraced yourself

03:04.533 --> 03:06.667
and destroyed an entire town.

03:06.701 --> 03:08.469
Yeah, I said we all remember.

03:08.503 --> 03:10.304
Now, will you help me
find someone?

03:10.338 --> 03:12.139
It can be anyone
over the age of 30

03:12.174 --> 03:14.408
who's a good symbolic face
for the town.

03:14.443 --> 03:16.043
Fine, whatever.
I'll help you, okay?

03:16.078 --> 03:17.912
Thank you.
I told Garry he could help too.

03:17.946 --> 03:19.880
- What?
- Oh, notarizing a new mayor,

03:19.915 --> 03:22.550
that is--well, it's like
the ultimate notary adventure.

03:22.584 --> 03:24.351
Oh, it's big.

03:24.386 --> 03:26.153
Les-legally Blonde!

03:26.188 --> 03:27.822
Got you a little gift
in New York.

03:27.856 --> 03:29.323
You did?

03:29.357 --> 03:30.791
What did you get me?
Ooh-la-la.

03:30.826 --> 03:32.993
Men's Ferragamo loafers?

03:33.028 --> 03:34.528
What am I supposed
to do with these?

03:34.563 --> 03:36.130
Yeah, you're right.
I should probably keep them.

03:36.164 --> 03:38.566
They're a size 6 1/2.
Too small for you anyway.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.000
- How was your trip?
- Amazing.

03:40.035 --> 03:41.235
A lot of great meetings.

03:41.269 --> 03:43.070
Plus, Lucy and I
had the best time.

03:43.105 --> 03:44.405
It's for real, Leslie.

03:44.439 --> 03:46.040
We even went to a jewelry store
and looked at rings.

03:46.074 --> 03:47.441
No!

03:47.476 --> 03:49.810
Shia LaBeouf is one hell of
a jewelry designer, by the way.

03:49.845 --> 03:50.878
Man's really found his calling.

03:50.912 --> 03:52.213
This is perfect.

03:52.247 --> 03:53.514
With everything ending,

03:53.548 --> 03:55.783
you guys are the happy beginning
that we all need.

03:55.817 --> 03:57.818
You should propose to her,
right now, here.

03:57.853 --> 03:59.787
What better place to ask
a woman to marry you

03:59.821 --> 04:01.989
than an old man's
public memorial?

04:02.024 --> 04:03.190
Yeah, I think
I'm probably gonna wait.

04:03.225 --> 04:04.358
Plus, Lucy's not in town.

04:04.392 --> 04:05.559
She's in Philadelphia
visiting friends.

04:05.594 --> 04:06.961
She gets back tomorrow.

04:06.995 --> 04:08.596
Yeah, you'd probably want
her here for that, right?

04:08.630 --> 04:10.030
All right, I'm gonna find April.

04:10.065 --> 04:13.334
I got her a really nice
Burberry necktie.

04:13.368 --> 04:15.703
Gunderson was mayor
my entire life.

04:15.737 --> 04:19.140
Really makes you consider
the "postulence" of time.

04:19.173 --> 04:20.440
Sure.

04:20.475 --> 04:22.041
Death is natural, Andrew.

04:22.077 --> 04:24.812
We're born, we survive
as long as we're useful,

04:24.846 --> 04:26.313
and then we're killed,

04:26.348 --> 04:28.082
either by our body's
natural decay

04:28.116 --> 04:29.583
or by those
younger and stronger.

04:29.618 --> 04:30.985
Speak for yourself.

04:31.019 --> 04:33.053
Before I die, I'm freezing
my head like Ted Williams.

04:33.088 --> 04:34.889
Wait a thousand years,
thaw it out,

04:34.923 --> 04:37.425
slap it on a robot,
keep on balling.

04:37.459 --> 04:38.526
Ron.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.560
Carl.

04:39.594 --> 04:41.162
Donna, Andy, this is Carl.

04:41.196 --> 04:44.765
He owns the deli right next
to my barber Salvatore's shop.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.066
It's terrible, isn't it?

04:46.101 --> 04:49.270
First Salvatore
and now Mayor Gunderson.

04:49.304 --> 04:52.339
What? What happened?
Explain yourself!

04:52.374 --> 04:53.874
Oh, Ron, you didn't hear?

04:53.909 --> 04:55.876
Salvatore passed away yesterday.

04:55.911 --> 04:57.912
- No.
- Jeez.

04:57.946 --> 05:00.848
No, it can't be.

05:00.882 --> 05:04.018
Was he killed
by a younger, stronger barber?

05:04.052 --> 05:05.686
And now here to say a few words

05:05.720 --> 05:09.123
is Mayor Gunderson's
longtime friend and coworker

05:09.157 --> 05:10.458
Ethel Beavers.

05:10.492 --> 05:12.093
This is gonna be so sad.

05:12.127 --> 05:13.627
They worked together
for a long time.

05:13.662 --> 05:15.095
I'll be brief.

05:15.130 --> 05:17.198
Walter Gunderson and his wife

05:17.232 --> 05:18.799
had an open marriage.

05:18.834 --> 05:23.037
It kept him happy.
It kept his wife happy.

05:23.071 --> 05:24.572
Hi, Evelyn.

05:24.606 --> 05:27.208
And it definitely kept me happy.

05:27.242 --> 05:29.543
What is happening?

05:29.578 --> 05:32.680
Because for 46 wonderful years,

05:32.714 --> 05:34.615
he spent night after night

05:34.649 --> 05:39.086
exploring every nook and cranny
of my body.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.588
[crowd groans]

05:40.622 --> 05:42.089
Grow up, you prudes.

05:42.123 --> 05:43.357
We're all adults.

05:43.391 --> 05:45.659
My only regret
is that I never told him

05:45.694 --> 05:47.394
how I really felt.

05:47.429 --> 05:49.096
So I'll say it now.

05:49.131 --> 05:51.465
I loved that man.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.602
And not just because
he was a dynamite lay.

05:54.636 --> 05:56.670
[scattered groans]

05:59.474 --> 06:01.776
Good night, you animal.

06:01.810 --> 06:03.678
Tom, listen to Ethel.

06:03.712 --> 06:05.246
Ugh, no, it's too gross.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.747
No, listen to her message.

06:06.782 --> 06:08.616
You can't wait to tell someone
how you feel,

06:08.650 --> 06:11.285
because if you wait,
before you know it, boom,

06:11.320 --> 06:13.454
46 years later they're gone.

06:13.488 --> 06:14.455
You're right.

06:14.489 --> 06:15.756
We know we want
to be together forever.

06:15.791 --> 06:17.158
- So why wait?
- Exactly.

06:17.192 --> 06:18.492
And I will help you
with the proposal.

06:18.527 --> 06:19.493
What do you want to do?

06:19.528 --> 06:20.561
Off the top of my head,

06:20.595 --> 06:22.630
I guess my ideal proposal
might be

06:22.664 --> 06:24.465
a multiplatform
media experience,

06:24.499 --> 06:26.700
an action movie
with explosive graphics,

06:26.735 --> 06:28.936
fast cars, and a hero
with one mission--

06:28.970 --> 06:30.438
to propose to his lady.

06:30.472 --> 06:31.439
A hero named...

06:31.473 --> 06:33.274
Both:
Tom Haverford.

06:33.308 --> 06:35.843
- Okay!
- Yes!

06:35.877 --> 06:39.513
Oh, um, people grieve
in different ways.

06:41.645 --> 06:44.255
Listen, if you can't train
200 white doves

06:44.375 --> 06:45.942
in the next four hours
to spell out

06:45.977 --> 06:47.377
"Lucy, will you marry me?"

06:47.411 --> 06:49.579
then you have no business
calling yourself a pet store.

06:49.614 --> 06:51.348
Why can't everyone
share our commitment

06:51.382 --> 06:53.216
to the basic concept
of outrageous pageantry?

06:53.251 --> 06:54.951
I don't know, Tom.
I really don't.

06:54.986 --> 06:56.753
Oh, no,
what do you want, Leslie?

06:56.787 --> 06:59.289
Hey, Ian. I need
a gigantic banner that says,

06:59.323 --> 07:00.857
"Congratulations, Lucy and Tom,"

07:00.892 --> 07:01.858
and I need it by tomorrow.

07:01.893 --> 07:02.959
No way.
Impossible.

07:02.994 --> 07:04.327
Over the past 15 years,

07:04.362 --> 07:07.597
I have spent nearly $100,000
at your banner store.

07:07.632 --> 07:08.965
I have ordered banners

07:09.000 --> 07:10.367
for every personal
and professional event

07:10.401 --> 07:11.635
that I've ever organized.

07:11.669 --> 07:13.336
My credit card company
called me about it.

07:13.371 --> 07:14.804
Not to question the charges

07:14.839 --> 07:17.440
but to sincerely ask me
if I was mentally stable.

07:17.475 --> 07:19.576
See that Rolex Submariner
on your wrist, bro?

07:19.610 --> 07:20.844
That's 'cause of Leslie.

07:20.878 --> 07:22.345
You'll have the banner done.

07:23.614 --> 07:26.316
Hey, Bobby,
thanks for coming in.

07:26.350 --> 07:28.485
Good to see you guys.
It's been a while.

07:28.519 --> 07:31.855
How's Leslie?
Is she still, um...uh...

07:31.889 --> 07:33.256
Oh.

07:33.291 --> 07:34.758
What was that thing
we ran for again?

07:34.792 --> 07:36.159
City councilor.

07:36.194 --> 07:37.928
I don't know.
All right, if you say so.

07:37.962 --> 07:40.664
I tell you, it's so hard to
remember boring stuff like that.

07:40.698 --> 07:42.732
Choosing to ignore
what you just said,

07:42.767 --> 07:45.302
we need an interim mayor
just for two months.

07:45.336 --> 07:48.004
And given your family name
and how well-liked you are,

07:48.039 --> 07:49.573
I thought you might
be interested.

07:49.607 --> 07:51.141
- Mayor?
- Yeah.

07:51.175 --> 07:52.776
Man, that'll be fun.

07:52.810 --> 07:54.444
God, I don't think
I can do it, though.

07:54.478 --> 07:56.580
Yeah, 'cause I'm getting ready
to go on a big trip,

07:56.614 --> 07:57.948
to space.

07:57.982 --> 07:59.349
That'll be really fun too.

07:59.383 --> 08:01.618
Everything in life is always
just so fun, right?

08:01.652 --> 08:02.819
It really is.

08:02.854 --> 08:05.222
See, this guy knows what's what.

08:05.256 --> 08:06.690
- Yeah.
- That was--yeah.

08:06.724 --> 08:08.224
Hey, Ben, have you ever
been to space?

08:08.259 --> 08:10.293
You should check it out.
Seriously.

08:10.328 --> 08:11.695
I'm sure the Russian guys
who built the rocket

08:11.729 --> 08:13.230
- would be cool with it.
- Really?

08:13.264 --> 08:15.265
Just one thing,
do you have $600,000?

08:15.299 --> 08:17.367
It's just, that's what
they need for a deposit.

08:17.401 --> 08:19.769
Oh.
Well, no.

08:19.804 --> 08:21.137
I've already been to space.

08:21.172 --> 08:23.473
I was the second person
to walk on the moon.

08:23.507 --> 08:25.609
Buzz Aldrin.
Nice to meet you.

08:25.643 --> 08:26.877
Nice try.

08:26.911 --> 08:30.413
[chuckling]
That's the guy from <i> Toy Story.</i>

08:30.448 --> 08:31.548
[somber music]

08:31.582 --> 08:33.216
We're so sorry, Ron.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.618
You guys were close?

08:34.652 --> 08:37.187
I've seen Salvatore
the first Tuesday of the month

08:37.221 --> 08:39.722
for the past four decades.

08:39.756 --> 08:42.025
Same exact thing every time.

08:42.058 --> 08:44.126
I paid him $8.

08:44.160 --> 08:45.695
I sat in the same chair.

08:45.730 --> 08:47.998
Salvatore put
the same cape over me.

08:48.032 --> 08:50.867
Then he'd always ask me
about the same thing...

08:50.902 --> 08:54.471
nothing.

08:54.505 --> 08:56.172
It was perfect.

08:56.207 --> 08:59.276
Can't delay this forever.
Excuse me.

09:02.146 --> 09:05.015
The three most important people
in a man's life

09:05.049 --> 09:09.920
are his barber, his butcher,
and his lover.

09:11.522 --> 09:13.623
I have lost one of those.

09:14.759 --> 09:17.060
Here's a tenner, Sal.

09:20.565 --> 09:22.032
As you know,
I don't believe in tipping,

09:22.066 --> 09:24.267
so I will collect
my change from your wife.

09:27.438 --> 09:31.408
I had an appointment with
Salvatore scheduled for Tuesday.

09:31.442 --> 09:33.343
Look how raggedy my hair is.

09:33.377 --> 09:35.579
What am I supposed to be,
some kind or rock star?

09:37.415 --> 09:39.449
Okay, Tom, there's your mark.

09:39.483 --> 09:40.917
You'll enter from the front.

09:40.952 --> 09:42.152
Ted, are we rolling?

09:42.186 --> 09:44.287
I think so.
I don't really know.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.056
Just please be careful
with my store.

09:46.090 --> 09:48.258
Okay, quiet on the set!

09:48.292 --> 09:50.694
Action.

09:52.296 --> 09:53.563
[French accent] Hello.

09:53.598 --> 09:56.299
Would you like to see
some rings, Agent Haverford?

09:56.334 --> 09:57.701
Why are you doing an accent?

09:57.735 --> 09:59.169
[normal voice] I came up with
a backstory for my character.

09:59.203 --> 10:00.637
She's married
to a French billionaire,

10:00.671 --> 10:03.440
and she has a twin sister,
identical, and they keep--

10:03.474 --> 10:04.541
Leslie, you have one line.

10:04.575 --> 10:07.244
Well, I committed to the role.

10:07.278 --> 10:08.545
[French accent] Hello.

10:08.579 --> 10:11.214
Would you like to see
some gorgeous jewelry?

10:11.249 --> 10:14.718
We have the most rare diamonds
in the world.

10:14.752 --> 10:17.888
I'll take that one.
The most expensive one.

10:17.922 --> 10:20.524
Not so fast,
Haver-fraud.

10:22.126 --> 10:23.393
Ah,<i>zut alors!</i>

10:23.427 --> 10:26.296
Get 'em, boys!

10:26.330 --> 10:28.698
Freeze!
Stunt double.

10:28.733 --> 10:30.066
Tom.

10:30.101 --> 10:31.234
Action!

10:31.269 --> 10:33.837
Go, my puppets!
Go, my puppets!

10:33.871 --> 10:37.040
Fight, fight, my puppets!

10:37.074 --> 10:38.742
Rack focus.
Pan left.

10:38.776 --> 10:40.256
I don't know
what any of that means.

10:40.278 --> 10:42.546
Just get--get the right--
go under the--

10:42.580 --> 10:44.214
Go, my puppets.

10:44.248 --> 10:45.549
Oh, that's it.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.217
Oh, you want the big dog.

10:47.251 --> 10:49.252
Is that what you want?
You want the big dog?

10:49.287 --> 10:50.987
Ahh!

10:53.925 --> 10:57.794
[groaning]

10:57.829 --> 11:00.564
Lucy, your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

11:00.598 --> 11:02.866
is to marry me.

11:02.900 --> 11:03.934
And cut.

11:03.968 --> 11:06.236
Oh, my gosh, Tom,
that was amazing!

11:06.270 --> 11:07.404
No, it wasn't.

11:07.438 --> 11:09.039
You just destroyed my case.

11:09.073 --> 11:10.841
Hey, it's
the movie business, Ted.

11:10.875 --> 11:13.043
You knew the risks.
Okay, everybody in the van.

11:13.077 --> 11:14.478
We're headed
to the next location.

11:14.512 --> 11:16.246
You should totally do it.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.781
You'd be an amazing mayor.

11:17.815 --> 11:20.784
Actually, you should
be President of the universe.

11:20.818 --> 11:22.085
Oh.

11:22.119 --> 11:24.788
You know, I really would make
an incredible mayor.

11:24.822 --> 11:27.190
But, sadly, I cannot,

11:27.225 --> 11:29.893
because I'm only 27 years old.

11:29.927 --> 11:30.861
Really?

11:30.895 --> 11:32.562
So you were born in the 1990s?

11:32.597 --> 11:34.698
[top pops]
Ooh! Mmhmm.

11:34.732 --> 11:36.666
What a lovely offer,
but I think not.

11:36.701 --> 11:38.001
You know, I've got my hands full

11:38.036 --> 11:39.669
with my practice,
my other businesses,

11:39.704 --> 11:41.638
my two terrible children.

11:41.672 --> 11:43.607
I don't think I have time
to be mayor.

11:43.641 --> 11:45.308
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,

11:45.343 --> 11:46.409
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.411
Hold up.
I will do John Mayer.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.981
Again.
[laughs]

11:51.015 --> 11:53.049
Daddy, someone set
a fire in your car

11:53.084 --> 11:55.652
♪ Because you took too long
and I got bored ♪

11:55.686 --> 11:58.388
Money, please.

11:58.422 --> 12:00.023
Oh, no, no.
There's no money.

12:00.057 --> 12:01.091
Oh.

12:01.125 --> 12:02.792
My bad.
No problem.

12:02.827 --> 12:04.361
- Oh, okay.
- That's fine.

12:04.395 --> 12:05.962
I'll just destroy this office.

12:05.997 --> 12:07.597
Whoa, hey!

12:09.801 --> 12:12.102
Money, please!

12:12.136 --> 12:13.503
[baby voice] Money, please.

12:13.538 --> 12:14.905
My money, please?

12:14.939 --> 12:18.041
Ben, give her some money.
It's easier.

12:18.075 --> 12:20.377
I have to say, The Douche,

12:20.411 --> 12:23.313
I'm skeptical that
your interest is sincere.

12:23.347 --> 12:24.307
I can understand that.

12:24.315 --> 12:26.650
A morning shock-jock DJ,
the mayor?

12:26.684 --> 12:28.051
But keep an open mind.

12:28.085 --> 12:29.352
I went to Northwestern,

12:29.387 --> 12:31.054
I've worked
on two political campaigns,

12:31.088 --> 12:33.790
and I spend all of my time
communicating with the public.

12:33.825 --> 12:35.425
That's actually a good point.

12:35.460 --> 12:37.561
I could do some great things
for this city.

12:37.595 --> 12:40.964
And some gross things with
those juicy city hall interns.

12:40.998 --> 12:42.265
Ga-ga-goink!

12:42.300 --> 12:43.300
[flatulence]

12:43.334 --> 12:46.002
Okay, well,
thanks for coming in.

12:46.037 --> 12:47.237
All right, B.
Let me know.

12:47.271 --> 12:48.972
Yeah.
Ah.

12:49.006 --> 12:50.273
Oh.

12:50.308 --> 12:51.608
Well, I think
we have our answer.

12:51.642 --> 12:53.109
Come on, think.

12:53.144 --> 12:54.578
There's got to be someone.

12:54.612 --> 12:56.980
Okay, Ben,
you know that I despise you

12:57.014 --> 12:58.782
and that I want you
and all people on Earth

12:58.816 --> 12:59.816
to be miserable, right?

12:59.851 --> 13:00.917
Sure.

13:00.952 --> 13:02.018
You should be mayor.

13:02.053 --> 13:03.520
You're the best person
for the job,

13:03.554 --> 13:04.721
and you deserve it.

13:04.755 --> 13:06.489
Plus, this would erase Ice Town.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.692
It's been torturing you
since you were 18 years old.

13:08.726 --> 13:10.560
And if you became
mayor of Pawnee,

13:10.595 --> 13:13.930
you could put it behind you
once and for all.

13:13.965 --> 13:15.098
Ugh.

13:15.132 --> 13:17.033
Being nice made me
feel terrible.

13:17.068 --> 13:19.536
- My oral office!
- What?

13:19.570 --> 13:21.538
I'm gonna turn
the mayoral office

13:21.572 --> 13:23.006
into my oral office.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.274
Boom!

13:24.308 --> 13:26.076
Thought of it a second ago,
had to pop back in.

13:26.110 --> 13:28.011
- Had to?
- Had to.

13:28.045 --> 13:29.646
Buck up, Swanson.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.715
It's like you said,
death is natural.

13:31.749 --> 13:34.184
And Sal lived a good, long life.

13:34.218 --> 13:36.419
But so much is changing,

13:36.454 --> 13:38.922
and I've never been
a fan of change.

13:38.956 --> 13:42.993
Salvatore was a constant
in my life.

13:43.027 --> 13:46.296
In my experience,
the only constant is change.

13:46.330 --> 13:48.465
Oh, shit.

13:48.499 --> 13:50.967
Nice to see you, Ron.

13:51.002 --> 13:52.802
I couldn't help but overhear.

13:52.837 --> 13:55.205
Sure am sorry about your loss.

13:55.239 --> 13:56.840
Every time we lose a compadre,

13:56.874 --> 13:59.776
our collective lantern
gets a little bit dimmer.

13:59.811 --> 14:01.044
Hey, you look awful familiar.

14:01.078 --> 14:02.179
Have we met before?

14:02.213 --> 14:04.247
Oh, I'm sure our souls
have collided

14:04.282 --> 14:05.982
in one lifetime or another.

14:06.017 --> 14:07.384
No, that's not it.

14:07.418 --> 14:08.852
Are you
in my Frisbee golf league?

14:08.886 --> 14:11.621
Oh, yeah.
I play for the Super Spinners.

14:11.656 --> 14:13.123
Oh, I'm on the Frisbee Champs.

14:13.157 --> 14:14.691
- Oh, cool.
- I named us.

14:14.726 --> 14:16.726
Andrew, stop speaking
to this man.

14:16.761 --> 14:19.062
He is the worst human being
on Earth.

14:19.096 --> 14:20.397
Oh, come on.

14:20.431 --> 14:22.499
Death makes brothers of us all.

14:22.533 --> 14:26.837
I've always found that
when my soul aches with loss,

14:26.871 --> 14:29.739
it's best to turn
to Eastern wisdom.

14:29.774 --> 14:32.709
This is from
the Isle of Islay in Scotland.

14:32.743 --> 14:35.112
This is as Eastern
as my wisdom gets.

14:35.146 --> 14:38.048
Swanson,
this handsome spiritual cowboy

14:38.082 --> 14:40.584
may actually be right
about turning to the East.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.219
I have an idea.

14:42.253 --> 14:44.755
Trust me?

14:44.789 --> 14:46.389
- Who cuts your hair?
- Nobody.

14:46.424 --> 14:49.292
Whenever my hair feels
it has completed its journey,

14:49.327 --> 14:51.361
it simply sheds itself off.

14:51.395 --> 14:54.164
I hate you so much.

14:54.198 --> 14:56.733
And I love you, my brother.

14:58.336 --> 14:59.636
I'm really glad you were here

14:59.670 --> 15:00.937
to help me with all this today.

15:00.972 --> 15:02.572
You've always been there for me.

15:02.607 --> 15:04.507
And I guess what
I'm trying to say is

15:04.542 --> 15:05.742
you're pretty cool.

15:05.776 --> 15:07.677
I'm cool?
I'm cool.

15:07.712 --> 15:09.146
I'm a cool dudette.

15:09.180 --> 15:10.680
Hey, it's pizza time.

15:10.715 --> 15:12.015
And you've lost it.

15:12.049 --> 15:13.016
No!

15:13.050 --> 15:14.351
Hey, there's Lucy.

15:16.487 --> 15:18.722
Hey, babe.

15:18.756 --> 15:19.890
We're calling this off.
It's all wrong.

15:19.924 --> 15:21.324
Oh, no.
Really?

15:21.359 --> 15:23.059
Is it because I said
"it's pizza time"?

15:23.094 --> 15:24.494
No, but that definitely
didn't help.

15:24.529 --> 15:25.796
What's happening?

15:25.830 --> 15:29.099
Grab Jean-Ralphio
and get these three things.

15:29.133 --> 15:30.767
And meet me
at The Snakehole Lounge

15:30.802 --> 15:31.802
in 30 minutes.

15:31.836 --> 15:33.157
I have no idea what's happening,

15:33.171 --> 15:34.571
and I'm very scared that
everything is falling apart,

15:34.605 --> 15:36.125
but you seem
like James Bond right now.

15:36.189 --> 15:37.187
- Go!
- Yes.

15:40.987 --> 15:42.955
Tommy T, we got you
everything you asked for.

15:42.989 --> 15:43.747
Ragaduk!

15:43.867 --> 15:45.188
I didn't ask
for flavored condoms.

15:45.202 --> 15:46.992
No, no, no, that's just me
looking out for you.

15:47.027 --> 15:49.161
See, girls get mad horny
when you propose.

15:49.196 --> 15:51.664
That's why I do it all the time.

15:51.698 --> 15:52.898
Okay, what are we doing?

15:52.933 --> 15:54.767
There are hundreds of people
waiting for us.

15:54.801 --> 15:55.868
No time to explain, Les.

15:55.902 --> 15:57.142
But don't worry, I have a plan.

15:57.170 --> 15:58.804
Fine.
I will leave.

15:58.838 --> 16:00.506
Good luck.

16:02.676 --> 16:04.343
You want to stay and hide
and watch the proposal?

16:04.377 --> 16:05.644
Yes!
Yes, of course!

16:05.679 --> 16:07.012
Okay, I already picked a place.

16:07.047 --> 16:08.347
Don't follow me!

16:08.381 --> 16:09.782
But I'm gonna, I'm gonna.

16:11.117 --> 16:12.952
I can't believe
I'm about to be the mayor.

16:12.986 --> 16:14.854
I can't believe
I'm about to notarize it.

16:14.888 --> 16:16.755
Okay, so, look,
just sign right there,

16:16.790 --> 16:19.959
and then we can let
the notary fireworks begin.

16:23.029 --> 16:25.865
You know what?
No, I don't want to do this.

16:25.899 --> 16:27.066
Why?

16:27.100 --> 16:29.969
I spent so long trying
to forget about Ice Town,

16:30.003 --> 16:32.104
but it's part of my life.

16:32.139 --> 16:33.772
I mean, it set me on this path.

16:33.807 --> 16:37.343
It led me to Pawnee,
to my job, to Leslie.

16:37.377 --> 16:39.311
I mean, who knows
where I'd be without it?

16:39.346 --> 16:41.146
I like that Ice Town happened,

16:41.181 --> 16:43.716
and I don't want to erase it.

16:43.750 --> 16:46.185
Okay, I wasn't listening
to anything you just said.

16:46.219 --> 16:49.255
But who is gonna be the mayor
for the next two months, then?

16:55.161 --> 16:56.862
Garry Gergich,

16:56.897 --> 16:59.698
how would you like to be the
next mayor of Pawnee, Indiana?

16:59.733 --> 17:01.500
[gasps]

17:01.535 --> 17:03.068
No!

17:03.103 --> 17:05.304
[screaming]

17:05.338 --> 17:07.306
What is all this?

17:07.339 --> 17:09.441
Snakehole Lounge
is where we first met.

17:09.476 --> 17:12.778
On our first date,
I gave you a single daisy,

17:12.811 --> 17:14.113
like this.

17:14.146 --> 17:16.315
And after that, we ate
late-night pancakes at JJ's.

17:16.348 --> 17:18.817
And while we were there,
I pulled out a deck of cards,

17:18.852 --> 17:20.819
and I tried to show you
a magic trick

17:20.854 --> 17:23.021
I learned off
a David Blaine special.

17:23.056 --> 17:24.723
Unsurprisingly, I failed,

17:24.758 --> 17:27.358
and you made fun of me,
ruthlessly.

17:27.394 --> 17:28.894
I haven't done this trick
in a while,

17:28.929 --> 17:30.362
but I think I'm ready
to try it again.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.298
Pick a card.

17:32.332 --> 17:33.399
No, no, no, no.

17:33.433 --> 17:35.134
Go a little bit over
to the left.

17:35.168 --> 17:37.503
There you go.

17:42.976 --> 17:44.210
Yes!

17:44.244 --> 17:45.311
- Really?
- Yes!

17:45.345 --> 17:46.312
Yay.

17:46.346 --> 17:49.515
Oh, my God, that was so sweet.

17:49.549 --> 17:50.816
It really was.

17:50.850 --> 17:52.484
So what's your story again?

17:52.519 --> 17:54.420
I mean, like,
how married are you?

17:54.454 --> 17:56.522
You down to clown?
You in that rude mood?

17:56.556 --> 17:57.756
Why are you like this?

17:57.791 --> 17:59.725
Pills, baby!
[laughs]

18:00.727 --> 18:02.194
Donna, this is crazy.

18:02.229 --> 18:03.729
Typhoon is an artist,
and the human head--

18:03.763 --> 18:05.131
Is his canvas.

18:05.165 --> 18:07.266
Just listen, you're gonna
cut the man's hair.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.235
You're gonna charge him $8.

18:09.269 --> 18:10.769
It'll take you four minutes.

18:10.804 --> 18:13.539
So just shut up and make
the man look like this.

18:13.573 --> 18:14.573
Fine.

18:14.608 --> 18:16.041
Ugh.

18:18.078 --> 18:22.381
So, Typhoon, what do you
like to do for fun?

18:22.415 --> 18:24.950
I'm writing an electronic
opera about Brittany Murphy,

18:24.985 --> 18:26.252
and I do the chandelier design

18:26.286 --> 18:28.087
for my friend's
drag puppet show.

18:28.121 --> 18:29.789
No further questions.

18:29.823 --> 18:31.524
All I really want to do
is dance.

18:31.558 --> 18:33.259
Except lately
all the good warehouse raves

18:33.293 --> 18:35.461
are filled with Eurotrash.

18:35.495 --> 18:38.464
"Eurotrash," I like that.

18:38.498 --> 18:40.533
It is, indeed,
a garbage continent.

18:40.567 --> 18:42.368
Yes.
Oh, my God.

18:42.402 --> 18:44.103
I had the worst time
in Berlin last May.

18:44.137 --> 18:45.971
Everyone was
on their stupid bikes.

18:46.006 --> 18:47.306
I was like, "Ew."

18:47.340 --> 18:49.008
[laughs]

18:49.042 --> 18:52.144
Please, talk more about how
you hate Europe and bicycles.

18:54.247 --> 18:55.581
Sorry about the audible.

18:55.615 --> 18:56.895
I just realized
Lucy doesn't care

18:56.917 --> 18:58.050
about all that flashy stuff.

18:58.084 --> 18:59.485
That's not the way to her heart.

18:59.519 --> 19:01.120
Frankly, I'm stunned
she's still even into me.

19:01.154 --> 19:03.022
No, you were right
to change course.

19:03.056 --> 19:04.790
It was perfect and beautiful.

19:04.824 --> 19:06.759
There's still
a very big celebration

19:06.793 --> 19:08.561
awaiting you and your fiancée.

19:08.595 --> 19:11.363
I think Lucy probably wants
to hang just the two of us.

19:11.398 --> 19:13.232
I'll see you later,
Jennifer Knopez.

19:13.266 --> 19:15.234
Catch you on the flip side,
Tom-egranate Juice.

19:15.268 --> 19:16.569
Hey, not bad.

19:16.603 --> 19:19.505
[cell phone chimes]

19:19.539 --> 19:20.940
Hey, babe.

19:20.974 --> 19:22.308
Tom got engaged.

19:22.342 --> 19:24.210
Oh, that's awesome.

19:24.244 --> 19:25.778
More good news.

19:25.812 --> 19:27.913
I finally found someone
to be mayor--

19:27.948 --> 19:29.248
Garry.

19:29.282 --> 19:30.649
Oh, so glad we're leaving.

19:30.684 --> 19:32.751
Wait, you know what?

19:32.786 --> 19:35.187
I just had an amazing idea.

19:35.222 --> 19:37.022
Just under the wire.

19:37.090 --> 19:39.225
Oh, Ian, thank you so much.

19:39.259 --> 19:41.193
It's great.
Now throw it out.

19:41.228 --> 19:43.195
I need a new one,
and I need it in 20 minutes.

19:43.230 --> 19:44.196
Ugh.

19:44.231 --> 19:45.271
Look, if you didn't want

19:45.298 --> 19:47.032
to be on call 24-7
for emergencies,

19:47.067 --> 19:48.734
then you should not have gone
into the high-stakes world

19:48.768 --> 19:49.935
of banner making!

19:52.223 --> 19:53.544
What the hell is all this about?

19:53.558 --> 19:55.359
You'll see.

19:55.393 --> 19:57.461
Well, I got to say,

19:57.495 --> 19:59.164
that was a heck of a lot of fun.

20:01.551 --> 20:02.658
What on Earth?

20:02.778 --> 20:05.465
Happy Inauguration Day, buddy.

20:05.715 --> 20:07.664
Oh, jeez, Leslie.

20:30.342 --> 20:33.444
The passing of our beloved Mayor Gunderson

20:33.564 --> 20:35.690
marks the end of an era.

20:35.999 --> 20:38.407
But we are about to begin a new chapter

20:38.527 --> 20:39.910
in Pawnee's history.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.351
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:41.471 --> 20:44.969
the new mayor of the great city of
Pawnee, Indiana,

20:45.089 --> 20:46.226
Garry Gergich.

20:47.565 --> 20:49.779
I just want to say...

20:58.164 --> 20:59.864
I'm flying!
