what they're up to.

The mission is need-to-know,
and apparently I don't
need to know.

becausethey
saw us together.

Because I'm supposed
to be dead.

be accepting my reasons.

for both of us.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.662

the police for a while,

12:37.507 --> 12:39.839
but I'm gonna need
to give Carlos something.

with Kellog.

from them.

through this ifwe trust
each other, Kiera.

the same thing.

see her anymore?

asking for help later
from behind bars.

You're asking me
about somebody I
got no interest in.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.999
But I'll tell you something
for free. Liber8.

you wanted me to do?

Um,

15:13.455 --> 15:14.661

that Liber8 was behind this?
Of course he did.

you remove a problem for him.

from Piron phones.

from our hack.

But I'm your
Achilles heel.

42:29.631 --> 42:32.247
I'm not badass enough
to keep putting
you in danger.

42:33.593 --> 42:35.208
Don't ask me to
be that person.

42:38.598 --> 42:40.759
I can't let you go.
I'm not giving you a choice.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.348
We have a future,
you know that.

42:42.644 --> 42:45.886
What I know
doesn't change
how I feel about you.

42:46.940 --> 42:48.646
Butlhaveto
protect both of us.

42:49.609 --> 42:51.395
And this is the only way
I know how to do that.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.077
Emily, Emily.
