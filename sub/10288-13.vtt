14:48.488 --> 14:49.717
No.

14:49.889 --> 14:55.658
You know, most people can't take this
without water.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.089
Your Honor, how long has all this
been going on?

15:00.266 --> 15:02.792
How long has what been going on?

15:02.969 --> 15:07.736
The wigs and the horns and the subscription
to WrestleMania magazine.

15:09.609 --> 15:13.307
You know, Judge Hirsch, I am considered
a bit of a maverick around here myself.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.708
Yeah, word in the halls is you're a flake.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.382
I have my moments.

15:19.552 --> 15:23.420
The point is that I use the gags
and the tricks as a release.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.388
It's to ease the tension, that's all.

15:26.559 --> 15:31.793
It's when it gets taken to an extreme,
when it begins to obstruct justice...

15:31.964 --> 15:37.130
...then it threatens to dismantle
our entire judicial system.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.234
What's your point?

15:43.342 --> 15:46.607
If you don't step down,
I am personally going to file a petition...

15:46.779 --> 15:49.680
...requesting that you be removed
from the bench.

15:52.785 --> 15:57.279
So it comes down to a gunfight, eh?

15:57.457 --> 15:58.982
If need be.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.282
Who draws first?

16:00.460 --> 16:04.727
That usually determines
who wins in these things, right?

16:14.907 --> 16:17.376
Can I, uh, be of some help?

16:17.543 --> 16:19.773
Where the hell is the Corsetti file?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.047
I lined my shoes with it.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.442
You did what?

16:26.619 --> 16:30.556
I didn't think you'd need it anymore.
We finished with the case hours ago.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.122
Finished? How?

16:32.291 --> 16:34.055
Well, the cop's testimony was shaky...

16:34.227 --> 16:37.197
...so I plea-bargained down
to burglary, third degree.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.832
Comes up before grand jury Wednesday.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.560
Oh, God. Wednesdays, I give my blood.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.239
Don't worry. I'll follow through for you.

16:47.406 --> 16:48.464
What a pal.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.440
Don't touch me. I'm not your pal!

16:51.611 --> 16:55.479
You are a disgusting, filthy.
slimy shell 01a human being...

16:55.648 --> 16:59.516
...and you ought to crawl back
into the sewer from which you slithered.

17:00.887 --> 17:03.982
I got a 97 percent conviction rate.

17:05.358 --> 17:09.352
I hear you're batting about 500.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.758
HIRSCH: Wait. What's the matter?
Where are you going?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.502
We haven't finished.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.729
You are finished, Judge Hirsch.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.874
I'm gonna go call for an ambulance.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.703
An ambulance? Are you sick?

17:25.778 --> 17:26.939
I'll be right back.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.649
- You wanna hear a funny story, Harry?
- Your Honor--

17:30.816 --> 17:36.983
There was this girl, 17, beautiful girl,
dark complexion, dark hair...

17:37.156 --> 17:41.354
...and a welt under her eye
where her husband had hither.

17:42.995 --> 17:45.123
She was pregnant for the third time,
I think.

17:45.298 --> 17:49.633
And the DA said they lived in
a rat-infested place on the Lower East Side.

17:49.802 --> 17:52.635
She said she wanted her husband
to stop hitting her.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.137
As soon as I indicated
that I'd send him to jail...

17:55.308 --> 17:59.211
...zip, she changed her testimony,
said she was lying.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.506
She didn't want her husband
to go to jail.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.309
He brought home money
so the family can eat.

18:04.483 --> 18:07.885
All she wanted was for him
to stop hitting her!

18:08.054 --> 18:11.080
Well, Harry, I can't make him stop!

18:11.257 --> 18:16.127
In 25 years,
I've never made anybody stop!

18:22.501 --> 18:23.832
I'm sorry.

18:25.504 --> 18:26.903
God's in his heaven...

18:27.073 --> 18:32.534
...but all's not quite right in the world.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.208
I know how you feel.

18:36.682 --> 18:38.411
How long have you been on the bench?

18:38.818 --> 18:39.842
Three years.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.386
Ha-ha-ha. Three years.

18:42.555 --> 18:46.856
I've had bouts of irregularity
longer than that.

[SIGHS]

18:51.097 --> 18:54.465

18:57.203 --> 19:01.800
Uh, coloring a little piggy...

19:01.974 --> 19:05.740
...and a monster with a blond wig.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.912
Am I sick, Harry?

19:10.616 --> 19:12.516
Maybe a little.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.817
But mostly...

19:15.488 --> 19:17.513
...I'd say you're real, real tired.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.885
Oh, tired.

19:19.058 --> 19:24.360
Oh, I could sleep for a million years.
Ha, ha.

19:24.630 --> 19:25.961
Yeah.

19:26.132 --> 19:31.593
If the bed they strap me down to
is comfortable, I probably will.

19:33.372 --> 19:37.206
See, I tried to do it all right.

19:37.376 --> 19:40.573
I tried to right all the wrongs...

19:40.746 --> 19:44.478
...reverse all of the injustices.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.142
I guess I was wrong.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.514
It's impossible.

19:49.455 --> 19:52.914
Even a tool knows that we can't reach out
and touch the stars...

19:53.092 --> 19:56.289
...but that does not stop
the wise man from trying.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.330
I like that.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.061
Who said that?

20:01.233 --> 20:02.667
You did.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.463
It was in a speech to the bar association.

20:07.473 --> 20:08.998
Here.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.615
You can never have...

20:16.782 --> 20:18.546

I'll wear it with honor, sir.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.721
You do that.

20:24.256 --> 20:26.281
I gotta go.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.200
Oh, there's no need.

20:39.371 --> 20:44.866
There's probably a whole army
of paramedics waiting for me out front.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.534
Well...

20:46.712 --> 20:50.080

...inside the lines.

Oh, thank you, sir.

I didn't know whether to bring them in
one at a time or all in a row kicking.

I'm sure you would have made
the right decision.
