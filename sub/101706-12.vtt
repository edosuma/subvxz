for In Depthmagazine.

epidemic of violence

07:42.679 --> 07:44.376
against Native American women.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.769
Definitely an eye-opener.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.858
RHD's running point
on this.

07:47.902 --> 07:50.513
The working theory is that
it was a home invasion.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.820
Well, her place in
Highland Park was cleaned out.

07:52.863 --> 07:55.823
Electronics, jewelry,
they even emptied her safe.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.781
Yeah, my biggest concern
with that report is that

07:57.825 --> 08:00.305
the footprints at the crime
scene indicate four suspects.

08:00.349 --> 08:01.742
So, even with Ramiro
locked up, that leaves

08:01.785 --> 08:03.308
three suspects on the loose.

08:03.352 --> 08:06.747
State Department says Ramiro is
ex-Guatemalan military.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.836
Now, they suspect
he's a stateside fixer

08:08.879 --> 08:11.578
for his cronies back home,
but Feds have never had

08:11.621 --> 08:13.318
anything solid to pin on him.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.930
Well, L.A.'s got the largest
Guatemalan community in the U.S.

08:15.973 --> 08:18.454
That means lots of political
enemies to squeeze,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.456
undocumented workers
to extort.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.632
But if your M.O. is
to target your own people,

08:22.676 --> 08:25.983
why the hell would you kill
an American reporter?

08:26.027 --> 08:28.290
And what about the text?
"Finish it."

08:28.333 --> 08:30.597
I mean, if that went to
his three killer buddies...

08:30.640 --> 08:32.076
If this is more
than a robbery,

08:32.120 --> 08:34.209
Ramiro killed Angela
for some reason.

08:34.252 --> 08:37.995
Best way to
figure out the why

08:38.039 --> 08:39.170
could be where it happened.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.399
DEACON:
RHD report called it.

08:50.442 --> 08:52.967
The killers used blind spots
to avoid the security cams,

08:53.010 --> 08:54.490
cut the cable line,

08:54.534 --> 08:55.926
disabled the entire system,
then made entry.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.635
It sure seems like she made
the most of the years she had.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.682

miss her.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.741
Everything in here
screams a robbery.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.743
But Ramiro's an abuser.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.788
He wouldn't need a crew
to take down just one woman.

09:31.832 --> 09:34.574
You're right, it's overkill.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.227
Feels like Angela
knew something

09:36.271 --> 09:37.881
or-or had something
that Ramiro wanted.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.013
The question is what.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.755
Maybe his daughters
know something.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.063
Okay.

09:48.544 --> 09:51.068
I'll be right back.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.505

09:53.549 --> 09:56.683
It took me a while to calm
them down, Eme especially.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.598
Glad they're doing better.

09:58.641 --> 10:01.078
Once I got them talking,
we made some good progress.

10:01.122 --> 10:04.516
Did you get a chance
to ask our questions?I did.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.258
Eme said there were
some men at her house yesterday

10:07.302 --> 10:09.434
talking with Ramiro,
but she didn't know them.

10:09.478 --> 10:10.435
Did she say how many?

10:10.479 --> 10:13.003
Three, all of them Guatemalan.

10:13.047 --> 10:16.093
Eme said they were looking
at pictures on their phones.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.095
Pictures?
Of a place or people?

10:18.139 --> 10:20.620
People, but she didn't
recognize any of them.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.056
And that's it for now.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.579
I don't want
to push them too much,

10:23.623 --> 10:25.059
the way they've already
been traumatized.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.930
Um,

10:26.974 --> 10:29.890
were they able to tell you
anything about their mom at all?

10:29.933 --> 10:33.023
Eme was five the last time
she saw her mother,

10:33.067 --> 10:35.417
has no idea
what happened to her.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.462
Nimla was too young
to remember anything.

10:37.506 --> 10:40.161
We're searching for relatives,
but they're probably looking

10:40.204 --> 10:42.554
at a foster placement
in the short term.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.078
I just hope I can
keep them together.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.822
My gut says

10:48.865 --> 10:51.781
those three guys helped
Ramiro murder that reporter.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.436
And "finish it" means maybe they
have more people to go after.

10:54.479 --> 10:55.872
Yeah.
[phone buzzing]

10:57.091 --> 11:00.877
Um, can you get the info
on the photos to the team

11:00.921 --> 11:03.097
so we can get a warrant
on Ramiro's phone?

11:03.140 --> 11:04.272
What are you gonna do?

11:04.315 --> 11:05.926
I want to talk
to Eme and Nimla.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.102
I know DCFS will do
everything they can,

11:08.145 --> 11:09.886
but talking to someone

11:09.930 --> 11:11.888
who's actually lived through
the same thing might help.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.281
Maybe stir up some memories

11:13.324 --> 11:15.892
about her mom
and how to find her.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.897
There he is-- "Special Tactics
and Training Liaison."

11:20.941 --> 11:23.465
Yeah, right.
If there's a pool going

11:23.508 --> 11:25.467
on how many times someone
can say that today,

11:25.510 --> 11:26.903
my money's on Street.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.949
You know it's all love.Always, man.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.559
So, you got
something for us?

11:30.602 --> 11:32.126
Yeah, those little girls
put us on the right track.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.563
A warrant from Ramiro's
phone got us faces.

11:34.606 --> 11:35.738
Well, I'm guessing
no names

11:35.782 --> 11:37.305
since you didn't lead with that.Nada.

11:37.348 --> 11:40.090
But I got RHD's download
of Angela's phone

11:40.134 --> 11:42.136
and cloud files.
One thing jumped out.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.790
All of her work files
are missing.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.182
Well, if her murder's
connected to her work,

11:45.226 --> 11:46.488
then maybe our mystery men

11:46.531 --> 11:48.316
and woman were part
of a story of hers.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.709
One that got
Angela killed

11:49.752 --> 11:51.319
and turned those four
into additional targets.

11:51.362 --> 11:52.799
Okay, I'll call Angela's editor.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.191
Maybe he can tell us
what she was working on.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.019
All right. Get on it.

11:56.063 --> 11:59.370
Going off Ramiro's history,
crimes against his own people,

11:59.414 --> 12:00.807
I think it's
pretty likely

12:00.850 --> 12:02.330
that our unknown
subjects are Guatemalan.

12:02.373 --> 12:03.766
That's probably
a safe bet.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.246
Angela wrote stories
to put out hard truths,

12:05.289 --> 12:06.987
and Guatemala's
a volatile country

12:07.030 --> 12:09.119
with a lot of bad
recent history.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.817
The news of her being
killed is already out there.Do you think

12:10.860 --> 12:12.906
the four people in those photos
know they're in danger?

12:12.949 --> 12:14.864
If so, they're probably
already hiding underground.

12:14.908 --> 12:18.128
I might know somebody
that can help us find them.

12:19.129 --> 12:22.785
[knocking]Sir? I, uh,

12:22.829 --> 12:25.614
just wanted
to get your okay on something.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.922
I was asking the social worker

12:28.965 --> 12:32.186
if we could keep Eme
and Nimla here a little longer.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.754
I'm just, uh... I'm trying
to get some intel on their mom.

12:36.059 --> 12:38.627
See if we can keep 'em together
and out of the system.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.194
And I know it's not my job.

12:40.237 --> 12:43.501
I just... wanted to try.

12:44.546 --> 12:49.029
Those girls got the short end
of the stick in the dad lottery.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.987
It's a father's job
to look after his daughter.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.469
Protect her from anyone
looking to do her harm.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.733
The girls can stay here
the rest of the day,

12:57.777 --> 12:59.387
but that's as much time
as I can give you.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.911
Thank you, sir. I'll, uh,
let you get back to, uh...

13:03.521 --> 13:05.523
Thank you.

13:06.568 --> 13:09.353
I was gonna try and take Darryl
myself, but I'm caught up here.

13:09.397 --> 13:12.748
Well, I'm very impressed
by how hard Darryl's fighting

13:12.792 --> 13:15.185
to be part of his son's life,
and I'm happy to pitch in.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.796
Thanks, Winnie.
I owe you one.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.755
Hey, listen, have you seen
or heard from Pop today?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.410
I left him some voice mails,
but he hasn't hit me back.No.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.455
I haven't talked
to him in a few days.Wait a minute.

13:24.499 --> 13:25.805
I thought he'd been over there,
helping you unpack

13:25.848 --> 13:27.197
from your move down from Vegas.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.025
Yeah, he was pretty helpful
the first few days,

13:29.069 --> 13:31.114
but the last couple...Don't tell me.

13:31.158 --> 13:32.637
Y'all got into it?No.

13:32.681 --> 13:35.031
We've been pleasant.
Surprised me, actually.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.642
But... Hondo...

13:37.686 --> 13:39.644
Dad hasn't been at Mom's
all week, either.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.124
We thought he was with you.

13:41.168 --> 13:43.692
No, something must be going on
with him.

13:43.735 --> 13:46.695
Look, I'm probably not supposed
to say anything,

13:46.738 --> 13:49.306
but Darryl isn't the only one
Dad canceled on.

13:50.481 --> 13:51.874
Yeah, he blew off some plans
with Mama, too.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.267
After everything he did

13:53.310 --> 13:54.442
to get that woman
to trust him again.

13:54.485 --> 13:55.922
That doesn't make any sense.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.445
Hondo, I don't know
if you remember--

13:57.488 --> 13:59.186
we were just teenagers then--

13:59.229 --> 14:01.014
but those last few weeks
before he left us...

14:01.057 --> 14:02.842
I remember.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.931
He started picking fights
and making himself scarce.Mm-hmm.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.933
And then he just left town
with another woman.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.195
I'm not saying

14:08.238 --> 14:09.674
that's what's happening here,

14:09.718 --> 14:12.460
but, um,
I've seen this pattern before.

14:12.503 --> 14:13.809
Pop's playboy days
are long behind him.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.158
He hasn't had
eyes for no one

14:15.202 --> 14:16.638
but Mama since
he came back here.

14:16.681 --> 14:19.989
Well, we thought he only had
eyes for her back then, too.

14:22.731 --> 14:24.864
I believe he's changed, Winnie.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.735
Change doesn't always last.

14:35.352 --> 14:37.746
[gunfire]

14:41.968 --> 14:44.666
Hey. You making any headway

14:44.709 --> 14:46.537
on finding their mom?Nope.

14:46.581 --> 14:49.758
Hopefully, I'll keep my job
long enough to find some leads.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.194
That sounds like a story.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.283
I think Hicks knows
I broke up with Molly.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.025
He was so chilly with me
just now in his office.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.984
I'm lucky
I didn't get frostbite.Yeah, well,

14:58.027 --> 14:59.724
I'm gonna be a good friend
and not say

14:59.768 --> 15:01.509
I told you not to date
the boss's daughter, but...

15:01.552 --> 15:03.250
You're very kind.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.425
Tan said the same thing.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.862
[chuckles]And Hicks was fine.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.429
Professional.

15:08.472 --> 15:11.345
He's probably just plotting
some future torture for me.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.390
I should say something,
though, right? I...

15:13.434 --> 15:14.957
Not wait for him to bring it up?

15:15.001 --> 15:16.263
Oh, you're gonna start
taking my advice

15:16.306 --> 15:17.351
about Hicks and Molly now?

15:18.787 --> 15:20.049
Look, you having
any second thoughts?

15:20.093 --> 15:21.833
About the breakup? No.

15:21.877 --> 15:25.359
No, Molly deserves someone
who is 100% in.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.274
And once I realized
that wasn't me,

15:27.317 --> 15:29.711
it wasn't fair
to drag things out.All right.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.800
You're gonna say something
to Hicks, say that.

15:31.843 --> 15:34.411
It might keep you out
of the boss's penalty box.

15:34.455 --> 15:35.935
You get wise over there
in Germany?

15:35.978 --> 15:37.414
Nah, you just got wise enough

15:37.458 --> 15:39.242
to finally notice my brilliance.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.375
That must be it.[laughs]

15:43.638 --> 15:45.379
How'd you hear about this place?

15:45.422 --> 15:47.555
There was a debate in my
church group about the legality

15:47.598 --> 15:49.209
of these humanitarian
organizations.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.820
They set up these waystations
for undocumented immigrants,

15:51.863 --> 15:54.083
provide food, water,
medical supplies.

15:54.127 --> 15:56.390
Well, you got to figure
they're pretty well-known

15:56.433 --> 15:58.305
in the local
Latin American community.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.872
Sounds like a place I'd go
for help if I needed to hide.

16:00.916 --> 16:04.006
[scoffs] Everyone
who works here is legal.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.052
I have their paperwork.We're not here
to hassle anyone.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.401
We just have a
few questions.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.403
You Oscar DeLeon?

16:09.446 --> 16:11.274
I am.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.450
The last time the cops said
they weren't here

16:13.494 --> 16:15.452
to hassle me,
I got shut down for a full day.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.933
Well, we wouldn't be on your
doorstep if it wasn't important.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.587
Sir, there are lives at stake.

16:19.630 --> 16:20.588
Yeah, whose lives?

16:20.631 --> 16:21.937
Four Guatemalan immigrants.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.549
We think they were working with
a magazine reporter on a story.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.902
That reporter, she was
murdered yesterday.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.078
And we think that
the men that did it

16:32.121 --> 16:33.557
are coming after
those four next.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.342
You think they came
through one of our waystations?

16:35.385 --> 16:36.604
People come to you for help,

16:36.647 --> 16:37.779
so, yeah,
we think maybe they did.

16:37.822 --> 16:40.216
Well, if you're right...

16:40.260 --> 16:42.436
they made a choice
to hide on their own

16:42.479 --> 16:44.438
instead of coming to the police.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.961
You know why?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.876
Because authority in Guatemala
represents danger?

16:47.919 --> 16:49.921
We get that.

16:51.314 --> 16:52.924
Oh, do you?

16:52.968 --> 16:55.057
Yeah, I'm from Guatemala.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.754
Faced off with their so-called
government myself

16:56.798 --> 16:58.408
before I had to run for my life.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.802
Look, my family
immigrated here, too.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.456
My mom's still got
relatives in Hong Kong.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.762
They tell us stories about
what's happening there.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.938
Rights stripped away,
protests quashed.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.810
I know things in your country
aren't much different.

17:08.853 --> 17:12.205
They're not always much
different here, Officer.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.512
The men that killed
that reporter,

17:15.556 --> 17:17.079
we think that they're muscle

17:17.123 --> 17:19.212
for some heavy hitters
down in Guatemala.

17:19.255 --> 17:22.041
They had no problem
taking one life already.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.738
Everything you do here's
about saving lives.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.044
Help us do the same.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.352
[exhales]
I don't know them.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.399
But I hope someone
can help them.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.705
Okay. Thank you for your time.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.109
I don't think he's sold on us
yet, but he's thinking about it.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.024
Better than nothing.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.895
[phone beeping]

17:50.939 --> 17:52.941
Shooting in Little Guatemala.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.989
[siren wailing]

17:58.033 --> 17:59.469
[panting]

17:59.513 --> 18:01.689
30-David on site.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.042
Making entry.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.871
Move, move, move, move.

18:10.872 --> 18:12.830
Where are the shooters?

18:12.874 --> 18:14.702
There's only one.
I don't know where he went.

18:14.745 --> 18:15.703
How many other employees?

18:15.746 --> 18:17.183
Two, including the owner.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.228
[tires screech]

18:20.403 --> 18:22.013
[faint gunshots]

18:22.057 --> 18:24.668
DEACON: 30-David,
active shooter, gunfire!

18:24.712 --> 18:26.627
Deep interior, at least
two civilians on site.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.543
Only one shooter seen.20-David on scene.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.197
CHRIS [over radio]:
Street and I are three out.[gunshots]

18:31.240 --> 18:32.154
He's still chasing someone.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.503
All right, let's move.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.685
Move, move. Come on.

18:46.821 --> 18:50.172
Ma'am. I'm LAPD.
Are you all right?

18:50.216 --> 18:51.782
[sobbing]:
My leg. My leg.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.741
This is 20-David.
Female gunshot victim,

18:53.784 --> 18:55.917
right calf wound,
conscious, breathing.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.353
We got you.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.138
Help's on the way.Okay.

19:10.323 --> 19:13.413
DEACON:
There's another person
hiding behind the stacks.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.545
Tan, F.B. on tap.

19:28.645 --> 19:31.170
LAPD SWAT! Drop your weapon!

19:34.477 --> 19:36.436
[high-pitched droning]

19:40.962 --> 19:42.137
Hands!

19:42.181 --> 19:44.444
Hands behind your head!
Don't move!

19:48.056 --> 19:49.188
You okay?

19:50.798 --> 19:53.279
This is 20-David, we're Code 4.
Shooter in custody.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.455
Hondo?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.984
We got a match?Saved one.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.029
That's a start.

20:09.164 --> 20:12.167
Luca, got a call from RHD.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.300
The guy we arrested at
the warehouse, he's not talking,

20:14.343 --> 20:16.084
but his boot print matches one
we found at Angela's house.

20:16.127 --> 20:17.390
And I assume he lawyered up?

20:17.433 --> 20:18.608
He won't speak to ask for one.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.262
He wouldn't even give his name.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.264
Man, Ramiro focused on getting
that text off before his arrest.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.266
Now this guy won't spill
anything?

20:24.310 --> 20:25.876
Makes you wonder
what's behind all this.

20:28.618 --> 20:31.186
DEACON:
Your friends were
no longer at the motel.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.319
We sent units to check, Ricky,
but there was no sign of them.

20:33.362 --> 20:35.843
We split up
when we found out about Angela.

20:35.886 --> 20:38.149
The owner of the warehouse,
he knows my family.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.804
He was going to give me
a ride out of town.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.676
What do you know about
the men that are hunting
you and your friends?

20:42.719 --> 20:45.244
Nothing. I swear.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.550
Someone sent
your photos to them.

20:47.594 --> 20:51.075
Okay, they were hired
to kill all of you.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.555
We made some enemies.

20:52.599 --> 20:53.904
Back home.DEACON:
What do you mean?

20:53.948 --> 20:55.254
How?

20:57.038 --> 21:00.476
Edwin and Marta are training
to be doctors.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.912
They came to help
with all the sickness

21:01.956 --> 21:03.479
going on in the backcountry.

21:03.523 --> 21:06.177
Carlos and I,
we grew up together,

21:06.221 --> 21:08.571
working the farms.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.226
Well, those don't seem like
life choices that make enemies.

21:12.271 --> 21:16.492
Carlos's brother led
a human rights group,

21:16.536 --> 21:20.975
and there was a mine that was
poisoning our farms.

21:21.018 --> 21:23.586
The corrupt politicians
who run our country

21:23.630 --> 21:26.241
just let them keep destroying
our crops.

21:26.285 --> 21:30.201
So we blocked the mine,
shut it down.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.380
Soldiers came...

21:34.423 --> 21:37.078
fired tear gas.

21:37.121 --> 21:39.123
Gunshots.

21:42.823 --> 21:45.129
[voice breaking]:
Beat people.

21:46.653 --> 21:48.829
But we recorded everything.

21:48.872 --> 21:51.048
We were trying to get it
to the media.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.660
Did the government get
in your way?

21:53.703 --> 21:55.705
The reporters who agreed
to broadcast the video

21:55.749 --> 21:58.534
were arrested.

21:58.578 --> 22:01.232
Then Carlos's brother
was murdered.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.147
We were afraid
we would be next.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.150
So you came to L.A.
and you thought that

22:06.194 --> 22:08.762
coverage in the U.S. media
might get someone

22:08.805 --> 22:09.806
to help your people.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.244
How did you team up
with Angela?

22:13.288 --> 22:16.596
Carlos staked out
the magazine office.

22:16.639 --> 22:19.425
He wanted his brother's death
to matter.

22:19.468 --> 22:22.950
Angela bought us a phone,
said to only call using it.

22:22.993 --> 22:26.736
Who has the phone now?Carlos.

22:26.780 --> 22:31.611
When Angela did not answer
his calls, he went to her house.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.003
Saw the police cars.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.877
We didn't know who killed her,

22:36.920 --> 22:39.314
but Carlos said
we had to hide again.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.621
I'll look at her financials to
track the burner phone purchase.

22:41.664 --> 22:43.884
Maybe get a location
on Carlos from that.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.755
Angela, she-she was just
trying to help us.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.409
W-We never meant for anything
to happen to...

22:47.453 --> 22:51.805
Hey-hey-hey, it's not on
you... or your friends.

22:51.848 --> 22:53.110
It's on the people
who killed her.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.418
And it's on us to find 'em.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.686
Everything all right?

23:05.427 --> 23:07.951
Joan just talked Eme and Nimla
through Ramiro's arrest,

23:07.995 --> 23:10.040
what it means.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.478
They're confused, terrified
of being separated.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.610
They've had a rough
road, for sure.

23:14.654 --> 23:17.613
Thanks to their father,
it might stay that way.What do you mean?

23:17.657 --> 23:20.660
He's been altering their
official records for years.

23:20.703 --> 23:23.402
It's making it very difficult
to track their real history.

23:23.445 --> 23:26.840
But if he went to all that
trouble, hopefully it means

23:26.883 --> 23:28.363
their mom's out
there somewhere.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.280
I'm doing a good thing.

23:32.323 --> 23:34.978
Yes, you are,
and I hope it works out.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.502
Those are sweet kids.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.547
They deserve a shot
at a real life.Then why the look?

23:38.591 --> 23:40.549
Who's in the hospital?

23:40.593 --> 23:42.377
I saw someone trying
to call your phone.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.683
I told you
that it's nothing.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.162
If it's nothing,
then answer me.

23:47.556 --> 23:51.125
My mom has been sick
for a while, apparently.

23:51.168 --> 23:55.564
Um, they transferred her
from the prison infirmary

23:55.608 --> 23:56.609
to Pleasant Green Hospital.

23:56.652 --> 23:59.525
I'm really sorry to hear that.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.744
You talk to her, see her?

24:01.788 --> 24:04.312
No. I told you, I'm done
trying to save her.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.532
So instead you're trying
to save these girls,

24:06.575 --> 24:09.056
looking for a mother they
haven't seen in seven years.

24:09.099 --> 24:11.058
That's a little simplistic,
don't you think?

24:11.101 --> 24:12.538
Sometimes life is simple.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.409
Sometimes our choices
are simple.

24:15.541 --> 24:18.369
Karen has never come through
for you, and it's good

24:18.413 --> 24:19.893
you don't want to get
sucked back in.

24:19.936 --> 24:22.199
But burying your feelings
in someone else's problems

24:22.243 --> 24:23.766
doesn't make them go away.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.422
You mean, like pretending your
feelings for me don't exist

24:27.466 --> 24:28.554
doesn't make them
go away, either?

24:28.597 --> 24:30.164
Don't go there.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.775
Just saying.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.347
LUCA:
Mr. Garrett.Yeah.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.958
Sorry it took so long
to get down here.

24:42.002 --> 24:45.701
You, uh, you can imagine, things
at the magazine have been crazy.

24:45.745 --> 24:47.398
No, I appreciate you
coming down.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.052
I was hoping that you could
tell me about the article

24:49.096 --> 24:51.011
that Angela was writing.

24:51.054 --> 24:52.621
Maybe help us build
a suspect list.

24:52.665 --> 24:55.189
I wish I could,
but, uh, you know,

24:55.232 --> 24:57.191
Angela was always
secretive about her work.

24:57.234 --> 24:58.584
You know, she never
sent us an article

24:58.627 --> 25:00.150
until it was ready for legal.

25:00.194 --> 25:03.893
But human rights violations--
now, that's Angela's turf.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.982
Said it was the right
work to be doing.

25:06.026 --> 25:08.550
She sounds like
someone special.
Yeah.

25:08.594 --> 25:09.899
Were you able to find
those records I asked for?

25:09.943 --> 25:13.337
My secretary pulled her
expense report receipts.

25:13.381 --> 25:14.774
What are you trying
to track down?

25:14.817 --> 25:16.123
A cell phone purchase.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.690
Angela may have been talking
to her sources on it.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.996
This will help us run it down.
I appreciate it. Thank you.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.824
Hey, um...

25:21.868 --> 25:24.174
for what it's worth, I, uh...

25:25.611 --> 25:27.482
I might know why someone is
willing to kill

25:27.526 --> 25:28.875
over this article.

25:28.918 --> 25:29.876
All right. Lay it on me.

25:29.919 --> 25:31.704
Well, there's an aid package

25:31.747 --> 25:33.836
that's pending U.S.
congressional approval.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.577
Aid for Guatemala?
Yes.

25:35.621 --> 25:38.624
Now, if Angela's sources
had video of the army

25:38.667 --> 25:41.627
quashing humanitarian
protests violently...

25:41.670 --> 25:43.498
That might make a senator
or two think twice about

25:43.542 --> 25:45.500
sending that money.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.590
Enough to give someone
a reason to get violent.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.200
[phone buzzes]

25:50.244 --> 25:52.551
Hey, what's good, D?
You and Winnie on the move?

25:52.594 --> 25:53.552
Not exactly.

25:53.595 --> 25:54.857
Your pops is here.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.511
Oh, good, I've been
trying to track him down.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.339
Well, he's here,
and him and your sister

25:58.382 --> 25:59.558
have been really getting
into it.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.602
I don't have to report
my comings and goings

26:00.646 --> 26:01.603
to my own kids.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.387
I'm a grown man.What's going on?

26:03.431 --> 26:05.389
It looks like he's packing
all his stuff,

26:05.433 --> 26:07.304
like he's never gonna come back.

26:07.348 --> 26:09.480
WINNIE:
You are acting like a fool.Hold on a second.

26:09.524 --> 26:10.612
You can't just
up and leave folks.

26:10.656 --> 26:11.526
Get Winnie for me.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.223
Except I forgot,

26:13.267 --> 26:14.834
I forgot who I'm talking to.
That's your go-to move.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.618
Hey, you didn't want me
back here in the first place,

26:16.662 --> 26:17.967
so what do you care if I leave?

26:18.011 --> 26:19.534
You know what, old man,
I shouldn't care.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.711
But you ain't breaking
my mama's heart or mine again

26:22.755 --> 26:24.800
without hearing what
I think of you.Ms. Harrelson.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.019
Can I talk to you for a second?

26:26.062 --> 26:27.411
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
what you doing?

26:28.282 --> 26:29.544
You calling to rat me out?

26:29.588 --> 26:30.763
Hey, well, go ahead.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.286
You can tell my son I don't need

26:32.329 --> 26:34.375
his two cents either.

26:37.247 --> 26:39.119
Hondo, I don't know what to do.

26:39.162 --> 26:41.121
He won't talk about anything.
He won't listen to a word I say.

26:41.164 --> 26:43.558
He's really just gonna take off?Yeah.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.474
He says he's got things to do,
won't say more than that.

26:46.517 --> 26:47.954
I'll get into it.
You just make sure Darryl gets

26:47.997 --> 26:49.085
to that appointment, okay?

26:49.129 --> 26:50.565
You want me to just
leave Dad here?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.175
I'm at work, I can't
get there right away.

26:52.219 --> 26:54.090
But you give him
a message for me.

26:54.134 --> 26:55.222
You tell him if he leaves

26:55.265 --> 26:56.266
without talking to me
face-to-face,

26:56.310 --> 26:57.485
he's burned that bridge
for good.

27:02.882 --> 27:05.058
STREET:
Commander?
What do you got?

27:05.101 --> 27:07.538
Tucson. I think that's where
Eme and Nimla's mother is.

27:07.582 --> 27:08.714
Run it down for me.

27:08.757 --> 27:11.412
Eme remembers her
mother's first name, Ana.

27:11.455 --> 27:12.935
She remembers they lived
in a desert,

27:12.979 --> 27:15.242
and she's pretty sure her
grandmother's name was Rosalie.

27:15.285 --> 27:16.852
You check Arizona
state records?

27:16.896 --> 27:19.942
I found an Emeline Vazquez,
born in 2009.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.596
Mother's name is Ana Sanchez.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.556
No father's name listed, but
Ana's mother's name, Rosalie.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.080
It's not 100% match, but...

27:27.123 --> 27:29.735
I assume Tucson PD is rolling
on their last known address.

27:29.778 --> 27:30.910
Already put in
the request.

27:30.953 --> 27:32.215
I asked them to call
through your office

27:32.259 --> 27:33.564
in case we're
out in the field.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.262
I'll let you know as soon
as I hear from 'em.

27:35.305 --> 27:38.047
Uh, sir, could we, uh,
could we talk for a minute

27:38.091 --> 27:39.266
about something personal?

27:39.309 --> 27:41.268
Uh, maybe later.

27:41.311 --> 27:44.619
Commander.
Oscar at Respirar called.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.752
Heard that we saved Ricky,
so he decided he can trust us.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.057
He gave me a few addresses

27:48.101 --> 27:49.276
where the activists might
be hiding out.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.451
How many locations
we got to check?

27:50.494 --> 27:52.061
Three. Team's getting ready now.

27:52.105 --> 27:54.063
All right, check 'em all.
Off you go.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.198
[music playing in Spanish]We know how many people
may be inside?

27:58.241 --> 28:00.026
Oscar said these houses are
crash pads with an open-door

28:00.069 --> 28:02.463
policy for immigrants who
want to lay low for a while.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.900
No way to tell
who might be here.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.515
LAPD!

28:11.559 --> 28:13.169
[speaking Spanish]

28:16.782 --> 28:18.871
[continues in Spanish]

28:21.743 --> 28:23.136
[speaking Spanish]

28:24.659 --> 28:25.747
LUCA:
Deac, I got a hit on that burner

28:25.791 --> 28:27.575
that Angela bought Carlos.

28:27.618 --> 28:30.143
It pinged off towers
near the house you're at.Roger that.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.362
[Chris speaks Spanish]

28:33.494 --> 28:34.364
[clattering]

28:35.801 --> 28:36.845
Chris. Got movement
in the alley.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.721
LAPD! Stop.

28:43.591 --> 28:46.463
24-David, we're in
foot pursuit, west side alley.

28:46.507 --> 28:48.248
Two subjects in hoodies.

28:52.905 --> 28:55.255
LAPD.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.170
Show me your hands.

28:57.213 --> 28:59.999
Turn around.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.043
CHRIS:
Put your hoodie down.

29:06.222 --> 29:08.224
It's them, from the photos.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.271
30-David, we're Code 4.

29:11.314 --> 29:12.751
Two of our activists
secured.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.013
You can put your hands down.

29:14.056 --> 29:17.277
Edwin, Marta, we're LAPD SWAT.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.322
Your friend Ricky is back
at our station,

29:19.366 --> 29:20.541
and we're here
to get you to safety.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.282
CHRIS:
There's three of you, right?

29:22.325 --> 29:23.283
Where's your other friend?

29:23.326 --> 29:26.025
You mean Carlos? He...

29:26.068 --> 29:27.722
He figured out who
betrayed Angela.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.072
He left to get revenge.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.684
Hondo, we got a problem.

29:33.728 --> 29:36.644
Garrett's not answering
his phone.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.298
Maybe he realized
they're on to him.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.213
Nobody's picking up
at the magazine, either.

29:40.256 --> 29:41.823
Dude lied to my face.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.738
Said he didn't know what
Angela was working on.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.001
According to Edwin and Marta,
Angela submitted her story

29:46.045 --> 29:47.655
two days ago.

29:47.698 --> 29:49.831
Instead of publishing it,
Garrett must've called someone

29:49.875 --> 29:51.441
in the Guatemalan government
and tipped them off.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.922
I don't get it. I mean, Angela
was one of his best journalists.

29:53.966 --> 29:57.230
Why dime her out?For the money, most likely.

29:57.273 --> 29:58.709
According to the magazine owner,
Garrett was

29:58.753 --> 30:00.146
suspended a few years back.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.017
Gambling problem forced
an intervention.

30:02.061 --> 30:04.454
They think he relapsed?Possible.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.892
Magazine recently had to pull
three stories before publication

30:06.935 --> 30:09.851
'cause the subjects involved
got a heads-up,

30:09.895 --> 30:11.157
threatened to sue.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.333
Someone on the inside
had to tip 'em off.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.813
Sounds like a straight-up
blackmail scheme.

30:14.856 --> 30:17.163
Pay, I kill the story.
Don't pay, we publish.

30:17.206 --> 30:18.642
It's one way
to cover your debts.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.296
Except whoever Garrett
called this time didn't just

30:20.340 --> 30:22.037
want the story killed;
they wanted all the witnesses

30:22.081 --> 30:23.169
erased as well.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.518
We'll worry
about who that is later.

30:24.561 --> 30:26.259
Right now, we need to find
Carlos and Garrett.

30:26.302 --> 30:27.826
Yes, sir.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.527
I don't care
how much you paid me.

30:33.570 --> 30:35.616
The police are all over this.

30:35.659 --> 30:37.096
No, I need to get
out of the country now, okay?

30:37.139 --> 30:38.445
You need to help me.

30:38.488 --> 30:40.490
[siren wailing,
tires screeching]

30:53.547 --> 30:55.331
Security guard at the office
said that Garrett left

30:55.375 --> 30:57.203
a few minutes ago.
Doesn't think he pulled out yet.

30:57.246 --> 30:59.596
Luca, you got a layout for us?

30:59.640 --> 31:00.815
Stairwell by the elevator has

31:00.859 --> 31:02.164
open sight lines
from the landing

31:02.208 --> 31:04.036
on every level.Copy. We're on the move.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.828
Hit level six. Garrett's space
is number 630.Got it.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.186
[alarm chirps]

31:30.018 --> 31:31.367
You're one of them?

31:31.411 --> 31:35.937
One of the people you sold out,
you mean? Yes, I am.

31:35.981 --> 31:39.506
No one was supposed
to get hurt. I-I swear.

31:39.549 --> 31:44.119
No. Angela trusted you
with everything.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.209
Don't look at me.

31:47.253 --> 31:50.517
All she wanted was
to tell the world our story.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.345
And, for that,
you got her killed.

31:52.388 --> 31:55.478
GARRETT:
I-I had no idea
that they were gonna hurt her.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.132
Please believe me.

31:57.176 --> 31:58.351
Carlos!

31:58.394 --> 31:59.874
This is the LAPD.

31:59.918 --> 32:00.919
Put that gun down now.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.399
I'm not gonna let you shoot him.
Put it down.

32:03.443 --> 32:05.488
HONDO:
Come on, man.

32:06.359 --> 32:07.751
We've got
your friends.

32:07.795 --> 32:09.884
They're all safe.
It's over.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.455
Garrett called backup.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.017
Deac, let's throw some smoke

32:56.061 --> 32:57.236
so you can get to Carlos
and Garrett.

32:57.279 --> 32:58.454
I'll edge around
and get a better angle

32:58.498 --> 33:00.239
on the second shooter.Roger that.

33:07.811 --> 33:10.423
I'll cover you. Go.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.556
[gunfire continues]

33:13.600 --> 33:15.428
Don't do it, Carlos!

33:18.431 --> 33:19.432
30-David.

33:19.475 --> 33:20.650
Garrett and Carlos are secure.

33:22.217 --> 33:24.654
[gunfire]

33:31.835 --> 33:33.011
[groans]

33:41.889 --> 33:43.456
This is 20-David.

33:43.499 --> 33:46.024
We're Code 4.
Suspects in custody.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.938
I need two R/As at my location.

33:47.982 --> 33:50.985
LUCA:
Copy that, 20-David.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.118
And we just confirmed
that Garrett's last call

33:53.161 --> 33:54.510
was to a legal office
that works

33:54.554 --> 33:56.295
with several
Guatemalan officials.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.297
But they're denying
any knowledge of Garrett

33:58.340 --> 34:00.081
or about Angela's murder.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.475
So we can't I.D. the person who
hired Ramiro and his cronies?

34:02.518 --> 34:04.129
No, not unless someone talks.

34:04.172 --> 34:05.826
For now, Garrett, Ramiro,
the others

34:05.869 --> 34:07.654
are staying pretty tight-lipped.

34:07.697 --> 34:09.177
I guess they're more afraid
of whoever ordered the hits

34:09.221 --> 34:10.744
than the American
justice system.

34:10.787 --> 34:12.180
At some point,
Garrett's gonna realize

34:12.224 --> 34:13.921
that those shooters
were firing at him, too.

34:13.964 --> 34:17.142
Maybe he's gonna
rethink his loyalties.

34:17.185 --> 34:19.535
By the way,
Oscar at Respirar,

34:19.579 --> 34:21.537
he came through again.

34:21.581 --> 34:23.235
He lined up a great
immigration lawyer

34:23.278 --> 34:25.672
to help our activist friends
file for political asylum.

34:25.715 --> 34:27.152
I'll take that as a win.

34:27.195 --> 34:30.155
Hey. We celebrating?
'Cause I have good news.

34:30.198 --> 34:31.939
Let me guess. You're
the "Most Special"

34:31.982 --> 34:34.246
Special Tactics and
Training Liaison now?

34:34.289 --> 34:35.334
Trust me,
you guys will get tired of that

34:35.377 --> 34:36.552
way before I do.

34:36.596 --> 34:37.988
What's your good news?

34:38.032 --> 34:39.294
I just heard from the Times.

34:39.338 --> 34:40.991
Carlos pulled Angela's article

34:41.035 --> 34:42.471
off Garrett's phone.

34:42.515 --> 34:45.300
It showed up in the paper's
inbox. Runs tomorrow.

34:45.344 --> 34:47.737
That's a great tribute
to Angela.

34:47.781 --> 34:50.262
It's her last story,
but maybe it'll do some good

34:50.305 --> 34:51.393
for the people
she was trying to help.

34:51.437 --> 34:53.352
Amen, brother.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.702
Hi, Mom.
Hi.

34:55.745 --> 34:57.399
You're both so grown up.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.488
EME:
I missed you
so much, mamá.

34:59.532 --> 35:03.144
ANA:
I miss you more.
I dreamed of you every night.

35:03.188 --> 35:05.712
Mamá,how soon are you coming?

35:05.755 --> 35:07.583
ANA:
I will be there soon, I promise.

35:07.627 --> 35:10.064
It's so good to see you.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.284
I can't wait to hold you.You have a nice evening.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.068
It's really her?

35:14.112 --> 35:16.897
I spoke with the chief
in Tucson.

35:16.940 --> 35:19.073
He said the second Ana heard
that her kids were alive,

35:19.117 --> 35:20.379
she broke down crying.

35:20.422 --> 35:23.164
Did they say how she got
separated from them?

35:23.208 --> 35:24.861
Ramiro grabbed the girls
from day care,

35:24.905 --> 35:27.690
told their mother he'd kill 'em
if she tried to get 'em back.

35:27.734 --> 35:31.999
And after years of Ramiro's
abuse, she believed him.

35:32.042 --> 35:34.393
For a mom who loves her kids,
I can't imagine anything worse.

35:34.436 --> 35:37.657
Yeah. DCFS is taking the girls

35:37.700 --> 35:39.224
to temporary placement.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.314
Ana's on the first flight
to L.A. tomorrow.

35:42.357 --> 35:44.098
And I'm going home.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.926
Actually, Commander, uh,

35:45.969 --> 35:49.103
I felt I should
say something.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.235
About Molly and I.

35:50.278 --> 35:51.497
Are you referring
to the fact

35:51.540 --> 35:53.107
that you broke up
with my daughter?

35:53.151 --> 35:55.109
Yeah, I'm up to speed.

35:55.153 --> 35:59.113
Sir, you have to know I...
I think the world of Molly.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.203
Yeah. She told me.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.465
She did?

36:05.467 --> 36:09.732
Look, my daughter's hurting.

36:09.776 --> 36:14.128
So are you my favorite person
right now? No.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.564
But Molly said
you didn't play games

36:15.608 --> 36:17.610
and you treated her
with some respect.

36:17.653 --> 36:19.438
I do respect her.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.570
Trust me, I was the
problem, not her.

36:21.614 --> 36:25.183
Oh, I have no doubt
that's the case.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.454
[Ana speaking indistinctly]

36:35.497 --> 36:37.978
EME: Mamá,
I can't
wait to see you.

36:38.021 --> 36:40.198
ANA:
I'm gonna be there soon,
I promise.

36:40.241 --> 36:42.591
I will never leave
your side again.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.032
Sup, man?

37:12.882 --> 37:14.449
Hello. Yeah, um...

37:14.493 --> 37:16.321
I-I'd like to check up
on a patient, please.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.453
Her name is Street.
Karen Street.

37:39.692 --> 37:42.129
So, you still here?

37:42.172 --> 37:43.522
DANIEL:
I got your message.

37:43.565 --> 37:45.219
Is this face-to-face enough
for you?

37:45.263 --> 37:47.265
Thought you might be
long gone by now.

37:47.308 --> 37:49.484
That was the plan.
Plan changed.

37:51.965 --> 37:54.881
You were really
gonna do it, huh?

37:54.924 --> 37:56.709
Just blow out of town
like the last couple years

37:56.752 --> 37:58.276
never happened.

37:58.319 --> 38:01.191
After we fought like hell to put
this family back together.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.019
That's exactly what
I was gonna do.

38:03.063 --> 38:05.065
Pop, I convinced Winnie
and Mama to count on you,

38:05.108 --> 38:09.374
despite my hurt over you
walking out on us back then.

38:09.417 --> 38:10.853
So, what?

38:10.897 --> 38:14.379
What, did it get
too real for you?

38:14.422 --> 38:16.119
What, you get scared
all of a sudden?

38:17.904 --> 38:20.341
You think running off again
is the solution?

38:20.385 --> 38:22.648
I am scared,

38:22.691 --> 38:26.565
but not that I can't carry
the weight of this family.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.784
But that I've become
a weight on this family.

38:31.918 --> 38:33.398
Look, son.

38:33.441 --> 38:35.791
I started feeling bad
about a month or so ago.

38:36.923 --> 38:38.925
Tired,

38:38.968 --> 38:41.928
no appetite and a back pain
that wouldn't quit.

38:41.971 --> 38:44.060
I thought the radiation
was helping.

38:44.104 --> 38:45.758
I was feeling better
until I wasn't.

38:45.801 --> 38:46.802
What'd the doctor say?

38:46.846 --> 38:50.328
She said we need
to run some tests.

38:50.371 --> 38:53.766
Said it could be nothing.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.420
Could be that the treatment
stopped working

38:55.463 --> 38:57.596
and my cancer's growing back.

38:57.639 --> 38:58.814
Pop, we've been through this.

38:58.858 --> 39:00.642
You holding back
isn't helping anything.

39:00.686 --> 39:01.904
You should've told me.

39:01.948 --> 39:03.471
What am I supposed to do?

39:03.515 --> 39:05.778
Come to you for everything?

39:05.821 --> 39:07.214
You forget, I'm the one
that's supposed to be

39:07.257 --> 39:10.304
looking out for you,
not the other way around.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.958
So I handled my business.

39:12.001 --> 39:14.787
Packing your bags and running
away ain't handling anything.

39:14.830 --> 39:20.053
If the radiation failed, son,
you know what comes next?

39:20.096 --> 39:22.621
Me getting sicker,

39:22.664 --> 39:26.407
your mama becoming
a resentful nursemaid,

39:26.451 --> 39:28.235
and my kids
watching me fade away.

39:28.278 --> 39:29.628
And I don't need none of that.

39:29.671 --> 39:32.326
It ain't just about
what you want anymore.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.023
Don't you think I know that?

39:34.067 --> 39:37.723
Why you think I'm sitting here,
scared to call these doctors?

39:39.507 --> 39:42.031
My test results are back.

39:42.075 --> 39:46.514
And I got a feeling in my heart

39:46.558 --> 39:48.386
I ain't gonna like
what they say.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.260
You brought me back.

39:55.828 --> 39:58.961
You opened my world.

39:59.005 --> 40:01.703
Had your mama back. Winnie.

40:01.747 --> 40:03.923
Darryl.

40:03.966 --> 40:06.012
Having that boy is...

40:06.055 --> 40:09.363
it's like having
a second chance with you.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.539
Then why leave?

40:11.583 --> 40:14.194
Right when we can
help you the most?

40:14.237 --> 40:18.546
Because if I leave,
you can hate me,

40:18.590 --> 40:20.809
instead of me
breaking your hearts again.

40:24.465 --> 40:26.380
You listen here.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.513
Ain't no world
where you disappear

40:28.556 --> 40:30.776
and hearts don't get broken.

40:30.819 --> 40:33.605
You are my father

40:33.648 --> 40:36.303
and you are part
of this family again.

40:36.346 --> 40:38.914
You don't need
to spare us nothing.

40:38.958 --> 40:40.960
I can't see myself
being a burden.

40:41.003 --> 40:44.485
Love is never a burden, Pop.

40:44.529 --> 40:47.967
I need you to hear that
and I need you to trust that.

40:50.839 --> 40:52.972
Damn.

40:53.015 --> 40:56.541
All this family stuff
would've been so much easier

40:56.584 --> 41:00.414
if it came with a-an instruction
manual from the jump.

41:04.287 --> 41:06.725
What about those test results?

41:06.768 --> 41:08.335
Maybe it's good news.

41:08.378 --> 41:10.293
And if it isn't?

41:11.947 --> 41:14.950
Then we will know what
