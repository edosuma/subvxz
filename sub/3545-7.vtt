00:00.208 --> 00:04.000
<i>- Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.
- What is it you hired me to do?

00:04.083 --> 00:06.500
That was sent to my wife.
I need to know who.

00:06.625 --> 00:08.458
<i>Some secrets were discovered.</i>

00:08.542 --> 00:11.625
After Mom died, I started
remembering about Dana.

00:11.709 --> 00:13.250
- Dana?
- What are you doing?

00:13.333 --> 00:15.000
<i>Some secrets were uncovered.</i>

00:15.083 --> 00:17.333
She could be having
an affair with anyone.

00:17.417 --> 00:20.041
Don't worry.
I'm not letting her out of my sight.

00:20.125 --> 00:24.083
<i>- And some secrets...</i>
- Jordana Geist gets her work done.

00:24.208 --> 00:26.458
- How do you cram it all in?
<i>- ...were shared.</i>

00:26.542 --> 00:28.709
That's ADD medication.

00:36.417 --> 00:40.375
<i>Competition. It means different things</i>
<i>to different people.</i>

00:40.458 --> 00:44.208
<i>In suburbia,</i>
<i>it means keeping up with the Joneses.</i>

00:44.291 --> 00:49.625
<i>On Wisteria Lane, that means</i>
<i>keeping up with Bree Van De Kamp.</i>

00:49.709 --> 00:53.834
<i>Everyone knew Bree had</i>
<i>the nicest lawn in the neighborhood.</i>

00:53.917 --> 00:55.834
<i>And no one begrudged her this.</i>

00:55.959 --> 01:00.834
<i>No one, that is, except Martha Huber,</i>

01:00.959 --> 01:04.875
<i>whose own lawn paled in comparison.</i>

01:04.959 --> 01:08.291
<i>No matter how carefully she trimmed,</i>

01:08.375 --> 01:11.417
<i>or how lovingly she watered...</i>

01:12.792 --> 01:16.709
<i>or how generously she fertilized,</i>

01:16.792 --> 01:22.125
<i>the grass was always greener</i>
<i>on the other side of the fence.</i>

01:26.458 --> 01:29.250
Hello, Victor. How are you today?

01:29.333 --> 01:32.709
- Out jogging again?
- I can't catch my breath.

01:32.834 --> 01:36.250
Would you like a slurp from my hose?

01:42.041 --> 01:43.959
Victor?

01:46.375 --> 01:49.917
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get an ambulance.

01:52.375 --> 01:58.834
<i>Then one day, Mrs. Huber finally got</i>
<i>the chance to mow down the competition.</i>

02:13.041 --> 02:15.667
Help! Somebody help!

02:19.792 --> 02:20.792
What happened?

02:20.875 --> 02:24.500
He collapsed on your hydrangeas.
Call 911!

02:39.875 --> 02:45.250
<i>Yes, Mrs. Huber understood</i>
<i>the first rule of competition:</i>

02:45.417 --> 02:50.166
<i>In order to win,</i>
<i>you have to want it more.</i>

03:32.709 --> 03:36.291
<i>When I was alive, my friends and I</i>
<i>came together once a month</i>

03:36.417 --> 03:39.291
<i>for a meeting</i>
<i>of the Wisteria Lane Book Club.</i>

03:39.375 --> 03:43.542
<i>We found the problems</i>
<i>of literary characters so absorbing.</i>

03:44.875 --> 03:47.417
<i>The way they dealt with adversity,</i>

03:47.500 --> 03:51.166
<i>conducted illicit affairs,</i>

03:51.291 --> 03:54.041
<i>endured domestic dramas,</i>

03:55.208 --> 03:58.000
<i>and planned romantic conquests.</i>

03:58.083 --> 04:03.458
<i>But since my death, my friends</i>
<i>had lost their interest in fiction.</i>

04:05.166 --> 04:07.291
So, what did everybody think?

04:07.417 --> 04:10.417
<i>Their own problems</i>
<i>had become absorbing enough.</i>

04:10.500 --> 04:14.333
I thought the character
of Madame Bovary was very inspirational.

04:15.500 --> 04:19.625
Inspirational?
She poisons herself with arsenic.

04:19.709 --> 04:22.959
- Really?
- You didn't read until the end?

04:23.041 --> 04:25.917
I stopped after page 50.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.500
- Am I the only one who read the book?
- I saw the movie. It was good.

04:29.583 --> 04:34.000
Ladies, I'm sorry, but
what is the point of having a book club

04:34.083 --> 04:35.917
if we don't read the book?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.583
- More wine?
- Always.

04:38.667 --> 04:44.709
Sue, Reba, Emma and Lori, would you
girls come and help me with the snacks?

04:44.792 --> 04:46.792
Sure.

04:47.959 --> 04:51.709
I will be right in.

04:51.834 --> 04:55.000
God, I couldn't wait to get rid of them!

04:55.125 --> 04:57.792
OK, so Lynette said
that you found Zach.

04:57.875 --> 05:01.750
He's at a rehabilitation center.
Julie snuck in and talked to him.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.917
He mentioned his mother's suicide?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.041
There wasn't time.
He did say something mysterious.

05:07.125 --> 05:09.875
He said something happened
to someone named Dana

05:10.000 --> 05:12.041
and that he could never talk about it.

05:12.125 --> 05:14.041
- Who's Dana?
- That's the mystery.

05:14.166 --> 05:18.041
Dana must have something to do
with what Mary Alice was trying to hide.

05:18.166 --> 05:20.458
Somebody found out her secret...

05:20.542 --> 05:24.208
- And sent the note.
- So who the hell is that?

05:27.291 --> 05:30.709
Stationery is Parcher No.17.
100% cotton.

05:30.792 --> 05:33.583
It's made by Cyprus Office Products.

05:33.709 --> 05:36.875
They have stores in 12 cities,
including yours.

05:36.959 --> 05:39.834
The postmark
is from your local post office.

05:39.959 --> 05:42.125
Meaning?

05:42.208 --> 05:44.917
The blackmailer's probably
someone you know.

05:45.041 --> 05:49.917
A neighbor, milkman,
pool boy, soccer mom.

05:50.041 --> 05:52.625
Soccer mom?

05:52.750 --> 05:55.834
Mr. Young,
sometimes evil drives a minivan.

05:57.417 --> 05:58.667
I had this gig once,

05:58.750 --> 06:02.583
checking on this P.T.A. mom who was
hell-bent on landing her daughter

06:02.667 --> 06:05.709
a spot on the parade float.

06:05.792 --> 06:09.667
She fed antifreeze
to half the homecoming committee.

06:11.583 --> 06:15.667
- Did you catch her?
- Mr. Young...

06:17.125 --> 06:20.625
The people who hired me
didn't hire me to catch her.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.792
Wow, honey!
This place looks spotless.

06:29.917 --> 06:31.417
Thanks.

06:31.500 --> 06:37.125
So I have come up with this killer idea
for the Spotless Scrub campaign.

06:37.250 --> 06:40.917
- Great. Want to run it by me?
- No. I'm good.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.959
- But thanks.
- OK.

06:44.041 --> 06:49.000
You know how whenever I pitch
Hennessey always tears my ideas down?

06:49.083 --> 06:53.792
I invited the partners and their wives
over so I could pitch to them here.

06:53.875 --> 06:56.834
I thought we could make
a formal dinner for six...

06:56.959 --> 06:59.458
When exactly would this take place?

06:59.542 --> 07:02.333
- The day after tomorrow.
- Tom!

07:02.458 --> 07:04.750
- I know it's short notice.
- You think?

07:04.834 --> 07:07.625
How can I pull off a formal dinner
with no warning?

07:07.709 --> 07:10.959
Bree Van De Kamp
does this kind of thing all the time.

07:12.083 --> 07:15.917
- What did you say?
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.417
Forget it. I'll call and cancel.
Just don't worry about it.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.375
No, let's do it.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.000
Really?

07:26.125 --> 07:29.834
Yeah. It's good for your career.
I'll pull it off.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.667
Yes! Honey, thank you.

07:32.750 --> 07:37.458
I promise, I land this account and I am
gonna buy you something awful pretty.

07:40.083 --> 07:45.291
<i>Luckily for Tom,</i>
<i>Lynette had a recipe for success.</i>

07:52.709 --> 07:57.583
<i>Unfortunately for her,</i>
<i>she was missing the secret ingredient.</i>

08:11.375 --> 08:13.208
- Yeah.
<i>- It's me.</i>

08:13.333 --> 08:15.458
Don't! My mother-in-law can see you.

08:15.542 --> 08:19.333
- I hate that she's watching us.
- Meet me at the motel in an hour.

08:23.333 --> 08:26.333
- I've got plans.
- So cancel.

08:26.417 --> 08:30.000
They're with Danielle.
We're going to the movies.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.959
- That sounds like a date.
- Yeah.

08:33.041 --> 08:35.709
I have a problem
with you seeing other girls.

08:35.792 --> 08:41.125
I have a problem with you having a
husband. We both have to learn to deal.

09:04.583 --> 09:08.542
Don't even try to make it up to me
by talking dirty.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.875
Hello?

09:29.458 --> 09:32.500
Mr. and Mrs. Van De Kamp.

09:32.625 --> 09:36.208
So, your son decided to entertain
some of his friends yesterday

09:36.291 --> 09:38.709
by shoving a freshman's head
into a locker.

09:38.792 --> 09:41.792
- The Johnson boy?
- Yes. He broke the boy's nose.

09:41.875 --> 09:45.000
Because of our no tolerance policy,
he faces expulsion.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.750
You'd ruin his future
over roughhousing?

09:47.834 --> 09:50.125
Rex, this was practically assault.

09:50.250 --> 09:53.250
Mrs. Stark,
what Andrew did was clearly wrong.

09:53.333 --> 09:56.875
But his mother and I are going
through severe marital problems.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
- Is that relevant?
- Our marriage is disintegrating.

10:00.125 --> 10:02.792
Of course Andrew is acting out.
He's angry.

10:02.875 --> 10:07.125
If he's angry about you moving out,
he should shove your head into a locker.

10:07.208 --> 10:11.041
All I'm saying is we need to take
some of the responsibility here.

10:11.125 --> 10:14.208
So does Andrew.
Blaming his actions on our problems,

10:14.291 --> 10:16.625
which are not serious,
does not help him.

10:16.709 --> 10:20.875
- Our problems are serious.
- Handle this however you see fit.

10:20.959 --> 10:23.041
Bree, I've gone to an attorney.

10:23.125 --> 10:26.750
You're gonna be served
with divorce papers later today.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.291
- You went to an attorney?
- Yeah.

10:29.375 --> 10:32.458
And a good one, too.

10:32.542 --> 10:36.709
He'd better be, 'cause when I'm finished
with you, you won't have a cent.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.792
Bring it on.

10:39.875 --> 10:42.750
Perhaps detention is the way to go.

10:42.834 --> 10:45.041
Mom, you're getting too dressed up.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.792
I know, but I wanna look really sexy.

10:47.875 --> 10:51.041
I told Mike I expect him
to have you home by 11.00.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.542
- Midnight?
- All right, but no later.

10:53.625 --> 10:57.333
You know how I worry.
So, you got protection?

10:57.417 --> 11:01.542
Oh, my God!
We are so not having this conversation.

11:01.625 --> 11:04.625
We are, because I enjoy
being an only child.

11:04.709 --> 11:07.875
- Are you finished?
- Almost.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.917
I always assumed I'd have sex for
the first time before you had it again.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.417
OK, you can leave now.

11:18.583 --> 11:21.417
What do you think? Trying too hard?

11:21.500 --> 11:25.667
What do you know? It's 80 degrees
outside and you're wearing fur.

11:35.583 --> 11:38.417
Hiya, Mike.

11:52.125 --> 11:54.375
Hey, Edie.

11:56.458 --> 11:59.792
Get a load of you!
You look so pretty!

11:59.917 --> 12:03.417
- I hardly recognize you.
- This?

12:03.500 --> 12:07.750
Well, I have a date.
Right now. With Mike.

12:08.875 --> 12:12.542
We kissed, FYI.

12:21.792 --> 12:24.041
Love that jacket. Good choice.

12:24.125 --> 12:27.834
Susan, I am really sorry,
but I've got to cancel.

12:27.917 --> 12:32.417
I have an unexpected house guest.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.417
Coming through. Ooh, sorry.
Hi. I'm Kendra.

12:35.500 --> 12:39.667
- Susan.
- I'm gonna get my stuff.

12:43.917 --> 12:47.000
I know how this looks,
but there's nothing between us.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.834
- Kendra's just an old friend.
- Old friend.

12:49.917 --> 12:52.667
- Yeah, you know...
- Yeah.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.625
No, actually, no, I don't know.

12:54.709 --> 12:58.792
By old friend you mean college pal?
Saved you from drowning?

12:58.875 --> 13:02.208
- It's hard to explain.
- Could you give it a shot?

13:04.041 --> 13:08.041
Mike, I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.959
Look, I promise
I'll make this up to you.

13:14.041 --> 13:21.000
- And you look amazing.
- Mike! Where are the towels?

13:24.500 --> 13:25.792
Thanks.

13:30.750 --> 13:33.667
Hey. How was your big date?

13:34.750 --> 13:36.792
Mike had to reschedule.

13:36.875 --> 13:39.208
Oh. Because of the hot girl?

13:39.333 --> 13:42.291
With the suitcase? Over there?

13:43.166 --> 13:46.875
Gosh, how devastating for you...FYI.

13:55.583 --> 13:59.166
I just want to move this place fast.
I'll do whatever we have to do.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.250
That's good to know.

14:01.375 --> 14:05.458
You'll have to disclose the fact that
your wife killed herself in the house.

14:05.583 --> 14:09.417
- I will?
- Yeah. Legal crap.

14:09.542 --> 14:12.792
People get really freaked out
by suicides.

14:12.917 --> 14:16.917
You can't blame them. Hell.
I get the willies just standing here.

14:17.959 --> 14:20.834
- Is there any way to get around it?
- Off the record?

14:20.917 --> 14:23.083
Yeah.

14:23.208 --> 14:26.291
You could say that she shot herself
in the living room

14:26.375 --> 14:28.709
and then crawled out back to die.

14:30.250 --> 14:32.500
I'm just saying.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.417
I gotta go. I'll call you tomorrow.

14:42.917 --> 14:45.125
Edie, wait!

14:54.208 --> 14:56.291
<i>Paul had always known</i>

14:56.375 --> 15:00.250
<i>Edie Britt was capable</i>
<i>of doing anything to close a deal.</i>

15:02.709 --> 15:07.583
<i>But now he realized</i>
<i>she was capable of so much more.</i>

15:10.083 --> 15:12.667
- Hey, Danielle.
- Hey, Mrs. Solis.

15:14.542 --> 15:19.250
Danielle, remember when you said
you wanted to be a model?

15:19.333 --> 15:21.458
You remember? That was last summer.

15:21.542 --> 15:25.375
Perchik Modeling Academy has
an opening for their summer program.

15:25.500 --> 15:29.917
- Would you like me to sponsor you?
- That's one of the best schools.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.250
- You would do that for me?
- I sure would.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.417
I would so love to go to New York.

15:34.542 --> 15:38.333
And I would so love
to help you get there.

15:46.542 --> 15:49.458
- Hey, Jordana.
- Hey, Lynette. How are you?

15:51.166 --> 15:53.875
You look a little tired.
Is everything OK?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.250
I'm getting ready for
a dinner party tomorrow. Six people.

15:57.375 --> 15:59.583
- Sounds fun.
- Big fun.

15:59.709 --> 16:03.375
You wouldn't have any of your kids'
ADD medication you could spare,

16:03.458 --> 16:08.417
- just to get me over the hump?
- Tina! Don't push your sister.

16:09.542 --> 16:13.166
Gosh, Lynette...
I'm really running low.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.375
I need all my energy I can get.

16:15.458 --> 16:19.166
My sister Elaine and her kids
are flying into town for a week.

16:19.250 --> 16:22.875
That's exciting.
I wish my sister would visit more often.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.417
Yeah, sisters are great.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.834
Three or four pills.
I'm hitting the wall.

16:27.917 --> 16:32.208
Yeah, the comedown can be a real bitch.
I wish I could help.

16:34.834 --> 16:38.583
- I'm not gonna forget about this.
- What's that supposed to mean?

16:38.709 --> 16:42.083
Come Girl Scout cookie time,
don't bring around little Tina

16:42.208 --> 16:44.250
because we won't be home.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.250
What's all this about?

16:53.291 --> 16:56.333
You know your mother and I
have been unhappy for a while.

16:56.417 --> 17:00.667
We've decided that it would be better
if we got divorced.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.083
But whatever problems we have,

17:03.166 --> 17:06.417
it doesn't change the fact
that we love you very, very much.

17:07.250 --> 17:10.667
- I've got a question.
- Go ahead. Ask whatever you want.

17:10.792 --> 17:13.750
Can I live with Dad?

17:13.834 --> 17:16.917
Come on, Mom, let's face it.
We drive each other crazy.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.375
Danielle, would you prefer
to live with your father?

17:27.458 --> 17:30.458
I don't really care,
as long as I have my own bathroom.

17:36.125 --> 17:40.250
All this wine is giving me a headache.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.458
Six weeks in the suburban jungle,
and this is all you got?

17:57.583 --> 18:00.417
There are over 300 families
in this subdivision.

18:00.542 --> 18:02.667
It'll take time to check 'em all out.

18:02.750 --> 18:06.792
- Dad said you were ready to quit.
- I changed my mind.

18:06.875 --> 18:10.709
This is a gigantic waste
of your time and my father's money.

18:10.834 --> 18:13.792
Are you afraid
he'll spend your inheritance?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.750
That's not funny.

18:15.834 --> 18:19.291
- Mike, here's the thing.
- What?

18:20.291 --> 18:22.166
Dad can't chase ghosts alone.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.792
If you stop,
he'll have to accept it's over.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.375
Let me have my father back.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.667
If I quit he'll just hire somebody else.

18:29.750 --> 18:33.500
Not if you tell him
there's nothing here to find.

18:33.583 --> 18:36.375
I can't do that.

18:39.834 --> 18:42.291
What happens when
your girlfriend finds out

18:42.375 --> 18:45.709
you're not just the sweet,
neighborly plumber?

18:49.500 --> 18:52.000
You're lying to her, Mike.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.291
Here it is.

18:59.375 --> 19:02.083
Great.
This'll keep the crab dip warm.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.792
It took forever
to shell the little buggers.

19:04.917 --> 19:07.667
You shelled your own crabs?

19:07.750 --> 19:10.709
Are you doing too much?
'cause you look exhausted.

19:10.834 --> 19:15.208
I'm fine. I just need some coffee.
Thank you.

19:16.792 --> 19:19.917
Oh, my God! Look at this embroidery!

19:21.875 --> 19:25.792
"Dana." Where did this come from?

19:25.917 --> 19:28.125
Paul Young's garage sale.

19:32.875 --> 19:34.500
Dana.

19:37.583 --> 19:40.083
Dana was a baby.

19:47.125 --> 19:49.125
Surprise.

19:49.250 --> 19:53.583
- No way!
- It's all yours. Here are the keys.

19:53.667 --> 19:57.458
- Rex, what's this about?
- I went and splurged a little.

19:57.583 --> 20:00.959
Danielle, here's your present.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.500
- Luggage?
- Yeah.

20:02.583 --> 20:06.208
To take to the Perchik Modeling
Academy. I'm footing the bill.

20:06.291 --> 20:08.875
- I can go to New York?
- Wait a minute.

20:08.959 --> 20:13.125
- What's this about a modeling academy?
- Mrs. Solis is sponsoring me.

20:13.208 --> 20:15.333
When were you planning on telling me?

20:15.458 --> 20:17.291
I think it's a great idea.

20:17.375 --> 20:21.625
Don't you two see when he's doing?
He's trying to buy your love.

20:21.709 --> 20:23.917
For God's sake. Don't be paranoid.

20:24.041 --> 20:26.166
A car? A modeling academy?

20:26.250 --> 20:30.583
You should have discussed these gifts
with me first. We cannot accept them.

20:31.625 --> 20:33.041
You can't let her do this.

20:33.125 --> 20:35.875
We just told the kids
we're getting divorced.

20:35.959 --> 20:39.166
- It's time to spoil them a little.
- I said no.

20:39.250 --> 20:44.125
You know what? They're my kids too,
and I can give them anything I want.

20:45.291 --> 20:46.333
There you go.

20:46.458 --> 20:47.834
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Yes.

21:13.792 --> 21:17.083
Did you offer to help Danielle
get into modeling school?

21:17.166 --> 21:22.917
What? Yes... No.
Is that how she heard it?

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Yes. Gabrielle, did you
or did you not offer to sponsor her?

21:27.834 --> 21:30.750
- I just wanted to help out.
- It's in New York!

21:30.834 --> 21:32.750
Why would you suggest that?

21:33.917 --> 21:37.709
It's her dream.
Don't you want her to be happy?

21:37.792 --> 21:42.041
No. And I would appreciate you keeping
your ridiculous ideas to yourself.

21:44.083 --> 21:45.875
Bree!

21:52.834 --> 21:55.000
John.

21:57.041 --> 22:00.125
You're so jealous of Danielle
you tried to ship her off?

22:00.208 --> 22:03.333
I'm not jealous.
I just don't like to share.

22:03.417 --> 22:06.625
Well, you know what? I quit.
The yard. Us. Everything.

22:06.709 --> 22:08.792
Don't be that way.

22:08.875 --> 22:13.417
What's the point, if we can never
be together? An hour here and there.

22:13.542 --> 22:19.125
I don't want us to end on a bad note.
Carlos has this black tie thing...

22:19.250 --> 22:22.208
- Mrs. Solis!
- John, please.

22:23.542 --> 22:27.542
What we had was so special.

22:27.625 --> 22:31.291
I think it deserves a proper goodbye.

22:31.417 --> 22:34.166
We'd still be over, though.

22:34.250 --> 22:37.166
Of course.

22:49.875 --> 22:53.750
- I knew this was a good idea.
- Thank you for suggesting it.

22:53.834 --> 22:56.709
Your boys are the only ones
who could tire out Timmy.

22:59.125 --> 23:02.583
Yep, he's a feisty one.

23:02.667 --> 23:05.333
Word on the street is,
you medicate Timmy.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.792
Yeah. For his ADD.

23:07.875 --> 23:12.917
- The pills have been a godsend.
- I bet.

23:13.917 --> 23:16.458
Can I use your bathroom?

23:33.917 --> 23:39.125
<i>As Lynette swallowed the stolen</i>
<i>medication of an eight-year-old child,</i>

23:39.208 --> 23:42.667
<i>she vowed she'd never again</i>
<i>sink to such depths.</i>

23:47.166 --> 23:49.166
<i>Any time soon.</i>

23:58.875 --> 24:01.417
Looks like you've got your blackmailer.

24:02.625 --> 24:07.291
- Is it time to bring in the police?
- That's not really an option for me.

24:10.583 --> 24:15.208
Before my wife shot herself,
we lived a life that I was proud of.

24:15.291 --> 24:19.417
We loved each other.
We had values. We went to church.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.542
We gave to charity.
We were good people, Mr. Shaw.

24:22.625 --> 24:24.792
I believe you.

24:26.583 --> 24:31.375
That's why it's so incomprehensible
that Edie Britt would try to destroy us.

24:32.875 --> 24:34.917
Well, you've suffered a great loss.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.750
For your pain to heal,
that's gonna take some time.

24:39.625 --> 24:42.625
I can't wait.

24:42.709 --> 24:45.458
I need help now.

24:48.291 --> 24:52.750
For five grand she's hurt,
ten grand she's gone.

25:12.333 --> 25:15.000
- Mom, what's going on?
- I'm throwing you out.

25:15.083 --> 25:17.333
I've separated all your things.

25:17.417 --> 25:21.000
This side is yours, Danielle,
and the other one is Andrew's.

25:21.083 --> 25:24.667
- OK, you've lost it.
- Where are we supposed to live?

25:24.750 --> 25:29.875
I don't know. Everything in the north
quadrant of yours is clothes and books.

25:29.959 --> 25:32.625
The south side are miscellaneous items.

25:32.709 --> 25:35.583
Mom, this isn't gonna work.
I'm not giving up my car.

25:35.667 --> 25:38.917
That's smart. You'll probably
have to sleep in it for a while.

25:40.875 --> 25:43.458
You can't stop us
from going inside the house.

25:43.542 --> 25:48.709
No? That's Mr. Conlin, the locksmith.
He's been very helpful today.

25:48.792 --> 25:52.834
I could give you the new keys
if you'd adhere to my rules,

25:52.917 --> 25:56.959
which include
giving back your father's gifts.

26:02.250 --> 26:04.750
OK, fine. You win.
I won't go to New York.

26:09.750 --> 26:11.875
I'm outta here.

26:16.083 --> 26:20.083
Hello. Welcome. I'm Edie.
How do you do?

26:20.208 --> 26:23.417
An open house in the suburbs?
This is beyond kitsch.

26:23.500 --> 26:27.041
This is one of the houses
I've had a hard time getting into.

26:27.125 --> 26:29.500
God, I wish you would let this go.

26:29.583 --> 26:33.250
I'm taking you out tonight.
There's this cowboy bar you need to see.

26:33.333 --> 26:34.417
Why?

26:34.500 --> 26:37.583
It's the last place
anybody ever saw your sister.

26:41.291 --> 26:44.375
Susan. What brings you here?

26:44.458 --> 26:47.834
I just wanted to say goodbye
to Mary Alice's house

26:47.917 --> 26:50.750
before somebody else moved in.

26:50.834 --> 26:53.834
That sounds almost plausible.

26:53.917 --> 26:56.542
- I beg your pardon?
- Come on.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.125
We both know why you're here.

27:00.208 --> 27:04.792
And the answer is yes,
they are having sex. No question.

27:04.875 --> 27:08.583
- They're just friends.
- Think so?

27:08.667 --> 27:13.375
They're going to the Saddle Ranch
tonight for drinks and dancing.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.750
Friends can do that.

27:16.834 --> 27:20.542
Oh, my God,
I just want to slap and shake you.

27:26.041 --> 27:28.667
Where did you say
they were going tonight?

27:38.166 --> 27:40.417
Why did I let you
talk me into coming here?

27:40.500 --> 27:43.208
There is obviously
nothing going on between them.

27:43.333 --> 27:46.083
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom then home.

27:46.166 --> 27:49.208
- I don't want Mike to catch me.
- It's been ten minutes.

27:49.291 --> 27:51.959
She could be waiting
to make her move.

27:54.917 --> 27:58.208
You're not gonna beat a girl like that
by knocking off early.

27:58.333 --> 28:02.041
- It's not a competition.
- The hell it isn't.

28:02.125 --> 28:04.917
Good night, Edie.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.417
Suit yourself. But for the record,
I was rooting for you to land him.

28:10.542 --> 28:13.500
And why would you root for me?

28:13.583 --> 28:17.542
I figured it'd be easier for me
to steal Mike from you than her.

28:17.625 --> 28:20.458
She seems like fun.

28:23.208 --> 28:26.583
- Just take some antacid.
- It's not those kind of cramps.

28:26.667 --> 28:31.291
This is a business dinner.
It's important.

28:32.458 --> 28:38.000
Relax. You and I can go alone.
Gabrielle can stay here and get better.

28:40.041 --> 28:44.000
- Fine. See you in a couple of hours.
- OK.

28:45.125 --> 28:49.458
- Take good care of Carlos.
- I always do.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.125
Go, Edie!

29:11.500 --> 29:14.000
Oh, God.

29:22.417 --> 29:24.208
Mike!

29:24.291 --> 29:26.583
What a small, small world.

29:26.667 --> 29:29.750
Yeah, it sure is.
I caught Edie hiding in the back.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.583
No kidding. Is she here?

29:35.125 --> 29:40.083
Yeah. Yeah, she said, "The jig is up,"
and then she went to ride the bull.

29:40.166 --> 29:43.333
- And she said you two came together.
- Well, yeah.

29:43.417 --> 29:46.417
We did. I just thought she left.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.834
- Were you following me?
- What?

29:49.917 --> 29:53.709
No, I just came here,
you know, with Edie.

29:53.834 --> 29:56.875
We just love to ride that bull.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.959
- You? Ride the bull?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's a real rush.

30:01.041 --> 30:03.583
Come on, Susan. Give me a break.

30:03.709 --> 30:06.417
You give me a break.
I did not follow you here.

30:06.500 --> 30:10.083
Even if I did, it's because
you've been secretive about Kendra.

30:10.208 --> 30:13.333
- Kendra and I are friends.
- And I came here to ride the bull.

30:15.417 --> 30:17.542
We got another one
to ride the bull!

30:23.625 --> 30:26.125
OK, little doggie, you're up.

30:26.208 --> 30:29.125
Fun. I'm a doggie.

30:47.917 --> 30:51.125
Yeah. I'm here to ride this bull.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.959
Check it out.

31:11.667 --> 31:15.208
Andrew, you promised
you'd stay with your mother.

31:15.291 --> 31:18.792
Dad, she wants me out.
She put all my stuff on the front lawn.

31:18.875 --> 31:22.542
This is ridiculous. I'm gonna call her
and smooth all this out.

31:22.625 --> 31:24.959
- You're going home.
- Dad, why?

31:25.083 --> 31:27.166
Now I can live with you without guilt.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.750
It'll be like
our own little bachelor pad.

31:32.667 --> 31:35.834
- What?
- Son, that's not gonna happen.

31:36.041 --> 31:39.125
- Why not?
- Andrew...

31:40.709 --> 31:44.083
These last few months
have been incredibly difficult for me.

31:44.208 --> 31:46.792
There are things I've got to work out

31:46.875 --> 31:50.083
and I can't do it
if you're living with me. I'm sorry.

31:51.333 --> 31:54.500
I don't care. I'm not going back there.

31:54.583 --> 31:57.709
- I don't think you have a choice.
- But, Dad...

32:05.041 --> 32:08.417
Come on now. Don't...

32:14.250 --> 32:17.375
Heath? Yeah, it's me.

32:17.458 --> 32:20.250
Do you still have your fake ID?

32:20.375 --> 32:24.625
I've got to go home and kiss my mother's
ass and I'm not going to do it sober.

32:31.917 --> 32:35.583
...more than I needed to know.

32:35.709 --> 32:37.959
He was in shock.
He was totally shocked.

32:38.083 --> 32:42.417
He said, "Congressmen, this was
not the vote. You voted already."

32:42.500 --> 32:45.417
- That's what it was.
- I love that one!

32:46.333 --> 32:48.458
The desserts look wonderful.

32:49.625 --> 32:52.500
- Do you need any help?
- I got it covered. No problem.

32:52.583 --> 32:56.500
OK, Scavo. You're up.
Let's hear this genius idea of yours.

33:02.792 --> 33:07.166
The single greatest obstacle facing
Spotless Scrub is a lack of visibility.

33:07.291 --> 33:09.291
We need to concentrate ad spending

33:09.417 --> 33:12.709
in places where women spend
the majority of their time.

33:12.792 --> 33:16.458
For example, large chain grocery stores.

33:16.542 --> 33:21.792
Picture Spotless Scrub ads on the
side of every mother's shopping cart.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.291
- Interesting.
- You know what'd be better?

33:25.375 --> 33:27.542
- Dry-cleaning bags.
- What?

33:27.625 --> 33:29.250
No, hear me out.

33:29.333 --> 33:32.542
Put a big ad between
a woman and her cashmere sweater.

33:32.625 --> 33:36.333
- You'll get her attention.
- I'm in the middle of a thing here.

33:38.500 --> 33:42.166
She's got a point. I would notice that.

33:42.250 --> 33:45.250
Those dry-cleaning bags
hang in our closets forever.

33:45.333 --> 33:49.375
- So it is like constant advertising.
- Exactly!

33:49.500 --> 33:54.000
- Maybe we can work that in...
- This is a fantastic idea.

33:54.125 --> 33:58.125
- Can we go nationwide with this?
- Start by targeting the top chain.

33:58.208 --> 34:01.959
Then branch out from there.
Mass saturation.

34:02.041 --> 34:04.083
And you know what else would be great?

34:04.208 --> 34:07.417
<i>While Lynette was commanding</i>
<i>everyone's attention...</i>

34:08.834 --> 34:12.875
<i>Susan was trying to remain</i>
<i>inconspicuous.</i>

34:13.000 --> 34:15.291
Everybody's looking at me, aren't they?

34:15.375 --> 34:17.583
Just the slapstick fans.

34:17.667 --> 34:21.375
God, why couldn't I have
just been knocked unconscious?

34:22.959 --> 34:25.542
- Beer?
- Absolutely.

34:35.500 --> 34:39.041
- Susan, this is Kendra.
- We've been introduced.

34:39.125 --> 34:41.291
No. We've been friends for years.

34:41.375 --> 34:43.417
She's here on a visit.

34:43.500 --> 34:46.041
- That's it.
- It's true.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.667
I have no designs
on this man whatsoever.

34:50.166 --> 34:52.583
I'll be right back.

34:54.417 --> 34:57.500
- Sorry about the misunderstanding.
- Me, too.

34:57.583 --> 35:00.083
How long have you two
been seeing each other?

35:00.208 --> 35:03.333
Well, you sort of interrupted
our first date.

35:03.417 --> 35:06.500
But up until then,
smoking-hot tension.

35:07.583 --> 35:12.083
- Sounds pathetic, I know.
- No, it's good to take it slow.

35:12.166 --> 35:15.625
You'd be smart to be careful.

35:17.625 --> 35:19.875
- Any particular reason?
- Look...

35:19.959 --> 35:22.709
Mike's a wonderful guy. Really.

35:22.792 --> 35:27.041
But you should ask him
why he moved to Wisteria Lane.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.583
It's one hell of a story.

35:31.166 --> 35:33.542
Here. Got some ice.

35:33.625 --> 35:35.959
- There you go.
- Thanks.

35:48.583 --> 35:52.000
Well, it's been fun.
Thanks, guys. See you later.

35:55.417 --> 35:57.750
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

35:57.834 --> 35:59.792
Have a seat.

36:03.625 --> 36:06.166
I could get used to
this whole closure thing.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.792
I love long goodbyes.

36:19.375 --> 36:22.500
Wait around the corner.
I'll be right back.

36:31.250 --> 36:33.500
Smile, Gabrielle.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.291
Well, that's it, then.

36:56.208 --> 36:59.375
She had a camera.
We've got to catch her.

37:02.417 --> 37:06.792
Mrs. Solis, your husband's
going to kill us. Come on!

37:09.083 --> 37:12.166
- Leave me alone.
- Give me that camera!

37:12.250 --> 37:15.917
- I'm not kidding, old woman!
- Stay away from me! Don't touch me!

38:02.500 --> 38:04.250
No.

38:05.709 --> 38:08.959
No, you go home.
I'll take care of this.

38:09.834 --> 38:13.291
And you were never here. Go.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.917
Go!

38:20.417 --> 38:24.709
Did you see that? A guy came barreling
around the corner and just hit her.

38:24.792 --> 38:28.625
Do you have a cell phone?
Call 911.

39:04.041 --> 39:06.166
- What happened?
- Is she breathing?

39:06.291 --> 39:10.542
<i>As Juanita teetered dangerously close</i>
<i>to the white light,</i>

39:10.625 --> 39:14.583
<i>Lynette and Tom were headed</i>
<i>into a black hole.</i>

39:14.667 --> 39:16.125
I was just participating.

39:16.208 --> 39:19.875
Your participation was supposed
to be limited to making dinner,

39:19.959 --> 39:21.875
not making my ideas look bad.

39:21.959 --> 39:24.750
Maybe you need better ideas.

39:24.834 --> 39:27.125
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

39:27.208 --> 39:29.291
No, we both know that your career

39:29.375 --> 39:32.166
was going better than mine
before we had kids.

39:32.250 --> 39:35.333
- You never let me forget that.
- That is not fair.

39:35.417 --> 39:39.458
You were always competing with me,
and judging by tonight, you still are.

39:39.542 --> 39:41.834
Tom, I am sorry about tonight. Truly.

39:41.917 --> 39:45.542
But if I'm competing it's with
the Bree Van De Kamps of the world,

39:45.625 --> 39:48.542
with their spotless kitchens
and their perfect kids,

39:48.667 --> 39:52.000
who throw fabulous parties
where nothing ever goes wrong.

39:52.083 --> 39:54.583
I try so hard to keep up but I can't.

39:54.667 --> 39:59.625
And when you work on a pitch,
I am reminded of a world I left behind,

39:59.709 --> 40:02.792
where I was the winner
and people tried to keep up with me.

40:02.875 --> 40:05.625
I can't go back,
I can't win where I am.

40:05.709 --> 40:09.542
I am stuck in the middle
and it is really starting to get to me.

40:09.625 --> 40:14.208
For your information, I thought
you threw an amazing dinner party.

40:14.291 --> 40:18.291
I was thrilled. I don't know
how you pulled it all together.

40:21.667 --> 40:24.875
- Yeah, well...
- And whether you believe it or not,

40:24.959 --> 40:28.583
everyone who knows you thinks
that you are a great wife and mother.

40:28.750 --> 40:30.834
- No, they don't.
- Yes, they do.

40:32.125 --> 40:35.542
Especially me.

40:35.625 --> 40:37.583
Thanks.

40:39.083 --> 40:41.542
What's wrong with your eyes?

40:41.625 --> 40:44.041
Nothing. I'm tired.

40:45.083 --> 40:48.333
- Turn around. I want to look at you.
- I'm fine.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.917
What's going on outside?

41:01.375 --> 41:03.041
Right there.

41:06.959 --> 41:11.083
Thank God you're here. Will you take
care of Gabrielle for a minute?

41:11.166 --> 41:13.417
All right.

41:16.625 --> 41:19.792
Andrew. Thank God you're back.
I need your help, honey.

41:19.875 --> 41:22.583
There's been an accident.

41:23.917 --> 41:26.208
Andrew?

41:30.291 --> 41:32.583
Mama?

41:41.291 --> 41:43.542
Rex, you need to come home.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.834
Something's happened and we need you.

41:57.125 --> 42:01.250
<i>Competition. It means different things</i>
<i>to different people.</i>

42:01.333 --> 42:04.291
<i>But whether it's a friendly rivalry</i>

42:04.375 --> 42:06.250
<i>or a fight to the death...</i>

42:06.333 --> 42:07.834
Cheers.

42:07.959 --> 42:11.834
<i>...the end result is the same.</i>

42:11.959 --> 42:14.417
<i>There will be winners...</i>

42:15.542 --> 42:18.208
<i>and there will be losers.</i>

42:25.458 --> 42:28.208
<i>Of course, the trick is...</i>

42:28.333 --> 42:30.875
<i>to know which battles to fight.</i>

42:33.041 --> 42:35.458
<i>You see,</i>

42:35.542 --> 42:38.709
<i>no victory comes without a price.</i>
