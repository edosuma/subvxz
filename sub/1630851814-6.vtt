00:50.717 --> 00:53.052
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.136 --> 00:55.638
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

02:47.000 --> 02:48.835
You're still as beautiful as ever.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.436
Don't tell me you are…

03:07.478 --> 03:09.355
Hello, Young Master.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.630
Ga-on, wake up.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.341
Ga-on, wake up. Come on.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.426
Ga-on!

03:39.135 --> 03:40.428
I said, wake up!

03:43.264 --> 03:44.390
Elijah.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.893
What is it at this hour?

03:47.936 --> 03:50.563
-Yo-han's gone.
-What?

03:50.647 --> 03:52.065
You heard me. Yo-han's gone.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.567
He wasn't here when I woke up.

03:56.778 --> 03:57.987
Honestly, where did he go?

04:04.202 --> 04:06.287
Were you scared to find
that Yo-han's not here?

04:06.371 --> 04:08.998
-Who said I was scared?
-Maybe he's seeing his girlfriend?

04:11.251 --> 04:14.921
Yo-han's never left this house.

04:17.465 --> 04:18.925
Not ever since that accident.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.560
It's hot, be careful.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.361
What is it?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.614
What's with the poor heating
in this house?

04:42.323 --> 04:44.075
It's just big but useless.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.538
Be honest. You like Yo-han, don't you?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.748
-What?
-Seeing how you found

04:50.832 --> 04:52.792
that prison in the US for him,

04:52.875 --> 04:55.670
I bet you think it's meaningful work too.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.880
-But it's fun.
-Fun?

04:57.964 --> 04:59.215
Yes.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.176
Or would it have been more fun
if he decided to chop it off?

05:05.847 --> 05:07.473
So you are from the same bloodline.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.559
Don't say such a thing.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.561
Yo-han breaks

05:12.270 --> 05:13.813
whatever that's next to him.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.109
I don't want to be such a person.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.194
What do you mean by that?

05:20.278 --> 05:21.821
Didn't you hear from the maid?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.575
Yo-han's been like that
ever since he was little.

05:25.658 --> 05:29.579
He made the maid who fancied him
jump from the second floor.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.499
Then there's Dad too.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.211
And me.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.568
You still have that bad habit

06:01.944 --> 06:05.031
of laying your hands on anything
without knowing your place.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.574
Oh my, Young Master.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.993
So you only recognize me now?

06:17.794 --> 06:18.878
<i>My goodness.</i>

06:19.670 --> 06:21.255
They are so beautiful.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.093
Never in my life did I know
such a world existed.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.595
A world full of beautiful things.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.348
Stop making a fuss and learn your trade.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.392
What do I need to do to live like this?

06:34.352 --> 06:35.645
Do I need to be born again?

06:37.647 --> 06:40.149
The president here hates kids
who talk too much.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.276
Keep quiet
if you don't want to be kicked out.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.987
Then there's Master Yo-han too.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.365
I've never seen someone
so beautiful and handsome.

06:47.949 --> 06:51.202
-So how could he lock someone like that--
-Please!

07:01.045 --> 07:02.713
Try it, Young Master.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.215
I prepared this for you.

07:07.468 --> 07:08.594
Thanks.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.100
You should spend some time out
when the president's not around.

07:14.183 --> 07:15.518
I'll keep watch for you.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.520
Do you like me?

08:00.229 --> 08:01.230
Yes.

08:02.398 --> 08:03.941
How much?

08:04.650 --> 08:05.735
Pardon?

08:06.611 --> 08:08.112
How much do you like me?

08:09.697 --> 08:10.781
Very much.

08:10.865 --> 08:11.949
I like you very much.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.618
Really?

08:16.370 --> 08:19.207
-Then can you jump from here?
-What?

08:21.209 --> 08:22.710
Can you do that for me?

08:24.253 --> 08:25.505
Really?

08:41.145 --> 08:42.188
Seon-a…

09:01.332 --> 09:03.334
You were so cruel.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.045
I liked you so much…

09:07.046 --> 09:08.047
Don't make me laugh.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.342
It wasn't me that you liked,
but something else.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.356
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.692
Young Master!

09:28.401 --> 09:30.278
If you're busted, it won't end well.

09:30.361 --> 09:32.697
That man knows no mercy.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.118
Are you worried about me?

09:39.996 --> 09:41.581
You are worried about me, right?

09:44.375 --> 09:45.960
I like you so much, Young Master.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.129
Do you not like me?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.345
That's odd.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.098
Things keep disappearing these days.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.183
Really?

10:02.893 --> 10:06.814
Actually, there's something
that's been bothering me.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.941
What is it?

10:11.402 --> 10:13.237
I'm a little hesitant to say this,

10:14.113 --> 10:17.491
but Master Yo-han has been
leaving his room so often.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.328
The President clearly told him
to stay in the basement, but…

10:21.954 --> 10:25.166
-Really?
-Yes, so I'm worried myself.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.234
Not that one.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.530
That's a keepsake from my brother's mom.

10:57.448 --> 11:00.409
I'll tell everyone
about what I saw if you touch that.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.163
I was only looking at it
because it was beautiful.

11:04.246 --> 11:07.958
I know the President will kill me
if I touch the late madame's belongings.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.095
Do you like me?

12:03.431 --> 12:06.475
Then can you jump from here?

12:27.955 --> 12:29.081
Is that how it went?

12:30.207 --> 12:33.544
You sure have a good memory.
You're very smart.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.383
But it's true that I did like you.

12:39.467 --> 12:43.888
I like all things that sparkle, you see.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.640
Back then and even now.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.394
Really? You must have lived fiercely then.

12:51.061 --> 12:54.106
So now you're playing maid
to the foundation

12:54.982 --> 12:56.901
while robbing them, are you?

13:21.342 --> 13:23.135
No, I should say you're admirable.

13:23.802 --> 13:26.013
After removing your idiot brother,

13:26.096 --> 13:30.601
you rescued his daughter like a hero
so you won't be suspected.

13:32.686 --> 13:37.191
Jeez, anyone would have fallen for that.

13:42.029 --> 13:45.366
Why do you think it was Yo-han who did it?
I'm sure you had your reasons.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.117
His computer.

13:47.826 --> 13:48.702
Computer?

13:50.579 --> 13:55.376
I hacked into his computer for fun
when I was 12.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.586
I saw he had a folder that was hidden,

13:58.754 --> 14:01.507
so I looked through it.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.175
And there it was.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.303
A request to cancel the donation MoU.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.557
Moreover, it was created…

14:12.017 --> 14:13.394
a week before the fire.

14:17.648 --> 14:22.236
All I had left was Yo-han. But…

14:23.779 --> 14:24.947
He…

14:46.927 --> 14:48.596
Enough about the past.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.098
Get down to business.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.227
Shall I, then?

14:56.478 --> 14:59.565
I don't care whether
you have fun at your trial

14:59.648 --> 15:01.567
or boil Cha Gyeong-hui alive,

15:01.650 --> 15:04.737
but please stop poking your nose
into our foundation's affairs.

15:04.820 --> 15:08.073
What you're about to do
is messing with a sheep farm

15:08.157 --> 15:10.326
we worked so hard to build.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.494
I see this Dream Base project or whatever

15:12.995 --> 15:15.623
is something that really sparkles.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.417
We're the same kind, aren't we?

15:18.500 --> 15:20.419
As long as we don't impede
on each other's territory,

15:20.502 --> 15:23.339
-we could do a lot of fun--
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.507
Waste time, I mean.

15:26.216 --> 15:30.220
It'll be better to just kill me
when you have the chance.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.430
It's way faster.

15:32.139 --> 15:36.602
Because you won't have the chance
again to hold me down like this.

15:38.854 --> 15:40.356
If that's how you'll be…

15:40.439 --> 15:41.732
Blackmailing me is useless.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.902
Because I have

15:45.903 --> 15:47.363
nothing to protect.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.365
Really?

16:02.378 --> 16:03.754
That's too bad.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.485
What's with that reaction
when you're the one who stabbed him?

16:27.027 --> 16:29.405
It's the needles
I dread the most in this world.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.449
Oh, sure.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.619
Jae-hee,

16:36.245 --> 16:39.498
take our Young Master back to his home.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.375
What?

16:41.458 --> 16:43.877
Why not just finish him off now
as he suggested?

16:43.961 --> 16:48.215
No, sheepdogs need wolves too.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.800
The more he acts out of his way,

16:49.883 --> 16:53.053
the more those old geezers
at the foundation will rely on me.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.683
Still, this guy was just too fearless.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.985
So you say you have nothing to protect?

17:19.997 --> 17:21.874
There's no one like that.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.133
Where were you last night, Judge Kang?

19:38.552 --> 19:40.804
Now you're interested
in my private affairs too?

19:42.389 --> 19:44.558
I was with a rather
tough woman last night.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.352
She yanked my hair and started kissing--

19:47.436 --> 19:49.521
No, it's fine.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.214
-Ga-on.
-Yes?

20:16.215 --> 20:18.884
-Open that for me.
-What?

20:19.468 --> 20:20.886
Open that for me.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.182
Sure.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.061
-That?
-Yes.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.774
You want <i>ramyeon</i> in the morning?

20:35.192 --> 20:36.652
Add some hot water and bring it to me.

21:10.435 --> 21:11.520
Elijah.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.856
What about my <i>ramyeon</i>?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.109
Let's eat a proper meal
instead of <i>ramyeon</i>

21:17.192 --> 21:18.318
A proper meal?

21:19.861 --> 21:21.488
Judge Kang, let's eat.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.156
All of a sudden?

21:24.283 --> 21:27.452
Honestly, I'm fed up with you all.
Let's eat a proper meal, all right?

21:28.078 --> 21:30.622
I made it for living off you, so hurry up.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.040
Same for you, Judge Kang.

21:39.673 --> 21:43.427
Oh what? Who asked him to cook?
He should just mind his own.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.137
I can see you smiling.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.639
Hey!

21:52.644 --> 21:54.730
What's with that displeased look
on your face?

21:54.813 --> 21:55.981
Just. Well, this is new.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.607
What's new?

21:59.026 --> 22:03.447
What's with that tender gaze
directed at Ga-on?

22:03.530 --> 22:04.698
When did I?

22:04.781 --> 22:06.158
I said hurry up!

22:06.241 --> 22:07.993
-Yes.
-Yes.

22:08.076 --> 22:09.578
I'm going to kill you!

22:22.632 --> 22:24.217
You call this a simple meal?

22:24.301 --> 22:27.137
<i>Shall I order more salmon, Master Ga-on?</i>

22:27.220 --> 22:28.805
Yes, and some celery too.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.599
"Master Ga-on?"

22:31.475 --> 22:33.226
By the way, this is Korean, isn't it?

22:33.310 --> 22:34.436
You don't like Korean?

22:35.353 --> 22:38.857
I must have been the court lady
in the kitchen. I just hate Korean.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.151
I bet I died after eating a poisoned dish.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.070
If you don't want to eat it, then fine.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.865
I'll at least taste how bad it is for you.

22:46.948 --> 22:48.492
You'll find no poison in there.

23:00.587 --> 23:01.755
What are you doing? Eat.

23:03.131 --> 23:05.300
As I told you before,
I can't really taste food.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.720
I only chew and swallow.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.150
-So you really can't taste food, can you?
-No.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.196
Have some more of this.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.200
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

23:31.368 --> 23:34.246
I told you. I should do my share
since I'm living off you.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.748
Well, let me tell you now,

23:36.832 --> 23:38.375
but I want no pity.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.836
I'm not in a position to offer any.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.797
Do you want some fruit?
Tell me if you need anything else.

23:43.880 --> 23:44.798
Sure.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.969
Where did you learn how to cook?

23:50.846 --> 23:52.597
-Learn?
-Then?

23:52.681 --> 23:54.432
I spent 16 years
as the son of restaurant owners

23:54.516 --> 23:56.476
and 13 years living on my own.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.021
Once you're the son of restaurant owners,
aren't you forever the son of them?

24:00.105 --> 24:02.149
Or did your parents stop
running a restaurant?

24:07.821 --> 24:09.489
It just turned out that way.

24:10.073 --> 24:11.533
Have some kiwifruit.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.410
What is this?

24:17.330 --> 24:18.623
Young Master!

24:19.583 --> 24:23.170
What is this cozy atmosphere
that's unbefitting of this house?

24:24.296 --> 24:25.297
Young Master.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.801
But you'd never touch the food
I cook for you.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.179
We saved some for you too.

24:40.228 --> 24:41.521
Elijah.

24:44.107 --> 24:45.567
You're not in bed yet, are you?

24:45.650 --> 24:48.111
Just digesting.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.030
It didn't taste so bad,

24:50.113 --> 24:53.033
but I'm not a heavy eater. That's all.

24:53.116 --> 24:55.076
Oh really? That was for a whole week.

24:55.744 --> 24:56.703
Don't exaggerate.

24:58.496 --> 25:00.790
-Do you have some time tomorrow?
-What?

25:02.959 --> 25:04.252
Well…

25:04.336 --> 25:07.255
I'll have to see.

25:07.923 --> 25:08.965
But why?

25:09.049 --> 25:11.218
If you don't mind,
I'd like you to meet someone.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.389
Oh, you're bringing someone?

25:17.807 --> 25:18.850
But who?

25:20.810 --> 25:21.853
My friend.

25:22.437 --> 25:23.480
Friend?

25:32.906 --> 25:34.115
Hello.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.117
You're here. Come in.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.703
Hello, Ms. Elijah.

25:39.746 --> 25:40.580
I'm…

25:43.833 --> 25:45.377
just Yoon Su-hyeon.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.630
I heard a lot about you from him.

25:48.713 --> 25:51.424
He's really not the type
to mind others, you know.

25:51.508 --> 25:52.968
Don't distort the facts.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.344
What are you two?

25:57.555 --> 25:58.765
Why do you ask?

25:58.848 --> 26:00.350
We're just friends.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.769
-Didn't Ga-on say so?
-He didn't.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.813
That he had such a pretty friend.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.482
-You think she's pretty?
-Hey, why are you laughing?

26:07.565 --> 26:10.193
You're much prettier than me, Ms. Elijah.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.028
I guess that's true.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.616
I'm sorry if I was stepping over the line,

26:16.700 --> 26:18.618
but I thought it'd be nice
if you had a sister.

26:18.702 --> 26:22.038
Can I talk casually to you next time
so we can get closer?

26:22.122 --> 26:24.374
Or you could just call me Su-hyeon.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.251
Yes, that's a good idea.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.587
-No, thank you.
-What?

26:29.671 --> 26:31.214
I'm not a little kid anymore.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.841
I'll be 20 in four years too.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.303
Right.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.055
Sure, Ms. Elijah.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.339
Where is Elijah?

27:12.422 --> 27:14.090
I haven't seen her either.

27:21.514 --> 27:25.477
Do you have the file that you said
you found on his computer?

27:31.399 --> 27:32.317
No.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.611
Su-hyeon, why are you asking her
about that now?

27:34.694 --> 27:35.904
Well, I just thought…

27:38.615 --> 27:40.116
Elijah.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.036
It may have been going overboard,
donating his entire fortune.

27:43.119 --> 27:45.038
Maybe he nullified it for you.

27:45.121 --> 27:47.916
And the date created
may not always be right.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.543
No, I want to make sure
we're clear on that one.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.679
Judge Kang.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.642
Don't you know this is
the abduction of minors?

28:05.725 --> 28:07.060
That's enough, Judge Kang.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.897
Whoever messes with her
will have to deal with me.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.065
No matter who that is.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.918
-I'm not getting in.
-Don't be such a kid.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.294
I said I'm not getting in!

28:33.378 --> 28:34.421
Stop being such a kid!

28:34.504 --> 28:35.797
Am I your toy?

28:35.880 --> 28:37.382
You think I'm easy
because I'm in this state?

28:41.511 --> 28:43.596
Did you have to do that back then?

28:49.978 --> 28:51.020
Elijah.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.734
What are you doing?
Let's just hurry up and go.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.497
I'll do it.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.868
-Let me pour you one.
-I'll have the North Star.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.704
-Gosh, I'm going to be drunk.
-You're allowed to be.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.958
Why are kids these days so handsome?

29:54.042 --> 29:56.836
-It's so nice, isn't it?
-It is!

29:58.213 --> 29:59.214
-Hey, you.
-Yes, ma'am.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.507
-Come here.
-Okay.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.759
-So you're a K-Pop idol?
-Yes, ma'am.

30:02.842 --> 30:05.512
Ma'am, I have a little gift for you.
Now where is it?

30:05.595 --> 30:07.555
-A gift?
-Here it is!

30:09.057 --> 30:10.141
Wow, that's adorable!

30:10.225 --> 30:12.101
Where did you pick that up?

30:17.232 --> 30:18.149
Ladies.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.152
-Ladies!
-Yes, what is it?

30:21.236 --> 30:23.029
-One moment.
-Sure.

30:23.112 --> 30:25.490
-Let's have a toast.
-Shall we?

30:25.573 --> 30:29.452
Here's to wishing you
go all the way to the Billboard!

30:33.832 --> 30:37.126
Oh gosh. Girls.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.087
Get up.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.557
Sit down.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.599
Let's sit.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.063
Minister Cha.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.650
I'll get straight to the point.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.486
Prepare to be summoned by
the prosecution soon.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.738
Gyeong-hui!

31:46.821 --> 31:48.281
Gyeong-hui, what's this about?

31:49.490 --> 31:52.535
The shantytown where the second
Dream Base complex is to be.

31:53.202 --> 31:55.872
I saw you bought up the property
under a borrowed name.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.917
This project is to revive the economy,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.503
not a chance for you to get rich
with information you sneaked out.

32:03.463 --> 32:04.839
You were greedy this time.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.176
-Gyeong-hui.
-Gyeong-hui, please help us.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.470
We're not strangers, are we?

32:10.553 --> 32:13.348
If there was a misunderstanding,
let's clear that up.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.933
We just…

32:16.100 --> 32:19.228
We just thought you might be having
a hard time because of Young-min.

32:19.312 --> 32:21.564
That's why we've been
refraining from calling you.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.024
Poor Young-min…

32:24.484 --> 32:26.653
-I'll leave you to it then.
-But we mean it!

32:26.736 --> 32:28.571
Gyeong-hui, please!

32:28.655 --> 32:30.949
-Minister Cha?
-Gyeong-hui!

32:32.367 --> 32:34.369
-Minister Cha.
-Oh no…

32:35.995 --> 32:36.913
Gosh.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.667
-What do we do now?
-If this gets out,

32:41.417 --> 32:45.797
Minbo Group is done for.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.550
After all that our station did,
raising funds for the project…

32:49.634 --> 32:50.551
My head…

32:55.056 --> 32:56.224
Director Jung.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.309
What do we do?

32:58.393 --> 32:59.811
Do you think there's a way?

33:01.229 --> 33:04.190
It seems Minister Cha
has been feeling left out

33:04.273 --> 33:06.401
from the management of the foundation.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.236
Right?

33:08.820 --> 33:12.031
I think only Chairman Seo
will be able to handle this one

33:12.115 --> 33:14.450
since this is all due to
our foundation's project.

33:15.868 --> 33:16.995
Director Jung.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.539
You put in a good word to him for us.

33:19.622 --> 33:20.456
Yes.

33:20.540 --> 33:24.335
I'll donate all that land…

33:25.420 --> 33:27.880
-to the foundation.
-All of it?

33:28.840 --> 33:30.633
You want to be summoned
by the prosecution with your husband?

33:30.717 --> 33:34.595
-Cha Gyeong-hui's full of spite right now.
-Oh, all right.

33:35.179 --> 33:37.098
We'll donate all of ours too.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.475
So please put in a good word for us.

33:41.227 --> 33:42.895
I'll do my best.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.481
After all, this is all for you.

33:47.066 --> 33:49.277
Thank you so much, Seon-a.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.490
<i>Was that enough?</i>

33:55.158 --> 33:58.453
Yes, and I'm sure Chairman Seo
will be very pleased.

34:01.748 --> 34:04.000
So who is the real Chairman Seo?

34:05.376 --> 34:08.421
Is it that man
who's always holed up meditating?

34:09.213 --> 34:10.256
Or…

34:12.842 --> 34:15.386
Is that so important?

34:18.931 --> 34:20.224
Then again…

34:20.892 --> 34:24.228
Just get Kang Yo-han
as you said you will.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.234
<i>I'll protect you</i>

34:30.943 --> 34:32.070
no matter what.

34:33.821 --> 34:37.366
Please stop that summoning order for us.

34:37.450 --> 34:40.912
My husband may not look it,
but he's really a wuss.

34:40.995 --> 34:45.041
He suffers from angina, so who knows
what will happen during the questioning?

34:45.625 --> 34:47.251
Same with my old man.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.836
He has a fear of cameras,

34:48.920 --> 34:52.006
so he might have a panic attack
in front of all those reporters.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.051
Don't worry.
I'll try to find a way somehow.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.846
We have Chairman Seo, don't we?

34:58.930 --> 35:00.890
So just wait and see.

35:00.973 --> 35:03.184
I'll trust you, Director Jung.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.520
-If you need anything, tell us.
-Sure.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.688
-Yes, we'll give you whatever.
-Sure.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.315
-Thank you, Seon-a.
-Sure!

35:17.615 --> 35:20.034
"My old man, my husband…"

35:20.868 --> 35:23.079
What a tear-jerker.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.146
All right.

35:48.229 --> 35:52.567
I'll also need to see
whether our Young Master

35:53.693 --> 35:55.361
has nothing to protect.

35:59.448 --> 36:00.783
<i>Are you hurt anywhere?</i>

36:02.326 --> 36:03.786
I let my guard down.

36:04.453 --> 36:06.330
<i>She was a total psycho.</i>

36:06.414 --> 36:09.584
I'll tighten security
and trail Jung Seon-a.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.175
Judge Kang, about before…

36:17.258 --> 36:20.386
Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon of WAIS 1
at the SMPA.

36:20.469 --> 36:23.556
Proxime accessit at KNPU,
address is 2700-2, Nowon-gu, Seoul.

36:23.639 --> 36:26.684
Her father is Yoon Ju-won, age 64,
and her mother is Joo Eun-jung, age 59.

36:26.767 --> 36:27.810
What are you doing?

36:27.894 --> 36:30.897
How could you have Elijah meet the police?

36:30.980 --> 36:32.481
I thought Elijah might be lonely…

36:32.565 --> 36:34.317
I clearly warned you

36:34.400 --> 36:37.153
that I have no hesitation in
removing what stands in my way.

36:37.236 --> 36:38.821
Don't jump to conclusions.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.740
Lay one finger on Su-hyeon, and I will…

36:40.823 --> 36:41.991
Now I'm curious

36:42.658 --> 36:43.951
about what will happen

36:44.827 --> 36:46.412
if I mess with Yoon Su-hyeon.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.799
Su-hyeon, listen to me.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.134
Be careful, okay?

37:00.218 --> 37:02.136
<i>Okay, I get it. All right.</i>

37:02.845 --> 37:04.305
I said I've got this.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.808
Hey, I'm being serious here.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.102
<i>You're in danger.</i>

37:11.354 --> 37:13.481
<i>What happened to
the chic Kim Ga-on I know?</i>

37:13.564 --> 37:15.024
I said you might be in danger.

37:25.618 --> 37:26.869
Let me call you back.

37:41.467 --> 37:42.426
Who are you?

37:58.985 --> 37:59.944
Hey!

38:01.612 --> 38:04.865
A biker should always
hold onto their keys.

38:12.665 --> 38:13.708
What the hell?

40:08.697 --> 40:09.740
Seon-a.

40:09.824 --> 40:13.577
I exposed myself as you told me to,
but do we really have to do this?

40:13.661 --> 40:16.163
-We're just sowing the seed of doubt.
-Seed of doubt?

40:16.247 --> 40:20.876
Once the seed of doubt sprouts,
it'll grow and grow.

40:22.044 --> 40:25.297
You always go to such effort
when it involves Kang Yo-han.

40:27.216 --> 40:28.759
But it's fun.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.386
Sure, madame.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.681
-Then let me go to my next target now.
-Take care.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.266
Shall I get going too then?

40:35.349 --> 40:36.392
To sow seeds?

40:51.198 --> 40:52.533
-Take care.
-Yes, thank you.

40:52.616 --> 40:53.576
I'll see you again.

41:03.210 --> 41:05.379
Why even go after them? It's dangerous.

41:06.255 --> 41:10.009
Before that,
who could be spying on you, Professor?

41:12.219 --> 41:13.596
Kang Yo-han, maybe?

41:14.263 --> 41:15.139
Kang Yo-han?

41:15.681 --> 41:18.517
You see, I've been meeting
with some distinguished officials

41:18.601 --> 41:19.852
to discuss some things.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.814
They're also worried about
what Kang Yo-han's been up to.

41:24.690 --> 41:28.777
You saw how the kids mimicking
the flogging in front of the restaurant.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.280
It's worrisome.

41:45.044 --> 41:46.462
You should be more careful.

41:47.129 --> 41:48.005
That was close.

41:48.964 --> 41:49.924
Wasn't it?

41:53.469 --> 41:57.181
Hello, Director Jung.
Sorry, my mind is all over the place.

41:57.264 --> 42:00.267
So what brings you here
at the Supreme Court today?

42:00.351 --> 42:03.103
I'm here to see someone
about our foundation's work.

42:03.187 --> 42:05.022
But aren't I lucky today?

42:06.190 --> 42:08.108
I just bumped into someone

42:08.192 --> 42:10.194
I'd been wanting to meet again.

42:12.863 --> 42:13.989
Me?

42:15.741 --> 42:18.077
You're really popular these days,
Judge Oh.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.537
You're a star now.

42:20.246 --> 42:22.873
Please. It's Judge Kang who's the star.

42:23.541 --> 42:27.211
Everyone's been saying you're the most
humane and down-to-earth person.

42:27.294 --> 42:29.630
That you understand the position
the weak are in.

42:29.713 --> 42:33.217
That's only because that's how I lived.

42:33.300 --> 42:35.302
I knew it.

42:38.347 --> 42:41.308
People who are from the slums
instantly recognize each other.

42:42.268 --> 42:43.602
It's like a radar.

42:46.730 --> 42:49.316
Then Director Jung, you also…

42:52.528 --> 42:55.698
By the way, isn't this place a little odd?

42:56.282 --> 42:57.157
How so?

42:58.576 --> 43:01.620
Why are they all middle-aged men
with solemn looks on their faces?

43:02.246 --> 43:04.582
Every single one, without exception.

43:14.633 --> 43:15.634
Well, that's…

43:15.718 --> 43:16.802
Try being more greedy.

43:17.511 --> 43:19.054
I told you before, didn't I?

43:19.138 --> 43:21.765
You were the one who shined the most

43:21.849 --> 43:23.392
on the <i>Live Court Show</i>.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.437
Twinkle, twinkle.

43:49.335 --> 43:52.004
<i>My fellow Koreans, this is our festival!</i>

43:52.087 --> 43:54.882
<i>As Judge Kang Yo-han said,
"This court, answering to the will"</i>

43:54.965 --> 43:58.802
<i>of our people, sentences
all the trashy bastards to flogging!"</i>

43:58.886 --> 44:00.346
<i>Unit Jukchang!</i>

44:01.513 --> 44:03.140
<i>Let's go for it!</i>

44:08.270 --> 44:09.688
<i>Did you just steal our wallet?</i>

44:12.566 --> 44:13.942
<i>Hey, search him.</i>

44:14.943 --> 44:16.737
<i>But this is my wallet.</i>

44:16.820 --> 44:18.322
<i>He's a pickpocket!</i>

44:19.281 --> 44:20.366
<i>Don't!</i>

44:21.158 --> 44:24.078
<i>Spycam criminals, pickpockets, hooligans…</i>

44:24.161 --> 44:26.413
You bastards who are ruining Korea!

44:26.497 --> 44:29.333
Let's wipe them out with our own hands,

44:29.416 --> 44:31.460
-because we are the power.
-We are the power!

44:31.543 --> 44:33.712
-We are the power!
-We are the power!

44:39.802 --> 44:41.345
Get lost!

44:41.428 --> 44:42.596
Get lost, you punks!

44:45.933 --> 44:47.309
Flog him!

45:02.241 --> 45:05.702
LIVE: UNIT JUKCHANG WIPES OUT
ALL THE TRASH IN KOREA

45:12.960 --> 45:16.255
WITHDRAWAL

45:18.841 --> 45:20.551
<i>Insert card.</i>

45:23.804 --> 45:25.055
ALL IN CASH

46:00.215 --> 46:02.134
Dr. Safety.

46:02.217 --> 46:05.345
What are you doing
instead of managing wastewater?

46:09.975 --> 46:12.352
One, two, three, four, five,

46:12.436 --> 46:13.645
six, seven…

46:14.688 --> 46:16.523
How many zeroes is this?

46:21.236 --> 46:22.446
<i>Yes, Su-hyeon.</i>

46:22.529 --> 46:23.864
Do you remember Jang Ki-hyeon? Dr. Safety.

46:23.947 --> 46:26.366
<i>-You mean, from Joo Il-do's case?</i>
-Yes. It seems like…

46:27.534 --> 46:30.579
-he has a generous benefactor.
-Kang Yo-han?

46:30.662 --> 46:32.831
We'll have to see. I'm going to request
a warrant to track his account.

46:32.915 --> 46:36.168
Su-hyeon, this is dangerous.
He knows all of your personal details.

46:36.251 --> 46:38.170
Not just your address,
but your parents' names too.

46:38.253 --> 46:40.088
<i>Hey, I'm an officer.</i>

46:40.172 --> 46:43.175
I can't just stay put
because some gangster knows where I live.

46:55.646 --> 46:57.147
<i>Will you stop this nonsense?</i>

46:57.814 --> 47:00.567
Track Kang Yo-han's account?
Are you in your right mind?

47:00.651 --> 47:02.736
I told you, sir.

47:02.819 --> 47:04.279
There are reasons to suspect--

47:04.363 --> 47:06.657
Hey, having some money in
your account doesn't equal bribery.

47:06.740 --> 47:08.784
Jang Ki-hyeon had been
financially unstable.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.410
His paychecks were withheld--

47:10.494 --> 47:13.705
Just what are you up to these days?

47:13.789 --> 47:17.417
The police agency will be told to disband
if you mess with Kang Yo-han now.

47:19.211 --> 47:22.130
I tried talking to Chief,
but his reaction was strange.

47:22.214 --> 47:23.423
<i>He immediately got fractious.</i>

47:23.507 --> 47:26.426
Is he the one who jumped up and down
when you said you wanted to

47:26.510 --> 47:28.095
-track Kang Yo-han down?
-<i>Yes.</i>

47:32.558 --> 47:34.434
I turned her away for now,

47:34.518 --> 47:36.436
but I don't think
she'll give up so easily.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.230
All right, I'll call you back.

47:41.900 --> 47:44.403
<i>She keeps digging into
Jang Ki-hyeon's account history.</i>

47:47.656 --> 47:49.116
What an annoying woman.

47:49.199 --> 47:52.119
<i>She may already be on to
how the funds were transferred too.</i>

47:52.911 --> 47:54.162
What should I do?

47:55.247 --> 47:56.790
-Get started.
-<i>Yes, sir.</i>

48:01.795 --> 48:05.132
I didn't have a good feeling about it,
so I just told him okay and left.

48:05.215 --> 48:08.093
<i>Who knows what the scope
of his influence is.</i>

48:08.176 --> 48:09.177
Good job. First…

48:36.079 --> 48:39.416
Don't you think
Judge King is little weird these days?

48:40.167 --> 48:41.293
What do you mean?

48:41.376 --> 48:45.088
Well, I picked out some potential cases
for our next <i>Live Court Show</i>,

48:45.172 --> 48:47.341
but he barely glanced at them
and told me to just leave them there.

48:48.842 --> 48:51.261
I think his mind is somewhere else.

48:53.639 --> 48:55.932
We're in the same team.
So if he has a dilemma,

48:56.016 --> 48:57.726
shouldn't he share them with us?

49:00.145 --> 49:02.105
Or is he not happy
with us associate judges?

49:05.317 --> 49:08.236
Is he looking down on us or what?

49:08.945 --> 49:10.947
What are your thoughts, Judge Kim?

49:11.948 --> 49:13.075
What do you think?

49:14.743 --> 49:15.911
Judge Kim.

49:19.081 --> 49:21.375
-Kim Ga-on!
-Yes?

49:22.042 --> 49:23.502
Oh. I'm sorry.

49:23.585 --> 49:26.755
-I didn't get much sleep last night.
-Were you on a date or something?

49:27.589 --> 49:31.218
You all must have so much free time.
We're at an important juncture here.

49:31.885 --> 49:34.763
We need to really seal it
while the public's all for us.

49:39.768 --> 49:40.769
Ga-on.

49:41.770 --> 49:43.188
Jang Ki-hyeon disappeared.

49:43.271 --> 49:45.774
<i>What do you mean?
Did you go there to see him alone?</i>

49:45.857 --> 49:47.693
I rang the bell but no one would answer,

49:47.776 --> 49:50.654
so I just picked the lock
and the entire place is a mess.

49:50.737 --> 49:52.072
<i>There were traces
of a physical struggle too.</i>

49:52.155 --> 49:54.032
Hey, get out of there now.

49:54.658 --> 49:56.868
Do you think
something may have happened to him?

49:57.411 --> 49:58.370
I better…

50:02.040 --> 50:05.293
Oh my! Excuse me!

50:05.377 --> 50:06.962
Oh no… Are you okay?

50:07.045 --> 50:08.130
-Hello?
<i>-Su-hyeon.</i>

50:08.213 --> 50:09.798
-Miss!
<i>-This isn't funny.</i>

50:09.881 --> 50:11.550
<i>-Su-hyeon?</i>
-Are you all right, Miss?

50:11.633 --> 50:13.719
<i>-Su-hyeon!</i>
-Can you hear me? Oh no.

50:19.099 --> 50:20.058
Su-hyeon.

50:26.398 --> 50:28.024
I had the bankbook with me,

50:28.108 --> 50:30.068
but they snatched it.

50:30.152 --> 50:32.863
-I'm such an idiot.
-Stupid, that's not so important here.

50:38.285 --> 50:40.370
I'm really fine.

50:40.454 --> 50:41.496
This is nothing!

50:41.580 --> 50:45.000
Didn't you just throw a fuss about
how you're going to die?

50:45.667 --> 50:49.671
I was just considering
all the possibilities.

50:50.338 --> 50:54.426
You were extremely fortunate.
Those injuries could have been critical.

51:02.893 --> 51:05.979
Look at me in the eye.
Are you really okay?

51:09.900 --> 51:11.234
Well, I was scared though.

51:12.944 --> 51:14.321
That I'll never see you again.

51:24.664 --> 51:25.582
Su-hyeon.

51:27.125 --> 51:28.126
What's this about?

51:28.210 --> 51:31.630
<i>We received a report
that Judge Kang Yo-han had offered</i>

51:31.713 --> 51:35.926
<i>a large sum of money to Mr. Jang,
who was a key witness</i>

51:36.009 --> 51:39.554
<i>to President Joo Il-do's case,
the first</i> Live Court Show <i>trial.</i>

51:39.638 --> 51:43.225
If it is indeed true that Jang had
committed perjury for monetary rewards,

51:43.308 --> 51:44.893
this is a serious crime.

51:44.976 --> 51:46.520
What's more surprising is that

51:46.603 --> 51:49.189
<i>the witness in question, Jang,
is currently missing.</i>

51:50.524 --> 51:55.195
<i>The Ministry of Justice will thoroughly
investigate all the suspicions</i>

51:55.278 --> 51:58.698
surrounding the <i>Live Court Show</i>
until we reach the truth. Thank you.

51:58.782 --> 52:00.700
What are your grounds for this briefing?

52:00.784 --> 52:03.411
He'd gone to such lengths
to block this, did he?

52:39.698 --> 52:41.700
How dare you mess with Su-hyeon!

53:42.802 --> 53:45.263
That's your reason for
getting so worked up?

53:45.347 --> 53:46.806
But it was your doing.

53:46.890 --> 53:49.601
I never laid a finger
on that childhood friend of yours.

53:49.684 --> 53:51.227
How am I supposed to believe you?

53:51.311 --> 53:53.355
It's up to you
whether to believe me or not.

53:54.147 --> 53:55.065
Kim Ga-on.

53:56.816 --> 53:58.526
Don't ever attack me again.

54:00.528 --> 54:01.655
Ever.

54:03.448 --> 54:06.993
<i>We received a report
that Judge Kang Yo-han had offered</i>

54:07.077 --> 54:11.039

54:19.464 --> 54:21.257
<i>this is a serious crime.</i>

54:21.341 --> 54:22.968
Yes, Jae-hee.

54:23.051 --> 54:25.095
I'm watching it now.

54:25.178 --> 54:26.763
Good work.

54:26.846 --> 54:29.641
Don't you think
you're overworking me these days?

54:30.350 --> 54:32.560
I'm going to report you
to the Ministry of Labor.

54:32.644 --> 54:35.230
You didn't even do much, so stop barking.

54:35.313 --> 54:36.815
<i>…all suspicions surrounding
the</i> Live Court Show

54:36.898 --> 54:40.110
<i>until we reach the truth. Thank you.</i>

54:44.739 --> 54:47.867
Hey, why are you only coming
into work now? It's chaos here.

54:47.951 --> 54:50.036
Did you hear anything from Judge Kang?

54:57.252 --> 54:58.253
This can't be…

54:59.713 --> 55:01.631
We were only getting started.

55:02.424 --> 55:04.217
After all that we've been through too!

55:32.912 --> 55:33.955
Minister Cha.

55:36.082 --> 55:39.085
Isn't our meeting rather appropriate,
no matter how you look at it?

55:39.919 --> 55:41.379
What's your business?

55:42.547 --> 55:45.633
I have a hunch who gave you what,

55:45.717 --> 55:48.678
but you won't be able to prove
anything with that.

55:49.387 --> 55:50.472
Prove?

55:51.514 --> 55:52.891
Look, Judge Kang.

55:52.974 --> 55:54.309
I'm sure you know best

55:54.392 --> 55:56.936
that in the court of the public,
it's not evidence,

55:57.020 --> 55:58.980
but the overall picture that's important.

55:59.064 --> 56:01.524
And the picture's already been drawn,
am I not right?

56:01.608 --> 56:03.610
How long did you think you could stay smug

56:03.693 --> 56:06.362
after making me shed tears of blood?

56:13.369 --> 56:14.454
Tears of blood?

56:18.625 --> 56:20.043
What do you think you're doing?

56:21.586 --> 56:24.214
I'm sorry to be so rude,
but I just couldn't hold it in.

56:24.297 --> 56:28.051
Of all the people, I didn't expect to you,

56:28.134 --> 56:32.055
an expert on slander, manipulation
and interrogations,

56:32.138 --> 56:34.808
to say you shed tears of blood.

56:37.560 --> 56:38.728
Watch your words!

56:49.280 --> 56:51.783
I thought I'd offer a deal,

56:51.866 --> 56:53.618
but have it your way.

56:53.701 --> 56:54.702
Please.

56:56.996 --> 56:58.206
Then please excuse me.

57:09.551 --> 57:11.094
That psycho bastard.

57:25.358 --> 57:26.568
Are you crazy?

57:28.778 --> 57:30.113
I'll handle it.

57:30.738 --> 57:32.240
Handle it how?

57:32.866 --> 57:34.409
This is just disgraceful!

57:35.160 --> 57:37.912
How could you commit fraud
in the courthouse

57:37.996 --> 57:39.038
with the entire nation watching you?

57:40.874 --> 57:42.083
Did you just say fraud?

57:42.167 --> 57:43.918
A judge just paid money to a witness.

57:44.002 --> 57:46.296
How is that not a fraudulent trial?

57:46.379 --> 57:48.089
They're all just one-sided claims.

57:48.173 --> 57:50.091
First, give me the chance to clear up--

57:50.175 --> 57:53.219
The trial you presided was
a trial of the public opinion.

57:54.429 --> 57:56.848
Not a trial
that goes by the principles of law.

57:57.765 --> 58:01.019
Throw a boomerang,
and it'll come back to you.

58:01.102 --> 58:04.981
And public opinion can be rash and brutal.

58:05.064 --> 58:08.193
Do you think
they will be willing to wait patiently

58:08.276 --> 58:10.195
while you defend yourself
as per the law and principles?

58:10.278 --> 58:14.449
Exactly. We'll see stones hurled at
the court for protecting you.

58:14.532 --> 58:16.034
Turn in your resignation letter.

58:16.117 --> 58:19.162
Put the <i>Live Court Show</i> on hiatus for now.

58:19.245 --> 58:22.165
-And distribute the press release first.
-Yes, sir.

58:25.502 --> 58:27.629
I did warn you to get off your high horse.

58:44.812 --> 58:46.147
Here comes Judge Kang!

58:51.444 --> 58:52.654
One comment please.

58:52.737 --> 58:54.155
One comment please, Judge Kang.

58:54.239 --> 58:55.949
-Did you really bribe the witness?
-Did you deceive our nation?

58:56.032 --> 58:57.867
Do you know anything
about his disappearance?

58:57.951 --> 58:59.118
One comment, please!

58:59.202 --> 59:01.663
The camera loves that Kang Yo-han

59:01.746 --> 59:03.831
even without the lights and all that.

59:03.915 --> 59:05.166
His face is never puffy.

59:05.250 --> 59:08.711
Does he get massages every day?

59:08.795 --> 59:10.922
He's still no match for you,
Mr. President.

59:11.005 --> 59:14.175
But I was born with superior DNA
to start with.

59:14.259 --> 59:17.595
That's why I have no pores
or wrinkles at this age.

59:17.679 --> 59:19.138
But what will you do, President Park?

59:19.222 --> 59:20.765
Didn't you say all the time slots
for the ads were sold?

59:20.848 --> 59:23.601
We have plenty of clowns to go on stage.
We'll just cast someone else.

59:23.685 --> 59:25.687
Besides, he's already doing fine
with the ads

59:25.770 --> 59:28.189
Right. What does the content matter?

59:28.273 --> 59:30.024
As long as we have good viewership.

59:30.108 --> 59:31.943
I hope no one else heard that just now.

59:32.026 --> 59:34.946
<i>I will take full responsibility.</i>

59:35.446 --> 59:37.490
<i>In the court where I risked my all,</i>

59:37.574 --> 59:41.286
I will say my last farewell to our people.
I'll see you in a minute then.

59:41.369 --> 59:43.621
So you admit to the suspicions
raised against you?

59:43.705 --> 59:45.748
Please say a word.

59:48.167 --> 59:52.380
Look at him. Does he think
he's Na Hoon-a, Cho Yong-pil,

59:52.463 --> 59:54.549
or Seo Taiji?
Seriously, what's up with him?

59:54.632 --> 59:57.760
Have all the channels
broadcast Kang Yo-han.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.887
And raise our rates for commercials too.

1:00:01.472 --> 1:00:04.225
You're sure quick to sniff out
where there's money.

1:00:04.892 --> 1:00:06.060
<i>Here he comes!</i>

1:00:12.150 --> 1:00:13.192
Judge Kang.

1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:17.155
How could you do this?
We're all in the same team.

1:00:17.238 --> 1:00:18.990
-I'm sorry, Judge Oh.
-She is right.

1:00:19.073 --> 1:00:22.160
We all should take the responsibility.
Let us go up there together.

1:00:22.827 --> 1:00:24.912
There's nothing you have to
take responsibility for.

1:00:24.996 --> 1:00:26.789
Today, I'm going up on stage

1:00:26.873 --> 1:00:29.000
not as a judge, but as the defendant.

1:00:43.723 --> 1:00:46.893
Minister Cha, Judge Kang Yo-han
will be holding a press conference.

1:00:50.897 --> 1:00:51.939
Turn on the TV.

1:00:54.567 --> 1:00:59.113
ANNOUNCEMENT FROM JUDGE KANG

1:00:59.197 --> 1:01:00.114
I…

1:01:01.407 --> 1:01:03.660
have stood here in this court

1:01:03.743 --> 1:01:05.328
with your trust and belief in me.

1:01:06.829 --> 1:01:08.206
But today,

1:01:08.289 --> 1:01:12.293
I stand here
under eyes full of doubt and suspicion.

1:01:13.211 --> 1:01:15.338
<i>The suspicions raised against me</i>

1:01:15.421 --> 1:01:18.466
<i>that I had offered money to the witness
of the wastewater leakage case</i>

1:01:19.258 --> 1:01:20.551
are all true.

1:01:20.635 --> 1:01:23.846
-What?
-Seriously?

1:01:23.930 --> 1:01:24.972
I knew it.

1:01:25.056 --> 1:01:26.724
If that's true…

1:01:26.808 --> 1:01:30.228
<i>My deepest apologies to our people.</i>

1:01:41.489 --> 1:01:43.491
Judge Kang is innocent!

1:01:45.743 --> 1:01:47.578
PRESS CONFERENCE: JUDGE KANG YO-HAN

1:01:54.127 --> 1:01:55.503
Isn't that the witness?

1:02:05.054 --> 1:02:07.932
Everything that I had said in court
are all true.

1:02:08.015 --> 1:02:12.019
Didn't Joo Il-do also admit to
being informed by me?

1:02:12.103 --> 1:02:16.441
<i>It was true I received the report.</i>

1:02:16.524 --> 1:02:19.318
Judge Kang only took pity on me

1:02:20.153 --> 1:02:22.238
and my kids for being…

1:02:23.197 --> 1:02:24.490
forced out onto the streets

1:02:27.326 --> 1:02:29.704
after I was fired from the plant
for whistleblowing.

1:02:30.288 --> 1:02:32.165
He was only helping us. That's all.

1:02:35.835 --> 1:02:37.545
As you can see,

1:02:37.628 --> 1:02:40.173
all the deposits were made
after I was fired from my job.

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:44.427
Judge Kang looked to see whether I was
disadvantaged in any way after the trial.

1:02:45.887 --> 1:02:48.264
<i>He took pity on me and helped me.</i>

1:02:48.347 --> 1:02:51.934
Is that such a crime?

1:02:59.984 --> 1:03:00.943
No.

1:03:01.527 --> 1:03:03.070
Trials are grounded on trust.

1:03:04.197 --> 1:03:05.198
Whatever my motive,

1:03:05.281 --> 1:03:07.492
it is true my actions
aroused misunderstandings.

1:03:08.993 --> 1:03:10.828
Don't feel too burdened by it.

1:03:17.293 --> 1:03:20.755
I ask you now to be my judge.

1:03:21.923 --> 1:03:26.511
Let me place my fate in your hands now.

1:03:27.678 --> 1:03:30.139
<i>If you believe me to be guilty,
press the red button.</i>

1:03:30.223 --> 1:03:32.934
<i>If not, please press the white button.</i>

1:03:34.602 --> 1:03:36.813
If our people will not believe me,

1:03:37.647 --> 1:03:39.106
I will resign

1:03:39.774 --> 1:03:42.735
from my post right here, at this minute.

1:03:52.245 --> 1:03:53.871
POLL ON THE JUDGE KANG'S ISSUE

1:04:20.022 --> 1:04:22.984
NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS: 4.2 MILLION

1:04:23.067 --> 1:04:26.946
INNOCENT

1:04:27.613 --> 1:04:28.614
What…

1:04:39.542 --> 1:04:42.503
If this is the will of our people,
I shall abide by it.

1:04:44.046 --> 1:04:46.382
Thank you, Korea.

1:04:51.470 --> 1:04:52.805
<i>And now…</i>

1:04:53.931 --> 1:04:56.726
I will risk my everything
to expose the truth

1:04:56.809 --> 1:04:59.437
that the powerful have been hiding.

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:01.522
Please take a look at the screen.

1:05:06.277 --> 1:05:08.112
DREAM BASE PROJECT, FILLED WITH HOPE

1:05:13.117 --> 1:05:17.163
DREAM BASE PROJECT, FILLED WITH HOPE

1:05:18.748 --> 1:05:21.584
<i>This is the Dream Base project by the SRF</i>

1:05:21.667 --> 1:05:24.503
for which a nation-wide donation effort
has been carried out.

1:05:24.587 --> 1:05:27.256
But we've received reports
that the project fund

1:05:27.340 --> 1:05:30.718
has been trickling
into some private pockets.

1:05:30.801 --> 1:05:33.846
They are the private pockets
of the key persons of this project.

1:05:41.145 --> 1:05:42.772
SEO JEONG-HAK, CHAIRMAN OF SRF

1:05:42.855 --> 1:05:45.066
HEO JOONG-SE, INCUMBENT PRESIDENT OF KOREA

1:05:47.151 --> 1:05:49.904
CHA GYEONG-HUI,
INCUMBENT MINISTER OF JUSTICE

1:05:56.744 --> 1:05:58.579
PARK DU-MAN,
PRESIDENT OF HMBN PEOPLE MEDIA GROUP

1:05:59.372 --> 1:06:01.165
MIN YONG-SIK, PRESIDENT OF MINBO GROUP

1:06:05.544 --> 1:06:07.588
Hold on.

1:06:08.089 --> 1:06:10.925
Why aren't you airing the ads?
What? There was breaking news?

1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:27.608
I will reward you handsomely
out of my own pocket

1:06:27.692 --> 1:06:31.779
if you come forward with information
about where your donations are going

1:06:31.862 --> 1:06:34.657
and what the real purpose
behind this project is.

1:06:34.740 --> 1:06:36.450
I promise.

1:06:36.534 --> 1:06:37.618
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:06:40.913 --> 1:06:42.581
Hold on. Hey!

1:06:43.165 --> 1:06:44.125
Secretary Park!

1:07:16.198 --> 1:07:20.119
THANK YOU TO JUNG JAE-SUNG
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:07:48.064 --> 1:07:49.857
<i>It should be fun at least.</i>

1:07:50.566 --> 1:07:51.901
<i>I'm getting cornered anyway.</i>

1:07:51.984 --> 1:07:54.361
-Anxious, are you?
-I will take care of it.

1:07:55.613 --> 1:07:57.782
They're just ungrounded suspicions.

1:07:57.865 --> 1:07:58.824
<i>Discord.</i>

1:07:59.617 --> 1:08:00.659
<i>I need to shake them up first.</i>

1:08:00.743 --> 1:08:02.870
<i>You just waged war against the country.</i>

1:08:02.953 --> 1:08:04.371
This is war.

1:08:04.455 --> 1:08:06.957
<i>A brave informant has come forward for us.</i>

1:08:07.041 --> 1:08:09.168
This is the story of his parents.

1:08:09.251 --> 1:08:10.711
Don't you dare speak like that!

1:08:10.795 --> 1:08:13.923
I see you were extremely
touched by the stern ruling of the law

1:08:14.006 --> 1:08:15.841
on that fraud who killed your parents.

1:08:15.925 --> 1:08:18.886
You torture them to death

1:08:18.969 --> 1:08:20.971
<i>Do you want to see me losing it?</i>

1:08:23.140 --> 1:08:27.770
