Oh, yeah!
Hey, guys.

00:37.750 --> 00:40.542
What's so funny?
You talking about last night's
How I Met Your Mother?

00:40.583 --> 00:42.750
I love that Barney guy.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.208
"Get your suit on!"
What a catchphrase.

00:45.250 --> 00:48.583
No, Stan.
We were out last night
partying-- hard.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.583
Oh, man.
Remember that dental
hygienist we met?

00:51.625 --> 00:54.000
Spit and rinse!

00:54.041 --> 00:56.709
Yeah!
I wish
I knew what that meant.

00:56.750 --> 00:59.834
Stan, why don't you
come out with us sometime?
We're doing it again tonight.

00:59.875 --> 01:02.083
Ah, I promised Francine
I'd come home.

01:02.125 --> 01:04.709
She says we have some cheese
I have to finish, or it's
gonna go bad.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.917
Come on!
Blow her off!

01:06.959 --> 01:10.834
I wish, but I made a promise.
And Stan Smith has never
broken a promise.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.917
You know it's true, Gil.

01:12.959 --> 01:17.875
It is so hot in here.

01:17.917 --> 01:21.250
Well, you're missing out, Stan.
I'd say we'll think of you,
but we won't.

01:21.291 --> 01:23.417
It was at my expense,

01:23.458 --> 01:25.583
but I'm sharing
in the laughter!

01:25.625 --> 01:29.208
Part of the group!
I'm part of the group!
And now I'm alone.

01:29.250 --> 01:32.750
Hey, you don't need them.
You're the coolest agent here.

01:32.792 --> 01:35.125
Really?
Yeah, really.

01:35.166 --> 01:37.709
Will you buy $60
worth of licorice
from my daughter?

01:37.750 --> 01:39.500
She wants to play soccer
in Europe.

01:43.417 --> 01:46.291
I just had my colors done,
and Lydia tells me
I'm an autumn.

01:46.333 --> 01:49.291
Roger, I've been standing
with you here the whole time.

01:49.333 --> 01:52.083
You haven't talked to anybody,
and you're putting lipstick
on your eyelids.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.709
You're just jealous.
You know, if you fixed
yourself up a little,

01:54.750 --> 01:57.000
men would find you
attractive too.

01:57.041 --> 02:00.375
Instead of wondering
if you're in the middle of
gender-reassignment surgery.

02:00.417 --> 02:03.542
Please. Men find me
way more attractive than you.

02:03.583 --> 02:07.166
Oh, yeah?
Five El Pollo Loco coupons
says you're wrong.

02:07.208 --> 02:09.750
- You're on.
- Damn right I'm on.
I'm on fire.

02:09.834 --> 02:12.375
Whoops. Nip slip.

02:28.083 --> 02:31.083
They're not smiling back
at me because they think
you're my husband.

02:35.166 --> 02:40.125
All right now.
It's time for Bernie's
gardening tip of the week.

02:40.166 --> 02:43.333
If you want to start
your lawn mower
on the first pull,

02:43.375 --> 02:46.291
here's a trick
most people do not know.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.750
You stand on the back tires
of the mower...

02:49.792 --> 02:53.166
and pull the cord
straight towards your chest.

02:53.208 --> 02:56.083
It starts the first time
every time.

02:58.291 --> 03:00.500
I think I want another
plate of mac and cheese.

03:00.542 --> 03:02.458
How about a plate of my nads
and cheese!

03:02.500 --> 03:05.291
Stan, how explosive!
What's going on?

03:05.333 --> 03:07.333
I'll tell you
what's going on.

03:07.375 --> 03:11.208
All the guys at work
get to go out and have fun while
I'm stuck here every night.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.625
"Stuck here"?
Stan, if you want
to go out, go out.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.834
I'll have a nice
evening alone--

03:16.875 --> 03:19.875
Curl up with a book,
maybe write a song.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.500
There's my melody.
I'm halfway there.

03:24.542 --> 03:26.875
I'm gonna do
man stuff tonight!

03:31.458 --> 03:33.542
Who could sing this?

03:33.583 --> 03:36.667
Avril Lavigne!
She sucks!

03:36.709 --> 03:40.583
This thong gives me
an ass rash,
but the boys love it.

03:40.625 --> 03:43.208
Give it up, Roger.
You're not more
attractive than me.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.583
No one smiled at either
of us at the mall today.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.250
You guys were at the mall?
Maybe this is about you.

03:48.291 --> 03:51.291
It's a "missed connections"
posting on Craigslist.

03:51.333 --> 03:54.583
"You-- cute brunette
with friend at mall
next to hat kiosk.

03:54.625 --> 03:57.458
Me-- too shy to say hello."

03:57.500 --> 04:00.709
I was the cute brunette
at the mall!
He's talking about me!

04:00.750 --> 04:03.667
How do you know
that I'm not cute
and you're friend?

04:03.709 --> 04:05.917
He says to meet him tonight
at the food court.

04:05.959 --> 04:07.959
He'll be wearing
a green sweater.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.041
Oh, you should both go.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.667
The one he walks up to
is the cute one.

04:12.709 --> 04:16.083
Okay. We'll go.
And this time, Hayley, we'll
prove who's more of a woman.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.041
Roger, did you draw
that on?

04:20.083 --> 04:22.125
Yes. Aroused?

04:22.166 --> 04:23.750
Uh--
Well, it's not for you!

04:27.208 --> 04:30.709
Did someone order a spot-on
Rosie Perez impersonator?

04:30.750 --> 04:32.291
Whoa!
Whoa!

04:32.333 --> 04:34.709
No way!
Look who escaped.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.542
Went to the A.T.M.,
busted out my $40 quick cash.

04:37.583 --> 04:40.583
I got my comb.
I'm ready to party.

04:40.625 --> 04:43.166
My friends, I would like
to make a toast.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.667
To Stan getting away
from his wife for the night,

04:45.709 --> 04:49.083
and me getting away
from mine... forever!

04:49.125 --> 04:51.875
Yep, my divorce
from Sheila
became final today.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.500
I'm a free man!

04:53.542 --> 04:55.583
Yeah!

04:55.625 --> 04:59.834
She got it all--
the house, the car,
even the dog.

04:59.875 --> 05:02.792
Ungrateful mutt.
And I'm talking about Sheila.

05:02.834 --> 05:05.625
I thought it was the dog
you were talking about.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.959
You were talking about
your ex-wife.
I know, I know.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.500
It was a joke, and I got it.
I'm one of the guys.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.917
Nathan! Stop it!

05:16.959 --> 05:19.792
This is why you keep
getting molested.

05:26.041 --> 05:28.041
Okay, let's whip 'em out.

05:28.083 --> 05:30.709
- Our wieners?
- No. Our credit cards.

05:30.750 --> 05:34.458
It's credit card roulette.
Whoever loses pays the bill.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.250
The whole bill?
That's four times
what I was expecting to spend!

05:38.291 --> 05:40.500
Yeah, it's a total rush.

05:43.917 --> 05:45.709
Do us the honor,
would you?

05:47.166 --> 05:49.417
- Dick Reynolds?
- Oh!

05:49.458 --> 05:51.583
Yeah!

05:51.625 --> 05:54.667
Oh, my God! When she pulled out
that card, it looked
exactly like my card.

05:54.709 --> 05:56.959
But then it wasn't my card!
It wasn't my card at all!

05:57.000 --> 05:59.041
It was Dick's card.
Now Dick has to pay.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.291
Okay. Everyone ready
to go to the cigar bar?

06:01.333 --> 06:03.875
Two places in one night?
You guys are wild!

06:03.917 --> 06:06.792
So, you guys keeping
this party going?

06:06.834 --> 06:08.875
Nathan!

06:08.917 --> 06:11.917
Stogies! Stogies! Stogies!

06:11.959 --> 06:15.250
Stogies!
I am so glad
I came out tonight.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.291
Better than sitting at home
with the wife, bored out of my--

06:19.291 --> 06:22.583
Ah! I have a guy
who can fix this right up.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.667
I'll pay
for the whole thing.
Ah, that's great,

06:24.709 --> 06:26.750
but I still have to
report it to my insurance.

06:26.792 --> 06:29.125
Oh, sure.
I understand.

06:29.166 --> 06:32.291
Let me get my info.
I really appreciate you--
Ow!

06:32.333 --> 06:35.166
- Oh, my God!
- Dick, what the hell?

06:35.208 --> 06:38.250
I've got three D.U.I.s, Stan.
One more, and they take away
my license.

06:38.291 --> 06:41.500
Oh! Ow!

06:41.542 --> 06:44.667
What are you doing?
You can't leave him here.
He'll call the cops.

06:44.709 --> 06:48.542
I'm not gonna let this jackass
ruin our night.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.500
Please! Don't do this!

06:50.542 --> 06:53.333
You guys, we have to take
this man to the hospital.

06:53.375 --> 06:56.625
And lose our buzz?
Come on!
The night's just begun!

06:56.667 --> 06:58.917
Yeah. We're just
getting started.

06:58.959 --> 07:01.375
Oh, please.
I think I have a concussion.

07:01.417 --> 07:03.917
What if I fall asleep?
I could die in here.

07:03.959 --> 07:07.125
You can't worry about
"what ifs," friend.
You gotta live in the moment.

07:14.166 --> 07:17.333
Ah! Nothing more relaxing
than a nice cigar.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.917
Look, guys, we have
to get that man
to a hospital.

07:19.959 --> 07:23.834
Relax, Stan!
This kind of thing
happens all the time.

07:23.875 --> 07:27.417
Yeah, last week
we snuck into the zoo,
and Sanders fought a panda.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.625
That's where I got this.

07:31.959 --> 07:34.792
You know, I heard they shot
Cilantro's "El Perro" video
in the bathroom.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.792
Uh, gonna go check it out.

07:46.458 --> 07:49.417
Hang tough in there, buddy.
I'm gonna get you to a hospital.
I promise.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.750
You know why
I pulled you over.
Did I forget to signal?

07:59.792 --> 08:02.166
You're missing
the front portion
of your vehicle, sir.

08:03.875 --> 08:07.208
Well, I could be missing
the bottom portion
of my clothes,

08:07.250 --> 08:10.250
if that would get me off
with a warning.

08:10.291 --> 08:12.291
Help!

08:12.333 --> 08:14.417
Did I just hear someone
yell from your trunk?

08:14.458 --> 08:16.458
Um, I have
a ventriloquist act.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.542
But instead of a dummy,
I use a car.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.291
It's hard to book gigs.
Most stages can't
accommodate a car,

08:21.333 --> 08:24.125
but I'm an artist,
so that's the life I chose.

08:24.166 --> 08:25.959
Sir, get out of the car
and open the trunk.

08:31.166 --> 08:33.834
Dick, that's an officer
of the law!

08:33.875 --> 08:35.917
Ow!
What's wrong
with you?

08:35.959 --> 08:37.959
Don't you know
how to knock a guy out?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.583
Yeah, you knock out guys
like a girl.
Oh, yeah?

08:40.625 --> 08:44.250
Do I mess up hair like a girl?
Do I mess up hair like a girl?
Hey, come on!

08:44.291 --> 08:47.458
Dick, don't! Dick.
Come on, Dick.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.917
Why are you
doing this, Dick?
This isn't you.

08:49.959 --> 08:54.083
I want the old Dick back.
I don't want bad, new Dick.
I want good, old Dick.

08:54.125 --> 08:56.834
Give me the Dick I'm used to.
Give me the Dick I love!

08:56.875 --> 08:59.542
Guys, knock it off!

09:02.625 --> 09:05.625
H-H-Hey, a trunk buddy!

09:05.667 --> 09:08.500
So, do you like 30 Rock?

09:08.542 --> 09:10.458
Shut up!

09:10.500 --> 09:12.625
Yeah, I'm a fan.

09:18.542 --> 09:22.709
Okay. My knight
in shimmering green sweater
is gonna be here any minute.

09:22.750 --> 09:26.166
Damn it. Damn thong.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.792
I really should not be
shaking anyone's hand.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.834
Ooh, there he is!

09:32.417 --> 09:36.458
Oh, he's a looker!
Don't stare at him.
Sit. Sit.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.583
Get used to that, dog.

09:47.542 --> 09:49.625
Hi. I'm Tyler.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.792
I'm Amber.
Give me waves
of grain alcohol,

09:52.834 --> 09:55.917
and we'll see how purple
your majesty gets.

09:55.959 --> 09:58.250
What?
It's from a song.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.667
We really saved you
back there, Stan.

10:05.709 --> 10:08.375
We have two men
bleeding to death
in the trunk.

10:08.417 --> 10:10.375
Let's just get them
to the hospital,

10:10.417 --> 10:13.083
unload them in front
and drive away.
Okay, if it'll shut you--

10:13.125 --> 10:16.250
I'm fine!
Dick, are-- Are you crying?

10:16.291 --> 10:19.125
No! It's nothing!

10:19.166 --> 10:21.709
Dick says it's nothing.
So to get to the hospital,
make a left--

10:21.750 --> 10:26.750
I miss my dog!
Biscuit!
I miss Biscuit!

10:26.792 --> 10:29.542
She took him.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.667
Dick, no.
The hospital's the other way.

10:31.709 --> 10:33.583
I'm coming to get you,
Biscuit!

10:39.291 --> 10:42.875
Dick, come on. We gotta get
those guys to the hospital.

10:42.917 --> 10:45.000
Damn it!
Sheila changed the locks.

10:48.458 --> 10:51.875
Okay. You take the front.
I'll take the back.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.542
- Cheese and crackers!
- That hurt!

10:56.583 --> 11:00.667
Dick? You get out of here
right now, or I'm calling
the police!

11:00.709 --> 11:03.917
I'm takin' the damn dog, Sheila!
Don't try to stop me!

11:03.959 --> 11:05.625
- Sheila?
- Who are you talking to?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.333
Al?

11:08.375 --> 11:10.834
That's right.
I'm nailing your barber.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.667
You're a dead man, Al!

11:13.875 --> 11:16.709
Stop it!

11:16.750 --> 11:19.500
Leave him alone!
This ain't the first time
I fought naked!

11:21.667 --> 11:23.834
Now that's how
you knock a guy out.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.208
Bring him back,
you monsters!

11:30.250 --> 11:33.750
Oh! He's naked.
Can't you put him in
the other way?

11:33.792 --> 11:36.875
Don't worry, guys.
I'm gonna get you out of this.
I promise.

11:36.917 --> 11:39.000
Where are you going,
you mug?

11:39.041 --> 11:42.208
Sheila, since we're not
going to be social anymore,
I feel I can tell you this.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.959
I'm the one who clogged
the toilet on your houseboat.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.709
Roger, don't you
look beautiful.

11:51.750 --> 11:54.875
Tyler invited me
to a party tonight.
Semiformal.

11:54.917 --> 11:57.875
I envy you, Hayley.
Never having to worry...

11:57.917 --> 12:02.041
about things like
panty hose or contraception.

12:02.083 --> 12:05.333
No babies for me.

We were known as
"the pretty house."

12:16.041 --> 12:18.250
Then crystal meth
got its hooks into us.

I was just selling it.

Whoa, Stan.
You don't pull a gun
on a bro.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.667
That's right.
Stan, if you want to put
that gun to good use,

14:24.709 --> 14:26.583
then shoot my hooker's
penis off.

14:26.625 --> 14:29.375

14:29.417 --> 14:30.750
Hey, look.
It's Misty.

14:33.625 --> 14:38.208
Oh, no! She stole Dick's car.
Those guys are in the trunk!

14:38.250 --> 14:40.250
You knew about me?

14:40.291 --> 14:42.542
I knew the whole time.

14:46.709 --> 14:50.291
This is bad. This is bad.
This is bad. Those guys were in
the trunk. What are we gonna do?

14:50.333 --> 14:53.125
I have LoJack.
We can find out
where she took my car.

14:57.959 --> 15:00.542
Fernando Jaramillo.

15:00.583 --> 15:03.083
Oh, my God!
Good. We all know
who he is,

15:03.125 --> 15:05.417
so we don't have to waste
any time explaining it
to each other.

15:05.458 --> 15:08.500
I don't know who he is.
Oh, well, let me
explain it to you.

15:08.542 --> 15:12.583
Jaramillo is the most
ruthless killer and crime lord
on the Eastern Seaboard.

15:12.625 --> 15:15.875
But why would the hooker
take your car
to this guy?

15:15.917 --> 15:18.417
Probably to sell it
'cause Dick refused
to pay her.

15:18.458 --> 15:20.542
Dick don't pay
for strange.
You know that.

15:20.583 --> 15:23.458
Look at my mug.

15:23.500 --> 15:26.250
When Jaramillo finds
a cop in the trunk,
he'll kill them all.

15:26.291 --> 15:28.291
So, we're good?

15:28.333 --> 15:31.583
No! We gotta get 'em back!
And I'm not going
in there alone.

15:31.625 --> 15:34.458
All you do is
bitch and moan
and pull guns on us.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.166
You suck, Stan.
Hold on now.

15:37.208 --> 15:39.583
I have
one more question.

15:39.625 --> 15:42.667
How old do you boys
think I am?
Uh, 55?

15:42.709 --> 15:44.000
Fifty-seven.

15:53.834 --> 15:55.709
Biscuit comin' in hot!

16:00.542 --> 16:03.458
What a spread.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.375
Looks like you want
to spread 'em
for Jaramillo.

16:18.792 --> 16:22.583
They're gone.
They must be dead!
So, we're good?

16:29.375 --> 16:31.333
I promised
I'd come back for you.

16:39.917 --> 16:44.750
Hello. You are trespassing
on my property.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.417
C.I.A.

16:46.458 --> 16:50.375
C.I.A. Very impressive.

17:01.583 --> 17:03.709
Thank you
for my new belt buckle.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.000
Those are like 50 bucks
to replace.

17:06.041 --> 17:10.208
You four, get out.
These three men
belong to me.

17:10.250 --> 17:13.083
I bought the car,
and they were in the trunk.

17:13.125 --> 17:15.375
This was also in the trunk,
so it is also mine.

17:16.792 --> 17:19.583
- My beach supplies!
- Are you gonna kill us?

17:19.625 --> 17:23.166
Yes. In addition
to chopping cars for parts,

17:23.208 --> 17:25.834
I've also started
chopping humans.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.917
Want to know the irony?

17:27.959 --> 17:31.625
I sell hearts,
but I've never been in love.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.625
I'm not leaving
without those guys.

17:33.667 --> 17:35.667
Then you are
not leaving.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.750
Stan, it's over.
There's nothing
you can do.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.959
Oh, really?
Now, Biscuit!

17:49.041 --> 17:52.125
You think I'd come in here
without a plan "B"?

17:52.166 --> 17:53.834
Now, Cheesers!

17:55.041 --> 17:57.083
Coward! I gave you
everything!

17:59.834 --> 18:03.291
It starts the first time
every time.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.250
Are you a betting man?
Go on.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.375
You see that lawn mower
over there?

18:09.417 --> 18:12.542
If I can start it
10 times in a row
without a single stall,

18:12.583 --> 18:14.291
then you set them free.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.959
And if you don't,
I cut off your leg
with that chain saw.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.500
Okay, we have that.
Put a pin in it.

18:20.542 --> 18:24.917
Or-- and get ready for this--
I will give you
a free Tarot card reading.

18:24.959 --> 18:28.125
Huh? Know your future.

18:28.166 --> 18:31.667
What mysteries does
the deck hold for you?

18:31.709 --> 18:34.291
Nah. I want your leg.
Suit yourself.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.583
Stan, don't do this.
This is crazy!

18:36.625 --> 18:38.959
Trust me. I know a little
something about lawn mowers.

18:48.041 --> 18:50.542
Give it a sec.

18:50.583 --> 18:53.125
Ring-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh--
There it goes.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.542
Duh-duh-duh-duh--
She's a beaut.
Duh-duh-duh-duh--

18:55.583 --> 18:58.834
What'd you pay for her?
Duh-duh-duh-duh, duh, duh--
Oh, I'm out of gas.

18:58.875 --> 19:03.000
Escort these three
off of my property.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.500
Bye, boys.
It was a memorable night.

19:06.875 --> 19:09.083
It was a real honor
partyin' with you, Stan.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.125
It's over, Biscuit.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.792
Okay, hop up.

19:17.834 --> 19:20.000
I already have a buyer
for your leg.

19:20.041 --> 19:23.041
I'm going to shave it
and sell it to Heather Mills.

19:32.583 --> 19:35.333
What are you doing here?
I thought you were
at a party with Tyler.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.333
He turned out to be
a real jerk.

19:37.375 --> 19:39.291
And it made me realize
something--

19:39.333 --> 19:41.417
I was a real jerk to you.

19:41.458 --> 19:43.500
We shouldn't be
fighting each other.

19:43.542 --> 19:46.625
It's ridiculous to let
other people judge us
based on how we look.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.208
Well, thanks, Roger.
What do you say
I go change...

19:49.250 --> 19:52.250
and take you out
for an apology drink?
You're on.

19:53.542 --> 19:55.417
Roger, why are we at
a frat--

19:55.458 --> 19:58.500
Hi, everybody. Is this hog
a blue ribbon or what?

19:58.542 --> 20:01.125

20:01.166 --> 20:03.250

Relax.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.667
I don't expect to win.
I'm just hoping to place.

20:11.583 --> 20:14.125
- Stan!
- What are you
so surprised about?

20:14.166 --> 20:18.291
You left me with a guy who was
about to cut my leg off. What'd
you think was gonna happen?

20:25.375 --> 20:27.000
Ah!

20:27.041 --> 20:29.000
Dude, how did you
get out of that?

20:29.041 --> 20:30.875
Cheesers came back.

20:30.917 --> 20:32.583
You are a legend.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.834
You gotta come out
with us again tonight!

20:34.875 --> 20:38.333
Sorry, boys.
I've got better
places to be.

20:40.208 --> 20:42.250
Yeah, there it is.

20:42.291 --> 20:44.792

20:46.917 --> 20:49.208

to call Bernie with your
gardening questions.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.333
Hello? Line one,
you're on with Bernie.

20:55.375 --> 20:57.166
You son of a bitch,
I'm gonna kill you.

20:57.208 --> 20:59.417
I'm gonna finish
this meat loaf,

20:59.458 --> 21:02.208
get on a plane to Toronto,
