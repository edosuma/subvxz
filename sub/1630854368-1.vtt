WEBVTT

00:00.194 --> 00:04.694
(police radio transmits indistinctly)

00:30.032 --> 00:32.320
- All right, Jimenes,

00:32.320 --> 00:34.140
Would you rather wake up

00:34.140 --> 00:35.250
every morning -
- Already?

00:35.250 --> 00:37.020
You wanna start with that already?

00:37.020 --> 00:38.870
- It's just a way to get to know you.

00:39.990 --> 00:42.023
See what type of man you are.

00:43.470 --> 00:47.550
So would you rather wake up with cabbage,

00:47.550 --> 00:50.872
two big things of cabbage
on your hands every morning

00:50.872 --> 00:51.705
and you have to eat 'em all

00:51.705 --> 00:53.583
before you can even start your day?

00:54.540 --> 00:57.330
Or would you rather have a little midget

00:57.330 --> 00:59.670
that follows you around
but fucks with you,

00:59.670 --> 01:03.060
like turns out the lights
when you're taking a shower

01:03.060 --> 01:05.820
or mismatches your socks,
locks your keys in your car

01:05.820 --> 01:07.110
when you're not paying attention.

01:07.110 --> 01:07.943
Which one?

01:10.290 --> 01:12.253
- I will say I fucking hate cabbage.

01:12.253 --> 01:13.710
I don't like cabbage.

01:13.710 --> 01:15.360
It's gross.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.980
Little Midget,

01:16.980 --> 01:18.000
I feel like I already had that shit,

01:18.000 --> 01:19.740
'cause that shit always
happens to me, man.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.913
So think I'll do the midget.

01:21.913 --> 01:23.613
- All right.
- Yeah, I'll settle with that.

01:23.613 --> 01:26.233
- That was an easy one,
that was an easy one.

01:28.277 --> 01:30.027
All right, all right.

01:31.120 --> 01:34.600
Would you rather be at San Quentin

01:35.700 --> 01:38.680
with the craziest serial raper

01:40.139 --> 01:41.277
of all time?
- But what's San Quentin?

01:41.277 --> 01:43.500
- San Quentin?
- What is that?

01:43.500 --> 01:44.333
- Really?

01:45.270 --> 01:49.110
Like one of the worst fricking
jail or prisons on earth.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.310
- Oh, okay, I was testing you,

01:50.310 --> 01:52.355
I was testing you to see
if you knew what that was.

01:52.355 --> 01:53.343
- Boy.

01:53.343 --> 01:54.176
Oh boy.

01:55.010 --> 01:57.330
Okay, would you rather be in there

01:57.330 --> 01:58.980
with like this craziest rapist guy

01:58.980 --> 02:01.410
and like once a month he's
gonna have his way with you

02:01.410 --> 02:04.407
and there's nothing you
can do at all, like -

02:05.370 --> 02:06.720
but it's only once a month.

02:08.556 --> 02:10.110
- Okay, what's the other option?

02:10.110 --> 02:15.110
- Or would you rather go viral on TikTok,

02:15.750 --> 02:17.400
everybody in the world's gonna see it,

02:17.400 --> 02:19.590
there's gonna be memes after this,

02:19.590 --> 02:23.010
you walk outside and somebody pranks you

02:23.010 --> 02:25.200
by throwing shit at your door
and it's filled with dildos

02:25.200 --> 02:26.970
and while you're trying
to smash the shit out,

02:26.970 --> 02:28.320
dildos are just falling from the sky

02:28.320 --> 02:29.804
and hitting you in the face everywhere.

02:29.804 --> 02:31.530
(Jimenes laughs)
And it goes viral.

02:31.530 --> 02:32.363
Everybody's gonna see it.

02:32.363 --> 02:33.647
- Where do you get this shit?

02:33.647 --> 02:34.650
Is this what you're always thinking about?

02:34.650 --> 02:35.483
- Yeah.
- This is what you're

02:35.483 --> 02:36.963
always thinking about, wow, okay.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.809
- Well, do you see a lot going on?

02:39.809 --> 02:42.597
- I'll go with the -

02:44.201 --> 02:45.457
Fuck, man, I don't know,

02:45.457 --> 02:49.650
go with dildos.

02:49.650 --> 02:51.210
- Viral, dildos and shit
- Viral, I'll be known

02:51.210 --> 02:53.825
- just smacking you.
- for the dildo guy.

02:53.825 --> 02:54.658
- Okay.
- Yeah. Why not? Fuck it.

02:57.162 --> 02:58.262
Fuck it.

02:58.262 --> 03:03.262
So, being on the force for two weeks now,

03:07.380 --> 03:09.840
what do you guys normally do?

03:09.840 --> 03:13.053
- This is it, drive around,

03:14.370 --> 03:16.353
parking tickets, pulling people over.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.050
I mean, it's not a glamorous job.

03:19.050 --> 03:21.060
It's not like what you see on Cops.

03:21.060 --> 03:23.340
There's not a bunch of shit going on.

03:23.340 --> 03:24.660
Nobody's really chasing us.

03:24.660 --> 03:26.310
We're not really chasing anybody.

03:28.635 --> 03:30.030
I mean.

03:30.030 --> 03:31.770
We'll probably pull somebody over tonight

03:31.770 --> 03:33.033
for something boring.

03:35.190 --> 03:36.340
Who knows what that is.

03:37.620 --> 03:38.940
I hope we don't pull anybody over

03:38.940 --> 03:40.726
'cause I don't feel like doing paperwork.

03:40.726 --> 03:42.000
(Jimenes laughs)

03:42.000 --> 03:45.300
I'm just saying.
- I, I agree.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.837
But I'm kind of excited though, you know?

03:47.837 --> 03:49.383
First, well, first stop.

03:50.820 --> 03:53.248
Tired of all the fucking office work.

03:53.248 --> 03:55.383
All that desk work, it's just, killer man.

03:56.883 --> 03:58.283
Have you ever fallen asleep?

03:59.340 --> 04:01.140
- Oh yeah, I take naps all the time.

04:02.370 --> 04:03.977
I mean, if you weren't
here, I'd probably pull

04:03.977 --> 04:07.671
down one of these streets
and take a nap right now.

04:07.671 --> 04:08.671
No big deal.

04:10.005 --> 04:11.580
Now that you're here I
can take a nap all day

04:11.580 --> 04:14.103
and you can just drive around.

04:16.927 --> 04:19.427
(static ping)

04:23.250 --> 04:25.250
- That's kinda strange, don't you think?

04:27.790 --> 04:29.123
- Text the wife.

04:30.090 --> 04:30.930
You married?

04:30.930 --> 04:32.190
Kids, anything?
- No.

04:32.190 --> 04:33.663
No, no kids, no kids.

04:35.550 --> 04:37.713
Married once though, yeah, married once.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.993
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:41.798 --> 04:42.683
- How did that go?

04:44.537 --> 04:47.109
- Huh? Not married anymore.

04:47.109 --> 04:48.960
(both chuckle)

04:48.960 --> 04:51.856
- Yeah, I've been married
for about five years now.

04:51.856 --> 04:52.689
- Kids?

04:52.689 --> 04:57.497
- Yeah, I got two kids, but I
mean, it's a bunch of babies.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.790
- I bet that's awesome,
though, man, to have kids?

05:02.790 --> 05:05.280
- It's cool, I mean, the
wife hates me being a cop.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.617
She wants me to do a safer job, I'm like,

05:08.699 --> 05:09.600
(Jimenes chuckles)

05:09.600 --> 05:10.950
This seems pretty safe, right?

05:10.950 --> 05:12.153
- Pretty safe, yeah.

05:22.260 --> 05:24.897
She's just asking like,
"How's your partner?"

05:26.920 --> 05:28.050
(Jimenes chuckles)

05:28.050 --> 05:31.740
- So have you had a partner before or?

05:31.740 --> 05:33.240
- Yeah, I mean, they usually choose me

05:33.240 --> 05:34.350
to do on-the-job training.

05:34.350 --> 05:35.183
- Got you.

05:36.930 --> 05:37.800
- Apparently I have a knack

05:37.800 --> 05:39.753
for walking the new guys through.

05:43.470 --> 05:44.303
Not too bad.

05:48.510 --> 05:49.560
- So this is it, huh?

05:50.490 --> 05:52.790
- Nobody's speeding, you
can't make 'em speed.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.376
You hungry?

06:01.376 --> 06:03.210
- I am hungry, actually.

06:03.210 --> 06:04.547
- All right, where are we?

06:05.430 --> 06:06.930
No speedsters today.

06:06.930 --> 06:08.820
Lunchtime.

06:08.820 --> 06:11.028
Even though we've only
been on duty for two hours.

06:11.028 --> 06:12.828
(Jimenes chuckles)
But I am hungry.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.470
- [Server] Jimmy's, how
can I get you started?

06:28.470 --> 06:31.773
- Can, let me ask you, does the
number one come with onions?

06:33.234 --> 06:34.543
- [Server] You said a number
one combo with medium fries?

06:34.543 --> 06:38.125
- No, I said does the
number one come with onions?

06:38.125 --> 06:41.127
- [Server] Oh, a number
one with a slushie?

06:41.127 --> 06:43.367
- No, does it come with onions?

06:43.367 --> 06:45.101
- [Server] Oh, number one with
no onions, I'm so sorry sir.

06:45.101 --> 06:46.101
- Oh my god.

06:47.409 --> 06:49.350
- Hold on one second.

06:49.350 --> 06:51.270
- I'm sorry, can you hear me?

06:51.270 --> 06:52.680
- [Server] Kinda, can you
speak up a little bit louder?

06:52.680 --> 06:53.513
I'm so sorry.

06:54.420 --> 06:56.283
- Does the number, sorry,

06:58.260 --> 07:00.333
does the number one come with onions?

07:01.525 --> 07:02.760
- [Server] Does the number
one come with onions?

07:02.760 --> 07:03.593
- Yes.

07:03.593 --> 07:05.855
- [Server] Yeah, do you
want me to take it off?

07:05.855 --> 07:08.770
- Yeah, let's take off the onions.

07:08.770 --> 07:10.973
- [Server] Okay.
- Does it come with lettuce?

07:13.740 --> 07:15.210
- What, are you kidding me?

07:15.210 --> 07:17.073
What are you talking about?

07:17.073 --> 07:17.906
- I don't know, I -

07:17.906 --> 07:21.183
- Hey man, just give us two
number ones with Sprites.

07:24.597 --> 07:29.597
With everything on, just two
number ones with Sprites.

07:30.780 --> 07:31.930
Did you lose your mind?

07:32.907 --> 07:34.860
I don't like onions, so.

07:34.860 --> 07:36.040
You want them to spit in our food?

07:36.040 --> 07:37.647
(Jimenes chuckles)

07:37.647 --> 07:39.960
Did you catch that, boss?

07:39.960 --> 07:40.830
Except for these pictures,

07:40.830 --> 07:41.670
go slide.
- Fucking hate

07:41.670 --> 07:42.503
these things, man.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.554
You, you comfortable with these things on?

07:44.554 --> 07:46.793
- No, 'cause they can
see everything I'm doing.

07:49.110 --> 07:51.933
The only cool thing is if I
prop my head up like this,

07:52.800 --> 07:54.870
you don't know if I'm awake or asleep.

07:54.870 --> 07:56.070
- Oh, that's true, yeah.

07:57.827 --> 08:00.240
- They're just gonna
look at me. (chuckles)

08:00.240 --> 08:01.627
Don't look at me, puppet.

08:01.627 --> 08:03.000
(Jimenes chuckles)

08:03.000 --> 08:04.530
- So, what, it's live feed going directly

08:04.530 --> 08:08.390
to like Headquarters or what?

08:08.390 --> 08:10.020
- That's what I've heard.

08:10.020 --> 08:12.240
I've never actually seen
where the footage goes.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.290
- Oh.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.090
- I don't actually care,

08:15.090 --> 08:18.453
because I don't really do anything.

08:19.980 --> 08:20.813
- I mean, our -
- I guess

08:20.813 --> 08:22.350
if you're doing something
wrong, then worry about it.

08:22.350 --> 08:26.370
- Yeah, I mean, our job is
to control the situation.

08:26.370 --> 08:27.543
Don't lose your head.

08:29.070 --> 08:32.340
When I was in the Marines,
that's all it is, muscle memory.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.050
Everything is muscle memory.

08:34.050 --> 08:36.183
You're still new, but you'll pick it up.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.680
You'll learn when and
when not to draw your gun,

08:40.680 --> 08:41.903
when to use your taser.

08:43.473 --> 08:44.820
Have you used a taser before?

08:44.820 --> 08:47.405
- I have, yeah, yeah,
I did at the Academy.

08:47.405 --> 08:51.756
I had to get my ass tased
before I could grab it. (laughs)

08:51.756 --> 08:52.633
So yeah.
- That shit hurts, huh?

08:52.633 --> 08:53.633
- Yeah.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.053
I think I pissed myself.

09:03.434 --> 09:06.630
(police radio transmitting)
- Okay.

09:06.630 --> 09:11.320
Would you rather have the
worst explosive diarrhea

09:12.180 --> 09:14.433
any time anybody sneezes around you?

09:16.020 --> 09:17.880
- Like the sneeze triggers

09:17.880 --> 09:18.747
- Yeah. You hear,
- Diarrhea?

09:18.747 --> 09:19.770
- you hear somebody sneezing,

09:19.770 --> 09:21.300
you're just like (mimicked
explosive sound).

09:21.300 --> 09:23.043
- You know what I, okay, or?

09:23.968 --> 09:26.610
- Or would you rather get attacked

09:26.610 --> 09:29.190
by a hundred hornets once a month?

09:29.190 --> 09:30.420
- Oh, fuck no.

09:30.420 --> 09:31.253
Diarrhea.

09:31.253 --> 09:32.703
- You like the diarrhea?
- Yeah.

09:33.780 --> 09:34.613
I wasn't gonna -

09:34.613 --> 09:36.859
I'm all over the ass play, man.

09:36.859 --> 09:37.770
(both laugh)

09:37.770 --> 09:39.120
From dildos to this.

09:41.724 --> 09:46.474
(police radio transmitting indistinctly)

09:49.750 --> 09:54.167
- (grunts) Let's light this dude up.

09:55.783 --> 09:59.033
(police siren wailing)

10:00.661 --> 10:02.194
Where's he going?

10:02.194 --> 10:03.444
- I don't know.

10:05.970 --> 10:06.933
Not sketchy at all.

10:08.388 --> 10:11.520
- Just keep your head
on a swivel, all right?

10:11.520 --> 10:12.520
Just follow my lead.

10:18.838 --> 10:20.249
- I don't like this.

10:20.249 --> 10:22.708
- Oh, great.

10:22.708 --> 10:24.490
(car doors unlocking)

10:24.490 --> 10:26.465
- (sighs) All right.

10:26.465 --> 10:27.298
- Hold on.

10:28.987 --> 10:30.187
(Radio beeps)
Dispatch.

10:31.470 --> 10:33.690
Dispatch, this is 1389.

10:33.690 --> 10:37.410
Car stopped, Williams
and Third, red light,

10:37.410 --> 10:42.410
Nevada plates 3 1 4, Ida, Nora, David.

10:49.050 --> 10:50.213
- [Dispatcher] Ten four.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.570
- You good?
- Yeah.

10:57.573 --> 11:00.906
(seat belts unbuckling)

11:04.582 --> 11:06.999
(door thuds)

11:13.507 --> 11:16.340
(traffic droning)

11:24.540 --> 11:25.373
- [Harrison] Good evening, sir, you know

11:25.373 --> 11:26.790
why I pulled you over?

11:26.790 --> 11:28.342
- No.

11:28.342 --> 11:29.175
- No?

11:29.175 --> 11:30.180
- No.
- See that red light

11:30.180 --> 11:31.350
over there?

11:31.350 --> 11:32.970
- No.
- On Williams? You ran it.

11:32.970 --> 11:33.803
- Really?

11:33.803 --> 11:34.740
- Yes.

11:34.740 --> 11:36.240
- Wow, I thought it was green.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.920
- Hey man, you put the camera down.

11:43.920 --> 11:44.753
You don't have to be filming us.

11:44.753 --> 11:45.809
- No, no, no, I got it.

11:45.809 --> 11:47.600
If I cough, you might shoot me.

11:47.600 --> 11:48.807
(Jimenes chuckles)

11:48.807 --> 11:49.640
So.
- [Harrison] No,

11:49.640 --> 11:50.761
we're not gonna shoot you, but yeah,

11:50.761 --> 11:53.160
we did catch you on the camera.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.600
- I could have sworn it was green.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.461
- Oh shit, hold on.

11:55.461 --> 11:57.106
You know, the funny thing is
your opinion doesn't matter.

11:57.106 --> 11:58.250
Can I see your driver's license

11:58.250 --> 12:00.510
and registration, please.
- See, my opinion does matter.

12:00.510 --> 12:01.343
Just because of color

12:01.343 --> 12:02.910
doesn't mean it doesn't.
- [Jimenes] Hey, hey!

12:02.910 --> 12:04.833
Hey, buddy, just listen to him, man.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.883
All right, just listen to him, all right?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.279
- License and registration, please.

12:11.279 --> 12:14.862
(Glove compartment clacks)

12:16.428 --> 12:17.929
Thank you, sir.

12:17.929 --> 12:19.330
Happy birthday.

12:19.330 --> 12:21.690
- [Jimenes] Is it your birthday?

12:21.690 --> 12:22.680
When's your birthday?

12:22.680 --> 12:23.940
- Is this driver's license gonna be clean

12:23.940 --> 12:25.080
or is there anything on your record

12:25.080 --> 12:27.893
that you want to tell me about
right now, before I run this?

12:30.600 --> 12:33.960
Yeah, I think I should say
that there's a party coming up

12:33.960 --> 12:34.803
at my house, so.

12:36.630 --> 12:37.473
- Listen, hey,

12:38.580 --> 12:39.413
I think what my partner's
trying to tell you

12:39.413 --> 12:41.670
is that we're gonna give
you a warning right now.

12:41.670 --> 12:42.503
All right?

12:45.270 --> 12:46.359
All right.

12:46.359 --> 12:47.192
Here you go, sir.
- I mean,

12:47.192 --> 12:48.025
I didn't do anything,
- You're good.

12:48.025 --> 12:49.308
- but thank you.
- Have a good night, man.

12:49.308 --> 12:50.617
Have a good one.

12:50.617 --> 12:53.249
- [Harrison] A warning?

12:53.249 --> 12:54.510
He's got a warrant for -

12:54.510 --> 12:56.198
You know somebody you
freaking (indistinct).

12:56.198 --> 12:58.448
- Man, I don't wanna
deal with the paperwork.

12:59.550 --> 13:00.700
You taught me that, so.

13:06.688 --> 13:08.728
- I don't have the fucking ticket machine.

13:08.728 --> 13:10.050
(doors thud)

13:10.050 --> 13:11.070
- I don't wanna deal with it either.

13:11.070 --> 13:12.620
Fucking flashlights dying, man.

13:13.728 --> 13:16.110
- Jesus.
- Forgot to charge it.

13:16.110 --> 13:17.820
- Well, there's no
fucking charger in here,

13:17.820 --> 13:19.140
so you're shit out of luck.

13:19.140 --> 13:19.973
- Shit.

13:21.027 --> 13:23.527
(static ping)

13:28.090 --> 13:29.178
(police radio beeping)

13:29.178 --> 13:31.200
- [Dispatcher] (breaking
up) 1389 we have a body

13:31.200 --> 13:33.423
inside cart.

13:35.130 --> 13:37.230
- Dispatch, what was that?

13:37.230 --> 13:39.360
- [Dispatcher] 1389 we
have a PR who found a body

13:39.360 --> 13:41.210
inside a shelter on Fifth and Carter.

13:43.020 --> 13:43.863
- Ten four.

13:45.180 --> 13:47.008
So much for a quiet night.

13:47.008 --> 13:47.841
- All right.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.937
- I'll let you do the
paperwork on this first one,

13:51.937 --> 13:55.458
just so you get the hang of it, okay?

13:55.458 --> 13:58.708
(police siren wailing)

14:04.597 --> 14:09.048
We're gonna come out here
(indistinct) and were we -

14:09.048 --> 14:10.417
I didn't really catch everything you said,

14:10.417 --> 14:12.067
I wasn't paying attention.

14:12.067 --> 14:14.057
- Fifth and Carter.

14:14.057 --> 14:16.239
We're right here, actually, aren't we?

14:16.239 --> 14:17.778
- Up here?
- Yeah, it's just right here.

14:17.778 --> 14:18.861
Look at this.

14:22.423 --> 14:25.373
- All right, let's take
this nice and easy, okay?

14:26.654 --> 14:28.311
(Jimenes mumbles indistinctly)

14:28.311 --> 14:29.144
Hmm.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.181
(seat belts unbuckling)

14:32.181 --> 14:33.160
Let's see what this is.

14:40.222 --> 14:41.070
How you doing, sir?

14:41.070 --> 14:41.903
You the one that called it in?

14:41.903 --> 14:43.647
- Yeah, I'm the one that found him.

14:44.993 --> 14:46.530
- [Harrison] What have you got for us?

14:46.530 --> 14:49.800
- So I was doing my
rounds like I normally do.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.200
- Okay.
- I heard a scream.

14:52.470 --> 14:54.540
And there's a lot of
drama around here usually,

14:54.540 --> 14:57.425
so, pretty much my intui-
- Just breathe for me, okay,

14:57.425 --> 14:58.258
just breathe.

14:58.258 --> 15:00.690
- Okay.
- Keep going, just relax.

15:00.690 --> 15:04.800
- So I went in the building
and about 10, 15 feet in,

15:04.800 --> 15:06.930
I saw a body laying there.

15:06.930 --> 15:09.720
I yelled, tried to get their attention.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.550
Didn't get any response at all.

15:11.550 --> 15:13.980
- Okay, can you show me where that's at?

15:13.980 --> 15:15.176
- Yeah, it's right around over here.

15:15.176 --> 15:16.009
- You'll walk us over there?

15:16.009 --> 15:16.842
Okay, great.

15:21.690 --> 15:23.880
So have you worked here for a long time?

15:23.880 --> 15:25.380
- Yeah, I've been here for a couple years.

15:25.380 --> 15:26.700
- Yeah?

15:26.700 --> 15:28.980
You seen anything like this before?

15:28.980 --> 15:29.970
- Never, nothing like this.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.950
It's a pretty creepy fucking place, but.

15:31.950 --> 15:33.750
- Yeah, this is,
- Never dealt with this.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.910
- Place is not ideal.

15:35.910 --> 15:37.470
Hopefully they pay you well?

15:37.470 --> 15:39.120
- Yeah, not enough for this shit.

15:42.150 --> 15:42.983
- [Harrison] Is there anything

15:42.983 --> 15:44.610
out here we should be worried about?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.550
- Nothing that I know of.

15:47.550 --> 15:49.560
Just what I found in here.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.393
- Okay.

15:53.910 --> 15:55.245
- It's right around this way.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.412
- Around here?

15:58.914 --> 15:59.910
All right, why don't you do me a favor,

15:59.910 --> 16:01.980
Why don't you wait here for me, okay?

16:01.980 --> 16:02.940
- Yeah, I can do that, man.

16:02.940 --> 16:04.800
I seen some people a few
minutes ago running out

16:04.800 --> 16:06.390
of the other side of the building.

16:06.390 --> 16:07.410
I was gonna go check that out.

16:07.410 --> 16:08.243
You're cool with that?

16:08.243 --> 16:09.630
Or stay here?
- No, stay here for me,

16:09.630 --> 16:10.920
so we know where to find you,

16:10.920 --> 16:11.873
just in case anything happens.

16:11.873 --> 16:13.800
We want to know where you're at, okay?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.914
- That's fine with me, you
guys can deal with this shit.

16:15.914 --> 16:17.414
- [Harrison] Okay.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.433
Ready?

16:24.780 --> 16:25.680
What do you think?

16:27.060 --> 16:27.900
- [Jimenes] So much for quiet night, huh?

16:27.900 --> 16:29.399
- Yeah.

16:29.399 --> 16:30.810
(Jimenes chuckles)

16:30.810 --> 16:31.643
- Hey, your first night

16:31.643 --> 16:33.470
where you get to do actual paperwork.

16:35.649 --> 16:36.816
Exciting, huh?

16:44.379 --> 16:46.020
Okay.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.723
You wanna get the entrance over there?

16:49.716 --> 16:52.883
(footsteps crunching)

16:56.618 --> 17:01.618
- [Jimenes] Watch your step, man.

17:06.207 --> 17:07.040
- Yeah.

17:11.476 --> 17:13.692
- It's fucking dark in
here man, can't see shit.

17:13.692 --> 17:17.224
- [Harrison] I can definitely
say it's dark in here.

17:17.224 --> 17:18.250
- [Jimenes] Oh man.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.362
- [Harrison] What do you think?

17:19.362 --> 17:21.541
Age before beauty?

17:21.541 --> 17:22.672
- [Jimenes] Let's do it.

17:22.672 --> 17:25.083
- Metro PD, anybody in here?

17:25.980 --> 17:27.593
- [Jimenes] Metro PD, we're coming in.

17:30.210 --> 17:31.983
- Metro PD, hello hello?

17:37.320 --> 17:39.513
- [Jimenes] Metro PD, anybody in here?

17:41.040 --> 17:42.183
- Metro PD.

17:54.110 --> 17:56.066
(lock clangs)

17:56.066 --> 17:57.696
- [Jimenes] What do you think's in there?

17:57.696 --> 17:59.370
- I don't know, that's fucking weird.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.663
- [Jimenes] Metro PD!

18:06.042 --> 18:08.518
- What kind of building is this?

18:08.518 --> 18:09.523
- [Jimenes] It's supposed to be

18:09.523 --> 18:10.953
a fucking homeless shelter.

18:12.990 --> 18:14.520
- Whew.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.353
Smells like shit.

18:15.353 --> 18:17.393
Definitely smells like a homeless shelter.

18:19.980 --> 18:21.963
Metro PD, anybody in here?

18:46.590 --> 18:47.973
Metro PD, anybody in here?

18:57.415 --> 19:01.228
- [Jimenes] Dude, it feels
fucking weird in here, man.

19:01.228 --> 19:02.670
There's shit everywhere.

19:02.670 --> 19:04.170
- Hey, man, just keep
your head on a swivel.

19:04.170 --> 19:05.693
Just keep moving forward, all right?

19:16.349 --> 19:19.766
- [Jimenes] This doesn't feel right, man.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.597
- You see all these cameras everywhere?

19:31.978 --> 19:34.410
- [Jimenes] Yeah, that's fucking weird.

19:34.410 --> 19:39.410
- [Harrison] Where do these even go to?

19:41.160 --> 19:43.020
Hey, sir!

19:43.020 --> 19:44.790
Hey, Metro PD!

19:44.790 --> 19:47.333
Hey, you wanna come over here
and talk to us for a second?

19:48.210 --> 19:50.693
Sir, can you come talk to
us for a second, please?

19:51.780 --> 19:54.870
Hey, hey, man, let's call
this in, call this in.

19:54.870 --> 19:58.980
- [Jimenes] Dispatch, we
came across a Caucasian male.

19:58.980 --> 19:59.813
- [Dispatcher] Ten four.

19:59.813 --> 20:02.605
- [Harrison] Metro PD, sir,
can you come and talk to us

20:02.605 --> 20:03.688
for a second?

20:04.727 --> 20:06.835
- [Jimenes] Dude, I can't even see him.

20:06.835 --> 20:08.002
Where'd he go?

20:19.967 --> 20:21.153
Did we lose him?

20:23.340 --> 20:24.363
- Hello, sir?

20:34.950 --> 20:37.655
- [Jimenes] Oh, this
doesn't look creepy at all.

20:37.655 --> 20:40.886
- Oh, that's (laughs nervously)

20:40.886 --> 20:42.488
Oh, that's my shadow.

20:42.488 --> 20:44.688
- [Jimenes] (chuckles
nervously) Okay. Okay.

20:56.689 --> 21:00.090
And this room isn't creepy at all, huh?

21:00.090 --> 21:01.780
Now what is this place? Is it -

21:02.640 --> 21:04.023
No lights whatsoever.

21:07.020 --> 21:10.173
- [Harrison] Well, we got
creepy door number one,

21:11.280 --> 21:13.350
number two, or number three.

21:13.350 --> 21:15.313
Which one do you wanna take?

21:15.313 --> 21:16.980
- [Jimenes] Oh, man.

21:19.082 --> 21:21.450
Dude, I don't even know how to get back

21:21.450 --> 21:23.153
to where we came from, man.

21:41.234 --> 21:42.983
- I don't know where that guy went.

21:46.590 --> 21:47.670
- [Jimenes] Oh shit.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.620
- Hey, hey ma'am.

21:49.620 --> 21:50.820
Hey, we're with Metro PD.

21:50.820 --> 21:52.270
We're here to help you, okay?

21:54.584 --> 21:56.163
Ma'am, are you hurt?

21:57.572 --> 21:58.972
Ma'am?
(woman screams)

21:58.972 --> 21:59.889
Hey, calm -

22:00.782 --> 22:02.313
Ma'am! Hey, calm down.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.083
Hey, wait.

22:06.083 --> 22:07.460
- [Jimenes] What was that, man?

22:09.030 --> 22:09.863
The fuck was that?

22:09.863 --> 22:12.560
- [Harrison] Okay, okay, okay.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.567
Okay, wait, okay, you know what?

22:14.567 --> 22:15.648
Let's -

22:15.648 --> 22:17.640
- [Dispatcher] 1389, what's going on?

22:17.640 --> 22:19.400
- [Jimenes] Dispatch, we lost the man,

22:19.400 --> 22:20.940
we came across a woman.

22:20.940 --> 22:24.120
Caucasian female, looked like she was, -

22:24.120 --> 22:26.370
she had some blood on her face.

22:26.370 --> 22:29.010
- Fuck, what in the hell was that?

22:29.010 --> 22:30.270
Oh, I don't like this, man.

22:30.270 --> 22:31.560
I don't like this at all.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.789
- [Jimenes] Dude, what the fuck was that?

22:33.789 --> 22:36.140
Fuck, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

22:36.140 --> 22:39.473
(indistinct whispering)

22:41.070 --> 22:41.970
Oh fuck.

22:41.970 --> 22:43.628
- [Harrison] What?

22:43.628 --> 22:44.708
- [Jimenes] What the fuck?

22:44.708 --> 22:45.541
- [Harrison] What?

22:45.541 --> 22:47.357
- We've got the body in the next room.

22:48.430 --> 22:49.800
- [Harrison] What? No no no.

22:49.800 --> 22:50.813
Where? Fuck.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.443
Fuck. Okay.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, come on, let's go.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.680
Come on, come on.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.200
- [Jimenes] Sir, sir?

23:04.200 --> 23:05.433
Hey, can you hear me?

23:06.870 --> 23:09.229
Hey, hey, who did this to you?

23:09.229 --> 23:12.477
- Dispatch, come in, over.

24:18.630 --> 24:21.573

24:28.200 --> 24:29.033
where you're going, man.

24:29.033 --> 24:31.473

25:09.876 --> 25:11.459

25:39.743 --> 25:40.630
Who did this to you?

25:42.070 --> 25:44.517
- Dispatch. Anybody copy?

25:44.517 --> 25:46.950
We need EMS, we need backup.

25:46.950 --> 25:50.160
Anybody, come in, over.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.918
Paramedics, we need ambulance.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.118
We need backup now.
- You're gonna die in here.

25:54.118 --> 25:57.235

Fuck.

25:58.168 --> 26:00.068
What the fuck?

26:00.068 --> 26:02.040

26:05.277 --> 26:06.746

26:06.746 --> 26:08.378
- You're gonna die in here.

26:08.378 --> 26:09.900
- [Harrison] What'd he say?

26:09.900 --> 26:12.099

26:13.198 --> 26:15.507
We're gonna have to fucking -

26:15.507 --> 26:17.573
Hey, man, you know a
fucking way outta here?

26:20.673 --> 26:22.110
All right, are you sure?

26:22.110 --> 26:23.333
- [Jimenes] What do you think?

26:24.540 --> 26:25.530
- Well it's better than just sitting here.

26:25.530 --> 26:26.820
Hold on, come on, man.

26:26.820 --> 26:27.869
You're good, right?

26:27.869 --> 26:30.759
You okay?

Come on, you're all right.

26:32.878 --> 26:34.278
You good?

26:34.278 --> 26:35.588
- Hey, you got him?

26:35.588 --> 26:36.421
All right.

26:43.937 --> 26:46.947
Okay, so this way?

26:46.947 --> 26:48.389
- It's right around the corner.

26:48.389 --> 26:50.056
- [Harrison] Corner?

26:53.392 --> 26:54.572
- [Jimenes] Okay.

26:54.572 --> 26:59.572
- Are we going the right way?
(person screams)

27:05.136 --> 27:06.439
- [Jimenes] Fuck, is that a -

27:06.439 --> 27:09.689
(door bangs loudly)
Oh!

27:10.981 --> 27:12.481
The fuck was that?

27:17.345 --> 27:18.178
(distant banging)

27:18.178 --> 27:19.230
- [Harrison] All right,
let's just keep moving.

27:19.230 --> 27:20.130
Keep your head up.

27:22.738 --> 27:23.571
Come on, you guys good?

27:23.571 --> 27:24.404
- Yeah.

27:24.404 --> 27:25.373
- [Harrison] Keep moving, okay?

27:27.552 --> 27:29.039
Let's bring him back here.

27:29.039 --> 27:31.622
- [Jimenes] You okay, you okay?

27:38.700 --> 27:40.000
- Let's sit him over here.

27:44.580 --> 27:47.220
Sit him down here, let me just
check this out real quick.

27:47.220 --> 27:48.630
- [Jimenes] You'll be all
right here, I'm gonna go look

27:48.630 --> 27:49.920
for something.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.068
He said the exit was near here.

27:51.068 --> 27:52.801
- [Harrison] Okay.

27:52.801 --> 27:53.801
Look around.

27:55.560 --> 27:56.940
- [Jimenes] What the
fuck was this building

27:56.940 --> 27:58.640
before it turned into a shit hole?

28:03.089 --> 28:05.922
(victim coughing)

28:10.421 --> 28:11.812
What the fuck is this place, man?

28:11.812 --> 28:12.729
(victim continues coughing)

28:12.729 --> 28:14.520
- [Harrison] Dude, that smell
is not getting any better.

28:14.520 --> 28:15.930
It's getting fucking stronger.

28:15.930 --> 28:17.780
Shit hole.
- [Jimenes] You okay?

28:17.780 --> 28:19.298
Oh, fuck.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

28:21.580 --> 28:23.247
Okay, what the fuck?
- What's going on, hey man!

28:25.290 --> 28:26.340
- [Jimenes] He's having
an seizure or something.

28:26.340 --> 28:27.480
- [Harrison] Wait.
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.350
- [Harrison] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:28.350 --> 28:29.183
Sir, you need to calm down.

28:29.183 --> 28:30.540
Take it easy, take it easy!

28:30.540 --> 28:31.560
Sir, you good?

28:31.560 --> 28:32.410
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

28:34.650 --> 28:35.910
Fuck.

28:35.910 --> 28:37.380
Oh, shit.

28:37.380 --> 28:38.213
Sir?

28:39.750 --> 28:41.303
- [Harrison] Check his
pulse, check his pulse.

28:42.900 --> 28:43.853
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.247
- What?
- He's fucking dead.

28:46.247 --> 28:47.107
- What do you mean he's fucking dead?

28:47.107 --> 28:49.798
- He's fucking dead.
- What the fuck?

28:49.798 --> 28:51.249
God, damn it.

28:51.249 --> 28:54.219
Okay, Harrison, think,
fucking Harrison, think, okay.

28:54.219 --> 28:55.136
Okay, fuck.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.117
We gotta keep fucking moving,
we gotta keep fucking moving.

28:59.117 --> 28:59.950
Okay think.
- Oh, shit.

29:00.965 --> 29:03.828
- [Harrison] What do we need to do?

29:03.828 --> 29:07.250
We need to get the fuck outta
here, is what we need to do.

29:07.250 --> 29:08.083
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

29:08.083 --> 29:10.410
- [Harrison] Dispatch,
anybody come in, over.

29:10.410 --> 29:11.243
Please.

29:12.179 --> 29:17.179
- [Jimenes] Oh, fuck.

29:18.729 --> 29:21.270
Dude, there's blood on my fucking vest.

29:21.270 --> 29:24.540
- [Harrison] There has to
be another fucking way out.

29:24.540 --> 29:26.580
You know, maybe if we follow
some of these camera cables,

29:26.580 --> 29:27.680
we can find a way out.

29:28.658 --> 29:31.223
Maybe it still leads to a
security room or something.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.673
You good?

29:37.193 --> 29:38.912
Pete.

29:38.912 --> 29:40.695
Pete!

29:40.695 --> 29:42.746
- [Jimenes] What? What?

29:42.746 --> 29:44.352
- Pete.
- [Jimenes] What?

29:44.352 --> 29:46.185
(eater growling)

29:46.185 --> 29:48.463
- [Jimenes] What the fuck?
- [Harrison] Hey, get off!

29:48.463 --> 29:49.296
Get off!
(Jimenes screaming)

29:49.296 --> 29:52.412
(high-pitched beeping)
(heart beating rapidly)

29:52.412 --> 29:55.317
(eater growling)
(Jimenes screaming)

29:55.317 --> 29:57.980
(flashlight thudding)

29:57.980 --> 30:01.563
(Jimenes breathing loudly)

30:02.576 --> 30:03.865
Where'd you learn how
to take a fucking pulse?

30:03.865 --> 30:05.220
- [Jimenes] No, shit.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.180
- Hey, look at me, look at me.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.740
Relax, relax.

30:07.740 --> 30:08.573
Pete!

30:09.960 --> 30:10.833
Just relax, okay?

30:11.745 --> 30:13.351
- Yeah.
- [Harrison] Okay.

30:13.351 --> 30:14.184
We gotta think smart.

30:14.184 --> 30:15.690
We gotta get outta here.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.140
- We need to just fucking go.

30:18.690 --> 30:20.700
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait my, my,

30:20.700 --> 30:22.320
I dropped my pistol, man.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.460
I dropped my fucking pistol.

30:23.460 --> 30:24.293
- [Harrison] What the fuck?

30:24.293 --> 30:25.203
- I must have dropped it when I was

30:25.203 --> 30:26.036
in the other room walking
- Pete! Hey, come here,

30:26.036 --> 30:26.869
- through here.
- here, stop stop stop.

30:26.869 --> 30:28.149
- We have to go back,
- Relax, relax.

30:28.149 --> 30:31.976
- [Harrison] All right, okay, you got -

30:31.976 --> 30:32.809
What do you, what do you have?

30:32.809 --> 30:33.642
You got a baton?

30:33.642 --> 30:34.980
- I have a baton, yeah.
- You have your taser?

30:34.980 --> 30:35.820
- Yeah.
- We're good, we're good,

30:35.820 --> 30:38.340
we're good, we can't fucking
go back for that shit.

30:38.340 --> 30:39.515
Somebody probably already picked it up.

30:39.515 --> 30:40.650
You don't want to get
shot with your own gun.

30:40.650 --> 30:41.954
That'd be embarrassing, right?

30:41.954 --> 30:42.787
- Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:42.787 --> 30:44.400
- [Harrison] Just keep breathing.

30:44.400 --> 30:45.390
- We gotta go back for my -
- Let's just keep,

30:45.390 --> 30:46.710
Let's just keep moving.

30:46.710 --> 30:48.270
- Oh, fuck.
- Let's just keep moving.

30:48.270 --> 30:49.103
Okay?

30:49.103 --> 30:50.553
- Yeah.
- I got my gun.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.000
I'll take the lead, let's
just keep moving, okay?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.890
Just relax, okay?

30:55.890 --> 30:56.840
Let's just go home.

30:57.930 --> 30:58.763
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

30:59.684 --> 31:00.517
What the fuck was that?

31:08.952 --> 31:11.952
(electronic static)

31:42.004 --> 31:44.504
(static ping)

31:48.497 --> 31:49.330
- Oh, man.

31:51.273 --> 31:52.165
You almost have to laugh about it

31:52.165 --> 31:53.765
'cause it's so fucked up, right?

31:55.410 --> 31:56.243
Right, Pete?

31:57.381 --> 31:58.308
- Yeah.

31:58.308 --> 31:59.556
- It's pretty, man, you're good.

31:59.556 --> 32:00.780
We're good, we're good.

32:00.780 --> 32:03.180
We're gonna get outta
here, we're gonna go home.

32:08.130 --> 32:11.640
All right, Pete, would you rather have sex

32:11.640 --> 32:15.990
with that diseased tranny
that we picked up last week?

32:15.990 --> 32:17.790
That nasty prostitute, you remember?

32:19.410 --> 32:21.780
Or have sex with that dead guy?

32:21.780 --> 32:23.130
And you have to choose one.

32:24.480 --> 32:27.500
You can't kill yourself
either, you gotta choose one.

32:27.500 --> 32:30.091
- Oh man, I don't know.

32:30.091 --> 32:30.924
- I don't know, man.

32:30.924 --> 32:33.270
- [Harrison] Come on,
man, just, let's play.

32:33.270 --> 32:34.149
We play this all the time.

32:34.149 --> 32:36.613
- Dude, what the fuck
was wrong with that guy?

32:36.613 --> 32:37.560
- I don't know.
- Was a fucking animal, man.

32:37.560 --> 32:38.960
He was trying to bite me.

32:40.290 --> 32:42.630
I honestly, I've never
seen that shit before

32:42.630 --> 32:43.590
in my entire life.

32:43.590 --> 32:44.533
It doesn't make sense.

32:44.533 --> 32:46.338
- Wait, Wait, Wait, Wait.

32:46.338 --> 32:47.650
(low groaning)

32:47.650 --> 32:48.750
What the fuck is that?

33:00.870 --> 33:02.447
Wishful thinking, right?

33:11.676 --> 33:14.509
- [Jimenes] What the fuck is that?

33:16.951 --> 33:21.951
- All right. (indistinct)

33:22.333 --> 33:24.021
All right, cover me, okay?

33:24.021 --> 33:24.854
I'm gonna go in.

33:24.854 --> 33:26.640
- No, man, just stay back here, man.

33:26.640 --> 33:27.480
- [Harrison] Just cover me, okay?

33:27.480 --> 33:29.250
Just, just -
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

33:29.250 --> 33:30.620
- Just calm down for a second.

33:32.553 --> 33:34.353
Just stare at your friend over here.

33:54.050 --> 33:56.883
Fucking camera.
- Man, just stay back.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.153
- [Harrison] Relax, relax.

34:05.940 --> 34:07.110
Chillax, okay?

34:07.110 --> 34:08.640
We're good, we're good.

34:08.640 --> 34:09.473
Okay?

34:26.820 --> 34:27.770
- [Jimenes] Jensen?

34:33.021 --> 34:35.688
(distant noise)

34:39.881 --> 34:42.325
- [Harrison] Oh fuck.

34:42.325 --> 34:43.294
Oh, just breathe.

34:43.294 --> 34:44.127
Just, breathe Harrison.

34:44.127 --> 34:44.960
- [Jimenes] Jensen.

34:46.710 --> 34:47.543
Jensen!

34:55.790 --> 34:57.660
- [Harrison] What?

34:57.660 --> 34:59.645
- [Jimenes] Jensen!
- [Harrison] What?

34:59.645 --> 35:02.325
What?
- What are you doing in there?

35:02.325 --> 35:04.723
- [Harrison] Nothing, nothing.

35:04.723 --> 35:06.439
(heavy breathing)

35:06.439 --> 35:08.389
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.
- [Harrison] Ma'am, Ma'am.

35:08.389 --> 35:09.305
(woman groans)

35:09.305 --> 35:11.659
- Hey, calm down, ma'am!
(woman continues groaning)

35:11.659 --> 35:13.117
- [Jimenes] What the fuck?

35:13.117 --> 35:14.411
- [Harrison] Okay, what's happening?

35:14.411 --> 35:16.572
- [Jimenes] This is fucking
number two, fucking number two!

35:16.572 --> 35:18.273
What the fuck, what the f-

35:18.273 --> 35:19.157
- [Harrison] Ma'am!

35:19.157 --> 35:20.574
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

35:21.469 --> 35:22.786
(low groaning)
Oh, shit.

35:22.786 --> 35:24.390
What the fuck is that?

35:24.390 --> 35:27.750
- Sir, sir, put your hands up.

35:27.750 --> 35:28.597
Let me see 'em.

35:31.036 --> 35:31.869
Sir?

35:32.790 --> 35:34.445
- [Jimenes] Wait, Jensen.

35:34.445 --> 35:37.058
Jensen.

35:37.058 --> 35:37.902
- [Harrison] Did you see his -

35:37.902 --> 35:40.710
- Jensen, Jensen, man, there's
something up with that man.

35:40.710 --> 35:42.300
- [Harrison] Dude, he's
just fucking scared.

35:42.300 --> 35:44.341
Dude was just fucking -
- No, come on.

35:44.341 --> 35:46.204
- He's just fucking scared.
- Something's up with him.

35:46.204 --> 35:47.730
- It's good, come on, just relax.

35:47.730 --> 35:48.611
- Watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out!

35:48.611 --> 35:49.444
(eater growling)

35:49.444 --> 35:52.361
(gunshots banging)

35:54.082 --> 35:54.999
Dude, fuck.

35:56.057 --> 35:57.373
- Oh, fuck.

35:57.373 --> 35:58.206
Fuck.

35:59.858 --> 36:00.956
Did you see that (indistinct)?

36:00.956 --> 36:03.540
Dude, he just came fucking at me!

36:03.540 --> 36:04.620
Dude, he came at me, right?

36:04.620 --> 36:05.484
- [Jimenes] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:05.484 --> 36:06.317
He did, he did, he did.

36:06.317 --> 36:07.676
- Okay.

36:07.676 --> 36:09.030
(Harrison breathing heavily)

36:09.030 --> 36:09.863
Oh, fuck.

36:10.980 --> 36:12.900
That was not my fault.

36:12.900 --> 36:13.733
Oh, fuck.

36:15.188 --> 36:17.004
I had to shoot, I had no other choice.

36:17.004 --> 36:20.259
- You're good, you're good.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck!

36:20.259 --> 36:21.300
Okay, what do we do?

36:21.300 --> 36:22.965
- She's gone.
- Fuck, what?

36:22.965 --> 36:23.947
- [Jimenes] She's gone!

36:23.947 --> 36:27.118
- [Harrison] Where the fuck is the girl?

36:27.118 --> 36:28.476
What the fuck is going on?

36:28.476 --> 36:29.500
What the fuck?

36:29.500 --> 36:32.010
All right, all right,
Harrison, just relax.

36:32.010 --> 36:34.140
Just think, think, think, think.

36:34.140 --> 36:36.040
We gotta get a fucking way outta here.

36:39.245 --> 36:40.078
(floorboards creaking)

36:40.078 --> 36:41.557
- What the fuck?
- What is that, man?

36:41.557 --> 36:44.357
Should we just go back the way we came?

36:46.517 --> 36:48.383
- [Jimenes] How the fuck do
you know where to go back, man?

36:52.799 --> 36:56.940
(indistinct whispering)

36:56.940 --> 36:58.643
- [Harrison] Dispatch, do you copy?

37:01.080 --> 37:02.730
Dispatch!

37:02.730 --> 37:04.307
You think he's actually dead?

37:04.307 --> 37:05.804
- [Jimenes] Oh man,

37:05.804 --> 37:07.553
I don't know what the
fuck is going on, man.

37:08.414 --> 37:10.403
- Must have put three rounds in that guy.

37:13.508 --> 37:14.580
(distant rattling)

37:14.580 --> 37:17.080
(static ping)

37:17.948 --> 37:20.110
Hey, Jimenes, you smell that?

37:20.110 --> 37:21.585
- Yeah.

37:21.585 --> 37:23.628
Yeah, what is that?

37:23.628 --> 37:25.045
Smells like shit.

37:39.997 --> 37:41.160
- [Harrison] Jimenes, hey.
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

37:41.160 --> 37:42.870
- [Harrison] Hey, we got a body.

37:42.870 --> 37:44.340
Ma'am?
- Ma'am?

37:44.340 --> 37:46.983
Oh shit she looks fucking
sick or something.

37:50.250 --> 37:52.044
What's wrong with her?

37:52.044 --> 37:53.694
- [Harrison] She's not breathing.

37:56.277 --> 37:59.596
I don't think there's anything
else we can do for her now.

37:59.596 --> 38:01.013
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

38:10.501 --> 38:11.334
Jesus.

38:13.534 --> 38:14.883
- [Harrison] Jimenes!

38:14.883 --> 38:15.966
Hey, come on.

38:17.667 --> 38:19.440
Hey, we gotta stick together, man.

38:19.440 --> 38:21.180
I don't go home, you
don't go home, all right?

38:21.180 --> 38:22.013
Let's go.

38:26.410 --> 38:28.410
Get the fuck outta here.

38:29.443 --> 38:30.276
(zipper whirring)

38:30.276 --> 38:32.609
- [Jimenes] Wait, wait wait.

38:33.510 --> 38:34.613
- [Harrison] You hear something?

38:35.778 --> 38:37.260
- [Jimenes] I thought I heard something.

38:37.260 --> 38:38.573
- Come on, let's keep going.

38:44.376 --> 38:46.499
- [Jimenes] Ah, fuck.

38:46.499 --> 38:47.332
Oh, fuck.

38:51.307 --> 38:53.163
- Dispatch, dispatch, come in, over.

38:56.820 --> 38:57.820
Dispatch, you there?

39:00.490 --> 39:01.743
- Fuck.
- Dispatch?

39:02.635 --> 39:03.933
Hey, dispatch, hey.

39:05.505 --> 39:07.200
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

39:07.200 --> 39:10.000
- Dispatch, it's critical
now, we need backup now, over.

39:14.708 --> 39:16.125
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.310
- Dispatch, we're trapped
inside this building.

39:20.310 --> 39:21.843
Where is our freaking backup?

39:23.520 --> 39:25.950
- [Sergeant] Harrison,
Jimenes, are you guys there?

39:25.950 --> 39:26.783
- Sarge? Hey!

39:26.783 --> 39:27.616
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:27.616 --> 39:28.449
Hey, Sarge,

39:29.340 --> 39:32.010
Sarge, we are at the old homeless shelter

39:32.010 --> 39:34.350
on Fifth and Carter.

39:34.350 --> 39:35.790
We need backup right away.

39:35.790 --> 39:36.990
Where are you guys at?

39:36.990 --> 39:38.220
- [Jimenes] I think we're
in the northeast side

39:38.220 --> 39:39.053
of the building.

39:39.053 --> 39:41.844
- We're in the northeast
side of the building.

39:41.844 --> 39:43.560
- [Sergeant] Backup is five minutes out.

39:43.560 --> 39:44.850
- Backup is five minutes out?

39:44.850 --> 39:46.500
Hey, Sarge, we ain't got five minutes.

39:46.500 --> 39:47.883
We need backup now.

39:48.990 --> 39:50.070
There's some weird shit going on here.

39:50.070 --> 39:51.270
We need you now.

39:51.270 --> 39:52.290
- [Sergeant] We're on our way.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.163
Just hold on.

39:55.890 --> 39:57.750
- [Harrison] Hold on to what?

39:57.750 --> 39:59.370
- So we're supposed to sit here and wait?

39:59.370 --> 40:00.630
Oh, no, no, no, no, I don't know.

40:00.630 --> 40:01.463
No.

40:04.410 --> 40:05.243
Think.

40:06.603 --> 40:08.880
- Man, this makes no fucking sense.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.560
How do we not have signal in here?

40:10.560 --> 40:11.520
We're in the middle of the city

40:11.520 --> 40:13.020
and we have no fucking signal.

40:14.460 --> 40:15.750
- [Harrison] Yeah, something's cutting off

40:15.750 --> 40:17.100
our fucking signal in here.

40:20.727 --> 40:21.950
- [Jimenes] Wait, wait wait.

40:21.950 --> 40:22.860
Don't think it's kind of weird

40:22.860 --> 40:25.863
that there's no fucking
windows in here, man?

40:27.990 --> 40:29.100
There's no windows on the outside,

40:29.100 --> 40:31.200
there's nothing that can connect anyone

40:31.200 --> 40:32.641
from in here out there,

40:32.641 --> 40:35.494
It's almost like - (sighs)

40:35.494 --> 40:36.840
it's almost like they're trying
to keep something in here,

40:36.840 --> 40:39.063
something to control whatever's in here.

40:40.169 --> 40:41.763
It's fucking weird, man.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.270
We can't just sit here, man.

40:48.270 --> 40:49.980
We can't just be sitting here.

40:49.980 --> 40:50.923
There has to -

40:50.923 --> 40:52.710
We have to do something.

40:52.710 --> 40:54.120
God knows how far out they are.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.283
Five minutes is long time.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.370
- You know, let's just keep moving.

40:59.370 --> 41:01.757
Sarge will get back to us sooner or later.

41:34.202 --> 41:37.320
Your guess is as good as mine, man.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.080
I mean, this whole place looks like it's -

41:40.080 --> 41:41.340
We're in a fucking maze,

41:41.340 --> 41:44.056
we're going in the same
circle over and over.

41:44.056 --> 41:47.056
(electronic static)

42:41.347 --> 42:44.014
- [Jimenes] Man, this is fucked.

42:48.667 --> 42:50.280
- [Harrison] This is a fucked up place.

42:50.280 --> 42:52.200
This is a shelter home?

42:52.200 --> 42:53.650
- This is not a shelter, man.

42:55.620 --> 42:56.460
There's supposed to be beds.

42:56.460 --> 42:59.717
There's supposed to be
things to help the people.

43:26.757 --> 43:30.330
- All right, Pete, would
you rather have sex

43:30.330 --> 43:34.890
with a zombie or would you rather have sex

43:34.890 --> 43:38.700
with a 102-year-old woman
who's on her deathbed?

43:38.700 --> 43:40.048
- We're doing this again?

43:40.048 --> 43:42.663
- (chuckles) Until you pick one.

43:44.345 --> 43:45.743
And you can't kill yourself.

43:49.050 --> 43:50.657
Pick one.

43:50.657 --> 43:52.080
- [Jimenes] The the woman man, the woman.

43:52.080 --> 43:53.043
The old lady, fuck.

43:54.120 --> 43:56.580
- Disgusting.
- You fucking asked.

43:56.580 --> 43:57.413
- Gross.

43:58.438 --> 44:00.210
You have a thing for old ladies.

44:00.210 --> 44:02.717
You usually do that for money, right?

44:07.260 --> 44:08.550
I think I might take the zombie,

44:08.550 --> 44:10.890
because you know it's already dead,

44:10.890 --> 44:12.040
she's not gonna say no.

44:15.978 --> 44:18.313
(distant growling)

44:18.313 --> 44:20.936
- [Jimenes] Dude, is there three of them?

44:20.936 --> 44:23.769
(distant banging)

44:48.322 --> 44:51.655
- Wait, wait, wait.
- You hear something?

44:52.936 --> 44:54.086
- [Jimenes] Dude, what is that?

44:54.086 --> 44:55.083
- Is that coming from in here?

44:55.083 --> 44:56.333
Or is that ups-

44:58.184 --> 44:59.017
Hello?

45:09.896 --> 45:10.729
Hello?

45:22.045 --> 45:23.582
Jimenes! Jimenes!

45:23.582 --> 45:25.137
- [Jimenes] What?

45:25.137 --> 45:26.115
- Hey.

45:26.115 --> 45:27.293
Hey, how are you guys doing?

45:30.720 --> 45:32.457
We're Metro PD, we're
here to help you, okay?

45:32.457 --> 45:33.633
Are you guys hurt?

45:37.380 --> 45:38.213
Any pain?

45:40.680 --> 45:42.810
Can you guys walk?
- [Jimenes] Hey.

45:42.810 --> 45:43.643
Hey!

45:43.643 --> 45:45.973
- [Harrison] Hold on, give
me just one second, okay?

45:45.973 --> 45:48.210
- What, dude, this is my spot.

45:48.210 --> 45:50.188
- [Jimenes] Whoa, whoa.

45:50.188 --> 45:52.890
- What the fuck is going on?

45:52.890 --> 45:54.570
- [Harrison] Relax, it's the police, okay.

45:54.570 --> 45:55.683
- Oh God.

45:58.200 --> 45:59.033
- [Jimenes] You okay? It-

45:59.033 --> 46:01.617
Whoa, shit, what happened
to your arm, man?

46:01.617 --> 46:05.130
- Well, I was coming home last night,

46:05.130 --> 46:06.960
if you could call this home.
- [Jimenes] God.

46:06.960 --> 46:10.680
- And a dude jumped out from behind a wall

46:10.680 --> 46:13.000
and started like rambling something at me

46:14.217 --> 46:15.717
and, I don't know.

46:17.376 --> 46:19.976
He just fucking bit me.

46:19.976 --> 46:20.809
- [Jimenes] Well, we'll get someone

46:20.809 --> 46:21.642
to take a look at that for you.

46:21.642 --> 46:23.340
Do you guys know of an exit?

46:23.340 --> 46:25.110
Another exit from here?

46:25.110 --> 46:27.750
- Well, there should be
one up front, nearby.

46:27.750 --> 46:30.720
- [Harrison] No, we tried
that one, it was locked.

46:30.720 --> 46:32.320
Do you guys know of another one?

46:33.510 --> 46:35.973
- There's one in the
back on the lower level.

46:36.870 --> 46:39.150
- Okay.
- What do we have to lose?

46:39.150 --> 46:40.320
Let's go.
- Let's do it.

46:40.320 --> 46:41.400
- All right guys.
- Cool.

46:41.400 --> 46:43.146
- You guys ready, you guys good?

46:43.146 --> 46:43.979
You wanna get outta here?

46:43.979 --> 46:45.916
We have EMS and paramedics
waiting for us on the outside

46:45.916 --> 46:48.552
to look at you guys, so.

46:48.552 --> 46:49.385
Okay?

46:50.926 --> 46:51.759
- [Jimenes] Come with us, buddy.

46:51.759 --> 46:52.592
We'll get some help for you, okay?

46:52.592 --> 46:53.790
- I'm not going to jail, am I?

46:53.790 --> 46:54.623
- [Jimenes] No, no, no, no, no.

46:54.623 --> 46:55.680
We're just gonna get you guys outta here.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.508
Doesn't look safe in here.

46:57.508 --> 46:59.340
(person moaning)
You good? You okay?

46:59.340 --> 47:00.173
- Yes.

47:01.920 --> 47:04.980
Gonna have some breakfast, might as well.

47:04.980 --> 47:06.773
Pulled it out of the dumpster myself.

47:08.280 --> 47:10.580
- [Harrison] Stay close,
you guys, stay close.

47:14.823 --> 47:16.473
- [Harrison] Stay nice and close.

47:32.624 --> 47:34.140
Jimenes, bringing up the rear?

47:34.140 --> 47:35.130
- Yeah.
- You good?

47:35.130 --> 47:35.980
- [Jimenes] Yeah.

47:45.237 --> 47:46.193
- [Harrison] Hey, check
it out, check it out.

47:47.340 --> 47:50.700
Some cameras probably has
to be a control around here,

47:50.700 --> 47:52.500
we could contact someone from here.

47:52.500 --> 47:53.853
- No, not a chance.

47:54.990 --> 47:57.060
They're monitored off-site.

47:57.060 --> 47:58.050
- [Harrison] You sure?

47:58.050 --> 48:00.750
- Mm hmm, positive.

48:00.750 --> 48:01.800
I volunteer here.

48:01.800 --> 48:03.450
It's my job to know those things.

48:04.740 --> 48:05.640
- [Harrison] Shit.

48:49.920 --> 48:51.180
Jimenes, we got a tent in here, man.

48:51.180 --> 48:53.183
I think this is where
the smell is coming from.

48:56.483 --> 48:57.769
(tent panels rustling)

48:57.769 --> 49:00.436
(flies buzzing)

49:02.925 --> 49:05.730
- We're good, keep on moving, guys.

49:05.730 --> 49:06.783
Just watch your step.

49:07.884 --> 49:08.717
Okay.

49:39.420 --> 49:40.920
- [Jimenes] So what kind of
homeless shelter is this?

49:40.920 --> 49:42.150
I mean, this place is empty.

49:42.150 --> 49:44.460
Do you usually have more people?

49:44.460 --> 49:48.093
- Yeah, people come in
and out all the time.

49:49.080 --> 49:51.855
- There's never an exact
amount of people here.

49:51.855 --> 49:53.130
- [Harrison] What?

49:53.130 --> 49:55.213
What do you mean, what kind
of homeless shelter is this?

49:55.213 --> 49:58.275
(person coughs)

49:58.275 --> 49:59.490
Oh, fuck, are you okay?

49:59.490 --> 50:00.363
Oh shit!

50:03.484 --> 50:05.340
(person groans)

50:05.340 --> 50:06.572
You okay?

50:06.572 --> 50:08.133
- (groans) Yep.

50:09.270 --> 50:10.103
I need a second.

50:10.103 --> 50:11.391
- [Harrison] Come on, man, we
don't have time for this shit.

50:11.391 --> 50:12.626
We gotta keep moving, okay?

50:12.626 --> 50:15.293
(woman screams)

50:17.143 --> 50:19.740
- [Jimenes] We've got movement back here.

50:19.740 --> 50:21.693
- [Harrison] What the fuck?

50:21.693 --> 50:23.820
- Have you guys seen anything crazy

50:23.820 --> 50:26.430
or anything outta the ordinary lately?

50:26.430 --> 50:31.204
- Just a few sick people and
just some fights and that's it.

50:31.204 --> 50:33.180
- Why are you guys here?
- [Jimenes] Fights?

50:33.180 --> 50:35.760
- [Harrison] We got called for an assault.

50:35.760 --> 50:36.810
You know, the security guard said

50:36.810 --> 50:39.393
there might be an injury
here, or a possible body.

50:40.290 --> 50:43.020
We found one guy and then he attacked us.

50:43.020 --> 50:44.220
We kept moving and found another guy.

50:44.220 --> 50:46.800
He attacked us and he had
this fucking crazy rage

50:46.800 --> 50:48.113
in his eyes.
- Wait.

50:49.342 --> 50:50.822
We noticed there were some people

50:50.822 --> 50:53.730
who get sick and they
just go to the hospital.

50:53.730 --> 50:56.340
- Yeah, we realize
everyone that left sick,

50:56.340 --> 50:57.423
they never came back.

51:01.230 --> 51:03.180
- [Harrison] Thank you guys.

51:03.180 --> 51:06.841
- We thought it was another
strain of COVID or something.

51:06.841 --> 51:07.674
- COVID?

51:07.674 --> 51:09.630
Oh, no, no, no.

51:09.630 --> 51:11.943
This is something different.

51:13.483 --> 51:14.453
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

51:15.720 --> 51:17.252
Where'd he go?

51:17.252 --> 51:19.620
- Fuck.
- [Harrison] Hey!

51:19.620 --> 51:21.720
- Jimenes, hey, we gotta keep going.

51:21.720 --> 51:23.240
We gotta get these people to safety.

51:23.240 --> 51:24.540
- [Jimenes] Dude, what
about the sick man, though?

51:24.540 --> 51:26.130
- We get outside, we'll have more people

51:26.130 --> 51:27.300
to search this building, okay?

51:27.300 --> 51:28.740
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

51:28.740 --> 51:30.572
- Come on, hey, stay with me.

51:30.572 --> 51:31.431
Jimenes.

51:31.431 --> 51:33.210
- Okay.
- Pete!

51:33.210 --> 51:34.440
- [Jimenes] Gotcha man, yeah.
- Just keep moving, okay?

51:34.440 --> 51:36.583
We gotta get these people outta here.

51:36.583 --> 51:38.641
Okay, which way is this exit?

51:38.641 --> 51:40.558
- [Speaker 2] That way.

51:51.165 --> 51:52.500
Jimenes, you still with me?

51:52.500 --> 51:55.299
- [Jimenes] Yeah, yeah, you're good.

51:55.299 --> 51:57.799
(static ping)

52:05.639 --> 52:08.913
(footsteps thudding)

52:08.913 --> 52:11.496
(man groaning)

52:33.599 --> 52:34.727
- [Jimenes] What the fuck is that?

52:34.727 --> 52:35.639
- We got a body.

52:35.639 --> 52:37.056
[Jimenes] A what?

52:42.937 --> 52:45.017
- [Harrison] Hey! My god, what the fuck?

52:45.017 --> 52:46.137
Hey!

52:46.137 --> 52:50.308
(eaters screeching, growling)

52:50.308 --> 52:51.248
- [Jimenes] Go, go, go, go.

52:51.248 --> 52:53.150
Go, go, go!
(woman screaming)

52:53.150 --> 52:56.067
(gunshots banging)

52:58.068 --> 52:59.743
(woman screaming hysterically)

52:59.743 --> 53:00.576
- Help me!

53:02.353 --> 53:03.936
- [Jimenes] Jensen!

53:05.535 --> 53:08.368
(eaters groaning)

53:11.430 --> 53:12.263
Oh, shit.

53:20.633 --> 53:21.800
What the fuck?

53:24.189 --> 53:25.022
Oh shit.

53:30.127 --> 53:33.592
(gunshots banging)

53:33.592 --> 53:34.467
Jensen!

53:34.467 --> 53:36.668
Down, down, down, down, get down!

53:36.668 --> 53:38.625
(screaming)
(eaters groaning)

53:38.625 --> 53:39.583
Oh, shit!

53:39.583 --> 53:40.541
He's got his gun!

53:40.541 --> 53:42.458
Move, move, move, move!

53:46.409 --> 53:47.587
Oh, shit.

53:47.587 --> 53:50.099
- [Speaker] In here, in here!

53:50.099 --> 53:50.932
Get the door, get the door!

53:50.932 --> 53:53.168
- [Jimenes] Get the door.

53:53.168 --> 53:54.953
(person coughing)

53:54.953 --> 53:55.786
- [Harrison] You okay?

53:55.786 --> 53:57.810
- What the fuck was that?

53:57.810 --> 54:00.310
They're eating that man alive!

54:04.140 --> 54:05.130
We're safe here.

54:05.130 --> 54:07.110
They can't come in here.

54:07.110 --> 54:09.933
Wait, if we stay here,
will they come and find us?

54:13.570 --> 54:14.638
- [Harrison] I don't know.

54:14.638 --> 54:16.200
I don't know.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.430
- What do you mean you don't know?

54:17.430 --> 54:19.020
- It means we don't know, okay?

54:19.020 --> 54:21.993
The Sergeant told us to wait
here and hold for an update.

54:29.580 --> 54:32.730
- Look, hey, look, we
can't stay here, okay?

54:32.730 --> 54:34.650
We gotta fucking move, okay?

54:34.650 --> 54:35.740
You guys with me?

54:37.739 --> 54:38.906
- Up and move.

54:42.628 --> 54:44.776
- [Speaker 2] We're gonna be okay.

54:44.776 --> 54:46.776
It's gonna be all right.

54:48.905 --> 54:50.822
- [Speaker] Okay, yeah.

54:54.664 --> 54:57.414
- [Speaker 2] It's gonna be fine.

55:03.909 --> 55:06.071
- [Harrison] Hey, guys, you're good right?

55:06.071 --> 55:07.228
Still with me?

55:07.228 --> 55:08.061
- Yeah.

55:09.630 --> 55:10.860
- [Harrison] What you got there?

55:10.860 --> 55:11.693
- Okay.

55:12.610 --> 55:15.027
- You good?
- [Jimenes] Yeah.

55:19.677 --> 55:23.279
(furniture shuffling)
(eater growling)

55:23.279 --> 55:25.610
(woman screaming hysterically)
(eater growling)

55:25.610 --> 55:28.148
(high-pitched beep)
(muffled eater growls)

55:28.148 --> 55:30.862
(Jimenes grunting)

55:30.862 --> 55:32.969
- [Harrison] Fuck! Fuck!

55:32.969 --> 55:35.114
(Jimenes grunting)
(eater growling)

55:35.114 --> 55:37.395
(static)

55:37.395 --> 55:38.228
Fuck!

55:38.228 --> 55:39.905
(Jimenes breathing heavily)

55:39.905 --> 55:41.958
Jimenes, you good?

55:41.958 --> 55:45.319
(Jimenes breathes loudly, grunts)

55:45.319 --> 55:46.270
- [Jimenes] Fuck.
- [Harrison] You good?

55:46.270 --> 55:47.103
- [Jimenes] Yeah, all good.

55:47.103 --> 55:47.936
- [Speaker 2] Fuck!

55:49.185 --> 55:50.567

55:51.550 --> 55:56.231

55:56.231 --> 56:00.468
- [Speaker 2] We're

56:00.468 --> 56:01.860
Yeah.

56:01.860 --> 56:03.169
- [Harrison] You guys good?

56:03.169 --> 56:05.084
Just breathe.

56:05.084 --> 56:07.070
- [Jimenes] Okay. (Breathes heavily)

56:07.070 --> 56:08.571
- [Harrison] Jesus Chr-

56:08.571 --> 56:09.738
What the fuck?

56:11.436 --> 56:12.799
What the fuck?

56:12.799 --> 56:16.120
Guys, you're still with me, right?

56:16.120 --> 56:17.670
We're still good?

56:17.670 --> 56:18.930
Everybody's good?

56:18.930 --> 56:19.763
Just breathe.

56:22.391 --> 56:23.573
Where are we, where are we,

56:23.573 --> 56:24.960
where are we, where are we?

56:24.960 --> 56:27.560
- [Speaker 2] This is the
facility manager's office.

56:28.940 --> 56:31.080
(papers rustling)

56:31.080 --> 56:32.130
What are you doing?

56:32.130 --> 56:34.558
- Well you said this is the
manager facility office, right?

56:34.558 --> 56:35.760
So there has to be a blueprint,

56:35.760 --> 56:38.310
freaking diagram or something
of this place, right?

56:40.350 --> 56:41.250
Right?

56:41.250 --> 56:42.083
- Yeah.

56:44.541 --> 56:46.290
- Well fucking help me look, come on!

56:46.290 --> 56:47.670
Jesus.

56:47.670 --> 56:49.067
You wanna get the fuck outta here, right?

56:49.067 --> 56:52.257
(papers rustling)

56:52.257 --> 56:53.505
What you got, Jimenes, anything?

56:53.505 --> 56:56.247
- Mm mm, there's nothing.

56:56.247 --> 56:57.647
(papers rustling)

56:57.647 --> 56:58.591
- [Speaker] Here!
- [Speaker 2] Where's that?

56:58.591 --> 56:59.641
Oh!
- [Speaker] It's right here!

56:59.641 --> 57:01.224
I think this is it.

57:02.427 --> 57:04.530
Does it look right?
- Yeah I think so.

57:04.530 --> 57:06.713
- [Harrison] All right,
there's an exit right here.

57:09.450 --> 57:11.190
- [Speaker 2] Yeah.

57:11.190 --> 57:12.833
- [Harrison] All right,
can you get us there?

57:15.415 --> 57:16.800
- I think so.

57:16.800 --> 57:17.633
- You think so?

57:17.633 --> 57:19.763
You didn't sound too
confident, can you get us here?

57:20.640 --> 57:21.473
- Yeah.

57:21.473 --> 57:22.800
- All right, we gotta find a distraction

57:22.800 --> 57:24.415
or something for all these guys out there.

57:24.415 --> 57:26.220
- Wait, I have an idea, I have an idea.

57:26.220 --> 57:27.690
- [Harrison] You have an idea?

57:27.690 --> 57:29.133
- We can use this, cellphone.

57:29.133 --> 57:30.153
- It's okay.

57:31.740 --> 57:33.273
Okay, let me take this map.

57:34.380 --> 57:35.220
You guys, stay close.

57:35.220 --> 57:37.277
We need to get outta here okay?

57:37.277 --> 57:40.110
(heavy breathing)

57:43.770 --> 57:45.137
- [Speaker] All right.

57:45.137 --> 57:47.316
- [Harrison] You guys
ready, you guys good?

57:47.316 --> 57:48.775
- [Jimenes] Let's go.
- [Harrison] All right.

57:48.775 --> 57:52.192
(door handle disengages)

58:03.853 --> 58:07.603
(music playing on cellphone)

58:20.189 --> 58:25.189
(eaters squealing,
growling in the distance)

58:52.883 --> 58:54.966
Show me that fucking map.

58:57.688 --> 58:58.771
Where are we?

59:00.169 --> 59:01.502
Is that the way?

59:03.307 --> 59:04.390
Where are we?

59:05.507 --> 59:07.188
Is that the way?

59:07.188 --> 59:08.557
(indistinct talking)

59:08.557 --> 59:10.496
- We're right here.
- We're right here?

59:10.496 --> 59:11.547
- All right, you guys ready?

59:11.547 --> 59:12.737
You got it?
- [Harrison] Yeah.

59:12.737 --> 59:13.570
Let's go.

59:13.570 --> 59:14.500
(eaters screaming in the distance)

59:14.500 --> 59:15.917
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

59:23.288 --> 59:25.788
(static ping)

59:36.204 --> 59:37.360
- [Speaker 2] Right here, right here!

59:37.360 --> 59:38.293
(Velcro tearing)

59:38.293 --> 59:40.287
- Let's check out this map.

59:40.287 --> 59:43.168
(paper rustling)

59:43.168 --> 59:44.215
Where we at, where we at?

59:44.215 --> 59:45.048
- Oh here, right here.

59:45.048 --> 59:48.180
- We just need to get through
here, there's the exit.

59:48.180 --> 59:49.421
- [Speaker] Oh, it's just -
- [Speaker 2] Yeah,

59:49.421 --> 59:50.254
it's just right over there.

59:50.254 --> 59:51.813
- All right, let's fucking roll.

59:55.440 --> 59:56.490
Go.

59:56.490 --> 59:59.760
- [Jimenes] Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

59:59.760 --> 1:00:01.454
- [Harrison] What, what?

1:00:01.454 --> 1:00:06.390
- Hey!

1:00:06.390 --> 1:00:07.412
What's his name, what's his name?

1:00:07.412 --> 1:00:08.591
- Zach.

1:00:08.591 --> 1:00:10.149
- Zach, hey, buddy.

1:00:10.149 --> 1:00:11.301
- [Speaker] Zach, hey.

1:00:11.301 --> 1:00:13.322
- [Harrison] Bring him
back, guys, bring him back.

1:00:13.322 --> 1:00:14.155
- Zach?

1:00:16.561 --> 1:00:17.400
(eater growls)
Hey, buddy,

1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:18.510
we found a way out, okay?

1:00:18.510 --> 1:00:19.343
Come on, we can get-

1:00:19.343 --> 1:00:20.176
Buddy?

1:00:20.176 --> 1:00:21.140
Hey, hey, hey!

1:00:21.140 --> 1:00:21.973
Oh, shit!
(eater growls)

1:00:21.973 --> 1:00:23.361
Oh, shit!
(eater growls)

1:00:23.361 --> 1:00:26.089

- [Harrison] Hit him,
hit him, hit him, back!

1:00:31.735 --> 1:00:32.568
Hit him, hit him!

1:00:32.568 --> 1:00:34.296
(loud thump)

1:00:34.296 --> 1:00:37.707
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit, oh,
shit. (breathes heavily.)

1:00:37.707 --> 1:00:39.837
- [Harrison] Fuck! Fuck!
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

1:00:39.837 --> 1:00:41.309
- You okay?

1:00:41.309 --> 1:00:42.976
(eaters growling)
Look, look, what the fuck?

1:00:42.976 --> 1:00:44.406
- [Jimenes] Go, go, go.

1:00:44.406 --> 1:00:45.843
Oh, shit.

1:00:45.843 --> 1:00:47.343
Oh, shit!
(woman screams)

1:00:47.343 --> 1:00:50.260
(eaters screaming)

1:00:51.162 --> 1:00:53.038
- [Harrison] You go, guys, go go go go!

1:00:53.038 --> 1:00:55.058
Move move move move!

1:00:55.058 --> 1:00:56.406
(chaotic screaming)

1:00:56.406 --> 1:00:58.655
Come on, let's move.

1:00:58.655 --> 1:00:59.563
What the fuck?

1:00:59.563 --> 1:01:01.114
Come on, come on, come on!

1:01:01.114 --> 1:01:01.947
(chaotic screaming continues)

1:01:01.947 --> 1:01:03.166
Jimenes, Jimenes!

1:01:03.166 --> 1:01:04.716
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

1:01:04.716 --> 1:01:05.549
- Jimenes!

1:01:08.369 --> 1:01:09.202
(taser buzzes)

1:01:09.202 --> 1:01:12.000
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
- [Jimenes] Fuck, oh shit.

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.632
Oh, shit!

1:01:13.632 --> 1:01:14.837
- [Speaker] Go, go, go!

1:01:14.837 --> 1:01:15.837
Go go go go!

1:01:17.299 --> 1:01:20.712
(eaters growling)
Run!

1:01:20.712 --> 1:01:22.843
- [Harrison] Move, move, move,
Jimenes, come on, let's go!

1:01:22.843 --> 1:01:26.676
(chaotic screaming continues)

1:01:53.956 --> 1:01:55.448
You good?

1:01:55.448 --> 1:01:57.587
- Oh shit, oh shit.
- Look.

1:01:57.587 --> 1:01:58.996
You guys okay?

1:01:58.996 --> 1:02:03.996
(eaters screaming,
growling in the distance)

1:02:11.491 --> 1:02:14.716
All right, they're fucking gone.

1:02:14.716 --> 1:02:15.869
You see that shit?

1:02:15.869 --> 1:02:18.810
See all those fucking wounds,
fucking blood everywhere?

1:02:18.810 --> 1:02:20.670
Fucking bite marks, what the fuck is that?

1:02:20.670 --> 1:02:23.280
- Dude, I can't believe I'm saying this.

1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:24.606
Did you see all the wounds?

1:02:24.606 --> 1:02:25.920
- [Harrison] You don't need
to say it, don't be stupid.

1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:27.406
- What if it's an infection?

1:02:27.406 --> 1:02:29.463
They all were injured somehow.

1:02:31.830 --> 1:02:34.350
What if this is being spread
by bites or something?

1:02:34.350 --> 1:02:36.570
They all had wounds on them, man.

1:02:36.570 --> 1:02:37.588
I don't know, I don't know.

1:02:37.588 --> 1:02:39.249
It's all I could think of, is bites.

1:02:39.249 --> 1:02:41.968
- Wait, am I bit? Am I bit?

1:02:41.968 --> 1:02:43.385
- [Jimenes] Shhh!

1:02:44.387 --> 1:02:45.387
- No, you're not, you're not.

1:02:45.387 --> 1:02:46.554
Calm her down!

1:02:49.962 --> 1:02:51.848
(Velcro tearing)

1:02:51.848 --> 1:02:53.467
(paper rustling)

1:02:53.467 --> 1:02:54.801
We calm? We good? We relaxed?

1:02:54.801 --> 1:02:56.898
Okay, all right, where are we?

1:02:56.898 --> 1:02:57.817
Where are we?

1:02:57.817 --> 1:02:58.650
Okay?

1:03:01.365 --> 1:03:03.992
Where are we?
- Jensen! Jensen! Jensen!

1:03:03.992 --> 1:03:06.108
(eater growls)

1:03:06.108 --> 1:03:08.285
(spine cracking)

1:03:08.285 --> 1:03:09.118
- [Harrison] What the f-

1:03:09.118 --> 1:03:11.126
(eater moaning)

1:03:11.126 --> 1:03:12.323
- [Jimenes] Watch your
back, watch your back!

1:03:12.323 --> 1:03:13.156
- Geez!

1:03:18.535 --> 1:03:21.137
(eater gurgling)

1:03:21.137 --> 1:03:23.343
- [Jimenes] They can't see us.

1:03:23.343 --> 1:03:24.468
Jensen!
- [Harrison] What?

1:03:24.468 --> 1:03:26.086
- They can't see, we can walk around it.

1:03:26.086 --> 1:03:26.968
- What?
- We can walk around it,

1:03:26.968 --> 1:03:27.926
it can't see us.
- You fucking out of your -

1:03:27.926 --> 1:03:32.343
(eater continues gurgling, grunting)

1:04:25.178 --> 1:04:26.554
- Right, where's the map?

1:04:26.554 --> 1:04:27.618
Where's the map?

1:04:27.618 --> 1:04:29.049
Right, come on, everyone, let's go.

1:04:29.049 --> 1:04:30.049
Go go go go.

1:04:33.087 --> 1:04:35.754
(eater gurgles)

1:04:39.450 --> 1:04:41.313
- [Harrison] Right, where the fuck are we?

1:04:41.313 --> 1:04:43.234
Dude, we're all fucking turned around.

1:04:43.234 --> 1:04:44.317
Where are we?

1:04:46.890 --> 1:04:47.723
Which way?

1:04:47.723 --> 1:04:49.678
- Right here, we're right here.

1:04:49.678 --> 1:04:50.859
Almost there.

1:04:50.859 --> 1:04:52.220
- [Harrison] We're almost there.

1:04:52.220 --> 1:04:53.280
- [Jimenes] We gotta move, we gotta move,

1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:54.113
we gotta move!

1:04:54.113 --> 1:04:54.946
- All right.

1:04:59.123 --> 1:05:01.623
(static ping)

1:05:03.810 --> 1:05:04.710
Come on, let's go.

1:05:10.762 --> 1:05:13.370
Come on, over here, over here.

1:05:15.345 --> 1:05:16.178
All right.

1:05:16.178 --> 1:05:17.423
All right, let's look at this.

1:05:20.040 --> 1:05:21.417
What the fuck?

1:05:21.417 --> 1:05:22.250
What room?

1:05:23.586 --> 1:05:24.693
- I'm not sure.

1:05:24.693 --> 1:05:26.776
- You're not sure, huh?

1:05:26.776 --> 1:05:28.450
(eaters groaning)

1:05:28.450 --> 1:05:30.651
- [Jimenes] Oh, shit.

1:05:30.651 --> 1:05:31.573
- Megan?

1:05:31.573 --> 1:05:33.801
- Shhh, wait.
- No no no no, it's not.

1:05:33.801 --> 1:05:35.010
- [Harrison] Stay here, stay here.

1:05:35.010 --> 1:05:37.110
- We can't just leave
or we gotta go find her.

1:05:37.110 --> 1:05:37.943
- No!

1:05:38.850 --> 1:05:40.734
If you guys go, we have
to leave without you guys.

1:05:40.734 --> 1:05:42.974
- Fuck.
- [Harrison] Wait!

1:05:42.974 --> 1:05:44.414
No, no, fuck fuck!

1:05:44.414 --> 1:05:46.013
(chaotic screaming)

1:05:46.013 --> 1:05:47.213
Jimenes!

1:05:47.213 --> 1:05:51.593
(chaotic screaming continues)

1:05:51.593 --> 1:05:52.426
- Shit, fuck.

1:05:52.426 --> 1:05:53.870
- [Harrison] No, no, Jimenes,

1:05:53.870 --> 1:05:55.922
We gotta get outta here first,
then we come back for them.

1:05:55.922 --> 1:05:56.755
Come on!

1:05:57.945 --> 1:06:00.195
- [Jimenes] Fuck!
- Jimenes!

1:06:02.514 --> 1:06:04.304
Get the fuck outta here, man.

1:06:04.304 --> 1:06:05.353
- [Jimenes] Yeah, okay.

1:06:05.353 --> 1:06:07.520
- Get the fuck outta here.

1:06:08.849 --> 1:06:10.440
Jimenes.
- Where the fuck are we going?

1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:12.107
- Let's go this way.

1:06:15.418 --> 1:06:16.698
(shrill screaming)

1:06:16.698 --> 1:06:17.531
What the fuck is that sound?

1:06:17.531 --> 1:06:19.531
You hearing this?
- Yeah.

1:06:21.385 --> 1:06:22.285
Fuck, I don't know.

1:06:22.285 --> 1:06:23.559
- Fuck, all right, come on.

1:06:23.559 --> 1:06:24.976
Let's keep going.

1:06:29.884 --> 1:06:30.784
I think we're right here.

1:06:30.784 --> 1:06:31.914
Let's go around this fucking corner.

1:06:31.914 --> 1:06:36.914
- [Jimenes] Oh shit, oh shit!
(eaters growling)

1:06:37.753 --> 1:06:38.792
(static ping)

1:06:38.792 --> 1:06:41.224
- [Harrison] Jimenes, pick up your feet!

1:06:41.224 --> 1:06:42.873
- (breathing heavily) Oh, shit!

1:06:42.873 --> 1:06:43.706
Oh shit! Oh shit!
- Jimenes, follow me,

1:06:43.706 --> 1:06:45.497
follow me, follow me!

1:06:45.497 --> 1:06:49.085
Jensen, Jensen, Jensen!
- [Harrison] Jimenes!

1:06:49.085 --> 1:06:49.918
Come on!

1:06:49.918 --> 1:06:51.974
- [Jimenes] Oh shit.

1:06:51.974 --> 1:06:52.807
Oh shit!

1:06:52.807 --> 1:06:54.785
- Jimenes, Jimenes!
- Oh shit!

1:06:54.785 --> 1:06:59.034
(chaotic eater growling)

1:06:59.034 --> 1:07:00.442
- Where are we going?
- Jimenes, I'm here, I'm here!

1:07:00.442 --> 1:07:02.109
Right, right, right!

1:07:03.876 --> 1:07:05.475
- [Jimenes] Shit, oh, oh shit.

1:07:05.475 --> 1:07:06.308
- [Harrison] Where's that map?

1:07:06.308 --> 1:07:07.225
- [Jimenes] What the fuck?

1:07:07.225 --> 1:07:10.007
- [Harrison] All right, look
at the map, look at the map!

1:07:10.007 --> 1:07:11.454
Right, right, right!

1:07:11.454 --> 1:07:14.752
(chaotic screaming, growling)

1:07:14.752 --> 1:07:18.835
- [Jimenes] Where'd you go?
- [Harrison] Jimenes!

1:07:20.837 --> 1:07:22.103
Jimenes, over here!

1:07:22.103 --> 1:07:25.186
- [Jimenes] Wait, wait, where are we?

1:07:26.249 --> 1:07:28.747
- [Harrison] I don't fucking
know where we are now.

1:07:28.747 --> 1:07:31.914
(indistinct shouting)

1:07:35.414 --> 1:07:36.997
- [Jimenes] Jensen!

1:07:39.939 --> 1:07:42.856
(muffled growling)

1:07:46.743 --> 1:07:49.755
- Jimenes, go, go, come on!

1:07:49.755 --> 1:07:51.614
Don't stop, don't stop!

1:07:51.614 --> 1:07:52.905
- [Jimenes] Right there!
- [Harrison] Fuck!

1:07:52.905 --> 1:07:54.523
(door banging)
Ah, shit.

1:07:54.523 --> 1:07:55.983
This has to be it, this has to be it!

1:07:55.983 --> 1:07:59.214
(door slams)
Fuck!

1:07:59.214 --> 1:08:02.631
(both breathing heavily)

1:08:06.781 --> 1:08:08.654
- [Jimenes] Where the fuck are we?

1:08:08.654 --> 1:08:10.154
- [Harrison] Fuck.

1:08:11.233 --> 1:08:12.066
I don't know.

1:08:12.066 --> 1:08:13.506
(Velcro tearing)
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

1:08:13.506 --> 1:08:14.339
(Paper rustling)

1:08:14.339 --> 1:08:15.900
This is supposed to be an exit, man.

1:08:15.900 --> 1:08:17.460
- Yeah, well this is where the fucking -

1:08:17.460 --> 1:08:18.896
This is where the fucking map points.

1:08:18.896 --> 1:08:20.974
- [Jimenes] Where the fuck is the exit?

1:08:20.974 --> 1:08:22.565
- [Harrison] God damn
it, dropped my torch.

1:08:22.565 --> 1:08:26.119
(indistinct frustrated talking)

1:08:26.119 --> 1:08:27.183
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

1:08:27.183 --> 1:08:31.617
- [Harrison] Fuck are we?
(siren wails briefly)

1:08:31.617 --> 1:08:34.617
(metallic rumbling)

1:08:39.552 --> 1:08:42.049
God damn, we're in a fucking elevator.

1:08:42.049 --> 1:08:43.466
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

1:08:47.468 --> 1:08:51.301
(metallic rumbling continues)

1:09:11.964 --> 1:09:14.714
(doors rumbling)

1:09:16.015 --> 1:09:18.848
(heavy breathing)

1:09:21.014 --> 1:09:22.347
- What the fuck?

1:09:24.218 --> 1:09:25.974
(doors creaking)

1:09:25.974 --> 1:09:28.434
- [Jimenes] What the hell is this place?

1:09:28.434 --> 1:09:30.934
- I don't know, what the fuck?

1:09:34.225 --> 1:09:35.058
Look.

1:09:39.804 --> 1:09:41.077
- [Jimenes] What the fuck?

1:09:41.077 --> 1:09:43.230
- [Harrison] This is some kinda facility

1:09:43.230 --> 1:09:45.633
for the fucking CDC?

1:09:48.300 --> 1:09:51.573
- But why would it be
under a homeless shelter?

1:09:53.580 --> 1:09:55.133
- [Harrison] How the fuck should I know?

1:09:57.666 --> 1:10:00.416
(paper rustling)

1:10:05.070 --> 1:10:07.440
- [Jimenes] They're doing
some sort of experiments

1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:08.273
down here.

1:10:10.958 --> 1:10:11.958
- Oh my god.

1:10:13.110 --> 1:10:16.010
They're using this place as
some kind of testing facility.

1:10:17.340 --> 1:10:18.840
All these fucking poor bastards are

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:20.130
just fucking experiments.

1:10:20.130 --> 1:10:21.393
God damn guinea pigs.

1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:27.600
- What? Fuck.
(paper rustling)

1:10:35.099 --> 1:10:39.691
What the fuck is this?

1:10:39.691 --> 1:10:41.603
- [Harrison] I don't think it's good, man.

1:10:42.930 --> 1:10:44.424
I don't think -

1:10:44.424 --> 1:10:46.623
- [Jimenes] We gotta
get outta here like now.

1:10:55.521 --> 1:10:57.711
(metallic ping)

1:10:57.711 --> 1:11:00.461
(water dripping)

1:11:03.590 --> 1:11:04.873
(Radio beeps)
- [Sergeant] Harrison,

1:11:04.873 --> 1:11:06.000
are you guys there?
- About God damn time,

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:07.410
fuck, fuck.

1:11:07.410 --> 1:11:09.180
Yeah, sarge, yeah, we're here.

1:11:10.320 --> 1:11:12.030
- [Sergeant] Look, we're all here now.

1:11:12.030 --> 1:11:14.190
We're working close with the CDC.

1:11:14.190 --> 1:11:15.900
There's some sort of case of scabies,

1:11:15.900 --> 1:11:18.090
a skin parasite, like rabies.

1:11:18.090 --> 1:11:20.130
They're working on getting quart set up

1:11:20.130 --> 1:11:22.260
before they can get you out.

1:11:22.260 --> 1:11:24.900
The health department is
preparing to enter the building.

1:11:24.900 --> 1:11:26.037
Where are you guys, exactly?

1:11:26.037 --> 1:11:27.060
- No, no no, no.

1:11:27.060 --> 1:11:28.260
- [Jimenes] Dude.
- No.

1:11:29.340 --> 1:11:31.130
- We've been exposed.

1:11:31.130 --> 1:11:33.480
If they find out that we
know what they've been doing

1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:34.548
down here, they're not
gonna let us out, man.

1:11:34.548 --> 1:11:36.640
We're a fucking liability.

1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:40.160
- Think, God damn it, think.

1:11:46.170 --> 1:11:47.700
Sarge.

1:11:47.700 --> 1:11:49.230
Yeah, Sarge, hey, we know of another exit.

1:11:49.230 --> 1:11:50.873
We're gonna head there right now.

1:11:56.060 --> 1:11:57.900
(radio beeps)
- [Sergeant] No, stay put.

1:11:57.900 --> 1:11:58.852
They want to -

1:11:58.852 --> 1:12:00.047
(loud screaming over radio)

1:12:00.047 --> 1:12:00.964
- Oh, shit.

1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:04.440
- Sarge?

1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:05.460
Sarge, come in, over?

1:12:05.460 --> 1:12:06.660
Dispatch? Try yours.

1:12:06.660 --> 1:12:08.370
Dispatch?
- [Jimenes] Sarge?

1:12:08.370 --> 1:12:10.239
Dispatch, are you guys there?

1:12:10.239 --> 1:12:11.853
- [Harrison] What the fuck?

1:12:14.610 --> 1:12:16.443
- Let's just keep moving.

1:12:17.490 --> 1:12:18.840
Let's keep pushing forward.

1:12:28.830 --> 1:12:29.913
- Jesus Christ.

1:12:32.490 --> 1:12:35.463
- I guess the CDC doesn't
believe in the housekeeping, huh?

1:12:40.308 --> 1:12:42.541
- [Jimenes] Dude, what
the fuck is this place?

1:12:42.541 --> 1:12:44.458
- Fuck, I have no idea.

1:12:56.547 --> 1:12:57.897
(strained groaning)

1:12:57.897 --> 1:12:59.470
Oh shit!
- Oh shit!

1:12:59.470 --> 1:13:01.970
What, where the fuck do we go?

1:13:09.553 --> 1:13:13.386
(strained groaning continues)

1:13:37.690 --> 1:13:39.435
(radio static)

1:13:39.435 --> 1:13:42.435
(agitated grunting)

1:13:50.582 --> 1:13:52.063
(Jimenes grunting)
(spine cracking)

1:13:52.063 --> 1:13:54.896
(heavy breathing)

1:14:01.250 --> 1:14:05.092
(multiple groans, grunts)

1:14:05.092 --> 1:14:06.925
- [Harrison] Shh, shh.

1:14:12.270 --> 1:14:15.270
(strained groaning)

1:14:41.169 --> 1:14:45.002
(strained groaning continues)

1:15:20.579 --> 1:15:23.746
(light bulb clinking)

1:15:29.905 --> 1:15:30.738
- Fuck.

1:15:31.601 --> 1:15:35.268
- [Harrison] What do
you think was in there?

1:15:53.178 --> 1:15:58.178
(door creaking)
(screen rattling)

1:16:05.929 --> 1:16:08.217
We need to find our way
back to the surface.

1:16:08.217 --> 1:16:09.962
(metal banging)
(indistinct talking)

1:16:09.962 --> 1:16:10.853
Motherfucker!

1:16:10.853 --> 1:16:12.605
- Stop, wait!

1:16:12.605 --> 1:16:14.900
I'm not affected, I'm
not one of those things.

1:16:14.900 --> 1:16:15.733
- No?

1:16:15.733 --> 1:16:16.566
Yeah, but I bet you're the motherfucker

1:16:16.566 --> 1:16:17.399
who started this shit,

1:16:17.399 --> 1:16:19.060
I just ran into your friends upstairs.

1:16:19.060 --> 1:16:20.340
- I was just doing my job!

1:16:20.340 --> 1:16:21.173
- Your job?

1:16:21.173 --> 1:16:22.310
What's that, playing God?

1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:25.530
You better start fucking talking.

1:16:25.530 --> 1:16:27.180
- You know I can't fucking say anything.

1:16:27.180 --> 1:16:28.440
- Bullshit!

1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:29.370
Fucking bullshit!

1:16:29.370 --> 1:16:30.990
You think it's good cop, bad cop?

1:16:30.990 --> 1:16:31.949
You better start talking

1:16:31.949 --> 1:16:32.820
or I'll fucking kill you right here.

1:16:32.820 --> 1:16:33.900
Do understand me?

1:16:33.900 --> 1:16:35.400
- We were just trying to help.

1:16:35.400 --> 1:16:37.050
We're finding cures for diseases.

1:16:37.050 --> 1:16:38.291
- Fuck you.

1:16:38.291 --> 1:16:39.391
You're a fucking liar.

1:16:42.420 --> 1:16:45.120
- First, first, it was just small.

1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:46.233
Small hosts.

1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:48.761
- Do you believe this shit?

1:16:48.761 --> 1:16:49.594
What?

1:16:49.594 --> 1:16:51.033
- Rabbits, rats.

1:16:52.050 --> 1:16:52.883
- But?

1:16:54.180 --> 1:16:57.060
- The higher ups wanted us to experiment

1:16:57.060 --> 1:17:00.360
with larger animals, larger hosts,

1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:02.373
cats, dogs.

1:17:03.330 --> 1:17:04.163
- Humans?

1:17:07.041 --> 1:17:08.640
- Answer him.

1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:11.063
Answer the question!
- They were terminally ill.

1:17:12.210 --> 1:17:13.290
- Bullshit.
- They were dying.

1:17:13.290 --> 1:17:14.591
It wasn't gonna go further than that.

1:17:14.591 --> 1:17:15.450
- Bullshit!

1:17:15.450 --> 1:17:18.200
You knew exactly what you
were fucking doing down here.

1:17:20.550 --> 1:17:22.890
- [Jimenes] What happened
to everyone down here?

1:17:22.890 --> 1:17:23.790
- What happened?

1:17:23.790 --> 1:17:25.053
- Specimen got loose.

1:17:25.980 --> 1:17:26.970
Affected the lead researcher.

1:17:26.970 --> 1:17:28.190
- And he didn't report it?

1:17:28.190 --> 1:17:30.361
- It affected everyone down here.

1:17:30.361 --> 1:17:33.480
- [Jimenes] Not only down here.

1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:34.980
- It reached the surface, too?

1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:39.330
We gotta get outta here.

1:17:39.330 --> 1:17:40.170
- Yeah, no shit!

1:17:40.170 --> 1:17:42.660
And you're gonna fucking show us how.

1:17:42.660 --> 1:17:44.550
- They'll never let us out of
here, we're all fucking dead!

1:17:44.550 --> 1:17:45.903
- Man, you might be.

1:17:51.826 --> 1:17:54.826
(metallic rumbling)

1:17:56.820 --> 1:18:00.900
- If the virus got out,
we're all fucking dead.

1:18:00.900 --> 1:18:01.900
- Just keep walking.

1:18:04.650 --> 1:18:06.400
- They're never gonna let us leave.

1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:10.920
- [Jimenes] No loose ends, no liabilities.

1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:12.330
- No.

1:18:12.330 --> 1:18:13.880
We're getting outta here, okay?

1:18:21.598 --> 1:18:22.904
Stop.

1:18:22.904 --> 1:18:24.321
Wait right there.

1:18:33.766 --> 1:18:36.683
(objects clanging)

1:18:54.302 --> 1:18:56.969
(metal sliding)

1:18:58.492 --> 1:19:01.185
(clanging continues)

1:19:01.185 --> 1:19:02.152
- What is it?

1:19:02.152 --> 1:19:02.985
- An exit.

1:19:05.050 --> 1:19:06.548
It's right around that door.

1:19:06.548 --> 1:19:07.381
- And?

1:19:18.366 --> 1:19:21.116
(eater growling)

1:19:25.837 --> 1:19:27.837
- What the fuck is that?

1:19:31.233 --> 1:19:33.383
What the fuck are you
guys working on here?

1:19:34.294 --> 1:19:37.044
(eater grunting)

1:19:39.043 --> 1:19:41.960
- Fucking lead us out, lead us out!

1:19:46.876 --> 1:19:47.981
Right, stay close.

1:19:47.981 --> 1:19:49.981
Quiet, stay close, okay?

1:19:57.544 --> 1:20:01.676
(Researching screaming)

1:20:01.676 --> 1:20:02.718
- [Jimenes] Oh shit.

1:20:02.718 --> 1:20:04.468
- Run, run!
- Oh shit.

1:20:05.388 --> 1:20:06.760
- [Harrison] Jimenes, pick it up!

1:20:06.760 --> 1:20:08.681
Move your feet, man, come on!

1:20:08.681 --> 1:20:12.348
- Oh fuck, oh shit!
- Pick it up, pick it up!

1:20:14.227 --> 1:20:15.660
Fuck you, fuck you!

1:20:15.660 --> 1:20:17.990
- [Jimenes] What the fuck was that?

1:20:17.990 --> 1:20:19.200
- We gotta fucking go.

1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:21.292
We gotta fucking go, come on.

1:20:21.292 --> 1:20:23.804
Come on, Jimenes!
- [Jimenes] Fuck.

1:20:23.804 --> 1:20:26.471
(metallic ping)

1:20:28.755 --> 1:20:29.905
What the fuck was that?

1:20:32.583 --> 1:20:34.333
We need to get the fuck outta here.

1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:36.353
Shit.

1:20:41.700 --> 1:20:42.533
What the fuck?

1:20:46.380 --> 1:20:47.576
Fuck are we now?

1:20:47.576 --> 1:20:49.200
(Velcro tearing)

1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:50.310
(paper rustling)
- Is this map even worth

1:20:50.310 --> 1:20:51.183
anything anymore?

1:20:57.630 --> 1:20:58.463
Is it that way?

1:21:00.450 --> 1:21:01.500
- Yeah
- Okay.

1:21:01.500 --> 1:21:02.333
Let's go.

1:21:09.464 --> 1:21:12.298
- [Harrison] Wait wait wait.

1:21:12.298 --> 1:21:13.131
05 13 85.

1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:16.296
- [Jimenes] 09 13 89.

1:21:16.296 --> 1:21:18.360
Zero five two four.

1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:19.193
Hold on.

1:21:19.193 --> 1:21:21.345
(paper rustling)

1:21:21.345 --> 1:21:22.428
- Okay, okay.

1:21:23.310 --> 1:21:24.143
All right.

1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:26.753
So.

1:21:26.753 --> 1:21:28.600
05 13 89, that's where the exit's at.

1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:30.810
So we just gotta keep
following this, right?

1:21:30.810 --> 1:21:32.463
So, all right.

1:21:33.541 --> 1:21:34.549
Go here, go
- You know where it's at?

1:21:34.549 --> 1:21:36.799
- Yeah, we need to go here.

1:21:36.799 --> 1:21:38.378
We need to go -

1:21:38.378 --> 1:21:40.627
All right, 05 13, 89, right there.

1:21:40.627 --> 1:21:43.140
We're gonna go left up
here, down the hallway,

1:21:43.140 --> 1:21:44.280
on the right, that corridor there.

1:21:44.280 --> 1:21:45.670
Exit should be there, okay?

1:21:45.670 --> 1:21:47.807
- [Jimenes] Okay, let's
go, let's go, let's just -

1:21:56.790 --> 1:21:58.178
- Where's the exit?

1:21:58.178 --> 1:22:00.232
- [Jimenes] 05 13 89 (indistinct)

1:22:00.232 --> 1:22:01.065
- Yeah, we're fine.

1:22:01.065 --> 1:22:03.540
- [Jimenes] We get the fuck
outta here, Jensen, come on.

1:22:06.308 --> 1:22:08.058
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1:22:16.176 --> 1:22:17.009
Fuck.

1:22:19.482 --> 1:22:21.815
- [Jimenes] Go, go go go go.

1:22:22.877 --> 1:22:23.983
It's right over here.

1:22:23.983 --> 1:22:24.863
- [Harrison] Come on.

1:22:24.863 --> 1:22:25.696
Come on.

1:22:25.696 --> 1:22:26.529
Come on.

1:22:27.843 --> 1:22:28.859
- [Jimenes] Wait, wait wait wait wait.

1:22:28.859 --> 1:22:30.051
- [Harrison] What?
- Wait wait wait wait.

1:22:30.051 --> 1:22:32.043
- What?
- Wait wait wait.

1:22:32.043 --> 1:22:33.057
- [Harrison] What?

1:22:33.057 --> 1:22:34.574
Hey!
- [Jimenes] Hey, hey,

1:22:34.574 --> 1:22:36.563
you need to come with us.

1:22:36.563 --> 1:22:38.394
You need to come with us, come on.

1:22:38.394 --> 1:22:40.311
What?
- [Harrison] Pete?

1:22:42.393 --> 1:22:43.226
Pete?

1:22:46.601 --> 1:22:48.934
Pete, come on man, let's go.

1:22:53.705 --> 1:22:54.596
Quit digging around

1:22:54.596 --> 1:22:55.801
this fucking ground, come on.
- You need to come with us,

1:22:55.801 --> 1:22:56.634
right now.

1:22:56.634 --> 1:22:57.617
We've found a way out.

1:22:57.617 --> 1:22:58.743
Right now, we gotta go.
