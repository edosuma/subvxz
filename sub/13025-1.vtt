Little late for visitors.

01:00.737 --> 01:04.658
I apologize. I had an appointment
with Warden Kane hours ago.

01:04.825 --> 01:06.826
Traffic was murderous.

01:06.993 --> 01:08.912
You can have an appointment
with me, darling.

01:09.079 --> 01:10.455
Hello, Miss Quinn.

01:10.622 --> 01:13.917
Uh, please,
excuse my guard's lack of manners.

01:14.084 --> 01:16.586
Around these parts,
we don't get a lot of reporters

And you want to go make things worse
by sexually harassing a journalist?

01:36.689 --> 01:39.901
Once everybody knows about this place,
we'll probably all get shitcanned.

Uh, no, no. No problem at all.

02:06.469 --> 02:09.097
- I don't bite.
- Right. Yes.

Uh, well, uh...

02:11.599 --> 02:12.934
Shall we get started?

02:13.101 --> 02:16.454
Of course. Do you mind if I record this?

02:16.604 --> 02:19.232
No, certainly not. Go right ahead.

02:19.399 --> 02:21.459
I want everything to be by the book.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.237
Uh, before we get started,

02:24.404 --> 02:28.867
has anyone warned you about this place?

02:30.743 --> 02:32.370
I don't scare easily, Mr. Kane.

02:32.537 --> 02:34.038
But thank you for your concern.

02:34.205 --> 02:37.584
Ah. Well, Miss, there are people here

I'm amazed you've been able
to keep a facility such as this

02:55.101 --> 02:56.644
hidden for so long.

02:56.811 --> 02:59.189
Well, most of the jobs
left this area years ago,

02:59.355 --> 03:03.484
so there's not much reason for people
to venture down here any longer.

03:03.693 --> 03:06.321
Although we do get the occasional
teenage devil worshippers,

03:06.487 --> 03:08.948
but they're pretty easy to scare off.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.746
On the record, why the secrecy?

03:15.955 --> 03:19.292
Other facilities for
the criminally insane exist.

03:19.459 --> 03:21.394
They don't hold people without trial.

03:21.544 --> 03:23.229
What about their rights?

03:23.379 --> 03:28.092
Well, if Gitmo can get away
with it, why shouldn't we?

03:28.259 --> 03:33.306
These monsters, they're
domestic terrorists.

03:33.473 --> 03:36.142
As far as I'm concerned,
they have no rights.

03:36.309 --> 03:38.770
I mean, do you really believe

03:38.937 --> 03:41.856
that out of the millions of
people in this country,

03:42.065 --> 03:45.818
there aren't more than just
a handful of sickos, hmm?

03:45.985 --> 03:50.365
I mean, Dahmer and Bundy and Gacy,

03:50.531 --> 03:53.218
they're just the ones
that got all the press.

03:53.368 --> 03:55.745
Here, we house the ones

03:55.912 --> 03:59.582
that you whisper about around the campfire.

03:59.749 --> 04:01.834
So killing them.

04:02.043 --> 04:03.461
Would that be the answer?

Affectionately called Animal the Cannibal.

05:00.143 --> 05:02.937
Probably heard the rumor of the famous chef

whose flank steak was to die for.

05:10.236 --> 05:13.823
Turns out he was serving

he was literally serving people, so,

Ladies nicknamed him Dr. Suave.

He was a dentist who believed that
not every tooth could be saved.
