WEBVTT

00:21.938 --> 00:22.772
Hi-yah!

01:06.608 --> 01:07.901
Come on, what's up?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.983


01:49.943 --> 01:52.445


01:53.196 --> 01:55.365
Ah, another fresh one comin' in hot.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.701
You sure you got enough meat
on this pizza there, Johnny?

01:58.785 --> 02:00.703
There's four different animals on top.

02:00.787 --> 02:01.871
That's a man's pizza.

02:03.164 --> 02:06.167


02:08.378 --> 02:11.005
Trouble in paradise?
I noticed you came in separate cars.

02:11.089 --> 02:14.050
No, we're fine.
She just wants to take things slow.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.928
Take things slow? I didn't know
that was a speed you could go.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.429
Oh yeah, wiseass?

02:19.848 --> 02:20.974
Nice catch.

02:21.057 --> 02:23.685
Hey, do you mind
taking the broccoli rabe off the stove?

02:23.768 --> 02:26.604
I wanna get a Barolo from the garage.
It's the green stuff in the pan.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.689
No problem.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.153
-Uh, what the hell are you doing here?
-I was invited.

02:34.904 --> 02:35.738
Who the hell are you?

02:37.365 --> 02:38.783
Wait, are you the son?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.869
What did you do,
switch to Whopper Juniors?

02:40.994 --> 02:43.454
It's called a growth spurt. Dipshit.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.747
Still a piece of crap.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.209
Hey, kids! Dinner! Oh, thank you.

02:49.711 --> 02:53.089
I don't think I'll ever get sick
of seeing the two of you together.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.550
Last time these two
were in a kitchen together…

02:56.301 --> 02:59.762
-I'm glad the steak knives weren't out.
-I'll drink to that.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.306
-Same.
-Perfect.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.391
So how's business?

03:03.474 --> 03:06.227
Uh, the dealership's
been the best it's been in years.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.606
It should practically be on autopilot
by the time Sam takes over. Right?

03:09.689 --> 03:12.400
-Dad…
-You're gonna take over? That's awesome.

03:12.483 --> 03:14.444
-Well--
-Nah, it's just an inside joke.

03:14.527 --> 03:18.156
When Sam was little, she used to walk
around like she owned the place.

03:18.239 --> 03:21.159
Can you blame her? She was
practically raised on that showroom floor.

03:21.659 --> 03:22.535
Almost born on it too.

03:22.619 --> 03:26.039
Hey, whatever Sam wants to do
with her life, that's entirely up to her.

03:26.122 --> 03:31.169
If she decides to go to school nearby,
get her MBA. USC, UCLA, I'm just saying…

03:31.252 --> 03:32.545
It's all icing on the cake.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.673
-So, Miguel, how's school going?
-Uh, good.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.885
-Uh, great actually.
-Straight A's this semester.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.262
-Wow.
-Yes, a total nerd.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.057
See, with grades like that
you can go anywhere you want.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.434
Yeah. I'd, uh, like to go to Stanford.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.520
That's a pretty impressive school.

03:49.604 --> 03:53.650
Yeah, I think it's like number six
in the country. The campus is beautiful.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.110
It's definitely a top choice.
But that tuition, wow.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.489
We're also thinking
about Santa Monica College, right?

03:59.572 --> 04:02.533
Save some money, live at home,
then see where we go from there.

04:03.743 --> 04:07.163
SMC's great too. It's right by the beach.
Have you checked out their campus?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.915
No, actually, I-I-I haven't.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.960
Oh, oh! Mr. LaRusso, shit!
Ah, I mean I'm sorry!

04:12.043 --> 04:15.505
No, don't worry about it.
Please. Just a little wine. Right?

04:15.588 --> 04:16.589


04:20.802 --> 04:23.846
So still okay with me
taking the Eagle Fangs tomorrow?

04:23.930 --> 04:27.016
Yeah. I had some ideas on how
to get your kids' offense up to snuff.

04:27.100 --> 04:27.934
Mm-hm.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.103
Make sure defense
doesn't turn you into a cream puff.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.521
Tomorrow is gonna be great.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.441
As long as sensei over here
brings everyone back in one piece.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.318
-No promises.
-You'd better promise.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.695
Okay, down, boys.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.571
-Goodbye, LaRussos.
-Thank you.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.906
-Take care.
-All right.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.366
-Bye.
-Hey, I'm serious.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.868
I'd better not see a scratch
on my Miyagi-Dos.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.125
<i>At Tokyo stock market yesterday,</i>

04:52.208 --> 04:53.710
<i>Nikkei stock average saw a rebound.</i>

04:53.793 --> 04:56.921
<i>It ended with 29,825.52 Yen,</i>
<i>160.79 Yen higher than last week,</i>

04:57.005 --> 04:58.965
<i>which shows 0.56% increase.</i>

04:59.048 --> 05:01.467
Will Ms. Cheyenne be joining?
I can make a second plate.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.969
No. No, not today.

05:03.678 --> 05:04.595
Very well.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.141
For breakfast,
I have prepared something special.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.617
Come on, guys. We're outta here.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.831
I owe you, man.
You saved my ass.

05:32.415 --> 05:36.294
Anything you need, I'm there for you.
Your whole life.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.672
<i>You hear me, Johnny?</i>
<i>Your whole life.</i>

05:40.965 --> 05:42.091
-Mr. Silver?
-What?

05:43.134 --> 05:46.971
Sorry. I think
I'm gonna skip breakfast today.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.973
-Should I call the doctor?
-No! No.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.726
I'm just gonna go for a little ride,
clear my head.

06:13.706 --> 06:14.832
Can I help you?

06:17.001 --> 06:18.586
I-I'm looking for Robby Keene.

06:19.587 --> 06:20.546
Mr. Keene.

06:21.631 --> 06:22.757
You have a visitor.

06:24.592 --> 06:25.802
You know this kid?

06:26.719 --> 06:28.221
I-I-I'm Kenny.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.891
My brother, Shawn Payne,
said you could help me.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.562
I didn't know
Shawn had a brother. Is he out?

06:37.146 --> 06:38.773
No. That's why I'm here.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.192
These a-holes keep hassling me.

06:41.275 --> 06:44.362
-One of them knows karate, so--
-This is a dojo.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.906
You are interrupting my class.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.450
-I'm sorry. I didn't know.
-Sensei.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.577
Shawn Payne was
one of the toughest guys in juvie.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.621
Kicked my ass a few times.

06:55.665 --> 06:59.710
You know, in the real world,
we have to fight our own battles.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.338
Cobra Kai can teach you how.

07:03.172 --> 07:05.425
But you have to prove that you're worthy.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.051
How do I do that?

07:08.469 --> 07:10.638
Take your shoes off
and get on the mat.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.355
Dude, you spilled a glass of wine.
So what?

07:19.439 --> 07:22.608
You should've heard the way Mr. LaRusso
was talking about Sam's future.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.069
I can't even afford a car,
let alone college.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.447
What if they think I'm not good enough?

07:27.530 --> 07:31.742
Dude. You're <i>El Serpiente</i>.
You're an All Valley champion.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.744
Just show Mr. LaRusso what you're made of.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.289
You're gonna crush
whatever he throws at us today.

07:36.372 --> 07:39.417
Compared to Sensei Lawrence's training,
today's gonna be a vacation.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.878
-Who's going on vacation?
-Uh, no one.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.547
-What have you got for us today?
-Come here.

07:45.590 --> 07:49.427
Now, I know
you've all been taught to strike first.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.304
What do you do

07:52.096 --> 07:53.181
when your opponent

07:54.557 --> 07:55.766
is faster than you?

07:56.350 --> 07:57.226
Are those real koi?

07:58.186 --> 07:59.187
They sure are.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.482
Today's lesson is simple.

08:03.858 --> 08:08.070
Catch a fish. But since I know
you Eagle Fangs like a bit of competition,

08:08.154 --> 08:09.822
we're gonna make it interesting.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.532
So the first to succeed

08:11.616 --> 08:12.909
will have the honor

08:13.576 --> 08:15.536
of leading class all week.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.707
And you get to pick out
what flavor Gatorade I buy next.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.752
Aw, hell yeah!
Hope you all like Glacial Freeze.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.546
-Okay, where are the rods?
-Back in my garage.

08:26.881 --> 08:30.676
Your bare hands are all you'll use
and all you'll need.

08:32.428 --> 08:33.721
On your mark.

08:34.430 --> 08:35.348
Get set.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.016
Go!

08:51.197 --> 08:53.699
Looks like
you're a little wet behind the ears.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.119
-Let's get you dried off.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.084
Where is he taking us?

09:04.085 --> 09:05.127
Nowhere good.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.673
I heard he drowned a kid in a pool
trying to teach him how to kick,

09:08.756 --> 09:11.175
and that was before
he sicced a rabid dog on Eli.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.261
This does not bode well.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.180
Let's go, Miyagis.
Move your asses!

09:30.653 --> 09:33.281
Oh God. I'm tired of being right.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.118
What are we doing here?

09:37.201 --> 09:38.661
When an eagle's hungry,

09:40.496 --> 09:41.330
it doesn't hesitate.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.376
It'll dive down
at 100 miles an hour to snatch its prey.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.338
Doesn't wait around
for a fish to jump in its feet.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.256
Talons.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.425
It's not talent. It's instinct.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.595
An eagle knows
it has to make the first move.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.932
If you want to beat Cobra Kai
in the All Valley,

10:00.683 --> 10:03.227
you gotta break yourself
of this wait-and-see crap.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.605
How exactly are we gonna do that?

10:06.856 --> 10:09.358
You're gonna jump from this roof

10:10.860 --> 10:12.111
to that one.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.488
What? Are you crazy?

10:14.572 --> 10:18.701
That building is, like, five Nates away
and we're at least 14 Nates high.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.953
Please don't use me
as a system of measurement.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.079
Quiet!

10:23.080 --> 10:26.375
If you wanna be an eagle,
first you gotta learn how to fly.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.794
You can't do that unless you jump.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.588
What if we fall?

10:30.671 --> 10:34.800
-That's what the mattresses are for.
-And if we miss the mattresses?

10:34.884 --> 10:35.885
Try not to.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.596
All right, who's first?

10:46.312 --> 10:48.189
We're not leaving 'til someone jumps.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.399
Let's go. I'll wait.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.736
Then I guess you'll be waiting
a long time. 'Cause we're not jumping.

10:57.531 --> 10:58.699
<i>All right, Mr. Payne.</i>

11:00.034 --> 11:02.453
Let's see what you got. Mr. Park?

11:08.584 --> 11:12.338
But h-how am I supposed to fight
if I haven't had any training yet?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.423
To be a Cobra Kai,

11:15.257 --> 11:17.134
you have to have a killer instinct.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.096
Fighting positions.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.684
Don't worry, man. I'll go easy on you.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.978
-Ais!
-Ha!

11:31.065 --> 11:33.359
Come back on the mat.
Grow some pubes. Let's go.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.946
It's all right, Mr. Payne.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.114
Try again.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.249
-Ais!

11:51.502 --> 11:53.421
-I've seen enough.
-Yeah, me too.

11:53.504 --> 11:56.090
-What's so funny?

11:58.008 --> 11:59.885
The All Valley's
just a few short months away.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.304
We don't have time for losers.

12:03.639 --> 12:04.682
Or cowards.

12:17.153 --> 12:20.531
I was so close to catching one.
I definitely touched scale.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.867
I know this Chinese restaurant
with a big-ass fish tank.

12:22.950 --> 12:25.578
We can go there and practice.
You, uh, comin'?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.372
Uh, nah. My mom's picking me up.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.000
All right. Well, stay dry, my friend.

12:39.842 --> 12:40.718
Hey, Ma.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.470
Yeah, you on your way?

12:44.096 --> 12:45.139
I'm still at Miyagi-Do.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.142
What? Are you okay?

12:49.685 --> 12:51.896
Okay. Uh, yeah,
I'll just catch an Uber home.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.564
Okay. Love you. Bye.

12:55.024 --> 12:55.858
Everything okay?

12:56.525 --> 12:58.778
Uh, yeah,
my mom's having some car troubles.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.948
-What kind of trouble? Can I help?
-Uh, no, she's calling a tow truck.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.702
Oh no, no. Oh no, she's not.
I know what those jackals charge.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.997
-Let me call my guys, we'll bring it in.
-That's not necessary.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.416
Miguel, I do this for a living.
Let me help.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.546
Okay. Thank you, Mr. LaRusso.

13:17.630 --> 13:21.091
It's not a problem. Okay? Come on,
I'll give you a ride to the garage.

13:30.267 --> 13:33.521
What's the problem, LaRusso?
Don't tell me you're scared of heights.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.148
-I'm not scared.
-Then what is it?

13:36.232 --> 13:37.775
Worried you're gonna muss up your hair?

13:39.276 --> 13:40.653
My dad wouldn't want us doing this.

13:40.736 --> 13:44.198
Oh, gimme a break. You do everything
your mommy and daddy tell you to?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.117
If they told you
to jump off a bridge, would you?

13:47.827 --> 13:50.830
-You're telling me to jump off a building.
-Yeah, onto another building.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.500
All I'm trying to do is help you doormats
survive the All Valley.

13:55.209 --> 13:58.045
If we do your training,
I don't think we'll survive the afternoon.

13:58.128 --> 14:01.340
Look, we came here with an open mind,
but this is dangerous.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.676
-I know what I'm doing.
-Do you?

14:03.759 --> 14:06.846
Based on your track record,
you don't have the best judgment.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.430
Oh, you wanna talk judgment?

14:08.514 --> 14:11.809
How about smashing into my Firebird
and driving off with your girlfriends?

14:11.892 --> 14:13.477
I wasn't even driving.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.856
Showing up at my place drunk,
causing your dad to kick down my door?

14:16.939 --> 14:20.609
-Guessing that wasn't your fault either.
-I'm a teenager who's made mistakes.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.696
You're a 50-something-year-old man
who lives alone, drinks all day,

14:23.779 --> 14:25.698
and clearly hasn't
figured out his own life.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.787
I figured out one thing for sure.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.207
If I did everything
my parents wanted me to do,

14:35.291 --> 14:39.003
I'd be wearing a suit and tie in some
worthless job while I wait out the clock.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.380
I didn't want that.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.968
And now I get to do what I love
every damn day.

14:48.345 --> 14:51.140
I get to try to help kids like you
find their own way.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.268
If you wanna sit
in the back seat your whole life,

14:55.728 --> 14:56.604
go right ahead.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.816
It's no sweat off my back.

15:06.614 --> 15:10.075
Good work today.
But I want better than good tomorrow.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.201
Yes, Sensei!

15:11.285 --> 15:14.246
Yo, want to stand in line with me?
Buy some new Nikes?

15:15.289 --> 15:18.292
-How many sneakers do you need?
-You would look good in Dunks.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.963
Turn around, you son of a bitch.

15:27.551 --> 15:30.095
Well, well, well. Look who's here.

15:30.596 --> 15:34.099
You know exactly what you did.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.269
I was living a perfectly happy life

15:37.353 --> 15:41.690
and you had to go mess with my head
by dredging up the past.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.026
I just reached out to an old friend.

15:44.526 --> 15:49.031
But if the past bothers you so much,
maybe you've got some unresolved issues.

15:49.114 --> 15:52.826
Mm. I told you, I got over my issues.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.078
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:54.161 --> 15:58.582
Or did you just lock those memories away
so long you forgot who you are?

15:58.666 --> 15:59.500
Was!

16:00.209 --> 16:01.335
"Was," Johnny.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.711
Oh yeah.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.380
You're a better man now.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.090
Is that why you're here?

16:06.715 --> 16:08.926
To tell me how wonderful your life is?

16:09.635 --> 16:12.846
Or did you look in the mirror
and realize what you've become?

16:14.139 --> 16:18.185
You're just an old man
in the last chapter of his life,

16:19.144 --> 16:21.480
clinging to some bullshit happy ending.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.783
Now we're talkin'.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.746
Why couldn't you let sleeping dogs lie?

16:39.623 --> 16:40.791
There are hundreds

16:40.874 --> 16:44.545
of other senseis in the Valley
that could help you win your little war.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.881
There is no one in the world
I trust more than you.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.926
This isn't my fight. Not anymore.

16:52.052 --> 16:55.097
If you believed that,
you wouldn't be standing here.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.183
You miss this, don't ya?

17:00.519 --> 17:02.271
I don't miss a goddamn thing.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.523
Bullshit.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.275
I can see it in your eyes.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.945
You've gotten this far, Terry.
What's stopping you now?

17:13.323 --> 17:14.616
Afraid you're a little rusty?

17:22.583 --> 17:23.417
Not bad.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.711
Not bad at all.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.006
I shouldn't have come.

17:30.758 --> 17:31.592
But you did.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.847
You know, not all the memories were bad.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.266
But the ones that were,

17:40.559 --> 17:41.852
we got through them together.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.316
There's still time
to finish what we started.

17:49.860 --> 17:50.944
The choice is yours.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.837
How'd you know where I lived?

18:12.508 --> 18:13.467
Thanks.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.929
So how's Shawn?
Is he still getting out this summer?

18:17.888 --> 18:21.016
They gave him an extra month
because he spit in a guard's face.

18:22.017 --> 18:26.021
Okay. Yeah, sounds like him.
Hope it was the guard in the computer lab.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.692
It's my fault.

18:31.819 --> 18:32.653
What do you mean?

18:33.904 --> 18:35.781
Shawn had some bad friends at school.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.035
I caught one of them
stealing from my parents.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.206
Guy came at me, but Shawn got between us.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.792
Beat him pretty bad.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.711
He was just defending me.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.923
With him gone, I've got no one.

18:55.634 --> 18:59.054
-That's why I was hoping you--
-Look. I can't be your tutor.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.558
-I have to focus on the All Valley.

19:07.020 --> 19:07.896
What?

19:08.522 --> 19:10.149
 <i>Oh my God!</i>
-It's nothing.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.569
Give it. Come on.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.618
- <i>Oh my God!</i>

19:25.080 --> 19:28.167
I can show you a couple of moves.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.003
Ais! Ais!

19:32.713 --> 19:36.091
Let's run it again.
I'm not gonna make contact. All right?

19:36.175 --> 19:39.511
But that means you have to stay
in the fight. All right? Bow.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.348
Fighting stance.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.767
Elbows in.

19:47.269 --> 19:50.522
Remember,
always look your opponent in the eye.

19:51.481 --> 19:52.858
Ready? Fight!

19:56.069 --> 19:57.946
Ais! Ais!

20:03.118 --> 20:05.329
I'm not sure
I buy that you're Shawn's brother.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.416
Well, Shawn was always
big and strong, okay?

20:10.500 --> 20:11.710
All I can do is run.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.923
Then use that.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.800
Instead of using your speed
to run away from your enemies,

20:18.884 --> 20:20.135
use it to run at them.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.807
Come on, let's try it again. Let's go.
Let's go, come on.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.392
Ready? Bow.

20:30.812 --> 20:34.691
So you had to run after the car
<i>and </i>jump in? What happens if you missed?

20:34.775 --> 20:37.402
I could have died
at least eight times, easy.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.614
Compared to that hunk of junk,
this is gonna be a piece of cake.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.200
Just needs a new serpentine belt.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.117
Yeah.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.620
We really appreciate
you fixing this for us.

20:47.579 --> 20:48.622
I'm not gonna do it.

20:48.705 --> 20:51.583
But don't worry,
I know a great repair guy.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.418
Really? Who?

20:57.547 --> 20:59.716
I don't know anything about fixing cars.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.927
Hey, neither did I when I was your age.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.721
Look at me now.
I'm the guy with the billboards.

21:05.806 --> 21:09.017
When I get done with you, you might have
a few billboards of your own some day.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.813
If they make billboards
for guys going to community college.

21:13.897 --> 21:16.525
-I didn't even go to college.
-Really?

21:17.526 --> 21:19.695
Yep. My mom scrimped and saved.

21:20.529 --> 21:24.408
Any spare cash she had, she put in a jar.
She called it "The Daniel Fund."

21:25.575 --> 21:26.868
So what happened?

21:26.952 --> 21:31.957
I, um, blew the entire fund
on a round trip ticket to Okinawa.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.961
What? That must have been,
like, thousands of dollars.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.964
Yeah, and they really jack up the price
when you buy it the day of.

21:40.507 --> 21:43.552
But Mr. Miyagi
had to see his father and, um…

21:44.636 --> 21:47.014
Well, I wanted to be there
for Mr. Miyagi, so…

21:49.224 --> 21:51.143
Thanks to a little ice-breaking contest,

21:51.226 --> 21:53.270
I came back
with more money than I left with.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.564
So you used that
to invest in the dealership.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.027
No, I blew that on a bonsai tree store.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.486
Don't even ask.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.114
You see, my path wasn't a straight line.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.034
And yours is still being written.

22:07.951 --> 22:10.495
I don't know. The Miguel Fund's
looking kinda sad these days.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.626
In Miyagi-Do, when an opponent
comes swinging at you,

22:16.710 --> 22:19.212
you always respond in a circular motion.

22:20.213 --> 22:23.592
Moving in the opposite direction
of what your opponent expects.

22:24.885 --> 22:25.719
Right?

22:26.845 --> 22:27.971
Life's like that too.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.682
You could reach any goal you want,

22:30.766 --> 22:32.851
it just might mean
taking the circular path.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.147
You have a good head on your shoulders.
I know you can make it happen.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.697
So no one wants to fly?

22:47.074 --> 22:49.242
You all just want to stay in the nest.

22:50.702 --> 22:51.787
Pathetic!

22:53.663 --> 22:54.623
Fine, you win.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.961
You can bore Cobra Kai into submission.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.845
You all failed.
Grab your crap and let's go.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.433
Looks like you got what you wanted.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.683
Nice move, LaRusso!

23:57.227 --> 23:58.311
Awesome!

24:41.521 --> 24:43.148
Shit, Johnny. This hurts.

24:45.984 --> 24:49.029
Don't be a pansy. It's almost over.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.037
Cool.

24:57.704 --> 24:58.788
I like it!

24:58.872 --> 24:59.748
I told you.

25:00.957 --> 25:03.460
And, uh, you're gonna like this too.

25:04.419 --> 25:07.172
It's called
the All Valley Under 18 Tournament.

25:07.255 --> 25:09.466
It started while we were away, and, uh…

25:11.635 --> 25:12.844
I entered Cobra Kai.

25:13.762 --> 25:17.224
-What? We don't have any students yet.
- We will.

25:17.307 --> 25:20.393
And this would be the perfect venue
to show the whole world

25:20.477 --> 25:23.021
that our way is the right way.

25:24.648 --> 25:25.649
What?

25:27.192 --> 25:28.276
It's my father.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.612
He wants me to take over his company.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.658
He said if I don't,
he's cutting me out of the inheritance.

25:34.741 --> 25:37.786
But what about the dojo?
We… We were just about to open it.

25:37.869 --> 25:38.870
You will.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.540
No, I can still pay
my half of the rent. Even more.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.835
-I just won't be able to be there.
-Yeah, but I can't do this without you.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.552
Terry, I can't do this without you.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.014
We started this together.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.643
We gotta see it through together.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.021
Maybe someday.

26:06.606 --> 26:10.485
My father wants me to put
all this karate and Vietnam behind me.

26:14.447 --> 26:17.158
But I don't know
if I can ever go back to a normal life.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.413
Hey, remember,

26:21.496 --> 26:22.330
fear

26:24.291 --> 26:25.375
does not exist.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.795
You can get through anything.

26:30.672 --> 26:31.590
You know why?

26:33.341 --> 26:34.259
'Cause you got me.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.305
I didn't leave you behind in the war

26:39.389 --> 26:41.308
and I'm not gonna leave you behind now.

26:46.813 --> 26:47.772
Cobra Kai?

26:52.360 --> 26:53.528
Never dies.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.197
<i>Never dies,</i>
<i>never dies.</i>

27:33.360 --> 27:36.321
<i>When an eagle's hungry,</i>
<i>it doesn't hesitate.</i>

27:39.991 --> 27:42.661
<i>An eagle knows</i>
<i>it has to make the first move.</i>

27:44.621 --> 27:46.373
<i>And you can't do that unless you jump.</i>

28:01.930 --> 28:04.307
Hey, Johnny. Uh, Miguel's not home.

28:04.391 --> 28:05.850
I'm not here for Miguel.

28:05.934 --> 28:09.562
-I know you wanna take things slow--
-Maybe we should talk about this later.

28:09.646 --> 28:10.730
I'm tired of waiting.

28:11.272 --> 28:13.191
I wanna talk about this now. With you.

28:16.277 --> 28:19.239
And your mom.
And your mom's friends. <i>Hola</i>.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.740
-Hello.
-Hello.

28:20.824 --> 28:22.909
I don't care. They can hear this.

28:23.410 --> 28:26.955
Carmen, when it comes to us,
I can't sit in the back seat any longer.

28:27.038 --> 28:31.000
It's not who I am. I'm a top down,
hair blowing in the wind kinda guy.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.546
I'm not afraid to take the leap with you.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.841
I know there's a lot of shit
to figure out,

28:37.924 --> 28:39.426
but we'll figure it out together.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.888
Don't know if they got that.
Wanna translate?

28:45.974 --> 28:47.016
I think they got it.

28:47.892 --> 28:51.187
Okay, so, just wanted you to know.

28:53.314 --> 28:56.109
And now you do,
so I'm gonna go back to my apartment.

28:56.609 --> 28:57.694
Hey, Johnny.

29:01.698 --> 29:02.532
Okay.

29:04.743 --> 29:05.577
Yeah?

29:06.286 --> 29:07.120
Yeah.

29:13.793 --> 29:17.130
He's cute.
Does he have an older brother?

29:22.844 --> 29:25.305
-That's right!
-Good job, Mr. Park.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.098
Do that all day!

29:30.268 --> 29:31.269
Look who's back for more.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.646
I want another shot.

29:35.190 --> 29:38.401
I'm sorry,
I don't have the time to teach weaklings.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.195
Give him another chance, Sensei.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.156
Maybe he'll surprise you.

29:46.367 --> 29:47.452
All right, on the mat.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.038
Mr. Park, make this quick.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.457
You got it, Sensei.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.925
-Ais!

30:05.094 --> 30:07.639
Look at him, running to mommy.
Bye, you little bitch.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.059
Oh shit.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.494
-Kid's fast.
-What the hell?

30:29.577 --> 30:32.372
He hit me when I wasn't looking.
That's some bullshit.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.582
You're right. He didn't line up.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.293
So that won't count as a point.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.671
Sorry, I didn't know the rules.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.423
That was your one chance.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.677
Okay.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.096
Where you going, Mr. Payne?

30:55.895 --> 30:57.021
Take your spot.

31:13.037 --> 31:17.166
Damn it! How do they make it
look so easy on <i>Hillbill</i>y<i> Handfishin'?</i>

31:18.042 --> 31:20.628
Agh! Shit! This is impossible!

31:20.712 --> 31:21.838
Patience.

31:21.921 --> 31:23.590
You'll figure it out.

31:31.764 --> 31:32.640
I have an idea.

31:39.772 --> 31:40.899
Come on, get in.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.151
What the…

31:49.532 --> 31:50.533
Follow my lead.

31:51.784 --> 31:52.619
Walk in a circle.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.131
It's working.
They're going under the board.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.057
We have a winner!

32:14.140 --> 32:16.184
Good job, Miguel. Good job.

32:24.317 --> 32:27.862
So? What's the plan for today?
Something else life threatening?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.906
Oh yeah, but now you're ready.

32:30.615 --> 32:34.285
Remember, if you get put
in a scary situation, you don't back down.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.622
You gotta grow a pair.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.292
Of legs. To jump.

32:42.126 --> 32:45.213
It's okay. We understand. Sensei.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.675
Let's get to work.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.768
Mr. Miyagi once told me

32:59.268 --> 33:02.981
that this represents
perseverance, courage,

33:03.773 --> 33:04.816
and strength.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.820
It also does a pretty good job
of keeping the sweat out of your eyes.

33:18.079 --> 33:18.955
Okay.

33:24.669 --> 33:25.837
What the hell?
