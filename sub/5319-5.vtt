It's a lot of money.

00:37.670 --> 00:39.990
If it gets us on TV, it's worth it.

00:41.210 --> 00:43.690
I can't believe Bishop Congdon is coming.

00:43.740 --> 00:45.960
I can't believe TV's something
we're even talking about.

00:46.010 --> 00:48.300
Yeah, believe and get ready for it.

00:48.350 --> 00:50.530
Whoo.

00:50.580 --> 00:52.200
- So guess who called?
- Hmm?

00:52.250 --> 00:55.040
Frankie and Nina. Remember
that couple we met in Denver.

00:55.090 --> 00:56.570
They had that... that pug.

00:56.620 --> 00:59.610
I remember.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.750
Well, they left a message. They're in town.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.150
They said we should meet up.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.180
You're not gonna call them back, are you?

01:07.230 --> 01:09.350
We said they should get in contact

01:09.400 --> 01:12.890
if they were ever in town.
Now you want me to ignore them?

01:12.940 --> 01:14.360
Or you could tell them that this could be

01:14.410 --> 01:17.630
the biggest weekend of your
life and you need to focus.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.670
You want to be ready for this, right?

01:21.720 --> 01:23.700
You're nervous.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.140
Don't be.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.170
♪ I want to bask in your glory ♪

01:44.340 --> 01:49.030
Never gone this long
without talking to me before.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.860
I'm not sure if it was
something I did or didn't do.

01:51.910 --> 01:53.800
Could be a good sign.

01:53.850 --> 01:57.870
You said the cop who raped Jocelyn is dead.

01:57.920 --> 02:01.040
Maybe PJ's at peace.

02:01.090 --> 02:03.940
"At peace" is a polite
way of saying "dead."

02:05.690 --> 02:07.780
I need my son awake.

Get him out of here!

03:42.090 --> 03:45.040
Hey, you should use the phone in B.

03:45.090 --> 03:46.740
Never a line there.

03:46.790 --> 03:49.010
The white phone?

03:49.060 --> 03:51.510
You want to get me fucked up
by your Peckerwood buddies?

03:51.560 --> 03:54.520
No.

03:54.570 --> 03:58.060
Well, I'll tell 'em you
paid me a pack of cigarettes.

03:58.110 --> 04:01.460
I don't have cigarettes.
I don't even have canteen.

04:01.510 --> 04:05.660
I said that's what I'd tell 'em.

04:05.710 --> 04:07.400
Oh, so this would be a favor?

04:07.450 --> 04:11.530
Man, you look like you could use a friend.

04:11.580 --> 04:15.770
No one's your friend in here
unless they want something.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.940
Maybe... You mind?

04:25.530 --> 04:30.920
In this place, sometimes a
friend helps you feel normal.

04:30.970 --> 04:34.620
You know?

04:34.670 --> 04:37.590
Yeah. I hear you.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.310
I don't understand the problem, okay?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.510
I'm talking about moving
a wire across the highway,

04:50.560 --> 04:53.310
plugging it in, and click,
turning the fucking lights on.

04:53.360 --> 04:58.980
No, technically, you're talking
about a power grid expansion.

04:59.030 --> 05:01.120
That's what it would take
in order for San Vicente

05:01.170 --> 05:03.850
to accommodate the Brooks project.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.960
Without it, you're dead in the water.

05:06.010 --> 05:07.320
Well, whatever you're talking about,

05:07.370 --> 05:09.930
you should do it at the
Conclave this weekend.

05:09.980 --> 05:11.830
The Cartesian Conclave?

05:11.880 --> 05:13.960
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that's the one.

05:14.010 --> 05:17.000
Between Brooks Innovations
and Mayor Boston,

05:17.050 --> 05:18.900
I'm confident that we can find a way

05:18.950 --> 05:20.200
to make you feel comfortable

05:20.250 --> 05:22.640
about expediting the great expansion.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.970
I've never been to the Conclave.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.640
No, neither have I, it's men only,

05:25.690 --> 05:29.710
but apparently, that's how
business gets done around here.

05:31.060 --> 05:35.190
Mr. Mayor, is Judge Harris gonna be there?

05:35.240 --> 05:37.120
Oh, the judge has some family matters

05:37.170 --> 05:38.960
that he's attending to.

05:39.010 --> 05:40.560
Oh, that's too bad.

05:40.610 --> 05:43.390
I'd really love him to be
part of this conversation.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.500
Do you think Pernell might
be able to change his plans?

05:46.550 --> 05:48.870
I mean, I bet he could use some relaxation.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.600
I'll get him there.

05:51.990 --> 05:54.140
I've always wanted to see the Conclave.

05:55.190 --> 05:57.010
Crystal knows as well as I do,

05:57.060 --> 05:58.880
if we don't have the head of the DWP

05:58.930 --> 06:00.640
in our pocket, we are fucked.

06:00.690 --> 06:02.650
She'll understand if you
have to leave for a few days.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.880
I told you, these dinners
are a big deal to her.

06:04.930 --> 06:07.890
She's been making shit
like stuffed cabbage,

06:07.940 --> 06:10.120
Cornish hen.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.790
It's been good for us,
getting focused on family.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.420
We're family too, aren't we?

06:14.470 --> 06:17.960
That's right. Listen
to your godson, Pernell.

06:18.010 --> 06:21.400
You can miss a couple of dinners.

06:21.450 --> 06:24.130
It's not just that.

06:24.180 --> 06:27.040
I'm waiting on some information
from some guy in jail.

06:27.090 --> 06:29.670
He helped Shane Caldwell cover up the rape.

06:29.720 --> 06:33.010
Please don't be talking
about this Julio Farkas.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.410
Hold up, you agreed to
let the police handle this.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.310
I also made a promise to my son.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.280
And I made a promise to
this Goldstein motherfucker.

06:40.330 --> 06:41.620
Let me ask you something,

06:41.670 --> 06:43.750
this jail they're holding Julio in,

06:43.800 --> 06:44.990
they got locks on the doors, right?

06:45.040 --> 06:46.720
Most likely.

06:46.770 --> 06:48.930
Then I'm pretty sure he'll
still be there when we get back.

06:48.980 --> 06:51.430
Look,

06:51.480 --> 06:55.970
if you can smooth it
over with Crystal, I'm in.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.700
That'll be the easy part.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.840
I'll be back in two days... less even.

07:06.890 --> 07:09.380
39 hours, give or take.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.320
It's okay, honey, you got to go.

07:12.370 --> 07:14.350
I promise I won't do anything stupid.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.750
Will you promise to
eat what I made for you?

07:16.800 --> 07:17.750
No.

07:19.010 --> 07:20.760
You're baking now?

07:20.810 --> 07:24.060
Well, I don't want to lose
this thing we got going on,

07:24.110 --> 07:27.560
and I know how you like your sweets.

07:29.580 --> 07:31.270
Wow, thanks for the tour.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.370
It's one thing knowing you're a preacher,

07:33.420 --> 07:36.710
but seeing you like this
is a whole other thing.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.480
Oh, don't get distracted by the collar.

07:38.530 --> 07:40.440
I tell everybody I'm still human,

07:40.490 --> 07:43.250
I just happen to have a
job that requires a uniform.

07:43.300 --> 07:46.250
Dude, I know who he sounds like.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.450
- Who?
- Tom Cruise.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.690
I've heard that before.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.490
Oh, fuck, totally.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.860
You kind of even look like him too.

07:53.910 --> 07:54.990
Ow.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.430
You said the F word in a church.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.030
It's fine, I've heard all the bad words.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.830
Hey.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.170
There she is.

08:02.220 --> 08:07.000
Hey, Alicia. Girl,
those boots are on fleek.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.270
What's going on?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.670
Well, Frankie's sister is having a baby,

08:10.720 --> 08:12.610
so we're driving up to
Sacramento in the morning,

08:12.660 --> 08:15.010
but we're here for
tonight, and we really want

08:15.060 --> 08:17.010
to take you guys out for dinner.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.320
That would be great,

08:18.370 --> 08:20.480
but unfortunately, we already have plans.

08:20.530 --> 08:22.020
Actually, we're having dinner

08:22.070 --> 08:24.290
with Bishop Bruce Congdon and his wife.

08:24.340 --> 08:26.060
Congdon? The TV guy?

08:26.110 --> 08:28.130
That's the one. He's thinking of adding us

08:28.180 --> 08:30.160
to his One in The Savior network.

08:30.210 --> 08:34.230
Okay, fancy. You got to celebrate, right?

08:34.280 --> 08:37.429
How about you meet us for a drink after?

08:37.480 --> 08:39.600
What do you say, a quick
cocktail afterwards?

08:39.650 --> 08:41.539
I don't think that's a good idea.

08:41.590 --> 08:43.610
He has a sermon in the morning.

08:45.460 --> 08:48.850
She's probably right. Reverend
needs his beauty sleep.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.180
Well, if you change your mind,

08:51.230 --> 08:52.580
we're staying at the Coronet.

08:52.630 --> 08:54.580
You have our number.

08:54.630 --> 08:56.350
Yeah. It was great to see you.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.660
- You too. Bye.
- Yeah.

08:58.710 --> 09:00.190
Take care.

09:13.590 --> 09:16.770
Let me take that for you, sir.

09:16.820 --> 09:19.110
Yeah.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.110
Judge Harris.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.350
How are you, Goldstein?

09:57.400 --> 09:59.120
I'm glad to see you.

09:59.170 --> 10:00.320
Here you go.

10:00.370 --> 10:03.390
Mr. Goldstein. Hey, thanks for coming.

10:03.440 --> 10:04.920
Thanks for making it happen.

10:04.970 --> 10:06.120
Did you doubt us?

10:06.170 --> 10:07.260
Just for a second.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.960
Hey, good to see you.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.330
Ah, let's toast to a good
working environment, shall we?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.560
Get a lot done.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.300
Indeed. Salut, my first time.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.900
Bobo.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.970
Yes?

10:21.020 --> 10:22.210
What's Tessa doing here?

10:22.260 --> 10:24.170
Is that a trick question?

10:24.220 --> 10:25.540
Yeah, it's just my way of saying

10:25.590 --> 10:27.110
thanks for coming, you're welcome.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.250
No. Goddamn it, this is not good.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.550
It's too much temptation.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.010
Okay, now you got me turned around.

10:32.060 --> 10:33.120
I thought you'd be happy.

10:33.170 --> 10:34.350
I can't have her in here, Bobo.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.250
I can't see her in a place like this.

10:36.300 --> 10:39.160
I wish you'd have sent me that memo.

10:39.210 --> 10:41.520
Mr. Goldstein. Salut.

10:41.570 --> 10:44.290
Salut. How's
about a game of cards?

10:44.340 --> 10:45.800
You fancy a card game, do you?

10:45.850 --> 10:47.300
I wouldn't
mind. Bring any money?

10:58.560 --> 11:00.580
Hey, man, why you always
carrying that book?

11:00.630 --> 11:05.250
Mm. Looking for answers, you know.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.180
And you think they're in there?

11:07.230 --> 11:09.520
Not all of 'em.

11:09.570 --> 11:12.990
Some of 'em are in here.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.460
No, man, you said we
were friends, no strings.

11:15.510 --> 11:17.530
I can't ask a few questions?

11:17.580 --> 11:19.200
- I knew it.
- Come on.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.200
I knew it. About what?

11:21.250 --> 11:22.830
Shane Caldwell.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.570
Dude, you better back off.

11:24.620 --> 11:26.240
I got nothing to say about that.

11:26.290 --> 11:27.670
Hey, hey, I could help you.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.210
Back the fuck off, man! I told you,

11:29.260 --> 11:31.210
I'm not fucking talking about that shit!

11:31.260 --> 11:32.780
Get the fuck away from me.

11:53.110 --> 11:56.630
Mmm. Looks tasty.

11:56.680 --> 11:59.740
Did she send enough for the whole class?

11:59.790 --> 12:01.970
It's 'cause she couldn't make me dinner.

12:02.020 --> 12:05.240
We've been eating together.

12:05.290 --> 12:06.940
Ozzie and Harriet.

12:06.990 --> 12:11.350
She's really trying. So am I.

12:11.400 --> 12:15.020
And then I see you, and...

12:16.300 --> 12:18.260
This is why I didn't want you here.

12:18.310 --> 12:20.460
Because you want me?

12:21.870 --> 12:24.130
'Cause you make me happy.

12:24.180 --> 12:28.030
'Cause you make me feel like
I actually deserve to be happy.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.070
But the Bible says...

12:32.120 --> 12:34.270
Mm.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.170
What does this say?

12:36.220 --> 12:38.440
Do you want to see me tonight?

12:40.490 --> 12:42.580
More than anything.

12:42.630 --> 12:45.280
Why does that sound like a no?

12:45.330 --> 12:49.020
'Cause I can't.

12:49.070 --> 12:53.890
'Cause it's a Commandment,
and because I love her.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.990
Love is not something you run out of.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.060
What we do doesn't have to get in the way

12:59.110 --> 13:01.860
of how you feel about Crystal.

13:01.910 --> 13:05.600
We just need to find a way to make it fit.

13:07.550 --> 13:10.640
I don't know how to do that.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.490
All right, little
closer, here we go, and...

13:25.540 --> 13:27.620
Ah.

13:27.670 --> 13:30.390
All right, yeah, we'll
post that with a shout-out.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.430
#handofgod.

13:33.950 --> 13:35.330
And you can re-gram it.

13:35.380 --> 13:38.070
You are on social, right?

13:38.120 --> 13:39.340
Oh, you bet.

13:39.390 --> 13:41.500
Instagram, Twitter, Vine, Facebook,

13:41.550 --> 13:44.540
it's really helped fuel our recent growth,

13:44.590 --> 13:47.780
but this, having you
here is the biggest thing

13:47.830 --> 13:49.910
that's ever happened
for Hand of God Chapel.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.050
Thank you.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.550
Oh. It's no charity.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.420
You got yourself on Bishop's radar.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.520
By the way,

13:59.570 --> 14:03.630
who brought Pernell Harris into the fold?

14:03.680 --> 14:05.360
You heard about Brother Harris?

14:05.410 --> 14:07.030
Word travels fast on the Christianet.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.500
Young church like yours
pops up out of nowhere,

14:09.550 --> 14:11.030
lands a big whale like that,

14:11.080 --> 14:13.240
you better believe the
Bishop's gonna hear about it.

14:13.290 --> 14:16.170
We just want to put ourselves
in the best possible position

14:16.220 --> 14:17.570
to spread the word.

14:17.620 --> 14:20.080
Every church needs a cornerstone member,

14:20.130 --> 14:21.840
and Harris is yours,

14:21.890 --> 14:24.150
and the good thing about
people who come to God late,

14:24.200 --> 14:26.880
they're always in a hurry
to make up for lost time.

14:27.870 --> 14:29.650
- You can use that.
- Yeah.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.390
He's certainly made it
clear he wants to help.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.390
Our goal now is to have a televised service

14:35.440 --> 14:37.890
by the time Easter rolls around.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.400
Hmm.

14:39.450 --> 14:42.300
Do you know what Bishop Congdon looks for

14:42.350 --> 14:43.570
in a young preacher?

14:43.620 --> 14:47.840
Someone that reminds him of himself,

14:47.890 --> 14:52.480
and I must say, I see
a little Bruce in you.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.810
Yeah, me too.

14:55.860 --> 14:57.910
I don't know, he's got that...

14:57.960 --> 14:59.820
you know what it is.

14:59.870 --> 15:01.120
He's got it.

15:01.170 --> 15:02.420
Hmm.

15:02.470 --> 15:04.650
And that's both good and bad.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.120
Ain't that right, Ida?

15:06.170 --> 15:08.160
Well, you know what they say.

15:08.210 --> 15:10.990
Every gift comes with a choice.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.700
You see, the young Bruce had a problem,

15:13.750 --> 15:16.430
separating the mission from ambition.

15:16.480 --> 15:21.040
He found that if he focused too hard

15:21.090 --> 15:22.510
on climbing the ladder,

15:22.560 --> 15:27.540
that he couldn't
faithfully spread the word.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.750
Paul's all about the mission.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.250
Hmm. How long we been sitting here?

15:32.300 --> 15:35.020
We couldn't even make
it through the appetizers

15:35.070 --> 15:37.520
without you asking me to put you on TV.

15:40.510 --> 15:44.660
I was...

15:44.710 --> 15:46.460
I was asking for pointers.

15:48.550 --> 15:51.170
What does the Bishop always say?

15:51.220 --> 15:56.270
When you're pushing God,
it's okay to have fake tits.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.680
You just can't be...

15:59.730 --> 16:01.310
full of shit.

16:11.140 --> 16:13.620
Well, I get wined and dined a lot

16:13.670 --> 16:17.530
by people who want our
business, but home cooked.

16:17.580 --> 16:19.360
This is nice.

16:19.410 --> 16:22.900
Well, I'm on a bit of a roll
in the kitchen these days,

16:22.950 --> 16:25.070
and whatever helps land the deal, right?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.500
Well, you could've just microwaved popcorn,

16:27.550 --> 16:28.640
it wouldn't matter.

16:28.690 --> 16:30.110
What do you mean?

16:30.160 --> 16:32.370
Mr. Brooks told me and
Guy to do whatever we can

16:32.420 --> 16:36.780
to keep the judge's wife
happy. CHPR's got the account.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.620
That's not good news?

16:41.670 --> 16:45.920
Uh, no, no, it's great.

16:45.970 --> 16:50.890
Is that really what Mr. Brooks
calls me, the judge's wife?

16:50.940 --> 16:52.530
Don't take it personally.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.230
When I first started at Brooks,

16:54.280 --> 16:56.730
I heard him refer to
me on multiple occasions

16:56.780 --> 16:58.230
as "the exotic one."

16:58.280 --> 17:02.200
Oh, fuck him. God, these
Silicon Valley guys,

17:02.250 --> 17:05.109
they like to pretend they're
so fucking progressive.

17:05.160 --> 17:08.210
I thought Brooks would
at least try to fake it.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.280
It really bothers you, doesn't it,

17:12.329 --> 17:14.250
being defined by Pernell?

17:16.599 --> 17:19.790
I love my husband, but...

17:19.839 --> 17:23.560
I did not get my ass into Stanford

17:23.609 --> 17:25.560
and build my business from scratch

17:25.609 --> 17:28.670
so I could be called "the judge's wife."

17:31.150 --> 17:34.670
So is that why you've been
making deals behind his back?

17:35.660 --> 17:37.040
Excuse me?

17:37.090 --> 17:38.710
We've been looking into all the companies

17:38.760 --> 17:40.340
who snapped up land

17:40.390 --> 17:42.380
around the Brooks Innovation
site while it was still cheap.

17:42.430 --> 17:45.350
As expected, the lion's
share has some connection

17:45.400 --> 17:50.390
to the Harris family trust,
but there was one surprise.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.620
I wasn't expecting to find
that one of the companies

17:53.670 --> 17:57.790
was owned by you, and just you.

18:00.510 --> 18:03.000
I had a little pin money.

18:03.050 --> 18:07.940
Are you planning to do
something with that tidbit?

18:09.320 --> 18:11.040
Learn from it.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.510
We might never get what we earn on merit,

18:13.560 --> 18:16.380
but that doesn't mean we
can't get what we deserve.

18:19.470 --> 18:20.620
Thank you.

18:20.670 --> 18:23.620
You're welcome.

18:23.670 --> 18:27.260
Bishop Bruce, I just want to say,

18:27.310 --> 18:32.090
I am so sorry if my enthusiasm put you off.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.030
Not that you seem put off.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.670
I know an affiliation with your ministry

18:38.720 --> 18:42.070
would do wonders for our little church,

18:42.120 --> 18:45.210
and so I do apologize
if I got ahead of myself.

18:45.260 --> 18:47.280
Don't go all hound dog on me now.

18:47.330 --> 18:50.080
The Bishop is all about
grooming young churches.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.180
Just sometimes, they
need a little tough love.

18:52.230 --> 18:53.820
I'm here to follow your lead.

18:53.870 --> 18:55.480
Now, that's what I want to hear.

18:55.530 --> 18:59.690
Yes, now, if the Bishop decides
to work with your church,

18:59.740 --> 19:01.960
there are steps to take. First of all,

19:02.010 --> 19:04.690
you'll have to join our
One in the Savior council.

19:04.740 --> 19:07.660
We know, and we would
love to be a part of it.

19:07.710 --> 19:10.070
This quarter, we're raising funds

19:10.120 --> 19:12.230
for missions to West Africa.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.670
The Lord has so much work to do there.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.710
Yes, he does.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.780
You take cash?

19:23.960 --> 19:25.510
Beep, beep. Pump the brakes, little lady.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.080
Now, there is a membership
fee for One in The Savior,

19:28.130 --> 19:30.750
but you don't just get to buy your way in.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.190
You have to be invited.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.890
I see promise, but I'm still on the fence.

19:35.940 --> 19:40.230
Anything we can do to nudge
you over, you let us know.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.900
Well, you'll get your chance tomorrow

19:41.950 --> 19:44.800
when the Bishop hears you preach.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.220
We have to get permission from the Pisas.

19:59.270 --> 20:00.580
Already did.

20:00.630 --> 20:03.020
Alcala doesn't care. It's your call.

20:03.940 --> 20:05.920
You sure this guy's a pig?

20:05.970 --> 20:07.560
Everybody's saying he killed a cop.

20:07.610 --> 20:09.830
No, no, he used to wear blue,

20:09.880 --> 20:11.430
and he rang me up, so fuck him.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.300
I'm not green-lighting anything

20:13.350 --> 20:15.100
until it's confirmed.

20:15.150 --> 20:17.130
My word's not good enough anymore?

20:18.080 --> 20:20.770
Used to be. Now I'm not so sure.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.410
Hey, you can't expect employee discounts

20:23.460 --> 20:25.040
when you stop working for the company.

20:25.090 --> 20:26.780
I don't think you know my name, boy.

20:26.830 --> 20:28.280
Easy, KD.

20:28.330 --> 20:30.210
We just saw you got your
hundred percent burned off.

20:30.260 --> 20:33.150
Yeah, 'cause where it was and what it said

20:33.200 --> 20:35.320
made it kind of hard to get a job.

20:35.370 --> 20:39.190
We thought maybe it was because
you're on the Jesus tip now.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.590
Well, I'm a believer,
if that's what you mean.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.090
Oh, me too, brother.

20:43.140 --> 20:46.000
Are you "eye for an eye"
or "turn the other cheek"?

20:47.210 --> 20:50.200
Huh? What else you want
to know about me, huh?

20:50.250 --> 20:52.070
What else you want to know about me?

20:52.120 --> 20:54.700
All right, come on, now, KD.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.440
Let him go.

20:56.490 --> 20:57.940
Let him go, now,

20:57.990 --> 21:00.840
or we're gonna have a
different kind of problem.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.650
Stop getting riled up, man.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.780
We just want to make sure
we're still your family.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.450
For life.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.650
Good.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.420
If this Farkas really was a cop,

21:11.470 --> 21:13.590
we'll shove a boot so
far up that cholo's ass,

21:13.640 --> 21:16.330
he'll spit leather. All right?

21:22.050 --> 21:23.970
Fucking assholes.

21:27.950 --> 21:31.910
You got this. You got this.

21:33.930 --> 21:36.950
"Jesus preached the gospel of 'yes.'

21:37.000 --> 21:40.150
Yes, he loves you. Yes, you can.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.880
But too often I hear preachers"...

21:41.930 --> 21:45.890
People. You hear people, Paul.

21:45.940 --> 21:48.590
"Too often I hear prea...

21:48.640 --> 21:52.930
people up here on the pulpit
preaching the gospel of no.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.530
We tell you what you shouldn't do,

21:54.580 --> 21:58.940
What you can't"... No, "who you can't be.

21:58.990 --> 22:02.140
Who you can't be."

22:02.190 --> 22:03.910
"We tell you what you shouldn't do,

22:03.960 --> 22:05.610
what you... who you can't"...

22:05.660 --> 22:09.180
Fuck! Shit! Shit!

22:14.430 --> 22:19.890
Maybe you can't be a preacher.
Maybe you're full of shit.

22:19.940 --> 22:23.660
Are you full of shit?

22:25.010 --> 22:28.970
Are you crying?

22:37.160 --> 22:40.080
I'm about the mission.

22:40.130 --> 22:44.250
I'm all about the mission.

22:56.610 --> 22:59.060
What's up, preacher man?

23:05.720 --> 23:06.900
I'm betting 100.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.400
Forget it.

23:08.450 --> 23:10.370
I'm out.

23:10.420 --> 23:12.940
You got me again, fuckers. Fold.

23:12.990 --> 23:14.680
Yeah, me too. I got nothing.

23:16.330 --> 23:17.980
I see what's happening here.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.450
You're letting me win to soften me up.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.380
Nah, I don't get down like that.

23:21.430 --> 23:23.520
You're just lucky tonight, so far.

23:24.970 --> 23:29.290
Hey, uh, Pernell, that Tessie girl,

23:29.340 --> 23:31.160
she's here for you, right?

23:32.280 --> 23:33.600
No, I'm not doing that anymore.

23:33.650 --> 23:35.700
What do you mean, you don't do that?

23:35.750 --> 23:38.500
Not fucking around, trying
to live up to my vows.

23:38.550 --> 23:43.340
Oh, good for you. So, she's fair game?

23:43.390 --> 23:46.240
Because everybody was
saying that's your piece,

23:46.290 --> 23:49.250
and I was with her a
couple times last year,

23:49.300 --> 23:51.150
and oh, man.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.720
Been jerking off to
the memories ever since.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.950
Let's deal. New hand.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.220
Yeah, let's see if I can lose

23:59.270 --> 24:00.520
the rest of my kid's college fund.

24:00.570 --> 24:02.690
It's like she studied anatomy, right?

24:02.740 --> 24:06.000
She did this thing with
her tongue around my balls

24:06.050 --> 24:08.760
that was just... ohh!

24:08.810 --> 24:10.300
Okay.

24:14.090 --> 24:16.170
You know what?

24:16.220 --> 24:18.140
Maybe I will be with her tonight.

24:20.190 --> 24:23.180
Your little reminiscences?

24:23.230 --> 24:24.550
Giving me second thoughts.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.850
Oh. Now you got my hopes up.

24:27.900 --> 24:31.050
Let me ask you a question. I
do something to piss you off?

24:31.100 --> 24:32.420
I'm out.

24:32.470 --> 24:35.990
My pride has cost me enough. I fold.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.890
It's just me and you, Pernell.

24:38.940 --> 24:41.300
Hey, here's an idea,

24:41.350 --> 24:43.570
why don't we play this hand heads-up?

24:43.620 --> 24:45.730
If I win, I get to spend the night

24:45.780 --> 24:47.140
with that world-class hooker.

24:47.190 --> 24:49.010
Let's just finish the hand, guys.

24:49.060 --> 24:50.170
Can we get some more drinks over here?

24:50.220 --> 24:51.570
I raise 100,

24:51.620 --> 24:53.840
and please don't call Tessie a hooker.

24:59.170 --> 25:01.220
What, are you serious?

25:01.270 --> 25:05.350
Getting paid for sex is
the definition of a hooker.

25:06.510 --> 25:09.030
What she is is a beautiful,
intelligent woman,

25:09.080 --> 25:10.090
and I would appreciate it

25:10.140 --> 25:11.160
if you would show her some respect.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.890
Oh, my God.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.160
Are you her father?

25:14.210 --> 25:16.030
You're getting very territorial.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.430
Fuck you, Matlof.

25:19.090 --> 25:20.900
Just 'cause she chose a certain profession

25:20.950 --> 25:22.340
doesn't mean she doesn't deserve respect.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.710
Different professions

25:23.760 --> 25:26.080
deserve varying degrees of respect.

25:26.130 --> 25:27.440
I don't think we've quite dropped

25:27.490 --> 25:29.410
below the threshold for "hooker" tonight.

25:29.460 --> 25:32.750
Can we please not use that word?

25:32.800 --> 25:36.290
Okay, I just need to know,
are we playing for money

25:36.340 --> 25:39.460
or a night with a
beautiful, intelligent woman?

25:39.510 --> 25:42.060
Playing for money. All right, let's go.

25:42.110 --> 25:44.430
Nah, let's play for Tessie.

25:44.480 --> 25:47.760
If I win, you leave her
alone, tonight and forever.

25:50.450 --> 25:53.340
Fair enough. What do you got?

25:59.290 --> 26:03.180
Damn, that's quite a hand.

26:03.230 --> 26:05.510
Shame, mine's even better.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.820
It's a real shame.

26:16.940 --> 26:19.460
Whoo!

26:21.050 --> 26:22.600
Fellas.

26:22.650 --> 26:23.770
Hey.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.840
I feel the need, the need for speed.

26:29.890 --> 26:32.140
Whoo! Yeah.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.110
I will fire when I'm goddamn good and ready

26:34.160 --> 26:35.110
to fire, you got that?

26:35.160 --> 26:36.110
- Yes!
- Yes!

26:36.160 --> 26:37.480
Fuck, yeah.

26:37.530 --> 26:40.920
Okay, now do... now do Jerry Maguire.

26:40.970 --> 26:43.720
Okay, uh...

26:43.770 --> 26:46.160
I don't care about endorsements.
Endorsements are easy.

26:46.210 --> 26:47.720
I'm focused on the next 20 years.

26:47.770 --> 26:50.490
Uh, uh, I want you in
your own private mansion,

26:50.540 --> 26:52.330
on your own island, named after you,

26:52.380 --> 26:54.160
with your own parrot.

26:54.210 --> 26:55.960
A parrot, a talking parrot in a gold cage,

26:56.010 --> 26:57.470
- and then every single time...
- A parrot!

26:57.520 --> 27:00.140
You walk through the door,

27:00.190 --> 27:02.870
that parrot says...

27:02.920 --> 27:04.370
"Show me the money!

27:04.420 --> 27:06.140
Show me the money! Show me the"...

27:10.000 --> 27:11.510
Shh.

27:21.270 --> 27:23.160
Shh. Shh.

27:23.210 --> 27:26.060
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

27:26.110 --> 27:27.630
- What's up?
- You okay?

27:27.680 --> 27:30.600
I think you butt-dialed me.
Heard some strange noises.

27:30.650 --> 27:33.240
Yeah, just trying to
relax and watch a movie.

27:33.290 --> 27:34.870
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.270
What movie?

27:40.890 --> 27:42.210
What the f...

27:42.260 --> 27:46.850
Hey. Do you want to party with us?

27:46.900 --> 27:48.780
Get out.

27:50.270 --> 27:52.750
Now! Or I call the police.

28:02.010 --> 28:03.770
You ready?

28:03.820 --> 28:06.200
Zzz.

28:06.250 --> 28:09.370
Hey, this is serious. The fastest way

28:09.420 --> 28:12.210
to your demographic is through their kids.

28:12.260 --> 28:14.580
Kids don't give a shit
about tech companies.

28:14.630 --> 28:16.480
Kids don't give a shit about the burger

28:16.530 --> 28:18.980
in their Happy Meals either.
They just want the toy.

28:19.030 --> 28:25.120
We are not pitching Brooks.
We're pitching Brooksy Bee.

28:25.170 --> 28:26.620
Hey, when you have kids,

28:26.670 --> 28:29.730
they dictate every decision you make.

28:29.780 --> 28:32.490
The food you eat, the car you buy,

28:32.540 --> 28:35.500
the neighborhood you live in, even...

28:35.550 --> 28:38.970
even how you feel about a company.

28:39.020 --> 28:43.340
So your son called the shots
around here when he was a kid?

28:45.290 --> 28:47.640
Uh, yeah.

28:47.690 --> 28:52.910
Yeah, PJ, he... he had a way
of getting what he wanted.

28:55.730 --> 28:58.620
He certainly made a name for
himself in the tech world.

28:58.670 --> 29:02.320
People used words like "brilliant"

29:02.370 --> 29:04.330
and "visionary."

29:04.380 --> 29:05.760
Probably "stubborn" too.

29:05.810 --> 29:08.800
Hmm. Some might call it idealistic.

29:08.850 --> 29:13.540
Wish I'd had a chance to meet him.

29:13.590 --> 29:18.570
You should. Let's go see him.

29:18.620 --> 29:20.340
You don't mean right now?

29:20.390 --> 29:21.980
Yeah, now's good. Now's great.

29:22.030 --> 29:23.510
Except you're drunk and
you shouldn't be driving.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.910
Okay, fine, you can drive.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.550
Crystal, I'm gonna call a cab for you.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.320
Fuck that! I am leaving.

29:29.370 --> 29:31.390
Up to you who drives.

29:36.840 --> 29:40.430
No, we... we... we... we...
we were just messing around.

29:40.480 --> 29:44.570
Messing around? Really?

29:44.620 --> 29:50.310
No. No. Not that... not that. Like, just...

29:50.360 --> 29:51.910
It's not even worth talking about.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.380
You were naked with two strangers, Paul.

29:54.430 --> 29:56.910
Trust me, it's worth it.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.310
We were ta...

29:58.360 --> 29:59.480
What? Speak up, Paul, I can't hear you.

29:59.530 --> 30:02.050
We were talking about the barriers

30:02.100 --> 30:05.190
that people put up, and
it turned into this...

30:05.240 --> 30:09.630
this thing about clothes and
how they're just... just...

30:09.680 --> 30:11.690
another barrier that
we use to keep ourselves

30:11.740 --> 30:13.160
from ever really seeing each other.

30:13.210 --> 30:15.600
Wow. That's deep.

30:15.650 --> 30:17.870
So that's the kind of
philosophical brilliance

30:17.920 --> 30:21.300
you come up with when
you're smoking meth, Paul?

30:21.350 --> 30:23.370
Meth?

30:23.420 --> 30:26.680
They did that. I did not touch the meth.

30:26.730 --> 30:28.440
They smoked the meth.

30:31.060 --> 30:33.550
Oh, my God.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.890
That is exactly what you said last time.

30:36.940 --> 30:39.050
Well, this time it's true,
so you know, you just...

30:39.100 --> 30:40.220
You just have to believe me.

30:40.270 --> 30:41.420
- Believe you?
- Yeah.

30:41.470 --> 30:43.360
I can't even look at you right now!

30:43.410 --> 30:46.190
You have a sermon to
give in a few hours. I...

30:46.240 --> 30:47.260
- Oh, shit!
- What?

30:47.310 --> 30:48.600
- Shit!
- What?

30:48.650 --> 30:51.400
God! The... the money's in my jacket!

30:52.480 --> 30:55.140
Are you kidding?

31:03.230 --> 31:04.810
Uh, they checked out.

31:04.860 --> 31:07.150
And they're not answering
their cell phones?

31:10.040 --> 31:11.920
Hey. Hey!

31:13.610 --> 31:17.390
"A moon, worn as if it had been a shell,

31:17.440 --> 31:18.830
Washed by time's waters

31:18.880 --> 31:23.500
as they rose and fell about the stars...

31:23.550 --> 31:28.640
and broke in days and years.

31:28.690 --> 31:33.640
I had a thought for
no one's but your ears:

31:33.690 --> 31:39.520
that you were beautiful and
that I strove to love... "

31:40.970 --> 31:46.890
Wow, uh, your pinky nail's
really out of control.

31:46.940 --> 31:49.430
Seriously, it looks
like you're a coke dealer

31:49.480 --> 31:53.600
from a bad '80s movie.

31:55.010 --> 31:57.830
You know what? I'm gonna leave it.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.840
Maybe you'll get a new nurse
and she won't know anything,

31:59.890 --> 32:02.640
and I can tell her that you got shot

32:02.690 --> 32:06.710
in a drug deal gone bad.

32:09.530 --> 32:11.650
I'm gonna leave it, okay?

32:23.040 --> 32:25.190
You know what? I think I'm
just gonna wait for you here.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.830
No, come on!

32:26.880 --> 32:28.700
You said you wanted to meet my boy.

32:28.750 --> 32:30.200
Crystal, this is crazy.

32:30.250 --> 32:34.040
Hey, come on, why should
Pernell have all the fun?

32:34.090 --> 32:36.570
Anne, meet...

32:39.560 --> 32:41.180
Oh, sorry, I didn't...

32:43.900 --> 32:46.480
Did I interrupt something?

32:46.530 --> 32:48.480
Pull!

32:49.540 --> 32:51.750
Whoo!

32:51.800 --> 32:53.620
You know I had to spend
the next couple hours

32:53.670 --> 32:55.490
drinking with that motherfucker last night,

32:55.540 --> 32:56.630
smoothing things over.

32:56.680 --> 32:57.760
Whatever I pissed out this morning

32:57.810 --> 32:58.990
smelled like gasoline.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.500
I told you I didn't want to come here.

33:00.550 --> 33:02.060
I got other shit on my mind.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.400
Look, I'm holding a gun.

33:03.450 --> 33:06.300
Do not say the name Julio
Farkas to me right now.

33:06.350 --> 33:07.870
You know what?

33:07.920 --> 33:11.170
I'm done. There you go, boss.

33:12.890 --> 33:15.980
Look, when we sit down
with Goldstein today,

33:16.030 --> 33:17.880
you gotta leave that personal
shit on the sidelines.

33:17.930 --> 33:20.050
He's a fucking prick, you know that?

33:20.100 --> 33:22.080
You hear the way he talked about Tessa?

33:22.130 --> 33:24.620
Yeah, I get it, I get it, but he
didn't know it was a hot button.

33:24.670 --> 33:25.850
Shit, I didn't know it was that hot.

33:25.900 --> 33:27.520
Okay, but that ball-licking comment

33:27.570 --> 33:29.120
was TMI under any circumstance.

33:29.170 --> 33:31.130
I mean, what if he talked
about Crystal like that?

33:31.180 --> 33:33.130
It's a teeny, tiny bit
different, don't you think?

33:33.180 --> 33:35.100
I mean, Crystal's your wife, you love her.

33:35.150 --> 33:40.540
You're just fucking Tessie, or you used to.

33:40.590 --> 33:41.940
Maybe I love Tessie too.

33:41.990 --> 33:43.940
Come on, man.

33:43.990 --> 33:45.640
How do you love her? You're
not even fucking the girl.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.580
That's 'cause I'm born again.

33:47.630 --> 33:49.040
I still see her every week.

33:49.090 --> 33:51.550
I just can't have sex
outside of my marriage.

33:55.370 --> 33:58.290
You can't be taking all
that Bible shit literally.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.890
Those rules were for
back in the day when they

33:59.940 --> 34:01.860
used to let motherfuckers
have multiple wives.

34:01.910 --> 34:03.560
Now they only let you have one,

34:03.610 --> 34:06.630
but man is still man, so he gets creative.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.100
See what I mean?

34:08.150 --> 34:10.230
Don't be confusing wanting to fuck Tessie

34:10.280 --> 34:11.570
with being in love.

34:11.620 --> 34:13.639
And please, please don't let this shit

34:13.690 --> 34:14.969
get in the way of business.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.610
We need him to sign off
on that grid expansion.

34:16.659 --> 34:20.010
Let's knock this domino
down and keep it moving.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.040
Pull.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.770
Why aren't you ready?

34:44.820 --> 34:47.840
There's nothing to be ready for.

34:56.030 --> 34:57.710
I'm not talking to you as a girl

34:57.760 --> 35:00.020
who's in love with you right now.

35:00.070 --> 35:02.880
I'm talking to you as someone
who believes in this church

35:02.930 --> 35:05.050
and does not want to see
you blow this opportunity.

35:05.100 --> 35:08.320
See me blow it? I already blew it.

35:08.370 --> 35:11.330
The money's gone. This is what I do.

35:11.380 --> 35:13.860
Just when it gets good, I mess it all up.

35:13.910 --> 35:16.260
Quit your fucking whining, Paul.

35:16.310 --> 35:19.230
Four years ago, you were
leading an honesty hour

35:19.280 --> 35:23.070
for a half a dozen kids in a YMCA basement,

35:23.120 --> 35:24.970
and now you have Bishop Bruce Congdon

35:25.020 --> 35:29.410
offering to help you get on TV.
Do you think that that's luck?

35:29.460 --> 35:33.180
Look at me.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.520
You have a gift from God.

35:37.570 --> 35:40.660
And you have to honor it.

35:40.710 --> 35:43.830
You have worked so hard.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.660
Now all you have to do
is go onto that pulpit

35:46.710 --> 35:48.260
and preach your little heart out,

35:48.310 --> 35:49.560
the easy part.

35:49.610 --> 35:52.300
It doesn't matter what I do up there.

35:52.350 --> 35:56.440
My good friends the methheads
stole the donation money.

36:00.730 --> 36:03.440
So we write a check.

36:03.490 --> 36:04.680
That we can't cover?

36:04.730 --> 36:06.950
We got this far on faith.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.780
Let's worry about the rest later.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.710
Wrong cell. I don't have canteen.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.510
They're on the house.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.080
Cops love doughnuts, right?

36:39.560 --> 36:41.820
You enjoy your dessert...

36:41.870 --> 36:44.850
Officer Farkas.

37:21.710 --> 37:24.960
Tessie.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.760
Hey.

37:27.810 --> 37:30.770
I heard you tried to win me in a card game.

37:30.820 --> 37:32.870
I tried.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.800
Is that how it is?

37:34.850 --> 37:37.070
You and a bunch of rich
white boys get together

37:37.120 --> 37:38.770
and pretend we're still living in the times

37:38.820 --> 37:40.680
when people got bought and sold?

37:40.730 --> 37:42.140
I wasn't trying to buy or sell you.

37:42.190 --> 37:43.980
Or maybe that's just how
it is with you all the time,

37:44.030 --> 37:46.920
and I'm the one pretending
like shit is different.

37:46.970 --> 37:50.290
Wait. Why are you mad at me?

37:50.340 --> 37:53.390
When you pay to see
me, that is an agreement

37:53.440 --> 37:56.320
between two consenting
adults. You don't buy me.

37:56.370 --> 37:58.060
- I know that.
- You can't win me.

37:58.110 --> 38:00.800
I wasn't trying to win you.

38:00.850 --> 38:03.100
I know you're not property.

38:03.150 --> 38:05.100
It was Goldstein was talking
about you like you were.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.700
Do some shit like that again,

38:06.750 --> 38:08.600
and that'll be the last time you see me.

38:08.650 --> 38:11.010
Don't say that.

38:14.730 --> 38:16.680
I'm sorry.

38:16.730 --> 38:20.650
Tess, Tess, don't be mad at me.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.050
I love you.

38:27.670 --> 38:29.620
Don't say anything.

38:29.670 --> 38:33.230
I know it's different
for you, it's just a job.

38:34.880 --> 38:38.070
Is that what you think it is?

38:38.120 --> 38:41.140
There are plenty of
men with money, Pernell.

38:41.190 --> 38:43.940
I like being with you,
but you are not my husband,

38:43.990 --> 38:47.340
you are not my boyfriend. There are limits.

38:49.900 --> 38:50.880
I don't want limits.

38:50.930 --> 38:52.610
That's how it is.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.960
Tess, you and Goldstein, did you...

39:01.010 --> 39:03.990
You don't get to ask that.

39:04.040 --> 39:07.860
I didn't want you to be with him.

39:07.910 --> 39:10.030
You don't get that either.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.450
I'm almost done.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.890
I just came to ask you something.

39:32.940 --> 39:34.190
If it's about last night...

39:34.240 --> 39:35.260
It's not.

39:35.310 --> 39:38.160
It's actually about something that...

39:38.210 --> 39:40.430
Something strange that Pernell said.

39:42.050 --> 39:44.400
You're gonna have to narrow that down.

39:46.050 --> 39:50.570
Do you remember him mentioning
anything about a book?

39:50.620 --> 39:53.240
He asked me if I noticed any books missing,

39:53.290 --> 39:56.010
and I thought it was
just him being bizarre.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.610
Sounds about right.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.210
But the backup drive

39:59.260 --> 40:02.120
that had PJ's Bath Water program on it

40:02.170 --> 40:05.990
is missing, and I think
that someone stole it.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.890
PJ hid the drive in a
collection of Yeats poems,

40:08.940 --> 40:09.990
and I think that that might be the book

40:10.040 --> 40:11.230
that Pernell's talking about.

40:11.280 --> 40:13.230
What does this have to do with me?

40:14.810 --> 40:17.970
I would rather not talk to Pernell.

40:18.020 --> 40:20.200
But I want to know if there's anything else

40:20.250 --> 40:21.970
that he knows about this book,

40:22.020 --> 40:24.140
and I was hoping that you could ask him.

40:26.220 --> 40:31.450
I am doing everything I
can to keep my husband sane,

40:31.500 --> 40:35.420
and feeding Pernell's delusions,
not part of the formula.

40:35.470 --> 40:38.820
I understand that, but the book was stolen.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.460
Tell the police.

40:41.770 --> 40:44.260
So what's next on your wish list?

40:44.310 --> 40:49.430
Uh... okay, this is gonna sound stupid.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.100
You're scaring me now.

40:52.550 --> 40:56.300
I... I started my PhD at
Berkeley, Applied Mathematics.

40:56.350 --> 40:59.070
Then... work, kids, you know.

40:59.120 --> 41:03.240
Now you got an honorary
degree from Cal, right?

41:03.290 --> 41:05.050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:05.100 --> 41:07.350
Is that something...

41:07.400 --> 41:09.120
You want to be Dr. Goldstein?

41:09.170 --> 41:10.490
Why not, huh?

41:10.540 --> 41:13.190
That's tricky, but it's doable.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.060
Now, are we done here?
'Cause I'm about ready

41:15.110 --> 41:16.390
to get out this lobster pot.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.390
No, not quite. I mean,
all that other shit's

41:18.440 --> 41:21.000
just window dressing.
We still haven't talked

41:21.050 --> 41:23.630
about the seat on the planning commission,

41:23.680 --> 41:26.830
and I know nobody gets on
that commission, Pernell,

41:26.880 --> 41:29.240
without your blessing.

41:31.560 --> 41:35.710
Is that something you
can make happen, Pernell?

41:35.760 --> 41:40.080
Could. Is that all you want?

41:40.130 --> 41:43.050
It's a pretty big ask.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.520
What about salvation?

41:46.100 --> 41:48.120
I don't understand. What sal...

41:48.170 --> 41:49.760
what?

41:49.810 --> 41:52.630
I can give you the keys
to the kingdom of heaven.

41:54.610 --> 41:55.730
Just kidding.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.470
You kid about something
like that? That's... no.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.470
See, this is exactly what
happens when you exceed

41:59.520 --> 42:01.540
the recommended amount of
time in this hot-ass tub.

42:01.590 --> 42:03.300
Is this about what happened last night?

42:03.350 --> 42:04.740
Because you know, if...

42:04.790 --> 42:07.610
if I offended you, I apologize.

42:07.660 --> 42:10.250
Don't forget, we were on
our fourth bottle of Cuervo.

42:10.300 --> 42:12.180
Lighten up, Goldstein.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.450
This isn't about Tessie.

42:14.500 --> 42:15.880
Oh, okay.

42:15.930 --> 42:17.490
'Cause most everybody's heard

42:17.540 --> 42:20.520
about your recent religious experience,

42:20.570 --> 42:23.490
so I wasn't sure if
you were serious or not.

42:23.540 --> 42:25.490
Hey, if you want to talk
about making Jesus Christ

42:25.540 --> 42:27.560
your lord and savior, we can do that.

42:27.610 --> 42:30.730
We don't. We want to talk about
boring, non-denominational shit

42:30.780 --> 42:34.070
like grid expansion and
mutual back-scratching.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.240
I don't know, I...

42:36.290 --> 42:37.970
I think Pernell might
be holding a grudge here.

42:38.020 --> 42:40.880
Why, 'cause your people killed Christ?

42:40.930 --> 42:42.580
Easy, I'm kidding.

42:42.630 --> 42:43.580
You need to stop.

42:43.630 --> 42:45.610
Oh, now look who's sensitive.

42:45.660 --> 42:46.750
Don't be mad at me.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.080
I just don't want you going to hell.

42:48.130 --> 42:49.620
Pernell, cut this shit out.

42:49.670 --> 42:52.090
Come on, we're just fucking around here.

42:52.140 --> 42:54.090
Right, Irwin?

42:54.140 --> 42:56.190
My people don't believe in hell.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.130
Well, that's too bad, 'cause
that's where you're going.

42:58.180 --> 42:59.730
Unless you let me baptize you.

42:59.780 --> 43:02.430
Hey, joke or not, I don't want
to do this anymore. Stop it.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.960
Come on, we could do it right here.

43:04.010 --> 43:05.330
Just say you love Jesus Christ,

43:05.380 --> 43:07.170
I dunk you in the water.

43:07.220 --> 43:09.200
Whoa, whoa, sit down, sit down.

43:09.250 --> 43:11.110
Hey, Goldstein, he's sorry.

43:11.160 --> 43:12.770
Thank God I'm not wearing my glasses.

43:12.820 --> 43:15.110
Come on, say you're sorry, Pernell.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.540
I mean, Jesus Christ, Goldstein,

43:16.590 --> 43:18.110
I'm just fucking around. Relax.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.220
Listen to me, you cocksucker.

43:20.270 --> 43:22.750
My grandmother died in
Auschwitz for her religion,

43:22.800 --> 43:24.850
and now you want to
joke about converting me

43:24.900 --> 43:28.020
because what, I shattered
your whore fantasy?

43:28.070 --> 43:29.490
Fuck you! You little prick.

43:29.540 --> 43:32.190
Fuck you and your grid expansion.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.260
I'm done with this shit.

43:37.250 --> 43:38.470
Yes!

43:38.520 --> 43:42.140
Do it again. Three, two...

43:42.190 --> 43:43.570
One in the Savior!

43:43.620 --> 43:47.210
See, that's right, because Jesus taught us

43:47.260 --> 43:51.310
that when we are one in the Savior,

43:51.360 --> 43:53.710
when we say, "Yes!" Yes!

43:53.760 --> 43:55.880
- Yes!
- Yeah!

44:00.870 --> 44:03.590
Yes, let's give God a hand, a praise, amen.

44:03.640 --> 44:04.730
Amen.

44:04.780 --> 44:06.360
Now, listen, I want to bring a man of God

44:06.410 --> 44:08.400
to the stage right now. He's gonna preach

44:08.450 --> 44:12.630
about the power and the
magic of the word "Yes."

44:12.680 --> 44:16.540
He is the leader of your
flock. He is your pastor.

44:16.590 --> 44:21.180
Let's put our hands together
for Reverend Paul Curtis!

44:26.000 --> 44:27.380
Come on!

44:36.510 --> 44:38.430
Um...

44:38.480 --> 44:41.760
Today, my... my... sermon,

44:41.810 --> 44:45.430
the message that Bishop
Bruce talked about is...

44:45.480 --> 44:49.200
is not what I'm gonna talk about.

44:49.250 --> 44:51.310
What'd he say?

44:51.360 --> 44:53.710
Reverend Paul, we can't hear you.

44:56.260 --> 45:00.220
Instead, I want to talk about...

45:00.270 --> 45:02.220
uh...

45:02.270 --> 45:06.090
shame... and secrets.

45:06.140 --> 45:10.060
You know the instant
everything changed for us?

45:10.110 --> 45:15.230
It was the instant that shame...

45:15.280 --> 45:18.830
crept into the Garden of Eden.

45:18.880 --> 45:21.240
Just like that...

45:21.290 --> 45:23.370
We became self-conscious.

45:23.420 --> 45:26.610
All of a sudden...

45:26.660 --> 45:29.440
Adam and Eve were afraid to show each other

45:29.490 --> 45:33.280
who they really were...

45:33.330 --> 45:37.050
how flawed...

45:37.100 --> 45:40.260
how human they were.

45:40.310 --> 45:42.490
So they hid themselves.

45:42.540 --> 45:48.430
We've been hiding from
each other ever since.

45:48.480 --> 45:51.570
You see, the first sin
led to the first secret,

45:51.620 --> 45:55.540
and the secret is worse
than the sin, we know that.

45:55.590 --> 45:59.270
And yet, the worst parts of us,

45:59.320 --> 46:05.050
we keep them... secret.

46:05.100 --> 46:09.620
It's hard to show people the real you...

46:09.670 --> 46:12.050
especially with someone you love.

46:17.440 --> 46:21.800
So an anonymous skirt at a bar...

46:21.850 --> 46:24.870
is the first to find out
you have a drinking problem.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.900
A cab driver whose face you never see

46:27.950 --> 46:32.010
is the first to find out
you're cheating on your husband.

46:32.060 --> 46:37.550
It's too hard to tell
people who matter, isn't it?

46:37.600 --> 46:40.980
But God, He wants it to be hard.

46:41.030 --> 46:46.120
If it weren't hard, it wouldn't be holy.

46:46.170 --> 46:48.620
Mmm.

46:51.740 --> 46:53.860
Somebody in here is hooked on meth.

46:58.780 --> 47:03.740
Somebody in here is stealing from their job

47:03.790 --> 47:05.940
to pay for their gambling.

47:05.990 --> 47:08.710
Someone in here cheated
on their spouse last night.

47:08.760 --> 47:12.810
Don't judge, just listen,
the way Jesus would.

47:12.860 --> 47:14.580
'Cause everyone has a secret,

47:14.630 --> 47:16.850
something that can only be fixed

47:16.900 --> 47:20.220
when it is exposed to the light,

47:20.270 --> 47:22.090
the light of the Lord.

47:25.410 --> 47:28.800
So tell it today.

47:28.850 --> 47:33.970
Not to a stranger, but
to someone who matters,

47:34.020 --> 47:37.040
'cause if they love you,
they will accept you,

47:37.090 --> 47:38.470
the way Jesus does,

47:38.520 --> 47:42.410
for Jesus is not afraid of who you are.

47:42.460 --> 47:45.510
Jesus is afraid of who you will become

47:45.560 --> 47:48.080
if you don't tell...

47:48.130 --> 47:50.080
your secret.

47:50.130 --> 47:51.720
That's right.

47:51.770 --> 47:55.420
So raise your hand if you're ready.

47:55.470 --> 47:57.660
Raise your hand if you're ready.

47:57.710 --> 48:00.430
Raise your hand. Now, turn to your neighbor

48:00.480 --> 48:02.400
and say "I'm ready."

48:02.450 --> 48:03.500
I'm ready.

48:03.550 --> 48:05.130
Because I'm ready!

48:05.180 --> 48:08.870
I'm ready to sit my
loved ones down and say,

48:08.920 --> 48:14.580
"I lie. I cheat. I steal.
I'm a flawed human being.

48:14.630 --> 48:17.980
I know I'm not perfect,
but as God is my witness,

48:18.030 --> 48:20.210
I'm trying to get better every day,

48:20.260 --> 48:22.720
and if you're willing to
stick with me on this journey,

48:22.770 --> 48:25.820
to truly accept me for who I am,

48:25.870 --> 48:28.790
I know someday, I will make you proud!"

48:28.840 --> 48:31.660
- Yes!
- Hallelujah!

48:31.710 --> 48:34.760
Praise God! Praise God!

48:34.810 --> 48:37.230
Jesus!

48:37.280 --> 48:38.430
- Oh!
- Jesus!

48:38.480 --> 48:39.800
Oh!

48:39.850 --> 48:41.540
Boy's on fire.

48:41.590 --> 48:43.440
That boy's on a mission.

48:43.490 --> 48:46.670
He is something, ain't he?

48:59.400 --> 49:02.960
You sure you're not gonna
cancel it this time, man?

49:03.010 --> 49:06.560
Give me one second, y'all. Sis here.

49:06.610 --> 49:09.800
What's up, sis? How was your trip?

49:09.850 --> 49:11.530
Good, how's my apartment?

49:11.580 --> 49:14.570
There was a fire, but nobody died.

49:14.620 --> 49:15.740
It'll be all right.

49:15.790 --> 49:17.300
- Can I get some love?
- Love.

49:17.350 --> 49:20.270
Hey, yo, I told this girl
at school about what you do.

49:22.030 --> 49:24.750
She trying to be a decorator too.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.480
"Girl," as in girlfriend?

49:26.530 --> 49:29.880
Huh. Far from it.

49:29.930 --> 49:32.920
She was wondering how you get your clients,

49:32.970 --> 49:36.490
you know, since you don't
have a website, or whatnot.

49:36.540 --> 49:39.490
Um, mostly word of mouth.

49:39.540 --> 49:43.100
Reputation kind of does the work for you.

49:43.150 --> 49:46.500
So, dudes are just telling their friends,

49:46.550 --> 49:49.740
"Yo, she's hot, man. Get with it"?

49:51.290 --> 49:53.610
What did you say?

49:53.660 --> 49:56.880
Come on, Tess. I know
how you get your money.

49:56.930 --> 49:59.180
I have for a long time.

50:02.600 --> 50:03.750
Ma told you?

50:03.800 --> 50:05.120
I heard her telling Aunt Lotte,

50:05.170 --> 50:08.290
like, all your boyfriends were named John.

50:08.340 --> 50:10.860
When I got older, I
figured out what that meant.

50:10.910 --> 50:13.730
She don't know shit about me.

50:16.910 --> 50:18.000
Hey.

50:20.790 --> 50:22.270
I don't judge you.

50:22.320 --> 50:24.540
I mean, I can't say I like it...

50:24.590 --> 50:25.870
It's a job.

50:26.790 --> 50:28.840
We all gotta get paid.

50:28.890 --> 50:32.580
I get more respect than their wives.

50:35.400 --> 50:37.920
Hey, yo.

50:37.970 --> 50:40.960
Any of these dudes ever get out of pocket?

50:41.010 --> 50:42.660
'Cause you know I'll fuck somebody up,

50:42.710 --> 50:44.060
they touch my sister.

50:47.380 --> 50:48.960
Shut up, gangster.

50:56.350 --> 50:59.940
How'd it go?

51:03.360 --> 51:05.480
I missed you.

51:05.530 --> 51:07.850
Oh.

51:09.470 --> 51:13.450
Aw, I missed you too.

51:13.500 --> 51:15.320
Is everything okay?

51:19.780 --> 51:22.760
Love's not something that runs out.

51:22.810 --> 51:24.700
You believe that?

51:28.350 --> 51:29.700
Me too.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.340
Hey!

52:09.190 --> 52:13.310
All inmates, lay face down,
hands behind your head.

52:16.370 --> 52:21.790
All inmates, lay face down,
hands behind your head.

52:21.840 --> 52:24.660
You gotta get out of
here. Get in that locker.

52:24.710 --> 52:27.830
Move!

52:31.880 --> 52:33.670
Let's shut it down!

52:33.720 --> 52:34.770
Everybody down!

52:34.820 --> 52:36.770
All right, all right, getting down.

52:38.290 --> 52:39.710
Push it.

52:39.760 --> 52:43.010
Aw, fuck, man, that was crazy.

52:43.060 --> 52:44.710
I thought you were trying to kill me.

52:46.260 --> 52:49.750
Had to make them think I was with them.

52:49.800 --> 52:52.050
Now what?

52:52.100 --> 52:56.260
It's gonna take them a while
to realize we're missing.

52:56.310 --> 52:59.130
When they come looking for
us, let's only ask for PC.

52:59.180 --> 53:02.230
Woods are gonna want us both dead.

53:02.280 --> 53:05.170
I'm sorry I didn't trust you before.

53:05.220 --> 53:07.870
It's just been crazy for me, man.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.700
I don't know which way's up.

53:11.320 --> 53:12.870
Hey, hey, hey.

53:12.920 --> 53:14.610
I said I could help you.

53:14.660 --> 53:17.510
I just need you to tell me
what you were doing with Shane.

53:20.230 --> 53:21.750
Ohh.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.380
- Man...
- This all right?

53:24.430 --> 53:27.390
Mm-hmm.

53:27.440 --> 53:30.160
Why don't you tell me who
you and Shane are working for?

53:30.210 --> 53:32.560
May I touch you like this?

53:32.610 --> 53:34.730
Ahh. It's comforting.

53:34.780 --> 53:37.800
Mm. Okay.

53:37.850 --> 53:41.740
Just talk to me.

53:41.790 --> 53:44.240
I'm here for you.

53:46.060 --> 53:49.280
When I think about losing her,

53:49.330 --> 53:53.750
I feel like I'm caving in on myself.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.220
That's love.

53:55.270 --> 53:58.650
If she's not your wife, it's lust.

53:58.700 --> 54:01.920
"Its flashes are flashes of fire,

54:01.970 --> 54:04.860
the very flame of the Lord."

54:08.680 --> 54:10.500
That's how I feel.

54:10.550 --> 54:15.040
The Song of Solomon is about
man's love affair with God.

54:15.090 --> 54:18.240
Now, we shouldn't do anything
to get in the way of that.

54:18.290 --> 54:21.340
Breaking a Commandment
would get in the way.

54:21.390 --> 54:23.510
If a man wants to be with
a woman who's not his wife,

54:23.560 --> 54:24.880
he's already committed adultery

54:24.930 --> 54:27.210
whether he does anything or not.

54:27.260 --> 54:29.050
You see why I need your help?

54:29.100 --> 54:31.890
I can't counsel you to commit adultery,

54:31.940 --> 54:34.120
or say it's okay if you do.

54:37.980 --> 54:40.390
I've helped you, haven't I?

54:40.440 --> 54:42.830
You've helped me. I mean, I can't begin...

54:42.880 --> 54:44.160
Warms my heart to hear that.

54:44.210 --> 54:47.800
And I want you to keep helping me.

54:47.850 --> 54:49.540
And I want to keep helping you.

54:52.320 --> 54:55.340
I'm asking you to rethink this one.

54:57.390 --> 55:00.450
Don't move, don't move. Stay on the ground.

55:02.130 --> 55:04.820
How can you not know who hired you?

55:04.870 --> 55:07.190
Uh, Shane made the contact.

55:07.240 --> 55:10.260
All I know is that they
met at an apartment,

55:10.310 --> 55:13.830
the top floor of the Eastwood Residence.

55:13.880 --> 55:15.330
Are you gonna help me?

55:15.380 --> 55:17.260
What's your number, inmate?

55:17.310 --> 55:19.930
Hey, did you know Shane
was gonna rape that girl?

55:19.980 --> 55:22.100
No. No, man.

55:22.150 --> 55:26.010
It was supposed to be
about getting that book.

55:26.060 --> 55:30.140
Shane told me what he did.

55:30.190 --> 55:33.280
He said he had no choice.

55:33.330 --> 55:37.890
Said they had dirt on him. He had a family.

55:37.940 --> 55:40.420
So did she.

55:40.470 --> 55:42.160
I didn't know he was gonna do that, man,

55:42.210 --> 55:45.130
you gotta believe me.

55:46.210 --> 55:47.900
This shit is wrong, man.

55:49.910 --> 55:51.870
Shane was my friend.

55:51.920 --> 55:52.930
Okay.

55:52.980 --> 55:54.970
I didn't kill him.

55:55.020 --> 55:59.670
I didn't.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.580
I know, I know.

56:05.300 --> 56:08.620
What? How do you know?

56:11.070 --> 56:13.390
Because I did.

56:21.950 --> 56:23.100
Hey, get down.

56:23.150 --> 56:25.900
Hey! Get down, on your knees!

56:25.950 --> 56:28.000
Show me your hands.

56:47.870 --> 56:49.820
Thank you.

56:57.510 --> 56:58.830
They're beautiful.

56:58.880 --> 57:00.430
You're beautiful.

57:06.120 --> 57:07.940
You know what happened at the retreat

57:07.990 --> 57:10.950
was only because I love you, right?

57:11.000 --> 57:15.950
I said my piece. You good with it?

57:16.000 --> 57:17.350
I am.

57:20.770 --> 57:22.120
Paul?

57:26.310 --> 57:29.630
Pernell, you know my rules.

57:31.820 --> 57:35.970
Oh, this is not a three-way.
The Reverend Paul is my pastor.

57:36.020 --> 57:37.740
It's a pleasure to meet you, Tessie.

57:37.790 --> 57:39.240
And you're here because?

57:39.290 --> 57:41.980
Paul knows how much I've been struggling

57:42.030 --> 57:43.340
with my love for you

57:43.390 --> 57:45.680
next to what it says in
the Bible about adultery,

57:45.730 --> 57:50.150
so we've been praying on it,
and we've been talking about it,

57:50.200 --> 57:53.120
and we realized, there's a way

57:53.170 --> 57:55.020
for you and I to be
together without sinning.

57:55.070 --> 57:57.260
It's so simple.

58:05.080 --> 58:06.530
Theresa Marie Graham...

58:11.060 --> 58:12.740
will you marry me?
