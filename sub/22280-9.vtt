00:06.667 --> 00:09.333
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero...

00:09.367 --> 00:11.700
When Alaskans bet against
Mother Nature,

00:11.733 --> 00:14.567
the house always wins.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.567
ANDY: Whatever Mother
Nature throws at you,
you just got to deal with it.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.667
SUE: In all the best-laid
plans, nature has
another idea.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.800
NARRATOR: The brutal freeze
threatens Andy's way of life.

00:24.833 --> 00:26.000
Almost 50 below.

00:26.033 --> 00:27.533
ANDY: I don't think
they're gonna start.

00:27.567 --> 00:30.367
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
break trail through
the bitter tundra.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.500
There is no easy,
it's all rough country.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.833
Sue Aikens braves jagged
terrain to protect her camp.

00:35.867 --> 00:38.200
If I can't get myself up,
I'm somebody's dinner.

00:38.233 --> 00:41.967
NARRATOR: And the Salitans
struggle to outsmart
their prey.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.233
We caught something
and it got away.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.233
(DOGS BARKING)

01:05.500 --> 01:08.700
CHIP: It's light winter,
the sun is up now until
9:30 at night,

01:08.733 --> 01:11.133
and it's time for us
to have our hunt on.

01:11.167 --> 01:13.267
We have long, clear days.
It's gonna be cold,

01:13.300 --> 01:15.067
but where we're going
is where all the caribou are,

01:15.067 --> 01:16.800
and wherever the caribou are,
there's fur.

01:18.267 --> 01:20.667
NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,
the transition from dark

01:20.700 --> 01:23.467
to light winter brings
more daylight and is the time

01:23.500 --> 01:26.133
to journey to Kiwalik,
where they will hunt and trap

01:26.167 --> 01:29.433
red meat and fur
for the next few months.

01:29.467 --> 01:31.233
AGNES: It's gonna be
a two weeks of pretty much

01:31.267 --> 01:32.733
everything we come across.

01:32.767 --> 01:36.933
Caribou hunting, wolf hunting,
seal hunting, fishing.

01:36.967 --> 01:38.267
You know, there's
a lot of things

01:38.300 --> 01:39.567
we expect to see out there

01:39.600 --> 01:42.800
but we're just gonna do
what comes to us.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.367
The first step we do
when we plan a trip like this

01:49.400 --> 01:51.567
is we take care
of our machines.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.067
I don't want to go out
there and think that
"Oh, I have to run

01:54.067 --> 01:55.433
"my snow machine real easy."

01:55.467 --> 01:57.667
You know, try to take it easy
on my ride and all that.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.533
Once we get out there into
the country, there is no easy.

02:00.567 --> 02:03.400
It's all just rough,
hard, cold country.

02:07.167 --> 02:08.733
CHIP: We paint the snow
machines just for simple

02:08.767 --> 02:10.433
camouflage effect.

02:10.467 --> 02:12.067
We wanna get
closer to the animals,

02:12.067 --> 02:13.533
we want the animals
to get close to us.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.733
We wear white.

02:14.767 --> 02:17.067
We're not 100 per cent
camouflaged, but we're enough

02:17.100 --> 02:19.767
to break up our outline
and deceive the animals.

02:22.200 --> 02:26.333
Get more advantage
just being concealed.

02:26.367 --> 02:28.967
The kind of white I wanted,
white as snow.

02:29.067 --> 02:31.900
Well, I think this is looking
pretty good.

02:31.933 --> 02:34.167
Looking pretty good. Wow.

02:34.767 --> 02:36.800
It's time to go.

02:36.833 --> 02:39.100
AGNES: We should be able
to make it all the way down

02:39.133 --> 02:40.700
to Kiwalik today.

02:40.733 --> 02:42.333
Its 110 miles.

02:42.367 --> 02:44.067
We leave when we do,
simply because of

02:44.067 --> 02:45.433
the way the sun is.

02:45.467 --> 02:47.467
We're travelling south,
and for quite a few hours

02:47.500 --> 02:49.833
of the day, the sun is
directly in our eyes.

02:49.867 --> 02:51.700
So basically what we do is
we either leave early

02:51.733 --> 02:53.867
in the morning, or we leave
late in the afternoon.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.133
AGNES: Be here every day
when the kids

02:55.167 --> 02:56.367
come home from school.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.400
Mm-hmm.

02:57.433 --> 03:00.633
If anything,
we're just two hours away.

03:00.667 --> 03:02.733
CHIP: We've got our kids
in the age old enough,
they can take care

03:02.767 --> 03:04.300
of themselves.
They can watch each other.

03:04.333 --> 03:05.633
They can run a house
efficiently without

03:05.667 --> 03:07.533
burning it down
or blowing it up.

03:07.567 --> 03:09.300
And we can be gone
for a couple, three,

03:09.333 --> 03:11.067
four weeks at a time
if we need to.

03:19.267 --> 03:22.133
SUE: If you only go through
the routine, and the accepted,

03:22.167 --> 03:24.700
you get the
basic script of life down,

03:24.733 --> 03:26.767
but you're short
changing yourself on

03:26.800 --> 03:28.767
all the little nuances.

03:41.467 --> 03:44.167
The closer I get to
spring, you know,
it's tough walking on

03:44.200 --> 03:47.633
some of these, uh,
snow drifts, because
you're solid, solid,

03:47.667 --> 03:49.067
and then you fall through.

03:49.067 --> 03:50.633
I used to have a couple pairs
of real nice,

03:50.667 --> 03:53.567
professional snowshoes,
but things break.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.067
So what I wanna do is, uh,
mack down some of these
willow branches

03:57.100 --> 04:00.067
and start fashioning a
couple of snowshoes.

04:00.067 --> 04:02.067
There are predators out there.

04:02.067 --> 04:04.200
And I'm 180
to 200 pounds of fun.

04:04.233 --> 04:07.633
I'm punching through the snow
and if I can't get myself up

04:08.267 --> 04:09.667
I'm somebody's dinner.

04:12.267 --> 04:18.667
Outside, out here in the
cold, things break, they're
brittle, they're frozen.

04:18.700 --> 04:23.100
So what I wanna do is get them
back inside my cubby,

04:23.133 --> 04:26.200
let them warm up
so they're pliable.

04:26.233 --> 04:30.333
If it's 20 below outside,
everything's brittle.

04:30.367 --> 04:32.733
Uh-oh, Ermie,
what does mama got?

04:34.700 --> 04:37.267
So I'm gonna
light my little stove here.

04:38.833 --> 04:41.567
I got the little heater going,
so that will add to the warmth

04:41.600 --> 04:43.500
of the room,
help speed up the process.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.133
They don't need
my help to thaw.

04:45.167 --> 04:48.067
So these will just do
their thing, I'll go do mine.

04:54.367 --> 04:57.600
While I've got the willow
branches thawing out

04:57.633 --> 05:01.067
in the Twinkie, I wanna
get up here and
check my surroundings.

05:03.267 --> 05:05.467
Is there a major predator
sitting out there?

05:05.500 --> 05:07.500
You know, I heard something
howling out that way.

05:07.533 --> 05:10.600
So looking helps me see,
what's the area

05:10.633 --> 05:12.300
I wanna go to look like?

05:12.333 --> 05:16.367
Most animals are gonna be
coming down or up the river.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.233
So what I wanna do
is cross-section it.

05:18.267 --> 05:20.767
I just wanna see
what's in my neighbourhood.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.100
Is there something out there
snarling, and falling down,

05:23.133 --> 05:24.533
and sick that I have to
deal with?

05:24.567 --> 05:27.067
So you gotta get down,
dirty and personal with it.

05:32.067 --> 05:35.067
ANDY: Big part of living
out here is gaining
a system that works

05:35.067 --> 05:37.333
for you, 'cause
it's different for everyone.

05:37.367 --> 05:40.400
And then rocking and rolling
when it's time to do it.

05:40.433 --> 05:43.467
'Cause days are short,
you just gotta
get out there and do it.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.500
Got up this morning and it was

05:55.533 --> 05:57.500
50 below at sunrise.

05:58.933 --> 06:02.400
It's, uh, warmed up to
about 40 below now.

06:02.433 --> 06:04.300
Everything has to average out.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.400
And if you don't get your cold
early in the year,

06:06.433 --> 06:08.133
you're gonna get it towards
the middle or the end

06:08.167 --> 06:11.133
of the year and that's where
we're at right now.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.900
Unfortunately, just because
it's a cold day out

06:13.933 --> 06:16.567
doesn't mean that
all the chores get

06:16.600 --> 06:18.067
put on hold around here.

06:18.067 --> 06:19.200
Every day there are chores.

06:19.233 --> 06:20.833
Dealing with dogs,
dealing with wood,

06:20.867 --> 06:22.067
dealing with water.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.767
So whatever Mother Nature
throws at you,

06:25.800 --> 06:28.500
you just gotta deal with it.

06:28.533 --> 06:31.300
I've got to get wood today.
I'm pumping a lot of wood

06:31.333 --> 06:33.500
into my stoves right now.
I'm starting to get

06:33.533 --> 06:35.600
low on wood for
my generator shack.

06:35.633 --> 06:37.933
I have to keep my batteries
warm, otherwise,

06:37.967 --> 06:39.900
it will get ruined.

06:39.933 --> 06:43.100
As much as I'd like to
hunker down at 50 below zero,

06:43.133 --> 06:45.633
that's not gonna be
the case today.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.600
I can go see if
I can't cut some wood.

06:47.633 --> 06:50.800
I'll go harness up some dogs,
head over across the river,

06:50.833 --> 06:53.100
try and get
a couple loads of wood in.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.867
I'm gonna take both chainsaws
out and hope that I can get

06:56.900 --> 06:58.700
one out of two to work today.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.333
(ANDY SPEAKING)

07:05.067 --> 07:06.500
Yeah, come on, boys! Let's go!

07:06.533 --> 07:08.167
They love nothing better than
to get out and get their

07:08.200 --> 07:10.500
-blood moving
when it's cold like this.
-(DOGS WHIMPERING)

07:10.533 --> 07:13.633
So, we're gonna use the dogs
to go haul wood.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.733
I have about four loads
with the dogs to equal one

07:16.767 --> 07:18.300
load with the snow machine.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.167
And so I gotta work
a lot more, it takes

07:20.200 --> 07:22.333
a lot more time to go out
and use the dogs,

07:22.367 --> 07:24.200
but, uh, I know it's a given.

07:24.233 --> 07:26.100
I know I'm not gonna
have to fight equipment.

07:26.133 --> 07:27.833
I know I'm not gonna
have to fight breakdowns.

07:27.867 --> 07:30.133
The only thing I gotta
worry about with the dogs

07:30.167 --> 07:32.067
is making sure that they're
taken care of well,

07:32.067 --> 07:33.733
they're well fed, they're
well hydrated,

07:33.767 --> 07:35.067
and they're in good shape.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.433
Hup! Let's go!

07:41.467 --> 07:42.667
(DOGS BARKING)

07:42.700 --> 07:44.433
Ideally I try and do this
during a little bit

07:44.467 --> 07:46.400
warmer temperatures,
even 20 below

07:46.433 --> 07:50.067
it's a big difference, but it
just didn't work out that way.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.733
So just gotta knuckle up
and go do it.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.233
ERIK: You gotta be motivated
and excited to be doing

07:58.267 --> 08:00.133
this stuff, otherwise
you quit real quick.

08:01.467 --> 08:04.067
I'm very fortunate to be able
to live where I live.

08:05.233 --> 08:07.200
And to get to see
some of the incredible things

08:07.233 --> 08:09.133
that the natural world
can show.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.300
Trapping season's been open
up here in the Brooks Range

08:23.333 --> 08:25.133
for over a month already.

08:25.167 --> 08:27.467
Martha and I haven't done
any trapping yet because
of the snow conditions.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.133
There's not enough snow
to ride the snow machines.

08:29.167 --> 08:30.633
So, we're gonna go out
and we're gonna walk

08:30.667 --> 08:32.433
some country and lay
some steel, see if

08:32.467 --> 08:34.767
we can't put up a couple pelts
for the winter.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.600
The sort of cash crop
of all Alaska trappers

08:38.633 --> 08:41.067
is to trap lynx
and to trap marten.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.567
Those two animals are
consistent producers.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.467
They're the bread and butter
of trappers.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.133
All right, babe, let's see
if this is good ice.

08:52.167 --> 08:53.367
Let me go first.

08:55.233 --> 08:57.533
The one dangerous thing about
rivers, especially ones

08:57.567 --> 09:00.167
that are really swift,
is that if you fall through,

09:00.200 --> 09:03.100
your chance of
survival is slim.

09:03.133 --> 09:04.467
So that's why
it's always good to go ahead

09:04.500 --> 09:06.867
and have somebody go across
by themselves and check

09:06.900 --> 09:09.533
the river and make sure
that the ice is safe.

09:09.567 --> 09:10.633
We're good to go.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.700
ERIK: When you're going out
in a weird year like this,

09:14.733 --> 09:17.133
not a lot of snow, not a lot
of cold weather,

09:17.167 --> 09:18.833
you gotta be careful
crossing rivers

09:18.867 --> 09:20.200
and things like that.

09:20.233 --> 09:22.433
Water is the way that you can
really get hurt in Alaska,

09:22.467 --> 09:25.167
water is the way that
you really die in Alaska.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.700
So this is where I had
a cubby set in past years.

09:34.733 --> 09:38.233
(SNIFFS) You can see
the cubby's still there
with the broken sticks.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.167
I've been trapping up here
for a number of years.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.067
I got a lot of steel
that's already in the woods.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.833
And we'll go
re-tent the cubbies.

09:43.867 --> 09:46.100
We'll, of course, re-bait
the traps and set them

09:46.133 --> 09:47.533
so that we can
catch some animals.

09:50.233 --> 09:53.100
So the idea of this cubby set
is that you're funnelling

09:53.133 --> 09:55.967
the animal into...

09:56.067 --> 09:57.600
To enter like this,
and the trap is,

09:57.633 --> 10:02.033
of course, in the way,
for the animal to get

10:02.067 --> 10:04.900
at the bait that we'll place
in a minute here.

10:04.933 --> 10:06.200
MARTHA: What do you
wanna use on this one?

10:06.233 --> 10:08.767
I wanna use the caribou leg
and I wanna use

10:08.800 --> 10:11.333
a part of a grouse.

10:11.367 --> 10:13.433
I saved all my grouse
from the fall time.

10:13.467 --> 10:16.367
They're a little bit
stank, not rot, but
just perfect for bait.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.833
They have a good aroma to them
and it's a great way

10:18.867 --> 10:20.767
to recycle the waste product.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.100
So what we're doing here
with this wing is we place

10:23.133 --> 10:24.900
this up here,
and what this does is

10:24.933 --> 10:26.933
it serves as a
visual attraction.

10:26.967 --> 10:30.033
We use a trapping axe and we
just lay a thin layer of snow.

10:30.067 --> 10:31.767
You never do the snow
in your hands.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.500
If it compacts,
the trap will freeze down

10:35.533 --> 10:37.567
and it won't be able
to operate properly.

10:37.600 --> 10:41.100
You know, the big hope
on this set would be to catch

10:41.133 --> 10:45.300
either a, uh, lynx
or a, uh, wolverine.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.100
But much more likely a lynx.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.200
I got that one
all, uh, squared away.

10:51.233 --> 10:54.533
-Let's go work on this
marten pole.
-Okay.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.533
ERIK: Marten the animal
that is intended to be

10:56.567 --> 10:58.700
caught in this trap.
It's in the weasel family.

10:58.733 --> 11:02.433
A good marten trapper
can catch over
200 marten in a year.

11:02.467 --> 11:04.633
The last few years,
they've been paying

11:04.667 --> 11:06.867
record high prices
for the marten.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.467
I think we're all good here.
Is that pretty tight?

11:08.500 --> 11:10.967
-Yeah.
-(SNIFFS) Let's rock
and roll the next one.

11:11.067 --> 11:12.833
On to the next!

11:12.867 --> 11:14.933
It's a lot more challenging
to trap on foot

11:14.967 --> 11:16.767
than on a snow machine.
It's pretty limited

11:16.800 --> 11:18.533
where we can go on foot.

11:27.833 --> 11:31.400
MARTHA: This sounds hollow.
ERIK: About a three-foot drop
of shelf ice there.

11:31.433 --> 11:33.100
MARTHA: I don't
wanna be on this.

11:35.733 --> 11:38.667
ERIK: Wanna avoid spots like
that. That's dangerous ice.

11:40.200 --> 11:44.767
As you live in Alaska,
you learn the dangers
around you.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.800
So one of them is definitely
the rivers and the water.

11:47.833 --> 11:51.167
How the ice sounds,
what it looks like,
the colours of the ice.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.833
ERIK: You wanna look out
for that dark ice.

11:55.867 --> 11:58.133
Dark ice is not your friend.

11:58.167 --> 12:00.067
You just gotta be careful
and know what you're doing.

12:00.633 --> 12:01.633
MARTHA: Ooh.

12:02.933 --> 12:04.500
Those are fairly fresh,
aren't they?

12:05.833 --> 12:07.067
(ERIK SPEAKING)

12:10.400 --> 12:12.300
We got a fairly fresh
lynx tracks coming

12:12.333 --> 12:14.400
right along the edge
of this beaver slough.

12:16.667 --> 12:19.067
That looks
pretty prime right there,
that tree right there.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.133
-Huh?
-Okay.

12:21.167 --> 12:23.067
MARTHA: So we're just gonna
go out on a hunch,

12:23.100 --> 12:27.300
because we saw a lot of
tracks in this area and we
haven't been seeing any.

12:27.333 --> 12:31.600
So we're just gonna
go on, uh, intuition.

12:33.867 --> 12:35.233
(ERIK GRUNTING)

12:35.267 --> 12:38.167
ERIK: You know, you wanna find
a good place to catch a cat,

12:38.200 --> 12:39.667
you look where
there's some cat tracks.

12:41.533 --> 12:45.300
This is the first new set
Martha and I have made
for the season.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.300
I feel good about this spot.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.233
It's fresh, it's new,
we're just getting started

12:49.267 --> 12:51.633
for the year.
We got some done so far today.

12:51.667 --> 12:52.800
We got a lot more to go.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.267
It gets a lot easier
to do this, you know,

12:56.300 --> 12:59.067
year after year you do
the same thing.

12:59.067 --> 13:00.533
All you gotta really do
is come and freshen up

13:00.567 --> 13:06.667
the cubby, re-bait the trap,
set the trap,

13:06.700 --> 13:08.200
you're already good to go.

13:08.633 --> 13:10.067
Let's roll.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.133
SUE: Own your own mistakes.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.067
Own your liabilities.

13:17.067 --> 13:22.133
You wouldn't last long
out here if you had to
have perfection.

13:22.167 --> 13:24.167
Nature by default
isn't perfect.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.367
Morning, Ermie.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.767
I know, I'm trashing
your world out, huh.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.367
My little branches have been
in here all night.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.867
They are as limber
as they are going to get.

13:40.900 --> 13:44.467
So I wanna start fashioning
a couple of snowshoes.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.167
NARRATOR: To scout her camp
for predators, Sue is making

13:47.200 --> 13:49.267
a pair of snowshoes
that will help her trudge

13:49.300 --> 13:51.667
through the deep snow
that surrounds her.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.900
So I apply gentle pressure
and give that branch

13:57.933 --> 14:01.500
a chance to stretch
its cells out a little.

14:01.533 --> 14:03.567
Bend it back
instead of forward.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.133
I'm asking it to do something
it doesn't really want to do.

14:06.167 --> 14:10.400
Wasn't... Didn't grow out
there saying, "Hey, I think
I'm gonna touch my bottom."

14:10.433 --> 14:11.533
(SNIFFS)

14:14.633 --> 14:17.200
I'm not always known
for being a gentle soul.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.167
-(TWIG SNAPPING)
-(GASPS)

14:21.967 --> 14:24.067
Trashed it.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.733
I didn't give them
time to stretch.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.100
That was a good one too.

14:33.067 --> 14:36.433
(GRUNTING) So again,
I'm just gonna try to work it.

14:36.467 --> 14:39.100
Suggest to it that
it needs to live in
a different direction

14:39.133 --> 14:40.433
than it normally does.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.433
When you're working it,
you'll feel where

14:42.467 --> 14:44.333
the tension is saying,
"Bitch, I'm gonna break."

14:44.367 --> 14:47.433
Now this guy's gonna be
a hard sell right there.

14:47.467 --> 14:50.800
You mother-fucker.
God damn it.

14:50.833 --> 14:53.100
Goddamn son of
a fucking whore.

14:54.900 --> 14:56.367
That was a beautiful one too.

14:58.867 --> 15:00.633
(GROANS)

15:00.667 --> 15:02.367
Trying to work this bottom
to give me a little

15:02.400 --> 15:06.333
more pliability. I want this
to bend, not this.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.233
Don't break now.

15:08.267 --> 15:09.367
(WHISPERING) Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.833
Before you break,
get your butt in there.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.067
Okay.

15:13.067 --> 15:15.133
You have a basic
hoop shape here.

15:15.167 --> 15:17.267
I just wanna lash it.

15:18.633 --> 15:20.167
Come on, my little friend.

15:24.267 --> 15:25.300
Okay.

15:26.933 --> 15:28.100
(SIGHS)

15:29.867 --> 15:32.700
Tie your little webbing,
your netting, and then you put

15:32.733 --> 15:35.100
a couple of cross members
on there and it gives you

15:35.133 --> 15:37.267
this much more flat surface.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.733
It's like giving yourself
Sue-Squatch feet.

15:44.300 --> 15:48.333
The whole purpose behind
making these little hummers

15:48.367 --> 15:51.300
is, obviously, I know
I've got foxes around.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.467
Obviously, I know I've
got some birds around.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.167
I wanna know about
those predators.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.567
I'd like to know
what's out there.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.200
And this, this hopefully
will help me get into areas

15:59.233 --> 16:01.633
I normally don't.
There you go.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.833
Your basic little snowshoe.

16:04.867 --> 16:06.233
Those are the
the two main guys,

16:06.267 --> 16:11.067
but if one breaks, doop,
you've got your other one.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.767
So I'm all set
for a morning excursion.

16:16.467 --> 16:19.400
ANDY: Cold is just a part
of the environment we live in.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.833
It's dangerous, but it's like
anything in life,

16:22.867 --> 16:24.333
if you know
what you're up against

16:24.367 --> 16:27.567
and you can prepare for it,
even though it's dangerous,

16:27.600 --> 16:28.633
it's doable.

16:33.833 --> 16:35.600
All right, let's go. Hup, hup.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.900
Yeah, buddies.

16:37.933 --> 16:41.200
NARRATOR: In order
to battle the frigid
40 below temperatures,

16:41.233 --> 16:44.233
-Andy must maintain
his wood supply.
-Hey.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.933
All right. Good job.

16:46.967 --> 16:50.067
Good boy, Coug. Good girl,
Tope.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.533
(ANDY SPEAKING)

16:55.700 --> 16:58.700
And I gotta strip down

16:58.733 --> 17:02.167
'cause I know I'm gonna
get too hot if I leave
all this on, plus it's just

17:02.200 --> 17:04.067
so bulky it's hard to work in.

17:04.600 --> 17:05.733
(GRUNTS)

17:05.767 --> 17:08.200
I'm gonna try and make this
go as quick as I can.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.967
Oh, man.

17:12.067 --> 17:15.067
(GRUNTING) I had that thing
warmed up inside the house.

17:21.867 --> 17:25.167
They don't really like
these temperatures very much.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.633
Machinery saves you
a lot of work.

17:26.667 --> 17:29.400
You can get a lot more done,
but it has its drawbacks.

17:29.433 --> 17:31.733
It's not meant to work
in this kind of cold.

17:33.233 --> 17:35.833
Shit. I got another saw.

17:35.867 --> 17:38.067
I'm gonna try that one.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.300
It's a little older saw.
Maybe the compression

17:40.333 --> 17:42.167
is not quite as tight on it.

17:46.467 --> 17:49.767
(GRUNTING) So, this saw
turns over a little easier.

17:49.800 --> 17:53.767
It's a little older saw with
a little less compression.

17:55.133 --> 17:56.767
It still doesn't wanna
really turn over.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.433
I had these things heated up
inside my house all night.

18:00.467 --> 18:03.067
Just in the amount of time
it took to get here,

18:03.600 --> 18:05.067
they stiffened up.

18:08.167 --> 18:09.967
I don't think
they're gonna start.

18:10.067 --> 18:11.500
Shit, man.

18:11.533 --> 18:13.833
I brought two hoping
I could get one going.

18:13.867 --> 18:17.133
And it looks like it's time
to build a quick fire

18:17.167 --> 18:19.433
and try and get a little bit
of warmth to them.

18:19.467 --> 18:22.400
NARRATOR: Andy is
attempting to harvest
wood to heat his camp.

18:22.433 --> 18:25.167
But brutal temperatures
have frozen his machinery,

18:25.200 --> 18:27.267
and the only solution
is the most primal

18:27.300 --> 18:29.100
and basic of skills.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.867
Probably the single
best skill to learn up here

18:31.900 --> 18:33.800
is building a fire quick.

18:33.833 --> 18:36.167
Always make sure
I have birch bark with me

18:36.200 --> 18:39.067
whenever I go outside
for times like this,

18:39.100 --> 18:40.800
I find paper matches
work better than

18:40.833 --> 18:42.433
the wood matches up here.

18:46.433 --> 18:48.900
Birch bark
catches really good.

18:48.933 --> 18:50.667
Best fire starter in nature.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.200
And it burns even if it's wet.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.267
People been living up
in this country with far less

18:56.300 --> 18:58.800
than we have now
for thousands of years.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.433
Sometimes when I'm feeling
sorry for myself I think about

19:01.467 --> 19:03.500
what it must have been like
to live here two,

19:03.533 --> 19:05.933
three hundred years ago
when you didn't have

19:05.967 --> 19:07.733
the benefits of
some of this machinery.

19:07.767 --> 19:12.400
You didn't have some of these
lightweight, warm clothes.

19:12.433 --> 19:17.233
But, uh, we're pretty spoiled
nowadays living out here,

19:17.267 --> 19:19.667
compared to what people
used to have to put up with.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.267
Feels pretty good already.

19:22.300 --> 19:25.767
The main thing I think
I need to get is these recoils

19:25.800 --> 19:27.300
need to warm up.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.200
Let's see if I can
warm these up
without burning them up.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.733
Fire, man's best friend
up here in the north.

19:40.433 --> 19:43.067
All right, I'm getting
a little bit of heat on these.

19:43.100 --> 19:46.300
I'm gonna try, I think
I'll try this big one first.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.067
It felt like it was pulling
a little bit better.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.533
-(ENGINE WHIRRING)
-Yeah, baby.

19:56.667 --> 19:57.800
All right!

19:59.300 --> 20:00.700
You can't have
high expectations

20:00.733 --> 20:02.933
when it's cold like this.
You just get out, try and get

20:02.967 --> 20:05.100
what you can done,
and be happy with that.

20:14.700 --> 20:17.633
I think that's it.
I can tell it's getting dull.

20:17.667 --> 20:20.433
That's a couple loads of wood
with the dogs.

20:21.733 --> 20:23.233
So that's a good start.

20:27.667 --> 20:30.333
One thing about wood,
it warms you about four times.

20:30.367 --> 20:32.833
Once to cut it,
once to load it,

20:32.867 --> 20:35.400
once to chop it up,
and another time to bring it

20:35.433 --> 20:37.267
in the house
and throw it in the stove.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.667
Still a lot
of work ahead of me.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.567
Once that sun hits that top
of that mountain, temperature

20:41.600 --> 20:44.100
is gonna start dropping quick
and I'm gonna

20:44.133 --> 20:47.733
lose that sunlight.
So, can't slow down,

20:47.767 --> 20:49.367
just gotta keep on humping.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.500
ERIK: We just make it work.
That's the whole thing

20:57.533 --> 21:00.433
about doing anything
out here in the bush.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.867
If you're trapping,
if you're hunting,

21:01.900 --> 21:04.200
just make it work.

21:04.233 --> 21:06.767
This isn't Harvard.
You just have to wanna do it.

21:13.467 --> 21:15.733
Martha and I
set some traps here

21:15.767 --> 21:17.100
just five, six days ago.

21:17.133 --> 21:18.867
We're gonna go down
and check those traps.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.833
There's been some snowfall.

21:20.867 --> 21:22.667
We're gonna tend those traps.

21:23.767 --> 21:25.400
I'm bringing along
a couple more.

21:25.433 --> 21:30.567
Set a few more, if necessary,
and we'll go from there.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.800
We'll see what we got.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.500
Come on, let's roll, honey.

21:35.533 --> 21:38.100
MARTHA: Nature's throwing
a couple of curve balls at us.

21:38.133 --> 21:41.267
We got no snow so we're
walking around on foot.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.700
There's limited light.

21:42.733 --> 21:46.267
So you gotta know
your resources,
and where you are and,

21:46.300 --> 21:48.633
just, uh,
roll with the punches.

21:48.667 --> 21:51.067
Freshen up the bait
here a little bit.

21:53.733 --> 21:56.233
Nothing in that one,
let's check out the next.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.267
Nothing in this one either.

21:59.900 --> 22:03.133
Well, oh for two.

22:03.167 --> 22:05.067
We'll go on, check some more.

22:06.333 --> 22:07.633
Pretty slow day of trapping.

22:07.667 --> 22:10.233
Middle of winter here,
it's, it's just slow.

22:10.267 --> 22:13.633
So, uh, we'll keep trying
and in the end we'll win.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.100
What's going on here?

22:20.067 --> 22:21.500
Oh, it's a marten.

something going on.

-What?
-We caught something.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.467
Something's underneath
the snow there.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.567
Something is either dead
under the snow there...

22:49.600 --> 22:50.800
Got loose.

22:52.467 --> 22:53.567
Oh...

22:56.200 --> 22:58.333
We caught something
and it got away.

23:00.133 --> 23:01.833
Something got caught
in the trap and pulled it out

23:01.867 --> 23:06.333
this way and the trap was
under the snow over there.

23:06.367 --> 23:09.267
Whatever I caught
it didn't hold it very well

23:09.300 --> 23:10.667
and it got loose.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.767
So we'll see what happens here

23:12.800 --> 23:15.333
and I'll reset the trap.

we'll have an animal.

34:47.067 --> 34:48.400
that I have to worry about.

34:51.067 --> 34:55.133
I feel accomplished.
I feel like I, I did
what I set out to do.

34:55.167 --> 34:58.133
It didn't work perfectly,
but, it got me

34:58.167 --> 34:59.467
from point A to point B.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.233
I went through the deep snow
without a problem.

35:02.267 --> 35:05.333
It's getting cold.
It's time to just get my butt

35:05.367 --> 35:07.300
in gear and get back inside.

35:09.767 --> 35:11.700
MARTHA: You just gotta keep
playing in the woods.

35:11.733 --> 35:13.367
That's just part
of living out here.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.333
The cards aren't always
gonna play with you.

35:15.367 --> 35:16.600
They're always
playing against you.

35:30.500 --> 35:34.167
Hopefully that marten decided
to stop back by again.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.633
Yeah, maybe a few more days
of letting those traps soak

35:36.667 --> 35:38.233
and we'll have some fur.

35:38.267 --> 35:39.800
Let's go check it out.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.367
NARRATOR: Erik and
Martha have set traps
to harvest the fur

35:42.400 --> 35:45.333
of Arctic predators,
a priceless source of income

35:45.367 --> 35:46.700
during the winter months.

35:49.633 --> 35:51.433
MARTHA: The traps have been
out for a couple of days.

35:51.467 --> 35:53.067
So hopefully
that marten came back.

35:53.067 --> 35:54.533
It's like a game.
You gotta go back and forth,

35:54.567 --> 35:56.767
back and forth
until you get the animal.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.100
So hopefully he's there.

36:00.067 --> 36:01.233
The temperature
has dropped a lot.

36:01.267 --> 36:02.467
It's well below zero now.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.167
We're hoping this colder
weather gets the animals

36:04.200 --> 36:06.267
moving a little bit.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.767
We also got a new set
that we put out where we saw

36:08.800 --> 36:13.400
a bunch of traffic,
and hopefully that little
spot produced too.

36:18.467 --> 36:21.567
ERIK: What's going down here?
The bait's gone.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.100
The trap has sprung.

36:25.233 --> 36:26.633
ERIK: What is it?

36:26.667 --> 36:27.767
MARTHA: What happened?

36:30.067 --> 36:34.133
Oh, the... He pulled the bait
into the trap.

36:34.700 --> 36:35.933
MARTHA: Oh...

36:35.967 --> 36:37.867
MARTHA: What a
sneaky little...

36:37.900 --> 36:42.767
This is... (CHUCKLES)
Now we got robbed
again by this guy.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.933
ERIK: Oh man.
MARTHA: Let's go check
the other one over here.

36:44.967 --> 36:46.767
ERIK: Let's go
check the next one.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.467
MARTHA: (CHUCKLING) Oh...

36:51.667 --> 36:52.767
MARTHA: Nothing here.

36:54.233 --> 36:56.300
ERIK: Got the bait for sure.

36:59.400 --> 37:00.900
ERIK: It's a weasel
that keeps...

37:00.933 --> 37:02.533
MARTHA: Just sneaking
in the back, huh?

37:04.200 --> 37:06.233
Feed it again there.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.567
ERIK: Totally, uh,
bamboozled us.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.200
Is there anything?

37:15.200 --> 37:18.200
Oh, the weasel fooled
this one too.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.933
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

37:22.967 --> 37:24.533
MARTHA: We're gonna
keep feeding him grouse?

37:24.567 --> 37:25.600
ERIK: We may as well.

37:25.633 --> 37:26.733
Same thing on the menu?

37:26.767 --> 37:28.333
ERIK: Grouse tartar.

37:30.267 --> 37:31.900
ERIK: This is a rather
minor situation.

37:31.933 --> 37:34.767
A weasel has stolen
some of our bait
on several different traps.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.233
So if you reflect on it
like that, a little weasel

37:37.267 --> 37:39.733
doing a little bait damage,
not a big deal.

37:39.767 --> 37:44.400
Oh, well, we re-baited.
Keep on truckin'.
Onto the next.

37:45.433 --> 37:46.733
Weasel's been everywhere.

37:49.233 --> 37:51.067
(MARTHA SPEAKING)

37:51.067 --> 37:53.167
Okay. We've got a lynx.

37:55.867 --> 37:57.133
(GUN FIRE)

38:00.900 --> 38:02.833
It's a really, really
nice animal.

38:02.867 --> 38:03.967
It's as tall as you.

38:04.067 --> 38:05.333
Oh, it's heavy.

38:05.367 --> 38:07.367
-ERIK: That's a
good-looking cat, huh?
-MARTHA: Yeah.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.833
We went to all of our traps

38:09.867 --> 38:11.067
and there was nothing there.

38:11.067 --> 38:12.200
You know, it was kind
of bringing our

38:12.233 --> 38:14.467
energy a little bit down
and our attitude.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.067
And we got to this
last spot here,

38:16.100 --> 38:18.967
and I saw eyes,
and immediately the attitude

38:19.067 --> 38:21.500
went right back up again.

38:21.533 --> 38:24.200
MARTHA: Really cool
to be able to find a
new spot where you see

38:24.233 --> 38:27.167
really good amounts of sign,
set a trap like this,

38:27.200 --> 38:29.433
and in a couple days come back
and have an animal.

38:29.467 --> 38:31.633
I mean,
it's, uh, what we hoped for.

38:34.467 --> 38:36.267
AGNES: You need to be prepared
for everything.

38:36.300 --> 38:37.500
You have to know
what you're doing

38:37.533 --> 38:38.867
when you go out there
and you wanna

38:38.900 --> 38:42.267
just be comfortable
in extreme cold and whatever

38:42.300 --> 38:43.733
Alaska brings you.

38:53.567 --> 38:56.133
CHIP: I'm making
a wall for my tent.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.267
The wind up here
is a big factor all the time.

38:58.300 --> 39:00.467
Staying out of the wind
can help you stay alive.

39:00.500 --> 39:01.900
Takes a day or two to set up.

39:01.933 --> 39:03.467
We actually have to go
get more wood.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.333
I have some firewood
over here.

39:05.367 --> 39:07.067
I gotta get my
chainsaw warmed up.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.433
My wife's gonna make a bed.

39:08.467 --> 39:10.100
Before we can
take off anywhere, we want

39:10.133 --> 39:12.600
to have some place
warm and cosy to return to.

39:15.700 --> 39:18.067
My mundane chore
in this world sometimes seems

39:18.067 --> 39:20.267
to be providing a lot of heat
for my camp,

39:20.300 --> 39:21.767
for my house in Noorvik.

39:21.800 --> 39:25.300
If you ain't warm... (SNIFFS)
You ain't gonna do well.

39:26.367 --> 39:27.700
This right here is what
we cook with,

39:27.733 --> 39:30.467
and this right here
is also what we heat with.

39:30.500 --> 39:33.400
So it's in constant demand.
This log ain't gonna
just sit around,

39:33.433 --> 39:35.700
it's gonna get chopped up,
and it's gonna disappear

39:35.733 --> 39:36.767
up in smoke.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.233
Like to somebody else,
this might be just

39:40.267 --> 39:42.667
a little piece of wood,
but to us, it's a night's

39:42.700 --> 39:44.100
worth of good, solid heat.

39:49.100 --> 39:51.933
How was that ride?
Looks like a pretty good log.

39:51.967 --> 39:53.200
Yeah, I saw it from camp.

39:53.233 --> 39:55.133
Everybody else has
the convenience of hot water

39:55.167 --> 39:57.067
or running water.
Here you don't.

39:57.067 --> 39:59.467
Here, we have running water
under the ice.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.567
(HEAVY BREATHING)

40:01.600 --> 40:04.300
You know, it's... It all works
together in a big circle.

40:04.333 --> 40:07.700
You go get wood to make heat,
to thaw the water,

40:07.733 --> 40:09.033
to cook your dinner.

40:09.067 --> 40:10.433
CHIP: Thirst is the
bane of the arctic.

40:10.467 --> 40:12.333
You start to get cold easy,
and you don't think very well,

40:12.367 --> 40:13.900
and your body
doesn't feel good.

40:13.933 --> 40:16.233
When you're dehydrated,
that's the one thing

40:16.267 --> 40:18.267
you gotta keep doing.
Put in the liquids.

40:18.300 --> 40:20.367
AGNES: I like the clear ice.
I miss the taste of

40:20.400 --> 40:22.233
-Kiwalik River water.
-CHIP: Yeah.

40:22.267 --> 40:24.933
CHIP: You can't just come in,
put up a tent, and
then go off hunting.

40:24.967 --> 40:27.067
Because when you come back,
you'll have to cut the wood,

40:27.100 --> 40:28.467
you'll have to thaw the water,
you'll have to

40:28.500 --> 40:29.900
put in the time,
and that's when

40:29.933 --> 40:31.500
you really wanna sleep.

40:31.533 --> 40:33.833
So I'd rather just
spend the day, go get wood,

40:33.867 --> 40:37.100
go get water, get a good wall
built up around the tent.

40:37.133 --> 40:39.333
The more we can have
prepared now, is less

40:39.367 --> 40:41.000
we have to prepare
when we return from hunting

40:41.033 --> 40:42.800
so we can concentrate
only on hunting.

40:45.867 --> 40:48.800
AGNES: We're glad to be here.
We got our tent up.

40:48.833 --> 40:50.900
Everything's running smooth.

40:50.933 --> 40:52.933
CHIP: Tomorrow we'll figure
out what we're after.

40:52.967 --> 40:54.733
We'll figure out
if there's any animals around.

40:54.767 --> 40:56.433
We'll figure out
where we'll put out traps,

40:56.467 --> 40:58.533
we'll figure out
where the caribou are,
and we'll go from there.

40:58.567 --> 41:00.900
Everywhere around here
is rich in resources.

41:00.933 --> 41:04.067
This entire
Kotzebue Sound area
is resource rich.

41:04.100 --> 41:06.067
And this is just
gonna progress into spring,

41:06.067 --> 41:07.567
and from spring into summer.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.900
And every month
that we're here,
we know what the resources are

41:09.933 --> 41:12.833
and we know
what is harvestable
and what foods

41:12.867 --> 41:15.233
we may be after,
and we know when to be here.

41:15.267 --> 41:19.067
So right now, this is the time
to be here for fur, the time
to be here for caribou.

41:19.100 --> 41:23.133
AGNES: We got out camp
set up. We're ready
to go. It's game on.

41:27.433 --> 41:28.800
ANDY: It's all a big cycle.

41:28.833 --> 41:30.700
It's a real
symbiotic relationship

41:30.733 --> 41:32.067
between me and my dogs.

41:32.067 --> 41:34.067
I depend on them
and they depend on me.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.067
It's the way things should be
in this world.

41:36.067 --> 41:38.100
Everything should
be interconnected.

41:47.967 --> 41:50.067
ANDY: Let's get a fish!

41:50.067 --> 41:51.900
Who wants a fish?
Bergy wants a fish!

41:51.933 --> 41:53.267
Donner, you want a fish?

41:57.700 --> 42:01.133
There's been a long day
cutting wood, getting water,

42:01.167 --> 42:03.433
a lot of struggles
with machinery.

42:03.467 --> 42:05.700
Thank God the only
piece of machinery I got left

42:05.733 --> 42:08.200
to work with, is this.

42:08.233 --> 42:10.700
And this is
my kind of machinery
when it gets cold.

42:12.133 --> 42:15.500
So we'll chop this fish up,
make the dogs happy.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.900
I'll go get some water.
Water them up good.

42:17.933 --> 42:21.067
They really need the,
uh, moisture to rehydrate.

42:21.067 --> 42:25.933
The cold makes it harder
to do the work, but you gotta
do more work when it is cold.

42:25.967 --> 42:28.633
So it's kind of a catch 22.

42:28.667 --> 42:30.233
Here you go, buddy. Yeah!

42:31.867 --> 42:34.567
There's your fish.
Donner always needs
a pat on the head.

42:34.600 --> 42:37.133
Wow. That's
a nice fish, Donner.

42:37.167 --> 42:39.900
Here you go, Carb. Yeah!

42:39.933 --> 42:42.067
Yeah, you did
a good job today.

42:42.100 --> 42:44.533
Eat your fish up. I'm gonna go
get some water for you.

42:52.233 --> 42:53.833
Boy, you did a good job today.

42:53.867 --> 42:55.300
Dogs did all the work today.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.833
Their payback is
to have some nice,

42:57.867 --> 42:59.433
warm water to drink at night.

43:00.833 --> 43:02.200
Is that pretty good, huh?

43:02.233 --> 43:04.200
That's gonna
keep you warm tonight.

43:04.233 --> 43:05.767
Some warm dog food.

43:07.433 --> 43:09.833
Then I get to go inside
to a nice, warm cabin

43:09.867 --> 43:12.833
with all the wood we hauled
and sit down and relax,

43:12.867 --> 43:15.067
get some calories back in me.

43:15.067 --> 43:16.267
Good boys.
