have I let you down?

-That was one time,

05:04.304 --> 05:05.763
and the Rite Aid was out of D.

It's a big city, Tucson. Surprisingly big.
Place like that has a lot of Rite Aids.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.979
-Went to three. None of them had D.
-If it isn't D, why get it at all?

-When sound check is done, I have to go.
-Check with the medical board

05:18.776 --> 05:20.987
-to find out if he's a real doctor?
-Yeah.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.948
It's cool. I'll grab a cab to the hotel.
I'll see you later.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.993
If you swing by Rite Aid,
you should pick up a couple Red Bulls,

05:27.076 --> 05:30.455
and some Band-Aids,
'cause I'm gonna fuck your dick off.

-I don't know. The sad thing is,

in my head for six hours,

she needs a steady hand on her shoulder,

06:19.212 --> 06:20.671
We just have to find her.

Wait. So, you're telling me
that the entire time I'm in Tinseltown,

06:46.989 --> 06:48.950
not only am I not helping Britney,

06:49.033 --> 06:51.786
but there's a chance
I won't even get to meet Katie Holmes

06:51.869 --> 06:53.955
and learn the secrets of her side smile?

You really think you're gonna meet
Katie and Britney wandering the streets?

06:59.418 --> 07:02.338
No.

11:13.547 --> 11:17.134
Whatever. The only way I'm gonna get
through your stupid shack in the woods

11:17.218 --> 11:18.928
is if I'm high as a goddamn kite.

11:19.011 --> 11:23.182
This is moronic, and it's not like you,
and I forbid you to take that acid.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.141
Oh, you forbid me?

11:24.225 --> 11:25.476
I forbid you.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.186
[scoffs] Okay.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.105
[laughs]

11:30.189 --> 11:32.149
-You took the whole thing?
-Yeah.

11:32.733 --> 11:33.567
Call 911.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.903
Whoa, calm down. It's fine.
I'll just spit it out.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.488
Wait. I don't feel it.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.323
-Wait. Do you see it?
-Oh, shit.

11:39.865 --> 11:40.699
I don't see it.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.953
Wait. I got big teeth. Deep pockets.
Look higher up.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.288
No. It's not in there.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.415
Holy fuck.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.667
I was just being dramatic
to prove a point.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.545
-I was gonna spit it out.
-That's not how acid works.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.588
Fuck. Okay...

11:55.297 --> 11:57.383
What do I do?
You wanna tie down all my limbs?

11:57.466 --> 11:59.760
-No. Just quiet. I'm trying to think.
-Okay.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.100
No. What? Why?

12:06.183 --> 12:08.352
You were supposed to babysit me.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.271
Oh. Wait...

12:10.938 --> 12:11.981
Oh... [chuckles]

12:12.565 --> 12:13.941
It was behind my wisdom tooth.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.361
-No, no. It's okay. You spit it out.
-Okay.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.947
-Mm-hmm.
-[coughing]

12:20.030 --> 12:22.116
-Mm-hmm. Yep.
-It's right there. I feel it.

12:24.785 --> 12:25.744
Nope. It's gone.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.163
Okay.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.263
-Bet it's just paper.
-Yeah.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.181
Totally.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.604
This is a bad idea, bad idea, bad idea.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.564
-Stop, stop, stop.
-Bad idea, bad idea...

12:53.647 --> 12:55.316
Stop saying "bad idea."

12:55.399 --> 12:56.609
Idea.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.862
Ooh, do I not know
what the word "idea" is anymore?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.739
We gotta distract ourselves.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.284
-[woman] <i>Come join us at...</i>
-Turn the TV off.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.120
-<i>Where the steaks are world-class...</i>
-The sounds are bright,

13:08.204 --> 13:09.538
and the colors are loud.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.081
Do you hear all those dogs?

13:11.957 --> 13:14.084
This isn't like high school at all.

13:20.799 --> 13:21.634
[Shane] Hey.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.553
Wanna take a shower?

13:25.221 --> 13:27.598
[groans] I'm kind of just waking up.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.102
Come on, it'll be fun.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.855
Never, ever...

13:34.939 --> 13:37.399
pull a soft hotel comforter off a woman.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.780
Hop on my back, I'll take you.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.036
Get on.

13:53.624 --> 13:57.211
I don't care if you're dead,
we're showering together.

13:59.296 --> 14:01.215
That sounded so creepy.

14:09.056 --> 14:12.309
Okay, I know this is fulfilling
some fantasy of yours.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.895
Probably a random summer camp memory.
Not my business.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.689
But I'm cold.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.983
Definitely not getting any cleaner.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.776
I could wash your boobs.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.196
Sure, if you're on your way to my pits.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.244
Yeah.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.164
Mm. Hmm.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.503
All right, let's hit the pool.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.716
We just came from water.
There is more to life than being wet.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.093
You can't stay at a hotel
and not use the pool.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.344
It's like burning money.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.598
Well, unplug the smoke detector,
'cause I'mma light it up.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.224
Okay.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.484
[guitar music playing]

15:02.568 --> 15:04.320
I can feel you moving.

15:05.863 --> 15:06.697

15:08.198 --> 15:09.408
Are you on a boat?

15:31.221 --> 15:32.473
[Annie] Did you just see that?

15:35.309 --> 15:37.645
Is it possible
we're seeing the same thing?

15:39.855 --> 15:42.107
Try switching the space for me.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.588
-[Dax] Do you see it?
-I see...

16:05.047 --> 16:07.800
walls, simple lines...

16:09.510 --> 16:10.511
What is this?

16:11.595 --> 16:14.181
This is Eames.

[Sophia laughs]

-Don't make fun of me.

Only the survivors of the big one
were supposed to see these.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.514
Marco.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.558
Marco.

16:57.641 --> 17:00.144
Your girl made another $400.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.397
Minus shipping, minus service fees,
minus eBay dipping its beak.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.692
No work. Get in,
so we can do that thing

17:06.775 --> 17:10.070
where the girl gets on the guy's shoulders
in the pool for some reason.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.449
Okay, but only if I can get in slow.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.575
Get in fast.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.577
Get in fast. Get in fast.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.245
-Ow, ow, ow!
-Ooh!

17:18.328 --> 17:20.289
[both laughing]

17:20.873 --> 17:21.874
Okay.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.209
Nice.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.253
Oh, goodness.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.881
[shivering]

17:32.426 --> 17:33.594
[Josh] Yo, lover boy.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.971
-Lover boy.
-Yeah?

17:36.764 --> 17:38.849
-I need a cab.
-Okay, just a minute.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.810
-Whoa, is this for real?
-It's cool.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.938
No, I will give you three reasons
why it's not cool, doctor.

17:45.522 --> 17:46.565
One, what?

17:46.648 --> 17:48.734
Two, there are plenty of people
who work here

17:48.817 --> 17:50.861
whose only job is to get cabs,

17:50.944 --> 17:52.946
and three, get it yourself,
Claritin D-bag.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.116
She's a lot.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.621
I know what you're really after.
You're gonna miss me.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.331
You needed a goodbye hug.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.458
Come on.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.544
Tucson is bygones, buddy.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.266
It only took two days to build that frame.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.228
[Annie] How do you know all of this?

18:24.353 --> 18:27.815
Before business school,
I took classes in architectural drafting.

18:27.898 --> 18:31.193
I loved it.
We used these really great pencils.

18:31.985 --> 18:35.072
We'd put them
in these hand-cranked sharpeners.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.117
[whirring]

18:38.826 --> 18:40.994
-It was great.
-I've never used a pencil.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.247
That's not true.

18:44.414 --> 18:47.209
Are you sure you didn't
wanna order any fries from here?

18:47.292 --> 18:49.670
They're so good.
None of that crinkle-cut bullshit.

18:49.753 --> 18:50.796
Nah, I'm not that hungry.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.382
All right, your burger will be out soon.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.051
I'm still checking to see
if we can make a quesadilla.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.846
I mean,
it's just cheese and flat bread, right?

19:01.682 --> 19:04.017
Found this purse the other day,
behind this blanket

19:04.101 --> 19:08.021
that I'm 99 percent sure a man died under,
but the beading on this thing was crazy.

19:08.105 --> 19:11.733
I mean, Bob Mackie meets,
I don't know, Jesus' orgasm.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.611
Old-school Gucci, you know?
So, definitely handmade

19:14.695 --> 19:16.947
-by some badass Italian broads.
-Yeah.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.908
You should see my apartment.
It is completely unrecognizable.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.452
Totally out of control. Fully packed.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.122
Things are just really blowing up for me.

19:40.470 --> 19:41.346
What's wrong?

19:42.347 --> 19:43.599
That burger sitting weird?

19:44.266 --> 19:45.100
Nothing's wrong.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.519
Yes, there is.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.605
So, just say it.

19:50.772 --> 19:51.899
Hey, I went swimming.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.401
In my undies.

19:56.653 --> 19:59.156
Would you stop pretending
to look for something? Shit.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.782
I'm looking for my ChapStick.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.702
Oh, what, was that the first thing
that popped into your head?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.246
Shane.

20:07.247 --> 20:10.334
It was the fries. I like to wait,
so I can eat them with my burger.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.461
-That's what you're pissy about?
-Yeah.

20:12.669 --> 20:13.754
Okay.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.089
Sorry I ate too many fries.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.675
They were my fries.
You said that you didn't want any.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.220
Then you took all of them
because that's what you do.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.597
Dude,
you're gonna have to learn how to share.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.391
You-- You're totally missing the point.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.895
-Which is what?
-Which is that you do whatever you want.

20:29.978 --> 20:32.314
-It's selfish.
-Since when do I do whatever I want?

20:32.397 --> 20:33.732
Are you kidding me? Always.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.400
No one always does anything.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.903
Okay, today at the pool,
that shit you pull in front of Josh?

20:37.986 --> 20:40.239
Oh, you mean Dr. Josh?

20:40.322 --> 20:41.949
-Yeah.
-Dude, that guy is a tool.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.910
I would never let anyone speak to me
the way he speaks to you.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.995
-Yeah, well, I was doing my job.
-Really?

20:47.579 --> 20:49.790
You attacked me
when I was trying to do my job.

20:49.873 --> 20:50.707
I didn't attack--

20:50.791 --> 20:53.001
You attacked me
when I even glanced at my phone.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.420
Don't give me the "doing my job" thing.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.464
Can't you apologize for eating the fries?

20:58.048 --> 21:00.008
-They were just fucking fries!
-Lower your voice.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.553
-Don't tell me what to do.
-Because you do whatever you wanna do.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.974
Oh, I'm bored. Just call me a bitch
and get it over with.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.184
-I'm not gonna do that.
-Fine. I'll do it.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.937
I'm a bitch. I'm the devil.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.856
Mm... You're so perfect.
Sophia, she's a monster.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.525
Don't do that. Grow up.

21:17.192 --> 21:19.611
I am so sick of people telling me
I'm not a grown-up.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.406
I run a fucking business.
What is it that you do?

21:23.615 --> 21:24.825
This is insane.

21:42.217 --> 21:45.470
You get that I dropped everything,
just to come see you this weekend.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.347
Right? Just for you?

21:47.431 --> 21:48.265
Mm-hmm.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.226
For what?
To watch you get an adult man a cab?

21:52.561 --> 21:55.564
I'm a tour manager, Sophia.
I manage people.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.233
Client asked me to get him a cab,
I got him a cab,

21:58.317 --> 22:01.028
ensuring that he'd wanna work
with me again in the future.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.612
It's called professionalism.

22:02.696 --> 22:06.742
Yeah, well, I'd never put up with that.
And maybe that's why I'm doing so great.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.661
You would get so fired from my job,

22:09.745 --> 22:12.289
because it's not
for self-absorbed narcissists.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.751
I would never do your job.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.086
It's a joke.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.964
Fucking glorified errand boy.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.511
Well, thank you for a terrible end
to an otherwise great weekend.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.348
Do whatever the fuck you want
for the rest of the day.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.819
[Annie] I'm feeling a lot
of things right now.

22:44.571 --> 22:45.405
Like what?

22:47.532 --> 22:48.408
Things like...

22:50.285 --> 22:53.455
you're embarrassed of me,
because you think I'm flighty.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.706
You're not flighty.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.541
You're the fireworks.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.085
You're Pop Rocks.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.504
You're birthday cake,
every day of the week.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.005
[chuckles]

23:03.632 --> 23:04.466
Well...

23:06.051 --> 23:08.011
then why haven't I met your parents?

23:09.096 --> 23:11.223
We've been together a whole year,

23:11.306 --> 23:13.141
and they only live 20 minutes away.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.102
I MapQuested it.

23:15.977 --> 23:19.022
-There's a reason.
-Is it because you think I'm dumb?

23:20.315 --> 23:22.150
I still don't understand the difference

23:22.234 --> 23:24.319
between partly sunny and partly cloudy.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.697
Partly cloudy is at night,
when there's no sun.

23:27.781 --> 23:28.740
[chuckles]

23:28.824 --> 23:30.283
And you're not dumb.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.995
It took me a long time
to figure that cloudy thing out, too.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.205
[laughs]

23:36.873 --> 23:38.875
Well, then what is it?

23:42.003 --> 23:42.838
Well...

23:44.339 --> 23:45.382
[sighs]

23:45.465 --> 23:46.383
you're white.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.344
And my parents...

23:49.928 --> 23:52.222
It's gonna be this whole thing.

23:56.309 --> 24:00.355
And you don't wanna deal with it,
'cause you're not sure about me.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.153
You're the only thing that I'm sure of.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.824
I just don't wanna deal with it
because they're crazy.
