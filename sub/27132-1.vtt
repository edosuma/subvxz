02:08.877 --> 02:10.708
<i>one fateful night,</i>

02:11.297 --> 02:14.627

04:35.483 --> 04:36.903
How did it get here?

04:37.652 --> 04:38.702
I don't know.

04:40.989 --> 04:41.989
Is it hurt?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.289
There's no wound.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.248
It's on its own.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.212
[Vihaan] I've never seen a man-cub before.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.296
It's so...

04:58.923 --> 04:59.973
small.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.470
It doesn't fear us.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.099
[baby babbling]

05:05.346 --> 05:07.096
What are we going to do with it?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.114
- [approaching footsteps]
- [wolves growl]

05:11.311 --> 05:12.691
- Evening, Nisha.

Vihaan.

05:13.771 --> 05:14.771
[growls]

05:14.856 --> 05:18.186
- It's a lovely night, isn't it?
- What is it that you want, Tabaqui?

05:18.276 --> 05:20.356
[sniffing] What's that I smell?
Fresh kill?

05:20.445 --> 05:22.315
If it's bones you're after,
look elsewhere.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.986
We have enough mouths to feed.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.084
[cubs bark and whine]

05:27.327 --> 05:30.157
I meant no harm, Nisha. [laughs]

Oh!

05:37.086 --> 05:38.626
[distant roar]

05:39.088 --> 05:40.338
Your master calls.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.050
You best go quickly.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.839
He sounds an ill temper tonight.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.597
That he does. That he does.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.480
And with good reason.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.834
- [Tabaqui screams]
- [wolves growl]

05:53.436 --> 05:56.396
[Tabaqui] I found the man-cub! [laughs]
I found the man-cub!

05:56.481 --> 05:57.771
Finish cleaning him off.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.107
- Nisha.
- Clean him!

05:59.400 --> 06:00.990
- Where you going?
- To Akela.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.113
A council must be held
if we are to keep him.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.677
- [Vihaan] Keep him?
- [Nisha] Don't let him out of your sight.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.121
[Vihaan] We can't keep him!

06:09.577 --> 06:12.707
- [bell ringing]
- [wolves howling]

06:19.295 --> 06:23.255
Nisha, you have called council.
What's the matter at hand?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.303
We've found... a man-cub.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.721
[wolves chattering]

06:33.351 --> 06:37.231
- [male 1] That's not a wolf.
- [female] That doesn't belong here. [male 2] A man-cub! Outrageous.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.017
Well,

06:40.108 --> 06:41.728
this is most unusual indeed.

06:42.902 --> 06:43.902
Nisha,

06:44.070 --> 06:46.490
you wish to raise this cub
as if he were your own?

06:47.281 --> 06:48.531
- I do.
- [wolves whine]

06:49.158 --> 06:50.158
And Vihaan? You, too?

06:53.204 --> 06:54.044
I do.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.292
[male] It's a man-cub!

06:55.540 --> 06:56.540
You know the law.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.169
This cub was not born among us.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.297
So, who,<i> here,</i> speaks for the cub?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.465
[Bagheera pants] I speak for the cub.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.347
The law states that the life of a cub...

07:12.849 --> 07:14.019
may be bought...

07:14.475 --> 07:15.475
for a price.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.193
I brought my payment.

07:18.771 --> 07:19.771
We have one.

07:20.356 --> 07:21.186
[barking]

07:21.274 --> 07:23.114
Who else will speak for the cub?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.277
Baloo does.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.818
[male wolf] Baloo?

07:27.196 --> 07:30.026
- Bagheera...
- He's not a wolf. He has no say.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.756
He's the teacher of your cubs.
That makes him a member of the pack.

07:33.661 --> 07:36.541
I ain't speakin' for no... [snickers]

07:36.873 --> 07:37.963
...a man-cub.

07:38.916 --> 07:42.586
Bagheera, have you lost your mind?
A man-cub living in the jungle?

07:48.926 --> 07:50.926
[sniffs]

07:58.603 --> 07:59.603
[Nisha] Akela,

07:59.687 --> 08:01.437
his parents will come.

08:01.522 --> 08:02.822
[loud roaring]

08:03.024 --> 08:07.284
[Shere Khan] His parents are dead.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.026
I killed them.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.414
[Tabaqui laughs]

08:11.532 --> 08:15.412
There is no one to come looking for him.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.408
[wolves growl]

08:17.538 --> 08:19.748
This is not your concern, Shere Khan.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.382
The cub is mine.

08:21.459 --> 08:24.209
I already tasted its mother's blood.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.795
It is my right.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.972
Your right according to who's law?

08:30.051 --> 08:31.261
Best you leave now.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.974
Careful, Akela.

08:35.431 --> 08:38.181
You do not want to challenge me.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.937
[Tabaqui laughs]

08:40.061 --> 08:41.061
This cub...

08:42.104 --> 08:44.234
is under the protection of the pack.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.187
Should you decide to take me,

08:47.818 --> 08:50.068
you take on the pack.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.239
All of us.

08:52.323 --> 08:55.033
[wolves snarl and bark]

08:56.410 --> 08:57.580
As long as I am leader,

08:58.287 --> 09:00.917
this part of the jungle is closed to you.

09:00.998 --> 09:03.998
- [snarling and barking]
- [Baloo and Bagheera roar]

09:04.335 --> 09:07.955
You cannot be leader forever.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.718
The day you miss your kill,

09:11.634 --> 09:14.514
the man-cub's blood...

09:14.845 --> 09:18.805
will run down my chin.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.225
[wolves growl]

09:30.653 --> 09:32.363
[Akela] The cub is spoken for.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.068
He is one of us.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.664
You will teach him as you would your own.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.907
As long as I am alive,

09:39.662 --> 09:41.712
the pack will stand by the man-cub.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.164
[Akela howls]

09:43.207 --> 09:45.917
[all howl]

09:48.254 --> 09:50.264
[kite screams] [cows mooing]

10:11.569 --> 10:13.569
[bells jingle]
[indistinct human chattering]

10:26.917 --> 10:28.917
[Mowgli laughing]

10:29.003 --> 10:30.003
Whoa!

10:31.964 --> 10:33.974
[leaves rustle]

10:34.717 --> 10:38.047
[Mowgli whooping and laughing]

10:51.442 --> 10:54.862
[Bagheera]
Hunting is sacred, little brother.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.740
It is our right.

10:59.408 --> 11:02.908
But we never do it for sport.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.498
Shh...

11:09.877 --> 11:11.587
[snarling]

11:19.970 --> 11:22.430
[panting] Wait. Wait.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.440
We look them in the eye...

11:27.603 --> 11:28.943
so that the soul...

11:29.355 --> 11:31.265
doesn't depart, alone.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.568
[birds chittering]

12:07.810 --> 12:08.980
[softly] Bagheera...

12:09.937 --> 12:12.257
- [Bagheera grunts softly]
- [crunching insect] [birds caw]

12:19.864 --> 12:21.744
How old is the jungle, Bagheera?

12:22.491 --> 12:25.411
The jungle has been here
since before you were born

12:25.494 --> 12:27.294
and it will be here...

12:29.206 --> 12:30.366
[yawning]

12:30.499 --> 12:31.999
...after you die.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.841
The jungle is eternal.

12:35.629 --> 12:36.799
[Mowgli] Bagheera...

12:38.507 --> 12:42.427
why am I different to the other wolves?

12:50.478 --> 12:51.768
You are no different,

12:52.605 --> 12:53.645
little brother.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.436
You are special.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.862
[Baloo] <i>Of course you're different.</i>
[sniffs]

13:01.280 --> 13:03.280
That's why you need special training.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.623
You know what your trouble is?

13:06.452 --> 13:07.452
Lack of focus.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.120
[Mowgli] Baloo,

13:09.413 --> 13:11.463
how many ants can you fit in your mouth?

13:11.957 --> 13:13.377
Ants are really small

13:13.834 --> 13:15.844
and your mouth is really big.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.424
- I bet...
- Mowgli, will you concentrate?

13:24.595 --> 13:26.255
[scorpion hissing and snapping]

13:26.430 --> 13:27.430
Do... not...

13:30.476 --> 13:31.476
move.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.863
Why do I have to do this?

13:38.943 --> 13:39.943
'Cause I said so.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.695
Tell me the three laws, now.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.569
"No wolf shall have contact with man."

13:43.656 --> 13:45.116
- Next.
- Baloo...

13:46.158 --> 13:48.328
- what happened to your tail?
- Next!

13:48.577 --> 13:50.657
"No wolf shall hunt man's animals.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.998
Above all, the cow, which is sacred!"

13:54.416 --> 13:57.546
Did it fall off?
Is that why you don't have one?

13:57.628 --> 13:59.548
What? Why haven't you got a tail?

13:59.630 --> 14:02.260
I don't know.
I never really thought about it.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.511
Third law.

14:03.801 --> 14:04.641
Now!

14:04.718 --> 14:08.258
"No wolf shall kill man in the jungle,
for killing man only brings danger."

14:08.347 --> 14:10.347
Oh, well. Least you know your laws.

14:10.432 --> 14:13.522
Now, we just got to get you
to run as fast as the other wolves.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.364
- [Baloo chuckles] Oy!
- [Mowgli grunts and groans]

14:18.566 --> 14:21.486
Don't let your guard down. [laughs]

14:22.111 --> 14:24.201
All right,
that's enough for today, Mowgli.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.320
[Mowgli howling]

14:25.406 --> 14:29.196
Straight back to the caves.
No wandering. Run like a wolf, d'you hear?

14:29.660 --> 14:32.120
[Mowgli] I can't hear you!

14:32.204 --> 14:35.124
[Baloo chuckles and sighs]

14:46.552 --> 14:48.552
[sniffs] [birds tweeting]

14:59.315 --> 15:02.065
[cows mooing]

15:02.359 --> 15:04.359
[bells jingling] [indistinct chattering]

15:11.952 --> 15:13.002
[Bhoot] Mowgli!

15:13.829 --> 15:14.909
Hey, Mowgli. [pants]

15:15.706 --> 15:17.626
- Bhoot!
- What are you doing?

15:17.833 --> 15:20.093
- Nothing.
- Hey, do you want to play?

15:21.629 --> 15:23.709
- [Mowgli] Got ya!
- [Bhoot screams] - [laughs] - Oh!

15:26.133 --> 15:28.053
Oh, I nearly had you.

15:29.845 --> 15:30.965
You're good at hiding.

15:31.055 --> 15:34.765
Mum taught me how to hide.
She shows me loads of tricks.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.770
[laughs] So I can protect myself.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.523
She says, "Others can mistake...

15:40.731 --> 15:42.821
individuality for weakness."

15:43.192 --> 15:45.492
That's why they have a go at me sometimes.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.112
Yeah.

15:48.697 --> 15:49.697
Me, too.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.992
Come on. I'll race you home.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.120
- [Bhoot chuckles]
- On my call...

15:56.163 --> 15:57.163
Go!

15:59.166 --> 16:00.876
[Mowgli howls]

16:01.043 --> 16:03.383
[both laughing]

16:07.841 --> 16:09.841
[howling]

16:11.303 --> 16:12.303
Hey.

16:13.681 --> 16:14.681
Hey, brother.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.641
What did Baloo make you do today?

16:17.726 --> 16:19.806
Put a scorpion on me
and told me not to move.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.935
- [laughs]
- [Mowgli] He says I lack focus.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.152
[brother]
Aw, Baloo says that to all of us.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.817
- How was your lesson?
- Fine.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.706
Your brother tells me
you're getting faster.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.699
He can nearly keep pace with me.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.241
He can almost beat Bhoot. [laughs]

16:32.324 --> 16:35.204
Yeah, he should just race
with his freak friend!

16:35.285 --> 16:37.745
It's only natural they spend
so much time with each other.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.370
Freaks have to stick together.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.456
- [wolves growl]
- [Bhoot gasps and grunts]

16:43.002 --> 16:44.002
[Nisha] That's enough.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.795
Ow. That really hurt.

16:45.879 --> 16:46.799
Inside, now.

16:46.880 --> 16:47.880
[wolves whine]

16:47.965 --> 16:48.965
Thanks.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.641
You shouldn't let them pick on you
like that.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.796
We were only playing.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.143
Better go home, Bhoot.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.176
Bye, Mowgli! [chuckles] Ow.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.016
I meant what I said to Mum.
You are getting faster.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.902
Your father was never
much of a runner either.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.769
It's true. I was the slowest in my group.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.896
I never thought I was gonna complete
The Running. I was sure I would fail.

17:08.609 --> 17:11.609
- You're going to be late.
- Have a good hunt, Father.

17:11.696 --> 17:15.027
Before you know it, you'll be coming along
with me. All of you!

17:16.868 --> 17:19.659
- [male wolf] Good hunting!
- [Vihaan] Good hunting all!

17:19.747 --> 17:21.747
[howling]

17:30.090 --> 17:31.590
[Baloo] This is the jungle!

17:32.801 --> 17:35.261
In the jungle, we all hunt.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.675
And... [snarls]

17:36.764 --> 17:39.394
...we are all hunted.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.023
You see what that means.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.230
It means that you...

17:43.771 --> 17:45.311
you don't want to get caught.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.397
[wolves growl and bark]

17:47.733 --> 17:50.693
That's why you can't join the pack...

17:51.278 --> 17:54.528
until you have passed The Running...
[shouts] Pay attention!

17:54.615 --> 17:56.615
[whines]

18:01.163 --> 18:02.623
"What's The Running, Baloo?"

18:03.874 --> 18:06.924
The running is the hunt where you...

18:07.628 --> 18:09.208
are the prey.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.421
[wolves and Mowgli whine]

18:11.924 --> 18:13.054
Now, Bagheera here...

18:13.133 --> 18:14.933
You all know Bagheera, don't you?

18:15.010 --> 18:16.720
Yeah, Bagheera, friendly Bagheera.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.429
In The Running, Bagheera will hunt you,

18:20.516 --> 18:21.926
and if he catches you...

18:22.643 --> 18:23.733
you fail.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.003
What happens if you fail?
[yelling] You don't join the pack!

18:28.690 --> 18:30.690
- [wolves whine]
- [Mowgli whimpers]

18:33.987 --> 18:36.367
But I've never had one of my cubs fail.

18:36.698 --> 18:37.698
[sniffs]

18:39.034 --> 18:42.204
And I'm not gonna start now. [laughs]

18:43.163 --> 18:44.923
[Mowgli gasps]

18:44.998 --> 18:45.998
Good.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.708
Let's practice, shall we?

18:52.673 --> 18:53.673
[Baloo] On my call.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.473
Wait... wait...

18:59.263 --> 19:00.263
Go!

19:01.557 --> 19:02.807
[Baloo] Come on, now!

19:04.893 --> 19:06.023
Pick up the pace!

19:09.857 --> 19:11.277
Come on!

19:13.485 --> 19:14.485
Faster!

19:15.487 --> 19:17.487
[Mowgli panting]

19:24.913 --> 19:27.333
[Baloo breathing heavily]

19:36.758 --> 19:38.758
[monkey chittering]

19:48.645 --> 19:51.435
[monkey chatters]

20:12.711 --> 20:13.711
[grunts]

20:13.754 --> 20:15.714
You were with the monkey-people...

20:16.089 --> 20:19.009
again. [breathes heavily]

20:19.218 --> 20:20.218
[laughs]

20:20.302 --> 20:22.552
[Baloo] The monkey-people have no law,

20:23.347 --> 20:24.597
they're unpredictable,

20:24.681 --> 20:26.481
and they can't even speak proper.

20:26.892 --> 20:30.562
- [Mowgli] I think they're funny.
- [Baloo] There's nothing funny about them.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.306
You keep away, do you understand?

20:32.397 --> 20:36.187
- I'm not afraid of them.
- Only fools feel no fear, Mowgli.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.030
[Baloo]
The monkey-people are especially foolish.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.989
There's nothing they're afraid of.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.275
Well, except Kaa. [laughs]

20:44.618 --> 20:46.698
Oh, they can't even lay eyes on her.

20:46.787 --> 20:47.787
[Mowgli] Who's Kaa?

20:47.871 --> 20:50.871
- Oh, you don't want to meet Kaa.
- [Mowgli chuckles]

20:51.083 --> 20:53.133
Kaa the Python...

20:53.210 --> 20:55.250
is as old as the jungle.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.757
She sees the past...

20:59.424 --> 21:00.764
and the future.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.842
[flies buzzing]

21:03.303 --> 21:05.853
- [Mowgli pants]
- [shouts] Turn around!

21:09.977 --> 21:10.977
Eyes forward.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.019
[flies buzzing]

21:17.776 --> 21:18.776
The cow...

21:18.944 --> 21:21.284
had been killed
and left there to be found.

21:21.738 --> 21:27.578
- [male 1] The tiger! He's come back!
- Only Khan would kill man's cattle.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.501
- [male 2] One man-cub will bring more men!
- It's Shere Khan!

21:30.580 --> 21:32.920
Akela, we knew this would happen!
We told you!

21:33.000 --> 21:36.340
Can't you see, Akela,
the man-cub is putting us all in danger.

21:36.420 --> 21:40.590
- You were wrong to ever take him in!
- We should give him to the tiger!

21:40.674 --> 21:42.594
- Akela, no!
- [male wolf] Save the pack!

21:43.051 --> 21:44.051
Please.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.064
He is one of us.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.769
I will see to this matter.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.561
Go!

21:54.187 --> 21:56.187
[howling]

22:05.073 --> 22:07.583
Shere Khan wants to bring war
to the jungle.

22:08.702 --> 22:09.702
War?

22:10.662 --> 22:12.962
With man? Is he out of his mind?

22:13.040 --> 22:14.040
War with me.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.289
He knows I'm getting old.

22:17.919 --> 22:20.339
This is his way of bringing chaos
to the pack.

22:21.214 --> 22:24.014
- Khan wants the boy.
- We can protect him.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.972
You know there is only one way
to protect him.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.432
He must go to the man village.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.477
You're forgetting, Bagheera,

22:32.017 --> 22:34.727
this was always more
than just a good deed.

22:35.479 --> 22:36.939
The jungle is changing.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.443
Man is taking more of it,
as each season passes.

22:42.736 --> 22:43.736
And the boy...

22:44.446 --> 22:47.696
may just be our only hope of survival.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.872
The jungle is no longer safe for him.

22:51.828 --> 22:55.168
- The pack won't accept him.
- They will if he passes The Running.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.134
Baloo, is he ready?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.629
Of course he's not ready.
He's not a wolf.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.001
Then make him ready.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.933
[Baloo sighs]

23:06.968 --> 23:08.008
[Baloo] Right,

23:08.095 --> 23:09.385
no more messing about.

23:10.305 --> 23:11.965
Can you run as fast as a wolf?

23:12.641 --> 23:13.731
No, you can't.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.518
You've got hands with fingers on the ends,

23:17.604 --> 23:18.614
so let's use them.

23:18.688 --> 23:19.688
What?

23:20.315 --> 23:22.395
Now jump, to there.

23:23.318 --> 23:24.438
Come on, hurry up.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.239
[Mowgli pants]

23:27.656 --> 23:29.406
[grunts, thuds]

23:29.950 --> 23:30.950
[Baloo laughs]

23:31.034 --> 23:32.454
[birds fluttering and chirping]

23:32.536 --> 23:33.536
Again.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.372
[grunts, thuds]

23:35.580 --> 23:36.920
[Baloo] Oh, nearly!

23:41.044 --> 23:42.044
[grunting]

23:42.921 --> 23:45.421
Ah! [yelling]

23:45.507 --> 23:46.797
- Yes!
- Baloo!

23:46.883 --> 23:48.893
[laughing]

23:49.886 --> 23:51.006
[Mowgli grunts, thuds]

23:52.097 --> 23:53.097
[groans]

23:55.851 --> 23:57.601
[birds cawing]

24:14.077 --> 24:16.077
[growl echoing through water]

24:41.938 --> 24:43.268
[bubbling]

24:47.569 --> 24:49.569
[Shere Khan sighs]

24:53.325 --> 24:55.485
[moaning]

24:58.371 --> 25:00.871
[Shere Khan growls]

25:12.093 --> 25:13.473
[shouts] Ah!

25:17.015 --> 25:18.725
[roaring]

25:23.897 --> 25:25.517
[panting]

25:26.399 --> 25:27.399
Ah!

25:28.193 --> 25:30.453
[grunting]

25:32.239 --> 25:33.739
[yells]

25:34.199 --> 25:36.409
[birds calling and fluttering]

25:36.493 --> 25:38.503
[growls]

25:38.954 --> 25:40.254
[gasps]

25:43.833 --> 25:46.553
[distant roaring]

25:53.009 --> 25:55.259
[approaching footsteps]

25:56.263 --> 25:58.273
[growling]

26:09.317 --> 26:11.397
[loud pounding]

26:14.781 --> 26:17.031
[Mowgli breathing heavily]

26:48.273 --> 26:50.283
[soft trumpeting]

26:56.114 --> 26:58.034
[Bagheera snarls]

26:58.116 --> 26:59.116
What happened?

27:02.537 --> 27:05.167
[Bagheera panting]

27:10.295 --> 27:12.295
[trumpeting] [birds tweeting]

27:24.768 --> 27:26.098
Come on, little brother.

27:26.645 --> 27:27.645
Time to go home.

27:33.276 --> 27:35.276
[growls softly] [indistinct human chatter]

27:51.086 --> 27:53.126
[Bagheera]
Do you know why those men have come?

27:53.213 --> 27:55.223
[bells dinging]

27:56.424 --> 27:59.764
[Bagheera] They've come to hunt the tiger
that steals their cattle.

28:00.136 --> 28:01.216
Will they kill him?

28:01.304 --> 28:02.304
It won't be easy.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.022
Shere Khan...

28:05.517 --> 28:06.517
is clever.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.191
Very dangerous.

28:12.774 --> 28:13.774
Mowgli...

28:15.318 --> 28:17.198
the jungle is no longer safe for you.

28:19.114 --> 28:23.084
But if you were to be in a place
where Shere Khan would never go,

28:23.827 --> 28:25.197
then you would be safe.

28:26.329 --> 28:27.959
Where does Shere Khan never go?

28:29.124 --> 28:30.254
Mmm...

28:30.417 --> 28:32.667
you know... the man village.

28:33.169 --> 28:34.499
Why would I go there?

28:39.676 --> 28:41.586
Because you are a man-cub.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.024
I have seen the way
you look at the village.

28:47.308 --> 28:48.688
[Mowgli whimpers]

28:48.810 --> 28:50.560
You are one of them.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.111
I'm a wolf.

28:53.189 --> 28:54.229
Mowgli...

28:54.649 --> 28:56.739
[Bagheera sighs]

28:59.404 --> 29:01.744
He wants your blood, little brother.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.910
It was Shere Khan
who killed your man-parents

29:04.993 --> 29:06.663
all those seasons ago,

29:07.287 --> 29:09.707
and now he wants to kill you.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.666
The pack will protect me.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.291
If you fail The Running...

29:14.377 --> 29:15.247
I won't fail.

29:15.336 --> 29:16.336
You won't...

29:17.213 --> 29:18.673
be able to join the pack.

29:19.048 --> 29:20.628
[shouts] I won't fail!

29:22.385 --> 29:23.755
Then promise me this.

29:25.472 --> 29:26.722
If you do fail...

29:28.016 --> 29:29.426
you will go to the village.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.185
Promise me, Mowgli.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.907
[Mowgli pants] [indistinct human chatter]

29:57.545 --> 29:59.755
- [woman groans]
- [man] Good evening!

29:59.923 --> 30:01.933
[laughter] [men speaking Hindi]

30:16.689 --> 30:18.689
[fire crackling]

30:23.029 --> 30:25.409
[Lockwood] Don't worry.
I'll kill your tiger.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.123
How many's he taken this time?

30:28.201 --> 30:29.201
Careful!

30:29.536 --> 30:30.746
Quickly, now. Come on.

30:30.954 --> 30:34.464
- [Tabaqui pants]
- [flies buzzing]

30:40.129 --> 30:41.589
[Tabaqui laughs]

30:45.802 --> 30:47.182
[whining]

30:47.554 --> 30:51.064
[exclaiming]

30:58.231 --> 30:59.151
[sizzling]

30:59.232 --> 31:00.482
[sighs]

31:08.783 --> 31:10.333
[snarls]

31:10.702 --> 31:12.872
Did you smell the blood, man-cub?

31:14.163 --> 31:15.293
[whispers] What is it?

31:19.168 --> 31:23.088
- The creature that did that to your tail.
- [Tabaqui] It's called "fire."

31:24.007 --> 31:25.627
It's hotter than the sun.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.758
And it's quicker than the panther.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.222
Your kind use dark magic, man-cub.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.848
They're not my kind.

31:34.934 --> 31:36.944
[laughs]

31:41.524 --> 31:42.524
Sometimes...

31:43.484 --> 31:46.284
I dream I'm a tiger. [growls]

31:47.113 --> 31:49.163
But I always wake up a hyena.

31:52.911 --> 31:53.911
[laughs]

31:53.953 --> 31:56.583
[groans] Ow.

31:58.917 --> 31:59.917
Ooh.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.418
[birds tweeting] [elephant trumpets]

32:12.388 --> 32:14.388
You should try and get some sleep.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.649
You'll want to be rested for tomorrow.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.991
What's bothering you, my love?

32:34.827 --> 32:36.537
All I've ever wanted...

32:38.957 --> 32:40.377
my whole life...

32:42.377 --> 32:43.707
is to be a wolf.

32:47.882 --> 32:50.182
For the others to see me as an...

32:52.345 --> 32:53.345
equal.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.944
This is my chance to prove myself.

33:00.269 --> 33:02.109
To prove that I'm one of them.

33:04.023 --> 33:05.403
To prove that I belong.

33:05.483 --> 33:06.483
You belong.

33:10.363 --> 33:11.863
You belong, Mowgli.

33:14.492 --> 33:17.792
Don't, ever, let anyone
make you think otherwise.

33:21.207 --> 33:23.667
You will always be my son, Mowgli.

33:26.212 --> 33:28.132
Nothing can ever change that.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.083
[Akela] You are about to take part

34:01.289 --> 34:03.249
in one of our oldest traditions.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.502
The Running of the Pack.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.458
Those of you who pass the test...

34:10.965 --> 34:12.335
will have earned the right...

34:13.301 --> 34:14.301
to join us...

34:14.844 --> 34:15.934
in the night hunt.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.677
As is customary...

34:22.060 --> 34:24.600
Bagheera will perform his task as chaser.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.687
[heart beating]

34:27.940 --> 34:29.030
Mowgli!

34:29.609 --> 34:30.989
Good luck, Mowgli!

34:34.112 --> 34:36.123
[wolves growl and whine]

34:41.204 --> 34:42.333
Face the hill.

34:48.710 --> 34:49.801
Good luck, brother.

34:49.879 --> 34:54.179
[Akela] I must warn you.
Bagheera has been told not to hold back.

34:54.257 --> 34:56.257
[growls]

34:57.595 --> 34:59.215
[panting]

34:59.972 --> 35:00.972
[Akela] On my call.

35:06.938 --> 35:07.978
Go!

35:10.858 --> 35:11.938
[yelping]

35:12.610 --> 35:13.610
[groans] [grunts]

35:19.826 --> 35:20.826
Bagheera.

35:21.619 --> 35:22.499
If you will.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.830
[Bagheera roars]

38:04.991 --> 38:06.411
[Baloo] Let him go, Bagheera.

38:08.577 --> 38:09.407
Bagheera...

38:09.495 --> 38:10.785
[roars]

38:15.876 --> 38:17.416
[Mowgli pants]

38:24.719 --> 38:26.719
[snorts]

38:32.476 --> 38:33.476
Get up.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.768
[whimpering]

38:54.749 --> 38:56.709
You let your guard down.

38:58.419 --> 39:01.879
I told you, never let your guard down.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.384
He was only chasing <i>me.</i>

39:03.466 --> 39:04.836
He targeted <i> me.</i>

39:04.925 --> 39:06.385
He knows I'm the weakest.

39:07.511 --> 39:09.261
[sighs]

39:11.182 --> 39:13.062
[Mowgli whimpers]

39:13.434 --> 39:14.984
All of your lessons...

39:15.770 --> 39:17.270
[shouts] ...they mean nothing!

39:21.400 --> 39:22.400
[Bagheera] Mowgli!

39:22.485 --> 39:24.145
Bagheera! He's fine.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.029
Let him be.

39:26.447 --> 39:27.777
[wolf] See ya, freak!

39:30.076 --> 39:32.076

Hey, Mowgli.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.796
[Bhoot chuckling] Oh!

40:32.138 --> 40:33.138
Ha!

- [Mowgli gasps] Ah!
- [Bhoot shrieks]

40:35.474 --> 40:37.354
[Mowgli yelling]

40:39.228 --> 40:41.268
I saw that look in your eye

40:41.355 --> 40:43.105
when you were standing over him.

40:43.190 --> 40:45.730
I did what I did because I had to.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.448
Do you think I am stupid?

40:47.528 --> 40:49.908
[shouts] I saw what you did!

40:49.989 --> 40:51.909
[both roaring]

40:52.032 --> 40:55.662
[Mowgli yelling] Help! Help! Help!

40:55.786 --> 40:57.286
He was in the lead!

40:57.580 --> 40:59.330
I trained that boy!

40:59.415 --> 41:01.245
Why did you have to do that?

41:01.333 --> 41:03.753
- [Bagheera] He had to fail!
- [yells]

41:03.836 --> 41:07.086
[Bagheera]
Why can't you see how much danger he's in?

41:07.173 --> 41:10.013
[Baloo] The pack would have protected him!

41:11.051 --> 41:16.311
Khan will kill him
and tear the pack apart.

41:17.266 --> 41:19.596
You are not the only one

41:19.685 --> 41:21.595
who cares about the boy.

41:21.687 --> 41:24.517
All you care about is that he passed.

41:24.607 --> 41:28.317
That is because it's my job!

41:28.402 --> 41:31.112
[Bhoot whines]
Bagheera! Baloo! Up here!

41:31.197 --> 41:33.237
Mowgli's been taken by the monkey-people!

42:04.813 --> 42:06.073
[Mowgli grunts] Let go!

42:08.484 --> 42:09.494
Let me go!

42:13.614 --> 42:17.624
[Mowgli grunting and screaming]

[growling]

43:59.970 --> 44:02.720
My, my.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.690
How you've grown.

44:08.312 --> 44:09.362
[monkey yelps]

44:10.981 --> 44:14.611
And how much chaos
you brought upon the pack.

44:16.528 --> 44:20.868
So much more...

44:22.201 --> 44:23.581
to come.

44:23.952 --> 44:26.042
[growls]

44:34.171 --> 44:35.171
Just...

44:36.382 --> 44:38.682
a little taste.

45:56.879 --> 46:00.339
Let the man-cub alone.

46:00.799 --> 46:02.049
He belongs...

46:02.342 --> 46:04.182
to us. [hisses]

[water flowing]

46:47.429 --> 46:48.429
Kaa...

46:52.226 --> 46:53.806
She saved me.

47:00.776 --> 47:01.776
Why?

47:13.705 --> 47:16.035
[wolves howling]

47:23.841 --> 47:24.971
[Akela] Good hunting!

47:35.394 --> 47:36.484
[Bhoot] Mowgli!

Hey, Mowgli.

47:38.313 --> 47:40.733
- [cracks]
- [Bhoot gasps and laughs]

47:44.278 --> 47:45.278
Don't worry.

47:45.737 --> 47:47.487
We'll get to join them soon enough.

47:47.739 --> 47:48.909
I just know it.

47:49.241 --> 47:53.701
Mum says, some wolves just need more time.
It doesn't mean we're not good enough.

47:54.079 --> 47:56.579
Hey, why don't we have our own night hunt?

47:56.957 --> 47:59.127
Just you and me.
What do you say?

48:00.878 --> 48:01.878
[Mowgli sighs]

48:03.547 --> 48:05.007
[sighs]

48:05.173 --> 48:08.263
You've been spending a lot of time
on your own since the monkey-people.

48:08.510 --> 48:09.890
It's not good to be alone.

48:09.970 --> 48:11.690
Wolves are supposed to be
with other wolves.

48:11.722 --> 48:12.722
I'm not a wolf.

48:13.765 --> 48:15.925
[laughs]

48:17.519 --> 48:19.349
Of course you are, Mowgli.

48:19.438 --> 48:20.898
You're the best wolf I know!

48:21.607 --> 48:23.977
Why do you always want to be
around me, Bhoot?

48:24.359 --> 48:26.239
'Cause you're my best friend, Mowgli.

48:29.698 --> 48:31.158
[Mowgli sighs]

48:34.077 --> 48:35.077
[snorts]

48:36.038 --> 48:37.498
I understand what it's like.

48:39.082 --> 48:40.252
For nobody to want you.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.173
I don't have any friends neither.

48:47.382 --> 48:48.222
But...

48:48.300 --> 48:49.340
we have each other.

48:50.052 --> 48:51.852
And we're kind of same, you and me.

48:51.929 --> 48:53.059
We're not the same.

48:53.138 --> 48:54.308
Of course we are.

48:54.389 --> 48:56.559
Because you're special and I'm special.

48:56.642 --> 48:58.482
[shouts] We're not special!

48:59.227 --> 49:00.307
Don't you get it?

49:01.063 --> 49:03.573
We'll never be one of them!
We're freaks!

49:04.274 --> 49:06.494
You're not special, Bhoot!

49:07.110 --> 49:10.860
It's just something your mother tells you
to make you feel better about yourself...

49:10.948 --> 49:13.488
because you came out wrong!

49:15.035 --> 49:17.035
[whimpers]

49:31.426 --> 49:32.426
Bhoot...

49:33.679 --> 49:34.849
Bhoot, I'm sorry.

50:04.710 --> 50:06.710
[leaves rustling]

[Akela yells]

50:32.237 --> 50:33.527
[wolves panting]

50:38.994 --> 50:39.994
Kaa?

50:44.916 --> 50:45.916
Kaa.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.000
Well,

50:48.754 --> 50:50.634
look who's here.

50:52.716 --> 50:54.086
It's the man-cub,

50:54.593 --> 50:58.063
his destiny still uncertain.

50:59.264 --> 51:02.314
Are you afraid of me, man-cub?

51:04.311 --> 51:05.311
No.

51:07.022 --> 51:09.072
Sometimes fear...

51:09.983 --> 51:12.743
is the only intelligent response.

51:16.364 --> 51:17.364
Don't you think?

51:17.449 --> 51:19.449
[breathes shakily]

51:23.872 --> 51:25.712
Say something...

51:28.710 --> 51:30.460
or I shall get bored.

51:33.673 --> 51:35.883
And when I get bored...

51:37.052 --> 51:38.642
I get hungry.

51:41.056 --> 51:42.056
Is it...

51:43.100 --> 51:46.850
Is it true that you know the past
and the future?

51:47.521 --> 51:50.071
What is it you want from me...

51:50.732 --> 51:51.572
man-cub?

51:51.650 --> 51:54.030
Why did you save me
from the monkey-people?

51:54.778 --> 51:58.818
Why do you think
the elephant saved you from the tiger pit?

52:00.200 --> 52:05.040
The whole jungle has been watching you,
man-cub.
