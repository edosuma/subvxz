WEBVTT

00:02.498 --> 00:04.530
Here you go, up there,
first hook.

00:05.538 --> 00:06.542
That's it.

00:19.458 --> 00:22.486
You know where that Madge
rests at night, don't you?

00:24.454 --> 00:26.480
She folds her wings,

00:26.482 --> 00:29.468
and she hangs upside down
in a church belfry.

00:29.470 --> 00:30.540
She's always all right with me.

00:30.542 --> 00:33.524
Oh, yeah. Just you be careful.

00:33.526 --> 00:37.456
I'm sure I saw her
in this horror movie

00:37.458 --> 00:39.510
where she was eating
this grocer's lad.

00:41.462 --> 00:43.468
Not with a knife and fork.

00:43.470 --> 00:45.498
But with her claws.

00:47.534 --> 00:49.516
Oh, good day to you, ladies.

00:49.518 --> 00:51.468
Hello, Granville.

00:51.470 --> 00:53.464
Don't be making eyes at him.

00:53.466 --> 00:54.534
It was just the one eye.

00:56.522 --> 01:01.482
Watch the back,
Madge can frown with the back.

01:47.462 --> 01:49.492
Hey, who does that remind you of?

01:49.494 --> 01:52.472
- What?
- Here, that, the snapping jaws.

01:52.474 --> 01:53.476
Madge!

01:53.478 --> 01:54.488
Yeah.

01:54.490 --> 01:57.488
Anyway, let's have those lettuces
up here, they're looking a bit limp,

01:57.490 --> 02:00.504
just like you first thing
in the morning.

02:00.506 --> 02:01.540
They look past reviving to me.

02:01.542 --> 02:05.460
Oh, no, prepare to be amazed.

02:05.462 --> 02:07.508
I'm amazed how you keep
going on about Madge.

02:07.510 --> 02:10.532
Yeah, well,
I bet she's got webbed feet.

02:10.533 --> 02:11.540
Why do you say that?

02:11.542 --> 02:14.520
Well, Stalin had webbed feet,
didn't he?

02:14.522 --> 02:16.542
Haven't you noticed the resemblance?

02:18.470 --> 02:20.488
She's only trying to protect
her sister.

02:20.490 --> 02:22.460
Yes, I know, from me.

02:22.462 --> 02:24.500
Yeah, well, she thinks
you're a scrooge.

02:24.502 --> 02:26.472
You know, you once overcharged her.

02:26.474 --> 02:29.536
It was just a reflex action,
you know, nothing personal,

02:29.538 --> 02:31.476
you know how it is.

02:31.478 --> 02:33.520
Mm, I know your lettuce
still looks limp.

02:33.522 --> 02:36.476
Yes, well,
I haven't finished with it yet.

02:36.478 --> 02:38.500
And I haven't finished with Madge.

02:38.502 --> 02:42.476
I'm going to change her
into a warm-hearted human being

02:42.478 --> 02:47.468
that will be bathing
in the loving attention of Gastric.

02:47.470 --> 02:50.464
This is the Gastric who eats mince
with his fingers?

02:50.466 --> 02:51.492
Good luck with that.

02:51.494 --> 02:54.544
It's only
when his dog pinches his spoon.

02:54.546 --> 02:58.496
Gastric only really loves his dog,
they've got so much in common -

02:58.498 --> 02:59.502
table manners.

03:00.534 --> 03:03.496
He does odd jobs, don't he? Hey?

03:03.498 --> 03:07.492
One of these days,
Madge is going to need work

03:07.494 --> 03:09.486
doing around the house, ain't she?

03:14.490 --> 03:16.460
Is that hair lacquer?

03:16.462 --> 03:17.466
Yes.

03:23.454 --> 03:27.488
And here he is now,
Mr Wonderful, who is going to take

03:27.490 --> 03:32.460
Madge on a magical journey to
the wonders of his best bedroom.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.540
- It's full of clutter.
- Mm?

03:33.542 --> 03:37.466
I have to keep it somewhere.
I sleep in the spare room.

03:38.526 --> 03:44.472
Gastric, I'm listening but it's not
exactly Grand Designs, is it? Mm?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.456
Oh, have you never been in?

03:46.458 --> 03:49.482
Oh, it's like a landfill
without the stylistic element.

03:50.486 --> 03:54.468
It's all right. I've got a bit too
much stuff, but, er, it's clean.

03:54.470 --> 03:55.536
Me and the dog like it.

03:55.538 --> 04:00.496
Gastric, if you took my advice,
you need a woman's touch.

04:00.498 --> 04:03.452
Actually, I might be on to
something there.

04:03.454 --> 04:04.536
Oh, great, Gastric,

04:04.538 --> 04:08.540
at last you've come round
to the advantages of Madge, eh?

04:08.542 --> 04:12.536
Madge? No, it's not Madge.
It's her in Kingsley Street,

04:12.538 --> 04:14.460
that little widow.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.452
Oh, can she cook.

04:17.454 --> 04:20.486
She does a rhubarb crumble
you could set to music.

04:27.482 --> 04:30.496
I don't know, they get false teeth,

04:30.498 --> 04:33.476
a few liver spots, wobbly knees,

04:33.478 --> 04:36.464
you think they're safe,
and the next thing you know,

04:36.466 --> 04:40.490
they're enticing easily-led men
with their rhubarb crumble.

04:41.522 --> 04:45.448
And you know Gastric's easily led
because you're always leading him.

04:45.450 --> 04:48.450
- Yes, towards happiness.
- Yeah, yours.

04:49.474 --> 04:50.532
You're onto a loser anyway.

04:50.534 --> 04:53.482
I don't think Gastric
even likes Madge. Oh.

04:54.526 --> 04:56.468
Of course he likes Madge.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.468
No, you just keep telling him
he likes Madge.

04:58.470 --> 05:01.534
Right, you tell them often enough
and they begin to believe it.

05:03.482 --> 05:05.502
He te-te-te-te-taught me that.

05:08.526 --> 05:10.544
I must admit,
I've always been tempted

05:10.546 --> 05:12.516
by the contents of that shop.

05:12.518 --> 05:14.538
Especially him behind the counter.

05:16.470 --> 05:18.480
How are you doing with Mr Newbold?

05:18.482 --> 05:21.476
He of the now-startled expression.

05:21.478 --> 05:23.544
- Mr who?
- Oh, come on.

05:23.546 --> 05:26.544
You've near as damn it
kidnapped him.

05:26.546 --> 05:30.486
He's lost his natural colour
and gone 50 shades of grey.

05:31.518 --> 05:33.492
Oh, he's just for practice.

05:33.494 --> 05:35.496
You've got to keep your hand in.

05:35.498 --> 05:39.460
Though I think I can safely say
we have reached stage one.

05:39.462 --> 05:41.524
The one where he's terrified of you.

05:41.526 --> 05:43.492
Yes, that's the one.

05:43.494 --> 05:45.468
You've got to keep
a certain distance -

05:45.470 --> 05:47.492
desirable but just out of reach.

05:47.494 --> 05:49.508
Ah, but is he reaching?

05:49.510 --> 05:53.492
No. I think I've some work
to do on that.

05:53.494 --> 05:55.532
I must jog his memory.

05:55.534 --> 05:58.536
I think I might take him to
Marks & Spencer and walk him

05:58.538 --> 06:00.486
through ladies' underwear.

06:04.542 --> 06:07.544
I know Gastric is about
the same height as Tom Cruise,

06:07.546 --> 06:10.540
but that is where
the resemblance ends.

06:10.542 --> 06:14.544
Maybe we ought to emphasise
his practical skills.

06:14.546 --> 06:17.460
Gastric is the bloke
you go to round here

06:17.462 --> 06:18.508
when you've got a blocked drain.

06:18.510 --> 06:21.528
It's a bit far out
on the fringe of sex appeal.

06:21.530 --> 06:24.508
Oh, there's always a warm welcome

06:24.510 --> 06:27.526
when you've got a man with
a golden touch with effluent.

06:30.494 --> 06:33.538
Gastric is your Beethoven
of blockages.

06:35.458 --> 06:36.532
Tender hearts beat a lot faster

06:36.534 --> 06:39.512
when you've got one of those
around the house, I'll tell you.

06:39.514 --> 06:41.524
BELL RINGS

06:41.526 --> 06:44.460
Hey, what?
Will you stop jumping up like that?

06:44.462 --> 06:46.464
You're going to do yourself
an injury.

06:46.466 --> 06:50.490
Well, there may be a stranger in
the shop, you know, helping himself.

06:57.546 --> 07:01.504
Oh, er... Hello.

07:01.506 --> 07:06.492
Hello to you.
I mean, if it is just you.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.532
- Where did you come?
- Oh, I was just, er...

07:08.534 --> 07:11.516
Are you sure you haven't got
a family of six behind there?

07:11.518 --> 07:14.490
LAUGHING:
Oh! No, I'm quite alone.

07:15.542 --> 07:19.512
- Oh, you're after sympathy now,
are you?
- Well...

07:19.514 --> 07:24.484
Well, there are millions of people
that are alone, as you said.

07:24.486 --> 07:28.468
I mean, if you look at it that way,
I'm alone.

07:28.470 --> 07:33.448
That is if you don't count between
four and six every other Tuesday.

07:33.450 --> 07:36.502
I wondered if you happened
to have any loose tea.

07:37.534 --> 07:39.488
Loose tea?

07:39.490 --> 07:41.512
Yes, loose tea.

07:41.514 --> 07:44.472
Yes, yes, we have loose tea.

07:44.474 --> 07:47.522
It's so loose that if it goes
any further, it'll be lost.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.464
- Just wait a moment, sir.
- Excellent.
- Yes.

07:51.466 --> 07:53.496
I don't like teabags.

07:53.498 --> 07:57.478
No, I... I'm the same
with rhubarb crumble.

07:59.478 --> 08:04.488
I think rhubarb crumble
should be one of those substances

08:04.490 --> 08:06.474
that should be banned.

08:09.486 --> 08:10.494
There we are, sir.

08:13.462 --> 08:16.462
Loose tea, Â£2.75, if you please.

08:20.474 --> 08:23.456
Right, you, count to ten,
come in here.

08:23.458 --> 08:26.458
- What?
- Close your mouth,
I can see your socks.

08:28.458 --> 08:30.520
They're clean,
and how do I know they are clean?

08:30.522 --> 08:33.511
Because I washed them, and yours
and your breakfast pot.

08:33.514 --> 08:37.506
Ohh!
Don't get your pinny in a twist.

08:39.474 --> 08:41.528
That's another thing,
right, my image,

08:41.530 --> 08:43.484
should it be wearing a pinny?

08:43.486 --> 08:47.450
Well, it makes a change, normally
you're wearing a bit of totty.

08:48.466 --> 08:49.520
Didn't you at my age?

08:49.522 --> 08:51.510
No, it hadn't been invented.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.460
Anyway, count to ten, come in here.

08:56.462 --> 08:57.504
You want me in the shop?

08:57.506 --> 09:02.448
After you've counted to ten. You
know ten is, it's comes after nine.

09:02.450 --> 09:03.504
What is all this about?

09:03.506 --> 09:06.492
We've got a flaw in our security.

09:06.494 --> 09:11.466
Oh, ye gods, let's hope NATO
are scrambling their F-16s.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.480
Right. One,

09:16.482 --> 09:18.456
two, three...

09:18.458 --> 09:20.458
QUICKLY:
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

09:22.510 --> 09:25.498
Gone. Can't even keep
an appointment.

09:27.510 --> 09:29.452
I'm here!

09:29.454 --> 09:32.450
- Where?
- Exactly, you can't see me.

09:33.462 --> 09:34.512
We've got a blind spot.

09:34.514 --> 09:38.530
We could have generations of
shoplifters living behind there.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.512
Nobody goes behind there.

09:42.514 --> 09:44.528
Oh, yes, they do -
there was someone this morning.

09:44.530 --> 09:47.488
He came out and his pockets
were bulging like that.

09:47.490 --> 09:49.546
Oh, you saw his pockets bulging?

09:51.486 --> 09:53.512
Not exactly, no.

09:53.514 --> 09:56.508
But they're cunning, you see,
because they have these pockets that

09:56.510 --> 10:00.448
filter stuff right down their
trouser legs like that. And the women

10:00.450 --> 10:04.504
are even worse, they have these
bottomless undies that go like that.

10:04.506 --> 10:08.496
I've actually seen security men
disappear down there,

10:08.498 --> 10:09.530
never been seen again.

10:10.542 --> 10:14.476
Nah, I can't remember ever seeing
a customer go behind here.

10:14.478 --> 10:16.512
Well, they have. You go behind there,

10:16.514 --> 10:21.484
been using it like Aladdin's cave. I
tell ya, I'll give them open sesame.

10:21.486 --> 10:23.506
HE GRUMBLES

10:27.542 --> 10:32.468
When I said why don't
we do something together...

10:32.470 --> 10:34.452
It'll do you good, you big lump.

10:34.454 --> 10:37.452
Good? It don't feel like good.

10:37.454 --> 10:39.542
It feels just like shuffling off
your mortal coil.

10:41.502 --> 10:44.512
I do believe you're not
enjoying that.

10:44.514 --> 10:46.460
She's trying to kill me.

10:46.462 --> 10:47.488
Prove it.

10:47.490 --> 10:49.464
Looks like it's working.

10:49.466 --> 10:51.544
It is working. I'm going any minute.

10:51.546 --> 10:55.452
Promises, promises. Are you coming?

10:55.454 --> 10:57.480
As soon as me heart starts again.

10:57.482 --> 11:00.510
If you're not back by Tuesday,
I'm selling your computer.

11:02.498 --> 11:05.538
She would, she'd sell your computer.

11:07.490 --> 11:10.520
There was a time when she used to
smile when I walked in a room.

11:10.522 --> 11:12.448
Which room?

11:12.450 --> 11:13.466
Any room.

11:14.466 --> 11:17.452
I'm a detail man, Eric,
I like to get me facts straight.

11:17.454 --> 11:20.540
Yeah, but are you getting
any cuddles?

11:20.542 --> 11:22.524
Not since her mother moved in.

11:22.526 --> 11:23.538
Oh...

11:29.502 --> 11:31.492
Er, left a bit...

11:31.494 --> 11:34.512
Which is more than you did
at breakfast.

11:34.514 --> 11:37.544
Now tilt the top down towards you.

11:37.546 --> 11:39.528
Well, hurry up, it's heavy.

11:39.530 --> 11:42.468
Oh, come on, it's only
a little bathroom mirror.

11:42.470 --> 11:45.478
Yeah, I know, and guess whose
little bathroom mirror?

11:46.494 --> 11:50.488
Oh, enter Mavis bearing gifts.

11:50.490 --> 11:51.492
You what?

11:51.494 --> 11:53.496
Nothing, kindly adjust your mirror.

11:53.498 --> 11:55.512
Do you want this in here
or in the kitchen?

11:55.514 --> 11:58.460
Remember, I don't do complicated.

11:58.462 --> 12:01.460
You don't need complicated.

12:01.462 --> 12:05.484
I think it's magic what you do
with simple confusion.

12:05.486 --> 12:07.454
Thank you!

12:08.454 --> 12:09.516
I think.

12:09.518 --> 12:12.500
Oh, yes, anyway,
take it straight through, my love,

12:12.502 --> 12:15.478
into the kitchen, yes,
that's... that's fine.

12:18.450 --> 12:19.454
Hello?

12:22.510 --> 12:23.518
Oh...

12:25.458 --> 12:29.470
And this has been made
my Madge's very own talons, eh?

12:30.530 --> 12:33.488
I mean hands.

12:33.490 --> 12:36.516
Yes. I told her it
was for the church bazaar.

12:36.518 --> 12:38.524
Good thinking.

12:38.526 --> 12:42.464
Lying about the church,
do you think it's a good idea?

12:42.466 --> 12:46.484
Mavis, we're trying to arrange
Madge's future happiness,

12:46.486 --> 12:48.540
surely that's a good idea.

12:48.542 --> 12:52.504
It's cottage pie,
she does a lovely cottage pie.

12:52.506 --> 12:55.460
Aha, man food.

12:55.462 --> 12:59.472
Yes, we've got to get Gastric
back on a masculine diet.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.456
Goodness knows where he'll end up

13:01.458 --> 13:03.518
with this unnatural taste
for sweet stuff.

13:05.466 --> 13:06.502
Talking of sweet stuff...

13:07.538 --> 13:13.456
I've got this, er,
taste for sweet stuff...

13:13.458 --> 13:15.496
There's no answer for that,

13:15.498 --> 13:18.484
I get tongue-tied when I'm blushing.

13:18.486 --> 13:20.536
I can undo tongues.

13:20.538 --> 13:23.452
Basic grocery practice.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.528
Well, I never know what to say
when you're looking at me

13:25.530 --> 13:27.462
with both headlights.

13:28.470 --> 13:34.496
I always think yes is a good answer
when time is limited.

13:34.498 --> 13:37.448
Oh, I wish I'd worn something nicer,

13:37.450 --> 13:39.498
I'm only dressed
for bringing cottage pie.

13:40.542 --> 13:42.542
It's never been brought nicer.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.520
- Where did you go? I'm stood there
with this...
- Get... get out!

13:46.522 --> 13:48.454
Get out, get out!

13:52.530 --> 13:53.542
Oh, heck.

14:00.474 --> 14:02.522
You can get them
to fit your pocket, you know.

14:05.522 --> 14:08.480
Security. We've got a blind spot.

14:08.482 --> 14:10.492
Oh, you must've had one of them

14:10.494 --> 14:13.472
when you jumped on me
in the shop doorway.

14:13.474 --> 14:16.452
I wouldn't say jumped,
it was more like a stumble.

14:16.454 --> 14:18.456
I fell over you, you remember.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.516
I remember it felt like just
another morning,

14:20.518 --> 14:23.486
until suddenly
you're underneath a grocer.

14:26.518 --> 14:27.522
Who was?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.448
It was just an accident, Eric.

14:31.450 --> 14:34.540
Yeah, the kind of accident
that never happens to me.

14:34.542 --> 14:36.496
How's the jogging?

14:36.498 --> 14:40.530
Well, it's... er,
no replacement for pleasure.

14:42.534 --> 14:46.506
Hey, get us half a dozen
fruit scones and some cream.

14:48.474 --> 14:51.506
I'll take a couple of these nice,
fresh-looking lettuces.

14:55.470 --> 14:57.460
Fell on you, did he?

14:57.462 --> 14:58.498
Only the once.

15:00.486 --> 15:02.498
I fall over the cat occasionally.

15:06.474 --> 15:09.472
I mention this merely to point out
the difference in people's

15:09.474 --> 15:10.478
destinies.

15:19.498 --> 15:22.524
She left her husband
for some foreign waiter.

15:22.526 --> 15:25.520
The simple pleasures
of the truly desperate.

15:25.522 --> 15:28.500
You'd have thought
a tip would be enough.

15:28.502 --> 15:29.524
It makes you wonder

15:29.526 --> 15:33.488
if the husband's taken her abroad
looking for some obliging waiter.

15:33.490 --> 15:35.464
It would have to be abroad.

15:35.466 --> 15:39.458
I can't see you being able to lose
many wives in Skegness.

15:43.486 --> 15:47.492
Oh, look, a new policy.

15:47.494 --> 15:50.540
I expect they'll let him go
when he's spent a bit of money.

15:50.542 --> 15:54.472
I've never had the pleasure of being
roughly handled by Granville.

15:54.474 --> 15:56.474
He's ignored several hints.

15:58.518 --> 16:00.492
Right, that's it now.

16:00.494 --> 16:03.476
Sit yourself down, that's right.

16:03.478 --> 16:05.472
Are you feeling any symptoms yet?

16:05.474 --> 16:06.512
What symptoms?

16:06.514 --> 16:07.542
Wobbly lights.

16:10.506 --> 16:12.534
Er, ringing in the ears...

16:18.478 --> 16:20.448
Is your tongue turning green?

16:20.450 --> 16:21.690
I thought it were always green.

16:28.522 --> 16:31.512
How many fingers can you see?

16:31.514 --> 16:34.484
- Three.
- Three? Wrong, only two.

16:34.486 --> 16:36.464
You started with three.

16:36.466 --> 16:40.448
Oh-ho, it's getting worse,
tendency to imagine things.

16:40.450 --> 16:43.490
Leroy, go and get me
a thermometer, will you?

16:45.522 --> 16:47.508
I haven't got a temperature.

16:47.510 --> 16:50.452
Haven't got a temperature?
Cor, I can feel you from here!

16:50.454 --> 16:52.544
Ooh, you're like a Turkish bath.

16:52.546 --> 16:57.476
Now listen, Gastric, I'm going
to ask you a question, right?

16:57.478 --> 17:01.492
What do you know
about... the Black Death?

17:01.494 --> 17:03.524
It killed a lot of people.

17:03.526 --> 17:07.544
Wiped out half the Western world.
Do you know why?

17:07.546 --> 17:10.464
Er...

17:10.465 --> 17:12.480
Rats.

17:12.482 --> 17:16.500
Urban legend.
Everybody thinks it was rats.

17:16.502 --> 17:22.455
The Black Death, Gastric, was brought
from the Indies by a cook

17:22.458 --> 17:27.455
who was making a meal so toxic
and contagious...

17:27.458 --> 17:28.498
Bad meat.

17:30.478 --> 17:31.526
Rhubarb crumble.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.448
LAUGHING:
Give over!

17:36.450 --> 17:39.456
You're trying to tell me
the Black Death were caused

17:39.458 --> 17:40.484
by rhubarb crumble?

17:40.486 --> 17:42.484
You didn't know?

17:42.486 --> 17:44.498
So why do they call it
the Black Death?

17:46.462 --> 17:48.468
It wipes out half the planet,

17:48.470 --> 17:51.468
they're not going to call it
magnolia, are they?

17:51.470 --> 17:52.500
There's only this.

17:52.502 --> 17:55.454
Right, OK. Open wide.

18:01.490 --> 18:03.540
I don't know how they do it.

18:03.542 --> 18:06.476
It turns my stomach over.

18:06.478 --> 18:07.518
I daren't look.

18:20.506 --> 18:21.510
Right, ladies.

18:22.522 --> 18:24.510
Who put a rocket behind you?

18:26.490 --> 18:29.480
Prompt service, Arkwright motto.

18:29.482 --> 18:31.462
I thought it was overcharging.

18:33.466 --> 18:37.484
Pretend I'm not here
and we're unrelated. She's upset.

18:37.486 --> 18:40.542
I'm not surprised if she's been
hanging upside down all night.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.540
I beg your pardon?

18:45.542 --> 18:49.540
I was persuaded to come here
in a moment of dizziness.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.456
Have you got a chair?

18:51.458 --> 18:53.520
Yes, if it improves her personality.

18:53.522 --> 18:56.450
I doubt it,
but can we have one anyway?

18:57.466 --> 18:59.544
Don't fuss,
I'll be all right in a minute.

18:59.546 --> 19:03.448
I'm usually a strong person.

19:03.450 --> 19:06.460
People come to me
for advice on being awkward.

19:06.462 --> 19:08.470
Yes, I know - nobody does it better.

19:09.526 --> 19:12.528
I told you not to trust him,
he's a flatterer.

19:12.530 --> 19:16.492
There's a man in a cherry picker
in the next street -

19:16.494 --> 19:20.524
she can't bear to watch anybody
working at dangerous heights.

19:20.526 --> 19:24.460
It makes my knees go to jelly.

19:24.462 --> 19:27.454
You have to admire
the sheer bravery.

19:38.490 --> 19:39.492
Hey?

19:39.494 --> 19:41.516
A little bird tells me

19:41.518 --> 19:46.460
that there's a cherry picker
in the next street, right?

19:46.462 --> 19:50.452
Now, if we bung the driver
a few quid,

19:50.454 --> 19:52.468
or maybe less,

19:52.470 --> 19:55.448
we might be able to borrow it
and get someone to fix

19:55.450 --> 19:57.476
those loose tiles on our roof.

19:57.478 --> 19:59.512
Well, I'm not going up
in a cherry picker -

19:59.514 --> 20:01.532
I've got no head for lows,
never mind heights.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.452
No, no, not you.

20:03.454 --> 20:07.544
We need an intrepid hero fresh from
his adventures with the Black Death.

20:07.546 --> 20:10.514
Oh, not to mention
a rusty thermometer.

20:14.522 --> 20:17.500
Buy one WHAT, get one free?

20:17.502 --> 20:18.526
I think it's a trap.

20:20.466 --> 20:21.587
We could go in and find out.

20:23.482 --> 20:26.520
Listen to me, weird stuff
goes on in there.

20:26.522 --> 20:28.492
He's got a big voodoo.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.512
He's got a big gob, that's all.

20:30.514 --> 20:33.524
It's more than that,
he's had me too many times.

20:33.526 --> 20:36.506
- I am normally Mr Immovable.
- Pfft.

20:40.546 --> 20:43.512
That's funny,
your wife says you're a pussy.

20:43.514 --> 20:46.492
She's desperate to make me
sound unattractive to other women,

20:46.494 --> 20:48.496
she knows I'm a rock.

20:48.498 --> 20:51.532
I exercise,
I've got these great pecks.

20:51.534 --> 20:54.534
No, don't show me, I'm a vegetarian.

20:56.450 --> 20:58.544
So am I. That's another thing,
he sells me meat.

20:58.546 --> 21:01.506
You go in there and he's got you,
it's uncanny.

21:04.502 --> 21:07.516
That's it, well hidden,
that should do it -

21:07.518 --> 21:12.490
the Arkwright portable
shoplifter's alarm system.

21:13.502 --> 21:17.540
Secreted under the mat,
one false step and bingo.

21:17.542 --> 21:20.488
Yeah, well, at least
I've got my mirror back.

21:20.490 --> 21:23.494
Yes, right. Well, you go around
and give it a try, go on.

21:24.526 --> 21:26.452
Go on, chop chop.

21:26.454 --> 21:28.534
And don't walk round it just
cos you know it's there.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.538
ALARM SOUNDS LOUDLY

21:39.534 --> 21:42.448
Scare somebody to death with that.

21:42.450 --> 21:45.452
Well, they shouldn't go
nosing around my blind spot.

21:45.454 --> 21:47.472
You're going to give somebody
a heart attack.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.486
Give? Oh, I'll sell somebody
a heart attack.

21:56.498 --> 21:58.484
Does he know yet?

21:58.486 --> 21:59.512
Who?

21:59.514 --> 22:01.482
Our intrepid astronaut.

22:02.482 --> 22:05.488
I've given him a call.
He's, er, on his way now.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.516
Does he know that he's going up
in this thing?

22:07.518 --> 22:10.484
I thought that we'd surprise him.

22:10.486 --> 22:13.520
- You can't...
- It's all right,
calm down, will you?

22:13.522 --> 22:16.516
He's not going to Mars,
he's only going as far as the roof.

22:16.518 --> 22:18.514
Ey up, here he is now. Sh, sh.

22:19.514 --> 22:22.478
Ohh, you wouldn't get me up
in one of these.

22:25.514 --> 22:26.530
What can I do you for?

22:29.450 --> 22:30.520
Excuse me.

22:30.522 --> 22:31.526
Gastric...

22:33.450 --> 22:38.472
How would you like to turn
a lady's knees to jelly? Mm?

22:38.474 --> 22:41.540
Make her heart beat a little faster?

22:41.542 --> 22:45.536
Make her believe that
you are the man?

22:45.538 --> 22:48.524
GASTRIC CHUCKLES

22:48.526 --> 22:50.466
She'd have to like dogs.

22:52.474 --> 22:55.496
If she liked dogs,
I could live with that.

22:55.498 --> 22:56.502
Well...

22:57.546 --> 22:59.458
That's if you live.

23:05.470 --> 23:07.536
What did he mean,
"That's if you live"?

23:07.538 --> 23:13.468
If you live to be 100,
you'll never have a prouder moment.

23:13.470 --> 23:15.470
That's IF you live to be 100.

23:16.498 --> 23:19.516
I've got this funny feeling
there's something going off here.

23:19.518 --> 23:21.504
You don't mind me asking?

23:21.506 --> 23:25.452
No, no, this is a truth emporium.
Ask away, Gastric.

23:25.454 --> 23:28.508
I mean, I've just had this narrow
brush with the Black Death.

23:28.510 --> 23:33.472
Yes, I know. It's miraculous
how you've pulled through.

23:33.474 --> 23:35.492
I were just saying that to Leroy.

23:35.494 --> 23:37.476
I'm not going a funny colour.

23:37.478 --> 23:38.482
Not yet.

23:39.546 --> 23:42.452
No, no, no, you're not going
a funny colour.

23:42.454 --> 23:45.476
You're not going green
or anything like that.

23:45.478 --> 23:47.508
What you are going,

23:47.510 --> 23:52.480
you're going to turn
a lady's knees to jelly.

23:52.482 --> 23:58.524
She is going to look upon you
as her knight in shining armour.

23:58.526 --> 24:01.542
Yes, and here is your helmet.

24:05.530 --> 24:07.462
Sir Lancelot.

24:10.518 --> 24:13.468
I don't know why you can't
turn knees to jelly

24:13.470 --> 24:15.516
but stay on the floor.

24:15.518 --> 24:19.460
You're going up to inspect my roof,

24:19.462 --> 24:23.448
to cast your expert eye
over my slates,

24:23.450 --> 24:26.460
to make sure
there are none loose.

24:26.462 --> 24:28.490
I can tell you where
there's a few loose.

24:29.502 --> 24:31.508
Well, who's driving this thing?

24:31.510 --> 24:35.538
Well, you are, that's the beauty
of it. You are in control.

24:37.538 --> 24:41.516
Yeah, everything you need
is right in front of you.

24:41.518 --> 24:44.472
Remember, knees to jelly.

24:44.474 --> 24:45.510
Mine included.

24:49.494 --> 24:51.544
ENGINE STARTS
My mother used to add
a dash of cinnamon,

24:51.546 --> 24:54.524
and that was before all
this foreign travel.

24:54.526 --> 24:59.472
Oh, my second husband was inclined
to overeat on spices.

24:59.474 --> 25:02.460
Was that overeat or overheat?

25:02.462 --> 25:05.512
Both, if I didn't deflect him
sharply with something depressing.

25:05.514 --> 25:07.540
- Oh, oh, oh!
- I bet you did a good depressing.

25:07.542 --> 25:10.480
Always, I like to keep one handy.

25:10.482 --> 25:12.540
There was a time when I felt
depressed, and then I thought...

25:12.542 --> 25:14.500
- Ah!
- Are you sure?

25:14.502 --> 25:15.538
Oh!

25:17.538 --> 25:20.538
I'm going in,
I daren't watch this.

25:34.522 --> 25:35.526
Oh!

25:45.494 --> 25:48.508
Ba, that Madge is
quick on the blouse.

25:48.510 --> 25:52.476
I think I did, I think
I turned her knees to jelly.

25:52.478 --> 25:55.452
Well, you went everywhere
but the roof.

25:55.454 --> 25:58.526
Listen, where I've been is much
more interesting than your roof.

26:00.462 --> 26:03.448
- You think she's made an impression?
- Attractive woman, that Madge.

26:03.450 --> 26:04.508
Hey, come along now,

26:04.510 --> 26:08.458
let's get you into something
more comfortable, go on.

26:11.454 --> 26:14.466
Mavis. Mavis, stay there.

26:16.534 --> 26:18.504
Listen, listen.

26:18.506 --> 26:23.456
I want you to hide.
And when Gastric comes back in,

26:23.458 --> 26:27.508
I want you to surprise him
with this gift from Madge.

26:27.510 --> 26:30.488
Yeah, ha-ha, oooh.

26:30.490 --> 26:31.498
Yes.

26:33.522 --> 26:35.468
Surprise him?

26:35.470 --> 26:36.512
Hide.

26:36.514 --> 26:39.530
Oh, you can do this, Mavis!

26:44.482 --> 26:46.472
Best go and see to the dog.

26:46.474 --> 26:51.480
Ah, Gastric, just a minute.
No, your day isn't over yet.

26:51.482 --> 26:55.460
We've got a surprise for you,
from Madge.

26:55.462 --> 26:58.450
ALARM, MAVIS SCREAMS

27:21.542 --> 27:25.544
'I think Madge is beginning to
get beneath Gastric's crust.

'this will help you breathe.'
