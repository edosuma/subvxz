WEBVTT

00:47.199 --> 00:50.285
It was him!
He did it.

00:50.368 --> 00:53.787
Then his hog got
in my corn again.

00:53.871 --> 00:58.376
He had no fence that would hold it,
so I put it in my pen.

00:58.460 --> 01:02.255
I told him he could have his hog back
when he paid me a dollar pound fee.

01:02.297 --> 01:04.882
What did he say to that?
"He didn't say nothin'."

01:04.965 --> 01:08.386
But yesterday
I got his answer, all right.

01:08.470 --> 01:10.429
My barn burned!

01:10.471 --> 01:14.099
A barn burner is the meanest,
lowest creature there is.

01:14.141 --> 01:17.602
I can't find against you,
Quick. There's no proof.

01:17.644 --> 01:19.979
But I can give you some advice.

01:20.063 --> 01:23.108
Leave this county
and don't come back to it.

01:23.192 --> 01:25.152
You're the judge.

01:25.194 --> 01:29.155
That'll do. Take your belongings
and get out before dark.

01:34.662 --> 01:38.332
15
00:02:03,939... > 00:02:07,317
The long

02:07.359 --> 02:10.571
Hot summer

02:10.654 --> 02:13.574
Seems to know every time

02:13.657 --> 02:16.578
You're near

02:16.661 --> 02:19.747
And the touch of a breeze

02:19.831 --> 02:23.168
Gently stirs all the trees

02:23.251 --> 02:25.670
And a bird wants to please

02:25.712 --> 02:29.174
My ear

02:29.257 --> 02:32.342
The long

02:32.384 --> 02:35.261
Hot summer

02:35.344 --> 02:38.431
Seems to know what a flirt

02:38.514 --> 02:40.933
You are

02:41.017 --> 02:44.188
Seems to know your caress

02:44.271 --> 02:47.608
Isn't mine to possess

02:47.691 --> 02:50.444
How could someone possess

02:50.527 --> 02:54.447
A star

02:54.530 --> 03:00.077
But you may long for me

03:00.161 --> 03:05.792
Long before the fall

03:05.876 --> 03:11.172
Long before the winds announce

03:11.255 --> 03:16.302
That winter's come to call

03:16.385 --> 03:19.138
And meanwhile

03:19.222 --> 03:22.517
I'll court you

03:22.600 --> 03:24.727
And meanwhile

03:24.810 --> 03:28.814
I'll kiss you

03:28.897 --> 03:33.276
Meanwhile my lonely arms

03:33.318 --> 03:36.404
Will hold you

03:36.488 --> 03:40.326
Strong

03:41.619 --> 03:45.330
And meanwhile

03:45.413 --> 03:48.834
The long

03:48.917 --> 03:52.504
Hot summer

03:52.587 --> 03:57.759
Slowly moves along

03:57.801 --> 03:59.928
Oh, so slowly

03:59.970 --> 04:07.970
Moves along

04:09.062 --> 04:10.062
Moves along

04:12.899 --> 04:17.404
50
00:04:27,662... > 00:04:32,585

04:39.258 --> 04:43.596
52
00:04:57,484... > 00:05:00,695 ""

05:26.931 --> 05:28.890
You like a lift to town?

05:28.973 --> 05:31.893
Never walk when I can ride.

05:33.520 --> 05:37.315
Just push 'em out of your way.
Thank you, ma'am.

05:37.398 --> 05:41.518
58
00:05:41,778... > 00:05:45,571
I went shopping in those Memphis stores
this morning and just went wild.

05:45.655 --> 05:48.574
Alligator bag, figured print,
summer shoes.

05:48.658 --> 05:51.410
Which is all a laugh considering
we live in Frenchman's Bend...

05:51.494 --> 05:54.748
and nobody's gonna see 'em but
redneck farmers and immediate family.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.751
I don't care though.
I got my morale to keep up.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.377
Are you two country girls?
Country?

05:59.378 --> 06:00.587
Are you two country girls?
Country?

06:00.671 --> 06:03.714
Our little town's the most nowhere place
in the state of Mississippi.

06:03.756 --> 06:07.094
You can believe me when I tell you
it laces you in tight as a corset.

06:07.177 --> 06:10.346
And as far as social amusements
are concerned, there are none.

06:10.429 --> 06:13.392
Well, that's all right.
I'm a quiet-livin' man myself.

06:13.433 --> 06:16.019
I only know one reason
for living quiet.

06:16.103 --> 06:18.564
That's if you're too old
to live any other way.

06:18.605 --> 06:22.233
In other words, you two girls just
take your fun where you can find it?

06:22.275 --> 06:24.735
Don't jump to any conclusions,
young man.

06:24.777 --> 06:28.781
We're giving you a ride, that's all.
Where are you headed?

06:28.865 --> 06:30.950
I go as far as you go, ma'am.

06:31.033 --> 06:34.744
You sound free as a bird.
Doesn't he sound free as a bird, Clara?

06:34.786 --> 06:37.581
Clara's wondering what kind of a bird,
aren't you, Clara?

06:37.622 --> 06:39.624
If you aren't a mind reader.

06:39.708 --> 06:43.211
Clara here's a schoolteacher
and mighty finicky about her reputation.

06:43.295 --> 06:45.213
She didn't want to pick you up.

06:45.297 --> 06:47.967
I said,"Why not?
There's two of us and one of him."

06:48.050 --> 06:50.761
She said,"'Cause he
looks mean and dirty."

06:50.803 --> 06:55.433
I'd say that lady is
a real fine judge of character.

06:55.475 --> 06:57.767
You've got no regard
for the safety of your person...

06:57.809 --> 07:00.437
the way you drive this Lincoln car. ""

07:00.479 --> 07:04.858
I'm getting a fallen kidney joltin'
around this countryside with you.

07:46.857 --> 07:49.902
Looks like Varner's
the man to see around here.

07:49.985 --> 07:53.572
You can find him over at our house
most any time.

07:53.656 --> 07:55.908
You two girls belong to Varner?

07:55.991 --> 07:59.370
We two girls most particularly
belong to Varner.

07:59.453 --> 08:02.581
91
00:08:33,611... > 00:08:36,574
How does a man make a living
around here?

08:36.615 --> 08:40.201
Honest or dishonest?
Let me hear what's open.

08:40.284 --> 08:43.453
Now, a fella that's hardworkin'
and clean-livin'...

08:43.538 --> 08:45.957
can plant cotton
in the bottomland...

08:46.040 --> 08:48.293
corn along the edge
of the hills.

08:48.376 --> 08:51.336
If he ain't particular, he can
make whiskey in a homemade still.

08:51.420 --> 08:54.881
And what he don't drink,
he can sell.

08:54.922 --> 08:57.800
Well, what happens
if a federal man comes by?

08:57.884 --> 09:00.553
Ooh, they've been known
to come by.

09:00.636 --> 09:02.680
Also been known to disappear.

09:02.763 --> 09:05.017
Hey, um, not entirely.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.561
No, not entirely.

09:07.644 --> 09:10.773
Missing man's shoes might show up,
or his hat...

09:10.857 --> 09:12.983
maybe even his suspenders.

09:13.066 --> 09:17.737
'Course somebody else
is wearing them.

09:19.031 --> 09:20.949
You a federal man?

09:23.952 --> 09:26.205
Well, let's say
I'm a farmer, Dad.

09:26.288 --> 09:30.041
Uh-huh.
Let's just say so.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.925
If you was to follow that road over
there, you'd come to a tenant farm.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.379
You could work
if you have a mind to.

09:35.463 --> 09:38.006
Belongs to a fellow
named Varner.

09:38.089 --> 09:40.425
What doesn't?

09:40.509 --> 09:42.595
What's your name, boy?

09:42.678 --> 09:44.722
Quick. Ben Quick.

09:46.848 --> 09:48.809
Quick?

09:48.892 --> 09:52.437
Sure now.
So that's him?

10:07.245 --> 10:09.580
Heavenly days!
There's Agnes Stewart.

10:09.664 --> 10:12.582
She called up all nervous and fluttery
this morning to say she was comin' over.

10:12.666 --> 10:16.086
I forgot to tell you about it.
Jody!

10:20.590 --> 10:24.510
Jody, I'm home!
And I spent all your money!

10:24.593 --> 10:27.263
Well, looks like you sure
had a busy day, honey.

10:27.346 --> 10:29.933
Just wait till you see
what I have for you.

10:30.016 --> 10:33.061
Bought you a red-and-white pure silk tie
and a box of brown sugar pralines...

10:33.145 --> 10:35.313
and some maroon felt
bedroom slippers.

10:35.397 --> 10:38.566
I bought you
all kinds of other things too.

10:38.649 --> 10:40.610
Whole bunch of new records
and some sport shirts.

10:40.694 --> 10:43.934
128
00:10:42,028... > 00:10:45,073
All sorts of things!
Honey, it ain't my birthday.

10:45.157 --> 10:48.867
I just wanted you to know you was
in my thoughts up there in Memphis.

10:48.950 --> 10:52.414
You just sit down and close your eyes.
I'm gonna model my purchases.

10:52.497 --> 10:54.624
You wanna know something, honey?

10:54.708 --> 10:58.460
I hate this house
when you're not in it.
Well, I'm in it now.

10:58.544 --> 11:01.714
And I'm gorgeous!

11:01.797 --> 11:03.716
Wait till you see
this new dress!

11:03.799 --> 11:06.385
They show the same one
in theJune "Vogue" magazine...

11:06.469 --> 11:09.054
only without these
little bows in the back.

11:09.138 --> 11:11.556
Salesgirl said to me,
"Miss Varner...

11:11.639 --> 11:14.057
that dress was made
in heaven for you."

11:14.141 --> 11:16.478
On account of
I'm so long waisted.

11:16.561 --> 11:19.064
She said five customers
had that dress on...

11:19.148 --> 11:21.525
and I was the only one
did anything for it.

11:21.609 --> 11:23.194
You like it?

11:24.403 --> 11:26.323
What I like is you, honey.

11:26.406 --> 11:29.116
"There's more."
There sure is.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.659
And all of it mighty pretty!

11:32.743 --> 11:35.829
Ooh! Oh, now.

11:35.913 --> 11:39.083
You come to your daddy. Come on now.
No!

11:39.167 --> 11:41.461
Come to your daddy! I got you!

11:41.544 --> 11:43.463
I got you!
Jody!

11:43.546 --> 11:46.342
What in the world's
going on up there?

11:46.425 --> 11:49.219
We don't go in much
for stately quiet around here.

11:49.302 --> 11:52.430
Where did you get
so much energy on a day like this?

11:52.514 --> 11:55.266
That party has been going on
since Papa left for the hospital.

11:55.350 --> 11:58.602
I don't see how you can stand all that
hootin' and hollerin' and carryin' on.

11:58.685 --> 12:03.066
It would turn me into a nervous wreck.
They're young and in love.

12:03.107 --> 12:05.067
"They're young."

12:05.108 --> 12:08.945
For your information, we're still
on the green side of 25 ourselves...

12:09.028 --> 12:10.947
for all the good it does us.

12:11.030 --> 12:15.411
Oh, Clara, that baby brother of yours
is like a five-year-old kid.

12:15.453 --> 12:18.289
You know what we were doing in there?
Having a pillow fight.

12:18.373 --> 12:21.834
I hit him so hard, I knocked
the wind smack out of him.

12:21.917 --> 12:24.294
Hello, Agnes sweetie.
Hello, Eula.

12:24.378 --> 12:27.256
You sure do look calm and collected
on this hot day.

12:27.297 --> 12:29.633
Well, I'm not.
I'm damp and cranky.

12:29.716 --> 12:33.929
I know what you mean. I'm going
straight into a bubble bath myself.

12:33.971 --> 12:37.599
Agnes, you bring a beau by one of these
nights, and we'll cook up a party.

12:37.641 --> 12:39.600
Hey, Eula?

12:39.642 --> 12:42.937
Oh, if I'm not mistaken,
that's my master's voice.

12:43.020 --> 12:46.439
"Bring a beau by."

12:46.481 --> 12:49.443
My phone rang
just one time last week.

12:49.485 --> 12:51.445
Just one time.

12:51.487 --> 12:55.116
And this man with a deep,
beautiful voice says...

12:55.158 --> 12:58.786
"Can I interest you in
the"Encyclopaedia Britannica?"

12:58.870 --> 13:02.123
Let's go upstairs, and I'll give you
a permanent. That'll cheer you up.

13:02.206 --> 13:05.041
Clara, you've given me three permanents
in the last six months.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.210
All my ends are splittin'.

13:07.294 --> 13:12.009
Oh, Clara, it's unnervin'
havin'all this time on my hands.

13:12.092 --> 13:16.512
I wanna rush home and fix supper
for some big, handsome man...

13:16.554 --> 13:20.516
and put kids in a bathtub
and broil steak and crank ice cream...

13:20.558 --> 13:24.019
and... think about
what the night's gonna bring.

13:24.102 --> 13:27.814
Why aren't there enough men
to go around?

13:27.856 --> 13:30.649
There's no shortage.
Just of the right kind.

13:30.691 --> 13:34.654
Ooh, I'm not fussy on that subject.
Neither am I.

13:34.738 --> 13:39.326
Tell me just one thing. Have you ever,
in your life, been proposed to?

13:39.367 --> 13:41.912
"I have."
And you let him go?

13:41.995 --> 13:45.458
No, I didn't let him go.
I watched him get scared off.

13:45.583 --> 13:49.586
Hmm, he came to call on me,
and then he met my father.

13:49.669 --> 13:52.338
Then he didn't come calling
on me anymore.

13:52.379 --> 13:58.011
Speaking of your father, when's
that august personage coming home?

13:58.094 --> 14:00.846
Tomorrow, and the forecast...

14:00.888 --> 14:03.183
is storm and thunder.

14:03.266 --> 14:06.852
Well, you come on over
to my house for supper.

14:06.936 --> 14:08.854
Alan's been askin' about you.

14:08.938 --> 14:11.857
He's sick in bed,
bein' fed milk puddin'...

14:11.941 --> 14:14.275
all dreamy with temperature.

14:14.359 --> 14:17.195
Thoroughly enjoying himself.

14:17.278 --> 14:22.826
I'd give something to know what goes on
in my brother's temperature dreams.

14:22.992 --> 14:25.703
I know what goes on in mine.

14:29.709 --> 14:32.629
Uh, don't swivel around.

14:32.712 --> 14:36.133
There's someone comin'.
Someone young.

14:36.216 --> 14:39.884
It's probably
a sewing machine salesman.

14:39.926 --> 14:44.222
Yes, well, even if it is, don't say no
right off. Let's at least talk.

14:47.725 --> 14:51.688
Morning, ladies.
Fine, warm day, isn't it?

14:51.771 --> 14:54.566
Yes, indeed.
Pretty as a picture.

14:54.649 --> 14:58.403
My, my. You all look like
two butterflies lit out on the grass.

14:58.486 --> 15:00.405
Hello again, Miss Clara.

15:00.487 --> 15:03.866
If it's work you're looking for,
you can see the foreman at the gin.

15:03.949 --> 15:06.952
If it's food, they'll take care of you
'round the back door.

15:07.035 --> 15:09.539
Well, now, you hadn't
hit on it yet, lady.

15:09.622 --> 15:12.125
What I'd like to see now
is the man of the house.

15:14.127 --> 15:16.587
Lucius?

15:21.925 --> 15:23.470
What is it, Miss Clara?

15:23.552 --> 15:27.764
Would you tell Mr. Jody there's a person
waiting to see him, please?

15:27.806 --> 15:30.518
You could have said
"gentleman."

15:30.602 --> 15:33.103
Same amount of wind.

15:38.650 --> 15:41.236
Where did you find him?

15:41.320 --> 15:44.114
Out on the road.
I gave him a lift this mornin'.

15:44.198 --> 15:46.908
Why did you have to go
and be so unfriendly?

15:46.991 --> 15:49.493
Agnes, the last, desperate
resort is strangers.

15:49.576 --> 15:52.455
We haven't come to that yet.
Oh, haven't we just.

15:52.497 --> 15:56.000
Clara, you want to hear
a cold, clinical fact?

15:56.083 --> 15:58.586
Every single girl we went
to normal school with...

15:58.669 --> 16:02.174
is married and pregnant
or about to be...

16:02.257 --> 16:04.802
while I'm residing
with my mother and brother...

16:04.885 --> 16:09.347
and you're still occupyin' the bedroom
you had when you was 13.

16:09.430 --> 16:11.431
I don't know about you, Clara.

16:11.515 --> 16:14.267
I know what's making me nervous.

16:14.351 --> 16:17.021
Well, don't throw in
the towel yet, Agnes dear.

16:17.104 --> 16:20.359
Those tranquilizers
may see us through yet.

16:21.860 --> 16:23.861
You Varner?
Yeah, I'm one Varner.

16:23.945 --> 16:27.907
"" Hey, turn that thing off, Eula!

16:27.990 --> 16:30.868
"" What can I do for you?

16:30.952 --> 16:34.870
My name's Quick.
I heard you had a farm to rent.

16:34.954 --> 16:39.194
235
00:16:37,206... > 00:16:41,252
Hey, Eula. Do you hear me? I'm gonna
come up there and kick that thing in!

16:41.335 --> 16:43.712
237
00:16:43,796... > 00:16:45,758
I'll tell you. ""

16:45.842 --> 16:49.762
How much family you got, boy?
You're looking at it.

16:49.846 --> 16:52.557
Well, a man usually puts six,
seven hands in the field.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.892
Well, one's all
you'll get from me.

16:54.976 --> 16:58.227
Jody, you've got the store
to talk business in.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.771
For heaven's sakes!
It's our passenger!

17:00.855 --> 17:02.815
How do you do, ma'am?
Hello yourself.

17:02.898 --> 17:05.234
Here now. You two know each other?
Uh-huh.

17:05.318 --> 17:07.237
How come?

17:07.319 --> 17:10.906
The how come is Clara and I obliged him
with a ride when his car broke down.

17:10.991 --> 17:14.994
Well, we're talkin' business.
Come on now. Come on now!

17:15.078 --> 17:18.164
249
00:17:18,247... > 00:17:20,540
How much rent
you able to pay, boy?

17:20.582 --> 17:25.420
How much rent you aimin' to rent for?
Oh, half your crop.

17:25.502 --> 17:29.091
You furnish out of my store.

17:29.175 --> 17:31.093
No cash?

17:31.177 --> 17:33.345
Mm-hmm.

17:33.429 --> 17:37.349
That's food and tobacco at your prices.
That makes a dollar worth
about six bits.

17:37.433 --> 17:39.436
Take it or leave it.

17:41.688 --> 17:43.606
I'll take it.

17:43.731 --> 17:46.775
258
00:17:46,859... > 00:17:52,197

17:53.740 --> 17:58.453
" Jody!"""

18:09.338 --> 18:13.300
Mister, you sure do leave
your calling card.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.532
Summertime,
when the livin' is easy.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.952
No, thank you.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.954
When are you gonna
start workin'?

18:42.037 --> 18:45.165
Lady, I never move
and work in the same day.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.044
Mr. Quick, my daddy's
coming home tomorrow.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.964
He sets quite a store by this rug.
You tracked it, you clean it.

18:53.005 --> 18:55.716
That's a lot of fuss to be makin'
about a rug, lady.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.136
If it's the rug
that's botherin' ya.

18:58.177 --> 19:00.514
What else would it be?

19:03.351 --> 19:07.396
You correct me if I'm wrong,
but I have the feeling I rile you.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.023
I mean, me being so mean
and dirty and all.

19:10.107 --> 19:14.027
You're being personal with me.
I'll be personal with you.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.112
I've spent my whole life around men
who push and shove and shout...

19:17.195 --> 19:19.990
and think they can make anything
happen just by bein' aggressive.

19:20.031 --> 19:22.534
I'm not anxious to have
another one around the place.

19:22.617 --> 19:27.206
Miss Clara, you slam a door in a man's
face 'fore he even knocks on it.

19:27.290 --> 19:31.420
Would you have the rug
at the house by 6:00, please?

19:37.258 --> 19:39.176
Thank you.

19:39.259 --> 19:42.179
Don't swallow the seeds.

19:49.061 --> 19:50.480
281
00:19:50,480... > 00:19:52,522

19:55.485 --> 19:58.988
Ernest! Sam! Orville! Marty!
You behavin' yourself?

19:59.071 --> 20:01.615
"I'm back!"

20:03.325 --> 20:07.287
285
00:20:09,580... > 00:20:12,209

20:14.711 --> 20:18.423
Varner's home.
He don't look very peaked.

20:18.507 --> 20:21.802
Anybody know what they cut
out of him in that hospital?

20:21.885 --> 20:24.553
You all can bet
it wasn't his pocketbook.

20:24.637 --> 20:29.682
290
00:20:31,351... > 00:20:34,940
Is that you, Will Varner?
"Come closer if you got any doubts."

20:35.023 --> 20:37.776
This is more
like the land of the livin'!

20:37.859 --> 20:40.403
I'm glad you made it home,
you old piece of beef!

20:40.487 --> 20:43.280
You're gettin' a little fatter, Minnie,
and a little blonder.

20:43.364 --> 20:45.908
And how 'bout you? I understand
they cut and stitched you up.

20:45.991 --> 20:48.409
Is there anything left
of you worth havin'?

20:48.493 --> 20:52.414
Put 18 cans of beer on ice and wait
and see. I'm comin' back, Minnie.

20:52.498 --> 20:55.209
Later.

20:58.964 --> 21:01.756
My white hairs kinda
had you fooled, huh?
Yes, sir.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.677
Drive on!

21:08.555 --> 21:12.432
301
00:21:18,605... > 00:21:20,568
Welcome, Mr. Will.

21:20.609 --> 21:22.736
Yeah!
Welcome to your home.

21:22.778 --> 21:25.573
Here I am, back in your
capable hands again, Lucius.

21:25.614 --> 21:28.242
Back where I belong.
Hi, Daddy Varner!

21:28.284 --> 21:32.288
Eula gal, ain't you dressed up
to beat hell!
In honor of you.

21:32.371 --> 21:34.872
That's good.

21:34.955 --> 21:39.625
Three months I ain't smelled nothin'
but the starch of nurses' uniforms.

21:39.709 --> 21:41.627
That's what I like.

21:41.711 --> 21:45.675
There's bones there, but the bones
is covered up with plenty of real woman.

21:45.758 --> 21:48.261
I was hopin' there'd be
a little more of you.

21:48.303 --> 21:51.143
Isn't it about time you was fixin'
yourself maternity dresses, Eula gal?

21:51.181 --> 21:53.599
You're embarrassin'me,
Daddy Varner.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.601
Hello, Papa.

21:55.642 --> 22:00.104
Well, well, well. There's a fulsome
greeting. There's a hallelujah chorus.

22:00.146 --> 22:02.148
Not dancin' in the streets...

22:02.231 --> 22:06.362
not an only son exactly pining
his heart away for his daddy...

22:06.446 --> 22:08.364
but simple and direct.

22:08.448 --> 22:10.365
He said hello, didn't he?

22:10.449 --> 22:13.161
Suppose we could get through the
opening ceremonies without civil war?

22:13.203 --> 22:16.664
I'll be coming to you later, sister.
I know you will, Papa.

22:16.748 --> 22:19.540
Jody's been an absolute livin' doll
while you've been gone.

22:19.624 --> 22:21.542
I'd call that
a fine recommendation...

22:21.626 --> 22:24.545
'cept I already had me a look
around town before I come here.

22:24.629 --> 22:27.798
What's happened? We gone
out of business, huh? We retired?

22:27.839 --> 22:30.092
We livin' off of income?

22:30.176 --> 22:32.845
What do I see in town? Two
dead-asleep clerks watchin' the store.

22:32.929 --> 22:34.847
And no gin goin' at all!

22:34.931 --> 22:37.517
Things may have slacked off
a little bit today, Papa...

22:37.600 --> 22:39.853
because I was home
seein' to your arrival.

22:39.937 --> 22:43.022
But we done all right.
You can look at the books if you'd like.

22:43.105 --> 22:46.900
Well, now...
I intend to.

22:46.983 --> 22:50.987
I'm gonna crawl over them books
like an old fly over flypaper.

22:51.071 --> 22:53.575
You better bring me
another, Lucius.

22:53.659 --> 22:55.785
Yes, sir, I'm my old self again.

22:55.868 --> 22:59.038
Them doctors down atJefferson,
they gutted me...

22:59.122 --> 23:02.040
and took away just about every organ
they thought I could spare.

23:02.124 --> 23:04.292
They didn't pare my spirit
down none.

23:04.376 --> 23:09.339
Thank you, Jody, for your
kindly inquiries as to my health.

23:11.216 --> 23:13.552
Next!

23:13.635 --> 23:16.389
All right, sister.

23:16.472 --> 23:19.099
You're on.

23:19.182 --> 23:21.643
What do you want to know, Papa?

23:21.726 --> 23:23.895
You still fixin'
to get yourself known...

23:23.937 --> 23:27.274
as the best-lookin', richest old maid
in the county...

23:27.357 --> 23:29.275
or you seen
any young people lately?

23:29.358 --> 23:31.277
Any young people seen you?

23:31.360 --> 23:33.905
Been to any parties, picnics,
barbecues, church bazaars?

23:33.989 --> 23:35.947
Have you mingled?
Have you mixed?

23:36.030 --> 23:39.327
Or have you kept yourself up
in that room all this time
readin' them poetry books?

23:39.411 --> 23:42.581
I hope this doesn't come as a shock
to your nervous system, Papa...

23:42.622 --> 23:45.000
but when you're away,
I do what I please.

23:45.083 --> 23:47.919
Well, I'm back!

23:47.961 --> 23:49.963
Welcome home.

23:52.797 --> 23:54.799
Lucius!

24:27.291 --> 24:31.712
When are you gonna give me
my due respect in front of my wife?

24:31.796 --> 24:33.672
I've got a business too, Jody.

24:33.756 --> 24:36.967
I've got a little respect
for that.

24:37.051 --> 24:38.968
I know you wasn't...

24:39.052 --> 24:42.096
You and me just don't
talk the same language.

24:43.473 --> 24:46.433
That's what gives us
our aches and our pains.

24:46.517 --> 24:49.437
"Now me"..."all the time"
I was in the hospital...

24:49.479 --> 24:53.065
I didn't just lay there.
I was busy.

24:53.148 --> 24:57.612
Yes, I wheeled and dealed.
That's what I done, boy. What about you?

24:57.695 --> 25:00.031
May wasn't so good.
Oh.

25:00.115 --> 25:02.240
ButJune and July made up for it.

25:02.323 --> 25:04.242
That's to be expected.

25:04.325 --> 25:07.161
I moved all our heavy farm equipment.
Oh, yeah?

25:07.203 --> 25:09.498
We're fresh out of inventory.

25:09.581 --> 25:12.000
Including that old tractor?
That's right.

25:12.084 --> 25:14.587
The one that don't go uphill?
Includin' that.

25:14.671 --> 25:16.589
Good.

25:16.673 --> 25:19.341
I rented off that tenant farm
nobody 'round here would have.

25:19.383 --> 25:23.096
And a fella come down here
from Boston, Massachusetts.

25:23.179 --> 25:27.015
He bought a lot of land
and built this big fence around it...

25:27.099 --> 25:29.016
and started a goat ranch.

25:29.100 --> 25:31.727
Only he plumb ran out of goats...

25:31.811 --> 25:33.729
and it went bust.

25:33.813 --> 25:35.732
"Yeah?"
Yeah.

25:35.815 --> 25:39.777
So, Papa, now you got 2,000 acres more
of good grassland.

25:39.861 --> 25:44.699
Well, seems like you ain't been sittin'
on your spine altogether.

25:44.740 --> 25:47.784
How'd you rent that farm off?
On shares.

25:47.868 --> 25:51.372
"Profitable?"
I had a little trouble with the man.

25:51.456 --> 25:54.375
What's the name
of this poor unfortunate?

25:54.417 --> 25:56.544
A fellow name of Quick.

25:58.713 --> 26:02.092
Quick? Ben Quick?

26:02.176 --> 26:04.595
Yeah, yeah, from out west.

26:04.678 --> 26:07.597
You knucklehead fool!

26:08.598 --> 26:10.556
You empty-headed yokel!

26:10.598 --> 26:13.976
What are you calling me names for?
"Quick!"

26:14.059 --> 26:16.688
Don't you keep abreast
of anything except Eula?

26:16.730 --> 26:20.817
Don't you know what Quick means
in this county? Hellfire!

26:20.901 --> 26:23.196
Ashes and char!

26:23.237 --> 26:26.616
Flame follows that man
around like a dog!

26:26.699 --> 26:28.950
He's a barn burner.

26:29.034 --> 26:32.537
I never do anything right. Do I?
Not to my immediate recollection!

26:32.579 --> 26:35.247
You want to hear something?
I sweat around you.

26:35.331 --> 26:38.584
All those months you were away
in the hospital, I was dry.

26:38.626 --> 26:40.587
Now I'm sweatin' again.

26:40.629 --> 26:43.341
I ain't got time
for your personal troubles.

26:43.424 --> 26:47.469
You started something with
Mr. Ben Quick, and I got to finish it...

26:47.552 --> 26:50.430
before this house of mine
goes up in smoke!

26:56.727 --> 26:59.230
403
00:27:05,944... > 00:27:07,904
I'm Varner.

27:07.946 --> 27:10.242
Yeah, I already met one Varner.

27:10.283 --> 27:12.285
I'm the other.

27:12.327 --> 27:16.790
Just driving by. Thought I'd stop
and see if you got any plans.

27:16.873 --> 27:19.499
That cabin ain't fit for hogs...

27:19.582 --> 27:22.168
but I can get along with it.

27:22.252 --> 27:24.628
Well, we can talk that over.

27:24.670 --> 27:28.675
Way I hear it, you're a boy that gets
into trouble with your landlords.

27:28.758 --> 27:31.719
The kind of trouble that might need
the help of the fire department.

27:31.803 --> 27:36.475
If you scared of me, mister, why don't
you just come right out and say so?

27:36.517 --> 27:38.477
Huh!

27:38.519 --> 27:41.188
Son, why should I
be scared of you?

27:43.231 --> 27:46.943
'Cause I got a reputation
for being a dangerous man.

27:48.153 --> 27:50.405
Hmm.

27:50.488 --> 27:53.199
You're a young, dangerous man.

27:55.452 --> 27:57.579
I'm an old one.

27:57.662 --> 28:00.540
You don't know who I am.
I better introduce myself.

28:00.623 --> 28:04.419
I'm the big landowner
and chief moneylender in these parts.

28:04.502 --> 28:08.046
I'm commissioner of elections
and veterinarian.

28:08.130 --> 28:10.507
I own the store
and the cotton gin...

28:10.549 --> 28:12.843
and the grist mill,
the blacksmith shop.

28:12.885 --> 28:16.096
It's considered unlucky for a man
to do his tradin'or gin his cotton...

28:16.180 --> 28:20.185
or grind his meal or shoe his stock...
anywhere else.

28:20.268 --> 28:22.270
Now, that's who I am.

28:22.353 --> 28:24.481
You talk a lot.

28:24.564 --> 28:26.900
Yes, I do, son.

28:26.983 --> 28:29.066
But I'm done talkin' to you...

28:29.150 --> 28:32.112
except for passing you on
this piece of information.

28:32.196 --> 28:35.783
I built me a new jail
in my courthouse this year...

28:35.866 --> 28:39.328
and if during the course of your stay
here something, anything at all...

28:39.411 --> 28:41.370
should happen to catch fire...

28:41.412 --> 28:44.958
I think you oughta know
that in my jail...

28:45.042 --> 28:48.961
we never heard of the words
"habeas corpus."

28:49.045 --> 28:51.047
You'd rot.

28:51.172 --> 28:56.218
Well, a smart man,
he'd give me a job.

28:56.301 --> 29:00.057
You're already working for me.
None of this weed-scratching.

29:00.140 --> 29:04.268
I'm talkin' about a job
that'll give me a white shirt...

29:04.352 --> 29:07.064
and a black tie
and three squares.

29:07.106 --> 29:10.984
You've got a place in your store
and several other spots
where you could use me.

29:11.068 --> 29:14.530
You'd be writing yourself a fire
insurance policy into the bargain.

29:14.613 --> 29:16.572
I'll give it some thought.

29:16.614 --> 29:19.282
Yes or no, mister.
Ain't no in-between.

29:19.366 --> 29:23.077
You're mighty bushy-tailed
for a beginner.
"I'm in a hurry."

29:23.119 --> 29:27.249
You're wasting your time.
The job at the top's already taken.

29:27.332 --> 29:31.587
But like you said, you're an old man.
I am that.

29:31.671 --> 29:33.673
You bear that in mind.

29:33.756 --> 29:36.342
Be respectful.

29:36.425 --> 29:40.094
Yes, sir, Mr. Varner.
Now, just who do I have to kill?

29:40.136 --> 29:45.100
Well, we won't start
right off with murder.

29:45.142 --> 29:49.354
Happens I just got handed me
30 Texas horses on a foreclosure.

29:49.438 --> 29:52.024
You get rid of them for me
at a reasonable profit...

29:52.108 --> 29:54.069
and we're in business.

29:56.070 --> 29:59.573
456
00:30:09,457... > 00:30:11,876
Well, there's a cool breeze
from the river, Alan.

30:11.958 --> 30:14.586
Everything nice comes
with you, Clara...

30:14.627 --> 30:18.382
hot broth, cool breeze
from the river.

30:18.466 --> 30:20.385
How's your school?

30:20.469 --> 30:23.430
You mean that free-for-all
I run in town?

30:23.513 --> 30:27.057
Those 35 hellions who are making
their last stand against me?

30:27.141 --> 30:30.686
I wouldn't say it was
a summer on the Riviera.

30:30.770 --> 30:33.564
Well, it's unnatural to keep kids
in school in the summertime.

30:33.647 --> 30:36.065
In the winter they gotta
help work on the crops.

30:36.149 --> 30:38.611
Somewhere along the line,
they gotta learn to read and write.

30:38.652 --> 30:40.613
Besides, who knows?

30:40.654 --> 30:45.493
I don't have much hope, but maybe I have
a young painter or poet cooped up there.

30:47.076 --> 30:50.413
Oh, Alan, I love this place.

30:51.748 --> 30:55.168
Grace, dignity,
beautiful things left undisturbed.

30:55.251 --> 30:57.921
Just the way they were
a hundred years ago.

30:58.004 --> 31:01.842
Most people say
I'm fighting the 20th century.

31:01.884 --> 31:04.385
I suppose I oughta
sell this place...

31:04.469 --> 31:07.305
put it to corn and cotton,
go get a job like everybody else...

31:07.347 --> 31:09.390
but I wouldn't be
any good at it.

31:09.474 --> 31:12.226
I'd hate it and make a mess of it.
Then don't do it.

31:12.309 --> 31:15.313
There are enough hustlers around here
as is. You stand for something.

31:15.355 --> 31:19.984
You hold on to it.
Your father refers to me
as decayed gentry.

31:20.068 --> 31:23.862
That's because
he is pea green with envy.

31:23.904 --> 31:28.201
You listen here. He would
give anything to have what you have.

31:28.243 --> 31:31.287
Wouldn't he just love to have
your shine and polish?

31:31.371 --> 31:35.415
He can put up all those billboards
and neon signs and fillin' stations...

31:35.499 --> 31:38.376
but quality is one thing
he can't buy, and he knows it.

31:38.417 --> 31:40.378
He has quality, Clara...

31:40.419 --> 31:42.381
in you.

31:44.675 --> 31:48.596
That's what I came through
this dusty summer day to hear.

31:48.680 --> 31:51.015
I want you to be hale
and hearty again.

31:51.057 --> 31:55.394
I want you to be your courtly, gallant
self again and come callin' on me.

31:55.436 --> 31:58.103
Very soon, ma'am.
Well, you better.

31:58.186 --> 32:01.190
Girls get all fidgety and looked at
sideways and talked about...

32:01.232 --> 32:04.193
when they don't have
their gentlemen callers.

32:04.235 --> 32:07.071
Besides, I've missed you.

32:09.241 --> 32:11.243
That boy's temperature
has been a-hoverin'...

32:11.285 --> 32:13.328
between 100 and 100 and two-tenths
for three days...

32:13.412 --> 32:16.206
so none of that now.

32:16.248 --> 32:19.293
I just brought over
some of Lucius's broth.
Oh!

32:19.375 --> 32:22.003
He won't eat a bite
I don't cook.

32:22.086 --> 32:26.507
I'm gonna hustle you right along,
'cause it's way past son's nap time.

32:27.925 --> 32:32.303
All right, Miss Stewart.
I'll give up the field for now.

32:32.386 --> 32:36.225
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Alan.

32:36.267 --> 32:38.227
Good-bye, Clara.

32:38.269 --> 32:43.482
502
00:32:43,565... > 00:32:45,233

32:45.233 --> 32:47.673
504
00:32:51,948... > 00:32:55,076
Why, you old crook, you.
Hmm.

32:55.118 --> 32:58.122
Them's horses out of hell.
That's right.

32:58.164 --> 33:01.709
Them ponies never had a rope on 'em.
You didn't tell me they was wild.

33:01.793 --> 33:03.921
Well, you knowin' that, uh...

33:03.962 --> 33:07.422
kinda gives you the edge
over everybody else, huh?

33:08.464 --> 33:12.259
510
00:33:24,355... > 00:33:26,857
Minnie Littlejohn...

33:26.941 --> 33:29.609
I'm gettin' thirsty again.

33:29.651 --> 33:32.531
Since when you been
in the horseflesh business?

33:32.614 --> 33:37.536
Ain't no kind of business.
What you're watching is
a plain old-fashioned swindle.

33:37.619 --> 33:40.996
So, of course,
I ain't involved in it directly.

33:41.038 --> 33:44.375
You hired that boy to fleece 'em?
I hired that boy...

33:44.458 --> 33:48.087
Tell you the truth, I don't know why
I hired him, but I aim to find out.

33:48.170 --> 33:50.756
Okay, come on now.
Let's gather 'round in here, folks.

33:50.840 --> 33:54.259
Come on. Let's move in here.
John, come on now.

33:54.342 --> 33:56.844
Bring your whole family down.
I don't wanna strain my tonsils.

33:56.927 --> 33:58.930
Let's go. We gonna get goin'.

33:59.013 --> 34:01.683
Mr. Armistead, I heard what you
had to say about them horses.

34:01.724 --> 34:05.270
I wouldn't hesitate to put my own sister
on one of'em if I had a sister.

34:05.353 --> 34:07.272
You there.
Now, Miss Clara?

34:07.355 --> 34:11.527
How'd you like to be the proud owner
of one of them handsome-lookin'horses?

34:11.610 --> 34:14.612
I can see you've got "no" written
all over your face, but wait.

34:14.696 --> 34:17.197
You stop and think a minute.

34:17.282 --> 34:21.911
You can pack yourself a picnic basket
and follow some woodsy trail.

34:21.995 --> 34:26.206
You can ride off steam and bad temper
if you happen to be afflicted that way.

34:26.248 --> 34:29.210
If you see a young fellow along the way
who happens to take your eye...

34:29.252 --> 34:33.047
you can put him behind you
and ride double.

34:33.130 --> 34:36.885
Uh, what's your answer,
Miss Clara?

34:36.926 --> 34:40.929
You were right the first time.
I got "no" written all over my face.

34:41.013 --> 34:43.891
That don't bother me none at all.

34:43.931 --> 34:48.020
A lot of women say"no"
when they mean"yes."
That's for sure!

34:48.101 --> 34:50.062
I ain't foolin'
about these horses.

34:50.103 --> 34:54.150
The man that buys one of these
will get the best horseflesh
he ever drove for the money.

34:54.234 --> 34:57.739
Naturally they got spirit.
I ain't sellin' no crow bait.
Who's gonna start with a bid?

34:57.822 --> 35:01.825
Tell you what I'll do. I'll give you
ten dollars for that there fiddlehead.

35:01.909 --> 35:06.162
Ten dollars? You couldn't buy
that much dynamite for ten dollars!

35:06.245 --> 35:08.998
There isn't a horse in there
can't run a mile in three minutes.

35:09.081 --> 35:11.626
You put 'em out to pasture,
they're gonna board themselves.

35:11.709 --> 35:14.504
Work 'em all day long,
and every time you think about it.

35:14.587 --> 35:17.256
Pretty soon every one of them
gonna be so tame...

35:17.340 --> 35:20.345
you'll have to put 'em out of the house
at night like a cat.

35:20.428 --> 35:25.598
Buzz!
" Who's gonna"
start it off with a bid?

35:26.641 --> 35:29.310
Minnie, what are you doin'?
Buzz!

35:29.435 --> 35:32.855
I got a hum in my blood,
and I feel as if I'd swallowed a bee.

35:32.939 --> 35:36.692
You swallowed five bottles of beer in
the hot sun. That's what you swallowed.

35:36.776 --> 35:40.278
Who's gonna give me $40 for that horse?
Ten dollars, take it or leave it.

35:40.362 --> 35:42.280
Eleven.
That's the way, Pa.

35:42.364 --> 35:44.282
Shut up, son.
" Thirteen."

35:44.366 --> 35:47.536
Wait a minute. What are you doin'?
Fifteen.

35:47.619 --> 35:50.998
Fifteen dollars. I got fifteen dollars
bid on that fiddlehead horse.

35:51.082 --> 35:53.000
Who's gonna make it 20?

35:53.084 --> 35:55.378
Kiss me, Will.

35:56.921 --> 35:59.214
I got a number of friends...

35:59.297 --> 36:01.967
and, uh, associates here.

36:02.008 --> 36:04.971
I'm your friend. I'm your associate.
I have been for ten years.

36:05.054 --> 36:06.973
Then what's the matter?

36:07.056 --> 36:10.517
Will, all this time,
this summer...

36:10.600 --> 36:14.354
all I've done is put up
22 jars of piccalilli...

36:14.438 --> 36:17.816
and I put down a corn beef
in a crock.

36:17.858 --> 36:19.942
And I say to myself...

36:19.984 --> 36:22.987
"Minnie, where is it all
gonna end?"

36:23.070 --> 36:27.158
It's gonna end with me eatin'
a corn beef. You know I'm partial to it.

36:27.241 --> 36:31.496
At midnight suppers after you've
come sneakin' up the back stairs.

36:31.580 --> 36:34.874
I want to serve it to you
right here at 6:00.

36:34.957 --> 36:37.168
Minnie.
" Forty dollars."

36:37.251 --> 36:39.670
What are you tryin' to say?

36:39.754 --> 36:42.174
I made plans, Will.

36:42.215 --> 36:43.507
Matrimonial plans.

36:43.508 --> 36:45.302
Matrimonial plans.

36:45.343 --> 36:49.847
Now, you ain't ever heard me
say the word... "matrimony."

36:49.930 --> 36:52.809
Now, I'm willin'
to overlook that.

36:52.851 --> 36:55.687
You know my married sister
in Tallahassee?
"Uh-huh."

36:55.729 --> 36:59.022
Well, she's makin' me up
some hand-crocheted sheets.

36:59.105 --> 37:03.276
And I've sent away for some flatware
with the initial "V" on it.

37:04.402 --> 37:06.403
Minnie...

37:07.530 --> 37:10.158
I'm 61 years old.

37:10.241 --> 37:15.122
Look, honey, it's no good
you tryin' to tell me you're too old.

37:15.206 --> 37:18.626
I happen to be in a position
to deny it.

37:20.419 --> 37:22.379
Hmm.

37:22.421 --> 37:25.799
Just hand it over here. Thank you,
thank you. Twenty-two dollars from you.

37:25.882 --> 37:28.676
Twenty-five from you. Thirty-two
from you, and thirty from you.

37:28.718 --> 37:30.678
Thank you, gentlemen.

37:30.720 --> 37:34.683
Don't forget 'bout bangin' them horses
over the head till they get used to you.

37:34.767 --> 37:37.728
They won't give you any trouble.
That's all there is to it?

37:37.812 --> 37:39.730
That's it.
They belong to us now?

37:39.814 --> 37:44.441
Yeah. Get yourself a rope
and go on in there and take the horse
that belongs to you.

37:44.525 --> 37:47.361
All right, we'll need some rope.
Come on, Joe.

37:52.282 --> 37:54.868
You're not much of a prospect,
Miss Clara.

37:54.910 --> 37:58.037
You don't need my money.
You've got everybody else's.

37:58.121 --> 38:00.498
Yeah, but it's the holdout
that challenges me.

38:00.582 --> 38:02.502
I'll tell you, Mr. Quick.

38:02.585 --> 38:06.172
The last time I parted with my money
to a pitchman, I was 12 years old.

38:06.256 --> 38:09.008
And nobody's ever taken you since.
Nope.

38:09.092 --> 38:11.010
Nobody ever will.

38:11.094 --> 38:14.221
Well, life's very long
and full of salesmanship, Miss Clara.

38:14.304 --> 38:17.014
You might buy somethin' yet.

38:23.897 --> 38:26.775
Here they come!
Look out!

38:26.817 --> 38:29.695
602
00:38:33,322... > 00:38:35,783

38:40.538 --> 38:42.999
Oh! ""

38:43.082 --> 38:45.460
605
00:38:45,501... > 00:38:47,629
That's a musical horse.

38:47.713 --> 38:50.873
607
00:38:49,839... > 00:38:53,091
Here, don't you bring
your filthy feet in here!

38:56.429 --> 39:00.099
They'll go on all night
tryin' to catch them rabbits.

39:00.183 --> 39:02.944
611
00:39:02,727... > 00:39:05,563
Boy, you got something
belongs to me.

39:05.646 --> 39:08.315
You ain't no better
than a crook.

39:08.398 --> 39:11.903
Well, you ain't nothin' better
than a con man.

39:11.986 --> 39:13.946
You sell my crooked merchandise.

39:13.988 --> 39:17.449
Never mind the name-calling.
Now, where's my share?

39:17.491 --> 39:19.993
I got somethin' for you, boy.

39:21.244 --> 39:23.247
Come on.

39:26.124 --> 39:29.628
Whoa, you!
Head 'em off! Head 'em off!

39:33.422 --> 39:35.342
Whoa!

39:35.425 --> 39:38.470
Ah, you wild-eyed
stallion, you!

39:52.901 --> 39:57.365
The man that built this place,
his name's forgotten.

39:58.616 --> 40:02.368
This was his dream
and his pride.

40:02.451 --> 40:05.704
Now it's dust.

40:05.746 --> 40:08.040
Must be a moral there somewhere.

40:08.082 --> 40:10.542
Looks like that's about all there is.
I don't know.

40:10.583 --> 40:12.544
They got a legend
about this place.

40:12.627 --> 40:15.547
They do say there's money buried
around here on the grounds...

40:15.588 --> 40:18.550
at the time Grant overrun the country
on the way to Vicksburg.

40:18.591 --> 40:21.554
What's that got to do with me?
I been watching you.

40:21.595 --> 40:24.390
I like your push.

40:24.473 --> 40:28.185
Yes, I like your style.
I like your brass.

40:28.269 --> 40:31.230
It ain't too dissimilar
from the way I operate.

40:31.272 --> 40:34.065
You've been here a few days,
you've gone up an inch.

40:34.107 --> 40:36.067
That's 'cause you listen to me.

40:36.109 --> 40:39.696
You go on listenin' to me, and someday,
in a wild burst of generosity...

40:39.737 --> 40:42.574
I might just make you a present
of this place.

40:42.615 --> 40:45.078
Thank you for nothing.
It's falling apart.

40:45.162 --> 40:48.079
You're a shrewd boy.

40:48.121 --> 40:50.914
You'll find a way
of gettin' some good out of it.

40:50.956 --> 40:55.169
Mister. You've been makin' me
a lot of promises.

40:55.252 --> 40:57.588
One of these days
I'm gonna collect on 'em.
Surely.

40:57.629 --> 41:00.090
I just ain't passin'
the time of day with you.

41:00.132 --> 41:02.676
I'm aware of that.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.880
645
00:41:06,013... > 00:41:09,225
Come to supper with me, boy,
at the big house.

41:11.268 --> 41:13.730
You ornery critter!

41:13.813 --> 41:16.813
648
00:41:16,441... > 00:41:19,194
There goes another one
on the creek bridge.

41:19.277 --> 41:22.238
Could be, you know,
them poor unfortunates...

41:22.280 --> 41:24.990
could come out ahead
on the deal after all...

41:25.074 --> 41:27.700
get their money's worth
in health and outdoor exercise.

41:27.784 --> 41:32.122
A night like this is good for him.
It stimulates his liver.

41:32.206 --> 41:35.291
Oh, they'll catch
those horses, Mr. Varner.

41:35.374 --> 41:37.835
They'll catch them and make
good work teams out of them.

41:37.919 --> 41:42.007
You figure you know them redneck farmers
better than me, huh?

41:42.091 --> 41:45.371
657
00:41:44,092... > 00:41:47,678
Suppose that's 'cause
the, uh, Stewart family's...

41:47.762 --> 41:50.264
been in these parts a little longer
than the Varners.

41:50.348 --> 41:52.308
About 200 years.

41:52.350 --> 41:54.479
That's a long time
to live in one place.

41:54.562 --> 41:57.147
You don't believe
in living in one place, Mr. Quick?

41:57.231 --> 42:00.066
Well, my family moved.
Not that they wanted to.

42:00.149 --> 42:02.735
They was encouraged
by the local citizens.

42:02.819 --> 42:06.948
You a hunted man or somethin'?
Somethin', Miss Eula.

42:07.031 --> 42:10.410
I'd like to hear
a yes or no answer to that, boy.

42:10.493 --> 42:12.662
Well, ifhe's hunted...

42:12.745 --> 42:14.664
he ain't caught.

42:14.747 --> 42:18.334
Lucius, pass the drinks. Who's for
drinkin' some of my fine brandy, huh?

42:18.418 --> 42:20.961
Alan, you're partial
to my brandy.

42:21.002 --> 42:24.339
Let's see. How many years
you been drinkin' it now, huh?

42:24.423 --> 42:26.341
Five? Six?

42:26.425 --> 42:29.344
I've enjoyed your hospitality
a long time, Mr. Varner.

42:29.428 --> 42:32.973
I sometimes ask myself, do we get
the major part of your attention...

42:33.014 --> 42:36.393
or are you brightenin' up
other parlors around the county?

42:36.476 --> 42:39.479
That's Alan's
personal business, Papa.

42:39.563 --> 42:41.525
Don't get yourself fussed,
sister.

42:41.567 --> 42:44.568
Alan knows a friendly inquiry
when he hears it, don't you, Alan?

42:44.651 --> 42:47.279
When I hear one.
Sure, sure!

42:47.362 --> 42:50.490
A friendly inquiry
never bothered nobody.

42:50.574 --> 42:53.617
As I understand it,
when you ain't here with us...

42:53.701 --> 42:57.580
you keep pretty close to your house,
uh, with your mother.

42:57.663 --> 43:00.166
Papa, I can't stand this.

43:00.207 --> 43:03.212
I think you've forgotten, Mr. Varner,
that my mother is a widow.

43:03.254 --> 43:06.047
She relies strongly on me.
Widow?

43:06.131 --> 43:09.175
Your old man ain't dead.
He just disappeared.

43:09.258 --> 43:11.969
Just wandered off.

43:12.052 --> 43:14.847
The end result is the same.
She's alone.
No, she ain't, Alan.

43:14.889 --> 43:16.932
She's got you.

43:17.016 --> 43:19.101
She sure has you.

43:19.185 --> 43:22.061
I do my best.
Not around here, you don't!

43:22.103 --> 43:25.303
692
00:43:24,189... > 00:43:28,903
Jody, you seem to enjoy
my conversation tonight.

43:28.986 --> 43:31.572
Guess I'll direct a little bit at you.
"I didn't say nothin'."

43:31.655 --> 43:33.574
You see Ben Quick here?

43:33.657 --> 43:37.161
He's goin'to work tomorrow in the store
as a clerk right alongside of you.

43:37.244 --> 43:41.457
He's going to receive the same
identical wages, the same benefits.

43:42.750 --> 43:46.086
That don't seem to strike you
as quite so funny.

43:47.921 --> 43:49.840
It don't.

43:49.924 --> 43:52.717
What I mean to say is, Jody,
with Ben around...

43:52.759 --> 43:54.929
you can sleep late mornings.

43:55.012 --> 43:57.515
That is, as late as you figure
you can afford to.

44:01.141 --> 44:03.477
Outside, everybody!

44:03.560 --> 44:06.522
Take the evenin' air.

44:22.330 --> 44:24.791
Alan, I apologize
for what we are.

44:24.874 --> 44:26.918
Don't, Clara.
It isn't necessary.

44:26.960 --> 44:29.504
I wouldn't blame you
if you left right now.

44:29.587 --> 44:32.006
Other young men have
with much less cause than this.

44:32.090 --> 44:35.551
My people have stood off Indians,
Yankees, carpetbaggers.

44:35.634 --> 44:39.887
The least they could expect of me
is to stand up to a Varner.

44:39.971 --> 44:43.599
All right then.
Let's go have some more.

44:45.101 --> 44:49.356
" Eula! Eu-ooh-la!"""

44:49.440 --> 44:51.358
Oh, listen to that.

44:51.442 --> 44:55.486
If those boys don't sound like
a bunch of tomcats yowling at the moon.

44:55.570 --> 44:58.240
Eula! Eula!

44:58.323 --> 45:01.368
Isn't it terrible the way they come
prowlin' around here every night?

45:01.452 --> 45:04.288
It's like that in town too.
They follow me wherever I go.

45:04.329 --> 45:07.249
Don't go anywhere then. You stay put.
Oh, now.

45:07.332 --> 45:09.751
You stay right close to home.
Jody, they're harmless.

45:09.834 --> 45:12.962
They're only 16, 17 years old.
You call that harmless?

45:13.045 --> 45:16.883
"Eula!"
"Hey, Eula!"

45:16.966 --> 45:20.428
You quit it out there,
or I'll pass among you with a shotgun!

45:20.511 --> 45:23.015
"Hey, Eula, come out!"

45:23.098 --> 45:25.808
"Eula! Come on out!"
"Come on out, Eula!"

45:25.850 --> 45:28.685
Come on, Eula. Get out of the light!
Oh!

45:28.727 --> 45:32.522
They don't have to see her.
They can smell her.

45:32.564 --> 45:34.858
"Eula!"
"Eula!"

45:34.941 --> 45:37.778
Tom Shortly, V.K. Bookwright,
John Fischer!

45:37.861 --> 45:40.197
Now, I know it's you out there!
Now, quit it!

45:40.238 --> 45:43.410
" Eula!"
Would somebody please make them stop?

45:43.494 --> 45:46.622
Just wait. I'll stop 'em.
"Eula! Eula!"

45:46.705 --> 45:48.623
It's a madhouse around here.

45:48.706 --> 45:53.752
They're just young boys.
Healthy, young animals.

45:53.835 --> 45:57.297
How come they don't come
to anybody else's house,
hide in anybody else's garden?

45:57.380 --> 46:01.258
It's just us that gets singled out.
We're the ones that got Eula.

46:01.342 --> 46:03.594
It's not her fault.
It's yours.

46:03.677 --> 46:07.139
They come here 'cause they know
you're gonna laugh,
you're gonna think it's funny...

46:07.223 --> 46:09.559
no matter how crude
and how vulgar!

46:09.601 --> 46:12.687
I was young myself once.

46:12.729 --> 46:17.442
I used to hide in the greenery
and hoot and bellow.

46:17.526 --> 46:21.612
I'll bet you did. I'll bet you
stayed longest and yelled loudest.

46:21.695 --> 46:25.116
Your mama listened.

46:38.421 --> 46:40.339
Blackjack!

46:40.423 --> 46:43.467
744
00:46:43,551... > 00:46:45,928
All right.

46:45.970 --> 46:48.931
Now let's deal 'em off the top.

46:48.973 --> 46:51.142
Huh.

46:52.852 --> 46:56.771
Is that the way
you acquired your fortune?
The way you're acquiring mine?

47:06.615 --> 47:10.784
Those boys sure do make
their desires plain, don't they?

47:10.868 --> 47:15.457
Callin' and callin',
just like they thought Eula
was gonna get up and follow 'em.

47:15.540 --> 47:17.959
Wonder what would happen
if she did.

47:18.042 --> 47:20.462
I imagine there'd
be quite a romp.

47:20.545 --> 47:24.424
Now, why did I make
such a fuss about it?

47:24.466 --> 47:27.260
Because it offended you?

47:27.302 --> 47:29.428
No, it didn't.

47:29.511 --> 47:32.474
Now that's the plain,
unvarnished truth at last.

47:32.515 --> 47:36.644
No, Alan, there's no sense in pretendin'
that girls don't think about sex.

47:36.728 --> 47:38.688
They do.

47:38.772 --> 47:41.649
You oughta hear some of the
conversations between Agnes and me.

47:41.691 --> 47:43.651
Uh, I'd like to.

47:43.693 --> 47:48.154
Well, there's nothing wrong
with being anxious about your love life.

47:48.237 --> 47:50.239
I am about mine.

47:52.867 --> 47:56.987
763
00:47:56,079... > 00:48:00,502
This is certainly not the way I expected
this conversation to be going.

48:00.585 --> 48:04.463
I thought we were gonna sit here
on the front porch
and let the moon shine down on us...

48:04.505 --> 48:08.008
and, just like those boys in the bushes,
let nature take its course.

48:08.092 --> 48:11.261
Why, Clara, nature
is taking its course.

48:11.345 --> 48:15.891
You're not the kind of girl
to be howled at and dragged
off the porch into the bushes.

48:15.974 --> 48:18.852
You're a nice, quiet,
self-contained girl.

48:18.894 --> 48:22.855
You'll see. Everything you want's
gonna happen to you.

48:29.779 --> 48:31.781
Oh, evening, Alice.

48:31.864 --> 48:34.367
You want to see me?

48:34.450 --> 48:37.160
Miss Minnie Littlejohn
say, "Where are you?"

48:37.244 --> 48:39.204
Oh.

48:39.246 --> 48:41.540
Where I am, huh?
Yes, sir.

48:41.623 --> 48:45.670
She say if you're not there
in half an hour, the place'll
be triple locked against you.

48:45.753 --> 48:48.506
Triple locked, huh?

48:48.548 --> 48:51.884
You tell Miss Minnie Littlejohn
I'll be there...

48:51.968 --> 48:53.886
when I'm there.

48:53.970 --> 48:55.972
I'll tell her.

48:57.223 --> 49:00.560
It appears I have a late date.

49:01.853 --> 49:04.771
Are you married?
You got a woman somewhere?

49:04.855 --> 49:07.482
I live single.

49:07.566 --> 49:09.526
Hmm.

49:09.609 --> 49:11.569
You've known a few though, huh?

49:12.862 --> 49:15.030
Yeah. My fair share.

49:15.114 --> 49:17.116
Deal.

49:59.075 --> 50:03.078
Well, your friend left early,
without even firing a shot.

50:03.161 --> 50:05.497
I was kissed good night,
Mr. Quick.

50:05.580 --> 50:08.500
Kissed and left. That'd been me,
I'd have stayed till sunup.

50:08.583 --> 50:10.502
Aren't you reckless.
Aren't you?

50:10.585 --> 50:13.505
No, I'm just skittish, Mr. Quick.
Just plain skittish.

50:13.588 --> 50:15.508
I have an answer for that.

50:15.591 --> 50:19.221
Let's go get in that old Lincoln car
of yours and go plow up the countryside.

50:19.304 --> 50:21.679
Let's go holler off a bridge
good and loud.

50:21.763 --> 50:25.892
There's been enough commotion tonight.
You want quiet?

50:25.975 --> 50:28.353
Let's go find us
a needle in a haystack.

50:28.436 --> 50:30.855
Mr. Quick, those are all
lovely, colorful suggestions...

50:30.939 --> 50:33.441
but I'm afraid if I
started out to follow you...

50:33.483 --> 50:36.236
I would hear the starch
in my petticoat begin to rustle...

50:36.319 --> 50:38.237
and I'd know
I was out of character.

50:38.320 --> 50:40.656
Get out of character, lady.
Come on. Get way out.

50:40.739 --> 50:42.742
Sudden changes
are not in my line.

50:42.826 --> 50:44.744
You'll never know till you try.

50:44.828 --> 50:48.372
There's a volume ofJane Austen
upstairs by my bed...

50:48.455 --> 50:50.834
and a glass of hot milk
that's getting cold.

50:50.875 --> 50:53.837
You mean your friend would not like it
if we went off together.

50:53.878 --> 50:56.547
The idea of you and me
just wouldn't go down, would it?

50:56.630 --> 50:59.590
I don't wish to discuss him with you.
Why not? I respect him.

50:59.674 --> 51:03.011
I admire his manners
and I admire the speeches he makes.

51:03.095 --> 51:05.723
And I admire
the big house he lives in.

51:05.806 --> 51:08.475
But if you're savin' it
all for him, honey...

51:08.559 --> 51:11.811
you've got your account
in the wrong bank.

51:11.853 --> 51:15.482
You can leave any time now!

51:15.524 --> 51:17.860
Don't ask me twice.

51:27.035 --> 51:34.875
Sister?

51:34.916 --> 51:37.129
Oh, you are out here.
Alone, huh?

51:38.421 --> 51:40.798
When did Alan leave?

51:40.882 --> 51:43.509
About 10:00.
Early.

51:43.593 --> 51:45.553
Well, he's been ill.

51:45.595 --> 51:49.182
Yeah? You look
a little pale yourself.

51:49.265 --> 51:51.768
Well, it's hot.
I haven't been sleeping very well.

51:51.851 --> 51:53.853
How old are you, sister?

51:53.936 --> 51:55.897
Don't you know?

51:55.980 --> 51:58.398
I keep a lot of figures
in my head.

51:58.440 --> 52:00.401
Well, add these.
I'm 23.

52:00.443 --> 52:02.737
Huh.

52:02.779 --> 52:07.075
Your mama was 18 when I married her.
Just turned.

52:07.116 --> 52:10.203
Papa, are we gonna talk
about that again?
We are.

52:11.788 --> 52:14.332
You know, you never look at me.

52:14.415 --> 52:18.168
My life comes and goes,
my birthdays come and go.

52:18.251 --> 52:21.336
Do you know I'm really quite a lively,
intelligent girl?

52:21.419 --> 52:23.839
Sometimes I even
make people laugh.

52:23.923 --> 52:26.967
Yet you and I never seem to have
any other conversation but this one.

52:27.051 --> 52:30.304
You're unmarried.
You have pointed that out before.

52:30.388 --> 52:33.558
What do you do out here,
you and Alan, huh?

52:34.811 --> 52:38.772
We talk.
What gets said? Anything important?

52:38.855 --> 52:43.109
He thinks I'm a nice, quiet,
self-contained girl.

52:43.234 --> 52:47.531
Well, that ain't
damn near enough!

52:47.614 --> 52:51.493
Thousands of acres out there, millions
of seeds put down in the ground.

52:51.576 --> 52:54.246
Every year
the seeds come up again.

52:54.328 --> 52:57.372
Life goes on.

52:57.455 --> 52:59.750
Where's "my" crop, huh?

52:59.792 --> 53:01.794
What follows me?

53:01.836 --> 53:04.046
What happens when I'm dead?

53:04.130 --> 53:07.549
You'll probably have the biggest funeral
in the state of Mississippi.

53:07.632 --> 53:10.761
That don't scare me, so long as
there's plenty of Varners to mourn me.

53:10.845 --> 53:12.804
Jody and I will be there.

53:12.846 --> 53:15.807
You and Jody, and Jody's kids,
and yours, and their kids!

53:15.890 --> 53:17.809
My descendants, sister.
A line.

53:17.892 --> 53:21.564
A long line with my face stamped on 'em,
my blood flowing in their veins.

53:21.647 --> 53:24.692
All of that from the two of us?

53:24.775 --> 53:27.446
You think I'm joking.

53:28.572 --> 53:31.614
You listen here to me, sister.

53:31.698 --> 53:34.743
If your blood is so frail
and so delicate...

53:34.826 --> 53:37.829
that it just calls out
for Alan Stewart...

53:37.912 --> 53:40.331
amen, let it be him.

53:40.373 --> 53:43.585
I'll give you a big weddin'.
I'll build a house for you.

53:43.668 --> 53:47.047
I'll put money in Alan's account
atJefferson First Trust Bank.

53:47.129 --> 53:49.631
But it's gonna be "now," missy!

53:49.715 --> 53:52.176
No more pussyfootin',
no more holdin' hands...

53:52.259 --> 53:55.513
and squeakin' that front porch swing
back and forth.

53:55.597 --> 53:58.058
Six years that's all I've heard
is squeakin'.

53:58.141 --> 54:02.062
Well, you can go and tell his mama...
to let go.

54:02.145 --> 54:05.857
You tell her you're taking over
'cause your daddy said so.

54:05.940 --> 54:09.986
If you should get "no" for an answer,
let me tell you, sister...

54:10.028 --> 54:12.154
it's gonna be that other.

54:12.237 --> 54:14.198
Which other?

54:14.239 --> 54:17.408
That prize
blue-ribbon bull...

54:17.492 --> 54:21.580
that hand-grown, handpicked,
hand-selected-by-me fellow
name of Quick.

54:21.663 --> 54:23.749
You can't mean "him."
Can't I?

54:23.832 --> 54:26.668
Listen, I'm gonna get me
some men in the Varner family.

54:26.710 --> 54:28.754
Some good, strong,
strapping men.

54:28.837 --> 54:30.839
Varners!
That's what I want. Varners.

54:30.923 --> 54:33.008
And more Varners.
And more Varners still.

54:33.050 --> 54:35.511
Enough Varners
to infest the countryside.

54:35.552 --> 54:38.013
I'm gonna see that happen,
sister, before I die.

54:38.055 --> 54:40.347
I'm gonna accomplish that.
Yes, ma'am.

54:40.389 --> 54:45.103
By means of that Quick,
that big stud horse.

54:45.186 --> 54:47.731
You mean you'd sell me away
like that?

54:47.815 --> 54:49.732
I'm not sellin' you.
Yes, sell me!

54:49.816 --> 54:53.237
Without caring what I feel
or what I think or what I am!

54:53.278 --> 54:56.989
I'm trying to save you.
Is that what you call it?

54:57.073 --> 54:59.700
Sister...

54:59.742 --> 55:02.744
you're gonna
give me grandsons...

55:04.037 --> 55:06.999
by way of Alan...

55:07.083 --> 55:09.460
or Quick.

55:09.544 --> 55:13.422
But you're gonna do it,
Clara Ann Varner. Hear me now.

55:14.757 --> 55:17.677
You'll get that ring
on your finger.

55:23.266 --> 55:25.267
890
00:55:51,292... > 00:55:53,253
Here comes Jody.

55:54.296 --> 55:56.416
892
00:55:59,051... > 00:56:01,011
What's goin' on?
Huh?

56:01.094 --> 56:03.221
They ain't come
to do much buyin'.

56:03.305 --> 56:06.431
Penny worth of candy,
two cents worth of nails, maybe.

56:06.514 --> 56:08.726
Oh, they just come to look.

56:08.809 --> 56:10.728
What at?

56:10.810 --> 56:12.896
We ain't runnin' no sideshow.

56:12.979 --> 56:15.441
They come to look
at the new man.

56:15.483 --> 56:18.194
Three days ago,
never even knew his name.

56:18.277 --> 56:21.113
But from now on, they're gonna
have to be dealing with him...

56:21.155 --> 56:23.115
for all the necessaries
of livin'.

56:23.157 --> 56:26.494
Oh, no. They're gonna
deal with me...

56:26.577 --> 56:28.579
like always.

56:34.626 --> 56:36.629
Good morning, Jody.

56:40.925 --> 56:43.803
Mr. Jody?

56:43.844 --> 56:45.970
Mr. Jody.

56:46.054 --> 56:49.891
My little chaps at home
never even had shoes last winter.

56:51.142 --> 56:53.812
We ain't got corn
to feed the stock.

56:53.853 --> 56:57.730
Them $30 my husband paid
for that horse yesterday...

56:57.814 --> 57:00.817
which he ain't even seen
since then...

57:00.900 --> 57:03.363
I earned myself...

57:03.446 --> 57:06.324
sewing at night
and baking cakes.

57:06.366 --> 57:11.914
If that ain't the limit.
You get greased and fleeced,
and then you lay it at my door?

57:11.997 --> 57:14.499
The trouble is
we got an outsider here!

57:17.419 --> 57:20.921
He don't know nothin', and he don't care
nothin' about you and your worries.

57:21.004 --> 57:22.922
No, sir.

57:23.005 --> 57:25.718
He don't care about anything
except advancin' himself.

57:27.678 --> 57:30.557
Lot of harsh things
being said about me.

57:30.640 --> 57:34.059
And if I was to answer
each and every one of'em...

57:34.101 --> 57:36.687
why, that'd take up
too much of your time.

57:36.770 --> 57:40.232
All I can say, missus, is you took
your complaint to the wrong department.

57:40.315 --> 57:44.360
Now, we're under new management.
You got a $30 problem?

57:44.402 --> 57:46.821
924
00:57:49,907... > 00:57:51,909
It's solved.

57:57.792 --> 58:00.128
Goodwill. Ain't nothin'
in the world like it.

58:01.795 --> 58:04.923
You think you got
a cozy nest here, don't ya?

58:05.007 --> 58:07.340
Well, you ain't gonna
take over from me, boy!

58:07.424 --> 58:11.054
" "" Off with the old,"
on with the new.

58:11.137 --> 58:13.473
Same old store, same stand.

58:13.556 --> 58:17.268
"All we got is a new broom. Mornin'."
" Hi, Will."

58:17.351 --> 58:20.772
You can't teach an old dog
new tricks. Mornin'.

58:20.855 --> 58:24.233
But you sure can teach a young
willin' puppy just about anything.

58:24.275 --> 58:27.236
Ben Quick, fetch me a Coke!

58:27.278 --> 58:31.281
Give him time. A penny on the waters
pays interest when the flood turns.

58:31.364 --> 58:34.644
936
00:58:37,205... > 00:58:40,083
Thank you for your encouragement
and kind support.

58:45.504 --> 58:50.592
938
00:58:50,675... > 00:58:53,220
Jody, aren't you ever
goin' to work again?

58:53.303 --> 58:55.555
You always gonna be
hangin' round?

58:55.639 --> 59:00.018
I can't do my nails or fix my hair
without havin' you hangin' round.

59:00.102 --> 59:02.104
Now, you take that Ben Quick.

59:02.145 --> 59:04.898
He's down at that store
workin', sweatin'.

59:04.981 --> 59:06.900
He's where you ought to be.

59:06.983 --> 59:09.111
Who are you to tell me to work?

59:09.194 --> 59:11.947
You ain't never outta a chair.

59:12.030 --> 59:14.199
Only time I seen you break cover...

59:14.282 --> 59:19.035
is when they're sweepin', cleanin' the
house, callin' you to the dinner table.

59:19.119 --> 59:22.039
Now, you got no call
to be insultin'.

59:22.123 --> 59:25.167
As your wife, I just don't wanna see you
get passed by that boy.

59:25.251 --> 59:28.463
951
00:59:30,549... > 00:59:32,508

59:33.968 --> 59:35.970
Now, Jody.
Come on.

59:36.053 --> 59:38.305
No, Jody.
Come on.

59:38.389 --> 59:42.016
I'm gonna... I'm gonna busy myself
elsewheres, that's what I'm gonna do.

59:42.100 --> 59:44.812
I'm gonna remove myself.
I know what I'll do.

59:44.854 --> 59:46.857
I'll get me an education.
Come on.

59:46.940 --> 59:50.985
Clara's been after me
for months and months,
sayin' it's never too late to learn.

59:51.068 --> 59:53.946
No, Jody. No!

59:54.029 --> 59:57.490
I sure do wish you'd find yourself
some other form of recreation.

59:57.574 --> 01:00:01.827
961
01:00:26,060... > 01:00:28,020

01:01:02.179 --> 01:01:06.225
963
01:01:15,149... > 01:01:18,111
Well, it's a little late
to be keepin' store, isn't it?

01:01:18.152 --> 01:01:21.489
No, I'm just, uh, movin' these
cotton dresses down in front...

01:01:21.572 --> 01:01:23.783
so the ladies can see 'em
when they first come in.

01:01:23.866 --> 01:01:25.785
You seem to know
a lot about women.

01:01:25.868 --> 01:01:28.371
Well, I know what makes 'em
spend their money.

01:01:30.039 --> 01:01:33.625
You come in to buy somethin',
Miss Clara, or you just shoppin' around?

01:01:33.709 --> 01:01:36.753
I was just passin'.

01:01:36.795 --> 01:01:39.965
Well, it's a warm night. I've been
drinkin' some beer. You want some?

01:01:40.048 --> 01:01:43.262
No, thank you.
You got a sweet tooth?

01:01:43.303 --> 01:01:47.224
I can offer you, uh, rock candy
and licorice whips.

01:01:47.307 --> 01:01:50.018
Jawbreakers.
Do a big business in jawbreakers.

01:01:51.685 --> 01:01:53.687
Outgrew 'em, huh?

01:01:58.232 --> 01:02:00.943
Well...
sunbonnets?

01:02:02.195 --> 01:02:05.241
Or hand lotion?
Lilac water? Freckle remover?

01:02:06.701 --> 01:02:08.744
Spotted dimity?

01:02:10.912 --> 01:02:13.040
Just can't sell you, can I?

01:02:14.416 --> 01:02:17.044
Well, do you have an aspirin?
I have a headache.

01:02:17.127 --> 01:02:19.421
Oh, sure.

01:02:19.504 --> 01:02:23.007
We got all kinds
of nostrums and remedies.

01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:26.217
'Course, I don't
have headaches myself.

01:02:26.301 --> 01:02:30.390
'Cause I don't have any problems.
Or scruples.

01:02:31.892 --> 01:02:33.852
Nope, not those either.

01:02:33.935 --> 01:02:36.646
Well, I have both.

01:02:40.692 --> 01:02:42.902
You got a thin skin
is what you got.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.780
But the world belongs
to the meat eaters, Miss Clara...

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:49.991
and if you have to take it raw,
take it raw.

01:02:51.702 --> 01:02:53.996
I couldn't live that way.

01:02:55.373 --> 01:02:58.585
Well, let's just examine
the way you do live, Miss Clara.

01:02:58.668 --> 01:03:02.630
You drive around in that old Lincoln
car of yours like it had wings...

01:03:02.713 --> 01:03:05.674
and you teach school, and, uh...

01:03:05.758 --> 01:03:10.219
you sit on your front porch with your
skinny little friend drinkin' lemonade.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.888
Now, what is all that,
when you see the rest of the world...

01:03:12.971 --> 01:03:14.975
passing you by paired up?

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.561
You're, what, 23?

01:03:18.645 --> 01:03:21.356
Yeah, thems are golden years...

01:03:21.439 --> 01:03:23.943
and you're bein' asked
to play a waitin' game.

01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:27.029
Why wait?

01:03:31.032 --> 01:03:33.034
Aw, school is out, Miss Clara.

01:03:34.868 --> 01:03:37.163
Them blinds are drawn,
night's fallen.

01:03:38.373 --> 01:03:40.667
Nobody here to see
if you make a mistake.

01:03:43.628 --> 01:03:46.714
You put them things down,
Miss Clara, 'cause I'm gonna kiss you.

01:03:48.048 --> 01:03:50.927
I'm gonna show you
how simple it is.

01:03:50.969 --> 01:03:53.052
You please me,
and I'll please you.

01:03:56.639 --> 01:03:59.308
Oh, I know what's troublin' you.

01:03:59.392 --> 01:04:03.106
It's all those boys
hollerin' for Eula every night.

01:04:03.189 --> 01:04:06.317
And Eula with her hair
hangin' down...

01:04:06.401 --> 01:04:09.903
and Jody with his shirt off,
chasin' her.

01:04:09.945 --> 01:04:12.406
And your old man at 60...

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:14.700
and he's callin' on
his lady love.

01:04:41.475 --> 01:04:44.101
All right. You proved it.
I'm human.

01:04:44.186 --> 01:04:46.647
Yes, ma'am,
you're human all right.

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:52.988
Barn burner!

01:04:58.327 --> 01:05:01.411
Well, you hit on it.

01:05:01.495 --> 01:05:04.955
I can see my white shirt
and black tie and Sunday manners...

01:05:04.997 --> 01:05:07.416
didn't fool you for a minute.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:11.046
Well, that's right, ma'am.
I'm a menace to the countryside.

01:05:11.129 --> 01:05:16.052
All a man's gotta do is just look at me
sideways, and his house goes up in fire.

01:05:16.135 --> 01:05:20.138
And here I am, livin' right here in the
middle of your peaceable little town.

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:22.808
Right in your backyard,
you might say.

01:05:22.891 --> 01:05:26.018
Guess that oughta
keep you awake at night.

01:05:40.033 --> 01:05:44.663
"" Anything you break,
you gotta pay for. Heh.

01:05:44.705 --> 01:05:47.082
What are you doin' here?
Takin' the air.

01:05:47.165 --> 01:05:50.918
You hired me to tend your store.
Now, I'm tendin' it.
That don't need no supervision.

01:05:51.001 --> 01:05:53.461
You and my daughter
had some words, huh?

01:05:53.545 --> 01:05:56.464
Yeah, a few.
She don't cotton to you much,
does she?

01:05:56.548 --> 01:06:02.138
Ain't no love lost.
That don't need to slow you down none.

01:06:02.221 --> 01:06:04.682
I put you forth as a candidate.

01:06:04.765 --> 01:06:08.687
Oh, yeah? And just what office
you got me runnin' for?

01:06:08.729 --> 01:06:12.856
I opened a lot of doors for you,
Ben Quick. Ever ask yourself why?

01:06:12.897 --> 01:06:16.026
Am I a senile old man?

01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:18.570
Am I a sentimental old fool?

01:06:19.905 --> 01:06:22.950
I am not.
So?

01:06:23.034 --> 01:06:25.536
I'm a man with a purpose.

01:06:25.578 --> 01:06:28.204
Well, we all got
some mission in life.

01:06:28.246 --> 01:06:31.041
Care to hear yours?

01:06:32.751 --> 01:06:35.086
Just what do you think
you'd like me to do...

01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:37.088
if you was able
to make me do it?

01:06:37.172 --> 01:06:39.257
Get married.

01:06:40.467 --> 01:06:42.927
Have sons.

01:06:44.846 --> 01:06:47.974
Well, I'll be damned.
More than probable you will be...

01:06:48.058 --> 01:06:51.061
but first you're goin' to church
and get married, ya hear?

01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:54.689
To my daughter.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.620
That's the one you
didn't figure, ain't it?

01:07:09.954 --> 01:07:12.540
Yeah, that's the one.

01:07:12.624 --> 01:07:14.584
Well?

01:07:16.294 --> 01:07:18.295
What about it?

01:07:19.505 --> 01:07:21.464
Well, I'd say it's
a mighty interestin' notion.

01:07:21.547 --> 01:07:23.800
"Notion"? Notion?

01:07:23.883 --> 01:07:27.262
I'm talkin' about the survival
of my family name.

01:07:27.304 --> 01:07:30.558
I'm talkin' about the establishment
of my immortality.

01:07:31.935 --> 01:07:34.104
You, you wanna put down roots?

01:07:34.145 --> 01:07:38.147
Move to my house. Live with us.
Sleep under clean sheets.

01:07:38.231 --> 01:07:40.441
Study that skinny gal.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.821
Well, now, what's in it for me?

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:49.575
Well, there's lands
and moneys...

01:07:49.659 --> 01:07:51.703
on the day of the weddin'.

01:07:52.911 --> 01:07:55.833
More to come.
What lands...

01:07:55.916 --> 01:07:58.502
what moneys, and how much more?

01:07:58.585 --> 01:08:02.506
We'll have a meetin' with my banker
and my lawyer. You'll see for yourself.

01:08:02.548 --> 01:08:05.634
I'll take that old Frenchman's ruin
for a starter.

01:08:05.676 --> 01:08:10.387
Well.
Yeah. Right now. Tonight.

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:14.390
I'll give it to you in writin'.
Yeah, you do that.

01:08:14.473 --> 01:08:17.894
Who says I picked the wrong man?

01:08:17.978 --> 01:08:20.522
You and me
got a deal, Ben Quick.

01:08:20.604 --> 01:08:23.443
And who says marriages
are made in heaven?

01:08:23.526 --> 01:08:25.737
All of hell wouldn't
have this one!

01:08:25.819 --> 01:08:27.738
Now, make no mistake
about that gal.

01:08:27.821 --> 01:08:32.241
She's, uh, delicate, but in other ways
she's smart, like her mother before her.

01:08:32.323 --> 01:08:35.578
She has quality. Quality.

01:08:37.038 --> 01:08:39.667
It's as close as you and me
will ever get to it.

01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:46.506
1074
01:08:52,512... > 01:08:54,513

01:08:55.805 --> 01:08:58.225
Move right in, boy. It's all yours.

01:08:58.309 --> 01:09:00.353
I'm movin' up in the world.

01:09:15.408 --> 01:09:17.536
Miss Clara's room is in
the back of the house.

01:09:19.412 --> 01:09:21.874
Mr. Jody
and Miss Eula.

01:09:21.916 --> 01:09:25.044
And here's your room.
And the old man?

01:09:25.086 --> 01:09:27.756
Never know where he is.
Don't sleep so good no more.

01:09:27.839 --> 01:09:31.175
Just roves around from room to room,
sometimes three in a night.

01:09:41.725 --> 01:09:44.604
1083
01:09:44,646... > 01:09:48,858
I had five sisters
and a brother...

01:09:48.942 --> 01:09:51.237
and a mother and a father
and an old maid aunt.

01:09:52.613 --> 01:09:55.573
And all together,
we slept in a room about...

01:09:55.615 --> 01:09:57.617
half this size.

01:09:57.659 --> 01:09:59.911
Same as my family.

01:09:59.953 --> 01:10:01.912
And look at us now, Lucius.

01:10:01.954 --> 01:10:05.332
Big rooms, small rooms...
all the same size to the Lord.

01:10:05.416 --> 01:10:07.419
Bathroom's end of the hall.

01:10:36.947 --> 01:10:39.367
Well, just so we don't
crowd each other...

01:10:39.451 --> 01:10:41.578
I shave nights
and shower mornings.

01:11:18.196 --> 01:11:21.073
You bringin' him here?
Into the house?

01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:23.493
Big house.
Room for one more.

01:11:23.534 --> 01:11:26.661
But he don't belong here.
He's hired help.

01:11:27.913 --> 01:11:31.834
He's more than that.
How much more than that?

01:11:31.876 --> 01:11:34.920
Well, he's gonna be
kind of brotherly, Jody.

01:11:35.003 --> 01:11:37.839
I brought you home a big brother.

01:11:37.881 --> 01:11:40.092
So look out for him.
Boy's clever.

01:11:40.175 --> 01:11:43.053
He'll be up when you're sleepin',
and he's gonna be where you ain't.

01:11:43.095 --> 01:11:48.226
Look alive, Jody. You're a couple
of racehorses startin' out even.

01:11:48.309 --> 01:11:51.521
Well, we'll see who is the fastest
and who is the smartest.

01:11:51.562 --> 01:11:55.482
It's not exactly even,
considerin' I'm your blood son!

01:11:55.565 --> 01:11:58.651
Don't open that can of beans.
Well, I am openin' it!

01:12:00.737 --> 01:12:03.614
Well, then eat what you got.

01:12:03.698 --> 01:12:05.658
Exactly nothin'.

01:12:15.084 --> 01:12:17.253
Am I your son...

01:12:17.336 --> 01:12:19.380
or ain't I your son?

01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:23.592
You was born to me.

01:12:23.634 --> 01:12:26.888
Ain't you got any affection for me...
or regard for me?

01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:30.516
Just tell me that.
You're just tryin' to
make yourself miserable.

01:12:30.599 --> 01:12:34.104
"Miserable"? Seems like I walked
around in misery all my life.

01:12:34.187 --> 01:12:36.940
You ain't never been a papa.

01:12:37.024 --> 01:12:40.402
No! 'Cept to tell me
to stand up straight.

01:12:40.444 --> 01:12:43.279
You push, reach,
stretch yourself.

01:12:43.362 --> 01:12:45.739
I put down a big footprint.

01:12:47.489 --> 01:12:51.452
I said,"Here.
Step in. Fill it."

01:12:52.578 --> 01:12:54.497
You never did.
Well, I tried.

01:12:54.581 --> 01:12:57.918
I tried to be what you wanted,
but I ain't got it in me.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.755
Where do ya go lookin' for it
if you ain't got it in you?

01:13:00.838 --> 01:13:03.339
You find a way, or you don't.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.135
Papa, please.

01:13:12.057 --> 01:13:14.851
You have Lucius dig you up
some worms, Jody.

01:13:18.396 --> 01:13:20.524
You go fishin', boy.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:05.400
Jody?

01:14:08.487 --> 01:14:11.365
Don't you lie there with your face
in the pillow, Jody Varner.

01:14:11.448 --> 01:14:13.658
That's exactly what
he expects you to be doing.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:19.831
Jody.
You had spunk once.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:22.709
Remember, you used to throw
brown paper bags full of water...

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:25.044
on his head
from this very window.

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.755
Remember? I'd fill 'em up,
and you'd throw 'em?

01:14:27.839 --> 01:14:30.299
You were only seven years old then,
and you were wonderful.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.385
You weren't afraid then.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.470
Jody?

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:38.056
Jody, you remember
John Wesley Pritchard?

01:14:38.098 --> 01:14:40.225
You remember how he stood out
in the school yard...

01:14:40.308 --> 01:14:43.062
and said,"Clara Varner
has front teeth like a horse,"

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:46.232
and I cried and said,"I'm gonna get
my big brotherJody Varner...

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.859
to punch you in the nose,"
and you did?

01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:53.364
Jody?

01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:57.660
I wouldn't have gotten
through my girlhood alive
if it hadn't been for you.

01:14:57.744 --> 01:14:59.662
All of which makes you
very dear to me...

01:14:59.746 --> 01:15:03.165
and I don't care what he did
or said to you downstairs.

01:15:12.257 --> 01:15:14.216
1145
01:15:27,021... > 01:15:29,023

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:49.627
You look mighty pretty
with them readin' glasses on.

01:15:52.587 --> 01:15:54.673
You look pretty with them off.

01:15:56.882 --> 01:15:58.884
You look mighty young there,
Miss Clara...

01:15:58.967 --> 01:16:00.886
all curled up in your bed...

01:16:00.969 --> 01:16:03.209
like you just washed your hands
and brushed your teeth...

01:16:03.223 --> 01:16:05.142
and said your prayers
like a little girl.

01:16:05.226 --> 01:16:08.396
I'll bet you was
a mighty appealin'little girl.

01:16:08.479 --> 01:16:11.190
I'll bet your hair hung
in a tangle down your back.

01:16:11.273 --> 01:16:15.318
I'll bet you knew where to look
for robins' eggs and blackberries.

01:16:17.112 --> 01:16:20.323
I'll bet you had
a doll with no head on it.

01:16:20.407 --> 01:16:22.909
There's a church bazaar
comin' up next week.

01:16:24.327 --> 01:16:26.747
Now, you wear a white dress
and a ribbon in your hair...

01:16:26.831 --> 01:16:29.125
and I'll waltz you
around under the moon.

01:16:35.087 --> 01:16:37.589
Clara?

01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:42.970
Clara.

01:16:45.347 --> 01:16:48.559
Clara

01:16:54.064 --> 01:16:57.109
" "Beautiful dreamer""

01:16:57.193 --> 01:17:00.613
Wake unto me

01:17:00.697 --> 01:17:06.160
Starlight and dewdrops
are waiting for thee

01:17:06.243 --> 01:17:08.578
Okay, folks,
"this is the old-fashioned"...

01:17:08.661 --> 01:17:12.041
Sounds of the rude world

01:17:12.124 --> 01:17:14.877
Heard in the day

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:18.756
Lulled by the moonlight

01:17:18.839 --> 01:17:23.216
Have all passed away

01:17:24.468 --> 01:17:28.514
Beautiful dreamer

01:17:28.598 --> 01:17:32.226
Queen of my song

01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:36.357
"List while I woo thee"""

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.735
Hi, Will.
Hi, Sam.

01:17:40.818 --> 01:17:43.821
1175
01:17:48,116... > 01:17:51,578

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:55.458
Come on over.
I'll give you a whole grocery
store for a dime over here.

01:17:59.337 --> 01:18:02.548
That Ben Quick,
he sure is a comer.

01:18:02.632 --> 01:18:05.718
Yep. Name suits him,
all right.

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.762
First into that farm,
then into the store...

01:18:08.804 --> 01:18:10.764
now in the house.

01:18:10.847 --> 01:18:13.600
And all he started with
was a book of matches.

01:18:13.684 --> 01:18:16.268
I wish I was Ben Quick.

01:18:16.352 --> 01:18:20.232
He's got this here whole state
of Mississippi to graze on.

01:18:20.273 --> 01:18:24.278
Yeah, but if you should happen to go out
to see him on business, go out naked.

01:18:24.362 --> 01:18:26.405
That way you won't feel
the cold comin' back.

01:18:26.488 --> 01:18:30.117
" "" It's ten cents"...

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.993
Hi, Jody.
Hi.

01:18:33.077 --> 01:18:35.913
Can I sell you somethin'?
Uh, yeah. Wedge of pie.

01:18:35.955 --> 01:18:37.915
Apple pie?
All right.

01:18:37.957 --> 01:18:40.001
Fifteen cents.

01:18:41.585 --> 01:18:43.546
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:18:48.344 --> 01:18:51.596
1193
01:18:53,472... > 01:18:55,099
Jody?

01:18:55.141 --> 01:18:57.435
You got a pencil, Will?
What for?

01:18:57.518 --> 01:18:59.603
I want you to write somethin' down.
What?

01:18:59.687 --> 01:19:02.064
September 30. That's the day.
What day?

01:19:02.148 --> 01:19:04.899
A six-layer vanilla cake
is comin' from Mayville...

01:19:04.983 --> 01:19:07.609
suitably decorated
in boiled white frostin'.

01:19:07.693 --> 01:19:11.531
A hundred and four handwritten
invitations have gone out.
No children under six years.

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:14.578
Women have got to take care
of themselves. That's what I done.

01:19:14.661 --> 01:19:17.830
What have you done, Minnie Littlejohn?
It's all arranged.

01:19:17.913 --> 01:19:20.666
All but the license and the blood
tests... and the weddin' rings.

01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:24.294
Weddin'? Minnie.

01:19:24.336 --> 01:19:28.048
You take that six-layer,
white boiled frostin' vanilla cake...

01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:30.050
and you cut it up
in 104 pieces...

01:19:30.133 --> 01:19:32.553
and you send it out
with your regrets.

01:19:32.636 --> 01:19:35.306
All right, Will.

01:19:35.348 --> 01:19:37.600
Well, now, Minnie, honey...

01:19:39.267 --> 01:19:41.269
how'd you like a...

01:19:42.394 --> 01:19:45.522
yellow Thunderbird
automobile, huh?

01:19:45.606 --> 01:19:48.400
No, thank you, Will.

01:19:48.484 --> 01:19:50.944
Well, how'd you like
a brand-new super sewin' machine...

01:19:51.028 --> 01:19:54.114
with all them fancy attachments?
No, thank you, Will.

01:20:01.206 --> 01:20:03.165
Well...

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.338
how'd you like a...
plain gold ring?

01:20:14.094 --> 01:20:16.428
Folks? Folks, can I
have your attention?

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:19.099
Y'all come on
and gather round, ya hear?

01:20:19.182 --> 01:20:22.267
'Cause this is the moment all you
young fellas have been waitin' for.

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:24.520
Each of these
young ladies here...

01:20:24.561 --> 01:20:26.604
has packed two boxed suppers...

01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:30.233
and the high bidder wins
not only the delicious vittles...

01:20:30.316 --> 01:20:32.401
but also the privilege
of eatin"em...

01:20:32.484 --> 01:20:34.987
with the fair young maiden
who prepared 'em...

01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:37.365
with her own
lily-white hands.

01:20:37.448 --> 01:20:42.788
Now, I'm gonna start this off
with the daughter of one
of our first citizens...

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.790
Miss Clara Varner!

01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:47.627
Hooray!

01:20:47.711 --> 01:20:51.462
All right now, folks. What am I offered
for Miss Clara Varner's boxed supper?

01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:53.506
Ten dollars.
Ten dollars is bid.

01:20:53.589 --> 01:20:55.550
Come on, folks.
Anybody gonna hike that sum?

01:20:55.591 --> 01:20:57.552
I'll make it 11.

01:20:57.593 --> 01:21:00.137
Well, now, Mr. Quick
is interested in competin'.

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:03.057
It's now eleven, folks.
Eleven dollars.

01:21:03.141 --> 01:21:05.728
"Any advance on $ 11?"
Twelve dollars.

01:21:05.811 --> 01:21:07.895
Thirteen.
Fourteen.

01:21:07.937 --> 01:21:10.231
Fifteen.
Fifteen dollars.

01:21:10.314 --> 01:21:12.566
Any advance on 15?
Do I hear 16 anywhere?

01:21:12.607 --> 01:21:14.901
You hear $16.

01:21:14.943 --> 01:21:17.571
Alan...
Okay.

01:21:17.612 --> 01:21:21.074
Mr. Stewart has bid $16.
Any advance on 16, folks?

01:21:21.158 --> 01:21:23.909
Fifty.

01:21:23.951 --> 01:21:27.789
Fifty dollars.
In a very fine cause.

01:21:27.873 --> 01:21:30.293
Mr. Quick bids $50.
You hear that, folks?

01:21:30.335 --> 01:21:32.296
Fifty dollars once.

01:21:32.338 --> 01:21:34.506
Fifty dollars twice.

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:37.924
Sold to Mr. Ben Quick
for $50.

01:21:40.677 --> 01:21:44.138
This is gonna be about the most
expensive chicken supper
you ever et, boy...

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:46.140
but worth every cent of it...

01:21:46.182 --> 01:21:49.185
considerin' the charmin' company
you're gonna be eatin' it in.

01:21:49.268 --> 01:21:53.774
I, uh... I hope you're gonna give him
dessert for that price, Clara?

01:21:53.857 --> 01:21:56.318
He'll get his just desserts,
all right.

01:21:58.195 --> 01:22:02.698
All right, folks. Now, I know
this young lady's a good cook...

01:22:02.782 --> 01:22:04.784
'cause I'm her daddy.

01:22:04.867 --> 01:22:07.745
What'll I get for drumsticks
and chocolate brownies?

01:22:07.828 --> 01:22:12.249
This all right?
Nope. I like my picnics in the woods.

01:22:12.333 --> 01:22:14.752
Two dollars.
Three dollars.

01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:45.991
Well, come on now.

01:22:46.032 --> 01:22:48.118
Either we eat it,
or the ants will.

01:22:51.371 --> 01:22:53.372
That was quite a gesture
you made back there.

01:22:53.455 --> 01:22:56.208
What do you expect to live on
for the rest of the month?

01:22:56.291 --> 01:22:58.794
I have prospects.

01:22:58.877 --> 01:23:02.465
Well, now.
Look what we have here.

01:23:03.718 --> 01:23:05.803
Uh, little fancy napkins.

01:23:08.095 --> 01:23:10.139
Little frosted cakes.

01:23:12.474 --> 01:23:15.060
And little dainty sandwiches
with the crusts cut off.

01:23:15.144 --> 01:23:17.479
You got a bigger appetite
than that, haven't you?

01:23:17.563 --> 01:23:20.608
Hogwash.
Well, well.

01:23:20.692 --> 01:23:22.610
You heard me.
I said, "Hogwash."

01:23:22.694 --> 01:23:24.904
That's strong language,
Miss Clara.

01:23:24.988 --> 01:23:27.449
You got some foolish ideas
about me, Mr. Quick.

01:23:27.532 --> 01:23:30.576
I am no tremblin' little rabbit full
of smolderin', unsatisfied desires.

01:23:30.659 --> 01:23:32.618
Is that so?
Yes, that's so.

01:23:32.702 --> 01:23:34.662
I'm a woman, full-grown,
very smart...

01:23:34.746 --> 01:23:36.706
and not at all bad to look at.
Amen.

01:23:36.748 --> 01:23:39.208
I expect to live at the top of my bent
with no help from you.

01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:41.252
You're a real fire-eater,
you are.

01:23:41.336 --> 01:23:43.253
You are barkin' up the wrong girl,
Mr. Quick...

01:23:43.337 --> 01:23:45.340
because it will never be you.

01:23:47.926 --> 01:23:50.305
Never say never.

01:23:50.388 --> 01:23:53.766
I don't know what arrangement
you think you have with my father...

01:23:53.849 --> 01:23:56.018
but you'll find you have
no bargain with me.

01:23:56.101 --> 01:23:58.687
Now, we gonna be married,
Miss Clara. Haven't you heard?

01:23:58.771 --> 01:24:00.730
You have been hoodwinked,
Mr. Quick.

01:24:00.813 --> 01:24:02.982
For once in your crafty life,
you have been had.

01:24:03.066 --> 01:24:06.986
You mean you're turnin' me down,
refusin' my hand and my heart?

01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:11.282
You're too much like my father to
suit me, and I'm an authority on him.

01:24:11.366 --> 01:24:14.662
He's a wonderful old man.
One wolf recognizes another.

01:24:14.745 --> 01:24:17.204
Tame us.
Make pets out of us. You could.
I'm not interested.

01:24:17.287 --> 01:24:19.289
I gave up on him
when I was nine...

01:24:19.373 --> 01:24:23.543
and I gave up on you the first time
I ever looked into those cold blue eyes.

01:24:23.627 --> 01:24:26.922
You got the color right.
I've got everything right, Mr. Quick.

01:24:27.005 --> 01:24:30.550
Well, I can see you don't like me,
but you're gonna have me.

01:24:30.634 --> 01:24:33.095
It's gonna be you and me.

01:24:33.136 --> 01:24:36.474
Not the longest day I live.
"Yes, sir."

01:24:36.557 --> 01:24:39.143
They're gonna say,"There goes
that poor old Clara Varner...

01:24:39.226 --> 01:24:42.188
"whose father married her off
to a dirt-scratchin', shiftless...

01:24:42.271 --> 01:24:44.315
no-good farmer
who just happened by."

01:24:44.399 --> 01:24:46.651
Well, let 'em talk.
I'll tell you one thing.

01:24:46.734 --> 01:24:48.986
You gonna wake up
in the mornin' smilin'.

01:24:49.069 --> 01:24:51.529
That's not enough.
Do you understand me?

01:24:51.612 --> 01:24:54.865
That is not nearly enough.

01:24:54.949 --> 01:24:59.162
Mr. Quick, I am a human being.
Do you know what that means?

01:24:59.246 --> 01:25:03.165
It means I set a price on myself,
a high, high price.

01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:06.168
You may be surprised
to know it...

01:25:06.252 --> 01:25:08.254
but I've got
quite a lot to give.

01:25:08.337 --> 01:25:11.465
I've got things I have been
savin' up my whole life...

01:25:11.507 --> 01:25:14.218
things like love
and understanding and...

01:25:14.301 --> 01:25:18.055
and jokes and good times
and good cooking.

01:25:18.139 --> 01:25:21.102
I'm prepared to be the queen
of Sheba for some lucky man...

01:25:21.185 --> 01:25:25.106
or at the very least, the best wife
that any man could hope for.

01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:27.230
Now, that's my human history...

01:25:27.313 --> 01:25:29.232
and it's not gonna be
bought and sold...

01:25:29.315 --> 01:25:32.819
and it's certainly not gonna be
given away to any passin' stranger.

01:25:32.902 --> 01:25:36.699
All right. Then run, lady.
And you keep on runnin'!

01:25:36.782 --> 01:25:38.743
Buy yourself a bus ticket
and disappear.

01:25:38.826 --> 01:25:41.078
Change your name,
dye your hair, get lost!

01:25:41.162 --> 01:25:45.082
And then maybe... just maybe...
you're gonna be safe from me.

01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:47.418
Clara?

01:25:47.501 --> 01:25:51.296
You, uh, finished here, Clara?

01:25:51.379 --> 01:25:53.882
Yes. Thank you, Alan.
Well, now, I'll walk you back.

01:25:54.966 --> 01:25:57.177
With your permission,
Mr. Quick.

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:15.362
Do I look very flustered?
Nope.

01:26:16.529 --> 01:26:19.490
Well, I am.
Alan, let's stop a minute.

01:26:23.369 --> 01:26:25.412
Well, uh, what's wrong, Clara?

01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.667
Wanna tell me?

01:26:30.753 --> 01:26:34.423
Alan, this is the hardest thing
I ever had to do in my life.

01:26:34.506 --> 01:26:37.716
Well, tell me about it, and we'll
see if we can make it easier.

01:26:39.677 --> 01:26:45.223
Alan, I have told people you love me,
and I have told myself you love me.

01:26:45.264 --> 01:26:48.267
Now, I've done this
for five years...

01:26:48.351 --> 01:26:50.812
but I have never
heard you say it.

01:26:52.021 --> 01:26:54.441
And now I've gotta know.

01:26:54.525 --> 01:26:59.113
Well, I guess I'd better say it then,
Clara. I do love you.

01:26:59.196 --> 01:27:03.242
But do you want me
the way a man wants a woman?

01:27:03.325 --> 01:27:06.245
What I want
is to help you, Clara.

01:27:06.286 --> 01:27:10.748
But, Alan, that's such
a pitiful answer.

01:27:12.041 --> 01:27:15.586
That's such a good,
kind, pitiful answer.

01:27:15.670 --> 01:27:18.674
It's the only kind of answer
I can make you, Clara.

01:27:20.467 --> 01:27:22.969
I didn't mean to waste
your young years like this...

01:27:23.052 --> 01:27:27.222
but... you're so sweet,
so graceful, so intelligent...

01:27:27.305 --> 01:27:29.266
and you never made any demands.

01:27:29.349 --> 01:27:31.393
Well, I wanted to.

01:27:33.311 --> 01:27:36.565
Oh, I came very close
a couple of times.

01:27:36.648 --> 01:27:41.447
There were all sorts of feminine wiles
I was gonna try out on you.

01:27:41.488 --> 01:27:44.614
'Course, I don't guess
it would've done me any good.

01:27:44.698 --> 01:27:46.867
Your mama has
a long head start on me...

01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:49.871
and I don't think anybody's
gonna overtake her.

01:27:52.915 --> 01:27:55.501
How... awful
that must have been for you.

01:27:57.295 --> 01:28:01.255
All those Friday evenings
with my dreadful father
snippin' at your heels...

01:28:01.339 --> 01:28:04.885
and me moonin'
and dreamin' over you.

01:28:04.968 --> 01:28:06.928
Must've been very embarrassin'.

01:28:11.974 --> 01:28:15.811
I'm so ashamed.
I'm so...

01:28:21.776 --> 01:28:24.896
1353
01:28:24,363... > 01:28:26,740
What are you doin'?
You lookin' for me, Jody?

01:28:26.824 --> 01:28:30.285
I'm lookin' for ya.
I found ya.

01:28:31.745 --> 01:28:34.331
Well, all right now.
We got that much clear. What next?

01:28:34.414 --> 01:28:36.666
From the minute
you strayed in here...

01:28:36.707 --> 01:28:38.708
everything's gone wrong
in my life.

01:28:38.792 --> 01:28:40.794
I been cut down to nothin'.

01:28:40.877 --> 01:28:43.296
I lost me my store,
my wife's respect...

01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:48.135
and my old man,
he hates me, worse than ever.

01:28:48.219 --> 01:28:51.139
All that's over now, boy. They're gonna
find you downstream tomorrow.

01:28:51.223 --> 01:28:54.557
And I'm gonna have my place
back in the world. Do you hear me?

01:28:54.641 --> 01:28:57.560
Oh, Jody, you aimin' to kill me?

01:28:57.602 --> 01:29:01.564
Yeah, that's right.
What, do you think I'm jokin'? Huh?

01:29:03.984 --> 01:29:06.152
Now, w-wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Jody.

01:29:07.237 --> 01:29:09.781
Now, I'll tell you what I'll do.

01:29:09.864 --> 01:29:13.912
I'll make it up to you.
Yeah, I'll pay you back for everything
you think I've taken.

01:29:13.996 --> 01:29:16.287
I don't wanna hear about it!

01:29:16.371 --> 01:29:18.957
Now, wait a minute.
Now, look at that, Jody.

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.546
Yeah? So you got
five dollars.

01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:28.382
Who cares, boy?
No, sir. Not no ordinary five dollars.

01:29:28.424 --> 01:29:31.385
Now, this ain't wages, Jody.
It ain't spendin' money.

01:29:31.427 --> 01:29:33.512
Jody, this is treasure.

01:29:34.930 --> 01:29:38.352
From where?
From right outta my front lawn.

01:29:39.436 --> 01:29:41.396
You kiddin' me? Huh?
No, sir.

01:29:41.438 --> 01:29:43.523
That old Frenchman's place
your daddy give me?

01:29:45.274 --> 01:29:47.776
Hey, look, boy.
That's nothin' but a heap o' bricks.

01:29:47.818 --> 01:29:50.738
An old haunted house now.
That's what it appears to be.

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:53.823
Now look, boy.

01:29:55.367 --> 01:29:57.369
I ain't the kind
to be taken in...

01:29:57.453 --> 01:29:59.413
by a bunch of hokey stories...

01:29:59.455 --> 01:30:02.457
old men tell while they sit around
the shed spittin' tobacco juice.

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:04.792
Jody, I'll tell you,
I felt the same way too.

01:30:04.876 --> 01:30:06.920
That is till idle curiosity...

01:30:07.004 --> 01:30:10.424
led me to do a little pokin' around,
and I'll tell ya...

01:30:10.466 --> 01:30:14.094
when this turned up,
I was struck dumb.

01:30:14.136 --> 01:30:18.766
But there it is, Jody, just like people
have said it was for a hundred years.

01:30:25.314 --> 01:30:27.523
Boy, you-you-you...
you tryin' to gull me?

01:30:27.607 --> 01:30:29.692
Jody, you just put
your mind at ease.

01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:33.863
Look, I know better than
to try to trade you blind...

01:30:33.946 --> 01:30:36.490
especially when it's my life
I'm dickerin' for.

01:30:36.573 --> 01:30:38.700
It's your life, all right.

01:30:39.785 --> 01:30:42.246
Show me.

01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:44.332
Come on.

01:31:07.605 --> 01:31:09.805
1396
01:31:36,174... > 01:31:38,427
You and
your treasure.

01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:41.680
We've been workin' an hour.
Now, where is it?

01:31:41.763 --> 01:31:44.516
Huh?
Well, you never can tell.

01:31:47.893 --> 01:31:49.978
It might be in
the next shovel load.

01:32:17.089 --> 01:32:19.383
1401
01:32:19,467... > 01:32:21,635

01:32:21.719 --> 01:32:24.263
We got it!

01:32:27.849 --> 01:32:29.893
Yeah.

01:32:29.976 --> 01:32:31.936
1405
01:32:32,020... > 01:32:34,105
I got it, Pa!

01:32:40.944 --> 01:32:45.449
1407
01:32:49,287... > 01:32:51,748" """

01:32:59.881 --> 01:33:02.425
Jody. What are you
doin'out here?

01:33:04.719 --> 01:33:07.763
Have you gone out of your mind, boy?
Get away from me.

01:33:07.846 --> 01:33:11.975
Your wife's gettin'
kind of anxious about you, boy.

01:33:14.811 --> 01:33:17.648
Get outta that hole.
Come on home with me.

01:33:17.731 --> 01:33:20.192
I said get away from me.

01:33:20.275 --> 01:33:22.611
Jody, I ain't goin' without ya.

01:33:22.653 --> 01:33:24.780
1416
01:33:29,242... > 01:33:31,953
Go on. Go on.

01:33:31.995 --> 01:33:34.622
You keep on thinkin' I'm crazy.

01:33:34.706 --> 01:33:36.666
I'm about as crazy as a fox.

01:33:36.708 --> 01:33:39.210
I'm out from under
your thumb, Papa.

01:33:39.293 --> 01:33:41.462
I paid that Ben Quick
friend of yours...

01:33:41.546 --> 01:33:44.174
one thousand dollars
for the rights to this land...

01:33:44.258 --> 01:33:46.300
and everything
I find here is mine!

01:33:46.384 --> 01:33:50.504
1424
01:33:48,386... > 01:33:52,975
Who knows? I may be openin'a store
right across the street from yours.

01:33:53.017 --> 01:33:55.601
"Who knows?"
Boy...

01:33:55.685 --> 01:33:58.146
just what you think
you're gonna find out here?

01:34:03.775 --> 01:34:06.653
More of that.
"Buckets" of that.

01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:14.287
Yeah, bite on it.
It's real, all right.

01:34:17.915 --> 01:34:21.917
Is this the money that the folks hid
when they thought Grant was comin'?

01:34:25.963 --> 01:34:29.384
Is this the money that's supposed
to have been layin' out here
all these years...

01:34:29.468 --> 01:34:31.845
since the War
Between the States?

01:34:31.887 --> 01:34:33.388
That's right.

01:34:36.642 --> 01:34:39.686
This piece was minted in 1910.

01:34:41.605 --> 01:34:43.607
1435
01:34:45,400... > 01:34:48,236
Ben Quick.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:51.114
He salted this place.

01:34:55.868 --> 01:34:58.913
Just took a couple of
hatfuls of silver dollars...

01:34:58.996 --> 01:35:02.374
buried out here one night
in an old canvas bag...

01:35:02.457 --> 01:35:04.627
to catch a sucker like you.

01:35:20.101 --> 01:35:24.438
1441
01:35:28,734... > 01:35:32,780
Someday I'll kill ya.
I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!

01:35:34.448 --> 01:35:36.534
Jody.

01:35:55.467 --> 01:35:57.469
Good night.

01:36:04.644 --> 01:36:06.813
Sister...

01:36:06.896 --> 01:36:08.898
come and have
a nightcap with me.

01:36:24.412 --> 01:36:28.417
Everything settled
with Alan? Huh?

01:36:29.752 --> 01:36:32.379
Yes, it's all settled.

01:36:35.006 --> 01:36:37.343
You mean that?

01:36:37.426 --> 01:36:40.386
Well, I'll drink to that!

01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:42.889
To your weddin'.
It's gonna be a great big one.

01:36:42.972 --> 01:36:46.852
I kinda thought it might be Ben,
but Stewart's more your dish.

01:36:46.935 --> 01:36:50.814
Oh, well. Good name.
Good old family.

01:36:50.856 --> 01:36:54.985
He's kinda weak, though.
We'll bolster him up, though.

01:36:55.069 --> 01:36:57.362
Papa, I'm tired.
I wanna go to bed.

01:36:57.445 --> 01:36:59.489
Oh, no. Not just yet.

01:36:59.572 --> 01:37:04.035
This is a time for father and daughter
to have a little... little talk.

01:37:05.370 --> 01:37:08.623
Finally?

01:37:08.706 --> 01:37:11.751
I know.

01:37:13.251 --> 01:37:15.212
I know.

01:37:15.253 --> 01:37:19.758
There's been a long,
hard silence between us.

01:37:23.012 --> 01:37:25.181
Now's a time
for openin' our hearts.

01:37:28.267 --> 01:37:31.353
I got one, ya know.

01:37:31.436 --> 01:37:34.940
Have you, Papa?
"Honey, I've been eatin'"
the bread of sorrow.

01:37:35.023 --> 01:37:37.734
You made me happy
tonight, but...

01:37:37.818 --> 01:37:42.030
I walked around with a bitterness
chokin' me.

01:37:44.907 --> 01:37:47.703
Parents and children.

01:37:47.786 --> 01:37:53.041
I asked myself,"What are children for?
Why do we have 'em?"

01:37:53.125 --> 01:37:55.168
Well, tonight I know.

01:37:56.378 --> 01:37:58.922
Now I know.
Do ya?

01:38:00.215 --> 01:38:02.759
Oh, I know I been hard on ya...

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:07.762
but... don't feel
you been pushed.

01:38:07.846 --> 01:38:10.766
You're goin'
in the right direction.

01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:14.311
Woman's only half a thing
without a man.

01:38:15.771 --> 01:38:19.192
What do you know
about women, Papa?

01:38:21.445 --> 01:38:23.446
I had the best.

01:38:26.407 --> 01:38:28.951
Your mother and I were just...

01:38:29.035 --> 01:38:31.745
about as close as...

01:38:31.786 --> 01:38:33.914
two people ever get together.

01:38:37.835 --> 01:38:40.503
I wanted to be with that woman
all the time...

01:38:42.256 --> 01:38:44.383
look at her, listen to her...

01:38:45.968 --> 01:38:47.970
touch her.

01:38:50.513 --> 01:38:52.849
She lit up
the whole world for me.

01:38:55.393 --> 01:38:57.478
I'll tell you
somethin' remarkable.

01:38:57.561 --> 01:39:01.732
That woman loved me.
She did, Clara.

01:39:01.815 --> 01:39:04.277
You find that hard
to believe about me?

01:39:05.862 --> 01:39:09.075
A ugly, fat old redneck like me?

01:39:13.412 --> 01:39:15.413
Now, tell me, baby.

01:39:17.331 --> 01:39:19.793
Have I done wrong with you?

01:39:19.834 --> 01:39:22.671
I mean...

01:39:22.754 --> 01:39:26.132
imposin' my will on you...

01:39:26.174 --> 01:39:28.759
shovin' you
this way and the other?

01:39:31.177 --> 01:39:34.389
Sometimes the strong
just roll over the weak.

01:39:37.685 --> 01:39:40.019
Sometimes, Papa.

01:40:10.758 --> 01:40:13.344
Good mornin', Will Varner.
What brings you our way?

01:40:13.386 --> 01:40:16.180
Ahh!
What's come over you, you old fool?

01:40:16.222 --> 01:40:18.224
Don't let it trouble you,
Elizabeth Stewart.

01:40:18.266 --> 01:40:21.269
Give me some coffee, Alan.
It's all in the family, Mother.

01:40:21.352 --> 01:40:23.270
Make it a half a cup.

01:40:23.353 --> 01:40:26.605
We gotta get an early start if I'm
gonna show you all you're gonna get.

01:40:26.689 --> 01:40:29.026
That's gonna take us most of the day.
All I'm gonna get?

01:40:29.067 --> 01:40:32.405
Sure. You don't think I'm gonna send
Clara to you without a stitch, huh?

01:40:32.488 --> 01:40:36.618
I take care of my own.
I'm gonna see to it that you got
the means to take care of Clara.

01:40:36.702 --> 01:40:40.163
Mr. Varner. You're makin' a mistake.
Hmm?

01:40:42.999 --> 01:40:45.876
A mistake?
Yes, sir. A mistake.

01:40:49.462 --> 01:40:52.257
You mean...

01:40:52.341 --> 01:40:54.801
there ain't no engagement
between you two?

01:40:54.885 --> 01:40:57.054
None at all.

01:40:57.095 --> 01:41:00.641
That girl lied!
She lied!

01:41:00.724 --> 01:41:03.060
Have you lost your mind?
Will you shut up!

01:41:03.143 --> 01:41:06.605
I'm talkin' to your sissy son!
If you'll just quiet down a minute...

01:41:06.688 --> 01:41:08.690
I'll tell ya somethin'.

01:41:08.774 --> 01:41:12.485
I'm no good for your daughter.
I never was. I never will be.

01:41:12.568 --> 01:41:16.322
My boy doesn't need any to do
with your family, Will Varner.

01:41:16.405 --> 01:41:18.658
He never wanted it.
Your girl pushed it on him.

01:41:18.741 --> 01:41:21.119
That's not true.
You just keep out of this.

01:41:21.203 --> 01:41:23.287
You shut up!

01:41:26.416 --> 01:41:28.585
I don't want the whole county
to find out that...

01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:31.004
my daughter was jilted
by anybody like you!

01:41:32.088 --> 01:41:34.882
We're not given to gossip!

01:41:34.966 --> 01:41:37.050
You keep a tight lip, boy...

01:41:37.133 --> 01:41:39.553
or I'll come after you
with my bare hands!

01:41:39.637 --> 01:41:41.722
Hear?

01:41:47.561 --> 01:41:51.649
" "" Are you"
going to be home all day, son?

01:42:16.047 --> 01:42:18.133
Ben Quick!

01:42:21.137 --> 01:42:23.096
I'll be back in a minute.

01:42:27.017 --> 01:42:30.478
You got yourself a blue suit?
Get it cleaned!

01:42:30.562 --> 01:42:32.689
You got some black shoes?
Have 'em polished?

01:42:32.772 --> 01:42:35.984
Get yourself a haircut!
You're gonna be married!

01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:39.987
1530
01:42:44,240... > 01:42:46,200
You'll find him at the store, sister!

01:42:47.368 --> 01:42:49.997
Get yourself
down there. Now.

01:42:50.039 --> 01:42:52.542
Yes.

01:42:56.504 --> 01:42:58.944
1534
01:43:14,314... > 01:43:16,607
" Mr. Will! Mr. Will!"
Yeah?

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:19.734
The mare foaled.
"What? When?"

01:43:19.817 --> 01:43:23.780
'Bout half hour ago,
and he is a beauty.

01:43:23.863 --> 01:43:25.823
Well, I better go have a look.

01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:45.260
I'm glad somethin' around here
is gettin' born.

01:44:11.118 --> 01:44:12.911
Jody?

01:44:24.007 --> 01:44:26.258
Well, now, Jody.

01:44:26.341 --> 01:44:28.302
I know that's you out there.

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.430
Jody!

01:44:31.471 --> 01:44:33.432
I'm not sorry.

01:44:33.473 --> 01:44:37.019
I'm not sorry! I'm not sorry! ""

01:44:37.102 --> 01:44:40.062
Jody, at least
let the horses out!

01:44:40.146 --> 01:44:42.814
I'm not sorry!
"Jody!"

01:44:42.897 --> 01:44:45.276
Jody! ""

01:44:52.867 --> 01:44:55.369
"Jody! Jody!"""

01:45:00.665 --> 01:45:02.585
Are you all right, Papa?

01:45:02.668 --> 01:45:06.588
Are you hurt any, Papa?
Papa, are you hurt any?

01:45:06.671 --> 01:45:11.386
"" You got hellfire and damnation
in you, Jody Varner.

01:45:13.012 --> 01:45:14.972
But you got redemption too.

01:45:15.056 --> 01:45:19.096
1554
01:45:17,390... > 01:45:21,394
When I think of the hate that put me
in there and locked the door...

01:45:23.772 --> 01:45:25.732
and set fire to it...

01:45:25.815 --> 01:45:28.985
When I think of the love
that wouldn't let me go...

01:45:29.027 --> 01:45:31.530
I got me a son again!

01:45:31.572 --> 01:45:34.532
I got me a good right arm...

01:45:35.825 --> 01:45:38.995
and a left! ""

01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:45.910
1561
01:46:03,561... > 01:46:08,357
Wait a minute. Only one man in this town
settles his accounts by fire.

01:46:08.399 --> 01:46:10.359
You see this rope?

01:46:10.401 --> 01:46:15.196
I was supposed to catch me a horse with
this rope... a horse I never seen since.

01:46:15.238 --> 01:46:17.741
Maybe I got
a better use for it now.

01:46:17.783 --> 01:46:19.785
Story of my life.

01:46:21.245 --> 01:46:24.207
Why doesn't anyone ever want
to consult with me peaceable?

01:46:24.291 --> 01:46:27.376
I wouldn't fool with them folks, boy.
I'd light out.

01:46:28.585 --> 01:46:30.878
I'm just not in a runnin' mood.

01:46:30.962 --> 01:46:35.049
1570
01:46:48,438... > 01:46:50,607
Get in.

01:46:50.691 --> 01:46:54.069
What's it to you whether I do
or whether I don't, Miss Clara?

01:46:54.111 --> 01:46:55.904
Get in.

01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:15.380
1574
01:47:15,464... > 01:47:17,590

01:47:31.105 --> 01:47:33.825
1576
01:47:33,900... > 01:47:35,817
That's it.
When you got it, use it!

01:47:35.901 --> 01:47:39.112
Papa, are you all right?
'Course. Now, don't you fuss, honey.

01:47:39.154 --> 01:47:42.366
I was scared you...
We got the thing licked.

01:47:42.449 --> 01:47:44.409
There. See?

01:47:49.163 --> 01:47:52.041
Get on over there!
In the back!

01:48:02.051 --> 01:48:03.636
Ben?

01:48:03.678 --> 01:48:05.721
Ben.

01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:12.311
I'm sick of that sight.

01:48:13.396 --> 01:48:15.399
I seen about
50 fires like that...

01:48:15.482 --> 01:48:18.151
or maybe a hundred of'em.

01:48:18.193 --> 01:48:20.195
I seen men
with their shirts on fire...

01:48:21.613 --> 01:48:23.698
smelled horses cookin'.

01:48:25.908 --> 01:48:29.160
I was raised on that smell
of gasoline around me...

01:48:29.202 --> 01:48:31.495
coal oil, kerosene,
anything that'd burn.

01:48:32.705 --> 01:48:34.999
My old man used to
keep 'em around the house...

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.752
in case he had a grudge
he wanted to settle.

01:48:37.836 --> 01:48:39.797
My old man.

01:48:43.508 --> 01:48:45.760
My old man.

01:48:47.012 --> 01:48:49.764
Last time I seen him,
I was about 10 years old...

01:48:51.599 --> 01:48:54.143
lyin' in a ditch,
cryin' my eyes out...

01:48:55.561 --> 01:48:57.856
just prayin' that God
would strike me dead.

01:49:01.067 --> 01:49:05.446
That was the night that I run ahead
to tell on him, turn him in.

01:49:05.529 --> 01:49:08.491
Warned this farmer that he
was comin' with his torch.

01:49:11.661 --> 01:49:13.663
I remember...

01:49:14.748 --> 01:49:17.499
just lyin' there...

01:49:17.583 --> 01:49:19.584
chokin' on my own tears.

01:49:22.670 --> 01:49:26.216
I remember that house burnin' and these
men on horseback and the sound of shots.

01:49:26.258 --> 01:49:28.344
My old man was runnin'.

01:49:31.555 --> 01:49:33.600
Maybe one of them shots
killed him.

01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:37.978
Or maybe he died
in one of them fires he set.

01:49:39.772 --> 01:49:41.813
I don't know.

01:49:41.897 --> 01:49:43.858
I never seen him again.

01:49:45.068 --> 01:49:47.529
How terrible
that must have been.

01:49:47.613 --> 01:49:50.616
No, it wasn't.
The terrible part come later.

01:49:52.117 --> 01:49:54.577
Knockin' around
this whole countryside...

01:49:54.619 --> 01:49:56.746
floatin' around
from town to town...

01:49:58.289 --> 01:50:01.335
Iookin' in on other people's kitchen
windows from the outside.

01:50:03.127 --> 01:50:05.505
Boy, that man sure left
his mark on me.

01:50:05.588 --> 01:50:08.341
I got his name,
and I can't run away from that.

01:50:08.424 --> 01:50:11.260
Yes, you can.

01:50:11.344 --> 01:50:14.472
People are kinder than you think
if you just tell 'em.

01:50:16.766 --> 01:50:19.184
Well, I wouldn't
give 'em that satisfaction.

01:50:19.267 --> 01:50:21.228
I wouldn't tell 'em
anything anytime.

01:50:21.311 --> 01:50:24.106
All right. Then change your name.
Get rid of it.

01:50:24.189 --> 01:50:26.357
I'm a proud man, Miss Clara.

01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:29.278
My name is Quick,
no matter how much people hate it.

01:50:32.197 --> 01:50:34.909
I was one of'em.
I hated it too.

01:50:36.494 --> 01:50:38.496
No, you didn't.

01:50:40.873 --> 01:50:42.875
You hated me.

01:50:46.295 --> 01:50:48.463
I guess I did.

01:50:51.215 --> 01:50:54.802
You're a hardheaded,
softhearted woman, Miss Clara...

01:50:54.885 --> 01:50:56.846
and I like you a lot.

01:50:56.887 --> 01:51:01.310
You do, do you?
Yes, I do. All of a sudden, I do.

01:51:03.769 --> 01:51:09.358
And if you can save my life, I guess I
can return the favor. I can let you go.

01:51:11.444 --> 01:51:13.361
Ain't nothin' to it.

01:51:13.445 --> 01:51:16.824
All I gotta do is pack that old
straw suitcase of mine and...

01:51:16.907 --> 01:51:19.034
say good-bye
to millions.

01:51:19.117 --> 01:51:21.037
I won't even feel sorry
for myself...

01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:24.249
till I get about one mile and a half
outta Frenchman's Bend.

01:51:24.333 --> 01:51:27.252
Well...

01:51:27.336 --> 01:51:31.214
you couldn't"tame" me,
but you"taught" me.

01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:35.425
1638
01:51:47,812... > 01:51:50,900

01:51:50.983 --> 01:51:53.693
1640
01:51:56,780... > 01:51:59,365
Now, hold it.

01:51:59.448 --> 01:52:01.534
Now, hold on, ya hear?

01:52:01.576 --> 01:52:04.079
Will, we can't let that firebug
get away with this!

01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:06.206
We gotta catch him!
The fire is out.

01:52:06.247 --> 01:52:09.418
Thanks to you-all.
Yeah, well, what about Ben Quick?

01:52:09.502 --> 01:52:11.795
The fire's out.
Yeah, but who started it?

01:52:13.212 --> 01:52:15.673
Old jackass name of Will Varner.

01:52:15.756 --> 01:52:19.094
That's who started it.
I dropped my cigar in the hay.

01:52:20.428 --> 01:52:23.806
Ain't that right, Jody?
That's right, Papa.

01:52:23.889 --> 01:52:27.601
What do you know?
Well, I guess our work's done, men.

01:52:27.684 --> 01:52:31.272
You-all come out here Sunday, and we'll
open some kegs of beer and have a party.

01:52:31.355 --> 01:52:33.857
You're gonna have company Sunday, Will!
Thanks, Will!

01:52:33.941 --> 01:52:37.528
Thank you. Man's got friends like you,
he ain't got no trouble!

01:52:37.611 --> 01:52:40.030
Are you all right?
I heard you was in that barn!

01:52:40.114 --> 01:52:42.992
Yeah, in and out.
Now, simmer down, Minnie.

01:52:43.075 --> 01:52:45.034
You ain't a rich widow yet.

01:52:47.705 --> 01:52:50.791
If you got a minute, Will,
I'll be sayin' good-bye.

01:52:50.874 --> 01:52:54.044
You'll be doin' what?
Yeah, I'm leavin', soon as I
get my things together.

01:52:54.128 --> 01:52:55.754
Don't the room and
board here suit ya?

01:52:55.838 --> 01:52:59.842
No, I got no complaints about that.
What is it then?

01:52:59.925 --> 01:53:02.719
Will, you and me, we been in business
only a little while...

01:53:02.802 --> 01:53:06.222
just one hot summer.

01:53:06.306 --> 01:53:09.586
1663
01:53:08,307... > 01:53:10,559
We started off on that horseflesh game,
remember?

01:53:10.642 --> 01:53:13.479
Get to the point.
We sort of left off horses.

01:53:13.563 --> 01:53:16.065
We got started on people.
Now, that's somethin' different.

01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:18.611
Which people you talkin' about?
I'm talkin' about Clara...

01:53:18.652 --> 01:53:20.612
that daughter to Will Varner.

01:53:20.653 --> 01:53:22.655
You wanna stay and hear this?

01:53:22.739 --> 01:53:27.535
Papa, wild horses wouldn't
drag me off this front porch.

01:53:27.619 --> 01:53:30.537
Will, ya know, in all this schemin'
we been doin'...

01:53:30.621 --> 01:53:32.539
we forgot somethin', you and me.

01:53:32.623 --> 01:53:34.750
I get preached to on Sunday!
Yeah, I know...

01:53:34.833 --> 01:53:38.086
and you don't listen...
and neither did I.

01:53:38.170 --> 01:53:40.089
I didn't take too easy
to the idea.

01:53:40.173 --> 01:53:43.009
In fact, I've been a little long
comin' around to it, but...

01:53:43.092 --> 01:53:45.094
Well, life's
a pretty valuable thing...

01:53:45.178 --> 01:53:47.889
and it ought to be treated
with a certain amount of respect.

01:53:47.972 --> 01:53:51.309
You're old enough to know that,
and I'm young enough to learn it.

01:53:51.351 --> 01:53:53.811
Well, isn't that the truth.

01:53:55.394 --> 01:53:57.355
So I'll be
seein' you around, Will.

01:53:57.438 --> 01:54:00.358
First off, nobody give you permission to
call me by my front name!

01:54:00.441 --> 01:54:02.360
Will, that shoutin'
ain't becomin' to you.

01:54:02.443 --> 01:54:04.488
And second,
don't tell me what life is like!

01:54:04.571 --> 01:54:06.824
Life around here
is what I say it is!

01:54:06.908 --> 01:54:08.909
You can't always have it
your way, Will.

01:54:08.992 --> 01:54:12.411
I got influence. I'll dog you
wherever you go. I'll break you.

01:54:12.495 --> 01:54:16.248
No, you won't.
You'll miss me.

01:54:20.878 --> 01:54:23.798
What are you grinnin' about?

01:54:23.881 --> 01:54:27.344
Huh? Now there's
your gratitude.

01:54:27.427 --> 01:54:31.180
There's your thanks! I put
that boy where there was fast,
easy money just layin' there.

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:34.226
I put him in the Garden of Eden,
let him dip his bread in honey...

01:54:34.268 --> 01:54:37.604
and he's got the all-out gall
to tell me no!

01:54:37.688 --> 01:54:40.273
1694
01:54:40,356... > 01:54:42,650
I gotcha!

01:54:42.733 --> 01:54:45.735
Mmm.

01:54:51.324 --> 01:54:55.078
So you run, and you
keep on runnin'...

01:54:55.161 --> 01:54:58.790
and you buy yourself a bus ticket
and you disappear.

01:54:58.873 --> 01:55:02.712
And you change your name
and you dye your hair...

01:55:02.795 --> 01:55:06.715
and maybe...
just maybe...

01:55:06.798 --> 01:55:08.883
you might be safe from me.

01:55:13.681 --> 01:55:16.392
1702
01:55:16,517... > 01:55:20,270

01:55:20.353 --> 01:55:23.148
Do I know human nature, huh?

01:55:23.231 --> 01:55:26.274
Didn't I say that fella Quick
was made for my Clara?

01:55:27.901 --> 01:55:31.196
Am I gonna be a grandfather?
I am!

01:55:32.865 --> 01:55:37.203
Oh, Minnie, it sure is good
to be alive this summer evenin'.

01:55:37.287 --> 01:55:40.205
Yeah, alive with friends
and family...

01:55:40.289 --> 01:55:42.833
and a big healthy woman
to love ya.

01:55:42.916 --> 01:55:45.794
Oh, I "like" life, Minnie.

01:55:45.878 --> 01:55:48.882
Yeah. I like it
so much...

01:55:50.299 --> 01:55:52.676
I might just live forever.
