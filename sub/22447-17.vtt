Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.460 --> 00:07.830
I need someone
to do my math homework.

00:07.830 --> 00:10.500
-Me? (scoffs)
-You are my tutor.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.620
-You're right.
-About what?

00:12.620 --> 00:14.790
Right about me
not having a moral code.

00:14.790 --> 00:17.210
Which means you still
want me to do your homework.

00:17.210 --> 00:18.420
You're right.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.620
-Thanks.
-What's really going on?

00:25.620 --> 00:30.330
Sometimes I get kind of stressed
and can't catch my breath.

00:30.330 --> 00:33.500
-Sounds like
a panic attack.
-Yeah.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.080
I regret not saying yes
to Bowie when he proposed.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.540
I'm... thrilled!

00:39.540 --> 00:42.000
Come on,
you need to call Bowie
and tell him, now!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.420
I'm not gonna do that, ever.

00:44.420 --> 00:49.000
So, it's okay?
I can stay with you?

one night alone without her.

Any chance you think
she'd talk to me?

01:38.580 --> 01:41.620
Don't ask her!
Just... if you think
she's ready to talk to me,

01:41.620 --> 01:43.620
say... "Rococo."

01:43.620 --> 01:45.710
No, that sounds
like a code word.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.790
I don't know if you
remember me.

12:01.790 --> 12:03.500
I just said your name.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.380
I was a caricature artist
at a bar mitzvah party.

12:06.380 --> 12:10.420
-I know.
-Oh. Um, okay.
Just checkin'.

12:10.420 --> 12:14.000
-What?
- Take care. Bye.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.380
Walker!

12:15.380 --> 12:18.210
Are you kidding me?
What was that?

What are you doing
right now?

12:33.330 --> 12:35.880
Hey.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.080
Those smell amazing.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.500
Roasted cashews.

12:40.790 --> 12:42.170
They're so good.

12:43.580 --> 12:46.790
Oh, I'm... sorry,
did you want some?

12:46.790 --> 12:48.790
Well... yeah.

12:48.790 --> 12:51.000
That's good, because...

12:52.290 --> 12:54.080
I got you
your own bag.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.330
Thanks.

12:58.670 --> 13:02.290
So, are we heading somewhere
or are we just rambling?

13:02.290 --> 13:04.120
I'm fine with either,
by the way.

13:04.120 --> 13:07.120
I'm taking you to one
of my favorite art galleries.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.290
It's my favorite
because I have
a painting there.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.210
You have a painting
in an art gallery?

13:13.210 --> 13:16.540
-Wow.
-Manage your
expectations, please.

13:16.540 --> 13:19.460

you're really good at this,

I mean, I don't have
to teach you anything,

15:33.670 --> 15:35.540
it's already there,
inside of you.

15:35.540 --> 15:38.250
It's kinda crazy.
I-- I never knew
I could do this,

15:38.250 --> 15:41.500

do it all the time.

You need a teacher,
a real one.

15:44.830 --> 15:46.170
I'm gonna send you to Sid.

15:46.170 --> 15:47.460
Who's Sid?

15:47.460 --> 15:49.580
The best studio musician.

15:49.580 --> 15:52.210
A perfectionist.
Very prickly.

15:52.210 --> 15:53.290
Difficult to work with.

15:53.290 --> 15:55.250
He sounds fun.

15:55.250 --> 15:58.290
Only because she's better
than everyone else,

15:58.290 --> 16:00.380
which makes her
a great teacher.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.330
If she accepts you.

16:02.330 --> 16:05.210
She doesn't take
a lot of students,
so you'll have to audition.

16:05.210 --> 16:06.620
I don't know.

16:06.620 --> 16:08.380
Don't worry,
she's gonna love you.

16:08.380 --> 16:10.540

16:10.540 --> 16:12.290
Yes! You're in!

16:13.380 --> 16:16.460
Tomorrow?
I-- I'm not ready.
I only know one song.

16:16.460 --> 16:19.540
Oh, you can't play that song.
She hates that song.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.500
Do you want me
to have another panic attack?

16:21.500 --> 16:24.250
No, of course not.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.290
But you're not having one,
and I think I know why.

16:27.290 --> 16:31.500
Because deep down inside...
you know you're ready.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.080
All right.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.250

I'm back on the team.

Since when?

Since I told Coleman
that I might have dyscalculia.

that's what it's called.

17:55.290 --> 17:59.750

you finally told him.

Me too.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.790
Well... welcome back.

18:03.790 --> 18:06.290
I guess.

18:06.290 --> 18:10.460
Oh, uh, before you go in,
you need to go talk
to Coleman.

18:10.460 --> 18:12.290
About what?

18:12.290 --> 18:15.540
I kind of told him
that you did my homework.

18:15.540 --> 18:18.250
Did you tell him
that you asked me to?

18:18.250 --> 18:19.460
Of course.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.000
I'm changed!

18:21.000 --> 18:23.120
I'm a completely
open book now.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.620
But I hope not.

18:29.620 --> 18:32.000
I heard
you played a great game
against the Raptors.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.250
Everything you've just said
is a lie.

18:37.580 --> 18:38.380
Isn't it?

18:41.620 --> 18:42.920
Old habits die hard.

18:44.170 --> 18:45.500
I'm really trying, though.

you're right.

18:51.460 --> 18:53.170

18:53.170 --> 18:55.580
No. I'm saying you're right.

18:55.580 --> 18:57.540
You say that to me a lot.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.000
Especially when you want me
to do something for you.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.250
Such as your homework.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.960
I don't know, maybe.

19:06.960 --> 19:10.750

-So it's almost like
someone told you to say that.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.250
Someone who knows me
really well.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.670

Decide.
