00:00.239 --> 00:01.839
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.940 --> 00:05.310
- What's up, good lookin'?
- Idiot.

00:06.776 --> 00:09.010
You wanna kill somebody?
It ain't gonna be us.

00:09.045 --> 00:11.045
- Hey, Callie.
- Hey.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.647
Do you forgive me?

00:12.682 --> 00:15.016
You were hands down the best Juliet.

00:15.051 --> 00:16.067
Would you be in my musical?

00:16.119 --> 00:17.618
You canceled the check?

00:17.654 --> 00:18.970
The one you stole
from me? You bet I did.

00:19.005 --> 00:20.888
I hate you, and Daddy hated you too,

00:20.890 --> 00:23.007
and that's why he killed himself.

00:23.042 --> 00:25.793
We got all the plants
and materials donated

00:25.828 --> 00:26.827
thanks to Monte!

00:26.879 --> 00:28.729
- So have you read it, the bill?
- No.

00:28.765 --> 00:31.666
I just don't like seeing kids
being sold to the higher bidders.

00:31.701 --> 00:33.701
And let's be honest, Rita,
you have your own agenda.

00:33.736 --> 00:34.769
That's what you think of me?

00:34.804 --> 00:36.621
I'm kind of worried about Jesus.

00:36.673 --> 00:37.738
He found our birth dad.

00:37.774 --> 00:39.056
The guy's a sex offender.

00:39.092 --> 00:40.658
He's on that list because of me.

00:40.693 --> 00:42.710
I was 15, he was 18.

00:42.712 --> 00:44.095
I don't know what you're looking for.

00:44.130 --> 00:46.948
I'm not your father and I never will be.

00:52.121 --> 00:53.921
Mariana, watch it please!

00:53.957 --> 00:54.889
Sorry, Mom.

00:56.659 --> 00:59.794
Emotional Intelligence. What's that?

00:59.846 --> 01:02.863
It's the ability to express
your emotions in a positive way.

01:02.899 --> 01:04.799
Your EQ instead of your IQ.

01:04.834 --> 01:07.735
So you're, like, taking a class?

01:07.787 --> 01:09.837
No, I'm teaching a class as part of
the department's Youth Outreach Program.

01:09.839 --> 01:12.740
No offense, but who would
want to take a class like this?

01:12.775 --> 01:15.042
Kids who have a choice between
it and juvie, that's who.

01:15.044 --> 01:17.645
"What is an appropriate
response to anger?

01:17.680 --> 01:20.715
"'A', beat someone
up, 'B', start a fire,

01:20.750 --> 01:22.650
'C', get drunk,

01:22.702 --> 01:24.952
'D', express your feelings
with words?" Seriously?

01:25.004 --> 01:26.053
For this kids that I am teaching

01:26.089 --> 01:29.040
who don't have good
parenting or a stable home,

01:29.092 --> 01:31.859
'D' is not necessarily the
obvious choice, Mariana.

01:31.894 --> 01:34.912
Hey, check it out.

01:34.964 --> 01:37.798
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow! I love it!

01:37.834 --> 01:39.867
- Wow, Brandon.
- That is amazing.

01:39.902 --> 01:40.868
Yeah, Mat designed it.

01:40.870 --> 01:43.721
Hm. Well, it must have been hard

01:43.773 --> 01:44.772
with Zoey's tongue down his throat.

01:44.824 --> 01:46.791
- Hey!
- Mat's dating Zoey?

01:46.843 --> 01:49.677
Yeah, and I find it very
unprofessional if you ask me,

01:49.712 --> 01:51.746
but the director totally rejected

01:51.781 --> 01:53.731
the idea of a no dating policy, so...

01:53.766 --> 01:55.983
Oh, please. You just don't
want to see Mat with anyone else

01:56.035 --> 01:57.918
even though you're dating
that Nick guy or whatever.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.086
I am not.

01:59.138 --> 02:01.022
I went on one date with him
and it was a total disaster.

02:01.024 --> 02:01.989
Why? What happened?

02:03.926 --> 02:04.892
Nothing. It was just boring.

02:06.017 --> 02:07.016
Uh, well, Brandon,

02:07.018 --> 02:09.818
I think that poster is
absolutely beautiful.

02:09.854 --> 02:10.886
I'm very proud of you,

02:10.922 --> 02:12.822
how hard you've been working
on your senior project.

02:12.857 --> 02:15.758
Yeah, I guess I didn't realize how
much time it would take exactly.

02:15.810 --> 02:17.760
Well, what about your
Juilliard audition?

02:17.795 --> 02:19.628
You know, don't drop
the ball on that please.

02:19.664 --> 02:21.647
Oh, no. I... I won't.
Um, I... I've got time.

02:21.699 --> 02:23.666
Mom, I actually... I
wanted to ask you, um,

02:23.701 --> 02:25.017
do you think we could
rehearse on the gym stage?

02:25.053 --> 02:26.702
It's just that the art room
is getting a little small

02:26.738 --> 02:28.671
- now that we're casting the other parts.
- I'll talk to Monte,

02:28.706 --> 02:29.972
- but I don't see why not.
- All right.

02:30.008 --> 02:31.640
Okay, everybody. Come
on. Let's get a move on.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.609
Jesus, you gonna put some
clothes on sometime today?

02:33.661 --> 02:34.927
I don't have a first period today.

02:34.962 --> 02:36.045
My teacher's at a conference.

02:36.047 --> 02:37.897
What kind of school
you runnin' over there?

02:37.949 --> 02:40.016
Oh, and hey, and listen, Mike
is out of town for a little bit,

02:40.051 --> 02:41.967
so AJ's gonna stay with us.

02:42.020 --> 02:44.787
- For how long?
- Just a couple of days.

02:44.822 --> 02:46.005
Jude doesn't get back from
his school trip until Friday,

02:46.057 --> 02:47.757
so he can sleep in his bed.

02:47.792 --> 02:48.908
Great, I finally get the room to myself,

02:48.943 --> 02:50.793
and now I gotta share it again?

02:50.828 --> 02:51.827
You know what?

02:51.863 --> 02:53.896
May I have your b... b...

02:53.931 --> 02:55.781
Thank you, Callie.

02:55.833 --> 02:59.602
So, uh, there's something
I need to tell you.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.653
Something you should know.

03:00.705 --> 03:02.655
Um, AJ and I are kind of dating.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.609
Oh. Sorry. I... I forgot my poster.

03:09.047 --> 03:10.930
Uh... okay.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.866
Well, we're not fostering
him, so I guess there's not

03:13.918 --> 03:15.551
an illegal issue if he stays here.

03:15.603 --> 03:17.553
But as with any boyfriend in the house,

03:17.588 --> 03:18.838
we expect you to follow the rules.

03:18.873 --> 03:20.005
You know, no hanging
out behind closed doors.

03:20.058 --> 03:21.023
Oh, of course not.

03:21.059 --> 03:22.858
Thank you for telling us.

03:24.829 --> 03:25.961
Is anyone home?

03:27.000 --> 03:33.074

04:25.439 --> 04:28.674
Hey, I was gonna talk to you about AJ.

04:28.709 --> 04:29.792
Oh, yeah? When?

04:29.844 --> 04:32.795
When we're sure we
know what we're doing.

04:32.847 --> 04:34.713
It... it's fine. It's whatever.

04:34.765 --> 04:37.766
I mean, technically there's something
I haven't told you either, so...

04:37.802 --> 04:38.801
What?

04:38.853 --> 04:42.638
Um... I'm seeing someone.

04:43.808 --> 04:45.641
Do I know her?

04:45.693 --> 04:46.675
No.

04:46.711 --> 04:48.694
She's older.

04:48.729 --> 04:49.812
Older? Okay.

04:49.814 --> 04:50.813
Just a little.

04:50.865 --> 04:53.782
She's just not in high school.

05:08.716 --> 05:11.750
Still mad at me?

05:11.802 --> 05:12.801
Still an idiot?

05:12.837 --> 05:14.720
Go out with me again.

05:16.674 --> 05:17.756
- No.
- Why not?

05:17.842 --> 05:19.842
Because you're a douche and
you could have killed us!

05:19.894 --> 05:21.644
You were driving like a maniac.

05:21.679 --> 05:22.761
I was in total control of the car!

05:22.813 --> 05:24.647
No one's in control
when they're speeding

05:24.682 --> 05:25.681
and weaving in and out of traffic.

05:25.733 --> 05:26.849
That guy was hitting on you.

05:26.851 --> 05:28.651
What was I supposed to do?

05:28.686 --> 05:29.685
Nothing!

05:29.687 --> 05:30.853
You were supposed to do nothing!

05:30.855 --> 05:32.771
You know what your problem is?

05:32.823 --> 05:35.658
- Hm?
- You have no emotional intelligence.

05:36.777 --> 05:37.743
What does that mean?

05:37.778 --> 05:39.695
Exactly.

05:42.700 --> 05:43.866
We could use the
community outreach money.

05:43.901 --> 05:44.867
We've got that leftover

05:44.869 --> 05:46.835
since Sally got all
the materials donated.

05:46.871 --> 05:49.872
Yes, since Sally got everything donated.

05:49.874 --> 05:52.625
How's that going anyway?

05:52.677 --> 05:54.627
Oh. Um, I think everything's a go

05:54.679 --> 05:55.711
to start planting this weekend.

05:55.763 --> 05:56.712
Great.

05:56.764 --> 05:58.597
But I'm keeping my distance

05:58.633 --> 06:00.816
so there won't be any
perception of impropriety.

06:04.639 --> 06:07.640
Speaking of senior projects,
Brandon wanted to know

06:07.692 --> 06:09.775
if he could use the
gym space for rehearsal.

06:09.810 --> 06:11.727
- Would that be okay?
- Yeah, of course.

06:12.780 --> 06:14.563
But...

06:15.666 --> 06:16.699
What?

06:16.734 --> 06:18.667
I was gonna wait to
talk to you about this

06:18.703 --> 06:19.735
till I had a little more information,

06:19.770 --> 06:20.836
but we might have a problem.

06:20.871 --> 06:23.706
Some students have expressed concerns

06:23.741 --> 06:24.740
about the play itself.

06:25.793 --> 06:27.676
Romeo and Juliet?

06:27.712 --> 06:28.744
Yeah.

06:28.779 --> 06:29.795
They don't think it's appropriate.

06:38.756 --> 06:39.755
Hey.

06:40.825 --> 06:41.790
Yep.

06:45.663 --> 06:47.596
Calculus?

06:47.632 --> 06:49.765
Do you really understand this stuff?

06:49.800 --> 06:51.734
- Most of it, yeah.
- Really?

06:51.769 --> 06:53.636
Why do you sound surprised?

06:53.671 --> 06:55.938
Nothing. It's... you're just an artist.

06:55.990 --> 07:00.509
I thought art and math were,
like, mutually exclusive.

07:00.561 --> 07:02.578
Not at all, not at all. Look.

07:02.613 --> 07:04.496
Have a seat, missy.

07:04.532 --> 07:05.914
Look at this.

07:08.819 --> 07:09.985
Drawing is kind of mathematical

07:10.021 --> 07:11.720
when you break it down.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.874
See? It's all geometry and perspective.

07:18.679 --> 07:20.729
And then there's this thing
called the golden ratio.

07:20.765 --> 07:21.780
That just helps out with proportion.

07:28.806 --> 07:31.523
- Very cool.
- Yeah.

07:32.610 --> 07:34.543
You are not just a work of art, Callie.

07:34.578 --> 07:36.629
You are a mathematical equation
which I have yet to solve.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.615
Seriously, that was, like,

07:39.650 --> 07:41.917
the worst line I've ever heard.

07:43.554 --> 07:44.987
- Was it?
- Yeah!

07:44.989 --> 07:46.588
Hey.

07:48.592 --> 07:49.792
Hey.

07:50.911 --> 07:53.762
I'll... I'll be in the garage.

07:59.704 --> 08:03.605
So look, I told my moms that we're...

08:03.641 --> 08:06.625
you know, whatever we
are just so... you know,

08:06.661 --> 08:08.594
it wasn't like we were...

08:08.646 --> 08:10.612
like, hiding something from them.

08:10.648 --> 08:11.947
Not that there's anything to hide.

08:14.602 --> 08:15.984
- What?
- Nothing.

08:17.555 --> 08:19.888
I'm just glad you thought
whatever we are is worth

08:19.924 --> 08:20.923
talking to your moms about.

08:22.560 --> 08:23.859
Inappropriate?

08:23.894 --> 08:25.928
How is  R&J  inappropriate?

08:25.980 --> 08:27.946
Some students feel like
it could be a trigger

08:27.998 --> 08:30.716
for teen suicide, and we
have to be sensitive to that.

08:30.768 --> 08:31.850
A trigger? Really? Are you kidding me?

08:31.902 --> 08:32.868
It's Shakespeare!

08:32.903 --> 08:34.837
I mean, it's not like
he's endorsing suicide.

08:34.905 --> 08:35.837
It's called tragedy for a reason!

08:35.890 --> 08:37.639
I agree and I'm gonna fight it.

08:37.674 --> 08:38.691
Good!

08:38.743 --> 08:41.592
I mean, you realize this
is my senior project.

08:41.629 --> 08:43.746
Like, if this doesn't
happen, I can't graduate!

08:43.780 --> 08:45.781
I know. I'm not gonna let that happen.

08:45.783 --> 08:48.016
I just wanted you to
know what's going on.

08:48.052 --> 08:49.685
I mean, who is it?
Who are these students?

08:49.687 --> 08:51.653
Brandon, you know I can't tell you that.

08:51.689 --> 08:53.539
Listen. Listen to me.

08:54.692 --> 08:57.493
I don't want you taking
matters into your own hands.

08:57.528 --> 08:58.527
All right?

08:58.562 --> 08:59.928
Let me handle it.

09:02.967 --> 09:04.833
So the purpose of this exercise

09:04.885 --> 09:08.821
is to use the letters
of your name and write

09:08.856 --> 09:10.973
something that you think is a
positive trait about yourself.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.892
So, the first letter in my name is 'S',

09:13.928 --> 09:16.662
so I'm gonna write "strong". I'm strong.

09:16.697 --> 09:17.780
The second letter is a 'T'.

09:17.832 --> 09:19.681
Anyone think of a positive trait

09:19.717 --> 09:21.784
that we could use starting
with the letter 'T'?

09:21.819 --> 09:23.786
"Tits".

09:26.724 --> 09:28.557
What? You got great tits.

09:28.576 --> 09:29.691
That's a positive trait.

09:29.693 --> 09:31.543
"Tenacious".

09:31.595 --> 09:33.629
I'm tenacious...

09:33.664 --> 09:34.980
empathetic...

09:36.700 --> 09:38.667
and fierce.

09:38.669 --> 09:41.520
Okay, so that's me.

09:41.555 --> 09:42.571
What are you?

09:42.606 --> 09:43.956
- Hell, I'm fierce.
- Yeah?

09:43.991 --> 09:45.541
I wish I had an 'F' in my name.

09:45.576 --> 09:47.559
Let's see, you got a 'P'.
Got a 'P' in your name.

09:47.595 --> 09:48.944
How about "powerful"? You're powerful.

09:48.979 --> 09:49.945
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

09:49.947 --> 09:50.996
Yeah, I'm powerful.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.965
- All right, you're powerful.
- What's this crap?

09:53.017 --> 09:54.900
Excuse me?

09:54.935 --> 09:56.869
You're being disruptive.

09:56.904 --> 09:58.003
I need you to sit down please.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.823
The other popo who taught
the class brought donuts.

10:00.858 --> 10:01.824
Really?

10:01.876 --> 10:02.875
Where's the donuts?

10:02.910 --> 10:04.810
Yeah. Where's the chips?

10:04.845 --> 10:06.728
And what the hell is this right here?

10:06.764 --> 10:08.697
"Hummus"?

10:08.732 --> 10:10.699
It looks like diarrhea.

10:10.734 --> 10:11.817
Smells like it too.

10:11.852 --> 10:15.637
Okay, your behavior right
now is inappropriate.

10:15.673 --> 10:17.639
I would like you to go and sit down.

10:17.675 --> 10:19.741
Uh, I'm telling you how I feel.

10:19.777 --> 10:21.627
I mean, isn't that what this
whole class is all about?

10:21.679 --> 10:22.978
That's true.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.613
Yeah. Okay.

10:24.648 --> 10:25.964
Sure.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Can you identify the emotion that
you're feeling right now then?

10:28.052 --> 10:29.902
Yeah. I'm mad.

10:29.954 --> 10:32.588
Okay, great. So, when
you're disappointed,

10:32.656 --> 10:34.056
you get mad. Is that fair to say?

10:34.091 --> 10:37.993
Okay, then so what would be an
appropriate response to this situation?

10:43.834 --> 10:44.800
Okay, get out.

10:44.835 --> 10:46.668
The judge ordered me to be here.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.903
You can't just kick me out.

10:47.938 --> 10:48.854
Try me.

10:50.708 --> 10:51.874
Okay, lady.

10:51.876 --> 10:53.809
- But this one's on you.
- Okay.

10:57.681 --> 10:59.548
Ooh, can we go too?

10:59.550 --> 11:01.617
Absolutely. If you'd rather be
in juvie than here, feel free.

11:01.652 --> 11:02.684
Anybody else want to join him?

11:05.656 --> 11:07.556
If schools start
putting trigger warnings

11:07.608 --> 11:09.024
on every book or play that
could be upsetting to someone,

11:09.059 --> 11:11.593
how are we supposed to
learn to think for ourselves?

11:11.629 --> 11:13.562
I'm sure Mom's not
gonna let them kill  R&J.

11:13.564 --> 11:14.563
Well, she better not.

11:16.033 --> 11:18.967
Ooh, another portrait?

11:19.003 --> 11:19.985
Someone's in love.

11:20.037 --> 11:21.036
We are not in love.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.905
Maybe you aren't.

11:24.008 --> 11:26.775
So tell me, is it weird knowing

11:26.810 --> 11:28.810
that AJ's sleeping in the next room?

11:29.847 --> 11:32.714
- Um, no.
- In his boxers...

11:33.918 --> 11:35.751
Seriously!

11:35.803 --> 11:37.853
Do you think you can resist
sneaking into his room later?

11:37.888 --> 11:39.855
I'm sure I'll find a way.

11:42.625 --> 11:43.625
_

11:44.094 --> 11:46.028
Nick's, like, stalking
me all of a sudden.

11:46.063 --> 11:47.062
Really?

11:53.053 --> 11:54.052
Oh, my God!

11:54.088 --> 11:56.071
Now he's outside!

12:01.912 --> 12:03.779
Do I have to get a restraining order?

12:03.781 --> 12:05.914
- You know my mom's a cop.
- Yeah, which is why I've been trying to call you.

12:09.870 --> 12:10.869
He's pretty loaded.

12:10.921 --> 12:12.688
You got him drunk?

12:12.723 --> 12:14.690
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I...

12:14.725 --> 12:15.791
Just don't. Just... just go.

12:15.826 --> 12:17.643
Get out of here before
I do go get my mom.

12:22.633 --> 12:24.600
Okay, how the hell are
we gonna get him upstairs?

12:31.025 --> 12:32.991
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.611
- So how'd it go?
- Fine.

12:35.646 --> 12:36.678
But I think you're right.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.647
I think taking on extra work right now

12:38.682 --> 12:39.948
is just a little too much for me.

12:39.950 --> 12:41.850
- Well, did something happen?
- No, no.

12:41.885 --> 12:45.954
But if you don't mind, I think, um...

12:45.990 --> 12:48.757
I think I'm gonna ask if they could find

12:48.809 --> 12:49.925
another officer to replace me.

12:49.927 --> 12:51.860
Of course I don't mind.

12:52.896 --> 12:53.912
Yeah, come in.

12:55.766 --> 12:57.683
Hey. Um...

12:57.735 --> 12:59.701
do you have a second to talk?

12:59.737 --> 13:00.802
- Sure.
- Okay, good,

13:00.838 --> 13:02.721
because I need your advice on something.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.726
Okay. What is it?

13:07.761 --> 13:10.662
It's about...

13:10.698 --> 13:12.981
do you remember when
I dyed my hair blond?

13:16.603 --> 13:18.620
What the hell are you feeding this guy?

13:18.622 --> 13:19.588
I know.

13:22.609 --> 13:23.992
- What was that?
- Can you please stay focused?

13:24.044 --> 13:26.595
I mean, y... you ask us to talk to you,

13:26.597 --> 13:28.947
and then you just get
all distracted and...

13:28.983 --> 13:32.968
You know, there's been so
many famous blond Juliets.

13:32.970 --> 13:34.903
- Okay.
- I'm gonna put you in the bed right now.

13:34.955 --> 13:37.806
- You ready?
- Okay. Okay.

13:37.841 --> 13:38.807
All right.

13:38.842 --> 13:40.742
I should turn him on his side

13:40.778 --> 13:42.744
just in case he pukes.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.845
Here.

13:43.881 --> 13:45.714
Here's a trash can.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.587
Thank you for doing this.

13:52.623 --> 13:53.655
I know you could get in trouble.

13:53.691 --> 13:55.057
Yeah, we all could.

13:59.997 --> 14:00.996
Goodnight.

14:04.601 --> 14:05.934
I guess Romeo doesn't really care

14:05.969 --> 14:07.936
if Juliet's a blond or a brunette.

14:09.039 --> 14:11.807
Hey. Uh, I just wanted to say goodnight.

14:11.842 --> 14:12.874
- Goodnight, sweetheart.
- Goodnight, love.

14:13.961 --> 14:15.944
Okay, well, um...

14:15.979 --> 14:18.780
I think I'm just gonna
stay a brunette Juliet.

14:18.816 --> 14:19.765
Thanks for the advice.

14:24.688 --> 14:25.637
That was close.

14:34.598 --> 14:37.666
Hey, Callie. This is
Chloe, Rita's daughter.

14:37.701 --> 14:40.635
My mom changed her number again.

14:40.671 --> 14:44.573
She won't take my calls, so...

14:45.609 --> 14:47.008
can you tell her goodbye for me...

14:48.879 --> 14:50.779
that I forgive her,

14:50.831 --> 14:52.764
and I'm sorry?

14:53.851 --> 14:55.784
I don't know what's gonna happen to me,

14:55.819 --> 14:57.753
but maybe we'd both be better off

14:57.788 --> 14:58.854
if I wasn't around anymore.

15:11.917 --> 15:12.966
Since when do you knock?

15:12.968 --> 15:15.786
No, I know. I just, um,
I didn't want to barge in,

15:15.821 --> 15:17.204
but you never got
back to me about Chloe.

15:17.206 --> 15:18.305
I texted you.

15:18.340 --> 15:19.840
Yeah, but did you call her back?

15:19.875 --> 15:21.274
No, I didn't call her,

15:21.310 --> 15:22.793
but I'm sure she's fine.

15:22.828 --> 15:24.811
I mean, as fine as she can be.

15:24.847 --> 15:26.113
How do you know that?

15:26.148 --> 15:28.215
Sounded like she really might
hurt herself or something.

15:29.284 --> 15:31.017
Do you want to come in?

15:36.125 --> 15:39.025
The first time I got a
message like that from Chloe,

15:39.061 --> 15:41.962
I dropped everything and
ran to wherever it was

15:41.997 --> 15:43.063
that she was living at the time,

15:43.098 --> 15:46.967
and after a very convincing
performance, she swore

15:47.002 --> 15:49.035
that she would get help
and go back on her meds

15:49.071 --> 15:50.871
if I wrote her a check,

15:50.906 --> 15:52.823
which I did.

15:52.875 --> 15:53.924
And then I fell for it again,

15:53.976 --> 15:56.243
and then the next time,
and the time after that,

15:56.278 --> 15:57.844
but finally I got it.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.246
I was not helping my daughter.

15:59.281 --> 16:01.148
I was actually enabling her

16:01.150 --> 16:02.782
to continue her destructive behavior.

16:02.818 --> 16:04.184
Well, maybe this time's different.

16:04.219 --> 16:05.819
No, it's not.

16:05.854 --> 16:09.089
When Chloe's on her meds,
she starts feeling better.

16:09.124 --> 16:12.025
When she starts feeling better,
she decides to stop her meds.

16:12.060 --> 16:14.094
And when she stops her
meds, she doesn't realize

16:14.129 --> 16:15.195
just how sick she actually is.

16:15.230 --> 16:18.131
I'm really sorry for the
position she put you in,

16:18.167 --> 16:20.934
having you reach out to me.

16:20.969 --> 16:22.035
But trust me,

16:22.070 --> 16:24.938
she is not going to kill herself,

16:24.973 --> 16:27.841
and nothing is gonna
change until she changes.

16:28.977 --> 16:31.878
Can't you just talk to her
without giving her money?

16:31.880 --> 16:32.913
I have tried.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.848
So what? You just stop trying?

16:34.900 --> 16:36.333
She's your daughter.

16:36.368 --> 16:39.286
Aren't... aren't you supposed to
take every suicide threat seriously?

16:39.321 --> 16:41.188
Look, Callie,

16:41.223 --> 16:43.089
I really don't expect you to understand.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.124
I know.

16:44.159 --> 16:46.092
Because you're the only
one who's ever right.

16:46.128 --> 16:48.078
You know, maybe you're the
one that needs to change.

16:48.130 --> 16:49.296
Maybe if you listened
instead of always telling

16:49.331 --> 16:51.181
everybody they don't know
what they're talking about...

16:51.293 --> 16:54.060
Is this about me and my daughter
or is this about me and you?

16:54.112 --> 16:55.111
Does it matter?

16:55.147 --> 16:57.063
It is always your way or the highway.

16:57.099 --> 17:00.934
Look, Callie, I know you don't
want to hear this right now,

17:00.969 --> 17:03.970
but you are on the wrong side
of this foster reform bill.

17:04.006 --> 17:05.905
This is not reform at all.

17:05.941 --> 17:06.940
It is business as usual.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.009
In fact, you know what?
It's actually worse.

17:09.044 --> 17:11.011
- I didn't come to argue this again.
- Why did you come here?

17:11.012 --> 17:13.046
Because I thought that since
Chloe's Dad killed himself

17:13.080 --> 17:15.015
that maybe you wouldn't
want to take any chances.

17:22.257 --> 17:24.307
So you're the one behind this.

17:24.343 --> 17:26.326
Not just me. A lot of
students feel that way.

17:26.361 --> 17:28.828
Yeah? Well, this is what
I think of your petition.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.231
No one's saying suicide is sexy.

17:31.266 --> 17:34.167
Teen suicide is a real problem, Brandon.

17:34.169 --> 17:35.335
A big one!

17:35.370 --> 17:38.071
God, and you're glamorizing
it by staging your play!

17:38.073 --> 17:40.073
It's not my play! It's Shakespeare's!

17:40.075 --> 17:42.142
And it's done in more schools
than any other play in history!

17:42.177 --> 17:44.044
That doesn't make it right!

17:44.079 --> 17:46.913
Last summer, my best
friend's sister hung herself

17:46.948 --> 17:48.064
after her boyfriend broke up with her.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.083
Suicide is a real tragedy, Brandon.

17:50.118 --> 17:51.951
Not just some dumb way to end a play.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.888
And don't think this is over just 'cause
you ripped up a piece of paper, okay?

17:54.923 --> 17:56.256
There's a lot more where that came from.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.245
Ugh, you still smell like a frat house.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.264
You know, don't judge.
You've been drunk before.

18:04.266 --> 18:05.849
Yeah, at a party.

18:05.901 --> 18:07.233
Not by myself on a Monday.

18:07.269 --> 18:08.835
- What the hell are you doing?
- You know what?

18:08.870 --> 18:10.086
Leave me alone.

18:13.308 --> 18:15.175
All right. Later.

18:15.210 --> 18:16.159
Hey.

18:17.245 --> 18:19.145
Hey.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.064
Jesus told me that you
weren't drinking with him,

18:21.099 --> 18:24.200
that he just called you
to get a ride home, so...

18:24.252 --> 18:26.052
I'm sorry I bit your head off.

18:27.122 --> 18:29.956
I'm not gonna lie, I was upset at first,

18:29.975 --> 18:32.892
but I was able to stay present
and factor my emotional memory

18:32.928 --> 18:35.862
into my decision making process,
at which point I realized

18:35.897 --> 18:37.997
my being defensive was why you
refused to forgive me to other night.

18:38.033 --> 18:41.000
But what I should have done
was apologize for scaring you

18:41.036 --> 18:44.304
by driving too fast,
beg your forgiveness...

18:44.339 --> 18:45.939
and ask for another chance.

18:45.941 --> 18:47.240
Huh?

18:47.292 --> 18:49.309
I looked up "emotional intelligence".

18:49.344 --> 18:52.295
I'm trying to positively
resolve this conflict

18:52.330 --> 18:53.379
with the use of humor
and accountability.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.200
So...

18:57.235 --> 19:01.237
now that I've raised my EQ...

19:01.273 --> 19:02.272
how about another date?

19:05.160 --> 19:07.110
Brandon, I asked you
to let me handle this.

19:07.145 --> 19:09.012
You can't just rip a
petition off the wall

19:09.047 --> 19:10.013
because you don't agree with it.

19:10.048 --> 19:11.114
No, but they can shut down my play

19:11.149 --> 19:12.148
if they don't agree with it?

19:12.184 --> 19:14.017
No one's shutting your play down.

19:14.052 --> 19:17.053
I expect you to
apologize to Sally Benton.

19:19.991 --> 19:20.990
All right.

19:21.026 --> 19:22.025
Good.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.343
Thank you.

19:23.395 --> 19:26.346
I have to say I understand
Brandon's frustration.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.998
He's worked so hard on
this. He's invested so much.

19:29.034 --> 19:31.301
This is his senior project
and now he can't put it on

19:31.336 --> 19:32.368
because a few kids object?

19:32.404 --> 19:34.287
Don't you think that's a bit extreme?

19:34.339 --> 19:36.272
Maybe, but I think we have to let

19:36.308 --> 19:38.291
the students decide this one.

19:38.326 --> 19:41.094
Sally and Brandon can make
their cases to the Honor Board.

19:51.256 --> 19:54.023
- Who is it?
- It's Callie.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.027
I really appreciate you coming.

19:58.063 --> 19:59.128
Of course.

20:05.952 --> 20:07.830
I wish I had somtehing
to offer you, but,

20:07.856 --> 20:09.806
- things are kind of tight.
- No, I don't need anything.

20:09.841 --> 20:11.874
I just wanted to make
sure that you're okay.

20:11.876 --> 20:14.444
You know, your message
got me really worried.

20:14.479 --> 20:16.879
Um... just having a hard time.

20:16.915 --> 20:19.716
I mean, obviously.
Look where I'm living.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.701
And who knows how long I
can even afford this dump

20:21.736 --> 20:22.785
now that I lost my job.

20:22.821 --> 20:26.622
- Wait, you...
- Yeah, I got let go for no reason.

20:26.658 --> 20:28.708
They said downsizing, but honestly,

20:28.743 --> 20:30.693
my boss didn't like
me because, you know,

20:30.729 --> 20:32.595
I was smarter than her

20:32.647 --> 20:34.614
and she felt threatened.

20:35.667 --> 20:36.799
I'm sorry.

20:36.835 --> 20:39.602
I'm trying to get severance
pay, but she's saying I quit,

20:39.604 --> 20:41.471
which means I can't get unemployment,

20:41.506 --> 20:42.505
so I'm totally screwed.

20:42.540 --> 20:44.440
I could end up on the street.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.476
And now my eczema's flaring up.

20:46.528 --> 20:48.411
I can't even afford my medicine.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.581
Look, I feel really bad.

20:51.599 --> 20:54.484
I ju... I don't know what I can do.

20:54.519 --> 20:55.485
Did you talk to my mom?

20:56.821 --> 20:57.754
Yeah.

20:58.823 --> 20:59.756
Did she care?

21:00.859 --> 21:03.393
Yeah, I'm sure she cares.
I think she's just...

21:03.428 --> 21:04.727
Cold selfish bitch.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.696
No, I think it's just hard for her.

21:06.748 --> 21:09.682
You know, she's said that you've
left messages like this before.

21:09.718 --> 21:11.651
She's a liar.

21:11.736 --> 21:14.637
How could I leave her a message
if I don't even have her number?

21:14.672 --> 21:17.540
If I call Girls United,
she refuses to talk to me.

21:17.575 --> 21:20.593
I mean, what kind of mom won't
even talk to her daughter?

21:22.564 --> 21:24.580
She could care less if
I ended up on the street.

21:25.583 --> 21:26.616
Or dead.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.519
Are you...

21:29.554 --> 21:31.554
are you planning on hurting yourself?

21:31.589 --> 21:33.890
No. I'm just...

21:35.827 --> 21:38.428
I need someone to help me.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.879
I... I have this
friend with an apartment

21:39.931 --> 21:41.481
and she'll rent me a room.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.466
I just need to come
up with first and last.

21:44.753 --> 21:45.802
$600...

21:45.854 --> 21:48.654
which isn't a lot of money to my mother.

21:49.741 --> 21:51.841
Do you think maybe you could, like...

21:51.843 --> 21:53.709
loan me some money?

21:53.745 --> 21:55.661
I mean, anything would help,
and I'll pay you back. I swear.

22:01.536 --> 22:03.503
Tough day at work?

22:04.622 --> 22:06.656
I know it's a school
night, but I think, uh,

22:06.691 --> 22:08.524
I think we deserve a cocktail.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.493
Well, I'm not gonna say no to that.

22:10.528 --> 22:12.478
Good, because riding
a desk is killing me.

22:13.581 --> 22:15.415
How was you day, my love?

22:15.450 --> 22:16.549
Oh, make it a double please.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.835
Oh, trust me, it already is.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.403
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

22:26.478 --> 22:28.811
- This tastes like it's been watered down.
- It's been watered down.

22:29.647 --> 22:32.615
- You don't think that one...
- Oh, my God, the kids are watering down the vodka.

22:33.868 --> 22:35.718
Should we get them together?

22:35.753 --> 22:37.753
Oh, no, no. I'm a cop.
I'm gonna dust for prints.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.655
Honey, you're not serious.

22:39.707 --> 22:40.690
I'm totally serious

22:40.725 --> 22:42.508
because I was looking
forward to this drink.

22:43.595 --> 22:44.644
Maybe it was your mom.

22:44.696 --> 22:45.895
You know how she likes her cocktails.

22:45.897 --> 22:48.514
Maybe she didn't want you to
know how much she was drinking.

22:48.550 --> 22:51.451
Wait, you think my mother
was sneaking liquor?

22:51.486 --> 22:52.702
That's weird.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.439
That's a good point.
Maybe it was my mother.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.375
I'll get it.

23:06.417 --> 23:08.417
Hey, I'm Gabe.

23:08.453 --> 23:09.819
He showed up at my worksite like this.

23:12.891 --> 23:13.840
What?

23:16.928 --> 23:19.629
He's fine. He's... he's in bed.

23:19.664 --> 23:20.830
I can get into a lot of
trouble doing what I just did

23:20.865 --> 23:22.665
just for taking him home.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.667
Yes. We, uh, we know

23:24.702 --> 23:26.602
that you're on the sex offenders list.

23:26.604 --> 23:28.604
- Oh...
- But we know why.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.506
I didn't know who Jesus was.

23:30.542 --> 23:33.493
All right? He lied to
me, he lied to my boss.

23:33.528 --> 23:34.644
He said he was 18.

23:34.679 --> 23:36.579
All right? When he
finally told me who he was,

23:36.614 --> 23:37.597
I told him to leave

23:37.649 --> 23:39.448
and don't come back.

23:39.450 --> 23:40.550
But obviously, that didn't stop him.

23:42.554 --> 23:45.454
If he keeps showing up
at the site like this,

23:45.490 --> 23:46.873
I'm gonna have to find another job,

23:46.925 --> 23:48.791
and this one was hard
enough for me to get.

23:48.826 --> 23:49.809
We're very sorry.

23:49.861 --> 23:51.794
Um, I'm... I'm sure it's tough.

23:52.897 --> 23:54.830
I made a mistake being with Ana.

23:54.866 --> 23:55.798
I know that.

23:55.889 --> 23:58.724
She was 15, I was 18,

23:58.759 --> 23:59.758
I was dealing drugs,

23:59.793 --> 24:01.793
made some really bad decisions.

24:01.845 --> 24:05.614
But we really did think
that we were in love.

24:05.666 --> 24:07.666
And I went to jail and I did my time.

24:07.735 --> 24:09.735
All right? But this list...

24:09.770 --> 24:11.687
it's a life sentence.

24:11.739 --> 24:15.674
I'm not some creep who goes
around and messes with kids.

24:15.709 --> 24:18.577
All right? I have been out
10 years, and I haven't gotten

24:18.579 --> 24:20.479
into any trouble,

24:20.514 --> 24:23.882
so you have got to keep
your son away from me.

24:24.918 --> 24:25.917
Please.

24:25.953 --> 24:27.452
Absolutely.

24:27.454 --> 24:28.553
We promise that we'll take care of it.

24:28.555 --> 24:30.856
Thank you so much for bringing him home.

24:35.896 --> 24:36.812
Hi.

24:39.483 --> 24:40.866
This is... this is Gabe.

24:44.772 --> 24:45.821
Hey.

24:45.873 --> 24:47.706
Hi.

24:57.101 --> 24:58.968
You have a problem, Jesus?

24:59.026 --> 25:00.796
I'm serious. Do you need to go to AA?

25:01.102 --> 25:02.234
No.

25:02.270 --> 25:04.203
Okay, because sneaking vodka
and watering down the bottle

25:04.238 --> 25:06.105
is alcoholic behavior to me.

25:06.140 --> 25:09.008
I'm pretty concerned
about you, young man.

25:09.043 --> 25:11.176
Just the... the way you've been acting.

25:11.212 --> 25:14.079
Going behind our backs
to find your birth father?

25:14.115 --> 25:17.449
Going to his worksite three times
even though he told you to stay away?

25:17.501 --> 25:19.435
- Okay!
- No, not okay!

25:19.487 --> 25:21.453
Not only are you putting
yourself in jeopardy,

25:21.489 --> 25:22.488
you're putting Gabe in a position

25:22.523 --> 25:24.423
where he could be arrested
and you're putting me

25:24.458 --> 25:28.260
in a really bad spot because
guess what? I'm a cop.

25:28.296 --> 25:31.196
Whether Gabe deserves to be
on that sex offenders list

25:31.232 --> 25:33.399
is another issue, but
the law is quite clear.

25:33.434 --> 25:36.368
You are a minor and he
cannot be anywhere near you.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.137
I'm sorry, okay?

25:38.172 --> 25:40.189
I... I get it. I'm
not gonna do it again.

25:40.241 --> 25:42.241
I don't think you do get it.

25:42.276 --> 25:44.276
Your birth father doesn't
want a relationship with you

25:44.312 --> 25:46.178
or with your sister, okay?

25:46.213 --> 25:48.247
And that sucks, but
that's the way it is.

25:48.282 --> 25:50.082
Life's a bitch sometimes.

25:50.151 --> 25:52.117
And on that note, you're
grounded indefinitely.

25:56.952 --> 25:59.335
Uh... Mom's been through a lot lately.

25:59.387 --> 26:00.937
I know you know that.

26:00.972 --> 26:03.273
But she's right. You need
to stay away from Gabe

26:03.308 --> 26:04.340
and you need to shape up.

26:30.135 --> 26:32.101
He's tall...

26:32.137 --> 26:33.136
like you.

26:44.416 --> 26:46.082
Okay, everybody.

26:46.117 --> 26:49.002
First thing, Mariana and I will
be recusing ourselves from voting

26:49.087 --> 26:51.971
since she's in the play and I am making

26:52.023 --> 26:53.323
the arguments against  R&J.

26:54.409 --> 26:56.175
Now, let's get started.

26:56.211 --> 26:58.394
Suicide is the second
leading cause of death

26:58.430 --> 27:01.164
for 15 to 25-year-olds.

27:01.199 --> 27:02.365
Why?

27:02.400 --> 27:06.135
Because young adults experience
strong, intense feelings

27:06.171 --> 27:10.223
of stress, of self-doubt,
of loneliness, of loss,

27:10.258 --> 27:12.175
of the pressure to succeed.

27:12.227 --> 27:15.161
In  Romeo and Juliet,
Shakespeare romanticizes

27:15.196 --> 27:17.180
suicide as a way for
two teenagers in love

27:17.215 --> 27:20.016
to be together forever in eternity.

27:20.051 --> 27:22.151
Romeo toasts, "Here's to my love,"

27:22.187 --> 27:24.053
as he drinks the poison that kills him.

27:24.105 --> 27:26.389
The poison that Juliet
calls "friendly drops"

27:26.424 --> 27:28.341
when she tries to
kiss them off his lips,

27:28.376 --> 27:31.294
but instead uses a "happy
dagger" to end her life.

27:32.364 --> 27:36.332
How is this idealization
of love and death

27:36.368 --> 27:38.451
a good message to send teenagers?

27:38.503 --> 27:41.270
Thank you. Brandon?

27:52.200 --> 27:57.053
Forbidding the performance of
a classic piece of literature

27:57.088 --> 27:59.956
because it might in and of itself

28:00.008 --> 28:03.076
trigger someone to kill
themself* is not only ridiculous,

28:03.111 --> 28:05.928
but it's one small step
away from banning books.

28:05.964 --> 28:08.981
And let's talk about this idea
that Shakespeare's romanticizing

28:09.034 --> 28:11.034
suicide in  Romeo and Juliet.

28:11.069 --> 28:13.336
He's not even romanticizing
their relationship.

28:14.472 --> 28:17.940
I used to think that
R&J  was about true love.

28:17.976 --> 28:18.975
It's not.

28:19.010 --> 28:24.297
It's about two rebellious,
impulsive teenagers

28:24.349 --> 28:26.282
making really bad choices.

28:28.186 --> 28:31.354
And... and this suicide
pact at the end, it...

28:31.389 --> 28:36.159
it's not portrayed as this
ultimate act of true love.

28:36.194 --> 28:38.144
It's portrayed as a tragic act

28:38.179 --> 28:41.130
taken by two screwed up kids

28:41.166 --> 28:44.067
who dismiss the value of their lives.

28:45.170 --> 28:49.005
Which is why the last
line in the play isn't,

28:49.040 --> 28:52.058
"They killed themselves and
lived happily ever after."

28:52.110 --> 28:54.043
No.

28:54.079 --> 28:57.013
It's, "For never was a story of more woe

28:57.048 --> 29:00.016
than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

29:13.214 --> 29:15.298
Okay, so we've heard both sides

29:15.333 --> 29:18.151
and it's time for the
Honor Board to vote.

29:18.203 --> 29:20.236
Those in favor of
staging Romeo and Juliet,

29:20.271 --> 29:21.304
raise your hands.

29:23.174 --> 29:25.108
Okay. And against?

29:36.418 --> 29:37.118
_

30:02.789 --> 30:04.408
Brandon, I'm so sorry.

30:04.414 --> 30:06.297
I know how hard you worked.

30:06.299 --> 30:10.134
Um, okay, uh... what if
we do it somewhere else?

30:10.170 --> 30:11.235
Off campus.

30:11.271 --> 30:13.104
They can't stop us from
doing that, can they?

30:13.106 --> 30:14.138
No.

30:14.174 --> 30:16.140
And can it still count
as our senior project?

30:16.176 --> 30:18.226
Well, other students are doing
their projects off campus,

30:18.261 --> 30:20.078
so yeah, it definitely could.

30:20.113 --> 30:22.113
- Okay.
- But where?

30:22.148 --> 30:24.132
Well, we need a theater or a big space,

30:24.184 --> 30:26.117
but we don't have the money
to rent something like that.

30:26.152 --> 30:28.152
Plus, without all the
lights and the soundboard

30:28.188 --> 30:31.355
we have here at school,
well, it's, like...

30:31.391 --> 30:32.356
impossible.

30:33.423 --> 30:34.972
Brandon, I am so sorry.

30:35.008 --> 30:36.341
Thanks, Mom.

30:36.393 --> 30:38.192
Hey, Mat, wait up.

30:39.329 --> 30:41.329
Hey, I'm sorry.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.214
Yeah, me too.

30:44.300 --> 30:45.316
So you still want to hang out?

30:45.368 --> 30:49.270
Um... not really in the mood.

30:49.305 --> 30:51.172
Well, let me try to cheer you up.

30:52.436 --> 30:55.420
I don't see why I have to
go to some class for losers!

30:55.456 --> 30:57.389
Because you've been acting
like one, that's why.

30:57.424 --> 30:59.424
- This is so unfair!
- No, it's not!

30:59.460 --> 31:01.393
Listen, I understand
that you're disappointed

31:01.428 --> 31:02.527
and upset about Flintwood and wrestling

31:02.563 --> 31:04.413
and your birth father,
but do you know what?

31:04.448 --> 31:07.332
You have not been
responding appropriately.

31:07.368 --> 31:09.401
- This is bull.
- No, it's tough love!

31:09.436 --> 31:11.236
You know what? Go get ready

31:11.238 --> 31:12.404
before I kick your ass, and
don't think that I won't.

31:18.362 --> 31:19.644
What is going on?

31:19.680 --> 31:21.413
They have not been able
to find a replacement

31:21.415 --> 31:23.682
teacher for me, so I'm taking our
little hoodlum with me to class tonight

31:23.717 --> 31:25.233
so that he can see what his future is

31:25.285 --> 31:26.618
if he doesn't straighten himself out.

31:26.653 --> 31:27.652
Okay, I wasn't gonna say anything,

31:27.705 --> 31:29.638
but you are being way too hard on him.

31:29.673 --> 31:32.224
Telling him that his birth father
doesn't want anything to do with him?

31:32.276 --> 31:33.558
Telling him that life's a bitch?

31:33.610 --> 31:34.626
Yeah, well, that's reality.

31:34.661 --> 31:35.627
His or yours?

31:37.548 --> 31:39.631
I realize you're having a rough time

31:39.666 --> 31:42.534
with the mastectomy, with
having to ride a desk at work,

31:42.586 --> 31:45.520
but Jesus is not the only one
who's not responding appropriately.

31:46.607 --> 31:48.440
And that's not coming
from a critical place.

31:48.475 --> 31:49.541
It's coming from a place of tough love.

31:59.420 --> 32:00.469
It's one of my dad's warehouses.

32:05.325 --> 32:07.209
What are we doing here?

32:07.261 --> 32:10.228
Teaching you to hoverboard.

32:11.265 --> 32:13.315
Hm, okay.

32:13.367 --> 32:16.301
You ever, uh, ride one of these things?

32:16.336 --> 32:18.303
Please.

32:18.338 --> 32:20.689
What? Okay.

32:20.741 --> 32:22.624
Okay.

32:22.659 --> 32:24.659
Damn, girl.

32:24.711 --> 32:27.646
Wow. Well, maybe you can teach
me how to hoverboard then.

32:27.681 --> 32:29.681
How's that?

32:30.751 --> 32:32.651
Hey, check out the acoustics.

32:32.686 --> 32:34.503
Hello!

32:35.639 --> 32:37.606
Hey, you should sing something.

32:37.658 --> 32:39.574
From your play.

32:39.610 --> 32:40.692
From  R&J?

32:40.727 --> 32:43.428
For real. I wanna hear you sing.

32:44.515 --> 32:45.664
- Nuh-uh.
- Uh-huh.

32:45.699 --> 32:47.566
- Nuh-uh.
- Uh-huh.

32:50.537 --> 32:51.503
Okay.

32:53.390 --> 32:56.358
♪ This love could be great ♪

32:56.410 --> 32:59.327
♪ But they say it would be wrong ♪

32:59.363 --> 33:02.481
♪ I don't care 'cause I'd be lost ♪

33:02.516 --> 33:05.417
♪ Without you ♪

33:07.337 --> 33:09.221
What if...

33:09.223 --> 33:10.355
you do the whole play here?

33:10.390 --> 33:12.290
Are you serious?

33:12.326 --> 33:14.326
I mean, I know my dad will say yes.

33:14.361 --> 33:17.329
It's one of the perks of
being, uh, kind of spoiled.

33:17.364 --> 33:19.598
Oh, my God, you're...

33:19.633 --> 33:21.283
you're totally my hero!

33:43.524 --> 33:45.457
Callie?

33:45.492 --> 33:47.459
Callie, are you there?

33:47.494 --> 33:49.461
This is Chloe.

33:49.496 --> 33:51.446
I did something bad.

33:53.534 --> 33:55.467
Say goodbye for me.

34:33.070 --> 34:35.159
"Emotional Intelligence
is a wide range of skills

34:35.212 --> 34:37.228
that young people can
develop and improve."

34:39.150 --> 34:42.951
"These skills are critical for emotional
well-being and success in life."

34:50.027 --> 34:52.928
The thing is that, uh,
emotional intelligence

34:52.963 --> 34:54.096
isn't something that, uh,

34:54.098 --> 34:56.831
just young people need to work on,

34:56.867 --> 34:58.834
just you need to work on.

34:58.869 --> 34:59.968
Everyone, myself included,

35:00.004 --> 35:01.887
needs to figure out a way to identify

35:01.939 --> 35:03.906
what we're feeling so we
know what to do with it.

35:06.043 --> 35:07.876
I had something really bad happen to me,

35:07.912 --> 35:08.944
and I have been angry

35:08.979 --> 35:10.179
and keeping it inside.

35:10.214 --> 35:12.247
I...

35:12.249 --> 35:15.150
I had cancer and I had to have
both of my breasts removed.

35:16.253 --> 35:17.236
These are just pads.

35:18.822 --> 35:21.173
And so, Javier, when you
threw away the hummus...

35:22.209 --> 35:25.160
I overreacted by throwing you out.

35:26.230 --> 35:27.162
So...

35:28.849 --> 35:31.200
I know that all of you have had
something bad happen to you...

35:33.037 --> 35:36.038
and you've been hurt,
disappointed, and angry,

35:36.073 --> 35:38.140
and you probably haven't
reacted in the smartest of ways.

35:41.078 --> 35:43.011
But that's why we're all here.

35:43.047 --> 35:44.012
All of us.

35:44.014 --> 35:50.002
To help each other
become more self-aware,

35:50.087 --> 35:52.955
and learn to express
ourselves in healthier ways.

35:52.990 --> 35:57.826
So, when Javier suggested that
I write "tits" on the board

35:57.878 --> 36:00.896
as one of my positive attributes,

36:00.931 --> 36:02.864
how could I have reacted better?

36:04.902 --> 36:06.752
- With humor.
- Absolutely.

36:06.804 --> 36:07.803
I could have made a joke.

36:09.940 --> 36:11.240
You could have told me
I hurt your feelings.

36:15.279 --> 36:16.211
I could have.

36:18.182 --> 36:19.181
Thank you, Javier.

37:01.091 --> 37:03.809
I never thought she'd actually do it.

37:06.830 --> 37:07.963
I know.

37:07.998 --> 37:09.915
You were right, Cal, you know.

37:09.967 --> 37:11.750
I should've listened to you.

37:11.802 --> 37:14.202
I... I should have taken
her threats more seriously.

37:14.238 --> 37:15.837
No, I get why you didn't.

37:17.875 --> 37:20.225
After hearing her cry
wolf so many times...

37:21.912 --> 37:24.146
I'm really sorry that you
were involved in all this.

37:24.164 --> 37:25.197
Really, I'm sorry.

37:25.249 --> 37:26.214
Don't be.

37:26.250 --> 37:27.249
I'm sorry.

37:27.284 --> 37:30.085
I'm so sorry for what I said to you.

37:31.271 --> 37:33.138
Thank God she's gonna be okay.

37:35.159 --> 37:38.193
I... I don't think she
really wanted to kill herself.

37:38.228 --> 37:39.227
I mean, she called me.

37:39.263 --> 37:41.029
You know, she must have figured

37:41.065 --> 37:42.147
that I would get the message sooner

37:42.199 --> 37:44.032
and send someone to save her, you know?

37:45.135 --> 37:46.168
For the first time in my life,

37:46.170 --> 37:48.970
when I walked into that hospital room,

37:48.972 --> 37:50.972
when she said she wanted help...

37:52.960 --> 37:55.010
when she said she needed me...

37:55.045 --> 37:56.011
she meant it.

37:57.948 --> 38:00.916
Maybe she was trying to get
my attention, but I think...

38:00.951 --> 38:02.918
I think this time, she
got her own attention.

38:04.121 --> 38:07.806
So now...

38:09.810 --> 38:10.892
now we're gonna go to counseling

38:10.928 --> 38:12.828
to try to figure out what the hell to do

38:12.863 --> 38:15.797
with all these awful,
messy feelings, you know?

38:16.834 --> 38:18.767
I think...

38:18.769 --> 38:20.936
I hope...

38:20.938 --> 38:22.754
that this is the moment

38:22.790 --> 38:24.206
where it all starts to change for her.

38:28.245 --> 38:29.778
Thank you.

38:31.231 --> 38:33.882
Listen, I know that I'm stubborn.

38:33.917 --> 38:36.818
I know that I'm really
opinionated, and so are you.

38:36.854 --> 38:40.122
And hey, abut that foster care bill,

38:40.157 --> 38:42.157
listen, we're gonna have
to agree to disagree.

38:43.827 --> 38:47.229
But know, know that even when
I disagree with you, Callie,

38:47.264 --> 38:49.147
I am so proud

38:49.183 --> 38:52.067
of the amazing young
woman that you're becoming.

39:10.170 --> 39:11.136
Hey.

39:14.091 --> 39:15.157
I heard about what happened.

39:16.994 --> 39:18.093
Do you want to talk about it?

39:20.130 --> 39:21.163
That's cool.

39:24.968 --> 39:27.102
Do you mind if I just
sit there with you?

40:21.909 --> 40:23.859
Don't worry. We're doing it off campus.

40:23.861 --> 40:25.861
And you don't have to come.

40:31.919 --> 40:33.869
Hey, uh, can I talk to you?

40:37.875 --> 40:38.874
Come in.

40:46.884 --> 40:48.016
What is it, Sally? What happened?

40:49.937 --> 40:50.969
I...

40:52.022 --> 40:53.855
uh...

40:53.891 --> 40:55.857
Sorry, I'm...

40:55.893 --> 40:56.858
I don't know how, um...

40:56.894 --> 40:58.026
It's really hard for me to say this.

40:58.061 --> 40:59.778
Um...

41:05.302 --> 41:06.902
Monte kissed me.
