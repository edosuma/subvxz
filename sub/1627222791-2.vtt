WEBVTT

00:20.320 --> 00:22.280
I've seen so much blood.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.760
What are you going
to do about it?

00:23.800 --> 00:26.080
I'm gonna kill the General,
and you're gonna help me.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.880
Oh, no.

00:29.480 --> 00:33.000
We don't need you.
We don't want you.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.840
The gods are dead.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.480
Queen Antedia,
you could feed us to your pigs.

00:45.560 --> 00:49.040
Who will give me
three silver pieces?

00:49.080 --> 00:53.240
There'll come a day in the future
when I'll call upon you.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.960
Behold!

00:56.000 --> 01:01.160
From this day forward
you are... Quant.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.280
Excellent.

01:04.520 --> 01:07.760
I've come to make you an offer.
In exchange for what?

01:07.800 --> 01:11.400
The girl.
Lokka is angry.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.200
Where is she?
It takes time.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.720
We don't have time.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.280
Let us feast.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.240
Tell me, child.
Why did you really come here?

01:24.280 --> 01:26.760
Fuck the gods.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.600
Get back!

02:46.400 --> 02:48.240
That...

02:51.200 --> 02:53.120
That...

03:10.560 --> 03:12.560
And...

03:25.800 --> 03:29.720
♪ Well you can bump and grind

03:29.760 --> 03:33.040
♪ It is good for your mind

03:33.080 --> 03:38.720

♪ Wow ♪

04:28.440 --> 04:30.880
Are you ready
to say sorry?

04:32.760 --> 04:35.480
You can't spend all day
down there. You'll perish.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.880
And you'll catch...
everything.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.440
Look, I know he's a bastard.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.280
We all are, but...

04:45.320 --> 04:48.520
Please, just...
just say you're sorry.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.240
Your Majesty.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.000
I was by the chalk place
this morning. Saw something.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.520
What?
Something strange.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.120
How strange?
Very strange.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.600
What was it?

05:39.640 --> 05:42.320
A dragon.
How big?

05:42.360 --> 05:44.760
Don't humour him.
You're being an arse.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.120
What, breathing fire?

05:47.160 --> 05:51.240
All right. Describe
what happened word for word.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.240
50 feet long.

05:55.280 --> 05:59.400
Sage-coloured flanks,
mustardy wings with purple veins,

05:59.440 --> 06:02.320
claws big as icicles.

06:02.360 --> 06:06.440
She turns to me,
opens her scaly maw,

06:06.480 --> 06:08.720
breathes a giant plume
of orange fire,

06:08.760 --> 06:11.680
roughly the size of a medium
to large haystack.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.120
That's not nice.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.360
Something funny?

06:17.400 --> 06:19.520
Oi, you!

06:19.560 --> 06:21.240
What's so funny?
Yes?

06:21.280 --> 06:23.680
What's so funny witch?
Nothing. Nothing, sorry.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.000
Do you want back down
the drop, eh?

06:25.040 --> 06:28.160
Do you want back down the drop?
No, sir.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.520
Tania.
-No, master.
-Louder!

06:30.560 --> 06:33.680
No, Master.
Five silver pieces.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.680
Too much by thrice.
Can't clean, talks back.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.240
Tell her, pitch the roof.
Back to the market...

06:40.280 --> 06:44.360
..buy an hog, feed her to it.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.000
Eat the fucking hog.
Who's in?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.480
I'm in.

06:48.520 --> 06:52.080
I promise Master,
I will never talk back again.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.560
Before I forget...

07:08.800 --> 07:11.480
What's that?
Weasels.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.920
Found a romp of them up river.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.720
You want me to kill 'em?
No.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.080
I want you to teach 'em to sing
and dance in a line.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.320
I'm a weasel. I'm a weasel.
I'm a weasel. I'm a weasel.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.160
Weasels stock gives me wind.
What was that?

07:31.360 --> 07:33.600
Nothing.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.960
You want to watch
yourself there, brother.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.320
You watch yourself.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.560
Yeah, you're right, Mum.
He is a choosy bastard.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.080
You... Witch!

08:25.600 --> 08:29.400
My name is Blaine.
I'm an associate of the General.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.120
Sorry, I don't know
what that means.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.280
My Lady...

08:35.320 --> 08:37.520
The witch.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.560
Oh...

08:41.920 --> 08:43.920
Tell me about the girl.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.400
What the hell.
It is written here.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.800
The name is?
Fuck the Gods.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.960
How is he?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
The fever has worsened.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.840
We need to talk.
What about?

10:57.880 --> 11:00.280
Thrilled as I am
by your unexpected arrival

11:00.320 --> 11:02.720
and conscious of the reasons
for your lengthy trip.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.200
Reasons?
There's only one reason I'm here.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.640
I'm general of this legion.

11:07.680 --> 11:10.600
The legion has its own rules,
and crucially, crucially,

11:10.640 --> 11:12.800
it has its own fucking dogs.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.920
So?
So you can't just waltz in here

11:15.960 --> 11:18.160
and eat my right hand man.
Your right hand man

11:18.200 --> 11:20.640
was about to have you murdered.
Yes, I know.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.480
I knew that before he did.
You know, I wasn't born yesterday.

11:23.520 --> 11:26.080
I didn't just crawl out
from under a stone.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.840
I'm Aulus "fucking" Plautius.
Then, where is she?

11:29.880 --> 11:33.200
20 moons,
and not a fucking clue.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.200
That is Aulus Plautius.

11:36.240 --> 11:40.840
An empty suit of armour,
a put on, wash out, no-show.

11:40.880 --> 11:46.240
A vain, preening, disappointing,
flabby, floppy failure.

11:54.040 --> 11:59.200
The girl had a sister, Islene.
She died in the invasion.

11:59.240 --> 12:05.040
The witch says if the sister asked
her to do something, she will do it.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.600
So?

12:06.640 --> 12:09.720
So, we want you to go
and talk to her.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.120
What?

12:11.160 --> 12:13.360
Um, she's dead.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.480
Oh!
Oh, yes. Oh...

12:21.520 --> 12:24.320
One tiny little detail
you left out, darling.

12:24.360 --> 12:28.040
But you visited their dead.
Fucking bigmouthed witch!

12:28.080 --> 12:30.680
She said she took you there.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.520
Didn't feel like
mentioning that? Mm.

12:33.560 --> 12:37.400
What else aren't you telling me?

12:37.440 --> 12:41.280
So what are you gonna do?
Don't you worry about that.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.920
You tell me.
You know I love you, my darling,

12:44.960 --> 12:47.160
but you underestimate me
at your peril.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.000
Come now.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.400
Well, I'll go to the underworld
and I'll speak to the sister.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.480
But if we are going
to work together,

12:58.520 --> 13:01.640
there has to be
some ground rules.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.520
Well, come on.
One...

13:03.560 --> 13:06.880
You don't eat anyone
without my say-so.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.040
-Agreed.
-Two... If we're gonna work
together, no secrets.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.040
I'll tell you what I know,
you do the same.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.320
Agreed.
Three...

13:17.840 --> 13:20.040
This cock. Get rid.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.720
Want to be able to speak
to my wife alone.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.200
Blaine is my close advisor.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.400
He's a ponce.
He's beloved of Lokka.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.440
He is a cunt.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.640
Blaine, darling...
High priestess...

13:31.680 --> 13:34.160
Fuck off for a bit.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.880
High priestess...

13:36.920 --> 13:39.360
You weren't so fussy last night.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.440
Where was I?

13:42.480 --> 13:44.920
Four.
Four...

13:44.960 --> 13:47.560
The Celtic Queen.
-Your whore.
-Asset.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.440
Bet she's got a guilty one.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.720
Amena is valuable to me
and I want to keep it that way.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.240
Can I fuck her?
She's fun.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.640
Well, let's put a pin in that
for now.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.920
But just leave her alone.
And you don't speak to her,

13:59.960 --> 14:02.880
you don't let jolly boy
speak to her, you understand?

14:05.720 --> 14:09.760
I don't remember you being
this tense in Rome.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.200
Just relax.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.040
I'm only here for one reason.

14:19.080 --> 14:22.280
I won't be wasting my time
on local colour.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.360
Twopenny scrubbers
don't know the shit they're in.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.400
Besides...

14:27.440 --> 14:30.920
Lokka's thirst
for the sacrament of flesh...

14:30.960 --> 14:33.400
has been well sated.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.560
For now.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.560
She's on to you.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.120
What did you say?
Come on,

14:56.160 --> 14:59.400
you're sharper than that.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.560
But not that sharp, eh?

15:02.520 --> 15:04.160
What are you insinuating?

15:04.200 --> 15:09.120
Oh, "insinuating."
Oh, that's a big word.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.400
I'm in-si-nu-ating

15:12.440 --> 15:14.480
that, whatever your plan is,

15:14.520 --> 15:17.760
tethered up that sleeve,
it needs work.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.320
Seriously...

15:19.360 --> 15:21.960
You need to use the whole brain.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.120
What of that cunny cunt
cunning in there?

15:25.160 --> 15:28.800
Dream up something...
a smidge smarter,

15:28.840 --> 15:30.560
teeny bit more brilliant.

15:30.600 --> 15:35.480
But do it fast,
because he may buy more of this.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.600
But she doesn't.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.840
Nice bum.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.120
That bum.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.280
Yummy bum.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.760
Thirsty?

16:25.440 --> 16:28.520
You wasn't really a queen,
was you?

16:28.560 --> 16:30.600
You mean, did I have...

16:31.720 --> 16:34.960
treasures? A throne?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.600
Loyal subjects...
once upon a time?

16:38.640 --> 16:41.760
Um, I don't believe you.
So...

16:41.800 --> 16:44.600
These days,
I hardly believe it myself.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.760
Was you, was you married?

16:50.160 --> 16:53.600
Mm.
What happened to him?

16:53.640 --> 16:55.720
He died...

16:55.760 --> 16:57.880
in battle.

17:00.840 --> 17:05.080
If you married again,

17:05.120 --> 17:08.600
that man, would he be king?

17:08.640 --> 17:12.240
He would indeed.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.360
Would he have his own horse?

17:14.400 --> 17:17.760
He'd have a hundred horses...

17:17.800 --> 17:19.800
ships...

17:21.360 --> 17:22.920
gold...

17:22.960 --> 17:26.320
and he wouldn't eat weasel stew.

17:26.360 --> 17:28.720
He'd eat swan.

17:28.760 --> 17:31.480
Swan?
With all the trimmings.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.880
It would be best
if you get some sleep, yeah.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.400
Good night, Brooke.
Good night, then.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.560
Good night, Mum.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.560
Behold!

18:23.400 --> 18:26.280
So, what do you think?
Is he gonna make it?

18:26.320 --> 18:29.360
I'm just saying.
It's a pretty deep wound.

18:29.400 --> 18:33.000
Listen, Quant,
we have a prophecy.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.120
And if you knew the first thing
about the prophecy,

18:35.160 --> 18:38.840
You'd know
the Veran doesn't die

18:38.880 --> 18:42.520
The Veran lives for another...

18:42.560 --> 18:43.960
What the fuck...

18:44.000 --> 18:47.680
Forget it. Forget it.
I'm not even going to.

18:47.720 --> 18:51.520
Does the prophecy say
the chosen one pitches up

18:51.560 --> 18:53.760
and cuts the Veran's throat...

18:53.800 --> 18:55.840
and then does one...

18:55.880 --> 18:57.880
to who knows where.

is the egg under?

21:22.280 --> 21:23.720
Are you sure.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.520
OK, I'm sorry, Sir.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.960
You've lost again.
Anyone else like a go?

21:31.320 --> 21:33.320
Let's make some money.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.040
Dip, dip, blue ship,
who is it?

21:41.080 --> 21:43.640
Is it you?

21:43.680 --> 21:46.640
Dip, dip, sky blue,
who is it? Not you.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.360
Dip, dip, sky blue,
who is it?

21:50.360 --> 21:52.960
Centurion Viticus!

21:53.000 --> 21:55.080
Hey, hey!

21:55.120 --> 21:57.600
Attention!

21:57.640 --> 22:01.240
General. Since we arrived here,
you've shown great courage,

22:01.280 --> 22:03.560
guile, grit, guts!

22:03.600 --> 22:07.240
So, congratulations.
You're my new Praefectus.

22:08.520 --> 22:12.920
Um, what happened to Vitus?

22:12.960 --> 22:16.200
Um, yes. Well, he was
summoned back to Rome.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.800
Short notice.

22:18.840 --> 22:23.120
-I'm Praefectus?
-Well, you see,
you put the hours in, pays off.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.160
I will die for
the glory of the knight.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.440
Well, I don't doubt it.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.960
So keep an eye on which cup
the egg is under.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.760
Which one is it?
I'm done with you.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.200
Come on, lads.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.200
I've got one more trick for you,
ladies and gentlemen.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.000
I'm going to need a volunteer.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.400
Come on. You look like
you like a bit of fun.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.760
Who's feeling adventurous?
Up you go.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.440
Nobody? Oh, hello.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.480
Big round
of applause for my friend.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.200
Have I got a surprise for you.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.680
-Have you met my friend?
-What?
I'd like you to look

23:05.720 --> 23:09.760
very, very closely.

23:09.800 --> 23:13.680
That's it.
Look very closely.

23:13.720 --> 23:20.400
That's it. Is she the fairest
maiden your eyes have ever seen?

23:20.440 --> 23:23.600
Yes, she is.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.040
You're in luck.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.720
For she seeks a husband
this very night.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.200
Are you an honourable
suitor, sir?

23:33.240 --> 23:37.040
Oh, I am.

23:38.080 --> 23:42.840
Now, do you take this chicken

23:42.880 --> 23:44.840
to be your wife?

23:47.000 --> 23:50.440
I do.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.840
That's enough.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.960
Thank you very much.
Excellent. Thank you.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.720
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Cheers.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.200
Here.

24:16.240 --> 24:18.320
I'm not hungry.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.160
You blame yourself?

24:27.200 --> 24:29.080
No, I don't.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.040
Everybody else does.
So I don't have to.

24:32.080 --> 24:33.920
They've got it covered.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.840
What they forget is

24:35.880 --> 24:38.160
while they're all hiding
and wringing their hands,

24:38.200 --> 24:40.360
and dancing, and fucking about,

24:40.400 --> 24:42.760
I was out there
working my balls off.

24:42.800 --> 24:46.040
I took a tiny, foolish,
speck of a girl,

24:46.080 --> 24:48.680
and I make her into a...

24:48.720 --> 24:50.800
It's true.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.840
Nobody spent that time with her.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.400
They can say and think
what they want.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.280
Only you truly know her.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.320
And her heart.

25:02.120 --> 25:05.680
So tell me, has she deserted us?

25:05.720 --> 25:08.320
Do we need a new sign?

26:22.240 --> 26:24.880
Where's you going?
Badgering.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.560
Get us a stoat.
Get your own.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.280
Majesty.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.880
Stay there.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.920
Hello, missy.

27:39.160 --> 27:42.080
The money from your little show.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.880
It's mine.
I don't think so.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.480
Give me the money.
It's hers.

27:47.520 --> 27:49.240
She earned it.
Fuck off.

27:52.640 --> 27:58.560
That's it. Now turn around
and walk away with both balls.

28:05.880 --> 28:09.840
Seems I'm surplus to requirements.
Hmm, seems so.

28:12.200 --> 28:15.400
Well, goodbye.

28:17.640 --> 28:20.880
You hungry?
Not particularly.

28:20.920 --> 28:25.840
Come on. I've had a good day.
I've had a shit day.

28:25.880 --> 28:29.920
Is that wine?
It's also shit.

28:29.960 --> 28:34.160
Swap you a leg for some shit wine,
but you have to pluck the rest.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.120
So...

28:38.160 --> 28:40.080
you do need my help.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.200
Don't push it.

28:43.480 --> 28:46.760
It's a moon tree.
Moon what?

28:46.800 --> 28:49.360
Moon tree.
They come out at night

28:49.400 --> 28:52.240
and only appear
after one moon in 12.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.720
Put it in weasel stew.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.560
It will make it taste
like the finest swan.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.240
Fit for a king.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.920
You'll find them in the forest.
I need two dozen.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.600
No, I can't.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.720
Rork likes his weasel stew
done in a certain way.

29:08.760 --> 29:12.960
The way that mum does it.
Trust me. He'll love it.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.920
Mum, too.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
A king?

29:19.040 --> 29:21.800
With a hundred horses.

29:31.800 --> 29:35.200
Where are you from?
Me? All over.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.960
Doing what?
You name it.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.520
Musician, carpenter, soldier,
beggar, salt farmer, fireman,

29:43.560 --> 29:46.560
goatherd...
Wait, you were a salt farmer?

29:46.600 --> 29:49.760
Many, many moons ago.

29:49.800 --> 29:54.880
And I can tell you,
that is a shit job.

29:54.920 --> 29:58.080
My dad was a salt farmer.
Was he?

29:58.120 --> 30:01.600
Well, he must be
a better man than me.

30:01.640 --> 30:03.280
Or a total fool.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.360
I couldn't hack it.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.280
Hard, hard ground.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.600
He still at it?

30:14.520 --> 30:16.640
I don't know.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.040
My name is Lucius.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.280
Cait.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.200
And then my mother died,

30:41.240 --> 30:43.680
and we moved west
to live with my uncle.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.600
He's a bit like you,
been everywhere, done everything.

30:46.640 --> 30:50.280
Legion?
Hmm. Exactly. Decrepit.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.240
And he knew of its conjuring.

30:52.280 --> 30:56.080
And he showed me
great stuff and...

30:56.120 --> 30:58.280
Amazing stuff.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.800
And then the invasion happened.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.720
And I've been escaping
ever since.

31:04.760 --> 31:07.160
Then you came along
and interrupted it all.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.200
The end.

31:11.920 --> 31:15.960
You know, when you go
around the world

31:16.000 --> 31:19.080
and see as much as I have,
you learn a lot.

31:19.120 --> 31:24.320
And one of the things you learn...
is to spot a lie.

31:24.360 --> 31:29.200
And I can tell you, that I think
every word you've just told me,

31:29.240 --> 31:30.920
with the exception
of the bit about

31:30.960 --> 31:33.680
growing up on a salt farm
and your name,

31:33.720 --> 31:37.120
is 100% copper-bottomed,

31:37.160 --> 31:39.800
ocean-going bullshit.

31:41.680 --> 31:44.640
Listen, you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

31:44.680 --> 31:48.440
Most of people's lives
are just stories anyway.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.280
Well, I guess I'll have
-to work on it.
-Well, you have time.

31:51.320 --> 31:54.680
You haven't.
Fuck off.

31:54.720 --> 31:58.320
Anyway, I don't mind.
I like a good yarn.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.520
Here's a good game.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.160
I'll tell you a story.

32:07.200 --> 32:10.320
And you have to tell me
if it's true

32:10.360 --> 32:13.080
or bullshit. Agreed?

32:13.120 --> 32:15.400
Agreed.

32:15.440 --> 32:19.520
If I told you,
among all the jobs I've done,

32:19.560 --> 32:22.400
that one was a soldier.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.280
Well, I was a soldier.

32:27.760 --> 32:31.160
A Roman soldier.

32:31.200 --> 32:34.560
I joined the Legion as a boy
and I went all over.

32:34.600 --> 32:39.440
This one time, we were guarding
some temple. Jerusalem.

32:39.480 --> 32:42.240
We'd rounded up a bunch
of troublemakers.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.880
They called themselves messiahs.

32:44.920 --> 32:48.320
They grow them down there
like corn.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.720
Anyway, the rule
was we'd crucify them

32:50.760 --> 32:53.640
for a couple of days,
to show they were nothing special.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.720
This one...

32:55.760 --> 32:59.440
he'd been up there all day,
sun frying his brain.

32:59.480 --> 33:02.800
My officer suggested
I finish him off.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.920
Do him a favour.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.720
So I did.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.760
I took his spear

33:20.360 --> 33:23.760
and I pushed it
through his heart.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.560
Only...

33:26.600 --> 33:30.480
it felt like I was
the one being stabbed.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.920
And I stood holding the spear.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.480
And for a few seconds...

33:35.520 --> 33:40.400
my heart choked
on its own blood.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.680
So I look up...

33:42.720 --> 33:46.480
and he's glowing.

33:46.520 --> 33:50.040
All I see is light.

33:53.160 --> 33:55.160
I laughed it off.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.120
I got pissed for three days.

34:01.160 --> 34:05.840
And then I'm walking through
some market and...

34:05.880 --> 34:09.360
I see the man I killed.

34:09.400 --> 34:12.600
And he looked at me.

34:12.640 --> 34:16.280
And he knew who I was.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.480
I know who you are, too.

34:21.680 --> 34:24.760
It was you.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.800
You did it.
Cait, listen to me.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.960
I went to your home,
I met your father.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
No. No.
He told me all about you.

34:34.040 --> 34:37.760
Your sister's name was Islene.
No. I'm a fucking idiot.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.120
Idiot.

34:39.160 --> 34:43.720
I know who you are and I need
you to listen very carefully.

34:43.760 --> 34:47.920
I have something for you.
Something very, very important.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.800
Away from me!
Cait!

34:51.360 --> 34:55.000
You can't escape this.
None of us can!

35:01.800 --> 35:03.560
Cait!

35:04.640 --> 35:06.640
Cait!

35:18.080 --> 35:20.120
Fuck.

35:28.080 --> 35:30.080
Oh, good evening,
Your Majesty.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.840
Good evening.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.880
I'm Viticus, the new Praefectus.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.680
And?
I'm replacing Vitus.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.880
He had to go back to Rome
on short notice.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.040
I heard.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.080
The General has asked
to see you in his quarters.

35:46.320 --> 35:48.960
Sorry.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.760
I'll leave you to your asset.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.320
Good evening, Your Majesty.

36:03.360 --> 36:06.080
Good evening.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.520
There you are.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.560
Drink?

36:11.680 --> 36:14.920
I thought we should have
a little chat.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.240
About the other night.
You don't have to say anything.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.560
What?
I loved it.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.920
What?

36:22.960 --> 36:26.080
Every minute.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.600
-Really?
-I want
to know all about your master.

36:31.680 --> 36:34.360
I want to know everything.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.800
Mmm.

36:51.840 --> 36:55.880
Was coming back from market.
Saw something strange.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.640
What?

36:57.680 --> 37:00.480
Roman.

37:00.520 --> 37:03.000
Well...
It weren't a Roman.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.440
It was.
It wasn't a Roman, it was a tree?

37:05.480 --> 37:08.640
It had a sword and a shield.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.600
And leaves and branches.
No Romans up here.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.200
There is now.
Is it nice?

37:13.240 --> 37:15.080
I saw it with my own eyes.

37:15.120 --> 37:18.480
And six mugs of cider.
Look. Romans...

37:18.520 --> 37:20.440
Hey, we're talking.
Shut the fuck up.

37:20.480 --> 37:23.080
-Sorry, Brother.
-Yeah.
How about...

37:25.400 --> 37:29.200
What's this?
Those are moon trees.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.760
What?
Moon tree.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.760
They make weasel stew
taste like swan.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.640
What the fuck
are you talking about?

37:37.680 --> 37:41.200
It's fit for a king
with a hundred horses.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.720
Where did you find them?
The forest.

37:47.440 --> 37:51.080
We do weasel stew mum's way.
Always the same.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.680
So why have you...

37:55.240 --> 37:58.400
What's happening?
Look.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.400
I can't feel my feet.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.800
Got mice in me skin.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.200
I'm pissing my drawers.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.520
What have you done?

38:10.560 --> 38:12.880
Let me tell you a story.

38:12.920 --> 38:15.880
Once upon a time,
there was a little princess

38:15.920 --> 38:20.560
who had an old uncle
she simply couldn't stand.

38:20.600 --> 38:25.280
So she ran away to the forest,

38:25.320 --> 38:28.000
where she met a witch.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.560
And she told the witch
the story of the evil uncle

38:31.600 --> 38:33.880
and what he'd done to her.

38:35.040 --> 38:37.440
And the witch said,
"I know a way

38:37.480 --> 38:41.280
"you can send your uncle
to the darkest part of hell."

38:43.480 --> 38:46.760
And the old witch
went to her shelf

38:46.800 --> 38:50.160
and she fetched down a jar.

38:50.200 --> 38:53.960
"Oh, what are those?"
Asked the princess.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.840
"These", replied the witch,
"are moon trees."

39:16.480 --> 39:19.200
Good citizens
of this benighted vale,

39:19.240 --> 39:23.120
I am Antedia,
Queen of the Regni.

39:23.160 --> 39:26.200
What's happening?
I was born sweet and cheerful,

39:26.240 --> 39:28.720
but then the gods,
in all their wisdom,

39:28.760 --> 39:31.640
robbed me of my only son.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.480
And I changed.

39:33.520 --> 39:37.040
I became a vengeful, cunning,

39:37.080 --> 39:39.960
merciless,
black-hearted bitch.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.200
But fear not,
you people will only feel

39:43.240 --> 39:45.960
the faintest flicker
of my wrath.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.400
Because I'm saving it up.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.880
Because in these isles,
there lives another

39:49.920 --> 39:53.720
upon whom I seek true vengeance.

39:53.760 --> 39:57.640
And so, it only remains for me
to say to you

39:57.680 --> 40:03.080
meat-headed, diabolic,
inbred cunts...

40:03.120 --> 40:06.680
..brace yourselves.

40:24.400 --> 40:29.520
Can you hear me, Aulus Plautius?

40:33.520 --> 40:36.640
I'm coming for you.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.520
Hundred horses.

41:51.480 --> 41:53.800
His wound is not healing.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.760
What if he dies?

41:57.800 --> 41:59.960
Does not pay to think that way.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.640
Quane...
The prophecy says-

42:01.680 --> 42:05.360
There's nothing in the prophecy
about me killing the first man.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.840
Nothing about this.
What's happening, Quane?

42:07.880 --> 42:10.080
If the prophecy...

42:10.960 --> 42:12.800
You have learnt much.

42:12.840 --> 42:15.600
And I say I cannot fool you.

42:15.640 --> 42:18.400
My boy, we have entered
a new age,

42:18.440 --> 42:22.720
an age so dark the words of
the prophets can no longer be seen.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.600
Whatever is happening.

42:26.640 --> 42:31.880
Whatever is unfolding,
it is not yet written.

42:37.480 --> 42:39.880
She won't desert us.

42:39.920 --> 42:43.240
How can you be sure?
Because I know her.

43:21.760 --> 43:25.760
