WEBVTT

00:21.229 --> 00:22.397
[birds chirping]

00:22.480 --> 00:23.648
[quietly] Easy now.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.526
All right, take your time.

00:26.609 --> 00:29.029
[foliage rustling]

00:32.532 --> 00:34.034
He's bloody huge.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.869
Yet no match for a bullet.

00:36.661 --> 00:40.206
Now, all it takes
is one clean shot to the heart

00:40.290 --> 00:42.292
to fell even the greatest of beasts.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.838
[steady exhale]

00:51.384 --> 00:52.260
[gunshot]

00:52.343 --> 00:54.012
[bellowing]

00:54.971 --> 00:56.890
-It's impossible.
-[crows cawing]

00:56.973 --> 00:59.559
Now, now. There'll be
plenty of other opportunities.

00:59.642 --> 01:01.227
I've failed each and every time.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.481
I can just hear what Benedict
will have to say about this.

01:04.564 --> 01:07.400
-Colin too.
-All the more reason to keep trying.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.902
They'll be insufferable.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.865
Shh. Shh, shh.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.757
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

01:30.840 --> 01:33.593
Whoo! You have to show me how to do that!

01:33.676 --> 01:35.553
Come along. [chuckles]

01:38.014 --> 01:41.392
It's more about confidence
than anything else.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.478
You decided that stag
was too large to shoot

01:43.561 --> 01:45.688
before you even touched
the trigger, I'm afraid.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.191
But you'll learn. You'll learn in time.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.860
[Anthony] You make it sound so easy.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.363
Nothing ever rattles you, does it?

01:54.864 --> 01:57.826
Oh, I believe your mother would have
quite a few things to say about that.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.038
You do know that
you cannot show someone your best

02:02.872 --> 02:05.208
without allowing them to see your worst.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.880
Speaking of which, she would adore those.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.174
[grunts softly]

02:14.592 --> 02:15.426
[grunts]

02:15.927 --> 02:17.929
[buzzing]

02:20.765 --> 02:22.433
[sniffs] Ah.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.145
-They're quite lovely, are they not?
-[buzzing]

02:25.228 --> 02:27.981
Daphne will be jealous
if we return with nothing for her.

02:29.691 --> 02:30.942
Ugh, this bloody…

02:31.568 --> 02:32.443
Ah.

02:33.820 --> 02:34.696
Father?

02:36.698 --> 02:38.366
The damn thing stung me.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.161
-Whatever--
-[grunts]

02:42.245 --> 02:44.038
-[gasping]
-[Anthony] Father?

02:45.790 --> 02:46.708
What is it?

02:46.791 --> 02:47.834
Father!

02:48.334 --> 02:49.502
[grunting]

02:49.586 --> 02:51.379
Wha-- What?

02:51.880 --> 02:53.631
-I can't-- [gasps]
-Help us, someone!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.717
[tense music playing]

02:57.969 --> 03:00.138
Someone, please! Help!

03:00.221 --> 03:01.639
-[gasping]
-Father!

03:02.849 --> 03:04.392
Help!

03:04.475 --> 03:05.393
What happened?

03:05.476 --> 03:07.604
I don't know! I don't know! I don't know!

03:07.687 --> 03:09.981
Was it a bee? A bee, I think.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.733
-Edmund.
-[gasping]

03:11.816 --> 03:14.485
-[Violet] Edmund, you must breathe.
-[gasps] I can't--

03:17.947 --> 03:20.158
[Violet breathing heavily]

03:21.326 --> 03:22.493
No, no.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.287
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.372
Please don't. Do not leave me.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.083
No, Ed-- Edmund!

03:29.751 --> 03:31.544
[sobbing] Do not leave me!

03:34.839 --> 03:35.715
[sobbing]

03:37.383 --> 03:38.801
[inhales sharply, gasps]

03:39.469 --> 03:40.428
Oh, God!

03:43.097 --> 03:44.140
[Violet sniffles]

03:44.224 --> 03:45.975
The other children. They cannot--

03:46.517 --> 03:48.311
[sobbing] They cannot see him.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.689
Anthony!

03:52.315 --> 03:53.608
Go!

03:54.817 --> 03:56.069
[continues sobbing]

03:56.152 --> 03:58.947
[heartbeat thumping]

04:11.084 --> 04:13.586
[Lady Whistledown]
We all know the great lengths

04:13.670 --> 04:17.340
a young lady will go
in pursuit of a proposal.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.261
And apparently,
she will travel great distances too.

04:21.344 --> 04:25.515
Lord Anthony Bridgerton
appears to be inching ever so closer

04:25.598 --> 04:27.558
to selecting his viscountess,

04:27.642 --> 04:30.937
and to that end
has invited our diamond to join him

04:31.020 --> 04:36.317
for an excursion
at his ancestral home, Aubrey Hall.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.279
Perhaps I'll wear
the pink silks at dinner tonight.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.489
Do you think Lord Bridgerton will like it?

04:41.572 --> 04:42.740
Of course he will, Bon.

04:42.824 --> 04:46.494
You need not worry
about the viscount's favor, Miss Edwina.

04:46.577 --> 04:50.123
It is an exceedingly good sign
that he has invited us to spend a few days

04:50.206 --> 04:54.544
with the family, before the rest
of the ton arrives for the real party.

04:54.627 --> 04:55.712
[both chuckle softly]

04:55.795 --> 04:58.381
Perhaps by then, you will have
an engagement to announce.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.883
-[dog whimpers]
-He will be assessing me, I know.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.177
Considering how
I might perform as viscountess.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.013
[Kate] And he should not be the only one.

05:05.096 --> 05:09.642
You too must consider if Lord Bridgerton
is everything you want in a match as well.

05:09.726 --> 05:10.852
[Lady Danbury] Indeed.

05:10.935 --> 05:13.980
We should all pass the week
with open minds.

05:16.357 --> 05:18.484
I shall be the very picture of amiability.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.738
Very well. Pink it is for dinner.

05:21.821 --> 05:27.577
[Lady Whistledown] Country air indeed
clears the mind and invigorates the body.

05:27.660 --> 05:31.581
Might this be the final gust
that pushes the viscount

05:31.664 --> 05:34.125
over the precipice of a proposal?

05:34.709 --> 05:38.379
Of course,
the luckless souls remaining in town

05:38.463 --> 05:40.882
will have to find new diversions

05:40.965 --> 05:44.427
in the absence
of their most precious of stones.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.636
For goodness' sake, Penelope.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.889
Stop your pacing
before you give me indigestion.

05:47.972 --> 05:48.931
Apologies, Mama.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.602
We have much to do before joining
the Bridgertons in a few days.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.021
We will head to the modiste
after breakfast.

05:55.104 --> 05:56.564
The modiste? Today?

05:58.733 --> 06:01.861
Oh. Are you off to make calls
this morning, my lord?

06:01.944 --> 06:03.071
Anyone in particular?

06:03.154 --> 06:06.449
-I thought to pay a visit to White's.
-[Lady Featherington] Excellent idea.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.619
I'm sure you'll find
the gentlemen there very good company.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.496
Good day, ladies.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.793
[sighs softly] I suppose I should be glad

06:16.876 --> 06:19.128
that he's not already
out courting his future bride.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.255
It's only a matter of time
before he brings home

06:21.339 --> 06:24.592
some young beauty
to oust us out onto the streets.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.011
Perhaps it will be Miss Uxbridge.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.222
Now, there's a chickabiddy
if ever I saw one.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.391
Varley. Not helping.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.187
What we need to find is someone

06:36.854 --> 06:37.730
malleable.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.816
Someone stupid enough
not to know any better,

06:39.899 --> 06:43.027
and certainly not to know how
to take on and manage a household.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.571
That would be in our best interest.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.489
The question is…

06:48.282 --> 06:49.617
-where?
-Hmm.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.537
[Prudence] I want to move
into Philippa's room.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.039
Why she always got
the bigger one has never been fair.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.208
What?

06:59.377 --> 07:03.214
We were just saying what an eligible
match Lord Featherington would make.

07:03.297 --> 07:05.007
-For whom?
-You.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.050
But he's our cousin.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.761
-Oh, Penelope.
-[Prudence] But he is our cousin.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.389
And since when
has that ever created an issue?

07:11.472 --> 07:14.016
It is not odd to marry one's cousin.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.103
It is regal.
Just look at the royal family.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.233
Besides,
he's your fourth cousin, nonetheless.

07:22.316 --> 07:26.112
Do you not wish
to be lady of this household, Prudence?

07:26.195 --> 07:30.741
Hosting dinners and balls,
the envy of all your friends?

07:30.825 --> 07:33.077
-Would I have such authority?
-If that is what you wish.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.037
You will charm him

07:35.872 --> 07:37.331
with some assistance.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.418
You will need a new dress or two,

07:40.501 --> 07:43.504
to appear rather more tempting.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.755
Tempting for what?

07:45.840 --> 07:47.133
Never you mind.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.051
[gasps] Off to the modiste, indeed!

07:55.850 --> 07:57.059
[gasps] Sister!

07:57.143 --> 07:59.937
Oh, I am so pleased you were able to come.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.524
As if I would allow dear Augie
to miss out on watching his mother

08:03.608 --> 08:05.401
win this little family tradition.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.571
-Second year in a row, if I might add.
-Charming words from a duchess.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.072
A duchess who is still a Bridgerton.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.782
Oh, come and see the baby, Eloise.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.827
-Why? Has he changed since I saw him last?
-[sighs]

08:14.911 --> 08:17.079
He's grown at least an inch, haven't you?

08:18.289 --> 08:20.708
-Who's that, then?
-[Violet chuckles]

08:21.876 --> 08:23.336
Oh, my lovely.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.004
-[gasps] Here we go.
-Yes.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.547
There we are. [gasps]

08:26.631 --> 08:27.632
There we go.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.259
-[baby crying]
-[Violet exclaims]

08:30.343 --> 08:32.178
Do not mind your Auntie Eloise.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.973
She's too busy reading
to notice anything else, as usual.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.184
[Eloise] Is it not nap time?

08:38.267 --> 08:42.438
Perhaps Uncle Colin will lull you to sleep
with his many tales from his travels.

08:42.522 --> 08:46.192
Yes. I seem to be missing the peace
and solitude of the Greek isles already.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.069
[affectionate laughter]

08:48.152 --> 08:50.780
[Daphne] Enjoying your brief respite

08:50.863 --> 08:54.116
from the ferocious packs
of marriage-minded young ladies, Brother?

08:54.659 --> 08:56.327
Quite the opposite, Sister.

08:56.410 --> 09:00.248
I have invited one such young lady
and her family to join us today.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.291
Anthony has invited
a young lady to Aubrey Hall?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.210
Yes, and she is quite lovely.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.712
My word!

09:06.796 --> 09:10.049
Well, I cannot wait to meet
the woman who has captured your heart.

09:10.132 --> 09:11.425
Tell me, what is she like?

09:11.509 --> 09:15.304
Miss Edwina is the picture
of grace, beauty, and charm.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.222
Hmm.

09:16.305 --> 09:19.392
Unfortunately, she has a most
annoying sister who has styled herself

09:19.475 --> 09:20.643
as something of a gatekeeper.

09:21.852 --> 09:25.064
I'm afraid you must
all help me win over both sisters,

09:25.147 --> 09:26.524
if I am to find my bride.

09:26.607 --> 09:30.278
And now you appeal for help.
My, you must be smitten by this miss.

09:30.361 --> 09:32.780
Or the sister is
a formidable obstacle, indeed.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.115
[Daphne] Fear not, Anthony.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.367
Seeing as though you were
such a help to me last season,

09:36.450 --> 09:38.286
it would only be fair of me
to return the favor.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.745
Is that a promise or a threat?

09:39.829 --> 09:40.663
Hmm.

09:41.205 --> 09:43.207
[horses snorting softly]

09:43.749 --> 09:45.751
Now,

09:45.835 --> 09:49.505
the only reason to endure such a journey

09:50.131 --> 09:56.345
is to see my great-godson.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.346
Hello.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.807
Well, it is a joy
to see you as well, Lady Danbury.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.267
Oh, Your Grace.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.060
Lady Mary.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.479
-So pleased to have you.
-Thank you for having us.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.399
-This is my daughter Edwina, you remember.
-Lovely to see you. I do.

10:08.482 --> 10:11.444
-And, of course, Kate, my eldest.
-[Violet chuckling]

10:20.453 --> 10:21.287
Ah.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.997
You're smiling.

10:23.664 --> 10:24.582
[sighs]

10:26.959 --> 10:28.836
I see my plan
to win you over is already working.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.755
I was smiling at the view,

10:30.838 --> 10:32.214
which you are now blocking.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.382
[dog barks]

10:33.466 --> 10:35.176
-Oh, you brought your dog.
-Yes.

10:35.259 --> 10:37.386
Newton is an excellent judge of character.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.013
-[barks]
-Oh.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.640
-See.
-[exhales]

10:41.349 --> 10:43.059
Mark my words, Miss Sharma.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.979
By the end of your stay,
your opinion of me will be much improved.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.564
As will his.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.607
[growls softly]

10:49.690 --> 10:51.400
I did not think you such an optimist.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.612
Since your schemes
to manipulate me are now out in the open,

10:54.695 --> 10:57.198
I suppose it would be
an improvement, indeed.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.784
And you must be Miss Edwina.

10:59.867 --> 11:00.868
[Anthony] No.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.537
This is her sister.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.122
Miss Kate Sharma.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.375
Ah. Forgive me, Miss Sharma.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.293
I'm entirely flattered, Your Grace.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.588
Allow me to introduce
my sister, Miss Edwina.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.513
-It is an honor, Your Grace.
-[chuckles softly]

11:20.596 --> 11:24.225
Miss Edwina, I am pleased
to introduce you to Aubrey Hall.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.811
[chuckles softly] It is a beautiful home.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.021
Thank you so much for inviting us.

11:29.105 --> 11:32.858
I very much look forward
to spending time with you and your family.

11:34.652 --> 11:38.572
[Violet] Well, now, you must be weary
from your travels. Mrs. Wilson.

11:38.656 --> 11:42.326
Please show our guests to their rooms
so they might get refreshed.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.121
-And ready for battle.
-Mm, indeed.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.206
-[chuckles]
-What can you mean?

11:47.289 --> 11:49.709
[nervous chuckle] Do not mind Eloise.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.669
She's always so spirited in the country.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.212
Then we have that in common.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.132
-Mother?
-[Violet] Mm?

11:56.799 --> 11:58.843
I believe there is something
I shall be needing now.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.180
[Violet] So you're quite set
on your decision, then, I take it?

12:03.264 --> 12:04.849
[Anthony] I made my intentions clear.

12:04.932 --> 12:08.310
[Violet] You must know there is no need
to hurry such a momentous occasion.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.354
The Sharmas have barely
unpacked their things.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.940
You should take the opportunity
to get to know one another.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.650
Mm. Unnecessary.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.487
Miss Edwina will make
the perfect viscountess, to be sure.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.045
This house carries many memories,

12:36.255 --> 12:37.548
good and bad.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.927
I only hope you are acting
with a clear mind.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.764
You have wanted me to marry for years.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.141
And now you suggest I wait?

12:47.224 --> 12:48.225
I did not say that.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.311
I only want you to be certain.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.276
[door opens]

12:59.612 --> 13:00.446
[door closes]

13:00.529 --> 13:01.530
[Nelson] My lord?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.574
[Violet panting, sobbing]

13:03.657 --> 13:06.410
My lord, might we begin
with the arrangements?

13:07.244 --> 13:09.371
The minister will need to be called,

13:09.455 --> 13:11.957
and the casket, of course.
One will need to be built.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.168
Forgive me, my lord.
I have questions about the body.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.212
Should I move it from his chambers?

13:16.295 --> 13:17.963
[Nelson] Also the business of the letters.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.174
-The letters?
-[Nelson] To give notice of the death.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.927
Not just to the other family,
but to the village too.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.888
We should send for the doctor.
She's still hysterical.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.057
I also must ask, my lord.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.185
Might you already have the keys to your
father's office? We've been searching.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.229
[Mrs. Wilson]
With the baby, this cannot be good.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.189
[Nelson] I'll have
your mother's things arranged,

13:35.272 --> 13:37.817
but I'll need to know
which room you'd like her moved to.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.485
Why would Mother be moved?

13:39.568 --> 13:42.321
[Nelson] Because those rooms
belong to you, my lord.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.782
You are the viscount now.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.867
[Violet weeping]

13:49.537 --> 13:51.038
[breathing shakily]

13:51.622 --> 13:53.624
[Violet continues sobbing]

14:00.756 --> 14:02.591
[Daphne] This will teach Colin.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.844
Last time,
he put a wicket behind the goat barn.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.887
[Kate] What exactly
are the rules of this game?

14:06.971 --> 14:08.722
[Daphne] Pall-mall
is less about the rules,

14:08.806 --> 14:10.182
more about the goal.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.518
Which is, of course,
to hit your ball through each wicket.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.437
The first player to send their ball
through the last wicket wins.

14:15.521 --> 14:19.149
Simple enough.
Though, if you are feeling devilish,

14:19.233 --> 14:21.694
you can use your turn
to knock an opponent's ball

14:21.777 --> 14:24.280
as far away from their next wicket
as you would like.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.616
Why waste a turn if the point is to get
one's own ball through the wicket?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.410
To infuriate your opponent, I gather?

14:29.493 --> 14:32.413
Precisely. It is a poor player
who plays the game,

14:32.496 --> 14:34.373
and a wise one who plays their opponent.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.375
I believe I shall rather enjoy this game.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.710
[chuckling softly]

14:38.919 --> 14:41.881
Right. Oh. Now, Benedict is a solid shot,

14:41.964 --> 14:43.632
but he avoids conflict.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.175
Colin is crafty.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.761
He will strike when he thinks
you are least suspecting it,

14:47.845 --> 14:49.597
so always be suspecting it.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.808
Eloise concentrates entirely
on defeating her older brothers.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.978
The hope is that she gets so absorbed
by them that she forgets about you.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.274
I, of course, am a complete enigma
who will divulge none of my secrets.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.943
And, well, then there is Anthony.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.362
Let me guess.
A most ruthless, cutthroat player.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.323
[chuckles] Why, you have
made his acquaintance.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.449
[chuckles]

15:09.450 --> 15:11.535
That is not to say he has no honor.

15:12.286 --> 15:16.582
He's usually the most genteel sportsman.
Except as far as this field is concerned.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.959
I'm sure the viscount
is an excellent player.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.253
We will all pass
a very pleasant afternoon.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.175
[bell tolling]

15:26.258 --> 15:27.968
No, it should be lower in the bust.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.471
We must make the most
of the young lady's figure.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.349
Lower.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.476
Madame, I must protest.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.227
-I don't pay you to protest.
-The line of--

15:37.311 --> 15:40.147
I pay you to fashion
the dresses as I see fit.

15:40.230 --> 15:43.525
On second thought,
perhaps it is this fabric.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.986
I hear there's
a new modiste across the street,

15:46.070 --> 15:47.279
just arrived from Vienna.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.530
Perhaps she'll have something

15:48.614 --> 15:51.659
that will display your assets
to their better advantage, Prudence.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.661
Let's get you dressed. [clears throat]

15:59.875 --> 16:00.960
[sighs]

16:05.089 --> 16:06.966
I quite liked your design.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.426
Merci beaucoup, Miss Penelope.

16:09.510 --> 16:14.306
I am always so clumsy
with my dresses, it seems.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.643
Well, just the other day,
I ripped my bodice,

16:17.726 --> 16:19.853
and I had to borrow a dress
from my maid to return home.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.940
-I believe you might have seen me.
-I do not recall.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.401
Are you often in that part of town?

16:25.484 --> 16:28.988
Seems it is rather far
from the fashionable side, is it not?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.199
Perhaps I might ask you the same thing.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.452
But I will not

16:36.328 --> 16:39.707
because I happen to believe
a lady's business is her own.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.251
-Would you not agree?
-I--

16:43.627 --> 16:45.921
Yes. I most certainly would.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.091
-[door opens]
-[man] The silks you ordered, ma'am.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.469
Oh. You may leave them at the back.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.764
I only hope I may have use for them.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.730
[Colin] Let's toss a coin.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.898
Last year, we promised
to let the youngest pick first.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.109
We pick based on alphabetical order.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.445
-That's the precedent.
-It's meant to be a game, is it not?

17:09.528 --> 17:10.779
[Daphne] Everyone, please, now.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.448
The only fair thing to do

17:12.531 --> 17:16.452
is to let our invited guests
choose their mallets and strike first.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.704
Please, take your pick, Miss Edwina.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.206
Hmm.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.043
An excellent choice.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.842
-The mallet of death.
-Would you look at that, Brother?

17:32.593 --> 17:33.594
Is this yours?

17:33.677 --> 17:35.304
Not at all. You're welcome to it.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.264
You threatened to beat me
last time I touched--

17:37.347 --> 17:39.933
-You exaggerate.
-[Kate] Are you the superstitious sort?

17:40.017 --> 17:42.561
I know some men cannot perform
without their familiar tools.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.021
Like a child with a blanket.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.689
[scoffing and chuckling]

17:45.773 --> 17:46.815
[Eloise clears throat]

17:46.899 --> 17:49.068
[Anthony] I can play
perfectly well with any mallet.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.360
I wish you the best of luck.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.946
Are we to stand around
deliberating all day, or shall we play?

17:53.530 --> 17:54.573
No! [groans]

17:54.656 --> 17:56.200
-[chuckling]
-[Anthony sighs]

17:56.283 --> 17:58.327
-[Daphne] To the field of combat!
-[Eloise] Mm-hmm.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.953
[jaunty classical music plays]

18:02.372 --> 18:03.248
[Colin] Come on.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.418
-[Benedict] Ooh.
-[chuckling lightly]

18:08.003 --> 18:09.129
[Eloise gasps]

18:10.339 --> 18:11.673
[players whoop, exclaim]

18:11.757 --> 18:13.258
[laughing]

18:14.218 --> 18:16.845
-[grunts]
-[Benedict] Out of practice much, Brother?

18:18.597 --> 18:19.723
Here, allow me.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.518
[exhales heavily]

18:23.560 --> 18:26.313
-Yes! [laughing]
-[players exclaiming]

18:26.396 --> 18:28.774
[Daphne] What a shot! Good start.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.694
-[Benedict] Eloise, stop cheating.
-No.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.321
[chuckling]

18:36.240 --> 18:37.741
[indistinct chatter]

18:39.785 --> 18:41.537
[Eloise] Would you take your shot?

18:43.831 --> 18:44.748
[Anthony groans]

18:44.832 --> 18:46.875
[Eloise] Ha! Rather unfortunate.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.844
-[all exclaiming]
-[applause]

19:00.514 --> 19:04.143
Are the demands of the day
affecting your game, Brother?

19:04.643 --> 19:05.769
Not a chance.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.522
Miss Edwina, I believe you are next.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.066
I did not wish
to leave my ball in your path,

19:11.150 --> 19:13.569
so I've left an open space
so you can send yours.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.779
How very kind of you, my lord.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.039
-[players groan]
-[Lady Danbury] Just wide.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.041
-[Mary] Very good, Edwina.
-[Anthony] Very good.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.085
Come on, Benedict. [sighs deeply]

19:30.169 --> 19:31.295
It was good.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.255
You'll find it gets easier.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.841
[women chuckling]

19:35.924 --> 19:36.842
Huh.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.636
Your head is clearly elsewhere, Brother.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.890
Otherwise, you never
would have given me such an easy shot.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.808
[Lady Danbury] Yes!

19:45.601 --> 19:46.894
[Colin chuckles]

19:47.394 --> 19:49.688
I will admit,
my thoughts are far from the field.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.275
[indistinct chatter]

19:54.443 --> 19:57.279
[chuckles] I have applied
to become a student of art

19:58.280 --> 19:59.990
at the Royal Academy Schools.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.576
-Have you? Congratulations.
-Well, do not celebrate yet.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.536
I await word of my acceptance.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.289
They only invite
a select few to study there, it seems.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.082
But still, it is an exciting prospect.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.835
Well, it's hardly a grand tour,
as you had with your travels.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.795
But, yes,

20:13.879 --> 20:16.298
I do hope to distinguish myself too.

20:18.008 --> 20:21.470
Watch it, now, Eloise. Yes, then.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.263
Send it.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.389
Send it!

20:24.473 --> 20:25.557
Brava!

20:25.641 --> 20:27.309
[laughing]

20:29.311 --> 20:30.229
[both sigh]

20:30.729 --> 20:33.023
Oh, I must compliment you
on your daughters, Lady Mary.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.942
They are a credit to you.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.860
They are my greatest blessing indeed.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.279
And perhaps our greatest challenge too.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.280
[laughs]

20:40.364 --> 20:42.157
During the marriage mart, at least.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.492
[both laughing]

20:43.575 --> 20:45.911
Yes, the season can be quite cutthroat.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.120
It has been some time

20:47.204 --> 20:49.039
since you have been
on English soil, has it not?

20:49.122 --> 20:51.500
Not since I left with my late husband.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.336
A lifetime ago, it seems.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.173
I quite understand.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.635
Aubrey Hall holds
many such memories for me as well.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.722
Well, they are off to a slow start,

21:05.806 --> 21:08.850
but I have hopes of bloodshed yet.

21:08.934 --> 21:09.977
[chuckles]

21:10.477 --> 21:11.687
Lady Danbury jests.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.940
My children may be rivalrous,
but we have yet to lose any limbs.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.486
Motherhood seems
to suit the duchess very well.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.363
Yes, it does.

21:21.446 --> 21:26.618
Our matchmaking efforts last season
were quite wise indeed, Lady Bridgerton.

21:27.286 --> 21:31.248
Yes. Perhaps we will have
such success again, Lady Danbury.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.625
Your follow-through
seems widely off-course.

21:33.709 --> 21:37.462
If they can somehow stay the course.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.258
[rousing classical music plays]

21:41.341 --> 21:43.093
-Yes!
-[cheering]

21:43.719 --> 21:44.761
Mark me, Brother!

21:47.723 --> 21:48.765
[all exclaiming]

21:48.849 --> 21:50.225
[Benedict] Cracking shot!

21:50.309 --> 21:52.185
-Yes!
-[Colin laughs]

21:53.061 --> 21:54.604
-[players] Oh!
-[Daphne] Oh, what luck!

21:57.774 --> 21:59.109
You have the chance to best him.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.111
That would not be
very sportsmanlike, would it?

22:01.194 --> 22:04.364
I was told unsportsmanlike conduct
was a requirement for this game.

22:04.448 --> 22:07.034
[chuckles] A fast learner
you are indeed, Miss Sharma.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.118
[Benedict chuckles]

22:09.161 --> 22:10.746
What do you say, my lord?

22:10.829 --> 22:12.039
Are you in a losing mood?

22:12.122 --> 22:15.292
My mood shall remain unchanged,
regardless of your choice.

22:15.375 --> 22:18.754
Ah, is that so? You would bravely bear
the crushing shame of defeat?

22:18.837 --> 22:21.465
-Play pleasant, Didi.
-Not to worry, Miss Edwina.

22:21.548 --> 22:24.009
In light of my brothers'
and sisters' tactics,

22:24.092 --> 22:26.553
Miss Sharma conducts herself
with much grace indeed.

22:26.636 --> 22:27.679
Huh. [clicks tongue]

22:27.763 --> 22:29.681
Then you shall not mind this.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.311
-[chuckles]
-Well done!

22:34.394 --> 22:35.896
[applause]

22:37.606 --> 22:39.191
-I knew I liked her.
-Miss Edwina.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.234
It's your turn.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.235
Oh.

22:54.790 --> 22:55.957
[Benedict groans]

23:02.172 --> 23:03.590
I am bested, I see.

23:03.673 --> 23:06.843
You could still retrieve your ball
if you wish to stay in the game.

23:06.927 --> 23:07.803
[chuckles softly]

23:18.271 --> 23:19.856
I think I shall cut out.

23:25.904 --> 23:26.738
I sh…

23:28.448 --> 23:31.034
I shall, uh… join you if you like?

23:33.703 --> 23:36.164
There is no need
to spoil your fun on my account.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.000
I shall enjoy
some refreshments with our mamas.

23:43.505 --> 23:44.965
-[Daphne] Oh!
-[mallet cracks]

23:45.048 --> 23:46.883
[Benedict] Ugh. I missed it.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.677
[Eloise] Colin, it's your turn.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.636
[sighs]

23:55.851 --> 23:57.644
[Anthony] Oh, what a shot, Brother!

23:58.145 --> 23:59.646
[chuckling]

23:59.729 --> 24:01.731
Yes! What a shame.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.191
You two better go fetch them.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.694
Unless you would like
to quit, here and now?

24:05.777 --> 24:07.779
[jaunty classical music plays]

24:08.697 --> 24:10.031
Absolutely not.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.324
After you.

24:25.672 --> 24:26.631
[Anthony groans]

24:28.341 --> 24:29.426
[Anthony grunts]

24:29.509 --> 24:32.012
You best hope your play
does not hand victory to my brothers,

24:32.095 --> 24:33.597
or we shall never hear the end of it.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.308
While you would be
magnanimous in victory, I am sure.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.560
[panting]

24:40.061 --> 24:40.937
Oh.

24:41.021 --> 24:41.897
Dash it!

24:41.980 --> 24:43.982
-[insects buzzing]
-[birds chirping]

24:45.984 --> 24:49.321
We could pluck them out.
No one would be any the wiser.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.323
But I would know.

24:52.866 --> 24:53.992
[sighs]

24:54.576 --> 24:58.163
So, you do have honor, then.
At least as far as sport is concerned.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.665
That, and the fact I suspect
you'd loudly advertise my cheating

25:00.749 --> 25:02.042
the moment I stepped out of line.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.418
And vice versa.

25:05.879 --> 25:06.922
[mud squelches]

25:11.551 --> 25:13.053
There's nothing for it, then.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.109
[sighs]

25:28.652 --> 25:30.070
Your play, my lord.

25:30.153 --> 25:32.906
Unless you do not wish
to dirty those fine boots of yours?

25:32.989 --> 25:34.991
Do not worry about my boots.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.621
[whimsical music plays]

25:50.757 --> 25:52.300
[boots sloshing]

25:59.057 --> 25:59.891
Help.

26:00.934 --> 26:01.935
Just pull.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.937
I am trying. It is stuck.

26:06.815 --> 26:07.899
[sighs]

26:13.405 --> 26:15.240
-Ow!
-Do you want my help or not?

26:15.949 --> 26:16.783

-[shrieks]

26:22.831 --> 26:23.748
[Anthony groans]

26:26.876 --> 26:28.044
It is not amusing.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.504
I did not say it was.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.508
[breathing heavily]

26:35.302 --> 26:37.304
[both chuckling]

26:39.556 --> 26:41.725
[both laughing]

26:45.353 --> 26:47.272
I can't-- [clears throat]

[Kate sighs]

26:50.692 --> 26:52.485
-[Anthony groans]
-[both chuckle]

26:54.863 --> 26:58.074
I believe I…
underestimated you, Miss Sharma.

26:58.992 --> 27:02.037
That seems to be the theme
of our acquaintance, does it not?

27:02.120 --> 27:03.204
[Anthony grunts]

27:04.372 --> 27:06.750
Well, since we are long past formalities…

27:09.377 --> 27:10.920
tell me frankly. [grunts]

27:11.755 --> 27:13.423
What must I do to win your approval?

27:13.506 --> 27:16.092
I do not withhold it
out of spite, my lord.

27:17.093 --> 27:20.847
I simply wish to steer my sister
to the greatest possible happiness.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.017
I'd have thought
you could understand my position,

27:24.100 --> 27:26.895
seeing as you too have sisters to protect.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.480
It's different. It's my duty as their--

27:28.563 --> 27:31.941
I am the same for Edwina,
in every way that matters.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.446
Then let us put
our past acrimony behind us,

27:36.529 --> 27:37.489
and allow me to prove

27:37.572 --> 27:40.200
I can offer your sister
all the happiness and security you seek.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.117
Could you…

27:42.243 --> 27:43.620
Could you do me that favor?

27:49.959 --> 27:51.086
Truce or not,

27:52.087 --> 27:54.756
I shall never surrender to you
on the sporting field.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.094
Ha!

27:59.177 --> 28:00.595
Your turn, my lord.

28:05.975 --> 28:07.102
Is something the matter?

28:07.185 --> 28:09.145
-[Colin exclaims]
-[Daphne] I have won!

28:09.229 --> 28:10.480
[laughter and applause]

28:10.563 --> 28:11.898
[chuckles]

28:11.981 --> 28:13.900
She will be amusing company at dinner.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.367
Lord Bridgerton,
do you not wish to retrieve--

28:22.450 --> 28:23.618
The game is over.

[somber classical music plays]

29:27.182 --> 29:29.267
[young Daphne singing indistinctly]

29:29.350 --> 29:30.852
[Violet] You cannot do this.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.730
You get him back in here now!

29:33.813 --> 29:36.566
My lord. You must come in.

29:36.649 --> 29:37.484
Me?

29:37.567 --> 29:38.818
It is imperative.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.904
-Ah.
-[Violet moaning]

29:48.161 --> 29:49.829
[Violet screaming]

29:49.913 --> 29:53.249
[Doctor Lewis] All is well. Please.
You must not be standing.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.418
All is not well.
I have done this seven times.

29:55.502 --> 29:58.880
I know what well is,
and this is not well. He cannot do this.

29:58.963 --> 29:59.798
[panting]

29:59.881 --> 30:02.425
I will not allow it. You stop him.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.219
The baby is not in position.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.763
-What does that mean?
-It's turned the wrong way.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.556
I need to know what you'd like us to do.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.225
-I don't know what you--
-I'll do my best.

30:10.308 --> 30:12.685
But there may need to be a choice made.

30:14.270 --> 30:15.980
Who would your lordship prefer?

30:17.440 --> 30:20.151
-What?
-[Violet] What are you saying to him?

30:20.235 --> 30:22.445
I told you, you may not speak to him.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.656
Speak to me!

30:24.739 --> 30:25.573
[shouts]

30:25.657 --> 30:27.826
It is a conversation for his lordship.

30:27.909 --> 30:30.745
[Violet] His lordship is a child!

30:31.663 --> 30:36.751
He's my child. He was born
in this very room, from this very body.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.212
It is no matter to him.

30:39.295 --> 30:40.964
Let us speak in the hall.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.591
[Violet] No, Anthony.
Do not leave this room.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.594
Mother, please. Lie down, still your mind.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.180
I will find out what he is asking of me
and return immediately.

30:49.264 --> 30:53.393
He is asking of you to decide
which one of us should live.

30:53.476 --> 30:56.062
Me or the baby.

30:56.145 --> 30:59.399
You kill the baby. You save the mother.

31:00.191 --> 31:02.986
You cut the mother. You save the child.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.863
It is not your choice to make.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.948
-It is mine.
-It is his lordship's choice.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.200
Edmund is his lordship!

31:09.284 --> 31:10.535
[sobbing]

31:12.453 --> 31:14.956
The choice is Edmund's.

31:15.039 --> 31:18.710
It could only be Edmund's
because he loved me.

31:19.669 --> 31:24.465
He loved me so much.
This wouldn't even be a conversation.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.594
Because that kind of love,

31:28.720 --> 31:32.015
the answer, this choice,

31:32.807 --> 31:34.225
is obvious.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.560
[groans, sniffles]

31:36.895 --> 31:39.689
I should not have
to explain this to anyone!

31:40.815 --> 31:43.234
[sobbing] Edmund should be here!

31:43.818 --> 31:45.069
[wails]

31:47.906 --> 31:49.073
Do what she wants.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.200
-Your lordship--
-Whatever she chooses.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.953
I will do my best to save them both.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.747
[Violet wails loudly]

31:59.417 --> 32:01.461
[Violet crying faintly] Do not leave me!

32:10.887 --> 32:14.432
Flutter it so,
to draw his eyes to your bosom.

32:15.058 --> 32:15.975
There.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.227
And remember to laugh at his jokes.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.480
Every man wishes
to be thought a sharp wit.

32:20.563 --> 32:21.731
[door opens]

32:21.814 --> 32:23.149
Good afternoon.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.823
It is a good day, indeed.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.076
It's hot, though.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.411
Is it not, Prudence?

32:35.495 --> 32:37.580
Yes, it's very hot.

32:38.748 --> 32:40.291
Unseasonably so.

32:40.875 --> 32:41.876
[clears throat]

32:44.462 --> 32:46.923
Mama, might I return to the modiste?

32:47.006 --> 32:49.092
-I need new ribbons.
-Not now, Penelope.

32:53.846 --> 32:54.847
Uh… [clears throat]

32:54.931 --> 32:58.101
Prudence was just asking
about the Americas.

32:58.184 --> 33:00.311
-Were you not, Prudence?
-I--

33:01.145 --> 33:01.980
Yes.

33:02.772 --> 33:04.107
You have an interest in travel?

33:04.691 --> 33:05.984
Adore it.

33:07.276 --> 33:09.737
[hesitates] I mean to say,
I would adore it.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.491
I-- I have not been further than Sussex.

33:14.325 --> 33:17.787
Mama says everywhere beyond Hampshire
is positively uncivilized.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.164
[Lady Featherington chuckles softly]

33:21.207 --> 33:22.125
How she jests.

33:22.208 --> 33:25.003
Dear Pru is… such a wit. [chuckles]

33:25.086 --> 33:27.964
Well, the Americas
are certainly further than Hampshire.

33:29.007 --> 33:32.301
[cackles loudly]

33:36.973 --> 33:39.642
Oh, I have invited
the Cowpers to dinner this evening.

33:41.352 --> 33:42.478
The Cowpers?

33:43.855 --> 33:46.024
Uh, could this have anything to do

33:46.107 --> 33:49.110
with the necklace
you gifted Miss Cowper, I believe it was?

33:49.193 --> 33:51.487
[Jack] Do I need a reason
to enjoy their company?

33:51.988 --> 33:54.323
You'll make the arrangements?
Venison, perhaps?

33:56.451 --> 33:58.828
[sighs] It did not work.

33:58.911 --> 34:01.456
Cousin Jack did not glance
once at my bosom.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.082
Stop calling him that.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.918
And stop that too.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.051
I do hope the afternoon
was not too taxing for you.

34:13.134 --> 34:14.761
Not at all, my lord.

34:15.470 --> 34:18.681
My brothers and sisters,
they can be wearying.

34:18.765 --> 34:21.601
Oh. I find it is impossible for me

34:21.684 --> 34:24.062
to grow weary in the fresh country air.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.480
That is a happy outlook.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.858
You shall need it if you are to spend
much more time with the Bridgertons.

34:28.941 --> 34:29.859
[exhales]

34:35.823 --> 34:38.785
Do you imagine you should like
to raise your family out here

34:38.868 --> 34:40.453
in the country, my lord?

34:40.536 --> 34:44.499
It is likely my responsibilities
will keep me moving around quite often.

34:45.291 --> 34:48.002
It is entirely possible
that there will be stretches of time

34:48.628 --> 34:51.005
where I'll be apart
from my children. My wife too.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.048
[chuckles softly]

34:53.007 --> 34:55.968
I do look forward to supporting my husband

34:56.052 --> 34:58.012
in whatever his endeavors may be.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.974
[Anthony] You do express yourself
so agreeably, Miss Edwina.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.602
It is refreshing and rare indeed.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.191
Though, to be clear, my lord,

35:11.067 --> 35:13.528
that is not to say
I do not have a mind of my own.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.280
I have found that

35:16.364 --> 35:18.282
one may easily remain agreeable

35:18.366 --> 35:20.868
when one also has inner resources.

35:21.744 --> 35:24.122
I myself am fortunate

35:24.205 --> 35:28.084
to have found a love of literature,
but also of learning as well.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.503
It is why I am

35:31.129 --> 35:34.090
quite content in different circumstances.

35:34.632 --> 35:35.800
Fulfilled even,

35:36.467 --> 35:39.554
in all my varied interests
and employments, you see.

35:41.931 --> 35:42.932
I must admit to you.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.103
The only books I have read this year

35:47.186 --> 35:50.022
are ledgers of the estate's accounts.

35:50.106 --> 35:53.276
[quietly] And, um,
they're all dreadfully boring.

35:53.359 --> 35:54.694
[chuckles lightly]

35:55.611 --> 35:57.613
[all chuckling softly]

35:59.115 --> 36:00.992
It is perfect, then.

36:01.075 --> 36:02.535
You are much too busy to read,

36:02.618 --> 36:05.371
and I am very much in need
of someone to tell about my stories.

36:05.454 --> 36:06.789
[Anthony chuckles lightly]

36:06.873 --> 36:08.749
[Edwina] I so enjoy talking of books.

36:09.542 --> 36:10.543
Go on, then.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.421
Have you read Ghalib?

36:17.216 --> 36:18.759
-Never.
-[chuckles]

36:19.552 --> 36:20.428
Good.

36:20.511 --> 36:22.013
[both chuckle]

36:24.599 --> 36:26.267
-[chuckling]
-[indistinct chatter]

36:26.350 --> 36:28.019
He is quite funny.

36:28.102 --> 36:28.936
[Kate] Hmm.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.647
-A good thing, I suppose.
-Intelligent too.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.524
I would have not expected otherwise.

36:33.608 --> 36:36.360
And the conversation,
there were no awkward pauses.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.821
Really. No truly disastrous lulls.

36:39.739 --> 36:40.865
What…

36:40.948 --> 36:42.241
What did you talk about?

36:42.325 --> 36:44.160
[Edwina] His family, to begin with.

36:44.243 --> 36:47.914
[Kate] So it was all about him, then?
Bon, if the conversation felt one-sided--

36:47.997 --> 36:49.165
Only it did not.

36:49.790 --> 36:53.794
[sighs] I was convinced
my poor showing on the pall-mall field

36:53.878 --> 36:56.589
left the viscount feeling… indifferent.

36:56.672 --> 37:00.009
But he asked me questions
about myself, about our family.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.386
He was interested
in everything I had to say, Didi.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.805
In the books I have read,
even in the books I have not.

37:06.098 --> 37:07.099
Well, uh,

37:08.351 --> 37:11.938
I-- I only hope his intentions
were genuine and nothing less.

37:12.021 --> 37:14.565
I truly believe
something will come of this.

37:14.649 --> 37:15.483
[chuckles]

37:17.485 --> 37:18.778
A proposal, Didi.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.364
I can feel it.

37:23.699 --> 37:26.285
So, it is all going well, then?

37:26.369 --> 37:27.662
Extremely.

37:27.745 --> 37:32.166
And did Miss Edwina mention pall-mall?
She did not appear to be having much fun.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.501
Well, how could she have done,

37:33.584 --> 37:36.379
when the lot of you
were downright gladiatorial out there?

37:36.462 --> 37:38.631
[Daphne] As if the game
can be played any other way.

37:38.714 --> 37:41.217
I was surprised she played
for as long as she did.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.053
It is no matter.

37:44.929 --> 37:48.849
Miss Edwina did not need to win
a silly game in order to win my heart.

37:49.809 --> 37:52.436
Who are you,
and what have you done with my brother?

37:53.020 --> 37:55.856
-Daph.
-Has this young lady truly won your heart?

37:55.940 --> 37:56.983
[Anthony] You met her.

37:57.066 --> 37:59.360
You met her family. She is delightful,

37:59.443 --> 38:00.945
and pleasant,

38:01.028 --> 38:02.113
and interesting.

38:02.613 --> 38:03.781
Even wise.

38:04.991 --> 38:07.076
What exactly are your objections?

38:07.868 --> 38:10.288
Well, I s-- I suppose I do not have any.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.916
If you say Miss Edwina is the one for you.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.878
If you say she is the one
in whose presence

38:17.962 --> 38:22.633
you cannot properly think,
or even… or even breathe.

38:23.592 --> 38:25.720
If you say you feel that feeling.

38:26.679 --> 38:27.680
Feeling?

38:29.849 --> 38:30.683
What--

38:33.102 --> 38:33.936
Uh…

38:34.812 --> 38:38.190
The one that makes it impossible
for you to look away from them

38:38.274 --> 38:39.900
at any given moment.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.236
When your

38:43.279 --> 38:44.780
body and soul

38:46.449 --> 38:49.160
feel as if they could burst into flames

38:49.243 --> 38:50.911
whenever the two of you are near.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.417
When all you are able to do
in their presence

38:56.500 --> 39:01.005
is to fight the urge to lean forward
and… and touch their lips with yours.

39:04.884 --> 39:07.762
If that is the feeling you have
when you are with Miss Edwina,

39:07.845 --> 39:09.805
I am quite happy for you indeed.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.603
I could not have
described it better myself.

39:17.855 --> 39:18.689
Huh.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.195
[whimsical music plays]

39:34.288 --> 39:35.790
Do I really wish to know?

39:38.292 --> 39:39.627
Do not answer that.

39:52.765 --> 39:57.478
How agreeable that you could all join us
this evening, and on such little notice.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.480
Of course, Lady Featherington.

39:59.563 --> 40:03.025
How dare we decline an invitation
from the man of the hour?

40:03.109 --> 40:04.402
Apparently. [chuckles]

40:04.485 --> 40:07.863
Yes, the new Lord Featherington
has certainly made a splash in town.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.698
Has he not, Prudence?

40:12.660 --> 40:13.869
[Prudence clears throat]

40:14.453 --> 40:15.913
Lord Featherington,

40:15.996 --> 40:17.706
I'm quite interested to hear more

40:17.790 --> 40:20.251
about your gemstone mines
back in the Americas.

40:20.334 --> 40:23.754
They certainly do make for the most
exquisite of necklaces, my lord.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.548
Why talk of rubies across the ocean

40:25.631 --> 40:28.008
when there is so much
to discover just here?

40:28.092 --> 40:32.012
Tell me, Miss Cowper,
do you have brothers, perchance?

40:32.096 --> 40:33.931
Alas, I am an only child.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.725
But I consider myself
particularly maternal.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.102
[Lady Featherington coughs]

40:39.270 --> 40:41.021
[chuckling] Pardon me.

40:41.105 --> 40:42.440
You were saying, dearest?

40:42.523 --> 40:44.567
Well, I would never dream of bragging…

40:44.650 --> 40:49.238
[chuckles] …but I have always been told
I have a warm, affectionate disposition.

40:49.321 --> 40:52.116
You are a credit to your sex, indeed.

40:52.199 --> 40:53.617
[Lord Cowper] I say, Featherington,

40:53.701 --> 40:56.328
I bet you could never find
a venison like this in the Americas.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.665
[chuckles] There is certainly nothing
like English cooking.

40:59.748 --> 41:03.752
Then you must be our guest.
My cook is renowned for her trifle.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.714
Is that the cook you stole
from the Evans household?

41:07.423 --> 41:08.257
[clears throat]

41:08.966 --> 41:11.177
[Lady Cowper] I am curious, my lord.

41:11.260 --> 41:16.056
All those years traveling,
you have not been tempted to marry?

41:17.016 --> 41:19.643
I wished to establish myself
in the world first.

41:20.394 --> 41:23.063
Uh, but now, as Lord Featherington,

41:24.106 --> 41:27.151
there comes a time in everyone's life
when one needs a partner.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.571
Someone who sees you as you truly are

41:31.363 --> 41:33.782
to help ease the burdens
of the day. [chuckles]

41:35.367 --> 41:36.660
[Lady Featherington] Hmm.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.121
Is that a new dress, Cressida?

41:39.205 --> 41:40.789
[Lady Cowper] Is it not lovely?

41:40.873 --> 41:43.918
That new modiste is most accomplished.

41:44.001 --> 41:46.420
Madame Delacroix's designs seem

41:46.504 --> 41:49.215
rather tired by comparison. [chuckles]

41:49.798 --> 41:51.383
Could you stop your interruptions?

41:51.467 --> 41:54.512
-I was merely asking.
-Prudence, did you say something?

41:55.262 --> 41:56.263
[coughs]

41:56.805 --> 41:59.475
I did, in fact.

42:00.893 --> 42:02.978
I was wondering if, perhaps after dinner,

42:03.062 --> 42:05.397
I might display
my singing voice for everyone?

42:05.481 --> 42:06.315
Oh, dear Lord.

42:06.398 --> 42:07.775
Have I mentioned my Cressida

42:07.858 --> 42:10.444
is accomplished
in both song and the pianoforte?

42:10.528 --> 42:11.362
[chuckles]

42:11.445 --> 42:13.072
Oh my. I could never do that. Philippa--

42:13.155 --> 42:15.533
Miss Cowper, are you occupied on Thursday?

42:16.325 --> 42:19.495
Might I ask you for the honor
of your company for a promenade?

42:19.578 --> 42:21.205
-Rotten Row, perhaps?
-[chuckles]

42:21.705 --> 42:24.083
I would be simply delighted, my lord.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.051
I really would be happy to sing--

42:34.134 --> 42:35.803
-Enough, Prudence.
-[utensils clatter]

42:42.476 --> 42:45.771
[Colin] If it is a clear mind you seek,
Brother, I may know how to help.

42:45.854 --> 42:49.024
Worldly travelers use it
as a way to open their minds

42:49.108 --> 42:51.360
and transcend ordinary anxieties.

42:55.281 --> 42:56.532
[sniffs, swallows]

42:56.615 --> 42:58.242
Smells rather foul, does it not?

42:58.325 --> 43:01.203
It only takes the smallest
of doses to feel the effects.

43:07.585 --> 43:08.752
Whatever is the point?

43:08.836 --> 43:11.880
I hardly think a tea will distract me
from the momentous decision

43:11.964 --> 43:14.675
the proctors at the Royal Schools
are making at this very moment.

43:14.758 --> 43:16.302
[Colin] Or perhaps it will allow you

43:16.385 --> 43:18.512
to escape the thoughts
that've been plaguing your mind.

43:18.596 --> 43:21.265
The doubts,
the questions that seem to linger,

43:21.348 --> 43:23.225
no matter how far you go to escape them.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.604
-Are you quite well, Brother?
-You will see.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.647
This tea is quite the elixir.

43:29.231 --> 43:32.943
On one occasion, in Paxos,
I found myself meditating for hours

43:33.027 --> 43:35.696
upon a single blade of grass. [chuckles]

43:44.121 --> 43:44.997
[Colin] Uh…

43:48.626 --> 43:50.502
[chuckles] Hell and the devil.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.088
[groans] That's bad.

43:53.839 --> 43:55.049
[Colin chuckles]

44:16.737 --> 44:17.571
Oh.

44:18.322 --> 44:19.198
[chuckles softly]

44:19.281 --> 44:20.157
Hi.

44:21.450 --> 44:23.702
You must not let
the game of pall-mall dismay you.

44:23.786 --> 44:26.163
Antagonism is, I'm afraid,
what you must expect.

44:26.246 --> 44:27.706
[chuckles softly]

44:39.468 --> 44:41.553
Can I ask you something, Miss Eloise?

44:41.637 --> 44:45.140
Did I purposely make the third wicket
two inches narrower than last year? Yes.

44:45.808 --> 44:46.767
[chuckles softly]

44:47.851 --> 44:48.686
Anything.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.315
I fear I may have upset
the viscount during our game.

44:53.399 --> 44:54.233
Ah.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.902
You were near our father's grave?

44:58.278 --> 45:00.197
Well, then his mood
was not on your account.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.824
He rarely goes near if he can help it.

45:07.204 --> 45:08.831
Can I ask you something?

45:12.209 --> 45:14.086
Was it your choice you never married?

45:14.169 --> 45:17.214
My brothers tell me
I have a habit of being rather direct.

45:18.090 --> 45:22.469
But everyone tells me it is fate
worse than death to end up a spinster.

45:23.721 --> 45:27.099
But you seem
perfectly content with your situation.

45:27.182 --> 45:28.183
[chuckles]

45:31.019 --> 45:33.105
You must know, it is hardly ideal.

45:33.731 --> 45:36.817
The world is not exactly welcoming
to an unmarried woman.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.902
There seems to be
no place in society for us,

45:38.986 --> 45:40.779
except at the edge of things.

45:40.863 --> 45:43.741
That rather seems
to be society's flaw, not a woman's.

45:43.824 --> 45:44.742
[chuckles]

45:45.993 --> 45:47.202
Indeed, it does.

46:32.539 --> 46:33.373
Mother.

46:35.834 --> 46:36.710
There you are.

46:37.586 --> 46:38.879
Here I am.

46:42.257 --> 46:43.592
You look well.

46:46.470 --> 46:47.554
I slept.

46:49.389 --> 46:50.557
I bathed.

46:52.768 --> 46:55.646
I went for a walk outdoors.
I saw the children.

46:57.856 --> 47:00.567
I went to chapel. Now I'm making myself

47:01.610 --> 47:04.279
useful with embroidery.

47:04.863 --> 47:06.281
Perhaps join us for family dinner?

47:10.702 --> 47:12.120
I know this is hard.

47:12.871 --> 47:13.997
I know you miss him.

47:14.081 --> 47:15.707
-[Violet] Please…
-But we all miss him.

47:16.291 --> 47:17.709
-And I think--
-Anthony, this is it.

47:17.793 --> 47:20.337
This is my best. I am doing my best.

47:21.338 --> 47:22.965
[crying] Every day, I get up,

47:23.048 --> 47:27.719
I get dressed, I feed myself,
I try to breathe in and out.

47:29.221 --> 47:32.474
I force myself to stop by the nursery.

47:34.017 --> 47:35.602
And I think about how

47:36.728 --> 47:39.565
sorry I feel for little baby Hyacinth

47:39.648 --> 47:43.068
because she will
never know Edmund's laugh.

47:45.028 --> 47:46.738
Or the way he smelled,

47:46.822 --> 47:50.576
or what it is to be hugged in his arms.

47:53.745 --> 47:57.124
I feel even sorrier for myself
because, most of the time,

47:57.207 --> 47:59.459
all I am thinking is that this little baby

47:59.543 --> 48:02.212
did not do me the kindness of killing me

48:02.296 --> 48:05.340
so that I could be with my husband.

48:07.926 --> 48:10.429
Edmund was the air that I breathed.

48:13.140 --> 48:15.100
And now there is no air.

48:17.895 --> 48:18.770
So,

48:20.230 --> 48:22.816
do not ask me about family dinner.

48:27.654 --> 48:29.489
I am doing my best.

48:33.827 --> 48:35.162
[Violet, distant] Anthony?

48:37.539 --> 48:38.582
Anthony.

48:41.001 --> 48:43.462
-I can take my leave.
-No. Stay.

48:44.087 --> 48:44.922
Please.

49:05.692 --> 49:07.444
Lilacs were his favorite.

49:19.039 --> 49:20.123
Dearest.

49:21.416 --> 49:23.418
I hate to see you like this.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.671
So weighed down.

49:26.713 --> 49:29.633
Courtship,
the consideration of a proposal,

49:29.716 --> 49:33.053
choosing the person you wish
to spend the rest of your life with.

49:33.679 --> 49:37.724
My darling boy,
it should be a time full of joy.

49:38.517 --> 49:40.227
-I am content.
-Mm.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.730
I'm fulfilling my duty
to this family, Mother.

49:44.898 --> 49:46.775
That is what
takes precedence above all else.

49:46.858 --> 49:48.944
Just because
you are dedicated to this family

49:49.027 --> 49:52.948
does not mean that there should be
no room left for love, Anthony.

49:55.367 --> 49:58.286
Your father took his role
as viscount seriously,

49:58.370 --> 50:01.540
but he also loved deeply.

50:02.249 --> 50:05.544
I know that is what you want too.
I know that, deep down,

50:05.627 --> 50:07.379
it is what you have always wanted.

50:07.462 --> 50:09.089
You're quite certain how well you know me.

50:09.172 --> 50:12.384
I know how sweet
and earnest you were as a boy.

50:12.968 --> 50:16.096
Always with a kind word and a joke.

50:18.682 --> 50:21.685
But then, after your father died,
a wall went up inside you,

50:21.768 --> 50:24.521
as if love had become some…

50:25.564 --> 50:27.274
some weakness

50:28.358 --> 50:31.153
instead of your greatest strength.
And that is not you.

50:33.780 --> 50:36.491
You deserve the feeling that I had

50:36.575 --> 50:39.453
the moment your father
placed that ring on my finger.

50:40.954 --> 50:43.457
It was a promise,
not just of the sacred commitment

50:43.540 --> 50:45.584
that we were making
to one another, but a sacred love.

50:45.667 --> 50:48.336
-Love shall have no place in my marriage.
-You cannot mean that.

50:48.420 --> 50:52.382
I seek an amiable partner
with whom I may share a pleasant life,

50:52.466 --> 50:55.343
untouched by heartbreak
and the ravages of grief.

50:59.931 --> 51:01.892
You were barely even there…

51:03.894 --> 51:05.145
after he died.

51:05.979 --> 51:07.522
And yet, I, myself,

51:08.148 --> 51:10.692
am cursed to remember every waking moment.

51:13.403 --> 51:14.321
I could never…

51:15.489 --> 51:18.241
I could never be the cause of such pain,

51:19.618 --> 51:22.829
no matter how cruel and hard-hearted
everyone else may find me to be.

51:38.136 --> 51:39.846
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

51:39.930 --> 51:43.266
[Benedict] This room
is exceptionally well-lit.

51:44.267 --> 51:45.894
Have you noticed, Col?

51:46.937 --> 51:49.564
The twinkle of the candles, it is as--

51:49.648 --> 51:53.777
-It's as if… we sit among the stars.
-What is wrong with you?

51:53.860 --> 51:57.989
I was just telling Benedict
how brilliant the stars were in Greece.

51:59.658 --> 52:01.868
[Daphne] Are you enjoying
your time here, Miss Edwina?

52:01.952 --> 52:05.163
I am, very much.
The buzz of the city is thrilling indeed,

52:05.247 --> 52:07.499
but I quite enjoy
the peace of the country.

52:07.582 --> 52:10.293
As do I. Though I dare say.
It is not quite so peaceful

52:10.377 --> 52:12.462
with my entire family in residence.

52:12.546 --> 52:14.464
[Edwina chuckling]

52:14.548 --> 52:15.632
I understand, my lord.

52:15.715 --> 52:19.511
Certainly, I cannot compare my family
with your seven brothers and sisters,

52:19.594 --> 52:20.720
but,

52:21.221 --> 52:23.890
my sister and I were known
to be a handful growing up too.

52:23.974 --> 52:25.016
Mm. I can imagine.

52:25.100 --> 52:28.436
[Edwina] But Kate always
has had my best interests at heart.

52:28.520 --> 52:30.772
She bears
a heavy responsibility for our family.

52:30.856 --> 52:33.150
That sounds remarkably
similar to you, Anthony.

52:33.984 --> 52:36.153
Much familial
responsibility to bear, indeed.

52:36.236 --> 52:38.071
-[Benedict sighs]
-[Colin] It was a revelation.

52:38.155 --> 52:41.116
Made all the better by the knowledge
that I may have been the only Briton

52:41.199 --> 52:42.701
to see it in decades.

52:42.784 --> 52:44.828
[Benedict moans] Mmm. Mmm!

52:45.704 --> 52:46.705
[Kate gasps]

52:46.788 --> 52:49.416
Benedict, dear, you alarm our guests.

52:49.499 --> 52:51.710
-It's all right, Lady Bridgerton.
-[Lady Danbury] Perhaps…

52:51.793 --> 52:52.794
[Benedict chuckling]

52:54.045 --> 52:56.298
…it is time for a toast.

52:56.381 --> 52:58.758
A good idea. To cheer our guests.

52:58.842 --> 53:02.888
-[sighs]
-Or to tend to other pressing matters.

53:10.228 --> 53:12.689
My-- I believe my sister
and I have grown rather weary.

53:12.772 --> 53:14.524
A toast. Yes.

53:15.358 --> 53:16.318
[clears throat]

53:18.028 --> 53:20.989
My sincere gratitude
to the Sharmas for joining us.

53:21.531 --> 53:24.117
It has been splendid having you here

53:24.201 --> 53:28.371
to witness what is now
my second annual loss at pall-mall.

53:28.455 --> 53:31.583
-[light laughter]
-Not to be repeated, I assure you.

53:33.585 --> 53:36.671
And my special gratitude to Miss Edwina.

53:38.173 --> 53:39.799
It has certainly been a privilege

53:39.883 --> 53:42.093
to truly make your acquaintance
these past days.

53:42.719 --> 53:43.553
In fact,

53:43.637 --> 53:47.307
I believe there is a question
I would like to ask you.

54:00.028 --> 54:01.279
I should like to, uh…

54:08.787 --> 54:10.956
I should like to ask you to please

54:11.039 --> 54:14.459
refrain from telling anyone
back in London about yesterday's loss.

54:14.542 --> 54:18.672
I fear the harm to my reputation
would simply be too great.

54:18.755 --> 54:20.423
-[awkward chuckling]
-Um…

54:20.507 --> 54:22.008
To the pleasant days ahead.

54:22.092 --> 54:24.177
-Uh, pleasant days.
-Hear! Hear!

54:24.261 --> 54:26.429
-[Colin] Days ahead.
-[Benedict] Hear! Hear!

54:27.055 --> 54:27.889
Yes.

54:32.852 --> 54:34.020
[Colin] Mm.

54:34.813 --> 54:35.939
[exhales deeply]

55:02.215 --> 55:05.468
-You must know you did nothing wrong.
-I must have done something.

55:07.345 --> 55:10.265
The rest of the ton
are now set to join us in the country.

55:11.683 --> 55:14.728
Surely, if the viscount were to propose,
he'd have done it by now. Yes?

55:17.314 --> 55:19.357
-What if I have missed my chance?
-Edwina.

55:19.441 --> 55:21.901
Perhaps I should've found out
more about the Bridgertons.

55:21.985 --> 55:24.529
I should've known more
about their interests.

55:24.612 --> 55:26.364
[loudly] I should've been better.

55:31.077 --> 55:32.996
[breathing shakily]

55:33.079 --> 55:35.749
[crying softly]
I have bungled this entire affair.

55:37.917 --> 55:40.295
[inhales shakily]
And now I feel like a fool.

55:41.421 --> 55:42.297
[sighs]

55:42.380 --> 55:43.840
Never say such a thing, Bon.

55:44.591 --> 55:47.761
I knew he would only end up
hurting you. Come here.

55:51.973 --> 55:53.558
[breathes shakily, sniffles]

55:53.641 --> 55:55.560
I hate seeing you like this.

55:56.061 --> 55:56.936
[sobs softly]

55:57.020 --> 55:58.855
I thought he liked me.

55:59.773 --> 56:00.732
[Kate sighs]

56:04.069 --> 56:06.321
You are the diamond of the season.

56:07.155 --> 56:10.867
There is nary a gentleman back in London
who does not wish for your hand.

56:10.950 --> 56:12.243
[chuckles, sniffles]

56:13.953 --> 56:15.580
You have choices, Bon.

56:17.665 --> 56:18.500
All will be well,

56:18.583 --> 56:21.711
despite this disappointment
with the viscount, I assure you.

56:47.320 --> 56:48.738
[knocking at door]

56:50.365 --> 56:51.408
Are you still up?

56:51.908 --> 56:54.744
Ugh. You may wish to bathe
before you see Mother in the morning.

56:54.828 --> 56:56.162
It's magical, Brother.

56:57.330 --> 56:58.581
You were right.

56:58.665 --> 57:00.834
I've allowed my doubts
to plague me for too long.

57:00.917 --> 57:04.170
The Royal Academy Schools are not
the arbiters of taste. The world is!

57:04.254 --> 57:06.256
[scoffs] You are a fatwit.

57:06.339 --> 57:08.800
Benedict, something
has apparently arrived for you.

57:08.883 --> 57:10.176
A letter from London.

57:13.930 --> 57:15.557
[muttering]

57:20.603 --> 57:21.438
I have a place.

57:22.397 --> 57:25.358
[chuckles] The Royal Schools
have accepted me as a student.

57:25.442 --> 57:27.986
[sobs, shouts] I got in!

57:28.069 --> 57:30.238
I thought they were not
the arbiters of taste?

57:30.321 --> 57:33.575
They must see great promise
in my work. Oh my!

57:35.410 --> 57:38.079
You shall all bear witness

57:38.163 --> 57:40.206
to my talents!

57:40.290 --> 57:42.000
Shh! It's the middle of the night!

57:42.083 --> 57:44.085
-[laughing]
-[dog barking]

57:44.752 --> 57:47.213
He will be as insufferable now as you.

57:47.297 --> 57:48.131
Me?

57:48.214 --> 57:51.217
If I must hear one more tale of your
extraordinary adventures from Greece…

57:51.301 --> 57:54.846
Tell me, Brother, if you loved it there
so much, why did you ever return home?

57:56.431 --> 57:57.265
Well…

57:58.308 --> 58:00.018
Do you ever hear from her?

58:00.101 --> 58:01.311
Miss Thompson?

58:02.645 --> 58:04.814
Are you ladies not always writing letters?

58:04.898 --> 58:07.775
[scoffs] I'd have thought
your travels banished Miss Thompson--

58:07.859 --> 58:10.612
Lady Crane, rather,
from your mind completely.

58:10.695 --> 58:13.281
Funny how distance
is no match for memory, is it not?

58:15.575 --> 58:17.076
She lives not far from here, you know.

58:19.204 --> 58:21.956
[Benedict] "I am honored to accept

58:23.249 --> 58:24.751
your acceptance."

58:25.627 --> 58:27.462
You think it will last much longer?

58:28.254 --> 58:29.547
Well, devil if I know.

58:30.131 --> 58:34.135
[Lady Whistledown] An artist
must be free to follow their muse.

58:36.095 --> 58:40.642
But it appears the ton has fallen prey
to the fickleness of fashion.

58:42.101 --> 58:44.979
For how else might one explain the tawdry,

58:45.063 --> 58:50.026
dare I say vulgar, gown sported
lately by Miss Cressida Cowper?

58:55.448 --> 58:58.284
Mayfair's newest modiste

58:58.368 --> 59:01.538
has one thing,
and one thing only, going for her.

59:01.621 --> 59:02.747
She is new.

59:03.373 --> 59:06.417
Whereas Madame Delacroix might be old,

59:06.501 --> 59:08.795
but at least she is capable.

59:08.878 --> 59:09.879
[door opens]

59:11.548 --> 59:13.550
You may leave the silks there.

59:20.139 --> 59:21.266
Miss Penelope.

59:21.349 --> 59:24.143
[Penelope] It is your job
to be observant, is it not?

59:25.436 --> 59:28.314
To hide your clients' secrets
with a well-draped piece of fabric

59:28.398 --> 59:30.191
or a cleverly embellished rosette,

59:31.693 --> 59:33.111
just as I too hide.

59:34.654 --> 59:35.488
Behind my pen.

59:37.365 --> 59:39.909
I have no interest
in revealing your identity.

59:39.993 --> 59:41.619
That is not why I'm here.

59:42.370 --> 59:44.789
I believe I can trust you,
Madame Delacroix.

59:46.165 --> 59:48.793
In a world of men,
you have built a thriving business,

59:48.876 --> 59:50.169
much like myself.

59:50.253 --> 59:52.255
I think we can be of use to one another.

59:54.674 --> 59:57.969
My enterprise grows more difficult
for me to maintain on my own.

59:58.553 --> 1:00:02.682
If I was spotted by you so easily,
it is only so long before I get recognized

1:00:02.765 --> 1:00:05.184
by someone… less discreet.

1:00:05.268 --> 1:00:06.102
[sighs]

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:09.856
I have proved to you
how I can help you in your business.

1:00:10.982 --> 1:00:12.942
Now I'd like you to help me with mine.

1:00:16.237 --> 1:00:18.072
Did you have to call me old?

1:00:20.533 --> 1:00:22.827
I could not be
so obvious with my flattery.

1:00:24.037 --> 1:00:25.204
But is it not working?

1:00:25.288 --> 1:00:28.249
Madame Delacroix?
I require your expert knowledge.

1:00:28.333 --> 1:00:29.959
I believe I was first.

1:00:34.005 --> 1:00:38.968
[Lady Whistledown] Of course, not everyone
can always get things so right.

1:00:48.978 --> 1:00:50.229
[growls]

1:01:06.037 --> 1:01:07.872
[Lady Whistledown]
Though I suppose, for some,

1:01:07.955 --> 1:01:10.833
it may be simply too late to change course

1:01:10.917 --> 1:01:12.960
and undo any damage.

1:01:14.587 --> 1:01:16.255
[exhales deeply]

1:01:16.839 --> 1:01:17.840
Whoa.

1:01:30.645 --> 1:01:31.479
[horse snorts]

1:01:39.112 --> 1:01:39.946
My lord.

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:42.281
Miss Sharma.

1:01:44.158 --> 1:01:45.368
Is your sister…

1:01:46.786 --> 1:01:48.121
She is in her room.

1:01:49.580 --> 1:01:51.958
Not feeling her best
this morning, it seems.

1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:55.920
I did not mean
to disappoint her last night

1:01:56.462 --> 1:01:58.047
when I did not declare myself.

1:01:59.382 --> 1:02:00.800
And I'd like to thank you for not--

1:02:00.883 --> 1:02:03.970
She shall not be disappointed for long.
Assure her, I still intend to propose.

1:02:05.430 --> 1:02:08.975
Last night was a lark, at best.
My brothers were up to no good, and

1:02:09.809 --> 1:02:12.770
with everyone sitting there,
staring back at me, well…

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:16.649
my feelings would not allow me to speak.

1:02:19.485 --> 1:02:22.780
So your feelings
are too strong for you now?

1:02:22.864 --> 1:02:24.741
-Miss Sharma--
-No. No.

1:02:24.824 --> 1:02:26.284
All you are doing, my lord,

1:02:26.367 --> 1:02:29.120
is toying with the emotions
of an impressionable young lady.

1:02:29.203 --> 1:02:32.331
Miss Edwina seems perfectly capable
of forming her own impressions.

1:02:32.415 --> 1:02:33.416
If you took notice--

1:02:33.499 --> 1:02:35.710
So now you claim
to know my sister better than me?

1:02:35.793 --> 1:02:37.336
I know she wishes to be happy.

1:02:38.755 --> 1:02:40.965
This is precisely what I wish for her.

1:02:41.048 --> 1:02:44.260
I can assure you,
happiness is not your strength.

1:02:44.343 --> 1:02:47.346
Exasperation, perhaps.
Fixation, most definitely.

1:02:47.430 --> 1:02:50.016
The only feeling you are, in fact,

1:02:50.099 --> 1:02:52.769
capable of engendering,
my lord, is that of discontent.

1:02:52.852 --> 1:02:55.688
-Do not move. Stand still, damn it!
-Do not tell me what to do!

1:02:55.772 --> 1:02:57.231
[Anthony panting]

1:02:58.941 --> 1:03:00.026
[buzzing]

1:03:02.779 --> 1:03:05.031
-No! Do not! Leave it!
-It is only a bee. Ow!

1:03:07.950 --> 1:03:09.035
[sighs]

1:03:09.118 --> 1:03:10.578
-Are you hurt?
-What?

1:03:10.661 --> 1:03:11.913
Can you breathe?

1:03:11.996 --> 1:03:13.581
It is only a sting. Of course.

1:03:13.664 --> 1:03:14.749
Are you certain?

1:03:16.334 --> 1:03:18.377
-My lord?
-No, no. Do not--

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:19.462
[panting]

1:03:19.545 --> 1:03:20.630
-My lord?
-Do not--

1:03:20.713 --> 1:03:22.715
[panting]

1:03:23.257 --> 1:03:24.509
I am unharmed.

1:03:24.592 --> 1:03:25.968
[panting]

1:03:26.052 --> 1:03:27.428
I am unharmed.

1:03:28.888 --> 1:03:31.390
[breathing calms]

1:03:38.773 --> 1:03:41.776
[whispering] It was just a bee.

1:03:43.194 --> 1:03:44.445
[whispers] It was a bee.

1:03:46.781 --> 1:03:48.991
[hearts beating steadily]

1:04:01.128 --> 1:04:02.713
[horse neighs]

1:04:02.797 --> 1:04:05.466
[indistinct chatter in distance]

1:04:08.511 --> 1:04:10.513
[horse neighing]

1:04:11.597 --> 1:04:13.599
[tense music plays]

1:04:15.351 --> 1:04:17.353
[panting]

1:04:22.108 --> 1:04:23.943
[panting]

1:04:38.082 --> 1:04:39.125
[sighs]
