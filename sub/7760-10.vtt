00:45.779 --> 00:49.683
- MAN CANNOT LIVE ON
THE BACK ROOM OF BABYLON ALONE.

00:49.717 --> 00:53.053
IT'LL BE FUN TO FUCK SOMEPLACE
DIFFERENT FOR A CHANGE.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.426
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

00:58.459 --> 01:01.729
- HOW THE FUCK DO I KNOW?

01:02.796 --> 01:04.198
COME ON.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.334
- SHIT.
THEM TOO?

01:06.367 --> 01:09.837
- WELL, LET'S TRY THE ADONIS.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.339
- "COME AGAIN."

01:11.372 --> 01:13.174
THE QUESTION IS, WHERE?

01:13.207 --> 01:15.343
[siren chirps]

01:15.376 --> 01:17.511
- WHAT ARE YOU BOYS UP TO?

01:17.545 --> 01:20.448
- WE'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR A GOOD PLACE TO FUCK.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.449
KNOW OF ANY?

01:21.482 --> 01:23.217
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?

01:23.251 --> 01:24.585
- 19.

01:24.618 --> 01:28.256
- LET ME SEE SOME I.D.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.224
- [sighs]

01:33.827 --> 01:35.529
[sniffling]

01:35.563 --> 01:37.465
YOU WERE HOPING
FOR SOMETHING YOUNGER?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.600
- ARE YOU HOPING TO CALL
YOUR LAWYER TONIGHT

01:39.633 --> 01:41.202
FROM A HOLDING CELL
AT THE PRECINCT?

01:41.235 --> 01:43.404
- UH, HE'S JUST
A LITTLE RAMBUNCTIOUS, OFFICER.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.640
YOU KNOW HOW THEY ARE
AT HIS AGE.

01:48.242 --> 01:52.780
- GO HOME, BOYS.
THE PARTY'S OVER.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.749
[police radio chatter]
- [grunts]

01:55.783 --> 01:57.818
IT'S BECOME
A BONA FIDE POLICE STATE HERE

01:57.851 --> 02:00.788
IN BEAUTIFUL
LOSS-OF-LIBERTY AVENUE.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.825
SOMETHING'S GOTTA BE DONE.

02:04.858 --> 02:08.262
- YEAH.
ME.

02:12.733 --> 02:18.539
[moaning]

02:51.705 --> 02:54.808
- IT'S FOR THE BOYS
AT THE PRECINCT, JIM.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.177
- [laughing]

03:07.855 --> 03:10.424
MORNING, BOYS.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.560
- MISSED YOU AT BABYLON
LAST NIGHT.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.428
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT WAS SUCH A LOVELY EVENING,

03:14.462 --> 03:15.963
JUSTIN AND I DECIDED
TO TAKE A STROLL.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.865
- OH,
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.300
- I HEAR
IT WAS AN OVERFLOW CROWD.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.434
- FILLED TO CAPACITY.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.835
- WHAT WAS THE ENTICEMENT?

03:21.869 --> 03:24.438
FREE AIRLINE MILES
FOR EVERY COCK YOU SUCK?

03:24.472 --> 03:25.839
- [chuckles]
THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.708
STOCKWELL'S CLOSED DOWN
HALF THE STREET.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.577
- AND YOU'VE EMPOWERED HIM
TO DO IT.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.445
- FRANKLY,
HE'S DOING US A FAVOR.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.914
THE GRAVEL PIT
WAS ALWAYS A SKANK HOLE.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.783
THE ONLY THING I EVER PICKED UP
THERE WAS A CASE OF CRABS.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.751
THE BATHS WERE ALWAYS
FULL OF TROLLS,

03:37.785 --> 03:40.454
AND THE ADONIS HADN'T CLEANED
THE CUM OFF THEIR FLOORS

03:40.488 --> 03:41.622
SINCE THE DAY THEY OPENED.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.324
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.925
OUR WORLD'S BEING TAKEN AWAY
FROM US.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.795
- AND THAT INCLUDES OUR RIGHT
TO FUCK WHEREVER WE WANT.

03:47.828 --> 03:48.896
I THOUGHT
SOMEHOW THAT MIGHT HAVE

03:48.929 --> 03:50.030
PERSONAL SIGNIFICANCE
FOR YOU.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.499
- THE ONLY THING THAT HAS

03:51.532 --> 03:52.800
PERSONAL SIGNIFICANCE TO HIM

03:52.833 --> 03:53.801
IS SIGNING UP
STOCKWELL'S BACKERS

03:53.834 --> 03:55.369
AND MOVING TO NEW YORK.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.537
- [clicks tongue]

03:56.570 --> 03:58.472
- OKAY,
WILL YOU PLEASE CALM DOWN?

03:58.506 --> 03:59.673
- NO, I WILL NOT CALM DOWN!
- I AM JUST DOING WHAT I'M TOLD.

03:59.707 --> 04:00.908
- BE RIGHT BACK.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:00.941 --> 04:03.010
I WANT TO SEE
THE FUCKING MANAGER NOW.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.745
NOW!

04:04.778 --> 04:06.013
- HEY, HEY, HEY, W-WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:06.046 --> 04:07.415
- THEY WON'T LET ME IN.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.882
- WE GOT
AN INSUFFICIENT FUNDS NOTICE

04:08.916 --> 04:10.484
FROM THE BANK WHEN WE TRIED
TO BILL HIS ACCOUNT.

04:10.518 --> 04:11.752
- THAT'S BULLSHIT.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.354
- I'M SURE
IT'S JUST A MIX-UP.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.355
WE WILL GET YOU
A GUEST MEMBERSHIP FOR NOW.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.623
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:15.656 --> 04:17.958
I'VE BEEN COMING HERE
FOR NINE YEARS.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.893
NINE YEARS!

04:19.927 --> 04:21.795
YOU'D THINK YOU COULD SHOW
A LITTLE RESPECT.

04:21.829 --> 04:25.966
WELL, FUCK YOU
AND YOUR MEMBERSHIP.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.669
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.438
- HONEY,
YOU SHOULD SEE THE CARNAGE

04:30.471 --> 04:33.641
WHEN YOGA SELLS OUT.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.676
- READY FOR THE ROWING MACHINE?
- OH, YEAH.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.379
[indistinct chatter]

04:38.412 --> 04:39.680
- POOR TEDDY.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.515
THESE DAYS,
THE SLIGHTEST LITTLE AFFRONT

04:41.549 --> 04:42.716
IS LIKE A KNIFE
IN HIS HEART.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.052
- MAYBE WHAT HE NEEDS IS
A VACATION.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.788
- MAYBE WHAT HE NEEDS IS
AN INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH VALIUM.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.390
- VALIUM?

04:49.423 --> 04:50.791
- WELL, LOOK AT IT.
IT'S BEATING SO FAST.

04:50.824 --> 04:51.992
- OH, THAT'S QUITE NORMAL.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.461
PREGNANCY'S HARD WORK,

04:53.494 --> 04:54.928
FOR BOTH THE CHILD
AND THE MOTHER.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.564
- ESPECIALLY
AFTER MELANIE'S ENDOMETRIOSIS.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.399
- ENDOMETRI-WHAT?

04:58.432 --> 05:00.401
- YOU'LL PROBABLY DISCOVER
THAT THE PAIN WILL SUBSIDE

05:00.434 --> 05:01.835
DURING THE PREGNANCY.
- PAIN? WHAT PAIN?

05:01.869 --> 05:04.004
- BUT IN THE MEANTIME, SHE
SHOULD STILL BE TAKING IT EASY,

05:04.037 --> 05:05.839
RIGHT, DOCTOR?
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

05:05.873 --> 05:07.708
- EVERYONE,
PLEASE STOP WORRYING.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.410
- I AM NOT WORRYING.
- I AM!

05:09.443 --> 05:10.711
- I WAS JUST MAKING
A SUGGESTION.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.413
- THERE'S NO HARM
IN TAKING IT EASY.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.714
- SHE'S PRACTICALLY
WORKING HERSELF

05:13.747 --> 05:15.549
INTO A STATE OF EXHAUSTION.
- WHAT?

05:15.583 --> 05:17.818
- I'M NOT WORKING MYSELF
INTO A STATE OF EXHAUSTION.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.820
- PLEASE.
SHE THINKS SHE CAN DO IT ALL.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.489
- BECAUSE I CAN.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.990
- YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL,
MELANIE,

05:23.023 --> 05:24.425
NOT TO OVERDO.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.560
TOO MUCH STRESS,
NOT EATING PROPERLY,

05:26.594 --> 05:27.995
THESE ALL CAN LEAD
TO SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.431
- JESUS.

05:30.464 --> 05:31.765
- I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.
I REALLY DO.

05:31.799 --> 05:32.966
IT'S JUST MY DARLING,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.968
DEVOTED PARTNER
SIMPLY OVERREACTING

05:35.002 --> 05:37.471
AND DRIVING ME NUTS.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.707
- YOU'D THINK WITH
ALL THE CHRONIC MASTURBATION,

05:39.740 --> 05:40.774
HE'D BE CALM,

05:40.808 --> 05:42.576
BUT HE'S A JANGLE OF NERVES.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.479
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.
MEL'S RUNNING HERSELF RAGGED.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.914
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
WHEN YOU'RE ALWAYS ON THE RAG.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.716
- THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO, OKAY?

05:48.749 --> 05:50.017
SHE'S THE ONE
CARRYING THE BABY.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.452
- OUR BABY.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.454
- SO?
DID YOU SEE IT?

05:53.487 --> 05:55.456
YOU KNOW, WHAT--
WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?

05:55.489 --> 05:58.459
- DID IT HAVE YOUR CUTE LITTLE
TURNED-UP NOSE AND BUTTON EYES

05:58.492 --> 06:00.561
AND PERFECTLY SHAPED PENIS?

06:00.594 --> 06:02.630
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?
- HEY, HEY!

06:02.663 --> 06:04.765
- IT'S THE SIZE OF A PEANUT.
[phone ringing]

06:04.798 --> 06:06.734
THE BABY.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.637
I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING.
IT'S REALLY FUCKIN' AMAZING.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.872
- HELLO?

06:11.905 --> 06:14.542
YES.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.678
MY WHAT?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.981
OH.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.386
WELL, IS HE ALL RIGHT?

06:28.055 --> 06:30.524
YEAH, NO, I SEE.

06:30.558 --> 06:33.761
I TEACH UNTIL 3:00,
BUT I CAN BE THERE AFTER THAT.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.796
YEAH, THANK YOU.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.165
[phone beeps]
- IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

06:38.198 --> 06:40.668
- YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.637
UM, I WILL SEE YOU LATER.

06:43.671 --> 06:47.441
PLEASE STOP WORRYING.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.776
- WHO'S WORRYING?

06:48.809 --> 06:51.178
THAT'S MY JOB,
DAMN IT.

06:51.211 --> 06:54.214
- MELANIE'S WORKING TOO HARD,
AND MICHAEL--

06:54.247 --> 06:57.618
MICHAEL'S WORRIED
FOR THE LIFE OF HIS CHILD.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.092
- SWEETHEART,
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.529
ONCE UPON
A GODFORSAKEN TIME,

07:08.562 --> 07:11.098
THERE WAS
A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS,

07:11.131 --> 07:12.800
AND SHE WORKED HER ASS OFF

07:12.833 --> 07:14.535
UNTIL THE DAY
SHE POPPED HER KID.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.605
AND SHE WENT BACK TO WORK
THREE DAYS LATER.

07:17.638 --> 07:21.108
- THAT DIANA
WAS AN INSPIRATION.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.743
- THE BOTTOM LINE IS,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.678
I COULDN'T AFFORD THE LUXURY
OF NOT WORKING.

07:24.712 --> 07:25.679
I HAD TO EARN A LIVING.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.948
- YEAH, BUT YOU WERE 17.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.017
MEL'S IN HER 30s,
AND SHE'S GOT

07:30.050 --> 07:32.152
ENDOMETRI-WHATEVER-
THE-FUCK-IT'S-CALLED,

07:32.185 --> 07:35.255
AND NOW SHE'S TAKEN ON THE
BIGGEST COURT CASE OF HER LIFE.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.559
- YEAH, AND DON'T FORGET,
SHE'S A CWAZY WESBIAN.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.961
- NOW DO YOU SEE
WHY I'M WORRIED?

07:40.994 --> 07:43.030
WELL?

07:43.063 --> 07:45.899
SAY SOMETHING.
[bell rings]

07:45.933 --> 07:47.968
- SOMEBODY BETTER KEEP
AN EYE ON THAT GIRL.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.738
- OH, MY GOD.
NOW I REALLY NEED A VALIUM.

07:50.771 --> 07:54.575
- "TRY DISCOUNT VIAGRA."

07:54.608 --> 07:56.877
"WATCH TEENAGE GIRLS DOING IT
WITH FARM ANIMALS."

07:56.910 --> 07:57.878
WHOO-HOO.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.714
I CAN HARDLY WAIT.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.183
"REFINANCE YOUR HOME."

08:03.216 --> 08:06.720
LIKE I NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.122
"UNDERGROUND SEX PARTY."

08:09.156 --> 08:12.059
WHAT, WITH CORPSES?

08:12.092 --> 08:13.794
[sighs]

08:13.827 --> 08:15.028
"YOU'VE RECEIVED THIS
'CAUSE YOU'RE ONE

08:15.062 --> 08:18.065
OF PITTSBURGH'S
HOTTEST SEX PIGS."

08:18.098 --> 08:21.268
BOY, DOES YOUR LIST
NEED UPDATING.

08:21.301 --> 08:24.037
"COME JOIN THE HOTTEST SEX PARTY
IN TOWN TOMORROW

08:24.071 --> 08:25.873
AT THE PARADISE MOTEL."

08:25.906 --> 08:28.275
UGH, THAT FILTHY,
PESTILENCE-RIDDEN HOLE?

08:28.308 --> 08:29.610
GOD, IF THEY WANT
TO CLOSE SOME PLACE,

08:29.643 --> 08:31.044
WHY DON'T THEY CLOSE THAT?

08:31.078 --> 08:32.680
[door opens]
WELL, SORRY, BOYS.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.815
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PARTY
WITHOUT ME.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.150
- WELL, IT'S ALL CONFIRMED.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.152
OUR RESERVATION
AT THE MAPLE LEAF INN.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.021
- EM, I TOLD YOU,
I CAN'T AFFORD

08:41.054 --> 08:42.756
TO GO TO THE COUNTRY,
NOT EVEN FOR A NIGHT.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.158
- AND I TOLD YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.560
IT'S MY TREAT.

08:46.594 --> 08:47.561
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TREAT ME.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.762
I'M NOT A CHARITY CASE.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.764
- [sighs]
- ACTUALLY I AM.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.199
[bottles clink]
- TEDDY...

08:52.232 --> 08:53.967
HOW MANY TIMES
WERE YOU THERE FOR ME

08:54.001 --> 08:55.769
WHEN I COULDN'T EVEN AFFORD
TO PAY MY PHONE BILL?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.104
NOW IT IS MY TURN

08:57.137 --> 08:59.106
TO BE THERE FOR YOU.
[puts keys on table]

08:59.139 --> 09:00.941
COME ON,

09:00.974 --> 09:02.910
IT'LL DO YOU GOOD
TO GET AWAY,

09:02.943 --> 09:05.312
RELAX,
FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.780
- HMM,
THAT SHOULDN'T BE HARD TO DO,

09:06.814 --> 09:08.215
CONSIDERING I HAVE NOTHING.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.784
- AREN'T YOU FORGETTING
ONE THING?

09:10.818 --> 09:12.920
YOU STILL HAVE ME.

09:12.953 --> 09:13.921
[musical ringtone]

09:13.954 --> 09:16.223
OOH, GOD.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.727
[phone beeps]

09:19.760 --> 09:24.665
HELLO?
YES, THIS IS HE.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.067
OH, I'D BE DELIGHTED.
[chuckles]

09:27.100 --> 09:28.702
UH, UH, TOMORROW?

09:28.736 --> 09:30.971
OH, ACTUALLY, UM,
TOMORROW'S NOT GOOD.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.708
MM, I--I SEE.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.343
WELL, LET'S SAY
AROUND 2:00 THEN.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.979
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.380
OKAY.
[chuckles]

09:40.413 --> 09:43.383
YOU WILL NEVER GUESS
WHO THAT WAS.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.820
THAT WAS
MRS. HENRY ASHCROFT III.

09:46.854 --> 09:50.357
WIFE OF HENRY ASHCROFT III.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.993
ANYWAY, UH, SHE HEARD ABOUT ME
FROM ONE OF HER FRIENDS

09:53.026 --> 09:54.828
AND WANTS ME TO DO
HER NEXT PARTY.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.965
- OH, MY, MY, YOUR STAR
IS CERTAINLY ON THE ASCENDANT.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.367
- THE ONLY TROUBLE IS, UH,

10:00.400 --> 10:04.705
SHE INSISTS,
INSISTS, INSISTS

10:04.738 --> 10:07.775
THAT I MEET
WITH HER TOMORROW.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.242
IT'S THE ONLY TIME
SHE HAS.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.879
- WELL, SO MUCH FOR ENJOYING
THE BUCOLIC CHARM

10:11.912 --> 10:14.247
OF RURAL PENNSYLVANIA.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.783
- NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:15.816 --> 10:17.184
I WANT YOU TO GO ANYWAY.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.852
- I'M NOT GOING
WITHOUT YOU,

10:18.886 --> 10:20.253
ESPECIALLY
SINCE YOU'RE PAYING.

10:20.287 --> 10:24.391
- WELL, IT MIGHT BE
EVEN BETTER THIS WAY.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.293
YOU NEED SOME TIME ALONE

10:26.326 --> 10:29.863
TO COMMUNE WITH NATURE,

10:29.897 --> 10:31.965
WITH YOUR SOUL.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.909
- WHAT THE FUCK
TOOK YOU SO LONG?

10:41.942 --> 10:45.345
- IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU TOO.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.414
SO I GOT A CALL

10:47.447 --> 10:49.416
TELLING ME MY NEPHEW
WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.219
WHICH WAS SURPRISING,
SINCE I DON'T HAVE A NEPHEW.

10:52.252 --> 10:55.789
- YOU DO NOW...
UNC.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.327
- WELL, SINCE WE'RE RELATED,

11:00.360 --> 11:03.196
YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:03.230 --> 11:06.333
- THE DOCTOR SAYS I HAVE
SOME KIND OF KIDNEY INFECTION.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.169
- HMM.
- HURTS LIKE HELL.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.171
- I HEAR THEY CAN BE
PRETTY PAINFUL.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.240
- I PASSED OUT
RIGHT ON THE SIDEWALK.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.908
AFTER LAYING THERE
FOR AN HOUR,

11:14.942 --> 11:19.179
SOMEBODY FINALLY BOTHERED
TO CALL AN AMBULANCE.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.048
- WELL, AT LEAST
YOU'RE HERE NOW.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.984
I'M SURE THAT
THEY'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.453
- THEY WANTED TO KNOW THE NAME
OF MY PARENT OR GUARDIAN,

11:26.486 --> 11:28.121
SO I GAVE THEM YOURS.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.857
- [sighs]

11:29.890 --> 11:32.359
- WELL, YOU SAID I SHOULD CALL
IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.794
THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.730
- I AM NOT GONNA LIE
TO THEM,

11:36.764 --> 11:37.731
GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE,

11:37.765 --> 11:39.900
YOU AS WELL.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.736
I BETTER GO EXPLAIN
TO THEM THAT--

11:42.770 --> 11:44.404
- NO, WAIT,
IF YOU TELL THEM

11:44.437 --> 11:45.939
YOU'RE NOT MY UNCLE,
THEY'LL CALL THE POLICE.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.274
THEY'LL PUT ME BACK
IN THE SYSTEM.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.342
- HUNTER, THAT MAY NOT BE
THE WORST THING.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.812
- YOU THINK SO?
I TOLD YOU WHAT IT WAS LIKE.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.881
WEREN'T YOU LISTENING?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.115
- I'M SURE THERE MUST BE
SOME DECENT FAMILIES.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.950
- THEY'RE NOT GONNA WANT ME.

11:56.984 --> 12:00.387
THEY'RE GONNA WANT SOME CUTE
LITTLE THREE-YEAR-OLD.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.223
I GET TO ROT IN SOME COUNTY HOME
WITH THE OTHER REJECTS.

12:03.256 --> 12:07.060
- WELL, THERE MUST BE
SOME OTHER SOLUTION.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.263
HUNTER, I'M SORRY.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.966
- WHY'D YOU EVEN BOTHER
GIVING ME YOUR NUMBER, ASSHOLE?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.135
SO YOU'D FEEL LIKE
SOME FUCKING DO-GOODER?

12:15.168 --> 12:19.139
NEXT TIME,
DON'T EVEN BOTHER.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.277
- UH, YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.880
- YOU'RE HUNTER'S UNCLE?

12:26.914 --> 12:30.050
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO FILL OUT SOME FORMS.
