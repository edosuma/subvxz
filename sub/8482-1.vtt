11:30.523 --> 11:32.259
I'M FROM CONNECTICUT,

11:32.259 --> 11:33.560
AND THIS, UM...

11:33.560 --> 11:36.663
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS,
BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T SHOW.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.932
THIS IS CALLED
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

11:38.932 --> 11:44.371
* IF YOU COULD
READ MY MIND *

11:44.371 --> 11:48.308
* YOU'D KNOW
HOW HARD I TRY *

11:48.308 --> 11:52.612
* BUT LOSIN'
WAS NOT MY PLAN *

11:52.612 --> 11:56.083
* AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND *

11:56.083 --> 12:01.021
* WITH ALL THOSE
TEARS I CRIED *

12:01.021 --> 12:04.324
* I SHOULD'VE REALIZED *

12:04.324 --> 12:07.961
* THAT I'D NEVER
HOLD YOU AGAIN *

12:07.961 --> 12:12.866
* AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND *

12:14.101 --> 12:17.971
* I CAN'T UNDERSTAND *

12:17.971 --> 12:22.642
* WHY YOU LEFT
MY LOVE BEHIND *

12:22.642 --> 12:26.113
* I CAN'T UNDERSTAND *

12:26.113 --> 12:31.051
* BUT I'LL LOVE YOU
TILL THE END OF TIME *

12:31.051 --> 12:32.820
* I SEARCH MY MEMORY *

12:32.820 --> 12:36.623
ALL RIGHT, UH,
JAMES WRIGHT.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.025
OH, I'M SO NERVOUS,

12:38.025 --> 12:39.726
I CAN HARDLY STAND.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.394
YOU OUGHT TO BE.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.433
I ALREADY SOLD THIS SONG,

12:46.433 --> 12:49.702
AND I WROTE IT
FOR A WOMAN TO SING,

12:49.702 --> 12:51.371
BUT WHAT THE HELL?

12:57.410 --> 13:03.550
* YOU GOT A THING OR TWO
TO LEARN ABOUT ME, BABY *

13:03.550 --> 13:07.020
* 'CAUSE I AIN'T
TAKIN' IT NO MORE *

13:07.020 --> 13:10.223
* AND I DON'T MEAN MAYBE *

13:10.223 --> 13:13.026
* YOU DON'T KNOW
RIGHT FROM WRONG *

13:13.026 --> 13:15.628
* THE LOVE WE HAD IS GONE *

13:15.628 --> 13:19.532
* SO BLAME IT ON
YOUR LYIN', CHEATIN' *

13:19.532 --> 13:20.834
* COLD, DEAD-BEATIN' *

13:20.834 --> 13:23.236
* TWO-TIMIN',
DOUBLE-DEALIN' *

13:23.236 --> 13:26.473
* MEAN, MISTREATIN',
LOVIN' HEART *

13:28.375 --> 13:34.948
* WELL, ALL I WANTED WAS
TO BE YOUR ONE AND ONLY *

13:34.948 --> 13:37.650
* BUT ALL I EVER
GOT FROM YOU *

13:37.650 --> 13:40.553
* WAS BEIN' LONELY *

13:40.553 --> 13:43.623
* NOW THAT
IS LAID TO REST *

13:43.623 --> 13:46.593
* 'CAUSE YOU HAVE
FAILED THE TEST *

13:46.593 --> 13:49.897
* HEY, BLAME IT ON
YOUR LYIN', CHEATIN' *

13:49.897 --> 13:53.066
* COLD, DEAD-BEATIN'
HEART *

13:53.066 --> 13:55.602
O.K., IF I CALL
YOUR NAME,

13:55.602 --> 13:58.205
IT MEANS YOU'RE PLAYING
HERE SATURDAY NIGHT.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.973
BE HERE BEFORE 7:00.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.808
NANCY BUTTERWORTH...

14:01.808 --> 14:02.842
NICK BARRETT...

14:02.842 --> 14:05.678
TOM MORTENSON...

14:05.678 --> 14:07.847
JANET HOGAN...

14:07.847 --> 14:09.116
JAMES WRIGHT...

14:09.116 --> 14:11.218
AND ROSS MILLER.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.320
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.698
MISS MIRANDA.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.500
COME OVER HERE
A SECOND.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.271
WE'RE JUST
CONGREGATING.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.977
CONGRATULATIONS.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.979
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.380
HEY, KYLE DAVIDSON.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.782
LINDA LUE, IS THAT
YOUR FACE I SEE?

14:42.782 --> 14:44.151
WELL, IT AIN'T
NOBODY'S BUTT.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.785
YOUR SONG
WAS PRETTY TONIGHT.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.120
PRETTY BAD?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.422
SO WHAT
DID YOU WANT?

14:51.324 --> 14:53.560
WHAT?

14:54.894 --> 14:59.066
I'M JUST LOOKING AT YOU
UP CLOSE.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.034
THERE WAS SOMETHING
THAT I--

15:01.034 --> 15:03.003
BUT YOU CHANGED
YOUR MIND?

15:03.003 --> 15:06.506
EXACTLY.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.941
I LIKED YOUR SONG.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.542
THANKS.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.543
I'M KYLE.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.445
I LIKED YOUR SONG.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.215
HI. MIRANDA.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.816
I LIKED YOURS, TOO.

15:16.816 --> 15:17.817
REALLY?

15:17.817 --> 15:19.619
YEAH.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.055
* SO WHEN WE MEET
AS FRIENDS *

15:22.055 --> 15:23.656
* MY HEART
WILL BREAK AGAIN *

15:23.656 --> 15:27.460
* IF THAT'S HOW
THE STORY ENDS *

15:27.460 --> 15:31.965
* THEN I CAN'T
UNDERSTAND *

15:31.965 --> 15:33.366
WOW.
WOW.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.969
WAS THAT EXACTLY
KYLE'S SONG?

15:35.969 --> 15:38.972
BECAUSE I HARDLY
EVEN RECOGNIZED IT.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.974
THAT WAS IT EXACTLY.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.375
YOU GOT A GREAT EAR.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.777
YOU GOT THAT FROM
HEARING ME SING IT?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.981
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF THE TERM "SING"
REALLY APPLIES--

15:47.981 --> 15:49.582
OH...OH...OH...

15:49.582 --> 15:51.051
HA HA HA!

15:51.051 --> 15:52.719
THEY BUILD YOU UP AND THEN,

15:52.719 --> 15:54.121
THEY JUST TEAR
YOU DOWN.

15:54.121 --> 15:58.058
LIKE THEY ALL GOT THE SAME
INSTRUCION MANUAL.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.227
NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU TOO.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.594
YOUR SONG WAS GREAT.

16:03.030 --> 16:06.166
DO YOU LADIES HAVE ANY
DESIRE TO ACCOMPANY US

16:06.166 --> 16:07.367
ON AN EXCURSION
INTO HISTORY?

16:07.367 --> 16:09.336
AND WHERE MIGHT
YOU BE GOING?

16:09.336 --> 16:11.504
A LITTLE MIDNIGHT RIDE
MAYBE.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.506
THIS, UH,
CONNECTICUT YANKEE KYLE

16:13.506 --> 16:16.609
WANTS TO WRITE
A COWBOY SONG.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.011
THAT'S RIGHT, MA'AM.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.612
YOU WANT TO GO?

16:19.612 --> 16:21.748
UH, YEAH.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.551
ALL RIGHT,
THEN LET'S GO,
LITTLE DOOGIES.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.952
DOGIES.

16:25.952 --> 16:26.953
DOOGIES.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.221
DOGIES. COME ON.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.822
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.224
HE'S SMILING FOR US.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.960
THAT'S NO SMILE.
THAT'S CONTEMPT.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.362
I HAD A THIRD COUSIN

16:35.362 --> 16:37.764
WHO USED TO BE
A RODEO CLOWN.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.967
FUNNY THING IS,
HE BROKE HIS NECK,
AND HE DIED.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.369
WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.371
I TOOK RIDING
AT SUMMER CAMP.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.774
YEAH, THE DUDE RANCH
IN, WHAT, NEW ENGLAND?

16:47.774 --> 16:48.775
[NEIGH]

16:48.775 --> 16:50.477
HEY, HO!

16:50.477 --> 16:51.744
WHOA!

16:51.744 --> 16:55.048
KYLE DAVIDSON,
YOU ARE A SIGHT
TO BEHOLD, BABY!

16:55.048 --> 16:57.484
WHOA!

17:01.521 --> 17:06.693
* THE OLD GRAY MARE, SHE
AIN'T WHAT SHE USED TO BE *

17:06.693 --> 17:08.494
LOOK AT ME--
IN THE EYES.

17:08.494 --> 17:11.098
HOW MANY FINGERS
AM I HOLDING UP?

17:11.098 --> 17:12.499
FOUR OR FIVE.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.101
HOW MANY BEATLES
WERE THERE?

17:14.101 --> 17:15.702
THREE--AND RINGO.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.104
ARE YOU O.K.?

17:17.104 --> 17:18.505
HE'S JUST
FUCKIN' WITH ME.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.507
JUST A MINOR
CONCUSSION,
THAT'S ALL.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.109
LINDA, CAN
YOU PLEASE GET
THE TRUCK?

17:23.109 --> 17:25.112
MAKE SURE
HE DOESN'T
FALL ASLEEP.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.214
GOT TO KEEP HIM
AWAKE AND CONSCIOUS.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.915
I'M JUST FINE.

17:28.915 --> 17:32.985
WE HAVE SOME WORK
ON THIS FENCE TO DO
FOR MR. WILSON.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.921
ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT, HONEY?

17:34.921 --> 17:38.125
THERE'S THIS TRADITION
WHEN YOU FIRST
GET TO NASHVILLE

17:38.125 --> 17:41.128
WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO
TO THE TALLEST MOUNTAIN

17:41.128 --> 17:43.130
OR THE TOP OF A BUILDING

17:43.130 --> 17:44.931
AND YELL,
"LOOK OUT, MUSIC CITY,

17:44.931 --> 17:47.734
'CAUSE I'M HERE
AND I AIN'T NEVER LEAVIN'!"

17:47.734 --> 17:49.136
THAT'S REAL NICE.

17:49.136 --> 17:52.139
I WASN'T SURE THAT SONG
WAS ANY GOOD

17:52.139 --> 17:54.541
UNTIL I HEARD YOU
SING IT TONIGHT.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.543
OH, KYLE, IT'S
A BEAUTIFUL SONG.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.146
WILL YOU DO
THE DEMO FOR ME,

17:59.146 --> 18:01.080
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
ANYBODY ELSE?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.682
I GOT THE CAR.

18:02.682 --> 18:03.483
I'M SORRY.

18:03.483 --> 18:06.153
PUT YOUR ARM
AROUND THERE.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.755
DR. ARLEN, REPORT
TO ROOM 5703.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.958
NOW, HONEY, I TOLD
YOU BEFORE HE'S
PERFECTLY FINE,

18:11.958 --> 18:13.360
BUT WE CAN'T
RELEASE HIM.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.962
COULD WE AT LEAST
TALK TO HIM?

18:15.962 --> 18:18.231
RELAX, AND I'LL
LET YOU KNOW.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.380
SO WHERE YOU
BEEN STAYING?

18:33.380 --> 18:36.583
UH, YOU KNOW
THAT MOTEL NEAR
THE BLUEBIRD?

18:36.583 --> 18:37.984
THE DRAKE?

18:37.984 --> 18:40.387
UNREAL. THAT'S WHERE
I'M STAYING.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.589
WHAT ROOM DID YOU GET?

18:42.589 --> 18:44.391
UH, ROOM 108.

18:44.391 --> 18:47.594
OH, MY GOD.
THE DREADFUL DISCO ROOM.

18:47.594 --> 18:48.995
HA HA!

18:48.995 --> 18:50.997
YEAH.
I KIND OF LIKE IT.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.400
YOU SHOULD SEE MINE.
IT IS SO GREAT.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.602
IT'S ALL DONE UP
AND EVERYTHING.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.003
IT LOOKS SUPER.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.005
COME OVER
AND SEE IT SOMETIME.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.006
MAYBE. YEAH.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.374
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:01.374 --> 19:02.775
I'M GETTING AN IDEA

19:02.775 --> 19:05.378
THAT SINCE WE'RE BOTH
AT THE SAME MOTEL,

19:05.378 --> 19:07.380
WHY DON'T WE
SHARE MY ROOM,

19:07.380 --> 19:09.982
AND THEN WE CAN
SAVE SOME MONEY?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.384
YOU JUST MET ME.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.386
YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW ME.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.388
I'M AN EXCELLENT
JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

19:15.388 --> 19:18.391
I HAVE A TOUCH
OF THE POWER, YOU KNOW.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.228
DADDY, LOOK AT ME.
ARE YOU O.K.?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.398
ARE YOU THE DOCTOR?

19:25.398 --> 19:26.866
YOU CAN'T COME IN.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.535
DADDY, I'LL WAIT, O.K.?

19:44.284 --> 19:47.086
* THE MORE I HURT *

19:47.086 --> 19:49.856
* THE LESS I FEEL *

19:49.856 --> 19:51.524
* THE MORE I KNOW *

19:51.524 --> 19:54.294
* THE LESS I REST
IN THIS *

19:55.295 --> 19:59.266
* LONE STAR *

19:59.266 --> 20:01.901
* STATE OF MINE *

20:03.436 --> 20:05.438
DID YOU WRITE THAT
YOURSELF?

20:05.438 --> 20:07.039
YEAH, JUST NOW...

20:07.039 --> 20:08.708
FOR YOU.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.845
TO BE HONEST, UM,

20:12.845 --> 20:18.318
I'M NOT PARTICULARLY
FOND OF HOSPITALS MYSELF.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.457
THE TRUTH IS...

20:24.457 --> 20:28.461
MY DAD WENT INTO
AN EMERGENCY ROOM,

20:28.461 --> 20:31.731
AND I NEVER
SAW HIM AGAIN.

20:37.937 --> 20:38.938
THAT'S HIM.

20:38.938 --> 20:42.709
HE LOOKS JUST
LIKE ELVIS.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.978
HE'S THE OTHER ONE
WHO DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE ELVIS.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.179
OH.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.982
HE GAVE THIS TO ME
WHEN I WAS 10.

20:49.982 --> 20:53.486
"MY DECITENNIAL
ACCOLADE," HE CALLED IT.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.489
HE HAD A NAME
FOR EVERYTHING.

20:56.489 --> 21:00.092
HE RAISED ME
SINCE I WAS 5...

21:00.092 --> 21:01.828
JUST ME AND HIM.

21:01.828 --> 21:05.298
SO WHERE WAS YOUR MOM
THROUGH ALL THIS?

21:05.298 --> 21:06.999
UH, SHE SPLIT...

21:08.335 --> 21:10.570
PRETTY EARLY ON.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.674
PRESLEY'S
MY MIDDLE NAME.

21:14.674 --> 21:19.045
HE HAD THIS THING--
MY DAD--ABOUT ELVIS.

21:19.045 --> 21:22.749
NOTHING WEIRD.

21:22.749 --> 21:27.053
HE ALWAYS WANTED TO
TAKE ME TO GRACELAND...

21:27.053 --> 21:30.022
BUT WE NEVER MADE IT.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.996
COME ON. THERE'S
SOMETHING I WANT TO DO.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.031
WHERE WE GOING, BABY?

21:39.031 --> 21:40.633
NOW, DON'T DO IT

21:40.633 --> 21:43.235
'CAUSE KYLE,
THAT PSEUDO HICK,
TOLD YOU TO.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.037
IT'S A GRAND OLD
NASHVILLE TRADITION.

21:45.037 --> 21:48.240
I BET HE TELLS THAT
TO ALL THE GIRLS

21:48.240 --> 21:50.242
WHO GET OFF
THE GREYHOUND BUS.

21:50.242 --> 21:51.644
TRADITIONS HAVE
TO START SOMEWHERE.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.480
LOOK OUT, MUSIC CITY,

21:53.480 --> 21:55.081
'CAUSE I'M HERE NOW

21:55.081 --> 21:56.483
AND I AIN'T NEVER LEAVING!

21:56.483 --> 21:59.085
THIS IS TERRIBLE.
I CANNOT WATCH THIS.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.487
LOOK OUT, MUSIC CITY,

22:00.487 --> 22:03.423
'CAUSE I'M HERE NOW
AND I AIN'T NEVER LEAVING!

22:03.423 --> 22:05.224
IT'S JUST SO DESPERATE.

22:05.224 --> 22:08.961
OH, WELL, IS THIS
ALL BENEATH YOU,
MR. COOL GUY?

22:08.961 --> 22:11.063
IT'S NOT THAT
I CAN'T DO IT.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.099
IN FACT, I CAN DO IT
BETTER THAN MOST.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.901
OH. WELL THEN.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.969
LOOK OUT, MUSIC CITY

22:16.969 --> 22:20.407
'CAUSE HERE I AM AND
I AIN'T NEVER LEAVING!

22:20.407 --> 22:32.852
LOOK OUT, MUSIC CITY,

22:32.852 --> 22:34.621
'CAUSE I'M HERE NOW
AND I AIN'T NEVER LEAVING!

SPOIL YOU
AS GOOD AS I CAN.

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:40.517
ELVIS?

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:41.518
MM-HMM.

01:03:41.518 --> 01:03:42.920
YOU CUT ELVIS' HAIR.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.921
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:45.522
NAH, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

01:03:45.522 --> 01:03:46.523
BELIEVE IT.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:47.925
YOU BELIEVE THAT, LUE?

01:03:47.925 --> 01:03:49.927
WHY WOULD HE
MAKE THAT UP?

01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:52.262
WHY DON'T YOU
GET YOUR HAIR CUT?

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:53.864
'CAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO.

01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:54.865
COME ON.

01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:56.266
I DON'T WANT TO.

01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:58.869
I'LL BE ELVIS,
AND YOU CAN BE PRISCILLA.

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:00.670
I DON'T WANT
TO BE PRISCILLA.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.273
I'M NOT DOING IT
'CAUSE YOU
WANT ME TO.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:05.876
I'M TIRED OF DOING
WHAT EVERYBODY
WANTS ME TO.

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:07.878
GOOD IDEA.
DON'T GET IT CUT.

01:04:07.878 --> 01:04:10.280
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME
WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.282
YOU MOVING OUT
OF THE MOTEL?

01:04:12.282 --> 01:04:14.684
WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY
EVER ASK ME WHAT I THINK?

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:17.287
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS
ASKING EVERYONE ELSE
WHAT THEY THINK.

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.489
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:20.891
I'M NOT DOING IT ANYMORE.

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:23.293
IF I DON'T FEEL LIKE
BEING NICE TO SOMEBODY,

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:25.695
THEN I'M GOING
TO START BEING MEAN--
OR IMPOLITE.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:28.098
IF I FEEL LIKE
TELLING SOMEBODY
WHAT I THINK,

01:04:28.098 --> 01:04:29.699
I'M GOING TO TELL THEM.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:32.903
AND BILLY THINKS
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
BECAUSE HE WANTS TO?

01:04:32.903 --> 01:04:34.304
WELL, I'M SORRY,

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:36.907
BUT I GOT TO BE
SOMETHING MYSELF

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:38.909
BEFORE I CAN BE
SOMEBODY'S WIFE.

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:39.910
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:41.311
OH, SHUT UP, PLEASE.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:43.914
BUT I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT I CAN BE

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:45.315
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER
BEEN ANYTHING.

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:47.918
AND YOU--
YOU'RE NOT SO MUCH
BETTER THAN ME.

01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:50.320
YOUR DADDY'S BEEN DEAD
OVER A YEAR,

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.257
AND YOU STILL CAN'T
SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT.

01:04:53.257 --> 01:04:56.860
AND YOU ARE SO WORRIED
ABOUT TURNING OUT
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.462
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:04:58.462 --> 01:04:59.863
I AM EVERYBODY ELSE.

01:04:59.863 --> 01:05:01.865
AND TURNING OUT LIKE ME,

01:05:01.865 --> 01:05:04.268
NOW, WOULD THAT
BE SO TERRIBLE?

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:06.870
AND WHO GETS
THEIR HAIR CUT

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:08.939
BY ELVIS' BARBER
ANYWAY?

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:15.279
* IT'S NOT REALLY LOVE *

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:18.215
* IF IT
TEARS YOU APART... *

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:20.684
[TRAIN HORN BLOWS]

01:05:29.559 --> 01:05:31.228
I AM VERY SORRY.

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:36.233
I GUESS I'M JUST
FALLING APART
A LITTLE BIT.

01:05:36.233 --> 01:05:38.235
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW

01:05:38.235 --> 01:05:40.237
I THINK
YOU'RE VERY SPECIAL

01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:41.838
'CAUSE
YOU ALWAYS LIKE ME,

01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:45.109
AND THAT'S A PLUS
IN MY BOOK.

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:47.978
GOD, DID I MAKE YOU CRY?

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:51.515
I LIKE YOUR HAIR.

01:05:53.517 --> 01:05:54.451
THANKS.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:57.054
MAYBE I SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN MINE DONE.

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:58.655
YEAH.
SHOULD WE GO BACK?

01:05:58.655 --> 01:06:00.857
I DON'T THINK SO,
MIRANDA.

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:05.062
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
AND THINKING THAT, UM...

01:06:05.062 --> 01:06:07.064
MAYBE I'LL GO
TO HOLLYWOOD,

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:09.066
BECOME A MOVIE STAR.

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:12.669
YOU'RE ASKING ME
WHAT I THINK
OF THE IDEA?

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:14.071
NO, I'M NOT.

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:15.739
WHAT ABOUT BILLY?

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:19.743
BILLY CAN DO
WHAT HE WANTS.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.218
I'M HAPPY.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:31.221
I'M SO HAPPY.

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:39.496
ME, TOO.

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:42.566
OH, NO.

01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:43.567
DON'T LOOK.

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:44.568
OH, NO.

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:45.369
DON'T LOOK.

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:47.571
I GOT TO GO TO WORK.

01:06:47.571 --> 01:06:48.972
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

01:06:48.972 --> 01:06:49.973
YOU'RE SICK.

01:06:49.973 --> 01:06:51.375
I'LL CALL IN FOR YOU.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:52.942
"HELLO.
IT'S MIRANDA.

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:54.211
"I CAN'T COME IN.

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:55.345
"I'M SICK.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:59.283
I'VE GOT
A TERRIBLE HEAD COLD."

01:06:59.283 --> 01:07:00.084
O.K.

01:07:00.084 --> 01:07:01.351
I'M SICK.

01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:05.689
I GOT ANOTHER IDEA.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:07.091
MM-HMM?

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:13.797
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:16.800
JUST GIVE ME A HINT.

01:07:18.102 --> 01:07:19.369
CLUE.

01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:22.606
"MEMPHIS."

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:24.274
MEMPHIS?

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:27.444
GRACELAND?

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:28.245
YEAH!

01:07:28.245 --> 01:07:30.114
WE'RE GOING
TO GRACELAND!

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:35.985
CLOSED?

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:37.121
NO.

01:07:37.121 --> 01:07:39.723
I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:40.724
NO!

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:41.725
ELVIS!

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:42.726
HELLO?

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:43.727
ELVIS!

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:44.728
HELLO?

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:45.729
SIR...

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:46.730
WE'RE CLOSED.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:48.132
WHEN DO YOU OPEN?

01:07:48.132 --> 01:07:49.733
9:00 IN THE MORNING.

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:51.135
Y'ALL COME BACK THEN.

01:07:51.135 --> 01:07:52.469
AH, 14 HOURS TO KILL.

01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:54.671
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?

01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:55.472
EAT.

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:57.073
LET'S GET ELVIS FOOD.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:58.542
FOOD.

01:07:58.542 --> 01:07:59.743
[LAUGHS]

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.504
I'M ALL SET, BABY.

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:33.243
COME ON, BABY.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.252
WHAT?

01:08:43.019 --> 01:08:44.421
OHH,
LOOK HOW ROMANTIC.

01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:46.990
STOP. THEY'RE GOING TO
THINK YOU'RE FOR REAL.

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:48.258
I AM FOR REAL.

01:08:48.258 --> 01:08:49.792
COME ON.
GET UP.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:52.962
SAY, "YES,
I CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT YOU."

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:53.930
GO ON, HONEY.

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:55.399
SAY YES.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.801
I WOULD MARRY HIM
IF HE HAD
ANY BRAINS,

01:08:57.801 --> 01:09:01.004
BUT HE DOESN'T
HAVE THE SENSE
HE WAS BORN WITH.

01:09:01.004 --> 01:09:03.006
I'M GOING TO
KNEEL RIGHT HERE

01:09:03.006 --> 01:09:04.608
UNTIL YOUR HEART MELTS.

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:05.609
SAY SOMETHING.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:06.410
O.K. YES.

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.412
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:10.013
ARE YOU
HAPPY NOW?

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:11.381
HAPPY?

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:13.983
WHY, I'M THE HAPPIEST
MAN ALIVE.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.652
OHH.
AW.

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:17.987
THAT'S PRECIOUS.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.389
THANK YOU, LADIES.

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:20.890
THANK YOU KINDLY.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.492
YOU CAN KEEP THE CHANGE.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:24.794
Y'ALL GOING TO
HAVE YOUR HONEYMOON
AT GRACELAND?

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:25.995
COME ON, DEAR.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:31.901
* IN A BED
OF BROKEN HEARTS *

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:35.138
* BLUE ROSES... *

01:09:35.138 --> 01:09:37.741
YOU RECALL
THE FIRST TIME
I MET YOU

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:39.142
OUTSIDE THE BLUEBIRD?

01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:40.810
I WAS LATE.

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:44.881
AND I MADE YOU
PART OF MY LIE.

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:47.283
NOW, YOU CALLED ME
ON THAT.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:50.886
NO ONE HAS EVER
DONE THAT BEFORE
WITH ME.

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:52.288
AND I APPRECIATE IT.

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:53.957
I RESPECT YOU.

01:10:00.764 --> 01:10:01.831
MY FATHER...

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:05.168
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M TELLING YOU THIS.

01:10:05.168 --> 01:10:06.570
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE,

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:08.972
BUT MY FATHER
WOULD TELL MY MOTHER

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:12.976
THAT WE WERE GOING OUT
FOR A BOYS' NIGHT
OUT ON THE TOWN.

01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:15.579
AND WE WOULD GO
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE--

01:10:15.579 --> 01:10:17.581
MY FIFTH GRADE
HEALTH TEACHER--

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:20.584
AND I'D GO WAIT
IN THE TRUCK

01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:22.586
LISTENING TO
THE RADIO STATIONS,

01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:25.188
AND HE WAS INSIDE,
YOU KNOW,

01:10:25.188 --> 01:10:27.591
DOING WHATEVER IT WAS
THEY DID,

01:10:27.591 --> 01:10:30.860
AND I JUST REMEMBER
ALL THOSE CHEATIN' SONGS...

01:10:32.195 --> 01:10:34.464
HOW IT MADE
PERFECT SENSE.

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:40.203
MOST EVERYONE...

01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:41.871
BACK IN WIMBERLY...

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:48.745
SAYS THAT--
THAT I'M GOING TO BE
JUST LIKE MY FATHER.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.146
NOW...

01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:51.881
HERE'S THE KING.

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:53.983
THEY'RE WRONG.

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:58.688
* WISE MEN SAY *

01:10:58.688 --> 01:10:59.756
YOU HEAR THAT?

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:00.824
MMM.

01:11:00.824 --> 01:11:04.093
* ONLY FOOLS
RUSH IN *

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.161
LET'S DANCE.

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:06.563
IT'S DESTINY.

01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:13.537
* BUT I CAN'T HELP *

01:11:13.537 --> 01:11:17.273
* FALLING IN LOVE *

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:21.044
* WITH YOU *

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:27.951
* SHALL I STAY? *

01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:29.252
[THUNDER]

01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:35.392
* WOULD IT BE A SIN? *

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:45.001
JUST BACK
FOR SOME COFFEE.

01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:46.403
OH, LOOK, MARY.

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:47.804
IF IT AIN'T
THE NEWLYWEDS.

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:50.540
HEY, YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS
GET MARRIED YET?

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:53.276
COULDN'T FIND
AN ALL-NIGHT
WEDDING CHAPEL.

01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:56.613
WELL, WE MIGHT'VE
IF HE PLANNED THIS
A LITTLE BETTER,

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:58.615
BUT NO GRACELAND,
NO PREACHER.

01:11:58.615 --> 01:12:00.283
YOU WANT
TO MARRY HER?

01:12:00.283 --> 01:12:02.285
I KNOW SHE'S A HANDFUL,

01:12:02.285 --> 01:12:04.488
HOWEVER I'D DIE
IF I LOST HER.

01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:08.291
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'D FORGET TO BREATHE
IF I DIDN'T REMIND YOU.

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:10.427
THE TRUTH IS...

01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:12.095
I LOVE HER DEEPLY.

01:12:13.129 --> 01:12:14.531
WELL, IF YOU'RE SERIOUS,

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:15.932
MY BROTHER'S A PREACHER.

01:12:15.932 --> 01:12:18.535
I'LL GO GET HIM
IF YOU WANT.

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:19.536
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

01:12:19.536 --> 01:12:21.337
AS A HEART ATTACK.

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:23.573
YEAH, MAN.

01:12:23.573 --> 01:12:25.308
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT
NEXT DOOR.

01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:26.943
PROBABLY JUST WATCHING TV.

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:28.344
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:29.345
WELL, UH--

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.914
YOU NEED A RING.

01:12:30.914 --> 01:12:32.015
COLD FEET?

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:37.913
IN THE HAMPER.

01:23:37.913 --> 01:23:40.249
I HAVEN'T WORN IT
SINCE I WASHED IT.

01:23:40.249 --> 01:23:42.385
I GUESS
SOMEBODY ELSE
WORE IT, THEN.

01:23:42.385 --> 01:23:44.153
OUGHTN'T YOU
TO WASH IT, THEN?

01:23:44.153 --> 01:23:45.654
I'M NOT YOUR MAID.

01:23:45.654 --> 01:23:48.257
MIRANDA, YOU CAN
WEAR MY SHIRT
IF YOU LIKE.

01:23:48.257 --> 01:23:50.393
HOWEVER,
YOUR DIRT MAKES IT
YOUR LAUNDRY.

01:23:50.393 --> 01:23:52.128
JAMES,
IT'S NOT THAT DIRTY.

01:23:52.128 --> 01:23:53.362
YOU COULD WEAR IT.

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.498
I CAN'T. IT SMELLS
LIKE YOUR SOAP.

01:23:55.498 --> 01:23:58.367
I CAN'T STAND
EVERYTHING SMELLING
LIKE THAT SOAP!

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.969
MY SOAP IS
STARTING TO SMELL
LIKE YOUR SOAP!

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:03.106
THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL
WEAR THE SHIRT.

01:24:03.106 --> 01:24:04.907
YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE
TO LIVE WITH.

01:24:04.907 --> 01:24:06.275
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

01:24:06.275 --> 01:24:08.277
LOCK YOURSELF IN A ROOM
FOR THREE DAYS,

01:24:08.277 --> 01:24:10.779
THEN COME OUT AND SAY,
"WHERE'S MY BLUE SHIRT?"

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:13.982
AND WHEN ARE YOU
EVER AWAKE DURING
THE DAYLIGHT HOURS?

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.384
THAT IS NOT
THE POINT!

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:17.520
YOU GO INSIDE,
YOU LOCK THE DOOR,

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.522

ALLOWED IN.

A ROOM LIKE THAT?

GET A ROOM?

FOR A WHILE.

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:31.634

FOR A WEEK,

BUT I'LL GIVE IT
TO YOU NOW

01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:44.580
SO YOU DON'T
THINK I'M TRYING
TO SCAM YOU.

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.182
MAYBE I ALWAYS
MARRY GUYS

01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:50.186
SO I CAN LIVE IN
A HOUSE FOR FREE
AND BE IGNORED.

MADE A CHECK OUT

AND YOU'RE MARRIED
TO A DICKHEAD,

WHAT DOES THAT
MAKE YOU?

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:15.244
AN IDIOT.
