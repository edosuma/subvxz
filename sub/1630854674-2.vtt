00:01.479 --> 00:02.915
<i>Previously on "Will Trent"...</i>

00:02.915 --> 00:04.439
- It's not her. That's Kayla!
- Are you sure?

00:04.439 --> 00:07.050
- Abigail! It's not Emma!
- What?

00:07.050 --> 00:09.226
Put out an Amber Alert.
This is a kidnapping.

00:09.226 --> 00:11.359
Agent Trent, this is
Detective Faith Mitchell.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.969
No partners.
That was our agreement.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.188
You've never worked
an active kidnapping.

00:14.188 --> 00:16.364
Let's be clear--
neither of us is thrilled

00:16.364 --> 00:18.018
about this arrangement,
so let's just be polite

00:18.018 --> 00:19.149
and get through this case.

00:19.149 --> 00:21.760
Should Detective Polaski
stay in vice,

00:21.760 --> 00:23.066
with all her vices?

00:23.066 --> 00:24.502
Well, maybe a change of scene
would be good.

00:24.502 --> 00:25.982
I need someone
to keep an eye on you.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.462
No one's tougher than Ormewood.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.986
Ahh! I didn't mean
to kill anybody, man!

00:29.986 --> 00:31.988
<i>Listen to me.
Let's just bring Emma home.</i>

00:31.988 --> 00:34.599
I don't know where she is!

00:34.599 --> 00:35.557
Then tell me
who your partner is.

00:35.557 --> 00:36.993
I can't!

00:36.993 --> 00:38.777
I really messed up.
I need your help.

00:38.777 --> 00:39.996
- What happened?
- I shot him.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.911
- Who?
- The man that took Emma.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.569
Mr. Campano,
it's the middle of the night.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.049
You've been drinking.
I need you to leave.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.007
Where is she? Huh?

00:51.007 --> 00:52.139
I don't know what
you're talking about!

00:52.139 --> 00:53.749
Where is she?!
Don't tell me-- Don't--

00:53.749 --> 00:55.098
If you don't leave,
I'm gonna call the police.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.839
No, I know about you.
I know about you!

00:56.839 --> 00:58.145
- Where is my daughter?
- You are out of your mind!

00:58.145 --> 01:00.277
- I'm going in my house!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:00.277 --> 01:01.670
Don't you--

01:01.670 --> 01:04.020
Don't you walk away from me!

01:04.020 --> 01:06.109
Aah!

01:06.109 --> 01:07.893
What?

01:16.946 --> 01:18.165
What the hell did you do, huh?

01:18.165 --> 01:19.514
It was an accident.

01:19.514 --> 01:21.472
You need to tell me what
happened. Betty, shut up.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.387
God, you smell like you
climbed out of a bottle of gin.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.389
Yeah, you jealous?
You used to hit it pretty
hard back in the day.

01:25.389 --> 01:26.608
All right. Take it easy, Paul.

01:26.608 --> 01:27.870
I do have a badge and a gun
these days.

01:27.870 --> 01:29.089
Both of you shut up.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.873
Betty, I'm not gonna
say it again. I mean it.

01:31.961 --> 01:33.397
Hey, what happened?

01:33.397 --> 01:35.051
- Where are my pants?
- Living room.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.879
- I was--
- Tell me.

01:36.879 --> 01:37.967
Evan Bernard.

01:37.967 --> 01:40.056
Emma's English teacher.

01:40.056 --> 01:42.928
Emma and this... pervert

01:42.928 --> 01:44.539
were working
on a project together.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.976
A lot of office hours
behind closed doors.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.543
And then, out of the blue,

01:48.543 --> 01:50.762
she just wanted to transfer
to another class.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.938
And you think something
happened between them.

01:52.938 --> 01:55.071
No. No. I don't think,
I know, okay? I know!

01:55.071 --> 01:56.768
I mean, she shut down.

01:56.768 --> 01:58.727
She stopped caring
about anything,

01:58.727 --> 02:01.469
and I was just too busy opening
up new locations to notice.

02:01.469 --> 02:04.167
But I-- I just went there
to-- to talk with him.

02:04.167 --> 02:05.299
I didn't-- I didn't mean
to hurt him, Trash.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.561
That's hard to sell

02:06.561 --> 02:08.084
considering you took the gun
over there.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.216
Don't call him Trash,
by the way.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.521
Just listen to me!

02:10.521 --> 02:12.784
You two of all people
should understand.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.569
Where we came from?

02:14.569 --> 02:16.658
I think we all know
how to spot a predator.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.358
Is that your blood or his?

02:21.358 --> 02:23.534
It's his.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.101
- You got a bag in there?
- Kitchen.

02:25.101 --> 02:27.495
Middle drawer next to the sink.

02:27.495 --> 02:28.583
Take off your shirt.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.152
- Ang, you got handcuffs?
- Always!

02:33.588 --> 02:34.937
Give me the shirt.

02:34.937 --> 02:36.373
We need his DNA.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.332
Now we're gonna
have to arrest you

02:38.332 --> 02:40.203
because you shot a man
in his driveway.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.553
And if you're right,
then everything else we do

02:42.553 --> 02:45.034
needs to be by the book--
if he's still alive.

02:45.034 --> 02:47.428
I can't believe you guys
are still hooking up.

02:47.428 --> 02:48.603
You know, there's
a whole world out there

02:48.603 --> 02:49.952
full of people, right?

02:49.952 --> 02:51.432
Thank you for the life advice.

02:51.432 --> 02:52.955
You have the right
to remain silent.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.130
Anything you say can and will be

02:54.130 --> 02:56.176
used against you
in a court of law.

03:04.140 --> 03:06.142
Ambulance is on the way.

03:06.142 --> 03:08.013
He's still breathing.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.146
His pulse is weak and thready.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.669
Two pools of blood. He moved.

03:11.669 --> 03:14.194
You've got a minute
before we get company.

03:14.803 --> 03:17.806
Emma! Emma!

03:17.806 --> 03:21.636
Hey! Ask that pervert
what he did with my daughter!

03:21.636 --> 03:23.203
Yeah, I'd love to,
but you shot him,

03:23.203 --> 03:24.508
so he's not taking questions
right now. Can you shut up?

03:24.508 --> 03:26.641
Kick him in the nuts!
See if he wakes up.

03:26.641 --> 03:30.166
Would you shut up, Paul?!
Is she here, you think?

03:30.166 --> 03:32.168
No. Curtains are open.
Neighbors are close.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.214
No basement.

03:53.711 --> 03:57.062
He got up with
a gunshot wound to the abdomen

03:57.062 --> 03:59.674
to lock the door then
came back here and passed out.

03:59.674 --> 04:00.979
Why?

04:00.979 --> 04:03.199
So Will Trent
can't get in his house.

04:06.202 --> 04:10.424
There's something in there
he didn't want us to see.

04:12.469 --> 04:15.124
How much detail
am I supposed to put in this?

04:15.124 --> 04:17.300
As much detail
as you can possibly remember,

04:17.300 --> 04:19.215
starting from the moment
you thought it was a good idea

04:19.215 --> 04:20.477
to take a gun to his house.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.219
What are you doing
to find my daughter?

04:23.219 --> 04:24.438
Will is at the hospital.

04:24.438 --> 04:27.223
He'll talk to Evan
as soon as he wakes up.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.572
How are you feeling?
Are you still drunk?

04:28.572 --> 04:31.227
I wish.

04:31.227 --> 04:33.229
You keep in touch with anyone?
Mrs. Flanagan?

04:33.229 --> 04:36.232
Uh, she passed away
10 years ago already.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.755
May she rest in peace.

04:38.669 --> 04:40.628
I still keep my hankie. You?

04:40.628 --> 04:41.629
Sure, I'm a lady.

04:43.152 --> 04:44.284
You and Will, though.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.156
Me and Will.

04:47.156 --> 04:50.246
You guys always had each other.
Must've been nice.

04:50.246 --> 04:51.639
Well, I guess you still do.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.989
Honestly, I don't know
if that's romantic or sad.

04:55.164 --> 04:57.035
Yeah, it's a little of both.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.733
You think about that time much,
when we were kids?

04:58.733 --> 05:00.256
You do any therapy?

05:00.256 --> 05:02.954
Oh, thinking about the past
always gets me in trouble.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.261
In general, I like
to keep it moving forward.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.262
Hundred percent.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.613
You and I were
never so different.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.311
Yeah, except you seem
like kind of a douche

05:11.311 --> 05:13.443
and, uh, you're going to jail.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.271
True.

05:15.271 --> 05:18.100
I also drive a much better car
than you because I'm rich,

05:18.100 --> 05:19.884
which means I'll be out
in two hours.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.277
Yeah, well, you got me there.

05:21.277 --> 05:22.800
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.281
Evan was on the phone
when he opened the door?

05:25.281 --> 05:26.500
Mm-hmm.

05:32.288 --> 05:33.898
Ahh.

05:33.898 --> 05:36.510
WOMAN â™ª2: She think
we don't know where she was.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.381
What is everyone staring at?

05:38.381 --> 05:40.035
Oh, well,
everyone's very interested

05:40.035 --> 05:42.254
in the fact that you were at
Will Trent's house at 4:00 a.m.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.735
when Paul Campano showed up with
a bloody shirt, including me.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.302
I'm your sponsor.
I got a lot of questions.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.303
Oh.

05:49.566 --> 05:52.308
Everybody knows?
Does Heller know?

05:52.308 --> 05:54.528
Oh, honey.
Even the cleaning lady knows.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.313
How long has this
been going on for?

05:57.313 --> 05:58.793
25 years.

05:58.793 --> 05:59.794
Excuse me?

06:03.580 --> 06:06.017
You know how I said
I grew up in a group home?

06:06.017 --> 06:08.846
Well, Will was there.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.632
So he and I are--
He's like my arm,

06:11.632 --> 06:12.763
if I was in a lifelong,

06:12.763 --> 06:14.939
on-and-off relationship
with my arm.

06:14.939 --> 06:17.594
Mm-hmm. We call that
co-dependent in the program.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.335
Is being in a relationship
with someone

06:19.335 --> 06:21.424
that reminds you of
the worst time in your life

06:21.424 --> 06:22.991
- good for your sobriety?
- No, no, no, no!

06:22.991 --> 06:24.471
It's fine,
because what we do is,

06:24.471 --> 06:25.863
we don't talk about
anything that matters.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.343
Oh.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.214
Um, okay, so,
speaking of sobriety,

06:29.214 --> 06:30.781
yesterday,
when I was undercover,

06:30.781 --> 06:33.001
I had to wear a fentanyl patch
for a half-hour.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.046
But it-- I took it off.
It's fine. No big deal.

06:35.046 --> 06:36.352
Sounds like
a very big deal to me.

06:36.352 --> 06:39.224
Look. Get a meeting today, okay?

06:39.224 --> 06:40.400
Yes, yes, totally.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.358
Hey! I got something for you.

06:42.358 --> 06:43.707
What you got?

06:43.707 --> 06:45.622
So, Paul said that
when Evan answered the door,

06:45.622 --> 06:47.972
he was on a phone,
a "cheap" black phone.

06:47.972 --> 06:50.366
A burner.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.676
That's why he went back in.

07:00.332 --> 07:02.378
- So, did you talk to him?
<i>- Not awake.</i>

07:02.378 --> 07:05.990
I'll get him to tell me
who he is, if he ever wakes up.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.384
Hey, um...

07:08.384 --> 07:09.820
glad you came by last night.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.648
<i>It was fun.</i>

07:11.648 --> 07:13.084
Before Paul crashed the party.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.608
Uh, yeah.

07:14.608 --> 07:17.393
Everyone at APD knows
I was at your house last night,

07:17.393 --> 07:19.787
so that is awesome for me.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.441
Well, my stock just went way up.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.094
Yeah, well,
mine just went way down.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.401
Why?
Everyone at APD loves me.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.406
Screw it.
Cat's out the bag.

07:30.406 --> 07:33.104
Let's go out to dinner.
Like a date.

07:33.104 --> 07:34.758
We don't date.

07:34.758 --> 07:37.544
We scurry around in the shadows
and wallow in shame.

07:37.544 --> 07:38.893
I'm just saying,
let's try something new.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.636
<i>Come on. Let's go to dinner.</i>

07:42.636 --> 07:44.594
We can still wallow
in shame after.

07:44.594 --> 07:47.902
All right. You're on.

07:47.902 --> 07:50.382
Find the girl so you can
take me out for a steak.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.168
On it.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.430
- All right.
- Let's go, partner.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.519
We caught a body in Grove Park.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.434
Hey, does Trent keep the vest on
during sex?

08:00.697 --> 08:01.872
Yeah.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.662
What the hell
are you doing here?

08:08.662 --> 08:10.533
Will's at the hospital waiting
to interview Evan Bernard.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.361
Who?

08:12.361 --> 08:14.755
Paul Campano shot one of
Emma's teacher's last night.

08:14.755 --> 08:17.453
He thinks he had
his daughter kidnapped.

08:17.453 --> 08:19.499
I should not have to
recap your case to you.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.457
- Well, I didn't know.
- Well, why didn't you know?

08:21.457 --> 08:24.460
Am I gonna regret
putting you on this case?

08:24.460 --> 08:26.027
No, ma'am.

08:30.074 --> 08:32.642
Agent Trent? He's awake.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.339
Did you find a cellphone on him
when he arrived?

08:34.339 --> 08:37.125
Not that I know of.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.822
I'm gonna send someone
to look through the trash.

08:38.822 --> 08:39.997
Will you make sure
it doesn't get collected?

08:42.565 --> 08:45.263
<i>Dr. Caplan, extension 2366.</i>

08:45.263 --> 08:46.787
Evan Bernard?

08:46.787 --> 08:49.572
Special Agent Will Trent,
Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

08:49.572 --> 08:50.878
You want to tell me
what happened?

08:50.878 --> 08:53.489
Sure. Uh, Paul Campano
came to my house.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.491
He was drunk and enraged

08:55.491 --> 08:57.493
and accused me
of kidnapping his daughter.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.626
I asked him to leave,
and he proceeded to shoot me.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.411
Mr. Campano says you were
on the phone when he arrived.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.545
No. Uh, he woke me
from a dead sleep.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.677
Did you happen to go back
into the house after he left?

09:07.677 --> 09:10.506
After he shot me?
No. I was unconscious.

09:10.506 --> 09:14.510
I saw you started your career
at the university level.

09:14.510 --> 09:15.946
Why the switch to high school?

09:17.469 --> 09:19.559
I like to be the one
to open young minds.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.953
Hmm. You do some tutoring, too.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.520
Gotta make ends meet.

09:24.520 --> 09:25.521
You having financial problems?

09:25.521 --> 09:26.740
Oh, who doesn't?

09:26.740 --> 09:28.568
Well, the Campanos
are doing pretty well.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.527
Do you ever tutor any students

09:31.527 --> 09:33.616
with learning disabilities, dyslexia?

09:33.616 --> 09:35.618
Yes, I-I tutor some students
with dyslexia.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.968
You ever tutor a young man
by the name of Warren Grier?

09:38.839 --> 09:40.101
Never heard of him.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.929
You sure? Take a second.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.192
Slight build? Curly blond hair?

09:44.192 --> 09:45.802
Committed suicide last night?

09:46.716 --> 09:49.371
I'm positive.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.590
Are we through here?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.069
Not quite.
Did you know Kayla Alexander?

09:53.505 --> 09:54.637
I don't know her personally,

09:54.637 --> 09:56.552
but I understand
she's quite a handful.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.728
Not anymore, right? She's dead.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.211
What about Emma?
You were her teacher, right?

10:03.211 --> 10:04.952
Then she transferred
out of your class. Why?

10:04.952 --> 10:07.041
She took
a less-challenging course.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.564
Not everyone's ready
for "Beowulf."

10:08.564 --> 10:10.218
Did you ever make
a sexual advance on her?

10:13.613 --> 10:14.831
Okay.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.443
I gotta piss like a racehorse.
Help me to the bathroom?

10:18.443 --> 10:20.097
- Let me get some help.
- Uh, just...

10:21.577 --> 10:23.579
Why don't you just
get the door for me?

10:23.579 --> 10:24.624
All right.

10:28.671 --> 10:29.890
Sign says "pull."

10:29.890 --> 10:32.457
Yeah. I got it.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.416
I noticed you don't take notes,
Agent Trent.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.461
I have a good memory.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.594
Plus, I'm a pretty
observant guy.

10:43.077 --> 10:46.646
I have never done anything
inappropriate with a student.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.864
Ever.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.260
Any chance we could take a look
around your place?

10:56.656 --> 10:58.353
I want to talk to my lawyer.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.792
Oh, by all means.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.838
I'll be in touch.

11:07.362 --> 11:10.452
Evan Bernard presents
as arrogant and intelligent.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.149
He stated a preference
for softer targets

11:12.149 --> 11:14.108
by switching from university
to high-school teaching--

11:14.108 --> 11:15.718
I need you to keep me
in the loop.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.633
He wanted to end the interview
when Warren's name came up,

11:17.633 --> 11:20.636
and he denigrated both Kayla
Alexander and Emma Campano.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.246
The bathroom thing
was a power move.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.465
He also doesn't miss a thing.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.553
He's our guy. It's him.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.207
Oh, I'm sorry.
I need to take this.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.472
When?

11:30.472 --> 11:31.821
Okay. We'll be right there.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.562
I don't see
how it could be your guy.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.433
Abigail Campano
just got a ransom call

11:35.433 --> 11:36.478
five minutes ago.

11:36.478 --> 11:37.653
They want $3 million.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.402
Mommy, please.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.752
<i>Just pay them
whatever they want.</i>

11:51.536 --> 11:53.887
<i>I just want to come home.</i>

11:53.887 --> 11:55.540
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

11:57.151 --> 11:58.587
Stop the video.

11:58.587 --> 12:01.982
Mrs. Campano, I need you
to focus on the background.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.418
Do you recognize anything?

12:03.418 --> 12:05.681
The wood paneling,
the-- the blanket, the pillow?

12:05.681 --> 12:06.682
Does anything look familiar?

12:06.682 --> 12:08.684
I don't recognize any of it.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.599
My father has the money in cash.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.383
That's a bad idea.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.515
We strongly recommend against

12:13.515 --> 12:14.690
paying the ransom
in every case.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.561
No! That's how we get Emma back!

12:16.561 --> 12:17.954
If they get the money,

12:17.954 --> 12:19.260
there's nothing stopping them
from killing her.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.566
Do you have a better idea?

12:22.567 --> 12:24.395
Evan Bernard knows
more than he's saying.

12:24.395 --> 12:27.398
Oh, you mean the reputable
teacher that my husband shot?

12:27.398 --> 12:30.097
I think he was in the hospital
when the call came in.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.707
He must be working
with an accomplice.

12:31.707 --> 12:32.752
Do you have evidence of that?

12:35.798 --> 12:38.105
Not yet. Just give me six hours.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.933
Let me go to the school
and talk to some people.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.849
We can stall the ransom
until then.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.764
Mrs. Campano.

12:46.853 --> 12:47.767
Please.

12:52.641 --> 12:53.773
I'll give you six hours.

12:56.819 --> 12:57.951
You better be right about this.

13:02.912 --> 13:05.785
The hospital found this
in a pillow case. No prints.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.311
You're going to the school
without me, aren't you?

13:10.311 --> 13:11.878
Yes.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.794
You're welcome to come.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.752
I'm "welcome to come"?

13:16.752 --> 13:18.754
How wonderful.

13:18.754 --> 13:19.799
Actually, you can drive.

13:27.241 --> 13:30.766
Why Will Trent, of all people?

13:30.766 --> 13:32.768
What floor is our body on?

13:32.768 --> 13:34.248
Eighth.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.685
Come on. Tell me.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.513
His clearance rate
puts yours to shame.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.863
Is that a euphemism?

13:40.863 --> 13:42.996
Yeah. Maybe it is.
We gotta stop.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.693
I'm having a cardiac event.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.216
Well, it's not like
she can get more dead.

13:48.218 --> 13:49.785
He's good police.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.743
Okay?
Competence, that's sexy.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.441
And he's objectively hot.

13:53.441 --> 13:56.531
And you know what else?
He listens, Ormewood.

13:56.531 --> 13:57.793
Underrated quality in a man.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.884
I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

14:01.884 --> 14:04.800
My mind just kind of
wandered off there.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.236
I guess I'm just a simple man.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.629
Funny.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.805
I'm kidding.

14:09.805 --> 14:12.199
Okay.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.853
Only five more flights.

14:16.681 --> 14:17.813
Body's in there.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.859
- Landlord's waiting inside.
- Okay.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.904
Okay.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.866
There she is.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.520
She had a lot of visitors,
if you get my drift.

14:31.261 --> 14:33.089
Uh, blunt-force trauma
to the head.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.222
How long has that elevator
been out?

14:35.222 --> 14:37.398
You investigating the building
or the murder?

14:37.398 --> 14:39.835
The murder, for now.
Watch the tone.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.445
Were you the one who found her?

14:41.445 --> 14:43.752
Yeah.
She was late for her rent,

14:43.752 --> 14:46.102
so I came up,
the door was wide open.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.843
Uh-huh.

14:49.671 --> 14:51.847
Hey, Polaski, come here!

14:51.847 --> 14:53.457
Yeah. What you got?

14:59.855 --> 15:02.771
Ooh. What could this mean?

15:02.771 --> 15:05.861
I mean, I'm no Will Trent, but
let me read this crime scene.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.645
Thinking maybe somebody else
might've been here

15:07.645 --> 15:10.866
at the time of the murder,
dyeing their hair... blue?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.827
Let's see where this trail
takes us.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.188
Should we knock?

15:28.188 --> 15:30.755
What would Will Trent do?

15:30.755 --> 15:31.887
You want to give him a call
and ask?

15:31.887 --> 15:32.975
All right.
I'm tired of this bit.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.672
APD! Open up!

15:36.196 --> 15:37.545
Open this door,
or I'll kick it in!

15:37.545 --> 15:39.939
Will you calm down?
You can't act like this anymore.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.421
I didn't kill her, I swear.
I know this looks bad.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.382
Hey, wait up!

15:48.382 --> 15:49.557
We need to talk.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.908
Hey. Listen.

15:52.908 --> 15:55.563
Do you think a dog can
get their feelings hurt?

15:55.563 --> 15:56.912
I haven't given it much thought,

15:56.912 --> 15:59.001
but I suppose it's a good idea

15:59.001 --> 16:02.874
to treat all of God's creatures
with kindness and respect.

16:02.874 --> 16:04.920
To that end, the next time
that you get a lead on our case

16:04.920 --> 16:07.096
in the middle of the night,
call me.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.142
I don't care if Angie Polaski
is in your bed.

16:09.142 --> 16:12.928
Wow.
Everyone knows, huh? Amanda?

16:12.928 --> 16:14.974
Amanda probably knew
before it happened.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.540
I heard what you were saying
about Evan

16:16.540 --> 16:18.107
in your little
tape-recorder diary thing.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.588
- Those are my notes.
- Whatever. Talk me through it.

16:20.588 --> 16:21.893
Warren Grier
was working with someone

16:21.893 --> 16:23.156
who had a hold on him,

16:23.156 --> 16:24.940
someone with so much
influence and control

16:24.940 --> 16:27.421
that he convinced Warren
to kill himself.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.510
Evan Bernard fits that profile
to a "T."

16:29.510 --> 16:30.946
He gets off on power.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.948
Yeah, but what about the ransom?

16:32.948 --> 16:34.602
You think this is
financially motivated?

16:34.602 --> 16:36.996
Sure. Money is power.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.954
Paul swears
he made a move on Emma.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.782
She rejected him
by switching teachers,

16:40.782 --> 16:42.436
so punishment for rejecting him

16:42.436 --> 16:43.698
with the bonus
of financial gain.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.353
Works for me.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.833
We just need
a second accomplice.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.184
Yeah.
Feels like a student.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.881
Agree.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.970
You see how easy that was?

16:54.970 --> 16:56.667
Keep your partner looped in.
It's fun.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.196
Consider yourself
especially "looped in"

17:03.196 --> 17:04.284
for this next part.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.245
I'm just gonna miss her so much!

17:10.594 --> 17:12.031
You were close with Kayla?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.989
Oh, God, no.
No, Kayla was awful.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.991
Emma was so sweet, though.

17:15.991 --> 17:17.079
We want to ask you
about Evan Bernard.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.298
Did he do something?

17:20.169 --> 17:22.215
He just wrote me a letter
of recommendation to Stanford.

17:22.215 --> 17:23.477
Is this going to affect that?

17:23.477 --> 17:25.783
Feels like we're focusing
on the wrong thing.

17:25.783 --> 17:27.916
I heard he was shot last night.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.745
Oh, my God! What is happening?!

17:30.745 --> 17:33.226
Is this a serial killer?
Is he hunting a certain type?

17:33.226 --> 17:36.011
Just want to steer
the conversation back to Evan--

17:36.011 --> 17:37.360
Emma and Kayla both had
long, blond hair.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.492
Do I need to cut my hair?

17:38.492 --> 17:39.754
- We have no reason to think--
- Yes.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.844
Can we get back to Mr. Bernard?

17:42.844 --> 17:44.019
Which of the students
were close to him?

17:46.978 --> 17:49.068
Well... there are
the Kayla rumors.

17:50.504 --> 17:51.635
What Kayla rumors?

17:58.686 --> 18:01.906
Kayla and Evan
sleeping together! Oh, my God.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.865
What is going on here?

18:03.865 --> 18:05.954
Special Agent Will Trent, GBI.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.130
We're looking into
the kidnapping of Emma Campano.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.698
I would appreciate it
if you went through my office.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.091
Girls, get to class.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.442
You two, come with me.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.706
You said Kayla had consensual
sex yesterday morning.

18:18.706 --> 18:19.750
- Gotta be Evan.
- Mm-hmm.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.231
Get the DNA back
on Paul's shirt.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.102
On it.

18:24.494 --> 18:27.628
You guys want water
or anything?

18:27.628 --> 18:31.197
I have tap or cold tap.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.982
No. Nico, we want you
to tell us what happened.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.723
All right,
let's take Nico here

18:35.723 --> 18:37.333
down to the police station.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.639
She's either the witness
or the do-er.

18:38.639 --> 18:39.727
They/them!

18:39.727 --> 18:41.946
Okay, I wanted to dye my hair

18:41.946 --> 18:44.949
because it looked like ass,
but my shower is broken.

18:44.949 --> 18:47.691
Almost everybody's shower
is broken.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.171
Sasha said I could use hers.

18:49.171 --> 18:52.174
And when I got out
of the shower,

18:52.174 --> 18:56.439
all I heard was screaming
and yelling and then fighting

18:56.439 --> 18:59.225
and then a terrible sound...

18:59.225 --> 19:00.965
and then nothing.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.100
Sasha was dead.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.102
And I thought...

19:07.102 --> 19:09.104
That it looked bad for you.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.932
It does look bad for you.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.500
Found a blue handprint
on the window.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.936
Seems like you might
have seen something.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.115
No. Okay, well, did you
recognize the voice?

19:20.115 --> 19:21.812
- No!
- "No"?

19:21.812 --> 19:24.337
Well, that's a lie. And I've had
about enough of you.

19:24.337 --> 19:25.381
So let's go!

19:25.381 --> 19:28.123
Yo, calm down!

19:28.123 --> 19:31.039
Can I get some ranch dressing
and some extra napkins, please?

19:31.039 --> 19:32.301
- Sure.
- This is me.

19:33.346 --> 19:35.130
Hey, how old
do you think Nico is?

19:35.130 --> 19:36.914
Not a day over 16.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.133
Maybe we should
call her parents.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.570
No! Don't call my parents!
Please.

19:40.570 --> 19:41.789
Don't make me go back there.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.184
- Excuse me.
- There you go.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.536
Hey, you left the door open!

19:49.536 --> 19:51.364
She's eating your fries!

19:51.364 --> 19:53.148
They/them. It's not that hard.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.845
Well, you can cancel me
from jail.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.064
Hey, you.

19:56.064 --> 19:59.154
Hey, um, any chance you could

19:59.154 --> 20:00.721
drop by my house
and check on Betty?

20:00.721 --> 20:02.592
When did we get married?

20:02.592 --> 20:04.681
I feel terrible I yelled at her.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.077
Yeah, I could do that.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.644
Thank you.
Um, can you also just

20:10.644 --> 20:12.254
put a little bit of water
in her food?

20:12.254 --> 20:14.169
I think her teeth
are bothering her.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.171
<i>And, you know, maybe put
a little bit of music on.</i>

20:16.171 --> 20:19.218
Um, something upbeat, like
OutKast. That'd be fun, right?

20:19.218 --> 20:21.132
No, no, that might
overstimulate her.

20:21.132 --> 20:22.873
Let's--
Maybe more like Sam Cooke?

20:22.873 --> 20:25.615
Oh, my God. Who are you?
Just-- I gotta go.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.878
Okay. Thank you. Bye. Hi.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.185
Hi. I'm Mary Clark,
the guidance counselor.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.231
I can take you two
to Evan Bernard's office.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.625
Okay, great. How long has
Evan Bernard worked here?

20:35.625 --> 20:37.366
Uh, four or five years.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.629
There's a rumor that he
and Kayla were having sex.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.590
I never heard or saw
anything like that.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.418
We take that
very seriously here.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.420
We'll have to open
an investigation.

20:48.812 --> 20:52.120
I know all the girls here
pretty well.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.210
If you have any questions,
please reach out.

20:55.210 --> 20:58.213
We all want nothing more
than to find Emma.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.261
The DNA from the shirt

21:02.261 --> 21:04.001
won't be back
for another 48 hours.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.047
No, we have three hours
until Abigail pays the ransom.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.875
I need it now! Call the lab.

21:08.963 --> 21:11.313
Okay. I'll just go...

21:11.313 --> 21:13.272
yell at science.

21:17.058 --> 21:20.235
The area is clean and orderly.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.850
Who were you talking to

21:26.850 --> 21:28.896
when Paul knocked on the door,
Evan, huh?

21:31.202 --> 21:33.901
Grooming supplies
in the top drawer.

21:33.901 --> 21:35.598
Everything in here says creep.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.210
Can I help you find something?

21:39.210 --> 21:41.387
I'm finding everything I need.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.127
Nice tape recorder.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.477
Is that how you take notes?

21:44.477 --> 21:46.261
Mind if I record
this conversation?

21:46.261 --> 21:47.697
Sure.

21:47.697 --> 21:49.656
A lot of my students
use recording devices to cope.

21:51.135 --> 21:52.267
You know what?
I'm glad you're here, Evan.

21:52.267 --> 21:54.138
Saves me a trip.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.271
We pulled your DNA off
of Paul Campano's shirt,

21:56.271 --> 21:58.273
and it's an exact match

21:58.273 --> 21:59.840
for the semen found
on Kayla Alexander.

22:02.016 --> 22:05.062
We are in Georgia.
Age of consent is 17.

22:06.107 --> 22:08.283
You're not gonna even bother to
at least look a little ashamed?

22:08.283 --> 22:09.937
She was of age
and she wasn't coerced,

22:09.937 --> 22:10.938
so I haven't broken any laws.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.289
Well, except you have.

22:14.289 --> 22:17.248
You're a member of the faculty
at this school.

22:17.248 --> 22:19.294
That makes you her guardian.

22:19.294 --> 22:20.339
In loco parentis.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.299
You're under arrest.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.955
I'll be out on bail in 24 hours.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.522
Yeah, maybe by that time,
we'll find some other stuff

22:29.522 --> 22:32.220
to charge you with after we take
a look around your house.

22:32.220 --> 22:33.526
The lab says that
the DNA from the shirt's

22:33.526 --> 22:36.355
not coming back
until tomorrow morning...

22:36.355 --> 22:37.399
earliest.

22:39.619 --> 22:40.794
Played a hunch.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.714
He's working with an
accomplice. They could be armed.

22:47.714 --> 22:50.238
Go, go, go!

22:51.805 --> 22:53.589
Clear!

22:53.589 --> 22:56.505
- AGENT â™ª1: Clear!
- AGENT â™ª2: Clear!

22:56.505 --> 22:57.680
All clear!

23:01.989 --> 23:05.122
Whew! Bleach.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.385
You could do surgery in here.

23:07.473 --> 23:09.866
Guys? You gotta see this.

23:19.963 --> 23:23.358
Okay, but why clean the whole
house and keep this here?

23:23.358 --> 23:24.403
He's showing off.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.882
Yeah, but why?

23:25.882 --> 23:28.319
He's having fun with us.
Son of a bitch.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.892
- Yeah.
- Hey!

23:35.892 --> 23:38.199
Look at you!

23:38.199 --> 23:39.766
Weird little purse dog, huh?

23:39.766 --> 23:42.246
Hello! Hi!

23:42.246 --> 23:44.771
She's so cute!

23:44.771 --> 23:47.382
Whose house is this? It's nice.

23:47.382 --> 23:49.079
It's my friend Will's house.

23:49.079 --> 23:52.039
You know, when he was your age,
he had a rough go of things...

23:52.039 --> 23:54.389
but turned it around,

23:54.389 --> 23:56.217
made a nice life for himself.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.045
Anything's possible, huh?

23:59.438 --> 24:02.528
Nico, in my line of work,
you tell yourself stories

24:02.528 --> 24:04.443
when you're trying
to figure things out.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.227
And since
you haven't been talking,

24:06.227 --> 24:07.620
I've been making one up.

24:07.620 --> 24:11.493
It has to do with that
awful landlord of yours...

24:11.493 --> 24:15.323
and Sasha having
the only working shower.

24:15.323 --> 24:18.413
I'm thinking...
maybe she was trading sex

24:18.413 --> 24:20.110
for favors from him.

24:21.285 --> 24:23.374
No judgment.
Everybody's gotta survive.

24:23.374 --> 24:25.681
But maybe she wanted to stop.

24:28.075 --> 24:29.424
And guys like that can be scary

24:29.424 --> 24:31.339
when they don't get
what they want.

24:33.254 --> 24:35.952
She was my friend.

24:42.829 --> 24:46.136
Then let's do
this one last thing for her.

24:50.837 --> 24:52.099
It was the landlord.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.362
I saw him in the alley.

24:54.362 --> 24:56.059
He threw something
in the dumpster.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.019
He threw something
in the dumpster?

24:59.019 --> 25:00.455
Yeah.

25:00.455 --> 25:02.283
It-- It looked like a hammer.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.373
Great.

25:05.373 --> 25:09.682
That's really good. Okay.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.553
Let's go get this guy, Nico.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.775
Yes, sir, that is correct.
Demetrius is on the way up.

25:15.775 --> 25:18.473
Well, I gotta get the number
of your cleaning lady.

25:18.473 --> 25:19.518
Your place is immaculate.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.173
Especially that pedophile suite.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.392
Is that where you brought Emma?

25:26.525 --> 25:29.092
<i>What, you think you're special?</i>

25:29.092 --> 25:32.879
<i>You're just a garden-variety
abuser with a good education.</i>

25:32.879 --> 25:35.577
Do Paul and Abigail Campano know
that the lead investigator

25:35.577 --> 25:38.145
on their daughter's
active kidnapping case

25:38.145 --> 25:39.886
is functionally illiterate?

25:42.105 --> 25:44.543
I'm a pretty observant guy, too.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.763
You used the word "shame"
earlier.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.417
Is that a big theme
in your life?

25:49.417 --> 25:50.636
How old were you, huh,

25:50.636 --> 25:52.594
when you realized
you weren't... keeping up?

25:52.594 --> 25:54.596
- Where is Emma, Evan?
- Is your whole life

25:54.596 --> 25:56.424
organized around
keeping your secret?

25:56.424 --> 25:57.947
- Where is she?
- You really think

25:57.947 --> 26:00.776
that that costume you wear
keeps people from seeing you?

26:00.776 --> 26:03.518
I figured it out in two moves.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.172
Not everybody
is as perceptive as me,

26:05.172 --> 26:07.087
but I bet most people
get a whiff

26:07.087 --> 26:09.568
that something is just... off.

26:11.787 --> 26:14.660
I'm gonna find Emma.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.444
And I'm gonna put you away.

26:16.444 --> 26:17.532
Know that.

26:28.978 --> 26:29.979
Who saw that?

26:29.979 --> 26:31.415
What the hell happened in there?

26:31.415 --> 26:33.417
I got made, is what happened!
Who else saw that?!

26:33.417 --> 26:35.942
Just me. So that's it?

26:35.942 --> 26:37.204
You let this guy
get under your skin,

26:37.204 --> 26:39.467
and we just sit there,
chicken in hand?

26:39.467 --> 26:41.556
Your six hours is up.
Abigail wants to pay.

26:41.556 --> 26:43.819
- That's a terrible idea!
- I know!

26:43.819 --> 26:45.168
So what's your next play?

26:46.779 --> 26:48.955
You've operated this way
your entire career,

26:48.955 --> 26:50.478
and you're the best I have.

26:50.478 --> 26:51.827
Maybe it's time
to get over yourself

26:51.827 --> 26:52.741
and ask for some help.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.267
No?

27:00.575 --> 27:02.142
Caroline, get Faith in here.

27:02.142 --> 27:03.491
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

27:03.491 --> 27:05.580
Use Faith. She's smart.

27:05.580 --> 27:06.842
And she can read.

27:07.713 --> 27:10.672
Oh, that's low, even for you.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.631
What's up?

27:18.419 --> 27:20.421
Go through everything we found
at the recording studio.

27:20.421 --> 27:21.683
We must have missed something.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.337
See if you can find
anything that connects

27:23.337 --> 27:24.599
Warren Grier to Evan Bernard.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.427
Yeah, the uniforms
are already doing that.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.037
I don't know those uniforms!

27:28.037 --> 27:30.474
I know you,
and I'm asking you to do it!

27:30.474 --> 27:31.650
Well, where are you going?

27:33.826 --> 27:35.654
To tell the Campanos
to pay the ransom.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.229
If I get Hep "C" from a needle,
I'm suing the department.

27:46.229 --> 27:47.709
You probably already have
Hep "C."

27:50.669 --> 27:52.627
Hey, listen, I wanted
to tell you that I--

27:52.627 --> 27:54.498
I'm just gonna
stop you right there.

27:54.498 --> 27:55.891
What, we can't talk about it?

27:55.891 --> 27:58.720
Why does everybody
have to talk about everything?

27:58.720 --> 28:00.635
- Because I feel bad.
- It was one gross night.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.985
And I'm sorry that it happened.
Just let me talk!

28:05.031 --> 28:07.163
I should not have been
in that position, okay?

28:07.163 --> 28:09.470
And, honestly,
I don't feel great

28:09.470 --> 28:10.689
about how drunk we both were.

28:10.689 --> 28:14.867
And I just-- just wanted
to say that I'm...

28:16.477 --> 28:17.608
...sorry.

28:17.608 --> 28:18.958
It was my fault.

28:18.958 --> 28:21.830
Also, if you were worried,
I never told anybody

28:21.830 --> 28:23.310
about it, so...

28:24.093 --> 28:25.051
You done?

28:26.356 --> 28:27.662
Yes.

28:27.662 --> 28:29.272
Good, 'cause I found
the murder weapon.

28:30.578 --> 28:33.102
So... should we go
arrest this guy

28:33.102 --> 28:34.713
or you want to keep
being vulnerable in a dumpster?

28:36.671 --> 28:37.672
Yeah, no, let's go.

28:40.153 --> 28:42.242
Ugh.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.678
Where do I look?

28:43.678 --> 28:45.201
Right into the camera.

28:45.201 --> 28:46.637
Whenever you're ready.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.731
This is for whoever is
holding my daughter, Emma.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.691
We want you to know,
as far as we're concerned,

28:56.691 --> 28:59.868
as soon as the ransom is paid
and Emma is returned safely,

28:59.868 --> 29:01.522
that's the end.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.611
Okay. We got a location.
Let's go!

29:03.611 --> 29:05.526
We're not interested
in justice or retribution.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.093
No! No, please!

29:08.703 --> 29:11.706
We just want her
to come home safely.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.534
Please! Please don't!

29:13.534 --> 29:15.710
Please don't put me in there!
Please! Please!

29:15.710 --> 29:18.713
I beg you, please let her go.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.410
Emma's our world.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.720
She has her whole life
ahead of her.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.288
Just let our baby come home.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.166
Checking back room!

29:37.166 --> 29:39.125
- Emma!
- Clear here!

29:39.125 --> 29:40.779
Emma Campano!

29:42.868 --> 29:44.260
Emma!

30:14.813 --> 30:16.466
This is my fault.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.425
You told me not to pay,
and I didn't listen,

30:18.425 --> 30:20.557
and now she could be dead
or they might kill her.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.124
- I-I...
- No, hey.

30:22.124 --> 30:24.779
We're gonna find her, all right?
We will.

30:30.654 --> 30:31.873
Trent.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.788
No connection between
Evan Bernard and Warren,

30:33.788 --> 30:36.182
but Kayla and Emma
were a part of a group of girls

30:36.182 --> 30:37.792
who recorded a song
at Warren's studio.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.098
Really?

30:39.098 --> 30:41.796
Yep. "We've Only Just Begun"
by The Carpenters.

30:41.796 --> 30:43.145
For graduation.

30:43.145 --> 30:44.494
Mary Clark was the chaperone.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.195
O-kay.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.024
Where are you going?

30:53.895 --> 30:57.812
<i>â™ª We've only just begunâ™ª</i>

30:57.812 --> 30:58.987
<i>â™ª To liveâ™ª</i>

30:58.987 --> 31:02.077
The girls were really proud
of this.

31:02.077 --> 31:04.384
- Yeah, um, sounds great.
-<i>â™ª White lace and promisesâ™ª</i>

31:04.384 --> 31:06.081
Do you remember anything,

31:06.081 --> 31:07.517
anything at all,
about Warren Grier?

31:07.517 --> 31:10.477
I don't. I was pretty
focused on the girls.

31:10.477 --> 31:12.827
We believe Evan Bernard's
working with an accomplice

31:12.827 --> 31:13.828
and that person's
connected to Warren.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.004
<i>â™ª We've only begunâ™ª</i>

31:16.004 --> 31:18.006
Do you happen to have
a list of the girls

31:18.006 --> 31:19.355
that were at
the recording studio?

31:19.355 --> 31:21.270
-<i>â™ª We flyâ™ª</i>
- I'm sure I do.

31:21.270 --> 31:24.317
Uh, let me check.

31:24.317 --> 31:26.362
<i>â™ª So many roads... â™ª</i>

31:32.368 --> 31:33.543
<i>â™ª White lace and promisesâ™ª</i>

31:33.543 --> 31:35.023
Could I use your bathroom?

31:35.023 --> 31:37.852
Oh, sure. Down the hall
and to your right.

31:37.852 --> 31:43.249
<i>â™ª A kiss for luck,

<i>â™ª We'll start out walkin'

32:02.137 --> 32:03.878
Slide the gun over here, please.

32:03.878 --> 32:06.576
Mary, listen to me.
This isn't you, okay?

32:06.576 --> 32:09.101
- Do it!
- Okay.

32:09.101 --> 32:11.886
All right. Easy.

32:11.886 --> 32:13.366
All right? Easy.

32:13.366 --> 32:17.239
<i>â™ª Ahh, ahhâ™ª</i>

32:17.239 --> 32:18.937
There's still time
to fix this, ok--

32:24.986 --> 32:28.381
<i>â™ª Ahh, ahh,
ooh, ooh, ooh, oohâ™ª</i>

32:28.381 --> 32:30.644
Mary, your hands are shaking.

32:30.644 --> 32:32.907
I know you don't want
to hurt anybody, all right?

32:32.907 --> 32:35.997
Me neither. Put the gun down.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.916
This-- This is why
you keep me in the loop!

32:41.916 --> 32:46.660
<i>â™ª We've only just begunâ™ª</i>

32:53.145 --> 32:56.931
Mary, we're just sitting here.
Time is not our friend.

32:56.931 --> 33:01.066
Your parents filed a rape charge
against Evan Bernard in 2004,

33:01.066 --> 33:03.807
but you refused to testify?

33:03.807 --> 33:05.418
Why?

33:05.418 --> 33:07.986
Her parents are going crazy.
Can't you empathize with that?

33:12.120 --> 33:13.643
You're protecting a monster.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.038
You're okay with that?

33:18.997 --> 33:21.477
You don't know anything.

33:30.617 --> 33:32.358
Come on!

33:40.279 --> 33:42.107
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.543
I just closed my first homicide.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.938
Coming for your clearance rate.

33:47.938 --> 33:50.593
And this is how I celebrate,
which is very sad.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.335
I need a favor.

33:53.335 --> 33:55.076
Two? In a day?

33:55.076 --> 33:56.425
This is a record for you.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.428
I'm trying to get
this woman to talk.

33:59.428 --> 34:00.995
She's Evan Bernard's
accomplice.

34:00.995 --> 34:03.084
He raped her
when she was in high school.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.477
She's not giving him up.

34:04.477 --> 34:06.914
But I know she knows
where Emma is.

34:06.914 --> 34:08.133
Can you talk to her?

34:10.048 --> 34:11.049
What do you want me to say?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.228
I want you to talk
about your mom.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.236
She in there?

34:27.978 --> 34:30.024
My mother was
the most beautiful woman

34:30.024 --> 34:31.547
I've ever seen.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.725
Drug addicts
can be so charming.

34:37.988 --> 34:39.947
I was 5...

34:42.341 --> 34:44.082
...the first time
she pimped me out.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.215
She'd leave me with men
for days.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.741
She made some good money off me.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.136
Is this true?

34:58.183 --> 34:59.271
Yeah.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.970
<i>I wanted her to love me.</i>

35:05.320 --> 35:07.279
Her attention
was my first drug.

35:09.890 --> 35:12.110
I loved her right up until
I found her OD'd in the bathroom

35:12.110 --> 35:13.415
when I was 7.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.551
So I know what it's like

35:18.551 --> 35:21.989
to want the love
of a terrible person.

35:25.123 --> 35:29.083
He did hideous things to me.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.172
But then he looked at me

35:31.172 --> 35:34.567
like I was the only woman
in the world.

35:34.567 --> 35:36.090
How about you break free?

35:40.138 --> 35:42.009
I bet that would feel so good.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.146
What did he ask you
to do with Emma?

35:51.149 --> 35:54.935
He wanted me to kill her.

35:54.935 --> 35:57.155
But I couldn't do it. I...

35:57.155 --> 35:58.895
I-I put her in the trunk,

35:58.895 --> 36:02.769
and I drove her out
to the creek off Old Mill Road.

36:04.945 --> 36:08.122
Pull up the file.
See who was first on scene.

36:24.051 --> 36:25.922
Get a hook!

36:28.577 --> 36:30.492
Go! Get it open! Come on!

36:30.492 --> 36:32.973
Open it! Open it! Come on!

36:32.973 --> 36:34.148
Emma!

36:36.672 --> 36:38.021
It's okay, sweetheart.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.024
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

36:42.548 --> 36:44.245
You're safe now. Okay?
You're safe.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.595
You're safe. You're okay.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.989
Come on. Come on.

36:48.989 --> 36:52.079
You're safe, baby.
Let's go. Let's go.

36:52.079 --> 36:53.602
Come on, baby.
Come on. Come on.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.256
We've got you. Come on.

37:06.180 --> 37:09.270
Right.
He's already been processed.

37:10.576 --> 37:14.232
You know, growing up
in the system...

37:14.232 --> 37:16.190
I learned there are
a lot of adults out there

37:16.190 --> 37:17.974
that are supposed to help kids.

37:19.062 --> 37:22.805
And instead,
they treat them like prey.

37:22.805 --> 37:25.547
Kind of why I got into
this line of work.

37:25.547 --> 37:27.462
So you can imagine

37:27.462 --> 37:29.421
it's pretty satisfying
to come in here

37:29.421 --> 37:34.164
and tell you that
we found Emma... alive.

37:34.164 --> 37:36.689
And we got a witness
who's gonna tell us

37:36.689 --> 37:37.820
everything you did.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.478
You're going away, Evan.

37:53.967 --> 37:54.881
We did it.

37:57.275 --> 38:02.280
Okay. Do we have anything
you want to say to me?

38:03.324 --> 38:04.847
You did okay.

38:09.591 --> 38:11.593
Will, get a chair in here.

38:11.593 --> 38:13.247
If I get a chair,
then people are gonna come

38:13.247 --> 38:14.683
into my office and sit in it.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.425
Good job today, you two.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.297
I think I'm gonna keep
this little experiment going.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.258
And, Faith,
we gotta get you a desk.

38:32.266 --> 38:34.573
I'll leave you to the paperwork.
See you tomorrow.

38:34.573 --> 38:37.271
"Amazing job today, Faith!"

38:37.271 --> 38:38.968
"Thank you for saving my life

38:38.968 --> 38:41.406
while a Carpenters song
was playing, Faith!"

38:41.406 --> 38:43.669
"Whoo, girl, you are rockin'
that outfit today, Faith!"

38:43.669 --> 38:45.323
"Thank you. I know."

38:53.548 --> 38:56.682
Hey. We still on?

38:56.682 --> 38:59.554
Yeah. I-I took another shift. Um...

39:01.861 --> 39:04.864
Okay, look. That was
a lot to ask. I know, okay?

39:04.864 --> 39:08.084
- Yeah.
- But I needed to find that girl.

39:08.084 --> 39:10.173
I knew it had to be real.
We didn't have time.

39:10.173 --> 39:11.827
Yeah, yeah.
It-- It was the right call.

39:12.872 --> 39:15.353
It just made it clear to me
why we don't work.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.358
All we do is remind each other
how broken we are.

39:20.358 --> 39:24.753
Maybe that's how you feel,
but not for me.

39:24.753 --> 39:27.321
I look at you, I see
the one person that saved me.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.282
Come on.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.376
That's your new dog walker.

39:40.029 --> 39:42.118
- What?
- That is Nico.

39:42.118 --> 39:45.252
Pronouns-- they/them.
Sweet kid. Runaway.

39:45.252 --> 39:48.037
I already gave them
my key to your place.

39:53.347 --> 39:54.914
Great.

39:59.484 --> 40:04.053
<i>â™ª Another Saturday night

Lighter and brighter?

40:12.192 --> 40:14.107
<i>â™ª I'm in an awful wayâ™ª</i>

40:14.107 --> 40:16.762

Yeah, I get it.
You're a very scary watchdog.

40:20.679 --> 40:23.638
Hey! Nice neighborhood.

40:23.638 --> 40:25.248
If you want to buy some drugs.

40:25.248 --> 40:28.208
What, you want a hook-up?
I can set you up.

40:28.208 --> 40:29.383
I'd have to arrest you
right after, though.

40:29.383 --> 40:32.386
Ha ha ha! Cop humor. Funny.

40:32.386 --> 40:34.214
Oh, what's all this?

40:34.214 --> 40:36.956
I thought a change
would be good.

40:36.956 --> 40:38.784
It's hard for me to sit still.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.481
It's better when I have
a project going on.

40:42.744 --> 40:45.138
- How's Emma?
- Well, you know, she's okay.

40:45.138 --> 40:48.228
Sleeps a lot. I don't know.

40:48.228 --> 40:50.622
I don't know how you come back
from something like that.

40:50.622 --> 40:53.015
We did. Sort of.

40:53.015 --> 40:54.452
You have nightmares?

40:55.453 --> 40:57.933
Four nights out of seven.
Could be worse.

40:57.933 --> 40:59.500
Me too.

Well, whatever.
We're off-again, again.

It's like ordering
from the same restaurant

41:14.602 --> 41:16.822
over and over again even though
they get your order wrong.

41:16.822 --> 41:19.433
And it's expensive and cold.

Sometimes
it doesn't even show up.

How you driving
a thing like that, huh?

41:37.712 --> 41:39.453
Come by the dealership.
We'll get it repainted for you.

41:39.453 --> 41:41.281
How much is that gonna cost me?

41:41.281 --> 41:44.414
Oh, I'll take 10% off.
