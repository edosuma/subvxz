he doesn't know.
- [Mikhail] He doesn't.

01:57.952 --> 02:01.372
If you'll excuse me,
Minister Petrov. Gentlemen.

02:08.170 --> 02:10.172
Are you trying to get me
out of the way, Alexei?

02:11.549 --> 02:13.217
These are messages

02:13.300 --> 02:16.720
between Jack Ryan
and your man Konstantin.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.764
You asked me
to go after Jack Ryan

02:18.848 --> 02:21.183
and put me next to this traitor.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.393
Yeah.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.896
Your assassin
was a double agent.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.565
What does that make you?

02:28.941 --> 02:32.361
- Where is he now?
- Rotting.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.406
Did you set me up, Alexei?

02:35.489 --> 02:37.825
I will remind you I am
the Minister of Defence...

02:37.908 --> 02:40.619
Do you know how many minsters

02:40.703 --> 02:44.290
just disappear
in the middle of the night?

02:44.373 --> 02:49.128
Do you know how many times
mine was the last face they saw?

02:51.380 --> 02:54.800
Jack Ryan failed
to appear in Vienna,

02:54.884 --> 02:58.554
and your errand boy
failed to eliminate me.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.349
Eliminate you?

03:02.433 --> 03:04.184
Why would I do that?

03:04.268 --> 03:06.812
Because I know
what you're doing.

03:06.896 --> 03:09.773
You have resurrected Sokol.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.363
Honestly,

03:16.447 --> 03:20.284
I had no idea Konstantin
was working both sides.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.412
Then it is your problem,
Minister Petrov.

03:23.495 --> 03:26.457
Or maybe someone else
sent him after me?

03:26.540 --> 03:30.878

is pulling the strings.

in Vienna with Konstantin,

a traitor in your midst, huh?

03:43.057 --> 03:45.184
How would they deal with that?

03:45.267 --> 03:48.437
I know how I would deal with it.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.274
Yes, you're right.

03:52.358 --> 03:55.986

03:56.070 --> 04:00.532

04:33.148 --> 04:34.566
Just felt good.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.904
You all right?

04:38.988 --> 04:40.656
Oh, yeah, just...

04:40.739 --> 04:42.282
Still trying
to process the whole

04:42.366 --> 04:44.243
being accused of treason thing.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.120
Part of the reason
I went private.

04:46.203 --> 04:49.248
No politics, no bureaucracy.
You do the job, they pay you.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.291
When they're assholes,
you fire them.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.960
Yeah, or they try to kill you.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.963
Yeah, there's that.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.798
You trust Luka Gocharov?

04:57.881 --> 04:59.675
I believe him about Zubkov.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.303
I wouldn't put uranium sales
past a guy like that.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.139
Sounds like you should know.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.683
Don't get judgy.
Mine is a different world.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.892
All right? You know,
clients like him,

05:08.976 --> 05:10.310
they come with the territory.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.730
- Do they?
- [laughs softly]

05:12.813 --> 05:14.356
Jack.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.775
Zubkov is not a soft target.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.402
Guy's obsessed with security.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.447
He lives in a villa
that is basically a fortress.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.115
He chose Budapest 'cause
it's one of the only places

05:23.198 --> 05:24.324
he hasn't been
charged with a crime.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.659
All the places
he has been charged?

05:25.743 --> 05:26.869
They can't extradite him
from here.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.538
Wait. Does he know
you're ex-CIA?

05:29.621 --> 05:32.291
Yeah, that's kind of
the main selling point.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.044
I mean, we put it
on the website and everything.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.212
Well, it sounds like you have
quite a workup on him.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.173
Oh, I'm sorry, are you asking me

05:39.256 --> 05:40.799
to breach
my professional ethics?

05:40.883 --> 05:42.760
Oh, I'm sorry, did you have any?

05:44.553 --> 05:46.847
Rami's gonna meet us here
with everything we got on him.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.432
And can he dig up
clients, associates,

05:48.515 --> 05:50.684
- addresses, everything?
- He's ex-Mossad.

05:50.768 --> 05:54.271
There is nothing he can't get
and no one he can't get to.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.398
Great.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.484
But once you start digging on
somebody like Zubkov, though,

05:58.567 --> 05:59.902
he's gonna get spooked.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.862
Let's hope so.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.078
[Mike] Rami, show him the file.

06:09.161 --> 06:13.499
Zubkov's got a very cozy
relationship with the police.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.793
They leave him alone
unless he needs them.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.628
And how often does that happen?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.631
Never. No parties, no strangers,
no clients at his villa.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.382
Client meetings
are always in public.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.968
- Usually at high-end
restaurants.
- Right.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.096
'Cause high-end restaurants
have tight security.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.598
He hates to travel.
If you want to meet him,

06:29.681 --> 06:32.434
- it's here, in Budapest.
- He'll make exceptions

06:32.518 --> 06:34.061
for Iraqi warlords,
Syrians, that kind of thing.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.479
For that he goes to Dubai.

06:35.562 --> 06:39.650
But if you're anybody else,
you got to come here.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.655
What the hell
happened in Austria?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.825
Ryan wasn't on the train.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.702
Yeah, I-I'm aware.
Let me clarify.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.663
What did you know,
when did you know it

06:52.746 --> 06:54.706
and why were you even there?

06:54.790 --> 06:56.667
Sir, Ryan is a CIA case officer.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.086
If he's going to be brought in
on espionage charges,

06:59.169 --> 07:00.420
I doubt either of us
would want that

07:00.504 --> 07:01.839
entirely in the hands
of the NSD.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.592
Jack Ryan shooting up Athens
was not a CIA op.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.386
Down the road
you may want it to be.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.595
Optics can shift. You know that.

07:08.679 --> 07:11.849
Did you have any contact
with Ryan in Austria?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.475
That's the reason
why I'm calling you, sir.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.893
Jack did reach out.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.937
And his analysis

07:17.020 --> 07:19.857
is that a rogue faction
outside the Russian government

07:19.940 --> 07:21.859
is using a series of escalations

07:21.942 --> 07:23.569
to bait Russia and NATO
into war.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.071
So everything that looks
like Russia isn't?

07:26.155 --> 07:28.365
You're familiar
with the small wars theory?

07:28.448 --> 07:31.076
- I am.
- According to Jack's source,

07:31.160 --> 07:34.163
these provocations, like
Dmitry Popov's assassination,

07:34.246 --> 07:36.790
are engineered to stoke tensions
between NATO and Russia.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.668
The tipping point will be the
use of the Sokol nuclear device.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.629
Right now, this sounds a lot
more like theory than intel.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.673
The hard intel
is that the uranium

07:44.756 --> 07:46.508
for the Sokol device
is already on the move,

07:46.592 --> 07:48.051
and was provided
by Levan Zubkov.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.637
So what's his source?
Signals? Wiretaps?

07:51.889 --> 07:54.808
HUMINT. Luka Gocharov.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.393
[sighs]

07:56.476 --> 07:58.520
Jesus Christ.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.981
- I know, it's complex.
- Complex?

08:01.064 --> 08:03.358
No, it's pretty simple to me.
You have a senior SVR agent

08:03.442 --> 08:06.445
who is an expert
on disinformation feeding Ryan.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.155
Doesn't this sound
a little textbook to you?

08:08.238 --> 08:09.489
No, it does not, sir.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.241
In my experience,
Ryan is a very good analyst.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.285
Yeah, who's just been duped
by an even better

08:13.368 --> 08:15.913
- Russian spymaster.
- But imagine if he's right.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.707
Then he just turned
Luka Gocharov.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.167
Okay.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.503
I am not in the business
of imagination.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.257
Officer Wright,

08:27.341 --> 08:30.636
I have a lot of respect
for your service and expertise,

08:30.719 --> 08:33.263
but we are way past all that.

08:33.347 --> 08:36.183
I want Jack Ryan
in custody immediately.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.268
If it doesn't happen,
I will recall you

08:38.352 --> 08:41.063
and send someone
who can make that happen.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.317
Yes, sir.

08:51.907 --> 08:54.159
How do we get to him?

08:54.243 --> 08:56.995
You don't.
With Zubkov, it's one-way.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.497
If he needs me, he reaches out.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.791
Guy's a total control freak.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.293
Then let's get him to need you.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.713
till he comes running
to you for protection.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.715
I'll have to go through Georges.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.262
- Georges?
- His right-hand man.
It's the only guy he trusts.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.933
- Pull up his phone.
- Yeah.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.646
[Mike] What's that?

09:24.690 --> 09:26.733
Zubkov and Georges have
a meeting with Ian van der Waal.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.323

09:33.407 --> 09:36.034
Uh...

09:36.118 --> 09:38.996

10:49.066 --> 10:51.985
- Do I know you?
- No, you don't need to.

10:52.069 --> 10:54.029
You, on the other hand,
were supposed to have a meeting

10:54.112 --> 10:57.074
with Levan Zubkov
at Felix Restaurant, but...

10:57.157 --> 10:59.701
that meeting was changed.

10:59.785 --> 11:02.371
You're what, CIA?

11:02.454 --> 11:04.331
[laughs softly]

11:04.414 --> 11:07.667
Zubkov's been compromised.
From the inside.

11:07.751 --> 11:11.421
So now he's gonna
be charged under 2339,

11:11.505 --> 11:14.007
which is material aid
to terrorists.

11:14.091 --> 11:17.427
It also means that anyone who's
been doing business with him,

11:17.511 --> 11:19.262
well, their assets
are gonna be seized

11:19.346 --> 11:20.889
and their businesses
are gonna be shut down

11:20.972 --> 11:22.265
and then... [clicks tongue]

11:22.349 --> 11:24.935
...they, too, will be charged
with providing aid

11:25.018 --> 11:27.396
to terrorists.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.314
Or you can just call him back.

11:32.275 --> 11:35.362
Guess I have to ask why
you're doing me such a solid?

11:35.445 --> 11:38.281
Well, your shipping business
is, uh, barely getting by.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.826
Something like this ends you.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.954
So we just thought,
instead of that or prison,

11:44.037 --> 11:46.206
we'd just give you a warning.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.005
So, chommie,

But I'll tell you this,
