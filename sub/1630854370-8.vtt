WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:11.448 --> 00:12.379
Hey!

00:13.206 --> 00:13.931
Sorry I haven't
called lately, Dad.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.689
Just busy with school.

00:15.689 --> 00:16.827
Uh-huh.

00:16.827 --> 00:17.517
I bet.

00:18.137 --> 00:19.379
So what are you
up to tonight?

00:19.379 --> 00:21.517
Uh, just working
on an assignment.

00:22.344 --> 00:23.724
Interesting choice
of study music.

00:24.551 --> 00:26.241
When I was in school, I
listened to Charlie Parker.

00:26.241 --> 00:27.206
Hey sorry Dad.

00:27.206 --> 00:28.517
I'll call you
tomorrow, okay?

00:28.517 --> 00:30.172
Listen Camilla.

00:30.172 --> 00:31.206
You be safe okay?

00:31.206 --> 00:31.862
Bye.

00:31.862 --> 00:32.758
I love you!

01:01.896 --> 01:03.034
Marisa?

01:35.965 --> 01:37.724
A literal
underground rave.

01:37.724 --> 01:39.689
I didn't know kids still
threw parties like this.

01:39.689 --> 01:40.896
You would know?

01:41.137 --> 01:43.000
Miss 4.0 GPA was going
to college parties?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.413
Oh come on,
you know how it is.

01:45.034 --> 01:46.034
Isn't Heritage
a party school?

01:46.034 --> 01:47.310
I don't know.

01:47.310 --> 01:49.275
I was a little too old for that
kind of thing when I got here.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.206
Oh right.

01:50.206 --> 01:51.931
Yeah, you did that
Kerouac soul-searching-

01:51.931 --> 01:53.517
biker trip after
high school.

01:53.517 --> 01:54.206
Uh-

01:54.206 --> 01:55.275
The road is
my teacher.

01:55.275 --> 01:56.827
Yeah you're never going
to let me live that down.

01:57.137 --> 01:58.172
But you're not wrong.

01:58.689 --> 01:59.551
Okay this is
Marisa Barnes-

01:59.551 --> 02:01.413
according to the
ID in her wallet.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.517
Oddly, we didn't turn
up a phone on her.

02:03.827 --> 02:04.517
Head trauma.

02:04.517 --> 02:05.517
Did she get hit
from behind?

02:05.517 --> 02:06.620
No.

02:06.620 --> 02:08.896
We found traces of blood
on that corner over there.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.586
So likely shoved.

02:10.586 --> 02:12.034
Or hit her head
in a struggle.

02:12.034 --> 02:14.275
Wasn't enough to
kill her though.

02:14.275 --> 02:16.517
Bruises on the neck
probably did the trick.

02:16.517 --> 02:18.103
Petechial hemorrhaging
says yes.

02:18.103 --> 02:20.172
She was likely
strangled to death.

02:20.172 --> 02:21.034
Graffiti-

02:21.034 --> 02:22.206
on the camera.

02:22.206 --> 02:23.275
But party
right next door.

02:23.275 --> 02:25.206
A risky place
to kill.

02:34.862 --> 02:35.517
What is it partner?

02:35.517 --> 02:36.482
You got something?

02:43.344 --> 02:44.000
Huh.

02:44.000 --> 02:44.896
Good find, pal.

02:46.241 --> 02:48.068
Okay, well the tox
report will tell us-

02:48.068 --> 02:49.689
if there was
anything in her system.

02:49.689 --> 02:50.724
Yeah, this
was a big party.

02:50.724 --> 02:51.655
Let's hope
we can find-

02:51.655 --> 02:52.793
a sober witness
to talk to.

02:54.586 --> 02:55.931
There is one person
in particular-

02:55.931 --> 02:57.344
that you might
want to talk to.

02:59.241 --> 03:00.793
Are you
sure you're okay?

03:01.655 --> 03:02.655
Can I get
you anything?

03:02.655 --> 03:03.310
No babe.

03:03.310 --> 03:04.000
I'm okay.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.206
Oh!

03:05.206 --> 03:06.241
Hey you.

03:06.241 --> 03:08.000
I wondered when I'd see
your pretty face here.

03:11.517 --> 03:12.413
Hi Charlie.

03:12.517 --> 03:13.413
Hey Camilla.

03:13.517 --> 03:14.413
Are you all right?

03:14.413 --> 03:15.724
Still processing.

03:15.724 --> 03:17.172
Tell him
what you saw.

03:17.172 --> 03:18.172
I'm fine.

03:18.172 --> 03:19.275
Really.

03:19.275 --> 03:20.275
I'm Detective Charlie Hudson.

03:21.551 --> 03:22.448
Frida Xavier.

03:22.448 --> 03:23.103
Camilla's girlfriend.

03:23.931 --> 03:24.551
Oh!

03:24.551 --> 03:25.275
Nice to meet you.

03:26.379 --> 03:27.413
Frida, do you mind-

03:27.413 --> 03:28.896
if Camilla and I
have a minute?

03:31.724 --> 03:32.379
Thanks.

03:37.758 --> 03:38.965
Did you know Marisa?

03:38.965 --> 03:40.827
Yeah she
was my friend.

03:41.586 --> 03:42.310
A new friend.

03:42.310 --> 03:43.241
Uh-huh?

03:43.241 --> 03:45.068
I haven't
known her long.

03:45.068 --> 03:47.275
I was supposed to
see her here tonight.

03:48.379 --> 03:49.068
I'm sorry.

03:49.068 --> 03:50.724
This must be
really tough.

03:57.310 --> 03:58.586
She was bleeding-

04:00.034 --> 04:00.931
from her head.

04:02.103 --> 04:03.344
Is that what
killed her?

04:04.275 --> 04:05.793
We don't know
for sure yet.

04:06.793 --> 04:07.827
Are there any signs-

04:07.827 --> 04:09.896
students should look
out for a repeat offender?

04:12.275 --> 04:14.068
Okay, I see what's
going on here.

04:14.068 --> 04:16.206
Your dad told me about
your newspaper internship.

04:16.206 --> 04:17.965
Congratulations, by the way.

04:17.965 --> 04:19.137
Thanks.

04:19.137 --> 04:20.620
But here's a phrase you're
going to hear more and more.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.068
No comment.

04:35.068 --> 04:36.241
I
thought we agreed.

04:36.241 --> 04:37.103
No partying.

04:37.103 --> 04:38.206
Focus on your studies.

04:38.206 --> 04:39.275
I told you
the truth.

04:39.275 --> 04:40.241
What?

04:40.241 --> 04:41.827
That you were working
on an assignment?

04:41.827 --> 04:43.000
In an underground rave?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.758
I'm writing a piece
on campus culture-

04:45.758 --> 04:47.137
for my newspaper internship.

04:47.137 --> 04:49.896
Right, and that piece
requires you being involved-

04:49.896 --> 04:51.103
in that campus culture?

04:52.137 --> 04:53.862
My professor says journalism-

04:53.862 --> 04:56.000
is nine-tenths being in the
right place at the right time.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.689
Yeah, well I'm glad to see your
tuition dollars hard at work.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.827
Is this about Mom?

05:07.551 --> 05:09.172
Listen Camilla.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.655
You've seen first hand-

05:16.241 --> 05:17.793
that partying is
a slippery slope.

05:20.344 --> 05:21.379
Dad.

05:21.379 --> 05:22.620
We talked about this.

05:22.931 --> 05:23.896
A lot.

05:25.034 --> 05:26.275
You can trust me.

05:32.000 --> 05:32.620
Okay.

05:32.620 --> 05:33.448
Well just um-

05:34.344 --> 05:35.862
stay close by okay?

05:36.655 --> 05:38.034
We may have more
questions for you.

05:47.793 --> 05:48.724
Caffeine.

05:48.827 --> 05:49.931
How do
you do that?

05:49.931 --> 05:51.655
What- read your mind?

05:51.758 --> 05:53.517
I know how these late
night/early morning cases-

05:53.517 --> 05:54.862
really get to you.

05:54.862 --> 05:55.724
You got anything?

05:55.724 --> 05:57.517
We rushed a
preliminary examination.

05:57.517 --> 06:00.206
We found traces of
chloroform on Marisa's neck.

06:00.793 --> 06:01.655
Chloroform.

06:02.827 --> 06:05.310
Oh, so somebody knocked
her out before strangling her.

06:05.310 --> 06:06.448
Strangely, no.

06:06.448 --> 06:08.310
I couldn't detect anything
around her nose or mouth.

06:14.448 --> 06:15.172
Ha.

06:15.172 --> 06:16.068
You've got
that look again.

06:16.931 --> 06:17.655
What look?

06:17.655 --> 06:18.413
Just, you know-

06:18.413 --> 06:20.482
you go somewhere
when you focus.

06:22.172 --> 06:25.034
I've always loved watching you
work things out in real time.

06:25.034 --> 06:26.551
Really?

06:26.551 --> 06:29.103
Are we still
on for Friday?

06:29.103 --> 06:30.103
Yeah of course.

06:30.103 --> 06:31.517
We can't
back out now.

06:31.517 --> 06:32.413
How heartbreaking
would that be?

06:40.482 --> 06:41.448
Hey guys!

06:41.551 --> 06:42.206
Hey!

06:43.172 --> 06:43.862
Everything all right?

06:44.517 --> 06:45.310
Yeah great.

06:46.103 --> 06:46.862
Um-

06:46.862 --> 06:48.310
you got something
for us Jesse?

06:48.310 --> 06:49.655
Uh- yeah, yeah.

06:49.655 --> 06:50.517
The source of the-

06:50.517 --> 06:52.000
baggie found on Marisa.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.586
Adrian Svirsky is the
campus drug dealer.

06:53.586 --> 06:54.482
I set up
a buy.

06:54.586 --> 06:55.172
Great.

06:55.172 --> 06:56.172
When?

06:56.172 --> 06:57.655
Well, Donovan and I are
on our way there now.

06:57.758 --> 07:00.034
Joe's going to go question
a low level drug dealer?

07:00.034 --> 07:00.758
Yeah.

07:00.758 --> 07:02.068
Um- look.

07:02.931 --> 07:03.965
You didn't hear
it from me.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.862
But I think he's pretty
worried about Camilla.

07:06.862 --> 07:08.275
Well that makes sense-

07:08.275 --> 07:10.655
given her mother's
history of drug abuse.

07:10.655 --> 07:11.517
Right, of course.

07:16.172 --> 07:17.413
Is there something else?

07:17.413 --> 07:18.448
Yes.

07:18.448 --> 07:20.241
No, well nothing to do
with the case actually.

07:20.241 --> 07:21.724
We're still on
for Friday, right?

07:23.413 --> 07:24.137
Oh.

07:24.137 --> 07:25.689
I didn't know
we had plans.

07:25.689 --> 07:27.896
I've got dinner
reservations already.

07:27.896 --> 07:28.793
Me too.

07:28.793 --> 07:29.517
Not dinner.

07:29.655 --> 07:30.310
Something else.

07:32.206 --> 07:32.862
Oh!

07:32.862 --> 07:33.758
Yeah.

07:33.758 --> 07:36.000
I mean, I did ask
like a month ago.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.310
At least, so-

07:37.931 --> 07:39.206
Drinks next Friday
at the pub instead?

07:39.206 --> 07:40.034
Yeah.

07:40.034 --> 07:41.000
Of course.

07:41.827 --> 07:42.620
Okay.

07:49.413 --> 07:50.344
Good job, partner.

08:00.793 --> 08:01.586
Adrian?

08:03.172 --> 08:05.000
I brought you that
muffin like you asked.

08:10.931 --> 08:11.758
Blueberry.

08:12.965 --> 08:14.241
My favourite.

08:27.758 --> 08:28.413
What's this?

08:28.413 --> 08:29.310
Some kind
of set up?

08:29.965 --> 08:31.000
Adrian Svirsky.

08:31.896 --> 08:33.413
I think it's time
we have a chat.

08:35.344 --> 08:36.172
Have a seat.

08:38.689 --> 08:39.965
That's a lot
of ADHD meds-

08:39.965 --> 08:41.413
for someone who doesn't
have a prescription.

08:41.413 --> 08:42.586
Yeah, it's exam season.

08:42.586 --> 08:44.206
A lot of people could
use a focus buddy.

08:44.310 --> 08:45.034
Right.

08:46.000 --> 08:46.896
We have witnesses-

08:46.896 --> 08:48.482
who place you at a
tunnel party last night.

08:48.482 --> 08:50.275
Is that a good
place to deal?

08:50.275 --> 08:51.655
No I didn't sell
anything last night.

08:51.655 --> 08:52.896
I stopped by
to see a friend.

08:52.896 --> 08:53.827
Marisa Barnes?

08:53.827 --> 08:54.965
You can't go
through my phone!

08:54.965 --> 08:55.758
According to your texts-

08:55.758 --> 08:56.724
you guys were
more than friends.

08:56.724 --> 08:57.758
Can he look
through my phone?

08:57.758 --> 08:58.896
He's looking through
your phone.

08:58.896 --> 09:00.275
Someone in your business
really should set a password.

09:00.275 --> 09:01.206
But you guys
split up.

09:01.206 --> 09:02.034
I mean-

09:02.034 --> 09:03.482
She hasn't responded
to you in weeks.

09:04.931 --> 09:06.310
What does this have
to do with anything?

09:06.310 --> 09:09.034
See, your stash matches
a baggie that we found-

09:09.034 --> 09:10.275
on Marisa's
body last night.

09:12.137 --> 09:13.172
Agent Mills.

09:13.172 --> 09:15.068
What was the last text
message he sent to Marisa?

09:15.068 --> 09:15.931
I need to
see you.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.724
45 last night.

09:18.344 --> 09:19.379
No response.

09:20.586 --> 09:22.137
How did you know
she was going to the party?

09:23.275 --> 09:24.689
We had tracking apps
on each other's phones-

09:24.689 --> 09:25.931
when we were dating.

09:25.931 --> 09:27.000
In case of emergencies.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.137
So you stalked
her there.

09:28.137 --> 09:28.896
It wasn't like that.

09:28.896 --> 09:29.620
What was it like?

09:29.620 --> 09:31.000
I came to
warn her.

09:31.000 --> 09:31.862
About what?

09:33.206 --> 09:36.517
This student page
on Instagram-

09:36.517 --> 09:37.241
Campus Call Out-

09:37.241 --> 09:39.620
posted that-

09:39.620 --> 09:40.758
my ecstasy-

09:41.655 --> 09:42.551
was laced.

09:43.241 --> 09:44.103
Was it?

09:44.620 --> 09:45.586
I didn't know-

09:45.586 --> 09:47.413
until a lot of it
had gotten out.

09:49.655 --> 09:50.862
Including to Marisa.

09:52.413 --> 09:53.655
I didn't mean
to hurt her.

09:54.551 --> 09:56.758
But when I got there, she
was already on the ground.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.068
I knew I was
too late.

10:01.758 --> 10:02.827
And I ran.

10:12.758 --> 10:14.068
I don't
believe Adrian's guilty.

10:14.068 --> 10:14.965
Even if he does.

10:14.965 --> 10:15.793
You're right.

10:15.793 --> 10:17.448
Marisa's tox report
came back clean.

10:17.448 --> 10:18.482
So we're back
to square one.

10:18.482 --> 10:19.586
Not necessarily.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.517
If Adrian was able to
track Marisa to the party-

10:21.517 --> 10:22.931
it means she did
her phone on her.

10:22.931 --> 10:24.655
But we didn't
find the phone on the body.

10:24.655 --> 10:25.862
Do you think
the killer took it?

10:25.862 --> 10:26.896
That's what I'm hoping.

10:26.896 --> 10:27.931
Jesse, any luck
tracking that phone?

10:27.931 --> 10:28.620
Uh yeah.

10:28.620 --> 10:29.448
Yeah, but
you know what?

10:29.448 --> 10:30.137
It's weird.

10:30.137 --> 10:31.586
The most recent ping-

10:31.586 --> 10:33.965
has the phone placed
somewhere inside the station.

10:33.965 --> 10:36.137
The call is coming
from inside the house?

10:36.137 --> 10:37.068
I like that reference.

10:37.068 --> 10:37.724
But yeah.

10:37.724 --> 10:38.482
No.

10:38.482 --> 10:39.655
It must be some
sort of glitch.

10:41.137 --> 10:42.137
I don't think
it's a glitch.

10:43.275 --> 10:44.000
Charlie, I need you-

10:44.103 --> 10:45.689
to prime Rex to
Marisa's scent.

10:46.517 --> 10:47.896
I need you
to do it now.

10:55.862 --> 10:56.827
Hi cutie!

10:57.724 --> 10:58.655
Hi!

11:02.517 --> 11:03.586
Cough it up.

11:04.241 --> 11:05.137
Cough what up?

11:06.793 --> 11:08.724
If I have to ask
you again, young lady-

11:08.724 --> 11:10.448
it'll be after I've
read you your rights.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.241
Cough it up.

11:34.310 --> 11:35.206
You
could be charged-

11:35.206 --> 11:36.344
with obstruction of justice-

11:36.344 --> 11:37.551
for a stunt
like this.

11:38.137 --> 11:39.931
I was going to
give it in today.

11:39.931 --> 11:41.689
I just needed it
for a little while.

11:41.689 --> 11:43.551
And when did you decide
to steal the phone huh?

11:43.551 --> 11:45.620
Was it before or after
you called in her death?

11:45.620 --> 11:47.000
I was in shock!

11:47.000 --> 11:49.103
I didn't even realize
I'd taken it until after!

11:49.103 --> 11:51.586
Look every second that
that phone was missing-

11:51.586 --> 11:53.275
was crucial
to our case.

11:53.275 --> 11:54.827
Why did you even
want it that badly?

11:54.827 --> 11:56.965
That story I'm writing
is about Marisa.

11:58.344 --> 11:59.344
There were photos
on that phone-

11:59.344 --> 12:00.448
that I needed
for the article.

12:01.206 --> 12:03.103
Why would the Tribune
even want to do a profile-

12:03.103 --> 12:04.310
on a college student?

12:05.103 --> 12:06.827
She was changing
things at Heritage.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.586
For months-

12:08.586 --> 12:10.068
she was running this
Instagram account-

12:10.068 --> 12:10.896
Campus Call Out.

12:11.310 --> 12:12.310
Campus Call Out?

12:13.448 --> 12:15.137
Yeah, Marisa's drug
dealer boyfriend-

12:15.137 --> 12:16.000
talked about
that account.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.379
He said that they-

12:17.379 --> 12:19.551
they made a post about
his drugs being laced.

12:19.551 --> 12:20.517
Yeah and it worked.

12:20.517 --> 12:22.551
There have been zero
overdoses on campus.

12:22.551 --> 12:24.275
That's what The Call
Out was about.

12:24.275 --> 12:27.241
A voice to expose ongoing
issues on campus.

12:27.241 --> 12:28.310
What kinds of issues?

12:28.310 --> 12:29.206
Professors-

12:29.206 --> 12:31.206
accused of grading unfairly.

12:31.206 --> 12:32.379
Which guys were known-

12:32.379 --> 12:34.034
serial party predators.

12:34.034 --> 12:35.448
Fights breaking out
at the campus bar.

12:35.448 --> 12:36.103
Things like that.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.068
We're talking about gossip.

12:38.068 --> 12:39.137
I mean, that
kind of thing-

12:39.137 --> 12:40.724
could garner Marisa
all kinds of enemies.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.517
Yeah, the comment
section could get heated.

12:43.517 --> 12:46.137
But she was
totally anonymous.

12:46.137 --> 12:46.827
Not even Adrian knew-

12:46.827 --> 12:48.448
she ran the account.

12:48.448 --> 12:49.655
So how did
you find out?

12:49.655 --> 12:51.206
I saw the effect
The Call Out-

12:51.206 --> 12:52.206
was having on campus-

12:52.206 --> 12:54.413
and gave the
page a DM-

12:54.413 --> 12:55.551
promising anonymity.

12:55.551 --> 12:56.724
She agreed to meet
for an interview.

12:56.724 --> 12:58.000
Okay.

12:58.000 --> 12:58.965
Let me get
this straight.

12:58.965 --> 13:01.551
First you steal evidence
from a crime scene.

13:01.551 --> 13:02.689
Right?

13:02.689 --> 13:05.517
Then you decide withhold
information about a victim?

13:05.517 --> 13:06.482
Camilla you
are my daughter!

13:06.482 --> 13:07.862
You are supposed to
know better than this!

13:07.862 --> 13:10.758
I didn't think it had anything
to do about her murder!

13:10.758 --> 13:13.896
Nobody knew that Marisa
was behind the account!

13:15.241 --> 13:16.000
You know what?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.241
We're going to
keep it that way.

13:17.241 --> 13:19.724
Any article that you plan
on publishing is on ice-

13:19.724 --> 13:20.724
until this case-

13:20.724 --> 13:21.724
is closed.

13:22.206 --> 13:23.551
I can see
the headlines.

13:23.551 --> 13:25.241
SJPD Silences Press.

13:25.241 --> 13:26.206
You can't do that.

13:27.275 --> 13:29.137
Then I'm asking
you as my daughter.

13:30.275 --> 13:31.862
You've already made my
team's job hard enough.

13:42.172 --> 13:42.862
I mean Marisa-

13:42.862 --> 13:44.137
she was thorough.

13:44.137 --> 13:46.241
These Campus Call Out
posts weren't just gossip.

13:46.241 --> 13:47.620
She has multiple
sources cited-

13:47.620 --> 13:48.827
behind all these rumours.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.137
What was she
working on recently?

13:50.137 --> 13:50.793
Well-

13:50.793 --> 13:51.758
an anthropology TA-

13:51.758 --> 13:54.172
was taking bribes
for higher essay marks.

13:54.172 --> 13:56.517
A party DJ was preying
on freshman girls.

13:56.517 --> 13:58.206
All kinds of people
got cancelled.

13:58.206 --> 14:00.310
Yeah most people don't
like this kind of attention.

14:00.310 --> 14:02.931
Is there any way someone could
track her ID through this site?

14:02.931 --> 14:04.068
Not that
I can see.

14:04.068 --> 14:06.517
She hid her digital tracks
remarkably well, but-

14:06.517 --> 14:07.517
I'll do some digging-

14:07.517 --> 14:09.000
to see if any of these
angry comments jump out.

14:09.000 --> 14:09.724
Mm-hmm.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.000
Yeah, check out
all the alibis-

14:11.000 --> 14:12.655
of the people she's called out
recently while you're at it.

14:12.655 --> 14:14.689
Rex and I are going to go
check out Marisa's dorm room.

14:14.689 --> 14:15.379
Come on pal.

14:19.379 --> 14:20.379
Any plans for Friday?

14:21.827 --> 14:22.482
No.

14:22.827 --> 14:23.965
No Jesse.

14:23.965 --> 14:25.379
We'll be working overtime
until this case is solved.

14:25.379 --> 14:26.206
Really?

14:26.206 --> 14:27.275
Well I mean, it's
only Wednesday.

14:27.275 --> 14:28.724
Plenty of time
to put it to bed.

14:28.724 --> 14:29.517
Yeah.

14:37.413 --> 14:38.620
Hi.

14:38.620 --> 14:41.551
Yeah, I have a cake order
I'd like to cancel for Friday?

14:42.758 --> 14:46.379
Yeah, the one that reads
Happy 30th Birthday Jesse.

14:46.379 --> 14:47.827
That one.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.689
I guess I don't need to tell you
what room we're looking for.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.379
What happened here?

15:45.137 --> 15:45.862
Delete those.

15:45.965 --> 15:47.137
Now.

15:47.137 --> 15:48.000
Now!

15:48.000 --> 15:48.931
It's a crime scene!

15:48.931 --> 15:50.793
I need photos
for my article!

15:50.793 --> 15:52.482
Marisa promised me
pictures of her workspace.

15:52.586 --> 15:54.068
You told me
that nobody knew-

15:54.068 --> 15:55.655
that Marisa was part
of Campus Call Out.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.034
This doesn't
seem so secret.

16:01.137 --> 16:02.689
I thought
no one knew.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.310
Maybe I just-

16:05.310 --> 16:07.379
didn't want to believe someone
would kill her over this.

16:07.379 --> 16:08.344
Which is why
it's important-

16:08.344 --> 16:10.103
that you work
with us here.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.862
And stay
out of this-

16:11.862 --> 16:13.103
until we can get
some straight answers.

16:13.103 --> 16:13.758
Okay?

16:13.758 --> 16:14.413
Okay, Charlie.

16:14.413 --> 16:15.206
All right.

16:15.206 --> 16:15.896
That means now.

16:15.896 --> 16:16.551
Hey Charlie!

16:16.551 --> 16:17.241
Delete.

16:17.793 --> 16:18.655
And-

16:18.655 --> 16:19.965
you made
me do it.

16:20.965 --> 16:21.724
Okay, Rex.

16:21.724 --> 16:22.413
Can you- ?

16:22.413 --> 16:23.551
Go.

16:23.551 --> 16:24.379
Ughhh!

16:32.758 --> 16:33.862
Hey Charlie.

16:33.862 --> 16:34.655
Hey Jesse.

16:34.655 --> 16:35.586
We've got another
crime scene.

16:35.586 --> 16:37.172
I need you to send
Sarah and her team down.

16:37.172 --> 16:38.689
Yeah, right away.

16:38.689 --> 16:39.827
Hey listen.

16:39.827 --> 16:41.275
I have that info on the
Call Out's targets for you.

16:41.275 --> 16:44.448
Most of Marisa's recent subjects
had alibis for last night.

16:44.448 --> 16:46.137
Except for one I haven't
been able to reach.

16:49.931 --> 16:51.586
Campus Call
Out didn't mince words-

16:51.586 --> 16:53.000
in their post
about you.

16:54.137 --> 16:57.482
Grant Evans is a danger
to all women on campus.

16:57.482 --> 17:00.448
He is a predator who brandishes
his charisma like a weapon.

17:00.448 --> 17:03.413
Hey, at least they called
me charismatic, right?

17:03.413 --> 17:04.413
You think
this is funny?

17:07.000 --> 17:07.758
No.

17:07.758 --> 17:09.344
It was hard to
hear at the time.

17:09.586 --> 17:10.896
Still is.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.793
You wrote underneath
the post-

17:14.620 --> 17:15.482
You better hope-

17:15.482 --> 17:17.241
I don't find out
who runs this account.

17:17.241 --> 17:17.965
Why is that?

17:17.965 --> 17:18.931
What were you
planning to do?

17:18.931 --> 17:19.965
Nothing.

17:19.965 --> 17:22.827
I was just talking
about taking legal action.

17:23.551 --> 17:24.517
I was furious.

17:26.068 --> 17:27.206
And I was ashamed.

17:29.896 --> 17:32.586
What were the
accusations, exactly?

17:33.551 --> 17:34.793
I used to
be the DJ-

17:34.793 --> 17:37.310
that everyone wanted
at their parties.

17:37.310 --> 17:38.758
Uh-huh.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.620
It gave me the
opportunity to-

17:40.620 --> 17:42.482
meet all the new
freshmen girls.

17:43.206 --> 17:44.310
Maybe flirt a little.

17:45.103 --> 17:45.758
Uh-huh.

17:46.344 --> 17:47.344
And yeah-

17:47.344 --> 17:48.965
maybe I brought a couple
of them back to my dorm.

17:48.965 --> 17:49.965
Yeah, and I'm guessing-

17:49.965 --> 17:52.068
this was usually after
they'd had a few drinks?

17:52.068 --> 17:53.068
Am I right?

17:53.068 --> 17:54.344
I'm not
proud of it.

17:57.172 --> 17:59.000
After the Campus Call Out
thing was published-

17:59.000 --> 17:59.862
everything stopped.

17:59.862 --> 18:01.655
DJ gigs dried up.

18:02.103 --> 18:03.655
My friends
cut me off.

18:04.344 --> 18:05.655
But I needed that.

18:05.655 --> 18:06.931
A dose of reality,
you know?

18:06.931 --> 18:09.413
Campus Call Out
did you a favour?

18:10.310 --> 18:12.827
I'm glad I was held accountable
before things got worse.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.034
I take it you weren't at this
tunnel party last night.

18:17.620 --> 18:19.000
No.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.172
I am persona non grata
there these days.

18:22.172 --> 18:23.689
Plus I was working
a night shift-

18:23.689 --> 18:25.620
mopping up lecture halls.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.931
This your work uniform?

18:27.931 --> 18:29.448
Yeah, part of
my atonement.

18:29.448 --> 18:31.827
My parents cut off
my academic allowance.

18:31.827 --> 18:35.241
So I do custodial
work on campus now.

18:35.241 --> 18:38.620
It gives me time
to think things over.

18:39.965 --> 18:42.689
Why do you want to know
about that tunnel party?

18:42.689 --> 18:43.586
Was Marisa Barnes-

18:43.586 --> 18:44.793
behind Campus Call Out?

18:44.793 --> 18:46.827
I can't divulge
that information.

18:48.724 --> 18:49.896
I wish I could've
thanked her.

18:50.482 --> 18:52.000
I was kind of hoping
I'd get the chance-

18:52.000 --> 18:53.310
after the article
was published.

18:56.275 --> 18:57.482
What article?

19:01.379 --> 19:03.931
Hey there,
beautiful boy!

19:04.620 --> 19:06.310
Come on, give
him some love.

19:06.310 --> 19:06.965
No thanks.

19:06.965 --> 19:07.655
I'm good here.

19:07.655 --> 19:08.862
You're working Rex.

19:10.379 --> 19:11.379
So-

19:11.379 --> 19:13.482
I just had a conversation
with Grant Evans.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.137
You interviewed
him too apparently?

19:16.827 --> 19:18.758
So first you want me
to stay out of your way.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.310
And now you want
my help again?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.517
For my article, yeah.

19:24.517 --> 19:25.758
I needed both sides-

19:25.758 --> 19:26.862
the Campus Call Out-

19:26.862 --> 19:28.965
and how the people she
reported on were affected.

19:28.965 --> 19:30.689
Reporting is a
strong word, Cam.

19:32.413 --> 19:33.310
So um-

19:33.310 --> 19:34.862
so did you buy his
whole reformed act?

19:34.862 --> 19:36.344
I don't think
it's an act.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.482
I think she did
some good with him.

19:48.793 --> 19:49.448
Whoa whoa.

19:49.448 --> 19:50.137
What's he doing now?

19:53.172 --> 19:54.000
His job.

19:54.931 --> 19:56.206
That paint.

19:56.206 --> 19:57.724
You recognize that shade?

19:59.379 --> 20:00.586
The graffiti.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.620
Frida, what
did you do?

20:13.344 --> 20:15.689
You sure you
should be doing this?

20:15.689 --> 20:17.620
Charlie or Sarah
can handle it.

20:17.620 --> 20:19.172
Yeah this is not
exactly the way-

20:19.172 --> 20:20.344
I wanted to meet
Camilla's new girlfriend.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.172
But-

20:21.965 --> 20:22.620
I'll be okay.

20:23.965 --> 20:25.344
Are we sure she
looks good for this?

20:25.344 --> 20:26.793
Well Sarah's testing
the paint on her fingers-

20:26.793 --> 20:28.448
against the graffiti
in the victim's room.

20:28.448 --> 20:29.793
But the colour sure
seems to match.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.413
Do we have any
dirt on Frida-

20:31.413 --> 20:32.827
on the victim's
Instagram account?

20:32.827 --> 20:34.586
Well Frida never interacted
with The Call Out directly.

20:34.586 --> 20:36.482
But Instagram
does has a function-

20:36.482 --> 20:37.689
where if you block
a person's account-

20:37.689 --> 20:38.931
then any other account-

20:38.931 --> 20:39.793
registered to that person-

20:39.793 --> 20:40.758
Okay Jesse, just-

20:40.758 --> 20:42.103
I logged into
Marisa's account.

20:42.103 --> 20:43.034
I blocked Frida.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.413
And then dozens of
other hateful comments-

20:44.413 --> 20:45.344
on The Call
Out's posts-

20:45.344 --> 20:46.344
just disappeared.

20:48.000 --> 20:48.862
Frida runs six
other accounts-

20:48.862 --> 20:49.862
just to harass Marisa.

20:49.862 --> 20:50.551
Look.

20:52.379 --> 20:53.034
Yeah.

20:54.206 --> 20:56.344
Oh this generation has too
much time on their hands.

21:00.448 --> 21:01.275
Frida.

21:02.586 --> 21:03.482
Mr. Donovan.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.344
It's nice to
finally meet you.

21:05.344 --> 21:06.827
Even if it's here.

21:08.379 --> 21:10.862
Camilla tells me you're the
editor of the student paper.

21:11.689 --> 21:12.689
Mm-hmm.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.689
You really seem to
have a way with words.

21:14.689 --> 21:16.068
Um-

21:17.000 --> 21:19.068
Stop hiding, you liar.

21:19.620 --> 21:22.620
Scum of the campus.

21:22.620 --> 21:23.517
You better
watch your back.

21:23.517 --> 21:25.655
I'm gonna
sniff you out.

21:26.448 --> 21:29.655
We connected these comments
on the Campus Call Out-

21:29.655 --> 21:30.655
to you, Frida.

21:32.620 --> 21:34.862
I was just trying to make
whoever ran Campus Call Out-

21:34.862 --> 21:36.344
rethink what
they were doing.

21:36.344 --> 21:38.793
Posting all kinds of
unsubstantiated rumours.

21:39.586 --> 21:40.965
That's what this
is all about?

21:41.965 --> 21:44.724
You were offended
as a journalist?

21:45.241 --> 21:48.758
Twice the paper was
working on a story properly.

21:48.758 --> 21:51.758
With sources,
integrity, standards-

21:51.758 --> 21:52.620
only for
the Call Out-

21:52.620 --> 21:53.896
to blindly
post about it.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.275
So you were upset you
were getting scooped.

21:55.275 --> 21:56.689
Not just me.

21:56.689 --> 21:58.965
You should feel
the mood on campus.

21:58.965 --> 22:00.344
With all these accusations
flying around-

22:00.344 --> 22:01.965
everyone's been so
angry at each other.

22:03.448 --> 22:04.482
You must know
what I mean.

22:04.827 --> 22:07.448
Police and journalists
both want the truth.

22:07.448 --> 22:08.413
What Marisa
was doing was-

22:08.413 --> 22:10.034
Vigilantism?

22:12.793 --> 22:14.551
So how is what you
did any different?

22:14.655 --> 22:17.517
The graffiti in
Marisa's room?

22:17.517 --> 22:19.310
The stealing
of her laptop?

22:20.793 --> 22:21.724
When I found out-

22:21.724 --> 22:23.379
Marisa was behind
the Call Out-

22:23.379 --> 22:24.379
I just-

22:24.379 --> 22:26.344
It seemed irresponsible
not to do anything.

22:27.103 --> 22:28.517
I was going to shut
down the account.

22:29.137 --> 22:29.827
But it's still up.

22:29.827 --> 22:31.275
I couldn't crack
her password.

22:31.275 --> 22:33.000
So you cornered
her at the party?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.034
Hoping to take
it by force?

22:34.034 --> 22:35.310
Right?

22:35.310 --> 22:37.172
I didn't show up to the party
until after the police arrived.

22:38.586 --> 22:41.000
Okay I've got some people
who are going to confirm that.

22:44.241 --> 22:46.068
You know, here's the thing
I can't quite figure out.

22:47.344 --> 22:48.275
How did
you find out-

22:48.275 --> 22:49.931
that Marisa was behind
the Campus Call Out?

22:51.275 --> 22:52.379
I have my sources.

22:52.379 --> 22:53.620
You have your sources.

22:55.000 --> 22:55.862
The thing is-

22:55.862 --> 22:57.034
the list of people
who knew about that-

22:57.034 --> 22:59.310
begins and ends
with Camilla.

23:03.068 --> 23:04.000
It stung, didn't it?

23:05.517 --> 23:07.793
Camilla gets this
big internship.

23:07.793 --> 23:12.931
And then chooses to do a profile
on someone you simply despise.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.965
So maybe you just sneak a
peak at her phone on the sly.

23:20.482 --> 23:21.931
I think I
want a lawyer.

23:26.344 --> 23:27.655
I hate
to say it.

23:27.655 --> 23:28.896
Motive's there.

23:28.896 --> 23:30.413
It's just a matter of
proving opportunity.

23:30.413 --> 23:31.344
Just one problem.

23:31.344 --> 23:32.000
What's that?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.068
Frida's hands.

23:33.068 --> 23:35.413
The spray paint on them
does match the vandalism.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.241
But they're too small for
her to be our strangler.

23:37.827 --> 23:39.206
I wish I could say
I was relieved.

23:41.310 --> 23:42.689
Okay we need
to refocus.

23:43.103 --> 23:44.965
I want this
killer found.

23:52.551 --> 23:53.379
Hey.

23:55.896 --> 23:57.172
I uh-

23:57.172 --> 23:59.965
I just wanted to let you know
that Frida is being released.

24:00.793 --> 24:02.068
She did not
kill Marisa.

24:03.172 --> 24:05.965
Well we can strike murderer
off her winning traits.

24:06.758 --> 24:08.862
Liar, on the
other hand-

24:08.862 --> 24:09.896
Yeah.

24:09.896 --> 24:12.482
It must be tough to know
that Frida used you to-

24:13.586 --> 24:15.379
find who ran the
Campus Call Out.

24:15.379 --> 24:17.724
I knew Frida didn't
like The Call Out.

24:18.172 --> 24:19.620
I mean I didn't
either, at first.

24:20.965 --> 24:23.034
We bonded over
how trashy it got.

24:23.931 --> 24:25.448
And then what
changed your mind?

24:25.827 --> 24:28.482
When I began
writing the story-

24:28.482 --> 24:29.931
Marisa and
I got closer.

24:29.931 --> 24:33.827
I realized what she was
doing was important.

24:33.827 --> 24:35.517
And she does-

24:35.517 --> 24:36.896
she did have standards.

24:38.275 --> 24:42.000
And she just used social
instead of conventional media.

24:43.068 --> 24:43.931
When I was
in university-

24:43.931 --> 24:45.137
we could've used
someone like Marisa-

24:45.137 --> 24:47.310
to look out for
students like that.

24:47.413 --> 24:50.413
Yeah that's the part
that hurts the most.

24:51.206 --> 24:52.758
It's not that Frida
went behind my back.

24:52.758 --> 24:55.689
It's that she can't
see that in Marisa.

24:55.689 --> 24:58.413
She just wants to keep doing
things the same old way.

25:00.103 --> 25:02.344
Is anyone else going to
keep the Call Out going?

25:03.068 --> 25:04.379
Marisa worked alone.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.655
Everything she was
working on before she died-

25:08.655 --> 25:09.689
is just going to-

25:10.551 --> 25:11.586
vanish.

25:14.758 --> 25:16.000
Maybe that's the point.

25:18.448 --> 25:19.448
Sorry will you
excuse me?

25:19.448 --> 25:21.000
I should get
back up there.

25:31.655 --> 25:32.827
Ooh, what've
you got there?

25:32.827 --> 25:34.724
Oh you don't want to ruin
the surprise, now do you?

25:35.793 --> 25:36.517
What surprise?

25:40.137 --> 25:40.793
Uh, Jesse-

25:40.793 --> 25:42.827
you know, I
was thinking.

25:42.827 --> 25:46.862
What if this wasn't
about what Marisa posted-

25:46.862 --> 25:49.241
but what she
was going to post?

25:49.241 --> 25:52.275
Yeah, let me check
the Call Out's DM's.

26:04.103 --> 26:05.172
Yeah, you know-

26:05.172 --> 26:07.241
I'm not quite sure what
she was interested in here.

26:07.241 --> 26:08.862
I mean-

26:08.862 --> 26:09.827
the Campus Call Out-

26:09.827 --> 26:11.965
has been getting dozens
of messages a day.

26:11.965 --> 26:12.620
Yeah well-

26:12.620 --> 26:13.448
maybe the answer is-

26:13.448 --> 26:14.620
in here.

26:14.620 --> 26:16.482
This is everything that Frida
took from Marisa's room.

26:17.241 --> 26:20.620
Post-Humanism and CRISPR
Technology by Dr. Alan Vane.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.413
A paper on
gene editing?

26:22.413 --> 26:23.275
Wait a second.

26:23.275 --> 26:24.793
I thought Marisa
was a poli-sci major.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.379
Why does she have all
these biology papers?

26:26.379 --> 26:27.758
Well you know what?

26:27.758 --> 26:29.448
Maybe she wasn't
reading for a course.

26:29.448 --> 26:31.344
Dr. Alan Vane is
a tenured professor-

26:31.344 --> 26:32.689
at Heritage University.

26:32.689 --> 26:35.344
And Marisa had been sending
messages to his students.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.655
Here's one.

26:36.655 --> 26:37.758
Please consider-

26:37.758 --> 26:39.689
going on record
against Dr. Vane.

26:39.689 --> 26:41.275
I'm here if you
need a voice.

26:41.275 --> 26:43.517
I mean, there are at least
a half a dozen of these.

26:44.137 --> 26:45.344
What was she
looking for?

26:45.862 --> 26:47.137
Rex and I
will find out.

26:47.137 --> 26:49.206
We'll catch him on campus
first thing in the morning.

26:52.000 --> 26:52.689
What?

26:52.689 --> 26:53.655
What is it?

26:53.655 --> 26:55.000
The St. John's Tribune
just posted this.

27:02.586 --> 27:04.034
That's enough for today.

27:04.965 --> 27:06.827
I think I need to have
a talk with my daughter.

27:19.551 --> 27:20.482
Excuse me.

27:20.482 --> 27:21.965
Alan Vane?

27:21.965 --> 27:22.620
Doctor Vane.

27:22.620 --> 27:23.758
Yes, and you are?

27:24.448 --> 27:25.241
Detective-

27:25.241 --> 27:26.620
Charlie Hudson, SJPD.

27:26.620 --> 27:28.310
You mind if I ask you
a couple of questions?

27:28.310 --> 27:29.137
Well-

27:30.206 --> 27:30.862
Yes I suppose so-

27:30.862 --> 27:31.965
as long as
they're brief.

27:31.965 --> 27:33.586
I have a lecture to
deliver in fifteen minutes.

27:33.586 --> 27:35.344
Sure, I'll try
and make it quick.

27:35.344 --> 27:36.827
And no dogs allowed.

27:36.931 --> 27:38.103
He's working.

27:38.103 --> 27:39.000
Be that
as it may-

27:39.000 --> 27:40.689
this is a
sterile lab.

27:40.689 --> 27:42.551
For the sake of
ongoing experiments-

27:42.551 --> 27:43.241
I simply cannot-

27:43.241 --> 27:44.344
bend the rules.

27:45.206 --> 27:45.931
Okay.

27:46.517 --> 27:47.896
Sarah's rules apply, pal.

27:47.896 --> 27:49.000
Wait here.

27:58.275 --> 28:01.068
I'm sure you heard about
the death on campus.

28:01.068 --> 28:01.724
Yes.

28:01.724 --> 28:02.413
A tragedy.

28:03.896 --> 28:05.344
Did you know
Marisa Barnes?

28:05.344 --> 28:06.068
No no.

28:06.068 --> 28:07.103
She wasn't a
student of mine.

28:07.103 --> 28:09.413
Maybe you're more
familiar with her work?

28:09.413 --> 28:11.241
The Campus Call Out?

28:11.241 --> 28:12.551
Oh that was her?

28:12.551 --> 28:13.379
Uh-huh.

28:13.379 --> 28:14.620
Well in that case,
good riddance.

28:22.344 --> 28:24.068
A young woman
is dead, Doctor.

28:24.068 --> 28:25.827
Yes yes, I'm sorry.

28:25.827 --> 28:26.551
Of course.

28:26.551 --> 28:27.689
A terrible
loss I'm sure-

28:27.689 --> 28:29.620
for her friends
and her family.

28:29.620 --> 28:30.862
But the witch-
hunt mentality

28:30.862 --> 28:33.103
that she was spreading
around this campus was toxic.

28:33.103 --> 28:35.241
Now would you mind if
we walk to my lecture?

28:38.000 --> 28:38.655
Hey!

28:38.655 --> 28:39.758
No!

28:42.965 --> 28:44.620
That dog cannot
be in here.

28:44.620 --> 28:46.758
I'll get him out as soon
as I call my forensics team.

28:46.758 --> 28:48.000
I assume you
have a warrant?

28:48.000 --> 28:48.655
Yeah!

28:48.655 --> 28:49.586
Right here.

29:10.862 --> 29:12.758
Rex definitely
picked up the scent-

29:12.758 --> 29:13.896
of something
in Vane's lab.

29:13.896 --> 29:15.103
What can you tell
me about him?

29:15.103 --> 29:18.137
Well he is a controversial
figure on campus.

29:18.137 --> 29:19.413
Some of his papers
on gene editing-

29:19.413 --> 29:20.827
got him into
some hot water.

29:20.827 --> 29:23.344
Isn't that technology supposed
to cure cancer one day?

29:23.344 --> 29:25.206
As far as Dr.
Vane sees it-

29:25.206 --> 29:28.275
modify human genetics in
some ethically dicey ways.

29:28.275 --> 29:30.827
So how did he get on
Campus Call Out's radar?

29:30.827 --> 29:33.551
Well I spoke to some of
the people in Marisa DM's-

29:33.551 --> 29:36.379
who had Vane as their
PhD or Masters advisor.

29:36.379 --> 29:38.241
And not one of them
had gotten their degree.

29:39.034 --> 29:39.793
Okay.

29:39.793 --> 29:40.965
Dr. Vane claims

29:40.965 --> 29:42.827
that their proposals
weren't ready to defend.

29:42.827 --> 29:44.758
I mean they're stuck in
this endless revision loop.

29:44.758 --> 29:45.620
Can't move forward.

29:45.620 --> 29:47.448
So what- he's a
tough professor?

29:47.448 --> 29:48.620
Not on everyone.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.379
All those students
were people of colour.

29:50.379 --> 29:51.931
In fact, there was only
one student of colour-

29:51.931 --> 29:53.655
who ever graduated
under Vane's advisory.

29:53.655 --> 29:57.172
And that was going to be the
Campus Call Out's next article.

29:57.172 --> 29:59.793
Racism in the
Bio Department.

29:59.793 --> 30:02.275
Still doesn't put him
in the tunnel party-

30:02.275 --> 30:03.482
where Marisa was murdered.

30:03.482 --> 30:04.448
What if I
told you-

30:04.448 --> 30:05.827
that I found a service
tunnel access door-

30:05.827 --> 30:07.413
in the biology building-

30:07.413 --> 30:09.344
down the hall from
Dr. Vane's office?

30:13.241 --> 30:15.137
I'd say you're a
miracle worker Jesse.

30:15.896 --> 30:16.758
Nice work.

30:23.689 --> 30:24.517
Camilla!

30:24.793 --> 30:26.068
Hey listen!

30:26.517 --> 30:28.793
I do not appreciate you ducking
my phone calls last night.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.344
Okay, just don't
make a scene.

30:30.344 --> 30:31.034
Don't make a scene?

30:31.034 --> 30:32.275
So now you
know how I felt-

30:32.275 --> 30:33.482
when I was blindsided
by your article-

30:33.482 --> 30:34.517
in the middle
of my work!

30:34.517 --> 30:36.758
Publishing was
my editor's call.

30:36.758 --> 30:37.793
There is a reason-

30:37.793 --> 30:39.758
why cops and journalists
do not work together.

30:39.758 --> 30:40.965
It is a race
against time-

30:40.965 --> 30:42.206
to put together testimonies-

30:42.206 --> 30:43.551
and evidence-

30:43.551 --> 30:45.620
before public persuasion
skews the facts.

30:45.620 --> 30:47.000
You undid
all of that!

30:47.000 --> 30:50.275
Look if someone killed Marisa
because of Campus Call Out-

30:50.275 --> 30:52.103
people need to know the
good that she was doing.

30:53.275 --> 30:54.931
Look I read
your article.

30:54.931 --> 30:55.586
Okay?

30:55.586 --> 30:56.344
The writing-

30:57.793 --> 30:58.793
it was exceptional.

30:59.827 --> 31:01.241
All right?

31:01.344 --> 31:03.206
You almost
swayed me, even.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.000
What do you mean?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.517
I mean I know why Marisa
was doing what she was doing-

31:07.517 --> 31:09.000
even though I don't
agree with her methods.

31:09.000 --> 31:09.655
You don't?

31:09.655 --> 31:10.620
No!

31:10.620 --> 31:12.620
With all the evidence
that she gathered-

31:12.620 --> 31:14.206
she should have
brought it to a cop-

31:14.206 --> 31:16.000
or a good journalist
like you!

31:16.000 --> 31:17.862
What- so she
had it coming?

31:17.862 --> 31:18.517
No!

31:18.517 --> 31:19.413
That's not what-

31:19.413 --> 31:21.103
You sound
just like Frida.

31:21.103 --> 31:23.068
I'm trying to pay
you a compliment.

31:23.068 --> 31:26.482
What I'm trying
to say is that-

31:26.482 --> 31:28.068
I'm proud of you-

31:28.724 --> 31:30.413
in spite of all the headaches
that you've caused.

31:32.620 --> 31:34.275
And now that you've
been published-

31:34.275 --> 31:35.896
you're going to
leave this case alone.

31:36.827 --> 31:37.620
Right?

31:39.689 --> 31:40.344
Right.

31:41.758 --> 31:42.758
Okay, um-

31:42.758 --> 31:43.793
Listen, I've
got to go.

31:43.793 --> 31:44.689
I'll talk
to you later.

31:44.689 --> 31:45.379
Okay?

31:53.103 --> 31:53.793
Hey!

31:53.793 --> 31:55.586
Thanks for
meeting with me.

31:55.586 --> 31:57.068
Yeah I don't have
much time okay?

31:57.068 --> 31:58.655
I'm teaching a tutorial
in ten minutes.

31:58.655 --> 31:59.655
I'll be brief.

31:59.655 --> 32:01.793
I have access to the
Campus Call Out account.

32:01.896 --> 32:02.827
The dead girl?

32:02.827 --> 32:03.862
Right.

32:03.862 --> 32:05.482
You agreed to talk to
her before shed died-

32:05.482 --> 32:06.896
about Dr. Vane.

32:06.896 --> 32:08.068
But that never happened.

32:08.172 --> 32:10.931
Listen, I changed my
mind about that okay?

32:10.931 --> 32:12.275
I heard Dr.
Vane decided-

32:12.275 --> 32:14.896
your dissertation proposal
was ready to defend.

32:14.896 --> 32:16.310
Does that have
anything to do with your-

32:16.310 --> 32:18.448
sudden change of heart?

32:18.448 --> 32:19.344
I talked to
Vane myself.

32:19.344 --> 32:20.448
And he saw reason.

32:21.655 --> 32:23.137
So your work
moves forward.

32:23.137 --> 32:25.724
Dr. Vane gets your silence
on the racism allegations.

32:25.724 --> 32:26.724
Is that it?

32:26.827 --> 32:28.310
Is that what you
think this is about?

32:32.758 --> 32:34.000
Don't dig around
this anymore okay?

32:34.551 --> 32:35.758
I've got a good
thing going here.

32:35.758 --> 32:37.137
And I don't need
anyone to ruin that.

32:54.413 --> 32:55.793
Good, I wanted
you here for this.

32:55.793 --> 32:57.862
I thought I was going to
have to send Rex after you.

32:57.862 --> 33:00.379
I told you Detective that
you're wasting your time.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.655
I didn't have anything to do
with Marisa Barnes' death.

33:02.655 --> 33:04.379
Rex alerted to
something in this cabinet.

33:04.379 --> 33:06.655
Let's find out
what it is, shall we?

33:12.862 --> 33:13.517
Careful.

33:13.517 --> 33:14.551
Please.

33:14.551 --> 33:15.862
Some of those chemicals-
that you're manhandling

33:15.862 --> 33:17.103
happen to be
highly corrosive.

33:17.724 --> 33:18.482
Chloroform?

33:19.379 --> 33:20.689
Just like we found
on Marisa's neck?

33:20.689 --> 33:23.275
You think you've
proved something?

33:23.275 --> 33:25.172
Do you have any idea
how common chloroform is?

33:30.172 --> 33:31.103
What have
you got pal?

33:49.620 --> 33:51.103
You know, I think
I'm starting to see-

33:51.103 --> 33:52.310
what you had against
Campus Call Out.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.103
If I were you-

33:56.103 --> 33:58.965
I would cancel the rest
of your lectures for today-

33:58.965 --> 34:00.103
Dr. Vane.

34:11.379 --> 34:12.620
Looks like you
did know Marisa.

34:13.793 --> 34:15.551
That slander came
to me anonymously.

34:15.551 --> 34:17.206
I never met Marisa.

34:17.206 --> 34:18.724
Well we looked into
Marisa's claims.

34:18.724 --> 34:19.793
It seems like
it was true.

34:20.482 --> 34:22.379
Whenever you
were the advisor-

34:22.379 --> 34:24.793
your program became a bottleneck
for students of colour.

34:24.793 --> 34:26.862
It had nothing
to do with race.

34:26.862 --> 34:28.862
Science is a
rigorous discipline.

34:28.862 --> 34:32.448
And I accept proposals only that
meet the required standard.

34:32.448 --> 34:33.724
And what was
that standard?

34:34.655 --> 34:35.620
I mean some
of these-

34:35.620 --> 34:37.448
must have seemed interesting.

34:37.448 --> 34:38.586
Who is Ellen Harris?

34:38.586 --> 34:40.068
Um-

34:40.068 --> 34:42.379
a promising
PhD candidate.

34:42.379 --> 34:43.068
Uh-huh.

34:43.068 --> 34:43.724
Well-

34:43.724 --> 34:45.689
Marisa sent you these.

34:45.689 --> 34:48.586
This is Ellen's
dissertation proposal-

34:48.586 --> 34:49.655
from about
a year ago.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.620
And then this is
a paper of yours-

34:51.620 --> 34:53.965
that was published
several months later.

34:53.965 --> 34:56.310
Seems like she recognized-

34:56.310 --> 34:57.206
some shocking similarities-

34:57.206 --> 34:58.068
between the two.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.758
What exactly are
you insinuating?

35:01.758 --> 35:03.034
I'm not insinuating.

35:03.034 --> 35:06.034
Plagiarism is a great way to
cost yourself your reputation.

35:06.034 --> 35:07.034
And your tenure.

35:10.896 --> 35:12.172
You're clutching at straws.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.586
I think I've humoured
you quite long enough.

35:15.586 --> 35:17.758
I won't be saying anything
more until my lawyer arrives.

35:17.758 --> 35:20.137
But thank you very much for
the exciting story, Detective.

35:20.137 --> 35:20.965
Yeah.

35:20.965 --> 35:22.965
Well don't just
take my word for it.

35:22.965 --> 35:24.655
The journal that
published your article-

35:24.655 --> 35:25.931
they're looking
into it too.

35:25.931 --> 35:27.586
I'm sure they'll give
us a straight answer.

35:27.586 --> 35:28.310
Cheerio!

35:35.103 --> 35:36.000
Bad news.

35:36.517 --> 35:37.724
Vane's walking free.

35:37.862 --> 35:38.689
For now.

35:38.896 --> 35:39.896
What happened?

35:39.896 --> 35:41.965
Ah, his lawyer sprung
him with an alibi.

35:41.965 --> 35:44.448
Yeah, we don't have
enough to hold him.

35:44.448 --> 35:45.724
Guys.

35:45.724 --> 35:46.586
Campus Call Out's
posted again!

35:46.586 --> 35:47.275
Here.

35:47.275 --> 35:48.000
Come look at this.

35:55.103 --> 35:56.482
Dr. Vane arrested-

35:56.482 --> 35:57.758
on suspicion of
Marisa Barnes' murder.

35:57.758 --> 35:59.655
Yeah and the story
of Dr. Vane's plagiarism-

35:59.655 --> 36:01.034
broke alongside
it as well.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.206
Wait.

36:02.206 --> 36:03.275
Who's taken over
the account?

36:03.275 --> 36:05.551
Did Frida lie about not
getting Marisa's password?

36:06.655 --> 36:07.586
It's Camilla.

36:07.896 --> 36:08.517
Joe.

36:08.517 --> 36:09.827
Are you sure?

36:09.827 --> 36:10.862
She's the only one-

36:10.862 --> 36:12.379
who would've had access
to change the password.

36:13.517 --> 36:14.931
We just released Vane.

36:14.931 --> 36:15.965
If he's the killer-

36:15.965 --> 36:17.931
he's not going like that
someone published this.

36:17.931 --> 36:20.000
The Call Out's
messages are active.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.517
She's messaging someone.

36:21.517 --> 36:22.206
Here.

36:22.206 --> 36:22.931
You're close.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.068
I have all the
proof you need-

36:24.068 --> 36:25.344
to put Dr. Vane
away for good.

36:25.344 --> 36:28.034
Meet me where
she was killed ASAP.

36:28.034 --> 36:29.344
She's going to
get herself killed.

36:30.206 --> 36:31.103
We need
to find her.

36:32.172 --> 36:33.137
Now.

36:33.137 --> 36:33.965
Rex.

37:02.551 --> 37:03.551
Hello?

37:09.000 --> 37:09.655
Camilla?

37:11.137 --> 37:12.724
Grant, what are
you doing here?

37:12.724 --> 37:15.655
You're the one continuing
the Call Out page?

37:15.655 --> 37:16.344
That's-

37:16.862 --> 37:17.862
that's great.

37:18.344 --> 37:20.965
You said you had
info on Dr. Vane?

37:20.965 --> 37:21.931
Yeah yeah.

37:21.931 --> 37:22.655
Absolutely.

37:24.551 --> 37:26.586
I have some friends
in his program.

37:26.586 --> 37:29.344
Someone said they saw
him here that night.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.413
Great!

37:31.413 --> 37:33.689
You can set me up
with their contact info.

37:34.379 --> 37:35.000
Yeah of course.

37:35.000 --> 37:35.689
I just-

37:37.413 --> 37:40.000
I need you to do
something for me first.

37:44.482 --> 37:45.310
Help me out
here, Jesse.

37:45.310 --> 37:46.034
Where am I going?

37:47.655 --> 37:48.655
Okay, Charlie.

37:48.655 --> 37:49.620
The nearest access-

37:49.620 --> 37:51.448
tunnel door should be
just ahead of you.

37:53.482 --> 37:54.344
Yeah I see it.

37:54.344 --> 37:55.206
Thanks.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.137
Something
like anonymity?

37:56.137 --> 37:58.000
Charlie, Camilla's
livestreaming-

37:58.000 --> 37:58.724
right now.

37:58.724 --> 37:59.689
I'm sending
you the link.

38:00.965 --> 38:02.241
I just
need a favour-

38:02.241 --> 38:03.379
since I'm bringing
you this info.

38:03.379 --> 38:04.137
Don't mess around.

38:04.137 --> 38:05.413
Do you have
this info or not?

38:05.413 --> 38:06.103
Yeah.

38:06.103 --> 38:07.034
No, trust me,
I just-

38:08.206 --> 38:08.965
I think that's Grant.

38:08.965 --> 38:10.172
The DJ janitor guy?

38:10.172 --> 38:11.586
Yeah, that would
explain the chloroform.

38:12.241 --> 38:13.241
Cleaning supplies.

38:13.241 --> 38:14.448
That's not
really how it works Grant.

38:17.172 --> 38:17.896
I've got to go.

38:18.862 --> 38:19.413
I mean you're
running the account.

38:20.758 --> 38:22.448
It can work
however you want.

38:22.448 --> 38:25.379
I just need you to take
down that post about me.

38:26.103 --> 38:28.103
I'm not going
to do that, Grant.

38:28.103 --> 38:29.931
Camilla, be reasonable.

38:30.724 --> 38:32.241
The punishment has to
match the crime, right?

38:32.241 --> 38:33.793
Look as long as that
post is out there-

38:33.793 --> 38:35.413
every time you
search my name-

38:35.413 --> 38:37.172
The Call Out is the
first thing to come up!

38:39.862 --> 38:41.655
I had bigger dreams than
being a janitor you know?

38:43.000 --> 38:44.655
Look how long am I
supposed to pay?

38:45.862 --> 38:46.758
You know better
than anyone-

38:46.758 --> 38:48.206
I have changed.

38:49.103 --> 38:50.241
But you haven't.

38:50.241 --> 38:51.241
Come on Camilla!

38:52.620 --> 38:53.724
Of course I have!

38:54.689 --> 38:58.413
Grant, I told you to meet me
where Marisa was killed.

38:58.413 --> 38:59.620
How'd you know
where to find me?

39:00.241 --> 39:01.103
There were uh-

39:02.310 --> 39:03.310
There were a
lot of people-

39:03.310 --> 39:04.206
at that party.

39:05.896 --> 39:07.413
Somebody told me or-

39:07.413 --> 39:08.793
I mean, it was in
your article right?

39:08.793 --> 39:11.241
You didn't wander
the tunnels.

39:11.241 --> 39:12.655
You didn't call
out my name.

39:13.655 --> 39:14.448
You came here.

39:15.275 --> 39:16.172
Right away.

39:22.034 --> 39:22.862
Ughh!

39:26.000 --> 39:26.689
Come on.

39:29.862 --> 39:30.620
You okay?

39:30.620 --> 39:31.448
Yes.

39:31.448 --> 39:32.310
Took you long enough.

39:32.310 --> 39:33.689
Well I could have
used a head's up.

39:35.172 --> 39:36.034
But I did hear everything.

39:36.034 --> 39:36.931
It's not true!

39:38.172 --> 39:40.000
Well I do believe that you
didn't come here to kill Marisa.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.206
Not at first.

39:41.206 --> 39:42.758
But then she refused
to take the post down.

39:42.758 --> 39:43.931
And you lost
your temper.

39:44.689 --> 39:45.344
I just-

39:45.344 --> 39:47.931
I moved to
grab her phone.

39:47.931 --> 39:49.344
She pulled back
but hit her head and-

39:50.379 --> 39:52.103
my whole life flashed
before my eyes.

39:52.103 --> 39:53.655
A new Call Out
post about me.

39:53.655 --> 39:55.620
So you reacted
on instinct.

39:55.620 --> 39:56.448
Ugh!

39:56.448 --> 39:57.620
You really haven't
changed at all.

39:57.620 --> 39:58.620
Come on.

40:00.379 --> 40:01.896
I didn't mean
for her to die.

40:03.344 --> 40:05.689
Well you don't need to worry
about life after college, Grant.

40:05.793 --> 40:06.758
You're going
to be in jail.

40:06.758 --> 40:07.586
Let's go.

40:31.724 --> 40:32.379
Hey.

40:32.931 --> 40:33.896
Hey!

40:36.517 --> 40:37.482
Listen!

40:37.482 --> 40:39.034
That was such
a risky move!

40:39.724 --> 40:40.620
What were
you thinking?

40:40.793 --> 40:42.310
I had to do what I
thought was right.

40:42.310 --> 40:44.310
Putting yourself out
as bait for a killer?

40:44.310 --> 40:46.275
Making sure Marisa's
work was finished.

40:48.103 --> 40:48.793
I have to admit-

40:48.793 --> 40:50.103
that was-

40:50.103 --> 40:51.068
that was good
detective work.

40:51.931 --> 40:52.689
You know?

40:52.689 --> 40:54.137
Hunting down
the leads on Vane.

40:54.137 --> 40:56.862
Yeah, I've got DMs flooding
in with people claiming-

40:56.862 --> 40:58.206
Vane stole their
research too.

40:58.206 --> 41:01.000
Yeah well I just wish you waited
until the case was closed.

41:01.965 --> 41:03.551
We're after the
same thing, Dad.

41:03.551 --> 41:04.931
Just in different ways.

41:06.310 --> 41:08.413
Well I guess we're going to
have to find ways to coexist-

41:08.413 --> 41:11.379
if this is your chosen
career path, huh?

41:12.103 --> 41:13.827
I've got an affinity
for the crime beat.

41:13.827 --> 41:14.724
Don't you think?

41:15.482 --> 41:16.344
Hey, let
me through!

41:16.344 --> 41:17.586
That's my
girlfriend in there.

41:21.034 --> 41:21.758
Go.

41:22.724 --> 41:24.965
Go on, go
talk to her.

41:24.965 --> 41:25.862
If things work out-

41:25.862 --> 41:27.068
maybe we can have
her over for dinner.

41:28.241 --> 41:29.275
We'll see about that.

41:34.241 --> 41:34.896
Hey!

41:34.896 --> 41:35.758
Hi.

41:36.551 --> 41:37.241
Come on.

41:37.241 --> 41:39.689
Um-
I'm so sorry.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.034
I know this
looks bad.

41:41.034 --> 41:44.482
I just didn't
know what to do.

41:56.172 --> 41:57.000
Hey!

41:59.103 --> 42:00.000
Hey, pal.

42:00.862 --> 42:01.965
Is it just me?

42:01.965 --> 42:03.482
Or has everyone been acting
really weird this week?

42:06.655 --> 42:07.310
What?

42:07.793 --> 42:09.068
You want me to
come with you?

42:09.344 --> 42:10.586
Okay I'll come
with you.

42:22.620 --> 42:23.448
Surprise!

42:28.862 --> 42:29.482
What?

42:29.482 --> 42:30.206
Guys!

42:32.793 --> 42:33.931
Hey!

42:33.931 --> 42:35.620
Did you really think we'd
forget your 30th birthday?

42:35.620 --> 42:36.379
No!

42:36.379 --> 42:37.172
I mean, no not-

42:37.172 --> 42:38.310
Maybe just
a little bit.

42:38.310 --> 42:39.689
Well we didn't want
to ruin the surprise.

42:39.689 --> 42:40.413
Happy Birthday, pal.

42:40.413 --> 42:41.137
Thank you, thank you.

42:41.137 --> 42:41.931
You know-

42:41.931 --> 42:43.000
you guys don't
even want to know-

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
what I thought
was going on.

42:45.000 --> 42:45.931
What do you mean?

42:45.931 --> 42:47.103
Well I thought that
you and Sarah were-

42:47.758 --> 42:48.896
Were what?

42:48.896 --> 42:50.275
Oh nothing, it's crazy.

42:50.275 --> 42:51.310
Is this vanilla cake?

42:51.310 --> 42:52.413
It's
your favourite!

42:52.413 --> 42:53.068
Thank you!

42:53.068 --> 42:53.896
Mm-hmm!

42:53.896 --> 42:55.482
Guys, how
did you know?

42:59.275 --> 43:00.275
There you go.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.965
Hey you played
that off really well.
