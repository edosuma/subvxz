WEBVTT

00:03.463 --> 00:07.801
The risotto isn't bad, but it's not
what Chef Zane did back at Fortunato.

00:07.926 --> 00:10.095
He replaced the rosemary
with saffron, for one thing.

00:10.220 --> 00:12.681
And what is this stock?
Did he get it out of a can?

00:14.099 --> 00:16.142
My fish isn't bad.

00:16.267 --> 00:20.105
But it's not great either, I'm sure.
I warned you against the snapper.

00:27.654 --> 00:29.322
Do you think
it'll calm down?

00:29.447 --> 00:30.949
God. I hope so.

00:32.784 --> 00:35.245
That guy is a bit of a blowhard,
though, isn't he?

00:35.370 --> 00:37.622
The food's not spicy at all,
you can barely taste it.

00:37.747 --> 00:40.667
Mine's pretty spicy. Try it.

00:42.752 --> 00:44.963
I don't taste anything.

00:45.088 --> 00:47.298
Have you been throwing
rolls at me?

00:47.424 --> 00:48.383
(CLEARING THROAT)

00:49.467 --> 00:50.593
It wasn't me.

00:50.885 --> 00:53.430
Really, he didn't.

00:53.555 --> 00:57.016
I'm sorry someone would choose
to behave that way. Really, I...

00:59.060 --> 01:02.272
I'm so sorry.
Really, really, really sorry.

01:02.397 --> 01:04.733
No, no, no, no.
I swear, I...

01:06.025 --> 01:07.652
It's not me.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.750
A bloody tear could just mean
subconjunctival hemorrhage.

02:45.875 --> 02:48.920
He sneezed too hard from a cold,
which caused his lack of taste.

02:49.045 --> 02:50.755
House isn't going to care.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.716
Does "black tie optional"
really mean black tie,

02:53.842 --> 02:54.801
'cause I don't want to rent if...

02:54.926 --> 02:56.302
There's been a glitch
with the wedding.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.263
And House will
be interested.

02:58.388 --> 02:59.347
A "glitch"?

02:59.472 --> 03:01.474
Patient had his
corpus callosum cut

03:01.599 --> 03:02.725
to correct a seizure issue.

03:02.851 --> 03:03.685
A "glitch"?

03:03.810 --> 03:05.270
The seizures stopped
after the surgery.

03:05.395 --> 03:06.980
But he's having trouble
adjusting to a split brain.

03:07.272 --> 03:09.190
A "glitch"?

03:09.315 --> 03:12.777
This is Dr. Taub.
Tell him about shopping.

03:13.862 --> 03:16.739
I go into a grocery store,
everything seems normal.

03:16.865 --> 03:20.493
I get to the checkout, and there's
all these extra items in my cart.

03:20.618 --> 03:23.204
Stuff I didn't put there.
Stuff I hate.

03:23.329 --> 03:25.206
My left hand hates me.

03:28.001 --> 03:30.587
Yeah. I think House'll
be interested.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.882
(HOUSE HUMMING)

03:39.178 --> 03:41.764
Just warning you.
I'm in a good mood

03:41.890 --> 03:44.767
and largely pain-free, so I've got
no idea how things are...

03:44.893 --> 03:47.020
Alien hand syndrome.

03:47.854 --> 03:50.815
Set off by a stroke, or is
there a pony in the backyard?

03:50.940 --> 03:54.360
Split brain. Right hemisphere
controls the left, and...

03:54.485 --> 03:57.989
It's making life miserable.
Non-logical thinkers often do.

03:58.114 --> 04:00.575
The current issue isn't the split brain.
The surgery corrected...

04:00.700 --> 04:01.868
You're dissing
the right hemisphere?

04:01.993 --> 04:03.077
Most people who have this operation

04:03.202 --> 04:04.662
don't even notice
they're missing anything.

04:04.787 --> 04:06.998
The left brain has language,
arithmetic, rationality,

04:07.123 --> 04:08.458
and right brain
is a mute loser.

04:08.583 --> 04:10.335
The right brain
is more aesthetically oriented,

04:10.460 --> 04:11.878
has greater facial recognition.

04:12.003 --> 04:13.212
I couldn't have been a
plastic surgeon without it.

04:13.338 --> 04:15.423
Yes, and where
would junior high be

04:15.548 --> 04:17.342
without our ability to judge
people on aesthetics?

04:17.467 --> 04:19.385
Right brain's also more aware
of the present moment,

04:19.510 --> 04:20.970
our place in the universe.

04:21.095 --> 04:25.391
It's a universal daisy chain of peace
and love that throws buns at people.

04:25.516 --> 04:28.353
THIRTEEN: His present symptoms
could mean autoimmune disease,

04:28.478 --> 04:31.564
a nasolacrimal tumor,
an infection or just a cold.

04:31.689 --> 04:36.235
Good morning, sunshine. We got a brand
new toy, you want to play?

04:36.361 --> 04:37.612
We need to talk.

04:38.613 --> 04:41.282
Great. I love euphemisms.

04:41.407 --> 04:44.452
By "euphemism," I mean when you say
something but mean something else.

04:44.577 --> 04:46.788
Begin eliminating.
Search the home.

04:53.086 --> 04:56.589
Isn't that like locking the barn door
after the horse has put his face

04:56.714 --> 04:58.758
between your breasts
for an hour and a half?

04:59.425 --> 05:02.512
I'm your boss.
You're an employee.

05:03.471 --> 05:06.391
I'm not normally into role-playing,
but if you want to...

05:07.558 --> 05:10.770
People who get close
to you get hurt. That's a fact.

05:11.688 --> 05:15.525
You're also a valued doctor
in this hospital. That's another fact.

05:15.650 --> 05:18.194
From now on,
we're going to focus on the second fact.

05:19.112 --> 05:21.990
So, this isn't you freaking
out over last night?

05:22.115 --> 05:26.828
This isn't an emotional decision.
I'm just giving you the rules.

05:26.953 --> 05:28.746
You can either
accept them or leave.

05:51.102 --> 05:52.854
I slept with Cuddy.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.690
After she helped me
detox from Vicodin.

05:55.815 --> 05:58.693
I've been clean for
almost 24 hours now.

06:02.822 --> 06:05.199
Okay.
Thought I'd mention it.

06:06.451 --> 06:07.702
Wow.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.454
Wow.

06:10.246 --> 06:11.247
One for each.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.790
That's what she said. Ah!

06:12.915 --> 06:14.167
How's the pain?

06:14.292 --> 06:15.626
She's probably
got some bruising.

06:15.752 --> 06:19.505
Yeah, I get it, you're a stud.
This is serious, House.

06:20.798 --> 06:22.800
I feel better than I
did four hours ago.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.719
Four hours from now,
I'll feel better than this.

06:24.844 --> 06:27.805
The other "wow."
You were sober? She was sober?

06:27.930 --> 06:30.683
Clean and sober and hot.

06:31.100 --> 06:35.063
Wow. This is fantastic.
How are you gonna screw it up?

06:35.188 --> 06:37.440
Several good options.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.525
Unfortunately, I don't
think she's gonna give me the pleasure.

06:39.650 --> 06:40.735
She left before I woke up

06:40.860 --> 06:43.696
and five minutes ago, she told me
that I'm just an employee.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.448
- Ha.
- Yes.

06:45.573 --> 06:49.660
Well, either she's
actually in love with you and scared,

06:49.786 --> 06:53.289
or she realized last night
was a gigantic mistake.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.666
You were needy and vulnerable,
she was maternal.

06:55.792 --> 06:56.876
You think she
jumped me out of pity?

06:57.001 --> 07:03.007
No, I'm saying whatever is going on,
you need to talk to her.

07:03.132 --> 07:04.759
Absolutely.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.388
Does our patient
freak you out a little?

07:09.514 --> 07:10.598
TAUB: No.

07:11.557 --> 07:15.686
If he's two people, then we're all two
people and we just don't know it.

07:15.812 --> 07:17.730
And what does that
say about identity?

07:17.855 --> 07:22.693
It says we're making it up as we
go along, which I find freeing.

07:23.319 --> 07:27.532
Wow, I haven't been in a bathroom
this size since my dorm in med school.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.451
Is that fungus?

07:30.576 --> 07:32.036
It's from the steam buildup.

07:36.332 --> 07:39.585
What do you think of this "glitch"
with Chase and Cameron's wedding?

07:39.710 --> 07:42.797
It's always a sad thing when
sperm comes between people.

07:46.050 --> 07:48.219
I hear the sperm
is very good today.

07:48.344 --> 07:50.054
I mean, the salmon.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.853
- Go away.
- No other tables.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.109
You'd let your wife
keep another man's offspring on ice

08:03.234 --> 08:06.279
next to the frozen peas,
just in case?

08:06.404 --> 08:07.947
That's what this is about.

08:08.072 --> 08:11.701
She's not ready to commit to me.
She's planning for failure.

08:11.826 --> 08:15.663
Did you know that male fruit flies have
toxic chemicals in their seminal fluid

08:15.788 --> 08:17.957
that inhibit the sperm
of other males?

08:27.508 --> 08:30.136
Wilson says we need to talk.

08:30.261 --> 08:31.762
- We talked.
- I agree.

08:34.098 --> 08:36.934
This has clearly gone
past the talking stage.

08:39.770 --> 08:40.855
What?

08:44.483 --> 08:48.404
Hey.
Great, did you find my MP3?

08:48.529 --> 08:53.910
Not yet. But I got your shaving stuff,
toothpaste, deodorant,

08:54.035 --> 08:58.080
some magazines,
and this cactus from your window.

08:58.206 --> 09:02.001
You didn't have to do that. Really,
the hospital supplies all that stuff.

09:02.126 --> 09:05.087
I'm still trying too hard, huh? Trying
to get your other half to like me.

09:05.213 --> 09:09.926
No, no, no. Don't say that,
okay? I like you, which means that...

09:12.970 --> 09:14.096
We shouldn't
read into that.

09:14.222 --> 09:15.848
THIRTEEN: Anti-fungal meds.

09:17.058 --> 09:18.684
Ordinarily we'd put
them in your IV,

09:18.809 --> 09:21.854
but since your right
brain doesn't seem too fond of IVs...

09:21.979 --> 09:23.522
You should be feeling
better in a few days.

09:23.648 --> 09:24.941
I have to get back to work.

09:25.066 --> 09:28.069
Rick says your shift will be waiting
for you when you get back.

09:28.194 --> 09:29.487
Thanks.

09:30.196 --> 09:34.700
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

09:35.868 --> 09:37.036
I'm sorry.

09:37.161 --> 09:38.829
I have to go.
I have to get back to work.

09:38.955 --> 09:41.832
Babe, wait. Hold on.
No, no. It wasn't me...

09:44.043 --> 09:45.461
I can't walk.

09:48.923 --> 09:50.758
TAUB: Well, obviously
it wasn't the fungus.

09:50.883 --> 09:54.053
And it's not a coordination issue.
Dehydration can cause loss of balance.

09:54.178 --> 09:55.012
We haven't had him on IV.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.890
No. Good skin turgor,
not orthostatic.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.643
Could be our tax
dollars at work,

10:00.768 --> 10:03.980
constantly building new
roadways and bridges.

10:04.105 --> 10:05.898
Meningioma. Slow-growing.

10:06.023 --> 10:08.859
It could extend along the sub-osteal
layer of the cranial cavity,

10:08.985 --> 10:10.069
and be hidden by the bone.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.363
The cancer cells are actually
re-growing a connection

10:12.488 --> 10:14.073
between the left
and right hemispheres.

10:14.198 --> 10:16.909
If you're right, the two halves
have begun sending messages again,

10:17.034 --> 10:19.161
but it's too early in the process
for him to pick up on it.

10:19.287 --> 10:21.497
But we can test for it.

10:25.751 --> 10:27.086
HOUSE: Proof.

10:30.089 --> 10:32.300
You didn't talk
to her, did you?

10:32.425 --> 10:34.927
If I'd talked, she'd have lied,
I'd have lied,

10:35.052 --> 10:36.887
and though two negatives
make a positive,

10:37.013 --> 10:39.765
I thought thermal-imaging
photos seemed simpler.

10:39.890 --> 10:43.060
Note how many more heated areas appear
after less than a minute with me.

10:43.185 --> 10:46.063
So it's either love,
or possibly rage.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.523
Don't talk to her.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.066
I have no plans
to talk to her.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.985
Manipulation is in
your genetic code.

10:51.110 --> 10:52.987
You think I'm making a mistake,
you move in to correct.

10:53.112 --> 10:55.406
- You are making a mistake.
- She lied to me.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.908
Either last night or today.
I need to find out which and why.

10:58.034 --> 11:00.578
And clearly, thermal
imaging is the way.

11:00.703 --> 11:03.039
This isn't a case. You're not
looking for a diagnosis.

11:03.164 --> 11:08.085
If this matters at all to you, please,
for once in your life, be an adult.

11:11.589 --> 11:13.674
FOREMAN: Keep your eyes
focused on the plus sign.

11:13.799 --> 11:14.717
Any image that appears

11:14.842 --> 11:17.219
on your far right will
only be seen by your left brain,

11:17.345 --> 11:21.515
and any image on your far left will
only be seen by your right brain.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.475
Okay-

11:22.600 --> 11:24.060
Just start by
saying the words.

11:25.227 --> 11:31.776
Book, giraffe,
willow, fortunate.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.658
You're not saying the word.

11:39.784 --> 11:41.202
I didn't see a word.

11:43.621 --> 11:46.791
Could you draw a picture
of what you think the word might be?

11:46.916 --> 11:49.377
Look, I didn't see...

11:54.799 --> 11:56.092
Candle.

11:57.385 --> 11:58.386
This is so cool.

11:58.511 --> 12:00.262
Yeah, that's not
freaky at all.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.848
No communication.

12:03.599 --> 12:04.850
So far.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.487
Scott, why are you standing?

12:19.949 --> 12:20.950
I'm a little chilly.

12:21.075 --> 12:22.618
I thought I'd get a sweater
or something from my room.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.744
Is that okay?

12:23.869 --> 12:24.912
Just a few more minutes.

12:26.288 --> 12:30.918
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is the left hemisphere.

12:31.043 --> 12:33.754
The side that's obsessed
with finding answers,

12:33.879 --> 12:35.840
the one that needs
things to make sense, the interpreter.

12:35.965 --> 12:38.926
That's where we tell the story
of who we are and why we do things.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.719
That's also the side
that was wrong.

12:40.845 --> 12:42.805
The right brain's advantage
is that it isn't logical,

12:42.930 --> 12:44.890
it doesn't choose which
details to look at.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.892
It makes connections
you could never see.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.770
You owe your
insight to the "mute loser."

12:49.895 --> 12:51.772
I'll send it tickets
to a Phillies game.

12:51.897 --> 12:55.734
Confabulation means no communication.
Means your theory's wrong.

12:59.822 --> 13:00.948
But he is cold.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.042
Why are you scratching?

13:12.168 --> 13:13.335
It itches.

13:13.461 --> 13:14.920
Ammonia breath.

13:23.429 --> 13:25.264
Your liver is failing.

13:26.891 --> 13:28.350
I know for them to approve
this price,

13:28.476 --> 13:31.312
they'll need
statistical documentation...

13:31.437 --> 13:33.314
What? Why are you
looking at me?

13:33.439 --> 13:35.774
When you first walked in,
I was under the impression

13:35.900 --> 13:38.819
you wanted to
say something else.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.947
- Nope.
- About House and me.

13:42.907 --> 13:44.909
There's nothing
to talk about.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.952
(DOOR OPENING)

13:50.915 --> 13:52.917
I want permission
to do a liver biopsy.

13:53.042 --> 13:54.960
We're looking
for sarcoidosis.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.337
Fine.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.005
What do you mean, "Fine"?

13:58.130 --> 13:59.381
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

13:59.507 --> 14:02.593
Do you mean that because
a liver biopsy is not a test

14:02.718 --> 14:05.346
that by any stretch of the imagination
could be considered risky,

14:05.471 --> 14:07.765
so asking my permission is
essentially wasting my time,

14:07.890 --> 14:10.809
and you're wondering
what my reaction to that will be?

14:10.935 --> 14:11.977
Yes.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.187
Are you trying
to make me angry?

14:13.312 --> 14:14.146
Yes.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.482
Do your biopsy. And also,
do your clinic hours.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.025
I'm blowing off
my clinic hours.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.193
Really?

14:19.318 --> 14:20.986
Let's see how that goes.

14:23.948 --> 14:26.951
Still not angry.
Try again later.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.213
(EXHALING)

14:39.338 --> 14:41.590
Sorry. I know
I'm a little ripe.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.717
- Just a sweaty guy.
- Recently?

14:43.842 --> 14:44.885
Always.

14:46.554 --> 14:50.766
With a crazy left hand. Sometimes I
fantasize about cutting it off.

14:51.350 --> 14:54.603
Just a fantasy.
It's the hand that's crazy, not me.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.025
What?

15:00.150 --> 15:03.445
If it doesn't like an ultrasound wand,
how's it gonna react to a needle?

15:05.155 --> 15:07.032
Can you get music
into this room?

15:07.950 --> 15:11.787
I think you're using your relationship
with Cuddy as a replacement for drugs.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.998
You should be in more pain
so soon into detoxing,

15:14.123 --> 15:16.542
but your body's full
of romantic endorphins,

15:16.667 --> 15:21.338
and on top of that, you create
this distraction of looking for proof.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.799
You think I should stop
and let the pain flood back?

15:23.924 --> 15:25.593
Cuddy is not
a Vicodin substitute.

15:25.718 --> 15:26.719
Quite the opposite.

15:26.844 --> 15:29.805
You have to wait
for her to be ready.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.808
Great advice. You pretend that
I'm going to do that.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.185
You've made two major
changes in your life,

15:35.311 --> 15:37.187
not a time anyone's
judgment is at its best.

15:37.313 --> 15:40.816
Didn't you used to argue that my
judgment would be better off drugs?

15:40.941 --> 15:43.569
Admit it. You're curious
why I want to make her angry.

15:43.694 --> 15:46.238
I'm sure it's convoluted,
wrong and stupid.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.490
You're dying to know
what I found on her coffee cup.

15:48.616 --> 15:50.701
- No, because...
- Oxytocin.

15:57.166 --> 16:01.253
Oxytocin, the chemical
involved in emotional bonding.

16:01.378 --> 16:05.466
Her lips say "no," her hormones say
"Oh, my God, yes, more."

16:05.591 --> 16:07.885
No. For you to know
her levels were elevated,

16:08.010 --> 16:09.637
you'd need a baseline
to compare them with.

16:09.762 --> 16:13.849
I paid the guy in the gym to retrieve
one of her water bottles from the trash.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.518
Love inspires
us to greatness.

16:16.644 --> 16:18.812
So I need to make
her lose her temper,

16:18.937 --> 16:21.315
which breaks her delusion,
which demonstrates to me, and to her,

16:21.440 --> 16:23.525
that there is something
underneath this facade.

16:23.651 --> 16:24.693
And then what happens?

16:24.818 --> 16:26.737
She admits everything
and falls into your arms?

16:26.862 --> 16:30.616
That's outcome one.
Outcome two is she kills me.

16:30.741 --> 16:33.118
I think it's
50-50 right now.

16:34.662 --> 16:35.746
Great.

16:35.871 --> 16:37.331
I thought you'd say that.

16:37.456 --> 16:40.709
You're committing
yourself to something. To someone.

16:40.834 --> 16:45.089
I mean, it's childish in
a way, but ultimately great.

16:45.964 --> 16:49.927
Assuming... Are you absolutely sure
you want this to succeed?

16:50.636 --> 16:53.931
Why is an old guy
standing in my doorway?

16:54.056 --> 16:55.766
Eugene Schwartz.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.519
Eugene Schwartz.

16:58.644 --> 17:01.355
Dr. Cuddy asked me to come
up here from the clinic.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.650
She says you're seeing
patients in your office.

17:04.775 --> 17:07.236
It's still free,
though, isn't it?

17:07.361 --> 17:09.405
She sent him.
That's gotta mean something.

17:09.530 --> 17:11.573
I'll go get my decoder ring.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.663
I squawk. Like a parrot.

17:19.665 --> 17:20.666
(SQUAWKING)

17:21.083 --> 17:23.711
No, that's not it.
It started a few months ago.

17:23.836 --> 17:27.589
I was doing some woodworking in my
garage. I was trying to make a chair.

17:28.632 --> 17:30.259
Was it the chair?

17:30.384 --> 17:32.720
Anyway, all of a sudden,
from nowhere,

17:32.845 --> 17:35.764
this strange noise
comes bursting out of my mouth.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.183
(SQUAWKING)

17:40.269 --> 17:41.812
Tough to fake that.

17:41.937 --> 17:43.439
Nice pants.

17:44.982 --> 17:49.695
My wife Mona thinks I'm busting
her chops. It's ruining my marriage.

17:49.820 --> 17:50.654
Where are we going?

17:50.779 --> 17:51.780
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

17:51.905 --> 17:56.201
So your left hand would rather play air
guitar than give me a hard time?

17:56.326 --> 17:59.621
It'd rather play air guitar
than tie shoes, eat dinner...

17:59.747 --> 18:01.874
Your right hand's
playing, too.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.751
I don't want to
discourage it.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.635
Splinter hemorrhages
under his fingernails.

18:13.761 --> 18:14.970
What's that...

18:18.390 --> 18:19.808
TAUB: BP and O2 sat
are dropping.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.727
We need a bag
of B-negative in here!

18:22.144 --> 18:24.772
So much for sarcoidosis.

18:24.897 --> 18:27.816
Points to a clotting issue.
Clots would explain all his symptoms.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.818
Why aren't we
in the office?

18:29.943 --> 18:31.653
I'm tired of clinic duty.

18:31.779 --> 18:35.032
There's only one thing
that could cause squawking, right?

18:35.157 --> 18:36.241
Yeah.

18:36.366 --> 18:37.868
We gave him heparin
and did an echo of his heart

18:37.993 --> 18:39.286
to see if it was
throwing clots, but...

18:39.411 --> 18:40.579
More air guitar?

18:40.704 --> 18:41.789
The heart's fine.

18:41.914 --> 18:45.000
We wanted to test for Factor V Leiden,
Protein C, Protein S,

18:45.125 --> 18:48.670
but the hand got tired of cooperating.
We finally knocked him out.

18:48.796 --> 18:50.255
And all those tests came
up negative anyway,

18:50.380 --> 18:52.883
or you'd have opened by telling me
your brilliant diagnosis.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.593
He apologized
for being sweaty,

18:54.718 --> 18:57.221
said it had always been an issue.
But what if it's a symptom?

18:57.346 --> 19:01.225
There are cancers that cause night
sweats and can lead to clots. Lymphoma.

19:01.350 --> 19:03.310
Or pancreatic cancer.

19:04.478 --> 19:06.188
Go scan his pancreas.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.193
And try Led Zeppelin.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.196
We've always remembered
what this hospital did for Leo

19:14.321 --> 19:15.948
when his appendix burst.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.492
Still, a check this size...

19:19.117 --> 19:22.287
Sorry to interrupt,
here's my poo.

19:22.913 --> 19:26.416
Dr. House said to bring it over and
leave it with you as soon as I could.

19:26.542 --> 19:29.503
I don't know if you people
have an official term for it.

19:29.628 --> 19:31.296
- Stool sample.
- Ah, yes.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.714
Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

19:32.840 --> 19:37.135
It's hard to rush these things. Even if
you've eaten a lot of broccoli.

19:41.515 --> 19:42.516
Where are you going?

19:42.641 --> 19:46.061
Annie called.
She's not coming back.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.271
This is not
the best time...

19:47.396 --> 19:49.857
Look, you said the heparin
would keep new clots from forming.

19:49.982 --> 19:51.984
Maybe. But something's
obviously causing the clots.

19:52.109 --> 19:53.151
If you have
pancreatic cancer...

19:53.277 --> 19:54.403
We're not trying
to scare you,

19:54.528 --> 19:56.613
but even in its early
stages, the fatality rate...

19:56.738 --> 19:57.573
You walk out of here...

19:57.698 --> 19:58.782
(SHOUTING) Stop!

20:01.326 --> 20:03.453
Look, I'd ask you to put
yourself in my place,

20:03.579 --> 20:06.206
but nobody can put
themselves in my place.

20:07.291 --> 20:11.003
Did she find somebody new?
Was I not being attentive enough? No.

20:12.129 --> 20:14.798
She's just tired of being
insulted by a limb.

20:15.507 --> 20:19.303
She said that my feelings
toward her were mixed.

20:19.428 --> 20:21.471
Well,
my feelings aren't mixed.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.683
You're not going anywhere.

20:24.808 --> 20:27.102
Unless you want to go naked.

20:27.436 --> 20:30.606
Your right brain knows
you need to stay.

20:31.857 --> 20:33.901
My right brain's an ass.

20:34.651 --> 20:35.819
(SIGHING)

20:36.486 --> 20:37.487
(DOOR OPENING)

20:38.280 --> 20:39.656
CAMERON: Got a minute?

20:40.449 --> 20:42.618
There's something
wrong with this cup.

20:43.577 --> 20:46.413
I need someone to bounce ideas off of.
Someone to be my whiteboard.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.623
That's how you
taught me to work.

20:47.748 --> 20:49.249
I have three choices.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.586
First, I can accept it's over, pretend
we don't work in the same hospital,

20:52.711 --> 20:55.547
have selective visual impairment
when we pass each other in the hall.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.799
Second, I can accept
it's over and leave.

20:57.925 --> 20:59.718
Or you could try
making him angry.

20:59.843 --> 21:01.678
Standard choice number three.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.139
Third, I can talk to him.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.976
But it's not like I have
any new facts I can present,

21:08.101 --> 21:11.355
and Chase has this romantic view of love
that reality can't compete with.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.481
(SIGHING)

21:12.606 --> 21:13.899
I know how you
could succeed.

21:14.024 --> 21:15.025
How?

21:15.734 --> 21:19.738
Just say the magic words,
"I will destroy my husband's sperm."

21:20.906 --> 21:23.533
You mean, succeed without
doing that? Probably not.

21:26.787 --> 21:29.790
I have doubts.
Normal doubts.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.209
It's not wrong to prepare for
bad things to happen,

21:32.334 --> 21:33.543
even if
you don't expect them to.

21:33.669 --> 21:36.713
I don't expect my condo
to burn down, but I have fire insurance.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.885
Patient's girlfriend left him,
now he wants to leave us.

21:46.306 --> 21:50.644
If your condo rules don't let you buy
insurance, do you go homeless?

21:53.230 --> 21:54.815
His room is this way.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.650
What? You think
I can fix this?

21:56.775 --> 21:58.610
We need to offer this guy
something he can only get

21:58.735 --> 22:01.530
if he stays in the hospital.
Relationship counseling.

22:01.655 --> 22:02.739
I don't know if
his girlfriend is...

22:02.864 --> 22:04.199
I mean his
two hemispheres.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.744
That's the breakfast of relationships,
the most important one of the day.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.913
We need your
special skills.

22:14.126 --> 22:15.752
SCOTT: ls the guy out there?

22:15.877 --> 22:18.171
The guy that's gonna
make my right brain work?

22:18.296 --> 22:19.464
Oh, for...

22:21.258 --> 22:23.135
What do you think
your right brain wants?

22:23.260 --> 22:27.180
<i>How should I know? It's crazy,
it does things I would never do.</i>

22:27.305 --> 22:31.184
Duct of Wirsung slightly enlarged,
but within normal parameters.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.312
Say something.

22:34.438 --> 22:36.690
<i>It's mute. It can't
communicate with you.</i>

22:36.815 --> 22:39.776
Maybe you should try
communicating with it.

22:40.444 --> 22:43.739
"Talk to her."
The well isn't deep, is it?

22:44.197 --> 22:46.783
You're the dominant half,
you make all the decisions.

22:46.908 --> 22:51.204
The right side has no control over
anything. it must be frustrating.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.582
No masses in body
or tail segments.

22:53.707 --> 22:56.126
<i>I can't communicate with it,
that's the whole...</i>

22:56.251 --> 22:58.920
When you decide to
go and get groceries, what do you do?

22:59.046 --> 23:01.256
<i>What do you mean? I put on my jacket
and I go to the store.</i>

23:01.381 --> 23:02.632
Your right brain
has no idea

23:02.758 --> 23:04.634
why you're suddenly
getting up and putting on your jacket.

23:04.760 --> 23:08.722
It just gets dragged along.
Next time, try saying it out loud.

23:08.847 --> 23:10.474
Just say to
the empty air,

23:10.599 --> 23:14.686
"Hey, I think I'll go to the store
because we're out of peanut butter"?

23:14.811 --> 23:16.480
How much did they teach you
about people like me

23:16.605 --> 23:18.148
when you were learning
to be a therapist?

23:18.273 --> 23:19.941
I'm an oncologist.

23:21.151 --> 23:24.696
Your right brain likes what he's saying.
Hasn't moved the entire scan.

23:24.821 --> 23:27.282
Hasn't gotten us anything, though.
Sean's clean.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.451
It's not pancreatic cancer.

23:29.576 --> 23:33.288
Clotting could be a problem
well before a solid tumor forms.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.414
It could still
be pancreatic.

23:34.539 --> 23:37.459
Yes, but if you want
a diagnosis backed by actual evidence,

23:37.584 --> 23:39.294
we should probably
look at other cancers.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.213
- House.
- I just squawked!

23:41.338 --> 23:42.714
- What?
- Eugene Schwartz.

23:42.839 --> 23:45.300
Your patient from yesterday.
I just squawked!

23:45.675 --> 23:49.346
I was buying some flowers for Mona.
It happened when I was paying the clerk.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.264
I assume Dr. Cuddy
gave you this number.

23:51.389 --> 23:55.352
Yes. She told me to call
you any time I squawked, day or night.

23:55.477 --> 23:56.686
I'm sorry, but I'm
about to lose you,

23:56.812 --> 24:00.065
because I'm about to drive into a tunnel
in a canyon on an airplane

24:00.190 --> 24:01.983
while hanging up the phone.

24:02.109 --> 24:04.319
I might be getting some more phone
calls, so let's make it fast.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.738
- Lymphoma.
- That's right, pancreatic.

24:06.863 --> 24:08.949
I know it's pancreatic.
I know there's evidence.

24:09.074 --> 24:11.368
I know we've seen it.
I just can't...

24:11.493 --> 24:13.245
Right brain/left brain
issues?

24:14.955 --> 24:17.582
If the cancer's too small
to find, let's make it easier.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.292
Let's open him up
and paint it.

24:19.417 --> 24:22.963
There's a new procedure using
scorpion toxin and infrared paint.

24:23.088 --> 24:25.465
The paint only works on the cancer
cells, makes them easier to spot.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.759
Just agitating the pancreas
can cause clotting,

24:27.884 --> 24:30.220
and you want to do it to a guy
whose problem is clotting?

24:30.345 --> 24:32.222
If I'm right about
pancreatic cancer,

24:32.347 --> 24:35.350
the only chance he's got is finding
and removing those cancer cells now.

24:35.475 --> 24:38.603
His brain MRI showed narrowing in the
blood vessels leading up from the neck.

24:38.728 --> 24:40.981
If we do shake something loose,
we could kill him.

24:41.106 --> 24:42.315
TAUB: Or one of him.

24:42.440 --> 24:46.903
A clot in his brain could kill one
of them without affecting the other.

24:47.696 --> 24:49.906
He might actually
be okay with that.

24:55.871 --> 24:57.247
FOREMAN: How long
is it going to take?

24:57.372 --> 25:00.208
Assuming he doesn't
crash, a few minutes.

25:10.218 --> 25:14.764
Hey, you and Cameron...
I'm sorry.

25:19.311 --> 25:21.313
I'll be right back.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.030
I don't want
to be homeless.

25:30.155 --> 25:33.116
Okay. You can stay in
the condo. I'll find some other...

25:33.241 --> 25:34.701
That's not what I mean.

25:36.328 --> 25:41.333
I want to marry you.
I got the forms to destroy the sperm.

25:42.626 --> 25:44.002
You sure?

25:44.628 --> 25:45.795
Yeah.

25:47.339 --> 25:49.549
I want to hug you, but
then I'd have to re-scrub.

25:49.674 --> 25:50.634
I know.

25:52.636 --> 25:54.429
FOREMAN: BP is dropping.

25:54.846 --> 25:55.931
Go.

25:57.349 --> 26:00.602
No sign of cancer.
BP is 90 over 60.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.196
You never answered
my question.

26:11.404 --> 26:15.283
Relax. Our friendship
is not doomed.

26:15.408 --> 26:18.495
Thank God. But my question was,
do you really want Cuddy,

26:18.620 --> 26:21.248
or is this just
another challenge?

26:21.373 --> 26:23.541
You're worried that once
I'm in a relationship,

26:23.667 --> 26:24.501
you and me will be over.

26:24.626 --> 26:27.254
Hey, I'm actually for this.
I think this is great.

26:27.379 --> 26:30.674
But if you're serious,
and you don't treat it seriously,

26:30.799 --> 26:33.093
then you will get hurt.

26:33.218 --> 26:37.389
And if you don't accept that,
then accept that she will get hurt.

26:43.853 --> 26:44.854
MAN: I was told it
was your birthday.

26:44.980 --> 26:45.981
I understand.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.524
So, so sorry.

26:48.483 --> 26:49.693
I know.

26:50.610 --> 26:51.444
Clearly, there was a mix-up.

26:51.569 --> 26:52.946
Have a nice day.

26:57.367 --> 26:58.285
Does she look angry?

26:58.410 --> 27:00.620
If you're standing there
when she looks up here...

27:06.918 --> 27:08.211
Oh, no.

27:09.546 --> 27:10.505
Systolic's 80.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.340
CHASE: Gotta finish this
suture before I can get out.

27:12.465 --> 27:13.300
Give him a dopamine drip.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.510
HOUSE: We weren't looking up
at the right time.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.387
Get to your point.
We're a little busy here.

27:17.512 --> 27:20.640
The clots aren't from cancer.
They're coming from his heart.

27:20.765 --> 27:22.058
We echoed the heart.
No clots.

27:22.183 --> 27:24.936
Not while we were looking.
Didn't! open with that?

27:25.061 --> 27:26.563
The clots were caused
by an arrhythmia.

27:26.688 --> 27:27.647
No arrhythmia.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.566
Not while we were looking.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.401
Intermittent arrhythmia.

27:31.526 --> 27:33.987
This guy pulls our equipment off
at the slightest provocation.

27:34.112 --> 27:36.197
We'd have to be watching at
the exact moment it happened,

27:36.323 --> 27:37.240
which I'm guessing,

27:37.365 --> 27:39.075
given the way you two
are scrambling around like idiots,

27:39.200 --> 27:40.577
is right now.

27:41.161 --> 27:43.997
Yes, I'm saying
do a transesophageal echo.

27:44.122 --> 27:45.373
We have to get
his BP stable.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.792
Absolutely.
Right after the echo.

27:48.877 --> 27:50.545
Systolic's 70.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.298
The heart looked healthy
at the last echo.

27:53.423 --> 27:56.801
And an arrhythmia wouldn't
cause clots in a healthy ventricle,

27:56.926 --> 27:59.304
so start with
the left atrial appendage.

28:04.267 --> 28:08.104
- Wow.
- Yep, I did it again.

28:08.229 --> 28:11.900
Now get this poor guy's BP under
control and seal off the appendage.

28:12.025 --> 28:15.070
And then all we have to do is
find out what damaged his heart

28:15.195 --> 28:17.364
before it goes
after something he really needs.

28:21.451 --> 28:23.870
So what damages
a healthy 20-year-old heart

28:23.995 --> 28:25.372
enough to make it send out clots

28:25.497 --> 28:27.999
- like it's bombing Dresden?
- Rhabdo.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.334
Would've fried
his kidneys, too.

28:29.459 --> 28:30.418
What about Graves'?

28:30.543 --> 28:32.420
Thyroid function
tests were normal.

28:32.545 --> 28:36.591
Cushing's. Cortisol overproduction
could interfere with heart rhythm.

28:37.050 --> 28:39.344
Run a dexamethasone
suppression test.

28:53.024 --> 28:54.025
Annie.

28:57.278 --> 28:58.988
You hit me.

28:59.114 --> 29:02.784
I know. I'm so sorry.
But it wasn't me.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.160
I know you would
never have done that

29:04.285 --> 29:06.830
if you were in
control of yourself, but...

29:07.497 --> 29:08.790
But you came back.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.959
To talk with your doctors.

29:11.084 --> 29:13.253
I've been going over
and over what happened.

29:13.378 --> 29:16.005
And I had this thought,
out of nowhere.

29:16.131 --> 29:18.675
Ever since I've known Scott, I've seen
his left hand throw things,

29:18.800 --> 29:22.262
but always sort of playfully,
thinking it's fun.

29:22.387 --> 29:26.558
But when he threw this, it was angry.

29:26.683 --> 29:31.229
And that's when his hand slapped me,
too, when I brought it to him.

29:31.354 --> 29:32.313
Could it mean something?

29:32.439 --> 29:33.857
TAUB: Deodorant shouldn't...

29:33.982 --> 29:35.984
How often do you use it?

29:36.609 --> 29:39.070
A few times a day. It's special,
heavy-duty stuff.

29:39.195 --> 29:40.405
I have to
send away for it.

29:40.530 --> 29:43.241
Sprayed around a bathroom
the size of a shoebox.

29:43.366 --> 29:45.452
I'll check the ingredients
from the manufacturer.

29:45.577 --> 29:48.371
I'll check for any references
associated with health issues.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.131
Somebody's grateful.

29:58.256 --> 30:01.050
We'll just leave
the three of you alone.

30:12.103 --> 30:14.564
Why is there
no lipstick on this cup?

30:14.689 --> 30:16.941
Cuddy was wearing lipstick
when she drank from it.

30:17.066 --> 30:19.444
It was on my face.
Why isn't it on the cup?

30:19.569 --> 30:24.324
Why is it always reasonable, in
Houseland, to take an emotional problem

30:24.449 --> 30:27.410
and sidestep it by turning
it into a mechanical problem?

30:27.535 --> 30:30.705
Because, in Houseland, and the rest
of the universe, by the way,

30:30.830 --> 30:33.500
when a question presents itself,
it calls for an answer.

30:33.625 --> 30:36.878
If the left brain is
the interpreter of reality

30:37.003 --> 30:42.717
and the one that tells us the story of
who we are, then what is your story?

30:42.842 --> 30:45.178
Do you want to be the man
with the answers?

30:45.303 --> 30:48.181
Or do you want to be
the man with Cuddy?

30:58.566 --> 30:59.943
What do I do?

31:01.528 --> 31:02.820
You make her angry.

31:03.404 --> 31:05.240
Do you really think that was
the best time to mock me?

31:05.365 --> 31:08.493
I'm as surprised as you,
but I think I'm serious.

31:08.618 --> 31:10.912
Communication can't start
unless you're both...

31:11.037 --> 31:12.205
I've been trying to
make her angry for...

31:12.330 --> 31:13.790
No, you haven't.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.543
Come on. Poo? Strippers?

31:16.668 --> 31:18.836
It's routine stuff.
You've been pulling your punches.

31:18.962 --> 31:20.171
You're scared.

31:20.296 --> 31:21.381
You should be.

31:28.096 --> 31:30.473
Now go terrorize her.

31:40.817 --> 31:43.570
You don't want to
destroy it, do you?

31:43.695 --> 31:46.114
I said I was gonna
do it, I'll do it.

31:46.239 --> 31:48.116
But you don't want to.

31:49.617 --> 31:52.787
I want to be with you. Maybe I'm not
comfortable with it, but...

31:52.912 --> 31:55.582
Let's say
it's our fifth anniversary.

31:55.707 --> 31:58.209
Are you ready
to destroy it now?

31:58.334 --> 32:00.211
Tenth. Three kids.

32:00.920 --> 32:03.423
They spend their summers
in Melbourne and have annoying accents.

32:03.548 --> 32:07.343
It's disgusting
how happy we are. You ready now?

32:13.266 --> 32:14.809
You don't have doubts.

32:15.518 --> 32:20.064
You just don't want to kill the only
thing left of someone you loved.

32:21.357 --> 32:22.900
(CRYING)

32:29.240 --> 32:30.908
Don't do it.

32:31.826 --> 32:34.495
I do have trouble
giving things up.

32:35.121 --> 32:41.127
For example, I never cancelled
any of our wedding plans.

32:41.252 --> 32:42.629
(LAUGHING)

32:56.142 --> 32:58.686
Attention!
I have an announcement.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.105
As you go about your day,

33:01.230 --> 33:06.402
I would like you to be aware of the fact
that I slept with Lisa Cuddy.

33:34.472 --> 33:37.308
This is beyond asshood.

33:37.433 --> 33:41.854
You have the luxury of not
caring about your image. I do not.

33:41.979 --> 33:44.190
I can permit a lot of crap,

33:44.315 --> 33:49.654
but an employee shouting
about his sexual exploits with me, no.

33:49.779 --> 33:54.367
That is zero tolerance.
So congratulations, House, I'm angry.

33:55.243 --> 33:57.745
I was wondering if we
should move in together.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.873
(LAUGHING)

34:06.629 --> 34:08.005
You're fired.

34:13.177 --> 34:16.889
I wouldn't worry about it.
I think she likes you.

34:17.181 --> 34:19.892
If I'm fired, I think that probably
means I don't have to see patients.

34:20.017 --> 34:22.395
I'm here as
a squeaky wheel.

34:22.520 --> 34:26.315
I know how you doctors
are, you're busy, you get distracted.

34:26.441 --> 34:28.317
My lab results could be
sitting in your inbox.

34:28.443 --> 34:31.154
I don't need your labs,
you have acid reflux.

34:31.279 --> 34:32.280
Well, how could you...

34:32.405 --> 34:34.031
Acid splashes on
the vocal cords,

34:34.157 --> 34:38.202
they tense, make that squawking sound.
It's completely harmless.

34:38.327 --> 34:41.122
I'm gonna give you a prescription,
and you're gonna go away.

34:41.247 --> 34:43.124
You are a great doctor.

34:45.918 --> 34:46.919
Why'd you move your belt?

34:47.044 --> 34:48.838
I always move my belt.

34:48.963 --> 34:50.548
It makes me sore.

34:51.424 --> 34:52.884
You didn't tell me that.

34:53.009 --> 34:55.178
At 86, what isn't sore?

34:55.303 --> 34:57.972
Soreness is less
important than squawking.

34:58.097 --> 35:00.141
It's the squawking
that was bothering my wife.

35:00.266 --> 35:01.225
(GROANING)

35:03.144 --> 35:05.646
That's not a potbelly.
That's a tumor.

35:08.524 --> 35:11.652
That's why pancreatic
cancer was on my mind.

35:13.237 --> 35:15.281
My brain was trying
to tell me...

35:15.782 --> 35:17.825
This isn't sounding good.

35:18.826 --> 35:20.661
Pancreatic cancer?

35:20.787 --> 35:23.790
Can cause acid reflux.
We should scope you.

35:23.915 --> 35:26.667
So it's not good.
Even for cancer, it's not good.

35:26.793 --> 35:28.169
No, it's not.

35:29.045 --> 35:31.380
The deodorant has a high proportion
of propylene glycol.

35:31.506 --> 35:34.217
Same stuff made a kid in Singapore
develop a heart condition

35:34.342 --> 35:36.052
and, get this, seizures.

35:36.177 --> 35:39.388
Our patient may never have needed
split-brain surgery.

35:39.514 --> 35:42.099
I'm sure he will half
appreciate the irony.

35:45.269 --> 35:48.689
Can you take this man to Radiology?
Pancreatic scan.

35:48.815 --> 35:50.441
And stay with him.

35:53.069 --> 35:54.654
Eugene Schwartz.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.710
Whatever it is,
just say it quickly.

36:11.128 --> 36:14.298
Do you have more than one lipstick
in the same shade?

36:14.423 --> 36:17.301
Maybe one that has a sealing agent,
and one that doesn't?

36:17.426 --> 36:20.555
How could that possibly
be relevant to anything?

36:23.349 --> 36:29.438
You really don't think you're just
overreacting to the other night?

36:31.941 --> 36:34.402
Fine. I am overreacting.

36:35.570 --> 36:38.823
You've said plenty of lousy
things to me before.

36:38.948 --> 36:42.785
But reaching the final straw
has been a good thing,

36:42.910 --> 36:48.583
because it made me realize we not only
don't have a personal relationship,

36:48.708 --> 36:50.418
we never could.

36:53.713 --> 36:55.423
You're...

36:59.969 --> 37:04.557
You've been overreacting
to something I said?

37:05.641 --> 37:08.394
You insulted me,
I walked out.

37:08.519 --> 37:11.647
It's nothing that hasn't happened
a hundred times before.

37:17.028 --> 37:18.029
(EXHALING)

37:18.988 --> 37:20.323
I quit.

37:20.907 --> 37:21.991
Great.

37:24.368 --> 37:29.040
My nanny is off the clock at 7:30.
So your week off...

37:29.165 --> 37:31.250
You can go suckle
the little bastard child

37:31.375 --> 37:33.461
who makes you
feel good about yourself.

37:36.589 --> 37:38.049
Screw you.

37:55.483 --> 37:59.236
No, no. That's
not what happened.

37:59.362 --> 38:02.949
I told you that I needed you.
You helped me.

38:04.408 --> 38:06.035
Are you okay?

38:30.393 --> 38:31.852
Are you okay?

40:21.879 --> 40:27.968
So, this is the story you made up
about who you are. It's a nice one.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.599
Too bad it isn't true.

40:43.818 --> 40:45.111
No.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.322
I'm not okay.

41:27.069 --> 41:29.905
(STRING QUARTET PLAYING )
