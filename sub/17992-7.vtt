08:36.115 --> 08:38.251
Because I told her she needs
to stand her own ground

08:38.317 --> 08:40.152
and be a grown woman?

08:40.219 --> 08:42.321
I'm just trying to help
Morgan stand on her own

08:42.388 --> 08:43.522
two feet and grow.

08:43.589 --> 08:45.091
Why don't you help me
stand on my [bleep]

08:45.157 --> 08:47.793
own two feet and act
my [bleep] record?

08:47.860 --> 08:49.862
Not only did Yesi turn
Morgan against me,

08:49.929 --> 08:51.397
she's sitting on my music.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.599
I mean, I gave her my single
"ATM" weeks ago and

08:53.666 --> 08:55.268
she still hadn't played it.

08:55.334 --> 08:56.802
I'm going to keep it real,
if your song sucks,

08:56.869 --> 08:58.304
we're not playing it.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.206
So, obviously all my songs suck.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.475
Honestly I haven't
heard Ray's track yet.

09:02.541 --> 09:05.044
The truth is, he's a hit or miss
and at the end of the day if

09:05.111 --> 09:06.812
I'm not feeling the
record, I'm just not going

09:06.879 --> 09:09.849
to stand behind it, no
matter who gives it to me.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.017
[bleep] my song played.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.718

right now and play a whole

09:12.785 --> 09:13.619

off the chain, but when you're

I called him out for
working with Teairra

10:59.358 --> 11:02.128
Those lyrics are

11:02.194 --> 11:03.696
I feel like it's
really just the truth.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.097
If he doesn't get it,
he just doesn't get it.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.199
At least I got it out.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.935
I don't want to say anything,
but this is kind of scary.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.737
{\an5}Berg has told this girl in no
uncertain terms that he does

11:11.804 --> 11:14.006
not want her, he's
completely disrespected her.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.908
And now she's
done an ode to Berg.

11:15.975 --> 11:18.010
I'm taking it he hasn't
heard these lyrics yet.

11:18.077 --> 11:19.311
No, he hasn't heard them yet.

11:19.378 --> 11:20.913
It's going to be a moment.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.948
I have no clue what Hazel
expects out of this record,

11:23.015 --> 11:25.051
but if she thinks Bergy
is going to hear this song

11:25.117 --> 11:27.887
and then wife her down,
maybe she is even more

11:27.953 --> 11:29.822
delusional than he's
saying she is.

11:29.889 --> 11:31.223
I just hope he don't try to
pull the record and

11:31.290 --> 11:32.491
give it to Teairra.

11:32.558 --> 11:35.895
Somebody that you know that I'm
at odds with, why do that to me?

11:35.961 --> 11:36.962
You know what I'm saying?

11:37.029 --> 11:40.399
The combination of the
two is shady, it is fraud.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.668
Speaking of fraud ass bitches,
you know I used to do bottle

11:42.735 --> 11:44.703
service at this club
in west Hollywood.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.472
They are opening a new club
in Las Vegas called

11:46.539 --> 11:47.406
Ace of Diamonds.

11:47.473 --> 11:48.941
Nice.

11:49.008 --> 11:49.975
They called me and they're like,
"We want to put you on

11:50.042 --> 11:50.876
eight billboards."

11:50.943 --> 11:51.710
That's super cute.

11:51.777 --> 11:52.912
That's really cute.

11:52.978 --> 11:55.848
So, settee, settee, we're
talking about what we're doing.

11:55.915 --> 11:57.616
"We leased the club for ten
years from the Maderas

11:57.683 --> 11:58.884
family and da, da, da."

11:58.951 --> 12:01.287
And I'm like, "I've heard
that name before, Maderas.

12:01.353 --> 12:03.589
Nikki Maderas."

12:03.656 --> 12:05.191

12:05.257 --> 12:06.525

12:08.561 --> 12:10.529
Well, isn't this ironic?

12:10.596 --> 12:12.064
So, meanwhile I'm at the shoot,
I'm in the tub,

12:12.131 --> 12:13.966
covered in diamonds.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.635
Nikki comes clunking in.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.671

all these questions,

12:18.737 --> 12:19.972
"Are you guys in a relationship?

wants to believe?

in because she'll see it when

15:41.774 --> 15:43.976

Hills on Friday night.

15:44.043 --> 15:45.444
Announcer: Police officers
responded to a sexual

15:45.511 --> 15:46.812
battery complaint.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.581
Ray J allegedly
touched a woman's butt.

15:49.648 --> 15:52.418
Ray J allegedly kicked out the
window of the police window.

15:52.484 --> 15:54.820
Announcer: Cops said Ray J
became combative and spit

15:54.887 --> 15:57.122
in one of the officers' faces.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.358
Another weekend, another
celeb getting popped for

15:59.425 --> 16:01.193
doing something stupid.

16:01.260 --> 16:06.932
♪♪

16:06.999 --> 16:10.035
You know what, I spent nine
hours in jail over some BS.

16:10.102 --> 16:13.172
Yeah, I was a little turned
up, but only because I got mad.

16:13.238 --> 16:15.541
And let me just say this, I
ain't never been in jail before

16:15.607 --> 16:18.043
{\an5}and I don't ever
want to go again.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.712
I know mom's going to be
embarrassed, Brandy's going

16:19.778 --> 16:23.148
{\an5}to be pissed, Princess is
going to be concerned.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.783
So, right now I'm going to have
my homeboy Cash come

16:24.850 --> 16:26.852
and pick me up and I'm going
to try to hold the backlash

16:26.919 --> 16:29.154
off for as long as I can.

16:29.221 --> 16:30.456
Good looking out.

16:30.522 --> 16:32.958
{\an8}I'm trying to figure out
why I'm picking you up

16:33.025 --> 16:34.626
{\an8}from the police station.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.328
I'm at the Beverly Wilshire.

16:36.395 --> 16:39.298
All of the sudden
some random [bleep]

16:39.365 --> 16:41.934
come up to me and say something
about me grabbing some girl.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.702
I'm like, "Huh,
where is the girl?

16:43.769 --> 16:44.937
No girl."

16:45.003 --> 16:46.939
I'm like, whatever you talking
about that I did, the person

16:47.005 --> 16:48.741
that I did it to
would be right here.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.476
Ain't even no person exists."

16:50.542 --> 16:53.479
I got loud and belligerent, so
he like, "You gotta get out,

16:53.545 --> 16:55.214
or I'm going to make a
citizen's arrest."

16:55.280 --> 16:56.448
And that's what turned me up.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.449
I'm like, "What?"

16:57.516 --> 16:58.417
I went crazy.

16:58.484 --> 16:59.518
Then they called the police.

16:59.585 --> 17:00.853
They arrested me.

17:00.919 --> 17:04.623
And you kicked a
window out of the cop car.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.090
Which I shouldn't have did.

17:06.157 --> 17:08.260
All right, so maybe that
wasn't the smartest thing to do.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.829
I ain't ever been in
this situation before.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.198
No one can tell you what to do
when cuffs are thrown on you.

17:13.265 --> 17:14.833
I was unprepared.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.402
I'm dealing with the label.

17:16.468 --> 17:19.771
They asking me about
what's going on with Ray J.

17:19.838 --> 17:21.272
I [bleep] up about this one.

17:21.339 --> 17:22.674
I admit that.

17:22.741 --> 17:24.309
I feel terrible about it.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.778
Was you intoxicated?

17:25.844 --> 17:27.311
That ain't had
nothing to do with that.

17:27.378 --> 17:31.517
I need you to admit to yourself
that you are losing control.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.118
I don't drink every day.

17:33.185 --> 17:36.688
All is take is one
bad day, one bad day.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.357
That's what I'm
saying, I don't gotta drink.

17:38.424 --> 17:39.391
I don't wake up and drink.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.127
I don't wake up with you.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.462
Come on, bud.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.664
I do turn up and yes,
I like to drink,

17:45.731 --> 17:48.233
but I am not an alcoholic.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.303
Somebody disrespects me,
or they attack my girl,

17:51.370 --> 17:53.505
or they're disloyal,
then it is what it is.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.641
If you can abide by
the rules of Ray J,

17:55.707 --> 17:58.143
then everything is all straight.

17:58.210 --> 18:01.880
The reason why you ended up
in jail is because you took

18:01.947 --> 18:03.081
it somewhere else.

18:03.148 --> 18:04.516
I know what they did.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.786
So, I got loud, they threw
me in the back of the car.

18:07.853 --> 18:10.789
The turn up at the RayJ.com,
that wasn't on you, right?

18:10.856 --> 18:12.558
That wasn't on you.

18:12.624 --> 18:13.926
The turn up at
the tattoo parlor,

that wasn't on you, right?

18:14.927 --> 18:15.661
No.

18:15.727 --> 18:16.895
Okay.

something you can't control?

You've been on and
off for eight years.

It can't be because
we've been on and off.

we've been on and off.

because I cheated, say that.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.698

then, we should hook right up,

we should be the
best of friends.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.165
Why?

21:07.232 --> 21:08.634
Because he seems
like a cool dude.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.268
He's been doing this
since you was born.

33:01.279 --> 33:02.947
And right now he's in trouble
and he needs people who

33:03.014 --> 33:04.916
really care about him.

33:04.982 --> 33:10.722
So, I decided to reach out
and make the first move.

33:10.788 --> 33:12.557
What's up?

33:12.623 --> 33:13.558
A lot.

33:13.624 --> 33:15.059
What's up with you?

33:15.126 --> 33:16.294
Working.

33:16.361 --> 33:18.596
I know you had a little
drama or whatever and I was

33:18.663 --> 33:20.198
just concerned about you.

33:20.264 --> 33:22.967
I got arrested
for some [bleep].

33:23.034 --> 33:24.469
So, you didn't do it?

33:24.535 --> 33:27.939
My lawyer gotta
find out what I did.

33:28.005 --> 33:29.073
Are you okay?

33:29.140 --> 33:30.441
Yeah, I'm straight.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.810
You know, I haven't talked to
you since the tattoo party.

33:32.877 --> 33:35.880
It's kind of odd for me to come
in here and just inquire

33:35.947 --> 33:37.315
about your wellbeing.

33:37.382 --> 33:42.520
But I wanted to apologize about
the way things have been, not

33:42.587 --> 33:47.125
only at the tattoo party, but
at the RayJ.com party as well.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.293
All right, so you went in the
party and you did what you

33:49.360 --> 33:52.296
did and I hope you're
happy about how you.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.465
And I hope you're happy
about how you reacted to that.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.801
All I know is.

33:56.868 --> 34:01.406
You think that was cool,
you acting a fool too?

34:01.472 --> 34:03.775
I feel like I'm
owed an apology too.

34:03.841 --> 34:05.943
Well, you're never
going to get it.

34:06.010 --> 34:08.713
Listen, the last thing I
owe you is an apology.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.149
You attack my girl, you beat
me up, you begged for a

34:11.215 --> 34:12.350
bag that you wanted.

34:12.417 --> 34:14.385
I gave it back to you and now
you're mad because of how

34:14.452 --> 34:15.987
I gave it back to you.

34:16.053 --> 34:17.789
And you want to come to the
studio and act like you care

34:17.855 --> 34:19.757
because I got locked up.

34:19.824 --> 34:20.992
Please.

34:21.058 --> 34:23.661
Whatever I have for you,
it's way in the past,

34:23.728 --> 34:25.963
and that's where
I'm gonna keep it.

34:26.030 --> 34:29.833
I still feel like we have a
history together and

34:29.900 --> 34:32.737
I don't want to be where
it is right now.

34:32.804 --> 34:36.306
I just want to kind of
smooth it over and just move on.

34:36.373 --> 34:38.042
Yeah, well, if you can
accept that I'm happy in

34:38.109 --> 34:41.712
the relationship I'm with and
that I do love my girl.

34:41.779 --> 34:43.514
I mean, I realized that a long
time ago when you were cheating

34:43.581 --> 34:47.185
with her when you was with me.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.286
I did not cheat on you
because we wasn't ever

34:49.353 --> 34:50.221
together like that.

34:50.288 --> 34:51.355
Okay.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.889
I'm sitting here listening
to Ray deny almost

34:52.956 --> 34:54.891
nine years of our lives.

34:54.958 --> 34:57.462
No matter what he thinks of me
right now, I would expect him

34:57.528 --> 35:00.498
to remember that at some
point we were in love.

35:00.565 --> 35:03.601
You don't remember us
being together, then not being

35:03.668 --> 35:06.037
together, then
being together again.

35:06.103 --> 35:08.139
I remember us [bleep]
around and I [bleep]

35:08.206 --> 35:10.308
around and then
[bleep] around again.

35:10.374 --> 35:13.578
Okay, so maybe I'm
delusional in that state.

35:13.644 --> 35:14.779
I apologize.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.647
I think you're delusional.

35:16.714 --> 35:19.517
He's an [bleep] and that's why
I fell in love with him

35:19.584 --> 35:21.118
because I'm an [bleep] too.

35:21.185 --> 35:26.557
But in this moment I feel
like he punched me in my face.

35:26.624 --> 35:27.258
That's [bleep] up.

35:27.325 --> 35:28.593
What's [bleep] up?

35:28.659 --> 35:30.995
That you be sitting there and be
looking at me with these

35:31.062 --> 35:33.731
glossy eyes like you
don't give a [bleep].

35:33.798 --> 35:36.334
I get it, but it's
[bleep] up how you're acting

35:36.400 --> 35:37.568
and how you're treating me.

35:37.635 --> 35:38.669
It's [bleep] up.

35:38.736 --> 35:40.505
I'm not about to argue with you.

35:40.571 --> 35:42.640
It's not about arguing, Ray.

35:42.707 --> 35:44.775
