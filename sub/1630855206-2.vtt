00:01.583 --> 00:05.000
-KID 1: Asha!
-WOMAN 1: Asha, come out now.

00:06.375 --> 00:08.000
MAN 1: Asha, where are you?

00:08.958 --> 00:11.166
KID 2: Asha, where are you?

00:11.250 --> 00:13.250
(ominous music playing)

00:13.916 --> 00:15.250
KID 1: Asha!

00:15.333 --> 00:17.541
-KID 2: Asha.
-MAN 1: Asha!

00:21.333 --> 00:23.416
KID 3: Asha!

00:24.958 --> 00:26.791
(boat engine revving)

00:26.875 --> 00:28.875
(unsettling music playing)

00:37.000 --> 00:38.500
(birds chirping)

00:39.083 --> 00:41.458
(birds cawing)

00:41.541 --> 00:43.833
ANTON: We're moving the search
to the other side.

00:45.833 --> 00:47.416
Asha hated it here.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.708
Once she meets Mommy, she won't hate it.

00:51.083 --> 00:52.500
She said she had television.

00:53.291 --> 00:56.500
-Dolls. Food whenever she wanted...
-Asha has the Devil in her, Amy.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.583
She was tempting you,
trying to turn your back to the light.

01:01.083 --> 01:02.125
Come on.

01:02.833 --> 01:03.833
Come on!

01:07.333 --> 01:09.333
(suspenseful music playing)

01:11.500 --> 01:13.625
-KID 1: Asha?
-KID 2: Asha.

01:13.708 --> 01:15.041
KID 3: Asha!

01:15.125 --> 01:17.333
-(telephone rings)
-(Hannah pants)

01:21.500 --> 01:22.375
Hello?

01:22.458 --> 01:24.083
We've just turned off the freeway, Hannah.

01:24.166 --> 01:25.375
Please have the children ready,

01:25.458 --> 01:28.208
and tell Asha
Mommy's very excited to meet her.

01:28.291 --> 01:30.291
(call ends)

01:30.375 --> 01:32.125
(footsteps approaching)

01:34.666 --> 01:36.041
HANNAH: Your mother's coming.

01:36.208 --> 01:37.875
Go tell them, Aaron.

01:38.541 --> 01:39.625
Go.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.291
(yells)
Go!

01:45.583 --> 01:46.708
AARON: Mommy's coming.

01:46.791 --> 01:48.375
-KID 1: Asha!
-KID 2: Asha!

01:49.625 --> 01:50.708

-KID 5: Asha!

01:52.750 --> 01:53.875
-AARON: Mommy's coming!
-KIDS: Asha!

01:53.958 --> 01:54.958
Asha!

01:55.041 --> 01:56.833
Asha!

01:56.916 --> 01:58.041
(whistles)

01:58.583 --> 02:02.916
For every minute your sister's not found,
it's an hour in the Hole.

02:03.541 --> 02:04.583
-KID 1: Asha?
-KID 2: Asha!

02:04.666 --> 02:05.791
-Where are you?
-MAN: Asha!

02:05.875 --> 02:07.708
-KID 3: Asha!
-KID 4: Asha!

02:08.375 --> 02:09.708
Asha?

02:09.791 --> 02:11.208
KID 5: Asha!

02:12.875 --> 02:14.083
-KID 6: Asha?
-KID 7: Asha.

02:14.166 --> 02:16.125
-KID 8: Asha!
-KID 9: Asha!

02:16.208 --> 02:17.041

02:17.125 --> 02:17.958
KID 10: Asha!

02:18.041 --> 02:22.791
KIDS: Asha! Asha! Asha!

02:23.458 --> 02:24.291
KID 11: Asha!

02:24.625 --> 02:25.875
HENRIK: Come on!

02:25.958 --> 02:27.708
Fan out in a straight line.

02:28.791 --> 02:30.666
Follow me. Follow me.

02:32.541 --> 02:34.541
(ominous music continues playing)

02:49.916 --> 02:50.958
I've found her!

02:53.041 --> 02:55.041
(theme music playing)

03:23.166 --> 03:25.791
BILLY: Can I please, please,
please have a lunch order?

03:25.875 --> 03:27.708
FREYA: No. No, I made you

03:27.791 --> 03:29.416
-a very yummy cheese sandwich.
-REPORTER: There are no new leads

03:29.500 --> 03:32.083
in the search for missing Woodfield girl,
Carrie Anderson.

03:32.166 --> 03:33.708
Her family are pleading

03:33.791 --> 03:35.958
-for any information.
-BILLY: But Harry has one every Friday.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.875
CARRIE'S MOTHER:
If anyone has seen anything,

03:37.958 --> 03:40.458
-or knows anything...
-Grab your bag, Bilbo.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.791
All right, have a good day.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.708
-BILLY: Bye, Mama.
-(school bell rings)

03:49.541 --> 03:50.541
Harry!

03:51.458 --> 03:52.375
MS. LE: Hi, Billy.

03:52.458 --> 03:53.541
-HARRY: Billy, how are you?
-STUDENT: Bye bye.

03:53.625 --> 03:54.708
-HARRY: Good?
-BILLY: Good.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.666
Oh. Hey, Freya.

03:57.291 --> 04:00.958
Um, the Moms of 2C, we were saying
we deserve a night out. What do you think?

04:02.666 --> 04:03.625
Yeah, sounds great.

04:03.708 --> 04:06.250
JENNY: Yeah, leave the hard work
to the dads for once.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.083
Geoff is so seriously useless.

04:08.166 --> 04:10.666
At Harry's birthday, he got
a migraine from blowing up one balloon.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.875
-Like, one balloon.
-Yeah.

04:11.958 --> 04:13.166
(both chuckle)

04:13.250 --> 04:15.166
-WOMAN: Careful, kids.
-I mean, not that I'm complaining.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.416
I mean, being a single parent,
I can't imagine...

04:17.500 --> 04:18.500
Oh, it's fine.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.125
It's all I've ever known.

04:20.666 --> 04:21.708
MS. LE: Get to class.

04:21.791 --> 04:23.250
Oh, was it a one-night stand?

04:23.833 --> 04:26.291
Oof. What I would do
to have one of those right now.

04:26.375 --> 04:27.291
-(Jenny chuckles)
-(chuckles awkwardly)

04:27.875 --> 04:29.000
MS. LE: Freya?

04:29.083 --> 04:30.416
Have you got time for a quick word?

04:31.083 --> 04:32.666
-Oh, text me.
-Yeah.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.833
-Hey.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.291
Um, I just want to check in with you.

04:42.708 --> 04:44.625
-Okay.
-Yeah. Um...

04:45.458 --> 04:47.041
Is everything all right at home?

04:49.291 --> 04:51.250
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

04:52.083 --> 04:53.125
FREYA: Yeah.

04:53.833 --> 04:56.958
It's just that, um,
it's school protocol...

04:57.791 --> 04:59.916
to follow up on any injury.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.083
Oh, you're talking about
Billy's black eye.

05:04.166 --> 05:06.041
-MS. LE: Mm.
-Yeah, um...

05:06.125 --> 05:09.291
He was behind the door
and-- And I opened the door

05:09.375 --> 05:12.083
and I didn't realize he was behind it.

05:12.333 --> 05:14.458
Yeah, of course. I totally understand.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.541
Sole parenting is hard.

05:20.041 --> 05:21.166
It was an accident.

05:21.916 --> 05:22.916
That's all.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.875
My mom was right there.
She saw the whole thing.

05:25.541 --> 05:27.833
Have we got your mom's details on file?

05:28.958 --> 05:30.000
MS. LE: No.

05:30.083 --> 05:32.041
-Uh, no.
-(cell phone ringing)

05:32.125 --> 05:34.375
-You don't.
-Perhaps you can add them to Billy's file?

05:34.458 --> 05:35.708
-Yeah.
-In case we have to verify anything

05:35.791 --> 05:37.750
-for our report...
-Sorry, I actually have to get this.

05:41.791 --> 05:43.583
Hey Mo, is everything okay?

05:43.666 --> 05:45.708
(foreboding music playing)

05:52.791 --> 05:54.500
(door opens)

05:54.583 --> 05:55.708
FREYA: Hello?

05:55.791 --> 05:57.291
MO: Freya, hey.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.708
I found her tracker in the laundry basket.

06:01.166 --> 06:03.916
Mrs. Beaufort is not safe
wandering around out there

06:04.000 --> 06:04.916
-on her own.
-Yeah, I know.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.666
I'll have to put it on my daily report
and if this keeps happening,

06:07.750 --> 06:11.375
-the agency will insist on 24-hour care...
-It's okay, Mo, it's okay.

06:11.458 --> 06:14.375
You don't have to do that.
I'll find her. I always do.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.291
(Freya breathes deeply)

06:24.083 --> 06:26.166
(suspenseful music playing)

06:48.125 --> 06:49.541
ADRIENNE: Hands down.

06:54.291 --> 06:55.875
Have you been eating sweets again?

07:00.916 --> 07:02.083
Come here, my darling.

07:09.416 --> 07:11.791
Welcome home, my angel.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.416
We're so happy to have you here.

07:25.791 --> 07:27.208
ADRIENNE: Go back in the line.

07:44.458 --> 07:45.375
ANTON: I found her for you, Mommy.

07:47.541 --> 07:48.583
Asha ran away.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.666
She was hiding up a tree, but I found her.

07:53.791 --> 07:56.083
(ominous music playing)

08:00.666 --> 08:03.500
You make your mother very proud, Anton.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.875
Maitreya, I can explain.

08:16.958 --> 08:19.791
ADRIENNE: Not only do you kidnap a child,
but then you allow her to escape.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.208
-It was Amy's job to take care of Asha...
-Do you want to destroy us, is that it?

08:23.291 --> 08:24.250
TAMSIN: No.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.333
Abigail's roots are showing,
Annabelle's getting fat

08:26.416 --> 08:28.041
and Adam is scratching like a leper.

08:28.125 --> 08:29.333
(doorbell dings)

08:32.875 --> 08:34.958
(indistinct chatter)

08:39.000 --> 08:39.833
(Freya sighs)
Mom.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.583
You can't keep leaving the house
on your own.

08:42.666 --> 08:43.500
BRYCE: She's not on her own.

08:48.333 --> 08:51.083
If you want to take Mom out,
you need to inform the agency.

08:51.666 --> 08:54.500
-FREYA: They have a duty of care.
-BRYCE: As do you.

08:55.458 --> 08:58.666
Looking after your mother doesn't involve
locking her up in a dark house

08:58.750 --> 09:03.000
with a... with a tracking device,
like some sort of criminal.

09:04.125 --> 09:09.833
Exercise, sunshine
and intellectual stimulation.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.291
In my book, that's duty of care.

09:13.416 --> 09:14.625
(inhales deeply)

09:17.083 --> 09:18.875
Come on, Mom. Let's get you home.

09:19.541 --> 09:21.416
-Come on.
-BRYCE: Careful. Careful.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.708
Wonderful to see you, Maitreya.

09:25.791 --> 09:27.375
ADRIENNE: Lovely to meet you.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.208
As always.

09:33.916 --> 09:35.708
ADRIENNE: Is Mommy coming to pick me up?

09:39.375 --> 09:42.458
You'll be surrounded by carers 24/7
if you keep disappearing.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.250
You don't want that, do you?

09:45.333 --> 09:46.541
No, Amy.

09:47.833 --> 09:49.791
No elkhounds in the morning.

09:54.833 --> 09:56.833
(soft piano playing)

10:05.875 --> 10:08.291
(utensils clanking)

10:14.333 --> 10:15.541
Sit!

10:15.625 --> 10:17.625
(chairs screech)

10:38.500 --> 10:39.375
ADRIENNE: Asha.

10:39.458 --> 10:41.208
Darling, come.

10:42.666 --> 10:44.750
(piano continues playing)

10:51.416 --> 10:52.291
Asha?

11:02.916 --> 11:04.958
(utensils clanking)

11:10.291 --> 11:12.000
HANNAH: Abigail, wash. Adam, dry.

11:12.666 --> 11:15.500
Angela, sweep. Aaron, put the bins out.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.291
Neatly, please.

11:20.666 --> 11:21.708
Gently.

11:25.583 --> 11:32.250
ADRIENNE:
A present, for my favorite, special,

11:33.333 --> 11:35.708
beautiful Princess Asha.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.500
You're Mommy's favorite.

11:41.083 --> 11:42.125
Come in, Amy.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.291
Run along, my angel.

11:55.708 --> 11:57.083
ADRIENNE: Shut the door behind you.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.375
(car approaching)

12:13.125 --> 12:14.666
-(Freya panting)
-(camera shutter clicks)

12:14.750 --> 12:17.458
-(car horn honking)
-(gasps, sighs)

12:18.708 --> 12:21.125
(car engine revs)

12:24.750 --> 12:26.500
The van matches the description of the one

12:26.583 --> 12:28.625
that abducted Carrie Anderson
near Woodfield.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.166
FREYA (over phone): The same van
has been hanging around my house.

12:32.291 --> 12:34.833
-POLICE OFFICER: Right.
-Detective Joe Saad called the station.

12:34.916 --> 12:36.333
Requested you look into it.

12:36.416 --> 12:37.250
-(door opens)
-Who's he?

12:37.833 --> 12:40.833
Well, he's retired now,
but he-- He pulled some favors.

12:40.916 --> 12:42.083
No, it doesn't work like that.

12:42.166 --> 12:45.041
He'd have to file a report
like anyone else.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.083
POLICE OFFICER (over phone): And...
(sighs)

12:47.166 --> 12:48.333
(car door closes)

12:50.291 --> 12:51.583
...there's nothing in the system.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.083
(exhales sharply)

12:54.833 --> 12:56.000
ADRIENNE: How are you, Amy?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Good.

12:59.083 --> 13:02.125
Good is closely aligned with right.

13:03.333 --> 13:07.708
Is it possible, I wonder, to feel good
when one hasn't done right?

13:09.166 --> 13:10.208
No.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.666
So what are you, Amy?

13:16.458 --> 13:18.041
Not good.

13:18.125 --> 13:21.166
Do you think "sorry" might be
the word you're looking for?

13:22.041 --> 13:23.958
Yes. I'm sorry.

13:26.416 --> 13:27.708
For?

13:29.791 --> 13:31.500
For not realigning Asha.

13:33.208 --> 13:34.375
No, Amy.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.041
For not watching Asha.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.041
For not finding Asha?

13:45.208 --> 13:47.208
You're not trying hard enough, Amy.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.958
(ominous music playing)

13:53.291 --> 13:54.875
SARA: I wanna go home!

13:56.291 --> 13:58.333
(breathes deeply)

14:04.708 --> 14:06.166
ADRIENNE: Do you want me to help you?

14:08.083 --> 14:10.000
Did you betray your family?

14:13.208 --> 14:15.375
-Yes.
-Did you betray yourself?

14:17.625 --> 14:18.625
Yes.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.458
And?

14:22.333 --> 14:24.000
(voice breaking)
I betrayed you, Mommy.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.291
There we go.

14:28.750 --> 14:29.958
(breathes shakily)

14:30.041 --> 14:35.166
Mommy, your love binds us together
as one family, one heart.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.250
Together, we are united.
Alone, we are blighted.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.791
That's my girl.

14:43.041 --> 14:44.625
ADRIENNE: Now go and clean yourself up.

14:48.708 --> 14:50.125
And lower your hem.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.125
You look like a whore in that short skirt.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.250
(car door closes)

15:01.041 --> 15:02.041
FREYA: Joe!

15:07.041 --> 15:09.791
-Joe!
-JOE: You must have a sixth sense!

15:10.000 --> 15:11.916
Caught way more than I can eat.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.166
Check this catch out.

15:13.833 --> 15:15.416
You never called the cops.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.125
-Freya...
-I'm not a child.

15:19.208 --> 15:20.583
You don't need to pretend.

15:21.416 --> 15:23.708
Look, you know,
you'd gotten yourself into such a state.

15:23.791 --> 15:27.500
-I... I was just trying to reassure you.
-Lying to me isn't reassuring.

15:27.583 --> 15:28.750
Okay.

15:28.833 --> 15:31.208
You made me doubt what I saw, made me...

15:31.291 --> 15:32.625
made me feel crazy.

15:34.083 --> 15:38.958
-I saw the van, Joe.
-Freya, I did do some digging.

15:40.291 --> 15:41.416
It's real.

15:42.041 --> 15:45.000
There was no sighting
of any vehicle taking that little girl.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.500
-There was no white van?
-No.

15:54.375 --> 15:56.791
JOE: This Carrie Anderson...

15:58.416 --> 16:00.541
she's disappeared from Woodfield.

16:02.666 --> 16:05.666
I just think you assumed,

16:06.166 --> 16:08.208
-because...
-Asha.

16:16.333 --> 16:17.333
JOE: Come on.

16:18.375 --> 16:19.791
Stay for lunch.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.875
I'll barbecue these beauties up for us.

16:24.958 --> 16:25.958
(plate clanks)

16:26.041 --> 16:28.250
(birds cawing)

16:33.125 --> 16:36.500
I'm actually flattered you thought
the police would act on my orders.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.833
My name's pretty much dirt.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.125
Oh, it's worse than dirt.
They hadn't even heard of you.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.458
Don't hold back, will you?

16:47.625 --> 16:49.541
Oh, their loss I reckon.

17:02.916 --> 17:04.500
Henrik's parole has been approved.

17:11.833 --> 17:13.041
You think that
might have triggered something?

17:16.375 --> 17:17.958
You a psychiatrist now?

17:21.750 --> 17:23.208
To be honest,
I think you make a better chef.

17:23.541 --> 17:24.708
This is really good.

17:28.208 --> 17:31.375
22 years for a crime
you were brainwashed into committing.

17:31.791 --> 17:33.875
If I were Henrik,
I'd be looking for some compensation.

17:35.583 --> 17:37.708
Maybe a cut
of The Kindred's missing millions.

17:41.666 --> 17:43.125
He still committed a crime.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.083
JOE: Sure.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.041
We all know
the real criminal got off scot-free.

17:52.708 --> 17:54.041
Had any contact with her?

17:57.125 --> 17:58.125
No.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.291
If I could get near that mad old bitch,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.333
I'd happily strangle
the millions out of her myself.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.375
JOE: You know, you don't have to be angry
at me to come visit.

18:17.666 --> 18:18.625
(Freya chuckles softly)

18:19.583 --> 18:21.083
Bring Billy next time.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.041
-I'll take him fishing.
-Yeah. Yeah, he'd love that.

18:26.000 --> 18:26.833
Freya.

18:29.916 --> 18:33.708
Carrie Anderson...
she's probably lost in the woods.

18:37.375 --> 18:38.916
She'll make her way home.

18:40.625 --> 18:41.791
Yeah.

18:42.791 --> 18:43.791
FREYA: Thanks, Joe.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.291
BILLY: Mom, do you like ants?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.708
FREYA:
Sure, as long as they're not in the honey.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.458
Did you close the gate

18:58.541 --> 19:00.250
-after we left this morning?
-Yep.

19:00.333 --> 19:03.166
-Did you know ants don't have ears?
-No.

19:03.250 --> 19:06.875
BILLY: Ants are my favorite.
They're the most dangerous.

19:06.958 --> 19:08.916
Some of them don't have eyes.

19:09.291 --> 19:10.416
FREYA: Really?

19:10.958 --> 19:12.791
BILLY: Do you know what they use instead?

19:13.375 --> 19:15.000
Their antenna.

19:20.333 --> 19:24.333
Ants feel vibrations through their feet.
That's how they know if danger's coming.

19:24.416 --> 19:27.000
Oh, yeah? You've been learning
about ants at school?

19:27.083 --> 19:29.958
BILLY:
No, my friend tells me stuff about them.

19:31.291 --> 19:35.041
-What friend, Harry?
-No, my friend at the fence.

19:37.958 --> 19:39.208
What fence?

19:39.875 --> 19:40.791
The school fence?

19:40.875 --> 19:41.708
Yeah.

19:42.375 --> 19:43.708
FREYA: Billy...

19:44.458 --> 19:46.083
what does your friend look like?

19:46.583 --> 19:48.875
(shushes)

19:50.666 --> 19:51.875
Is that what your friend did?

19:53.541 --> 19:55.833
Billy, what did he say to you?

19:55.916 --> 19:57.416
-Ow!
-Tell me!

19:57.500 --> 19:59.750
Ms. Le says, "My body, my boundaries."

20:00.333 --> 20:01.500
(sighs)

20:02.208 --> 20:03.375
Yes.

20:03.458 --> 20:05.208
Ms. Le is absolutely right.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.333
(breathes deeply)

20:11.083 --> 20:13.125
(soft music playing)

20:15.166 --> 20:16.708
AMY: There's tiny sandwiches.

20:17.416 --> 20:20.333
And cake with cream inside.
Have you tasted cake before?

20:24.041 --> 20:25.125
First, we sing.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.750
Then Mommy speaks
and then what do we all say?

20:30.458 --> 20:33.875
We are one, Mother and united.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.875
-No, Asha.
-I don't want to.

20:36.958 --> 20:38.083
Ow!

20:42.208 --> 20:43.625
Repeat after me.

20:44.750 --> 20:47.916
Mother, your love binds us together
as one family.

20:48.000 --> 20:48.875
-One heart.

20:48.958 --> 20:50.208
-Together, we are united.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.541
-Alone, we are blighted.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.208
There we go.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.750
(unsettling music playing)

21:18.166 --> 21:20.666
(indistinct chatter)

21:41.666 --> 21:43.166
(camera shutter clicks)

21:46.916 --> 21:48.250
Go and join the others.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.625
(indistinct chatter)

21:58.166 --> 21:59.291
MAN: Good to see you.

22:00.416 --> 22:02.291
-Slow down. Line up.
-KIDS: She sells seashells

22:02.375 --> 22:03.458
on the seashore.

22:04.333 --> 22:05.916
KID: You're in front of me.

22:06.416 --> 22:07.416
(camera shutter clicks)

22:14.583 --> 22:16.125
Take me round the back, Tavi.

22:23.416 --> 22:26.333
Physicists like myself
understand structures

22:26.416 --> 22:29.291
to be malleable and ever-forming.

22:29.875 --> 22:32.208
They must be, in order to survive.

22:32.958 --> 22:38.125
Society, however, has convinced us
that structures are fixed and immutable.

22:38.208 --> 22:40.125
-AMY: Remember, follow me.
-BRYCE: Therefore, it must follow

22:40.208 --> 22:44.125
that, to accept this...
is to accept our own death.

22:44.958 --> 22:47.583
But it doesn't have to only be this way.

22:48.083 --> 22:52.166
The reason we are here today is
because our spiritual leader,

22:52.250 --> 22:55.208
Maitreya, is showing us an alternative.

22:57.458 --> 22:58.625
An alternative.

23:05.208 --> 23:10.000
As members of The Kindred,
and under Maitreya's guidance,

23:10.500 --> 23:16.541
we have the freedom and the power
to reinvent the structures of society

23:16.625 --> 23:19.083
that so many assume cannot be changed.

23:19.458 --> 23:24.791
And what better way to achieve this
than through a new generation.

23:36.875 --> 23:39.083
(classical music playing)

23:39.958 --> 23:43.416
(breathes deeply)

23:52.708 --> 23:54.333
Pleasure to see you.

23:59.458 --> 24:00.666
Lovely to see you.

24:01.583 --> 24:02.791
Walk along.

24:03.583 --> 24:05.666
(classical music continues playing)

24:09.833 --> 24:12.291
Welcome. My Kindred.

24:13.541 --> 24:14.750
Welcome, all of you.

24:16.375 --> 24:20.458
It's such a great honor to see
so many of you here today.

24:22.708 --> 24:25.208
I see so much wisdom in this room.

24:27.083 --> 24:30.041
The wisdom of those who are not afraid.

24:32.375 --> 24:36.500
I have had the great privilege
of guiding many of your Clearings,

24:36.916 --> 24:41.000
and I see how tall you stand afterwards.

24:41.083 --> 24:44.125
The light that shines from you.

24:44.708 --> 24:47.916
How life opens up

24:48.250 --> 24:51.958
when you are truly able to let go.

24:54.666 --> 24:58.541
Because it is only once
we have been cleared

24:59.291 --> 25:03.541
that you are ready to begin again.

25:07.875 --> 25:12.875
These children, my children...
(chuckles softly)

25:12.958 --> 25:18.166
...they are as pure and untainted
as it is possible to be.

25:20.041 --> 25:24.041
A generation raised away
from the suffocating rules of society,

25:25.208 --> 25:28.708
nurtured under
the most perfect conditions.

25:31.083 --> 25:35.458
These children are our Kindred, all of us.

25:37.208 --> 25:40.916
ALL: Mother, your love
binds us together as one family.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.750
-She's a liar. She's not my mother.
-(feedback)

25:44.833 --> 25:46.250
-SARA: Stop!
-TAMSIN: Come with me.

25:47.958 --> 25:49.708
SARA: Stop. Let me go!

25:49.791 --> 25:52.041
-Let go of me! Ow.
-ADRIENNE: Goodness.

25:52.125 --> 25:55.916
Oh, I'm sorry to say even I haven't cured
the world of mother-daughter conflict.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.166

JOE:
Don't supposed the enlightened get cancer.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.375
ADRIENNE: Detective Saad.
Fancy seeing you here.

26:55.000 --> 26:55.875
JOE: Fancy.

26:58.041 --> 26:59.666
Mind you, I shouldn't be surprised.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.125
Mongrel dogs do tend to hang around
back doors, waiting for scraps.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.083
Scraps?
(scoffs)

27:07.166 --> 27:08.708
I'm way past scraps.

27:08.791 --> 27:11.458
I've got a dossier on you
the size of 10 phone books.

27:13.125 --> 27:14.083
Goodness.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.583
I'd say that's bordering on obsession.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.291
ADRIENNE: What's your wife think?

27:20.375 --> 27:22.291
She must be craving
some of your attention.

27:23.458 --> 27:25.875
Plenty of time for that
when you're all behind bars.

27:36.166 --> 27:38.291
Buy Dina some flowers on your way home.

27:39.458 --> 27:42.291
ADRIENNE: Show her this other woman means
nothing to you.

27:42.833 --> 27:44.291
She's the one you really love.

27:53.416 --> 27:55.625
(indistinct chatter)

28:16.208 --> 28:17.333
(Judith exhales deeply)

28:18.750 --> 28:21.416
JUDITH: I thought it was him,
but I'm the one holding the knife.

28:22.666 --> 28:23.750
And I'm not sorry.

28:25.416 --> 28:26.750
I'm elated.

28:29.083 --> 28:34.375
I'm dancing on a corpse
and it's not his, it's mine.

28:34.958 --> 28:36.958
(sobbing)

28:38.291 --> 28:40.166
You've been reborn.

28:41.125 --> 28:45.041
Know thyself, Judith,
and thou shalt know the universe.

28:45.125 --> 28:46.458
(Judith inhales deeply)

28:46.541 --> 28:48.708
-COLIN: Sorry.
-It's okay. Come, come.

28:50.208 --> 28:51.833
(exhales deeply)

28:55.000 --> 28:59.250
Judith, darling. Colin is hurting
and I must clear him now, okay?

29:00.250 --> 29:02.416
-Good job.
-Thank you, Maitreya.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.750
-(Judith breathes deeply)
-ADRIENNE: Come.

29:06.833 --> 29:09.041
(classical music playing)

29:19.750 --> 29:20.708
Have you got it?

29:28.583 --> 29:29.916
COLIN: My wife, Elena.

29:32.083 --> 29:33.250
I think she's...

29:36.708 --> 29:38.791
beginning to suspect who I really am.

29:41.125 --> 29:44.708
ADRIENNE:
You must release her from her pain, Colin.

29:46.208 --> 29:49.833
You can't live a lie
and you can't expect her to.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.250
Your family is here,

29:54.833 --> 29:58.083
surrounded by those
who love and accept you.

30:00.458 --> 30:02.166
Find your strength, Colin.

30:02.250 --> 30:03.166
Hmm.

30:03.958 --> 30:06.125
Yes, yes.

30:15.041 --> 30:16.333
How was it?

30:19.958 --> 30:21.875
What do you think they'll do to Asha?

30:26.500 --> 30:27.458
The Hole.

30:29.541 --> 30:30.916
She deserves it.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.250
She wouldn't be punished
if you'd let her go.

30:38.416 --> 30:40.583
She wouldn't be punished
if you'd aligned her.

30:42.708 --> 30:46.375
I wonder who'll get the worst punishment,
you or Asha.

30:49.166 --> 30:51.375
(classical music continues playing)

31:17.500 --> 31:19.916
(ominous music playing)

31:22.458 --> 31:24.250
(exhales slowly)

31:30.500 --> 31:32.708
(panting)

31:45.083 --> 31:47.375
(ominous music continues playing)

31:48.666 --> 31:51.000
(inhales deeply)

32:04.250 --> 32:07.458
(breathes deeply)

32:16.875 --> 32:19.875
(breathes shakily)

32:30.750 --> 32:32.958
(foreboding music playing)

32:51.583 --> 32:54.708
SARA: Leave me alone! You're hurting me!

32:55.500 --> 32:57.791
(Sara shouting)

32:57.875 --> 33:01.083
You're hurting me! No!

33:02.125 --> 33:03.125
(grunts)
Get in!

33:03.208 --> 33:04.291
(Sara grunts)

33:05.041 --> 33:05.916
TAMSIN: Back!

33:09.750 --> 33:11.458
No!

33:11.541 --> 33:12.916
Stop!

33:13.500 --> 33:15.916
-Stop!
-TAMSIN: Get down!

33:16.000 --> 33:17.916
(grunts, pants)

33:18.000 --> 33:21.958
Don't you ever disrespect Maitreya again.

33:22.041 --> 33:25.333
No! No.

33:25.416 --> 33:26.875
SARA: No, let me out!

33:26.958 --> 33:28.791
Don't leave me here.

33:28.875 --> 33:30.458
No!

33:30.541 --> 33:32.166
-I want my mom!
-(Tamsin panting)

33:32.250 --> 33:33.833
SARA (shouting): Let me out of here!

33:34.541 --> 33:36.166
Help me!
(banging on trapdoor)

33:36.416 --> 33:37.625
Help!

33:39.208 --> 33:41.458
Don't leave me here.

33:41.541 --> 33:42.916
No!

33:44.666 --> 33:46.250
No!

33:49.875 --> 33:51.291
(telephone ringing)

33:51.916 --> 33:54.125
(indistinct chatter in distance)

34:00.041 --> 34:01.500
COLIN: Mate, you're drawing a long bow

34:01.583 --> 34:03.458
if you think they're connected
to the missing kid.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.125
You reckon?

34:06.333 --> 34:09.333
(grunts softly)
Come on. Let's grab a beer.

34:10.916 --> 34:13.083
-My shout.
-JOE: You go, then.

34:15.916 --> 34:16.833
If I find something,

34:16.916 --> 34:18.666
Wilkes will have to approve
a search warrant.

34:19.833 --> 34:24.625
We get into Blackmarsh,
we find Sara McFetridge.

34:26.375 --> 34:28.666
(keyboard clacking)

34:30.166 --> 34:31.708
COLIN: See you down there.

34:38.041 --> 34:40.250
(suspenseful music playing)

34:42.083 --> 34:44.083
(door creaks open)

34:48.625 --> 34:50.625
(door closes)

34:56.708 --> 34:57.958
ADRIENNE: Forgive me, Amy.

34:58.958 --> 35:01.666
I put too much responsibility on you.

35:02.541 --> 35:05.375
I expected you to behave like a grown-up.

35:06.916 --> 35:08.708
To be Asha's teacher,

35:10.541 --> 35:13.291
when you're only a child yourself.

35:15.666 --> 35:17.833
How could I not have realized this?

35:25.625 --> 35:27.208
Do you want to grow up, Amy?

35:35.041 --> 35:40.500
You are my oldest daughter,
the heir to everything that is mine.

35:41.916 --> 35:47.166
It is you who must carry on The Kindred
when I am no longer able.

35:48.708 --> 35:53.208
But to do that, you must be initiated.

35:55.666 --> 35:57.416
Are you ready for your Clearing?

35:58.750 --> 35:59.958
Yes.

36:01.458 --> 36:06.625
In order to go through,
you must be cleared of all your sins.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.875
That takes great courage.

36:12.375 --> 36:14.250
ADRIENNE: Do you have that, Amy?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.750
Yes. Yes, I do.

36:21.500 --> 36:22.875
Then you are ready.

36:37.875 --> 36:39.208
Open your mouth.

36:57.458 --> 36:58.708
(Adrienne sighs)

37:02.541 --> 37:05.125
ADRIENNE:
The light shines brightest on you, Amy,

37:06.083 --> 37:08.583
because you are the chosen one.

37:10.125 --> 37:12.166
(suspenseful music playing)

37:40.666 --> 37:42.958
(fire crackles)

37:58.833 --> 38:03.208
(breathe shakily)

38:07.625 --> 38:09.833
(gasping)

38:20.875 --> 38:22.291
SARA: Help!

38:22.375 --> 38:23.375
Let me out!

38:23.458 --> 38:25.250
Amy!

38:25.791 --> 38:29.291
-Amy!
-(eerie music playing)

38:36.750 --> 38:38.958
(grunts, whimpering)

38:39.458 --> 38:40.916
(Sara screaming)
Help!

38:42.250 --> 38:44.250
(panting)

38:47.333 --> 38:49.750
(distorted voice in distance)

38:53.125 --> 38:55.208
-ADRIENNE: I know you won't disappoint me.
-(Amy whimpering)

38:55.291 --> 38:57.875
-SARA: Amy! Amy!
-Let me out, please!

38:58.166 --> 38:59.500
-(Sara grunts)
-(banging)

39:04.750 --> 39:05.916
(yelps)

39:06.000 --> 39:09.708
You'll never go through
if you let fear overtake you, Amy.

39:09.791 --> 39:12.000
(breathing heavily)

39:13.708 --> 39:16.333
(Sara grunting)

39:17.958 --> 39:19.875
ADRIENNE: The light shines on you, Amy.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.583
(music box tinkling)

39:23.666 --> 39:25.791
Did you betray your family?

39:27.416 --> 39:28.541
SARA: Help!

39:30.541 --> 39:31.791
Help.

39:31.875 --> 39:34.500
Amy, help me!

39:34.583 --> 39:36.625
ADRIENNE:
You're not working hard enough, Amy.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.875
You're not working hard enough, Amy.

39:38.958 --> 39:40.958
(Amy sobbing)

39:42.666 --> 39:45.291
(Amy mumbling)

39:46.791 --> 39:49.708
-(screaming)
-Amy!

39:52.916 --> 39:54.833
SARA: My name is Sara.

39:54.916 --> 39:57.000
(panting)

39:57.291 --> 39:58.958
SARA: Amy, help me!

39:59.916 --> 40:01.916
(sobbing)

40:06.916 --> 40:08.000
Leave me alone!

40:08.083 --> 40:10.208
I wanna go home!

40:10.291 --> 40:12.708
(grunting)

40:18.166 --> 40:20.958
(panting)

40:23.375 --> 40:26.208
(sobbing)

40:39.791 --> 40:42.208
(indistinct chatter in distance)

41:01.416 --> 41:03.791
SARA: Help.
(echoing)

41:11.041 --> 41:13.666
(ominous music playing)

41:38.166 --> 41:41.666
SARA: Amy, help me!
(echoing)

41:45.750 --> 41:47.958
(birds chirping)

41:57.041 --> 42:02.208
I want to go home!
I hate this place and I hate you all!

42:04.416 --> 42:06.416
(foreboding music playing)

42:20.000 --> 42:21.208
Where's Asha?

42:26.125 --> 42:28.583
Where do you think she is, Amy?

42:31.375 --> 42:32.500
I don't know.

42:34.333 --> 42:36.125
BRYCE: You have no idea?

42:39.166 --> 42:40.125
No.

42:42.750 --> 42:43.875
She's gone home.

42:47.083 --> 42:48.416
You let her go?

42:49.166 --> 42:51.458
She didn't belong here.
She was never one of us.

42:54.541 --> 42:55.500
I'm sorry.

42:57.708 --> 43:01.125
I failed. I can try harder.

43:07.083 --> 43:09.583
(breathes shakily)

43:14.041 --> 43:16.666
(somber music playing)

43:42.541 --> 43:44.166
(inhales deeply)

43:44.250 --> 43:45.666
(exhales deeply)

43:53.666 --> 43:55.875
(cell phone ringing)

44:04.916 --> 44:07.125
(ringing continues)

44:09.000 --> 44:09.916
Hello?

44:10.500 --> 44:13.500
Amy, it's Wayne. Please don't hang up.

44:14.083 --> 44:15.666
How did you get this number?

44:15.750 --> 44:17.750
Look, just hear me out, okay?

44:17.833 --> 44:19.458
(line beeps)

44:26.541 --> 44:29.375
AUTOMATED VOICE: The number
you have called is not available.

44:30.416 --> 44:31.416
Fuck.

44:31.500 --> 44:33.250
(car engine ignites)

44:33.333 --> 44:34.833
(cell phone ringing)

44:39.416 --> 44:40.250
Freya.

44:40.333 --> 44:42.208
FREYA (over phone):
You gave Wayne my number.

44:43.166 --> 44:44.916
Yeah, he needed to speak to you.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.416
Whatever Wayne needs, nothing's changed.
You want him to take Billy?

44:48.500 --> 44:49.541
-What?
-Is that it?

44:49.625 --> 44:51.875
(splutters)
Of course not. No.

44:51.958 --> 44:55.375
The black eye was an accident.
You were right there!

44:55.458 --> 44:57.875
Look, did you let him tell you
why he wanted...

44:57.958 --> 44:59.666
You have no right to interfere in my life.

44:59.750 --> 45:03.291
Look, I was just, I was just trying to do
what I thought was best for you.

45:03.375 --> 45:05.958
-I'm your mother, you understand...
-No, you are not.

45:11.291 --> 45:12.541
(car door opens)

45:13.250 --> 45:14.208
(car door closes)

45:20.541 --> 45:21.958
-Hello.
-WAYNE: Hey.

45:23.750 --> 45:27.041
Thanks for this, Chris.
Beats forking out for a motel.

45:27.125 --> 45:29.666
Of course. We're family. Come on.

45:32.458 --> 45:34.750
(Mo humming)

45:39.083 --> 45:40.916
-MO: Hello?
-Hey.

45:42.250 --> 45:43.916
Any jailbreaks today?

45:44.000 --> 45:47.375
Nope, but it is only midday.

45:48.541 --> 45:52.083
Did you want to take your break now?
I can... I can grab her lunch.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.083
Are you sure?

45:54.166 --> 45:55.583
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

46:02.166 --> 46:03.166
(door closes)

46:15.208 --> 46:16.291
FREYA: Wayne knows.

46:17.875 --> 46:20.250
Christine told him and now,
he's come to get Billy.

46:22.083 --> 46:23.416
He's been following us,

46:24.375 --> 46:26.458
talking to Billy at the school gate.

46:30.041 --> 46:31.500
He knows where we live.

46:35.833 --> 46:37.500
I can't let him do it again.

46:40.791 --> 46:42.041
If I lose Billy...

46:49.625 --> 46:51.458
Billy doesn't belong to Wayne.

46:55.750 --> 46:57.958
(somber music playing)

46:58.041 --> 47:01.000
Losing a child is the greatest pain
a mother can bear.

47:02.791 --> 47:05.166
ADRIENNE:
And we know that more than anyone.

47:07.791 --> 47:10.833
Wayne will never take Billy from you, Amy.

47:12.666 --> 47:14.416
I promise.

47:14.500 --> 47:16.500
(somber music continues playing)

47:20.000 --> 47:20.916
Thank you.

47:25.708 --> 47:28.958
Now, make me a gin and tonic
before what's-his-name comes back.

47:30.125 --> 47:33.875
Can't stand the baby food
he shoves down my throat.

47:34.333 --> 47:36.833
-(scoffs)
-His name's Mohamed.

47:40.208 --> 47:41.333
(door opens)

47:42.291 --> 47:43.583
(door closes)

47:46.750 --> 47:47.916
(beeps)

47:52.041 --> 47:53.666
(birds chirping)

47:53.750 --> 47:56.166
(indistinct chatter in distance)

48:10.000 --> 48:11.333
(cell phone vibrates)

48:11.416 --> 48:13.333
(ominous music playing)

48:13.416 --> 48:15.375
Are you here, my darling?

48:18.500 --> 48:20.458
WOMAN: Yeah, I'm here.

48:23.500 --> 48:25.916
(ominous music intensifies)

48:30.958 --> 48:32.958
(closing theme music playing)
