WEBVTT

00:03.458 --> 00:05.416
Fury, I'd like you to meet someone.

00:06.916 --> 00:07.916
This is Gravik.

00:13.333 --> 00:14.583
Gravik?

00:14.916 --> 00:16.125
G'IAH: <i>You don't trust me.</i>

00:18.541 --> 00:21.291
You're telling me
there's a million Skrulls

00:21.416 --> 00:23.125
walking amongst us right now?

00:23.125 --> 00:26.166
Have you lost your reptilian-ass mind?

00:27.875 --> 00:30.583
<i>Skrulls have infiltrated the ranks
of major world powers.</i>

00:30.583 --> 00:31.708
<i>Where is the proof?</i>

00:31.708 --> 00:34.791
I nominate Gravik
to the post of Skrull General.

00:35.708 --> 00:38.083
They sent you to fire me?

00:38.083 --> 00:39.333
I volunteered.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.125
Set up a meet between me and Gravik.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.458
Talos, he will kill you.

00:42.458 --> 00:44.250
I wanna talk about my daughter.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.666
Everyone ready?
Uh-huh.

01:17.625 --> 01:19.041
Do you think it'll work?

01:21.791 --> 01:23.166
I mean, uh...

01:23.166 --> 01:24.666
Bringing chaos?

01:28.125 --> 01:30.333
Why did you join the resistance, Beto?

01:32.541 --> 01:33.666
Um...

01:34.500 --> 01:36.750
I did not want our people to keep running.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.666
You joined the same reason I did.

01:48.750 --> 01:53.000
Not fear of the past, faith in our future.

01:54.916 --> 01:58.291
All faith is built on risk.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.791
So that's what we have to take. Yeah?

02:06.125 --> 02:07.416
Yeah.

03:05.416 --> 03:06.416
Ah!

03:07.291 --> 03:08.833
Members of the Council.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.791
Glad you could make it on short notice.

03:14.375 --> 03:15.583
Now at the council meeting,

03:15.583 --> 03:18.375
I told you I had a plan
for taking Earth as our own.

03:19.083 --> 03:22.041
<i>I sent three operatives
to infiltrate the Royal Navy.</i>

03:22.708 --> 03:24.166
Time to change.

03:25.791 --> 03:29.125
<i>And execute a strike
on a key United Nations target.</i>

03:33.208 --> 03:35.666
<i>The heroes of Earth will react.</i>

03:37.375 --> 03:40.333
<i>The only way we can counter that
and claim this planet as our home</i>

03:41.375 --> 03:43.375
<i>is to become super ourselves.</i>

03:44.416 --> 03:46.583
Now, we no longer just change faces.

03:47.583 --> 03:48.875
We change powers.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.250
We're gonna be uniquely programmed
weapons of mass destruction.

03:54.333 --> 03:55.416
All of us.

03:57.041 --> 03:58.166
Super Skrulls.

03:59.416 --> 04:02.666
<i>Humans will be at all-out war
with each other within the week.</i>

04:03.333 --> 04:07.000
<i>And while they're at each other's throats,
we're gonna break their backs.</i>

04:10.625 --> 04:14.958
<i>I invite you to join me
in the extinction of the human race.</i>

06:43.833 --> 06:45.750
Coffee?

06:46.500 --> 06:47.750
Yes, please, black.

06:54.958 --> 06:56.291
Looking for someone?

06:58.541 --> 06:59.541
Uh, yes, I am.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.541
What does she look like?

07:04.166 --> 07:06.458
That depends
on what day of the week it is.

07:09.875 --> 07:11.625
Wanna sit here while you wait?

07:14.625 --> 07:17.166
Well... That...

07:18.666 --> 07:20.708
That might send the wrong message.

07:22.708 --> 07:23.958
She won't mind.

07:27.916 --> 07:29.458
Varra?

07:32.750 --> 07:35.750
This should put Dreykov's men
on their heels.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.083
Looks like you already have.

07:45.958 --> 07:48.416
This new face of yours is...

07:49.083 --> 07:50.125
Beautiful?

07:53.750 --> 07:54.875
I agree.

07:57.375 --> 07:58.541
Who is she?

07:59.333 --> 08:01.083
Well, that depends on where this goes.

08:01.083 --> 08:02.458
No, no, no, no, no.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.958
There's a rule that, you know,

08:03.958 --> 08:06.333
commander of station
and operatives cannot be...

08:06.333 --> 08:08.458
Our unit doesn't exist, Fury.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.500
That means I don't work for you.

08:14.166 --> 08:17.000
Well, that's an intriguing possibility.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.916
<i>Does anyone out there
seriously trust our leaders?</i>

08:24.916 --> 08:26.083
<i>I sure don't.</i>

08:26.083 --> 08:28.791
<i>Load your guns and make sure
you got enough food and water</i>

08:28.916 --> 08:32.625
<i>because that, my friends,
looks a hell of a lot like World War III.</i>

08:33.625 --> 08:35.625
How can you watch that poison?

08:35.625 --> 08:38.083
Even a broken clock's right twice a day.

08:38.083 --> 08:40.125
Good morning.

08:40.125 --> 08:41.458
Morning!

08:45.250 --> 08:46.250
Mmm! Mmm!

08:46.250 --> 08:49.625
Those eggs supposed to be soft
or hard boiled?

08:50.250 --> 08:51.500
Poached.

08:54.250 --> 08:57.458
I forgot.
Things cook differently up in space.

08:59.958 --> 09:02.000
Whoa. Thank you.

09:04.166 --> 09:07.541
Do I dare ask what calamity
must have transpired

09:07.541 --> 09:09.541
to bring you home, to me?

09:10.666 --> 09:12.625
It has been years.

09:13.875 --> 09:17.666
If you want me to apologize
for being gone, Scilla, just say so.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.958
Darling, you are Nick Fury.

09:20.750 --> 09:25.250
I never harbored any illusions
about the necessity of you going away.

09:26.625 --> 09:28.125
But staying away,

09:28.666 --> 09:30.041
that leaves a mark.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.791
I retired.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.125
Any plans for the downtime?

09:44.875 --> 09:47.333
Well, you know,
I never cared much for golf, so...

09:48.541 --> 09:52.041
I'm thinking I may take up revenge.

09:59.458 --> 10:02.208
You been in touch with Gravik
while I was gone?

10:03.750 --> 10:06.916
- And why are you asking me that?
- 'Cause I just need to be sure.

10:06.916 --> 10:08.333
About what?

10:09.375 --> 10:10.708
Who you've become

10:13.083 --> 10:14.375
while I was gone.

10:15.125 --> 10:17.916
I became a widow in your absence.

10:19.458 --> 10:22.833
I wept on your pillow every night.
I grieved for you.

10:24.666 --> 10:27.750
And just when I thought
I had gotten past the heartbreak,

10:28.250 --> 10:29.708
you came back in the Blip.

10:30.791 --> 10:34.208
And silly me, I thought we were
going to undo all the pain together.

10:35.833 --> 10:38.375
Go back to the way we were, but no,

10:40.583 --> 10:42.583
you just up and vanished again.

10:42.833 --> 10:45.000
Only this time it was voluntary.

10:46.416 --> 10:51.916
So if you're interested in who I became
in your second absence,

10:52.833 --> 10:54.166
I became me.

10:55.875 --> 10:57.500
The me I was before you.

10:58.916 --> 11:01.875
What other choice was there
when you kept disappearing

11:01.875 --> 11:04.541
as if you were never really here
in the first place?

11:11.833 --> 11:13.458
Don't ignore it because of me.

11:22.375 --> 11:25.166
I don't have that information
at hand right now.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.541
You too, take care.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.333
Something important?

11:32.791 --> 11:33.791
Nope.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.625
What is it? What's happened?

12:08.291 --> 12:09.291
Brogan.

12:12.458 --> 12:13.666
What about him?

12:14.166 --> 12:18.208
Well, someone told the cops
where we were headed,

12:19.458 --> 12:20.750
and only we knew that.

12:21.208 --> 12:25.000
It was me, you, Pagon and Beto in the car.

12:26.541 --> 12:29.541
It's hard for Brogan to confess
to something he didn't know.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.625
Not so hard.

12:33.125 --> 12:34.125
Oh, yeah?

12:34.666 --> 12:35.708
How'd you figure?

12:36.666 --> 12:38.333
Brogan under torture.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.833
I'd imagine when they asked him
where they could find you,

12:44.833 --> 12:47.875
he was forced to make an educated guess.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.416
Is that what you'd do?

12:53.541 --> 12:54.583
I'd lie.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.583
I'm a good liar.

12:59.333 --> 13:00.375
Okay.

13:03.875 --> 13:05.166
It was Brogan.

13:05.958 --> 13:07.583
He was weaker than you thought.

13:20.666 --> 13:21.708
All right.

13:24.041 --> 13:25.625
See you tomorrow. Early.

13:26.333 --> 13:27.458
You're coming with me.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.041
Your father called for a parley.

14:03.083 --> 14:05.000
Apparently we're meeting about you.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Yeah.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.833
Right on schedule.

14:21.125 --> 14:25.416
The UN plane will be
at <i>Neptune's</i> coordinates, 2200 hours.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.750
It's remarkable, innit?

15:13.166 --> 15:16.500
Gathering up all these big men
for one painting.

15:17.750 --> 15:22.208
<i>Statesmen of World War I.</i>
That's what it's called.

15:22.208 --> 15:25.375
I mean, it just sums up the whole thing
pretty nice, I'd say.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.666
Which whole thing is that?

15:28.291 --> 15:32.625
You know, the difference
between statesmen and soldiers.

15:32.958 --> 15:36.000
You see, 'cause one lot spends the war
posing for pictures,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.916
while the other does all the killing

15:38.333 --> 15:39.333
and the dying.

15:39.333 --> 15:42.208
I mean, look at the fat
smug smile on his face.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.291
You ask me, Talos,

15:44.291 --> 15:48.291
choice between having my story told
in ink and oil paint

15:48.791 --> 15:50.666
or having it written in blood,

15:51.333 --> 15:55.500
I choose blood all day long.

15:56.583 --> 15:59.500
Yours and everyone else's. Huh?

16:00.333 --> 16:01.500
Yeah.

16:01.875 --> 16:02.916
Brave.

16:03.416 --> 16:05.875
You asked for parley,
so let's parley, shall we?

16:05.875 --> 16:07.208
Come on.

16:17.375 --> 16:18.583
Thank you, love.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.750
Why don't you just get an empty cup?

16:39.166 --> 16:41.416
I like a little bit of espresso
with my sugar.

16:43.083 --> 16:44.250
You want some?

16:44.875 --> 16:49.000
What I want is for you to stand down
and stop murdering innocent humans.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.708
You know, I would be doing us both a favor

16:51.958 --> 16:54.500
if I just put you
out of your misery right here.

16:55.541 --> 16:58.375
You want an honor meeting?
Mate, go ahead, say the word.

16:58.916 --> 16:59.916
An honor meeting?

17:00.416 --> 17:02.375
Well, it wouldn't be proper, would it?

17:02.500 --> 17:04.666
A general challenging his subordinate
to knives.

17:05.666 --> 17:07.875
Are you honestly puzzled
as to why the Council

17:07.875 --> 17:10.208
would prefer me as general
over the likes of you?

17:10.333 --> 17:13.000
G'iah's in the car. Wanna come say hello?

17:13.416 --> 17:17.166
You wanna be very, very careful now.

17:17.791 --> 17:18.916
You should be grateful

17:18.916 --> 17:21.791
that I haven't sent her back to you
in a body bag yet.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.500
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

17:48.500 --> 17:51.875
You're gonna take our people
to the edge of extinction

17:51.875 --> 17:53.208
with the war with the humans.

17:53.208 --> 17:55.166
All these miscreants know

17:56.500 --> 17:57.625
is murder.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.083
Look how they treat each other.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.625
That's what's gonna happen.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.000
We're gonna murder them all.

18:05.416 --> 18:09.583
You don't understand
the first thing about humans.

18:11.541 --> 18:14.000
They're at their most formidable

18:15.291 --> 18:16.875
when they're threatened

18:18.625 --> 18:20.416
by a common foe.

18:21.083 --> 18:22.500
Have you forgotten how we fight?

18:22.500 --> 18:23.708
You think I'll let you

18:23.708 --> 18:27.166
continue this war
under the cover of anonymity,

18:27.166 --> 18:28.583
you're very much mistaken.

18:28.583 --> 18:32.000
I'm gonna tell every army on Earth
who it is that's attacking them.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.916
You'll lose the element of surprise.

18:33.916 --> 18:37.291
You and your rebels will be put down
like the rabid dogs you are.

18:37.291 --> 18:40.000
Then you'll be the author
of our people's extermination.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And that's where you're wrong,
because you see,

18:42.125 --> 18:45.875
they will see the difference between us

18:45.875 --> 18:48.291
because we will show them,

18:48.416 --> 18:53.291
we who haven't been infected
by your sickness.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.125
So, then, G'iah stays with me then, is it?

18:59.375 --> 19:02.541
Now, until the end of time,

19:03.208 --> 19:05.416
my daughter's name
stays out of your mouth.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.041
You got it?

19:31.250 --> 19:32.875
- I'm sorry.
- No, I am.

19:34.458 --> 19:37.916
- I believe this is yours.
- Thank you.

20:41.666 --> 20:43.875
You really gonna eat
that plate of dog food?

20:47.333 --> 20:49.916
I was, mate. I just lost my appetite.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.291
Oh, that's a first.

20:54.666 --> 20:56.833
You really are shameless, aren't you?

20:57.250 --> 21:00.083
Anyone that could say
what you said to me yesterday,

21:00.875 --> 21:03.833
have the balls to come up in here
and ask me for help?

21:03.833 --> 21:05.291
I didn't ask you for help.

21:05.708 --> 21:08.041
What, are you here to have
an English breakfast, mate,

21:08.041 --> 21:10.541
or are you here to inquire
after my well-being?

21:10.541 --> 21:13.958
No, I think it's a pretty safe bet
you ain't here for that, right? Hmm?

21:13.958 --> 21:15.791
Look, look, look, look.

21:15.916 --> 21:19.875
I got a lead on a rebel Skrull
that's high up in the U.S. government,

21:19.875 --> 21:22.291
- and he's in London right now.
- And?

21:22.625 --> 21:23.833
And?

21:23.833 --> 21:26.250
Yeah, and what can I do for you?

21:26.541 --> 21:28.125
How can I help you, my friend?

21:28.958 --> 21:30.125
I just told you.

21:30.125 --> 21:31.416
No, you told me

21:31.416 --> 21:35.041
that you've got a line on a Skrull
that's up in the U.S. government and...

21:35.041 --> 21:38.875
That it's understood
that you think that implies

21:38.875 --> 21:41.208
that I should just sort of leap up

21:41.208 --> 21:43.750
and take this opportunity
to just help you, like that.

21:44.166 --> 21:50.125
Those days are gone, so I'm gonna
need you to, you know, use your words.

21:50.916 --> 21:52.291
Say the words.

21:53.291 --> 21:54.916
Say what words?

21:56.916 --> 21:58.166
"Help me, Talos,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.166
"'cause I'm useless without you."

22:21.666 --> 22:23.500
Help me, Talos,

22:23.916 --> 22:26.625
'cause I am useless without you.

22:42.666 --> 22:45.000
G'iah handed off intel,
used a burner phone.

22:45.666 --> 22:46.916
Brave girl.

22:47.375 --> 22:49.583
Yeah. Her mum. Good role model.

22:51.375 --> 22:54.125
<i>Neptune</i> is a British sub.
I know who to call.

22:59.083 --> 23:01.250
Whoever this is,
you shouldn't have this number.

23:01.250 --> 23:04.333
<i>What do you know about
a British submarine called</i> Neptune?

23:04.458 --> 23:06.000
First, I want an apology.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.291
<i>I just gave away
the only one of those I had today.</i>

23:08.291 --> 23:10.208
Well, you'll have to double down,

23:10.208 --> 23:14.916
'cause you rather rudely attached
a nasty bug to my beloved Hoot.

23:14.916 --> 23:16.916
<i>Tell me that's not the name
of that owl clock.</i>

23:17.041 --> 23:20.250
No, not anymore. Has a new name now.
Nicholas Fury.

23:20.916 --> 23:23.208
He has a rather
dashing little eye patch now.

23:23.625 --> 23:26.166
<i>I'm serious, Sonya.
I have it on good authority.</i>

23:26.166 --> 23:28.833
Neptune <i>is planning to launch
on the UN Delegation.</i>

23:28.833 --> 23:30.791
<i>That would mean World War III.</i>

23:31.333 --> 23:33.833
<i>Well, why would they
do something silly like that?</i>

23:34.208 --> 23:37.208
Because at least one of Gravik's rebels
has infiltrated Command.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.333
<i>Can you make the call?</i>

23:38.333 --> 23:40.625
Unfortunately,
I'm dealing with my own infiltration

23:40.625 --> 23:42.041
at the moment.

23:42.041 --> 23:44.291
Somebody leaked the location
of the butcher's shop

23:44.291 --> 23:47.208
when I was doing some of my best work,
so my hands are tied.

23:47.333 --> 23:49.000
<i>Loose enough to get the captain's name?</i>

23:49.500 --> 23:52.791
<i>- His name is Commodore Robert Fairbanks.</i>
- Bob!

23:52.791 --> 23:55.208
- Can I get a photo and address?
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

23:55.208 --> 23:58.041
<i>- Shall I tell him you're on your way?</i>
- Yeah. Tell him that.

24:05.083 --> 24:06.083
Portsmouth.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.208
That's where Naval Command HQ is.

24:14.916 --> 24:19.083
You know what?
I don't get the whole dog thing.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.208
What's to get?
Dogs are man's best friend.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.458
But I mean, come on, look at that.

24:25.958 --> 24:29.875
I mean, just name me
one other interspecies relationship

24:29.875 --> 24:33.541
where it's acceptable
to clean up the other guy's poop.

24:34.208 --> 24:37.208
I've been cleaning up your poop
for the last 30-some years.

24:38.625 --> 24:39.833
Oh, that's rich.

24:39.833 --> 24:42.791
Ah, the truth's a mother dog, right?

24:46.458 --> 24:48.208
That's really what you think?

24:48.208 --> 24:50.500
That the whole time
we've known each other,

24:50.500 --> 24:52.458
you've been cleaning up my mess?

24:52.458 --> 24:55.250
- You got a different take on it?
- Oh, well, let's see.

24:55.625 --> 24:57.416
When I came here in 1995,

24:57.416 --> 25:01.875
you were just a benchwarming nobody
in a dumpy field office in S.H.I.E.L.D.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.041
Benchwarming?

25:03.208 --> 25:05.458
What, do you have
a different take on this?

25:05.958 --> 25:08.208
I was ascending the ranks.

25:08.958 --> 25:12.041
You didn't start ascending the ranks

25:12.041 --> 25:17.750
until me and 19 of my people
signed on as your invisible spy network.

25:18.166 --> 25:22.000
You know, we fed you more dirt and intel

25:22.208 --> 25:26.500
than you could've uncovered
on your own in a lifetime, so please.

25:26.708 --> 25:31.166
I mean, every time you were promoted
inside S.H.I.E.L.D., we did that.

25:31.916 --> 25:35.458
Every terror attack you prevented,
we did that.

25:36.041 --> 25:40.583
Every enemy you sabotaged
and ally you leveraged with dirt

25:40.583 --> 25:44.208
no one else in the world had access to,
we did that.

25:45.458 --> 25:49.291
You're a smart and capable guy, Fury.
Nobody questions that.

25:49.958 --> 25:51.375
But you've gotta admit,

25:51.916 --> 25:55.250
your life got a hell of a lot more charmed
once I came into it.

25:55.541 --> 25:57.000
And do you know something?

25:57.375 --> 26:00.250
I don't even need to hear
a bloody thank you from you.

26:00.916 --> 26:02.291
It was my pleasure, mate.

26:03.291 --> 26:04.416
Least you can do

26:05.708 --> 26:07.291
is not rewrite history

26:07.625 --> 26:10.875
when the guy who helped write it
with you the first time

26:11.208 --> 26:12.708
is sitting right next to you.

26:13.791 --> 26:16.041
- What'd you stop for?
- We're here.

26:16.958 --> 26:18.166
- At Bob's?
- Yeah, Bob.

26:18.291 --> 26:20.708
Remember Bob?
The guy that'll launch a nuclear attack?

26:20.708 --> 26:22.708
All right, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that.

26:22.708 --> 26:26.750
No, that's 'cause you were too busy
riding the "we did that" wave.

26:27.333 --> 26:29.458
You got any more abuse
you wanna hurl my way?

26:29.458 --> 26:32.250
Or are you ready to go in here
and take care of Bob?

26:32.250 --> 26:35.166
And then I get to say, "We did that."

26:36.583 --> 26:37.750
We can do that.

26:47.166 --> 26:48.166
Sir.

26:48.791 --> 26:50.708
Sorry. I didn't know you stepped out.

26:50.708 --> 26:53.416
I needed a break
from the old ball and chain.

26:53.416 --> 26:54.666
I can empathize, sir.

26:55.166 --> 26:56.791
Don't let her hear you say that.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.750
<i>You in position?</i>

27:05.750 --> 27:07.708
Worry about your own damn self.

27:08.416 --> 27:10.041
<i>Do me a favor, Fury.</i>

27:10.708 --> 27:11.791
Don't ever change.

27:14.916 --> 27:17.041
- Sir, I just left you...
- Shit.

27:22.333 --> 27:24.375
<i>I'm blown.</i>
- Yeah, I see.

27:55.291 --> 27:56.375
Come in, Talos.

27:56.916 --> 28:00.458
<i>Sorry, Nick.
I was busy kicking Bob's ass.</i>

28:00.625 --> 28:03.083
<i>Second floor. Last door down the hall.</i>

28:03.708 --> 28:04.750
Copy that.

28:21.291 --> 28:24.625
Nobody calls me Nick, Bob.

28:25.083 --> 28:26.416
Zachary.

28:27.875 --> 28:28.875
Dad?

28:33.666 --> 28:34.708
Daddy?

28:35.791 --> 28:38.625
I'll let him go when you let my son go.

28:39.291 --> 28:42.333
This is not a negotiation, Bob.

28:56.291 --> 28:57.583
Find something to tie them up?

28:58.541 --> 29:00.000
Sure thing, boss.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.125
"Thanks for saving my life, Fury."

29:03.416 --> 29:05.458
"No problem, Talos. Any time."

29:06.916 --> 29:09.250
What you working on over there, Bob?

29:21.208 --> 29:24.500
Forty-five degrees right.
...to four zero feet.

29:25.166 --> 29:27.875
Standby. Uh, ready one.

29:28.791 --> 29:30.583
This has to be a mistake.

29:31.583 --> 29:35.166
The message has been authenticated,
Captain. You are obliged to strike.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.125
I'm at a 50 mile radius.

29:44.166 --> 29:49.291
Here you go. Take a sip of this.
It's gonna help calm your nerves. Come on.

29:52.208 --> 29:53.916
Are you gonna kill my dad?

29:55.291 --> 29:58.250
I just need your dad
to do the right thing. Come on.

30:10.541 --> 30:13.250
I can't seem to get old Bob here
to listen to reason.

30:14.291 --> 30:15.625
So I'm gonna switch gears.

30:16.708 --> 30:17.833
Don't look at him.

30:17.833 --> 30:19.875
He's not the one
who's gonna have your wife

30:19.875 --> 30:23.333
scraping your purple goopy brains
out of her carpet.

30:23.333 --> 30:27.583
Unless you call off the airstrike now.

30:27.583 --> 30:31.208
And if you're afraid
of going against Gravik,

30:32.250 --> 30:33.291
I can protect you.

30:33.791 --> 30:36.583
You couldn't protect yourself
coming through that door.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.583
You're a shell
of the general you used to be.

30:41.250 --> 30:42.625
Just wait outside?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.375
Why don't you shapeshift back
into this piece of trash

30:45.375 --> 30:47.625
and call in an abort
on that missile strike?

30:47.625 --> 30:49.791
Great idea. Why didn't I think of that?

30:50.208 --> 30:54.333
Maybe 'cause he's the only one
who knows the code word.

30:54.333 --> 30:55.875
You got a code for us, Commodore?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.750
You created this vacuum.
All Gravik did is fill it.

30:59.041 --> 31:00.416
I want to talk to Cent Com.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
These are Cent Com's orders.

31:03.458 --> 31:06.166
Either you obey or you'll be removed.

31:06.166 --> 31:07.458
Do you understand?

31:08.708 --> 31:10.291
You could've led together.

31:10.291 --> 31:14.458
Gravik offered you a partnership.
We would have stood by you proudly.

31:14.458 --> 31:16.416
So stand with me now.

31:16.416 --> 31:17.500
You're too late.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.833
Enough of this bull!

31:20.375 --> 31:22.041
I'm giving you three seconds

31:22.041 --> 31:24.375
to give me that code,
or I'm gonna aim higher,

31:24.375 --> 31:25.916
or maybe lower.

31:25.916 --> 31:27.000
- Give me the gun.
- One!

31:27.125 --> 31:28.458
- Give me the...
- Two!

31:28.458 --> 31:29.750
I said give me that gun!

31:29.750 --> 31:33.791
You got minutes to figure out that code
if we can't make your friend here tell us.

31:50.916 --> 31:51.916
Prepare to launch.

31:53.875 --> 31:55.916
Getting close
to showtime here, Talos.

31:56.875 --> 31:58.416
Traitors like you are the reason

31:58.416 --> 32:01.750
people have been walking in exile
for 30 years.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.000
- You sicken me.
- Shut up!

32:04.000 --> 32:05.666
What's it gonna be, man?

32:07.041 --> 32:09.458
You can't even keep
your daughter's loyalty.

32:10.833 --> 32:13.958
Or is she the spineless traitor
feeding you information?

32:44.458 --> 32:45.458
G'IAH: <i>What is it?</i>

32:45.708 --> 32:47.291
Commodore Robert Fairbanks.

32:47.291 --> 32:50.583
<i>I need his
launch termination password now.</i>

33:06.583 --> 33:09.791
- Good evening, friends.
- Operative G'iah. What can we do for you?

33:12.458 --> 33:14.208
<i>Initiate go position.</i>

33:59.291 --> 34:00.500
You got it?

34:02.250 --> 34:03.791
Okay. Now run.

34:11.833 --> 34:13.333
Initiating go position.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.875
Initiating go position.

34:20.541 --> 34:22.416
<i>Launch sequence underway.</i>

34:25.583 --> 34:26.916
This is Fairbanks.

34:28.916 --> 34:31.375
Abort exercise.

34:32.416 --> 34:34.916
Code word, Zachary.

34:36.750 --> 34:38.125
<i>Abort launch.</i>

34:39.041 --> 34:40.416
<i>Abort launch.</i>

35:06.541 --> 35:09.333
So, why didn't you take the deal?
- What deal?

35:09.958 --> 35:11.041
Gravik's.

35:11.166 --> 35:13.125
Gotta be hard for you
to be fighting with him

35:13.125 --> 35:16.291
when deep down in your bones
you believe in what he's doing.

35:17.041 --> 35:20.250
Shit. Thirty years,
you still don't know me better than that?

35:24.166 --> 35:26.750
All right, so make me understand.

35:28.958 --> 35:31.583
I'm not with Gravik 'cause I'm with you.

36:09.583 --> 36:11.291
Where are you off to, G'iah?

36:12.333 --> 36:13.791
I heard about the failed strike.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.916
Our men need exfiltration.

36:16.833 --> 36:17.875
I didn't fail.

36:19.291 --> 36:20.916
That plane would have been valuable.

36:21.500 --> 36:24.208
Finding the traitor was essential.

36:27.791 --> 36:29.125
Go on, turn around.

36:30.416 --> 36:31.416
No.

36:33.291 --> 36:34.541
You will look at me.

36:35.500 --> 36:36.875
And you'll ask yourself,

36:38.833 --> 36:40.583
are you a leader of Skrulls

36:41.583 --> 36:42.583
or our worst enemy?

37:41.708 --> 37:45.458
<i>Platform 17 for the 16:42 to Teddington,</i>

37:45.458 --> 37:49.041
<i>calling at Vauxhall, Clapham Junction,
Earlsfield, Wimbledon.</i>

37:50.791 --> 37:52.583
<i>The National!</i>

38:16.500 --> 38:18.666
- I'll give you some time alone.
- Hmm.

38:50.083 --> 38:51.916
<i>St. James Church, one hour.</i>

38:52.750 --> 38:54.333
I need to speak to Gravik.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.875
<i>Yeah, well, you're talking to me.</i>
