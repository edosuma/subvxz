Previously on Angel:

00:03.129 --> 00:04.740
We've heard you do favors for Angel.

00:05.530 --> 00:08.130
That's all I know, man, I swear.

00:10.330 --> 00:12.650
The Host reads their souls,
senses their futures.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.359
He can only do it
when they sing karaoke.

00:15.730 --> 00:17.870
I wanna find those kids.
They don't have homes.

00:18.129 --> 00:21.780
If they're hunting vampires,
they'll get themselves killed.

00:23.530 --> 00:26.829
- You should have waited for me.
- We been waiting for months.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.530
Get dressed and get out.

00:40.929 --> 00:43.840
The next time I see you,
I will have to kill you.

00:45.729 --> 00:48.329
That night still haunts me.

00:49.329 --> 00:52.070
I'm ashamed of how I treated you.

00:52.929 --> 00:55.320
The way I used you.

00:56.530 --> 01:01.479
I took what I needed
and then I cast you aside.

01:02.530 --> 01:06.459
And that was wrong of me.
It was very wrong.

01:10.329 --> 01:12.010
He's reading!

01:13.329 --> 01:16.349
- I made some notes.
- I don't feel the sincerity here.

01:16.930 --> 01:19.840
- This was a waste of time.
- Friends don't need notes.

01:20.530 --> 01:23.760
We're not friends, Merl.
We barely even know each other.

01:24.129 --> 01:26.549
Not like you made
the effort either, is it?

01:27.129 --> 01:29.340
No. Let him go if he wants to.

01:29.530 --> 01:32.579
- You said you'd listen to Angel.
- You promised you'd try.

01:33.129 --> 01:36.920
- Did you hear that insincere tripe?
- It's unfair to blame the writing.

01:37.930 --> 01:40.420
- What does he want from me?
- What do I want?

01:40.930 --> 01:45.500
I'll tell you what I want. I want back
the three months I spent in therapy...

01:46.329 --> 01:48.859
...after being hung
upside down in a sewer.

01:49.329 --> 01:50.870
Angel, read the cards.

01:51.730 --> 01:55.280
No, he's.... He's right. He's right.

01:55.930 --> 01:59.370
Every time I went to Merl for
information, he came through.

02:00.129 --> 02:04.060
So I'll tell you what, Merl.
Take a shot. Take a shot, Merl.

02:04.329 --> 02:06.260
- Knock it off, guys!
- Come on.

02:06.730 --> 02:09.919
- You see this? He's goading.
- You know you want to.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.650
- Take a shot.
- Shameless with the goading.

02:12.729 --> 02:14.939
- Come on, Merl.
- Do you see this? Fine.

02:15.729 --> 02:17.030
Okay!

02:19.330 --> 02:21.500
Man, you did that on purpose.

02:21.729 --> 02:24.569
He knew that was gonna happen.
You tricked me.

02:25.330 --> 02:29.539
I'm sure Angel just forgot that demon
violence is impossible in Caritas.

02:30.129 --> 02:31.460
Yeah, I forgot.

02:31.930 --> 02:33.509
Yeah, whatever, okay.

02:33.729 --> 02:37.840
I'm done listening to this bloodsucker
and that goes for the rest of you.

02:39.129 --> 02:42.500
I never want to see
any of you ever again!

02:45.129 --> 02:47.900
Uh.... So who's giving me
a ride home?

02:54.729 --> 02:57.710
Thanks. I hope I didn't take you...

02:58.930 --> 03:00.819
...too far out of your way.

03:09.729 --> 03:11.590
What the...?

03:12.129 --> 03:14.520
No, no, no, no!.

04:12.009 --> 04:13.939
Hey, big brother.

04:16.209 --> 04:19.540
I was supposed to protect you.
You were my sister.

04:19.810 --> 04:21.629
I still am.

04:27.610 --> 04:29.149
Goodbye.

04:32.410 --> 04:34.269
Alonna!

04:48.610 --> 04:49.769
You made it.

04:50.410 --> 04:54.240
I called the hotel. Cordelia said
you were at Merl's. What is that?

04:54.610 --> 04:57.310
- That's Merl.
- Where's the rest of him?

05:02.410 --> 05:03.810
Nasty. What happened?

05:04.209 --> 05:08.529
I don't know. I came to give "sincere"
one more shot. Even brought doughnuts.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.060
But this is what I found.
We've ruled out suicide.

05:12.610 --> 05:15.519
Found some of his personal
papers and address book.

05:16.209 --> 05:19.189
Gunn, you're here. Good.

05:19.810 --> 05:24.129
You didn't notice anything odd
when you dropped Merl off, did you?

05:25.209 --> 05:26.930
Not really.

05:27.009 --> 05:31.079
We'll box these up, catalogue them
when we get back to the hotel.

05:31.810 --> 05:34.269
Hey, guys, what are we doing?

05:36.610 --> 05:40.160
- Examining the crime scene.
- I see that. What's our interest?

05:40.810 --> 05:43.860
- Someone killed Merl.
- No, right, I get that.

05:44.410 --> 05:47.819
I didn't have a beef with Merl.
I'm even sorry he got dead.

05:48.610 --> 05:52.470
But is this what we should spend
our time on? He was what he was.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.129
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

05:55.810 --> 05:59.220
Somebody killed a demon.
Hello? We do that every day.

06:00.009 --> 06:02.819
- Merl was harmless.
- Okay.

06:03.009 --> 06:05.990
You' re not bent because
we interrupted something?

06:06.610 --> 06:08.860
- No.
- Okay.

06:09.610 --> 06:12.310
Usually doesn't take you
two hours to answer a page.

06:12.610 --> 06:16.019
Did somebody put you back in charge?
They forgot to tell me.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.139
All right.

06:18.610 --> 06:23.350
Gunn, if this isn't something
you can get behind, we'll understand.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.819
For now, why don't you
just go on home?

06:30.009 --> 06:31.829
Go home.

06:31.810 --> 06:35.430
You know what?
That's probably a real good idea.

06:40.209 --> 06:41.470
Little creep.

06:41.410 --> 06:43.899
- Angel.
- Merl.

06:45.009 --> 06:48.240
He was right. I never bothered
to get to know who he was.

06:48.610 --> 06:50.819
Now I guess I'll have to.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.779
This is a situation
you might wanna rethink.

07:29.209 --> 07:31.000
- Nice rig.
- Glad you like it.

07:31.610 --> 07:34.629
He should. He built it.

07:35.810 --> 07:39.220
Gio, you wanna get that thing
out of my boy's face?

07:40.009 --> 07:42.430
You're still passing along
what I taught you.

07:42.410 --> 07:46.480
Word's out. Vamps know better
than to even cross Venice Boulevard.

07:47.209 --> 07:50.189
Crew's as tight as it's ever been.
Even in your day.

07:51.410 --> 07:53.800
- Charles Gunn?
- That's right.

07:54.410 --> 07:58.410
I know all about you. That name is
part of the reason I came out here.

07:59.209 --> 08:01.459
- Gio's from Miami.
- Coast-to-coast, huh?

08:01.610 --> 08:03.290
Something like that.

08:04.009 --> 08:06.959
You might be able to help me out.
Why is it...

08:07.610 --> 08:10.730
...that places like L.A. and Miami
bring out the teeth?

08:11.209 --> 08:14.439
You'd think vamps would want
to hang in less sunny climes...

08:14.810 --> 08:17.410
- ...know what I'm saying?
- I think I do.

08:17.810 --> 08:21.500
- Maybe we could ask your boss why.
- Yo, Gio.

08:22.610 --> 08:24.819
You can't beat them, right, Chuck?

08:25.009 --> 08:27.540
- It ain't even like that.
- No?

08:28.610 --> 08:31.910
Okay. If you say so.

08:32.210 --> 08:33.820
See, because I heard...

08:34.610 --> 08:39.110
...that you was this
bigtime alpha vamp killer...

08:41.210 --> 08:44.440
...and now you working with one.
What's up with that?

08:44.809 --> 08:49.090
Gio, who's supposed
to be on point out back?

08:50.210 --> 08:53.649
- That'd be me.
- So why ain't you back there?

08:58.610 --> 09:03.210
Yeah, all right, it's cool.
Y'all can have your nice little visit.

09:04.009 --> 09:08.679
But you might want to do that outside,
in the sunshine.

09:09.409 --> 09:12.039
Just to be on the safe side, you know?

09:16.610 --> 09:19.100
Some people just need
a little time alone.

09:19.610 --> 09:23.159
She's had time alone. Five years.
I think that's the problem.

09:23.809 --> 09:26.830
She's been back three months,
and she hasn't gone out.

09:27.409 --> 09:31.200
It's not like the last time she was
out, she got sucked into a portal...

09:32.210 --> 09:36.350
...and ended up living like a hunted
animal in a demon alterna-world.

09:37.009 --> 09:38.549
Wait. Kind of is, isn't it?

09:38.809 --> 09:41.899
Which is why I'm asking you
to, you know, talk to her.

09:42.409 --> 09:44.690
- That's not a great idea.
- You don't like her?

09:45.409 --> 09:48.080
Sure, I like her. What's not to like?

09:48.409 --> 09:49.950
She's sweet and adorable...

09:50.809 --> 09:54.250
...and seems to be laughing
at something that shrub said.

09:54.409 --> 09:57.429
It's not that I don't like her.
I just don't get her.

09:58.009 --> 10:02.149
I'm not asking you to get her.
I'm just asking you to...

10:03.409 --> 10:04.639
...talk to her.

10:08.210 --> 10:09.750
Fine. We'll chat.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.190
Thanks.

10:13.610 --> 10:16.940
- What's this?
- "Enemies of Merl" list.

10:20.210 --> 10:23.929
Hey, why is my name
at the top of this list?

10:24.409 --> 10:25.570
Uh, A?

10:26.210 --> 10:29.330
- Merl and I were not enemies.
- Oh, okay. My mistake.

10:29.809 --> 10:31.740
I found the body, remember?

10:32.210 --> 10:34.240
Oh, and that's not suspicious.

10:34.610 --> 10:37.909
The one time you pay Merl
a social visit, he ends up dead.

10:38.809 --> 10:40.700
I recognize many of these names.

10:41.210 --> 10:44.789
You should. They weren't enemies
until we made him snitch on them.

10:45.409 --> 10:48.460
Oh, sure. I went dark,
and I killed Merl.

10:49.610 --> 10:52.700
We'll work backwards.
End with the A's. How's that?

10:53.210 --> 10:55.840
We should start tracking
these names.

10:56.809 --> 10:59.129
Ask yourself this:

10:59.210 --> 11:03.139
If I had killed Merl,
would I have brought doughnuts?

11:05.809 --> 11:09.070
I guess that's the word on me
now, huh? Traitor, vamp lover?

11:10.009 --> 11:12.220
Don't listen to Gio.
He don't know you.

11:12.409 --> 11:16.340
You do. You think I turned my back
on y'all to hook up with one of them?

11:17.809 --> 11:21.289
I ain't seen your back.
I don't know which way it's facing.

11:21.409 --> 11:24.919
- That's no answer.
- Truth? I ain't heard a word from you.

11:25.610 --> 11:29.889
Not since we spread what was left
of George in the river.

11:31.009 --> 11:34.340
I didn't mean to disappear on y'all.
I didn't plan it.

11:34.610 --> 11:38.440
- I guess after George--
- You were gone way before George.

11:40.009 --> 11:44.190
It was Alonna, man. Things, they
were never the same after Alonna.

11:44.809 --> 11:48.250
I couldn't keep my own sister safe.
What could I do for you?

11:49.009 --> 11:53.360
You done a lot. People are alive
because of something you started.

11:54.409 --> 11:57.220
No, man. Something we started.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.690
Got that right.

12:05.210 --> 12:06.580
What's this one?

12:07.009 --> 12:10.059
Samuel Larch, a bookie.
Merl owed him a lot of money.

12:10.610 --> 12:13.840
- Demon or human?
- I'm not sure.

12:16.009 --> 12:18.080
Care to find out?

12:20.809 --> 12:22.740
Demon, then.

12:29.809 --> 12:33.600
I think when we find whatever's
doing this, we're gonna need Gunn.

12:34.009 --> 12:37.730
I agree. From the look of this,
what we're up against is...

12:38.210 --> 12:40.840
...quite big, extremely powerful--

12:41.809 --> 12:43.909
And really pissed off.

12:59.809 --> 13:02.019
Hello? Who's there, please?

13:02.210 --> 13:04.559
Get him!

13:05.809 --> 13:07.460
Come on!

13:13.610 --> 13:14.659
Smoke him, Gio!

13:40.889 --> 13:42.500
- Gunn.
- Hey.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.389
Got your page. Where's Angel?

13:45.690 --> 13:48.639
He's checking on something else.
Come in.

13:49.889 --> 13:54.809
Victim's name was Samuel Larch.
We found him last night.

13:55.289 --> 13:57.009
- Guy was a demon.
- Yeah.

13:58.889 --> 14:00.330
Wesley?

14:00.690 --> 14:03.950
What are we doing, man?
Who we working for anyway?

14:04.289 --> 14:07.309
Did The Powers send us here?
Did Cordy get a vision?

14:07.889 --> 14:09.429
- No.
- Then what?

14:13.289 --> 14:17.049
Things are not always so simple
as just slaying the big bad ugly.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.100
- There are shades of gray.
- Yeah.

14:19.889 --> 14:24.350
And green and a sickly yellow and
sometimes puce with horns. I get it.

14:25.289 --> 14:29.820
What I don't get is why we are playing
cleanup crew to a bunch of demons.

14:30.090 --> 14:34.269
So we bust our butts till we find
whatever did Merl and this Larch guy.

14:35.490 --> 14:37.629
And six other victims we linked to it.

14:37.889 --> 14:40.210
So we find this demon killing machine.
What then?

14:40.889 --> 14:43.590
We gonna stop it or thank it?

14:43.889 --> 14:45.710
I don't know.

14:46.289 --> 14:48.289
You don't know.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.679
From all I can determine,
this victim was assimilated.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.690
No history of violence,
no threat to anyone.

14:57.690 --> 15:01.409
Two of the others would have
to be classified as irredeemably evil.

15:01.889 --> 15:03.220
What are you saying?

15:03.690 --> 15:07.730
Whatever's responsible for these
attacks isn't making distinctions.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.259
It's just killing, randomly.

15:11.490 --> 15:13.980
- You were right. Happened again.
- When?

15:14.490 --> 15:18.490
Last night. A Yarbnie was
eviscerated in a sewer, Century City.

15:19.889 --> 15:23.259
- Yarbie? What's that?
- Yarbnie. A balancing entity.

15:23.490 --> 15:28.129
They tend to nest in urban areas
under roadways. Utterly nonviolent.

15:28.889 --> 15:33.700
I should hit the streets. See if I can
shake anything loose. If you want.

15:34.889 --> 15:38.049
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
- Cool. I'm on it.

15:38.490 --> 15:40.590
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:48.690 --> 15:53.220
Explain this. It was dug out of the
wall of an apartment on Miracle Mile.

15:54.090 --> 15:55.000
Yeah, so?

15:55.289 --> 15:58.769
I recognize it. It's out of my old rig,
the one your pal Gio's been using.

15:59.490 --> 16:00.500
Okay.

16:00.690 --> 16:04.450
I came to give you a heads up.
You got a rogue on your crew.

16:05.490 --> 16:09.909
Gio's been killing anything that moves.
You got to have a sit-down with him.

16:10.289 --> 16:11.940
This ain't how we do things.

16:12.690 --> 16:14.830
You dug this out of an apartment
on the Mile?

16:15.090 --> 16:16.669
- Yes.
- Tall white towers?

16:16.889 --> 16:19.210
This is funny. Gio ain't no rogue.

16:19.889 --> 16:23.259
He found the place, but we was
all there. The whole crew.

16:24.090 --> 16:27.529
- You?
- Brother, the thing wasn't human.

16:28.289 --> 16:29.830
We took care of it.

16:30.090 --> 16:33.419
- But did it attack anybody?
- No. We got away clean.

16:34.289 --> 16:38.149
- No, I mean before you broke in.
- We didn't give it a chance to.

16:39.690 --> 16:42.220
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

16:42.690 --> 16:45.850
Yo, Rondell. Everyone's here, man.

16:46.889 --> 16:48.539
You guys packing heat now?

16:48.690 --> 16:51.009
You can never be too careful.
I gotta go.

16:51.690 --> 16:55.590
Wanna come with us tonight? Gio
says he found a nest. Primo hunting.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.029
No, man, I got something.

16:59.490 --> 17:00.860
Be good.

17:05.490 --> 17:10.759
Hey. You know something? He still
thinks you're some kind of hero.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.900
But me and you, we know better, right?

17:16.890 --> 17:19.420
Yeah. Yeah, we know better.

17:25.890 --> 17:27.259
Come on, let's go.

17:33.569 --> 17:38.140
I haven't any idea what this might be.
It doesn't fit any of the data.

17:38.970 --> 17:41.990
- Something's missing.
- Maybe it's never been recorded.

17:42.569 --> 17:46.569
Don't tell me another portal's opened.
We have enough monsters in L.A.

17:47.369 --> 17:50.740
No, something's missing.
We're missing an evidence bag.

17:51.569 --> 17:53.670
Seven. Eight. Nine.

17:53.970 --> 17:57.299
Yes, here's 10, here's 12, but...

17:57.569 --> 17:59.890
...where's 11? What was 11?

18:04.769 --> 18:06.240
- Hi.
- Ha!

18:06.569 --> 18:08.599
- You startled me.
- I'm sorry.

18:08.970 --> 18:12.200
- No, it's my fault. I'm sorry, okay?
- Yeah.

18:13.769 --> 18:18.579
- Well, I'll get out of your way.
- No, Fred, I want you to stay. Stay.

18:20.369 --> 18:24.650
Actually, I was hoping
we could, you know, talk.

18:25.170 --> 18:28.470
Well, yeah, of course.

18:37.170 --> 18:39.240
- Did you mean now?
- Yes.

18:39.569 --> 18:42.660
I'm sorry. It's just that
I feel a little awkward.

18:46.170 --> 18:48.799
Angel wants you to get out.

18:50.369 --> 18:52.049
Oh, I see.

18:52.170 --> 18:55.119
No, I understand.
I only have a few things to pack.

18:55.769 --> 18:58.609
- It won't take long.
- That's not what I meant.

18:59.369 --> 19:02.599
Out into the real world. You know,
just for an evening or something.

19:02.970 --> 19:07.849
Oh. Oh. Oh.

19:08.970 --> 19:13.960
Not by yourself or anything.
What if we went out together?

19:15.569 --> 19:20.240
Well, I suppose I would be okay
if I was with you, right?

19:20.970 --> 19:22.130
Sure.

19:22.170 --> 19:25.720
- I mean, that'd be safe, right?
- Of course it would.

19:26.369 --> 19:28.900
No one would look at me
twice with you around.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.670
Exactly!

19:31.170 --> 19:34.579
No. Now, that's just not true.
People will notice you.

19:35.369 --> 19:37.829
- They will?
- Yes. And you know why?

19:38.369 --> 19:42.789
Because you'll be standing on a stage
in the white-hot spotlight.

19:43.769 --> 19:45.490
I will?

20:26.369 --> 20:28.190
- Hey.
Hey.

20:28.170 --> 20:30.700
- You the only one here?
- Yeah.

20:32.369 --> 20:34.369
You making any progress?

20:34.769 --> 20:38.980
I don't know. Maybe. Wesley thinks
the crimes have been random.

20:39.569 --> 20:41.710
- I'm starting to think otherwise.
- Oh?

20:41.970 --> 20:46.609
The way it's happening, it reminds me
of things I've seen before.

20:48.569 --> 20:50.289
How so?

20:50.369 --> 20:53.920
The pattern. The seeming
randomness of it. The chaos.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.660
There's a larger purpose
behind every move.

20:58.170 --> 20:59.680
What?

21:00.569 --> 21:02.039
To have fun.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.359
Something wrong?

21:08.970 --> 21:13.109
No. Just need to see the boss.
Know where he's at?

21:28.769 --> 21:32.809
I swear to God,
she picked out the song herself.

21:58.170 --> 22:00.869
I know what you're doing, and don't.

22:02.369 --> 22:04.829
Stop it. Do not.

22:05.369 --> 22:07.369
Hey! Don't go reading me.

22:08.369 --> 22:12.089
I wouldn't.
But, sweetie, you're a billboard.

22:14.369 --> 22:17.990
He came in with some questions.
Looks like you got the answers.

22:18.569 --> 22:20.670
I really don't feel
like going over there.

22:21.569 --> 22:24.660
So you wanna talk about it?

22:28.170 --> 22:29.430
Do I gotta sing?

22:33.569 --> 22:35.150
Go!

22:53.369 --> 22:54.420
Party!

22:58.890 --> 23:00.569
My club!

23:13.890 --> 23:17.220
I thought demon violence
was impossible in here.

23:17.490 --> 23:19.210
Those aren't demons.

23:25.890 --> 23:28.240
That's time! Let's truck!

23:28.890 --> 23:33.490
Whoa, don't be in such a rush, now.
Don't be in such a hurry.

23:34.289 --> 23:38.049
You're liable to miss out on
the more interesting things in life.

23:39.690 --> 23:42.109
Yo! Charlie Gunn!

23:43.890 --> 23:47.890
Come on, now. I know you in here.
Where you at?

23:50.490 --> 23:52.519
I'm right here.

23:54.690 --> 23:57.710
G-Man, what are you doing here?

24:01.890 --> 24:03.329
Come on, tell him.

24:03.690 --> 24:06.990
Tell him how you been
rolling up in here for months...

24:07.890 --> 24:10.700
...tossing back drinks
with your demon buddies.

24:12.089 --> 24:14.549
What he's saying, that ain't true.

24:15.089 --> 24:19.509
Why not? His best friend's a vampire.
What did you expect?

24:21.690 --> 24:25.829
Rondell, go.
Just take your crew and leave.

24:26.490 --> 24:28.420
No. Not until I get some answers.

24:28.890 --> 24:31.730
That's right. Answers.
The man wants some answers.

24:32.490 --> 24:34.029
Yes, I think we all would.

24:34.289 --> 24:35.970
- Wesley.
- Stay out of this.

24:36.690 --> 24:40.170
As much as I'd like to,
I'm afraid I'm in it. We all are.

24:44.490 --> 24:47.259
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey!

24:47.490 --> 24:50.859
- That's enough!
- Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

24:51.690 --> 24:54.849
- I don't believe this.
- He's okay, man.

24:55.289 --> 24:57.750
- Nice.
- He ain't okay. Look at him!

24:58.289 --> 25:01.410
- You don't know what you're doing.
- It was them.

25:01.890 --> 25:04.519
They killed Merl and the others.

25:12.690 --> 25:14.619
You knew.

25:16.289 --> 25:19.700
I should have said something.
I was going to. I was just....

25:21.089 --> 25:24.039
I was trying to work it out.
Figure how to deal.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.200
- Have you worked it out yet?
- I'm sorry.

25:26.490 --> 25:28.279
You gonna apologize to this thing?

25:28.289 --> 25:29.799
- Move.
- You might wanna.

25:30.690 --> 25:33.500
You can't do that, man.
I can't let you.

25:35.490 --> 25:38.789
- You lost the mission, bro.
- What?

25:40.289 --> 25:42.890
What you been doing,
this ain't right.

25:43.289 --> 25:46.099
- This is not what we're about.
- The hell you say.

25:46.890 --> 25:51.069
I don't know what you're about,
but we been protecting our own.

25:51.690 --> 25:54.809
Is it protecting your own to break
into people's homes?

25:55.289 --> 25:58.619
- They ain't people. Are you?
- Stop!

26:00.690 --> 26:02.480
Stop it.

26:03.690 --> 26:08.039
I'd prefer a clean kill. The last time
I was wounded, it took months to heal.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.789
Wounded, if I recall,
in an attempt to help you.

26:12.089 --> 26:14.650
Look at me. Look at me!

26:15.690 --> 26:19.240
It's got nothing to do with them, man.
This is between us. Us.

26:19.890 --> 26:21.259
Let them go, man.

26:21.690 --> 26:24.599
Yeah, why not? We can do that.

26:25.289 --> 26:28.309
After all, we ain't monsters.

26:31.890 --> 26:35.890
Take my truck. It's outside.
They won't stop you.

26:36.690 --> 26:41.039
How can you be here with these
things and tell me I lost the mission?

26:42.089 --> 26:44.190
Because it's true.

26:44.490 --> 26:46.740
We used to face death
because we had to.

26:46.890 --> 26:49.910
Now you chase it down for fun.
That ain't right.

26:51.089 --> 26:52.809
One!

26:52.890 --> 26:56.299
Just one. Her. She can go.
The others stay.

26:57.089 --> 26:58.029
Come on, man.

26:58.289 --> 27:02.150
I'm not leaving here without her.
No way.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.829
No! No.

27:08.490 --> 27:12.420
The rest will be able to leave
after she brings back the vampire.

27:13.289 --> 27:16.029
Then we'll see who lost the mission.

27:27.089 --> 27:31.869
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

27:32.490 --> 27:35.750
Shut up! He ain't listening.

27:38.450 --> 27:42.559
We have to think of a better plan.
This is a bad plan. It's their plan.

27:43.250 --> 27:46.059
They want you where you can't fight
so they can kill you.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.789
- No choice.
- It'll be suicide.

27:48.049 --> 27:51.279
- It'll be okay.
- It won't. You didn't see these guys.

27:52.250 --> 27:54.039
- Go to this address.
- What is it?

27:54.650 --> 27:56.720
- Transuding Furies.
- Gesundheit,

27:57.049 --> 27:59.119
Lorne hires them to cast
a sanctorium spell on Caritas.

27:59.450 --> 28:01.769
Tell them to lift the spell,
then I can fight back.

28:02.450 --> 28:06.380
They'll lift the spell, then you can
fight all 20 and still get killed.

28:06.650 --> 28:08.190
Cordy, please, just do it.

28:08.450 --> 28:11.359
- What if they won't lift the spell?
- Tell them it's for me.

28:12.049 --> 28:13.349
- You know them?
- I did.

28:13.849 --> 28:15.289
- They'll remember you?
- They should.

28:15.650 --> 28:18.670
They better! Angel.

28:19.250 --> 28:21.180
I told her she'd be safe with me.

28:21.650 --> 28:23.329
I know.

28:44.450 --> 28:47.079
We've gotta do something.
They'll kill Angel.

28:47.450 --> 28:50.569
No, they won't.
They're gonna make me do it.

28:55.849 --> 28:57.430
Hey, Chuck!

28:57.650 --> 29:02.109
Did I ever tell you you're my--
Hey.

29:18.849 --> 29:21.660
I'm starting to think
this vamp ain't gonna show.

29:22.450 --> 29:24.660
Miami.

29:26.049 --> 29:28.609
Did you say something to me,
green boy?

29:29.650 --> 29:33.579
Was 3000 miles really
far enough, I wonder?

29:35.049 --> 29:36.839
I know why you left.

29:40.450 --> 29:42.980
Why you ran.

29:44.650 --> 29:49.460
You couldn't stay there, could you?
After what you did.

29:51.849 --> 29:55.039
- She trusted you.
- Shut up.

29:56.650 --> 29:59.599
Right up until the end,
she trusted you. Did you know that?

30:09.849 --> 30:11.779
Hey, that one's trying to run!

30:17.650 --> 30:20.599
Oh, God. They'll kill us all.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.349
I told you to watch the door!

30:33.250 --> 30:35.529
You see that? You see that?!

30:36.849 --> 30:39.660
He's trying to save that lowlife.

30:44.049 --> 30:46.890
Know what this thing does?
It's a baby killer.

30:47.049 --> 30:49.819
I seen plenty of them in Florida.

30:53.650 --> 30:58.359
- You like to eat babies, don't you?
- Yeah, go ahead. I don't care.

30:59.049 --> 31:03.759
Think I care? Go ahead
and do it, cowards. Cowards.

31:05.650 --> 31:09.720
So who does he go after?
Who does he draw down on?

31:10.450 --> 31:14.140
The baby-killing monster? Nope, me.
What does that tell you?

31:14.650 --> 31:16.789
There's a lot of monsters
to choose from.

31:17.650 --> 31:19.789
And maybe you one of them.

31:20.650 --> 31:23.420
You one of them, Chuck?
They turn you already?

31:23.650 --> 31:25.970
Come at me and find out.

31:26.650 --> 31:28.720
Yeah, I think he's one of them.

31:29.049 --> 31:31.750
Or maybe you just want to be.

31:35.650 --> 31:38.069
Yeah, that's more like it.

31:38.049 --> 31:41.210
I bet they won't even let you
in their little club.

31:42.250 --> 31:46.990
You ain't good enough for the vamps,
demons and baby-eating monsters.

31:47.650 --> 31:49.230
That's what I'm guessing.

31:49.450 --> 31:52.859
Buy them drinks, wine them
and dine them, stick up for them.

31:53.650 --> 31:57.509
"Oh, yeah, that one's okay. "
And they still won't put you on.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.099
- Ain't that a blip?
- Shut up.

32:00.849 --> 32:03.549
What we heard about
his sister might not be right.

32:03.849 --> 32:07.289
He was the only one there to see it.
Know what I'm saying?

32:08.650 --> 32:10.400
I'll taste your children.

32:10.450 --> 32:13.779
You the one let her
get vamped, right, Chuck?

32:14.650 --> 32:17.769
I wouldn't let no bloodsucker
get that close to my sister.

32:18.250 --> 32:20.420
- And why?
- I live in playgrounds.

32:20.650 --> 32:24.579
Were you thinking that finally
she was gonna give it up to you?

32:25.450 --> 32:28.819
Was that the plan?
And that's why you let her get bit.

32:29.650 --> 32:31.720
--bodies. Leave them for a husk.

32:32.049 --> 32:35.839
And then when she was there,
all vamped out and hungry...

32:36.849 --> 32:39.690
...you thought you might
get that eternal kiss.

32:39.849 --> 32:43.259
And when she said, "No,"
that's when you stuck it to her.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.609
- Shut up!
- Not in here. No.

32:47.049 --> 32:51.509
Are you trucking with vamps and
demons to get a piece of that action?

32:52.450 --> 32:55.079
I said shut up!

32:59.049 --> 33:01.470
- This is a sanctuary.
- Not anymore.

33:01.450 --> 33:02.779
Nice shot.

33:05.049 --> 33:06.309
Am I next?

33:11.730 --> 33:13.759
Now's your chance, G.

33:14.130 --> 33:17.289
Prove to everyone here this thing...

33:21.329 --> 33:23.650
...ain't no friend to you.

33:24.930 --> 33:26.930
This is madness. Angel has a soul.

33:27.329 --> 33:28.869
- He's a vampire.
- With a soul!

33:29.730 --> 33:32.400
Whatever. You think that
makes him the same as us?

33:32.730 --> 33:35.680
No, better.
Better than you, anyway.

33:36.329 --> 33:39.279
When he did his pleasure-killing,
he had no soul.

33:39.930 --> 33:42.910
You can make no such claim.

33:43.529 --> 33:45.779
What's it gonna be?

33:54.329 --> 33:58.539
Here, Charles.
Let me make it simple for you.

34:03.930 --> 34:06.740
Take a look. This is what I am.

34:06.930 --> 34:11.179
Deal with it or don't,
but make a damn choice.

34:16.250 --> 34:20.820
So Angel says that
you and he go way back?

34:21.650 --> 34:23.929
Mmm.... Angel.

34:24.650 --> 34:30.380
So about the sanctorium mojo
you've got going on at Caritas....

34:31.250 --> 34:35.780
Any chance you can pull the plug
on that? Kind of an emergency.

34:36.650 --> 34:37.949
- You would have us...
- ...lift what...

34:38.449 --> 34:40.239
- ...has been put in...
- ...place by mutual...

34:40.250 --> 34:42.139
- ...consent...
- ...and contract.

34:43.250 --> 34:44.900
If you don't, Angel will die.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.789
Mmm.... Angel.

34:54.050 --> 34:55.210
It's not gonna happen.

34:55.250 --> 34:57.849
- I knew it.
- You don't know nothing.

34:59.449 --> 35:02.679
You think I won't kill him
because he's my friend?

35:03.650 --> 35:05.650
That ain't why.

35:06.650 --> 35:09.139
Truth is, he could
never be my friend...

35:09.650 --> 35:11.579
...on account of what he is.

35:11.449 --> 35:14.260
Not his fault really.
It's the way it worked out.

35:15.050 --> 35:18.739
He ain't your friend. I am.
You're gonna choose that over me?

35:19.250 --> 35:21.000
Looks like.

35:21.650 --> 35:23.579
It's about the mission, bro.

35:24.050 --> 35:26.960
- He's got it, and you don't.
- Oh.

35:27.650 --> 35:32.500
You think 'cause you letting
that monster live you got the mission?

35:33.650 --> 35:37.789
As far as I can see, a monster lover
ain't no better than a monster.

35:38.449 --> 35:41.639
And I kill monsters.
That's what I do.

35:43.849 --> 35:48.269
So anybody want to walk
out of here tonight...

35:49.250 --> 35:51.039
...they gonna have to show me.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.909
Come on, step on up
and do what your friend wouldn't.

35:55.250 --> 35:58.230
Kill the vampire,
and you can leave this place.

35:58.849 --> 36:00.739
Otherwise...

36:01.250 --> 36:04.480
...stay and burn
with the rest of them.

36:08.449 --> 36:10.980
Who wants to live?

36:21.650 --> 36:23.650
I'm sorry.

36:24.050 --> 36:28.579
I just....
I don't want to die.

36:39.050 --> 36:40.730
Look, this is really urgent.

36:41.449 --> 36:45.239
I know Lorne pays you for this
spell. What will it take to lift it?

36:45.650 --> 36:47.119
- This is not a debt...
- ...you can pay.

36:47.449 --> 36:48.849
You don't know that.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.320
My credit has been good this year.

36:52.250 --> 36:53.409
- Only Angel...
- ...is equipped...

36:53.449 --> 36:54.460
...to pay this debt.

36:54.650 --> 36:55.880
Angel?

36:56.449 --> 37:01.789
For a guy a couple of centuries old,
not very big with the wise investing.

37:03.050 --> 37:06.489
And when you say "equipped,"
that isn't what you mean, is it?

37:07.250 --> 37:11.429
- Mmm.... Angel.
- Got it. And, ew.

37:15.449 --> 37:17.550
I'm sorry.

37:19.050 --> 37:21.750
I just can't die in here.

37:23.250 --> 37:25.670
It's okay. I understand.

37:28.050 --> 37:32.300
All right, now you want to get it
in the heart, or it's no good.

37:37.650 --> 37:40.739
I thought I might shoot you
in the throat instead.

37:41.250 --> 37:44.440
If I pierce a carotid artery,
considering the temperature...

37:44.849 --> 37:48.469
...because someone shot the thermostat,
the blood loss will be heavy.

37:49.050 --> 37:52.460
There's a chance I'll puncture
a vocal chord and you won't scream.

37:53.250 --> 37:57.500
You'll want to when the blood loss
results in a cerebrovascular event.

37:58.650 --> 38:02.199
That's a stroke.
I wasn't trying to sound snooty.

38:04.050 --> 38:05.659
Fred.

38:06.449 --> 38:10.769
Fred, it's okay.
Just point it at me. At me, Fred.

38:11.849 --> 38:13.570
No, I can't.

38:13.650 --> 38:17.300
Yes, you can. It's okay. Really.

38:23.849 --> 38:25.880
Thank you, ladies. I owe you one.

38:27.449 --> 38:29.590
Come on, you guys! Take these fools!

38:29.849 --> 38:32.969
Fight! It's ten against three!
This is pathetic.

38:34.050 --> 38:36.929
I'm done with you!
Why did I come to this coast?!

38:37.050 --> 38:39.750
L.A. sucks!
I'm going back to Florida.

38:40.650 --> 38:45.289
If you're lucky, I'll drag you on
the beach for sunshine, and totally--

39:11.130 --> 39:14.570
Don't guess Rondell will cross
Venice Boulevard again soon.

39:15.329 --> 39:17.400
It's never easy.

39:17.730 --> 39:20.820
The pull of divided loyalties.

39:21.329 --> 39:25.610
Whatever choice we make, we feel
as though we've betrayed someone.

39:26.730 --> 39:28.170
Yeah.

39:30.329 --> 39:34.750
If you withhold information or attempt
to subvert me again, I will fire you.

39:35.130 --> 39:39.769
I can't have any member of this team
compromising the safety of the group.

39:40.530 --> 39:44.500
If you do it again, you will be
dismissed, bag and baggage.

40:01.530 --> 40:04.059
You're gonna get on me
about what I said.

40:04.530 --> 40:05.929
No.

40:06.329 --> 40:09.099
You understand, I had to stall.
Keep it going.

40:09.329 --> 40:10.449
I get that.

40:11.130 --> 40:15.659
- Doesn't mean I meant it.
- You meant it, but that's okay.

40:16.530 --> 40:19.650
Can't help the way I feel, man.
Just the way it is.

40:20.130 --> 40:24.030
Doesn't mean I don't want to work
with you or I don't like you.

40:24.929 --> 40:26.820
Maybe someday. I don't know.

40:27.329 --> 40:30.630
I don't know either.
But I got time.

40:35.730 --> 40:37.239
Hey.

40:39.929 --> 40:44.809
No matter what else, I proved you
could trust me when I didn't kill you.

40:45.929 --> 40:50.139
You'll prove I can trust you when the
day comes that you have to kill me...

40:50.730 --> 40:52.380
...and you do.
