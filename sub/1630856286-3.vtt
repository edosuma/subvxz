No better time of year.

00:22.250 --> 00:27.500
You know, let me tell you
one of my favorite Yuletide stories.

00:28.583 --> 00:30.750
'Twas the night before Christmas,

00:30.833 --> 00:32.875
and all through the town,

00:32.958 --> 00:37.583
the Avengers were fighting
a brand-new superpower.

00:37.666 --> 00:39.833
The stockings were hung by the chimney...

wondering who this guy is.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.875
Perhaps I should start a bit further back.

01:03.250 --> 01:04.291
THE WATCHER: Time.

01:07.708 --> 01:08.708
Space.

01:10.375 --> 01:11.458
Reality.

01:14.333 --> 01:16.125
It's more than a linear path.

01:20.916 --> 01:25.500
It's a prism of endless possibility,

01:27.916 --> 01:31.541
where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,

01:34.166 --> 01:37.125
creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.

01:41.041 --> 01:42.375
I am the Watcher.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.625
I am your guide
through these vast new realities.

01:49.250 --> 01:52.916
Follow me and ponder the question...

01:56.458 --> 01:57.666
"What if?"

02:21.041 --> 02:22.250
We have a code red down here.

02:22.333 --> 02:25.375
Darcy, I told you,
while JARVIS is being defragged,

02:25.458 --> 02:27.166
this line is for emergency use only.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.375
Please. Sparrow-1 on the comms, boss.

Where are the Kogi buns?

for this? Listen to me.

This Avengers holiday gala
is not my first rodeo.

Fine, fine. Ten to the four, Puffin-2.

02:44.708 --> 02:47.250
Wait. Why am I a puffin?
And a second puffin at that.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.333
-Who's the first puffin?
-Bernard in Accounting.

02:50.125 --> 02:51.458
Okay, that just hurts.

02:51.541 --> 02:55.583
I can offer you Turkey-1, Flamingo-6.
Ooh, how about the Parakeet?

shut down for maintenance...

Oh, I wanna talk to you about that.
I'd like to share a few messages

03:24.791 --> 03:26.291
about upgrading our threat matrix...

03:26.375 --> 03:28.708
Maybe you should leave that
to the security professionals.

13:11.541 --> 13:12.791
What are you calling me for?

13:12.875 --> 13:15.500
Tell JARVIS to dial up
the army or the Avengers.

13:15.583 --> 13:17.291
(GASPS) Or that scary dude

13:17.375 --> 13:20.458
JARVIS is offline defragging.
It's how they were able to...

13:20.541 --> 13:22.083
Darcy, you're a genius.

13:22.166 --> 13:25.750
Thanks. I have been in college

13:25.833 --> 13:27.375
Not to brag. But what did I say?

13:27.458 --> 13:29.500
JARVIS has a mainframe
in the sub-basement.

13:29.583 --> 13:32.708
If we bring JARVIS back online,
we can take control of the building

13:32.791 --> 13:33.875
and everything inside it.

15:36.291 --> 15:38.458
You thought the doorknob
was the mainframe?

15:38.541 --> 15:41.500
Anyone would.
This is like Narnia for dorks.

15:41.583 --> 15:44.458
There should be a backup JARVIS AI
in the sub-basement.

15:44.541 --> 15:47.666
Boss, he has someone else on the inside.
In the sub-basement.

15:47.750 --> 15:50.416
Wait. I got a better idea.
Get back to the penthouse.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.708
It's better to make them
come to the Hammer.

-(GROWLING)
-Bruce, a little help.

22:38.291 --> 22:40.000
No, you guys got this.

22:40.083 --> 22:41.291
(GRUNTS)

22:43.375 --> 22:44.750
(GRUNTS)

22:44.875 --> 22:46.791
-IRON MAN: Where's Thor?
-(ROARING)

22:46.875 --> 22:48.083
Is that Happy?

22:48.166 --> 22:49.208
Um, no.

22:49.958 --> 22:51.875
ROMANOFF: What is this thing? (GRUNTS)

22:53.291 --> 22:55.166
-(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
-(ROARS)

22:55.250 --> 22:57.416
No, no, no. He's on the guest list.

22:57.500 --> 23:00.041
Repeat, he is on the guest list.

23:00.125 --> 23:01.250
(ELECTRONIC BUZZING)

23:01.333 --> 23:04.125
(GROANS) Natasha! It's me.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.458
Oh, my God. Happy?

23:06.541 --> 23:07.625
(CHUCKLES) I was right.

23:07.708 --> 23:12.000
This is the good guy, that is the bad guy.

23:12.875 --> 23:13.958
(HAMMER CHUCKLES)

23:14.041 --> 23:15.791
IRON MAN: What are you doing with my suit?

23:15.875 --> 23:17.291
HAMMER: Uh, nothing?

23:18.083 --> 23:19.083
(BEEPS)

23:19.166 --> 23:20.916
(METAL CLANGING)

23:21.833 --> 23:22.833
Um...

23:22.916 --> 23:24.375
(ROARS)

23:24.458 --> 23:26.458
(SCREAMING)

23:34.166 --> 23:35.916
(SCREAMING)

23:40.041 --> 23:42.166
You saved me. Why?

23:42.250 --> 23:44.875
It's Christmas, Hammer.
Goodwill towards men.

23:44.958 --> 23:46.625
(PANTS) Even the bad ones.

23:46.708 --> 23:47.708
Huh. (SCREAMS)

23:48.750 --> 23:49.833
(GRUNTS)

23:52.333 --> 23:55.416
I'm sorry about the party, Tony.
I'm sure insurance will cover most of it.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.500
Are you kidding? You're the only
insurance policy I'll ever need.

23:58.583 --> 24:01.041
Ah, thanks, Tony. Wait.
You do have a cure, don't you?

24:01.125 --> 24:02.375
I'm not stuck this way, right?

24:02.458 --> 24:04.083
(LAUGHS)

24:04.166 --> 24:07.166
My head of security, everybody.
How about this guy, right?

24:07.250 --> 24:08.666
-Yeah, Happy.
-Good job, Happy.

24:08.750 --> 24:10.416
-Crushed it, man.
-Bah, humbug.

24:10.500 --> 24:13.583
THE WATCHER: As for how the rest of
this holiday tale goes,

24:13.666 --> 24:18.583
the tower was safe and secure,
still decked in holly and bows,

24:18.666 --> 24:21.666
when Tony Stark to his team
gave a whistle.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.958
IRON MAN: I think
I speak for everyone when I say

24:24.041 --> 24:25.291
some food would be beneficial.

24:25.375 --> 24:29.333
HOGAN: My appetite is raging. I can eat
an actual fruitcake after that fight.

24:29.416 --> 24:33.208
THE WATCHER: But I heard a voice say
as the heroes vanished from sight...

24:33.291 --> 24:36.000
"Merry Christmas to all and to all a..."

24:36.833 --> 24:37.833
Guys?

24:38.291 --> 24:39.666
Oh, I missed the party.

24:39.750 --> 24:41.375
(LAUGHS)

24:41.458 --> 24:44.166
"To all, a good night."

24:45.333 --> 24:48.541
We wish you a merry Christmas

24:48.625 --> 24:51.583
We wish you a merry Christmas

24:51.666 --> 24:58.000
We wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy new year

24:58.083 --> 25:01.000
We wish you a merry Christmas

25:01.083 --> 25:04.333
We wish you a merry Christmas

25:04.416 --> 25:10.875
We wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy new year

25:10.958 --> 25:17.083
Glad tidings we bring to you and your kin

25:17.166 --> 25:23.208
Glad tidings at Christmas
and a happy new year

25:23.291 --> 25:25.416
We wish you a swinging Christmas

25:27.583 --> 25:29.791
We wish you a crazy Christmas

25:29.875 --> 25:35.666
We wish you a naughty Christmas
and a frantic new year

26:01.375 --> 26:02.458
Yeah

26:28.625 --> 26:29.916
DARCY: All right.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.625
(SINGING)
Good Queen Darcy last looked down

26:32.708 --> 26:35.125
On the feast of Steve Rogers

26:35.208 --> 26:37.666
When the snow lay on the ground

26:37.750 --> 26:40.208
Something, something, something

26:40.291 --> 26:45.041
Thor has a giant neck
It is full of muscles

26:45.125 --> 26:51.291
He's just a little schmoopy noodle
Going through the cosmos

26:52.000 --> 26:53.833
(LAUGHS)

26:53.916 --> 26:57.791
Happy Holidays!
Make up dumb songs for money.
