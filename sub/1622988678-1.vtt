02:32.714 --> 02:34.351
ROB:
Come on.

02:40.788 --> 02:41.886
There you go.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.950
Come on.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.590
Have a truffle, girl.

04:18.985 --> 04:20.589
Good find, girl.

06:30.556 --> 06:33.986
AMIR:
Oh, boy.

06:35.055 --> 06:37.154
Excuse me.

06:37.189 --> 06:40.861
No. No, fuck off.

06:40.896 --> 06:41.928
Get away from my car.

06:41.963 --> 06:45.162
Go, go. Come on.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.131
No, no, not me, either.

06:49.476 --> 06:50.706
What's up, old man?

06:54.811 --> 06:56.415
Oh, wow.

06:59.849 --> 07:01.145
Beautiful.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.723
Woo.

07:07.758 --> 07:10.022
I don't know how this
little fucker does it.

07:10.057 --> 07:11.463
How do you do it?

07:15.766 --> 07:16.798
You sure you don't want
one of those,

07:16.833 --> 07:18.899
um, camp showers,

07:18.934 --> 07:20.197
you know,
the ones with the propane

07:20.232 --> 07:23.200
and the hot water?

07:23.235 --> 07:25.741
What about that phone?

07:25.776 --> 07:27.006
I don't wanna be
the one to drive up

07:27.041 --> 07:30.746
and find you, like dead.

07:30.781 --> 07:32.946
You know, there's, like,
animals and shit out here.

07:37.821 --> 07:39.854
Okay.

07:42.155 --> 07:43.561
Oh.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.226
Good talk, Rob.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.964
See you next Thursday, asshole.

08:40.048 --> 08:44.083
WOMAN:
Go out.

08:44.118 --> 08:47.757
Go out, go away.

08:47.792 --> 08:50.155
Get out, get out, it's just--
I'm trying to surprise you.

08:50.190 --> 08:52.058
I'm trying--I'm...

09:16.821 --> 09:18.018
I'm okay.

09:32.199 --> 09:35.002
ROB: It's just coyotes.
Back to bed, girl.

10:25.021 --> 10:26.757
ROB: Hey, hey.

10:32.061 --> 10:33.357
It's just coyotes.

10:37.033 --> 10:39.737
That's it, go to bed.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.176
-

10:50.211 --> 10:54.950
TWEAKER: Go inside! Go!
Get it. Get it!

10:54.985 --> 10:56.380
I got it, I got it, I got it.

11:03.389 --> 11:06.192
- TWEAKER: Oh, my God!

11:09.461 --> 11:10.933
Hey!

11:15.368 --> 11:18.875
No. No. No.

15:23.187 --> 15:24.351
Can I help you?

15:32.262 --> 15:34.031
Marge here?

15:36.299 --> 15:37.694
Marge died 10 years ago.

15:40.303 --> 15:41.500
Oh.

15:44.142 --> 15:46.736
Do you have a phone?

15:46.771 --> 15:49.277
Are you gonna order something?

15:49.312 --> 15:51.444
No.

16:00.290 --> 16:03.093
AMIR: Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.622
Thank you.

16:04.657 --> 16:06.393
You fucker.

16:18.506 --> 16:21.606
Whoa, that hurt?

16:26.613 --> 16:28.184
Listen, man.

16:28.219 --> 16:31.187
You know this isn't, like,
my problem, right?

16:33.719 --> 16:37.358
You want your supply,
I need my pig.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.199
RADIO DJ:
The classical composers

16:43.234 --> 16:45.531
are those of the first rank

16:45.566 --> 16:46.796
who have developed music

16:46.831 --> 16:48.699
to the highest
picture-perfection

16:48.734 --> 16:50.668
on its formal side.

16:50.703 --> 16:52.802
Therefore,
where classical music

16:52.837 --> 16:55.508
proves superior
to all other forms

16:55.543 --> 16:57.807
is in its staying power.

16:57.842 --> 17:00.480
It was beautiful 200 years ago

17:00.515 --> 17:04.286
and will remain beautiful
200 years from now.

17:09.095 --> 17:13.163
Something so potent
and elemental in the appeal...

17:21.371 --> 17:22.535
MAN:
How's it going, Mac?

17:22.570 --> 17:24.504
- MAC: Yo.
- MAN: Mac?

17:34.384 --> 17:35.680
You know, I don't like

17:35.715 --> 17:37.583
buyers coming out to the site.

17:37.618 --> 17:39.651
Yeah, hey, Mac. Sorry.

17:39.686 --> 17:41.818
I'm just, um...

17:41.853 --> 17:43.523
um, uh, we're just looking

17:43.558 --> 17:45.624
for that couple
with the green pickup.

17:45.659 --> 17:48.132
Turquoise.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.827
You got a little somethin'.

17:50.862 --> 17:53.566
Uh, they haven't been around
for a few weeks.

17:53.601 --> 17:54.798
What'd they do?

17:54.833 --> 17:57.438
Nothing.
Just a little misunderstanding

17:57.473 --> 17:58.538
we gotta get sorted out.

17:58.573 --> 18:01.112
They took my pig.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.410
What kind of pig?

18:04.282 --> 18:05.479
It's a truffle pig.

18:05.514 --> 18:07.250
MAC: Motherfucker!

18:07.285 --> 18:08.713
Wicky, you take over.

18:08.748 --> 18:11.254
Anyone fucks with Wicky,
I'll break your fingers.

18:11.289 --> 18:12.321
Motherfuckers!

18:27.602 --> 18:29.305
I expect certain things

18:29.340 --> 18:31.472
from the people
I do business with.

18:31.507 --> 18:33.144
I think that's reasonable.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.146
Yeah. We appreciate that, Mac.

18:35.181 --> 18:36.774
- We really do appreciate it.
- Uh-hmm.

18:36.809 --> 18:38.677
You've been digging my sites.

18:38.712 --> 18:40.481
No. No, no, no.
We wouldn't do that.

18:40.516 --> 18:43.286
This guy comes telling me
you took his pig.

18:43.321 --> 18:44.518
That means you're poaching.

18:44.553 --> 18:45.849
TWEAKETTE: Okay. Listen.

18:45.884 --> 18:47.455
We don't even have
the pig anymore, okay?

18:47.490 --> 18:49.259
- I mean, I swear...
- Who has it?

18:51.626 --> 18:52.790
I don't know.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.399
Did you see him?

18:59.733 --> 19:02.239
I didn't get like
a fucking ID or...

19:03.935 --> 19:05.374
it was just some guy
with money and...

19:05.409 --> 19:07.607
- Rich?
- Um, he came to us.

19:07.642 --> 19:09.213
Oh, he drove a nice car.

19:09.248 --> 19:10.610
What kind of car
did he drive in?

19:10.645 --> 19:12.348
Black.

19:12.383 --> 19:15.285
It was--it was waxy.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.882
It was just some city guy.
I don't--I don't know.

19:26.793 --> 19:29.794
AMIR: So I guess that's it?
Just find a new one?

19:29.829 --> 19:31.730
Another pig can't do
what she did.

19:31.765 --> 19:33.237
I don't know, man. Get a--

19:33.272 --> 19:34.931
get a good trainer
or something.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.801
You lose a season
while I train a pig

19:36.836 --> 19:38.440
that'll never be as good?

19:49.618 --> 19:50.815
Take me to the city.

19:50.850 --> 19:52.850
What?

19:52.885 --> 19:54.522
A city guy.

19:56.295 --> 19:57.657
What are you gonna do,
knock on every

19:57.692 --> 19:58.955
fuckin' door in Portland?

19:58.990 --> 20:01.430
I might know someone

20:01.465 --> 20:02.728
who knows the industry.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.797
You might...

20:05.832 --> 20:09.240
I--I'm not taking you
to the fucking city, okay?

20:09.275 --> 20:10.637
That's where I do my business.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.476
Are you afraid?

20:19.648 --> 20:22.011
Listen, what I do
is all about my reputation.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.848
- People talk.
- People talk?

20:23.883 --> 20:25.718
- Yeah.
- People talk.

20:25.753 --> 20:26.785
Stop saying that.

20:26.820 --> 20:29.392
You like this car?

20:29.427 --> 20:31.889
You like that shirt?

20:35.796 --> 20:36.960
Shut up.

21:38.023 --> 21:40.496
Yo.

21:40.531 --> 21:41.629
Is this the spot?

21:44.898 --> 21:46.403
I need $10.

21:48.572 --> 21:50.374
Sure you do.

22:09.824 --> 22:12.792
the love you lost

23:02.811 --> 23:04.811
Have you heard anything
about a pig?

23:11.721 --> 23:14.458
EDGAR: I remember a time
when your name

23:14.493 --> 23:15.921
meant something
to people, Robin.

23:17.793 --> 23:20.156
But now...

23:20.191 --> 23:21.663
you have no value.

23:27.066 --> 23:29.407
You don't even exist anymore.

23:36.207 --> 23:37.613
You don't exist.

24:00.836 --> 24:02.539
You even know his real name?

24:12.177 --> 24:14.749
Open the door.

24:14.784 --> 24:15.816
How do you know that guy?

24:18.150 --> 24:20.216
Rob, how do you know him?

24:20.251 --> 24:21.789
I used to live around here.

24:24.057 --> 24:25.496
Was that Edgar?

24:27.093 --> 24:28.598
How do you know Edgar?

24:28.633 --> 24:29.962
What time is it?

24:29.997 --> 24:31.931
- What?
- I don't have a watch.

24:31.966 --> 24:34.230
Oh, shocker.

24:34.265 --> 24:35.506
It's 9:15.

24:37.906 --> 24:39.235
What are we doing?

24:39.270 --> 24:40.841
We're waiting until 12:00.

24:55.055 --> 24:56.285
AMIR:
Oh, shit!

24:56.320 --> 24:57.924
Just you--yeah, you go.

25:04.097 --> 25:05.162
Go away.

25:05.197 --> 25:07.835
I need to go inside.

25:07.870 --> 25:09.639
We don't have a bathroom.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.102
- I'm having a night out...
- AMIR: Don't tell him my name,

25:11.137 --> 25:13.038
- ...with my friend.
- AMIR: you stupid asshole.

25:13.073 --> 25:14.545
- What is it?
- Amir?

25:14.580 --> 25:18.780
- AMIR: fucking kill me...
- Amir! Yo!

25:20.850 --> 25:24.819
Dave? What's up, my dude?

25:24.854 --> 25:26.986
I didn't know
you were working tonight.

25:27.021 --> 25:30.088
Yeah. Is this guy with you?

25:30.123 --> 25:33.663
Hey, listen,
he's my dad's friend.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.324
I'm just showing him around
and we're just...

25:35.359 --> 25:37.029
- Just whatever, man.
- He's Buddhist.

25:37.064 --> 25:39.669
I don't care.

25:46.810 --> 25:48.777
AMIR: Do you even know
where we're going?

25:48.812 --> 25:50.009
Rob!

25:50.044 --> 25:51.714
ROB: We're going
to the Hotel Portland.

25:51.749 --> 25:53.309
What?

25:53.344 --> 25:55.685
What hotel? What...

25:55.720 --> 25:56.818
The Hotel Portland.

25:56.853 --> 25:58.182
I know this city.

25:58.217 --> 26:01.020
There is no such thing
as a Hotel Portland.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.122
I'm sticking my neck out.

26:04.157 --> 26:06.322
And we're in my city now,
so you have to--

26:06.357 --> 26:08.060
you know,
you gotta keep me in the loop.

26:08.095 --> 26:10.260
There is no loop.
We're finding my pig.

26:10.295 --> 26:13.703
You're not part of a loop.
You're my ride.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.331
Fuck you, man!

26:15.366 --> 26:17.168
You're just a fucking
homeless asshole

26:17.203 --> 26:18.873
who probably fucks his pig.

26:18.908 --> 26:21.106
I'm so sick of your shit!

26:21.141 --> 26:23.141
Do you know what you're worth
to me without that pig?

26:23.176 --> 26:25.242
Nothing. Fucking zero!

26:25.277 --> 26:27.277
You're gonna have
a fucking stroke in that cabin,

26:27.312 --> 26:30.082
and I'm gonna be the only one
that fucking notices.

26:30.117 --> 26:33.921
So how about try and give me
some fucking respect?

26:33.956 --> 26:36.792
I don't fuck my pig.

26:39.423 --> 26:42.193
Fuck this, man!
I am fucking outta here.

26:46.100 --> 26:50.333
The hotel was torn down
back in the '50s.

26:52.942 --> 26:54.612
Now it's Pioneer Square.

26:56.110 --> 26:59.617
But they just covered up
the subbasement, so...

27:00.950 --> 27:04.083
it's all still there
under the park.

27:04.118 --> 27:07.350
- What?
- ROB: Now it's Edgar's place.

27:07.385 --> 27:10.089
That's where we're going.

27:10.124 --> 27:12.058
Now you're in the loop.

27:13.325 --> 27:14.665
Help me.

27:30.045 --> 27:33.409
ROB: Whatever happens,
just stay back.

27:33.444 --> 27:35.279
AMIR: What does that mean?

27:35.314 --> 27:37.281
What's "whatever?"

27:37.316 --> 27:39.151
Rob?

27:39.186 --> 27:41.417
It's dusty.

27:41.452 --> 27:44.288
Leave that off.
Your eyes will adjust.

27:48.426 --> 27:51.064
Edgar's been running fights
for restaurant workers

27:51.099 --> 27:52.736
for 30 years.

27:52.771 --> 27:56.465
If your name means something,
they'll bid high.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.302
That's all he sees.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.207
AMIR:
How do you know that?

28:08.281 --> 28:10.314
Who are you?

28:25.936 --> 28:29.003
-

28:36.309 --> 28:40.146
Ten seconds.
That is 500 bucks for Dennis.

28:41.886 --> 28:44.414
And next up, we've got...

30:27.057 --> 30:28.485
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

32:57.174 --> 32:58.635
I'm looking...

33:00.045 --> 33:02.177
for my pig.

34:52.454 --> 34:54.685
Sorry.
I don't cook very much.

34:59.395 --> 35:01.296
You know the place?

35:04.400 --> 35:05.762
Finway's?

35:05.797 --> 35:08.666
Yeah, it's hot.

35:08.701 --> 35:11.141
Can you get a reservation
for lunch?

35:12.606 --> 35:14.474
Sure. Yeah.

35:29.755 --> 35:31.458
You know, when I was a kid,

35:34.892 --> 35:36.727
my parents used to do this...

35:38.335 --> 35:40.434
date night thing.

35:40.469 --> 35:42.535
I mean, not a lot,

35:42.570 --> 35:44.900
my dad was really busy.

35:46.409 --> 35:48.574
They'd usually come back

35:48.609 --> 35:50.444
fighting and screaming
at each other.

35:50.479 --> 35:52.380
And my mom would get all...

35:53.482 --> 35:55.812
mopey.

35:55.847 --> 35:58.419
But...

35:58.454 --> 36:00.289
this one night...

36:02.227 --> 36:04.359
I remember...

36:04.394 --> 36:06.328
going to this restaurant and...

36:07.826 --> 36:09.859
they came back,

36:09.894 --> 36:12.598
and they were so happy.

36:12.633 --> 36:14.831
Like, they were smiling

36:14.866 --> 36:18.472
and talking about the food
and the wine

36:18.507 --> 36:21.904
and really, really,
really drunk.

36:23.545 --> 36:27.745
They talked about that meal
for years.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.813
Even after the chef,

36:29.848 --> 36:31.881
this huge chef,

36:31.916 --> 36:34.851
just disappeared.

36:37.559 --> 36:39.295
That was your spot.

36:41.563 --> 36:44.894
People still talk about it,
you know?

36:44.929 --> 36:48.469
It's probably the only time
I remember my mom, like...

36:54.774 --> 36:56.576
What happened to her?

37:00.043 --> 37:01.581
She's...

37:04.355 --> 37:05.750
Um, she killed herself.

37:08.854 --> 37:10.854
She was--

37:10.889 --> 37:12.790
she was never like...

37:14.992 --> 37:17.564
when you're like that,

37:17.599 --> 37:19.995
it's just it's gonna happen
sooner or later.

37:21.966 --> 37:24.340
My dad was--

37:24.375 --> 37:27.640
he was always the tough one

37:27.675 --> 37:29.576
in the family.

37:29.611 --> 37:31.974
So, his business is bomb.

37:35.749 --> 37:39.289
I mean, he's not going anywhere
anytime soon.

37:39.324 --> 37:40.653
He's very--

37:42.492 --> 37:45.559
he's very with it,

37:45.594 --> 37:47.693
know what I mean?

37:47.728 --> 37:49.497
He's locked in.

37:52.931 --> 37:54.568
Motherfucker.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.310
We don't...

38:03.447 --> 38:05.282
have to care.

38:07.814 --> 38:11.420
People first came out here

38:12.852 --> 38:15.688
10,000 years ago...

38:19.958 --> 38:24.466
we would've been
under 400 feet of water.

38:26.701 --> 38:29.603
Every 200 years,

38:29.638 --> 38:31.506
we get an earthquake,

38:31.541 --> 38:33.002
right along the coast.

38:34.775 --> 38:36.412
One's coming up.

38:41.419 --> 38:44.585
When the shockwave hits,

38:44.620 --> 38:47.885
most of the city will flatten.

38:49.988 --> 38:53.792
Every bridge will fall

38:55.026 --> 38:57.092
into the Willamette,

38:57.127 --> 38:58.599
so...

39:00.867 --> 39:03.670
there's nowhere to go

39:03.705 --> 39:04.836
even if we could.

39:10.943 --> 39:15.814
Anyone who survives
that's just waiting.

39:18.687 --> 39:20.852
Five minutes later,

39:23.021 --> 39:24.955
they'll look up

39:27.861 --> 39:31.060
and they'll see a wave

39:31.095 --> 39:33.029
ten stories high.

39:38.542 --> 39:42.577
And then all this, everyone...

39:45.681 --> 39:49.815
it's all gonna be at the bottom
of the ocean.

39:51.819 --> 39:53.148
Again.

40:01.796 --> 40:04.665
You should use stale bread
for French toast.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.738
BRITISH VOICE: A tone becomes
musical material

40:11.773 --> 40:14.972
only by association
with another tone.

40:15.007 --> 40:17.007
We might hear it alone,

40:17.042 --> 40:18.778
study its quality,

40:18.813 --> 40:20.208
and determine its degree

40:20.243 --> 40:22.650
of acuteness or gravity,
but its...

40:24.654 --> 40:27.083
You want that hundred fifty
percent carthusianum?

40:29.087 --> 40:31.186
You come to me.

40:31.221 --> 40:32.957
If you want
some bullshit indicum,

40:32.992 --> 40:34.563
then you go to Katie.

40:34.598 --> 40:36.928
You want some shit
that's been sitting in a--

40:36.963 --> 40:38.831
you want some shit
that's been sitting in a cooler

40:38.866 --> 40:40.635
for three days?
Then you go to my father.

40:40.670 --> 40:42.472
But if you want the real thing,

40:42.507 --> 40:44.936
if you want the real thing
then you come to me.

40:44.971 --> 40:47.136
I'm the king of the jungle.

40:48.711 --> 40:50.238
Hey, you're buddies
with the sous-chef

40:50.273 --> 40:52.878
- over at Finway's, right?
- How many grams are we at?

40:52.913 --> 40:54.242
Uh, 220.

40:54.277 --> 40:56.145
- That's close enough.
- Cool. So, um...

40:56.180 --> 40:57.817
Hey, Jess will get you
on the way out, all right?

40:57.852 --> 40:59.555
Right. Awesome. Um...

40:59.590 --> 41:02.052
you are friends
with Finway's guy, right?

41:02.087 --> 41:04.153
- Yeah.
- Sweet. Sweet.

41:04.188 --> 41:06.122
Yo, you think you could, like,

41:06.157 --> 41:08.531
score me a res
for lunch today or...

41:08.566 --> 41:10.533
You know that's your dad's spot.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.095
Yeah. No, I--I mean, I know.

41:12.130 --> 41:14.097
It's just like--it's fine.

41:14.132 --> 41:15.670
He knows. It's cool.
I'm not there for business.

41:15.705 --> 41:17.232
I'm just--
I have a friend in town.

41:17.267 --> 41:19.509
Anyway, you know how busy
they are this time of year?

41:19.544 --> 41:21.137
For sure.
For sure. But...

41:21.172 --> 41:23.843
I mean, you got
like mad ins there, so.

41:26.111 --> 41:28.177
Come on.

41:28.212 --> 41:29.651
Hey.

41:29.686 --> 41:31.246
Half off.

41:31.281 --> 41:33.116
No.

41:33.151 --> 41:34.854
My friend is Robin Feld.

43:12.987 --> 43:14.723
That sounds nice.

43:14.758 --> 43:16.285
What is it?

43:18.025 --> 43:20.058
It's called a handpan.

43:21.831 --> 43:23.600
Wanna try it?

43:51.223 --> 43:54.191
Does your face hurt?

43:54.226 --> 43:55.962
Yeah.

43:59.198 --> 44:01.165
Thanks.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.035
What's your name?

44:06.238 --> 44:08.007
I'm Rob.

44:10.143 --> 44:12.242
I used to live here.

44:16.853 --> 44:19.788
What happened
to the persimmon tree?

44:19.823 --> 44:21.922
What's a persimmon?

44:23.486 --> 44:25.222
It's a, uh...

44:26.896 --> 44:29.963
it's an orange fruit.

44:29.998 --> 44:31.932
Looks kind of like a tomato.

44:35.938 --> 44:40.303
You--you can't eat it
if it's not ripe.

44:40.338 --> 44:42.745
It's awful.

44:42.780 --> 44:45.110
But...

44:45.145 --> 44:46.441
if you give it time,

44:46.476 --> 44:50.412
it gets rid of these things
called tannins,

44:52.020 --> 44:53.690
and then they're very good.

44:56.288 --> 44:59.388
I don't think
we have a persimmon tree.

45:00.798 --> 45:02.028
No?

45:04.362 --> 45:05.966
That's okay.

45:09.070 --> 45:10.806
Did it die?

45:25.284 --> 45:28.120
EURYDICE WAITRESS: We all have
a set of held beliefs

45:28.155 --> 45:30.254
about the world around us.

45:30.289 --> 45:31.959
To challenge them

45:31.994 --> 45:35.325
is to acknowledge
our foundation is sand,

45:35.360 --> 45:38.328
but it opens us up
to something greater.

45:38.363 --> 45:40.198
To pure connection.

45:40.233 --> 45:42.332
To true life.

45:42.367 --> 45:45.775
Today's journey begins
by uniting the depths of the sea

45:45.810 --> 45:47.337
with the riches of our forests.

45:47.372 --> 45:50.241
We've emulsified
locally sourced scallops

45:50.276 --> 45:53.343
encased in a flash-frozen
seawater roe blend,

45:53.378 --> 45:56.280
on a bed of foraged
huckleberry foam,

45:56.315 --> 45:57.919
all bathed in the smoke

45:57.954 --> 46:00.823
from Douglas fir cones.

46:13.464 --> 46:15.937
I'd like to speak to the chef.

46:20.944 --> 46:23.505
Listen, man, can we try
to keep a low profile?

46:24.981 --> 46:26.178
My dad sells to this place.

46:26.213 --> 46:28.851
I'm not really
supposed to be in here.

46:30.052 --> 46:31.282
Sorry.

46:33.253 --> 46:34.549
It's okay.

46:36.091 --> 46:37.453
Why?

46:39.061 --> 46:41.259
Why what?

46:41.294 --> 46:43.591
Why aren't you
supposed to be in here?

46:43.626 --> 46:45.461
Oh, that's nice.

46:45.496 --> 46:47.562
You know, we just have a thing.

46:47.597 --> 46:50.840
We don't step
on each other's sales.

46:50.875 --> 46:53.502
I've got my business
and he's got his.

46:53.537 --> 46:55.537
Why don't you work for him?

46:57.079 --> 46:59.079
I will one day, you know,

46:59.114 --> 47:01.279
when I'm more established.

47:04.086 --> 47:06.086
Your dad sounds terrible.

47:06.121 --> 47:09.089
Well, you know,

47:09.124 --> 47:10.354
can't all live in the woods.

47:10.389 --> 47:12.059
I mean, it sounds like

47:12.094 --> 47:14.127
he's not very supportive.

47:14.162 --> 47:17.460
Well, he knows
that I can make it on my own.

47:17.495 --> 47:19.836
You know, in this business,
you got to...

47:21.664 --> 47:24.973
You got to...

47:25.008 --> 47:27.943
you know, I don't need help.
I don't need his help.

47:32.609 --> 47:34.543
Let me do the talking, okay?

47:34.578 --> 47:36.578
- Okay.
- Hi, I'm Chef Finway.

47:36.613 --> 47:38.217
Welcome to Eurydice.

47:38.252 --> 47:41.154
- Food is really good.
- Well, thank you.

47:41.189 --> 47:44.157
Thank you.
I'm so glad you're enjoying it.

47:44.192 --> 47:47.061
Um, we heard there were some

47:47.096 --> 47:49.932
new truffles on the menu?

47:49.967 --> 47:52.495
Well, we are planning
a few truffle dishes

47:52.530 --> 47:54.167
for the winter menu.

47:54.202 --> 47:56.103
It's--it's a--
it's a fascinating

47:56.138 --> 47:59.304
and expanding local industry
with deep roots

47:59.339 --> 48:02.043
in old-world, uh, traditions.

48:02.078 --> 48:03.605
Great.

48:06.346 --> 48:07.510
Um...

48:09.954 --> 48:11.888
I'm looking for a truffle pig.

48:14.618 --> 48:16.090
I don't--

48:16.125 --> 48:17.421
I, uh, I don't understand.

48:17.456 --> 48:19.654
I just wanna know about the pig.

48:22.461 --> 48:23.900
Tell him who you are.

48:26.630 --> 48:28.234
Come on. Tell him.

48:45.990 --> 48:47.154
Chef Feld?

48:48.586 --> 48:50.960
Oh, my God. Uh, may I?

48:52.689 --> 48:54.359
Uh, how are you?

48:54.394 --> 48:56.328
My God. You--you--you've been
off the scene for what,

48:56.363 --> 48:58.693
- uh, 10 years?
- AMIR: Fifteen.

48:58.728 --> 49:00.530
Really? Okay.

49:00.565 --> 49:03.104
I thought you were--
um, well, I mean,

49:03.139 --> 49:05.238
- the time is very, uh--
- Sure.

49:05.273 --> 49:07.537
Yeah.

49:07.572 --> 49:09.572
I'm sorry,
do you need medical attention?

49:09.607 --> 49:11.178
No. Thank you.

49:11.213 --> 49:13.312
Uh, you probably
don't remember me,

49:13.347 --> 49:15.413
but I actually worked at Hestia.

49:15.448 --> 49:17.745
You were a prep cook
for two months.

49:17.780 --> 49:19.483
Was it two months?

49:19.518 --> 49:22.486
I fired you because
you always overcooked the pasta.

49:27.295 --> 49:29.097
Ah, ah, now, this is excellent.

49:29.132 --> 49:32.199
This is a, uh, a 2012 Pinot

49:32.234 --> 49:34.267
from just 20 miles away.

49:37.602 --> 49:39.206
So do you know about the pig?

49:40.407 --> 49:41.736
Uh, why--why do you want a pig?

49:41.771 --> 49:44.013
It's my pig.

49:44.048 --> 49:45.443
Oh, okay.

49:45.478 --> 49:47.214
Uh, that--that--that's great.

49:47.249 --> 49:48.776
That's a--that's a--
that's a great business.

49:48.811 --> 49:51.020
It's a--it's a--
it's an expanding industry.

49:51.055 --> 49:53.187
- It's--it's...
- Someone stole it.

49:57.787 --> 50:01.327
I really, um,

50:01.362 --> 50:03.362
I respect you, Chef,
I always have.

50:03.397 --> 50:05.166
But I'm running a business here

50:05.201 --> 50:08.433
and people have expectations,

50:08.468 --> 50:13.207
uh, critics,
uh, investors, so forth.

50:13.242 --> 50:15.770
And, uh, truffles
are-are-are-are a key part

50:15.805 --> 50:19.180
of the whole, uh, concept
of the winter menu

50:19.215 --> 50:23.184
and--and they need to be
the top of the line.

50:23.219 --> 50:25.252
So you understand.

50:25.287 --> 50:27.518
I--I have--I have
the utmost respect for you,

50:27.553 --> 50:29.025
utmost.

50:39.796 --> 50:42.335
What is the...

50:42.370 --> 50:44.172
concept here?

50:48.277 --> 50:50.343
Um, well, uh,

50:50.378 --> 50:53.346
we're interested
in taking local ingredients,

50:53.381 --> 50:54.842
uh, native to this region

50:54.877 --> 50:57.383
and--and just
deconstructing them,

50:57.418 --> 51:01.585
you know, making
the--the familiar feel foreign,

51:01.620 --> 51:03.257
thereby giving us, uh,

51:03.292 --> 51:06.491
an even greater appreciation
of food as a whole.

51:06.526 --> 51:08.658
This is the kind
of cooking you like?

51:08.693 --> 51:10.330
It's cutting-edge,

51:10.365 --> 51:12.827
- it's very exciting.
- Exciting.

51:12.862 --> 51:14.730
Uh, I mean, everybody loves it.

51:19.440 --> 51:21.473
You like cooking it?

51:22.806 --> 51:25.477
- Absolutely.
- Derek,

51:25.512 --> 51:29.580
what was it you always
used to talk about opening?

51:29.615 --> 51:31.087
Wasn't it a pub?

51:33.784 --> 51:35.322
Every-everyone loves it here.

51:35.357 --> 51:36.851
It's a--this is a huge success.

51:36.886 --> 51:38.820
Why didn't you open your pub?

51:38.855 --> 51:41.493
I--I don't--

51:41.528 --> 51:44.298
I don't know that
I--I really wanted,

51:44.333 --> 51:46.762
uh, I mean--I mean, it's such--
that was such a long time ago.

51:46.797 --> 51:49.732
When I fired you, I asked you
what you wanted to do.

51:49.767 --> 51:52.504
You said you have
a few rooms upstairs,

51:52.539 --> 51:55.408
a real English pub.

51:55.443 --> 51:57.410
That--did I--I say that?

51:57.445 --> 52:00.182
- Yes.
- Nobody wants pubs around here.

52:00.217 --> 52:04.186
It's a--that's-that's-that's
a terrible investment.

52:04.221 --> 52:06.452
What was going to be
your signature dish?

52:06.487 --> 52:09.257
Liver scotch eggs
with a honey curry mustard.

52:14.297 --> 52:16.429
They're not real.

52:16.464 --> 52:18.464
You get that, right?

52:18.499 --> 52:20.763
None of it is real.

52:20.798 --> 52:22.798
The critics aren't real,

52:22.833 --> 52:25.438
the customers aren't real

52:25.473 --> 52:29.442
because this isn't real.

52:29.477 --> 52:30.806
You aren't real.

52:31.941 --> 52:33.908
What...

52:33.943 --> 52:36.284
Okay.

52:36.319 --> 52:38.748
Derek, why do you care
about this people?

52:38.783 --> 52:41.718
They don't care about you,
none of them.

52:41.753 --> 52:44.259
They don't even know you

52:44.294 --> 52:46.690
because you haven't shown them.

52:47.990 --> 52:50.364
Every day you wake up

52:50.399 --> 52:52.498
and there'll be less of you.

52:52.533 --> 52:54.665
You live your life for them

52:54.700 --> 52:56.865
and they don't even see you.

52:56.900 --> 52:59.571
You don't even see yourself.

53:03.544 --> 53:06.446
We don't get a lot of things
to really care about.

53:41.879 --> 53:45.815
Derek, who has my pig?

53:56.333 --> 53:59.268
He's not somebody
you wanna make angry.

54:03.670 --> 54:05.439
He will be angry.

54:09.973 --> 54:12.611
Rob.

54:12.646 --> 54:15.416
Rob, it wasn't me, okay?

54:15.451 --> 54:17.550
I don't even talk to him.

54:17.585 --> 54:19.486
Open it.

54:19.521 --> 54:21.719
Rob, I didn't say shit, okay?

54:21.754 --> 54:25.492
Please,
I--I didn't even know about it.

54:25.527 --> 54:27.263
Take me to him.

54:28.728 --> 54:31.333
It's my dad, okay?

54:31.368 --> 54:32.763
It's my dad.
You don't understand.

54:32.798 --> 54:34.468
- No.
-

54:34.503 --> 54:36.305
Fuck. Stop.

54:36.340 --> 54:37.801
Stop.
What the fuck?

54:37.836 --> 54:39.572
The Camaro.
What the fuck?

54:39.607 --> 54:41.035
The Camaro. Stop.

54:41.070 --> 54:43.444
- You psycho.
- What's his address?

54:43.479 --> 54:45.314
Listen, man,
I will get you a new one.

54:45.349 --> 54:46.744
I will get you a new one.
I swear.

54:46.779 --> 54:47.811
I'll take a hit for the season.

54:47.846 --> 54:49.648
What is it?

54:51.817 --> 54:53.553
380 Northwest Willow.

54:55.557 --> 54:57.920
We're done.

54:57.955 --> 54:59.856
I don't wanna see you again.

55:01.794 --> 55:03.926
So that's it?

55:03.961 --> 55:05.433
Really?

55:06.865 --> 55:07.963
I'm right here.

55:07.998 --> 55:09.437
Man, I am right here.

55:09.472 --> 55:10.933
We can work this out.

55:12.838 --> 55:14.871
Okay. You know what? Fuck.

55:27.787 --> 55:30.821
BRITISH VOICE: All great men
are ahead of their time

55:30.856 --> 55:32.526
and then all great music,

55:32.561 --> 55:34.495
no matter when written,
you shall find

55:34.530 --> 55:35.661
- the instances of...
-

56:11.193 --> 56:12.797
AMIR: Hi, Mom.

56:18.607 --> 56:21.938
Um, I met the guy

56:21.973 --> 56:23.577
who, um...

56:25.482 --> 56:27.416
who made you that dinner.

56:29.948 --> 56:31.882
Do you remember that dinner?

56:40.189 --> 56:42.530
I actually think
you'd really like him.

56:49.165 --> 56:51.033
I don't know.

57:02.750 --> 57:05.520
Would you wish
Dad would just let you die?

57:08.624 --> 57:11.185
So do you just wish
that he'd let you die?

57:15.928 --> 57:18.500
NURSE: Excuse me.

57:18.535 --> 57:21.063
Um, I was gonna clean
her trach but...

57:21.098 --> 57:23.934
- Uh-hmm.
- ...did you wanna see her?

57:23.969 --> 57:25.199
No.

57:37.620 --> 57:39.950
DARIUS: Can I say...

57:39.985 --> 57:42.953
it's an honor meeting you?

57:42.988 --> 57:45.923
Half the restaurants in Portland
owe you a debt.

57:48.257 --> 57:50.532
I'd like my pig back.

57:55.264 --> 57:58.969
My son means well, but, uh,

57:59.004 --> 58:00.938
he's not cut out
for this business.

58:00.973 --> 58:02.808
It'll eat him alive.

58:04.009 --> 58:05.140
I mean, he'll be okay.

58:05.175 --> 58:07.142
I'll find him a nice desk job,

58:07.177 --> 58:10.519
something out of the way.
That's really where he belongs.

58:11.819 --> 58:12.950
I don't care.

58:15.823 --> 58:17.790
You know, he, uh,

58:17.825 --> 58:22.190
he told me the first day
that he met you

58:22.225 --> 58:24.995
was actually sweet.

58:25.030 --> 58:28.504
And I didn't think the business
would take off, but...

58:29.705 --> 58:32.640
here I am with egg on my face.

58:35.942 --> 58:37.843
But I think now it's time
for somebody who knows

58:37.878 --> 58:39.141
what they're doing to take over.

58:39.176 --> 58:42.144
I want my pig back.

58:42.179 --> 58:45.752
Yeah. I'll give you $15,000
to walk away.

58:45.787 --> 58:47.281
- No.
- Twenty thousand.

58:47.316 --> 58:49.657
- No.
- Twenty million?

58:55.291 --> 58:57.698
I control myself very well,

58:57.733 --> 59:00.096
but I don't think
you understand what I am.

59:02.166 --> 59:05.068
From the very first moment
my son started selling for you,

59:05.103 --> 59:07.037
you've been in my world.

59:07.072 --> 59:10.304
This whole time,
all these years,

59:10.339 --> 59:13.208
Edgar, Finway,

59:13.243 --> 59:15.848
those tweaked out fucks,

59:15.883 --> 59:18.279
they're mine.

59:18.314 --> 59:21.282
That's just how it is.

59:21.317 --> 59:24.120
You have nothing
to bargain with.

59:26.190 --> 59:29.631
Now I will have
$25,000 delivered

59:29.666 --> 59:32.601
to that little campground
of yours tomorrow.

59:34.198 --> 59:36.330
If I see you again,

59:36.365 --> 59:38.904
you do anything to fuck with me,

59:38.939 --> 59:41.874
I will chop that pig up
into bacon.

59:43.306 --> 59:45.240
I can buy another one.

59:46.980 --> 59:48.914
Now get out of my house.

59:51.820 --> 59:53.347
Were you always like this...

59:53.382 --> 59:56.317
or was it just after she died?

1:00:00.697 --> 1:00:01.795
Were you?

1:00:06.098 --> 1:00:09.297
You made the right choice

1:00:09.332 --> 1:00:11.398
being out there in the woods.

1:00:11.433 --> 1:00:13.268
You had your moment,

1:00:13.303 --> 1:00:16.040
but there's nothing here
for you anymore.

1:00:16.075 --> 1:00:18.680
There's really nothing here
for most of us.

1:00:18.715 --> 1:00:21.111
You don't keep a grip on it,

1:00:21.146 --> 1:00:23.817
that's pretty much it.

1:00:25.348 --> 1:00:27.117
Buy yourself a new pig.

1:01:16.498 --> 1:01:18.806
I thought
you might need your ride.

1:01:21.239 --> 1:01:22.810
I have a bike.

1:01:24.979 --> 1:01:26.913
I'm sorry I told him about you.

1:01:30.248 --> 1:01:32.182
I really didn't know
he'd take her.

1:02:04.282 --> 1:02:07.217
I don't need my pig
to find truffles.

1:02:09.287 --> 1:02:11.518
What?

1:02:11.553 --> 1:02:12.992
The trees.

1:02:15.161 --> 1:02:17.095
The trees tell you
where to look.

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.396
Then why the fuck
did we do all this?

1:02:28.306 --> 1:02:30.075
I love her.

1:02:50.933 --> 1:02:52.295
Do you have a pen?

1:02:52.330 --> 1:02:54.297
What?

1:02:54.332 --> 1:02:56.266
I have to write something.

1:03:00.470 --> 1:03:02.041
Um...

1:03:08.115 --> 1:03:10.478
well, if the city floods,
we can always go up

1:03:10.513 --> 1:03:12.546
to Mount Hood.

1:03:12.581 --> 1:03:14.350
Hood's an active volcano.

1:03:18.521 --> 1:03:21.093
Well, I'm not fucking
moving to Seattle.

1:03:21.128 --> 1:03:22.292
Fuck Seattle.

1:03:24.296 --> 1:03:25.933
I'm gonna need you
to drop me off

1:03:25.968 --> 1:03:28.067
and go and get everything
on that list.

1:03:29.532 --> 1:03:31.037
I can't get all these stuff.

1:03:31.072 --> 1:03:32.500
Check in with the names.

1:03:32.535 --> 1:03:33.435
Tell them you're with me.

1:03:37.639 --> 1:03:39.243
You want me to use your name?

1:03:48.518 --> 1:03:50.287
Should I even ask
what we're doing?

1:03:52.159 --> 1:03:54.456
We're getting my pig back.

1:04:29.526 --> 1:04:31.031
JEZEBEL: Can I help you?

1:04:31.066 --> 1:04:34.067
AMIR:
Hi. Um, I'm looking for Jezebel.

1:04:35.631 --> 1:04:37.873
You'll have to schedule
an appointment.

1:04:40.944 --> 1:04:42.372
Robin Feld sent me.

1:05:13.603 --> 1:05:15.108
Are these all yours?

1:05:15.143 --> 1:05:19.112
Well, now, yes.

1:05:19.147 --> 1:05:22.577
They used to belong
to Robin and Laurie.

1:05:26.154 --> 1:05:27.582
Who's Laurie?

1:05:39.464 --> 1:05:41.695
He didn't ask me to

1:05:41.730 --> 1:05:44.665
but I'm saving
the one next to it for him.

1:05:46.735 --> 1:05:48.944
You tell him that, okay?

1:06:01.189 --> 1:06:03.057
ROB:
You made it a bakery?

1:06:06.194 --> 1:06:07.589
HELEN:
I'm a baker.

1:06:10.528 --> 1:06:13.364
I kept it the same
for a couple years.

1:06:15.599 --> 1:06:17.566
I thought maybe you'd come
take it back...

1:06:20.769 --> 1:06:22.010
but you didn't.

1:06:23.211 --> 1:06:26.982
And, um, it wasn't me,

1:06:30.548 --> 1:06:32.086
you're a chef,

1:06:33.419 --> 1:06:34.990
I'm a baker.

1:06:42.428 --> 1:06:47.002
Do you still make
your salted baguette?

1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:53.305
Robin...

1:06:59.379 --> 1:07:01.115
I do still make it.

1:07:04.483 --> 1:07:05.779
The same recipe?

1:07:07.090 --> 1:07:08.452
Same recipe.

1:07:13.756 --> 1:07:15.294
Do you have a loaf?

1:08:01.243 --> 1:08:02.704
Can I have another?

1:08:31.570 --> 1:08:32.668
Bye, chef.

1:08:44.913 --> 1:08:46.715
You got rid of the curtains?

1:08:48.653 --> 1:08:50.521
Laurie always wanted to.

1:08:52.756 --> 1:08:54.228
This is better.

1:11:34.687 --> 1:11:35.785
Dad?

1:11:38.020 --> 1:11:39.921
Dad, can you come out here?

1:11:41.859 --> 1:11:43.397
We made you dinner.

1:11:45.929 --> 1:11:47.665
You can leave.

1:12:00.878 --> 1:12:02.416
We made you dinner.

1:12:30.446 --> 1:12:31.742
Thank you.

1:12:55.438 --> 1:12:56.965
ROB:
Your son found this.

1:14:50.982 --> 1:14:52.113
Hmm.

1:15:39.162 --> 1:15:40.634
Get out.

1:15:45.168 --> 1:15:46.739
Please get out.

1:15:50.008 --> 1:15:51.073
Get out!

1:15:51.108 --> 1:15:52.778
Get out of my house!

1:15:52.813 --> 1:15:54.175
Get out!

1:15:59.050 --> 1:16:03.558
I remember every meal
I ever cooked.

1:16:05.958 --> 1:16:09.025
I remember every person

1:16:09.060 --> 1:16:10.697
I ever served.

1:16:15.363 --> 1:16:17.671
Why are you doing this?

1:16:38.386 --> 1:16:40.628
I'm sorry.
But, um...

1:16:44.931 --> 1:16:46.898
by the time I got it,

1:16:48.264 --> 1:16:51.397
these waste of space junkies,

1:16:51.432 --> 1:16:52.805
they...

1:16:55.172 --> 1:16:56.941
They were too rough,

1:17:00.045 --> 1:17:03.343
we couldn't--

1:17:06.315 --> 1:17:07.886
she died.

1:18:51.420 --> 1:18:53.057
What can I get you two?

1:18:55.523 --> 1:18:57.325
What pie do you have today?

1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:58.997
WAITRESS:
We don't do pie.

1:19:00.231 --> 1:19:01.296
AMIR:
You don't do pie?

1:19:02.365 --> 1:19:04.200
We have chocolate chip cookies,

1:19:04.235 --> 1:19:06.169
cheesecake, and brownies.

1:19:06.204 --> 1:19:07.104
All right.

1:19:07.139 --> 1:19:08.941
We'll get two brownies.

1:19:08.976 --> 1:19:10.338
We'll have some coffee too.

1:19:10.373 --> 1:19:11.779
Cream and sugar?

1:19:11.814 --> 1:19:12.846
Sure.

1:19:25.828 --> 1:19:27.058
What are you thinking?

1:19:31.460 --> 1:19:33.427
I was thinking

1:19:39.237 --> 1:19:41.941
if I never came looking for her,

1:19:44.011 --> 1:19:45.274
in my head,

1:19:47.311 --> 1:19:49.080
she'd still be alive.

1:19:55.253 --> 1:19:56.824
But she wouldn't be.

1:20:25.151 --> 1:20:26.414
No, she wouldn't.

1:20:50.011 --> 1:20:51.043
You okay?

1:20:57.018 --> 1:20:58.578
I think I'm gonna walk.

1:21:04.289 --> 1:21:05.585
You okay?

1:21:13.562 --> 1:21:14.627
Yeah.

1:21:44.593 --> 1:21:46.263
I'll see you Thursday?

1:21:46.298 --> 1:21:47.528
Yeah.

1:22:09.717 --> 1:22:12.124
RADIO DJ: ...shall not be
difficult for him to recognize

1:22:12.159 --> 1:22:15.523
the three elements
on which music rests,

1:22:15.558 --> 1:22:19.065
melody, harmony, and rhythm.

1:22:19.100 --> 1:22:22.233
Can he recognize them
with sufficient...

1:25:42.600 --> 1:25:44.765
WOMAN:
Hey, no.

1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:47.438
Stop.

1:25:51.774 --> 1:25:53.312
So I know we're going

1:25:53.347 --> 1:25:54.808
to a really fancy restaurant
tonight

1:25:54.843 --> 1:25:57.514
and you're gonna complain
about the food,

1:25:57.549 --> 1:26:00.352
and I'm gonna have
to get really drunk

1:26:00.387 --> 1:26:01.815
to deal with it.

1:26:01.850 --> 1:26:04.554
But it's your birthday

1:26:04.589 --> 1:26:06.292
and I love you.

1:26:06.327 --> 1:26:08.393
This song reminds me of you.

1:26:08.428 --> 1:26:09.790
Happy Birthday.

1:26:27.579 --> 1:26:30.679
Hey, little girl,
is your daddy home?

1:26:30.714 --> 1:26:35.255
and leave you all alone?

1:26:50.536 --> 1:26:53.504
is he good to you?

1:26:53.539 --> 1:26:57.244
the things that I do?

1:27:38.045 --> 1:27:40.782
took a knife

1:27:40.817 --> 1:27:44.016
and cut a six-inch valley

1:27:44.051 --> 1:27:47.261
of my skull

1:27:48.957 --> 1:27:52.332
with the sheets soaking wet

1:27:52.367 --> 1:27:55.566
through the middle of my head
