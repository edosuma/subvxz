WEBVTT

00:19.770 --> 00:22.940
For tomorrow. Your wedding day.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.693
It's exquisite.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.197
If you think I'm giving it to you
to underline the sense of occasion

00:30.197 --> 00:33.742
and history tomorrow represents,
whilst also intimidating you,

00:34.826 --> 00:36.328
you're entirely correct.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.290
Well, the point
has been clearly underlined.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.376
Theo is the main event tonight.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.212
You can stand silently by his side.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.715
Which is the job, of course.

00:49.424 --> 00:52.386
To smile, to wave, perhaps.

00:53.262 --> 00:56.515
To bestow your presence
on the odd agricultural prize-giving.

00:56.515 --> 01:00.519
But decisions,
even those which affect you both,

01:00.519 --> 01:03.397
from now on, aren't yours to make.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.692
I'm not a monster, Nan.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.863
I liked you very much when we met.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.156
But you lied to us.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.367
Your display at Christmas,

01:15.367 --> 01:18.704
your determination to speak
when your opinion has not been asked.

01:18.704 --> 01:22.875
- And your urging of Theo to disrespect--
- I haven't urged Theo to do anything.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.630
His father and I worked hard
for the family reputation.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.756
And I am not trying--

01:29.756 --> 01:32.301
Theodore insists
he won't reconsider the marriage.

01:32.301 --> 01:35.512
So, tomorrow,
we host the wedding of the season,

01:36.513 --> 01:37.973
perhaps the decade.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.642
If you were to change your mind now,

01:41.727 --> 01:44.771
particularly now your background
is so well-known,

01:46.481 --> 01:48.525
Theo would be a laughingstock.

01:48.525 --> 01:53.864
And for my honest, loyal, openhearted son
to be a laughingstock

01:54.531 --> 01:55.741
would break my heart.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.828
But for it to happen
to the Duke of Tintagel,

02:01.121 --> 02:04.249
would undermine his position
for the rest of his life.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.131
An anxious bride is far from
a new phenomenon.

02:13.425 --> 02:17.304
I gave you the opportunity to leave
on Christmas Day, and you refused.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.514
So, now,

02:18.514 --> 02:21.475
you must work through
those pre-wedding nerves,

02:21.475 --> 02:25.562
wear the tiara and stand tall by his side.

02:26.605 --> 02:27.648
Like a duchess.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.896
After you, my lady.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.694
Nan.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.699
- Open wide.
- Oh, come on! Come on!

04:00.699 --> 04:02.159
Nan! Nan! Nan! Nan!

04:02.159 --> 04:04.494
Yes! Oh, my gosh.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.662
That really hurt.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.545
Tomorrow, it'll all be yours.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.604
We ought to stop avoiding each other.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.192
This.

04:36.902 --> 04:37.903
Tonight.

04:38.695 --> 04:42.157
None of it feels the way the night before
your wedding is supposed to feel.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.618
Well, I think that there's a lot
of nonsense talked about weddings.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.828
- And how you're supposed to--
- Are you in love with Guy?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.167
No.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.503
Do you still want to marry me?

05:02.261 --> 05:04.346
You will be asked that question tomorrow.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.975
You and I have put on
enough public performances.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.311
And, Nan, I love you.

05:12.271 --> 05:15.524
But I won't wait here tomorrow with
a packed church and the world watching.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.234
Not if you're not sure.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.577
So, first thing in the morning,
let me know your decision.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.547
Tomorrow I shall watch my son marry.

05:39.423 --> 05:44.720
So, I shall step aside and no longer
be the Duchess of Tintagel.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.764
I struggle to accept my new title,
of course,

05:47.764 --> 05:51.768
as surely the Dowager Duchess
is my elderly mother-in-law.

05:53.729 --> 05:56.523
But I accept the new role with pride,

05:56.523 --> 06:01.028
because it means my son
has fulfilled the role he was born for.

06:01.028 --> 06:04.406
Now, may I present the Duke.

06:10.412 --> 06:13.916
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.043
And to my mother

06:16.043 --> 06:18.921
for agreeing to share the title
of Most Important Woman In My Life.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.632
But tomorrow...

06:28.222 --> 06:29.223
Wow.

06:31.892 --> 06:32.976
Sorry.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.731
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.109
Excuse me. Sorry, I'm so sorry.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.033
Tomorrow Tintagel welcomes a new era.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.410
And I welcome the woman

06:50.410 --> 06:53.372
with whom I very much hope
to spend the rest of my days.

06:54.456 --> 06:58.961
Whose strength, courage
and resilience we've already seen.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.466
But who, I have no doubt,

07:04.466 --> 07:09.972
will soon demonstrate her commitment,
loyalty and willingness to serve.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.808
The new Duchess of Tintagel,

07:13.725 --> 07:16.812
by my side, just as the last has been.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.289
Letter for you, Lady Marable.

07:36.915 --> 07:37.916
Thank you.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.546
You know,
I can just stay in here until you leave.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.631
I'm not leaving.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.593
Nan, I wanted t--

08:30.511 --> 08:32.596
I really don't wanna hear you say sorry.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.015
I'm happy for you.

08:35.807 --> 08:39.144
Theo is a gentleman,
and he'll look after you.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.313
Well, I don't need looking after.

08:42.648 --> 08:45.776
Well, we all do. Sometimes.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.570
Jinny, I'm sure it's cold and lonely
in your world.

08:48.570 --> 08:52.324
All you ever do is look after yourself,
and that's the end of it.

08:53.325 --> 08:56.620
The moment we got off that boat,
all you ever wanted was to find a man.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.749
And the moment you did,
you became a completely new person.

09:02.251 --> 09:06.171
Your whole face has changed.
And I can't bear to look at it.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.715
We're going to Scotland, for good.

09:09.842 --> 09:12.761
Tomorrow, as soon as the wedding's over.
The carriage is all packed.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.805
And what difference will Scotland make?

09:15.931 --> 09:17.558
You're already so far away.

09:35.784 --> 09:36.869
Would you excuse me?

09:37.578 --> 09:38.579
Chita.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.331
I looked in on Minnie and she was sleeping
with her hands like this.

09:42.124 --> 09:43.417
I love her so much.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.128
Still there, is she? The baby.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.757
Her name's Minnie.
And I was checking on her.

09:50.757 --> 09:54.011
Babies are best left to either sleep
or cry it out.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.055
What about adults?

09:58.724 --> 10:02.144
Honoria,
would you like to join us for a drink?

10:02.144 --> 10:04.730
Honoria is happy to stand
and take in the room, thank you.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.773
She doesn't believe
in drawing attention to herself.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.817
I'm sorry.
Might Honoria speak for herself?

10:09.818 --> 10:12.529
And might you perhaps resist
making Conchita feel uncomfortable?

10:12.529 --> 10:16.366
Your wife has a great deal to learn
about our ability in this country

10:16.366 --> 10:18.827
- to stand upright in the face of--
- Upright?

10:19.578 --> 10:21.455
I may never have stood upright,

10:22.456 --> 10:24.750
except for a few months last summer
in New York with Conchita.

10:24.750 --> 10:28.629
And in fact, sort of strange feeling in
the backs of my shoulder blades right now.

10:28.629 --> 10:29.922
What is this?

10:32.049 --> 10:33.550
Might almost feel like dignity.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.052
Oh, come on.

10:35.052 --> 10:39.431
For my entire life, Mother,
you've avoided checking on me.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.434
You've chosen silence.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.645
We're stepping back from all of this.

10:45.145 --> 10:50.817
So, I am happy to now remove every last
shred of joy and noise from your home.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.820
My family and I
will no longer be part of yours.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.074
Well, good luck, entirely on your own.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.034
I am severing ties, Mother.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.579
Full financial independence on both sides.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.874
I'm putting my family first.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.631
And don't be tempted to check on me later

11:12.631 --> 11:16.051
as my wife and I intend not to be upright
for much more of this evening.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.474
Anything you'd like to add, my love?

11:23.892 --> 11:25.602
I have never loved your son more.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.072
- I'll get you a drink.
- Get me a drink now.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.124
- Bedtime. The party's over.
- What? What's wrong?

11:47.124 --> 11:49.251
Your friend is causing a scene again.

11:49.251 --> 11:54.590
- Please, I just need to-- I just--
- Virginia, come on. Stop-- Jinny?

11:55.507 --> 11:56.508
Jinny?

11:59.011 --> 12:00.012
Jinny.

12:01.013 --> 12:03.807
From now on, it's just the three of us.

12:04.892 --> 12:08.020
Yeah, we can buy our own house.
We can spend long stretches in Europe.

12:08.020 --> 12:12.149
Oh, Conchita, the feeling! This feeling
of having no duty or expectation.

12:12.941 --> 12:13.942
Dicky...

12:18.405 --> 12:21.325
It's all gone. Everything.

12:21.825 --> 12:22.910
What do you mean?

12:26.038 --> 12:29.208
There's a list of excuses here from Daddy.
But the fact is...

12:30.501 --> 12:32.336
his big investment--

12:32.336 --> 12:34.880
He made some mistakes.
And he lost all of his money.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.424
Our money.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.471
Breaking away from your family is fine
when we had money.

12:42.471 --> 12:46.475
But now, how are we gonna live?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.311
Well, it won't be easy.

12:52.648 --> 12:55.817
But I love you.
And honestly, what else matters?

12:57.027 --> 12:58.695
- And we can do anything.
- Yeah.

12:59.196 --> 13:01.657
We can start again.
This means we are properly free.

13:01.657 --> 13:02.741
- Yes!
- Of all of them.

13:02.741 --> 13:05.202
No money, no ties, just us.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.913
- Just us and Minnie.
- We can live.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.541
The three of us can just live.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.510
She's sleeping.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.055
Too much heat and noise, that's all.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.016
It's common to find
this kind of event overwhelming.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.060
And a woman in her condition...

13:31.562 --> 13:32.980
Congratulations to you both.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.402
- I'd rather you didn't...
- I quite understand.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.070
It's your news to tell.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.425
Sticking with this whole
made-up headache thing, are you?

14:02.176 --> 14:06.763
Patti, we should be on top of the world.
Both daughters settled with their titles.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.684
And you and me, we are
the Duke and Duchess of Madison Avenue.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.978
The whole world envies our family.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.813
Our family no longer exists.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.775
The girls will be in England.
And what will we do, Tracy?

14:18.775 --> 14:21.403
Whatever the hell we want, Patti.

14:21.403 --> 14:25.824
Well, I believe I'm the only one
who will find that a novelty.

14:27.451 --> 14:30.329
Patti, if it is adventures you want,
then the moment we get back

14:30.329 --> 14:33.290
- to New York, we'll have all the adve--
- I don't belong in New York!

14:33.290 --> 14:36.460
I've had my fill
of being your audience at parties.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.086
I have never been enough for you.

14:38.086 --> 14:41.965
But what has changed
is you are no longer enough for me.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.260
I'm not scared of the scandal of divorce.

14:45.886 --> 14:50.474
As the mother of a duchess,
I will have options and invitations.

14:50.474 --> 14:52.809
And I can have all the adventures I want.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.019
Patti, we have be--

14:54.520 --> 14:56.021
I wanted to talk to you.

14:59.358 --> 15:00.442
Yeah, I need a drink.

15:04.154 --> 15:07.658
This country has put ideas into her head.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.785
You know,
I've always had ideas in my head.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.789
It's only now I realize
people might wanna hear them.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.299
Do you regret marrying Daddy?

15:24.299 --> 15:28.053
No, because I wouldn't
have had you girls, but now...

15:28.053 --> 15:29.471
I need to...

15:32.766 --> 15:34.476
refind my spark.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.062
Do you understand?

15:39.231 --> 15:41.149
I believe I can see that spark already.

15:43.485 --> 15:45.028
Well, you gave me that gift.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.907
You marrying Theo lets me be myself again.

15:50.117 --> 15:54.621
Even the scandal of divorce won't shut out
the mother of a duchess from society.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.833
Now, what did you come here
to talk to me about?

16:04.089 --> 16:05.090
It's...

16:11.180 --> 16:12.181
Annabel.

16:14.349 --> 16:15.601
You're sure, are you?

16:17.477 --> 16:20.814
Are you quite sure about tomorrow?

16:22.441 --> 16:26.778
Because you mustn't feel--
with the grandness of it all,

16:27.821 --> 16:30.699
you mustn't feel pressured.

16:30.699 --> 16:33.785
No. No, of course not.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.412
And I'm-- I am sure.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.248
I just need some sleep.

16:39.249 --> 16:42.002
I'll see you tomorrow. I love you.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.505
I love you.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.259
To us being next.

17:31.802 --> 17:36.139
- Yes. At some stage.
- Whatever comes after.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.184
I mean,
I guess for us that's the joy of it.

17:39.184 --> 17:43.522
After the wedding
we get to just be as we are.

17:46.275 --> 17:47.693
Until the children come along.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.073
I assume, we'll--

17:54.533 --> 17:59.162
Even a convenient marriage
can continue the line and--

18:02.499 --> 18:03.500
Definitely.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.137
What are we--

18:15.888 --> 18:19.349
You look so frightened. What's happened?

18:21.143 --> 18:22.394
This is how I am.

18:23.604 --> 18:26.273
This is how I've always been underneath,

18:27.941 --> 18:29.484
but I don't want to be anymore.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.653
I feel broken.

18:33.322 --> 18:35.240
What do you mean "broken"?

18:37.576 --> 18:38.869
When we were little,

18:39.953 --> 18:45.417
the way you and others looked at boys
and got butterflies,

18:45.417 --> 18:47.252
like with Harry Hamilton.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.671
Do you remember the blushing you all did?

18:49.671 --> 18:52.174
Harry Hamilton
was the fastest runner in town.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.383
Well, for me,

18:53.383 --> 18:55.844
I know I should have had butterflies
about Harry Hamilton.

18:57.429 --> 18:58.764
That's what's normal.

19:00.599 --> 19:01.600
But I never did.

19:03.477 --> 19:04.686
I had those feelings...

19:08.148 --> 19:11.652
I have those feelings about girls.

19:14.613 --> 19:18.450
And I tried to be like you,
but I'm just not.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.453
Mother walked in on me...

19:22.621 --> 19:24.164
in New York with a maid.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.794
She looked at me like I was a monster.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.547
Mabel, I'm so sorry.

19:33.590 --> 19:34.842
What did she say?

19:36.218 --> 19:40.889
She just walked back out
like I was nothing.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.434
Mabel, listen to me.

19:46.645 --> 19:50.607
Listen, you're talking about...

19:54.361 --> 19:55.404
love.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.871
How can love ever be wrong?

20:04.371 --> 20:07.207
If that's what gives you butterflies,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.586
then you are exactly
who you're supposed to be.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.590
You're Mabel. You're beautiful.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.594
- You're not disgusted?
- Darling.

20:20.762 --> 20:21.805
Shame.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.558
You have to try and let that go.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.022
You're too lovely to be ruined.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.401
Thank you for telling me.

20:39.990 --> 20:40.991
Hold on.

20:43.577 --> 20:46.330
- Which maid?
- Well, not Martha.

20:46.830 --> 20:47.831
She's 80.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.065
We agreed no more secrets.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.530
I wanted to tell you.

21:24.326 --> 21:27.204
Yet you seem to delight
in separating yourself from me, Jinny.

21:27.913 --> 21:30.499
- Stopping me looking after you.
- I didn't mean to keep it a secret.

21:30.499 --> 21:32.835
- I just-- I didn't mean to keep it a se--
- I expect Nan knows?

21:32.835 --> 21:34.169
- No, she doesn't.
- About the baby?

21:34.169 --> 21:36.255
- Nobody does.
- Is it mine?

21:37.297 --> 21:38.924
- Of course.
- That's what I wonder.

21:38.924 --> 21:40.175
Because why the secrets?

21:40.175 --> 21:43.387
I'm so sorry. I should have told you.
Are you pleased?

21:44.012 --> 21:45.097
Am I pleased?

21:48.058 --> 21:49.476
That my wife tells me lies?

21:51.520 --> 21:54.481
I think "ashamed" is a better word.

22:09.538 --> 22:12.040
I'm sorry.

22:27.431 --> 22:28.473
Guy.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.435
This was so much easier to climb
when I was 15.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.739
Can we pretend I did that
in a more elegant way?

22:53.081 --> 22:55.250
- Theo thinks you're ill.
- No, he doesn't.

22:57.836 --> 22:58.837
No, he doesn't.

23:03.842 --> 23:06.553
I've called it off with Jean.

23:09.056 --> 23:10.182
She deserves better.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.312
- Than you?
- Well, certainly.

23:18.190 --> 23:21.318
But mainly than someone who's...

23:25.197 --> 23:26.365
hopelessly,

23:27.824 --> 23:29.076
irretrievably,

23:29.868 --> 23:32.246
overpoweringly in love with you.

23:34.790 --> 23:35.624
Don't say that.

23:35.624 --> 23:37.417
If I've learned anything
from you Americans,

23:37.417 --> 23:40.254
it's that when you think something
you should say it out loud.

23:40.254 --> 23:44.216
And we English have a cup of tea
then decide to keep it to ourselves.

23:44.216 --> 23:45.300
But this?

23:45.300 --> 23:47.094
I'd like to tell the entire world.

23:49.847 --> 23:50.848
God, Nan,

23:52.140 --> 23:55.853
I spend the entire time I'm not with you

23:55.853 --> 23:58.856
trying to convince myself
that I must just be making it up.

24:00.065 --> 24:01.775
The amount I love you.

24:01.775 --> 24:05.654
The amount I actually physically need you.

24:06.530 --> 24:11.243
Then I'm with you and I look at your face...

24:12.911 --> 24:14.329
and your skin...

24:17.791 --> 24:18.959
and your neck...

24:25.465 --> 24:26.466
and your mouth.

24:43.567 --> 24:44.610
What about Theo?

24:45.235 --> 24:46.445
Listen, Nan.

24:47.696 --> 24:51.450
I want Theo to be happy
more than anything.

24:54.203 --> 24:58.790
Except maybe not quite as much,

24:59.750 --> 25:01.793
not as desperately as I want you to be.

25:04.171 --> 25:06.048
- So, I wanted to ask-- Why I came--
- Please don't.

25:06.048 --> 25:08.300
There's just been so much talk
about marriage.

25:08.300 --> 25:09.676
Oh, God. No, no.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.802
That's not what I'm asking.

25:14.181 --> 25:15.224
And listen, Nan.

25:16.433 --> 25:17.768
I think this is forever.

25:20.646 --> 25:23.148
God, I feel it every minute.

25:24.900 --> 25:26.151
It is all I feel.

25:28.278 --> 25:32.699
But for now, I just-- For now, I just--

25:33.742 --> 25:35.494
Let's just let it be for now.

25:41.291 --> 25:44.419
I'm going away. Tomorrow.

25:45.504 --> 25:47.923
Because the thought of you both,
I just shan't stand it.

25:49.007 --> 25:53.887
So, Brazil at first and then, who knows?

25:54.388 --> 25:57.766
And those pins that I had in my globe,
I want to see it all. Come with me.

25:57.766 --> 25:58.976
What?

25:58.976 --> 26:02.729
I feel miserable asking this.
But one thing I can't risk is not asking.

26:04.439 --> 26:05.858
And now you're just looking at me.

26:07.693 --> 26:10.112
I can't tell if you're thinking
that you'll never--

26:10.112 --> 26:11.238
Yes.

26:11.738 --> 26:12.739
To what?

26:12.739 --> 26:14.575
Yes to all of it.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.172
Someone's here.

27:53.298 --> 27:54.299
Someone's here.

27:54.800 --> 27:55.801
Just a moment.

28:03.642 --> 28:04.643
Nan.

28:06.311 --> 28:08.730
Nan, I think I need your help.

28:10.816 --> 28:11.900
Oh, Jinny.

28:14.444 --> 28:16.446
- Okay, well, I'll go get Mother.
- No.

28:16.446 --> 28:18.907
She'll go straight to Seadown,
and she wouldn't be able to help herself.

28:18.907 --> 28:21.535
And then she'd tell Daddy.
I just can't-- I don't have long.

28:21.535 --> 28:23.287
Any minute he's gonna realize
that I'm gone.

28:23.287 --> 28:25.873
Okay. It's okay, I'm here. I'm here.

28:25.873 --> 28:29.585
He's not a bad person. He's not. He just--

28:29.585 --> 28:31.753
He likes things in a particular way.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.256
Like the way that I talk and dress and,

28:34.256 --> 28:36.550
I don't know, hold a fork,
or get undressed.

28:36.550 --> 28:40.095
He just-- He likes me to be perfect.
And he just gets so angry.

28:41.013 --> 28:43.265
- It's all my fault, probably--
- It's not your fault, Jinny.

28:43.265 --> 28:44.349
It is not your fault.

28:44.349 --> 28:47.102
Nan, the fact is it's not just
gonna be two of us anymore.

28:50.314 --> 28:51.148
Really?

28:51.148 --> 28:53.442
He doesn't like me to be near anyone.

28:54.526 --> 28:56.403
What if I can't protect my baby?

28:57.070 --> 28:58.864
Well, we'll have to figure out--

28:58.864 --> 29:01.200
- We'll have to figure out-- We'll go--
- No, Nan, I can't.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.952
Wherever I go, he's gonna find me.
He's always so close--

29:09.791 --> 29:12.002
It's all right. It's just--

29:12.503 --> 29:13.712
You can come out now.

29:23.263 --> 29:26.934
You can trust him. It's okay.
Promise you, it's fine.

29:26.934 --> 29:28.143
What can I do?

29:28.727 --> 29:32.231
- Wait, the wedding...
- Well, I'll talk to Theo.

29:32.231 --> 29:34.983
But none of that matters right now.

29:35.817 --> 29:37.027
We need to get you out.

30:08.267 --> 30:11.144
Nan. Nan, I don't think
I could survive on my own.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.146
We're coming with you.

30:17.401 --> 30:18.235
Come on.

30:20.904 --> 30:22.322
What are you doing?

30:24.533 --> 30:25.534
Why are you outside?

30:26.451 --> 30:30.581
You weren't anywhere to be found.
So I came to check you hadn't wandered.

30:33.208 --> 30:34.209
No, not at all.

30:34.918 --> 30:38.005
Well, I know how you can be.
I was worried, that's all.

30:43.677 --> 30:45.262
Jinny and I, we made up.

30:45.804 --> 30:47.097
Good news, my love.

30:48.807 --> 30:51.560
I wanted to show her the chapel,
but we can just wait till the morning.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.562
- Yeah.
- I'll send you word about tomorrow.

30:53.562 --> 30:54.855
You should go to bed.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.901
And in the meantime,
Jinny and I will stick close together.

30:59.610 --> 31:01.236
And I'll make sure
she's well looked after.

31:06.742 --> 31:07.826
Good night.

31:11.455 --> 31:12.539
Night.

31:18.253 --> 31:19.463
Whose coat is this?

31:21.840 --> 31:23.759
I'm not sure.
Nan just grabbed it on the way out.

31:48.325 --> 31:49.326
Guy.

31:56.291 --> 31:57.584
Oh, Guy.

32:56.852 --> 32:58.645
- I'll take that.
- Thanks, Miss.

33:02.608 --> 33:03.650
Sorry.

33:12.451 --> 33:13.452
Honoria.

33:14.203 --> 33:16.038
Lady Honoria Marable.

33:19.374 --> 33:20.709
How big is this castle?

33:21.460 --> 33:22.669
How big is this box?

33:29.384 --> 33:33.096
I'd still like to see you.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.186
Well, once you're married,
we can wave to each other from a distance.

33:40.687 --> 33:41.980
I talked to Miles.

33:43.690 --> 33:44.691
I'm not getting married.

33:46.735 --> 33:48.862
I know you and I won't get any of this.

33:49.363 --> 33:51.615
We won't get any of their world.
Not really.

33:51.615 --> 33:55.410
Not in a way we deserve,
but perhaps if we can be brave,

33:57.037 --> 33:58.664
we can make our own world.

33:59.289 --> 34:01.124
And maybe...

34:03.126 --> 34:04.253
Maybe it'll be better.

34:12.678 --> 34:15.931
They don't know who we are,
the rest of them.

34:19.935 --> 34:23.563
But they don't need to, 'cause we do.

34:27.734 --> 34:28.735
We do.

34:31.612 --> 34:32.614
Do we?

34:38.245 --> 34:39.413
We do.

34:41.081 --> 34:42.416
- We do.
- We do. We do.

34:50.382 --> 34:51.382
We do!

35:18.493 --> 35:21.747
No, this isn't
about apologizing to your mother.

35:21.747 --> 35:24.958
- It's me. The doctors--
- Doctors?

35:26.168 --> 35:27.920
I'm afraid it's bad.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.838
I've been married
to your mother long enough

35:29.838 --> 35:31.882
to be able to withstand pain, but...

35:34.718 --> 35:37.095
They say weeks
rather than months. Damn them.

35:40.057 --> 35:42.976
They're rolling out the old
"affairs should be in order" line.

35:44.019 --> 35:47.272
Which means, of course,
it's time to step up, old boy.

35:49.191 --> 35:53.111
The estate, all the workers and so on,
all down to you.

35:57.741 --> 36:02.454
And of course, your mother,
your sister, they'll be counting on you.

36:03.997 --> 36:05.332
It's time, Richard.

36:06.583 --> 36:08.085
You'll be Lord Brightlingsea,

36:09.169 --> 36:13.423
and Conchita will be Lady Brightlingsea.

36:30.315 --> 36:31.775
I owe you an apology.

36:36.196 --> 36:40.450
I hope you know that wasn't me yesterday.

36:42.995 --> 36:44.329
I should never have...

36:49.042 --> 36:50.502
And I have a surprise.

36:55.966 --> 36:57.676
Might we put last night behind us?

37:56.527 --> 37:57.528
Trust me.

38:00.197 --> 38:02.574
- Where's Father?
- We don't need him.

38:34.940 --> 38:37.150
No bride or groom yet.

38:38.318 --> 38:40.487
Imagine if they just don't turn up.

38:40.487 --> 38:42.239
She's always been a loose cannon.

39:37.544 --> 39:39.004
Jinny, I'll be just behind that door.

39:52.476 --> 39:54.353
Go. You both have to go now.

39:54.353 --> 39:56.021
What is going on?

39:56.021 --> 39:58.607
Nan, what is the plan? This isn't--
What is going on?

39:58.607 --> 40:02.069
Jinny, listen to me.
This isn't just about you anymore.

40:02.069 --> 40:04.404
This is what mothers do. We have to go.

40:04.404 --> 40:05.489
Nan.

40:06.573 --> 40:07.574
Okay?

40:08.659 --> 40:11.078
You have the time it takes
for the three of us to walk down the aisle

40:11.078 --> 40:12.162
before he notices.

40:29.471 --> 40:33.976
Never on time. Every one of them
marches to their own drum.

40:36.728 --> 40:40.315
Your Grace, a word.

40:53.996 --> 40:55.914
We love you. We love you both.

40:55.914 --> 40:58.417
- We have to go.
- I'm so sorry, Lizzy.

40:58.417 --> 41:00.043
All of you. For everything.

41:01.170 --> 41:05.424
Essentially, we're always on our own,
don't you think, as mothers?

41:07.217 --> 41:09.052
So we must stick together.

41:09.052 --> 41:10.679
Who comes first, always?

41:10.679 --> 41:11.972
- Always.
- Always.

41:11.972 --> 41:13.223
- We come first.
- Come first.

41:13.223 --> 41:14.308
Come here.

41:16.268 --> 41:17.853
I love you guys.

41:19.605 --> 41:23.483
And I can't let you watch your son be
humiliated without some sort of warning.

41:26.987 --> 41:29.865
Theo's a good man,
and I would hate to see him--

41:31.366 --> 41:32.910
<i>But Nan would never hurt anyone</i>

41:32.910 --> 41:35.662
<i>unless it was the absolute right thing
to do.</i>

41:35.662 --> 41:37.915
Okay, Mabel, you go first.

41:39.333 --> 41:42.294
<i>This has all happened very fast
for Nan, Your Grace.</i>

41:44.171 --> 41:46.465
<i>And she cares very deeply for Theo.</i>

42:01.146 --> 42:04.608
<i>Since the news
of her father's indiscretion,</i>

42:05.359 --> 42:07.152
<i>she's had a lot of growing up to do.</i>

42:10.239 --> 42:11.823
<i>But she's really very young.</i>

42:13.325 --> 42:15.869
<i>Better, I'm sure you will agree
for both of them,</i>

42:16.411 --> 42:20.415
<i>to avoid the suffering
of a hollow marriage, a life sentence.</i>

42:20.415 --> 42:22.751
Nan, does Guy Thwarte
make your heart soar?

42:22.751 --> 42:23.710
Yes.

42:23.710 --> 42:25.420
- And your head spin?
- Yes.

42:25.420 --> 42:27.965
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Of course.

42:30.425 --> 42:32.261
So I believe Nan is not coming.

42:34.930 --> 42:38.684
Annabel is a strong-minded girl.

42:39.852 --> 42:40.936
Yes, she is.

42:40.936 --> 42:46.108
And her determination today, it seems,
is to save her sister.

42:52.072 --> 42:53.448
Do you have the boat tickets?

42:54.950 --> 42:57.077
- Come on. Get in.
- Jinny,

42:57.786 --> 43:00.706
shoulders back
and head high, okay? Go ahead, Jinny.

43:00.706 --> 43:02.749
Wait, what do you mean? What do you mean?

43:02.749 --> 43:04.793
Guy's gonna look after you, okay?
I love you.

43:04.793 --> 43:06.461
<i>One daughter's sacrifice</i>

43:07.713 --> 43:09.006
<i>for the other daughter's freedom.</i>

43:11.175 --> 43:14.511
No! Nan, you're coming with me.
You're coming with me, Nan.

43:14.511 --> 43:16.096
And miss my own wedding?

43:16.597 --> 43:18.015
Nan, but you don't even wanna get married.

43:18.015 --> 43:20.475
You never have. And you love Guy.

43:20.475 --> 43:22.936
I love you,
and I will choose you every time.

43:22.936 --> 43:24.313
Nan.

43:24.313 --> 43:26.398
- It's gonna be okay.
- Nan!

43:27.357 --> 43:30.068
- Nan, Nan. Listen.
- There's no time.

43:30.986 --> 43:33.697
You take my breath away.
I hope you know that.

43:34.364 --> 43:35.949
Ever since that first day,

43:35.949 --> 43:38.285
whenever I close my eyes
or open them even,

43:38.785 --> 43:41.914
always, it'll always be you I see.

43:42.915 --> 43:45.125
- I love you.
- I love you too.

43:45.626 --> 43:51.590
And love, deep, abiding love,
it has to win, doesn't it?

43:52.174 --> 43:53.175
Somehow.

43:54.760 --> 43:57.221
- Okay, you have to go.
- Okay.

43:59.014 --> 44:00.182
Nan.

44:01.183 --> 44:03.477
- Nan, please.
- I'll take care of her.

44:05.521 --> 44:08.065
- And you...
- I'll take care of myself, I promise.

44:08.065 --> 44:09.233
Please, Nan.

44:10.067 --> 44:11.276
I'm so sorry.

44:16.031 --> 44:19.201
I'm so sorry, Nan. Nan.

44:33.423 --> 44:35.592
<i>Nan's a clever girl too, of course.</i>

44:36.718 --> 44:39.596
<i>She understands the severity
of what Jinny is about to do.</i>

44:41.098 --> 44:46.687
<i>And a young girl running away
from her husband, taking his unborn child...</i>

44:46.687 --> 44:47.771
<i>A child?</i>

44:47.771 --> 44:50.983
She'd never make it.
It could never happen.

44:51.775 --> 44:55.863
Nan and Jinny leaving together would be
just two powerless young girls.

45:03.245 --> 45:04.746
<i>But as a duchess...</i>

45:06.623 --> 45:09.877
<i>As a duchess, Nan has absolute power
to protect her sister...</i>

45:11.211 --> 45:12.212
<i>her whole family.</i>

45:17.593 --> 45:19.428
I believe we've a wedding to attend.

45:22.598 --> 45:23.724
Don't you care,

45:24.766 --> 45:28.604
as a mother, that your son
will marry someone who can't be happy?

45:28.604 --> 45:31.607
How will they both live?
He deserves to know.

45:31.607 --> 45:33.275
Yes, but I'm not only a mother.

45:34.735 --> 45:35.736
I'm a duchess.

45:37.571 --> 45:42.701
And as Nan will see,
the Institution always comes first.

46:17.819 --> 46:19.196
Jinny.

46:22.324 --> 46:23.867
Jinny!

46:44.555 --> 46:48.725
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today in the presence of God

46:48.725 --> 46:52.938
and in sight of this congregation
to join together this man and this woman...

47:10.581 --> 47:11.582
You're too late.

47:11.582 --> 47:12.666
She's here.

47:14.251 --> 47:16.086
She's inside, Patti. Right now. Sh--

47:16.753 --> 47:18.088
She is inside the castle.

47:19.339 --> 47:20.632
Who?

47:22.050 --> 47:23.051
The mother.

47:26.013 --> 47:27.097
Nan's mother.

47:30.851 --> 47:35.480
Introducing the new Duchess of Tintagel.
