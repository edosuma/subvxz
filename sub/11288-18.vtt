WEBVTT

00:01.593 --> 00:04.370
Man, you worked up a appetite
dustin' those shoe trees, bruh.

00:04.437 --> 00:06.873
Yeah, well, when you own
78 pairs

00:06.939 --> 00:08.942
it's like dusting
a veritable forest.

00:10.076 --> 00:11.812
[knock on door]

00:11.878 --> 00:14.915
What brings you out of your
belfry this godforsaken morning?

00:16.583 --> 00:19.385
One of the knobs
fell of my dresser.

00:19.452 --> 00:22.689
Mm, well, you need
a clear finish epoxy

00:22.756 --> 00:25.859
with triple strength
melding capabilities.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.929
Uh, Krazy glue.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.102
Maxine, you have been
opening up your dresser

00:36.169 --> 00:38.839
with a rusty fork for years.
What really brings you here?

00:38.905 --> 00:40.874
You left these folded
underneath my pillow.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.175
Ooh.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.477
It did feel a bit breezy
crossing the street.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.714
So are you still on for Tuesday?

00:47.781 --> 00:50.283
Room 718, The Paramount

00:50.350 --> 00:52.919
and if you're late,
I'm starting without you.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.090
Hey, Max, you know,
I was thinking..

00:59.760 --> 01:01.201
Where, where'd Max go, man?

01:01.267 --> 01:02.803
Damn, near dislocated
my shoulder

01:02.869 --> 01:04.470
tryin' to pry this
out the box.

01:04.538 --> 01:07.808
Uh, uh, she heard the dogcatcher
and ran for cover.

01:09.475 --> 01:12.445
Anyway, look, um,
I've got to get to work.

01:12.513 --> 01:14.681
I'm tryin' to convince
Jeffrey to give me

01:14.748 --> 01:17.718
the new Hollowell account
and I've got to..

01:18.985 --> 01:21.922
...spend the day,
oh, impressing him.

01:23.423 --> 01:25.358
Why not invite your boss
over Saturday night

01:25.425 --> 01:26.727
to watch the fight?

01:26.793 --> 01:28.862
It's Frank,
the Widow Maker Muldoom

01:28.929 --> 01:31.598
vs Carlos Lullaby Lopez.

01:31.665 --> 01:35.201
Oh, well,
Jeffrey is a huge fight fan.

01:35.268 --> 01:37.538
He was taken bench when
the challengers went toe‐to‐toe

01:37.604 --> 01:40.373
after they got drunk
at the Christmas party.

01:40.440 --> 01:43.209
Hey, man,
it's only 20 bucks a pop

01:43.276 --> 01:45.979
and plus, I'm laying out
my world class buffet

01:46.046 --> 01:48.348

next to Terry Macmillan

02:26.359 --> 02:28.194
at the women‐in‐media luncheon

02:28.261 --> 02:29.896
and she didn't even
tell me about it.

02:29.963 --> 02:32.966
Hmmm. Well, that makes
two surprises.

02:33.033 --> 02:35.602
She didn't tell me either and
you're bringing our paper back.

02:37.470 --> 02:39.305
'Hey, how come you didn't
tell me about this?'

02:39.372 --> 02:41.542
You know, that you're required
to tell me everything

02:41.608 --> 02:43.777
even if doesn't degrade
or shame someone.

02:45.145 --> 02:46.913
Well, I'm so used to you
sniffin' stuff out

02:46.980 --> 02:49.650
I just stopped telling you.

02:49.716 --> 02:51.585
And here's something else
your radar missed.

02:51.652 --> 02:54.655
Last Thursday, I gave a speech
at the mayor's mansion

02:54.721 --> 02:56.690
bout New York City sweatshops,
thank you.

02:58.124 --> 03:00.133
Now why would anybody wanna
hear about your bedroom?

03:02.836 --> 03:04.204
Look at us.

03:04.270 --> 03:07.708
Speeches
and‐and celebrity lunches and..

03:11.377 --> 03:12.913
...acting.

03:12.979 --> 03:14.815
Ah, pretty soon,
we'd all be so busy

03:14.881 --> 03:16.316
we won't even know each other.

03:16.382 --> 03:17.651
I can hardly wait.

03:19.252 --> 03:21.221
Well, I guess
I have been so busy

03:21.287 --> 03:23.323
coordinating fabulous weddings.

03:23.389 --> 03:25.125
‐ Is that what you do?
‐ Yes, that's what I do.

03:27.427 --> 03:31.364
I guess I have forgotten
the, the truly important things

03:31.431 --> 03:34.467
in life like bragging
about ridin' in a cab

03:34.535 --> 03:37.037
that Denzel just got out of.

03:37.103 --> 03:40.507
Ooh, never has warm vinyl
felt so...magical.

03:42.408 --> 03:44.377
What‐what happened,
oh, what happened to the days

03:44.444 --> 03:46.913
when we used to share our lives?

03:46.980 --> 03:49.382
And‐and share our dreams
over a big old tub

03:49.449 --> 03:51.885
of rum raisin ice‐cream, mm.

03:51.952 --> 03:53.720
Yeah, you know what,
we‐we should just go out

03:53.787 --> 03:55.221
and kick it like we used to.

03:55.288 --> 03:57.023
‐ Yes.
‐ Just the girls.

03:57.090 --> 03:58.725
No Obie.

03:58.792 --> 04:00.166
No man <i>du jour.</i>

04:01.702 --> 04:03.670
No born ass diva talk.

04:04.938 --> 04:08.008
‐ No "Flavor."
‐ Well, okay.

04:08.074 --> 04:09.943
Alright, then
they're showcasing female comic

04:10.010 --> 04:11.745
Saturday night at the Cafe.

04:11.812 --> 04:14.014
I say we grab a table upfront

04:14.080 --> 04:17.551
and let somebody else make fun
of Regine for a change.

04:23.657 --> 04:27.327
Overton, string cheese
and pork rice

04:27.393 --> 04:28.929
do not belong
in the same building

04:28.995 --> 04:30.697
as sushi and shrimp, man.

04:32.365 --> 04:33.767
Look here, Kyle.

04:33.833 --> 04:37.571
If I charge my boys 20 bucks
for some bait and rice bowls

04:37.637 --> 04:41.207
I'll be the laughing stock
of PD's plumbing.

04:41.274 --> 04:44.711
Well, we wouldn't want PD
mocking us now, would we?

04:44.778 --> 04:46.312
[knock on door]

04:46.379 --> 04:47.848
Here come the crew now.

04:49.616 --> 04:51.217
Alright, now, here we go.

04:52.553 --> 04:53.520
'Kyle!'

04:54.921 --> 04:56.923
This is The Eclipse.

04:56.990 --> 04:58.925
'This right here
is my man Red Rash.'

05:01.001 --> 05:03.637
Well, I imagine they call you
The Eclipse

05:03.704 --> 05:05.572
because of your size and..

05:06.973 --> 05:10.410
I don't wanna imagine
why they call you Red Rash?

05:10.476 --> 05:13.146
‐ Overton.
‐ Alright, yeah, sky flow, baby.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.281
‐ Cha ching.
‐ Overton, can I speak to you?

05:15.348 --> 05:16.482
‐ Yeah, what's up?
‐ Look, man.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.984
I have invited my boss.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.252
Could you have
invited your friends

05:19.319 --> 05:20.954
who do not pick and scratch?

05:22.923 --> 05:24.090
They comin' too.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.960
Now you gonna love Big Snaky.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.996
Sharp dresser.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.097
Hey, uh..

05:31.164 --> 05:32.165
[knock on door]

05:33.667 --> 05:34.968
‐ Hello, Kyle.
‐ Jeffrey.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.037
I hope you don't mind.
I brought my nephews along.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.839
This is Harvey and Nathaniel.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.508
Okay. The more, the merrier.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.009
Look, I've put together

05:43.076 --> 05:45.011
a pallet‐pleasing assortment
of hors d'oeuvres.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.079
I've even tracked down

05:46.146 --> 05:48.314
an amusing bottle
of Montrachet '84.

05:48.381 --> 05:49.950
Hey!

05:50.016 --> 05:52.085
Twinkies!

05:52.152 --> 05:53.286
I didn't see no Twinkies.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.557
‐ Twinkies?
‐ Don't worry, Kyle.

05:56.623 --> 05:57.891
They'll eat your little sushi.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.993
All you gotta do is
squeeze some cheese on them.

06:01.835 --> 06:03.537
[laughter]

06:06.339 --> 06:08.408
So they call it
a training bra

06:08.474 --> 06:10.544
but what exactly
is it trainin'?

06:10.611 --> 06:12.679
And how do you know
when it's trained?

06:14.715 --> 06:16.517
Oh, do I have juice or what?

06:16.583 --> 06:17.884
Best table in the place

06:17.951 --> 06:20.253
all because I stop in
for a snack sometimes.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.321
Sometimes?

06:21.387 --> 06:23.189
Max, they named
the sandwich after you.

06:23.256 --> 06:25.058
Oh, yeah, Big Max.

06:25.125 --> 06:27.127
Hey, ooh.

06:27.193 --> 06:29.129
They got a dessert
named after me too.

06:29.195 --> 06:31.031
Alright.

06:31.097 --> 06:34.267
Uh, I hope my jokes don't
interfere with your readin'.

06:37.904 --> 06:40.440
I hope your jokes don't
interfere with my appetite.

06:43.043 --> 06:45.311
Oh, excuse me.
We didn't order this.

06:52.452 --> 06:53.920
Oh, great.

06:53.987 --> 06:57.090
Lenny, Squiggy and Potsie are
trying to mack us with snacks.

06:58.491 --> 07:01.802
Alright, now this happens
to me all the time.

07:01.868 --> 07:04.470
So just ignore them.

07:04.538 --> 07:06.707
Hi, ladies, uh, my name is Eric

07:06.773 --> 07:08.709
and uh, these are my boys Jerry

07:08.775 --> 07:10.711
and my man Vince
over here and uh..

07:13.479 --> 07:16.683
...if sexy was Oreos,
you'd be double‐stuffed, baby.

07:21.988 --> 07:23.890
And if corny was a crime,
you'd be on death row.

07:23.957 --> 07:25.659
Beat it, come on,
get up off me.

07:27.861 --> 07:30.731
Sorry about my forward friend.

07:30.797 --> 07:31.865
He doesn't know how to act

07:31.932 --> 07:33.900
when he sees a table
full of beautiful women.

07:35.201 --> 07:37.003
As attractive as I am..

07:38.505 --> 07:40.941
...we're not trying
to meet anybody, alright.

07:41.007 --> 07:43.610
Oooh, chilly.

07:43.677 --> 07:45.812
Are you as frosty
as your friend in the wig?

07:48.381 --> 07:49.650
Come here, man.

07:49.716 --> 07:52.953
Now I‐I realize that
I just, like, dissed you

07:53.019 --> 07:55.155
but to drown your sorrows
in that

07:55.221 --> 07:57.123
mnh‐mnh, come on, bro,
have some pride now.

07:58.692 --> 08:00.967
I hate to burst your bubble,
but I'm engaged.

08:02.936 --> 08:05.105
See, I'm a done deal.
I'm all locked up, brother.

08:06.406 --> 08:08.875
And what's this
strong enough for a man

08:08.942 --> 08:11.211
but made for a woman crap?

08:11.277 --> 08:15.481
Why don't they just say strong
enough for a big smelly woman?

08:17.751 --> 08:19.953
She needs some deodorant
for this act.

08:23.924 --> 08:26.026
Either she goes or I go.

08:26.092 --> 08:28.061
Alright, what do you say
we take a vote?

08:30.531 --> 08:32.899
Uh, alright, that's it.

08:32.966 --> 08:35.068
You'll never see me
in this place again.

08:35.135 --> 08:37.003
I'm getting
all my food delivered.

08:39.706 --> 08:42.075
(man on TV)
'In my 30 years of covering
the street signs'

08:42.142 --> 08:44.244
'this is the dullest fight
I've ever seen.'

08:46.647 --> 08:47.714
You know, thank God,
the food is real good

08:47.781 --> 08:49.516
but this slap fight
isn't worth my 20 bucks.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.552
Twenty bucks?

08:51.618 --> 08:53.119
What, they charge you more?

08:53.186 --> 08:55.589
They're not
charging me anything.

08:55.656 --> 08:56.957
Uh, Jeffrey, Jeffrey.

08:59.926 --> 09:01.401
Look, um, have you
given any more thought

09:01.467 --> 09:03.136
to who's gonna handle
the Hallowell account?

09:03.203 --> 09:04.971
Well, as a matter of fact,
I've made a decision.

09:05.038 --> 09:06.673
‐ Ohh, uh..
‐ What?

09:07.908 --> 09:10.577
Pork grinds.
Uh, little boy's room, where?

09:10.644 --> 09:11.978
‐ End of the hall.
‐ Oh.

09:13.647 --> 09:15.982
God speed.

09:16.049 --> 09:18.284
All I wanna know is how come
I paid and the suit didn't?

09:18.351 --> 09:20.787
Oh, everybody paid up and went
through you, right, Kyle?

09:23.557 --> 09:25.526
In their own way, yes.

09:26.426 --> 09:27.460
Oh, look, Bob Feller.

09:29.563 --> 09:31.732
[club music]

09:40.941 --> 09:43.209
Oh, great, Regine.

09:43.276 --> 09:44.545
Now if we wanna talk
to each other

09:44.611 --> 09:46.446
all we need to do
is use a bullhorn.

09:46.513 --> 09:50.216
Hey, Club Nexus is the perfect
spot for girls' night out.

09:50.283 --> 09:54.988
Yeah, great music and absolutely
no men hitting on us.

09:55.055 --> 09:57.758
And why aren't they
hitting on us? I look good.

09:58.992 --> 10:01.535
Oh, oh, oh, wait now.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.741
[cheering]

10:07.808 --> 10:11.044
Finally, an oasis
in this city full of bros.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.913
That voice.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.215
‐ Russell.
‐ Sugar chest.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.184
Boss lady.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.186
Russell, if you're gay

10:20.253 --> 10:22.222
you've been doing a hell
of a job hiding it.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.626
Now that's for damn sure.

10:25.692 --> 10:28.128
Shh. Step into my office.

10:31.798 --> 10:35.068
I'm not gay, but these folks
are great tippers.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.903
Especially when I flash
my winning smile.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.273
Hello, Benny.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.945
Plus, I have access
to straight women

10:45.011 --> 10:48.148
who don't expect a hetero Adonis
in their midst.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.884
‐ That works?
‐ The proof is in the pudding.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.620
Isn't that right, pudding cups?

10:54.921 --> 10:56.823
Frankie, cover for me.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.759
I'll get you
Bette Midler tickets.

11:01.267 --> 11:04.971
Let's dance and Lord help you if
your not wearing a sports bra.

11:06.873 --> 11:09.810
Russell, as classy
as that request was

11:09.876 --> 11:12.378
I, I would rather bathe
with a toaster.

11:13.479 --> 11:15.882
Okay. Attention, please.

11:15.949 --> 11:18.218
Russell is dancing.

11:18.284 --> 11:21.221
[upbeat music]

11:29.495 --> 11:30.864
Pardon me

11:30.931 --> 11:33.834
but has anyone ever told you
that you are stunning.

11:36.102 --> 11:38.171
‐ Not in this place.
‐ Hmm.

11:38.238 --> 11:41.241
You know, you've done an amazing
job of hiding that stubble.

11:41.307 --> 11:43.810
And your Adam's apple
is practically invisible.

11:45.378 --> 11:46.980
Well, why in the hell
would I have a stubble? What..

11:47.047 --> 11:48.348
Oh, oh, oh,
so you're really into

11:48.414 --> 11:50.651
the role playing thing,
huh? Okay.

11:50.717 --> 11:54.487
Listen, pal,
I am a natural born woman.

11:54.555 --> 11:56.422
Never had a jockstrap.

11:58.091 --> 12:00.527
Never got a prostate exam.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.203
In fact I'm ovulating
as we speak.

12:04.671 --> 12:06.239
A woman?

12:06.306 --> 12:08.474
Thanks for wasting
my time, sicko.

12:15.048 --> 12:18.051
Can you believe the ego?

12:20.386 --> 12:22.088
I mean, just hogging
the spotlight

12:22.155 --> 12:25.258
while a room full of people
watch in admiration.

12:26.993 --> 12:28.562
I'm going out there.

12:30.897 --> 12:32.799
[crowd cheering]

12:34.568 --> 12:36.537
Kyle, look here, man.

12:36.603 --> 12:37.871
I did a little digging

12:37.938 --> 12:40.440
and I realized
none of your guest paid.

12:40.507 --> 12:41.875
If you don't come up
with 60 bucks

12:41.942 --> 12:43.910
Red Rash is gonna rub up on you.

12:45.478 --> 12:48.348
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
my boss grubs gratis, alright?

12:48.414 --> 12:50.350
Look, all I know
is your boy Jeffrey

12:50.416 --> 12:52.285
makes about 12 grand a week

12:52.352 --> 12:55.321
while The Eclipse hasn't worked
steady since July '81.

12:57.123 --> 13:00.426
Look, need I remind you
that I just spent $400

13:00.493 --> 13:02.135
on sushi, wine,
big screen rental

13:02.202 --> 13:03.770
while you spent 32.50

13:03.837 --> 13:06.372
on generic sodas
and discount ice, huh?

13:07.841 --> 13:09.242
Jeffrey, Jeffrey,
how's your stomach?

13:09.309 --> 13:11.845
It's better, but I banged my
head on the edge of the toilet.

13:11.912 --> 13:14.380
‐ Where's an ice pack?
‐ Um, in the freezer.

13:14.447 --> 13:16.149
There's a Ralph Lauren ice pack.

13:16.216 --> 13:18.218
Why don't you finish off
that steak in there, too

13:18.284 --> 13:20.420
while you're at it?
It's all yours and all free.

13:22.255 --> 13:25.091
Well, at least my guests did
not descend on this apartment

13:25.158 --> 13:27.293
like a pack of marauding Hun.

13:32.198 --> 13:34.167
I didn't understand that,
but I didn't like it.

13:36.469 --> 13:40.073
Well, basically, he calling you
a ravenous buffoon.

13:41.708 --> 13:43.644
I'm still in the dark,
but I'm getting mad.

13:45.078 --> 13:47.147

the plunger squad

13:47.213 --> 13:49.850
from Paydes to understand.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.518
Now that I get.

13:51.585 --> 13:53.486
I'm ready to crack open a can
and whoop ass.

13:55.822 --> 13:57.724
No. Look here, man,
you're my guest.

13:57.791 --> 13:59.225
Allow me.

13:59.292 --> 14:02.268
You know what, dawg, about time
for the hammer to meet the nail.

14:03.837 --> 14:06.472
You feel a squirrely Kojak jump.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.642
Oh. To the hallway, bruh?

14:08.709 --> 14:11.011
‐ Let's go.
‐ Finally, let's see a fight.

14:12.846 --> 14:14.447
Yeah, about time.

14:18.785 --> 14:20.153
Come on,
you just bought that time.

14:20.220 --> 14:21.622
You can't talk
about my people like that.

14:21.688 --> 14:22.623
‐ Come on.
‐ Yeah.

14:22.689 --> 14:24.424
‐ Alright.
‐ Oh, what? Who?

14:24.490 --> 14:25.425
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:25.491 --> 14:27.227
I‐I‐I can't do this, man.

14:27.293 --> 14:29.996
Damn! I hate it
when cooler heads prevail.

14:30.063 --> 14:32.065
‐ Hit him, man.
‐ No, no, no, no, see.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.067
I just can't thaw down
in my suede shirt.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.335
Yeah!

14:35.401 --> 14:37.938
‐ Come on out this way.
‐ Alright.

[indistinct chatter]

14:46.079 --> 14:48.949

this, this is wrong, man.

14:49.015 --> 14:49.950
[sighs]

14:50.016 --> 14:51.585
I just replaced
these floorboards.

14:51.652 --> 14:53.186
And I ain't messing them up
with your blood.

14:53.253 --> 14:55.589
‐ To the street.
‐ To the street!

14:55.656 --> 14:57.858
Hey, fellas, fellas,
you're missing it.

14:57.924 --> 15:00.867
They came out throwing
haymakers in Hudson Jet

15:00.934 --> 15:02.703
and they knocked each other down

15:02.769 --> 15:04.638
and now they're both
trying to get up.

15:04.705 --> 15:06.640
And there's a bell!

15:13.947 --> 15:16.517
Oh, man, that's some real pain.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.821
Kyle, uh,
prize fighting history's

15:20.887 --> 15:22.989
been made upstairs, man.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.391
So what? You gonna back down
like you did in third grade?

15:25.458 --> 15:26.927
Huh, huh?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.333
Nobody backed down.

15:33.399 --> 15:34.935
As I recall,
you had a bloody nose

15:35.001 --> 15:36.670
and I had a lump in my head.

15:36.737 --> 15:37.871
Yeah, man, that bloody nose.

15:37.938 --> 15:41.141
It messed up
a perfectly good tie too.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.844
Yeah, my mom had to let out
my [indistinct] hat

15:43.910 --> 15:45.579
to make room for the lump.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.382
After we were put on punishment
for the whole summer

15:49.449 --> 15:51.552
I thought we swore
we'd never fight again.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.920
[chuckles]
Yeah, but we broke that promise
in the tenth grade

15:53.987 --> 15:56.489
when the same healthy senior
asked us both to the prom.

15:56.557 --> 15:57.991
‐ Yeah.
‐ Hmm.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.526
‐ Vanessa Edmonds.
‐ Vanessa Edmonds.

15:59.593 --> 16:00.734

named after their inventors.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.212
I don't know, the lazy Susan.

16:12.278 --> 16:14.748
I'd go with Philip screwdriver.

16:16.482 --> 16:19.385
Hey, you're right!
Thank you.

16:19.452 --> 16:22.956
My ex‐boyfriend Nolan
is a handyman.

16:23.023 --> 16:26.059
Really? So is my fiance.

16:26.126 --> 16:28.461
Nolan taught me all about tools.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.496
And then he left me
with nothing but memories

16:30.564 --> 16:32.165
and an empty cocking gun.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.502
Damn. Damn!

16:37.103 --> 16:38.939
Let me tell you something,
brother.

16:39.005 --> 16:40.541
You take that empty cocking gun

16:40.607 --> 16:42.909
and you use it to seal up
that broken heart.

16:42.976 --> 16:46.680
We cannot have the,
the moisture of depression

16:46.747 --> 16:49.082

in your bathtub of hope.

‐ You're right.
‐ I know I am.

Girlfriend, you make me
feel like dancing.

16:57.357 --> 16:59.292
Let's dance the night away.

[siren wailing]

17:02.803 --> 17:04.971
Hey, Cayman Island.

17:05.038 --> 17:07.107
Khadijah broke
the Super Slang records.

17:07.173 --> 17:10.042
Oh, shoot, I just won 23 beers

17:10.109 --> 17:12.278
and unlimited pretzels.

17:12.345 --> 17:14.615
‐ Get at me. Get at me.
‐ Congratulations, Khadijah.

17:14.681 --> 17:17.150
Hanks had the records
since the 4th of July.

17:17.217 --> 17:19.019
I remember
because he was wearing

17:19.085 --> 17:21.788
star spangled hot pants.

17:21.855 --> 17:24.057
Kid Hank.
This is my thing now.

17:24.124 --> 17:26.792
‐ Oh, well, if it isn't Hank.
‐ Khadijah.

Well, you better have
a whole purse full of quarters

if you plan on beatin' me.

17:51.885 --> 17:54.988

he'll beat your record.

Not if he sees that run
in his stocking.

18:01.467 --> 18:03.403
That was not fair.

a good time tonight?

See.

18:28.729 --> 18:29.996
See, I was about to say

18:30.063 --> 18:31.898
I didn't have the worst time
in the world.

18:31.965 --> 18:34.134
Now what did you do?
What did you do?

18:34.200 --> 18:36.169
You ruined it.

18:36.236 --> 18:38.605
Not the worst time in the world.

18:38.672 --> 18:41.742
Where I come from, that's as
good as saying I love you.

18:43.243 --> 18:45.278
Well, we're not in Jamaica.

18:45.345 --> 18:48.214
I'm talking about the Bronx.

‐ Alright, Russ.
‐ Bye, Russell.

18:55.822 --> 18:58.592
So, uh, Jeff, is it,
um, safe to assume

18:58.659 --> 19:00.160
you had a good time tonight?

19:00.226 --> 19:03.236
Well, actually, it reminded me
of my days as a young man..

19:04.638 --> 19:05.806
...in Vietnam.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.341
So it's safe to assume

19:08.408 --> 19:10.076
that you're signing
the Hallowell account

19:10.143 --> 19:13.113
to someone who didn't give you
flashbacks of Jungle warfare.

19:13.179 --> 19:15.816
Kyle, I had a great time.

19:15.882 --> 19:19.085
I ate my favorite foods,
I saw a wonderful fight

19:19.152 --> 19:20.987
and Mr. Eclipse and I are going

19:21.054 --> 19:22.989

next week.

19:24.257 --> 19:26.727
Son, you have the account.

19:26.793 --> 19:27.961
‐ Yes.
‐ Alright.

19:28.028 --> 19:29.930
It was so nice
to meet you, Mr. Overbite.

19:29.996 --> 19:31.364
Okay.

19:33.767 --> 19:35.435
See you, Jeff.

19:35.502 --> 19:39.372
Well, as my Uncle Tibby
used to say

19:39.439 --> 19:42.876
"Just when you think
the tornado's gonna hit you

19:42.943 --> 19:45.546
it turns and hit your neighbors
trailer instead."

If that's your way of saying
all's well that ends well

19:52.553 --> 19:54.755
then I conquer, my brother.

And now is time
for my favorite nightcap.

they were fierce.

‐ 'Yeah.'
‐ 'Yeah, sure.'

a heated debate.

Yeah, you know,

how to get rid of men‐‐

tonight, y'all.

to let anything come between us.

not children, not careers.

Yeah, it's easy
for you to say, Regine.

21:06.272 --> 21:08.008
Oh, I‐I'm sorry.
I forgot we are bonding.

important to me.

of the free cable.

Why don't we do this again
next Saturday?

Oh, I can't.

‐ Saturday after that?
‐ Booked.

Oh, I'm busy
the weekend after that.

to enjoy the night

happen again.
