WEBVTT

00:03.973 --> 00:05.971
WOMAN CRIES OUT IN PAIN

00:09.010 --> 00:11.973
UNDER HER BREATH:
Ah agle mou, Spirithona.

00:12.008 --> 00:14.931
- Oh, parcel.
- Ah.

00:14.966 --> 00:17.964
Riches from my tailor, Mr Jakeways.

00:21.962 --> 00:24.765
I saw Daphne with her baby,
for the first time.

00:24.800 --> 00:25.924
Oh, darling.

00:25.959 --> 00:30.921
I want my own family.
I'm 20, that's a good age to start.

00:30.956 --> 00:33.919
It isn't really. You can't even vote,

00:33.954 --> 00:35.918
and you've got... well, how much money?

00:35.953 --> 00:39.916
- In financial terms?
- No, in bananas.

00:39.951 --> 00:41.950
Well, as a man in my prime, I'm ready.

00:42.949 --> 00:44.913
Bulls start at the age of one.

00:44.948 --> 00:46.912
Well, you're not a bull,
you help run a guesthouse.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.910
And I need you here, while Larry's gone.

00:48.945 --> 00:51.909
And Margo say she will leave soon.

00:51.944 --> 00:53.907
What? Well, that's absurd.

00:53.942 --> 00:57.905
That's like releasing a dotty kitten
into the jungle.

00:57.940 --> 01:00.903
And that's why she wants to go,
because you think she's a clot.

01:00.938 --> 01:02.902
I don't think she's a clot!

01:02.937 --> 01:07.899
She's just not ready for the real
world of normal human interaction.

01:07.934 --> 01:09.933
Oh! Ah!

01:11.931 --> 01:14.895
- Lugaretzia, please, go home.
- I go home.

01:14.930 --> 01:18.927
Go home and rest your bad back
or your bottom or whatever it is.

01:20.926 --> 01:24.889
- What do you think?
- Does Mr Toad know you have his clothes?

01:24.924 --> 01:28.726
Louisa, I love your cruelty.

01:28.761 --> 01:30.885
Well, that's good, there's plenty
more where that came from.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.884
CAR APPROACHES

01:32.919 --> 01:34.918
- CAR HORN
- Oh.

01:35.917 --> 01:38.081
- Martin crapped on me.
- Oh. - My fault.

01:38.116 --> 01:40.914
PIG SQUEALS

01:46.910 --> 01:48.909
You must be Mrs Durrells.

01:50.948 --> 01:55.870
- You come highly recommended.
- Ah, well, how nice.

01:55.905 --> 01:58.868
- Durrell, in fact.
- Do you have a room for me?

01:58.903 --> 02:01.901
I do. The penthouse on the top floor.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.863
What is this, a ruddy zoo?

02:06.898 --> 02:08.862
Yes, I suppose it is.

02:08.896 --> 02:11.935
Don't get romantic with him.
He's not your type.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:02.225 --> 03:05.828
The Colonel loves guns,
so you two will get on well, Leslie.

03:05.863 --> 03:08.061
In fact, I've moved on from shooting.

03:11.859 --> 03:12.823
Although that is quite something.

03:12.858 --> 03:16.536
Margo's gone. Sorry about the poo.

03:20.853 --> 03:23.817
'Dear Mother, I know you'd try
to make me stay,

03:23.852 --> 03:25.815
'so I've been smuggling
out my possessions.

03:25.850 --> 03:28.814
'I'll be at a secret location in Corfu.

03:28.849 --> 03:30.812
'I'll be in touch when settled.'

03:30.847 --> 03:32.846
- Where's Margo gone?
- She won't say.

03:33.846 --> 03:36.809
Well, this is terrible.
We must search the island.

03:36.844 --> 03:40.806
No! We all run off when we're nippers.

03:40.841 --> 03:42.805
- How old is she?
- 18.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.803
- Well, it's time she left then.
- Yes, it'll be all right.

03:45.838 --> 03:48.322
- Do her good.
- Your job's done.

03:48.357 --> 03:53.639
What do all you men know?
I'm... sad as a mother,

03:53.674 --> 03:55.872
as a woman,
frankly, I'm feeling outnumbered.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.471
Then I went over the top in Wipers...

04:06.506 --> 04:07.790
- and...
- LAUGHS

04:07.825 --> 04:10.024
- ..copped a Blighty.
- What?

04:11.503 --> 04:13.786
He fought at Ypres
and was invalided home.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.785
Still got a crotch full of shrapnel.

04:16.820 --> 04:19.783
I can't have magnets in the house.

04:19.817 --> 04:21.781
Louisa doesn't want to hear
the word "crotch".

04:21.817 --> 04:24.780
No, it's fine,
I am familiar with the concept.

04:24.815 --> 04:27.778
Well, don't let me harp on
about the war.

04:27.813 --> 04:28.777
Or should I?

04:28.812 --> 04:29.777
No.

04:29.812 --> 04:32.775
The time I got a bayonet up
my jacksie in the Bosphorus, anyone?

04:32.810 --> 04:36.773
- I thought you liked war.
- Nobody sane likes war.

04:36.808 --> 04:39.451
I believe in protecting
one's loved ones,

04:39.486 --> 04:41.770
if one's lucky enough to have any.

04:41.805 --> 04:44.768
Well, the Hun are up to
their old tricks.

04:44.803 --> 04:46.767
Clearly, I didn't kill enough last time.

04:46.802 --> 04:49.445
Austria's gone, who's next?

04:49.480 --> 04:51.764
I've decided there won't be a new war.

04:51.798 --> 04:53.762
Good girl.

04:53.797 --> 04:55.761
Little bit over familiar.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.760
I've been here for months,
I've earned it.

04:57.795 --> 05:00.758
We have a super rapport.

05:00.793 --> 05:03.956
Anyway, I've recently left the army

05:03.991 --> 05:07.754
and I'd rather like
to try my hand at hunting.

05:07.789 --> 05:10.752
- Oh no, don't do that.
- Why not?

05:10.787 --> 05:13.750
Only an idiot
would kill an animal for fun.

05:13.785 --> 05:15.749
And I'm sure you're not an idiot.

05:15.784 --> 05:17.783
Gerry, don't be rude
to our paying guests.

05:22.780 --> 05:26.977
Your family, is it me,
or is it slightly falling apart?

05:44.766 --> 05:47.410
I love it here, Theo,
thanks for letting me stay.

05:47.445 --> 05:48.764
No, it's good for me.

05:50.763 --> 05:53.726
I'm a creature of routine,
which is terrible.

05:53.761 --> 05:56.085
Me and my perfectly symmetrical room.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.724
Break it up!

05:57.759 --> 06:00.722
But let me tell your mother you're here.

06:00.757 --> 06:02.721
- She's anxious.
- No, don't you dare.

06:02.756 --> 06:06.918
Oh, I bought these
yesterday in the market.

06:06.953 --> 06:09.716
They'll help me inspire
my new beauty business.

06:09.751 --> 06:11.750
Let's take this old codger down.

06:15.748 --> 06:17.427
Isn't it gorgeous?

06:18.746 --> 06:20.910
You don't mind, do you?

06:20.945 --> 06:22.743
Thanks, Theo.

06:37.734 --> 06:39.733
FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

06:41.732 --> 06:45.695
I hear you're a gun wallah.
Let's go hunting.

06:45.730 --> 06:47.533
No, I've left that behind me.

06:47.568 --> 06:49.692
I want a solid career
so I can have a family and...

06:49.727 --> 06:51.691
I'll pay you handsomely.

06:51.726 --> 06:55.729
Now, what's the big game on Corfu?

06:55.763 --> 06:58.687
Well, the biggest prize is wild
boar, but they're hard to find.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.686
Good! You sort that out then.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.719
And I'll have my money back
if it's a washout.

07:15.711 --> 07:17.675
KNOCK

07:17.710 --> 07:20.229
- Yeah.
- DOOR OPENS

07:21.548 --> 07:22.672
Evening.

07:22.707 --> 07:25.670
Did you know that insects don't
have circulatory blood systems?

07:25.705 --> 07:27.189
Right.

07:27.224 --> 07:30.188
Their organs bathe in chambers of blood,

07:30.223 --> 07:32.666
it's usually green or yellow.

07:32.701 --> 07:35.699
I... need to confide in someone.

07:37.698 --> 07:39.697
- Leslie's downstairs.
- No, he'd be useless.

07:41.696 --> 07:43.694
- The Colonel's...
- I'd rather die.

07:44.694 --> 07:47.657
- Mother's somewhere.
- It's her I want to talk about.

07:47.692 --> 07:49.656
Because I'm... finding,

07:49.691 --> 07:52.689
to my surprise, that I...

07:54.048 --> 07:55.687
..well...

07:56.687 --> 07:57.686
I love her.

08:01.684 --> 08:03.687
- I love her, too.
- Not the way I love her.

08:03.722 --> 08:05.681
Like a burning...

08:06.681 --> 08:08.679
..house.

08:10.678 --> 08:12.642
When locusts fail to find a mate

08:12.677 --> 08:14.641
they travel,
often for thousands of miles...

08:14.676 --> 08:17.639
Can we, for once, not relate
everything to creepy crawlies?

08:17.674 --> 08:20.672
Based on your knowledge of your mum...

08:22.671 --> 08:26.668
..d'you have any hints or tips
re unlocking her heart?

08:30.666 --> 08:34.664
- You haven't a hope in hell. Sorry.
- Well...

08:38.660 --> 08:40.659
There's a challenge.

08:43.658 --> 08:45.622
'Dear Ma and the sibling horde,

08:45.657 --> 08:47.621
'I'm perched up here in the North

08:47.656 --> 08:50.139
'which cascades serenity

08:50.174 --> 08:52.618
'when I'm not hammering
sentences into being.'

08:52.653 --> 08:56.650
Oh, Larry. Please relax, it's me.

08:57.650 --> 09:00.613
- 'How are the kids?'
- That's better.

09:00.648 --> 09:03.611
'I miss them, and you, of course.

09:03.646 --> 09:07.609
'My dancer girls have left to prance
professionally in Athens,

09:07.644 --> 09:10.642
'but I am writing
like a hungry fish. Are you happy?

09:11.641 --> 09:15.604
'Knowing you, and I do,
you will concede only,

09:15.639 --> 09:19.477
'"Partly happy with risk of
scattered doubts, heavy at times."'

09:22.675 --> 09:25.598
Larry's letters make me sad too.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.597
But that's because they're gibberish.

09:27.632 --> 09:32.114
I miss him. And Margo, of course,
as one misses a....

09:32.149 --> 09:34.273
..dotty kitten who's run off
into the jungle

09:34.308 --> 09:37.626
- even though she's not ready for the real world or...
- All right.

09:38.625 --> 09:42.428
But over the years, I've grown
used to confiding in Larry.

09:42.463 --> 09:46.585
And Spiros, although he and I
are rebuilding our friendship

09:46.620 --> 09:48.619
- since, well, you know...
- Yes.

09:51.617 --> 09:55.580
Well, I'm mature, and financially secure

09:55.615 --> 09:57.578
now I'm running the Colonel's hunts.

09:57.613 --> 09:59.577
You don't need Larry or Spiros.

09:59.612 --> 10:03.255
I'm your confidant now.
Guiding your every move.

10:03.290 --> 10:05.609
Your worries are at an end.

10:18.601 --> 10:19.600
Sorry.

10:37.629 --> 10:41.552
- Spiros, have you seen Margo anywhere?
- No.

10:41.587 --> 10:44.585
You worry too much.
You should stop that.

10:45.584 --> 10:47.548
Spiros, things don't seem
to be getting back

10:47.583 --> 10:50.546
- to how they were between us.
- No, you're tense.

10:50.581 --> 10:53.545
Well, yes, I am, because I, I...

10:53.580 --> 10:58.542
You are alone in the house
with lots of men. It's not healthy.

10:58.577 --> 11:01.540
I will have as many men in the house
as I need to pay the bills.

11:01.575 --> 11:05.537
Lying around in hammocks
in their underwear if they wish.

11:05.572 --> 11:09.535
I'm just saying, make it clear
you're not interested in them.

11:09.570 --> 11:12.568
I'm not interested in them!

11:13.568 --> 11:17.210
Drop in any time and see for yourself.

11:17.245 --> 11:19.404
I may do that.

11:31.077 --> 11:35.359
My husband is away a lot,
and not reliable,

11:35.394 --> 11:37.553
but we are trying
to make a good marriage.

11:38.552 --> 11:40.551
I'm going to love having a baby.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.909
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No, I'm waiting for you.

11:46.548 --> 11:49.511
That's not fair. For you or anyone.

11:49.546 --> 11:51.545
Maybe, who knows.

11:53.543 --> 11:55.542
She likes you.

11:56.542 --> 11:59.505
But you can leave her
and go home and sleep.

11:59.540 --> 12:01.504
I'll babysit if you want a rest.

12:01.539 --> 12:05.501
You would? My father says men
do not look after babies.

12:05.536 --> 12:08.499
Well, I'm the new kind of man.
Who's sensitive to women,

12:08.534 --> 12:10.498
whilst remaining manly in the extreme.

12:10.533 --> 12:12.497
Leslie Durrell.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.495
- Oh, Mr Likourgos.
- What are you doing these days?

12:15.530 --> 12:18.493
I have an exciting new venture,
organising hunting trips.

12:18.528 --> 12:20.492
Where is the best place
to hunt wild boar?

12:20.527 --> 12:24.490
The woods at Evropouli.
I own the hunting licence.

12:24.525 --> 12:28.487
- You can shoot wild boar there.
- Oh, thank you.

12:28.522 --> 12:29.522
For you, not expensive.

12:33.519 --> 12:36.038
Fine. How much?

12:51.029 --> 12:53.472
- Might I...
- SCREAMS

12:53.507 --> 12:55.151
Apologies.

12:55.186 --> 12:57.505
Erm... Might I help?

12:59.503 --> 13:01.502
Yes, you can wash up.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.499
- There you are.
- Oh!

13:07.499 --> 13:10.462
My tailor, Mr Jakeways, would faint

13:10.497 --> 13:12.496
if he saw me mixing textures like this.

13:14.854 --> 13:17.458
I've never actually done this before.

13:17.493 --> 13:19.456
Oh, it's great fun.

13:19.491 --> 13:21.455
If you're very good,
you can build a new lavatory pit.

13:21.490 --> 13:23.489
Ha-ha.

13:26.487 --> 13:27.487
Are you all right?

13:31.484 --> 13:35.806
Do you think my family is falling
apart, as the Colonel said?

13:35.841 --> 13:40.644
No! I mean I know...
one's left and one's missing

13:40.679 --> 13:43.442
and the other two hate each other,
but, er...

13:43.477 --> 13:46.475
So, Louisa...

13:47.474 --> 13:50.438
- Mm.
- What are your...

13:50.473 --> 13:52.471
Oh, look, I've made it clean.

13:57.468 --> 14:00.432
- What are your favourite things?
- Why do you ask?

14:00.467 --> 14:02.465
No reason. Come on!

14:04.464 --> 14:07.502
Erm... Dancing.

14:09.461 --> 14:12.784
Er, bridge, seafood... ooh!

14:12.819 --> 14:15.423
Dandie Dinmont dogs,

14:15.457 --> 14:17.421
- my children being happy...
- That's enough.

14:17.456 --> 14:20.454
Shh.

14:32.447 --> 14:34.446
My copepods!

14:41.442 --> 14:45.444
Honestly, Theo, why are people
so selfish and insensitive?

14:45.479 --> 14:48.403
It's not deliberate.
We are just different.

14:48.438 --> 14:51.401
- You don't know what I'm talking about.
- Oh, I see.

14:51.436 --> 14:54.434
Our new guest, Colonel Ribbidane, has...

14:56.113 --> 14:58.631
- Have you got guests?
- No, no.

15:00.430 --> 15:03.393
So this preposterous Colonel arrives
with his war chest,

15:03.428 --> 15:06.072
and he and Leslie are planning
to slaughter wild boar.

15:06.107 --> 15:09.070
Well, tell Leslie how strongly you feel.

15:09.105 --> 15:12.388
He's so much more thoughtful these days.

15:12.423 --> 15:14.387
What's this?

15:14.422 --> 15:19.419
I'm.... experimenting
with more colour in my wardrobe.

15:20.618 --> 15:23.416
You've got a woman, haven't you?

15:25.415 --> 15:29.378
Yes, I have. But don't tell anyone.

15:29.413 --> 15:31.931
Honestly, Theo, it's about time,
we were all wondering.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.374
Who is it? Is she young?

15:35.409 --> 15:37.408
Is she a scientist, but a sexy one?

15:45.403 --> 15:47.402
It's Margo.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.363
Yes, it's Margo.
She's only staying here.

15:53.398 --> 15:55.402
- Well, I know that.
- But don't tell your mother.

15:55.437 --> 15:58.395
Margo is desperate
to discover more about herself.

15:59.594 --> 16:02.393
I miss her, but she's not easy
to live with, is she?

16:16.744 --> 16:19.547
Colonel, I've secured
the perfect private woodland

16:19.582 --> 16:22.381
- for hunting wild boar.
- Good man.

16:24.380 --> 16:25.379
Sit.

16:27.378 --> 16:33.054
Now, when I'm shooting with a man
I like to know what makes him tick.

16:34.373 --> 16:35.538
Answer?

16:35.573 --> 16:38.696
Well, I, er, like to think
I'm a decent sort.

16:38.731 --> 16:42.334
I hold this place together...
with my mother.

16:42.369 --> 16:47.331
What's this I hear about you pining
for some girl and a baby?

16:47.366 --> 16:49.329
- Well, yes...
- I've nothing against the dainty sex.

16:49.364 --> 16:51.328
I've been married at least once
and they did their best,

16:51.363 --> 16:55.326
but if we're going hunting together,
let's keep it...

16:55.361 --> 16:57.325
red blooded.

16:57.360 --> 17:01.357
Don't worry, when the time comes,
I'll be cocked and ready to go.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.355
A word, please.

17:06.354 --> 17:07.354
Excuse me.

17:12.349 --> 17:15.314
- Please don't go hunting.
- Oh, don't be so sentimental.

17:15.348 --> 17:18.311
Compared to how animals kill
each other, shooting them is humane.

17:18.347 --> 17:22.309
Cornering animals and executing them
is not humane.

17:22.344 --> 17:24.183
It's a wood, there are no corners.

17:25.343 --> 17:27.701
Gerry, this is work.
The Colonel's paying me.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.304
All right, I'll save up

17:31.339 --> 17:33.303
and I'll match what he's paying you.
How much is it?

17:33.338 --> 17:36.336
£25. For one week.

17:41.333 --> 17:45.136
I'm going to put a wave in your hair
like Jean Harlow.

17:45.171 --> 17:46.295
Why?

17:46.330 --> 17:49.133
We owe it to the world
to be as beautiful as possible.

17:49.168 --> 17:51.292
In case you're worried
I'm just a silly girl,

17:51.327 --> 17:53.291
I worked at Theo's x-ray unit
for two years.

17:53.326 --> 17:55.809
So I know what I'm doing.

17:55.844 --> 17:59.322
The curling tongs need to be nice
and warm to put a wave in your hair.

18:00.361 --> 18:02.680
DOOR OPENS

18:06.318 --> 18:07.997
Sorry I'm late.

18:09.316 --> 18:13.279
Mr Stephanides is my salon assistant
for the day.

18:13.314 --> 18:16.277
One can't have enough strings
to one's bow, can one?

18:16.312 --> 18:19.275
WHISPERING

18:19.310 --> 18:21.274
Is there a difficulty?

18:21.309 --> 18:23.273
We were wondering whether your hair
is so lovely

18:23.308 --> 18:25.306
we should leave it as it is.

18:34.301 --> 18:35.300
Oh!

18:37.299 --> 18:40.622
Or treat this visit
as an initial consultation

18:40.657 --> 18:44.295
- and do some research and reconvene.
- What a good idea.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.256
Herete, Galini.

18:50.291 --> 18:52.290
- Gerry, pos eisai?
- Kala, efharisto.

18:55.288 --> 18:57.252
- Something bad is happening.
- Really?

18:57.287 --> 19:00.250
And there comes a time when we need
to stand up for what we believe in.

19:00.285 --> 19:01.250
Yes.

19:01.285 --> 19:03.248
What do we believe in?

19:03.283 --> 19:05.247
There's a mad Colonel staying with us

19:05.282 --> 19:08.245
and he's paying Leslie
to take him to kill wild boar.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.764
- That's terrible.
- Exactly.

19:09.799 --> 19:12.243
- So we're going to stop them.
- Good.

19:12.278 --> 19:14.242
Well, I am.

19:14.277 --> 19:16.241
You probably better stay back
and watch me take the bullet.

19:16.276 --> 19:19.274
No, we die together.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.232
Leslie!

19:30.267 --> 19:33.230
Household items and provisions
for your hunting expedition.

19:33.265 --> 19:35.229
Ah, thank you, Spiros.

19:35.264 --> 19:38.227
I hear you plan to hunt in the woods
with Mr Likourgos.

19:38.262 --> 19:40.226
Yes, it's good for wild boar.

19:40.261 --> 19:43.224
- Well, in fact, it isn't.
- What?

19:43.259 --> 19:46.222
Mr Likourgos is pulling a fast one.

19:46.257 --> 19:49.221
- Where does that saying come from?
- Er, I don't know.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.220
What do you mean?

19:50.255 --> 19:53.218
There are no wild boars
in that forest...

19:53.253 --> 19:56.576
or anywhere for miles.
And he doesn't own the licence,

19:56.611 --> 19:59.250
- it's common land.
- Argh!

20:07.245 --> 20:10.243
- Mrs Durrells.
- Mr Hakiaopulos.

20:11.242 --> 20:13.566
Keen to check I'm not flirting
with all my menfolk?

20:13.601 --> 20:15.725
Of course not.

20:15.760 --> 20:21.201
I saw your Basil in town,
buying a big gift, probably for you.

20:21.236 --> 20:23.200
Knowing Basil, it'll be for him.

20:23.235 --> 20:26.198
- Anyone seen my swimming hat?
- You need a hat to swim?

20:26.233 --> 20:28.592
Oh! You're looking good enough to scoff.

20:30.231 --> 20:31.555
He's never said anything
like that before.

20:31.590 --> 20:33.229
Uh-huh.

20:34.428 --> 20:36.192
I loved our chat yesterday.

20:36.227 --> 20:40.225
Thank you for opening up to me
so deliciously.

20:44.222 --> 20:47.420
Now you see why I wonder?
Have they tried to seduce you?

20:49.219 --> 20:51.183
No. And that's not fair,

20:51.218 --> 20:53.182
Spiros, after all we've been through.

20:53.217 --> 20:55.181
And it's me who should be jealous.

20:55.216 --> 20:57.214
You're the one with a full bed
to go home to.

21:18.042 --> 21:19.201
What's wrong?

21:20.201 --> 21:22.844
- Nothing.
- Don't "nothing" me.

21:22.879 --> 21:24.163
You confide in me, remember?

21:24.198 --> 21:27.196
I'm the new Larry,
but less pretentious. Come on.

21:31.194 --> 21:35.191
Spiros is jealous and what's
the point as we can't be together?

21:37.190 --> 21:40.153
Well, that's why he's jealous.

21:40.188 --> 21:43.152
Well, in my experience, throwing
oneself into hard, vigorous work

21:43.187 --> 21:46.150
- can help conquer heartache.
- What do you think I've been doing?

21:46.185 --> 21:49.148
I have the hands of an ancient farmer.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.147
Good, you've taken that advice.

21:51.182 --> 21:54.825
Now, what about winning Spiros over, hm?

21:54.860 --> 21:57.143
Spiros is a faithful husband,

21:57.178 --> 21:59.177
as is right and proper.

22:00.176 --> 22:02.015
And rare and regrettable.

22:03.175 --> 22:07.172
Would his wife perhaps step aside if
you were to make a good enough case?

22:08.172 --> 22:10.170
No, Leslie.

22:12.169 --> 22:15.132
No to that, fair enough.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.131
Well, if all three of you are unhappy

22:17.166 --> 22:20.164
- why not agree on some compromise?
- And how would that work?

22:21.164 --> 22:22.163
Hm...

22:23.162 --> 22:26.126
I'm glad you value compromise.

22:26.161 --> 22:29.124
Please call off the hunt tomorrow,
for Gerry's sake...

22:29.159 --> 22:32.122
No! I'm going to bloody do this

22:32.157 --> 22:34.156
and it's going to be a success.

22:51.146 --> 22:52.110
So I said to my mother,

22:52.145 --> 22:55.108
"you've never really taken me
seriously, have you?"

22:55.143 --> 22:57.107
That is hard for a mother to hear.

22:57.142 --> 23:01.105
In fact, I've always enjoyed
not being taken seriously,

23:01.139 --> 23:03.138
but as you get older,
it becomes a bit unseemly.

23:05.497 --> 23:07.136
Now don't shout at me.

23:19.968 --> 23:21.092
I look nice.

23:21.127 --> 23:23.771
You do.

23:23.806 --> 23:27.089
- So how long will this last?
- The wave?

23:27.124 --> 23:30.926
Not long. But next time
I can put in a permanent one.

23:30.961 --> 23:35.084
- How do you do that?
- Chemicals and a lot of bravery.

23:35.119 --> 23:37.118
If I get it wrong,
all your hair falls out.

23:39.117 --> 23:40.116
I trust you.

23:57.625 --> 23:59.104
Come here.

24:01.103 --> 24:04.066
- Sit! Sit!
- PIG SQUEALS

24:04.101 --> 24:06.100
Argh! Martin, come here.

24:10.098 --> 24:11.097
Come on, you'll look good in this.

24:12.296 --> 24:14.135
Here!

24:18.093 --> 24:21.091
PIG SQUEALS

24:26.088 --> 24:28.087
Oh, for God's sake.

24:49.074 --> 24:52.037
- Ah, morning, can I have a word?
- Just off to see Galini. - Stop!

24:52.072 --> 24:54.036
Two things.

24:54.071 --> 24:58.234
If you try to interfere
in the shooting, you may die,

24:58.269 --> 25:01.032
which would, on balance, be a waste.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.071
And?

25:02.106 --> 25:05.030
Do people know where Margo is
and they're not telling me

25:05.065 --> 25:06.424
out of some urge to protect her?

25:07.743 --> 25:10.027
Well, I've protected her all her life

25:10.061 --> 25:12.025
- and I am the best at it.
- Yes, you are.

25:12.060 --> 25:14.024
FOOTSTEPS

25:14.059 --> 25:16.063
- Thank you.
- Where are you off to?

25:16.098 --> 25:18.701
Hunting.

25:18.736 --> 25:20.060
Oh.

25:20.095 --> 25:23.254
- Are you in a pickle of some sort?
- Do you really want to know?

25:26.052 --> 25:28.016
No, no.

25:28.051 --> 25:31.014
So, we're after wild boar.

25:31.049 --> 25:35.011
I'm new to the hunting game,
unless you count Germans.

25:35.046 --> 25:39.044
- Let's not.
- And Turks.

25:41.043 --> 25:42.847
I'll get on then.

25:42.882 --> 25:44.880
Solid plan! Solid plan!

25:52.036 --> 25:54.999
- Hello, Leslie.
- Daphne. And Katina, how nice.

25:55.034 --> 25:57.997
- I have a favour to ask.
- Yeah, before you do...

25:58.032 --> 25:59.996
Your father's cheated me.

26:00.031 --> 26:01.995
I paid him to let us hunt wild boar

26:02.030 --> 26:03.994
and it seems there aren't any
and I didn't need to.

26:04.029 --> 26:07.991
- Otherwise, brilliant.
- I'm so sorry, I didn't know.

26:08.026 --> 26:10.990
- You said you may be able to babysit.
- I'd love to.

26:11.025 --> 26:13.988
- Thank you, I have so many things to do.
- Woah, woah, now?

26:14.023 --> 26:15.987
I'm about to leave on a wild boar hunt.

26:16.022 --> 26:18.345
- But you said there are no wild boar there.
- Shh!

26:18.380 --> 26:19.984
I have a plan to get round that,

26:20.019 --> 26:22.018
by creating the illusion
of a wild boar, see?

26:23.017 --> 26:23.982
Perhaps nobody is honest.

26:24.017 --> 26:26.980
Look, I'll help any other time,
but this hunt is so important to me.

26:27.015 --> 26:28.979
Larry's left
so I'm the man of the house now

26:29.014 --> 26:32.012
and for the first time I can, erm,
really, erm...

26:33.051 --> 26:35.975
All right, my mother can
look after you until I get back.

26:36.009 --> 26:37.973
Can't she, eh?

26:38.008 --> 26:39.652
- Everything you need is in there.
- OK.

26:39.687 --> 26:41.971
- I will come back tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

26:42.006 --> 26:45.684
Please. I need a break or I go mad.

26:48.002 --> 26:49.002
BABY CRIES

27:01.994 --> 27:03.993
Oh, hello.

27:06.511 --> 27:11.793
- Theo, I'm sorry...
- No, no, no, I am.

27:11.828 --> 27:14.311
But the truth is,
I'm so used to living on my own.

27:14.346 --> 27:16.950
Oh, no, you've hated having me here.

27:16.985 --> 27:19.468
No, you're a delight, you're my friend.

27:19.503 --> 27:22.981
But for me, a disorderly house
creates a disorderly mind.

27:23.980 --> 27:26.979
But I'm fine
now the furniture is symmetrical.

27:35.973 --> 27:38.457
I know now what I need to do.

27:38.492 --> 27:40.935
Please, tell your mother where you are.

27:40.970 --> 27:42.934
Not yet.

27:42.969 --> 27:44.968
I'm getting a taste for independence.

27:45.967 --> 27:48.930
You'd have been proud of me,
I waved Mrs Mavrokondas's hair

27:48.965 --> 27:51.804
- without killing her.
- I am proud of you.

27:56.161 --> 27:59.959
Basil, I need your help
with my hunting expedition.

28:00.958 --> 28:04.441
Oh, I knew there was something -
you mustn't go hunting,

28:04.476 --> 28:07.954
- your mother asked me to stop it.
- Tough, we're going. But...

28:09.953 --> 28:12.916
..would you go ahead,
hide in the foliage

28:12.951 --> 28:15.914
and make a noise
like a wild boar, please?

28:15.949 --> 28:17.953
I fear that could end in tears.

28:17.988 --> 28:20.911
No, no, it won't. It'll be a laugh!

28:20.946 --> 28:22.945
Day out in the woods, up a tree.

28:24.624 --> 28:26.942
- Why do you need wild boar noises?
- Shh!

28:28.941 --> 28:31.904
Because there are no wild boars,
it turns out,

28:31.939 --> 28:34.903
so the Colonel
will demand his money back.

28:34.938 --> 28:37.936
My sympathies. Still no.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.898
If you help me,
I'll show you how to impress Mother.

28:41.933 --> 28:45.896
I've already taken steps
to win her over.

28:45.931 --> 28:48.929
Well, I can more or less guarantee
success, because I'm her confidant.

28:51.607 --> 28:52.892
What noise do wild boar make?

28:52.927 --> 28:55.890
If I remember correctly,
it's something like...

28:55.925 --> 28:57.924
- IMITATES WILD BOAR SQUEAL
- But louder.

28:58.923 --> 29:01.247
IMITATES WILD BOAR SQUEAL

29:01.282 --> 29:04.884
Wow, yeah. Oh, that's a nasty cough.

29:04.919 --> 29:05.919
- It's a bit of a... a tickle.
- Tickle.

29:07.918 --> 29:11.880
Delivery for you.
What are we waiting for?

29:11.915 --> 29:15.433
- I just need my mother to come home before we leave.
- Why?

29:30.904 --> 29:34.866
- Welcome home!
- Thank you, no need to welcome me.

29:34.901 --> 29:36.865
I, er, have something to say.

29:36.900 --> 29:40.863
Over the months I've been here,
you may have observed my journey

29:40.898 --> 29:43.861
from somewhat prissy guest
to dogged admirer.

29:43.896 --> 29:46.859
You're going quite fast,
can I just gently slow you down

29:46.894 --> 29:48.858
and ask you to shut your eyes.

29:48.893 --> 29:52.056
Why? The last time I did that,
Gerry put a lizard down my blouse.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.534
Yes, I won't do that.

29:54.569 --> 29:58.567
Though it sounds like massive fun.
Erm, ready then?

30:03.884 --> 30:07.047
So, here... er, stop.

30:07.082 --> 30:10.845
Keep them shut.
As a symbol of our connection,

30:10.880 --> 30:14.877
is this gift which I now give you.

30:18.875 --> 30:20.074
And, open.

30:33.386 --> 30:36.829
Obviously, it lacks water, but I'll...

30:36.864 --> 30:38.863
divert a stream when I have a moment.

30:39.862 --> 30:41.506
- Basil, why have you...?
- Say nothing.

30:41.541 --> 30:43.860
Please excuse me, I'm needed in a wood.

30:44.859 --> 30:46.898
Enjoy your gift.

30:53.854 --> 30:55.817
- Whose is that?
- Daphne's.

30:55.852 --> 30:57.851
Oh, Leslie.

30:59.850 --> 31:02.848
- Oh, a... a letter from Larry.
- Oh, thank you, darling.

31:06.886 --> 31:10.808
- Why has Basil bought us a bridge?
- Yes, that did seem odd.

31:10.843 --> 31:12.807
'Dear Mother.

31:12.842 --> 31:15.805
'Enchante to hear
that Margo's nesting with Theo.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.804
- 'Is that a secret?'
- Hah!

31:17.839 --> 31:20.802
Erm, can you babysit Daphne's baby
while I'm hunting?

31:20.837 --> 31:22.801
Oh, no, darling,
I have to go back to town.

31:22.836 --> 31:25.799
- Oh, well...
- This is much better.

31:25.834 --> 31:28.832
You stay here and be Daddy,
as you said you wanted to.

31:33.829 --> 31:35.828
What the hell am I going to do with you?

31:39.666 --> 31:42.789
- Lovely day for it.
- I'm not talking to you!

31:42.824 --> 31:43.823
Fine.

32:02.812 --> 32:04.776
You'd have been court-martialled
for that in a war.

32:04.811 --> 32:07.774
- Highly unprofessional.
- I've said I'm sorry.

32:07.809 --> 32:09.613
RUSTLING NOISE

32:09.648 --> 32:10.772
GUNFIRE

32:10.807 --> 32:12.771
BABY SCREAMS AND CRIES

32:12.806 --> 32:15.844
- Don't make me shoot the baby.
- That's not funny.

32:18.802 --> 32:20.801
- Please shush.
- CRYING CONTINUES

32:21.800 --> 32:23.799
- Shh.
- Shh!

32:25.838 --> 32:28.476
Let's just clog your ears up.

32:33.313 --> 32:34.792
IMITATES WILD BOAR

32:37.791 --> 32:39.754
Th... that's a wild boar.

32:39.789 --> 32:41.753
How exciting, I told you
I'd find you some.

32:41.788 --> 32:42.753
Isn't it coming from up a tree?

32:42.788 --> 32:47.625
Hardly, they can't climb trees.
You're thinking of a squirrel.

32:48.784 --> 32:49.783
GUNFIRE

32:51.822 --> 32:53.746
This way.

32:53.781 --> 32:55.745
Are you sure about this?

32:55.780 --> 32:57.779
We could get shot and killed.

32:58.778 --> 32:59.777
Are YOU sure about it?

33:08.772 --> 33:09.771
KNOCK

33:15.288 --> 33:17.731
Hello. How nice...

33:17.766 --> 33:20.730
It's all right, Theo, I know.

33:20.765 --> 33:22.728
I did try to persuade Margo to tell you.

33:22.763 --> 33:24.727
Well, you should have asked me,

33:24.762 --> 33:27.760
I have a range of techniques
for calling Margo to heel.

33:31.758 --> 33:32.757
Oh...

33:37.754 --> 33:40.718
I was forgetting what you looked like.

33:40.753 --> 33:44.235
After a week?
What kind of mother are you?

33:44.270 --> 33:46.429
I don't know.

33:47.748 --> 33:49.747
BABY CRYING

33:51.746 --> 33:53.745
Oh, God, this is horrible.

33:57.742 --> 34:00.740
Let's hope this is the last
of your stinking effluent.

34:13.733 --> 34:15.571
IMITATES WILD BOAR

34:17.730 --> 34:19.728
BASIL IMITATING WILD BOAR

34:20.728 --> 34:22.726
LOUD GONG AND TAMBOURINE

34:24.726 --> 34:27.688
- Shoo, scat. - Pavste!
- REPEATED GONG

34:27.724 --> 34:29.688
- Hunting is wrong!
- Stop this cruelty!

34:29.723 --> 34:32.686
Drop your guns
and cuddle an animal today!

34:32.721 --> 34:34.719
GUNSHOT

34:35.719 --> 34:37.882
How dare you! My mother loves that gong!

34:37.918 --> 34:39.681
Well, you're wasting your bloody breath

34:39.717 --> 34:42.679
because there are no wild boar
in these woods anyway!

34:42.715 --> 34:44.679
Probably because
they've all been gunned down.

34:44.714 --> 34:46.678
They need protecting!

34:46.713 --> 34:50.710
In fact, there are wild boar here,
because we heard the bastards.

34:54.708 --> 34:56.706
SHRIEKS

35:13.696 --> 35:16.660
I will see you... in court.

35:16.695 --> 35:19.693
Look, I was just trying to give you
good value for money!

35:20.692 --> 35:22.656
You think I'm a buffoon, do you?

35:22.691 --> 35:24.655
- You must be.
- No.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.653
Killing isn't a sport, it's a sickness!

35:26.688 --> 35:28.687
Gerry!

35:39.681 --> 35:42.644
- 'Fire!'
- BATTLEFIELD SOUNDS

35:42.679 --> 35:44.678
'Fire your weapon!

35:47.676 --> 35:51.713
'For God's sake,
do something, man! Fire!

35:53.672 --> 35:56.635
'Colonel! Colonel!

35:56.670 --> 35:58.869
'Colonel!'

36:06.664 --> 36:08.663
You could have killed my brother!

36:29.650 --> 36:32.134
Margo, I love you and I miss you.

36:32.169 --> 36:35.612
And I need you at home,
as a... as a daughter

36:35.647 --> 36:38.610
- and frankly as a woman.
- You've got Lugaretzia.

36:38.645 --> 36:41.608
Oh, she's off with her bad back
or her bottom

36:41.643 --> 36:43.607
or whatever it is this time.

36:43.642 --> 36:45.606
Have I been so terrible?

36:45.641 --> 36:50.603
No! But you're very... dominant.

36:50.638 --> 36:52.601
No, I'm not!

36:52.636 --> 36:53.601
You'd never come to me for advice,

36:53.636 --> 36:56.599
because you only really listen to Larry.

36:56.634 --> 36:58.598
- You only miss me now I'm gone.
- Oh, Margo.

36:58.633 --> 37:01.596
- Anyway, I've bothered Theo enough.
- No, no, no, no.

37:01.631 --> 37:04.594
- So I'm moving out.
- Oh, thank you, darling...

37:04.629 --> 37:08.592
- And I'm going to England.
- No... Why?

37:08.627 --> 37:10.591
I haven't been there for years.

37:10.626 --> 37:12.949
I need to train properly in beauty,

37:12.984 --> 37:15.588
I just need to do something brave.

37:15.623 --> 37:19.585
Well, you'll soon discover
there's no place like home.

37:19.620 --> 37:22.583
But where is home? I love Corfu,

37:22.618 --> 37:24.782
but you turned us into nomads
when you brought us here.

37:24.817 --> 37:26.976
Home is...

37:28.615 --> 37:32.612
- ...where I am.
- You see? That's you being dominant.

37:34.611 --> 37:38.129
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know.

37:45.604 --> 37:47.603
Theo, you can keep my lovely pictures.

38:17.585 --> 38:20.548
I'm sorry it wasn't a huge success.
If you want your money back...

38:20.583 --> 38:24.581
You stopped me committing murder.
I'm hardly going to expect a refund.

38:25.580 --> 38:28.543
I know what it's like, haunting
flashbacks to the battlefield.

38:28.578 --> 38:31.542
- They're hard to shake off.
- Where did you serve?

38:31.577 --> 38:34.575
Yeovil College for trainee solicitors.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.538
Not all of the lads made it.

38:37.573 --> 38:40.536
Well, thank goodness you're all safe.

38:40.571 --> 38:43.534
- Galini and I stopped the slaughter.
- LESLIE: No, you didn't.

38:43.569 --> 38:46.533
- He shot your gong.
- It's still perfectly sound.

38:46.568 --> 38:49.571
- Oh, really? Does THIS sound sound?
- WARPED GONG SOUNDS

38:49.606 --> 38:51.530
- You are so self-righteous.
- Oh, am I?

38:51.565 --> 38:54.208
- And what does that make you?
- Why don't you tell me?

38:54.243 --> 38:55.527
Shut up!

38:55.562 --> 39:00.524
Are you going to ask me how am?
In this house of men?

39:00.559 --> 39:02.523
- As my family disintegrates?
- What?

39:02.558 --> 39:04.557
- Who's disintegrating?
- How are you?

39:09.913 --> 39:11.877
KNOCK

39:11.912 --> 39:14.551
- Yes?
- It's a man.

39:15.550 --> 39:18.548
- Would you prefer to rendezvous on the landing?
- No.

39:20.547 --> 39:22.546
Sorry to penetrate your bolt-hole.

39:24.065 --> 39:29.027
I'm worried I wasn't very clear,
when I gave you the bridge.

39:29.062 --> 39:31.505
Yes, what was that all about?

39:31.540 --> 39:34.703
I asked you what you liked

39:34.738 --> 39:37.537
and you said "a bridge".

39:39.536 --> 39:44.338
No, I said I like, "er, bridge".

39:44.373 --> 39:48.530
The card game.
My husband and I used to play.

39:49.529 --> 39:51.528
Oh, bugger.

39:53.527 --> 39:55.011
Do you like bridges?

39:55.046 --> 39:58.489
Well, I'm glad they exist,
for crossing water.

39:58.524 --> 40:00.488
Anyway...

40:00.523 --> 40:04.685
the bridge is merely a metaphor,
in wood,

40:04.720 --> 40:10.002
- of my love for you.
- Oh.

40:10.037 --> 40:15.998
Your warmth and beauty
illuminate every room you enter.

40:16.033 --> 40:18.477
I came for a fortnight's holiday

40:18.512 --> 40:24.473
and months later, I am still here,
waiting and wanting.

40:24.508 --> 40:28.866
So, how about it, you and me?

40:30.505 --> 40:33.543
No, I have no romantic feelings for you.

40:34.542 --> 40:36.541
We are related after all.

40:41.498 --> 40:43.497
- It's very distant.
- Not distant enough.

40:45.496 --> 40:47.494
- I don't think you should sit on my bed.
- Right, sorry.

40:50.852 --> 40:54.455
And of course, there is Spiros.

40:54.490 --> 40:58.493
Why eat boiled beef when
there's hot souvlaki on the menu?

40:58.528 --> 41:00.452
He's not on the menu.

41:00.487 --> 41:03.969
Well, I'll leave tomorrow.

41:04.004 --> 41:07.447
No, look, Basil, stay.

41:07.482 --> 41:11.445
Stop having English clothes sent over,

41:11.480 --> 41:14.483
relax, find someone nice here.

41:14.518 --> 41:16.477
Who isn't me.

41:21.474 --> 41:23.153
CAR HORN

41:25.671 --> 41:28.435
- Ladies.
- Thanks, Spiros!

41:28.470 --> 41:31.468
- Pleasure. - You're a darling!
- You're welcome.

41:34.466 --> 41:36.465
- Mrs D!
- Swim with us!

41:39.463 --> 41:40.467
- SCREAM
- Look at the sea!

41:40.502 --> 41:42.461
Oh, it's so good to be back.

41:49.457 --> 41:51.940
You want me to apologise
for caring about you?

41:51.975 --> 41:53.420
This isn't caring.

41:53.454 --> 41:55.418
This is having your cake and eating it.

41:55.453 --> 41:57.417
- What does that mean?
- It means,

41:57.452 --> 41:59.616
you have a wife you want to keep

41:59.651 --> 42:02.449
and me here waiting for you,
just in case.

42:04.448 --> 42:05.487
I'm sorry...

42:07.446 --> 42:08.965
That's not fair.

42:09.965 --> 42:13.442
But we've tried to be normal
together and we just can't do it.

42:15.121 --> 42:16.441
I know.

42:18.439 --> 42:20.438
I'm sorry.

42:48.421 --> 42:51.384
Leslie's busy
putting the baby down to sleep,

42:51.419 --> 42:53.418
but I'm here if you want
a deputy confidant.

42:54.418 --> 42:56.416
Thank you.

42:59.415 --> 43:01.413
LAUGHING AND SCREAMING

43:02.413 --> 43:05.411
They're swimming naked, aren't they?

43:07.770 --> 43:09.374
Er, I think I will stay on.

43:09.409 --> 43:12.372
I'll just take the dancers
their towels...

43:12.407 --> 43:15.370
They'll dry... in the sun.

43:15.405 --> 43:17.404
Go on, in you go.

43:20.402 --> 43:25.364
Oh, Lugaretzia, what
an absolute pleasure to see you.

43:25.399 --> 43:27.363
You also.

43:27.398 --> 43:30.361
And how is your bad back
or bottom or wherever it is?

43:30.396 --> 43:33.394
- Ah, less bad, thank you.
- Good.

43:36.392 --> 43:39.355
- There are naked ladies in the sea!
- I know.

43:39.390 --> 43:40.715
What can you do?

43:40.750 --> 43:43.353
Yeah, we danced for our supper
in Athens.

43:43.388 --> 43:45.032
And we're joining Larry up the coast.

43:45.067 --> 43:47.351
He's promised to give us a huge welcome.

43:47.386 --> 43:51.348
Oh, I bet he has.
Well, tell him we'll visit soon.

43:51.383 --> 43:53.347
- DOOR OPENS
- Theo told me you're missing

43:53.382 --> 43:55.346
- female company.
- Aw!

43:55.381 --> 43:57.345
Thank you, Florence.

43:57.380 --> 44:00.343
Yes, it's been like
a working men's club here.

44:00.378 --> 44:02.342
Come in and spread a little daintiness.

44:02.376 --> 44:05.340
Oh, you seem to be doing all right.

44:05.375 --> 44:07.338
Still, we're here now. I bring wine

44:07.373 --> 44:10.337
and surgery gossip involving
sexually transmitted diseases.

44:10.372 --> 44:12.370
- Oh!
- THEY LAUGH

44:14.369 --> 44:18.332
I'll, er, I'll be making
my farewells, Mrs Durrell.

44:18.367 --> 44:20.331
Oh, I'm sorry, Colonel. Why?

44:20.366 --> 44:23.329
Well, I feel I need
a new challenge in my life,

44:23.364 --> 44:25.328
one that doesn't involve firearms.

44:25.363 --> 44:27.846
Well, you could stay and...

44:27.881 --> 44:30.360
go for walks or read books.

44:31.359 --> 44:34.002
Anyway, I'll leave my guns for Leslie.

44:34.037 --> 44:36.361
He's a fine lad,
despite his baby fetish.

44:36.396 --> 44:39.319
- Ah, here's Daphne.
- Aw, hi!

44:39.354 --> 44:41.353
- COLONEL CLEARS HIS THROAT
- Afti pali?

44:42.712 --> 44:45.355
So many women. Where's Margo?

44:45.390 --> 44:48.314
Margo is going to try England.

44:48.349 --> 44:51.312
Oh, good for her!

44:51.347 --> 44:54.025
Yes. Good for her.

45:04.339 --> 45:07.302
So is that you done for children?

45:07.337 --> 45:09.301
Ugh, yeah, they're a nightmare.

45:09.336 --> 45:12.299
Listen, I know I haven't been
a good confidant to you so far.

45:12.334 --> 45:14.298
Well, I'll need you later
to shore me up.

45:14.333 --> 45:17.296
I can't see Spiros any more
and Margo's going away.

45:17.331 --> 45:18.975
No, I won't make sense later,

45:19.010 --> 45:22.328
I'm off to get slaughtered
with Basil and the Colonel. Bye!

45:26.326 --> 45:29.329
At last. This is so lovely!

45:29.364 --> 45:32.322
- Isn't it!
- Yes, go on.

45:37.319 --> 45:39.283
Do we need some men?

45:39.318 --> 45:42.121
Might be nice.

45:42.156 --> 45:44.315
- THEY LAUGH
- ALL: Yamas!

45:50.311 --> 45:52.275
- Hello, Aunty, Uncle.
- What?

45:52.310 --> 45:54.314
My daughter Maud's governess
had to leave suddenly

45:54.349 --> 45:56.273
