WEBVTT

00:55.680 --> 00:56.973
You're drinking a lot.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.936
Is something going on?

01:11.488 --> 01:12.489
No.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.493
Nothing.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.246
<i>Is work going well?</i>

01:21.539 --> 01:24.959
<i>No, I came outside
because I couldn't focus.</i>

01:26.878 --> 01:30.965
<i>Na-bi keeps looking somewhere else
instead of looking at me.</i>

01:32.467 --> 01:34.177
I saw you with him

01:35.553 --> 01:36.805
at school.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.310
-What?
-Yang Do-hyeok.

01:46.689 --> 01:47.732
I see.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.739
Do you like him?

01:57.784 --> 01:59.577
Why do you ask?

02:02.247 --> 02:05.375
I'm just curious.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.965
I do.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.718
He's a good guy.

02:30.358 --> 02:31.734
What makes you say that?

02:36.239 --> 02:37.949
He's a good cook,

02:39.826 --> 02:41.452
and he's considerate.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.832
He's cute sometimes too.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.964
And most of all,
I feel comfortable when I'm with him.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.768
Then why aren't you dating him?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.028
That's not something you should be asking.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.073
Maybe not.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.461
If I date him,
he'd get disappointed in me.

03:35.256 --> 03:38.176
I'm not the kind of person he thinks I am.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.141
At least to him,

03:48.478 --> 03:50.939
I want to seem like a good person.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.036
Then what about me?

04:18.591 --> 04:24.555
EPISODE 9: I KNOW IT'S OVER.
NEVERTHELESS,

04:29.894 --> 04:32.981
-Do you like her that much?
-Yes, I do.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.566
And I miss her all the time.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.278
Then what are you waiting for?
Be more bold.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.448
Well, I can't really do that right now.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.952
I feel like I might mess things up.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.621
My goodness. So frustrating.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.250
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

04:56.129 --> 04:57.714
DID YOU GO HOME?
ARE YOU HAVING FUN?

04:59.716 --> 05:00.842
Is she home?

05:01.342 --> 05:03.011
Don't look.

05:03.928 --> 05:07.181
-Look at what?
-Not you. Just keep sleeping.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.599
Sorry.

05:09.684 --> 05:10.560
Do-hyeok.

05:11.894 --> 05:14.397
Just take my advice,
and ask her to meet up right now.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.482
You said you forgot to give her that.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.443
That's a bit…

05:19.235 --> 05:20.528
It's not even urgent.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.866
Plus, I'm a bit tipsy.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.035
So frustrating.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.079
You're a decent guy,
but you're not making any bold moves.

05:34.625 --> 05:38.504
Love is all about timing, you know.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.549
If you keep hesitating like that,
you'll never get her.

05:42.842 --> 05:46.679
It's because
I really don't want to lose her.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.099
If you don't want to lose her,
then ask her to meet right now.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.812
If you're not going to,
then just bring another bottle.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.272
We're out.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.150
All right.

06:14.248 --> 06:15.625
I'll get going now.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.293
Are you walking home?

06:18.169 --> 06:21.672
Yes. I should sober up a bit.
See you tomorrow, then.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.187
Why are you following me?

06:37.021 --> 06:38.147
I'm not following you.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.782
Then where are you going?

06:47.865 --> 06:48.991
Your house.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.910
-What?
-To get my stuff.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.371
I see.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.892
She won't be asleep already, will she?

07:33.369 --> 07:35.955
-Wait out here.
-Out here?

07:36.622 --> 07:39.876
I didn't pack everything yet.
I didn't think you'd suddenly come for it.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.171
I'll pack them with you.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.518
I can go inside, right?

07:58.769 --> 07:59.770
Sure.

08:14.368 --> 08:17.246
-Cheers.
-You have to clink glasses.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.584
Look over there. Isn't that guy handsome?

08:22.168 --> 08:23.628
What's with you?

08:25.880 --> 08:28.674
Hey, slow down.
We didn't come here to drink, you know.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.551
I came here to drink.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.930
-You're unbelievable.
-Why did we come here then?

08:34.680 --> 08:36.599
Look at that guy.

08:36.682 --> 08:40.186
-I think the cute guys are over there.
-There are so many decent guys.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.604
-Are you lonely?
-Yes.

08:46.901 --> 08:50.363
That guy over there looks pretty cute too.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.241
SHARE WITH
NAM GYU-HYUN

08:57.078 --> 08:59.997
Hey. My friends
say they want to come here too.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.541
Three guys. What do you think?

09:01.624 --> 09:03.543
That's perfect. Tell them to come.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.421
Are they good-looking?

09:07.505 --> 09:08.422
I'm leaving.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.091
-What?
-Hey.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.511
-Have fun.
-Hey!

09:15.680 --> 09:18.099
Jeez. Call just two guys, then.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.080
Do you like it?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.249
Yes.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.502
It's pretty.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.464
You look even more pretty today.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.339
<i>HUMAN ART ANATOMY FOR SCULPTORS</i>

10:31.422 --> 10:35.051
I think that's all your stuff.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.177
Right.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.721
But I feel a bit disappointed.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.642
-What do you mean?
-I thought you'd have

10:44.393 --> 10:46.270
a late birthday present for me.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.774
There's nothing like that.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.485
If that's everything,
you should get going.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.236
I'm a bit tired.

11:14.548 --> 11:15.758
You're all better now.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.219
Yes.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.055
I did a good job of treating you.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.951
Let's not make another mistake.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.079
You should go.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.816
Do you really think this is a mistake?

12:16.610 --> 12:19.155
Of course. I'm sure you feel the same.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.740
<i>That's a lie.</i>

12:26.036 --> 12:27.163
I don't.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.044
I enjoy being with you.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.213
Are you kidding me?

12:38.632 --> 12:40.885
I like your angry face too.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.887
Is this fun to you?

12:44.847 --> 12:46.390
I'm not teasing you.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.062
Let's go out.

12:55.733 --> 12:56.567
What?

13:06.368 --> 13:08.120
Think about it and tell me.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.123
Bye.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.464
Go sleep in the bedroom.
You'll catch a cold.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.466
No, I can't sleep right now.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.759
I still have lots to do.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.553
What?

14:06.136 --> 14:09.390
What? She got in, but Na-bi got rejected?

14:09.473 --> 14:12.309
The school Na-bi applied to
is pretty tough to get into.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.435
Right.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.146
I have to make all the calls
and prepare the documents.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.650
I'm totally screwed.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.610
I can help you make the calls tomorrow.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.195
So go to bed.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.364
It's fine. You have a lot to do too.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.449
I have some time tomorrow.

14:29.910 --> 14:30.744
What?

14:31.662 --> 14:32.496
Well…

14:32.580 --> 14:34.665
I feel kind of embarrassed.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.000
Why?

14:36.083 --> 14:39.628
I always told you to stop poking
your nose in other people's businesses.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.631
But it feels like
I'm getting the most benefit out of that.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.302
That means you're thankful, right?

14:46.385 --> 14:49.847
Well, I guess.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.643
You're likeable.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.271
What?

14:58.606 --> 15:00.190
It stays near you all the time.

15:03.402 --> 15:07.114
Oh, I guess you're right.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.056
Let's go out.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.426
<i>I'm not used to how I am</i>

16:54.304 --> 16:55.556
<i>when I'm with Na-bi.</i>

17:13.699 --> 17:14.825
Let's go out.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.707
What was that, all of a sudden?

17:29.381 --> 17:31.383
Did he really mean it?

17:46.982 --> 17:49.359
<i>Can we meet right now?</i>

18:09.004 --> 18:10.798
<i>I just read your message. Sorry.</i>

18:12.091 --> 18:14.635
<i>If it's not urgent, let's meet next time.</i>

18:14.718 --> 18:17.638
<i>I'm a bit tired,
so I'm going to bed early.</i>

18:24.561 --> 18:26.855
YU NA-BI

18:47.334 --> 18:48.335
Block him!

18:54.633 --> 18:56.635
I guess you're not
in a good condition today.

18:57.219 --> 19:00.013
-You seem way too tense.
-I'm not improving.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.432
I want to be better.

19:03.016 --> 19:06.520
Things won't work out well
if you start to get greedy.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.856
Did I get greedy?

19:08.939 --> 19:12.359
It's nothing bad.
You can try harder if you get greedy.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.238
So do your best.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.450
Come on, let's play another game.

19:21.535 --> 19:22.578
Okay.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.793
-Hi, Na-bi. Hi, Sol.
-Hey.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.342
Sol.

19:39.553 --> 19:40.846
-Sol.
-Yes?

19:40.929 --> 19:45.017
What if someone says "Let's go out"
without even saying they like you?

19:45.767 --> 19:46.810
It's one or the other.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.980
That person's a jerk

19:50.063 --> 19:53.734
or they thought it was unnecessary
because it's so obvious.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.325
What time is your progress report?

20:03.118 --> 20:04.036
Progress report?

20:05.454 --> 20:06.788
For the exhibition.

20:08.957 --> 20:09.917
Oh, right.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.669
-When was it?
-Tomorrow.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.713
You didn't prepare for it?

20:16.715 --> 20:17.716
No.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.718
What? Is something going on?

20:20.510 --> 20:21.803
No.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.475
-Hey, Ji-wan.
-What?

20:29.937 --> 20:32.189
Na-bi, I'll be in the lecture room.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.232
We can go together.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.692
No, it's fine. See you later.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.614
What's up with her?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.034
I don't know.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.422
Nothing has changed here.

21:46.054 --> 21:47.222
Hey, Do-hyeok.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.934
Do you remember that spot?

21:51.643 --> 21:53.812
We were playing in there

21:53.895 --> 21:57.607
and I broke a glass cup,
and you got scolded by your grandpa.

21:57.691 --> 21:58.984
You remember that?

21:59.067 --> 22:00.277
Of course.

22:01.737 --> 22:05.407
Back then, it was so fun
to hide somewhere and play.

22:06.241 --> 22:10.329
Right. It was so exciting
when we were in elementary school.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.496
Yes.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.593
You're pretty good.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.099
Make it tasty for me.

22:31.975 --> 22:33.810
All right.

22:37.355 --> 22:38.648
Do-hyeok!

22:41.485 --> 22:43.612
The reactions are great.

22:45.113 --> 22:48.075
Listening to Na-bi's advice
was a great idea.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.342
Try tasting this.

23:12.849 --> 23:15.727
-Why does it taste like this?
-Why? Is it bad?

23:24.152 --> 23:26.571
Hey. Grandson of a noodle shop owner.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.407
What happened in Seoul?
Why are you acting like this?

23:29.491 --> 23:31.034
Nothing happened.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.831
You were so excited to see Na-bi.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.667
But you look like a zombie now.
Stop lying.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.003
Did you eventually lose to Jae-eon?

23:44.005 --> 23:47.676
My gosh.
Just give up and find someone else.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.387
You're popular, you know.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.055
Can you make some noodles for me?

23:52.681 --> 23:54.057
I'm hungry.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.060
Make it yourself.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.495
Should I just give up on everything?

24:34.389 --> 24:35.307
Jae-eon.

24:36.516 --> 24:37.893
What are you making?

24:38.768 --> 24:39.644
A pendant.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.481
Then what's this?

24:54.868 --> 24:55.785
Thanks.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.651
Was it that good?

25:29.069 --> 25:30.320
What do you mean?

25:30.403 --> 25:31.488
The meat.

25:32.113 --> 25:35.992
The barbecue was amazing that day,
wasn't it?

25:39.579 --> 25:42.540
What's he going around doing these days?

25:42.624 --> 25:44.709
He works part-time at an internet cafe.

25:45.502 --> 25:48.380
-A part-time job?
-Yes. You didn't know?

25:48.463 --> 25:50.340
I thought you two shared everything.

25:50.423 --> 25:54.302
The internet cafe he works at
has a really romantic name.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.220
What is it?

26:00.183 --> 26:02.811
Gyu-hyun,
do you want to have drinks today?

26:02.894 --> 26:06.189
Not me.
I have gastritis, so I can't drink.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.649
What? Gastritis?

26:08.149 --> 26:09.526
You're totally healthy.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.028
Whatever!

26:12.737 --> 26:15.115
-It must be because of stress.
-Hey, Bit-na.

26:17.575 --> 26:18.785
What?

26:18.868 --> 26:20.996
Let's go somewhere and talk.

26:22.122 --> 26:24.332
-Just talk here.
-It won't take long.

26:28.753 --> 26:29.754
What the…

26:43.852 --> 26:45.312
What? What is it?

26:48.773 --> 26:51.609
-Oh, this…
-Why did you order this to my house?

26:59.034 --> 27:01.619
I've made a grave mistake.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.080
Is this what you wanted to say?

27:04.998 --> 27:05.999
Yes.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.586
All right, then.

27:11.338 --> 27:12.756
Isn't that mine?

27:13.673 --> 27:16.760
You gave this to me to wear last time.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.011
Do you want it back?

27:19.054 --> 27:20.430
No, it's fine.

27:22.766 --> 27:26.436
You're actually really petty, aren't you?

27:27.020 --> 27:27.979
Just take it.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.820
What are you doing this weekend?

27:35.904 --> 27:37.238
Well…

27:40.825 --> 27:42.994
This exhibition's opening this week.

27:43.703 --> 27:44.996
PARK DAE-SEONG EXHIBITION

27:45.580 --> 27:46.581
Let's go together.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.166
Together?

27:49.709 --> 27:51.461
Yes. I'm asking you out on a date.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.256
I like you, Sol.

27:56.424 --> 27:58.635
I've liked you since I first met you
at the cafe.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.596
Oh…

28:02.514 --> 28:04.599
You're not seeing anyone, are you?

28:05.392 --> 28:07.060
I'm not, but…

28:09.187 --> 28:11.064
I actually have someone I like.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.236
I see. Do you have a crush on someone?

28:22.325 --> 28:23.451
Then did you…

28:24.661 --> 28:27.288
I guess it's too personal. I'm sorry.

28:27.789 --> 28:30.500
I did tell them how I feel.

28:31.918 --> 28:33.837
Because my desires kept growing.

28:35.880 --> 28:36.714
I see.

28:39.175 --> 28:41.052
So you're saying

28:41.136 --> 28:43.555
that your friend said they like you

28:43.638 --> 28:45.014
and you like them back.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.977
But you're afraid
of ruining your friendship?

28:49.060 --> 28:53.314
Yes. If we start dating
but break up later…

28:53.398 --> 28:56.985
My friend is capable and has everything,

28:57.694 --> 28:59.738
so losing me won't be a big deal.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.531
But without my friend,

29:01.614 --> 29:04.826
it'd be the same as losing half my life.

29:05.493 --> 29:07.162
I'd be screwed.

29:10.457 --> 29:11.458
I envy you.

29:12.041 --> 29:15.920
What? I'm so confused right now.
Why would you envy me?

29:16.004 --> 29:17.964
Your friend's your other half.

29:18.047 --> 29:21.801
That means you're both
so sure about your feelings.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.096
That's a great thing.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.556
Still…

29:28.391 --> 29:30.185
Plus, from my experience…

29:31.019 --> 29:32.103
I mean,

29:32.729 --> 29:36.399
what I think is that you two
can't go back to the way things were.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.527
Unless you both lose your memories,

29:39.611 --> 29:41.738
you'll never be able
to just be friends again.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.701
Please stop stating cold hard facts.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.498
So don't suffer like this all by yourself
and talk to your friend.

29:51.581 --> 29:52.874
Who knows?

29:52.957 --> 29:55.376
That friend
might be thinking the same thing.

29:58.046 --> 30:01.674
I'm scared to tell them though.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.220
I know how that feels.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.198
EXCHANGE PROGRAM APPLICATION RESULTS

30:27.116 --> 30:29.911
YU NA-BI
REJECTED

30:41.714 --> 30:44.384
It doesn't seem that bad,

30:45.260 --> 30:47.595
but it's not as good as I expected.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.811
Don't you have two assistants?
Where's the other one?

30:56.020 --> 30:58.523
Jin-su is at his part-time job right now.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.692
Are you getting a lot of help from them?

31:04.654 --> 31:06.865
Yes, they're helping out a lot.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.741
We have meetings often too.

31:11.953 --> 31:12.829
Is that so?

31:17.709 --> 31:20.670
I thought you two
would make a great piece together.

31:21.754 --> 31:24.591
I guess you two haven't
figured out each other's strong points.

31:28.386 --> 31:31.180
Na-bi. I've told you this
many times before.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.433
You really have talent,

31:34.267 --> 31:37.729
but I can't feel your emotion
in your works.

31:38.521 --> 31:40.607
It's not just about finishing your piece.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.567
You have to inspire other people.

31:43.151 --> 31:46.821
Pieces that receive compliments and
ones that attract attention are different.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.782
Right.

31:50.366 --> 31:53.870
Are you passionate about this piece?
Do you really care about it?

31:55.830 --> 31:56.873
Of course.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.961
I'm sure you'd feel upset
about me saying this when you tried hard.

32:02.045 --> 32:05.173
You may think it's nonsense,
but it's because I know you can do better.

32:05.256 --> 32:08.593
I really think you can make
an amazing piece with just a bit more.

32:13.932 --> 32:17.101
I wanted you to learn that from Jae-eon.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.693
I'll do my best.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.115
Let me see yours, Geon-ung.

32:37.914 --> 32:43.252
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK TRIPE

33:04.524 --> 33:05.483
Here you go.

33:13.866 --> 33:15.952
This tastes amazing.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.040
How was the critique?

33:23.126 --> 33:24.335
Awful.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.755
Come on. Everybody gets criticized
by that professor.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.051
Except for Jae-eon, I guess.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.554
Aren't you busy?

33:35.138 --> 33:36.472
I am,

33:37.348 --> 33:40.560
but I should take good care of you guys.

33:40.643 --> 33:42.687
This and this…

33:47.233 --> 33:48.568
Isn't it good?

33:49.152 --> 33:50.445
It is.

33:52.905 --> 33:56.492
I'm sorry for not being able to make it.
I'll get you a lot of freebies.

33:56.576 --> 33:59.287
It's fine. Thanks.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.873
Enjoy your food.

34:02.582 --> 34:04.709
This is pretty good.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.837
I promise I won't miss anything
or be late next time.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.761
This must be about Gyu-hyun.

34:15.344 --> 34:16.387
What? Let me see.

34:17.930 --> 34:19.724
"I heard he's a Sculpture major.

34:19.807 --> 34:22.185
He's totally my style.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.228
I'm going to the internet cafe every day.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.190
Please give me 22 extra minutes
as a sign, if you like me too."

34:27.690 --> 34:29.692
This is Gyu-hyun for sure!

34:31.027 --> 34:33.154
"Handsome"?
Are you kidding me? Is that it?

34:33.237 --> 34:34.280
Yes.

34:38.618 --> 34:40.078
What is this?

34:41.621 --> 34:44.332
What? There are more female customers now?

34:45.583 --> 34:47.543
YOU'VE PASSED THE FIRST SCREENING TEST

34:48.294 --> 34:52.256
I passed! I can't believe it!

34:53.466 --> 34:54.300
Oh, my gosh.

34:56.469 --> 34:59.555
I acted like I got the job already.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.557
I just passed the first test.

35:02.141 --> 35:05.186
Come on. That's a huge achievement.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.313
Then you should prepare
for the interview now.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.233
Good luck!

35:49.605 --> 35:51.858
<i>The ocean is so pretty, Do-hyeok.</i>

35:51.941 --> 35:53.192
I miss you.

36:06.622 --> 36:07.957
<i>I saw the new video.</i>

36:08.541 --> 36:09.500
<i>It's great.</i>

36:14.005 --> 36:15.840
Emotions…

36:24.098 --> 36:25.975
Emotions…

36:31.564 --> 36:35.568
How do I portray my emotions?

36:56.297 --> 36:57.506
Hey, Do-hyeok.

36:59.175 --> 37:02.678
<i>Can you talk right now?
I don't want to bother you.</i>

37:02.762 --> 37:06.390
No, it's fine. I was spacing out
because the critique went badly.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.726
<i>-Critique?</i>
-Our professor

37:08.809 --> 37:11.395
evaluates and critiques our works.

37:14.398 --> 37:15.900
I got scolded.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.986
This semester really is the worst.

37:20.947 --> 37:23.574
I didn't get accepted
to the exchange program either.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.493
<i>Oh…</i>

37:47.014 --> 37:47.890
<i>Is something going on?</i>

37:48.891 --> 37:49.892
No.

37:51.894 --> 37:52.895
Nothing.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.231
Let's not make another mistake.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.110
<i>Maybe Na-bi was already</i>

38:00.027 --> 38:02.405
<i>drifting away from me.</i>

38:16.127 --> 38:17.211
<i>That's too bad.</i>

38:17.295 --> 38:20.256
<i>That school has a bad eye for talent.</i>

38:21.257 --> 38:24.885
<i>I'm going to Seoul soon. Can we meet up?</i>

38:26.012 --> 38:28.347
Of course. When are you coming?

38:28.431 --> 38:29.682
<i>It's not decided yet.</i>

38:31.976 --> 38:35.771
I guess you're feeling bothered
by what I said.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.275
Are you trying to cheer me up?

38:39.942 --> 38:43.654
Na-bi. You're already doing so well.

38:44.196 --> 38:47.116
So don't let that discourage you.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.953
Thanks.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.788
You know I'm your greatest fan, right?

38:52.872 --> 38:54.457
Make use of me all you want.

38:55.791 --> 38:58.794
You can call me whenever
you need something to cheer you up.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.089
I'll rush right over.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.300
<i>Thanks for saying that.</i>

39:04.383 --> 39:06.135
I feel a bit better.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.848
Anyway, I'll call you again later.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.516
Bye.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.026
Did I go overboard?

39:23.069 --> 39:24.278
I'm getting married.

39:24.987 --> 39:26.572
What? You're getting married?

39:27.281 --> 39:28.532
Why are you so startled?

39:28.616 --> 39:30.284
When will you get married?

39:30.368 --> 39:31.952
The beginning of next year?

39:32.036 --> 39:34.038
I feel like we'd break up if we don't.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.457
It's already been over five years.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.085
And we've been working
for three years now.

39:39.585 --> 39:41.295
I wanted some change in my life.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.506
It's like a turning point
in our relationship.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.345
A turning point in a relationship…

39:58.145 --> 39:59.063
Sol.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.442
-Yes?
-If I say

40:04.735 --> 40:06.028
that I don't like you

40:06.737 --> 40:09.365
in that way…

40:12.118 --> 40:13.744
Then what will happen to us?

40:18.999 --> 40:20.584
Then I'll keep liking you

40:21.210 --> 40:22.962
like I do now,

40:25.047 --> 40:27.216
and you won't return my feelings.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.096
And if I say I do like you?

40:33.514 --> 40:34.515
What?

40:37.351 --> 40:39.812
Then we'll break up someday.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.943
But I don't want us
to stay like this, either.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.790
Is that what was troubling you?

41:01.542 --> 41:02.710
What do we do?

41:10.759 --> 41:11.594
Seo Ji-wan.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.805
My feelings will never change.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.146
So…

41:23.814 --> 41:25.107
don't worry.

41:52.134 --> 41:53.302
Are you done?

41:54.762 --> 41:56.472
Yes. I'm going to head home now.

41:57.431 --> 41:59.600
Let's go. I'll take you home.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.685
It's fine. It's not far.

42:01.769 --> 42:05.064
I was waiting all this time
to go with you.

42:06.815 --> 42:09.401
I heard you stayed up all night.
You must be tired.

42:24.792 --> 42:27.294
Thanks for the ride. I'll get going.

42:29.255 --> 42:30.381
Wait.

42:39.974 --> 42:41.183
A present.

42:56.156 --> 42:57.616
Did you make this?

42:57.700 --> 43:00.119
Yes, while I was working on my pieces.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.204
It's pretty.

43:03.455 --> 43:05.124
You could actually sell this.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.753
Why are things so funny when you say them?

43:12.798 --> 43:15.259
Go inside. And get some sleep.

43:17.511 --> 43:19.471
I will. Thanks.

44:02.556 --> 44:05.225
INTERNET CAFE PART-TIMER
THE PART-TIMER AT PERHAPS LOVE IS HOT

44:07.186 --> 44:08.479
Hey, Bit-na!

44:09.813 --> 44:11.774
Hey, my trainer! Long time no see.

44:11.857 --> 44:13.692
Why aren't you coming to our gym?

44:13.776 --> 44:16.362
I've been feeling lazy these days.

44:16.445 --> 44:18.530
But I still have my muscles.
Check them out.

44:19.031 --> 44:20.240
Your biceps!

44:21.867 --> 44:23.160
Are you meeting someone?

44:23.243 --> 44:25.245
No, I'm going home. I live nearby.

44:25.329 --> 44:26.372
Oh, I see.

44:28.457 --> 44:32.670
Since we haven't met in a while,
how about we go play some games?

44:32.753 --> 44:34.254
Games? That sounds nice.

44:34.338 --> 44:37.341
Right? I know a place around here.

44:48.435 --> 44:49.353
Welcome.

44:52.856 --> 44:55.526
-This place looks nice.
-Right?

44:59.655 --> 45:01.031
Sit anywhere you'd like.

45:02.741 --> 45:03.826
Pardon?

45:05.494 --> 45:06.912
I'm Choi Jin-woo.

45:06.995 --> 45:09.289
Right. I'm Yang Do-hyeok.

45:09.373 --> 45:10.707
It's nice to meet you.

45:11.542 --> 45:14.294
GKC Entertainment was very impressed
by your social media.

45:14.878 --> 45:16.588
Thank you.

45:18.132 --> 45:19.216
And…

45:20.467 --> 45:21.969
this is an exclusive contract.

45:22.052 --> 45:23.554
Read through it.

45:24.138 --> 45:25.222
All right.

45:29.393 --> 45:31.395
Sorry, but I have to take this call.

45:31.478 --> 45:33.647
-Sure.
-Take your time.

45:48.203 --> 45:50.414
<i>Okay. I'll see you there later.</i>

45:52.958 --> 45:54.710
I'll see you later…

46:22.863 --> 46:26.241
When's your flight? I'll drive you there.

46:26.325 --> 46:29.411
No, I want to go alone.
I just came to say goodbye.

46:29.495 --> 46:31.079
Let me take you.

46:33.207 --> 46:36.043
It's fine. I don't want
that kind of vague generosity from you.

46:36.835 --> 46:38.295
I don't want to get swayed.

46:40.923 --> 46:43.008
I've decided not to pretend anymore.

46:43.091 --> 46:47.221
They say that you can't act indifferent
if you really like someone.

46:47.721 --> 46:49.515
I've realized that it's true.

46:51.350 --> 46:52.518
Sorry.

46:54.770 --> 46:56.146
It pays off to be honest.

46:56.730 --> 46:58.148
You're actually apologizing.

47:01.276 --> 47:03.445
I'll contact you if I go to the States.

47:03.529 --> 47:04.988
We can meet up.

47:07.366 --> 47:08.534
No.

47:10.577 --> 47:13.205
I'm not going to see you anymore.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.876
Having no relationship with you at all

47:18.460 --> 47:20.420
is better than being
by your side like this.

47:29.096 --> 47:30.556
Give me a last goodbye hug.

47:42.276 --> 47:43.110
Bye.

48:16.476 --> 48:17.728
Nice.

48:22.816 --> 48:24.026
Is it not going well?

48:28.071 --> 48:29.823
I should keep working on it,

48:31.199 --> 48:32.909
but my head feels blocked.

48:36.288 --> 48:38.498
But you know,
some things just work out suddenly

48:38.999 --> 48:41.793
even when you think there's no hope.

48:43.295 --> 48:45.172
I guess something good is going on.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.299
What?

48:48.008 --> 48:50.761
No, nothing's going on.

48:54.264 --> 48:55.349
I'm happy for you, Sol.

48:57.392 --> 48:59.394
Jeez, Seo Ji-wan.

49:02.189 --> 49:04.483
Ji-wan didn't tell me directly.

49:05.400 --> 49:06.693
I just realized it myself.

49:07.277 --> 49:10.113
I'm sure she was being really obvious.

49:10.197 --> 49:11.823
You were more obvious, you know.

49:13.950 --> 49:16.787
I didn't think I'd be like this.

49:19.748 --> 49:22.834
Ji-wan said you're an excellent counselor.

49:23.835 --> 49:25.879
It's easy to give advice to others,

49:27.547 --> 49:29.007
but I can't do anything myself.

49:30.217 --> 49:33.553
-Is it really over with you and Jae-eon?
-What?

49:35.263 --> 49:37.683
I thought you two made a good couple.

49:39.142 --> 49:40.268
Why?

49:41.478 --> 49:43.605
Well, it's just…

49:43.689 --> 49:47.901
Getting attracted to each other like that
already makes it special.

49:51.571 --> 49:52.906
It's a miracle.

49:54.574 --> 49:57.661
A miracle? That's what I'd say
about you and Ji-wan.

49:57.744 --> 49:59.579
It's nothing different.

49:59.663 --> 50:02.082
It's totally different for us.

50:05.752 --> 50:10.132
Maybe it was all wrong from the beginning.

50:10.966 --> 50:12.759
It just feels that way.

50:21.935 --> 50:23.437
I can't find a solution.

50:26.898 --> 50:29.234
Maybe the problem
is that you're trying to find one.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.956
<i>Excuse me. Why isn't my food coming?</i>

50:43.790 --> 50:45.333
<i>Who's going to eat it?</i>

50:45.417 --> 50:46.793
What's he on about?

50:48.587 --> 50:49.796
<i>It's all for me.</i>

50:49.880 --> 50:52.632
<i>My friend's on a strict diet,
so he only eats chicken breast.</i>

50:54.176 --> 50:57.429
<i>Well, that's a relief.
I didn't place your order yet.</i>

50:57.512 --> 50:58.930
What?

50:59.014 --> 51:00.891
You asshole.

51:04.853 --> 51:06.521
You're not picking up?

51:08.565 --> 51:10.984
What? Where did he go?

51:17.282 --> 51:18.909
OH MY SUNSHINE

51:24.790 --> 51:25.916
What is it?

51:25.999 --> 51:27.417
Why wasn't my order placed?

51:27.501 --> 51:29.294
I've been waiting so long for my food.

51:29.377 --> 51:32.005
You shouldn't eat stuff like that.
You have gastritis.

51:32.088 --> 51:33.465
It'll ruin your stomach.

51:33.548 --> 51:35.091
You and your nagging.

51:35.175 --> 51:37.302
You'll get fired
if you keep working like this.

51:37.385 --> 51:39.387
What's it to you
whether I get fired or not?

51:39.471 --> 51:42.057
Then what's it to you
whether my stomach hurts or not?

51:42.140 --> 51:43.266
Who are you to nag me?

51:47.103 --> 51:48.063
I'm your friend.

51:49.481 --> 51:52.484
Friends can worry
about each other's health.

51:58.990 --> 52:01.493
What's gotten into you?
Why are you smiling like that?

52:05.413 --> 52:07.165
"Oh My Sunshine"? That's so childish.

52:07.249 --> 52:09.876
What are you on about? Where's my phone?

52:10.460 --> 52:11.336
I already saw it.

52:12.629 --> 52:14.172
Hey, you shouldn't snoop.

52:15.715 --> 52:19.094
It didn't mean anything. I only wrote that
because your name means "shine."

52:19.177 --> 52:22.097
I just wrote your name in English.
Oh Sunshine.

52:22.681 --> 52:25.141
Never mind that.
When do you get off work today?

52:25.225 --> 52:26.226
What?

52:26.768 --> 52:28.061
Let's go on a date.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.690
This looks delicious.

52:32.232 --> 52:33.525
Why isn't Jae-eon coming?

52:35.235 --> 52:38.905
Hang on. Let's eat these
before he comes. Ta-da!

52:41.324 --> 52:42.951
I'm only giving that to you.

52:43.493 --> 52:44.870
Thanks.

52:44.953 --> 52:46.705
You know how much I like you, right?

52:53.503 --> 52:56.965
You were always late to our meetings,
but you came early today.

52:57.048 --> 52:59.175
Come on. Don't be so harsh.

52:59.676 --> 53:02.554
I'm already anxious
because Jae-eon's working so hard.

53:03.054 --> 53:06.683
You know, he's doing glass projects
because of your piece.

53:08.768 --> 53:09.978
I'm getting suspicious.

53:10.061 --> 53:12.898
There's something going on
between you two, right?

53:13.440 --> 53:15.859
Stop that nonsense. Just eat up.

53:15.942 --> 53:20.113
If it's not Jae-eon,
then is it that noodle shop guy?

53:20.697 --> 53:22.699
Ever since our workshop,

53:22.782 --> 53:26.202
we've been saying there's a higher chance
of you dating him. Is that right?

53:26.912 --> 53:30.332
-What?
-Come on. Tell me.

53:31.041 --> 53:33.460
I swear I won't tell anyone else.

53:34.669 --> 53:37.088
Why should I tell you?

53:39.382 --> 53:42.802
Jeez. Why are you suddenly
getting so upset?

53:43.511 --> 53:44.846
Hey, Jae-eon.

53:46.681 --> 53:48.475
-What took you so long?
-Sorry.

53:49.684 --> 53:52.979
Since you're here now, let's drink.

53:53.939 --> 53:54.814
Here you go.

53:55.857 --> 53:57.984
You too. Here.

54:05.408 --> 54:07.077
Cheers!

54:19.631 --> 54:21.883
The weather is pretty nice.

54:25.929 --> 54:27.430
Oh, right!

54:34.062 --> 54:37.774
This is what I ordered
to your house last time.

54:38.775 --> 54:40.110
They're matching keyrings.

54:40.652 --> 54:43.196
It's like a heart lock and key.

54:43.697 --> 54:45.824
I got these
because they're a limited edition.

54:45.907 --> 54:48.410
I had no idea we would break up
before I gave it to you.

54:50.620 --> 54:51.705
Aren't they pretty?

54:53.581 --> 54:55.166
Yes. They're pretty.

54:58.253 --> 55:01.840
So what's going to happen between us now?

55:01.923 --> 55:03.383
-Us?
-Yes.

55:06.344 --> 55:07.470
Well…

55:08.179 --> 55:09.556
I…

55:10.473 --> 55:13.476
Do I have to say this out loud?

55:13.560 --> 55:15.520
You need to talk for me to understand.

55:20.567 --> 55:22.068
Give me your hand.

55:26.072 --> 55:28.241
Let's start dating again.

55:29.075 --> 55:32.579
Be my boyfriend again.
I'll really be good to you.

55:33.913 --> 55:36.541
It was all my fault.
I promise I won't do that again.

55:36.624 --> 55:39.044
I'll do my best. I'll change.

55:39.711 --> 55:42.338
Can't you be serious for a single second?

55:42.422 --> 55:46.134
Hey. You're always serious.
If I become serious too,

55:46.217 --> 55:48.595
then there won't be
any chemistry between us.

55:50.597 --> 55:51.806
-You're right.
-Right?

55:55.101 --> 55:56.102
What…

56:01.649 --> 56:04.277
-Thank you.
-Thank you too.

56:08.490 --> 56:10.575
I missed this smell.

56:14.162 --> 56:15.038
Are you a pervert?

56:15.121 --> 56:17.624
How can you say that to your sunshine?

56:20.293 --> 56:21.878
I missed you too.

56:23.129 --> 56:24.964
Let's go on a lot of dates from now on.

56:25.048 --> 56:27.342
We can go to theaters, amusement parks,

56:27.425 --> 56:28.885
beaches, and mountains.

56:28.968 --> 56:29.928
All right.

56:31.221 --> 56:34.599
I'll try being abstinent just for you.

56:34.682 --> 56:36.935
What? Abstinent?

56:37.018 --> 56:39.062
I'll do my best. I mean it.

56:39.145 --> 56:41.815
You don't need to go that far. I mean…

56:44.109 --> 56:46.194
I'm a man, you know, and…

56:47.946 --> 56:49.155
I like it too.

56:49.739 --> 56:52.117
You like what? Be more specific.

56:55.370 --> 56:57.455
Do I really have to say that out loud?

56:57.539 --> 56:59.165
You just said I needed to!

56:59.249 --> 57:01.668
You're not sticking to your word.

57:01.751 --> 57:03.253
-No…
-What do you mean?

57:03.336 --> 57:04.379
You know what I mean.

57:04.462 --> 57:07.132
How would I know?
Hey, don't talk like that.

57:10.135 --> 57:11.177
What?

57:11.928 --> 57:14.305
Are you calling me small? I'm pretty tall!

57:28.278 --> 57:29.571
Don't worry, Mom.

57:30.947 --> 57:34.409
All right. Tell Dad I'll call him later.

57:34.492 --> 57:35.827
I should really get going.

57:36.411 --> 57:38.246
I'll call you when I arrive.

58:10.653 --> 58:11.696
Hey, Do-hyeok.

58:12.864 --> 58:14.449
Yes, I'm heading out now.

58:14.532 --> 58:17.118
No, you don't need to come.
I can just take a cab.

58:17.785 --> 58:20.497
Okay. I'll be there soon.

58:34.719 --> 58:35.720
Do-hyeok!

58:36.387 --> 58:38.097
-Hey.
-I brought coffee…

58:49.943 --> 58:50.944
Oh, right.

58:55.490 --> 58:57.867
-What's this?
-I got them printed.

58:58.451 --> 58:59.619
-The photos?
-Yes.

59:00.745 --> 59:02.038
Gosh!

59:03.206 --> 59:05.458
I can't believe
you got them printed like this.

59:09.671 --> 59:11.339
You're really good at taking photos.

59:11.923 --> 59:12.757
How about cooking?

59:13.341 --> 59:15.051
Your cooking is a bit…

59:20.014 --> 59:22.517
The weather was amazing.

59:23.101 --> 59:24.394
And here.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.730
-What's this?
-It's going to rain later.

59:28.982 --> 59:30.191
-Today?
-Yes.

59:32.026 --> 59:34.487
It doesn't look like it'll rain at all.

59:34.571 --> 59:37.198
Use that if it rains. I have another one.

59:39.450 --> 59:40.868
All right. Thanks.

59:44.998 --> 59:46.666
So did the meeting go well?

59:46.749 --> 59:48.376
Yes. It was okay.

59:48.459 --> 59:51.588
We're meeting again
after revising the contract a little.

59:52.297 --> 59:53.506
A contract?

59:54.090 --> 59:56.259
Then you're going to have an agency?

59:56.342 --> 59:58.678
I don't know much about it yet, though.

1:00:00.179 --> 1:00:03.266
Your new video got a lot of views too.

1:00:03.349 --> 1:00:05.059
It's all thanks to you.

1:00:05.685 --> 1:00:06.811
Thanks.

1:00:06.894 --> 1:00:09.856
I told you, it's not me. It's all you.

1:00:09.939 --> 1:00:13.067
I only thought of doing it
since you gave me all that advice.

1:00:13.151 --> 1:00:14.235
That's why.

1:00:18.990 --> 1:00:21.909
Thanks for saying that.

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:28.333
The day we met at your school,

1:00:28.916 --> 1:00:32.837
I went to your house at night
to give you the photos.

1:00:33.463 --> 1:00:36.883
Oh, really? Why didn't you say anything?

1:00:36.966 --> 1:00:38.968
I saw you and Jae-eon

1:00:40.094 --> 1:00:42.513
going into your house together.

1:00:47.602 --> 1:00:50.730
I know I said I could wait for you
as long as it takes.

1:00:54.359 --> 1:00:56.402
But I felt so jealous.

1:01:02.241 --> 1:01:03.201
Do-hyeok.

1:01:03.993 --> 1:01:08.414
Na-bi. I really wish you were happy.

1:01:10.041 --> 1:01:11.584
But Park Jae-eon…

1:01:18.257 --> 1:01:23.346
Have you felt, even once,
that he sincerely likes you?

1:02:45.636 --> 1:02:46.763
Jae-eon?

1:02:47.346 --> 1:02:48.306
Why are you here?

1:02:50.558 --> 1:02:51.559
Hey.

1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:54.479
Why are you home so late?

1:02:54.562 --> 1:02:56.481
Were you with Do-hyeok this whole time?

1:02:57.064 --> 1:02:58.566
Are you drunk?

1:02:58.649 --> 1:03:00.610
And it's none of your business.

1:03:01.319 --> 1:03:02.945
How cold.

1:03:04.113 --> 1:03:08.201
Am I boring to you
since you have someone else now?

1:03:09.285 --> 1:03:11.454
Let's talk again when you're sober.

1:03:18.169 --> 1:03:22.215
Does he still like you
even after seeing us

1:03:22.298 --> 1:03:23.382
entering your house?

1:03:24.842 --> 1:03:26.010
What?

1:03:27.345 --> 1:03:28.304
Incredible.

1:03:28.805 --> 1:03:31.849
Is that why you choose him instead of me?

1:03:35.561 --> 1:03:38.064
You knew that Do-hyeok was here that day?

1:03:38.147 --> 1:03:39.774
Did you know too?

1:03:42.235 --> 1:03:44.946
So you're saying
you saw Do-hyeok here that day?

1:03:45.530 --> 1:03:46.572
Yes.

1:03:48.115 --> 1:03:50.201
You should have seen his face.

1:03:50.284 --> 1:03:52.328
It seemed like he'd burst into tears.

1:03:52.411 --> 1:03:54.205
Why didn't you tell me?

1:03:54.789 --> 1:03:55.957
Why would I do that?

1:03:56.833 --> 1:04:00.586
Oh, right. You said
you didn't want to disappoint him.

1:04:02.338 --> 1:04:05.049
Then should I have told you
to explain things to him?

1:04:05.132 --> 1:04:08.761
But it's true
that we had a relationship like that.

1:04:14.392 --> 1:04:15.601
Have you lost your mind?

1:04:15.685 --> 1:04:17.228
You shouldn't get angry at me.

1:04:17.311 --> 1:04:19.814
I'm just telling the truth like you did.

1:04:31.909 --> 1:04:34.745
Is that why you asked me out?

1:04:35.329 --> 1:04:36.789
Isn't that what you wanted?

1:04:39.959 --> 1:04:43.713
Oh, I guess
that's not what you wanted from me.

1:04:44.714 --> 1:04:46.591
And you say you really like me?

1:04:47.174 --> 1:04:48.050
That's nonsense.

1:04:48.134 --> 1:04:50.219
What about you?
Why did you say that to Seol-a?

1:04:50.303 --> 1:04:53.055
Was that just to screw me over?
It wasn't, right?

1:04:53.139 --> 1:04:56.517
It was. I just did that to screw you over.

1:04:56.601 --> 1:04:58.978
You were leading me on
but saying I was a friend,

1:04:59.061 --> 1:05:02.523
then I found out you had a girlfriend.
I did it because you were a jerk.

1:05:03.190 --> 1:05:04.150
Hey.

1:05:05.109 --> 1:05:06.569
So am I the only jerk here?

1:05:07.987 --> 1:05:08.821
Do you regret it?

1:05:10.990 --> 1:05:12.116
Do you regret

1:05:13.576 --> 1:05:14.619
what we did?

1:05:19.206 --> 1:05:20.166
Yes.

1:05:21.959 --> 1:05:23.044
I regret it.

1:05:26.172 --> 1:05:29.634
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we did.

1:05:31.761 --> 1:05:33.596
But I won't blame you.

1:05:34.472 --> 1:05:35.598
I brought it on myself.

1:05:37.099 --> 1:05:40.519
I knew there was no happy ending for us,

1:05:40.603 --> 1:05:44.482
but I was an idiot for getting my hopes up
and thinking you could be sincere.

1:05:47.985 --> 1:05:51.072
You told me that I had
the right to decide our relationship.

1:05:54.116 --> 1:05:56.160
I don't want to see you ever again.

1:07:23.998 --> 1:07:25.249
<i>I lost</i>

1:07:27.293 --> 1:07:28.502
<i>Na-bi…</i>

1:07:29.962 --> 1:07:30.963
<i>for good.</i>

1:08:16.759 --> 1:08:18.469
<i>Hey, Na-bi!</i>

1:08:18.552 --> 1:08:21.472
<i>It feels like I'm having terrible,
recurring nightmares.</i>

1:08:21.555 --> 1:08:23.057
Let's fix this.

1:08:23.140 --> 1:08:25.392
<i>You look the happiest
when you're working on your pieces.</i>

1:08:25.476 --> 1:08:26.393
And the prettiest.

1:08:26.977 --> 1:08:29.313
<i>-I'm excited to see it.
-But can you come?</i>

1:08:29.396 --> 1:08:30.856
<i>Don't strain yourself.</i>

1:08:30.940 --> 1:08:33.734
No, I have to make it.
It's your exhibition.

1:08:34.318 --> 1:08:38.906
<i>How can I define the feelings
I have left for Jae-eon?</i>

1:08:38.989 --> 1:08:40.699
<i>-Na-bi.
-If you decided to be a jerk,</i>

1:08:40.783 --> 1:08:42.451
<i>you should've stayed that way.
Why are you here like this?</i>

1:08:42.535 --> 1:08:44.036
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:46.247
<i>I'll stay away from you. I promise.</i>

1:08:46.330 --> 1:08:50.501
<i>Lingering affection? Regret? Hate? Or…</i>

1:08:50.584 --> 1:08:52.503
Do I still have a chance with you?

1:08:53.254 --> 1:08:54.296
Please accept this.

1:08:57.800 --> 1:09:02.429
