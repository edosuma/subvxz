WEBVTT

00:05.038 --> 00:06.439
Somebody just walked
over my grave.

00:06.506 --> 00:07.907
-Where is she?
-I don't know
who you're talking about.

00:07.974 --> 00:10.076
-Sarah Jane Smith.
-Never heard of her.

00:10.143 --> 00:12.846
-Get out of my house!
-This isn't your house!

00:12.912 --> 00:14.914
-Get out!
-I'm going to sort things out.

00:14.981 --> 00:17.083
I'm going to work out
how time got changed.

00:17.150 --> 00:20.720
<i>I'm going to find Sarah Jane,</i>
<i>and then I'm going</i>
<i>to bring her back!</i>

00:20.787 --> 00:23.957
-There's a huge meteor
heading for Earth.
-Oh, is there now?

00:24.023 --> 00:26.025
Only Sarah Jane can stop it
and she's vanished!

00:39.572 --> 00:41.875
Pleased to meet you, Maria,
I'm Sarah Jane Smith.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.446
And you're Andrea Yates?

00:46.513 --> 00:49.149
So what if I am?
I don't know you,
how come you know me?

00:55.021 --> 00:57.090
July 13th, 1964.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.626
I've gone back in time.

00:59.692 --> 01:02.662
-Sarah Jane.
I will know you.
-She's a loony.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.763
Come on, leave her alone.
They don't know
their own strength.

01:04.831 --> 01:08.168
Don't be so mean.
If you're lost, I'll take you
to our teacher.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.970
(SIGHS) We're not going back,
it's boring.

01:11.037 --> 01:13.373
And you're going
down the pier?
Right now?

01:13.440 --> 01:16.409
Oh, it's closed off,
but we'll get through.
I want to explore.

01:16.476 --> 01:18.111
-But you mustn't!
-What?

01:18.178 --> 01:20.246
Sarah Jane,
you've got to believe me.

01:20.313 --> 01:23.383
-You mustn't go down there!
-Why not?

01:23.450 --> 01:25.752
July 13th, 1964.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.621
It's today, the accident,
it's about to happen.

01:28.688 --> 01:31.791
Look, I shouldn't be here,
but I was travelling
with this thing.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.194
It's too complicated
to explain, but I broke free,

01:34.260 --> 01:38.364
and I must've ended up here
'cause this was the last place
he came to.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.668
Because he was here
in 1964.

01:41.734 --> 01:44.003
He must've been,
he swapped you two over.

01:44.070 --> 01:45.772
Hang on, slow down.
I'm not getting any of this.

01:45.839 --> 01:49.943
-There's nothing to get.
She's creepy.
-Just listen to me!

01:50.009 --> 01:52.679
It's not safe!
Go back, both of you.

01:52.745 --> 01:56.282
Find your mates, just get back
on the coach to school,
go home!

01:56.349 --> 01:58.852
I told you she was mad.
Come on, leave her!

02:00.653 --> 02:01.921
(GRASKE LAUGHS)

02:07.794 --> 02:10.229
-Where'd she go?
-Who cares? What a creep.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.566
SARAH JANE:
She said we shouldn't.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.635
Sarah Jane, don't be so dull!

02:15.702 --> 02:16.936
But she was scared.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.708
It's weird.
I sort of believed her.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.611
Yeah. You'd believe
a Triffid's gonna come
and get us!

02:24.677 --> 02:26.880
Just follow me,
I'll look after you.

02:33.186 --> 02:34.053
(ROARS)

02:42.128 --> 02:44.797
-Where is this?
-SARAH JANE: You tell me.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.935
MARIA: Oh! (LAUGHS)

02:49.135 --> 02:52.572
-I thought I'd never
see you again!
-Oh, it's so good to see you.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.140
I was all on my own.

02:56.309 --> 02:59.879
Where are we?
Is this a different planet?

02:59.946 --> 03:02.549
I don't think
we're anywhere at all.

03:02.615 --> 03:04.484
We're in limbo.

03:04.551 --> 03:06.719
MARIA: What does that mean?

03:06.786 --> 03:09.789
It's nowhere.
It's nothing, Maria.

03:10.423 --> 03:11.591
We're lost.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.962
But you came here earlier
to see her.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.331
It's our own daughter,
Chrissie, she's disappeared.

03:18.398 --> 03:21.834
-This isn't funny, Alan.
We never had any kids.
-But...

03:21.901 --> 03:26.072
She's about that high,
and she's got dark hair,
like me. She's beautiful...

03:26.139 --> 03:28.141
Are you getting
a kick out of this?

03:28.207 --> 03:32.111
There is no Maria!
This is cruel, now, stop it!

03:32.178 --> 03:34.914
Maybe if there had been,
we wouldn't have split up.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.749
But it's too late
for that now.

03:38.751 --> 03:40.253
It's this box.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.856
Oh, you're full of nonsense,
you are.

03:43.923 --> 03:47.160
Right, you stay here,
I'm going to go to
Andrea's birthday party,

03:47.226 --> 03:50.830
although she's actually
real flesh and blood, Alan,
so probably not your type.

03:51.598 --> 03:52.665
Oh!

03:54.934 --> 03:58.204
You should make this
into a utility room,
I know I keep saying it.

03:58.271 --> 04:00.173
-This was her bedroom.
-Oh, Alan, stop it!

04:00.239 --> 04:02.642
She said she was protected,
something protected her.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.243
What if this protected her?

04:04.310 --> 04:07.113
If we've got a daughter,
then where is she? Look.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.883
This is the day you moved in.
Andrea came to help,
I took the photo.

04:10.950 --> 04:15.188
You, and her, and me.
No one called Maria.

04:15.254 --> 04:18.524
-Maria was telling the truth!
-Oh!

04:18.591 --> 04:22.428
This is why!
People say, "He's gorgeous,
why did you split?"

04:22.495 --> 04:25.431
This just brings it
all flooding back!

04:25.498 --> 04:27.700
What if there's meant
to be a Maria

04:27.767 --> 04:29.869
and someone else?

04:29.936 --> 04:32.639
A woman called
Sarah Jane Smith.

04:34.273 --> 04:35.508
Andrea Yates.

04:36.509 --> 04:39.245
Oh, I could never forget.

04:39.312 --> 04:42.882
When I was 13,
we were on a school trip.
We went on to the pier.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.319
She fell and
there was nothing I could do.

04:46.386 --> 04:50.323
I always thought
that could have been me.

04:50.390 --> 04:53.826
But now she's alive,
like she's always been alive.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.128
What sort of woman is she?

04:56.462 --> 04:58.531
Bit full on, life's a party.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.866
Yeah, that sounds like her.

05:01.367 --> 05:05.972
So in the parallel world,
you died and she lived.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.608
It's not a parallel world.
If only.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.277
It's our timeline
that's been changed.

05:11.344 --> 05:14.847
But without you, that meteor
must still be on its way,

05:14.914 --> 05:16.949
it's gonna smash
into the Earth.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.685
If I'm not there,

05:19.719 --> 05:21.454
that means the end
of the world.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.857
I was the only one
that knew about it.
I got protected, somehow.

05:26.559 --> 05:28.661
-By that box.
-The box!

05:28.728 --> 05:31.364
The Verron soothsayer
must have known
this was going to happen.

05:31.431 --> 05:32.965
Remember what I told you?

05:33.032 --> 05:34.767
He said,
"Give it to the person
you trust the most".

05:34.834 --> 05:36.836
It linked us somehow,
I could sense you
searching for me.

05:36.903 --> 05:37.904
I called out to you.

05:40.039 --> 05:42.475
But I dropped it, I lost it.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.111
That little alien thing
came along and I ran.

05:45.178 --> 05:49.315
-Did he do all this?
-No. That alien,
he's called a Graske.

05:49.382 --> 05:52.351
There was some
Graske activity on Earth
a couple of years back,

05:52.418 --> 05:55.688
but this isn't their
style at all.

05:55.755 --> 05:58.858
-What do you mean?
-This is much more powerful.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.963
Some other creature must be
using the Graske as a slave.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.233
-TRICKSTER: <i>Sarah Jane.</i>
-Who's that?

06:07.300 --> 06:11.003
-<i> Sarah Jane.</i>
-I'm being summoned.

06:11.070 --> 06:13.773
-Maria, you stay here.
-Don't leave me on my own!

06:13.840 --> 06:17.877
Oh, I'll come back. I promise.
Oh, I'd never leave you,
Maria, never. You got that?

06:19.011 --> 06:20.646
Just wait.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.149
TRICKSTER: <i>Sarah Jane.</i>

06:28.387 --> 06:31.290
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Thank you for inviting us.

06:31.357 --> 06:32.992
Wouldn't be the same
without you,
go and find a drink.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.329
Hello, Joan!
How are you, love?
Go and find a drink.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.464
Den, lovely to see you.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.204
(LOUD BANG)

06:45.905 --> 06:47.607
(DISEMBODIED VOICES)

06:49.575 --> 06:51.811
I take it this is your domain.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.247
-SARAH JANE: Who are you?
-Nobody.

06:54.313 --> 06:55.581
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

06:55.648 --> 06:57.717
I am nothing.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.453
Any chance you could
be a bit less cryptic?

07:00.520 --> 07:03.689
It's hard for me
to make you understand.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.859
Ephemeral minds
are so limited.

07:09.328 --> 07:10.429
Behold...

07:12.865 --> 07:15.935
As you can see,
I have no self.

07:16.135 --> 07:18.571
I exist
only to bring disorder.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.107
-That is my purpose.
-But why?

07:21.174 --> 07:24.443
Chaos is my blood,

07:24.510 --> 07:27.647
and air and food.

07:28.714 --> 07:31.984
You are the key to that chaos.

07:32.051 --> 07:36.155
I have been waiting,
searching through time

07:36.222 --> 07:40.626
for just the right person
at just the right moment.

07:40.693 --> 07:44.764
I took you to aid
the coming of darkness.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.233
Where's Luke? Where is my son?

07:47.300 --> 07:52.839
The Bane never came
to Earth in the timeline
that I have created.

07:52.905 --> 07:56.843
Luke Smith never existed.

07:56.909 --> 07:58.411
People who don't exist,
they end up here.

07:58.477 --> 08:00.746
Don't they?
In this Nowhere Land.
So where is he?

08:00.813 --> 08:02.715
I demand to see my son!

08:02.782 --> 08:06.052
He is lost,
in the forgotten places,

08:06.953 --> 08:09.355
even further out than you.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.991
But if I died,
all those years ago...

08:12.058 --> 08:14.861
Never mind the Bane,
what about the Slitheen?

08:14.927 --> 08:17.463
And the Gorgons?
And the Patriarchs
of the Tin Vagabond?

08:17.530 --> 08:20.366
I stopped them all
from taking over Earth.
What happened to them?

08:20.433 --> 08:24.804
I turned them all away.
All I need is the meteor.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.839
Why, what's so special
about that?

08:26.906 --> 08:28.674
TRICKSTER:
Those other species,

08:28.741 --> 08:33.246
they invade for profit,
power, revenge.

08:33.312 --> 08:35.581
The meteor is pure chaos.

08:35.648 --> 08:39.385
The destruction of the Earth,
for no reason at all.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.888
Just blind chance.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.524
This is food for me.

08:45.591 --> 08:49.795
You'll destroy
all life on Earth
and you don't even care?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.797
TRICKSTER: I care about you.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.936
You are so wonderful,
Sarah Jane Smith.

08:58.337 --> 09:00.306
Your life was so important

09:00.373 --> 09:04.877
and I found the right moment
to snuff it out,

09:04.944 --> 09:08.247
with the help of Andrea Yates.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.548
Andrea was my friend.

09:09.615 --> 09:12.051
She wished
to save her own life.

09:12.118 --> 09:15.521
I could only remove you
with her consent.

09:15.588 --> 09:16.756
She agreed to...

09:17.757 --> 09:19.225
TRICKSTER: I must go now.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.228
Events are moving
towards their end.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.462
No! Don't go.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.765
I will return when the Earth
is no more.

09:25.831 --> 09:28.868
And I will explore
your potential further.

09:28.935 --> 09:31.103
In particular,

09:31.170 --> 09:34.006
your memories of this,
"Doctor".

09:35.107 --> 09:36.542
You leave him alone!

09:36.609 --> 09:38.711
I can use you to find him.

09:38.778 --> 09:42.648
Imagine, if the Doctor
had never existed,

09:42.715 --> 09:46.652
what chaos there would be
across the stars?

09:46.719 --> 09:48.421
Don't you dare!

09:48.487 --> 09:52.358
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare!

09:52.425 --> 09:54.827
-(CORK POPPING)
-(RETRO MUSIC PLAYING)

09:54.894 --> 09:56.829
(EXCLAIMING)
Oh, that's lovely!

09:56.896 --> 09:59.665
Oh, tell your mum thanks.
I'm sorry she couldn't
make it.

09:59.732 --> 10:02.501
-Right, I'll be off then.
-No, no, stick around.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.937
Here, have a bit of cake.

10:05.137 --> 10:07.506
Okay, no complaints from me!

10:09.942 --> 10:12.144
ANDREA: Well, look who's here!

10:12.211 --> 10:15.381
Hello, love, welcome, welcome.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.451
Oh, Alan,
still not found anyone?

10:18.517 --> 10:20.720
He is mine.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.990
More gorgeous every day.
If I was only
a few years younger...

10:24.056 --> 10:25.825
Oh! You can have him!

10:26.792 --> 10:27.960
CHRISSIE: Hello, you!

10:28.027 --> 10:30.796
What's the matter, Alan,
cat got your tongue?

10:30.863 --> 10:31.864
You could say that.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.870
Oh, Clyde, don't put that
modern stuff on, let it play.

10:37.937 --> 10:39.372
CLYDE: This stuff's ancient.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.942
Not to me, it isn't.

10:43.009 --> 10:47.880
It's like yesterday.
Oh, the '60s.
That was my time.

10:47.947 --> 10:49.849
I was just a kid back then.

10:55.021 --> 10:57.690
-You okay?
-I heard what it said.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.726
And the meteor's coming.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.762
We can't do anything.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.931
There must be something.
There's always something.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.904
-My dad.
-What can he do?
He didn't remember me.

11:11.971 --> 11:15.608
Now you've been
taken out of time,
he won't remember you, either.

11:23.582 --> 11:24.850
CLYDE: You what?

11:25.851 --> 11:28.154
Danny, are you serious?

11:28.220 --> 11:29.855
All right,
I'll check it out.

11:34.593 --> 11:36.595
Oh, Clyde, not again.

11:36.662 --> 11:38.764
It's my mate Danny.
He said there's something
big on the news.

11:38.831 --> 11:40.399
Can we turn on the tele?

11:40.466 --> 11:43.969
You kids and your TV,
it's meant to be a party!

11:44.036 --> 11:46.372

23:41.586 --> 23:43.922
He's lost out there, Andrea,
somewhere terrible.

23:43.989 --> 23:45.991
And I am begging you.
Please save him.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.730
If I do, what happens
to my life?

23:53.498 --> 23:55.500
All the things I did
as I grew up?

23:57.135 --> 23:58.870
They get scrubbed out?

24:00.138 --> 24:02.274
I get forgotten?

24:02.340 --> 24:05.811
No, you were never forgotten,
never.

24:05.877 --> 24:09.881
What I saw that day,
it changed me forever.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.551
I saw how precious life is.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.554
And it made me fight
to defend it
across all these years.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.756
Because of you, Andrea.

24:17.823 --> 24:19.724
It was all because of you.

24:19.791 --> 24:20.859
My best friend.

24:21.827 --> 24:23.195
(EERIE ROAR)

24:23.261 --> 24:25.363
Is that him? The Trickster?

24:25.430 --> 24:27.799
Dad, no! Don't go near him.

24:27.866 --> 24:30.235
TRICKSTER: Andrea Yates.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.904
They want to
kill you all over again.

24:33.872 --> 24:35.874
Remember your bargain with me.

24:38.376 --> 24:39.878
You tricked me!

24:40.745 --> 24:43.315
You used a child.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.951
And now
you're destroying the Earth!

24:46.017 --> 24:49.254
Chaos is good.

24:49.454 --> 24:50.922
Well, I say, no.

24:52.224 --> 24:53.959
If there's one thing
I can do with my life,

24:54.025 --> 24:56.328
I can put a stop to you
for good.

24:56.394 --> 24:58.129
I've changed my mind!

24:58.196 --> 24:59.764
I'm taking the deal back!

24:59.831 --> 25:03.268
Then you will die.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.871
I've been dead for 40 years.

25:13.578 --> 25:14.913
It's been a good life.

25:17.649 --> 25:19.451
It's my birthday.

25:21.419 --> 25:22.487
Bye, Sarah Jane.

25:23.922 --> 25:25.390
I'm going now.

25:26.992 --> 25:29.127
And you're free!

25:30.629 --> 25:33.999
Andrea! Grab my hand!
Grab my hand!

25:34.065 --> 25:35.533
Grab my hand, Andrea!

25:36.234 --> 25:37.135
Remember me.

25:39.304 --> 25:40.872
-(ANDREA SCREAMS)
-No!

25:43.775 --> 25:45.110
(RUMBLING CONTINUES)

25:45.176 --> 25:46.945
I'm back.

25:47.012 --> 25:49.047
We're back, all of us!

25:49.114 --> 25:50.982
Back where we belong!

25:51.049 --> 25:53.485
That felt like
a spatio-temporal shift caused
by extra-quantum forces.

25:53.551 --> 25:54.753
(MARIA LAUGHING)

25:54.819 --> 25:57.622
-In English?
-Oh, it's all back to normal!

25:57.689 --> 25:58.823
(RUMBLING)

25:58.890 --> 26:00.759
-The meteor!
-It's still coming!

26:00.825 --> 26:03.261
Sarah Jane, do something!

26:03.328 --> 26:04.629
LUKE: Thirty seconds
to impact.

26:04.696 --> 26:07.399
Mr Smith, I need you!

26:07.465 --> 26:09.868
-MR SMITH: <i>Emergency</i>
<i>measures required.</i>
-I know!

26:09.935 --> 26:12.270
Luke, steady
the magnetic buffer.

26:12.337 --> 26:13.772
-Done!
-Come on!

26:13.838 --> 26:16.141
Right, Mr Smith. Activate.

26:16.207 --> 26:17.609
(STARTING UP)

26:20.545 --> 26:21.846
(HIGH-PITCHED SIGNAL)

26:27.819 --> 26:28.853
(CHRISSIE SCREAMS)

26:32.557 --> 26:34.259
She did it!

26:34.326 --> 26:35.460
She did it!

26:37.329 --> 26:39.831
Oh, like Bobby Sue
had anything to do with that.

26:39.898 --> 26:43.001
You'll be telling me
she invented
the zip fastener next.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.403
(CHEERING)

26:45.470 --> 26:48.473
-MR SMITH: <i>Meteor K67</i>
<i>has been deflected.</i>
-We did it!

26:48.540 --> 26:50.608
Never mind that,
you're back!

26:50.675 --> 26:52.610
Was I away?

26:52.677 --> 26:55.914
And you are never, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever,
ever going away again!

26:55.981 --> 26:59.784
-LUKE: What just happened?
-A friend of mine
just saved the world.

26:59.851 --> 27:02.988
Her name was Andrea Yates.

27:03.054 --> 27:05.857
Oh, that was brilliant,
we did it!
You should've seen it! It...

27:07.926 --> 27:09.094
What's he doing here?

27:10.261 --> 27:11.363
ALAN: Right.

27:11.429 --> 27:13.798
Aliens, monsters,
supercomputers.

27:13.865 --> 27:15.767
Is anybody going to tell me
what's going on?

27:16.634 --> 27:18.103
ALAN: Hmm?

27:18.169 --> 27:19.871
Come on. I need some answers.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.674
Who's going first?

27:28.446 --> 27:31.016
It's been five months
since we saw Ashley.

27:32.851 --> 27:35.920
Mr Smith, I need you,
more than ever.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.689
CHRISSIE: I told you time
and time again,

27:37.756 --> 27:39.090
there's something wrong
with that woman.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.259
Ashley, Oh, my God!

27:41.326 --> 27:43.328
-SARAH JANE: <i>I wish</i>
<i>I had all the answers.</i>
-No!

27:43.395 --> 27:45.797
MARIA: <i>We're part</i>
<i>of something so much bigger</i>
<i>than living here,</i>

27:45.864 --> 27:47.298
<i>on Bannerman Road.</i>

27:47.365 --> 27:49.801
MAN: It seems you've got
powerful friends, Miss Smith.

27:49.868 --> 27:52.871
I told you when we met.
My life is dangerous.

27:52.937 --> 27:54.506
ALAN:
This is serious stuff, Maria.

27:54.572 --> 27:55.707
Crazy, but serious.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.109
MARIA: <i>Dad says we're moving!</i>

27:58.176 --> 28:00.445
He says I can't have anything
to do with you any more.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.847
SARAH JANE: <i>Sometimes</i>
<i>it's the only way to survive.</i>
