00:03.960 --> 00:07.487
I love you. Look me in the eye and tell
me you don't feel something for him.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.007
- What are you doing with him?
- I'm going to remake him.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.329
The vampire to end all vampires.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.642
There's a reason Esther used me
to make you.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.640
She didn't want you to be immortal.
She tied your life to a human one. Mine.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.167
I was the one who created
your vampire bloodline.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.203
I am responsible for your lives.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.771
I want to desiccate him.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.086
Tyler.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.164
We'll call you from the road...

00:36.320 --> 00:39.130
after we've dumped Klaus' body
in the Atlantic.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.526
<i>I'm gonna show you tonight</i>

00:55.840 --> 00:57.649
<i>I'm all right I'm all right</i>

00:57.800 --> 00:59.404
<i>I'm just fine</i>

00:59.640 --> 01:01.085
<i>And you're a tool</i>

01:01.240 --> 01:03.368
<i>So, so what?</i>

01:03.520 --> 01:05.170
<i>I am a rock star</i>

01:05.319 --> 01:07.129
<i>I got my rock moves</i>

01:07.280 --> 01:10.568
<i>And I don't want you tonight</i>

01:15.440 --> 01:17.169
Ba-da-da-da-da-da

01:20.640 --> 01:21.721
Hey.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.008
Jeremy locked himself
in the bathroom again.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.242
Does he think we don't know
what he's doing?

01:26.400 --> 01:28.243
He's 14. They don't think.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.922
- Hey. You'll get me in
trouble with your... Morning.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.488
- Morning, Mom.
- Heh, heh.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.365
<i>She's gonna be fine.</i>

01:57.840 --> 01:59.968
She got a little banged up today.
Hit her head.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.964
It was just a slight concussion.
Nothing to worry about.

02:03.120 --> 02:07.330
- But she collapsed. There was blood.
- Honestly, Jeremy, she's okay.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.249
She's just...

02:09.440 --> 02:11.568
She's been through a lot.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.569
Is there anyone you want to call?

02:18.120 --> 02:19.246
You did what?

02:19.440 --> 02:21.169
Took her to hospital.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.687
When you find your sister unconscious,
you call 911.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.162
Not when you have a parade
of vampires at your disposal.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.166
Every remaining Original is gonna want
Elena dead. She's a sitting duck there.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.368
Meredith wants to keep her
for observation.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.842
Jeremy, get Elena home.
We're on our way.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.760
Have I told you lately
how much I appreciate you...

02:41.920 --> 02:43.922
not being the dumbest
brother on Earth?

02:47.400 --> 02:50.210
You know one of us
needs to keep moving, right?

02:50.360 --> 02:53.603
If Klaus really is the sire
of our bloodline...

02:53.760 --> 02:57.287
we need to keep his body hidden
before Alaric finds him, kills him...

02:57.440 --> 02:58.805
and we all end up dead.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.007
Our life
is one big proverbial coin toss.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.967
Hello, Meredith.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.441
- What are you doing here?
- I'm Elena's guardian.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.967
Thought it was strange
I didn't get a phone call.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.408
- How did you find out?
- I have eyes and ears everywhere now.

03:22.560 --> 03:27.009
Funny, the people of this town are good
at their jobs when you allow them to be.

03:27.160 --> 03:33.566
Speaking of, you are a little too good
at your job.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.610
But that's because you cheat.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.446
So I found your stash
of vampire blood.

03:44.400 --> 03:48.166
- Don't. Stop it. Don't do that. Stop it!
- The Council will be in touch...

03:48.320 --> 03:51.051
with the medical board
to have your license suspended.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.568
Mayor Lockwood and Sheriff Forbes
are being relieved of their duties.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.367
I'm getting this town
back under control.

03:58.520 --> 04:02.969
And you will be releasing Elena
into my custody.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.249
- Couch.
- I'm fine.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.563
- I want something to eat.
- We're on it. As soon as we make sure...

04:28.720 --> 04:31.564
- ...no one's lurking in the closets.
- All right. Couch. Now.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.485
Oh, I told you, I'm fine.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.723
Doctor says rest, you rest.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.886
Now, what can I get you?
Do you want some tea?

04:43.040 --> 04:44.804
Maybe some vodka?

04:44.960 --> 04:46.371
Both will help you sleep.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.169
I know.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.767
Being smothering, it's what I do.

04:59.960 --> 05:03.601
No. It's nice.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.971
- I'm thinking maybe tea with vodka, heh.
- Heh.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.928
Caroline Forbes told me that
my ponytail lacked zhuzh.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.764
Heh, I don't know what that means.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.844
Means Caroline's driving Elena crazy,
as usual.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.288
So as I psychically predicted,
flare jeans are making a comeback.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.289
That doesn't make you psychic,
Bonnie.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.528
It means that you watch
too much Top Model.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.287
Say what you want, but I have a bad
feeling about the bonfire tonight.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.807
It doesn't matter because I can't go.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.769
I know. But Jenna's in town
and my parents want to do family night.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.606
You have to go.
See if you can sneak out.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.810
Gotta see Coach Tanner. Love you.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.530
You didn't say it back.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.927
- What?
- You know what.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.848
You can't string him along, Elena.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.482
If you're not into it anymore,
just tell him.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.891
Where is everyone?

06:26.680 --> 06:30.605
Tyler and Caroline got a call from their
moms. What were you dreaming about?

06:33.320 --> 06:34.481
Sophomore year.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.243
Seems like forever ago.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.051
Heh, mm-hm, it was.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.482
I'm sorry that I strung you along.

06:49.120 --> 06:54.411
I should have figured out what I wanted
and just been honest about it.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.444
And now I'm making the same mistakes
with Stefan and Damon.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.523
It's not right
what I'm doing to them either.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.085
I have to let one of them go.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.246
Which one?

07:21.320 --> 07:23.891
- Stefan.
- You okay?

07:24.040 --> 07:25.849
Yeah.

07:30.240 --> 07:33.608
Thanks, man. Tell the kitchen
I appreciate them staying open for me.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.884
We need to talk.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.883
I'm being over-coddled.
I feel completely fine.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.203
You're on house-arrest.
You're supposed to be coddled.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.931
Wouldn't it be smarter
if we just got you out of town?

07:55.080 --> 07:58.846
And do what? Go on the run
for the rest of my life? No, thank you.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.081
And I'm not an invalid.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.003
I'm done with the couch.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.721
So you're just gonna
let her call the shots?

08:09.920 --> 08:13.481
- I let her make her own decisions.
- Even if they're wrong?

08:13.640 --> 08:16.769
Nothing wrong with free will, Matt.
Trust me...

08:17.400 --> 08:20.210
you don't realize that
until you lose it.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.123
Stefan.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.724
Elijah.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.490
Hello again.

08:36.039 --> 08:39.601
I need you to tell me
where they're keeping Klaus' body.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.570
I don't know. And even if I did,
why would I tell you?

08:45.240 --> 08:50.531
Elena's association with vampires nearly
got her killed again tonight, Jeremy.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.451
- Does that even register with you?
- Of course it does.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.171
Well, she can't seem
to cut them out of her life.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.810
But I can.

08:57.960 --> 09:01.089
And with your help...

09:01.680 --> 09:03.921
<i>I'll get rid of all of them.</i>

09:05.400 --> 09:07.926
Find out where Klaus' body
is being hidden.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.481
I'll kill him, all his siblings...

09:10.640 --> 09:14.326
and when I die,
vampires will no longer exist.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.642
The only way for you to die
is if Elena dies.

09:16.800 --> 09:21.328
Then lock me up. Have Bonnie
put a spell on me like she did Klaus.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.768
Let Elena live a long,
healthy human life.

09:26.640 --> 09:30.281
And when her life is over,
mine will be too.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.122
This stake is the one weapon on earth
that can kill them.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.804
I'm gonna get Klaus either way,
Jeremy.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.488
Be on the right side of this.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.806
All we need is to take that stake away
from him. Once he's been disarmed...

09:51.960 --> 09:55.123
the weapon's in my possession,
my family will scatter...

09:55.320 --> 09:57.971
and Alaric will follow us.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.962
- And you'll just run?
- We've done it before.

10:02.160 --> 10:05.881
Klaus and Rebekah spent the better part
of 1000 years evading my father.

10:06.120 --> 10:09.806
What's another half-century while
Elena's able to live out her natural life?

10:10.000 --> 10:14.164
We finally stopped him, Elijah.
After everything that he's done to us...

10:14.320 --> 10:16.482
I can't just let you bring him back.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.849
I give you my word, Elena.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.245
I will not revive Klaus within yours,
nor even within your children's lifetimes.

10:28.840 --> 10:32.686
- Perhaps it'll teach him some manners.
- Why should she trust you?

10:32.840 --> 10:35.889
- All you've done is screw her over.
- And for that, I'm ashamed.

10:36.040 --> 10:39.761
But know this. She could've been dead
the instant I walked through that door.

10:39.920 --> 10:43.606
So, Elena, I leave it to you
to make the decision...

10:43.760 --> 10:45.364
whether to trust me or not.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.929
<i>Not. Hello?</i>

10:48.120 --> 10:49.849
<i>Did that concussion
give you brain damage?</i>

10:50.040 --> 10:52.361
His siblings will kill you
first chance they get!

10:52.520 --> 10:56.570
Rebekah and Kol will honor the terms.
If you return Klaus' body to us...

10:58.040 --> 10:59.530
Elena will come to no harm.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.565
Do we have a deal?

11:06.720 --> 11:11.044
No! No, no, no. Did I mention no?

11:13.880 --> 11:15.041
Elena, it's up to you.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.404
Oh, come on!

11:18.040 --> 11:20.042
Why do you want Klaus' body?

11:21.320 --> 11:22.481
He's my brother.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.122
We remain together.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.089
We have a deal.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.085
Morn?

11:38.240 --> 11:40.083
In here.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.925
Mom.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.648
What's going on?

11:45.800 --> 11:47.768
Alaric outed us to the Council.

11:47.920 --> 11:51.083
He told them everything.
The whole Council knows what you are.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.130
He's got them looking for Klaus.
They're gonna come for you.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.248
You can't be here when they do.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.771
Wait, what are you saying?

12:00.320 --> 12:03.802
- You both need to get out of town.
- I pulled together some cash.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.004
Liz got you some new identification.
We'll get school records...

12:07.280 --> 12:08.770
Wait, you want us to run?

12:08.920 --> 12:12.129
- We can't protect you anymore.
- We can't just pack up and leave!

12:12.800 --> 12:15.804
If you stay,
you're going to end up dead.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.444
You don't have a choice.

12:26.640 --> 12:27.971
So, what are you gonna do?

12:29.120 --> 12:33.125
What I wanna do is run in that house,
grab Elena, and get her out of here...

12:33.280 --> 12:35.806
- ...and away from all this.
- Why don't we?

12:35.960 --> 12:39.043
Good luck getting her past
all the vampires in there.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.843
Even if I wanted to help Alaric...

12:45.120 --> 12:48.408
I have no idea where Klaus' body is.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.410
I do.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.491
<i>- Yes?
- I know where</i>

13:09.680 --> 13:10.761
<i>Klaus' body is.</i>

13:10.920 --> 13:12.365
Good. Tell me.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.325
Damon's on his way to bury him
in the woods off Route 12.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.171
I'll text you with the specifics.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.683
Thank you, Jeremy.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.841
You're doing the right thing
for your sister.

13:26.440 --> 13:27.680
I know.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.806
He bought it.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.960
We can't just leave town.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.771
Yes, we can.
- No, but our friends need us.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.730
And our mothers need us to stay alive.
Look.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.922
Stefan and Damon are gonna do
whatever it takes to protect themselves.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.242
But this is our lives.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.762
So let me protect you.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.328
I will go anywhere with you.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.602
If we have to spend the rest
of our lives running...

14:09.760 --> 14:11.250
I will run with you.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.851
But first, I have to help our friends.

14:19.360 --> 14:23.251
I'll get stuff together and meet you
at the cellar in two hours.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.127
Deal.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.611
We gotta travel light.
So, what do you need?

14:30.840 --> 14:33.207
Just you. Maybe a curling iron.

14:34.880 --> 14:37.884
- I have to tell Bonnie...
- I'll call Bonnie, okay?

14:38.040 --> 14:42.045
- Two hours. Don't you dare be late.
- Okay.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.644
I'm not halfway out of Virginia and Elena
sells our souls to the Originals?

14:52.800 --> 14:55.326
- It was her call.
- You know what else was her call?

14:55.480 --> 14:57.528
Everything bad, ever.

14:57.680 --> 15:00.570
Where's the body?
Alaric is one witch away from finding it.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.001
Hidden. I was gonna use unit 666...

15:03.160 --> 15:05.731
but I figured
that would be a little obvious.

15:05.920 --> 15:09.402
So 1020.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.289
<i>Mini fridge, couple bird cages,
box full of Playboys.</i>

15:16.000 --> 15:18.731
One beef-jerkified Original.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.206
Ew.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.447
Creep)'...

15:32.400 --> 15:34.926
- I need a minute.
- Just jam the witch-locator...

15:35.120 --> 15:37.600
bat-signal, whatever,
and get on with it, Bonnie.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.444
Elena and Jeremy lost Jenna
and Alaric because of him.

15:42.960 --> 15:46.726
Tyler's a hybrid,
my mother's a vampire.

15:47.440 --> 15:51.445
Could you give me a minute to just
appreciate the sight of him like this?

16:01.720 --> 16:03.722
You should burn in hell.

16:04.640 --> 16:08.611
But if you die, so do my friends.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.968
So does my mother.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.883
What am I supposed to do about that?

16:18.960 --> 16:22.248
Stefan, make sure that Alaric
doesn't lay a hand on Jeremy.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.970
Jeremy will be fine.

16:24.120 --> 16:27.920
Between all of us, we'll have the
strength in numbers to disarm Alaric.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.407
Hey.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.289
What's wrong?

16:37.880 --> 16:42.329
Lately, I feel like every time someone
walks out of this house...

16:42.520 --> 16:45.205
there's a chance
they may not make it back home.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.642
Well, I promise...

16:52.160 --> 16:54.481
I will do everything in my power...

16:54.640 --> 16:57.007
to make sure that we all come back.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.290
Stefan?

17:10.920 --> 17:12.922
<i>Forget it, um...</i>

17:13.079 --> 17:15.401
We can talk later.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.282
That's just in case there is no later.

17:56.280 --> 17:59.648
Bonnie just left. Rebekah should
be here soon to pick up the body.

17:59.800 --> 18:04.169
I've got Caroline and Elijah in place.
Jeremy's gonna lead Alaric to us.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.402
Had to let her make the choice,
didn't you?

18:06.600 --> 18:07.647
What would you have done?

18:07.800 --> 18:09.689
Grabbed her, gagged her. I don't know.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.569
Anything other than
let her trust Elijah.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.361
You know she'd just hate you for it,
right?

18:15.520 --> 18:17.522
<i>Yeah. She'd be alive
and she'd hate me.</i>

18:17.680 --> 18:21.366
Thus the eternal difference
between you and me, brother.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.571
Soon as we get the stake,
hand over the coffin, get out.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.210
Alaric's got the police looking...

18:28.360 --> 18:30.169
- ...for Klaus' car.
- Will do.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.245
Gotta go.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.011
The Original sister's here.

18:38.440 --> 18:39.851
It's about time, sexy Bex...

18:41.520 --> 18:43.921
- Where is Klaus?
- How did you find me?

18:44.080 --> 18:46.560
Oh, you'd be amazed how competent
law enforcement is...

18:46.720 --> 18:51.760
when it's not corrupted by vampires.
Now, where is Klaus?

18:52.880 --> 18:56.168
In a storage locker.
There's only about 1000 of them.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.407
Have at it.

19:10.840 --> 19:14.049
- Mm. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.365
Mm.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.884
Sorry, I over-honeyed. I suck at tea.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.045
So Stefan?

19:29.960 --> 19:31.530
He saved my life, you know?

19:32.760 --> 19:34.524
I never told you that.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.160
The night that my parents' car
went off the bridge...

19:37.360 --> 19:39.488
Stefan was the one that saved me.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.483
You feel like you owe him
or something?

19:41.640 --> 19:44.211
No, it's not that. it's...

19:46.240 --> 19:48.561
After the accident...

19:49.160 --> 19:53.245
I kind of felt like I didn't know
how to live anymore.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.888
Like I didn't want to.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.010
But then, being with Stefan, I just...

19:59.160 --> 20:01.561
Somehow I figured it out.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.087
And that's what love should be.

20:05.320 --> 20:09.609
You should love the person
that makes you glad that you're alive, heh.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.402
So then, what's the problem?

20:14.080 --> 20:15.445
The problem is Damon.

20:21.240 --> 20:26.041
When I'm with him,
it just consumes me.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.369
And I know that I can't love them both,
I know that it's wrong...

20:29.520 --> 20:33.969
but when I choose one,
then I'll lose the other.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.404
And I don't want to lose anyone else.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.044
<i>I just...</i>

20:42.240 --> 20:44.129
<i>I just...</i>

20:45.360 --> 20:49.126
I wish that I had my mom here
to give me some advice.

21:05.840 --> 21:09.322
- Hey, it's me.
- Your dad is making me play Pictionary.

21:09.480 --> 21:12.086
- I suck at Pictionary.
- You do. You're terrible.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.571
Bite me, Grayson.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.449
Do you think someone
can come pick me up?

21:15.600 --> 21:18.331
Oh, having second thoughts
about ditching family night?

21:18.480 --> 21:20.164
Here.

21:21.640 --> 21:25.770
- Elena, is everything okay?
- Matt and I got into a fight.

21:25.920 --> 21:29.686
He was talking
about college and marriage...

21:29.880 --> 21:33.202
and all the stuff he always talks about
and I just... I couldn't...

21:33.360 --> 21:35.362
<i>He doesn't really care about that yet.</i>

21:35.560 --> 21:38.166
He's just trying to figure out
how you feel about him.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.971
- I don't know how I feel.
- Yes, you do.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.009
You're just afraid to say it.

21:43.160 --> 21:46.801
<i>- Yeah, but I don't wanna lose him.
- You're not gonna lose him.</i>

21:47.320 --> 21:48.924
You're setting him free.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.760
What's going on?

21:57.960 --> 22:00.645
It's the only way
I was gonna get you in this truck.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.683
The tea.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.207
- You drugged me?
- I'm sorry, but you're right.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.721
You don't have parents
to tell you what's right.

22:09.880 --> 22:13.441
You've got me, Jeremy, and vampires
fighting a war you shouldn't be in.

22:13.640 --> 22:17.167
- What the hell is going on, Matt?
- I'm getting you out of town, Elena.

22:17.320 --> 22:19.004
It's the only way to keep you safe.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.086
Damon.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.485
Damon, where are you?

22:54.880 --> 22:56.609
Damon, this isn't funny.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.611
Rebekah.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.327
Shh.

23:56.640 --> 23:57.721
"No!
"No!

23:57.880 --> 23:59.166
- No! No!
- No.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.528
No!

24:03.680 --> 24:05.011
No! No!

24:20.000 --> 24:21.843
- Next.
- Rebekah.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.485
Run. Run.

24:35.800 --> 24:36.881
Damon?

24:37.440 --> 24:39.204
Bad news, brother.

24:39.360 --> 24:42.887
<i>Alaric staked Klaus. He's dead.</i>

24:45.560 --> 24:46.607
<i>I feel okay.</i>

24:47.240 --> 24:48.526
Do you feel anything?

24:49.560 --> 24:52.564
- No.
- Took Sage an hour before she got sick.

24:52.760 --> 24:55.923
Yeah, or Klaus was lying
about being the sire of our bloodline.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.526
Well, if he wasn't lying...

24:59.880 --> 25:03.771
an hour is not enough time to get you
all the way back to Mystic Falls.

25:04.760 --> 25:07.604
For us to have our epic goodbye,
Stefan?

25:09.920 --> 25:12.127
Not us, brother.

25:12.960 --> 25:14.291
You and Elena.

25:18.040 --> 25:23.080
Well, I guess you'll just have to say
goodbye for both of us, won't you?

25:26.760 --> 25:29.730
Call me if you cough up a lung, huh?

25:33.600 --> 25:36.922
Stefan, Elena's not at home.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.609
Matt and I...

25:41.120 --> 25:43.361
we're getting her out of town.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.881
It's gonna be fine.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.089
Klaus was lying.
We're all gonna be okay.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.450
What happened?

26:01.520 --> 26:02.965
Stefan.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.770
Got it, Jer.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.647
We have to go back.

26:09.320 --> 26:13.041
Listen. If Klaus is the one who turned
their bloodline, they're all gonna die.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.645
We have to go back, Matt.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.729
- Elena.
- What?

26:19.320 --> 26:21.004
Damon's not with them.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.126
- What?
- He's a hundred miles out of town.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.521
I can keep driving to him...

26:26.680 --> 26:28.842
or I can turn around
and go back to Stefan.

26:31.480 --> 26:32.811
It's your choice.

26:45.040 --> 26:48.681
Let me guess. Calling to see
if the grim reaper's paid a visit?

26:48.840 --> 26:50.524
How are you feeling? Any symptoms?

26:50.680 --> 26:52.205
Not yet.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.649
But I'm sure we'll have a laugh when
we find out that Klaus is a big fat liar.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.161
Yeah, I'm sure we will.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.049
Hey, where are you?

27:04.680 --> 27:06.569
Matt's taking me home.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.321
To Stefan.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.210
Not just to Stefan...

27:15.400 --> 27:21.248
- ...Damon, to Tyler, to Caroline.
- No, I know, I get it.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.087
So...

27:26.880 --> 27:31.204
since I'm possibly a dead man...

27:32.560 --> 27:34.528
can I ask you a question?

27:35.080 --> 27:36.241
Yeah, of course.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.404
If it was just down to him and me...

27:40.920 --> 27:45.482
and you had to make a choice,
who got the goodbye?

27:48.520 --> 27:49.885
Who would it be?

27:55.240 --> 27:56.765
I love him, Damon.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.760
He came into my life
when I needed someone...

28:01.920 --> 28:04.571
and I fell for him instantly.

28:05.320 --> 28:08.608
No matter what I feel for you...

28:10.040 --> 28:11.883
I never unfell for him.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.286
<i>Hey, I get it.</i>

28:13.440 --> 28:15.329
Stefan, heh.

28:15.520 --> 28:19.445
It's always gonna be Stefan.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.602
I can't think about always.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.326
All I can think about is right now.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.245
And I care about you, Damon.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.923
Which is why I have to let you go.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.562
I mean, maybe if you and I
had met first.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.963
Yeah, maybe.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.646
You're gonna be fine.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.642
You hear me?

28:50.800 --> 28:54.327
You're gonna be okay
and I'm gonna see you soon.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.483
Real soon.

28:57.640 --> 28:58.687
Goodbye, Elena.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.161
I see you're still pissed.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.800
I take it Goldilocks gave you the slip.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.844
Tyler? Tyler?

29:16.600 --> 29:17.681
Caroline?
- Tyler.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.968
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.690
Hey.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.610
Sorry, I was just with Bonnie.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.485
What happened?

29:29.160 --> 29:31.367
Klaus died.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.204
He's dead.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.683
You're going to be fine, Caroline.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.360
No, it's not me that I'm worried about.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.727
There's no point.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.170
I'm a lost cause.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.927
But you're strong and you have
a beautiful future ahead of you.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.646
And when you make it through this...

30:00.000 --> 30:04.289
just tell my mother I left town
like I was supposed to, okay?

30:34.160 --> 30:35.400
Do you feel anything?

30:37.080 --> 30:38.809
No.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.045
I feel fine.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.487
I need you to get out of here.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.445
- I don't want you to watch me die.
- No, I'm not leaving.

30:51.800 --> 30:52.881
I'm staying.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.121
- No.
- Yes.

30:54.280 --> 30:56.601
You run or I'll make you run.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.091
I'm not leaving.

31:07.480 --> 31:08.811
Go!

31:15.120 --> 31:17.407
You too, Care.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.441
What now?

31:22.160 --> 31:23.969
<i>It's Tyler. He, um...</i>

31:24.960 --> 31:26.371
He's...

31:26.520 --> 31:27.567
Damn it.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.486
- Damn it, damn it, damn it!
- Matt, Matt, no.

31:34.640 --> 31:35.971
Stop it.

31:40.160 --> 31:43.482
This isn't how our lives
were supposed to be, Elena.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.044
He's gone, Elijah.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.083
There was nothing I could do
to stop it.

32:06.960 --> 32:10.681
Tyler Lockwood is dead,
but the rest survived.

32:10.840 --> 32:13.002
You said that Niklaus
turned their bloodline.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.885
- I thought he did.
- It wasn't me, it wasn't Kol.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.202
It wasn't me, Elijah.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.682
It was Niklaus, I'm sure of it.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.771
Then how are they still alive?

32:35.400 --> 32:37.243
I know you're here.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.807
I must say,
you really did that spell brilliantly.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.401
I didn't think you had it in you.

32:50.560 --> 32:54.326
I did it to save my friends
and my mother, Klaus.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.565
Not you.

32:57.400 --> 33:01.246
- The spirits won't be happy with you.
- Spirits don't get to tell me what to do.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.801
I'm done getting pushed around
by all of you.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.449
I did it because I wanted to.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.364
<i>- Hello.
- You're alive.</i>

33:12.520 --> 33:13.885
- Congratulations.
- Rebekah.

33:14.040 --> 33:15.690
Elijah spoke to Elena.

33:15.840 --> 33:18.286
Her and Matt should be arriving
back in town.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.171
Yeah, he told me. Also said
you two would be gone by now.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.687
That's the problem.
Elijah says we have to run...

33:23.840 --> 33:27.481
that the hunter will keep coming
after us, but I don't want to run.

33:27.640 --> 33:30.610
- I've spent my whole life running.
- What? We had a deal.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.764
Well, I'm sorry, but Klaus is dead.
There is no deal.

33:33.920 --> 33:37.083
If my brother's and I are to survive,
we need to get rid of Alaric.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.805
The way to get rid of Alaric...

33:40.680 --> 33:42.603
- Rebekah, no.
- I need to call Stefan...

33:42.760 --> 33:44.171
but my phone is dying.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.685
Here, use mine.

33:47.600 --> 33:48.761
Thanks.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.246
Matt, look out!

34:10.960 --> 34:14.362
Dad?

34:14.520 --> 34:16.648
We're gonna be okay, I promise.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.527
You're not gonna fight back?

34:28.000 --> 34:29.842
You're kind of invincible, Ric.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.485
Don't call me that.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.166
We're not friends.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.007
We were.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.322
Our friendship
was part of the problem.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.050
It's what kept me weak.

34:40.520 --> 34:44.161
That's also why it took so long
for the real me to break through.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.125
And now I'm gonna break you.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.124
I know, Bonnie, you're right.

35:02.280 --> 35:07.207
You and Mom both are,
I just can't bring myself to tell him.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.442
At least not tonight.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.364
I'll call you later.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.203
Katherine.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.524
Um, no, I...

35:22.720 --> 35:23.767
I'm Elena.

35:25.480 --> 35:27.881
Oh, you...

35:28.600 --> 35:30.568
You just look...

35:32.040 --> 35:33.610
I'm sorry.

35:33.760 --> 35:37.560
You just really remind me of someone.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.321
I'm Damon.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.403
Not to be rude or anything, Damon...

35:42.560 --> 35:46.326
but it's kind of creepy that you're
out here in the middle of nowhere.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.482
You're one to talk.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.409
You're out here all by yourself.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.451
It's Mystic Falls.
Nothing bad ever happens here.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.809
I got into a fight with my boyfriend.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.247
About what? May I ask?

36:03.800 --> 36:05.962
Life, the future.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.485
He's got it all mapped out.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.080
You don't want it?

36:10.600 --> 36:11.965
I don't know what I want.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.805
Well, that's not true.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.929
You want what everybody wants.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.451
What?

36:19.600 --> 36:22.206
Mysterious stranger
who has all the answers.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.447
Well, let's just say
I've been around a long time.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.683
I've learned a few things.

36:29.840 --> 36:33.481
So, Damon, tell me.

36:33.640 --> 36:36.041
What is it that I want?

36:38.480 --> 36:40.608
You want a love that consumes you.

36:42.120 --> 36:48.127
You want passion and adventure
and even a little danger.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.009
So, what do you want?

36:56.400 --> 36:57.481
Uh...

37:01.120 --> 37:02.360
That's my parents.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.963
I want you to get everything
you're looking for.

37:07.160 --> 37:09.561
But right now,
I want you to forget this happened.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.888
Can't have people knowing
I'm in town yet.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.162
Good night, Elena.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.201
- Is that all you got?
- Not quite.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.129
- What's happening?
- Oh, no.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.205
- What's happening?
- What?

39:54.440 --> 39:55.487
Ric.

39:55.640 --> 39:59.167
- Argh.
- No, no, no.

39:59.320 --> 40:02.563
Ric.

40:04.720 --> 40:08.486
You're not dead.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.368
Matt, man, where are you guys?
You should've been back by now...

40:13.040 --> 40:14.201
Jeremy.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.321
Haven't you done enough?

40:23.000 --> 40:24.525
And how'd you even get in here?

40:24.680 --> 40:26.045
I don't know.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.851
Just wanted to say goodbye
and it kind of happened.

40:30.520 --> 40:31.567
Ric?

40:35.680 --> 40:37.682
I just want you to know...

40:38.000 --> 40:40.685
that I'll always be here
to look after you, Jeremy.

40:42.760 --> 40:44.842
That you'll never be alone.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.690
Okay?

40:47.520 --> 40:48.681
I promise.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.205
I don't understand.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.048
Oh, my God. You're a ghost.

40:58.760 --> 40:59.807
But if you're dead...

41:02.280 --> 41:03.805
that means Elena...

41:20.720 --> 41:23.121
- Where is she? Where is she?
- No, Damon, wait.

41:23.280 --> 41:26.602
When Jeremy brought Elena
in here earlier, her injuries were worse...

41:26.760 --> 41:30.401
than I let on. It wasn't a concussion.
It was a cerebral hemorrhage.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.483
Bleeding on the brain.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.244
What are you saying?

41:34.400 --> 41:36.926
He was so worried,
I didn't wanna tell him, but I...

41:37.080 --> 41:39.765
I helped her. She needed my help.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.049
You what?
