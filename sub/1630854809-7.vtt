WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:01.523
<i>Previously on "The Ark"...</i>

00:01.523 --> 00:03.264
I had to eject too much U-238

00:03.264 --> 00:04.569
during the meltdown.

00:04.569 --> 00:06.310
We won'’t get to Prox B
for decades.

00:06.310 --> 00:09.531
I found a planet that
is rich in uranium-238.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.533
William Trust is stashed
in a cryopod in a hidden room.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.013
Maybe I should just go tell Garnet.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.666
No, you can'’t
tell anyone else.

00:14.666 --> 00:18.148
Is it true you picked Ark 5
for your own departure

00:18.148 --> 00:21.456
because you'’re afraid
the earlier arks won'’t make it
to their destinations?

00:21.456 --> 00:24.328
So you were supposed
to be on Ark 5.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.069
Someone got
into the drug cabinet and stole
most of the drugs again.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.375
You'’re done
with the pills, doctor.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.898
<i>They introduced additional</i>

00:28.898 --> 00:31.509
<i>experimental DNA
into our systems.</i>

00:31.509 --> 00:33.685
<i>I can withstand
more solar radiation than
you can, for example.</i>

00:33.685 --> 00:35.252
The star just threw off
a massive solar flare.

00:35.252 --> 00:36.949
We can'’t pull out
of the star'’s gravity

00:36.949 --> 00:38.734
without all of the sails.

00:38.734 --> 00:41.041
The solar radiation would fry
anyone who goes out there.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.782
Dr. Hall'’s alterations
must have worked.

00:43.782 --> 00:46.307
Remember that sensor algorithm
that Angus and I came up with

00:46.307 --> 00:48.396
- to detect the substance
that burnt the ship?
- Yes.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.615
It just detected
loads of it on the planet
we'’re headed towards.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.748
What we need
is an advance scout,

00:52.748 --> 00:53.749
- but we don'’t have
one of those either.
- The shuttle, right?

00:53.749 --> 00:55.794
Then I'’ll go, too, to assist.

00:55.794 --> 00:58.014
- I have Klampkins disease.
- There'’s no cure.

00:58.014 --> 01:00.930
The U-238 and the Aliciaminium,
they'’re on another ship.

01:03.628 --> 01:08.372
<i>I repeat, this is Lieutenant
Sharon Garnet of Ark 1.</i>

01:08.372 --> 01:11.158
<i>Please respond.</i>

01:11.158 --> 01:14.117
<i>Ark 3, if you are
in need of aid,</i>

01:14.117 --> 01:18.208
- please signal.
- It'’s been an hour.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.688
If they didn'’t respond
to your first hail,

01:19.688 --> 01:22.343
they'’re not gonna reply
to the 15th.

01:22.343 --> 01:24.519
But their rotation segments
are still turning.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.738
You think
they'’re still in cryo?

01:26.738 --> 01:28.784
I don'’t know what to think.
I mean, why are they even here?

01:28.784 --> 01:33.832
Better question-- how.
How are they even here?

01:33.832 --> 01:36.835
How are they ahead of us?

01:36.835 --> 01:38.576
We launched years
before Ark 3.

01:38.576 --> 01:41.536
Oh, yeah.
That part'’s impossible.

01:41.536 --> 01:42.885
What are you seeing, Brice?

01:42.885 --> 01:45.409
Oh, you know, just the usual.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.499
Stars,
vast emptiness of space,

01:48.499 --> 01:50.458
a great big bloody spaceship
that shouldn'’t be here.

01:50.458 --> 01:54.201
It'’s the source of U-238
we detected.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.419
I'’m gonna get a closer look.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.509
Yeah, well, be careful, Brice.

01:59.728 --> 02:00.946
Never.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.122
Are you enjoying this?

02:15.483 --> 02:16.832
You guys seeing this?

02:16.832 --> 02:19.095
Now we know why
our sensors picked up traces

02:19.095 --> 02:20.749
of the element
that melted our hull.

02:20.749 --> 02:22.272
<i>You mean
the Aliciaminium?</i>

02:22.272 --> 02:25.710
So that means whatever hit us
also hit Ark 3.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.479
We'’re sure it's the same
element that hit us?

02:55.479 --> 02:57.177
Look at
the disintegration pattern.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.092
It'’s consistent with
how our hull was damaged.

03:00.092 --> 03:02.486
- Nice look, Sharon.
- Yeah?

03:02.486 --> 03:04.488
Think I might keep it
after my burns are healed.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.490
The breach on the Ark 3
is smaller than ours.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.231
Well, then, safeties
should have locked it down

03:08.231 --> 03:09.711
and secured
the rest of the ship.

03:09.711 --> 03:12.017
So why is no one responding?

03:12.017 --> 03:14.281
The only way to get answers
is to board Ark 3.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.370
Are you volunteering?

03:16.370 --> 03:18.328
He'’s right.
We don'’t
have a choice.

03:18.328 --> 03:22.550
They have the U-238
we need to reach Prox B.

03:22.550 --> 03:25.161
I want to see their NEPS
to figure out how
they got ahead of us.

03:25.161 --> 03:26.945
Ooh, and I'’d love
a crack at their database.

03:26.945 --> 03:28.077
We could find out
what happened on Earth.

03:28.077 --> 03:29.296
No, no, no.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.732
You can monitor from here,

03:30.732 --> 03:32.473
at least until
we know it'’s safe.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.736
Agreed,
and you'’re staying put,
too, Sharon.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.259
You can hardly stand
right now.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.740
That goes without saying, unfortunately.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.959
Grab whoever you need,
but keep it small.

03:40.959 --> 03:43.527
I'’ll prep the shuttle.
We launch in 30.

03:47.749 --> 03:50.708
Something
on your mind, Spencer?

03:50.708 --> 03:54.495
Have I mentioned how happy I am
that you were improved?

03:54.495 --> 03:56.932
Is that your way
of thanking me?

03:56.932 --> 03:58.934
You almost died for us.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.588
You would'’ve done
the same thing.

04:00.588 --> 04:03.765
No, I judged you
for being a clone,

04:03.765 --> 04:05.245
but that'’s what
saved us twice.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.943
And I'’m sorry.

04:09.553 --> 04:12.513
You know how you
can make it up to me?

04:12.513 --> 04:15.255
Be careful over there.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.608
You know, it'’s really hard
to take you seriously in that.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.827
It is weird, isn'’t it?

04:28.790 --> 04:30.574
You'’re doing it again.

04:30.574 --> 04:31.706
You'’re gonna have to be
a bit more specific.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.795
I do a lot of things.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.058
Volunteering
for a dangerous mission.

04:36.058 --> 04:39.409
Pretty sure it'’s
the same mission you'’ve just
volunteered for as well.

04:39.409 --> 04:42.282
- I'’m not dying.
- We'’re all dying,

04:42.282 --> 04:44.066
just some of us are
a little quicker than others.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.247
This is serious.

04:51.247 --> 04:54.381
All right, so, um,
what'’s the difference

04:54.381 --> 04:57.645
if I die on Ark 1 or on Ark 3?

04:57.645 --> 05:00.430
- What if you pass out again?
- Well, you'’ll be there.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.258
Quite clearly,
can'’t leave me alone.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.062
Excellent work, carry on.

05:26.064 --> 05:28.545
- Cat?
- Oh, don'’t mind me, Lieutenant.

05:28.545 --> 05:31.722
Cat, we'’re kind of
in the middle of something.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.855
I know. I want to watch.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.642
Okay, fine.
I got my best friend

05:38.642 --> 05:40.427
a guaranteed spot
on one of the other arks.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.471
Now I'’m worried
that she got on Ark 3.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.212
I tried to get her
on this ark,

05:43.212 --> 05:44.518
but there were only
so many strings I could pull.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.171
That'’s not fair.

05:46.171 --> 05:48.957
People trailed for years
to be part of the Ark program.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.828
The selection process
was cutthroat.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.482
Who did you know that
could just get people on?

05:52.482 --> 05:55.311
- Everyone, dear.
- I appreciate your concern,

05:55.311 --> 05:58.575
but the bridge
is not for spectators.

05:58.575 --> 06:00.447
You can watch from Observation.

06:02.927 --> 06:03.798
Fine.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.719
Hey, did you just
come from the bridge?

06:11.719 --> 06:14.417
- Is Lieutenant Garnet there?
- Yeah, but she'’s really busy.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.463
I just wanted
to give her a gift.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.334
Well, it'’s not a gift, really.

06:18.334 --> 06:21.990
it'’s more of a thank you
for saving the ship.

06:21.990 --> 06:25.689
It'’s aloe. For her burns?

06:27.909 --> 06:30.346
You beautiful little idiot.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.522
You need to get over
your crush on Garnet.

06:32.522 --> 06:35.960
Crush? No, that'’s crazy.
I don'’t have a crush on anyone.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.356
- Is it that obvious?
- And that stupid.

06:40.356 --> 06:44.404
You need someone more
your speed and age.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.015
Wha-- like who?

06:47.015 --> 06:50.322
You really can'’t think of
anyone who fits that profile?

07:09.167 --> 07:11.692
We do this by the numbers.

07:11.692 --> 07:13.781
Consider this
a search and rescue.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.846
I think we'’re a little late
for the rescue part.

07:45.682 --> 07:50.034
Blue skin, bloodshot eyes,
burst capillaries.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.385
- She suffocated.
- Same here.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.735
So they died from the breach.

07:54.735 --> 07:58.565
Eva, can you get
life support up?

07:58.565 --> 08:00.567
Life support reads
as already up.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.220
Then how did these
people suffocate?

08:02.220 --> 08:04.571
It was a hull breach.
The whole ship lost pressure

08:04.571 --> 08:05.833
before the bulkheads
could seal.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.791
But they did eventually seal.

08:07.791 --> 08:12.404
Yes, that'’s when
life support came back on.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.189
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

08:14.189 --> 08:16.017
We have to leave these on.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.453
I just said
life support was on.

08:22.414 --> 08:25.635
You stay here and keep
a watch on our EVA gear.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.508
- Who am I protecting it from?
- Hopefully nobody.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.640
Why weren'’t
these people in cryo?

08:30.640 --> 08:31.859
You hearing all this, Sharon?

08:31.859 --> 08:34.339
Every word.

08:34.339 --> 08:35.863
Although I kind of
wish we weren'’t.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.647
I'’ll head to the bridge,

08:37.647 --> 08:39.214
try and access the ship'’s files,

08:39.214 --> 08:40.607
see if we can figure out
what happened here.

08:40.607 --> 08:43.348
I'’ll start
identifying the bodies.

08:43.348 --> 08:45.655
<i>Eva, Brice, Sasha,
you guys split up.</i>

08:45.655 --> 08:47.135
Go to the sleeper pod bays.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.136
Hopefully whoever'’s
still in cryo

08:48.136 --> 08:49.746
<i>can get us some answers.</i>

09:08.286 --> 09:11.246
There are two lieutenants
and a commander here,

09:11.246 --> 09:13.335
all with the same signs
of asphyxiation.

09:34.748 --> 09:37.359
- You'’re being oddly quiet.
- These people had lives,

09:37.359 --> 09:42.059
- families.
- You all right?

09:42.059 --> 09:45.628
It reminds me of the mass graves
after the continental fires.

09:45.628 --> 09:48.588
I hoped I'’d never see
anything like it again.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.721
Yeah, at least they died
a quick death, eh?

09:51.721 --> 09:53.593
Sometimes a slow death
is worse.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.421
You know what my grandma
told me when she was dying?

09:56.421 --> 09:59.773
A slow death just means
a longer life.

10:05.517 --> 10:09.652
We'’re at Sleeper Pod Bay 1.

10:09.652 --> 10:13.134
Garnet, this is gonna
sound weird, but, uh,

10:13.134 --> 10:14.570
Sleeper Pod Bay 1
isn'’t here.

10:14.570 --> 10:18.313
It'’s just a giant
crew quarters instead.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.924
<i>Same with
Sleeper Pod Bay 2.</i>

10:20.924 --> 10:23.057
Arks 1 through 9
all had the same

10:23.057 --> 10:24.972
William Trust design
and layout.

10:24.972 --> 10:29.411
So the sleeper pod bays
were removed before departure?

10:29.411 --> 10:31.239
But why?

10:37.375 --> 10:40.161
I'’ve got more bad news.
My command codes
don'’t work here.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.772
- <i>I'’m locked out of the system.</i>
- It was worth a shot.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.948
With no survivors and no access
to the ship'’s logs,

10:44.948 --> 10:46.341
I don'’t know how
we'’re gonna get any answers.

10:48.386 --> 10:51.781
I'’m in captain's quarters.
No dead people.

11:03.532 --> 11:04.794
Mmm.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.393
<i>Sash, you all right?</i>

11:38.393 --> 11:42.092
Yeah, I just found
the captain'’s body
in his closet.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.834
- Sorry, mate, it sounded
like you just said closet.
- Yeah, I did.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.794
<i>What the hell
was he doing there?</i>

11:53.843 --> 11:56.280
Um, anyone close to
the captain'’s quarters?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.195
<i>I just got locked in.</i>

11:58.195 --> 12:00.023
- How?
- Beats me, but--

12:02.330 --> 12:03.592
The air is venting!

12:03.592 --> 12:06.116
- We'’re close.
- Hang on!

12:10.251 --> 12:11.295
Help me!

12:13.384 --> 12:16.257
- Sash? Sash, listen to me.
- Help!

12:16.257 --> 12:18.999
You have to calm down, okay?
Conserve your air.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.696
- We'’ve got this.
- Help me!

12:20.696 --> 12:24.221
You have to conserve your air.
Calm down.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.702
- We have got this, right?
- After Harris died,

12:26.702 --> 12:30.053
I taught myself how to
bypass every lock on Ark 1.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.707
- These locks work the same?
- We'’ll find out.

12:36.886 --> 12:39.846
Sash? Sash?

12:39.846 --> 12:41.325
Oh, shit.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.071
Come on, pal. Come on!

12:48.071 --> 12:50.291
One, two--

12:50.291 --> 12:51.771
Sasha!
You'’re all right, buddy.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.163
I'’ve got you. I've got you.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.817
Come on, relax.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.646
Hey, hey, wait, wait.
Don'’t go in there.

13:01.868 --> 13:05.349
Shit.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.439
In case it closes again.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.311
If it does,
it will cut you in half.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.442
A very quick death.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.930
Did you find anything?

13:20.930 --> 13:23.237
Wait, the biohazard detector
thought he was a contaminant?

13:23.237 --> 13:25.892
An error.
So it vented the room.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.851
You ever seen an error
like this before?

13:28.851 --> 13:29.721
Never.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.512
- Transmitting.
- Received.

13:37.512 --> 13:40.123
Match confirmed.
Ensign Maura Mishra.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.038
She'’s not supposed
to be on Ark 3 either.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.431
<i>That'’s 12 personnel matches,</i>

13:43.431 --> 13:45.346
none of them were scheduled
to be on Ark 3.

13:45.346 --> 13:46.695
<i>At least not when we left.</i>

13:46.695 --> 13:48.784
Our records wouldn'’t
be updated beyond that.

13:48.784 --> 13:52.614
Why would they change
the whole ship'’s crew manifest?

13:52.614 --> 13:54.485
Could it be that--

13:56.923 --> 14:00.796
Felix, the computer
says this is--

14:00.796 --> 14:04.104
Robert, my husband.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.280
<i>Did you know he was onboard?</i>

14:06.280 --> 14:08.935
No, he wasn'’t supposed
to come here

14:08.935 --> 14:11.111
until we cleared Prox B
for habitation,

14:11.111 --> 14:14.984
and even then he could only come
once Katheryn was old enough.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.033
Where'’s our daughter?
Where'’s Katheryn?

14:24.080 --> 14:26.778
Has anyone come across
any bodies of children?

14:26.778 --> 14:28.171
<i>No, thank God.</i>

14:28.171 --> 14:30.391
Neither have I.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.480
But there are adult bodies everywhere.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.875
<i>It'’s like being
in a floating coffin.
Why do you ask?</i>

14:35.875 --> 14:38.660
I-- I just found
my husband'’s body.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.358
Oh, Felix, I'’m so sorry.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.273
I'’m scared
my kid is on here, too.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.884
Has anyone checked med bay?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.624
Brice over Intercom:
<i>Me and Eva will check it</i>

14:46.624 --> 14:48.452
<i>on our way to Engineering,
all right, pal?</i>

14:48.452 --> 14:49.889
<i>Copy that.</i>

14:49.889 --> 14:51.194
I'’ll head to
the First Mate'’s quarters,

14:51.194 --> 14:52.413
see what I can find.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.207
Everyone be on high alert.

15:04.207 --> 15:07.254
I just found a guy who appears
to have been stabbed to death.

15:38.807 --> 15:41.418
Ow! My arm is broken! Ow!

15:41.418 --> 15:42.637
Too bad! You were
trying to kill me.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.334
- Who are you?
- Who the hell are you?

15:44.334 --> 15:46.249
You'’re the first living person
we'’ve seen since we boarded.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.425
- Boarded?
- Yes, we'’re from Ark 1.

15:48.425 --> 15:50.210
Wait, so the guy in
Captain Bishop'’s quarters?

15:50.210 --> 15:52.647
He was one of ours.
Ah, let me guess.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.083
That little biohazard trick
was you, too.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.824
I thought you were part
of the other group.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.260
Wait, there are
more survivors?

15:57.260 --> 15:59.175
Seven of them.
They were killing us.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.524
They'’re set up in med bay.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.570
- Med bay?
- They'’re dangerous and--

16:02.570 --> 16:04.702
Brice, Eva,
there are hostiles
in the med bay.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.704
I repeat, there are
seven hostiles in med bay.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.097
I don'’t think
they'’re hostile anymore.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.321
We'’ve got seven
dead bodies down here.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.763
Looks like
they all overdosed.

16:21.763 --> 16:25.071
- They'’re dead? All of them?
- <i>Who is that?</i>

16:25.071 --> 16:27.595
Believe it or not,
a survivor.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.118
<i>Look, keep your comms open
and stand by.</i>

16:32.774 --> 16:35.385
Listen, I need answers.
What the hell happened here?

16:35.385 --> 16:37.561
- The ship was hit.
- By what?

16:37.561 --> 16:39.607
I don'’t know.
It all happened so fast.

16:39.607 --> 16:42.653
We lost atmosphere and--
and then almost everyone died.

16:42.653 --> 16:46.527
- But you survived? How?
- 12 of us were suited up
for a maintenance run

16:46.527 --> 16:48.616
- when the ship decompressed.
- Then what?

16:48.616 --> 16:51.140
We kept our helmets on
until we could
regain life support

16:51.140 --> 16:52.794
- and get the breach
sealed off.
- Then what?

16:52.794 --> 16:54.317
No one could agree
on what to do.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.102
The five of us
from Engineering,

16:56.102 --> 16:57.451
we came up with
a survival plan,

16:57.451 --> 16:58.452
but the others didn'’t agree.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.889
They killed three of us.

17:00.889 --> 17:03.544
And Ross and I,
we had to lock ourselves
in the mess hall--

17:03.544 --> 17:05.676
- Wait. Wait, stop!
- And then we--

17:05.676 --> 17:06.503
There'’s someone else?

17:10.551 --> 17:13.249
Ross, there'’s another ark!

17:13.249 --> 17:16.600
Ross? Where is he?

17:17.949 --> 17:18.994
We never leave this room.

17:23.955 --> 17:25.522
So you'’re the survivor.

17:25.522 --> 17:28.177
I need to know
about one of your crew.

17:28.177 --> 17:31.267
Robert Strickland,
he was my husband.

17:31.267 --> 17:34.357
Um, I'’m sorry,
I don'’t know.

17:34.357 --> 17:37.143
- What was his name again?
- Robert Strickland.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.275
I think I found your friend.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.018
Ross!

17:46.456 --> 17:47.892
There'’s another ark.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.375
We'’re going to be okay.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.689
- What happened to him?
- I don'’t know. I don't know.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.125
They beat him,
but we got away.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.214
He was conscious
when I left him.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.177
Internal bleeding.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.613
- You can tell just from--
- Classic presentation.

18:12.613 --> 18:13.570
I need to operate right now.
Can you set that arm?

18:13.570 --> 18:15.137
Yes, of course.

18:19.402 --> 18:23.189
You'’re still
going through withdrawal.
Are you up to this?

18:23.189 --> 18:24.668
I have to be.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.368
Defibrillator.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.111
Clear!

19:18.461 --> 19:19.549
Clear!

19:21.247 --> 19:22.291
Clear!

19:23.901 --> 19:26.687
Clear!

19:26.687 --> 19:30.081
No, you can'’t be in here.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.693
You cannot be in here.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.482
I'’m all that's left.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.289
Um, you don'’t need a cast
as long as you promise

20:03.289 --> 20:05.595
to keep your arm immobilized.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.294
Hey.

20:08.294 --> 20:11.297
Sorry, you said--
what did you say?

20:11.297 --> 20:13.516
You need to keep
your arm immobilized.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.692
Okay.

20:15.692 --> 20:19.957
- You never answered
my question from before.
- Huh?

20:19.957 --> 20:21.698
Did you know
Robert Strickland?

20:21.698 --> 20:27.138
Yeah, a little.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.749
We sat together
at mess sometimes.

20:28.749 --> 20:31.055
- You did?
- Yeah.

20:31.055 --> 20:34.320
He seemed like
a really great guy.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.452
Do you know why
he was on your ship?

20:36.452 --> 20:38.715
Same reason as most of us,
I guess.

20:38.715 --> 20:42.066
When Ark 3 was
redirected to Proxima B,

20:42.066 --> 20:45.156
family members
of the crew of Ark 1
got priority status.

20:45.156 --> 20:48.769
Ark 3 was redirected
to Prox B?

20:48.769 --> 20:52.251
Oh, yeah.
He told me about you.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.210
Felix, right?
You work security.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.908
- Yes, that'’s me.
- Yeah, I remember now.

20:57.908 --> 21:01.260
He really loved you.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.870
Couldn'’t wait
to see you again.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.264
And my daughter Katheryn?

21:05.264 --> 21:09.224
Um, he never
mentioned a daughter.

21:09.224 --> 21:11.574
- How old is she?
- She would be eight.

21:14.403 --> 21:19.016
I'’m sorry, but there were
no kids on Ark 3.

21:38.427 --> 21:41.256
Hey, she could still
be alive on Earth.

21:43.258 --> 21:48.045
Robert wouldn'’t have
left her if she was alive.

21:48.045 --> 21:51.614
I shouldn'’t have left them.

21:51.614 --> 21:53.442
I should have stayed on Earth.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.446
You had no choice.

21:57.446 --> 22:00.449
You told me you were
ordered to be on Ark 1.

22:00.449 --> 22:03.060
- Okay.
- I should have
disobeyed orders!

22:03.060 --> 22:06.847
Felix, Felix!
Okay, okay, okay.

22:06.847 --> 22:09.328
Okay, okay.

22:11.025 --> 22:13.070
Okay, it'’s okay.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.115
It'’s okay.

22:19.512 --> 22:21.078
- You'’ve got to know something.
- We need to know exactly

22:21.078 --> 22:22.645
where you were heading
and what exactly hit you.

22:22.645 --> 22:25.909
- What was it? You must know.
- Quiet!

22:28.869 --> 22:30.784
Let her catch her breath.

22:30.784 --> 22:33.961
- I was only
an engineering trainee.
- We understand.

22:33.961 --> 22:36.790
But anything
you can tell us will help.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.096
How did Ark 3 get so far
into space ahead of us?

22:39.096 --> 22:42.317
- We traveled faster
than light speed.
- Not possible.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.972
Trying to crack FTL
drove William Trust mad.

22:44.972 --> 22:48.715
Actually, Trust solved
light speed. Theoretically.

22:48.715 --> 22:51.065
You just need to create
a space-time bubble
around a ship

22:51.065 --> 22:53.197
and then propel it
through the ensuing quantum
distortion tunnel.

22:53.197 --> 22:55.722
- Oh, is that all?
- Trust couldn'’t figure out

22:55.722 --> 22:58.681
- how to contain a warp bubble.
- Evelyn Maddox figured it out.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.683
The trillionaire who
took over Trust Industries?

23:00.683 --> 23:02.642
That woman figured out
faster than light speed?

23:02.642 --> 23:04.992
She figured out how to convert
energy into negative energy.

23:04.992 --> 23:07.908
It was part of my training.

23:07.908 --> 23:10.563
Negative energy.
Oh, that'’s brilliant!

23:10.563 --> 23:13.392
Negative energy would maintain
the integrity of the bubble.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.960
- Oh, it'’s so obvious.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, that is--
it'’s very obvious.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.920
Just dumb it down
a bit though for Lane,
'’cause he's struggling.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.357
It'’s like if you put
a space-time bubble

23:22.357 --> 23:25.969
into a quantum flow--
uh, never mind.

23:25.969 --> 23:29.364
The details don'’t matter.
Just know that it'’s brilliant.

23:29.364 --> 23:31.235
The arks were all
in the process of being built,

23:31.235 --> 23:33.237
so they kept
the Trust designs the same.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.718
Yes, I remember reading
how Trust insisted

23:35.718 --> 23:38.373
that all the arks be built
to withstand FTL speeds.

23:38.373 --> 23:40.419
He was that confident
he'’d crack it.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.378
So they swapped in
faster-than-light engines.

23:43.378 --> 23:48.165
Kind of. Her FTL tech
was designed to retrofit
onto Trust'’s NEPS.

23:48.165 --> 23:51.255
So you told Strickland
that your ship

23:51.255 --> 23:52.953
- got redirected to Proxima B.
- Yeah.

23:52.953 --> 23:55.390
With FTL, the leaders
thought that we should go

23:55.390 --> 23:57.958
to the most likely candidate
to support life.

23:57.958 --> 24:00.874
So they decided that Ark 3
should join you at Proxima B.

24:00.874 --> 24:03.398
You mean beat us there.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.661
Our trip would only take
nine months total with FTL.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.620
So, yeah, we would have
gotten there first.

24:07.620 --> 24:10.971
So that'’s why you
had no sleeper pods.

24:10.971 --> 24:13.190
You didn'’t need them
for such a short trip.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.192
Hold on, you were Ark 3.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.280
We'’re Ark 1. Where's Ark 2?

24:19.196 --> 24:22.548
It was the first attempt at FTL.

24:22.548 --> 24:26.421
But it didn'’t work.

24:26.421 --> 24:29.293
Ark 2 vaporized when it tried
to go to light speed.

24:36.997 --> 24:39.042
A lot of my friends
from training died.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.526
We'’ll take a break.

24:55.581 --> 24:57.844
Kelly.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.802
I want you to know
you'’re safe now.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.589
Why don'’t you
take a walk around?

25:03.589 --> 25:04.503
Check out your new home.

25:22.477 --> 25:25.393
Oh, I'’m sorry, Lieutenant,
but this area'’s for spectators.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.526
You need to do your
commanding from the bridge.

25:30.877 --> 25:34.228
- You heal fast.
- How can I get some
of that clone stuff?

25:34.228 --> 25:37.753
Trust me, you don'’t want
the baggage that goes with it.

25:37.753 --> 25:42.323
We'’ve identified the bodies.
I thought you'’d want to check
the list for your friend.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.151
Here'’s the thing, Cat.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.849
No one from Ark 3
was supposed to be
on that ship.

25:46.849 --> 25:50.113
They must have changed
the entire crew manifest
after we left.

25:50.113 --> 25:51.680
She'’s not here. Thank God.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.076
What was Earth like
when you left?

25:56.076 --> 25:57.294
Why did Ark 3 launch so early?

25:57.294 --> 25:58.644
Is it true someone
set off a nuke?

25:58.644 --> 26:00.863
Could our families
still be alive?

26:00.863 --> 26:02.343
What happened to all
the plants and the animals?

26:02.343 --> 26:04.911
Yes, and food, food.
Please tell us
where the food is.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.086
- There'’s got to be some.
- We deserve to know.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.751
Everyone,
give her some space.

26:18.751 --> 26:22.319
Coming through.
Coming through.

26:22.319 --> 26:26.106
Yes, but we have
a lot of questions,
and we need the answers.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.935
Quiet!

26:31.720 --> 26:35.550
Everyone, I am sure
that you all understand

26:35.550 --> 26:38.553
that Kelly is dealing
with a loss that no one
should ever have to.

26:38.553 --> 26:41.904
- Let'’s give her some room.
- Yes, but can you tell us
about the Earth, please?

26:41.904 --> 26:45.560
No more questions.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.563
I am sure that Kelly
will be happy to answer
our questions

26:48.563 --> 26:52.654
- when she is feeling better.
- I don'’t mind.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.352
I would prefer
to debrief you---

26:55.352 --> 26:57.703
I'’ll tell them what I can.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.313
I don'’t blame them
for wondering.

26:59.313 --> 27:00.444
I would, too.

27:02.272 --> 27:06.146
But, um, it'’s pretty bad.

27:06.146 --> 27:08.148
- Yeah, I would like--
- We want to know what happened.

27:08.148 --> 27:10.150
- Let her talk.
- We have a right to know.

27:10.150 --> 27:13.240
Come on, Lieutenant.
What are you so afraid of?

27:25.165 --> 27:27.820
I can only tell you
what it was like when we left.

27:27.820 --> 27:31.214
I don'’t know
what it'’s like now.

27:31.214 --> 27:35.001
But when we left, carbonization
had gotten much worse

27:35.001 --> 27:37.743
at a much faster rate than
the government told us it would.

27:37.743 --> 27:42.399
<i>New Africa, Australia,</i>

27:42.399 --> 27:45.185
<i>both American continents
had fires that grew so big,</i>

27:45.185 --> 27:46.229
<i>they couldn'’t be controlled.</i>

27:49.232 --> 27:52.496
<i>Most people couldn'’t
escape the fires fast enough
and they died.</i>

27:54.498 --> 27:57.371
<i>Japan, New Zealand, Florida,</i>

27:57.371 --> 28:00.853
<i>islands like Hawaii,</i>

28:00.853 --> 28:04.421
they were submerged
by the rising tides.

28:04.421 --> 28:06.249
All except
the highest mountaintops.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.296
What about the old
Europe continent?

28:11.211 --> 28:12.821
It basically
fell into anarchy.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.651
World government collapsed,
so there was no one

28:16.651 --> 28:18.044
to distribute water
that hadn'’t been poisoned.

28:18.044 --> 28:20.960
So, if the government collapsed,

28:20.960 --> 28:22.918
are there no more arks?

28:22.918 --> 28:26.095
The GSA was still operating
when we left.

28:28.663 --> 28:30.621
<i>They saw it coming,
locked down,</i>

28:30.621 --> 28:31.840
<i>and accelerated the program.</i>

28:34.451 --> 28:36.236
<i>When we left, there were
twelve arks ready to go</i>

28:36.236 --> 28:37.237
<i>and more on the way.</i>

28:43.243 --> 28:46.942
I don'’t know if any of them
actually got out of dock.

28:50.032 --> 28:52.165
So we may be all
that'’s left of humanity.

29:09.704 --> 29:11.662
There are months of food
and supplies over there.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.273
We should take
whatever we can use.

29:13.273 --> 29:14.709
Lane, you and I
can get our shuttle

29:14.709 --> 29:15.710
and Ark 3'’s shuttle
going back and forth,

29:15.710 --> 29:18.278
cut down our transport time.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.410
I need to see
the Maddox retrofit.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.891
You gonna install it here?
- Sure as hell going to try.

29:26.112 --> 29:30.116
- You wanted to see Kelly?
- Yes.

29:30.116 --> 29:34.076
- Feeling better?
- Dr. Brandice gave me
some clean clothes

29:34.076 --> 29:35.730
- and let me clean up
a little.
- Good.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.298
What I really wanted to do
is get at that ratty hair,

29:38.298 --> 29:39.473
but you called before
I could get her in the shower.

29:39.473 --> 29:40.561
Thanks, Cat.

29:44.043 --> 29:45.392
Oh, right.

29:45.392 --> 29:48.308
I'’m not needed on the bridge.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.748
We'’re organizing teams
to go to Ark 3

29:53.748 --> 29:57.143
to get the food, U-238,
and the Maddox retrofit.

29:57.143 --> 30:00.755
I just wanted to know
if you knew of anything else
over there we could use?

30:00.755 --> 30:03.366
Um, there might be
some medicine in the med bay.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.760
- My team will get it.
- Good.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.286
Do you still want
to go to Ark 3?

30:10.286 --> 30:13.550
Well, the fact that
it'’s littered with dead bodies
makes it less appealing.

30:13.550 --> 30:16.336
- Um, but yes.
- Good.

30:16.336 --> 30:17.946
Grab Angus and see
if you can salvage

30:17.946 --> 30:20.557
Ark 3'’s external video
of what hit them.

30:20.557 --> 30:23.822
Um, we already tried.
The video'’s corrupt.

30:23.822 --> 30:28.304
- It'’s impossible to restore.
- Clearly you haven'’t met
our resident geniuses.

30:28.304 --> 30:30.176
Okay, move out.

30:36.878 --> 30:37.748
Felix?

30:40.360 --> 30:42.710
I'’m sorry.
I can'’t seem to focus.

30:42.710 --> 30:45.756
Understandable.
Take some time.

30:45.756 --> 30:48.759
- I can send Griff.
- No, having a task
to distract me

30:48.759 --> 30:51.371
would be helpful.

30:51.371 --> 30:54.374
See if Ark 3'’s
weapons locker is intact.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.593
Um, a lot of stuff'’s
probably stored

30:56.593 --> 30:59.031
in different places
on our ark.

30:59.031 --> 31:01.076
I might be some help,
if you want me to go.

31:01.076 --> 31:03.339
Are you sure you want
to go back over there?

31:03.339 --> 31:05.602
I mean, I wouldn'’t want to.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.953
I actually think
it might give me
some kind of closure.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.693
Okay.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.070
The armory is this way.

32:25.073 --> 32:26.683
- There you are.
- Aren'’t you supposed to be

32:26.683 --> 32:29.034
going through
crew personal effects?

32:29.034 --> 32:31.036
I was, and look what I found.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.089
My sword.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.440
I knew you'’d want it.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.966
- Robert was bringing it to me.
- I guess so.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.969
I knew you really treasured
this old thing,

32:50.969 --> 32:52.274
so I had to bring it
right to you.

32:52.274 --> 32:53.972
Thank you.

32:59.803 --> 33:04.112
I trained with this every day
most of my life.

33:12.468 --> 33:13.295
Let'’s do our job.

33:15.732 --> 33:19.519
- Pharmaceuticals.
- What?

33:19.519 --> 33:21.695
From Ark 3'’s med bay.
Where do you want them?

33:21.695 --> 33:24.089
Uh, on my desk is fine.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.637
- This is damaged.
- I tried to break in.

33:50.637 --> 33:55.337
Everyone did,
but none of us
had the clearance.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.296
Security isn'’t
a division of GSA.

33:57.296 --> 33:59.820
My code should work
across all arks.

34:15.792 --> 34:18.795
I'’m kind of glad
we didn'’t get this open.

34:18.795 --> 34:21.407
Probably would
have made things worse.

34:21.407 --> 34:26.020
I never understood
why they would have guns
on ships in space.

34:26.020 --> 34:30.198
I mean, for what?
To defend against who exactly?

34:46.867 --> 34:50.566
- Kelly?
- I'’m sorry, Felix.

34:50.566 --> 34:53.003
I lied.

34:53.003 --> 34:54.831
I didn'’t want you
to hurt more,

34:54.831 --> 34:58.531
but I think you should know.

34:58.531 --> 35:01.577
What?

35:01.577 --> 35:04.885
Your daughter.

35:04.885 --> 35:07.627
Robert told me about her once.

35:07.627 --> 35:11.761
They were at the market the day
global food rationing began.

35:11.761 --> 35:15.025
It turned into a riot and...

35:19.421 --> 35:20.814
...and she took a stray bullet.

35:27.821 --> 35:31.216
I'’m sorry.
I should have told you.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.653
- I--
- It'’s better to know.

35:46.274 --> 35:48.711
Projectile weapons
have no place in space.

35:48.711 --> 35:52.324
One bullet through the hull
could depressurize a whole ship.

35:52.324 --> 35:53.890
Or kill an innocent child.

36:08.818 --> 36:12.909
I agree.
I won'’t tell anyone.

36:28.751 --> 36:30.797
That'’s the eighth hull camera
with corrupted video.

36:30.797 --> 36:33.930
- How many more
do we have to check?
- 107.

36:33.930 --> 36:36.411
The good news
is that there is video.

36:36.411 --> 36:39.153
When our ark got hit,
the EM pulse knocked out
all our cameras.

36:39.153 --> 36:40.676
Ark 3'’s cams must have
had better shielding.

36:40.676 --> 36:42.722
I'’ll create an algorithm
to sort out files

36:42.722 --> 36:44.332
that register as corrupted.

36:44.332 --> 36:46.334
I wish you could create
an algorithm to sort through

36:46.334 --> 36:48.075
a damaged video
and pull out the bad frames.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.557
Why didn'’t you say that
20 minutes ago?

36:53.341 --> 36:55.082
Because I just thought of it.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.606
The hull cameras record
at 60 frames per second.

36:57.606 --> 36:59.521
The damaged video
is 30 seconds.

36:59.521 --> 37:02.089
- So 60 times 30 is--
- 1,800 frames.

37:03.743 --> 37:05.135
According to the sensors,

37:05.135 --> 37:07.181
the EM pulsed
every 20 seconds.

37:07.181 --> 37:10.402
Okay, so if you create
a program to cut out
every 60th frame...

37:10.402 --> 37:12.665
We'’ll be left
with a playable video.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.710
- It'’ll skip a frame
here or there, but so what?
- Yeah, that'’s fine.

37:14.710 --> 37:17.147
- Okay.
- Hey, you'’re quick
with numbers.

37:17.147 --> 37:20.194
Horticulture'’s
a lot of chemistry.

37:20.194 --> 37:23.197
Chemistry requires
a lot of math.

37:23.197 --> 37:26.505
But look at you,
you'’re creating a computer
program on the fly.

37:26.505 --> 37:28.768
The AI writes the program.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.204
I just tell it what
I want it to do.

37:30.204 --> 37:32.598
Now I'’m applying it
to the video to render.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.210
Is there anything
you can'’t do?

37:38.386 --> 37:42.521
Um, well, I--
I can'’t keep plants alive.

37:42.521 --> 37:46.742
I'’m a-- what's the opposite
of a green thumb?

37:46.742 --> 37:50.224
- A numb thumb.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'’m that.

37:50.224 --> 37:52.313
Well, anyone
can be a green thumb
with a little help.

37:52.313 --> 37:53.706
That'’ll be nice.

37:53.706 --> 37:57.013
- I'’m in. Oh, I mean...
- Oh, you--

37:57.013 --> 37:58.319
...if you were
offering to show me.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.756
I mean, no, I wasn'’t,

38:00.756 --> 38:02.280
but I am now.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.152
Yeah, sure.

38:30.046 --> 38:34.007
The hull on that
attacking ship said...

38:34.007 --> 38:35.400
Ark 15?

38:37.227 --> 38:38.620
That'’s who attacked us?

38:49.022 --> 38:50.153
So, that'’s it?

38:50.153 --> 38:53.853
That little thing there,
that'’s--

38:53.853 --> 38:56.856
that'’s gonna help us
get faster than light?

38:56.856 --> 39:00.338
According to Alicia
and that girl from this ship.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.428
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

39:03.428 --> 39:05.168
Did you not read the sign?

39:05.168 --> 39:07.910
That'’s for dummies like you.
I know what I'’m doing.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.706
It'’s functional.

39:26.276 --> 39:28.322
Eva, do you know
what this means?

39:28.322 --> 39:29.628
It means there'’s
actually a chance

39:29.628 --> 39:32.370
that I might step
foot on Proxima B.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.893
I mean, assuming, you know,

39:33.893 --> 39:35.329
that you can
actually figure out

39:35.329 --> 39:37.679
how to make this
thingy work, that is.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.115
Do you doubt me?

39:41.291 --> 39:43.337
Never.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.093
I told you to read
the bleedin'’ sign.

40:11.626 --> 40:16.283
- Damn it! We'’re trapped.
- What'’s going on over there?

40:16.283 --> 40:17.806
We'’re getting reports
of a lockdown.

40:17.806 --> 40:19.634
I think I tripped
a fail-safe.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.596
What the hell
are we counting down to?

40:24.596 --> 40:26.336
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy?

40:26.336 --> 40:27.729
It'’s Ark 3's self-destruct.

40:27.729 --> 40:30.384
It'’s a self-de-what now?
No, no, no, no, no.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.473
Come on, why?
Why would it do this?

40:32.473 --> 40:34.127
<i>You ever see anything
like this before?</i>

40:34.127 --> 40:36.434
<i>No.</i>
- Griff, bring me Kelly.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.785
- It wants an abort code.
- Oh, well, that'’s very
nice of them.

40:39.785 --> 40:42.396
Just give us one
last-minute chance to try
and save ourselves.

40:42.396 --> 40:44.703
It waited until there
was no time to hack it.

40:44.703 --> 40:48.489
- Here she is.
- Is this another one
of your booby traps?

40:48.489 --> 40:50.535
- This isn'’t me, I swear.
- Then what is it?

40:50.535 --> 40:52.406
- I don'’t know.
- What do you mean
you don'’t know?

40:52.406 --> 40:54.582
You said you worked
in Engineering.

40:54.582 --> 40:56.454
You didn'’t know there
was a self-destruct
on the retrofit?

40:56.454 --> 40:59.108
No, I swear, but it does
kind of make sense.

40:59.108 --> 41:02.808
The Maddox retrofit
is the most valuable piece
of tech in the universe.

41:05.158 --> 41:07.029
Who'’d want to steal it?

41:07.029 --> 41:08.466
Well, isn'’t that exactly
what we'’re doing?

41:12.861 --> 41:14.907
I'’m accessing
Captain Lester'’s files now.

41:14.907 --> 41:16.909
Maybe there'’s
some kind of command code
in here that could help.

41:16.909 --> 41:19.694
- <i>Angus, Alicia--</i>
- Already on it.

41:19.694 --> 41:21.870
We'’re looking through
Captain Bishop'’s files.

41:21.870 --> 41:24.220
This is my fault.

41:24.220 --> 41:27.920
Listen to me.
This is not your fault, right?

41:27.920 --> 41:29.835
You just did
what you came here to do.

41:37.059 --> 41:39.845
You know, all of a sudden,

41:39.845 --> 41:42.195
I'’m not ready to go.

41:51.247 --> 41:53.032
<i>I have a code!
I have a code! Are you ready?</i>

41:53.032 --> 41:55.861
- What? How?
- <i>Just try it!</i>

41:55.861 --> 41:57.732
<i>03-11,</i>

41:57.732 --> 41:59.299
<i>02-11,</i>

41:59.299 --> 42:02.432
<i>12-22-06-06.</i>

42:06.654 --> 42:07.525
It worked.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.016
Well done, Lane.

42:22.583 --> 42:23.453
Lane?

42:28.458 --> 42:31.505
Thank you, Mr. Trust.

42:31.505 --> 42:33.899
Your backdoor code has
just saved a lot of lives.

42:35.291 --> 42:39.252
I'’ve just got two questions.

42:39.252 --> 42:40.688
Where the hell am I?

42:43.256 --> 42:44.866
And why?
