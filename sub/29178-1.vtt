01:52.039 --> 01:53.908
[female newscaster] <i>Police are
making a plea for information</i>

01:54.041 --> 01:56.176
<i>for 24-year-old student
Alison Woods...</i>

01:56.309 --> 01:58.878
[man] <i>My daughter, Sarah
Collins, vanished nine days ago.</i>

01:59.012 --> 02:00.780
<i>It's not like her
to go wandering off.</i>

02:00.914 --> 02:02.316
[female newscaster 2]
<i>Emily Phillips was last seen</i>

02:02.450 --> 02:04.085
<i>leaving her gym
on the corner of...</i>

02:04.218 --> 02:05.987
[female newscaster 3]
<i>She may have met someone online.</i>

02:06.120 --> 02:07.821
[woman] <i>I know she's
out there somewhere.</i>

02:07.954 --> 02:09.923

[dog barking]

02:19.433 --> 02:21.802
[distant chatter]

02:23.371 --> 02:25.106
You don't tell me
what to do in this house.

02:25.239 --> 02:27.342
This is my house.
These are my rules!

02:27.476 --> 02:30.177
[girl] You're the baby 'cause
you went through my stuff!

02:30.311 --> 02:33.147
[sighs] How many times have I
asked you to use the doorbell?

02:33.280 --> 02:34.882
[girl] I'll be ready
in a minute, Dad.

02:35.016 --> 02:37.185
Mom snooped through
my social media.

02:37.585 --> 02:38.954
You have no right
to do that.

02:39.087 --> 02:40.655
I have every right
to do that, young lady.

02:40.789 --> 02:42.623
- You should've asked her first.
- [girl] See?

02:42.757 --> 02:44.925
Would you like to see the photos
your daughter's posting of herself?

02:45.059 --> 02:49.197
Or the conversations she's having
with complete and total strangers?

02:50.832 --> 02:54.602
[girl] It's nothing compared to the
naked selfies Kim and Kylie post.

02:56.938 --> 02:58.907
Sorry, Dad.
I'll take it down.

03:00.242 --> 03:02.644
- I'm ready for school.
- Sit down.

03:07.816 --> 03:10.018
Now, show me these people
you've been talking to.

03:10.420 --> 03:11.920
You mean, boys?

03:13.021 --> 03:14.623
You can talk to boys.

03:15.590 --> 03:17.226
Boys are gonna try
and talk to you.

03:19.361 --> 03:22.165
I didn't accept their friend requests.
Some of them messaged me, though.

03:22.298 --> 03:25.168
- And you replied?
- They were being so annoying.

03:25.301 --> 03:28.304
They were baiting you.
And you fell for it.

03:29.205 --> 03:32.442
Assess the situation like I taught
you how to do in the real world.

03:33.409 --> 03:36.446
Malcolm here.
All of his photos are by himself.

03:36.579 --> 03:39.115
And look at his camera angles.
He's trying to make it look

03:39.248 --> 03:41.118
like someone else
is taking the picture.

03:42.251 --> 03:44.320
And all of his friends
are girls.

03:46.456 --> 03:48.091
Do you get his MO Now?

03:50.394 --> 03:51.328
Men are...

03:51.462 --> 03:53.964
Pigs. I know.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.099
Can we go to school now?

03:58.868 --> 04:00.337
Yeah. Get your stuff.

04:02.172 --> 04:05.876
[man] Think of it like a...
a roller coaster.

04:06.742 --> 04:10.347
You'll be nervous
to start with.

04:10.481 --> 04:12.615
Even scared a little.

04:13.984 --> 04:18.921
But once you get started,
uh, the rush you feel...

04:19.055 --> 04:20.891
Thanks for my phone,
by the way.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.129
That's a secret phone,
remember?

04:46.351 --> 04:50.455
So, why don't we start by each
taking off a piece of our clothes?

04:50.589 --> 04:52.290
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

05:01.467 --> 05:02.468
Sexy.

05:02.601 --> 05:04.336
[chuckles] Really?

05:05.004 --> 05:06.271
No, dickhead.

05:07.071 --> 05:08.306
[grunts]

05:11.709 --> 05:14.712
[police radio chattering]

05:30.196 --> 05:33.132
The driver found her when
he unloaded the cargo.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.068
Female, Caucasian,
thirties.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.372
There's multiple breaks.
Left arm, both legs.

05:39.838 --> 05:41.907
- Jumper?
- I'd say so.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.043
She didn't die on impact,
but given her injuries

05:44.176 --> 05:46.045
and the temperature,
shortly after.

05:47.780 --> 05:51.418
I'd estimate she landed from
a height of over 15 feet.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.098
Ask the driver
if he stopped for gas.

06:05.765 --> 06:08.335
Then check the bridges
along his route.

06:09.169 --> 06:12.072
They might have CCTV
or security cameras.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.875
She major cartilage damage on her wrists
and calcified bruising on the bone.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.844
- She was tied up.
- Looks like it.

06:17.977 --> 06:21.114
She was also given vitamin
supplements and birth control.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.651
Whoever did this
blew her eardrums out,

06:23.783 --> 06:25.353
but her cranium
was still intact.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.722
The lab thinks it was some
kind of pressurized device.

06:27.854 --> 06:29.423
Have you ID'd her yet?

06:29.557 --> 06:34.328
No. Whoever did this took a
lot of patience and dedication.

06:34.462 --> 06:38.699
And, uh, if we're lucky,
it's a lone case of infatuation.

06:38.833 --> 06:43.271
Yeah. And if we're not, it's a guy who
wants his guests to be permanent residents.

06:50.111 --> 06:53.282
Hey! My gosh.
How are you?

06:56.350 --> 06:58.152
Okay. Um...

06:58.286 --> 07:00.187
So I'm guessing
you work cyber now.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.957
- I gave up the lounge chair.
- Hmm.

07:03.091 --> 07:06.327
I'm a profiler now. I guide their
interactions with suspects online...

07:06.460 --> 07:09.030
I can't get into this interface.
It's not working.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.632
Just grab this code trail,
lock onto it.

07:10.766 --> 07:12.301
It's a really delicate gig,

07:12.434 --> 07:14.403
trying to coerce someone
into revealing an agenda

07:14.536 --> 07:16.338
without pushing them
into one.

07:16.471 --> 07:17.506
[man] Um, Rachel?

07:18.239 --> 07:20.742
Pardon, sorry.
Your boy is back.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.110
Okay.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.279
All right.

07:25.547 --> 07:28.418
Look, listen, I need some people checked
out on my daughter's social media.

07:28.551 --> 07:31.653
Oh, that's good. You're in touch.
That's really good.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.223
- And Angie... how is she?
- Just what I asked for.

07:36.358 --> 07:37.427
Thank you.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.869
- [man] He seems nice.
- [Rachel sighs]

07:56.111 --> 07:57.946
[music playing
through headphones]

07:58.080 --> 07:59.649
[door closes]

07:59.782 --> 08:01.517
What the fuck is this?

08:03.853 --> 08:05.188
Who are you?

08:07.357 --> 08:10.159
Listen, I... I haven't
done anything wrong.

08:12.028 --> 08:13.731
Ninety-four girls groomed.

08:13.863 --> 08:16.400
Looks like you met with thirteen of
them, had sex with four.

08:16.533 --> 08:20.838
- Is this one more?
- I never... I never forced any of them.

08:20.970 --> 08:23.807
There's little difference between
forcing yourself on someone

08:23.940 --> 08:26.176
and influencing a girl
into submission.

08:26.310 --> 08:28.479
[gasps] What the fuck?
I can't feel my...

08:28.612 --> 08:31.648
$92,000 in savings,
another $8,000 in stocks.

08:31.782 --> 08:36.320
I'll get... I'll get help.
I'll... I'll go to therapy.

08:36.453 --> 08:39.490
Oh, you don't need that anymore.
It doesn't work anyway.

08:39.624 --> 08:42.024
As highlighted
by your previous conviction.

08:42.860 --> 08:45.562
Jesus fucking Christ.
What have you done to me?

08:45.696 --> 08:46.764
Sign this.

08:47.498 --> 08:50.300
Your savings will be divided
amongst the girls you abused.

08:53.238 --> 08:54.872
[pills rattle]

08:55.272 --> 08:58.142
Take one twice a day
for the rest of your life.

08:58.275 --> 09:00.010
It's a testosterone
suppressant.

09:00.144 --> 09:01.979
Your doctor will
prescribe it for you.

09:02.112 --> 09:03.381
What's happening to me?

09:03.515 --> 09:05.650
I've disarmed you.
It's still there.

09:05.784 --> 09:09.086
But it's now no longer possible
for you to get an erection.

09:09.219 --> 09:10.488
I've also had
your balls removed.

09:10.622 --> 09:13.358
Not that you had any...
in the first place.

09:14.159 --> 09:17.762
If you inform the police
of your rehabilitation,

09:17.896 --> 09:22.534
I will release the images you have
poorly hidden on your computer

09:22.667 --> 09:25.571
to your entire address book.

09:25.704 --> 09:28.340
Do I make myself clear?

09:31.142 --> 09:34.412
[police radio chattering]

09:52.766 --> 09:54.667
Why this one?

09:54.800 --> 09:58.571
It's isolated. It's a long way on
foot in the cold from either side.

09:59.672 --> 10:01.173
If she was being chased...

10:03.810 --> 10:05.345
jumping was the only option.

10:12.017 --> 10:14.019
I won't get much off this.

10:25.966 --> 10:27.234
It should still be hot.

10:27.367 --> 10:29.069
Oh, you got
the bread I like.

10:30.035 --> 10:32.706
We need to get some proper
furniture for this place.

10:33.573 --> 10:36.243
You want somewhere nice to sit?
I'll get you a sofa.

10:36.376 --> 10:37.477
No, I meant for you.

10:37.611 --> 10:39.379
There's sheets over everything.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.281
It's just weird.
It's a house. You sit down.

10:41.415 --> 10:42.782
These are for you.

10:45.485 --> 10:47.855
- No, these are nice.
- There's a transmitter in them.

10:47.989 --> 10:49.256
Okay, that's so nice.

10:49.389 --> 10:52.058
The emit a signal that
feeds off cell phones.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.195
As long as you're near one,
I'll be able to track you.

10:58.466 --> 11:01.335
Do you have to use that one?
I look so rough.

11:01.469 --> 11:04.205
Hey, you want to help me
a second with this? I got...

11:06.707 --> 11:09.877
- Where's my file?
- Uh, Rachel took it.

11:10.011 --> 11:12.981
She wanted to go over it.
Give it a personal touch.

11:13.114 --> 11:15.283
- Yeah.
- And where is she?

11:15.416 --> 11:18.051
- She's at lunch.
- At lunch?

11:18.184 --> 11:19.787
Yeah, she eats.

11:19.921 --> 11:21.689
[baby babbling]

11:21.822 --> 11:23.357
Is that your baby?

11:24.258 --> 11:25.527
Yeah.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.596
You bring your baby
to work?

11:28.129 --> 11:31.566
When my girl
can't have her, yes.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.036
And what...
[sighs]

11:34.168 --> 11:35.671
Fuck it.

11:37.506 --> 11:38.907
You could've said something.

11:39.042 --> 11:40.342
What was I supposed to do?

11:40.475 --> 11:42.343
You could've said something.

11:47.616 --> 11:50.252
[sirens blaring]

11:54.322 --> 11:56.692
Didn't you move in,
like, a year ago?

12:01.064 --> 12:03.399
No wonder you wouldn't
let me come over.

12:03.533 --> 12:07.736
Yeah. But it works for me.
No one says it has to be pretty.

12:07.869 --> 12:09.072
Mom does.

12:09.204 --> 12:10.640
I do what I do.

12:11.373 --> 12:12.609
You do what you do.

12:12.742 --> 12:14.310
I do pizza.

12:33.563 --> 12:35.598
I told you, you don't want
to spend time here.

12:36.867 --> 12:39.202
Don't you want
a proper home again?

12:39.335 --> 12:41.604
I just want to shower
and get back to work.

12:47.410 --> 12:50.213
[water running]

13:06.897 --> 13:10.567
He ain't coming. I'm bored.
I want to go home. Come get me.

13:13.772 --> 13:16.675
Okay, now I'm actually
ready to leave. Thank you.

13:16.808 --> 13:17.841
Okay.

13:20.177 --> 13:22.546
So, you've been here
a while.

13:22.914 --> 13:24.716
Where's your pa?

13:25.050 --> 13:26.283
In jail.

13:29.853 --> 13:33.290
You should stand up straight. You got
some great, hefty tits. Show them off.

13:53.311 --> 13:54.579
There was
a young girl in here.

13:54.713 --> 13:56.081
That foul-mouthed
little thing?

13:56.247 --> 13:57.716
That'd be her.

13:58.450 --> 13:59.819
She left already.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.857
[beeping]

14:05.924 --> 14:07.258
[engine starts]

14:14.633 --> 14:16.736
[beeping continues]

14:18.570 --> 14:20.673
[tires screeching]

14:23.176 --> 14:24.410
[horn honking]

14:28.447 --> 14:30.783
[horn honking, tires screeching]

14:34.520 --> 14:36.288
[horn honking]

14:48.568 --> 14:50.170
Are you all right?

14:50.303 --> 14:53.040
- Are you okay?
- Move the car!

14:53.174 --> 14:54.707
Get out of the way!
Move your car!

14:54.841 --> 14:57.376
- You're in shock!
- Move your fucking car!

14:57.511 --> 15:00.013
- It's okay.
- [grunting]

15:01.182 --> 15:03.985
Help! Somebody help!

15:04.118 --> 15:06.052
- [sirens blaring]
- Please!

15:06.186 --> 15:07.821
- Please!
- Oh, fuck.

15:07.954 --> 15:11.691
He pushed me aside.
Must be drunk or something.

15:11.825 --> 15:14.762
Sir. Out of
the vehicle, please.

15:17.964 --> 15:20.834
He is running hundreds
of open profiles.

15:20.968 --> 15:23.704
It's all wired to upgrade
automatically,

15:23.838 --> 15:25.873
but he's barely using half
of its capabilities.

15:26.007 --> 15:28.177
If anything,
he's a self-taught techie.

15:28.309 --> 15:29.543
Why do I recognize him?

15:29.676 --> 15:32.579
He was a judge.
And a good one.

15:32.713 --> 15:34.549
He handled a lot of
our criminal cases.

15:34.682 --> 15:36.751
And he stepped down when
his family was murdered.

15:36.884 --> 15:39.821
[Rachel] My colleagues have some
questions about the equipment in your car.

15:39.955 --> 15:42.723
- There's a young girl out there, been abducted.
- Yes.

15:42.857 --> 15:47.461
He says that he's fitted a girl with
a tracker and he's using her as bait.

15:47.595 --> 15:50.666
The signal went dead
right about here.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.467
It was moving
when we lost it.

15:54.168 --> 15:57.638
Her very life is on the line
right now, right this second.

15:57.772 --> 15:59.574
And here we are, talking!

16:01.076 --> 16:03.779

40:43.363 --> 40:45.198
But there's more than one of him in there.
That's the point.

40:45.331 --> 40:47.233
I have his mother's
case file.

40:49.369 --> 40:53.339
Amy Stulls, born 1962.
Committed suicide, 1995.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.475
You're chasing ghosts.

40:55.608 --> 40:57.910
[woman] While working overtime
in the textile factory,

40:58.044 --> 41:01.448
mother was abducted
and raped in 1986.

41:01.881 --> 41:03.450
Tossed into a lake.

41:03.584 --> 41:06.252
She survived to become
pregnant with Simon.

41:08.187 --> 41:10.257
What's the address
of that textile factory?

41:18.931 --> 41:20.300
- Okay.
- [door closes]

41:21.033 --> 41:22.970
[woman] They found
a suicide note.

41:27.575 --> 41:28.941
[Rachel] Zoom in.

41:31.211 --> 41:34.181
"Rejoice, rejoice.

41:35.282 --> 41:38.152
Judas's whore is dead.

41:40.287 --> 41:43.190
Come, servants.
Feed on my feet.

41:45.125 --> 41:48.163
The fire, the ice.

41:49.731 --> 41:52.065
The creeper who raped me.

41:53.333 --> 41:56.337
His blood money
I let silence me.

41:58.139 --> 41:59.974
Shame on you all.

42:00.642 --> 42:02.010
Shame.

42:03.912 --> 42:05.480
I hate you.

42:06.079 --> 42:07.582
I love you.

42:09.919 --> 42:14.356
I tried to hide us,
but the devil sees everything.

42:16.191 --> 42:18.560
My evil, evil boy.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.831
My sweet, sweet boy.

42:21.963 --> 42:23.998
Mommy's so sorry.

42:26.035 --> 42:28.203
This winterbug is free."

42:31.540 --> 42:33.676
[metal clangs]

42:58.502 --> 42:59.636
[thud]

43:05.976 --> 43:07.777
[truck engine idling]

43:34.539 --> 43:35.673
[slurping]

43:38.276 --> 43:40.011
So, like, will it hurt?

43:40.143 --> 43:44.047
[chuckles]
No. Don't be silly.

43:52.690 --> 43:54.625
- Where's Cooper?
- Hey, man.

43:54.759 --> 43:56.527
Oh, fucking ball-sacs.

43:56.661 --> 43:59.998
I... I was... I was
just being a friend.

44:00.164 --> 44:01.667
I need Cooper.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.001
He can hear you.

44:03.868 --> 44:06.270
I'm sorry, okay?
I just want to go.

44:07.204 --> 44:11.577
Put those on
or I will let them castrate you.

44:16.280 --> 44:17.715
[man chuckles nervously]

44:45.778 --> 44:48.881
[sighs] I'm not surprised
by what you're up against.

44:49.015 --> 44:51.717
Predators may act in solitary,

44:51.850 --> 44:54.553
but their instincts
are quite the opposite.

44:54.686 --> 44:58.658
They take comfort in knowing that there are
others out there just like them, all alone.

44:58.791 --> 45:00.893
Please, continue to enlighten me
on the nature of criminals.

45:01.027 --> 45:02.896
Well, it's the reason
your men are dying, isn't it?

45:04.864 --> 45:06.766
Simon's got friends.

45:07.900 --> 45:09.435
[doorbell rings]

45:11.771 --> 45:13.874
[ringing]

45:15.708 --> 45:16.743
Hi.

45:17.209 --> 45:18.277
What are you cunts
doing here?

45:18.411 --> 45:20.580
That is not nice. We...

45:22.682 --> 45:26.353
For the record, I have
no legal right or claim

45:26.487 --> 45:28.254
over anything
on this property.

45:28.388 --> 45:31.391
You guys are here illegally,
and now anything you find on that computer

45:31.524 --> 45:33.861
is inadmissible
in a court of law.

45:33.994 --> 45:36.563
- Shit.
- Yeah. Fucktards.

45:38.265 --> 45:39.500
Hey, what's he doing, anyway?

45:40.100 --> 45:43.202
I'm hacking Simon's
virtual drive

45:43.336 --> 45:45.372
from what it thinks
is a trusted source

45:45.506 --> 45:47.241
through
to the exchange.

45:47.975 --> 45:49.176
Why are you helping him?

45:49.643 --> 45:50.979
Because he never tried
to fuck me,

45:51.112 --> 45:52.412
and wouldn't, if he could.

45:53.013 --> 45:54.948
He's decent. Most men
are fucking gross.

45:55.082 --> 45:56.283
Not all men
are gross.

45:56.417 --> 45:57.651
Oh, yours isn't?

45:58.385 --> 45:59.687
No, mine is.

46:01.156 --> 46:03.257
- [beeps]
- [man] I'm in.

46:06.493 --> 46:08.763
Who are you?

46:08.897 --> 46:11.866
How many cases have you worked
where guilt is obvious

46:12.000 --> 46:13.668
but the jury had to ignore
a piece of evidence?

46:13.802 --> 46:16.837
Like a rapist who buys
his way out of a case.

46:16.971 --> 46:20.875
Suddenly someone has the courage
to refuse his offer to pay her off.

46:21.976 --> 46:23.344
Prosecutes.

46:24.446 --> 46:26.514
Jury will never hear
what he's done before.

46:26.648 --> 46:28.883
Doesn't really give you
the right to run around,

46:29.017 --> 46:30.752
hacking people's nuts off,
though, does it?

46:30.885 --> 46:34.622
If a lion eats someone
and you lock it up

46:34.756 --> 46:36.892
and you say,
"Don't do that again,"

46:37.026 --> 46:39.260
then ten years later,
you let it out, what happens?

46:39.395 --> 46:40.929
Not all criminals
are animals.

46:41.062 --> 46:42.098
Some are wired to be.

46:42.764 --> 46:45.433
Eighty percent of sex offenders re-offend.
Eighty percent.

46:45.567 --> 46:49.038
Yet we knowingly let them
back out onto the street.

46:49.171 --> 46:52.841
Seven this last month released
within 15 miles of this school.

46:52.975 --> 46:56.011
That's five out of seven
active predators.

46:56.645 --> 46:57.980
Unless you treat
the underlying cause

46:58.114 --> 47:00.716
of their instinct
to offend: Hormones.

47:00.850 --> 47:05.420
When you do that, the re-offend
rate drops to just five percent.

47:05.554 --> 47:07.690
You can't think someone's
gonna commit a crime

47:07.823 --> 47:10.392
regardless of any of
the social factors,

47:10.526 --> 47:13.663
because that is
dangerously narrow-minded.

47:13.797 --> 47:15.631
It's like thinking
all Muslims are terrorists.

47:15.765 --> 47:17.633
I'm not talking about
the color of a man's skin.

47:17.767 --> 47:21.270
I'm talking about the endless
voice in a predator's head

47:21.403 --> 47:23.874
that says,
"Do it, do it, do it."

47:28.944 --> 47:31.280
You're too stubborn
to ask why.

47:34.484 --> 47:36.887
I know why.
You think you got punished

47:37.020 --> 47:39.422
for letting all those
sex offenders out of prison.

47:43.894 --> 47:45.729
What happened
to your family...

47:46.897 --> 47:48.166
was a tragedy.

47:48.900 --> 47:51.500
And no matter how many
predators you treat...

47:53.270 --> 47:54.871
that guilty you're feeling...

47:58.441 --> 47:59.877
it never goes away.

48:14.392 --> 48:18.696
We hacked his server. He was talking
to someone called Hunter. Hunter71.

48:18.830 --> 48:22.834
Explosive in the car was pentaerythritol
tetranitrate. Commonly used.

48:22.967 --> 48:25.304
However, the compounds
in the trigger are unique.

48:25.436 --> 48:28.673
High-intensity, stable,
low surrounding impact, and dense.

48:28.806 --> 48:30.808
Expensive. Military grade.

48:30.942 --> 48:34.246
Simon said that Santa comes and drops
money off at the house every year.

48:34.378 --> 48:36.148
Maybe Santa pays
the bomb maker.

48:36.281 --> 48:39.684
Run a search for military
personnel in the state,

48:40.184 --> 48:41.652
born 1971.

48:44.089 --> 48:46.625
Okay. Which one of those
are trained in explosives?

48:48.060 --> 48:49.661
No longer in service.

49:11.951 --> 49:14.687
- [gunshot]
- He's hit! Shots fired!

49:15.255 --> 49:16.989
Pop smoke!

49:17.990 --> 49:19.259
[gunfire]

49:19.391 --> 49:21.560
[indistinct shouting]

49:25.698 --> 49:27.733
[shouting continues]

49:38.811 --> 49:41.180
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Turn around!

49:41.314 --> 49:43.016
Stay back! Stay back!

49:44.117 --> 49:45.585
Wait!

49:49.356 --> 49:51.091
We both know
why you're here.

49:53.626 --> 49:57.730
You sold a trigger explosive to a man who
abducted and killed more than ten women.

49:58.631 --> 50:01.635
- What?
- Don't you have a fucking newspaper?

50:05.471 --> 50:06.606
What else
did you make him?

50:06.739 --> 50:10.444
Uh, a signal blocker
for cell phones.

50:10.577 --> 50:11.812
It was nothing.

50:13.047 --> 50:14.249
[sighs]

50:15.050 --> 50:17.952
That was the guy who
locked up all those women?

50:18.518 --> 50:20.521
Yeah. Someone out there
has been...

50:20.654 --> 50:21.889
[gunshot]

50:32.434 --> 50:33.734
[sighs]

50:49.951 --> 50:51.752
[sniffs]

50:59.228 --> 51:00.729
Tell me about your mommy.

51:03.732 --> 51:05.133
Tell me about her.

51:07.569 --> 51:09.071
I bet she hated you.

51:14.577 --> 51:16.678
She loved me.
She protected me.

51:17.279 --> 51:18.981
Protected you from what?

51:19.949 --> 51:23.352
She didn't take care of you.
She didn't love you.

51:23.919 --> 51:25.888
- You...
- No one loves you.

51:26.655 --> 51:28.823
No one. You have nobody.

51:28.958 --> 51:30.993
- No.
- You have nobody to keep you company...

51:31.127 --> 51:32.595
- No.
- ...except your reflection.

51:32.728 --> 51:34.196
You're a freak.

51:34.331 --> 51:36.966
Where's the other Simon?
I want to talk to him.

51:37.100 --> 51:40.503
- Rachel, don't.
- Come on. Come on.

51:40.636 --> 51:42.805
- What is it? You like tits?
- No.

51:42.938 --> 51:44.573
- You like to chain women up?
- No.

51:44.707 --> 51:46.109
Yes, you do. Come on.

51:46.243 --> 51:47.710
- Come on, Simon.
- Don't do that.

51:47.844 --> 51:49.312
Come on!
What did she do to you?

51:49.446 --> 51:50.647
- [buzzing]
- Come on!

51:50.781 --> 51:51.847
- Tell me what she did to you!
- No.

51:51.981 --> 51:53.283
- Tell me.
- Rachel, no.

51:53.417 --> 51:55.851
What? What did she
do to you? Tell me!

51:55.986 --> 51:57.620
- Come on!
- She never let me play!

51:57.754 --> 51:59.823
She always kept me
locked in a cage

51:59.956 --> 52:02.360
like a monkey!
Like a monkey!

52:02.493 --> 52:04.693
What did you do to her?
What did you do to your mom?

52:04.827 --> 52:06.830
- [buzzing continues]
- They made me.

52:06.963 --> 52:09.699
- They told me to do it.
- Who's they?

52:09.833 --> 52:11.335
- They told me...
- Who's they?

52:11.469 --> 52:13.171
- They told me to.
- Who's they?

52:13.304 --> 52:14.539
They told...

52:15.439 --> 52:17.474
- Fuck me! Who's they? Who's they?
- [screaming]

52:17.607 --> 52:19.342
Who's they?
The voices in your head?

52:19.477 --> 52:22.547
Tell me who it is!
I want to talk to the other Simon!

52:22.679 --> 52:24.215
I want to talk
to the man!

52:24.916 --> 52:28.385
I am the man!
I do what I want!

52:28.852 --> 52:30.620
Do you remember all the women
that you killed?

52:30.754 --> 52:33.858
I remember them.
I remember them.

52:33.991 --> 52:35.159
Who was the first one?

52:35.293 --> 52:36.562
[screams]

52:37.128 --> 52:39.930
I hate him.
He follows me everywhere!

52:40.063 --> 52:42.066
- Who's he?
- [screams]

52:42.200 --> 52:44.035
[gasping]

52:44.168 --> 52:46.003
[coughing]

52:58.716 --> 53:01.787
This arrived for you upstairs.
I signed for it.

53:01.920 --> 53:04.255
- You know, give you a break.
- Thank you.

53:04.755 --> 53:05.857
You okay?

53:05.990 --> 53:07.892
Yeah, it's just been
a long day.

53:08.659 --> 53:11.029
So, you want to go
get some ribs?

53:14.766 --> 53:16.401
Baby, I'm ready to take her.

53:17.869 --> 53:21.273
Baby? Are you sleeping?

53:22.040 --> 53:23.075
Hey.

53:23.610 --> 53:24.544
Hey.

53:24.676 --> 53:26.678
[moaning softly]

53:35.288 --> 53:36.688
Marshall.

53:39.124 --> 53:43.028
[child laughing on a loop]

53:49.402 --> 53:50.571
Everyone get out!

53:50.703 --> 53:52.704
[police radio chattering]

54:13.760 --> 54:16.095
You know,
I have to yell at people

54:16.229 --> 54:18.031
to get them to do
what I want.

54:18.398 --> 54:19.466
You don't.

54:22.536 --> 54:23.671
What are you doing here?

54:24.672 --> 54:26.941
It's freezing cold and it's
the middle of the night.

54:27.073 --> 54:30.311
You don't...
Well, I know you don't want to be here.

54:30.444 --> 54:31.844
[chuckles]

54:32.745 --> 54:34.348
I despise downtown.

54:35.549 --> 54:38.919
My wife used to chastise me
because I never took any, so...

54:39.886 --> 54:43.924
It just doesn't feel right to put
my feet up where hers should be.

54:44.693 --> 54:46.060
You know what I mean?

54:48.963 --> 54:50.498
I'm used to seeing you
look like shit.

54:50.632 --> 54:52.833
You look, like,
almost normal.

54:52.967 --> 54:54.802
[chuckles] What's going on?

54:57.871 --> 54:59.207
I'm just...

55:03.712 --> 55:04.945
You know.

55:06.348 --> 55:08.183
[radio dispatcher] <i>Bomb threat at
the police station. Everyone evac.</i>

55:08.316 --> 55:10.518
- <i>I repeat, everyone evac.</i>
- Shit.

55:12.287 --> 55:14.322
[sirens blaring]

55:23.832 --> 55:24.899
[alarm blaring]

55:25.033 --> 55:26.835
Whoa, whoa, we gotta go.
Come on.

55:27.369 --> 55:28.903
[man] Gotta get out! Let's go!

55:29.037 --> 55:31.773
[indistinct shouting]

55:44.052 --> 55:45.421
[Simon gasps]

55:46.956 --> 55:48.257
[door buzzes]

55:51.159 --> 55:54.063
Put this shit on.
Put it on.

55:54.730 --> 55:56.065
[door locks]

55:57.967 --> 55:59.536
[laughing]

56:01.471 --> 56:03.838
I got you. I got you.

56:03.973 --> 56:06.108
[laughing]

56:07.577 --> 56:08.679
I got you!

56:08.811 --> 56:10.547
- Shut up.
- I got you!

56:13.083 --> 56:15.484
Rachel, where is he?

56:16.319 --> 56:17.521
In his cell.

56:17.987 --> 56:19.523
That package was from you.

56:22.359 --> 56:24.027
[laughing]

56:26.996 --> 56:30.267
He's not gonna blow himself up.
This is bullshit.

56:30.400 --> 56:33.036
- Why wouldn't he?
- Because then the game is over.

56:33.303 --> 56:37.207

Come here.

58:46.172 --> 58:48.209
[girl] Since when
do you cook?

58:49.043 --> 58:50.811
I used to cook
for your mother all the time.

58:51.544 --> 58:53.112
I just haven't had
a reason to.

58:55.114 --> 58:57.084
I mean, do you do
your hair all nice

58:57.218 --> 58:58.686

to look at it?

58:58.819 --> 59:00.354
Yes.

59:01.422 --> 59:02.857
That's a bad example.

59:03.256 --> 59:04.425
This is gluten-free,
right?

59:04.558 --> 59:05.926
'Cause I'm

59:06.059 --> 59:08.662
[laughs] No, you're not.

59:14.902 --> 59:16.203
What's going on?

59:22.176 --> 59:24.044
When your mother and I
had you,

59:24.546 --> 59:27.481
she was very nervous
about my job.

59:27.983 --> 59:29.618
SWAT is dangerous.

59:30.217 --> 59:31.753
So I moved to Homicide.

59:32.219 --> 59:33.522
It was quieter.

59:36.391 --> 59:39.193
But with you around,
everything became personal.

59:42.230 --> 59:44.332
Where I couldn't
afford it to be.

59:46.769 --> 59:48.203
I tried everything.

59:49.639 --> 59:51.071
Even therapy.

59:52.407 --> 59:55.277
[scoffs] Can you imagine me
in therapy?

59:55.845 --> 59:57.145
You hate talking.

01:00:04.219 --> 01:00:07.289
So you were worried something
bad would happen to me?

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:08.758
No.

01:00:09.659 --> 01:00:11.060
Actually...

01:00:13.931 --> 01:00:15.263
I just couldn't...

01:00:16.532 --> 01:00:18.401
I couldn't see it anymore.

01:00:25.576 --> 01:00:27.543
You know when you're
in bed at night

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.679
and the lights are off,

01:00:30.212 --> 01:00:31.848
you can see the room, right?

01:00:32.783 --> 01:00:35.151
Then if you turn the lights
on and off again,

01:00:35.886 --> 01:00:37.354
you can't see anything.

01:00:39.221 --> 01:00:41.123
The people I chase...

01:00:42.425 --> 01:00:44.126
they live in the dark.

01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:49.132
And I could see them really
easily until you came along.

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:55.806
Because...

01:00:57.374 --> 01:00:58.675
you were the light.

01:01:50.928 --> 01:01:53.665
No phones or laptops
till you come get us.

01:01:54.066 --> 01:01:56.669
I get it. It's okay, Dad.

01:02:03.408 --> 01:02:04.777

01:02:15.353 --> 01:02:16.622
[door closes]

01:02:22.695 --> 01:02:24.531
[Rachel] Simon's mother
was suicidal.

01:02:24.664 --> 01:02:27.099
After the rape and pregnancy,
she must've seen a psychiatrist.

01:02:27.232 --> 01:02:29.735
[Marshall] That doesn't matter. All the
files of the rape charges have been buried.

01:02:29.868 --> 01:02:31.738
Not these. The state has
strict indemnity clauses

01:02:31.871 --> 01:02:34.841
to protect itself in the event
a patient commits suicide.

01:02:40.345 --> 01:02:44.718
Records at crisis centers across
the state get backed up annually.

01:02:45.418 --> 01:02:47.320
Simon wouldn't know that.

01:02:48.388 --> 01:02:49.790
Nobody would.

01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:51.991
Waste of fucking time.

01:02:54.194 --> 01:02:56.997
It's Marshall. I need two teams down
at the psychiatric record center.

01:02:57.131 --> 01:02:59.232
There is a corridor
filled with crap down here.

01:02:59.365 --> 01:03:00.601
[Rachel] Got it.

01:03:02.936 --> 01:03:03.970
Okay. Hold on that.
