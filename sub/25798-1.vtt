01:09.951 --> 01:12.853
- Follow me. We're almost there.
- Where are we going?

01:12.855 --> 01:15.889
- To help Max with his stakeout.
- Yes!

01:15.891 --> 01:18.624
Ooh!
This is incredible.

01:18.626 --> 01:20.594
Are you sure it's
going down at the docks?

01:20.596 --> 01:21.994
Oh, yeah.

01:21.996 --> 01:24.865
- The coolest things always go down at the docks.
- Ohh!

01:24.867 --> 01:26.866
And occasionally abandoned warehouses.

01:26.868 --> 01:28.802
And this place has both.

01:28.804 --> 01:30.871
Are you sure
it hasn't started yet?

01:30.873 --> 01:32.942
I do not want to
miss a thing.

01:34.075 --> 01:36.008
- There he is.
- Ooh!

01:36.010 --> 01:38.645
Max. NYPD.

01:38.647 --> 01:40.613
The toughest cop
on the force.

01:40.615 --> 01:42.582
Oh, not tonight, guys.

01:42.584 --> 01:44.050
Ooh, he's alone.

01:44.052 --> 01:45.651
You bet he's alone,
Midge.

01:45.653 --> 01:46.952
He always works alone.

01:46.954 --> 01:48.922
Hey, guys...
My bad.

01:48.924 --> 01:51.157
- Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:51.159 --> 01:53.192
Max is on a stakeout.

01:53.194 --> 01:56.829
- His badge is on the line.
- What? My badge is not on the line.

01:56.831 --> 01:58.999
You want us to
watch your six, Maxi?

01:59.001 --> 02:00.866
No. Do you even know
what "six" means?

02:00.868 --> 02:03.169
Yeah, it's how many
fingers I have.

02:03.171 --> 02:05.604
Ohh! Can you make him stop?

02:05.606 --> 02:06.909
Quiet. Do you hear that?

02:08.576 --> 02:10.977
Bad-guy boat.

02:10.979 --> 02:14.714
Pigeon PD, assume
undercover identities.

02:17.085 --> 02:18.984
- S-Sorry.
- What is happening?

02:18.986 --> 02:20.423
Come to papa.

02:25.526 --> 02:29.161
If you need backup, Max, the
Pigeon PD is ready for action.

02:30.699 --> 02:32.899
I don't need backup.

02:32.901 --> 02:35.000
I'm taking these smugglers down.

02:35.002 --> 02:36.068
Solo.

02:39.007 --> 02:40.207
It's starting.

02:40.209 --> 02:41.711
Finally.

02:42.844 --> 02:44.177
Yo, Samson, check the dock.

02:48.050 --> 02:49.615
Mastiff.

02:49.617 --> 02:52.687
I knew I smelled bad attitude.

03:02.865 --> 03:05.468
Shh!

03:07.703 --> 03:09.835
We've got Ling Li.
Come on in.

03:09.837 --> 03:11.637
Ling Li, shh.

03:11.639 --> 03:14.006
My name is Max,
and I promise you,

03:14.008 --> 03:18.078
me and the NYPD are gonna get
you home safe to your mama.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.613
You're going to be okay.

03:19.615 --> 03:20.883
I promise you that.

03:23.852 --> 03:26.052
<i>Suspected buyers
on the move. Hold your positions.</i>

03:30.192 --> 03:31.760
Get back in the vehicle.

03:44.139 --> 03:45.475
The money's all here,
guv'nor.

03:49.110 --> 03:50.744
Wet-Nap?

03:50.746 --> 03:51.848
Lavender scented?

03:56.251 --> 03:57.784
It's go time.

03:57.786 --> 04:00.754
Time to play dead, cop.

04:00.756 --> 04:02.155
I don't know that trick.

04:02.157 --> 04:04.791
Let me teach you!

04:04.793 --> 04:06.760
Hope you can doggy paddle.

04:08.663 --> 04:10.630
- Oh!
- And the judges say?

04:10.632 --> 04:12.232
- 6.0.
- Ohh!

04:12.234 --> 04:14.768
He can flip this bird
any day.

04:14.770 --> 04:16.939
What is Max doing? He's just
supposed to be on lookout.

04:19.141 --> 04:21.774
- Freeze! Get your hands where I can see them!
- Not on my watch.

04:21.776 --> 04:24.176
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

04:25.947 --> 04:27.947
I'm the good guy, you idiot.

04:29.651 --> 04:31.151
<i>Do not endanger the panda.</i>

04:31.153 --> 04:32.822
<i>Repeat.
Do not endanger the panda.</i>

04:35.290 --> 04:37.690
Fake beard?

04:37.692 --> 04:38.858
NYPD.

04:38.860 --> 04:41.127
This is an FBI operation.

04:41.129 --> 04:44.798
FBI? I think I would have
gotten a memo about that.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.231
- Heading eastbound on foot.
- Stand down.

04:46.233 --> 04:48.134
- This is my bust.
- We're blown.

04:48.136 --> 04:50.070
- <i>What happened?</i>
- Some rogue police dog.

04:50.072 --> 04:53.707
Yeah, I'm pretending to know
what's going on right now.

04:53.709 --> 04:55.108
Okay, so Max,
the cop,

04:55.110 --> 04:57.010
he pulled off the beard
of the FBI agent,

04:57.012 --> 04:58.678
but, oh, you know,
that is not good.

05:00.281 --> 05:01.716
<i>♪ Uh ♪</i>

05:02.617 --> 05:04.250
Oh, no, no.

05:04.252 --> 05:06.620
Nice doggy. No.

05:06.622 --> 05:07.889
Whoa!

05:08.656 --> 05:09.625
Whoa!

05:10.225 --> 05:11.992
Dang feds.

05:11.994 --> 05:13.959
- Someone ought to put a leash on you.
- Oh, yeah?

05:13.961 --> 05:15.260
Well, let's see 'em try.

05:15.262 --> 05:17.130
<i>♪ Baby, maybe you can get it ♪</i>

05:17.132 --> 05:19.798
<i>♪ If you've got that thing

05:19.800 --> 05:21.336
You runnin' like a wiener dog.

05:23.004 --> 05:24.606
Ha ha! Yes!

05:27.942 --> 05:30.346
You just been recycled.

05:32.247 --> 05:34.750
I'm gonna neuter
that mongrel.

05:36.384 --> 05:38.284
2-8-7.
I need a car.

05:38.286 --> 05:39.918
I need a...

05:39.920 --> 05:41.223
<i>♪ Give it to me ♪</i>

05:47.696 --> 05:49.031

Oh, no.

05:49.898 --> 05:51.865
Ow!

05:51.867 --> 05:53.365
Yeah, what's the matter, buddy?

05:53.367 --> 05:56.168
Dogs can't jump fences?
Boo-yah!

05:56.170 --> 05:58.238
You play defense.

06:00.041 --> 06:02.074
I play open fence.

06:02.076 --> 06:03.843
You gotta be kidding me.

06:05.180 --> 06:07.813
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:07.815 --> 06:09.348
Um, good doggy,
good doggy.

06:09.350 --> 06:12.786
Oh, I'm good, all right. Good
at taking a bite out of crime.

06:12.788 --> 06:15.255
You and I should have a little talk.
My name's Petey.

06:15.257 --> 06:17.289
- What's your name? Who let the dogs out?
- Where's that panda?

06:17.291 --> 06:19.661
Literally, who let
them out?

06:21.262 --> 06:23.163
This fool again?

06:23.165 --> 06:24.634
Whoa.

06:28.002 --> 06:29.269
Hey!

06:29.271 --> 06:31.103
Freeze! FBI!

06:31.105 --> 06:33.038
Okay, all right. No, no, no.
Take it easy.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.908
Spin around.

06:34.910 --> 06:36.108
Here we go.
All right.

06:36.110 --> 06:37.444
All right, take it easy,
Magnum PI.

06:37.446 --> 06:39.144
I'm gonna take it easy.

06:39.146 --> 06:42.014
This fed's been a pain
in my butt all night.

06:42.016 --> 06:44.918
Time for a little hair
of the dog.

06:52.494 --> 06:55.295
This is a huge... Where is our panda?
Where is our panda?

06:55.297 --> 06:58.130
And I might have rabies,
so thank you, NYPD.

06:58.132 --> 07:01.800
We're sorry, agent. It's not like
Max to attack a fellow officer.

07:01.802 --> 07:04.137
That dog has anger issues.
Look at his eyes.

07:04.139 --> 07:05.437
He needs therapy.

07:05.439 --> 07:06.740
Dog therapy?

07:06.742 --> 07:08.408
I don't know.

07:08.410 --> 07:11.043
I'm not an expert in canine mental
disorders. I'm an FBI agent.

07:11.045 --> 07:14.382
This dude is just asking
to be my next chew toy.

07:15.884 --> 07:18.918
This panda sting was
an FBI investigation.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.385
What was that dog doing there?

07:20.387 --> 07:22.154
Max is part of our team.

07:22.156 --> 07:23.957
Your team should have
been doing their job,

07:23.959 --> 07:25.791
not interfering with
our investigation.

07:25.793 --> 07:28.394
Hey, calm down, Sarge.

07:28.396 --> 07:30.897
Hoooow'd you
let this happen?

07:30.899 --> 07:32.397
You know that wasn't my fault.

07:32.399 --> 07:35.200
That panda needs to be back
at the zoo with her mother.

07:35.202 --> 07:37.137
She's only eight weeks old.

07:37.139 --> 07:39.772
...of a 12... of a 12...

07:39.774 --> 07:41.307
I know-ow-ow.

07:41.309 --> 07:43.175
Wait a second.
Now you got me doing it.

07:43.177 --> 07:45.043
Why are there dogs
in this meeting?

07:45.045 --> 07:46.512
They are some of
New York's finest.

07:46.514 --> 07:48.248
What is happening
in this town?

07:48.250 --> 07:50.216
Contraband entering
New York ports

07:50.218 --> 07:51.918
comes under NYPD jurisdiction.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.553
Ling Li is not mere
contraband.

07:53.555 --> 07:56.456
Her kidnapping from China and
transportation to this country

07:56.458 --> 07:58.091
is an international crime.

07:58.093 --> 08:00.293
I hope you have better luck
solving this international crime

08:00.295 --> 08:01.527
than you had with the others.

08:01.529 --> 08:04.096
Didn't you feds somehow
blow a sting operation

08:04.098 --> 08:06.966
involving a pygmy
three-toed sloth in Panama?

08:06.968 --> 08:11.271
And what about the Bengal tiger who was
kidnapped just last week in Singapore?

08:11.273 --> 08:13.272
Oh, and don't forget
the albino python.

08:13.274 --> 08:16.911
I'll have you know that that
sloth was very fleet of foot.

08:19.380 --> 08:21.313
For a sloth.

08:21.315 --> 08:23.217
We're done here.

08:24.249 --> 08:25.551
It was a very fast sloth.

08:25.553 --> 08:28.454
Sarge, you just gonna roll over
and let the FBI take our case?

08:28.456 --> 08:31.089
Oh, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

08:31.091 --> 08:33.592
In this business you gotta
know your place sometimes.

08:33.595 --> 08:35.027
Oh, thank you, Chief.

08:35.029 --> 08:37.095
Oh, okay. Well, enjoy.

08:37.097 --> 08:38.530
But somebody's gotta do
something.

08:38.533 --> 08:40.532
Be right there, Maxi.
A little to the left.

08:40.534 --> 08:42.070
A little to the left.
Bingo!

08:45.105 --> 08:46.605
Hey, hey, Max.
How you doing?

08:46.607 --> 08:49.275
- What's up, Rico? Bob.
- Yo, big dog.

08:49.277 --> 08:50.443
Hey, Sparky.

08:50.445 --> 08:52.277
Hey, Max.

08:52.279 --> 08:53.445
Where'd they put
my suspect?

08:53.447 --> 08:56.916
Interrogation room 2, huh.

08:56.918 --> 08:59.118
- You and I got a big problem.
- Do you know this song?

08:59.120 --> 09:02.188
It's called... <i>♪ You got nothing
on me You got nothing on... ♪</i>

09:02.190 --> 09:03.857
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

09:03.859 --> 09:06.258
'Cause I'm pretty sure
I saw you with a stolen panda.

09:06.260 --> 09:07.594
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on.

09:07.596 --> 09:10.063
- Who's to say it was a stolen panda?
- Come again?

09:10.065 --> 09:12.031
I'm just saying that
in my experience,

09:12.033 --> 09:14.132
illegal pandas look
a lot like legal pandas.

09:14.134 --> 09:16.035
- You get them mixed up.
- Okay, smart guy.

09:16.037 --> 09:18.171
So if the panda wasn't hot,
how come you were running?

09:18.173 --> 09:20.873
Well, because there was a vicious
dog chasing me. Next question.

09:20.875 --> 09:23.108
How about you and I
have a respectful conversation?

09:23.110 --> 09:25.344
- This is painful.
- How about we order in some lunch?

09:25.346 --> 09:28.580
Huh? Is this an interrogation
or a first date?

09:28.582 --> 09:32.218
Fine. You want to see bad cop,
I'll show you bad cop.

09:32.220 --> 09:34.387
Well, I...
Listen, a hint.

09:34.389 --> 09:36.321
Good cop, bad cop works
a lot better with two people.

09:36.323 --> 09:39.191
What are you,
the spinny Lego head guy?

09:39.193 --> 09:41.361
What do you know about it?

09:41.363 --> 09:43.028
- Oh.
- All right, look.

09:43.030 --> 09:45.931
Oh! This is ludicrous.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.967
- This moron is getting played.
- Here comes bad cop.

09:47.969 --> 09:49.334
- Sparky?
- Ahh!

09:49.336 --> 09:51.371
- Get the lights.
- You got it, Max.

09:51.373 --> 09:54.007
...cheese-flavored nacho

09:54.009 --> 09:55.941
till you tell me where that panda is!

09:55.943 --> 09:57.609
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't hurt me.

09:57.611 --> 09:59.112
- Don't hurt me.
- All right.

09:59.114 --> 10:00.379
Now we're getting somewhere.

10:00.381 --> 10:03.315
Who are you working for and
what's the location of the panda?

10:03.317 --> 10:05.951
- He's shaking in his boots, Max.
- I got no names, no nothing.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.121
But I did overhear
something about a show.

10:08.123 --> 10:10.156
- Show him some teeth.
- What show?

10:10.158 --> 10:11.456
A dog show.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.092
- A dog show.
- Dog show?

10:13.094 --> 10:14.259
They said
if the deal goes south,

10:14.261 --> 10:15.460
they're gonna try
and sell the panda.

10:15.462 --> 10:17.329
It's working!

10:17.331 --> 10:19.031
The Canini Invitational.

10:19.033 --> 10:21.066
Keep it coming.

10:21.068 --> 10:23.569
It's in Vegas. At Caesars, tomorrow night.
That is all I know.

10:23.571 --> 10:26.104
All right.

10:26.106 --> 10:27.706
And scene.

10:27.708 --> 10:30.642
- Good work, agent.
- What?

10:30.644 --> 10:32.578
- Thanks, Chief.
- It makes sense.

10:32.580 --> 10:35.547
The Canini Invitational is the
world's most prestigious dog show.

10:35.549 --> 10:39.618
Celebrities, tech titans, huh?
Chinese billionaires.

10:39.620 --> 10:42.321
Plenty of people with the cash
to stock their own private zoos.

10:42.323 --> 10:46.492
So they're using the dog show
as a front for animal smuggling.

10:46.494 --> 10:48.695
All right. Well, get me on
the next flight to Vegas.

10:48.697 --> 10:50.329
- I'll take care of the rest.
- Whoa.

10:50.331 --> 10:52.531
You can't let this idiot
take my case.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.367
They should send me.
Tell 'em, Sarge.

10:54.369 --> 10:57.737
I'm on it, Max.

10:57.739 --> 10:59.671
You know what? I'm gonna
need a new identity though

10:59.673 --> 11:02.208
- if I wanna get access to that show.
- Who needs some "wuv" there?

11:02.210 --> 11:04.042
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, Max.

11:04.044 --> 11:05.677
I tried.

11:05.679 --> 11:07.613
What if you were a contestant?

11:07.615 --> 11:10.083
- A contestant?
- Oh, yeah, baby.

11:10.085 --> 11:11.517
- Yeah.
- What are you thinking, Max?

11:11.519 --> 11:15.088
Watch this. The chief is
about to have a great idea.

11:15.090 --> 11:16.524
With a dog?

11:18.058 --> 11:19.459
Wait.
I just had a great idea.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.627
You could enter Max
in the show.

11:21.629 --> 11:23.128
What about droopy over here?

11:23.130 --> 11:25.330
No, no, sorry.
The sergeant...

11:25.332 --> 11:26.999
Are you nuts, Max?

11:27.001 --> 11:29.368
You're a street dog
with a temper.

11:29.370 --> 11:31.237
What do you know
about dog shows?

11:31.239 --> 11:35.208
I made a promise to a scared little
panda, and I aim to keep it.

11:35.210 --> 11:37.776
Who knows where this dog's
gonna bite me next?

11:37.778 --> 11:40.613
- Deal with it.
- Besides, how hard can dog shows be?

11:40.615 --> 11:42.116
I'll just google it.

11:48.423 --> 11:52.124

Are you doing this

12:17.451 --> 12:19.084
After five hours
in a travel crate,

12:19.086 --> 12:21.353
we're listening
to <i>my</i> music.

12:21.355 --> 12:22.622
Will you stop?
Max, stop it.

12:22.624 --> 12:23.790
That... No, no.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.657
- <i>♪ Ho ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Viva ♪</i>

12:27.062 --> 12:28.297

12:33.100 --> 12:35.200
<i>♪ I give props to hip-hop ♪</i>

12:35.202 --> 12:38.307
Boy, this guy really
doesn't like hip-hop.

12:40.741 --> 12:43.376
Look, clearly we got off
on the wrong foot, okay?

12:43.378 --> 12:46.145
I-I-I...
We should be friends.

12:46.147 --> 12:47.713
We should be best friends.

12:47.715 --> 12:49.184
You're a dog. I'm a man.

12:50.784 --> 12:52.286
Here.

12:58.158 --> 13:00.193
Go on.
Go fetch.

13:00.195 --> 13:02.161
Fetch? Fetch?

13:02.163 --> 13:04.397
You gotta learn
something about me, okay?

13:04.399 --> 13:06.364
I don't play
the dog-and-master bull.

13:06.366 --> 13:07.566
What...

13:07.568 --> 13:09.435
You want a best friend,
get a labradoodle.

13:09.437 --> 13:10.505
'Cause I ain't interested.

13:12.740 --> 13:14.339
- Where are you going?
- I'm sorry.

13:14.341 --> 13:17.109
But I got real police work to do.

13:17.111 --> 13:18.176
Bad dog.

13:18.178 --> 13:19.311
Heel.

13:19.313 --> 13:20.546
Heel yourself, chump.

13:20.548 --> 13:22.214
Stupid human.

13:22.216 --> 13:23.217
Stupid dog.

13:36.530 --> 13:38.864
<i>Welcome, Canini competitors.</i>

13:38.866 --> 13:42.734

- Agent Nichols.

13:47.475 --> 13:49.242
FBI.

13:49.244 --> 13:50.345
Come on in.

13:53.914 --> 13:55.248
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:55.250 --> 13:57.150
- I'm Mattie Smith.
- Oh, wow.

13:57.152 --> 13:59.151
You're the Bureau's
canine consultant?

13:59.153 --> 14:04.323
I-I was expecting more
of a cat lady type, you know.

14:04.325 --> 14:06.392
Oh, sorry to disappoint.

14:06.394 --> 14:07.727
No, I...

14:07.729 --> 14:08.864
Don't...

14:10.831 --> 14:11.866
No dog smell, huh?

14:13.567 --> 14:15.501
I mean, no,
it's-it's impressive,

14:15.503 --> 14:18.470
you know, with the fluffing
and the folding and...

14:18.472 --> 14:19.875
So did you wanna
just bring him in?

14:21.442 --> 14:23.910
- Him?
- The dog. The rottweiler.

14:23.912 --> 14:25.611
Am I not speaking English?

14:25.613 --> 14:26.945
- Am I barking or something?
- Oh!

14:26.947 --> 14:28.814
Yeah, no, um...

14:28.816 --> 14:32.551
Yeah, the thing is with that,
he, um... kind of ran off.

14:32.553 --> 14:33.920
He ran off?

14:33.922 --> 14:35.588
- Is he lost? Is he okay?
- No, he's not like...

14:35.590 --> 14:37.857
Not like that. He's
dysfunctional, all right.

14:37.859 --> 14:39.658
Anyway, I was kind of
hoping that maybe you have,

14:39.660 --> 14:41.893
like, an extra dog
that I could borrow or...

14:41.895 --> 14:45.498
Oh, uh, I misunderstood.
So you actually came here...

14:45.500 --> 14:47.333
- You wanna borrow a dog?
- That'd be great.

14:47.335 --> 14:50.302
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Did you want that fluffed or folded?

14:50.304 --> 14:52.371
'Cause I have
both in the back.

14:52.373 --> 14:54.706
Right. Look, it would
just be for a couple of days.

14:54.708 --> 14:58.710
Maybe you could point me towards
sort of, like, a rent-a-dog service?

14:58.712 --> 15:01.446
Look, Agent Nichols,
I really just don't think

15:01.448 --> 15:04.684
you're cut out for working with
animals, so there's the door.

15:04.686 --> 15:07.788
- Look, I'm really in a bind here.
- Good luck on your case.

15:09.624 --> 15:11.326
- Thank you for your time.
- Good luck.

15:12.961 --> 15:14.596
Rent-a-dog? Nope.

15:18.799 --> 15:21.233
- What's happening, Luther?
- Hey, Max.

15:21.235 --> 15:22.300
Hey.

15:22.302 --> 15:23.835
So, hey.

15:23.837 --> 15:25.238
H-Hey, Max.
Hey, hey.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.339
- You find me the guy?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

15:27.341 --> 15:29.874
Like I said. First, I, uh...

15:29.876 --> 15:32.445
I'll take that catnip
you promised.

15:32.447 --> 15:34.546
Cell 614.

15:34.548 --> 15:37.550
He's the real deal, Max.
He told me hisself.

15:37.552 --> 15:39.955
But the dude is a wash-up.
He's useless.

15:43.991 --> 15:45.657
Hey, this ain't catnip.

15:47.461 --> 15:49.527
Nah, it's better for you.
Now, get out of here.

15:49.529 --> 15:50.863
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

15:50.865 --> 15:52.732
It's showtime.

15:57.038 --> 15:58.603
Hey, buddy.

15:58.605 --> 15:59.807
Hey.

16:01.341 --> 16:02.842
Aw, look.

16:02.844 --> 16:05.511
That paw looks hurt
pretty bad.

16:05.513 --> 16:06.648
We'll take good care of you.

16:07.981 --> 16:09.517
Come on, buddy.

16:12.452 --> 16:15.287
All right,
there you go, boy.

16:15.289 --> 16:17.857
Now, look, you just rest up,

16:17.859 --> 16:21.926
and we'll get that paw looked at first
thing in the morning, all right?

16:21.928 --> 16:24.497
And hopefully
we'll find you a new home.

16:41.081 --> 16:45.050
Yo.

16:45.052 --> 16:48.087
I'm looking for a famous show dog.
You Philippe de Fabulous?

16:48.089 --> 16:51.489
Who do I have
the pleasure of smelling?

16:51.491 --> 16:53.693
Max. NYPD.

16:53.695 --> 16:55.895
I'm entering
the Canini Invitational,

16:55.897 --> 16:57.930
and I need an expert like you
to teach me the ropes.

16:57.932 --> 16:59.931
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:59.933 --> 17:02.033
Look into my eyes.

17:02.035 --> 17:03.669
Okay.

17:03.671 --> 17:04.969
Nope.

17:04.971 --> 17:06.905
You do not have
what it takes.

17:06.906 --> 17:07.972
- Sorry.
- What?

17:07.973 --> 17:09.607
Cut the attitude.

17:09.608 --> 17:11.443
I know all about you.

17:11.444 --> 17:14.546
Champion show dog at the top of
your game until one day you...

17:14.548 --> 17:16.981
Got disqualified,

17:16.983 --> 17:21.086
because my breeder used plumpers
and fillers on my growl lines.

17:21.088 --> 17:25.090
- Yeah, and then you went...
- Crazy and attacked the judges. Hmm?

17:25.093 --> 17:29.795
And now, I suppose you think you
can manipulate me into helping you

17:29.797 --> 17:33.699
in a desperate bid
for revenge and redemption.

17:33.701 --> 17:35.066
Oh, actually,
I was just...

17:35.068 --> 17:38.671
You are as cunning as you
are persuasive, Maxwell.

17:38.673 --> 17:41.373
Perhaps you have
what it takes after all.

17:41.375 --> 17:43.709
I shall turn you
into the show dog.

17:43.711 --> 17:45.411
You made the right
choice, gramps.

17:45.413 --> 17:46.644
We shall see.

17:46.646 --> 17:48.713
I cannot polish the turd,

17:48.715 --> 17:51.851
but perhaps we can roll it
in glitter.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.818
I'm-a let that slide.

17:53.820 --> 17:55.856
All right, coach,
so what's our first move?

17:57.724 --> 18:00.625
The opening
night party, of course.

18:00.627 --> 18:04.963
<i>Welcome to the Canini
Invitational opening night gala.</i>

18:04.965 --> 18:08.901
<i>Through these portals pass the
most elite canines in the world.</i>

18:08.903 --> 18:12.771
Here we meet, greet,
and size up the competition.

18:12.773 --> 18:14.539
Yeah, okay,
you do that.

18:14.541 --> 18:16.941
I'll be nosing around
for anything suspicious.

18:16.943 --> 18:20.613
Well, of course, nobody makes
talking dog movies anymore,

18:20.615 --> 18:23.716
so I've been focusing
on my lifestyle brands.

18:23.718 --> 18:25.683
- It's right there. Wellington Upstill.
- Your name is on the list,

18:25.685 --> 18:27.553
but it says you have
a rottweiler.

18:27.555 --> 18:31.590
- So?
- There ain't no dog, no party.

18:31.592 --> 18:32.958
What? Hey!

18:32.960 --> 18:35.094
- Max! Max! Buddy.
- Oh!

18:35.096 --> 18:37.896
Max. That's... That's my dog.
Right there. Hey.

18:37.898 --> 18:39.798
- Something you haven't told me?
- Look, it's me!

18:39.800 --> 18:42.535
Uh, yeah.
I'm an undercover cop.

18:42.537 --> 18:45.171
And Hooch over there is the
idiot human they stuck me with.

18:45.173 --> 18:46.974
Hey, rottweiler.
Is this guy with you?

18:50.478 --> 18:52.444
Hey, why don't you use
that leash on your dog?

18:52.446 --> 18:54.546
Okay, thank you
for the advice.

18:54.548 --> 18:56.782
What is your deal, man?

18:56.784 --> 18:58.817
Where'd you disappear to?
You're jeopardizing my case.

18:58.819 --> 19:00.554
- Just ignore him.
- Wait, you got a dog?

19:02.155 --> 19:04.489
Do dogs have their own dogs?
Is that a thing?

19:04.491 --> 19:06.491
It's all gonna be
about Daisy this year.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.093
Hey, Mattie.
Go, Daisy.

19:08.095 --> 19:09.228
You got it?

19:09.230 --> 19:10.865
Hey, great shoes.

19:20.575 --> 19:23.007
By the way,
Hooch was the dog.

19:23.009 --> 19:24.075
The what now?

19:24.077 --> 19:25.643
Turner and Hooch.

19:25.645 --> 19:28.046
Turner was the cop
and Hooch was the dog.

19:28.048 --> 19:29.547
Poor Beasley.

19:29.549 --> 19:30.949
After playing Hooch,

19:30.951 --> 19:34.119
he was forever typecast
as a slobbering imbecile.

19:34.121 --> 19:36.755
Oh, my God,
you're... you're...

19:36.757 --> 19:38.623
Back from the dead, yes.

19:38.625 --> 19:40.558
Philippe!

19:40.560 --> 19:42.126
I'm your biggest fan.

19:42.128 --> 19:44.162
Oh, well...
And you are?

19:44.164 --> 19:47.732
My name is Buncha Rainbow
Sprinkles Junior III,

19:47.734 --> 19:49.969
but everyone calls me
Sprinkles for short.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.737
Oh, my God.

19:51.739 --> 19:53.939
Who's your friend
with the amazing aroma?

19:53.941 --> 19:56.275
Excuse me. I gotta
check something out.

19:56.277 --> 19:59.777
It's like a kennel mixed
with grease mixed with pizza.

19:59.779 --> 20:01.180
Oh! I figured it out.

20:01.182 --> 20:03.548
- You're from New York, aren't you?
- Hey.

20:03.550 --> 20:04.917
Me too. Oh, man!

20:04.919 --> 20:06.084
- Dang.
- We are homeys.

20:06.086 --> 20:08.086
Wellington
Upstill.

20:08.088 --> 20:09.587
Big game hunting mostly,

20:09.589 --> 20:12.892
although, lately I've become
weary of the hunt.

20:12.894 --> 20:15.861
Looking for someone to do the hunt for me.
You know what I mean?

20:15.863 --> 20:18.730
Small exotic bears
from the Middle Kingdom?

20:18.732 --> 20:21.534
Pretty black and white,
if you catch my drift.

20:21.536 --> 20:23.268
Suspicious? Heck, ya!

20:23.270 --> 20:26.604
Someone raided the minibar last
night and I swear it wasn't me.

20:26.606 --> 20:29.107
Philippe, is that you?

20:29.109 --> 20:32.044
<i>Mon Dieu,</i> Daisy.
You look ravishing.

20:32.046 --> 20:34.947
There were two doggy chocolates
on my pillow instead of three.

20:34.949 --> 20:36.649
- Yo.
- ...the circuit for five years.

20:36.651 --> 20:40.151
Oh. This is my student, Maxwell.

20:40.153 --> 20:41.987
- Hey.
- Maxwell, huh?

20:41.989 --> 20:44.155
I don't think
I've seen you before.

20:44.157 --> 20:45.591
Are you new to dog shows?

20:45.593 --> 20:46.725
Are you kidding?

20:46.727 --> 20:49.161
I mean, I been around the block,

20:49.163 --> 20:53.731
you know, and not on a leash,
if you catch my drift.

20:53.733 --> 20:56.869
I mean, if you were comparing me
with the other dogs,

20:56.871 --> 20:59.037
I wouldn't come up lacking,
let's just say that.

20:59.039 --> 21:01.574
Hey.

21:01.576 --> 21:03.275
Okay.

21:03.277 --> 21:05.978
That's an impressive résumé.

21:05.980 --> 21:07.746
Good luck, Philippe.
I'm really glad you're back.

21:07.748 --> 21:09.213
Wow.

21:09.215 --> 21:12.151
She's gorgeous. I bet she
cleans up at this thing.

21:12.153 --> 21:13.419
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

21:13.421 --> 21:16.822
<i>Canini Invitational's
reigning Best in Show winners,</i>

21:16.824 --> 21:19.959
<i>Chauncey Middleton and Dante.</i>

21:19.961 --> 21:21.059
- Hello, hello.
- Who's that?

21:21.061 --> 21:22.961
That is, uh...

21:22.963 --> 21:24.698
Oh, that's Dante.
He's really cool.

21:25.766 --> 21:27.536
He's won every show since...

21:28.736 --> 21:30.702
basically since
Philippe went crazy.

21:30.704 --> 21:34.105
Oh, man, that was hilarious.

21:34.107 --> 21:36.074
Y-You know,
Shouldn't you be locked up?

21:36.076 --> 21:36.912
Thank you.

21:38.746 --> 21:40.379
Is that my
little Philippe?

21:40.381 --> 21:43.015
You traitor!

21:43.017 --> 21:45.918
Ouch.
Get off, you mutt.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.853
That is so Philippe.

21:50.958 --> 21:54.226
Hey, grandpa,
you do not bite my person.

21:54.228 --> 21:57.997
Your person stole my dreams
and ruined my life.

21:57.999 --> 22:00.632
You abandoned me!

22:00.634 --> 22:02.735
- You abandoned me.
- Come, Dante.

22:02.737 --> 22:04.836
This dog is in desperate need
of some training.

22:04.838 --> 22:06.771
Or better yet to be
"put to sleep."

22:06.773 --> 22:08.073
What did you
say to him?

22:09.844 --> 22:11.110
Let it go.

22:11.112 --> 22:13.178
This competition is of
no consequence

22:13.180 --> 22:15.680
in the grand
scheme of existence.

22:15.682 --> 22:19.284
"You only lose what you
cling to." Aristotle.

22:19.286 --> 22:22.821
Deep. Hey, why does that
dog need a bodyguard?

22:22.823 --> 22:25.891
Karma is worth more
than a million dollars.

22:25.893 --> 22:29.193
There have been
disappearances in the past.

22:29.195 --> 22:30.429
Hmm?

22:30.431 --> 22:33.332
Maybe it's not only
the panda they're after.

22:33.334 --> 22:35.834
I'm just looking for a panda.
I need a panda.

22:35.836 --> 22:37.670
Gosh, is it hot in here
or is it me?

22:37.672 --> 22:39.138
Is it hot? Are you hot? I'm hot.

22:39.140 --> 22:42.306
A lot more where that came from.
Not a lot, I mean, but some.

22:42.308 --> 22:43.909
You seem untrustworthy.

22:43.911 --> 22:45.276
Do you have any idea

22:45.278 --> 22:48.146
where I might find something
in a bear, Chinese?

22:48.148 --> 22:50.716
The cure for cancer
lies within them.

22:50.718 --> 22:52.151
Oh. Good.

22:52.153 --> 22:55.690
Just got in a new shipment
of unmarked bills.

22:57.124 --> 23:00.359
You sound like you know
the true value of...

23:00.361 --> 23:03.696
rare animals,
Mr. Upstill, is it?

23:03.698 --> 23:05.430
Yes, well,
like I always say,

23:05.432 --> 23:07.132
if you can't kill
and mount it,

23:07.134 --> 23:08.801
might as well
collect and breed it.

23:08.803 --> 23:10.071
Yes, yes.

23:11.971 --> 23:15.774
Would you like to come to a
little party tomorrow night?

23:15.776 --> 23:18.943
It's in a warehouse
on the outskirts of town.

23:18.945 --> 23:21.915
I think you'll find exactly
what you are looking for.

23:22.817 --> 23:23.949
Toodles.

23:23.951 --> 23:25.286
I have a phone call to make.

23:31.826 --> 23:33.892
Hello?

23:33.894 --> 23:35.861
Tomorrow night,
is it?

23:35.863 --> 23:37.462
Good.

23:37.464 --> 23:40.732
Well, now you've got me
panda-sitting in a damp warehouse.

23:40.734 --> 23:44.103
I mean, we are in Vegas, and I was
hoping that we could be doing...

23:44.105 --> 23:45.304
Guv'nor?

23:45.306 --> 23:47.038
Guv'nor?

23:52.046 --> 23:54.513
Oi, fluffy.

23:54.515 --> 23:58.316
You and me are expecting some company
at the party tomorrow night.

23:58.318 --> 24:00.919
Some posh buyers are coming over to
take a look at the fancy merchandise.

24:02.923 --> 24:05.490
Meanwhile, I'm stuck here
eating cold pizza

24:05.492 --> 24:08.427
while the boss is hobnobbing
at the bleeding Caesars' pool.

24:08.429 --> 24:10.261
There you are.

24:10.263 --> 24:13.364
You missed it. I did some pretty
good police work over there, so...

24:13.366 --> 24:15.299
Well, good. I see you found your dog.
That's something.

24:15.301 --> 24:17.169
Hi. How's it going? Hi.

24:17.171 --> 24:19.938
Yeah, well, you know,
I am an FBI agent, so...

24:19.940 --> 24:22.173
- Is that papillon with you?
- <i>Enchanté.</i>

24:22.175 --> 24:23.941
Did you borrow it
or something?

24:23.943 --> 24:26.478
No, no, no. He just kind of
came with Max. I don't...

24:26.480 --> 24:29.448
Okay, well, if I'm not mistaken, that
dog is a three-time world champion.

24:29.450 --> 24:30.949
That dog?

24:30.951 --> 24:33.084
You don't know anything
about that dog?

24:33.086 --> 24:35.053
No. What do I know
from dogs?

24:35.055 --> 24:37.956
Okay, look, they told me about this whole
situation with the stolen baby panda,

24:37.958 --> 24:40.926
and I don't know why they'd be trying to
sell her here, but I am happy to help.

24:40.928 --> 24:42.427
Great. Thank you.

24:42.429 --> 24:43.929
But if we're gonna
pull this off,

24:43.931 --> 24:46.230
you need to follow
everything I say.

24:46.232 --> 24:48.065
Okay. I'm kind of
the lead agent on this...

24:48.067 --> 24:50.134
I'm sorry, are you arguing
with me already?

24:50.136 --> 24:53.905
If you wanna look like a real dog handler,
you have to follow everything I say.

24:53.907 --> 24:55.173
Okay.

24:55.175 --> 24:57.176
Tomorrow morning.

24:57.178 --> 24:59.210
Don't be late.

24:59.212 --> 25:00.946
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

25:00.948 --> 25:02.847
This is weird.

25:02.849 --> 25:05.284
Yes. You about to
get trained, boy.

25:10.124 --> 25:11.590
Huh.

25:11.592 --> 25:14.392
Can you believe all this
luxury and excess

25:14.394 --> 25:16.394
just because of
a stupid dog show?

25:16.396 --> 25:18.896
Isn't this wonderful?

25:18.898 --> 25:22.200
The beautiful view,
the Snausage and cheese platter,

25:22.202 --> 25:24.569
the toilette
filled with champagne.

25:24.571 --> 25:26.774
Maybe not champagne.

25:28.142 --> 25:30.007
No, no, no, no.

25:30.009 --> 25:32.346
I don't do animals on the bed.
Come on, get out.

25:34.548 --> 25:37.415
Were you always
wearing that robe?

25:39.252 --> 25:40.419
What are you doing?

25:40.421 --> 25:41.953
I am a dog.

25:41.955 --> 25:43.255
He is human.

25:43.257 --> 25:44.957
This is what nature intended.

25:44.959 --> 25:46.158
Not for me.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.227
Are you sure
you will not join us?

25:48.229 --> 25:50.295
Plenty of room for <i>trois.</i>

25:50.297 --> 25:52.564
No, thanks.
I'm fine on the floor.

25:52.566 --> 25:55.370
Always have been
and always will be.

26:00.974 --> 26:02.509
Oh.

26:04.111 --> 26:07.246
<i>Welcome to
the Canini Invitational,</i>

26:07.248 --> 26:10.285
<i>where we celebrate
these noble creatures.</i>

26:11.919 --> 26:14.419
<i>Only the top 50 dogs
in the world</i>

26:14.421 --> 26:16.857
<i>are invited to compete
in the Canini...</i>

26:18.392 --> 26:22.864
<i>making it the world's most
exclusive canine competition.</i>

26:24.163 --> 26:27.266
<i>And only one will
leave this weekend</i>

26:27.268 --> 26:30.067
<i>as the Canini Invitational's</i>

26:30.069 --> 26:33.441
<i>Best in Show!</i>

26:45.653 --> 26:47.889
Number one!

26:49.056 --> 26:51.055
Yeah, that's right.

26:51.057 --> 26:53.027
Bow to the king.

26:54.595 --> 26:56.961
Did you hear that
Misty got fixed last week?

26:56.963 --> 26:59.163
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

26:59.165 --> 27:00.966
Wait. Butt implants?

27:00.968 --> 27:03.535
Golden retriever?
Not a real golden.

27:03.537 --> 27:05.703
Turns out
he wasn't neutered after all.

27:05.705 --> 27:07.605
Toy boat.
Stay focused, Janice.

27:07.607 --> 27:08.576
Stay focused, Janice.

27:10.611 --> 27:12.944
Are you sure
we in the right place?

27:12.946 --> 27:14.179
<i>Pourquoi?</i>

27:14.181 --> 27:16.213
'Cause seeing all these clowns,

27:16.215 --> 27:19.718
I could have swore we were
backstage at a Cirque du Soleil.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.019
With those jokes,
you will not make many friends.

27:22.021 --> 27:23.220
Excuse me.

27:23.222 --> 27:25.324
I'm not here to make friends.

27:25.326 --> 27:27.592
I'm here to find enemies, okay?

27:27.594 --> 27:30.562
I got 72 hours to make good
on a promise I made.

27:30.564 --> 27:33.664
- Welcome to the Canini, Mr. Upstill.
- Come on, guys.

27:33.666 --> 27:36.168
- So how does this work?
- There are three rounds.

27:36.170 --> 27:38.670
In the first, the dogs compete
against their own breed.

27:38.672 --> 27:40.639
Then, in round two,
all the Best of Breed winners

27:40.641 --> 27:42.341
compete against each other
for Best of Group.

27:42.343 --> 27:44.343
- So what group is he?
- Working.

27:44.345 --> 27:46.044
But he's not going
to win in any group

27:46.046 --> 27:47.979
because he's bow-legged,
roach-backed,

27:47.981 --> 27:50.582
and he smells like
he hasn't been washed in months.

27:50.584 --> 27:52.351
She says that
like it's a bad thing.

27:52.353 --> 27:54.385
Only if you
want to win.

27:54.387 --> 27:56.755
Oh, hi, Philippe.
Uh, Max.

27:56.757 --> 27:58.190
Wait, Mattie's
your owner?

27:58.192 --> 28:00.324
No, no. She's my handler.

28:00.326 --> 28:02.594
Though since we're on the road
40 weeks a year together,

28:02.596 --> 28:04.462
she feels like my big sister.

28:04.464 --> 28:07.565
But most important is the
relationship between handler and dog.

28:07.567 --> 28:10.102
- Is he your handler?
- No. More of an assistant.

28:10.104 --> 28:12.036
Ow. Ow.

28:12.038 --> 28:13.270
Make that a rescue.

28:13.272 --> 28:14.708
So where do we start?

28:16.343 --> 28:17.709
Square one.

28:17.711 --> 28:20.011
- <i>♪ Big girls don't cry ♪</i>
- Whoa.

28:22.215 --> 28:23.481
Watch it, French fry.

28:26.153 --> 28:27.753
- Yeah, okay.
- Open.

28:29.390 --> 28:31.123
- He got you, huh?
- Yeah, he got me.

28:31.125 --> 28:33.057
Scrub it in there.
Good.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.793
- I got this, yeah.
- Keep coming.

28:34.795 --> 28:37.763
- I'm gonna get you clean yet.
- Three, two...

28:40.334 --> 28:43.134
You waited for me to get back here for that, didn't you?

28:43.136 --> 28:44.538
Ooh. My eyes, they burn.

28:46.773 --> 28:49.106
Gotta say,
can't improve on perfection.

28:49.108 --> 28:50.374
What's that?

28:50.376 --> 28:52.276
It's, uh,
bikini wax.

28:52.278 --> 28:55.113
When the judges look under the tail,
it's important they have a clean view.

28:55.115 --> 28:57.649
Well, in that case,
allow me.

28:57.651 --> 28:59.450
- Hey, what's that?
- Oh.

28:59.452 --> 29:01.353
- It looks kind of sticky.
- Um...

29:01.355 --> 29:03.587
- Uh-oh.
- It's payback time.

29:03.589 --> 29:06.490
Hey, wait.
What's he doing back there?

29:06.492 --> 29:08.293
- The pain passes...
- Philippe!

29:08.295 --> 29:09.760
but the beauty, she remains.

29:09.762 --> 29:11.263
Wait. What?

29:18.538 --> 29:21.440
Sorry, pal.

29:21.442 --> 29:23.441
Although you are ready
for beach season.

29:23.443 --> 29:25.110
Uh-huh.
Laugh it up, Frank,

29:25.112 --> 29:27.144
but you best sleep
with one eye open tonight.

29:27.146 --> 29:29.314
All right, Philippe,
let's show them how it's done.

29:29.316 --> 29:32.551
Get your books, Maxwell.
You are about to go to school.

29:32.553 --> 29:35.487
When you're in competition, it's all
about details. Going the extra mile.

29:35.489 --> 29:37.557
<i>Oui.</i> You do not win
by blending in.

29:38.826 --> 29:41.194
You win by being the star.

29:43.630 --> 29:46.297
Max and Frank,
you wanna try?

29:46.299 --> 29:47.665
All right.

29:49.536 --> 29:51.736
Okay, so you don't
wanna mount the dog.

29:51.738 --> 29:54.107
I'm not gonna mount the dog.
I'm gonna put the thing on.

29:55.375 --> 29:56.708
- Okay, be careful.
- I got it.

29:56.710 --> 29:58.876
You and your dog have to be
in sync at all times.

29:58.878 --> 30:00.612
Not in this lifetime.

30:00.614 --> 30:03.448
- Trust each other and move as one.
- All right.

30:03.450 --> 30:05.449
Hey, hey, hey,
Max, hold up.

30:05.451 --> 30:06.617
Hold up.
Just be cool.

30:06.619 --> 30:10.622
Ugh. Whoever bred you needs
to have their license revoked.

30:10.624 --> 30:13.557
What's that, Dante? I know you ain't
talking about my mom and dad.

30:13.559 --> 30:16.728
Hey, everyone. Max thinks
his mom and dad are breeders.

30:16.730 --> 30:17.895
Okay, that's it.

30:17.897 --> 30:19.631
Max.

30:19.633 --> 30:21.565
- Heel. Heel.
- You want me to heel?

30:21.567 --> 30:23.535
- Fine, I'll show you heel.
- Max, quit goofing around.

30:23.537 --> 30:25.836
Hey, let go.
Let go. Whoa!

30:27.875 --> 30:30.574
Down! Stand down, Officer.
Officer, stand down.

30:32.712 --> 30:34.449
...main stage, please.
Rottweilers...

30:35.615 --> 30:36.616
Uh-oh.

30:40.253 --> 30:41.786
This is gonna be hilarious.

30:41.788 --> 30:43.555
Thank you.

30:43.557 --> 30:45.789
- This is how we play.
- Yeah.

30:45.791 --> 30:47.859
Cameras, focus on the new guy.
It's gonna be a top ten.

30:47.861 --> 30:49.460
Thank you.

30:49.462 --> 30:50.895
Corgis.
Congratulations, ma'am.

30:50.897 --> 30:52.697
Rottweilers,
up this way, please.

30:52.699 --> 30:54.932
- Miss Smith, thank you so much for joining us.
- Hi, Larry. Thanks.

30:54.934 --> 30:57.334
New guy.
Mr., uh...

30:57.336 --> 31:00.238
- Upstill.
- You've been put down here where it's safe.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.707
Yeah, sorry about before. We
were just trying a new trick.

31:02.709 --> 31:04.545
Come on, Philippe.

31:06.279 --> 31:08.279
Cassius is a five-time
world champion.

31:08.281 --> 31:10.750
I'm not saying that to scare you or
anything. Guys, good luck, okay?

31:12.318 --> 31:14.451
Do you hear that?
Five-time champion.

31:14.453 --> 31:17.322
If we get knocked out, we'll lose our
access and maybe never find Ling Li.

31:17.324 --> 31:20.959
Hey, man. Can somebody please tell
me why they all look the same?

31:20.961 --> 31:24.362
Most likely because they are
all from the same champion bloodline.

31:24.364 --> 31:25.564
Really?

31:25.566 --> 31:27.298
Like one big family?

31:27.300 --> 31:29.601
Yes, in a sense,
I suppose. Yes.

31:29.603 --> 31:32.269
- Hmm.
- Very good. Mr. Upstill.

31:32.271 --> 31:34.206
Mr. Upstill.

31:34.208 --> 31:35.873
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

31:35.875 --> 31:40.312
<i>please welcome to the arena
that noble breed,</i>

31:40.314 --> 31:43.648
<i>those fearless loyal protectors</i>

31:43.650 --> 31:45.549
<i>the rottweilers.</i>

31:56.430 --> 32:00.368
Returning champion Cassius is
clearly the top dog in this category.

32:01.867 --> 32:04.369
But Hans made a strong showing
last year

32:04.371 --> 32:07.005
and is looking to take the crown
this time around.

32:07.007 --> 32:10.775
All eyes are on the judge as he
calls up the first contestant,

32:10.777 --> 32:12.643
veteran competitor Sadie,

32:12.645 --> 32:13.880
to begin the examination.

32:16.916 --> 32:17.951
Huh.

32:20.886 --> 32:22.519
Hey. Hey.

32:22.521 --> 32:25.390
You guys notice anything
unusual going on?

32:25.392 --> 32:27.691
Hans had some
work done... again,

32:27.693 --> 32:29.995
but there's nothing
unusual about that.

32:29.997 --> 32:33.430
I noticed how unusually hot
Daisy looks this year.

32:33.432 --> 32:35.467
I smell a playdate.

32:35.469 --> 32:38.937
Daisy don't go rotty, and she
certainly don't go for losers.

32:38.939 --> 32:42.641
Has anyone ever told you guys
that you have a real resemblance?

32:42.643 --> 32:43.941
You guys aren't related,
are you?

32:43.943 --> 32:46.378
Course not.
I'm from Tennessee.

32:46.380 --> 32:47.645
And I'm from Chicago.

32:47.647 --> 32:48.979
Originally?

32:48.981 --> 32:51.382
Well, no.
Originally I was adopted.

32:51.384 --> 32:53.985
- Hey, same. Me too.
- You don't say. From where?

32:53.987 --> 32:55.920
- Hopkinsville, Kentucky.
- Hopkinsville, Kentucky.

32:55.922 --> 32:58.590
Hey, I'm from
Hopkinsville too.

32:58.592 --> 33:00.691
Me too, before I moved
to Deutschland.

33:00.693 --> 33:02.760
- Well, when are your birthdays?
- April 19.

33:02.762 --> 33:04.662
April 19.

33:04.664 --> 33:05.796
That means you're...

33:05.798 --> 33:07.465
Brothers!

33:07.467 --> 33:09.534
I once had a litter
in Hopkinsville.

33:09.536 --> 33:11.303
Oh, my God.
Could it be?

33:11.305 --> 33:12.937
Mama!

33:12.939 --> 33:14.338
My puppies!

33:14.340 --> 33:16.507
What did I miss?

33:16.509 --> 33:19.044
Clearly
a disqualifiable offense.

33:19.046 --> 33:20.815
Let's see
what the judges decide.

33:21.781 --> 33:22.913
You're number one.

33:22.915 --> 33:24.349
Oh, yeah.

33:24.351 --> 33:25.749
- And newcomer Max wins.
- What?

33:25.751 --> 33:27.852
Whoo-hoo! Max!
That's my best friend.

33:27.854 --> 33:29.921
- Number one.
- This is unprecedented

33:29.923 --> 33:34.359
in Canini Invitational history
as the entire field forfeits.

33:34.361 --> 33:37.528
Okay, that was incredible.
How did he do that?

33:37.530 --> 33:39.930
Max? I was the one
holding the leash.

33:39.932 --> 33:43.735
- Yeah, but...
- Max, that was very unsportsmanlike.

33:43.737 --> 33:45.069
Tell that to Ling Li.

33:45.071 --> 33:47.838
Besides, it was a good thing
I did out there today.

33:47.840 --> 33:51.042
Warms my heart to see
that family reunited.

33:51.044 --> 33:54.446
Huh. You're different than
other show dogs, aren't you?

33:54.448 --> 33:57.551
I'm a mutt of many mysteries.

34:11.831 --> 34:14.431
- Right-hand drive?
- Straight from London, baby.

34:14.434 --> 34:16.833
This is so exciting.
My first stakeout.

34:16.835 --> 34:18.603
This don't smell right.

34:18.605 --> 34:20.871
What kind of party is
in an abandoned warehouse, huh?

34:20.873 --> 34:23.742
A very exclusive one,
of course.

34:30.784 --> 34:33.117
<i>♪ This is your heart ♪</i>

34:33.119 --> 34:35.052
<i>♪ It's alive ♪</i>

34:35.054 --> 34:36.820
Whoa.
Definitely a party.

34:36.822 --> 34:37.987
Oh, I love it.

34:37.989 --> 34:39.989
The glamour, the fashion.

34:39.992 --> 34:42.159
The toilet water.

34:42.161 --> 34:43.994
All right,
here's the plan.

34:43.996 --> 34:45.996
I'm gonna see who tries to
sell me that panda.

34:50.436 --> 34:52.036
- Try not to blow my cover.
- Oh, yeah?

34:52.038 --> 34:55.572
Well, while you're off chasing your
tail, I'll be cracking this case.

34:55.574 --> 34:56.940
Why am I talking to dogs?

34:59.679 --> 35:02.880
Ooh-ho-ho. I've got
you this time.

35:02.882 --> 35:05.083
What is all this talk
about the panda?

35:05.085 --> 35:07.184
That is on
a need-to-know basis.

35:07.186 --> 35:08.920
Ooh! Silly me.

35:08.922 --> 35:12.090
I forgot I was stuck with a
hard-bitten cop who trusts no one.

35:12.092 --> 35:14.525
Oh, there you are.

35:14.527 --> 35:16.661
Thought this was VIP. What,
do you know the bouncer?

35:16.663 --> 35:18.429
Wellington Upstill.

35:18.431 --> 35:20.965
Uh, I wanted to introduce
you to a client of mine.

35:20.967 --> 35:23.668
This is Señor Gabriel
and his dog Karma.

35:23.670 --> 35:25.503
What's up, boy-boy?

35:25.505 --> 35:26.938
Well, that's some dog.

35:26.940 --> 35:28.572
He's my best friend.

35:28.574 --> 35:30.541
The only one who loves me
unconditionally.

35:30.543 --> 35:33.644
Well, that's great that
you two have that connection.

35:39.820 --> 35:41.756
I'm sorry, Gabe. Where did
you say you were from?

35:43.190 --> 35:44.555
Here and there.

35:49.862 --> 35:51.662
Dang, that
photographer's slippery.

35:51.664 --> 35:53.465
- Where did he go?
- Whoo-hoo! Max!

35:53.467 --> 35:56.166
Whoo! Buddy, you were
incredible today.

35:57.737 --> 36:00.037
How did you get to be so alpha?

36:00.039 --> 36:02.106
Um, by not caring.

36:02.108 --> 36:04.708
- Not caring? Seriously?
- Hmm?

36:04.710 --> 36:07.177
Now, what do we have here?

36:07.179 --> 36:11.115
Bodyguard.
Bodyguard by the door.

36:11.117 --> 36:13.150
I gotta get me
in that room.

36:13.152 --> 36:15.119
I need some kind of
distraction.

36:15.121 --> 36:17.222
Maxwell, are you
listening to me?

36:17.224 --> 36:20.691
- Hey, how come there's no dogs in the pool?
- The night before a competition?

36:20.693 --> 36:22.193
Please.
The mats.

36:22.195 --> 36:24.095
The tangles.
The pH balance.

36:24.097 --> 36:25.829
That's all I needed to hear.

36:25.831 --> 36:28.833
Maxwell, what are you doing?

36:28.835 --> 36:31.639
I'm getting this party started!

36:33.106 --> 36:35.773
Ahhh!
That feels good.

36:35.775 --> 36:37.941
- Huh?
- Outrageous.

36:37.943 --> 36:39.978
- Can he do that?
- Gee, I-I don't know.

36:39.980 --> 36:42.746
- Oh, boy.
- Daisy, isn't that your boy in the swimming pool?

36:42.748 --> 36:45.650
- No. You know I don't go for bad boys.
- Mm-hmm.

36:45.652 --> 36:46.851
Are you crazy?

36:46.853 --> 36:49.052
Do you want us all to be
replaced by CGI?

36:49.054 --> 36:50.588
- Oh!
- Oh, man.

36:50.590 --> 36:53.124
Well, this event's becoming
dreadfully common.

36:53.126 --> 36:54.925
Cowabunga!

36:54.927 --> 36:56.994
- Wanna do it?
- Oh, yeah, sure. You betcha.

36:56.996 --> 37:00.632
- Come on, everybody.
- This is not Canini. This is chaos.

37:00.634 --> 37:02.633
It's a pool party!

37:02.635 --> 37:05.003
- Yeah!
- What are you waiting for, Sprinkles?

37:05.005 --> 37:06.073
Oh, pugs don't float.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.840
Whoo!

37:09.842 --> 37:11.075
Oh! Oh, watch out.

37:11.077 --> 37:12.309
Oh, gosh.

37:12.311 --> 37:13.878
Cannonball!

37:13.880 --> 37:15.847
Hurry, hurry!

37:15.849 --> 37:20.653
Party! Party!
Party! Party! Party!

37:22.021 --> 37:26.826
Mm-hmm! That is
some fine canine.

37:28.894 --> 37:31.729
- Get the dog out of the pool!
- Good. Now to get in that room.

37:31.731 --> 37:35.900
Impressive, but maybe you should save your
big splash for the final competition.

37:35.902 --> 37:38.202
Huh. Got any more insider
tips you could share?

37:38.204 --> 37:40.737
Maybe.
If the price is right.

37:40.739 --> 37:42.807
Let me see
what I can do.

37:42.809 --> 37:46.945
Tell you what, meet me outside the
hotel after Mattie goes to sleep.

37:46.947 --> 37:49.613
Now, if you'll excuse me, I got
some business to take care of.

37:51.150 --> 37:53.717
Congratulations, gentlemen.

37:53.719 --> 37:56.688
You will soon be in possession
of this year's Best in Show.

37:56.690 --> 37:57.722
Best in Show?

37:57.724 --> 37:58.692
Whoa.

37:59.893 --> 38:01.561
Uh-oh.

38:02.829 --> 38:04.965
Think of something, Max.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.742
Inbreeding.

38:17.744 --> 38:19.579
There's that ringtone.

38:22.181 --> 38:24.983
Oh, I got you now.

38:24.985 --> 38:27.351
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

38:27.353 --> 38:29.320
The deal's closed.
Three million.

38:29.322 --> 38:32.090
You're gonna love it. It's one of the
most beautiful creatures I've ever seen.

38:32.092 --> 38:35.193
- Let's see.
- We got it. I'll be there.

38:35.195 --> 38:37.961
- Yeah, got the money.
- We have spoken at length.

38:37.963 --> 38:39.998
Which one of you has my panda?

38:40.000 --> 38:42.066
Bear?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:42.068 --> 38:45.235
Don't worry.

38:45.237 --> 38:48.405
I'll have the panda all prettied up
by the time them buyers get here.

38:48.407 --> 38:50.041
What's that?

38:50.043 --> 38:51.708
Ten minutes, is it?

38:51.710 --> 38:53.978
We'll be ready.
No problem.

38:53.980 --> 38:56.313
There you are.
I quit.

38:56.315 --> 38:58.682
I am finished being
your teacher, Maxwell.

38:58.684 --> 39:00.684
You are cynical,
overbearing.

39:00.686 --> 39:03.655
You have no friends.
You cannot work with partners.

39:03.657 --> 39:06.090
- You trust no one. You...
- You done?

39:06.092 --> 39:07.691
Tell me what is going on!

39:07.693 --> 39:09.059
All right, all right.

39:09.061 --> 39:10.827
I'm working a kidnapping case.

39:10.829 --> 39:12.896
A baby panda was stolen from her mother,

39:12.898 --> 39:15.400
and the people who did it
are somewhere at this party.

39:15.402 --> 39:17.200
Best in Show, eh?

39:17.202 --> 39:19.903
Really?
Okay, an extra cage?

39:19.905 --> 39:21.905
Right.
Talk later.

39:21.907 --> 39:22.875
Oi, Fluffy.

39:26.311 --> 39:28.278
No.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.918
Ling Li, I'm talking to you.
Wait there, you little moppet.

39:32.117 --> 39:33.284
Ling Li?

39:33.286 --> 39:35.086
No.
No, Fluffy.

39:35.088 --> 39:36.387
- No, Fluffy. No, no.
- Wee!

39:36.389 --> 39:37.789
Fluffy.

39:37.791 --> 39:39.389
Hi.

39:39.391 --> 39:40.891
I shall help you, Maxwell.

39:40.893 --> 39:42.827
Uh, okay. Great.

39:42.829 --> 39:45.095
And I shall
help you too.

39:45.097 --> 39:47.898
Maybe it's not the worst idea
to get some help.

39:47.900 --> 39:48.999
- Yes.
- Okay, then.

39:49.001 --> 39:51.168
- I'm deputizing both of you.
- Really?

39:51.170 --> 39:53.704
So freaking alpha!

39:53.706 --> 39:57.742
Spread out. You see anything suspicious,
report immediately to your CO.

39:57.744 --> 39:59.476
- Yes, sir.
- I accept.

39:59.478 --> 40:01.144
But I get to be the bad cop.

40:01.146 --> 40:02.048
Fluffy!

40:05.851 --> 40:07.985
Fluffy. Fluffy.

40:07.987 --> 40:09.189
Fluffy?

40:10.757 --> 40:12.757
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

40:12.759 --> 40:14.992
Get out of my way.
Ling Li, where you gone?

40:14.994 --> 40:16.293
Where are you?
Ling Li.

40:16.295 --> 40:17.994
Okay, one second.

40:17.996 --> 40:20.398
I need you to guarantee
we can deliver Best in Show.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.733
Whose life are you
ruining now, Chauncey?

40:22.735 --> 40:25.001
- Can we get a selfie with you?
- Oh, well, if you insist.

40:25.003 --> 40:26.237
Ahh!

40:26.239 --> 40:27.639
Cute.

40:27.641 --> 40:31.441
<i>Mon Dieu.</i> I look like the crazed ferret.
The world can never see.

40:31.443 --> 40:33.276
- Get back here!
- Ling Li.

40:33.278 --> 40:35.382
I'm on your tail,
suspicious dude.

40:36.782 --> 40:38.282
- Oh!
- Sorry, love. Excuse me.

40:40.018 --> 40:42.153
Whoo! Wow!

40:42.155 --> 40:44.088
Whoa! I didn't know dogs
could climb trees.

40:44.090 --> 40:45.322
Let me just...

40:45.324 --> 40:48.391
Is this cupcake frosting? It is!

40:51.364 --> 40:53.000
Wee!

40:58.905 --> 41:01.773
You gonna lead me
straight to that panda, right?

41:01.775 --> 41:03.039
Wait!
I'm not done.

41:03.041 --> 41:04.474
Oh, hey, guys.

41:04.476 --> 41:06.244
You investigating
frosting too?

41:06.246 --> 41:08.845
You got some behind your ear. I
can get that for you if you like.

41:08.847 --> 41:10.884
It'd be my pleasure.

41:21.894 --> 41:24.163
I got you now.

41:31.271 --> 41:33.371
Ow! Hey!

41:33.373 --> 41:35.438
Get off me.
What are you doing?

41:35.440 --> 41:39.177
Whoa!
Hi there. Sorry.

41:39.179 --> 41:41.077
I knew I should have left
you tied up outside.

41:41.079 --> 41:42.815
Yeah, well, I should have
tied you up in New York.

41:46.952 --> 41:49.554
I am so glad you could make it, Mr.
Upstill.

41:49.556 --> 41:51.956
Yeah, sorry.
We were just, you know...

41:51.958 --> 41:53.356
We were...
And then she was...

41:53.358 --> 41:56.827
But, anyway,
thank you for, you know...

41:56.829 --> 42:00.530
I'm just really looking forward to
getting a private moment that we...

42:00.532 --> 42:02.300
As am I.

42:02.302 --> 42:05.135
Yes, 'cause we can discuss
that matter that we wanted to...

42:05.137 --> 42:06.304
Yes, indeed.

42:06.306 --> 42:08.940
The rare animals.

42:08.942 --> 42:12.275
You know, I have researched
all of the competitors,

42:12.277 --> 42:16.847
and I could not help but notice the
supremely striking specimen you possess.

42:16.849 --> 42:18.182
Max?

42:18.184 --> 42:23.954
I am giving you the opportunity
to breed your dog

42:23.956 --> 42:27.090
with my Old English
Whipi-Huahua-Hound.

42:27.092 --> 42:28.458
Your what, now?

42:28.460 --> 42:30.494
Persephone, get out! Come.

42:30.496 --> 42:32.162
Hey.

42:32.164 --> 42:34.498
- The only one in the world.
- Uh-huh.

42:34.500 --> 42:37.635
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Can I get an amen up in here?

42:37.637 --> 42:39.237
Oh, boy.

42:39.239 --> 42:41.238
- Whoa.
- Yeah, you cute.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.307
But I have to work
with you first, honey.

42:43.309 --> 42:45.508
You definitely gonna
have to lose that tail.

42:45.510 --> 42:48.880
- What? Okay.
- And that breath.

42:48.882 --> 42:50.947
You're a toilet drinker,
am I right?

42:50.949 --> 42:54.017
Oh, all the time. I mean, I'm
completely gross, trust me.

42:54.019 --> 42:55.920
Wait. Hold up.
Is that a bald spot?

42:55.922 --> 42:58.322
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- You need some Rogaine, honey.

42:58.324 --> 42:59.893
There you are.

43:01.193 --> 43:03.026
Come on, Poopsie.

43:03.028 --> 43:05.329
Oh, Mama's tired.

43:05.331 --> 43:08.999
Let's go home
and have some choco-drops, okay?

43:12.070 --> 43:15.171
Persephones do not date baldies,
no fools, no long...

43:15.173 --> 43:18.175
Girl, is it hot in here
or is it you?

43:18.177 --> 43:20.978
Oh! I'm not touching that.
Check, please.

43:20.980 --> 43:23.213
Everything's better
with Sprinkles.

43:23.215 --> 43:26.249
Due to the fact that you are
too pugly, good-bye.

43:26.251 --> 43:29.452
Look, they are bonding already.

43:29.454 --> 43:32.356
Can you imagine how glorious
their puppies will be?

43:32.358 --> 43:33.657
P-P-Puppies?

43:33.659 --> 43:35.992
I...

43:39.364 --> 43:41.699
No.
No, I don't think so.

43:41.701 --> 43:44.168
- What's that?
- My dog doesn't wanna do it.

43:44.170 --> 43:47.237
What do you care
what your dog wants?

43:47.239 --> 43:48.474
Well...

43:50.175 --> 43:53.344
I think everyone deserves
to choose love for themselves,

43:53.346 --> 43:56.079
even if they are a dog.

43:56.081 --> 43:58.449
- Huh. What do you know.
- Will you excuse me?

43:58.451 --> 44:00.184
Persephone, come.

44:00.186 --> 44:03.454
Yes, honey.
Sashay away.

44:03.456 --> 44:06.324
We never got a chance to...
talk about the...

44:06.326 --> 44:08.059
Crisis averted.

44:08.061 --> 44:09.459
For you and me both.

44:09.461 --> 44:11.394
- So you found the panda?
- No.

44:11.396 --> 44:13.197
I destroyed a terrible
photo of myself.

44:13.199 --> 44:15.700
Did you learn anything?

44:15.702 --> 44:17.434
Well, I don't know
if they're connected,

44:17.436 --> 44:19.970
but something's going down
involving the Best in Show winner.

44:21.340 --> 44:23.240
I'm gonna see if I can gain
some more insight tonight.

44:23.242 --> 44:24.675
All right, come on.

44:24.677 --> 44:27.079
Hopefully, for Ling Li's sake,
tomorrow's a better day.

44:29.181 --> 44:31.349
Whoa!

44:31.351 --> 44:33.987
Hey! Hey!

44:35.054 --> 44:36.354
Come back with my Poopsie!

44:38.757 --> 44:41.325
Oh, Poopsie,
there you are.

44:41.327 --> 44:42.229
Come on, Poopsie.

44:45.063 --> 44:48.199
Terribly sorry I'm late,
ladies and gentlemen.

44:48.201 --> 44:50.333
The bidding starts
at a mere ten million

44:50.335 --> 44:52.470
for this exquisite,

44:52.472 --> 44:56.639
cherished
and most beautiful creature.

44:56.641 --> 44:58.441
Can I get ten million?

44:58.443 --> 45:00.443
Ten million from the man
in the suit.

45:26.105 --> 45:27.505
You look amazing.

45:27.507 --> 45:29.206
Thank you.

45:29.208 --> 45:32.510
So, the mutt of many mysteries
wants some insider show tips.

45:32.512 --> 45:34.311
Yes, I do.

45:34.313 --> 45:36.347
You gotta give me
something first.

45:36.349 --> 45:37.581
L-Like what?

45:37.583 --> 45:41.052
Show me what it's like
on the outside.

45:41.054 --> 45:42.586
You've never been
leash-less, have you?

45:42.588 --> 45:45.055
Don't make fun of me.

45:45.057 --> 45:47.791
So, what do you do when you
aren't tied to someone?

45:47.793 --> 45:49.159
Ha! Come on.

45:50.695 --> 45:52.396
- On three. Ready?
- Oh, gosh.

45:52.398 --> 45:53.430
- One...
- Okay.

45:53.432 --> 45:55.432
- Two...
- Oh, I'm going to faint.

45:55.434 --> 45:58.101
Three! Whoo-hoo!

45:58.103 --> 46:00.438
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

46:00.440 --> 46:03.106
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

46:03.108 --> 46:05.508
Yeah!

46:05.510 --> 46:06.811
<i>♪ Waiting for the moment
We can touch ♪</i>

46:06.813 --> 46:08.778
This is amazing, Max.

46:08.780 --> 46:12.115
- What?
- I said this is amazing.

46:12.117 --> 46:14.221
Whoo! Vegas!

46:18.657 --> 46:21.825
- Sean! Sean, wait!
- Ta-da!

46:21.827 --> 46:24.762
- Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Sorry!

46:24.764 --> 46:27.067
Whoa!

46:28.867 --> 46:30.467
Another one. Two.

46:30.469 --> 46:33.072
Another one. Another one.

46:34.474 --> 46:36.840
One, two. In the hat.

46:36.842 --> 46:38.377
There you go.

46:39.545 --> 46:41.244
Oh. This is some dinner.

46:41.246 --> 46:43.581
And these are just
the appetizers.

46:43.583 --> 46:45.619
For the main course I have
something really special.

46:46.818 --> 46:49.588
<i>♪ I'm staying up for love ♪</i>

46:52.824 --> 46:55.291
This is so beautiful.

46:55.293 --> 46:58.662
All right.
Dinner is served.

46:58.664 --> 47:01.565
Oh, my gosh. Garbage.

47:01.567 --> 47:04.300
- My favorite.
- Garbage? No.

47:04.302 --> 47:08.171
This is the finest New York style
hot dog this city has to offer.

47:08.173 --> 47:11.445
Oh, really?
In that case, I can't wait.

47:12.911 --> 47:14.612
- Ooh.
- Oh, whoops.

47:15.914 --> 47:17.780
This is so romantic.

47:17.782 --> 47:19.849
He's a-lady-
and-the-tramping her.

47:19.851 --> 47:21.818
What?
You gotta be kidding me.

47:21.820 --> 47:23.787
You guys flew
all the way out here?

47:23.789 --> 47:25.389
Of course. Hello!

47:25.391 --> 47:26.824
We follow all your cases.

47:26.826 --> 47:28.559
And your kisses.

47:28.561 --> 47:30.528
- Knock it off.
- Max, who are these guys?

47:30.530 --> 47:33.264
Remember that time you went undercover
as an emotional support dog?

47:33.266 --> 47:35.432
So sensitive. So vulnerable.

47:35.434 --> 47:36.566
So dreamy.

47:36.568 --> 47:38.601
- He cried.
- That was acting.

47:38.603 --> 47:41.804
Just an undercover cop
doing his job.

47:41.806 --> 47:43.474
- Get out of here. Scram.
- Wait.

47:43.476 --> 47:45.342
So you're, what, a cop?

47:47.579 --> 47:49.345
Y-Yes.

47:49.347 --> 47:51.648
Yes, I am.
I'm working undercover.

47:51.650 --> 47:53.583
As a show dog?

47:53.585 --> 47:55.586
Yeah.
Can you believe it?

47:55.588 --> 47:57.387
Prancing around
in stupid little circles,

47:57.389 --> 47:59.822
looking pretty,
pretending I'm one...

47:59.824 --> 48:01.391
- One of us?
- I know, right?

48:01.393 --> 48:04.228
Can you imagine me acting
all fake and phony?

48:04.230 --> 48:06.697
Wait. That's what you think
being a show dog is?

48:06.699 --> 48:09.934
Well, yeah. I mean, dogs like me
are out there in the streets,

48:09.936 --> 48:12.635
in the real world, doing
the real work, you know?

48:12.637 --> 48:15.405
Yeah, I do know.

48:15.407 --> 48:18.242
I know you think this thing that
I've devoted my entire life to

48:18.244 --> 48:20.844
is fake and stupid
and shallow.

48:20.846 --> 48:23.880
And you ask me out here why?
'Cause you like me?

48:23.882 --> 48:25.916
Well, yeah, Daisy,
but I also...

48:25.918 --> 48:29.586
But you don't respect me
or who I am or what I do.

48:29.588 --> 48:31.588
Come on, Daisy,
it's not like that.

48:31.590 --> 48:34.458
- Good luck on your case, Max.
- What? I...

48:34.460 --> 48:37.494
Daisy, what about
the inside infor... Ah.

48:37.496 --> 48:38.929
Awkward.

48:38.931 --> 48:41.599
You, uh, need
a wingman, Max?

48:41.601 --> 48:43.633
Oh, be strong, Max.

48:43.635 --> 48:46.472
I won't leave you, ever.

48:55.847 --> 48:58.249
We've got no suspects,

48:58.251 --> 49:00.684
and if we get eliminated, we're
gonna lose all our access.

49:00.686 --> 49:02.885
So no pressure then, huh?

49:02.887 --> 49:05.021
Maybe that perp in New York
gave us bad information.

49:05.023 --> 49:07.657
Maybe the panda was never even here.

49:07.659 --> 49:08.961
Hmm.

49:11.329 --> 49:13.264
Your eyebrows
always been this uneven?

49:13.266 --> 49:16.666
Competitors to the main stage
in five minutes, please.

49:16.668 --> 49:18.034
- Five minutes.
- Oh, this is not good.

49:18.036 --> 49:21.271
- Not good at all.
- Calm down.

49:21.273 --> 49:24.374
You are about to go into
your biggest challenge yet,

49:24.376 --> 49:25.842
and you have not
prepared at all.

49:25.844 --> 49:27.478
You will be humiliated.

49:27.480 --> 49:30.282
Making me nervous isn't
gonna make it any better.

49:32.018 --> 49:35.719
- There we go.
- You missed a spot, Frank.

49:35.721 --> 49:38.557
You know what?
I think I missed a spot.

49:40.693 --> 49:44.028
- Beautiful.
- Daisy wins the herding group agility round!

49:44.030 --> 49:46.429
Hey, Mr. Upstill.

49:46.431 --> 49:48.999
Please stand by while we
reset the stage for the working...

49:49.001 --> 49:50.900
"Agility round."

49:50.902 --> 49:53.570
Ho ho. I got this.

49:53.572 --> 49:55.338
Ladies and gentlemen,

49:55.340 --> 49:58.409
welcome to the Canini
Invitational disc competition.

49:58.411 --> 50:00.443
- Go, Karma!
- Each dog must catch

50:00.445 --> 50:02.813
and return discs
to the judges.

50:02.815 --> 50:06.784
The first dog to return three
discs wins the competition.

50:06.786 --> 50:08.954
Max, come on!

50:13.759 --> 50:15.391
What?

50:15.393 --> 50:17.327
- Whoa.
- Nice vertical.

50:17.329 --> 50:19.762
Dog number two, the
rottweiler, has returned all the discs.

50:19.764 --> 50:21.764
He cannot do that.
Can he do that?

50:21.766 --> 50:23.467
I can't believe my eyes.

50:23.469 --> 50:25.034
- Let's see what the judges think.
- Number one.

50:25.036 --> 50:26.603
That's right.

50:26.605 --> 50:28.472
- The rottweiler wins the round.
- Yes!

50:28.474 --> 50:30.740
It's incredible.

50:30.742 --> 50:32.742
- You blind or what?
- Sorry. I'm so sorry.

50:32.744 --> 50:34.378
Well... Well-played.
Thank you.

50:34.380 --> 50:36.646
Round two.
The high jump competition.

50:41.519 --> 50:43.720
What's this?

50:43.722 --> 50:46.789
The rottweiler wants the bars
set at a new record height.

50:46.791 --> 50:48.060
Uh-huh.

50:52.030 --> 50:54.365
Aha!

50:54.367 --> 50:58.071
I can't believe it.
The rottweiler does it again.

50:59.371 --> 51:01.572
We are witnessing
history, folks.

51:01.574 --> 51:02.608
He's a good jumper.

51:04.110 --> 51:06.543
- Round three.
- Go, Karma. Come on, come on.

51:06.545 --> 51:10.847
- You can't push the river. It flows on its own.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

51:10.849 --> 51:14.851
And the komondor has a very
good run, putting him in first place.

51:14.853 --> 51:17.022
Let's see
what the rottweiler can do.

51:19.692 --> 51:23.927
And the rottweiler has
an amazing run of 17 seconds.

51:23.929 --> 51:27.530
Ladies and gentlemen,
a new Canini record.

51:27.532 --> 51:29.800
The final round.

51:29.802 --> 51:33.137
An assault course combining
speed, agility, and intelligence.

51:33.139 --> 51:37.410
The first dog to get their colored bag
back to the judges wins maximum points.

51:43.014 --> 51:45.115
Hey!

51:45.117 --> 51:47.450
You like the view?
Fresh bikini wax.

51:47.452 --> 51:50.854
The rottweiler goes
up to another competitor's tube.

51:50.856 --> 51:52.155
Over and out.

51:52.157 --> 51:53.726
I'm not even sure
if that's legal.

51:55.527 --> 51:57.894
- Step off my tower.
- Yes. Sorry.

51:57.896 --> 52:00.164
And the boxer
has taken the lead.

52:00.166 --> 52:02.499
Dang, how did
he get ahead of me?

52:02.501 --> 52:03.703
Here goes nothing.

52:04.869 --> 52:06.804
And the rottweiler,

52:06.806 --> 52:11.008
he's jumping and he's...

52:11.010 --> 52:15.077
- What just happened?
- Max, with the buzzer beater from half court.

52:15.079 --> 52:16.947
This is unprecedented,
ladies and gentlemen.

52:16.949 --> 52:20.617
And the judges are checking
the rule books.

52:20.619 --> 52:22.655
Number one.

52:23.822 --> 52:26.023
An unknown rottweiler

52:26.025 --> 52:29.226
is rewriting what it means to be
a show dog before our very eyes.

52:29.228 --> 52:30.594
Good job, buddy!

52:30.596 --> 52:33.666
Game, set, Max.

52:36.001 --> 52:38.505
- Congratulations, Mr. Upstill.
- Thank you.

52:42.507 --> 52:44.608
Whew! We did it, buddy.
You did a great job.

52:44.610 --> 52:46.677
All right, guys.
I'm proud of you.

52:46.679 --> 52:49.213
- Sorry, Karma. Can't win 'em all.
- No worries.

52:49.215 --> 52:52.048
My happiness is
not dependent on outcomes.

52:52.050 --> 52:54.617
Plus, I have four rings,
three finals MVP's,

52:54.619 --> 52:56.119
15 All-Star appearances,

52:56.121 --> 52:58.588
and, yes,
I'm a Hall of Famer.

52:58.590 --> 53:00.590
- Namaste.
- Okay.

53:00.592 --> 53:02.226
Mr. Upstill,
congratulations.

53:02.228 --> 53:05.963
- That is one incredible dog.
- He is. Thank you.

53:05.965 --> 53:08.699
- Reset the stage for the toy group, please.
- Bravo.

53:08.701 --> 53:12.001
- What's wrong?
- I can't help but to feel pity for these champions.

53:12.003 --> 53:13.503
Because they lost?

53:13.505 --> 53:16.539
Because they were denied
their glory

53:16.541 --> 53:19.642
by your unorthodox
showboating.

53:19.644 --> 53:21.512
Oh, come on.
It's just a dog show.

53:21.514 --> 53:23.112
<i>Non,</i> this is more.

53:23.114 --> 53:26.682
This is the one place you
can be proud to be yourself,

53:26.684 --> 53:29.586
no matter if you
are big or fat,

53:29.588 --> 53:31.088
furry or bald,

53:31.090 --> 53:35.525
or a tiny papillon
from a pig farm in Belgium.

53:35.527 --> 53:38.729
This is
the Canini Invitational.

53:38.731 --> 53:42.099
It is not just
a dog show, <i>monsieur.</i>

53:42.101 --> 53:44.534
What? What did I say?

53:44.536 --> 53:47.637
Whoa! That not caring thing
is so alpha.

53:47.639 --> 53:49.873
Oh, man, let me try it. Let me try.

53:49.875 --> 53:51.575
"Hey, I'm Max.

53:51.577 --> 53:53.744
You know, dog shows
are so stupid.

53:53.746 --> 53:56.947
I'll probably forget all your
names after this weekend,

53:56.949 --> 53:58.315
except Sprinkles.

53:58.317 --> 54:00.253
I wish he was
my best friend."

54:03.021 --> 54:06.659
I wish
the same thing too, Max.

54:08.293 --> 54:10.994
Hey, congratulations. It's good.
Winning bought you some time.

54:10.996 --> 54:13.896
Which is a good thing. When
it comes to kidnappings,

54:13.898 --> 54:17.202
- one wrong move could...
- ...jeopardize the victim's safety.

54:18.704 --> 54:20.704
You really know
your stuff.

54:20.706 --> 54:22.075
Unfortunately.

54:24.809 --> 54:28.213
I never did ask you how you
got involved with the FBI.

54:29.248 --> 54:32.349
A few years ago, um,

54:32.351 --> 54:36.556
a border collie
that I was handling was stolen.

54:39.023 --> 54:40.757
Really?

54:40.759 --> 54:43.193
Yeah. Uh, his name
was Jasper.

54:43.195 --> 54:46.128
He was, like, the sweetest
thing you ever saw.

54:46.130 --> 54:48.030
Jasper's a cute name.

54:48.032 --> 54:50.666
He would run in these little
circles around all the kids,

54:50.668 --> 54:53.036
and I don't know if it's 'cause
he thought they were sheep

54:53.038 --> 54:55.240
or maybe he just thought
they were vulnerable, but...

54:57.009 --> 54:59.711
I think that he just wanted
to protect everybody.

55:01.280 --> 55:03.646
But I couldn't
protect him, you know.

55:03.648 --> 55:06.719
I'm... so sorry.

55:12.925 --> 55:14.958
Jasper was worth
a lot of money, right?

55:14.960 --> 55:17.360
He's a world champion,
so he's worth millions.

55:17.362 --> 55:19.762
You see, I think
this is all connected.

55:19.764 --> 55:22.868
See, I think these people, they didn't
just come here to sell a panda.

55:24.737 --> 55:26.637
They came here
to steal a dog.

55:26.639 --> 55:29.139
- Okay, but which one?
- I don't know. Which one's the most valuable?

55:29.141 --> 55:31.307
- Whoever wins Best in Show.
- Oh, yeah.

55:31.309 --> 55:32.909
Now we are cooking
with gas, people.

55:35.079 --> 55:37.113
<i>Hola, hola.</i>

55:37.115 --> 55:39.782
Ah, Gabriel.

55:39.784 --> 55:41.351
I'm so sorry
about Karma.

55:41.353 --> 55:43.789
Ah. It's what
the universe wanted, I suppose.

55:45.356 --> 55:47.724
- Congratulations, Mr. Upstill.
- Thank you.

55:47.726 --> 55:49.959
Nothing could change
how I feel about this guy.

55:49.961 --> 55:53.229
I don't dwell on the past. The
present is its own present.

55:53.231 --> 55:55.365
I just came
to thank you. Really.

55:55.367 --> 55:57.034
We'll be leaving tomorrow,

55:57.036 --> 55:59.735
but we wanna reserve your
services again for next year.

55:59.737 --> 56:02.204
Of course.
It'd be my pleasure.

56:02.206 --> 56:04.840
- Thank you, as always, Mattie.
- Wet-Naps, lavender scented.

56:04.842 --> 56:06.712
- Have a good trip.
- My friend.

56:08.847 --> 56:10.249
Let's go.

56:11.349 --> 56:13.717
- Deputies, on my six.
- Yes, sir.

56:13.719 --> 56:14.987
Ooh. Code. I like it.

56:21.260 --> 56:24.226
Because I know exactly
what I'm doing. Yeah.

56:24.228 --> 56:26.832
They will have to triple that
for a Best in Show.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.800
Why are we doing this?

56:30.802 --> 56:33.436
Gabriel is a pillar
of the community.

56:33.438 --> 56:36.472
We're doing this
because it's fun. Ha ha!

56:36.474 --> 56:38.407
Yeah, right.
I'm being crazy.

56:38.409 --> 56:41.744
Half the world
uses Wet-Naps, right?

56:41.746 --> 56:44.847
Hey, I recognize that
guy from the warehouse party.

56:44.849 --> 56:46.717
He smelled funny then too.

56:46.719 --> 56:48.751
What is that peculiar scent?

56:48.753 --> 56:52.054
That scent is bear.
Panda bear.

56:52.056 --> 56:54.090
Gabriel is the smuggler.

56:54.092 --> 56:55.391
- Whoa.
- Go get Frank.

56:55.393 --> 56:56.927
Philippe and I'll
corner him, okay?

56:56.929 --> 56:58.161
Yes, sir.

56:58.163 --> 57:00.429
On the count of three,
we jump out and growl.

57:00.431 --> 57:03.400
The plastic surgery makes
only the smiling possible.

57:03.402 --> 57:05.168
Oh, grow some balls.
I'll do it alone.

57:05.170 --> 57:06.903
I'm gonna have
the Best in Show.

57:06.905 --> 57:09.139
Hey, hey, hey.

57:09.141 --> 57:12.075
You are under arrest.

57:12.077 --> 57:14.478
Is this violence and anger
really what's in your heart?

57:14.480 --> 57:15.912
Step aside.

57:15.914 --> 57:18.115
Let us meditate
on the situation.

57:18.117 --> 57:21.184
Yama, yama, yama, yama.
I don't see you guys meditating.

57:21.186 --> 57:24.186
I'm not kidding, Doggy Lama.
Step aside.

57:24.188 --> 57:28.758
Future me forgives
past you for present us.

57:28.760 --> 57:30.396
What?

57:34.500 --> 57:36.398
Frank.

57:36.400 --> 57:39.235
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

57:39.237 --> 57:42.238
It's Gabriel. He's the smuggler.
He has the panda.

57:42.240 --> 57:44.173
- Max, what's wrong with you?
- The panda.

57:44.175 --> 57:46.242
The cute little fuzzy thing
about this size.

57:46.244 --> 57:48.845
- What? What? What?
- Ah, come on, Frank. Don't you get it?

57:48.847 --> 57:50.347
- Hey!
- Easy, boy.

57:50.349 --> 57:52.849
- What's going on?
- This dog attacked a man

57:52.851 --> 57:55.351
and is being remanded to
city custody for 24 hours.

57:55.353 --> 57:57.787
- Max doesn't attack people.
- I'm sorry, sir.

57:57.789 --> 58:00.023
He attacked
a Mr. Gabriel Esteban.

58:00.025 --> 58:01.458
Is Gabriel all right?

58:01.460 --> 58:03.459
He's fine, but he's alerted us
to this public safety threat.

58:03.461 --> 58:05.528
- This is bs.
- Max.

58:05.530 --> 58:07.998
Gabriel's got the panda and
he's trying to get rid of me.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.534
- Hey, take it easy on him.
- Max! Max!

58:10.536 --> 58:12.034
- No, leave him!
- Max.

58:12.036 --> 58:15.171
No! I'm not the one
you should be arresting.

58:15.173 --> 58:17.874
- Max!
- Why can't people understand what dogs say?

58:17.876 --> 58:19.909
- No! No!
- Philippe, tell them.

58:19.911 --> 58:21.411
- He is innocent!
- Frank!

58:21.413 --> 58:23.782
Max! Max!

58:26.117 --> 58:28.450
- Why would Max go after Gabriel?
- I don't know.

58:28.452 --> 58:31.121
- What do you know about him?
- He's been a client for years.

58:31.123 --> 58:33.490
I've been to events
in three continents with him.

58:33.492 --> 58:38.260
He must have done something. I
mean, Max is a trained police dog.

58:38.262 --> 58:40.329
Look, you said it
yourself, right?

58:40.331 --> 58:42.201
He's got
anger issues sometimes.

58:44.068 --> 58:46.972
Something here
just doesn't add up.

59:17.101 --> 59:18.403
Fool me once, shame on you.

59:19.471 --> 59:22.407
You fool me twice,
shame on me.

59:38.623 --> 59:39.923
Hey.

59:39.925 --> 59:42.157
Hey there, bud.

59:42.159 --> 59:43.525
You're a good
little dude, huh?

59:43.527 --> 59:44.994
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

59:44.996 --> 59:47.197
Down, boy.

59:47.199 --> 59:49.432
Oh. My apologies.

59:49.434 --> 59:53.168
He just has so much energy from being
pent up all day clearing customs.

59:53.170 --> 59:56.373
Such a dreadful amount of paperwork
to bring a dog into the country.

59:56.375 --> 59:57.941
I know. Me too.

59:57.943 --> 59:59.111
Customs.

01:00:00.344 --> 01:00:01.443
Right.

01:00:01.445 --> 01:00:03.914
Sloth. Python.

01:00:03.916 --> 01:00:06.152
Bengal tiger.
Dozens more.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.921
Gabriel was at all
the animal kidnappings,

01:00:11.923 --> 01:00:15.191
each one coinciding
with an international dog show.

01:00:15.193 --> 01:00:18.295
Max was right.
He is a very bad man.

01:00:18.297 --> 01:00:22.432
You would know this already if you
bothered to learn our language.

01:00:22.434 --> 01:00:24.971
Lazy American.

01:00:26.304 --> 01:00:27.973
Max must have known.

01:00:35.614 --> 01:00:38.548
Come on.
We've got a panda to save.

01:00:43.255 --> 01:00:44.521
I don't understand.

01:00:44.523 --> 01:00:47.456
Why doesn't he just
arrest Gabriel?

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:50.427
Because that would alert the
other members of his syndicate.

01:00:50.429 --> 01:00:52.262
We need to have Gabriel
lead us to her.

01:00:52.264 --> 01:00:54.430
And how do you
propose to do that?

01:00:54.432 --> 01:00:57.633
By becoming the most
valuable dog in the show.

01:00:57.635 --> 01:00:59.101
You mean you...

01:00:59.103 --> 01:01:01.438
I'm gonna have Gabriel
steal me.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.505
Max, what if you actually
won the whole show?

01:01:03.507 --> 01:01:06.443
Then you'd be able to lead us right
to Ling Li. What do you say, partner?

01:01:06.445 --> 01:01:08.478
Well, it's official.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.246
Max has a partner.
He so has a partner.

01:01:11.248 --> 01:01:14.117
Hey, you do remember
I bite, right?

01:01:14.119 --> 01:01:17.119
You will need more than sharp
teeth to win this competition.

01:01:17.121 --> 01:01:19.557
And the finals are tonight.
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>

01:01:20.692 --> 01:01:22.628

No, you cannot wear that
hideous fashion faux pas.

01:03:14.206 --> 01:03:16.873
This collar has a GPS in it.

01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:19.108
- Good luck, Mr. Upstill.
- Thank you very much.

01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:21.811
After I win,
I let Gabriel steal me.

01:03:21.813 --> 01:03:23.479
Then Frank will
track me to Ling Li.

01:03:23.481 --> 01:03:25.782
So your life may depend

01:03:25.784 --> 01:03:27.282
Yep.

01:03:27.284 --> 01:03:29.318
Not worth it.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.157
Oh, there we go. Okay.

Hey, so I, uh...

01:03:51.909 --> 01:03:54.744
Not now, Max. I've got a
dumb dog show to focus on.

01:03:54.746 --> 01:03:55.845
Wait. Daisy, wait.

01:04:04.489 --> 01:04:06.356
Okay. Thank you.

infamous for her hashtag
"chow power,"

the winner
of the exotic group, chow...

01:04:22.574 --> 01:04:23.840
Don't bite me.

01:04:23.842 --> 01:04:25.874
Listen, Chauncey.

01:04:25.876 --> 01:04:28.746
Time, she gives us
the perspective.

01:04:30.581 --> 01:04:32.815
Still, this must be said.

01:04:32.817 --> 01:04:36.251
What happened between us
was not all your fault.

01:04:36.253 --> 01:04:39.222
Perhaps had I more confidence,

01:04:39.224 --> 01:04:40.657
I would have stopped
the madness.

01:04:40.659 --> 01:04:43.559
But, alas, I was not able.

01:04:43.561 --> 01:04:48.363
Now life has taken us
on separate paths,

01:04:48.365 --> 01:04:49.766
and I accept it.

01:04:49.768 --> 01:04:53.503
I am done living
with the resentments.

01:04:53.505 --> 01:04:56.842
I wish you <i>bon chance,</i>
my friend.

01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:03.845
Philippe, you are
the finest competitor

01:05:03.847 --> 01:05:06.451
I ever had the honor
of working with.

01:05:14.525 --> 01:05:17.793
What are you doing? Get my
masters hand off you right now.

01:05:17.795 --> 01:05:19.729
Yap, yap, yap.

01:05:19.731 --> 01:05:21.597
- And next...
- Should have stuck with papillons.

01:05:21.599 --> 01:05:23.333
...five-time winner
of Best in Show,

01:05:23.335 --> 01:05:25.767
your champion...

01:05:25.769 --> 01:05:28.438
Chauncey Middleton.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.340
And the winner
of the toy group,

01:05:30.342 --> 01:05:34.943
Yorkshire terrier
numero uno, Dante!

01:05:34.945 --> 01:05:36.878
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.616
It's me.
Paparazzi, this way.

01:05:43.021 --> 01:05:46.322
You know, I was watching
you and Max at practice today.

01:05:46.324 --> 01:05:48.523
- You guys have both come a really long way.
- Thanks.

01:05:48.525 --> 01:05:49.858
Yeah.

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.463
Look, Mattie, I figured out
who the smuggler is.

01:05:53.465 --> 01:05:55.898
- And I need you to keep an open mind.
- Okay.

01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.867
And the winner
of the working group...

01:05:57.869 --> 01:05:59.034
We can talk
about it after.

01:05:59.036 --> 01:06:00.769
...first-time competitor...

01:06:00.771 --> 01:06:02.771
Come on, buddy.
Let's win this thing.

01:06:02.773 --> 01:06:05.775
...a fan favorite
here at the Canini.

01:06:05.777 --> 01:06:08.344
What will he do next?

01:06:08.346 --> 01:06:12.315
The rottweiler Max!

01:06:15.019 --> 01:06:17.753
And the winner
of the herding group,

01:06:17.755 --> 01:06:20.722
a delight
with a pep in her step,

01:06:20.724 --> 01:06:23.860
the Australian Shepherd, Daisy,

01:06:23.862 --> 01:06:25.662
and her handler,

01:06:25.664 --> 01:06:27.496
three-time winner,

01:06:27.498 --> 01:06:29.834
Mattie Smith!

01:06:30.934 --> 01:06:32.635
And there you have it.

01:06:32.637 --> 01:06:37.407
These are the most successful
show dogs in the world.

01:06:37.409 --> 01:06:40.342
- Canine crème de la crème.
- Thank you.

01:06:40.344 --> 01:06:41.711
So before the announcement

01:06:41.713 --> 01:06:44.579
of this year's
Canini Supreme Champion,

01:06:44.581 --> 01:06:48.050
there's just one more hurdle.

01:06:48.052 --> 01:06:50.586
The judge's inspection.

01:06:50.588 --> 01:06:51.787

01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:53.690

Good to see you, Alex.

01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:00.496
Fabulous condition.

01:07:00.498 --> 01:07:01.930
<i>♪ Girl, look at that body ♪</i>

01:07:01.932 --> 01:07:03.599

- <i>♪ I'm sexy and I know it ♪</i>
- You did it!

01:08:00.824 --> 01:08:04.797
This is it,
the moment of truth.

01:08:06.063 --> 01:08:08.130
Which dog will be crowned

01:08:08.132 --> 01:08:14.103
this year's Canini Invitational
Champion of Champions?

01:08:14.105 --> 01:08:16.872
The winner,
Best in Show, number one.

01:08:16.875 --> 01:08:21.977
This year's Canini
Invitational champion, Daisy!

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:23.915
- Yeah!
- I did it!

01:08:25.082 --> 01:08:27.984
She won.
She really did it.

01:08:34.024 --> 01:08:36.560
Thank you. Thank you.

01:08:37.962 --> 01:08:39.528
- Thank you.
- Unbelievable.

01:08:39.529 --> 01:08:41.798
You just cost me
three million pounds.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:44.032
What? You were
going to sell me?

01:08:44.033 --> 01:08:45.535
Chauncey, wait!

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:47.372
It was all her.

01:08:48.506 --> 01:08:49.805
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, no.

01:08:49.807 --> 01:08:52.541
All right, buddy.

01:08:52.542 --> 01:08:54.176
We'd better warn Mattie
that Daisy's in danger.

01:08:54.179 --> 01:08:55.944
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Come on.

01:08:55.947 --> 01:08:58.548
Miss Smith, would you
and your dog kindly allow me

01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:00.183
to escort you
to the press room?

01:09:00.185 --> 01:09:01.983
Of course. Come on, baby.

01:09:01.984 --> 01:09:03.553
- Follow me.
- Come on.

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:04.821
- Excuse us.
- Here we go.

01:09:04.823 --> 01:09:06.457
Excuse me. Mattie?

01:09:09.461 --> 01:09:11.160
- Where'd they go?
- Mattie!

01:09:11.162 --> 01:09:12.727
Hey!

01:09:12.729 --> 01:09:15.063
- Mattie!
- Sure. Thank you.

01:09:15.064 --> 01:09:16.131
Excuse me. Mattie!

01:09:16.134 --> 01:09:17.200
Daisy!

01:09:17.202 --> 01:09:18.569
Let me go!

01:09:19.737 --> 01:09:21.837
Daisy.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.706
Mattie. Are you okay?
What happened?

01:09:24.707 --> 01:09:25.743
Where's Daisy?

01:09:27.109 --> 01:09:28.910
Daisy!

01:09:28.912 --> 01:09:31.115
Daisy!

01:09:33.015 --> 01:09:34.216
- Come on.
- Where is she?

01:09:34.219 --> 01:09:36.051
Max, come on.

01:09:36.054 --> 01:09:37.919
- Oh, this is tragic.
- Wait. What?

01:09:37.921 --> 01:09:40.622
The love of his life
ripped out of his paws.

01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:42.991
- Thrown in a van. Hey!
- Oh!

01:09:42.993 --> 01:09:45.627
- Is the big chase about to start?
- Wait. What did you just say?

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:47.529
Hey, is the...

01:09:47.532 --> 01:09:49.130
- No, about the van.
- Sorry.

01:09:49.131 --> 01:09:51.099
- Where did they go?
- That way.

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.870
I never thought I'd say this,
but I need backup.

01:09:53.872 --> 01:09:55.271
Sure thing, Maxi.

01:09:55.273 --> 01:09:57.874
Should we, uh, call someone?

01:09:57.876 --> 01:10:00.576
No, you.
I need eyes in the sky.

01:10:00.578 --> 01:10:04.112
- Yes!
- Pigeon PD on the case!

01:10:04.114 --> 01:10:05.882
- Ooh!
- Regroup!

01:10:05.884 --> 01:10:08.951
Here, take my collar. Find
the van and drop it on top.

01:10:08.953 --> 01:10:11.521
- Yeah!
- Our first case.

01:10:11.523 --> 01:10:14.290
Oh! It feels
like we're real cops.

01:10:14.292 --> 01:10:17.559
Oh, yes. We finally get
to use our catchphrase.

01:10:17.561 --> 01:10:19.528
Birds of a feather...

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:21.533
...fight crime together!

01:10:24.068 --> 01:10:26.635
- Max, what are you waiting for?
- Max, get in.

01:10:26.637 --> 01:10:28.236
Hey, what happened to your collar?

01:10:28.238 --> 01:10:30.171
It's Max's GPS.
It's moving.

01:10:30.173 --> 01:10:32.674
- But how?
- No idea.

01:10:32.676 --> 01:10:34.045
Shall we follow it?
Get in.

01:10:37.814 --> 01:10:38.513
Bye, Max!

01:10:38.515 --> 01:10:40.782
<i>Bon chance,</i>
my friends!

01:10:40.784 --> 01:10:42.919
I'm gonna miss him so much.

01:10:42.921 --> 01:10:46.289
We was home dogs,
you know? Tight.

01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:48.190
He was my worst student,
you know.

01:10:48.192 --> 01:10:50.660
Yet I have never
been more proud.

01:10:50.662 --> 01:10:54.263
I'm proud to be
a deputy to a real cop.

01:10:54.265 --> 01:10:56.866
Speaking of,
we must continue our duties.

01:10:56.868 --> 01:11:00.702
Perhaps by investigating
the after-party?

01:11:00.704 --> 01:11:01.970
Ah, heck, yeah.

01:11:01.972 --> 01:11:04.272
I'm gonna solve the case
of the blue frosting.

01:11:04.274 --> 01:11:08.910
Oh, how are we supposed to find an
unmarked van in all of Las Vegas?

01:11:08.912 --> 01:11:11.046
Simple, Midge.
We'll just...

01:11:11.048 --> 01:11:12.113
Whoa!

01:11:14.985 --> 01:11:16.889
Okay, now it's going that way.

01:11:19.023 --> 01:11:21.022
No, no, no, wait.
It's all over the place.

01:11:21.024 --> 01:11:22.991
- This is nuts.
- Yeah, I know.

01:11:22.993 --> 01:11:24.960
- But this is...
- ...our only chance to save Daisy.

01:11:24.962 --> 01:11:26.227
Hey, hey.
There it is.

01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:27.929
Pigeon PD, dive.

01:11:27.931 --> 01:11:29.665
Eagle's Claw, go in.

01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:31.666
Roger, roger,
Captain Condor.

01:11:31.668 --> 01:11:33.102
I thought
I was Eagle's Claw.

01:11:33.104 --> 01:11:34.903
No. You're Falcon.

01:11:34.905 --> 01:11:38.374
I can't be Falcon. Falcons
ate my entire family.

01:11:38.376 --> 01:11:40.244
- Oh, right.
- Moment of silence.

01:11:42.279 --> 01:11:45.781
And we're back.
You can be Greg.

01:11:45.783 --> 01:11:47.383
I like that.

01:11:47.385 --> 01:11:49.785
Ooh! I'm getting
pigeon bumps.

01:11:49.787 --> 01:11:54.022
Okay, Greg. It's time for you to watch
Midge drop the collar on the van.

01:11:54.024 --> 01:11:55.758
- Wait. What?
- Go, Midge, go.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.393
Roger that, Captain Condor.

01:11:57.395 --> 01:11:59.695
Take that, bad guy.

01:11:59.697 --> 01:12:02.768
Birds of a feather
fight crime together!

01:12:03.935 --> 01:12:05.968
It locked in.
Three blocks over.

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:07.135
Yeah, I can't.

01:12:07.137 --> 01:12:08.838
I can't, Max.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.839
- Left. Turn left.
- He's on Fremont.

01:12:10.841 --> 01:12:12.775
- Turn left. Frank.
- I can't, Max.

01:12:12.777 --> 01:12:14.376
- I said hang a Louie.
- He's on Fremont.

01:12:14.378 --> 01:12:17.045
- Do you not see the buildings over there?
- What is going on?

01:12:17.047 --> 01:12:18.981
- Hang a Louie!
- Frank!

01:12:18.983 --> 01:12:20.650
He wants me to turn left!

01:12:20.652 --> 01:12:22.785
Whoa! Whoa!

01:12:36.234 --> 01:12:39.771
- No, Max!
- You had your chance. Now I'm driving.

01:12:41.238 --> 01:12:42.306
Huh? Huh?

01:12:44.108 --> 01:12:46.311
Frank!

01:12:52.283 --> 01:12:53.885
Whoa!

01:12:55.386 --> 01:12:57.689
- Sorry, ma'am!
- Sorry!

01:13:09.734 --> 01:13:12.201
Okay, all right, it looks like
they're headed to an airport.

01:13:12.203 --> 01:13:13.338
Come on, Max.

01:13:21.279 --> 01:13:23.344
Congratulations
to the champion.

01:13:23.346 --> 01:13:26.816
I hope you enjoy your new
breeding mill in the Ukraine.

01:13:30.188 --> 01:13:32.754
Put her with the other merchandise
while I get the plane ready.

01:13:32.756 --> 01:13:34.358
I owe you one, Daisy.

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.492
The package is ready.

01:13:37.494 --> 01:13:39.394
I told you to trust me.

01:13:39.396 --> 01:13:41.867
Yeah, I'll be there.

01:13:43.367 --> 01:13:46.902
Okay, it's in there.

01:13:46.904 --> 01:13:49.437
Wait, wait. Mattie, maybe you should
stay in here where it's safer,

01:13:49.439 --> 01:13:51.874
and you can call
the cops, all right?

01:13:51.876 --> 01:13:53.476
My partner and I
are going in.

01:13:53.478 --> 01:13:55.376
Bad boys for life.

01:13:55.378 --> 01:13:57.079
You, stay there.

01:13:57.081 --> 01:13:59.482
I'll deal with you later.

01:13:59.484 --> 01:14:02.117
Hello, fellow captive.

01:14:02.119 --> 01:14:05.120
My name is Deepak.

01:14:05.122 --> 01:14:08.223
- How long have you been here?
- Too long, <i>bitiya.</i>

01:14:08.225 --> 01:14:09.161
Too long.

01:14:18.970 --> 01:14:20.038
All right.

01:14:29.412 --> 01:14:32.250
Huh. What are you
waiting for, Hooch?

01:14:42.993 --> 01:14:46.461
Hey, Deepak.
Got you a little appetizer.

01:14:46.463 --> 01:14:48.563
Enjoy.

01:14:48.565 --> 01:14:51.769
- Hello, my little furry friend.
- Oh.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.572
Oh.

01:14:57.574 --> 01:14:59.308
What is this now?

01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:01.179
What are you doing?

01:15:04.849 --> 01:15:08.286
Well, this just
got interesting.

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.142
- Start loading the animals.
- Yes, boss. I'm on it.

01:15:41.018 --> 01:15:43.221
Oh. Too easy.

01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:47.589
Hey, Berne.

01:15:56.266 --> 01:15:57.335
Oh.

01:16:00.503 --> 01:16:02.239
No. Daisy.

01:16:07.345 --> 01:16:09.014
Wellington Upstill.

01:16:10.247 --> 01:16:13.184
Or should I say
Agent Nicholas, FBI?

01:16:16.887 --> 01:16:18.553
I'll take my panda back.

01:16:18.555 --> 01:16:20.357
This is great.

01:16:21.492 --> 01:16:24.393
Really? How's that?

01:16:24.395 --> 01:16:27.963
The justice system rarely does
anything to people who harm animals,

01:16:27.965 --> 01:16:31.666
but shoot a fed and you're
gonna get what you deserve.

01:16:34.005 --> 01:16:36.205
For the $10 million
I'm gonna get for the panda,

01:16:36.207 --> 01:16:38.143
I think I'm gonna
take my chances.

01:16:49.052 --> 01:16:50.154
Who's driving the plane?

01:16:51.521 --> 01:16:53.488
- Do you know how to fly this thing?
- No.

01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:55.057
But I am friends
with three pigeons.

01:16:55.059 --> 01:16:56.291
Whoa! Look out!

01:16:56.293 --> 01:16:57.561
- Ruh-roh.
- Turn!

01:16:58.462 --> 01:16:59.397
Whoa!

01:17:01.431 --> 01:17:04.232
Stop it.
Just stop it.

01:17:04.234 --> 01:17:06.936
- Come back here.
- Welcome to Max Air, amigo.

01:17:06.938 --> 01:17:09.571
Prepare for takedown. Hey,
grab the stick while I just...

01:17:09.573 --> 01:17:12.340
Not a chance. Me and sardine breath
have some unfinished business.

01:17:12.342 --> 01:17:15.110
I'm coming for you now.

01:17:15.112 --> 01:17:17.545
- Daisy, be careful.
- What, not to break a nail?

01:17:17.547 --> 01:17:18.916
Here's the kibbles.

01:17:19.984 --> 01:17:21.419
And here's the bits.

01:17:24.387 --> 01:17:26.455
- Whoa. You're pretty good.
- For a lame show dog?

01:17:26.457 --> 01:17:28.493
Yeah, I got skills.

01:17:33.296 --> 01:17:35.097
Airline food
has really gone to the dogs.

01:17:35.099 --> 01:17:36.067
Ha-ha!

01:17:37.969 --> 01:17:39.371
Uh-oh.
We got trouble on our tail.

01:17:58.989 --> 01:18:00.621
Max, you've gotta
stop this thing.

01:18:00.623 --> 01:18:03.528
I didn't exactly have time
to study the owners' manual.

01:18:11.002 --> 01:18:12.470
Mattie!

01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:16.205
Karma! Help me!

01:18:16.207 --> 01:18:19.375
Would that I could, but, you know,
the whole nonviolent thing.

01:18:19.377 --> 01:18:20.742
Pups for peace.

01:18:36.027 --> 01:18:38.128
Do you really think
that you can...

01:18:41.765 --> 01:18:43.398
You're welcome.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.037
I had him right where I wanted him.

01:18:47.171 --> 01:18:48.673
Frank.

01:18:51.809 --> 01:18:54.179
Ling Li?

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.415
Max, fetch!

01:18:59.417 --> 01:19:03.154
Okay, but just this once.
Hang on, kid! I'm coming!

01:19:07.757 --> 01:19:10.625
Gotcha.

01:19:10.627 --> 01:19:12.260
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

01:19:12.262 --> 01:19:13.163
- Uh-oh.
- Aah!

01:19:28.078 --> 01:19:30.478
Max.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.813
- Nice throw, Hooch.
- You did it.

01:19:31.815 --> 01:19:34.316
You did it, buddy. You saved Ling Li.
You are amazing.

01:19:34.318 --> 01:19:36.218
- Next time, you fetch.
- Good job.

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:38.687
- You guys were all amazing.
- Are you kidding?

01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:40.688
Everyone's amazing!

01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:42.590
Oh. Oh, buddy.

01:19:42.592 --> 01:19:44.826
Bear tongue, scratchy.

01:19:44.828 --> 01:19:45.794
Oh, no.

01:19:45.796 --> 01:19:47.132
Dang!

01:20:00.377 --> 01:20:02.311
Son of a...
You know what?

01:20:02.313 --> 01:20:05.546
We can call the Bureau and they'll
track the plane. Thanks, buddy.

01:20:05.548 --> 01:20:07.749
Hey, that's
what partners are for.

01:20:07.751 --> 01:20:09.351
This is Agent Nichols
requesting...

01:20:09.353 --> 01:20:12.454
I'm impressed,
Mr. NYPD Officer.

01:20:12.456 --> 01:20:14.723
You weren't bad yourself,
Miss Best in Show.

01:20:14.725 --> 01:20:16.325
Thanks, Max.

01:20:16.327 --> 01:20:19.128
Look, about what I said
on the rooftop...

01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:22.363
- It's okay, Max.
- No. No, it's not.

01:20:22.365 --> 01:20:26.634
Truth is I've been disrespecting everybody
and everything since I got here.

01:20:26.636 --> 01:20:30.539
You, Philippe,
Frank most of all.

01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:34.175
But everything works out
a whole lot better

01:20:34.177 --> 01:20:36.344
when you can learn
to trust people

01:20:36.346 --> 01:20:38.280
who see the world
in a different way.

01:20:38.282 --> 01:20:40.749
Sorry it took me so long
to figure that out.

01:20:40.751 --> 01:20:43.751
Wow. Okay, who are you,
and what did you do with Max?

01:20:43.753 --> 01:20:46.287
Oh, I'm sure he'll be back
before you know it.

01:20:46.289 --> 01:20:48.824
Hey, what happened
to that tiger?

01:20:48.826 --> 01:20:50.561
Tiger? What tiger?

01:21:00.404 --> 01:21:03.405
He thought he
was gonna catch me.

01:21:03.407 --> 01:21:05.440
How you doing?

01:21:05.442 --> 01:21:07.843
I suggest you fasten
your seat belt.

01:21:14.851 --> 01:21:17.251
And now for some happy news.

01:21:17.253 --> 01:21:20.421
It was panda-monium
at the Beijing Zoo today

01:21:20.423 --> 01:21:24.860
<i>as baby Ling Li was reunited with her
mother after a terrifying ordeal.</i>

01:21:24.862 --> 01:21:27.795
<i>After the arrest

01:21:36.239 --> 01:21:38.206
- <i>a pygmy three-toed sloth...</i>
- Good idea. Thank you, Max.

01:21:38.208 --> 01:21:39.575
<i>...and an albino python.</i>

01:21:39.577 --> 01:21:40.909
All right,
let's eat.

01:21:40.911 --> 01:21:43.844
- What is it?
- It's my specialty.

01:21:43.846 --> 01:21:46.415
It's actually the only thing I
know how to make. It's kebabs.

01:21:46.417 --> 01:21:47.616
All right,
that's fair.

01:21:47.618 --> 01:21:49.585
Wow.
Look at us now.

01:21:49.587 --> 01:21:51.419
Top birds
on the force.

01:21:51.421 --> 01:21:55.523
That's right, Midge. We pretty much
taught Max everything he knows.

01:21:55.525 --> 01:21:58.360
I kind of feel
like a father to him.

01:21:58.362 --> 01:22:02.731
One day future generations of
pigeons will poop on statues of us.

01:22:02.733 --> 01:22:04.266
- Aw!
- Awesome.

01:22:04.268 --> 01:22:06.602
You know, Daisy is safe
because of us.

01:22:06.604 --> 01:22:08.870
The panda is safe
because of us.

01:22:08.872 --> 01:22:10.938
The tiger is safe
because of...

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:13.241
Whatever happened
to that tiger?

01:22:13.243 --> 01:22:17.214
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Now, this
really is the life of Pi!

01:22:18.314 --> 01:22:19.483
Yeah, Chief.

01:22:20.451 --> 01:22:21.916
Okay, got it.

01:22:21.918 --> 01:22:24.285
Come on. Let's go, Max.
I'm sorry.

01:22:24.287 --> 01:22:26.456
- Exotic animal sighting, 5th and Garfield.
- Okay.

01:22:30.027 --> 01:22:32.628
Look, I'm trying
to run a business here.

01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:35.429
I went in there with the towels.
I don't know what I saw.

01:22:35.431 --> 01:22:36.768
Gotcha.

01:22:39.737 --> 01:22:41.436
I better go first. You watch my six.

01:22:41.438 --> 01:22:42.638
I got seniority.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.406
Fine, but I'm older than you.

01:22:44.408 --> 01:22:46.544
Don't give me a bunch of stuff
about dog years.

01:22:48.712 --> 01:22:50.812
- Max.
- Maxwell!

01:22:50.814 --> 01:22:55.284
It turns out you were not the
only undercover cop at the show.

01:22:55.286 --> 01:22:56.351
Hello, Max.

01:22:56.353 --> 01:22:57.451
Persephone?

01:22:57.453 --> 01:22:59.588
Special Agent Persephone.

01:22:59.590 --> 01:23:00.955
Homeland Security.

01:23:00.957 --> 01:23:03.692
I knew my little charade
would bring you here.

01:23:03.694 --> 01:23:06.995
Plot twist.
The Jacuzzi was my idea.

01:23:06.997 --> 01:23:09.330
Ha-ha!
Totally random, right?

01:23:09.332 --> 01:23:11.366
You and Frank
were impressive in Vegas,

01:23:11.368 --> 01:23:14.702
but are you prepared
to take it to the next level?

01:23:14.704 --> 01:23:16.504
A team of crime fighters.

01:23:16.506 --> 01:23:18.607
With license to bite.

01:23:18.609 --> 01:23:21.910
I may just have your
next assignment, darlings.

01:23:21.912 --> 01:23:22.977
Yes!

01:23:22.979 --> 01:23:25.349
Here we go again.

01:23:40.029 --> 01:23:42.897

- It's all right.

01:23:42.899 --> 01:23:46.434
I know it's your favorite jacket, man.
I'm so sorry about that.

01:23:46.436 --> 01:23:49.737
Did you just wipe dog slobber on that guy?
Really, Will Arnett?

01:23:49.739 --> 01:23:53.407

Woof, woof, woof!

That is not in the script.

01:24:08.725 --> 01:24:11.360
- What's a script?
- I don't know.

01:24:11.362 --> 01:24:13.794
I'm not an expert in canine mental
disorders. I'm an FBI agent.
