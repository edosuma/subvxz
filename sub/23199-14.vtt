WEBVTT

00:09.343 --> 00:13.472
Enter Mariposa.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.518
The good old U.S. of A.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.230
The scenery, beautiful as ever.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.441
What was it Gen. MacArthur said?

00:25.400 --> 00:28.236
"I have returned. "

00:31.740 --> 00:32.991
First...

00:34.075 --> 00:37.954
so as not to spoil my homecoming...

00:39.206 --> 00:42.834
I think I'll send a little box of candy...

00:43.543 --> 00:47.255
to my old friend Diana Prince.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.884
Some bomb-bombs.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

03:49.311 --> 03:52.147
Hello, Mom? Yeah, this is Bill.

03:52.731 --> 03:54.482
No, nothing's wrong.

03:55.191 --> 03:58.611
No, I got a message to call you
from this phone booth.

03:59.279 --> 04:01.865
Yeah, it did sound kind of crazy.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.035
You didn't?

05:19.984 --> 05:24.488
Welcome to Mariposalia, Bill Berthoud.

05:36.458 --> 05:37.918
Behave yourself...

05:39.003 --> 05:43.299
and nothing will happen to you
or your dear mother.

06:35.183 --> 06:38.186
I wasn't expecting you.
What do you think?

06:39.229 --> 06:40.647
You really swing.

06:41.398 --> 06:42.941
What does that mean?

06:43.817 --> 06:45.569
Nothing. Everything. I don't know.

06:45.652 --> 06:47.028
Nadia, marry me.

06:49.072 --> 06:50.532
Not right now.

07:07.716 --> 07:09.759
- What is it?
- I don't know.

07:11.219 --> 07:14.055
You seem frightened.
You always seem frightened.

07:14.222 --> 07:15.348
Because I am.

07:15.432 --> 07:16.558
Why?

07:18.226 --> 07:20.895
Baby, it's been over a year
since you defected.

07:20.979 --> 07:24.315
The spies, the secret police,
they're ancient history now.

07:24.607 --> 07:26.109
Not for me.

07:26.860 --> 07:30.321
I know you think I'm paranoid but...

07:30.613 --> 07:32.365
I am being followed...

07:32.740 --> 07:36.202
wherever I go,
and it's not the secret police.

07:37.495 --> 07:39.914
Put an end to the paranoia then.
Marry me.

07:39.998 --> 07:41.833
You're not listening to me.

07:45.962 --> 07:48.464
Okay, who do you think is following you?

07:50.341 --> 07:51.843
I don't know.

08:04.397 --> 08:05.815
Nadia Samara.

08:07.483 --> 08:09.860
She is absolutely the finest?

08:10.403 --> 08:13.739
Top pick, AP, UPl, and Reuters.

08:14.156 --> 08:16.784
Gold medals in Amsterdam, Zurich,
Johannesburg...

08:16.867 --> 08:19.286
Pan-American Games,
Scandinavian Games.

08:19.370 --> 08:20.454
None better.

08:20.538 --> 08:22.289
She defected a year ago.

08:22.748 --> 08:24.333
That's her boyfriend.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.335
They're getting married.

08:26.419 --> 08:28.462
A guaranteed gold medal.

08:29.422 --> 08:32.299
A guaranteed Olympic champion.

08:34.009 --> 08:35.469
No guarantees.

08:35.803 --> 08:38.347
You've read her stats.
She's the best in the world...

08:38.429 --> 08:42.142
at this moment, but no guarantees.

08:45.771 --> 08:48.274
She's breaking training, Eric.

08:48.482 --> 08:52.653
Bring her in. It's time she joined our team.

09:20.514 --> 09:23.559
You said the meeting was urgent.
You said nothing about formal.

09:23.642 --> 09:26.728
You're dressed fine
for what you'll be doing tonight.

09:27.646 --> 09:28.897
Something tells me...

09:28.981 --> 09:32.526
that I'm not going to spend the weekend
at home in front of my fireplace.

09:32.609 --> 09:36.822
- That's right. Two things. First-
- Marion Mariposa is back.

09:37.447 --> 09:40.075
- How did you know that?
- He sent me a little present.

09:40.158 --> 09:42.160
- The hello-goodbye type.
- What?

09:42.369 --> 09:44.955
It was nothing I couldn't handle.
What's second?

09:45.038 --> 09:46.373
Second...

09:47.374 --> 09:49.626
you recognize any of these athletes?

09:50.877 --> 09:52.170
By reputation.

09:52.254 --> 09:55.006
You know what they have in common,
other than the obvious?

09:55.090 --> 09:56.466
Breakfast cereal.

09:57.884 --> 09:59.844
Seriously. They're all missing.

09:59.928 --> 10:03.431
The Olympic Committee came up with an
"address unknown" on all of them.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.976
None of them have signed
their letter of intent.

10:06.059 --> 10:08.269
Someone's undermining the Olympics?

10:08.603 --> 10:10.063
It looks that way.

10:11.439 --> 10:13.400
Okay, where do I start?

10:13.650 --> 10:16.903
All the missing athletes
were in or around the Los Angeles area...

10:16.986 --> 10:18.780
when they disappeared.

10:20.198 --> 10:22.867
Here are your tickets.
Flight leaves at 6 a. m.

10:24.077 --> 10:27.997
And all this time, I thought
you were going to invite me to the ball.

10:30.124 --> 10:31.876
It would be nice...

10:32.168 --> 10:35.588
but I got hooked into escorting
a Lithuanian countess...

10:35.672 --> 10:37.590
to the Senate dance tonight.

10:37.924 --> 10:39.217
Poor you.

10:39.425 --> 10:42.428
I've seen that Lithuanian countess.
She's gorgeous.

10:42.637 --> 10:44.347
I really am late, Diana.

10:44.722 --> 10:46.724
I'll have more for you on this tomorrow.

10:46.808 --> 10:48.309
I'll talk to you then. Bye.

10:48.393 --> 10:50.436
Good night.

11:00.113 --> 11:01.656
What is your problem?

11:01.739 --> 11:05.243
A number of future Olympic game
competitors can't be located.

11:11.958 --> 11:16.921
Mino Gallegos. Arthur Lopez.
Medora Ritoli. Bill Berthoud.

11:17.004 --> 11:19.674
Spyros Voker. Regis Crawford.

11:19.757 --> 11:20.967
Thank you, Ira.

11:21.050 --> 11:24.136
My assignment is to locate
these men and women.

11:24.428 --> 11:28.057
I do not know where they are.
But I do know who will disappear next.

11:28.140 --> 11:29.225
Who?

11:29.809 --> 11:31.352
Nadia Samara.

11:31.685 --> 11:35.106
The gymnast who defected?
I met her in Munich.

11:35.189 --> 11:38.442
Her disappearance will have nothing to do
With her defection.

11:38.526 --> 11:39.985
What will it have to do with?

11:40.069 --> 11:43.197
Insufficient data prevents me
from knowing the reason.

11:44.532 --> 11:47.785
Okay, Ira. Thank you anyway. Good night.

11:49.161 --> 11:52.248
Please give my regards
to Wonder Woman, Diana Prince.

12:07.679 --> 12:09.848
Wrist down, fingers high.

12:10.224 --> 12:12.935
Elbows in, back straight.

12:16.021 --> 12:19.900
Wrist down, fingers high. Good.

12:21.568 --> 12:22.945
Your Excellency.

12:23.695 --> 12:26.240
I take it you've lowered the flag, Eric.

12:26.323 --> 12:27.866
It's right here.

12:28.325 --> 12:30.953
- Folded it properly?
- Just like you told me.

12:31.703 --> 12:32.788
Good.

12:35.540 --> 12:38.251
Is there some trouble
with the recruits, Eric?

12:38.335 --> 12:40.253
Nothing out of the ordinary.

12:40.587 --> 12:43.131
Then why are you hovering?

12:45.175 --> 12:47.886
I just heard an ugly rumor
about Diana Prince.

12:50.055 --> 12:53.225
The late Diana Prince, you mean.

12:53.558 --> 12:55.227
No, I'm afraid I don't.

12:56.978 --> 13:00.899
I told you it was ugly.
Somehow she survived the bomb.

13:02.192 --> 13:05.570
Ms. Prince's ability
to survive dire circumstances...

13:05.779 --> 13:08.073
is surpassed only by mine.

13:08.823 --> 13:12.410
Her presence continues
to complicate matters.

13:12.786 --> 13:15.330
The people coming in tomorrow
can handle her.

13:15.413 --> 13:17.582
I'm told they're tops in their field.

13:17.666 --> 13:18.792
Which is?

13:19.209 --> 13:20.335
Disposal.

13:24.172 --> 13:27.133
Well put, Eric.

13:37.685 --> 13:40.605
So I said, "I can't be in the
cafeteria baking cookies...

13:40.688 --> 13:42.398
"and run the booth at the same time. "

13:42.482 --> 13:44.400
Anyway, who would I get for a babysitter?

13:44.484 --> 13:46.945
I just don't let just anyone watch my kids,
you know.

13:47.028 --> 13:48.780
- You got kids, Diana?
- No.

13:49.447 --> 13:51.324
Thanks. Hold this, please.

13:53.701 --> 13:55.244
Thank you very much.

13:55.453 --> 13:59.290
Well, it certainly has been
a pleasure talking to you, Lois.

13:59.374 --> 14:02.794
You, too, honey.
Your bag's not down yet, huh?

14:03.628 --> 14:04.712
No.

14:05.755 --> 14:07.799
- Someone meeting you?
- No.

14:07.882 --> 14:10.635
- You want to share cab fare into town?
- I'm renting a car.

14:10.718 --> 14:11.802
Terrific!

14:12.261 --> 14:15.765
Listen, why don't you giving me a lift?
I just live in the Valley.

14:15.848 --> 14:17.350
I'm going downtown.

14:17.433 --> 14:19.644
What a shame.
I could have shown you the way.

14:19.727 --> 14:21.646
Los Angeles is my town, you know.

14:21.729 --> 14:24.190
Seventeen, I used to stop traffic.

14:24.273 --> 14:26.651
Now I'm lucky if I don't get run over.

14:27.485 --> 14:29.737
- Bye.
- Bye.

14:58.223 --> 15:00.768
You and your partner
come very well recommended.

15:00.851 --> 15:04.313
We believe the only good customer
is a satisfied one.

15:05.147 --> 15:07.858
We're also told your services
are expensive.

15:09.526 --> 15:11.737
It's a seller's market, isn't it?

15:13.113 --> 15:16.909
Ifyou can find somebody more qualified
and less expensive to do the job...

15:16.992 --> 15:20.120
you'd hire them, but you won't.
Because there's not.

15:20.788 --> 15:21.955
Higher.

15:22.039 --> 15:24.500
$50,000. $25,000 in front...

15:24.583 --> 15:28.170
and $25,000 when we deliver.

15:28.378 --> 15:29.463
No problem.

15:29.546 --> 15:32.466
Anyone you hire will ha ve to come out
of your end.

15:33.383 --> 15:35.677
The price includes everything...

15:36.386 --> 15:39.264
or, anything as the case may be.

15:39.723 --> 15:41.141
I'm glad you said that.

15:41.224 --> 15:44.895
We've learned that the IADC
has begun to show interest.

15:45.020 --> 15:46.146
Yes.

15:46.438 --> 15:49.983
I believe they've sent Diana Prince
to protect the little lady.

15:50.067 --> 15:52.069
And what will you do about it?

15:52.903 --> 15:54.613
Kill her.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.975
Still here, Mr. Taggart?

16:25.018 --> 16:29.439
Didn't Eric tell you I expect you
to carry out my assignments immediately?

16:30.940 --> 16:34.152
He made it perfectly clear
you wanted no mistakes.

16:34.486 --> 16:38.031
My assistant had to make
certain arrangements.

16:40.074 --> 16:41.618
If you'll forgive me for asking...

16:41.701 --> 16:45.163
what's a guy like you want
with all these athletes anyway?

16:48.041 --> 16:49.125
Guy?

16:51.794 --> 16:54.797
Did you call me "guy"?

16:57.175 --> 16:58.634
I am royalty.

16:59.677 --> 17:02.597
The emperor of a great country.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.182
Mariposalia.

17:08.019 --> 17:12.773
This globe... This tiny little globe...

17:13.816 --> 17:16.194
will show you the esteem with which...

17:16.277 --> 17:19.405
the international community
holds my country.

17:22.325 --> 17:24.410
Mariposalia isn't there.

17:30.166 --> 17:35.171
Can either of you tell me the colors
of Mariposalia's national flag?

17:38.007 --> 17:40.718
Can you hum our national anthem?

17:45.639 --> 17:48.601
Why is it that when the United Nations...

17:48.684 --> 17:51.312
sits to ponder the problems of the world...

17:53.439 --> 17:56.066
my ambassador's microphone
is never working?

18:00.279 --> 18:04.450
Why is it that the world knows
how much wheat...

18:04.533 --> 18:08.746
how many peanuts the United States
has to export each year?

18:09.538 --> 18:13.500
And yet no one can tell you
what my country has to offer.

18:14.168 --> 18:16.211
Why is that? Tell him, Eric!

18:17.046 --> 18:18.672
- Public-
- Relations.

18:19.089 --> 18:21.550
Public relations.

18:23.385 --> 18:28.348
Mariposalia evidently lacks an image.

18:29.766 --> 18:31.643
And what is it that a country can do...

18:31.727 --> 18:34.146
to build an image where none existed...

18:34.605 --> 18:38.025
to build one that will command
not only the attention of the world...

18:38.108 --> 18:39.943
but its admiration as well?

18:42.070 --> 18:45.449
It is to win the Olympics!

18:47.617 --> 18:50.996
The Olympic games
will bring my country...

18:51.371 --> 18:54.374
not only gold medals...

18:54.833 --> 18:58.920
but recognition and respect.

19:02.758 --> 19:05.719
I am inspired, Mr. Mariposa.

19:05.969 --> 19:08.138
Your Excellency.

19:10.182 --> 19:11.266
Right.

19:13.435 --> 19:15.562
If you will excuse me, I will see to it...

19:15.645 --> 19:20.108
that Nadia Samara gets started
on her extended vacation.

19:20.191 --> 19:22.861
You're going to get her
without your partner?

19:25.113 --> 19:27.449
This is the only partner that I need.

19:28.366 --> 19:30.118
For a while, anyway.

19:33.997 --> 19:35.457
Your Excellency.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.179
Who's there?

19:49.470 --> 19:50.722
Diana Prince.

19:51.723 --> 19:54.142
- Who?
- Diana Prince.

19:54.267 --> 19:56.436
We met in Munich, remember?

20:06.904 --> 20:08.072
What is it?

20:08.573 --> 20:11.409
I only know I'm in trouble,
more than in Munich.

20:11.534 --> 20:12.785
What happened?

20:13.161 --> 20:15.329
That's just it. Nothing happened.

20:16.080 --> 20:19.000
Someone is watching me. I know it.

20:19.083 --> 20:23.212
I don't know who. But I can feel his eyes,
like someone is behind the door...

20:23.296 --> 20:25.756
or in the next room, or walking behind me.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.718
It's like it was before, in the country I left.

20:29.218 --> 20:30.845
And I was right, wasn't I?

20:30.928 --> 20:33.973
I really must be in danger,
or you wouldn't be here.

20:34.557 --> 20:35.725
Come on, sit down.

20:35.808 --> 20:40.021
The IADC is just
a little bit concerned is all.

20:40.938 --> 20:43.357
I want you to leave the worrying to me.

20:43.524 --> 20:44.608
Okay?

20:46.610 --> 20:48.112
How did you know I was in danger?

20:48.195 --> 20:50.948
A friend. His name is Ira.

20:51.866 --> 20:53.492
I have an Ira also.

20:54.577 --> 20:58.497
My friend is computerized.
Yours sounds a little bit more special.

20:59.331 --> 21:00.708
What's his name?

21:01.500 --> 21:03.252
His name is Tom Hamilton.

21:03.544 --> 21:06.213
I met him at the university
where I work out.

21:06.881 --> 21:09.800
He's special, all right.
He wants to marry me.

21:09.883 --> 21:11.552
That's beautiful, Nadia.

21:11.635 --> 21:14.013
But I keep saying no...

21:15.723 --> 21:18.142
because of whatever is happening to me.

21:18.517 --> 21:20.227
Come on, honey.

21:22.187 --> 21:24.106
I told you to leave the worrying to me.

21:24.189 --> 21:26.650
You look a little tired.
Why don't you get some rest?

21:26.734 --> 21:28.736
- I will, Diana.
- Okay.

21:29.319 --> 21:30.946
You are going to stay?

21:31.113 --> 21:34.783
Yes, I'll be right here, curled up
with a good book or something.

21:35.534 --> 21:36.827
Lock your door.

23:06.708 --> 23:07.834
Nadia!

23:07.917 --> 23:10.169
Diana! No!

23:30.815 --> 23:34.527
- I'm being mugged!
- Stay right there!

23:38.781 --> 23:40.408
Stay right here.

23:51.544 --> 23:54.338
You saved my life. Thank you.

23:55.714 --> 23:57.299
You're welcome. Where do you live?

23:57.383 --> 24:00.302
I don't live far from here.
It's just around the corner.

24:00.386 --> 24:02.346
I can make it home all right.

24:02.513 --> 24:05.057
- Thank you, Wonder Woman.
- You're welcome.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.311
Lois.

24:28.914 --> 24:29.998
Nadia!

25:03.240 --> 25:05.951
Someone just tried
to break into my apartment.

25:06.785 --> 25:08.078
You sure it wasn't me?

25:08.161 --> 25:09.913
You don't believe me.

25:11.081 --> 25:12.499
Will you stop it?

25:13.083 --> 25:14.417
I do believe you.

25:14.501 --> 25:16.461
This is crazy. I'm going to call the cops.

25:16.545 --> 25:18.755
They must know by now.

25:18.839 --> 25:21.883
The IADC has sent an agent, Diana Prince.

25:22.133 --> 25:24.928
- Where is she now?
- I ran away from her.

25:25.220 --> 25:28.557
I was scared! Even she can't stop them!

25:29.641 --> 25:30.767
Come here.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.812
Stay with me. I'll take care of you.

25:52.038 --> 25:53.289
Nadia.

25:54.791 --> 25:55.875
Come on.

26:03.633 --> 26:04.717
Nadia!

26:18.147 --> 26:19.774
Come on, honey. Quick.

26:23.986 --> 26:26.239
Hurry. Come on.

26:27.657 --> 26:31.953
I don't know what's happening to me.
Those men keep trying to-

26:32.078 --> 26:35.581
Those men were simply
completing their assignment.

26:35.832 --> 26:36.999
At last.

26:44.966 --> 26:48.511
Welcome, Nadia Samara.

27:47.569 --> 27:49.655
Two hundred feet.

27:50.072 --> 27:53.075
You threw further than that
in high school, Bill.

27:53.825 --> 27:57.037
Perhaps you wish me
to send the Taggarts to Iowa...

27:57.246 --> 27:59.623
to see your mother, Bill.

28:00.666 --> 28:04.628
We could put her in a phone booth, Bill.

28:05.128 --> 28:08.215
Do you really think
I would compete for your country?

28:09.466 --> 28:11.301
Of course you will compete.

28:11.510 --> 28:13.095
Just like the rest.

28:13.804 --> 28:16.890
This lovely young couple behind you
will see to that.

28:19.726 --> 28:23.522
You see, they're champions
of quite another sort.

28:25.398 --> 28:27.609
Assassination.

28:28.652 --> 28:30.070
What do you mean?

28:30.153 --> 28:32.948
Murder is a skill, in a way.

28:33.281 --> 28:36.952
Depending, of course, on your point
of view. Wouldn't you say so, beloved?

28:37.035 --> 28:38.620
I've always said so, darling.

28:38.703 --> 28:41.289
Yes, you'll change your mind, Nadia.

28:42.290 --> 28:45.377
You see, several of your team members
have at first shown...

28:45.460 --> 28:47.879
a certain reluctance to compete.

28:47.962 --> 28:50.799
However, each of you has a clay pigeon...

28:51.466 --> 28:53.676
a loved one or two in your life.

28:53.802 --> 28:55.762
Mr. and Mrs. Taggart here...

28:56.304 --> 28:59.265
They are my skeet shooters.

29:02.727 --> 29:05.396
All my relatives are behind
the Iron Curtain.

29:05.563 --> 29:07.106
You can't hurt them!

29:08.983 --> 29:10.818
Then we just might have to settle...

29:10.902 --> 29:14.572
for someone in
the more immediate vicinity, mightn't we?

29:25.708 --> 29:26.834
Excuse me.

29:27.585 --> 29:30.588
They told me at the dorm
I'd find Tom Hamilton here.

29:31.422 --> 29:32.924
Some guys have all the luck.

29:33.007 --> 29:35.092
I just want to ask him about his girlfriend.

29:35.176 --> 29:38.638
How about asking me about my girlfriend?
She just left on a field trip.

29:38.721 --> 29:41.098
And I'm afraid I'm on a business trip.

29:43.851 --> 29:44.936
Hamilton!

29:45.353 --> 29:47.647
She wants to talk to you about Nadia.

29:50.066 --> 29:53.527
Hamilton. Now that's typical.

29:54.028 --> 29:56.614
He's been acting crazy lately.
Real whacko.

29:56.947 --> 29:59.283
When's the last time you saw him
with Nadia?

29:59.367 --> 30:02.078
A while back. I try to avoid both of them.

30:02.161 --> 30:04.663
Sometimes she acts crazier than he does.

30:04.872 --> 30:06.123
Okay, thanks.

30:06.749 --> 30:08.584
- You better be careful.
- Why?

30:08.667 --> 30:10.377
It might be contagious.

30:34.568 --> 30:35.736
Tom?

30:38.655 --> 30:41.075
I just want to ask you a few questions.

30:41.367 --> 30:44.286
Tom! I'm a friend of Nadia's.

31:19.321 --> 31:20.614
Tom, wait!

31:38.465 --> 31:39.549
Wonder Woman.

31:39.633 --> 31:41.718
I didn't know.
I thought you were that lady-

31:41.801 --> 31:45.680
I know. She's a friend. I'm a friend, too.
We're both looking for Nadia.

31:45.764 --> 31:48.224
- I still am.
- You don't know where she is?

31:48.308 --> 31:50.810
No. I'm scared.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.272
When was the last time you saw her?

31:54.356 --> 31:55.440
Last night.

31:55.523 --> 31:58.943
She came in here telling me someone
tried to break into her apartment.

31:59.027 --> 32:00.111
And she ran out.

32:00.195 --> 32:02.822
Something scared her in here.
I haven't seen her since.

32:02.906 --> 32:04.783
What's going on? I didn't call the cops...

32:04.866 --> 32:06.784
'cause I didn't want to make things worse.

32:06.868 --> 32:08.620
What kind of trouble is she in, anyway?

32:08.703 --> 32:10.872
We don't know. We're not sure yet.

32:10.955 --> 32:13.666
What can I do? I love that girl. I really do.

32:15.501 --> 32:18.171
You have to do
the hardest thing of all, Tom.

32:18.504 --> 32:19.589
Wait.

32:27.597 --> 32:28.681
Trevor.

32:29.182 --> 32:30.850
Diana, I've been trying to reach you.

32:30.933 --> 32:32.018
I was hoping you were.

32:32.101 --> 32:35.646
I caught up with Nadia's boyfriend
and he has no idea where she is.

32:35.730 --> 32:36.856
You got something?

32:36.939 --> 32:40.943
We've had agents checking the next of kin
of the athletes that have disappeared.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.612
But no missing person reports?

32:42.695 --> 32:43.821
Exactly.

32:43.905 --> 32:45.490
Because they're all scared to death.

32:45.573 --> 32:47.658
None of them will admit anything's wrong.

32:47.742 --> 32:50.286
Sons and daughters missing
and nobody will say a word.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.205
Someone's threatening them, right?

32:52.288 --> 32:54.332
That must be.
But we don't know who or why.

32:54.415 --> 32:56.667
You haven't exactly made my day.

32:56.751 --> 32:59.795
I'll be at Nadia's dormitory
if you come up with anything else.

32:59.879 --> 33:02.798
I get the feeling we're missing something
terribly obvious.

33:02.882 --> 33:04.216
Like Mariposa?

33:05.468 --> 33:07.053
Like Mariposa.

33:07.386 --> 33:08.679
Get back with me.

33:08.763 --> 33:09.889
All right.

33:26.739 --> 33:29.742
Something just occurred to us,
Your Excellency.

33:30.367 --> 33:31.577
Out with it.

33:34.038 --> 33:36.123
Something you mentioned earlier.

33:37.541 --> 33:41.503
That upon all your previous encounters
with Diana Prince...

33:41.754 --> 33:43.756
Wonder Woman has shown up.

33:44.757 --> 33:48.260
My old friend does seem to move
in fast company, doesn't she?

33:48.385 --> 33:50.429
And now in Nadia's apartment...

33:50.971 --> 33:52.222
Wonder Woman.

33:54.141 --> 33:55.726
And what occurred to you is that...

33:55.809 --> 34:00.022
Wonder Woman might make
a superb addition to my Olympics team.

34:00.105 --> 34:01.481
Right.

34:02.316 --> 34:05.444
And it occurred to you
that if Diana Prince arrived...

34:06.236 --> 34:08.405
Wonder Woman wouldn't be far behind.

34:08.487 --> 34:09.656
Right.

34:09.739 --> 34:12.618
But did it occur to you to devise a plan...

34:12.701 --> 34:15.786
to capture one of IADC's top operatives?

34:22.753 --> 34:23.920
Flowers.

34:25.964 --> 34:27.340
Flowers.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.849
Hello. Who is it?

34:36.016 --> 34:37.266
Delivery man.

34:38.643 --> 34:39.895
Diana Prince?

34:40.603 --> 34:43.648
Yes, but this isn't my apartment.
How did you know I was here?

34:43.732 --> 34:44.983
I just deliver them, ma'am.

34:45.065 --> 34:47.694
They were sent by wire
from Washington, D.C.

34:48.737 --> 34:51.281
They must be from Steve.
Hold on a second.

34:54.367 --> 34:56.494
- Here you go. Thank you.
- Thanks.

35:13.803 --> 35:18.141
Rarer than roses or mimosa,
a little gift from...

35:45.835 --> 35:49.464
Why, I thought you'd be pleased
to see a familiar face.

35:51.465 --> 35:53.593
Not yours, Mariposa.

35:53.926 --> 35:56.512
Did you enjoy the candy I sent you?

35:57.013 --> 35:58.347
Not in the least.

35:58.431 --> 36:01.392
I enjoyed the flowers even less.

36:02.101 --> 36:05.980
What's the matter?
Lost your sense of humor?

36:06.856 --> 36:09.150
I was hoping that I was rid of yours.

36:09.233 --> 36:10.359
Weren't you supposed...

36:10.443 --> 36:13.654
to have drowned in the North Sea
at the end of our last encounter?

36:13.738 --> 36:17.950
You should know that I always have
my entrances and my exits...

36:18.284 --> 36:20.369
carefully choreographed.

36:20.745 --> 36:24.206
Why, Diana, I had one of my submarines
pick me up.

36:29.545 --> 36:33.215
Since when was kidnapping
a part of your choreography?

36:34.258 --> 36:36.760
With your case...

36:36.844 --> 36:39.888
since I became interested
in capturing Wonder Woman.

36:42.850 --> 36:46.312
What do I have to do
with Wonder Woman?

36:46.729 --> 36:50.441
It's Wonder Woman's interest in you
that interests me.

37:01.910 --> 37:06.707
You see, I'm fielding what will prove to be
the greatest Olympic team in the world.

37:08.041 --> 37:10.919
These are some of the athletes
I've recruited.

37:13.088 --> 37:16.842
You will find that I treat them
like the thoroughbreds they are.

37:17.926 --> 37:22.431
Plenty of rest, fresh air,
sunshine, exercise.

37:22.973 --> 37:25.726
They eat only the finest health foods.

37:26.226 --> 37:29.938
No additives, no preservatives.

37:30.188 --> 37:34.276
Nothing but the best
for the Mariposalian Olympic team.

37:36.278 --> 37:39.156
That's very interesting,
but what does that have to do...

37:39.239 --> 37:41.366
with me or Wonder Woman?

37:42.784 --> 37:46.830
Isn't it obvious?
I want Wonder Woman on my team.

37:47.455 --> 37:52.043
And since she always shows up
whenever an IADC agent...

37:52.127 --> 37:55.130
particularly you, are threatened...

37:56.047 --> 38:00.719
I want you, as of this moment,
to consider yourself threatened.

38:02.012 --> 38:05.432
Lock her up! At once!

38:17.777 --> 38:19.571
You...

38:19.654 --> 38:22.490
You keep your mother's picture
in a wallet.

38:22.949 --> 38:27.412
From this moment on,
you may rest assured that the dear lady...

38:27.495 --> 38:30.582
is being viewed
from the very same angle...

38:30.665 --> 38:34.877
through the crosshairs
of a telescopic sight.

38:36.671 --> 38:39.632
And a rifle is trained on your father.

38:41.467 --> 38:45.763
Your brother! Your grandmother in Italy.

38:49.517 --> 38:51.519
Your boyfriend.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.772
Don't you touch him!

38:56.774 --> 38:59.735
I won't. No...

39:00.820 --> 39:05.366
but the Taggarts might.
You remember Mr. and Mrs. Taggart.

39:06.325 --> 39:10.371
- Lois and Bo? A lovely couple.
- No.

39:10.871 --> 39:12.623
No, please!

39:24.051 --> 39:26.554
Get rid of Tom Hamilton.

39:26.637 --> 39:29.557
It's time our guests learned
that I mean business.

39:34.228 --> 39:36.981
I said, "Get rid of him. "

39:37.064 --> 39:40.568
I just wanted to point out that
by getting rid of the people we have...

39:40.651 --> 39:44.572
under surveillance, your hold
on the athletes will be weakened.

39:45.197 --> 39:49.910
Nonsense.
Nobody ever runs out of loved ones.

39:50.995 --> 39:53.205
Your case may be an exception.

40:06.927 --> 40:08.345
What's happened?

40:08.679 --> 40:12.224
The Taggarts are gonna kill
Nadia's boyfriend.

40:12.516 --> 40:13.642
What?

40:13.725 --> 40:16.812
They just left. He was on the level.

40:17.396 --> 40:19.314
It could've been my mother.

40:25.779 --> 40:30.242
- I'm really not hungry right now.
- Okay.

42:34.740 --> 42:36.951
- Where's Nadia?
- She's fine.

42:37.034 --> 42:41.247
She's at the old Richardson estate.
Get the police and I'll meet you there.

42:43.207 --> 42:46.210
"This other Eden, demi-paradise

42:47.086 --> 42:50.214
"this fortress built by Nature for herself

42:50.297 --> 42:52.716
"Against infection and the hand of war

42:53.884 --> 42:56.345
"This happy breed of men

42:56.720 --> 42:59.223
"this little world

43:00.391 --> 43:04.311
"This precious stone set in a silver sea

43:04.978 --> 43:07.481
"Which serves it in the office of a wall

43:07.898 --> 43:11.193
"Or as a moat defensive to a house

43:11.401 --> 43:13.987
"Against the envy of unhappier lands

43:14.488 --> 43:17.324
"This blessed plot

43:17.407 --> 43:20.786
"this earth, this realm

43:21.370 --> 43:24.581
"this Mariposalia "

43:28.377 --> 43:30.420
My country, right or wrong.

43:31.380 --> 43:33.048
Mostly wrong.

43:33.256 --> 43:37.636
It's quite a dream, Mr. Mariposa.
But I'm afraid it's only a dream.

43:38.095 --> 43:41.556
I had more or less the same problem
with Napoleon Bonaparte.

43:42.265 --> 43:47.104
His dream was to conquer the world.
Mine is a little bit more realistic.

43:49.106 --> 43:51.733
You call this realistic?

43:51.817 --> 43:54.569
I'm beginning to lose my temper with you,
Mr. Mariposa...

43:54.653 --> 43:57.197
and it's something I haven't done
in 500 or 600 years.

43:57.280 --> 44:00.367
Then I would recommend
a little self-control.

44:01.201 --> 44:04.788
Many innocent people could suffer,
and will...

44:05.121 --> 44:09.084
- unless...
- Unless I join your Olympic team.

44:10.377 --> 44:14.881
Don't be so modest, Wonder Woman.
Join it, become it.

44:15.006 --> 44:17.342
Represent Mariposalia
at the next Olympic Games...

44:17.425 --> 44:20.095
and I will release all my prisoners.

44:20.637 --> 44:24.682
They and their loved ones
and Diana Prince...

44:24.933 --> 44:28.353
are in constant and immediate danger...

44:28.895 --> 44:31.689
thanks to my associates.

44:31.898 --> 44:33.942
Oh, the Taggarts.

44:35.068 --> 44:38.529
The Taggarts are in jail by this time,
and as for Eric...

44:38.613 --> 44:42.492
let's just say he's being detained.
The dream is over.

44:43.368 --> 44:45.828
Don't just stand there. Get her!

44:46.496 --> 44:48.289
Have a seat, ladies.

45:36.921 --> 45:38.547
It's finally over.

45:38.631 --> 45:41.050
Mariposa's gonna join the Taggarts
in jail shortly.

45:41.133 --> 45:43.010
All right!

45:43.344 --> 45:47.848
You're free to compete in the Olympics
for your countries and by your own choice.

45:52.019 --> 45:53.479
Let's do it!

46:21.256 --> 46:24.343
Guys, let's get rid of those cameras.

46:46.531 --> 46:49.034
- Is Diana safe?
- Yes, don't worry.

46:49.117 --> 46:51.787
- We'd like to invite her to a wedding.
- She'd like that.

46:51.870 --> 46:54.748
Many times,
Diana and I talked about my future.

46:54.831 --> 46:58.627
- Now is the beginning of it.
- It's all downhill from here, darling.

46:59.211 --> 47:00.754
Does that mean good?

47:01.505 --> 47:03.131
You bet it does.

47:03.924 --> 47:06.426
I'm going to teach you English.

47:06.509 --> 47:09.262
- On our honeymoon?
- Yes.

47:09.346 --> 47:12.057
- Can you come, too, Wonder Woman?
- Hey, wait a minute...

47:12.140 --> 47:14.309
I mean, to the wedding.

47:15.310 --> 47:17.228
I'll make sure Diana gets an invitation.

47:17.312 --> 47:19.981
One of us will be there.
You can count on it.

47:20.565 --> 47:21.941
Thank you.

47:32.619 --> 47:36.789
One thing we can say for Mariposa
is that he put together a heck of a team.

47:37.790 --> 47:40.835
Thanks to you Wonder Woman
we're back on the road again, right?

47:40.919 --> 47:42.295
Yeah!

47:43.087 --> 47:45.715
Where'd you learn
how to throw two javelins?

47:46.382 --> 47:47.675
You really wanna know?

47:47.759 --> 47:49.135
Yeah!

47:50.928 --> 47:53.264
It was something my mother taught me.

48:38.142 --> 48:39.226
English
