What? That's your heritage.

13:26.333 --> 13:28.166

-[Luna] <i>Abuelo!</i>
-[Memo, in Spanish] Are you okay?

59:22.958 --> 59:24.125
Can you get up?

59:36.875 --> 59:40.333
[in English] I'm so sorry, <i>abuelo.</i>
I didn't mean to push you.

59:40.416 --> 59:43.958
I don't know what got into me.
I'm really sorry.

59:45.416 --> 59:48.333
Hey, kids, come on.
We have to let him rest. <i>Vámonos.</i>

59:55.000 --> 59:56.125
You must be Alex.

59:57.291 --> 59:59.250
Chava told me about you.

59:59.333 --> 1:00:01.166
He was very excited you were coming.

1:00:01.250 --> 1:00:03.208
You, uh… You live in Cincinnati, right?

1:00:03.875 --> 1:00:05.916
-Kansas City.
-[exhales]

1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:09.208
You know, I went to school in Columbus.
It is very beautiful up there.

1:00:09.291 --> 1:00:11.000
Is <i>abuelo </i>gonna be all right?

1:00:11.083 --> 1:00:14.083
It's just a bump.
I gave him some medicine for the pain,

1:00:14.166 --> 1:00:15.750
but he was very disoriented.

1:00:18.291 --> 1:00:19.541
So how's his memory been?

1:00:19.625 --> 1:00:20.916
It's perfect.

1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:22.833
Well, he did go missing yesterday.

1:00:22.916 --> 1:00:27.041
He likes to get exercise,
he just went for a walk.

1:00:27.708 --> 1:00:29.458
You know, your <i>abuelo </i>is a strong man,

1:00:29.541 --> 1:00:31.291
but his condition is just gonna get worse.

1:00:31.375 --> 1:00:33.916
His farm is a lot for one man to care for.

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:35.416
He can do it.

1:00:38.375 --> 1:00:39.416
Let's hope so.

1:00:40.083 --> 1:00:41.708
[Chupa screeching]

1:00:43.458 --> 1:00:44.958
[in Spanish] What was that?

1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:48.833
[in English] It was a cow.

1:00:49.708 --> 1:00:51.583
That didn't sound like a cow.

1:00:52.875 --> 1:00:55.041
It was a sick cow.

1:00:55.125 --> 1:00:56.666
[Chupa screeching]

1:00:56.750 --> 1:00:59.333
A very sick cow. [chuckles nervously]

1:01:00.166 --> 1:01:01.458
He's okay.

1:01:01.541 --> 1:01:03.833
That's why I never wanted
to be a veterinarian.

1:01:03.916 --> 1:01:05.166
[in Spanish] Thank you so much.

1:01:05.250 --> 1:01:08.125

You need me, you call me.

1:01:10.375 --> 1:01:11.541
[Luna] Okay. <i>Gracias.</i>

1:01:23.916 --> 1:01:25.583
[screeching]

1:01:25.666 --> 1:01:28.250
No, no! Stop! Chupa!

1:01:28.333 --> 1:01:29.541
Stay back! It's dangerous.

1:01:29.625 --> 1:01:31.916
He's not dangerous! Please, put that down!

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.625
Get out of the way!
You don't know what you're dealing with!

1:01:34.708 --> 1:01:36.958

1:01:43.416 --> 1:01:45.750
[Quinn] There he goes.
He's gonna conk out.

1:01:45.833 --> 1:01:48.208
-Let it take effect. [shushing]
-[Alex] No!

1:01:48.291 --> 1:01:50.250
[sighs] Okay. Stay back!

1:01:51.291 --> 1:01:53.666
-<i>Lo mataste!</i>
-How could you?

1:01:53.750 --> 1:01:57.458
Relax. It's a mild sedative,
it's gonna be fine.

1:01:58.291 --> 1:02:01.000
Okay. I can't believe it.

1:02:02.083 --> 1:02:03.708

1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:26.666
[Luna] It's okay.
We're gonna get him back.

1:02:27.208 --> 1:02:28.291
[Quinn] Gotcha.
