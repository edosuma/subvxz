09:16.500 --> 09:18.000
- You do that,

09:18.041 --> 09:20.583
while I enjoy

09:18.041 --> 09:20.583
the semi-natural taste

09:20.625 --> 09:22.166
of Ragin' Red Rhubarb.

- Uh Ray...

09:46.834 --> 09:48.000
- Yeah what goes on?

09:49.959 --> 09:54.834
- Did you stuff Schwoz

09:49.959 --> 09:54.834
into a bucket of oats?

09:54.875 --> 09:58.041
- Nooo...I don't recall

09:54.875 --> 09:58.041
seeing Schwoz today.

- Schwoz! My schpoon

10:30.917 --> 10:34.792
is too schmall.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.917
- Well what I'm supposed

10:34.834 --> 10:36.917
to do about it?!

10:36.959 --> 10:39.542
- Go get your sister

10:36.959 --> 10:39.542
a bigger schpoon!

10:41.166 --> 10:42.875
- Ahhh, schvitz!

10:44.208 --> 10:46.959
- Why'd you stuff Schwoz

10:44.208 --> 10:46.959
in a bucket of oats?

10:47.041 --> 10:48.834
- 'Cuz! I'm the boss

10:47.041 --> 10:48.834
around here,

10:48.875 --> 10:50.625
and he was talking

10:48.875 --> 10:50.625
about blue chips

10:50.667 --> 10:51.750
and how great they are!

10:51.792 --> 10:53.041
- They are great!

10:53.083 --> 10:55.125
They're way better than

10:53.083 --> 10:55.125
those icky red chips!

- What are you talking about...

10:58.875 --> 11:01.375
- Oh c'mon you guys,

10:58.875 --> 11:01.375
this is so dumb.

11:01.417 --> 11:03.583
- Dumb?!?

11:01.417 --> 11:03.583
- How can you say that?

11:03.625 --> 11:05.875
- 'Cuz! No matter

11:03.625 --> 11:05.875
which chip wins,

11:05.917 --> 11:07.542
nothing's gonna change!

11:08.875 --> 11:10.208

11:08.875 --> 11:10.208
when they came out with

11:10.250 --> 11:11.959
nacho cheese flavored chips,

11:10.250 --> 11:11.959
and everyone thought

11:12.000 --> 11:13.875
they were gonna

11:12.000 --> 11:13.875
change the world?

11:13.917 --> 11:15.166
Well they didn't.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.542
And then they gave us

11:15.208 --> 11:17.542
sour cream and onion...

nothin' changed.

Hmmm?

16:04.417 --> 16:06.333
- Is there a Problem?

16:04.417 --> 16:06.333
- Well, sort of.

16:06.375 --> 16:07.959
Uh, when the truck was stolen,

16:06.375 --> 16:07.959
it was carrying

- So?

-Well, I guess you'll just

16:19.583 --> 16:22.834
have to ask the missing chips.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.417
- What does that mean?

16:23.875 --> 16:25.417
- Hmm?

16:25.458 --> 16:27.792
- Well, the chips are missing.

16:25.458 --> 16:27.792
So I can't ask the chips.

16:27.834 --> 16:30.083
- And even if he could,

16:27.834 --> 16:30.083
chips can't talk.

16:31.959 --> 16:34.583
- Well, if chips could talk

16:31.959 --> 16:34.583
and they were here,

16:34.625 --> 16:36.709
I'm sure they could tell us.

- Siii-scissors.

16:51.417 --> 16:53.959
Has anybody seen my scissors?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
My scissors?

16:55.041 --> 16:56.458
- No, I don't have them.

- Nooo.

16:58.792 --> 17:00.333
- We're the Man Fans.

17:00.375 --> 17:03.417
- The official fan club for

17:00.375 --> 17:03.417
Captain Man and Kid Danger.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.667
- We're verified.

17:04.709 --> 17:05.959
- Hey guys.

17:04.709 --> 17:05.959
- Yeah, sup Fans?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.875
- Okay! Are you kids

17:06.000 --> 17:07.875
here to see the launch

17:07.917 --> 17:09.291

17:09.333 --> 17:11.125
- No. Kids hate blimps.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.917
- We gotta decide

17:12.500 --> 17:14.917
which Frittle chip

17:14.959 --> 17:15.917
we're gonna vote for on Tuesday,

17:15.959 --> 17:17.375
so we need to know.

17:18.458 --> 17:19.500
- Need to know what?

17:19.542 --> 17:21.291
- Which chip Captain Man

17:19.542 --> 17:21.291
and Kid Danger

17:21.333 --> 17:22.500
are voting for!

17:24.083 --> 17:26.000
- We're gonna vote for whoever

17:24.083 --> 17:26.000
you guys tell us to.

17:26.041 --> 17:29.125
- Yeah, so.

17:26.041 --> 17:29.125
- Red or Blue?

17:29.166 --> 17:31.417
- Well...if you wanna know,

17:29.166 --> 17:31.417
personally I'm...

17:29.166 --> 17:31.417
- I'm gonna go

17:29.166 --> 17:31.417
with the...

17:35.458 --> 17:38.291
- You should not be getting

17:35.458 --> 17:38.291
involved in snack politics.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.417
- Uh, hey, look, sorry kids.

17:43.458 --> 17:46.417
But Captain Man and I do not get

17:43.458 --> 17:46.417
involved in snack politics,

17:46.458 --> 17:48.417
so you'll just have to--

17:46.458 --> 17:48.417
- Vote red!

17:48.458 --> 17:49.917
- What!

17:48.458 --> 17:49.917
- Yesss.

17:49.959 --> 17:51.750
- Kids! If you like me,

17:49.959 --> 17:51.750
Captain man says

17:51.792 --> 17:53.500
vote for the Ragin' Red

17:51.792 --> 17:53.500
Rhubarb Brittle!

17:53.542 --> 17:54.834
- Nooo! You're not supposed to--

17:54.875 --> 17:56.000
Vote blue!!!

17:56.041 --> 17:58.000
- Stop it!

17:56.041 --> 17:58.000
- You stop it!

17:58.041 --> 18:00.208
- Tell them to vote blue...

17:58.041 --> 18:00.208
- I can do whatever I want...

18:00.250 --> 18:02.375
Vote for the

18:00.250 --> 18:02.375
Ragin' Red Rhubarb Brittles or

18:00.250 --> 18:02.375
die!

18:02.417 --> 18:03.208
OK, you know what...

18:03.959 --> 18:05.291
Why don't you just take

18:03.959 --> 18:05.291
a walk and chill.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.208
- Oh yeah?

18:05.333 --> 18:06.208
- Yeah, chill.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.458
"C-H-I-L-L", chill, mm-kay?

18:08.709 --> 18:10.083
[Inaudible]

18:10.125 --> 18:12.041
Telling me what I can

18:10.125 --> 18:12.041
and cannot--

18:12.083 --> 18:14.583
[ gun powering on ]

18:14.625 --> 18:16.041
[ gun blast ]

18:20.542 --> 18:22.250
- Okay.

18:22.291 --> 18:24.792
- Okay, hey, look--just 'cuz

18:22.291 --> 18:24.792
I shot you in the face

18:24.834 --> 18:26.041
doesn't mean--

18:27.542 --> 18:28.375
- Ooh!

18:28.959 --> 18:29.750
- Like that?

18:29.875 --> 18:31.458
-Uhh, ok!

18:31.500 --> 18:33.250
- Uhhh...fellas...

18:33.291 --> 18:36.041
- No, no, he's asking for it.

18:33.291 --> 18:36.041
- Don't you do it.

18:37.792 --> 18:39.375
Ok...Now you've done it.

18:39.417 --> 18:43.750
Okay, say hello to

18:39.417 --> 18:43.750
my Frittle friend.

18:43.792 --> 18:45.291
Owwwww!

18:45.333 --> 18:47.917
Right in the eye, okay,

18:45.333 --> 18:47.917
that's how you wanna play

18:47.959 --> 18:49.000
- That's enough.

18:49.041 --> 18:50.583
- Oh, is it enough?

18:49.041 --> 18:50.583
- Yeah.

18:50.625 --> 18:52.083
- I'll just adjust this gauge...

19:14.500 --> 19:15.959
What's happening?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.959
- Why's that light flashing?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.041
- They jammed

19:18.000 --> 19:20.041
the system controls!

19:21.625 --> 19:23.208
Now the corn compressors

19:21.625 --> 19:23.208
are building up

19:23.250 --> 19:25.458
an extreme amount

19:23.250 --> 19:25.458
of pressure, and...

19:25.500 --> 19:28.000
and they can't release

19:25.500 --> 19:28.000
the corn gas!

19:30.458 --> 19:32.375
- Attention.

19:30.458 --> 19:32.375
This is Jack Frittleman.

19:32.417 --> 19:33.834
Run.

20:00.834 --> 20:03.834
And the explosion was felt

20:00.834 --> 20:03.834
all throughout Swellview,

20:03.875 --> 20:05.166
and even in some nearby cities,

20:05.208 --> 20:08.625
including Naborville,

20:05.208 --> 20:08.625
Border Town, and Rivalton.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.208
- But luckily, despite the

20:08.667 --> 20:11.208
magnitude of the blast,

20:11.250 --> 20:13.208
everyone important survived.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.166
- So, the real victim here

20:15.208 --> 20:16.959
is our own city of Swellview.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.792
Because not only has the red

20:17.000 --> 20:19.792
vs. blue contest been canceled,

20:19.834 --> 20:22.083
but also, C.E.O.

20:19.834 --> 20:22.083
Jack Frittleman says

20:22.125 --> 20:24.959
it's going to take four years

20:22.125 --> 20:24.959
to rebuild the factory.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.500
- Four years.

20:26.542 --> 20:29.041
That's a "Frittle" too long

20:26.542 --> 20:29.041
if you ask me.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.291
- I wish you'd been in

20:30.750 --> 20:32.291
that factory, Mary.

20:37.875 --> 20:38.917
- Dang it.

20:38.959 --> 20:41.000
I loved those blue

20:38.959 --> 20:41.000
Frittle chips.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.500
- I loved them too.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.208
- I loved the red ones.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.417
- I loved not caring.

20:47.875 --> 20:49.959
- Well, Henry and Schwoz...

20:50.000 --> 20:52.333
shucks for you guys.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.041
- What are you all happy about?

20:54.083 --> 20:57.083
- Oh y'know...

20:57.125 --> 20:59.333
Ragin' Red

20:57.125 --> 20:59.333
Rhubarb Frittles.

21:00.959 --> 21:04.291
- Well that's too bad,

21:00.959 --> 21:04.291
'cuz they all blew up.

21:05.667 --> 21:06.834
- Did they?

21:07.959 --> 21:10.917
- Uh yeah, it was just

21:07.959 --> 21:10.917
on the news.

21:10.959 --> 21:13.083
- Was it?

21:13.125 --> 21:15.417
- Yeah, we just watched it.

21:15.458 --> 21:17.208
- Did we?

21:17.250 --> 21:18.834
- Okay, will you

21:17.250 --> 21:18.834
quit doin' that?

21:18.875 --> 21:21.000
- Will I?

21:21.041 --> 21:22.125
- Ray, what do you know?

21:22.166 --> 21:24.083
- Well...I know...

21:24.125 --> 21:25.750
that when you're a superhero,

21:25.792 --> 21:28.000
and you find a stolen truck

21:25.792 --> 21:28.000
with four hundred cases

21:28.041 --> 21:29.917
of red Frittles inside,

21:29.959 --> 21:31.500
it's never a bad idea to

21:31.542 --> 21:33.834
snag a couple

21:31.542 --> 21:33.834
of cases for yourself.

21:34.917 --> 21:35.959
- But that's stealing.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.083
- Is it?

21:37.125 --> 21:38.583
- Yeah.

21:37.125 --> 21:38.583
- Pretty sure it is.

21:39.917 --> 21:40.917
- Yeah, all right.

21:40.959 --> 21:42.375
- W-w-wait...

21:42.417 --> 21:43.709
You're sayin' there's two cases

21:43.750 --> 21:45.125
of Frittles chips here?!?

21:45.166 --> 21:46.917
- Yep. About half a mile

21:45.166 --> 21:46.917
down there,

21:46.959 --> 21:49.625
right in the Man Cave.

21:49.667 --> 21:51.208
- Wait, wait...

21:51.250 --> 21:53.000
my sister Winnie went

21:51.250 --> 21:53.000
down to the Man Cave

21:53.041 --> 21:54.667
to have a schnack

21:53.041 --> 21:54.667
and take a nap.

21:55.792 --> 21:56.959
- You!

22:07.917 --> 22:09.917
[ oven bell ]

22:07.917 --> 22:09.917
- Mmm.
