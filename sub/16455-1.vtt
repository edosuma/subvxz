00:50.840 --> 00:53.844
Like to thank the Academy...

00:55.240 --> 00:58.210
and all its members...

01:03.280 --> 01:04.884
and thank the little people!

01:10.910 --> 01:12.480
Halt!

01:13.640 --> 01:17.167
Oh. No, no! Aah!

01:38.000 --> 01:39.640
Freeze!

01:45.840 --> 01:49.049
- Was that your mom?
- Dude, shut up.

02:05.640 --> 02:09.326
- Did I hit it? I think I hit it.
- I don't think it matters much...

02:09.520 --> 02:12.808
unless you've got
silver bullets in that thing.

02:13.280 --> 02:16.045
Also, you're right,
it did kind of look like my mom.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.729
A whole week in Atlantic City.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.043
This is gonna be the best vacation
since Pismo Beach.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.124
Didn't we get attacked
by a demon clam there?

04:50.720 --> 04:52.370
Okay, since Santa Fe.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.803
Where we were chased
by those radioactive cactus monsters.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.725
- Since Washington D.C.?
- Washington?

04:58.880 --> 05:01.565
Hmm, Washington? What happened there?

05:01.960 --> 05:04.406
Hmm. Lincoln Memorial.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.849
Oh, heh. Oh, yeah,
the Lincoln Memorial came to life...

05:08.000 --> 05:10.606
and tried to stomp on Scooby-Doo.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.698
- "Four score and:"
- Zoinks!

05:13.840 --> 05:18.323
Calm down, guys. This is Atlantic City.
The fun capital of the world.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.084
Nothing bad ever happens here.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.402
Well, gangland shootouts.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.211
Okay, yeah, obviously, gangland shootouts.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.931
But otherwise,
it's nothing but fun, fun, fun.

05:28.430 --> 05:31.114
Beaches and shows and...

05:31.600 --> 05:33.250
Wulfsmoon!

05:34.240 --> 05:36.322
My favorite band.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.446
Gang, we have to see them
while we're here.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.921
Their lead singer, Wulfric, is so awesome.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.648
He does that one song that goes:

05:48.000 --> 05:50.446
You think that's cool, check this out.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.364
A circus.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.448
Remember how I explained to you
what "cool" means?

05:57.600 --> 05:58.965
I love the circus.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.566
You know, I took that
circus-arts class last summer.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.290
We know.

06:03.440 --> 06:07.126
I really could have mastered the trapeze
if I hadn't broken all those bones.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.123
The trick is to not fall.

06:09.280 --> 06:12.329
That's great, Fred,
but, like, not everyone loves the...

06:12.480 --> 06:14.209
We gotta go see it tonight.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.045
- Really? I think we'd rather...
- My treat.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.202
- Maybe some other...
- I insist.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.928
- But we don't...
- I'm glad that's settled.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.367
You guys are gonna love it.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.143
Hooray, the circus.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.641
Well, they don't open till tomorrow night.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.564
- Let's get going.
- Hang on.

06:37.720 --> 06:42.009
- I wanna see if there's anyone here.
- Wait, no. Like, they're closed.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.640
I am not going into a dark circus.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.487
Hey, the door's open.
Let's just have a little look around.

06:59.640 --> 07:03.326
Okay, I am not staying in a dark circus.

07:04.160 --> 07:08.006
Look at this place.
Even the stuffed animals are scary.

07:08.160 --> 07:12.609
Especially that. What is that, a clown?
Come on, guys.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.367
On the creepy scale this place ranks
higher than a graveyard.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.409
An old graveyard.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.042
Higher than an old graveyard
in a swamp. On fire.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.488
Hello? Anybody here?

07:34.720 --> 07:35.721
Scoob...

07:35.880 --> 07:39.885
like, I have a really bad feeling about...

07:45.520 --> 07:47.204
Phew.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.727
Run, Scoob!

08:00.600 --> 08:01.840
What are you doing here?

08:02.040 --> 08:04.168
I'm sorry. But the door was open
and we just...

08:04.320 --> 08:07.209
Open? But I'm sure I locked...

08:10.560 --> 08:11.766
He is here.

08:12.520 --> 08:15.410
- Come. We should stick together.
- But what...

08:15.560 --> 08:16.891
Come.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.882
- He will not elude me this time.
- Who?

08:22.040 --> 08:23.610
The werewolf.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.603
- The werewolf?
- The werewolf?

08:25.760 --> 08:29.082
Yes. I think he is this way.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.527
- Let's get out of here, Scoob.
- Okay.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.964
Hey, it's a baboon.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.445
Hmm.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.125
Ah.

09:10.440 --> 09:11.930
Let me try.

09:24.400 --> 09:29.627
Sorry, baboon dude.
I didn't mean to scare you.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.846
You again? It's just that...

09:42.320 --> 09:44.766
Werewolf!

09:52.120 --> 09:54.600
- There's nothing there.
- Yeah, guys, there's nothing...

09:54.760 --> 09:59.607
- Nothing? Oh, heh. That's a relief.
- Yeah.

10:01.720 --> 10:05.361
If it was right behind us,
you'd say something, right?

10:05.520 --> 10:06.851
I don't wanna look.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.531
I looked.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.123
This way.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.521
Down here.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.550
Slow down, Scoob.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.967
- Like, I think we lost him.
- I think we lost everyone, Shaggy.

10:33.200 --> 10:37.649
All I know is I don't wanna see
anything big and hairy.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.646
Especially that, eh, Scoob?

10:46.480 --> 10:48.881
- Let's see if we can find that werewolf.
- Find it?

10:49.080 --> 10:50.366
I wanna run away from it...

10:50.520 --> 10:53.171
- ...like a terrified school girl.
- Yeah.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.402
Let's find it
so you'll know which way to run.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.928
But... You know, that kind of makes sense.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.084
This place sure is empty.

11:09.400 --> 11:13.246
Ah! Just a... thingy.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.841
You know, Scoob, I think it went away.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.247
Velma.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.087
Velma.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.765
Quiet.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.281
I can handle it.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.765
Back.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.241
- That's vampires.
- What?

11:49.400 --> 11:52.449
- Garlic. That's for vampires.
- Are you sure?

11:53.760 --> 11:55.285
Because I really think...

11:57.200 --> 11:58.406
Pretty sure.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.483
I thought a little light might help.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.561
It's gone for now.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.167
Thank you.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.529
I am Marius Brancusi,
owner of this circus.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.011
How can I repay you?

12:35.000 --> 12:38.846
Maybe first you should explain to us
what's going on here.

12:40.440 --> 12:43.523
I inherited this circus
from my uncle last year...

12:43.680 --> 12:46.001
and I've been working to modernize it.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.010
I've been making it more stylish...

12:49.200 --> 12:55.048
phasing out the animal acts,
giving it more of a theatrical flair.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.729
Also I cleaned the toilets,
which has been a huge improvement.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.366
All this has led to our latest show:

13:03.520 --> 13:05.363
"Celestia."

13:05.520 --> 13:09.366
This is so fantastic.
Did I mention I love the circus?

13:09.520 --> 13:12.126
Uh, several times, yes.

13:12.280 --> 13:15.363
- But what about the werewolf?
- It's terrible.

13:15.560 --> 13:19.451
I thought tonight, while all my employees
are having a night on the town...

13:19.600 --> 13:22.046
I might find some clues about the beast.

13:22.200 --> 13:26.250
I'm certain the werewolf must be someone
who's part of the circus.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.051
You mean, in disguise?

13:29.240 --> 13:32.323
Perhaps it is not a disguise.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.688
You understand that I'm saying
it might be a real werewolf, right?

13:37.840 --> 13:41.242
- Yeah.
- It's just that I expected a bigger reaction.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.927
I was being so dramatic
and did I show you my pectoral muscles?

13:45.080 --> 13:46.241
Moving on.

13:47.440 --> 13:52.480
All right. For the last few months,
the creature has plagued us wherever we go.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.921
It has scared off many of my artists.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.243
And in every city we visit,
it has stolen jewelry.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.568
- Jewelry?
- Jewelry.

14:00.720 --> 14:04.327
And I thought my accent was thick.
Anyway, it's very strange.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.767
Why would a werewolf want jewels?

14:06.920 --> 14:09.810
Like, maybe he's a lady werewolf.

14:11.440 --> 14:18.130
Because, um, you know,
girls like pretty things to have.

14:18.280 --> 14:19.566
It was just a thought.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.963
I think I remember a case like this
in 18th century Bavaria.

14:23.120 --> 14:27.011
- May I use your computer?
- Of course.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.764
Bavaria, werewolf.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.246
Oh, here it is. It was in Ingolstadt.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.007
A werewolf known as "Hans"
collected certain gemstones...

14:39.160 --> 14:42.130
and used them to increase his power.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.124
Normally, a werewolf only becomes
a wolf at the full moon.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.561
But with the right combination of jewels...

14:47.720 --> 14:50.963
Hans was able to change
from man to wolf at any time.

14:51.160 --> 14:54.960
He and the werewolves he created
terrorized Ingolstadt for decades.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.367
- Created?
- Yes.

14:57.520 --> 15:01.684
Anyone who is bitten by a werewolf
and lives turns into a werewolf.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.049
Apparently, the Ingolstadt werewolves
claimed hundreds of victims...

15:05.200 --> 15:08.090
before being driven out by Maximilian III.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.005
Wow, you guys are lucky
you didn't get bitten.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.485
Yeah, like, we...

15:16.440 --> 15:18.966
Everybody get back.
He's turning into a werewolf.

15:26.880 --> 15:31.090
Some friends. I need the Heimlich
and you're reaching for the silver bullets.

15:31.280 --> 15:34.011
You get that?
Silver bullets for werewolves...

15:34.200 --> 15:37.283
garlic for vampires,
the Heimlich for Shaggy.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.204
Who are you people?

15:39.360 --> 15:41.442
How do you know so much about werewolves?

15:41.600 --> 15:43.967
We solve mysteries. It's kind of a hobby.

15:44.120 --> 15:49.160
A hobby? Stamp collecting is a hobby.
Solving mysteries is... Wait.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.290
Maybe you could help me
investigate this werewolf.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.011
Yes. And we could pose
as circus performers.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.650
Sure, why not?

15:57.080 --> 15:59.447
Of course, it will be very dangerous.

15:59.640 --> 16:03.725
- And there's the "Why not." See you.
- We have to do it, Shaggy.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.201
- For the good of the circus.
- Forget it.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.811
For the safety of the public.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.485
No way.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.881
For all the cotton candy you can eat?

16:12.040 --> 16:16.045
Count me out. Hey, and, uh, churros too?

16:16.240 --> 16:20.086
- And churros.
- Like, dude, heh, I'm in.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.641
Yeah, me too. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.168
Well, if you're going to pass
for circus artists...

16:26.320 --> 16:28.846
it's going to take a little work.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.046
So do any of you have circus skills?

16:41.200 --> 16:43.407
I took a circus-arts class last summer.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.888
Why am I not surprised?
And what did you learn?

16:47.040 --> 16:51.921
I worked out on the trapeze a bit, but, uh,
I ended up breaking a lot of bones.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.605
You seem to have healed well.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.764
What? Oh, not my bones.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.242
I was supposed to catch this guy
and, uh, I dropped him.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.609
Onto someone. And they both
fell into some other people.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.127
- That's terr...
- Who hit the tent support...

17:06.280 --> 17:10.079
which tipped the popcorn cart,
which set fire to the audience risers...

17:10.240 --> 17:13.243
which collapsed with 48 people
sitting on them.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.040
- Well, I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
- No, it was.

17:17.839 --> 17:20.650
But I did learn a valuable lesson
about the trapeze.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.801
- Which was?
- Don't drop people.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.531
Oh, and don't fall.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.569
Yes, those are kind of the basics.

17:29.600 --> 17:35.004
How would you like a junior,
second-assistant, backup trapeze position?

17:35.160 --> 17:38.767
- It would be an honor, sir.
- You are a strange fellow.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.410
But I admire your neckwear.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.325
Anyone else have any talents
that might apply?

17:43.480 --> 17:46.211
When I was a kid
I used to do a little motorcycle act.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.489
Really? It takes years of practice to...

17:49.640 --> 17:51.404
It went like this.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.648
Right, that'll do.

18:09.240 --> 18:13.689
I've phased animal acts out of my circus,
but I could make an exception.

18:13.840 --> 18:18.448
- Your friend here seems very well-trained.
- Oh, he is.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.364
Shake.

18:21.240 --> 18:28.124
- Beg.
- Like, please, please, please.

18:28.280 --> 18:30.681
Good boy.

18:31.560 --> 18:36.009
Uh, just for the sake of tradition,
maybe you should do the tricks.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.367
That's probably a good idea...

18:38.520 --> 18:41.091
because Scooby-Doo
does more circus-y stuff than me.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.969
Show him, Scoob.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.486
Ta-da.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.244
You taught him all this?

19:02.400 --> 19:05.370
He tried, but, like, I just can't get it.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.127
- Poor baby.
- And...

19:11.080 --> 19:13.401
- Hello?
- Hi.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.484
If you're afraid,
I could put you on the churro cart.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.769
- No, no. I can do it.
- Do what?

19:19.920 --> 19:21.684
I don't know. Something.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.683
There are still a few acts I could use.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.446
- How about knife-throwing?
- No.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.086
- Sword-swallowing?
- No.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.447
- Fire-eating?
- No.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.764
Hmm. The only thing that's left
is the human comet.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.367
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- You get shot out of a cannon.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.922
Can we go back to the knife-throwing?

19:44.800 --> 19:46.450
I have to get everyone prepared.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.922
- Meet me back here in the morning.
- Check. What time?

19:50.120 --> 19:51.281
Five o'clock.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.603
There's no 5:00 in the morning.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.649
Is there?

20:00.840 --> 20:03.446
I have a bad feeling about this.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.929
I wonder if we should use code names
while we're undercover.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.320
VELMA, DAPHNE & SCOOBY: No.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.164
I could be Dominic St. Chinard...

20:29.320 --> 20:32.085
ne'er-do-well son of a New England
shipping magnate who...

20:32.240 --> 20:33.571
VELMA, DAPHNE & SCOOBY: No.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.643
Finally, you're here. Come on.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.167
You have to meet
your fellow circus artistes.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.367
Yay!

20:39.520 --> 20:42.285
Any one of whom could be
a bloodthirsty monster.

20:42.440 --> 20:43.930
Boo.

20:44.440 --> 20:48.411
Whitney Doubleday.
He's our animal trainer.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.522
- Hello?
- Yes?

20:57.920 --> 20:59.365
Like, what happened, Scoob?

20:59.520 --> 21:02.126
Oh, terribly sorry.
Thirty minutes every day.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.765
Marvelous for the lower back.

21:03.920 --> 21:07.049
Whitney Doubleday, animal trainer.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.402
Good boy.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.691
Whitney Doubleday, animal trainer.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.047
Good boy.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.526
Sorry, after 40 years
of handing out treats...

21:22.680 --> 21:23.966
it's become a habit.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.201
Oh, thanks.

21:27.360 --> 21:31.410
Uh, Shaggy Rogers,
I'm also an animal train...

21:31.600 --> 21:36.208
- Um, I guess I'm more of an animal partner.
- Yeah. Partners.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.727
Well, I suppose if you're a team,
that's different.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.962
I thought it was odd
that Marius hired you.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.203
You see, he eliminated
all the trained animals from the circus.

21:44.400 --> 21:49.486
Really? Huh. Well, you must be angry
and embittered and seeking revenge.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.083
Ha, ha. Not at all. I was retiring anyway.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.766
The public doesn't want
trained animals anymore.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.730
Too many stories
about abusive training techniques.

21:58.920 --> 22:02.641
Of course, I never hurt
any of my animals. Right, Leoni?

22:05.400 --> 22:07.562
But there are a few bad apples out there.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.609
No, I'm afraid my kind of act
is a thing of the past.

22:12.080 --> 22:16.210
Hey, um, have you ever trained,
I don't know...

22:16.360 --> 22:21.366
for instance, just off the top
of my head, um, wolves?

22:21.520 --> 22:24.444
Wolves? No, no one works with wolves.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.090
They're too unpredictable.

22:26.280 --> 22:29.011
I'd have better luck
trying to train a hurricane.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.363
So if you're not in the show,
why are you and your animals here?

22:32.520 --> 22:34.602
Well, we're just along for the ride.

22:34.760 --> 22:38.606
I'm transporting them to a sanctuary
in California that's agreed to take them.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.127
I think I'll miss my baboons the most.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.681
So much like people, don't you think?

22:44.680 --> 22:46.648
Huh? Oh.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.727
I don't really see any resemblance.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.327
Huh?

23:10.480 --> 23:12.289
I always use Spanish commands.

23:12.440 --> 23:17.082
The animals are less likely to hear shouts
from the audience and get confused.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.369
Wow, Scoob.

23:22.520 --> 23:26.149
- You think we could do something like that?
- Sure.

23:33.080 --> 23:36.482
Well, it's unusual, I'll give them that.

23:41.520 --> 23:44.683
Velma, meet Archambault, our strongman.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.922
You'll be working with him.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.127
Uh...

23:48.320 --> 23:52.803
Don't be afraid,
big hairy man is not werewolf.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.440
You heard about werewolf?

23:55.600 --> 23:57.364
Terrible, terrible.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.444
Very bad for circus, oui?

24:00.600 --> 24:03.490
- Okay.
- Um, what are you...

24:03.640 --> 24:07.929
Ah. Archambault forget,
you are new to the circus.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.526
Please, you should step on the hand.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.729
- What?
- Step on the hand.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.360
Trust Archambault.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.521
Whoa!

24:17.720 --> 24:21.167
Archambault is not fake
like some strongmans, eh?

24:21.320 --> 24:27.566
Archambault is genuine article.
Strongest man in Quebec, eh?

24:28.560 --> 24:30.403
- But why...
- Is part of act.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.164
I carry you to cannon.

24:32.360 --> 24:36.684
Then you climb in, I pull lever,
boom, boom, land in net, oui?

24:36.840 --> 24:41.368
- Um, I guess.
- Good. We do some practicing.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.587
Make sure you shouldn't break head.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.680
Human comet, fire!

24:54.840 --> 24:55.887
Sorry.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.361
I think I tensed up.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.370
There.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.562
Those are the people
I'll be performing with?

25:07.720 --> 25:10.929
Not performing. You're junior,
second-assistant, backup trapeze.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.730
That means you stand by the net.

25:12.880 --> 25:16.009
- And do what?
- As little as possible.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.407
If someone falls,
you help them out of the net.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.086
Oliverio. Lena. This is Fred.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.681
Oliverio is very jealous,
so don't look at Lena.

25:25.840 --> 25:29.447
But don't look like you're not looking
at her, because that makes her flirty.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.601
Wait, what?

25:31.080 --> 25:33.242
Ah, the new net boy.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.766
- Something is wrong with your neck?
- No, um...

25:41.920 --> 25:45.163
Maybe his cute little scarf is too tight.

25:45.320 --> 25:49.803
Come by my trailer later
and I loosen it for you, yeah?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.446
Listen to me, net boy.
You stay away from Lena...

25:54.600 --> 25:56.648
or I pop your head off like a bottle cap.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.806
Nice to meet you. I'm Fred.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.610
You'll be with the clowns.

26:05.240 --> 26:08.483
- Ooh, clowns are fun.
- Fun like a root canal.

26:08.640 --> 26:09.641
What?

26:10.240 --> 26:11.287
In there.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.724
Gotta go.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.481
Um, hello?

26:22.680 --> 26:26.571
This is easy for you to say. "Hello."
North Americans...

26:26.720 --> 26:31.248
always so cheerful. "Hello."
Well, maybe I don't feel like hello.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.569
- Are you one of the clowns?
- No. I am an actor.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.291
I have merely undertaken
the role of a clown.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.284
That is a clown.

26:41.880 --> 26:44.167
No. You do not laugh at this honky-horn.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.687
It is low comedy, undignified.

26:46.840 --> 26:52.449
- I'm Daphne Blake.
- Yes, yes, the motorcycle girl. Marius said.

26:52.600 --> 26:56.047
- The buffoon here is Sisko.
- Pleased to meet you.

26:57.680 --> 27:02.720
- And I am Schmatko.
- Ha-ha-ha. Schmatko.

27:02.880 --> 27:06.089
- What a great clown name.
- It is not a clown name.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.811
I am Svyatopolk Stanislavevich Schmatko.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.566
Sisko, that is a clown name.

27:11.720 --> 27:15.042
Schmatko is a name of great dignity.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.727
Once I toured the Soviet Union
performing the classics.

27:18.880 --> 27:23.044
- Chekov. Pushkin. Turgenev.
- Bulgakov?

27:23.240 --> 27:27.962
You know Bulgakov?
At last, a person of culture.

27:28.160 --> 27:32.006
Sisko, we must show this cultured lady
our new routine.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.889
Sisko.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.085
And begin.

27:48.080 --> 27:50.082
So? What you think, eh?

27:51.880 --> 27:54.247
The umbrella represents intolerance.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.091
Sure, I got that.

27:57.240 --> 28:03.407
- Is funny, yes?
- Yeah, ha, ha, funny.

28:03.560 --> 28:06.530
I like this motorcycle girl.

28:06.680 --> 28:11.049
Okay. I go to make smoothie.
Who wants smoothie?

28:11.200 --> 28:15.091
- One strawberry. Motorcycle girl?
- Oh, no thanks.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.289
Fine, suture yourself. Back in a littles.

28:35.800 --> 28:38.610
So the circus is a little different
than I'd always imagined.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.808
- How so?
- It's full of crazy people.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.327
Oliverio threatened to pop my head off.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.608
I don't know
if your werewolf is real or not...

28:45.760 --> 28:49.128
but if you're looking for someone
with a grudge against the circus...

28:49.280 --> 28:50.725
there are plenty of suspects.

28:50.880 --> 28:53.611
Schmatko has a lot of bitterness
about being a clown.

28:53.760 --> 28:57.003
Archambault seems nice,
but he sure looks like a werewolf.

28:57.160 --> 29:00.243
Like, that Doubleday guy says
he doesn't mind losing his job...

29:00.400 --> 29:02.801
- ...but I don't know.
- I know, I know.

29:02.960 --> 29:06.806
- And there's one more suspect.
- Wulfsmoon?

29:06.960 --> 29:08.007
No way.

29:08.160 --> 29:12.006
They've been performing in every town
where the werewolf has appeared.

29:12.160 --> 29:15.881
Oh, so you're gonna blame them.
Just because they were there...

29:16.040 --> 29:18.327
and the lead singer
claims to be a werewolf.

29:18.520 --> 29:21.000
- What?
- You couldn't have mentioned this earlier?

29:21.160 --> 29:26.485
But it's just for publicity. I mean, heh,
he also says he's from Sweden.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.450
- And he isn't?
- Duh. Of course not.

29:29.600 --> 29:33.764
Sweden's just a made-up place,
like fairyland or Australia.

29:33.920 --> 29:37.168
I bet you think kangaroos are real too.

29:37.320 --> 29:41.370
- Shaggy.
- Sweden. Ha, ha. Duh.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.265
Kangaroos.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.887
Has he been kicked
in the head or something?

29:47.040 --> 29:48.041
Not yet.

29:48.200 --> 29:51.921
Like, all this speculationing
is making me hungry, Scoob.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.844
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.721
Guys, we are heading
for the legendary Cap'n Fatty's Rib Ranch...

29:57.880 --> 30:00.531
home of the
more-than-all-you-can-eat special.

30:00.680 --> 30:03.126
You eat as much as you can,
then they force dessert...

30:03.320 --> 30:06.244
- ...down your throat with a spatula.
- My kind of place.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.243
Anyone care to join us?

30:08.400 --> 30:10.243
We'll catch up with you.

30:10.400 --> 30:14.450
- Okay, bye.
- Just be back in time for the show.

30:17.360 --> 30:20.921
I mean, seriously. Like by a mule, kicked?

30:22.760 --> 30:26.810
After this, Scoob, we will have visited
almost all of the greatest rib joints...

30:26.960 --> 30:29.088
- ...in America.
- Yeah.

30:29.240 --> 30:33.245
All that's left is that one where the ribs
come with a coupon for free heart surgery.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.085
- What's it called?
- The rib reaper.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.402
Yeah, the rib reaper.

30:38.600 --> 30:42.010
Someday, Scooby-Doo. Some...

30:47.400 --> 30:52.566
Okay, when I say run, I want you to...

30:53.120 --> 30:55.726
I didn't say it. Aah!

30:58.240 --> 30:59.651
Huh?

31:28.120 --> 31:30.726
Like, how did it get in there so fast?

31:30.880 --> 31:32.245
I don't know.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.162
Shaggy and Scooby.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.161
What's going on?

31:44.320 --> 31:46.004
Guys, I think we hit something.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.641
Werewolf!

31:54.240 --> 31:55.287
There's two.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.047
- And that one, I think it's Schmatko.
- I beg your pardon?

31:59.200 --> 32:00.964
Schmatko, the clown.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.804
I recognize his costume.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.850
Schmatko, it's me. Motorcycle girl.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.685
He doesn't sound very friendly.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.322
Actually he wasn't all that friendly
even before he turned into a werewolf.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.370
- This way.
- No, this way.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.923
Uh-oh.

32:43.800 --> 32:47.168
They're after the girls.
We gotta do something.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.482
It's time to take out the trash.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.243
Dang. They're fast.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.241
What's that?

33:22.400 --> 33:26.121
I'm gonna guess it's Daphne and Velma
pounding on the manhole cover...

33:26.280 --> 33:28.760
you just buried under a ton of garbage.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.526
- Get us out of here.
- We're in the sewer.

33:34.400 --> 33:38.041
Well, guess we better start digging.

33:39.880 --> 33:44.090
Oh, this is worse than when the sword
swallower go the hiccups.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.465
Did he leave a note?

33:47.060 --> 33:49.922
What about on the fridge?
Did you look on the fridge?

33:50.060 --> 33:53.445
Of course I don't think you're stupid, I...

33:54.760 --> 33:56.410
Don't you think I know that?

33:57.560 --> 33:59.130
Thank goodness you're here.

33:59.280 --> 34:03.569
Schmatko's missing.
Sisko hasn't seen him since 6 a.m.

34:03.720 --> 34:04.767
Six-thirty.

34:04.920 --> 34:07.048
- He's a werewolf.
- What?

34:07.200 --> 34:11.649
We just got chased by two werewolves,
and one was wearing Schmatko's clothes.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.483
They broke into the museum
and stole an emerald necklace.

34:16.639 --> 34:20.360
He's collecting jewels.
And he's making more werewolves.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.568
It's just like in Ingolstadt.

34:25.560 --> 34:29.087
I know this is bad, but we've got a show
to do in half an hour.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.123
Nothing is impossible.

34:32.280 --> 34:35.568
- Daphne, you'll stand in for Schmatko.
- I'm doing what now?

34:35.760 --> 34:39.560
We'll need to fill some time.
Fred, can you walk a tight rope?

34:39.760 --> 34:41.569
Of course, I maybe can.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.964
Archambault can do cowboy routine.

34:46.120 --> 34:50.489
- Not the cowboy routine.
- Why you no like cowboy routine?

34:50.639 --> 34:56.522
Is best superb. I can make it
space cowboy for this "Celestia" thing.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.201
Fine, do it.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.010
With that we should be okay.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.202
As long as Shaggy and Scooby go over well.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.688
Come on, everyone get into costume.
It's showtime, folks.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.286
What's that smell?

35:14.440 --> 35:18.889
- We were in the sewer.
- And we were digging through garbage.

35:20.440 --> 35:24.331
You Americans really know how to party.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.646
- Everyone ready?
- No.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.882
Great. I'm going to start the show.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.324
Ladies and gentlemen.

35:44.480 --> 35:48.121
With the finest talent
from five continents...

35:48.280 --> 35:54.561
the Brancusi Circus presents, "Celestia."

37:56.720 --> 37:58.643
Whoa.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.648
Do it again. They love it.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.619
Heh. I fell.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.401
Nice working with you.

38:27.040 --> 38:32.251
Yippee-ki-yay, I am the space cowboy, oui?

38:32.400 --> 38:38.158
But in Quebec,
cowboy don't do things the easy way.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.924
Is best superb, oui?

39:07.800 --> 39:11.009
You see what I mean?
It makes people uncomfortable.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.362
Totally.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.761
Ladies and gentlemen...

39:15.920 --> 39:21.404
may I present Scooby and Shaggy?

39:22.000 --> 39:26.801
Hello, Atlantic City.
I give you Scooby-Doo.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.010
Ooh.

40:07.840 --> 40:08.966
Ta-da.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.848
Thank you, thank you.

40:18.480 --> 40:24.283
Oh, I'm Shaggy, his, uh, trainer.

40:24.480 --> 40:28.610
Shaggy! Shaggy! Shaggy!

40:28.760 --> 40:31.286
But what about me?

40:31.440 --> 40:34.330
Shaggy! Shaggy! Shaggy!

40:35.320 --> 40:36.685
That went well.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.330
You're up, human comet.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.369
I can't do this.

40:51.040 --> 40:55.204
- Don't worry. You are going to be fine.
- You think so?

40:56.200 --> 40:57.884
Eh, fifty-fifty.

40:59.160 --> 41:01.791
Aah! Werewolves.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.564
Well, that's a relief.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.730
Those costumes are awesome.

41:49.920 --> 41:53.083
Like, don't bite us.
I don't wanna be a werewolf.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.729
And I'm already a dog.

42:19.280 --> 42:22.568
Get away, shoo. Go chase a cat.

42:31.080 --> 42:32.570
Huh?

42:35.280 --> 42:37.487
There has to be something we can do.

42:37.640 --> 42:38.880
Usually I drop a net on...

42:41.320 --> 42:43.402
Ooh, that's a big net.

42:47.120 --> 42:50.806
No bitey. I am not a chew toy.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.520
Scooby!

43:42.760 --> 43:45.366
Shaggy. Scooby. Lead them over this way.

43:45.520 --> 43:47.010
Like, I'll try.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.244
- Now!
- Unh!

44:15.320 --> 44:17.909
- Got them.
- Come on.

44:31.240 --> 44:32.765
They have to be here.

44:33.960 --> 44:35.166
Apparently not.

44:35.320 --> 44:37.448
Very strange.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.762
How could they just disappear like that?

44:44.200 --> 44:46.931
Maybe, but where would they hide
the forklift?

44:48.320 --> 44:51.130
Why did they attack?
They weren't stealing jewels.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.123
They went right for Shaggy and Scooby.

44:53.280 --> 44:56.921
- You think they were trying to scare us off?
- It could be.

44:57.080 --> 45:02.644
How do you, like, stop this thing?

45:07.720 --> 45:09.643
That's one way.

45:13.320 --> 45:16.403
Everybody out. Follow the ushers.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.050
- Werewolves. What a great idea.
- Hilarious.

45:41.640 --> 45:44.325
- Unbelievable.
- What's that?

45:44.480 --> 45:45.925
Is it the werewolves?

45:46.080 --> 45:48.242
No, I don't think so.

45:48.400 --> 45:50.846
There were critics in the audience
last night.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.843
There are circus critics?

45:53.000 --> 45:56.129
These are the most incredible reviews
I've ever seen.

45:56.280 --> 45:59.250
They all assumed the werewolves
were part of the show.

45:59.440 --> 46:00.521
And look at this:

46:00.680 --> 46:05.083
They're calling Shaggy
the greatest circus artist since Felix Adler.

46:05.280 --> 46:08.011
- What?
- I'm so excited.

46:08.200 --> 46:12.922
And I would be so much more excited
if I had any idea who Felix Adler was.

46:13.120 --> 46:14.645
That's great, Shaggy.

46:14.800 --> 46:16.962
- Congratulations.
- Way to go.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.887
What about me?

46:20.040 --> 46:22.725
Listen. "The performance
young Shaggy Rogers...

46:22.920 --> 46:26.322
gets from his trained dog, Scabby..."
- Scabby?

46:26.480 --> 46:32.010
"is so remarkable, one might almost
believe the animal has a mind of its own."

46:32.160 --> 46:33.446
I do.

46:33.640 --> 46:37.361
- It's true, he does.
- Yeah, that was a little harsh.

46:37.560 --> 46:41.963
This is fantastic. Excuse me,
I have to show these around.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.407
Looks like we're a hit, huh?

46:44.560 --> 46:47.040
- "Scabby."
- You have heard?

46:47.240 --> 46:52.280
The newses are loving the show.
We sell many tickets now, eh?

46:52.440 --> 46:55.284
You all be sure
to come to breakfast today, okay?

46:55.440 --> 46:59.365
Archambault is going to make
his famous crepes. Aha.

46:59.520 --> 47:03.206
Kitchen trailer key.
Breakfast be ready soon.

47:05.600 --> 47:07.648
- What...
- Excusez-moi...

47:07.840 --> 47:11.242
- ...Archambault put it back on shelf.
- Wait a second.

47:11.400 --> 47:13.926
This is a book about
the Ingolstadt werewolves.

47:14.080 --> 47:16.651
But I thought Marius
had never heard about them.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.404
That's what he said.

47:18.600 --> 47:21.524
Like, maybe he just bought
that book yesterday?

47:21.680 --> 47:24.604
It was printed in Estonia in 1853.

47:24.760 --> 47:27.684
You really think Marius
could have found this in just a day?

47:27.840 --> 47:30.764
What you are saying? Marius is werewolf?

47:30.920 --> 47:34.208
But last night he was with us
when the werewolves attacked.

47:34.360 --> 47:37.091
He still might be one of them.
Maybe he can change...

47:37.240 --> 47:39.447
whenever he wants, like in Ingolstadt.

47:39.600 --> 47:43.127
Someone has circled all the jewels
that Hans supposedly collected.

47:43.280 --> 47:46.682
They're the same ones our werewolf
has stolen except one.

47:46.880 --> 47:49.042
It says it's a "carbonado."

47:49.200 --> 47:50.884
What's a "carnow"?

47:51.040 --> 47:57.810
- Carbonado. Beats me.
- Carbonado, very puzzlement, oui?

47:57.960 --> 48:02.087
Okay, time to make the crepes.
Breakfast in one hour.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.564
I'm not gonna last an hour.

48:04.720 --> 48:07.724
Hey, is Cap'n Fatty's Rib Ranch
open for breakfast?

48:07.880 --> 48:12.385
- Yeah.
- Then let's head on out, Scabby. Ha, ha.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.810
Shaggy Rogers.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.843
Like, do I know you?

48:28.000 --> 48:30.606
"A star is born."

48:30.800 --> 48:33.007
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, no.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.130
Hey, everybody.
We got a celebrity in the place.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.647
Shaggy, from that "Celestia" show.

48:41.800 --> 48:46.010
- Oh, my gosh, we saw you last night.
- You were so awesome.

48:46.160 --> 48:48.322
How'd you teach it all those tricks?

48:48.480 --> 48:54.044
- "It"?
- Um, you know, the usual way.

48:54.920 --> 48:58.242
- He's dreamy.
- He's dreamy.

49:01.400 --> 49:06.327
- Right this way, Mr. Rogers.
- Would you ladies care to join me?

49:09.080 --> 49:11.003
Huh? Hey.

49:13.280 --> 49:16.648
Order anything you want, sir.
It's on the house.

49:16.800 --> 49:18.723
And I'll bring a bone for your dog.

49:19.640 --> 49:20.687
A bone?

49:20.840 --> 49:24.367
So tell me more about how great I am.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.281
"Scabby." Hmph.

49:35.960 --> 49:40.249
- Care to explain this?
- Well, it's a book.

49:40.400 --> 49:43.483
You see, they print words on sheets
of paper, bind them together...

49:43.640 --> 49:46.246
It's a book about
the Ingolstadt werewolves.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.243
We found it in your office.

49:48.400 --> 49:50.562
And what, that makes me a werewolf?

49:52.880 --> 49:56.123
My office is usually unlocked.
Anyone could have planted it there.

49:56.280 --> 49:58.487
Mr. Brancusi?

49:59.400 --> 50:01.402
Oh, over here, Mr. Flaxman.

50:03.720 --> 50:04.767
It's Phil, heh.

50:04.920 --> 50:08.606
Call me Phil, everyone calls me Phil,
even my kids call me Phil. Heh.

50:08.760 --> 50:12.128
Come into my office please, Phil.

50:14.280 --> 50:18.001
If you'll excuse me,
I have some business to discuss.

50:26.440 --> 50:32.128
And then I said, "So tell me
more about how great I am."

50:40.320 --> 50:42.766
Disgusting.

50:42.920 --> 50:46.208
Who wants to get
the superstar another hoagie?

50:46.360 --> 50:48.761
- Oh, I'll get you one.
- No, me.

50:48.920 --> 50:51.241
- Me, I'll do it.
- Me first.

50:54.200 --> 50:58.205
- I want a hoagie.
- Don't worry, Scoob.

51:00.000 --> 51:04.130
Now that I'm a superstar,
I won't forget the little people.

51:04.280 --> 51:05.850
I mean, dogs.

51:06.040 --> 51:09.044
Little puppies...

51:09.200 --> 51:11.009
Ah. People.

51:11.160 --> 51:14.566
Pooples. Whatever.

51:21.280 --> 51:24.250
Are you ready to rock?

51:27.880 --> 51:34.490
You understand that by "rock"
I mean, "Watch a dog do tricks," right?

51:37.000 --> 51:42.530
Then behold my creation.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.730
Scooby, no.

52:46.680 --> 52:49.411
Don't leave me, buddy.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.250
Don't leave!

52:51.400 --> 52:54.802
Scoob. Scooby.

52:55.800 --> 52:58.451
Scoob. Scooby?

53:17.120 --> 53:19.441
Dude, can I borrow your shades?

53:19.600 --> 53:22.126
No!

53:22.280 --> 53:24.521
Chillax. I was just asking.

53:27.760 --> 53:33.210
No. Oh, good, you're still a dog.

53:33.360 --> 53:35.727
And you're still a jerk.

53:42.120 --> 53:44.407
What do you mean,
you won't do the show tonight?

53:44.560 --> 53:45.891
You heard me.

53:46.040 --> 53:48.441
- Oh, come on, Scoob.
- No.

53:48.600 --> 53:51.763
Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?

53:51.920 --> 53:53.490
Uh-uh.

53:53.640 --> 53:56.120
Would you do it for two Scooby Snacks?

53:57.000 --> 53:59.480
- Forget it.
- Fine.

54:00.680 --> 54:04.002
There's 342 pounds of Scooby Snacks here.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.321
You happy now?

54:07.520 --> 54:09.090
Yeah.

54:11.840 --> 54:14.525
Ha, ha. Happy now.

54:14.680 --> 54:17.001
I don't know
what you just talked him into doing...

54:17.160 --> 54:19.925
but he must've really not wanted to do it.

54:20.080 --> 54:23.004
Thank you, Phil.
We'll see you at tonight's show.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.561
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.681
Guess what.

54:27.840 --> 54:31.208
That man just bought out all the seats
for tonight's performance.

54:31.360 --> 54:34.921
We're doing a private show
for the Wulfsmoon guy.

54:35.120 --> 54:38.363
Wulfric Von Rydingsvard?

54:38.520 --> 54:41.649
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

54:44.520 --> 54:45.521
Oh, my gosh.

54:45.680 --> 54:49.287
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

54:50.880 --> 54:53.042
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

54:53.200 --> 54:55.168
Is he going to be all right?

54:55.720 --> 54:57.848
As all right as he ever is.

55:03.040 --> 55:06.044
I am not a werewolf.

55:08.040 --> 55:12.204
- I really don't think it's him, Velma.
- We'll see. Okay, so I found out...

55:12.360 --> 55:16.046
what a carbonado is.
It's also known as a black diamond.

55:28.280 --> 55:30.248
Thanks, Shaggy. Deaf in this ear now.

55:30.400 --> 55:32.562
Black diamond. Black diamond.

55:32.760 --> 55:35.730
- What?
- Wulfric. Wulfric. Wulfric.

55:35.880 --> 55:37.769
Shaggy. How about a verb?

55:39.840 --> 55:43.561
Wears! Wears! Wears!

55:45.560 --> 55:48.211
Let's see, if we put them together...

55:48.400 --> 55:52.803
Wulfric wears black diamond?

55:56.600 --> 55:59.524
Well, I guess we know
what the werewolves' next target is.

55:59.680 --> 56:03.127
And this time, we'll be ready.

56:05.680 --> 56:08.604
- We're not ready.
- It's okay, calm down.

56:08.800 --> 56:11.406
Calm down? We can't find Archambault.

56:11.560 --> 56:12.971
And look at his trailer.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.248
There's obviously been a struggle here.

56:15.400 --> 56:18.529
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the werewolf has struck again.

56:18.680 --> 56:19.806
You.

56:21.240 --> 56:23.641
- Where is she?
- She?

56:23.800 --> 56:27.486
Where is my Lena? You two are planning
to run off together, aren't you?

56:27.640 --> 56:29.961
What? No.

56:30.120 --> 56:33.090
- Don't lie to me.
- Oliverio, stop.

56:33.280 --> 56:35.282
Lena could have been
taken by the werewolf.

56:35.440 --> 56:38.284
Ha. Net boy is the only wolf I see.

56:43.240 --> 56:45.163
I hope Oliverio isn't too upset, Fred.

56:45.320 --> 56:48.403
Because you're going to be doing
the trapeze with him tonight.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.242
We can do this. We can.

56:52.400 --> 56:54.323
We just need to get through this show...

56:54.480 --> 56:58.087
then we can find out what happened
to everyone. All right.

56:58.240 --> 57:00.163
I'll take over most of Archambault's act.

57:00.320 --> 57:02.846
Velma, that means
I'll be helping you into the cannon.

57:03.720 --> 57:06.007
The cannon?

57:43.040 --> 57:44.201
They're here.

57:45.880 --> 57:47.120
There's Wulfric.

57:48.520 --> 57:50.329
He looks shorter in person.

57:50.480 --> 57:52.050
Okay. Here we go.

57:52.200 --> 57:55.841
There's just one thing
you have to remember...

57:56.640 --> 58:00.406
Yes? Marius?

58:02.360 --> 58:05.567
Oh. Like, not him too.

58:11.520 --> 58:14.922
Sisko is right. The show must go on.

58:15.080 --> 58:17.048
But what if the werewolves show up?

58:17.200 --> 58:18.531
I'm counting on it.

58:18.720 --> 58:22.202
We've got a little surprise
in store for them.

58:24.760 --> 58:29.163
The circus is a metaphor
for society, don't you think?

58:29.320 --> 58:33.769
Only instead of, like, rich people
and poor people, there's other things.

58:33.920 --> 58:36.924
So true, so true. Isn't it true?

58:37.080 --> 58:38.923
Mm-hm.

58:39.080 --> 58:40.889
- True.
- Shh.

58:41.720 --> 58:43.802
It's starting.

58:54.720 --> 58:56.609
Ladies and gentlemen.

58:56.800 --> 58:59.451
With the finest talent
from 10 continents...

58:59.600 --> 59:02.171
I thought there were only
seven continents.

59:02.320 --> 59:06.085
Well, they're discovering
new ones all the time.

59:06.640 --> 59:10.964
I present the Brancusi Circus.

59:24.960 --> 59:29.329
And now, Oliverio and Fred.

59:30.080 --> 59:32.242
Does that safety net look okay to you?

59:32.400 --> 59:38.169
No. Maybe the junior, second-assistant,
backup trapeze artist forgot to check it.

59:38.320 --> 59:39.651
Who?

59:39.840 --> 59:42.411
Oh, heh, that's me, isn't it?

59:42.560 --> 59:45.848
Yes. I guess you'd better hope
I don't drop you, eh?

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.080
No!

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.964
Bravo!

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.282
- You caught me.
- Of course.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.728
If I don't, you think anyone
ever gonna hire me again?

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.041
Well done.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.565
Get it? Huh?
The umbrella represents intolerance.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.604
Hmm, ha, ha. Yeah, oh, yeah.
Ha, ha. I get it.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.683
Hello, Wulfric Von Rydingsvard.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.242
Where? Where... Oh, right.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.081
I give you, Shaggy.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.003
- And his performing dog.
- Mm-mm-mm.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:51.081
- The guy in the dog suit is fantastic.
- That's a real dog.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.485
Phil, you fall for anything.
I bet you believe in kangaroos.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.120
They're here. Go.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:18.166
Now, this is what I've been waiting for.
Hello, wolfy-wolf-wolfy.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.769
Sorry, Schmatko. We'll get you
back to normal, if that's really you.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.331
Oh, not good.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.123
Fred!

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.966
Ow! That's a Titanium chain.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.649
Thanks so much for your help, everyone.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.486
Phil, you're the only one
who stood by my side.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.246
I always said you were
like a son to me, Wulfric.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.847
A wealthy, Swedish son
with a tenuous grip on reality.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.848
Good dog, good doggy,
don't bite Freddy now.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.607
So the affair goes on even now
that she's a werewolf, eh?

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.730
- You're crazy.
- Crazy in love.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.724
Come back to me, Lena.
I don't care if you're a dog.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.566
Bite me and we shall stalk the night
together, two wolves in love.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.851
Heh. You two obviously have some stuff
to work out, so I'll just be, uh...

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.203
At least I don't have to do
the cannon thing.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.571
- Strike.
- Hmph.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.209
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't introduce you.
But you can't stay mad...

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.682
Ha. I knew you still cared.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.162
- I'm coming, Scoob.
- Aah!

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.446
Like, leave my friend alone. Huh?

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.842
Red fur?

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.846
Zoinks!

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.604
What the...

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.881
They're gone.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.363
Shaggy. They're baboons.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.101
Baboons? Baboons.

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:43.204
Oh, man, what was that command
he used? Domingo.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.561
They're the trained baboons.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.485
Which means Doubleday must be behind this.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.966
Stop him.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.730
Oh, no.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.644
Fred. Fire.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.723
- Are you sure?
- Do it.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.330
Way to go, Velma.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:18.929
Oh, yeah. Best human comet ever.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:27.444
- Ow! That was glued on, you know.
- It's Doubleday, all right.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.167
Get back. You won't take us that easy.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.606
- What did you do?
- He's okay.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:46.130
Just tranquilizer gun Doubleday keep
around in case of problem with animals.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.170
- What are those ropes?
- Archambault tied up.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:53.370
But Archambault break ropes.
Such thick ropes.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.046
- It take hours.
- Where were you?

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.362
In storage shed, back there.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.569
- You okay?
- Who did this?

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.882
Did you catch him? What's going on?

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.371
It was Doubleday.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.204
We've already called the police.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.690
This would have never happened
at the Minsk conservatory.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.285
- How is he?
- This is strong stuff.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.920
He could be out for hours, days even.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.969
Where did my amulet go?

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:34.011
I've got men searching for it,
and all the other stolen jewels.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.085
If we don't find them, we can get
the information from Doubleday.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:41.164
My circus is supposed to be
in Philadelphia tomorrow.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.685
Will that be a problem?

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.162
No. If we need you, we'll contact you.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.525
You were the best thing in the show,
my friend, and that dog costume is brilliant.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.921
Dog costume?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.002
Thanks again for all your help.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.248
Are you sure I can't give you anything?

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.050
We did some major box office.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.771
This thing is crammed with cash.

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:11.245
No, thanks. We're just glad we could help.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:15.644
Well, any time you want to see
the circus, it's on the house.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.241
And all the churros you can eat.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.925
Yes.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.801
And maybe I could do
the high-wire again, huh?

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.602
Uh, let's think about
whether that's probably maybe best, um...

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.127
Anyway, um, goodbye.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.921
Archambault say goodbye also.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.446
Goodbye, Archambault.
Thanks for everything.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.047
Okay. I hope they find all those jewels.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:47.485
Especially that black diamond,
it seemed very nice, oui?

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.681
- Hey, motorcycle girl.
- Schmatko.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:57.168
I guess Sisko told you I could never get
your umbrella routine right.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:02.167
No, he say umbrella routine
was funny for first time ever.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.288
Oh, uh...

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.010
No, no, is good.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:10.164
This finally make me decide
clowning is not for me.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:15.121
So now I go to New York
to pursue my true love, theater.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:18.807
That's great, Schmatko.
I'm sure you'll be a huge success.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:23.283
Of course, Sisko will miss me terribly...

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:30.326
but a man has got to be doing
what it is that a man has got to be doing.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.209
Do svidaniya, all. Goodbye.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.966
Goodbye.

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.522
I thought he'd never leave. Cheers.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.889
Well, another case solved.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.850
I don't know.
Something's still bugging me.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.685
Yeah, I miss the part where the bad guy
says he would've gotten away with it...

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.571
- ...if it hadn't been for us.
- Wait.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.529
Archambault said "black diamond."

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.046
But the last he heard,
that gem was a carbonado.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.964
- So?
- And do you remember...

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.011
- ...what Doubleday said?
- You won't take us that easy.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.170
He said "us."
Archambault caught Doubleday...

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:10.563
after he tranquilized him.
He could have the black diamond.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.487
And Archambault said he broke his ropes,
but that rope hadn't been broken.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.563
The ends looked like they'd been cut.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.881
And the book.

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.050
Archambault was the one
who knocked it off the shelf.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.283
I'll bet he planted it there.
It all adds up.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:29.363
Archambault was in on it.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.245
We've got to catch that train.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.606
- Come on, come on.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:50.281
Uh-oh. Look.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.920
We gotta get on that train somehow.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.242
What? What are you looking at?

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.402
Shaggy, how far can you jump?

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.926
Huh?

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:08.565
Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no. No. No!

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.291
Come on, guys, jump so I can get up there.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.609
How did we get talked into this, Scoob?

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:22.242
How can you still be mad?
I said I was sorry.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.169
Too late, Daphne.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.529
- I guess it's just us, Scoob.
- Hmph.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.446
Boy, he really can hold a grudge.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.166
Tell Archambault where is key
or Archambault get angry.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.926
This isn't angry?

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.090
- We gotta stop him.
- We?

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.847
Scooby-Doo, like, dude, I'm sorry.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.369
You're the best friend a guy could have,
and you're the best circus performer too.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.681
That's right.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.640
Won't you please forgive me,
old buddy, old pal? Heh.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.170
Oh, maybe.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.005
I know it was wrong
to treat you like a trained animal.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.369
I was a complete...

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.727
Trained animals.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.046
- Hey.
- Stop please.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.521
- Slow down. Stop.
- Stop that train.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.964
Ah, it's so nice to see young folks
taking an interest in the railroads.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.531
Hey, animals. We need your help.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.787
Um...

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.041
Allow me.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.206
Scooby speaks baboon? Who knew?

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.242
Ha. Best superb.

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:32.446
Archambault just wants to say he has
enjoyed doing the business with you. Huh?

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:40.601
Ha, ha. Archambault never punch
a horse before. Could be fun.

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:53.646
Sleepy time for the monkeys.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.883
Huh? What?

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.804
Where are the darts?

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.281
Don't worry, I got them right here.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.400
No! Bad monkeys!

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.645
Like, what do we do now?

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.725
Hello, peoples.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.882
- Run!
- Run!

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.483
Come back here, dog and hippie.
Archambault won't hurt you much.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.847
Did he just call me a hippie?

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.961
Jump.

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.129
- Huh?
- Well, duh.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.649
- Thanks, buddy.
- Anytime, pal.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.165
Archambault not built for the long jump.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.081
Scoob. I got an idea. Follow me.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.241
What?

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.004
My...

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.525
- Good work, Shaggy.
- You too, Scoob.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.566
This guy is tough.

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:29.530
I think those tranquilizers
are starting to wear off already.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.127
Apparently, Archambault
and Doubleday were both angry...

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.011
when my uncle left me the circus.

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.801
I understand it.
They worked for him for years...

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.964
then suddenly his nephew comes in
and wants to change everything.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.408
And then, when Archambault saw
that Doubleday was caught...

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.570
he double-crossed him,
hoping to buy himself enough time...

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.849
to make off with the jewels
and the box-office money.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.844
And Archambault would have
get away with it...

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.925
if it don't be for the young peoples
and the nosy dog, there.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.447
Oh. I do like to hear that.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.611
Guess that wraps it up.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.086
I got your call.
Hey, that's a train. Choo-choo!

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.527
Mr., uh, Wulfric, sir?

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:24.089
Um, hi. Ha, ha.
Uh, we caught Doubleday's accomplice...

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.766
and, uh, he had this in his pocket.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.604
Brilliant. Just brilliant.

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.042
That one's my second favorite.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.683
I really gotta thank you.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.683
And I have to thank you again.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:45.368
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- They won't take money, I tried that.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.807
Well, there must be something, right?

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.409
Hmm. Maybe there is.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.851
Like, man, this is the best. Heh.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.800
- Right, buddy?
- You said it, amigo.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.725
- Hello, Cleveland.
- We're in Atlantic City.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.805
Right. Hello, you guys.

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:22.248
- Are you ready to rock?
- Yes!

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.731
Totally!

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.486
Well, I need a minute.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.563
Mystery Inc., Mystery Inc.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:44.088
They helped me out a lot, I think

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.403
Mystery Inc., Mystery Inc.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:51.167
They helped me out a lot, I think

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:54.324
There's a dog named Scooby
And some other guys

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.887
And I said I'd write them a song

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.550
But I forgot to

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.850
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

01:18:07.305 --> 01:18:13.343
