pain medication.

If she walks into a wall,
that just means it's working.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.558
- So, Doctor, if Churro
needs one tranquilizer,

00:16.599 --> 00:18.685
she weighs 10 pounds...
- Mm-hmm.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.855
- How much would a dog need
that weighed, like, 200 pounds?

00:21.896 --> 00:24.190
Like, 20?

00:26.317 --> 00:27.652
This isn't funny, okay?

00:27.694 --> 00:31.531
This big dog needs a lot
of pills to feel anything.

00:31.573 --> 00:32.824
- What? No.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.826
I was just laughing
at this TikTok Mayan made.

but she can eat like one.

And so can I, because
humans can enjoy it too.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.653
[evil laugh]

- You have the evil laugh
of a man who owns a rocket ship

shaped like a penis.

It has all the horse flavor,
but none of the horse.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.303
- Well, I mean,
why did they pick you?

01:35.345 --> 01:36.971
Shouldn't a famous dog
be selling the food?

I mean, listen,
don't take this wrong, Mayan,

a little start-up,

bucks for vet school.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.774

My pet lizard and I

- No, Mayan.

Because of her videos,

02:03.832 --> 02:06.626
the clinic's TikTok account
has thousands of followers.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.169
- Thanks.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.713
Bone-jour even asked if I'd
host a promotional event here

be livestreamed.

Pride is one

I don't understand
human emotions.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.090
Why wouldn't I be okay?

02:54.132 --> 02:55.884
- 'Cause you were just talking
about your accomplishments

02:55.925 --> 02:57.302

We don't say "put down"

03:05.018 --> 03:07.687
- My dad wasn't insulting me.
He's just keeping me grounded.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.272
That's what Latino parents do.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.857
- My parents do the same thing,

03:10.899 --> 03:12.275
and I'ma tell them
it's not right

03:12.317 --> 03:15.820
as soon as I'm no longer
on their cell phone plan.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.197

it's a bad thing

that I can take advantage

But as your friend
and fellow woman,

03:27.290 --> 03:29.876

03:30.919 --> 03:32.879
- You've got to stop putting up
with your dad's crap.

03:32.921 --> 03:36.049
Is he ever supportive
or say anything nice to you?

03:36.091 --> 03:39.719
- He makes fun of me the least
out of everyone in the family.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.555
What am I supposed to do?

03:42.597 --> 03:44.557

if we do grooming.

- Chance, honey, do you know
this sweaty, awkward man?

04:33.148 --> 04:35.400
- Yeah, I'm his father.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.194
Wait, did George talk to you?

04:38.236 --> 04:39.320
- I don't know who George is,

04:39.362 --> 04:41.114
but this boy's last name
is Lopez.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.283
If you were his real father,
you would know that.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.784
- It's hyphenated.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.537
So his mom is Lopez,
I'm Van Bryan.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.290
And if you were a real teacher,
you would know that.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.916
- You claim he's your kid,

04:51.958 --> 04:53.501
but he writes his name
as Chance Lopez

04:53.543 --> 04:56.421

I really appreciate you

but we're late.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.760
So, Chance,
tell this woman I'm your dad

Good job.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.345
Did you find that

05:45.387 --> 05:48.973

the normal way to react

05:49.015 --> 05:51.267
when someone you care about
accomplishes something

05:51.309 --> 05:52.560
they care about.

- I don't care
about the disposal.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.980
I clogged it on purpose
for the free rent.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.236
- I'm just gonna say it.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.529
I don't like the rude things
you said

06:02.570 --> 06:04.781
in front of my coworkers
today.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.700
- I wasn't being rude.
I was just keeping it real.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.576
You were getting a big head.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.038
And not in a handsome way
like mine--look.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.207
- That's toxic behavior.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.793
And I'm so used to it
that Brookie and Dr. Pocha

06:16.835 --> 06:18.044
had to point it out
for me to realize

06:18.086 --> 06:20.171

of celebrating

06:20.213 --> 06:21.506

06:21.548 --> 06:23.299
- That is not true.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.553
I celebrate the makers
of this beer every night.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.808
- You know, I don't think I've
ever heard you say the words,

06:31.850 --> 06:33.351
"I'm proud of you."

06:33.393 --> 06:34.811
Not even when I was a kid.

Remember what you told me

after my middle school
musical performance?

06:38.481 --> 06:39.816
When I asked you
how my singing was,

06:39.858 --> 06:42.694
you told me to dance louder.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.241
- Yes, because your feet
can actually hit a note.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.492
- Words matter, Dad.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.869
- Yes, Mayan.
I'm aware.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.579
That's why I don't just
throw them around.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.788
Want me to tell you
I'm proud of you

06:53.830 --> 06:57.334

You called me a hot mess

06:58.668 --> 07:01.755

Just say that
you're proud of me.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.259

Obviously, I'm a POC.

A Parent of Chance.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.567
- Well, I don't know.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.945
He looks like
a young Oscar Isaac,

08:06.986 --> 08:10.198

08:12.158 --> 08:14.661
- Yeah, Chance dropped
my last name at school.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.038
So he's just going
by Chance Lopez now.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.124
- Well, probably because
Chance Van Bryan

08:19.165 --> 08:22.877

08:24.838 --> 08:26.464

get vulnerable with you

08:26.506 --> 08:27.757
for a second.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.300
I'm afraid that
he's embarrassed of me.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.469
And Mayan was embarrassed
of George when she was a kid.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.555
They didn't speak for 10 years.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.682

08:35.724 --> 08:38.977
but maybe Chance is ashamed
of his whiteness.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.854
[chuckles] Actually,
I don't hate to say it.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.814
It felt good.

08:45.817 --> 08:49.112
Look, he lives in a house
surrounded by Latinos.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.740
Maybe you should
teach him something

08:51.781 --> 08:54.534
about your side of the family.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.119
- That's a good idea.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.955
I just--I don't want him
to be ashamed of who he is.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.915
You know,
I want him to be proud.

09:00.957 --> 09:05.545
- Hm, so you want him
to be a proud white man?

09:05.587 --> 09:08.715

that I want him to be a...

Complaining that I never
tell her I'm proud of her.

09:25.523 --> 09:29.569
I must have said it one time
behind her back accidentally.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.113
That's gotta count
for something.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.323

you're proud of me,

09:33.365 --> 09:37.035
but luckily,
thanks to my ADHD...

09:41.706 --> 09:44.376
- My grandmother only told me
she was proud of me one time,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.211
when I told
child protective services

09:46.252 --> 09:50.173
that we were playing frisbee
with a chancla.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.342
- I think you should
just tell her, man.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.178
She won't let it go.
She's Gen Z.

We're at the end

09:59.432 --> 10:04.145
Sad to think that this will be
the last generation of mankind.

10:06.398 --> 10:09.317
- If I tell her,
it'll be because she asked me,

10:09.359 --> 10:11.361
not because I wanted to,
obviously.

10:11.403 --> 10:14.739
It would seem so
just dis-indigenous.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.077
- Disingenuous.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.830

10:27.043 --> 10:30.463
- Wow. That's a good job.
That's a perfect blunt.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.925
Tight as a taquito to get us
loose as a burrito.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.137
- You're so good to me, man.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.139
You really know how to show
someone you appreciate them.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.348
- Yeah.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.726
Because I'm not a sayer.
I'm a show-er.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.019
- And I'm not a show-er.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.354

10:55.697 --> 10:58.450

in here.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.161
I don't see why your dad
wouldn't be proud of you.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.875
- You don't think I look silly?

11:06.916 --> 11:08.501
- I actually find it
much easier

11:08.543 --> 11:11.463
to talk to you like this.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.590
- You guys are just being nice.
My dad was all--

11:13.631 --> 11:15.133
- Don't listen to him.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.011
- Yeah, you don't need
your dad's validation.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.471
You make great videos.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.681
You're helping put this place
on the map.

11:21.723 --> 11:25.435
You even eat dog food
and make it look orgasmic.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.938
- Actually,
I do a little trick.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.857
I hide a piece of turkey jerky
in my palm

11:30.899 --> 11:32.859
and switch it
at the last minute.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.653
- So you're pretending
to like it?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.364
- Yeah, it's gross.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.699
TikTok Mayan fully stands
behind the product,

11:39.741 --> 11:42.327
but real life Mayan
thinks that crap is nasty,

11:42.369 --> 11:45.121
which is why when I ask
for a volunteer to try it,

11:45.163 --> 11:47.207
Brookie's gonna say...

11:47.248 --> 11:49.793
- [enunciating] Girl,
I am just a random stranger

11:49.834 --> 11:52.879
who does not know you at all.

11:54.839 --> 11:59.636
- And that acting is why Lizzo
doesn't have a sponsorship.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.639
Just say you want to try it
and take the jerky.

12:02.681 --> 12:05.016
- See, you've got everything
worked out.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.685
You're gonna kill it out there.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.020
So it doesn't matter
what your dad thinks.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.690
Just keep him out of your head.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.233
- Keep him out of my head.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.902
Keep him out of my head.
Keep him out of my...

12:17.404 --> 12:21.866

to keep him out of my head

when we can't keep him
out of the building.

Wow, that's a beautiful dress.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.671

12:39.718 --> 12:42.178
- Why are you here?
To make fun of me?

12:42.220 --> 12:44.139

I'm about to do
my presentation.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.025
- Okay.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.652
Do you want a scratch
behind the ear for good luck?

to pup-peroni, to pup-puccinos.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.216
Hey, when a pun works,
a pun works.

13:23.970 --> 13:29.059
Most importantly, no dog
can resist its delicious taste.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.147
- Yes.

13:34.189 --> 13:38.026
- And neither can I.

13:38.068 --> 13:41.404
Mmm. Delicious.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.324
These got me wagging for more.

Now, can I get a volunteer from
the crowd to give it a try?

13:51.498 --> 13:52.916
- Oh.

13:52.957 --> 13:56.294

a volunteer from the crowd?

a bearded dragon

13:59.255 --> 14:02.676

14:02.717 --> 14:06.638
- No one's trash enough
to eat dog food.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.683
- I'm trash. I'll eat it.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.644

what are you doing up here?

14:17.607 --> 14:19.693

pride isn't just saying it.

these treats are delicious,

14:28.368 --> 14:31.913

- Well, he's 90% alcohol,

16:29.781 --> 16:32.951
I had my DNA analyzed,
and according to the results,

16:32.992 --> 16:36.830
I am Dutch,
British, and German.

Don't worry about it.
