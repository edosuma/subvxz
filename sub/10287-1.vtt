- Warrants to sign, sir.
- Mac, where do you get all that energy?

00:07.629 --> 00:10.655
I run about 30 miles a week.
Guess I picked that up in the Army.

00:10.832 --> 00:13.460
I remember when only tough guys
went in for that stuff.

00:13.635 --> 00:16.297
10Ks, marathons.
Now it's the latest rage.

00:16.471 --> 00:19.406
In ranger training,
I had to cover 50 miles with no supplies...

00:19.574 --> 00:22.566
...then kill a chicken with my bare hands
for lunch.

00:23.912 --> 00:26.540
That probably won't catch on.

00:28.149 --> 00:31.175
- Nice job on that last case.
- Thanks.

00:31.353 --> 00:34.083
- How about a drink after work?
- I don't drink.

00:34.723 --> 00:37.055
- I know an all-night disco.
- I don't dance.

00:38.226 --> 00:41.195
- Wanna just come up to my place?
- I don't like you.

00:42.497 --> 00:46.797
Well, I don't like you either.
You don't see that stopping me, do you?

00:47.602 --> 00:48.967
We're ready.

00:49.137 --> 00:54.268
We get out of here at 4:00 in the morning,
and she wants somebody to like.

00:56.077 --> 01:00.810
- There you go, Mac.
- Next case, Your Honor. Attempted robbery.

01:02.784 --> 01:04.775
Who'd she stick up?

01:05.387 --> 01:08.220
- That's a joke, Mac.
- Yes, sir, very amusing.

01:10.358 --> 01:14.556
I swear I had no idea she was a nun.
Her back was turned. All I saw was black.

01:14.729 --> 01:17.061
The greatest story ever told.

01:17.232 --> 01:20.065
Hey, I may be a criminal,
but I have a sense of piety.

01:20.235 --> 01:21.793
Sure you do.

01:21.970 --> 01:24.837
Hey, I even had a Saint Christopher medal
in my car.

01:26.107 --> 01:28.803
Okay, it wasn't my car,
but it was my medal.

01:32.013 --> 01:34.072
Has she been checked
for concealed weapons?

[GIGGLES]

01:37.218 --> 01:39.652
The defendant tried to grab
Sister Williams' purse...

01:39.821 --> 01:43.120
...at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
We have witnesses and affidavits.

01:43.291 --> 01:45.316
Your Judge, as a former altar boy...

01:45.493 --> 01:49.054
...I just wanna say that I got nothing
but utmost reverence for the Church.

01:49.230 --> 01:52.597
If it pleases the court,
the state would like to chuckle.

01:53.101 --> 01:56.593
I mean, what kind of an idiot robs a nun?
Nuns are holy.

01:56.771 --> 01:58.671
Nuns are consecrated. Nuns are...

01:58.840 --> 02:00.467
- Broke.
- Exactly.

02:01.910 --> 02:06.438
Your Honor, the plaintiff was standing in full
view, directly in front of the Rodin exhibit.

02:06.614 --> 02:10.880
Rodin. Hey, I love that guy.
How about those <i>Gates of Hell,</i> huh, Sister?

02:12.220 --> 02:15.383
Well, when it comes to the
unabated horrors of human suffering...

02:15.557 --> 02:17.286
...nobody does it better.

02:18.593 --> 02:22.324
<i>Queen for a Day</i> had its moments too.

02:22.497 --> 02:26.058
Mr. Pina, the evidence indicates
that you have committed a Class C felony.

02:26.234 --> 02:28.498
I haven't committed a mortal sin, have I?

02:28.670 --> 02:30.900
You wanna field that one, Sister?

02:31.072 --> 02:32.403
I can forgive the sinner.

02:32.574 --> 02:34.439
PINA:
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

02:34.609 --> 02:36.133
But not the sin.

02:36.311 --> 02:39.075
- Game and match, Sister Sara.
- Game and match.

02:39.647 --> 02:41.842
All over for a grand jury. Next case.

02:43.084 --> 02:45.644
Hey, wait a minute.
What am I so worried about?

02:45.820 --> 02:49.119
I'll repent, and God will forgive me.
Heh, heh, heh.

02:49.290 --> 02:52.521
"Vengeance is mine," sayeth the Lord.

02:59.134 --> 03:03.070

I wanted to make sure that you didn't
misunderstand my intentions last night.

04:20.447 --> 04:22.348
You wanted cheap casual sex.

04:22.517 --> 04:24.917
Good. You didn't misunderstand.

I find you base, disgusting, lewd,
vile and obscene.

You like chickens?

05:00.755 --> 05:03.451
- Forget the chickens.
- I'm Sara.

Of course you are.

As in Sister Sara.

Get out of here.

05:13.735 --> 05:15.828
No, really, I am.

05:16.904 --> 05:18.565
You are.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you with clothes on.

- I mean, l...
- Guess what.

- What?
- I am no longer a nun.

05:26.381 --> 05:28.576
- They fired you?
- No.

05:28.750 --> 05:32.516
I decided to resign,
and I have you to thank.

05:34.155 --> 05:39.092
I have been agonizing over this decision
for a long time.

05:39.260 --> 05:43.026
For six years, I have been living in a world
that just wasn't right for me...

05:43.197 --> 05:46.496

commitment meant, understand?

05:46.968 --> 05:48.458
No.

A municipal court judge
acting so lighthearted and carefree.

You showed me that it was possible
to be committed to something...

06:00.648 --> 06:04.311
...without sacrificing freedom
and spontaneity.

06:04.986 --> 06:07.284
I was making chicken lips.

06:08.489 --> 06:12.118
So I have finally decided
what I really want...

06:12.293 --> 06:15.854
...is to have a crazy
wild love affair with life.

out of proportion.

07:55.463 --> 07:58.432
She told me herself
that she just dropped by to thank me...

07:58.599 --> 08:05.562
...and to tell me that she wanted to have
a crazy, wild love affair with life.

Rex Baltimore.

08:18.386 --> 08:20.411
Whoa, I've heard this.

08:21.722 --> 08:27.126
When I was very young,
Rex Baltimore was a radio announcer.

08:27.295 --> 08:30.458
He had a voice that would melt butter.

08:30.631 --> 08:36.227
Every night, I would lie next to my radio
and listen to Rex.

08:36.404 --> 08:41.102
I sent him letters. He sent letters back.

08:41.275 --> 08:43.640
I used to hang them over my bed.

08:43.811 --> 08:45.574
That's sweet.

08:47.215 --> 08:52.778
Then one day, he called me up
and asked me out to dinner.

08:54.121 --> 08:56.180
But he never showed up.

08:56.357 --> 08:58.655
I'll never forget how much it hurt.

08:58.826 --> 09:00.521
Gee, that's too bad, Selma.

09:00.728 --> 09:06.030
The point is, this girl is very innocent...

09:06.200 --> 09:09.829
...and very trusting, like I was.

09:10.271 --> 09:13.536
She can be hurt very easily, Harry.

09:13.708 --> 09:15.539
Just don't forget that.

09:15.943 --> 09:19.242
That's quite a story, Selma. Thanks.

09:20.815 --> 09:22.112
Selma.

09:22.283 --> 09:24.615
Did you ever find out
why Rex didn't show?

09:24.785 --> 09:26.047
Yes.

09:26.220 --> 09:29.018
The Hindenburg fell on him.

09:34.128 --> 09:36.926

09:37.532 --> 09:38.556
What's next?

09:38.900 --> 09:43.860
- Do the words "chow down" ring a bell, sir?
- Oh, yes, Your Honor. We're starving.

09:44.038 --> 09:46.404
You can't ignore her forever, Harry.

09:51.045 --> 09:52.910
One more case, huh?
We'll work up an appetite.

09:53.080 --> 09:56.345
That's what you said an hour ago, sir.
Now mine's worked up real nice.

09:56.517 --> 09:59.145
Now, I mean,
it's ready for something raw.

09:59.720 --> 10:04.248

grow weak and then die on your floor.

10:04.859 --> 10:07.851

- Anita Fries and Arnold Burger.

10:08.029 --> 10:11.760

of prostitution, robbery and assault.

How nice, but in the interest of time...

10:26.881 --> 10:29.577

on the insignificant details.

10:34.188 --> 10:36.281

It's very simple.

I have a strict no-refund policy.

provided neither goods nor services.

- Oh, come on.

- One little remark does not make me a p...
- Mr. Prosecutor.

10:55.242 --> 10:58.234
I believe she was referring
to your witness.

10:58.412 --> 11:00.380
Of course she was.

to submit Mr. Burger's demands...

...concerning their business arrangement.

and put it over here...
