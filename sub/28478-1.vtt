Merry Christmas, baby.

Merry Christmas to you.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.523
Are you sure you have
to go to work today?

03:13.568 --> 03:14.568
It know.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.818
It sucks.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.007
Listen, when I get home
tonight, we'll celebrate.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.031
All right?

03:19.866 --> 03:20.901
Are you sure?

03:20.951 --> 03:23.408
Because I got you something.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.739
Babe, we said no gifts, come on.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.872
I know, I couldn't help it.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.499
It love it.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.330
Good.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.379
I love you.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.195
Listen, it's probably
gonna be another day

03:39.219 --> 03:41.175
of waiting around for a friggin'
cat to jump out of a tree.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.510
I have som errands to run today.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.158
Do you want anything
special for dinner tonight?

03:44.182 --> 03:45.217
Just you.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.178
Unless you feel like
making that pasta again.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.038
Remember, the one with
the onions and the chicken

03:49.062 --> 03:50.177
and the mushrooms
and the peppers.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.849
Oh no, go ahead, keep it up.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.138
You'll be pleasantly surprised

03:53.191 --> 03:55.227
by a bowl of your
favorite cereal.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.187
T love cereal.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.192
Nothing wrong with cereal.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.857
You're lucky I love you.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.362
Tease me with a good time.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.366
Chief, go ahead, chief.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.246
I heard it, I'm on my way.

04:59.758 --> 05:00.793
Come on, Jen.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.674
One coffee, three creams.

05:07.724 --> 05:08.884
Have a merry Christmas.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.925
You too, babe, thanks.

05:20.737 --> 05:24.525
This is go for Bradley,
go for Bradley.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.282
Is that a 10-547

06:11.204 --> 06:12.068
Captain.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.122
Detective.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.657
Come take a look at this.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.959
What else do we know about him?

06:24.009 --> 06:25.340
Not much,

06:25.343 --> 06:28.631
other than he was released from
north side about a week ago.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.680
I eft a note.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.850
Who is this sick fuck?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.353
That's your job, detective.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.795
Let me introduce
you to miss Clayton.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.922
She found him this morning
when she came home from work.

06:44.946 --> 06:45.946
Officer?

06:48.074 --> 06:49.484
I'm so sorry for you loss.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.240
I just have a few questions.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.366
Have a seat.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.412
Merry Christmas.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.835
Tell me about Robert.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.097
What do you wanna know?

07:14.142 --> 07:15.382
What happened?

07:19.397 --> 07:22.810
He loved me, he loved his job.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.850
He just never should've
take that assignment.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.439
What assignment?

07:26.488 --> 07:28.854
Some government
thing, I don't know.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.523
I never knew what he did.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.409
Tell me about his
original conviction.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.779
10 years ago, just
after new years,

07:37.832 --> 07:38.832
2000.

07:40.919 --> 07:45.288
Robert went away on
assignment like he always did.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.580
This was no different.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.215
They said they caught
his car on camera

07:49.260 --> 07:50.875
hit a man walking.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.214
Died on impact.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.422
The more you tell me,

07:55.433 --> 07:57.424
the more I can help.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.184
He never killed that man.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.848
But they sure tortured
him like he did.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.640
When your husband was in prison,

08:05.694 --> 08:09.278
did he have any friends or
enemies that you can think of?

08:10.448 --> 08:11.483
Its' prison.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.737
But he did talk about a Mark.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.912
He said they were both
wrongly sentenced.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.122
This is my card.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.004
Call me if you think
of anything else.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.049
I'm sorry.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.299
I'm gonna figure this out.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.940
Merry Christmas, Doug.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.527
Merry Christmas, Jen.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.740
Merry Christmas.

11:08.793 --> 11:09.623
Hey.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.582
How was it?

11:10.628 --> 11:11.538
- Crazy.
- Yeah?

11:11.588 --> 11:12.623
Crazy good? - Better now.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.540
Good.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.454
How as your dayâ?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.043
Good, just hung around here.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.047
Did some research for work.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.629
Studied for the bar exam.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.172
Oh yeah, how's that going?

11:20.221 --> 11:21.586
It's really hard.

11:21.639 --> 11:22.628
But I think the firm
I'm working with

11:22.640 --> 11:24.631
is gonna hire me on if I pass.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.552
I got assigned a new case.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.432
What about?

11:26.477 --> 11:27.512
Nothing important.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.052
- What's for dinner?
- Guess.

11:29.105 --> 11:29.969
What's this?

11:30.023 --> 11:30.762
Nothing.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.146
You made pasta.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.648
I did, merry Christmas.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.979
What?

11:36.029 --> 11:39.897
Do you remember this morning
when I said I'd be home tonight

11:39.949 --> 11:41.485
and we can celebrate?

11:41.534 --> 11:42.534
Yes.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.657
Are you serious right now?

11:46.664 --> 11:48.655
Will you marry me?

11:48.666 --> 11:49.826
Yes.

12:13.691 --> 12:14.691
Gotcha.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.444
So what'd you find out?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.358
Tell you what I know.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.743
His name's Robert Clayton.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.532
He was a us marine
before doing 10 years

13:10.581 --> 13:12.492
for murdering his partner
over at north side.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.061
Turns out there was
no proof he did it.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.541
He was released
about a week ago.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.325
Well haven't you learned?

13:16.379 --> 13:17.744
They're all innocent.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.650
Yeah but get this, his
original sentence was life.

13:19.674 --> 13:22.086
Someone fought the system
to have his file expunged.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.750
Then they gave him therapy.

13:23.761 --> 13:24.921
Weird, right?

13:24.971 --> 13:26.086
Yeah, very.

13:27.765 --> 13:28.629
Go ahead.

13:28.683 --> 13:29.422
Keep looking into it.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.475
Yes, sir.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.479
Happy holidays, north
side correctional.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.685
Warden, please.

13:38.735 --> 13:39.770
Warden speaking.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.046
Warden, this is
detective Bradley

13:41.070 --> 13:43.026
with goffstown
police department.

13:43.072 --> 13:46.030
I'm investigating the recent
release of Mr. Robert Clayton.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.531
Don't know how I can help.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.317
He was murdered.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.639
I'd like to come in
and speak with you.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.153
How'd tomorrow morning?

13:52.206 --> 13:53.787
Good.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.782
See you at eight.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.481
Goffstown police department!

15:23.589 --> 15:24.589
Chief.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.878
I'm out at Clayton's.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.876
Something's going on here.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.465
Hey, everything okay?

16:09.510 --> 16:10.249
Yeah.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.338
Everything's fine.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.378
Doug, what's going on?

16:15.057 --> 16:16.843
Are you here by yourself?

16:16.893 --> 16:17.632
Yes.

16:17.685 --> 16:18.891
Yes, I'm here.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.640
What's going on?

16:22.690 --> 16:25.932
You're scaring me,
what is going on?

16:30.490 --> 16:31.490
Come in.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.942
Good morning, Mark.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.944
Please, have a seat.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.407
How you feeling?

16:40.958 --> 16:42.949
Happy, I'm assuming,
that you're released now.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.958
Look at me!

16:47.965 --> 16:49.296
Tell me where jt isl

16:49.342 --> 16:50.457
it don't know!

16:50.510 --> 16:52.466
Where is it?!

16:52.512 --> 16:53.718
Where is...

16:53.763 --> 16:56.220
I don't know!

16:56.265 --> 16:57.755
T understand.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.969
Haven't figured it out yet.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.345
Where is it?!

17:04.397 --> 17:05.262
I don't know.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.055
Tell me where it is!

17:06.108 --> 17:07.848
It don't have it!

17:07.902 --> 17:11.065
Have you tried what I suggested?

17:29.006 --> 17:29.791
Good morning.

17:29.840 --> 17:30.579
Gentlemen.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.123
Just another day.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.698
Detective Bradley,
here to see the warden.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.007
Sure, he's been expecting you.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.015
Thank you.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.095
Good morning, Doug.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.011
Warden.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.513
Have a seat.

17:47.567 --> 17:51.025
I'm here investigating the
release of Mr. Robert Clayton.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.939
What can you tell me about him?

17:52.989 --> 17:54.024
Very little.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.613
We released him
about a week ago.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.445
He did 10 years

17:58.494 --> 18:00.485
for murdering his partner.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.950
Apparently the system was wrong.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.739
Seemed liked a nice guy.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.703
Kept to himself.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.993
Was married, two kids.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.287
Was happy to finally get out.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.466
Why?

18:14.635 --> 18:15.635
He's dead.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.574
Does he have any enemies
or anyone on the outside

18:18.598 --> 18:20.054
that you may know of?

18:20.057 --> 18:22.013
Not the I knew of.

18:22.059 --> 18:27.053
Listen, I don't know much
more than what I've told you.

18:28.399 --> 18:29.876
Did he receive any special
treatment while he was here?

18:29.900 --> 18:32.232
As you know, we're a
private correctional facility

18:32.278 --> 18:35.315
for ex-military and
government personnel.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.901
His treatment was basic food,

18:39.035 --> 18:39.865
closed cell,

18:39.910 --> 18:41.821
visitation once a month

18:41.871 --> 18:43.452
and if lucky enough
to be released,

18:43.497 --> 18:46.113
a government appointed
psychologist.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.453
[T's the same for everyone.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.084
Robert Clayton was no different.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.041
How did he get out?

18:53.090 --> 18:55.797
That's not for me to determine.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.878
Warden, you should know every
single one of your inmates

19:00.931 --> 19:02.967
and why they were released.

19:03.017 --> 19:05.804
His case was
reopened and discharged

19:05.853 --> 19:10.847
on the basis of not enough
evidence for a full conviction.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.807
His sentence was shortened.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.021
It happens all the time.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.777
Listen, Doug,

19:16.822 --> 19:18.187
that's all I know.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.778
I have to do rounds.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.824
Call me if you
need anything else.

19:25.873 --> 19:26.737
Thank you.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.201
One more question, real quick.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.115
Who reopened his case?

19:31.337 --> 19:34.079
That's also none of my business.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.792
Thanks for coming in.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.053
Thank you.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.142
Hello, doctor?

19:48.145 --> 19:49.726
This is Rick.

19:49.772 --> 19:53.811
Just wanted to confirm my
appointment for this afternoon.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.190
Thank you, sir.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.707
I can't sleep.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.760
I can't eat.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.170
I don't even remember what
I was doing that night

20:24.181 --> 20:25.181
or why.

20:26.767 --> 20:30.601
We never even found what
we were looking for.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.056
You're all trained that way.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.142
You have deep-rooted emotions

20:34.191 --> 20:35.931
that cause the blackouts.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.148
Don't worry, you're
right on schedule.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.357
Why me?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.738
Because you're the best.

20:46.537 --> 20:47.947
Okay.

20:47.997 --> 20:48.997
Send him in.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.208
Mark,

20:53.502 --> 20:55.208
I'm gonna give you something.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.043
It's gonna help you sleep.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.089
Okay?

20:59.216 --> 21:00.216
Trust me.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.755
It's gonna be okay.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.684
Have a seat.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.974
I'm sure you're happy
to be finally released.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.187
How are you feeling?

21:19.236 --> 21:20.692
Okay, I guess.

21:20.738 --> 21:25.323
Are you ready to get started
on your final assignment?

22:24.301 --> 22:25.962
Hey, do you know that guy?

22:26.011 --> 22:27.296
Yeah, his name's Mark.

22:27.304 --> 22:31.388
He's been coming here
for a couple of days.

23:01.755 --> 23:02.835
What is it?

23:05.342 --> 23:06.342
It's okay.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.176
It's just a dream.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.221
Go to sleep.

23:12.516 --> 23:15.132
I'm gonna take a shower.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.661
Yeah?

24:17.706 --> 24:18.821
Another what?

24:20.000 --> 24:23.242
Shit, all right,
I'll be there in 10.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.017
Captain.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.849
Take a look at this.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.028
I know this guy.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.073
You do?

24:53.659 --> 24:54.990
Something doesn't make sense.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.115
What doesn't make sense?

24:56.161 --> 24:57.446
Ll ooks like a suicide to me.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.240
It's not a suicide.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.449
His name's Mark.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.197
He was at the same bar
I was at last night.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.491
Was he with anyone?

25:03.544 --> 25:05.330
No.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.461
Funny thing is, he as released
from the same exact prison

25:07.464 --> 25:09.455
as Robert Clayton, a week ago.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.206
Do you think it's coincidence?

25:11.260 --> 25:12.466
Any ideas?

25:12.469 --> 25:13.469
One.

25:38.996 --> 25:41.578
Miss Clayton, I'm so sorry
to barge in on you again.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.488
But I jut have
one more question.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.207
The gentleman that your
husband allegedly killed,

25:46.253 --> 25:48.494
was there any relationship
between those two?

25:48.547 --> 25:51.505
Yes, actually,
he was his partner.

25:51.508 --> 25:52.508
Hmmm.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.380
Rick.

25:59.433 --> 26:00.718
Welcome back.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.224
How do you feel?

26:02.269 --> 26:03.349
I'm tired.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.760
I can't sleep.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.303
I have no family.

26:06.356 --> 26:10.474
Everyone thinks I'm
a friggin' murderer.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.643
Sometimes, a way to
deal with frustration

26:12.696 --> 26:15.733
is to find where its purpose is.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.648
You served your
country, young man.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.450
I killed my partner.

26:20.496 --> 26:21.531
Rick,

26:21.580 --> 26:22.932
you were placed on watch
for your own safety

26:22.956 --> 26:25.538
until the dust settled.

26:25.542 --> 26:28.534
Something had happened while
you were on the inside.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.252
For 10 years 1
went through hell.

26:31.298 --> 26:33.004
Do you even know what
happened in there?

26:33.050 --> 26:35.382
What they did to me?

26:35.427 --> 26:38.339
I don't have it, never did.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.548
What, exactly?

26:39.598 --> 26:40.553
It don't know.

26:40.557 --> 26:41.557
Nothing.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.101
The government needs
your help once more.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.807
I'm not interested.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.107
This is not your choice.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.611
It's an order from the Pentagon.

27:03.664 --> 27:04.824
Babe,

27:04.873 --> 27:05.988
are you okay?

27:10.587 --> 27:12.168
It just doesn't make any sense.

27:12.214 --> 27:13.441
Here's a guy that
served 10 years

27:13.465 --> 27:15.547
at a private military
prison for murder,

27:15.592 --> 27:16.923
a murder nobody has seen.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.177
There's no evidence,
there's no records, nothing.

27:20.222 --> 27:23.259
He gets released and
someone wants him dead

27:23.308 --> 27:24.593
and just yesterday,

27:24.601 --> 27:26.592
somebody else from
that same exact prison

27:26.603 --> 27:28.719
shows up dead in an alley.

27:29.690 --> 27:32.602
No records on that one either.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.609
Are you sure the guy from
last night wasn't a suicide?

27:35.612 --> 27:37.148
It don't think so.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.779
Who're you calling?

27:42.828 --> 27:44.159
I love you, don't wait up.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.799
What're you doing here?

29:01.823 --> 29:03.438
Came to see you.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.893
How'd you know where to find me?

29:11.917 --> 29:14.704
Where else would you be?

29:28.141 --> 29:30.553
Is dad still over at the church?

29:30.602 --> 29:31.717
Yeah.

29:31.728 --> 29:32.728
I think so.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.312
Man, it's been a long time.

29:36.358 --> 29:37.358
Yeah.

29:38.735 --> 29:39.895
Since mom died?

29:46.243 --> 29:48.108
Hey, Doug, look at this.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.867
Give me that, it's not a toy.

29:50.747 --> 29:51.747
Mom!

29:59.756 --> 30:01.166
Listen, Doug.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.553
Hey, come on.

30:13.687 --> 30:16.724
I ook, man, it wasn't your fault.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.764
Okay, you gotta know that.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.152
It know.

30:22.821 --> 30:23.821
I know.

30:24.823 --> 30:25.778
And you being out
here all these years

30:25.782 --> 30:26.692
isn't gonna bring her back.

30:26.742 --> 30:27.606
You know that, right?

30:27.659 --> 30:28.523
That's not why I'm here.

30:28.577 --> 30:29.441
Then why are you?

30:29.494 --> 30:31.780
You would not understand that.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.099
Listen, Doug, just
because you're a cop,

30:33.123 --> 30:36.707
doesn't meant you can
save the world, okay?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.815
And you can't run away every
time something bad happens.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.581
Is that what you think I did?

30:43.633 --> 30:45.589
You think I can away?

30:45.635 --> 30:46.590
Then why'd you go?

30:46.636 --> 30:47.796
Because I couldn't stand

30:47.804 --> 30:49.590
to fucking be
around here anymore!

30:49.639 --> 30:53.928
Every single day being constantly
reminded of what happened.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.683
So I thought maybe,

30:56.897 --> 31:00.810
just maybe if I did
something good with my life.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.854
I don't know, man, I
thought it would get easier.

31:03.904 --> 31:07.362
That's exactly the
reason I became a cop.

31:07.407 --> 31:12.401
There's the hope that one
day my life would get better.

31:12.829 --> 31:13.829
Well,

31:14.998 --> 31:17.489
I know why you're here.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.954
Can't figure out who's
killing those people.

31:20.003 --> 31:20.867
What do you mean?

31:20.921 --> 31:22.252
Let me ask you this.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.879
Those people that were released.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.007
Wrongful conviction?

31:27.052 --> 31:28.667
Look,

31:28.720 --> 31:30.210
I've interviewed
both the families,

31:30.263 --> 31:31.924
I've looked into
both the murders.

31:31.973 --> 31:36.387
The only connection I can
find is the prison system.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.436
Bingo.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.068
Anything yet?

31:51.118 --> 31:52.403
I'm working on it

31:52.452 --> 31:53.513
but there's some real
shit going on here.

31:53.537 --> 31:54.868
Well, stay on top of it.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.327
That's why you're
a detective, Doug.

31:56.373 --> 31:57.373
Thank you.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.091
You couldn't do it?

33:36.723 --> 33:37.963
Why not?

33:37.974 --> 33:39.885
Did you go to the park?

33:39.935 --> 33:40.935
Yes.

33:41.978 --> 33:45.061
I understand this
is difficult for you.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.971
Did he at least have it?

33:46.983 --> 33:48.189
It don't know.

33:49.569 --> 33:52.561
I didn't see anything on him.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.980
I feel like I've seen
him before, who is he?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.866
He's your assignment, solider.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.784
You have to let your frustrations
come to the surface.

34:02.832 --> 34:03.893
Why don't you take the night off

34:03.917 --> 34:06.203
and try again tomorrow, okay?

34:09.005 --> 34:10.290
Yes, send him in.

34:13.552 --> 34:14.552
Why me?

34:16.221 --> 34:18.507
You are fully
trained to do this.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.717
This is what you do.

34:20.766 --> 34:23.007
You were trained by the best.

34:23.018 --> 34:24.475
You are the best.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.272
Well, well, well.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.154
It's been awhile.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.453
This is the warden.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.788
This is detective Bradley

34:49.838 --> 34:51.543
from the goffstown
police department.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.045
Please fax me a list
of all the inmates

34:53.049 --> 34:54.914
sentenced for murder in 2000

34:54.967 --> 34:57.050
and then released for
wrongful conviction.

34:57.053 --> 34:58.259
Certainly, detective,

34:58.305 --> 35:00.045
I'll have my secretary
pull the records.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.387
What are you thinking?

35:01.433 --> 35:04.049
I think it's closer to
home than we would like.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.346
Let me know if there's
anything else you want.

35:06.396 --> 35:08.307
You'll have it shortly.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.067
Here's what I got.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.068
I think Robert and Mark
knew each other in prison.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.562
According to their files,

35:17.616 --> 35:20.073
they were both sentenced for
murder in January of 2000

35:20.076 --> 35:22.738
but then released
early for good behavior

35:22.787 --> 35:24.072
within days of each other.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.241
Doesn't make any sense.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.202
What'd the coroner
say about Mark's death?

35:28.251 --> 35:29.957
Suicide? Murder?

35:30.003 --> 35:31.118
He said overdose,

35:31.171 --> 35:32.565
which is weird because
the bartender said

35:32.589 --> 35:34.830
he seemed happy to be alive.

35:34.883 --> 35:37.374
It just doesn't make any sense.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.756
Fax for you, detective.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.015
Thank you, sir.

36:33.566 --> 36:34.976
What the fuck?

36:54.587 --> 36:56.703
You wanna explain this?

36:57.882 --> 36:59.213
You wouldn't understand.

36:59.259 --> 37:00.169
Really?

37:00.176 --> 37:01.176
Ry me.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.173
This is a recent list of
everyone that was released

37:08.184 --> 37:10.175
from north side in January 2000.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.302
You're number six on here.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.190
My situation's a
little different, Doug.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.196
Right.

37:22.198 --> 37:23.859
If this is someone's
sick wishlist,

37:23.908 --> 37:25.489
we're running out of time.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.617
Why is your name on here?

37:28.663 --> 37:30.199
Do you know what's going on?!

37:30.206 --> 37:32.697
Listen, we were all
ex-military, okay?

37:32.751 --> 37:34.207
Secret service types.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.620
Black ops.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.106
The whole point point is
we were sent on a mission,

37:37.130 --> 37:41.214
in secret, that the government
did not want public.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.582
Who hired you?

37:42.635 --> 37:43.635
The nsai

37:44.679 --> 37:47.637
the whole point was to
find a missing drive.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.718
Wait, what drive, what's on it?

37:49.768 --> 37:51.053
Data?

37:51.102 --> 37:52.455
Okay, we were each
ordered to follow

37:52.479 --> 37:54.331
a different member of the
NSA, the secret service,

37:54.355 --> 37:56.220
until the drive surfaced

37:56.232 --> 37:57.597
and then, I don't know, man.

37:57.650 --> 38:00.232
Days later, we were ordered
to terminate our partners.

38:00.236 --> 38:01.589
I don't understand,
why is your name on here?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.399
Why weren't you locked up?

38:03.448 --> 38:05.689
Because they led us to
believe they were in on it

38:05.742 --> 38:06.969
and then it became
a situation where

38:06.993 --> 38:09.405
it was fucking
kill or be killed.

38:09.454 --> 38:12.036
That's why you have six
deaths and six convictions.

38:12.081 --> 38:14.914
And we wonder why this country's
in the shape that it is.

38:14.959 --> 38:15.959
Listen,

38:16.002 --> 38:17.242
when an order goes out,

38:17.253 --> 38:18.242
whether you fucking
agree with it or not,

38:18.254 --> 38:19.994
vou see it through.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.380
This was absolutely
no different.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.461
This became survival.

38:24.511 --> 38:26.126
Who's your direct contact now?

38:26.179 --> 38:27.510
I went off grid, Doug.

38:27.555 --> 38:28.840
I don't have one.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.426
But I can tell you this.

38:30.475 --> 38:31.994
If they knew I was
talking to you about this,

38:32.018 --> 38:33.599
they'd kill us both.

38:36.856 --> 38:39.268
You leave it alone, Doug.

39:08.304 --> 39:09.168
Hey, baby.

39:09.222 --> 39:10.222
Amy.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.676
Listen.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.386
I know you don't
know what's going on.

39:14.435 --> 39:17.393
I know, we need to talk.

39:17.438 --> 39:20.100
It's just not
safe at home, okay?

39:20.149 --> 39:21.013
Doug, I...

39:21.067 --> 39:22.211
I'll tell you when I see you.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.315
I love you.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.308
And Amy,

39:24.320 --> 39:25.309
trust no one.

39:25.321 --> 39:26.686
Okay.

39:26.739 --> 39:27.739
I love you.

39:51.514 --> 39:52.514
I'm sorry.

39:57.687 --> 39:59.097
I miss you, mom.

41:27.777 --> 41:30.268
Yes, actually, his partner.

41:32.949 --> 41:33.949
Mom!

42:47.940 --> 42:48.940
Shit!

42:50.526 --> 42:52.141
Are you okay today?

42:52.195 --> 42:53.526
No.

42:53.529 --> 42:55.520
You take care of yourself.

43:23.559 --> 43:24.719
What do we got?

43:24.769 --> 43:25.975
Take a look.

43:30.233 --> 43:31.188
Know this guy?

43:31.234 --> 43:32.644
No, why?

43:32.693 --> 43:34.729
Check your list.

43:34.779 --> 43:36.986
North side correctional?

43:44.539 --> 43:47.576
I want you to go over
there and figure this out.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.448
All right, I'm on it.

44:12.608 --> 44:13.608
(Get in.

44:15.736 --> 44:16.600
Jason, right?

44:16.612 --> 44:17.601
Yeah.

44:17.613 --> 44:18.853
Three more to go.

44:18.906 --> 44:19.645
What's this all about?

44:19.699 --> 44:21.064
Why you?

44:21.117 --> 44:22.553
I was hired for
my particular skill

44:22.577 --> 44:24.442
in transcoding
encrypted messages.

44:24.495 --> 44:25.610
Okay.

44:25.621 --> 44:26.610
Okay, so in '99,
the government stored

44:26.622 --> 44:28.408
some very, very important data

44:28.457 --> 44:30.288
on two identical
drives as backup.

44:30.334 --> 44:31.687
What do you mean,
data? What kind of data?

44:31.711 --> 44:33.372
Lop secret military intel, man.

44:33.421 --> 44:36.629
I'm talking missions, financials,
nation security plans,

44:36.632 --> 44:38.623
locations of missiles
that protect our boarders.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.416
Like, a lot!

44:40.469 --> 44:41.879
Who has the drive now?

44:41.929 --> 44:44.636
The president and the NSA.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.951
Okay, so let me
better understand this.

44:45.975 --> 44:47.590
They order you guys
to commit murder,

44:47.643 --> 44:49.538
lock you up for 10 years,
call up protective custody

44:49.562 --> 44:51.018
only to let you
out then kill you?

44:51.063 --> 44:52.098
Pretty twisted, right?

44:52.148 --> 44:53.388
Very.

44:53.441 --> 44:55.898
I thought this was
over a long time ago.

44:55.943 --> 44:58.400
You thought wrong.

44:58.446 --> 45:00.277
Hey, be careful.

45:00.323 --> 45:02.109
These guys, they
are the government.

45:02.158 --> 45:05.150
They can and will find
you if you get too close.

45:47.536 --> 45:48.400
Chief brown.

45:48.454 --> 45:50.536
North side has to be involved.

45:50.581 --> 45:53.368
I can't explain but
remember that list?

45:53.417 --> 45:54.748
Yeah.

45:54.794 --> 45:57.706
Well those three guys that
were killed were on that list.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.624
There's three more.

45:59.674 --> 46:01.039
I need to find them.

46:01.092 --> 46:04.175
Right, well keep digging
and tell me what you find.

46:04.220 --> 46:05.710
All right.

46:11.727 --> 46:12.716
So,

46:12.728 --> 46:15.014
how's it feel to be a hero?

46:17.233 --> 46:19.394
He was the enemy.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.729
He was the last remaining mole.

46:21.737 --> 46:24.729
You did your country
a great service.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.190
Did anyone see you?

46:28.661 --> 46:29.661
No.

46:30.288 --> 46:31.528
(Great.

46:31.580 --> 46:34.242
Just one more thing to do.

46:51.934 --> 46:54.141
Good morning, detective.

47:09.618 --> 47:10.357
Sir!

47:10.411 --> 47:11.411
Excuse Mel!

47:13.372 --> 47:14.612
What's going on?!

47:14.665 --> 47:18.374
Yes, sir, he's here
now, I'll call you back.

47:18.419 --> 47:19.909
That was your boss.

47:21.464 --> 47:25.798
I was assigned to house six
soldiers that went rogue.

47:25.801 --> 47:28.793
It was my understanding that
these men killed us military.

47:28.804 --> 47:29.668
Why you?

47:29.722 --> 47:30.928
Why here?

47:30.973 --> 47:33.009
After the news was released
about these soldiers,

47:33.059 --> 47:37.644
I was given the assignment to
put them on top level watch.

47:37.688 --> 47:39.269
I did my job.

47:39.315 --> 47:42.773
10 years later, they were
released due to lack of evidence,

47:42.818 --> 47:44.024
or so I hear

47:44.070 --> 47:45.810
so you mean innocent?

47:45.821 --> 47:47.311
Do you even know what they did?

47:47.365 --> 47:48.980
My job is to lock them up.

47:49.033 --> 47:51.820
To feed them and make sure they
don't see the light of day.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.110
It is not to ask questions.

47:54.163 --> 47:56.825
You're right, that's my job.

47:56.832 --> 47:58.743
Where are these guys at now?

47:58.793 --> 48:00.203
I would keep my distance.

48:00.252 --> 48:03.665
If they've managed to hide
six government murders

48:03.714 --> 48:04.829
for a decade,

48:04.840 --> 48:07.923
they probably can hide yours.

48:07.968 --> 48:09.674
Is that a threat, warden?

48:09.720 --> 48:12.086
If I find out that you're
behind this in any way,

48:12.139 --> 48:15.176
I will lock you up behind
the very bars that you guard.

48:15.226 --> 48:16.341
Be careful.

48:18.270 --> 48:20.636
Please see to it that Doug
gets the known addresses

48:20.689 --> 48:23.055
to the names that he requests.

48:25.945 --> 48:27.810
Thank you.

48:27.863 --> 48:29.228
Have a good day.

48:39.083 --> 48:40.698
He's getting help.

48:59.478 --> 49:00.888
Come on, come on.

49:02.565 --> 49:03.850
What did I tell you?

49:03.899 --> 49:05.252
There's some real
shit going on here.

49:05.276 --> 49:06.711
Doug, you're gonna end up
dead like the rest of 'em.

49:06.735 --> 49:07.921
What do you want me to do, huh?

49:07.945 --> 49:09.435
You want me to walk away?

49:09.488 --> 49:10.568
Do you have that list?

49:10.614 --> 49:11.353
Yes.

49:11.407 --> 49:12.647
My name's on it, yeah?

49:12.700 --> 49:13.564
Yes.

49:13.617 --> 49:14.617
Like six names?

49:15.744 --> 49:16.744
Okay.

49:19.623 --> 49:20.988
Il never went to prison,

49:21.041 --> 49:23.748
yet my name is right
here on this list.

49:23.794 --> 49:24.658
Then who was released?

49:24.712 --> 49:26.202
Jesus Christ, detective Doug.

49:26.255 --> 49:27.836
Don't you think it's about time

49:27.882 --> 49:29.609
for you to start figuring
some shit out at this point?

49:29.633 --> 49:32.466
Listen, it's time you start
telling me what's going on!

49:32.511 --> 49:33.375
Who was your partner?

49:33.429 --> 49:34.919
His name was Andrew aikens.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.087
Where is aikens now?

49:36.140 --> 49:37.425
Figure something out.

49:37.475 --> 49:40.888
Stop asking so many
fucking questions.

50:14.094 --> 50:16.130
You'll have more than freedom.

50:16.180 --> 50:18.091
You'll have peace.

50:18.140 --> 50:20.882
Your country owes you.

50:20.935 --> 50:22.971
This is your final assignment.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.247
I can't believe I did 10 years

50:24.271 --> 50:26.557
for a murder I
was ordered to do.

50:26.607 --> 50:29.565
You will be rewarded
for your continued service

50:29.610 --> 50:31.817
and given the highest of ranks.

50:31.862 --> 50:33.978
Why was I locked up again?

50:33.989 --> 50:35.854
For your safety.

50:35.908 --> 50:37.899
Everyone was that was
on the assignment.

50:37.952 --> 50:40.409
You were cleared and released.

50:40.454 --> 50:41.454
Safety?

50:43.541 --> 50:44.951
Rust me.

51:07.606 --> 51:09.437
Why is he following me?

51:16.198 --> 51:17.483
Are you following him?

51:17.533 --> 51:18.397
Yes.

51:18.450 --> 51:20.031
Remember what I told you.

51:20.077 --> 51:21.908
He has what we need.

51:23.038 --> 51:25.279
This is it, right?

51:25.332 --> 51:27.038
Daniel, trust me.

51:28.043 --> 51:30.250
This is the final stage
of your treatment.

51:30.296 --> 51:31.690
Once completed, you
will be rewarded

51:31.714 --> 51:35.798
with the highest honors
of military ranks.

51:35.843 --> 51:37.629
This is for your freedom.

51:37.678 --> 51:38.678
Yes, sir.

51:52.443 --> 51:55.059
I know everybody's been
under a lot of pressure,

51:55.070 --> 51:57.061
working a lot of overtime.

51:57.072 --> 51:58.903
We don't catch a lot
of murders around here,

51:58.949 --> 52:00.940
let alone three.

52:00.993 --> 52:02.483
So what do we know?

52:02.536 --> 52:05.403
They were all
patients at north side.

52:05.456 --> 52:07.071
We think they're all connected.

52:07.124 --> 52:09.786
The only problem is how.

52:09.835 --> 52:12.076
I'm gonna give you
guys a list of names.

52:12.087 --> 52:13.247
Robert Clayton,

52:14.381 --> 52:15.461
Mark Swanson,

52:17.092 --> 52:18.298
Jason mcdaniels.

52:20.179 --> 52:23.467
We've got reason to believe
that there's gonna be more.

52:23.515 --> 52:28.100
Hopefully we can stop it
before it gets any further.

52:28.103 --> 52:29.593
Not sure if this is related.

52:29.647 --> 52:33.890
There was a disturbance last
night behind factor street.

52:33.942 --> 52:36.479
Okay, well three names
I something to work with.

52:36.528 --> 52:39.110
I want everybody to keep their
eyes and their ears open,

52:39.114 --> 52:40.729
stay sharp,

52:40.783 --> 52:41.783
get to work!

52:44.119 --> 52:46.110
Now get out of here!

52:46.121 --> 52:48.112
I got a tip about
suspicious activity

52:48.123 --> 52:49.123
down at the pig farm.

52:49.166 --> 52:50.781
Get over there after this.

52:50.834 --> 52:51.834
All right.

52:57.007 --> 52:57.746
Amy.

52:57.800 --> 53:00.132
We need to talk.

53:00.135 --> 53:01.215
What's up?

53:01.261 --> 53:02.530
I think the
case you're working on

53:02.554 --> 53:04.010
is related to what
I was assigned.

53:04.056 --> 53:04.966
What do you mean?

53:05.015 --> 53:06.425
I tried to tell you.

53:06.475 --> 53:10.059
I saw on your computer the
same names as what I was given.

53:10.104 --> 53:11.139
What names?

53:11.146 --> 53:13.137
Robert Clayton, Mark Swanson,

53:13.148 --> 53:14.934
Jason mcdaniels and some others.

53:14.983 --> 53:17.224
Apparently, they spent
time at north side

53:17.277 --> 53:19.768
and they all filed appeal
for wrongful conviction

53:19.822 --> 53:21.483
and mistreatment but...

53:21.532 --> 53:24.695
Amy, promise me you're
not gonna look into this.

53:24.743 --> 53:26.153
It's not safe.

53:26.161 --> 53:29.653
Doug, your
brother was on that list.

53:29.707 --> 53:30.707
It know.

53:31.333 --> 53:32.539
Amy,

53:32.584 --> 53:34.620
do not look into it.

53:34.670 --> 53:35.785
Okay.

53:37.005 --> 53:38.836
Please be careful.

53:38.882 --> 53:41.168
All right, I love you, bye.

53:57.192 --> 53:59.183
Now's not a good time.

54:01.655 --> 54:02.770
We need to talk.

54:02.823 --> 54:04.188
Right.

54:04.199 --> 54:08.568
Unfortunately, we're gonna have
to reschedule for tomorrow.

54:11.081 --> 54:13.059
You haven't spoken to anyone
about the mission, have you?

54:13.083 --> 54:14.083
No.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.075
Good.

54:16.128 --> 54:17.789
Remember your orders.

56:03.068 --> 56:04.399
Captain.

56:04.444 --> 56:07.356
Hey, we got something going on
down here at 15 pine street.

56:07.406 --> 56:08.896
I need you.

56:08.949 --> 56:10.314
Right.

56:18.792 --> 56:21.078
What's up, guys?

56:21.128 --> 56:22.413
This is not okay.

56:32.264 --> 56:33.424
I'm having boys.

56:47.362 --> 56:49.102
Rick, are you here?

57:35.035 --> 57:36.275
What do we got?

57:36.328 --> 57:38.910
We got one dead in the
kitchen, one ran off.

57:38.956 --> 57:40.412
Who is it?

57:40.415 --> 57:41.245
Rick.

57:41.291 --> 57:42.326
Get this,

57:42.376 --> 57:44.867
he was number four on the list.

57:46.213 --> 57:47.794
What do you think?

57:49.091 --> 57:50.091
Daniel.

57:55.597 --> 57:59.510
All extra units to 15
pine street, goffstown.

58:09.444 --> 58:10.444
Tape it off.

59:10.589 --> 59:13.501
There's something going
on in this town, dad.

59:13.508 --> 59:16.341
There's something in this
down that we've never seen.

59:16.386 --> 59:17.466
Can I help?

59:19.181 --> 59:20.181
No.

59:21.183 --> 59:22.593
Dad,

59:22.642 --> 59:24.052
Ryan's involved.

59:25.020 --> 59:26.885
He doesn't look good.

59:26.938 --> 59:28.519
- Is he okay?
- No.

59:30.525 --> 59:32.561
Dad, Ryan's at the cabin.

59:35.072 --> 59:36.562
T miss the cabin.

59:40.660 --> 59:41.740
I wanna help.

59:42.954 --> 59:44.364
It's not safe.

59:47.709 --> 59:50.075
I'll let you know.

01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:11.565
Chief.

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:13.317
What's up?

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:16.563
I gotta take you off this case.

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:17.902
Why?

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:21.566
Because the NSA and the
FBI are both involved.

01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:25.194
You know I can't do that,
my brother's on that list.

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:26.578
I don't know, there's
nothing I can do.

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:29.118
It's out of my hands.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:33.661
I was at the house last
night where Rick was murdered.

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:35.024
If we could just
get in front of it.

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.458
No, you can't.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.589
You take me off this case,

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:46.052
take me off payroll.

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:47.101
Doug.

01:00:47.936 --> 01:00:49.096
Figure it out!

01:01:22.304 --> 01:01:23.304
Ryan?

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.640
Ryan?!

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:28.767
Ryan?!

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:32.510
Ryan, are you in here?

01:01:32.564 --> 01:01:33.644
Ryan?!

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:36.817
Ryan?!

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:07.389
Oh my god.

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:22.947
Yes,

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:24.865
of course.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:46.714
He wasn't there.

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:48.757
Are you sure he has it?

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:50.217
Yes, I'm sure!

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:18.950
Get me the warden!

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:33.344
I'm a detective with the
goffstown police department.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:34.974
I need a minute of our time.

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.635
May I come in?

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:38.144
Yes, have a seat.

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.770
What's your full name?

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:43.937
Dr. Stevens.

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:47.646
What's this about?

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:50.177
I'm investigating
the recent murders

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.783
of some of the inmates
that were sentenced here.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:56.071
Yes, I've been hearing
about that on the news.

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:57.614
How can I help?

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.783
Did you know any of them?

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:01.955
Well, I am the
appointed psychologist

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:04.872
for all the inmates released
from north side correctional.

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:06.664
What do you know?

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:11.966
I'm sorry but I can't
speak about their files.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:14.035
Is there anything you'd
like to share about Robert,

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.344
Mark,

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:16.678
Rick,

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:19.845
or Jason, before you
started treating them?

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:23.686
I treat them all
like anyone else.

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:25.100
Listen, detective,

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:29.233
if you would want to
discuss anything further,

01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:33.195
I'd be more than happy
to make an appointment.

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:36.577
Just one last question, doctor.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:41.458
Are you speaking with Daniel
or Ryan Bradley currently?

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:45.621
I'm sorry but I can't
discuss anything further.

01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:52.135
Thank you for your time.

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:01.848
Ti need the warden.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:19.830
Doug, meet FBI agent fellows
and NSA agent Hendricks.

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:23.867
They will be taking the
case over from here on out.

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:28.876
Chief, what's going on?

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:32.296
In short, this is now
a federal investigation.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:33.572
You are to hand
over all your materials

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:36.508
to these two
gentlemen immediately.

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:38.965
Tt is what it is.

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:42.893
Chief, I've got you...

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:45.354
You've got nothing.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.139
Stevens.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:47.192
Do it now!

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:49.987
Officer.

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:53.112
Thank you for your efforts.

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:56.900
Chief, I know this
is way above our heads

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:59.027
but I don't think
we can trust them.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:05:59.910
Trust who?

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:01.745
The government?

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.873
Listen, 10 years
ago, the us government

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:06.910
backed up military
securities onto a drive.

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.036
I mean everything.

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:10.250
Launch codes, military weapons,

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.164
passwords,

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.707
encrypted messages,

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.170
you name it.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.926
They said it went missing.

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:17.466
Stolen.

01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:18.925
Now someone's looking for it.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:21.140
What're you talking about?

01:06:21.186 --> 01:06:22.204
These are the last remaining men

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:23.934
that know anything about it.

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:25.166
They were all hired to find it.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:26.726
Now they're coming up dead.

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:27.934
Why?

01:06:27.942 --> 01:06:29.044
I think someone knows
something about it

01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:31.559
and they're trying
to flesh it out.

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:32.613
Damn.

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:34.529
What are you saying?

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:37.407
Doug, you can't take
on the us government.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:40.944
No, I can't but
I'm in way too deep.

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:42.570
If I just have a
little bit more time,

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:44.535
I can probably stop
whatever is planned.

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:46.074
Doug, you're in
way over your head.

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:47.867
It doesn't make sense.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:48.660
Why here?

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:50.044
Who knows?

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:51.734
But we just can't sit and
watch from the sidelines

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:53.965
with what we know.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:56.630
If you get in the way of
a government investigation,

01:06:56.679 --> 01:07:00.012
you're gonna find
yourself in Cuba.

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:01.468
Doug, be careful.

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:04.475
I'm not supporting this.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:07.058
The last name on that
list is my brother.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:09.563
And he's one of the
only three remaining.

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:11.816
If I give up now,

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.977
I might as well burry him.

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:43.327
So what do you
think we should do?

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:45.012
I don't know.

01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:48.845
Do you have it?

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:51.014
I don't even know what's on
the drive you're looking for.

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:52.025
You don't need to know.

01:07:58.032 --> 01:07:59.032
Hmmm.

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:04.406
You're free to go.

01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:05.455
I'm done?

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:09.032
Enjoy the rest of your life.

01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:45.068
Warden sparks, please.

01:08:46.663 --> 01:08:48.654
Warden, we need to talk.

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:19.268
Were you followed?

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:20.322
No.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:22.988
Good.

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:24.240
Who's left?

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:25.285
Ryan.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.118
Daniels said he didn't have it.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:30.113
Do you believe him?

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:31.124
No.

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.118
What do we do?

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:38.129
We keep looking
until we find it.

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:47.451
Warden, I brought
this over to you

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:50.136
10 years ago with an agreement.

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:53.180
Do you remember that agreement?

01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:54.231
Yes.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:58.350
Mr. warden sparks.

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.314
My name is Dr. Stevens.

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:03.605
You are being given
custody of six soldiers.

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:08.448
They are being sentenced to
life for espionage and murder.

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:11.158
They were part of
a covert operation

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:14.498
for the recovery of
the missing drive.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.751
I believe one of them
still has it hidden.

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:17.876
What drive?

01:10:19.173 --> 01:10:23.257
A drive worth more money than
you or I could ever imagine.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:26.920
We need to find it, who
has it and where it is.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:30.636
Your cooperation will
be handsomely rewarded.

01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:35.178
How do you know someone has it?

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:36.599
Because 1 know.

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:43.353
This drive holds
top secret intel.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:45.192
Two copies were made

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:48.657
in case y2k caused
an computer crash.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:51.240
And what's your involvement?

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:54.201
This is a direct assignment

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:55.539
from Washington.

01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:01.288
I will be acting as the
internal psychologist

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.750
for all inmates.

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.922
If it gets out,

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:08.336
even for a second,

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:11.221
I will hear about it.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:17.103
Your job is to get them talking.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.771
How long do we have?

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:22.229
As long as it takes.

01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:24.522
They have it, I'll get it.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:28.656
I did my best.

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:41.084
Is it done?

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:43.256
Yes.

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:46.294
Good.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:48.926
Now find Ryan and his brother.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:15.949
What is this?

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:25.162
What the fuck is this?

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:37.519
Come on.

01:12:38.563 --> 01:12:39.973
I wanna see you.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:13.365
Sir!

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:15.523
You gotta see this.

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:19.819
I'm printing it out now.

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:24.501
Good work.

01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:26.704
Y2k, sir.

01:14:26.754 --> 01:14:28.710
We gotta get this
to the commander.

01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:29.756
Shit.

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:37.636
Got something here.

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:40.424
43 degrees north,
71 degrees west.

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:42.390
That's in New Hampshire, sir.

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:44.301
Give me agent
fellows and the FBI.

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:45.595
Yes, sir.

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:47.805
FBI.

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:50.315
Ryan has the drive
and he's on the move.

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:51.521
Okay, we're on it.

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.231
The drive has surfaced.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.645
Who's left?

01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:56.510
Everyone's dead
except for Ryan and Stevens.

01:14:56.534 --> 01:14:57.649
Good.

01:14:57.702 --> 01:14:58.908
Not good.

01:14:58.953 --> 01:15:01.444
Ryan's brother is a
cop who is on the case.

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:02.444
Who's his boss?

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:03.445
He's dead.

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:05.448
This guy isn't an ordinary cop.

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:06.824
He won't go down easy.

01:15:06.877 --> 01:15:08.959
That's because he's
emotionally invested.

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:10.961
It's his brother we're after

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:13.464
make him look like
another corrupt cop.

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:14.467
Yes, sir.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.210
Get me the president.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:28.684
Mr. president.

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:30.473
Yes?

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:33.476
Operation y2k has surfaced, sir.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.485
Let me guess.

01:15:35.489 --> 01:15:36.489
Ryan.

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:38.731
We think so, sir.

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:41.992
This guy's been hiding
in our own backyard.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:43.494
Who's on it?

01:15:43.497 --> 01:15:46.489
FBI agent fellows and
NSA agent Hendricks, sir.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.331
This drive became
active this morning,

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:51.335
we've got a real problem
if this gets out.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.167
Make sure this ends quietly

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:56.423
and find him, now!

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:57.469
Yes, sir.

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:18.656
Lee.

01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:20.773
We found it.

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:27.116
And kill him.

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:37.756
Wait here.

01:16:37.802 --> 01:16:39.212
Keep it running.

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:46.559
We gotta go.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:47.829
They're killing everyone
who was involved.

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:49.093
Who is?

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:50.477
Th government, the FBI, the NSA.

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:51.917
We're just collateral
damage at this point.

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:52.805
This doesn't make any sense.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:54.098
Why the FBI? Why the NSA?

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:56.107
Who do you think's
in charge, Doug?

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:58.235
Detective, please
come to the door!

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.362
You answer that
door and we're dead.

01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:01.943
You were followed.

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:23.336
Follow them!

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:42.689
Where is he going?

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.637
I fucking lost him!

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:15.600
Ryan, what's
really on that drive?

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:16.513
I already told you, man.

01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:18.273
Top secret military information.

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:21.561
Okay, locations,
missions, financials.

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:22.614
Come on.

01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:28.328
This way.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:42.550
Ryan,

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.008
I'm gonna need more.

01:18:46.597 --> 01:18:48.679
The drive was originally
only on a 10 year lock

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:50.764
with only the president
having access to it.

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:52.049
As of this morning,

01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:54.718
all of those encrypted
passwords unlocked.

01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:56.082
Hence why everybody's
being let out.

01:18:56.106 --> 01:18:57.687
They really want that drive.

01:18:57.691 --> 01:18:58.691
Who had them?

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.645
Just the president and the NSA.

01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:02.059
One went missing.

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:03.318
What happened to it?

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:04.695
Don't worry about it, I got it.

01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:05.687
Who's looking for it?

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:06.609
Good question.

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:07.990
Nobody knows.

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:10.242
Whoever was looking for it
then is looking for it now.

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:11.697
Well now it all makes sense.

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:13.585
Lock up everyone involved
for the last 10 years,

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:15.060
flesh out the drive and
when the drive unlocks...

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:15.948
Boom.

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:17.537
And our mission from before,

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.417
following the secret
area of the government

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:22.000
until the drive
services and if it does,

01:19:22.049 --> 01:19:24.631
get it, capture it,
hold it privately

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:26.463
and wait for further
instructions.

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:27.718
How did you get it?

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:29.632
I was trailing an
FBI agent named kline.

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:31.013
I intercepted a call.

01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:32.798
Someone telling him
to drop the file off

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:34.432
at a remote location.

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:36.719
Apparently he wasn't the
only one that got that call.

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.311
I show up, kline's dead.

01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:40.769
Drives still on him,
completely untouched.

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:42.103
Does anyone know you have it?

01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:43.152
It don't know

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:44.901
but somebody knows something

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:45.947
and they need it.

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:47.446
We need to find out who.

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:48.901
We need to find out why.

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:52.819
We need to find them
before they find us.

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:55.283
Hey, Ryan, wait for me
in the barn out back.

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:58.324
There's somebody I
gotta meet first.

01:20:09.179 --> 01:20:10.134
Cap, what do we got?

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.044
He's at the pig farm.

01:20:11.098 --> 01:20:12.008
Put a trace on his phone.

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:14.389
All right, I'm on my way.

01:20:53.766 --> 01:20:54.766
Chief!

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:39.602
Chief!

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:09.879
Chief!

01:22:09.883 --> 01:22:11.874
Up here, Doug.

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:16.799
Chief!

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:18.760
Where is it, Doug?

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:19.673
What?

01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:22.012
The drive, where's the drive?!

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:23.268
Chief, what's this about?

01:22:23.313 --> 01:22:24.874
It's what this whole
thing's all about!

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:26.854
Just give them what they want!

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.515
Chief, I don't have it.

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:32.360
Hello, officer.

01:22:35.325 --> 01:22:36.906
So you're behind this?

01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:37.910
Sort of.

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:43.893
You think I could've gotten
all of those prisoners

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.157
out on my own?

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.996
Where's the drive, Doug?!

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:48.626
T don't have it.

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:49.672
You sure?

01:22:50.757 --> 01:22:53.874
He doesn't know
anything, let him go.

01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:56.172
Okay.

01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:57.381
Don't do it.

01:22:58.932 --> 01:22:59.932
Don't do it!

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:02.132
Okay.

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:03.301
Don't.

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:13.940
So I take you read the note
I left on Robert Clayton?

01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:17.777
Calling your friends, Doug?

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:18.826
Good.

01:23:20.954 --> 01:23:23.070
I'll be certain to call
Amy when all this is done.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:25.455
She'll need a great
psychologist to talk to

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:28.243
about her soon-to-be-dead
boyfriend.

01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:31.412
You touch her, I swear to god

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:33.330
I'll rip your throat out.

01:23:34.968 --> 01:23:36.174
Wow.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.220
Romantic.

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:41.756
Sounds to me like you
should put out or shut up!

01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:43.969
Why do you want it?

01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:47.310
You still don't know.

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:48.971
Listen,

01:23:48.982 --> 01:23:51.519
I'm just trying to solve
a few murders, huh?

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:53.650
Do you wanna help me out?

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.862
Why don't we make a deal?

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:02.488
Back up.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:03.653
Listen.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:04.911
Turn around.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.456
Let's make a deal.

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:14.505
You stop trying to kill me
and you let everyone else go

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:16.541
that you planned on killing

01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:18.925
and I'll get you the drive.

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:22.136
Il can get it.

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:24.013
You got three hours!

01:24:25.185 --> 01:24:29.019
Meet me at the north
side prison back gate.

01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:30.432
You got that?!

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:32.018
Yeah, all right.

01:24:35.112 --> 01:24:36.818
And Doug?

01:24:36.863 --> 01:24:39.024
Don't bring any of your friends.

01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:41.569
It will only complicate
things for you.

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:28.404
What happened to you?

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:29.993
Woo!

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:34.126
I had a scheduled meeting
with a psychologist.

01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:36.207
Those guys really mess
up your head, don't they?

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:37.792
You all right?

01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:38.841
Yeah.

01:25:39.885 --> 01:25:41.716
Your partner says
hello, by the way.

01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:43.127
And don't bring any cops

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.263
and we have three hours
to turn in the drive.

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:47.764
Wait, wait, okay.

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:50.050
Where are we going
to finish this?

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:51.138
Some place gorgeous,

01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:52.724
like a prison

01:25:52.773 --> 01:25:53.773
at night.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:55.483
Alone.

01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:59.393
Are you gonna change or
are you gonna go like that?

01:25:59.446 --> 01:26:00.590
What do you mean,
these are my clothes.

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:02.104
Change into what?

01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:03.150
Good point, okay.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.260
Good talk, you're driving.

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:05.284
It knew it.

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:11.743
You know,

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:13.783
it's too bad we have to leave.

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:15.120
You really know how to live.

01:26:15.128 --> 01:26:16.481
Oh, thanks Doug,
I appreciate it.

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:18.166
It's super cozy here.

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:19.830
I was kidding.

01:26:19.883 --> 01:26:21.089
Ryan, where's the drive?

01:26:21.134 --> 01:26:22.499
I have the drive, it's safe.

01:26:22.552 --> 01:26:23.667
Come on, we gotta go.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.927
Give me the drive, Ryan.

01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:29.141
Here.

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:34.140
Have you seen what's on this?

01:26:34.147 --> 01:26:35.432
No.

01:26:35.482 --> 01:26:36.668
Ryan, get out of the
car an open the doors,

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:37.431
we can't get out.

01:26:37.484 --> 01:26:38.484
Got it.

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:45.241
Amazing.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:01.956
All right, let's see
what this is all about.

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.265
"Classified operation, y2k.

01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:14.175
"December 31st,

01:27:14.187 --> 01:27:15.187
"19090.

01:27:16.148 --> 01:27:18.184
"National security agency.â

01:27:18.191 --> 01:27:20.682
Scroll down.

01:27:28.201 --> 01:27:29.111
It's encrypted.

01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:30.161
Move.

01:27:32.038 --> 01:27:33.403
This is what I do.

01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:42.670
Oh my god.

01:27:42.716 --> 01:27:44.206
What?

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:47.209
This isn't just military
locations and launch codes,

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.757
man, this is us treasury access.

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:51.284
So you didn't know about this?

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:52.969
No.

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:54.224
Is the other drive
the same thing?

01:27:54.227 --> 01:27:55.342
It should be.

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:57.218
We gotta go.

01:27:57.230 --> 01:27:58.230
Mhmm.

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:14.444
Ryan, I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

01:28:14.498 --> 01:28:16.034
What happened the
night you took this?

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:16.946
I already told you, man!

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.490
I was ordered to follow kline.

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:20.534
That call I intercepted,
simple transfer.

01:28:20.587 --> 01:28:21.952
Data for payment.

01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:24.587
I have no idea who
killed the guy.

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:26.669
So the question
is, who killed kline

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:27.987
and why didn't they
take this drive?

01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:29.011
Sure.

01:28:30.514 --> 01:28:33.756
All right, we gotta split up.

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:36.346
All right, I'll cover
you from the roof.

01:28:36.394 --> 01:28:37.258
Can't wait to see what happens

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:38.597
when they find me with this.

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:39.511
I'd hate to see
what would happen

01:28:39.564 --> 01:28:42.647
if they found you with nothing.

01:29:15.225 --> 01:29:16.225
Detective!

01:29:22.482 --> 01:29:24.814
I thought we agreed, no friend.

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.396
No friends.

01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:28.309
What do you think, I'm stupid?

01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:29.363
Hmmm?

01:29:33.326 --> 01:29:35.317
Well, did you bring it?

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:40.541
This?

01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:43.291
I just got one question.

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:45.793
Which one do you think it is?

01:29:45.839 --> 01:29:48.330
The drive that's not
only gonna save your life

01:29:48.341 --> 01:29:50.457
but your brother's as well.

01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:52.595
Speaking of,

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:55.671
where is your brother?

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:57.589
He wanted me to tell you hello

01:29:57.642 --> 01:30:00.179
and he couldn't make it.

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:03.345
Said he didn't want
to be underdressed.

01:30:08.528 --> 01:30:10.940
The drive for his freedom.

01:30:12.616 --> 01:30:14.402
What happened, fellas?

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:17.363
Late for your pickup
on new year's?

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:21.245
I got it right here.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:23.740
It's over

01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:25.124
we're done.

01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:26.535
It's never over!

01:30:37.515 --> 01:30:38.925
Check the drive.

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:49.687
You're not gonna get
away with any of this.

01:30:49.736 --> 01:30:50.771
What's really on it?

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:52.151
What's in it for you?

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:55.405
Oh, you're gonna
see what's on it.

01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:56.488
Will we?

01:30:56.534 --> 01:30:58.616
Everybody was wondering,
who was that guy?

01:30:58.662 --> 01:31:00.869
Who was killing
people around my town?

01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:02.779
We haven't had one problem here.

01:31:02.832 --> 01:31:04.447
The drive's blank!

01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:27.433
It should've been a dentist.

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:50.084
You all right?

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:51.836
No, cap, I'm not all right.

01:31:51.881 --> 01:31:53.462
What took you guys so long?

01:31:53.466 --> 01:31:55.457
Sorry, the road were icy.

01:31:57.721 --> 01:31:59.177
I ook at this.

01:31:59.222 --> 01:32:00.462
Northside correctional,

01:32:00.473 --> 01:32:02.714
a privately funded
ex-military prison,

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:06.134
houses some of the most
deadly ex-military personnel.

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:08.394
It is believed that the
cause of the recent attacks

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.725
on this small sleepy town

01:32:09.774 --> 01:32:13.016
was over a missing drive
from the y2k scare.

01:32:13.069 --> 01:32:15.606
This drive is
believed to be a hoax.

01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:16.485
Really?

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:18.522
The roads were icy?

01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:21.317
Well, that's why it
took so long to get here.

01:32:22.495 --> 01:32:23.655
You know, we wanna just

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:26.196
make sure our response time

01:32:26.249 --> 01:32:27.329
is solid.

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:28.490
I guess it wouldn't be goffstown

01:32:28.501 --> 01:32:30.833
if you weren't a couple
minutes late, right?

01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:32.494
Hey, cap!

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:33.836
Happy new year!

01:32:55.737 --> 01:32:56.737

01:32:58.865 --> 01:32:59.865
