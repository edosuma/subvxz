00:02.999 --> 00:04.998
# We're not going out

00:04.999 --> 00:06.998
# Not staying in

00:06.999 --> 00:09.998
# Just hanging around
With my head in a spin

00:09.999 --> 00:11.998
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

00:11.999 --> 00:15.998
# We're not going out

00:15.999 --> 00:18.999
# We are not going out. #

00:21.426 --> 00:24.226
<font color="#FFFF00"> We had some very good news
this week.</font>

00:24.227 --> 00:26.425
<font color="#FFFF00"> Jack's school came top of
the league tables.</font>

00:26.426 --> 00:30.425
<font color="#00FFFF"> Charlie's school's in the relegation
play-offs with Rochdale.</font>

00:30.426 --> 00:32.424
Not this again - his school is fine.

00:32.426 --> 00:34.425
<font color="#00FFFF"> That's not what Ofsted said.</font>

00:34.426 --> 00:36.425
<font color="#00FFFF"> There's a rumour going
around the playground</font>

00:36.426 --> 00:38.425
<font color="#00FFFF"> they're about to downgrade
the rating</font>

00:38.426 --> 00:40.425
<font color="#00FFFF"> from "good" to
"requires improvement".</font>

00:40.426 --> 00:42.426
<font color="#FFFF00"> Lucy, I'm so sorry!</font>

00:43.426 --> 00:46.399
<font color="#FFFF00"> You never think it will happen
to someone you know.</font>

00:47.120 --> 00:52.150
<font color="#11FF11"> That is genuinely a bigger reaction
than you had when my mother died.</font>

00:52.152 --> 00:54.830
<font color="#11FF11"> I get very confused by all this
Ofsted stuff</font>

00:54.831 --> 00:57.311
<font color="#11FF11"> since they changed the ratings -
didn't "requires improvement"</font>

00:57.312 --> 00:59.830
<font color="#11FF11"> used to be "satisfactory"?</font>

00:59.831 --> 01:01.831
<font color="#FFFF00"> You're thinking of the bedroom.</font>

01:02.831 --> 01:05.830
He's right. And if the school
is satisfactory, it's good.

01:05.831 --> 01:08.830
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, Lee - outstanding
would have been good.</font>

01:08.831 --> 01:10.830
<font color="#00FFFF"> Good would have been acceptable
and satisfactory</font>

01:10.831 --> 01:13.831
<font color="#00FFFF"> would have been... unsatisfactory.</font>

01:14.831 --> 01:17.991
<font color="#11FF11"> And yet I still find it confusing.</font>

01:17.992 --> 01:19.831
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, these ratings are very
important.</font>

01:19.832 --> 01:23.830
<font color="#FFFF00"> None of us would eat in a place
whose hygiene was only satisfactory.</font>

01:23.831 --> 01:25.831
Yes, we would. In fact, you are.

01:27.831 --> 01:29.631
<font color="#00FFFF"> If his school requires improvement,</font>

01:29.632 --> 01:31.830
<font color="#00FFFF"> it makes me want to pull Charlie
out of there.</font>

01:31.831 --> 01:34.830
I'm sure that wouldn't improve
the school that much.

01:34.831 --> 01:37.830
<font color="#00FFFF"> As you can see, Lee doesn't take
this very seriously.</font>

01:37.831 --> 01:39.830
No, I just don't care what a load
of inspectors say.

01:39.831 --> 01:42.830
I base my own opinions on
my own experiences

01:42.831 --> 01:43.831
of being at the school.

01:43.832 --> 01:45.830
<font color="#00FFFF"> And what experiences are they?</font>

01:45.831 --> 01:49.830
Someone's forgetting that hour I did
on the Hook A Duck stall.

01:49.831 --> 01:51.830
<font color="#00FFFF"> I have my own opinions,
as well you know.</font>

01:51.831 --> 01:54.830
<font color="#00FFFF"> I don't need some officious body
telling me what to think.</font>

01:54.831 --> 01:55.831
<font color="#11FF11"> Neither do I.</font>

01:55.832 --> 01:58.831
<font color="#11FF11"> But we all have to play
with the hand we're dealt.</font>

02:01.831 --> 02:03.830
<font color="#FFFF00"> Have you thought about moving
to a different area?</font>

02:03.831 --> 02:06.831
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
Charlie would find us.

02:06.832 --> 02:09.830
<font color="#FFFF00"> Have you considered sending him
to private school,</font>

02:09.830 --> 02:10.830
<font color="#FFFF00"> like we have with Jack?</font>

02:10.832 --> 02:12.991
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, we can't afford it.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, right. Sorry.</font>

02:12.992 --> 02:14.830
Well, hang on -

02:14.831 --> 02:16.830
the fact that we wouldn't send him
to a private school

02:16.831 --> 02:17.831
is not about the money.

02:17.832 --> 02:19.830
<font color="#11FF11"> Yeah, private isn't the only option.</font>

02:19.831 --> 02:22.791
<font color="#11FF11"> There are lots of great
state schools. I went to one.</font>

02:22.792 --> 02:23.830
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Well, a grammar. </font>Yes.</font>

02:23.831 --> 02:26.830
<font color="#FFFF00"> But you'd have also thrived
in the private system.</font>

02:26.831 --> 02:30.830
<font color="#FFFF00"> Given the chance, you could
have achieved something.</font>

02:30.831 --> 02:32.832
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm a hospital consultant
and surgeon.</font>

02:34.831 --> 02:36.832
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yes, but for bottoms or something.</font>

02:38.831 --> 02:42.831
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, Lee - are you opposed
to private school?</font>

02:44.831 --> 02:46.830
<font color="#11FF11"> It's OK, you don't have to have
the same opinion as Anna.</font>

02:46.831 --> 02:48.631
<font color="#11FF11"> I do. Obviously.</font>

02:48.632 --> 02:50.831
<font color="#11FF11"> I promised to love, honour
and agree.</font>

02:52.831 --> 02:54.830
Well, seeing as you ask, yes,
I am opposed to them.

02:54.831 --> 02:57.329
And don't even get me started
on the hats.

02:57.331 --> 02:58.938
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, let's all agree to disagree.</font>

02:58.940 --> 03:00.424
<font color="#11FF11"> All schools have their merits.</font>

03:00.426 --> 03:02.778
<font color="#00FFFF"> Exactly. Look at us lot.</font>

03:02.779 --> 03:05.778
<font color="#00FFFF"> Anna went to boarding school.
Toby went to a grammar school.</font>

03:05.779 --> 03:07.778
<font color="#00FFFF"> I went to a very nice comprehensive.</font>

03:07.779 --> 03:10.778
<font color="#00FFFF"> And Lee went to a school
that was eventually burnt down</font>

03:10.779 --> 03:13.778
<font color="#00FFFF"> by an alcoholic PE teacher
with a grudge.</font>

03:13.779 --> 03:14.939
<font color="#00FFFF"> And we all turned out OK!</font>

03:14.940 --> 03:17.778
<font color="#FFFF00"> Without a doubt. Procul dubio.</font>

03:17.779 --> 03:19.778
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Indubitably. </font>Exactly.</font>

03:19.779 --> 03:21.779
Fo' shizzle.

03:25.779 --> 03:28.778
<font color="#00FFFF"> I've been thinking about
what we discussed last night.</font>

03:28.779 --> 03:31.419
Oh, don't worry - I've come round
to your way of thinking.

03:31.420 --> 03:35.778
You're right - we're not at home
enough to get a pet monkey.

03:35.779 --> 03:36.779
<font color="#00FFFF"> I mean during dinner.</font>

03:36.780 --> 03:39.778
<font color="#00FFFF"> You know, when Anna suggested
we think about private education</font>

03:39.779 --> 03:41.260
<font color="#00FFFF"> for Charlie.</font>

03:43.779 --> 03:45.778
<font color="#00FFFF"> You're not serious?</font>
I think we could afford it</font>

03:45.779 --> 03:47.259
<font color="#00FFFF"> if we made a couple of sacrifices.</font>

03:47.260 --> 03:48.779
We can't do that to the twins.

03:51.779 --> 03:54.778
I told you last night, it's not
about the money, it's the principle.

03:54.779 --> 03:57.579
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, my mum and dad think
we should consider it.</font>

03:57.580 --> 03:59.778
Oh, sorry - you've been discussing
it with your mum and dad

03:59.779 --> 04:01.778
before you discussed it with
your husband?

04:01.779 --> 04:03.778
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, they're a bit more open minded
than you.</font>

04:03.779 --> 04:04.779
Open minded? Your dad?

04:04.780 --> 04:07.778
The man whose main reason
for voting for Brexit

04:07.779 --> 04:10.778
was because he saw a tin
of sauerkraut in Asda?

04:10.779 --> 04:12.778
We are not sending Charlie
to a private school.

04:12.779 --> 04:14.779
<font color="#00FFFF"> KNOCK AT DOOR</font>
Oh...</font>

04:15.779 --> 04:17.778
Oh, Dad, I wasn't expecting you.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.778
<font color="#FFFF00"> I thought I'd surprise you.</font>

04:19.779 --> 04:20.779
<font color="#FFFF00"> And I need to borrow 20 quid.</font>

04:20.779 --> 04:22.780
Well, then you haven't surprised me.

04:24.779 --> 04:26.778
<font color="#FFFF00"> The machine won't give me any money.</font>

04:26.779 --> 04:30.497
Yeah, well, you should tried nudging
on two bells and a cherry.

04:30.499 --> 04:33.197
<font color="#FFFF00"> Thanks, son. You'll get it back
in a few days.</font>

04:33.199 --> 04:35.999
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm not going to disappear out
of the country for sake of 20 quid.</font>

04:36.000 --> 04:39.198
Just out of interest, how much
would that cost me?

04:39.199 --> 04:41.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Are you all right, son?</font>

04:41.199 --> 04:44.198
Yeah, sorry, you just caught me
having a bit of a disagreement

04:44.199 --> 04:46.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> with Lucy, that's all. </font>About what?</font>

04:46.199 --> 04:48.198
Well, if you must know, about
the idea of sending Charlie

04:48.199 --> 04:50.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> to a private school. </font>You what?</font>

04:50.199 --> 04:53.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> Are you trying to turn him into
Tarquin the tosspot?</font>

04:55.200 --> 04:57.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> I didn't raise you...</font>

04:57.199 --> 04:59.999
You can probably end
that sentence there.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> There's no grandson of mine
going to private school.</font>

05:02.199 --> 05:05.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Um, I think that's a decision
Lee and I should be making, Frank.</font>

05:05.199 --> 05:08.359
Er, well, hang on - if your parents
can weigh in, so can mine.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.198
Carry on, Dad. Say your piece.

05:10.199 --> 05:13.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> State education made me
the man I am today.</font>

05:13.199 --> 05:14.199
Perhaps leave it there.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.199
KNOCK AT DOOR

05:20.199 --> 05:21.839
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, hello.</font>

05:21.840 --> 05:23.839
<font color="#11FF11"> Sorry to just land on you like this.</font>

05:23.840 --> 05:25.839
<font color="#11FF11"> There's something we wanted
to discuss,</font>

05:25.840 --> 05:28.198
<font color="#11FF11"> but we didn't realise Frank
would be here.</font>

05:28.199 --> 05:31.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why does nobody want to talk
in front of me today?</font>

05:31.199 --> 05:33.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm not a police informant,
you know.</font>

05:33.199 --> 05:38.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> There must be some reason they
allow you to remain at large.</font>

05:38.199 --> 05:39.679
<font color="#11FF11"> All right, I'll just say it.</font>

05:39.680 --> 05:42.198
<font color="#11FF11"> It's about Charlie's failing school.</font>

05:42.199 --> 05:45.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> We think you should consider
a private school for Charlie.</font>

05:45.199 --> 05:47.198
Yeah, so I've heard.

05:47.199 --> 05:49.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's immoral and I'm opposed to it.</font>

05:49.199 --> 05:50.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> What, private education?</font>

05:50.200 --> 05:53.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Or the concept of education
in general?</font>

05:53.200 --> 05:56.198
Listen, my dad can be quite
irritating at times

05:56.199 --> 05:59.198
and often operates with a very
suspect moral compass.

05:59.199 --> 06:02.840
But on this one, very isolated case,
he happens to have a point.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Thanks, son.</font>

06:07.199 --> 06:08.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> That means a lot to me.</font>

06:11.199 --> 06:14.198
Under no circumstances are we
sending Charlie to a private school.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, hear us out.</font>

06:15.200 --> 06:18.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Wendy and I would like
to pay for it.</font>

06:19.199 --> 06:22.198
Well, I suppose there's
two sides to every argument.

06:22.199 --> 06:26.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Wow. I'm assuming your march
from Jarrow is off?</font>

06:26.200 --> 06:29.839
<font color="#11FF11"> And we'll pay for Benji and Molly
too if, when the time comes,</font>

06:29.840 --> 06:33.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Charlie's school still hasn't
got his act together.</font>

06:33.199 --> 06:35.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, I don't know what to say.</font>

06:35.200 --> 06:37.159
<font color="#00FFFF"> Thank you.</font>

06:37.160 --> 06:38.199
Yeah, that's... very generous.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> Unbelievable.</font>

06:41.199 --> 06:43.198
Well, they're offering to pay.

06:43.199 --> 06:44.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> You said money didn't come into it.</font>

06:44.200 --> 06:48.198
Which it won't if they're
offering to pay!

06:48.199 --> 06:50.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> Am I the only one here
with any convictions?</font>

06:50.360 --> 06:54.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> You're making this far too easy
for me, Frank.</font>

06:54.199 --> 06:56.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, I've said my piece.</font>

06:56.199 --> 06:58.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> There's some people have
to work hard in life,</font>

06:58.199 --> 07:01.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> whereas other people just expect
things to be handed to them.</font>

07:03.199 --> 07:04.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> Can I have that 20 quid?</font>

07:06.000 --> 07:12.074

07:13.840 --> 07:16.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Thanks for the tour, Lucas.
It looks like a fantastic school.</font>

07:16.200 --> 07:18.159
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, it is, yes.</font>

07:18.160 --> 07:20.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Our exam results are amongst
the finest in the country.</font>

07:20.199 --> 07:22.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> And there's loads of
different clubs to join.</font>

07:22.199 --> 07:24.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm actually President
of the Debating Society.</font>

07:24.199 --> 07:26.519
<font color="#FFFF00"> What's that? </font>Well, you compete
to win an argument.</font>

07:26.520 --> 07:29.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> It doesn't matter whether you
believe in your position or not,</font>

07:29.199 --> 07:32.198
just as long as it's the opposite
of your adversary. <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#FFFF00"> See?</font>

07:32.199 --> 07:35.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> They even prepare them
for being married.</font>

07:35.199 --> 07:37.198
Is there anything else I can
help you with. <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#FFFF00"> No.</font>

07:37.199 --> 07:40.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> I think we've pretty much
covered everything.</font>

07:40.199 --> 07:43.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> The multimedia centre, the hockey
pitches, the five-floor library,</font>

07:43.199 --> 07:45.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> the swimming pool.</font>

07:45.199 --> 07:48.198
When do we get to go on
the flight simulator?

07:48.199 --> 07:51.999
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, my God, there's an actual
flight simulator!</font>

07:52.000 --> 07:54.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, if you'll excuse me,
I've got Bible study.</font>

07:54.199 --> 07:56.198
I can't imagine Charlie
choosing that club.

07:56.199 --> 07:58.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> That one's compulsory.</font>

07:58.199 --> 07:59.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> This is a faith based school.</font>

07:59.200 --> 08:01.199
Faith based?

08:01.200 --> 08:05.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> You mean it's... religious? </font>No.
He means they built the curriculum</font>

08:05.199 --> 08:07.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> around George Michael's
back catalogue.</font>

08:07.199 --> 08:08.359
BELL RINGS

08:08.360 --> 08:11.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'd better not be late.
We're doing Ephesians 6.</font>

08:11.199 --> 08:15.198
I've not even seen
Ephesians 1 to 5.

08:15.199 --> 08:16.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> I do hope I've been of help.</font>

08:16.200 --> 08:18.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, you have, Lucas. Thank you.</font>

08:21.199 --> 08:24.198
Whatever happened to alcopops
and shoplifting?

08:24.199 --> 08:25.839
<font color="#00FFFF"> What do you think?</font>

08:25.840 --> 08:29.198
My guess is some sort of weird adult
pretending to be a boy.

08:29.199 --> 08:31.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> I mean about the school.</font>

08:31.199 --> 08:32.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Isn't it amazing?</font>

08:32.200 --> 08:34.198
Yeah, but it's... it's religious.

08:34.198 --> 08:37.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> So? Or do you object to faith
schools as well as private schools?</font>

08:37.198 --> 08:39.198
Of course not.

08:39.198 --> 08:40.198
But they might object to us.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.679
<font color="#00FFFF"> It'll be fine. If anyone asks us,
we'll just say</font>

08:42.679 --> 08:45.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> we're a bit more God-y
than we actually are.</font>

08:45.199 --> 08:47.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's not like all the teachers
are priests.</font>

08:47.199 --> 08:50.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Hello! Miss Jenkins, headmistress.</font>

08:50.199 --> 08:52.198
<font color="#11FF11"> You must be Lucy and Lee.</font>

08:52.199 --> 08:54.199
And also... with you.

09:03.199 --> 09:04.199
<font color="#11FF11"> Thank you for coming in.</font>

09:04.200 --> 09:06.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, thank you for
sparing us the time.</font>

09:06.199 --> 09:08.198
Yes, very good of you, Father.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.199
I mean...

09:09.200 --> 09:11.198
It's not Mother, is it?

09:11.199 --> 09:13.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Miss Jenkins is fine.</font>

09:13.199 --> 09:16.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Please don't be nervous. It's just
an informal chat, few questions.</font>

09:16.199 --> 09:17.199
Fire away.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.198
If you want me to name all 14
disciples, just say the word.

09:21.199 --> 09:23.198
It's just a joke.
I know there was 12.

09:23.199 --> 09:27.198
Oh, you know, if we're including
the one we don't talk about.

09:27.199 --> 09:31.198
You know, kissy, kissy,
catchy, catchy.

09:31.199 --> 09:34.198
<font color="#11FF11"> I simply want to know a bit
more about you and Charlie.</font>

09:34.199 --> 09:36.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Which church do you
currently attend?</font>

09:36.199 --> 09:39.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> St Mary's. </font>St Peter's.</font>

09:39.199 --> 09:42.198
St Peter, Paul and Mary's.

09:42.199 --> 09:44.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> He means All Saints.</font>

09:44.199 --> 09:47.198
Peter, Paul and Mary weren't
in All Saints.

09:47.199 --> 09:50.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Not the band. The church.</font>

09:50.199 --> 09:52.198
Oh, right.

09:52.199 --> 09:55.198
Never, ever have I ever felt so low.

09:55.199 --> 09:58.198
When you going to get me out of
this black hole?

09:58.199 --> 10:01.198
You know, the All Saints song.

10:01.199 --> 10:03.198
I like, er, I like other stuff too.

10:03.199 --> 10:04.199
Like, um...

10:06.199 --> 10:08.198
..Hymns.

10:08.199 --> 10:12.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> We don't actually have a specific
church yet, as we recently moved.</font>

10:12.199 --> 10:14.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> So, we've been trying out
a few different ones.</font>

10:14.360 --> 10:18.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> You know - try before you... die.</font>

10:18.199 --> 10:21.679
<font color="#11FF11"> So, is Charlie's current school
a faith school?</font>

10:21.680 --> 10:25.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> No. More of a lack of faith school.</font>

10:25.199 --> 10:27.519
<font color="#00FFFF"> Specifically my lack of faith
that it's any good.</font>

10:27.520 --> 10:29.198
She's worried about a dodgy Ofsted.

10:29.199 --> 10:31.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's not about Ofsted.</font>

10:31.200 --> 10:33.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's what I think.</font>

10:33.199 --> 10:35.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Lucysted.</font>

10:35.199 --> 10:37.198
Good job your name's not Stan.

10:37.199 --> 10:43.199
<font color="#11FF11"> Right. Not currently attending
a faith school...</font>

10:43.200 --> 10:48.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yes, but we take it upon ourselves
to talk to the kids about...</font>

10:48.199 --> 10:49.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..you know...</font>

10:49.360 --> 10:52.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..Jesus.</font>

10:52.199 --> 10:53.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Don't we, Lee?</font>

10:53.200 --> 10:56.198
Well, his name certainly
comes up a lot.

10:56.199 --> 10:59.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, I'll need a few extra details
while you're here.</font>

10:59.199 --> 11:02.198
<font color="#11FF11"> For example, the date and location
of Charlie's christening?</font>

11:02.199 --> 11:04.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yup.</font>

11:04.199 --> 11:06.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> So, just to confirm, you need...?</font>

11:06.199 --> 11:08.359
<font color="#11FF11"> I need to know where the christening
took place.</font>

11:08.360 --> 11:10.199
At the front in that birdbath thing.

11:12.199 --> 11:16.999
<font color="#11FF11"> Erm, Charlie has actually
been christened, I assume?</font>

11:17.000 --> 11:20.999
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, that sort of depends
on how you define christened.</font>

11:21.000 --> 11:23.198
<font color="#11FF11"> I mean, has he been christened?</font>

11:23.199 --> 11:25.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh. In that case...</font>

11:25.199 --> 11:27.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..no.</font>

11:27.199 --> 11:29.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Right.</font>

11:29.199 --> 11:32.198
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm sorry, but the thing is,
if he hasn't been christened...</font>

11:32.199 --> 11:35.159
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, but that's a very good reason
why he hasn't been christened.</font>

11:35.160 --> 11:37.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> And that is, um...</font>

11:37.199 --> 11:40.159
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..as follows.</font>

11:40.160 --> 11:42.519
<font color="#00FFFF"> We... didn't used to be
that religious.</font>

11:42.520 --> 11:46.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Lee and I have only come to
our faith relatively recently.</font>

11:46.199 --> 11:48.200
<font color="#11FF11">How recently? </font>About...
<font color="#FFFF00"> Three years ago.</font>

11:50.199 --> 11:52.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Back when Charlie was born,
we didn't get him christened</font>

11:52.199 --> 11:55.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> because we hadn't properly
found our faith.</font>

11:55.199 --> 11:57.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> But as time passes, we're becoming
more and more committed,</font>

11:57.199 --> 11:59.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> aren't we, Lee? </font>By the minute.

11:59.199 --> 12:02.198
At this rate, by lunchtime,
she'll be the Pope.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.159
<font color="#11FF11"> Same thing goes for you, does it?</font>

12:04.160 --> 12:06.198
Yes, I certainly feel I'm getting in
a lot deeper

12:06.199 --> 12:08.198
than I was to begin with.

12:08.199 --> 12:10.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> We're going to make a lot
of changes.</font>

12:10.199 --> 12:12.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> One of them is to find Charlie
a faith school</font>

12:12.199 --> 12:14.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> and another is to get him
christened,</font>

12:14.199 --> 12:17.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> which we are going to do
very, very soon.</font>

12:17.199 --> 12:20.679
<font color="#11FF11"> Of course, I'll need to see
the certificate of baptism</font>

12:20.680 --> 12:22.198
<font color="#11FF11"> when it's done.</font>

12:22.199 --> 12:24.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Where are you getting it done?</font>

12:24.199 --> 12:25.999
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, that's the thing.</font>

12:26.000 --> 12:28.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> You see, everything's pretty much
booked up at the moment.</font>

12:28.199 --> 12:31.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> So, we, um, we don't actually have
a place as yet.</font>

12:31.199 --> 12:33.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> It could end up being done anywhere.</font>

12:33.199 --> 12:36.198
But that's all right, yeah, with
the whole omnipresence thing?

12:36.199 --> 12:39.198
Could end up being in the bathroom
department at Wickes.

12:39.199 --> 12:42.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, this is a predicament
I might be able to solve.</font>

12:42.199 --> 12:44.198
<font color="#11FF11"> I'd be very happy to baptize
Charlie myself.</font>

12:44.199 --> 12:45.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Right.</font>

12:45.200 --> 12:47.198
<font color="#11FF11"> If you're agreeable to it.</font>

12:47.199 --> 12:49.159
<font color="#00FFFF"> Of course.</font>

12:49.160 --> 12:52.159
<font color="#11FF11"> How's Sunday? </font>Well, actually,
I'm meant to be playing football.

12:52.160 --> 12:56.198
But I can't play this Sunday because
I'm having my son christened.

12:56.199 --> 12:58.679
<font color="#00FFFF"> That would be wonderful.
Thank you very much.</font>

12:58.680 --> 13:00.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Right, now - godparents?</font>

13:00.199 --> 13:02.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, God... parents.</font>

13:02.199 --> 13:04.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yes. Um...</font>

13:04.199 --> 13:06.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> What about them? </font>I look
forward to meeting them.</font>

13:06.360 --> 13:08.198
So do I.

13:08.199 --> 13:12.839
<font color="#11FF11">Can I have their details?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah. Their names are...</font>

13:12.840 --> 13:15.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..Anna and Toby.</font>

13:15.199 --> 13:18.359
<font color="#11FF11"> Are they relatives? </font>I hope not,
they're married to each other!

13:18.360 --> 13:20.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> They're our friends. </font>Good friends?</font>

13:20.199 --> 13:21.520
<font color="#00FFFF"> We'll see.</font>

13:29.199 --> 13:31.198
Are you sure Toby and Anna
will agree to this?

13:31.199 --> 13:33.198
It's very dishonest and cynical.

13:33.199 --> 13:34.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Exactly.</font>

13:34.200 --> 13:36.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> They're the perfect people to ask.</font>

13:36.199 --> 13:39.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> They'll understand. </font>Why don't we
just ask your parents?

13:39.199 --> 13:41.519
They're the ones that want Charlie
to go to a private school.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> They wouldn't approve of this.</font>

13:43.199 --> 13:45.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> You know what Dad's like
about honesty.</font>

13:45.199 --> 13:48.198
That's true. He doesn't even cheat
at the self-service checkout

13:48.199 --> 13:50.199
by weighing mangoes as potatoes.

13:53.199 --> 13:56.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, come on, Lucy,
don't leave us on tenterhooks.</font>

13:56.199 --> 13:57.839
<font color="#FFFF00"> What did you want
to talk to us about?</font>

13:57.840 --> 14:00.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, actually, it's a bit of
a cheeky request,</font>

14:00.199 --> 14:04.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> so please feel free to say no if
you feel uncomfortable with it.</font>

14:04.199 --> 14:07.198
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm starting to think this is
about swapping partners.</font>

14:07.199 --> 14:09.198
We're going to need
a safe word, Anna.

14:09.199 --> 14:11.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> I've got one. Goodbye.</font>

14:12.199 --> 14:14.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> We're getting Charlie christened.</font>

14:14.199 --> 14:16.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, isn't he christened already?</font>

14:16.200 --> 14:18.159
<font color="#00FFFF"> No.</font>

14:18.160 --> 14:21.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> We thought we'd wait
until he could swim.</font>

14:21.199 --> 14:23.159
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, we didn't get any of
the kids done.</font>

14:23.160 --> 14:24.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Wasn't really our sort of thing.</font>

14:24.199 --> 14:27.198
We have considered exorcism
a few times.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> That's quite unusual, isn't it,
to do it at this age?</font>

14:29.199 --> 14:31.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yes, it is. But there's actually
a very good reason</font>

14:31.200 --> 14:34.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> we're getting him christened
and a reason we're asking you</font>

14:34.199 --> 14:38.198
to be godparents, because basically,
my... <font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Asking us to be godparents?</font>

14:38.199 --> 14:40.839
That's right. You see, the thing
is... <font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Of course we'll do it,</font>

14:40.840 --> 14:43.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> won't we, Toby? Oh!</font>

14:44.199 --> 14:45.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, ha...</font>

14:45.200 --> 14:48.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Right. You know, just to be clear...</font>

14:48.199 --> 14:50.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Hang on, are you crying?</font>

14:50.199 --> 14:53.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, I'm sorry.
I feel a bit emotional.</font>

14:53.199 --> 14:55.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> This is my first time.</font>

14:55.199 --> 15:00.159
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Really? </font>It's true. Anna's never
felt emotions before.</font>

15:00.160 --> 15:02.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> We've never been asked
to be godparents before.</font>

15:02.199 --> 15:04.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> I feel like I've been
to 100 christenings,</font>

15:04.200 --> 15:07.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> but we were always the bridesmaids.</font>

15:07.199 --> 15:10.199
There is a possibility they weren't
actually christenings.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.999
<font color="#FFFF00"> I was starting to wonder
if it was me.</font>

15:13.000 --> 15:16.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> You know, maybe people didn't really
see me as godparent material,</font>

15:16.199 --> 15:18.679
<font color="#FFFF00"> maybe even a little... cynical.</font>

15:18.680 --> 15:20.359
BOTH: No...

15:20.360 --> 15:24.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> I can't tell you what this means
to me, Lucy. I am... really,</font>

15:24.199 --> 15:27.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> really honoured and touched.</font>

15:27.199 --> 15:31.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Can I ask you
what made you choose us?</font>

15:31.199 --> 15:34.679
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, to be honest,
it was actually because...</font>

15:34.680 --> 15:39.519
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..we thought you'd be the perfect
moral and spiritual guardians.</font>

15:39.520 --> 15:42.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> We thought about it for
a long time before asking you.</font>

15:42.199 --> 15:44.199
<font color="#11FF11"> So, when did you decide
to have him christened?</font>

15:44.200 --> 15:45.840
This afternoon.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.198
I saw the face of Jesus
in my Marmite

15:50.199 --> 15:52.198
and it made us get our arse in gear.

15:52.199 --> 15:54.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, when's the big day?</font>

15:54.199 --> 15:56.159
<font color="#00FFFF"> This Sunday.</font>

15:56.160 --> 15:58.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Wow, this is all very quick.</font>

15:58.199 --> 15:59.199
<font color="#11FF11"> Is it a drive-through?</font>

16:00.360 --> 16:02.519
So, I'm assuming it's a yes?

16:02.520 --> 16:04.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Of course it's a yes! </font>Oh!</font>

16:04.199 --> 16:06.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm so pleased.</font>

16:06.199 --> 16:07.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> Come on, Toby.</font>

16:07.200 --> 16:09.839
<font color="#FFFF00"> I can feel a new hat coming on.</font>

16:09.840 --> 16:12.199
<font color="#11FF11"> You do realise you'll have
to renounce Satan?</font>

16:14.200 --> 16:17.159
Well, that's good, isn't it?

16:17.160 --> 16:19.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> What's good?</font>
Well, they agreed to it.

16:19.199 --> 16:21.519
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, but Anna thinks we actually
want them to be godparents.</font>

16:21.520 --> 16:23.519
We do actually want them
to be godparents.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, but for the wrong reasons.</font>

16:25.199 --> 16:26.999
<font color="#00FFFF"> She thinks we're asking
them to be guardians</font>

16:27.000 --> 16:28.839
<font color="#00FFFF"> of the children's spirituality.</font>

16:28.840 --> 16:31.159
And that's for the wrong reasons,
is it?

16:31.160 --> 16:32.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> You know what I mean.</font>

16:32.199 --> 16:35.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> We can't tell her what's really
going on now, I feel terrible.</font>

16:35.199 --> 16:38.198
Well, it's not her you should feel
guilty about lying to.

16:38.199 --> 16:40.198
It's the all-powerful figure
who sits in judgment on us.

16:40.199 --> 16:42.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> I feel bad enough,
don't bring God into it.</font>

16:42.199 --> 16:43.520
I meant your dad.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.199
<font color="#11FF11"> Ha! Charlie, you look really stupid.</font>

16:54.200 --> 16:58.198
Be nice, Molly. Otherwise we'll
make you come to church with us.

16:58.199 --> 17:00.839
<font color="#00FFFF"> I don't think we should be
using it as a threat.</font>

17:00.840 --> 17:03.359
<font color="#00FFFF"> Go play, you know,
with the baby-sitter.</font>

17:03.360 --> 17:06.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> I can't believe I'm doing this
just to get into a school.</font>

17:06.199 --> 17:10.159
Count yourself lucky it's not
a Jewish school.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Right, Anna and Toby will be here
any minute,</font>

17:12.199 --> 17:14.358
<font color="#00FFFF"> so remember, no mentioning
your new school.</font>

17:14.359 --> 17:16.519
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#00FFFF"> You mean lie? </font>No.</font>

17:16.520 --> 17:19.519
<font color="#00FFFF"> We're just saving that surprise
for another day.</font>

17:19.520 --> 17:21.198
KNOCK ON THE DOOR

17:21.199 --> 17:24.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Unless they ask you outright,
then lie through your teeth.</font>

17:26.680 --> 17:29.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, Anna, you look amazing.</font>

17:29.199 --> 17:31.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Thanks, Lucy. I'm sorry about Toby.</font>

17:31.199 --> 17:32.679
<font color="#11FF11"> I told him just because it's church,</font>

17:32.680 --> 17:36.198
<font color="#11FF11"> there's no need to come
dressed as a jumble sale.</font>

17:36.199 --> 17:39.199
<font color="#11FF11"> Are the other guests meeting us
there?</font>

17:40.199 --> 17:41.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, erm, no.</font>

17:41.200 --> 17:43.999
<font color="#00FFFF"> We just wanted a small,
private service.</font>

17:44.000 --> 17:47.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Just us and our very special
godparents.</font>

17:47.199 --> 17:50.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> They didn't want
anyone else implicated.</font>

17:50.199 --> 17:52.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> He means involved.</font>

17:52.199 --> 17:53.519
<font color="#00FFFF"> Kids.</font>

17:53.520 --> 17:55.840
<font color="#11FF11"> So, no function afterwards, then?</font>

17:58.199 --> 18:00.360
I'll book TGI Fridays.

18:02.199 --> 18:03.199
Seems appropriate.

18:03.199 --> 18:04.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's not Friday.</font>

18:04.200 --> 18:06.199
I meant the "thank God" bit.

18:08.199 --> 18:10.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Can we go to TGI Fridays?</font>

18:10.199 --> 18:13.199
Yeah, of course. We'll pick you up
after the ceremony. <font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Yes!</font>

18:13.200 --> 18:16.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh. Are you two not coming to see
your brother getting christened?</font>

18:16.199 --> 18:19.199
No. He's only doing it so he can
get into a new school.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.839
<font color="#11FF11"> You didn't tell me Charlie
was moving school.</font>

18:24.840 --> 18:26.000
<font color="#00FFFF"> Didn't we?</font>

18:27.160 --> 18:28.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, it all happened so quickly.</font>

18:28.200 --> 18:31.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> My mum and dad offered to pay
for a private one.</font>

18:31.199 --> 18:32.199
<font color="#11FF11"> I thought Lee was opposed to them?</font>

18:32.200 --> 18:35.198
Well, I am, but they won't
live forever.

18:35.199 --> 18:38.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> I assume it's a faith school?</font>

18:38.199 --> 18:41.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Yep. </font>I see.</font>

18:41.199 --> 18:44.198
<font color="#11FF11"> So, this whole christening thing
is just a grubby little scam?</font>

18:44.199 --> 18:46.198
Well, that is one theory, yes.

18:46.199 --> 18:48.198
Other people find religion
a great source of reassurance.

18:48.199 --> 18:50.198
Oh, you mean just this one.

18:50.199 --> 18:52.198
Yes. Yes, it is.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.199
<font color="#11FF11"> How could you, Lucy?</font>

18:53.200 --> 18:55.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, I was going to be straight
with you,</font>

18:55.199 --> 18:57.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> but then you got all
emotional and I panicked.</font>

18:59.200 --> 19:01.198
<font color="#11FF11"> You're very quiet.</font>

19:01.199 --> 19:04.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, it was pretty obvious what was
going on when they first asked us.</font>

19:04.199 --> 19:06.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> What was I meant to say?
You haven't been this happy</font>

19:06.360 --> 19:10.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> since that Club Class upgrade on
the flight to the Comoros Islands.</font>

19:10.199 --> 19:13.198
<font color="#11FF11"> It's not my fault you weren't
offered one too.</font>

19:13.199 --> 19:15.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> It was our honeymoon.</font>

19:17.199 --> 19:18.519
Anyway, we haven't got time to chat.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.198
We've all got to get
to a christening.

19:20.199 --> 19:24.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Yes, you have, haven't you?
Enjoy your day, Charlie.</font>

19:24.199 --> 19:26.159
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm sorry we won't be there
to see it.</font>

19:26.160 --> 19:27.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, no, Anna. Please come.</font>

19:27.199 --> 19:30.359
Yeah. Don't miss out. It's Chocolate
Fudge Monkey Sunday.

19:30.360 --> 19:34.198
Not at the church. I mean at TGIs.

19:34.199 --> 19:35.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> I can't believe she's done that.</font>

19:36.199 --> 19:37.359
We can hardly blame her.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.198
It's like we've asked her
to donate a kidney

19:40.199 --> 19:42.359
and she's just found out
we want it for a hotpot.

19:42.360 --> 19:45.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> We've got to find someone,
and quickly.</font>

19:45.199 --> 19:47.198
<font color="#11FF11"> How do?</font>

19:47.199 --> 19:50.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> God really does move in
mysterious ways, doesn't he?</font>

20:01.199 --> 20:04.198
You do realise it's no smoking
in here? Or swearing.

20:04.199 --> 20:07.839
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, I'm sure he'll behave himself,
won't you, Charlie?</font>

20:07.840 --> 20:09.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Don't worry, son.</font>

20:09.199 --> 20:11.198
<font color="#11FF11"> I won't mess up.
This means a lot to me.</font>

20:11.199 --> 20:14.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Nobody's ever asked me
to be a godparent before.</font>

20:14.199 --> 20:15.839
<font color="#11FF11"> I wonder why.</font>

20:15.840 --> 20:17.198
<font color="#11FF11"> It was rhetorical.</font>

20:17.199 --> 20:19.840
<font color="#11FF11"> So, why aren't Wendy and Geoffrey
here?</font>

20:21.199 --> 20:24.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I don't think they'd be
too happy that we chose you</font>

20:24.199 --> 20:25.839
<font color="#00FFFF"> to be godparent over them,</font>

20:25.840 --> 20:29.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> and you wouldn't want upset
my mum and dad, would you?</font>

20:29.199 --> 20:32.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> So, perhaps it's better if we just
never mention this.</font>

20:32.199 --> 20:34.999
<font color="#00FFFF"> After all, you and Dad already
don't see eye to eye.</font>

20:35.000 --> 20:36.199
More like eye to bellybutton.

20:37.199 --> 20:38.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> Hello again.</font>

20:38.200 --> 20:42.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> And Charlie,
welcome to St Michael's.</font>

20:42.199 --> 20:44.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Toby? </font>Or not Toby.

20:44.199 --> 20:48.198
That is the question
and the answer is not Toby.

20:48.199 --> 20:51.198
We decided to just keep it
to immediate family,

20:51.199 --> 20:53.198
and this is my dad, Frank.

20:53.199 --> 20:55.519
<font color="#11FF11"> I didn't realise
you were going to be a woman.</font>

20:55.520 --> 20:58.198
Now you know why we call him Frank.

20:58.199 --> 21:01.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Fancy wetting the baby's head later?</font>

21:01.199 --> 21:04.199
Dad. I know when they're married,
it doesn't usually stop you,

21:04.200 --> 21:08.198
but surely when they're married
to God...

21:08.199 --> 21:10.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Are there no other guests arriving?</font>

21:10.199 --> 21:13.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> No. We just decided to keep it
intimate.</font>

21:13.199 --> 21:15.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Couldn't ask her side of the family.</font>

21:15.199 --> 21:16.199
<font color="#11FF11"> They're pagans.</font>

21:18.199 --> 21:21.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Just us and our special godparent.</font>

21:21.199 --> 21:23.198
<font color="#11FF11"> To think...</font>

21:23.199 --> 21:24.359
<font color="#11FF11"> ..I only came around to your house</font>

21:24.360 --> 21:27.198
<font color="#11FF11"> to give you back that 20 quid
I owed you.</font>

21:27.199 --> 21:29.519
Well, you keep that &#163;20, Father.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.198
You deserve it.

21:31.199 --> 21:32.199
<font color="#11FF11"> Thanks, son.</font>

21:32.200 --> 21:33.360
<font color="#11FF11"> That means a lot.</font>

21:34.840 --> 21:37.199
<font color="#11FF11"> You couldn't lend me another
20 quid, could you?</font>

21:42.840 --> 21:44.199
KNOCK ON THE DOOR

21:48.199 --> 21:51.198
<font color="#11FF11">Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandad.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF"> Hello, you two.</font>

21:51.199 --> 21:54.198
<font color="#00FFFF">Are Mummy and Daddy in?</font>
<font color="#11FF11"> No, we've got a baby-sitter.</font>

21:54.199 --> 21:56.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> They got you a baby-sitter?</font>

21:56.199 --> 21:59.159
<font color="#00FFFF">What about me?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> You don't need a baby-sitter.</font>

21:59.160 --> 22:00.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> You're old.</font>

22:01.360 --> 22:03.198
So, where are your mum and dad?

22:03.199 --> 22:04.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> At church.</font>

22:05.199 --> 22:07.199
Are we definitely at
the right house?

22:09.199 --> 22:11.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Are you sure they aren't
just at the supermarket?</font>

22:11.199 --> 22:14.198
<font color="#11FF11"> No. You can't get christened
at the supermarket.</font>

22:14.199 --> 22:15.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> Christened?</font>

22:16.200 --> 22:18.198
Did they tell you anything else?

22:18.199 --> 22:20.520
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yes. They said not to tell
Grandma and Grandad.</font>

22:22.360 --> 22:24.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oops.</font>

22:33.199 --> 22:37.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, thank you, Frank, for that very
memorable reading.</font>

22:37.199 --> 22:41.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> I must say, it's unusual to have
someone do all the voices.</font>

22:42.199 --> 22:44.198
<font color="#11FF11"> I do what I can.</font>

22:44.199 --> 22:47.198
<font color="#11FF11"> Those stories can be
quite preachy otherwise.</font>

22:47.199 --> 22:50.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> And this is where I invite Charlie
to join me at the font.</font>

22:50.199 --> 22:52.198
Come on, Charlie. Armbands on.

22:52.199 --> 22:53.839
<font color="#00FFFF"> How deep is it?</font>

22:53.840 --> 22:57.519
It's a water flume. It comes out
at a drain near the graveyard.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.839
<font color="#FFFF00"> Nothing that exciting,
I'm afraid, Charlie.</font>

22:59.840 --> 23:02.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's a rather simple process.
Not as dramatic as a wedding.</font>

23:02.199 --> 23:05.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> I don't get to say, "If anyone knows
any reason why this christening</font>

23:05.199 --> 23:07.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> "should not go ahead,
please declare it now."</font>

23:07.199 --> 23:09.160
<font color="#11FF11"> Stop the christening!</font>

23:10.199 --> 23:12.198
Oh, God.

23:12.199 --> 23:13.199
Gosh.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.198
Goddy gosh.

23:15.199 --> 23:16.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Mum, Dad.</font>

23:16.200 --> 23:18.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> So pleased you can make it
after all.</font>

23:18.199 --> 23:20.198
<font color="#11FF11"> I can't believe what I'm seeing.</font>

23:20.199 --> 23:22.198
<font color="#11FF11"> This is an abomination.</font>

23:22.199 --> 23:23.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> Told you. Pagans.</font>

23:25.160 --> 23:26.359
<font color="#FFFF00"> Stay away from the holy water,
Geoffrey.</font>

23:26.360 --> 23:28.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> We don't want it to burn you.</font>

23:28.199 --> 23:31.198
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm surprised to see you inside
a church, Frank.</font>

23:31.199 --> 23:34.839
<font color="#11FF11"> You might want to count
the candlesticks after he's gone.</font>

23:34.840 --> 23:37.198
Have you come to join us for
the christening? <font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Yes, we have.</font>

23:37.199 --> 23:39.199
<font color="#11FF11"> Not that we were invited.</font>

23:40.840 --> 23:44.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Mum, Dad, if I could possibly
explain it to you later?</font>

23:44.199 --> 23:47.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yes, please, because I need to get
on with christening my godson.</font>

23:47.199 --> 23:51.199
<font color="#11FF11"> Your godson? </font>You've chose him
as a godparent over us?</font>

23:52.199 --> 23:54.198
I didn't even tell us about it?

23:54.199 --> 23:56.839
<font color="#FFFF00"> Clearly, they see me as
the more God-fearing one.</font>

23:56.840 --> 23:59.198
<font color="#11FF11"> That's because you've got
more to fear.</font>

23:59.199 --> 24:01.199
<font color="#FFFF00">Mum, Dad, it's not what you think.</font>
<font color="#11FF11"> Isn't it?</font>

24:01.200 --> 24:04.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, we didn't exactly choose Frank.</font>

24:05.199 --> 24:07.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> He's only here because...</font>

24:07.199 --> 24:09.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..Toby and Anna pulled out
at the last minute.</font>

24:09.199 --> 24:11.999
<font color="#FFFF00"> You what? I thought you'd
chosen me specially.</font>

24:12.000 --> 24:15.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Sorry, Frank. You just turned up on
the doorstep at the right time.</font>

24:15.199 --> 24:19.159
<font color="#11FF11"> So it could just as easily
have been a pizza delivery
man standing here?</font>

24:19.160 --> 24:22.198
Well, if you could hurry up and
dunk him and we'll bugger off.

24:22.199 --> 24:26.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Actually, I'm just going to pop to
the vestry. Top up the holy water.</font>

24:26.199 --> 24:29.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'll leave you to chat amongst
yourselves for a moment.</font>

24:32.199 --> 24:34.198
Why didn't you tell us about this?

24:34.199 --> 24:36.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Because I thought you'd disapprove.</font>

24:36.199 --> 24:40.198
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Damn right we disapprove. </font>No,
I meant disapprove of the reason.</font>

24:40.199 --> 24:41.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> The thing is...</font>

24:43.199 --> 24:45.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..we're just doing this to get
Charlie into a better school.</font>

24:45.199 --> 24:47.198
<font color="#11FF11"> You mean the school
we're paying for?</font>

24:47.199 --> 24:49.198
And we still don't get invited
to the christening.

24:49.199 --> 24:50.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> Hang on.</font>

24:50.200 --> 24:53.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> So you're using me to get
Charlie into a posh school?</font>

24:53.199 --> 24:56.198
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, in that case, I do not want
to be the godparent.</font>

24:56.199 --> 24:59.198
Well, that solves it.
Geoffrey, Wendy.

24:59.199 --> 25:01.198
Will you do us the great honour
of being godparents?

25:01.199 --> 25:05.198
<font color="#11FF11"> No, we won't. </font>I've never been
so insulted in my life.

25:05.199 --> 25:09.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, there's nothing to be insulted
or offended about when the whole
thing's fake anyway!</font>

25:09.199 --> 25:12.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's all just a big sham to get
Charlie into the school, OK?</font>

25:26.200 --> 25:28.679
I though Christians were supposed
to be forgiving.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> She did forgive us.</font>

25:30.199 --> 25:35.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> She just wouldn't do the christening
or let Charlie into the school.</font>

25:35.199 --> 25:38.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's our parents and friends
who didn't forgive us.</font>

25:38.199 --> 25:40.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> And God, probably.</font>

25:40.199 --> 25:42.198
Exactly. We'll be lucky
to get through the week

25:42.199 --> 25:45.198
without being struck by
a plague of... What's it?

25:45.199 --> 25:46.199
Grasshoppers.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> You mean locusts.</font>

25:49.199 --> 25:51.680
You're lucky. I was going
to say spacehoppers.

25:53.199 --> 25:55.159
So now what?

25:55.160 --> 25:58.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> We'll have to start looking
at other schools, I suppose.</font>

25:58.199 --> 26:00.198
Well, let's set ourselves
a real challenge this time.

26:00.199 --> 26:02.198
See if we can get him
into an all girls one.

26:02.199 --> 26:03.200
PHONE PINGS

26:05.199 --> 26:06.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Ooh.</font>

26:06.200 --> 26:09.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's that Ofsted report on
Charlie's school. It's official now.</font>

26:09.200 --> 26:11.198
Have they changed their rating?

26:11.199 --> 26:13.519
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah. </font>Well?

26:13.520 --> 26:17.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's gone from
"good" up to "outstanding".</font>

26:17.199 --> 26:19.159
<font color="#00FFFF"> That's fantastic.</font>

26:19.160 --> 26:22.519
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, those silly mums were
flapping about nothing.</font>

26:22.520 --> 26:24.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> We don't need to move Charlie now.</font>

26:24.199 --> 26:26.519
I thought you didn't care
about the Ofsted report?

26:26.520 --> 26:29.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> Lee, if the last few days
have established anything</font>

26:29.199 --> 26:33.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> is that we're both total hypocrites.</font>

26:33.199 --> 26:34.999
<font color="#00FFFF"> Have we still got that table booked
at TGIs?</font>

26:35.000 --> 26:36.198
Yeah, why?

26:36.199 --> 26:39.198
<font color="#00FFFF"> I think we should go out and
celebrate being really good parents.</font>

26:39.199 --> 26:42.200
<font color="#00FFFF"> Good? </font>OK, requires improvement.</font>

26:47.199 --> 26:49.198
# We're not going out

26:49.199 --> 26:51.198
# Not staying in

26:51.199 --> 26:54.198
# Just hanging around
with my head in a spin

26:54.199 --> 26:57.198
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

26:57.199 --> 27:00.839
# We're not going out

27:00.840 --> 27:03.199
# We are not going out. #

27:04.305 --> 27:10.325
