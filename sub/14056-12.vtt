00:00.038 --> 00:01.613
Previously on The O.C.:

00:01.702 --> 00:02.374
Neil!

00:02.465 --> 00:03.248
Julie.

00:03.367 --> 00:04.408
Why aren't I surprised?

00:04.501 --> 00:06.872
Marissa is a real chip off the old block, isn't she?

00:06.927 --> 00:08.231
I couldn't agree with you more.

00:08.321 --> 00:09.509
Brains, beauty...

00:09.599 --> 00:11.547
The surgeon that you hooked him up with, he convinced the guy

00:11.620 --> 00:14.012
that Johnny would make a full recovery and he's back on the team.

00:14.105 --> 00:14.818
Thank you.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.047
She deserves to be happy.

00:16.133 --> 00:18.008
I'm taking Caitlin to go look at new ponies.

00:18.094 --> 00:20.693
Whatever no longer fits, we'll just send it to your sister.

00:20.775 --> 00:22.395
Thank God, Caitlin's going away to boarding school.

00:22.477 --> 00:24.074
This is no environment for a child.

00:24.164 --> 00:27.185
It's just not right for a little girl to love a hairless pony.

00:31.618 --> 00:33.054
Why do you keep touching your face?

00:33.153 --> 00:37.056
Last night, before I went to bed, I had this sensation of a pimple about to surface.

00:37.211 --> 00:40.786
This morning, the skin's as clear as a smogless sky.

00:40.913 --> 00:42.305
And that's a problem because..?

00:42.600 --> 00:44.567
Ryan, don't you see?

00:44.743 --> 00:45.575
Not so much.

00:45.675 --> 00:47.570
Things are going way too well around here.

00:47.993 --> 00:48.665
What?

00:49.930 --> 00:51.677
Marissa got back into Harbor.

00:51.768 --> 00:54.631
You guys seemed to resolve your surf-tastic love triangle.

00:54.718 --> 00:58.296
My girlfriend got a near-perfect score on her SATs, but we've never been happier.

00:58.387 --> 01:00.731
Seth, it's senior year. It's supposed to be a best year ever.

01:00.805 --> 01:03.613
No, you should know better. Every time things are going to well around here,

01:03.701 --> 01:05.707
it's when doom comes a-knocking.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.025
- Doom?
- A-knocking.

01:08.144 --> 01:09.301
Or a ringing.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.306
Right on time. Don't answer it.

01:12.399 --> 01:14.070
It's probably a flaming bag of crap.

01:14.553 --> 01:15.340
Or FedEx.

01:17.547 --> 01:18.142
Yeah.

01:19.797 --> 01:22.507
So, I show up at my house to surprise my mom.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.269
And this Persian dude answers the door.

01:24.371 --> 01:25.339
Uh, I'm sorry?

01:25.429 --> 01:27.085
I figured he was the new butler.

01:27.271 --> 01:30.432
But then I saw his shoes, Prada.

01:30.534 --> 01:32.865
I thought, "Maybe he's my new stepdad."

01:32.983 --> 01:35.411
And I was about to, like, hug him

01:35.518 --> 01:37.269
and then his wife shows up.

01:37.355 --> 01:40.836
No matter how rich the guy is, my mother would never join a harem.

01:40.940 --> 01:41.485
Uh, I don't...

01:41.588 --> 01:44.325
So I was like, "Persian dude, what are you doing at my house?

01:44.426 --> 01:45.991
And where is my mother?"

01:46.094 --> 01:47.858
And he was all like, "Who's your mother?"

01:47.957 --> 01:49.320
So I told him.

01:49.426 --> 01:52.968
And he tells me that my mother moved and that all the mail is being forwarded here.

01:53.067 --> 01:54.378
Uh, I think that you may...

01:54.480 --> 01:56.219
Are you gonna invite me in or what?

01:56.334 --> 01:57.554
Geez, Ryan.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.688
I see Newport hasn't improved your manners at all.

02:00.932 --> 02:02.002
Oh, my God.

02:02.808 --> 02:04.622
Oh, my God. Kaitlin Cooper?

02:04.721 --> 02:06.724
Weird neighborhood kid, hi!

02:07.418 --> 02:09.471
You've, uh... I mean, you've grown...

02:09.554 --> 02:10.369
Boobs?

02:10.899 --> 02:12.241
No, I...

02:18.269 --> 02:19.975
Oh, it's a-knocking.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:53.124 --> 02:54.339
Kaitlin Cooper?

02:54.668 --> 02:56.620
It must be two years since she's been back.

02:56.709 --> 02:59.065
Did she mention why she's home in the middle of a semester?

02:59.157 --> 03:01.008
We never really got past where home was.

03:01.101 --> 03:04.534
Oh, Julie wants us to wait till she gets here before we tell Kaitlin...

03:04.616 --> 03:07.246
That her family's a prime candidate for Pimp My Double-wide?

03:07.341 --> 03:08.808
- Hey, guys. Good morning.
- Good morning.

03:08.896 --> 03:12.680
You ready to go? It's the third day of the Pride and Prejudice miniseries in English class.

03:12.778 --> 03:17.084
Summer, the show you're about to see has all the makings of a classic Jane Austen novel.

03:17.163 --> 03:20.179
You've got sisters, lies and bosoms.

03:20.475 --> 03:21.370
Kaitlin's back.

03:21.548 --> 03:22.502
Mini-Cooper?

03:22.606 --> 03:23.931
Mini-Coop not so mini.

03:24.208 --> 03:24.968
Kaitlin?

03:25.519 --> 03:26.346
Where's my baby?

03:26.444 --> 03:27.817
She's getting herself together.

03:27.923 --> 03:29.241
The kid's a little confused.

03:29.365 --> 03:30.891
I don't know what I'm gonna tell her.

03:31.465 --> 03:34.597
I mean, I just wanted to protect her from everything that's gone on around here.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.532
Shootings, funerals, public school.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.706
Well just explain it to her. She'll understand.

03:38.804 --> 03:40.950
Honey, you might've understood. You're your father's daughter.

03:41.053 --> 03:43.132
Kaitlin's me. She's not gonna want our life.

03:43.242 --> 03:44.179
She came home.

03:44.281 --> 03:46.433
And that means she wants her family more than anything.

03:46.529 --> 03:47.461
Mom?

03:52.002 --> 03:53.423
Oh, baby.

03:58.517 --> 03:59.708
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:02.574 --> 04:04.315
Sweetie, what are you doing here?

04:04.475 --> 04:06.324
Do you even look at my calendar?

04:06.572 --> 04:08.096
It's  mid-winter break.

04:09.783 --> 04:10.760
I knew that.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.073
It's just, I figured... Isn't it Fashion Week?

04:14.159 --> 04:16.814
I thought you'd be in Paris with Alex, like last year.

04:16.927 --> 04:19.762
Front row at Chanel. I saw the photo on Wire Image.

04:19.933 --> 04:22.053
I thought that you'd be happy to see me.

04:22.177 --> 04:23.617
Well, I am. Of course.

04:23.692 --> 04:25.809
Hey, we're so happy to see you.

04:27.037 --> 04:29.732
So that guy, Caleb, said that you moved.

04:31.781 --> 04:33.582
I think we're gonna be late for school, guys.

04:33.956 --> 04:35.358
Sandy, can I talk to you about the launch party?

04:35.458 --> 04:36.831
Oh, I love discussing a party.

04:38.224 --> 04:39.987
I'm actually gonna be late for school, too,

04:40.078 --> 04:42.063
but let's do something later and catch up, okay?

04:42.679 --> 04:43.594
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:44.948 --> 04:46.649
Okay, so what's going on?

04:47.357 --> 04:50.340
Okay, do you remember that e-mail that I sent you about Caleb?

04:51.683 --> 04:54.599
There were some financial complications afterwards.

04:56.002 --> 04:57.233
Oh, my God.

04:57.898 --> 04:58.942
We live in a trailer.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.818
Well, yes.

05:02.614 --> 05:05.984
But not... live, live.

05:06.035 --> 05:08.423
Um, we're more like refugees.

05:08.655 --> 05:11.846
We're only half a mile from the beach, and well,

05:12.352 --> 05:13.886
it's  Tiffany blue.

05:15.790 --> 05:17.617
Oh, honey, this is so temporary.

05:17.796 --> 05:21.725
Once Kirsten's and my business is up and running, everything's gonna be just like it was.

05:22.135 --> 05:23.328
So let's go inside.

05:24.800 --> 05:29.265
And then you pull it open like this... and... voila!

05:30.375 --> 05:31.460
It's a bed.

05:31.686 --> 05:32.665
Wow...

05:33.254 --> 05:36.332
that's versatile.

05:36.414 --> 05:37.491
Oh, honey.

05:37.841 --> 05:42.517
I'm sorry. I know this isn't what you're used to, but think of it as a life experience.

05:42.612 --> 05:45.502
And this is exactly the kind of place Britney Spears is from.

05:45.616 --> 05:48.063
Mom, it's okay. Really.

05:48.326 --> 05:51.637
I mean, it's like a slumber party. The three of us.

05:51.986 --> 05:52.898
Here.

05:53.940 --> 05:57.896
Oh, you still have this puppy Marissa gave you.

05:57.992 --> 06:00.728
Although you didn't really care for him until you found out he was a purse

06:00.815 --> 06:02.713
and you could put your pretend credit cards in his belly.

06:02.822 --> 06:04.576
Yeah, it was that summer in Tahoe.

06:04.769 --> 06:06.577
The whole family together.

06:07.447 --> 06:09.127
I guess it's sentimental.

06:11.313 --> 06:12.705
I know, let's get our nails done.

06:12.788 --> 06:15.206
I want to hear everything you've been up to in Montecito.

06:15.402 --> 06:19.020
Although I'm supposed to be helping Kirsten with our launch... but she'll understand.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.981
You got a message?

06:24.080 --> 06:25.443
Somebody from school?

06:26.747 --> 06:29.437
A boy? Hmm...?

06:29.750 --> 06:33.224
Oh, my little girl's growing up.

06:34.221 --> 06:35.287
I'm gonna call Kirsten.

06:38.803 --> 06:40.498
Hey, it's me.

06:41.414 --> 06:43.453
I can't believe you just took off like that.

06:43.539 --> 06:46.018
Don't think just because you left town, I'm not gonna...

06:50.995 --> 06:54.452
It's just the Kaitlin I know is obsessed with her hairless pony.

06:55.717 --> 06:57.849
I feel like I missed this whole part of her life.

06:57.953 --> 06:58.780
What, puberty?

07:00.097 --> 07:01.230
And it's all my fault.

07:01.353 --> 07:02.432
Nah, what are you talking about?

07:02.533 --> 07:05.679
Well, I mean, it's not like I ever tried to keep in touch.

07:05.894 --> 07:08.246
In fact, we were never really close.

07:08.342 --> 07:10.078
It was always her and my mom versus me and my dad.

07:10.174 --> 07:11.502
Well, she's home now. You can fix that.

07:11.613 --> 07:16.732
Are you talking about Kaitlin's transformation from horsy-tweener to lanky-limb jail bait?

07:17.614 --> 07:20.801
Cohen, one more perky word about Coop's not-so-Mini-Coop,

07:20.877 --> 07:23.099
and I may have to staple your tongue to your collar.

07:23.182 --> 07:25.405
Hey, there you are! Hi.

07:25.493 --> 07:26.815
Hey, Taylor. Oh.

07:27.731 --> 07:29.976
Thanks  so much for everything at that meeting last week.

07:30.067 --> 07:31.764
Oh, of course.

07:31.994 --> 07:35.934
You were lonely at that school. You had no friends, no one to talk to.

07:36.037 --> 07:38.376
Kind of like Charlton Heston in Planet of the Apes.

07:38.464 --> 07:39.877
I think that was Mark Wahlberg.

07:40.036 --> 07:43.014
Actually, I had a couple good friends.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.794
But not like our group here.

07:46.323 --> 07:47.089
Right?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.136
I should get to class.

07:49.229 --> 07:50.065
Uh, me, too.

07:53.555 --> 07:54.599
The poor thing.

07:55.699 --> 07:58.379
It must be really hard for her, readjusting.

07:58.876 --> 08:00.868
Kind of like coming back from 'Nam.

08:01.891 --> 08:03.478
Thankfully she has us.

08:06.503 --> 08:07.897
Hey, you all right?

08:07.990 --> 08:09.753
Taylor can be a little Taylor.

08:09.856 --> 08:13.239
No, she just made me realize I haven't talked to Johnny since I got here.

08:13.757 --> 08:15.718
I mean, I've left him messages.

08:16.595 --> 08:19.222
The tour starts soon. I hope he hasn't left yet.

08:19.326 --> 08:20.641
Nah, I don't think he'd do that.

08:20.795 --> 08:23.957
Why don't you try, uh, what's-his-name, Bizarro Seth.

08:24.065 --> 08:24.960
Chili?

08:25.474 --> 08:27.781
Well, I could. Thanks.

08:27.892 --> 08:29.682
Yeah, no problem. All right, see you at lunch.

08:29.921 --> 08:32.764
Dude, will you please just call her back?

08:32.933 --> 08:36.621
This whole sacrificing-your-happiness-for-hers thing clearly is not working.

08:36.729 --> 08:38.102
No, it wasn't a sacrifice, all right?

08:38.219 --> 08:41.738
I just thought my life would be simpler without her.

08:41.816 --> 08:43.857
Yeah, it's real simpler. You're miserable.

08:43.953 --> 08:46.979
Dude, will you please just take my phone and call her?

08:49.276 --> 08:50.616
It's like I summoned her.

08:50.848 --> 08:51.646
Marissa?

08:52.485 --> 08:54.558
Hey, Chili. Have you seen Johnny?

08:54.645 --> 08:57.865
As a matter of fact, Harper is right next to me.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.391
Hey, Marissa.

09:03.478 --> 09:06.073
Hey, I called you a few times. Did you get my messages?

09:06.168 --> 09:09.114
Yeah, sorry. Um, I've just been really busy.

09:09.220 --> 09:10.907
Of course, packing and stuff?

09:11.228 --> 09:12.561
Yeah, packing.

09:12.953 --> 09:16.304
Okay, well, my sister's in town. I'd love for you to meet her before you leave.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.460
Oh, yeah, I don't know.

09:18.579 --> 09:20.608
Um, maybe if I have time.

09:20.707 --> 09:22.996
Come on, you're not really gonna leave without saying good-bye?

09:24.797 --> 09:27.475
The diner... 4:30. Please?

09:28.160 --> 09:29.262
I'll see you there.

09:36.163 --> 09:37.594
Veronica? What are you doing here?

09:37.687 --> 09:38.803
Hello, Kirsten.

09:39.174 --> 09:41.954
I hear you and Julie are starting a new dating service.

09:43.290 --> 09:47.487
I want you to set me up with the delicious Dr. Neil Roberts.

09:48.438 --> 09:50.094
The father of Marissa's best friend?

09:50.181 --> 09:53.096
The girl you called Little Miss Columbine at last week's board meeting?

09:53.280 --> 09:54.663
Do you really think he'd go out with you?

09:54.754 --> 09:55.860
Of course not.

09:55.990 --> 09:58.385
If, however, I could talk to him,

09:58.645 --> 10:00.297
say, over a candlelit dinner,

10:00.396 --> 10:04.833
I'm sure I could convince him that I was just a concerned parent looking out for her daughter.

10:05.118 --> 10:06.338
And that's where you come in.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.059
And why would I help you?

10:08.179 --> 10:09.357
Marissa's back at Harbor.

10:09.452 --> 10:11.560
But her involvement in after-school activities--

10:11.703 --> 10:14.965
Senior Day, prom, graduation-- is yet to be determined.

10:15.089 --> 10:17.644
And I carry a lot of weight with the Parents' Association.

10:17.776 --> 10:21.052
You might say I am the Parents' Association.

10:21.155 --> 10:24.555
You're gonna hold a 17-year-old girl hostage for a date?

10:24.616 --> 10:26.612
A good man is hard to find, Kirsten.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.983
I'm free tomorrow if you're wondering.

10:37.539 --> 10:39.866
Oh, you'll have the contracts by Friday.

10:39.950 --> 10:42.501
Yeah. Oh, it's great, Sid. I'll talk to you then.

10:44.637 --> 10:47.165
Well, this is a wonderful surprise.

10:47.265 --> 10:48.228
I wish it was.

10:49.999 --> 10:51.480
Sandy, I have a problem.

10:53.661 --> 10:56.216
Veronica Townsend came by to see me this morning.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.715
She wants me to set her up with Neil Roberts.

10:58.814 --> 10:59.549
Good luck.

10:59.657 --> 11:03.514
And she threatened to make Marissa's life a living hell at Harbor if I don't.

11:03.625 --> 11:04.513
And she can do it.

11:04.617 --> 11:08.268
We  can't give in to threats like that. We don't negotiate with the Newpsies.

11:08.372 --> 11:10.936
I know, but Marissa's been through a lot,

11:11.118 --> 11:13.566
and all Neil has to do is take her out for dinner tomorrow night.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.465
Well, so, what do you want me to do about it?

11:15.561 --> 11:16.826
You're the one with the dating service.

11:16.922 --> 11:17.817
Neil isn't a client.

11:17.930 --> 11:19.195
And I'm not an employee.

11:19.306 --> 11:22.060
No, but you are Sandy Cohen, professional persuader.

11:22.163 --> 11:25.565
You guys play golf together, and you're... guys.

11:25.778 --> 11:27.813
And I'm calling in a wifely favor.

11:28.323 --> 11:29.259
Just call.

11:35.964 --> 11:37.607
Shopping was such a good idea.

11:37.708 --> 11:40.139
Yeah, even if I was at a thrift store.

11:40.231 --> 11:43.094
Hey, vintage is very in right now.

11:44.041 --> 11:45.885
So who am I meeting again?

11:46.155 --> 11:48.521
Oh, my friend Johnny, from Newport Union.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.514
I guess he's going away on this surfing trip,

11:51.610 --> 11:53.955
and I just don't want to lose touch, you know?

11:54.048 --> 11:57.046
Do I know about losing touch? Hmm?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.149
K aitlin...

11:59.140 --> 12:03.865
Mom, in her own deranged way, was just trying to protect you.

12:04.122 --> 12:09.120
And I was... I don't know, but it won't happen again.

12:09.272 --> 12:12.387
Yeah, I know. It's just I'm not a little kid anymore, you know?

12:12.452 --> 12:13.486
I know.

12:14.244 --> 12:15.212
There they are.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.834
Which one's Johnny?

12:16.945 --> 12:18.643
Perfect bone structure or Carrot Top?

12:18.740 --> 12:20.431
Hey, you're definitely not a kid, huh?

12:20.532 --> 12:21.221
Hey, guys.

12:21.322 --> 12:21.799
Hey.

12:21.910 --> 12:23.926
So, Kaitlin, this is Chili and Johnny.

12:24.025 --> 12:24.846
It's nice to meet you.

12:24.942 --> 12:25.627
Hi.

12:26.110 --> 12:26.826
Hey, Marissa.

12:26.998 --> 12:27.839
Hi.

12:28.549 --> 12:29.643
Thanks for coming.

12:37.398 --> 12:39.126
So, uh... when do you leave?

12:39.227 --> 12:40.433
- April.
- Next week.

12:41.933 --> 12:44.832
Right. He leaves next week for training.

12:45.171 --> 12:46.625
Tour starts in April.

12:47.257 --> 12:51.127
Um... dude, did I lock my car? I think I forgot to lock it.

12:53.433 --> 12:58.124
There's been a lot of thefts in the area lately. He's got a bunch of cassette tapes in there.

12:58.213 --> 12:59.194
Can you excuse me?

12:59.394 --> 13:02.640
Um... much coffee, small bladder.

13:04.846 --> 13:06.011
What's going on?

13:06.185 --> 13:08.162
Marissa, do I have to spell it out for you?

13:10.078 --> 13:11.157
Okay, guess I do.

13:11.204 --> 13:15.828
Look, he knew that you weren't going to go back to Harbor while he was still there, so...

13:17.757 --> 13:19.973
He told me that he was leaving.

13:22.583 --> 13:23.894
Oh, my God.

13:24.161 --> 13:25.017
Johnny!

13:26.342 --> 13:26.962
Hey.

13:27.548 --> 13:29.975
So, how long have you been in love with my sister?

13:34.785 --> 13:35.982
We're just friends.

13:36.124 --> 13:36.852
Good.

13:36.947 --> 13:39.756
Because I'm sure, as you know, she's not available.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.953
Unlike, say me.

13:48.469 --> 13:49.311
Yeah.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:53.701 --> 13:55.623
Hi, uh, is this the Cohen house?

13:55.735 --> 13:56.500
It is. Can I help you?

13:56.592 --> 13:58.905
I'm looking for someone. I guess I had the wrong address.

13:58.997 --> 14:02.059
Uh, a Persian guy said I could find her here. Kaitlin Cooper?

14:03.154 --> 14:03.943
You a friend of hers?

14:04.034 --> 14:05.358
I really need to get ahold of her.

14:05.459 --> 14:06.656
Is she here or not?

14:08.270 --> 14:12.358
Look, man. I haven't seen Kaitlin since she was 11 and rode a pony.

14:13.960 --> 14:17.249
All right. Well, if she shows up, call me.

14:20.756 --> 14:21.789
It's important.

14:50.304 --> 14:51.352
Hey, Ryan.

14:51.581 --> 14:52.324
What's up?

14:52.438 --> 14:53.250
Your sister around?

14:53.358 --> 14:54.754
No, she went out.

14:56.692 --> 14:57.804
Can I help you?

14:59.313 --> 15:00.240
Maybe.

15:02.159 --> 15:06.063
There's this guy... showed up at the house last night, looking for you.

15:07.184 --> 15:08.147
Justin?

15:08.781 --> 15:09.605
You know him?

15:11.411 --> 15:14.126
He's from Montecito and he goes to...

15:15.081 --> 15:16.607
I met him at a mixer.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.853
Is he your, uh, boyfriend?

15:18.969 --> 15:20.886
I barely even spoke to the guy.

15:21.373 --> 15:22.967
And he kept on calling me.

15:23.091 --> 15:24.544
Coming by my school.

15:25.213 --> 15:28.914
I finally told my dorm mother, and it got him in trouble.

15:29.071 --> 15:32.645
And now he's like, "You're messing up my chances in Princeton."

15:35.065 --> 15:37.136
I can't believe that he showed up here.

15:37.872 --> 15:40.118
I mean, I had already changed my cell phone.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.000
All right, I'll take care of it.

15:44.051 --> 15:45.558
And you won't tell Marissa?

15:47.134 --> 15:49.673
I mean, we're just starting to get to know each other again.

15:49.770 --> 15:52.300
And I don't want her to think that I'm some stalker magnet.

15:52.388 --> 15:54.399
And I don't want her to worry.

16:01.908 --> 16:02.663
Hi.

16:03.225 --> 16:03.923
Hey.

16:05.407 --> 16:07.518
- So, Chili...
- Told you?

16:08.498 --> 16:09.295
Yeah.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.797
He was never one to keep a secret.

16:12.084 --> 16:14.933
Well, what you did was pretty amazing.

16:15.332 --> 16:16.806
I just wanted to thank you.

16:16.915 --> 16:18.963
Yeah, I'm a real martyr.

16:20.955 --> 16:24.016
Uh, so what are you gonna do now?

16:24.333 --> 16:26.497
Since you're not going on tour.

16:26.693 --> 16:28.386
I hadn't really thought about it.

16:28.964 --> 16:32.126
Well, I mean, you could always apply to college for next January.

16:32.215 --> 16:33.258
No,  I don't think so.

16:33.357 --> 16:34.131
I could help you.

16:34.236 --> 16:35.394
Listen, Marissa.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.408
It's not your problem anymore.

16:39.953 --> 16:42.203
You know, you're back where you belong, and...

16:42.727 --> 16:48.082
you know, my life, maybe it's not to tour the world to surf, but...

16:49.627 --> 16:51.495
I don't need you saving me.

16:51.934 --> 16:54.202
It's just that you did this incredible thing for me and I...

16:54.246 --> 16:55.914
Is that what you think?

16:57.727 --> 16:59.700
I needed you to leave.

17:01.347 --> 17:05.347
So, I'm back at Harbor, but what are you saying?

17:05.435 --> 17:07.586
That you don't ever want to see me again?

17:07.690 --> 17:09.864
Yeah, I guess that's what I'm saying.

17:12.079 --> 17:14.944
Right now I just need you out of my life.

17:23.332 --> 17:24.211
Okay.

17:35.376 --> 17:35.982
Hello?

17:36.098 --> 17:39.117
Neil, hey! It's Sandy. I-I hope I'm not interrupting.

17:39.211 --> 17:41.048
No, no, no. Not at all, Sandy. How can I help you?

17:41.150 --> 17:44.804
Well, there's a bit of a situation with Marissa.

17:44.903 --> 17:47.282
Anything I can do? Marissa and her mom mean a lot to me.

17:47.375 --> 17:48.527
Well, this is awkward.

17:49.211 --> 17:50.417
You know Veronica Townsend?

17:50.493 --> 17:54.272
Do I know Veronica Townsend? Sandy, I know every former A-cup in this town.

17:54.369 --> 17:56.663
Well, what would you think about having dinner with her tonight?

17:57.172 --> 17:58.233
You mean a date?

17:58.332 --> 18:01.962
Look, I know she is a bitch on wheels, but she wants to go out with you

18:02.058 --> 18:05.818
and she's willing to make Marissa's life at Harbor very difficult if it doesn't go through.

18:05.899 --> 18:07.437
Oh, come on Sandy. That's preposterous.

18:07.519 --> 18:10.398
I wouldn't be asking you if I didn't think she'd follow through on this.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.847
Look, it's one dinner. Crowded restaurant.

18:12.938 --> 18:15.398
Meet there, Kirsten and I'll pick up the tab.

18:15.521 --> 18:16.654
How horrible can it be?

18:16.744 --> 18:18.261
Trust me, it'll be horrible.

18:18.388 --> 18:19.615
I owe you.

18:19.727 --> 18:20.665
Thanks.

18:37.095 --> 18:38.227
Good, you're here.

18:38.329 --> 18:39.049
Where's Kaitlin?

18:39.161 --> 18:39.908
She came with you, right?

18:40.029 --> 18:41.527
Nah. I didn't think that was a very good idea.

18:41.601 --> 18:44.461
Look, best thing for you to do is get in your car,

18:44.564 --> 18:47.096
go back where you came from, put this behind you.

18:47.200 --> 18:50.992
I'm not going anywhere without the $1,500 bucks she stole from my brother.

18:53.063 --> 18:55.113
She says she barely knows you.

18:55.461 --> 18:57.175
We've been going out for like a month.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.428
I wanted her to meet my brother, Sam.

18:59.516 --> 19:01.095
He's a Gamma Tau at UCSB.

19:01.195 --> 19:03.381
They were having a party, so I brought her along.

19:03.691 --> 19:07.556
And then she, uh, ditched me, ran off with the door money and left town.

19:08.267 --> 19:11.311
Three guys are stuffing a gym bag and take off.

19:11.415 --> 19:15.070
So I'm supposed to take the word of three drunk frat brothers over a 14-year-old girl?

19:15.169 --> 19:16.244
Fourteen?

19:16.451 --> 19:18.052
She told me she was 16.

19:21.750 --> 19:23.746
Like I said, put this behind you.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.298
I'm trying to help her.

19:25.676 --> 19:28.802
All right, it's not my money, and now it's out of my hands.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.105
I had three messages from Taylor this morning.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.796
I told you she has abused puppy syndrome.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.594
If you show her the tiniest bit of affection,

19:44.680 --> 19:46.559
she's gonna follow you around for the rest of your life.

19:46.635 --> 19:49.076
I know, but she's kind of our responsibility now.

19:49.493 --> 19:51.652
- I found you!
- Oh, my God!

19:52.022 --> 19:53.835
Um, who let you in?

19:53.935 --> 19:55.455
I speak fluent housekeeper.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.711
Guess what? My mom's getting set up with your dad!

19:59.545 --> 20:01.099
Oh, my God.

20:01.204 --> 20:03.650
I know, if they get married, we could be sisters.

20:06.267 --> 20:09.095
Okay, so I'm gonna go take a quick spin around and see which room I might want.

20:09.194 --> 20:10.556
Okay? I'll be right back.

20:10.671 --> 20:11.692
Okay.

20:13.904 --> 20:16.072
She is so going back to the pound.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.663
No, no, no. The football players are the real pussycats.

20:19.771 --> 20:22.964
It's the female tennis players that will kill you in your sleep.

20:23.062 --> 20:28.132
You know in Russia, rumor has it that Sharapova's rep is former KGB.

20:28.225 --> 20:31.278
I had no idea being a sport's agent was so dangerous.

20:35.554 --> 20:37.648
Mom, this place is way too expensive.

20:37.772 --> 20:40.983
Oh, but, honey, it's your homecoming. It's a special occasion.

20:44.093 --> 20:44.943
Mom?

20:45.314 --> 20:47.358
- You know where we should go?
- Here, you just said so.

20:47.390 --> 20:50.728
The Crab Cooker. We haven't been there in years. It'll be so fun.

20:50.823 --> 20:52.497
But... okay.

21:02.454 --> 21:03.277
Hey.

21:03.410 --> 21:05.444
Hey. Oh, I'm almost ready.

21:05.626 --> 21:07.645
Take your time. The movie doesn't start for a while.

21:07.745 --> 21:08.611
Okay.

21:09.182 --> 21:10.018
You all right?

21:10.329 --> 21:13.257
I'm trying to find my stupid jacket.

21:13.762 --> 21:14.652
I'll help you.

21:14.763 --> 21:17.393
It's brown with dings on it.

21:18.107 --> 21:19.335
And it's stupid.

21:21.544 --> 21:23.270
I got in a fight with Johnny.

21:23.414 --> 21:26.314
He lied about the surf tour. He was never going.

21:28.874 --> 21:30.277
You knew, didn't you?

21:30.379 --> 21:33.483
Yeah, and I should've told you, but I mean, the guy did a good thing.

21:33.531 --> 21:35.297
He did it to get rid of me!

21:35.510 --> 21:38.047
And, I mean, even though he's not going now,

21:38.150 --> 21:40.096
he still says he doesn't ever want to see me again.

21:40.176 --> 21:42.019
Okay, but he's in an awkward position.

21:42.131 --> 21:43.719
You gotta respect that. Give him some time.

21:45.626 --> 21:46.544
I know.

21:46.750 --> 21:49.574
Look, you, uh... You got your sister back here.

21:49.709 --> 21:50.617
Yeah...

21:51.815 --> 21:53.241
I think I do have a great boyfriend.

21:53.335 --> 21:55.340
You have a great boyfriend, too.

21:55.453 --> 21:57.400
And I'm just getting to know my sister.

21:58.340 --> 22:00.175
So, life could be worse.

22:03.591 --> 22:04.477
Hey!

22:04.935 --> 22:08.804
- Hey.
- Awesome.

22:23.152 --> 22:24.703
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

22:24.818 --> 22:26.672
You seem pensive. Scoot down.

22:28.679 --> 22:31.014
So, Kaitlin is up to something.

22:31.170 --> 22:33.476
Dude, I told you, doom.

22:33.584 --> 22:34.430
I know.

22:34.580 --> 22:36.062
All right, hit me with it. What is it?

22:36.173 --> 22:38.673
All right, so this guy showed up looking for her.

22:38.785 --> 22:41.143
And when I asked her about it, she said he'd been stalking her, right.

22:41.243 --> 22:43.411
But when you went to give him the get-out-of-town speech...

22:43.507 --> 22:46.075
He said she stole money from some frat party.

22:46.262 --> 22:49.293
And then I found this bag he described in the trailer.

22:49.402 --> 22:52.870
Oh, she's Jimmy Cooper's daughter. Theft is in her blood.

22:52.978 --> 22:54.701
I want to give her a chance to explain, but...

22:54.802 --> 22:56.215
Hey guys, good morning.

22:56.329 --> 22:59.004
Hey, I love how people just come in now.

22:59.103 --> 23:02.675
No more of that useless back and forth through the front door.

23:02.806 --> 23:05.506
So, we're going to go get pancakes. You guys want to come?

23:07.011 --> 23:09.992
Uh, actually, Marissa, I'm going to need to borrow you for a second.

23:10.108 --> 23:12.452
'Cause we're going to have to work on Summer's birthday present.

23:12.567 --> 23:13.794
Her birthday's not for like eight months.

23:13.913 --> 23:16.229
What to get the girl that has everything?

23:16.345 --> 23:17.834
We need to plan early.

23:20.722 --> 23:22.998
So, I went to see Justin yesterday.

23:23.121 --> 23:24.748
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

23:24.857 --> 23:26.383
He said you stole some money?

23:26.611 --> 23:28.662
What money? I don't know what you're talking...

23:28.763 --> 23:30.908
I found the bag in your stuff.

23:33.083 --> 23:34.927
Okay, so I took it.

23:35.044 --> 23:36.794
But it was for a good reason.

23:37.707 --> 23:38.386
Please.

23:38.491 --> 23:41.189
Justin's brother Sam is dating my friend, Megan.

23:41.297 --> 23:43.510
He seemed like the perfect guy, right?

23:43.610 --> 23:45.684
Till she told him that she was pregnant.

23:46.699 --> 23:47.836
Okay, and then what happened?

23:47.936 --> 23:52.745
So she asked him for some money to, you know, take care of it.

23:52.895 --> 23:54.794
And he said it wasn't his problem.

23:55.196 --> 23:56.622
So I took it.

23:57.756 --> 24:00.950
Do you want to call Megan and ask her how her abortion went?

24:01.739 --> 24:04.491
Whatever happened, you need to tell Marissa. Okay?

24:04.595 --> 24:06.790
You know I can't tell her. You know how she is.

24:06.913 --> 24:11.096
Seth, I'm sure whichever action figure you choose, Summer will be equally thrilled.

24:11.286 --> 24:12.460
Can we go?

24:13.245 --> 24:16.299
You know, I lost my appetite.

24:16.579 --> 24:18.446
Can you guys just drop me off on the way?

24:18.565 --> 24:20.031
Yeah, sure.

24:22.911 --> 24:24.607
Is everything okay?

24:29.477 --> 24:30.678
Morning, sweetheart.

24:32.550 --> 24:34.237
Late night last night?

24:34.746 --> 24:37.267
Actually, I wanted to tell you I went on a date.

24:37.370 --> 24:38.728
With Veronica Townsend?

24:38.835 --> 24:39.475
How'd you know?

24:39.622 --> 24:43.285
Word gets around when Orange County's Cruella nabs her next puppy.

24:45.194 --> 24:48.477
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I thought it would just be that one dinner.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.000
What do you mean "you thought"?

24:50.307 --> 24:54.719
One dinner I get. One dinner is a man on the rebound with a severe lapse of judgment.

24:54.822 --> 24:56.571
All right, that's enough.

24:57.259 --> 24:59.540
She happens to be a misunderstood woman.

24:59.639 --> 25:01.981
Dad, she is an evil bitch.

25:02.099 --> 25:04.285
Her daughter was picking out paint chips for her new room.

25:04.367 --> 25:05.793
Which is your study by the way.

25:05.894 --> 25:08.841
Summer, I am taking Veronica to the launch party at the Cohens' tonight,

25:08.951 --> 25:11.631
and I expect you to at least be polite to her.

25:13.572 --> 25:14.498
Fine.

25:19.146 --> 25:23.538
Gus, I'm sorry. My mom said I can't open the door for you again.

25:23.657 --> 25:25.948
Even if you actually have candy.

25:26.056 --> 25:27.144
It's Johnny.

25:30.676 --> 25:31.444
Oh.

25:31.891 --> 25:32.530
Hi.

25:32.688 --> 25:34.155
Hey, um, is Marissa here?

25:34.294 --> 25:37.343
How come nobody ever comes knocking on this door looking for me?

25:37.589 --> 25:39.074
Sorry, I just...

25:39.664 --> 25:42.593
I said some stuff to her yesterday. I wanted to apologize.

25:42.691 --> 25:44.247
I'm afraid she's not here.

25:45.323 --> 25:46.947
Oh, okay.

25:47.144 --> 25:52.542
But... my mom's having this launch party tonight for her new company.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.763
It's at the Cohens'.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.415
She'll be there.

25:56.925 --> 25:58.395
Maybe you should stop by.

25:58.567 --> 26:00.015
I don't think that's such a good idea.

26:00.129 --> 26:02.779
Come on, I'm inviting you.

26:04.428 --> 26:07.587
So at least there's one person there that's not totally lame.

26:09.627 --> 26:11.130
Maybe I'll stop by.

26:11.867 --> 26:13.833
To apologize to Marissa.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.364
So, tell me.

26:28.773 --> 26:29.664
Is it that obvious?

26:29.771 --> 26:31.405
Well, I mean, you barely touched your short stack.

26:31.508 --> 26:32.924
I can tell when something's up.

26:33.024 --> 26:34.058
It's Kaitlin.

26:34.184 --> 26:35.489
There's this guy looking for her.

26:35.603 --> 26:38.289
Says she stole money from his brother.

26:38.429 --> 26:40.610
She stole from another kid? No way.

26:40.726 --> 26:41.897
She admitted it.

26:42.003 --> 26:48.732
But she says she took it because the brother got her friend pregnant and she needed it.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.144
I can't believe it.

26:50.266 --> 26:51.114
Well, I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

26:51.204 --> 26:53.755
Why would he come after her if her story is true?

26:55.130 --> 26:56.767
So you think she's lying?

26:56.879 --> 26:58.993
I don't know. I think you need to talk to her.

27:00.501 --> 27:03.186
And accuse her of being a thief?

27:03.299 --> 27:06.061
I mean, after everything we put her through, that'll really build her trust.

27:06.157 --> 27:09.517
Well, I don't think the guy's going away without his money.

27:10.274 --> 27:12.839
All right, well, I'll talk to her after the party.

27:12.936 --> 27:15.065
Till then we'll just have to keep an eye on her.

27:16.761 --> 27:18.876
Uh, check the propane. Thank you.

27:25.775 --> 27:26.684
How's it going?

27:26.813 --> 27:27.628
Great.

27:28.093 --> 27:31.588
I've done maybe 12, and I've got about a hundred to go.

27:31.691 --> 27:32.952
Make that 102.

27:33.104 --> 27:36.911
I've added Neil Roberts and Veronica Townsend to the guest list.

27:37.033 --> 27:38.599
You've got to be kidding me.

27:38.765 --> 27:39.944
- Did Sandy...
- What?

27:40.057 --> 27:41.987
Tell me they were dating? No.

27:42.093 --> 27:45.134
I had to find that out myself last night at the Yacht Club.

27:45.401 --> 27:46.576
It's just...

27:47.892 --> 27:49.043
What is it?

27:49.177 --> 27:53.477
Well, for the past few weeks Neil and I have gotten quite close.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.199
And sure, the man is a real catch.

27:55.306 --> 27:57.340
A wealthy doctor, estate with pool and tennis court,

27:57.429 --> 28:00.826
but I was just grateful that he's been so kind to Marissa

28:00.929 --> 28:04.789
and then last night I saw him with Veronica and it hit me.

28:04.990 --> 28:06.965
I think I have feelings for him.

28:08.064 --> 28:09.747
Romantic feelings.

28:11.552 --> 28:13.910
Now he's with that witch who tried to harpoon Marissa

28:14.022 --> 28:16.212
and they're coming to our launch party.

28:18.358 --> 28:20.000
I'll be okay, Kiki.

28:20.135 --> 28:21.462
I'm like the Gulf region.

28:21.583 --> 28:24.232
At this point, what's one more hurricane?

28:24.607 --> 28:25.723
I'm telling you it'd work.

28:25.821 --> 28:28.584
We're not starting a rumor that my dad has genital warts.

28:28.701 --> 28:31.374
Hey, Seth, how about lending your mom a hand downstairs?

28:31.471 --> 28:33.950
Actually, uh, Dad, we're kind of busy right now.

28:34.056 --> 28:37.867
We're trying to figure out a way how to break up my dad and some skanked-out ho bag.

28:37.968 --> 28:38.804
Veronica Townsend?

28:38.900 --> 28:39.661
See, everyone knows.

28:39.787 --> 28:44.250
You've got nothing to worry about. It's a long story, but last night's date, one-time thing.

28:44.349 --> 28:46.936
Really, because, I mean, he's bringing her to the party tonight.

28:47.037 --> 28:48.500
He's going on a second date with her?

28:48.796 --> 28:51.272
Oh, Sandy, there you are.

28:51.638 --> 28:54.931
I have to talk to you about Veronica Townsend and you-know-who.

28:55.030 --> 28:55.879
Now we have a quorum.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.218
What happened?

28:57.639 --> 29:00.962
There are factors of which I was not aware when I had you set them up.

29:01.063 --> 29:02.381
Wait, you set them up?

29:02.598 --> 29:05.095
Veronica wanted to go on a date with Summer's dad.

29:05.183 --> 29:08.467
And she threatened to make Marissa's life hell if we didn't set them up.

29:08.615 --> 29:09.704
Neil agreed as a favor.

29:09.797 --> 29:12.379
Look, Neil's a smart guy. If he wants to go on a second date with her,

29:12.475 --> 29:14.304
maybe he sees something in her that we don't.

29:14.395 --> 29:14.918
Huh?

29:15.018 --> 29:16.121
What the hockey?

29:16.222 --> 29:17.452
No, no, no.

29:17.554 --> 29:18.818
Okay, okay, fine.

29:18.909 --> 29:20.938
But we have to make sure that she's the one who ends it.

29:21.024 --> 29:23.530
If Neil starts pulling away, she might take it out on Marissa.

29:23.642 --> 29:26.255
Genital warts is the answer.

29:26.364 --> 29:27.021
Seth!

29:27.128 --> 29:28.311
You've got a dinner to set up.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.739
You two keep working on a plan, I'll keep thinking.

29:30.834 --> 29:31.987
We can do this.

29:33.853 --> 29:36.701
Okay, we got to make Veronica Townsend not want to date your dad,

29:36.791 --> 29:40.853
so tell me the most shameful thing you know about your father.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.374
I'm just not sure which is harder to believe:

29:44.456 --> 29:47.749
that she stole the money or that she paid for some other girl's abortion.

29:47.975 --> 29:49.786
Either way, that girl is not my sister.

29:51.741 --> 29:52.538
I'll get it.

29:57.540 --> 29:59.686
Hey, you brought friends.

29:59.796 --> 30:01.118
Is this the guy who knows where she is?

30:01.234 --> 30:03.247
Hey, look, no one's getting anything. Get out of here.

30:03.342 --> 30:04.359
I'm not going anywhere.

30:04.461 --> 30:08.654
And which are you-- the stalker or his brother who got a 14-year-old girl pregnant?

30:08.895 --> 30:10.775
What the hell is she talking about?

30:10.887 --> 30:13.163
Has anyone seen the cocktail napkins?

30:13.254 --> 30:14.347
Give me my money back, bitch!

30:14.447 --> 30:15.439
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Kaitlin! 

30:15.538 --> 30:17.223
Kaitlin, Kaitlin. Go to the pool house.

30:18.768 --> 30:20.662
Get out of here or we're going to call the cops.

30:20.772 --> 30:22.811
Look, I've been trying to do Kaitlin a favor.

30:23.538 --> 30:25.959
She won't help herself. If you want to call the cops, go ahead.

30:26.045 --> 30:26.630
I'll call them myself.

30:26.719 --> 30:29.298
No, no, no, no. It's fine. Marissa, just go talk to her, please.

30:30.869 --> 30:33.624
Maybe we can settle this. Give them a second, all right?

30:34.755 --> 30:36.792
Kaitlin, these guys are...

30:39.138 --> 30:40.111
Kaitlin?

30:49.077 --> 30:51.405
Looks like she already planned her getaway.

31:00.403 --> 31:01.596
Going somewhere?

31:01.659 --> 31:02.792
Like anyone would notice.

31:02.886 --> 31:04.969
Oh, I think those boys you stole the money from would.

31:05.084 --> 31:06.851
I told you not to tell her.

31:06.963 --> 31:09.465
I knew she was going to act like a self-righteous princess.

31:09.563 --> 31:10.657
You're blaming me?

31:10.766 --> 31:11.764
Hey!

31:12.320 --> 31:14.099
Why don't you two just talk to each other?

31:25.397 --> 31:26.933
You should just let me help you.

31:27.039 --> 31:29.143
Now, I'm supposed to believe that you care?

31:29.611 --> 31:30.528
I do care.

31:30.624 --> 31:35.011
Yeah, that's why I spent the last two Christmases with complete strangers.

31:35.141 --> 31:36.958
Strangers who don't even have a nice tree.

31:37.064 --> 31:39.308
And I want to make that up to you.

31:39.717 --> 31:41.966
But you have to start being more honest.

31:42.064 --> 31:43.855
I have to start being honest?

31:43.971 --> 31:45.379
Look around, Marissa.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.765
You and Mom have been living a giant lie.

31:47.862 --> 31:49.747
Hey, I just found out about the trailer.

31:49.853 --> 31:51.964
Mom said she was renovating a condo.

31:52.061 --> 31:53.623
And you believed her?

31:53.929 --> 31:56.818
My friend Hadley's dad owns this property.

31:56.901 --> 31:58.598
When he heard about his new tenant,

31:58.687 --> 32:01.283
he called me right away 'cause he couldn't believe it.

32:01.377 --> 32:04.404
Julie Cooper Nichol? Isn't that Kaitlin's mom?

32:04.722 --> 32:07.210
Why would she be living in a trailer park?

32:07.442 --> 32:08.829
I can't believe you knew.

32:08.926 --> 32:10.725
My whole school knew.

32:12.368 --> 32:14.977
So, why did you steal the money?

32:15.072 --> 32:17.457
Because I wanted to come back home.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.790
What, to find out if the rumors were true?

32:19.908 --> 32:23.750
No, to make sure that you and Mom were okay.

32:27.967 --> 32:29.449
I'm sorry...

32:30.130 --> 32:32.559
but we really were just trying to spare you.

32:32.653 --> 32:35.736
From what, being a part of this family?

32:38.780 --> 32:39.877
Come here.

32:42.019 --> 32:45.282
Look, if you stick around long enough, you might find out what that's really like.

32:55.928 --> 32:57.101
Ryan?

33:04.271 --> 33:07.000
I only wanted enough for the car to get here.

33:07.217 --> 33:08.692
I'm sorry for all the lies.

33:08.749 --> 33:10.585
I'll tell the cabbie he's not needed.

33:15.252 --> 33:19.740
Well... I guess, unfortunately, you have to go to Mom's launch party.

33:19.846 --> 33:21.997
Only if I can borrow something to wear.

33:31.582 --> 33:32.643
Where is she?

33:32.933 --> 33:34.770
Don't worry, Taylor will be here.

33:35.520 --> 33:37.631
I can't believe I told you that about my Dad.

33:37.763 --> 33:40.599
It does kind of make me see him in a new light.

33:44.622 --> 33:47.125
Uh, hi, everybody. Welcome.

33:47.236 --> 33:48.187
Thanks for coming.

33:48.283 --> 33:49.322
I'm Kirsten Cohen.

33:49.417 --> 33:51.245
And I'm Julie Cooper Nichol.

33:52.093 --> 33:52.836
Thank you.

33:52.966 --> 33:58.458
Uh, well, tonight, we launch Newport's first exclusive dating service, New Match,

33:58.578 --> 34:02.165
because, well, whether you're gay, straight, single,

34:02.283 --> 34:06.679
divorced, nearly divorced, in a world of wealth and luxury,

34:06.766 --> 34:10.523
the only thing really worth pursuing is a soul mate.

34:11.639 --> 34:14.891
So drink up, enjoy and flirt.

34:23.121 --> 34:26.512
If I didn't already have the perfect woman, I would sign right up.

34:26.710 --> 34:27.876
Will you two excuse me?

34:32.036 --> 34:33.167
Don't worry.

34:34.275 --> 34:35.984
The plan is in motion.

34:38.862 --> 34:41.040
Taylor, you're here. Great.

34:41.152 --> 34:42.674
Oh, it's good to see you, too, Seth.

34:42.784 --> 34:43.482
Yeah, so...

34:43.587 --> 34:46.819
Now, don't make a pass at me. I don't want you coming between sisters.

34:46.918 --> 34:47.962
Okay. Come here.

34:55.485 --> 35:00.576
Listen, uh, how serious is your mom about Dr. Roberts?

35:00.788 --> 35:05.652
Well, let's put it this way. When my mom decides she wants something, she gets it.

35:05.773 --> 35:07.386
Like when she wanted my dad, she got him.

35:07.501 --> 35:12.079
And when she wanted all of his money and the house in the divorce, she got that.

35:12.218 --> 35:14.505
And now she wants Dr. Neil Roberts.

35:14.618 --> 35:18.012
Well, there's just something I think you should know about him.

35:37.568 --> 35:39.994
Here it is-- most of it, anyway.

35:40.805 --> 35:41.655
Thanks.

35:42.463 --> 35:44.012
So, uh, where's Kaitlin?

35:44.469 --> 35:46.669
Uh, with her sister. Why?

35:50.529 --> 35:53.425
Why do I get the feeling this isn't just about the money?

35:53.576 --> 35:55.938
Just thought Kaitlin might come by with you.

35:56.892 --> 35:58.549
To apologize or something.

35:58.703 --> 36:00.544
The least she could do is apologize.

36:01.342 --> 36:04.137
So she didn't say anything to you about me at all?

36:04.645 --> 36:05.491
Like...?

36:06.414 --> 36:07.589
I don't know.

36:09.981 --> 36:11.305
You're in love with her.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.202
Maybe I thought I was, but...

36:16.543 --> 36:17.695
But what?

36:18.144 --> 36:20.052
Just be careful of that girl, man.

36:20.736 --> 36:23.469
She's... amazing.

36:25.196 --> 36:25.683
Thanks.

36:28.641 --> 36:31.058
You know, I used to always lie awake, so jealous

36:31.143 --> 36:33.993
that you, Mom and Dad were at one of these things.

36:34.821 --> 36:36.225
A Newport party.

36:36.983 --> 36:38.815
Yeah, well, you're finally here.

36:38.920 --> 36:39.981
Yeah.

36:40.315 --> 36:42.850
Well, what I had in mind was way cooler than this.

36:45.985 --> 36:47.291
Well, how'd it go?

36:49.425 --> 36:50.266
Watch and see.

36:50.362 --> 36:52.973
Neil, maybe we should go somewhere a little bit more private and have a drink.

36:53.093 --> 36:54.489
That sounds like a good idea.

36:54.642 --> 36:58.287
Hi, um, I'm sorry. Mom, could I just talk to you for a second?

36:58.492 --> 37:01.874
Um, Taylor, Dr. Roberts and I are trying to have a private conversation.

37:01.967 --> 37:04.046
This is just gonna take a second, though.

37:04.165 --> 37:05.150
It's okay. Go ahead.

37:10.973 --> 37:11.815
What?

37:12.117 --> 37:13.257
Who told you that?

37:15.533 --> 37:16.622
Is everything okay?

37:16.762 --> 37:20.993
Uh, yeah. Uh, Neil, uh, we'll have to do that drink another time.

37:21.095 --> 37:23.660
Uh, Taylor's not feeling well. Uh, I'll just talk to you later.

37:30.659 --> 37:32.744
- Huh?
- My, God, that is amazing.

37:32.843 --> 37:35.265
All you did was tell her he voted for John Kerry?

37:35.390 --> 37:38.566
Yes, that is exactly what I said.

37:38.879 --> 37:40.666
You told her he had genital warts?!

37:40.773 --> 37:42.916
- That Kerry thing wasn't going to work!
- Come on!

37:45.218 --> 37:46.387
- Neil!
- Hey, Sandy.

37:46.492 --> 37:47.389
You're all alone.

37:47.494 --> 37:50.725
Yes, yes. Veronica's daughter wasn't feeling well.

37:50.833 --> 37:53.326
If you ask me, you dodged a Newpsie bullet.

37:53.515 --> 37:55.019
You're probably right.

37:55.151 --> 37:58.913
I think I've been out of the dating pool so long, I was momentarily polite.

38:00.192 --> 38:02.125
Well, I think it's time for me to be getting home.

38:02.271 --> 38:04.828
I think there's someone here who wouldn't mind your company.

38:19.593 --> 38:20.882
Hey, Kaitlin.

38:21.286 --> 38:22.141
You leaving?

38:22.269 --> 38:23.458
I wish I could.

38:23.786 --> 38:25.478
Party that good, huh?

38:25.915 --> 38:27.935
Just got a little bit more interesting.

38:32.072 --> 38:34.634
I'm going to find Marissa. Excuse me.

38:46.620 --> 38:47.597
Hey, there.

38:48.765 --> 38:49.994
Where's Veronica?

38:50.138 --> 38:51.551
She left.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.306
Alone?

38:55.383 --> 38:56.356
Really?

38:56.934 --> 38:59.316
You two seemed to be getting along so well.

39:00.434 --> 39:03.646
Actually, I was hoping that you might have dinner with me sometime.

39:05.245 --> 39:06.937
Neil, I would love to.

39:08.697 --> 39:09.464
Ryan...

39:10.699 --> 39:12.303
Oh, sorry.

39:12.472 --> 39:13.623
I walked into that.

39:13.724 --> 39:15.912
No, um, what are you doing here?

39:16.004 --> 39:17.912
I'm not staying; I just, um...

39:19.699 --> 39:22.918
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.

39:23.098 --> 39:27.046
I don't know why I said those things when they're not even true.

39:27.665 --> 39:29.669
I guess I just, um...

39:30.723 --> 39:32.024
I missed you.

39:35.832 --> 39:37.583
Apology accepted.

39:38.006 --> 39:39.375
I missed you, too.

39:40.764 --> 39:45.913
Look, I know we both have our own lives now; just... don't be a stranger, okay?

39:47.299 --> 39:49.657
And speaking of strangers, have you seen my sister?

39:49.759 --> 39:51.195
Yeah, she's out front.

39:51.340 --> 39:53.072
Seemed a little bored.

39:53.384 --> 39:56.153
Yeah. You think maybe you could drive her home?

39:56.756 --> 39:57.737
Sure.

39:58.008 --> 40:01.308
Um... I'll take her for ice cream or something.

40:05.672 --> 40:07.399
Of course I didn't mean to hit you.

40:07.510 --> 40:11.255
I know; I just find it interesting how your hand collided with my face.

40:11.454 --> 40:12.409
Summer.

40:13.170 --> 40:14.295
Taylor, I thought you left.

40:14.410 --> 40:16.678
Oh, I did. I told my Mom I had to come back.

40:16.808 --> 40:20.963
Listen, I am so bummed that it didn't work out between our parents, but...

40:21.320 --> 40:25.433
if you don't mind, I would still really like to think of you as my sister.

40:26.135 --> 40:27.338
Yeah, me, too.

40:27.551 --> 40:28.482
Really?

40:29.191 --> 40:30.547
Oh! Okay, that's great.

40:30.642 --> 40:32.402
That makes this all worthwhile.

40:32.540 --> 40:36.258
Okay, so, I got to go, but, um, I'll see you tomorrow in school, sis.

40:36.370 --> 40:37.364
Okay.

40:37.846 --> 40:39.622
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

40:42.903 --> 40:44.641
What, you want another black eye?

40:52.431 --> 40:53.557
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:53.653 --> 40:54.675
How'd it go?

40:54.904 --> 40:56.321
Good, I guess.

40:56.513 --> 40:58.070
Well, was he okay about the money?

40:58.176 --> 41:00.335
I don't think it was the money he was after.

41:00.498 --> 41:01.996
They were seeing each other.

41:02.190 --> 41:03.899
What? You're kidding.

41:04.177 --> 41:05.784
He's, like, our age.

41:05.879 --> 41:07.535
And she lied about hers.

41:09.928 --> 41:13.225
Well, it's not that big of a surprise, I guess.

41:13.329 --> 41:15.218
I kind of feel sorry for the guy.

41:16.803 --> 41:21.801
I mean, you were what, a year older than Kaitlin when I met you?

41:23.370 --> 41:25.713
I know what it's like to fall for a Cooper girl.

41:25.812 --> 41:27.602
Yeah, I guess you do.

41:28.376 --> 41:29.412
Where is she now?

41:29.537 --> 41:34.661
Oh, well, Johnny took her home, so hopefully, by now, she's safe in bed.

41:42.371 --> 41:44.076
Thanks for getting me out of there.

41:44.800 --> 41:45.792
No problem.

41:47.671 --> 41:50.456
You know how people say that you can't go home again?

41:52.377 --> 41:57.018
I'm never sure if that means that the place has changed or you have.

41:59.611 --> 42:00.762
Well, what do you think?

42:00.890 --> 42:03.620
I think this place is exactly the same as I left it.

42:05.712 --> 42:06.657
And you?

42:11.648 --> 42:12.679
Pull over.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.568
- No, we're gonna stop...
- I don't want ice cream.

42:16.895 --> 42:18.588
Just stop the car.

42:27.571 --> 42:29.018
I feel like a swim.

42:29.443 --> 42:30.910
- Now?
- Yeah.

42:33.625 --> 42:36.750
- So... you scared?
- No, but...

42:36.868 --> 42:37.871
Come on!

42:38.306 --> 42:39.357
Kaitlin!

42:40.061 --> 42:41.465
Last one in!

42:41.568 --> 42:42.635
Kaitlin, wait!

42:43.545 --> 42:44.795
Come on!
