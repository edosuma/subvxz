Anyway, look, guys,
now, a while back,

03:36.787 --> 03:39.557
I heard there was a program
that Tuscan Grove sponsored

03:39.592 --> 03:42.021
where they take all
the top managers from franchises

03:42.056 --> 03:44.859
all over the country
on a all-expense paid trip

03:44.894 --> 03:47.763
to the Tuscan Grove
Institute in Italy.

Italian cuisine and culture.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.407
It's a opportunity
of a lifetime.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.508
Now, Amber, you've been here
for nine years.

03:56.543 --> 03:58.609
Matter of fact, I hope
she's here for nine more years.

- Oh, I'm sorry.

12:10.234 --> 12:11.365
I'm so sorry, I forgot.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.005
I'm from Tenafly,
New Jersey.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.810
Please continue.

12:16.845 --> 12:18.405
Did you --
Sorry, no, no.
You can go.

12:18.440 --> 12:23.146
Um, I am really over
the moon to be here.

12:23.181 --> 12:25.214
I feel very connected to all
of you guys already, like,

12:25.249 --> 12:26.545
in this cosmic way.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.316
Like we met in a past life
or something,

12:28.351 --> 12:30.153
and that's, like,
very exciting.

12:30.188 --> 12:33.552
And -- Oh, fun fact about me is,
I used to be a twin.

12:33.587 --> 12:37.831
Uh, almost, because
my sister died in utero.

12:37.866 --> 12:39.195
Cool.

12:39.230 --> 12:41.428
That's not really a fun fact,
but, okay.

12:41.463 --> 12:45.168
Hi, everybody.
My name is Deb.

12:45.203 --> 12:47.137
I lost my bags at the airport,

12:47.172 --> 12:51.306
and I had all these really
important things in my suitcase.

12:51.341 --> 12:53.913
I called this woman with
the airlines and I spoke to her,

12:53.948 --> 12:55.409
and she was very rude to me.

12:55.444 --> 12:57.345
And she has no idea when
I'm gonna get my bags back,

12:57.380 --> 12:58.951
or if they'll ever
find them again.

12:58.986 --> 13:02.416
So, I just feel like
I'm not being very fun.

13:02.451 --> 13:03.615
Mm.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.254
But, um, I really
appreciated Amber.

13:05.289 --> 13:07.157
She was so kind, and you told me

13:07.192 --> 13:09.159
that you could lend me clothes,
and I really appreciate that.

13:09.194 --> 13:10.490
You seem like a nice person.

13:10.525 --> 13:12.360
Thank you.

13:12.395 --> 13:15.198
W-W-Well, I'm Amber.

13:15.233 --> 13:17.937
I'm from Bakersfield,
California.

13:17.972 --> 13:21.974
Um, this is my first time
traveling outside the U.S.

13:22.009 --> 13:25.538
I've worked at Tuscan Grove
for nine years.

13:25.573 --> 13:28.607
I technically took a year off
to open a restaurant, um,

13:28.642 --> 13:30.213
with tablets
at every table,

13:30.248 --> 13:34.382
but my ex put all the debt
on my credit cards

13:34.417 --> 13:36.351
and killed my credit,
and it went under, so I'm back.

13:36.386 --> 13:40.223
And...
now I'm here.

13:40.258 --> 13:42.357
Alright. Well, okay --
Okay, so I'm Susie.

13:42.392 --> 13:43.930
Oh, sorry.
I'm so sorry.

13:43.965 --> 13:46.229
Um, I'm from San Antonio,
Texas, so, "Go, Spurs."

13:46.264 --> 13:47.560
Um, yeah, I don't know --

13:47.595 --> 13:49.265
I've been at Tuscan Grove
for, like, ever --

13:49.300 --> 13:51.938
since I was a little kid, like,
I've been working there.

13:51.973 --> 13:53.137
I mean, not, like,
for real-for real.

13:53.172 --> 13:55.502
Just for fun.
It's not like child labor.

13:55.537 --> 13:58.505
Um, but, like, my parents
and my, like, aunt and uncle,

13:58.540 --> 14:00.309
they all have a franchise,
and they've had it forever.

14:00.344 --> 14:03.114
So, it's like all of us
work there -- my cousins --

14:03.149 --> 14:05.248
There's 23 of us,
like, all together.

14:05.283 --> 14:06.348
We're just,
like, a big family,

14:06.383 --> 14:07.514
but we're all, like,
really close.

14:07.549 --> 14:08.614
They're, like,
my best friends.

14:08.649 --> 14:10.154
Oh, I love family.

14:10.189 --> 14:12.090
Yeah, no,
I mean, family rips.

14:12.125 --> 14:13.586
- Great.

14:13.621 --> 14:15.929
So, now that we got the fun
stuff out of the way,

14:15.964 --> 14:18.998
I gotta --
I have to put on my serious hat.

14:19.033 --> 14:21.033
Italy's a magnificent country,

14:21.068 --> 14:22.628
but, uh,
it can also be dangerous.

14:22.663 --> 14:24.696
That's why we have
a strict curfew.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.501
How is Italy
dangerous, Craig?

14:27.536 --> 14:31.109
Uh, well, you know, there's
a lot of unpaved roads here,

14:31.144 --> 14:32.539
so you could slip and fall.

14:32.574 --> 14:34.409
You could, uh --
You could get lost.

14:34.444 --> 14:36.675
There are boars.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.677
Boars?
Yeah.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.119
There's no leaving the TG
Institute while you're here,

14:41.154 --> 14:44.155
except for official field trips,
which are so fun.

14:44.190 --> 14:47.059
Yeah, okay, now I can take
the serious hat off

14:47.094 --> 14:49.292
and I can put my fun
hat back on

14:49.327 --> 14:51.492
and introduce
a very special guest.

14:51.527 --> 14:54.198
Uh, please welcome one of
the most important members

14:54.233 --> 14:55.397
of the Tuscan Grove family.

14:55.432 --> 14:57.234
She is personally responsible

14:57.269 --> 14:59.632
for designing
the official TG menu.

14:59.667 --> 15:02.173
No way.
Liz Bence is here?

15:02.208 --> 15:03.438
Lizzie Bence.

15:03.473 --> 15:06.309
Oh, holy shit.

15:06.344 --> 15:08.179
Uh, I'm gonna faint.

15:08.214 --> 15:10.643
- Oh, please don't do that.
That's way too much pressure.

15:10.678 --> 15:12.183
Welcome, everyone.

15:12.218 --> 15:14.053
Congratulations
on making the cut.

15:14.088 --> 15:16.385
And speaking of cutting,
you all look hungry.

15:16.420 --> 15:17.683
Let's get to the kitchen.
Come on.

15:17.718 --> 15:19.322
Ooh!

15:20.754 --> 15:22.523
Alright, this is interesting.

15:22.558 --> 15:28.001
What is the different
between a ragu and a Bolognese?

15:28.036 --> 15:29.332
You don't have to
raise your hand.

15:29.367 --> 15:33.732
Sorry, um, a Bolognese
is from Bologne?

15:33.767 --> 15:37.142
Yes. What else?
What else?

15:37.177 --> 15:39.375
Ingredients?

15:39.410 --> 15:42.048
Yes, but, uh, specifically.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.545
Sauce?

15:44.580 --> 15:48.483
Well, you're gonna use a red
wine for ragu and white wine...

15:48.518 --> 15:49.484
Uh, and white wine
for Bolognese.

15:49.519 --> 15:50.617
...for Bolognese.

15:50.652 --> 15:53.125
- That's so interesting.

15:54.557 --> 15:58.130
Ooh, I love this.
This is fun.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.462
Would that look cute?

16:00.497 --> 16:02.101
Yeah, you can take it --
sure.

16:02.136 --> 16:03.630
I think it would be so cute
with my jeans, you know?

16:03.665 --> 16:05.401
Mm-hmm.

16:05.436 --> 16:06.732
Oh, and there's some sweats
to sleep in, if you want.

16:06.767 --> 16:10.340
Thank you so much.
I really like you, Amber.

16:10.375 --> 16:12.738
Yeah. So, do you have
a boyfriend back home?

16:12.773 --> 16:14.575
No, definitely not.

16:14.610 --> 16:16.577
Oh, that's okay.
You're still young, you know?

16:16.612 --> 16:18.117
You got plenty of time.

16:18.152 --> 16:19.514
You should just have fun
while you're here

16:19.549 --> 16:21.681
and sow your wild oats,

16:21.716 --> 16:24.519
'cause that's what
I'm gonna do.

16:24.554 --> 16:26.224
But I'm actually married,
though.

16:26.259 --> 16:27.753
Oh.
My husband, Hank,
is wonderful.

16:27.788 --> 16:29.458
He's --
He's really good for me.

16:29.493 --> 16:32.824
We actually have a really
good relationship -- very solid.

16:32.859 --> 16:35.266
You're gonna find love, Amber.
I can feel it.

16:35.301 --> 16:37.202
A lot of my friends say
I'm really intuitive.

16:37.237 --> 16:39.204
And you're my friend
now, so, mm.

16:40.768 --> 16:43.703
Oh, I just need to get this.
Are you good?

16:43.738 --> 16:45.705
Oh, yeah,
I'll just finish up.

16:49.183 --> 16:50.710
Hi.
<i>Hi!</i>

16:50.745 --> 16:52.844
<i>Oh, my God, how is it?</i>
<i>Tell me everything.</i>

16:52.879 --> 16:54.648
It's r-really great.

16:54.683 --> 16:56.287
<i>"Really great"?</i>
<i>Come on, that's it?</i>

16:56.322 --> 16:58.322
<i>Come on, i-i-is it insane?</i>
<i>How are the people?</i>

16:58.357 --> 16:59.785
<i>Are there any assholes?</i>

16:59.820 --> 17:01.424
<i>Have you hooked up with</i>
<i>anybody? Come on!</i>

17:01.459 --> 17:04.625
Oh, my God,
I've been here one day.

17:04.660 --> 17:05.824
Hold on.

17:05.859 --> 17:08.200
Hey, do you have
everything you need?

17:08.235 --> 17:09.597
Oh, yeah.
This is so cute.

17:09.632 --> 17:11.533
My husband actually loves
when I wear

17:11.568 --> 17:14.470
really revealing
and sexy stuff.

17:14.505 --> 17:16.274
Not that I would ever
do anything while I'm here,

17:16.309 --> 17:17.539
but, you know...

17:17.574 --> 17:19.244
Uh, d-d-d-do you
need anything else?

17:19.279 --> 17:21.114
'Cause I'm just gonna talk
to my friend right now.

17:21.149 --> 17:22.577
No, it's fine.
Oh.

17:22.612 --> 17:24.150
It's actually really good
for my self-esteem, though,

17:24.185 --> 17:26.482
because I love
getting attention from men,

17:26.517 --> 17:29.716
and it's like that kind
of sexual energy, flirty --

17:29.751 --> 17:32.323
Just makes
my body feel good.

17:32.358 --> 17:33.588
And then
you kind of, like,

17:33.623 --> 17:34.787
bring that energy back
to the marriage.

17:34.822 --> 17:37.295
So it's --
it's, like, healthy.

17:37.330 --> 17:39.330
Totally.

17:39.365 --> 17:40.793
S-Sorry, so,

17:40.828 --> 17:43.136
it's just that my friend
is calling long-distance.

17:43.171 --> 17:44.467
Oh, sorry.
Oh, yeah, okay.

17:44.502 --> 17:45.798
Oh, sure, sure.
I'll get out of here.

17:45.833 --> 17:48.867
Okay.
Just want this.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.737
Sorry.
It's okay.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.611
Here.
Let me get my purse.

17:56.646 --> 17:58.316
Would you care
if I take a few hangers?

17:58.351 --> 17:59.746
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:59.781 --> 18:01.814
They didn't put any hangers
in my room, so --

18:01.849 --> 18:04.124
It's so annoying.

18:06.326 --> 18:09.855
This is so cute.
Can I take it?

18:09.890 --> 18:11.230
Ooh, i-it's just
my only jacket.

18:11.265 --> 18:12.330
Oh, okay, no problem.
Okay.

18:12.365 --> 18:14.629
Okay, bye.
Okay, good night.

18:14.664 --> 18:15.894
I'll see you in the van
tomorrow morning.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.665
I'll see you then.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.469
Okay.

18:22.903 --> 18:24.804
Oh, it doesn't lock.
Huh?

18:24.839 --> 18:27.180
It doesn't lock.
You can just open it.

18:27.215 --> 18:28.874
That's so weird.
I know.

18:28.909 --> 18:31.712
Okay.
Good night, Amber.

18:31.747 --> 18:33.417

Yeah -- to eat.
It's the best.

21:41.409 --> 21:42.639
I mean, aren't they supposed
to be, like, really smart?

21:42.674 --> 21:44.069
Yeah, I heard
they're really smart.

21:44.104 --> 21:46.005
- Yeah, supposedly,
they're as smart as dogs.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.578
-So, what?
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.

21:47.613 --> 21:48.843
Craig, I'm so sorry.

21:48.878 --> 21:51.582
Oh, my God,
what's in all those bags?

21:51.617 --> 21:53.980
Well, I bought
some new clothes

21:54.015 --> 21:55.619
so I don't have
to keep wearing yours.

21:55.654 --> 21:57.720
Boom. Let's hit it.
<i>Andiamo.</i>

21:57.755 --> 21:59.590
- Fashion show.

21:59.625 --> 22:03.726
Most of our classic TG
chicken dishes like a Milanese,

22:03.761 --> 22:07.598
a parmigiana, include
traditional Italian seasonings,

22:07.633 --> 22:12.867
which is made up of rosemary,
basil, marjoram, sage, thyme.

22:12.902 --> 22:18.510
But our Crazy Calabrese lasagna
has red pepper flakes, right?

22:18.545 --> 22:21.139
'Cause that gives it that kick
that we all love so much.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.141
Do you wanna, um,
try the marjoram,

22:23.176 --> 22:25.583
or whatever it's called?
Yeah, sure.

22:25.618 --> 22:28.487
When she first said it,
I thought she meant "margarine."

22:28.522 --> 22:29.950
Just 'cause it --
Yeah, me, too.

22:29.985 --> 22:31.490
I was literally like,

22:31.525 --> 22:33.118
"Wait, is margarine
an Italian spice?"

22:33.153 --> 22:35.186
"Yeah, here's this cool
Italian herb.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.925
It's called butter."
-Shh.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.861
Uh...
Sorry.

22:39.896 --> 22:44.195
And, of course,
at our stateside locations,

22:44.230 --> 22:48.738
we exclusively use
the prepackaged...

22:48.773 --> 22:51.642
Ladies. Ladies,
just respect the herbs.

22:51.677 --> 22:53.776
- You know, speaking
of respecting the herbs,

22:53.811 --> 22:55.646
um, do you mind
if I take the stage?

22:55.681 --> 22:57.483
Or the, uh, sage?

22:57.518 --> 22:58.781
Okay.

22:58.816 --> 23:00.783
Listen, gang,
I-I want to apologize

23:00.818 --> 23:03.016
if I've come across as aloof.

23:03.051 --> 23:04.721
I don't know, it's the jet lag
or something.

23:04.756 --> 23:06.954
But I-I want to try to be
more available for you guys.

23:06.989 --> 23:09.154
And -- And, Liz, I love
what you're doing,

23:09.189 --> 23:12.025
but maybe we should try
thinking outside the box.

23:12.060 --> 23:13.697
Let's take bruschetta.

23:13.732 --> 23:16.062
Um, why don't we try
flipping it on its ear?

23:16.097 --> 23:20.000
Do you have a, uh, --
a chinoise for the foam?

23:20.035 --> 23:22.574
And gelatin --
I need to bloom the gelatin.

23:22.609 --> 23:24.642
No, I don't have that.

23:24.677 --> 23:26.138
Okay, well, we can use
some egg whites

23:26.173 --> 23:28.646
to give it some more body.

23:28.681 --> 23:30.912
Beautiful six-pack here.

23:30.947 --> 23:34.047
Where's my plate?
Okay.

23:34.082 --> 23:36.951
Actually, you know what?
We'll just use the whole egg.

23:36.986 --> 23:38.821
Get some of that protein
from the yolk.

23:38.856 --> 23:40.251
Oop, okay.

23:40.286 --> 23:42.088
Get this working here.

23:42.123 --> 23:44.090
And what about some
liquid nitrogen?

23:44.125 --> 23:45.762
Do you have some
some liquid nitrogen here?

23:45.797 --> 23:47.830
It's really not
that kind of kitchen.

23:47.865 --> 23:49.832
Alright, let's use
some milk, then.

23:49.867 --> 23:51.966
And, okay.
We're mixing.

23:52.001 --> 23:55.233
You gotta get a real,
real quick mix going.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.740
-What?
-Is this really happening?

23:56.775 --> 23:58.874
Oh, I know it's, uh --
it's not pretty,

23:58.909 --> 24:00.106
but we're improvising.

24:00.141 --> 24:01.712
We're making it work.

24:01.747 --> 24:03.582
Fran, you maybe want
to stop macerating right now.

24:03.617 --> 24:06.552
I would like to introduce to you
a very special guest.

24:06.587 --> 24:08.917
He is our C.E.O.
and our founder...

24:08.952 --> 24:12.250
Oh, Jesus.
...and my dear,
dear friend.

24:12.285 --> 24:13.955
Nick Martucci.

24:13.990 --> 24:16.727
<i>Ciao, amici!</i>

24:16.762 --> 24:18.663
<i>-Ciao.</i>
-Whoo!

24:18.698 --> 24:19.994
Hey, don't stop on my account.

24:20.029 --> 24:21.600
Oh, okay.

24:21.635 --> 24:23.261
I'm just, uh, whipping up
a little foam here.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.570
More of an emulsion,
actually.

24:24.605 --> 24:26.132
I'm sure it'll be amazing.

24:26.167 --> 24:27.837
Thank you.
Yeah.

24:27.872 --> 24:29.003
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I figured I'd drop in.

24:29.038 --> 24:31.610
Isn't this so cool?

24:31.645 --> 24:33.271
I mean, normally, I'm not here
in the off-season,

24:33.306 --> 24:36.681
but I figured, for this group,
I'd make an exception.

24:37.651 --> 24:40.080
Oh, hey.
Hey, Nick.

24:40.115 --> 24:41.279
What's up?
I'm Susie.

24:41.314 --> 24:42.621
Susie?
Mm-hmm.

24:42.656 --> 24:45.019
That's a beautiful name.
Alright.

24:47.221 --> 24:50.695
I'm Nick.
I'm -- I'm Jen.

24:50.730 --> 24:52.224
Your name is Nick.

24:55.229 --> 24:56.261
Hi, Nick.

24:56.296 --> 24:58.263
You have exquisite hands.

24:58.298 --> 24:59.935
Thank you.

25:01.301 --> 25:03.873
Uh...

25:03.908 --> 25:06.271
I-I love you.

25:07.274 --> 25:08.647
Thank you.

25:11.685 --> 25:13.344
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:13.379 --> 25:14.818
No, it's an honest mistake.

25:14.853 --> 25:15.885
I've never been
to Europe before.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.623
No need to apologize.

25:20.958 --> 25:23.926
She looks so much
like Connie, huh?

25:23.961 --> 25:26.698
I'm Amber.

25:26.733 --> 25:27.930
Well, it's nice
to meet you.

25:27.965 --> 25:29.998
Hey, Amber.
Hey.

25:30.033 --> 25:31.670
I'm, uh, Fran.

25:31.705 --> 25:34.200
Thank you all for coming
all the way over here.

25:34.235 --> 25:35.674
We're so appreciative
of everything

25:35.709 --> 25:37.236
that you've done for our family.

25:37.271 --> 25:39.040
Turns out, I'm gonna be around
a little bit this week,

25:39.075 --> 25:41.911
so I'm excited to get to know
you a little better.

25:41.946 --> 25:43.341
This is my assistant, Kat.

25:43.376 --> 25:45.651
If you need anything,
feel free to approach her

25:45.686 --> 25:46.949
and let her know.

25:46.984 --> 25:48.621
She handles all my business.

25:48.656 --> 25:50.623
How about a group shot?

25:50.658 --> 25:51.723
Yeah, let's do it.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.659
Come on.
-Yes.

25:53.694 --> 25:54.858
-Gnocchi.
-Gnocchi.

25:56.158 --> 25:59.027
Okay, everyone say "formaggi."

25:59.062 --> 26:01.194
-Formaggi.
-Formaggi.

26:01.229 --> 26:03.900
Mwah.<i> Bene.</i>

26:03.935 --> 26:05.968
Okay, now, if you'll excuse me,

26:06.003 --> 26:07.838
I'm gonna catch up
with you guys in the A.M.

26:07.873 --> 26:09.906
-Alright.
-Thank you, Nick.

26:09.941 --> 26:11.776
Bye.

26:11.811 --> 26:14.713
- Ooh, well...

26:14.748 --> 26:16.308
That was a lot, huh?

26:16.343 --> 26:18.145
Is everybody okay?

26:18.180 --> 26:20.279
So, Nick.

26:20.314 --> 26:21.786
Boy, he was definitely

26:21.821 --> 26:23.117
feeling a little
something extra, hmm?

26:23.152 --> 26:25.988
-Well, I --
-Ah.

26:26.023 --> 26:28.254
- Oh.
Who's Connie?

26:28.289 --> 26:29.420
I don't know.

26:29.455 --> 26:31.224
I kissed him
right on the lips.

26:31.259 --> 26:32.390
You did.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.029
Hey, you're Amber, right?
Yeah.

26:34.064 --> 26:37.230
Cool. Do you want
to take a smoke break?

26:37.265 --> 26:39.705
Oh, um --
Just come with me.

26:42.072 --> 26:43.401
Okay.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.370
- Now, um, one of the things
that is --

26:45.405 --> 26:46.844
There you go.

26:46.879 --> 26:48.846
That I love about
the red pepper is that --

26:53.787 --> 26:55.952
Oh, I don't really smoke.

26:55.987 --> 26:58.020
Don't inhale, then.

26:58.055 --> 26:59.758
Okay.

27:08.395 --> 27:10.032
I t--
I only ever smoked

27:10.067 --> 27:12.199
for, like,
two weeks in high school,

27:12.234 --> 27:14.971
and I smoked cloves
'cause I thought it was so cool.

27:15.006 --> 27:16.808
And I would just, like,
drive around in my car

27:16.843 --> 27:18.271
with my cigarette
hanging out the window

27:18.306 --> 27:20.174
but, like, so nauseous.

27:20.209 --> 27:22.044
And then, my mom found
the cigarettes in my purse

27:22.079 --> 27:23.749
and, like, asked
if I was smoking.

27:23.784 --> 27:26.246
And I said no, and then I just,
like, burst into tears.

27:26.281 --> 27:28.446
I felt so bad about lying.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.019
Just --
That's cool.

27:31.957 --> 27:34.727
Me crying is cool?

27:34.762 --> 27:36.421
No, sorry.

27:36.456 --> 27:38.863
I'm just kind of out of it
right now.

27:38.898 --> 27:40.161
Oh, from traveling.

27:40.196 --> 27:43.802
No. Nope, all we
fuckin' do is travel.

27:43.837 --> 27:45.771
Yeah, like, I can't even
remember the last time

27:45.806 --> 27:47.806
we were in one place
for more than a week.

27:47.841 --> 27:49.775
That sounds fun.

27:49.810 --> 27:50.941
Yeah, it can be.

27:50.976 --> 27:54.879
It can also suck --
majorly.

27:56.949 --> 27:58.949
I'm sorry, I'm, like,
dumping all my shit on you,

27:58.984 --> 28:00.148
and we just met.

28:00.183 --> 28:03.118
Oh, my God,
you can dump shit on me.

28:03.153 --> 28:04.823
Yeah?

28:09.489 --> 28:11.126
What are you doing
tonight?

28:11.161 --> 28:12.930
Do you have plans?

28:12.965 --> 28:14.426
No.
I mean, I don't know.

28:14.461 --> 28:16.835
I don't think we're allowed to,
like, plan our own stuff.

28:16.870 --> 28:19.970
No, fuck that.
You're with me.

28:20.005 --> 28:22.808
I actually know this really
cool spot in Lucca.

28:22.843 --> 28:24.040
Okay, great.

28:24.075 --> 28:27.043
I wanna go to a cool spot
in Lucca.

28:27.078 --> 28:29.342
Plus, Craig says we should
all stick together, right?

28:31.214 --> 28:33.984
Can I bum a square?

28:34.019 --> 28:35.183
- Here we go --
first one.

28:35.218 --> 28:36.789
Okay.
There we go.

28:36.824 --> 28:38.516
Uh...

28:38.551 --> 28:39.858
Marjoram?

28:39.893 --> 28:41.519
No.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.059
Mint?

28:43.094 --> 28:45.193
No.

28:45.228 --> 28:47.360
Pine?
Mm, no.

28:47.395 --> 28:50.165
Hey, everybody.

28:50.200 --> 28:54.103
Amber, Kat, and I are gonna go
to a really cool bar in Lucca

28:54.138 --> 28:56.006
tonight if anybody wants
to come with us.

28:56.041 --> 28:58.877
Okay, no.
That's not gonna happen.

28:58.912 --> 29:01.473
So, to be crystal clear,
none of us are going to leave

29:01.508 --> 29:05.081
the TG campus except the --
Oh, Craig, it'll be fun!

29:05.116 --> 29:07.578
You gotta live
a little, baby.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.888
-I'm trying to go.
-Uh, no.

29:09.923 --> 29:11.516
It's the birth place
of Puccini.

29:11.551 --> 29:14.123
Deb.
Deb, that's not permitted.

29:14.158 --> 29:15.553
What's not permitted?

29:15.588 --> 29:16.829
Smoking.

29:16.864 --> 29:19.326
What?

29:19.361 --> 29:22.131
Deb?
Put it out.

29:22.166 --> 29:24.265
Oh, my God, so serious.

29:24.300 --> 29:27.136
Craig, we're in Europe,
if you didn't know,

29:27.171 --> 29:31.107
and you need to lighten up
a little bit, please.

29:31.142 --> 29:33.175
This is a working kitchen.

29:33.210 --> 29:35.573
Put it out.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.311
Fine.

29:41.383 --> 29:43.548
-Cool, so, Lucca?
-Yeah, can we go?

29:43.583 --> 29:46.287
Alright, guys,
I'll make you a deal.

29:46.322 --> 29:47.585
We can go...
-Yes!

29:47.620 --> 29:49.191
-Yes!
-Let's go.

29:49.226 --> 29:50.995
...to the bar right here.
What the fuck, Craig?

29:51.030 --> 29:52.931
What kind of deal
is that, Craig?

29:52.966 --> 29:54.966
I don't know what to tell you.
We're not going to Lucca.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.330
Them's the rules, alright?

29:56.365 --> 29:57.903
I brought some molly,

29:57.938 --> 29:59.003
and Jen and I
are gonna roll tonight.

29:59.038 --> 30:00.400
I don't know
if you wanna...

30:00.435 --> 30:01.500
We'll just see.
Okay.

30:01.535 --> 30:03.007
Yeah, no pressure.

30:03.042 --> 30:05.537
What are you guys
talking about?

30:09.983 --> 30:11.884
Oh, my God, look at them.

30:11.919 --> 30:13.446
...my eyes.

30:13.481 --> 30:16.548
We have the same face!

30:16.583 --> 30:20.321
Ugh, they are
so annoying.

30:20.356 --> 30:22.026
It's so depressing.

30:22.061 --> 30:23.522
When I first got to Italy,

30:23.557 --> 30:25.359
I had men that were, like,
chasing me down the streets.

30:25.394 --> 30:27.295
You know, th-they would --
they would cat-call me.

30:27.330 --> 30:28.560
They -- They would just,
like, reach out

30:28.595 --> 30:30.529
and take big ol' handfuls
of my ass.

30:30.564 --> 30:32.102
Oh, no.

30:32.137 --> 30:33.598
No, it was great.
It was great.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.976
I walk down the street now,
I'm completely invisible.

30:38.011 --> 30:40.011
People, like, settin' drinks
on my head like I'm a table.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.606
I don't even get whistled
at anymore.

30:41.641 --> 30:43.509

Mm...

31:19.514 --> 31:23.252
been so many places.

31:23.287 --> 31:25.991
Oh, this one time, I was living
abroad in the Andes,

31:26.026 --> 31:29.225
and I hiked up the cape
to Pachamama high on coca.

31:29.260 --> 31:30.721
Coca?

31:30.756 --> 31:33.163
Yeah, you need the coca
to survive the<i> soroche.</i>

31:33.198 --> 31:34.725
What's that?
Altitude sickness.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.166
We were at 3,200 meters,

31:36.201 --> 31:38.036
so you definitely
need the coca.

31:38.071 --> 31:39.499

the solstice, right?

31:39.534 --> 31:41.501

out of the entire year

31:43.406 --> 31:45.373

31:45.408 --> 31:47.606

Latin American kick.

31:56.386 --> 31:57.649

all these people

31:57.684 --> 31:59.453

by Pablo Escobar.

31:59.488 --> 32:01.224

love is supposed to be

42:12.265 --> 42:14.771
Hey, listen, um,
my friend Ricky's

42:14.806 --> 42:16.938
having this
little party tomorrow night.

42:16.973 --> 42:20.337
He's a sculptor --
super talented.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.812
Maybe you'd want to join?

42:22.847 --> 42:25.078
If it's not too much.

42:25.113 --> 42:26.343
No, yeah.

42:26.378 --> 42:28.851
Amazing.
I-I'd love to.

42:28.886 --> 42:30.952
Great.

42:30.987 --> 42:32.690
So...

42:32.725 --> 42:34.989
it's a date?

42:35.024 --> 42:36.661
Yes.

42:36.696 --> 42:38.157
Great.

42:47.234 --> 42:48.805
Oh, wait, one more thing.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.367
It's probably best if we
keep this to ourselves,

42:50.402 --> 42:51.940
'cause I don't want
the other managers

42:51.975 --> 42:54.239
thinking you're getting
special treatment.

42:54.274 --> 42:55.372
Of course.

42:55.407 --> 42:57.011
Okay.

42:59.917 --> 43:02.181
Oh.

43:02.216 --> 43:04.788
That was so amazing.
I can't even believe it.

43:04.823 --> 43:06.284
Yeah.

43:06.319 --> 43:09.694
Just make sure to keep it
on the DL.

43:09.729 --> 43:11.223
Right.
Totally.

43:15.394 --> 43:18.263
Yeah, and he, like, asked me
all these intimate questions,

43:18.298 --> 43:19.935
and he really
opened up to me

43:19.970 --> 43:22.135
about his family
and his pain.

43:22.170 --> 43:23.301
<i>Wait, wait, his pain?</i>

43:23.336 --> 43:24.874
Yes, it was crazy.

43:24.909 --> 43:26.744
Like, don't tell anyone,

43:26.779 --> 43:30.209
but he told me about his sister
who died, and then we kissed.

43:30.244 --> 43:31.848
And then, he invited me
to this artist party

43:31.883 --> 43:33.245
tomorrow night as his date.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.884
<i>Wait, what the fuck?</i>

43:34.919 --> 43:36.853
<i>So you're just, like,</i>
<i>riding on yachts</i>

43:36.888 --> 43:38.085
<i>and you're, like,</i>
<i>his girlfriend now?</i>

43:38.120 --> 43:40.450
Okay, no,
I'm not his girlfriend.

43:40.485 --> 43:42.386
We just had
an amazing day.

43:42.421 --> 43:44.256
<i>Oh, my God, is he</i>
<i>as hot in person?</i>

43:44.291 --> 43:45.895
Um, yeah.

43:45.930 --> 43:47.732
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>I'm so jealous of you.</i>

43:47.767 --> 43:49.459
<i>You're just gonna be, like,</i>
<i>flying all over the world</i>

43:49.494 --> 43:51.131
<i>with your rich boyfriend,</i>

43:51.166 --> 43:53.199
<i>meeting famous artists</i>
<i>on yachts and shit.</i>

43:53.234 --> 43:54.904
<i>I told you this shit</i>
<i>was gonna happen.</i>

43:54.939 --> 43:56.169
He's not my boyfriend.

43:56.204 --> 43:57.973
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>that's your boyfriend.</i>

44:00.076 --> 44:01.977
How is that, Jen?

44:02.012 --> 44:04.474
It's a little hard.

44:04.509 --> 44:07.180
Well, that's what we refer
to as al dente.

44:07.215 --> 44:09.919
It's actually the ideal
texture and doneness.

44:09.954 --> 44:12.449
It's actually kind of gross,
this texture.

44:12.484 --> 44:15.056
Yeah, it's really gross.
It's just, like, too bouncy.

44:15.091 --> 44:16.860
But it's ideal.

44:16.895 --> 44:17.960
Yeah, like, it's supposed
to be mushier.

44:17.995 --> 44:19.764
Warm cat food
or something.

44:19.799 --> 44:22.030
Yeah, like, right.
Well, not like -- It's like --

44:22.065 --> 44:24.428
You know when you chew or eat,
like, an eraser,

44:24.463 --> 44:25.836
it kind of tastes like --
Yeah.

44:25.871 --> 44:27.233

like this?

that migraine?

44:40.853 --> 44:42.116
Oh, yeah.

44:42.151 --> 44:44.250
I-I do.

44:44.285 --> 44:46.450
Okay, hmm.

44:46.485 --> 44:50.223

1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:51.390

- Boy, they're really
dropping like flies, huh?

1:05:04.174 --> 1:05:05.536
Hey, maybe we should go
whip up

1:05:05.571 --> 1:05:07.274
some wellness shots
or something, you know?

1:05:07.309 --> 1:05:10.013
Like, in the kitchen?
Like, make something, Craig?

1:05:10.048 --> 1:05:11.410
Can I talk to you
outside for a second?

1:05:11.445 --> 1:05:13.379

to kill some time?

1:05:13.414 --> 1:05:14.985
Okay.

1:05:15.020 --> 1:05:16.415
This is some substitute
teacher bullshit, Craig.

1:05:19.288 --> 1:05:21.255
Here.
Oh, I-I don't really smoke.

1:05:21.290 --> 1:05:22.487
It was subterfuge.

1:05:22.522 --> 1:05:24.126
Just don't inhale.

1:05:24.161 --> 1:05:26.260
Okay, um...

1:05:26.295 --> 1:05:28.493
Listen...

1:05:28.528 --> 1:05:31.463
I think something weird
might be going on.

1:05:31.498 --> 1:05:33.168
What do you mean?

1:05:33.203 --> 1:05:35.533
Well, don't you think
it's weird that Liz Bence

1:05:35.568 --> 1:05:38.602
suddenly disappeared
with no explanation?

1:05:38.637 --> 1:05:40.703
I guess.
Is it weird?

1:05:40.738 --> 1:05:43.079
And then, like, we haven't
seen Susie in two days.

1:05:43.114 --> 1:05:46.478
And, like, Jen is suddenly
acting so strange,

1:05:46.513 --> 1:05:48.084
and she's not feeling well.

1:05:48.119 --> 1:05:50.218
Like, you had a bad migraine
for two days,

1:05:50.253 --> 1:05:51.582
and I looked it up,
'cause I was worried.

1:05:51.617 --> 1:05:53.452
And --
And I found, normally,

1:05:53.487 --> 1:05:55.157
they only last
for four hours.

1:05:55.192 --> 1:05:56.719
Why are all the women
in this program

1:05:56.754 --> 1:05:58.259
suddenly getting sick?

1:05:58.294 --> 1:06:01.097
I mean, have you talked
to Deb recently?

1:06:01.132 --> 1:06:03.627
Something is definitely
going on with her.

1:06:03.662 --> 1:06:07.136
So, maybe
it wasn't a migraine.

1:06:07.171 --> 1:06:08.500
Maybe it was
something else.

1:06:08.535 --> 1:06:09.798
Like what?

1:06:09.833 --> 1:06:11.239
Poison.

1:06:11.274 --> 1:06:13.406
Poison?
Think about it.

1:06:13.441 --> 1:06:14.737
Liz Bence was making
all our food, right?

1:06:14.772 --> 1:06:16.739
Mm-hmm.
Then, she disappears.

1:06:16.774 --> 1:06:18.774
All of a sudden,
all of the women in the program

1:06:18.809 --> 1:06:20.512
are dropping like flies.

1:06:20.547 --> 1:06:22.613
Okay, I didn't actually
have a migraine.

1:06:22.648 --> 1:06:23.647
That was just something
I said to cover

1:06:23.682 --> 1:06:25.055
what was really going on.

1:06:25.090 --> 1:06:28.685
Okay, well, what was
really going on?

1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:30.093
Remember Kat?

1:06:30.128 --> 1:06:31.556
Nick's assistant?
Of course.

1:06:31.591 --> 1:06:34.361
Well, she secretly took me
to Nick's boat.

1:06:34.396 --> 1:06:35.659
What?
Yeah.

1:06:35.694 --> 1:06:37.100
She, like, made up
this whole scenario

1:06:37.135 --> 1:06:38.365
so I could spend
the day with Nick,

1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:39.828
and we went out
on his huge yacht.

1:06:39.863 --> 1:06:41.665
And, like, then she drove me
back here afterwards,

1:06:41.700 --> 1:06:43.403
and they both told me
not to tell anybody.

1:06:43.438 --> 1:06:46.274
But, like,
Kat is kinda sketchy.

1:06:46.309 --> 1:06:48.408
Like, she and Nick have
a super volatile relationship.

1:06:48.443 --> 1:06:50.410
Like,
she kind of hates him.

1:06:50.445 --> 1:06:53.380
You spent the day on Nick's
yacht, just the two of you?

1:06:53.415 --> 1:06:54.810
Y-Yeah, and --
and what I'm saying is...

1:06:54.845 --> 1:06:57.516
Wow. Yeah.
...Kat...

1:06:57.551 --> 1:06:59.287
Yeah, yeah, that's fun.

1:06:59.322 --> 1:07:00.453
A boat day, that's cool.

1:07:00.488 --> 1:07:01.850
Okay, Dana?
Listen to me.

1:07:01.885 --> 1:07:04.688
What I'm trying to say is
that Kat is kind of shady.

1:07:04.723 --> 1:07:07.163
The next time I saw Nick --
Wait, you saw Nick again?

1:07:07.198 --> 1:07:08.824
Yes, and she was supposed
to bring me right back here

1:07:08.859 --> 1:07:10.232
afterward, and instead,
she took me to Lucca.

1:07:10.267 --> 1:07:11.662
Birthplace of Puccini.

1:07:11.697 --> 1:07:13.433
And then, just yesterday,
I saw her taking Susie away.

1:07:13.468 --> 1:07:15.468
And she got back last night,
and Susie was gone.

1:07:15.503 --> 1:07:17.272
And she left me some book
about kidnapping.

1:07:17.307 --> 1:07:19.175
I'm just saying, if something
sketchy is going on here,

1:07:19.210 --> 1:07:21.144
maybe Kat has something
to do with it.

1:07:27.284 --> 1:07:28.745
Hey, uh, Craig.

1:07:28.780 --> 1:07:32.452

to the bathroom so bad.

1:07:32.487 --> 1:07:34.586
Uh, is it okay if I go
to the bathroom?

1:07:34.621 --> 1:07:35.884
'Cause I gotta go so bad.

Yeah.

Okay, yeah.
No, that's --

this whole time.

1:08:55.966 --> 1:08:58.736
Like -- Like, she was jealous
of him and me.

1:08:58.771 --> 1:09:01.673
Maybe we -- we were ruining
her whole plan.

1:09:01.708 --> 1:09:02.971
But jealous about what?

1:09:03.006 --> 1:09:04.412
Him and I making
out and stuff.

1:09:04.447 --> 1:09:05.644
She saw it when
she picked me up.

1:09:05.679 --> 1:09:07.679
Wait, you made out
with Nick, too?

1:09:07.714 --> 1:09:11.386

so different?

1:09:11.421 --> 1:09:12.915
Wait a second.

1:09:12.950 --> 1:09:16.424
I just thought
of something.

1:09:16.459 --> 1:09:19.922
Fran and I both have
unisex names.

1:09:19.957 --> 1:09:22.562
They thought
we were women, too.

1:09:22.597 --> 1:09:25.565
And that is why Nick
was so weird

1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:27.534
when we first met,
right?

1:09:27.569 --> 1:09:29.338
It's not just Kat --
it's Nick, too.

1:09:29.373 --> 1:09:30.537
No, no, no, no, no.

1:09:30.572 --> 1:09:32.341
I-I don't think it is Nick.

1:09:32.376 --> 1:09:34.904
Like, I haven't even seen Nick
with any other women --

1:09:34.939 --> 1:09:36.279
only Kat.

1:09:36.314 --> 1:09:37.643
And Kat, she's been, like,

1:09:37.678 --> 1:09:39.711
steering me to suspect him
this whole time.

1:09:39.746 --> 1:09:41.548
Right.
Kat's the poisoner.

1:09:41.583 --> 1:09:43.253
No, I don't think
there's poison.

1:09:43.288 --> 1:09:44.815
I don't thi--

1:09:44.850 --> 1:09:46.289
I feel like we moved on
from the poison thing.

1:09:46.324 --> 1:09:48.016
I think that Kat

1:09:48.051 --> 1:09:50.590
has developed
this whole program to,

1:09:50.625 --> 1:09:52.394

I don't know.

1:09:53.727 --> 1:09:55.364
I mean, Nick is super rich.

1:09:55.399 --> 1:09:56.794
He oversees everything
about the program.

1:09:56.829 --> 1:09:58.367
There's no way something
like this could happen

What? When?

1:14:00.611 --> 1:14:02.105
What does that mean?

1:14:02.140 --> 1:14:03.876
Like, the other day
on the boat,

1:14:03.911 --> 1:14:06.109
he was asking me all these
intimate questions, and --

1:14:06.144 --> 1:14:09.783
and I told him some --
some really private stuff.

1:14:09.818 --> 1:14:11.818
I'm such a fucking idiot.

1:14:11.853 --> 1:14:13.721
Whoa.
Like, what private stuff?

1:14:13.756 --> 1:14:14.953
It's private.

1:14:14.988 --> 1:14:16.559
Sorry.

1:14:16.594 --> 1:14:17.791
But, like,
it was really weird,

1:14:17.826 --> 1:14:19.155
because it started out
super simply.

1:14:19.190 --> 1:14:20.596
Like, "If you could be famous,
would you?"

1:14:20.631 --> 1:14:22.158
But then, he got into shit
about, like,

1:14:22.193 --> 1:14:23.291
"What roles do love and
affection play in your life?"

1:14:23.326 --> 1:14:24.732
Like, who even talks
like that?

1:14:24.767 --> 1:14:27.570
When did you last sing

1:14:27.605 --> 1:14:28.670

Nick is the mastermind.

1:14:42.015 --> 1:14:43.586
Okay, we gotta get the fuck
out of here.

1:14:43.621 --> 1:14:46.655
Right. Well,
Craig has our passports.

1:14:57.063 --> 1:14:58.997
We're American citizens,
and so we have a right

1:14:59.032 --> 1:15:02.066
to demand
our passports back now.

1:15:02.101 --> 1:15:04.574
And so,
we do demand that.

1:15:04.609 --> 1:15:07.236
Furthermore, we want
to be flown out of here --

1:15:07.271 --> 1:15:09.106
t-tonight, now.

1:15:09.141 --> 1:15:13.682
Uh, well, yeah, that's --
that's not gonna happen.

1:15:13.717 --> 1:15:15.618
Look, we know there's
something shady going on,

1:15:15.653 --> 1:15:17.620
and we just want
to leave quietly.

1:15:17.655 --> 1:15:20.590
So, just give us our passports,
and we won't report

1:15:20.625 --> 1:15:22.658
any of this --
Wait, what?

1:15:22.693 --> 1:15:23.923

1:15:23.958 --> 1:15:26.893

once again

1:16:18.144 --> 1:16:19.847
for showing "Life is Beautiful."

1:16:19.882 --> 1:16:21.783
Uh, my bad.

1:16:21.818 --> 1:16:24.984
I'll be reading the synopses
from here on out.

1:16:25.019 --> 1:16:29.054
I'd also like to, uh,
remind everyone that

1:16:29.089 --> 1:16:31.958
you're very lucky to be here,
and you should be

1:16:31.993 --> 1:16:34.862
very appreciative
of this opportunity.

1:16:34.897 --> 1:16:39.031
So, keep it professional
and positive, okay?

1:16:39.066 --> 1:16:40.703
So, in that spirit, let's do

1:16:40.738 --> 1:16:42.870
some trust-building
exercises today.

1:16:42.905 --> 1:16:44.938
This one's called
"Pass the Zuke."

1:16:44.973 --> 1:16:48.106
Uh, share something personal
about yourselves, uh,

1:16:48.141 --> 1:16:50.845
perhaps something you learned
on this trip. I'll start.

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:52.880
Um, I got
a better idea, Craig.

1:16:52.915 --> 1:16:54.849
We should play Mafia.

1:16:54.884 --> 1:16:58.688
It's really fun and it's
a great way to build trust.

1:16:58.723 --> 1:17:00.690
Alright, so, I'm gonna hand
out these little cards.

1:17:00.725 --> 1:17:02.417
They're gonna tell you
if you are a villager

1:17:02.452 --> 1:17:05.156
or a member of the Mafia.

1:17:05.191 --> 1:17:06.795
And then we're all
gonna close our eyes.

1:17:06.830 --> 1:17:09.864
Mafia members will open them,
make eye contact,

1:17:09.899 --> 1:17:12.064
and carefully choose
someone to kill.

1:17:12.099 --> 1:17:13.296
- Hey, Nick.

1:17:13.331 --> 1:17:16.431
-Hey, Nick.
<i>-Ciao, amici.</i>

1:17:16.466 --> 1:17:19.170
Amber, could we have
a word outside, please?

1:17:19.205 --> 1:17:22.173
I'm good.
She's good.

1:17:22.208 --> 1:17:24.780
Hey, uh,
you want to play, Nick?

1:17:24.815 --> 1:17:26.947
Uh, okay.

1:17:26.982 --> 1:17:29.312
Sure.
What's the game?

1:17:29.347 --> 1:17:32.183
Mafia.
Great.

1:17:32.218 --> 1:17:33.855
-Awesome.
-Unreal.

1:17:33.890 --> 1:17:36.792
Okay.
Shuffle these boys up.

1:17:36.827 --> 1:17:38.860
Keep those close
to the vest.

1:17:38.895 --> 1:17:40.323
Don't let anyone know
who you are.

1:17:40.358 --> 1:17:42.259
Do you understand
the game, Deb?

1:17:42.294 --> 1:17:45.262
- Yes. I think I do.
Here you go, my don.

1:17:47.299 --> 1:17:49.904
Okay, everybody.
It's morningtime.

1:17:49.939 --> 1:17:52.434
The sun is rising.
The birds are chirping.

1:17:52.469 --> 1:17:54.810
You just had a restful sleep.

1:17:54.845 --> 1:17:58.044
And in a second, everyone's
gonna open their eyes,

1:17:58.079 --> 1:18:01.311
except for Dana.

1:18:01.346 --> 1:18:03.049
Dana, you're dead, bro.

1:18:03.084 --> 1:18:04.116
Okay.

1:18:04.151 --> 1:18:06.217
Well, obviously,
it was Nick.

1:18:06.252 --> 1:18:09.924
Right?
What'd you do with them?

1:18:09.959 --> 1:18:11.486
Who?
Wait. Dana, you're not
allowed to talk.

1:18:11.521 --> 1:18:12.927
You're dead.

1:18:12.962 --> 1:18:14.159
Why would you think
that I did it?

1:18:14.194 --> 1:18:15.864
Well, because
you know I know.

1:18:15.899 --> 1:18:17.932
I mean, it's so obvious.

1:18:17.967 --> 1:18:19.868
Know what, Dana?

1:18:19.903 --> 1:18:22.233
Dana,
zip it up, dude, okay?

1:18:22.268 --> 1:18:24.400
Were you Mafia
or were you a villager?

1:18:24.435 --> 1:18:26.974
Yeah, maybe play it cool.
No, no.

1:18:27.009 --> 1:18:29.108
He makes himself out to be
this amazing guy, right?

1:18:29.143 --> 1:18:31.946
Mm-hmm.
With this amazing family.

1:18:31.981 --> 1:18:33.376
And that
bringing all of us here

1:18:33.411 --> 1:18:35.114
will let us be
a part of that.

1:18:35.149 --> 1:18:37.215
And, instead,
he just totally snubs me,

1:18:37.250 --> 1:18:40.889
and this program sucks!

1:18:40.924 --> 1:18:43.089
It sucks.
I'm sorry.

1:18:43.124 --> 1:18:45.058
You just fly a bunch
of white people out here.

1:18:45.093 --> 1:18:46.554
You make a Bolognese.

1:18:46.589 --> 1:18:50.195
You watch moves in this
dilapidated, low-rent shithole.

1:18:50.230 --> 1:18:51.999
You have no other plan.

1:18:52.034 --> 1:18:55.266
I hear trains go by
every fucking three seconds.

1:18:55.301 --> 1:18:58.434
My room has silverfish in it,
and they really scare me,

1:18:58.469 --> 1:18:59.974
but I don't want
to kill them,

1:19:00.009 --> 1:19:02.273
so I'm just living
with fucking silverfish?!

1:19:02.308 --> 1:19:03.879
Fuck this!

1:19:03.914 --> 1:19:05.210
I'm Persian.

1:19:05.245 --> 1:19:06.508
Okay.
I'm sorry.

1:19:06.543 --> 1:19:08.444
But where is everyone
disappearing to?

1:19:08.479 --> 1:19:10.380
Nick,
are you poisoning them?

1:19:10.415 --> 1:19:13.152
-Whoa! Stop it.
-You're being a dick, Dana.

1:19:13.187 --> 1:19:15.385
No, no, no.
It's okay.

1:19:17.455 --> 1:19:19.224
You want to talk
about family?

1:19:21.228 --> 1:19:23.129
You ever held your sister's hand
as she died

1:19:23.164 --> 1:19:24.460
right in front of you?
No, I haven't.

1:19:24.495 --> 1:19:26.297
That would be
an incredible coincidence.

1:19:26.332 --> 1:19:27.496
I have.

1:19:27.531 --> 1:19:30.499
Connie --

1:19:33.438 --> 1:19:36.472
Connie was my everything.

1:19:36.507 --> 1:19:39.046
I mean, this isn't
what I signed up for.

1:19:39.081 --> 1:19:42.445
Tuscan Grove was supposed to be
a fine-dining experience,

1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:44.414
so I didn't know
it was gonna snowball

1:19:44.449 --> 1:19:46.614
into some fucking populist,
mass-produced,

1:19:46.649 --> 1:19:49.023
fucking fast-food bullshit.

1:19:49.058 --> 1:19:52.323
It was supposed
to be my Spago,

1:19:52.358 --> 1:19:54.589
my Chez Panisse.

1:19:54.624 --> 1:19:56.294
I've accepted what
it's become --

1:19:56.329 --> 1:19:58.098
a massive success.
Great.

1:19:58.133 --> 1:20:02.971
And now I try and create
a beautiful experience

1:20:03.006 --> 1:20:06.007
for all of you,
inviting...

1:20:06.042 --> 1:20:08.504
you into my home...

1:20:10.145 --> 1:20:13.949
...my villa, my...
my life.

1:20:13.984 --> 1:20:16.985
And you have the nerve
to accuse me?

1:20:20.551 --> 1:20:24.553
I-I really put my heart
on the line this time.

1:20:26.326 --> 1:20:28.964
Never again.

1:20:47.182 --> 1:20:49.248
It hurt -- it hurts.

1:20:57.720 --> 1:20:59.456
I'm sorry.

1:21:03.429 --> 1:21:07.299
Thank you for inviting me
into your little game.

1:21:07.334 --> 1:21:08.630
But I should go.

1:21:08.665 --> 1:21:10.599
-No. No. No, no, no.
-Nick, come on, man.

1:21:10.634 --> 1:21:13.206
Nico.

1:21:15.012 --> 1:21:16.374
Way to go, Dana,
you pussy.

1:21:16.409 --> 1:21:18.277
Hey, fuck you, Fran.
You're a fraud.

1:21:18.312 --> 1:21:19.575
What'd you say?
You're a fraud.

1:21:19.610 --> 1:21:21.478
I saw your episode
of "Chef's Challenge,"

1:21:21.513 --> 1:21:23.150
and a fucking tween
beat you.

1:21:23.185 --> 1:21:24.613
A twe-- a tween?!

1:21:24.648 --> 1:21:27.451
Elliot is 13 1/2 years old.
That's not a tween.

1:21:27.486 --> 1:21:29.420
And, furthermore, the rules
are fucking bullshit.

1:21:29.455 --> 1:21:31.092
Think about it.
You know what?

1:21:31.127 --> 1:21:32.390
They edited it to make me
look like an asshole.

1:21:32.425 --> 1:21:33.490
You weren't even there.
Fuck you.

1:21:33.525 --> 1:21:35.096
- Enough!

1:21:35.131 --> 1:21:36.328
This is supposed to be
a team-building exercise.

1:21:36.363 --> 1:21:37.560
Dana, cool out.

1:21:37.595 --> 1:21:40.695
Ooh! Ooh! Fooh!

1:21:40.730 --> 1:21:43.038
Big man Craig standing up!

1:21:43.073 --> 1:21:45.304
You're a fucking fascist, okay?

1:21:45.339 --> 1:21:48.637
You have no right to kidnap us
like this, alright?

1:21:48.672 --> 1:21:51.343
I already apologized
about the video.

1:21:51.378 --> 1:21:53.015
Sit down.

1:21:53.050 --> 1:21:54.643
I'm not talking
about the video.
You're dead.

1:21:54.678 --> 1:21:56.216
I'm talking about the fact
that you're a fucking patchouli

1:21:56.251 --> 1:21:58.218
Charles Manson bitch
who I'm about to fuck up!

1:21:58.253 --> 1:22:00.088
Oh, we got a hot shot here.
You're out
of your fucking mind.

1:22:00.123 --> 1:22:01.518
Do you want to go back
to Teaneck?

1:22:01.553 --> 1:22:04.026
- Hey, hey.
I'm from Tenafly.

1:22:04.061 --> 1:22:06.259
Hey, Dana, come on.
Sit down now.

1:22:06.294 --> 1:22:08.426
-Sit down now.
-Take off your shirt.

1:22:08.461 --> 1:22:09.592
-I'm not gonna take my --
-Sit down!

1:22:09.627 --> 1:22:11.759
-No!
-Hey! Sit -- Hey!

1:22:11.794 --> 1:22:13.431
-I'm not about --
-Sit down!

1:22:13.466 --> 1:22:14.630
Now you're fucked!

1:22:14.665 --> 1:22:16.137
No, no, no, no.
Now you're fucked!

1:22:16.172 --> 1:22:18.535
Hey, come on, now.
Now my shirt's off,

1:22:18.570 --> 1:22:21.571
and I can't stop
till I feel blood.

1:22:21.606 --> 1:22:24.112
Sit down!
Okay!

1:22:24.147 --> 1:22:26.312
Good.
We won't fight.

1:22:26.347 --> 1:22:27.742
'Cause I'm starting to
feel sick anyway,

1:22:27.777 --> 1:22:29.744
'cause I guess something
seems to be going around.

1:22:31.319 --> 1:22:33.385
I'm gonna go drink
at the villa.

1:22:33.420 --> 1:22:36.190
- What?
What?

1:22:36.225 --> 1:22:37.719

I didn't ca-- That's --

1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:21.146
I wondered why you said
"sustained bliss."

1:36:21.181 --> 1:36:25.249
That -- I-I-I must
have zoned out.

1:36:25.284 --> 1:36:27.119
Hmm.

1:36:27.154 --> 1:36:30.023
But I don't think that excuses
all of your behavior.

1:36:30.058 --> 1:36:31.519
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I agree.

1:36:31.554 --> 1:36:33.895
I've done
regrettable things.

1:36:33.930 --> 1:36:35.193
And after everything
that happened,

1:36:35.228 --> 1:36:37.162
I've been doing
a lot of soul-searching,

1:36:37.197 --> 1:36:39.934
and I've realized
that it's best for me --

1:36:39.969 --> 1:36:42.497
and for others -- if I swear off
any kind of physical intimacy

1:36:42.532 --> 1:36:44.631
with anyone for a while.

1:36:44.666 --> 1:36:47.909
I'm celibate now.

Look, baby turtle,

1:36:49.913 --> 1:36:54.245
meeting you
genuinely opened me up.

1:36:58.383 --> 1:37:01.252
I can't believe you came all
this way to tell me that.

1:37:01.287 --> 1:37:03.617
I really needed to see you
again.

1:37:03.652 --> 1:37:07.357
That's wild.

1:37:07.392 --> 1:37:11.031
I guess I was hoping you'd
take me up on my offer

1:37:11.066 --> 1:37:14.496
to sail
the Amalfi Coast together --

1:37:14.531 --> 1:37:18.104
as my primary.

1:37:18.139 --> 1:37:21.338
I want to be
with you only.
