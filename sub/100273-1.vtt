WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:11.000
Sub By Black Hawk

01:15.841 --> 01:18.043
Walter, have you seen
my tweezers?

01:28.887 --> 01:31.890
Um, sorry.
Did you need that mug?

01:31.923 --> 01:34.293
I needed that coffee.

01:36.461 --> 01:37.662
So...

01:37.696 --> 01:38.797
<i> Unitee.</i>

01:38.798 --> 01:39.898
What you making, bud?

01:39.932 --> 01:40.998
A gadget for you

01:41.032 --> 01:42.334
- to wear on patrol.
- Oh.

01:42.367 --> 01:44.969
It's the perfect tool
to keep you safe.

01:45.003 --> 01:46.504
This button
makes a really loud sound

01:46.538 --> 01:48.307
to incapacitate your enemies.

01:51.843 --> 01:52.944
Like that.

01:52.978 --> 01:55.113
This one can wrap you
in an inflatable hug

01:55.146 --> 01:56.948
- so no one can hurt you.
- A-ha.

01:56.982 --> 01:59.885
And this one is for when
you're outnumbered.

01:59.918 --> 02:02.721
You just hold out your hand
and say, "Stop!"

02:02.754 --> 02:04.089
And boom!

02:04.123 --> 02:06.124
Glitter cloud!

02:06.158 --> 02:08.126
And the bad guys
will leave you alone.

02:08.158 --> 02:11.329
Oh! Because glitter makes
people happy?

02:11.363 --> 02:12.830
Because the refracted light

02:12.864 --> 02:14.499
causes the
enterochromaffin cells

02:14.533 --> 02:16.301
to release serotonin.

02:19.004 --> 02:21.173
Yeah, glitter makes
people happy.

02:21.973 --> 02:23.108
Let's try it out.

02:23.141 --> 02:24.209
Remember how you told me

02:24.242 --> 02:25.576
not to take apart
your cell phone?

02:25.610 --> 02:28.414
Walter Beckett,
you took apart my...

02:31.583 --> 02:32.751
Still wanna kill me?

02:33.885 --> 02:36.388
No. Just the opposite.

02:36.422 --> 02:37.322
Then it works!

02:37.355 --> 02:39.157
I also wanna add
some kitten visuals

02:39.190 --> 02:41.092
to trigger
the orbitofrontal cortex.

02:41.126 --> 02:42.169
<i>11-A-25,</i>

02:42.193 --> 02:43.929
<i>Code Six, 104 North.</i>

02:43.962 --> 02:45.063
Hon, I gotta go.

02:45.096 --> 02:46.298
Time for my shift.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.334
Be good for Gram, okay?

02:49.367 --> 02:50.802
Uh, I'll come with you.

02:50.835 --> 02:52.337
I can finish this on the way.

02:52.370 --> 02:53.872
You won't even know I'm there.

02:53.905 --> 02:58.276
What you need to do
is get ready for school.

02:58.309 --> 03:00.946
Oh, Mom, school's boring.

03:00.979 --> 03:03.481
And the kids think I'm weird.

03:03.515 --> 03:04.783
Weird?

03:04.816 --> 03:06.018
Hey, look at me.

03:06.051 --> 03:07.652
What's wrong with weird?

03:07.686 --> 03:09.654
The world needs weird.

03:09.688 --> 03:13.725
Listen, I'm out there
keeping the neighborhood safe.

03:14.292 --> 03:17.796
But one day, your ideas...

03:17.829 --> 03:20.198
your gadgets...

03:20.231 --> 03:23.335
are gonna keep the world safe.

03:23.368 --> 03:27.773
And everybody will wish
they were as weird as you.

03:28.774 --> 03:29.775
You think?

03:30.441 --> 03:32.144
I know.

03:33.612 --> 03:36.482
Now, give me
a non-inflatable hug.

03:40.085 --> 03:41.587
Love you, partner.

03:43.221 --> 03:46.458
I promise
I'll always have your back.

03:47.859 --> 03:49.595
Team Weird?

03:51.029 --> 03:52.564
Team Weird.

04:12.951 --> 04:14.786
Man, it's cold!

04:15.553 --> 04:17.286
Hey, fellas.

04:19.123 --> 04:20.201
Special Agent Lance Sterling.

04:20.225 --> 04:21.257
How you livin'?

04:22.928 --> 04:24.863
Whoa, okay, okay.

04:25.630 --> 04:26.798
Everybody good?

04:26.831 --> 04:28.199
I'm just gonna take his gun

04:28.233 --> 04:29.868
and I'm gonna toss it
to that snowman.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.970
And while you're both looking
all confused,

04:32.004 --> 04:33.213
trying to figure out
what's going on...

04:33.237 --> 04:35.439
- I'm just gonna knock you out.
- Huh?

04:41.379 --> 04:42.713
Ugh.

04:42.747 --> 04:44.182
He didn't deserve that.

04:45.317 --> 04:47.418
Rats with wings.

04:51.022 --> 04:52.199
<i> I'm in position.</i>

04:52.223 --> 04:53.859
What is your situation?

04:55.793 --> 04:58.028
Just getting a visual...

04:58.063 --> 04:59.331
now.

05:05.403 --> 05:07.372
<i> 10 o'clock.</i>

05:07.406 --> 05:09.139
Katsu Kimura.

05:09.174 --> 05:10.976
Everybody's favorite
arms dealer.

05:11.009 --> 05:13.978
<i>There.
That briefcase is your objective.</i>

05:14.012 --> 05:16.148
Inside is the M9 Assassin.

05:16.181 --> 05:18.250
The first semi-autonomous
attack drone,

05:18.283 --> 05:20.251
powered by atmospheric energy.

05:20.285 --> 05:21.419
<i>Never shuts down,</i>

05:21.452 --> 05:23.554
<i>never stops pursuing its target.</i>

05:23.588 --> 05:25.890
They stole it
from our covert weapons lab.

05:25.924 --> 05:27.859
Uh, Director Jenkins,

05:27.892 --> 05:28.961
He's got incoming.

05:28.994 --> 05:32.231
Detecting 70 extra hostiles
around the perimeter.

05:32.264 --> 05:34.833
I don't want
another mess like Kyrgyzstan.

05:34.866 --> 05:37.902
Lance, listen to me.
You've got 70 yakuza incoming.

05:37.936 --> 05:39.204
Stand down.

05:39.237 --> 05:41.215
<i>That's better odds than I usually get.</i>

05:41.239 --> 05:42.740
No! Do not engage.

05:42.774 --> 05:44.943
This time, you need to wait
for the backup team.

05:44.976 --> 05:46.778
<i> Team?</i>

05:47.879 --> 05:48.913
I fly solo.

05:48.947 --> 05:50.787
Wait. Lance, listen to...

05:52.584 --> 05:55.887
I think he cut off...

05:55.920 --> 05:56.788
- I get it!
- Yeah, great,

05:56.821 --> 05:58.232
That's right. Sorry.

06:23.181 --> 06:24.483
Huh.

06:49.107 --> 06:50.675
Uh-oh.

06:50.708 --> 06:52.944
Guess it's time
to introduce myself.

06:58.149 --> 06:59.918
Huh?

07:23.307 --> 07:24.408
You know how you can tell

07:24.442 --> 07:26.209
when you're the world's
greatest spy?

07:26.244 --> 07:28.714
Sterling.

07:28.747 --> 07:30.247
Lance Sterling.

07:30.281 --> 07:31.882
Everyone knows the name.

07:32.483 --> 07:33.685
I'mma need that case.

07:43.595 --> 07:47.232
Just 3 ounces of pressure
to the vagus nerve...

07:47.265 --> 07:48.767
and then look at your boy.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.367
Sleepy night-night.

07:50.402 --> 07:52.404
Hey, you mind giving me a hand?

07:56.774 --> 07:58.176
Hey, come on.

07:58.209 --> 07:59.745
What was it?
The hand joke?

08:10.288 --> 08:12.591
You don't remember me, do you?

08:13.624 --> 08:15.761
What can I say?
I meet a lot of bad guys.

08:17.162 --> 08:21.400
I'm gonna show you pain
that you can't imagine.

08:42.687 --> 08:46.024
I don't think
that subtitle was in my favor.

08:47.993 --> 08:50.594
Okay. Oh, okay.

08:51.629 --> 08:54.432
You wanna do it the hard way?
Let's go, then.

08:54.465 --> 08:55.967
Let's do it the hard way.

09:02.206 --> 09:03.675
It's about to get messy.

09:09.681 --> 09:11.516
Aw.

09:12.183 --> 09:13.518
What the...

09:40.979 --> 09:42.113
Ooh.

09:49.420 --> 09:51.255
Hey, don't take
the loss so hard.

09:51.289 --> 09:52.390
I mean, you did great.

09:52.423 --> 09:53.925
And you got to meet
Lance Sterling.

12:29.247 --> 12:32.183
Next. Okay,
put everything in the bin.

12:32.216 --> 12:33.918
Yes, come through.

12:33.951 --> 12:35.186
Oh! He's coming.

12:35.187 --> 12:36.421
Wow.
Here he comes!

12:36.454 --> 12:37.655
Yes,

12:37.689 --> 12:39.123
Your eyes aren't deceiving you.

12:39.157 --> 12:40.358
Yep, it's him.

12:40.391 --> 12:41.492
Thank you, thank you.

12:41.525 --> 12:42.703
Looking good,
Agent Sterling!

12:42.727 --> 12:44.962
Hey, not looking
so bad yourself.

12:44.996 --> 12:46.073
Thank you. Thank you.

12:46.097 --> 12:47.865
Yeah, you know what?
Go ahead back to work.

12:47.898 --> 12:50.568
Go ahead back to work.
It's too much.

12:50.602 --> 12:51.869
It's probably the right amount.

12:51.902 --> 12:53.180
But still go back to work.

12:53.204 --> 12:54.239
Still go back to work.

12:54.272 --> 12:55.907
You're so crazy.

12:57.241 --> 12:58.281
What's up, Sterling?

12:58.309 --> 12:59.410
Lucas!

12:59.444 --> 13:00.578
My name's Dave.

13:00.611 --> 13:03.381
There you go.
Good to see you.

13:03.414 --> 13:04.448
Morning, sir.

13:04.482 --> 13:05.883
Fellas, give it to me.

13:05.917 --> 13:07.052
Dude, did you see that?

13:07.053 --> 13:08.186
Never wash that hand again.

13:08.219 --> 13:10.821
I feel stronger.
Like, I legit feel stronger.

13:10.855 --> 13:12.389
- Can I hold it?
- Yeah.

13:12.423 --> 13:14.201
- Dude from Accounting.
- Thanks for the win, Sterling.

13:14.225 --> 13:16.494
Keep my money right.
Keep my money right.

13:16.527 --> 13:17.661
Go ahead, man.
All right.

13:17.695 --> 13:18.772
Hey,
welcome back, Lance.

13:18.796 --> 13:20.031
Thank you, thank you.

13:23.234 --> 13:25.969
Aw, he's the most
adorable agent ever!

13:26.003 --> 13:27.305
Somebody gonna get it.

13:54.832 --> 13:56.334
Oh! Agent Sterling.

13:59.471 --> 14:00.571
Walter Beckett.

14:00.604 --> 14:01.682
Weirdo.

14:02.807 --> 14:04.017
<i>Unitee loves you.</i>

14:04.041 --> 14:05.642
All right, Unitee.

14:05.677 --> 14:07.111
Imagine...

14:07.144 --> 14:11.516
A hydrothermal explosion is
about to melt your face off.

14:11.549 --> 14:12.950
But what's this?

14:12.983 --> 14:14.862
A gadget that can surround you
in a pressurized pocket

14:14.886 --> 14:16.120
of safety?

14:16.153 --> 14:18.623
"Can it work?"
It hasn't yet, but maybe.

14:18.656 --> 14:19.700
Here we go.

14:19.724 --> 14:21.859
Session number nine,
test 30... Oh!

14:22.560 --> 14:23.861
Oh, hey, Terrance.

14:23.895 --> 14:26.397
Tonight's the season finale
of <i> Hearts in Seoul.</i>

14:26.431 --> 14:27.565
I sent you an e-vite.

14:27.599 --> 14:29.566
I, uh...

14:29.600 --> 14:31.269
You just click "accept"
in your...

14:31.736 --> 14:33.137
Agent Sterling.

14:33.170 --> 14:35.940
Uh... Hi, wow.
Uh, Walter Beckett.

14:35.973 --> 14:37.175
Pleasure to meet...

14:37.641 --> 14:39.310
Aw.

14:39.343 --> 14:40.478
You used it.

14:40.511 --> 14:43.013
You touched my stuff.

14:43.047 --> 14:45.949
Okay, okay. Look, I know
it's non-traditional, but...

14:45.983 --> 14:47.318
Feel me here, little man.

14:47.351 --> 14:48.786
So, I'm out there...

14:48.820 --> 14:50.988
and I'm saving the world,
doing big things.

14:51.021 --> 14:52.390
- That's what I do.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:52.423 --> 14:54.192
And the way I do it...

14:54.225 --> 14:55.893
is to have my things

14:55.926 --> 14:58.628
do the things
I expect my things to do.

14:58.662 --> 14:59.830
Yep. Ow.

14:59.864 --> 15:02.767
Like blow stuff up.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.234
See, out there...

15:04.268 --> 15:07.771
I gotta fight fire with fire.

15:07.805 --> 15:11.242
Because if I try to fight fire
with glitter...

15:12.544 --> 15:15.213
I could get my face burned off.

15:15.646 --> 15:16.814
But you didn't.

15:16.847 --> 15:18.582
Because the kitty glitter
worked.

15:18.615 --> 15:19.884
- Kitty litter?
- Glitter.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.519
Kitty glitter.

15:21.552 --> 15:23.821
It's scientifically proven
that watching kittens...

15:23.855 --> 15:25.790
causes the
enterochromaffin cells

15:25.823 --> 15:27.025
to release serotonin.

15:29.594 --> 15:30.927
Glitter makes people happy.

15:30.961 --> 15:33.464
Know what works
even better?

15:33.498 --> 15:35.032
A grenade.

15:35.065 --> 15:36.867
It's kinda violent,
don't you think?

15:36.900 --> 15:38.802
Can't save the world
with a hug, Wilson.

15:38.836 --> 15:40.805
It's Walter.

15:40.838 --> 15:42.839
And what if you could?

15:42.873 --> 15:44.374
The inflatable hug.

15:46.043 --> 15:49.581
Kind of a personal protection device
I've been developing.

15:58.355 --> 16:02.359
This is a vile
waste of taxpayer dollars.

16:05.296 --> 16:07.297
Look, I'm just saying
you can do more

16:07.331 --> 16:09.067
by bringing people together...

16:09.100 --> 16:10.467
than blowing them up.

16:10.501 --> 16:12.003
And if I can convince you,

16:12.036 --> 16:14.037
we can convince
the whole agency.

16:14.071 --> 16:15.673
There is no "we."

16:15.706 --> 16:16.840
Uh, Agent Sterling.
Just...

16:16.874 --> 16:18.509
- Okay. Okay, okay.
- Millennials.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.086
No, wait, wait, wait.
Please don't close that door.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.187
Not interested.

16:21.211 --> 16:22.255
Listen, you gotta hear me out.

16:22.279 --> 16:24.048
Whatever it is, no.

16:26.150 --> 16:28.128
Phew. Look, I've been working

16:28.152 --> 16:29.229
On this thing at home, right...

16:29.253 --> 16:32.257
that is gonna change
spying forever.

16:33.191 --> 16:34.091
Imagine...

16:34.124 --> 16:36.327
if I could make you,
wait for it...

16:36.361 --> 16:37.562
drumroll, please...

16:38.195 --> 16:40.730
disappear.

16:40.765 --> 16:41.799
Disappear?

16:41.833 --> 16:42.867
Yeah.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.569
Disappear.

16:45.269 --> 16:46.670
Why are you saying it like that?

16:46.703 --> 16:49.674
For effect.

16:51.275 --> 16:53.044
I'm totally excited about it.

16:53.077 --> 16:54.154
It's called

16:54.178 --> 16:56.214
Bio-dynamic concealment.

16:56.247 --> 16:57.982
Boom. Mic drop.

16:58.015 --> 17:00.251
Huh? Conceal this?

17:01.485 --> 17:03.030
I mean, you wouldn't
need a bulletproof suit.

17:03.054 --> 17:04.431
You wouldn't need
exploding cufflinks.

17:04.454 --> 17:06.257
You could blend in anywhere.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.326
What if you were totally...

17:10.161 --> 17:11.930
...invisible?

17:13.330 --> 17:14.832
Wow. Dude.

17:14.865 --> 17:16.733
That's a mess.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.201
Don't worry yourself.

17:18.234 --> 17:20.204
The effects,
they're only temporary.

17:20.238 --> 17:22.772
All right, cool, cool.
I'm gonna get outta here.

17:22.806 --> 17:24.174
Wait, wait, wait.

17:25.476 --> 17:28.912
Look, you're the world's greatest spy.

17:28.946 --> 17:30.981
Nobody ever listens to my ideas

17:31.014 --> 17:33.017
or gives me a chance...

17:33.050 --> 17:35.253
but if you did...

17:35.286 --> 17:36.287
together...

17:37.421 --> 17:40.058
we could really
make a difference.

17:40.691 --> 17:42.026
"Make a difference"?

17:42.059 --> 17:45.062
Boy, I am the difference.

17:45.096 --> 17:48.699
All I need from you
is when I want a grenade...

17:48.732 --> 17:50.668
make me a grenade.

17:50.701 --> 17:51.703
Can you do that?

17:53.437 --> 17:54.489
There's a better way.

17:56.473 --> 17:57.575
Wrong answer, Willy.

17:57.608 --> 17:59.576
You're fired.

17:59.610 --> 18:00.978
What? Wait.

18:01.012 --> 18:03.414
No, no, no.
Uh, please don't fire me!

18:10.588 --> 18:12.056
Weirdo.

18:15.693 --> 18:17.360
Mission accomplished.

18:17.395 --> 18:20.497
Oh, man, I'm telling you,
it was one of my best.

18:20.531 --> 18:22.300
I was on fire.

18:22.333 --> 18:26.403
Fighting, explosions,
tons of witty catchphrases.

18:26.437 --> 18:27.271
Lance?

18:27.304 --> 18:30.508
I had to jump
through a helicopter.

18:30.541 --> 18:31.742
Lance?

18:33.277 --> 18:34.712
- Right?
- Lance!

18:34.745 --> 18:36.247
- Hmm?
- Please tell me

18:36.280 --> 18:39.217
You have an explanation
for why this is empty.

18:40.851 --> 18:42.053
I know why.

18:42.753 --> 18:43.954
Because he stole it.

18:43.987 --> 18:45.222
Excuse me?

18:45.256 --> 18:47.491
Agent Marcy Kappel,
Internal Affairs.

18:47.525 --> 18:49.527
Mind if my team sweeps the room?

18:49.560 --> 18:50.728
Yes, I mind.

18:50.761 --> 18:52.030
They call me Eyes.

18:52.063 --> 18:54.832
Spectral analysis
and quantum optical thermography.

18:54.865 --> 18:56.733
Ears. Sound.

18:57.001 --> 18:58.269
Okay.

18:58.302 --> 19:01.039
Hey, y'all need to ease out
of my face right now.

19:01.439 --> 19:02.372
Whoa! Hey.

19:02.406 --> 19:04.909
Weapons deactivated.
Backing up.

19:04.942 --> 19:06.710
Take Agent Sterling
into custody.

19:06.743 --> 19:08.212
All right, enough!

19:08.245 --> 19:11.115
We're talking about
my top agent here.

19:11.148 --> 19:12.750
I trust this man.

19:14.151 --> 19:17.388
The only thing we can trust
is the facts.

19:17.421 --> 19:18.822
Eyes?

19:18.855 --> 19:20.458
A surveillance camera in Tokyo

19:20.491 --> 19:22.426
picked this up two hours
after your mission.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.370
<i>Stop right there.</i>

19:40.611 --> 19:41.945
- Lance?
- Joy.

19:41.979 --> 19:43.247
His heart rate just spiked.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.749
That's because it isn't me.

19:44.782 --> 19:46.284
Vocal patterns
is all off the hook.

19:46.317 --> 19:47.418
This has to be wrong.

19:47.451 --> 19:49.553
This is wrong!
I didn't...

19:49.586 --> 19:52.789
Look, there was a guy
with a robot hand.

19:52.823 --> 19:54.158
He stole the Assassin,

19:54.191 --> 19:56.559
and he scanned my face
to frame me.

19:56.594 --> 19:57.995
That sounds plausible,

19:58.028 --> 19:59.895
and not like something
you just made up.

19:59.930 --> 20:01.565
Sounds a little Scooby-Doo, bro.

20:01.598 --> 20:02.433
It isn't me!

20:02.466 --> 20:04.535
Okay, so, just to be clear...

20:04.568 --> 20:08.105
there's a man with a robot hand
and Lance's face

20:08.138 --> 20:10.140
who took the M9 Assassin.

20:10.174 --> 20:11.308
We all feel good about that?

20:11.342 --> 20:13.211
Okay, case closed.
Let's go home.

20:14.212 --> 20:15.279
You know what?

20:15.312 --> 20:16.447
There's a bad guy

20:16.480 --> 20:17.548
who needs to be stopped.

20:18.649 --> 20:20.751
Couldn't agree more.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.653
Huh. You're good.

20:22.686 --> 20:24.888
Lance, just cooperate.

20:24.922 --> 20:26.824
Didn't see that coming, did you?

20:26.857 --> 20:28.459
Did you see that coming?

20:32.496 --> 20:34.732
He's running.
Why do they always run?

20:38.469 --> 20:40.337
Off to save the world again?

20:40.370 --> 20:41.939
Uh, yeah, you, too.
You, too.

20:41.972 --> 20:43.123
'Sup, Sterling?

20:43.124 --> 20:44.273
All good, all good.

20:44.308 --> 20:45.910
Sorry.

20:45.943 --> 20:47.712
Sterling!

20:48.813 --> 20:49.680
Now.

20:49.714 --> 20:51.023
<i>Northwest corner.</i>

20:51.047 --> 20:52.250
Got him.

20:57.588 --> 20:58.828
Coming through, coming through.

21:02.260 --> 21:03.693
Security!

21:04.361 --> 21:06.230
Shut this place down!

21:06.264 --> 21:07.297
Agent Sterling?

21:07.330 --> 21:08.733
I would do what she says.

21:08.766 --> 21:10.701
She is very unpleasant.

22:03.187 --> 22:04.822
Agent Sterling!
What's happening, man?

22:04.855 --> 22:07.391
I was just telling the guys
about the time you...

22:21.906 --> 22:23.241
All right, Sterling.

22:24.708 --> 22:25.843
Think.

22:26.477 --> 22:27.511
Think.

22:28.646 --> 22:31.716
Somebody else knows
about Robot Hand.

22:32.115 --> 22:34.352
Who?

22:37.321 --> 22:38.522
<i>Kimura.</i>

22:39.723 --> 22:41.425
Find Kimura.

22:41.459 --> 22:43.427
<i>Tracking Katsu Kimura.</i>

22:43.461 --> 22:46.663
<i>Wireless signal intercepted
in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico.</i>

22:46.697 --> 22:47.965
<i>You shouldn't be calling me.</i>

22:47.999 --> 22:49.031
Mexico.

22:49.065 --> 22:50.167
<i>I'm trying to lay low!</i>

22:53.838 --> 22:55.439
I need to disappear.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.777
Disappear.

23:03.547 --> 23:04.615
Bingo.

23:04.648 --> 23:06.751
Hope you got
your pants on, Wilbur.

23:23.934 --> 23:25.736
<i> Unitee.</i>

23:28.572 --> 23:30.741
I miss you, Mom.

24:10.214 --> 24:11.348
See, Lovey?

24:11.382 --> 24:13.417
Some dreams do come true.

24:13.451 --> 24:14.919
Oh, um...

24:17.188 --> 24:18.656
Okay.

24:32.769 --> 24:35.306
Commencing bio-dynamic
concealment

24:35.339 --> 24:37.808
test number 83, batch five.

24:40.177 --> 24:43.146
Exothermic reaction.

24:43.179 --> 24:44.714
That's an exothermic reaction.

24:44.748 --> 24:47.918
Uh, Lovey, could I borrow
a feather, please?

24:47.951 --> 24:49.520
Thank you.

24:49.553 --> 24:51.188
Here's a little something
for you.

24:58.161 --> 25:00.430
If this works,

25:00.464 --> 25:02.533
they'll have to
give me my job back.

25:11.441 --> 25:13.778
No way. It worked.

25:14.444 --> 25:15.579
It worked.

25:15.613 --> 25:17.180
It worked! It worked!
It worked!

25:17.214 --> 25:18.382
Lovey, it worked!
It worked!

25:18.415 --> 25:19.650
I need to disappear.

25:22.385 --> 25:23.663
What... How did you...

25:23.687 --> 25:25.365
What are you doing in my...

25:25.389 --> 25:26.500
What's up?

25:26.524 --> 25:27.624
Okay, listen.

25:27.658 --> 25:29.526
That next-generation
concealment tech

25:29.560 --> 25:30.894
you were
talking about earlier...

25:30.928 --> 25:33.563
you wouldn't happen
to have it on hand, would you?

25:33.597 --> 25:36.433
Actually, I do happen
to have it in hand.

25:36.466 --> 25:37.468
Show it to me.

25:37.469 --> 25:38.469
Sure. Um...

25:38.502 --> 25:39.703
Well, can I offer you a drink?

25:39.736 --> 25:40.771
I got water,

25:40.804 --> 25:42.672
Soylent drinkable
meal replacement...

25:42.706 --> 25:44.574
Mmm. Good.
We had a drink.

25:44.608 --> 25:45.885
So, what are we
talking about here?

25:45.909 --> 25:47.544
Light-bending camo suit?

25:47.578 --> 25:49.680
Adaptive response silicon...

25:49.713 --> 25:52.315
Diet stuff
has a weird aftertaste.

25:52.349 --> 25:53.483
What's the tech?

25:53.516 --> 25:57.388
Um... Well,
you just drank it.

25:57.421 --> 25:59.189
- Drank what?
- The tech.

25:59.223 --> 26:00.324
Now it's gone. Yep.

26:01.458 --> 26:03.126
Why do you have
a pigeon in here?

26:03.160 --> 26:06.463
Yeah, okay, that's just Lovey.
She's my roommate.

26:06.496 --> 26:07.606
- How am I gonna do this?
- Um, that's weird.

26:07.630 --> 26:08.699
This is bad.
No, it's not.

26:08.732 --> 26:09.972
To have a pigeon in your house.

26:10.000 --> 26:10.834
It's amazing.

26:10.867 --> 26:12.803
It's science. Here we go.

26:12.836 --> 26:14.837
You just drank
an ingestible formula

26:14.871 --> 26:16.606
that uses a CRISPR-Cas9
genetic editor...

26:16.640 --> 26:19.142
to resequence your DNA
on a molecular level.

26:20.378 --> 26:21.578
Science rocks.

26:21.611 --> 26:24.314
Wow! Okay, here's
what I need you to do.

26:24.347 --> 26:26.383
Pretend like
you're a normal person

26:26.416 --> 26:28.652
talking to a much cooler
normal person.

26:28.685 --> 26:31.554
In precisely 45 seconds,

26:31.588 --> 26:33.524
you will transform into...

26:34.024 --> 26:35.025
a pigeon.

26:45.135 --> 26:46.135
I'm out.

26:46.570 --> 26:47.771
Wait, wait, wait.

26:47.805 --> 26:49.045
What you're about to experience

26:49.073 --> 26:50.483
is the future of espionage.

26:50.507 --> 26:51.674
Okay.

26:51.708 --> 26:54.644
You might be experiencing
some mild discomfort.

26:55.797 --> 26:56.914
Or severe.

26:56.947 --> 26:58.424
I'll make a note of that.

26:58.448 --> 27:00.017
This is because
I fired you, right?

27:01.451 --> 27:03.319
Okay, I'm gonna walk outta here.

27:03.353 --> 27:04.721
Yeah, that might be hard.

27:04.754 --> 27:08.192
Because you're in the middle
of chromothripsis.

27:09.092 --> 27:10.760
Okay, might pass out.

27:10.794 --> 27:12.929
Oh, you're definitely
gonna pass out.

27:12.963 --> 27:15.465
Your genomes
are being smashed apart...

27:15.498 --> 27:17.568
so they can be reassembled
with pigeon DNA.

27:17.601 --> 27:20.237
Muscle it down, Lance.

27:20.270 --> 27:21.637
Muscle it down.

27:21.672 --> 27:24.708
Oh! What did you do?
What did you do?

27:24.741 --> 27:26.675
Whoa.
You're entering Phase Two.

27:26.710 --> 27:27.844
Epigenetic modulation.

27:29.012 --> 27:30.747
Think of each gene
as having a switch.

27:30.781 --> 27:33.483
And one by one, your switches
are flipping to pigeon.

27:33.516 --> 27:36.019
Human-pigeon, human-pigeon,
human-pigeon.

27:36.052 --> 27:38.755
Human-pigeon,
human-pigeon, human-pigeon.

27:38.788 --> 27:41.091
Stop with the lights!

27:41.124 --> 27:42.726
Wait, look at my hand!

27:42.759 --> 27:46.195
What's happening
to my hand?

27:46.230 --> 27:47.430
Baby hand.

27:47.464 --> 27:49.767
This is the final phase!

27:53.837 --> 27:56.807
This isn't so bad.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.718
Your body is being
flooded with endorphins

27:58.742 --> 28:00.511
to prepare you
for the immense physical pain

28:00.544 --> 28:02.646
you're about to experience.

28:02.679 --> 28:05.082
Wait. Say that again.

28:08.052 --> 28:09.920
You poisoned me!

28:10.320 --> 28:11.421
"Poisoned"?

28:11.454 --> 28:13.290
That's not even my department.

28:13.323 --> 28:15.059
Squeeze the poison out.

28:17.528 --> 28:19.429
I wouldn't do that.

28:19.463 --> 28:20.607
Three seconds.

28:20.631 --> 28:22.966
You're gonna be fine.
Trust me.

28:22.999 --> 28:24.567
Here we go.

28:27.204 --> 28:28.272
Hmm?

28:29.073 --> 28:30.541
- Ha!
- What?

28:32.042 --> 28:33.060
Whoa. That clock's fast.

28:38.415 --> 28:39.750
Lance?

28:41.384 --> 28:42.385
Lance.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.421
It worked.

28:44.454 --> 28:45.922
Subject's vitals are stable.

28:45.956 --> 28:49.193
Inserting rectal thermometer.

28:52.495 --> 28:54.632
It's okay, buddy.

28:55.532 --> 28:57.533
Hey, it's okay.
Don't you worry.

28:57.567 --> 28:59.234
Your good friend Walter is here.

29:07.578 --> 29:08.829
Subject appears disoriented.

29:10.881 --> 29:12.682
Of course I'm disoriented.

29:12.715 --> 29:13.784
You can talk?

29:13.817 --> 29:15.352
Lovey, he can talk!

29:15.385 --> 29:16.453
- It worked.
- My eyes!

29:16.487 --> 29:17.563
It worked.
Can you believe this?

29:17.587 --> 29:18.631
What did you do
to my eyes?

29:18.655 --> 29:20.390
- Hey, Lance, look at me.
- What did...

29:20.423 --> 29:21.558
Look at you?

29:21.592 --> 29:24.127
I can't not look at you, Walter.

29:24.161 --> 29:27.798
I can see my butt
and your face at the same time!

29:27.831 --> 29:29.199
That is so cool!

29:29.232 --> 29:31.901
Fact, pigeons have
360-degree vision.

29:31.935 --> 29:33.704
Now, nobody can sneak up
behind you.

29:33.737 --> 29:35.481
- Stop, girl. Come on.
- This is so great.

29:35.505 --> 29:38.575
Pigeons can be found
in every major city around the world...

29:38.608 --> 29:39.810
and no one notices them.

29:39.843 --> 29:41.944
It's the most perfect form
a spy could take.

29:41.978 --> 29:44.781
You better un-bird me right now.

29:44.814 --> 29:47.183
That's it. I'm not playing
with you. Un-bird...

29:47.217 --> 29:48.184
I'm raising my voice.

29:48.218 --> 29:50.553
I probably shouldn't be
raising my voice at you.

29:50.587 --> 29:51.788
I guess you could imagine

29:51.822 --> 29:53.066
I'm a little stressed right now.

29:53.090 --> 29:55.359
I need you
to un-bird me, Walter.

29:55.392 --> 29:56.359
Mmm-hmm.
Of course.

29:56.393 --> 29:58.261
I'll start working
on an antidote right now.

29:58.295 --> 29:59.462
Start?

29:59.496 --> 30:00.940
Well, the formula
was purely theoretical until you...

30:00.964 --> 30:03.633
You're gonna start?
You don't have an antidote?

30:03.667 --> 30:05.469
Stop, girl, seriously.

30:05.502 --> 30:06.703
Okay, okay.

30:06.737 --> 30:09.206
So, you birded me,
and you can't un-bird me.

30:09.239 --> 30:12.107
Technically, you kind of
birded yourself.

30:12.142 --> 30:13.876
I'mma hurt this boy.

30:13.910 --> 30:15.054
- I'mma hurt this boy.
- No, no, look.

30:15.078 --> 30:16.813
I know you're upset,
but everything's okay.

30:16.846 --> 30:18.558
I called the Agency
and told them you're here.

30:18.582 --> 30:19.683
You did what?

30:19.716 --> 30:20.784
No, no, no, it's okay.

30:20.818 --> 30:21.860
I didn't tell them
you're a bird.

30:21.884 --> 30:23.028
Although I think they're gonna

30:23.052 --> 30:24.821
figure that out
pretty quickly.

30:24.854 --> 30:26.723
I gotta ghost.

30:28.425 --> 30:32.429
Yeah, there may be one or two downsides
to your new form.

30:32.462 --> 30:35.131
Webster, open the door.

30:35.165 --> 30:37.000
Okay. Okay.

30:37.034 --> 30:39.135
What... Why are you running
from the Agency?

30:39.169 --> 30:41.271
Get off me! I'm running...

30:41.305 --> 30:43.774
because there's a bad guy
out there with my face...

30:43.807 --> 30:45.141
and now I have to try
to stop him

30:45.174 --> 30:47.443
from hurting people
while being a bird.

30:47.477 --> 30:50.013
And thank you for that.
Thank you very much for that.

30:50.046 --> 30:52.349
You know what?
You're fired again.

30:52.715 --> 30:53.884
Double fired!

30:53.917 --> 30:55.785
Mmm, I don't think
that's a thing.

30:55.819 --> 30:58.355
Oh, it's a thing.
It's a thing now.

31:05.762 --> 31:07.464
Okay.

31:07.497 --> 31:08.765
It's a wingsuit.

31:08.798 --> 31:10.166
How hard could it be?

31:12.235 --> 31:13.937
Time to fly.

31:16.473 --> 31:17.608
Nope.

31:17.641 --> 31:19.876
You broke into the Kremlin
using a napkin

31:19.910 --> 31:21.344
and a piece of duct tape.

31:21.378 --> 31:25.782
You should be able
to get into your own car!

31:31.855 --> 31:34.091
Yep, yep, yep.

31:35.625 --> 31:38.395
Got it, got it,
got it... Ow!

31:38.428 --> 31:39.429
Come on.

31:44.534 --> 31:47.137
Okay, hear me out.

31:47.170 --> 31:49.082
Is somebody talking?
I don't hear anybody talking.

31:49.106 --> 31:51.406
Especially somebody
that's been double fired...

31:51.441 --> 31:52.775
working on a triple fire.

31:52.809 --> 31:54.143
I'll come with you.

31:54.177 --> 31:56.089
I can show you all the advantages
of being a pigeon

31:56.113 --> 31:58.315
and how it can make you
an even better spy.

31:58.348 --> 32:00.483
And then you'll give me
my job back.

32:00.517 --> 32:01.785
We both win.

32:01.818 --> 32:03.586
All right,
let me think about that.

32:03.620 --> 32:04.821
No.

32:06.056 --> 32:08.292
Okay. Well,
I suppose you have somebody else

32:08.325 --> 32:09.393
who has a mobile lab...

32:10.160 --> 32:12.062
who could turn you back
into a man.

32:13.663 --> 32:15.598
- Get in the car.
- You won't even know I'm here.

32:24.107 --> 32:25.708
I'll just ride out here,
don't worry.

32:25.742 --> 32:27.677
Oh, right. My bad.

32:29.245 --> 32:31.181
Go, go, go!
Moving through.

32:31.214 --> 32:32.649
I want that tree gone, now!

32:32.683 --> 32:33.826
<i>Agent Sterling,</i>

32:33.850 --> 32:35.018
<i>exit the premises now!</i>

32:35.051 --> 32:36.920
What are you doing?
Get in the car!

32:36.953 --> 32:38.097
Holy...

32:38.121 --> 32:39.923
Wilfred! Let's move!

32:39.956 --> 32:41.425
Let's go, go, go!

32:42.458 --> 32:44.027
Activate auto-drive.

32:44.061 --> 32:45.695
<i>Auto-drive engaged.</i>

32:45.728 --> 32:47.531
Sterling private jet hangar.

32:47.998 --> 32:49.333
See that, Walter?

32:49.366 --> 32:50.866
You can bird me...

32:50.900 --> 32:52.636
but you can't stop me.

32:56.038 --> 32:57.973
He was behind us.

32:58.008 --> 32:59.276
Buckle up. And get me

32:59.309 --> 33:01.077
everything we can
on that Beckett kid.

33:01.110 --> 33:02.521
You think
they're working together?

33:02.545 --> 33:04.981
Sterling works alone.
He's using him for something.

33:11.988 --> 33:13.624
You brought the lady bird?

33:13.657 --> 33:15.358
She's my emotional
support animal.

33:15.391 --> 33:18.127
You're gonna need
a life support animal

33:18.161 --> 33:19.429
if that bird poop in my...

33:20.915 --> 33:22.366
We got company.

33:22.399 --> 33:24.067
We've got units
blocking every street,

33:24.101 --> 33:26.602
overpass, and exit
within a 5-mile radius.

33:26.636 --> 33:29.305
Perfect.
Time for a cattle drive.

33:29.339 --> 33:30.507
Saddle up!

33:32.175 --> 33:34.277
<i>Evasive maneuvers activated.</i>

33:39.115 --> 33:41.483
I don't have
time for this.

33:41.518 --> 33:42.419
- Activate weapons.
- What?

33:42.452 --> 33:43.863
- <i>Activating weapons.</i>
- Relax.

33:43.887 --> 33:45.855
I'm just gonna
take out her tires.

33:45.889 --> 33:47.557
Uh, that's really bad.

33:47.590 --> 33:48.725
I dare you.

33:48.759 --> 33:49.835
<i>Deactivating weapons.</i>

33:49.859 --> 33:50.903
No,
we're the good guys.

33:50.927 --> 33:52.829
We can't shoot
the other good guys.

33:52.862 --> 33:53.963
Yeah, you're right, Walter.

33:53.997 --> 33:55.374
Let's just pull over
and talk it out.

33:55.398 --> 33:56.499
Exactly. Can we?

33:56.533 --> 33:58.234
- Activate weapons.
- <i>Activating weapons.</i>

33:58.268 --> 34:00.403
- Deactivate weapons.
<i>- Deactivating weapons.</i>

34:00.437 --> 34:02.348
How about something
non-lethal like oil slick?

34:02.372 --> 34:03.206
Activate weapons.

34:03.239 --> 34:04.473
Deactivate weapons.

34:04.508 --> 34:06.219
Don't listen to Walter.
Activate weapons.

34:06.243 --> 34:07.387
- Oil slick.
- Activate weapons.

34:07.411 --> 34:10.179
Oil slick! Oil slick!
Oil slick!

34:11.481 --> 34:12.982
This man trippin'.

34:13.016 --> 34:14.985
Oil slick! Oil slick!
Oil slick!

34:15.818 --> 34:17.120
<i> Deactivate.</i>

34:17.152 --> 34:19.130
<i>System shut down. Goodbye.</i>

34:19.155 --> 34:21.190
Oh, what did you do?

34:29.266 --> 34:31.434
He's like a god of the asphalt.

34:31.467 --> 34:32.636
We'll see about that.

34:36.539 --> 34:38.484
All right, all right.
I got this. I got this.

34:38.507 --> 34:39.543
I got this. I got this.

34:39.576 --> 34:40.809
We're gonna die!

34:40.844 --> 34:41.878
Oh, no.

34:41.879 --> 34:42.911
Watch out!

34:51.253 --> 34:53.322
We should be coming up on him
any second.

35:01.064 --> 35:02.833
This ends now.

35:02.866 --> 35:03.966
Is everyone in position?

35:04.000 --> 35:05.268
Affirmative.
In position.

35:05.302 --> 35:07.270
Walter, get that computer
back online.

35:07.304 --> 35:08.471
Systems coming back online.

35:08.505 --> 35:10.182
<i>Defensive applications online.</i>

35:10.206 --> 35:11.475
- Oil slick?
- Fine,

35:11.508 --> 35:12.575
Whatever! Just press it!

35:13.777 --> 35:14.887
Wait!
We're driving backwards.

35:14.911 --> 35:15.988
We're driving backwards.

35:44.708 --> 35:45.742
No!

35:58.422 --> 35:59.756
That was tight.

35:59.789 --> 36:02.158
Yep. It's official.
I'm a fan.

36:02.192 --> 36:05.728
Did anyone else
see a pigeon in that car?

36:06.630 --> 36:09.099
<i>Auto-drive engaged.</i>

36:10.833 --> 36:14.170
I can't help but feel
like some of this is my fault.

36:14.203 --> 36:17.739
Some? Joker,
this is all your fault.

36:17.774 --> 36:19.875
Airstrip. Now.

36:19.909 --> 36:21.010
I'm sorry. Jeez.

36:21.043 --> 36:22.878
Didn't mean to ruffle
your feathers.

36:22.912 --> 36:24.714
I hate you.

36:40.330 --> 36:43.533
Lovey, this is the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

36:43.566 --> 36:46.169
There are so many gadgets
I wanna test in the field.

36:46.202 --> 36:48.137
We got the binder bubbles,
collide-oscope,

36:48.171 --> 36:50.307
hypno-stars,
blamethrower, snorepedo.

36:50.340 --> 36:51.641
We've got the multi-pen.

36:51.674 --> 36:53.351
We haven't even tried
the multi-pen in the...

36:53.375 --> 36:55.545
I'm gonna need a code name.

36:55.579 --> 36:58.515
Bond. Hydrogen Bond.

36:58.548 --> 37:00.616
Oh, no, where is it?

37:00.650 --> 37:02.218
Wait! What is that?

37:02.251 --> 37:03.586
What is that?

37:04.872 --> 37:06.121
Oh! No, no.
Fly, fly, fly!

37:21.004 --> 37:23.607
Hey, everything go okay
in there?

37:23.640 --> 37:26.609
I just found out that
number one and number two...

37:26.643 --> 37:29.345
both come out of the same place.

37:29.379 --> 37:32.181
So, no.
Things are not okay.

37:32.215 --> 37:34.717
Yeah. It's called
a cloaca.

37:34.751 --> 37:36.353
It sounds weird and gross,

37:36.386 --> 37:37.987
but having a cloaca
just means...

37:38.020 --> 37:39.221
Dude!

37:39.255 --> 37:41.257
I know what it means.

37:41.290 --> 37:43.625
Saw it in the mirror.

37:43.659 --> 37:46.062
I know you're not
in a good place right now...

37:46.095 --> 37:49.132
but there are benefits
to being a pigeon.

37:49.165 --> 37:51.500
Okay, so read
what used to be my lips.

37:51.534 --> 37:53.469
You're only here, because A,

37:53.503 --> 37:55.838
I can't work a touchscreen
enough to eject you...

37:55.872 --> 38:00.076
and B, you're supposed to be
working on something, correct?

38:00.109 --> 38:01.744
Oh, the antidote.
Right. Sure.

38:01.777 --> 38:04.614
Yeah, that's going to take
18 hours to render.

38:04.647 --> 38:08.250
I'm stuck like this,
with this body, for 18...

38:08.284 --> 38:10.520
Ooh, boy...

38:10.553 --> 38:13.489
Whoo! Okay,
walk this one off.

38:24.934 --> 38:27.236
You know, being a pigeon

38:27.269 --> 38:30.206
is actually way cooler
than it seems.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.508
And if you just embrace
your new form,

38:32.541 --> 38:34.477
you'll see all the advantages.

38:34.510 --> 38:37.079
Like, fact, did you know

38:37.113 --> 38:39.382
that pigeons can see
in slow motion?

38:39.415 --> 38:40.882
Because, fact, pigeons can fly

38:40.917 --> 38:43.386
up to 92.7 miles
per hour.

38:43.419 --> 38:44.697
And, fact, pigeons are

38:44.721 --> 38:46.722
Highly intelligent animals
who like to play games.

38:46.756 --> 38:47.723
Oh, and, fact...

38:47.757 --> 38:50.527
Fact! You should have kept
your seat belt on.

38:50.827 --> 38:51.994
Whoo!

38:56.165 --> 38:58.067
Fact, pigeons can see
ultraviolet light...

38:58.101 --> 38:59.502
which is a broad
spectrum of light

38:59.535 --> 39:01.004
the human eye can't even see.

39:01.037 --> 39:02.739
Fact, pigeons are
a flock animal,

39:02.772 --> 39:04.174
which makes it easier
for them to...

39:18.654 --> 39:21.424
All right, Kimura,
I'm coming for you.

39:21.457 --> 39:24.127
Lance Sterling is on the scene.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.529
And Bond.
Hydrogen Bond.

39:28.931 --> 39:31.467
Dude, you need medicine.

39:35.739 --> 39:36.673
- Go, go, go!
- Hey!

39:36.706 --> 39:38.050
You just pushed me.

39:38.074 --> 39:40.510
All right, y'all better squad up,
'cause here comes the...

39:40.543 --> 39:42.745
Hey! Did you just
toe-poke me?

39:42.778 --> 39:46.383
You're a pigeon.
You can walk right past them.

39:46.983 --> 39:48.518
Oh. Huh.

39:51.821 --> 39:53.023
Just a regular old bird.

39:55.124 --> 39:56.793
Uh, that's not a pigeon sound.

39:56.826 --> 39:58.194
Till you grow a cloaca,

39:58.227 --> 39:59.796
I decide
what the bird sounds are.

40:03.333 --> 40:04.667
They're so stupid.

40:04.700 --> 40:06.335
You see, it's like
you're invisible.

40:06.368 --> 40:07.636
All right.

40:15.644 --> 40:17.247
Your room key, sir.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.548
Bingo.

40:18.581 --> 40:20.550
Okay, let's figure this out.
You and me. Let's go.

40:20.583 --> 40:23.285
Let's brainstorm.
How we gonna find this nut?

40:23.319 --> 40:26.121
Uh, you are gonna
sit down right here

40:26.155 --> 40:27.857
on this very nice couch.

40:27.890 --> 40:28.891
But I'm your wingman.

40:28.924 --> 40:31.761
Ooh, you know who needs
a wingman? That couch.

40:31.794 --> 40:34.462
Go sit your narrow behind down
and do some science stuff...

40:34.497 --> 40:37.400
and I'mma go find Kimura.
Alone.

40:38.234 --> 40:41.270
Oh, what is that heavenly smell?

40:41.304 --> 40:42.605
Mmm.

40:43.739 --> 40:45.041
Oh, no.

40:45.074 --> 40:46.876
Do not do it, Lance.

40:46.909 --> 40:48.211
Oh...

40:48.244 --> 40:50.513
Mmm. Lance!
Have some dignity.

40:52.215 --> 40:54.183
Walter, what is happening?

40:54.217 --> 40:57.220
It must be some sort of latent
avian instincts kicking in.

40:57.253 --> 40:59.089
Why am I eating food
off of the ground?

41:00.323 --> 41:02.058
Why does it taste amazing?

41:04.126 --> 41:06.596
Ugh. No, I'm good.
Thank you.

41:07.647 --> 41:08.663
Oh, wow.

41:08.697 --> 41:11.267
My dude, seriously,
give me 10 feet.

41:11.300 --> 41:13.336
Hey, no, human feet.
Back up.

41:13.369 --> 41:16.005
Oh, no.
I wish I could unsee that.

41:16.039 --> 41:18.374
This is huge. They've made you
part of their flock.

41:18.407 --> 41:20.276
I'm not trying to be
a part of nobody's flock.

41:20.310 --> 41:21.444
Shoo! Back up, fanboy.

41:22.612 --> 41:24.647
I don't care that your name is Jeff.
Beat it.

41:24.680 --> 41:25.915
You can understand them?

41:25.949 --> 41:27.049
What? No, no!

41:27.082 --> 41:28.527
- Does Lovey really love me?
- I'm not hearing bird-talk.

41:28.551 --> 41:29.862
Am I her best friend?

41:29.886 --> 41:31.187
None of this is right!

41:31.220 --> 41:32.455
Nice to meet you, Jeff.

41:32.488 --> 41:33.923
Stop talking to Jeff!

41:35.624 --> 41:36.559
Ugh.

41:56.913 --> 42:00.984
All right, what alias
are you using, Kimura?

42:04.921 --> 42:06.488
"Not Kimura."

42:06.522 --> 42:08.524
Wow. That's clever.

42:08.558 --> 42:10.893
I am way too good at this.

42:15.397 --> 42:16.799
Oh, come on.

42:16.832 --> 42:19.768
Seriously, fellas.
Not now.

42:19.802 --> 42:22.472
This is so humiliating.

42:23.806 --> 42:26.041
Hey, I'm not for the games.

42:26.075 --> 42:27.877
You better not...
Mmm-mmm.

42:28.911 --> 42:29.913
Stop it.

42:31.581 --> 42:33.483
Stop it! Stop!

42:35.618 --> 42:36.451
No!

42:36.486 --> 42:38.554
Stop it!
What is wrong with you?

42:42.858 --> 42:44.160
Oh.

43:05.814 --> 43:09.085
Well, would you look at that?
Being in a flock helped you.

43:09.118 --> 43:10.352
Not my flock!

43:10.385 --> 43:11.688
Lance...

43:11.721 --> 43:13.054
Lance.

43:13.088 --> 43:14.190
Wait, wait, wait. Uh...

43:14.224 --> 43:16.125
You should not
go up there alone.

43:16.158 --> 43:18.227
Maybe I have something else
that can help.

43:18.261 --> 43:22.431
Walter, I do not need your help.

43:22.464 --> 43:23.833
Never will.

43:26.769 --> 43:28.070
Can you push "20"
for me, please?

43:28.104 --> 43:29.380
I thought
you didn't need any help.

43:29.404 --> 43:30.473
I don't.

43:30.506 --> 43:31.616
- Feels like helping.
- Nope.

43:31.640 --> 43:32.751
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Didn't.

43:32.775 --> 43:33.927
Did!

43:33.928 --> 43:35.078
Did not!

44:09.111 --> 44:10.580
Who's there?

44:10.613 --> 44:13.449
Talk while you still have lips.

44:13.482 --> 44:14.684
Shut it, Kimura.

44:14.717 --> 44:17.287
Sterling.

44:18.187 --> 44:20.922
Uh-uh. Eyes front,
hands up.

44:20.956 --> 44:23.525
Ooh. Scratch that.
Pick up your towel.

44:23.559 --> 44:25.028
One hand up.

44:27.029 --> 44:28.264
What do you want?

44:28.297 --> 44:29.765
Here's how this works.

44:29.799 --> 44:32.435
I ask the questions, you answer.

44:32.468 --> 44:33.503
What?

44:33.536 --> 44:34.637
What?

44:34.671 --> 44:36.272
I don't know how to answer that.

44:36.305 --> 44:37.539
How did you get here?

44:37.573 --> 44:38.873
Huh? How did I...

44:38.907 --> 44:41.043
I'm not telling you anything.

44:41.076 --> 44:42.354
Stop! Get off of me.

44:42.378 --> 44:45.081
You sold the Assassin
to a guy with a robot hand.

44:45.114 --> 44:46.048
Where is he?

44:46.081 --> 44:47.783
He'll kill me
if I tell you that.

44:47.817 --> 44:50.320
Oh, and you think
I won't? Talk!

45:06.335 --> 45:07.402
Oh!

45:11.340 --> 45:14.476
All right, Kimura, 3 ounces of pressure
to the vagus nerve.

45:14.510 --> 45:16.045
Sleepy night-night!

45:20.550 --> 45:22.251
I miss my hands.

45:26.021 --> 45:27.923
Lance Sterling
is gonna die a pigeon...

45:27.957 --> 45:29.475
and be buried in a shoebox.

45:38.835 --> 45:40.403
Lance, are you okay?

45:40.903 --> 45:42.005
Walter?

45:45.040 --> 45:48.210
Sterling is here somewhere.
I want agents on every exit.

45:48.244 --> 45:49.612
And everyone be careful.

45:49.645 --> 45:51.381
This is Lance Sterling
we're dealing with.

45:52.381 --> 45:53.916
Tell me where Robo Hand is.

45:53.949 --> 45:54.817
Never.

45:54.851 --> 45:57.887
Boy, I'm about to
pigeon-wing-slap...

45:59.922 --> 46:02.057
Oh. Oh, tough guy.
Okay.

46:02.091 --> 46:03.826
Then we do it the hard way.

46:03.859 --> 46:05.661
Walter, I need a funnel,

46:05.694 --> 46:07.295
jumper cables,
and a Nickelback album.

46:07.329 --> 46:08.364
Nickelback?

46:08.397 --> 46:10.165
What?
But that would hurt him.

46:10.199 --> 46:11.734
That's the whole point.

46:12.267 --> 46:13.436
I know what to do.

46:15.404 --> 46:16.572
No, no, no.

46:16.606 --> 46:18.073
- Don't do that.
- Ooh.

46:18.107 --> 46:19.775
That's what
I'm talking about, Walter.

46:19.808 --> 46:21.043
Go science on this fool!

46:21.077 --> 46:22.445
Oh, yeah!

46:22.478 --> 46:24.380
I'm gonna science
all over your face.

46:24.414 --> 46:26.249
Please, don't!

46:29.919 --> 46:32.587
Did you just give that man
a refreshing spritz?

46:32.621 --> 46:34.456
It's a truth serum, but yes,

46:34.490 --> 46:36.058
it has a lavender quality to it.

46:36.091 --> 46:36.958
Watch.

46:36.993 --> 46:39.395
Kimura,
what's your biggest secret?

46:39.428 --> 46:41.563
I peed in the pool.

46:41.596 --> 46:43.465
That's a lot of honesty.

46:43.499 --> 46:46.468
Who is Robo Hand?
And why is he wearing my face?

46:46.501 --> 46:47.803
I don't know who he is.

46:47.836 --> 46:49.138
Then what do you know?

46:49.171 --> 46:50.740
Well, I know
how to play the flute.

46:50.773 --> 46:52.140
About Robo Hand!

46:52.174 --> 46:54.342
I know he's on his way
to Venice right now

46:54.377 --> 46:55.844
to steal the Agent Database.

46:55.877 --> 46:57.545
He's going to kill me.

46:57.579 --> 46:59.115
- Agent Database?
- Database.

46:59.148 --> 47:00.491
Who says "database"?

47:00.515 --> 47:01.750
Shut up.

47:01.784 --> 47:04.920
He'll know the identities
of everyone at the Agency.

47:04.953 --> 47:06.922
And once he does...

47:06.956 --> 47:10.793
he'll use the Assassin
to eliminate all of them.

47:10.826 --> 47:11.944
Not if I stop him first.

47:15.064 --> 47:17.566
She is relentless.

47:17.599 --> 47:19.402
Block the door.
We need something heavy.

47:20.302 --> 47:21.738
I'm heavy.

47:23.873 --> 47:25.007
Are you pulling?

47:25.040 --> 47:27.109
Of course I'm pulling!
Why aren't you pushing?

47:27.142 --> 47:28.253
Just put your weight behind it.

47:28.277 --> 47:30.813
I am putting my weight!
I'm feathers!

47:33.816 --> 47:36.986
It's like a big bag
of pudding!

47:40.556 --> 47:41.724
Ugh. Yuck.

47:41.757 --> 47:44.260
This is so embarrassing.

47:46.662 --> 47:48.731
Come on, Walter.
Use your glutes.

47:50.399 --> 47:51.799
You're out of moves, Sterling.

47:51.833 --> 47:53.603
You and Beckett
are wanted for treason.

47:53.636 --> 47:54.936
We gotta go. Now.

47:54.970 --> 47:56.438
No. Don't leave me
like this.

47:56.471 --> 47:57.873
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

47:57.906 --> 47:59.608
- Ears?
- Consider it done.

48:03.545 --> 48:05.523
We gotta get to that balcony.
We're gonna have to parkour.

48:05.547 --> 48:06.582
What?

48:06.615 --> 48:08.116
Cat pass! Tic-tac!
Jelly roll!

48:08.150 --> 48:09.785
Desk lamp!
Flimflam! Bottle cap!

48:09.819 --> 48:11.554
I don't know
what any of that means.

48:16.959 --> 48:18.160
Hi.

48:18.193 --> 48:20.162
What the... What happened
to you?

48:20.195 --> 48:22.297
Oh, don't do that.
You're gonna make me...

48:24.166 --> 48:26.135
Now or never, Walter.
Gotta go! Come on, Walter!

48:26.169 --> 48:27.236
You can do this!

48:27.269 --> 48:29.438
Okay, it's a physics problem,
Walter. Come on.

48:29.472 --> 48:30.840
It's basic physics!

48:30.873 --> 48:32.607
It's just basic physics.

48:37.413 --> 48:39.181
You're right.

48:39.214 --> 48:40.882
- We can do this.
- Beckett!

48:40.916 --> 48:42.394
- We can do this.
- Beckett, don't you...

48:42.418 --> 48:43.619
We're gonna do this!

48:43.653 --> 48:44.854
We can do this!

48:52.928 --> 48:54.897
Use your gadgets!

48:54.930 --> 48:56.932
Use your gadgets!

48:56.965 --> 48:59.035
A-ha! Grappling hook!

49:00.102 --> 49:03.005
Fly! Fly!
What am I doing wrong?

49:06.007 --> 49:07.610
There he is!

49:11.814 --> 49:14.116
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

49:20.489 --> 49:22.225
Well, that's not good.

49:27.229 --> 49:28.130
Oh!

49:28.163 --> 49:29.908
Walter, what else
you got on that pen?

49:31.500 --> 49:32.501
No.

49:38.040 --> 49:40.342
Oh, hello, soft landing.

49:40.709 --> 49:42.178
Oh! Whoa!

49:42.878 --> 49:44.447
Walter!

49:57.092 --> 49:58.236
Go, go, go!

49:58.260 --> 49:59.829
Oh, these guys
are the worst.

49:59.862 --> 50:00.939
- There he is!
- Don't move!

50:00.963 --> 50:02.631
The multi-pen!

50:02.665 --> 50:04.300
Yes! Great.
Shoot 'em!

50:06.001 --> 50:07.937
Well, that is suboptimal.

50:07.970 --> 50:10.306
That has a bit of
a suck factor to it.

50:14.209 --> 50:16.511
Yeah, pillow.
Good call.

50:19.448 --> 50:21.484
Lance, get down.

50:22.517 --> 50:23.619
Get down!

50:28.858 --> 50:30.426
Huh?

50:32.694 --> 50:34.563
Serious string.

50:34.596 --> 50:36.799
Like Silly String, but serious.

50:36.832 --> 50:37.950
Oddly effective.

50:40.571 --> 50:42.038
Come on, let's ghost.

50:43.005 --> 50:44.873
There's something
you don't see every day.

50:44.907 --> 50:47.376
Wow. This is tripped out.

50:47.409 --> 50:49.945
This is...
I don't know what this is.

50:49.978 --> 50:52.013
This couldn't
have been Sterling.

50:52.047 --> 50:53.582
No one's even hurt.

50:53.615 --> 50:55.150
It might be that kid, Beckett.

50:55.183 --> 50:56.819
But that doesn't make sense!

50:56.852 --> 50:59.621
Beckett is just some nobody
in the gadget lab.

50:59.655 --> 51:00.889
Well, according to his file,

51:00.922 --> 51:03.391
that "nobody"
graduated MIT at 15...

51:03.425 --> 51:06.662
and invented a way
to edit human genomes

51:06.695 --> 51:08.130
in middle school.

51:08.163 --> 51:09.315
Dude is <i> Jeopardy!</i> smart.

51:10.499 --> 51:12.268
Well, so are we.

51:14.169 --> 51:16.071
I stepped in it.

51:16.104 --> 51:17.406
I stepped in the goo.

51:17.439 --> 51:19.140
Yeah, me, too.

51:19.174 --> 51:21.978
These are my new kicks, man.

51:30.786 --> 51:31.820
I hope this works.

51:31.854 --> 51:33.098
I hope this works.
I hope this works.

51:33.122 --> 51:35.591
Please, please, please.

51:43.933 --> 51:46.001
<i>Weapons system online.</i>

51:46.034 --> 51:48.003
<i>Agent Database
required for targeting.</i>

51:48.037 --> 51:49.204
It's done!

51:49.238 --> 51:52.942
The entire facility
is running at full capacity.

51:52.975 --> 51:54.543
Everything is exactly
how you wanted it.

51:55.677 --> 51:59.448
But, please, the destruction
this is capable of...

52:00.516 --> 52:03.252
Since when does your agency care

52:03.285 --> 52:07.422
about the many, many,
many lives it destroys?

52:07.456 --> 52:10.125
No!
Wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!

52:10.159 --> 52:12.928
No, please, please!
Wait, wait, wait!

52:12.962 --> 52:15.097
You said if I helped you,
you'd let me go.

52:15.130 --> 52:18.534
Oh, yeah, I did.
Didn't I?

52:21.403 --> 52:24.507
I hear Venice is wonderful
this time of year.

52:31.981 --> 52:33.248
Aw, yeah.

52:33.282 --> 52:34.983
Just wait till I get to Venice.

52:35.017 --> 52:37.185
I'mma tear that fool
his own cloaca.

52:39.020 --> 52:40.222
Walter!

52:40.956 --> 52:42.358
- Walter!
- Huh? What?

52:42.391 --> 52:44.460
You're still working
on that antidote, right?

52:44.960 --> 52:46.261
Working on it?

52:46.294 --> 52:47.763
In a couple minutes, it's done.

52:48.898 --> 52:50.899
But do you know
what else is working?

52:50.933 --> 52:52.333
If you say being a pigeon...

52:52.367 --> 52:53.903
Being a pigeon!

52:53.936 --> 52:55.970
I'm really gonna
throw this boy in the ocean.

52:56.004 --> 52:57.048
What?

52:57.072 --> 52:58.840
Hey, how did y'all get here?

52:58.873 --> 53:01.543
Jeff and Crazy Eyes
aren't going to abandon you.

53:01.576 --> 53:02.727
They're part of your flock.

53:02.728 --> 53:03.878
Come on. No.

53:03.912 --> 53:05.014
Get your beak out my drink.

53:05.047 --> 53:06.557
I have no idea
where that beak has been.

53:06.581 --> 53:07.549
Back out.

53:07.582 --> 53:08.750
No! Stop it!

53:08.751 --> 53:09.917
Okay, okay.

53:09.951 --> 53:11.019
Here you go, guys.
Come on.

53:11.052 --> 53:13.188
Have some of these.
They're gluten-free.

53:13.222 --> 53:14.323
You're joking, right?

53:14.356 --> 53:16.992
That one ate gum
stuck to a tissue.

53:21.163 --> 53:22.563
And a spy pen.

53:22.598 --> 53:24.766
We should probably
do something about that.

53:27.169 --> 53:28.502
It's ready.

53:28.536 --> 53:30.004
Finally.

53:40.815 --> 53:42.317
May I?

53:42.351 --> 53:44.587
Not this time, Lovey.
Thank you.

53:44.953 --> 53:46.054
Ow!

53:46.088 --> 53:47.523
Joker.

54:02.638 --> 54:04.105
Well, that's not good.

54:04.139 --> 54:06.675
"Not good" as in it'll taste bad

54:06.708 --> 54:08.577
but still turn me back
into a human?

54:08.610 --> 54:10.546
Mmm, "not good" as in
it won't turn you

54:10.579 --> 54:11.780
back into a human...

54:11.813 --> 54:13.925
and if you drink it,
all your cells will catch on fire.

54:13.949 --> 54:15.017
Come on, man!

54:15.050 --> 54:16.785
I'm sorry.
I'll figure it out.

54:16.818 --> 54:18.120
Science is all trial and error.

54:18.153 --> 54:20.122
This isn't a science lab.

54:20.155 --> 54:23.258
If I don't stop this guy,
people will die!

54:23.291 --> 54:25.036
You don't think
that I want to stop him, too?

54:25.060 --> 54:26.661
Why do you think
I'm on this boat?

54:26.695 --> 54:28.697
Do you have any idea

54:28.730 --> 54:31.466
of how much motion sickness
medication I'm on right now?

54:31.500 --> 54:35.070
I can hardly feel my legs!

54:35.104 --> 54:38.340
But I'm here
because I believe...

54:38.373 --> 54:43.913
together, we can find
a good way to stop the bad.

54:46.915 --> 54:48.683
I know you do, man.

54:49.852 --> 54:52.487
But it's a fantasy.

54:52.521 --> 54:56.825
When the bad guys hit you,
you hit 'em back.

54:56.859 --> 55:01.096
You hit 'em so hard
that they don't get back up.

55:01.129 --> 55:04.466
You gotta fight fire with fire.

55:04.500 --> 55:09.271
When we fight fire with fire,
we all get burned.

55:09.305 --> 55:12.274
There's no good guys
or bad guys.

55:12.741 --> 55:13.876
Just people.

55:15.911 --> 55:18.214
And people are worth saving.

55:18.847 --> 55:20.382
Isn't that our job?

55:22.083 --> 55:26.422
Evil doesn't care
that you're nice.

55:31.159 --> 55:35.997
I watch good people
be taken every day.

55:38.133 --> 55:40.236
But you wouldn't know
nothing about that.

55:44.873 --> 55:46.609
You'd be surprised.

56:10.499 --> 56:12.167
First time in Venice?

56:12.201 --> 56:13.869
First time anywhere, really.

56:13.902 --> 56:15.137
It's always been my dream

56:15.170 --> 56:17.272
to come here
and feed the pigeons.

56:17.305 --> 56:18.985
You need help.

56:25.613 --> 56:27.415
Time to put
your game face on.

56:27.448 --> 56:29.083
That's the Agency Data Vault.

56:29.118 --> 56:30.461
Data Vault.

56:30.485 --> 56:33.121
If Robo Hand wants
a list of agents,

56:33.154 --> 56:35.023
that's where he'll find it.

56:35.057 --> 56:36.758
- You remember the plan?
- What plan?

56:36.791 --> 56:38.536
You said, "Stay out of the way
and let me kick some..."

56:38.560 --> 56:39.795
Good. You remember it.

56:41.630 --> 56:43.832
Long way
from home, Walter.

56:44.266 --> 56:45.767
Kimura talked.

56:45.800 --> 56:48.970
I know Sterling's here
in Venice. Where is he?

56:49.004 --> 56:50.706
Stay cool.

56:51.940 --> 56:53.342
Where's Sterling?

56:53.375 --> 56:55.977
I can tell you where he's not.

56:56.010 --> 56:58.613
Which is right here.

56:59.581 --> 57:02.417
What? No,
we can't just kill her.

57:02.451 --> 57:04.420
That's dark, Lovey.

57:04.453 --> 57:08.156
Look, I know
you're not a criminal.

57:08.189 --> 57:11.360
You're a bright kid.

57:11.393 --> 57:15.764
You're inventing things that
nobody has ever thought of.

57:15.798 --> 57:19.101
I know because my boot is
still stuck in one of 'em.

57:19.134 --> 57:20.534
Sorry.

57:20.568 --> 57:24.540
No, no. We're the ones
who owe you an apology.

57:24.573 --> 57:28.143
You're trying to keep
the world safe...

57:28.176 --> 57:30.078
just like your mother did.

57:32.414 --> 57:34.316
I read your file.

57:34.349 --> 57:38.921
I know she sacrificed her life
to save people.

57:41.122 --> 57:43.257
I can help you, Walter.

57:43.291 --> 57:45.527
I can get you your job back.

57:45.560 --> 57:48.864
A new lab.
All the equipment you need.

57:49.998 --> 57:52.500
Show them what you can do...

57:52.534 --> 57:57.072
and no one will
ever call you weird again.

57:59.240 --> 58:01.877
You just have
to give me Sterling.

58:04.112 --> 58:05.714
No.

58:05.747 --> 58:07.716
We should
all be working together.

58:09.317 --> 58:10.402
Bad move, Beckett.

58:12.454 --> 58:13.488
Sterling!

58:14.890 --> 58:16.958
Stay here.

58:16.992 --> 58:18.594
Let's go.

58:22.698 --> 58:24.466
- It's the Assassin.
- Come on.

58:24.499 --> 58:25.634
Destroy the target!

58:25.667 --> 58:26.944
We can't let that thing
out of here.

58:26.968 --> 58:28.069
Open fire!

58:28.102 --> 58:29.213
It's got the database.

58:30.405 --> 58:31.606
Oh, man.

58:31.639 --> 58:32.974
It's not working!

58:33.008 --> 58:34.108
I'm on it.

58:36.377 --> 58:37.745
This is not good!

58:37.779 --> 58:39.481
- Take cover!
- Now!

58:48.423 --> 58:50.192
- Let's go.
- Beckett, don't you...

58:50.225 --> 58:51.735
- Don't worry. We'll stop it.
- Beckett!

58:51.759 --> 58:54.897
I mean, I'll stop it,
because Lance is definitely not here.

59:02.470 --> 59:03.872
We can't catch this thing
on foot.

59:03.905 --> 59:05.307
Whoa, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

59:05.340 --> 59:06.474
You're a pigeon, Lance.

59:06.507 --> 59:07.685
You're one of the fastest
birds in the world.

59:07.709 --> 59:09.177
No, put me down, Walter!

59:09.210 --> 59:11.112
You need to fly!
I believe in you.

59:11.145 --> 59:12.280
There's another way!

59:12.314 --> 59:15.083
Boy, don't you throw me
off this roof!

59:17.519 --> 59:19.020
He'll figure it out.

59:22.190 --> 59:23.992
Come on.
I'm gonna die.

59:28.463 --> 59:29.664
I'm flying.

59:29.698 --> 59:31.866
I'm flying.

59:31.900 --> 59:32.734
I'm flying...

59:32.768 --> 59:34.069
Oh, you're flying me.

59:35.403 --> 59:37.238
Thank you.
Good looking out.

59:37.272 --> 59:38.806
Whoa!

59:39.875 --> 59:42.710
Whoa. All right, guys.
Let's go!

59:42.744 --> 59:44.345
We got an Assassin to catch.

59:44.379 --> 59:46.013
Excuse me.
Sorry.

59:49.251 --> 59:50.686
That works, too.

59:50.719 --> 59:52.754
- This is official business!
- Oh.

59:56.524 --> 59:58.594
Okay.

01:00:01.163 --> 01:00:02.797
Phew.

01:00:04.766 --> 01:00:06.835
This is official business!

01:00:07.736 --> 01:00:09.402
We need to get that database.

01:00:09.437 --> 01:00:10.471
Any ideas?

01:00:12.206 --> 01:00:14.276
Oh! I like how you think.

01:00:16.111 --> 01:00:17.279
Bullseye!

01:00:17.312 --> 01:00:18.513
Got it.

01:00:22.084 --> 01:00:24.620
Yeah, didn't think
he'd like that.

01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:26.822
Good job.

01:00:28.557 --> 01:00:31.059
Oh, that's right.
You all like games.

01:00:31.093 --> 01:00:32.728
Let's play some Keep Away.

01:00:33.828 --> 01:00:34.830
Go long.

01:00:36.965 --> 01:00:38.600
Oh, no!

01:00:47.342 --> 01:00:49.678
Not so easy,
is it, Roomba?

01:00:51.579 --> 01:00:53.949
Lovey, all you, girl!

01:00:54.449 --> 01:00:55.918
Hit me. I'm open.

01:00:56.551 --> 01:00:57.986
I got it! I got it!

01:00:58.019 --> 01:00:59.021
Oh, no.

01:01:11.499 --> 01:01:13.702
Oh, no, no, no!

01:01:13.735 --> 01:01:14.937
This is about to suck!

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.873
No!

01:01:19.908 --> 01:01:21.810
Come on, come on, come on!

01:01:27.315 --> 01:01:29.184
Catch of the century!

01:01:29.217 --> 01:01:31.419
I've never caught anything
in my whole life!

01:01:36.558 --> 01:01:38.359
That was amazing.
We did it!

01:01:38.392 --> 01:01:39.470
We're gonna talk about

01:01:39.494 --> 01:01:40.704
you throwing me
off that roof, though.

01:01:40.728 --> 01:01:42.473
Yeah, I really thought
that would work out better.

01:01:42.497 --> 01:01:43.598
Nah, it's cool, it's cool.

01:01:43.631 --> 01:01:44.842
We're gonna holler
about it in a minute.

01:01:44.866 --> 01:01:46.477
You know, I'm gonna let you
have this moment.

01:01:46.501 --> 01:01:48.370
Whoo! We're unstoppable...

01:02:04.586 --> 01:02:06.087
Uh-uh-uh.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.323
That belongs to me.

01:02:08.356 --> 01:02:13.027
Technically, it belongs to
the United States government.

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:17.966
Lance! Lance!

01:02:18.667 --> 01:02:20.469
Sterling?

01:02:20.502 --> 01:02:22.871
What do you say, Lance?

01:02:22.904 --> 01:02:26.208
Come out.
We'll have some good fun.

01:02:26.241 --> 01:02:28.210
You're the hero, right?

01:02:28.243 --> 01:02:31.011
The spy who saves the day...

01:02:31.046 --> 01:02:35.117
destroying anybody
that stands in your way.

01:02:38.019 --> 01:02:40.022
Oh, I'd love to have some fun.

01:02:43.224 --> 01:02:44.526
Guess he's not coming.

01:02:44.559 --> 01:02:47.162
No.

01:02:48.463 --> 01:02:50.531
Ah, life's full
of disappointment.

01:02:52.634 --> 01:02:54.369
You don't have
to do it this way.

01:02:54.402 --> 01:02:55.870
It won't make anything better.

01:02:55.904 --> 01:02:57.071
No.

01:02:57.104 --> 01:02:58.205
No!

01:02:59.607 --> 01:03:01.109
Walter!

01:03:20.294 --> 01:03:21.763
Breadcrumbs?

01:03:26.468 --> 01:03:28.503
They're gluten-free.

01:03:34.776 --> 01:03:36.378
Lance, let's go.

01:03:43.418 --> 01:03:44.870
Hold it right there!

01:03:46.354 --> 01:03:48.790
Turn around nice and slow!

01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:52.094
Hands where I can see them.

01:03:57.231 --> 01:03:59.201
Both hands.

01:04:00.368 --> 01:04:01.803
Watch out!

01:04:04.906 --> 01:04:09.477
Did anybody else
see that Agent Sterling had...

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:12.047
A robot hand?

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.448
Yeah.

01:04:20.889 --> 01:04:23.257
Phew.
Totally crazy.

01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:25.594
When he had his foot
on my head, I was like...

01:04:25.627 --> 01:04:26.994
And you were like, "No!"

01:04:27.028 --> 01:04:28.996
And then, I was like,
"Breadcrumbs!"

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:31.599
He still got away
with the database.

01:04:31.633 --> 01:04:33.601
Or did he?

01:04:33.635 --> 01:04:37.005
Or did he?

01:04:37.806 --> 01:04:39.807
Or did he?

01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:41.643
I feel like you want me to say,

01:04:41.676 --> 01:04:42.810
"What are you
talking about?"

01:04:42.843 --> 01:04:44.678
Oh, I'll tell you
what I'm talking about.

01:04:44.712 --> 01:04:47.582
During the whole
bird-nado thing,

01:04:47.615 --> 01:04:49.017
I put a tracker on him.

01:04:49.851 --> 01:04:51.653
Wait. That's him?

01:04:51.686 --> 01:04:53.321
That's Robo Hand?

01:04:53.354 --> 01:04:54.439
Yep.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.523
Yes!

01:04:55.556 --> 01:04:56.991
Yes! My man!

01:04:57.025 --> 01:04:58.726
Oh, there is no way

01:04:58.759 --> 01:05:00.461
I could have done this
without you, Walter.

01:05:00.495 --> 01:05:01.579
What?

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.663
What?

01:05:02.697 --> 01:05:03.899
What did you say?

01:05:03.932 --> 01:05:05.166
I think I said...

01:05:05.199 --> 01:05:07.803
You said you couldn't
have done it without me.

01:05:20.748 --> 01:05:22.117
All right.

01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:24.252
Okay, we've reached
the time limit on this, Walter.

01:05:24.285 --> 01:05:26.721
All right, hey, hey,
will you stop?

01:05:26.755 --> 01:05:28.856
You're squeezing too...

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:30.292
Oh! Whoa!

01:05:38.266 --> 01:05:41.803
Walter, what happens
in the submarine

01:05:41.836 --> 01:05:43.738
stays in the submarine.

01:05:43.772 --> 01:05:45.140
You just laid an egg.

01:05:45.173 --> 01:05:46.707
You laid an egg!

01:05:46.741 --> 01:05:48.909
It just kinda
slipped out, man.

01:05:48.943 --> 01:05:50.445
You just laid an egg!

01:05:50.478 --> 01:05:52.080
Lance, this is amazing.

01:05:52.113 --> 01:05:53.648
Do you not realize
what this means?

01:05:53.682 --> 01:05:54.782
You're a girl!

01:05:54.816 --> 01:05:55.950
Oh! Excuse me?

01:05:55.984 --> 01:05:57.252
Of course, of course.

01:05:57.285 --> 01:05:58.887
That's why
I couldn't figure this out.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.823
I used Lovey's DNA in the serum.

01:06:01.856 --> 01:06:03.758
And that helps us how?

01:06:03.791 --> 01:06:05.326
Because now all I need to do

01:06:05.359 --> 01:06:07.627
is change one variable
in the antidote...

01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:09.130
and you'll be human again.

01:06:09.731 --> 01:06:11.532
I'm gonna be me.

01:06:11.565 --> 01:06:13.400
Unless, you know,

01:06:13.434 --> 01:06:16.137
maybe you wanna stay
a pigeon a little longer.

01:06:17.805 --> 01:06:19.007
Right.

01:06:19.707 --> 01:06:20.942
Of course.

01:06:20.975 --> 01:06:23.277
One antidote coming right up.

01:06:35.056 --> 01:06:37.891
Director Jenkins,
we lost the database.

01:06:37.926 --> 01:06:39.960
Every Agency employee
is compromised.

01:06:39.994 --> 01:06:42.196
You need to pull everyone in
for their own safety.

01:06:43.931 --> 01:06:45.699
<i>And you're sure it was Lance?</i>

01:06:45.733 --> 01:06:47.168
Yes.

01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:48.236
Maybe?

01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:50.906
Okay, I don't know what I saw.

01:06:51.573 --> 01:06:54.208
But I still know for a fact

01:06:54.242 --> 01:06:56.043
that Sterling came here
on this boat.

01:06:56.077 --> 01:06:57.521
Sterling wasn't on this boat.

01:06:57.545 --> 01:06:58.446
Son of a...

01:06:58.479 --> 01:07:01.215
Come on!
There's gotta be something.

01:07:01.249 --> 01:07:03.351
A footprint, a candy wrapper,

01:07:03.384 --> 01:07:05.053
some overpriced face lotion...

01:07:05.086 --> 01:07:06.287
because there is no way

01:07:06.321 --> 01:07:08.256
that his skin looks
that good without help.

01:07:08.289 --> 01:07:10.024
Look, everything is
coming up blank.

01:07:10.058 --> 01:07:11.559
If Sterling was on this boat...

01:07:11.592 --> 01:07:12.993
he didn't leave a fingerprint,

01:07:13.027 --> 01:07:15.162
his lips never touched
a glass...

01:07:15.196 --> 01:07:18.632
and somehow he didn't have feet.

01:07:20.234 --> 01:07:21.502
<i>I think it's safe to say that</i>

01:07:21.535 --> 01:07:24.539
<i>your investigation
isn't getting anywhere.</i>

01:07:29.277 --> 01:07:30.345
Huh.

01:08:43.651 --> 01:08:44.752
Lance?

01:08:47.321 --> 01:08:48.356
Lance?

01:08:49.156 --> 01:08:50.725
Oh...

01:08:50.758 --> 01:08:51.859
Did it work?

01:08:51.893 --> 01:08:52.961
Okay, take it easy.

01:08:58.531 --> 01:09:00.301
I got my hands back.

01:09:00.667 --> 01:09:02.370
Yes! Yes!

01:09:02.402 --> 01:09:03.837
Oh, my pecs.

01:09:03.871 --> 01:09:06.038
My pectoral muscles.
My abdominalia.

01:09:06.073 --> 01:09:09.410
Oh, Walter, you are a...

01:09:09.444 --> 01:09:10.444
I just...

01:09:11.312 --> 01:09:13.747
I can do that
'cause I got lips now!

01:09:15.082 --> 01:09:16.817
I'm naked.

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:18.252
Little bit awkward.

01:09:18.285 --> 01:09:20.154
Lucky for you, I planned ahead.

01:09:20.187 --> 01:09:21.389
Good call.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.361
There he is.

01:09:27.395 --> 01:09:28.828
Lance Sterling.
Back in action.

01:09:30.231 --> 01:09:32.466
<i> You have
arrived at your destination.</i>

01:09:33.267 --> 01:09:34.669
All right, Robo Hand.

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:37.337
I'm coming for you.

01:10:06.267 --> 01:10:09.904
Okay. Robo Hand
is a mile due west.

01:10:09.937 --> 01:10:11.372
So, what's the plan, partner?

01:10:11.406 --> 01:10:14.842
I got plenty of glitter,
yay-palm, a splat-a-pult...

01:10:14.875 --> 01:10:16.377
No.

01:10:16.410 --> 01:10:17.378
No what?

01:10:17.412 --> 01:10:19.246
I'm taking it from here, Walter.

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.748
You're kidding, right?

01:10:20.782 --> 01:10:22.516
Look, lives are on the line.

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:23.650
I got this now.

01:10:23.685 --> 01:10:25.086
You've got this?

01:10:25.119 --> 01:10:27.255
But we're a team.
You said so yourself.

01:10:27.288 --> 01:10:28.656
And you did your job.

01:10:28.689 --> 01:10:30.057
You un-birded me.

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:32.860
Now it's time
to do things my way.

01:10:32.893 --> 01:10:34.862
End this fool.

01:10:34.895 --> 01:10:36.530
That's wrong.

01:10:36.564 --> 01:10:38.199
You're so wrong.

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:39.633
Look, I've got
everything that we...

01:10:39.667 --> 01:10:43.304
This is not the place
for your weird gadgets.

01:10:44.872 --> 01:10:46.207
Weird?

01:10:49.943 --> 01:10:51.579
Go home.

01:10:55.349 --> 01:10:56.351
No.

01:10:57.051 --> 01:10:59.521
I'm not giving up. Ow.

01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:05.793
Lance...

01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:08.830
I can't lose
any more good people.

01:11:21.876 --> 01:11:23.477
I fly solo.

01:12:22.236 --> 01:12:23.771
Ow!

01:13:00.474 --> 01:13:02.510
I think that's yours.

01:13:02.543 --> 01:13:06.179
But that face
you've been using is mine.

01:13:06.213 --> 01:13:07.581
It's over.

01:13:07.614 --> 01:13:09.784
Database isn't gonna
do you any good

01:13:09.817 --> 01:13:12.386
with your fancy toy
messed up like that.

01:13:14.688 --> 01:13:18.458
You really thought
I was gonna use one drone...

01:13:18.493 --> 01:13:21.696
to take out every name
on this list?

01:13:22.664 --> 01:13:24.332
I mean, I did.

01:13:24.365 --> 01:13:27.034
Until you asked
that question that way.

01:13:27.067 --> 01:13:28.469
Casts a little doubt.

01:13:28.502 --> 01:13:30.405
Tell me, Agent Sterling.

01:13:33.674 --> 01:13:35.643
You managed to stop one drone.

01:13:39.413 --> 01:13:41.983
How do you plan
on stopping 1,000?

01:13:53.795 --> 01:13:55.697
Sleepy night-night.

01:14:08.008 --> 01:14:09.109
Huh?

01:14:16.584 --> 01:14:18.219
Do you feel
that dread?

01:14:18.252 --> 01:14:19.787
Oh, can you feel it?

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:25.193
Rolling around you like a fog.

01:14:25.226 --> 01:14:27.328
I told you.
I don't even know you, man.

01:14:27.361 --> 01:14:30.465
But I know you.

01:14:30.498 --> 01:14:31.899
Think about it.

01:14:32.633 --> 01:14:33.534
No?

01:14:33.568 --> 01:14:35.403
I'll give you
a little bit of help.

01:14:38.472 --> 01:14:39.907
Kyrgyzstan.

01:14:41.375 --> 01:14:43.010
Ah...

01:14:43.044 --> 01:14:44.511
He remembers.

01:14:44.544 --> 01:14:47.081
I mean, I certainly
never forgot that day.

01:14:47.114 --> 01:14:49.951
You were magnificent.

01:14:49.984 --> 01:14:52.084
You were a one-man army.

01:14:52.119 --> 01:14:53.855
Lot of witty catchphrases...

01:14:53.888 --> 01:14:58.826
and you had all these fancy toys
that just went boom!

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.062
Boom.

01:15:03.163 --> 01:15:04.966
Boom.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.836
You were a bunch of bad dudes

01:15:08.869 --> 01:15:11.738
about to hurt
a lot of innocent people.

01:15:11.772 --> 01:15:15.142
And it's my job
to keep everyone safe.

01:15:15.175 --> 01:15:17.811
Everyone?

01:15:19.113 --> 01:15:25.418
I watched every single one
of my people die...

01:15:25.453 --> 01:15:30.658
as your agency's weapons
rained down on us.

01:15:34.428 --> 01:15:37.031
You took everything from me.

01:15:40.267 --> 01:15:42.470
And you know the rules.

01:15:44.405 --> 01:15:47.074
You hit me hard, Sterling.

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:52.547
I hit back harder.

01:16:04.592 --> 01:16:06.461
All of this...

01:16:09.163 --> 01:16:11.866
because of you.

01:16:23.577 --> 01:16:25.680
He's coming back for me.

01:16:28.048 --> 01:16:30.951
Walter, no.
No, no, no.

01:16:30.985 --> 01:16:32.019
Walter.

01:16:32.052 --> 01:16:34.121
No, no, no.
Okay.

01:16:39.293 --> 01:16:42.596
Hey, this kid is harmless.

01:16:42.629 --> 01:16:45.299
He doesn't have anything
to do with this, okay?

01:16:45.332 --> 01:16:46.432
We can figure this out.

01:16:46.466 --> 01:16:47.568
Look at me, look at me.

01:16:47.601 --> 01:16:49.569
I'm sorry, all right?

01:16:49.603 --> 01:16:51.104
There's another way!

01:16:51.138 --> 01:16:52.139
Do you hear me?

01:16:56.777 --> 01:16:58.513
Do not hurt this kid.

01:17:02.449 --> 01:17:03.550
Oh, no.

01:17:03.584 --> 01:17:04.819
Don't...
Don't do this.

01:17:05.786 --> 01:17:06.787
Please.

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:07.788
No, no, no.

01:17:07.821 --> 01:17:09.590
- Don't do this!
- No!

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.629
No!

01:17:20.934 --> 01:17:23.838
I'm taking
everything from you.

01:18:52.259 --> 01:18:53.327
Huh?

01:18:58.932 --> 01:19:01.301
Oh, right. Yeah.

01:19:02.569 --> 01:19:04.538
Walter.

01:19:04.571 --> 01:19:06.006
But I saw...

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.041
How did you...

01:19:07.074 --> 01:19:09.677
Oh, you know,
one of my weird gadgets.

01:19:10.678 --> 01:19:13.014
The inflatable hug.

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.750
Thought I lost you, man.

01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:19.553
I'll always have
your back, Lance.

01:19:19.586 --> 01:19:22.023
That's what it means
to be a team.

01:19:22.889 --> 01:19:25.959
It's something I learned
a long time ago.

01:19:28.262 --> 01:19:29.263
From your mom?

01:19:32.833 --> 01:19:34.869
You're a good friend, Walter.

01:19:39.473 --> 01:19:43.877
And, hey,
I'm sorry for shooting you
in your neck.

01:19:43.911 --> 01:19:46.947
I'm sorry for the cloaca.

01:19:48.849 --> 01:19:52.151
So, what's your plan
to stop this guy?

01:19:52.185 --> 01:19:53.820
Nope. Not my plan.

01:19:53.853 --> 01:19:55.356
Time to do it your way.

01:19:56.256 --> 01:19:57.222
My way?

01:19:57.257 --> 01:19:59.626
Oh, yeah. We about
to Walter-ize this thing.

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:01.961
Well, in that case...

01:20:01.995 --> 01:20:03.998
we're gonna need a bigger flock.

01:20:04.031 --> 01:20:05.633
You're calling Marcy,
aren't you?

01:20:05.666 --> 01:20:06.901
Yep.

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:08.135
Tell her I said hi.

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:17.828
Let's get weird.

01:20:17.829 --> 01:20:19.045
Boom.

01:20:32.226 --> 01:20:35.062
Nowhere to run
from this, Lance.

01:20:35.095 --> 01:20:39.164
Listen,
I'm sorry about what happened in Kyrgyzstan.

01:20:39.199 --> 01:20:43.036
But we are stuck in this
good guy-bad guy vortex.

01:20:43.069 --> 01:20:46.307
We do not have
to do it like this.

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:48.775
Yeah, bit late for that.

01:20:48.809 --> 01:20:50.010
It's not.

01:20:50.043 --> 01:20:52.212
We're both just people
who make mistakes.

01:20:52.245 --> 01:20:54.348
- We can work this out, man.
- That's it.

01:20:54.381 --> 01:20:56.784
<i> Almost there.
You're doing great.</i>

01:20:56.817 --> 01:20:58.652
I mean, come on.

01:20:58.685 --> 01:21:00.888
We can break this cycle.

01:21:00.921 --> 01:21:02.521
Got it. I'm connected.

01:21:02.556 --> 01:21:04.258
Nobody else has to get hurt.

01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:08.028
You should know
better than anyone.

01:21:11.565 --> 01:21:14.234
Someone always gets hurt.

01:21:14.267 --> 01:21:15.336
Not today-day.

01:21:20.074 --> 01:21:22.475
You brought your own soundtrack?

01:21:22.509 --> 01:21:24.478
We like to make an entrance.

01:21:27.414 --> 01:21:28.515
Huh?

01:21:28.549 --> 01:21:29.817
Oh.

01:21:52.006 --> 01:21:53.073
Huh?

01:21:54.741 --> 01:21:56.610
Would you look at that?

01:21:56.644 --> 01:21:57.753
There's a man with a robot hand

01:21:57.777 --> 01:21:58.878
wearing your face...

01:21:58.912 --> 01:22:01.048
who took the M9 Assassin.

01:22:01.081 --> 01:22:02.815
Guess I owe you an apology.

01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:04.184
Okay. Go ahead.

01:22:04.218 --> 01:22:06.720
No, that was it.
That was the apology.

01:22:06.754 --> 01:22:08.388
Oh. I accept.

01:22:12.993 --> 01:22:15.529
But you gotta admit,
it was a little Scooby-Doo.

01:22:15.562 --> 01:22:17.497
Oh, 100% Scooby-Doo.

01:22:17.531 --> 01:22:20.100
I'm gonna make this hurt!

01:22:26.873 --> 01:22:28.442
Okay, come on through.

01:22:28.475 --> 01:22:30.320
You are safe here. Come on.

01:22:30.344 --> 01:22:31.645
Is that everyone?

01:22:31.678 --> 01:22:34.548
Director, we've got
unknown incoming.

01:22:34.581 --> 01:22:35.615
Approaching fast.

01:22:36.684 --> 01:22:38.586
Oh, this is bad.

01:22:48.062 --> 01:22:49.330
Lock this place down.

01:23:06.046 --> 01:23:07.948
We're sitting ducks.

01:23:08.782 --> 01:23:10.115
Walter hacked his hand.

01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:12.094
We gotta buy him
some time to shut down the drones.

01:23:12.118 --> 01:23:14.221
Got it. What kind of
firepower we talking?

01:23:17.791 --> 01:23:19.159
Just go along with it.

01:23:20.527 --> 01:23:21.595
Take your best shot.

01:23:21.628 --> 01:23:23.796
This one sucks.

01:23:26.266 --> 01:23:27.968
<i> No, no, no,
that's binder bubbles.</i>

01:23:28.001 --> 01:23:29.802
<i>Push the button on the back.</i>

01:23:29.836 --> 01:23:32.006
Button on the back,
button on the back!

01:23:38.344 --> 01:23:39.246
Bubbles?

01:23:39.279 --> 01:23:41.581
Oh, you gotta let me try that.

01:23:41.614 --> 01:23:43.684
<i>That's
a collide-oscope. Throw it.</i>

01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:59.466
Splat-a-pult. Prism spray.
Hypno-stars.

01:23:59.499 --> 01:24:01.868
Snorepedo. Scream Team.

01:24:01.901 --> 01:24:04.338
Well, what have we got to lose?

01:24:06.906 --> 01:24:08.342
11 o'clock.

01:24:08.375 --> 01:24:11.445
12 o'clock.
Half past 2! 4:30!

01:24:12.546 --> 01:24:13.614
<i> Security blanket.</i>

01:24:14.714 --> 01:24:17.250
<i> It's upside down.</i>

01:24:17.283 --> 01:24:18.818
<i>I'm a hugger.</i>

01:24:18.852 --> 01:24:20.220
Whoa.

01:24:26.693 --> 01:24:27.726
Nice shot.

01:24:31.798 --> 01:24:33.367
Thank you?

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.335
Walter, gonna need
a reload, buddy.

01:24:35.368 --> 01:24:37.604
<i>Ask and you shall receive.</i>

01:24:37.637 --> 01:24:39.673
Are those pigeons
wearing tiny backpacks?

01:24:40.507 --> 01:24:42.042
<i> Yay!</i>

01:24:42.075 --> 01:24:44.244
Now, that's hot.
That's hot.

01:24:45.345 --> 01:24:47.681
I call it Fifty Shades of Yay!

01:24:47.714 --> 01:24:49.816
Oh, come on, now!

01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:51.351
You ready
to tap out yet?

01:25:09.536 --> 01:25:10.570
Gadget lab.

01:25:10.604 --> 01:25:14.307
Get to the gadget lab!
Grab every weapon you can!

01:25:15.075 --> 01:25:17.177
Stop! Get back!

01:25:18.945 --> 01:25:20.681
Oh, no.

01:25:27.054 --> 01:25:29.055
<i> Yay!</i>

01:25:29.088 --> 01:25:30.408
<i>I'm a hugger.</i>

01:25:35.529 --> 01:25:38.632
Walter, my face
can't take much more of this.

01:25:38.665 --> 01:25:40.276
You keep doing your thing
and I'll do mine.

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:41.343
Yeah, well, your thing
seems to be

01:25:41.367 --> 01:25:42.735
a lot easier than my thing.

01:25:42.769 --> 01:25:44.137
We have different skillsets.

01:25:44.171 --> 01:25:45.615
That's what makes us
such a great team.

01:25:45.639 --> 01:25:46.640
Dude.

01:26:05.859 --> 01:26:07.427
- Excuse me.
- Ugh.

01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.263
Whoo.
Why do I smell lavender?

01:26:09.296 --> 01:26:10.829
We just got spritzed.

01:26:10.864 --> 01:26:12.199
Uh-oh. Truth serum.

01:26:12.232 --> 01:26:13.466
I have five cats,

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.910
each named after a member
of New Kids on the Block.

01:26:14.934 --> 01:26:16.034
Oh, I love New Kids.

01:26:16.069 --> 01:26:17.346
Jon, Joey, Jordan,
Donnie, and Danny.

01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:19.506
I really wanna
hurt you right now.

01:26:24.578 --> 01:26:25.477
You.

01:26:25.512 --> 01:26:27.781
What...
What are you doing?

01:26:27.814 --> 01:26:29.048
I'm not telling you anything.

01:26:29.082 --> 01:26:30.126
I'll tell you what he's doing.

01:26:30.150 --> 01:26:31.193
He's gonna hack into your claw

01:26:31.217 --> 01:26:32.419
and shut down your drones.

01:26:32.452 --> 01:26:34.487
Wow, this stuff really works.

01:26:41.995 --> 01:26:43.197
No, no, no.

01:26:46.033 --> 01:26:47.901
No!

01:26:54.441 --> 01:26:56.410
- Whoa!
- I'm coming, Walter.

01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:07.621
Almost there. Don't let go.
Please don't let go.

01:27:17.431 --> 01:27:18.731
Walter!

01:27:24.103 --> 01:27:25.339
Walter.

01:27:35.782 --> 01:27:37.217
Come on, come on.

01:27:41.922 --> 01:27:43.690
Somebody do something.

01:27:53.433 --> 01:27:56.870
If you shut 'em down now,
you'll kill us both.

01:28:01.007 --> 01:28:02.910
And you're no killer.

01:28:06.713 --> 01:28:09.116
No. I'm a hugger.

01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:10.417
What?

01:28:15.054 --> 01:28:20.561
<i> One day, your gadgets
are gonna keep the world safe.</i>

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:44.784
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:28:44.818 --> 01:28:46.686
Never wash that hand again!

01:29:01.301 --> 01:29:03.403
I got you, Walter!

01:29:03.437 --> 01:29:04.622
Lance? What are you...

01:29:08.274 --> 01:29:09.809
It's okay.

01:29:09.843 --> 01:29:11.378
It's okay.

01:29:11.911 --> 01:29:13.647
You can't do this alone.

01:29:14.815 --> 01:29:16.283
I am not alone!

01:29:17.917 --> 01:29:19.653
Lovey?

01:29:21.821 --> 01:29:23.257
Come on, birds!

01:29:25.592 --> 01:29:26.860
Fly!

01:29:51.851 --> 01:29:53.053
Walter.

01:29:53.553 --> 01:29:55.355
Walter.

01:29:57.757 --> 01:30:00.593
What does internal bleeding feel like?

01:30:00.627 --> 01:30:03.129
This.
It feels like this.

01:30:03.163 --> 01:30:04.264
Oh, come here.

01:30:04.297 --> 01:30:05.766
No, no, no. No hugs.

01:30:05.799 --> 01:30:06.666
You gonna make me

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.968
lay an egg or something
in front of Marcy.

01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:15.941
Huh?

01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:23.449
He saved him.

01:30:26.218 --> 01:30:29.156
I think I need a vet.

01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:32.124
Once I can move again,
I'll turn you back into a man.

01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:33.660
Sterling.

01:30:33.694 --> 01:30:35.061
You're a bird?

01:30:35.095 --> 01:30:36.596
Uh, hey, Marcy.

01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:38.931
That's why I couldn't find you!

01:30:41.868 --> 01:30:44.370
Whoa, you're a bird.
That is messed up.

01:30:44.403 --> 01:30:45.704
It's weird, right?

01:30:45.739 --> 01:30:46.839
This is amazing.

01:30:46.872 --> 01:30:47.773
We did it.

01:30:47.807 --> 01:30:50.377
We took down the drones,
beat the bad guy,

01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:51.778
saved countless lives.

01:30:51.811 --> 01:30:54.381
We are so gonna get
our jobs back!

01:30:56.816 --> 01:30:58.718
So, triple fired.

01:30:58.752 --> 01:31:01.788
Yeah, man, that's gotta
be some kind of record.

01:31:01.822 --> 01:31:03.722
I really didn't see that coming.

01:31:03.756 --> 01:31:07.760
Well, we did break
a bunch of laws, and defied orders...

01:31:07.793 --> 01:31:10.230
and, I mean, committed
a little bit of treason.

01:31:10.263 --> 01:31:11.965
Oh, right, yeah, the treason.

01:31:11.998 --> 01:31:13.667
Forgot about the treason.

01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:16.769
Hey.
It doesn't matter, man.

01:31:16.803 --> 01:31:18.037
Look around.

01:31:19.972 --> 01:31:23.410
Your mother would be
so proud of you right now.

01:31:25.277 --> 01:31:27.714
You kept all those people safe.

01:31:29.349 --> 01:31:31.650
And you did it your way.

01:31:32.619 --> 01:31:35.288
But you also did this.

01:31:35.321 --> 01:31:36.789
Yeah.

01:31:36.823 --> 01:31:39.624
I'll figure that out.
Sorry.

01:31:39.659 --> 01:31:41.460
You know, this gluten-free stuff

01:31:41.494 --> 01:31:43.096
is really starting
to grow on me.

01:31:45.598 --> 01:31:47.233
So, what do we do now?

01:31:47.266 --> 01:31:48.368
Oh, we could...

01:31:52.839 --> 01:31:54.640
Huh?

01:31:54.674 --> 01:31:55.675
Marcy?

01:31:55.708 --> 01:31:57.777
Okay,
I can't see or hear...

01:31:57.810 --> 01:32:02.015
but my other senses
are elevated, so you... Ow!

01:32:02.048 --> 01:32:05.318
<i>Agent Sterling,
I apologize for the theatrics.</i>

01:32:05.352 --> 01:32:06.586
No, you don't.

01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:08.330
You should have seen your face
when we grabbed you.

01:32:08.354 --> 01:32:09.755
I didn't make a face.

01:32:09.789 --> 01:32:11.224
No one's ever looked
more scared.

01:32:11.257 --> 01:32:12.358
<i>Are you two finished?</i>

01:32:12.392 --> 01:32:13.960
We are gonna
be okay, Lance!

01:32:13.993 --> 01:32:16.496
Use your baby hand
to pick the lock!

01:32:16.529 --> 01:32:19.199
<i>Can you please
take that off him?</i>

01:32:19.232 --> 01:32:21.367
Okay, and you can...

01:32:21.401 --> 01:32:23.769
Oh, hey. Hey, guys.

01:32:23.803 --> 01:32:26.473
Is this about the treason?

01:32:26.506 --> 01:32:28.474
Joy, what is going on?

01:32:28.508 --> 01:32:30.743
<i>We realize
we were wrong about you.</i>

01:32:30.777 --> 01:32:32.879
<i>You're the future
of this agency,</i>

01:32:32.912 --> 01:32:34.614
<i>and we want you
to lead a new team.</i>

01:32:34.647 --> 01:32:36.783
<i>A highly covert global...</i>

01:32:36.816 --> 01:32:38.618
Let me stop you
right there.

01:32:38.651 --> 01:32:40.453
I'm not leading nothing,

01:32:40.486 --> 01:32:43.055
unless my man
Walter's on the team.

01:32:43.089 --> 01:32:44.290
Um...

01:32:44.324 --> 01:32:46.626
I think she's talking to Walter.

01:32:46.659 --> 01:32:48.044
Oh. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, we...

01:32:48.045 --> 01:32:49.429
Just put that down.

01:32:49.462 --> 01:32:50.505
Sometimes, he talks for me,

01:32:50.529 --> 01:32:51.873
I'll talk for him,
'cause we a team.

01:32:51.897 --> 01:32:52.999
Me?

01:32:53.033 --> 01:32:55.167
<i>We need people like you.</i>

01:32:55.201 --> 01:32:59.239
<i>People who can
help the Agency do things a new way.</i>

01:32:59.906 --> 01:33:01.107
<i>What do you say?</i>

01:33:02.575 --> 01:33:04.811
Looks like we gonna
need some glitter.

01:33:05.878 --> 01:33:06.779
Team Weird?

01:33:06.812 --> 01:33:08.114
Team Weird.

01:33:11.084 --> 01:33:13.119
<i>Missile deactivated.</i>
