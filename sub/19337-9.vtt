<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
MARY:
<i>The privateer Martin de Lambert</i>

00:04.205 --> 00:06.205
<i> is here. </i>
GREER:<i> You are a scoundrel,</i>

00:06.207 --> 00:08.374
a rogue.
Pirate.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.742
Your mother spoke of you
so often.

00:09.744 --> 00:11.276
Your courage,
your beauty.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.411
I felt like I knew you

00:12.413 --> 00:13.512
before you'd even arrived.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.747
I promised her
I'd watch over you.

00:14.749 --> 00:16.448
You're my Loyal Watchman.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.950
<i> Over the coming week,</i>

00:17.951 --> 00:19.451
guests will be arriving
from across the continent

00:19.453 --> 00:21.353
to witness our
Catholic wedding.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.588
I have a message for you

00:22.590 --> 00:24.123
before you wed.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.424
You will have love...

00:25.426 --> 00:27.526
or an heir, but not both.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.228
Don't bother
trying to deny

00:29.230 --> 00:30.195
you're having an affair.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.663
I will marry Darnley,

00:31.665 --> 00:33.599
but if this gets out,
I will be the woman

00:33.601 --> 00:36.402
who couldn't keep her husband
close on the eve of her wedding.

00:36.404 --> 00:37.703
<i> I want Keira gone.</i>

00:37.705 --> 00:39.505
(horse neighs, Keira grunts)

00:39.507 --> 00:41.306
DARNLEY:
<i> Every time I look at you,</i>
<i> I will see</i>

00:41.308 --> 00:42.474
the person who killed...

00:42.476 --> 00:43.709
The woman you truly love.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.644
Catherine!
Please, help me get

00:45.646 --> 00:47.446
out of this marriage.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.388
Well, I must say that all
the parties for your wedding

00:56.390 --> 00:59.324
have drawn the most
supportive crowds.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.826
Let's hope my subjects
are as supportive

01:00.828 --> 01:02.594
if I choose to call
my wedding off.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.431
Well, the blame will fall
squarely on Darnley.

01:05.433 --> 01:09.435
You just say the word and
the rumor mill will be ignited.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.236
Strategic whispers

01:11.238 --> 01:12.704
of Darnley's affairs.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.239
But Keira was
the only one.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.541
Well, not when
I'm done with him.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.709
One must embellish,
but trust me,

01:17.711 --> 01:19.478
we'll adjust as necessary.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.481
If you discard him,
Darnley will be left

01:22.483 --> 01:25.150
in a dark cloud of shame.

01:25.152 --> 01:26.418
Here we are.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.253
So good to let the
people see their queen.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.423
(indistinct conversation)

01:31.425 --> 01:33.325
And what of those who are
not privy to such gossip?

01:33.327 --> 01:35.594
The nobles and dignitaries
who are coming from points

01:35.596 --> 01:37.329
around the world
to see me wed

01:37.331 --> 01:38.664
in two days' time.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.466
How shall we smooth things
over with them?

01:40.468 --> 01:42.468
That is trickier
than I thought.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.769
What if we pacify them

01:43.771 --> 01:45.537
with a parting gift?

01:45.539 --> 01:46.472
Never heard of
such a thing.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.107
I just invented it.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.143
Give them gold, jewels,

01:51.145 --> 01:52.778
anything that you have.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.613
MARY:
I'm afraid our coffers
are quite dry.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.483
Money won't be
the only hurdle you'll face.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.851
If you cancel the wedding now,

01:58.853 --> 02:00.619
the Vatican will be
quite displeased.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.454
They have gold
enough of their own

02:02.456 --> 02:03.755
and they don't care who
Darnley sleeps with.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.757
They want you wed
to the man

02:05.759 --> 02:07.359
who will help you
take England.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.761
They've sent their
most powerful emissary,

02:09.763 --> 02:11.530
Cardinal Adomo, to attend.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.265
We will find solutions

02:13.267 --> 02:14.399
if abandoning
this wedding

02:14.401 --> 02:16.502
is what you feel
you still must do.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.738
Hold off... for now.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.540
There's one last detail
I need to attend to

02:21.542 --> 02:22.407
before we move forward.

02:22.409 --> 02:23.709
And be vigilant

02:23.711 --> 02:25.544
in your spying

02:25.546 --> 02:26.845
of John Knox.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.247
Elizabeth isn't the only one

02:28.249 --> 02:29.448
who opposes this marriage.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.550
I need to know where
all of my enemies stand

02:31.552 --> 02:33.452
and what moves
they plan to make

02:33.454 --> 02:34.820

a time-honored tradition

02:52.339 --> 02:53.605
to show his worthiness.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.607
To the future king of Scotland.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.708
(crowd cheers)

03:03.684 --> 03:04.950

actually speak

but we need to...

time right now.

Well, you got what you wanted.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.232
I'm marrying a queen.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.667

If that weren't
bad enough,

She's not your child, not
according to the world.

I told you, the story is that
my husband and I adopted her.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.674
She is my daughter.

05:08.676 --> 05:12.411
And more important to me
than your foolish shame.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.346
It's her shame I'm
worried about, not mine.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.616
Do you want her to grow up
an outcast, illegitimate?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.618
The lie gives her a chance
at a good life, a marriage.

they can leave this castle,

09:11.852 --> 09:12.951
they can leave this country.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.152
I'm sure Queen Mary
would agree.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.754
We won't allow you or Rose

09:15.756 --> 09:16.888
to suffer any slight.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.856
That's very kind,

09:17.858 --> 09:19.558
but I don't want
to cause a stir.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.126
I'm very protective of Rose,
and more at ease

09:21.128 --> 09:22.794
keeping her by my side,
just until things

09:22.796 --> 09:23.995
at the castle return to normal.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.830
Well, it's settled, then.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.966
You'll bring Rose to the
knotting game tomorrow,

09:27.968 --> 09:29.834
and the three of us
will have a grand time.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.736
The three of us?
Indeed.

09:31.738 --> 09:32.971
Children adore me.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.941
I won't take no
for an answer.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.077
ELIZABETH:
<i> Bishop takes pawn.</i>

09:39.079 --> 09:40.679
You're hanging
your bishop.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.582
(sighs)
Elizabeth, you... you don't have

09:43.584 --> 09:45.917
to throw the match
to make me feel better.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.620
I am doing no such thing.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.790
We don't have time
for games right now.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.159
There are far more immediate
concerns for you and I

09:54.161 --> 09:55.994
to discuss.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.897
The impending marriage
of the queen of Scots for one.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.700
I mean, every world leader
from around the globe

10:01.702 --> 10:04.636
is attending the royal wedding
in some capacity.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.739
With the queen of Scots wed
to Lord Darnley

10:07.741 --> 10:10.008
and my position
more tenuous than ever,

10:10.010 --> 10:13.378
what's to prevent them from
joining forces and invading?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.913
What will happen to me?

10:14.915 --> 10:17.115
I will protect you

10:17.117 --> 10:19.017
from forces like Spain.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.353
I will not allow my queen
<i> and</i> my friend

10:21.355 --> 10:22.787
to be undone.

Reverend Knox has been spotted
heading for the home

11:07.034 --> 11:08.767
of Widow Jameson.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.368
Appears he plans to attend
her husband's wake.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.240
I told you,
I had my men tailing him.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.708
I'll leave, we've time.

11:16.710 --> 11:17.909
I don't.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.044
I'm supposed to be at that wake.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.845
If my husband
doesn't find me there,

11:20.847 --> 11:22.914
he'll question my whereabouts.
Go now.

11:22.916 --> 11:23.982
Once you're at a safe distance,

11:23.984 --> 11:25.717
I'll slip out the back to avoid

11:25.719 --> 11:26.751
being seen by anyone.

11:30.891 --> 11:31.990
(door closes)

11:38.965 --> 11:40.198
Did you find what you came for?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.866
I'm afraid Knox's plans

11:41.868 --> 11:43.201
are even deadlier
than I thought.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.703
He's been corresponding

11:44.705 --> 11:46.171
with Lady Keira's widower.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.106
Informing Lord White
that his late wife

11:48.108 --> 11:50.341
was having an affair
with Lord Darnley.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.810
Knox advised White

11:51.812 --> 11:53.244
on the perfect opportunity

11:53.246 --> 11:55.080
to avenge his wife's honor.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.448
A secret meeting tomorrow.

11:56.450 --> 11:58.083
Meaning Darnley
will be unprotected

11:58.085 --> 11:59.784
and away from the castle.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.720
Information likely gained
from Knox's spies.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.988
Lord White is en route
to Scotland

12:03.990 --> 12:07.092
to murder the future king
before Mary can wed him.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.361
Our best hope is to try
and stop him at the water.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.263
(both grunt)

12:12.265 --> 12:15.133
Unless we're already too late.
(grunts)

12:20.373 --> 12:22.307
RIZZIO (laughs):
The next thing I know,

12:22.309 --> 12:25.009
I'm begging a seven-year-old
duke to spare my life.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.244
(laughter)

12:26.246 --> 12:27.912
Never embark on
a business venture

12:27.914 --> 12:30.048
with a partner
who's yet to be weaned, eh?

12:30.050 --> 12:33.151
(laughter)
Shouldn't the knotting game
have been begun already?

12:33.153 --> 12:35.153
I'll see what's holding us up.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.388
This party is
for Darnley, too.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.190
I can't believe he won't show.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.925
You said he's gone hunting?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.094
Yes, and he's slipped
his guards.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.796
Guards for his protection?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.431
Or to keep an eye on him?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.100
He lies, cheats,
he grasps for power.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.069
What better time to do that
than when leaders from

12:51.071 --> 12:52.303
around the world
are gathered here?

12:52.305 --> 12:54.405
He also drinks excessively.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.307
So, yes, I keep an eye on him,

12:56.309 --> 13:00.178
and, to be honest,
he could be... anywhere.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.380
And James,
has he returned from...

13:02.382 --> 13:04.516
his sojourn with Lady Knox?

13:04.518 --> 13:07.218
No, it is odd.
With both Darnley

13:07.220 --> 13:08.486
and my brother missing,
I can't help but fear

13:08.488 --> 13:10.321
there's some plot afoot.
(clears throat)

13:10.323 --> 13:13.191
Someone is here
to speak with you.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.559
Oh.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.162
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Your Majesty.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.463
Mary, please.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.898
I told you,
I don't let my friends

13:19.900 --> 13:21.199
stand on ceremony.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.134
Ah, Catherine de Medici,

13:23.136 --> 13:24.536
David Rizzio.

13:24.538 --> 13:26.004
Oh, my.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.038
What an honor.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.072
You are

13:28.074 --> 13:29.474
revered at home.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.911
Mary has told me many
wonderful things about you.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.179
You're too kind.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.047
I'm not, truly.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.116
(chuckles)

13:38.118 --> 13:39.484
Mary,

13:39.486 --> 13:42.020
the guests are beginning
to get a little restless.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.188
If I'm right to suspect
that Lord Darnley's absence

13:43.190 --> 13:44.422
is the cause for delay,

13:44.424 --> 13:46.224
might I suggest

13:46.226 --> 13:47.892
beginning the game without him.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.127
You don't think he'll be missed?

13:49.129 --> 13:50.562
No one gives a damn
about the groom.

13:50.564 --> 13:53.331
MARY:
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

13:53.333 --> 13:56.100
the rules of the knotting game
are simple.

13:56.102 --> 13:59.037
Follow your chosen thread
through to its end.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.039
Your journey will
not be obvious.

14:01.041 --> 14:04.209
Fate's twists and turns
may surprise you.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.077
But those who prevail

14:06.079 --> 14:09.280
will find their fortune
in a sweet reward.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.882
Enjoy the game.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.237
No one has seen Darnley
since this morning.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.273
What if Lord White has already
done him harm?

15:08.275 --> 15:09.908
White never made it
into Scotland.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.242
I stopped him at
one of the border crossings

15:11.244 --> 15:12.243
just before dawn.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.978
Your marriage to Darnley,

15:13.980 --> 15:16.381
if you still want it,
is safe from Knox.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.616
And what about this
secret meeting in the letter

15:18.618 --> 15:20.184
that Darnley
was supposed to attend?

15:20.186 --> 15:21.319
Lord White knew little.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.021
We saved your fiancé's life,

15:23.023 --> 15:24.455
but there's no telling
where Darnley is right now

15:24.457 --> 15:26.257
or what he's up to.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.592
I think I know who can.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.228
(laughter)

15:30.230 --> 15:32.030
Darnley's mother.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.232
She's cunning, Mary;
you'll get little from her.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.234
But I know who will.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.276
JAMES: Now it's
my turn to apologize.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.312
I promised I would
help you with Rose,

15:47.314 --> 15:49.314
and I'm sorry I was detained.

15:49.316 --> 15:52.116
Don't worry yourself;
we've had loads of fun watching.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.418
Well, it's even more fun
to play.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.653
Here, I got us a string.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.322
But the game's almost finished.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.691
Then we should stop wasting time
and get to it.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.367
I don't believe that we've met.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.202
Lady Lennox, isn't it?

16:11.204 --> 16:13.137
And you're Catherine de Medici.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.140
Well, I'm so glad to finally
make your acquaintance.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.710
After all, we have
much in common.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.579
Both mothers of kings,
soon enough.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.382
I meant great affection
for Mary, Queen of Scots.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.384
Though, as to our
sons, I suppose

16:26.386 --> 16:28.419
king consort is

16:28.421 --> 16:30.054
a kind of king.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.688
I hear the same
about young Charles,

16:31.691 --> 16:34.459
a "special" kind
of king.

16:34.461 --> 16:35.760
Lover of nature, they say.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.730
Something about
nocturnal outings

16:38.732 --> 16:40.932
and, uh, missing children.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.133
I've learned not to put
much stock in what "they" say.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.403
Just today, I heard
that your son,

16:45.405 --> 16:47.438
well, he's been greeted
with skepticism

16:47.440 --> 16:49.307
from the established
royal families.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.576
It's a shame so
few are willing

16:51.578 --> 16:55.013
to accept a royal... upstart.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.382
I do hope that Lord Darnley
is receiving the proper

16:57.384 --> 16:58.716
level of respect.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.251
Welcomed with open arms.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.419
And my dear

17:01.421 --> 17:04.655
daughter, Leeza,
she's the queen of Spain,

17:04.657 --> 17:06.524
hopes you don't take
her lack of attendance

17:06.526 --> 17:07.792
as a slight.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.428
She sent a full dining set
of pure gold

17:10.430 --> 17:11.796
with her personal apologies.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.498
The gifts are always
so telling, aren't they?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.333
Francis and Mary
received

17:15.335 --> 17:18.269
50 white stallions from
the Portuguese royal family.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.071
Nearly a hundred just arrived.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.407
And King Sigmund of Poland,
he couldn't make it?

17:22.409 --> 17:24.042
He sent the crown prince
in his stead.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.244
The archduke of Lithuania?
He's here.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.345
And the Vatican?
Have they welcomed your son?

17:27.347 --> 17:29.480
Well, the...

17:29.482 --> 17:32.316
I hear that Adomo hasn't been
seen since this morning.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.052
Much like Lord Darnley.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.386
Perhaps they ran
into each other.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.256
Together, as we speak.

17:38.258 --> 17:41.659
I, uh, don't believe, um...

17:41.661 --> 17:43.227
There's no accounting for

17:43.229 --> 17:44.495
coincidence of course,
but, uh...

17:44.497 --> 17:45.663
Uh...

17:45.665 --> 17:47.231
(chuckles)

17:47.233 --> 17:49.500
I really should
get back to the game.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.501
Again,

17:50.503 --> 17:52.470
it's lovely to meet you.

18:03.216 --> 18:06.117
Darnley is meeting behind
your back with the Vatican--

18:06.119 --> 18:07.452
Cardinal Adomo,
to be precise.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.321
Where is yet to
be discerned.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.423
You left your cake,
Queen Mary.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.426
I, uh... I'm
terribly sorry.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.862
I couldn't help but overhear
your exchange.

18:19.833 --> 18:23.734
I can find out where Darnley
is meeting with Adomo.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.171
How?

18:27.173 --> 18:28.206
CATHERINE:
Are you...

18:28.208 --> 18:30.641
close with the cardinal?

18:30.643 --> 18:33.411
Perhaps someone
in the cardinal's retinue?

18:33.413 --> 18:34.479
You're good.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.513
I never judge.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.848
Who are you sleeping with?

18:36.850 --> 18:39.383
Adomo's secretary,
Father Julian.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.219
He handles all the
cardinal's correspondence.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.887
I have a key
to his chamber.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.490
I can find any correspondence
he's had about the meeting.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.425
Good.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.897
David.

18:54.801 --> 18:58.870
What you propose to do
is very dangerous.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.741
There's so much
that I don't understand

19:03.743 --> 19:05.710
about how I ended up here.

19:05.712 --> 19:09.180
But I know that I am meant to
help you, Mary, Queen of Scots.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.182
Perhaps it's
your friend Sebastian's

19:11.184 --> 19:12.917
fearless devotion
coming through.

19:12.919 --> 19:16.487
All I know
is that I am blessed...

19:16.489 --> 19:17.788
(sighs)

19:17.790 --> 19:19.423
...to have the loyalty

19:19.425 --> 19:20.858
you have placed in me.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.497
(bagpipe music playing)

19:31.271 --> 19:33.471
What are you doing?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.540
I'm watching the game.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.275
No, you're watching Lady Greer.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.277
And I saw you speaking
with her earlier, as well.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.913
Your conversation
seemed to upset her.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.598
Why is that?

19:43.599 --> 19:45.282
She was more startled
than upset.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.684
We met in France.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.452
You met before?

19:48.454 --> 19:50.655
My appearance here
was a bit of a shock.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.524
But I assure you,
I mean no harm to Greer,

19:53.526 --> 19:56.227
or your relationship with her.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.962
Greer and I?

19:57.964 --> 19:59.630
No. We-we are not...

19:59.632 --> 20:00.831
My mistake.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.733
If you'll excuse me.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.703
Wait.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.540
You're Rose's father.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.344
Please...

20:13.346 --> 20:15.313
you mustn't tell anyone.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.815
That's why Greer
was so upset to see me here.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.518
Worried someone might find out,
and Rose would be called a...

20:20.520 --> 20:21.586
A bastard?

20:21.588 --> 20:22.820
Don't worry.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.488
Heard it too many times
to be offended.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.524
You're the queen's half-brother.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.558
I am.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.961
James, Earl of Moray.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.796
All right, then, James.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.331
I've got a deal for you.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.299
If you'll help me with Greer.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.671
We must discuss
your wife-to-be.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.573
Ah.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.409
Mary is in
an unnatural position.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.378
Women are not
suited to rule.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.847
It distorts
their feminine virtues.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.649
Hardens their temperaments.

20:51.651 --> 20:55.653
Makes them unaccommodating
and caustic.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.521
Difficulties kings
do not possess.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.557
Which is why I was delighted
to meet with you alone.

20:59.559 --> 21:00.725
I'm a friend of the Church

21:00.727 --> 21:02.393
who would like
to be a better friend.

21:02.395 --> 21:05.463
Unfortunately,
my powers are limited.

21:05.465 --> 21:08.666
Mary has denied me
the Crown Matrimonial.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.935
Mary's power is not
in her crown.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.604
It's in the loyalty
of the Scottish nobles.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.807
The Vatican is prepared
to give you control

21:16.809 --> 21:18.509
of its purse strings
in Scotland,

21:18.511 --> 21:20.678
allowing you to grow your power

21:20.680 --> 21:22.513
and popularity.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.982
You would funnel Vatican funds
through me?

21:24.984 --> 21:27.585
In time, your dear wife
will bow to you,

21:27.587 --> 21:29.654
Crown Matrimonial
or not.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.658
What is the meaning of this?

21:36.496 --> 21:38.996
There is a carriage waiting
to take you back to the castle.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.032
You can leave this room
on your feet,

21:41.034 --> 21:42.533
or by force.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.568
Choose.

21:48.041 --> 21:50.007
With outbursts
like this,

21:50.009 --> 21:52.810
you risk losing
the Vatican's support.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.045
Is that what this is?

21:54.047 --> 21:55.646
Support?

21:55.648 --> 21:58.082
Because any discussions

21:58.083 --> 22:00.517
on how the Church
can best support my rule

22:00.520 --> 22:02.553
should include me,

22:02.555 --> 22:04.555
if you have business
with my throne.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.791
There will be repercussions.

22:06.793 --> 22:11.495
Be that as it may,
Scotland has one true ruler:

22:11.497 --> 22:13.664
Mary, Queen of Scots,

22:13.666 --> 22:16.434
daughter of James V,

22:16.436 --> 22:19.637
crowned on her sixth day
and appointed not by the Pope,

22:19.639 --> 22:21.939
but the Almighty Himself.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.341
It is my duty,

22:23.343 --> 22:26.110
my God-given birthright
and my crown.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.745
And I will defend it

22:27.747 --> 22:30.848
from anyone
who attempts to take it.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.490
I just saw Darnley
return to court

22:39.492 --> 22:42.026
with a substantial escort
and a sullen expression.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.895
I assume that means
you were successful

22:44.897 --> 22:46.897
in quashing his duplicity

22:46.899 --> 22:48.432
with the piety peddlers.

22:48.434 --> 22:51.068
But you don't seem
very happy about that.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.571
No. It's the Vatican.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.539
Cardinal Adomo said
there would be

22:55.541 --> 22:58.376
repercussions for
my interference.

22:58.378 --> 23:01.145
I received this almost
as soon as I arrived back.

23:01.147 --> 23:04.081
The Vatican will not be helping
sway the border towns,

23:04.083 --> 23:05.950
which we need in order
to take England.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.618
Cardinal Adomo

23:07.620 --> 23:10.588
didn't call it
outright retaliation, but...

23:10.590 --> 23:12.523
No.

23:12.524 --> 23:14.457
Adomo knows
not to implicate the Church

23:14.460 --> 23:15.659
in undermining a rightful

23:15.661 --> 23:17.094
Catholic monarch.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.797
I know those towns
are key

23:19.799 --> 23:21.932
to your ambition
for the English throne.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.702
There are other ways
to win them over.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.972
Martin?

23:27.974 --> 23:30.007
I don't know who you mean.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.675
(sighs)

23:31.677 --> 23:33.744
I know he's Rose's father.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.915
And I realize that this
is none of my business,

23:37.917 --> 23:40.651
but I think
you should consider

23:40.653 --> 23:42.586
letting him spend
time with her.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.955
Unbelievable. Did he ask you
to speak with me on the topic?

23:44.957 --> 23:49.126
He did. He swore he wouldn't
tell a soul who he is to you

23:49.128 --> 23:51.662
if you'd consider allowing him
into Rose's life.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.531
I knew it.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.766
You can't trust a pirate
to keep a secret for one day.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.735
And now he's blackmailing me.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.970
I don't think his
threat was serious.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.706
In fact, he tried quite hard
to keep your secret.

24:02.708 --> 24:06.877
Greer, might you look at
his arrival, his desire,

24:06.879 --> 24:10.047
as an opportunity to allow
Rose to share in his love?

24:10.049 --> 24:11.749
He's clearly
smitten with her.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.551
He wants to be
a father.

24:13.553 --> 24:15.853
He wants to help
in any way he can.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.855
In fact, he offered to watch her
during Mary's wedding

24:17.857 --> 24:19.657
so that you can come
to the reception banquet.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.592
Rose's future

24:21.594 --> 24:23.794
is tenuous enough because of
the color of her skin.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.464
I can't hide that,

24:26.466 --> 24:28.032
but I will do everything
in my power

24:28.034 --> 24:29.967
to ensure that no one finds out
she was born out of wedlock,

24:29.969 --> 24:33.037
just because
my encounter with Martin

24:33.039 --> 24:34.905
was born out of weakness.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.140
Loneliness.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.741
Oh, it was selfish

24:37.743 --> 24:41.479
and stupid, and I won't let Rose
pay for my mistakes.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.214
Allowing Martin
into Rose's life

24:43.216 --> 24:44.582
only invites
complications.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.050
What happens when
Rose is old enough

24:46.052 --> 24:48.085
to wonder why
Martin comes around?

24:48.087 --> 24:50.721
I can't ask a child
to keep that sort of secret.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.656
Only you can decide
what's best for Rose.

24:52.658 --> 24:56.660
But you don't have to make those
kinds of decisions right now.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.762
Start with one night.

24:58.764 --> 25:00.264
One party.

25:00.266 --> 25:03.767
And don't let shame about
your past cloud your future.

25:03.769 --> 25:06.737
We all have things we're
ashamed of, believe me.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.806
But sometimes, great things
come from our mistakes.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.708
Rose is one of them.

25:10.710 --> 25:14.678
And while her parentage
may be complicated,

25:14.680 --> 25:17.982
it could also make your lives
richer in unexpected ways.

25:20.786 --> 25:23.153
KNOX:
<i>Sounds like your Bible students</i>
<i> are all progressing nicely.</i>

25:23.155 --> 25:24.722
Indeed they are.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.190
And what of Lord Moray?

25:26.192 --> 25:27.858
Aren't you guiding his

25:27.860 --> 25:30.661
study of the Holy Scriptures
as well?

25:31.764 --> 25:33.197
Is James a receptive pupil?

25:33.199 --> 25:35.199
At times.

25:35.201 --> 25:38.869
Though too often distracted
by his court duties.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.742
Why are we turning?

25:44.744 --> 25:46.577
Isn't the orphanage
north of the road?

25:46.579 --> 25:47.845
We're not going
to the orphanage anymore.

25:47.847 --> 25:51.615
There's something
I need you to see.

25:51.617 --> 25:54.018
(crowd shouting, clamoring)

25:55.054 --> 25:57.821
KNOX:
Pain follows all sin.

25:57.823 --> 26:00.257
It is the consequence
of wickedness,

26:00.259 --> 26:01.759
the price of adultery.

26:01.761 --> 26:04.728
Even as a witness, her
atonement hurts to see.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.263
Do you feel it?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.765
Her pain?

26:09.168 --> 26:11.869
A man named Lord White
was stopped at the border today.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.705
His arrival was a carefully
guarded secret.

26:14.707 --> 26:17.808
But James
learned of his crossing.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.010
Lord Moray and Mary

26:20.012 --> 26:22.780
have developed an uncanny--
nearly preternatural--

26:22.782 --> 26:24.582
ability to undermine me.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.984
First, she arrived
at the harvest festival

26:26.986 --> 26:29.219
on the very day
I chose to speak.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.822
Later, nobles who
listened to my counsel

26:31.824 --> 26:34.658
found themselves cast out
of Mary's inner circle.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.794
My secret couriers
were apprehended

26:36.796 --> 26:38.596
more and more often.

26:38.598 --> 26:39.830
A pattern was forming.

26:39.832 --> 26:42.666
So I had
our home watched.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.739
You betrayed me, Emily.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.307
You betrayed our marriage

26:50.309 --> 26:52.142
with Lord James.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.778
You can't hide
the truth any longer.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.349
(crowd continues shouting)

26:58.351 --> 27:00.250
Don't do this.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.986
I should make you suffer
the consequences,

27:01.988 --> 27:03.187
but I can't.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.356
I love you far too much.

27:05.358 --> 27:08.258
James drew you in
with lies and used you

27:08.260 --> 27:10.628
to his own ends to spy on me.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.229
He used you.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.831
He never loved you.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.800
You must stand before God.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.236
No.
Take off your
shoes and dress.

27:19.238 --> 27:22.773
I can spare you the humiliation
of suffering before men,

27:22.775 --> 27:24.675
but God's divine justice

27:24.677 --> 27:26.143
must be exacted.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.979
And you will leave me
with nothing?

27:28.981 --> 27:30.247
Naked?

27:30.249 --> 27:31.682
Where will I go?

27:31.684 --> 27:34.418
I do not know.

27:34.420 --> 27:37.988
But you will go there...

27:37.990 --> 27:39.690
in shame.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.866
(crying)

27:58.711 --> 28:00.844
Please, you must leave me be.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.980
Then you've made your choice.
I have.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.048
You kissed like
a woman who hadn't.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.749
This isn't a game, Bothwell.

28:05.751 --> 28:07.818
I know, Mary.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.054
You feel something.
I know you do.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.822
It doesn't matter what I feel.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.857
This time tomorrow,
I will be wed, to Darnley.

28:13.859 --> 28:17.928
You must stay away, or it
could be the end of me.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.831
I am not as strong
as you believe me to be.

28:20.833 --> 28:23.200
One misstep between
us could spell

28:23.202 --> 28:26.737
my destruction and
that of everything I hold dear.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.208
♪ ♪

28:39.151 --> 28:41.752
Oh, our family crests
interwoven.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.253
I did it on the boat.

28:43.255 --> 28:46.023
You made this? Yourself?

28:46.025 --> 28:48.425
You think that political
manipulation and poisoning

28:48.427 --> 28:50.327
are my only skills?

28:53.399 --> 28:55.199
I'm really doing this.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.401
You've fought hard
for this achievement--

28:57.403 --> 29:01.472
joining your line with Darnley's
to claim the English throne.

29:02.975 --> 29:06.777
There is much to
gain from being wed.

29:06.779 --> 29:07.778
Cherish it.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.213
You may not love Darnley,

29:09.215 --> 29:12.049
but you are surrounded by people
who love you.

29:12.518 --> 29:15.519
And you carry love within you.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.790
There's a problem,
Your Majesty.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.892
Oh, my.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.861
Spectacular.

29:23.863 --> 29:26.363
Rizzio, what is it?

29:26.365 --> 29:28.532
It's Darnley.

29:30.402 --> 29:31.869
(slurring):
Why does everyone keep saying,

29:31.871 --> 29:33.537
"Do you know what day it is?"

29:33.539 --> 29:35.873
Monday? Tuesday?

29:35.875 --> 29:40.010
I mean, what am I,
someone's social secretary?

29:40.012 --> 29:42.045
(shouts)

29:42.047 --> 29:43.413
(coughing)

29:43.415 --> 29:45.048
It's your
wedding day. Hmm?

29:45.050 --> 29:47.017
That's what everybody,
including your valet,

29:47.019 --> 29:49.086
who tried to pull you
from the pub,

29:49.088 --> 29:51.221
and your bride want
you to remember.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.990
Hello, lovely.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.992
Ooh, lovelies.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.493
All right.
(groans)

29:56.495 --> 29:57.528
You brought the coffee?

29:57.530 --> 30:00.063
Yes.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.532
(grunts)

30:01.534 --> 30:04.501
Here. Drink this, please.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.904
You gonna force me to drink that
the same way that you forced me

30:06.906 --> 30:08.172
out of that meeting?

30:08.174 --> 30:09.339
It was humiliating.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.809
I am an adult.

30:11.811 --> 30:14.444
I can meet with the Church
if I like,

30:14.446 --> 30:17.047
and I can drink what I like
as well.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.550
Yeah, a good deal of whiskey
would be my guess.

30:19.552 --> 30:20.984
Just to get me
through the wedding.

30:21.887 --> 30:23.287
I'm surprised you're not drunk.

30:23.289 --> 30:26.056
At least I get a crown
out of the deal.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.559
But why on earth,
when I've betrayed you,

30:28.561 --> 30:30.594
when you know
that I love another,

30:30.596 --> 30:36.033
when I blame you for her loss,
do you still want to marry me?

30:38.938 --> 30:40.988
Oh, right.

30:40.989 --> 30:43.039
It's my blood claim
to Elizabeth's throne.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.375
Because of your determination
to take England

30:45.377 --> 30:47.544
before Elizabeth destroys you.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.852
Off we go, then.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.589
(gasps)

30:58.591 --> 31:00.591
It doesn't have to be like this.

31:00.593 --> 31:02.292
I want to forgive,

31:02.294 --> 31:03.927
and I want forgiveness.

31:03.929 --> 31:05.395
I want to start anew.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.865
And I want to be a better man.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.867
I do.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.936
But what are the odds of that?

31:15.307 --> 31:17.374
(church bell tolling)

31:20.646 --> 31:21.645
You don't have to do that.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.647
Actually, I do.

31:23.649 --> 31:27.050
Catherine likes the idea of
people being ushered inside.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.086
Also, I'd like to.

31:31.624 --> 31:33.357
Wait.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.259
I have to thank you.

31:35.261 --> 31:38.061
Rose is with her father, and
it's touching to see someone--

31:38.063 --> 31:39.930
even someone as clueless

31:39.932 --> 31:42.366
about obligations
and family as Martin--

31:42.368 --> 31:44.968
feel the love I feel
for my flesh and blood.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.203
I'm glad.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.906
There's... something else.

31:48.908 --> 31:52.643
As evidenced by my association
with a pirate,

31:52.645 --> 31:54.978
I've had
a rather checkered past.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.246
With men,

31:56.248 --> 31:58.115
with love.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.951
There were issues of station,

32:00.953 --> 32:03.921
guilt or foolishness.

32:03.923 --> 32:07.958
And while I love my daughter
with all my heart,

32:07.960 --> 32:09.660
I wouldn't undo any of it.

32:09.662 --> 32:11.361
I can't help wishing

32:11.363 --> 32:15.432
that at the right time,
I'd met someone...

Murdering her

Disowning

35:46.145 --> 35:47.811
and disavowing me,

A gift from their queen.

38:30.876 --> 38:34.377
Catherine, you are brilliant.

38:34.379 --> 38:36.680
Not as brilliant as you,

38:36.682 --> 38:39.349
as your wedding
to Darnley--

38:39.351 --> 38:41.618
an unworthy husband,

38:41.620 --> 38:44.888
to be sure, but the
right man to wed.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.967
You have drawn the might
of Catholic nations

38:57.969 --> 38:59.636
to your side,
even as you have

38:59.638 --> 39:01.705
sown tolerance.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.406
And in taking a king,

39:03.408 --> 39:06.409
you have given the people

Still, I can't believe it.

39:14.986 --> 39:18.555
More than a dozen towns
turned so fast.

39:18.557 --> 39:21.091

39:21.093 --> 39:23.026
You have earned
their love

39:23.028 --> 39:25.028

have returned home.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.364

39:29.935 --> 39:32.369

to your chambers.

39:32.371 --> 39:35.372
Darnley went
there directly.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.807
I heard.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.726
Because I am queen,

39:39.727 --> 39:41.644
I could dismiss
the viewing of the consummation.

39:41.646 --> 39:42.979
And there won't be one.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.948

God willing, I will never
have to lay with that man again.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.154
Understood.

39:51.156 --> 39:54.758
Make an excuse tonight
and feign illness tomorrow

39:54.760 --> 39:57.060
and then embark on
trips away from court.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.413
And when you return,

39:59.414 --> 40:01.765
tell him you're pregnant,
making sex out of the question.

40:04.569 --> 40:08.505
But, Mary, you cannot
live the life of a nun.

40:08.507 --> 40:11.574

I will have love in my life.

40:11.576 --> 40:14.043
Being a mother, a queen--

40:14.045 --> 40:15.545
it will be
more than enough.

40:15.547 --> 40:16.880
It isn't.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.181
Take it from me.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.049

40:20.051 --> 40:21.885
my heart didn't beat
as strongly as yours.

40:21.887 --> 40:24.721
It will drive you
to seek the love of another,

40:24.723 --> 40:27.123
beyond the affection
you bear your child.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.826
Be careful.
