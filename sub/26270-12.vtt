00:01.235 --> 00:03.204
ANNOUNCER: 9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

00:03.237 --> 00:05.239
This right here
is your stop.

00:05.273 --> 00:08.742
Catch all-new episodes
Mondays, and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.776 --> 00:12.012
Empire, Star, and The Resident.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.482
Let's use today
as an opportunity to
celebrate what's to come.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.749
ANNOUNCER:
Only on Fox.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.755
(heart beating)

00:26.260 --> 00:27.395
(exhales)

00:38.038 --> 00:40.874
CHIMNEY:
You're gonna be just fine.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.043
Everything's gonna be
just fine.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.978
You're gonna be fine.

00:56.324 --> 01:00.128
CHIMNEY:
April, I've got
two words for you:

01:00.161 --> 01:02.463
sleeved blankets.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.398
Why would I want that?

01:04.432 --> 01:07.801
Okay. So you're on the sofa
watching TV.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.403
And you get a little chilly.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.972
So your wrap yourself up
in a blanket.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.207
But now you get thirsty.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.475
You want to grab your glass,

01:14.508 --> 01:16.244
but your arms
are under the blanket.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.711
What do you do?

01:17.745 --> 01:21.115
-Take off the blanket.
-What if you didn't have to?

01:21.149 --> 01:23.817
What if the blanket had sleeves?

01:23.851 --> 01:26.086
Now you can grab your glass,
you can use the remote,

01:26.120 --> 01:26.954
talk on the phone,

01:26.987 --> 01:28.722
all while you're still
snuggled up

01:28.756 --> 01:30.558
in your warm and cozy blanket.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.160
A backwards sweater?

01:32.193 --> 01:34.662
-Eh...
-Mr. Han,

01:34.695 --> 01:37.398
last month, you came in
talking about

01:37.431 --> 01:39.233
fitness centers for children.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.502
The month before that, it was...

01:41.535 --> 01:44.071
-what was it?
-Pampered pet parties.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.273
It's like an Avon lady,

01:45.306 --> 01:46.840
-but with squeaky toys
and rawhide.
-Please stop.

01:46.874 --> 01:50.110
I think you need to ask yourself

01:50.144 --> 01:52.146
what it is you want to do
with your life.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.515
I'm an aspiring entrepreneur.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.749
Soon to be a financial mogul.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.452
-Made-up terms.
-Eh.

01:58.486 --> 02:01.622
Not a calling.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.924
Well, this doesn't really feel
like banking, April.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.626
This kind of feels
like it's therapy.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.497
It's banking.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.033
I'll see you next month?

02:14.868 --> 02:18.172
* Hey, I got friends *

02:18.206 --> 02:19.607
* In low places *

02:19.640 --> 02:24.278
* Where the whiskey drowns
and the beer chases *

02:24.312 --> 02:26.614
* My blues away *

02:26.647 --> 02:29.116
Come on! Come on!

02:29.149 --> 02:30.784
* I'll be okay *

02:30.818 --> 02:33.687
I can't hear you!
Let me hear you!

02:33.721 --> 02:37.891
* Hey, I'm not big
on social graces *

02:37.925 --> 02:42.530
* Think I'll slip on down
to the oasis *

02:42.563 --> 02:45.899
* Yeah, I've got friends *

02:45.933 --> 02:49.036
* In low places *

02:49.069 --> 02:52.640
(cheering)

02:52.673 --> 02:54.808
(whooping)

02:54.842 --> 02:57.077
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.747
I will be here all week.
Literally, here all week.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.350
So if you want to sing a song,
please come find me

03:02.383 --> 03:03.917
and give me your song selection.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.554
But please remember,
management has banned

03:06.587 --> 03:08.922
the singing
of "Bohemian Rhapsody."

03:08.956 --> 03:10.758
(booing)

03:10.791 --> 03:13.861
* Lovely lady... *

03:13.894 --> 03:15.062
(sighs)

03:15.095 --> 03:18.399
Hi. "I Love Rock N' Roll."
Please?

03:18.432 --> 03:20.368
Joan Jett.
Song 341. Nice choice.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.536
Britney Spears.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.173
Correction. Song 891.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.508
You're Tina, right?

03:27.541 --> 03:28.676
I've seen you here before.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.678
My buddy manages the place.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.713
I just help him out
from time to time.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.914
I'm actually an entrepreneur.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.084
-What kind?
-Uh... venture capital.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.920
I provide start-ups with enough
money to get off the ground

03:39.953 --> 03:41.689
in exchange for a piece
of their company.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.692
Oh, wow.
So you're an angel investor?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.394
Yes. Yes, I am.

03:46.427 --> 03:49.697
Sounds like you know a bit
about business yourself.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.032
I do. I'm actually studying
business right now.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.034
-Right on.
-(chuckles)

03:54.067 --> 03:57.471
Hey. Uh, shots
are up at the bar.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.172
She's all set.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.912
-What are you, flirting
with the busboy?
-(scoffs)

04:04.945 --> 04:07.881
I was being nice.
It must suck to be him.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.817
* Few times I've been around
that track *

04:09.850 --> 04:11.919
* So it's not just gonna
happen like that *

04:11.952 --> 04:14.154
* 'Cause I ain't no
hollaback girl *

04:14.187 --> 04:15.889
* I ain't no
hollaback girl *

04:15.923 --> 04:17.725
CHIMNEY:
She asked me
if I had a calling.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.593
You need a calling for
a small business loan?

04:19.627 --> 04:20.894
That's what I said.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.297
Well, so maybe sleeved blankets
wasn't the thing.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.766
I'm sure the next idea
will wow them.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.771
I think I'm out of ideas.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.240
That bank lady's right.
I got to find my calling, man.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.610
I mean, seriously,
shouldn't I have, like, by now,

04:36.644 --> 04:39.146
had some kind of moment where
I felt like, "Yeah, this is it"?

04:39.179 --> 04:40.781
This is the thing
I'm supposed to do.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.816
I don't think
that feeling exists.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.018
Most people just want a job
they can stomach,

04:45.052 --> 04:46.754
that pays well enough, you know?

04:46.787 --> 04:47.955
Decent hours...

04:47.988 --> 04:50.758
I've been hustling
since I was 16.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.125
You know how many jobs I've had.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.628
Probably over a hundred.
Nothing's stuck yet.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.929
Well, your first job stuck.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.866
Babysitting me when you
moved in with my family.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.436
And you're still doing it.
Bossing me around, anyway.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.104
Yeah, that's because if there's
one person I know

05:04.137 --> 05:05.639
with less direction
than me, Kevin,

05:05.673 --> 05:08.476
-it's you.
-Yeah, you really been
a terrible influence.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.844
* Few times I've been around
that track *

05:10.878 --> 05:13.514
What's Marco doing?

05:13.547 --> 05:15.215
* 'Cause I ain't no
hollaback girl *

05:15.248 --> 05:17.851
* I ain't no
hollaback girl *

05:22.423 --> 05:25.058
(screaming)

05:30.330 --> 05:32.633
(siren wailing)

05:32.666 --> 05:36.937
("Burning Down the House"
by Talking Heads playing)

05:39.039 --> 05:41.341
* Watch out *

05:41.375 --> 05:43.644
* You might get what
you're after *

05:43.677 --> 05:46.146
* Cool, babies *

05:46.179 --> 05:49.149
* Strange, but not a stranger *

05:49.182 --> 05:53.320
* I'm an ordinary guy *

05:53.353 --> 05:55.756
* Burning down the house. *

06:00.127 --> 06:01.662
Fire captain said
it was a miracle

06:01.695 --> 06:02.996
that everyone got out alive.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.032
Said there was a ton
of code violations.

06:05.065 --> 06:09.336
Like, that dance club
in El Monte a few years back?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.738
Similar situation.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.173
12 people died,
mostly from smoke and panic.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.042
Well, thank God that
didn't happen here.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.878
Except it did. That one woman
went up like a Roman candle.

06:17.911 --> 06:21.715
Howie tackles her to the ground
like a linebacker.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.350
I'm small, but I'm fast,
evidently.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.853
-(laughter)
-Everyone is just freaking out.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.955
Everyone except Howie.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.357
He's totally cool. I mean,
he actually takes charge.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.693
I've never seen him
like this before.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.528
-(screaming)
-Get out the door
and keep moving, out this way.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.230
KEVIN:
He starts guiding people out,
keeping everybody calm,

06:37.264 --> 06:39.232
and he's got 911 on the line.
It was incredible.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.067
Through the door!

06:40.100 --> 06:43.303
Howard? You're a hero.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.272
I don't know about that,
Mrs. Lee.

06:45.305 --> 06:47.140
I just did what I felt
I needed to do.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.910
That's the very definition
of a hero.

06:49.943 --> 06:53.246
So I can expect rent
to be late this month?

06:53.280 --> 06:54.414
(chuckles)

06:54.448 --> 06:56.584
-John.
-What?

06:56.617 --> 06:57.985
I'm glad it burnt down.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.987
And that nobody got killed.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.556
It's time you two got out
of that karaoke dump.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.726
Now you can both go out
and look for real jobs.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.128
Well, actually, Mr. Lee, uh,

07:08.161 --> 07:09.997
I think that "real job"
just found me.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.900
I applied today to join
the L.A. Fire Department

07:12.933 --> 07:14.201
to be a firefighter.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.639
Civil service.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.007
And I feel like
this is something

07:20.040 --> 07:22.075
that I've been called on to do.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.012
-Does that sound corny?
-JOHN: It's a noble pursuit.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.348
-A man's decision.
-Thank you, Mr. Lee.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.619
You should call your father.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.655
Uh, well, you know,

07:34.688 --> 07:37.090
the time difference with Seoul
is tricky, so, uh...

07:37.124 --> 07:39.693
I should wait to see
if I make it through training

07:39.727 --> 07:41.529
and if I'm actually
accepted first.

07:41.562 --> 07:45.533
Howard, um, are you sure?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.134
It's dangerous.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.870
JOHN:
Oh, Anne, you worry too much.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.271
(clears throat)
Actually, the recruiter said

07:51.304 --> 07:54.441
that the fatality rate's
less than 0.3%.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.377
So, statistically, we'd have to
be on the job for over 300 years

07:57.410 --> 07:59.813
before we're likely to die
in the line of duty.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.715
We?

08:01.749 --> 08:03.483
Yeah. I applied, too.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.853
Are you out of your mind?

08:05.886 --> 08:06.854
*

08:06.887 --> 08:08.488
THOMAS:
You see this?

08:08.522 --> 08:10.624
This is a Los Angeles
firefighter patch.

08:10.658 --> 08:13.293
You're all here because
you want to wear one.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.296
Membership into the world's
elite lifesaving service

08:16.329 --> 08:17.631
must be earned.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.332
Physically and mentally,
you'll be tested

08:19.366 --> 08:21.368
as though your life
depended on it.

08:21.401 --> 08:25.906
Because that's the business
we are in. Life and death.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.875
Folks, this is not
just another job.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.543
This is not a hobby.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.378
If you feel the slightest
glimmer of doubt

08:31.411 --> 08:33.714
about your ability to make
that kind of commitment,

08:33.747 --> 08:36.083
then I suggest you head
back out that door.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.484
* Left, left *

08:37.517 --> 08:39.219
Okay. This morning's
training evolution.

08:39.252 --> 08:42.656
A fire's broken out on the third
floor of a five-story walk-up.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.392
Ascend to the roof
and descend to the third floor.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.260
* Left, right, left *

08:47.294 --> 08:49.697
Three points of contact
at all times!

08:49.730 --> 08:50.998
Two hands, one foot!

08:51.031 --> 08:53.200
One hand, two feet!

08:53.233 --> 08:56.670
That's it, steady pace.
Stay focused!

08:56.704 --> 08:58.005
Jensen, take the door!

08:58.038 --> 08:59.673
Come on, Lee,
people are dying up there!

08:59.707 --> 09:03.076
* Ever try to hold
a lightning strike *

09:03.110 --> 09:04.511
The perimeter is your friend.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.847
It will support you
and carry your weight.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.182
Everything else can and will
collapse under your feet.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.051
The most important rule
of rooftop

09:11.084 --> 09:13.721
is never cross-country
on impulse.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.188
Remember science class?

09:15.222 --> 09:17.024
-Heat rises.
-Move, let's go!

09:17.057 --> 09:18.358
Here we go.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.628
Come on!

09:20.661 --> 09:21.629
That's it.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.530
(chain saw revving)

09:23.563 --> 09:24.698
Stay focused!

09:24.732 --> 09:27.367
Keep the pace!
Keep the pace!

09:27.400 --> 09:29.937
* The only one left *

09:29.970 --> 09:32.906
That's it! That's it! Move!

09:35.909 --> 09:36.944
Work as a team!

09:36.977 --> 09:39.146
(indistinct chatter)

09:45.686 --> 09:47.154
Make the cut!

09:48.822 --> 09:51.158
Good job, Lee.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.027
Good job, Han.
Keep it up!

09:55.696 --> 09:56.529
Moving in!

09:56.563 --> 09:58.832
We're only gonna do this
20 more times.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.167
That's it.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.402
There you go.
Let's go! Let's go!

10:02.435 --> 10:03.971
As a team!

10:04.004 --> 10:06.740
* Left, left, right, left *

10:06.774 --> 10:08.241
* They all fall down *

10:08.275 --> 10:11.912
* I'll be the only one left *

10:11.945 --> 10:14.614
*

10:16.850 --> 10:18.952
* The only one left. *

10:18.986 --> 10:21.088
Congratulations, cadets.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.123
You are officially
probationary firefighters

10:23.156 --> 10:26.093
in the Los Angeles
Fire Department.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.260
I have your assignments.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.362
When you hear your house number,

10:29.396 --> 10:30.664
get in line.

10:30.698 --> 10:34.401
Ashe, Martin. 133.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.603
Han, Howard.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.707

10:39.740 --> 10:42.442
Jensen.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.144

10:44.177 --> 10:46.714
Lee, Kevin.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.615
133.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.283
Martinez, Jorge.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.986
127.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.463
-I love this stuff.
-Mm-hmm.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.699
I didn't think
you were gonna like that.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.302
Hey, Eli.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.172
You forget to tip
the delivery guy?

11:12.205 --> 11:14.474
(chuckles)
That's funny.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.910
Uh, I'm Howard Han.
New recruit.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.145
You're late.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.847
I was told 6:30, sir.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.015
Nobody wants their firefighters
showing up on time,

11:22.049 --> 11:25.819
-they want them early.
-Yes, of course, sir.
-(alarm ringing)

11:25.853 --> 11:28.588
-Uh, where do you want me, sir?
-Uh, take care of the table,

11:28.621 --> 11:32.159
then clean the kitchen
and then the crapper.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.294

Five-car pileup...

12:16.603 --> 12:17.905
DISPATCHER:
All units...

12:17.938 --> 12:19.873
KEVIN:
It was crazy. This car,
it hits the streetlight

12:19.907 --> 12:21.608
so the light goes out.
It's completely dark.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.777
We pull in there,
we see the wreck,

12:23.811 --> 12:26.613
get the Jaws of Life,
we pry open that car

12:26.646 --> 12:29.716
like it's a tin can,
we got that little girl out.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.886
DISPATCHER:
Five-alarm fire downtown.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.822

We have a jumper downtown on
the corner of Spring and 2nd.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.234
All units, five-car pileup,

12:47.267 --> 12:50.770
multiple injuries on the 10.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.173
Please be advised,
the wires are down.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.908
Uh, power lines are
in the street.

12:54.942 --> 12:58.078
(mouthing)

12:58.111 --> 12:59.712
Flooding on the 101 highway.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.852
Okay.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.187
(grunting)

13:08.956 --> 13:10.190
Damn it.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.363
(groans)

13:18.698 --> 13:20.600
KEVIN:
Got to the building.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.435
The fire was everywhere.
People were screaming.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.839
-*
-(continues indistinctly)

13:25.873 --> 13:26.840
The fire started coming down.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.876
We saved everybody.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.343
It was amazing.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.346
Howie? How was your shift?

13:40.820 --> 13:43.490
-(alarm ringing)
-Attention Station 118 units,

13:43.523 --> 13:45.592
respond to a traffic accident
with injuries...

13:48.228 --> 13:50.497
All units requested.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.133
Attempted suicide
at 11117 Hartbrook Street,

13:53.166 --> 13:54.367
in North Hollywood.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.503
(echoes): Never supposed
to pull the blade out,

13:56.536 --> 13:58.705
but I guess the guy panicked
when blood

13:58.738 --> 14:00.974
started spurting everywhere.
It was crazy!

14:01.008 --> 14:02.809
Yo, how about the 118, Howie?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.512
Uh, pretty boring stuff.

14:05.545 --> 14:10.017
Uh, jumper, uh, five-car pileup,

14:10.050 --> 14:12.219
couple of gunshot wounds,
you know, the usual.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.021
(laughs)

14:14.054 --> 14:17.090
It's crazy, right?
(laughs)

14:17.124 --> 14:19.192
(alarm ringing)

14:20.961 --> 14:23.696
DISPATCHER:
All units report
to the Los Angeles Forum.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.233
-Yes!
-Multiple stab wounds,
possible fatality.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.534
No, no, I got it.
Finish your meal.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.336
Multiple car collision
on the 5.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.871
Several fatalities
have been reported.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.741
*

14:36.977 --> 14:39.212
You still here?

14:41.381 --> 14:44.217
See what you can do
about the floor, probie.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.654
Yes, sir.

14:53.826 --> 14:54.928
Yes!

14:57.630 --> 14:59.032
Yay!

14:59.066 --> 15:00.467
Come on! Come on!

15:00.500 --> 15:02.569
-Yes!
-(horn honking)

15:04.571 --> 15:06.373
MAURA:
Help!

15:06.406 --> 15:09.409
Help me, please,
somebody please help me, please!

15:09.442 --> 15:10.743
Please-- please,
it's my husband.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.480
I think he's having
a heart attack. Please.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.615
-When did the pain start?
-Oh, uh,

15:15.648 --> 15:17.884
just a few minutes ago.
And he said his chest hurt.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.386
And now he's having
trouble breathing.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.487
My hands.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.455
What's wrong with your hands?

15:22.489 --> 15:24.657
-Tingling.
-Tingling in your hands.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.459
Oh, this is very important, sir.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.828
Do you feel the tingling
just in your hands?

15:28.861 --> 15:30.330
Or do you feel like
it's running down your arm?

15:30.363 --> 15:31.798
Hands. Just hands.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.466
Got to get
the seatbelt off of you.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.503
-Okay, sir, what is your name?
-Dave.
-Dave.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.971
I'm gonna need you to breathe
for me, all right?

15:38.005 --> 15:39.339
I want you to slowly pull air

15:39.372 --> 15:41.174
in through your mouth
for a count of four,

15:41.208 --> 15:43.743
hold it for one second,
then out for a count of four.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.414
You got me?
Okay, breathe in, two,

15:47.447 --> 15:49.582
-three, four, hold.
-(wheezing)

15:49.616 --> 15:52.852
And out, two, three, four, hold.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.621
You're doing great.
Keep doing that, okay?

15:54.654 --> 15:56.823
So, ma'am, um,
what were you guys doing

15:56.856 --> 15:59.192
-before the pain started?
-Um, uh, we went to brunch

15:59.226 --> 16:00.927
and then we had
a walk on the beach.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.663
And he said he wasn't feeling
well so I just drove us here.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.665
Okay. Uh, Dave,
you're doing really great.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.934
Um, tell me about brunch.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.869
Buffet.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.938
Buffet. Right on.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.141
Okay, and, uh,
did you just have one thing?

16:14.174 --> 16:16.476
Or did you have, like,
a little bit of everything?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.611
Bits of everything.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.813
Bits of everything. Yeah, that's
how you do it at a buffet.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.449
Right? Little of this,
little of that.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.117
Before you know it,
you've tried everything.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.985
Um, don't you think you should
use the paddle thingies

16:26.019 --> 16:27.887
and shock his heart
or something?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.489
No, I-I think
he's doing better now.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.624
Dave, do you feel
like you're doing better?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.393
Yeah.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.462
I do.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.365
I feel better.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.867
Oh, the pain.
(belches)

16:40.900 --> 16:44.571
-Ooh.
-See? It's just
probably indigestion.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.673
So you started to feel
the pain in your chest,

16:46.706 --> 16:48.475
and then you started
to panic, right?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.009
Panic attack can look
a lot like a heart attack

16:50.043 --> 16:52.179
to a layperson.
I think you're gonna be fine.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.846
Oh, God.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.049
MAURA:
You are my angel. Come here.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.217
(laughs):
Come here.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.551
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.058
What about that burger place?

17:05.092 --> 17:06.726
Tommy, I hate that place.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.328
Hey, guys, weirdest thing
happened today...

17:08.361 --> 17:09.529
GERRARD:
Hey, wasn't your girlfriend

17:09.562 --> 17:10.930
supposed to come
and cook us dinner?

17:10.963 --> 17:13.933
-TOMMY: Uh, next Tuesday.
-GERRARD: Promise?

17:13.966 --> 17:17.070
TOMMY:
Uh-- uh, yes.
Yeah, I will promise...

17:21.040 --> 17:22.942
(Skype ringing)

17:28.415 --> 17:30.550
Hello.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.356
Howard?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.558
Yep. It's your other kid.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.436
Dad, I don't need money.
I've got some news.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.671
I got a new job.
I joined the fire department.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.875
It's not just fires,
it's fire and rescue.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.977
I save lives.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.418
Right. Of course. You know what?

18:05.452 --> 18:07.587
Sorry to bother you.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.392
No, I'm okay, Pop.
I was just calling to check in.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.927
It's nothing...

18:14.961 --> 18:16.429
(Skype beeps)

18:20.333 --> 18:22.469
Nothing important.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.913
I thought it would be
a good time to call Seoul.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.682
It wasn't.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.318
-Your father...
-I know.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.953
He's a very, very busy man.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.522
He's a jackass.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.757
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
be calling him names.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.595
No, no, no, no, no. I like where
this is going. Please, continue.

18:48.628 --> 18:52.499
Your mother, your mother
was so vibrant.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.467
So full of joy.

18:54.501 --> 18:59.639
I just, I never understood how
she ended up married to such

18:59.672 --> 19:01.841
-a colorless man.
-(chuckles)

19:04.577 --> 19:07.314
I miss her.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.482
So do I.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.188
She was my best friend.

19:15.222 --> 19:19.559
If you and Mr. Lee hadn't taken
pity on me after she died...

19:19.592 --> 19:21.861
It wasn't pity.

19:24.264 --> 19:30.169
We took you in
because we love you, Howie.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.171
You're family.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.480
Then that's all I need.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.749
(laughs, sniffles)

20:08.541 --> 20:10.710
*

20:38.738 --> 20:41.741
Hey, man,
let's build a bridge here, huh?

20:43.610 --> 20:44.944
Come on.

20:44.977 --> 20:48.147
What about movies?
I've seen them all.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.216
Sports? I can tell
the difference

20:50.249 --> 20:54.621
between a home run
and a touchdown. Kind of.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.489
TV, Broadway,
classic literature,

20:56.523 --> 20:58.725
tell me what your thing is,
and I'll make it mine.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.395
Let's just be cool here, man.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.064
You know, I'm told I have
formidable people skills,

21:05.097 --> 21:07.934
but you just really don't
like me much, do you?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.637
If I thought about you at all,

21:10.670 --> 21:13.272
honestly, I probably wouldn't.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.310
Suit up, Han.
You're with me today.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.645
I cleared it with the captain.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.980
Yeah, but I'm not a paramedic.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.915
I mean, you're not much
of a firefighter, either.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.151
But you can stay here
and play butler or, you know...

21:25.184 --> 21:28.421
No, no, no! Put me in the game,
coach. I'm ready to play.

21:28.455 --> 21:31.524
Fair warning, this is a "careful
what you wish for" situation.

21:31.558 --> 21:33.860
*

21:33.893 --> 21:35.962
(siren wailing, horns honking)

21:38.297 --> 21:39.332
Oh!

21:39.366 --> 21:41.133
Where's it all coming from?

21:41.167 --> 21:43.302
-Worry about where
it's going. Here.
-(retches)

21:45.572 --> 21:46.973
* Well, I'm running... *

21:47.006 --> 21:49.609
Put pressure here,
grab the tourniquet.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.043
* Well, I'm running *

21:51.077 --> 21:53.380
* Police on my back *

21:53.413 --> 21:55.448
Turn his head,
prevent him from aspirating.

21:55.482 --> 21:56.616
Got to keep his airway clear.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.117
* And the victim *

21:58.150 --> 21:59.318
* Well, he won't come back... *

21:59.352 --> 22:02.522
-Oh-- oh! Oh, my God.
-Come on. Latch it.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.491
* Wednesday, Thursday, Friday *

22:04.524 --> 22:06.826
* Saturday, Sunday... *

22:06.859 --> 22:08.461
-Focus, yank it.
-Stem the blood loss.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.397
This job is science
meets rock and roll.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.898
If we don't improv, people die.

22:11.931 --> 22:15.001
* What have I done? *

22:15.034 --> 22:16.469
* What
have I done? *

22:16.503 --> 22:17.570
-Oh...
-I'm dying.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.806
You're not dying, sir,
you're gonna be just fine.

22:19.839 --> 22:23.476
* Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday... *

22:23.510 --> 22:24.977
ELI:
You having fun?

22:25.011 --> 22:27.213
I can see why they don't
put this in the brochure.

22:27.246 --> 22:30.550
* What have I done? *

22:30.583 --> 22:31.818
You're gonna be just fine, sir.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.686
-Ah, ah.
-I'm sorry!

22:33.720 --> 22:35.087
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

22:35.121 --> 22:37.056
(sirens wailing)

22:45.798 --> 22:48.134
(dispatcher
speaking indistinctly)

23:00.547 --> 23:01.748
Thanks.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.787
It's not personal, you know.

23:11.991 --> 23:16.395
Look, in this job, friends die
and funerals are held.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.197
They're not gonna just
give you their friendship

23:18.230 --> 23:19.899
until you earn their respect.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.270
They're not just protecting you,
they're protecting themselves.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.540
You don't name a puppy
until you know

23:27.574 --> 23:28.808
it's gonna pull through.

23:28.841 --> 23:32.244
Oh, so in this scenario,
I'm a puppy?

23:32.278 --> 23:34.046
There you go.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.215
(laughs)

23:36.248 --> 23:39.886
You know, when I saw
these guys, I just thought

23:39.919 --> 23:43.022
they're heroes;
maybe I could be one, too.

23:44.423 --> 23:48.094
When I saved that girl
at the bar,

23:48.127 --> 23:50.096
for a second there I felt,

23:50.129 --> 23:54.433
maybe for the first time ever,
not heroic, just...

23:54.467 --> 23:56.235
useful.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.605
I never saw myself old,
with a family,

23:58.638 --> 24:01.508
so I figured, what the hell,
live fast, die young.

24:01.541 --> 24:05.244
Pull some folks through
a burning building in slo-mo.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.013
(laughs)

24:07.046 --> 24:09.115
Yeah, but that's only
half the job.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.817
I mean, when you
come out of that building,

24:10.850 --> 24:12.418
you got to give 'em to me.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.120
And if I let 'em die,
then all that...

24:14.153 --> 24:17.957
all that effort, all that risk,
it was for nothing.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.761
But that's why you became
a paramedic?

24:21.794 --> 24:24.497
It wasn't 'cause
I liked the schooling.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.332
(laughs)

24:26.365 --> 24:29.702
A few years ago, I pulled
a ten-year-old third-degree

24:29.736 --> 24:31.170
out of a car fire.

24:31.203 --> 24:34.206
Right? And I handed her off
to some rookie M.D.,

24:34.240 --> 24:35.842
who everyone said
was a golden boy,

24:35.875 --> 24:39.245
and I watched him
do everything wrong.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.883
She died on that scene
before we left.

24:48.154 --> 24:51.023
Yeah, but for you, it's-it's not
about the rush anymore?

24:51.057 --> 24:52.559
You know, the thrill?

24:52.592 --> 24:55.127
If that's the question you're
gonna ask after that,

24:55.161 --> 24:57.396
I am sorry in advance
for the lesson

24:57.429 --> 24:59.298
-you're gonna learn.
-(alarm ringing)

24:59.331 --> 25:01.868
DISPATCHER:
Attention Station 118 units,

25:01.901 --> 25:03.335
respond to a structure fire...

25:03.369 --> 25:07.473
We got a barn burner.
Mount up.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.209
You, too, probie.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.178
Get in.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.729
(sirens wailing)

25:29.762 --> 25:32.865
(heart pounding)

25:36.736 --> 25:39.538
(horn honking)

25:41.540 --> 25:43.042
MADDIE:
Chim?

25:50.650 --> 25:53.953
Metro, this is 118,
on scene and in command.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.187
MAN (over radio):
Thank God you made it.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.523
The fire is spreading quickly.

25:57.556 --> 26:01.060
Sir, sir, it's like an inferno
in there!

26:01.093 --> 26:04.096
We need to get this ventilated.
Let's move!

26:06.733 --> 26:08.901
Finally.

26:17.476 --> 26:20.647
Keep moving.
We need to vent this fire out.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.348
Look for weak spots
so that we can cut through.

26:32.491 --> 26:35.061
(indistinct chatter)

26:35.094 --> 26:36.162
(chain saw revving)

26:36.195 --> 26:37.930
All right, let's do it here!

26:37.964 --> 26:40.266
Give me a hole right here!

26:48.040 --> 26:50.109
Yeah, right there!

26:57.850 --> 26:59.485
*

27:11.630 --> 27:13.499
-Radio down, let's go.
-All right.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.334
THOMAS:
The perimeter is your friend.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.770
It will support you
and carry your weight.

27:17.804 --> 27:21.340
Everything else can and will
collapse under your feet.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.644
(coughing)

27:28.715 --> 27:30.983
(crying)

27:33.986 --> 27:36.122
CHIMNEY:
Don't move! Stay right there!

27:36.155 --> 27:38.124
Ma'am, stay right there,
do not move!

27:38.157 --> 27:39.291
Stay there!

27:39.325 --> 27:40.893
CHIMNEY:
No, don't move!

27:40.927 --> 27:42.461
-Don't move!
-Don't move!

27:42.494 --> 27:43.562
-CHIMNEY: Stay right there!
-(creaking)

27:43.595 --> 27:44.797
We'll come to you!

27:44.831 --> 27:45.798
Right there, don't move!

27:45.832 --> 27:47.734
Don't move-- stay!

27:47.767 --> 27:48.701
Do not move!

27:54.841 --> 27:56.743
Kevin, no!

27:56.776 --> 27:58.277
(shouts)

28:00.046 --> 28:01.580
Are you okay?

28:01.613 --> 28:03.049
(coughing)

28:19.098 --> 28:20.399
CHIMNEY:
Mayday.

28:20.432 --> 28:23.002
We got a firefighter
who's gone through the roof.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.004
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.239
(continues indistinctly)

28:28.741 --> 28:30.709
Now!

28:49.461 --> 28:52.431
-I'm so sorry.
-(crying)

28:58.670 --> 28:59.972
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

29:00.006 --> 29:02.141
(wailing)

29:12.651 --> 29:14.887
FIRE CHIEF (echoing):
Throughout most of history,

29:14.921 --> 29:18.424
the lives of firefighters
have been closely associated

29:18.457 --> 29:20.559
with the ringing of a bell.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.395
As they began
their hours of duty,

29:23.429 --> 29:26.933
it was the bell
that started it off.

29:26.966 --> 29:30.736
Through the day and night, each
alarm was sounded by a bell

29:30.769 --> 29:34.473
that called them to fight fire
and to place their lives

29:34.506 --> 29:37.243
in jeopardy for the good
of their fellow man.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.178
And when the fire was out,

29:39.211 --> 29:41.914
and the alarm
had come to an end,

29:41.948 --> 29:45.651
the bell rang ten times
to signal that end.

29:45.684 --> 29:48.587
-(bell rings)
-And now,

29:48.620 --> 29:52.758
our brother Kevin Lee has
completed his task...

29:52.791 --> 29:55.294
(guns firing)

30:20.652 --> 30:22.554
*

30:42.341 --> 30:44.576
(heart beating)

30:52.384 --> 30:55.554
THOMAS:
Never cross-country on impulse.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.524
ELI:
Hey. It's good to see you.

30:58.557 --> 31:01.193
Wasn't sure you'd be back.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.595
Didn't have anywhere else to go.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.378
(sirens wailing, horns honking)

31:26.052 --> 31:27.686
Officer, what do you got?

31:27.719 --> 31:30.256
Shopping center expanding
its underground parking garage,

31:30.289 --> 31:31.757
but somebody screwed up.

31:31.790 --> 31:34.126
The entire floor collapsed
in the biggest store.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.762
Now, they're telling me it
shifted down about three feet,

31:36.795 --> 31:40.066
but the floor is still there,
just be careful where you step.

31:40.099 --> 31:43.502
All right, people. Standard
search and rescue. Let's move!

31:45.237 --> 31:48.074
-Cap, I'm gonna help Eli out.
-Go.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.942
Hi, I'm Howie.
I'm gonna be checking you out.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.510
How's your breathing?

31:53.245 --> 31:54.513
Can you follow my finger?

31:56.315 --> 31:58.417
-This one's stable.
-Squeeze my hand.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.752
Headache? Let me check this out.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.991
Okay.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.225
Can you follow my finger?

32:06.258 --> 32:08.227
And you don't
normally get migraines?

32:08.260 --> 32:09.828
Not even headaches.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.964
And it started after
the first floor collapsed?

32:13.032 --> 32:14.633
Before, actually.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.835
I think it's all
the folding I do.

32:16.868 --> 32:20.572
I work in the fitting room
and no one-- and I mean no one--

32:20.606 --> 32:22.008
ever folds their clothes.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.946
MAN:
Oh, my head.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.481
You have a headache, huh?

32:29.515 --> 32:31.617
-Feels like a migraine?
-Uh-huh.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.685
ATHENA:
All right, this looks
to be the last of them.

32:33.719 --> 32:35.587
Your captain's calling it.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.924
I'm-a start sending over members
of the construction crew.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.459
Foreman's telling me a few of
his guys have been hurling

32:40.492 --> 32:42.028
for the last hour.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.630
Okay, thank you, Officer.
Hey, Eli, you hearing this?

32:44.663 --> 32:46.532
I'm getting vomiting
and headaches.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.334
Maybe they broke
a gas main down there?

32:48.367 --> 32:50.202
We'd be smelling it.
The lines are intact.

32:50.236 --> 32:52.371
Kinard. It's all clear.

32:54.140 --> 32:57.109
Tommy, come in.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.945
O'Conner. Where's Tommy?

32:59.978 --> 33:01.113
He was right behind me.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.981
*

33:04.150 --> 33:06.052
(heart beating)

33:06.085 --> 33:08.720
Officer, clear everyone back
from this building!

33:08.754 --> 33:12.224
-I think it's a methane leak!
-What does that probie
think he's doing?

33:12.258 --> 33:15.294
Move away from the building!
Everyone, let's go!

33:15.327 --> 33:16.928
-Everybody move away!
-Let's go!

33:21.500 --> 33:23.035
(people screaming)

33:26.372 --> 33:28.040
Back! Back!

33:28.074 --> 33:30.076
(grunting)

33:38.217 --> 33:41.520
* Wake *

33:41.553 --> 33:43.689
* From your sleep *

33:46.425 --> 33:49.528
* The drying of *

33:49.561 --> 33:54.400
* Your tears *

33:54.433 --> 33:57.169
* Today *

33:57.203 --> 33:59.638
* We escape *

34:01.307 --> 34:04.443
* We escape... *

34:11.049 --> 34:13.919
* Breathe *

34:16.388 --> 34:18.624
* Keep breathing *

34:20.592 --> 34:23.929
* Don't lose... *

34:23.962 --> 34:25.231
You still here?

34:25.264 --> 34:27.999
* Your nerve *

34:34.773 --> 34:38.144
* You can *

34:38.177 --> 34:39.478
* Laugh *

34:39.511 --> 34:40.746
(screams)

34:42.181 --> 34:43.215
* A spineless *

34:43.249 --> 34:44.416
MADDIE:
Chimney?

34:46.352 --> 34:49.655
* Laugh *

34:49.688 --> 34:53.058
* We hope your... *

34:53.091 --> 34:54.960
CHIMNEY:
I applied today to join
the L.A. Fire Department

34:54.993 --> 34:57.563
-to be a firefighter.
-KEVIN: I applied, too.

34:57.596 --> 35:00.899
* Wisdom *

35:00.932 --> 35:06.071
* Choke you now. *

35:06.104 --> 35:08.407
ELI:
Hey.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.675
Hey.

35:09.708 --> 35:13.279
Part of the job is learning
to love terrible coffee.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.946
-Tommy?
-Resting.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.083
Well, I got to say, for a guy

35:18.116 --> 35:20.252
who huffed gas and got dragged
out of a burning building,

35:20.286 --> 35:23.922
-he looks better than you do.
-(chuckles)

35:23.955 --> 35:26.858
Yeah, well, the Ramada,
this is not.

35:26.892 --> 35:30.529
Shift starts in about an hour,
I'll clean up at the station.

35:32.198 --> 35:34.166
Hand it off, man.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.769
Sorry?

35:37.803 --> 35:40.806
You're gonna get hurt
in this business.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.811
You, me, them.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.847
Hell, we all signed up
for it, right?

35:48.880 --> 35:51.483
We raised our hands
and said, "Yes, please,"

35:51.517 --> 35:52.984
to the burns
and the broken bones,

35:53.018 --> 35:56.455
the cartoon bruises,
two weeks without eyebrows.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.024
Right?

35:59.057 --> 36:02.093
But you know that's not
the hurt I'm talking about.

36:04.062 --> 36:07.666
You're right, this coffee sucks.
(chuckles)

36:10.836 --> 36:13.472
The things that can't be treated
with ointment and a splint

36:13.505 --> 36:15.006
are the things that'll kill us.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.576
The guilt,

36:17.609 --> 36:19.645
the loss,

36:19.678 --> 36:21.179
the images...

36:23.081 --> 36:25.817
We can't drink or sniff

36:25.851 --> 36:27.686
or screw them away.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.058
Hand it off.

36:37.263 --> 36:40.566
Kevin died, Eli.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.602
And Tommy didn't because of you.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.441
I know it's easy
when the girl's on fire or

36:49.475 --> 36:53.845
the guy's bleeding out to think
that we're God, but we ain't.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.915
You got to let
that ego burn away, man.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.084
You are not that powerful.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.722
Hand it off.

37:05.391 --> 37:08.294
We treat the wounded,
we hand them off.

37:08.327 --> 37:12.298
These doctors, they do
their job, they hand them off,

37:12.331 --> 37:14.266
to God or the universe, karma,

37:14.300 --> 37:17.436
wh-whatever the hell
you want to call it. Hey.

37:17.469 --> 37:22.140
But we hand them off so that
we can pick up the next guy.

37:22.173 --> 37:25.744
And at the end of the day,
maybe ourselves.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.279
Because if we don't...

37:30.782 --> 37:33.051
We become the patients.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.754
And the world has
too many of them.

37:35.787 --> 37:38.790
What it needs
is more caregivers.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.396
So...

37:44.430 --> 37:46.164
Come on.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.268
(groans)

37:50.302 --> 37:52.270
Go give care.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.641
Right.

37:55.674 --> 37:59.311
-But first, better coffee.
-(chuckles)

37:59.345 --> 38:00.812
And a decent breakfast,

38:00.846 --> 38:03.349
on you for the sage advice.

38:03.382 --> 38:05.150
(chuckles) Right.

38:07.052 --> 38:10.356
All right. You have
your wallet, right?

38:10.389 --> 38:12.924
-Oh, you know, I think...
-Ah, you have your wallet.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.126
-Sorry, buddy. (laughs)
-You got your wallet.

38:23.402 --> 38:26.338

38:32.344 --> 38:34.279
Mrs. Lee, hi.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.648
Hello, Howard.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.617
It's good to see you.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.986
It's good to see you, too.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.622
I'm so sorry.
Here, please, come in.

38:43.655 --> 38:47.626
I apologize. I'm-I'm just
getting settled in right now.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.260
I know it's a mess.

38:51.997 --> 38:56.368
Uh, here, for your new home.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.404
We wish you prosperity.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.272
Thank you.

39:03.375 --> 39:04.976
So, uh...

39:05.010 --> 39:06.745
how's Mr. Lee doing?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.682
(sighs)

39:10.716 --> 39:13.084
He couldn't come, not yet.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.755
Please forgive him.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.356
Forgive me.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.261
But it's not your fault.

39:23.294 --> 39:26.031
I'm the one who got Kevin into
this. I'm the reason that...

39:29.468 --> 39:31.670
I knew my boy.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.840
When he was sad,
when he was happy.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.342
I had never seen him happier.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.344
Being a firefighter,

39:39.377 --> 39:42.581
finally having something
important to do.

39:42.614 --> 39:45.517
All you did was help him

39:45.551 --> 39:48.053
find his purpose.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.730
I don't know what I'm gonna do
without him. (chuckles)

39:58.764 --> 40:00.866
He'll be watching over you,

40:00.899 --> 40:03.869
along with your mother.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.771
Both of them

40:05.804 --> 40:08.907
so proud.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.076
All of us, mm?

40:15.481 --> 40:18.249
*

40:19.350 --> 40:21.286
Thank you.

40:32.030 --> 40:35.934
Love Actually,
monster trucks, craft beer.

40:35.967 --> 40:39.771
(chuckles) So you're back?

40:41.139 --> 40:44.409
-How's that head of yours?
-Still fat,

40:44.442 --> 40:45.977
but clearer.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.615
You saved my life.

40:49.648 --> 40:52.283
Thank you.

41:02.628 --> 41:05.030
-Thanks, Tommy.
-ELI: Come on.

41:05.063 --> 41:07.465
Somebody out here
wants to talk to you.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.129
Hi. Hello.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.398
We just wanted to come here
and thank you.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.901
You're the reason
that we're both alive.

41:42.934 --> 41:46.572
Uh, so who do we have here?

41:46.605 --> 41:48.840
This is Adam. Say hi.

41:48.874 --> 41:50.842
Hi, Adam.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.144
He still needs a middle name.

41:53.178 --> 41:54.646
Oh.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.981
Uh...

41:56.014 --> 41:58.516
My name's Howie.

42:00.719 --> 42:02.954
-Oh...
-Well, it's Howard.

42:04.590 --> 42:06.558
You know what? I think
I'm gonna have to earn

42:06.592 --> 42:08.894
some kind of cool nickname.
"Howie's" just not gonna cut it,

42:08.927 --> 42:10.562
is it? (chuckles)

42:10.596 --> 42:11.863
(Adam fusses)

42:14.399 --> 42:16.902
You know, I think
he looks like a Kevin.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.240
(Adam coos)

42:24.576 --> 42:26.511
TOMMY:
Paramedic, huh?

42:26.544 --> 42:27.913
Damn good one.

42:31.717 --> 42:35.053
(sirens wailing)

42:42.894 --> 42:44.529
* The bittersweet
between my teeth... *

42:44.562 --> 42:48.133
ELI: We have a GSW five minutes
out. Patient is stable.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.801
Getting the bleeding
under control now,

42:49.835 --> 42:52.403
-just give me a second.
-You need me to get in there?

42:52.437 --> 42:55.040
-No, I got it.
-I'm dying!

42:55.073 --> 42:56.374
Sir, you're gonna be just fine.

42:56.407 --> 42:57.743
Bullet went straight through.
It's your upper shoulder,

42:57.776 --> 43:01.546
and it's no veins or arteries.
You're just in shock.

43:01.579 --> 43:05.150
Just turn your head.
One second. Okay...

43:05.183 --> 43:08.086
-(retches)
-Deep breaths.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.587
Deep breaths.

43:09.621 --> 43:10.689
You're gonna be fine.

43:10.722 --> 43:13.058
* Fall back in love
eventually... *

43:13.091 --> 43:15.293
You're gonna be fine.

43:15.326 --> 43:17.362
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. *
