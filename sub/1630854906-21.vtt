WEBVTT

00:27.403 --> 00:28.404
Dembe Zuma?

00:29.697 --> 00:30.698
It's for you.

00:36.871 --> 00:37.872
Hello?

00:37.872 --> 00:41.834
Dembe, that was incredibly reckless
calling to warn me off.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.502
How did you know
I was at the mosque?

00:43.502 --> 00:44.837
What were you thinking?

00:44.837 --> 00:46.297
<i>I was thinking about death,</i>

00:46.297 --> 00:49.383
possibly yours
or some hapless FBI agent.

00:49.383 --> 00:53.012
I see. Well,
it was foolhardy, short-sighted.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.346
And it worked.

00:54.346 --> 00:55.848
<i>But at what cost?</i>

00:55.848 --> 00:57.850
You've done something
in the last few years

00:57.850 --> 00:59.310
I never thought possible.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.520
<i>You wiped your slate clean.</i>

01:01.520 --> 01:03.731
You joined the FBI of all things.

01:05.149 --> 01:07.276
Don't go throwing away
your future on my account.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.779
Nobody knows I made the call.

01:09.779 --> 01:12.823
Good. That Congressman
is looking for any excuse,

01:12.823 --> 01:14.992
<i>especially when it comes to you.</i>

01:14.992 --> 01:17.453
So don't do me any more favors.

01:17.453 --> 01:18.537
<i>I won't.</i>

01:18.537 --> 01:20.623
<i>I'm going to bring you in, Raymond.</i>

01:21.290 --> 01:22.291
That's the spirit.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.001
<i>I'm serious.</i>

01:25.169 --> 01:26.921
I hope so. For your sake.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.923
Be safe, Dembe.

01:30.841 --> 01:31.842
You, too.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.144
Chuck, slight change of plans.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.480
How quickly can you get ahold
of our friend Bertha?

01:55.783 --> 01:57.535
Come on, people. Debrief in 20.

01:57.535 --> 01:58.786
I want to hear some good news.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.080
Mr. Cooper, perhaps you can
explain something to me.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.374
Reddington blew up his own jet
to get away from us.

02:03.374 --> 02:04.625
Then he turns around,

02:04.625 --> 02:06.001
comes all the way back to the city

02:06.001 --> 02:08.462
just so you two can have
a cozy chat in your kitchen?

02:08.462 --> 02:10.089
How does that make any sense?

02:10.089 --> 02:13.175
It doesn't,
but his behavior rarely does.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.468
Not from the outside, anyway.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.136
Well, I guess
we should be grateful

02:16.136 --> 02:17.638
for his lapse in judgement.

02:18.681 --> 02:20.975
Barricades went up as soon
as you reported the incident.

02:20.975 --> 02:24.019
This entire area has been
shut down and sealed off.

02:24.019 --> 02:27.648
He was last seen driving this,
a 2018 Nissan Leaf.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.401
He disabled the GPS,
but we got the plate number,

02:30.401 --> 02:33.988
so our first order of business
is to find that car.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.156
I'm sorry,
but our first order of business

02:36.156 --> 02:38.033
should be to throw out the playbook.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.618
You may want to think of Raymond

02:39.618 --> 02:41.287
as an ordinary criminal.

02:41.287 --> 02:43.038
That would be a mistake.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.874
I realize you all
spent years with the man,

02:44.874 --> 02:46.125
and you feel like
you know him better--

02:46.125 --> 02:48.502
It's been over a decade,
and I still don't <i>know</i> him.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.630
But there are a few things
we should probably explain.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.465
<i>His personal assets are in the billions,</i>

02:53.465 --> 02:56.510
<i>the scope of his influence,
basically unlimited.</i>

02:56.510 --> 02:58.721
<i>And those are just
his external resources.</i>

02:58.721 --> 03:01.765
It's his mind you should
be worried about.

03:01.765 --> 03:02.850
No matter where he is,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.476
the time of day, weather conditions.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.980
He has escape routes
within escape routes.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.899
Okay, keys and money
are in the envelope.

03:09.899 --> 03:12.109
The car's outside.
Oh, and take this card.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.694
If you get arrested, call the number,

03:13.694 --> 03:14.904
somebody'll bail you out.

03:14.904 --> 03:15.988
Have a nice drive.

03:17.281 --> 03:18.616
Keys and money are in the envelope.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.159
Your car's outside. Take this card.

03:20.159 --> 03:21.619
If you get arrested, call the number,

03:21.619 --> 03:22.703
somebody'll bail you out.

03:23.287 --> 03:24.830
<i>Have you ever heard
the expression</i>

03:24.830 --> 03:26.081
<i>"He sleeps with one eye open"?</i>

03:26.582 --> 03:27.791
I've actually seen him do that.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.627
I think what
we're trying to say is,

03:29.627 --> 03:31.545
he's a real tricky customer.

03:32.671 --> 03:33.881
The way you all build him up,

03:33.881 --> 03:35.716
it almost sounds like you admire him.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.301
Oh, it's not admiration, it's a warning.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.094
I don't care if he's Lex Luthor.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.512
Reddington's not getting outside--

03:40.512 --> 03:42.264
MPD just flagged his plate!

03:42.264 --> 03:44.892
Heading east over
Woodrow Wilson Bridge.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.061
Damn, he got past the police barricade?

03:47.061 --> 03:48.604
Let's get choppers in the air.

03:48.604 --> 03:50.314
We need to shut all traffic heading--

03:50.314 --> 03:52.274
Sir, Virginia State troopers
just pulled over

03:52.274 --> 03:54.944
a Nissan Leaf moving west on I-66.

03:54.944 --> 03:57.154
- The plate's a match.
- How the hell is he--

03:57.154 --> 03:58.572
I don't understand.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.658
Aviation Command says
that they're circling him

04:00.658 --> 04:02.701
on the Anacostia Freeway,
same plate, same car.

04:03.786 --> 04:06.455
I'm not gonna find him
in any of these cars, am I?

04:06.455 --> 04:07.539
I'm afraid not.

04:07.539 --> 04:11.001
Within hours he's somehow
floods DC with identical cars,

04:11.001 --> 04:13.671
so we spend the day
chasing our tails like a bunch of idiots?

04:13.671 --> 04:15.547
Confusion, misdirection,

04:15.547 --> 04:16.924
this is how he operates.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.677
It's kept him safe
for over 30 years on the run.

04:19.677 --> 04:22.680
But you do have one advantage
in this case.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.098
What's that?

04:24.098 --> 04:25.182
Us.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.518
I've gotta make a call,

04:27.518 --> 04:28.644
I'll be back.

04:29.687 --> 04:32.773
Agent Ressler, I wanted to find a moment
to offer my condolences.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.316
Jon Pritchard was a good man--

04:34.316 --> 04:36.402
You know what?
Don't, just don't.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.487
Okay, I just...
I hope you don't blame yourself--

04:38.487 --> 04:41.240
Enough!

04:42.741 --> 04:43.826
That's enough now.

04:46.537 --> 04:47.913
Take him up to my office.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.168
You all right?

04:54.378 --> 04:55.963
Fine. Fine. I shouldn't've--

04:55.963 --> 04:59.049
- Arthur--
- His friend died. Let it go.

05:00.843 --> 05:01.885
Mr. Cooper.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.346
Don't forget why you're here.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.764
We all want the same thing.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.686
All right, people, let's focus up!

05:10.686 --> 05:12.855
The name of the game
is Raymond Reddington.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.690
He's inside that perimeter,

05:14.690 --> 05:16.900
and if he's crawled
into some rat hole,

05:16.900 --> 05:18.610
I wanna know where!

05:23.532 --> 05:25.617
Last Sunday at Perkins,

05:25.617 --> 05:30.497
I put a couple of these
hazelnut creamers in my purse.

05:31.582 --> 05:34.376
Paula, did you happen to read
the paper this morning?

05:34.376 --> 05:38.255
Nope. Too much gloom and doom.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.174
Save me the obits, though.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.885
It's a great way to find eligible men.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.222
One woman's widower
is another woman's gain,

05:47.222 --> 05:48.807
I suppose.

05:48.807 --> 05:52.686
I want to hear your best
funeral pick-up line,

05:52.686 --> 05:54.855
but first, Paula,

05:54.855 --> 05:58.108
there's something important
we need to discuss.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.196
Take a breath.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.406
I'm fine.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.783
Clearly you're not fine.

06:05.783 --> 06:08.702
That's understandable.
But you can't be punching Congressmen.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.370
Especially that one.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.707
Just checking to see
if you're okay.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.250
It suddenly
feels crowded in here.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.170
You realize the investigation
is happening down there?

06:18.170 --> 06:19.421
Yeah, I can't with them.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.299
At the risk of sounding
unprofessional, same.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.551
I realize I haven't known Reddington

06:24.551 --> 06:25.886
as long as you have,

06:25.886 --> 06:28.138
but it still feels weird

06:28.138 --> 06:29.932
teaming up with strangers
to hunt him down.

06:29.932 --> 06:33.060
I don't want to lose my dental,
so don't tell the windbreakers,

06:34.353 --> 06:35.938
but part of me is rooting for Red.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.232
Maybe
part of me is, too.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.609
But personal feelings aside,

06:40.609 --> 06:43.904
the five of us have a decision
to make right here, right now.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.739
This team has always
had one mission,

06:45.739 --> 06:47.282
to bring criminals to justice.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.076
When Reddington was with us,
he understood that.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.285
But he's chosen to walk away.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.662
And now those men down there

06:51.662 --> 06:53.288
have asked us to deliver him up.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.041
We could make their jobs harder
if we want to.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.668
But what would that say about us?

06:59.169 --> 07:02.381
They want us to find Reddington
to save our own skins.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.967
But I want us to find him
because that's who we are.

07:05.509 --> 07:06.677
Now, if you don't agree,

07:06.677 --> 07:09.096
if you can't commit
to using everything you have

07:09.096 --> 07:11.765
to bring Reddington
in to face justice head on,

07:13.392 --> 07:15.018
then you should step aside.

07:22.151 --> 07:23.152
Okay then.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.904
Now we just have to figure out
where the hell he is.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.531
One thing's for sure,

07:27.531 --> 07:29.575
he's gonna get outta DC
as soon as possible.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.662
Andrea? It's Raymond.

07:33.662 --> 07:34.997
I'm curious,

07:34.997 --> 07:38.083
what homes do you have
right now on the market?

07:38.083 --> 07:40.502
<i>Something small, modest,</i>

07:40.502 --> 07:44.047
<i>east of Capitol Street, south of the Mall.</i>

07:44.047 --> 07:47.509
I do have one a little further west
in Adams Morgan.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.595
<i>Updated kitchen,</i>

07:49.595 --> 07:51.305
nice hardwood floors...

07:51.305 --> 07:53.932
No, no, no.
That won't do, I'm afraid.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.934
My needs are quite specific.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.769
Okay.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.980
I have something on Westover Drive,

07:59.980 --> 08:01.732
bit of a fixer-upper.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.775
Actually, never mind.

08:03.775 --> 08:06.195
Too much fixer, not enough upper.

08:06.195 --> 08:08.363
Is it owner-occupied?

08:08.363 --> 08:10.157
<i>No, it's vacant.</i>

08:10.157 --> 08:11.950
Hmm. Sounds perfect.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.911
It's a total gut.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.787
I don't even think
it has a functioning toilet.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.414
Not to worry, Andrea.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.042
We'll be taking it right down
to the foundation.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.501
You understand what I'm saying?

08:22.294 --> 08:24.630
- The foundation? Right.
<i>- Excellent.</i>

08:24.630 --> 08:26.632
How soon can you pull down the sign?

08:32.221 --> 08:34.223
We've identified
17 different locations

08:34.223 --> 08:37.351
where Reddington might have gone
to ground inside the containment zone.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.645
Businesses connected
through Morgana Logistics,

08:39.645 --> 08:41.480
underworld hideouts he frequented,

08:41.480 --> 08:43.315
and addresses of his known associates.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.317
Agent Zuma, you've been awfully quiet.

08:45.317 --> 08:47.861
Don't you have some ideas
from your history?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.947
What exactly are you implying,
Congressman?

08:49.947 --> 08:53.033
Over the years, there have been
a lot of keys and doors.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.369
I could draw you a map,
but I'm quite sure Raymond

08:55.369 --> 08:57.246
has changed his protocol since I've--

08:57.246 --> 08:59.122
We've tried to explain to you
that Raymond--

08:59.122 --> 09:01.583
Please, no more speeches
about his brilliant mind.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.460
We need to get rolling.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.711
Everyone, listen up.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.713
We've got a list of 17 locations.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.674
Reddington could be hiding out
in any one of them.

09:08.674 --> 09:11.176
I need you to break into teams
and work down the list.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.679
You're gonna be searching
private homes and businesses.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.180
There may be civilians on site,

09:15.180 --> 09:17.015
they may be hostile to your efforts.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.434
So I expect you to exercise caution,

09:19.434 --> 09:23.397
but I want all these places cleared
by end of day.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.237
You've got a hunch, don't you?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.283
And it's not on that list, is it?

09:36.159 --> 09:38.287
So why don't you...

09:38.287 --> 09:39.663
Because if I'm wrong,

09:40.747 --> 09:42.165
I would hate to cause this person

09:42.165 --> 09:43.917
any unnecessary distress.

09:45.294 --> 09:47.212
If Reddington's holed up with them,

09:47.212 --> 09:48.964
they must be a formidable ally?

09:48.964 --> 09:50.590
Not really.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.844
But Raymond really loves her Scotcheroos.

09:54.636 --> 09:55.637
Her what?

09:56.305 --> 09:58.473
Everyone's clear
on the timeline?

09:58.473 --> 10:00.392
It's an awfully short window.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.893
Our girl's built for speed.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.353
I don't think it'll be a problem.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.438
<i>How's she look?</i>

10:11.236 --> 10:12.863
Gorgeous as the day we bought her.

10:12.863 --> 10:13.989
All righty.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.658
Forgive me, Paula.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.201
I came to visit you,

10:18.201 --> 10:20.954
and here I am
chatting away on the phone.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.333
I assume you have a good reason.

10:25.125 --> 10:30.130
My Jellybean used to keep lines
of people waiting at the DMV

10:30.130 --> 10:32.966
just to take the girls out for a tinkle.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.676
He loved those poodles.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.511
I'm glad you brought that up.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.889
I've been pondering Glen.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.391
I've been trying to think of a fitting

10:41.391 --> 10:45.395
and more permanent way
to honor his memory.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.439
A trust or a foundation,

10:47.439 --> 10:50.108
a charitable something,
something in his name.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.653
But what would make sense for Glen?

10:55.280 --> 10:58.325
I thought of the people
he's touched in his life,

10:58.325 --> 11:03.372
his colleagues at the DMV,
his fellow bowlers.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.165
We should probably skip over

11:05.165 --> 11:07.084
what Glen loved to touch the most.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.921
But the point is,
what kind of a man was he?

11:10.921 --> 11:12.756
What did he care about?

11:12.756 --> 11:16.885
What worthwhile causes did he champion?

11:18.804 --> 11:19.888
Huh.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.307
Nothing really comes to mind.

11:22.307 --> 11:25.102
Nothing respectable, anyway.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.270
It has been an uphill battle.

11:27.270 --> 11:31.358
As you know, he had a few
passionate interests,

11:31.358 --> 11:34.027
most of them quite unmentionable,

11:34.027 --> 11:36.154
in polite company at least.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.156
<i>He gave little to charity,</i>

11:38.156 --> 11:41.243
<i>found most people
basically insufferable,</i>

11:41.243 --> 11:42.953
and vice versa.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.996
I thought, perhaps, his alma mater,

11:44.996 --> 11:49.459
but how do you honor his legacy
of catcalling coeds

11:49.459 --> 11:52.295
and dropping out his third semester?

11:52.879 --> 11:56.299
I don't know.
Maybe I'll just endow a Chair at Harvard,

11:56.299 --> 11:58.677
the School of Public Health
or something.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.721
Not what Glen would've chosen,
but who knows?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.473
Perhaps if he'd exhausted

12:03.473 --> 12:06.476
all other uses for his time and money,

12:06.476 --> 12:10.105
he might've done
something good for humanity.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.273
You never know.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.900
And Paula, I'd like
to make you a part of it.

12:13.900 --> 12:18.488
How about Honorary Member
of the selection committee?

12:18.488 --> 12:21.658
I love any excuse to throw a party!

12:22.742 --> 12:25.245
You think those Harvard snobs

12:25.245 --> 12:29.332
could handle a nice big bowl
of cheeseburger chowder?

12:38.383 --> 12:39.384
<i>Raymond,</i>

12:39.384 --> 12:43.430
you are so sweet to visit me,

12:43.430 --> 12:46.433
but you better shake a leg.

12:46.433 --> 12:50.729
It's not safe for you to be
in one place for too long.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.772
So you <i>have</i> been reading the paper.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.066
Well, you just looked
so cute in that picture,

12:55.066 --> 12:58.153
I wanted to cut it out
and put it in my scrapbook.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.531
My dear, it's been a pleasure.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.074
The greatest pleasure.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.132
Paula.

13:22.552 --> 13:23.553
Dembe?

13:24.721 --> 13:27.849
Oh, is this a new gal pal of yours?

13:27.849 --> 13:29.351
She's a cutie pie.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.019
We need to find Raymond, Paula.

13:31.853 --> 13:32.896
Oh...

13:33.980 --> 13:35.482
I'll check upstairs.

13:42.489 --> 13:46.117
Well, here, take a load off.

13:46.117 --> 13:49.829
I'd offer you some Scotcheroos,

13:49.829 --> 13:52.707
but someone ate the last one.

13:52.707 --> 13:55.377
I'm guessing that someone
was Mr. Reddington?

13:56.378 --> 13:58.171
We want to keep you
out of trouble, Paula,

13:58.171 --> 13:59.881
but you need to talk to us.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.343
Okay, fine.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.721
He came knockin' on my door,
and I took him straight to bed.

14:08.765 --> 14:13.019
Oh, take your minds
out of the gutter, you two.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.522
He didn't get any sleep last night,

14:15.522 --> 14:18.942
so I let him catch a few winks
in Jelly's old room.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.360
Now, what's wrong with that?

14:20.360 --> 14:23.905
Nothing, apart from aiding
and abetting a fugitive.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.492
He told me what to do about that.

14:27.492 --> 14:31.913
He said that
if some pushy FBI agents

14:31.913 --> 14:34.124
were to come around here,

14:34.124 --> 14:35.417
I should tell them everything.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.128
- Everything?
- That's what he said.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.171
Every little detail,

14:40.171 --> 14:42.924
so you can't charge me
with anything.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.719
The first thing I noticed,

14:45.719 --> 14:49.389
something was clearly
weighing on his mind.

14:49.389 --> 14:53.810
And, uh, and then,
he wouldn't get off the phone.

14:53.810 --> 14:54.894
Who was he calling?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.730
I don't know.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.190
If you expect
to get out of this by trading information,

14:59.190 --> 15:01.943
you actually have to give us
some information.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.404
Well, if you're gonna beat it outta me.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.034
It... It was a woman.

15:09.034 --> 15:14.998
I'm not the jealous type,
so I didn't eavesdrop, um,

15:14.998 --> 15:16.583
but her name was...

15:18.084 --> 15:20.754
Andrea something or other.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.890
I'm just about to get the key
out of the lock box.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.725
<i>Then we're
right on schedule.</i>

15:37.896 --> 15:40.398
No way!
You're a contractor.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.816
Um, we may have
a slight problem.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.694
It needs a little work,
but the bones are good.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.322
Now lemme show you that AC unit
you were asking about.

15:47.906 --> 15:50.283
There's people here.
They're taking a tour.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.243
<i>Well, you just
gotta get them to leave.</i>

15:52.243 --> 15:54.329
<i>Andrea, come on, you've got this.</i>

15:54.329 --> 15:55.622
<i>You go, girl.</i>

15:55.622 --> 15:56.748
Okay...

15:58.625 --> 16:01.169
Her name is Andrea Athens.
Raymond introduced us.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.380
<i>She's the one who found him a space</i>

16:03.380 --> 16:05.340
<i>to serve as a duplicate Post Office.</i>

16:05.340 --> 16:06.549
Wait, what duplicate--

16:06.549 --> 16:08.718
It's a long story
with a super boring ending.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.304
Based on a hunch,

16:11.304 --> 16:14.182
we thought it might be wise
to track Andrea down.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.809
<i>But we couldn't get ahold of her.</i>

16:15.809 --> 16:17.686
She wouldn't answer her phone.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.896
We tried calling her office,
but, apparently,

16:19.896 --> 16:21.022
she dropped everything

16:21.022 --> 16:23.024
to attend to a VIP client's emergency.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.109
That sounds like Raymond.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.568
Wait a minute.
What are you two getting at?

16:25.568 --> 16:27.404
You think Reddington
hired this woman to, what?

16:27.404 --> 16:28.780
Buy him a safe house?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.782
<i>That's unclear,
but before Andrea left the office,</i>

16:30.782 --> 16:33.576
she asked for her assistant
for the lockbox code

16:33.576 --> 16:35.870
at 1120 Westover Drive.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.206
That's outside
the containment zone.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.417
Does that mean Reddington
got through the barricades?

16:40.417 --> 16:42.836
If he has,
he may already be on site.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.045
We're heading there now.

16:44.045 --> 16:46.131
- Get SWAT on the line...
- Alert Metro PD...

16:49.259 --> 16:51.636
Uh, we'll scramble units
to meet you at the house.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.059
You love the house, right?

16:58.059 --> 16:59.185
Who cares about the mold?

16:59.978 --> 17:01.312
- What mold?
- Exactly!

17:01.312 --> 17:02.439
That's what I say.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.733
- What mold.
- No, what mold?

17:04.733 --> 17:06.526
You didn't tell us there was mold.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.653
There's no mold
in the disclosure.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.197
And if they didn't disclose it,
then where's the mold?

17:11.197 --> 17:14.117
- There is no mold!
- Is it the toxic kind--

17:14.117 --> 17:15.910
It isn't any kind
because it doesn't exist.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.996
I agree, mind over matter.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.080
In this market,

17:19.080 --> 17:20.415
you gotta be willing to overlook

17:20.415 --> 17:21.624
some of the little things.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.209
A little mold, who cares?

17:23.209 --> 17:24.335
Is it that black mold?

17:24.335 --> 17:26.796
Black, green, brown, whatever! Whatever!

17:26.796 --> 17:27.922
Okay, we're outta here.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.048
Mike, let's go.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.718
Thanks a lot.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.305
- I'm gonna remember this.
- Oh.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.099
Buh-bye, now!

17:38.641 --> 17:40.226
Happy hunting!

18:07.837 --> 18:10.256
Donald told me
you were a menace behind the wheel.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.717
Come on, Grandma,
we're trying to catch a fugitive.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.387
Are you sure you're ready for this?

18:16.387 --> 18:17.472
To get out of the car?

18:17.472 --> 18:18.973
Definitely.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.767
No, I mean...

18:20.767 --> 18:23.728
Well, I know we all agreed
to take Reddington down,

18:23.728 --> 18:26.231
but now that it actually might happen,

18:26.231 --> 18:28.858
are you gonna feel okay
putting him in cuffs?

18:28.858 --> 18:30.360
I'm not really sure.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.155
I guess we'll have to find out
when it happens.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.117
<i>What's your ETA?</i>

18:38.117 --> 18:39.869
Uh, we're just down the street.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.038
Backup's five minutes out.
Hold your position.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.836
You are a menace.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.796
Uh, look...

18:49.796 --> 18:50.922
<i>If Reddington's inside,</i>

18:50.922 --> 18:53.258
we don't move until
we have the house surrounded.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.051
<i>We're pretty sure he's not in the house.</i>

18:55.051 --> 18:56.427
How do you know that?

18:56.427 --> 18:59.138
Because it's on fire, sir.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.643
I don't get it.
Why would he go to all the trouble

19:03.643 --> 19:05.645
of securing a safe house
just to burn it down?

19:14.988 --> 19:17.198
Clear the way!
We've got a house going up in smoke!

19:17.198 --> 19:19.367
All right, let 'em through!
Let 'em through!

19:20.910 --> 19:22.662
What are we missing here?

19:22.662 --> 19:25.123
Well, I dunno, I mean,
maybe this is the wrong house?

19:25.123 --> 19:27.375
It could just be a bizarre coincidence.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.670
No, wait, listen.

19:33.131 --> 19:35.925
Raymond's using the fire.
That's how he's getting out.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.719
You need to alert all checkpoints.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.179
Stop any fire truck
from getting through the barricade.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.057
Reddington's likely headed
south, southeast.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.309
Know what he's driving.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.686
Agent Nixon, would you care to...

19:48.354 --> 19:50.481
Notify ground units, contact MPD.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.483
Agent Ressler, coordinate with Tactical.

19:52.483 --> 19:53.693
I want eyes in the sky.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.028
Let's find that truck!

20:11.878 --> 20:13.922
Clean it and leave it. We're gone in five.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.941
Catch you on the flip side, Chuck.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.044
It's time for an update.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.295
Where are we?

20:54.295 --> 20:57.298
Uh, same place that we were
nine hours ago.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.008
We shifted
the containment zone south.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.426
The units are going door-to-door.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.054
Still no sign of Raymond or the truck.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.263
Or Andrea Athens.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.390
She's in the wind.

21:05.390 --> 21:08.226
I don't even care about
divided loyalties anymore,

21:08.226 --> 21:11.020
I just wanna find him
so I can take a nap

21:11.020 --> 21:13.147
and [sniffs] oh, God, a shower.

21:13.147 --> 21:14.357
You gotta admit, though,

21:14.357 --> 21:16.734
that stunt with the firetruck
was pretty metal.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.569
Oh, please, we're all thinking it.

21:18.569 --> 21:19.904
Here's what
I've been thinking.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.156
I spent my rookie years chasing him,

21:22.156 --> 21:24.158
my next decade
working alongside of him,

21:24.158 --> 21:26.703
only now putting him away's
gonna end my career.

21:26.703 --> 21:29.372
What do you mean "end"?
Y-You're not retiring.

21:29.372 --> 21:30.623
No, but... I mean, come on.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.125
Even if we catch Reddington,

21:32.125 --> 21:35.294
you really think Hudson's
letting any of us walk away from this?

21:38.965 --> 21:41.592
We got it! We got the truck.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.094
Where's Agent Nixon?

21:43.094 --> 21:45.138
Oh, he's on the phone updating... someone.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.806
Get him in here.
He needs to hear this.

21:48.558 --> 21:51.310
Firetruck was abandoned... here.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.312
In a warehouse
outside Capitol Heights.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.772
Finally, something we can use.

21:54.772 --> 21:55.857
Let's scramble a team.

21:55.857 --> 21:57.400
Start canvassing for witnesses.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.610
Pull every traffic cam
in a 20-block radius.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.828
Knock, knock, knock.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.580
- Good news.
- Come in. Shut the door.

22:10.580 --> 22:11.789
We found the firetruck.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.084
- Was Reddington--
- Nah, he cleared out.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.794
But we're checking the cameras
in the area.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.880
Should ID his getaway vehicle
any minute now.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.590
Great, so that just puts us,

22:20.590 --> 22:22.842
oh, right, nine hours behind.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.886
That's nine hours for Reddington

22:24.886 --> 22:27.805
to ditch whatever getaway car
you're talking about and go

22:27.805 --> 22:28.973
pretty much anywhere in the country.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.433
Or the world, for that matter.

22:30.433 --> 22:33.061
Hey, look, I'm just here
to help you catch your guy.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.729
If you don't like the way
I'm doing things--

22:34.729 --> 22:36.439
It's not you. It's them.

22:36.439 --> 22:38.066
What do think
they're doing out there?

22:39.734 --> 22:42.945
We should've taken Reddington
at that airfield two days ago.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.572
But he disappears just as we arrived.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.240
Then we lock down an entire district,

22:46.240 --> 22:48.367
and he slips past us at the barricade.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.495
How many times do we have
to fail before we admit

22:50.495 --> 22:52.997
there's a reason
he's always one step ahead?

22:52.997 --> 22:54.457
He's good at what he does.

22:54.457 --> 22:55.666
He's been doing it for decades.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.251
But this time it's different, right?

22:57.251 --> 22:59.504
'Cause now we've got his team
helping us...

23:00.463 --> 23:02.799
Unless it's not <i>us</i> they're helping.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.218
They're the Reddington Task Force.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.886
It's in their goddamn name.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.597
If you're right,

23:09.597 --> 23:11.182
we're gonna nail them to the wall.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.815
Where's Nixon going?

23:18.815 --> 23:20.149
Who knows?

23:20.149 --> 23:22.110
Why don't we go ahead
and review what we've got?

23:22.110 --> 23:23.736
Unfortunately, we couldn't recover

23:23.736 --> 23:25.655
any of the security footage of Reddington

23:25.655 --> 23:27.865
or his crew exiting the warehouse.

23:27.865 --> 23:30.243
Our field photographer took these.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.080
What about this?

23:34.080 --> 23:37.041
It's a red-light camera,
activates when you go through the light.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.335
I guess there's some laws
that Reddington does obey.

23:39.335 --> 23:42.547
But there are other CCTV cameras
in the surrounding neighborhood.

23:42.547 --> 23:44.799
We're isolating every car
that passed by

23:44.799 --> 23:46.008
in the hours after the fire.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.718
We're up to 30 vehicles and counting.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.637
Reddington could be in any one of them.

23:49.637 --> 23:50.972
I'll talk to Agent Nixon,

23:50.972 --> 23:53.933
see if he can get some help
running facial recognition and tracking.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.184
After ten hours, we're gonna have to

23:55.184 --> 23:56.769
comb through a lot of footage

23:56.769 --> 23:58.980
to trace the trajectory of his car.

23:59.856 --> 24:01.858
He breached the barricade here.

24:01.858 --> 24:04.026
He abandoned his truck here.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.114
He's heading east.

24:11.242 --> 24:14.620
A lifetime ago at a party
on the Hicacos Peninsula,

24:14.620 --> 24:16.664
Raymond exchanged some sweet nothings

24:16.664 --> 24:18.249
with the wife of our host.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.709
He was made to understand

24:19.709 --> 24:21.544
that his life would be worth nothing,

24:21.544 --> 24:23.129
or his death
would be worth too much,

24:23.129 --> 24:25.381
if he spent another night in Varadero.

24:25.381 --> 24:29.010
So we stole our host's speedboat
and set out for Havana.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.596
That's when he told me,

24:31.596 --> 24:34.891
"In times of trouble
you go one of two ways,

24:34.891 --> 24:37.393
up in the sky or out to sea."

24:37.393 --> 24:39.812
Now we know he didn't go up,
not without his jet.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.064
But what about out?

24:54.243 --> 24:55.286
Congratulations.

24:56.037 --> 24:58.247
You're not the only one
who's paranoid anymore.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.041
It's not paranoia if it's real.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.334
This real enough for you?

25:01.334 --> 25:04.170
I pulled phone records for all
outgoing calls from this building,

25:04.170 --> 25:06.881
- the day we lost Reddington on the tarmac.
- Mmm-hmm?

25:06.881 --> 25:09.133
Minutes after we learned
the location of the jet,

25:09.133 --> 25:10.968
there was a ten-second call
to a burner phone

25:10.968 --> 25:13.221
that pinged to a tower on highway 50,

25:13.221 --> 25:14.889
right down the road from the airfield.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.308
- Reddington's burner phone.
- You were right.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.101
Someone <i>did</i> call to warn him.

25:21.646 --> 25:22.647
Who was it?

25:25.983 --> 25:27.818
Operating off of Dembe's theory,

25:27.818 --> 25:29.904
we ran down any ships
with ties to Morgana.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.989
We figured that Reddington
would want to push off

25:31.989 --> 25:33.866
somewhere nearby with minimal security.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.410
Bluefish Pier is closest,
but it's popular with tourists

25:36.410 --> 25:39.163
which means a lot of eyeballs
with nothing better to do

25:39.163 --> 25:41.249
than call the FBI tip line.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.501
Can't ya just see
Red photobombing a selfie?

25:43.501 --> 25:45.503
It's like, "Did you catch
a fish on vacation?"

25:45.503 --> 25:46.796
"No, no. I caught a fugitive."

25:48.839 --> 25:50.633
Anyway, the second one,
Finley's Landing,

25:50.633 --> 25:52.593
it's just a bunch of rich boys
and their toys,

25:52.593 --> 25:54.053
yachts, sailboats, that kind of thing.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.930
Wait... Tillman's Wharf.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.098
What?

25:57.098 --> 25:58.599
Raymond used to have an interest

25:58.599 --> 26:00.559
in some commercial
fishing boats docked there.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.353
He shielded most of his investments

26:02.353 --> 26:04.480
behind various shell companies,

26:04.480 --> 26:08.067
but he enjoyed the perks of
supplying the freshest seafood

26:08.067 --> 26:10.444
to restaurants and markets
around the city.

26:10.444 --> 26:12.613
You're thinking that fleet
had a secondary purpose?

26:12.613 --> 26:15.574
Why risk a traffic stop on land
when you can jump on a boat

26:15.574 --> 26:17.618
and be in open water within a few hours?

26:17.618 --> 26:18.703
It's a good hunch.

26:18.703 --> 26:20.037
Let's gear up and head down--

26:20.037 --> 26:22.081
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.333
That's him.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.795
What is this?
What are you doing?

26:28.212 --> 26:29.338
Take him to interrogation.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.174
Now you're questioning
your own people?

26:32.174 --> 26:33.801
What kind of an outfit are you running?

26:33.801 --> 26:35.177
I wouldn't worry about it.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.139
As you said, Agent Ishwood
doesn't report to you.

26:38.848 --> 26:40.516
Whatever he's being questioned about,

26:40.516 --> 26:42.643
it should be conducted
by either you or me.

26:43.185 --> 26:45.021
And right now, we don't have
the time to waste.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.772
Agent Zuma has a credible lead.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.566
We need to get
to Tillman's Wharf now.

26:48.566 --> 26:50.318
All right, Zuma, you come with me.

26:50.318 --> 26:51.902
You can explain on the way.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.279
The rest of you stay put.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.156
And Mr. Cooper, if you'd like to sit in

26:55.156 --> 26:58.284
on the conversation between
Agent Ishwood and Congressman Hudson,

26:58.284 --> 26:59.618
please, feel free.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.761
Your wife completed
a law degree two years ago?

27:16.761 --> 27:18.012
Yes, sir.

27:18.012 --> 27:20.348
You have a mortgage
and two kids in private school.

27:20.348 --> 27:21.599
How'd you pay tuition?

27:22.767 --> 27:24.060
We borrowed from her brother.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.521
Marcus.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.399
Marcus Kennedy.

27:33.694 --> 27:34.945
Something wrong, Agent Ishwood?

27:36.614 --> 27:37.823
No, sir. I just... I--

27:37.823 --> 27:38.991
I'll tell you what's wrong,

27:38.991 --> 27:40.659
the three of us wasting time in this room

27:40.659 --> 27:43.788
while the world's most wanted man
gets further away by the minute.

27:43.788 --> 27:46.082
Agent Ishwood is a ten-year
veteran of the Bureau

27:46.082 --> 27:47.583
with a sterling record.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.543
So if you're building to a point,
Mr. Hudson,

27:49.543 --> 27:51.045
I suggest you make it now.

27:54.507 --> 27:57.426
Fourteen minutes before
our response teams arrived

27:57.426 --> 27:59.512
at the airfield where
we tracked Reddington's jet,

27:59.512 --> 28:00.846
a call was made from your phone

28:00.846 --> 28:02.848
to a burner at the airfield.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.768
So I'd say we're here

28:05.768 --> 28:07.895
to figure out why Agent Ishwood

28:07.895 --> 28:09.688
decided to betray his country.

28:11.315 --> 28:13.109
That number corresponds
to the cell phone

28:13.109 --> 28:15.152
taken from you earlier today,
does it not?

28:15.152 --> 28:18.114
Yes, sir,
but I didn't make that call.

28:20.574 --> 28:21.742
I don't believe you.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.411
Tell me about your first year
with the Bureau.

28:23.411 --> 28:25.413
- Mr. Cooper, please--
- You don't have to believe him.

28:25.413 --> 28:27.498
We have surveillance devices
all over this facility.

28:27.498 --> 28:30.334
If Agent Ishwood did make that call,
we'll see it.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.294
And you won't.

28:35.131 --> 28:36.465
Sir.

28:39.677 --> 28:40.886
Lead the way.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.023
Special Agent Zuma, FBI.

28:53.023 --> 28:54.942
This is Special Agent Nixon.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.111
We need the location
of these five vessels.

28:59.321 --> 29:00.906
I'm afraid it's urgent.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.992
Okay. Let me check the logs.

29:04.660 --> 29:08.038
That's Agent Ishwood
at the exact moment the call was made.

29:08.622 --> 29:10.291
Doesn't appear to be
on his phone to me.

29:10.291 --> 29:12.126
So either he gave the phone
to someone

29:12.126 --> 29:13.586
or someone took it from him.

29:13.586 --> 29:14.670
Do you mind?

29:17.173 --> 29:19.300
First three on your list
set out last month.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.427
And, uh, the <i>Amy Jo's</i>
been in dry dock

29:21.427 --> 29:22.553
for the last two weeks.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.221
What about <i>The Great Shirley?</i>

29:30.603 --> 29:33.355
Yeah.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.817
- Huh.
- What is it?

29:36.817 --> 29:38.319
<i>Great Shirley</i> got in yesterday.

29:38.319 --> 29:40.571
She was supposed to go to
dry dock for some engine work,

29:40.571 --> 29:42.865
but looks like they resupplied last night

29:42.865 --> 29:44.366
and headed right back out.

29:49.497 --> 29:52.124
Raymond left on a commercial
fishing boat late last night.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.168
- Are you sure he was on it?
<i>- Yes.</i>

29:54.168 --> 29:56.212
Call Coast Guard Base Portsmouth.

29:56.212 --> 29:57.630
We need them to use every vessel

29:57.630 --> 29:59.673
they have to track them on radar.

30:00.758 --> 30:01.759
Oh, my God!

30:03.052 --> 30:05.429
Put the phone down
and put your hands on your head.

30:06.263 --> 30:07.681
- Now.
- <i>Dembe?</i>

30:10.100 --> 30:11.602
I'm telling you, he's on that boat.

30:11.602 --> 30:13.437
Herbie, try and get Dembe
back on the line.

30:13.437 --> 30:16.357
Somebody get me the Commander
of the Coast Guard's fifth district.

30:16.357 --> 30:18.442
Hold on a minute, Mr. Ressler.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.903
We won't be taking
any more cues from Agent Zuma.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.863
What? We need to find that boat.

30:22.863 --> 30:26.450
No, we don't because Raymond Reddington
is nowhere near that vessel.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.452
- I understand your hesitation...
- Hesitation?

30:28.452 --> 30:30.454
...but if we have a lead,
we need to pursue it.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.623
I don't know what this is,
but Agent Zuma just--

30:32.623 --> 30:34.166
Dembe Zuma's under arrest.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.086
On what charge?

30:37.795 --> 30:39.171
Aiding and abetting a fugitive.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.717
At 3:55 p.m. just before our raid

30:43.717 --> 30:45.844
on Reddington's jet at the airfield,

30:45.844 --> 30:47.972
a call was placed
from Agent Ishwood's phone

30:47.972 --> 30:49.765
to a cell phone in the vicinity.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.268
We believe that phone belonged
to Raymond Reddington.

30:52.268 --> 30:54.562
<i>Only Agent Ishwood didn't make that call,</i>

30:54.562 --> 30:56.230
<i>Zuma did.</i>

30:58.107 --> 31:00.693
Here is Agent Ishwood
at the time of the call.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.404
And here is Agent Zuma

31:03.404 --> 31:06.073
90 seconds
after the call ended.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.951
He was clever enough to avoid
taking the phone on camera...

31:08.951 --> 31:10.744
But here he is putting it back.

31:13.247 --> 31:14.957
Hope he washed his hands.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.170
I'm telling you, he's on that boat.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.131
If we don't get him now,
we never will.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.224
Nice truck.

31:33.851 --> 31:34.852
Where's the boat?

31:35.519 --> 31:36.520
We sunk it.

31:40.107 --> 31:41.233
You smell like fish.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.651
Crab, actually.

31:44.111 --> 31:46.030
We'll roll down the windows.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.356
He's definitely slipping something

32:20.356 --> 32:21.482
into Ishwood's pocket,

32:21.482 --> 32:23.192
but maybe it's not a phone.
Maybe it's

32:24.109 --> 32:26.528
a small, phone-shaped thing.

32:26.528 --> 32:27.988
Herbie, just could you...

32:27.988 --> 32:29.907
Sorry.

32:29.907 --> 32:34.078
Look, I've grown quite fond
of Dembe, truly,

32:34.078 --> 32:35.704
but should we really be that surprised?

32:35.704 --> 32:38.415
I mean, he spent decades
with Reddington.

32:38.415 --> 32:42.628
It couldn't have been easy to
sever that kind of connection.

32:42.628 --> 32:46.048
No one was more suspect of Dembe
joining the FBI than me,

32:46.048 --> 32:48.008
but he's proven himself
time and time again

32:48.008 --> 32:51.220
to be a dedicated,
thorough, honest agent.

32:51.220 --> 32:54.098
Who called his best friend to
keep him from a life in prison.

32:54.098 --> 32:57.101
You sure you wouldn't have done the same
if the roles were reversed?

32:57.101 --> 32:58.477
I'm not.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.396
I wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for Red.

33:00.396 --> 33:01.522
I love him.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.817
I mean, not as much
as he loves Holly, my wife,

33:04.817 --> 33:07.945
which I guess I've always been
strangely comfortable with.

33:08.612 --> 33:11.532
But the point is, everything
about chasing him feels wrong,

33:11.532 --> 33:13.951
and I haven't known him
half as long as Dembe.

33:14.201 --> 33:15.994
What I can't figure out, though,

33:15.994 --> 33:18.122
is that if Dembe did warn Reddington,

33:18.122 --> 33:19.748
why take us
to the real-estate agent?

33:19.748 --> 33:21.542
Why lead us to the wharf?

33:43.021 --> 33:44.648
He say anything on the way over?

33:44.648 --> 33:46.024
- Not a word.
- All right.

33:48.152 --> 33:50.279
Excuse me. I need to speak
with Agent Zuma.

33:50.821 --> 33:53.449
Given the circumstances,
I don't think that'd be appropriate.

33:53.449 --> 33:55.826
I appreciate the counsel,
but Agent Zuma reports to me.

33:55.826 --> 33:58.370
If you have a problem with me
speaking with one of my people,

33:58.370 --> 34:00.122
you can take it up
with the Attorney General.

34:00.122 --> 34:01.206
Stand aside.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.463
<i>Traffic is
slowed down on Route 264</i>

34:07.463 --> 34:09.381
<i>with a tractor trailer
off on the shoulder.</i>

34:09.381 --> 34:11.717
<i>In other news,
police have a suspect in custody</i>

34:11.717 --> 34:13.969
<i>after a string of burglaries
targeting mobile homes</i>

34:13.969 --> 34:15.888
<i>outside of Fairfield, and a...</i>

34:15.888 --> 34:17.848
At least I'm not on the news
down here.

34:17.848 --> 34:20.100
Mmm. The seaplane is fueled.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.519
You'll need to leave as soon
as we arrive.

34:22.519 --> 34:25.147
It'll be nice to get out of the country.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.815
Where are you off to next?

34:26.815 --> 34:29.359
A meeting outside Bogota.

34:29.359 --> 34:30.444
Will I see you?

34:30.444 --> 34:31.653
When it's safe.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.240
With any luck,
we'll be back on the mountain

34:35.240 --> 34:37.326
by the start of the rainy season.

34:38.452 --> 34:39.620
We'll see.

34:47.628 --> 34:49.004
Your people at the wharf.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.881
Mary was questioned by the FBI.

34:56.929 --> 34:57.930
What is it?

34:59.807 --> 35:01.725
Dembe was taken away in handcuffs.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.523
It's not your fault, Raymond.

35:09.024 --> 35:10.651
You didn't ask him to interfere.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.697
I know.

35:28.585 --> 35:30.379
Coast Guard just called off the search.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.799
The boat's vanished.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.135
Then he's gone.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.054
Maybe. But not because of you.

35:40.222 --> 35:41.682
I want you to know, Dembe,
you're gonna have

35:41.682 --> 35:44.226
my full support in disputing
these accusations.

35:44.226 --> 35:45.811
Whatever that tape suggests--

35:45.811 --> 35:47.980
I won't be fighting any charges.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.524
I stole Agent Ishwood's phone,

35:50.524 --> 35:52.276
and I warned Raymond about the raid.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.153
Why, Dembe?

35:55.153 --> 35:57.406
If Congressman Hudson and Agent Nixon

35:57.406 --> 35:58.949
had cornered him on the airfield,

35:58.949 --> 36:01.326
Raymond would have
refused to surrender

36:01.326 --> 36:04.246
and he and any number of agents
would have been killed.

36:04.246 --> 36:05.914
You were trying to save lives.

36:05.914 --> 36:07.916
And you spent the last 48 hours

36:07.916 --> 36:10.586
trying to find Reddington
and bring him in safely.

36:10.586 --> 36:12.421
If we explain that
to the Attorney General--

36:12.421 --> 36:13.964
It won't matter.

36:13.964 --> 36:15.716
Raymond is gone.

36:15.716 --> 36:18.719
And someone on this Task Force
will be held accountable.

36:18.719 --> 36:19.928
It should be me.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.014
That's absurd.

36:22.014 --> 36:24.641
Every member of this team
bears responsibility

36:24.641 --> 36:26.351
for what we've done here.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.604
If you think I'm gonna let you
take the hit--

36:28.604 --> 36:30.063
We are not the same, Harold.

36:30.564 --> 36:33.066
You operated in a legal gray area.

36:34.318 --> 36:36.612
I spent over two decades
at the right hand

36:36.612 --> 36:38.196
of the world's greatest criminal.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.073
You're not that man anymore.

36:40.073 --> 36:41.366
No, I'm not.

36:41.366 --> 36:44.036
And I'm grateful for my time
on the Task Force, but--

36:45.245 --> 36:47.247
Mr. Cooper,
please step away from the table.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.207
- What's going on here?
- Put it on.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.375
I did
what you suggested.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.586
The Attorney General agrees
that Agent Zuma should be

36:52.586 --> 36:55.047
transferred to FBI headquarters
for further questioning.

36:56.506 --> 36:57.507
I don't trust you.

36:57.507 --> 36:58.800
I don't trust him.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.886
And I certainly don't trust this place.

37:01.929 --> 37:04.640
You won't be pulling rank
to speak to our suspect again.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.728
Let's go.

37:21.198 --> 37:23.283
Where do you think you're going,
Agent Ressler?

37:23.283 --> 37:24.618
Oh, with you.

37:24.618 --> 37:27.287
I intend to be present
for Agent Zuma's questioning.

37:27.287 --> 37:28.497
If you don't like it, well,

37:28.497 --> 37:30.207
you can slap some cuffs
on me, as well.

38:00.445 --> 38:01.780
No, no, I won't make the vote.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.241
Tell the whip
I'll explain when I can.

38:04.241 --> 38:05.701
Believe me, this is more important.

38:07.411 --> 38:09.913
You know, I almost
have to hand it to him.

38:09.913 --> 38:12.165
Getting his man inside the FBI...

38:12.165 --> 38:13.250
It's ballsy.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.127
Whatever you may think, Congressman,

38:15.127 --> 38:17.254
I didn't join the Task Force
for Raymond.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.673

39:51.890 --> 39:53.016
It's not what you think.

39:53.016 --> 39:54.518

39:55.769 --> 39:57.604
Everyone, calm down.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.648

40:02.400 --> 40:03.819

40:03.819 --> 40:07.239

Congressman Hudson, please.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.492

40:10.492 --> 40:12.994
No is going to hurt you.
Please, lower your weapon.

You're his guy.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.456
