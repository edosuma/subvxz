WEBVTT

00:03.469 --> 00:06.234
It's Betty. Can we talk?

00:08.108 --> 00:09.166
Hi.

00:11.544 --> 00:14.741
I'm doing crunches.
You got the money or not?

00:14.981 --> 00:17.950
Yes. Well, no. Some. But...

00:18.351 --> 00:20.683
Look, I think if you let me explain,

00:20.720 --> 00:23.450
you'd be a lot more open
to working this out.

00:23.490 --> 00:27.483
I've had an awful, awful week, and...
Please, just hear me out.

00:27.927 --> 00:29.792
Fine. Move your face.

00:34.401 --> 00:36.869
I finished Audrey Hepburn's
biography last night

00:36.903 --> 00:38.131
and it totally inspired me.

00:38.171 --> 00:39.729
Ugh. Audrey Hepburn, she's so boring.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.331
<i>I hated Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

00:41.374 --> 00:43.171
But if you tell
one gay person I said that,

00:43.209 --> 00:45.404
- I will deny it. I will.
- I promise.

00:45.445 --> 00:49.211
Anyway, Audrey basically gave up her
stardom to go and do good in the world,

00:49.249 --> 00:52.013
and it made me think.
I'm an editor now.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.076
Really?

00:53.119 --> 00:56.486
And I'm finally in a position
to tell stories like that.

00:56.523 --> 01:00.482
Stories about people who do
inspiring and selfless things.

01:00.527 --> 01:02.757
Well, here's your next assignment
from the powers that be.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.093
Inspiring?

01:04.129 --> 01:06.098
"The most comfortable stiletto. "

01:06.132 --> 01:10.501
Betty Suarez, keeping the dream alive
for hookers with hammer toe.

01:16.643 --> 01:19.840
I don't think I'll ever get tired
of those lips.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.615
Willie, don't you think
we're kidding ourselves here?

01:23.650 --> 01:26.346
- Meaning?
- Meaning you can't go on like this.

01:26.386 --> 01:29.014
Giving up an actual life
in the world to visit me

01:29.055 --> 01:32.547
here in this godforsaken place.
I'm gonna be in here for years.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.082
That's no life for you.

01:34.127 --> 01:35.219
Please.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.890
I've done much worse for much longer
and gotten much less out of it.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.901
I'm serious.
You deserve more than this.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.529
Connor, I'm happy. Now, stop it.

01:50.009 --> 01:52.204
Thirty minutes. That's it.

01:57.650 --> 02:00.619
I can't believe how many ads we lost
while Hartley was in charge.

02:00.653 --> 02:03.053
Can we just talk a little more
about how much I hated him?

02:03.089 --> 02:04.215
Maybe later.

02:04.257 --> 02:06.122
So, when are we shaving the beard,
do you think?

02:06.159 --> 02:08.127
- We are not. I like it.
- Hmm.

02:08.527 --> 02:10.291
- We'll revisit.
- Yeah.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.893
Daniel, I need Marc and
you're just gonna have to deal with it.

02:13.933 --> 02:17.767
Well, since you asked so sweetly,
how could I possibly say... No.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.398
I'm sorry, I'm working like
an eight-year-old seamstress here,

02:20.440 --> 02:22.340
trying to turn this magazine around.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.172
I don't have time to replace him now.

02:24.210 --> 02:28.010
Hmm. Says the woman who strolls in
at... Oh, look at that, 11:00.

02:28.715 --> 02:31.479
I was visiting my sick aunt in Jersey.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.416
You feel good about that crack now?

02:34.454 --> 02:36.319
Point being, you stole Marc from me.

02:36.356 --> 02:37.721
The least you could do
is share him with me.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.315
Just for a while.

02:39.359 --> 02:41.884
And how does Marc feel about that?

02:42.695 --> 02:46.563
It's funny how you pretend
like I have any say in it at all.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.394
Fine. But just for a while.

02:51.070 --> 02:54.471
Will there be extra compensation
for this extra work?

02:54.707 --> 02:57.767
I no longer feel betrayed by you.
That's compensation enough.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.175
Get up.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.942
Yeah,
what have you been up to?

03:01.981 --> 03:05.348
Well, I've been...
You know, work is kind of slow.

03:06.052 --> 03:08.020
- Sorry I'm late.
Do more charity work.

03:08.054 --> 03:10.215
Charity work?
What charity work?

03:10.256 --> 03:13.020
I've been building houses
for Happy Homes.

03:13.059 --> 03:15.323
Yeah, a group of us go in
and we build them

03:15.361 --> 03:17.989
with the people who are actually
gonna be living in them.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.262
It's a great experience.
Reminds me to be grateful.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.269
You're so good. I hate you.

03:23.303 --> 03:24.531
Me, too.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.268
Sorry. I was eavesdropping.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.971
I don't hate you, I love you.

03:32.011 --> 03:33.035
Actually, I don't know you,

03:33.079 --> 03:36.276
but I'm just grateful
that you do what you do.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.275
There you go.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.479
See, that's what I want to be
writing about.

03:40.520 --> 03:44.047
Stuff like that, people like that
who do things like that.

03:44.090 --> 03:46.524
I'm sure I'll find a way to turn
"The Most Comfortable Stiletto"

03:46.559 --> 03:47.992
into something a little more me,

03:48.027 --> 03:49.289
but I have no idea
what that's gonna be.

03:49.329 --> 03:51.297
But, anyway, enough.
How was your morning?

03:51.331 --> 03:52.821
Well, first yoga and a movie,

03:52.865 --> 03:55.299
then I'm gonna pick a paint color
for my walls.

03:55.335 --> 03:57.565
Swiss mocha or eggnog.

03:57.604 --> 04:00.505
<i>See? You leaving Mode
was really good for us,</i>

04:00.540 --> 04:02.132
because, before,
I would have already known that,

04:02.175 --> 04:05.576
but now I'm like, "Ooh, what color
is he gonna choose?"

04:05.612 --> 04:06.977
Oops.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

04:19.192 --> 04:20.454
And then it hit me.

04:20.493 --> 04:24.361
Why don't I write a story called
"Walk a Mile in Her Shoes?"

04:24.397 --> 04:26.228
I can feature a specific shoe,

04:26.266 --> 04:29.292
and then attach a personal story
of an inspiring woman

04:29.335 --> 04:31.326
who wears that shoe in her daily life.

04:31.371 --> 04:35.569
Like a woman who builds houses
for the poor in her work boot,

04:35.608 --> 04:40.068
or a charitable executive
and her designer heels.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.711
I mean, comfortable stiletto.

04:43.716 --> 04:46.184
Who's really gonna believe that
anyway, right?

04:47.320 --> 04:50.255
What was wrong with the assignment
you were given, Betty?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.723
Back up.

04:54.260 --> 04:58.390
Nothing.
I just thought that it was a little light

04:58.765 --> 05:00.426
and I could put it in my own voice.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.024
You're not paid for your voice.

05:02.068 --> 05:05.663
You're paid to imitate mine.
I chose that story for you.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.696
Sorry. I just thought that...

05:07.740 --> 05:11.369
You do make a good point.
The story does need something.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.602
A new writer. You can go.

05:15.014 --> 05:19.144
That's right, Betty, you get nothing.
Everyone, watch Betty leave.

05:30.263 --> 05:34.199
That's it? Your boss was mean to you?

05:34.967 --> 05:36.958
That's your awful week?

05:39.639 --> 05:41.266
Let me finish.

05:56.289 --> 06:00.658
Hilda, I'm freaking out.
I made Wilhelmina really, really mad.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.526
What happened?
Hey, chew over the bowl, huh?

06:03.563 --> 06:05.997
She took away my piece. What do I do?

06:06.032 --> 06:09.160
Do I go back and apologize
and beg for it back?

06:09.469 --> 06:11.767
Tell her I'm coming over
and I'm pregnant

06:11.804 --> 06:14.898
and bloated and she better do
whatever you tell her to do.

06:14.941 --> 06:17.671
<i>Seeing as that whole image
terrifies me,</i>

06:18.077 --> 06:20.443
I think I'm just gonna ask for it back.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.175
All right, well, that's your call.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.080
Hey, what did I just say?

06:24.117 --> 06:27.211
Okay, I'm going now,
and be nice to Bobby.

06:27.253 --> 06:28.515
Okay, bye.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.846
My father is mad enough
that you got me pregnant,

06:30.890 --> 06:32.619
you can't afford to wreck his house.

06:32.658 --> 06:33.818
All right, it was an accident.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.988
We can't afford any more accidents
around here.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.290
Look, it's a little spaghetti
on an old rug.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.994
- I'll clean it up myself. All right?
- Oh, no, no, I will clean it up,

06:42.034 --> 06:43.729
because that is who I am around here.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.431
I am the cleaner-upper person.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.302
I cleaned up after Justin this morning,

06:47.340 --> 06:48.602
I will clean up after you now

06:48.641 --> 06:51.405
and I will be cleaning up after this baby
for the next 50 years.

06:51.444 --> 06:54.538
- Now you're mad at the baby.
- No, I just...

06:54.947 --> 06:57.074
I'm sorry.

06:57.116 --> 07:00.313
I just wanted to take a shower
and I haven't had time,

07:00.353 --> 07:02.150
and now I'm pregnant
and I will never have time

07:02.188 --> 07:04.349
to take a shower ever again.

07:04.390 --> 07:07.052
Sweetie, come on, stop.
What's stopping you from...

07:07.093 --> 07:09.027
You spilled on the rug.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.624
Excuse me, Wilhelmina?

07:15.668 --> 07:17.829
You have 30 seconds. Go.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.905
Okay, I'm sorry.

07:19.939 --> 07:23.602
Really, really sorry about
what happened in the pitch meeting.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.508
I didn't mean to offend you at all.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.410
- Ten.
- Wow. That was 20 seconds?

07:27.447 --> 07:30.177
Really? Is that how you want
to use the rest of your time?

07:30.216 --> 07:31.581
No, right. Again, I'm sorry.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.744
I'm grateful to have the job at all,
I meant no disrespect,

07:33.786 --> 07:37.847
I know my place here and I will write
a great piece in your voice, I promise.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.586
Save the world on your own time, Betty.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.423
You write whatever fluff piece I give you

07:42.462 --> 07:45.158
and then maybe
I'll give you something better.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.826
- Understand?
- Yes. A hundred percent.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.034
I did like the title of your piece.

07:53.072 --> 07:55.302
"Walk a Mile in Her Shoes. "

07:55.341 --> 07:58.469
So, let's do that.
Let's have you walk a mile

08:00.546 --> 08:01.877
in these.

08:03.716 --> 08:06.310
And write about
how comfortable they are.

08:06.352 --> 08:08.183
Oh, and, Betty,
I know what those soles look like

08:08.221 --> 08:09.586
with a half-mile on them,

08:09.622 --> 08:13.251
and I know what they look like
with a whole mile on them.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.664
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?
Seriously?

08:31.911 --> 08:33.003
- Betty. What the...
- Daniel.

08:33.044 --> 08:35.376
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm gonna die.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.405
Wilhelmina's making me write
a first-person piece

08:37.450 --> 08:39.111
on how comfortable these heels are.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.812
What? Do you want me to talk to her?

08:40.852 --> 08:42.878
No. I'm trying to pay my dues

08:42.922 --> 08:44.947
so she'll give me
something better to write.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.253
Will you walk with me please?

08:46.292 --> 08:47.759
Okay, but we have to walk fast.

08:47.793 --> 08:49.124
Marc forgot to book my car again.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.356
I'm literally running
to an appointment at Coach.

08:51.397 --> 08:53.262
He's really been messing up a lot lately.

08:53.299 --> 08:56.462
Marc? Really?
Marc's an amazing assistant.

08:56.502 --> 08:59.403
And no offense, Daniel,
but you're not the best communicator.

08:59.438 --> 09:02.271
What? That's... Betty, but...
No... What?

09:02.775 --> 09:06.472
See? I mean, I understood that,
but I've worked with you for a long time.

09:06.512 --> 09:08.844
All right, I guess, maybe.
All right, I've got to go left here.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.940
Okay, just peel off gently.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.745
Oh, no, no.

09:19.525 --> 09:21.015
Oh.

09:22.628 --> 09:23.993
I can never tell with you, Betty.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.590
Is this an accessory you're working,
or did you actually hurt yourself?

09:26.632 --> 09:29.123
I actually fell. Into traffic.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.634
Wow. A mile and a quarter.

09:37.677 --> 09:39.645
I was ten blocks away
from St. Vincent's,

09:39.679 --> 09:41.112
so I just kept going.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.945
And fortunately it was a long wait,
so I could write my piece.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.781
I emailed you 200 words
from the hospital.

09:46.819 --> 09:48.184
Fine. You may have another piece.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.225
Supposed to make
your skin feel as soft

09:54.260 --> 09:56.922
as a baby's ass in two days.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.892
See you Thursday.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.600
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.502
Was that really moisturizer?

10:10.543 --> 10:12.738
By Ukrainian standards, yes.

10:12.979 --> 10:16.039
Connor put me
in the worst mood this morning.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.812
He's pushing me away.
He thinks he's doing it for me.

10:18.851 --> 10:21.979
He suggests that I go out
and live my life.

10:25.424 --> 10:26.686
What?

10:26.726 --> 10:27.852
What are you doing with your face?

10:27.893 --> 10:30.123
You really are in love with him.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.459
Of course,

10:31.497 --> 10:33.624
but that's no reason
to feel things for me.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.601
You have to find a way to tell him
that you're not going away.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.934
Exactly. But how can I prove to him

10:38.971 --> 10:40.802
that I'm as committed
to this relationship

10:40.840 --> 10:43.400
as he is to that prison sentence?

10:47.213 --> 10:48.271
I think I've got it.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.714
Oh, my God. You're not gonna
break him out of jail, are you?

10:50.750 --> 10:51.978
No.

10:52.518 --> 10:54.247
Just the opposite.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.566
Darling, as happy as I am to see you,

11:10.603 --> 11:12.434
shouldn't you be out
on the town right now,

11:12.471 --> 11:15.065
trading barbs
with some irritating socialite?

11:15.107 --> 11:19.203
Oh, you're irritating enough,
especially when you talk like that.

11:19.245 --> 11:20.303
Now listen to me.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.474
I know you're worried about me,
which is touching,

11:23.516 --> 11:25.347
but I've had enough.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.213
- What the...
- Just open it.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.060
We're getting married.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.095
Willie, this is crazy.

11:42.134 --> 11:46.127
I mean, I love you for trying this,
but I'm still locked up in here.

11:46.172 --> 11:48.299
And marriage is my way of showing you

11:48.340 --> 11:50.467
I'm willing to be as locked up
as you are.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.136
Connor, I love you,

11:52.178 --> 11:55.636
and I'm not gonna lose you
just because you're in prison.

11:55.681 --> 11:57.148
- So we're doing this.
- Willie, please.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.549
You can say yes now
or you can say yes later,

11:59.585 --> 12:03.487
but I will come back every day
until I get the answer I want.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.486
So I'll ask again.

12:06.692 --> 12:09.525
Will you marry me?

12:20.005 --> 12:23.771
Yes. You pushy, remarkable woman.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.504
I will marry you.

12:31.117 --> 12:32.243
You know, I probably shouldn't say this,

12:32.284 --> 12:35.617
but I met the perfect person
for that story you wanted to do.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.645
- The one about the shoes?
- Don't tell her that.

12:37.690 --> 12:38.714
Yes, tell me.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.056
Okay, well, you know how my family
gives money to that organization

12:41.093 --> 12:43.220
- that does relief work in Botswana?
- Aw!

12:43.262 --> 12:45.822
Anyway, I met one of the women
that actually does the work.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.095
Very cool, very smart,
and a grandmother.

12:48.134 --> 12:49.226
She's in town for one more week

12:49.268 --> 12:51.031
before she goes back
to Africa for another tour,

12:51.070 --> 12:52.537
and she had on these funky sandals

12:52.571 --> 12:54.163
that would have been perfect
for the shoe angle.

12:54.206 --> 12:55.503
- What did I just say?
What?

12:55.541 --> 12:56.667
She wanted me to tell her.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.267
She doesn't know what she needs.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.141
Now I just want to write it even more.

13:00.179 --> 13:01.578
What is wrong with Wilhelmina?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.344
Why can't she see how good
of a piece it could be?

13:04.383 --> 13:06.248
You know what you should do?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.753
Start your own blog. Yeah, like that...

13:08.788 --> 13:10.915
What's her name? Huffington.
Only not so newsy.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.924
Actually, a blog is a great idea.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.186
Then you could write
whatever you want

13:14.226 --> 13:15.250
and just publish it yourself.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.524
Well, yeah,
but I don't know how to start a blog.

13:17.563 --> 13:18.723
- I could help you.
- Come on.

13:18.764 --> 13:21.324
This could be the first step
in creating your own magazine.

13:21.367 --> 13:24.825
Or a book deal. Or a movie.

13:24.870 --> 13:27.498
Okay, I wasn't so sure
when you said "blog,"

13:27.540 --> 13:30.270
but now we're talking movies, so I'm in.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.834
Guys, come on.
Would anyone even read it?

13:32.878 --> 13:34.539
There are so many blogs out there.

13:34.580 --> 13:35.740
- Betty.
Yes.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.408
I don't know.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.613
- Really?
- Yeah-huh.

13:40.386 --> 13:43.822
Well, I mean, after hand creams
and high heels,

13:44.723 --> 13:47.191
I'd be happy to inspire just one person.

13:47.226 --> 13:50.195
I'm sure I could get in touch with
that woman from the relief mission.

13:50.229 --> 13:52.288
- Set up an interview.
- Should I do this?

13:52.331 --> 13:53.696
- Because I think I want to do it.
- Do it.

13:53.732 --> 13:56.030
- Totally.
- Yes. You have to.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.865
Okay, I have a blog.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.703
Should this stuff be burning?

14:02.741 --> 14:04.299
Oh, no.

14:09.415 --> 14:13.010
Hey, Amanda?
Can I use the apartment later today?

14:13.052 --> 14:14.849
I'm doing this project outside of work

14:14.887 --> 14:17.355
and I need a place to do interviews
and a photo shoot.

14:17.389 --> 14:19.949
Totally. It's been empty
since we moved out, anyway.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.483
Since you what? You moved out?

14:22.528 --> 14:24.689
Oh, my God, are you serious?

14:25.064 --> 14:27.658
Marc and I moved across the hall
to the two-bedroom

14:27.700 --> 14:29.600
because we needed more space.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.364
How many times
do I have to tell you this, Betty?

14:31.403 --> 14:34.668
- Once would be nice.
- Once? Try three times.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.741
Hey, Betty, it's me.
Listen, Marc and I are moving out, so...

14:38.777 --> 14:41.439
<i>Mandy, it's Marc. Betty is 9154.</i>

14:43.816 --> 14:47.252
That's hilarious. I keep doing that. Bye.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.984
Yeah. Did we...
- Oh, um...

14:53.259 --> 14:54.954
Do you know where is Daniel Meade's...

14:54.994 --> 14:58.794
Hey, Betty. Marc and I are moving out.
I told you that, right?

14:58.831 --> 15:00.196
<i>You're sure you told me this?</i>

15:00.232 --> 15:01.927
Yes. Now settle.

15:02.334 --> 15:04.825
It's not like you were gonna
move back in, anyway.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.064
Well, no,

15:06.105 --> 15:09.836
but I didn't know you'd be giving up
my apartment for good.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.207
Betty, please, you gave up
your apartment a year ago

15:12.244 --> 15:13.973
when you moved back
to your farm or wherever.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.503
This is not a big deal.

15:15.547 --> 15:18.311
And we're done.
I'm gonna go hit the ladies'.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.476
Whatever's going on with your skin

15:19.518 --> 15:22.316
makes me feel like
I need to go hose off.

15:25.691 --> 15:27.625
Hey. What are you doing right now?

15:27.660 --> 15:29.719
Skydiving. What are you doing?

15:29.762 --> 15:32.925
I'm taking you out for a fun surprise.
Come on, let's go.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.832
Do you not see the woman
in curlers at the end of my arms?

15:35.868 --> 15:37.859
Plus I have another appointment.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.803
You know, I figured it out.

15:39.838 --> 15:42.398
You're being mean because
you're almost done raising a kid

15:42.441 --> 15:44.409
and now you got to do it all again.

15:44.443 --> 15:49.403
So, as of now, okay, this?
This is "Hilda Week. "

15:49.448 --> 15:53.145
I'm taking you out every day,
we're gonna do something for you,

15:53.185 --> 15:54.743
so that you know
your life's not all about

15:54.787 --> 15:57.051
taking care of other people.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.524
Go. Go, or I'm going.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.860
Car's downstairs.
You need to hurry or you'll be late

16:05.898 --> 16:07.490
for your cocktails
with the Dsquared guys.

16:07.533 --> 16:08.591
You're sure the car's here?

16:08.634 --> 16:10.124
Because it never showed
at Kors yesterday.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.830
Actually, I'm sure the car showed up.

16:11.870 --> 16:14.464
- But it didn't.
- But it did. Now go.

16:15.574 --> 16:17.769
Stop, wait. Daniel.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.209
Right.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.576
- Oh!
- Marc. My jacket.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.639
Shh. I got this.

16:26.185 --> 16:27.447
What are you...

16:27.486 --> 16:30.319
See? Always prepared. Spin.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.789
Where did this jacket come from?

16:31.824 --> 16:36.227
From your dry-cleaning.
And it fits flawlessly.

16:36.895 --> 16:39.022
Now, get out of here.
You have to be at Waverly in 10.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.588
I thought I was going to Farmhouse.

16:40.632 --> 16:44.796
Okay, all this doubting me
is starting to get a little upsetting.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.431
Okay, wow. She's very sensitive.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.900
Hey, I just did my first "she. "

16:51.777 --> 16:52.903
Yeah.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.884
- So, what do you think?
- I love it.

17:01.887 --> 17:04.082
"To inspire at least one person. "

17:04.123 --> 17:05.146
Mmm.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.919
Ooh!

17:06.959 --> 17:08.756
Our first interview.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.055
- Hey, there.
- Hi.

17:12.097 --> 17:13.257
Come on in.

17:39.958 --> 17:41.687
- Lee, come in.
- Hi.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.854
So, the first time I visited Botswana,

17:43.896 --> 17:46.865
I stayed in a gorgeous hotel
on the Zambezi.

17:47.299 --> 17:50.564
Amazing views, great food, the works,

17:50.936 --> 17:54.929
and just up the road was
a village of such poverty.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.739
In fact, the hotel solicits donations

17:57.776 --> 18:00.108
to help support the people
who live there,

18:00.145 --> 18:03.808
but after seeing
how these lovely people lived,

18:04.750 --> 18:07.742
I needed to do more
than just write a check.

18:12.858 --> 18:16.885
And if you could see
the smiles on their faces,

18:17.830 --> 18:20.890
the pure gratitude they feel
for so little...

18:23.368 --> 18:25.393
I don't have the words,

18:26.705 --> 18:28.798
so I'll leave that to you.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.984
So, what's my surprise?

18:40.419 --> 18:42.979
The surprise is that it's closed.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.080
Ahhh!

18:45.691 --> 18:47.420
What happened?

18:48.794 --> 18:50.955
- Cut my finger.
- Let me see.

18:51.697 --> 18:54.131
Okay, wait, let me get a thingy.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.899
Okay, so what am I missing here?

18:57.903 --> 18:59.598
Concert. Ace of Base.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.072
Ace of Base?

19:02.107 --> 19:03.734
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.

19:04.042 --> 19:06.033
I remember how much
we used to like them in high school.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.205
Love. We loved them.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.441
Yeah, I don't know what's up.

19:10.482 --> 19:14.543
You know, my friend Perry told me
they're playing here Tuesday.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.076
It's Wednesday.

19:16.121 --> 19:17.952
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.287
You know,
here I am trying to make you feel

19:19.324 --> 19:21.758
like you don't have to take care
of people all the time,

19:21.793 --> 19:23.852
and look at you right now.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.398
We'll just do something tomorrow.
You did say it's Hilda Week, right?

19:28.433 --> 19:31.425
- That's right, I did. Yeah, let's go.
- Okay.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.434
<i>So, did you publish it yet?</i>

19:34.473 --> 19:38.102
No, not yet. I'm scared.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.239
What if no one reads it?

19:40.279 --> 19:42.179
They will. I promise.

19:42.648 --> 19:44.878
Look, do it now while
I'm on the phone with you.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.214
Mmm.

19:47.252 --> 19:48.913
Okay. Ready?

19:57.629 --> 19:59.256
What? What happened? Did it crash?

19:59.298 --> 20:02.358
No. Someone's at the door.
I'll call you back.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.129
The landlord?

20:11.076 --> 20:15.206
- Mr. Z.
- I sent you letters, I call your work.

20:16.114 --> 20:17.274
What are you trying to pull?

20:17.316 --> 20:18.476
What are you talking about?

20:18.517 --> 20:21.452
I want you out of here
by the end of the week.

20:21.486 --> 20:24.319
And if I don't get those
last two months of back rent,

20:24.356 --> 20:26.290
I am going to sue.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.784
What? Two months' back rent?

20:29.828 --> 20:31.921
That's right, two months.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.955
<i>- But...
Stop. Hold up.</i>

20:34.600 --> 20:36.795
You make me sound
like a crazy person,

20:36.835 --> 20:38.860
and you get to be all innocent.

20:38.904 --> 20:42.704
I am innocent,
and you were very angry.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.642
Oh, so it's me then?
I'm the worst part of your week?

20:45.677 --> 20:47.804
No. It gets worse.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.775
Oh!

20:53.418 --> 20:54.817
Keep going.

21:03.128 --> 21:06.063
Oh, sweet Betty.
Don't scare me like that.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.623
Good thing I just took a leak
or this could have gotten really ugly.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.261
You moved out of
my apartment two months ago?

21:11.303 --> 21:14.033
And you haven't paid any rent since?

21:17.542 --> 21:18.975
Help, I'm scared.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.137
You should be, Amanda.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.738
I can't afford to pay
two months of back rent.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.214
Okay, I told you about that.

21:24.249 --> 21:26.308
It is not my fault
that you're deaf or whatever.

21:26.351 --> 21:28.717
Stop talking. You are going to fix this.

21:28.754 --> 21:31.655
Find the money, talk to Mr. Z,
do whatever you have to do,

21:31.690 --> 21:34.250
but this is your problem, not mine.

21:44.403 --> 21:46.837
Marc, why didn't you tell me
that you moved out of my apartment?

21:46.872 --> 21:49.397
God, who can remember?
That was months ago.

21:49.441 --> 21:51.966
A hundred words on Wilhelmina's desk
by the end of the day.

21:52.010 --> 21:54.035
No. What is that?

21:54.079 --> 21:56.411
Something for the hair, I think.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.006
It's fine, I guess.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.951
I'm doing my own thing now,
and I'm very proud of it.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.716
Oh. Another hit. I have my own blog.

22:03.755 --> 22:06.656
Aw, welcome to six years ago.

22:07.693 --> 22:11.322
That was uncalled for.
Aw, welcome to two years ago.

22:11.363 --> 22:12.728
Thank you.

22:12.764 --> 22:14.755
- Hey, quitter.
- Fancy.

22:14.800 --> 22:15.858
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.061
I got three hits.

22:17.102 --> 22:19.866
And one of them said,
"You inspired me. "

22:20.138 --> 22:22.402
Congratulations. I saw that.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.500
- Wait, was that you?
- It was.

22:24.543 --> 22:25.567
And actually that's why I'm here.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.942
- You have a minute?
- Sure.

22:28.246 --> 22:29.611
Amanda, send my calls to voicemail.

22:29.648 --> 22:31.878
Marc forgot my lunch again.
I'm starving. I'll be back in 10.

22:31.917 --> 22:35.250
But these ladies from Neiman's
are here to see you.

22:35.687 --> 22:36.949
Really?

22:37.289 --> 22:40.281
So, I thought our meeting
was tomorrow,

22:40.325 --> 22:41.656
but clearly it's not,

22:41.693 --> 22:45.424
because you're here today,
looking so lovely, I might add.

22:45.464 --> 22:47.056
I think you remember
where my office is,

22:47.099 --> 22:48.623
just down the hall to the right.

22:48.667 --> 22:51.693
I'll be there in a jiff, I promise.
Thank you so much for coming.

22:51.737 --> 22:52.897
Where the hell is Marc?

22:52.938 --> 22:54.200
He just left with Willie.

22:54.239 --> 22:56.104
Oh, of course he did.

22:56.141 --> 22:58.803
Ever since we've been sharing him,
he's been a total screw-up.

22:58.844 --> 23:00.641
You know, he's been getting
my appointments wrong,

23:00.679 --> 23:02.271
he forgets my lunch every other day.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.179
He actually sent me
to the wrong bar last night,

23:04.216 --> 23:05.274
can you believe that?

23:05.317 --> 23:07.046
And the guys from Dsquared
had to come meet me.

23:07.085 --> 23:08.985
I looked like a total ass.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.456
Okay, no offense,
but this is totally your fault.

23:12.491 --> 23:15.358
Marc's a genius, and you're not
the best communicator in the world.

23:16.495 --> 23:21.398
See? I knew what you meant just then,
but we've had sex, so it's definitely you.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.533
And Willie would kill
to have Marc back.

23:26.304 --> 23:29.330
Oh, my... That's it. That little...

23:29.841 --> 23:31.968
That's exactly what he's doing.

23:32.010 --> 23:35.707
Okay, that right there?
I have no idea what you just said.

23:35.747 --> 23:36.805
So, guess what.

23:36.848 --> 23:38.372
You remember when I said my friend

23:38.417 --> 23:40.647
told me Ace of Base
was playing Tuesday?

23:40.685 --> 23:42.915
And you said,
"It's Wednesday, dumbass. "

23:42.954 --> 23:45.548
I don't think I said "dumbass," but...

23:45.590 --> 23:50.323
Well, I was wrong.
They're playing today.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.762
Bobby!

23:52.998 --> 23:55.193
Well, it might take you a few tries,
Talercio,

23:55.233 --> 23:57.997
but when you come through,
you really come through.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.162
That's right.

23:59.204 --> 24:03.538
Plus we're having ourselves
a little sidewalk picnic like we used to,

24:03.575 --> 24:07.568
except instead of candy bars and beer,
we're gonna have actual food.

24:07.612 --> 24:08.874
Oh.

24:08.914 --> 24:11.212
And prenatal vitamins.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.480
Oh, my God. You think of everything.

24:15.754 --> 24:18.086
It's home. Let me get this.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.921
Hi, honey, what's up? It's Justin.

24:23.562 --> 24:26.258
Oh, no. Are you all right?

24:28.500 --> 24:32.334
Okay. All right. Just give me...

24:33.672 --> 24:36.140
No, Justin, it's fine. I'm not that far.

24:36.174 --> 24:38.972
All right? Justin, don't worry.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.608
Okay. I love you.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.648
Okay, bye.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.349
He's sick.

24:47.118 --> 24:48.415
How sick?

24:48.587 --> 24:50.487
Sick enough that I got to go.

24:50.522 --> 24:53.787
But I want you to stay.
This was the best idea.

24:54.159 --> 24:57.128
I can't stay.
Come on, this is Hilda Week.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.186
So what?

24:58.230 --> 25:00.494
You just have fun
and come over tomorrow,

25:00.532 --> 25:02.523
you'll tell me all about it.

25:02.567 --> 25:06.503
So sweet. Thank you.
Have a good time. Stay, have fun.

25:13.912 --> 25:17.848
So, after hearing Lee's amazing
stories about Botswana,

25:17.883 --> 25:20.249
I dropped by the mission offices
to drop off another check.

25:20.285 --> 25:22.048
Really? I love that.

25:22.087 --> 25:24.248
God, Betty, what these people do...

25:24.289 --> 25:27.452
Here, I've got to show you this.
Look at this map.

25:27.492 --> 25:29.790
Okay, here is the village,

25:30.061 --> 25:32.791
and this is how far away the river is.

25:32.831 --> 25:36.790
Now they have a pump
in their village because of us.

25:38.570 --> 25:41.004
- What?
- Nothing. I just...

25:41.806 --> 25:44.104
I've never seen you like this.

25:44.342 --> 25:49.041
So excited and I love that
you're experiencing this.

25:49.481 --> 25:51.005
Good. Me, too.

25:51.049 --> 25:54.348
Because that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.283
I spoke with Lee
and she said if I wanted,

25:57.322 --> 26:00.519
I could volunteer for the next tour.

26:01.092 --> 26:04.255
For the what? For a tour of what?

26:05.263 --> 26:07.288
- Of Africa?
- Yeah.

26:07.332 --> 26:08.765
Wait, like, Africa-Africa?

26:08.800 --> 26:12.668
Yeah, look, I know it sounds sudden,
but I want to do this.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.867
I want to leave with them next week.

26:29.054 --> 26:31.921
Hello, I'm here to see Connor Owens.

26:32.190 --> 26:36.456
I'd like a table in the corner,
away from everyone else, please.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.462
It's funny how it only takes
20 bucks and five minutes

26:45.503 --> 26:48.199
on the computer to get re-ordained
to marry you and Connor,

26:48.239 --> 26:51.436
yet it's completely illegal for me
to marry a man myself.

26:51.476 --> 26:54.809
Are you gonna bring that up
every time I get married?

26:54.846 --> 26:56.040
Excuse me, what's his name again?

26:56.081 --> 26:57.571
Connor Owens.

26:58.383 --> 27:00.442
Says here he's been transferred.

27:00.485 --> 27:01.611
What?

27:01.653 --> 27:03.814
What are you talking about?
Transferred where?

27:03.855 --> 27:05.948
I'm afraid I can't tell you that,

27:05.991 --> 27:09.017
but he's definitely
no longer at this prison.

27:14.165 --> 27:15.189
This is not possible.

27:15.233 --> 27:17.292
Connor Owens
has not been transferred.

27:17.335 --> 27:20.236
You go get him and tell him
Wilhelmina Slater is here now for him.

27:20.271 --> 27:22.637
- Go get him.
- Ma'am, he's gone,

27:22.674 --> 27:25.234
but there is an envelope
for Wilhelmina Slater here.

27:25.276 --> 27:28.109
I don't want an envelope. I want him.

27:28.513 --> 27:30.947
We're supposed to be
getting married today, you fool!

27:30.982 --> 27:34.281
Don't you think he would have told me
if he was being transferred?

27:34.319 --> 27:36.219
Damn you. Connor. Connor!

27:36.254 --> 27:38.154
You're gonna have to
calm her down or we will.

27:38.189 --> 27:39.213
Willie, maybe you should...

27:39.257 --> 27:41.316
No. Did he do this?

27:41.793 --> 27:43.852
Did he make this happen?

27:44.329 --> 27:46.092
He did, didn't he?

27:47.232 --> 27:49.132
- Answer me.
- Willie.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.797
Don't look at me like that.

27:57.976 --> 27:59.375
Six months?

27:59.878 --> 28:01.778
Why do you have to go
for a whole six months?

28:01.813 --> 28:03.940
Well, they want you to commit
to at least that long

28:03.982 --> 28:05.074
so that they know you're serious.

28:05.116 --> 28:09.985
Wait, "at least that long"?
Matt, this is a big move.

28:10.455 --> 28:11.752
Betty.

28:13.091 --> 28:17.755
Look, you said that I needed to find
meaning in my life and you were right.

28:17.796 --> 28:21.095
I mean, I've wasted
so much time asking myself,

28:21.132 --> 28:23.430
"What do I need? What do I want?"

28:23.468 --> 28:26.801
But your story got me
to ask a different question.

28:26.838 --> 28:29.329
Like, "What do other people need?"

28:29.574 --> 28:31.906
What is this gonna mean for us?

28:32.010 --> 28:33.705
Well, would it have
to change anything?

28:33.745 --> 28:35.440
How could it not?

28:36.114 --> 28:38.241
Matt, you're gonna be living
on the other side of the world

28:38.283 --> 28:39.944
for a long time.

28:40.585 --> 28:43.486
And I thought that
you would be happy for me.

28:43.521 --> 28:46.547
Look, I feel like there's some perfect
thing I'm supposed to say right now.

28:46.591 --> 28:48.183
And it's...

28:48.226 --> 28:50.854
This is big, and it's sudden, and...

28:51.396 --> 28:54.365
I don't know,
I have to wash my hair for Wilhelmina.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.128
Look, I've got to... I have to go.

28:56.167 --> 29:00.103
Betty, look, you said you wanted
to inspire one person,

29:00.572 --> 29:02.096
and you did.

29:10.148 --> 29:13.049
Africa? Matt can't survive in Africa.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.449
It's crazy, right?

29:14.486 --> 29:16.044
Living in a house made of sticks,

29:16.087 --> 29:18.920
looking for a place
to plug in his blow-dryer.

29:18.957 --> 29:22.688
Please, getting his hair all tall like that?
That takes a blow-out. I know.

29:22.727 --> 29:24.251
It's just so Matt, you know.

29:24.295 --> 29:26.763
It's like one minute he's a lawyer,

29:26.798 --> 29:29.494
the next he's an artist,
the next he's African,

29:29.534 --> 29:31.297
and I'm just supposed
to go along with all of it?

29:31.336 --> 29:33.327
Like I don't mind
being another temporary thing

29:33.371 --> 29:35.669
in his life that he will eventually
move on from?

29:35.707 --> 29:38.699
I mean, he should be
considering me in this, right?

29:38.743 --> 29:41.803
Hey, I don't like to get
all up in your business.

29:41.846 --> 29:43.438
But hell, yes, he should.

29:43.481 --> 29:44.607
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.412
But I'm not allowed to say that. No.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.419
Because then I sound
like a selfish monster

29:48.453 --> 29:49.647
telling the person I love,

29:49.687 --> 29:52.588
"No, Matt,
you can't go to Africa to help people. "

29:52.624 --> 29:55.616
Hey, you sound however you want.

29:56.027 --> 29:57.119
Ah.

29:58.463 --> 30:01.455
<i>Who's that?
Papi's supposed to be at work.</i>

30:01.766 --> 30:03.597
Ah, they crack me up.

30:04.235 --> 30:07.693
Bobby. What are you doing here?
When did you get here?

30:07.739 --> 30:09.036
I got here about five minutes ago.

30:09.073 --> 30:12.565
I brought this one some of my
Uncle Hugo's special fever soup.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.077
It's guaranteed to work.

30:14.112 --> 30:15.340
It's hideous.

30:15.380 --> 30:19.373
The ingredients are chicken broth,
evil, and dirt.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.385
Hey, you. Just drink it.

30:21.419 --> 30:23.580
You'll be up and dancing
by tomorrow morning.

30:23.621 --> 30:25.851
I swear on Madonna's cheeks.

30:28.359 --> 30:31.954
Hey, I told you, it's Hilda Week.
Upstairs, go.

30:31.996 --> 30:35.056
Read a book, take a bath,
whatever you want.

30:35.099 --> 30:36.566
I got this.

30:37.902 --> 30:40.462
Ahhh! That's it.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.402
Excuse me, Wilhelmina.

30:42.440 --> 30:45.375
I'm sorry to barge in,
but I would like a second of your time.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.742
I need to ask you
to please stop torturing me.

30:47.779 --> 30:50.475
My foot hurts, my armpits hurt,

30:50.515 --> 30:53.746
and now my scalp is burning.

30:54.219 --> 30:56.346
All because I wanted to write something

30:56.387 --> 30:59.686
that maybe could make the world
a little bit better.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.423
So, that's it. That's...

31:08.800 --> 31:09.858
That's what I wanted to say.

31:09.901 --> 31:12.768
Today was supposed to be
my wedding day.

31:14.505 --> 31:15.870
To Connor.

31:16.975 --> 31:18.465
But he made himself disappear.

31:18.509 --> 31:22.036
With money or connections or I don't...
I don't know.

31:23.781 --> 31:27.012
And the worst part is
he thinks he did it for me,

31:27.385 --> 31:29.353
so I can live my life.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.724
I know how to chase people
who've wronged me

31:34.759 --> 31:38.559
but I don't know how to chase people
who say they love me

31:39.163 --> 31:40.892
and then do this.

31:43.801 --> 31:46.235
Well, obviously he loves you.

31:47.405 --> 31:50.169
That couldn't have been easy for him.

31:54.279 --> 31:56.213
He thinks this is love?

31:57.982 --> 32:00.644
If he loved me, he'd do what I want.

32:04.822 --> 32:06.289
Not this.

32:13.398 --> 32:14.763
Please go.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.984
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:44.829 --> 32:47.229
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

32:47.265 --> 32:48.527
I wanted to talk to you, too.

32:48.566 --> 32:51.364
I feel bad about dumping
all that on you before.

32:51.402 --> 32:53.666
Yeah, I totally freaked out.

32:53.938 --> 32:55.235
Yeah, of course you did.

32:55.273 --> 32:58.106
And I've been thinking about it
and maybe you're right.

32:58.142 --> 33:01.111
You know, maybe for our sake
I should stay in New York.

33:01.145 --> 33:03.045
Maybe I could do some good here
and maybe I was just

33:03.081 --> 33:05.982
- getting way ahead...
- Wait, wait, whoa, Matt.

33:06.017 --> 33:08.542
Stop. That's a lot of maybes.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.387
I didn't mean it that way. I...

33:10.421 --> 33:12.013
You have to go.

33:13.024 --> 33:14.958
You have to do this.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.387
- Are you serious?
- Very.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.924
Are you sure about this?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.401
If you are.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.168
I am.

33:33.177 --> 33:37.136
But the one thing you cannot do
is doubt how I feel about you.

33:39.150 --> 33:40.640
Betty, you changed my life,

33:40.685 --> 33:41.777
and that lasts forever,

33:41.819 --> 33:44.754
no matter where we may stand
in the world.

33:47.825 --> 33:49.190
Well...

33:50.828 --> 33:53.422
Now I have something to write about.

33:54.732 --> 33:56.199
Goodbyes.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.871
Coffee.
- Coffee?

34:12.917 --> 34:14.714
Marc, I asked you to get my dinner.

34:14.752 --> 34:17.516
- Darn it, I knew I forgot something.
- Okay, Marc, you know what?

34:17.554 --> 34:19.750
I understand why you're making
all these mistakes.

34:19.791 --> 34:23.351
You want me to fire you so you can go
back to working for Wilhelmina.

34:23.393 --> 34:26.261
If that's what you want to do,
you should just do it.

34:26.297 --> 34:27.355
Get on that scale.

34:27.398 --> 34:28.728
Since when do I have a scale
in my office?

34:28.766 --> 34:31.234
Since you have me in here. Hop on.

34:35.273 --> 34:37.070
- I lost eight pounds.
- Yes.

34:37.108 --> 34:40.339
Because I "messed up" your lunches
and "forgot" to book your cars,

34:40.378 --> 34:42.437
so you'd stop eating like a lonely girl

34:42.480 --> 34:44.675
and actually use those legs a little bit.

34:44.715 --> 34:47.183
And look here. One, two, three.

34:47.217 --> 34:50.152
That's how many times
you were photographed this week.

34:50.188 --> 34:51.212
Let me ask you something,

34:51.255 --> 34:54.121
how many times were you
photographed last month?

34:54.158 --> 34:55.955
- Once.
- Exactly.

34:55.993 --> 34:58.427
But this time you were
outside the Waverly,

34:58.463 --> 35:00.090
where there is actually paparazzi,

35:00.131 --> 35:03.259
instead of the Farmhouse,
where there is not.

35:03.301 --> 35:07.533
And you were in this slimming jacket
that looks great in black and white.

35:07.572 --> 35:11.975
And furthermore, are you aware that
you come off a little bit needy?

35:12.410 --> 35:14.469
I do? Really?

35:14.879 --> 35:16.346
- Do I?
- You do.

35:16.380 --> 35:20.077
Which is why I let the boys
from Dsquared go to the wrong bar,

35:20.118 --> 35:21.983
because those queens
should go to you.

35:22.019 --> 35:23.884
And, PS, it worked.

35:25.189 --> 35:28.488
Dsquared, Michael Kors, Coach.
They're all back.

35:28.526 --> 35:32.326
So, as you can see, in actuality,

35:32.363 --> 35:34.593
I did all this for you.

35:34.899 --> 35:36.833
Unbelievable. Well, I...

35:37.368 --> 35:40.428
Why didn't you just come tell me
about all this stuff?

35:40.471 --> 35:45.135
Well, because when I told you
to shave your beard, you refused.

35:46.944 --> 35:49.845
But lucky for me,
now you have to shave it.

35:49.881 --> 35:50.939
Because there's gum in it.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.677
There isn't gum in my beard. Why...

35:52.717 --> 35:54.378
What are you...

35:55.019 --> 35:58.682
We can do this your way or my way.

36:15.439 --> 36:16.667
Coming.

36:17.608 --> 36:18.973
Coming.

36:19.377 --> 36:20.639
Here.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.036
It's not everything,

36:22.079 --> 36:24.547
but I sold some of my hair
to make up for the rent money.

36:24.582 --> 36:26.277
But your hair looks the same.

36:26.317 --> 36:28.342
Okay, I sold extensions. Used ones.

36:28.386 --> 36:31.082
But I still want you to have the cash.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.659
Look, Betty, I moved out
right after Matt chose you over me.

36:35.693 --> 36:39.151
I needed to start over
and I was too hurt and mad

36:39.197 --> 36:40.960
to talk to you about it.

36:40.998 --> 36:42.761
It was so stupid.

36:43.267 --> 36:46.031
Well, now we've both lost him.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.771
He's moving away for a while.

36:50.141 --> 36:51.199
Oh.

36:52.243 --> 36:53.676
- Don't smile.
- I'm not.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.406
You're totally smiling.

36:55.446 --> 36:57.880
So, what are you gonna do?

37:01.619 --> 37:03.883
I guess I'm starting over, too.

37:06.257 --> 37:09.420
Well, I heard about an open apartment,

37:09.460 --> 37:12.987
and it's close to me,
which I wouldn't totally hate.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.404
It's Betty. Can we talk?

37:29.447 --> 37:31.005
Oh, that is a rough week.

37:31.048 --> 37:32.447
I told you.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.284
So, what do you say?

37:35.853 --> 37:38.048
Can we figure something out?

37:38.689 --> 37:41.749
Maybe you could raise my rent a little?

37:42.193 --> 37:44.457
I could pay you back over time?

37:44.495 --> 37:49.262
What if I raise Amanda's rent
and make her pay me back?

37:49.567 --> 37:51.660
Yeah, that could work.

37:55.039 --> 37:58.475
Did you ever write that piece
on goodbyes?

38:01.612 --> 38:04.080
Just the first paragraph. Why?

38:04.682 --> 38:07.242
My old lady left me six months ago.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.112
She said I let myself go.

38:10.888 --> 38:14.790
Point is, I get it.
I know what it means to have to

38:15.626 --> 38:18.891
start over and everything.

38:20.698 --> 38:23.189
You read me that paragraph

38:24.535 --> 38:26.435
and I'll let you move back in.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.097
- Really?
- Really.

38:29.740 --> 38:33.676
Um, yeah, sure. I can do that.

38:33.711 --> 38:36.009
- You got it there?
- Right here.

38:38.549 --> 38:40.449
It's just a rough draft, though.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.748
- I won't judge.
- Okay.

38:46.924 --> 38:50.860
"I've had to say goodbye
more times than I would have liked,

38:50.895 --> 38:52.522
<i>"but everyone can say that. "</i>

39:15.052 --> 39:17.282
<i>"And no matter
how many times we do it,</i>

39:17.321 --> 39:20.882
<i>"even when it's for the greater good,
it still stings. "</i>

39:23.961 --> 39:26.691
- You think she bought it?
- Yeah.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.966
I'll have my guy
make the deposit today.

39:51.489 --> 39:54.583
<i>"And though we'll never forget
what we've given up,</i>

39:54.625 --> 39:57.594
<i>"we owe it to ourselves
to keep moving forward. "</i>

39:58.295 --> 40:00.695
For tomorrow, more Hilda time?

40:01.899 --> 40:05.096
No, I don't need more Hilda time.

40:06.437 --> 40:09.133
You're right.
I was freaking out because I thought,

40:09.173 --> 40:11.198
"How am I gonna do this whole

40:11.242 --> 40:13.870
"raising-a-kid thing by myself,
all over again?"

40:14.512 --> 40:18.380
But now I realize that I don't have to,
because I have you.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.116
What makes you think
I'm gonna stick around?

40:22.153 --> 40:23.245
You.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.088
You make me think it.

40:27.358 --> 40:30.191
I guess I must have done
something right.

40:30.995 --> 40:32.121
Yeah.

40:32.530 --> 40:34.430
<i>"What we can't do
is live our lives</i>

40:34.465 --> 40:36.899
<i>"always afraid of the next goodbye,</i>

40:37.535 --> 40:40.766
<i>"because chances are
they're not going to stop. "</i>

40:51.882 --> 40:53.941
I need some inspiration, too, you know.

41:51.275 --> 41:55.006
<i>"The trick is to recognize
when a goodbye can be a good thing,</i>

41:55.045 --> 41:57.343
<i>"when it's a chance to start again. "</i>
