WEBVTT

01:29.756 --> 01:33.176
Let's get
this booty-shakin' contest started!

01:34.344 --> 01:38.681
Let's go, y'all. Show some love
for booty number one!

01:42.560 --> 01:44.604
Okay. I like that.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.983
Make some noise for booty number two!

01:54.322 --> 01:57.575
Okay. That look like it hurt.

01:57.659 --> 02:02.080
Make some noise
for b-- b-- booty number three!

02:08.378 --> 02:11.131
Looks like we got a winner!

02:15.468 --> 02:16.845
Never stop believing in yourself.

02:22.058 --> 02:26.020
Oh! Oh, my God! Like, every guy in here
is looking at you right now.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.106
You're like the Nelson Mandela
of thirst trapping.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.024
I don't know who that is, but thank you.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.033
-Check it out.
-Ooh.

02:39.826 --> 02:40.869
NBA?

02:40.952 --> 02:42.495
Small forward and two guard.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.746
Zero minutes between them,

02:43.830 --> 02:45.540
but they both came out
of defensive systems

02:45.623 --> 02:47.709
and it takes a while
to get used to run-and-gun.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.962
Interesting, 'cause I didn't hear anything
after I said "NBA,"

02:51.045 --> 02:52.672
and you didn't say no.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.008
Okay, I'm gonna laugh now.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.889
-Hi.
-Hi back.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.474
Can we offer you ladies some champagne?

03:03.558 --> 03:05.727
-Oh, no. That's fine--
-We'll take two.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.147
I thought you were only doing
soda with lime

03:09.230 --> 03:10.481
'cause of your parole?

03:10.565 --> 03:13.276
I'm not supposed to be in a club either,
okay? Fuck a parole.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.862
This is the NBA, girl. Thank you.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.415
I find that I photograph best
in the morning,

03:27.498 --> 03:28.917
when the face skin is tightest.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.919
That sounds wonderful.
What am I doing here?

03:31.002 --> 03:32.462
Sorry, but it couldn't wait.

03:34.255 --> 03:38.760
This, um, inmate overdose business?
It's terrible for PR.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.513
And it is our third inmate death
in as many months,

03:42.597 --> 03:44.974
and I am facilitating a growth period
right now.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.644
It looks bad. It looks bad.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.314
Do you hear what I'm saying?
It just-- It looks bad.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.776
And we can't have that.
So we need to make some changes.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.278
So, what are you thinking

03:57.362 --> 03:59.280
Additional surveillance equipment?

03:59.364 --> 04:00.949
We could bring in a security consultant.
I know this--

04:01.032 --> 04:04.077
No, we need something bold.
Something distracting.

04:04.452 --> 04:08.039
A shiny object.
I'm replacing you as warden.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.717
You know, you really should never
be lit from below.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.886
Makes you look like a monster.

04:29.018 --> 04:34.107
-I know. Being alive is hard.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.194
I really wanna thank you
for the opportunity to earn my keep.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.781
Oh, well, I'm not gonna say
I'm not conflicted about it,

04:41.864 --> 04:43.366
but, um, it's a good arrangement.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.453
Otherwise, my whole haul from
the craft fair would be going to a sitter.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.414
Now, when you warm up the breast milk,

04:49.497 --> 04:53.084
make sure to remove the water
from the heat before they steam,

04:53.167 --> 04:56.004
otherwise it murders all the antibodies.

04:56.087 --> 05:00.508
"Steam is murder."

05:00.591 --> 05:03.386
You know, I'm sorry
I haven't been super helpful lately.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.304
Uh-huh.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.347
It's just that things with Alex are weird.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.224
You know,
I thought it was a temporary bump,

05:08.308 --> 05:12.228
like a bad vacation
or an unsolicited body criticism,

05:12.312 --> 05:14.856
but she's missed
our last two scheduled calls.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.858
-Uh...

05:16.941 --> 05:20.320
In the sink, warm water,
and, uh, don't drown her.

05:20.403 --> 05:24.032
And her socialization group is at 1:00.
I'll text you the address.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.200
"Socialization group."

05:26.284 --> 05:28.661
Yeah. It's basically just a support group
for mommies.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.999
They know all about you.
And don't let Maia breastfeed Goodall.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.001
She's trying to get everyone
to round-robin nurse

05:35.084 --> 05:37.670
so the babies get more antibodies,
but I think it's peculiar.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.048
They know all about me?
Do they know that I'm a felon?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.676
I don't think so, but to be honest,

05:43.760 --> 05:46.346
I-- I don't really remember anything
from the last six weeks.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.308
There you are.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.852
-Relax. You'll be fine.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.854
Last week was almost entirely
horror stories about episiotomies gone wrong.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.441
Okay.

05:59.650 --> 06:02.445
I am gonna miss you so much!

06:03.071 --> 06:07.533
You are smart and funny.
You have wisdom and insight.

06:08.242 --> 06:11.579
You deserve equal pay.
And strength is beauty.  Ooh.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.373
We missed her cue. Shit city.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.458
Make sure to change her
before she gets a rash. Okay. Good luck.

06:18.294 --> 06:23.674
I am trusting you with
the most important part of my life.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.719
-Don't forget to wipe front to back.
-Uh-huh.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.848
Ooh.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.935
<i>I avoided the pig</i>
<i>for some of the obvious connotations...</i>

06:37.438 --> 06:41.943
Hey, miss. Eating up all the cereal,
sitting on your butt, watching TV all day.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.695
How 'bout doing some dishes or something?
Make yourself useful. There's only ten more minutes
in this episode.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.951
Finish later. Go contribute.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.079
Nobody gets a free ride around here.

06:53.454 --> 06:57.750
You get this back when the sink is empty
and the dishwasher's full.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.378
You know how lucky you are
to even have a dishwasher?

07:00.878 --> 07:02.171
You believe these damn kids?

07:02.255 --> 07:05.550
Spoiled already! Getting all used
to the good life and shit.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.803
Corky

07:09.595 --> 07:10.638
Huh?

07:11.013 --> 07:12.974
Oh. I-- I'm sorry, honey.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.352
I'm a little out of it this morning.
I gotta run.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.896
Ain't you forgetting something?

07:18.980 --> 07:21.190
I'm sorry, I don't know
what I was thinking.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.819
-I'm kissing you goodbye.

07:28.698 --> 07:29.866
You forgot this.

07:31.367 --> 07:34.036
I told you about
Daya's friend Daddy, the OD, right?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.122
Yeah, thanks for the update.
What am I supposed to do with that?

07:36.205 --> 07:38.082
And I told you
about all the drug seizures, didn't I?

07:38.166 --> 07:41.711
Exactly. That means bitches in there
ain't got drugs now.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.797
That's supply and demand. Business shit.

07:44.881 --> 07:48.134
Yeah, only the prison is on high alert.
You know what that means?

07:48.217 --> 07:50.970
It means that corporate is havin' us
doing random drug searches every hour.

07:51.053 --> 07:54.223
I just got an email that Fig
is getting transferred because of this.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.683
Now is not the time.

07:56.392 --> 07:59.979
Fig is getting transferred?
That means they looking for a new warden.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.814
So?

08:01.898 --> 08:03.900
So? You need to step up!

08:04.817 --> 08:06.194
You should be running that place.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.905
-Hell yeah!

08:08.988 --> 08:12.033
Just sign a few papers, lockdown.
Anybody could do that shit.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.993
Plus, you're next in line.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.663
Think about how much easier
smuggling would be, huh?

08:17.747 --> 08:20.291
You better go to corporate
and take what's yours.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.003
Warden. I never even
considered that before.

08:24.086 --> 08:29.091
Well, it's a good thing
Corky got a businesswoman by his side.

08:31.219 --> 08:34.263
Maybe we can come up
with a different pet name for me?

08:35.181 --> 08:37.183
["Night Games" by Alcatrazz
playing over car speakers]

08:40.978 --> 08:42.271
For Artesian?

08:42.355 --> 08:46.025
<i>♪ See the man in the busy street</i>
<i>He's almost incomplete ♪</i>

08:46.776 --> 08:47.860
Thanks for the ride.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.906
I could buy a new car for what
they're asking to fix my transmission.

08:51.989 --> 08:55.451
Hey, no worries.
You can pay me back however you want.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.373
-I'm gonna take the bus tomorrow.

09:00.456 --> 09:03.668
Can't. Doesn't run early enough
to make the morning drug search.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.545
This is such horseshit!

09:05.628 --> 09:07.922
Why do I have to come in early
to be searched,

09:08.005 --> 09:10.633
without pay, when everyone knows
who's smuggling?

09:13.135 --> 09:13.970
They do?

09:14.053 --> 09:16.889
You don't bring in three burritos a day
and look like Hellman.

09:18.849 --> 09:19.684
Oh.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.728
So you've been checking out his figure?

09:22.812 --> 09:28.651
Ew. No, I fucking hate that guy.
I wish he'd get caught.

09:30.194 --> 09:32.738
You're talking about him
going to prison, you know.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.576
You're not thinking about snitching,
are ya?

09:38.077 --> 09:39.078
No.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.622
I'm part of the team.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.263
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Pena,

09:57.346 --> 09:59.640
are you fuckin' vision impaired?
You didn't even touch it.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.183
I think my scope's fucked up.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.893
Did you check the part
that goes between your legs?

10:02.977 --> 10:03.978
Could be there's a rod missing.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.730
Yeah, I'll pull it out
and you can see for yourself.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.523
-Maybe suck it.
Okay.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.524
Calm it down, ladies.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.904
I noticed you put a lot of pressure
on your shoulder when you fire--

10:13.988 --> 10:15.698
McCullough, you giving him beauty tips?

10:15.781 --> 10:16.699
Mind your own business.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.077
You just wanna make sure
that shoulder pressure stays consistent.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.288
That's a good idea. She can teach you
to shoot even more like a pussy.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.956
Hit more of my target than you.

10:24.665 --> 10:26.167
PFC McCullough.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.592
You know you're not making any friends
by showing off like that.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.762
I was only trying to help Pena
with his shooting.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.598
That's all fine, but you need these boys
to respect you and like you.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.601
You gotta show them
you're part of the team.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.561
How do I do that, Sarge?

10:46.062 --> 10:47.938
It's my job to prepare you for combat,
is it not?

10:49.398 --> 10:52.485
So when you're in the combat zone
and one of those boys yells "contact,"

10:52.568 --> 10:54.695
you need to be able
to look at every one of them in the eye

10:54.779 --> 10:56.739
and know that if they have to
put their life on the line for you,

10:56.822 --> 10:58.074
there'll be no hesitation.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.036
-So find a way.
-Yes, Sarge.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.087
-Ugh.

11:11.962 --> 11:15.216
My ear is moist now.
What the hell is wrong with you?

11:15.299 --> 11:17.009
What's wrong with me
is you haven't fucking paid me yet.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.513
Yeah, I need
to talk to you about that.

11:25.267 --> 11:29.522
These random drug searches
are making it impossible for me to sell.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.900
So you need to hang on to this
until things calm down.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.027
It's only a matter of time
before they check in on me,

11:35.111 --> 11:37.405
and I am not swallowing this again.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.198
They're searching our lockers twice a day,

11:39.281 --> 11:41.826
so you better Tampax that thing
before I make like I caught you with it.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.494
I can't tuck it in my undies

11:43.577 --> 11:45.705
'cause I got a really big dick.
Ain't enough room.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.165
Yeah, 'cause that's how guys
with really big dicks talk.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.834
You wouldn't believe how big.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.961
So be a good girl
and sell the rest of that package,

11:52.044 --> 11:54.463
or I'll shove my jumbo dick
down your throat, too. Now I know for sure you're a fuckin' dyke.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.761
Most girls would've creamed at that offer.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.895
-It just doesn't make sense.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.939
Are you gonna eat
those little meaty fingers?

12:12.022 --> 12:13.858
How can I think about eating
little meat fingers

12:13.941 --> 12:15.609
when there's so much going on right now?

12:15.693 --> 12:17.486
What's going on right now?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.905
Did Old Man Frieda
finally come out of her cell?

12:19.989 --> 12:24.660
No, I am not going to be distracted
by Old Man Frieda and her haunted cell.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.537
This is important.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.291
Taystee didn't kill anyone, right?

12:31.208 --> 12:34.545
But the court says that she is a murderer.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.381
-So--

12:37.465 --> 12:42.178
So, the system must have made a mistake!

12:42.803 --> 12:46.182
I know, it sounds impossible,
but that has to be what happened.

12:46.265 --> 12:49.643
The court system actually made a mistake.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.979
-Oh, shit.
-I know.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.606
Should we call the president?

12:54.732 --> 12:56.233
I'm gonna ask somebody
if they have his number.

12:56.317 --> 12:59.278
Hey! Does anybody got
the president's number on them?

12:59.361 --> 13:01.113
No?
-No--

13:01.197 --> 13:04.158
P-Tuck. P-Tuck, stop playing
"call the president." This is serious.

13:04.492 --> 13:08.120
The court system actually made a mistake.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.748
Big whoop!
The court system always makes mistakes.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.583
Oh, yeah, okay.

13:12.666 --> 13:13.876
Oh, yeah, okay.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.253
So you think that everybody here
deserves to be here?

13:17.421 --> 13:18.339
Yes.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.886
Ethel, she threatened
a school bus full of children

13:23.969 --> 13:26.764
and one kid had an asthma attack and died.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.974
I didn't know he had asthma. Mmm-mmm.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.811
Well, Judith, she threw acid
in a woman's face.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.646
All right. What about you?

13:35.105 --> 13:39.443
I deserve to be here. I hurt a boy. Dylan.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.695
Right, but you're...  You're crazy.

13:41.779 --> 13:45.533
-I'm--
-Special-brained. Whatever.

13:46.617 --> 13:49.662
But do you really think
you deserve to be here?

14:02.132 --> 14:06.470
I wanna take this time to thank everybody
who came out to pay tribute to our friend,

14:07.388 --> 14:10.349
our leader, our protector,

14:11.851 --> 14:12.685
Daddy.

14:15.020 --> 14:15.980
I know...

14:17.106 --> 14:18.899
I know she would've appreciated it.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.986
And now Swope has a poem
she'd like to share.

14:33.038 --> 14:37.918
"In the twilight of a moon
as full and new as the burning sun

14:38.002 --> 14:40.713
You enter me with your fingers

14:41.755 --> 14:44.758
And when you enter me, slick and smooth

14:44.842 --> 14:47.136
Fingers warm like hot breath
against my neck..."

14:47.219 --> 14:49.013
Where the fuck is Diaz?

14:50.514 --> 14:53.100
Would you show up to a memorial service
for somebody you poisoned?

14:54.351 --> 14:57.897
Saw it in her face when she found out.
Fuckin' nothing.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.650
Yeah, that bitch made a move.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.528
We're gonna have
to make a move of our own.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.573
"I explode with the thunderous crack
of a thousand tiny hearts

15:07.656 --> 15:12.328
Breaking across
the greater metropolitan areola"

15:19.835 --> 15:21.795
What do you want?
-I just...

15:21.879 --> 15:24.965
I just noticed that you wasn't
at the memorial service and, like...

15:25.049 --> 15:27.217
I just wanted to tell you
that you shouldn't be afraid

15:27.301 --> 15:29.845
to acknowledge your grief to people.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.889
It's the first step in moving on.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.392
-I read it in a pamphlet.

15:36.060 --> 15:40.105
You know, pamphlets really been helping me
take my life in a new direction.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.565
They're free in the rec room.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.817
Well, your pamphlet is wrong
about my situation.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.235
I ain't welcome down there.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.864
But why would people not want you to go
to your own girlfriend's memorial service?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.824
Because...

15:52.826 --> 15:55.621
She made her own decisions.
You cannot blame yourself for this.

15:55.704 --> 15:56.789
Yes, I can.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.041
You didn't make her
take those drugs, Daya.

16:09.051 --> 16:09.885
Oh.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.263
Oh, shit.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.350
Look, I just wanted
to teach her a lesson.

16:16.433 --> 16:20.270
I wanted her to stop cheating.
I didn't think she was gonna fuckin' die.

16:20.854 --> 16:23.023
Barb just freaked out when she took it.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.442
Do the other girls know?
-I think so.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.236
You cannot go down there.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.030
Um...

16:30.531 --> 16:34.326
Maybe this is a way out.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.705
-No, like, for real.

16:37.788 --> 16:41.542
For real. Look, you can leave
this whole gang thing behind.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.585
You could get clean.
You already got a life sentence, right?

16:43.669 --> 16:44.795
So you go to the administration

16:44.878 --> 16:48.424
and maybe they can transfer you
for your own protection.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.301
Send me where To the SHU?

16:51.385 --> 16:53.095
It's better than getting shanked,
all right?

16:53.178 --> 16:57.266
It's worth a shot. You got somebody
in the admin that you trust?

17:06.984 --> 17:07.985
Are you sexy?

17:09.194 --> 17:10.738
Are you sexy?

17:11.488 --> 17:13.532
-You're a sexy motherfucker!
-Yeah, I am.

17:13.615 --> 17:18.871
-You are a sexy motherfucker! Yes!
-I am a sexy motherfucker.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.540
Uh, hello? Uh, hi, this is Rick Hopper.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.292
I'd like to be transferred
to Linda Ferguson, please.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.212
-Mmm-hmm.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.467
-This better be important.
<i> Hi, Linda!</i>

17:31.550 --> 17:35.554
Um, you know, I can call back
if it's a bad time, or--

17:37.514 --> 17:40.142
Arms folded or unfolded

17:40.225 --> 17:43.312
Because I don't wanna look like
a local news anchor. Or do I?

17:43.896 --> 17:44.772
Maybe I do.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.028
-I'm waiting, Mr. Hopper.
<i>-Uh, yeah, I-- I was...</i>

17:51.111 --> 17:53.822
I was wondering
if you had given any thought

17:53.906 --> 17:57.034
to, uh, who you were going to pick
to be the next warden.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.078
I see. Don't worry, Mr. Hopper,
you're at the top of our list.

18:00.704 --> 18:05.042
That's great. I'm at the top of the list.
That's wonderful.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.752
Uh, yes!

18:07.252 --> 18:08.962
Speaking of,
do you have any recommendations

18:09.046 --> 18:10.798
for your replacement as head guard?

18:10.881 --> 18:13.133
<i>Uh, I don't know. </i>

18:13.217 --> 18:18.597
Officer Hellman. Officer Stefanovic.
Uh, honestly, anybody but Alvarez.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.141
Alvarez, huh?
A Hispanic could be interesting.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.393
There is a big federal incentive
for diversity hires.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.896
Except for he's not really Hispanic, so--

18:25.979 --> 18:29.066
Great. So just send me a list of names
by this afternoon,

18:29.149 --> 18:30.901
and we will get on with the interviews.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.152
<i>-Okay--</i>

18:33.570 --> 18:37.491
You're a sexy motherfucker! Ahhh!

18:38.492 --> 18:40.744
You're not wiping
Kellen's ass for me.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.789
You're doing it so that
your baby isn't marinating in shit.

18:43.872 --> 18:44.706
Exactly.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.333
Kim won't even do it.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.794
Oh, no. No. You can't be serious.

18:48.877 --> 18:52.631
Well, she's very triggered by the smell.
It reminds her of her childhood in India.

18:52.714 --> 18:57.219
Bullshit. That is straight-up selfishness.
You have to divorce her today.

18:57.803 --> 18:58.846
What about you, Piper?

19:01.431 --> 19:02.683
-Yeah.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.518
Why don't you tell us about yourself?

19:04.601 --> 19:07.020
All we know about you
is that you're Neri's sister-in-law.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.148
Oh, no. There's not much to tell.

19:09.231 --> 19:14.403
Oh, please. We're desperate
to live vicariously, okay?

19:14.486 --> 19:18.157
So just tell us about all the sex
that you're having. And the drugs.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.909
Well, I haven't done
very many drugs lately,

19:20.993 --> 19:21.994
because I just...

19:22.911 --> 19:23.829
I haven't.

19:23.912 --> 19:27.666
And I haven't been having
very much sex, because my wife is...

19:29.418 --> 19:31.003
I'm in a long-distance relationship.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.046
-Far away.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.300
I've seen her once in the last two months.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.260
-Oh, that's hard.
It is.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.306
It's really hard to be in a relationship
with someone you never see.

19:42.389 --> 19:45.309
And then there's all this pressure
when you finally do see each other.

19:45.392 --> 19:48.395
Exactly! It's like...

19:49.730 --> 19:52.608
I used to hear it if she didn't get
a good night's sleep.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.484
And now I have no idea...

19:56.069 --> 19:57.821
what she's doing or how she's feeling,

19:57.905 --> 20:00.949
and I'm just afraid
she might do something reckless.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.912
Well, did you marry someone
who does reckless things?

20:05.871 --> 20:08.874
When I brought Kellen home,
I would not leave Sasha alone with her.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.667
Right? 'Cause I was so afraid.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.963
I don't know what I was afraid of.
That he'd do something I wouldn't do? But I had to remind myself.
I married someone smart.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.719
And I had to trust his judgment,

20:20.802 --> 20:22.638
even if it wasn't
exactly the way I'd do things.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.850
Who wants a turn nursing Nathan?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.061
-All right, listen up!

20:29.144 --> 20:32.064
A few quick things,
then I'll let you get back to goofing off.

20:32.147 --> 20:35.317
There've been a lot of rumors going around
about the place the last couple days,

20:35.400 --> 20:37.319
and I wanted to set the record straight.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.697
There are gonna be some
administrative changes to the prison.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.283
Interim Warden Figueroa
will be leaving us.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.206
-I didn't hear what he said.
-Also, I wanted to inform you all

20:49.289 --> 20:51.792
that PolyCon is currently
accepting applications

20:51.875 --> 20:53.168
for the position of head guard.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.296
If you'd like to be considered,
there will be a bin in the break room

20:56.380 --> 20:59.174
where you can drop off
your application forms.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.927
Are we to understand
that there will be two head guards?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.305
Not quite.

21:06.890 --> 21:09.393
Hopper. Hopper.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.145
Warden Hopper! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

21:12.229 --> 21:14.314
-I feel like I can accomplish anything!

21:14.398 --> 21:16.858
Okay, all right. Settle down, all right?

21:16.942 --> 21:18.819
Nothing is official yet.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.155
And lastly, if you have any information

21:22.239 --> 21:24.366
regarding the drugs
coming into the prison,

21:24.449 --> 21:26.660
be sure to come directly to me.

21:27.494 --> 21:31.206
I appreciate your assistance
in keeping this place drug-free.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.417
All right? Now back to work

21:33.500 --> 21:36.503
before I make it my first official act
to fire the lot of you!

21:40.090 --> 21:42.467
I don't know about head guard.
Seems like a headache to me.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.679
Comes with a $65K-a-year Aspirin. Not bad.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.431
$25K more than we make now?

21:48.640 --> 21:49.891
$40,000?

21:50.434 --> 21:52.144
Y'all make $8,000 more than me?

21:53.020 --> 21:55.522
Well, it's probably
because I got military experience.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.648
So do I.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.777
Guess you gotta pay a titty tax.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.404
Titty tax.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.116
Ward, can you believe
those guys make $40,000?

22:06.199 --> 22:08.910
-I'm only pulling in $32,000.
-I make $29,500.

22:09.494 --> 22:10.495
Oh.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.498
-That is fucked up.
-Yeah.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.459
We should go to Hopper
and demand equal pay.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.461
Hmm. Tried that last year.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.588
He said I needed to bring something else
to the table.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.174
So I started taking night classes.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.803
"Bring something to the table." Hmm.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.392
Whoo!

22:34.144 --> 22:37.147
What if I let them know
who's smuggling the drugs in here?

22:38.231 --> 22:39.983
That could be something.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.362
It'd make you
a whole lot of enemies, though.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.240
Guys, you don't gotta do this.

22:47.324 --> 22:48.909
No, I read about this in the UCMJ.

22:49.284 --> 22:51.620
When a private first class
has a 21st birthday,

22:51.703 --> 22:54.122
the offending soldier
must submit to be pink-bellied

22:54.206 --> 22:55.707
or face an FG Article 15.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.168
-McCullough, get his shirt.
No.

22:58.251 --> 23:00.420
Sorry.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.922
All right. You're in for it.

23:12.974 --> 23:15.018
All right, all right, all right.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.353
You've earned your gifts.

23:16.728 --> 23:21.483
Jacobs, Rios, show pink-bellied Pena
what he has won.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.196
Booze! And more booze!

23:26.571 --> 23:28.031
And a shit ton of booze!

23:31.118 --> 23:33.662
I got Pena a present, too.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.583
A poem?

23:40.043 --> 23:41.169
Uh, thanks?

23:41.253 --> 23:44.464
-Yeah, thanks for the cash, Grandma.
-Hold on. That's not the present.

23:47.050 --> 23:50.554
Jesus, Grandma, Pena's gonna be 22
by the time this party gets started.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.778
Holy shit!

24:07.696 --> 24:08.947
You didn't!

24:10.407 --> 24:12.576
Oh, baby!

24:14.786 --> 24:15.787
Oh, yeah.

24:16.997 --> 24:20.542
Holy fuckin' shit, McCullough.
You snuck a hajji stripper into camp?

24:20.625 --> 24:22.752
She's actually a Puerto Rican girl
from C Company.

24:23.253 --> 24:25.755
Gave up my whole paycheck
to get her to do this.

24:26.339 --> 24:28.133
-Epic.
-Yeah.

24:29.092 --> 24:33.638
Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!

25:32.155 --> 25:33.240
McCullough.

25:37.118 --> 25:38.078
McCullough?

25:39.913 --> 25:40.997
McCullough.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.982
What the fuck

26:07.065 --> 26:08.441
What the fuck?

26:10.652 --> 26:12.529
Jesus fucking Christ!

26:13.572 --> 26:17.367
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're such a fucking douchebag!

26:18.493 --> 26:19.744
-Fuck.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.875
"I need you to be clever, Bean.

26:25.959 --> 26:29.462
I need you to think of solutions
to problems we haven't seen yet.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.965
I want you to try things
that no one has ever tried

26:32.048 --> 26:34.009
because they're absolutely stupid."

26:34.593 --> 26:38.138
What do you think of that?
Trying stupid solutions?

26:38.221 --> 26:42.559
Mom, do I deserve to be here?

26:44.561 --> 26:45.979
What makes you ask that, honey? Because I don't know.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.989
Do you remember the talk we had
before your trial?

26:56.531 --> 26:58.658
Where we said that you did something
you weren't supposed to,

26:58.742 --> 27:01.870
and Dylan got hurt,
and the judge was going to tell us

27:01.953 --> 27:04.497
how you could make it up
to Dylan's family?

27:06.207 --> 27:08.877
Mmm... But I didn't know.

27:10.920 --> 27:14.341
I-- I didn't know I was kidnapping.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.135
I was just trying to make friends.

27:18.053 --> 27:20.639
And when I reached for him,

27:21.598 --> 27:25.310
I was trying to help him.
I didn't know he was gonna fall.

27:25.393 --> 27:26.811
I know that, Suzanne.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.398
But you think I deserve to be here
for 15 years?

27:31.650 --> 27:33.485
Well, honey, it's complicated.

27:33.568 --> 27:34.861
But it was an accident.

27:35.612 --> 27:38.782
Sometimes, accidents
have legal consequences.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.369
So you do think I deserve to be here.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.371
You deserve to be in a facility

27:44.454 --> 27:46.915
that can help you
with your cognitive difference.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.043
But...

27:51.211 --> 27:53.755
I'm not, Mom.

27:55.882 --> 27:56.925
I'm here.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.516
And I'm asking you,

28:05.517 --> 28:11.106
do you think, if it was an accident
and I didn't mean to do it,

28:12.023 --> 28:15.276
and I'm sorry, was that fair?

28:18.279 --> 28:19.322
Or...

28:20.949 --> 28:23.493
did the judge make a mistake?

28:26.371 --> 28:27.455
No,

28:28.748 --> 28:30.750
you don't deserve to be here.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.337
It's not fair.

28:40.593 --> 28:47.058
And the last theory
is retribuvi...

28:47.684 --> 28:48.768
"Retrivibi..."

28:50.061 --> 28:52.772
"Retribuvitism"?

28:56.484 --> 28:59.195
I was a freakin' warden.
I never said that word.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.282
The retribution,

29:02.365 --> 29:05.076
one basically says
that people who commit crimes

29:05.160 --> 29:07.328
should be punished
because they deserve it.

29:08.329 --> 29:09.414
No other reason.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.668
Uh, theories of...

29:13.752 --> 29:16.796
-All right, I guess you're dismissed.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.799
Don't forget, your paragraphs
on what prison means to you

29:19.883 --> 29:21.551
are due Friday.

29:21.634 --> 29:26.556
Uh, and I want real paragraphs this time.
More than three sentences.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.558
Would you?

29:28.975 --> 29:32.520
He's, like, an older man
who's teaching me things, so obviously.

29:33.813 --> 29:36.608
Mr. Caputo, can we talk for a sec?

29:36.691 --> 29:39.319
I gotta go cook dinner,
feed the beast that is my girlfriend.

29:39.402 --> 29:40.904
But walk with me.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.199
How am I doing?

29:45.575 --> 29:46.451
Be honest.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.286
Uh, it's--
it's getting better, definitely.

29:48.369 --> 29:51.706
I'm not sure the overhead projector thing
is connecting, though.

29:52.665 --> 29:55.418
Right. No, that's good.
That's good feedback.

29:55.502 --> 29:58.713
I'll check with a few other students,
see if they feel the same way

29:58.797 --> 30:00.340
before I start messing with the formula.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.674
I wanted to talk to you

30:01.758 --> 30:04.052
because the head guard position
is opening up,

30:04.135 --> 30:06.387
and I'm thinking of going for it.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.306
I think it's a great idea.

30:09.182 --> 30:12.977
Um, they're getting one of the higher-ups
from corporate to do interviews.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.524
Yeah, got any tips?

30:17.899 --> 30:21.069
Yeah, don't say her name three times
in a dark bathroom.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.782
-She's what you'd call a soulless bitch.
-Hmm.

30:25.865 --> 30:26.991
And she wears a wig.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.535
Anything useful?

30:28.618 --> 30:30.995
Sorry.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.457
Uh, Linda only cares
about the bottom line.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.793
Her favorite phrase is "status quo."

30:36.876 --> 30:39.629
So long as you tell her
you'll maintain the status quo

30:39.712 --> 30:42.382
while cutting costs, you're golden.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.760
Toe the company line.
Don't make any waves.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.512
You're gonna do great. Thanks. For the advice.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.141
And it's "retributivism!"

30:52.725 --> 30:54.602
"Tivism," not "vitism."

30:54.978 --> 30:56.020
Huh.

31:02.110 --> 31:06.739
Where the fuck did you come from?

31:06.823 --> 31:08.741
-I just ruined you for life.
-Mmm.

31:09.325 --> 31:12.203
I think you might be right. I'm sprung.

31:12.287 --> 31:15.790
I can tell. The way you were cumming
like a junior high schooler and shit.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.671
How is it possible I never saw you
at that club before?

31:21.754 --> 31:23.464
You wasn't looking hard enough.

31:23.548 --> 31:26.885
No way. I come to New York a lot
during the off-season.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.553
It's weird I never saw you.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.055
Well, I-- I been in Ohio.

31:33.474 --> 31:35.268
What part? I got cousins there.

31:35.351 --> 31:38.521
-I've been traveling, too. So...
-Hmm.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.440
-Yep.
-Shit!

31:43.526 --> 31:45.445
Oh, shit. I'm late for a meeting.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.281
As soon as I get back,
we'll plan some traveling, too.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.200
Buying you a ticket to visit me in LA.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.545
Uh, can I think about it?

32:05.256 --> 32:06.132
For real?

32:09.135 --> 32:11.095
Wow.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.643
Wow. Oh, wow.

32:17.518 --> 32:18.561
Man.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.316
<i>You saw him again, didn't you?</i>

32:23.399 --> 32:24.609
Bitch, I never left.

32:24.692 --> 32:30.531
Oh, my God! You have to tell him
to focus on his midrange game.

32:30.615 --> 32:31.950
An explosive first step

32:32.033 --> 32:34.035
<i>with a decent pull-up</i>
<i>could really help us out--</i>

32:34.118 --> 32:36.412
Daisy! Stop talking about boring things.

32:37.163 --> 32:40.083
Okay, I need you to tell me that it's okay
for me to go visit him in LA.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.126
But you can't leave the state.

32:42.502 --> 32:44.295
But I like him so much.

32:44.379 --> 32:47.131
<i>I'm having feelings</i>
<i>I haven't had in a long time.</i>

32:47.215 --> 32:49.801
This is the first time I've felt
like a real person since I got out.

32:49.884 --> 32:51.594
<i>Parole, Zaza!</i>

32:51.678 --> 32:53.638
They randomly check up on you, right?

32:53.721 --> 32:57.141
If you're not where you're supposed to be,
they could send you back, right?

32:57.225 --> 33:00.937
I-- I know. I know that.
But can't I have a weekend where I just...

33:01.020 --> 33:02.730
Where I don't feel like
a fucking criminal?

33:02.814 --> 33:05.650
Like, I already did my time, okay?
I deserve a weekend away with him.

33:05.733 --> 33:07.151
Look, I gotta go.

33:07.235 --> 33:10.613
If I'm not in the office before
Dr. Maslov, he asks for a hug.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.365
And he's handsy.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.534
<i>Don't do anything stupid, girl.</i>

33:21.666 --> 33:24.919
So, I heard you went to
this Tony Robbins seminar.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.129
Fuckin' yeah, I did.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.924
Still not used to
that whole swearing thing.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.928
All right. Well, I'll tell you
what I like about that Tony,

33:34.012 --> 33:39.308
since we agree that he is definitely not
a huckster snake-oil salesman.

33:39.392 --> 33:42.687
I like when he calls the people
in the audience pussies.

33:42.770 --> 33:44.981
It's like he's seen their pussies before.

33:57.243 --> 33:59.746
There's no fucking names on any of these.

34:14.218 --> 34:15.470
Come on.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.604
Drop the knife and the baggie now, inmate.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.068
-It's just a butter knife.
-Down on the floor.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.031
Hellman, he's trying to force me
to sell drugs for him.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.699
I was just trying to put it in his locker

34:36.783 --> 34:38.743
-so I didn't get caught with it.
-Down.

34:38.826 --> 34:40.369
Please. You have to help me.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.289
What do you think I'm doing in here?
I don't want this.

34:43.372 --> 34:44.415
I was gonna bring it to administration,

34:44.499 --> 34:47.752
but I knew that nobody would listen.
Please. Please.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.672
I can't get more time.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.341
I'm not going to ask you again.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.527
It's not for me to decide.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.591
Looking for someone?

35:39.679 --> 35:42.640
-Better view.

35:42.723 --> 35:45.852
You'd be surprised what you can get
in return for good hooch in here.

35:46.185 --> 35:48.146
Try some while I bend your ear.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.904
My father's recipe.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.741
-Nah, I'm good.

36:03.452 --> 36:05.037
It will help with your nerves.

36:09.125 --> 36:12.170
I tell people I'm from Lagos,
but I'm really from Ibadan,

36:12.253 --> 36:14.672
which is a transportation hub
a few hours north.

36:14.755 --> 36:18.176
It's a bit like saying you're from Chicago
when you're really from Peoria.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.136
I got a cousin who do that.

36:20.219 --> 36:22.722
You can't say you from the Bronx
when you from Mount Vernon.

36:22.805 --> 36:25.850
My father was a leader of
the Transport Road Workers Union there,

36:25.933 --> 36:27.351
and in a place like Ibadan,

36:27.435 --> 36:29.520
where politicians bring weapons
to the assembly,

36:29.604 --> 36:31.814
a union leader must be clever.

36:31.898 --> 36:35.318
He must know whose hand to shake
and whose to chop off at the wrist.

36:35.651 --> 36:37.153
Sounds like your pops was a G.

36:37.236 --> 36:39.197
He taught me to see things clearly.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.949
But he would be disappointed in me.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.410
Because it took me too long
to see you clearly.

36:45.786 --> 36:46.913
What is that supposed to mean?

36:46.996 --> 36:49.123
Taking out your girlfriend
was a dangerous move.

36:50.625 --> 36:51.792
It was also smart.

36:52.585 --> 36:56.547
Daddy took all the credit,
but you were bringing the powder in.

36:57.256 --> 36:59.217
So what

36:59.300 --> 37:01.844
I'm saying that if you're now gonna go
after the crown,

37:01.928 --> 37:04.805
Annalisa and the others,
they aren't simply gonna let you take it.

37:05.431 --> 37:06.807
You're gonna need help.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.727
We could run this place.

37:11.729 --> 37:14.273
Maybe. But I don't know you like that.

37:14.357 --> 37:18.694
Well, sometimes you have to take
the leap and see if a net will appear.

37:23.449 --> 37:25.117
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

37:27.119 --> 37:28.120
Mmm-hmm.

37:30.039 --> 37:33.209
So tell me,
why should we hire you as head guard?

37:39.715 --> 37:40.925
Can you rephrase the question?

37:47.056 --> 37:51.477
Um, I'm not sure how to do that.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.271
<i> You're afraid, aren't you?</i>

37:54.397 --> 37:57.942
Afraid to meet your own greatness.

37:58.025 --> 38:03.030
Well, everyone's afraid, Linda.
It's what you do with that fear--

38:03.114 --> 38:05.366
I ask it to leave my office.

38:05.866 --> 38:08.786
I find you unsettling. Please leave.

38:08.869 --> 38:12.748
Obviously
setting aside the M490 Maglock,

38:12.832 --> 38:16.168
which we can talk about if you want,
but setting that aside,

38:16.252 --> 38:18.087
I'll say I've noticed a slight difference

38:18.170 --> 38:21.632
between the delayed relock of the RCI 8310

38:21.716 --> 38:25.261
-and the 3101C series.
-Mmm-hmm.

38:25.344 --> 38:28.764
Now don't get me wrong,
sometimes you gotta be a little forceful.

38:29.390 --> 38:33.394
But you start from a place
of caring, respect, dignity.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.938
That "do unto others" type of stuff.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.773
-That sounds very thoughtful.
-Hmm.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.822
You know, it might be nice

38:44.905 --> 38:49.702
to fill the position
with someone of your background.

38:49.785 --> 38:52.538
-Sure. Mmm-hmm.

38:52.621 --> 38:56.042
That's great, 'cause I'd really like
to overhaul the whole system.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.253
Scorched-earth.
Sweeping personnel changes.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.629
It won't be cheap, but--

39:00.713 --> 39:04.008
I've heard enough.
You can find your way out.

39:08.054 --> 39:11.974
I've been taking night classes in
corrections management for the past year,

39:12.058 --> 39:14.894
and I'm confident
that I can run a tight ship,

39:14.977 --> 39:18.522
keeping costs down while making sure
that the prison remains safe

39:18.814 --> 39:21.025
in a way that honors the PolyCon brand.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.444
That sounds very status quo.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.739
Now, I understand why you think
we should hire you,

39:26.822 --> 39:30.409
but I'm curious, why do you want this job?

39:31.243 --> 39:32.203
Uh...

39:36.207 --> 39:38.209
One of my teachers
asked me to write a paper

39:38.292 --> 39:40.169
about what prison means to me.

39:41.128 --> 39:44.965
And at first I thought it was
kind of a stupid topic, but...

39:46.342 --> 39:51.764
when I really thought about it,
I realized that prison is an opportunity.

39:53.516 --> 39:55.768
We get people when they're
at their lowest point,

39:55.851 --> 39:58.771
which means maybe they'd be
willing to try something new.

39:59.313 --> 40:04.360
To change. And I wanna be part
of what helps them change for the better.

40:07.446 --> 40:10.783
You can look at some of these girls
and see they're hungry for it.

40:12.326 --> 40:15.621
The majority of them are decent people.
They just want a chance to show it to you.

40:16.747 --> 40:20.459
In the classes,
they call what we do a "public good."

40:21.627 --> 40:25.047
Then I figure we owe it to the public
to do something good. It's in the name.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.092
And it doesn't have to cost
a lot of money.

40:29.468 --> 40:32.721
Then let's do the public best!
At a low price point.

40:32.805 --> 40:33.639
Sure.

40:34.306 --> 40:37.893
Gosh, you are so well-spoken
but not strident.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.186
Did you grow up in the church?

40:40.604 --> 40:42.815
-Yeah, I went to church sometimes.
-It shows.

40:43.899 --> 40:49.488
And I just love the way your hair looks.
It's so...

40:51.157 --> 40:55.828
Don't poop, just sleep.
Just sleep.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.419
Hello?

41:03.502 --> 41:04.670
<i>An inmate from Litchfield Federal Prison</i>

41:04.753 --> 41:05.588
<i>is attempting to contact you.</i>

41:05.671 --> 41:08.174
-Accept, accept, accept!
<i>-To accept the--</i>

41:10.551 --> 41:12.261
Hi. Alex?

41:12.344 --> 41:16.182
<i>Piper? I'm sorry I didn't...</i>
<i>I'm sorry I didn't call.</i>

41:16.265 --> 41:18.476
Uh, can you speak up?
I'm having trouble hearing you.

41:18.809 --> 41:22.521
I'm sorry I didn't call. It's, um...

41:24.398 --> 41:25.316
<i>Hello?</i>

41:25.399 --> 41:30.446
It's just been, like,
a rough couple of days.

41:30.529 --> 41:32.114
What's going on

41:32.198 --> 41:34.533
<i>I wanna tell you, but it's just-- It's...</i>

41:34.617 --> 41:37.536
It's hard with all these
fucking people around.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.498
<i>Alex, you have to tell me what's going on.</i>

41:40.581 --> 41:43.375
It's gonna be impossible to do this
if you won't talk to me.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.878
I am all alone out here and...

41:51.425 --> 41:53.928
You know what? Actually...

41:56.680 --> 41:57.806
don't tell me. I trust you.

42:02.102 --> 42:08.651
I know I married a smart woman
who is capable of handling herself.

42:08.734 --> 42:13.405
And if you don't wanna tell me, I'm sure
that you have a very good reason for it.

42:13.489 --> 42:16.951
I love you, Alex.

42:21.497 --> 42:23.040
I love you, too.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.044
And I promise
I'll tell you everything soon.

42:27.419 --> 42:31.048
But can you just tell me
about things with you?

42:31.131 --> 42:33.342
'Cause I could really use a distraction.

42:33.425 --> 42:38.097
Well, um, I started babysitting.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.014
Yeah?

42:39.098 --> 42:42.142
Yeah, and it's making me think
I don't want children.

42:43.352 --> 42:45.104
Does that make me a bad person?

42:45.187 --> 42:48.274
No, it doesn't make you a bad person.

42:48.357 --> 42:51.068
<i>But who's going to take care of us</i>
<i>in our old age? </i>

42:51.819 --> 42:55.364
A dog? A very capable dog. A robot dog.

42:55.447 --> 42:58.492
<i>-A robot dog. That could be the answer.</i>

43:00.369 --> 43:02.913
And that top she was wearing, that was...

43:04.832 --> 43:05.666
fitted.

43:05.749 --> 43:08.460
But I made it the whole interview
without looking at her jagungas.

43:08.544 --> 43:09.837
Rookie move.

43:09.920 --> 43:13.007
Always make a point of looking
at the tatas once, but only once,

43:13.090 --> 43:16.176
so she knows you respect her,
but you would still definitely bang her.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.262
Well, I hope you boys didn't disappoint,

43:18.345 --> 43:21.849
'cause I told corporate that you two
were my top picks for the job.

43:23.559 --> 43:25.978
-You three.
-I fucking owned that interview.

43:26.061 --> 43:30.065
Yeah, you mighta owned it,
but I fucked it in the donk like...

43:33.944 --> 43:36.363
Well, I was in
the interview's guts, like...

43:36.447 --> 43:40.326
"You don't get to cum yet.
I tell you when you get to cum."

43:40.409 --> 43:43.746
No, no, but I had to back off a little bit
because of how big my dick is.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.706
-It just fuckin'...
-Yeah, you gotta back off! -I also had sex with the interview.

43:49.877 --> 43:53.339
Stop it.
-It's the interview.

43:54.423 --> 43:56.425
It looks like
he's humping a cantaloupe.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.565
Come on, McCullough.

45:02.241 --> 45:03.659
Whoa, whoa!

45:03.742 --> 45:06.912
McCullough! Is there anything
I can help you with? Or...

45:17.423 --> 45:19.133
You guys
sleep it off all right?

45:21.927 --> 45:23.303
Great party, huh?

45:29.184 --> 45:32.020
Hey, Pena. What the fuck is wrong
with Rios and Jacobs?

45:32.104 --> 45:34.523
Maybe they think you'll accuse them
of some bullshit.

45:37.276 --> 45:38.694
All right, load up!

45:42.990 --> 45:45.492
Hey, tell them the truth
about what happened.

45:45.576 --> 45:46.869
Don't fucking talk to me.

45:46.952 --> 45:49.371
I just spent an hour in the lieutenant's
office 'cause of your shit.

45:49.913 --> 45:51.290
You're lucky he understood.

45:51.915 --> 45:54.626
Tell them what you really did,
or I will tell them.

45:54.710 --> 45:56.712
Say whatever you want.
They won't believe you.

46:15.939 --> 46:17.274
Let's move!

46:26.241 --> 46:27.534
What the fuck?

46:27.618 --> 46:29.369
Contact! Right!

46:29.453 --> 46:30.454
Take cover!
What the fuck?

46:41.507 --> 46:43.217
Let's go, Warren. Keep it moving.

46:55.354 --> 46:56.939
I don't deserve to be here, you know.

46:57.022 --> 46:58.190
Neither do I.

47:02.402 --> 47:05.447
Wait. This one doesn't have a dessert.

47:11.453 --> 47:13.247
This one doesn't have a dessert either.

47:17.751 --> 47:21.630
-And this one doesn't have one either!
<i>-</i>Calm down. They must have run out.

47:23.131 --> 47:28.095
But everyone else got a dessert.
So they should all have dessert.

47:28.178 --> 47:29.388
It's not fair.

47:29.471 --> 47:34.476
I mean, why would you only have
some of them that do not have a dessert?

47:35.352 --> 47:36.186
Huh?

47:36.854 --> 47:42.109
It doesn't make sense.
They should all have a fucking dessert!

47:45.571 --> 47:46.446
Fuck!

47:47.072 --> 47:50.450
-Oh, man--
-No, you shut up, Ethel!

47:51.034 --> 47:55.581
Warren, you can't take
everybody's pudding cup like that.

47:55.664 --> 47:56.957
Why not?

47:59.293 --> 48:01.086
What are you gonna do about it?

48:02.629 --> 48:04.590
Well, I'm gonna give you a shot.

48:10.929 --> 48:11.847
Go ahead.

48:22.608 --> 48:25.444
Hey, you medium cocks
still up for drinks tonight?

48:25.527 --> 48:26.987
-Fuck yes.
-Yes, sir.

48:27.070 --> 48:28.488
You guys getting drinks tonight?

48:29.281 --> 48:30.115
Sort of.

48:30.824 --> 48:33.201
Don't forget to invite Dixon.

48:35.787 --> 48:38.290
Yo. Just got an email from corporate.

48:38.373 --> 48:39.291
Hello?

48:39.374 --> 48:43.003
Uh, "We thank you for your interest,
but we regret to inform you that..."

48:43.086 --> 48:44.504
Motherfuck!

48:45.839 --> 48:46.673
Hellman?

48:47.257 --> 48:50.177
Same fucking email.
Even though I did the tit check.

48:51.094 --> 48:52.387
It seems...

48:57.809 --> 48:59.603
I was rejected as well.

49:02.022 --> 49:04.775
Let me guess, Ward.
You're the new head guard.

49:04.858 --> 49:09.112
No, I'm the new warden.

49:23.418 --> 49:24.878
That's weird.

49:25.462 --> 49:31.385
Because, remember, you said that you were
gonna be the new warden, Hopper.

49:33.595 --> 49:36.139
Remember? You called a meeting...

49:37.599 --> 49:39.893
and then you said it
in front of everybody.

49:42.688 --> 49:43.855
We were all there.

49:51.238 --> 49:53.907
I believe you.
What you said about Hellman.

49:54.950 --> 49:58.662
So I'm giving you two options for
what I can do with this incident report.

49:59.371 --> 50:02.332
I can turn it in,
you blame Hellman, no one cares.

50:02.916 --> 50:06.128
You get five more years
where he makes your life a nightmare.

50:06.211 --> 50:09.715
Or I can rip it up,
you start selling for me.

50:10.465 --> 50:12.759
And you get five percent more
than he was giving you.

50:15.137 --> 50:16.221
What about Hellman?

50:16.304 --> 50:18.432
You're smart. You'll figure something out.

50:20.058 --> 50:21.643
That's what the five percent is for.

50:39.786 --> 50:42.998
You see, white women,
they always stick together.

50:44.166 --> 50:49.379
They only respect who they fear.
So let's make them fear you.

50:52.424 --> 50:56.678
Eeny, meeny, miny...

50:56.762 --> 51:00.724
Oh, shit! Fuckin' Diaz crawled out
of her hole. Better watch yourself.

51:04.728 --> 51:05.604
...moe?

51:09.066 --> 51:11.234
Hey, can I ask you something?

51:11.860 --> 51:18.241
Ward "Warden Ward."
It even sounds ridiculous.

51:18.325 --> 51:20.869
You don't think they gave it to her
because she's a black?

51:20.952 --> 51:22.954
Oh, definitely. No question at all.

51:23.747 --> 51:25.499
If they were gonna go most qualified,

51:25.582 --> 51:28.877
no one knows what's happening
in this prison better than--

51:29.961 --> 51:31.713
What?
What the fuck?

51:43.016 --> 51:45.227
Inmate down in cell block D!

51:49.022 --> 51:50.649
What the fuck y'all looking at?

52:02.953 --> 52:04.204
Oh, my God.

52:15.090 --> 52:17.300
It's almost like we went to LA, right?

52:17.843 --> 52:20.887
-No, it's like I went to Bushwick.

52:20.971 --> 52:23.640
Cheer up, girl. You did the right thing.

52:23.723 --> 52:26.643
Better than ending up back in prison.
He'll be back.

52:26.726 --> 52:30.063
No, he won't. He's an NBA player in LA.

52:30.147 --> 52:31.940
And you're the ass-shaking queen.

52:32.023 --> 52:36.194
He'll be back, Zaza. I know it.
And you'll be just as in love then.

52:36.778 --> 52:37.821
What's up with the bouncer?

52:37.904 --> 52:39.656
Ew. That's not
the kind of cheering up I need.

52:39.739 --> 52:41.158
No, look.

52:41.241 --> 52:43.118
Up against the wall,
right now!

52:44.494 --> 52:45.412
Identification!

52:48.248 --> 52:50.000
I want to see identification.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.376
-Shit. I don't have my ID.
Up against the wall.

52:54.087 --> 52:55.755
Hands on the wall.
Hands on the wall.

52:58.383 --> 53:00.302
No, no, no! I'm American!

53:02.429 --> 53:05.223
No. I'm a-- I'm a--
I'm an American. I'm a US citizen.

53:06.057 --> 53:08.059
Identification! Get it out!

53:13.982 --> 53:15.483
I'm an American. Please.

53:15.567 --> 53:18.570
You have to believe me.
This is a mistake. Sir?

53:18.653 --> 53:20.530
Come on now. Not up to me.
