I'm Seth Weitberg,

<i>You've got Californios</i>

You've got Germans.

<i>You've got French.</i>

<i>You've got Jews.</i>

02:15.836 --> 02:16.869
<i>But there's no police force.</i>

02:16.871 --> 02:20.405
<i>And one of the guys that</i>
<i>shows up is Benjamin Hayes.</i>

02:20.407 --> 02:21.807
<i>He's a lawyer, and he's like,</i>

02:21.809 --> 02:23.342
<i>Hey, guys, don't sweat it.</i>

02:23.344 --> 02:24.276
<i>I know American law.</i>

02:24.278 --> 02:25.277
<i>Like, I can help you out, okay.</i>

<i>And he becomes the first ever</i>

<i>And he's like,</i>
<i>I hope we have a good jail.</i>

02:31.785 --> 02:32.651
<i>And someone's like,</i>

02:32.653 --> 02:35.420
<i>Actually, it's just</i>

<i>Why don't we all give</i>
<i>a little bit of money,</i>

02:47.835 --> 02:48.767
<i>we'll hire a police force,</i>

02:48.769 --> 02:50.469
<i>and we can be in control of</i>
<i>them and tell them what to do.</i>

02:50.471 --> 02:53.972

<i>are like, Law enforcement?</i>

03:25.739 --> 03:26.738
<i>Should we bring anything?</i>

03:26.740 --> 03:28.207
<i>I mean, it's nice</i>
<i>to bring something.</i>

03:28.209 --> 03:32.010
And they show up
with a cannon!

in that moment,

03:42.690 --> 03:45.257
<i>[bleep] the law,</i>
<i>[bleep] Benjamin Hayes,</i>

03:45.259 --> 03:46.291

<i>[bleep] California,</i>

<i>You're stupid as [bleep]</i>

<i>for bringing a cannon.</i>

03:52.633 --> 03:56.435
<i>And I have a pistol,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna kill you.</i>

03:56.437 --> 03:57.236
<i>Bang-bang-bang!</i>

03:57.238 --> 04:00.572
<i>Hayes is like, No-no-no-no-</i>
<i>no-no-no-no-no-no!</i>

04:00.574 --> 04:02.708
<i>And everyone else is like,</i>

04:02.710 --> 04:03.875
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

04:03.877 --> 04:06.178
They don't think
that's a bad idea.

04:06.180 --> 04:07.913
Instead they think,

04:07.915 --> 04:10.282
<i>That's a good idea.</i>

04:10.284 --> 04:12.184
<i>And Andres Pico's like,</i>
<i>[bleep] right.</i>

04:12.186 --> 04:14.786
<i>Let's form a commi--</i>
<i>a vigilance committee.</i>

04:14.788 --> 04:17.389
<i>And he forms a vig--he forms</i>
<i>this vigilance committee.</i>

04:17.391 --> 04:19.558
<i>And they're like,</i>
<i>Hey, let's sit around.</i>

04:19.560 --> 04:23.362
<i>Let's, like, figure out,</i>
<i>like, who did a bad thing.</i>

04:23.364 --> 04:25.731
If they did a bad thing,
let's get them.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.199
And someone comes
in the vigilance committee.

04:27.201 --> 04:29.935
<i>They're like, Hey, there's</i>
<i>a couple murderers in the jail</i>

04:29.937 --> 04:31.069
<i>that we--that just escaped.</i>

04:31.071 --> 04:33.305
<i>Pico, like, chases down</i>
<i>these two murderers.</i>

04:33.307 --> 04:34.206
<i>Boom-boom-boom!</i>

04:34.208 --> 04:35.107
<i>[bleep] kills them.</i>

04:35.109 --> 04:37.876
<i>And the L.A. Star,</i>
<i>the first newspaper in L.A.,</i>

04:37.878 --> 04:40.112
<i>they're like, Form posses.</i>

04:40.114 --> 04:41.913
<i>This is a great idea.</i>

04:41.915 --> 04:42.948
<i>Get the bad guys.</i>

04:42.950 --> 04:45.317
<i>And everybody's like,</i>
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

04:45.319 --> 04:47.019
<i>We should form a posse!</i>

04:47.021 --> 04:51.690
And hanging fever
breaks out in Los Angeles.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.959
<i>Everyone's like,</i>
<i>Oh, you're vandalizing</i>

04:53.961 --> 04:55.160

<i>Hayes is like, The vigilance</i>
<i>committee has gone too far.</i>

05:15.816 --> 05:18.183
<i>I'm going to issue a warrant</i>

05:18.185 --> 05:21.053
<i>to arrest these vigilantes.</i>

05:21.055 --> 05:22.854
<i>No one's ever heard</i>
<i>of vigilantes,</i>

05:22.856 --> 05:24.523
<i>but they're called vigilantes.</i>

05:24.525 --> 05:25.457
<i>I'm making up this term.</i>

05:25.459 --> 05:29.294
Judge Hayes goes out
to the homes of the vigilantes.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.396
<i>And he's like, I have a warrant</i>
<i>for your arrest</i>

05:31.398 --> 05:32.497
<i>because you're vigilantes.</i>

05:32.499 --> 05:36.702
<i>And they're like,</i>
<i>Well, in that case...</i>

05:36.704 --> 05:40.339
<i>[weakly]</i>
<i>I'm gonna stay in my house.</i>

05:40.341 --> 05:41.707
<i>I'm gonna stay in my house.</i>

<i>And he's like, Aw, man.</i>

05:42.843 --> 05:44.876
<i>I wish these people would just</i>
<i>come out of their house</i>

05:44.878 --> 05:49.348
<i>so I could try them in a jury</i>
<i>with a trial.</i>

05:49.350 --> 05:53.185
There's no police force!

05:53.187 --> 05:55.554

05:57.925 --> 05:59.458

05:59.460 --> 06:00.325
- The boom.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.093
Bo dropped the boom.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.095
- By the way, I have to pee

06:03.097 --> 06:05.664
But I'm gonna finish this story,
and then I'm gonna pee,

06:05.666 --> 06:07.466

good times, great oldies.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.936

<i>Mm, I think we went too far.</i>

06:40.868 --> 06:42.167
<i>And Andres Pico is like,</i>

<i>I just beheaded so many dudes.</i>

06:44.471 --> 06:45.404
<i>You know what?</i>

06:45.406 --> 06:47.706
<i>The better way for me is,</i>

06:47.708 --> 06:50.275
<i>I'm gonna go</i>
<i>into the state senate.</i>

06:50.277 --> 06:51.777

06:51.779 --> 06:52.744
<i>That's the way to do it.</i>

<i>Gandhi, MLK, you know,</i>
<i>that's how we do it.</i>

06:56.417 --> 06:58.917

<i>the people of Los Angeles</i>
<i>finally say,</i>

07:01.355 --> 07:03.855

<i>and have a police force.</i>

07:05.159 --> 07:06.024
<i>And Judge Hayes is like,</i>

<i>That's what I asked for</i>
<i>in 1852, you [bleep] doofuses.</i>

<i>that is where the LAPD</i>
<i>comes from.</i>

07:44.932 --> 07:46.031
Oh, okay.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.599
I didn't know
that was happening again.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.468

Hello, I'm Eric Edelstein,

08:03.250 --> 08:06.418
and today we're gonna
tell the story of Rin Tin Tin,

08:06.420 --> 08:09.087
Hollywood's first superstar.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.122
<i>Our story starts in 1898.</i>

08:11.124 --> 08:12.824
<i>Lee Duncan is sent</i>
<i>to an orphanage.</i>

08:12.826 --> 08:16.094
<i>He's like, Dude, Mom,</i>
<i>you're dropping me off?</i>

08:16.096 --> 08:17.529
<i>And his mom is like,</i>

08:17.531 --> 08:19.331
<i>Don't worry, it's fine.</i>

08:19.333 --> 08:20.198
<i>That's the deal.</i>

08:20.200 --> 08:22.868
<i>And he's like, Man,</i>
<i>all I want is one friend.</i>

08:22.870 --> 08:24.803
<i>All I need in this life</i>
<i>is one friend,</i>

08:24.805 --> 08:26.571
<i>because he never had</i>
<i>anything, man.</i>

08:26.573 --> 08:28.039
Well, then World War I happens.

08:28.041 --> 08:32.077
<i>Lee Duncan is sent out</i>
<i>to a part of France,</i>

08:32.079 --> 08:34.246
<i>and he hears something.</i>

08:34.248 --> 08:35.881
<i>He's like, Holy [bleep].</i>

08:35.883 --> 08:36.982
<i>What's that sound?</i>

08:36.984 --> 08:38.016
<i>It's like...</i>

08:38.018 --> 08:41.353
[whimpering]

08:41.921 --> 08:43.355
You know that sound, huh?

08:43.357 --> 08:47.058
<i>He sees a German shepherd</i>
<i>covering five puppies.</i>

08:47.060 --> 08:51.763
<i>There were 16 million</i>
<i>animal soldiers in World War I.</i>

08:51.765 --> 08:52.931
<i>And gives a way the mother</i>

08:52.933 --> 08:54.199
<i>to somebody</i>
<i>who wants the mother.</i>

08:54.201 --> 08:56.034
<i>And he gives away</i>
<i>all the puppies but two.</i>

08:56.036 --> 09:00.305
<i>And he's like, I'm gonna name</i>
<i>you Rin Tin Tin and Nanette.</i>

09:00.307 --> 09:01.540
<i>You just booked.</i>

09:01.542 --> 09:02.974
- Cheers.

09:06.779 --> 09:09.648
- Ah, that's got a good taste.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.615
<i>So the war eventually ends,</i>

09:10.617 --> 09:14.586
<i>and then Nanette gets very</i>
<i>sick, and Nanette passes away.</i>

09:14.588 --> 09:16.021
<i>And so all he has</i>
<i>is Rin Tin Tin,</i>

09:16.023 --> 09:17.756
<i>and so he wasn't sure</i>
<i>what he was gonna do.</i>

09:17.758 --> 09:21.893
<i>But he knew it was gonna</i>
<i>somehow involve Rin Tin Tin.</i>

09:21.895 --> 09:23.328
<i>Only problem,</i>

09:23.330 --> 09:24.362
a newspaper boy,

09:24.364 --> 09:26.197
some Bennie Arthur type asshole,

09:26.199 --> 09:30.569
<i>comes by, throws a stack</i>
<i>of newspapers,</i>

09:30.571 --> 09:34.005
<i>and nails Rin Tin Tin</i>
<i>in the leg.</i>

09:34.007 --> 09:35.040
<i>And somebody says,</i>

09:35.042 --> 09:36.808
<i>This is a time where if your</i>
<i>dog's leg</i>

09:36.810 --> 09:37.976
<i>breaks in four places,</i>

09:37.978 --> 09:40.512
<i>unfortunately it's gonna</i>
<i>have to be probably put down.</i>

09:40.514 --> 09:42.547
<i>You get gangrene,</i>
<i>you get some weird [bleep].</i>

09:42.549 --> 09:46.551
<i>So he said, Man, this dog's leg</i>
<i>is broken in four places.</i>

09:46.553 --> 09:49.054
<i>The vet's told me</i>
<i>it's gonna take nine months.</i>

09:49.056 --> 09:51.323
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

09:51.325 --> 09:53.191
<i>Dude, I'm gonna train it.</i>

09:53.193 --> 09:55.260
<i>And magic's gonna happen.</i>

09:55.262 --> 09:57.195
<i>Lee trains him to sit.</i>

09:57.197 --> 09:58.530
<i>Lee trains him to fetch.</i>

09:58.532 --> 09:59.931
<i>Lee trains him to run.</i>

09:59.933 --> 10:03.101
This dog is doing something
that is amazing.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.471
<i>So he brings Rin Tin Tin</i>
<i>to the Pasadena Dog Show,</i>

10:06.473 --> 10:08.440
<i>and his friend Charlie Jones</i>
<i>comes along.</i>

10:08.442 --> 10:10.208
<i>He's like, Hey,</i>
<i>want to do something?</i>

10:10.210 --> 10:11.409
<i>What about your dog there?</i>

10:11.411 --> 10:12.344
<i>Your dog's pretty cool.</i>

10:12.346 --> 10:14.179
<i>Maybe we can make him jump.</i>

10:14.181 --> 10:18.183
<i>And then they set up</i>
<i>an 11-foot, 8-foot jump.</i>

10:18.185 --> 10:20.785
11-foot, 8-inch jump.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.954
<i>He looked at Rin Tin Tin,</i>
<i>and he's like,</i>

10:22.956 --> 10:24.356
<i>Dude, this is your chance.</i>

10:24.358 --> 10:26.324
<i>I feel like fate and</i>
<i>circumstance</i>

10:26.326 --> 10:28.126
<i>has placed us here.</i>

10:28.128 --> 10:28.893
<i>You just got to jump.</i>

10:28.895 --> 10:31.429
<i>You got to jump like you never</i>
<i>jumped before, okay, dude?</i>

10:31.431 --> 10:33.498
<i>So he was like,</i>
<i>Yep, I'll jump.</i>

10:33.500 --> 10:36.034
<i>And Rin Tin Tin jumped it.</i>

10:36.036 --> 10:38.436
<i>Lee sees Rin Tin Tin jumping.</i>

10:38.438 --> 10:39.871
<i>He says, Holy [bleep], movies.</i>

10:39.873 --> 10:42.674
<i>This is--yeah, this is</i>
<i>what Rin Tin Tin</i>

10:42.676 --> 10:43.541
<i>is supposed to do.</i>

10:43.543 --> 10:44.909
<i>And then they say Rin Tin Tin--</i>

10:44.911 --> 10:46.177
[clattering]

10:46.179 --> 10:47.512
Thank God you dropped that.

10:47.514 --> 10:49.948
I had no idea
where I was going.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.249
<i>It was amazing.</i>

10:51.251 --> 10:52.150
So, basically...

10:52.152 --> 10:52.951
[beer can pops open]

10:52.953 --> 10:54.452
<i>Lee Duncan goes</i>
<i>over the Warner Brothers.</i>

10:54.454 --> 10:56.888
<i>So this guy literally</i>
<i>went to the gates</i>

10:56.890 --> 10:59.324
<i>and started doing tricks</i>
<i>with Rin Tin Tin.</i>

10:59.326 --> 11:01.192
<i>Harry Warner saw it,</i>
<i>and he's like,</i>

11:01.194 --> 11:02.193
<i>Look at that dog jump.</i>

11:02.195 --> 11:03.128
<i>That dog's pretty good.</i>

11:03.130 --> 11:05.630
<i>I'd be interested in what</i>
<i>that dog might be offering.</i>

11:05.632 --> 11:06.898
<i>Some producer comes out,</i>
<i>he's like,</i>

11:06.900 --> 11:08.166
<i>Yeah, you know,</i>
<i>we got a wolf movie,</i>

11:08.168 --> 11:09.467
<i>but we could use,</i>
<i>like, an extra.</i>

11:09.469 --> 11:11.336
<i>He'll be buried</i>
<i>in the background.</i>

11:11.338 --> 11:12.404
<i>So he came in.</i>

11:12.406 --> 11:13.238
The wolf they had--

11:13.240 --> 11:14.372
they had a real goddamn wolf.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.941
<i>When it came time,</i>
<i>when the lights was on,</i>

11:16.943 --> 11:17.776
<i>the wolf sucked,</i>

11:17.778 --> 11:20.145
<i>so they couldn't get</i>
<i>this wolf to do the tricks.</i>

11:20.147 --> 11:22.380
<i>So Lee jumped up and said,</i>

11:22.382 --> 11:24.649
<i>Hey, Rin Tin Tin</i>
<i>looks like a wolf.</i>

11:24.651 --> 11:26.151
<i>They said, Rin Tin Tin,</i>

11:26.153 --> 11:27.585
<i>hey, man, can you be a wolf?</i>

11:27.587 --> 11:29.187
<i>Rin Tin Tin's like, Yeah.</i>

11:29.189 --> 11:31.222
<i>Then, boom, it's on.</i>

11:31.224 --> 11:32.557
<i>Rin Tin Tin crushed.</i>

11:32.559 --> 11:35.727
<i>Imagine, like,</i>
<i>[bleep] Ryan Stiles '96.</i>

11:35.729 --> 11:38.229
- [laughing]

11:38.231 --> 11:39.931
- That's how good
Rin Tin Tin was.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.499
<i>Then Harry Warner says,</i>

11:41.501 --> 11:44.836
<i>Man, how can we get more money</i>
<i>out of that dog?</i>

11:44.838 --> 11:47.505
<i>That's when Lee Duncan</i>
<i>steps up and says,</i>

11:47.507 --> 11:48.773
<i>Dude, funny you should ask.</i>

11:48.775 --> 11:51.710
<i>I have a script</i>
<i>involving this dog.</i>

11:51.712 --> 11:52.544
<i>Let's do it.</i>

11:52.546 --> 11:53.478
<i>Harry Warner's like,</i>

11:53.480 --> 11:54.779
<i>Yeah, this script's</i>
<i>pretty good.</i>

11:54.781 --> 11:55.814
<i>All right, let's do it.</i>

11:55.816 --> 11:58.650
<i>And so they make</i>
<i>Rin Tin Tin's first movie,</i>

11:58.652 --> 11:59.818
<i>and it's huge.</i>

11:59.820 --> 12:01.186
<i>The applause went on forever.</i>

12:01.188 --> 12:05.290
<i>And Rin Tin Tin went on</i>
<i>to make tons of movies.</i>

12:05.292 --> 12:07.192
<i>Ah, Rin Tin Tin is jumping.</i>

12:07.194 --> 12:08.159
<i>Rin Tin Tin is flying.</i>

12:08.161 --> 12:09.661
<i>Rin Tin Tin did his own stunts.</i>

12:09.663 --> 12:12.497
<i>So he became the biggest star</i>
<i>in Hollywood.</i>

12:12.499 --> 12:15.533
<i>Warner Brothers goes</i>
<i>from being worth $16 million</i>

12:15.535 --> 12:19.738
<i>to $200 million, like that,</i>
<i>because of a dog.</i>

12:19.740 --> 12:21.239
You could really argue
Rin Tin Tin

12:21.241 --> 12:23.508
was the best actor
in Hollywood at that time.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.777
<i>Dude, the first ever</i>
<i>Academy Awards,</i>

12:25.779 --> 12:27.178
<i>they had actors vote</i>

12:27.180 --> 12:28.847
<i>on who the best actor</i>
<i>in the world is.</i>

12:28.849 --> 12:31.916
<i>Well, when the award</i>
<i>for best actor came back,</i>

12:31.918 --> 12:33.952
<i>it was won by Rin Tin Tin,</i>

12:33.954 --> 12:36.654
<i>at which point they said,</i>
<i>We cannot have this.</i>

12:36.656 --> 12:37.589
<i>This is embarrassing.</i>

12:37.591 --> 12:39.758
<i>We want this award</i>
<i>to have some legitimacy.</i>

12:39.760 --> 12:43.595
<i>We cannot give it to</i>
<i>a goddamn dog.</i>

12:43.597 --> 12:44.529
- To a dog.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.463
- And then they did a recount,

12:45.465 --> 12:46.865
and they gave it
to some guy named Emil.

12:46.867 --> 12:50.935
And then, unfortunately,
in 1932, Rin Tin Tin dies.

12:50.937 --> 12:51.903
<i>And America stops.</i>

12:51.905 --> 12:56.641
<i>Like, they cut into every</i>
<i>radio broadcast at the time.</i>

12:56.643 --> 12:57.609
<i>People are devastated.</i>

12:57.611 --> 12:58.710
<i>People are like,</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

12:58.712 --> 12:59.944
<i>This is the biggest star</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

12:59.946 --> 13:01.112
<i>This is the biggest actor</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

13:01.114 --> 13:04.716
<i>This is the only actor</i>
<i>we really love since Valentino,</i>

13:04.718 --> 13:05.517
<i>and he's dead.</i>

13:05.519 --> 13:06.584
<i>And so people are so sad,</i>

13:06.586 --> 13:08.119
<i>and people never thought</i>
<i>another Rin Tin Tin</i>

13:08.121 --> 13:10.622
<i>could come again,</i>
<i>and they were right.</i>

13:10.624 --> 13:14.025
Dude, Rin Tin Tin, to me,
is the promise of L.A.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.361
Like, you can come down here
with a dream,

13:16.363 --> 13:18.763
and if you can do your job,

13:18.765 --> 13:21.032
man, it happens.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.801
This town is magic.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.637
I love Los Angeles
with all my heart.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.438
It's given me everything.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.740
I pinch myself.

13:28.742 --> 13:31.943
Life is
so beautiful here.

13:31.945 --> 13:32.944
[fart]

13:32.946 --> 13:33.778
[bleep].

13:33.780 --> 13:35.313
Yes, excuse me.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.515
I farted,
I admit it.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.216
But I'm allowed to.

13:38.218 --> 13:42.353
I got a great house,
girl, dog, everything.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.222
I farted.

13:47.426 --> 13:49.194
<i>- This is the second</i>
<i>or third year in 80 years</i>

13:49.196 --> 13:51.896
that anybody's been able
to kayak in the L.A. River.

13:51.898 --> 13:52.597
- I'm ready.

13:52.599 --> 13:53.765
Let's go down the L.A. River.

13:53.767 --> 13:54.732
- Let's go down there.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.134
- Ready when you are.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.136
- Oh, yeah!

13:58.138 --> 13:59.070
- The L.A. River
used to be

13:59.072 --> 14:02.707
the sole source of water
for the city of Los Angeles.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.843
- You know, when you
don't educate yourself,

14:04.845 --> 14:07.345
you just always imagine
the L.A. River's

14:07.347 --> 14:10.415
just the scene
from "Terminator."

14:10.417 --> 14:12.550
- We're gonna have
some rapids up ahead,

14:12.552 --> 14:13.518
so be careful.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.486
- L.A. River--oh, [bleep]!

14:15.488 --> 14:17.155
- Sweep left, sweep left!

14:17.157 --> 14:18.122
- Whoa!

14:18.124 --> 14:19.324
- Awesome.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.092
Whoa, hang on,
hang on.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.260
- Oh, no!

14:22.262 --> 14:23.628
Oh, no!

14:23.630 --> 14:24.629
Oh!

14:24.631 --> 14:26.097
Ah!

14:26.099 --> 14:28.933
[blowing whistle]

14:30.169 --> 14:32.704
- Hello, I'm Jeremy Konner.

14:32.706 --> 14:36.107
And today we're going
to talk about--

14:36.109 --> 14:37.175
- [laughs]

14:37.177 --> 14:38.343
Sorry.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.712
[laughter]

14:40.714 --> 14:41.813
That's hello.

14:41.815 --> 14:42.847
<i>You want to say hello.</i>

14:42.849 --> 14:45.083
- I'm so [bleep] up, man.

14:45.085 --> 14:45.750
- No, I see.

14:45.752 --> 14:46.985
You're looking at me over here,

14:46.987 --> 14:47.785
and I'm over here.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.954
- You're the goddamn
director of this.

14:49.956 --> 14:50.655
<i>- I know.</i>

14:50.657 --> 14:52.490
<i>I'm the goddamn director</i>
<i>of this.</i>

14:52.492 --> 14:54.659
<i>So far,</i>
<i>my favorite quote.</i>

14:54.661 --> 14:55.927
Go on.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.863
- Hello, I'm Jeremy Konner.

14:58.865 --> 15:02.333
And today we're going
to be talking

15:02.335 --> 15:05.603
about the L.A. aqueduct.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.438
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.573
<i>- Aqueduct.</i>

15:08.575 --> 15:12.410
<i>- So William Mulholland</i>
<i>is the head</i>

15:12.412 --> 15:15.346
<i>of the L.A. city water company.</i>

15:15.348 --> 15:16.648
<i>And he realizes, like,</i>

15:16.650 --> 15:18.316
<i>We need to figure something</i>
<i>out,</i>

15:18.318 --> 15:19.784
<i>because L.A. is growing.</i>

15:19.786 --> 15:22.387
<i>And either L.A.</i>
<i>has to stop growing</i>

15:22.389 --> 15:26.124
<i>or we have to figure out</i>
<i>more...water.</i>

15:26.126 --> 15:28.826
<i>Mulholland goes to Fred Eaton.</i>

15:28.828 --> 15:31.162
<i>I mean, he's just</i>
<i>the most powerful man.</i>

15:31.164 --> 15:34.232
<i>And he's like,</i>
<i>Hey, you're my best friend.</i>

15:34.234 --> 15:35.767
<i>You're my mentor.</i>

15:35.769 --> 15:36.901
<i>We're [bleep]-ed.</i>

15:36.903 --> 15:38.436
<i>Eaton is like,</i>

15:38.438 --> 15:39.671
<i>There is a place</i>

15:39.673 --> 15:42.340
<i>that I used to</i>
<i>go when I was a kid.</i>

15:42.342 --> 15:47.078
<i>It's a [bleep]-ing, like,</i>
<i>200 miles away.</i>

15:47.080 --> 15:48.046
<i>I know.</i>

15:48.048 --> 15:49.314
<i>It sounds nuts.</i>

15:49.316 --> 15:50.515
<i>But shut the [bleep] up.</i>

15:50.517 --> 15:52.884
<i>It's gonna save</i>
<i>all of our problems.</i>

15:52.886 --> 15:55.286
Mulholland's like...

15:55.288 --> 15:58.423
<i>I'm interested,</i>
<i>but I'm not...</i>

15:58.425 --> 16:04.395
<i>like, 100% on your page,</i>
<i>but I--</i>

16:04.397 --> 16:06.030
<i>I'm on your page.</i>

16:06.032 --> 16:07.198
<i>- But he's on a page.</i>

16:07.200 --> 16:09.000
- But he's on the page.

16:09.002 --> 16:12.003
<i>So they go up</i>
<i>to the Owens Valley,</i>

16:12.005 --> 16:13.304
<i>and Eaton is like,</i>

16:13.306 --> 16:19.577
<i>This lake is 4,000 feet</i>
<i>above sea level.</i>

16:19.579 --> 16:20.511
<i>Los Angeles,</i>

16:20.513 --> 16:23.381
<i>just a couple feet</i>
<i>above sea level.</i>

16:23.383 --> 16:24.349
<i>Mulholland's like,</i>

16:24.351 --> 16:27.318
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>it's all downhill.</i>

16:27.320 --> 16:31.222
<i>Broop, all the way</i>
<i>to L.A., 250 miles.</i>

16:31.224 --> 16:33.891
<i>Broop,</i>
<i>all the way to L.A.</i>

16:33.893 --> 16:35.393
<i>You just [bleep]-ing</i>
<i>build a pipe,</i>

16:35.395 --> 16:38.496
broop,
and you get to L.A.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.364
<i>But Eaton says,</i>

16:39.366 --> 16:41.733
<i>We're gonna have</i>
<i>to break some laws.</i>

16:41.735 --> 16:47.171
<i>We're gonna have to do</i>
<i>some shady, shady...</i>

16:47.173 --> 16:49.273
<i>Can we watch</i>
<i>"My Cousin Vinny"?</i>

16:49.275 --> 16:50.141
- No, you were talking.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.843
- You don't want to watch
"My Cousin Vinny"?

16:51.845 --> 16:53.778
- Let's just continue
on the story.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.646
- Oh, I was saying that--

16:55.648 --> 16:59.150
[stuttering]

16:59.152 --> 17:00.952
[laughter]

17:00.954 --> 17:03.021
<i>So Eaton starts buying up</i>

17:03.023 --> 17:05.490
<i>all of the Owens Valley,</i>
<i>illegally,</i>

17:05.492 --> 17:06.824
<i>because they need</i>
<i>the water rights.</i>

17:06.826 --> 17:10.495
<i>And they get the L.A. Times</i>
<i>to publish fake stories,</i>

17:10.497 --> 17:11.696
<i>like, "We're all gonna die.</i>

17:11.698 --> 17:15.433
<i>Guys, if we don't have water,</i>
<i>we're all gonna die."</i>

17:15.435 --> 17:17.001
And it's all nonsense.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.002
<i>It's all fake.</i>

17:18.004 --> 17:19.871
<i>There's spies,</i>
<i>there's bribery,</i>

17:19.873 --> 17:21.539
<i>there's manipulation.</i>

17:21.541 --> 17:23.875
<i>I mean, these guys</i>
<i>were the worst--</i>

17:23.877 --> 17:24.842
<i>worse than anyone.</i>

17:24.844 --> 17:26.878
But the most [bleep]-ed up
thing is,

17:26.880 --> 17:29.080
<i>Eaton, he sneaks off</i>
<i>to his buddies.</i>

17:29.082 --> 17:31.349
<i>This is</i>
<i>the San Fernando Syndicate.</i>

17:31.351 --> 17:32.250
<i>And he's like,</i>

17:32.252 --> 17:33.351
<i>There's this big ah--</i>

17:33.353 --> 17:36.287
<i>big-ass basin in</i>
<i>the San Fernando Valley</i>

17:36.289 --> 17:40.124
<i>that just [bleep]-ing</i>
<i>is just chilling out here.</i>

17:40.126 --> 17:42.894
<i>Buy up land</i>
<i>in the San Fernando Valley.</i>

17:42.896 --> 17:44.629
<i>And then,</i>
<i>when the water comes,</i>

17:44.631 --> 17:48.766
<i>we're all gonna make</i>
<i>gazillions.</i>

17:48.768 --> 17:51.002
"Chinatown," man.

17:51.004 --> 17:51.769
And eventually,

17:51.771 --> 17:54.939
<i>the people of L.A. vote</i>
<i>to create the aqueduct.</i>

17:54.941 --> 17:57.208
<i>This is a [bleep]-ing pipe</i>

17:57.210 --> 18:02.080
<i>in 1904, five, six, seven,</i>
<i>whatever,</i>

18:02.082 --> 18:06.117
<i>250 miles long.</i>

18:06.119 --> 18:08.252
<i>On the opening,</i>
<i>William Mulholland</i>

18:08.254 --> 18:11.756
<i>turns on the water,</i>
<i>and he's like,</i>

18:11.758 --> 18:13.091
<i>There it is.</i>

18:13.093 --> 18:13.691
<i>Take it.</i>

18:13.693 --> 18:15.927
<i>And the water starts</i>
<i>[bleep]-ing shooting out.</i>

18:15.929 --> 18:22.967
<i>And that is the great moment</i>
<i>of William Mulholland's...</i>

18:22.969 --> 18:24.635
<i>something.</i>

18:24.637 --> 18:25.770
Hey.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.338
- Oh, Jesus.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.140
- This is so stupid.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.541
[laughter]

18:34.613 --> 18:35.813
- [groaning]

18:35.815 --> 18:36.747
Hello.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.182
- Hi, Jer.

18:38.184 --> 18:39.016
What year are we in?

18:39.018 --> 18:43.955
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.523
<i>After 1913,</i>

18:45.525 --> 18:48.826
<i>water is coming to L.A.</i>
<i>like nobody's business.</i>

18:48.828 --> 18:51.929
<i>The population</i>
<i>is [bleep] exploding.</i>

18:51.931 --> 18:52.997
<i>There's palm trees.</i>

18:52.999 --> 18:55.500
<i>Palm trees don't exist</i>
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

18:55.502 --> 18:56.167
It's a desert.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.836
But the people who profit
most out of this

18:58.838 --> 19:01.639
<i>is Eaton and his buddies.</i>

19:01.641 --> 19:02.840
Then, in the 1920s,

19:02.842 --> 19:05.776
there's a drought,
and it's a real drought.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.246
<i>It's a [bleep]-ing</i>
<i>for real,</i>

19:08.248 --> 19:10.581
<i>for real, for real,</i>
<i>for real.</i>

19:10.583 --> 19:11.782
<i>And Mulholland says,</i>

19:11.784 --> 19:15.019
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>like, this is--</i>

19:15.021 --> 19:16.354
<i>We need a reservoir.</i>

19:16.356 --> 19:17.989
<i>Mulholland goes to Eaton.</i>

19:17.991 --> 19:20.858
<i>Eaton has bought up</i>
<i>the only dam site</i>

19:20.860 --> 19:22.326
<i>in the entire Owens Valley.</i>

19:22.328 --> 19:22.994
<i>And he's like,</i>

19:22.996 --> 19:25.530
<i>You can have my dam site</i>
<i>for $1 million.</i>

19:25.532 --> 19:26.797
<i>And Mulholland's like...</i>

19:26.799 --> 19:29.367
[distant moaning sound]

19:29.369 --> 19:31.769
[laughter]

19:31.771 --> 19:32.703
I didn't do that.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.205
<i>So Mulholland's like,</i>
<i>[bleep] it.</i>

19:34.207 --> 19:36.140
<i>I'm gonna build</i>
<i>the goddamn reservoir,</i>

19:36.142 --> 19:38.209
<i>and it's gonna be</i>
<i>[bleep]-ing beautiful,</i>

19:38.211 --> 19:40.044
<i>and, m'wah, [bleep] you.</i>

19:40.046 --> 19:43.314
<i>And he [bleep]-ing built</i>
<i>the St. Francis Dam</i>

19:43.316 --> 19:46.450
<i>in San Francis--</i>
<i>Francisquito.</i>

19:46.452 --> 19:48.252
<i>And everything is great.</i>

19:48.254 --> 19:49.120
<i>And then they go,</i>

19:49.122 --> 19:52.056
<i>Hey, William Mulholland,</i>
<i>there's a leak.</i>

19:52.058 --> 19:53.224
<i>And William Mulholland's like,</i>

19:53.226 --> 19:55.993
<i>I'm kind of in the middle</i>
<i>of a power play.</i>

19:55.995 --> 20:01.365
<i>I ain't worried about</i>
<i>that [bleep] [bleep], dawg.</i>

20:01.367 --> 20:02.466
<i>He goes to sleep.</i>

20:02.468 --> 20:03.201
<i>That night,</i>

20:03.203 --> 20:05.903
<i>he gets a phone call</i>
<i>in the night.</i>

20:05.905 --> 20:07.638
<i>The dam has broke.</i>

20:07.640 --> 20:11.842
<i>There are more dead than</i>
<i>the San Francisco earthquake.</i>

20:11.844 --> 20:17.582
<i>And this was</i>
<i>William Mulholland's downfall.</i>

20:17.584 --> 20:18.549
But in the end,

20:18.551 --> 20:22.453
between Mulholland and Eaton,
they were--

20:22.455 --> 20:24.555
<i>they created Los Angeles,</i>

20:24.557 --> 20:26.490
<i>but really Mulholland,</i>

20:26.492 --> 20:27.558
if it weren't for him,

20:27.560 --> 20:29.427
there would be no Los Angeles.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.228
- Cheers.

20:30.230 --> 20:35.533
- L.A. is a [bleep]-ing
nonsense of nonsenses.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.436
And it's the water.

20:40.372 --> 20:43.608
I am so [bleep]-ed up.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.476
- [laughs]

21:09.067 --> 21:09.967
- Oh, yeah!

21:09.969 --> 21:11.269
♪ I love L.A. ♪

21:11.271 --> 21:12.536
Oh, yeah!

21:12.538 --> 21:15.172
Oh, yeah--oh, no!

21:15.174 --> 21:16.607
Oh, yeah!

21:16.609 --> 21:17.475
[laughter]

21:17.477 --> 21:20.378
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!

21:20.380 --> 21:20.411
I got high
drinking the L.A. River.
