[wailing]

00:50.843 --> 00:51.844
[wails loudly]

00:52.177 --> 00:53.052
Hey, buddy.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.096
Oy. [grunts]

00:55.347 --> 00:56.849
Something I can help you with?

00:56.974 --> 00:58.684
Yes, Mo-Mo, there is.

00:59.059 --> 01:03.355
Ever since I was a handsome,
yet wise-beyond-his-years, young prince,

01:03.438 --> 01:07.860
I dreamed of having a kingdom
as far as the eye can see.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.029
I had crazy dreams when I was a kid, too.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.072
Heck, I believed I'd have a rewarding--

01:12.155 --> 01:13.866
-[coughing] Be quiet.
-...career.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.743
I don't want to listen to you.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.411
Back to what I care about.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.246
Do you notice anything weird

01:19.329 --> 01:21.665
when you look up at the sky, Maurice?

01:22.041 --> 01:27.212
-Uh, it's a pretty clear night, so stars.
-Hmm?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.214
-Eh, well...
-Mm. Mm.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.174
-The moon?
-Yeah, right there!

01:31.258 --> 01:32.133
Exactly!

01:32.843 --> 01:34.970
The royal eye can see the moon,

01:35.429 --> 01:38.682
yet the royal "we" doesn't own the moon.

01:38.807 --> 01:39.934
I must fix that.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.144
We must go up there and mark our territory

01:43.228 --> 01:45.022
-in the traditional lemur way.
-[gasps]

01:45.355 --> 01:48.108
That's right. We're gonna rub our butts

01:48.191 --> 01:50.402
on every inch of that space rock.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.238
-[screams]
-King's right. We need to get to the moon.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.699
Why do you always
sneak up on folks like that?

01:55.783 --> 01:57.200
-It's creepy!
-And creepy.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.202
I have reason to believe the crocodiles

01:59.286 --> 02:01.872
intend to get to the moon first
to install a laser.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.458
They could use that laser
to take over Madagascar...

02:04.541 --> 02:06.251
-[all screaming]
-...and then the world.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.045
[laughing maniacally]

02:08.169 --> 02:09.170
High five, sir.

02:09.296 --> 02:12.007
[grunts, struggling]

02:12.674 --> 02:16.637
Ooh, if Clover's paranoid delusion
turns out to be true,

02:16.720 --> 02:19.222
we'd be at the mercy of space-gators.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.224
There's only one thing to do.

02:21.433 --> 02:24.686
-Please don't say it.
-Mo-Mo, we're going to the moon!

02:24.770 --> 02:26.354
And boom goes the dynamite.

02:27.147 --> 02:31.610
Timo, could you inform Clover and the king
that there's no way of getting up there?

02:31.819 --> 02:34.113
I could, but I'd be a big fat liar!

02:34.195 --> 02:35.572
[laughs and snorts] Ooh!

02:35.739 --> 02:37.825
Not only is it possible
to get to the moon,

02:37.908 --> 02:39.952
I'm just the guy to help you do it.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.579
Jeez, I am sweating
with excitement right now.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.958
Is this what love feels like?
I'm seriously asking.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.711
Imagine how great it's gonna be
when we put our lasers on the moon?

02:49.795 --> 02:50.796
We'll be unstoppable!

02:50.963 --> 02:53.256
[laughs hysterically]

02:53.966 --> 02:56.135
Or, I mean, you know, might be cool.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.303
Cool the crazy, will you, Clover?

02:58.386 --> 03:00.097
You're gonna spoil my moon landing.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.640
Here, look at this.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.018
Would you believe,
my house was once in space?

03:04.183 --> 03:06.145
You're not suggesting we fly your house

03:06.227 --> 03:07.312
all the way to the moon.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.815
Of course not. All my stuff's in there.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.944
Luckily, my home is not the only space pod
that has crashed here.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.866
-Ooh!
-[grunts] I think we're in business.

03:19.033 --> 03:19.950
Yep, yep, this'll do.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.829
Let the training montage begin!

03:25.204 --> 03:28.416
You know what? Training is for dummies.
Let's do the launch.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.127
[giggles, snorts]

03:32.921 --> 03:34.631
My peoples.

03:34.715 --> 03:38.886
We choose to go to the moon,
not because it is easy,

03:38.969 --> 03:41.847
but because it seems like
a pretty cool idea.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.224
-[all cheering]
-Weather conditions, optimal.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.936
Machinery in tip-top shape.
My heart thumping like a jackrabbit.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.856
Let's blow this sucker sky high!

03:50.939 --> 03:52.858
Yeah! Aw, yeah!

03:53.025 --> 03:56.277
Let's show those handbags
in the crocodile kingdom who is boss!

03:56.528 --> 03:58.613
Huh! We'll put our own laser on the moon

03:58.697 --> 04:01.909
and burn the crocodile kingdom
down in a pre-emptive strike!

04:01.992 --> 04:02.868
Whoo-hoo!

04:03.035 --> 04:04.578
She's got some serious issues.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.831
I do not want to be stuck
in a space pod with all that crazy.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.709
-We gotta ditch her.
-[Ted] Well, shoes and socks!

04:10.792 --> 04:11.668
What's that, Ted?

04:12.586 --> 04:15.881
-There's a huge emergency?
-Sweet gherkins! There is?

04:16.757 --> 04:17.799
What kind of emergency?

04:17.883 --> 04:20.094
Yes, Ted, tell us all about the emergency.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.137
Clover needs to investigate immediately!

04:22.303 --> 04:24.223
Um, there is a...

04:24.806 --> 04:28.351
um, tickle monster! No. Uh, there...

04:28.518 --> 04:29.519
Um...

04:29.603 --> 04:32.231
There is a... a foosa!

04:32.313 --> 04:33.481
Um, with a...

04:33.565 --> 04:35.067
Ooh, uh...

04:35.150 --> 04:39.196
Three heads! No, just one head, but, uh...

04:40.072 --> 04:41.198
it's a huge head!

04:42.657 --> 04:45.535
A foosa with an abnormally large head.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.496
It does sound quite dangerous
and not made up.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.498
I'll be right back! On it!

04:51.666 --> 04:52.584
[chuckles] Oy!

04:52.751 --> 04:54.377
There's no emergency, is there?

04:54.502 --> 04:56.964
The emergency is that we were almost stuck

04:57.047 --> 05:00.175
in a spaceship with Clover
and all her crazy.

05:00.259 --> 05:03.011
Ugh, light this bad boy up
before she gets back.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.263
Oh! [snorts]

05:06.598 --> 05:09.684
I figured that big-headed foosa
was around here somewhere.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.729
I don't have time for this!
I have a spaceship to catch.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.151

-Space Daddy to ground control.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.570
Space Daddy to ground control,
are you reading me?

05:20.654 --> 05:22.114
I am reading you loud and clear.

05:22.363 --> 05:23.698
We blast off in...

05:24.032 --> 05:24.950
five...

05:25.117 --> 05:25.951
-Yay!
-...four...

05:26.160 --> 05:28.620
-three... two...

-Hmm?
-Ooh.

05:46.930 --> 05:51.226

right now. Check it!

05:51.310 --> 05:52.894
-Whoa, whoa!
-[laughing]

05:53.478 --> 05:57.649
I'm floating in the most peculiar way!
[laughs excitedly]

05:57.816 --> 06:00.986
[Timo]  This is ground control,
can we get a situation report?

06:01.069 --> 06:04.531
Uh, I think we might actually be in space.

06:04.614 --> 06:09.328
This is Charlie, Lima, Oscar, Victor...
It's-- Ugh! It's Clover. What happened?

06:09.494 --> 06:10.787
Why'd you leave without me?

06:10.871 --> 06:13.665
Oh, uh, Timo was worried
the wind was gonna pick up,

06:13.748 --> 06:14.916
so we couldn't wait.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.419
-[stammering] Uh, how are you?
-Hah! Good save, Mo-Mo.

06:18.586 --> 06:21.215
-Pretty sure she can hear you.
-I can hear you.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.423
Hi, Clover!

06:22.590 --> 06:23.424
[groans]

06:23.508 --> 06:26.594
-Anyhoo, we've reached zero gravity, and--
-[crashing]

06:26.887 --> 06:29.181
Was that a good or bad scream?
Please respond.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.599
-[both screaming]
-Maurice!

06:39.482 --> 06:41.442
[Maurice]  Something's gone wrong.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.196
Where are they? [growls]

06:44.612 --> 06:46.447
What did you do to my King Julien?

06:46.531 --> 06:47.699
Answer me, little man!

06:47.908 --> 06:49.368
I, uh, don't know what went wrong.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.495
Oh, that's okay. Mistakes happen.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.915
[snarls, growls]

06:55.290 --> 06:57.834
Fight later! Right now,
we've got a king to find

06:57.918 --> 07:01.171
who could be anywhere in the universe.
You! Fix this.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.464
Or I can't protect you from Mort.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.092
[snarling]

07:07.510 --> 07:08.762
King Julien?

Oh, no!

07:14.517 --> 07:15.810
Hold on, Your Majesty.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.479
Really?

07:22.734 --> 07:24.652
[sighs]

07:24.945 --> 07:26.238
You can do this, Maurice.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.782
It's just a little tongue. No big deal.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.533
Nobody ever has to know. [chuckles]

07:31.034 --> 07:34.079
-[inhales deeply, grunts]
-What are you doing?

07:34.162 --> 07:36.873
-Saving your life!
-By sucking my tongue?

07:37.082 --> 07:38.541
[retching, blows raspberry]

07:38.625 --> 07:41.962
I am no witch doctor,
but that's pretty weird, man,

07:42.045 --> 07:43.171
medically speaking.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.423
Wait! Are we...

07:44.798 --> 07:48.509
Maurice, look. We did it! [laughs]

07:49.136 --> 07:50.470
We are on the moon!

07:50.720 --> 07:52.264
Let's explore.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.725
Don't open the hatch! We don't know
if we can breathe out there.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.227
Eh, what's that, Maurice?

07:57.311 --> 08:00.021
I couldn't hear you
over me opening the hatch.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.940
No, Your Majesty, close it!

08:02.023 --> 08:02.941
Close what?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.403
[struggling, grunting]

08:06.569 --> 08:09.406
Maurice, are you crazy,
shoving us out like that?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.783
We don't even know
if we can breathe out here.

08:13.034 --> 08:16.037
[choking] Can't... breathe...

08:17.164 --> 08:19.540
[choking] No air.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.127
[gasping for air]

08:23.253 --> 08:24.463
Hold up, Your Majesty.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.966
You're okay. We can breathe.
You're not dying.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.969
What? Well, how do you know?

08:31.136 --> 08:32.553
Because we're not on the moon.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.307
The moon's right there,
and we're right here.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.683
Uh-huh. Yeah.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.436
Well, it's obvious what happened.

08:40.103 --> 08:41.146
So...

08:41.313 --> 08:46.901
We overshot the moon, and now,
we're the first lemurs on Mars!

08:46.985 --> 08:49.404
-[laughs] Up top!
-Oy.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.614
One small step for lemurs,

08:51.698 --> 08:53.908
one sick burn for all the haters

08:53.992 --> 08:56.619
who said I'd never make it here.
[laughs]

08:56.703 --> 08:58.955
I'd hate to be those loser crocodiles

08:59.039 --> 09:02.292
with their lame laser right about now.
[laughs]

09:02.376 --> 09:04.878
Come on, let's mark our territory.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.464
-I wouldn't do that.
-I would.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.384
[Julien screams] Oww!
Ow, ow!

09:10.758 --> 09:12.010
[screaming]

09:12.886 --> 09:15.930
[screaming in pain]

09:16.097 --> 09:17.640
Don't just stand there, Maurice!

09:17.724 --> 09:20.310
Help me claim the planet for Madagascar.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.354
[Julien screaming]

09:22.603 --> 09:24.814
[both groaning]

09:26.691 --> 09:30.111
Put your back into it, man, like this.
[screams]

09:31.905 --> 09:34.741
-[Maurice] Like... this?
-[Julien screaming]

09:35.492 --> 09:37.452
[Clover]  Maurice! Space Daddy!

09:37.536 --> 09:39.538
Can you hear me? Please respond.

09:40.621 --> 09:44.125
So it seems I may have been
a little off in my arithmetic.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.379
Nobody feels as bad as me
that this didn't work.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.715
Not as bad as you're gonna feel!
[snarls]

09:53.552 --> 09:56.012
-[Julien]  Ow, ow.
-[static]

09:56.346 --> 09:57.847
[Julien screaming]

09:58.265 --> 09:59.474
They're still alive.

09:59.558 --> 10:04.729
Aw, they didn't even escape the Earth's
gravitational pull. But they're alive.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.899
Yay. I'll triangulate their position.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.318
I'll triangulate your face, Poindexter.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.571

-[Julien screaming over radio]

10:12.779 --> 10:14.781
Are you finally ready to stop now?

10:14.906 --> 10:18.118
Never! My peoples
wouldn't want me to quit.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.578
This is for them.

10:19.869 --> 10:20.703
[whimpers]

10:21.037 --> 10:23.831
[screams]

10:23.915 --> 10:25.166
And... I'm done.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.586
-Well, let's go find an alien.
-What?

10:27.835 --> 10:31.923
Yes, we should go give the Martians
the good news that I'm their new king.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.717
I'm sure Mars is supposed to be red,
Your Majesty.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.095
I don't think we even left Madagascar.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.846
[exhales]

10:39.764 --> 10:44.185
[both screaming]

10:46.605 --> 10:49.483
[both continue screaming]

10:52.819 --> 10:53.694
[screams]

10:54.446 --> 10:55.322
[screams]

10:55.405 --> 10:58.241
King Julien,
I don't think he wants to hurt us.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.868
[speaking Russian]

11:01.244 --> 11:02.120
Stanislav!

11:02.370 --> 11:06.124
He is speaking some strange alien tongue.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.251
Which means...
[shouting gibberish]

11:08.502 --> 11:10.837
We are in space!
I was right. You were wrong.

11:11.463 --> 11:14.841
-Uh, is that your name?
-Da.  Stanislav.

11:14.924 --> 11:18.512
Hello! I am King Julien.

11:18.886 --> 11:22.098
This is my friend, Maurice.

11:22.681 --> 11:26.269
We are very happy to be on Mars!

11:26.894 --> 11:28.480
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

11:28.855 --> 11:30.524
[chattering]

11:30.815 --> 11:34.068
I think he wants us to follow him
to meet his Martian king.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.446
I still don't think we're on Mars.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.697
Take us to your leader, Martian.

11:38.781 --> 11:39.658
[sighs]

11:43.286 --> 11:46.456
Ooh, look at all this Martian artwork.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.668
[singing in Russian]

11:57.091 --> 11:58.759
Eh, eh, eh! Uh...

11:58.843 --> 12:01.304
I'm having a little trouble
enjoying the Mars art

12:01.388 --> 12:04.391
with all that awful alien noise
you're making.

12:04.723 --> 12:06.142
-No offense.
-[grumbles]

12:07.018 --> 12:07.935
Mother.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.232
Ah, yes, she's very beautiful.
Very hairy woman.

12:12.315 --> 12:16.194
I can see the resemblance.
[whispers] That's not a compliment.

12:16.444 --> 12:20.907
Yeesh. These Martians aren't winning
any beauty contests, I can tell you that.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.159
Again, Your Majesty, not on Mars.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.827
If we're not on Mars,

12:24.911 --> 12:28.831
then how come that mob
of Martians is coming for us? Huh?

12:33.044 --> 12:35.672
Everyone just stay still.
Maybe they won't see us.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.219
Oops. [whispers] I moved a little.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.303
[groans]

12:44.264 --> 12:45.806
Aw, man, I moved again.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.975
Please stay quiet, Your Majesty.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.438
Okay, I'm all good.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.400
[grunting]

12:58.152 --> 13:01.030
I'm not going to do this.
[exclaiming]

13:01.281 --> 13:02.282
That's the stuff.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.159
-[growling]
-[chattering]

13:06.785 --> 13:08.288
[Mort grunting]

13:09.788 --> 13:10.707
King Julien?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.461
Hi, King Julien.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.088
[Julien] Uh, King Julien's not here,

13:17.213 --> 13:18.590
Martian who sounds like Clover.

13:18.797 --> 13:21.008
Ahem, it is Clover, Your Majesty.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.219
King Julien, this is amazing!

13:24.095 --> 13:26.306
You've found the first Pan troglodytes

13:26.389 --> 13:27.641
ever recorded on the island.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.017
Tro... trog... trogli...

13:30.351 --> 13:33.480
Is that another word for Martian?
Because then yes, I did.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.607
No, King Julien. The monkey.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.734
Chimpanzees are not native to Madagascar.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.945
-Then, how'd he get here?
-This is something. [snorts]

13:41.070 --> 13:42.656
I think Stanislav here

13:42.739 --> 13:44.865
was once a part of Russia's space program.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.285
Da! Da!  Mother Russia.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.869
[singing in Russian]

13:49.162 --> 13:49.996
What?

13:50.413 --> 13:52.373
You mean, we're not on Mars?

13:52.749 --> 13:54.875
Uh, nope. No, no. See?

13:55.502 --> 13:58.004
Ahh! Just, "ahh"!

13:58.296 --> 14:00.381
I've let my peoples down.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.425
Now, now, King Julien, don't be hasty.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.136
We've got ourselves a bona fide
space monkey here!

14:05.219 --> 14:08.055
With his help, I'm sure
we can correct my initial errors

14:08.139 --> 14:09.349
and get you to the moon!

14:09.557 --> 14:12.935
Really?
Then, this is the best day of my life!

14:13.102 --> 14:14.729
[Mort] King Julien is happy!

14:14.813 --> 14:16.523
-Yay! Oof!
-[Stanislav grunts]

14:16.690 --> 14:20.360
[cheering]

14:21.402 --> 14:23.446
Yes, yes, my peoples!

14:23.530 --> 14:27.074
Thank you for this very warm
and very appropriate welcome.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.455
Peoples, I have bad news,

14:32.539 --> 14:33.873
and I have good news.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.501
Bad news is, we didn't get to the moon.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.960
-[all gasping]
-[sputters]

14:38.044 --> 14:41.589
What? Now those crazy crocodiles
will get there first

14:41.673 --> 14:43.717
and plant their deadly space laser.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.845
We're all gonna get laser-ed!

14:47.011 --> 14:48.513
[all screaming]

14:48.596 --> 14:49.848
Calm down!

14:50.014 --> 14:53.934
I, your beautiful and talented king,
have a new plan.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.896
With the help of a real live space monkey,

14:56.979 --> 14:58.981
we will get to the moon.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.360
I swear it by my bouncing booty.

15:04.904 --> 15:05.739
[shushing]

15:06.364 --> 15:07.240
[giggles]

15:07.407 --> 15:10.284
As you can see, my primate pal,
what we are dealing with

15:10.493 --> 15:12.036
is a problem without a solution.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.497
[speaking Russian]

15:14.581 --> 15:15.456
Da!

15:15.623 --> 15:17.876
That you seem to have just solved.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.754
Wow. Where'd you learn how to do that?

15:20.837 --> 15:21.755
Mother.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.631
Well, she must be a smart lady.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.925
Aw, man, look at all that math.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.052
Do more! Do more! [snorts]

15:28.219 --> 15:29.429
How's it coming, eggheads?

15:29.512 --> 15:32.932
We're all systems go, full speed ahead,
buckle up, baby, buckle up.

15:33.099 --> 15:37.270
Righteous. Stanislav, the manislav,
looks like you're going to the moon.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.105
Moon? Moon?

15:39.188 --> 15:41.566
Nyet!  Home! Home!

15:41.649 --> 15:43.192
That's right, Stan-my-man,

15:43.276 --> 15:45.194
the moon will be your new home.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.947
[Stanislav chatters angrily]

15:48.114 --> 15:49.783
I can't be the only one who notices

15:49.866 --> 15:52.118
that Stanislav
doesn't want to go to the moon.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.578
What? Look at him.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.747
Of course he wants to go to the moon.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.624
Nyet! Nyet, nyet!

15:57.832 --> 16:00.376
[laughs] Love the enthusiasm, buddy.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.629
Nyet!  Mother. Mother!

16:02.796 --> 16:06.132
Yeah, yeah, we're all very aware
of your mommy issues.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.510
FYI, you might want to talk
to a professional about that.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.095
Mother!

16:11.262 --> 16:14.140
[grunts] Perhaps "mother"
is what he calls Russia.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.475
He wants to go home.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.017
[speaking Russian]

16:17.226 --> 16:19.520
Da, da.  Mother Russia.

16:19.687 --> 16:23.566
Oh, so you miss the beautiful beaches
of Russia, huh?

16:23.691 --> 16:27.069
Well, you're in luck, buddy.
We can send you back.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.863
Eh, we can, right?

16:28.947 --> 16:29.864
You bet we can.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.532
We can send you back.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.910
-[chattering]
-[sighs]

16:34.368 --> 16:38.581
Stanislav, if you can whip
this rag-tag bunch into shape

16:38.665 --> 16:41.709
and show us what real astronauting
is all about--

16:41.793 --> 16:44.754
And install a space laser on the moon
before the crocodiles do.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.631
Cool it with the lasers, already.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.090
You're freaking everybody out.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.426
Hey, buddy. Get us to the moon,

16:50.510 --> 16:52.971
and we'll get you back home to Russia.

16:54.013 --> 16:54.889
I promise.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.934
Oh, yeah, bring it in--

16:58.768 --> 17:00.019
[kissing]

17:00.478 --> 17:06.275
That was nice. Okay.
Let the training montage begin!

17:06.609 --> 17:07.986
For reals this time, you guys.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.487
[motivational music playing]

17:09.570 --> 17:10.697
[grunting]

17:25.044 --> 17:26.796
[gasps, coughs]

17:26.921 --> 17:28.339
How long was I under?

17:29.507 --> 17:32.176
That's gotta be a record. [panting]

17:32.343 --> 17:33.302
Four seconds.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.015
[groans] Yes! New personal best.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.225
[laughs and heaves]

17:40.518 --> 17:42.144
[Mort grunting]

17:46.065 --> 17:46.941
Hey!

17:48.484 --> 17:50.361
[Mort groaning]

17:51.237 --> 17:52.321
[Mort retches]

17:53.698 --> 17:54.657
[retches]

17:56.075 --> 17:58.661
What's everybody looking at?
[retches]

18:00.538 --> 18:01.789
Nope. Nothing.

18:12.383 --> 18:13.551
Ohh!

18:15.511 --> 18:16.429
Huzzah!

18:16.554 --> 18:18.848
You've perfected the heroic
slow-motion walk.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.767
It's probably the most important skill

18:20.850 --> 18:22.226
for an astronaut to master.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.686
You're ready.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.483
Uh, King Julien?

18:29.984 --> 18:32.319
I-I've uncovered a slight problem.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.698
It's our fuel. If we go to the moon,
there won't be enough left

18:35.823 --> 18:37.491
to send Stanislav back to Russia.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.994
You interrupted my slo-mo walk for that?

18:40.078 --> 18:42.329
Then we can just explain to Stanislav

18:42.413 --> 18:45.207
that he can't go back home and, oh...

18:45.792 --> 18:49.670
But I promised.
He wants to go home so badly.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.590
-Everything all right?
-Yup, everything's great.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.093
My peoples need us to get to the moon.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.512
It's the only thing a lot of them
have to look forward to.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.140
Aw, it'll make them happy.

19:01.307 --> 19:04.226
Somebody needs to give Stanislav
the bad news, I guess.

19:04.435 --> 19:07.730
You can give him the bad news
after we get back from the moon.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.776
Hopefully, he'll have forgotten
all about Russia by then anyway.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.531
My peoples.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.993
Today, we embark
on a mission to the moon!

19:20.076 --> 19:20.952
[all cheering]

19:21.119 --> 19:25.790
By my bouncing booty,
we will get to the moon!

19:26.290 --> 19:29.836
With the help of a real live
space monkey, I swear it.

19:29.919 --> 19:32.546
I would like to say
that the ugly rumor going around

19:32.630 --> 19:34.048
that we are running low on fuel

19:34.132 --> 19:36.634
and won't get Stanislav
back to Russia, it's true!

19:36.801 --> 19:37.635
Huh?

19:39.386 --> 19:42.140
You're not very good
at keeping secrets, are you?

19:42.306 --> 19:44.308
Mother? Mother?

19:44.976 --> 19:46.853
[shouting]

19:47.145 --> 19:49.105
Mother! Mother!

19:49.188 --> 19:50.356
What's going on up there?

19:50.815 --> 19:53.860
Ooh, you're very strong.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.781
[chattering]

19:59.032 --> 20:04.411
[Mort] Hey, everybody!
I can see my stump from here!

20:04.620 --> 20:06.831
-We gotta do something, Your Majesty.
-On it!

20:06.998 --> 20:09.000
No. I should talk to him.

20:09.083 --> 20:12.336
He looks up to me and thinks of me
as a cool uncle figure.

20:12.503 --> 20:15.173
He'll respect my authority as king.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.383
[grunting]

20:17.967 --> 20:21.054
Not really respecting
the kingly authority, buddy. Truce?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.638
-[growls]
-[grunts]

20:23.056 --> 20:25.599
-Ah, that's better. [grunts]
-[Mort] Ah!

20:25.933 --> 20:29.603
Now, I know you were really excited
about going home.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.230
And who could blame you?

20:31.313 --> 20:33.900
I'm sure Madagascar
is pretty disappointing

20:33.983 --> 20:37.486
when you compare it
to the splendors of Russia.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.780
[singing in Russian]

20:41.365 --> 20:42.282
Eh, eh, eh, eh!

20:42.366 --> 20:44.744
Unfortunately, buddy,
we can't send you home

20:44.827 --> 20:47.830
because my peoples
really need a moon colony.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.124
[Clover] And the giant space laser!

20:50.791 --> 20:52.043
Yeah, it's a big dream,

20:52.126 --> 20:54.712
but sometimes you just gotta dream big

20:54.795 --> 20:56.630
in order to make that magic happen.

20:56.839 --> 21:00.634
I mean, just think of it.
Lemurs on the moon.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.720
Well, that's some serious magic, right?

21:03.054 --> 21:05.765
I mean, you get that, right?

21:07.892 --> 21:10.477
-Da. Da...
-Aw.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.688
Don't be like that.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.441
If we do what you want to do,

21:15.566 --> 21:19.153
we won't get to do what I want to do.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.531
Da, da.

21:23.532 --> 21:28.537
[all] Five... four...
three... two... one.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.747
[rumbling]

21:34.001 --> 21:36.545
So, you gave up your dream
of going to the moon

21:36.629 --> 21:39.298
to help Stanislav get home. Why?

21:39.506 --> 21:43.510
Yeah, I started to think about
how much I would miss Madagascar.

21:43.594 --> 21:46.097
Even if I was stuck somewhere
with all the freedom

21:46.180 --> 21:47.890
and great weather of Russia.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.145
[reporters clamoring]

21:56.356 --> 22:00.278
Still, it kills me that those crocodiles
are going to beat us to the moon

22:00.360 --> 22:03.405
-and put their lasers up there.
-Okay, take it easy Clover.

22:03.489 --> 22:08.744
Besides, in what world could crocodiles
actually make it to the moon?

22:08.828 --> 22:11.914
[laughs] Much less put lasers up there.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.666
[laughs]

22:13.916 --> 22:17.336
[crocodile]  I am on the moon
and I've installed the moon laser,

22:17.544 --> 22:20.047
and it looks like we're all systems go.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.633
-I guess I'll head on back to Earth.
-[all cheering]

22:22.716 --> 22:26.053
Uh, that reminds me,
how am I getting back?

22:26.428 --> 22:28.139
Uh... [mumbling]

22:28.222 --> 22:29.890
Oh, no, we're breaking up!

22:29.974 --> 22:32.101
[imitates static noise]

22:32.643 --> 22:34.270
Well, we're losing connection.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.397
Sun spots.
Uh, we'll try again later.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.150
[mumbles nervously]

22:41.527 --> 22:43.321
[singing in Russian]
