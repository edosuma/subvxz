WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:02.124
- PREVIOUSLY ON PSYCH...

00:02.170 --> 00:05.560
- YANG IS THE MOST NOTORIOUS
KILLER THIS CITY HAS NEVER SEEN.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.033
- THIS SWITCH
HAS SUCH A LIGHT TOUCH.

00:07.070 --> 00:08.492
AND THEN BOOM!

00:08.540 --> 00:11.031
- YOU'RE GONNA ROT IN A CELL
WITH FOUR PADDED WALLS, THE END.

00:11.070 --> 00:13.538
- MARY, YOU SEEM DISTURBED.
EVEN MORE SO THAN USUAL.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.070
- YANG WASN'T WORKING ALONE.

00:15.110 --> 00:17.704
- SO THERE REALLY
IS A YIN TO HER YANG.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.638
- MARY!
I WANTED TO BE HEROIC.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.510
- HE WAS RIGHT THERE!

00:20.550 --> 00:21.812
- SHAWN, THE LAST TIME
THIS HAPPENED,

00:21.850 --> 00:23.340
YOU PUT YOUR LIFE
ON THE LINE.

00:23.390 --> 00:24.584
AND WE ALMOST
LOST YOUR MOTHER.

00:24.620 --> 00:26.781
- THIS GUY HAS
NEVER GONE UP AGAINST ME.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.515
I WILL BEAT HIM.

00:28.560 --> 00:29.527
- JULIET!

00:29.560 --> 00:30.584
- HE'S GOT HER.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.359
- IF YOU THINK I'M SICK...

00:32.400 --> 00:34.550
YOU AIN'T
SEEN NOTHING YET.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.568
- THIS GAME ISN'T OVER.

00:50.110 --> 00:52.419
[children
yelling, playing]

00:52.450 --> 00:54.714
[dog barks]

01:12.700 --> 01:14.463
- IF I HAD TO CHOOSE...

01:14.500 --> 01:17.333
I WOULD DIE EXECUTION-STYLE
BY FIRING SQUAD.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.679
- FIRST OF ALL, NOBODY'S
ASKING YOU TO CHOOSE.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.632
AND SECONDLY, WHY THAT?
IT'S BRUTAL AND VIOLENT.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.541
BUT I WOULD SELECT
ALL MY SHOOTERS PERSONALLY.

01:24.580 --> 01:26.616
GEORGE CARLIN, ABBOT--
OR COSTELLO--

01:26.650 --> 01:28.140
OR WHOEVER THE FAT ONE WAS.

01:28.180 --> 01:30.410
RICHARD PRYOR, ADAM BRODY--
ALL THE COMEDY GREATS.

01:30.450 --> 01:31.747
HOW FUNNY WOULD THAT BE?
- IT WOULDN'T BE.

01:31.790 --> 01:33.109
YOU'D BE DEAD.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.752
- WHY DO YOU GOTTA
TAKE IT TO A DARK PLACE?

01:34.790 --> 01:36.587
- HER NAME
IS ALLISON COWLEY.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.690
SHE CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED
BY OUR SERIAL KILLER, MR. YIN.

01:39.730 --> 01:42.119
AND SHE WON'T GIVE
HER STATEMENT TO ANYONE BUT YOU.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.467
WHAT IS THAT SOUND?

01:43.500 --> 01:44.660
- OH, I'M SORRY, CHIEF.

01:44.700 --> 01:45.894
SUCKING CAN DY?

01:45.930 --> 01:47.693
- WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.401
- OKAY, THE SITUATION
IS THAT GUS AND I

01:49.440 --> 01:50.566
FIELD SIX OF
THESE YIN CALLS A MONTH

01:50.610 --> 01:51.759
- 6.8.

01:51.810 --> 01:54.335
- THAT WOULD INSINUATE ONE
OF US WAS MISSING AN APPENDAGE.

01:54.380 --> 01:55.438
SUCKING CAN DY?

01:55.480 --> 01:56.674
- NO.

01:56.710 --> 01:58.246
TH ESE YINITES
COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK

01:58.280 --> 02:00.373
LOOKING FOR SOME KIND
OF THRILL, OR A VALIDATION, OR--

02:00.420 --> 02:03.184
- CLOSURE.
- SICKOS AND WHACKJOBS.

02:03.220 --> 02:04.346
BUT VERY SAD.

02:04.390 --> 02:05.641
- I CONCUR, LASSIE.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.248
SUCK.

02:07.290 --> 02:08.882
- MR. SPENCER,
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION

02:08.920 --> 02:11.650
TO INVESTIGATE EVERY CLAIM
THAT COMES INTO THIS STATION.

02:11.690 --> 02:12.725
SO GET IN THERE.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.159
- YOU KNOW, THESE YINITES

02:14.200 --> 02:15.724
ARE USUALLY WOMEN
IN THEIR LATE 40$.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.625
YOU'RE OFF-TYPE,
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.831
AND I'M GUESSING THAT'S
YOUR RED JE'I'I'A OUT FRONT?

02:19.870 --> 02:21.690
AM I RIGHT?

02:23.540 --> 02:26.270
- SHE SEEMS
GENUINELY UPSET.

02:26.310 --> 02:28.369
- I WAS KIDNAPPED.

02:28.410 --> 02:29.877
I SHOULD BE DEAD RIGHT NOW.

02:29.910 --> 02:31.639
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW THAT FEELS?

02:31.680 --> 02:32.510
- [sighs]

02:32.550 --> 02:33.847
- WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT THIS IS YIN?

02:33.880 --> 02:35.711
- I DON'T THINK,
I KNOW.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.411
I HEARD HIS VOICE.

02:37.450 --> 02:39.554
HE TOLD ME I WAS SPECIAL.

02:39.590 --> 02:41.751
AND THEN HE
SHACKLED ME TO A PIPE.

02:42.860 --> 02:45.420
THIS WAS MY RETAINER.

02:45.460 --> 02:48.327
NOW IT'S JUST A LITTLE PIECE
OF WIRE THAT SAVED MY LIFE.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.694
I CAME TO YOU BECAUSE THIS
IS VERY, VERY REAL

02:52.740 --> 02:54.230
AND VERY PERSONAL.

02:55.940 --> 02:57.601
- I DON'T NEED TO
BE HERE ANYMORE, DO I?

02:57.640 --> 02:59.369
- NO.

02:59.410 --> 03:00.570
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

03:00.610 --> 03:02.305
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
BEEN THROUGH SOMETHING.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.169
OKAY, SURE.

03:03.210 --> 03:04.746
AND I KNOW IT
FEELS VERY REAL TO YOU.

03:04.780 --> 03:07.749
BUT REGARDLESS OF WHAT
YOU'VE READ OR MAY HAVE HEARD,

03:07.780 --> 03:10.908
I HAVE NO PERSONAL CONNECTION
TO THIS PSYCHOPATH.

03:10.950 --> 03:12.611
ALL RIGHT?
I'M SORRY.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.718
SORRY TO LET YOU DOWN.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.387
- I STOLE
THIS ON MY WAY OUT.

03:15.420 --> 03:16.523
[picture thuds]

03:27.600 --> 03:30.569
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know, You Know]

03:30.610 --> 03:34.706
*

03:34.740 --> 03:38.346
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

03:38.380 --> 03:41.577
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

03:41.620 --> 03:43.747
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

03:43.790 --> 03:45.485
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

03:45.520 --> 03:50.457
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

03:50.490 --> 03:53.755
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

03:53.800 --> 03:55.791
*

03:55.830 --> 03:59.334
* I KNOW, YOU KNOW, THAT
I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

03:59.370 --> 04:02.601
* I KNOW, YOU KNOW, THEY
JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

04:02.640 --> 04:04.460
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

04:04.510 --> 04:05.659
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

04:05.710 --> 04:07.701
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

04:07.740 --> 04:10.300
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU
OUT IN THE END *

04:10.350 --> 04:12.716
* I KNOW, YOU KNOW

04:20.520 --> 04:21.851
- YOU'RE SURE THIS IS
THE HOUSE, RIGHT?

04:21.890 --> 04:22.879
- I'M POSITIVE.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.522
- STAY HERE.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.826
ALL RIGHT,
ON MY COUNT.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.964
OKAY.
ONE, TWO, GO!

04:34.000 --> 04:36.468
[loud bang]
- SBPD!

04:36.510 --> 04:37.704
HANDS IN THE AIR!

04:37.740 --> 04:38.866
- HEY!
- HANDS IN THE AIR!

04:38.910 --> 04:41.708
HANDS IN THE AIR!
- HEY!

04:41.740 --> 04:46.677
[overlapping shouts
and struggling]

04:46.720 --> 04:48.574
- AW, CRAP.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.418
- AGAIN,
WE APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.452
AND THE SERGEANT
BEHIND YOU WILL INDEED

04:53.490 --> 04:54.980
TAKE YOUR STATEMENT
AT THIS TIME.

04:55.020 --> 04:56.578
- IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.983
THERE WERE NO PEOPLE.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.918
NONE OF THIS IS RIGHT.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.848
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF
TH RILLS YOU WERE AFI'ER

05:01.900 --> 05:03.868
AT THE EXPENSE OF THE SANTA
BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT,

05:03.900 --> 05:06.027
BUT YOU CAN BET
THAT I WILL PERSONALLY

05:06.070 --> 05:08.493
BE PURSUING CHARGES FOR
FILING A FALSE POLICE REPORT.

05:08.540 --> 05:11.031
- CHIEF, WE JUMPED THE GUN,
AND WE DO APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY.

05:11.070 --> 05:12.935
- WHOA, WHOA, WAIT
JUST ONE PROFUSE SECOND HERE.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.675
WHAT ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPH?

05:14.710 --> 05:16.905
- IF YOU HADN'T HAD THAT PSYCHIC
TIZZY FIT BACK AT THE STATION,

05:16.950 --> 05:19.100
WE WOULD'VE TAKEN THE TIME
TO HAVE THE PHOTOGRAPH ANALYZED.

05:19.150 --> 05:20.777
LOOKED PHOTOSHOPPED TO ME.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.969
- ANALYZE IT.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.487
AND THEN GET BACK
TO ME WITHIN SECONDS

05:23.520 --> 05:26.080
OF YOU HAVING
ANYTHING CONCLUSIVE.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.019
- I'M NOT CRAZY.
HE BROUGHT ME HERE.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.687
- [sigh]
- I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.624
STRAIGHT AHEAD IS
THE KITCHEN.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.921
GO TO THE LEFT,
THERE'S A FIREPLACE

05:38.970 --> 05:40.369
WITH RIVER ROCK.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.731
FRENCH DOORS
GO OUT TO THE YARD.

05:41.770 --> 05:43.101
TO MY RIGHT,
THERE'S STAIRS GOING UP

05:43.140 --> 05:45.461
WITH A STAINED GLASS WINDOW.
AT THE BASE, TULIPS.

05:46.840 --> 05:47.909
- WOW.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.009
REALLY?
TU LIPS?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.974
THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS WORTH
STAINING IN THE GLASS?

05:51.010 --> 05:52.648
NO.
I WOULD'VE DONE SOMETHING

05:52.680 --> 05:54.511
WITH KRISTY SWANSON'S CHARACTER
FROM HIGHER LEARNING.

05:54.550 --> 05:56.142
HUH? MAYBE HER
HITTING A BACKHAND.

05:56.180 --> 05:57.909
- PLEASE BELIEVE ME.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.727
- UM, SHAWN, CAN
I TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC?

06:02.760 --> 06:03.988
- YEAH.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.419
ONE SECOND.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.121
- SHAWN, I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED.
- I KNOW.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.128
I KNOW, I'VE BEEN WEARING THESE
JEANS FOR SEVEN MONTHS STRAIGHT.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.159
I'M GONNA WASH THEM
THIS WEEKEND.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.167
- STOP IT.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.997
YOU STILL BELIEVE
THIS GIRL?

06:14.040 --> 06:16.600
- I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE, BUT
SHOULDN'T WE GIVE HER A CHANCE?

06:16.640 --> 06:17.868
WHAT IF SHE IS
TELLING THE TRUTH?

06:17.910 --> 06:20.105
- SHAWN, I WAS WILLING TO GIVE
HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT,

06:20.140 --> 06:22.608
BUT THIS HAS BEEN
A COMPLETE WASTE OF OUR TIME.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.948
AND A LITTLE SICK,
QUITE FRANKLY.

06:24.980 --> 06:26.470
- WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR
YOU TO IMAGINE?

06:26.520 --> 06:27.942
YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.140
ARE YOU AFRAID
TO BELIEVE HER?

06:38.690 --> 06:40.851
HEY, ALLISON,
WHERE ARE YOU STAYING?

06:40.900 --> 06:42.891
- I'M LIVING IN
AN APARTMENT OFF-CAMPUS.

06:42.930 --> 06:44.067
- RIGHT.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.159
THAT DOESN'T FEEL TOO SAFE.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.963
AT LEAST NOT UNTIL
WE SORT THIS OUT.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.959
YOU KNOW, WE KNOW A PLACE
WHERE YOU'LL BE IN GOOD HANDS.

06:52.010 --> 06:56.071
OLD, CALLOUSED HANDS,
BUT SAFE.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.448
- SO ARE YOU PSYCHIC TOO?

07:01.480 --> 07:03.482
- [chokes softly]
UH, NO.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.488
NO, THAT'S...

07:05.520 --> 07:09.479
THAT'S SHAWN'S GIFI'...
ALONE.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.849
HERE YOU GO.
NOW SIP IT, IT'S HOT.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.027
- THANK YOU.

07:12.060 --> 07:13.925
YOU GUYS
SEEM REALLY CLOSE.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.861
- YEAH, THAT'S ME
FORCING SHAWN TO FISH.

07:16.900 --> 07:17.924
HE HATED IT.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.426
PHOTOGRAPHS CAN
BE VERY DECEIVING.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.101
- THE PIXEL IS THE SMALLEST
ADDRESSABLE SCREEN ELEMENT.

07:23.140 --> 07:26.007
IT'S THE SMALLEST UNIT OF A
PICTURE THAT CAN BE CONTROLLED.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.076
EACH PIXEL
HAS IT'S OWN ADDRESS.

07:28.110 --> 07:28.906
- IS THE PICTURE REAL?

07:28.940 --> 07:30.646
- PARTS OF IT ARE.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.045
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

07:32.080 --> 07:35.516
- WELL THE BACKGROUND IS
SIMPLY THAT--IT'S CHANGEABLE.

07:35.550 --> 07:39.088
THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN LAID
ON TOP OF A FIXED PIXEL ARRAY.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.553
IT'S FAKE.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.012
- NOW WE'RE TALKING.

07:42.060 --> 07:44.028
- THESE PIXELS, HOWEVER,

07:44.060 --> 07:46.051
ARE RENDERED FROM
THE SAME SET OF SUBPIXELS.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.752
THEY'RE UNDENIABLY CONNECTED.

07:48.800 --> 07:52.065
YOU WERE DEFINITELY STANDING
NEXT TO THE WOMAN IN THE PHOTO.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.977
- OH, ANOTHER HAND TURKEY.

08:00.010 --> 08:01.932
THINK THAT MAKES SIX.
- YEAH, IT'S A GOOD THING

08:01.980 --> 08:03.072
THAT SHAWN IS SHARP
IN OTHER AREAS,

08:03.110 --> 08:05.908
BECAUSE HE IS
ARTISTICALLY-CHALLENGED.

08:05.950 --> 08:08.043
- OH, COME ON, THAT'S
NOT BAD FOR A TODDLER.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.514
- HE MADE THAT ONE
LAST THANKSGIVING.

08:17.860 --> 08:21.990
I HOPE THE HE-MAN SHEETS
ARE ACCEPTABLE.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.725
- WOW, SEEMS UNTOUCHED.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.865
- YEAH, I THOUGHT
ABOUT TURNING THE ROOM

08:29.910 --> 08:31.559
INTO SOME SORT OF WORKSPACE,
BUT IN MY CASE

08:31.610 --> 08:33.009
THAT MEANT TARGET PRACTICE.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.928
WHICH DIDN'T
SEEM TOO PRACTICAL.

08:38.910 --> 08:40.946
- [crying softly]
- HEY.

08:40.980 --> 08:42.242
HEY, COME ON, COME ON.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.679
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY,

08:43.720 --> 08:44.982
YOU JUST
WENT THROUGH A TRAUMA,

08:45.020 --> 08:46.817
AND SOMETIMES THE BODY
HAS TO GO INTO SHOCK

08:46.860 --> 08:48.953
BEFORE IT CAN START
TO PROCESS THIS STUFF.

08:48.990 --> 08:50.127
- [sniffles]

08:50.160 --> 08:53.129
I'M NOT CRYING ABOUT THAT.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.151
I'M CRYING BECAUSE
SHAWN BELIEVES ME.

08:55.200 --> 08:59.899
HE'S THE ONLY ONE.
[sniffs]

08:59.940 --> 09:01.931
- THE FAMILY
HAD JUST RETURNED HOME

09:01.970 --> 09:03.733
FROM A TWO WEEK VACATION
IN FORT LAUDERDALE.

09:03.770 --> 09:04.998
- SO?

09:05.040 --> 09:07.975
- SO HE MAY HAVE BEEN THERE
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

09:08.010 --> 09:10.672
- YOUR THEORY IS THAT YIN
BROKE INTO THE HOUSE,

09:10.710 --> 09:12.041
STOLE ALL THE FURNITURE,
ABDUCTED THE GIRL,

09:12.080 --> 09:14.048
THEN MOVED IT ALL BACK IN
ONCE SHE ESCAPED?

09:14.080 --> 09:15.172
YOU SOUND LIKE SPENCER.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.040
- OKAY, I KNOW
IT SOUNDS FARFETCHED,

09:17.090 --> 09:19.650
BUT YIN HAS DONE MORE ELABORATE
THINGS IN THE PAST.

09:19.690 --> 09:22.352
ALLISON COWLEY KNEW THE EXACT
LAYOUT OF THIS HOME.

09:22.390 --> 09:24.051
- SO MAYBE SHE BROKE
INTO THE HOUSE HERSELF

09:24.090 --> 09:26.081
TO LEARN THE LAYOUT.
SHE'S A WHACKJOB!

09:26.130 --> 09:27.290
COME ON, O'HARA.
- LOOK...

09:27.330 --> 09:30.197
I KNOW WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE, OKAY?

09:30.230 --> 09:33.859
I HAVE HEARD HIS VOICE,
I HAVE FELT HIS BREATH, CARLTON.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.197
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

09:35.240 --> 09:37.765
AND I DON'T NEED TO
HEAR IT, OKAY?

09:37.810 --> 09:40.836
IF THIS GIRL IS TELLING
THE TRUTH, SHE NEEDS OUR HELP.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.575
MY HELP.

09:52.420 --> 09:54.615
[creaking and scraping]

10:00.660 --> 10:02.662
[gun clicks]

10:24.990 --> 10:27.686
[gasping]

10:33.830 --> 10:36.253
- OH...
[panﬁng]

10:36.300 --> 10:41.090
[clock chiming]

10:46.310 --> 10:49.404
[walkie-talkie chatter]

10:49.440 --> 10:51.340
[camera clicks]

10:51.380 --> 10:53.177
- I WANT PICTURES OF
EVERY INCH OF THIS ROOM.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.176
WITH THIS GUY,
ANYTHING CAN BE A CLUE.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.211
- THIS CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

10:57.250 --> 10:59.286
IF THIS GIRL DIES, WE
ALL HAVE BLOOD ON OUR HANDS.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.311
- NO, NO, NO, THERE
IS NOTHING DOWN THERE.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.248
I CANNOT BELIEVE I DID NOT
CHECK THIS ROOM FIRST.

11:03.290 --> 11:05.121
- LOOK DAD, YOU FOLLOWED
YOUR INSTINCTS, OKAY?

11:05.160 --> 11:07.151
AND THEY WERE RIGHT.
SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN SAFE HERE.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.827
- THE SON OF A BITCH
WAS IN MY HOUSE,

11:08.860 --> 11:10.168
HE'S GONNA
CONTEND WITH ME NOW.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.827
- HE'S GONNA
CONTEND WITH ALL OF US.

11:11.870 --> 11:14.668
AND I MEAN...ALL OF US.

11:18.140 --> 11:19.903
- YOU REALLY THINK
THIS WILL WORK?

11:19.940 --> 11:21.134
- CERTAINLY WORTH A SHOT.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.944
WE WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT THROUGH
THE LAST ROUND WITHOUT HER.

11:23.980 --> 11:25.004
- WHAT THE...?

11:25.050 --> 11:26.403
- HEY!

11:26.450 --> 11:28.771
LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY WAS A BAD GIRL

11:28.820 --> 11:30.117
AND RAIDED MOMMY'S CLOSET.

11:30.150 --> 11:32.015
- HI, BOYS.

11:32.050 --> 11:35.053
THANK YOU, GREGORY.

11:35.090 --> 11:38.082
SHAWN, SHAWN, SHAWN.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.894
THE PRODIGAL SON RETURNS.

11:40.930 --> 11:42.090
- ARE YOU WEARING MAKEUP?

11:42.130 --> 11:43.427
-IAM.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.791
IT'S PART OF
MY NEW SELF-ESTEEM CLASS.

11:45.830 --> 11:46.797
DO YOU THINK I LOOK PRE'I'I'Y?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.831
- DEPENDS, HOW FAR ALONG
ARE YOU IN THE CLASS?

11:48.870 --> 11:51.100
- YES, WE DO.
WE THINK YOU LOOK LOVELY.

11:51.140 --> 11:53.370
A LOT OF PROGRESS
- I'VE MADE

11:53.410 --> 11:55.173
SINCE THE LAST TIME
WE SAW EACH OTHER, SHAWN.

11:55.210 --> 11:56.507
[sigh]

11:56.540 --> 12:00.112
THEY'RE CALLING ME
A MODEL PRISONER PATIENT.

12:00.150 --> 12:01.777
NO LONGER CONSIDERED
TO BE A DANGER

12:01.820 --> 12:03.185
TO MYSELF OR OTHERS.

12:03.220 --> 12:06.018
EXCEPT FOR THE FAT BITCH
IN THE CAFETERIA

12:06.050 --> 12:06.857
WHO CAN'T GRASP THE CONCEPT

12:06.890 --> 12:10.121
OF A FULL SCOOP
OF MASHED POTATOES.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.220
- WE'RE HERE TO
ASK FOR YOUR HELP AGAIN.

12:13.260 --> 12:16.127
- YOU LOOK
SO MUCH HAPPIER, SHAWN.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.092
ARE YOU SEEING SOMEONE?

12:17.130 --> 12:19.769
- UH, I DON'T REALLY
THINK THAT'S REALLY--

12:19.800 --> 12:22.291
- SHAWN SPENCER
HAS TAKEN A LOVER.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.262
YAY!
[applause]

12:24.310 --> 12:26.232
ABOUT TIME,
WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

12:26.270 --> 12:28.875
- WHY DON'T
YOU TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

12:28.910 --> 12:30.468
- OH, LOOK!

12:31.580 --> 12:33.844
WE LOOKED
SO INNOCENT BACK THEN.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.074
- WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER IT?

12:35.120 --> 12:37.088
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT?

12:38.550 --> 12:41.018
SHAWN, I'M INSULTED.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.118
THIS WAS OUR MOMENT.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.048
- WHERE
WAS THIS PHOTO TAKEN?

12:44.090 --> 12:45.125
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.321
YOU GUYS HAVE TO FIGURE THAT
OUT FOR YOURSELVES.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.021
I'M NOT JUST
GOING TO TELL YOU.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.129
HOW MUCH FUN WOULD
THAT BE?

12:50.170 --> 12:52.024
- YIN HAS
TAKEN ANOTHER VICTIM.

12:52.070 --> 12:54.061
HER NAME IS ALLISON COWLEY.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.465
IF YOU'VE MADE
ALL THIS PROGRESS,

12:55.500 --> 12:56.808
WHY DON'T
YOU PROVE IT TO US?

12:56.840 --> 12:58.068
- IF YOU WANT REDEMPTION,

12:58.110 --> 12:59.873
LEAD US TO YIN
AND HELP US SAVE THIS GIRL.

12:59.910 --> 13:02.105
- COLOR ME INTRIGUED.

13:02.140 --> 13:04.199
- GREAT.
START TALKING.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.048
- NO, SHAWN.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.186
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
I WORK, YOU KNOW THAT.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.017
I'M JUST LIKE YOU.

13:12.050 --> 13:15.053
I NEED TO FEEL, AND TOUCH,
AND SEE THINGS

13:15.090 --> 13:17.058
WITH MY OWN EYES.

13:17.090 --> 13:18.523
TAKE ME TO THE CRIME SCENE.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.096
- OH, COME ON,
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

13:20.130 --> 13:21.290
- NO, ME HOSTING THE VIEW

13:21.330 --> 13:23.924
AND MAKING OUT WITH ELIZABETH
HASSELBECK IS IMPOSSIBLE.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.165
THIS IS NOT.
IT'S NON-NEGOTIABLE.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.531
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME THERE,

13:27.570 --> 13:29.094
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHERE I THINK YIN IS,

13:29.140 --> 13:31.165
WHERE HE'S
HOLDING THE GIRL, ET CETERA.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.030
OTHERWISE, I'M LATE
FOR THE AFTERNOON MOVIE.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.399
THEY'RE
SCREENING CARBON COPY.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.533
I CAN'T RESIST
A YOUNG SUSAN SAINT JAMES.

13:36.580 --> 13:38.309
SPUNKY.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.511
- YEAH,
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.083
LASSIE, HEY.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.247
I NEED A SMALLISH FAVOR.

13:48.090 --> 13:49.887
- YOU REMEMBER A SHIRT
THAT SHAWN HAD AS A KID?

13:49.930 --> 13:52.285
IT WAS A SKY BLUE SHIRT
WITH A DARK BLUE COLLAR.

13:52.330 --> 13:54.218
- HENRY, WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

13:54.260 --> 13:56.057
WHO WOULD REMEMBER
HIS SHIRTS FROM CHILDHOOD?

13:56.100 --> 13:57.499
- I DO.
ALMOST ALL OF THEM.

13:57.530 --> 13:58.963
I JUST DON'T
REMEMBER THIS ONE.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.092
NOW I KNOW
HE STOPPED WEARING SHIRTS

14:00.140 --> 14:02.563
WITH BRAND NAMES ON THEM
RIGHT AFTER HIS NINTH BIRTHDAY.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.033
- WHY DO YOU KNOW THAT?

14:04.070 --> 14:05.264
- BECAUSE WE HAD
AN ARGUMENT ABOUT IT.

14:05.310 --> 14:07.039
HE DIDN'T WANNA PROMOTE PRODUCTS
WITHOUT BEING PAID FOR IT--

14:07.080 --> 14:10.106
MADDY, DO YOU REMEMBER
THE SHIRT OR DON'T YOU?

14:10.150 --> 14:10.969
- WHAT'S GOING ON, HENRY?

14:11.010 --> 14:12.500
YOU SOUND LIKE
A DETECTIVE RIGHT NOW.

14:12.550 --> 14:14.245
- I AM A DETECTIVE.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.948
MADDY, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE ALARMED,

14:17.990 --> 14:19.082
BUT THIS
HAS TO DO WITH YANG.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.587
- DID SHE ESCAPE?

14:20.620 --> 14:22.929
- NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.928
SHE'S SAFE,
SHE'S BEHIND BARS,

14:24.960 --> 14:27.053
IT'S JUST THIS PHOTOGRAPH--
THIS PICTURE...

14:27.100 --> 14:29.056
IT'S NOTHING,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.124
I'M GONNA HANDLE IT ALL.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.592
- LOOK,
IF SHAWN IS IN TROUBLE,

14:31.630 --> 14:33.188
YOU BETTER TELL ME RIGHT NOW--
[Sirens]

14:33.240 --> 14:34.992
- MADDY, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.291
- [sigh]

14:44.110 --> 14:46.340
- WOW.

14:46.380 --> 14:49.178
SO THIS IS
WHERE IT ALL BEGAN.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.485
MAKING SHADOWS
ON THE CEILING DANCE,

14:53.520 --> 14:56.182
COUNTING LITTLE LAMBS
WHILE YOU DRIFTED OFF TO SLEEP.

14:56.220 --> 14:58.120
OH, I WISH I COULD
GO BACK IN TIME.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.196
AND PINCH THOSE
CHUBBY LITTLE CHEEKS,

15:00.230 --> 15:02.095
AND TELL YOU
NOTHING WILL BE OKAY.

15:02.130 --> 15:04.166
- START TALKING, YANG,
OR IT'S BACK TO THE RUBBER ROOM.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.293
- WHAT DOES LASSIE THINK
THIS IS, SHUTTER ISLAND?

15:06.330 --> 15:08.093
- EITHER THAT OR TOOTSIE.
- OKAY, OKAY,

15:08.140 --> 15:11.064
DON'T GET YOUR 19505 BOXERS
IN A TWIST, CARLTON.

15:11.110 --> 15:13.499
COME ON, SHAWN,
LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER.

15:13.540 --> 15:15.132
MM.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.102
YOU MUST'VE CARED
A LOT ABOUT THIS GIRL

15:17.150 --> 15:18.640
TO LET HER
SLEEP IN YOUR BED.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.409
DOES YOUR LOVER KNOW?

15:20.450 --> 15:22.077
- I HAVEN'T
TAKEN A LOVER, OKAY?

15:22.120 --> 15:24.247
BESIDES, MY DAD MADE
THE SLEEPING ARRANGEMENTS.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.144
- OH, AND THEY
CALL ME THE SICK ONE?

15:27.220 --> 15:28.983
THE GIRL WASN'T
DRAGGED OUT OF HERE,

15:29.020 --> 15:31.124
SHE WAS LIFTED OUT.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.354
WAS SHE DRUGGED?

15:32.390 --> 15:34.290
- CSI SAID THEY
FOUND AN ALCOHOL SWAB.

15:34.330 --> 15:37.128
- SO HE WAS GENTLE WITH HER.
WHY?

15:39.400 --> 15:42.039
- HE TOLD ME I WAS SPECIAL.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.129
- SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ABOUT THIS ONE.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.205
SHE'S SPECIAL.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.334
- EXACTLY, SHAWN.
SEE HOW WELL WE WORK TOGETHER?

15:48.380 --> 15:49.631
- SO MAYBE
HE WON'T KILL HER.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.739
- OH, NO, HE IS
DEFINITELY GOING TO KILL HER.

15:51.780 --> 15:54.078
HE'S JUST GOT
SOMETHING SPECIAL PLANNED.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.076
SOMETHING FIT
FOR A GRAND FINALE.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.587
- SO WHERE WOULD
HE HAVE TAKEN HER?

15:57.620 --> 16:01.078
- SADLY, I HAVE NOT
BEEN IN CONTACT WITH YIN.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.553
SURPRISE, SURPRISE,
HE HASN'T VISITED ME

16:02.590 --> 16:04.023
DURING MY INCARCERATION.

16:04.060 --> 16:05.652
- THEN WHY THE HELL
DID WE BRING YOU HERE?

16:05.690 --> 16:09.558
- BECAUSE SHAWN AND I HAVE
A ROMANTIC HISTORY TOGETHER.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.693
AND I DESERVE
TO SEE HIS BEDROOM.

16:11.730 --> 16:13.766
- THAT'S IT.
THIS CIRCUS IS OVER.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.064
LET'S GO.
- OKAY, OW!

16:16.100 --> 16:19.160
GOSH. FINE.

16:19.210 --> 16:23.169
SOMETIMES IT ISN'T SOMETHING
HE LEAVES BEHIND, THE CLUE.

16:23.210 --> 16:26.600
SOMETIMES IT'S SOMETHING
HE TAKES WITH HIM.

16:26.650 --> 16:29.073
SHAWN.
- WHAT?

16:29.120 --> 16:31.008
I'VE BEEN IN THIS ROOM TWICE
IN THE LAST 15 YEARS,

16:31.050 --> 16:32.779
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
IF SOMETHING'S MISSING?

16:32.820 --> 16:35.209
- SHAWN, THINK.
USE YOUR GIFT.

16:35.260 --> 16:38.252
GO BACK IN TIME AND SE--
SENSE THE WAY THINGS WERE.

16:38.290 --> 16:39.052
- WHAT DOES THIS POSSIBLY

16:39.090 --> 16:40.591
HAVE TO DO
WITH BARBRA STREISAND?

16:40.630 --> 16:42.097
- FOCUS.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.283
- ONE OF MY ARMY MEN.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.151
IT'S FACING
THE WRONG DIRECTION.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.750
IT'S POINTING AT MY VINYL.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.722
MEAT IS MURDER,
BY THE SMITHS,

17:18.770 --> 17:21.159
1984, VAN HALEN--
BOTH MISSING.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.235
- ARE YOU SURE?

17:22.270 --> 17:24.602
- OF COURSE I'M SURE,
THEY'RE CLEARLY IN ORDER.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.699
- TEARS FOR FEARS, DEPECHE MODE,
THOMPSON TWINS,

17:26.740 --> 17:27.900
WHAT ORDER ARE YOU USING?
- SWEETNESS.

17:27.940 --> 17:30.443
- MEN WITHOUT HATS IS COOLER
THAN ECHO AND THE BUNNYMEN?

17:30.480 --> 17:31.504
- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

17:31.550 --> 17:33.643
WHERE ARE DEVO AND
THE TALKING HEADS IN ALL THIS?

17:33.680 --> 17:36.513
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST
THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND.

17:36.550 --> 17:39.485
MEAT IS MURDER, FIRST TRACK,
THE HEADMASTER RITUAL.

17:39.520 --> 17:43.524
SECOND TRACK...
WAIT A SECOND.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.425
1984 HAS
HOT FOR TEACHER.

17:45.460 --> 17:48.224
TH E H EADMASTER,
TEACHER...

17:48.260 --> 17:50.626
- I LIVE IN
AN APARTMENT OFF-CAMPUS.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.358
- I'M SENSING THAT
THIS IS ABOUT HER TEACHER.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.165
- SAVE FERRIS.
SAVE FERRIS.

17:59.210 --> 18:01.132
AWESOME, GREAT.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.602
- HEY, THIS IS
ALLISON'S CLASS SCHEDULE.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.278
MAYBE YOU CAN...

18:06.380 --> 18:09.144
- 'CAUSE SHAWN AND I HAVE
A ROMANTIC HISTORY TOGETHER,

18:09.180 --> 18:11.216
AND I DESERVE
TO SEE HIS BEDROOM.

18:12.620 --> 18:15.214
- HEY, SIMOLEUM BUILDING,
LECTURE HALL C, WHERE IS IT?

18:15.260 --> 18:16.887
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

18:16.920 --> 18:20.151
- OH, NO, I'M NOT.
NOT VERY OFTEN!

18:20.200 --> 18:22.555
- IF YOU HIT LECTURE HALL D,
YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR!

18:24.800 --> 18:29.191
[footsteps approaching]

18:29.240 --> 18:30.639
- KARL ROTMENSEN!

18:30.670 --> 18:32.399
YOU'RE WANTED FOR QUESTIONING
IN THE ABDUCTION OF--

18:32.440 --> 18:34.738
- I'M NOT KARL ROTMENSEN,
I'M JUST HIS SUBSTITUTE.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.008
- WHERE IS HE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.406
I DON'T KNOW, I WAS JUST GIVEN
HIS LESSON TO COPY ON THE BOARD.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.315
- LET ME SEE SOME I.D.
IT'S OKAY.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.544
"A WILY PRINCE NAMED SPENCERTON
ATTEMPTS TO SAVE LADY ALLISON

18:46.590 --> 18:48.478
"FROM THE EVIL CLUTCHES
OF THE HANDSOME,

18:48.520 --> 18:50.556
BUT VICIOUS LORD YIN."
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

18:50.590 --> 18:53.229
- IT'S AN EXERCISE,
A WRITING ESSAY.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.420
THE STUDENTS CAN WRITE
THE DETAILS OF THE STORY

18:54.460 --> 18:56.428
ANYWAY THEY WANT BUT THEY
ALL HAVE TO USE THE SAME ENDING.

18:56.460 --> 18:57.495
- WHAT IS THE ENDING?

18:57.530 --> 18:59.191
- THE GIRL DIES.
IT'S A REAL DOWNER.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.633
- PROFESSOR ROTMENSEN HAS NOT
SHOWN UP FOR HIS LECTURE

19:07.680 --> 19:09.773
SINCE LAST WEEK,
SO WE BROUGHT IN A SUB.

19:09.810 --> 19:12.199
HE NEVER CALLED IN SICK
AND WE NEVER HEARD FROM HIM.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.741
- YOU NEVER NOTICED
ANYTHING STRANGE ABOUT HIM?

19:14.780 --> 19:16.748
ANY ODD BEHAVIOR?
- IF YOU'RE ASKING ME

19:16.780 --> 19:18.645
IF HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF
LIKE A SERIAL KILLER,

19:18.690 --> 19:20.453
RUNNING AROUND
WITH SHRUNKEN HEADS,

19:20.490 --> 19:23.459
OR WEARING STUDENTS' SKIN
AS A DRESS, THEN NO.

19:23.490 --> 19:25.321
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT MAN

19:25.360 --> 19:27.726
WHO WAS EITHER TENURED
OR AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR

19:27.760 --> 19:30.399
AT EVERY PRESTIGIOUS
INSTITUTION IN CALIFORNIA.

19:30.430 --> 19:31.795
WE WERE LUCKY TO GET HIM.

19:31.830 --> 19:34.230
- I'D HOLD OFF ON NAMING
A LIBRARY AFTER HIM JUST YET.

19:34.270 --> 19:36.295
- I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAVE
AN ADDRESS FOR HIM ON FILE?

19:36.340 --> 19:38.831
- THIS IS THE
ONLY ADDRESS ON FILE.

19:38.870 --> 19:41.532
- THANK YOU, YOU'VE
BEEN VERY UNHELPFUL.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.457
- I SHOULD'VE
REMEMBERED THE SHIRT.

19:54.490 --> 19:56.219
I SHOULD'VE
REMEMBERED A LOT OF THINGS.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.581
- LOOK, MADDY, I--
- I GOT ON A PLANE,

19:58.630 --> 20:01.451
AND I FLEW HERE, AND NOW
I'M STANDING HERE IN YOUR HOUSE.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.821
THIS IS WHERE YOU MAKE ME
A POT OF YOUR HORRENDOUS COFFEE.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.861
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG NIGHT.

20:05.900 --> 20:06.924
- THESE ARE
ALL THE PHOTOGRAPHS

20:06.970 --> 20:08.494
I TOOK THAT SUMMER
WITH MY CAMERA.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.838
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
EVERYTHING, TWICE, THREE TIMES,

20:10.870 --> 20:12.406
I JUST CAN'T FIND A MATCH.
[door opens]

20:12.440 --> 20:13.930
- MOM!

20:13.980 --> 20:15.629
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:15.680 --> 20:17.375
- GOOSE.

20:17.410 --> 20:19.344
YOUR FATHER CALLED ME.

20:19.380 --> 20:20.813
I CAME HERE TO HELP.

20:20.850 --> 20:22.670
- DAD, WHY IN THE HELL WOULD--
- SHAWN,

20:22.720 --> 20:24.642
SHE FIGURED IT OUT,
SHE'S HERE NOW, OKAY?

20:24.690 --> 20:25.816
LET'S FOCUS
ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.556
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO THIS TOGETHER.

20:29.890 --> 20:30.879
- GUS,
JULIET...

20:30.930 --> 20:33.490
DETECTIVE LASSITER.
- DOCTOR.

20:33.530 --> 20:34.952
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.592
WE GOT AN ADDRESS FOR YIN.

20:36.630 --> 20:37.722
IT WAS A FIELD.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.964
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE FIELD WAS A BOX,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.639
INSIDE THE BOX
WAS SOME VHS TAPES.

20:41.670 --> 20:43.934
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S ON THEM,
BUT WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

20:45.710 --> 20:47.007
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HE
LED US TO A CARDBOARD BOX

20:47.040 --> 20:48.473
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD.

20:48.510 --> 20:50.478
THAT'S SUCH
A BLATANT RIP-OFF OF SE7EN.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.546
- WE GOT LUCKY, IT COULD'VE
BEEN GWYNETH PALTROW'S HEAD.

20:52.580 --> 20:53.911
- GOOD THING YOU
STILL HAD A VCR, SHAWN.

20:53.950 --> 20:55.975
- I'VE GOT
A LASER DISC PLAYER TOO.

20:56.020 --> 20:58.011
GUS STILL
HAS HIS LITE-BRITE.

21:06.630 --> 21:08.393
- [sigh]

21:08.430 --> 21:10.523
HEY, SHAWN.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.867
GUSTER.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.936
SO A LOT OF THIS STUFF
IS JUST GONNA BE, YOU KNOW,

21:13.970 --> 21:15.961
JUST SOME RANDOM THOUGHTS
THAT I'M HAVING.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.709
IDEAS... THERE'LL BE
A LOT OF MY PERSONAL POETRY,

21:19.740 --> 21:23.949
AND THERE'LL BE SOME
OBSERVATIONS ON YIN AND YANG.

21:23.980 --> 21:25.709
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

21:25.750 --> 21:27.775
- IT'S HIS VIDEO DIARIES.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.572
YIN MUST'VE STOLEN IT
FROM MARY'S APARTMENT

21:29.620 --> 21:30.814
WHEN HE BROKE IN LAST YEAR.

21:30.850 --> 21:31.942
- HE KEPT THEM
THIS WHOLE TIME?

21:31.990 --> 21:33.810
- I SUSPECT FOR
THIS PRECISE MOMENT,

21:33.860 --> 21:34.986
TO HELP US FIND HIM.

21:35.020 --> 21:36.817
- YOU'RE SAYING
HE WANTED US TO FIND HIM?

21:36.860 --> 21:38.748
- YEAH, I'VE
BEEN THINKING WHY ELSE

21:38.790 --> 21:40.758
TAKE SOMEONE
SO CLOSE TO HOME?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.097
THIS FEELS
LIKE AN EXIT STRATEGY.

21:42.130 --> 21:43.927
- IN OTHER WORDS,
IF WE DON'T CATCH HIM NOW,

21:43.970 --> 21:45.961
WE DON'T CATCH HIM.
- THEN LET'S PAY ATTENTION.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.797
- DAY ONE, HOUR ONE.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.831
WHAT IS THE DEAL
WITH ONE TREE HILL?

21:49.870 --> 21:52.031
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:52.070 --> 21:55.335
IT'S LIKE A POORLY-EXECUTED
DAWSON'S CREEK.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.075
WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT?

21:57.110 --> 22:00.045
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED
ON CHAD MICHAEL MURRAY.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.071
TOO LATE,
I'M GONNA START IN.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.509
HE HAS DEAD EYES.
[static]

22:04.550 --> 22:07.110
JASPER PEAKS,
ARROWS AND BOWS...

22:07.150 --> 22:08.811
- IS HE WEARING
A MONKEY ASCOT?

22:08.860 --> 22:10.782
- IT'S A MONKSCOT.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.492
- THE TICKLE OF
A GOOD FRIEND'S NOSE,

22:13.530 --> 22:15.748
AND A TUM TUM
FILLED WITH SPAGHETTIOS.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.792
[high-pitched voice]

22:24.170 --> 22:25.933
- SPENCER, WHEN DO
WE TURN THIS CRAP OFF?

22:25.970 --> 22:28.632
- THERE HAS TO BE A CLUE
BURIED IN HERE SOMEWHERE FOR ME.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.908
THERE HAS TO BE.

22:31.980 --> 22:33.379
WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.069
THAT'S DATED TWO NIGHTS
BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED.

22:36.750 --> 22:39.981
- NO, MARIAN.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.556
OKAY, SHAWN...

22:41.590 --> 22:43.626
STRING CHEESE RIGHT NOW,
I MIGHT BE LOOPY ON TOO MUCH

22:43.660 --> 22:45.389
BUT I THINK I JUST
REALIZED SOMETHING.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.921
THE REASON
THAT YANG'S BOOK RANG FALSE

22:47.960 --> 22:52.090
COULD BE...'CAUSE
SHE'S A PAWN IN ALL THIS, OKAY.

22:52.130 --> 22:54.837
SHE EXHIBITS CHARACTERISTICS
THAT ARE WAY MORE

22:54.870 --> 22:58.738
INDICATIVE OF A VICTIM
THAN AN AGGRESSOR, ALL RIGHT?

22:58.770 --> 23:01.807
AND WE KNOW SHE DIDN'T
DO IT ALONE, RIGHT?

23:01.840 --> 23:03.876
MAYBE SHE
DIDN'T DO IT AT ALL.

23:03.910 --> 23:07.516
I JUST THINK YIN IS VERY, VERY
ANGRY WITH HER FOR BEING CAUGHT.

23:07.550 --> 23:09.518
MAYBE EVEN
JEALOUS OF THE INFAMY.

23:09.550 --> 23:12.485
SHAWN, I THINK YIN'S
ABOUT TO TAKE REVENGE

23:12.520 --> 23:14.078
OF THE HIGHEST MALEVOLENCE.

23:14.120 --> 23:17.055
AND I'M WORRIED.

23:17.090 --> 23:19.888
- HENRY, WAIT A MINUTE.

23:19.930 --> 23:21.056
- WHAT?
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

23:21.100 --> 23:22.897
- REMEMBER THAT INSTAMATIC
YOU BOUGHT ME

23:22.930 --> 23:25.569
FOR MY PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS?

23:25.600 --> 23:27.932
TH ESE ARE
THE PICTURES I TOOK.

23:30.940 --> 23:32.908
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

23:32.940 --> 23:35.204
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S HER.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.777
- WHOSE CAR WAS THIS?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

23:37.810 --> 23:39.869
- I THINK
THAT CGI HAS RUINED

23:39.910 --> 23:41.446
MOVIE STORY-TELLING
FOR ALL OF US.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.970
- IS HE WEARING A ONESIE?
- YES.

23:43.020 --> 23:45.887
- I DON'T WANNA SAY IT'S
COMPLETELY MICHAEL BAY'S FAULT,

23:45.920 --> 23:48.150
BUT THAT GUY NEEDS TO BE STOPPED
'CAUSE IT'S ALL HIS FAULT.

23:50.860 --> 23:53.055
- WHOA, WHOA.
THAT'S ALLISON.

23:53.090 --> 23:54.694
WHERE IS SHE?

23:54.730 --> 23:57.153
- THOSE STAIRS SEEM TO INDICATE
A BASEMENT SOMEWHERE.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.931
- I WAS OUT LOOKING FOR SHAWN
BECAUSE HE WAS LATE FOR DINNER.

24:00.970 --> 24:01.789
AND IT WAS STARTING TO RAIN.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.638
I FOUND HIM ON HIS BIKE,
AND I MET HER.

24:04.670 --> 24:06.809
SHE ASKED IF SHE COULD
HAVE HER PICTURE TAKEN WITH HIM.

24:06.840 --> 24:07.909
- AND YOU LET HER?

24:07.940 --> 24:09.476
- SHE SEEMED SO SAD.

24:09.510 --> 24:12.638
SHE SAID SHAWN WAS
THE LUCKIEST, MOST HANDSOME BOY

24:12.680 --> 24:14.910
SHE'D EVER SEEN, AND THAT
HE HAD KINDNESS IN HIS EYES.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.247
I FELT SO BAD FOR HER.

24:18.550 --> 24:19.847
I PUT THE PICTURE
IN THE MAILBOX,

24:19.890 --> 24:20.982
I NEVER KNEW
SHE EVER GOT IT.

24:21.020 --> 24:22.817
- YEAH, WELL,
NOW WE KNOW SHE DID.

24:22.860 --> 24:25.556
SHAWN!
SHAWN, GET DOWN HERE!

24:28.760 --> 24:31.092
WE FOUND IT.
YOUR MOM TOOK THIS PHOTOGRAPH.

24:31.130 --> 24:32.995
IT'S A HOUSE,
IT'S OVER ON GRAYSON STREET.

24:33.030 --> 24:34.065
- GRAYSON STREET?

24:39.640 --> 24:41.574
- OH, MY GOD.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.907
THAT WAS YANG?

24:42.940 --> 24:44.976
THIS WHOLE THING
STARTED TH REE BLOCKS AWAY.

24:45.010 --> 24:46.147
COME ON, GUS!
- NO, SHAWN--

24:46.180 --> 24:47.738
SHAWN, GET BACK!
SHAWN, GET--

24:47.780 --> 24:48.940
DAMN IT, SHAWN.

24:48.980 --> 24:50.743
- WHERE THE HELL
IS GRAYSON STREET?

24:50.790 --> 24:52.143
- DAMN IT, SHAWN!
MADDY, STAY HERE,

24:52.190 --> 24:54.112
LOCK BOTH DOORS,
DO NOT LEAVE.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.893
- THE FLAG'S UP.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.871
"SHAWN AND THE SALESMAN,

25:15.910 --> 25:17.844
"THE KEY'S UNDER THE MAT,
WIPE YOUR FEET,

25:17.880 --> 25:19.905
COME ALONE
OR THE GIRL DIES."

25:19.950 --> 25:22.271
- SHAWN...
- WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE, GUS.

25:31.030 --> 25:35.854
[locks snap]

25:35.900 --> 25:37.151
- WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

25:37.200 --> 25:38.758
IS THIS ABOUT SHAWN?
- THAT'S YOUR MOM'S VOICE.

25:38.800 --> 25:39.721
- IS HE OKAY?

25:39.770 --> 25:41.897
LOOK, IF SHAWN IS IN TROUBLE...
- [mumbles]

25:41.940 --> 25:43.965
- YOU BETTER TELL ME
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I--

25:44.010 --> 25:45.329
HENRY?
- HE MUST'VE TAPPED

25:45.370 --> 25:47.907
MY DAD'S PHONE
AND RECORDED IT.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.979
- HENRY.
HENRY, BACKUP'S ON THE WAY!

26:09.830 --> 26:10.865
- [whispers]
ALLISON.

26:14.070 --> 26:16.698
WHERE IS HE?

26:16.740 --> 26:18.162
IT'S OKAY, WE'RE
GONNA GET YOU OUTTA HERE.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.962
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

26:20.010 --> 26:22.035
- SHAWN,
NOTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

26:32.990 --> 26:36.255
- OH, MY GOD.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.758
- I TOLD HIM THAT I DIDN'T
THINK YOU WOULD TAKE THE BAIT.

26:38.790 --> 26:40.951
BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHY
HE'S THE MASTER.

26:42.860 --> 26:44.293
AND I'M THE APPRENTICE.

26:44.330 --> 26:47.026
[gun clicks]

26:47.070 --> 26:49.129
WHAT DO YOU SAY I GIVE YOU
A TOUR OF THE HOUSE?

26:55.980 --> 26:57.709
- ALLISON, DON'T DO THIS.

26:57.750 --> 26:58.978
YOU HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED.

26:59.010 --> 27:00.773
PUT THE GUN DOWN,
YOU COULD STILL HAVE A LIFE.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.242
- SAVE IT, PYRAMUS.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.646
YOU WERE SO EASY.

27:04.690 --> 27:07.045
ALL I'VE HEARD IS,
"HE'S SO WORTHY.

27:07.090 --> 27:10.924
MY GREATEST FOE..."
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.929
I BUST OUT THE
POUTY LIPS AND PUFFY EYES,

27:19.700 --> 27:21.031
- OH!
- GO ON.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.932
MOVE.
SIT, UBU, SIT.

27:28.810 --> 27:29.936
GO ON.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.014
- OW, WH--
OW.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.808
- OW.

27:39.850 --> 27:40.987
- THERE'S NO WAY IN.

27:41.020 --> 27:43.727
THIS PLACE
IS LIKE FORT KNOX.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.978
CARLTON!
IT WAS IN THE MAILBOX.

27:49.030 --> 27:50.054
- SON OF A BITCH!

27:50.100 --> 27:51.226
- CALL FOR THE RAM.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.158
- THAT'LL
JUST ABOUT DO IT.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.929
I'D LIKE TO THANK MR. YIN

27:54.970 --> 27:56.289
FOR LETTING ME
OPEN UP FOR HIM TONIGHT.

27:56.340 --> 27:57.967
IT'S BEEN A BLAST.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.228
I'VE GOT T-SHIRTS AND IRON-ONS
FOR SALE IN THE LOBBY.

28:00.270 --> 28:01.806
- DO YOU REMEMBER
THE PRECISE MOMENT

28:01.840 --> 28:03.205
THAT YOU KNEW YOU
WERE A COMPLETE PSYCHOPATH?

28:03.240 --> 28:04.798
- SHAWN.
- NO, I'M INTERESTED.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.909
WAS IT GRADUAL, OR DID
YOU JUST WAKE UP ONE MORNING,

28:06.950 --> 28:09.043
LOOK IN THE MIRROR, AND SEE
THE CHIMP FROM MONKEY SHINES?

28:09.080 --> 28:11.480
- MS. COWLEY,
YOU'RE EXCUSED.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.044
- WHAT?

28:13.090 --> 28:14.216
NO WAY AM I MISSING THIS.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.216
I DID EVERYTHING
THAT YOU ASKED ME TO.

28:16.260 --> 28:18.228
I WAS PERFECT.
I DESERVE THIS.

28:18.260 --> 28:20.421
- I WON'T ASK AGAIN.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.929
WELL?
FIRST IMPRESSIONS?

28:36.980 --> 28:38.447
- HIDEOUS.
- ARCANE.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.948
- I MUST APOLOGIZE
FOR THE LACK OF DECORUM

28:40.980 --> 28:43.016
ON THE PART OF
MY NEW COLLEAGUE.

28:43.050 --> 28:44.517
KIDS, YOU KNOW,
THESE DAYS.

28:44.550 --> 28:47.383
HOWEVER THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE
FOR ENTHUSIASM,

28:47.420 --> 28:49.012
AND HERS IS OFF THE CHARTS.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.858
EVEN I SHUDDER TO THINK
WHAT SHE'LL BE CAPABLE OF

28:51.890 --> 28:55.428
ONCE I PASS OFF
THE PROVERBIAL BATON.

28:55.460 --> 29:00.466
IF ONLY YOUR GOOD FRIEND YANG
HAD BEEN AS PASSIONATE.

29:00.500 --> 29:03.958
OH, WELL, NO USE
CRYING OVER SPILLED SODA.

29:05.240 --> 29:08.232
- UH, WHAT IS GOING
INSIDE THE SYRINGE?

29:08.280 --> 29:11.943
- YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
TWO FAMOUS 15TH CENTURY KNIGHTS

29:11.980 --> 29:13.049
OF THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE--

29:13.080 --> 29:16.208
I BELIEVE THEY WERE FROM
THE ESTE FAMILY OF FERRARA--

29:16.250 --> 29:20.914
MET THEIR DEATHS
IN THOSE TWO VERY CHAIRS.

29:20.960 --> 29:21.949
- REALLY?

29:21.990 --> 29:24.185
- NO, I FOUND THEM
AT A FLEA MARKET IN OXNARD.

29:24.230 --> 29:27.324
BUT DON'T WORRY, SHAWN, TONIGHT
WE'LL BE MAKING OUR OWN

29:27.360 --> 29:30.124
NEW STYLE OF HISTORY.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.094
- ARE YOU IGNORING
MY QUESTION ON PURPOSE?

29:32.130 --> 29:33.267
- GUS, DO
YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW?

29:33.300 --> 29:34.836
- YES, SHAWN,
I'M VERY PARTICULAR

29:34.870 --> 29:35.962
ABOUT WHAT
GOES INTO MY BODY.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.059
- IT'S PROBABLY SAFE TO
ASSUME IT'S SOMETHING LETHAL.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.805
IS THAT ACCURATE?

29:39.840 --> 29:41.376
- A BOX OF MARS BARS
TO YOU, SHAWN.

29:42.980 --> 29:44.072
- HOW MUCH LONGER
ARE WE GONNA WAIT?

29:44.110 --> 29:46.305
- IT'S NOT MY CALL, WHAT
THE HELL DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

29:46.350 --> 29:48.272
- THIS IS WRONG.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.015
- O'HARA, EVERY FIBER OF
MY BEING TELLS ME

29:50.050 --> 29:50.744
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

29:50.780 --> 29:52.281
- IT'S
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE

29:52.320 --> 29:54.584
THAT YIN
HASN'T PLANNED FOR, CHIEF.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.087
- THERE'S A HIDDEN
STORM CELLAR.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.054
I CAN GET YOU INTO
THE HOUSE ON TWO CONDITIONS.

29:58.090 --> 30:00.058
- YOU'RE IN NO POSITION
TO NEGOTIATE TERMS.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.024
- WHAT ARE THEY?

30:02.060 --> 30:05.461
- ONE, I GO IN WITH YOU ALONE,
YOU NEED ME TO NAVIGATE.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.468
ANYTHING MORE AND HE'S GONNA
KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP TO,

30:07.500 --> 30:09.866
IF HE DOESN'T ALREADY.
- WHAT'S NUMBER TWO?

30:09.900 --> 30:11.106
- I GET ANOTHER
PICTURE WITH SHAWN,

30:11.140 --> 30:12.505
THE OTHER ONE
IS JUST TOO OLD.

30:12.540 --> 30:14.906
- O'HARA, LISTEN TO ME,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

30:14.940 --> 30:17.875
- YES, I DO.

30:17.910 --> 30:20.913
STAY HERE, CARLTON.

30:20.950 --> 30:23.942
- GIRL TIME!

30:29.660 --> 30:34.029
OKAY, THIS IS AS FAR AS I GO
UNLESS THE SHACKLES COME OFF.

30:34.060 --> 30:37.052
- NOT HAPPENING.
THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE DEAL.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.989
- DEALS ARE MEANT TO BE BROKEN,
AREN'T THEY, JULIET?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.036
SHAWN HAS SUCH KIND EYES,
DON'T YOU THINK?

30:45.070 --> 30:47.630
- WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

30:47.670 --> 30:49.638
- YOU DON'T TRUST ME.
- OF COURSE NOT.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.568
- WELL, YOU SHOULD.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.202
I'M THE ONLY CHANCE
YOUR BOYFRIEND HAS

30:53.250 --> 30:54.569
OF GETTING
OUT OF HERE ALIVE.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.612
[metal clanging,
struggling noises]

31:00.190 --> 31:03.079
FOLLOW ME!

31:10.330 --> 31:11.991
- NOW TO ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION, BURTON,

31:12.030 --> 31:13.964
WHAT WE HAVE HERE
IS A LITTLE CONCOCT ION

31:14.000 --> 31:17.492
I AFFECT IONATELY
COINED "THE LAST KISS."

31:17.540 --> 31:19.565
ONE PART CYANIDE,
ONE PART STRYCHNINE,

31:19.610 --> 31:22.238
TWO PARTS ATROPINE,
WITH JUST A SHAKE--

31:22.280 --> 31:25.101
NOT STIRRED--
OF BOAT CLEANER.

31:25.150 --> 31:27.641
AND IT'S ALL FOR YOU.

31:27.680 --> 31:30.046
- THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.911
I CAN'T WATCH HIM DIE,
YOU'LL HAVE TO KILL ME FIRST.

31:31.950 --> 31:33.281
- YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND

31:33.320 --> 31:34.981
IF YOU THINK
I'M GONNA SIT HERE AND DIE

31:35.020 --> 31:37.011
AFTER WATCHING YOU DIE
WITH SOME RIDICULOUS GRIN

31:37.060 --> 31:38.322
ON YOUR FACE BECAUSE
YOU'RE THINKING OF SOPAPILLAS,

31:38.360 --> 31:39.657
OR THAT STUPID SCENE
FROM SUMMER SCHOOL

31:39.690 --> 31:41.999
WHERE THE STUDENTS
ALL PRETEND TO BE DEAD.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.520
AND DO YOU HAVE
JUST THE ONE NEEDLE?

31:43.560 --> 31:45.699
DO YOU PLAN ON STERILIZING
IN BETWEEN USES?

31:45.730 --> 31:46.662
- SURELY
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.930
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE ALL
YOU'VE BEEN, SHAWN.

31:54.110 --> 31:55.577
- OKAY, CHIEF,
EVERYTHING IS FINE

31:55.610 --> 31:57.942
WE ARE INSIDE THE HOUSE.

32:05.190 --> 32:08.159
[rock music plays]

32:08.190 --> 32:11.182
*

32:17.100 --> 32:18.067
ALLISON?

32:20.030 --> 32:22.066
- DETECTIVE O'HARA.

32:23.100 --> 32:25.034
- UH, CHIEF,
I HAVE ALLISON.

32:25.070 --> 32:26.731
SHE'S OKAY,
I'M GONNA BRING HER OUT.

32:26.770 --> 32:28.237
ALLISON, ARE YOU HURT?

32:28.280 --> 32:29.577
- NO.
- HERE, GIVE ME THE GUN,

32:29.610 --> 32:31.669
GIVE ME THE GUN. DO YOU
KNOW WHERE THE OTHERS ARE?

32:31.710 --> 32:33.007
CAN YOU TAKE ME TO THEM?

32:33.050 --> 32:34.278
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHAWN AND GUS ARE.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.209
HE DRUGGED ME WITH SOMETHING,
I JUST WOKE UP, I DON'T KNOW.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.013
- OKAY, OKAY,
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

32:39.050 --> 32:40.210
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE,

32:40.250 --> 32:42.457
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU OUT
RIGHT NOW.

32:52.330 --> 32:54.730
- DON'T STOP, PLEASE.
YOU GOTTA GET ME OUTTA HERE.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.729
- YOU SAID YOU
JUST WOKE UP, ALLISON.

32:58.770 --> 33:01.375
- YEAH, HE DRUGGED ME
OR SOMETHING.

33:01.410 --> 33:02.536
- SO HOW DID YOU KNOW

33:02.580 --> 33:04.241
THAT SHAWN AND GUS
WERE IN THIS HOUSE?

33:04.280 --> 33:08.046
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING--

33:08.080 --> 33:12.540
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

33:12.590 --> 33:15.150
- NOT BAD FOR A BLONDE.

33:15.190 --> 33:18.159
[slap]
- [soft groan]

33:18.190 --> 33:24.129
[struggling]

33:32.110 --> 33:33.532
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WE LOST CONTACT.

33:33.570 --> 33:35.128
- WHAT?
- O'HARA!

33:35.180 --> 33:38.069
BREAK DOWN THE WALLS,
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

33:38.110 --> 33:41.079
[struggling]

33:41.120 --> 33:43.315
AH! AH!

33:43.350 --> 33:46.342
[board clanks]

33:48.560 --> 33:50.448
- SINCE WHEN AM I
AN UNCLEAN PERSON?

33:50.490 --> 33:52.481
- YOU RODE HALFWAY AROUND
THE WORLD ON A MOTORCYCLE

33:52.530 --> 33:54.589
WITH A BUMPER STICKER
THAT SAID "PUCKER UP AND BLOW."

33:54.630 --> 33:56.723
- IT WAS A LITTLE CARTOON TUBA.
- WITH HUMAN LIPS.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.091
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

33:58.130 --> 33:59.768
YOU TWO ARE INSUFFERABLE.

34:04.570 --> 34:08.836
[glass shattering]
- [soft groan]

34:08.880 --> 34:13.601
- DON'T YOU EVEN BREATHE.

34:13.650 --> 34:15.675

GETS THE NEEDLE,

34:15.720 --> 34:19.588
I HAVE SOMETHING FAR MORE
COLORFUL IN MIND FOR YOU, SHAWN.

34:19.620 --> 34:20.848
- FIRING SQUAD?

34:20.890 --> 34:22.755
PLEASE SAY FIRING SQUAD.

34:22.790 --> 34:24.655
- I DON'T BLAME YOU, SHAWN.

34:24.690 --> 34:26.385
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT...

34:26.430 --> 34:28.523
THAT IF I HAD A CHANCE
TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN,

34:28.560 --> 34:30.050
I WOULDN'T CHANGE
A THING.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.624
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND
AND WE GOT A CHANCE

34:33.670 --> 34:34.830
TO LIVE OUT
OUR CHILDHOOD DREAMS.

34:34.870 --> 34:37.464
I DON'T BLAME YOU,
OKAY?

34:37.500 --> 34:38.762
AND I'M SORRY
IF I COULDN'T ALWAYS

34:38.810 --> 34:41.802
CUT LOOSE
THE WAY YOU WANTED ME TO.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.149
- YOU KILL HIM, I KILL YOU,
YOU GOT IT?

34:44.180 --> 34:46.307
- THAT RACE
DONE DID RUN, BABY.

34:46.350 --> 34:47.806
- NO, SHOULDN'T
YOU BE LAUNCHING INTO

34:47.850 --> 34:49.112
SOME KIND
OF SOLILOQUY, HUH?

34:49.150 --> 34:50.674
ABOUT WHY YOU DO
THE THINGS THAT YOU DO,

34:50.720 --> 34:52.585
AND WHY YOU PICKED ME,
AND ALL THAT STUFF?

34:52.620 --> 34:54.815
I MEAN, I THINK I DESERVE
AN EXPLANATION HERE.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.714
- YOU'RE STALLING,
IT'S BENEATH YOU.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.728
- NO, HE ISN'T, WE JUST
APPRECIATE A LITTLE CLOSURE

34:58.760 --> 35:00.751
BEFORE WE SAY GOOD-BYE TO
GROVER'S CORNERS ONE LAST TIME.

35:00.790 --> 35:02.451
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WHOA-WHOA-WHOA, WHAT IS THAT?

35:02.500 --> 35:04.491
WHAT IS THAT,
A SESAME STREET REFERENCE?

35:04.530 --> 35:05.690
- NO, SHAWN.

35:05.730 --> 35:07.664
YOU WANT TO TELL US,
YOU CAN'T HELP IT.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.463
IT'S CALLED
SERIAL KILLER'S PREROGATIVE.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.162
YOU CAN'T RESIST,
IT'S PROTOCOL.

35:12.210 --> 35:14.770
- VERY GOOD,
DON CHEADLE, JUNIOR.

35:14.810 --> 35:16.505
I DIDN'T LURE THE TWO OF YOU
YES, I SUPPOSE

35:16.540 --> 35:19.668
TO FLASH YOU MY FOLKSY SMILE.
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE JUST

35:19.710 --> 35:21.814

SO TEXT BOOK.

35:21.850 --> 35:22.839

35:22.880 --> 35:25.644
- OVERBEARING MOMMY
LOCK YOU IN A CLOSET, HUH?

MEMORIZE EPISODES
OF PERFECT STRANGERS

35:29.920 --> 35:33.151
LINE FOR LINE?
- NONE OF THE ABOVE, FREUD-ZOID.

35:33.190 --> 35:34.623
I COULD'VE GONE
EITHER DIRECTION,

35:34.660 --> 35:37.595
BUT I CHOSE
TO INDULGE THE CRAZIES.

35:37.630 --> 35:40.326
I LIKE TO DEFY STEREOTYPES
AT EVERY TURN.

35:40.370 --> 35:43.669
I NEVER JUMPED ON
THE FROZEN YOGURT TRAIN EITHER.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.634
- WHY DID YOU PICK ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

35:45.670 --> 35:46.739
- BECAUSE
YOU WERE PRETTY GOOD.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.169
YOU WERE INTERESTING.

35:48.210 --> 35:50.735
YOU HAD A BLACK SIDE-KICK,
AND THAT FELT FUN.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.247
- NO, IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.872
YOU'VE BEEN OBSESSED
WITH ME SINCE I WAS A KID.

35:53.910 --> 35:55.571
- NO, YANG.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.315
YANG WAS OBSESSED
WITH YOU, SHAWN.

35:57.350 --> 35:58.715
YANG.

35:58.750 --> 36:00.388
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHO THE HELL YOU WERE

36:00.420 --> 36:02.411
UNTIL YOU STARTED
DOING THIS SHTICK.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.849
YANG TOOK NOTICE OF
THE PRE-PUBESCENT YOU

36:04.890 --> 36:07.222
AND DEVELOPED
AN UNHEALTHY CRUSH.

36:07.260 --> 36:10.297
FEELINGS ARE THE ENEMY
OF EFFICIENCY, SHAWN.

36:10.330 --> 36:11.763
SHE BETRAYED ME
TO SAVE YOUR MOTHER,

36:11.800 --> 36:13.267
AND THAT TH REW
A SERIOUS WRENCH

36:13.300 --> 36:15.564
INTO THE COGS
OF MY CAREER PLANS.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.329
SHE BROKE MY TRUST

36:17.370 --> 36:19.406
AND SHE BROKE MY HEART,

36:19.440 --> 36:22.432
AND FOR THAT, I BLAME YOU.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.846
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO DIE.
SATISFIED?

36:34.860 --> 36:36.418
DID YOU READ MY BOOK?

36:36.460 --> 36:39.782
- NO, I DID NOT READ YOUR BOOK,
I WAS ANGRY WITH YOU.

36:39.830 --> 36:40.979
- [sigh]

36:41.030 --> 36:42.850
YOU GUYS REALLY
DROPPED THE BALL, HUH?

36:42.900 --> 36:44.891
- WE GOT PLAYED BY
THE NEW YOU.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.460
DADDY, I'M YOUR
OWN FLESH AND BLOOD,

36:51.510 --> 36:52.829
I JUST WANTED YOU TO BE
PROUD OF ME.

36:52.870 --> 36:55.668
- YOU BETRAYED ME.
YOU CHOSE HIM.

36:55.710 --> 36:58.577
- NO, NO, NO, I JUST WANTED US
TO BE LIKE A REAL FAMILY,

36:58.610 --> 37:00.976
LIKE THE SPENCERS.
- A REAL FAMILY?

37:01.010 --> 37:03.717
YOU'RE OBSESSED WITH
A FAIRY TALE, MY DEAR,

37:03.750 --> 37:05.240
I TAUGHT YOU BETTER.

37:05.290 --> 37:06.939
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT, DADDY.

37:06.990 --> 37:08.514
I'M SORRY.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.881
[sigh]
I WAS SADLY MISTAKEN.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.387

DON'T LISTEN TO HIM,
HE DOESN'T CONTROL YOU.

YOU CAN COME HOME.

YOU CAN COME HOME,
COME TO DADDY.

37:26.670 --> 37:29.537
COME TO DADDY.
COME GIVE DADDY A BIG HUG.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.893
- DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE!

37:50.930 --> 37:51.760
YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT?

37:51.800 --> 37:53.324
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

37:53.370 --> 37:55.361
- ALLISON'S CRAZY, THOUGH.
SHE'S IN ON THIS.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.334
- YEAH, I LEARNED THAT
THE HARD WAY.

37:57.370 --> 37:59.429
- I WAS DEAD WRONG,
I'M SO SORRY.

37:59.470 --> 38:00.698
OH, MY GOD,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

38:00.740 --> 38:01.877

YOU SHOULD SEE HER.

38:02.910 --> 38:05.902

AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

38:38.380 --> 38:40.598

38:45.920 --> 38:48.684
YOU NEVER ACTUALLY
KILLED ANYONE, DID YOU?

38:48.720 --> 38:50.984
- I COULD'VE STOPPED HIM.
I WAS WEAK.

38:51.020 --> 38:52.954
- HE RAISED YOU.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.389
YOU NEVER HAD A CHANCE.

38:54.430 --> 38:55.829
- COME ON.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.799
- LET'S GO.
- [clapping]

39:10.840 --> 39:12.876
GOOD-BYE, SHAWN,
GOOD-BYE, GUS.

39:12.910 --> 39:14.002
AND GOOD-BYE, JULIET.

39:14.050 --> 39:17.372
DON'T BE STRANGERS, WE
HAVE BADMINTON EVERY WEDNESDAY.

39:17.420 --> 39:19.479
- WELL, I HAVEN'T
PLAYED BADMINTON--

39:19.520 --> 39:20.782
- NO, SHAWN.

39:20.820 --> 39:22.913
- I'LL CATCH UP WITH
YOU LATER, MR. SPENCER.

39:26.990 --> 39:28.696
- GOOSE!

39:28.730 --> 39:31.722
- WE'RE OKAY.

39:46.450 --> 39:47.678
- MCNABB...
YOU STILL HERE?

39:47.710 --> 39:50.543
- THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS LEAVING
HERE TILL THIS THING WAS OVER.

39:50.580 --> 39:52.787
THIS HAS
BEEN A TRAUMATIC DAY.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.651
YEAR, ACTUALLY.

39:54.690 --> 39:56.089
JUST THINKING ABOUT
ALL OF THE...

39:56.120 --> 39:57.519
- JUSTICE?

39:57.560 --> 39:59.380
- I WAS GONNA SAY
NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES.

40:00.990 --> 40:04.027
YOU DON'T FEEL ANYTHING?

40:04.060 --> 40:05.721
- CLOSURE.

40:05.770 --> 40:06.998
INDIFFERENCE.

40:07.030 --> 40:07.997
HUNGER.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.588
- WOW.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.733
YOU'RE LIKE A ROBOT.
- THANK YOU.

40:11.770 --> 40:13.169
I GOT THE SAME COMMENT
ON MY EHARMONY PAGE

40:13.210 --> 40:14.677
SO IT MUST BE TRUE.

40:14.710 --> 40:16.598
ONE THING YOU LEARN
ABOUT ME RIGHT OFF THE BAT,

40:16.640 --> 40:17.937
TAKES A LOT MORE
THAN A DAY LIKE TODAY

40:17.980 --> 40:20.005
TO RUFFLE
THIS BIRD'S FEATHERS.

40:20.050 --> 40:22.871
GO HOME TO YOUR WIFE, MCNABB,
WE START AT 9:00 AM.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.980
- IT'S 7:00 RIGHT NOW.

40:26.020 --> 40:27.112
- FINE.

40:27.150 --> 40:28.879
COME IN AN HOUR LATE.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.934
- HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

40:42.970 --> 40:45.734
I FINISHED WRITING
MY STATEMENT 20 MINUTES AGO,

40:45.770 --> 40:49.501
GUS IS IN THE CAR, ENGINE ON,
WHEELS POINTED TOWARDS PANCAKES.

40:49.540 --> 40:51.076
PLEASE,
TELL ME YOU'RE IN.

40:51.110 --> 40:53.806
- I CAN'T WRITE THIS.

40:53.850 --> 40:56.978
I THOUGHT IF I JUST HAD
A MOMENT TO MYSELF I COULD.

40:57.020 --> 40:59.045
BUT IT'S JUST LIVING IT
ALL OVER AGAIN,

40:59.090 --> 41:00.978
AND...I CAN'T.

41:01.020 --> 41:04.729
- ALL RIGHT.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.523
THIS IS WHAT YOU WRITE.

41:06.560 --> 41:08.790
"WE DID IT."

41:08.830 --> 41:10.024
MAYBE YOU ADD
AN EXCLAMATION POINT

41:10.060 --> 41:11.698
IF THAT DOESN'T FEEL
TOO EXCESSIVE.

41:11.730 --> 41:14.938
- I COULD QUITE POSSIBLY
BE ELATED VERY SOON,

41:14.970 --> 41:19.202
BUT PART OF ME JUST FEELS LIKE
WE ARE JUST MARKING TIME

41:19.240 --> 41:21.777
TILL THE NEXT CRAZY
ROLLS IN.

41:21.810 --> 41:23.698
- OH, YEAH,
OF COURSE WE ARE.

41:23.740 --> 41:26.243
BUT THE NEXT CRAZY'S GONNA BE
SMALL POTATOES COMPARED TO YIN.

41:26.280 --> 41:29.249
PLUS...YOU HAVE ME NOW.

41:29.280 --> 41:30.838
I KNOW I MAY NOT APPEAR

41:30.880 --> 41:32.541
THAT PHYSICALLY IMPOSING
AT FIRST BLUSH,

41:32.590 --> 41:35.286
BUT IT TURNS OUT I HAVE
THE TENACITY OF A SWISS FOX,

41:35.320 --> 41:36.878
AND THE INSTINCTS
OF A DRAGONFLY.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.286
- YOU REALIZE
ONE OF THOSE IS A RABBIT

41:39.330 --> 41:41.025
AND THE OTHER IS AN INSECT?

41:41.060 --> 41:42.789
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY
I CHOSE THEM.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.739
BUT I'M
TRYING TO TELL YOU...

41:48.770 --> 41:49.930
THAT I WOULD PROTECT YOU.

41:49.970 --> 41:51.938
- AND I WOULD
PROTECT YOU RIGHT BACK.

41:51.970 --> 41:53.631
- I THINK YOU'RE SWELL.

42:00.010 --> 42:01.944
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

42:04.590 --> 42:05.943
I'LL BRING YOU SOME PANCAKES.

42:05.990 --> 42:07.810
I DON'T KNOW IF
THEY'RE GONNA TRAVEL.

42:07.850 --> 42:09.886
THEY MIGHT.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.923
I'LL GET ALL THE STUFF
ON THE SIDE.
