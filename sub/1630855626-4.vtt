WEBVTT

00:19.185 --> 00:20.562
[Poison Ivy]
It's like I'm going
to a business convention

00:20.645 --> 00:21.980
on the fucking moon.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.482
Avoid everyone
from Thanagar.
They all have chlamydia.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.109
Nora, it's
a business conference.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.445
It's not some
intergalactic orgy situation.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.739
Oh, so you'll be
the first person to come back

00:30.822 --> 00:33.450
from a business conference
without chlamydia?

00:33.533 --> 00:35.035
-Okay.
-I guess so.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.495
I mean, I'm...
I'm planning to dominate
this conference.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.123
Crushing panels,
mingling at drinks,

00:40.206 --> 00:42.500
making sick connections
with evil CEOs.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.003
Okay, well, when it starts
to sting when you pee,

00:45.128 --> 00:47.088
call Professor Hugo Strange.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.798
He's a walking pharmacy.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.175
Oh, what's this? Uh...

00:50.300 --> 00:53.928
[reading]

00:54.012 --> 00:55.472
[clicks tongue] Aw!

00:55.555 --> 00:57.265
[man on speaker]
This is the final boarding call

00:57.349 --> 00:59.225
for the MalCon Forum
on the moon!

00:59.351 --> 01:00.518
[brakes screech]

01:04.188 --> 01:05.774
Shit!

01:05.857 --> 01:07.650
That's like
the most expensive
dildo I've ever seen.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.695
[chuckles] I hope
the clouds don't have
a gag reflex.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.530
[laughing]

01:12.655 --> 01:14.407
[man on speaker]
For those of you
who think this is funny,

01:14.532 --> 01:16.868
there's a scientific reason
it has to be shaped like this.

01:16.993 --> 01:19.871
Uh, what's with
the pubes, dude?

01:19.954 --> 01:21.539
[man on speaker] Hey, there.
I can hear you.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.375
The antennas
have to be coarse and wiry

01:23.500 --> 01:25.710
and on the balls...
I mean orbs.

01:25.794 --> 01:29.047
So, let's get some quick pics
of me with the space dong.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.007
[man on speaker]
Have some respect.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.093
-You are
in a cathedral of science.
-[camera shutter clicking]

01:33.218 --> 01:34.301
[man on speaker]
Get on the fucking rocket,
so I can blastoff.

01:34.386 --> 01:35.845
[rocket rumbling]

01:42.644 --> 01:43.561
[Nora] Ho, ho!

01:43.687 --> 01:45.729
The sky is getting
pregnant tonight.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.775
[man on speaker]
A rocket gets sick
if it can't release its steam.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.860
[theme music playing]

01:53.446 --> 01:55.490
This is no way
to treat an old friend.

01:55.573 --> 01:58.576
I have to find a way
to fill my days, Mr. Mayor.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.370
I wanted to steal
a rocket ship,

02:00.453 --> 02:01.871
but they're all on the moon.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.666
I can't believe I didn't get
an invite to MalCon.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.918
Last year
I'm giving the keynote.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.795
This year, those fickle,
fair-weather one-percenters

02:09.878 --> 02:11.464
act like I don't even exist.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.633
They're right.
I'm only ransacking you
as a dry run

02:13.758 --> 02:15.427
for my governor's
mansion heist.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.845
Grab those giant scissors!

02:16.928 --> 02:19.639
Hey, I need those
for a car wash grand opening.

02:21.433 --> 02:24.811
-Let this sicko go, you sickos.
-[man grunting]

02:24.936 --> 02:26.771
Oh, it's Bat Harley.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.399
You've got two faces
like me now, huh?

02:29.482 --> 02:32.192
[groans] I like
the old one better.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.820
Oh! There's Ivy.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.905
Have a great time. Whoo!

02:35.989 --> 02:37.449
It was another rocket?

02:38.241 --> 02:40.035
You may have two faces,

02:40.118 --> 02:42.537
but I have two maces.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.457
[grunts] Wait!
Where are my maces?

02:45.540 --> 02:47.584
[groans] My shuriken,
they're missing.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.170
-Your what?
-They're throwing stars.
Doesn't matter, help!

02:50.295 --> 02:51.921
Uh, I know
I packed my gel bombs.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.256
Where's our stuff?

02:53.340 --> 02:55.508
Ha! Send them my way.
I'll handle it.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.259
[grunts]

02:56.343 --> 02:58.094
[man yelling]

02:58.178 --> 02:59.387
[men grunting]

03:01.139 --> 03:02.640
-[Two-Face groans]
-[Harley grunts]

03:02.766 --> 03:05.310
Ooh, you've got
that edge still.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.312
You must really miss
being evil, huh?

03:07.437 --> 03:11.107
Stop projecting your own shit
on me, Mr. Mayor.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.610
[eerie music playing]

03:14.611 --> 03:15.612
[Jon 1] Your calf pumps, sir.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.530
Lex Luthor is an abstraction.

03:17.655 --> 03:20.825
There is no real me...
for tax purposes.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.702
Everything about me
is artificial.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.329
My jawline, my shell companies,

03:25.413 --> 03:27.499
even all my lighting
on the moon.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.959
That's baby seal blood,
by the way.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.087
Very, very illegal on earth.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.672
Your body has me
literally reeling.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.882
Superman wishes
he had those cumgutters.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.466
Ready for your peel?

03:37.550 --> 03:38.760
-[ripping]
-Let's shed
that dead skin, mama.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.345
It's what snakes do
to stay smooth.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.222
-They do.
-It's true.

03:42.347 --> 03:47.435
Uh, yeah. Mr. Luthor?
Uh, sir, my question was,
who are these guys?

03:47.519 --> 03:49.020
-I'm Jon.
-I'm also Jon.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.563
-But there's no "h"
in my name.
-Or in mine.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.691
We're this chiseled
Greek god's PR team.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.526
What paper
do you work for again?

03:54.651 --> 03:56.986
-The Daily Planet.
-More like The Daily Superman.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.697
Well, good for you.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.699
Finally writing about something
other than that super-jacked,

04:00.824 --> 04:03.576
certainly undocumented
super-alien.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.829
Um, so I've been
on the moon for a week

04:05.912 --> 04:07.831
watching this conference
come together,

04:07.914 --> 04:10.208
and I still don't know
what you'll be announcing
at the keynote...

04:10.333 --> 04:13.420
Oh, well. Just forever changing

04:13.545 --> 04:16.548
the nexus of science
and industry. No spoilers.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.841
-[slurps]
-[whooshing]

04:18.925 --> 04:21.678
Exciting! That's so great.
I can't wait!

04:21.761 --> 04:24.514
Man. Wow.
Is this coffee extra strong?

04:24.597 --> 04:26.850
I... I just I am jazzed.
I am... Whoo!

04:26.933 --> 04:30.353
And one last question, uh,
about your mentee, Poison Ivy.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.106
Pass. This is an interview
about Lex Luthor,
not his protege.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.692
I am happy to talk about Ivy.

04:35.775 --> 04:39.821
It takes a lot of courage
to install someone like her
as a CEO.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.197
Not only is she a woman,

04:41.281 --> 04:42.866
but a green woman.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.161
Only a true forward thinker
could come up with that.

04:46.244 --> 04:50.582
Someone so strong
that he can crack
a walnut with his armpit.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.417
-You care to see?
-Don't print any of that.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.503
-[dramatic music playing]
-[Nightwing panting]

04:55.587 --> 04:57.088
And what happened to our gear?

04:57.213 --> 04:58.673
We looked
like amateurs out there.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.550
I thought I looked pretty good.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.094
Ugh. Someone must have
sabotaged us.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.055
Uh, why is Mommy here?

05:07.223 --> 05:08.141
[camera feed warbles]

05:08.266 --> 05:10.643
Your mommy took our camera.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.646
Unhand our stuff!

05:14.481 --> 05:16.107
[Nightwing groans]

05:16.232 --> 05:17.609
This has never been your stuff.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.319
It's property
of Wayne Enterprises,

05:19.402 --> 05:20.779
which is teetering
on a financial cliff.

05:20.904 --> 05:22.781
So I'm liquidating
all nonessential assets.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.408
We need our weapons
to protect Gotham.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.702
For far too long,
you coddled bat-babies

05:27.786 --> 05:29.287
have relied
on trivial gadgetry,

05:29.371 --> 05:31.790
while you've let
your ultimate weapons
grow soft.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.626
-Your bodies.
-Nuh-uh. I have
a rock hard six pack.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.252
-[smacks]
-[groans] Mom.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.879
Effective immediately,

05:37.962 --> 05:40.924
you are no longer
being financed
by Wayne Enterprises

05:41.007 --> 05:43.677
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to the moon.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.303
Oh, and here.
Happy Birthday, son.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.430
My birthday was
five months ago.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.640
Is this a rattle?

05:48.723 --> 05:49.557
[explosion rumbles]

05:49.641 --> 05:51.226
[tires screeching]

05:51.308 --> 05:52.727
[rocket whooshing]

05:54.104 --> 05:57.357
Feels like she could've
liquidated that.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.067
[woman on speaker]
Welcome to MalCon

05:59.150 --> 06:03.488
License plate, GR8-VLN,
please move your rocket.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.865
It's about to be towed.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.702
Oh, wow. Thank you.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.995
I don't usually wear jewelry,
but I will make an excep--

06:11.079 --> 06:13.498
It's a lanyard
for the conference.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.041
[gasps] Look.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.002
Steppenwolf
hasn't picked his up yet.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.671
-Classic move.
-Mmm, intergalactic dom shit.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.631
-Love him.
-Steppenwolf?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.217
-He's a warlord, right?
-Oh, Ivy.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.928
Sure he captains
a ruthless canine army
on Apokolips,

06:27.012 --> 06:28.847
but his true passion
is venture capitalism.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.766
You probably think
Tony Soprano is just a mobster?

06:31.850 --> 06:35.478
No. He made his real fortune
from owning the Bada Bing!

06:35.562 --> 06:39.899
I mean, I actually see him
more as like a victim
of Livia's toxic maternity.

06:40.025 --> 06:43.028
-So are we meeting
with Steppenwolf?
-[laughing]

06:43.111 --> 06:46.031
You don't get face time
with Steppenwolf
at your first conference.

06:46.156 --> 06:49.284
He only makes time
for the real innovators.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.244
You can golf
as drunk as you want

06:51.369 --> 06:53.121
-and let lightning do the work.
-[grunting]

06:53.204 --> 06:54.748
Perfect swing every time.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.499
Did you hear about
this thing in Gotham

06:56.582 --> 06:59.419
where someone replaced all the
male trees with female ones.

06:59.544 --> 07:03.256
-Yeah, that was me.
-You see, male trees
cause allergies,

07:03.381 --> 07:04.883
because, unlike female trees,

07:04.966 --> 07:06.509
they don't have fruit
to contain the toxins

07:06.593 --> 07:08.011
created during photosynthesis.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.096
-Right. That's why I--
-I'll send you an article.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.057
-Done and done.
-[notification dings]

07:12.140 --> 07:14.976
Oh, man. So I...
I'm just seeing that
I'm not on any panels.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.811
I just was excited
to impress everyone

07:16.895 --> 07:20.065
-with my cool answers
to questions.
-[laughing]

07:20.190 --> 07:23.693
You're doing something
way more important
than panels.

07:23.777 --> 07:28.114
Oh, there I am.
"45 second intro
to Lex Luthor..."

07:28.239 --> 07:32.327
-Wait. What?
-That 45 seconds is the hottest
time slot of the weekend.

07:32.409 --> 07:33.828
You have to save your voice.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.498
I'll have one
of the Jons get you some tea.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.585
-[Poison Ivy growls]
-[slurps]

07:40.669 --> 07:41.711
[Robin] Is this all we have?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.380
[computer warbling]

07:43.463 --> 07:47.884
-[Robin] Mmm.
-Ha! My life savings
for the fam.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.136
Nineteen bucks.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.722
That won't even cover
the electricity
for my air fryer.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.599
Okay, we have $19,

07:54.724 --> 07:57.394
and, ugh, a silver baby rattle.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.561
We're screwed.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.021
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

08:00.105 --> 08:02.107
No, I'm gonna have
to go to school.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.274
Where will I sit at lunch?

08:03.358 --> 08:05.235
No one's going to school.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.405
We just need
to figure out a way
to generate some income.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.739
I can sell locks of my hair.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.032
Oh, wait, better idea.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.410
Nightwing, that ass,
live cam, baby.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.579
Hey, my glutes
are not for sale.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.540
Ugh, selfish prick. I'll do it.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.291
Okay? I used
to rent out my feet

08:20.417 --> 08:22.460
to rich women who needed
their shoes broken in.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.045
I bet my profile
is still active.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.171
Okay, so not that,

08:25.296 --> 08:28.466
but renting
does give me an idea.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.051
[doorbell rings]

08:30.135 --> 08:32.053
[with Swedish accent] Hello!
This is CleggBnb?

08:32.136 --> 08:35.557
Yes. Welcome.
You must be Amelie and Jonas.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.308
-"Yonas."
-Yonas.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.893
Yonas.

08:38.977 --> 08:39.811
Yonas.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.270
-Yo--
-Please, please come in.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.565
Uh, you'll find everything
you need in here.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.650
The Wi-Fi password,
the history of the house

08:45.734 --> 08:47.944
and, of course,
restaurant recommendations.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.154
Hey, why don't
you two lovebirds

08:49.279 --> 08:50.697
go get settled
in your room, huh?

08:50.822 --> 08:52.449
Hey, Amelie.
Look, at the door knobble.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.325
-So beautskiful.
-Don't go in there.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.036
-Okay?
-Or there.

08:56.161 --> 08:56.828
Or there.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.497
Okay, meanie man. Okay.

08:59.581 --> 09:00.999
Hey, this is too risky.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.792
What if they find out
who we actually are?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.252
It's all gonna be worth it.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.838
Between renting out
the place, couponing--

09:06.921 --> 09:08.631
I'm getting so many paper cuts.

09:08.715 --> 09:09.758
I hate being a poor.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.176
We have to buy back our gear.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.136
Or we use the money
to keep the lights on

09:13.219 --> 09:15.013
and I teach you to fight
without your gear.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.182
I think Talia
might be right
about you guys.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.768
You're kind of useless
soggy nut sacks
without your little gadgets.

09:19.851 --> 09:22.437
How dare you--
[grunts] Harley!

09:22.520 --> 09:24.689
Okay, show us what you've got.

09:24.814 --> 09:25.982
[glass squeaking]

09:26.066 --> 09:28.651
It started
in a single toilet bowl

09:28.735 --> 09:31.696
with a crust
of a bologna sandwich.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.324
And now White Collar Wine,

09:34.407 --> 09:38.912
is the official beverage
of MalCon. [laughing]

09:39.037 --> 09:41.790
-[all applauding]
-Let's start with the Chablis.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.833
The nose of green jello

09:43.917 --> 09:46.711
pairs well with an aged gruyere

09:46.836 --> 09:51.174
-and tax evasion.
-[slurps] Ooh, Penal Noir.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.550
Wow, what's this feeling?

09:52.676 --> 09:55.887
It's like my head is spinning
and my tummy is a-rumbly.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.139
But I also feel happy.

09:58.223 --> 10:01.559
None for you.
Alcohol dries out
the vocal cords.

10:01.643 --> 10:02.894
[Poison Ivy grumbles]

10:03.019 --> 10:04.396
There's someone I'd like
to introduce you to.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.563
She's a woman like you.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.149
-Meet--
-Hey! Love the tote.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.110
-Right?
-You know each other.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.195
God, you've been
on the moon too long.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.240
We already met
at the Evil Women
in Business Luncheon.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.241
Women's luncheon?

10:16.324 --> 10:17.325
Lex, can we steal you?

10:17.409 --> 10:19.244
There's an important task

10:19.327 --> 10:20.870
-that only a very swole alpha
can attend to.
-[Poison Ivy laughs]

10:20.954 --> 10:22.372
I'm sure
your schedule is packed,

10:22.455 --> 10:24.457
but I'd love
to find time for us to get

10:24.582 --> 10:25.917
a couple's massage.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.169
These lanyards are
killing my neck and my vibe.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.839
Actually, I wasn't placed
on any panels.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.967
So, if you're free anytime,
except 45 seconds

10:34.092 --> 10:36.511
before Lex's keynote
then, you know...

10:36.594 --> 10:37.595
Fucking Lex.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.222
You're the hot new blood here.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.182
Don't let that Ken doll
wannabe hold you back.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.101
-So he is fucking with me.
-[portal trilling]

10:45.937 --> 10:47.230
[woman gasps]

10:47.313 --> 10:50.233
[growling]

10:50.316 --> 10:52.485
-[people howling]
-Ah! Steppenwolf's here.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.778
Such an attention whore!

10:53.862 --> 10:55.739
-God love him.
-Gross.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.949
[Lex] Steppenwolf,
remember last year?

10:58.074 --> 10:59.951
Wolf Pack. [growls]

11:00.035 --> 11:01.453
-[man screaming]
-[wolf growls]

11:01.536 --> 11:02.954
-Sit!
-[wolf whimpers]

11:05.123 --> 11:07.208
-Repulsive.
-[scoffs] You know what?

11:07.292 --> 11:08.418
[wolf grumbling]

11:08.501 --> 11:10.628
I'm gonna get that face time
with Steppenwolf.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.130
[upbeat rock music playing]

11:13.757 --> 11:15.342
-[Elon Musk grunts]
-Uh... [chuckles]

11:15.467 --> 11:18.970
So, hello. I would like
to field that question.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.263
[Elon Musk grunts]

11:23.808 --> 11:24.934
[electricity crackling]

11:28.605 --> 11:32.150
Hey, Zuckerberg, have fun
in the metaverse, dweeb.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.111
[Zuckerberg screaming]

11:36.363 --> 11:37.238
[screaming continues]

11:37.822 --> 11:39.366
[laughing]

11:53.338 --> 11:54.923
I just wanna say
I'm really flattered

11:55.006 --> 11:56.508
that you wanted
to get java with me.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.093
You're the woman of the hour.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.387
I have unlimited resources.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.681
You have unlimited ideas.

12:02.806 --> 12:03.890
Let's collab...

12:04.015 --> 12:07.936
[coughs] Excuse me... orate.

12:09.854 --> 12:10.939
[Barbara grunting]

12:12.273 --> 12:13.942
-[Barbara yells]
-And...

12:14.025 --> 12:15.193
You're both dead.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.861
Come on.
You can do better than that.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.196
What the heck?

12:18.321 --> 12:19.864
That was
dangerously close
to my nipples.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.908
-[grunts]
-Toughen up.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.452
You think real villains
are above giving you
a titty twister?

12:24.536 --> 12:26.496
-Think again!
-[Dick Grayson groans]

12:26.579 --> 12:28.415
I want my Bat stun gun.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.542
If you want a weapon,
look around.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.419
Everything's a weapon.

12:32.544 --> 12:33.878
Fine. What about my belt

12:33.962 --> 12:36.006
that Amelie poked
four extra holes in?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.550
Horrible choice for fashion.
Great choice for weapon.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.093
-[grunts]
-[Dick] What about
cheeseballs?

12:40.218 --> 12:41.678
They were several
on the floor this morning.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.971
I nearly broke my neck.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.348
Those Euroscum are
trying to kill me!

12:45.432 --> 12:47.851
Okay, paranoid, I'm sure
it's just a Swedish tradition.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.185
Be respectful.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.022
Hello. Do you recommend
any Thai food?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.523
It's in the binder, Jonas!

12:53.606 --> 12:56.067
"Yonas." Thanks, ya.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.402
Okay, why are they cooking?

12:57.527 --> 12:59.279
They just asked
for Thai food recs.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.281
[Amelie muffled] How do I use
the dishwashy?

13:01.406 --> 13:02.782
-Ugh! [grunts]
-[phone vibrates]

13:02.907 --> 13:04.325
Ooh, ooh.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.077
Guess who's girlfriend's
making headlines on the moon?

13:06.202 --> 13:07.746
Mine, probably. She's a dime.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.790
"Move Over Sun:
Poison Ivy Makes
the Moon Shine Bright.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.917
"Ten things Poison Ivy
can't live without
on the moon."

13:13.001 --> 13:16.087
[gasps] I gotta call Ivy
for the deets.

13:16.171 --> 13:18.089
Ivy! Ivy, Ivy! I have some

13:18.214 --> 13:19.758
-really exciting IP...
-[cell phone vibrating]

13:19.841 --> 13:21.051
...that would be perfect
for you...

13:21.134 --> 13:22.510
Hey, baby. What's up?

13:22.594 --> 13:25.597
Um, G-friend,
you are killing it on the moon,

13:25.722 --> 13:27.265
according to my feeds.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.767
It's crazy. I went
to the bathroom,

13:28.892 --> 13:30.769
and someone tried
to reach into the stall

13:30.852 --> 13:32.312
and tried to take my underwear.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.272
Ooh, ooh.
Okay, would it be cool

13:34.397 --> 13:36.024
if I sold some of your undies
online on the dark Clegg?

13:36.107 --> 13:37.525
We're down
to canned beans over here,

13:37.609 --> 13:39.444
and you know
how sodium affects my skin.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.071
Um, sure.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.572
I mean, you got to give
the market what it wants,

13:42.655 --> 13:44.699
and obviously I'm gonna
refute it publicly.

13:44.783 --> 13:48.286
But I kind of like
that the people, like,
want my underwear.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.038
That's what's up, Miss Thang!

13:50.121 --> 13:52.040
I am so glad
you're enjoying yourself.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.458
Maybe it's
the toilet wine talking,

13:53.540 --> 13:55.960
but I've been having
so many ideas

13:56.044 --> 13:57.754
and everyone, like,
thinks they're brilliant.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.006
Of course they are brilliant.
God, you are so fucking hot.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.466
I want it right now.
What are you wearing?

14:01.549 --> 14:03.343
[clears throat]
I'm wearing, like, a lanyard

14:03.468 --> 14:05.512
with a bunch of maps
and QR codes. [coughs]

14:05.637 --> 14:07.389
Yes! Well, call me
when you're in the bathtub.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.933
I wanna hear more
about this fucking lanyard.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.726
[sexy music playing]

14:11.810 --> 14:13.853
[both moaning]

14:13.978 --> 14:15.355
[moaning continues]

14:15.480 --> 14:17.440
-[woman moaning]
-[man grunting]

14:17.524 --> 14:19.818
The physical act
of sex is so pedestrian.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.821
Surrogates are
much more efficient
and less to clean up.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.073
-[intercom clicks]
-Flip him over
and play with his ass.

14:26.449 --> 14:27.659
[vibrating]

14:27.742 --> 14:29.828
So what do you think
of the convention this year?

14:29.953 --> 14:31.830
Every detail is my own design.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.248
Including the sweatshirts.

14:33.331 --> 14:34.915
Did you notice the thumbhole?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.335
Smart move
putting Ivy front and center.

14:37.419 --> 14:38.503
She's a star.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.255
Every panel
she's been on has been packed.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.590
What?
Ivy's not on any panels.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.759
She's saving her voice
for my keynote.

14:44.843 --> 14:48.221
Or maybe next year
you'll be introducing
her keynote.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.223
You should have been
keeping an eye on her.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.892
[sighs] I know
what you're doing.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.644
This is a sex thing.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.479
You get off on weak men.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.522
[Talia giggles]

14:57.647 --> 14:59.190
[sighs] What happened
to the cape?

14:59.274 --> 15:01.192
-Gives me a wedgie.
-I said,

15:01.276 --> 15:04.279
the cape stays on
until you finish.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.698
You know what?
I'm not in the mood anymore.

15:06.781 --> 15:07.866
Forget it.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.159
[Talia sighs]

15:09.242 --> 15:10.201
That was great.

15:10.285 --> 15:13.329
[moaning continues]

15:13.413 --> 15:15.206
[Joker chuckles
and grumbles]

15:15.290 --> 15:18.335
[Joker] Ha! Huh! [laughs]

15:18.418 --> 15:21.880
Lex is so fucking thirsty.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.215
Uh, are you even listening?

15:24.299 --> 15:26.426
Oh, did my briefly
glancing at my phone

15:26.551 --> 15:28.386
imply this was
the most boring meeting

15:28.511 --> 15:30.722
about cutting grass
I've ever been to?

15:30.805 --> 15:32.724
Because I'm riveted.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.810
Please continue.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.354
Okay.

15:37.437 --> 15:41.399
I was saying
normally we use a 6 mm blade,

15:41.524 --> 15:44.527
but due to the lack of rain,
it's all basically kindling.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.030
So, we're gonna
have to run out and buy...

15:47.113 --> 15:48.531
[continues indistinctly]

15:49.741 --> 15:52.077
[Dick humming]

15:55.121 --> 15:57.457
[continues humming]

15:57.582 --> 15:59.626
Oh, where's that
draft coming from?

16:01.336 --> 16:03.797
[grunts] That's it!

16:03.922 --> 16:06.675
It's time to pack your bags,
you Euro pervs.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.097
I told you we couldn't
trust Amelie and Yonas.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.848
[Jonas] Beautskiful
pronunciation.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.100
[Dick groans]

16:16.393 --> 16:17.644
[emcee] And again,
the hotline is open

16:17.769 --> 16:20.105
for any tips
on the Zuck's whereabouts.

16:20.230 --> 16:23.733
-Let's get
#wheresMark trending!
-[audience applauding]

16:25.276 --> 16:26.820
-[pumping]
-Uh, what's that sound?

16:26.945 --> 16:28.279
I'm pumping my calves.

16:28.363 --> 16:29.781
Yeah, but you're wearing...
[clears throat]

16:29.864 --> 16:31.866
You're wearing... [grunts]
You're wearing pants.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.244
You think you can hide
chicken calves behind pants?

16:34.327 --> 16:35.620
Ugh, women don't understand

16:35.704 --> 16:37.539
the pressures
put on men's bodies.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.665
-[Poison Ivy clears throat]
-What is going on
with your voice?

16:39.790 --> 16:44.087
And now your keynote speaker,
Mr. Lex Luthor,

16:44.170 --> 16:47.465
with an introduction
by the incredible,
the incomparable,

16:47.549 --> 16:50.010
-the absolutely insidious...
-Oh!

16:50.135 --> 16:52.387
[emcee] Poison Ivy!

16:52.470 --> 16:53.972
[audience cheering
and applauding]

16:54.055 --> 16:55.974
You have been speaking
on panels.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.600
Why'd I think
I could rely on you?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.644
Did you even do
the throat douche
the Jons gave you?

16:59.728 --> 17:02.647
Don't respond. You'll just
strain your voice more.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.441
I mean, Lex,
you really thought that

17:04.523 --> 17:06.067
I'd spend all my time
on the moon,

17:06.151 --> 17:07.527
like, douching my throat...

17:07.652 --> 17:10.696
[coughs] waiting
to talk about you?

17:10.821 --> 17:12.824
So yeah, I did panels.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.910
Okay, I did all the panels.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.954
-[coughing]
-Never send a woman
to do a man's job.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.832
Good evening, evil colleagues.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.960
What an amazing time
to be a woman in villainy.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.420
I'm humbled

17:25.502 --> 17:29.257
to be the LOD's
first CEO
with a labia...

17:29.341 --> 17:31.551
Just keep scrolling. Get to me.

17:31.676 --> 17:35.180
It's an honor for you
to watch me announce
my new initiative

17:35.263 --> 17:37.182
using the latest
LexCorp technology,

17:37.265 --> 17:38.558
developed right here
on the moon.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.894
I devised a plan
to thicken the ozone layer,

17:41.019 --> 17:43.980
reverse global warming,
and save the earth.

17:44.064 --> 17:48.526
The Earth Saver by Lex
can beam new ozone particles

17:48.610 --> 17:50.570
into the atmosphere
literally whenever.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.989
And, if I keep saving
the earth,

17:53.073 --> 17:56.201
-we can keep destroying it.
-[audience cheering]

17:58.828 --> 18:00.955
I'll now open it up
for questions.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.540
Sounds like
socially conscious evil.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.376
Did Lex steal your idea, Ivy?

18:04.501 --> 18:05.669
This has nothing
to do with her.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.379
Ivy, you said
in an earlier panel,

18:07.462 --> 18:09.047
I'm quoting, "I love bread."
Can you expound on that?

18:09.130 --> 18:10.382
[reporter] Poison Ivy,
over here!

18:10.507 --> 18:11.633
How do you come up
with all your cool plans?

18:11.716 --> 18:13.259
And also,
how is your hair so shiny?

18:13.385 --> 18:15.095
Would you have been mean
to me in middle school?

18:15.220 --> 18:16.763
It's fine if the answer is yes.

18:16.888 --> 18:17.931
[pumping]

18:18.056 --> 18:19.724
Ivy, I'd love you
for our cover.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.351
C... Could you pose
for the camera?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.228
-That's my cover.
-[camera shutters clicking]

18:23.311 --> 18:24.437
[female reporter] Is it true
you're collaborating
with Steppenwolf?

18:24.562 --> 18:25.605
-[bursts]
-[Lex yells]

18:25.730 --> 18:27.941
-[all gasping]
-[Lex grunts]

18:28.066 --> 18:29.651
You're working
with Steppenwolf?

18:29.734 --> 18:31.736
Oh, you know what?
Honestly, it's casual.

18:31.861 --> 18:35.073
He did offer to bankroll
whatever I want to do next.

18:35.156 --> 18:39.411
I'd go into more detail,
but, you know,
I'm saving my voice.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.246
[yells] That's enough.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.248
-Everybody get off my moon.
-[alarm blaring]

18:45.083 --> 18:46.584
[alien screaming]

18:46.710 --> 18:47.627
[all screaming]

18:51.756 --> 18:53.258
[Amelie grunting]

18:54.426 --> 18:55.969
I thought
they'd have more stuff.

18:56.094 --> 18:59.222
-[grunts]
-Some people must have
already take everything.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.765
Honeys, I'm home!

19:00.849 --> 19:03.768
I made bank
on the first batch
of Ivy's thongs.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.021
They're robbing us?

19:06.104 --> 19:08.732
God damn it!
Time to take out
the Euro trash.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.275
-[upbeat music playing]
-[Jonas grunts]

19:10.358 --> 19:12.861
[screams] Oh, God.
You sneaky motherfucker.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.863
[both grunting]

19:14.946 --> 19:16.156
[sniffs and sighs]

19:16.281 --> 19:17.907
[grunts]

19:21.119 --> 19:23.079
How are you still standing?

19:23.163 --> 19:24.873
It's the drugs.

19:24.956 --> 19:28.084
They've permanent
turned off the pain
receptors in my brains.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.878
[Harley groans]

19:31.921 --> 19:32.756
[screams]

19:32.839 --> 19:34.632
[rockets whooshing]

19:34.716 --> 19:36.509
[automated voice]
Oxygen levels are
at ten percent.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.470
-Please evacuate immediately.
-[people screaming]

19:38.595 --> 19:40.847
Please note that
the number of escape pods

19:40.972 --> 19:43.767
is lower than the number
of convention attendees.

19:43.850 --> 19:47.062
Thank you for attending
this year's MalCon.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.897
Brought to you by LexCorp.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.360
Fear not,
evil business leaders.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.820
I'll save you. Oh, corn nuts.

19:55.945 --> 19:59.282
Luthor's lined this place
with trace amounts
of Kryptonite.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.658
That explains a lot, actually.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.577
-[wolf growling]
-[Steppenwolf] Want a ride?

20:02.660 --> 20:05.330
I have to stop on Earth
to pick up my lover, Scruffy.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.082
Scruffy Adelstein,

20:07.165 --> 20:10.460
my Moroccan,
fashion model boyfriend,
and notorious good boy.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.836
You know what?
I got a date with a blonde

20:11.961 --> 20:13.088
in a chastity belt,

20:13.171 --> 20:16.841
but I could stop
by Casablanca first.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.176
[portal trilling]

20:18.259 --> 20:19.552
Effortlessly draining
that bottle, sir.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.137
[Jon 2] Three cheers
for our chaotic king!

20:21.221 --> 20:23.682
Nice. And they say women are
too emotional. [scoffs]

20:23.807 --> 20:25.684
-[bottle shatters]
-[Lex grunts] Shit!

20:27.018 --> 20:28.687
[Harley grunting]

20:28.770 --> 20:31.981
Damn you
and your drug-enhanced
ability to take hits.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.983
Ha! Eat chastity belt!

20:34.067 --> 20:37.696
Saved by my everlasting
devotion to my lunar lover!

20:37.779 --> 20:39.989
-[Amelie grunts]
-[Harley groans]

20:40.073 --> 20:42.992
[grunts] Hey, how about
I give you a free night? Eh?

20:43.076 --> 20:44.411
Or a partial refund!

20:44.536 --> 20:46.621
-[belt lashes]
-[Amelie yells and groans]

20:48.456 --> 20:50.959
[heroic music playing]

20:51.042 --> 20:52.752
Get ready to check out, pal.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.964
What? But the binder says
checkout is noon.

20:56.965 --> 21:00.510
[all grunting]

21:04.055 --> 21:05.348
[Jonas groans]

21:06.057 --> 21:07.684
Aw, look at us.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.228
We're the Bat-Bat family now.

21:10.311 --> 21:13.565
Oh, God, I just love bonding.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.567
[Jonas groans]

21:15.692 --> 21:17.027
[gasps] Oh, hey. Guess what?

21:17.110 --> 21:19.404
I was able to sell enough
of Ivy's squirrel covers

21:19.487 --> 21:21.448
that we can get
new security cameras, right?

21:21.573 --> 21:22.866
So no one can steal from us,

21:22.949 --> 21:24.743
or cut the butts
out of our towels ever again.

21:24.868 --> 21:26.828
Although,
it's a good look for you,

21:26.911 --> 21:29.914
like twin,
honey ham, glory holes.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.124
Mmm.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.584
[intense music playing]

21:34.669 --> 21:36.087
[engine turning over]

21:38.965 --> 21:40.050
[groundskeeper grunting]

21:43.511 --> 21:47.682
[Joker cackling]

21:52.187 --> 21:53.480
[crickets chirping]

21:53.605 --> 21:55.231
[keyboard clacking]

21:55.315 --> 21:57.275
[Damian] Ah! These paper cuts.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.277
My dumb,
bandage-fingers don't work.

21:59.402 --> 22:00.945
-I'm going to bed.
-Same.

22:01.071 --> 22:05.033
I have a headache
from Jonas's
gas station body spray,

22:05.116 --> 22:06.451
[door creaking]

22:19.297 --> 22:20.548
