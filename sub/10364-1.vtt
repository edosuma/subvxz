to have some money to give us?

Uh, no.

With my sincerest gratitude,
this New Year's Eve,

03:58.120 --> 04:01.040
I wish to share some reflections
I have made so far in life,

04:01.120 --> 04:04.680
related to us as individuals,
and as a nation.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.240
Yeah.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.640
[Torgeir in English]  Hi. I'm just calling
to say thank you for the old year.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.080
Hey, happy New Year to you, too.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.440
How's your brother holding up?
Is he ready for his big day?

04:22.520 --> 04:23.520
Yeah, he's, uh...

04:23.600 --> 04:24.600
[in Norwegian] ...getting there.

04:24.680 --> 04:28.600
Guess what?
We almost got mugged last night.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.680
Uh-huh.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.240
We were out walking
when suddenly two guys came along

04:32.320 --> 04:35.040
and one of them pulled a gun on us.

04:35.120 --> 04:40.000
I was sure that it was all over.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.440
For me, at least.

04:42.520 --> 04:47.680
But then Oscarito,
Roar's future brother-in-law, comes up.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.520

and says,  "Habla, habla, habla" --

- [in Norwegian] Don't answer it.

about my brother.

What did you just say?

09:33.560 --> 09:37.640
But when? How? Who did this?

09:48.880 --> 09:50.280
I'm leaving.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.480
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.960
Right before your brother's wedding?

09:55.040 --> 09:56.320
Nice.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.960
Johnny has been shot.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.880
He needs me. He could die.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.280
I understand that.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.640
But maybe someone else
needs a certain someone

10:07.720 --> 10:10.440
on an important day in his life.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.400
How would you feel if you got shot?

Can you do my back with this cream?

12:16.280 --> 12:20.960
The thing is,
I was driving down the highway.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.040
And the road was really slippery.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.160

that Mesna Chess Club

13:45.000 --> 13:47.880
had ordered a cheerleader striptease.

Except for the food.

- [Sigrid] Oh, yeah.
- [Johnny] You didn't bring me lasagna?

- [doctor] Yes?
- The gun victim.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.720
Yes?

15:11.800 --> 15:15.480
Henriksen is
a celebrated nightclub entrepreneur.

15:15.560 --> 15:21.800
It isn't appropriate for him
to be in a ward full of vegetables.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.320
Vegetables?

Yes, but--

15:33.440 --> 15:37.200
Then he has no reason to complain.

There's nothing more I can do.

15:39.720 --> 15:40.720
Okay?

I can tell that you're stressed.
A busy lady.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.400
In which case,
there could be nothing better...

15:53.720 --> 15:55.760

15:57.520 --> 15:59.880
I scratch your back, you scratch mine.

16:02.520 --> 16:06.200
Are you trying to bribe me
with carcinogenic contraband?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.000
Correct.

Tell Mr. Negotiator to put

[Torgeir in Norwegian] How sure are we
these are the guys that shot Johnny?

16:37.480 --> 16:42.760
They were at the diner
on New Year's Eve, and they spoke Baltic.

16:42.840 --> 16:46.800
- And their clothes were bloodied.
- I'll bet that was Johnny's blood!

16:46.880 --> 16:48.600
- [Roy] Yes.
- It has to be his blood.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.080
- [Roy] Exactly. Okay.
- Let's get those bastards!

16:51.160 --> 16:55.280
- Come on, boys! Let's rock and roll.
- Yeah! Come on!

16:55.360 --> 16:56.400
We'll show them...

16:57.400 --> 16:58.640
...blood!

17:04.200 --> 17:07.880
[speaking Polish] Come on, faster.
They need that meat.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.240
[in Norwegian] Christ,
what kind of sick operation is this?

17:13.320 --> 17:14.880
[in Polish] Come on.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.400
[in Norwegian]
This is just like  Dexter .

17:16.480 --> 17:19.880
[electric saw buzzing]

17:23.520 --> 17:25.360
[Roy] Okay, guys.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.440
Come on!

17:27.600 --> 17:28.920
For Johnny!

17:29.920 --> 17:31.440
Come on, guys!

17:38.720 --> 17:41.440
[man in Polish]
We must get moving.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.520
Hurry up.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.920
[Torgeir in English] Okay, everybody.
Don't fucking move!

18:04.000 --> 18:06.560
[Roy] Where is the one-armed lady?

18:06.640 --> 18:07.920
[Torgeir] Where?

18:19.560 --> 18:21.600
[Roy in Norwegian]
Salami? Huh?

18:23.160 --> 18:24.240
What the fuck?

18:25.240 --> 18:27.440
What the hell's going on here?

18:27.520 --> 18:30.560
Uh... [stammering]

18:33.200 --> 18:35.200
We're from the Food Safety Authority.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.200
My Poles are legal.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.760
[Torgeir] Yes.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.880
Everything looks okay here.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.560
Let's move on, guys.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.280
Have a nice day.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.680
[man singing Norwegian ballad over radio]

19:13.040 --> 19:15.360
Mind if I, uh, turn off the light?

19:23.280 --> 19:24.480
[Johnny sighs]

19:25.800 --> 19:27.840
[man] I saw the tiger, too.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.240
Come again?

19:33.040 --> 19:35.720
I saw the tiger, too.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.280
I sure hope this is a dream.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.680
It's all a dream, Silvio.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.120
It's all a dream.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.840
Ladies.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.120
[chuckles]

20:10.200 --> 20:12.080
[boy muttering]

20:17.720 --> 20:21.960
CHILDREN'S PSYCHIATRIC UNIT

20:37.240 --> 20:38.800
AUTISTIC - NON-COMMUNICATIVE
TRAUMATIZED AFTER SHOOTING

20:38.880 --> 20:40.600
That's who you are.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.080
Hiya, tiger. Remember me?

20:48.960 --> 20:51.320
I want to thank you
for looking after me out there.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.680
The strong silent type, eh?

20:58.200 --> 20:59.440
That's all right.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.560
You saw me get shot, you remember that?

21:04.600 --> 21:06.080
Well, look at me now.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.840
Good as new.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.320
[Magnus] "Look,
I know you're a smart lawyer.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.400
Don't get smart with me."

21:14.480 --> 21:16.160
What's that you say?

21:19.040 --> 21:22.200
Oh! Why don't you sit down,
Johnny, have a cookie?

21:22.280 --> 21:24.080
All right, don't mind if I do.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.000
[chuckles]

21:27.080 --> 21:28.080
[Magnus whines]

21:28.160 --> 21:31.200
What? All right.
All right. Those are yours.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.800
Uh... This one's all right?

21:34.880 --> 21:35.880
[Magnus] Mmm.

21:38.200 --> 21:41.200
"Laury Martin?
That little fresh kid with the pigtails?"

21:43.000 --> 21:45.040
Are you speaking my language there, tiger?

21:46.040 --> 21:48.480
"Morning, gentlemen.
Nice day for a murder.

21:48.560 --> 21:52.440
Where's Frazier? Where's the hundred
grand? You think we're gonna pay off?"

21:53.480 --> 21:57.360
That's  Angels with Dirty Faces ,
my favorite Jimmy Cagney movie.

21:58.800 --> 22:03.440
Now, try this on for size:
"Waddaya hear, waddaya say?"

22:05.240 --> 22:09.240
"Waddaya hear, waddaya say?
I'm glad to see you, Rocky."

22:09.320 --> 22:14.520
"Oh, and I'm glad to see you too, kiddo.
I'm glad to see you."

22:14.600 --> 22:16.600
[chuckles]

22:28.200 --> 22:31.840
[in Norwegian] How did you do that?
He never speaks to strangers.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.480
[in English] Turns out,
we have very similar taste in movies.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.000
Movies?

22:36.080 --> 22:37.560
[Johnny] Mm-hmm.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.720
All that mumbling...

22:38.800 --> 22:39.800
Yeah, yeah...

22:39.880 --> 22:42.000
Old gangster movies.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.120
Go figure.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.720
[in Norwegian]
Henriksen, what are you doing here?

22:52.560 --> 22:55.240
We have to redress your wound.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.400
[in English]
It sounds wonderful,

22:56.480 --> 22:59.000
but I was just having a conversation
with the tiger boy in there

22:59.080 --> 23:00.840
and, uh, we had quite a breakthrough.

23:00.920 --> 23:05.200
Turns out that he's a big fan
of the old gangster movies.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.800
I was wondering if you had
any of those channels

23:07.880 --> 23:10.240
that show those old gangster movies.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.160
Or I could maybe donate a satellite.

23:12.240 --> 23:16.360
[in Norwegian]
No. We prefer NRK.

23:16.440 --> 23:20.040
There's so much violence
on the other channels.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.120
[in English]
Are you kidding me?

23:21.200 --> 23:24.040
You think kids want to watch
a camera on the front of a friggin' boat?

23:24.120 --> 23:28.600
[in Norwegian] We need you to stay
in your room so we can find you.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.520
- Hi.
- [Laila] Hi.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.920
Got a light?

23:41.600 --> 23:42.960
Yes, of course.

23:47.040 --> 23:51.200
- Sell many Christmas trees this year?
- Christmas trees?

23:52.880 --> 23:56.960
- I'm kind of in a hurry.
- Let me get to the point.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.800
What happened to your truck?

23:59.920 --> 24:01.120
My truck?

24:02.320 --> 24:05.160
What do you care?
You aren't a cop anymore.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.800
True, but...

24:07.880 --> 24:09.520
...now I work for...

24:11.160 --> 24:12.960
...an insurance company.

24:15.480 --> 24:19.520
- You know what this is about, right?
- I really am in a hurry.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.520
[Laila] Hey!

24:22.560 --> 24:24.520
Either you talk to me,

24:24.600 --> 24:27.040
or I talk to my ex-colleagues.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.320
Okay?

24:29.400 --> 24:31.000
Okay, fine. I'll talk to you.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.200
[laughing]

24:39.640 --> 24:41.320
Mr. Dag is here to see you.

24:56.440 --> 24:58.080
[Dag]  Thank you for seeing me.

24:58.160 --> 25:01.160
I really don't want to bother you
with my personal issues

25:01.240 --> 25:03.480
now that you've been shot
and everything...

25:03.560 --> 25:05.600
But you're gonna anyway.

25:05.680 --> 25:10.800
Well, you know I've been trying to enter
the Christmas tree business, and--

25:10.880 --> 25:14.280
- A bad idea, I believe I suggested.
- Yeah, you were right.

25:14.360 --> 25:17.080
That damn dealer ripped me off,

25:17.160 --> 25:21.960
so, um, I thought it would be best
just to, well, you know,

25:22.040 --> 25:25.080
dump the truck
and cash in on the insurance.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.360
So?

25:27.440 --> 25:30.880
[Dag] So, the insurance company
hired a private detective.

25:30.960 --> 25:36.800
And, well, she's saying that
she can prove that I rigged the accident.

25:38.040 --> 25:41.120
And I'm supposed to fix this, how?

25:42.600 --> 25:45.280
Well, I thought maybe
you could talk to her,

25:45.360 --> 25:50.000
because, uh, she's
an old friend of yours... Laila Hovland.

25:52.720 --> 25:55.440
- Laila's a private dick now?
- Yeah, it seems so.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.720
[Johnny] You hear this,
Moe, Larry and Curly? Huh?

25:58.800 --> 26:03.200
Dag just saved your sorry asses.
We're bringing in a private dick.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.640
A private dick?

26:05.720 --> 26:09.120
[Johnny] Yeah. Someone who can
actually find the fucks that shot me.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.720
[Torgeir in Norwegian] Oh, I see.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.360
Salute.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.400
[Laila in Norwegian]
Well done on your new office.

26:24.320 --> 26:28.680
Just to make myself clear...
I don't usually take jobs like this.

26:28.760 --> 26:32.720
[in English] Look. All I need is the who,
what, where and why on these punks.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.000
You won't even get your hands dirty.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.400
Come on.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.440
Want to spend your retirement
in institution diapers,

26:40.520 --> 26:43.040
or sipping Sangria on a beach in Spain?

26:44.680 --> 26:49.160
I've got six figures waiting for you.
In kroner

26:49.240 --> 26:50.240
Please.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.320
[sighs] You had me at Sangria.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.920
[in Norwegian]
Bye, honey.

27:12.200 --> 27:17.120
No one in there had heard
of a one-armed Baltic woman.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.440
Fine, then we'll keep looking.
Let's see...

27:21.840 --> 27:24.280
- Are those all massage parlors?
- Mm.

27:24.360 --> 27:29.360
- I got the list from a friend in Vice.
- [sighs] We can't visit all those.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.600
[scoffs]

27:30.680 --> 27:32.520
Welcome to the private eye business.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.400
It might go more quickly
if you didn't have...

27:37.400 --> 27:40.160
...a hand job
at every place we visit.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.840
What are you talking about?

27:42.920 --> 27:45.760
[chuckles] The whole car reeks
of almond oil.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.160
[man on TV]  Suppose you think
I ought to go to?

28:06.240 --> 28:07.400
No.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.400
Maybe it was selfish of me, Tom,

28:09.480 --> 28:12.160
but somebody has got to stay here
and take care of Ma.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.320
Any word on the one-armed broad?

28:22.400 --> 28:23.480
No, sorry.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.720
Where are you going, Jerry?
It's just getting good.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.640
- What's all this?
- Wow.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.160
[Torgeir in Norwegian] It's like
a miniature version of Lillehammer.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.200
[in English]
Did you do this?

28:40.760 --> 28:42.040
Wait a minute.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.760
This is the crime scene. Huh?

28:45.840 --> 28:48.000
That's the hotel. Huh?

28:52.000 --> 28:55.040
And... And this is you.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.600
[chuckles]

28:57.680 --> 28:59.680
This kid's a pastry da Vinci.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.880
[Torgeir in Norwegian] Look.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.920
It's a car.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.840
[Johnny in English] Yeah,
it's a car with a license plate.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.800
That wouldn't be
the accurate license plate, would it?

29:14.000 --> 29:17.560
"We're partners, ain't we, Rocky?
We're partners."

29:21.440 --> 29:23.200
Get Laila on the phone.

29:25.880 --> 29:28.840
[in Norwegian]
Hi. You're all alone in here again.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.440
Hmm?

29:35.000 --> 29:38.440
You're obsessed
with those blue shoe covers.

29:39.800 --> 29:44.200
If you let the little things slide,
everything slides.

29:44.280 --> 29:47.960
Rationalistic puritans like you

29:48.040 --> 29:50.120
need counterparts,

29:50.200 --> 29:52.360
like Henriksen.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.640
You are exceptionally lucid today.

30:00.800 --> 30:04.800
My frontal lobe must have been
stimulated by having a roommate.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.520
Mm.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.680
I should probably inform you

30:09.760 --> 30:11.560
that I urinated on that.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.360
[stammers] On this?

30:15.960 --> 30:17.800
Thanks for telling me.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.040
[man on TV]  You're a liar, Tom.
You're covering up.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.640
Incoming.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.640
Change it to NRK.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.720
Um...

30:25.800 --> 30:27.400
- [Torgeir] I don't--
- Come on!

30:33.920 --> 30:35.440
[sighs]

30:56.680 --> 30:59.000
[phone ringing]

31:06.160 --> 31:09.280
- [in Lithuanian] I can't reach her.
- I told you so.

31:09.360 --> 31:13.680
You chased away our best girl
with your temper.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.000
Mom, don't be like that.

31:16.280 --> 31:19.480
Your father would never
have let this happen.

31:19.560 --> 31:22.040
My father, my father...
When will you let that go?

31:29.560 --> 31:31.880
[door opens, closes]

31:31.960 --> 31:33.240
Uh... [clears throat]

31:33.320 --> 31:36.320
[in Norwegian] Just wait on the bed.
I'll be out in a minute.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.560
Dad, what the hell are you doing here?

31:52.640 --> 31:54.000
[father sighs]

31:55.960 --> 31:57.520
[father] Sorry, I...

31:58.600 --> 32:01.800
I didn't know how else to find you.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.360
Put some clothes on.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.600
You don't work in a nail salon.

32:23.760 --> 32:24.760
No.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.000
Why not come home with me?

32:37.920 --> 32:40.440
[Roy] For how long
are we expected to do this?

32:40.520 --> 32:42.080
[Laila] Be patient.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.160
That license number Johnny gave us...

32:45.280 --> 32:49.160
...has had tons of parking tickets
in this area.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.920
Read that number again.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.640
BN 97748.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.480
Yes! That's it.

33:09.920 --> 33:12.880
[in English] Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is going on here?

33:12.960 --> 33:16.400
[in Norwegian] I haven't had a chance
to clean up. Things have been busy.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.960
- [in English] Busy?
- Yeah.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.040
Fucking pigsty.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.880
The power's gone, too?

33:22.960 --> 33:24.680
[Torgeir] Yeah, it's strange.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.640
[everyone] Surprise!

33:28.720 --> 33:30.120
[cheering]

33:35.080 --> 33:36.840
It's Gary U.S. Bonds.

33:36.920 --> 33:41.200
[singing "Auld Lang Syne"]

33:41.280 --> 33:42.640
- I'm impressed.
- Yeah.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.280
I'm glad you liked him.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.400
- Thank you, thank you.
- He was expensive.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.080
[everyone] Happy New Year.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.600
It's the middle of fucking January.

34:09.680 --> 34:13.560
[singing "This Little Girl"]

34:14.280 --> 34:15.440
Gary!

[snoring]

34:53.320 --> 34:55.200
[shouting]

34:55.280 --> 34:58.000
[in Norwegian]
Hey, pay attention. Pay attention!

35:06.120 --> 35:08.160
[in Lithuanian]
Nobody but me hits my girls!

35:09.080 --> 35:11.640
[camera shutter clicking]

35:13.560 --> 35:15.000
[in Norwegian] She's crazy!

35:15.080 --> 35:18.680
We should check with Johnny
before we approach her.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.080
[Laila] Seems wise.

35:28.840 --> 35:32.080
That was fucking great.
They don't write them like that anymore.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.680
Yeah, I wish I could stay, man.

35:33.760 --> 35:37.200
I've got to get back tonight. It's my
grandson's baptism, you know.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.320
No, I understand.

35:38.400 --> 35:43.240
Before you go, Mr. U.S. Bonds, there seems
to be some charges on your room,

35:43.320 --> 35:49.720
like a pizza, two beers, chocolate,
shoeshine, pay-TV, you know?

35:49.800 --> 35:52.560
Is this going to be a problem?

35:52.640 --> 35:53.640
Not at all.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.640
- Give my best to your grandson.
- I will. Thanks.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.280
- Thanks for coming.
- You bet.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.000
You tried to charge
Gary Bonds for room charges?

36:04.080 --> 36:05.480
You know how those Americans can eat.

36:05.560 --> 36:09.640
What's the matter with you?
That's the legendary Gary U.S. Bonds.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.160
But he wasn't--

36:11.240 --> 36:14.480
[in Norwegian] There's a guy
in your office who says he knows you.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.440
He says his name is Muhammad Ali.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.720
[in English]
Oh, this I gotta see.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.080
Can I help you?

36:31.080 --> 36:33.600
[Jan in Arabic]
Peace be upon you, Johnny.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.360
[in English]
What the fuck are you doing here?

36:39.800 --> 36:41.440
I came home.

36:41.840 --> 36:45.800
Are you out of your fucking mind? Huh?

36:45.880 --> 36:49.160
You think growing a beard and changing
your name is gonna fool the police?

36:50.160 --> 36:52.960
I had a spiritual awakening.

36:53.040 --> 36:57.160
At first I turned to Islam
for integrational purposes.

36:57.240 --> 37:01.040
Oh, yes, but Allah spoke to me,

37:01.120 --> 37:04.120
and immediately I knew what I had to do.

37:05.120 --> 37:09.240
To come home
and confess what I did to Randi.

37:12.240 --> 37:16.520
Listen to me,
you half-an-ayatollah ungrateful fuck!

37:16.600 --> 37:20.600
A lot of people helped you, getting
through that little incident of yours.

37:22.320 --> 37:26.040
They will be implicated
if you start blabbing.

37:26.120 --> 37:30.200
Johnny, I will not mention
anyone else, I promise.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.440
Why didn't you just stay disappeared?

37:42.000 --> 37:46.400
I knew I never should have come here.
I'm so sorry. I really am.

37:58.760 --> 38:04.040
[Gary U.S. Bond's
"Club Soul City" playing]

38:16.040 --> 38:17.360
[Oscarito in English]
Listen, Roarito,

38:17.440 --> 38:20.000
I was wondering if you could
do me a little favor?

38:20.080 --> 38:21.400
[Roar] What kind of favor?

38:21.480 --> 38:24.360
I just need to deliver
a package to some friends.

38:24.440 --> 38:25.920
Bring it on the boat
for the wedding cruise.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.480
My friends will meet you
in international waters.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.880
But why can't they
just pick it up themselves?

38:30.960 --> 38:34.080
[Oscarito] Let's say they're not
so popular with the coastguard.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.040
- [Roar] I don't know, man.
- Oh, come on.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.440
Two small bags.

38:38.520 --> 38:41.040
Don't tell me my sister
is about to marry a chicken.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.960
You would make me very happy.

38:46.040 --> 38:49.560
Here, take my sister
for a nice honeymoon.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.200
If you can promise it's not dangerous.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.320
[Oscarito] Don't you trust your best man?

38:56.480 --> 38:58.560
[in Brazilian Portuguese]
Come on, Rodrigo. This fool is clueless.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.680
[tires screeching]

39:24.320 --> 39:29.360
- [in Norwegian] You're still here?
- We have an insurance fraud case.

39:29.440 --> 39:35.040
This video shows
the driver in a dry suit

39:35.120 --> 39:39.040
10 minutes before his truck
went through the ice.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.560
That seems suspicious.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.120
Come on,
let's go have a glass of sherry.

39:45.320 --> 39:47.360
- Sherry?
- Yes.

39:47.440 --> 39:52.760
After 30 years on the force, nothing
beats ending the day with a sherry.

39:53.880 --> 39:56.360
Okay. You're the "sherry-iff."

39:56.440 --> 39:58.720
[Jan] Excuse me for interrupting.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.720
My name is Muhammad Abdul Aziz Ali.

40:01.800 --> 40:02.920
I am--

40:03.000 --> 40:05.720
This is not a great time.
Could you come back tomorrow?

40:07.800 --> 40:10.320
Couldn't you work a little overtime?

40:11.600 --> 40:13.840
I'm here to confess a murder.

40:18.680 --> 40:22.200
And you acted alone?
No one else knew?

40:22.280 --> 40:24.800
Yes, absolutely. Only me.

40:24.880 --> 40:25.880
And...

40:35.480 --> 40:38.560
- Are you sure you don't want a lawyer?
- No.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.280
No. What good would that do me?

40:42.960 --> 40:47.680
Read through this
one more time before you sign.

40:48.800 --> 40:52.120
- Are you sure you don't want coffee?
- No, thanks.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.080
Maybe some chai tea?

40:55.080 --> 40:56.520
-   Chai?
-  Yes.

40:57.880 --> 41:00.320
Fine.
I'll see what I can do.

41:16.040 --> 41:19.280
[fireworks whistling, popping]

41:32.160 --> 41:34.000
[in Arabic] My God. Amen.

[sobbing]

41:49.120 --> 41:51.120
[fireworks popping]

41:54.240 --> 41:57.760
[in Englsih] Okay, be honest.
How do you think my new look is?

42:00.200 --> 42:03.120
[in Norwegian]
I saw it in some trendy magazine.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.320
A lot of cool guys are wearing it.

42:07.320 --> 42:10.840
But you know, then again,
who wants to be cool all the time?

42:11.840 --> 42:14.520
Yeah, I think I'll shave it.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.280
I'm going to shave it.

The year sure started bad,

42:26.160 --> 42:29.480
but I think it's going to be
a good one for all of us.

[rapid gunfire]

42:32.440 --> 42:34.920

this wasn't dangerous?

42:36.520 --> 42:37.760
- On three, we run.
- Okay.
