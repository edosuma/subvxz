WEBVTT

00:03.471 --> 00:05.239
- ALL RIGHT, TOMMY,
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TRYING

00:05.273 --> 00:06.707
TO GET YOU
TO COME OVER HERE FOR YEARS,

00:06.740 --> 00:08.076
JUST TO TRY MY SAUCE.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.610
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I MAKE, REALLY.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.545
- YEAH, WELL, I GOT
A LOT MORE TIME NOW.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.581
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
MY WHOLE LIFE LATELY.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.617
I GO TO FRIENDS' HOUSES
AND TASTE THEIR FOOD.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.087
TO ME, IT'S MORE RELAXING
THAN MANAGING.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.722
- HERE.
HERE YOU GO.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.757
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

00:23.791 --> 00:25.526
- YOU MADE THIS SAUCE?
- YEAH, YEAH.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.261
IT'S MY MOTHER'S RECIPE.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.363
- I GOT TO TELL YOU,
IT'S A LITTLE BUSH LEAGUE.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.764
COME ON OVER HERE.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.066
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:32.100 --> 00:33.701
- WELL, IT NEEDS
MORE SEASONING.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.137
OKAY, PUT A LITTLE
HOT PEPPER IN IT.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.172
ALL RIGHT,
NOW LET ME SEE YOU STIR.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.640
- OH, YOU KNOW, I JUST STIR.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.642
- HEY, LOOK AT THE WAY
YOU'RE HOLDING THE SPOON.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.444
CHOKE UP ON IT A LITTLE.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.379
OKAY, GET YOUR HEAD DOWN,
ALL RIGHT.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.481
BEND YOUR KNEES,
FOLLOW THROUGH,

00:47.515 --> 00:49.283
AND GIVE ME
SOME MORE STIRRING POWER,

00:49.317 --> 00:51.152
AND GET YOUR ELBOW UP.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.820
- I THOUGHT YOU JUST
WANTED TO RELAX.

00:52.853 --> 00:56.324
- HEY, KEEP YOUR EYE
ON THE SAUCE.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.825
ROOKIES.

01:00.694 --> 01:01.729
- HI, I'M RAY,

01:01.762 --> 01:02.763
AND I LIVE HERE
IN LONG ISLAND

01:02.796 --> 01:04.565
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.100
SHE'S GREAT
WITH THE KIDS,

01:06.134 --> 01:08.169
THE HOUSE,
EVERYTHING.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.870
OH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE DOES IT.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.572
WE'VE GOT
A DAUGHTER, ALLY,

01:11.605 --> 01:14.242
AND TWIN
TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:14.275 --> 01:17.311
IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THE KIDS.

01:17.345 --> 01:20.614
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:20.648 --> 01:21.882
THAT'S RIGHT,

01:21.915 --> 01:24.785
AND MY BROTHER
LIVES WITH THEM.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.387
NOW, NOT EVERY FAMILY

01:26.420 --> 01:27.888
WOULD GO BY
ON A CONVEYER BELT FOR YOU,

01:27.921 --> 01:29.690
BUT MINE WOULD,
BECAUSE--

01:29.723 --> 01:32.326
- EVERYBODY
LOVES RAYMOND.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.727
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:44.405 --> 01:45.673
- [gasp]

01:45.706 --> 01:47.308
GOD, RAY, WHAT IS THAT?

01:47.341 --> 01:48.442
- OH, NO.

01:48.476 --> 01:51.845
IT'S COMING
FROM MY PARENTS' HOUSE.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.548
MY FATHER PUT IN ONE OF THOSE
NEW MOTION-SENSOR LIGHTS.

01:54.582 --> 01:57.451
- GOD, IT'S LIKE THE MOTHER SHIP
IS LANDING.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.787
- I TOLD THEM NOT
TO MAKE IT SO SENSITIVE.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.590
A MOTH PROBABLY FLEW BY.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.593
LET'S SEE
WHAT'S OUT THERE.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.195
- WHAT DO YOU SEE?

02:07.228 --> 02:09.197
- I THINK I SAW MY OWN RETINA.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.300
- WHAT'S YOUR FATHER DOING?

02:12.333 --> 02:13.634
- HIS STUPID CAR
IS ON THE STREET,

02:13.667 --> 02:14.568
AND HE THINKS THIS LIGHT

02:14.602 --> 02:16.570
IS GOING TO KEEP PEOPLE
FROM STEALING IT.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.339
- WELL, WHY DOESN'T
HE JUST GET A CAR ALARM?

02:18.372 --> 02:21.442
[car alarm sounds]

02:24.878 --> 02:29.217
[buzz saw revving]

02:31.619 --> 02:33.954
- YOUR FATHER
IS DRIVING ME NUTS, RAY.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.823
DID YOU CALL HIM?

02:35.856 --> 02:36.824
- NOBODY'S ANSWERING.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.693
THEY'RE PROBABLY DEAF
BY NOW.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.696
WHY IS HE WOODWORKING
AT 7:30 IN THE MORNING?

02:42.730 --> 02:48.336
- BECAUSE SOME GENIUS GAVE HIM
THE BIG BOOK OF HOBBIES.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.370
- I WANTED TO GIVE HIM
SOMETHING TO DO

02:49.403 --> 02:51.372
SO HE'D STOP COMING
OVER HERE AND ANNOYING US.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.406
- YEAH, SO NOW HE'S--

02:52.440 --> 02:53.774
[buzz saw revs]

02:53.807 --> 02:55.343
SO NOW HE'S--

02:55.376 --> 02:56.610
[revving]
SO NOW HE'S--

02:56.644 --> 02:57.678
[revving]

02:57.711 --> 02:59.413
GOOD IDEA, RAY!

03:07.588 --> 03:10.924
- YOU HAD TO GIVE HIM
THE BIG BOOK OF HOBBIES.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.529
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS
TO TAKE A NAP.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.631
[revving]

03:17.665 --> 03:21.502
OH, GOD,
IT'S LOUD HERE TOO.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.537
- WHAT'D YOU DO
TO YOUR NOSE, ROBERT?

03:23.571 --> 03:26.006
- DAD'S CAR ALARM
WOKE ME UP LAST NIGHT.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.708
I RAN OUTSIDE
TO TURN IT OFF,

03:27.741 --> 03:29.343
FORGOT WE HAD
AN OAK TREE.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.914
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, RAYMOND.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.450
- HOW IS YOUR NOSE
MY FAULT?

03:36.484 --> 03:38.452
- IF DAD HADN'T TURNED
HIS GARAGE INTO A WORKSHOP,

03:38.486 --> 03:40.254
HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PARK
ON THE STREET,

03:40.288 --> 03:41.489
AND HE WOULDN'T NEED
A CAR ALARM

03:41.522 --> 03:43.391
THAT GOES OFF
EVERY TIME I BLOW MY NOSE,

03:43.424 --> 03:46.260
WHICH NOW, THANKS TO YOU,
INVOLVES BLOOD.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.031
I'M A COP.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.800
I NEED MY SLEEP.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.269
- HEY, I'M A WORKING MAN TOO,
YOU KNOW?

03:55.303 --> 03:57.971
- OH, YEAH. SPORTSWRITER.
TOUGH JOB.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.308
A LOT OF SHOOT-OUTS
AT THE COMPUTER?

04:02.443 --> 04:04.312
- DID YOU TALK
TO YOUR MOM, ROBERT?

04:04.345 --> 04:05.779
- WELL, SINCE DAD'S
IN THE GARAGE ALL DAY,

04:05.813 --> 04:08.048
I'M THE ONLY ONE
SHE HAS TO TALK TO.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.551
AT LEAST THE BUZZ SAW
HAS AN OFF SWITCH.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.956
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN YOUR PAJAMAS?

04:15.989 --> 04:18.526
- OH, DAD, IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
FOR WOODWORKING, ISN'T IT?

04:18.559 --> 04:19.827
- NOT FOR ME.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.296
I'VE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.731
YOU KNOW THE SATISFACTION

04:23.764 --> 04:26.900
OF DOING SOMETHING
WITH YOUR OWN TWO HANDS?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.503
- I'M IMAGINING IT RIGHT NOW.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.575
- I LOVE
THE BIG BOOK OF HOBBIES.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.510
THE BEST GIFT
YOU EVER GAVE ME.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.512
OH, OH, HEY,
WHERE'S THE DRILL?

04:38.546 --> 04:39.647
- IN THE GARAGE.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.315
- GREAT, GREAT.
THANKS.

04:41.349 --> 04:47.488
[humming
"Ride of the Valkyries"]

04:47.521 --> 04:50.791
[telephone rings]
- OH, OH!

04:53.494 --> 04:55.028
- HELLO.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.764
OH, HI.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.032
IT'S RUTH GREEN
FROM TWO DOORS DOWN.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.734
[clears throat]
YEAH?

05:00.768 --> 05:03.704
OH, YEAH,
WE HEARD THE SAWING TOO.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.773
[Frank humming loudly]

05:05.806 --> 05:10.378
UH-HUH.
YEAH, THAT'S HIM SINGING.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.012
UH-HUH.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.747
OH.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.684
OKAY, WELL,
I'LL DISCUSS IT WITH RAY.

05:16.717 --> 05:17.885
YEAH.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.887
THANKS FOR CALLING, RUTH.
BYE-BYE.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.555
OH, GREAT.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.056
NOW THE NEIGHBORS
WANT TO COME OVER HERE TONIGHT

05:23.090 --> 05:24.825
TO DISCUSS YOUR PARENTS.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.894
- DISCUSS MY PARENTS?

05:26.927 --> 05:28.529
- THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.130
SHE ACTUALLY SAID,
"YOUR FAMILY,"

05:30.163 --> 05:33.734
LIKE I HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.136
- WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE
TO DISCUSS MY PARENTS?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.472
- I SHOULD HAVE KEPT
MY MAIDEN NAME.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.741
- I DON'T WANT THEM HERE.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.942
I DON'T WANT THEM OVER
AT THE HOUSE.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.544
- YOU KNOW WHAT, RAY?

05:43.577 --> 05:44.678
I DON'T THINK
IT'S SUCH A BAD IDEA.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.879
I MEAN, YOU GOT TO ADMIT,

05:45.913 --> 05:47.481
YOUR FATHER'S BEEN
MAKING A LOT OF NOISE,

05:47.515 --> 05:50.384
AND YOUR MOTHER
IS BIT OF A MEDDLER.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.452
- THEY'RE NOT SO BAD

05:51.485 --> 05:53.387
THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE
A MEETING.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.488
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO,

05:54.522 --> 05:56.524
COME OVER WITH TORCHES
AND PITCHFORKS?

05:56.557 --> 05:58.091
- NO, THEY JUST
WANT TO COME OVER

05:58.125 --> 05:59.793
TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM,

05:59.827 --> 06:02.663
AND YOU GOT TO ADMIT
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.598
I MEAN, THEY WOULDN'T
HAVE TO BE CALLING A MEETING

06:04.632 --> 06:08.902
IF THE WHOLE THING HADN'T
GOTTEN COMPLETELY INTOLERABLE.

06:08.936 --> 06:09.870
I MEAN, LOOK, THE NEIGHBORS

06:09.903 --> 06:12.105
JUST WANT TO COME OVER
TO ASK FOR OUR HELP,

06:12.139 --> 06:14.508
AND I THINK
THE LEAST WE CAN DO

06:14.542 --> 06:16.777
IS LISTEN TO WHAT
THEY HAVE TO SAY.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.148
- LOOK, I DON'T THINK
A MEETING IS NECESSARY, REALLY.

06:21.181 --> 06:24.585
- OKAY.
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE RIGHT NOW.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.587
I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE TO DO THIS,

06:26.620 --> 06:29.423
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL DO THIS FOR YOU.

06:29.457 --> 06:30.924
- THANKS.
- OKAY.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.932
- LOOK, WE ALL WANT TO LIVE
IN PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP,

06:38.966 --> 06:41.134
AND, RAY AND DEBRA, YOU'VE
ALWAYS BEEN GOOD NEIGHBORS.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.135
- THANK YOU. I JUST--

06:42.169 --> 06:44.872
- I WAS TALKING.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.908
AND SO, SINCE YOU TWO
ARE SO CLOSE TO THE PROBLEM,

06:47.941 --> 06:50.444
WE WERE HOPING THAT MAYBE
YOU COULD GET THROUGH TO THEM.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.713
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.648
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE NOISE:

06:54.682 --> 06:58.619
THE CAR ALARM,
THE BUZZ SAW, MY MOM.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.621
I'M GOING TO HANDLE IT, OKAY?

07:00.654 --> 07:03.957
GOOD MEETING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.126
YOU KNOW, TAKE SOME COOKIES.
MY MOM MADE THOSE.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.529
THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD.

07:08.562 --> 07:13.233
- WELL, THERE'S MORE TO IT
THAN JUST THE NOISE, RAY.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.035
- OH.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.937
- YOU KNOW YOUR FATHER'S
LEAF BLOWER?

07:16.970 --> 07:18.606
LAST WEEK,
HE BLEW EVERYTHING

07:18.639 --> 07:20.240
FROM HIS LAWN ONTO MINE,

07:20.273 --> 07:22.610
INCLUDING A DEAD CHIPMUNK.

07:23.811 --> 07:24.845
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.748
NOBODY SHOULD
BLOW RODENTS AROUND.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.082
- AND YOUR MOTHER
ACCEPTS MY PACKAGES,

07:29.116 --> 07:32.653
AND THEN SHE NEGLECTS
TO INFORM ME.

07:32.686 --> 07:33.954
- YEAH, YOU'RE MAD NOW,

07:33.987 --> 07:35.489
BUT WHEN ONE OF THOSE
BABIES EXPLODES,

07:35.523 --> 07:37.558
YOU'RE GOING TO THANK HER, HUH?

07:37.591 --> 07:39.760
- WE'RE VERY SERIOUS, RAY.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.194
WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL TALK
TO YOUR PARENTS

07:41.228 --> 07:42.796
ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS

07:42.830 --> 07:46.934
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO GO TO THE--EXTREME.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.636
- I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:48.669 --> 07:50.270
- WE COULD INITIATE
LEGAL ACTION

07:50.303 --> 07:52.573
AND TRY TO GET YOUR PARENTS
OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.107
- IS THAT POSSIBLE?

07:56.810 --> 07:57.645
NO. I--

08:02.816 --> 08:05.519
I'M JUST ASKING
A QUESTION.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.887
- NOBODY REALLY
WANTS THAT TO HAPPEN.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.288
I--I MEAN, THEY'RE OLDER PEOPLE.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.557
WHERE WOULD THEY GO?

08:09.590 --> 08:11.024
- FLORIDA.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.727
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:13.761 --> 08:15.663
- IT'S WARM IN FLORIDA.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.231
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
LET'S BACK UP HERE A SECOND.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.800
THEY--THEY MAKE A LITTLE NOISE,

08:19.833 --> 08:23.771
AND THEY CAN BE A LITTLE--
IRKSOME SOMETIMES,

08:23.804 --> 08:28.609
BUT COME ON, LET'S LOOK
AT THEIR GOOD POINTS TOO.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.712
THEY RECYCLE.

08:34.281 --> 08:37.017
THEY'RE NOT CANNIBALS.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.819
- I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO SHOW THIS,

08:38.852 --> 08:43.190
BUT--I HAVE A TAPE.

08:43.223 --> 08:46.259
- THEY ARE CANNIBALS?

08:46.293 --> 08:49.329
- THIS IS YOUR FATHER
GETTING HIS MORNING PAPER.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.264
- YOU'RE VIDEOTAPING
MY FATHER?

08:51.298 --> 08:53.934
- I SHOT THIS OVER THE COURSE
OF SEVERAL MORNINGS.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.076
THERE IT IS.

09:36.109 --> 09:36.944
EXHIBIT "A."

09:36.977 --> 09:38.278
- OOH!

09:38.311 --> 09:40.180
- IS THAT A TATTOO?

09:40.213 --> 09:41.682
- NO.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.952
all:
EWW!

09:48.756 --> 09:50.257
- LOOK AT WHAT
YOUR FATHER MADE.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.859
OH, HI!

09:51.892 --> 09:53.193
- ISN'T THIS A BEAUTY?

09:53.226 --> 09:54.227
OOH.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.629
OOH!

09:55.663 --> 09:57.030
[chuckling]
HEY. WHOOPS!

09:57.064 --> 09:59.900
LITTLE, UH--
PORNO PARTY.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.935
- COME ON OUTSIDE, DAD.
SHOW ME WHERE THIS GOES.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.303
COME ON, HELP ME TO
PUT IT UP IN THE TREE.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.238
- WHO'S THE FAT ASS?

10:07.908 --> 10:10.077
- FRANK.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.946
- HOLY CRAP.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.014
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

10:14.047 --> 10:15.382
- NOTHING.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.984
WE'RE JUST HAVING A FEW LAUGHS,
YOU KNOW.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.051
NEIGHBORHOOD BLOOPERS.

10:18.085 --> 10:21.088
- UH, THE TRUTH IS THAT
CERTAIN PEOPLE AROUND HERE

10:21.121 --> 10:23.356
HAVE SOME COMPLAINTS
ABOUT YOU.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.893
- WHICH CERTAIN PEOPLE?
- THEM.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.427
- MARIE, THIS IS NOT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.230
- IT LOOKS LIKE MY SON
IS PLOTTING AGAINST US

10:30.263 --> 10:34.301
AND SERVING MY COOKIES.

10:34.334 --> 10:38.138
YOU'RE SERVING MY COOKIES
AT YOUR RALLY?

10:38.171 --> 10:40.407
- YOU TOOK SIDES
AGAINST THE FAMILY.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.010
- DAD, I WAS DEFENDING YOU.

10:43.043 --> 10:47.080
- AGAINST THE FAMILY!

10:47.114 --> 10:48.348
- DAD, IT'S NOT--

10:48.381 --> 10:49.349
- I WANT THE TAPE.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.818
GIVE ME THE TAPE.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.419
- ALL RIGHT,
TAKE IT EASY, MOM.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.354
- HOW DO YOU WORK
THESE DAMN MACHINES?

10:54.387 --> 10:55.956
- ALL RIGHT, EASY, MA.
I'LL DO IT.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.125
- OOH, I HATE
THESE DAMN MACHINES.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.827
- MA, DON'T PULL THE PLUG.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.997
- HOW COULD YOU?

11:04.031 --> 11:05.398
- MA.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.307
OKAY, THAT WENT WELL.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.084
- DEBRA.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.720
DEBRA.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.823
DEBRA.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.424
- WHAT?

11:31.458 --> 11:32.793
WHAT IS THE MATTER?

11:32.826 --> 11:37.765
- I CAN'T SLEEP.
- WHY NOT?

11:37.798 --> 11:39.432
- MY DAD'S CAR ALARM.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.968
- IT'S NOT GOING OFF.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.103
- EXACTLY.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.371
I-I CAN'T STAND IT.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.040
IT'S JUST--
IT'S TOO QUIET OVER THERE.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.877
- MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU, RAY.

11:49.910 --> 11:50.978
WHOO, WHOO, WHOO!

11:51.011 --> 11:53.781
WEE-OOH,
WEE-OOH, WEE-OOH!

11:53.814 --> 11:55.883
GOOD NIGHT.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.051
- THAT DIDN'T HELP.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.252
I STILL HEAR
MY OWN GUILT.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.988
- OH, RAY, YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO BE GUILTY OF.

12:01.021 --> 12:01.989
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.090
- I DID, I DID.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.760
I HAD A RALLY AGAINST
MY PARENTS IN MY OWN HOUSE.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.296
DIDN'T YOU SEE THEM?
THEY WERE REALLY HURT.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.163
I COULD TELL BY THE WAY

12:10.197 --> 12:13.166
MY MOTHER WAS RUNNING
WITH THE VCR.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.402
- HONEY, I KNOW.
LOOK, I MEAN, I FELT BAD TOO,

12:15.435 --> 12:18.271
BUT MAYBE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO GET THROUGH TO THEM.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.439
- I HURT THEM.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.341
[thump]

12:21.374 --> 12:23.143
I HURT MYSELF.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.883
- RAY, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO FEEL GUILTY FOR.

12:29.917 --> 12:30.851
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.553
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
YOU WERE DEFENDING THEM.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.922
- OH, THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.825
GUILT IS JUST A WAY OF LIFE
FOR ME.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.327
I WAS TRAINED BY MASTERS.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.831
MY MOTHER,
MY FATHER, THE POPE.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.032
- [sighs]

12:45.065 --> 12:47.134
LISTEN.
JUST ENJOY THE QUIET, OKAY?

12:47.167 --> 12:48.335
GO TO SLEEP.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.942
- WEE-OOH, WEE-OOH.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.850
HELLO.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.185
HELLO.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.954
WHAT'S THIS?

13:06.987 --> 13:08.055
THEY KILLED THEMSELVES,

13:08.088 --> 13:11.825
AND ROBERT MADE 'EM
INTO SANDWICHES.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.126
HI.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.528
- HELLO.

13:15.562 --> 13:16.529
- LISTEN.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.231
I KNOW YOU'RE HURT,

13:18.265 --> 13:20.067
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.401
WE DIDN'T PLAN
THAT MEETING, YOU KNOW.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.903
THE NEIGHBORS
JUST CAME OVER.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.471
- WE'RE NOT HURT, DEAR.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.506
THE NEIGHBORS WERE RIGHT.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.841
- RIGHT?
- MM-HMM.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.177
- HEY, WE'RE NOT PERFECT.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.845
- WHAT?

13:31.879 --> 13:34.281
- WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW
OUR BEHAVIOR AFFECTED OTHERS.

13:34.314 --> 13:38.285
THESE PEOPLE AROUND HERE
ARE VERY NICE.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.587
- SO EVERYTHING'S OKAY WITH YOU?

13:40.620 --> 13:41.989
- YES.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.858
- WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.

13:44.892 --> 13:47.027
- WELL, GOOD.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.128
I'M GLAD YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.596
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
STILL BE UPSET.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.865
YOU KNOW, THAT MEETING
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.333
- AND IT WAS.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.235
- VERY CONSTRUCTIVE.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.569
- SO YOU'RE NOT MAD AT THE--

13:56.603 --> 13:59.973
- WE REALLY DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING MORE TO SAY, RAY.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.876
- OH.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.347
HEY, YOU GOT SOME
BIG SANDWICHES HERE.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.049
- OH, I'M SORRY, DEAR.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.885
THAT'S FOR THE NEIGHBORS.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.620
- THE NEIGHBORS
ARE COMING OVER?

14:13.653 --> 14:15.222
- YEAH, IT'S THE LEAST
WE COULD DO

14:15.255 --> 14:17.224
FOR ALL THE TROUBLE
WE'VE CAUSED.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.892
- SINCE WHEN DO YOU CARE
ABOUT THE TROUBLE?

14:18.926 --> 14:19.893
[knocking on door]

14:19.927 --> 14:23.096
- OH, THERE THEY ARE. HI.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.197
HI.
- HI.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.099
- OH, WELCOME,
WELCOME.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.036
HI, HOW ARE
YOU DOING?

14:29.069 --> 14:32.105
- OOH, CHAMPAGNE.
THAT'S FABULOUS.

14:32.139 --> 14:35.475
- HI, HI, HI.
OH, WOW, THANKS A LOT.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.910
- WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.111
YOU'RE ALL FRIENDS NOW?

14:38.145 --> 14:41.148
- HERE'S THE ICE.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.315
- OH, DARLING, FABULOUS.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.552
- GREAT JOB, SON.
GREAT JOB.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.988
- THANKS FOR STOPPING BY, RAY.

14:50.457 --> 14:56.196
[overlapping conversations]

15:35.202 --> 15:36.970
- CAN'T SLEEP, HUH?

15:47.480 --> 15:51.251
- IT'S IN THE BIBLE.
HONOR THY MOTHER.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.987
- WHAT ABOUT THE FATHER?

15:54.021 --> 15:56.456
- OKAY, HIM TOO.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.360
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.561
- RAY!

16:01.594 --> 16:02.629
- I'M COMING.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.108
I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.488
- OH, HI.
SORRY, FATHER.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.423
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
THE CONFESSIONAL.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.226
- THIS IS
THE CONFESSIONAL.

16:33.260 --> 16:37.330
- WELL, WHERE'S THE--
THE BOOTH WITH THE--

16:37.364 --> 16:40.133
THE KNEELER
AND THE SLIDING WINDOW

16:40.167 --> 16:43.670
THROUGH WHICH
YOU CAN'T SEE ME?

16:43.703 --> 16:45.772
- YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
IN AWHILE, HAVE YOU?

16:45.805 --> 16:47.207
- ABOUT 20 YEARS.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.476
I'VE BEEN GOOD.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.478
- WELL.
[clears throat]

16:51.511 --> 16:53.546
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE A SEAT?

17:06.293 --> 17:08.628
- OH, I START, RIGHT?
I START, OKAY.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.430
UH--

17:10.463 --> 17:13.233
BLESS ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.801
IT'S BEEN--
WELL, YOU KNOW,

17:14.834 --> 17:17.670
A LONG TIME SINCE
MY LAST CONFESSION.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.639
LET'S SEE.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.741
I'VE CURSED--

17:21.774 --> 17:26.313
ABOUT 90,000 TIMES,

17:26.346 --> 17:28.448
ATE A LOT OF MEAT
ON FRIDAYS.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.651
- OH, WE ABOLISHED THAT RULE
A LONG TIME AGO.

17:31.684 --> 17:36.356
- WOW, YOU GUYS
ARE CHANGING EVERYTHING.

17:36.389 --> 17:41.394
- NOW WHAT--WHAT REALLY BRINGS
YOU HERE AFTER 20 YEARS?

17:41.428 --> 17:44.131
- ALL RIGHT, THE THING IS,

17:44.164 --> 17:47.267
I THINK I BROKE
ONE OF THE COMMANDMENTS,

17:47.300 --> 17:50.437
THE ONE ABOUT HONOR THY FATHER
AND THY MOTHER.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.472
- REALLY?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.441
- THAT'S BAD, HUH?

17:54.474 --> 17:58.245
- I JUST DON'T
GET THAT ONE A LOT--

17:58.278 --> 18:01.814
AT LEAST NOT FROM SOMEONE
IN YOUR AGE GROUP.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.884
YOU'RE MORE IN THE
"COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE"

18:04.917 --> 18:07.654
PHASE OF LIFE.

18:07.687 --> 18:08.755
- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
THAT I DON'T LOVE

18:08.788 --> 18:10.523
MY MOTHER AND MY FATHER.

18:10.557 --> 18:14.561
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S VERY HARD
TO HONOR THEM.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.397
- OH.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.699
YOU'RE TRYING
TO PUT THEM IN A HOME.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.334
- NO, NO, NO.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.302
YOU SEE, THE NEIGHBORS

18:22.335 --> 18:24.271
WANTED TO THROW THEM
OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

18:24.304 --> 18:26.673
AND EVEN THOUGH
I WAS DEFENDING THEM

18:26.706 --> 18:28.608
AND THE NEIGHBORS
ARE OKAY NOW,

18:28.641 --> 18:31.611
I JUST--
I STILL FEEL GUILTY.

18:31.644 --> 18:35.182
- IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
YOU DID ANYTHING WRONG.

18:35.215 --> 18:38.851
- WELL, THEN HOW COME
I FEEL SO LOUSY?

18:38.885 --> 18:42.455
- MAYBE YOUR GUILT'S
COMING FROM A DEEPER PLACE.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:44.324 --> 18:47.794
- HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS?

18:51.231 --> 18:52.699
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

18:55.768 --> 18:58.505
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT MAYBE I FEEL THIS WAY

18:58.538 --> 19:03.910
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN, I THINK
THE NEIGHBORS ARE RIGHT?

19:03.943 --> 19:05.945
THAT PART OF ME
WANTS TO THROW THEM

19:05.978 --> 19:08.381
OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD TOO?

19:08.415 --> 19:12.319
THAT--THAT THEY'VE BEEN JUST
DRIVING ME CRAZY MY WHOLE LIFE?

19:12.352 --> 19:16.389
IS THAT--THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, ISN'T IT?

19:16.423 --> 19:19.692
- WE ALL HAVE THESE KINDS
OF FEELINGS FROM TIME TO TIME.

19:19.726 --> 19:20.860
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A MAN

19:20.893 --> 19:24.564
ON OUR CHURCH COUNCIL
A FEW YEARS AGO,

19:24.597 --> 19:28.835
A DECENT ENOUGH FELLOW
BUT A BIT ABRASIVE,

19:28.868 --> 19:33.340
OBLIVIOUS TO
ANYONE ELSE'S FEELINGS.

19:33.373 --> 19:37.510
I WANTED TO GET HIM
OUT OF MY HAIR.

19:37.544 --> 19:41.714
I USED TO FANTASIZE ABOUT HIM
CONVERTING TO JUDAISM.

19:45.418 --> 19:48.455
ONE DAY I SAID,
"FRANK, I THINK THAT--"

19:48.488 --> 19:50.523
- WAIT A MINUTE.
HIS NAME WAS FRANK?

19:50.557 --> 19:51.858
- UH, THAT'S UNIMPORTANT.
THE POINT--

19:51.891 --> 19:54.994
- FRANK BARONE?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.696
- YOU KNOW FRANK BARONE?

19:56.729 --> 19:58.331
- HE'S MY FATHER.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.600
- YOUR PARENTS
ARE FRANK AND MARIE BARONE?

20:00.633 --> 20:02.535
- YES.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.337
- YOU'RE ABSOLVED.

20:06.939 --> 20:10.443
- WHAT?

20:10.477 --> 20:13.880
- OUR LORD
FORGIVES YOUR THOUGHTS.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.282
- YEAH? REALLY?

20:15.315 --> 20:16.816
ARE YOU--
YOU'RE SURE?

20:16.849 --> 20:20.653
- WELL, I COULD LOOK IT UP,
BUT I'M ALMOST POSITIVE.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.856
- OH, MAN.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.325
THANK YOU, FATHER.

20:25.358 --> 20:28.328
THIS IS, UH,
THIS IS GREAT.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.463
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

20:30.497 --> 20:33.300
WOULD I BE WRONG
TO LET THEM KNOW HOW I FEEL?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.302
THAT I'M--I'M JUST SICK
AND TIRED OF BEING MANIPULATED

20:35.335 --> 20:36.936
AND TREATED LIKE A CHILD,

20:36.969 --> 20:39.506
AND I'M JUST NOT GOING TO
LET 'EM DO IT ANYMORE.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.609
- ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE THE NAME
OF THE LORD IN VAIN WHEN YOU DO?

20:42.642 --> 20:46.513
- NO.
- THEN GO WITH GOD.

20:46.546 --> 20:50.283
- OH, BOY.
YOU, UH, YOU GUYS.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.050
YOU'RE GREAT.
YOU'RE GREAT.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.719
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.986
I'M GOING TO TELL
ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT YOU.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.488
REALLY.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.735
ALL RIGHT, MOM AND DAD,

21:08.768 --> 21:10.403
LISTEN UP HERE,
ALL RIGHT.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.738
I DON'T CARE WHAT
YOU THINK ABOUT ME.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.606
THIS HAS BEEN
A LONG TIME COMING.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.443
I'M GOING TO SAY IT RIGHT NOW,
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR IT.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.881
- SAY WHAT YOU WANT
TO SAY, RAY.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.950
WE'RE LISTENING.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.885
- WELL?

21:25.918 --> 21:27.987
- LISTEN--

21:28.020 --> 21:29.956
I'M SORRY.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.324
- HE SAID IT!

21:31.358 --> 21:34.327
OH, RAYMOND.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.564
- GOOD THING.
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.799
- THAT'S ALL WE EVER
WANTED TO HEAR, HONEY.

21:39.832 --> 21:42.068
THAT'S ALL ANY PARENT
EVER WANTS FROM A CHILD.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.804
- CONSTANT APOLOGY.
RIGHT.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.973
- GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, RAY.
WE MISSED YOU.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.508
- ARE YOU HUNGRY, HONEY?

21:48.541 --> 21:50.977
- YEAH, YEAH, I'M HUNGRY.
- OH, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

21:51.010 --> 21:54.514
- HEY, ROBERT, UH,
THIS IS RAY'S CHAIR.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.822
THERE YOU GO.
GO ON, SIT DOWN.

22:02.855 --> 22:06.726
THE OLD--
THE OLD CHAIR.

22:06.759 --> 22:07.894
- ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.

22:07.927 --> 22:11.498
- HERE YOU GO.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.600
MANGEZ, MANGEZ.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.074
- I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY IT BOTHERS YOU.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.576
BUT IT'S QUITE NORMAL

22:23.610 --> 22:26.713
TO HAVE THOUGHTS
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS DYING.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.519
- DID I MENTION THE PART
ABOUT THE SANDWICHES?
