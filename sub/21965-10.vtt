00:02.417 --> 00:03.375
DANI:

00:02.417 --> 00:03.375
Fried chicken,

00:03.417 --> 00:05.375
salad,

00:03.417 --> 00:05.375
lemonade...

00:05.417 --> 00:08.959
and our very own

00:05.417 --> 00:08.959
private shady spot.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.542
Thanks, Cody!

00:10.583 --> 00:12.125
No problem,

00:10.583 --> 00:12.125
sis!

00:12.166 --> 00:15.083
BLADES ( whispers ):

00:12.166 --> 00:15.083
I don't get it.

00:12.166 --> 00:15.083
If Dani likes Taylor,

00:15.125 --> 00:17.458
why does she make him

00:15.125 --> 00:17.458
eat her potato salad?

00:17.500 --> 00:19.208
I think that's her meatloaf.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.625
( buzzing )

00:24.041 --> 00:25.250
What was that?

00:25.291 --> 00:27.542
Oh, sorry, Taylor...

00:25.291 --> 00:27.542
picnic's over.

00:27.583 --> 00:29.083
Robot,

00:27.583 --> 00:29.083
Copter mode!

00:30.750 --> 00:32.250
(  action theme playing  )

00:35.208 --> 00:36.500
I'll call the team.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.375
HEATWAVE:

00:39.000 --> 00:41.375
Rescue Bots,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.375
roll to the rescue!

00:41.417 --> 00:42.750
( sirens blaring )

00:44.250 --> 00:45.834
( whistling )

00:48.291 --> 00:49.709
Not so close!

00:49.750 --> 00:51.917
Do you see what that thing

00:49.750 --> 00:51.917
does to metal?

00:51.959 --> 00:54.000
Dad,

00:51.959 --> 00:54.000
it's headed toward the docks!

00:54.041 --> 00:55.291
( buzzing )

00:58.750 --> 01:00.667
Boulder, follow me.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.667
We'll cut it off.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.375

( beeps )

02:06.000 --> 02:07.500
( buzzing slows and stops )

02:08.959 --> 02:11.709
That device is irreplaceable.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.208
Uncle Woodrow?

02:13.250 --> 02:15.208
( sighs )

02:13.250 --> 02:15.208
Woodrow.

02:16.542 --> 02:17.625
Uncle Woodrow!

02:17.667 --> 02:18.959
Why didn't you tell us

02:17.667 --> 02:18.959
you were coming?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.250
I can't believe it's you!

02:20.291 --> 02:21.542
Uncle?

02:21.583 --> 02:23.291
Human term for sibling

02:21.583 --> 02:23.291
of a parent.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.500
In this case--

02:23.333 --> 02:25.500
Chief's brother.

02:25.542 --> 02:27.333
Chief didn't tell us he was

02:25.542 --> 02:27.333
coming to visit.

02:27.375 --> 02:28.917
Or that he existed.

02:28.959 --> 02:30.291
Wonderful.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.792
( laughing )

02:32.834 --> 02:34.959
I'll answer your questions,

02:35.000 --> 02:37.333
just let me look at you

02:35.000 --> 02:37.333
a second.

02:37.375 --> 02:39.458
Cody,

02:37.375 --> 02:39.458
you've grown a foot.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.041
Now you'll need three socks.

02:41.083 --> 02:42.500
( laughs )

02:42.542 --> 02:45.500
Did you kids get

02:42.542 --> 02:45.500
my postcards from Dwarma?

02:45.542 --> 02:48.500
Or the scorpions I sent

02:45.542 --> 02:48.500
from Ecuador?

02:48.542 --> 02:50.500
Um...

02:48.542 --> 02:50.500
never got those.

02:50.542 --> 02:51.834
Oh.

02:51.875 --> 02:53.542
I thought I sent 'em...

02:53.583 --> 02:55.000
may have forgotten.

02:55.041 --> 02:56.875
Gee,

02:55.041 --> 02:56.875
imagine that.

02:56.917 --> 02:58.208
Woodrow,

02:56.917 --> 02:58.208
this, uh,

02:58.250 --> 03:00.041
floating menace belongs to you?

03:02.208 --> 03:04.667
Good to see you too,

03:02.208 --> 03:04.667
big brother.

03:04.709 --> 03:07.750
Come here,

03:04.709 --> 03:07.750
give me a decent hello.

03:07.792 --> 03:09.709
( grunting and groaning )

03:09.750 --> 03:11.250
Okay, Woody,

03:09.750 --> 03:11.250
okay...

03:11.291 --> 03:13.917
High-grade titanium...

03:13.959 --> 03:17.667
laser drill... self-propulsion

03:13.959 --> 03:17.667
and sonar tracking...

03:17.709 --> 03:19.250
That's quite a device,

03:17.709 --> 03:19.250
Uncle Woodrow.

03:19.291 --> 03:22.500
Yeah.

03:19.291 --> 03:22.500
It's my Deep Earth Scout.

03:22.542 --> 03:25.667
Designed to drill underground

03:22.542 --> 03:25.667
and collect data.

03:25.709 --> 03:28.625
And you won't believe

03:25.709 --> 03:28.625
what it found.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.083
This is it,

03:28.667 --> 03:30.083
Charlie.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.875
What I've been looking for

03:30.125 --> 03:31.875
my whole life.

03:31.917 --> 03:36.333
Evidence that aliens may have

03:31.917 --> 03:36.333
visited the earth centuries ago.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.709
Well, don't everybody get

03:38.750 --> 03:41.709
all excited at once.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.333
We're happy for you,

03:41.750 --> 03:43.333
Uncle Woodrow.

03:43.375 --> 03:44.959
It's-it's only that--

03:45.000 --> 03:47.375
I just wish your homecoming

03:45.000 --> 03:47.375
had been a little less...

03:47.417 --> 03:48.458
destructive.

03:48.500 --> 03:51.625
Hm...

03:48.500 --> 03:51.625
Sorry, Charlie.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.709
The DES must have

03:51.667 --> 03:53.709
accidentally activated

03:53.750 --> 03:55.125
when I was getting off

03:53.750 --> 03:55.125
the ferry.

03:56.125 --> 03:57.417
( sighs )

03:57.458 --> 04:00.041
Speaking of machines...

04:00.083 --> 04:01.458
( chuckles )

04:01.500 --> 04:04.333
Looks like you still have

04:01.500 --> 04:04.333
the best toys.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.458
Where on Earth did you get

04:04.375 --> 04:06.458
these guys, Charlie?

04:06.500 --> 04:08.583
Uh, they're our

04:06.500 --> 04:08.583
rescue robots.

04:08.625 --> 04:10.750
Uh, state-of-the-art

04:08.625 --> 04:10.750
emergency stuff.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.000
Watch what they can do,

04:10.792 --> 04:13.000
Uncle Woodrow!

04:13.041 --> 04:14.875
Robots,

04:13.041 --> 04:14.875
vehicle mode.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.208
Whoa.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.917
Impressive.

04:23.250 --> 04:24.625
Hey,

04:23.250 --> 04:24.625
what's the mileage like?

04:24.667 --> 04:26.208
( laughs )

04:28.083 --> 04:29.291
Now Woodrow,

04:28.083 --> 04:29.291
you c--

04:29.333 --> 04:30.625
Hey, what's for dinner?

04:30.667 --> 04:32.041
( groans )

04:32.083 --> 04:33.417
All right,

04:32.083 --> 04:33.417
go easy, Woodrow.

04:33.458 --> 04:35.875
This is not Dad's old jalopy.

04:36.291 --> 04:37.583
( siren blares )

04:37.625 --> 04:39.792
( engine roars )

04:45.083 --> 04:47.709
Well...

04:45.083 --> 04:47.709
that's Uncle Woodrow.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.208
Uncle Woodrow is an

04:47.750 --> 04:49.208
archeologist.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.166
Sort of.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.166
And an inventor.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.792
Sometimes.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.083
He's been around the world

04:52.834 --> 04:55.083
a lot...I think.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.458
He doesn't seem

04:55.125 --> 04:57.458
anything like the Chief.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.083
Look at me and Graham.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.709
Would you ever think

04:59.125 --> 05:00.709
a guy like me

05:00.750 --> 05:01.959
could have a brother

05:00.750 --> 05:01.959
like him?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.291
Come here you.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.291
Wha--?

05:03.333 --> 05:04.959
Kade!

05:03.333 --> 05:04.959
Ha, ha!

05:06.667 --> 05:08.959
I'm sure he meant it

05:06.667 --> 05:08.959
in a nice way.

05:10.792 --> 05:13.208
All my research

05:10.792 --> 05:13.208
has convinced me.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.333
Pictographs, pyramids,

05:13.250 --> 05:16.333
Stonehenge...

05:16.375 --> 05:19.875
They're alien artifacts,

05:16.375 --> 05:19.875
every one of them.

05:19.917 --> 05:23.500
But, uh, you kids probably don't

05:19.917 --> 05:23.500
believe in aliens, do you?

05:23.542 --> 05:26.041
It could happen...

05:23.542 --> 05:26.041
I'd consider the evidence...

05:26.083 --> 05:28.291
Nope. No way.

05:26.083 --> 05:28.291
I wouldn't say that we don't...

05:28.333 --> 05:30.792
Sit down and eat,

05:28.333 --> 05:30.792
Charlie.

05:30.834 --> 05:32.959
Dinner doesn't

05:30.834 --> 05:32.959
serve itself

05:33.000 --> 05:35.166
somebody has to cook

05:33.000 --> 05:35.166
and clean up.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.959
Well, uh,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.959
That's good, old Charlie...

05:40.000 --> 05:41.959
Nose to the grindstone.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.083
Say, pass the potatoes,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.083
will you?

05:44.125 --> 05:47.750
Then I'll show you

05:44.125 --> 05:47.750
what my DES found...

05:49.125 --> 05:50.917
HEATWAVE:

05:49.125 --> 05:50.917
Ugh, I don't get it.

05:50.959 --> 05:54.417
Why is Chief's brother so eager

05:50.959 --> 05:54.417
to find an alien, anyway?

05:54.458 --> 05:56.208
I know.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.709
With all the amazing things

05:56.250 --> 05:58.709
humans have on their own planet,

05:58.750 --> 06:01.166
why bother searching

05:58.750 --> 06:01.166
for... us?

06:01.208 --> 06:03.125
Because we're awesome.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.875
But who sends scorpions

06:03.166 --> 06:05.875
as gifts?

06:05.917 --> 06:07.333
No thank you.

06:07.375 --> 06:08.959
Who knows?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.041
Maybe he brought some scorpions

06:09.000 --> 06:11.041
along with him...

06:11.083 --> 06:12.500
( yelps )

06:12.542 --> 06:13.917
Very funny.

06:13.959 --> 06:15.625
All I know is,

06:15.667 --> 06:18.000
Woodrow Burns forced me

06:15.667 --> 06:18.000
to drive over the speed limit.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.500
And I was

06:18.041 --> 06:20.500
helpless to stop him.

06:20.542 --> 06:23.542
WOODROW:

06:20.542 --> 06:23.542
Now most people look for aliens

06:20.542 --> 06:23.542
in outer space...

06:25.291 --> 06:27.792
But my research made me

06:25.291 --> 06:27.792
realize...

06:27.834 --> 06:30.500
we should be looking

06:27.834 --> 06:30.500
in inner space.

06:30.542 --> 06:32.875
Underneath the earth.

06:32.917 --> 06:37.208
So I built and dispatched six

06:32.917 --> 06:37.208
DES spheres to gather data

06:37.250 --> 06:39.333
from all across the planet.

06:39.375 --> 06:41.542
Five of the devices are still

06:39.375 --> 06:41.542
out there somewhere,

06:41.583 --> 06:43.500
gathering data...

06:43.542 --> 06:47.458
But this baby uncovered all

06:43.542 --> 06:47.458
the evidence I need.

06:47.500 --> 06:51.750
Right in my old hometown.

06:47.500 --> 06:51.750
Well, under it.

06:51.792 --> 06:56.375
A cavern containing proof of

06:51.792 --> 06:56.375
a lost alien civilization.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.125
Housing structures...

06:58.166 --> 07:00.583
Looks like rock formations

06:58.166 --> 07:00.583
to me.

07:00.709 --> 07:02.291
Communication signals...

07:02.333 --> 07:03.291
( echoes )

07:03.333 --> 07:05.792
Or water dripping...

07:05.834 --> 07:08.417
Even aliens themselves...

07:10.333 --> 07:11.834
Shadows on the wall.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.917
That's the difference

07:11.875 --> 07:14.917
between us, Charlie.

07:14.959 --> 07:17.458
I'm curious to know for sure.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.834
So I'm going to borrow the

07:23.250 --> 07:26.834
town's old Forger, you remember?

07:26.875 --> 07:29.458
We found it when were kids,

07:26.875 --> 07:29.458
down where the tunnels end.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.750
That giant driller?

07:29.500 --> 07:32.750
It hasn't been used in years.

07:32.792 --> 07:35.000
I think

07:32.792 --> 07:35.000
I can get it running.

07:35.041 --> 07:37.959
Then I follow the coordinates

07:35.041 --> 07:37.959
the DES brought back...

07:38.000 --> 07:40.583
and I'll finally have my proof.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.250
That is awesome!

07:42.291 --> 07:44.667
Hey, you can come with me,

07:42.291 --> 07:44.667
Cody. All of you.

07:44.709 --> 07:48.000
A once-in-a-lifetime journey to

07:44.709 --> 07:48.000
the center of the Earth.

07:48.041 --> 07:49.834
Oh, wow...

07:48.041 --> 07:49.834
Sign me up!

07:49.875 --> 07:52.083
Sounds great!

07:49.875 --> 07:52.083
Woodrow...

07:52.125 --> 07:54.250
My family can't just drop

07:52.125 --> 07:54.250
everything and go off

07:54.291 --> 07:56.458
on some spur-of-the moment

07:54.291 --> 07:56.458
expedition.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.375
Especially--

07:58.417 --> 08:00.917
Especially with me,

07:58.417 --> 08:00.917
right?

08:00.959 --> 08:03.333
Give us a minute,

08:00.959 --> 08:03.333
will you, kids?

08:06.500 --> 08:09.583
You've always been the dreamer

08:06.500 --> 08:09.583
of the family, I get that.

08:09.625 --> 08:11.500
But you never

08:09.625 --> 08:11.500
see one dream through

08:11.542 --> 08:13.041
before you're off,

08:11.542 --> 08:13.041
chasing another.

08:13.083 --> 08:14.375
Charlie,

08:13.083 --> 08:14.375
that's not--

08:14.417 --> 08:15.917
Like when we were kids,

08:15.959 --> 08:17.625
I'd have to put out

08:15.959 --> 08:17.625
the fires you started

08:17.667 --> 08:19.709
with your bottle rockets,

08:17.667 --> 08:19.709
and you'd already be off

08:19.750 --> 08:21.500
building a flying bicycle.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.000
Well not all of my expeditions

08:21.542 --> 08:24.000
have gone well,

08:24.041 --> 08:26.000
I'll give you that.

08:24.041 --> 08:26.000
But this time,

08:26.041 --> 08:28.000
with you and the kids along

08:26.041 --> 08:28.000
to keep me focused--

08:28.041 --> 08:29.959
We're not going,

08:28.041 --> 08:29.959
Woodrow.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.375
And you can't borrow

08:30.000 --> 08:32.375
the Tunnel Forger.

08:32.417 --> 08:33.750
That's the end of it.

08:35.375 --> 08:36.375
Sorry, kids.

08:36.417 --> 08:37.417
( button beeps )

08:37.458 --> 08:39.000
( buzzing )

08:41.709 --> 08:45.583
The human sibling relationship

08:41.709 --> 08:45.583
appears to be a complex one.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.792
Don't Bots

08:45.625 --> 08:47.792
have brothers or sisters?

08:47.834 --> 08:50.667
Nope.

08:47.834 --> 08:50.667
We're all on our own.

08:50.709 --> 08:52.375
Lucky.

08:52.417 --> 08:54.709
But it must

08:52.417 --> 08:54.709
get kind of lonely.

08:57.458 --> 09:00.750
HEATWAVE:

08:57.458 --> 09:00.750
There. I wasn't sure at first,

08:57.458 --> 09:00.750
but--

09:00.792 --> 09:02.917
OPTIMUS:

09:00.792 --> 09:02.917
You were right to contact me,

09:00.792 --> 09:02.917
Heatwave.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.625
So that blue crystal is...

09:04.667 --> 09:07.333
Energon. A new supply

09:04.667 --> 09:07.333
that could benefit

09:07.375 --> 09:09.917
all Autobots

09:07.375 --> 09:09.917
for years to come.

09:09.959 --> 09:13.083
Heatwave,

09:09.959 --> 09:13.083
prepare your team.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.625
I will be arriving in the

09:13.125 --> 09:15.625
morning...

09:15.667 --> 09:17.041
And then,

09:17.083 --> 09:18.875
we go underground.

09:22.709 --> 09:24.500
( grease sizzling )

09:26.500 --> 09:28.250
Dad, where's

09:26.500 --> 09:28.250
Uncle Woodrow?

09:28.291 --> 09:30.750
Must've gone out early.

09:28.291 --> 09:30.750
Who knows where.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.333
I might have an idea.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.667
Looks like you were right,

09:41.250 --> 09:42.667
Cody.

09:42.709 --> 09:44.000
Wait here, okay,

09:42.709 --> 09:44.000
Boulder?

09:44.041 --> 09:45.792
(  action theme plays  )

09:45.834 --> 09:47.166
Uncle Woodrow!

09:49.333 --> 09:51.291
Uncle Woodrow,

09:49.333 --> 09:51.291
what are you doing?

09:51.333 --> 09:53.625
Well, I recharged

09:51.333 --> 09:53.625
the power cells...

09:53.667 --> 09:57.125
Now I just have to enter the

09:53.667 --> 09:57.125
coordinates for the cavern,

09:57.166 --> 09:59.333
and the Forger can start

09:57.166 --> 09:59.333
digging.

09:59.375 --> 10:02.375
But my dad--

09:59.375 --> 10:02.375
Your dad thinks my expeditions

10:02.417 --> 10:05.166
are hare-brained. That I

10:02.417 --> 10:05.166
don't think things through.

10:05.208 --> 10:08.250
No offense, Uncle Woodrow,

10:05.208 --> 10:08.250
but I'm not sure

10:08.291 --> 10:10.917
that stealing the Forger is the

10:08.291 --> 10:10.917
best way to prove him wrong.

10:10.959 --> 10:12.250
( laughs )

10:12.291 --> 10:14.208
You're probably right,

10:12.291 --> 10:14.208
Cody.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.041
But you have

10:14.250 --> 10:16.041
big brothers.

10:16.083 --> 10:20.208
You know how a nod from them is

10:16.083 --> 10:20.208
the nicest feeling in the world.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.417
I just want to show

10:20.250 --> 10:22.417
your dad that...

10:22.458 --> 10:24.875
I'm capable of doing something

10:22.458 --> 10:24.875
he can be proud of.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.250
( beeping )

10:27.291 --> 10:28.625
( engine powers up )

10:28.667 --> 10:29.625
( electricity flares )

10:29.667 --> 10:30.959
What's happening?

10:33.959 --> 10:36.166
The cells must have surged.

10:36.208 --> 10:37.542
We're on auto-pilot!

10:41.375 --> 10:42.667
What?

10:42.709 --> 10:44.000
CODY:

10:42.709 --> 10:44.000
Robot,

10:42.709 --> 10:44.000
get us out!

10:46.709 --> 10:48.417
( grunts )

10:51.709 --> 10:53.166
( exclaiming )

10:57.166 --> 10:59.500
70 miles per hour,

10:57.166 --> 10:59.500
at a 40 degree angle...

10:59.542 --> 11:01.041
no way I'll catch them.

11:01.083 --> 11:03.208
( into com-link ):

11:01.083 --> 11:03.208
Graham? Come in, Graham!

11:04.250 --> 11:06.041
(  dramatic theme plays  )

11:12.792 --> 11:14.000
Wha--? Ah!

11:14.041 --> 11:16.375

( sighs of relief )

11:28.542 --> 11:30.875
(  solemn theme plays  )

11:42.625 --> 11:45.458
Since when does Optimus

11:42.625 --> 11:45.458
have a caboose?

11:47.709 --> 11:49.000
Greetings,

11:47.709 --> 11:49.000
Rescue Bots.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.709
Nice rig.

11:50.750 --> 11:54.583
The Transport is for carrying

11:50.750 --> 11:54.583
Energon to the surface,

11:54.625 --> 11:58.291
once the Rescue Bots and I

11:54.625 --> 11:58.291
harvest it from underground.

11:58.333 --> 12:00.583
We'd like to help you

11:58.333 --> 12:00.583
if we can.

12:00.625 --> 12:04.208
I do not wish to endanger

12:00.625 --> 12:04.208
your family, Chief.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.667
Great. Yet another trip to the

12:04.250 --> 12:06.667
center of the Earth

12:06.709 --> 12:08.458
we won't be making.

12:08.500 --> 12:12.041
But we will require the

12:08.500 --> 12:12.041
coordinates your brother found.

12:12.083 --> 12:14.417
Yeah...

12:12.083 --> 12:14.417
A bit of a problem.

12:14.458 --> 12:16.959
Woodrow's kind of...

12:14.458 --> 12:16.959
disappeared.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.417
BOULDER:

12:17.000 --> 12:18.417
Heatwave! Chief!

12:19.667 --> 12:22.041
Optimus,

12:19.667 --> 12:22.041
thank goodness.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.583
Chief,

12:22.083 --> 12:24.583
Cody and your brother...

12:24.625 --> 12:26.875
The Forger took off tunneling,

12:24.625 --> 12:26.875
with them inside!

12:26.917 --> 12:28.208
Then let's roll to the--

12:28.250 --> 12:29.542
We'd never reach it,

12:28.250 --> 12:29.542
Heatwave.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.000
It has too much

12:29.583 --> 12:31.000
of a head start.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.291
It appears our

12:31.041 --> 12:34.291
mining expedition is now

12:34.333 --> 12:35.959
a rescue mission.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.083
For the entire team.

12:39.542 --> 12:41.709
Rescue Bots...

12:39.542 --> 12:41.709
vehicle mode,

12:41.750 --> 12:43.834
then on to my transport.

12:43.875 --> 12:46.917
No offense, Optimus,

12:43.875 --> 12:46.917
but how can you pulling us

12:46.959 --> 12:49.417
on a trailer be any faster

12:46.959 --> 12:49.417
than going ourselves?

12:49.458 --> 12:53.166
Let's just say

12:49.458 --> 12:53.166
there is more to this transport

12:53.208 --> 12:54.875
than meets the eye.

12:55.917 --> 12:57.583
(  heroic theme plays  )

13:05.166 --> 13:07.625
We're nearing the coordinates.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.625
We should be leveling off.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.667
Oh,

13:16.041 --> 13:17.667
the controls aren't working!

13:17.709 --> 13:19.792
( beeping )

13:19.834 --> 13:22.583
My brothers are always telling

13:19.834 --> 13:22.583
me not to press strange buttons,

13:22.625 --> 13:23.917
but I think that might be--

13:23.959 --> 13:25.875
The kill button.

13:23.959 --> 13:25.875
Go for it!

13:30.375 --> 13:32.750
( both yelp )

13:32.792 --> 13:34.959
CODY:

13:32.792 --> 13:34.959
Get out, Uncle Woodrow,

13:32.792 --> 13:34.959
before we're buried.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.750
( struggling )

13:44.291 --> 13:46.417
(  mysterious theme plays  )

13:52.458 --> 13:54.375
(  triumphant theme plays  )

13:54.417 --> 13:56.917
Whoa! Noble!

13:56.959 --> 13:58.000
( laughs )

13:58.041 --> 14:00.458
Whatever that means,

13:58.041 --> 14:00.458
I agree.

14:02.083 --> 14:04.667
This looks like the place your

14:02.083 --> 14:04.667
DES photographed.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.417
Yup.

14:07.458 --> 14:10.583
We're smack dab where we're

14:07.458 --> 14:10.583
supposed to be.

14:10.625 --> 14:11.959
But...

14:12.000 --> 14:13.291
no way back.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.417
My dad will launch a

14:13.333 --> 14:15.417
rescue mission.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.041
He probably already has.

14:17.083 --> 14:20.083
Cody, no one even knows

14:17.083 --> 14:20.083
we're down here.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.875
Who's gonna tell them?

Your bulldozer?

OPTIMUS:

14:28.834 --> 14:30.166
Chief Burns,

14:30.208 --> 14:32.959
I suggest you and your family

14:30.208 --> 14:32.959
hold onto something.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
What?

14:37.083 --> 14:38.625
( all scream )

14:40.625 --> 14:41.917
Is he crazy?

14:41.959 --> 14:44.250
He's Optimus Prime.

14:41.959 --> 14:44.250
Relax.

14:48.709 --> 14:50.166
Statistically speaking,

14:50.208 --> 14:51.792
that maneuver should not

14:50.208 --> 14:51.792
have worked.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.166
Uncle Woodrow,

14:58.542 --> 15:00.166
over here.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.959
Huh...

15:02.000 --> 15:05.959
Must be the tunnel the DES dug

15:02.000 --> 15:05.959
on its exploratory mission.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.542
So it should lead to the

15:06.000 --> 15:08.542
surface, right?

15:08.583 --> 15:11.583
Even if we could reach it,

15:08.583 --> 15:11.583
it's too small to fit through.

15:13.417 --> 15:14.750
Wait...

15:16.667 --> 15:18.333
I've seen that before.

15:19.709 --> 15:20.667
( beeps )

15:20.709 --> 15:22.166
The alien housing structure.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.083
Oh,

15:23.166 --> 15:25.083
your dad was right.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.709
It's just

15:25.125 --> 15:27.709
a rock formation.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.417
( echoes )

15:32.083 --> 15:35.000
And there's my alien

15:32.083 --> 15:35.000
communication signal.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.792
Uncle Woodrow,

15:36.834 --> 15:38.834
that doesn't mean

15:36.834 --> 15:38.834
we won't find other proof.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.166
You never know,

15:40.208 --> 15:41.834
there just might be aliens

15:40.208 --> 15:41.834
after all.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.750
( scoffs )

15:41.875 --> 15:43.750
Yeah.

15:43.792 --> 15:46.125
( distant chittering )

15:47.917 --> 15:49.917
They found us!

15:47.917 --> 15:49.917
I told you they would.

15:53.875 --> 15:56.083
I'm not so sure.

15:56.125 --> 15:57.417
( chittering grows louder )

15:57.458 --> 15:59.458
(  theme turns threatening  )

16:04.458 --> 16:06.208
( loud chittering )

16:10.500 --> 16:11.917
( growling )

16:11.959 --> 16:13.458
( rumbling )

16:14.709 --> 16:16.542
(  heroic theme plays  )

16:25.458 --> 16:27.375
( whispers )

16:25.458 --> 16:27.375
Scorpions!

16:27.417 --> 16:28.709
No.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.041
Much worse.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.750
(  dramatic theme plays  )

16:39.166 --> 16:40.583
( grunting and yelping )

16:42.667 --> 16:44.208
That new robot...

16:44.250 --> 16:45.750
Impressive!

16:50.667 --> 16:52.000
( yelps )

16:54.500 --> 16:55.834
Dad!

16:57.458 --> 16:59.375
( Woodrow and Cody struggle )

17:00.417 --> 17:02.417
(  tense theme plays  )

17:12.583 --> 17:14.959
(  triumphant theme plays  )

17:15.000 --> 17:16.458
Herd 'em this way!

17:19.417 --> 17:21.458
( grunting )

17:35.625 --> 17:37.375
(  heroic theme plays  )

17:43.250 --> 17:45.208
Oh, Cody...

17:45.250 --> 17:47.458
What on Earth

17:45.250 --> 17:47.458
were you thinking?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.375
Didn't I tell you--?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.375
It wasn't his fault, Dad.

17:49.417 --> 17:50.709
The Forger just took off and--

17:50.750 --> 17:53.000
No, Cody.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.000
Your dad's right.

17:53.041 --> 17:56.750
It's my fault for sneaking off

17:53.041 --> 17:56.750
on this goose chase.

17:56.792 --> 17:59.458
I put you in danger,

17:56.792 --> 17:59.458
and I'm sorry for that.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.542
Thank you,

17:59.500 --> 18:01.542
Woodrow.

18:01.583 --> 18:02.875
Apology accepted.

18:02.917 --> 18:04.709
The worst part is...

18:04.750 --> 18:07.000
the entire trip was pointless.

18:07.041 --> 18:10.375
No lost civilization,

18:07.041 --> 18:10.375
no signs of alien life.

18:11.417 --> 18:13.125
You're right, Charlie.

18:13.166 --> 18:16.792
I've wasted my whole life just

18:13.166 --> 18:16.792
chasing...shadows.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.750
As soon as we get

18:16.834 --> 18:18.750
to the surface,

18:18.792 --> 18:20.291
I'll head home.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.542
And get out

18:20.333 --> 18:22.542
of your family's hair.

18:22.583 --> 18:24.500
( whispering ):

18:22.583 --> 18:24.500
Why is he talking about hair?

18:24.542 --> 18:27.500
( whispering )

18:24.542 --> 18:27.500
A metaphor. I'll explain later.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.834
But Uncle Woodrow...

18:27.542 --> 18:29.834
what are you going to do?

18:29.875 --> 18:33.083
I'm not sure.

18:29.875 --> 18:33.083
But I have to face it.

18:33.125 --> 18:35.000
Atlantis,

18:33.125 --> 18:35.000
Shangri La...

18:35.041 --> 18:36.500
no such things.

18:36.542 --> 18:38.709
And aliens have never visited

18:36.542 --> 18:38.709
because they don't exist.

18:41.917 --> 18:44.083
What?

18:41.917 --> 18:44.083
He is family, Dad.

18:44.125 --> 18:46.458
You can't let him go on

18:44.125 --> 18:46.458
thinking he's failed.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.834
I mean if it were Kade,

18:46.500 --> 18:48.834
I'd try to cheer him up.

18:48.875 --> 18:50.208
Maybe.

18:50.250 --> 18:51.959
Tell him,

18:50.250 --> 18:51.959
Dad!

18:52.000 --> 18:53.250
Tell me what?

18:57.875 --> 19:00.125
Woodrow...little brother.

19:00.166 --> 19:02.917
I don't know about Shangri-La,

19:00.166 --> 19:02.917
or Atlantis,

19:02.959 --> 19:07.166
but I can tell you as a point of

19:02.959 --> 19:07.166
fact... aliens do exist.

19:07.208 --> 19:08.208
( sighs )

19:08.250 --> 19:10.083
You don't have to do this,

19:08.250 --> 19:10.083
Charlie.

19:10.125 --> 19:11.875
It doesn't make me feel

19:10.125 --> 19:11.875
any better.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.959
Well maybe this will.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.250
Team,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.250
introduce yourselves.

19:16.291 --> 19:18.667
Heatwave.

19:16.291 --> 19:18.667
Pleased to meet you.

19:18.709 --> 19:20.542
My name is Chase.

19:20.583 --> 19:22.792
And I am proud to be your

19:20.583 --> 19:22.792
brother's policing partner.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.458
Boulder.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.792
Blades.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.417
And now that I

19:25.834 --> 19:27.417
can speak freely,

19:27.458 --> 19:30.792
can I just say how terrifying

19:27.458 --> 19:30.792
those spiders were?

19:30.834 --> 19:32.333
Not gonna fall for it.

19:34.834 --> 19:38.959
I am Optimus Prime.

19:34.834 --> 19:38.959
And Chief Burns is correct.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.625
To the people of Earth,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.625
we are aliens.

19:41.667 --> 19:46.041
Our home planet of Cybertron

19:41.667 --> 19:46.041
is most likely unknown to you.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.291
We'd tell you

19:46.083 --> 19:48.291
what galaxy it's in,

19:48.333 --> 19:49.875
but you haven't heard of that,

19:48.333 --> 19:49.875
either.

19:49.917 --> 19:54.333
I was right.

19:49.917 --> 19:54.333
I was right!

19:54.375 --> 19:56.542
( laughs )

19:54.375 --> 19:56.542
I just...I just...

19:56.583 --> 19:58.959
My DES worked,

19:56.583 --> 19:58.959
Charlie...

19:59.000 --> 20:01.208
it found aliens!

20:01.250 --> 20:03.583
I just never figured you'd be

20:01.250 --> 20:03.583
the one hiding them.

20:03.625 --> 20:05.709
So...

20:05.750 --> 20:07.500
you guys...

20:07.542 --> 20:08.792
Cybernites!

20:08.834 --> 20:10.792
Cybertronians.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.583
Right. You've been leaving

20:10.834 --> 20:13.583
artifacts on Earth?

20:13.625 --> 20:14.959
For what,

20:13.625 --> 20:14.959
like centuries?

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
That is a long story,

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
for another day.

20:19.041 --> 20:21.083
Oh, I knew it!

20:21.125 --> 20:24.291
Wow, thanks, Charlie. For

20:21.125 --> 20:24.291
trusting me with your secret.

20:24.333 --> 20:27.458
Like Graham said,

20:24.333 --> 20:27.458
we're all family.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.166
And that's

20:27.500 --> 20:30.166
what family does.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.583
They also do this...

20:32.792 --> 20:34.000
Ha-ha-ha!

20:32.792 --> 20:34.000
Hey!

20:34.041 --> 20:35.709
Stop it, Charlie!

20:35.750 --> 20:39.083
This gesture appears to be

20:35.750 --> 20:39.083
universal in sibling relations.

20:39.125 --> 20:42.208
Let's get to work team.

20:39.125 --> 20:42.208
We have some Energon to harvest.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.000
( rumbling )

20:44.041 --> 20:45.917
(  tense theme plays  )

20:46.709 --> 20:47.667
( all exclaim )

20:47.709 --> 20:48.959
CHIEF:

20:47.709 --> 20:48.959
Everybody,

20:47.709 --> 20:48.959
watch it!

21:05.083 --> 21:06.625
( yells )

21:06.667 --> 21:08.542
( grunting )

21:13.709 --> 21:15.083
CHIEF:

21:13.709 --> 21:15.083
This way!

21:19.375 --> 21:20.667
( both yell )

21:20.709 --> 21:22.000
CODY:

21:20.709 --> 21:22.000
Heatwave!

21:22.041 --> 21:23.709
CHIEF:

21:22.041 --> 21:23.709
Cody, come on!

21:26.542 --> 21:28.458
( both grunting )
