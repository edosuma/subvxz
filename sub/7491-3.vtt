WEBVTT

00:02.750 --> 00:04.792
Six and a half horsepower engine.

00:04.875 --> 00:07.875
Aluminum rims with independent suspension.

00:07.959 --> 00:10.667
Four-wheel servo-drive disc brakes.

00:10.750 --> 00:11.834
It's...

00:12.500 --> 00:13.625
red!

00:15.583 --> 00:16.583
Hey, guys.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.041
Oh!
- Snap!

00:18.125 --> 00:19.875
- Whoa!
- Kim, wow!

00:20.291 --> 00:21.417
You look, uh...

00:21.917 --> 00:22.792
different.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.125
Hot date tonight?

00:24.208 --> 00:25.375
With a clown?

00:26.500 --> 00:28.667
Go ahead and laugh, but I just got us

00:28.750 --> 00:31.041
ten bucks closer to buying that go-cart.

00:31.375 --> 00:32.667
- Oh.
- Wilford Beauty College

00:32.750 --> 00:34.375
is paying people to be
their practice dummy.

00:34.458 --> 00:36.083
My cousin Chewie goes there.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.959
You know, for his final,
he trimmed my grandmother's mustache.

00:39.041 --> 00:41.000
He went through three pairs of scissors,

00:41.083 --> 00:42.625
but he got most of it.

00:43.917 --> 00:46.375
Man, I can't wait
till we get that go-cart.

00:46.417 --> 00:47.792
- Oh, it's gonna be--
- I cannot either.

00:47.875 --> 00:51.208
- I know, it's so awesome.
- Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

00:52.583 --> 00:55.041
All right, time to kick in.

00:55.625 --> 00:58.041
I made 40 bucks by visiting
my great-aunt Betty.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.000
Every time I go, she thinks
it's my birthday and gives me money.

01:01.417 --> 01:03.250
I went four times yesterday.

01:04.709 --> 01:05.792
And I went twice.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.709
Cindy Connors gave me ten bucks

01:09.792 --> 01:11.792
to stop asking her out
in front of her boyfriend.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.917
Someone put an IOU in here.

01:16.375 --> 01:19.417
"Took five bucks to buy a foot-long
at Captain Corndog's.

01:19.792 --> 01:22.834
It's dope, yo. Whoo!"

01:23.875 --> 01:25.500
Who would do something like that?

01:27.333 --> 01:28.834
Dude, come on, Jerry.

01:28.917 --> 01:32.166
You're the only one who hasn't contributed
to the go-cart fund.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.834
I don't have the talent to make money.

01:33.917 --> 01:35.959
I even tried selling doors, door-to-door.

01:36.041 --> 01:38.208
You know how hard it is
to find a house without a door?

01:40.417 --> 01:43.583
You guys are never gonna guess
how I just made ten dollars.

01:44.750 --> 01:48.417
Uh, practice dummy
at the Wilford Beauty College?

01:48.792 --> 01:50.458
No, I sold my old golf shoes.

01:50.959 --> 01:52.458
What's this about a beauty college?

01:55.333 --> 01:58.583

02:39.083 --> 02:41.250
Hey, Rudy, can I talk to you for a sec?

02:41.333 --> 02:42.625
Yeah, absolutely.

02:44.166 --> 02:45.333
<i>What's going on, Eddie?</i>

02:45.417 --> 02:47.375
Anything I say is
between you and me, right?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.625
I'm your sensei.
Whatever you told me stays between us.

02:51.166 --> 02:53.959
I got a pretzel from Mr. Nelson
in the food court the other day,

02:54.417 --> 02:55.917
and I'm not sure I paid for it.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.834
Well, I can tell you right now
that you didn't.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.041
- I didn't?
- No.

03:00.375 --> 03:01.959
You obviously have a guilty conscience.

03:02.041 --> 03:04.792
It's eating you up!
Eddie, we've gotta fix this.

03:05.792 --> 03:07.083
Sorry, guys, I gotta go.

03:07.166 --> 03:10.291
Gotta save Eddie from
a lifetime of crime and incarceration.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.750
Dead man walking!

03:17.709 --> 03:20.417
Another ten bucks towards the go-cart.

03:20.875 --> 03:22.792
Has, um, Jerry put any money in yet?

03:23.166 --> 03:25.041
I haven't seen Jerry in two days.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.750
Ah, guys, we were pretty rough on him.

03:26.834 --> 03:29.542
He's probably embarrassed
he can't kick in enough for the go-cart.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.917
Oh, hey, you guys. You like my new ride?

03:50.709 --> 03:52.625
You bought our go-cart?

03:52.709 --> 03:53.750
Yeah.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.041
I, uh, I decided to go solo.

03:57.542 --> 04:00.083
Two days ago, you couldn't
go solo on a gumball.

04:01.125 --> 04:03.000
Well, that was before I got a job
delivering meatballs

04:03.083 --> 04:04.375
for the Meatball King.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.417
- Gotta take this.
-

04:08.625 --> 04:10.417
- Hello?
-

04:10.458 --> 04:12.542
Oh, yeah, yeah. I told you three times.

04:12.625 --> 04:14.709
I delivered the thing
to the guy at the place.

04:15.458 --> 04:16.750
Okay, okay.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.834
You know what, doll?
Why don't you go get yourself fixed up.

04:21.709 --> 04:22.875
- That's it.
- Wait--

04:22.959 --> 04:25.208
- No, no, no!
- Hey, hey, hey. Whoo!

04:38.667 --> 04:43.125
I really want to be mad at him,
but he looks so cool.

04:47.709 --> 04:49.583
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

04:50.250 --> 04:52.375
Eddie, you're doing the right thing.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.458
By telling the truth,

04:53.542 --> 04:55.583
you're learning the lesson
that crime doesn't pay.

04:55.667 --> 04:56.500
Okay.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.792
Mr. Nelson,

05:00.625 --> 05:03.583
I took a pretzel yesterday
and I don't think I paid for it.

05:03.667 --> 05:06.166
You sweet, sweet, brave boy.

05:06.250 --> 05:07.375
Here's five dollars.

05:07.458 --> 05:09.917
What? Uh, what are you doing?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I'm trying to teach him the lesson
that crime doesn't pay,

05:12.083 --> 05:13.750
and you are literally paying him!

05:14.792 --> 05:16.125
Well, I'm trying to teach him

05:16.208 --> 05:18.375
that if you're honest and tell the truth,

05:18.458 --> 05:20.000
you should be rewarded.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.917
Not after stealing.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.792
The truth conquers all, little man.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.458
Oh.

05:26.542 --> 05:28.792
Oh, okay, I, I, guess
if we're telling the truth here,

05:28.875 --> 05:30.458
then I thought maybe
you would like to know

05:30.542 --> 05:32.917
that everyone in the mall thinks
your pretzels are harder

05:33.000 --> 05:34.458
than your little wooden shoes.

05:37.500 --> 05:41.375
How dare you! You heissenphasser!

05:45.834 --> 05:47.458
He just sucker-pretzeled me!

05:47.542 --> 05:49.291
It's okay, Rudy. Let it go.

05:52.625 --> 05:56.083
I still cannot believe
that Jerry bought our go-cart.

05:56.417 --> 05:58.166
This goes way beyond the go-cart.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.083
Ever since he started working
for the Meatball King,

06:00.166 --> 06:01.667
he's been a whole different person.

06:01.750 --> 06:04.667
If he calls me "doll" one more time,
I'm gonna pummel him!

06:06.125 --> 06:08.208
Okay, two falafels for you.

06:08.291 --> 06:09.959
Oh-ho! Holy ghanoush!

06:10.375 --> 06:12.917
I know, Phil. My hair looks hideous.

06:13.375 --> 06:15.583
I can fix this. I've seen worse.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.667
Do you mind if my hands dance
with your "harr"?

06:22.041 --> 06:24.583
Phil, do you even know
anything about "harr"?

06:24.667 --> 06:27.291
Don't you worry, baby.
I know what I'm doing.

06:27.417 --> 06:29.583
I'm frosting Tootsie's tips as we speak.

06:34.250 --> 06:36.375
No, Tootsie, you're not ready yet!

06:36.458 --> 06:38.583
Five more minutes. Back under the lamps.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.250
<i>Go. Go, go, go, go.</i>

06:47.750 --> 06:49.417
- Phil, you've got a customer.
<i>Oh.</i>

06:50.542 --> 06:52.667
Uh, hello, Mr. Dirk.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.625
What bring you around to the town?

06:55.375 --> 06:56.875
It's time to pay your bill.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.917
Uh, but... Please, I need more time.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.083
No, you're out of time
and I ain't playin' games.

07:01.166 --> 07:02.667
Games? I love playing games.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.959
Let's play hiding and the seeking.
I'm going to hide and you--

07:05.041 --> 07:06.750
All right, that's it.

07:09.291 --> 07:11.291
You probably shouldn't have done that.

07:19.291 --> 07:20.709
Phil, who was that guy?

07:20.792 --> 07:22.417
He collect the money for the meatballs

07:22.500 --> 07:24.625
that I do not need,
but I am forced to buy.

07:24.709 --> 07:26.583
- From who?
- The Meatball King.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.667
- The Meatball King?
-

07:28.750 --> 07:30.083
That's Jerry's boss!

07:31.542 --> 07:33.333
Oh, great, Tootsie.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.917
Now, why would such
a good little goat eat her tips?

07:38.291 --> 07:39.750
And her timer?

07:45.750 --> 07:47.834
So do you think you can help
teach Eddie a lesson?

07:47.917 --> 07:50.291
You know, I'm not even
a hundred percent sure I actually--

07:50.417 --> 07:51.583
Shut it, punk!

07:52.291 --> 07:54.083
Don't you worry, Rudy.

07:54.166 --> 07:57.208
The next time you see this one,
he'll be what we call...

07:57.291 --> 07:59.750
scared straight!

08:07.375 --> 08:11.625
So, Jerry, tell the Meatball King
everything you know about Falafel Phil.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.041
Okay, let's see. Phil--

08:14.125 --> 08:16.959
Uh, really weird accent,
I think he's from Minnesota.

08:18.375 --> 08:20.458
Uh, he loves Tootsie. Oh,.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.959
And on his left foot... it's all big toes.

08:26.417 --> 08:28.375
Whoa, go back.

08:28.458 --> 08:29.917
Who's this "Tootsie"?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.959
Oh, his goat. They're tight, yo. Whoo.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.417
You hear that, Dirk?

08:36.291 --> 08:39.291
Phil loves his goat.

08:39.875 --> 08:43.291
Hearing about Phil gives me the courage
to confess my dirty little secret.

08:44.542 --> 08:45.750
My left foot...

08:49.458 --> 08:50.625
is a hand.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.792
Oh.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.250
The twitching stopped.

09:04.625 --> 09:07.291
And I think the swelling
is finally starting to go down.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.417
How's it look?

09:13.583 --> 09:16.291
Yeah. Maybe a couple more minutes.

09:17.959 --> 09:20.417
- Is Jerry in here?
- Yeah, he's in the locker room.

09:23.041 --> 09:26.542
- Um, what are you wearing?
- A custom-made gi.

09:26.625 --> 09:28.750
My new boss got it for me. Check it.

09:30.250 --> 09:31.834
Whoo-ho-ho!

09:32.375 --> 09:35.208
That is the tackiest gi I've ever seen.

09:35.291 --> 09:37.375
I mean, where would one even go
to buy such a thing?

09:37.458 --> 09:38.875
In a medium?

09:39.875 --> 09:43.250
Jerry, your new boss
is forcing people to buy meatballs.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.583
He's a criminal.

09:46.583 --> 09:47.917
Sure he is.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.208
You know what?

09:49.291 --> 09:50.917
You guys are just jealous
'cause I've got--

09:51.000 --> 09:52.875
The Meatball King stole Tootsie!

09:52.959 --> 09:54.083
- What? What?
- What?

09:54.166 --> 09:55.166
What?

09:55.959 --> 09:59.250
"Give me my money, or the goat gets it.

09:59.875 --> 10:01.291
The Meatball King."

10:02.208 --> 10:04.083
Well, that doesn't prove anything.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.125
You know how many Meatball Kings
there are in the world?

10:06.792 --> 10:08.166
He took Tootsie!

10:09.458 --> 10:11.333
- You know how many Tootsies there are--
- Jerry!

10:11.417 --> 10:13.000
I get it. I'm working for a criminal!

10:18.417 --> 10:21.250
Oh, I gotta get one of those gis.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.750
Uh, that's right, officer.
Tootsie is a goat. Mm-hmm.

10:28.625 --> 10:30.542
Oh. Okay then, thanks.

10:30.625 --> 10:31.667
Take care.

10:32.208 --> 10:34.375
Yeah, uh, they're not gonna help us.

10:35.625 --> 10:39.083
I'll never see my Tootsie ever again.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.875
It's okay, Phil,
let's look at her photo album again.

10:42.959 --> 10:44.375
Yeah? Okay.

10:45.542 --> 10:48.375
Oh, this is my favorite.

10:48.458 --> 10:50.542
It's from her Baah Mitzvah.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.000
Man, this is all my fault.

10:54.375 --> 10:56.875
I just saw an opportunity to make
some really good money,

10:56.959 --> 10:58.667
I didn't realize what I was doing.

10:59.208 --> 11:02.458
Oh, okay. I must figure out a way
to pay this ransom.

11:02.542 --> 11:03.709
And then what?

11:04.250 --> 11:07.458
You'll be back to overpaying for meatballs
that you don't need.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.959
Guys, we have to stop him.

11:10.041 --> 11:11.125
But how?

11:11.208 --> 11:14.125
Yeah. It's not like I can just
stick my phone onto my chest,

11:14.208 --> 11:17.000
go into the Meatball King's office,
record his confession,

11:17.083 --> 11:19.250
then take the evidence
to the police department.

11:19.917 --> 11:21.291
You guys really think this'll work?

11:22.583 --> 11:23.709
Absolutely.

11:23.792 --> 11:25.875
We'll record the whole confession here
at the dojo.

11:26.291 --> 11:27.208
Got it.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.041
Cindy Meyers.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.959
- Gotta take this.

11:44.834 --> 11:45.959
Take a look around.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.375
It's a little cramped.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.083
Oh, you think it's cramped now?

11:54.750 --> 11:56.792
Wait till you meet your cellmate.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.834
What's up, fresh meat?

12:10.917 --> 12:12.625
I'm Norma.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.875
Let me give you
a little survival tip, huh?

12:16.959 --> 12:19.125
When we get down to the mess hall,

12:19.208 --> 12:21.583
if Gert asks for your oyster crackers,

12:21.667 --> 12:24.583
take it from me, give 'em up.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.959
Um, Joan?

12:29.041 --> 12:30.709
Joan ain't here.

12:34.083 --> 12:35.375
Well, when you see her,

12:35.458 --> 12:37.625
tell her she tossed the keys out
with her uniform.

12:37.709 --> 12:39.667
Oh, when I see her, I certainly--

12:40.041 --> 12:41.625
Holy Hanna!

12:49.500 --> 12:50.750
It's gonna be a few minutes.

12:50.834 --> 12:53.041
The Meatball King's on the phone
with the big boss,

12:53.125 --> 12:54.333
the Schnoz.

12:56.542 --> 12:59.291
Schnoz? That's a funny name, man.

13:00.166 --> 13:03.000
Hey, how come I've never seen the Schnoz?

13:03.083 --> 13:04.500
'Cause no one's ever seen him.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.208
All we know is he's got a big nose
that covers half his mustache.

13:07.291 --> 13:10.667
And the only time he shows up
is when it's your time to go.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.500
Go where?

13:14.959 --> 13:16.917
You know, "go."

13:19.542 --> 13:21.625
Oh, I'm sorry, I still don't know
where anyone's going.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.000
<i>Okay, boss.</i>
-

13:27.917 --> 13:29.041
He'll see you now.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.041
Okay, I'm going in.

13:39.083 --> 13:41.375
<i>What do you want to see me
about, Jerry? I'm busy.</i>

13:41.625 --> 13:44.291
<i>Uh, well, you know, I was, uh...</i>

13:44.375 --> 13:46.125
I was just in the neighborhood
and I was wondering

13:46.208 --> 13:48.542
what your thoughts are on, you know,
crime and all the other stuff,

13:48.625 --> 13:50.750
particularly vis-à-vis, uh,
you know, goat stealing.

13:50.834 --> 13:53.166
And before you answer,
can you please state your full name?

13:55.458 --> 13:57.375
Jerry, I don't have
a lot of time for this.

13:57.458 --> 13:58.959
Is there a reason why you're here?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.250
Yeah, there is, King.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.041
I know you goat-napped Tootsie

14:05.125 --> 14:06.917
and I was the one who told you about her.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.291
- I want a piece of the action!
-

14:10.250 --> 14:12.458
Oh, no! We got disconnected.

14:12.583 --> 14:14.166
What we should do?

14:16.542 --> 14:17.709
Call him back?

14:18.417 --> 14:20.417
- Yeah, yeah.
- Call him back, call him back.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.750
She's so smart!

14:23.333 --> 14:24.917
So there you have it.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.250
Every detail of my life of crime.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.291
- Something wrong, Jerry?
- Huh?

14:33.375 --> 14:34.458
Oh, no, no, everything's fine.

14:37.041 --> 14:38.291
Where's that coming from?

14:38.375 --> 14:39.959
My... my... my soul.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.125
Is it just me or is it getting
a little hot in here, right?

14:53.417 --> 14:55.500
Whoa! Whoo!

14:57.417 --> 14:59.208
- Whoo!
- You okay, Jerry?

14:59.291 --> 15:00.250
Huh? Oh, no, yeah.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.083
You know, sometimes a man's just gotta...

15:02.166 --> 15:04.375
-
- ...dance!

15:04.458 --> 15:07.125
Oh, whoo! I think I need to go to a...

15:08.625 --> 15:09.959
...club!

15:10.500 --> 15:12.750
So I can get. You know, get my groove...

15:12.834 --> 15:14.375
-
- On!

15:15.542 --> 15:18.000
You know what? Great talk.
I gotta go, man.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.000
Whoo!

15:21.625 --> 15:23.417
Good kid, but he's got a lot of issues.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.041
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

15:28.125 --> 15:30.291
Check your pockets and see
if there's anything I can eat.

15:32.750 --> 15:35.208
I don't have anything but this receipt.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.667
From the pretzel kiosk!

15:39.000 --> 15:40.542
Okay, I'll take it. I'll take it.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.208
You know what this means?

15:44.291 --> 15:45.917
I'm an innocent man!

15:46.417 --> 15:49.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, we're all innocent.

15:49.083 --> 15:50.917
We gotta bust out of here, Eddie.

15:51.208 --> 15:52.375
You know what?

15:52.458 --> 15:54.667
I'm gonna do something I saw
in a cartoon once.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.709
I'm going to pick that lock
with my tongue.

16:04.375 --> 16:06.291
Joan, the air vent!

16:07.000 --> 16:09.166
Oh. Oh, the air vent.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.709
Yeah, well, that might work. I don't know.

16:12.208 --> 16:15.291
Let me take a look. See, here... Uh...

16:16.709 --> 16:19.291
Freedom!

16:27.500 --> 16:30.417
What I don't understand is
why you're covered in suds.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.333
Well, just before I almost
burst into flames,

16:33.417 --> 16:36.250
I ran through the car wash,
where I realized two things.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.500
One, you know that blow-dryer at the end?

16:38.583 --> 16:40.750
It can literally blow your freckles off.

16:42.125 --> 16:45.375
And two, the Meatball King was talking
to his boss on the phone today,

16:45.417 --> 16:46.959
and he was scared to death with him.

16:47.542 --> 16:49.000
How does that help us?

16:49.083 --> 16:52.375
Well, he's never seen the guy.
They call him the Schnoz.

16:52.458 --> 16:54.000
Why do they call him that?

16:54.083 --> 16:56.417
Because he's got
one gnarly-looking honker.

17:04.959 --> 17:05.959
What?

17:17.041 --> 17:19.375
Glad to see you came to your senses.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.333
You got my money?

17:22.583 --> 17:24.083
You got my goat?

17:24.583 --> 17:25.959
Can't you can see she's right there?

17:27.709 --> 17:30.375
Jerry? Shouldn't you be making a delivery?

17:30.959 --> 17:32.375
I'm done with deliveries.

17:32.917 --> 17:33.917
When I took a job with you,

17:34.000 --> 17:35.500
I didn't know
what kind of person you were.

17:35.875 --> 17:36.959
But I do now.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.959
What are you doing here with goat boy?

17:40.709 --> 17:42.083
Goat boy's a friend of mine.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.333
In fact, he's got lots of friends.

17:44.792 --> 17:46.291
Some you might even know.

17:46.375 --> 17:47.875
Oh, yeah? Like who?

17:48.417 --> 17:49.959
The Schnoz.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.667
I would have been here earlier,

17:54.125 --> 17:56.208
but I got lost in all this fog.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.208
I swear on my mama's meatballs.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.375
If I knew Phil was a friend of yours,

18:01.458 --> 18:03.083
I would have never disrespected him.

18:03.709 --> 18:05.125
Dirk, give 'em the goat.

18:09.333 --> 18:12.583
Tootsie, welcome back to the family.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.875
<i>Let's go, Tootsie.</i>
-

18:19.250 --> 18:21.250
You don't know how lucky you are,

18:21.291 --> 18:23.208
that not a hair on Tootsie's--

18:23.291 --> 18:24.834
The goat ate my fake mustache, didn't it?

18:24.917 --> 18:25.917
Yeah.

19:11.125 --> 19:12.083
Ooh.

19:13.917 --> 19:14.959
Rudy!

19:15.458 --> 19:17.125
Meatball bazooka!

19:21.333 --> 19:22.333
Rudy!

19:43.250 --> 19:44.667
You wouldn't... Okay.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.250
<i>Freedom!</i>

19:52.375 --> 19:54.417
This is where we go our separate ways.

19:54.792 --> 19:55.750
Good luck, kid.

19:56.625 --> 19:57.834
Bye, Norma!

19:59.834 --> 20:01.458
I can't believe you did this to me, Jerry!

20:01.959 --> 20:04.792
I treated you like a son.
You were like family.

20:06.375 --> 20:07.625
You're not my family.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.208
These people are my family.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.500
All I know is your family's crazy!

20:13.041 --> 20:14.375
Let's get out of here, guys.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.917
Oh, Rudy, I found my receipt.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.458
I did pay for that pretzel.

20:20.542 --> 20:21.583
Oh, really? Let's see it.

20:21.667 --> 20:23.709
Oh, I don't have it. Joan ate it.

20:23.792 --> 20:25.291
Here we go.

20:25.417 --> 20:27.542
First you steal and now you're lying.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.834
I've got a guy that deals with liars.

20:29.917 --> 20:32.000
What are you talking about? I mean...

20:32.250 --> 20:34.333
I just want to say how sorry I am.

20:34.417 --> 20:36.166
I let the whole job thing get to my head

20:36.250 --> 20:38.250
and money should never be
more important than friendship.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.500
You're right. But in the end,

20:40.583 --> 20:42.125
you were the one who came up with the plan

20:42.208 --> 20:44.333
to get Tootsie back and it all worked out.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.667
And on top of that
you got yourself a go-cart.

20:46.750 --> 20:49.875
No, we got a go-cart.

20:49.959 --> 20:51.667
- No way, dude!
- Yes.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.709
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

20:53.792 --> 20:56.375

21:01.375 --> 21:04.000
Oh. Oh, hello, officer.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.917
You're probably wondering
why I was speeding,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.959
wearing a prison jumpsuit,
and driving a tiny stolen car.

21:12.333 --> 21:16.250
Well, I should tell you that
I left my drivers' license on the floor

21:16.375 --> 21:18.417
just outside the jail cell I broke out of.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.250
Whoa! Whoa! Easy there, big fella.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.542
Hey... Oh, is that your
motorcycle back there?

21:23.625 --> 21:25.542
Uh, I think you have a flat tire.

21:29.083 --> 21:30.333
Should have gassed up.
