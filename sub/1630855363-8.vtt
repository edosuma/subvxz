You alright?

00:53.824 --> 00:55.261
Yeah.

00:55.294 --> 00:56.730
I’m alright.

00:56.763 --> 00:58.032
CLAIRE:
Everything's fine.

00:59.669 --> 01:00.938
(exhales)

01:00.971 --> 01:02.374
So what's today?

01:03.377 --> 01:07.886
Um, NICET exam. Level 2.

01:07.919 --> 01:09.856
CLAIRE:
That sounds really serious.

01:09.889 --> 01:11.159
Yeah, it's boss level.

01:13.764 --> 01:14.899
Hey.

01:16.136 --> 01:17.205
CARMY: Hi.

01:17.238 --> 01:18.907
(whispering)
What’s NICET Level 2?

01:19.843 --> 01:22.948
Uh, NICET Level 2,
it's a fire suppression exam.

01:23.316 --> 01:27.892
Um, it pretty much, it has
to go right above the... stove.

01:32.068 --> 01:33.103
What?

01:37.979 --> 01:40.016
I'm really sorry.
I just, like, um...

01:40.050 --> 01:41.986
Never ever apologize.

01:43.457 --> 01:45.428
CARMY: I just
want you to know...

01:45.461 --> 01:47.231
that this is really nice.

01:51.506 --> 01:54.145
So nice that, I, uh...

01:54.178 --> 01:56.115
You're waiting
for the other shoe.

01:58.019 --> 01:59.456
That's it.

01:59.489 --> 02:01.359
-You wanna know a secret?
-CARMY: Yes.

02:02.495 --> 02:04.398
Nobody's keeping track of shoes.

02:08.941 --> 02:10.344
Whoa.

02:10.377 --> 02:11.679
I know!

02:12.581 --> 02:16.723
Okay, so the...
system is above the stove?

02:16.756 --> 02:18.394
-The system is above the stove.
-CLAIRE: Mm-hmm.

02:18.427 --> 02:20.464
And, um, you know,
it-it has to go off

02:20.497 --> 02:23.304
if something catches fire,
that could get outta control.

02:23.337 --> 02:25.308
-So above Richie? Hm-mm?
-Yes.

02:25.341 --> 02:27.078
So Fak would be holding it

02:27.111 --> 02:29.816
and Richie
spontaneously combusts,

02:29.849 --> 02:31.018
there's fire everywhere,

02:31.052 --> 02:33.357
the suppression system
shuts off the gas line,

02:33.390 --> 02:34.793
and it would spray him

02:34.826 --> 02:37.431
with a sodium potassium
bicarbonate solution.

02:38.267 --> 02:40.972
And then we-we put this,
uh, balloon on the line

02:41.005 --> 02:43.444
and if the balloon fills up--

02:43.477 --> 02:44.980
If it leaks, you fail.

02:45.013 --> 02:48.354
If it leaks, we fail,
and if it doesn't--

02:48.387 --> 02:50.091
You've achieved Level 2.

02:50.124 --> 02:52.128
-Wow. You've done it.
-We've done it.

02:52.161 --> 02:53.330
Yeah.

02:54.799 --> 02:55.901
Um...

02:57.805 --> 02:59.409
Can I ask you a question?

02:59.442 --> 03:00.510
CLAIRE: Mm-hmm.

03:01.379 --> 03:05.187
Is this just the most
boring shit
you've ever heard?

03:05.220 --> 03:07.091
-No, it's so interesting.
-Is it?

03:07.124 --> 03:08.494
CLAIRE: How often
do you get to talk about

03:08.527 --> 03:10.264
sodium potassium bicarbonate?

03:10.297 --> 03:12.302
Um, probably about as often

03:12.335 --> 03:14.805
as you hope
a balloon doesn't blow up.

03:18.347 --> 03:20.050
Anything else you're thinking?

03:25.026 --> 03:26.963
I'm thinking
you're very, very beautiful.

03:34.545 --> 03:37.851
Well... break a leg, Bear.

I was looking for some old,

I'm Tina.

05:11.339 --> 05:13.042
How can I help you?

05:13.743 --> 05:16.048
This used to be
a good restaurant here.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.155
What happened to it?

05:19.188 --> 05:20.624
TINA:
Well, they had to close.

05:20.657 --> 05:23.931
I heard there were too many
old bitches working here

05:23.964 --> 05:25.501
couldn't hack it.

Maybe they don't want

Maybe they get scared.

05:42.535 --> 05:43.937
Afraid.

05:43.970 --> 05:46.309
Yeah. Makes sense.

05:46.342 --> 05:49.382
That's how an old bitch
would think.

05:49.415 --> 05:52.155
But that's why
they surround themselves

05:52.188 --> 05:55.260
with bad motherfuckers
who take care of them.

05:56.329 --> 05:57.564
Push their ass.

06:01.506 --> 06:03.076
This a drive-through now?

06:03.109 --> 06:06.283
Yeah, well, they wanted
to sell OG through here,

06:06.316 --> 06:09.321
but they're having
a really hard time hiring.

06:09.822 --> 06:12.261

No, too many hustlers.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.436
They all wanna be Top Jeff.

really looking for
is a stubborn, childish,

06:22.214 --> 06:27.224
immature, pain-in-the-ass...
with arthritis

06:27.825 --> 06:29.695

Fire suppression test. You?

SYDNEY:
Controlling the zone,

07:01.092 --> 07:04.030
staying calm,
creating space, trust.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.136
How do we do that?

07:06.169 --> 07:08.307
I don't know.
It's hard to without a gas line.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.709
Right.

07:09.742 --> 07:11.313
When's that guy coming in?
N... Never mind.

07:11.346 --> 07:13.450
That's a stupid
fuckin' question.

07:13.483 --> 07:15.054
Deliveries come
in five minutes,

07:15.087 --> 07:16.556
we got new hires in an hour,

07:16.589 --> 07:18.327
and we're two weeks out
from open.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.762
If we fail this next test,

07:19.795 --> 07:21.099
-we're fucked.
-We are fucked.

07:21.132 --> 07:22.602
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

07:25.641 --> 07:27.444

Book?

07:30.284 --> 07:31.653

Book, yeah.

07:31.686 --> 07:33.323
We can do that, though.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.229

08:42.594 --> 08:44.165
I really thought that
that was gonna work.

08:44.198 --> 08:45.401
Really did not.

08:45.434 --> 08:46.803
Yeah, well, the
fire suppression's working,

08:46.836 --> 08:48.373
but the gas just won't shut off.

he obviously didn't, so...

the gas line first, Chef.

we don't say hi to people?

a Danish tradition?

09:12.488 --> 09:13.590
Relax.
I was gonna surprise you.

09:13.623 --> 09:14.492
We just don't
say hello anymore?

-Dextrose.

Whoa.

09:32.828 --> 09:34.699
Very yes. Yo, what's up?
We good?

09:34.732 --> 09:37.438
Hi. Um, not really.
Fridge is still broken as fuck.

-CARMY: Fuck. Right. Shit.
-SYDNEY: Yeah.

09:38.807 --> 09:40.443
CARMY:
I'm sorry. I just, um...

09:40.777 --> 09:42.848
Fuck. I had this gnarly
panic attack last night,

09:42.881 --> 09:46.222
and I was telling, uh,
Claire about this time, uh,

09:46.255 --> 09:47.658
this time at Christmas.

09:47.691 --> 09:49.929
My mom drove her car
through the house.

09:49.962 --> 09:51.499
-Um, who's Claire?
-She's a girl that’s a friend.

09:51.532 --> 09:53.236
Ooh, it's his girlfriend.
Oh, so, so sorry.

09:53.269 --> 09:54.439
She's a girl that's a friend?

09:54.472 --> 09:56.309
-She's a girlfriend? You think?
-Ooh.

09:56.342 --> 09:58.513
Okay. Uh, next.
Your mom drove a car
through a house?

09:58.546 --> 10:01.786
Yes. Our house.
It was actually very fucked.

10:01.819 --> 10:02.854
Um...

10:03.489 --> 10:06.529
Anyway, we would always have,
uh, cannolis, you know,

10:06.562 --> 10:08.233
after Christmas dinner.

10:08.266 --> 10:10.738
And so I always hated cannolis
'cause I associated them

10:10.771 --> 10:12.875
with my weird,
fucked-up family and, um.

10:12.908 --> 10:14.645
And, I don't know, I was
talking to Claire last night

10:14.678 --> 10:16.249
and I kinda had
this-this realization

10:16.282 --> 10:18.620
that maybe I could,
I could kinda take them back,

10:18.653 --> 10:19.956
you know, make them my own.

10:19.989 --> 10:21.792
The cannolis, you know.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.398
O-okay. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah.

10:24.431 --> 10:26.403
-That's healthy.
-CARMY: Thank you. Yes.

10:26.436 --> 10:27.638
I've been thinking
about cannolis

10:27.671 --> 10:30.811
and more specifically,
um, savory ones.

10:30.844 --> 10:33.250
-Okay. Like with
the mortadella mousse?
-CARMY: Mm-hmm.

10:33.283 --> 10:34.786
-Parmesan shell.
-CARMY: Yeah. Yeah.

10:34.819 --> 10:36.389
Uh, dipped in pistachio.

10:36.422 --> 10:38.226
-Ooh. That's something.
-That's something, right?

10:38.259 --> 10:40.531
-On it.

the fire suppression exam

11:56.549 --> 11:59.722
might be between the hours
of 1:00 and 3:00?

11:59.755 --> 12:01.559

12:22.668 --> 12:23.769
You may sit.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.452
-Hit me.
-I, uh...

12:33.456 --> 12:35.427
I wanna apologize.

12:35.460 --> 12:37.497
(soft chuckle) For?

12:38.566 --> 12:39.902
Everything, I guess.

12:39.935 --> 12:41.506
SUGAR: Okay, hold on.

12:41.539 --> 12:42.675
Hey, can the closest person

12:42.708 --> 12:44.412
outside my office
come in here, please?

12:44.445 --> 12:45.380
What's up, Nat?

12:45.414 --> 12:47.918
Gary, Richie would like
to apologize to me,

12:47.951 --> 12:48.887
and I'd like a witness.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.356
-Hell, yeah.
-SUGAR: Yeah.

12:52.928 --> 12:54.432
Go ahead.

12:54.465 --> 12:55.534
I'm being serious.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.536
Yeah, so am I.

12:56.569 --> 12:57.904
Turn up the heat.
Let's go.

12:59.942 --> 13:01.078
Alright. Um...

13:03.583 --> 13:06.422
I think for a long time,
I didn't really know

13:06.455 --> 13:08.994
where I fit, you know, and...

13:09.027 --> 13:11.399
I would shove myself
into, like, places

13:11.432 --> 13:13.970
and things where
I definitely did not fit.

13:14.003 --> 13:16.542
And I think that
that probably...

13:18.112 --> 13:21.819
definitely...
made things worse.

13:23.589 --> 13:26.796
And I'm sorry

13:26.829 --> 13:29.835
if I took anything out on you

13:29.868 --> 13:34.745
and if I treated you like shit.

13:34.778 --> 13:39.622
Um, because I actually do think
that we could fit good together.

13:39.655 --> 13:42.428
I could be good at things
that you don't really wanna do.

13:42.461 --> 13:44.131
And you're obviously really
great at a whole bunch of stuff

13:44.164 --> 13:47.404
that I don't know how to do,
you know?

13:50.009 --> 13:51.713
That's why
you're wearing the suit.

13:51.746 --> 13:53.717
Um... I'm wearing a suit

13:53.750 --> 13:55.687
'cause it makes me
feel better about myself.

14:03.202 --> 14:05.574
What do we think?

14:05.607 --> 14:07.044
I think he did
a really nice job.

14:07.077 --> 14:08.613
Thanks, Gary.

14:08.646 --> 14:09.649
It felt genuine.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.052
Like from his soul.
No G&R.

14:11.085 --> 14:12.921
Why are you
wearing a suit?

14:12.954 --> 14:14.158
Why are you covered in shit?

14:14.191 --> 14:15.460
I was fixing the gas line.

14:15.493 --> 14:16.663
Well, I wear suits now.

14:16.696 --> 14:17.631
That's so sick.

14:17.665 --> 14:19.168
Neil, honey, can you
get the fuck outta here?

14:19.201 --> 14:20.837
You're getting dirt everywhere.

14:20.870 --> 14:23.476
Well... can my sister
come to Friends and Family?

14:23.509 --> 14:25.647
(laughs) Francie Fak?

14:25.680 --> 14:27.016
No, she can go fuck, my love.

14:27.050 --> 14:28.186
Is it 'cause
of the thing or like--

14:28.219 --> 14:29.155
What do you think?

14:29.188 --> 14:30.190
You-- Really?

14:30.223 --> 14:32.594
-Use your brain, babe.
-FAK: Yeah.

14:32.961 --> 14:34.498
"Is it because of the thing?"

14:34.531 --> 14:36.502
No gavones
at Friends and Family.

14:36.535 --> 14:37.905
Francie Fak.

14:37.938 --> 14:39.208
(Sugar scoffs)

14:39.241 --> 14:40.610
SUGAR:
(whispers) Stupid...

14:41.345 --> 14:43.650
Look, Natalie, you know,
if there's anything at all

14:43.683 --> 14:47.057
that I can do to make
your life here easier, tell me,

14:47.090 --> 14:48.626
I'll fucking do it.

14:49.828 --> 14:51.199
I need this place to work.

14:51.232 --> 14:53.069
We need this place
to work.

14:57.077 --> 14:58.680
(sighs)

14:58.713 --> 14:59.848
Baby steps.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.690
Okay?
You and I will interview
front of house today.

15:03.723 --> 15:04.959
-Okay.
-SUGAR: Okay.

15:04.992 --> 15:06.027
-Deal.
-SUGAR: Deal.

15:07.064 --> 15:08.900
Deal.

15:08.933 --> 15:11.072
Oh-ho-ho. Ma.
Ma que bella.

15:11.105 --> 15:12.808
-SUGAR: Yep.
-RICHIE: Oh, my God.

15:12.841 --> 15:13.810
I know.

15:13.843 --> 15:15.680
Where the fuck
does the time go?

15:16.749 --> 15:17.951
SUGAR: I don't know.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.020
Hey.

15:20.090 --> 15:22.093
Thank you for apologizing.

15:25.834 --> 15:27.137
(sighs) Okay.

15:32.547 --> 15:34.552
TINA:
Garde manger
needs to see...

15:34.585 --> 15:37.758
-CARMY: Corner.
-TINA: ...at the station.

15:37.791 --> 15:39.762
-Behind. Behind.
-SYDNEY: Behind. Behind.

15:39.795 --> 15:40.864
Um, hey, hey.

15:40.897 --> 15:42.233
I wanted to, uh,
show you something.

15:42.767 --> 15:45.173
Um... I was
thinking about the, uh,

15:45.206 --> 15:46.876
the-the grapes
and the bone broth.

15:46.909 --> 15:48.046
-Right? Um...
-SYDNEY: Sure.

15:48.079 --> 15:49.849
Wait. What is this?

15:49.882 --> 15:52.254
Are we, are we drawing?
Are we doing drawings now?

15:52.287 --> 15:54.023
Well, no. I had to draw these
'cause we didn't have the heat,

15:54.057 --> 15:55.259
-so I couldn't show you--
-You had to draw them?

15:55.293 --> 15:57.898
So then you, like,
whip out these
fuckin' Sistine Chapel--

15:57.931 --> 15:59.902
-Like, there's,
like, shading here.
-Yeah. Right.

15:59.935 --> 16:01.706
Okay, just listen.
So, uh, uh...

16:01.739 --> 16:03.008
I-I was thinking,
we'd do the, uh,

16:03.042 --> 16:05.814
frozen grapes
in a bowl standalone, right?

16:05.847 --> 16:08.253
-And then--
-We'd pour the broth over hot.

16:08.286 --> 16:09.455
-CARMY: Yes. Exactly.
-Tableside. That's nice.

16:09.488 --> 16:12.661
And then I did...
I had this other thought
that, um...

16:12.694 --> 16:14.598
-TINA: Housekeeping, Chef.
-I'm sorry, that's just,
that’s actually...

16:14.631 --> 16:16.602
This is just
driving me fuckin' crazy.

16:16.635 --> 16:18.807
SYDNEY: This, um,
prosciutto, by the way,

16:18.840 --> 16:20.243
do we know
where we're sourcing this?

16:20.276 --> 16:21.312
Uh, yeah, yeah.

16:21.345 --> 16:22.848
My homie, uh,
from high school,

16:22.881 --> 16:25.253
he's running
an Iberico account, and, uh,

16:25.286 --> 16:26.789
-so he's gonna hook it up.
-SYDNEY: Great. Okay.

16:26.822 --> 16:29.662
Uh, did we talk to him
about a deal or...

16:29.695 --> 16:31.299
Uh, yeah,
I'll give you his number

16:31.332 --> 16:33.069
and, uh, you can go ahead
and you can call him.

16:33.102 --> 16:35.974
Oh, um, we can get tardivo
at the same place

16:36.007 --> 16:37.744
that we're getting
our spinach, by the way.

16:37.777 --> 16:38.880
-So...
-Oh, no, no. We actually...

16:38.913 --> 16:40.015
We don't need
the spinach anymore.

16:40.049 --> 16:41.017
Why don't we need
the spinach anymore?

16:41.051 --> 16:42.854
Well, I had a thought,
if you could just, um...

16:43.489 --> 16:45.260
Thank you.
I had a thought on, um...

16:45.293 --> 16:47.164
on plating.

16:47.197 --> 16:49.201
Um, I'll show you...

16:50.970 --> 16:53.743
-...uh, here.
-This looks kinda like
a chaos menu.

16:53.776 --> 16:55.747
Well, no, it's like,
it's a thoughtful chaos menu.

16:55.780 --> 16:57.784
-Oh.
-Look, Claire and I,

16:57.817 --> 16:59.722
we were talking
about it last night,

16:59.755 --> 17:01.993
and-and she helped me realize
that maybe I was clinging on

17:02.026 --> 17:03.930
to some things that...

17:03.963 --> 17:05.133
I don't know, maybe I just,

17:05.166 --> 17:07.104
I don't care that much
about anymore.

17:07.137 --> 17:09.007
Right?
And this is good, right?

17:09.041 --> 17:10.710
'Cause this is,
this is what you wanted.

17:10.743 --> 17:13.015
-Uh, yeah, it is. Yeah.
-CARMY: Right.

17:13.049 --> 17:14.919
Um, yeah, okay.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.222
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

17:16.255 --> 17:18.059
Great. Tell Claire
I said thank you, then.

17:18.092 --> 17:19.261
TINA:
Take your time.

17:19.294 --> 17:20.897
-Yeah, totally.
-Totally.

17:22.801 --> 17:25.273
Yo. Why are you
being like that?
What's up?

17:25.306 --> 17:28.379
(sighs) I just, um, I didn't
know that we were, like,

17:28.412 --> 17:30.050
running our menu
by Claire.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.686
We're not running
the menu by Claire.

17:31.719 --> 17:32.921
Should I also send
my revised COGS
to your girlfriend?

17:32.955 --> 17:35.025
You don't need
to send anything--
She's not my girlfriend.

17:35.059 --> 17:36.996
-So she's not even
your girlfriend.
-Right.

17:37.029 --> 17:38.700
And we're, like,
arranging this menu--

17:38.733 --> 17:39.802
She's not arranging anything,

17:39.835 --> 17:41.038
and she's not looking
at the menu.

17:41.072 --> 17:42.674
-Yeah she is, man.
-This is what
you wanted originally,

17:42.707 --> 17:43.977
and that's what I'm giving you,
and so awesome?

17:44.010 --> 17:45.780
-No, not awesome.
-CARMY: And I'm sorry.

17:45.813 --> 17:47.684
I, like, fucking, like,
hated cannolis my whole life

17:47.717 --> 17:48.853
-and now--
-Stop, stop. Stop.

17:48.886 --> 17:49.821
Stop.

17:52.427 --> 17:53.663
(Sydney sighs)

17:53.696 --> 17:54.798
-Sorry.
-SYDNEY: I'm sorry.

17:54.831 --> 17:56.402
Okay? I'm tired.

17:56.435 --> 17:58.239
-No. No, no, no. I'm sorry.
-I'm... I've-I've been tired,

17:58.272 --> 18:00.777
but I'm really tired,
and that wasn't cool.

18:00.810 --> 18:02.047
-Yes. Same.
-SYDNEY: And... Okay.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.218
-I am tired. And, um...
-Alright.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.021
CARMY:
Like, wherever
I'm-I'm-I'm fuckin' up,

18:06.055 --> 18:08.092
just let me know
I'm-I'm fuckin' up

18:08.125 --> 18:10.330
'cause I am, like, I'm...
You know, I'm trying.

18:10.363 --> 18:12.134
I know that you're trying.
I see that you're trying.

18:12.167 --> 18:14.338
Obviously.
You're fuckin' doing
these beautiful drawings.

18:14.371 --> 18:15.707
Obviously
you're trying, it's--

18:15.740 --> 18:17.076
-CARMY: Right.
-Yeah.

18:18.479 --> 18:19.848
Okay, so we're like...

18:21.852 --> 18:23.089
We're okay? We're back?

18:23.122 --> 18:24.124
-We are good.
-CARMY: Good.

18:24.157 --> 18:25.760
-We're good? Okay.
-Yes.

18:25.793 --> 18:28.166
I just think
you need to decide.

18:28.199 --> 18:30.036
What do you mean?
What do I need to decide?

18:30.069 --> 18:31.239
SYDNEY:
I mean, many things.

18:31.272 --> 18:34.078
But chief among them
might be if this person

18:34.111 --> 18:37.250
is your girlfriend
or your friend that's a girl.

18:37.751 --> 18:39.921
-Yeah, right, that's...
-SYDNEY: So...

18:40.323 --> 18:42.260
-I'm being shitty?
-SYDNEY: I mean, not great.

18:43.262 --> 18:44.998
-Okay.
-SYDNEY: Yeah.

18:48.773 --> 18:51.144
Listen, I don't, I don't,
I don't wanna be, uh, shitty.

18:52.981 --> 18:55.120
Okay. So don't be.

18:55.153 --> 18:57.090
-(knives chopping)
-TINA: Behind.

18:57.991 --> 19:00.096
Oh, cool. So, like,
I just won't be then.

19:00.129 --> 19:01.365
-Okay, alright.
-Like, that'll work.

19:01.398 --> 19:03.202
Relax. Yeah, yeah.

19:03.803 --> 19:06.309
I'm a problem solver,
and you always
put the restaurant first.

19:06.342 --> 19:09.949
So whatever I have to do to
put out a fire, lead or follow,

19:09.982 --> 19:11.052
I'm doing it.

19:11.085 --> 19:12.087
SUGAR:
That's a great answer.

19:12.120 --> 19:12.988
Thank you.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.091
You'll be hearing from us.

19:14.124 --> 19:15.093
Really lookin' forward to it.

19:15.126 --> 19:16.162
Yeah, us, too.

19:16.195 --> 19:17.964
-Thanks.
-RICHIE: Hey, good luck.

19:19.067 --> 19:20.403
SUGAR: Bye.

19:20.436 --> 19:22.474
-(door opens and closes)
-I mean...

19:22.507 --> 19:23.943
Well, she ain't it.

19:25.279 --> 19:27.084
She's got seven years.

19:27.117 --> 19:28.920
Elske, Oriole, Smyth.

19:28.953 --> 19:30.523
Yeah, that's a lot of
moving around for seven years,

19:30.556 --> 19:32.060
but that's not
why we can't hire her.

19:32.093 --> 19:33.329
Okay, why can't we hire her?

19:33.362 --> 19:35.400
We can't hire her
because every single napkin

19:35.433 --> 19:37.337
on this table is folded
in alignment

19:37.370 --> 19:39.108
with the salad fork
except for hers.

19:39.141 --> 19:41.212
She just... sat there.

19:41.245 --> 19:42.814
What do you mean?

19:42.847 --> 19:44.952
We're here for 20 minutes.

19:44.985 --> 19:46.956
She's there looking at that,

19:46.989 --> 19:48.959
knowing that napkin's
facing the wrong direction.

19:49.594 --> 19:52.300
Did you turn the napkin
beforehand?

19:52.333 --> 19:54.538
Sugar, you guys want stars.
That ain't a star catcher.

19:54.571 --> 19:56.342
If I'm her, that napkin

19:56.375 --> 19:58.179
would've driven me
fuckin' crazy,

19:58.212 --> 19:59.781
and I would have fixed it.

20:02.387 --> 20:05.025
-(sighs)
-Wow.

20:05.059 --> 20:06.228
You turned the napkin.

20:06.261 --> 20:07.931
Yeah.
Of course, I did.

-Yeah.
