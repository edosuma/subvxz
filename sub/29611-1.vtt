23:28.165 --> 23:31.623
I need to explain myself
to these fuckers?

23:31.790 --> 23:35.623
I'm the only one
who takes responsibility!

23:35.790 --> 23:37.331
Taking care of business!

23:37.499 --> 23:39.623
So that these bitches can eat.

23:39.874 --> 23:42.414
I've seen that RV
at a vintage car market.

23:42.665 --> 23:46.623
I can sell it tomorrow for 40,000.
It's easy as pie, man!

23:54.957 --> 23:58.831
-Where is the dope?
-It's easy, Bodo.

23:58.999 --> 24:01.414
Just come up with a story
for these losers.

24:01.582 --> 24:04.956
Then there'll be 20,000 for you
and 20,000 for me. Basta.

24:14.332 --> 24:16.956
-You don't have the dope?
-No, but the car.

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.831
Do you know how sad mama is?

01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:34.748
Why have you never tried calling?!

01:14:39.582 --> 01:14:41.498
Couldn't you have done that?

01:14:42.332 --> 01:14:43.956
Are you out of your mind?

01:17:02.665 --> 01:17:06.789
One night he hurt himself
when hiding under a truck.

01:17:07.707 --> 01:17:09.539
His leg was broken.

01:17:09.874 --> 01:17:11.789
He was in a lot of pain.

01:17:12.624 --> 01:17:14.206
Before the accident he was strong.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.373
Always dancing.

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:20.623
Always in a good mood.

01:17:21.457 --> 01:17:24.956
But he has changed.

01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:29.623
He started drinking and taking drugs.

01:17:30.082 --> 01:17:31.748
To endure the pain.

01:17:32.582 --> 01:17:33.998
He's not well.

01:17:35.832 --> 01:17:37.414
Will you take him home?

01:17:39.249 --> 01:17:40.706
Back to Congo?

01:17:46.124 --> 01:17:47.331
Yes.
