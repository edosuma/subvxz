WEBVTT

00:09.579 --> 00:10.111
>> John: HEY THERE, IT'S ME.

00:10.180 --> 00:10.678
THE SHOW HASN'T STARTED YET.

00:10.747 --> 00:12.013
I MEAN, CLEARLY, IT'S STARTED A

00:12.082 --> 00:12.980
LITTLE BIT.

00:13.049 --> 00:14.515
I AM ALREADY TALKING TO YOU.

00:14.584 --> 00:16.617
BUT BEFORE THE MUSIC AND THE

00:16.686 --> 00:23.558
LIGHTS AND AT LEAST --

00:23.627 --> 00:24.192
THEORETICALLY -- THE LAUGHTER --

00:24.261 --> 00:24.826
I WANTED TO BRIEFLY TALK TO YOU

00:24.895 --> 00:25.393
ABOUT WHAT'S CLEARLY BEEN A

00:25.462 --> 00:25.726
TERRIBLE WEEK.

00:25.795 --> 00:26.360
THE IMMENSE SUFFERING IN ISRAEL

00:26.429 --> 00:26.961
AND GAZA HAS BEEN SICKENING TO

00:27.030 --> 00:28.129
WATCH.

00:28.198 --> 00:29.897
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE

00:29.966 --> 00:30.965
COVERING IT IN THE MAIN BODY OF

00:31.034 --> 00:31.599
OUR SHOW TONIGHT, FOR A COUPLE

00:31.668 --> 00:32.233
OF REASONS.

00:32.302 --> 00:33.668
FIRST, IT'S HORRIFIC.

00:33.737 --> 00:34.869
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO TELL

00:34.938 --> 00:36.237
JOKES ABOUT CARNAGE RIGHT NOW,

00:36.306 --> 00:38.072
AND I'M PRETTY SURE YOU DON'T

00:38.141 --> 00:39.207
WANT TO HEAR THEM.

00:39.276 --> 00:40.708
AND SECOND, WE'RE TAPING THIS ON

00:40.777 --> 00:42.710
SATURDAY AFTERNOON, AND YOU'LL

00:42.779 --> 00:44.045
BE WATCHING IT SUNDAY NIGHT, OR

00:44.114 --> 00:45.680
MONDAY MORNING THROUGH AN

00:45.749 --> 00:47.014
ILLEGAL VPN -- I DO KNOW WHO I

00:47.083 --> 00:48.649
AM TALKING TO.

00:48.718 --> 00:51.686
BUT THE POINT IS, GIVEN HOW FAST

00:51.755 --> 00:53.654
THINGS ARE MOVING, A LOT COULD

00:53.723 --> 00:55.523
CHANGE BETWEEN THE TIME I'M

00:55.592 --> 00:56.157
SAYING THIS, AND THE TIME THAT

00:56.226 --> 00:59.827
YOU HEAR IT.

00:59.896 --> 01:00.495
BUT I DO HAVE A FEW BROAD

01:00.564 --> 01:01.129
THOUGHTS THAT I THINK WILL STILL

01:01.198 --> 01:02.430
APPLY.

01:02.499 --> 01:03.464
AND THEY HAVE TO DO WITH SORROW,

01:03.533 --> 01:08.569
FEAR AND ANGER.

01:08.638 --> 01:09.203
NOW SORROW IS THE FIRST AND MOST

01:09.272 --> 01:09.670
OVERWHELMING FEELING.

01:09.739 --> 01:11.472
THE IMAGES WE'VE SEEN THIS WEEK,

01:11.541 --> 01:12.106
FROM LAST SATURDAY ONWARDS, HAVE

01:12.175 --> 01:14.942
BEEN HEARTBREAKING.

01:15.011 --> 01:15.710
THOUSANDS ARE NOW DEAD IN ISRAEL

01:15.779 --> 01:17.445
AND GAZA.

01:17.514 --> 01:20.148
IT'S BEEN DEVASTATING, NOT JUST

01:20.217 --> 01:20.848
TO THOSE IN THE REGION BUT TO

01:20.917 --> 01:21.883
DIASPORA COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE

01:21.952 --> 01:22.383
WORLD.

01:22.452 --> 01:25.219
WHATEVER THOUGHTS YOU HAVE ABOUT

01:25.288 --> 01:26.587
THE HISTORY OF THIS REGION, OR

01:26.656 --> 01:27.221
THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS --

01:27.290 --> 01:28.523
AND I'VE SHARED MINE ON THIS

01:28.592 --> 01:29.991
SHOW IN THE PAST -- IT SHOULD BE

01:30.060 --> 01:31.759
IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE GRIEVING

01:31.828 --> 01:34.262
FAMILIES AND NOT BE MOVED.

01:34.331 --> 01:35.730
SO THERE'S BEEN SORROW THIS

01:35.799 --> 01:36.898
WEEK, A LOT OF IT, AND ALSO

01:36.967 --> 01:39.167
FEAR.

01:39.236 --> 01:40.768
UNDERSTANDABLE FEAR OF FURTHER

01:40.837 --> 01:47.837
ATTACKS IN ISRAEL.

01:47.944 --> 01:48.476
AND FOR THOSE TAKEN HOSTAGE.

01:48.545 --> 01:49.076
AND FEAR OF WHAT'S TO COME IN

01:49.145 --> 01:49.677
GAZA, AS ISRAEL'S LEADERS SEEM

01:49.746 --> 01:56.746
INTENT ON EMBARKING ON A

01:57.587 --> 01:58.085
RELENTLESS BOMBING CAMPAIGN,

01:58.154 --> 01:58.553
MASS DISPLACEMENT, AND

01:58.622 --> 01:59.120
A POTENTIAL GROUND INVASION.

01:59.189 --> 01:59.754
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THINGS STAND

01:59.823 --> 02:00.388
IN GAZA AS YOU WATCH THIS RIGHT

02:00.457 --> 02:00.988
NOW, BUT ALL SIGNS SEEM TO BE

02:01.057 --> 02:01.589
POINTING TOWARD A HUMANITARIAN

02:01.658 --> 02:04.692
CATASTROPHE.

02:04.761 --> 02:06.461
ISRAELI OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED

02:06.530 --> 02:08.496
PLANS TO CUT OFF WATER, FUEL,

02:08.565 --> 02:08.763
AND POWER.

02:08.832 --> 02:09.263
HOSPITALS ARE RUNNING ON

02:09.332 --> 02:10.898
GENERATORS.

02:10.967 --> 02:12.033
THIS HAS ALL THE APPEARANCES OF

02:12.102 --> 02:12.667
COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT, WHICH IS

02:12.736 --> 02:15.002
A WAR CRIME.

02:15.071 --> 02:16.671
AND I THINK MANY ISRAELIS AND

02:16.740 --> 02:19.173
PALESTINIANS ARE FEELING

02:19.242 --> 02:22.009
JUSTIFIABLE ANGER RIGHT NOW --

02:22.078 --> 02:25.379
NOT JUST AT HAMAS, WHOSE HEINOUS

02:25.448 --> 02:27.949
TERRORIST ACTS SET THE WEEK'S

02:28.018 --> 02:28.983
EVENTS IN MOTION, BUT ALSO AT

02:29.052 --> 02:29.851
THE ZEALOTS AND EXTREMISTS,

02:29.920 --> 02:32.053
ACROSS THE BOARD, WHO'VE

02:32.122 --> 02:33.154
CONSISTENTLY THWARTED ATTEMPTS

02:33.223 --> 02:35.556
AT PEACE OVER THE YEARS.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.091
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS HAVE

02:37.160 --> 02:37.758
BEEN LET DOWN BY THEIR

02:37.827 --> 02:41.028
LEADERSHIP TIME AND TIME AGAIN,

02:41.097 --> 02:42.497
AND I DON'T HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF

02:42.566 --> 02:44.365
FAITH IN THE LEADERS CURRENTLY

02:44.434 --> 02:44.932
IN CHARGE TO STEER US TOWARD

02:45.001 --> 02:46.934
PEACE.

02:47.003 --> 02:50.171
BUT I DO STILL HAVE SOME HOPE.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.640
BECAUSE THE EASIEST THING TO DO

02:52.709 --> 02:54.442
IN THE WORLD, AFTER A WEEK LIKE

02:54.511 --> 02:54.909
THIS, IS TO ENGAGE IN

02:54.978 --> 02:57.745
BLOODTHIRSTY RHETORIC.

02:57.814 --> 02:59.213
AND THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN

02:59.282 --> 02:59.781
PLENTY OF THAT FROM THOSE IN

02:59.850 --> 03:01.382
POWER.

03:01.451 --> 03:02.750
BUT I WILL SAY, I'VE BEEN STRUCK

03:02.819 --> 03:06.087
BY THE MANY ORDINARY CITIZENS,

03:06.156 --> 03:06.687
BOTH ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN,

03:06.756 --> 03:08.156
WHO'VE CALLED FOR RESTRAINT THIS

03:08.225 --> 03:11.125
WEEK, AND NOT REVENGE.

03:11.194 --> 03:12.660
JUST LISTEN TO HOW NOI KATZMAN,

03:12.729 --> 03:15.096
WHOSE BROTHER HAYIM WAS MURDERED

03:15.165 --> 03:17.265
BY HAMAS LAST SATURDAY, CHOSE TO

03:17.334 --> 03:18.566
END THIS INTERVIEW.

03:18.635 --> 03:20.101
>> I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

03:20.170 --> 03:22.570
>> CAN I SAY ONE MORE THING?

03:22.639 --> 03:23.871
>> YEAH.

03:23.940 --> 03:24.672
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR --

03:24.741 --> 03:26.541
>> YEAH, SO, WHAT I WANTED TO

03:26.610 --> 03:28.176
SAY IS, THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR

03:28.245 --> 03:29.911
ME, AND I THINK ALSO FOR MY

03:29.980 --> 03:32.647
BROTHER, WAS THAT HIS DEATH

03:32.716 --> 03:33.714
WON'T BE USED TO KILL INNOCENT

03:33.783 --> 03:35.650
PEOPLE.

03:35.719 --> 03:36.784
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN

03:36.853 --> 03:37.952
TO PEOPLE IN GAZA LIKE IT

03:38.021 --> 03:39.153
HAPPENS TO MY BROTHER.

03:39.222 --> 03:40.321
AND I'M SURE HE WOULDN'T HAVE

03:40.390 --> 03:42.757
ANY -- EITHER.

03:42.826 --> 03:44.058
SO THAT'S MY CALL TO MY

03:44.127 --> 03:45.760
GOVERNMENT.

03:45.829 --> 03:48.696
STOP KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE.

03:48.765 --> 03:49.697
AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT

03:49.766 --> 03:52.366
BRINGS US PEACE AND SECURITY TO

03:52.435 --> 03:53.868
PEOPLE IN ISRAEL.

03:53.937 --> 03:55.303
>> John: RIGHT.

03:55.372 --> 03:56.838
PEOPLE WANT AND ARE ENTITLED TO

03:56.907 --> 03:58.739
PEACE.

03:58.808 --> 04:00.174
AND I'M NOT GOING TO TELL EITHER

04:00.243 --> 04:01.509
SIDE HOW TO GET IT -- CERTAINLY

04:01.578 --> 04:03.377
NOT IN THIS ACCENT, WHICH HAS

04:03.446 --> 04:06.214
FRANKLY DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE IN

04:06.283 --> 04:07.181
THAT PARTICULAR REGION TO LAST

04:07.250 --> 04:09.750
A FUCKING LIFETIME.

04:09.819 --> 04:11.452
BUT JUST KNOW, IN THE LONG TERM,

04:11.521 --> 04:12.820
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE

04:12.889 --> 04:14.355
IN THAT REGION ARE GOING TO KEEP

04:14.424 --> 04:16.224
LIVING THERE.

04:16.293 --> 04:18.960
SO PEACE IS NOT OPTIONAL, AND

04:19.029 --> 04:19.460
WILL REQUIRE SOME TOUGH

04:19.529 --> 04:21.729
DECISIONS.

04:21.798 --> 04:23.631
AND I CAN'T SAY WHERE A PEACE

04:23.700 --> 04:24.265
PROCESS ENDS, BUT IT JUST HAS TO

04:24.334 --> 04:25.967
START WITH THAT KIND OF ABILITY

04:26.036 --> 04:28.302
TO RECOGNIZE OUR COMMON

04:28.371 --> 04:30.104
HUMANITY.

04:30.173 --> 04:32.473
THAT'S HONESTLY ALL I'VE GOT FOR

04:32.542 --> 04:34.108
YOU RIGHT NOW, BUT WE DO STILL

04:34.177 --> 04:36.744
HAVE OUR REGULAR COMEDY SHOW.

04:36.813 --> 04:37.979
AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, I'LL

04:38.048 --> 04:40.148
SEE YOU THE OTHER SIDE OF OUR

04:40.217 --> 04:41.849
OPENING TITLES, WHEN THERE'LL BE

04:41.918 --> 04:43.451
LIGHTS, THERE'LL BE MUSIC AND --

04:43.520 --> 04:45.620
AGAIN, PURELY THEORETICALLY, NO

04:45.689 --> 04:47.855
PRESSURE ON THE AUDIENCE -- AT

04:47.924 --> 04:50.758
LEAST SOME SPORADIC LAUGHTER.

04:50.827 --> 04:51.726

WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

05:19.623 --> 05:21.823
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANK YOU SO

05:21.892 --> 05:22.423
MUCH FOR JOINING US.

05:22.492 --> 05:24.492
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

05:24.561 --> 05:25.927
RFK JR. ANNOUNCED HE'S RUNNING

JADA PINKETT SMITH REVEALED THAT

05:28.365 --> 05:30.164
SHE AND WILL HAVE BEEN SEPARATED

05:30.233 --> 05:32.133
SINCE 2016, AND SENATOR

05:32.202 --> 05:33.701
BOB MENENDEZ FOUND HIMSELF IN

05:33.770 --> 05:35.503
WHAT'S KNOWN IN THE LEGAL WORLD

05:35.572 --> 05:37.472
AS "EVEN DEEPER SHIT."

05:37.541 --> 05:38.506
BUT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

05:38.575 --> 05:39.273
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING ON

05:39.342 --> 05:40.408
CAPITOL HILL.

05:40.477 --> 05:41.309
IT'S NOW BEEN A WEEK AND A HALF

05:41.378 --> 05:42.343
SINCE EIGHT REPRESENTATIVES

05:42.412 --> 05:43.811
STAGED A COUP AGAINST KEVIN

05:43.880 --> 05:45.279
McCARTHY, AND EVER SINCE, THE

05:45.348 --> 05:46.481
PARTY HAS BEEN STRUGGLING TO

05:46.550 --> 05:47.615
PICK A NEW SPEAKER.

05:47.684 --> 05:49.650
STEVE SCALISE WON A SECRET

05:49.719 --> 05:51.152
BALLOT ON WEDNESDAY TO BE PUT

05:51.221 --> 05:52.420
FORWARD FOR A VOTE AS SPEAKER,

05:52.489 --> 05:53.588
ONLY TO WITHDRAW THE FOLLOWING

05:53.657 --> 05:55.423
DAY, AFTER IT BECAME CLEAR HE

05:55.492 --> 05:55.957
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WIN A

05:56.026 --> 05:57.258
MAJORITY.

05:57.327 --> 05:58.359
AND ONE NOTABLE HOUSE MEMBER

05:58.428 --> 06:00.361
SUMMED UP WHY HE PERSONALLY

06:00.430 --> 06:02.163
COULD NEVER VOTE FOR SCALISE.

06:02.232 --> 06:03.164
>> I'VE REACHED OUT NUMEROUS

06:03.233 --> 06:05.333
TIMES TO CONGRESSMAN SCALISE,

06:05.402 --> 06:06.634
AND ME REACHING OUT AND ASKING

06:06.703 --> 06:07.902
HIM FOR GUIDANCE IN HIS

06:07.971 --> 06:09.504
LEADERSHIP AND HIM NOT REACHING

06:09.573 --> 06:11.539
BACK OUT, THAT'S A DERELICTION

06:11.608 --> 06:12.774
OF HIS DUTY AS A LEADER, SO I'M

06:12.843 --> 06:13.674
NOT VOTING FOR SOMEBODY WHO

06:13.743 --> 06:14.242
LACKS FUNDAMENTAL LEADERSHIP

06:14.311 --> 06:15.543
SKILLS.

06:15.612 --> 06:16.010
>> IS HE SNUBBING YOU?

06:16.079 --> 06:16.611
>> I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T CARE,

06:16.680 --> 06:18.579
QUITE FRANKLY.

06:18.648 --> 06:19.280
>> John: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT

06:19.349 --> 06:24.218
THAT?

06:24.287 --> 06:25.987
BECAUSE IT REALLY SEEMS LIKE

06:26.056 --> 06:26.554
IT'S BECAUSE SCALISE SNUBBED

06:26.623 --> 06:26.721
YOU.

06:26.790 --> 06:27.355
HONESTLY, SANTOS SAYING "I DON'T

06:27.424 --> 06:27.955
CARE" IN A TONE THAT MAKES IT

06:28.024 --> 06:30.892
CLEAR HE ABSOLUTELY CARES,

06:30.961 --> 06:32.126
MIGHT BE THE MOST TRANSPARENT

06:32.195 --> 06:33.294
LIE THAT HE'S EVER TOLD.

06:33.363 --> 06:34.061
WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING,

06:34.130 --> 06:34.996
BECAUSE REMEMBER -- THIS IS A

06:35.065 --> 06:36.063
MAN WHO SAID HE WAS A STAR

06:36.132 --> 06:37.799
VOLLEYBALL PLAYER AT A COLLEGE

06:37.868 --> 06:39.066
HE DIDN'T EVEN GO TO, AND SAID

06:39.135 --> 06:40.768
9/11 CLAIMED HIS MOTHER'S LIFE

06:40.837 --> 06:41.936
EVEN THOUGH RECORDS SHOW THAT

06:42.005 --> 06:42.537
SHE WASN'T IN NEW YORK AND SHE

06:42.606 --> 06:46.340
DIED IN 2016.

06:46.409 --> 06:48.843
FOR GEORGE SANTOS, AN ALMOST

06:48.912 --> 06:52.079
CLINICALLY CHAOTIC MAN, TO

06:52.148 --> 06:52.547
DECIDE YOU DON'T HAVE

06:52.616 --> 06:53.181
FUNDAMENTAL LEADERSHIP SKILLS IS

06:53.250 --> 06:55.883
TRULY DAMNING.

06:55.952 --> 06:57.118
ALL WEEK LONG, REPUBLICANS MET

06:57.187 --> 06:58.119
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS TO TRY AND

06:58.188 --> 06:58.820
PICK A LEADER.

06:58.889 --> 07:00.888
ALTHOUGH GLIMPSES OF CHAOS KEPT

07:00.957 --> 07:02.690
LEAKING INTO PUBLIC VIEW, LIKE

07:02.759 --> 07:03.958
WHEN ONE REPRESENTATIVE WAS SEEN

07:04.027 --> 07:05.159
BRINGING A LASSO INTO THE

07:05.228 --> 07:06.427
SESSION.

07:06.496 --> 07:07.695
AND YOU KNOW THINGS ARE MESSY

07:07.764 --> 07:09.630
WHEN A U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN WALKS

07:09.699 --> 07:10.932
DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH SOME HORSE

07:11.001 --> 07:12.300
EQUIPMENT AND ALL ANYONE CAN SAY

07:12.369 --> 07:13.134
IS, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:13.203 --> 07:15.736
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW!"

07:15.805 --> 07:17.205
MEANWHILE, REPRESENTATIVE

07:17.274 --> 07:19.107
NANCY MACE -- ONE OF THE EIGHT

07:19.176 --> 07:20.174
WHO OUSTED McCARTHY -- SHOWED UP

07:20.243 --> 07:21.509
WEARING A RED "A," AND OFFERED

07:21.578 --> 07:22.877
THIS UTTERLY INCOHERENT

07:22.946 --> 07:24.579
EXPLANATION.

07:24.648 --> 07:25.680
>> I'M WEARING THE SCARLET

07:25.749 --> 07:27.315
LETTER AFTER THE WEEK THAT I

07:27.384 --> 07:28.850
JUST HAD LAST WEEK, BEING A

07:28.919 --> 07:30.284
WOMAN UP HERE AND BEING

07:30.353 --> 07:31.419
DEMONIZED FOR MY VOTE AND FOR MY

07:31.488 --> 07:32.920
VOICE.

07:32.989 --> 07:34.088
I'M HERE TO LET THE REST OF THE

07:34.157 --> 07:34.822
WORLD KNOW, AND THE COUNTRY

07:34.891 --> 07:35.389
KNOW, I'M ON THE SIDE OF THE

07:35.458 --> 07:36.557
PEOPLE.

07:36.626 --> 07:37.758
I'M NOT ON THE SIDE OF THE

07:37.827 --> 07:38.392
ESTABLISHMENT, AND I'M GOING TO

07:38.461 --> 07:39.460
DO THE RIGHT THING EVERY SINGLE

07:39.529 --> 07:40.995
TIME, NO MATTER THE

07:41.064 --> 07:42.630
CONSEQUENCES, 'CAUSE I DON'T

07:42.699 --> 07:44.198
ANSWER TO ANYBODY IN D.C., I

07:44.267 --> 07:45.600
DON'T ANSWER TO ANYONE IN

07:45.669 --> 07:47.001
WASHINGTON, I ONLY ANSWER TO THE

07:47.070 --> 07:49.103
PEOPLE.

07:49.172 --> 07:51.506
>> John: WAIT, WHAT DO YOU

07:51.575 --> 07:52.240
THINK "THE SCARLET LETTER" IS

07:52.309 --> 07:54.542
ABOUT?

07:54.611 --> 07:55.143
AND NOBODY HELP HER, LET NANCY

07:55.212 --> 07:57.445
ANSWER.

07:57.514 --> 07:58.679
I WANT TO HEAR EXACTLY WHAT SHE

07:58.748 --> 08:00.515
THINKS THE 19TH CENTURY NOVEL

08:00.584 --> 08:03.151
"THE SCARLET LETTER" IS ABOUT.

08:03.220 --> 08:04.585
DO YOU THINK HESTER PRYNNE HAD

08:04.654 --> 08:05.553
TO WEAR A SCARLET "A" BECAUSE

08:05.622 --> 08:07.421
SHE GIRLBOSSED TOO HARD FOR

08:07.490 --> 08:09.824
PURITANICAL NEW ENGLAND?

08:09.893 --> 08:11.025
I'M JUST SAYING, MAYBE READ A

08:11.094 --> 08:11.926
BOOK BEFORE YOU TRY AND COMPARE

08:11.995 --> 08:13.461
YOURSELF TO ITS PROTAGONIST.

08:13.530 --> 08:15.596
THERE'S A REASON I WOULDN'T SAY

08:15.665 --> 08:16.731
I'M LIKE CHRISTIAN GREY BECAUSE

08:16.800 --> 08:18.366
I ALSO WEAR A SUIT.

08:18.435 --> 08:20.234
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE BOOK IS

08:20.303 --> 08:22.203
ABOUT, AND, LET'S BE HONEST,

08:22.272 --> 08:24.806
THIS SUIT WEARS ME.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.374
BUT IT WASN'T JUST MACE AND

08:26.443 --> 08:28.376
SANTOS, LOTS OF MEMBERS WERE

08:28.445 --> 08:29.143
TALKING SHIT TO THE PRESS, WITH

08:29.212 --> 08:31.078
ONE COMPARING DISCUSSIONS TO "A

08:31.147 --> 08:32.647
MARRIAGE COUNSELING SESSION" AND

08:32.716 --> 08:33.648
ANOTHER LIKENING THE PARTY'S

08:33.717 --> 08:34.382
ANTICS TO THE TV SHOW

08:34.451 --> 08:36.184
"HOUSE OF CARDS."

08:36.253 --> 08:37.685
WHICH I GUESS IS TRUE IN THAT IT

08:37.754 --> 08:38.553
WAS KIND OF FUN TO WATCH AT

08:38.622 --> 08:39.320
FIRST, BUT NOW I'M JUST

08:39.389 --> 08:40.488
EXHAUSTED BY IT.

08:40.557 --> 08:41.823
THERE'S ACTUALLY ANOTHER WAY IN

08:41.892 --> 08:43.257
WHICH THIS DRAMA'S LIKE

08:43.326 --> 08:44.425
"HOUSE OF CARDS," AND IT

08:44.494 --> 08:46.494
INVOLVES SOMETHING ONE OF ITS

08:46.563 --> 08:47.895
KEY PROTAGONISTS, MATT GAETZ,

08:47.964 --> 08:49.931
HAS IN COMMON WITH KEVIN SPACEY.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.699
SADLY, MY LAWYERS TOLD ME I

08:51.768 --> 08:52.767
CAN'T SAY WHAT IT IS.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.969
BUT I CAN THINK IT.

08:55.038 --> 09:01.275
AND SO CAN ALL OF YOU.

09:01.344 --> 09:02.677
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

09:02.746 --> 09:03.244
AND TO HEAR SOME FRUSTRATED

09:03.313 --> 09:03.778
HOUSE MEMBERS TELL IT, THE

09:03.847 --> 09:04.579
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT

09:04.648 --> 09:06.647
THEIR PARTY AS A WHOLE IS NOW

09:06.716 --> 09:07.982
SET UP TO REWARD BAD BEHAVIOR.

09:08.051 --> 09:09.217
>> THESE GUYS WANT TO BE IN THE

09:09.286 --> 09:11.352
MINORITY, I THINK THEY WOULD

09:11.421 --> 09:12.520
PREFER THAT BECAUSE THEY CAN

09:12.589 --> 09:13.554
JUST VOTE NO AND YELL AND SCREAM

09:13.623 --> 09:15.189
ALL THE TIME.

09:15.258 --> 09:15.823
AND -- BUT GOVERNING, YOU'VE GOT

09:15.892 --> 09:17.592
TO WORK TOGETHER.

09:17.661 --> 09:18.526
>> IT'S A TOUGH SCENARIO, BUT

09:18.595 --> 09:19.627
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THERE THAT

09:19.696 --> 09:20.795
ARE HONORABLY TRYING TO GET TO

09:20.864 --> 09:21.662
THE RIGHT PLACE, AND THEN THERE

09:21.731 --> 09:23.297
ARE PEOPLE IN THERE, AS YOU

09:23.366 --> 09:24.365
KNOW, THAT LIKE TO GO ON THE TV

09:24.434 --> 09:26.300
AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY

09:26.369 --> 09:27.235
NEGOTIATING FOR ANYTHING OTHER

09:27.304 --> 09:28.469
THAN TV TIME.

09:28.538 --> 09:29.070
>> HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU GUYS

09:29.139 --> 09:29.704
LOOK?

09:29.773 --> 09:30.872
>> IT MAKES US LOOK LIKE A BUNCH

09:30.941 --> 09:32.406
OF IDIOTS.

09:32.475 --> 09:34.575
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE

09:34.644 --> 09:36.410
RIGHT, YOU DO LOOK LIKE IDIOTS!

09:36.479 --> 09:37.211
AND THE FACT THAT SOME OF YOUR

09:37.280 --> 09:38.112
MEMBERS ARE DRESSING LIKE THEY

09:38.181 --> 09:38.846
DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO A

09:38.915 --> 09:40.148
HALLOWEEN PARTY 20 MINUTES

09:40.217 --> 09:43.484
AGO FRANKLY ISN'T HELPING.

09:43.553 --> 09:45.286
BUT THOSE INCENTIVES THEY

09:45.355 --> 09:46.254
MENTIONED AREN'T JUST AT THE

09:46.323 --> 09:46.754
NATIONAL LEVEL.

09:46.823 --> 09:47.789
AS THE AP POINTED OUT THIS

09:47.858 --> 09:48.823
WEEK, INTERNAL CONFLICTS AND

09:48.892 --> 09:50.391
POWER STRUGGLES HAVE BECOME

09:50.460 --> 09:51.793
HALLMARKS OF THE MODERN GOP,

09:51.862 --> 09:52.360
RIGHT DOWN TO THE STATE AND

09:52.429 --> 09:55.296
LOCAL LEVELS.

09:55.365 --> 09:56.297
IN OHIO, DEMOCRATS HAD TO CROSS

09:56.366 --> 09:57.598
PARTY LINES TO END A STANDOFF

09:57.667 --> 09:58.766
OVER WHO WOULD BECOME SPEAKER OF

09:58.835 --> 09:59.600
THE HOUSE.

09:59.669 --> 10:01.202
IN TEXAS, JUST THIS WEEK, THE

10:01.271 --> 10:03.337
REPUBLICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL

10:03.406 --> 10:06.073
SUGGESTED HE'D REQUEST CRIMINAL

10:06.142 --> 10:07.375
CHARGES AGAINST MEMBERS OF HIS

10:07.444 --> 10:08.342
OWN PARTY, WHO -- INCIDENTALLY

10:08.411 --> 10:09.877
-- LED AN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL

10:09.946 --> 10:11.245
AGAINST HIM LAST MONTH.

10:11.314 --> 10:12.246
AND IN MICHIGAN, BACK IN JULY, A

10:12.315 --> 10:14.382
STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY MEETING

10:14.451 --> 10:15.883
DEVOLVED INTO VIOLENCE, WITH

10:15.952 --> 10:17.351
THIS COUNTY CHAIR GETTING INTO A

10:17.420 --> 10:19.454
BRAWL WITH A PARTY DELEGATE.

10:19.523 --> 10:20.688
>> SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM

10:20.757 --> 10:22.323
INSIDE THE HOTEL DOESN'T CAPTURE

10:22.392 --> 10:23.524
THE INITIAL ENCOUNTER, BUT IT

10:23.593 --> 10:25.326
DOES SHOW THE MELEE MOVING INTO

10:25.395 --> 10:26.394
THE HALLWAY AS DEYOUNG FALLS

10:26.463 --> 10:28.296
HARD ON HIS BACK.

10:28.365 --> 10:30.031
HE TOLD POLICE HIS DENTURES WERE

10:30.100 --> 10:31.432
DAMAGED DURING THE FRACAS.

10:31.501 --> 10:32.433
>> I LITERALLY OPENED THE DOOR,

10:32.502 --> 10:34.602
AND HE KICKED ME IN MY CROTCH.

10:34.671 --> 10:35.036
>> OKAY.

10:35.105 --> 10:35.603
>> I -- I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A

10:35.672 --> 10:36.304
SECOND.

10:36.373 --> 10:36.537
>> OKAY.

10:36.606 --> 10:38.206
>> I DIDN'T HAVE A SECOND.

10:38.275 --> 10:39.707
>> John: YEAH, HE WAS KICKED IN

10:39.776 --> 10:41.309
THE BALLS.

10:41.378 --> 10:42.210
AND I KNOW THAT'S THE

10:42.279 --> 10:44.045
EYE-CATCHING PART OF THIS STORY,

10:44.114 --> 10:45.046
BUT PLEASE DON'T SLEEP ON "HIS

10:45.115 --> 10:46.047
DENTURES WERE DAMAGED DURING THE

10:46.116 --> 10:48.349
FRACAS."

10:48.418 --> 10:49.150
WHICH I ASSUME IS SOMETHING THAT

10:49.219 --> 10:50.451
WILL BE SAID VERBATIM AFTER THE

10:50.520 --> 10:51.819
FANTASY SUITE EPISODE OF

10:51.888 --> 10:54.889
"THE GOLDEN BACHELOR."

10:54.958 --> 10:56.524
THE POINT IS, THIS SORT OF

10:56.593 --> 10:57.959
CHAOTIC REPUBLICAN INFIGHTING IS

10:58.028 --> 11:00.094
NOW A FIRMLY ENTRENCHED PATTERN.

11:00.163 --> 11:00.862
BACK IN WASHINGTON, JIM JORDAN

11:00.931 --> 11:02.597
WAS NOMINATED TO BE SPEAKER ON

11:02.666 --> 11:04.599
FRIDAY, BUT MOST PEOPLE THINK

11:04.668 --> 11:05.299
HE'S UNLIKELY TO GET THE

11:05.368 --> 11:07.535
NECESSARY VOTES, EITHER.

11:07.604 --> 11:08.569
MEANING WE'RE LEFT WITHOUT A

11:08.638 --> 11:09.170
SPEAKER, A POSITION ABSOLUTELY

11:09.239 --> 11:09.871
VITAL TO A FUNCTIONING

11:09.940 --> 11:12.940
GOVERNMENT.

11:13.009 --> 11:14.008
BUT I GUESS THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

11:14.077 --> 11:14.642
WHEN A PARTY, FOR YEARS, SIMPLY

11:14.711 --> 11:18.246
REFUSES TO KEEP ITS EXTREMIST

11:18.315 --> 11:18.946
FACTIONS IN CHECK.

11:19.015 --> 11:20.414
THE SAD FACT IS, MANY CURRENT

11:20.483 --> 11:22.517
REPUBLICANS, AT EVERY LEVEL,

11:22.586 --> 11:24.085
DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO SERVE IN

11:24.154 --> 11:25.353
GOVERNMENT AT ALL -- THEY JUST

11:25.422 --> 11:26.521
WANT TO DISMANTLE IT AND STAND

11:26.590 --> 11:29.090
ATOP THE RUBBLE FOR A TV HIT.

11:29.159 --> 11:30.725
THAT'S THE KEY REASON WHY, AS OF

11:30.794 --> 11:32.660
TAPING, ANY HOPES OF AN ORDERLY

11:32.729 --> 11:34.595
TRANSITION OF POWER FROM ONE

11:34.664 --> 11:35.897
HOUSE SPEAKER TO ANOTHER HAVE

11:35.966 --> 11:39.167
BEEN -- MUCH LIKE THIS MICHIGAN

11:39.236 --> 11:40.434
GOP COUNTY CHAIR'S TESTICLES --

11:40.503 --> 11:42.703
HUMILIATINGLY CRUSHED.

11:42.772 --> 11:46.908
AND NOW, THIS.

11:46.977 --> 11:49.210
>> Announcer: AND NOW, JIM

11:49.279 --> 11:50.044
CRAMER IS TOTALLY UNTROUBLED BY

11:50.113 --> 11:57.113
HIS HATERS.

11:58.688 --> 11:59.153
>> GETTING IT RIGHT MEANS

11:59.222 --> 12:01.122
LOGICAL DECISIONS.

12:01.191 --> 12:01.756
THAT'S TOUGH TO DO, ESPECIALLY

12:01.825 --> 12:02.390
WHEN YOU'RE DOING IN PUBLIC AS I

12:02.459 --> 12:02.990
DO, AND YOU'VE GOT A LEGION OF

12:03.059 --> 12:04.492
HATERS WHO FRANKLY WISH YOU'D

12:04.561 --> 12:04.692
QUIT.

12:04.761 --> 12:09.464
I LOVE THE HATERS.

12:09.533 --> 12:11.265
I WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS IF

12:11.334 --> 12:12.266
WEREN'T FOR THEM.

12:12.335 --> 12:14.735
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN OUT FOR THEM.

12:14.804 --> 12:15.336
I'M A SPITEFUL DRIVEN GUY TO

12:15.405 --> 12:15.937
THE HATERS AND EVERYONE IN MY

12:16.006 --> 12:16.671
PERSONAL LIFE KNOWS THAT.

12:16.740 --> 12:17.238
TO ALL THE HATERS OUT THERE

12:17.307 --> 12:17.772
FIRST OF ALL, HI, HATERS.

12:17.841 --> 12:18.239
HI, HATERS.

12:18.308 --> 12:19.240
HI, HATERS.

12:19.309 --> 12:19.907
NOW THE HATERS ARE COMING OUT OF

12:19.976 --> 12:20.808
THE WOODWORK.

12:20.877 --> 12:22.210
IN YOUR FACE, HATERS.

12:22.279 --> 12:26.080
HATERS GOING TO HATE, RIGHT?

12:26.149 --> 12:30.218
I GOT THIS ONE RIGHT.

12:30.287 --> 12:30.785
MUST HAVE JUST CRUSHED THEM.

12:30.854 --> 12:31.586
I GOT NO HATERS ANYMORE.

12:31.655 --> 12:32.220
I JUST GOT PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE

12:32.289 --> 12:32.520
ME AS MUCH.

12:32.589 --> 12:33.020
I DON'T FEAR THE HATER.

12:33.089 --> 12:33.621
PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER

12:33.690 --> 12:36.491
WAY AROUND.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.494
IF ALL I CARED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO

12:39.563 --> 12:41.929
ARE HATING ME, THEN I'D JUST BE

12:41.998 --> 12:47.602
UNDER THAT TABLE, JUST SAYING.

12:47.671 --> 12:47.969
I'D BE A LAPDOG.

12:48.038 --> 12:48.536
>> YEAH, THAT'S NOT GOING TO

12:48.605 --> 12:48.770
HAPPEN.

12:48.839 --> 12:48.970
>> NO.

12:49.039 --> 12:49.504
>> NO, YOU'D BE FEEDING ME

12:49.573 --> 12:50.071
PURINA.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.340
>> YEAH, I WOULD.

12:52.409 --> 12:53.407
>> NO, MAYBE SOME KIBBLES.

12:53.476 --> 12:56.244
>> YOU LIKE KIBBLES?

12:56.313 --> 12:58.246
>> I DO.

12:58.315 --> 12:58.880
OR MAYBE BLUE BUFF FROM GENERAL

12:58.949 --> 13:00.081
MILLS.

13:00.150 --> 13:00.515
OR CHEWY?

13:00.584 --> 13:01.382
YOU COULD PUT ME RIGHT DOWN

13:01.451 --> 13:05.553
THERE.

13:05.622 --> 13:06.087
>> LET'S GET TO AN OPENING

13:06.156 --> 13:07.121
BELL, HOW ABOUT WE DO THAT?

13:07.190 --> 13:09.457
>> OKAY, RIGHT.

13:09.526 --> 13:11.192
>> John: MOVING ON.

13:11.261 --> 13:11.926
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

13:11.995 --> 13:13.361
FOOD.

13:13.430 --> 13:14.695
WHETHER YOU'RE A VEGAN, A

13:14.764 --> 13:16.330
CARNIVORE, OR SOMEWHERE IN

13:16.399 --> 13:17.799
BETWEEN, ALL OF IT IS EITHER

13:17.868 --> 13:18.399
RIPPED FROM ITS HOME OR DIES

13:18.468 --> 13:19.433
SCREAMING.

13:19.502 --> 13:22.370
FOOD IS FUN!

13:22.439 --> 13:22.937
SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING TO

13:23.006 --> 13:26.073
TALK ABOUT FOOD SAFETY.

13:26.142 --> 13:26.707
IT'S A VITAL COMPONENT OF PUBLIC

13:26.776 --> 13:27.341
HEALTH, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THIS

13:27.410 --> 13:28.810
OLD PSA ABOUT A MILITARY BASE

13:28.879 --> 13:30.645
HAVING TO DEAL WITH AN OUTBREAK

13:30.714 --> 13:31.779
OF SALMONELLA.

13:31.848 --> 13:33.080
>> AT MIDNIGHT, ABOUT 40 OF US

13:33.149 --> 13:34.182
IN THE DUTY SECTION GOT A LIGHT

13:34.251 --> 13:35.616
MEAL.

13:35.685 --> 13:37.718
IT WAS JUST ABOUT THIS TIME THAT

13:37.787 --> 13:40.588
THINGS WERE BEGINNING TO HAPPEN.

13:40.657 --> 13:43.357
IT BEGAN LIKE THIS: AT FIRST A

13:43.426 --> 13:44.692
FEW OF THE MEN WHO WEREN'T IN

13:44.761 --> 13:47.929
THE DUTY SECTION GOT SICK.

13:47.998 --> 13:48.663
AND IT GOT STEADILY WORSE.

13:48.732 --> 13:49.497
VOMITING, ABDOMINAL PAINS, AND

13:49.566 --> 13:53.734
DIARRHEA.

13:53.803 --> 13:54.936
IT WAS HARD TO TELL WHICH CAUSED

13:55.005 --> 13:56.504
THE MOST TROUBLE.

13:56.573 --> 13:58.172
>> John: EXCEPT IT ISN'T,

13:58.241 --> 13:59.974
BECAUSE DIARRHEA CAUSES THE MOST

14:00.043 --> 14:01.576
TROUBLE.

14:01.645 --> 14:02.143
THERE'S JUST NO DOUBT ABOUT

14:02.212 --> 14:02.810
THAT.

14:02.879 --> 14:04.479
IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

14:04.548 --> 14:05.279
THOSE THREE SYMPTOMS, DIARRHEA

14:05.348 --> 14:07.682
IS DEAD LAST, EVERY SINGLE TIME.

14:07.751 --> 14:08.316
ABDOMINAL PAINS -- NOT FUN, BUT

14:08.385 --> 14:10.084
ALSO, GROW UP.

14:10.153 --> 14:10.751
SOMETIMES YOUR TUMMY HURTS;

14:10.820 --> 14:12.687
THAT'S LIFE.

14:12.756 --> 14:13.754
VOMITING -- AWFUL, BUT AT LEAST

14:13.823 --> 14:14.322
YOU CAN SOMEWHAT CONTROL THE

14:14.391 --> 14:15.823
TRAJECTORY.

14:15.892 --> 14:18.092
IT IS POSSIBLE TO DAINTILY VOMIT

14:18.161 --> 14:18.926
IN PUBLIC.

14:18.995 --> 14:20.661
BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY

14:20.730 --> 14:22.230
TO RETAIN ANY SHRED OF DIGNITY

14:22.299 --> 14:24.699
ONCE YOU HAVE SHAT YOURSELF.

14:24.768 --> 14:26.033
IT'S GAME OVER.

14:26.102 --> 14:27.468
YOU CAN'T COME BACK FROM THAT.

14:27.537 --> 14:28.536
YOU'RE BASICALLY AN ANIMAL, YOU

14:28.605 --> 14:31.305
LIVE AT THE ZOO NOW.

14:31.374 --> 14:33.074
ODDS ARE, YOU'VE PROBABLY

14:33.143 --> 14:33.875
EXPERIENCED GETTING SICK FROM

14:33.944 --> 14:35.510
FOOD AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIFE,

14:35.579 --> 14:37.278
BECAUSE IT HAPPENS A LOT.

14:37.347 --> 14:39.614
EVERY YEAR, AN ESTIMATED 46

14:39.683 --> 14:40.214
MILLION AMERICANS ARE SICKENED

14:40.283 --> 14:41.015
BY FOODBORNE ILLNESS, AND OF

14:41.084 --> 14:43.551
THEM, 128,000 ARE HOSPITALIZED,

14:43.620 --> 14:45.887
AND ABOUT 3,000 DIE.

14:45.956 --> 14:47.088
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S IN THE

14:47.157 --> 14:47.855
PUBLIC INTEREST TO TRY AND

14:47.924 --> 14:49.357
PREVENT ANY OF THAT FROM

14:49.426 --> 14:51.159
HAPPENING -- WHICH IS WHY, SO

14:51.228 --> 14:52.727
OFTEN, YOU'LL TURN ON THE TV AND

14:52.796 --> 14:54.228
SEE STORIES LIKE THESE.

14:54.297 --> 14:55.263
>> KRAFT HEINZ HAS VOLUNTARILY

14:55.332 --> 14:55.997
RECALLED 7,000 CASES OF

14:56.066 --> 14:57.632
TACO BELL SALSA CON QUESO MILD

14:57.701 --> 14:58.166
CHEESE DIP OUT OF BOTULISM

14:58.235 --> 15:01.702
CONCERNS.

15:01.771 --> 15:02.336
>> AN EXPANDED RECALL OF PEACHES

15:02.405 --> 15:05.973
LINKED TO A SALMONELLA OUTBREAK.

15:06.042 --> 15:06.541
>> SEVERAL JIF PEANUT BUTTER

15:06.610 --> 15:07.141
PRODUCTS ARE BEING PULLED FROM

15:07.210 --> 15:11.245
THE SHELVES.

15:11.314 --> 15:11.779
>> STORES CANNOT SELL THIS

15:11.848 --> 15:12.380
CEREAL LEGALLY BECAUSE OF THIS

15:12.449 --> 15:13.614
RECALL.

15:13.683 --> 15:14.982
SO, IF YOU HAVE THE HONEY SMACKS

15:15.051 --> 15:15.750
IN YOUR PANTRY, PLEASE THROW IT

15:15.819 --> 15:19.320
OUT.

15:19.389 --> 15:19.954
>> John: OKAY, COUPLE OF THINGS

15:20.023 --> 15:20.488
THERE -- ON THE FIRST ONE,

15:20.557 --> 15:21.055
HONESTLY, I'D ALWAYS ASSUMED

15:21.124 --> 15:22.523
THAT ALL TACO BELL JARRED

15:22.592 --> 15:23.224
PRODUCTS COULD GIVE YOU

15:23.293 --> 15:25.860
BOTULISM.

15:25.929 --> 15:26.661
YOU WANT THE SPICE, YOU ROLL THE

15:26.730 --> 15:30.665
DICE.

15:30.734 --> 15:31.199
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT.

15:31.268 --> 15:32.400
AND AS FOR "THROW OUT YOUR HONEY

15:32.469 --> 15:32.967
SMACKS," THAT'S PRETTY GOOD

15:33.036 --> 15:36.170
ADVICE EVEN WHEN THERE'S NOT A

15:36.239 --> 15:36.737
RECALL, BECAUSE LOOK AT THIS

15:36.806 --> 15:37.405
SHIT.

15:37.474 --> 15:38.206
IT LOOKS LIKE MAGGOTS GLAZED

15:38.275 --> 15:39.640
WITH SUGAR.

15:39.709 --> 15:40.274
AND THAT'S WITHOUT GETTING INTO

15:40.343 --> 15:40.575
THE MASCOT.

15:40.644 --> 15:42.743
WHO IS THIS?

15:42.812 --> 15:43.344
CEREAL MASCOTS ARE SUPPOSED TO

15:43.413 --> 15:44.278
BE CHARMING, WHETHER THEY'RE A

15:44.347 --> 15:45.780
CULTURAL STEREOTYPE THAT THIS

15:45.849 --> 15:47.215
ACCENT DOESN'T GET TO ENJOY, OR

15:47.284 --> 15:47.815
AN INAPPROPRIATELY SEXY TIGER,

15:47.884 --> 15:50.585
BUT THIS?

15:50.654 --> 15:52.286
THIS IS NOTHING.

15:52.355 --> 15:53.387
WHY DOES YOUR SHIRT SAY "DIG

15:53.456 --> 15:53.588
'EM?"

15:53.657 --> 15:54.088
DIG WHAT?

15:54.157 --> 15:55.723
THE HONEY SMACKS?

15:55.792 --> 15:56.991
ABSOLUTELY NOT, YOU AMPHIBIAN

15:57.060 --> 15:59.060
PERVERT.

15:59.129 --> 16:00.561
AND LOOK, WHEN YOU SEE STORIES

16:00.630 --> 16:01.929
LIKE THOSE, YOU'D ASSUME THAT

16:01.998 --> 16:03.297
THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSTANTLY ON

16:03.366 --> 16:04.499
THE LOOKOUT FOR POTENTIALLY

16:04.568 --> 16:05.700
DANGEROUS FOOD.

16:05.769 --> 16:07.201
BUT IT'S BECOME INCREASINGLY

16:07.270 --> 16:08.703
CLEAR THAT OUR FOOD SAFETY

16:08.772 --> 16:09.437
SYSTEM -- IN PARTICULAR, THE

16:09.506 --> 16:11.172
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION,

16:11.241 --> 16:12.807
WHICH OVERSEES MOST OF IT -- HAS

16:12.876 --> 16:16.043
SOME SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS.

16:16.112 --> 16:17.411
IN 2016, AN AUDIT DONE BY THE

16:17.480 --> 16:18.946
AGENCY ITSELF FOUND UNACCEPTABLE

16:19.015 --> 16:21.082
DELAYS IN GETTING DANGEROUS FOOD

16:21.151 --> 16:21.816
OFF THE SHELVES -- FINDING THAT

16:21.885 --> 16:22.683
IN 30 RECALLS, IT TOOK AN

16:22.752 --> 16:25.887
AVERAGE OF 57 DAYS FROM WHEN THE

16:25.956 --> 16:28.289
FDA WAS NOTIFIED.

16:28.358 --> 16:29.490
AND THE AUTHOR OF THAT REPORT

16:29.559 --> 16:30.057
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WAS A BIG

16:30.126 --> 16:31.659
PROBLEM.

16:31.728 --> 16:33.528
>> UNLESS YOU GET ALL THE

16:33.597 --> 16:34.128
PRODUCT OFF THE SHELF, PEOPLE

16:34.197 --> 16:40.768
STILL ARE AT RISK.

16:40.837 --> 16:41.302
IF YOU ARE PLAYING RUSSIAN

16:41.371 --> 16:41.836
ROULETTE, YOU TOOK ALL THE

16:41.905 --> 16:42.437
BULLETS OUT OF THE GUN AND YOU

16:42.506 --> 16:43.037
PUT IT TO YOUR HEAD THERE'S NO

16:43.106 --> 16:43.237
RISK.

16:43.306 --> 16:43.871
BUT IF THERE'S STILL A COUPLE OF

16:43.940 --> 16:44.472
BULLETS LEFT IN THERE, YOU'RE

16:44.541 --> 16:45.106
STILL PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE,

16:45.175 --> 16:45.706
AREN'T YOU?

16:45.775 --> 16:46.240
>> John: WOW, THAT IS AN

16:46.309 --> 16:46.974
ALARMINGLY APT METAPHOR FOR THE

16:47.043 --> 16:47.508
CURRENT SAFETY OF OUR FOOD

16:47.577 --> 16:53.314
SUPPLY.

16:53.383 --> 16:53.948
ALTHOUGH, REAL QUICK, IF YOU'RE

16:54.017 --> 16:54.582
PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE AND YOU

16:54.651 --> 16:55.650
TAKE ALL THE BULLETS OUT OF THE

16:55.719 --> 16:59.187
GUN, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH: YOU

16:59.256 --> 16:59.787
ARE NO LONGER PLAYING RUSSIAN

16:59.856 --> 17:02.990
ROULETTE.

17:03.059 --> 17:04.425
YOU'RE IN A COMMUNITY THEATER

17:04.494 --> 17:06.060
PRODUCTION OF THE SEAGULL.

17:06.129 --> 17:06.661
I HAD TO LEAVE AT INTERMISSION

17:06.730 --> 17:07.462
BUT YOU WERE SO GOOD.

17:07.531 --> 17:08.029
AND YOU MIGHT REMEMBER, THE

17:08.098 --> 17:09.764
FDA'S SHORTCOMINGS WERE BADLY

17:09.833 --> 17:10.398
EXPOSED LAST YEAR, WHEN ABBOTT,

17:10.467 --> 17:11.632
A COMPANY THAT MAKES 40% OF THIS

17:11.701 --> 17:13.935
COUNTRY'S BABY FORMULA, SHUT

17:14.004 --> 17:14.535
DOWN ITS FACTORY OVER SERIOUS

17:14.604 --> 17:19.907
SAFETY VIOLATIONS -- VIOLATIONS

17:19.976 --> 17:20.541
THE FDA CLEARLY SHOULD'VE ACTED

17:20.610 --> 17:20.908
ON MUCH SOONER.

17:20.977 --> 17:23.411
>> A SIGN OF TROUBLE CAME LAST

17:23.480 --> 17:23.978
SEPTEMBER IN A REPORT TO THE

17:24.047 --> 17:28.950
FDA, AN INFANT WHO BECAME ILL

17:29.019 --> 17:29.584
WITH A RARE BACTERIAL INFECTION

17:29.653 --> 17:30.985
HAD CONSUMED FORMULA MADE AT THE

17:31.054 --> 17:33.354
ABBOTT PLANT.

17:33.423 --> 17:34.388
IN OCTOBER, AN ABBOTT

17:34.457 --> 17:35.022
WHISTLEBLOWER SENT FDA OFFICIALS

17:35.091 --> 17:37.692
THIS 34-PAGE DOCUMENT ALLEGING

17:37.761 --> 17:40.128
THAT LAX PRACTICES INCLUDING

17:40.197 --> 17:40.661
REGULATORY VIOLATIONS WERE

17:40.730 --> 17:44.565
CONSISTENTLY OVERLOOKED.

17:44.634 --> 17:46.968
IT WASN'T UNTIL JANUARY 31ST

17:47.037 --> 17:48.970
THAT THE FDA SENT A TEAM TO THE

17:49.039 --> 17:51.139
ABBOTT FACILITY TO INVESTIGATE.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.241
THERE THEY FOUND EVIDENCE OF

17:53.310 --> 17:53.841
BACTERIA IN A POWDERED INFANT

17:53.910 --> 17:55.676
FORMULA ENVIRONMENT THAT CAN BE

17:55.745 --> 17:57.879
DEADLY TO INFANTS.

17:57.948 --> 17:59.080
>> John: IT'S TRUE, THE FDA TOOK

17:59.149 --> 18:00.848
FOUR MONTHS FROM THEIR FIRST

18:00.917 --> 18:02.283
SIGN SOMETHING WAS WRONG TO DO A

18:02.352 --> 18:03.718
FOLLOW-UP INSPECTION.

18:03.787 --> 18:05.720
AND AT THAT POINT, AT LEAST FOUR

18:05.789 --> 18:06.320
BABIES HAD BEEN HOSPITALIZED,

18:06.389 --> 18:08.055
AND TWO DIED.

18:08.124 --> 18:09.490
EVEN AN INTERNAL FDA REPORT

18:09.559 --> 18:10.591
AFTERWARDS CONCLUDED THE AGENCY

18:10.660 --> 18:12.326
HAD "SYSTEMIC VULNERABILITIES,"

18:12.395 --> 18:13.761
AND A MUCH MORE SCATHING OUTSIDE

18:13.830 --> 18:14.362
AUDIT FAULTED THEM FOR LACK OF

18:14.431 --> 18:18.065
COMMUNICATION AND ENGAGEMENT

18:18.134 --> 18:19.467
ACROSS THE AGENCY.

18:19.536 --> 18:20.168
BUT THE TRUTH IS, "SCATHING

18:20.237 --> 18:22.303
REPORT FINDS FAULT WITH THE FDA"

18:22.372 --> 18:24.172
IS JUST NOT A NEW STORY.

18:24.241 --> 18:27.175
IT'S HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN

18:27.244 --> 18:28.042
AND AGAIN.

18:28.111 --> 18:28.676
YOU CAN FIND SIMILAR REPORTS IN

18:28.745 --> 18:29.277
2010, 1991, AND EVEN THIS ONE,

18:29.346 --> 18:33.714
FROM BACK IN 1969.

18:33.783 --> 18:37.385
>> THE AMERICAN CONSUMER IS

18:37.454 --> 18:37.952
SURROUNDED BY AN ARSENAL OF

18:38.021 --> 18:42.690
PRODUCTS WHICH CAN KILL OR MAIM

18:42.759 --> 18:43.024
HIM.

18:43.093 --> 18:43.458
AND THE FOOD & DRUG

18:43.527 --> 18:44.058
ADMINISTRATION HAS NEITHER THE

18:44.127 --> 18:44.659
MONEY NOR THE AUTHORITY TO DO

18:44.728 --> 18:44.992
MUCH ABOUT IT.

18:45.061 --> 18:45.426
THAT'S THE GIST OF A

18:45.495 --> 18:48.095
CONFIDENTIAL REPORT PREPARED BY

18:48.164 --> 18:52.233
SEVEN SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE FDA.

18:52.302 --> 18:52.867
>> John: THAT'S WALTER CRONKITE

18:52.936 --> 18:55.403
FLAGGING THE STATE OF THE FDA AS

18:55.472 --> 18:55.937
A SERIOUS PROBLEM, HALF A

18:56.006 --> 18:58.973
CENTURY AGO.

18:59.042 --> 18:59.774
AND IF SOMETHING HE REPORTED ON

18:59.843 --> 19:00.341
IS STILL AN ISSUE, YOU KNOW

19:00.410 --> 19:01.709
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

19:01.778 --> 19:02.710
I'M JUST SAYING, IF JFK WAS

19:02.779 --> 19:04.178
STILL REGULARLY GETTING SHOT IN

19:04.247 --> 19:06.881
DALLAS, YOU'D REALLY HOPE

19:06.950 --> 19:07.915
SOMEBODY WOULD'VE DONE SOMETHING

19:07.984 --> 19:09.851
ABOUT IT BY NOW.

19:09.920 --> 19:10.485
SO GIVEN WE'VE KNOWN THE WAY THE

19:10.554 --> 19:14.422
FDA REGULATES FOOD IS SOME

19:14.491 --> 19:15.022
VERSION OF FUCKED FOR DECADES,

19:15.091 --> 19:15.556
TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

19:15.625 --> 19:18.793
EXACTLY WHY THAT IS, AND WHY

19:18.862 --> 19:20.027
IT'S BEEN SO HARD TO FIX.

19:20.096 --> 19:20.728
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

19:20.797 --> 19:21.395
THAT -- DESPITE THE FDA STANDING

19:21.464 --> 19:21.796
FOR "FOOD AND DRUG

19:21.865 --> 19:25.666
ADMINISTRATION" -- THE TWO PARTS

19:25.735 --> 19:26.267
OF THAT ARE NOT GIVEN REMOTELY

19:26.336 --> 19:28.636
EQUAL WEIGHT.

19:28.705 --> 19:30.138
DRUGS ARE PRIORITIZED HEAVILY.

19:30.207 --> 19:30.772
FDA COMMISSIONERS ALMOST ALWAYS

19:30.841 --> 19:31.405
COME FROM THE MEDICAL SIDE, AND

19:31.474 --> 19:32.039
HAVE ALMOST NO EXPERIENCE WITH

19:32.108 --> 19:37.945
FOOD ISSUES.

19:38.014 --> 19:38.412
AND APPARENTLY, IT'S A

19:38.481 --> 19:38.980
LONG-RUNNING JOKE AMONG FDA

19:39.049 --> 19:39.614
OFFICIALS THAT THE "F" IN "FDA"

19:39.683 --> 19:43.317
IS SILENT.

19:43.386 --> 19:43.851
IN FACT, ITS OWN STAFF --

19:43.920 --> 19:44.485
INCLUDING SOME FDA COMMISSIONERS

19:44.554 --> 19:46.521
-- HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO SLIP UP

19:46.590 --> 19:47.121
AND CALL IT THE FEDERAL DRUG

19:47.190 --> 19:50.625
ADMINISTRATION.

19:50.694 --> 19:50.958
AND, COME ON.

19:51.027 --> 19:53.494
THERE'S ONLY TWO THINGS TO

19:53.563 --> 19:54.095
REMEMBER IN THE NAME: FOOD AND

19:54.164 --> 19:57.031
DRUGS.

19:57.100 --> 19:57.899
IF YOU NEED A HELPFUL MNEMONIC

19:57.968 --> 19:59.500
FOR IT, JUST REMEMBER THIS

19:59.569 --> 20:00.401
SIMPLE PHRASE: "FOOD AND DRUGS."

20:00.470 --> 20:07.341
IT'S TWO FUCKING WORDS.

20:07.410 --> 20:07.909
ALSO, INTERESTINGLY, THE FDA

20:07.978 --> 20:08.476
DOESN'T ACTUALLY OVERSEE THE

20:08.545 --> 20:09.110
SAFETY OF ALL FOOD IN THE U.S.

20:09.179 --> 20:09.944
IT OVERSEES AROUND 80% OF IT,

20:10.013 --> 20:10.545
BUT THE REMAINING 20% LARGELY

20:10.614 --> 20:13.481
FALLS UNDER THE USDA'S FOOD

20:13.550 --> 20:14.081
SAFETY AND INSPECTION SERVICE.

20:14.150 --> 20:16.284
AND THE DIVISION OF

20:16.353 --> 20:18.186
RESPONSIBILITIES CAN GET

20:18.255 --> 20:18.686
MADDENINGLY COMPLICATED.

20:18.755 --> 20:19.353
WHILE BROADLY, THE USDA OVERSEES

20:19.422 --> 20:22.824
BEEF, POULTRY, AND SOME EGG

20:22.893 --> 20:29.893
PRODUCTS, AND THE FDA OVERSEES

20:32.802 --> 20:33.367
THE REST, IN PRACTICE, WHERE THE

20:33.436 --> 20:34.068
EXACT LINES GETS DRAWN CAN GET

20:34.137 --> 20:34.368
RIDICULOUS.

20:34.437 --> 20:34.869
>> TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

20:34.938 --> 20:35.436
BEEF BROTH, MADE IN A PLANT

20:35.505 --> 20:38.973
REGULATED BY THE USDA, WHICH

20:39.042 --> 20:39.607
INSPECTS EVERY DAY.

20:39.676 --> 20:40.975
BUT CHICKEN BROTH, MADE IN A

20:41.044 --> 20:43.411
PLANT REGULATED BY THE FDA,

20:43.480 --> 20:45.012
WHICH IS INSPECTED ONCE EVERY 5

20:45.081 --> 20:48.382
YEARS.

20:48.451 --> 20:49.016
IN THE FROZEN FOOD AISLE, CHEESE

20:49.085 --> 20:50.751
PIZZA IS REGULATED BY THE FDA.

20:50.820 --> 20:52.553
PEPPERONI PIZZA?

20:52.622 --> 20:54.655
WELL, THAT'S THE USDA.

20:54.724 --> 20:55.990
THE FISH?

20:56.059 --> 20:57.225
WELL, THAT'S FDA,

20:57.294 --> 20:58.192
EXCEPT ONE, CATFISH, THAT'S

20:58.261 --> 21:00.761
USDA.

21:00.830 --> 21:01.295
>> John: YEAH, IT'S PRETTY

21:01.364 --> 21:03.131
CONFUSING.

21:03.200 --> 21:03.698
IT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO

21:03.767 --> 21:05.333
GUESS WHICH AGENCY OVERSEES

21:05.402 --> 21:06.901
WHICH KINDS OF FOOD.

21:06.970 --> 21:07.435
FOR EXAMPLE, EGGS IN THEIR

21:07.504 --> 21:07.835
SHELLS?

21:07.904 --> 21:09.070
FDA.

21:09.139 --> 21:10.037
EGGS PROCESSED INTO EGG

21:10.106 --> 21:11.372
PRODUCTS?

21:11.441 --> 21:12.273
USDA.

21:12.342 --> 21:12.874
THE FEED THAT EGG-LAYING HENS

21:12.943 --> 21:13.941
EAT?

21:14.010 --> 21:15.443
FDA AGAIN.

21:15.512 --> 21:17.011
OPEN-FACED MEAT SANDWICH?

21:17.080 --> 21:17.879
USDA, BUT CLOSED-FACED MEAT

21:17.948 --> 21:19.380
SANDWICH?

21:19.449 --> 21:22.450
THAT'S FDA.

21:22.519 --> 21:24.886
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW, IF YOU MAKE

21:24.955 --> 21:25.453
A HALF CHEESE HALF PEPPERONI

21:25.522 --> 21:26.020
PIZZA AND THEN PUT AN EGG ON

21:26.089 --> 21:26.888
TOP, THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT

21:26.957 --> 21:33.957
ACTUALLY EXPLODES.

21:34.231 --> 21:34.629
AND THE THING IS, THAT

21:34.698 --> 21:38.065
FRACTURED STRUCTURE CAN CREATE

21:38.134 --> 21:40.568
A LOT OF CRACKS FOR PROBLEMS TO

21:40.637 --> 21:40.935
FALL INTO.

21:41.004 --> 21:41.502
THEN, THERE ARE THE FUNDING

21:41.571 --> 21:42.270
ISSUES.

21:42.339 --> 21:45.540
BECAUSE DESPITE THE FACT THE FDA

21:45.609 --> 21:46.574
OVERSEES, REMEMBER, 80% OF FOOD

21:46.643 --> 21:47.241
-- THEY AND THE USDA RECEIVE

21:47.310 --> 21:48.843
CLOSE TO THE SAME AMOUNT OF

21:48.912 --> 21:49.343
FUNDING FOR FOOD SAFETY

21:49.412 --> 21:53.881
OVERSIGHT.

21:53.950 --> 21:54.515
MEANING THE FDA ESSENTIALLY HAS

21:54.584 --> 21:55.149
TO MAKE THE SAME BUDGET GO FOUR

21:55.218 --> 21:56.551
TIMES AS FAR.

21:56.620 --> 21:57.185
ON TOP OF THAT, THE FDA'S JOB IS

21:57.254 --> 21:58.820
MUCH MORE COMPLEX.

21:58.889 --> 21:59.454
BECAUSE WHILE THE USDA'S WORK IS

21:59.523 --> 21:59.921
CONCENTRATED IN LARGE

21:59.990 --> 22:02.924
MEAT-PROCESSING PLANTS -- OF

22:02.993 --> 22:03.524
WHICH WE HAVE RELATIVELY FEW,

22:03.593 --> 22:08.329
AROUND 800 -- THE FDA'S PURVIEW

22:08.398 --> 22:10.531
INCLUDES ABOUT 35,000 PRODUCE

22:10.600 --> 22:14.869
FARMS, 300,000 RESTAURANT CHAIN

22:14.938 --> 22:16.938
ESTABLISHMENTS, 10,500 VENDING

22:17.007 --> 22:19.006
MACHINE OPERATORS, AND ROUGHLY

22:19.075 --> 22:19.507
275,000 FOOD PROCESSING

22:19.576 --> 22:21.809
FACILITIES, MORE THAN HALF OF

22:21.878 --> 22:22.677
WHICH ARE OVERSEAS.

22:22.746 --> 22:23.478
VERY BASICALLY, THE FDA IS

22:23.547 --> 22:24.078
SPREAD EXTREMELY THIN, AND THE

22:24.147 --> 22:30.852
USDA ISN'T.

22:30.921 --> 22:31.385
AND THIS DISCREPANCY HELPS

22:31.454 --> 22:31.953
EXPLAIN A SHOCKING FACT THAT

22:32.022 --> 22:32.553
CAME TO LIGHT AFTER THAT BABY

22:32.622 --> 22:34.388
FORMULA INCIDENT LAST YEAR,

22:34.457 --> 22:35.990
REGARDING THE SIZE OF THE FDA

22:36.059 --> 22:36.757
TEAM THAT'S TASKED WITH

22:36.826 --> 22:41.028
OVERSEEING THOSE PARTICULAR

22:41.097 --> 22:41.295
FACTORIES.

22:41.364 --> 22:41.896
>> IT'S A TOTAL OF NINE PEOPLE

22:41.965 --> 22:44.732
WHO ARE FOCUSED ON INFANT

22:44.801 --> 22:45.333
FORMULA, AT THE FDA, AND THE

22:45.402 --> 22:46.300
BUDGET.

22:46.369 --> 22:46.934
WE GOT AN ADDITIONAL FOUR PEOPLE

22:47.003 --> 22:49.637
ALLOCATED LAST YEAR.

22:49.706 --> 22:50.204
BUT WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE

22:50.273 --> 22:51.539
THAN THAT.

22:51.608 --> 22:52.206
>> John: THAT'S TRUE, THE ENTIRE

22:52.275 --> 22:53.574
DEPARTMENT OVERSEEING INFANT

22:53.643 --> 22:54.175
FORMULA WAS JUST NINE PEOPLE!

22:54.244 --> 22:59.180
AND THAT IS NOT ENOUGH!

22:59.249 --> 22:59.814
FOR CONTEXT, THIS SHOW HAS FOUR

22:59.883 --> 23:00.248
INTERNS.

23:00.317 --> 23:02.550
AND WE NEED ALL OF THEM!

23:02.619 --> 23:04.252
BUT THE STAKES OF THEIR JOBS ARE

23:04.321 --> 23:05.019
JUST NOT NEARLY AS HIGH.

23:05.088 --> 23:06.954
THEIR ONLY LIFE-OR-DEATH DUTY IS

23:07.023 --> 23:08.389
MAKING SURE MR. NUTTERBUTTER

23:08.458 --> 23:10.091
DOESN'T GET OUT OF HIS CAGE.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.226
OH, SHIT, OH, SHIT.

23:12.295 --> 23:14.262
EVERYBODY STAY INCREDIBLY STILL.

23:14.331 --> 23:18.299
SO CLEARLY, SOME OF THE FDA'S

23:18.368 --> 23:18.933
ISSUES COME FROM WITHOUT, IN HOW

23:19.002 --> 23:21.869
IT'S STRUCTURED AND FUNDED.

23:21.938 --> 23:22.670
BUT SOME OF ITS PROBLEMS COME

23:22.739 --> 23:23.271
FROM WITHIN -- LIKE THE FACT

23:23.340 --> 23:24.572
THAT EVEN BY GOVERNMENT

23:24.641 --> 23:25.840
STANDARDS, IT HAS AN INFAMOUSLY

23:25.909 --> 23:26.941
SLOW BUREAUCRACY.

23:27.010 --> 23:28.009
TAKE, FOR INSTANCE, THIS VERY

23:28.078 --> 23:28.943
SPECIFIC ANNOUNCEMENT THEY MADE

23:29.012 --> 23:31.112
AT THE END OF 2020.

23:31.181 --> 23:31.746
>> A SHAKEUP FOR FRENCH DRESSING

23:31.815 --> 23:33.080
FANS.

23:33.149 --> 23:33.714
THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

23:33.783 --> 23:36.951
IS PROPOSING REMOVING INGREDIENT

23:37.020 --> 23:37.485
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SALAD

23:37.554 --> 23:40.788
DRESSING AT THE REQUEST OF THE

23:40.857 --> 23:41.389
ASSOCIATION FOR DRESSINGS AND

23:41.458 --> 23:42.590
SAUCES.

23:42.659 --> 23:43.224
RIGHT NOW, DRESSING MUST INCLUDE

23:43.293 --> 23:44.525
VINEGAR, OIL, AND LEMON OR LIME

23:44.594 --> 23:50.164
IN ORDER TO BE CALLED "FRENCH."

23:50.233 --> 23:50.932
>> John: NOW, I KNOW THAT WAS

23:51.001 --> 23:51.365
ABOUT AN FDA RULING.

23:51.434 --> 23:51.999
BUT THE ONLY THING I'M THINKING

23:52.068 --> 23:53.367
ABOUT AFTER WATCHING THAT CLIP

23:53.436 --> 23:54.001
IS THE ASSOCIATION FOR DRESSINGS

23:54.070 --> 23:57.205
AND SAUCES.

23:57.274 --> 23:57.805
I NOW WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING

23:57.874 --> 23:58.506
ABOUT THEM.

23:58.575 --> 23:59.140
I'M GUESSING RANCH AND BARBECUE

23:59.209 --> 23:59.974
SAUCE ARE THE HEAVYWEIGHTS

24:00.043 --> 24:00.741
THERE.

24:00.810 --> 24:02.176
MAYO TOO, OBVIOUSLY.

24:02.245 --> 24:02.743
AND THERE'S PROBABLY TURMOIL

24:02.812 --> 24:04.278
OVER THE HOT YOUNG NEWCOMERS:

24:04.347 --> 24:06.114
TRUFFLE KETCHUP, GREEN GODDESS

24:06.183 --> 24:07.448
DRESSING, ALL THE FLASHY STUFF.

24:07.517 --> 24:10.885
I GET IT.

24:10.954 --> 24:11.752
BUT WHO DO YOU THINK THE BLACK

24:11.821 --> 24:13.321
SHEEP OF THE ORGANIZATION ARE?

24:13.390 --> 24:13.688
WORCESTERSHIRE?

24:13.757 --> 24:14.589
MAYBE SOME OF THE MORE FUCKED UP

24:14.658 --> 24:16.157
MUSTARDS?

24:16.226 --> 24:17.592
THIS IS THE ONLY THING I'M

24:17.661 --> 24:18.960
INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT NOW.

24:19.029 --> 24:19.560
JUST KNOW, ANYTIME I'M TALKING

24:19.629 --> 24:21.295
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE, 90% OF MY

24:21.364 --> 24:21.896
BRAIN IS STILL FOCUSED ON THE

24:21.965 --> 24:22.497
ASSOCIATION FOR DRESSINGS AND

24:22.566 --> 24:26.134
SAUCES.

24:26.203 --> 24:27.401
BUT THE POINT OF SHOWING YOU

24:27.470 --> 24:28.002
THAT CLIP IS THAT THE FDA MADE

24:28.071 --> 24:28.636
THAT ANNOUNCEMENT AT THE END OF

24:28.705 --> 24:29.737
2020, AFTER MY NEW FAVORITE

24:29.806 --> 24:30.338
TRADE GROUP ASKED THEM TO DO

24:30.407 --> 24:33.274
SOMETHING ABOUT THE DEFINITION

24:33.343 --> 24:34.909
OF FRENCH DRESSING, BACK IN --

24:34.978 --> 24:38.613
AND THIS IS TRUE -- 1998.

24:38.682 --> 24:39.180
AND WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED THE

24:39.249 --> 24:39.714
DECISION, THEY DIDN'T EVEN

24:39.783 --> 24:40.882
EXPLAIN WHY IT TOOK THEM MORE

24:40.951 --> 24:43.184
THAN TWO DECADES -- SPANNING ONE

24:43.253 --> 24:44.585
9/11, AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE

24:44.654 --> 24:46.220
SPICE GIRLS -- TO ARRIVE AT THAT

24:46.289 --> 24:48.589
DECISION.

24:48.658 --> 24:49.223
BUT ALL OF THIS DYSFUNCTION HAS

24:49.292 --> 24:51.559
REAL CONSEQUENCES.

24:51.628 --> 24:52.560
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST BABY

24:52.629 --> 24:53.194
FORMULA OR HONEY SMACKS THAT CAN

24:53.263 --> 24:55.997
CAUSE ILLNESS.

24:56.066 --> 24:56.397
ONE OF THE BIGGEST

24:56.466 --> 24:57.598
VULNERABILITIES IN OUR CURRENT

24:57.667 --> 24:58.232
SYSTEM ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH

24:58.301 --> 25:00.501
LEAFY GREENS.

25:00.570 --> 25:02.804
THEY'RE OVERSEEN BY THE FDA, AND

25:02.873 --> 25:03.571
ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF FOOD

25:03.640 --> 25:05.339
CONTAMINATION.

25:05.408 --> 25:06.207
AND ONE OF THE KEY REASONS FOR

25:06.276 --> 25:08.009
THAT IS THAT LARGE INDUSTRIAL

25:08.078 --> 25:09.644
FARMS HAVE BECOME MORE COMMON,

25:09.713 --> 25:10.278
WITH LIVESTOCK RAISED EXTREMELY

25:10.347 --> 25:12.113
CLOSE TO WHERE CROPS ARE BEING

25:12.182 --> 25:14.849
GROWN, AND SOMETIMES EVEN

25:14.918 --> 25:17.552
SHARING A WATER SOURCE.

25:17.621 --> 25:19.320
AND THAT -- AS THIS EXPERT

25:19.389 --> 25:21.889
EXPLAINS -- CAN BE A REAL ISSUE.

25:21.958 --> 25:22.523
>> HOW WE RAISE ANIMALS CAN FUEL

25:22.592 --> 25:26.294
THE GROWTH OF THESE BUGS.

25:26.363 --> 25:26.861
SO, IF WE CROWD THE ANIMALS

25:26.930 --> 25:29.130
TOGETHER AND YOU HAVE ONE THAT'S

25:29.199 --> 25:29.730
CARRYING A REALLY BAD PATHOGEN

25:29.799 --> 25:32.066
LIKE E. COLI O157, THEN THEY CAN

25:32.135 --> 25:32.633
POOP THOSE BACTERIA OUT, AND

25:32.702 --> 25:37.071
THEN THE SHIT FROM THE CATTLE

25:37.140 --> 25:37.705
WASHES OFF INTO THE -- INTO THE

25:37.774 --> 25:44.774
STREAMS OR INTO CANALS,

25:45.182 --> 25:45.513
IRRIGATION CANALS.

25:45.582 --> 25:48.716
AND THEN THOSE CAN BE USED TO

25:48.785 --> 25:49.684
WATER THESE PLANTS.

25:49.753 --> 25:50.351
WE HAVE THIS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM

25:50.420 --> 25:51.452
FOR THESE PATHOGENS FROM ANIMALS

25:51.521 --> 25:53.888
TO PRODUCE.

25:53.957 --> 25:54.522
>> John: NOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF

25:54.591 --> 25:55.356
EXCELLENT PRODUCTION CHOICES IN

25:55.425 --> 25:57.358
THAT DOCUMENTARY, INCLUDING

25:57.427 --> 25:58.893
DECIDING TO BOTH CINEMATICALLY

25:58.962 --> 26:01.329
SHOOT A COW SHITTING, AND ALLOW

26:01.398 --> 26:03.464
SOMEONE TO SAY THE WORD "SHIT."

26:03.533 --> 26:04.499
I SUPPORT THAT CHOICE.

26:04.568 --> 26:06.100
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR LITTLE

26:06.169 --> 26:09.804
PLEASANTRIES LIKE "FECES" AND

26:09.873 --> 26:10.371
"MANURE," BUT IT'S COW SHIT!

26:10.440 --> 26:10.805
CALL IT WHAT IT IS.

26:10.874 --> 26:12.206
WE KNOW IT WHEN WE SEE IT, IF

26:12.275 --> 26:13.908
NOT ALWAYS WHEN WE EAT IT.

26:13.977 --> 26:15.943
BUT THE POINT IS, THAT SHIT CAN

26:16.012 --> 26:17.178
GO FROM THE ANIMALS, INTO WATER,

26:17.247 --> 26:19.080
WHICH IS THEN SPRAYED DIRECTLY

26:19.149 --> 26:21.249
ONTO THE LETTUCE.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.117
AND GIVEN THE GROWTH IN BOXED

26:23.186 --> 26:24.919
AND BAGGED SALADS, JUST ONE HEAD

26:24.988 --> 26:25.553
OF CONTAMINATED LETTUCE CAN GET

26:25.622 --> 26:26.821
SPREAD OUT ACROSS A LOT OF

26:26.890 --> 26:30.091
PEOPLE.

26:30.160 --> 26:30.691
AND WHILE, WITH MEAT, YOU CAN

26:30.760 --> 26:34.395
KILL OFF A LOT OF THE PATHOGENS

26:34.464 --> 26:34.929
SIMPLY THROUGH THE ACT OF

26:34.998 --> 26:35.229
COOKING IT.

26:35.298 --> 26:35.863
WITH PRODUCE LIKE LEAFY GREENS,

26:35.932 --> 26:36.464
YOUR OPTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

26:36.533 --> 26:39.801
MORE LIMITED.

26:39.870 --> 26:40.434
>> RINSING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

26:40.503 --> 26:40.968
IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA, BUT

26:41.037 --> 26:41.936
HEALTH EXPERTS SAY E. COLI ISN'T

26:42.005 --> 26:46.174
EASILY WASHED AWAY.

26:46.243 --> 26:46.841
>> I HAD A PROFESSOR WHO USED TO

26:46.910 --> 26:47.375
SAY, "YOU CAN'T STERILIZE

26:47.444 --> 26:50.945
LETTUCE WITH A BLOWTORCH."

26:51.014 --> 26:51.279
>> John: WOW.

26:51.348 --> 26:55.650
THAT IS A STRIKING THING FOR

26:55.719 --> 26:56.617
YOUR PROFESSOR TO HAVE SAID.

26:56.686 --> 26:57.585
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, IT'S

26:57.654 --> 26:58.186
TECHNICALLY NOT TRUE, BECAUSE

26:58.255 --> 26:58.986
YOU OBVIOUSLY CAN STERILIZE

26:59.055 --> 27:04.625
LETTUCE WITH A BLOWTORCH.

27:04.694 --> 27:05.359
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS,

27:05.428 --> 27:05.960
JUST WATCH ME!

27:06.029 --> 27:06.561
SEE, I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS A

27:06.630 --> 27:08.229
GOOD IDEA, OR THAT IT TASTES

27:08.298 --> 27:09.497
GOOD AFTERWARDS, I'M JUST SAYING

27:09.566 --> 27:10.865
THAT YOU CLEARLY CAN STERILIZE

27:10.934 --> 27:15.069
LETTUCE WITH A BLOWTORCH.

27:15.138 --> 27:15.269
OKAY?

27:15.338 --> 27:18.739
FACTS MATTER.

27:18.808 --> 27:21.509
AND ALL OF THIS WOULD MAKE YOU

27:21.578 --> 27:23.478
HOPE THAT OUR PRODUCE IS AS

27:23.547 --> 27:24.612
THOROUGHLY INSPECTED AS OUR

27:24.681 --> 27:25.446
BEEF, BUT THE OPPOSITE IS THE

27:25.515 --> 27:28.950
CASE.

27:29.019 --> 27:29.851
BECAUSE WHILE THERE ARE OVER

27:29.920 --> 27:31.419
7,000 WORKERS OVERSEEING BEEF

27:31.488 --> 27:33.221
FOR THE USDA, THERE ARE ONLY 614

27:33.290 --> 27:35.022
FDA FIELD INVESTIGATORS

27:35.091 --> 27:36.491
RESPONSIBLE FOR LEAFY GREENS.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.226
AND I'D SAY THIS IS A DISASTER

27:38.295 --> 27:39.327
WAITING TO HAPPEN, EXCEPT IT

27:39.396 --> 27:39.861
ALREADY HAS HAPPENED, AND

27:39.930 --> 27:43.564
REPEATEDLY.

27:43.633 --> 27:46.033
IN 2018, AN E. COLI OUTBREAK IN

27:46.102 --> 27:47.735
LEAFY GREENS SICKENED 240 PEOPLE

27:47.804 --> 27:49.203
AND KILLED FIVE ACROSS 36

27:49.272 --> 27:51.005
STATES.

27:51.074 --> 27:51.806
LATER THAT SAME FALL, A

27:51.875 --> 27:55.009
DIFFERENT E. COLI OUTBREAK HIT

27:55.078 --> 27:56.511
-- AGAIN IN LEAFY GREENS -- BUT

27:56.580 --> 27:58.045
THE FDA WAS SO TIED UP DEALING

27:58.114 --> 27:58.946
WITH THE FIRST ONE THAT AN FDA

27:59.015 --> 28:01.115
EXECUTIVE WROTE TO HIS

28:01.184 --> 28:02.250
COLLEAGUES, "I HAVE NO RESOURCES

28:02.319 --> 28:03.518
TO DEPLOY."

28:03.587 --> 28:05.086
AND IT'S A LITTLE DISCONCERTING

28:05.155 --> 28:06.320
THAT MESSAGES FROM A MODERN

28:06.389 --> 28:07.622
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT SOUND A

28:07.691 --> 28:08.456
LOT LIKE MISSIVES FROM THE CIVIL

28:08.525 --> 28:11.859
WAR.

28:11.928 --> 28:13.928
AND AS THIS FOOD SAFETY EXPERT

28:13.997 --> 28:14.562
EXPLAINS, ALL OF THAT LEADS TO A

28:14.631 --> 28:16.998
TRULY STRIKING TRUTH.

28:17.067 --> 28:18.299
>> WHEN YOU EAT A HAMBURGER,

28:18.368 --> 28:20.034
THE -- THE MOST DANGEROUS PART

28:20.103 --> 28:23.337
OF THAT IS NOT THE BURGER.

28:23.406 --> 28:24.071
IT'S GOING TO BE THE ONION,

28:24.140 --> 28:27.475
LETTUCE, AND THE TOMATOES.

28:27.544 --> 28:28.109
>> John: THAT NOT GREAT TO HEAR,

28:28.178 --> 28:29.310
IS IT?

28:29.379 --> 28:30.545
PARTLY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

28:30.614 --> 28:31.479
LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE LETTUCE,

28:31.548 --> 28:32.647
ONION, AND TOMATOES ARE

28:32.716 --> 28:33.815
DANGEROUS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE I

28:33.884 --> 28:35.149
DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD

28:35.218 --> 28:38.186
WHERE GOING TO PANERA IS EDGY.

28:38.255 --> 28:39.787
PANERA IS, AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE,

28:39.856 --> 28:40.888
A MILQUETOAST SUBURBAN

28:40.957 --> 28:42.123
DESTINATION WHERE WOMEN IN THEIR

28:42.192 --> 28:44.759
50s GOSSIP, GIRLS IN THEIR

28:44.828 --> 28:45.359
TEENS GOSSIP AND ONE VERY OLD

28:45.428 --> 28:46.227
MAN EATS A BAGEL OVER THE COURSE

28:46.296 --> 28:48.996
OF THREE HOURS.

28:49.065 --> 28:50.364
PANERA SHOULD NOT BE EDGY, BUT

28:50.433 --> 28:52.133
AS THE FDA SEEMS TO HAVE TURNED

28:52.202 --> 28:53.167
A GREEK SALAD INTO A LOADED GUN,

28:53.236 --> 28:55.870
I GUESS IT FUCKING IS NOW.

28:55.939 --> 28:57.338
SO BY THIS POINT, IT SHOULD BE

28:57.407 --> 28:57.905
CLEAR A MASSIVE OVERHAUL IS

28:57.974 --> 29:00.074
NEEDED HERE.

29:00.143 --> 29:01.409
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW, OVERHAULS

29:01.478 --> 29:03.644
IN FOOD SAFETY CAN HAPPEN!

29:03.713 --> 29:06.247
IT HAPPENED TO THE USDA 30

29:06.316 --> 29:08.516
YEARS AGO, AFTER UNDERCOOKED

29:08.585 --> 29:09.117
HAMBURGERS AT JACK IN THE BOX

29:09.186 --> 29:10.084
RESTAURANTS LED TO ONE OF THE

29:10.153 --> 29:11.219
WORST E. COLI OUTBREAKS IN U.S.

29:11.288 --> 29:13.321
HISTORY.

29:13.390 --> 29:15.156
FOUR CHILDREN DIED DURING THAT

29:15.225 --> 29:16.090
-- SOMETHING THAT, JUST AS A

29:16.159 --> 29:18.426
SIDE NOTE, JACK IN THE BOX

29:18.495 --> 29:19.360
EXECUTIVES AT THE TIME COULD'VE

29:19.429 --> 29:21.762
HANDLED WITH A LITTLE MORE TACT.

29:21.831 --> 29:23.397
>> THE COMPANY'S PRESIDENT SAYS

29:23.466 --> 29:24.932
JACK IN THE BOX WILL PAY ALL

29:25.001 --> 29:26.167
MEDICAL EXPENSES FOR THOSE WHO

29:26.236 --> 29:27.568
GOT SICK, AND HE URGED CUSTOMERS

29:27.637 --> 29:29.570
TO COME BACK TO AVERT ANOTHER

29:29.639 --> 29:31.405
BLOW TO THE COMPANY.

29:31.474 --> 29:32.907
>> AND THAT SECOND TRAGEDY WOULD

29:32.976 --> 29:36.711
BE LOSS OF JOBS.

29:36.780 --> 29:37.411
>> John: THAT IS A SHITTY

29:37.480 --> 29:39.280
RESPONSE.

29:39.349 --> 29:40.681
ALSO, HOW IS IT THE CUSTOMER'S

29:40.750 --> 29:42.617
RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP YOUR

29:42.686 --> 29:43.751
EMPLOYEES FROM LOSING THEIR

29:43.820 --> 29:44.585
JOBS?

29:44.654 --> 29:46.187
IF WE ACCIDENTALLY KILLED FOUR

29:46.256 --> 29:48.356
PEOPLE DURING ONE OF OUR

29:48.425 --> 29:49.991
MULTIPLE STUPID EXPLOSIONS, I

29:50.060 --> 29:50.625
WOULDN'T BE BEGGING YOU TO KEEP

29:50.694 --> 29:52.293
WATCHING OUR SHOW.

29:52.362 --> 29:53.628
I'D BE GETTING SENT TO PRISON.

29:53.697 --> 29:54.228
EXCEPT I'M JUST KIDDING, RICH

29:54.297 --> 29:55.830
WHITE CELEBRITIES DON'T GO TO

29:55.899 --> 29:57.665
PRISON.

29:57.734 --> 29:58.866
FELICITY HUFFMAN TOOK ONE FOR

29:58.935 --> 29:59.600
THE WHOLE TEAM, SO NOW WE'RE

29:59.669 --> 30:01.102
SQUARE.

30:01.171 --> 30:02.370
THE POINT IS, AFTER JACK IN THE

30:02.439 --> 30:04.605
BOX, THERE WAS A PUBLIC OUTCRY,

30:04.674 --> 30:05.206
PROMPTING A MAJOR OVERHAUL TO

30:05.275 --> 30:07.675
THE USDA.

30:07.744 --> 30:08.342
AND THE THING IS, THE FDA ALMOST

30:08.411 --> 30:12.580
HAD A SIMILAR MOMENT.

30:12.649 --> 30:13.281
BACK IN THE LATE AUGHTS, THERE

30:13.350 --> 30:14.382
WERE A SERIES OF HORRIFIC

30:14.451 --> 30:15.550
OUTBREAKS IN PEANUT BUTTER,

30:15.619 --> 30:18.085
SPINACH, AND OTHER FOODS.

30:18.154 --> 30:18.719
AND IN RESPONSE, CONGRESS PASSED

30:18.788 --> 30:20.855
THE FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION

30:20.924 --> 30:22.023
ACT, WHICH GAVE THE FDA SWEEPING

30:22.092 --> 30:24.292
NEW POWERS TO REGULATE FOOD.

30:24.361 --> 30:25.860
AND AT THE TIME, EVERYONE

30:25.929 --> 30:26.461
THOUGHT THIS WAS A PRETTY BIG

30:26.530 --> 30:27.728
DEAL.

30:27.797 --> 30:28.563
>> TODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNS

30:28.632 --> 30:29.964
A BILL FOR THE FIRST MAJOR

30:30.033 --> 30:31.899
OVERHAUL OF THE U.S. FOOD SAFETY

30:31.968 --> 30:34.068
SYSTEM IN ALMOST A CENTURY.

30:34.137 --> 30:34.669
>> IT WILL GIVE THE FOOD AND

30:34.738 --> 30:35.403
DRUG ADMINISTRATION NEW POWERS

30:35.472 --> 30:38.573
TO FORCE MANDATORY RECALLS WHEN

30:38.642 --> 30:39.774
FOODBORNE ILLNESS OR OTHER

30:39.843 --> 30:42.076
HAZARDS ARE FOUND IN THE U.S.

30:42.145 --> 30:42.810
FOOD SUPPLY.

30:42.879 --> 30:43.544
>> IF THIS LAW IS A HUGE

30:43.613 --> 30:44.979
SUCCESS, A LOT OF THAT SUCCESS

30:45.048 --> 30:47.115
IS GOING TO BE INVISIBLE. YOU

30:47.184 --> 30:47.715
ARE NOT GOING TO BE SEEING AS

30:47.784 --> 30:54.784
MANY PEOPLE SICK.

30:56.760 --> 30:57.125
>> John: YEAH!

30:57.194 --> 30:57.692
IT SOUNDED GREAT!

30:57.761 --> 30:58.226
EXCEPT IF ALL OF THAT HAD

30:58.295 --> 30:58.860
ACTUALLY HAPPENED, I WOULDN'T BE

30:58.929 --> 30:59.427
DOING THIS STORY RIGHT NOW,

30:59.496 --> 30:59.660
WOULD I?

30:59.729 --> 31:00.261
WE'D BE BACK TO OUR REGULARLY

31:00.330 --> 31:01.129
SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING OF HAMSTER

31:01.198 --> 31:01.896
LONELINESS OR, I DON'T KNOW,

31:01.965 --> 31:04.031
FUCKIN' TROUT GOUT.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.199
SPOILER ALERT, IT'S MORE COMMON

31:05.268 --> 31:05.800
THAN YOU THINK, AND CONGRESS

31:05.869 --> 31:08.770
REFUSES TO ACT.

31:08.839 --> 31:10.371
THERE WERE JUST TWO SMALL

31:10.440 --> 31:10.972
PROBLEMS WITH THE FOOD SAFETY

31:11.041 --> 31:11.873
MODERNIZATION ACT: FIRST, WE

31:11.942 --> 31:14.075
DIDN'T FUND THE FDA TO DO ALL

31:14.144 --> 31:14.675
THE NEW THINGS THAT WE'D JUST

31:14.744 --> 31:15.777
ASKED IT TO DO.

31:15.846 --> 31:17.011
AND SECOND, THE AGENCY WAS STILL

31:17.080 --> 31:18.045
HAMSTRUNG BY ITS GLACIAL

31:18.114 --> 31:20.214
BUREAUCRACY.

31:20.283 --> 31:21.349
FOR INSTANCE, THE LAW MANDATED

31:21.418 --> 31:22.250
THE FDA COME UP WITH A STANDARD

31:22.319 --> 31:24.919
FOR WATER BEING USED IN

31:24.988 --> 31:25.553
AGRICULTURE -- BASICALLY, A WAY

31:25.622 --> 31:27.155
TO KEEP YOUR SALAD FROM GETTING

31:27.224 --> 31:28.856
LIGHTLY MISTED WITH MICROSCOPIC

31:28.925 --> 31:30.191
COW SHIT.

31:30.260 --> 31:32.527
THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S 12

31:32.596 --> 31:33.194
YEARS LATER, AND IT STILL HASN'T

31:33.263 --> 31:35.329
PRODUCED A FINAL RULE.

31:35.398 --> 31:37.231
THEY DID, IN DECEMBER 2021,

31:37.300 --> 31:38.699
UNVEIL A PROPOSED RULE, BUT IT

31:38.768 --> 31:39.567
HAD MAJOR PROBLEMS -- INCLUDING

31:39.636 --> 31:40.334
THE FACT THAT IT DIDN'T MANDATE

31:40.403 --> 31:43.304
ANY TESTING.

31:43.373 --> 31:43.838
INSTEAD, IT ASKED PRODUCER

31:43.907 --> 31:45.072
GROWERS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS

31:45.141 --> 31:47.074
THEIR OWN POTENTIAL HAZARDS.

31:47.143 --> 31:48.209
WHICH IS CLEARLY LESS OF A WATER

31:48.278 --> 31:49.977
STANDARD AND MORE OF A

31:50.046 --> 31:52.013
SELF-GRADED WATER QUIZ.

31:52.082 --> 31:54.081
AND WHILE IT'D BE GREAT IF

31:54.150 --> 31:56.350
BUSINESSES COULD BE TRUSTED TO

31:56.419 --> 31:56.984
KEEP THEMSELVES IN CHECK, THAT'S

31:57.053 --> 31:58.920
NOT GENERALLY HOW THINGS GO.

31:58.989 --> 32:01.689
FOR A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS, LOOK

32:01.758 --> 32:03.224
AT LITERALLY ANY BUSINESS.

32:03.293 --> 32:03.891
AND LOOK, SOME PEOPLE MIGHT

32:03.960 --> 32:06.694
ARGUE THAT THE FDA SIMPLY NEEDS

32:06.763 --> 32:07.295
TO BE FUNDED BETTER, AND THAT

32:07.364 --> 32:08.663
ITS LINES OF AUTHORITY NEED TO

32:08.732 --> 32:09.330
BE CLEARER.

32:09.399 --> 32:09.931
AND TO BE FAIR, THERE HAS BEEN

32:10.000 --> 32:12.066
SOME RECENT PROGRESS THERE.

32:12.135 --> 32:12.800
JUST LAST MONTH, THEY

32:12.869 --> 32:15.336
ESTABLISHED A NEW ROLE AT THE

32:15.405 --> 32:15.937
AGENCY, SO ONE PERSON COULD BE

32:16.006 --> 32:18.005
IN CHARGE OF THE FDA'S ENTIRE

32:18.074 --> 32:19.941
FOOD SAFETY PROGRAM.

32:20.010 --> 32:23.277
IT'S A BIT INCREDIBLE THAT ROLE

32:23.346 --> 32:25.913
DIDN'T EXIST UNTIL NOW, BUT

32:25.982 --> 32:26.814
STILL, I'LL TAKE IT!

32:26.883 --> 32:28.449
THE PROBLEM IS, HISTORY STRONGLY

32:28.518 --> 32:29.917
SUGGESTS IT WON'T BE NEARLY

32:29.986 --> 32:31.486
ENOUGH.

32:31.555 --> 32:34.655
A MUCH BOLDER PLAN WOULD BE TO

32:34.724 --> 32:35.189
ACTUALLY BREAK THE FDA UP

32:35.258 --> 32:36.791
COMPLETELY AND IN DOING SO,

32:36.860 --> 32:38.326
CREATE A NEW AGENCY SOLELY

32:38.395 --> 32:39.894
DEVOTED TO FOOD.

32:39.963 --> 32:41.329
NOW, THAT'S A BIG MOVE, AND ONE

32:41.398 --> 32:42.130
LIKELY TO FACE SIGNIFICANT

32:42.199 --> 32:43.531
RESISTANCE -- AND IT WOULD NEED

32:43.600 --> 32:44.465
TO BE DONE VERY CAREFULLY.

32:44.534 --> 32:45.833
BUT I'D ARGUE IT MIGHT BE WORTH

32:45.902 --> 32:47.034
IT.

32:47.103 --> 32:48.803
SO MANY EXPERTS WE TALKED TO FOR

32:48.872 --> 32:50.204
THIS STORY SAID, IF WE WERE TO

32:50.273 --> 32:51.739
BUILD A FOOD SAFETY SYSTEM FROM

32:51.808 --> 32:52.840
SCRATCH, IT'D LOOK NOTHING LIKE

32:52.909 --> 32:54.275
THE FRACTURED SYSTEM WE HAVE

32:54.344 --> 32:58.513
TODAY.

32:58.582 --> 32:59.046
AND THE FACT IS, UNDER THE

32:59.115 --> 32:59.814
SYSTEM WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, FUTURE

32:59.883 --> 33:02.049
OUTBREAKS AREN'T JUST POSSIBLE,

33:02.118 --> 33:04.418
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY INEVITABLE.

33:04.487 --> 33:05.653
AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T WANT TO

33:05.722 --> 33:06.254
LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THE ONLY

33:06.323 --> 33:09.624
100% SAFE WAY TO PREPARE A VERY,

33:09.693 --> 33:16.430
VERY BASIC SALAD IS THIS.

33:16.499 --> 33:21.202
AND NOW, THIS!

33:21.271 --> 33:22.537
>> Announcer: AND NOW, CHECK OUT

33:22.606 --> 33:24.205
THE SEXUAL TENSION BETWEEN FOX
