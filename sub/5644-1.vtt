01:00.283 --> 01:06.117
- Harriet, I told you to get dressed. - Do I have to follow?

01:06.200 --> 01:10.283
I have a history test ... You're not ashamed.

01:10.367 --> 01:13.283
It's my bedroom, not arena.

01:13.367 --> 01:18.325
Have you bought a new one? Why are you dressing up? It's just breakfast.

01:18.408 --> 01:22.075
No, we're gonna have breakfast out.

01:22.158 --> 01:27.700
- Before I drive, at least? - So low cut it wasn't in the picture.

01:27.783 --> 01:33.950
- The model had some tits. - Thanks. See if Harriet is ready.

01:46.492 --> 01:51.117
- Spoiler, she's in the end. - Claire, don't be mean.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.492
- Where's Dad? - Yes, where can he be?

01:54.575 --> 02:00.200
Richard, up with you. How late were you left in the office last night?

02:00.283 --> 02:05.283
It doesn't sound like a lawyer, though writing does not give paid per hour.

02:05.367 --> 02:09.782
It can take a whole day to form a sentence.

02:09.866 --> 02:15.950
Do you write a book or chop a tombstone? You promised to come along.

02:16.033 --> 02:21.075
- We'll have breakfast. - We'll have breakfast outside.

02:25.075 --> 02:29.742
- You could support me. - How? After all, you're gone every night.

02:29.825 --> 02:35.825
Why are you so excited? You write a book about finding its inner peace.

02:35.908 --> 02:38.992
- I just want to sleep. - I have gags.

02:39.075 --> 02:44.200
Okay, you're driving. And he doesn't sleep, he'll follow along.

02:45.408 --> 02:49.117
- What are they doing here? - They're going.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.908
If I say "get a room" you will take my room again.

02:53.992 --> 02:57.367
Caroline, we got such a good idea.

02:57.450 --> 03:03.242
- Why are you wearing nine uniforms? - We're going to work after.

03:03.325 --> 03:09.408
- No, Alex! No character! - Yes. 8 words, the first word.

03:11.658 --> 03:16.117
How do you get the first word? I do everything as a long thing.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.450
No, I've seen your characters. We will be late in reality.

03:20.533 --> 03:24.325
- We're getting married. - I couldn't do the the whole package.

03:24.408 --> 03:29.075
The garden is so big and nice. We have lanterns and light trails.

03:29.158 --> 03:33.033
You know what it's like to be young and drive.

03:33.117 --> 03:39.867
- Married in my bathtub, if you wish. - The best sister ever.

03:39.950 --> 03:43.950
- Can we go now? - So, where?

03:44.033 --> 03:47.658
- Shall we go out? - Doesn't anyone read my SMS?

03:47.742 --> 03:51.617
Yes, we do. We like them.

03:51.700 --> 03:56.617
- Caroline, I just want to lie down. -Why do you have to go out promptly?

03:56.700 --> 04:03.117
For normal families go out and have a nice breakfast. Now we are normal.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.617
What are you wearing? Oh well, that's fine.

04:22.950 --> 04:27.242
- Hi, Joshua. - Honey! Where have you been?

04:27.325 --> 04:33.492
- I've been trying to reach you for 20 hours. - I've been on a plane.

04:33.575 --> 04:37.950
Where are you, at the International Space Station?

04:38.033 --> 04:41.200
Mom, Joshua wants to talk to you.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.533
- Wait. - You should try the dress now.

04:46.617 --> 04:53.075
- You get your movie. She wants a break. - She has just been on vacation.

04:53.158 --> 04:56.450
Are you in Australia now?

04:56.533 --> 05:02.033
Look at Honey's contract, You should ask me about everything. Australia!

05:02.117 --> 05:06.408
- Check out her Twitter flow. - Twitter? I'm not twelve years old.

05:06.492 --> 05:09.617
You learn to take care of yourself. We'll be home for a couple of days.

05:09.700 --> 05:14.533
- Honey! Hey! Welcome home! - I'm fine, Doug.

05:14.617 --> 05:17.658
Shit, thank you.

05:17.742 --> 05:22.117
Well, honey, darling.

05:22.200 --> 05:28.617
God, that's good. If you need a photographer ... What are you looking?

05:28.700 --> 05:32.700
That's why I'm the right man. Perfect.

05:32.783 --> 05:36.033
Don't touch me. Rhonda Birchmore!

05:36.117 --> 05:40.617
You look hungry, did you sleep on the plane? Maybe we should have been waiting a little.

05:40.700 --> 05:44.867
That's how you must look. I'll spray on your face.

05:44.950 --> 05:49.908
- Stop, what's up with you? - You don't know how you look, like now?

05:49.992 --> 05:55.242
You behave strangely. Why you were hiding in the tax booth?

05:55.325 --> 05:59.533
You shouldn't see I brought a gift for you.

05:59.617 --> 06:03.992
It's a charm for my little kangaroo.

06:04.075 --> 06:09.158
- I don't want to be photographed now. - What are we doing?

06:09.242 --> 06:13.033
One million hits in a day.

06:13.117 --> 06:17.742
We wrote something about being in Australia. They love it.

06:36.533 --> 06:40.533
- Should we have breakfast now? - I want my bag.

06:40.617 --> 06:45.408
How difficult is it to find your suitcase?

06:45.492 --> 06:51.617
Caroline, my bag ended up on another plane. Incredible, huh?

06:51.700 --> 06:55.617
God, how old you should be.

06:55.700 --> 07:02.242
Claire and Harriet. Haven't you grown since?

07:02.325 --> 07:06.908
- What did you do to the guy? - I've cut myself.

07:06.992 --> 07:09.825
Hi, Richard.

07:09.908 --> 07:15.700
- Where's Katie? - She ... Talking with Aunt Beth.

07:15.783 --> 07:20.325
Katie! - Alex, don't let her leave.

07:20.408 --> 07:24.075
- Come on. - No, I'm getting in, again.

07:24.158 --> 07:29.200
- How can you do that? - The family? What a monster.

07:29.283 --> 07:34.617
- Katie, she's sorry for that. - Is she here to apologize?

07:34.700 --> 07:40.158
Yes. No, not really. They're going to release Honeys pop right here.

07:40.242 --> 07:46.117
It's time to spend time with us. It was important for her to be with you.

07:46.200 --> 07:50.533
- It's good. - Good? Who are you?

07:50.617 --> 07:54.783
- Isn't it time to move on? - Go on?

07:54.867 --> 08:00.325
Who are you calling? Do you have her book in your phone? How can you read it?

08:00.408 --> 08:04.283
You don't read by leaves, but by paragraphs.

08:04.367 --> 08:08.200
"I'm annoyed with Honey's diet after seeing my sister Katie "-

08:08.283 --> 08:12.492
- "Fight with her overweight."

08:12.575 --> 08:18.617
- Why did she wrote so? It's a lie. - Me and you, we know it.

08:18.700 --> 08:24.158
- No one else knows so. - Honey, it's clear they know.

08:24.242 --> 08:28.533
Sorry, sir. Is she thick?

08:30.283 --> 08:34.741
Do you think my feast looks thick?

08:36.491 --> 08:40.700
You don't have any relation on that. You don't look, you just say no.

08:40.783 --> 08:43.116
Lilla Katie!

08:47.075 --> 08:52.158
It must be Alex. Welcome to the family.

08:52.242 --> 08:56.617
Look at you, Katie! You're a real woman now.

08:56.700 --> 09:01.992
- She will say immediately I'm thick. - Well, I didn't say that.

09:02.075 --> 09:08.617
- Huh? What do you think ... - Due to Chapters 3, 5, 8 and 11.

09:08.700 --> 09:13.075
That was the proposal, they want you to take it out and swing.

09:13.158 --> 09:16.658
It was a huge mistake.

09:16.742 --> 09:22.533
- That was the proposal, it was a mistake. - I was here when she said it!

09:22.617 --> 09:28.575
I'm really sorry. Please, don't.

09:28.658 --> 09:30.783
Where's my little niece?

09:30.867 --> 09:37.158
Thanks. - Yes, Roy! Look, what a body.

09:37.242 --> 09:40.325
Show it off!

09:40.408 --> 09:43.658
Do it! Do it! Do it!

09:48.033 --> 09:50.950
God!

09:51.033 --> 09:54.950
Mindi and Sian! They're here!

09:55.033 --> 09:59.658
- Is she American? - They've been living in Los Angeles for 6 years.

09:59.742 --> 10:03.742
Katie! Caroline!

10:06.408 --> 10:09.700
- Which one is you? - Katie, the one with the noise.

10:09.783 --> 10:13.325
I have a forgiveness problem.

10:13.408 --> 10:18.242
- Hi, Uncle Richard! - Hi, honey. Nice to see you.

10:18.325 --> 10:24.033
It can't be Harriet. Mother! She's wearing her "monkey girl suit"!

10:24.117 --> 10:29.200
Hey, Indian girl. Awesome t-shirt.

10:29.283 --> 10:33.867
- We have to go shopping. - Sure.

10:33.950 --> 10:38.117
Shut up! Is it Alex?

10:38.200 --> 10:42.617
God, Katie! What is he!

10:44.200 --> 10:49.200
- Thanks. - Two veterinarians in the same family.

10:49.283 --> 10:54.200
- What a cute outfit. - Nice, do you think?

10:54.283 --> 10:57.867
The embroidered puppy was my idea.

10:57.950 --> 11:04.200
- Honey, who are they ... - My stylist and assistant.

11:04.283 --> 11:07.950
Doug is my bodyguard. Roy, get out from the pool!

11:08.033 --> 11:12.908
- Why did you lace up? - It looks cruel. Or Katie?

11:12.992 --> 11:17.283
I must be blond in the video. I'm gonna dropped as single.

11:17.367 --> 11:22.658
Not a "monkey girl" single, a real one. We recorded a video in Mexico.

11:22.742 --> 11:28.283
- Come on, Diane. - We have to start. The room is perfect.

11:28.367 --> 11:33.242
- My assistant was a replacement. - Yeah, it's perfect.

11:33.325 --> 11:38.950
- Beautiful! Look, Caroline. - Oh! The curtain looks nice.

11:39.033 --> 11:44.950
We're putting it up in "YouTube". Everyone has to like it.

11:45.033 --> 11:49.742
- The light disappeared. - We take family pictures.

11:49.825 --> 11:54.492
- The family portrait, I mean. - What family portrait?

11:54.575 --> 11:59.908
- Honey wants to write about the vacation here. - Katie should change.

11:59.992 --> 12:04.367
No, you look so ordinary wonderful. - Honey, come here!

12:04.450 --> 12:09.908
- Richard, hug Caroline. - We take it after breakfast, we are starving.

12:09.992 --> 12:14.950
- I can't have breakfast now. - You asked me to bring everyone here.

12:15.033 --> 12:20.825
Caroline, Diane said the light out is ideal now, we don't have time for breakfast.

12:20.908 --> 12:25.367
Don't pose, please. Grazing is like a normal family.

12:25.450 --> 12:29.325
Talk, be happy. Enjoy the company.

12:29.408 --> 12:33.825
- Fuck, Alex! - Yeah, that was fun.

12:33.908 --> 12:40.158
- Sorry, they found your suitcase. - Sure. After that we go down.

12:40.242 --> 12:46.283
- Leave it in my room. - It's not there. Police.

12:46.367 --> 12:52.700
- It was hard for everyone to get here. - Can you identify your luggage?

12:52.783 --> 12:58.283
- My daughter has a photo shoot. - We don't need to talk to her.

12:58.367 --> 13:04.283
- I'll take it later. 5 o'clock? - We want you to come now.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.283
Certainly. I will fix it.

13:08.950 --> 13:13.367
Mindi, Sian! This is my new little sister.

13:15.367 --> 13:18.658
From ...

13:22.158 --> 13:28.158
- Beth, where are you going? - Never mind. I'll go jogging.

13:34.075 --> 13:38.617
- Caroline? - Beth?

13:42.700 --> 13:46.117
Stop, Miss Halloway!

13:51.742 --> 13:58.450
- Okay, now life is in a gap. - It's from TV, after all. Unbelievable.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.117
Isn't it incredible?

14:09.408 --> 14:12.117
Stay!

14:13.200 --> 14:16.492
Calm down, Miss Halloway.

14:16.575 --> 14:21.783
Diane, do the photo shoot. - Caroline, take her to Honey.

14:21.867 --> 14:27.617
We are not in that mood. The Rolling Stones taught me.

14:27.700 --> 14:32.992
- Diane! - Miss Halloway, join us.

14:35.908 --> 14:40.408
I want Diane to come back.

14:42.033 --> 14:46.617
You know what? I understand you are stressed-

14:46.700 --> 14:52.158
- but I'm also stressed. 30 seconds ago the mussels have been removed.

14:52.242 --> 14:57.533
I couldn't help you before and now the gas is running out.

14:59.242 --> 15:04.242
Miss Halloway, you've never been arrested for illegal drug smuggling.

15:04.325 --> 15:09.075
It's just a pain relief. It hurts if you fix your eyes.

15:12.325 --> 15:18.033
- 500 OxyContin tablets? - I didn't want to end with them.

15:18.117 --> 15:23.283
My goodness, Beth. You don't have to fix it.

15:23.367 --> 15:28.617
Says someone who looks like someone has pressed a fork on his face.

15:28.700 --> 15:32.867
- Know Honey? - Mindi said you go shopping.

15:32.950 --> 15:38.242
- How nice. Get me there. - Was your lawyer?

15:38.325 --> 15:43.408
- Can't you represent me? - I'm a corporate lawyer.

15:43.492 --> 15:45.783
Would you like to buy a deal?

15:45.867 --> 15:50.033
- I have no lawyer. - Who did you call with your phone?

15:58.075 --> 16:03.242
I will take care of it. - The ladies.

16:06.575 --> 16:10.783
A photographer. Are you unsatisfied with the switch images?

16:10.867 --> 16:16.200
- Diane stay, I have his card. - Beth, there will be no photo shoot.

16:16.283 --> 16:19.700
How should I launch Honey's single ones?

16:19.783 --> 16:23.950
- You've been arrested. - We pay the bow sum money.

16:24.033 --> 16:28.492
You run the risk of escaping. You risked people's lives.

16:28.575 --> 16:33.075
- Think the chef didn't sign you up. - Which chef?

16:33.158 --> 16:36.992
The one you almost set on fire.

16:37.075 --> 16:42.033
Fried. That was not the point. You can't keep me here.

16:42.117 --> 16:44.242
We are not.

16:44.325 --> 16:49.867
Your sister insisted, us to sign up you for detoxification.

16:51.783 --> 16:55.992
I don't need to be detoxed. I've just managed.

16:56.075 --> 16:58.950
Eight months ago.

16:59.033 --> 17:04.617
Honey, ...? What's going on with her? - Caroline?

17:04.700 --> 17:10.282
- She can stay in our dining room. - That's where Richard sleeps.

17:10.367 --> 17:13.242
No. Sometimes.

17:15.532 --> 17:21.742
He works late and doesn't want to wake me up. The guest room is in the front door.

17:21.825 --> 17:26.075
- Andy, the car's here. - Okay. You follow us.

17:26.157 --> 17:32.283
- No. Caroline, help me. - I promise to take care of her, honey.

17:32.367 --> 17:38.617
Do the photo shoot. What should she do? go after "Monkey girl 4"?

17:38.700 --> 17:42.867
- Anyone else? - She's ashamed!

17:42.950 --> 17:47.450
- After that, she gets old. - She's sixteen!

17:47.533 --> 17:50.658
Sex sells for her age, not monkeys.

17:50.742 --> 17:55.742
She's not going to have a relief. She needs a new career now.

17:55.825 --> 18:00.700
- Promise to take her to the place. - My God, okay I'll do it.

18:00.783 --> 18:07.533
But don't tell the movie company. They just care about their film series.

18:12.408 --> 18:17.117
I could have beaten her. She was high on pain.

18:17.200 --> 18:21.367
Charles, that's me. Can you do a research for the drug laws?

18:21.450 --> 18:24.992
What a fucking word. I'll do it.

18:25.075 --> 18:30.825
- Is that Roger? Are you at work? - Singapore greens will do on Monday.

18:30.908 --> 18:35.867
- What time is it? - Why are you talking on the phone?

18:35.950 --> 18:39.575
- It's Caroline. - Where is she?

18:39.658 --> 18:44.492
Make sure my uterus has cracked. She hates women's things.

18:44.575 --> 18:48.658
She has broken the womb.

18:53.283 --> 18:56.408
Are you very hurt?

18:56.492 --> 19:01.450
Make sure I'll leave for Singapore on Monday. I have also something else to arrange.

19:01.533 --> 19:07.533
God, shall we go home with you? How fucking cruel is that?

19:10.200 --> 19:15.033
- I'll tell you at home. - Sorry, for the damage in the kitchen ...

19:16.742 --> 19:22.908
- Awesome, Sebastian? - Seb.

19:24.117 --> 19:28.283
- Today's day? - Chief.

19:28.367 --> 19:33.117
Three clams? I'm Beth Halloway's sister ... Lawyer.

19:33.200 --> 19:37.367
- I'm not filing. - So generous.

19:44.742 --> 19:49.200
- Then we discussed for the damage. - What damage?

19:49.283 --> 19:53.450
She wanted a lot. A big package flies away ...

19:53.533 --> 19:56.742
Caroline, there's no danger.

19:56.825 --> 20:02.783
If you change your mind, then I'll work two blocks away in the big, shiny house.

20:02.867 --> 20:07.658
I have no card, would you put my number on the phone?

20:09.200 --> 20:13.367
- I can take yours, otherwise. - I'm flattered, but no thanks.

20:13.450 --> 20:17.950
- Why are you flattered? - I understand.

20:18.033 --> 20:24.158
You probably don't. My sister got a breakdown, we were with the police.

20:24.242 --> 20:30.075
And you think I'm here to invite you?

20:30.158 --> 20:35.533
You mentioned the TV show. Many women want my number.

20:35.617 --> 20:37.783
Jsses.

20:37.867 --> 20:41.908
Thanks for not reporting.

20:47.033 --> 20:50.700
You should add a clam.

20:55.367 --> 20:59.617
Claire, mom wrote that she is in trouble. Make sure I'll be in the office.

20:59.700 --> 21:04.533
- Why has she said that she should be here? - Because she's your mother.

21:04.617 --> 21:11.075
Make sure Harriet takes Honey to sleep at hers. What are you doing inside?

21:11.158 --> 21:14.575
Nothing.

21:27.325 --> 21:32.450
Oh my God. Oh my God!

21:32.533 --> 21:37.242
- Isn't it difficult for an altar? - Your hair looks awesome!

21:38.367 --> 21:43.408
- I love Ryan. - As far "monkey girl" is concerned?

21:43.492 --> 21:46.533
Your purple button skull.

21:49.908 --> 21:54.450
- Caroline, we drink margaritas. - Yes, Caroline. We do.

21:54.533 --> 21:58.033
Did dad said that you had cut yourself?

21:58.117 --> 22:02.283
- Why did Ryan and you end up? - Ryan's a boy.

22:02.367 --> 22:07.492
Sit next to me, Alex. - I need a real man.

22:07.575 --> 22:12.367
It was he who operated your breasts? She has implants.

22:12.450 --> 22:17.242
- Shit. Come on, Alex. - No one knows anyone.

22:17.325 --> 22:22.742
- I didn't think about anything. - What?

22:22.825 --> 22:27.700
Honey, Caroline has something to say.

22:27.783 --> 22:32.367
God, I love the hair cakes.

22:32.450 --> 22:35.783
Honey ...

22:35.867 --> 22:42.367
Your mother ... Beth ... Your mother ... Ended up in trouble today.

22:42.450 --> 22:49.158
- Did she get stuck in the business again? - She didn't go shopping.

22:49.242 --> 22:53.242
She has gone to a detox clinic.

22:53.325 --> 22:58.325
- Who does she know? - Honey, Beth is addicted.

23:00.450 --> 23:03.367
Is that a shame?

23:04.783 --> 23:09.450
- She's addicted to pain relief. - No, she's not.

23:09.533 --> 23:13.992
I'm sorry. She was arrested today.

23:19.242 --> 23:23.658
Have I been kidnapped? Do they know that they are my relatives?

23:25.200 --> 23:30.450
- They are, old man. - They justify you. No offense.

23:30.533 --> 23:35.367
Mom is not addicted to anything. Why she didn't answer to the phone?

23:48.033 --> 23:53.492
- You're safe here with us. - What "belongs to you"?

23:53.575 --> 23:56.450
I showed you your song.

24:01.742 --> 24:05.908
Can I have an Alvedon? I have a headache after the trip.

24:05.992 --> 24:11.783
- No medicine, Miss Halloway. - No, only 5-6 headache tablets.

24:15.033 --> 24:17.950
She doesn't leave the bathroom.

24:18.033 --> 24:21.992
- I order pizza. - Or salad?

24:22.075 --> 24:27.158
- Mindi, you can go to Los Angeles. - Shouldn't we also stay?

24:27.242 --> 24:32.283
- No, we don't have twelve bedrooms. - Who takes care of Honey?

24:32.367 --> 24:36.783
- I'm her aunt. That's good. - Are you a personal trainer?

24:36.867 --> 24:41.992
No, I'm a veterinarian. But I do what I can.

24:42.775 --> 24:45.700
I'm boxing. Sims.

24:45.783 --> 24:49.450
We take quick walks.

24:49.533 --> 24:53.783
- Food and shopping, huh? - Who's gonna dress her?

24:53.867 --> 25:01.075
- We usually take care of ourselves. - We'll probably stop.

25:01.158 --> 25:08.075
It was very nice to meet, but you miss what the motorways?

25:08.158 --> 25:13.117
Promise not to let her out of sight. She doesn't understand her life.

25:13.200 --> 25:17.492
She thinks all cars have a minibar. She's naive.

25:17.575 --> 25:23.450
- The world knows her, not the other way around. - Thank you, which is wise.

25:23.533 --> 25:26.492
Thanks.

25:26.575 --> 25:31.117
Not to be like that, but she does has been in the bathroom for a while.

25:35.408 --> 25:40.283
Is there anything in there, like razor blade?

25:40.367 --> 25:44.867
- I have none right now. - Have you seen her armpits?

25:44.950 --> 25:48.992
Tablets, do you?

25:49.775 --> 25:55.783
- Not until Richard became hellfreak. - Your pink pills, huh?

25:55.867 --> 26:00.367
They are against acne. If she takes them, she'll be fine.

26:00.450 --> 26:03.867
- Aren't you too old for pimples? - Older Acne.

26:03.950 --> 26:08.075
It is also for middle-aged dogs.

26:20.075 --> 26:25.783
Mom is addicted of pain relief? Is she okay?

26:25.867 --> 26:30.867
No, she is addicted. Can you lie down and towel? I'm coming...

26:31.908 --> 26:33.700
God...

26:33.783 --> 26:38.825
She does not do well. I thought she was losing weight.

26:38.908 --> 26:43.200
- Before I meet her? - She can't receive visits.

26:43.283 --> 26:48.617
I didn't want to go here either release the single. I can't live here!

26:48.700 --> 26:51.325
Where was Mindi?

26:51.408 --> 26:55.325
- Honey, not ... - Caroline, how's it going?

27:03.867 --> 27:08.325
- Now it's seven years of bad luck. - Get you or me?

27:13.867 --> 27:20.242
- Caroline Morgan. - It's the "monkey girl" producer.

27:20.325 --> 27:24.950
Well, hey. I'm not involved in Honey's job.

27:25.033 --> 27:29.492
Good. A business lawyer doesn't have to take care of Honey's career.

27:29.575 --> 27:34.700
What's up with Beth? Mindi said that you sent Honey's people home.

27:34.783 --> 27:40.992
- That's not Beth. Where is she? - Honey lives with us, his people.

27:41.775 --> 27:47.783
- I don't need a business lawyer. - Get in touch when you want to buy a business.

27:47.867 --> 27:53.533
You're calm. You raised the sisters when the mother died?

27:53.617 --> 27:59.742
- Excuse me? - In the book. You're not the thick man.

27:59.825 --> 28:05.117
Katie is not thick, but I am took care of everything when mom died.

28:05.200 --> 28:11.200
- I can take care of Honey. - If our brand is damaged at all ...

28:11.283 --> 28:17.783
... so we will sue you. Okay? Hi there.

28:27.492 --> 28:32.742
That's my song, Honey. You sleep with Harriet.

28:49.367 --> 28:52.950
I've been looking at something strange.

28:53.033 --> 28:57.908
- It's a quarter past three. - Three in the morning.

28:57.992 --> 29:02.200
- Honey's sick, come to the hospital. - The hospital?

29:02.283 --> 29:07.617
- She might be sick of the pizza. - I'm fine. Do you, honey?

29:07.700 --> 29:10.658
No, I'm getting tired.

29:10.742 --> 29:16.492
- Kangaroo! My kangaroo is gone! - Has she lost the kangaroo?

29:16.575 --> 29:22.283
From the charm bracelet! I got it from mom and it's gone ...

29:22.367 --> 29:25.283
It's gone!

29:25.367 --> 29:29.408
She's not sick, she has what Richard has.

29:29.492 --> 29:34.075
- Tennis elbow? - No, not tennis ...

29:34.158 --> 29:38.117
Panic Gesture. Forget the hospital.

29:43.200 --> 29:48.075
- Sorry, I got stuck with a chapter. - No, I'm glad you're there.

29:48.158 --> 29:52.617
- You have to cure Honey's panic anxiety. - Okay, I'll come home.

29:52.700 --> 29:54.908
I'm around the corner.

30:04.492 --> 30:10.367
- I don't like it here. It's awful. - Richard's office is up there.

30:10.450 --> 30:14.325
- He has drops. - Why is it off?

30:19.408 --> 30:23.950
What did he do in the health food business?

31:15.200 --> 31:20.617
Honey, how are you doing? Where's Caroline?

31:23.992 --> 31:27.033
Did she feel good?

31:34.117 --> 31:37.742
Caroline ...

31:41.700 --> 31:45.450
Uh ... Hi.

31:49.450 --> 31:54.658
Hall! You just left me out there!

31:54.742 --> 31:57.992
He wanted to tell you.

32:09.367 --> 32:13.825
You want some of that?

32:19.867 --> 32:23.492
Is Honey good?

32:23.575 --> 32:27.783
What is it? Why are you crying?

32:27.867 --> 32:32.200
I was worried about Honey, but she's fine now.

32:32.283 --> 32:38.117
- Honey, what's going on? - Please, lie down, Honey.

32:38.200 --> 32:43.242
Your dad has been cheating and will have children.

32:43.325 --> 32:48.575
- Huh? What is she talking about? - What kids? How can he have children?

33:10.325 --> 33:15.575
Hi, it's Beth Halloway. Leave a message after the beep.

33:37.950 --> 33:42.033
It's ready. Your mom is gone, so you have to approve it, old man.

33:49.658 --> 33:53.158
Keep going, little boy.

34:29.755 --> 34:33.492
- Can you make an egg white omelette? - Stick and burn.

34:38.992 --> 34:44.033
- Honey's gone. - What's away? Where did she go?

34:44.117 --> 34:49.199
- I don't know. She ran away. - Claire, you should have stopped her.

34:49.283 --> 34:55.242
How do I do that? Why? And what is one egg for an omelette?

35:23.658 --> 35:26.908
No, not the stairs. Honey!

35:31.242 --> 35:33.950
Stay.

35:34.033 --> 35:37.658
Honey! I'm having a heart attack!

35:41.450 --> 35:44.783
Frlt. Did it go well?

35:44.867 --> 35:49.367
- I haven't run so long. - I recognize you again.

35:49.450 --> 35:53.033
- I got to meet my mom. - She can't meet anyone.

35:53.117 --> 35:58.617
I'm not there, you don't know who am I? I'm gonna do whatever I want!

36:00.492 --> 36:04.492
I don't know what you are doing now.

36:04.575 --> 36:08.325
You should stay with us.

36:18.617 --> 36:23.700
I thought so, but I wanted to wait for your exams.

36:23.783 --> 36:28.742
- My exams were in November. - Yeah, I know, but ...

36:28.825 --> 36:33.783
Then it was Harriet's concert and then it was Christmas.

36:35.742 --> 36:39.950
I love you so much too.

36:41.033 --> 36:46.825
You realize how ironic it is that you have written self-helping books?

37:05.033 --> 37:10.700
- I wanted to meet the girls. - You just have to see a lawyer.

37:10.783 --> 37:15.408
Of course, that wasn't the only thing you got cheap in the health food business.

37:15.492 --> 37:18.950
Keisha asked me to tell the truth.

37:19.033 --> 37:25.200
- Keisha? Is her name Keisha? - She's ashamed of it. Me too.

37:25.283 --> 37:29.950
No one over 25 is named Keisha. How old is she?

37:31.117 --> 37:33.742
What does it matter?

37:33.825 --> 37:38.367
She's half your age and she bears your child.

37:38.450 --> 37:43.742
- We had separate bedrooms. - Before you arrive late after the "job".

37:43.825 --> 37:48.617
- You did. Is not everything my fault. - Yes, it really is.

37:48.700 --> 37:54.242
You couldn't make an effort my behalf? Get your own? Look at you!

37:55.283 --> 38:00.408
I chased my escaped niece. I should have been dressed better.

38:00.492 --> 38:03.325
That would be the first time!

38:03.408 --> 38:07.575
Did you get any pregnant? for not dressing up?

38:10.492 --> 38:14.242
Because you didn't love me.

38:14.325 --> 38:20.908
- I stayed with you for all those years! - It's not love, but perseverance!

38:20.992 --> 38:25.658
Do you know who you are? You're that guy!

38:25.742 --> 38:31.033
- The guy in the French movie! - The one with the dinner party?

38:31.117 --> 38:37.742
- He on the bus? - No, the old one who sticks!

38:37.825 --> 38:42.908
He understands his brother-in-law's life!

38:46.658 --> 38:49.908
There is no danger.

38:53.742 --> 38:58.033
I don't think I saw it.

38:58.117 --> 39:02.658
How's everything else?

39:33.242 --> 39:38.908
Hi. Mick Croyston with C.

39:38.992 --> 39:44.492
We're looking at the police station. I called, but you don't call.

39:44.575 --> 39:49.325
No danger, I'm just checking that everything is ready for tomorrow.

39:49.408 --> 39:53.950
- Tomorrow? - Honey's photo shoot.

39:54.033 --> 39:59.367
- Yeah. Unfortunately, it hasn't been. - Yes. I booked a studio.

39:59.450 --> 40:04.033
My sister was dead and arrested when she agreed ...

40:04.117 --> 40:07.617
- It's getting rid of it. - No, I'll work.

40:07.700 --> 40:12.117
I don't want to shoot you. Ngonsin. Beth pays me well.

40:12.200 --> 40:17.408
Honey, are you in there? I want to ask about the deposit, for ...

40:26.367 --> 40:27.992
Mother!

40:31.158 --> 40:35.783
There's a guy in the tree with a camera.--------------Got you.

40:52.283 --> 40:55.825
Hi. I had to find Honey myself.

40:55.908 --> 41:00.575
It wasn't Honey, but my daughter. Which testicle do you want to keep?

41:00.658 --> 41:03.242
Lucky she didn't take the grass trimmer.

41:07.950 --> 41:14.242
- Delete the pictures. - If I get the plot with Honey.

41:14.325 --> 41:19.700
You know what you have to do. Come to the studio at 14.

41:19.783 --> 41:24.117
- Do you sell them otherwise? - I don't have much to choose.

41:28.283 --> 41:33.783
What do you think I'm getting for it? She has your eyes.

41:36.242 --> 41:40.367
What are you doing? Oh my God! Stop!

41:40.450 --> 41:42.992
Are you crazy?

41:52.700 --> 41:56.200
Did it go well?

41:56.283 --> 41:59.325
Does your mom pay him?

41:59.408 --> 42:02.867
Keep the doors locked and the blinds down.

42:02.950 --> 42:06.200
If you go, then I'm alone.

42:06.283 --> 42:09.533
I really had to get to work.

42:11.992 --> 42:16.408
Caroline is getting through theirs sub-paragraphs and definitions-

42:16.492 --> 42:20.992
- and is working with their tricky clause 35A.

42:21.755 --> 42:24.575
Caroline?

42:24.658 --> 42:29.617
- Clause 35A suggests ... - Excuse me, what's up with her?

42:34.242 --> 42:38.117
My trainee wants the boys to learn.

42:38.200 --> 42:43.533
- Caroline, I'm sighing. - Seeking knowledge.

42:43.617 --> 42:48.867
- She should make us company. His. - It's probably not a good idea.

42:58.783 --> 43:02.783
Who's hiring the trainees?

43:02.867 --> 43:08.742
Where was I now? Clause 35A. They suggest ...

43:08.825 --> 43:15.658
- Caroline, it sure is urgent. - Sorry, things are going fast.

43:15.742 --> 43:20.783
- Hello? - Mindi. Which is your spouse.

43:20.867 --> 43:25.117
- I'm at work. - Yes, Honey wrote it.

43:25.200 --> 43:30.658
- What's so urgent? - Cituela from Citibank is with us.

43:30.742 --> 43:35.783
Hi, Caroline. Consuela from Citibank. Confirm a purchase of $ 20,000.

43:35.867 --> 43:40.200
Beth confirms all purchases over 10,000, but she's not here.

43:40.283 --> 43:44.992
- What did she buy? - A handbag from Hermes Birkin.

43:45.775 --> 43:48.617
The clause is important, to ...

43:48.700 --> 43:51.908
If you don't have it ...

43:55.492 --> 44:00.783
If you scroll to page 57 ... No, 56.

44:02.242 --> 44:07.325
- That was page 57. - Page seriously? That's my money!

44:10.325 --> 44:13.575
You don't put 20,000 on a bag.

44:13.658 --> 44:18.658
You're notsay no. It's for mom.

44:18.742 --> 44:23.408
- Why are you buying things for her? - She's sick.

44:23.492 --> 44:28.408
Sorry, Roger. I have problems with left eye.

44:29.783 --> 44:34.742
- Your trainee should call. - I'll be back after lunch.

44:38.658 --> 44:42.283
She can stay with you for some nights?

44:44.742 --> 44:50.283
- You have a room now. - Thanks. She refuses to sleep there.

44:50.367 --> 44:55.242
- She's scared to be alone. - Hello Alex! Oh, a rabbit!

44:55.325 --> 45:00.867
- Will she sleep with us? - Can I take the rabbit to my mom?

45:00.950 --> 45:05.117
- She belongs to someone. - Can I buy her from them?

45:05.200 --> 45:10.325
- She and the family love each other. - Oh, I also need to cuddle.

45:10.408 --> 45:15.158
It sounds cool. Let's not talk with Caroline about wedding dresses?

45:15.242 --> 45:18.742
No, I don't want to talk about it now.

45:18.825 --> 45:22.533
- Before I keep the rabbit? - She thinks she's thick.

45:22.617 --> 45:25.158

45:25.242 --> 45:29.075
- What's wrong with her? - She's going to lose weight.

45:29.158 --> 45:33.242
No, not you. The rabbit will lose weight. That bunny!

45:33.325 --> 45:39.533
The rabbit should get some rest now. I'm not going to kill it.

45:39.617 --> 45:45.450
Even though it steals to me. The rabbit is thick. You're the top.

45:45.533 --> 45:48.450
Wait for me, Alex.

45:48.533 --> 45:52.700
I can't have her at home or on the job.

45:52.783 --> 45:59.242
- Alex wouldn't be unfaithful. - You thought that about Richard too.

46:05.825 --> 46:11.325

46:19.325 --> 46:23.575
- So you attacked him? God, Caroline! - He threatened to use them.

Yes.

47:03.575 --> 47:08.908

47:10.283 --> 47:14.783
- How could they kick her? - I know...

47:14.867 --> 47:20.867
She kicks the gardener before we givefta us in a wild garden.

47:20.950 --> 47:24.200
We know she has a rake.

47:26.117 --> 47:31.492
Look, there you are. You're really blonde.

47:31.575 --> 47:38.325
- Yes, you haven't seen it. - I saw it online, like everyone else.

47:38.408 --> 47:42.325
Together with your aunt's breakdown. Is she unstable?

47:42.408 --> 47:47.283
- Joshua, all is well. - Jas...? I do not know...

47:47.367 --> 47:51.825
Breaking windshields is not healthy. And your hair ...

47:51.908 --> 47:57.283
- Do not you like? - Are you kidding? Honey, I love it.

47:57.367 --> 48:04.158
But I like your red hair too I'm worried about what fans should think.

48:04.242 --> 48:09.742
- They also love your red hair. - Mom said we can ask about it.

48:09.825 --> 48:15.367
I want to know what else she says, but she doesn't answer the phone.

48:23.325 --> 48:26.783
Do you have to keep it? I have to work.

Harriet, before I ask you to view for a thing?

48:44.950 --> 48:49.242
- Hello? - Is Beth on detox?

- You should take care of Honey. - Should he continue to shoot her?

48:59.742 --> 49:04.367

- It's actually normal. - If you stay home.

52:23.575 --> 52:28.158
- It happens when you have a child. - You should change pants.

52:28.242 --> 52:33.867
It's getting worse. I have bursts, car rings and skin you can knead.

52:33.950 --> 52:37.075
Do you want to know? Or see my tits?

52:37.158 --> 52:42.033
No, no one needs to see them. They are like two empty booze bags.

52:42.117 --> 52:48.283
They are so long and flat that I can fold them into a bra.

52:48.367 --> 52:54.742
Richard is about to get stomach and chest pain and gets gray.

52:54.825 --> 52:59.492

That body has never seen a treadmill.

53:23.950 --> 53:28.117
- When do I get my phone? - When you communicate.

53:28.200 --> 53:33.325
I communicate. I hate you. Look, now I communicated.

53:36.575 --> 53:42.533
- Can't we do it here? - Why is that?

53:53.492 --> 53:59.533
- I have someone doing it there. - Still? Does he fix the roses?

53:59.617 --> 54:03.283

- We have a great taste for taste. - But please ... Right?

56:05.533 --> 56:10.075
You cook, you don't give people the view back.

Taste is as important as vision. People need beautiful food.

No, people need food.

59:39.242 --> 59:45.408
When she went crazy. I searched for aunt Beth's aunt.

59:49.158 --> 59:53.367
I know, it was stupid. I should have done it properly.

Harriet? Honey?

01:01:04.533 --> 01:01:10.117
Why do you let her come to the bakery? Why did you say yes?

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.908
People say: "What, do you have the same genes?"

01:01:13.992 --> 01:01:17.408
- What the hell? Why didn't you wait? - Did you go to the bakery?

Mom told me to say it if people asked why we ended.

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:14.408
- Ryan ended me. - Did you kiss strangers?

01:02:14.492 --> 01:02:18.075
Because I didn't have sex with him.

01:02:18.158 --> 01:02:23.492

I dislike your video before it gets nasty.

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:43.658
- You let guys lick on you. - We just had fun.

01:02:43.742 --> 01:02:49.825

Hi, Caroline. That's right my daughters Amelia and Meg.

01:03:09.908 --> 01:03:12.783
Hi.

01:03:14.033 --> 01:03:16.575
Honey said we were coming?

01:03:16.658 --> 01:03:22.367
- I forgot about it with Claire. - He's a famous chef.

01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:27.242
Open a package of Pringles. I have to change from the pajamas.

01:03:27.325 --> 01:03:30.950
One, two, three.

Thank you for making us feel good.

01:03:44.992 --> 01:03:51.200
I made a big point now. Look, the chocolate sorbet.

01:03:51.283 --> 01:03:56.075
- I'm human, not a chef. - Taste now.

01:03:57.992 --> 01:04:02.867
Yuk. I'm kidding, it was incredibly good.

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:06.200
Victory is mine.

01:04:06.283 --> 01:04:11.575
Come and show me the girls Honey or prove that the flavors work?

01:04:11.658 --> 01:04:14.742
Tv flies.

01:04:16.075 --> 01:04:22.033
Look, Meg is smiling. She never smiles.

01:04:22.117 --> 01:04:26.283
She smiles, but I'm worried that she is not happy.

01:04:26.367 --> 01:04:32.117
That she can't be happy. Is that what we want our children to be?

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:37.492
We have ideas on what to make, but after all,

01:04:37.575 --> 01:04:40.867
-We just want them to be happy.

01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:44.200
Want a glass of wine?

01:04:44.283 --> 01:04:48.325
- Did I say that loud? - Yes.

01:04:48.408 --> 01:04:53.242
- Yes to what? - Bade also.

01:04:53.325 --> 01:04:54.575
Okay.

01:04:55.950 --> 01:05:02.033
I was so gone that I knocked out mine brother's teeth. Before I live with that.

01:05:02.117 --> 01:05:07.242
Or he can live with it, he didn't talk to the dentist.

01:05:07.325 --> 01:05:12.992
The point is that I lost my brother and my wife.

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:17.783
My friends. And the ability to have an erection.

01:05:17.867 --> 01:05:23.950
I must be worried about that Gavin's impotence, but I do now.

01:05:24.033 --> 01:05:29.200
- Please, please, Beth. - How does that help me?

01:05:29.283 --> 01:05:33.450
I don't want to talk to them, but with Honey. Snlla.

01:05:33.533 --> 01:05:37.992
That's the first time you pray to talk to your daughter.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:44.658
- Are you serious? - He really likes you.

01:05:44.742 --> 01:05:50.450
- He forced his number on you. - Don't let me interrupt the bastards.

01:05:52.158 --> 01:05:57.033
Mom, Amelia has instagramed you.

01:05:57.117 --> 01:06:01.867
- Is that bad? - Well, wise.

01:06:03.867 --> 01:06:08.117
One of your booze looks.

01:06:13.992 --> 01:06:18.200
Oh my God! When does it happen?

01:06:18.283 --> 01:06:21.325
How do I remove it?

01:06:21.408 --> 01:06:24.325
It doesn't.

01:06:24.408 --> 01:06:28.533
Why did you put on that dress?

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:32.242
How tragic can you get?

01:06:33.575 --> 01:06:38.908
I love you. See you. I'll get it them after the football. Hi there.

01:06:40.992 --> 01:06:45.867
- Hello. - Hello. Yes...

01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:50.783
It sounds embarrassing. This is true of Amelia's Instagram.

01:06:50.867 --> 01:06:57.533
She can't upload pictures Honey. I fixed the account to her.

01:06:57.617 --> 01:07:02.992
- No, you don't have to look. - Instagram, here we go.

01:07:03.075 --> 01:07:07.283
There is no danger. Forget it.

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:26.075
Mother!

01:07:36.325 --> 01:07:42.075
- Claire told me to come along. - Why aren't you dressed?

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:54.158
The wedding is set.

01:07:54.242 --> 01:07:59.533
- Honey, are you back on Monday? - I have the stuff to do here.

01:08:02.033 --> 01:08:05.867
What? What about stuff?

01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:10.117
You're Australia's only shit that is not in Los Angeles.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.867
We'll hear you later.

01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:17.367
What kind of stuff, Honey? I'm your stuff!

01:08:18.742 --> 01:08:21.742
Katie?

01:08:21.825 --> 01:08:27.533
- What a shame. - Can we stay alone for a while?

01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:40.658
- He texted Honey. - I text her once.

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:46.575
- To send a picturen on the rabbit. - Tell me what you wrote.

01:08:46.658 --> 01:08:52.533
Honey wrote:"Does it have that, the fat rabbit lost weight? "

01:08:52.617 --> 01:08:56.950
- He answered... - I answered...

01:08:57.033 --> 01:09:02.783
- "We have to eat these nachos, so hardly." - Like I was the fat rabbit!

01:09:02.867 --> 01:09:07.450
Not thick! You're like a Playboy rabbit.

01:09:07.533 --> 01:09:10.992
No money in mind.

01:09:11.075 --> 01:09:18.033
- Do you set the wedding over it? - You have no idea how humiliated I am.

01:09:21.617 --> 01:09:24.617
Yes, you look.

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:28.158
Booked! The studio is called Please Cheese Me.

01:09:28.242 --> 01:09:34.492
- What more are there? - Just a text message about the rabbit.

01:09:34.575 --> 01:09:37.908
That's it.

01:09:37.992 --> 01:09:43.283
- "Please Cheese Me" studio? - I have to, for the sake of my mother.

01:09:43.367 --> 01:09:48.783
- He photographed Claire. - No. Yes. I trust him.

01:09:48.867 --> 01:09:53.367
- Are you gonna let him take you naked? - Huh? No.

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:58.867
He didn't say you had to be naked? Ask him.

01:10:02.575 --> 01:10:06.700
Serve, good looking. How is it?

01:10:06.783 --> 01:10:11.408
Hi. That photo shoot ...

01:10:11.492 --> 01:10:17.283
- Just what should I wear? - Nothing.

01:10:17.367 --> 01:10:23.825
Hot pineapple! We can laugh with some supplies.

01:10:23.908 --> 01:10:28.742
We can take springs. I have a whip that can be fun.

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:34.117
But your mom wants to show off what God has given you.

01:10:35.325 --> 01:10:40.033
Seriously? Nude Photos?

01:10:41.908 --> 01:10:47.117
One million hits in a day. She was high on tablets.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:53.117
It's okay to take nude pictures of you so that she becomes more knowledgeable? Fy.

01:10:56.242 --> 01:11:01.950
No ... Whatever the pill, think about it all the other crazy shit she's done.

01:11:02.033 --> 01:11:06.408
- Like she wrote the book. - Forget the book, kid.

01:11:06.492 --> 01:11:12.408
- What!!, after what she wrote? - Claire, there will be no lesson now!

01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:15.867
It's not Claire.

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:24.033
- Did Mom tell you to drive? - I have my own car in Los Angeles.

01:11:24.117 --> 01:11:27.325
You're on the wrong side of the road.

01:11:29.325 --> 01:11:32.533
Where's Harriet?

01:11:45.117 --> 01:11:50.700
- Did it go well? - Fuck! Fuck me!

01:11:50.783 --> 01:11:55.908
Are you injured? Not? Good. Pack your stuff.

01:11:55.992 --> 01:12:00.367
Come here. Come on.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:07.700
Married is somewhere else.

01:12:49.158 --> 01:12:54.408
- Hi mom. Are you out? - No, honey. I'm still there.

01:12:54.492 --> 01:12:58.658
h, what I miss you, old man.

01:12:58.742 --> 01:13:03.700
- Honey, are you still there? - Why do you let the guys lick me?

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:11.117
- Huh? What boys? - The guys licking me.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.992
Looks like I'm having sex in the barn.

01:13:16.075 --> 01:13:21.867
- Do you want people to think I have sex? - In the barn? What?

01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:27.117
It was you who spread the rumor that I operated on the breast?

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:33.825
- Why are you here? - You asked me to photograph me naked.

01:13:34.867 --> 01:13:40.742
- It ... She's a famous photographer. - I mean Mick.

01:13:40.825 --> 01:13:45.158
How desperate you wanted that I would show myself naked?

01:13:45.242 --> 01:13:50.408
You used the call you got when you were called to call him.

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:57.200
I was high, darling. I needed to No lawyer, Caroline was there.

01:13:57.283 --> 01:14:02.492
Mom, the mistake was you didn't call me!

01:14:19.867 --> 01:14:24.283
- How did you come up here? - The name you live under was simple.

01:14:24.367 --> 01:14:28.117
"Miss monkey girl"? Really?

01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:34.533
- How's Harriet? - She's ashamed that you got the boost.

01:14:34.617 --> 01:14:39.825
- I deserved it. - I just wanted to say ......

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:46.450
... that I'm not angry about Liam. He SMS:ade "loses" a million times.

01:14:46.533 --> 01:14:52.533
If your mom is booking nude photos I understand your weird view of guys.

01:14:52.617 --> 01:14:57.908
I'm thinking about the photo shoot and have approved the video.

01:14:57.992 --> 01:15:04.283
Your mother protected Harriet and lost job to protect you.

01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:08.033
So moms should do.

01:15:08.117 --> 01:15:12.325
Mom has not protected me throughout my life.

01:15:12.408 --> 01:15:16.825
I'm not her daughter, but nothing that makes her known.

01:15:16.908 --> 01:15:19.492
Now she's going to get real.

01:15:23.783 --> 01:15:28.908
- Mindi, I can't get Caroline. - Honey is back at the hotel.

01:15:28.992 --> 01:15:34.158
Honey asked me not to tell, but it makes me feel sick.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:45.242
A million hits in a day? Would nude pictures give a million hits?

01:15:45.325 --> 01:15:51.825
- Fuck, Joshua. I was tall. - Then I look at Cheech and Chong.

01:15:51.908 --> 01:15:54.950
What about single?

01:15:55.033 --> 01:15:59.700
I'll fix it here, then I'll sue you.

01:16:04.117 --> 01:16:10.950
I'm trying to get the job back. Only I understand the Singapore business.

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:14.200
I'm sorry you lost it.

01:16:16.367 --> 01:16:19.658
Okay.

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:24.200
- Honey's doing the photo shoot. - How do you know that?

01:16:24.283 --> 01:16:29.950
I went to the hotel. She wants to be met at Beth.

01:16:30.033 --> 01:16:35.617
- You have to stop her, Mom. - I'm not the family's work ant.

01:16:40.075 --> 01:16:46.742
- Hello. I want to meet Monkey Girl. - Unfortunately, nobody lives like this.

01:16:46.825 --> 01:16:51.950
Yes, you probably have. Please check.

01:16:52.033 --> 01:16:57.283
Someone lived here under that name, but she asked to change.

01:17:10.408 --> 01:17:15.533
It's Honey and me. Honey is Honey at my house.

01:17:15.617 --> 01:17:20.825
It's the dog. She loves it and the house.

01:17:20.908 --> 01:17:25.325
- She loves me! - They still love the name.

01:17:28.908 --> 01:17:32.700
It's early, but you've been visiting.

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:38.408
I got the message.

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:48.742
- We're taking Beth with us. - What, we help her escape?

01:17:48.825 --> 01:17:53.575
Of course, we're going to help your family, but with cookie sales or chores.

01:17:53.658 --> 01:17:57.867
We need a diversion. What do we have in the glove compartment?

01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:02.117
Nothing. Instruction manual and hand cream.

01:18:09.825 --> 01:18:16.575
Gerald, I need help. Hurry up. Get him up.

01:18:17.867 --> 01:18:22.658
I have problems. Big problems.

01:18:28.075 --> 01:18:32.658
- I'm sorry. - What have you taken?

01:18:32.742 --> 01:18:35.908
Tropical hand cream.

01:18:35.992 --> 01:18:39.617
Can I get a bucket?

01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:58.158
Where is she going? Where is she going? Follow the hybrid car.

01:19:05.158 --> 01:19:09.867
- They can describe me to the police. - Yes, you can smell bad.

01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:15.825
Listen, your darling. So was Honey, otherwise you need pain relief.

01:19:15.908 --> 01:19:19.617
Hall? Hall?

01:19:21.742 --> 01:19:24.950
Hi, Beth.

01:19:25.033 --> 01:19:30.325
Oh, I forgot the math book. Hey, we're gonna take the next bus.

01:19:30.408 --> 01:19:35.700
Is it safe? Okay, wish me luck.

01:19:39.783 --> 01:19:44.492
Don't play now, but we're not going to school.

01:19:50.575 --> 01:19:55.575
- Beth, he probably wants to talk to you. - Oh my God.

01:19:55.658 --> 01:20:00.033
- Do you know him? - It's Joshua. Ignore him.

01:20:00.117 --> 01:20:05.367
- I'm trying to drive. Get him away. - Me? Better hand cream.

01:20:07.658 --> 01:20:11.200
- Hi. - Was Honey, Beth?

01:20:11.283 --> 01:20:17.200
- It's me who can help her. - It's been brilliant so far!

01:20:17.283 --> 01:20:23.700
Hi tempo, packet! - she adds you can forget the "monkey girl"!

01:20:23.783 --> 01:20:29.367
- No, my sister is helping me. - Caroline? You're good!

01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:35.575
- No, I'm Katie. - The other one? You're not thick!

01:20:36.783 --> 01:20:41.242
- Thanks! - What are you doing, puck?

01:20:41.325 --> 01:20:46.825
I know I was irrational. You were all right to be angry.

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:49.492
Thanks.

01:20:50.783 --> 01:20:53.825
Out.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:00.950
- I attack you. Bring me back. - I thought I'd call you.

01:21:01.033 --> 01:21:03.867
Singapore is a disaster.

01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:08.742
Charles! Were you, cockhead?

01:21:12.575 --> 01:21:15.575
Is it really here?

01:21:17.117 --> 01:21:21.283
What are we doing now?

01:21:50.825 --> 01:21:53.617
Your cousins â€‹â€‹are here.

01:21:59.658 --> 01:22:02.242
The fans. Peel them away.

01:22:04.825 --> 01:22:09.825
Write on it. We have to have a crane

01:22:09.908 --> 01:22:16.325
- you don't hit more cars. D we sue you for our rumors.

01:22:17.492 --> 01:22:22.700
- We're not Coca-Cola right now. - Don't be naive, Caroline.

01:22:22.783 --> 01:22:27.700
The brand of the company You're bigger than you. Bigger one of us all.

01:22:29.158 --> 01:22:33.617
She's fine. Claire. 16-ring which was photographed in lingerie.

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:36.992
Jttebra. Hr.

01:22:37.075 --> 01:22:43.158
Someone is taking photos into my daughter's bedroom and I will protect the company?

01:22:43.242 --> 01:22:48.033
- Your daughter is not my problem. - Why not?

01:22:48.117 --> 01:22:55.033
How can you ignore it that a child was photographed naked?

01:22:55.117 --> 01:23:01.617
- Yes. - Tell me if I was ignorant!

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:06.950
Drive up the brand in the ass, hope that it is as big as you say!

01:23:07.033 --> 01:23:12.492
- Charles, we're starting our own. - Should I call you, right?

01:23:19.992 --> 01:23:23.033
Get them going.

01:23:24.783 --> 01:23:29.283
Stick, otherwise I'll call the police.

01:23:37.492 --> 01:23:40.325
Dad?

01:23:52.033 --> 01:23:56.825
Honey's bad looking. My car's on workshop. Before I borrow your scooter?

01:23:56.908 --> 01:24:02.325
- Sure. Do you have a driving license for it? - Do you need a driver's license?

01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:11.283
Yes, I know where it is! Move it so we don't!

01:24:11.367 --> 01:24:16.533
- Can you drive a little faster? - It is old, it is max in 35.

01:24:16.617 --> 01:24:20.617
- Lets go before. - Can't you do a little?

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:25.117
I didn't realize you were embarrassed.

01:24:26.367 --> 01:24:31.200
I didn't realize I looked so funny naked. I have to leave now.

01:24:31.283 --> 01:24:35.158
Okay, but do you need the helmet?

01:24:36.408 --> 01:24:41.200
- At 300 meters, Katie. - Joshyou remain.

01:24:41.283 --> 01:24:46.908
- What if he kicks her? - Lost, win about 150.

01:24:46.992 --> 01:24:50.325
Why did you find everything, Beth?

01:24:50.408 --> 01:24:55.117
- Come on, you were chubby as a kid. - Chubby?

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:02.283
You always had a cake in your mouth. You and mom always baked together.

01:25:02.367 --> 01:25:05.992
She was sick and let you eat.

01:25:06.075 --> 01:25:10.992
- 25 meters, baby. - You were jealous of me.

01:25:11.075 --> 01:25:14.450
- I wasn't at all. - Win!

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.575
No, right.

01:25:35.242 --> 01:25:38.575
Shouldn't we wait for Dad?

01:25:38.658 --> 01:25:43.533
- What if he called the police. - They had been here by now.

01:25:53.408 --> 01:25:58.075
- It's worse than the police. - What are you doing here?

01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:10.325
You have to get good at the windowsill.

01:26:18.033 --> 01:26:21.325
Claire?

01:26:36.075 --> 01:26:39.283
Okay, are you ready?

01:26:44.992 --> 01:26:48.450
So, yes, there we have Honey!

01:26:48.533 --> 01:26:51.117
No, Honey!

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:55.658
- I think somebody was screaming. - Hurry up!

01:26:55.742 --> 01:26:59.575
- Miss, Caroline. - Yeah, get lost.

01:26:59.658 --> 01:27:02.658
Get on you, Honey.

01:27:04.450 --> 01:27:08.117
I ... I'll be right away.

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.117
Get rid of the bathrobe.

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:16.658
- Thank goodness you are here. - No! My God, she's done it!

01:27:16.742 --> 01:27:20.908
God, she's done it. Then we tear the contract.

01:27:20.992 --> 01:27:24.242
The movie does not get rid of. The deal is broken.

01:27:24.325 --> 01:27:29.533
I'm suing you. Every one of them is.

01:27:29.617 --> 01:27:34.700
- Joshua? - Caroline? Congratulations!

01:27:34.783 --> 01:27:38.075
"Monkey girl" is dead. Apparently dead.

01:27:38.158 --> 01:27:41.533
The birds in the tree are dead. Utdda.

01:27:41.617 --> 01:27:45.408
Just like my movie series! Hi there!

01:27:45.492 --> 01:27:50.242
- How's that? We can fix it right here. - What are you doing here?

01:27:50.325 --> 01:27:54.492
Did Joshua get you out? - Katie? What's going on?

01:27:54.575 --> 01:27:59.117
- Beth, don't make sure you've escaped. - She must be back soon, just.

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:05.242
- Did you help her escape? How? - Hand cream and drama lessons.

01:28:05.325 --> 01:28:10.158
- Why does he have a syringe? - I'm a veterinarian. She brought.

01:28:10.242 --> 01:28:14.742
- I'm not kidnapped. - There will be no photo shoot.

01:28:14.825 --> 01:28:18.367
Good. I don't want to do abuse.

01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:24.325
Honey, get on you. We won't let go single, so the photos are not needed.

01:28:24.408 --> 01:28:29.075
- The bestDon't you? - Yes. I made a mistake.

01:28:29.158 --> 01:28:31.783
You get fired.

01:28:31.867 --> 01:28:36.867
I don't need to be your manager, but I am your mother.

01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:40.367
When have you been a mother to me?

01:28:41.825 --> 01:28:47.158
Now. Please darling, don't do it right.

01:28:47.242 --> 01:28:52.700
- It is too late. - He has already taken pictures.

01:28:52.783 --> 01:28:57.825
I'm not paying you. I don't approve.

01:28:57.908 --> 01:29:03.492
I don't need a loan. I have pictures by Monkey Girl in just the brass.

01:29:03.575 --> 01:29:07.783
Wait until the gossip press sees them.

01:29:07.867 --> 01:29:12.242
Good. So everyone can go now.

01:29:15.033 --> 01:29:19.783
- How much can you get for them? - 200,000, 250,000, let it.

01:29:24.283 --> 01:29:28.617
- What are you doing? - Mick's right. Here's how it sells.

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.908
Which? Pictures of you? No.

01:29:31.992 --> 01:29:37.617
- I'm broke. I need money. - It doesn't look right.

01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:42.950
- You did. Do you take family photos? - Not with the family's knowledge.

01:29:43.033 --> 01:29:47.700
Come on, Katie and Alex. The wedding doesn't pay for itself.

01:29:47.783 --> 01:29:51.992
- Aunts and uncles first. - Photoshop can't fix you.

01:29:52.075 --> 01:29:58.200
It is not necessary. We can earn lots on inconvenient family pictures.

01:29:58.283 --> 01:30:02.325
- Mom, you're crazy. - No, she's right.

01:30:02.408 --> 01:30:09.158
Wedding coordinators are expensive, We need the money.

01:30:09.242 --> 01:30:14.117
- What are you going to get for them? - I'll show you, Beth.

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:19.658
I can do something about it. You should see the shit the Italians are buying.

01:30:19.742 --> 01:30:25.242
- Really. - You went crazy over a pussy.

01:30:25.325 --> 01:30:30.908
I know, Honey. But I have not been completely honest with me myself.

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:36.700
I like my breasts. Richard is not a fan.

01:30:36.783 --> 01:30:41.617
But they both loved to suck on them. People like different things.

01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:47.908
- I like my toys. - I agree with you.

01:30:47.992 --> 01:30:50.908
I'm not Ryan Phillippe myself.

01:30:50.992 --> 01:30:55.325
I have no butt at all. At the job, they call me the snake.

01:30:55.408 --> 01:31:00.700
We start with the sisters at the vet.

01:31:00.783 --> 01:31:04.700
No, we start with a Beth.

01:31:04.783 --> 01:31:08.825
So focus right.

01:31:08.908 --> 01:31:12.742
Really gorgeous. Sweet and sour.

01:31:12.825 --> 01:31:15.450
Beautifully.

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:26.158
- I knocked him out. - With the syringe. The shell was bad.

01:31:26.242 --> 01:31:31.658
No, it wasn't. My face Plastic, I knew nothing.

01:31:31.742 --> 01:31:38.867
- That was unbelievable. - Honey, told me I was going crazy.

01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:45.117
You broke out and changed your face. You really wanted to save the Monkey Girl.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:50.783
It wasn't for Monkey Girls. I don't mind if you work more.

01:31:50.867 --> 01:31:55.158
- Please tell me, baby. - Thanks!

01:31:55.242 --> 01:32:01.408
Are you kidding? I loved it. What is he doing here?

01:32:02.992 --> 01:32:06.283
Oh my God.

01:32:09.075 --> 01:32:14.450
- Hello. - Hello. I wanted to check that everything was okay.

01:32:15.533 --> 01:32:21.575
- If everything was okay with you. - Yes, everything is good.

01:32:21.658 --> 01:32:24.492
Thanks.

01:32:24.575 --> 01:32:29.367
- Is your family always here? - I hope so.

01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:34.783
- I still need my pants. - Okay. Just so you know ...

01:32:37.117 --> 01:32:43.658
... so I like them. The toys.

01:32:45.992 --> 01:32:50.117
I've only seen one, but the other man's promise.

01:32:58.617 --> 01:33:02.492
Also called "omelette".

01:33:02.575 --> 01:33:05.867
It's not yours.

01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:09.908
- It's not yours either. - It's mine.

01:33:09.992 --> 01:33:16.117
No, it's mine. I keep things in the family.

01:33:17.242 --> 01:33:20.783
My daughter will inherit it.

01:33:58.450 --> 01:34:01.158
Jttefint. Good.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.700
Hello dear.

01:34:19.658 --> 01:34:25.367
- Don't get it wrong, but ... Stop it. - I'm hungry.

01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:38.492
- I want to show Katie. - You shouldn't see the dressing.

01:34:38.575 --> 01:34:41.825
He's had it on him.

01:34:41.908 --> 01:34:46.492
It sounds better when Honey singing alone. But it goes like this.

01:34:46.575 --> 01:34:51.533
I know you wanted pigeons, but it gets better.

01:34:51.617 --> 01:34:54.658
Get out the rabbits!

01:34:54.742 --> 01:35:01.533
- How nice. Where are they from? - Do you remember the thick rabbit?

01:35:01.617 --> 01:35:08.075
- Was the thick rabbit pregnant? - Actually, it still is.

01:35:08.158 --> 01:35:12.950
- Huh? - He means me.

01:35:14.408 --> 01:35:18.450
We are with rabbits!
