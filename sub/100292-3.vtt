00:14.000 --> 00:17.880
<i>No! </i>

00:18.360 --> 00:20.480
No!

00:20.560 --> 00:21.480
Hello.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.800
I've been dying to meet you.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.160
Count Dracula,

00:28.480 --> 00:29.360
have you eaten?

00:31.080 --> 00:32.800
I've worked up an appetite.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.760
-Good thing there are two of you.
-No.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.360
Under no circumstances
are there two of us.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.400
Take Mina, lose me.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.160
I know you don't like to drink
the blood of the dead.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.760
You'd die to save this terrified child?

00:45.840 --> 00:48.520
-I'd die to save any terrified child.
-Why?

00:48.600 --> 00:49.960
Because I'm not like you.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.920
There's a nobler purpose to my life
than simply prolonging it.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.880
Settle for her
or take me and learn something.

00:59.880 --> 01:00.800
Run.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.120
Go, now!

01:10.160 --> 01:12.640
Agatha Van Helsing,

01:12.720 --> 01:15.560
I'm going to make you last.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.640
You'll be part of me.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.960
You'll travel to the New World
in my veins.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.720
Come, boy, suckle.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.960
When did you get in?
I didn't hear you.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.720
Ugh. Close the curtains, would you, love?

03:53.480 --> 03:54.480
Who are you?

03:59.280 --> 04:01.320
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.240
What are you doing here? Who are you?

04:03.320 --> 04:05.640
-Um--
-Are you a friend of Bob's?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.800
Oh, God, did you have to bring him home?
Sorry.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.280
He invited me in.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.960
What's the state of him?

04:14.320 --> 04:15.600
He's downstairs.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.600
Drunk?

04:18.680 --> 04:21.040
Well, that's certainly one way
of putting it.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.720
What the bloody hell is going on?

04:32.040 --> 04:33.240
Shh.

04:34.640 --> 04:35.480
Bob?

04:36.440 --> 04:37.320
Where's Bob?

04:39.680 --> 04:40.520
What?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.960
What've you done to me fridge?

04:45.480 --> 04:47.160
Is the fridge the white box?

04:48.160 --> 04:49.000
Yeah.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.600
Bob's in the fridge.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.920
It took a bit of folding.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.840
Look at her.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.160
So... So beautiful.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.400
Oh.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.080
He's alive.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.600
Oh, please, you mustn't worry.
He definitely isn't.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.600
Just a bit restless.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.240
Welcome to England, Count Dracula.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.360
What kept you?

06:05.720 --> 06:07.400
Are you hungry?

06:10.880 --> 06:11.760
Agatha?

06:26.320 --> 06:27.400
How long?

06:28.760 --> 06:30.920
Do you need to feed now?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.880
How long was I in the water?

06:34.040 --> 06:36.640
One hundred and twenty-three years.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.680
Is that all?

06:48.360 --> 06:49.560
I'm sorry?

06:51.880 --> 06:53.240
Ah!

06:55.560 --> 06:58.120
You've been busy. I like the flying thing.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.480
What about this one over here?
Does that fly too?

07:01.560 --> 07:02.880
No, that doesn't fly.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.480
Okay, I think we've got this.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.920
-You can head back.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

07:06.600 --> 07:08.000
<i>Departing.</i>

07:20.400 --> 07:21.640
You're not her, are you?

07:23.560 --> 07:25.080
But it's the same bloodline.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.200
Unmistakable.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.800
Ah.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.280
<i>-May I see that?</i>
-Stand your ground, soldier!

07:33.360 --> 07:34.520
It's not a weapon.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.920
No, of course not. It's a camera.
May I see it?

07:37.400 --> 07:38.440
Give it to him.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.280
Yeah.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.520
Boo!

07:45.360 --> 07:46.640
How did you recognize it?

07:46.960 --> 07:49.200
It can't look like any camera
you've ever seen.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.000
I've been around since the 15th century.
Things change.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.640
<i>You get used to it.</i>

07:55.640 --> 07:58.840
You do seem to be accelerating, though.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.040
Very good.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.440
<i>Smile.</i>

08:03.520 --> 08:04.640
Ah.

08:04.720 --> 08:05.600
Please.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.320
I'm sure you have a very pretty smile.
May I see it?

08:14.240 --> 08:15.640
Want to do it together?

08:16.120 --> 08:17.200
Hmm?

08:18.720 --> 08:19.560
<i>Yeah?</i>

08:20.480 --> 08:22.000
<i>Ah. Smile.</i>

08:22.080 --> 08:24.280
-There. Smile.
- Drop your weapon!

08:24.360 --> 08:25.400
-Drop yours!
-Drop it!

08:25.480 --> 08:27.000
Drop yours!

08:27.920 --> 08:30.080
Now, please have mercy and smile.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.680
I've been sleeping underwater
for more than a century.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.960
There are many advantages
to being a vampire,

08:40.840 --> 08:43.520
but it does make it hard
to be a morning person.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.520
There.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.800
That's better.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.840
You see, I'm not so bad after all.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.440
-Put it down!
-Smile.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.720
-Drop that weapon!
-Don't shoot him. Do not shoot him!

08:57.800 --> 08:59.720
- I said drop it!
-Smile.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.920
- Drop it now!
-No.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.160
I can hear your pulse.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.320
It's very lively now.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.440
Van Helsing.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.840
Descendant, I assume.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.640
Sister Agatha Van Helsing
was my great-great aunt

09:27.720 --> 09:29.120
on my father's side.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.600
I really liked her.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.280
By my understanding, you killed her.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.680
Killing is healthy competition.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.920
Mercy is disrespect.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.880
No!

09:41.960 --> 09:43.800
Sir, what are your orders?

09:52.640 --> 09:55.080
I like the noise it makes.
That's a nice touch.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.000
Listen,

09:59.840 --> 10:02.040
he's really not worth your sympathy.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.800
He enjoyed hitting you, you know.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.960
I've acquired
some of your husband's memories.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.440
I think you would say
that I've downloaded them.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.600
How?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.200
Orally.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.360
May I?

10:38.120 --> 10:41.240
- Kathleen, isn't it?
-Yeah.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.720
What's wrong with your servants, Kathleen?

10:44.800 --> 10:45.920
Is it their day off?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.600
I'm assuming you have staff.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.720
You're clearly very wealthy.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.720
- Wealthy?
- Yes.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.520
Well, look at all this stuff.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.640
All this food.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.160
The moving picture box.

11:02.840 --> 11:06.240
And that thing outside.
Bob calls it, um...

11:07.400 --> 11:08.240
a car.

11:08.880 --> 11:09.880
Is that yours?

11:11.120 --> 11:11.960
Yeah.

11:12.200 --> 11:16.040
And this treasure trove is your house.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.080
It's a dump.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.400
It's amazing.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.760
Kathleen, I've been a nobleman
for 400 years.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.200
I've lived in castles and palaces

11:27.280 --> 11:29.440
among the richest people of any age.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.880
Never... never have I stood
in greater luxury

11:32.960 --> 11:34.120
than surrounds me now.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.360
This is a chamber of marvels.

11:36.440 --> 11:40.080
There isn't a king, or queen, or emperor

11:40.160 --> 11:43.280
that I have ever known or eaten
who would step into this room

11:43.360 --> 11:45.120
and ever agree to leave it again.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.000
I knew the future would bring wonders.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.000
I did not know
it would make them ordinary.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.440
Four hundred years?

11:57.840 --> 12:01.360
Ah, sorry. Five hundred, actually.
I slept in.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.720
Who are you?

12:02.800 --> 12:03.800
I'm a vampire.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.840
No. No, don't be silly, Kathleen.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.400
You know it's true. People always know.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.600
Trust the hairs on the back of your neck.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.560
I'm the reason you have them.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.240
Now...

12:17.680 --> 12:20.040
...there usually are questions.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.080
Um...

12:29.120 --> 12:30.600
Do you have a reflection?

12:30.680 --> 12:32.280
-I'm sorry?
-In the mirror.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.000
They don't have reflections in the films,

12:37.160 --> 12:38.000
vampires.

12:38.080 --> 12:42.040
Do I look like someone
who can't see himself in the mirror? Hmm?

12:42.120 --> 12:43.120
Uh...

12:43.200 --> 12:46.920
Most of the vampire legends
are wrong or misunderstood.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.360
But mirrors...

12:56.320 --> 12:59.000
I don't see any less in the mirror
than you do.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.040
I see more.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.920
Ah! No.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.440
Do you have an orchestra?

13:20.480 --> 13:21.320
Hello?

13:21.400 --> 13:22.280
Ah.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.360
Telephone. Thank you, Bob.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.760
Who else is up there?

13:47.640 --> 13:48.520
Ah!

14:27.720 --> 14:29.000
Get in the box.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.600
<i>How did you find me?</i>

14:30.680 --> 14:33.080
It's not difficult to follow
a trail of devastation.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.560
<i>The sun is up. You need to get in the box.</i>

14:36.000 --> 14:39.880
Um... You may not have noticed,
but there's a roof over my head.

14:39.960 --> 14:40.840
<i>I've noticed.</i>

14:50.440 --> 14:52.160
Get in the box.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

14:57.600 --> 14:58.960
<i>Are you in the box?</i>

14:59.640 --> 15:00.840
Meet me downstairs.

15:15.040 --> 15:15.880
Hello?

15:17.600 --> 15:18.480
Count Dracula?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.000
Hello?

15:23.560 --> 15:24.640
Okay, I'm coming in.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.960
Keep in mind, I've got people outside.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.640
Anything happens to me,
they're gonna tear the roof off

15:33.720 --> 15:34.800
and let you burn.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.360
Hello?

15:42.200 --> 15:43.560
Where are you?

16:12.160 --> 16:13.600
Kill me!

16:13.680 --> 16:14.520
Kill me!

16:14.960 --> 16:16.240
Kill me!

16:16.320 --> 16:17.440
Kill me!

16:17.840 --> 16:18.760
Scared yet?

16:35.920 --> 16:37.160
<i>You're killing me.</i>

16:37.240 --> 16:39.160
<i> It doesn't have to hurt.</i>

17:11.400 --> 17:13.360
Get the box. Get him in the box.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.360
<i>Look at me.</i>

17:38.160 --> 17:39.520
<i>Look at me!</i>

17:55.640 --> 17:56.960
Where do we put him?

18:01.600 --> 18:03.000
Straight to isolation.

18:06.840 --> 18:07.760
Johnny?

19:03.600 --> 19:04.440
Hey.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.120
<i>Tonight. You could bring someone.</i>

19:08.040 --> 19:08.880
Who?

19:08.960 --> 19:10.760
<i>I don't know. Just bring someone.</i>

19:13.800 --> 19:16.120
<i>You're not getting</i>
<i>all sentimental on me, are you?</i>

19:16.200 --> 19:17.680
'Course not.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.720
<i>Sentimental is just stalking.</i>

19:20.400 --> 19:21.320
<i>See you later.</i>

19:24.040 --> 19:24.920
Bye.

19:48.720 --> 19:49.600
Lucy!

19:51.560 --> 19:53.480
What time did you get in last night?

19:54.040 --> 19:55.160
It's not healthy.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.880
Yeah. I'll sleep when I'm dead.

Hey!

20:48.040 --> 20:49.200
Quincey!

21:00.760 --> 21:02.480
Everyone, this is Quincey.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.120
He's an American from Texas.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.720
-Texas.
-Evenin'.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.800
Never known a cowboy before.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.600
Are you a cowboy, Quincey?

21:11.680 --> 21:14.880
-Uh... No. Not really, ma'am. No.
-Uh-huh.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.840
-"Ma'am"?
- I mean, I ride quite a bit,

21:16.920 --> 21:19.080
-but I've never really--
-He rides?

21:20.160 --> 21:22.040
Come on, cowboy. Let's dance.

21:40.720 --> 21:41.600
I need to pee.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.600
So, I never asked you what you do.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.360
Luce didn't seem sure.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.120
Like a nurse or somethin'?

22:08.560 --> 22:09.760
I'm a junior doctor.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.280
But I want to specialize in mental health.

22:14.560 --> 22:15.480
You?

22:19.360 --> 22:21.080
Lucy says you've got money.

22:22.960 --> 22:24.440
Uh...

22:24.520 --> 22:25.560
I guess.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.640
You've gotta wonder if she'd be into me
if I wasn't rich.

22:36.240 --> 22:39.400
But then,
would I like her if she was ugly?

22:48.840 --> 22:51.160
They do have actual loos here, you know.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.280
There's a queue.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.200
You're terrible.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.680
Shut up. It's quicker out here.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.440
No, I'm talking about Jack.

22:57.520 --> 22:58.440
What about Jack?

23:00.600 --> 23:02.760
Now, don't tell me you haven't seen
the look on his face.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.520
It's not like I've never shagged him.
What is he complaining about?

23:05.600 --> 23:07.320
I think he might be in love with you.

23:07.400 --> 23:08.360
Don't be daft.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.400
It was like three times.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.080
Four, depending what you count.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.280
You'll get a reputation.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.720
What?

23:16.680 --> 23:19.200
-Thank you, Queen Victoria.
-Well, you know what I mean.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.840
I do. It's called slut-shaming.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.280
Yeah, it takes one to know one.

23:22.360 --> 23:25.360
Why shouldn't I have fun?
Jesus, I'm only 22.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.120
It's not like I'm gonna marry anyone.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.600
If it's any consolation,
I think you're very cute.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.840
I mean, I know you're not gay.
I mean, obviously, what with Lucy and all.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.320
Three times, four.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.880
I mean, no, I just wanted to...

23:56.480 --> 23:58.640
Look, sorry. Sorry. I wish I'd never...

24:10.520 --> 24:12.160
Oh, my God.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.360
Yes, yes, yes!

24:25.960 --> 24:27.760
<i>Married!</i>

24:27.840 --> 24:32.360
Married! Married! Married!

24:37.320 --> 24:39.200
Well, I hope they'll be very happy.

24:40.000 --> 24:40.960
Neither do I.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.560
Want to get a drink?

24:46.320 --> 24:49.120
Yeah, but, uh... I can't.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.000
See you.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.160
Go!

26:08.160 --> 26:11.320
-I didn't have time to bring anything.
-You don't need anything.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.800
We've been trying to contact you
for hours.

26:13.880 --> 26:16.480
Sorry. I was in a club. It was noisy.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.680
So... you've actually found him.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.680
-You weren't drinking?
-I don't drink.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.720
Good. Neither does he.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.280
In here.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.320
What do I do with my clothes?

26:34.400 --> 26:35.880
Just leave them on the chair.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.280
Is this information up to date?

26:40.240 --> 26:41.960
Um... Yeah, I think so.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.760
How many of us are there?

26:47.840 --> 26:49.440
You're about to meet everyone.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.760
Here. Can you put this on, please?

26:53.520 --> 26:55.840
-Hello, Jack.
-Zoe...

26:56.920 --> 26:58.080
Dr. Helsing.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.560
-How are you feeling?
-Well, it's a big day for science.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.600
I suppose I wasn't really expecting it
on my watch.

27:03.680 --> 27:04.760
I meant, how are you?

27:05.120 --> 27:07.520
Oh. Asymptomatic so far.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.440
Trying not to think about it.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.760
I thought you were withdrawing
from the program.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.600
-I thought there was a girl.
-Yeah.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.680
I did too.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.280
Well, come on. The briefing's started.

27:32.120 --> 27:34.480
<i>So, this is the main part</i>
<i>of the ship.</i>

27:35.360 --> 27:39.600
Basically undisturbed for over 100 years.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.200
The original teams were looking
in the wrong place.

27:42.280 --> 27:44.640
No one realized quite how close

27:44.720 --> 27:47.560
Count Dracula's ship got
to the British mainland.

27:48.000 --> 27:48.840
Oh, hello.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.120
-Jack Seward.
- Hello, Jack.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.080
Sorry to be so late.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.480
Oh, don't worry.
I haven't got to the good bit yet.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.240
Another O-negative, I see?

27:58.720 --> 27:59.960
Vanilla.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.440
Welcome, Jack.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.600
There's nothing wrong with vanilla.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.840
We searched the wreck for three days,

28:08.920 --> 28:13.800
but what we were looking for
was approximately 200 yards south of it.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.560
Now, a box this old,

28:19.360 --> 28:23.240
you'd expect at least a few barnacles.

28:23.880 --> 28:24.880
But look at it.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.240
Untouched by any living thing.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.080
Well, there you are.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.680
Your life's work.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.200
You don't look so happy.

28:55.280 --> 28:58.680
Yeah. I'm as happy as the pope would be
if Jesus actually turned up.

28:58.760 --> 29:03.080
As you can see, even after 123 years,

29:03.800 --> 29:05.800
the body was perfectly preserved.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.240
Or so we thought.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.200
Oh!

29:24.280 --> 29:25.520
The body was not preserved.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.880
Dracula was, in fact, alive,

29:30.120 --> 29:31.200
though dormant.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.920
Apparently,
in some kind of restorative coma,

29:34.000 --> 29:35.840
in which he would've remained

29:35.920 --> 29:38.080
if I hadn't been stupid enough
to feed him.

29:38.960 --> 29:42.040
So, in case you're wondering,
yeah, vampire's bite.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.800
You need to know
what you're signing up for.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.720
We will keep you safe.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.440
But this isn't just about giving blood.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.160
It's not just another student drug trial.

29:56.240 --> 29:59.760
There is a reason it is better paid.

29:59.840 --> 30:04.440
Now, you will have controlled exposure
to a vampire.

30:04.520 --> 30:05.880
-Are we clear?
- Bye.

30:06.840 --> 30:09.000
Obviously, at this point,

30:09.080 --> 30:11.240
having triggered his revivification,

30:11.320 --> 30:13.760
we opted for tactical retreat.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.480
We resealed the box

30:15.560 --> 30:17.720
<i>so nothing could interfere</i>
<i>with the process,</i>

30:17.800 --> 30:19.440
<i>and we monitored from the shore.</i>

30:19.520 --> 30:23.400
<i>It took Dracula another ten hours</i>
<i>to fully revive.</i>

30:23.480 --> 30:26.600
<i>And of course, we were waiting for him</i>
<i>on the beach.</i>

30:26.680 --> 30:27.600
Why?

30:33.320 --> 30:34.200
Did you hear me?

30:34.640 --> 30:36.080
Why is that there?

30:36.720 --> 30:37.840
What is it for?

30:38.920 --> 30:40.080
It's a toilet.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.360
I'm a vampire.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.400
Why have you given me a toilet?

30:49.120 --> 30:52.160
Good morning, Count Dracula.
How are you settling in?

30:53.160 --> 30:57.400
Well, uh, I have
a chemical toilet and this.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.640
You have every book written
during your coma and somewhere to sit.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.760
Well, I need more than books, Zoe.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.680
Take off your coat
and roll up your left sleeve.

31:33.080 --> 31:33.920
Why?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.520
Because I told you to
and I can break you with a sunbeam.

31:43.520 --> 31:44.360
I'm coming in.

31:44.840 --> 31:47.640
Make any attempt to attack me,
and my colleague will fully open the roof

31:47.720 --> 31:49.680
and burn you to a crisp.
Do you understand?

31:49.760 --> 31:51.320
So, you're a doctor this time, are you?

31:52.400 --> 31:56.080
I think I preferred the disappointed nun.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.080
I'm a scientist.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.080
Well, that amounts to the same thing.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.520
I'm not Sister Agatha.

32:00.600 --> 32:01.560
I'm Dr. Helsing,

32:01.640 --> 32:03.440
and I'm the woman
in charge of this foundation.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.800
In charge of it?

32:04.880 --> 32:05.880
Oh, of course.

32:05.960 --> 32:08.320
I suppose women's rights
are just something you slept through.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.880
Women's what? Did you say rights?

32:10.960 --> 32:12.640
-You'll get the hang of it.
-No, no, no.

32:12.720 --> 32:16.200
Please try and explain.
I missed an entire century.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.160
What are rights?

32:18.240 --> 32:20.520
Nobody has rights, Zoe.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.280
Man, woman, or monster.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.680
No one, nowhere.

32:23.760 --> 32:26.520
It's just a lunatic fantasy.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.240
Or civilization, as we like to call it.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.960
-Give me your left arm.
-Why?

32:33.040 --> 32:34.640
Because you're going to give blood.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.960
Well, this is a first.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.680
So tell me,
what is the Jonathan Harker Foundation?

33:06.280 --> 33:08.160
I can't seem to penetrate the skin.

33:08.640 --> 33:09.520
No?

33:10.400 --> 33:11.400
Give it to me.

33:15.480 --> 33:16.360
Take this.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.400
Hold this.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.120
Johnny was a fine man.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.800
What has this place got to do with him?

33:47.360 --> 33:49.560
-Oh, you remember Harker, then?
-Mm-hmm.

33:49.640 --> 33:53.160
This foundation was set up by Mina Murray,
his fiancée. Do you remember her?

33:55.720 --> 33:56.800
Barely.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.440
Insipid little thing.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.360
Flavorless, one imagines.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.360
Well, you left her alive.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.400
Go, now!

34:04.480 --> 34:06.560
When her father died,
she inherited his fortune.

34:06.640 --> 34:09.040
And with the cooperation
of Sister Agatha's extended family,

34:09.120 --> 34:11.440
they set up this foundation
in Jonathan's name.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.320
So, you run the family firm?

34:14.120 --> 34:17.360
I've always approved of inherited power.

34:17.440 --> 34:20.360
Democracy is the tyranny
of the uninformed.

34:21.480 --> 34:25.920
Only in blood do we find the truth, Zoe.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.560
Our primary purpose is medical research,

34:36.640 --> 34:39.400
but with the stipulation that
were you ever to be found,

34:39.480 --> 34:42.800
you would be trapped, studied, understood,
and humanely fed.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.440
-You're a unique specimen.
-No.

34:46.720 --> 34:49.960
I'm a 500-year-old warlord.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.280
And...

34:54.520 --> 34:56.600
I know mercenaries when I see them.

34:58.360 --> 34:59.640
Who's funding this place?

35:01.520 --> 35:06.040
Because people who can afford mercenaries
are very rarely interested in medicine.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.480
You're withholding information.
I'm giving you everything.

35:11.560 --> 35:12.680
Blood is lives.

35:12.760 --> 35:16.200
Everything is in the blood, Zoe,
if you know how to read it.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.480
Do you know how to read it?

35:19.040 --> 35:21.120
You couldn't read mine. You choked on it.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.880
I remember the flavor, though.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.160
Um... What is that?

35:27.600 --> 35:31.360
You're fast. You're clever. Driven.

35:31.840 --> 35:32.720
But driven by what?

35:32.800 --> 35:36.400
Agatha was always trying
to save everybody, but you...

35:39.280 --> 35:41.800
You hold yourself apart.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.120
Friendless, loveless,

35:45.200 --> 35:50.080
childless, compromised, corrupt even.

35:53.080 --> 35:53.920
Ah.

35:55.200 --> 35:58.480
Zoe Helsing,
there's a shadow on your heart.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.400
I've sampled its bitter bouquet before,

36:02.480 --> 36:04.880
and these days, I believe...

36:06.880 --> 36:08.280
you call it...

36:09.880 --> 36:10.960
...cancer.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.840
That's why your blood was poison to me.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.160
You're dying.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.440
Doctor, I need to talk to you.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.880
-What is it? Who's this?
-Oh, hi, Frank.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.520
Sorry, yes. Hello. Bit late. Trains.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.000
What're you thinking? Get rid of him.
Throw him out the bloody building.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.280
Dr. Helsing, I think you'd better listen.

36:36.720 --> 36:37.560
Who are you?

36:37.640 --> 36:39.360
I'm sorry. That's rude of me.

36:39.440 --> 36:43.480
Um, this is Frank Renfield.
We've been, um, Skyping.

36:44.520 --> 36:48.480
Hello. Dr. Helsing, isn't it?
I'm sure we can sort all this out.

36:48.560 --> 36:49.400
Skyping?

36:49.840 --> 36:50.960
Ah, yes. Um...

36:51.400 --> 36:53.440
Thanks for this.

36:53.520 --> 36:55.360
You're online?
You're not supposed to be online.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.120
Well, don't you know
how these things work?

36:57.560 --> 36:58.880
Terribly clever.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.440
Who gave him the Wi-Fi password?

37:02.280 --> 37:03.480
Well, it's my name.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.120
Oh, Jesus.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.720
Tell Dr. Helsing who you are.

37:06.800 --> 37:10.600
Right, well, yes.
I'm Count Dracula's lawyer.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.040
-His what?
-His lawyer.

37:12.120 --> 37:12.960
His lawyer?

37:13.520 --> 37:16.640
Sorry. Well, not sorry. But, you know,

37:17.280 --> 37:20.520
I'm afraid it does look like
you're keeping him here against his will,

37:20.600 --> 37:23.160
and whilst my client doesn't want
to make a fuss,

37:23.240 --> 37:25.840
well, that's not really on, is it?

37:27.960 --> 37:32.200
-Since when do you have a lawyer?
-Um... 1896.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.280
Exactly, yes.

37:33.360 --> 37:37.320
We've been representing Count Dracula
since September the 12th, 1896.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.160
Well, Hawkins and Wentworth have.

37:39.240 --> 37:41.520
Wasn't there myself. Not that old.

37:42.080 --> 37:42.920
No offense.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.080
1896?

37:45.400 --> 37:47.040
We purchased some properties for the count

37:47.120 --> 37:48.320
and arranged his resettlement.

37:48.400 --> 37:52.440
Does it bother you that the man
who engaged your firm in 1896

37:52.520 --> 37:54.720
is standing over there
without a single gray hair?

37:54.800 --> 37:56.560
Ah. Thank you.

37:56.640 --> 37:59.840
Oh, it does. Yes, quite a lot.

37:59.920 --> 38:02.960
Really, in fact,
I think it's properly frightening.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.000
Don't you?

38:04.080 --> 38:07.080
But the thing is, you see,
being well over a century old

38:07.160 --> 38:09.400
is not actually against the law.

38:09.480 --> 38:12.520
What's against the law
is you locking him up.

38:13.840 --> 38:16.080
I think you might've forgotten,
Dr. Helsing,

38:17.280 --> 38:18.880
Count Dracula has rights.

38:19.320 --> 38:20.360
Yeah.

38:24.120 --> 38:25.680
He's a bloody vampire!

38:25.760 --> 38:27.960
I feel that's an emotionally loaded term.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.040
It is the correct term.

38:30.120 --> 38:32.760
It's not a legal term.
Has he harmed anyone?

38:32.840 --> 38:34.000
-Yes.
-No.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.440
-Well, on the beach--
-No.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.040
There were rumors of an incident
on the beach a few nights ago,

38:39.120 --> 38:41.480
but there was no trace of anything
the following morning.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.200
And everyone has stopped talking about it.

38:43.280 --> 38:46.280
So, either there's been
some sort of cover-up,

38:46.360 --> 38:49.040
in which case,
the police will certainly be interested,

38:49.120 --> 38:51.280
or there was no incident to cover up
in the first place,

38:51.360 --> 38:53.640
and my client is guilty of nothing.

38:54.120 --> 38:55.920
Which would you prefer?

38:56.840 --> 38:59.400
After all,
why would a medical research facility

38:59.880 --> 39:01.560
have access to... uh...

39:01.640 --> 39:04.320
I don't know, let's say, mercenaries.

39:04.880 --> 39:08.320
I'm not curious for myself,
you understand, but...

39:08.400 --> 39:09.720
...people are such gossips.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.600
Count Dracula has given a deadline
for his release.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.000
Eleven minutes past eight this evening.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.840
Slightly odd timing.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.280
But he has his ways.

39:20.760 --> 39:21.640
It's not odd.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.720
It's not odd at all, Mr. Renfield.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.840
Eleven minutes past eight is sunset.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.360
I'm sending you an e-mail.

40:03.120 --> 40:05.160
<i>"Dear Zoe,</i>

40:06.320 --> 40:09.120
<i>Thank you for being such a courteous host.</i>

40:09.760 --> 40:11.240
<i>It is, however,</i>

40:11.320 --> 40:14.920
<i>the tradition that the courteous host</i>
<i>must speed the parting guest,</i>

40:15.520 --> 40:17.600
<i>and I'm sure you will accord with this.</i>

40:18.840 --> 40:21.760
<i>Also, thank you for your offer of food.</i>

40:21.840 --> 40:24.840
<i>However, it is not my practice</i>
<i>to eat cattle.</i>

40:26.200 --> 40:29.040
<i>In the matter of blood, I'm a connoisseur.</i>

40:29.840 --> 40:34.880
<i>Blood is lives. Blood is testimony.</i>

40:35.760 --> 40:40.680
<i>The testimony of everyone</i>
<i>I've ever destroyed flows in my veins.</i>

40:41.480 --> 40:44.840
<i>I will choose with care</i>
<i>who joins them now.</i>

40:45.920 --> 40:48.760
<i>Ripeness is the first moment of decay.</i>

40:49.320 --> 40:53.320
<i>Sweetness is the promise of corruption.</i>

40:54.120 --> 40:57.560
<i>I shall look for the perfect fruit</i>
<i>of this world.</i>

40:58.840 --> 41:00.680
<i>And I will find it.</i>

41:01.560 --> 41:03.680
<i>Never doubt that.</i>

41:04.760 --> 41:06.640
<i>I will find it.</i>

41:08.120 --> 41:11.800
<i>Blood is everything</i>
<i>you need to know, Zoe,</i>

41:12.600 --> 41:14.520
<i>if you understand how to read it.</i>

41:16.080 --> 41:18.240
<i>Have you worked out how yet?</i>

41:19.680 --> 41:22.200
<i>If you ever hope to match me,</i>

41:22.880 --> 41:24.040
<i>you'll have to."</i>

41:48.360 --> 41:51.600
<i>The Jonathan Harker Foundation,</i>
<i>terribly interesting,</i>

41:52.320 --> 41:55.240
did some tremendous work
during the last two flu outbreaks,

41:55.320 --> 41:58.800
but their funding stream is,
to say the least, opaque.

41:59.240 --> 42:02.120
One might almost say... occult.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.440
<i>Where did you go?</i>

42:15.520 --> 42:18.280
<i>Are you sulking?</i>
<i>Just 'cause I got engaged?</i>

42:21.840 --> 42:23.800
<i>Jack, don't sulk.</i>

42:24.520 --> 42:26.760
Um, Jack's not here at the moment.

42:27.360 --> 42:29.600
-Who shall I say called?
- <i>Oh, sorry.</i>

42:29.680 --> 42:32.240
<i>Tell him it's Lucy. Lucy Westenra.</i>

42:33.520 --> 42:34.360
<i>Who's this?</i>

42:35.560 --> 42:37.840
Hello, Lucy Westenra.

42:38.800 --> 42:40.280
I'm Count Dracula.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.400
<i>Agatha Van Helsing.</i>

43:36.800 --> 43:38.200
<i>You'll be part of me.</i>

43:40.000 --> 43:43.480
You'll travel to the New World
in my veins.

43:43.560 --> 43:45.960
Come, boy, suckle.

44:27.680 --> 44:29.680
-I can't do two more days of this.
-What?

44:29.760 --> 44:32.160
-I feel bloody terrible already.
-Lightweight.

44:32.240 --> 44:33.920
-Stick your head out the window.
-It's the Jägerbombs.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.880
That last one tasted like
furniture polish.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.760
-Where are the crisps?
-I can't get the taste out of my mouth.

44:37.840 --> 44:39.360
Somebody said they were getting crisps.

44:39.800 --> 44:41.120
We only have plain ones.

44:41.200 --> 44:45.000
Plain? Oh, Jesus.
What's good about no flavor?

44:45.080 --> 44:46.920
<i>What was wrong with the physicist?</i>

44:49.720 --> 44:51.240
No flavor.

44:51.320 --> 44:52.760
And the tennis player?

44:52.840 --> 44:54.080
Stringy.

44:54.160 --> 44:57.600
Master, I am trying to provide you
with precisely the skill sets

44:57.680 --> 44:58.800
you're hoping to acquire.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.720
Listen, for 500 years,
I have not had to exercise,

45:01.800 --> 45:03.440
but these days,
everything is done for you,

45:03.520 --> 45:05.840
and everything is being delivered,
even food.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.960
- We nearly there?
- Another 20 minutes.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.120
What?

45:14.880 --> 45:16.840
-I'm just texting.
-I know that face.

45:16.920 --> 45:18.160
-What face?
-Yours.

45:18.840 --> 45:21.040
<i>"Will you be hungry later?"</i>

45:21.120 --> 45:25.080
Master, you came to me with a program,
a plan,

45:25.160 --> 45:27.560
some genuinely fresh initiatives for--

45:27.640 --> 45:31.280
Well, let's call it what it is,
world domination.

45:31.360 --> 45:35.960
May I ask, as your lawyer,
what are you doing with your time?

45:36.040 --> 45:39.240
You can't afford to feed on just anyone.

45:43.080 --> 45:45.760
Oh, dot, dot, dot.
There's a reply coming.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.280
-Give it back.
-Are you not eating with us?

45:47.360 --> 45:49.880
-She's drinking with us.
-Give it here.

45:49.960 --> 45:51.600
Ah... Reply's in.

45:51.680 --> 45:53.080
"Is that an offer?"

45:53.160 --> 45:55.520
Lucy Westenra, you're getting married.

45:55.600 --> 45:57.320
Yeah, final days as a free woman.

45:57.400 --> 45:59.280
-Give it here.
-Uh-uh. How shall I reply?

46:00.520 --> 46:02.680
Yes. Just say yes.

46:02.760 --> 46:05.440
"Miss Westenra is available

46:05.520 --> 46:09.760
for a late dinner."
I'm saying "late." We've got karaoke.

46:10.480 --> 46:13.120
So who's this one, then? D?

46:14.520 --> 46:16.000
Who's D?

46:17.520 --> 46:20.680
How about this one?
Staying locally, double first from Oxford,

46:20.760 --> 46:23.280
martial arts expert, non-drinker.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.560
-Ah!

46:24.640 --> 46:26.880
Sorry. Already have dinner plans.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.800
I am trying, Dark Lord.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.000
I do sometimes wonder

46:32.480 --> 46:34.400
what it is that you actually want.

46:57.680 --> 47:01.040
Uh, what about the Harker Foundation?
Are they still taking an interest?

47:01.120 --> 47:03.080
Hmm, there is some activity.

47:03.160 --> 47:05.960
However, your lady friend
has left their employ.

47:06.040 --> 47:07.680
My lady friend?

47:07.760 --> 47:08.600
Dr. Helsing.

47:10.720 --> 47:13.480
I'm unclear exactly what's happened,

47:13.560 --> 47:18.960
but I'm assuming
she'll take no further interest in you.

47:19.840 --> 47:20.920
Hmm.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.160
What's the time?

47:37.200 --> 47:38.120
Half two.

47:39.840 --> 47:40.720
You know what?

47:42.200 --> 47:45.280
I think there's blood
in my alcohol stream.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.680
Yeah.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.040
-Did you hear what I said?
-I did.

47:49.120 --> 47:51.880
-There's blood--
-In your alcohol stream. It was hilarious.

47:51.960 --> 47:53.840
It's the wrong way around, you see?

47:53.920 --> 47:55.720
Stop, you're killing me.

47:56.520 --> 47:58.040
Are you even drunk?

47:58.520 --> 48:01.000
Were you even drinking properly?

48:01.080 --> 48:03.080
Maybe I'm saving myself.

48:03.160 --> 48:04.120
For dinner?

48:04.200 --> 48:05.080
Mm.

48:05.160 --> 48:06.080
For D?

48:06.680 --> 48:07.560
Don't.

48:08.240 --> 48:10.120
Who's hungry at this time of night?

48:13.280 --> 48:15.600
You sure about all this?

48:15.920 --> 48:16.840
All what?

48:17.840 --> 48:19.280
Marrying Quincey.

48:19.640 --> 48:20.480
I like him.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.040
You're supposed to love him.

48:22.120 --> 48:24.440
Okay, I love him, then.

48:24.520 --> 48:27.760
'Cause he loves you, and Jack loves you.

48:28.440 --> 48:29.800
Everybody loves you.

48:30.080 --> 48:32.480
Yeah. I'm pretty. That happens.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.000
Woo! Listen to her.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.200
Do you know what it's like
when you're pretty?

48:36.280 --> 48:37.440
Yes.

48:37.920 --> 48:39.880
Everybody smiles.

48:40.840 --> 48:44.600
You never see the world without a big,
stupid smile on its face.

48:44.680 --> 48:45.720
Mm.

48:45.800 --> 48:49.040
The thing you don't get...

48:49.120 --> 48:50.240
...marriage...

48:51.240 --> 48:52.960
is for life.

48:54.600 --> 48:56.880
Yeah, but life isn't forever.

49:29.600 --> 49:30.880
Ah!

49:33.320 --> 49:34.520
Tart.

49:35.360 --> 49:36.240
Hungry.

49:37.200 --> 49:38.400
Could've waited.

49:38.480 --> 49:40.480
Need to feed on someone, Lucy.

49:41.440 --> 49:43.400
You don't always give your consent.

49:44.120 --> 49:45.320
I bet this one didn't.

49:45.840 --> 49:46.800
Fast food.

49:49.280 --> 49:50.800
So why does my consent matter?

49:51.200 --> 49:53.000
It doesn't, but it's delicious.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.840
I'm a gourmet, not a glutton.

49:58.160 --> 50:00.160
Why always a graveyard?

50:00.640 --> 50:03.120
I like to spend time with people
my own age.

50:04.440 --> 50:07.320
Yeah, funny guy. Very funny.

50:07.400 --> 50:09.040
Where will you be buried?

50:10.320 --> 50:11.320
Why?

50:11.840 --> 50:13.480
Because I might want to visit.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.440
That's next-level clingy.

50:15.520 --> 50:17.440
-Thank God I'm being cremated.
-No.

50:17.520 --> 50:21.440
Shut up. Everyone here's
just wasted space for this.

50:22.320 --> 50:23.240
Listen to me.

50:24.320 --> 50:25.720
Do not let them burn you.

50:26.360 --> 50:27.320
Why not?

50:27.560 --> 50:28.600
It hurts.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.760
Never heard anyone complain.

50:31.840 --> 50:34.600
Well, I have. I'd say there are...

50:37.160 --> 50:38.720
nine here.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.280
Yes. Nine.

50:43.560 --> 50:46.000
Nine what?

50:46.720 --> 50:47.840
Sufferers.

50:52.520 --> 50:53.400
Come here.

51:04.800 --> 51:05.880
Give me your hand.

51:08.000 --> 51:08.920
What am I doing?

51:09.640 --> 51:10.600
Listening.

51:23.240 --> 51:24.120
What's that?

51:25.040 --> 51:26.280
What does it sound like?

51:31.400 --> 51:33.760
-Knocking.
- Knocking, yes.

51:34.560 --> 51:36.120
On a coffin lid.

51:38.280 --> 51:39.880
From the inside.

51:46.560 --> 51:48.400
Turn on the lights, please.

51:49.320 --> 51:52.360
Someone turn on the light. It's so dark.

51:52.440 --> 51:55.280
<i> </i>I can't find my face.
I can't feel it.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.400
- Help me!

51:58.000 --> 51:59.200
Are they vampires?

52:00.040 --> 52:02.240
Nothing so evolved. They're just undead.

52:02.320 --> 52:07.240
The unfortunate few who remain sentient
as they rot.

52:09.360 --> 52:10.320
Ah.

52:11.640 --> 52:14.240
The children of the night.
What music they make.

52:19.120 --> 52:20.120
Ah!

52:20.800 --> 52:21.800
Please!

52:22.520 --> 52:28.800
Bloofer lady. Bloofer lady. Bloofer lady.

52:29.240 --> 52:30.200
Bloofer?

52:30.880 --> 52:33.160
Beautiful. He means you.

52:34.080 --> 52:35.600
Bloofer lady.

52:38.320 --> 52:39.840
How does he know I'm here?

52:39.920 --> 52:41.640
Because he's looking at you.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.080
Right there.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.160
Bloofer lady.

52:49.840 --> 52:52.520
Bloofer lady play peekaboo.

52:54.840 --> 52:56.320
Peekaboo.

52:57.120 --> 53:00.320
Some of the little ones wriggle their way
to the surface.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.280
I think they can smell the worms.

53:05.360 --> 53:06.680
Can you see me?

53:07.280 --> 53:10.000
No, no, no. No, no!

53:11.440 --> 53:14.520
Don't play with him.
He'll follow you home.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.760
Would he really?

53:18.840 --> 53:22.120
You know, in a very, very long life,

53:23.600 --> 53:26.400
I don't think I've ever met anyone
quite like you.

53:28.760 --> 53:31.360
You really don't care, do you?

53:35.880 --> 53:37.760
The perfect fruit.

53:55.560 --> 53:56.600
Lucy?

53:58.400 --> 53:59.240
Shit.

54:08.880 --> 54:11.680
Dying is the only remaining novelty.

54:12.320 --> 54:15.440
Every other human experience
is cataloged somewhere

54:15.520 --> 54:17.760
in your endless, chattering libraries.

54:18.080 --> 54:19.880
Nothing comes fresh.

54:19.960 --> 54:23.760
Every living instant is shop-soiled
and secondhand,

54:23.840 --> 54:27.760
except that one moment in life
that no one can report back on.

54:28.280 --> 54:30.280
In a world of traveled roads,

54:32.040 --> 54:34.720
death is the last unprinted snow.

54:38.120 --> 54:40.160
You don't have to talk a lot of shit.

54:43.360 --> 54:45.960
You know,
people don't usually say that to me.

54:46.320 --> 54:48.600
Yeah, you kill them before they can.

54:49.440 --> 54:51.200
Basically, you're blocking people.

55:02.920 --> 55:04.760
-Do you love me?
-No.

55:06.160 --> 55:07.640
-Will you ever love me?
-No.

55:08.320 --> 55:11.600
Well, that's one less thing
to worry about.

55:12.640 --> 55:15.440
Aren't you even a little scared of me?

55:16.880 --> 55:18.080
Aren't you afraid of anything?

55:19.560 --> 55:20.600
Even dying?

55:22.040 --> 55:23.160
Everybody dies.

55:26.640 --> 55:28.920
Lucy, you're a very special flavor.

55:36.800 --> 55:37.720
Two minutes.

55:38.520 --> 55:40.200
If you've still got the appetite.

55:40.600 --> 55:42.400
-Three.
-Five.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.480
Special treat.

55:45.080 --> 55:47.320
What do you want to dream about tonight?

55:47.400 --> 55:48.800
Put me somewhere beautiful.

55:50.320 --> 55:51.840
Where no one can see me.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.840
Where I don't have to smile.

56:22.360 --> 56:27.080
Unscrupulous doctor
deployed tanner's knife. Twelve letters.

56:29.600 --> 56:30.480
Ah.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.240
Dracula...

56:36.680 --> 56:37.600
is...

56:41.160 --> 56:42.200
my...

56:43.960 --> 56:44.960
lord.

56:47.280 --> 56:48.280
Lucy?

56:50.440 --> 56:51.520
Lucy?

56:54.800 --> 56:55.720
Lucy.

56:57.760 --> 56:59.840
Luce. What the hell?

57:02.560 --> 57:05.240
<i>Jack, please, you've gotta see her.</i>

57:05.320 --> 57:08.000
<i>She won't see doctors,</i>
<i>but she might see you.</i>

57:25.080 --> 57:26.160
Stop.

57:53.280 --> 57:55.000
<i>Could I speak to Dr. Helsing, please?</i>

58:00.120 --> 58:00.960
No.

58:02.560 --> 58:03.760
No, I didn't know that.

58:30.560 --> 58:31.440
Hello.

58:33.760 --> 58:35.200
Did somebody send you?

58:41.120 --> 58:45.480
Look, sorry, no offense,
but I am really not a believer.

58:47.240 --> 58:48.080
Zoe?

58:52.440 --> 58:53.920
Sorry, I didn't mean to--

58:54.000 --> 58:57.400
Oh, Jack. Hello. Sorry, I was dreaming.

58:57.480 --> 58:58.560
Please come in.

58:59.120 --> 59:00.040
Thanks.

59:00.680 --> 59:02.320
Sorry if I startled you.

59:02.800 --> 59:03.800
No, no, you didn't.

59:04.160 --> 59:05.400
Ugh.

59:05.480 --> 59:07.480
Try again, I'm incredibly bored.

59:09.520 --> 59:12.440
-I didn't bring any grapes or anything.
-I hate grapes.

59:12.520 --> 59:14.040
In that case, you're welcome.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.480
Very kind of you to come
and see your old mentor.

59:25.040 --> 59:26.000
Is it, Jack?

59:27.880 --> 59:28.760
Is it kind?

59:35.960 --> 59:37.360
Oh, Jack.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.560
You're my star pupil.

59:43.040 --> 59:45.960
I only suggested you for the donor program

59:46.040 --> 59:47.840
so you could get some easy money.

59:48.120 --> 59:49.360
Get you through college.

59:52.400 --> 59:55.160
I never thought Dracula
would actually come back.

59:55.240 --> 59:56.200
Nobody did.

59:57.720 --> 59:58.640
So...

1:00:01.400 --> 1:00:02.360
what do you think?

1:00:03.680 --> 1:00:04.880
About Lucy?

1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:07.640
It's possible.

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.040
Could be him.

1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:13.600
-Dracula chooses his victims for a reason.

1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:17.680
Is there anything special about her?

1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:22.880
I love her.

1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:24.800
But she's a perfectly ordinary girl.

1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:26.560
She can't be.

1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:30.120
Because if it is Dracula,

1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:34.680
what keeps him coming back for more?

1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:03.920
Hello?

1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:07.280
Who's down there?

1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:09.760
Is that you?

1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:12.400
Peekaboo.

1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:20.400
Peekaboo.

1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:23.880
Bloofer lady.

1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:30.160
- Peekaboo.
- May I come in?

1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:35.080
Peekaboo.

1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:51.920
Please avert your eyes.

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:56.080
I, um... have to murder a child...

1:01:56.920 --> 1:01:58.960
as we used to say in Vladivostok.

1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:15.480
I'm ill.

1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:18.400
Well, not ill, precisely.

1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:21.160
Look at my face.

1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:26.840
So, so beautiful.

1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:29.400
I'm as white as a sheet.

1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:32.480
As the last unprinted snow.

1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:44.280
Am I dying?

1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:46.440
You're mortal.

1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:48.800
You've been dying
since the day you were born.

1:02:56.560 --> 1:02:58.360
My people have a saying,

1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:03.400
"One should always speed
the parting guest."

1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:26.000
How you feeling, love?

1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:32.120
Just gonna make some tea. Want some?

1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:35.880
I'll bring you a cuppa.

1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:38.880
You stay there.
You need to keep your strength up.

1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:46.880
Help me!

1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:50.120
<i>Help me!</i>

1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:53.280
Help me!

1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:55.920
Help me!

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:57.160
Shh.

1:03:57.840 --> 1:04:00.000
Hush, Lucy, you're mine now.

1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:02.680
You've nothing left to fear.

1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:05.600
You won't be long in your grave.

1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:11.000
<i>Your mind screams aloud,</i>
<i>but for now, your body must be silent.</i>

1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:14.360
In the midst of life, we are in death.

1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:18.360
Of whom may we seek for succor,
but of thee, O Lord,

1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:22.040
who, for our sins, art justly displeased.

1:04:22.120 --> 1:04:28.600
Yet, O Lord God most holy, deliver us not
into the bitter pains of eternal death.

Hello?

1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:23.840
Hello, is someone there?

1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:33.120
Is someone here?

1:06:40.040 --> 1:06:41.520
Did someone open the furnace?

1:06:43.040 --> 1:06:44.800
It's not supposed to be open yet.

1:06:50.600 --> 1:06:51.760
Did you...

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:53.440
put me...

1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:55.880
-Oh, my...
-...in the fire?

1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:08.480
I'll be with you in a moment.

1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:11.840
Where am I?

1:07:12.440 --> 1:07:14.560
That is not the question, Zoe.

1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:17.000
I may call you Zoe, mayn't I?

1:07:17.560 --> 1:07:21.280
The question is,
what are Dracula's limitations?

1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:23.680
So, we know three things:

1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:26.680
he cannot enter an abode
without an invitation,

1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:31.320
he cannot stand in the sunlight,
and he fears, above all things,

1:07:31.400 --> 1:07:32.680
the sight of the cross.

1:07:33.160 --> 1:07:34.480
But you see, we are wrong.

1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:38.160
These three things must be one thing,
much tidier.

1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:41.400
God is always tidy--
Well, according to his own account.

1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:44.800
Oh, do stop hanging your mouth open
like that.

1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:48.040
Dracula drank my blood, and you drank his.

1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:50.120
Blood is lives.

1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:54.760
What's left of mine is in him
and now also in you.

1:07:55.760 --> 1:07:59.520
As he promised, I have traveled
to the New World in his veins.

1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:07.360
There are an awful lot of people
in Dracula's blood,

1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:09.680
but I suppose my DNA syncs with yours.

1:08:09.760 --> 1:08:13.080
Oh. What a useful vocabulary I now have.

1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:16.880
-Who are you?
-It's perfectly obvious who I am.

1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:20.200
-So, what does Dracula fear?
-I don't know.

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:21.640
Or what does he want, then?

1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:23.240
I don't know.

1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:24.360
Yes, you do.

1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:28.480
He returned to feed on Lucy Westenra
time and time again.

1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:32.360
Well, he could feed off anyone in London,
anyone in the world.

1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:36.200
Why return to one perfectly ordinary girl
night after night?

1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:38.960
Who are you?

1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:40.320
Who do I look like?

1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:42.640
Me.

1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:45.760
Correct. Now, think, think, think.

1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:47.720
What does he want and what does he fear?

1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:49.160
I don't know. I don't care.

1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:50.920
It's not my problem anymore.

1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:56.200
I am inside your head.

1:08:57.280 --> 1:08:58.720
I feel your guilt.

1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:01.000
Your foundation,

1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:03.480
it was funded by...

1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:07.640
Oh, I can't see it.
You don't like to think about it, do you?

1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:13.040
Wherever that money came from,

1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:15.400
I did good with it.

1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:16.840
For many years, yes.

1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:20.120
But you also brought Dracula back to life
with it.

1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:23.080
So he's still very much your problem,
and you know that.

1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:26.480
What can I do?

1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:29.120
Poor child.

1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:32.280
As our Lord said that night
in Gethsemane,

1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:35.680
"The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak."

1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:37.560
Tell me who you are.

1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:39.200
I am the spirit...

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.400
and you are the flesh.

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:47.000
The darkness of Dracula shall guide us
to the light.

1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:49.240
I'm dying.

1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:51.040
I'm dead.

1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:55.840
But I am Sister Agatha Van Helsing
of the Saint Mary's Convent, Budapest,

1:09:55.920 --> 1:09:58.520
and neither of us are quite done yet.

1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:30.560
<i>I need you to pick me up</i>
<i>from the hospital.</i>

1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:33.200
<i>I'm... discharging myself.</i>

1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:36.480
Zoe, you're dying.

1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.200
Well, don't take too long then.

1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:08.800
Beautiful.

1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:12.640
Beautiful lady.

1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:18.640
Bloofer lady.

1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:24.200
So, Master, in conclusion,

1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:27.240
I feel we should continue to consider
the Harker Foundation

1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:29.160
<i>an active personal threat.</i>

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.880
Sixty-two, I think.

1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:37.080
Accountant.

1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:41.040
<i>We shall, of course,</i>
<i>continue to monitor their activities</i>

1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:44.880
<i>using agents local to the area,</i>
<i>some discrete hacking,</i>

1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:48.240
and, at your suggestion, uh, bats.

1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:49.640
<i>Can I just--</i>

1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:53.680
You don't look very surprised.

1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:55.120
You don't look very dead.

1:11:55.560 --> 1:11:56.760
I'm getting there.

1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:05.600
Finding you wasn't difficult.

1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:09.400
A man of your breeding and ego
is temperamentally incapable of hiding.

1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:12.360
One just looks for an unnecessarily
tall building,

1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:15.800
multiple exits, and no view of a church.

1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:18.040
Also, your number's listed.

1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:27.440
How kind of you.

1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:30.920
Bringing a bottle to the party.

1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:35.040
Very inferior vintage...

1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:38.560
but the gesture is appreciated.

1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:40.480
- Put him down.
-Why?

1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:41.560
This is England.

1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:44.080
Conversation precedes dinner.

1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:48.360
Quite right, Dr. Helsing.

1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:04.120
You're expecting company?

1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:06.920
Yes.

1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:11.520
-Lucy Westenra.
- Oh, you know her?

1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:14.760
Well, this is Dr. Seward.
It was his phone you stole.

1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:17.280
You might say I introduced you.

1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:19.560
Ah, and now she's dead.

1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:23.080
If you're expecting Lucy to rise

1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:25.600
from the grave this evening,
Count Dracula,

1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:28.160
you might be interested to know
that she was cremated.

1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:33.560
Cremated? But I told her. I warned her.

1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:36.240
And still, she let them put her
in the fire?

1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:38.240
-Apparently.
- No, no. You don't understand.

1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:40.480
She would've been conscious
the whole time.

1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:46.480
Her flesh melting, every cell carbonized,
every particle of her being incinerated.

1:13:50.120 --> 1:13:51.480
Stings a bit, I believe.

1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:55.040
There.

1:13:56.120 --> 1:14:00.200
You see? You have underestimated
the resilience of the vampire.

1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:03.080
-Ah!

1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:05.400
I always liked a lively one.

1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:07.600
Um, Dr. Seward...

1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:11.240
she was your friend, was she?

1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:12.160
Yes.

1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:16.080
Now might be a good time
to reflect that beauty...

1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:19.080
is only skin-deep.

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:25.200
Pray for her, Jack.

1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:27.720
Remember, it is the soul...

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:29.560
not the aspect that one loves.

1:14:33.160 --> 1:14:34.560
Dr. Helsing,

1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:36.960
you don't sound quite yourself.

1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:39.560
Are you all right?

1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:41.720
Perfectly.

1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:56.160
Hello, you.

1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:03.120
Did you have much trouble
finding the place?

1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:06.000
I can always sniff you out, babe.

1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:13.480
Jack.

1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:16.760
Oh, Jack, what are you doing here?

1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:20.720
Oh!

1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:22.920
And who's this?

1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:25.360
Finally, you bring someone.

1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:28.800
Bit pale though,
if you don't mind me saying.

1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:32.200
Did you start without me?

1:15:32.280 --> 1:15:34.480
I'm not on the menu. I'm an old friend.

1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:35.760
We go way back.

1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:40.200
Why are you just standing there, Jack?

1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:45.640
Kiss me.

1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:49.160
Kiss me, Jack.

1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:52.520
Kiss me.

1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:54.480
Lucy, no.

1:15:56.280 --> 1:15:58.800
Come on, Jack. Kiss me like you used to.

1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:04.360
Kiss me.

1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:10.800
Kiss the girl, Dr. Seward.

1:16:11.920 --> 1:16:14.360
Journeys end in lovers meeting.

1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:20.120
What's wrong, Jack?

1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:22.200
You can't look at me now?

1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:25.120
The boy who looks at me all day,
every day, can't you look now?

1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:26.720
What's the matter, Jack?

1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:32.240
Lucy, can't you see yourself?

1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:34.720
Of course I can see myself.

1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:43.200
Bloofer lady.

1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:45.360
Bloofer lady.

1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:50.440
Everyone...
Everyone smiles when you're beautiful.

1:16:55.120 --> 1:16:56.360
Why aren't you smiling, Jack?

1:16:57.440 --> 1:16:59.080
If you're so beautiful, Lucy,

1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:02.320
why don't you take a selfie?

1:17:07.480 --> 1:17:08.840
You smell funny.

1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:09.880
She's dying.

1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:12.880
We wear the bitter bouquet, Lucy.

1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:15.800
The blood of the dying is death
to the vampire.

1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:21.520
You smell of death.

1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:22.560
It's not just me.

1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:52.920
My patient, Dr. Seward.

1:17:55.120 --> 1:17:56.040
My patient.

1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:01.840
Lucy, my love.

1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:05.400
It's a shock. It's a shock.

1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:08.200
But you've done so well.

1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:10.800
-You've done so well.
- Look at me.

1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:15.360
I see you, bloofer lady.

1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:18.520
Will I always be like this?

1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:21.400
Yes. Promise. Always.

1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:22.920
But I was beautiful.

1:18:23.480 --> 1:18:26.800
Beauty's never more than a disguise, Lucy.
You've outgrown it.

1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:29.160
I don't want to! I don't want to!

1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:31.080
Lucy, listen.

1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:33.880
- Shh.

1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:35.920
Listen to me. Listen.

1:18:36.520 --> 1:18:37.480
Listen to me.

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:39.840
Listen!

1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:46.720
You're my finest bride yet.

1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:53.160
In 500 years, you were the only one
who willingly opened up her veins.

1:18:58.440 --> 1:19:00.000
You knew what was happening.

1:19:00.080 --> 1:19:02.160
-No.
-You embraced it.

1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:06.440
You accepted it. Now you can live forever.

1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:08.200
Oh, yeah? Like this?

1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:09.760
Look at me!

1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:13.600
-I don't mind.
-Oh, don't you?

1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:14.560
No.

1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:15.760
Oh, well, I do!

1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:17.840
I mind!

1:19:32.600 --> 1:19:33.520
Lucy.

1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:36.000
Kiss me.

1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:42.000
No, no, no!

1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:51.600
You don't...
You don't want to kiss me...

1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:54.440
like this.

1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:58.280
Lucy Westenra, there has never been
a day I didn't want to kiss you.

1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:02.320
And there never will be.

1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:12.800
Oh, Jack.

1:20:18.040 --> 1:20:19.000
Oh, Jack.

1:20:55.480 --> 1:20:58.560
Do it. Jack, do it.

1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:01.920
For me.

1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:05.040
Do it for me.

1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:51.000
She was my most promising experiment.

1:21:51.720 --> 1:21:56.160
Took me 500 years
to make a bride this good.

1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:00.320
Now look what you've done.

1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:02.200
She was never yours.

1:22:04.080 --> 1:22:04.960
Or mine.

1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:08.360
Or anyone's.

1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:10.040
Well, I suppose she died well.

1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:13.400
That's a rare quality,
you can take it from me.

1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:15.000
Quality or flavor?

1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:18.440
Ah. Flavor. Very particular.

1:22:18.520 --> 1:22:20.520
In my experience...

1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:21.800
unique.

1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:24.240
She almost seemed in love with death.

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:26.520
That's it.

1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:28.240
That is everything.

1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:32.120
And that's why her.

1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:39.160
Jack, you must go.

1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:43.680
I can't leave you.

1:22:44.560 --> 1:22:48.200
I'm about to have a personal conversation
with Count Dracula.

1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:51.600
And I'm certain
he won't want it witnessed.

1:22:52.200 --> 1:22:53.040
Why not?

1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:55.800
Because there's only one thing
in this world that you're truly afraid of,

1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:57.720
and finally, I know what it is.

1:22:58.240 --> 1:22:59.160
Uh, I don't.

1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:01.560
I know you don't.

1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:07.000
Dr. Seward, you may leave.

1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:09.240
-Get out.
-Dr. Helsing--

1:23:09.320 --> 1:23:10.600
- No, Jack.
-I can't--

1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:14.200
If you want to throw your life away
in some act of selfless heroism,

1:23:14.280 --> 1:23:16.360
there will be other opportunities.

1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:30.640
It's going to be a beautiful day.

1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:33.240
Thank you.

1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:43.000
Well, how did it taste?

1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:47.080
How did what taste?

1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:53.480
Dr. Helsing, I think you drank my blood.

1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:31.600
It's 93 million miles away.
It really isn't gonna hurt you.

1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:34.000
I don't understand.

1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:38.120
I have very few breaths left to explain,
so don't interrupt.

1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:43.480
Consider Count Dracula,
who cannot bear to look in a mirror.

1:24:44.840 --> 1:24:46.080
Agatha...

1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:48.640
Dracula, who won't stand revealed
in the sunlight,

1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:51.840
who cannot enter a home
without invitation.

1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:54.440
These aren't curses.

1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:58.000
They are merely habits that become
fetishes that become legends

1:24:58.080 --> 1:24:59.480
that even you believe.

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:01.480
The rules of the beast,

1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:04.520
as we discussed so very long ago.

1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:08.720
But why?

1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:11.000
What are you afraid of?

1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:14.800
You are a warrior
from a long line of warriors.

1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:16.680
Your grandfather died in battle.

1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:19.680
Your father, your brothers, your sons,
their sons.

1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:23.640
All of them fell as heroes
on the battlefield.

1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:25.880
But not you.

1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:28.200
Not Count Dracula.

1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:32.360
The warlord who skulks in the shadows
and steals the lives of others.

1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:33.920
Unwelcome everywhere.

1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:35.960
Who sleeps in a box of dirt,

1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:38.240
yet dreams of a warrior's grave.

1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:41.040
Who suddenly found himself
in thrall of the girl in love

1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:43.240
with the thing he fears the most:

1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:45.000
death.

1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:51.640
And now we know why this works.

1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:53.120
No.

1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:56.720
Because it speaks of the courage
you long to possess.

1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:00.200
The courage it takes to die.

1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:03.000
I call you ashamed.

1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:06.160
Count Dracula is ashamed.

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:09.600
I don't need this anymore.

1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:11.760
I'm dying.

1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:15.400
I am doing the one thing
that you can never do, Dracula.

1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:26.200
You're in pain.

1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:28.440
I'm equal to it.

1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:31.480
You seek to conquer death,

1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:33.400
but you cannot...

1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:36.080
until you face it without fear.

1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:40.880
Goodbye, Count Dracula.

1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:44.040
Shuffle back to your box of dirt.

1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:45.680
The game is over. You lose.

1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:48.680
You will live forever...

1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:50.360
in shame.

1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:46.160
Beautiful.

1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:20.360
Look at her, Agatha.

1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.120
It's beautiful.

1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:56.480
<i>This isn't real.</i>

1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:01.880
<i>This is a dream.</i>

1:29:02.280 --> 1:29:03.840
<i>Of course it is.</i>

1:29:05.840 --> 1:29:07.440
<i>You're drinking my blood.</i>

1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:17.480
<i>But my blood is deadly to you.</i>

1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:18.640
<i>Yes.</i>

1:29:20.120 --> 1:29:21.360
<i>So you'll die.</i>
