WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:02.240
Previously...

00:02.240 --> 00:03.719
We promised
the Galeckis.

00:03.719 --> 00:06.600
Ken's agreed
to adopt a child.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.039
Must've been
the aneurysm.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.600
You didn't
see your baby.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.320
What's her name?

00:11.320 --> 00:14.160
St Eligius will
receive the deed

00:14.160 --> 00:16.040
to an apartment
building.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.280
A building?

00:17.280 --> 00:18.760
Perhaps
resident-housing.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.560
Maybe a shelter
for the homeless.

00:20.560 --> 00:24.120
You'd be terrific,
but that's years
of college.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.440
There must be
another way.

00:26.440 --> 00:30.440
The State won't
certify you.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.440
Everyone treats me
like their maid.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.920
Mop, mop, mop.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.320
Four years,
I'm Mr Clean.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.320
I should
shave my head
and pierce my ear.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.720
You're walking
across my floor.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.600
How else
can I leave?

02:15.600 --> 02:17.040
Try a window.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.480
How very droll.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.360
Mr Knapp
needs help.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.800
So, help him.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.720
I have to study.

02:23.720 --> 02:25.640
Anyway,
that's your job.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.360
Hope he doesn't
have buttosis.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.800
You look terrific.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.480
Barely got it together
to catch the bus.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.240
Car in the shop?

02:35.240 --> 02:38.120
Sold the convertible
to make tuition.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.520
I drive past
your neighbourhood.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.440
I'll take
you anytime.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.560
Great.

02:43.560 --> 02:47.240
Don't forget the Doctor
Of The Year dinner.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.640
Forget our
first real date?

02:49.640 --> 02:52.040
Mrs Slessinger
needs her Keflex.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.960
You write it.
We'll give it.

02:55.960 --> 02:56.320
"Welcome
home, Jeff"?

02:56.320 --> 02:59.680
Aw, the little
general's out
on furlough.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.080
Richard went
to get him.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.920
First time I'll
see him since
military school.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.320
You sent
your son away?

03:08.320 --> 03:11.680
He was uncontrollable.
I had no choice.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.040
He was
already trained
in weapon use.

03:15.040 --> 03:18.080
Marriages, children...
you sure lack caution.

03:18.080 --> 03:21.640
Maybe I should have
been more careful.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.120
You're impulsive,
daring.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.640
You consider
every angle. Smart.

03:25.640 --> 03:29.040
Smart? Then why
did Mr Barfin die?

03:29.040 --> 03:31.840
Even though
her EKG is normal...

03:31.840 --> 03:33.240
You look great.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.640
So do you.
Great shirt.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.040
..final confirmation
should be made

03:38.040 --> 03:40.440
by cardiac
catheterisation.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.200
Chandler, why is
your name here?

03:43.200 --> 03:46.440
I'm an organiser
of tonight's protest.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.520
Protest?

03:47.520 --> 03:49.880
We're trying to
pressure divestment

03:49.880 --> 03:51.800
from South African
holdings.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.800
I see.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.400
I'm encouraging
people to attend this.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.800
What's happening
in South Sfrica

04:07.800 --> 04:09.240
violates human rights-

04:09.240 --> 04:11.640
segregation,
denial of free speech,

04:11.640 --> 04:14.480
a systematic repression
of the popular majority.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.880
I haven't attended
a demonstration

04:16.880 --> 04:18.839
since the Cambodia
incursion.

04:18.839 --> 04:19.800
Incursion?

04:19.800 --> 04:21.680
Don't hear
that any more.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.160
Hattie Mfalele's
speaking.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.080
Who?

04:24.080 --> 04:25.560
South African activist.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.440
She leads Boston's
anti-apartheid group.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.360
Try reading
a newspaper.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.240
You'll find out
something.

04:32.240 --> 04:36.080
Too early
for my visit
to the john.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.000
Chief Gumede
says divestment

04:38.000 --> 04:40.400
is hurting South
African blacks.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.840
Gumede's a pawn.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.640
Mfalele,
Gumede, let's call
the whole thing off.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.120
Don't make jokes.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.560
I always joke.

04:48.560 --> 04:49.840
You're a knothead.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.760
I'm all for change,

04:51.760 --> 04:54.440
but this Cape Town
revolution's a mistake.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.840
We divest,
they fall apart,

04:56.840 --> 04:59.120
and here come
the Russians.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.960
I admire Dr Chandler
for taking a stand.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.760
That's more than
I can say for you.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.760
Wade, you're up.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.920
We've been meeting
for almost three months.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.800
We're here
to comfort each other.

05:17.800 --> 05:21.800
No one has ever touched,
offered a handkerchief, nothing.

05:22.120 --> 05:25.480
You're all wallowing
individually in your grief.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.480
Now since no one seems
capable of sharing sorrow,

05:29.800 --> 05:33.160
Maybe it's time
we shared a laugh.

05:33.160 --> 05:37.160
When's the last time
you had a good chuckle?

05:37.480 --> 05:40.800
Everybody get down
on the floor,

05:40.800 --> 05:44.640
And put your heads
on everybody else's stomach.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.600
Frieda?

05:45.600 --> 05:49.440
Lie down and put
your head right there.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.320
Use my midriff
as a pillow.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.240
That's it. That's it.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.640
A little farther up. OK.

05:56.640 --> 05:57.600
Donna?

05:57.600 --> 06:00.000
Ellen, come on.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.920
OK.

06:01.920 --> 06:05.920
Go ahead, Carrie.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.600
OK. Now I'm going
to say "Ha."

06:09.600 --> 06:13.440
As we go around,
everybody adds
another "Ha."

06:13.440 --> 06:14.840
This is stupid.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.760
No, this is ha-ha.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.240
Ha.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.640
Ha ha.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.640
Ha ha ha.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.280
Ha ha ha ha.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.960
Ha ha ha ha ha.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.440
Ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.840
Ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.720
Ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.680
Ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha.
Ha ha. Ha ha.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.680
(ALL BEGIN TO LAUGH SPONTANEOUSLY)

06:45.040 --> 06:49.040
I've been dreaming about
hell and my son's soul-

06:51.280 --> 06:54.640
that he's tormented
and not at peace,

06:54.640 --> 06:57.040
and I can't help him.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.440
Ever since
Barbara's been away

06:59.440 --> 07:01.840
with her other
grandparents,

07:01.840 --> 07:05.840
I've been afraid for her.

07:06.200 --> 07:10.200
I don't want her to die
without being baptised.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.640
Why don't you live
in the real world?

07:14.640 --> 07:16.600
What do you mean?

07:16.600 --> 07:20.600
At least you have
a grandchild.

07:21.480 --> 07:25.360
When my son
Rocky died...

07:25.360 --> 07:29.360
my family ended.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.560
Excuse me.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.000
Oh, Carrie.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
I'm sorry.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.040
Jeffrey, hello, darling.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.880
I'm so glad to see you.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.360
Hello, Mother.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.240
How's everything
on the home front?

07:52.240 --> 07:55.560
Come on, soldier,
at ease.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.440
You got so tall.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.360
It's the uniform.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.240
I baked
your favourite.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.200
Devil's food cake.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.640
Let's dig in.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.040
I won't eat
that cake.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.960
Because I love it.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.080
I don't understand.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.640
Read Will by G Gordon Liddy.

08:13.640 --> 08:17.400
Desires can be controlled
by denying self-indulgence.

08:17.400 --> 08:21.400
This is going to
be a great day.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.160
# Peanut sittin'
on a railroad track

08:25.160 --> 08:27.680
# His heart
was all a-flutter

08:27.680 --> 08:30.560
# The 5:15
came rushin' by

08:30.560 --> 08:32.480
# Choo choo

08:32.480 --> 08:34.240
# Peanut butter,
peanut butter... #

08:34.240 --> 08:36.120
She can't
stay forever.

08:36.120 --> 08:39.039
Just till
the sepsis
clears up.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.600
Roxanne...

08:41.600 --> 08:43.520
Her infection's
long gone.

08:43.520 --> 08:47.520
The baby has
to be turned over
to child welfare.

08:48.320 --> 08:52.320
And watch her
get swallowed up
by the system?

08:52.640 --> 08:54.560
Someone will
adopt her.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.120
Maybe...

08:57.120 --> 09:01.120
But the chances
of a black baby
finding a home

09:01.880 --> 09:03.640
aren't very good.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.560
I tried
locating family.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.440
All I found
was Deborah's brother.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.800
He didn't care
that his sister died

09:11.800 --> 09:13.720
or left a newborn.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.720
Sleep tight, princess.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.440
In Blue Creek,
if this happened,

09:24.440 --> 09:27.800
any family would
take that baby in.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.160
Boston's a long way
from Blue Creek.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.520
How about dinner
at Davio's?

09:33.520 --> 09:34.960
Apartheid rally,
remember?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.440
Woodfield Medical Center.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.320
I'll meet you there.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.320
I'm going to try
again to locate
Deborah's family.

09:42.640 --> 09:46.640
She would have
wanted me to
help that baby.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.840
The Ettings baby's
not your responsibility.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.840
She would be
if I adopted her.

09:54.640 --> 09:55.640
# Charlie Brown

09:55.640 --> 09:57.240
# Charlie Brown

09:57.240 --> 09:58.480
# He's a clown

09:58.480 --> 10:00.720
# That Charlie Brown

10:00.720 --> 10:02.960
# He's gonna get caught

10:02.960 --> 10:04.720
# Just you wait and see

10:04.720 --> 10:07.240
# Why's everybody
always pickin' on me... #

10:07.240 --> 10:08.520
Luther...

10:08.520 --> 10:12.520
Mr Knapp's
last bathroom trip
was a false alarm.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.440
He smells smoke now.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.840
I'm getting
the meds out.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.240
Terri Valere,
an architect
specialising

10:19.240 --> 10:20.680
in historic
renovations,

10:20.680 --> 10:23.080
is coming
to my office.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.440
We'll discuss
renovating the Taft
apartment house.

10:26.440 --> 10:30.440
I've tried to think
of the best use
for that building.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.440
Low-cost housing
for the residents.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.400
They love the idea.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.800
Let's consider
all the possibilities.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.160
Mrs Valere has
wonderful ideas.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.840
It'd make a terrific
homeless shelter.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.640
There'd be
child care.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.360
Something about Novino
works for me,

10:48.360 --> 10:50.600
maybe it's the socks
and sneakers.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.040
She's so friendly.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.440
Nice round glutes.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.840
Would she date
a resident?

10:55.840 --> 10:57.280
You never know.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.680
How's it going,
Mr Knapp?

10:59.680 --> 11:01.640
No go.
Just gas.

11:01.640 --> 11:05.640
Help me to bed.

11:05.960 --> 11:09.280
I can't get over
how Jeffrey's changed.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.640
He's having
a conversation
I didn't understand,

11:12.640 --> 11:15.040
in the CAT-scan room.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.600
Probably reminiscent
of the sub base.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.760
Get us at 6:00?

11:20.760 --> 11:24.760
No problem,
my little English scone.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.440
Been a long time.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.120
1967.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.320
'68.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.440
December.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.720
January.

11:38.720 --> 11:41.120
Mind filling in
the blanks?

11:41.120 --> 11:44.440
I'd like you to meet
Edgar Eisenberg,

11:44.440 --> 11:48.440
my first husband.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.840
We work together.
Why live together?

11:54.840 --> 11:56.280
It'd be fun.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.680
Like dorm life
at Swarthmore.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.640
I have student loans.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.560
Low rent's my ticket.

12:02.560 --> 12:06.560
1,000 South Africans
have died in recent
racial violence.

12:06.840 --> 12:09.760
Only 18 units,
all two bedrooms.

12:09.760 --> 12:13.080
Get a roomie,
somebody who's
never there.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.560
Hi, guys.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.440
Carol.
Do you snore?

12:16.440 --> 12:18.840
What are we
talking about?

12:18.840 --> 12:20.800
Auschlander House.
Resident co-op.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.680
Med students
aren't invited.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.520
Feels great out.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.360
Then leave it out.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.760
Sorry.
That was crude.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.200
No problem.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.080
Really? How about
a date then?

12:33.080 --> 12:34.200
No.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.120
Hear anything
about Boomer?

12:36.120 --> 12:38.040
I called
his folks.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.480
He wouldn't
speak.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.920
Ladies and sunbathers.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.320
When's the rally?

12:42.320 --> 12:44.720
7 o'clock. Will everybody
be there?

12:44.720 --> 12:46.680
I've got
an autopsy.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.120
Count me in.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.000
You're coming
to hear Mfalele speak?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.880
The hospital
shouldn't profit
from oppression.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.800
What's
the punch line?

12:55.800 --> 12:58.680
I feel
I should be there.

12:58.680 --> 13:02.480
You don't have laundry
to do until tomorrow?

13:02.480 --> 13:03.920
That's not funny.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.760
True, but not funny.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.200
Looking for me?

13:09.200 --> 13:11.960
He's sure
he's got to go.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.840
Mr K-napp?

13:13.840 --> 13:16.360
Tell him to try.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.640
Boot one
for the gipper.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.560
Have you
seen Jeffrey?

13:20.560 --> 13:23.440
He's discussing m.A.S.H.
Units with Craig.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.200
Jeff's observing
in OR.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.000
Hold down the fort.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.080
Jeff?

13:28.080 --> 13:30.960
My youngest.
By my fourth husband.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.960
I just stopped by
to ask about
our new son-in-law.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.600
I can't
tell you much.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.440
I've had postcards
and one candygram
from Zurich,

13:42.440 --> 13:45.240
But Marcy and Claus
sound terrific.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.760
I received no
wedding invitation.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.640
I found out
Marcy was married
from Julie.

13:51.640 --> 13:52.760
Julie?

13:52.760 --> 13:54.840
Third eldest,
second husband.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.160
Alan Silverman,
my divorce attorney.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.560
No wonder
he wanted me

13:59.560 --> 14:03.080
to give you
the house.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.480
How do you
like Tampa?

14:05.480 --> 14:09.480
Spend a lot of time
driving around
the country,

14:09.760 --> 14:11.200
selling hats.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.640
Clarendon's
your fifth?

14:12.640 --> 14:14.080
We live together.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.960
Guess you could
call him four and a half.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.360
Look more like a
seven and threequarters to me.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.360
Just a little
hat humour.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.680
Would you have dinner
with us tonight?

14:27.680 --> 14:30.880
I can't,
but let's have
a nightcap.

14:30.880 --> 14:34.880
Great!
I'll call you
at the hotel.

14:43.760 --> 14:47.760
You know
I still love you.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.560
Olkewicz, you're
the hotshot
social worker.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.440
We had a deal.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.360
It's been a month.

14:58.360 --> 15:02.360
The Ettings child
is healthy enough
to leave.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.960
I want her to stay.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.160
She has no parents
or legal guardian.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.920
She's a ward
of the State.

15:10.920 --> 15:14.200
She's starting life
on the short side.

15:14.200 --> 15:18.200
She and her mother
planned to make
a better life.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.360
Foster homes don't
serve gruel every day.

15:22.360 --> 15:26.320
She'll be placed
with a loving family.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.960
What if she
was privately adopted?

15:29.960 --> 15:31.160
Any ideas?

15:31.160 --> 15:32.320
Me.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.640
Is that best
for her?

15:34.640 --> 15:36.520
Something must be done.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.240
Her mother knew zip
about pregnancy.

15:39.240 --> 15:43.240
I had to convince her
the baby lived inside her.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.640
She trusted me.

15:45.640 --> 15:49.640
I know you care,
but she needs
constant attention.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.960
There are plenty
of good single mothers.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.920
Take the night
to think about it.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.320
If you're serious,
we'll talk tomorrow

16:02.320 --> 16:06.320
before Child Welfare
comes to pick
the baby up.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.560
We'd drill
into these bricks

16:20.560 --> 16:22.440
and insert
steel rods.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.320
You'll need support
for these floors.

16:25.320 --> 16:28.680
The windows and casements
must be replaced.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.600
With energy-saving
devices,

16:30.600 --> 16:33.480
this building
could be
fuel-efficient.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.400
Considering
the structure's shape,

16:35.400 --> 16:37.280
that's not a worry.

16:37.280 --> 16:41.080
So far, resurrecting
this building
sounds unreasonable.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.000
You've got
a wonderful old building

16:44.000 --> 16:46.440
designed in 1857
by Gordon Wye.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.320
There were only 15
in Boston.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.760
Three remain standing.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.160
What other construction
is indicated?

16:53.160 --> 16:55.040
We'll lower
the ceilings,

16:55.040 --> 16:57.440
rewire to code,
and replumb.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.960
Any estimates?

16:58.960 --> 17:02.520
You'll get a break
for historic renovation.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.040
Half a million.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.400
Assuming we want
to proceed,

17:06.400 --> 17:08.319
when could
you start?

17:08.319 --> 17:11.200
We'll do
the most essential first.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.640
What's that?

17:12.640 --> 17:16.640
Making sure the building
doesn't collapse.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.920
Carol, hi.

17:21.920 --> 17:25.280
I'm just out
of Harvard Med,
myself.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.600
If you need
pointers,
I can help,

17:28.600 --> 17:30.040
maybe over dinner.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.960
Thanks, but I
got to pass.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.040
Hi.

17:34.040 --> 17:38.040
In case you're interested,
Mr Knapp is O for 4.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.880
What are you doing?

17:41.880 --> 17:43.360
White-glove inspection.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.240
I hope you pass.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.560
Would you like
the boxing-glove
inspection?

17:48.560 --> 17:51.240
You got rabies
or something?

17:51.240 --> 17:52.760
Personal problems.

17:52.760 --> 17:56.760
Can't have a bad day here
without a college degree.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.960
I'm only good
for cleaning this place.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.760
You're not even
good at that.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.040
Hey!

18:05.040 --> 18:07.760
Come here.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.040
Where's your mom?

18:09.040 --> 18:10.080
Upstairs.

18:10.080 --> 18:14.080
Good.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.400
Hey!

18:16.400 --> 18:19.320
Don't you ever
do that again.

18:19.320 --> 18:23.320
Yes, sir.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.560
# Hey, Sally's livin'

18:28.560 --> 18:30.000
# How's she livin'

18:30.000 --> 18:31.080
# She's livin'
in the country

18:31.080 --> 18:32.200
# Gonna move to town

18:32.200 --> 18:33.480
# She gonna
shake those hips

18:33.480 --> 18:34.920
# Till the sun go down

18:34.920 --> 18:36.200
# She never went
to college

18:36.200 --> 18:37.600
# She never went
to school

18:37.600 --> 18:38.760
# But when she got back

18:38.760 --> 18:40.000
# She was
a educated fool

18:40.000 --> 18:41.440
# To the front
to the back

18:41.440 --> 18:45.440
# To the side side side

18:47.560 --> 18:51.560
# Dona nobis pacem

18:54.680 --> 18:58.680
# Dona nobis pacem. #

18:59.560 --> 19:03.560
Sweetness.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.920
Send a message
of hope

19:06.920 --> 19:09.960
to the people
of South Africa.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.400
We must persuade
Woodfield Medical Center,

19:13.400 --> 19:16.960
this institution
of mercy,

19:16.960 --> 19:18.800
to be merciful.

19:18.800 --> 19:22.160
You seen Roxanne?

19:22.160 --> 19:24.080
Where could she be?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.960
Pay attention
to the young lady.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.880
You're really
into this.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.080
I've buried my head
in the sand.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.760
Time to
stretch my hands
across the water.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.960
Didn't know
you had it in you.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.720
Reminds me
of Berkeley -

19:39.720 --> 19:41.160
Free Speech
Movement,

19:41.160 --> 19:43.080
riots in
People's Park.

19:43.080 --> 19:46.320
I subscribed
to the Black Panther
newsletter.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.680
See those expensive
European cars?

19:48.680 --> 19:52.040
They belong
to the board of trustees

19:52.040 --> 19:54.920
who are meeting now
to discuss

19:54.920 --> 19:56.880
the hospital's
investment portfolio.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.720
If they can be intractable,
so can we.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.560
I ask you
to join me

20:03.560 --> 20:06.920
in preventing them
from leaving the grounds

20:06.920 --> 20:09.320
until they reverse
their position

20:09.320 --> 20:13.320
and agree to divest!

20:17.280 --> 20:18.720
End apartheid now!

20:18.720 --> 20:20.640
Where are you going?

20:20.640 --> 20:23.520
Do you think
apartheid is wrong?

20:23.520 --> 20:25.440
Showing support's
one thing.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.200
Breaking
the law's another.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.920
You're with us
or against us.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.840
I've got
surgery tomorrow.

20:31.840 --> 20:35.840
Put your butt
where your mouth is.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.760
I cleared everything
with Reverend Jamison.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.640
The baptism
is tomorrow.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.560
When the Galeckis
arrive with Barbara.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.960
We can all be together.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.960
That's fine,
except I'm not going
into that church.

21:01.240 --> 21:05.080
Then we'll have it
in the hospital chapel.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.560
You don't understand.

21:06.560 --> 21:10.560
I don't give a holy heck
if Barbara's baptised.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.240
Well, it's about time.

21:13.240 --> 21:17.240
I ordered the sink-a-dink
for Barbara three weeks ago.

21:17.560 --> 21:21.360
Your baptismal gown
must be in the attic.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.320
Let me be clear.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.360
I don't want
Barbara baptised.

21:25.360 --> 21:29.040
Why?

21:29.040 --> 21:32.920
All my life,
I've been a good boy.

21:32.920 --> 21:36.920
I believed God would
protect me and my family.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.120
Well, he reneged
on his bargain,

21:40.120 --> 21:42.600
and I'll never
forgive him.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.360
I don't care
what you say.

21:45.360 --> 21:49.360
Dr Weiss agrees
I have every right
to do this.

21:50.640 --> 21:54.640
The ceremony
will take place
without you.

22:04.560 --> 22:08.560
What the hell
is this anyway?

22:14.160 --> 22:16.560
Federal mediator,
huh?

22:16.560 --> 22:17.960
Were you involved

22:17.960 --> 22:21.800
in the United
Brotherhood of Hat
Blockers' strike?

22:21.800 --> 22:23.400
Settled it.

22:23.400 --> 22:27.400
Must be a feather
in your cap.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.360
Thank you for
looking after Marcy.

22:32.360 --> 22:33.760
A terrific girl.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.880
I couldn't replace
her father.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.560
Many men have tried.

22:39.560 --> 22:43.560
I'm going to
the little boys' room.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.520
Helen...

22:54.520 --> 22:58.520
You're more beautiful
than when we met.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.280
I'll never
forget that day.

23:01.280 --> 23:05.280
We were so young.

23:05.440 --> 23:08.800
Walking through
St John's Wood...

23:08.800 --> 23:12.800
Watching the sun
rise at Stonehenge...

23:13.600 --> 23:16.960
Making love
at Beachy Head...

23:16.960 --> 23:20.960
A man and a woman.

23:23.680 --> 23:27.680
(HUMS THEME TUNE:
"A Man And A Woman")

23:44.760 --> 23:48.440
Edgar...

23:48.440 --> 23:50.360
Don't.

23:50.360 --> 23:54.360
(HUMS)

23:59.640 --> 24:02.520
In the name
of the Commonwealth

24:02.520 --> 24:03.960
Of Massachusetts,

24:03.960 --> 24:05.840
you're ordered
to disperse.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.240
You're conducting
an unlawful assembly.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.160
Disperse or be arrested.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.600
Nobody move!

24:11.600 --> 24:13.120
Nobody move!

24:13.120 --> 24:17.120
All right, move in.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.200
You can't do that.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.200
Bill!

24:23.200 --> 24:24.160
Bill!

24:24.160 --> 24:26.160
Bill!

24:26.160 --> 24:30.160
Aah!

24:32.560 --> 24:33.840
         All right, Weiss.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.120
Whose confetti
do you think
you're shredding?

24:37.120 --> 24:38.600
Hello, Mark.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.280
Have a seat.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.640
You'd like that.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.560
First I sit down,

24:43.560 --> 24:45.040
then lie down.

24:45.040 --> 24:48.360
My psyche
gets strewn
like dirty linen.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.760
Besides,
this couch needs
reupholstering.

24:50.760 --> 24:53.040
What exactly
is your problem?

24:53.040 --> 24:56.080
Listen, I'm not
here about me.

24:56.080 --> 24:57.480
Uh...Ellen.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.840
I sent her here
in good faith.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.720
You've put ideas
in her head,

25:03.720 --> 25:05.640
like redecorating
my office,

25:05.640 --> 25:07.520
a plaque for Steven,

25:07.520 --> 25:09.040
Barbara's baptism!

25:09.040 --> 25:12.840
Ellen is making
wonderful progress
confronting her grief

25:12.840 --> 25:15.680
and moving on
with her life.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.840
You should try
doing the same.

25:18.840 --> 25:21.920
Oh, boy.
Psychiatrists are
really something.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.840
Always pinning
the tail

25:23.840 --> 25:25.800
on someone
else's donkey.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.120
Next you'll say
I wasn't properly
toilet trained.

25:29.120 --> 25:33.120
I can wring it out
with the best
of them.

25:33.920 --> 25:37.920
Stay away from
me and my wife.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.440
And this...

25:44.440 --> 25:46.400
should be hung...

25:46.400 --> 25:50.400
like so.

25:51.920 --> 25:55.640
Haven't been in jail
since I met Roberta.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.440
Mace
is powerful stuff.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.800
I thought you
were used to this.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.240
Not me, personally.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.080
I never stood up
for anything.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.560
Always
chickened out.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.880
I watched the news
in the sixties.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.840
Billy clubs
scared me.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.200
I've always
felt guilty, too.

26:14.200 --> 26:18.200
Last night, I caught
the spirit finally.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.400
Take care.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.360
Lunch?

26:22.360 --> 26:24.240
No. Enough is enough.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.200
Prunes and Tabasco sauce.

26:26.200 --> 26:30.200
I'm unclogging Mr Knapp.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.920
Hi, sweetie.
You're too close.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.840
Mom! I mean, Mother.

26:34.840 --> 26:38.200
Firing Line's
not on yet.

26:38.200 --> 26:42.040
You want to spend
the last day home

26:42.040 --> 26:43.440
in the hospital?

26:43.440 --> 26:46.800
Yeah. This is where
the action is.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.720
Tell me about school.

26:48.720 --> 26:52.560
I was a sad sack
when I arrived.

26:52.560 --> 26:56.400
I was a useless
piece of flesh.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.280
Jeffrey, you
are a wonderful boy.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.440
A little abusive
sometimes...

27:01.440 --> 27:03.840
But now
I'm a leader.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.000
Do you enjoy that?

27:06.000 --> 27:07.120
Yes!

27:07.120 --> 27:10.560
Stevie Sherwin's
always asking about you.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.760
He's a woman.

27:12.760 --> 27:16.560
He and the other kids
finished that treehouse.

27:16.560 --> 27:19.440
The oak tree
by the creek?

27:19.440 --> 27:22.280
I started that.

27:22.280 --> 27:25.160
I'm glad you're home
with me.

27:25.160 --> 27:27.560
Home's for mothers
and babies.

27:27.560 --> 27:31.400
When we have
field manoeuvres,
could you come?

27:31.400 --> 27:32.840
Yes, of course.

27:32.840 --> 27:35.080
Time for
Mr Langston's Digoxin.

27:35.080 --> 27:39.080
OK.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.640
Sorry about Jeff.

27:49.640 --> 27:52.040
I liked him better
before.

27:52.040 --> 27:56.040
Me, too.

28:02.560 --> 28:06.360
You were to assist me
on Danton's bypass.

28:06.360 --> 28:07.640
I was gassed.

28:07.640 --> 28:08.880
Hangover?

28:08.880 --> 28:10.360
The apartheid rally.

28:10.360 --> 28:14.200
I was maced and
slept in the hoosegow.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.640
What a moron.

28:15.640 --> 28:18.040
I thought
you'd be proud.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.440
Your politics
aren't my concern.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.840
I'm not well.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.200
When your credo
hinders work,

28:24.200 --> 28:27.040
I'll be in your
rear-view mirror.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.960
Now, get to work.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.440
The mace.

28:30.440 --> 28:31.840
Oh, boy.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.920
&lt; (VOMITS)

28:32.920 --> 28:36.040
Ehrlich!

28:36.040 --> 28:39.840
Will this affect
my third year
status, sir?

28:39.840 --> 28:41.240
Count on it.

28:41.240 --> 28:45.240
Look at this.

28:45.720 --> 28:48.640
Hi.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.880
Hope you slept
better than me.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.400
Where were you?

28:52.400 --> 28:53.560
Jail.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.840
Inciting a riot.

28:54.840 --> 28:58.000
I could have
bailed you out.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
I didn't need that.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.400
Where were you?

29:01.400 --> 29:03.520
Here with
Deborah's baby.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.000
I'm sure she
appreciated that.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.880
I needed time
to decide something,

29:08.880 --> 29:11.360
And I've
got an answer.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.840
I bet.

29:12.840 --> 29:14.280
You're mad.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.880
I'm not mad.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.120
I was helping
a child.

29:18.120 --> 29:20.520
People are
fighting for blacks.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.120
That should
matter to you.

29:23.120 --> 29:26.080
Yes, but babies
come before politics.

29:26.080 --> 29:29.040
Somebody fought
to desegregate ole Miss

29:29.040 --> 29:31.920
so you could
become a doctor.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.320
Your responsibility -

29:33.320 --> 29:35.240
Are you my conscience?

29:35.240 --> 29:39.240
Suffering in Africa's
more important than
what's happening here?

29:40.520 --> 29:44.520
I got things to do.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.000
I need to hide.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.400
From what?

29:52.400 --> 29:53.560
Men.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.000
Right place.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.400
Jackie,
what made you sure

29:57.400 --> 30:00.760
you wanted to get
involved with Robert?

30:00.760 --> 30:02.200
His red Corvette,

30:02.200 --> 30:03.600
high-school
sweethearts,

30:03.600 --> 30:05.080
my first love...

30:05.080 --> 30:06.960
Like Edgar and me.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.880
He drove a Nash.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.800
Love because
of cars.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.680
Where we went,
what we did.

30:13.680 --> 30:17.040
The movie,
A Man And A Woman.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.920
Anyone who beats
me arm wrestling.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.840
God, it's
gross today.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.240
Regarding romance,
I'm totally confused.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.320
That's love.

30:26.320 --> 30:30.160
You never get over
your first great love.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.560
Seeing Edgar
rekindled the flames,

30:32.560 --> 30:35.440
and he knew
the right buttons.

30:35.440 --> 30:38.320
Sounds like
a Patsy Cline song.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.640
Practically every man
here has hit on me -

30:41.640 --> 30:43.080
strangers in halls,

30:43.080 --> 30:45.480
staff members,
residents, even Elliot.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.880
It felt wonderful
seeing Edgar.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.720
There must have been
reasons for leaving him.

30:51.720 --> 30:55.720
Why can't I remember
any of them now?

30:57.480 --> 30:58.920
Strict Italian family.

30:58.920 --> 31:01.800
After puberty,
an all-girl's school.

31:01.800 --> 31:04.680
Always wanted
to be with boys,

31:04.680 --> 31:07.560
but didn't know
what to do.

31:07.560 --> 31:10.440
Nobody can blame me
for caution.

31:10.440 --> 31:11.880
Borrow your brush?

31:11.880 --> 31:15.880
I hate my hair.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.800
We're meeting
to discuss Taft House.

31:20.800 --> 31:24.800
I think Mrs Valere's
renovation plan's
awful damned expensive.

31:25.120 --> 31:29.000
That a large filling
defect in the liver?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.840
I think several.
That's the largest.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.800
A cyst or tumour.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.800
You're right.
Your eyes are better.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.800
I hope you'll
come support me.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.640
Nope, afraid I can't.

31:42.640 --> 31:45.000
I backed your
outreach proposals.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Because they're
good programmes

31:47.000 --> 31:48.880
or we're
good friends?

31:48.880 --> 31:50.120
Both.

31:50.120 --> 31:54.120
I think ¤500,000
is too much for
bricks and mortar.

31:54.840 --> 31:57.760
There are better
ways to help.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.640
Your shelter
for the homeless.

31:59.640 --> 32:03.640
No, at these costs,
that's out of the question.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.880
No. OK...

32:05.880 --> 32:09.240
Filling defect would
follow polycystic
kidney disease.

32:09.240 --> 32:11.200
I'll get
an ultrasound.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.040
If you're not
on my side,

32:14.040 --> 32:16.240
stay out of my way.

32:16.240 --> 32:20.240
Explain something.
Why are you so
bent on this project?

32:20.880 --> 32:24.360
Donald, we've been
friends for 31 years.

32:24.360 --> 32:28.360
I shouldn't have to
explain myself to you.

32:38.520 --> 32:42.360
Your prune and Tabasco
cocktail did the trick.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.240
Bowel function's
finally returned.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.400
Figured.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.720
In his bed.

32:46.720 --> 32:50.000
I helped him to
the bathroom five times -

32:50.000 --> 32:51.600
Lower your voice!

32:51.600 --> 32:54.080
It's humiliating
for Mr Knapp.

32:54.080 --> 32:58.000
I'm tired of
being the human
pooper-scooper.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.680
While we're
debating your duties,

33:00.680 --> 33:04.680
Mr Knapp's
lying in his.

33:08.080 --> 33:11.400
When we learned
we couldn't have children,

33:11.400 --> 33:12.880
we panicked.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.280
Yeah.
I watched you argue.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.200
How are you now?

33:17.200 --> 33:19.600
Fine,
but adopting a baby

33:19.600 --> 33:22.000
isn't any easier
than making one.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.640
We waited one month
for an agency appointment.

33:25.640 --> 33:29.000
We sent inquiries
to out-of-state doctors

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
who all said, "Few infants
are available. Be patient."

33:33.160 --> 33:34.600
Hi, sweetheart.

33:34.600 --> 33:38.280
It's a bad time
for a fire drill.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.200
It's profit-taking day.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.640
Put this on.

33:41.640 --> 33:43.560
I like the beard,

33:43.560 --> 33:46.440
but I don't like
kissing fuzzies.

33:46.440 --> 33:47.880
What's going on?

33:47.880 --> 33:51.880
Come here.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.280
Hey, Spike.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.680
OK, Dr Turner,

33:59.680 --> 34:02.560
why this tour
through fantasy land?

34:02.560 --> 34:05.520
The mother died
after giving birth.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.360
I want this child

34:07.360 --> 34:11.360
to be with people
who'll love her.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.280
See how she feels,

34:13.280 --> 34:15.679
and if you like,

34:15.679 --> 34:19.679
she's yours.

34:42.679 --> 34:43.920
Trying to drop a couple
for the chickie?

34:43.920 --> 34:46.600
What?
Carol Novino.

34:46.600 --> 34:49.320
Helen says you chased her
up the stairs.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.639
I'm just taking
an  afternoon schvitz.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.639
You need cold water.

34:54.639 --> 34:58.320
About my yelling at you
at the meeting...

34:58.320 --> 35:01.520
Don't worry about it.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.920
Thanks.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.760
Ellen invited me
to Barbara's baptism.

35:06.760 --> 35:10.120
Well, she's trying
to fill the house.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.040
I think it's nice.

35:12.040 --> 35:14.920
You? The man
who views religion

35:14.920 --> 35:17.800
as a creation
of Hallmark Cards?

35:17.800 --> 35:19.240
Yeah, it's true.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.920
My ties to an
organised church
aren't strong,

35:22.920 --> 35:25.320
but still
I have faith.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.760
In what?

35:26.760 --> 35:28.360
A higher power,

35:28.360 --> 35:29.800
a greater good,

35:29.800 --> 35:31.080
something.

35:31.080 --> 35:35.080
I don't want my granddaughter
spoon-fed preachy pabulum.

35:35.080 --> 35:38.760
It sets her up
for the big let-down.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.600
But kids need some
guidance, morality,

35:41.600 --> 35:45.440
till they can make up
their own minds.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.840
To get through
life's pains,

35:47.840 --> 35:50.760
we need something
to believe in.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.160
Even so,

35:52.160 --> 35:56.000
why should she go through
a useless ritual?

35:56.000 --> 35:57.440
What's a baptism,

35:57.440 --> 35:59.360
a Bar Mitzvah,
a wedding?

35:59.360 --> 36:02.760
It just signifies
the beginning,
doesn't it?

36:02.760 --> 36:06.760
Speaking of which,
I'm finished.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.360
I don't know.

36:08.360 --> 36:11.520
You still looking
for a reason?

36:11.520 --> 36:12.960
Well, yeah.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.960
Do it for Ellen.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.760
Nice. Reminds me
of our first flat.

36:29.760 --> 36:33.120
It's here or the morgue
for privacy.

36:33.120 --> 36:36.320
Fine with me.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.640
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.120
Me, too.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.960
Seeing you again
brought back memories.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.680
Making love
punting on the Thames?

36:46.680 --> 36:48.120
I enjoyed that.

36:48.120 --> 36:52.120
Keep your hands off the light
switch...and me.

36:52.400 --> 36:56.400
And just listen.

36:57.200 --> 37:01.080
Last night, I imagined
the last 20 years

37:01.080 --> 37:03.080
if we hadn't divorced.

37:03.080 --> 37:05.360
Our separation
was a mistake.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.800
When we married,

37:06.800 --> 37:09.600
you were a perfectly
capable man,

37:09.600 --> 37:12.240
but you demanded
all my attention,

37:12.240 --> 37:13.480
all my energy.

37:13.480 --> 37:16.400
I married a person
with direction,

37:16.400 --> 37:18.280
somebody
I could follow.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.720
You still can.

37:19.720 --> 37:23.080
No! I've spent my life
following men.

37:23.080 --> 37:27.080
It's time to stick
with the choice I make.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.400
So you're staying
with Dick.

37:29.400 --> 37:30.840
I call him Richard.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.200
He looks like -

37:32.200 --> 37:34.480
Edgar!

37:34.480 --> 37:38.480
In some ways,
I'll always love you...

37:40.440 --> 37:42.400
but in more ways,

37:42.400 --> 37:46.400
I'll always
hate your guts.

37:56.800 --> 38:00.480
Don't let the big wheels
catch you dawdling.

38:00.480 --> 38:03.360
What will they do,
fire me?

38:03.360 --> 38:06.440
Four years of being
poked by needles,

38:06.440 --> 38:08.400
washing the x-ray room

38:08.400 --> 38:12.000
cos some guy couldn't
get to the bathroom

38:12.000 --> 38:13.920
after a barium enema.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.360
I come last.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.720
I push the broom
behind the parade.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.640
Be a paramedic
full time.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.560
I don't want to.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.000
So quit.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.880
What will I do?

38:25.880 --> 38:28.600
This job's better
than not knowing.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.040
Then don't quit.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.960
You can say that.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.680
You're who
you want to be.

38:34.680 --> 38:38.680
I learned I can
make a difference.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.720
Is Jeffrey packed?

38:41.720 --> 38:43.640
Waiting in the car.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.080
Edgar's gone.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.520
Yeah, I know.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.440
He gave me this.

38:48.440 --> 38:49.880
He seemed nice.

38:49.880 --> 38:52.760
Oh, yeah, he's...

38:52.760 --> 38:54.200
Here you go.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.600
I got her.
Hello, sweetheart.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.280
I remembered
why I left him.

38:59.280 --> 39:02.480
I couldn't go out
with the girls,

39:02.480 --> 39:03.920
but Edgar could.

39:03.920 --> 39:07.280
You and the kids
are important now.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.600
I really have
a family.

39:09.600 --> 39:13.600
I want
to keep that.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.680
Request permission
to speak.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.720
If I'm not back
at 2200 hours,

39:20.720 --> 39:23.800
I'll clean latrines
with my toothbrush.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.680
I'll start the car.

39:25.680 --> 39:29.200
Thanks for letting me
watch you in OR.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.200
You're a good boy.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.880
See you
around midnight.

39:35.880 --> 39:38.800
I'll have Julie
pick me up.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.400
Jeffrey...

39:41.400 --> 39:42.960
I love you.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.200
Mom?

39:44.200 --> 39:45.800
What, darling?

39:45.800 --> 39:49.800
Nothing.

39:56.200 --> 40:00.200
BRAKES SCREECH

40:00.840 --> 40:03.120
Can I come back,
please?

40:03.120 --> 40:04.920
I'll be so good.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.920
Let me come back.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.960
Yes. I'd like that
very much.

40:09.960 --> 40:13.960
Later, Mom.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.800
We'll stop
for ice cream.

40:17.800 --> 40:20.640
I want day-old
devil's food cake.

40:20.640 --> 40:24.640
Hit it, Fender.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.240
Hi, Helen.

40:30.240 --> 40:33.320
Roxanne,
wait a second.

40:33.320 --> 40:37.320
Uh...

40:38.560 --> 40:41.760
Look, um...

40:41.760 --> 40:44.160
Before you left
for Mississippi,

40:44.160 --> 40:47.360
you said my education
hadn't taught me

40:47.360 --> 40:49.280
how fragile people are.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.160
I was angry.
You hurt me.

40:52.160 --> 40:55.520
I've been hurt
a lot lately, too.

40:55.520 --> 40:59.520
At the Crisis
Intervention Center...

41:00.320 --> 41:02.200
I couldn't do anything.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.960
This little girl
called for help.

41:04.960 --> 41:07.880
She shot herself
while we talked,

41:07.880 --> 41:09.840
telling me her problems.

41:09.840 --> 41:13.000
I don't think
I can take suffering

41:13.000 --> 41:14.400
up close any more.

41:14.400 --> 41:18.000
Maybe I'm better
with far-off issues.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.760
You care about
helping the world.

41:20.760 --> 41:23.960
Not enough people do.

41:23.960 --> 41:27.800
Growing up in the city,
you saw so much.

41:27.800 --> 41:30.120
You got news
from television.

41:30.120 --> 41:33.400
I got mine
over a back fence

41:33.400 --> 41:35.800
from people,
one on one.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.880
I know that best,

41:37.880 --> 41:39.320
not issues.

41:39.320 --> 41:42.840
That's why we'd be
a good team.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.800
We'd balance
each other.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.800
First, we have to learn
to get along.

41:52.640 --> 41:56.640
Race you
to the parking lot.

41:58.480 --> 41:59.920
Hello, everybody.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.840
Here's
my little girl.

42:01.840 --> 42:03.280
There we go.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.720
Hello, darling.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.640
Where are
the Galeckis?

42:06.640 --> 42:08.080
Returning to Clinton.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.400
What did you say
to him?

42:10.400 --> 42:12.280
"Have a safe trip.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.480
"Watch for radar
around Albany."

42:14.480 --> 42:17.360
Aren't they staying
for the christening?

42:17.360 --> 42:19.240
They felt it
redundant.

42:19.240 --> 42:22.600
The Galeckis
have already had
Barbara baptised.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.120
Oh, well, good.

42:24.120 --> 42:25.720
Not really.

42:25.720 --> 42:28.960
She'll be very friendly
with the Pope.

42:28.960 --> 42:30.400
She's Catholic.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.400
Can that be undone?

42:32.400 --> 42:34.280
Not to my knowledge.

42:34.280 --> 42:37.200
I wish I could've
been there.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.080
When Stephen
was baptised,

42:39.080 --> 42:42.600
and the minister sprinkled
water on his head,

42:42.600 --> 42:45.000
he cooed
and smiled sweetly.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.400
A swimmer
from the start.

42:47.400 --> 42:50.280
Well, I'll just tell
Reverend Jamison

42:50.280 --> 42:52.280
to go on home.

42:52.280 --> 42:54.680
We came
for a christening.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.200
We'll have one.

42:56.200 --> 43:00.200
There's nothing wrong
with a double coat
of shellac.

43:00.360 --> 43:04.200
Hey! Hey, Jamison.

43:04.200 --> 43:08.200
Long time no see.

43:29.400 --> 43:32.320
The end of another
chemo cycle?

43:32.320 --> 43:33.760
Thank God.

43:33.760 --> 43:37.240
How's everything going
with the Buell Street
building?

43:37.240 --> 43:40.320
The board is
selling the place.

43:40.320 --> 43:43.640
It will fall
to a wrecker's ball.

43:43.640 --> 43:45.600
Sorry to hear that.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.000
Maybe it's best.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.920
I wanted it
for the residents

43:49.920 --> 43:52.760
and as a monument
to myself.

43:52.760 --> 43:55.120
A tombstone,
if you will.

43:55.120 --> 43:57.400
Being
in a chemo cycle

43:57.400 --> 44:01.400
makes me aware
of the lengthening
shadows of my life.

44:02.200 --> 44:06.200
I was wrong
trying to perpetuate
my memory that way.

44:06.360 --> 44:07.800
You'll be remembered

44:07.800 --> 44:10.200
for things
you've done here...

44:10.200 --> 44:11.720
Not me.

44:11.720 --> 44:15.720
What you do
is very important.

44:17.880 --> 44:21.880
Not as important
as this.

44:22.200 --> 44:25.080
You hate your job,
don't you?

44:25.080 --> 44:27.600
"Primary care
physician's assistant".

44:27.600 --> 44:30.520
Northeastern has
an excellent curriculum.

44:30.520 --> 44:33.360
Can't sign up
until I complete

44:33.360 --> 44:35.760
two years
of junior college.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.200
Who said that?

44:37.200 --> 44:40.080
Dr Westphall said
it's the law.

44:40.080 --> 44:42.000
I love this hospital,

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
but I wish I could
do more, save lives.

44:46.320 --> 44:49.200
I could be
a good PA,

44:49.200 --> 44:52.240
but the signs
say forget it.

44:52.240 --> 44:54.080
Perhaps
there's a way.

44:54.080 --> 44:57.240
I practise illegally
and go to jail.

44:57.240 --> 45:01.240
You could assist me
until you finish
junior college.

45:01.640 --> 45:04.160
You'd do that for me?

45:04.160 --> 45:06.480
You sure it's OK?

45:06.480 --> 45:09.280
We'll play
inside the system.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.560
Bend the rules a bit.

45:11.560 --> 45:15.560
Thanks, Dr Auschlander.

45:19.680 --> 45:23.680
It'll take three years
of night school to finish.

45:23.840 --> 45:25.600
Don't worry, Luther.

45:25.600 --> 46:27.000
I promise you I'll live
until your graduation.
