WEBVTT

00:12.494 --> 00:15.120
<i>The governor has
everything he needs</i>

00:15.163 --> 00:17.372
<i>and no reason to suspect
anything is amiss.</i>

00:17.416 --> 00:19.124
If we can intercept
that caravan,

00:19.167 --> 00:21.668
<i>we can secure both the money
to start our war</i>

00:21.712 --> 00:23.587
<i>and the partner
to help us fight it.</i>

00:23.630 --> 00:25.714
<i>Either we get
Jack and the cache...</i>

00:25.757 --> 00:26.715
or we get nothing.

00:26.758 --> 00:28.091
Where's Vane?

00:28.135 --> 00:30.051
The militia arrived
before he could get away.

00:30.095 --> 00:31.761
<i>We had no choice but to run.</i>

00:31.805 --> 00:33.680
<i>Charles Vane
swinging over Nassau</i>

00:33.724 --> 00:36.057
is a statement we cannot
afford to be made.

00:36.101 --> 00:39.185
You cannot stay. I'll go back
and address the situation.

00:39.229 --> 00:40.395
<i>By the time I'm through,</i>

00:40.439 --> 00:41.730
the governor won't be able
to hang Vane

00:41.773 --> 00:43.565
out of fear
of losing the street.

00:43.609 --> 00:45.483
Set a course to intercept her.

00:45.527 --> 00:48.445
That ship will be upon us
in two hours. Maybe less.

00:48.488 --> 00:50.488
<i>I know you now.
I trust you now.</i>

00:50.532 --> 00:53.199
I love you now. So I will
tell you the absolute truth

00:53.243 --> 00:55.577
about how I'm going to react
when faced with the thing

00:55.621 --> 00:57.495
sitting in that cell
in your fort...

00:57.539 --> 00:58.830
<i>I honestly don't know.</i>

01:01.501 --> 01:03.960
<i>#</i>

02:38.432 --> 02:41.433
<i>#</i>

03:04.833 --> 03:06.291
We're not far now.

03:06.334 --> 03:09.419
We should be sighting
the island soon.

03:09.463 --> 03:12.422
And Hornigold?

03:12.466 --> 03:15.050
<i>He's two miles astern,
give or take.</i>

03:15.093 --> 03:19.179
Managed to keep ahead of him
through the night.

03:19.222 --> 03:22.932
It will be tight ferrying everyone
ashore before he's upon us,

03:22.976 --> 03:27.604
but, uh, Mr. Silver has
suggested a radical solution.

03:32.152 --> 03:34.277
I noticed that you've locked it.

03:34.321 --> 03:38.114
<i>Do you mind me asking
who has the key?</i>

03:38.158 --> 03:40.158
Neptune.

03:40.202 --> 03:43.495
<i>I threw it over the side
a few hours ago.</i>

03:47.793 --> 03:50.835
If you're concerned about
the men stealing from it...

03:50.879 --> 03:52.670
<i>I am concerned about the men
stealing from it.</i>

03:52.714 --> 03:54.798
There's treasure
inside that box,

03:54.841 --> 03:57.717
a handful of which could provide
a lifetime of prosperity.

03:57.761 --> 03:59.010
Facing that kind of temptation,

03:59.054 --> 04:02.430
there are few men
I would trust to self-deny.

04:02.474 --> 04:05.350
<i>But it is not the treasure
that concerns me most.</i>

04:05.393 --> 04:09.395
Charles Vane's sacrifice
is in that box.

04:11.024 --> 04:13.817
If your man is unsuccessful
in seeing to his rescue,

04:13.860 --> 04:17.946
Charles Vane's death
is inside that box.

04:17.988 --> 04:21.533
Along with my good name.

04:21.576 --> 04:24.911
Along with her lost love.

04:24.955 --> 04:29.165
<i>Along with your late
quartermaster's life.</i>

04:29.209 --> 04:33.461
<i>All the awful sacrifices made
to assemble that box</i>

04:33.505 --> 04:34.963
are now part of its contents,

04:35.006 --> 04:38.424
and those things...

04:38.468 --> 04:42.220
are sacred things
that I trust in no man's hands.

04:45.475 --> 04:47.058
<i>The next time
that chest is opened</i>

04:47.102 --> 04:49.227
<i>will be after Anne and I
walk away with it,</i>

04:49.271 --> 04:52.647
And once the smoke is cleared...

04:52.691 --> 04:55.316
and all is done.

04:58.113 --> 05:00.071
Captain, it's time.

05:40.739 --> 05:43.865
"I, Charles Vane,
do hereby plead guilty"

05:43.909 --> 05:48.453
to the charges of treason
and high seas piracy.

05:48.496 --> 05:51.706
<i>I understand that
the sentence for my crimes</i>

05:51.750 --> 05:55.418
is to be hanged by the neck
until dead.

05:55.462 --> 06:00.298
<i>It is my hope that in
exchange for this plea</i>

06:00.342 --> 06:03.092
<i>I might be spared
the humiliation</i>

06:03.136 --> 06:05.345
of a public trial,

06:05.388 --> 06:09.015
and that my execution
be carried out...

06:09.059 --> 06:12.268
"privately and mercifully."

06:20.862 --> 06:23.947
<i>At noon tomorrow, you'll be
transported under guard to the bay,</i>

06:23.990 --> 06:26.324
<i>where you'll be boarded
onto the Shark</i>

06:26.368 --> 06:30.245
and sent to London to face
a Court of the Admiralty.

06:30.288 --> 06:33.164
Agree to this plea, and the
governor will endorse it.

06:33.208 --> 06:36.876
<i>We'll see to it
that it is heard favorably</i>

06:36.920 --> 06:40.088
<i>and your experience in London
will be short and dignified.</i>

06:41.675 --> 06:45.885
Refuse to sign it, and your
experience will be anything but.

06:50.058 --> 06:53.935
You came all the way down here
to ask me to beg for mercy?

06:56.064 --> 06:59.107
<i>What a fantasy
this must have been for you.</i>

06:59.150 --> 07:02.902
Well, even if I did sign that,

07:02.946 --> 07:06.823
we both know how empty
the victory would be,

07:06.866 --> 07:09.325
seeing as you don't give a shit

07:09.369 --> 07:12.078
about my piracy or my treason.

07:13.540 --> 07:16.332
The only crime of mine
that angers you

07:16.376 --> 07:19.335
is the one that
no one else cared enough about

07:19.379 --> 07:20.878
to even call a crime.

07:20.922 --> 07:22.964
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

07:24.759 --> 07:28.219
<i>Is the murder of Richard Guthrie
mentioned anywhere on that page?</i>

07:29.639 --> 07:31.973
You fucking coward.

07:36.187 --> 07:38.646
When Charles Vane
takes something from a man,

07:38.690 --> 07:41.024
he looks him in the eye and
gives him a chance to deny him.

07:41.067 --> 07:43.818
<i>It's all bullshit.</i>

07:43.862 --> 07:45.862
<i>It was always bullshit.</i>

07:45.905 --> 07:48.865
You stole my father from me
in the dead of night

07:48.908 --> 07:50.450
like a rank fucking cutpurse,

07:50.493 --> 07:52.660
and you did it because you
weren't man enough to face me,

07:52.704 --> 07:56.497
to show yourself.

07:56.541 --> 07:59.876
So you found the lowest, cruelest,
weakest deed imaginable

07:59.919 --> 08:02.253
<i>and acted it out
upon an innocent man</i>

08:02.297 --> 08:04.047
<i>with whom you had no quarrel...</i>

08:06.968 --> 08:08.843
knowing that I had finally

08:08.887 --> 08:10.261
begun to build something
with him,

08:10.305 --> 08:13.056
that I was finally
able to see the good in him.

08:13.099 --> 08:15.016
<i>He was a shit.</i>

08:17.270 --> 08:18.561
What did you just say?

08:18.605 --> 08:21.272
He was a cowardly,
selfish, treacherous shit

08:21.316 --> 08:24.484
who cared only for himself
and for you not at all.

08:24.527 --> 08:25.902
You know this.

08:25.945 --> 08:28.738
All your life you knew this.

08:28.782 --> 08:31.741
Then suddenly he walks
back through your door,

08:31.785 --> 08:35.912
<i>tells you he can give you
all of the things you want,</i>

08:35.955 --> 08:39.039
<i>tells you I'm your enemy,
and, just like that,</i>

08:39.083 --> 08:42.960
his love is sacred and mine
is a inconvenient obstacle

08:43.004 --> 08:44.545
to your ambitions.

08:46.299 --> 08:49.425
The life cycle
of your affections...

08:49.469 --> 08:53.471
A man you love
who speaks the truth

08:53.515 --> 08:55.723
shunted aside
in favor of the next

08:55.767 --> 08:58.434
who will tell you
whatever you want to hear.

09:02.816 --> 09:05.066
Goodbye, Charles.

09:07.821 --> 09:10.071
He betrayed you, Eleanor.

09:13.368 --> 09:15.034
When my men
brought him to me first,

09:15.078 --> 09:16.911
he begged for mercy.

09:16.955 --> 09:21.290
Then he promised
to make me rich.

09:21.334 --> 09:24.127
But when he realized
neither had any effect,

09:24.170 --> 09:28.131
he promised
to deliver you to me.

09:28.174 --> 09:32.176
Promised to exchange
your life for his.

09:33.763 --> 09:37.306
That is who
your father was, Eleanor.

09:37.350 --> 09:39.308
And you know it's true.

10:06.629 --> 10:08.921
You're not a man.

10:08.965 --> 10:12.425
You're deformed.
Unformed.

10:12.469 --> 10:17.388
Flesh, bone, and bile,

10:17.432 --> 10:21.476
and missing all that which takes
shape through a mother's love.

10:24.314 --> 10:27.023
You cannot comprehend
what you took from me

10:27.066 --> 10:30.735
or why it was good,

10:30.778 --> 10:33.321
because there is
no goodness in you.

10:36.201 --> 10:39.911
There is no humanity in you,

10:39.954 --> 10:42.663
no capacity for compromise,

10:42.707 --> 10:46.667
nor instinct toward repair,

10:47.754 --> 10:50.588
nor progress.

10:51.925 --> 10:54.592
Nor forgiveness.

11:00.433 --> 11:03.351
You are an animal.

11:13.655 --> 11:16.614
Nassau is moving on
from you, and so am I.

11:20.870 --> 11:22.411
<i>Open up.</i>

11:44.811 --> 11:46.852
What is this?

11:46.896 --> 11:49.105
He insisted upon seeing
his senior counselors.

11:49.148 --> 11:50.982
I see that. Why's he
doing it in his bedroom?

11:51.025 --> 11:53.442
Because I confined him
to his bed.

11:53.486 --> 11:56.112
Confined him?
He was fine a few hours ago.

11:56.155 --> 11:58.614
He collapsed after you left.

11:58.658 --> 12:00.408
I believe his fever
is worsening.

12:00.451 --> 12:04.287
I will do what I can.

12:04.330 --> 12:06.455
How long can we wait
for Captain Hornigold's return

12:06.499 --> 12:10.668
before we can assume that he's failed
to seize Captain Flint's ship?

12:10.712 --> 12:13.713
<i>At which point
I must strongly urge</i>

12:13.756 --> 12:15.631
that we shift preparations

12:15.675 --> 12:17.717
from retrieving
the stolen Urca treasure

12:17.760 --> 12:20.094
<i>to preparing for a Spanish
move against the island.</i>

12:20.138 --> 12:24.056
Gentlemen, if Captain Hornigold
fails to retrieve the cache,

12:24.100 --> 12:27.059
<i>then we will redouble
our efforts and try again.</i>

12:27.103 --> 12:29.478
However, when he returns,

12:29.522 --> 12:31.480
it would be easier for me
to prosecute those efforts

12:31.524 --> 12:33.274
if I am not dead
from exhaustion.

12:33.318 --> 12:35.693
<i>Now, your counsel is invaluable,</i>

12:35.737 --> 12:38.029
<i>but until I'm able
to recover my health,</i>

12:38.072 --> 12:40.406
I ask that all information
you need to relay to me

12:40.450 --> 12:41.699
be done through
Ms. Guthrie here.

12:41.743 --> 12:43.576
I beg your pardon, my lord.

12:43.620 --> 12:47.663
On this issue, I need no counsel, Mr.
Soames, thank you.

12:47.707 --> 12:48.956
<i>Thank you all.</i>

12:50.960 --> 12:53.252
Go away.

13:22.492 --> 13:25.534
You collapsed.

13:25.578 --> 13:26.744
You saw him.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.581
Yes.

13:32.710 --> 13:35.544
I know what you took
with you into that cell.

13:35.588 --> 13:37.922
I don't care what happened.

13:37.965 --> 13:40.007
Just tell me
whether you were able

13:40.051 --> 13:42.551
to leave it behind in that cell.

13:46.849 --> 13:50.059
There is no leaving it behind,

13:50.103 --> 13:53.187
but I'm ready to move forward.

13:57.652 --> 14:00.861
<i>#</i>

14:29.058 --> 14:31.559
<i>Depth at 14 fathoms!</i>

14:31.602 --> 14:34.895
<i>Mr. De Groot,
depth at 14 fathoms.</i>

14:37.066 --> 14:39.859
<i>Hang the starboard
and stern anchors.</i>

14:39.902 --> 14:41.652
Hang the starboard
and the stern anchors.

14:41.696 --> 14:43.779
He thinks we've lost our minds.

14:43.823 --> 14:46.240
Always a possibility.

14:47.535 --> 14:48.868
Well, he's carrying
out the order,

14:48.911 --> 14:51.537
so have to hope he sees
some credibility in it.

14:51.581 --> 14:53.205
That or he doesn't
know how to say no

14:53.249 --> 14:55.750
to the both of us
at the same time.

14:57.754 --> 15:02.590
You still see some credibility
in the idea, don't you?

15:05.720 --> 15:07.636
Are you fucking kidding me?

15:07.680 --> 15:09.138
When I offered this suggestion,

15:09.182 --> 15:11.348
I told you
it was just a suggestion.

15:11.392 --> 15:13.142
You said it would work.

15:13.186 --> 15:16.145
Well, it's a certainty
if we anchor and try and ferry

15:16.189 --> 15:18.939
ourselves and all
our cargo ashore,

15:18.983 --> 15:20.649
our long-boats
will be easy targets

15:20.693 --> 15:22.234
for Hornigold's guns.

15:22.278 --> 15:23.694
In the absence
of any better suggestions,

15:23.738 --> 15:25.821
yours was worth a try.

15:30.912 --> 15:33.162
Depth at 12 fathoms!

15:33.206 --> 15:35.623
Depth at 12 fathoms!

15:37.877 --> 15:40.377
Captain, both anchors
are hung and ready.

15:40.421 --> 15:42.546
<i>Awaiting your order.</i>

15:45.510 --> 15:47.718
<i>Depth at 10 fathoms!</i>

15:53.351 --> 15:55.059
Why isn't he reducing sail?

15:56.771 --> 15:58.354
<i>Depth at eight fathoms!</i>

15:58.397 --> 16:00.856
Depth at eight fathoms!

16:00.900 --> 16:04.777
Captain, if we miss our mark
by as little as a boat length,

16:04.821 --> 16:06.570
it could be catastrophic.

16:06.614 --> 16:08.572
He knows.

16:13.412 --> 16:15.871
Depth at five fathoms!

16:15.915 --> 16:18.290
<i>Depth at five fathoms!</i>

16:30.096 --> 16:31.679
Hard to port,
Mr. Williamson.

16:31.722 --> 16:32.972
Aye, sir.

16:33.015 --> 16:34.306
Let fall the starboard anchor.

16:34.350 --> 16:36.600
Take courses and topgallants.

16:36.644 --> 16:38.894
<i>Let go starboard anchor.</i>

16:38.938 --> 16:41.021
<i>Let go of starboard
anchor, quickly.</i>

17:00.835 --> 17:03.127
Hard to starboard
if you please, Mr. Williamson.

17:10.803 --> 17:13.137
Let fall the stern anchor.

17:13.180 --> 17:15.890
On your stern anchor, let fall!

17:28.487 --> 17:31.113
Surge the stern cable.

17:31.157 --> 17:34.366
Surge the bow.
Ready for impact.

17:55.139 --> 17:57.681
Douse the topsails!

18:07.902 --> 18:10.444
Open the gunports.

18:16.160 --> 18:20.245
Take the courses and come
about on a starboard tack.

18:20.289 --> 18:22.498
Break off our pursuit, sir?

18:22.541 --> 18:26.126
Unless you'd like to approach
into the teeth of his broadsides.

18:26.170 --> 18:27.503
Bring us up the coast.

18:27.546 --> 18:28.921
We'll deploy our men
onto the sand,

18:28.965 --> 18:30.547
free of his great guns,

18:30.591 --> 18:32.841
and then march them in to...

18:32.885 --> 18:35.010
engage.

18:35.054 --> 18:38.806
<i>#</i>

18:42.561 --> 18:44.478
Jesus.

19:04.417 --> 19:05.708
Whoa. Whoa.

19:17.471 --> 19:19.805
You know, my father
used to tell me

19:19.849 --> 19:23.726
that when the world promises
undesirable outcomes,

19:23.769 --> 19:25.978
only a fool believes
he can alter the latter

19:26.022 --> 19:29.189
without first addressing
the state of the former.

19:29.233 --> 19:31.191
Now, we are living in a world

19:31.235 --> 19:34.236
where Nassau
has embraced English rule,

19:34.280 --> 19:37.031
where former pirates
now exchange pleasantries

19:37.074 --> 19:38.907
with soldiers in the street,

19:38.951 --> 19:42.327
and where the last man
to stand up and defy England

19:42.371 --> 19:46.582
is about to be shipped
back there to be hanged.

19:46.625 --> 19:49.626
And exactly no one
seems to give a shit about it.

19:53.257 --> 19:57.760
So I'm here to remedy all that.

19:57.803 --> 20:01.221
Before we go any further, there's
something you need to know.

20:01.265 --> 20:03.390
Circumstances
have changed in town

20:03.434 --> 20:06.602
dramatically since Jack's escape
and Captain Vane's capture.

20:06.645 --> 20:08.562
The governor knows
there was a spy

20:08.606 --> 20:10.647
that made the escape possible.

20:10.691 --> 20:12.149
<i>His people are on high alert.</i>

20:12.193 --> 20:13.400
<i>The street is anxious.</i>

20:13.444 --> 20:14.860
Getting that kind
of information again

20:14.904 --> 20:16.320
may be impossible.

20:16.363 --> 20:17.362
There'll be time
for spies again.

20:17.406 --> 20:19.198
We're not up to that yet.

20:19.241 --> 20:20.949
The first order of business

20:20.993 --> 20:22.743
for which I will need your help

20:22.787 --> 20:24.536
is rescuing Captain Vane.

20:24.580 --> 20:27.164
Rescuing?
There are a hundred redcoats

20:27.208 --> 20:29.583
between him and the
front door of the fort.

20:29.627 --> 20:31.126
<i>Even if there was a way
to get to him,</i>

20:31.170 --> 20:32.961
<i>he's set to be
shipped out tomorrow.</i>

20:33.005 --> 20:34.254
<i>There isn't nearly time
to find it...</i>

20:34.298 --> 20:36.465
Of course there isn't.

20:36.509 --> 20:38.258
So we need to make sure
they don't ship him out.

20:38.302 --> 20:40.844
<i>Not tomorrow, not ever.</i>

20:40.888 --> 20:42.346
<i>We force them to try him here.</i>

20:42.389 --> 20:44.515
Buy ourselves days, maybe weeks,

20:44.558 --> 20:46.016
while they figure out a process

20:46.060 --> 20:48.143
and we find a plan
to set him free.

20:48.187 --> 20:49.937
How?

20:51.357 --> 20:52.898
How do we keep him off the ship?

20:55.736 --> 20:57.986
By making sure people
give a shit about it.

21:20.803 --> 21:22.511
You sent for me?

21:22.555 --> 21:24.805
Dr. Marcus says that
the stress of receiving visitors

21:24.849 --> 21:25.973
is aggravating his condition,

21:26.016 --> 21:28.684
so I will seal off
this room from today.

21:28.727 --> 21:30.144
No one will be permitted in

21:30.187 --> 21:31.395
other than myself
and the doctor.

21:32.731 --> 21:35.190
As long as this state
of affairs is necessary,

21:35.234 --> 21:37.526
I would like you to tend to him.

21:37.570 --> 21:40.237
Of course.

21:45.786 --> 21:47.703
How long has he been asleep?

21:47.746 --> 21:51.874
He woke a few hours ago
just for a moment.

21:51.917 --> 21:55.252
Did you inform him
of this plan to sequester him?

21:55.296 --> 21:57.880
No.
Why not?

21:57.923 --> 22:00.841
Because he looked at me
and addressed me as Sarah.

22:00.885 --> 22:02.050
He thought I was his wife.

22:07.766 --> 22:10.684
He was delirious with fever.

22:10.728 --> 22:13.937
If his condition changes,
please send word.

22:18.736 --> 22:21.486
<i>#</i>

22:51.810 --> 22:53.644
Is that it?

22:53.687 --> 22:56.688
<i>It is.</i>

22:56.732 --> 22:59.233
How long before
their force arrives?

22:59.276 --> 23:01.985
A few days for Captain Hornigold
to return to Nassau

23:02.029 --> 23:05.447
and report that the cache
is defended by a small army.

23:05.491 --> 23:09.243
<i>Three days to muster
soldiers and supply ships.</i>

23:09.286 --> 23:12.162
A week, more or less,

23:12.206 --> 23:14.998
before the governor's forces
arrive on our coasts.

23:15.042 --> 23:16.959
Then we have much
preparation to do

23:17.002 --> 23:18.502
and little time to do it.

23:20.381 --> 23:22.798
What happened to him?

23:27.846 --> 23:30.764
It was all a misunderstanding.

23:43.362 --> 23:45.445
What was that?

23:45.489 --> 23:47.114
What was what?

23:47.157 --> 23:50.826
You told me that that man was
taken to task by her bodyguard.

23:50.869 --> 23:52.661
Was that not the case?

23:52.705 --> 23:54.997
Dobbs assaulted him.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.790
He believes him responsible

23:56.834 --> 23:59.293
for choosing the men
to be interrogated by them.

23:59.336 --> 24:02.963
I didn't mention it
to you because...

24:03.007 --> 24:06.675
I don't know.
I just didn't.

24:06.719 --> 24:08.468
But it's been sorted.

24:11.265 --> 24:14.725
Good. Sorted how?

24:14.768 --> 24:19.271
I had three men hold him down while
Dooley and Wayne administered a beating.

24:19.315 --> 24:22.816
The message was received.
I'm quite certain.

24:24.361 --> 24:26.570
Sorted.

24:54.141 --> 24:55.223
We were successful.

24:55.267 --> 24:58.435
The war we sought
will soon be under way.

24:58.479 --> 25:00.771
On our terms.

25:07.821 --> 25:11.990
I was there in Nassau,

25:12.034 --> 25:14.493
and she's there.

25:14.536 --> 25:17.204
Eleanor is there.

25:19.666 --> 25:23.085
In a position
of great influence, they say,

25:23.128 --> 25:25.796
at the right hand
of the governor.

25:25.839 --> 25:29.049
She is one of them now.

25:33.806 --> 25:37.099
I stood in Nassau and I realized

25:37.142 --> 25:39.518
when this war begins,

25:39.561 --> 25:41.770
it will have
many different meanings,

25:41.814 --> 25:45.816
but to you, this war
is a civil war

25:47.194 --> 25:50.779
between two cities
you held together for so long

25:50.823 --> 25:55.617
with unseen bonds.

25:55.661 --> 26:00.038
You will have people
on both sides of it.

26:00.082 --> 26:04.960
You will have daughters
on both sides of it.

26:05.003 --> 26:06.294
And I want you to know...

26:12.261 --> 26:16.221
Only... you.

26:34.783 --> 26:37.325
You have information
about the identity

26:37.369 --> 26:38.869
of the spy within our midst.

26:44.334 --> 26:46.126
It's Idelle.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.672
She's the one
that learned the secret route

26:50.716 --> 26:53.008
for the governor's caravan.

26:53.051 --> 26:56.720
The one that made possible
Captain Rackham's escape.

26:59.141 --> 27:01.475
Have you told anyone of this?

27:01.518 --> 27:04.019
No.

27:06.648 --> 27:09.691
Why not?

27:09.735 --> 27:11.234
I beg your pardon, ma'am?

27:11.278 --> 27:16.198
I know Eleanor engaged you
those months ago to watch me.

27:16.241 --> 27:18.533
If you took
this information to her,

27:18.577 --> 27:23.079
it would likely garner you
credit with her at my expense.

27:24.041 --> 27:26.708
I know you have considered it.

27:26.752 --> 27:29.544
I am asking why
you did not do it.

27:31.632 --> 27:33.882
Eleanor Guthrie used that chair

27:33.926 --> 27:36.301
not just
to vanquish her enemies,

27:36.345 --> 27:39.721
but to create new ones.

27:39.765 --> 27:43.391
<i>Because some people can only
understand themselves</i>

27:43.435 --> 27:46.394
<i>through the eyes
of those who hate them.</i>

27:48.732 --> 27:51.358
They thrive only
on sowing the seeds

27:51.401 --> 27:53.276
of their own
eventual destruction.

27:53.320 --> 27:56.238
<i>Miss Guthrie
has new clothes now.</i>

27:56.281 --> 27:58.156
<i>Miss Guthrie
has new friends now.</i>

27:58.200 --> 28:01.952
But to my eye,
she looks the same.

28:04.289 --> 28:06.414
You think
I will outlast her here,

28:06.458 --> 28:10.418
so you would cast your lot
with me and not her?

28:10.462 --> 28:13.380
Something like that.
Yes, ma'am.

28:17.636 --> 28:21.763
Will you please make sure, when
the governor's men visit the inn,

28:21.807 --> 28:24.599
they are serviced
by girls you trust?

28:24.643 --> 28:28.853
There will be no more information
seeping out of the inn.

28:28.897 --> 28:30.564
Of course.

28:33.443 --> 28:37.862
Will you tell her?
Miss Guthrie.

28:37.906 --> 28:40.240
Will you inform her
of our suspicions

28:40.284 --> 28:42.409
<i>about the source of the leak?</i>

28:44.454 --> 28:47.914
Davis... Davis, you remember
the time the captain...

28:47.958 --> 28:49.124
<i>Do you know him?</i>

28:49.167 --> 28:52.460
I do not.

28:52.504 --> 28:55.880
But Featherstone says he's one of the
most gifted purveyors of bullshit

28:55.924 --> 28:57.632
he's ever met.

28:57.676 --> 29:01.219
And a man determined, above anything
else in life, to be famous.

29:01.263 --> 29:03.763
<i>Which makes him
the perfect fit for us.</i>

29:03.807 --> 29:07.183
Stronger and safer
than ever was before.

29:07.227 --> 29:09.644
<i>What's he saying?</i>

29:09.688 --> 29:11.813
<i>The governor wants him
to believe that Charles Vane</i>

29:11.857 --> 29:13.315
<i>is the cause of all their ill.</i>

29:13.358 --> 29:15.400
It's a lot easier
to watch a man swing

29:15.444 --> 29:18.111
if you're comfortable
hating him just a little bit.

29:18.155 --> 29:21.489
His task is to start
reminding everyone

29:21.533 --> 29:22.824
there's someone else out there

29:22.868 --> 29:25.535
that they're far more
comfortable hating.

29:25.579 --> 29:29.164
Who?

29:44.556 --> 29:46.389
What is it?

29:46.433 --> 29:51.019
When I sent for you, there
were approximately 20 of them.

29:51.063 --> 29:54.522
In ten minutes,
it has grown two-fold.

29:54.566 --> 29:57.901
What is he saying?

29:57.944 --> 30:00.195
That the law and order
promised by the new regime

30:00.238 --> 30:02.572
is little more than a veneer,

30:02.616 --> 30:04.616
<i>behind which Eleanor Guthrie
has returned</i>

30:04.660 --> 30:09.663
to settle old scores and restore her
tyranny over Nassau once again.

30:12.501 --> 30:14.542
I hear they will threaten
to stand in the way

30:14.586 --> 30:17.379
<i>of any attempt to remove
Charles Vane off the island,</i>

30:17.422 --> 30:22.092
that if he's to be tried,
it must be here, in the open,

30:22.135 --> 30:24.010
where they can see it
with their own eyes.

30:24.054 --> 30:26.054
Fucking kidding me.

30:26.098 --> 30:27.597
Vane is scheduled to be moved

30:27.641 --> 30:29.933
from the fort to the Shark
in a few hours.

30:29.976 --> 30:32.394
Chamberlain is making
arrangements right now.

30:32.437 --> 30:34.104
Is there anything
you can do about this?

30:34.147 --> 30:35.480
<i>To dispel
what is building down there,</i>

30:35.524 --> 30:37.774
it is going
to require appeasement

30:37.818 --> 30:39.943
or it is going to require force.

30:39.986 --> 30:42.529
Appeasement.
Hold his trial here.

30:42.572 --> 30:45.365
To begin with,
the lawyers aren't even sure

30:45.409 --> 30:46.574
that we have the authority
to do that

30:46.618 --> 30:48.535
without a judge yet appointed,

30:48.578 --> 30:50.453
and even if it were legitimate,

30:50.497 --> 30:52.706
proceeding like that
would last weeks.

30:52.749 --> 30:56.126
Dredge up a dark past just when
progress is so near at hand.

30:56.169 --> 30:58.420
<i>If the alternative
is an armed clash</i>

30:58.463 --> 31:00.296
<i>between those men
and the dozens of soldiers</i>

31:00.340 --> 31:01.756
<i>it would take to subdue them,</i>

31:01.800 --> 31:03.967
a little time
spent confronting the past

31:04.010 --> 31:05.385
may be the lesser evil.

31:05.429 --> 31:08.054
I can't believe
this is a coincidence...

31:08.098 --> 31:10.265
A plot to steal the cache
followed so closely

31:10.308 --> 31:11.599
by something
as choreographed as this.

31:17.482 --> 31:19.566
I'll take this to the governor.

31:19.609 --> 31:23.403
You should be careful.

31:23.447 --> 31:26.156
I understand the governor
has tasked you

31:26.199 --> 31:29.159
with being his eyes and ears
while he convalesces.

31:29.202 --> 31:30.952
In this particular instance,

31:30.996 --> 31:32.537
you would be wise to make sure,

31:32.581 --> 31:34.205
whatever happens
to Captain Vane,

31:34.249 --> 31:36.291
those men have no reason

31:36.334 --> 31:39.043
to believe it happened
because of you.

31:40.839 --> 31:43.089
Whatever happens will be
the governor's decision.

31:43.133 --> 31:44.591
Of course.

31:56.188 --> 31:59.272
Any change?
No.

32:01.693 --> 32:04.027
May I have a moment
with him, please?

32:23.507 --> 32:25.381
I warned you...

32:28.178 --> 32:29.677
the closer
you let me get to you,

32:29.721 --> 32:31.471
the more dangerous I would be.

32:35.477 --> 32:38.895
I've never given a damn
what people think of me.

32:38.939 --> 32:41.314
But I give a damn
what you think.

32:43.109 --> 32:44.734
I hope that when you wake,

32:44.778 --> 32:48.112
you will understand
why I did what I did,

32:48.156 --> 32:51.908
you will see that it
was all I could think to do

32:51.952 --> 32:55.537
to protect you...

32:55.580 --> 32:57.455
the only way I know how.

33:16.434 --> 33:18.518
Any news?

33:18.562 --> 33:20.061
They say it shouldn't
be long now

33:20.105 --> 33:22.230
before Mr. Scott
leaves us.

33:28.780 --> 33:31.698
We need to talk about that.

33:34.286 --> 33:36.744
<i>What about it?</i>

33:36.788 --> 33:38.621
We're about to enter
into a battle

33:38.665 --> 33:40.665
where every man
must be behind us

33:40.709 --> 33:42.667
as any man with motive
not to be so

33:42.711 --> 33:44.002
could sink us.

33:44.045 --> 33:46.588
<i>It would seem
that you have made sure</i>

33:46.631 --> 33:48.756
<i>that he has one.</i>

33:48.800 --> 33:52.802
If it'd gotten out, what he did,

33:52.846 --> 33:56.055
you would likely be stranded
back in Nassau.

33:56.099 --> 33:57.432
Most of our men would be dead,

33:57.475 --> 33:58.683
and those that weren't

33:58.727 --> 34:01.019
would be back
in those cages right now.

34:01.062 --> 34:05.732
So you sent the vanguard to make
sure that he understood this?

34:06.276 --> 34:09.110
To prevent him
from getting any ideas

34:09.154 --> 34:11.946
about doing it again, yes.

34:17.661 --> 34:18.911
If you have something to add,

34:18.955 --> 34:20.038
you should just fucking say it.

34:20.081 --> 34:21.456
That's not why you did it.

34:21.498 --> 34:25.877
Really? Would you like to
tell me why I did it, then?

34:25.920 --> 34:27.837
Well, I wasn't there,

34:27.880 --> 34:32.132
but, um, I'd hazard the guess

34:32.177 --> 34:36.137
that you learned
of what had happened,

34:36.181 --> 34:39.431
told him
how fucking stupid he was,

34:39.476 --> 34:41.141
and in that moment,

34:41.186 --> 34:43.770
he gave you a look
that amounted to something

34:43.813 --> 34:45.438
less than contrite.

34:45.482 --> 34:49.359
And in that moment, you felt it.

34:49.402 --> 34:50.818
Felt what?

34:50.862 --> 34:52.695
Darkness.

34:54.991 --> 34:56.407
Hate.

34:56.451 --> 34:59.994
Showing indifference
to the authority

35:00.038 --> 35:02.622
that you sacrificed
so much to acquire,

35:02.666 --> 35:07.460
<i>disdain for refusing
to acknowledge</i>

35:07.504 --> 35:09.587
<i>that his actions,
had you not intervened,</i>

35:09.631 --> 35:11.089
<i>would have led to an outcome</i>

35:11.132 --> 35:15.343
that he would have held you
responsible for reversing.

35:15.387 --> 35:18.596
<i>Pride.</i>

35:18.640 --> 35:20.765
Questioning what kind
of man you are

35:20.809 --> 35:23.643
if you don't seek retribution
for the offense.

35:25.981 --> 35:28.648
So what are you saying?

35:28.692 --> 35:31.859
You saying
I went too far with him?

35:31.903 --> 35:34.028
Maybe you went too far.

35:34.072 --> 35:35.530
Maybe you didn't go far enough.

35:35.573 --> 35:37.281
Maybe you did it just right.

35:37.325 --> 35:39.534
The point is that
while you were doing it,

35:39.577 --> 35:44.080
you heard a voice telling you
that disciplining him

35:44.708 --> 35:48.084
would prevent him
from repeating the offense,

35:48.128 --> 35:50.712
a voice
that sounded like reason,

35:50.755 --> 35:52.463
and there was reason to it,

35:52.507 --> 35:54.924
as the most compelling lies

35:54.968 --> 35:59.095
<i>are comprised almost
entirely of the truth.</i>

35:59.139 --> 36:02.974
But that's what it does.

36:04.894 --> 36:06.811
<i>Cloaks itself
in whatever it must</i>

36:06.855 --> 36:08.563
<i>to move you to action.</i>

36:08.606 --> 36:10.314
<i>And the more
you deny its presence,</i>

36:10.358 --> 36:11.774
<i>the more powerful it gets,</i>

36:11.818 --> 36:15.903
and the more likely it is
to consume you entirely

36:15.947 --> 36:18.531
without you ever
even knowing it was there.

36:22.162 --> 36:26.998
<i>Now, if you and I
are to lead these men together,</i>

36:28.126 --> 36:32.545
you must learn to know
its presence well

36:32.589 --> 36:37.216
so that you may use it...
Rather than it use you.

36:40.889 --> 36:44.348
You have some experience
with this, I imagine,

36:44.392 --> 36:47.602
<i>living in fear
of such a thing within you?</i>

36:47.645 --> 36:49.437
Yeah, I do.

36:56.362 --> 36:59.697
I can't tell
if this was a warning

36:59.741 --> 37:02.158
or a welcome.

37:25.475 --> 37:28.810
<i>#</i>

37:56.089 --> 38:00.716
I need to make an offering
at his burial.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.886
Something of mine
that he can take with him.

38:09.727 --> 38:11.644
I'm sorry. I...

38:13.565 --> 38:15.731
I don't know what to say.

38:50.351 --> 38:52.018
What?

38:52.061 --> 38:53.686
I'm sorry. I didn't get
word until it was done.

38:53.730 --> 38:54.854
I came immediately.

38:54.898 --> 38:56.105
Well, what happened?

38:56.149 --> 38:58.733
The crew of the Shark
is standing down.

38:58.776 --> 39:00.401
The governor
has scrapped his plans

39:00.445 --> 39:02.028
to move Captain Vane
off the island

39:02.071 --> 39:04.238
and then scheduled
an accelerated trial

39:04.282 --> 39:05.615
for the captain here in Nassau.

39:05.658 --> 39:08.117
Shit. When did they
schedule it to begin?

39:08.161 --> 39:10.161
In the middle of the night.
Last night.

39:10.205 --> 39:11.537
It's already happened.

39:11.581 --> 39:13.164
You said there
was no judge appointed here.

39:13.208 --> 39:15.166
It was supposed to take days before
they could start the process.

39:15.210 --> 39:17.251
They appointed a judge,
they impaneled a jury.

39:17.295 --> 39:18.961
It was over before
anyone knew it began.

39:19.005 --> 39:20.922
Where is Vane now?

39:20.965 --> 39:21.964
<i>Still in the fort.</i>

39:22.008 --> 39:23.341
But when I left the street,

39:23.384 --> 39:24.842
they were carrying the timber

39:24.886 --> 39:27.428
to assemble a gallows
in the square.

39:27.472 --> 39:30.348
They mean to hang him today.

39:36.564 --> 39:38.773
<i>The governor is still
in need of bed rest,</i>

39:38.816 --> 39:41.359
<i>but Dr. Marcus will inform us
when that situation changes.</i>

39:41.402 --> 39:43.277
Gentlemen.

39:55.208 --> 39:58.417
When the governor arrived
and the island embraced him,

39:58.461 --> 40:00.628
a bargain was struck.

40:00.672 --> 40:05.132
Authority was ceded, in exchange
for which the law returned.

40:05.176 --> 40:08.552
Law, which constrained
that authority,

40:08.596 --> 40:10.638
made outcomes more predictable.

40:10.682 --> 40:15.142
But this outcome would
seem most unpredictable.

40:15.186 --> 40:17.019
The law was adhered to.

40:17.063 --> 40:19.438
If the bargain changes,

40:19.482 --> 40:23.192
there is no telling what else
will change as a result...

40:23.236 --> 40:25.152
What trust may be lost

40:25.196 --> 40:27.196
and what chaos may abound.

40:31.327 --> 40:33.536
I am your friend,

40:33.579 --> 40:37.331
and I will help you
weather whatever challenges

40:37.375 --> 40:40.126
may lie down whatever road
you may choose,

40:40.169 --> 40:43.421
but as your friend,
I am simply asking you

40:43.464 --> 40:46.299
to consider how treacherous
this road may be...

40:46.342 --> 40:50.303
While there is still time
to avoid it.

40:50.346 --> 40:54.015
No one is taking this decision
lightly, I assure you.

40:54.058 --> 40:56.976
This is no attempt
to circumvent the law.

40:57.020 --> 40:59.186
Indeed, the governor
felt that it was necessary

40:59.230 --> 41:01.355
in order to protect it.

41:03.651 --> 41:07.028
It was a hard choice.

41:07.071 --> 41:10.031
But an earnest one.

42:03.127 --> 42:06.253
I assume you understand
what is to happen,

42:06.297 --> 42:08.881
as soon as everything begins.

42:10.802 --> 42:12.885
<i>It'll be loud, confusing.</i>

42:16.557 --> 42:18.391
<i>Men who've never
experienced fear</i>

42:18.434 --> 42:20.226
<i>are said to know it
for the first time.</i>

42:22.313 --> 42:24.855
But in this moment,
there is quiet.

42:24.899 --> 42:29.276
An opportunity to find
some measure of peace.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.489
I would like
to help you do that.

42:33.533 --> 42:36.784
You've done this before?

42:36.828 --> 42:39.036
I have.

42:39.080 --> 42:41.122
Regretfully, I have.

42:41.165 --> 42:43.791
Get many takers, do you?

42:43.835 --> 42:46.502
For the kind of peace
you're offering?

42:49.257 --> 42:51.132
<i>It is a different experience</i>

42:51.175 --> 42:55.511
<i>to what you may
imagine it being.</i>

42:55.555 --> 42:57.596
<i>Surely a man like you
has faced death before,</i>

42:57.640 --> 42:59.932
<i>but never so nakedly.</i>

42:59.976 --> 43:02.268
<i>And cloaked in glory
or sacrifice,</i>

43:02.311 --> 43:06.147
fully exposed in all
its horror and finality.

43:07.400 --> 43:10.151
<i>In this moment,
you have the opportunity</i>

43:10.194 --> 43:13.279
<i>to enter into that moment
with a clear conscience.</i>

43:15.658 --> 43:17.491
<i>I can help you do that.</i>

43:18.619 --> 43:20.494
<i>To repent.</i>

43:23.249 --> 43:26.876
I have nothing
to repent for with you.

43:26.919 --> 43:29.003
Don't you?

43:34.886 --> 43:39.430
I understand the code
you subscribe to.

43:39.474 --> 43:40.848
I understand you believe
your violence

43:40.892 --> 43:43.976
is justified in the name
of a defiance of tyranny,

43:44.020 --> 43:47.688
<i>but there are mothers who buried
their sons because of you.</i>

43:49.150 --> 43:52.526
<i>Wives widowed because of you.</i>

43:52.570 --> 43:54.695
<i>Children awoken in their sleep</i>

43:54.739 --> 43:57.865
<i>to be told their father was never
coming home because of you.</i>

43:57.909 --> 44:00.868
<i>What kind of a man can
experience no remorse from this?</i>

44:00.912 --> 44:04.538
Whatever remorse I have
or do not have is my own.

44:04.582 --> 44:08.626
That I choose not
to share it with you

44:08.669 --> 44:12.254
says more about you
than it does about me.

44:14.634 --> 44:16.050
Me?

44:16.093 --> 44:18.969
<i>I am a shepherd</i>

44:19.013 --> 44:22.014
sent to help you find a path
to God's forgiveness.

44:22.058 --> 44:25.392
A shepherd?

44:25.436 --> 44:27.186
You are the sheep.

44:32.693 --> 44:34.568
And whatever
I have to say to God,

44:34.612 --> 44:37.029
I'll tell him myself
or not at all.

44:41.869 --> 44:45.412
<i>When our lord governor
arrived here,</i>

44:45.456 --> 44:48.374
he promised you things.

44:49.961 --> 44:53.128
Order. Prosperity.

44:53.172 --> 44:55.005
How many men are with you?

44:55.049 --> 44:56.757
A dozen.

44:56.801 --> 44:58.342
I don't know how far they'll go.

44:58.386 --> 45:00.469
Not in the face
of all that out there.

45:00.513 --> 45:02.304
That'll have to be enough.

45:02.348 --> 45:04.098
Position your men
around the crowd.

45:04.141 --> 45:05.891
Tell them to be ready to move.

45:05.935 --> 45:07.393
I'm gonna try to shout him down,

45:07.436 --> 45:09.770
raise Eleanor Guthrie,
raise whatever I have to

45:09.814 --> 45:11.272
to try and strike a chord.

45:11.315 --> 45:13.482
Turn as much of that crowd
as I can in our favor.

45:13.526 --> 45:15.067
Your men should take my lead.

45:15.111 --> 45:17.194
Hopefully it'll be enough
to start a frenzy,

45:17.238 --> 45:20.239
cause enough confusion to break
the ranks of the soldiers.

45:20.283 --> 45:21.448
Then in the chaos of it,

45:21.492 --> 45:23.576
we'll make a move
to free Captain Vane.

45:23.619 --> 45:24.743
Go.

45:25.871 --> 45:27.830
<i>Do it!</i>

45:27.873 --> 45:30.499
Men who are not men at all,

45:30.543 --> 45:33.294
but beasts governed
by the base instinct,

45:33.337 --> 45:36.672
incapable of anything
but the most primal behaviors.

45:38.718 --> 45:41.552
<i>A constant threat
to every decent,</i>

45:41.596 --> 45:44.179
<i>God-fearing citizen
among us.</i>

45:44.223 --> 45:47.182
<i>As long as those men roam free,</i>

45:47.226 --> 45:51.103
<i>strife will endure,
fear will abound,</i>

45:51.147 --> 45:53.647
<i>and progress will elude us.</i>

45:53.691 --> 45:56.609
<i>Today marks the silencing</i>

45:56.652 --> 45:59.486
<i>of the most disruptive
of those voices</i>

45:59.530 --> 46:01.530
<i>and a step towards the return</i>

46:01.574 --> 46:04.283
<i>of civilization in Nassau.</i>

46:04.327 --> 46:06.994
<i>But we must always remember</i>

46:07.038 --> 46:10.748
<i>however strong the need for
the removal of these traitors,</i>

46:10.791 --> 46:13.709
<i>these relics
of a more savage age,</i>

46:13.753 --> 46:16.420
<i>there is no relish
in this moment,</i>

46:16.464 --> 46:19.173
<i>but there is righteousness</i>

46:19.216 --> 46:21.342
<i>and comfort
in the knowledge that...</i>

46:21.385 --> 46:22.843
What's happening?

46:22.887 --> 46:24.178
Wait.

46:24.221 --> 46:25.179
Billy, they're about
to tie the noose.

46:25.222 --> 46:28.223
I know, just...

46:28.267 --> 46:29.683
wait.

46:29.727 --> 46:31.185
<i>And that God's will</i>

46:31.228 --> 46:35.022
<i>will be done again in Nassau.</i>

46:38.694 --> 46:40.778
Bastard!
Hang him!

46:42.573 --> 46:46.033
<i>Does the condemned
have anything to say</i>

46:46.077 --> 46:50.371
<i>before the sentence
is carried out?</i>

46:57.088 --> 47:00.589
These men who
brought me here today

47:00.633 --> 47:02.508
do not fear me.

47:04.345 --> 47:07.596
They brought me here today
because they fear you.

47:09.684 --> 47:12.309
<i>Because they know that my voice,</i>

47:12.353 --> 47:15.813
<i>a voice that refuses
to be enslaved,</i>

47:15.856 --> 47:18.440
once lived in you.

47:18.484 --> 47:20.192
And may yet still.

47:23.948 --> 47:26.907
They brought me here today
to show you death

47:26.951 --> 47:29.076
and use it to frighten you

47:29.120 --> 47:31.036
into ignoring that voice.

47:33.290 --> 47:35.416
<i>But know this.</i>

47:35.459 --> 47:38.961
We are many.
They are few.

47:40.798 --> 47:45.217
To fear death is a choice.

47:45.261 --> 47:48.387
And they can't hang us all.

47:58.733 --> 48:00.899
Get on with it, motherfucker.

48:02.570 --> 48:06.447
<i>#</i>

48:06.490 --> 48:09.616
Billy.

48:09.660 --> 48:13.078
It's all right.

48:36.729 --> 48:39.855
Proceed.

49:32.660 --> 49:35.661
Now. Go.

50:02.565 --> 50:06.024
<i>#</i>

50:14.451 --> 50:15.576
Why?

50:17.997 --> 50:19.788
It was the only way to start it.

50:21.417 --> 50:23.709
He knew it was the only way.

50:23.752 --> 50:26.003
Start what?

50:29.133 --> 50:31.550
Look at them.

50:37.808 --> 50:39.558
Men, move along.

50:41.437 --> 50:42.728
Move along.

50:42.771 --> 50:45.606
The resistance in Nassau
is now under way.

51:39.244 --> 51:44.039
Another sacrifice for the cause.

51:44.083 --> 51:47.000
And that chest of ours
only gets heavier.

51:49.546 --> 51:51.505
How many, do you imagine?

51:51.548 --> 51:53.340
Soldiers in the English force.

51:53.384 --> 51:55.592
How many do you imagine
we'll face?

51:55.636 --> 51:58.387
500, more or less.

52:03.310 --> 52:04.726
Is that so?

52:04.770 --> 52:08.188
From what I saw, I'd say
seven is a reasonable guess.

52:08.232 --> 52:10.774
And that's assuming he doesn't
call in reinforcements

52:10.818 --> 52:13.360
from Carolina, Virginia.

52:13.404 --> 52:17.239
There's no shortage of men eager
to kill pirates these days.

52:19.827 --> 52:23.704
I walked that beach today.

52:23.747 --> 52:26.331
The terrain inland
may be to her advantage,

52:26.375 --> 52:27.874
but that beach is not.

52:27.918 --> 52:30.168
The shore is too broad,
the water too deep.

52:30.212 --> 52:32.754
Their anchorages will get
far closer to the sand

52:32.798 --> 52:34.923
than you'd like.

52:34.967 --> 52:38.093
Even with defensive positions
engineered in the bluffs,

52:38.137 --> 52:39.636
it will be an uphill struggle

52:39.680 --> 52:42.889
to offer any meaningful resistance
at all to their landings.

52:42.933 --> 52:44.266
All struggles are uphill.

52:44.309 --> 52:47.269
That's why
they're called struggles.

52:47.312 --> 52:48.979
That's quite true.

52:49.023 --> 52:52.024
But there is an aspect
to this particular struggle

52:52.067 --> 52:54.526
I don't believe
you've yet cracked.

52:54.570 --> 52:58.655
I understand your tactical
deployment of the Walrus.

52:58.699 --> 53:00.657
She'll be massively outnumbered,

53:00.701 --> 53:02.409
but still a critical asset.

53:02.453 --> 53:04.286
I also understand you intend

53:04.329 --> 53:06.538
to place your Mr. De Groot
in command of her.

53:08.125 --> 53:09.916
He'll manage.

53:09.960 --> 53:13.879
Yes, but he wasn't
your first choice.

53:13.922 --> 53:17.507
It was supposed
to be Charles, wasn't it?

53:20.012 --> 53:22.888
Are you suggesting
a better replacement?

53:24.308 --> 53:25.640
Me.

53:25.684 --> 53:28.769
England may have removed
Charles Vane from our number,

53:28.812 --> 53:30.729
but there is too much
of him in me

53:30.773 --> 53:32.647
for England to fully
will him away.

53:32.691 --> 53:36.109
In his absence,
with everything that's at stake,

53:36.153 --> 53:38.278
I will be our Charles Vane.

53:53.796 --> 53:55.629
I've just come back
from the beach,

53:55.672 --> 53:57.422
and I couldn't help but notice

53:57.466 --> 53:59.800
the three additional ships
anchored in the bay

53:59.843 --> 54:02.636
being outfitted for this
battle right along with mine.

54:02.679 --> 54:05.722
Captain Hornigold will be
sailing in consort with you,

54:05.766 --> 54:08.225
accompanied by
his private militia.

54:08.268 --> 54:10.685
Mr. Underhill has formed
a special company of men

54:10.729 --> 54:12.938
from the ranks
of his plantation staff,

54:12.981 --> 54:15.982
men with experience hunting
and capturing slaves.

54:16.026 --> 54:17.818
I will not go into battle

54:17.861 --> 54:20.278
alongside undisciplined
conscripts.

54:20.322 --> 54:22.656
The force I bring to bear

54:22.699 --> 54:24.199
is sufficient to combat
whatever awaits us.

54:24.243 --> 54:27.327
Jesus. He wants the force
you bring to bear.

54:27.371 --> 54:29.621
He wants it.

54:29.665 --> 54:31.665
<i>I know this enemy, Commodore.</i>

54:31.708 --> 54:34.126
<i>I know his mind.</i>

54:34.169 --> 54:36.753
<i>He took that cache
with the express purpose</i>

54:36.797 --> 54:39.047
<i>of compelling us
to commit your force</i>

54:39.091 --> 54:41.591
<i>to a battlefield
of his choosing.</i>

54:41.635 --> 54:43.301
<i>Your force is factored
into his thinking.</i>

54:43.345 --> 54:44.761
<i>He has planned for it.</i>

54:44.805 --> 54:47.848
<i>And I assure you,
if you allow him</i>

54:47.891 --> 54:49.683
<i>to dictate the terms of battle,</i>

54:49.726 --> 54:52.435
<i>you court a disastrous outcome.</i>

54:52.479 --> 54:54.437
<i>If he expects your force,</i>

54:54.481 --> 54:57.691
<i>then we must send that
which he does not expect.</i>

54:57.734 --> 55:00.610
<i>For we will have victory
against this enemy.</i>

55:00.654 --> 55:02.779
<i>There simply is no alternative.</i>

55:33.770 --> 55:36.563
Just returned
from around the point.

55:36.607 --> 55:40.442
<i>The word is spreading
throughout the Bahamas</i>

55:40.485 --> 55:45.322
<i>that the governor in Nassau
hanged a pirate in his square.</i>

55:47.409 --> 55:49.910
<i>Made an example of him,
they say,</i>

55:49.953 --> 55:52.996
<i>to show that he is the steward
of law and order</i>

55:53.040 --> 55:54.873
<i>in the West Indies.</i>

55:54.917 --> 55:57.417
<i>He is resolved
to be the Englishman</i>

55:57.461 --> 56:00.045
<i>who ends piracy
in the New World.</i>

56:03.467 --> 56:05.508
<i>The pirate
he hanged in the square</i>

56:05.552 --> 56:07.594
<i>to underscore his point...</i>

56:09.014 --> 56:11.097
<i>was Charles Vane.</i>

56:11.141 --> 56:13.642
<i>#</i>

56:15.270 --> 56:16.937
<i>I have yet to inform the men,</i>

56:16.980 --> 56:19.064
<i>as I imagine
they'll have questions</i>

56:19.107 --> 56:22.442
<i>I don't know how to answer,</i>

56:22.486 --> 56:25.195
<i>so I wanted to ask you first.</i>

56:27.407 --> 56:29.824
<i>What do you want to do about it?</i>

56:31.787 --> 56:33.703
<i>#</i>

56:36.750 --> 56:39.626
<i>#</i>
