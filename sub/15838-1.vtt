The last apple.

Marion, when's the next
available court date?

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:44.552
- We have to go to court?
GUS: We are merely attorneys, Mrs. Farmer...

...handmaidens of the law.
Only a judge can dissolve a marriage.

01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:51.058
A circuit judge will be here
next month...

on your personal injury, it seems.

in another matter?

Yes, sir.

...filled with hopes and dreams
for a better life and a better place.

01:20:13.099 --> 01:20:16.060
And basically, we've seen
those hopes and dreams...

...shattered and crushed
before our very eyes.

We're as much to blame for this as you.

- Sit down.

The covers of these magazines were
painted by a man named Norman Rockwell.

about small-town life.
