WEBVTT

00:04.178 --> 00:06.571
- Look, we all know
Scully has the hardest head,

00:06.615 --> 00:08.530
but what concerns me
is the speed factor.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.184
- Squad, listen up!
- Not now, Terry.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.837
We're having an argument
about who would win in a fight

00:11.881 --> 00:13.056
if we couldn't use our arms.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.840
- Everyone agrees,
I'd bite the best.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.277
- Meaningless!

00:16.320 --> 00:17.713
True strength comes
from the pelvis, not the mouth.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.062
- There's been
an assassination attempt!

00:19.106 --> 00:20.716
- What?

00:20.759 --> 00:22.065
And you let us just sit around
talking about Boyle's pelvis?

00:22.109 --> 00:23.980
- I didn't let you!

00:24.024 --> 00:25.895
Councilman Bosworth was giving
a speech at Garfield Plaza.

00:25.938 --> 00:26.896
He was shot in the shoulder.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.419
Now, he's in stable condition,

00:28.463 --> 00:29.725
but the shooter's
still at large!

00:29.768 --> 00:31.205
We have to move!

00:31.248 --> 00:32.858
We're locking down a ten-block
radius around the scene.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.077
No traffic in or out.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.296
We think our man
is still inside the area.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.037
ESU is on-site.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.690
I'll be leading the op
from a mobile command center.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.692
Santiago is running
perimeter control.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.043
Peralta, you're in charge
of the manhunt for the shooter.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.045
- Oh, my God, it's a manhunt.

00:45.088 --> 00:47.003
And I'm the Manhunter.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.527
- And I'm your sidekick,
the Boyhunter.

00:49.571 --> 00:50.876
- Come on, dude.
- I'm gonna be on the news.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.574
I'm gonna look straight
into the camera and say,

00:52.617 --> 00:54.706
"If the shooter is watching,
I hope you like living

00:54.750 --> 00:57.535
between St. Charles Place
and Connecticut Ave."

00:58.797 --> 01:00.103
- I don't get it.
- It's from "Monopoly."

01:00.147 --> 01:01.974
That's where jail is.

01:02.018 --> 01:04.629
Whatever, it was a good line.
Keep briefing!

01:04.673 --> 01:05.848
- Diaz, Santiago,

01:05.891 --> 01:07.284
the Command Tent's
on the northeast corner.

01:07.328 --> 01:08.416
We need to work fast.

01:08.459 --> 01:10.113
The mayor's only given us
five hours

01:10.157 --> 01:11.245
until the barricades
are lifted.

01:11.288 --> 01:12.507
- Five hours?

01:12.550 --> 01:13.682
Tell him the Manhunter
only needs one.

01:13.725 --> 01:15.031
- Love that,
but I'm gonna keep it at five.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.293
It's already way
too little time.

01:16.337 --> 01:17.729
All right,
I'm seeing security cameras.

01:17.773 --> 01:18.991
I need all that footage.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.819
I need forensics
to run a full sweep of--

01:20.863 --> 01:22.908
hey, what are all these
civilians doing here?

01:22.952 --> 01:25.259
Who's responsible for securing
the area, who screwed this up?

01:25.302 --> 01:27.435
- Hi, I'm Officer Debbie Fogle.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.524
I'm so sorry,
my partner's on crowd control.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.003
I don't know where he went.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.309
It's his first week on the job,

01:32.353 --> 01:33.528
so he's still
learning the ropes.

01:33.571 --> 01:34.659
- All right, listen, Fogle.

01:34.703 --> 01:35.747
We have a councilman
in the hospital

01:35.791 --> 01:37.140
and his shooter
is still at large.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.620
We don't have time
for this incompetence.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.230
I want your partner
off the case, what's his name?

01:40.274 --> 01:42.450
- It's Raymond Holt.

01:42.493 --> 01:43.494
- Oh!

01:43.538 --> 01:45.714
It's Dad--
I mean, Captain Holt!

01:45.757 --> 01:46.889
I mean, Captain Dad.

01:46.932 --> 01:47.933
I mean, Officer Holt.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.152
I mean, Officer Dad.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.762
Yep, that was it.
Officer Dad, I found it.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.958
- Detective, I thought
I saw a clue on the sidewalk.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.656
I apologize for not
properly securing the scene.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.701
- No need to apologize,
I wasn't even that mad.

02:16.745 --> 02:17.963
- You said you wanted
whoever messed up off the case.

02:18.007 --> 02:19.487
- It doesn't matter.

02:19.530 --> 02:20.662
The point is, no one
needs to get in trouble.

02:20.705 --> 02:22.098
- Look,
you don't have to pity me

02:22.142 --> 02:23.752
just because Madeline Wuntch
demoted me for a year.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.232
I've been stripped
of my accomplishments

02:25.275 --> 02:27.799
and lost the respect
of everyone in my life...

02:27.843 --> 02:28.844
including my dog.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.150
- Cheddar?
No.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.977
- Yes!
Now...

02:32.021 --> 02:32.978
he only poops for Kevin.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.284
- Oh, sir.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.633
- We don't have time
to take all this in,

02:35.677 --> 02:37.026
there's a shooter on the loose!

02:37.069 --> 02:38.288
Are you guys gonna be okay
working together or not?

02:38.332 --> 02:39.333
- Of course we will,

02:39.376 --> 02:40.377
I took an oath
to protect this city

02:40.421 --> 02:41.987
no matter what my rank.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.293
I have no problem

02:43.337 --> 02:44.642
with Detective Peralta
being my commander.

02:44.686 --> 02:45.774
- And I have no problem
commanding him.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.210
Here, watch this.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.342
Captain, will you please
lock down North 3rd Street,

02:48.385 --> 02:49.821
if that's okay with you,
Captain?

02:49.865 --> 02:50.953
- It certainly is!

02:52.041 --> 02:53.434
- Impressed?

02:53.477 --> 02:54.957
- You said "please" and you
called him "Captain" twice.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.393
- Yeah, we don't have time
for this, Lieutenant.

02:56.437 --> 02:57.481
There's a shooter
on the loose!

02:57.525 --> 02:59.135
- Traffic is shut down.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.789
Civilians are being funneled
into the checkpoints.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.225
- Good,
just wish my guys over here

03:02.269 --> 03:03.226
could be a little
more efficient.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.836
Yeah, I'm looking at you,

03:04.880 --> 03:06.273
Detective Fuzzy Paws!

03:06.316 --> 03:08.971
- Is this Amy-hates-dogs-Amy
or Amy-extra-stressed-Amy?

03:09.014 --> 03:10.929
- It's both Amys!
I'm under a lot of pressure.

03:10.973 --> 03:13.062
And also,
that dog is a piece of trash!

03:13.105 --> 03:14.150
- Okay.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.412
I can tell
something else is going on,

03:15.456 --> 03:16.674
you don't have to pretend
to be mad at the dog.

03:16.718 --> 03:17.806
- First of all,
I'm not pretending.

03:17.849 --> 03:18.937
That dog sucks!

03:18.981 --> 03:21.244
Also...

03:21.288 --> 03:22.898
My period's late,
I think I might be pregnant.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.856
- Oh, damn.
- I can't be pregnant!

03:24.900 --> 03:26.249
Jake and I agreed to wait
at least a year until we tried.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.424
I haven't found an OB,

03:27.468 --> 03:28.947
I'm not on any preschool
waiting lists,

03:28.991 --> 03:30.384
and I spent all of yesterday

03:30.427 --> 03:31.907
in a room with Hitchcock
and his new cologne,

03:31.950 --> 03:33.213
which can't be good
for the baby--

03:33.256 --> 03:34.562
it is literally called

03:34.605 --> 03:35.345
Zika!

03:35.389 --> 03:36.738
- Okay, relax,

03:36.781 --> 03:38.783
You're probably not pregnant,
it's entirely possible

03:38.827 --> 03:40.350
Hitchcock's cologne
disrupted your cycle.

03:40.394 --> 03:41.830
- Right, yes.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.962
That is a very real
possibility.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.529
- Santiago!
- Ah!

03:45.573 --> 03:46.835
- What's going on here?
Is everything okay?

03:46.878 --> 03:47.792
- Yeah, totes!

03:47.836 --> 03:48.924
Right, Rosa?

03:48.967 --> 03:50.534
- Uh, totes.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.275
- Why is everyone
being all weird today?

03:52.319 --> 03:53.885
Just get back to work
and be normal.

03:53.929 --> 03:56.105
- Yes, sir!
Will do, we'll be normal.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.281
Nothing to stress about here.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.717
Hey, Fuzzy Paws!

03:59.761 --> 04:01.545
I'm paying you to work,
not lick your butthole!

04:01.589 --> 04:03.460
- Yeah, I'm gonna get you
a pregnancy test.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.769
- Okay, I know you haven't
done this in a while,

04:07.812 --> 04:09.771
so here's a tip--
keep your hat on.

04:09.814 --> 04:11.947
Because of all
the standing still,

04:11.990 --> 04:13.644
the pigeons think we're statues

04:13.688 --> 04:16.081
and they will poop on you
or peck you.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.431
Both are bad.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.259
- Thank you
for the helpful tip.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.564
- Oh, I've got a ton of them.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.740
They're mostly about
the dangers of standing.

04:22.784 --> 04:25.090
A year on the beat
without prescription insoles

04:25.134 --> 04:26.918
can take two years
off your life.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.355
- Any way to speed
the process up?

04:30.313 --> 04:33.403
Okay, I've got
a funny guy for a partner.

04:33.447 --> 04:36.406
But seriously, you have to
monitor your foot health.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.539
I'll gonna send you
a pedometer app that I use.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.324
You're gonna love it.
It has robust social features.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.195
We can give each
other "foot-fives"!

04:43.239 --> 04:44.327
- No, thank you,

04:44.371 --> 04:45.546
I keep count of my steps
in my head,

04:45.589 --> 04:46.634
like a normal person.

04:46.677 --> 04:49.332
I'm up to 6,743 for the day.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.815
- Okay Boyle, it's time
for the Manhunter

04:53.858 --> 04:56.426
to hunt... man.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.341
- ♪ Ooh, here he comes

04:58.385 --> 05:00.648
♪ Watch out, men,
he'll hunt you down ♪

05:00.691 --> 05:02.432
♪ Ooh, here he comes

05:02.476 --> 05:04.086
♪ Jake's a manhunter!

05:04.129 --> 05:05.957
- Charles--
I love that.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.437
Keep doing the song
while I work the scene.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.917
- You got it!

05:10.397 --> 05:11.528
- Okay, bullet lodged there

05:11.572 --> 05:12.790
is 4 feet
below the hole in the backdrop

05:12.834 --> 05:14.749
indicating a trajectory
of about 15 degrees,

05:14.792 --> 05:15.880
which means the shot was taken

05:15.924 --> 05:17.404
from either
the second or third floor

05:17.447 --> 05:18.622
of one of the buildings
across the plaza.

05:18.666 --> 05:19.797
- ♪ Ooh, here he comes

05:19.841 --> 05:21.495
- That building's windows
don't open.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.279
- ♪ Watch out men,
he'll hunt you down ♪

05:23.323 --> 05:24.672
- That one's obscured by trees.
- ♪ Ooh, here he comes

05:24.715 --> 05:26.108
- Which means that the shooter
must've been located--

05:26.151 --> 05:27.370
- On the sky bridge.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.285
- ♪ Jake's a manhunter

05:29.329 --> 05:30.373
- Officer Holt.
- Mm.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.375
- I thought I stationed you...

05:32.419 --> 05:33.768
not here!

05:33.811 --> 05:34.725
- Right.

05:34.769 --> 05:35.900
I'm just here in the plaza

05:35.944 --> 05:37.815
looking for, um...

05:37.859 --> 05:39.251
this!

05:39.295 --> 05:40.470
- A half-eaten box
of McNuggets?

05:40.514 --> 05:41.906
- Yup, it's my lunch.
- Uh-huh.

05:41.950 --> 05:44.126
And what type of food
is a McNugget?

05:44.169 --> 05:46.694
- Some type of a...
paella?

05:46.737 --> 05:48.348
- You had to know
that was a bad guess.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.393
- Well, the point is,
I needed my paella

05:50.437 --> 05:51.481
and I noticed the sky bridge,

05:51.525 --> 05:52.961
so I thought I might
be of some help,

05:53.004 --> 05:54.484
but I'll just go back

05:54.528 --> 05:56.051
and stand next
to a piece of police tape

05:56.094 --> 05:58.053
and do nothing.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.402
- Wait, stop.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.621
How would you like
to stick around

06:00.664 --> 06:02.144
and assist on the case?

06:02.187 --> 06:03.275
- You sure, Jake, I mean,

06:03.319 --> 06:04.799
there's only room
for one Manhunter.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.235
- Boyle is right,
I don't want to overstep.

06:06.278 --> 06:07.584
- You're not overstepping.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.238
- I mean, he interrupted
the song, but whatever.

06:09.281 --> 06:10.413
- Great,
I'll just leave my paella

06:10.457 --> 06:11.980
on the ground,
save it for later.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.808
- We all know
that's not your lunch!

06:13.851 --> 06:16.027
So, the shooter
was standing right here.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.768
A standard long gun
would've ejected the casing

06:17.812 --> 06:19.466
right over...

06:19.509 --> 06:21.076
there, where Holt
is already putting down

06:21.119 --> 06:22.425
an evidence marker.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.079
- Yes, I found it
quite quickly.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.820
- Great, thank you for saving
me the trouble of doing my job.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.299
- Oh, sorry.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.084
Would you like me to pick
the evidence marker back up

06:29.127 --> 06:30.390
so you can place it
on the ground?

06:30.433 --> 06:31.913
- Yes!
- No, of course not.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.088
Good work.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.829
both: I bet the shooter
went that way.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.571
- Sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.399
both: Follow me
to the service entrance.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.879
- Ugh, we did it again.
I'm so sorry.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.490
- It's really no problem.
- Great!

06:43.533 --> 06:44.926
Follow me, everyone!

06:44.969 --> 06:46.667
- Wait, what?

06:46.710 --> 06:48.103
- Security footage showed
no cars leaving the area,

06:48.146 --> 06:49.800
so our shooter
must've left here on foot.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.019
- He's taking over
your case, Jake.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.412
You have to stop him.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.065
- Well, you know,
it takes a true leader

06:54.109 --> 06:55.502
to let someone else lead.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.939
- Ugh, sounds exactly
like something I would say.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.201
Snap out of it.

06:59.244 --> 07:00.202
- Look, it's fine, I just--

07:00.245 --> 07:01.638
I feel sorry for him, okay?

07:01.682 --> 07:03.423
His assignment was
standing next to tape.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.554
I'm still gonna crack the case.

07:04.598 --> 07:05.903
- I cracked the case.
- Come on!

07:05.947 --> 07:08.036
- Hot dog man,
tell them what you told me.

07:08.079 --> 07:09.994
- I saw a guy,
mid-height, brown hair,

07:10.038 --> 07:11.866
and a green hoodie
with an owl on it.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.389
He had a big bag
and he was running like hell.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.956
- It sounds like our guy.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.261
All right, let's call it in to
give a statement to the press.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.524
- Great idea.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.353
- He knows that I meant I would
give the statement, right?

07:21.397 --> 07:22.659
- And if the shooter's
watching,

07:22.703 --> 07:24.052
I hope you like living

07:24.095 --> 07:27.577
between St. Charles Place
and Connecticut Avenue.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.623
- Because that's where jail is
in "Monopoly."

07:29.666 --> 07:32.495
A great line from a great man,
or should I say,

07:32.539 --> 07:33.757
Manhunter.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.455
- Yeah, he overstepped.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.373
- Boyle, gather everyone up.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.505
- Oh, we starting a burn book
about Holt?

07:42.549 --> 07:43.506
Let's drag him, baby!

07:43.550 --> 07:45.073
- No, someone saw
our hoodie guy.

07:45.116 --> 07:46.422
- Right,
we'll do the burn book later.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.641
- Attention, everyone,
we have a possible sighting

07:47.684 --> 07:48.990
of our shooter on Hoyt Street.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.165
Detective Boyle and I
will take Alpha unit.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.383
Smith, Fox--
- You guard the burn book.

07:51.427 --> 07:52.646
- Charles, no.
- Stand down.

07:52.689 --> 07:53.821
- You take Bravo unit.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.126
The rest of you,
continue to sweep the area

07:55.170 --> 07:56.432
in case this lead
doesn't pan out.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.999
The clock is ticking,
go, go, go!

07:58.042 --> 08:00.218
- Where should I go, Detective?
I'd love to be of service.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.525
- Captain Holt!
I mean... dude!

08:02.569 --> 08:04.266
I haven't seen you since
your big news conference

08:04.309 --> 08:05.528
which I just loved.

08:05.572 --> 08:06.703
- Ray, there you are!

08:06.747 --> 08:08.357
I can't believe
you left your post again.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.099
Detectives, I'm sorry for
my partner's bad boy behavior.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.753
- I am not a bad boy,

08:12.796 --> 08:14.624
I'm trying to catch bad boys!

08:14.668 --> 08:16.539
If anything, I'm a good boy.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.585
- That's exactly
what a bad boy would say.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.674
- It's definitely not,
and no need to apologize,

08:20.717 --> 08:21.762
we have a job to do.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.285
- Great!
Where do you want us?

08:23.328 --> 08:24.460
- Someone matching
our shooter's profile

08:24.504 --> 08:25.940
was just seen
over on Atlantic and 4th,

08:25.983 --> 08:27.637
I need you both there
immediately, can you handle it?

08:27.681 --> 08:28.943
- Absolutely not,

08:28.986 --> 08:30.118
it sounds like
way too much responsibility.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.772
- Don't listen to Debbie.
We're on it!

08:31.815 --> 08:33.687
- All right.
Bye!

08:33.730 --> 08:35.558
- What's going on?
The guy's on Hoyt Street.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.299
- I know, I gave Holt
a fake lead to get rid of him.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.996
Don't worry, I'm still...

08:39.040 --> 08:40.084
the Manhunter.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.564
- ♪ He's the Manhunter!

08:41.608 --> 08:43.174
♪ And the boy
who he hunts with ♪

08:43.218 --> 08:44.306
- What's that song?
- The Boyhunter song!

08:44.349 --> 08:45.307
♪ Boyhunter

08:45.350 --> 08:46.830
♪ Down by the schoolyard

08:46.874 --> 08:48.223
- Why is he by the schoolyard?

08:48.266 --> 08:49.572
- He's gotta protect the kids!
- Sounds terrible.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.139
- Really, I don't hear it!
- Let's just go.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.097
- Okay, good news.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.316
I found a bodega
in the containment zone

08:54.359 --> 08:55.665
and got a bunch
of pregnancy tests.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.232
- A bunch?
- Yeah.

08:57.275 --> 08:58.625
It's a New York bodega,
you can't be too cautious.

08:58.668 --> 09:01.192
- Good point.
Yep, expired ten years ago.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.280
- Open.
And used!

09:02.324 --> 09:03.673
- Made of gummies?
Why?

09:03.717 --> 09:04.979
- Weirdly vibrating.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.241
- This is for teens.
That's dark.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.112
- This is good.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.505
- Great, let's do this.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.333
- Hey, Santiago,
nice work at checkpoint one.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.161
Wait, why are you guys
being all weird again?

09:13.204 --> 09:14.205
- We're not being weird.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.555
- Do not dab!

09:15.598 --> 09:17.078
- I wasn't going to.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.340
- I know what's going on here.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.168
- You do?
- Yep.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.604
You're talking about me.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.650
I know 'cause my daughters
are doing the same thing.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.739
Every time I go in that room,
they get all weird and quiet.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.218
That's 'cause
they're making fun of Daddy.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.959
Is that what you're doing,
making fun of Daddy?

09:29.003 --> 09:30.178
- First off--

09:30.221 --> 09:31.571
- Yeah, I heard it, I'm sorry.
- Great.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.094
Secondly,
we're not talking about you.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.617
- What are you
talking about, then?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.445
- Our favorite...

09:36.488 --> 09:37.359
porns.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.490
- What?
- It's true.

09:38.534 --> 09:39.753
We have specific
favorite porns.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.363
And we're talking about 'em.

09:41.406 --> 09:42.538
Yeah.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.583
- Okay, legally,

09:43.626 --> 09:45.193
I feel as though
I need to back away.

09:45.236 --> 09:48.022
But I want it to be known that
I still do not believe you.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.197
Get back to work!

09:49.240 --> 09:50.633
- Eh, that went well.
All right.

09:50.677 --> 09:51.982
Let's take this thing
and get it over with.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.505
- I can't.
- What? Why?

09:53.549 --> 09:55.638
- I have no pee inside of me.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.857
I'm pee-free, Rosa!

09:56.900 --> 09:58.859
What do I do, what do I do?

09:58.902 --> 10:00.208
- Drink water.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.513
- Oh, yeah.
You're smart.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.124
You're a very good friend,
I'm glad you're here.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.343
- Street's clear.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.997
No sign of the shooter,
where'd he go?

10:07.041 --> 10:09.043
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Why are you shushing me?

10:09.086 --> 10:10.348
- I'm doing that thing
where I listen

10:10.392 --> 10:11.523
really closely
for a noise clue,

10:11.567 --> 10:13.003
like glass breaking
or trash rustling.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.657
- Cool!
Is it working?

10:14.701 --> 10:16.224
- No, not yet.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.573
- Because I'm talking?
- Well, it's not helping.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.140
- Right, right, right.
I'll be quiet.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.489
- You don't have to say
you'll be quiet, just be quiet.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.360
- Okay.
I'm sorry for not being quiet.

10:22.404 --> 10:23.666
- Once again,
don't have to say.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.233
- Just wanna be clear
what I'm doing.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.408
- Understood.
I'm just gonna listen.

10:26.451 --> 10:29.367
- Okay.
I'll be very quiet.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.282
- Don't have to say it.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.675
- Just wanna make sure
you know what I'm doing.

10:32.719 --> 10:33.937
- Please stop.
- So I don't throw you.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.069
- Okay, stop talking.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.984
- I'll stop talking.
- Great.

10:37.027 --> 10:38.463
- I'll make sure
I don't do that again.

10:38.507 --> 10:39.943
- All right, Charles,
I love you, but you ruined it.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.207
both: Trash rustle!

10:43.251 --> 10:45.253
- He's running, call it in!

10:52.390 --> 10:54.305
I'll follow, you cut him off!

10:58.919 --> 11:00.224
Damn it!

11:02.139 --> 11:03.401
- Nice, Charles!

11:03.445 --> 11:04.925
- Name's not Charles,
it's...

11:04.968 --> 11:06.013
Boyhunter.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.014
- You know what, you earned it.

11:07.057 --> 11:08.929
Way to get your boy, Boyhunter!

11:08.972 --> 11:11.148
All right, let's get our perp
back to the Nine-Nine.

11:11.192 --> 11:12.846
I'll tell Jeffords
to lift the lockdown.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.282
- Detective Peralta!

11:14.325 --> 11:15.500
I see you got the man
you were looking for.

11:15.544 --> 11:16.676
- With your help, officer!

11:16.719 --> 11:18.112
I really couldn't have
done it without you.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.374
- No, this was all you.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.028
We were in a completely
wrong location.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.638
- Which was a huge relief
to me.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.032
Plus, we got a lot of steps in.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.686
I'm drowning in foot-fives.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.470
- Well, no need
to focus on who was where

11:28.513 --> 11:30.037
or what a foot-five is,

11:30.080 --> 11:31.734
we gotta start brainstorming
headlines for tomorrow's paper.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.127
- I got one.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.085
"The Only Assassin in this City
is Jake Peralta

11:35.129 --> 11:36.652
Because He Just Killed
This Case."

11:36.696 --> 11:37.871
- I don't know if we want
to make it seem

11:37.914 --> 11:38.959
like I'm the assassin.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.090
- Yeah, good thinking.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.396
- How about this,
"Hero Cop Saves City,

11:41.439 --> 11:43.180
"Pitt, Clooney Circling
To Play Him In Biopic."

11:43.224 --> 11:44.791
- Hunks!
- I have a headline.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.097
"Pitt, Clooney Laugh
At Jake Peralta

11:47.141 --> 11:48.664
For Arresting the Wrong Man."

11:48.708 --> 11:50.231
- Well, I don't know if they
would laugh at me for saving--

11:50.274 --> 11:51.536
what, did you just say
I got the wrong man?

11:55.758 --> 11:57.499
- What do you mean
we got the wrong man?

11:57.542 --> 11:58.761
What are you talking about?

11:58.805 --> 12:00.241
- You know how you sent
Debbie and me off

12:00.284 --> 12:01.329
on a wild goose chase?
- Oh, so you figured that out?

12:01.372 --> 12:02.634
- Well, Debbie did.
She's quite the detective.

12:02.678 --> 12:03.940
- Oh, I'm really not.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.289
I'm just always being given
meaningless tasks

12:05.333 --> 12:06.900
and I'm not complaining.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.858
- So what, you're just saying
we have the wrong guy now,

12:08.902 --> 12:10.686
because you're upset
about the fake lead?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.427
- No, I'm saying you have
the wrong guy because you do.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.777
When I realized your lead
was nothing but hooey,

12:14.821 --> 12:17.693
I went back to re-interview the
hot dog man, but he was gone.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.477
And why was that?
Debbie, tell 'em!

12:19.521 --> 12:21.044
- Oh, no, I don't want
to be a part of this.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.959
- Because the hot dog man
is the shooter.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.787
- What?
That seems like a reach.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.224
- Sometimes, when you reach,
you grab the truth.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.660
- Sorry, Jake,
he turned it around on me.

12:28.704 --> 12:29.966
- Come on!

12:30.010 --> 12:31.315
- The hot dog man
gave a false statement

12:31.359 --> 12:32.621
to throw us off the scent
and then vanished

12:32.664 --> 12:34.449
while we were off
looking for the wrong guy.

12:34.492 --> 12:35.711
Face it, you're no Manhunter.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.496
If anything,
you're a Wrong Manhunter.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.672
How dare you.

12:40.716 --> 12:42.022
You know what?
This is crazy.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.458
You're just making up a solve

12:43.501 --> 12:45.286
because you can't stand
the fact that you got demoted.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.678
You've been trying to hijack
this case all day.

12:46.722 --> 12:47.984
- I was only trying to help.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.159
If I'm such a headache,

12:49.203 --> 12:50.813
then why didn't
you reassign me?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.597
- Because I felt sorry for you.

12:52.641 --> 12:55.252
- I told you to treat me
like any uniformed officer.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.514
It's not my fault

12:56.558 --> 12:57.689
that you don't know
how to give an order!

12:57.733 --> 12:58.952
- Okay, fine.
Here's one.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.867
We're lifting the lockdown,
go pick up cones.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.520
- Ooh, I love cone duty!
- Debbie, can it!

13:02.564 --> 13:03.957
We have the wrong guy.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.132
You cannot lift the lockdown.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.524
- Go pick up cones,
that's an order.

13:06.568 --> 13:07.699
- No!

13:07.743 --> 13:09.136
- Fine,
then you're off the case!

13:09.179 --> 13:10.790
- Good.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.272
- Do I still get to
pick up cones?

13:15.316 --> 13:17.013
both: No!

13:17.057 --> 13:19.102
- Amy, stop.
You've had enough water.

13:19.146 --> 13:20.538
I can hear it sloshing around
inside you.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.671
- I know,
but I still can't pee!

13:22.714 --> 13:23.759
I'm too stressed.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.804
- You need to calm down.

13:24.847 --> 13:25.848
You know what helps me relax?

13:25.892 --> 13:27.110
- Kicking stuff?
- Absolutely.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.851
So, what or who
do you wanna kick?

13:28.895 --> 13:30.635
That guy looks pretty kickable.
Hey!

13:30.679 --> 13:32.202
- I'm not kicking anybody,
okay?

13:32.246 --> 13:34.726
I just need, like,
some calming noises.

13:34.770 --> 13:35.684
- Okay, close your eyes.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.381
- Okay.

13:37.425 --> 13:39.731
- Glub, glub, glub.

13:39.775 --> 13:40.732
- What is that?

13:40.776 --> 13:41.864
- It's a babbling brook.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.562
Glub, glub, glub.

13:44.606 --> 13:45.781
- You know what?
It's pretty good.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.436
- Thank you.
Everybody, shut up!

13:48.479 --> 13:52.005
Glub, glub, glub,
glub, glub, glub.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.659
- Why is the tent so quiet?

13:54.703 --> 13:56.574
Is everybody
talking about me now?

13:56.618 --> 13:57.880
- Nobody is talking about you.

13:57.924 --> 13:58.881
- Sure.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.404
Terry walks into a tent

14:00.448 --> 14:03.059
and everybody just happens
to stop talking

14:03.103 --> 14:05.061
at the same damn time?

14:05.105 --> 14:07.803
You are gaslighting me
just like my daughters!

14:07.847 --> 14:09.457
- Terry, I think
you're being paranoid.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.675
- I'm not paranoid!

14:10.719 --> 14:12.895
I put a recording device
in my girls' room.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.549
- You planted a bug
in your daughters' room?

14:14.592 --> 14:15.985
- I do what I have to do.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.900
They said I look like
a giant triangle!

14:17.944 --> 14:19.075
- Is that an insult?
- I don't know!

14:19.119 --> 14:20.511
But they were laughing
like it was,

14:20.555 --> 14:22.644
and it hurt just the same!

14:22.687 --> 14:24.951
Don't have kids!

14:26.953 --> 14:28.911
- Well, that ruined everything.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.565
- I know we got
kicked off the case,

14:30.608 --> 14:32.262
but there is good news.

14:32.306 --> 14:35.613
I unlocked a new accessory
for my Foot Friend avatar:

14:35.657 --> 14:36.701
a sandal!

14:36.745 --> 14:37.964
- Debbie, wait.
Change of plans.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.791
We're not going back
to the precinct.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.576
- Are we gonna go rogue
and pick up cones?

14:41.619 --> 14:44.318
- Oh, we're going way more
rogue than picking up cones.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.015
Listen,
it's unlikely our shooter

14:46.059 --> 14:47.843
had his own hot dog cart--
where'd he get it from?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.105
- Please don't make me
help you with this.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.977
- My guess is
the food cart garage

14:51.020 --> 14:52.935
just two blocks away
from our crime scene,

14:52.979 --> 14:56.156
or, shall I say, 238 steps.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.898
- Don't tempt me with steps.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.638
- This is a defining moment
for you.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.250
You can either obey orders
for the rest of your life

15:03.293 --> 15:07.167
and make no impact
on the world, or stand up!

15:07.210 --> 15:09.169
And solve this case with me.

15:10.518 --> 15:11.780
- Is there a third option?

15:11.823 --> 15:13.129
- Nervously tag along.
- Great.

15:13.173 --> 15:16.132
I choose
the nervously tag along option.

15:16.176 --> 15:18.352
- Okay, the reporters are all
set for your press conference.

15:18.395 --> 15:20.484
It's your big moment,
are you excited?

15:20.528 --> 15:21.659
- No.
- Oh.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.009
Are you worried
about your voice cracking?

15:23.052 --> 15:24.358
Do you want me to help you
warm up your throat?

15:24.401 --> 15:25.620
- What would that entail?
- I'll just show you.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.056
- Don't show me, tell me.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.623
- I blow hot air into my hands
and I stroke your neck.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.059
- That's not gonna happen,
and it's not why I'm stressed.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.365
I think Holt got into my head.

15:31.408 --> 15:32.975
We might have to delay
the press conference.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.237
- But this is the moment
we've been waiting for.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.456
My dad's driving home early

15:35.499 --> 15:37.588
from his brother's funeral
to watch it live.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.068
- Wait, he's doing what?

15:39.112 --> 15:40.635
- If you want me to put it
in a better context, I can't.

15:40.678 --> 15:41.941
This was very important to him.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.551
- Holt is a great cop,

15:43.594 --> 15:45.118
and I know the demotion's
driving him crazy,

15:45.161 --> 15:47.120
but his gut is usually right.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.860
I think we need to find
that hot dog cart guy.

15:48.904 --> 15:49.992
- Okay, fine.

15:50.036 --> 15:50.993
But who do we know
that could find us

15:51.037 --> 15:52.690
a random New York hot dog guy?

15:54.866 --> 15:55.998
- ♪ Hey

15:57.782 --> 15:58.740
♪ Hey!

16:00.046 --> 16:01.047
♪ Hey!

16:02.787 --> 16:05.094
- So, you need a little help
from the Weiner Warriors.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.313
- Well, I hate that.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.141
Just tell us what you know,
please?

16:08.184 --> 16:09.751
- There's Lou's Dogs,
he serves 'em up real plump.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.187
- Big Mike's does
two dogs per bun.

16:11.231 --> 16:12.841
- Hank's Franks--
great mustard selection.

16:12.884 --> 16:13.885
- Vicki's Vegan?

16:13.929 --> 16:15.539
I'd rather eat .

16:15.583 --> 16:17.628
- Charlie does an al dente dog,
it's got a really nice chew.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.326
- Johnny Arkansas serves it
Little Rock style,

16:19.369 --> 16:20.892
although he can serve it
Razorback-style.

16:20.936 --> 16:21.893
- Okay, enough, enough!

16:21.937 --> 16:23.112
We don't have time for this!

16:23.156 --> 16:25.201
Just tell us who has a cart
at 6th and 11th.

16:25.245 --> 16:26.072
- Oh, there are no
hot dog carts there.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.638
- What?
Never?

16:27.682 --> 16:28.988
- No way.
- Not a chance!

16:29.031 --> 16:30.554
- Zoning issue.
Forget about it, Jake.

16:30.598 --> 16:31.642
It's Hungertown.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.470
- Oh my God, Holt was right.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.516
We have to call him.

16:35.559 --> 16:36.386
Officer Holt?

16:36.430 --> 16:38.040
Officer Holt, do you copy?

16:38.084 --> 16:39.650
- Okay, cop.
Turn it off.

16:39.694 --> 16:40.825
- Nice try.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.436
My partner doesn't
follow orders.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.786
- Debbie, you're misreading
the situation.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.092
- Oh.
I'm so sorry.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.658
We both--
both follow orders.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.751
- So you were the shooter,
just like I said.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.275
And the man in the hoodie

16:55.318 --> 16:57.277
was just some random bystander
on whom you tried to pin it!

16:57.320 --> 16:59.061
- No, he was in on it too.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.236
- Oh.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.716
Well, I'm still half right.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.370
- Sure.
Is that important to you?

17:03.413 --> 17:04.675
- Very.
- I'm gonna die.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.155
I'm gonna die before
I ever got to find

17:06.199 --> 17:07.330
my twin sister's killer.

17:07.374 --> 17:08.810
- What?

17:08.853 --> 17:10.159
- That's the reason
I joined the force, remember?

17:10.203 --> 17:12.161
To find the man
who murdered my twin sister.

17:12.205 --> 17:13.554
That's my whole story!

17:13.597 --> 17:16.035
- Debbie, there's no way
you told me that.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.211
Nothing's working!

17:18.254 --> 17:19.864
- Maybe you just need to laugh.

17:19.908 --> 17:23.259
Here, look at this video of a
man being trampled by a moose.

17:25.348 --> 17:26.915
- Dear Lord, that's horrifying!

17:26.958 --> 17:28.743
I know, it's hilarious.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.658
- What are you laughing at?
Is that a video of me?

17:30.701 --> 17:31.702
Oh, no, is it that time

17:31.746 --> 17:33.443
Terry fell off a Lime scooter?

17:33.487 --> 17:34.662
- Why would any of us
have that footage?

17:34.705 --> 17:36.185
- Don't skirt the question!

17:36.229 --> 17:37.534
I want to know what I'm
falling off of in that video.

17:37.578 --> 17:38.753
- Stop it, Terry, okay?

17:38.796 --> 17:40.798
We haven't been
talking about you!

17:40.842 --> 17:43.453
Oh. Kicking.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.672
I think kicking's working.

17:44.715 --> 17:45.629
- Told you.
Go with it.

17:45.673 --> 17:46.978
Keep kicking that can.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.766
It worked, I have to pee!
I finally have to pee!

17:51.809 --> 17:53.333
- Wait, this is about you
having to pee?

17:53.376 --> 17:55.074
both: Yes!
- Wow.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.771
I guess I owe you guys
an apology.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.251
I may have been bringing
some things from home

17:58.294 --> 17:59.730
into the workplace.

17:59.774 --> 18:00.905
- Yeah, that was clear
from the start, okay?

18:00.949 --> 18:02.342
Now, move,
I need to find a bathroom.

18:02.385 --> 18:03.604
- Stop, we have an emergency!

18:03.647 --> 18:04.779
Everybody stop
what you're about to do.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.302
- Yeah, but I gotta pee
really bad.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.130
- Well, hold it, Amy.
Holt's not answering his radio.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.392
I think he and Debbie
might be in trouble.

18:09.436 --> 18:10.654
- It's just us, man,
you don't have to pretend

18:10.698 --> 18:12.134
to care about Debbie.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.222
- Rosa!
- What?

18:13.266 --> 18:14.702
We barely know her
and she's annoying.

18:14.745 --> 18:15.877
She's always trying to get
people to be friends with her

18:15.920 --> 18:17.139
on that weird app
for pedicures.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.098
- It's a pedometer app.
It's a pedometer app!

18:19.141 --> 18:21.448
We can use the social features
to track her!

18:21.491 --> 18:22.623
It's $80.

18:22.666 --> 18:23.624
Uh, Boyle,
you should download it,

18:23.667 --> 18:24.842
you get better service here.

18:24.886 --> 18:25.843
- Smart!

18:25.887 --> 18:27.454
And I'll upgrade
to ad-free too.

18:27.497 --> 18:28.803
- Smart.
- Okay, let's move!

18:28.846 --> 18:30.196
- Sweet!
We're running, okay.

18:30.239 --> 18:32.546
- If I die,
will you look after my cat?

18:32.589 --> 18:34.330
- I'm really more
of a dog person.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.331
- I understand.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.204
- NYPD, nobody move!
- You're surrounded!

18:38.247 --> 18:39.596
Don't do anything stupid.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.163
- Looks like we got
ourselves a standoff.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.643
- Fine by us, we got
all the time in the world.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.166
- What?
Uh-uh!

18:44.210 --> 18:45.254
I gotta pee!

18:48.257 --> 18:49.302
- Perp secured.

18:49.345 --> 18:50.868
- Great, okay, cool!

18:50.912 --> 18:52.305
I gotta go!
You guys are good, right?

18:52.348 --> 18:54.002
Bye!

18:54.045 --> 18:55.438
- Thanks for saving us,
Peralta.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.745
- Thank Debbie, we tracked you
using her pedometer app.

18:57.788 --> 19:00.661
- Oh, my goodness, I helped!

19:00.704 --> 19:03.316
And I got four new
Foot Friend requests!

19:03.359 --> 19:06.057
What a day, guys!

19:07.233 --> 19:08.495
- Detective.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.279
I believe I owe you an apology.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.325
- No, Officer, I owe you one.

19:12.368 --> 19:13.717
- No, I owe you.

19:13.761 --> 19:14.849
- Great, 'cause I hadn't
thought of

19:14.892 --> 19:16.198
what I was gonna
apologize for yet.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.982
- I should not have
disobeyed your order.

19:18.026 --> 19:18.853
I was wrong.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.202
Not about the case, of course,

19:20.246 --> 19:21.334
my hunch was impeccable.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.509
- Interesting apology strategy,

19:22.552 --> 19:23.510
a little heavy on the brags.

19:23.553 --> 19:24.946
- Point is, you were right.

19:24.989 --> 19:29.385
I hijacked the case because
I need to feel respected.

19:29.429 --> 19:30.647
Listen,

19:30.691 --> 19:32.301
it's weird
that I'm your boss now,

19:32.345 --> 19:33.607
and that's not going anywhere,

19:33.650 --> 19:36.000
but no matter
what uniform you wear,

19:36.044 --> 19:37.393
I'm always gonna love you--

19:37.437 --> 19:38.351
I mean, cherish--

19:38.394 --> 19:39.439
I mean, respect.

19:39.482 --> 19:40.614
You said respect, right?
- Yes.

19:40.657 --> 19:41.789
- Yep.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.138
- And I feel the same
about you.

19:44.748 --> 19:47.490
So, do you have
any orders for me, sir?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.536
- Well, I do actually

19:49.579 --> 19:51.625
still need those cones
picked up.

19:51.668 --> 19:52.756
- We're on it.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.062
- We got cone duty?

19:54.105 --> 19:55.194
Yes!

19:55.237 --> 19:56.760
Best birthday yet.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.806
- It's your birthday?

19:58.849 --> 20:01.243
- Hey, so...

20:01.287 --> 20:03.114
today was pretty intense.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.812
- You mean
catching the shooter?

20:04.855 --> 20:06.248
I know, it's a great story.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.597
I just hope Pitt
can get in good enough shape

20:07.641 --> 20:08.555
to play me in the movie,
you know?

20:08.598 --> 20:09.904
- Mm, yeah.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.820
Um, also,
something else happened.

20:12.863 --> 20:15.214
I thought I might be pregnant.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.824
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.129
I'm not, I got my period.

20:18.173 --> 20:19.870
And I took a pregnancy test,
but it didn't work

20:19.914 --> 20:21.089
because I drank
11 gallons of water.

20:21.132 --> 20:22.917
- Told you
water was bad for you.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.614
- That's not the takeaway.
- You're absolutely right.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.486
How are you, how do you feel?
Are you okay?

20:26.529 --> 20:28.531
- I mean,
I was really stressed.

20:28.575 --> 20:32.231
This wasn't our plan,
and we agreed we'd wait a year

20:32.274 --> 20:34.058
and there's so much
to do first,

20:34.102 --> 20:36.278
and it would've been crazy,
right?

20:36.322 --> 20:37.584
- Yeah, it would've been.

20:37.627 --> 20:38.585
- Okay.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.326
- But...

20:40.369 --> 20:42.197
also might've been...

20:42.241 --> 20:43.677
kinda cool.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.418
- Honestly?

20:45.461 --> 20:48.159
I was secretly bummed when
the test came back negative.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.554
- Should we just start trying?

20:51.598 --> 20:54.165
- Seriously?

20:54.209 --> 20:56.603
- Yeah, seriously.

20:56.646 --> 20:59.562
- Okay.
Yeah.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.353
- Oh, wait!
It's after 11.

21:07.396 --> 21:08.441
- My interview!

21:08.484 --> 21:09.746
It's supposed to be
on the news.

21:09.790 --> 21:10.791
- An incredible conclusion

21:10.834 --> 21:11.922
to a terrifying day,

21:11.966 --> 21:13.707
and we were able
to get a comment

21:13.750 --> 21:15.317
from the men who helped
solve this case.

21:15.361 --> 21:18.189
- They call us
the Weiner Warriors.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.104
- No!

21:20.148 --> 21:22.237
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.195
- Fremulon.
