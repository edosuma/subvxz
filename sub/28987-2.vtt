he killed Terry.

31:24.067 --> 31:26.067
And why would you think that?

that me and Terry got married

39:00.800 --> 39:02.200
Amy obviously thought
that a wash

39:21.467 --> 39:23.333
Troy was wearing his pajamas,

39:23.333 --> 39:26.200
so she had to get him changed
back into his normal clothes.

She then lifted the DVD
from the CCTV system

39:30.933 --> 39:33.400

taking his pajamas with her.

Terry wasn't abusing Troy.

He was out of the country

were inflicted.

39:52.933 --> 39:55.400
ROB: I think what
really happened last night

39:55.400 --> 39:58.533
was that Terry took Troy
back to the pub,

39:58.533 --> 40:00.267
changed him into his pajamas.

40:01.033 --> 40:04.067
He discovered his injuries
like I did today,

40:04.067 --> 40:06.633
realized that Amy
had been hitting him,

40:06.633 --> 40:09.733
and I think that Terry
threatened to report the abuse.

40:11.467 --> 40:13.867
Threatening the relationship
between Troy and his mum.

40:16.167 --> 40:18.967
But how could a kid
the size of Troy

40:18.967 --> 40:20.867
wield enough power
to kill an adult?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.433
Grandad had a fight with a man.

40:28.433 --> 40:30.700
He took the baseball bat
off him.

40:32.967 --> 40:37.133
We know that Grandad hit the man
on the arm with the bat.

40:39.167 --> 40:41.133
And then the man ran off.

40:43.167 --> 40:44.833
Then what did you do?

40:44.833 --> 40:46.500
I picked up the bat.

40:49.167 --> 40:50.667
Your Grandad see you?

40:51.233 --> 40:52.833
I was behind him.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.600
Was he standing up?

40:57.300 --> 41:00.533
No, he was bent down.

Why was he bent down?

41:01.867 --> 41:04.700
He'd been cleaning his glasses.

41:04.700 --> 41:06.733
But he dropped them.

41:06.733 --> 41:08.767
He asked me to pick them up.

41:08.767 --> 41:09.867
I said no.

41:10.633 --> 41:11.500
Why?

41:11.500 --> 41:13.767
Because I was mad at him.

41:16.867 --> 41:17.800
What about?

41:17.800 --> 41:19.233
He was cross

41:19.233 --> 41:21.333
and telling me
to get dressed again.

41:21.333 --> 41:24.133
He said we were going back
to get all my stuff

41:24.133 --> 41:26.133
and that I was going
to live with him.

41:34.567 --> 41:35.967
Why did you hit him, Troy?

41:37.500 --> 41:39.333
He was going to split me up
from my mum.

41:41.133 --> 41:43.067
But your mum's been hurting you.

41:44.367 --> 41:45.933
I make her angry.

41:45.933 --> 41:47.467
It's my fault.

DAMON: No.

41:53.167 --> 41:54.433
It's not.

DAMON: Uh, sorry.

42:22.233 --> 42:24.233
What's gonna happen to him now?

42:25.467 --> 42:26.533
Um...

42:27.833 --> 42:32.133
Troy is under the age
of criminal responsibility.

42:33.067 --> 42:35.900
Which means he can't be arrested
or charged with a crime.

42:36.967 --> 42:39.233
ROB: But he could
be taken into care.

42:39.233 --> 42:42.833
Unless you step up and prove
that you can look after him.

42:42.833 --> 42:45.100
That's all I ever wanted.

42:47.667 --> 42:49.567
Amy wouldn't let me
anywhere near him.

43:09.067 --> 43:10.433
You were willing
to go down for murder

43:10.433 --> 43:12.533
rather than admit
to hitting your son?

[ Voice breaking ] You don't
know how hard it's been for me

43:18.733 --> 43:20.867

43:27.300 --> 43:29.867
Amy Fisher,
I'm further arresting you

43:29.867 --> 43:32.833
on suspicion of actual
bodily harm on Troy Fisher

43:32.833 --> 43:36.067
and attempting to pervert
the course of justice.

43:36.067 --> 43:38.300
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

43:38.300 --> 43:39.900
if you do not mention,
when questioned,

43:39.900 --> 43:41.667
something which you later
rely on in court.

43:41.667 --> 43:43.533
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

43:43.533 --> 43:45.233
Do you understand?

43:51.867 --> 43:53.433
Great instincts.
Well done.

43:53.433 --> 43:55.067
You're joking, ain't ya?

43:55.067 --> 43:57.100
I mean, the sarge had her
suspicions from the word "go."

43:58.067 --> 43:59.567
You should learn
to take a compliment.

43:59.567 --> 44:01.200
DAVID: She's right.

44:01.200 --> 44:04.567
Your child protection experience
is what turned the case around.

44:04.567 --> 44:06.067
Cheers, boss.

44:10.433 --> 44:12.433
You two best buddies again.

44:13.733 --> 44:14.800
Hardly.

He told me that he put

44:22.400 --> 44:24.567
the missing-persons inquiry
team straight.

44:25.567 --> 44:28.767
But what he doesn't know is
I've got a mate on that inquiry.

-Oh, don't tell me.

They still think that David
was with you that night.
