WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:03.502
NARRATOR: Shadowy
figures appear in the night,

00:03.653 --> 00:06.654
terrifying all
who encounter them.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.156
I don't even know
how to describe

00:08.175 --> 00:09.750
- that level of fear...
- (gasps)

00:09.902 --> 00:12.419
because it was this big,
hulking black mass.

00:12.571 --> 00:15.255
NARRATOR:
They paralyze their prey.

00:15.349 --> 00:18.350
It was like being chained
to the bottom of the ocean.

00:18.502 --> 00:21.261
You can't move,
you can't breathe.

00:21.413 --> 00:23.004
NARRATOR:
And according to some,

00:23.024 --> 00:27.084
they are not only frightening
but deadly.

00:27.102 --> 00:28.602
DAVID CHILDRESS:
They explained it as

00:28.754 --> 00:32.031
these shadow entities
were killing them.

00:32.182 --> 00:33.590
(sustained beep)

00:33.683 --> 00:35.092
NARRATOR:
Could dark entities

00:35.185 --> 00:37.277
known as the shadow people

00:37.429 --> 00:41.431
be more than just a product
of the imagination?

00:41.525 --> 00:44.526
Are there beings coming to Earth
from other worlds

00:44.545 --> 00:47.695
or other dimensions,
with malicious intentions

00:47.790 --> 00:49.548
for the human race?

00:49.699 --> 00:50.941
JONATHAN YOUNG:
It seems menacing,

00:50.959 --> 00:54.278
it seems from another place.

00:54.371 --> 00:56.446
It's a mystery,
but it's a mystery

00:56.540 --> 00:59.183
that a lot of people
are encountering.

01:02.454 --> 01:04.646
NARRATOR: There is a
doorway in the universe.

01:06.883 --> 01:09.651
Beyond it
is the promise of truth.

01:11.221 --> 01:13.630
It demands
we question everything

01:13.649 --> 01:15.890
we have ever been taught.

01:15.910 --> 01:19.469
The evidence is all around us.

01:19.488 --> 01:23.398
The future is right
before our eyes.

01:23.492 --> 01:26.234
We are not alone.

01:26.328 --> 01:29.421
We have never been alone.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.656
Vientiane, Laos.

01:39.675 --> 01:42.768
December 2, 1975.

01:44.012 --> 01:46.438
In the wake of the Vietnam War,

01:46.590 --> 01:50.091
the Hmong people,
a group of indigenous Laotians,

01:50.111 --> 01:52.352
are forced to flee their country

01:52.504 --> 01:55.672
as the Communist Party
seizes political control.

01:55.765 --> 01:58.266
Thousands of displaced
Hmong people

01:58.360 --> 02:00.619
immigrate to the United States.

02:00.770 --> 02:03.697
But as they become settled
in their new communities,

02:03.791 --> 02:07.709
they face an unexpected
and much more mysterious threat.

02:09.797 --> 02:14.024
There was a very strange rash
of deaths of Hmong men

02:14.117 --> 02:16.969
who suddenly died
in their sleep.

02:17.196 --> 02:20.046
And medical technicians
could find no reason

02:20.199 --> 02:23.383
for these strange deaths.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.886
If you look at the statistics,

02:25.980 --> 02:28.630
suddenly, when the Hmong people
arrived in the United States,

02:28.649 --> 02:33.134
their death rates skied. Why?

02:33.228 --> 02:35.879
Nobody knows why, because
they didn't have any symptoms.

02:35.898 --> 02:38.215
They just died.

02:38.233 --> 02:40.826
NARRATOR: After numerous
inconclusive autopsies,

02:40.977 --> 02:44.554
mystified doctors were unable
to find a cause of death

02:44.573 --> 02:47.724
but gave the phenomenon a name:

02:47.743 --> 02:51.503
"sudden unexpected
nocturnal death syndrome."

02:51.730 --> 02:56.157
All but one of the 117 men
who died were in good health,

02:56.177 --> 02:59.736
with a median age of 33.

02:59.755 --> 03:02.830
So, while some doctors
now speculate that the deaths

03:02.925 --> 03:07.019
might be explained by an obscure
genetic cardiac arrhythmia,

03:07.246 --> 03:11.839
the Hmong believe
there is another explanation.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.693
Modern medical science
could not explain these deaths.

03:16.255 --> 03:18.346
But among the Hmong,
they knew it was because

03:18.365 --> 03:22.016
they couldn't practice
their original religion.

03:22.036 --> 03:25.111
In Laos, there is a belief
that there are night spirits

03:25.206 --> 03:27.355
that are dangerous, but if you
have done your rituals,

03:27.374 --> 03:29.190
your prayers, your ceremonies,

03:29.284 --> 03:31.785
and have your ceremonial objects
near your bed, you're fine.

03:31.937 --> 03:34.195
It's all under control,
when you're in Laos.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.789
But when you're brought
to another country

03:35.941 --> 03:38.108
and you're working
odd shifts and things,

03:38.201 --> 03:40.201
maybe your rituals
get a little off.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.554
So you're in trouble
and the night spirits get you

03:42.706 --> 03:44.631
and you die,
which is just so strange.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.133
I mean, these are night spirits.
They're-- that's superstition,

03:47.228 --> 03:48.376
but they died.

03:48.470 --> 03:49.561
The deaths are real.

03:51.214 --> 03:52.731
NARRATOR:
These shadowy night spirits

03:52.958 --> 03:56.460
are known by the Hmong people
as "cho chua"

03:56.553 --> 03:59.071
and are often described
as "pressure demons."

03:59.222 --> 04:01.965
That is,
demons that exert pressure

04:02.058 --> 04:04.243
by sitting
on their victims' chests

04:04.470 --> 04:06.894
until they can
no longer breathe.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.489
The Hmong people talked about
some of the symptoms

04:09.583 --> 04:13.827
they experienced,
not just nightmares but visions,

04:13.979 --> 04:17.405
and a terrible pressure
on their bodies,

04:17.499 --> 04:21.760
because their ancestral spirits
were no longer protecting them.

04:21.987 --> 04:24.154
The Hmong themselves
explained it

04:24.172 --> 04:30.435
as these shadow entities
were killing and punishing them

04:30.662 --> 04:34.088
for not having done
their rituals correctly.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.850
HENRY: The reason why
we know that they believed

04:36.944 --> 04:39.611
they were dying from this
is because medical experts,

04:39.838 --> 04:41.113
researchers talked
with the family members

04:41.264 --> 04:43.282
and that's what they said.

04:44.843 --> 04:45.933
NARRATOR:
The Hmong people's description

04:46.028 --> 04:47.511
of their interaction

04:47.604 --> 04:49.679
with the pressure demons
known as cho chua

04:49.698 --> 04:51.698
bears a striking resemblance

04:51.850 --> 04:54.293
to what ancient astronaut
theorists describe

04:54.520 --> 04:58.297
as mysterious entities
called shadow people.

04:58.448 --> 05:00.357
An extraordinary experience
has been reported

05:00.450 --> 05:02.692
by thousands
of people worldwide.

05:02.786 --> 05:06.029
They're asleep,
suddenly they wake up,

05:06.048 --> 05:09.549
and there's this dark
humanoid figure that's opaque.

05:09.701 --> 05:12.369
It appears to be made
of some ethereal substance

05:12.387 --> 05:15.630
that reflects no light.

05:15.724 --> 05:19.467
MIKE RICKSECKER: Shadow
entities can be a lot of different things.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.712
But in general, what we see
with these shadow entities

05:22.731 --> 05:26.550
are some common traits,
such as no facial features.

05:26.568 --> 05:28.660
Everything is black
and dark in nature.

05:28.812 --> 05:31.479
Some may be very solid,
some may be very translucent,

05:31.498 --> 05:33.123
but we're not getting
any detail.

05:34.651 --> 05:36.501
NARRATOR:
Due to their shadowy nature,

05:36.728 --> 05:38.986
experiencers have difficulty
making sense

05:39.006 --> 05:42.082
of just what these entities are.

05:42.176 --> 05:47.095
But for most, the encounters
are terrifyingly real.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.758
Los Angeles, California.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.579
February 2011.

05:55.597 --> 05:58.023
On a quiet night,

05:58.250 --> 06:00.842
journalist Paul Christensen
is asleep in bed

06:00.861 --> 06:04.087
when suddenly, he's jolted awake

06:04.180 --> 06:08.015
by a jarring physical sensation.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.536
It was like being chained
to the bottom of the ocean.

06:11.688 --> 06:14.264
You can't move,
you can't breathe.

06:14.282 --> 06:18.710
You open your eyes, and there is
a presence in the room with you.

06:18.937 --> 06:21.129
You can't make out
who it is, what it is.

06:22.365 --> 06:23.790
It looks like...

06:23.942 --> 06:26.510
just a dark entity.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.203
The air behind them--

06:29.223 --> 06:30.463
I don't know
how to describe this--

06:30.616 --> 06:33.517
It's kind of fuzzy,
it's kind of moving.

06:34.803 --> 06:36.953
And then I was just trying

06:36.972 --> 06:40.232
to make something move
or come out of me,

06:40.383 --> 06:43.217
and it ended in just
the most bloodcurdling scream

06:43.311 --> 06:45.219
that I could get
out of my mouth.

06:45.239 --> 06:48.240
- (screams)
- As soon as I screamed,

06:48.467 --> 06:50.224
my girlfriend that was
laying next to me woke up,

06:50.318 --> 06:51.910
and I turned the light on...

06:53.155 --> 06:55.414
and it was gone.

06:55.565 --> 06:59.809
NARRATOR: Paul is uncertain
how long the encounter lasted,

06:59.828 --> 07:02.145
but it was only
the first of several

07:02.164 --> 07:05.482
that would take place
over the next five years.

07:05.575 --> 07:09.261
Each left him paralyzed
with fear.

07:09.412 --> 07:11.337
CHRISTENSEN: At the
time these were happening,

07:11.432 --> 07:13.247
I was frightened for my life.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.659
Part of me feels like

07:15.752 --> 07:19.271
there's some kind
of demonic presence around them.

07:19.498 --> 07:22.348
I've never felt that they were
there for good intentions.

07:22.443 --> 07:25.610
It's always come with
a heavy feeling of darkness...

07:27.931 --> 07:29.263
that they were there
for something

07:29.357 --> 07:31.616
other than anything good.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.770
NARRATOR: While Paul's
encounters with shadowy beings

07:35.789 --> 07:38.773
have left him frightened
and desperate for answers,

07:38.792 --> 07:41.534
his experience is not unique.

07:41.628 --> 07:46.965
In 2001, author Heidi Hollis
released<i> The Secret War,</i>

07:47.116 --> 07:50.694
in which she shared
her own startling experiences

07:50.712 --> 07:53.138
with entities
she called shadow people.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.200
HEIDI HOLLIS: I don't even know
how to describe that level of fear,

07:57.293 --> 07:59.811
because it was absolutely
hulking over me.

08:02.057 --> 08:03.965
And this started
my whole journey

08:03.984 --> 08:06.559
into the topic of shadow people.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.712
I'm a person that's not afraid

08:08.805 --> 08:10.972
to say I've experienced
something.

08:11.066 --> 08:14.141
I'm like, bring it out into the
light, and let's talk about it.

08:14.236 --> 08:19.831
From the start, when I finally
got the book published in 2001,

08:20.058 --> 08:23.409
thousands of people
from around the world,

08:23.504 --> 08:27.914
from priests to schoolteachers,
have written me seeking help.

08:28.066 --> 08:31.234
So my goal is to try
to help people to understand

08:31.327 --> 08:33.086
that you can keep
these things at bay.

08:33.238 --> 08:35.514
NARRATOR:
According to Heidi's research

08:35.741 --> 08:37.924
collecting and studying
people's encounters,

08:38.018 --> 08:40.426
these dark entities can appear

08:40.521 --> 08:43.763
as various shapes and figures.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.842
The experiences that I receive
often involve a person

08:47.861 --> 08:50.529
waking up, and they feel
a presence is in the room.

08:51.757 --> 08:54.199
And if they spot it,

08:54.426 --> 08:58.111
the thing comes even closer
and pins them down,

08:58.205 --> 09:00.780
and they're paralyzed.

09:00.932 --> 09:03.099
They often come at nighttime
because your guard is down,

09:03.192 --> 09:05.451
so they're
taking advantage of you

09:05.546 --> 09:07.937
when you're not at your best.

09:08.031 --> 09:10.940
So, they're sneaky,
they're deceptive,

09:11.034 --> 09:13.200
and they evoke
a lot of horrific things

09:13.295 --> 09:15.945
into people's lives.

09:15.964 --> 09:19.558
NARRATOR: The dark, humanoid
appearance of shadow beings

09:19.709 --> 09:23.728
has caused some to identify them
as apparitions or ghosts.

09:23.880 --> 09:27.123
But many researchers believe
the shadow people

09:27.216 --> 09:29.976
are a much different type
of entity.

09:30.128 --> 09:33.963
A ghost is a human spirit

09:34.057 --> 09:36.390
that is taking some sort
of corporeal form.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.969
With a ghost, we get a lot
of detail in the apparition.

09:39.988 --> 09:41.913
We can see facial features.

09:42.140 --> 09:45.658
We can see clothing.
We can see details in the hair.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.044
Where with shadow entities,
we get almost nothing.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.089
NARRATOR:
While many psychologists

09:51.240 --> 09:53.666
continue to dismiss
the phenomenon

09:53.760 --> 09:55.668
as a symptom of sleep paralysis,

09:55.821 --> 09:59.413
researchers point out
that people have reported

09:59.433 --> 10:03.343
encounters that happened
when they were wide awake.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.253
In my own personal experience
with the shadow people,

10:06.273 --> 10:08.773
I was getting ready to go
to sleep, sitting up in bed,

10:08.925 --> 10:12.001
and all of a sudden,
this black humanoid figure

10:12.020 --> 10:15.280
enters into the room,
walks across the room.

10:15.507 --> 10:18.265
I follow it and watch it,
and it just vanishes.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.768
I didn't experience any fear.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.846
I was totally perplexed
by what I've seen

10:22.939 --> 10:24.748
and thought,
"Wow, what was that?"

10:25.959 --> 10:27.459
HOLLIS:
Believe it or not,

10:27.610 --> 10:29.777
the first shadow people
experience that I had

10:29.796 --> 10:32.279
was witnessing it following
another friend of mine

10:32.299 --> 10:34.115
in broad daylight.

10:34.209 --> 10:37.284
And I saw this entity,
this big, hulking black mass--

10:37.379 --> 10:38.970
It kind of looks like a man

10:39.122 --> 10:41.122
with its head directly connected
to its shoulders--

10:41.141 --> 10:43.032
Going tree to tree

10:43.051 --> 10:45.459
and bush to bush
as we're walking along.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.313
And I was just beside myself.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.649
The whole way that we go,
we see this thing.

10:50.876 --> 10:53.300
I really thought, you know,
I just witnessed

10:53.395 --> 10:56.396
one crazy thing,
and that was it.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.973
I trust myself, and I know
what it is I experienced,

10:58.992 --> 11:01.067
and I know what was going on.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.721
NARRATOR: If the so-called
shadow people are not merely

11:04.814 --> 11:07.648
a trick of the mind
but very real

11:07.668 --> 11:10.410
and possibly dangerous entities,

11:10.504 --> 11:12.486
what exactly are they?

11:12.506 --> 11:14.989
Perhaps further clues
can be found

11:15.008 --> 11:16.749
by examining similar accounts

11:16.843 --> 11:21.137
that were recorded
thousands of years ago.

11:28.413 --> 11:30.021
NARRATOR:
Choctaw Nation, Oklahoma.

11:30.248 --> 11:32.173
This nearly
seven-million-acre territory

11:32.192 --> 11:35.418
is home to Native people
who have occupied North America

11:35.437 --> 11:38.345
for more than 4,000 years.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.774
The Choctaw continue to carry on
the centuries-old traditions

11:41.927 --> 11:45.036
of their ancestors to this day.

11:45.263 --> 11:48.598
And one story
that continues to loom large

11:48.616 --> 11:51.117
is that of the Nalusa Chito,

11:51.269 --> 11:55.455
which the Choctaw describe
as a shadow being.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.457
This Nalusa Chito

11:57.609 --> 12:01.052
is a demonic entity.

12:02.630 --> 12:06.466
And the Choctaw believe that if
you're having bad thoughts,

12:06.618 --> 12:10.228
that this will attract
the Nalusa Chito to you.

12:10.379 --> 12:12.455
YOUNG:
The Nalusa Chito

12:12.474 --> 12:15.066
would get you
by creeping inside you

12:15.218 --> 12:17.477
and eating your soul.

12:17.629 --> 12:20.463
The Choctaw were so afraid
of this creature,

12:20.556 --> 12:22.240
they would not say the name.

12:23.726 --> 12:26.727
And many people would move along
and abandon huts and things

12:26.747 --> 12:30.373
because of the fear
of this shadow figure.

12:32.477 --> 12:34.994
BIRNES:
We see the shadow people

12:35.146 --> 12:38.314
in the stories
of other Native American people.

12:38.407 --> 12:41.334
On Native American reservations,

12:41.486 --> 12:43.577
particularly
the Jicarilla Apache reservation

12:43.597 --> 12:45.263
in Dulce, New Mexico,

12:45.414 --> 12:47.657
they talk
about the shadow people

12:47.675 --> 12:50.918
as if they are
their regular companions.

12:51.012 --> 12:53.830
The legend is this.

12:53.848 --> 12:58.351
If a shadow person,
who's really a spirit, sees you

12:58.445 --> 13:01.780
and that shadow people
attaches itself to you,

13:01.931 --> 13:04.908
it will be with you
for the rest of your life.

13:06.435 --> 13:08.602
NARRATOR: The traditions
of these Native American tribes

13:08.696 --> 13:11.030
originated centuries ago.

13:11.182 --> 13:14.459
And as ancient astronaut
theorists point out,

13:14.610 --> 13:17.962
accounts of shadowy entities
can be found in the legends

13:18.189 --> 13:21.115
of ancient cultures
all around the world.

13:21.209 --> 13:24.527
While there are stories of
shadow people in modern times,

13:24.546 --> 13:26.863
what I find interesting is

13:26.881 --> 13:30.716
there are also references
to what seem to be

13:30.869 --> 13:33.627
shadow people in ancient texts,

13:33.647 --> 13:36.964
and frankly,
they're very strange accounts.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.392
Shadow beings
go far back into antiquity,

13:39.486 --> 13:41.820
all the way back
to the time of ancient Sumer,

13:42.047 --> 13:45.990
where, in that culture,
you see accounts of Alû,

13:46.142 --> 13:48.326
which is a type of udug,

13:48.553 --> 13:50.829
which, in their culture,
was a type of demon.

13:50.980 --> 13:54.574
Now, Alû, in the way
that he would appear to people,

13:54.668 --> 13:56.909
it was very much like
our shadow entities of today

13:57.062 --> 13:59.153
where he was very dark
in nature.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.732
He had no facial features,
no eyes, no nose, no mouth,

14:02.750 --> 14:04.759
and he would hover
over people at night.

14:06.329 --> 14:08.329
YOUNG: Of course, there
are many accounts of demons

14:08.348 --> 14:09.906
in the scriptures,

14:09.999 --> 14:12.258
the Christian Bible, the Talmud.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.853
In Jewish lore,
there is the shadow of death

14:15.004 --> 14:16.429
or the death shadow.

14:16.581 --> 14:18.915
There is this idea
that there are

14:19.008 --> 14:21.508
malevolent spirits
that could harm you.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.195
NARRATOR: Commonly
compared with the shadow people

14:24.422 --> 14:28.274
is an entity known in Islam
as the djinn,

14:28.426 --> 14:31.685
supernatural creatures
that are often invisible

14:31.705 --> 14:34.780
and have the ability
to shape-shift.

14:34.875 --> 14:39.452
The derivation of djinn
comes from an Arabic, uh, root,

14:39.546 --> 14:43.548
J-N-N, which literally means
to hide or to conceal.

14:45.110 --> 14:48.035
The djinn are created
of smokeless fire.

14:48.129 --> 14:50.296
Our English word "genie,"

14:50.390 --> 14:53.116
you know, the mythical spirit
that lives inside of a lamp,

14:53.134 --> 14:55.376
comes from the word "djinn."

14:55.470 --> 14:58.955
RICKSECKER: The djinn are
considered more trickster in nature.

14:59.048 --> 15:01.290
They have
some interesting abilities,

15:01.309 --> 15:03.568
such as
they can instantly transport

15:03.719 --> 15:07.130
from one place to another.

15:07.148 --> 15:11.058
They also seem to appear
very dark and shadowy in nature,

15:11.077 --> 15:13.894
that they were these big,
looming type of characters

15:13.988 --> 15:16.822
when they enter the room.

15:16.917 --> 15:20.585
As a Muslim, you know,
I believe the djinn to be real.

15:20.736 --> 15:22.921
Djinn can be angelic.

15:23.072 --> 15:25.164
They can be demonic.

15:25.316 --> 15:27.316
And so, this idea is

15:27.410 --> 15:29.427
that you have to be careful
with them

15:29.654 --> 15:31.578
because they are
these powerful figures.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.415
They are these
literally supernatural figures.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.917
And so, across the Muslim world,

15:37.011 --> 15:40.012
in the present day, particularly
in places like North Africa,

15:40.165 --> 15:41.681
you may wear an amulet.

15:41.833 --> 15:43.942
You may have things
to ward off the djinn.

15:44.093 --> 15:45.592
You may have,
you know, certain things

15:45.612 --> 15:47.779
that you do to protect you
from the djinn,

15:48.006 --> 15:50.173
because the idea is
that the djinn,

15:50.266 --> 15:53.451
when they're
in their demonic capacity,

15:53.678 --> 15:55.602
will do things
that can be harmful

15:55.622 --> 15:58.030
or tormenting to human beings.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.366
What I find fascinating is that
you have a myriad of cultures

16:00.518 --> 16:01.942
from all over the world

16:01.962 --> 16:03.536
that have
very, very similar beliefs

16:03.688 --> 16:05.112
about these shadow entities.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.873
Now, they may call it
something different,

16:07.968 --> 16:11.694
but you see in Turkey
the Karabasan, the dark presser,

16:11.787 --> 16:14.880
as a very, very similar entity

16:15.033 --> 16:18.701
as to the kana tevoro in Fiji

16:18.794 --> 16:20.961
as to the Pisadeira in Brazil.

16:20.981 --> 16:24.148
They're all talking
about the same type of being,

16:24.300 --> 16:25.984
the same type of entity,

16:26.135 --> 16:29.636
and it calls into question,
how are these beings visiting

16:29.656 --> 16:32.548
all of these different cultures
from all over the world

16:32.567 --> 16:34.492
since they did not have
any contact with each other?

16:36.237 --> 16:38.721
GEORGE NOORY: Historically,
since the beginning of time,

16:38.740 --> 16:42.908
we have had creature stories
of strange beings,

16:43.061 --> 16:45.578
of shadows, of the bogeyman.

16:45.730 --> 16:48.064
And they somehow echo
some of the reports

16:48.082 --> 16:49.490
that we're hearing today.

16:49.584 --> 16:51.400
They're somewhat similar.

16:51.494 --> 16:52.918
I don't think
they've ever gone away.

16:53.071 --> 16:54.804
They're still here
on the planet.

16:56.257 --> 16:58.665
NARRATOR: Have separate
cultures around the world

16:58.685 --> 17:00.501
and throughout history

17:00.520 --> 17:04.263
been haunted
by the same dark figures?

17:04.415 --> 17:08.359
And if so, just what kind
of entities are they?

17:08.511 --> 17:10.862
Perhaps further clues
can be found

17:11.013 --> 17:14.848
by examining eyewitness accounts
of strange energy

17:14.868 --> 17:17.660
when face-to-face
with shadow people.

17:27.105 --> 17:28.362
NARRATOR:
Virginia City, Nevada.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.381
October 28, 2016.

17:30.533 --> 17:33.125
Researcher Michelle LeBaron
and a group of colleagues

17:33.278 --> 17:36.295
are investigating reports
of a shadowlike entity

17:36.447 --> 17:39.873
at a historic saloon
called the Washoe Club.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.118
RICKSECKER:
She and another woman

17:42.211 --> 17:44.711
ventured
into one particular room.

17:44.806 --> 17:47.640
And between her and her friend,

17:47.792 --> 17:50.884
this large shadow loomed up.

17:50.904 --> 17:55.131
She described it as about
six-five, six-six in height.

17:55.224 --> 17:57.967
But, again,
very, very dark in nature,

17:57.985 --> 17:59.560
so there was no detail.

17:59.654 --> 18:01.728
At one point, she thought

18:01.748 --> 18:04.731
it had completely engulfed
her friend,

18:04.826 --> 18:07.919
and they ended up screaming
and running out of the room.

18:10.406 --> 18:12.757
Now, this woman,

18:12.984 --> 18:14.908
a few minutes later,
after they collected themselves,

18:14.928 --> 18:17.002
walked back over to the hall,

18:17.097 --> 18:21.841
and there stood again
this very tall, dark shadow,

18:21.993 --> 18:23.843
but it started doing
something very unusual.

18:23.995 --> 18:26.345
There was this pulsating energy

18:26.497 --> 18:28.164
that was emanating forth
from it,

18:28.257 --> 18:29.849
like a "whoop, whoop, whoop."

18:30.001 --> 18:32.110
And she could hear it
as well as feel it.

18:34.005 --> 18:37.782
In many cases,
people feel a certain energy

18:37.933 --> 18:41.010
projecting out
from these beings.

18:41.103 --> 18:43.287
And in this
particular woman's case,

18:43.439 --> 18:46.124
it was
this pulsating type energy.

18:46.275 --> 18:48.960
With other people,
it may be more constant.

18:49.111 --> 18:52.112
So, people are experiencing
different types of energy

18:52.132 --> 18:54.114
from these beings
but, with each of them,

18:54.208 --> 18:55.800
energy nonetheless.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.303
JASON OFFUTT:
I have interviewed people

18:59.455 --> 19:01.380
who have encountered
shadow beings,

19:01.532 --> 19:05.476
and they've heard what sounded
like electricity buzzing.

19:05.628 --> 19:07.628
Uh, and-and the sound
would disappear

19:07.647 --> 19:10.130
when the shadow people
left the room.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.724
RICKSECKER: There was
another woman I interviewed

19:11.818 --> 19:13.818
who saw a flash of light

19:14.045 --> 19:15.469
out in her hallway,
and all of a sudden,

19:15.488 --> 19:18.138
this shadow man
ran into her room,

19:18.232 --> 19:19.657
jumped on top of her

19:19.808 --> 19:22.493
and pressed her down
into the bed.

19:22.645 --> 19:23.886
And the shadow man
jumped back off,

19:23.979 --> 19:25.646
ran back out into the hallway,

19:25.665 --> 19:28.148
and she saw
another flash of light.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.742
The next morning
when she woke up,

19:29.836 --> 19:32.152
she noticed that

19:32.172 --> 19:35.748
all the electronics in that room
had been absolutely fried,

19:35.900 --> 19:37.416
and she had to call
the fire department

19:37.568 --> 19:39.468
for them to come
and inspect everything.

19:41.739 --> 19:45.090
NARRATOR: In addition to
hearing and feeling surges of energy,

19:45.243 --> 19:47.927
witnesses often report
another curious detail

19:48.021 --> 19:49.929
about the shadow people:

19:50.081 --> 19:52.839
the appearance of glowing eyes.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.434
HENRY:
A lot of the shadow people have

19:55.528 --> 19:58.587
no facial features whatsoever.
Just blackness.

19:58.681 --> 20:00.865
But some do have glowing eyes,

20:01.016 --> 20:04.260
and, in particular, it's the one
with the red glowing eyes

20:04.353 --> 20:06.186
that appear to be
the most malevolent.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.765
OFFUTT: When it comes
to shadow beings with eyes,

20:09.858 --> 20:12.526
especially blazing red eyes,

20:12.545 --> 20:16.029
people also experience a fear

20:16.049 --> 20:19.717
that is deeper than just
"there's an entity in my room."

20:19.868 --> 20:21.277
And they feel
that these entities

20:21.370 --> 20:23.796
are-are up to nefarious means.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.615
NARRATOR: So many
reports of shadow encounters

20:26.634 --> 20:29.134
are associated
with pulsating energy,

20:29.287 --> 20:32.805
glowing eyes
and electronic disturbances

20:32.957 --> 20:35.733
that researchers wonder
if some shadow entities

20:35.960 --> 20:39.195
might actually be
misunderstood technology.

20:40.465 --> 20:41.981
HENRY:
It's often discussed

20:42.133 --> 20:44.300
that powerful alien technology
can influence

20:44.393 --> 20:47.136
human electronics
and technology.

20:47.154 --> 20:48.913
This is definitely something
that is reported

20:49.064 --> 20:51.249
with the shadow people
experiences.

20:51.476 --> 20:53.584
RICKSECKER:
There's also an interesting idea

20:53.811 --> 20:56.312
in which these extraterrestrials
may be using

20:56.330 --> 20:58.664
some sort of cloaking device

20:58.816 --> 21:00.741
to hide themselves
from our view.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.335
But since they
may not quite understand

21:03.488 --> 21:05.412
the physiology of our eyes,

21:05.431 --> 21:07.990
it comes off
more of like a shadow.

21:08.009 --> 21:09.658
So, what we may be seeing

21:09.677 --> 21:12.436
is an imperfect type
of alien technology.

21:12.663 --> 21:15.331
OFFUTT: I've interviewed
two different people

21:15.349 --> 21:18.943
who have described to me
what sounds like it could be

21:19.094 --> 21:21.595
some sort
of cloaking technology.

21:21.614 --> 21:27.026
One person in particular
said that he saw a cloak open

21:27.178 --> 21:30.362
and saw beyond the disguise.

21:30.456 --> 21:34.107
And what he saw, he said,
was reptilian scales.

21:34.201 --> 21:38.354
Uh, I-I spoke with someone else
who saw something similar

21:38.372 --> 21:41.281
but described the skin
as more, like, slick.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.359
Like a...
like a frog's but gray.

21:43.377 --> 21:45.469
TSOUKALOS:
Could it be

21:45.696 --> 21:48.213
that we're not talking
about shadow people

21:48.366 --> 21:51.383
but some type of a technology

21:51.536 --> 21:55.054
that appeared like a shadow
and it maybe...

21:55.206 --> 21:57.056
You know, sometime
a technology did not work,

21:57.208 --> 21:59.558
it would reveal that person
underneath the cloak

21:59.710 --> 22:01.134
or underneath the device.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.561
And so they will be seen

22:02.713 --> 22:04.155
for maybe a fraction
of a second.

22:05.474 --> 22:07.399
NARRATOR:
For ancient astronaut theorists,

22:07.552 --> 22:09.401
the notion
that the shadow people

22:09.495 --> 22:12.221
might be some form
of misunderstood technology

22:12.314 --> 22:14.740
is an intriguing possibility.

22:14.892 --> 22:18.002
But what many consider
an absolute certainty

22:18.229 --> 22:21.839
is their connection
to extraterrestrials.

22:22.066 --> 22:25.343
As evidence,
they point to the many accounts

22:25.570 --> 22:28.087
linking
the shadow people phenomenon

22:28.239 --> 22:30.014
and alien abduction.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.333
There are a lot
of common denominators

22:33.353 --> 22:36.428
with people
who experience shadow figures

22:36.581 --> 22:38.097
and those who are abducted.

22:38.249 --> 22:40.358
You wake up
in the middle of the night.

22:40.509 --> 22:42.342
You are taken by surprise.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.587
You are paralyzed.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.922
You cannot move.
You cannot speak.

22:46.941 --> 22:48.866
You are helpless.

22:49.093 --> 22:52.870
You feel that this entity
has taken over you.

22:53.097 --> 22:55.856
It is projecting
some sort of energy

22:55.875 --> 22:58.876
that you cannot control.

22:59.027 --> 23:01.604
In my professional,
uh, experience

23:01.697 --> 23:03.864
as an investigative reporter

23:03.883 --> 23:06.442
talking
with maybe about 3,000 people

23:06.460 --> 23:09.870
in the abduction syndrome
over about four decades,

23:09.889 --> 23:12.781
one of the common experiences

23:12.875 --> 23:15.117
that you will hear
from abductees

23:15.136 --> 23:17.636
is that they feel paralyzed

23:17.788 --> 23:19.880
in the presence
of something in their room,

23:19.899 --> 23:21.899
usually an entity.

23:23.218 --> 23:25.736
A few call them shadow people.

23:26.981 --> 23:29.407
In March of 1991,

23:29.558 --> 23:32.818
in my mail,
I received an envelope

23:32.912 --> 23:36.138
that contained illustrations
and an audio cassette

23:36.157 --> 23:38.231
and a letter from a woman

23:38.251 --> 23:40.993
who lived
in Porterville, California.

23:41.145 --> 23:43.421
And part of the story
was her encounter

23:43.572 --> 23:45.405
with shadow people.

23:45.499 --> 23:48.050
And I would like to read a
little bit about what she wrote.

23:50.504 --> 23:53.246
"I was in bed asleep
when something woke me up.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.415
"The room was filled this time

23:55.435 --> 23:57.509
"with an orange glow,

23:57.662 --> 23:59.920
"and at the center of the room
was a hole,

23:59.939 --> 24:04.275
"out of which two well-formed,
seemingly three-dimensional

24:04.426 --> 24:06.927
"solid shadow people
were stepping.

24:07.021 --> 24:11.356
"The two shadow men grabbed me
and pulled me toward the hole.

24:11.509 --> 24:14.026
"That is the last I remember.

24:14.178 --> 24:17.012
"And later,
I realized that the little guy,

24:17.031 --> 24:19.515
"the Grey guy
that I call the creep,

24:19.533 --> 24:21.775
"was standing off to the right,

24:21.794 --> 24:24.444
"watching my reaction
to the whole thing.

24:24.464 --> 24:28.132
He also seemed to be in charge
of what was happening."

24:32.120 --> 24:35.121
NARRATOR: Could the
accounts of alleged alien abductees

24:35.141 --> 24:38.200
reveal that reports
of shadow people are, in fact,

24:38.293 --> 24:41.312
extraterrestrial encounters?

24:41.539 --> 24:43.981
Perhaps further clues
can be found

24:44.132 --> 24:47.543
by examining a shadowy being
often encountered

24:47.561 --> 24:49.712
by UFO witnesses,

24:49.730 --> 24:52.823
an entity known as the Hat Man.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.832
NARRATOR:
Shadow people witnesses

25:02.059 --> 25:04.393
often describe
the entities they encounter

25:04.411 --> 25:05.244
as appearing vaguely humanoid
with no discernible features.

25:05.338 --> 25:07.246
But in some accounts,

25:07.398 --> 25:10.657
they take
a curiously recognizable form.

25:10.751 --> 25:13.919
RICKSECKER: One of the most
mysterious types of shadow entities

25:14.071 --> 25:18.182
is what people refer to
as the Hat Man.

25:18.333 --> 25:19.758
This type of entity

25:19.910 --> 25:21.593
may be wearing a fedora-type hat

25:21.746 --> 25:23.670
with an accompanying
trench coat.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.098
It may be a top hat
with or without the cape.

25:26.192 --> 25:29.026
We don't see a lot of detail
with the Hat Man.

25:29.177 --> 25:32.512
We see that vague outline.

25:32.532 --> 25:36.700
OFFUTT: The Hat Man appears
just like any other shadow being.

25:36.927 --> 25:38.869
There's no definition.
You-you can't see,

25:39.021 --> 25:41.613
uh, a nose, a chin,
uh, the eyes.

25:41.766 --> 25:43.707
You see the outline of a fedora.

25:43.934 --> 25:45.768
RICKSECKER:
Many times, people report

25:45.786 --> 25:47.861
these hat-wearing entities

25:47.880 --> 25:50.789
coming into their bedrooms
at night, sometimes flanked

25:50.941 --> 25:53.867
by two humanoid type
of shadow entities.

25:53.961 --> 25:56.053
And they strike fear

25:56.204 --> 25:58.280
into the person there
lying in bed

25:58.299 --> 26:00.891
and, like an energy vampire,

26:01.043 --> 26:03.394
feed off of that fear.

26:03.621 --> 26:04.953
HOLLIS:
There's confusion out there

26:05.047 --> 26:06.730
between different entities.

26:06.957 --> 26:10.216
Something I once called
Hat Man shadow,

26:10.311 --> 26:12.127
he is not a shadow person.

26:12.146 --> 26:15.297
He can take on
different forms, yes,

26:15.316 --> 26:18.317
as far as being able
to blend into a shadow.

26:18.411 --> 26:20.911
But he could step out,
and he could be very solid,

26:21.138 --> 26:24.081
so he's a very different type
of entity.

26:24.232 --> 26:27.826
But people think
he directs the shadow people.

26:27.920 --> 26:32.664
So, shadow people are
essentially minions to Hat Man.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.909
NARRATOR: Could reports
of the so-called Hat Man

26:35.928 --> 26:39.338
shed new light
on the shadow people phenomenon?

26:39.490 --> 26:42.766
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

26:42.993 --> 26:45.251
one of the very first
reported encounters

26:45.346 --> 26:47.104
with these dark entities.

26:50.092 --> 26:51.775
Bridgeport, Connecticut.

26:52.002 --> 26:55.337
1953.

26:55.356 --> 26:56.947
Albert K. Bender,

26:57.174 --> 26:59.842
the nation's
top UFO investigator,

26:59.860 --> 27:01.619
receives a threatening visit

27:01.770 --> 27:06.365
that will bring his research
to an abrupt and premature halt.

27:06.517 --> 27:07.958
RICKSECKER:
Albert K. Bender founded

27:08.185 --> 27:09.627
the International
Flying Saucer Bureau.

27:09.854 --> 27:13.038
This was
during the big UFO flap of 1952

27:13.132 --> 27:15.448
when flying saucers were
witnessed over Washington, D.C.,

27:15.468 --> 27:17.301
and many other areas
around the world.

27:17.452 --> 27:20.195
And this organization
blew up big

27:20.214 --> 27:21.972
within that first year.

27:22.124 --> 27:26.535
However, just a year later,
he suddenly ended

27:26.553 --> 27:28.479
the International
Flying Saucer Bureau,

27:28.630 --> 27:30.981
and people wondered why.

27:31.133 --> 27:33.558
And what happened
was that he came home one night,

27:33.653 --> 27:35.319
went into his bedroom,

27:35.546 --> 27:39.564
and suddenly these three
dark, shadowy figures

27:39.717 --> 27:42.734
materialized through his wall
into his bedroom.

27:42.887 --> 27:45.570
They were wearing the hats
and the overcoats.

27:45.665 --> 27:49.482
They had glowing eyes,
and they smelled like sulfur.

27:49.502 --> 27:52.503
NARRATOR: According
to Bender, the three entities

27:52.730 --> 27:55.080
communicated with him
through telepathy,

27:55.232 --> 27:58.158
warning him to discontinue
his UFO research

27:58.177 --> 28:00.994
and stop publishing
his influential magazine,

28:01.013 --> 28:02.829
the<i> Space Review.</i>

28:02.923 --> 28:05.073
Afterwards, he became ill

28:05.167 --> 28:07.910
and didn't eat for three days.

28:07.928 --> 28:09.520
HENRY:
After this experience,

28:09.671 --> 28:11.504
Bender was repeatedly visited,
he said.

28:11.524 --> 28:12.523
They gave him headaches,

28:12.750 --> 28:14.692
they-they controlled him
telepathically,

28:14.919 --> 28:16.843
and he ultimately gave up
his UFO researches

28:16.862 --> 28:19.029
and stopped publishing
the<i> Space Review,</i>

28:19.256 --> 28:21.606
in which he documented
UFO sightings

28:21.701 --> 28:23.033
throughout the world.

28:25.262 --> 28:28.188
He told the people
that had been subscribers

28:28.207 --> 28:30.949
and he was working with,
"They told me,

28:31.101 --> 28:35.212
"'We come from a very,
very far distant place

28:35.363 --> 28:36.880
"'in this universe.

28:37.032 --> 28:39.441
"'And we have been coming
and going

28:39.534 --> 28:41.868
"'from your planet
for some time,

28:41.962 --> 28:44.370
"'and we cannot allow you

28:44.465 --> 28:46.873
"'or anyone to interfere.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.893
"'And, in fact,
we have taken many humans

28:50.045 --> 28:52.304
"'from this planet

28:52.398 --> 28:55.733
to cover up our operations
until we are done.'"

28:55.884 --> 29:00.145
RICKSECKER: This is a very
influential point in our history,

29:00.297 --> 29:02.055
especially
in the ufology community,

29:02.074 --> 29:04.633
in which shadow entities
interfered

29:04.726 --> 29:06.802
and thwarted somebody's research

29:06.820 --> 29:09.913
and possibly set the field back
a number of years.

29:10.065 --> 29:13.083
NARRATOR: The visitors
Albert Bender encountered

29:13.235 --> 29:16.253
match descriptions of what is
today known as the Hat Man,

29:16.480 --> 29:19.314
but he called them
by another name:

29:19.333 --> 29:21.407
the Men in Black.

29:21.502 --> 29:24.762
While the Men in Black are
often portrayed in pop culture

29:24.913 --> 29:26.579
as government agents,

29:26.599 --> 29:28.840
many who claim
to have encountered them

29:28.993 --> 29:31.251
believe they are
something other than human.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.770
HENRY:
The Men in Black are

29:32.921 --> 29:34.938
mysterious
and nefarious entities.

29:35.090 --> 29:38.166
They're shadowy.
They wear black clothing.

29:38.185 --> 29:40.760
Many people believe that they're
either extraterrestrials

29:40.780 --> 29:43.263
or somehow, they're working
for extraterrestrials

29:43.282 --> 29:45.282
to prevent humans
from learning the truth

29:45.433 --> 29:47.451
about extraterrestrials
on Earth.

29:50.531 --> 29:53.198
OFFUTT:
They talk to UFO witnesses.

29:53.350 --> 29:54.866
Some people have reported

29:54.960 --> 29:57.110
they seem to not know things
that are common,

29:57.129 --> 30:00.355
like, you know,
which end of a pen to use.

30:00.374 --> 30:03.041
Or, uh, if they're offered
something to eat or drink,

30:03.193 --> 30:05.135
they don't know
how to eat or drink it.

30:05.287 --> 30:07.879
HENRY: Both the Hat
Man and the Men in Black

30:08.032 --> 30:10.123
are known for wearing a hat.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.884
They both influence people
telepathically.

30:13.037 --> 30:16.054
They both appear
to be sometimes malevolent,

30:16.148 --> 30:18.557
and they could, in fact,
be the same type of a being.

30:18.709 --> 30:20.876
There's a theory
that the Hat Man

30:20.894 --> 30:23.061
and the Men in Black
are actually the ringleaders

30:23.213 --> 30:25.489
of the shadow people

30:25.716 --> 30:27.473
and that, in fact,
they direct the shadow people

30:27.493 --> 30:30.385
to influence humans
in particular

30:30.404 --> 30:33.789
to keep them from investigating
UFO experiences.

30:35.059 --> 30:36.391
NOORY:
There's no question

30:36.484 --> 30:38.669
that the stories
of shadow people,

30:38.896 --> 30:41.171
Men in Black
and other visitations

30:41.323 --> 30:43.415
are all mixed in together.

30:43.567 --> 30:46.068
Are they the same? Possibly.

30:46.086 --> 30:48.587
But what I think what is
really happening on this planet

30:48.681 --> 30:50.589
is mass hysteria

30:50.683 --> 30:53.241
of real events that are
happening to real people,

30:53.335 --> 30:56.578
and they can't understand
what's going on.

30:56.597 --> 30:57.646
Who knows what's happening?

30:59.191 --> 31:02.084
NARRATOR:
For ancient astronaut theorists,

31:02.102 --> 31:04.603
the wide variety of reported
shadow people encounters

31:04.697 --> 31:07.347
makes finding an explanation
for the phenomenon

31:07.441 --> 31:09.257
all the more difficult.

31:09.276 --> 31:12.352
But some researchers suggest

31:12.371 --> 31:14.187
that we may come closer
to the answer

31:14.281 --> 31:16.206
by asking the question,

31:16.358 --> 31:18.834
"Where do they come from?"

31:27.369 --> 31:28.944
NARRATOR: One of the most
common and most curious observations

31:29.037 --> 31:30.554
reported
by shadow people experiencers

31:30.705 --> 31:32.389
is that these entities
are able to make

31:32.540 --> 31:34.040
physical contact with them

31:34.059 --> 31:35.893
but then often disappear

31:36.120 --> 31:38.228
as though
they are merely holograms.

31:39.881 --> 31:43.734
OFFUTT: Generally, the
shadow people will leave the room.

31:43.961 --> 31:46.294
Either they will dissolve
in a puff of smoke

31:46.388 --> 31:47.863
or they will walk
through a door.

31:49.316 --> 31:52.484
And they may
or may not be material,

31:52.636 --> 31:55.987
have mass, have structural form.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.748
And there's been talk
about maybe they come

31:57.899 --> 32:00.325
from some other dimension.

32:00.477 --> 32:04.046
We take for granted that we live
in a three-dimensional universe.

32:05.499 --> 32:08.550
The quantum theory makes
possible higher dimensions.

32:09.820 --> 32:12.671
Think of fish living in a pond,
for example.

32:12.823 --> 32:15.340
The pond is two-dimensional.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.827
The fish are stuck
in a two-dimensional world.

32:18.845 --> 32:21.772
They cannot visualize
a third dimension.

32:21.923 --> 32:24.516
But you could lift
one of these fishes

32:24.668 --> 32:27.277
into the third dimension,
and they'd be shocked.

32:27.429 --> 32:29.780
Shocked to realize
there's a whole universe

32:30.007 --> 32:33.450
in the third dimension
beyond their pond.

32:33.601 --> 32:37.696
Well, we physicists, some of us
believe that we are the fish.

32:37.790 --> 32:41.107
We spend all our life
in a three-dimensional pond

32:41.201 --> 32:43.443
thinking
that that's all there is

32:43.537 --> 32:44.869
when right above us,

32:45.022 --> 32:47.464
there could be
higher dimensions,

32:47.615 --> 32:50.592
hyperspatial dimensions
up to 11.

32:52.120 --> 32:55.547
RICKSECKER: Theoretically,
we have up to 11 dimensions,

32:55.699 --> 32:57.790
and there may be other entities
and other life-forms

32:57.884 --> 32:59.792
living within these dimensions.

32:59.812 --> 33:02.370
Now, how would they look to us

33:02.464 --> 33:04.706
if they crossed
over those dimensions

33:04.799 --> 33:06.891
and entered into our world?

33:07.044 --> 33:09.878
Well, maybe a shadow entity

33:09.896 --> 33:12.397
is one of these
interdimensional beings

33:12.549 --> 33:15.400
that has crossed over from
some other place in space-time

33:15.494 --> 33:16.994
into our world.

33:17.145 --> 33:19.329
And we're seeing them
as a shadow

33:19.556 --> 33:23.834
because their energy
and their personal resonance

33:23.985 --> 33:26.819
doesn't quite adhere

33:26.839 --> 33:30.007
to the energy
and the resonance of our planet.

33:31.326 --> 33:33.010
NOORY:
If shadow people exist,

33:33.237 --> 33:35.754
and it's very possible
that they do,

33:35.848 --> 33:37.756
I think they're coming
from other dimensions

33:37.908 --> 33:39.182
within our universe.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.928
I think there are entities
that somehow leak through

33:44.081 --> 33:46.005
because some of them
even look disoriented,

33:46.025 --> 33:47.932
like they-they don't know
where they are.

33:48.027 --> 33:50.769
Somehow, they're coming
through another dimension

33:50.863 --> 33:52.529
into ours,

33:52.680 --> 33:54.197
and we're stuck with them.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.276
NARRATOR: Could it be that
shadow people experiencers

33:58.428 --> 34:00.353
are witnessing entities

34:00.372 --> 34:03.373
that are capable of traveling
between dimensions?

34:03.600 --> 34:05.767
According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

34:05.786 --> 34:07.693
there is evidence

34:07.788 --> 34:11.548
that certain places on Earth
act as interdimensional portals.

34:11.699 --> 34:13.699
RICKSECKER:
We see shadow entities

34:13.719 --> 34:16.219
in these certain locations
around the world

34:16.446 --> 34:18.704
in which they seem
to appear more often.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.782
There are locations
around our planet

34:20.875 --> 34:23.134
where there's more
of that Earth energy

34:23.287 --> 34:25.228
that is rising
out of the ground.

34:25.455 --> 34:27.622
You know, Stonehenge,
the pyramids,

34:27.641 --> 34:30.625
Carnac,
places with that ancient energy

34:30.718 --> 34:32.903
that's rising from the ground.

34:33.054 --> 34:36.965
Now, an interdimensional being
may be using those locations

34:36.983 --> 34:39.701
to enter into our domain.

34:41.154 --> 34:44.230
NARRATOR: Some researchers
believe it is also possible

34:44.249 --> 34:45.990
that shadow people

34:46.085 --> 34:48.310
can alter the human mind

34:48.403 --> 34:50.754
to see into other dimensions.

34:50.905 --> 34:52.756
BIRNES:
Ancient peoples believe

34:52.907 --> 34:55.592
that shadow people
have the ability

34:55.743 --> 34:58.486
to enter a person's mind

34:58.580 --> 35:01.098
and change
that person's perception

35:01.325 --> 35:04.492
so the person
can see the spirit.

35:04.511 --> 35:08.754
They've entered
from their world into our world.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.850
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

35:12.002 --> 35:14.277
the notion that the human mind
can be altered

35:14.429 --> 35:16.504
to access other dimensions

35:16.523 --> 35:18.598
is supported by experiments

35:18.617 --> 35:21.509
with a powerful hallucinogen
called dimethyltryptamine,

35:21.528 --> 35:23.286
or DMT,

35:23.513 --> 35:25.622
the active ingredient
in ayahuasca.

35:26.792 --> 35:29.200
This South American drug

35:29.294 --> 35:31.019
is traditionally used
throughout the Amazon

35:31.112 --> 35:34.464
to produce intense visions.

35:34.616 --> 35:38.284
Between 1990 and 1995,

35:38.303 --> 35:41.045
scientists
at the University of New Mexico

35:41.198 --> 35:43.623
administered DMT
to 60 volunteers

35:43.642 --> 35:45.383
and were surprised

35:45.535 --> 35:48.536
to find that many of them
had very similar visions,

35:48.555 --> 35:52.891
including encounters
with strange beings.

35:52.985 --> 35:56.486
One of the greatest scholars
about the effect of DMT

35:56.638 --> 35:59.138
and human beings and what we see
in the other world

35:59.232 --> 36:01.324
is Terence McKenna.

36:02.569 --> 36:04.828
Terence McKenna explained

36:04.979 --> 36:08.648
that the strangest thing
to him was

36:08.667 --> 36:11.984
those who'd taken ayahuasca
generally saw the same thing.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.578
What did they see?

36:13.730 --> 36:15.563
Little green people.

36:15.582 --> 36:17.582
People like Terence McKenna

36:17.734 --> 36:20.159
are saying that's the entrance
to another world,

36:20.179 --> 36:22.679
another dimension.

36:22.830 --> 36:25.665
And we know, he says,

36:25.684 --> 36:28.000
that it has a separate existence
from us

36:28.020 --> 36:31.262
because people
from all different walks of life

36:31.415 --> 36:33.190
see the same thing.

36:33.341 --> 36:35.767
HENRY:
These beings appear to be coming

36:35.919 --> 36:38.253
from higher or lower realms

36:38.346 --> 36:40.530
and entering
into our physical realm,

36:40.757 --> 36:42.273
perhaps to demonstrate
that we, too,

36:42.426 --> 36:44.367
can cross over
into these realms.

36:44.519 --> 36:47.095
It's very important
that we understand the nature

36:47.188 --> 36:48.947
and origins of these beings

36:49.099 --> 36:51.041
because it could be
that they are gonna lead us

36:51.192 --> 36:54.360
to innumerable different species
that exist in our universe

36:54.454 --> 36:55.879
as well as how we, too,

36:56.030 --> 36:58.381
can cross over
into these other realms.

36:58.533 --> 37:02.368
NARRATOR: Experiments with
electric stimulation of the brain

37:02.387 --> 37:05.722
have also caused people to have
unexplainable encounters.

37:05.873 --> 37:07.465
OFFUTT:
There was a study

37:07.559 --> 37:10.134
done, uh, in-in Sweden

37:10.287 --> 37:12.454
where these scientists
put electric charges

37:12.547 --> 37:14.289
in certain parts of the brain

37:14.307 --> 37:17.400
just to see how the subject
would react to them.

37:17.552 --> 37:20.737
And a young undergrad was
sitting there with a notebook,

37:20.964 --> 37:23.131
and when they increased
the voltage

37:23.149 --> 37:24.908
to a certain part of her brain,

37:25.059 --> 37:26.985
she started pulling away

37:27.137 --> 37:29.471
from something
that wasn't there.

37:29.564 --> 37:31.639
And afterwards,
uh, when she was asked

37:31.658 --> 37:33.992
by the scientist
to describe what was going on,

37:34.086 --> 37:37.312
she said that she saw
a shadow entity behind her.

37:37.330 --> 37:39.923
And when the voltage
was at its highest,

37:40.074 --> 37:41.907
she said it was trying
to take the notebook and pen

37:41.927 --> 37:43.409
out of her hands,
and she was jerking

37:43.428 --> 37:45.820
to keep it from removing them.

37:45.913 --> 37:48.506
So, is it some part of our brain

37:48.658 --> 37:50.675
that needs an electrical charge

37:50.827 --> 37:53.103
or some charge from ayahuasca

37:53.330 --> 37:55.847
to help us see
what's already there?

37:55.941 --> 37:57.232
Very possibly.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.351
NARRATOR:
Are shadow people witnesses

38:00.504 --> 38:04.339
encountering entities
from other dimensions?

38:04.432 --> 38:06.524
Some ancient astronaut theorists

38:06.618 --> 38:10.345
suggest there is an even more
profound explanation:

38:10.363 --> 38:13.790
that just outside the range
of human perception,

38:13.941 --> 38:16.442
Earth is inhabited
by a great multitude

38:16.536 --> 38:19.296
of otherworldly beings.

38:24.619 --> 38:26.636
NARRATOR:
The dark, hulking figure

38:26.788 --> 38:28.880
that comes in the night
and paralyzes its prey

38:28.974 --> 38:32.100
remains the most common
shadow people experience.

38:33.645 --> 38:36.871
But reports of these entities
appearing in broad daylight,

38:36.890 --> 38:39.983
as well as other types
of shadow people accounts,

38:40.210 --> 38:42.802
make it difficult
for investigators to pin down

38:42.821 --> 38:45.655
exactly what this phenomenon is.

38:48.068 --> 38:50.142
When it comes to the different
types of shadow entities,

38:50.162 --> 38:51.494
their behavior, to me,

38:51.721 --> 38:53.738
differentiates
one from the other.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.391
The ones that don't pay
any attention to people at all,

38:56.409 --> 38:58.651
they could be interdimensional.

38:58.745 --> 39:02.672
The ones that are spying on us
could be extraterrestrial.

39:02.824 --> 39:04.674
The ones that instill fear

39:04.826 --> 39:07.177
could be demonic entities.

39:07.404 --> 39:10.922
So, even though
they look the same,

39:11.074 --> 39:13.850
generally, I-I don't think
a lot of them are.

39:15.837 --> 39:19.263
HENRY: The multifactorial
explanation makes a lot of sense.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.340
It could explain
why some of them instill fear

39:21.434 --> 39:23.008
and some of them don't,

39:23.028 --> 39:24.844
why some of them appear
during daytime

39:24.863 --> 39:26.696
and some of them
only appear at nighttime.

39:26.848 --> 39:28.698
The fact is
we just don't know enough

39:28.850 --> 39:30.441
about the shadow people,

39:30.594 --> 39:33.203
and a lot more research
needs to be done.

39:33.430 --> 39:35.947
NARRATOR:
While answers remain elusive,

39:36.041 --> 39:38.875
one popular new theory
is that the shadow people

39:39.102 --> 39:42.361
exist outside the limits
of human perception,

39:42.381 --> 39:45.273
not occupying
an alternate dimension

39:45.291 --> 39:47.291
but vibrating at a frequency

39:47.444 --> 39:50.053
we are not normally able
to perceive.

39:51.448 --> 39:53.281
TSOUKALOS:
It's a scientific fact

39:53.299 --> 39:57.877
that the human eye
can only see certain things.

39:57.896 --> 40:02.232
For example, we cannot see
the infrared light spectrum.

40:02.459 --> 40:06.628
So you have to wonder
if shadow people operate

40:06.646 --> 40:11.557
in a spectrum that we humans
simply cannot see.

40:11.576 --> 40:15.412
And perhaps there are
certain people

40:15.639 --> 40:18.823
whose brains operate
in a different way,

40:18.975 --> 40:21.901
and they're able to process

40:21.920 --> 40:25.422
more of the reality
that we currently experience.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.167
CORY: There are other
spectrums that continue on

40:29.261 --> 40:33.488
past our physical brain
and our physical self.

40:33.581 --> 40:36.674
And so, why is it so difficult

40:36.826 --> 40:40.562
to imagine that these entities
could be existing?

40:41.831 --> 40:44.256
That these entities exist

40:44.350 --> 40:46.759
in these other spectrum

40:46.853 --> 40:49.003
and tap into our spectrum

40:49.022 --> 40:51.072
at will and upon command.

40:52.358 --> 40:54.433
RICKSECKER:
I think the benefit for mankind

40:54.453 --> 40:57.102
in learning
about these entities...

40:57.197 --> 41:00.014
I think we'd get a better
understanding of our universe

41:00.033 --> 41:02.608
and how everything
in this universe is connected.

41:02.702 --> 41:04.461
You know, I to you.

41:05.855 --> 41:08.465
Us to the planet,
the planet to the Sun

41:08.616 --> 41:11.801
to the solar system
to our galaxy.

41:11.953 --> 41:15.046
Everything is interconnected.
We're all made of stardust.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.973
And I think we'll have
a better understanding

41:17.124 --> 41:18.308
of our origins

41:18.535 --> 41:20.535
and where we're going
in the future.

41:20.553 --> 41:22.053
TSOUKALOS:
One can argue,

41:22.205 --> 41:24.388
"Oh, it's just a figment
of their imagination."

41:24.541 --> 41:26.207
But some of these people
have experienced this

41:26.226 --> 41:29.210
for their entire lives.

41:29.229 --> 41:31.729
And I think
that we need to investigate

41:31.823 --> 41:34.824
and listen to the people
who tell us these stories.

41:36.069 --> 41:37.902
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

41:38.054 --> 41:40.238
that humankind shares the Earth

41:40.390 --> 41:41.739
with other intelligent beings

41:41.891 --> 41:45.502
that only a select few
are able to perceive?

41:45.729 --> 41:49.154
Perhaps the next step
in humankind's evolution

41:49.174 --> 41:53.568
will not involve the development
of spacefaring technology

41:53.661 --> 41:56.846
but an expansion
of consciousness,

41:57.073 --> 41:59.574
allowing us to see
for the first time

41:59.592 --> 42:02.835
that we truly are not alone,

42:02.929 --> 42:06.189
even on our own planet.
