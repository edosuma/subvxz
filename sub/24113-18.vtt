Magnus would never agree to it.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.080
Don't give him the choice.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.170
In fact...

10:53.170 --> 10:55.670
Magnus can never know about
our little arrangement,

10:55.670 --> 10:57.170
or else the deal is off.

11:00.170 --> 11:01.960
Break his heart...

11:01.960 --> 11:04.460
to save his life.

lose the costume.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.250
Why?

11:29.250 --> 11:30.250
No one else is wearing one.

11:31.580 --> 11:33.250
What are you talking about?
Look, that guy's

11:33.250 --> 11:34.620
dressed as a devil.

11:34.620 --> 11:35.880
He's a warlock.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.000
Those horns are real.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.170
Really?

11:39.170 --> 11:40.960
All warlocks have
an animal feature.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.040
A mark.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.040
Oh...

11:44.040 --> 11:45.880
So, how do they hide these marks

11:45.880 --> 11:46.920
every other day of the year?

11:46.920 --> 11:49.000
With a glamour.
It's the magic we all use

11:49.000 --> 11:52.040
to hide our supernatural traits
from mundanes such as yourself.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.790
But tonight,
all glamours are down.

11:54.790 --> 11:57.460
Halloween's the one night
we get to just be ourselves.

Wait, did you just say "we?"

Oh... cool!

12:09.540 --> 12:10.880
(SONOROUS VIBRATION)

12:12.750 --> 12:14.920
I ran some tests
on Jonathan's blood.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.540
The Heavenly Fire serum
caused a reaction that purged

12:17.540 --> 12:18.920
all of its demonic essence.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.210
So, injecting Jonathan will
burn away all his demon blood?

12:21.210 --> 12:24.420
And his demonic
connection with Clary.

12:24.420 --> 12:27.330
We finally found a way to
separate you from your brother.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.830
So, once we remove
the Twinning Rune,

12:29.830 --> 12:32.380
he won't have
any influence over you.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.790
He won't be able to hurt you.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.000
What will the injection
do to him?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.750
It will hurt. A lot.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.170
You'll feel it too.

12:41.170 --> 12:42.790
But only until
the connection breaks.

12:42.790 --> 12:45.420
After that,
both of you will be fine.

12:45.420 --> 12:46.880
Let's do it.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.250
Kiddo.

Luke!

12:55.830 --> 12:57.250
How did you get out of prison?

12:57.250 --> 12:59.080
The Praetor Lupus pulled
some serious strings.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.040
I'll tell you
the whole story later.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.920
Right now, I'm just here
to support my daughter.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.830
Glad to have you back, Luke.

13:04.830 --> 13:06.880
We'll meet you downstairs.

13:06.880 --> 13:07.880
Yeah.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.620
I can't believe
you're actually here.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.290
I'm sorry I was ever gone.

13:15.250 --> 13:18.080
And thank you for looking
after her while I was away.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.040
Always.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.580
Let's get this rune off me.

little sister.

13:31.460 --> 13:32.540

13:32.540 --> 13:34.120
Well, you can still stop it.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.120
I don't want to.

You're making
a terrible mistake.

Each vial of serum contains
nanoparticles of Glorious.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.210
I can separate the particles out

15:17.210 --> 15:19.580
and use them to create a new,
more potent formula.

what if you could?

you could never see her again?

ever go through that again.

He was rejected by my parents.

by Lilith.

Well, I'm still adjusting
to life as a mundane,

from your shining example.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.580

already found one.

and I were vicious rivals.

then in the Circle. And now...

figure out what we are.

get to Jonathan...

you told me after my relapse?

I was gonna propose
to Magnus last night.

Yes, but just listen.

I got the family ring.
I had a whole dinner prepared.

21:06.540 --> 21:09.620
And Magnus showed up
drunk out of his mind.

21:09.620 --> 21:12.580
He told me how miserable
he is without his magic.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.500
Oh, no...

21:15.500 --> 21:16.670
I've never seen him so low.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.830
I had to do something,
so I decided...

21:20.830 --> 21:22.710
...I would speak with Asmodeus.

21:22.710 --> 21:23.920
You did what?

21:23.920 --> 21:25.380
I didn't summon him.

21:25.380 --> 21:27.420
I spoke to him through
a warlock conduit.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.170
He agreed

21:29.170 --> 21:30.920
to restore Magnus's magic.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.500
But only if I broke up with him.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.420
You're not considering it,
are you?

21:35.420 --> 21:37.460
Magnus lost his magic in
the first place because of me.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.460
He chose to save Jace.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.960
He knew I'd never get over
losing my parabatai.

21:43.830 --> 21:47.040
Magnus sacrificed everything
so I could feel whole.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.080
And now, I have the chance
to do the same for him.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.960
He wouldn't want this.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.040
He loves you so much.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.000
I know.
