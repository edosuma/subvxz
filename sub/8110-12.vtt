WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:05.239
EXCUSE ME, WAITRESS?

00:05.273 --> 00:07.175
I'M AFRAID
THE TERIYAKI CHICKEN'S

00:07.208 --> 00:08.709
NO LONGER ON THE MENU.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.279
OH, I'M SORRY.

00:11.312 --> 00:12.380
THAT'S WHAT
YOU HAD LAST TIME.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.248
WE'VE NEVER
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.717
I DEFINITELY REMEMBER YOU.
NO, WE NEVER GET UP NORTH.

00:16.750 --> 00:17.751
WE'RE JUST UP TO SEE
A FRIEND OF OURS

00:17.785 --> 00:19.587
WHO MOVED HERE
LAST SUMMER.

00:19.620 --> 00:23.624
YOUR HAIR WAS LIGHTER.
YOU HAD LITTLE ROUND GLASSES.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.259
SOUNDS LIKE YOU.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.261
HENRY, DON'T PLAY ALONG.
IT'S A GIMMICK FOR TIPS.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.796
COULD WE GET SOME WATER?

00:30.831 --> 00:32.266
[high-pitched static]

00:32.300 --> 00:34.102
IT WAS LAST AUGUST.
SATURDAY, THE 14TH.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.137
YOU WERE WEARING
A BLUE DRESS WITH POLKA DOTS.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.205
YOUR EYES WERE PUFFY,

00:37.238 --> 00:38.306
LIKE YOU'D BEEN CRYING.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.410
THE 14TH
IS DARREN'S BIRTHDAY.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.777
HE SAID HE HAD
TO CANCEL HIS PARTY

00:43.811 --> 00:45.613
'CAUSE HIS OLD GIRLFRIEND
SHOWED UP.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.248
THEY GOT INTO A HUGE FIGHT.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.183
HENRY...
I KNEW IT.
DAMN IT.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.251
EVER SINCE THAT SKI TRIP

00:50.284 --> 00:51.385
WHEN THE TWO OF YOU
DISAPPEARED.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.521
I'LL GO...GET YOUR WATER.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.827
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:59.860 --> 01:02.230
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:02.263 --> 01:07.268
[hyperventilating]

01:07.301 --> 01:09.270
I CAN'T MOVE MY LEGS!

01:11.339 --> 01:14.308
[Massive Attack's Teardrop]

01:14.342 --> 01:22.350

01:42.370 --> 01:44.538
PICTURE A DOOR.

01:44.572 --> 01:47.408
UNLOCKED WITH THE KEY
OF THE MIND.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.744
TWO MEDICAL CASES, BOTH
MORE FASCINATING THAN THE LAST.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.381
(Martha)
NO LOGICAL SENSE.ES

01:53.414 --> 01:55.383
THIS IS NOT A DOOR
TO LOGICAL SENSE.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.185
ALSO, SHUT UP.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.820
CASE NUMBER ONE.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.922
33-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

02:01.955 --> 02:03.924
NAMED...

02:03.957 --> 02:05.159
SOMETHING I CAN'T REMEMBER.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.395
YOU'LL SEE THE IRONY
IN A SECOND.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.430
PRESENTING WITH
TEMPORARY PARALYSIS,

02:09.463 --> 02:10.898
HIGH CK LEVELS,

02:10.931 --> 02:14.502
AND A PERFECT MEMORY.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.638
HOW PERFECT IS PERFECT?

02:17.671 --> 02:19.307
PERFECTLY PERFECT.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.308
HYPERTHYMESIA.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.942
COMPLETE RECALL

02:21.975 --> 02:22.943
OF EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY DAY

02:22.976 --> 02:24.178
SINCE PUBERTY.

02:24.212 --> 02:27.881
ALL 7,600,049 OF THEM.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.917
IT'S COOL, HUH?

02:29.950 --> 02:32.453
ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL
OF RECORDED CASES.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.587
SO WE HAVE TWO SYMPTOMS:

02:33.621 --> 02:35.856
TEMPORARY LEG PARALYSIS
AND ELEVATED CK.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.825
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT SUFFERING
FROM THE SAME CONDITION

02:37.858 --> 02:40.428
'CAUSE YOU'VE ALREADY FORGOTTEN
MY DRAMATIC VOICEOVER.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.529
THERE'S A THIRD SYMPTOM.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.431
HER MEMORY'S UNRELATED.
WHY?

02:43.464 --> 02:44.832
IT'S A STRANGE
MEDICAL PHENOMENON--

02:44.865 --> 02:47.401
HYPERTHYMESIA IS KNOWN
TO MANIFEST IN ADOLESCENCE.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.837
YEAH, IN THE WHOLE FIVE
DOCUMENTED CASES.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.373
TO BE RELATED, IT WOULD MEAN
20 YEARS BETWEEN SYMPTOMS.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.841
PLUS, I DON'T KNOW
OF ANY DISEASES

02:53.874 --> 02:54.842
THAT CAUSE GREAT MEMORY.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.577
ONLY ONES THAT DESTROY IT.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.979
MRI SHOWED NO EVIDENCE
OF STROKE OR TUMOR,

02:59.012 --> 03:00.414
SO PROBABLY A TOXIN.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.549
SHE'S A WAITRESS.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.550
THEY'RE NO STRANGERS

03:02.583 --> 03:03.917
TO BOTULISM OR ALCOHOLISM.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.753
WE SHOULD SEARCH THE DINER
AND WHERE SHE LIVES.

03:05.786 --> 03:06.987
OR YOU COULD
SEARCH HER BRAIN.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.922
YOU KNOW,
WHERE HER MEMORY LIVES.

03:08.956 --> 03:09.857
SAVE THE GAS.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.725
YOU TWO CHECK HER HOME.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.361
YOU TWO GET A COMPLETE
PATIENT HISTORY.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.630
WE'LL SEE WHO GETS
AN ANSWER FIRST.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.899
YOU SAID THERE'S
A SECOND CASE?

03:18.932 --> 03:19.967
OH! YEAH.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.869
THANKS.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.605
[groans]

03:24.638 --> 03:27.541
THE CASE OF
THE 45-YEAR-OLD DOCTOR

03:27.575 --> 03:31.245
WHO JUST FAILED HIS PATHOLOGY
RECERTIFICATION EXAM

03:31.279 --> 03:32.746
AND IS GOING TO LOSE
HIS BOARD CERTIFICATION

03:32.780 --> 03:33.881
AND GET FIRED.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.317
HOW'D YOU FAIL IF YOU
SPEND HALF YOUR LIFE IN THE LAB?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.419
I WAS RECOVERING
FROM THE FLU.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.020
I'M RETAKING IT NEXT WEEK.
IT'S NOT AN ISSUE.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.021
NORMALLY, I'D LET

03:41.054 --> 03:42.523
DARWINISM RUN ITS COURSE.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.991
BUT CUDDY'S IN A BIG TIZZY

03:44.024 --> 03:45.893
ABOUT HER POSTER BOY
GETTING CANNED.

03:45.926 --> 03:49.497
SO HOW ARE WE GONNA GET
THE SHORT GUY OFF THE SHORT BUS?

03:49.530 --> 03:51.265
WHAT ABOUT A TUTOR?
I DON'T NEED A TUTOR.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.032
TUTOR IT IS.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.534
CHOOSE YOUR POISON.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.936
CHASE, IF YOU PREFER
POUNDING AUSSIE BEERS

03:55.969 --> 03:58.439
AND COMMISERATING OVER
THE SUCKINESS OF DIVORCE.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.575
MASTERS, IF YOU WANT
NERVOUS ENERGY, FLASH CARDS,

04:01.609 --> 04:04.044
AND OBNOXIOUS PIECES
OF ARCANE TRIVIA.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.746
FOREMAN, IF YOU
NEED TO BE BERATED

04:05.779 --> 04:07.981
BY A HUMORLESS HARD-ASS.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.517
FOREMAN.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.018
INTERESTING.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.554
YOU MUST BE MORE WORRIED
THAN YOU LOOK.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.394
I NEED A CONSULT,
DR. WILSON.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.930
SO CALL ME IN A WEEK
IF IT STILL ITCHES.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.298
THANK YOU.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.367
AND BE SURE TO GIVE SARAH
A KISS FOR ME.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.403
WILL DO.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.538
WHO'S SARAH?

04:30.571 --> 04:32.306
HER GRANDDAUGHTER,
I THINK.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.042
EARLY STAGES OF DEMENTIA.
WHAT'S THE CONSULT?

04:35.075 --> 04:36.544
I NEED YOUR MEDICAL OPINION

04:36.577 --> 04:38.546
ON WHAT BAR WE'RE GONNA HIT
FOR HAPPY HOUR TONIGHT

04:38.579 --> 04:40.080
TO KICK OFF THE OFFICIAL END

04:40.113 --> 04:42.350
TO YOUR THREE-MONTH
PITY PARTY OVER SAM.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.017
I CAN'T TONIGHT.

04:44.051 --> 04:44.985
BECAUSE OF SARAH?

04:45.018 --> 04:46.320
YES, BECAUSE OF

04:46.354 --> 04:47.621
MY SENILE PATIENT'S
GRANDDAUGHTER.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.590
YOU CAUGHT ME.
I'M BUSY!

04:55.095 --> 04:56.764
WHO'S SARAH?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.799
WILSON'S FRIEND.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.768
MY COMPUTER CRASHED.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.803
LOST MY DATABASE
OF HIS ACQUAINTANCES.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.839
OR YOU'RE BOTH LYING TO ME.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.842
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WILSON
HAVING A FRIEND NAMED SARAH.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.511
SATISFIED?

05:14.147 --> 05:15.549
NOOO.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.986
WHAT ARE THE EIGHT TYPES
OF VOMITUS?

05:19.019 --> 05:20.588
I COULD SHOW YOU FOUR
RIGHT NOW

05:20.621 --> 05:22.390
IF YOU ASK ME
ONE MORE REVIEW QUESTION.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.724
HEY, YOU PICKED ME.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.058
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
A HARD-ASS.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.026
NO, HOUSE SAID THAT.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.629
I PRETENDED TO AGREE
TO GET HIM OFF MY BACK.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.064
I PICKED YOU BECAUSE
I WANTED THE GUY

05:31.098 --> 05:32.065
WHO DOESN'T LIKE
GETTING INVOLVED

05:32.099 --> 05:33.467
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.802
YES, I THOUGHT
YOU'D WANT TO SKIP

05:34.835 --> 05:37.505
THE MASSIVE PUBLIC HUMILIATION
OF GETTING FIRED.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.506
BY TREATING ME
LIKE I'M AN IMBECILE?

05:38.539 --> 05:40.441
I'M TOTALLY FINE.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.710
I ACED MY FIRST
PATHOLOGY BOARDS.

05:42.743 --> 05:46.113
MEDICINE HAS COME A LONG WAY
IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.848
YOU KNOW...

05:47.881 --> 05:49.116
I HEARD OF A GUY

05:49.149 --> 05:50.584
WHO KNEW A GUY

05:50.618 --> 05:53.353
WHO COULD GET THE EXAM
AHEAD OF TIME.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.057
IT WAS SOMETHING I HEARD.
PATIENT'S FILE

05:57.090 --> 05:59.393
SAID SHE LOST SOME WEIGHT
ON A NEW DIET, RIGHT?

05:59.427 --> 06:00.528
YEAH, SHE WENT VEGAN.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.463
ARE LAXATIVES VEGAN?

06:04.097 --> 06:06.166
[cell phone ringing]

06:06.199 --> 06:07.835
HELLO?

06:07.868 --> 06:08.836
(Foreman)
WHERE ARE YOU?

06:08.869 --> 06:09.870
IN THE PARKING GARAGE,

06:09.903 --> 06:11.972
SEARCHING WILSON'S CAR.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.408
WE HAVE AN ANSWER.
MAGNESIUM POISONING.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.644
(Foreman)
WE FOUND A PRETTY LARGE
STASH OF LAXATIVES.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.145
ABUSE CAN LEAD
TO HYPERMAGNESEMIA.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.648
I ADMIT THAT'S...

06:20.681 --> 06:23.484
IMPRESSIVELY OUTSIDE-THE-BOX
THINKING.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.719

06:29.122 --> 06:30.858

YOU STILL THERE, HOUSE?

06:33.661 --> 06:35.162
(Taub)
EVERYTHING OKAY?

06:38.031 --> 06:40.601
NO.

06:40.634 --> 06:41.735
FOR A SECOND,
I THOUGHT WILSON

06:41.769 --> 06:43.170
MIGHT HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM.

06:43.203 --> 06:46.540
TURNS OUT IT'S MUCH,
MUCH WORSE.

06:46.574 --> 06:50.210
OKAY...UH,
SO WE PUSH FLUIDS

06:50.243 --> 06:52.145
AND WAIT FOR HER KIDNEYS
TO CLEAR THE HYPERMAGNESEMIA?

06:52.179 --> 06:54.948
YOU'LL BE WAITING A LONG TIME
SINCE THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE HAS.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.150
HER BP AND RESPIRATORY RATE
ARE NORMAL.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.587
WHILE YOU TWO WERE SO BUSY BEING
IMPRESSIVELY OUTSIDE THE BOX,

06:59.620 --> 07:03.457
YOU MISSED THE ACTUAL BOX.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.225
CHASE AND MASTERS DONE YET?

OF PINOT ON THE 17TH.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.967
UH, NOTHING FROM THE 18TH.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.236
SHOULDN'T YOU BE WORKING
FOR NASA OR SOMETHING?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.038
YOU MEAN WHY AM I
JUST A WAITRESS?

07:18.071 --> 07:20.641
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN...

07:20.674 --> 07:22.476
I'M SORRY, I-I-I-I...

07:22.510 --> 07:24.645
IT'S OKAY.

07:24.678 --> 07:25.846
REMEMBERING SOMETHING

07:25.879 --> 07:27.114
IS NOT THE SAME
AS UNDERSTANDING IT.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.649
I'M NOT A GENIUS.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.084
I LOVE MY JOB.
I'M GREAT AT IT.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.586
KEEPS MY MIND BUSY.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.556
HI.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.257
I'M DR. HOUSE.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.093
YOU ARE NOT POOPING.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.665
QUESTION IS,
ARE YOU ALSO A KLUTZ?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.900
UH...

07:46.934 --> 07:49.503
I GUESS I'M NO CLUMSIER
THAN MOST PEOPLE.

07:49.537 --> 07:50.638
WHAT ARE YOU GUESSING FOR?

07:50.671 --> 07:51.639
YOU'VE GOT A PERFECT MEMORY.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.642
I WAS TOLD THERE'D BE
NUMBERS, DATES, FIREWORKS.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.877
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.111
LET'S GO BACK TO 2008.

07:58.145 --> 08:02.282
HOW MANY TRIPS, STUMBLES,
FALLS DID YOU HAVE?

08:02.315 --> 08:05.586
[high-pitched static]

08:05.619 --> 08:06.854

08:08.622 --> 08:10.558
THIS REALLY WORKS.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.959
COOL.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.127
HOW 'BOUT 2009?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.563
12.

08:15.596 --> 08:16.930
EVEN COOLER.
LAST YEAR?

08:16.964 --> 08:18.832
20.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.536
THAT'S A BIG SPIKE
IN DISCOORDINATION.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.172
IF YOU ADD THE CONSTIPATION,
IT'S EARLY ONSET PARKINSON'S.

08:25.205 --> 08:29.543
GIVE HER A FULL NEURO EXAM,
START HER ON LEVODOPA.

08:33.146 --> 08:34.815
[door unlatching]

08:36.850 --> 08:38.986
OH, I'M SO SURPRISED
YOU BROKE INTO MY APARTMENT

08:39.019 --> 08:40.020
WITHOUT TELLING ME.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.021
WHAT IS THIS?

08:41.054 --> 08:42.255
AN INTERVENTION.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.057
EXHIBIT A.

08:44.091 --> 08:47.027
A BAGGIE FILLED
WITH NEPETA CATARIA,

08:47.060 --> 08:47.928
ALSO KNOWN AS...

08:47.961 --> 08:50.130
THAT HAD BETTER NOT BE
WHAT I THINK IT IS.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.999
IF YOU MEAN YOUR NEW
JUNKIE GIRLFRIEND,

08:52.032 --> 08:53.100
THEN YES.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.036
[meow]
HOUSE...

08:56.069 --> 08:58.606
OKAY, FINE.
I GOT A CAT.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.973
RELEASE THE KRAKEN.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.208
I DON'T THINK YOU APPRECIATE

09:01.241 --> 09:02.976
THE SEVERITY
OF YOUR SITUATION.

09:03.010 --> 09:06.346
YOU ARE RAPIDLY APPROACHING
END-STAGE MALE SPINSTERISM.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.181
[cell phone beeping]
THAT CAT,

09:08.215 --> 09:10.951
THAT DIABETIC CAT THAT YOU'RE
SHOOTING UP WITH INSULIN

09:10.984 --> 09:13.220
AND BUYING DIME BAGS
OF CATNIP FOR,

09:13.253 --> 09:16.056
THAT MEANS YOU'VE GIVEN UP
ON EVER FINDING ANYONE.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.592
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
COMPLETELY OVERREACTING?

09:18.626 --> 09:19.760
IF I'M COMPLETELY
OVERREACTING,

09:19.793 --> 09:20.794
WHY'D YOU LIE TO ME?

09:20.828 --> 09:23.931
UM, BECAUSE I KNEW YOU WOULD
COMPLETELY OVERREACT.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.966
ITS NAME'S SARAH.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.234
CATS AREN'T NAMED THAT.
WOMEN ARE.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.069
WHAT THE FREUD
IS THAT ABOUT?

09:29.102 --> 09:31.004
LOOK, I DIDN'T NAME HER.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.039
MY NEIGHBOR DID.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.107
SHE DIED, AND I FELT BAD.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.276
SARAH WOULD HAVE BEEN
DESTROYED AT THE SHELTER.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.046
AWW, WHO WOULD WANT
A CAT THAT CROAKS

09:39.079 --> 09:40.147
IF YOU'RE NOT HOME
TWICE A DAY

09:40.180 --> 09:42.049
TO SHOOT IT UP?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.151
IT'S LIKE HAVING
YOUR OWN BUTTON ON LOST.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.954
YOU KNOW, I'M PRETTY SURE

09:46.987 --> 09:49.890
THAT THERE IS
A RIVER NEARBY.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.925
I'M KEEPING HER.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.831
OKAY, SHRUG YOUR SHOULDERS

09:57.865 --> 10:00.167
AND DON'T LET ME
PUSH THEM DOWN.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.170
SO I HAVE TO ASK, UH...

10:03.203 --> 10:04.805
IS THERE A TRICK YOU USE?

10:04.838 --> 10:06.039
MNEMONICS?

10:06.073 --> 10:08.008
MEDITATION?

10:08.041 --> 10:09.309
NO, NO TRICKS.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.310
I DON'T EVEN TRY, REALLY.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.746
IT'S JUST THERE.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.116
IS MY MEMORY GONNA
GO AWAY...

10:16.149 --> 10:17.217
WITH THE PARKINSON'S?

10:17.250 --> 10:18.752
IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.053
BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT
OF TESTS TO DO

10:20.087 --> 10:21.421
BEFORE WE HAVE
A DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.190
WELL, HERE'S HOPING
FOR CANCER.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.761
NADIA?

10:28.896 --> 10:30.764
YOUR BOSS CALLED ME.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.065
SORRY, UM...

10:32.099 --> 10:34.101
I'M ELENA,
NADIA'S OLDER SISTER.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.237
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE HERE.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.874
BUT I'D LIKE TO PRETEND
YOU'D VISIT ME

10:40.908 --> 10:41.909
IF I WERE IN THE HOSPITAL.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.010
[scoffs]

10:43.043 --> 10:44.411
YOU BROUGHT DAISIES.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.080
[high-pitched static]

10:47.114 --> 10:48.181
THEY'RE YOUR FAVORITE.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.416
NO, THEY'RE
MY LEAST FAVORITE.

10:49.449 --> 10:53.020
I WAS STUNG IN THE FACE
SIX TIMES BY--

10:53.053 --> 10:56.256
[high-pitched humming]
OH, GOD.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.891
WHAT'S WRONG?
[rapid beeping]

10:57.925 --> 10:59.793
MY HEART.

10:59.827 --> 11:00.828
FAST, WIDE-COMPLEX RHYTHM.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.229
GET THE PADDLES.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.330
[beeping continues]

11:05.799 --> 11:07.434
CARDIAC INVOLVEMENT
RULES OUT PARKINSON'S.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.036
WE'RE BACK TO TRANSIENT
PARALYSIS

11:09.069 --> 11:10.103
AND HIGH CK,
PLUS ARRHYTHMIA.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.240
MASTERS, WHEN YOU FINALLY
BLOSSOM INTO A WOMAN,

11:13.273 --> 11:15.008
WOULD YOU EVER SLEEP WITH
A MAN WHO HAD A CAT?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.110
[sighs]
SURE.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.312
WRONG, THE ANSWER IS NO.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.282
SLUT.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.752
ANY OF YOU EVER HAD A CAT?

11:24.785 --> 11:27.154
ANY OF YOU EVER HAD SEX?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.189
I THINK,
AS YOUR PEOPLE SAY,

11:29.222 --> 11:30.758
QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUM.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.960
AN EXCESS OF CATECHOLAMINE
COULD SET OFF AN ARRHYTHMIA.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.895
IT'S NOT A PHEO.
HER BLOOD PRESSURE'S FINE.

11:34.928 --> 11:35.963
MAYBE WE'RE MISSING
THE OBVIOUS.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.164
THE HEART COULD BE
BEHIND EVERYTHING.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.299
IF IT'S NOT PUMPING
EFFECTIVELY,

11:39.332 --> 11:41.001
THE MUSCLES SHUT DOWN.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.103
CK ELEVATES.
COORDINATION SUFFERS.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.772
WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ABOUT CATS?

11:44.805 --> 11:48.008
CURIOSITY.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.277
CAN WE FOCUS HERE?

11:50.310 --> 11:51.111
UH, HER HEART PROBLEMS

11:51.144 --> 11:53.146
STARTED WHEN NADIA
SAW HER SISTER.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.782
STRESS-INDUCED ARRHYTHMIA

11:54.815 --> 11:57.918
COULD BE CAUSED BY
LONG QT SYNDROME.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.787
HER SISTER WAS BARELY
IN THE ROOM FIVE MINUTES.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.054
SHE SAID
THEY'D BEEN ESTRANGED

12:01.088 --> 12:02.089
FOR OVER SIX YEARS.

12:02.122 --> 12:02.990
THAT'S A LOT OF TENSION.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.425
RUN A STRESS TEST
TO CONFIRM LONG QT.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.794
IT'LL HAVE TO BE
DRUG-INDUCED.

12:06.827 --> 12:07.961
TREADMILL WILL
PULL HER STITCHES.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.963
DRUGS ARE NEVER THE ANSWER.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.198
IF WE WANT HER HEART
TO GO CRAZY,

12:11.231 --> 12:12.833
THERE'S SOMETHING
SIMPLER AND SAFER.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.203
USE THE SISTER.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.145
YOU LIED TO ME.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.079
NO.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.048
I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT WILSON

12:28.081 --> 12:29.249
HAVING A FRIEND NAMED SARAH.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.550
[shuts drawer]
UNDER HOUSE RULES,

12:30.583 --> 12:31.952
THAT IS NOT A LIE.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.222
HE'S LONELY.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.925
A CAT IS A NICE WAY
FOR HIM TO GET SOME AFFECTION.

12:37.958 --> 12:38.959
THAT'S NOT
THE KIND OF PUTTY TAT

12:38.992 --> 12:39.960
HE NEEDS TO BE
GETTING IT FROM.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.294
HE NEEDS A PUTTY TAT
HE CAN TAP.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.296
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

12:43.330 --> 12:44.231
[sighs]

12:44.264 --> 12:45.833
AFTER DIVORCE NUMBER TWO,

12:45.866 --> 12:47.400
HE FELL INTO
A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP

12:47.434 --> 12:49.269
WITH A THREE-LEGGED SIAMESE.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.838
HE STOPPED
ANSWERING HIS PHONE,

12:50.871 --> 12:52.973
REDECORATED HIS PLACE
LIKE GREY GARDENS.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.274
HE WASN'T ABLE
TO COME BACK TO HUMANITY

12:54.307 --> 12:55.442
UNTIL A WINDOW WAS LEFT

12:55.475 --> 12:58.912
SUSPICIOUSLY
AND HEROICALLY OPEN.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.348
HOW THAT CAT OPENED THE WINDOW,
I WILL NEVER KNOW.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.416
HE JUST NEEDS MORE TIME.

13:05.418 --> 13:08.288
LEAVE HIM AND THE CAT ALONE.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.858
I WON'T IF YOU WILL.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.860
[door closes]

13:13.961 --> 13:15.528
SORRY ABOUT THE DAISIES.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.931
I ALWAYS GET IT CONFUSED
IF YOU LOVE OR HATE THEM.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.266
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
EXACTLY HOW MANY TIMES

13:19.299 --> 13:20.467
I'VE TOLD YOU
THAT I HATE THEM?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.269
I DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.373
HER HEART RATE
ISN'T MOVING.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.209
THE SISTER STRESS POT
NEEDS STIRRING.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.344
YOU WANT ME
TO START A FIGHT?

13:31.378 --> 13:32.379
NO.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.947
JUST AGITATE A LITTLE.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.115
USE SOMETHING
FROM THE HISTORY.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.516
YOU'RE NOT LYING TO THEM.

13:36.549 --> 13:37.951
IN FACT, YOU'D BE
TELLING THE TRUTH,

13:37.985 --> 13:39.352
AND SERVING
THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.189
[sighs]

13:50.263 --> 13:51.965
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER
IN A WHILE, HUH?

13:53.566 --> 13:54.567
I HEARD THE STORY

13:54.601 --> 13:56.269
ABOUT THE TIME

13:56.303 --> 13:57.137
YOU HIT NADIA
WITH THE CAR.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.638
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
PRETTY SCARY.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.374
[high-pitched static]

14:01.408 --> 14:03.043
WHY WOULD YOU
TELL THEM THAT?

14:03.076 --> 14:04.344
THEY ASKED ABOUT
BROKEN BONES.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.046
I SWEAR THAT I
CHECKED MY MIRROR.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.380
YOU KNOW THAT'S A LIE.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.416
YOU KNEW
I WAS GETTING THE MAIL,

14:09.449 --> 14:12.052
AND YOU JUST DIDN'T CARE
ENOUGH TO CHECK!

14:12.085 --> 14:13.286
JUST LIKE YOU DIDN'T CARE

14:13.320 --> 14:15.122
THAT YOU RUINED
MY 23RD BIRTHDAY!

14:15.155 --> 14:16.323
NADIA, DON'T START!

14:16.356 --> 14:19.059
YOU STARTED BY COMING HERE,
ACTING LIKE YOU GIVE A CRAP!

14:19.092 --> 14:20.460
HERE WE GO AGAIN!

14:20.493 --> 14:22.362
I'M SUCH A MONSTER
BECAUSE I BROUGHT DAISIES!

14:22.395 --> 14:24.064
[alarm beeping]

14:24.097 --> 14:25.165
YOU--YOU NEED TO LEAVE
RIGHT NOW.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.333
WHAT?
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.468
ELENA, GET OUT!

14:28.501 --> 14:31.104
[alarm continues]

14:36.944 --> 14:38.445
YOU SAID YOU'D BE
TEN MINUTES.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.048
I COULDN'T DECIDE
ON THE CHEESE.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.516
WHEN ARE YOU GETTING
AN APARTMENT?

14:43.550 --> 14:45.185
OR AT LEAST A STORAGE ROOM?

14:45.218 --> 14:46.186
I'LL GET TO IT.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.387
I LIKE IT HERE.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.323
THEY HAVE VIDEO ON DEMAND.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.992
I PULLED A PRACTICE TEST.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.160
I HATE PRACTICE TESTS.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.561
HEY, I NEVER SAW
THE USUAL SUSPECTS.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.029
YOU WANNA CHECK IT OUT
BEFORE WE START?

14:56.063 --> 14:57.597
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'VE GOT THREE DAYS.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.132
WHY IS EVERYONE'S
FIRST ASSUMPTION

14:59.166 --> 15:00.968
I'M GONNA FAIL
THIS STUPID TEST?

15:01.001 --> 15:02.002
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU DID.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.004
I WAS RECOVERING
FROM THE FLU.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.238
I DON'T CARE IF YOU WERE
DYING FROM EBOLA.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.306
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
LESS THAN A 70.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.476
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT
EXCUSES AND DISTRACTIONS.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.411
WELL, IT'S A NICE MATCH
WITH YOUR CONDESCENSION

15:11.444 --> 15:12.980
AND SUPERIORITY.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.349
ENJOY THE MOVIE.

15:17.985 --> 15:21.354
KEVIN SPACEY
IS KEYSER SOZE.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.525
[door opens and slams]

15:33.000 --> 15:35.335
HOW IS SHE?

15:37.570 --> 15:39.006
WE STARTED HER
ON A BETA BLOCKER.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.274
IT SHOULD KEEP HER HEART RHYTHM
UNDER CONTROL.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.076
SHE'LL BE FINE
WHILE WE RUN MORE TESTS.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.178
DID YOU HEAR THAT SHE
BANNED ME FROM HER ROOM?

15:46.313 --> 15:47.380
I KNOW I'M NOT PERFECT,

15:47.414 --> 15:49.616
BUT SHE'S...

15:49.649 --> 15:53.520
OH, SHE CAN BE
SUCH A BITCH.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.688
SHE NEVER, EVER,
EVER LETS ANYTHING GO.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.725
[sighs]

15:58.758 --> 16:00.260
LOOK, TELL NADIA

16:00.293 --> 16:03.230
SHE DOESN'T NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT SEEING ME AGAIN.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.098
I STARTED THE FIGHT.

16:08.335 --> 16:12.072
WE NEEDED HER HEART RATE
TO RISE, SO I PROVOKED YOU.

16:14.574 --> 16:18.045
YOU CAN'T PLAY
WITH PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.380
MAYBE IF I EXPLAIN TO NADIA--

16:20.413 --> 16:21.581
NO, IT DOESN'T MATTER!

16:21.614 --> 16:24.251
IT'S JUST ONE MORE FIGHT
FOR HER TO REMEMBER.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.357
GUESS YOU'RE BOTH BITCHES.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.202
MASTERS.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.340
SMELL HER BREATH.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.508
BREATHE OUT.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.512
AMMONIA.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.081
WHAT IS IT?

16:54.114 --> 16:56.483
I THINK YOUR KIDNEYS
ARE SHUTTING DOWN.

17:00.387 --> 17:03.723
FAILING KIDNEYS PUTS THE HEART
BACK ON THE LIST AS A SYMPTOM.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.492
MAYBE SHE WENT VEGAN BECAUSE
SHE LOST THE TASTE FOR PROTEIN.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.094
COULD BE AMYLOIDOSIS.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.195
WE WOULD HAVE
SEEN A STIFF HEART

17:08.228 --> 17:09.329
ON THE NUCLEAR STUDY.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.131
BUT AUTOIMMUNE
COULD ACCOUNT

17:11.164 --> 17:13.333
FOR MULTIPLE ORGAN SYSTEMS
AND PARALYSIS.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.401
THERE ARE A NUMBER
THAT'D FIT.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.736
GUILLAIN-BARRE,
POLYMYOSITIS.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.072
MS, POLYARTERITIS NODOSA--

17:19.106 --> 17:20.607
SLE.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.075
WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME THESE?

17:22.109 --> 17:23.009
BECAUSE,

17:23.042 --> 17:25.078
WHILE THEY'RE OFF
RUNNING ALL THESE TESTS,

17:25.112 --> 17:26.846
YOU WILL BE SUBMITTING
THE INSURANCE FORMS.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.181
THERE'S AN ENTIRE DEPARTMENT
FOR THAT.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.849
EXACTLY.
THE FOREMAN DEPARTMENT.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.751
OF WHICH YOU ARE
THE FOREMAN, FOREMAN.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.120
I KNOW YOU GOT THE TIME.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.088
A LITTLE WALLABY TOLD ME
THAT YOU RECENTLY

17:35.122 --> 17:36.856
VACATED YOUR POST
AS TAUB'S SAVIOR.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.791
HE ASKED.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN MASTERS.

17:38.825 --> 17:39.826
HOW'S THIS MY FAULT?

17:39.859 --> 17:40.860
HE DOESN'T NEED A TUTOR.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.195
HE NEEDS RITALIN
AND A BABYSITTER.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.264
CONSIDER THE FORMS
INCENTIVE.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.865
TAUB DOESN'T PASS,

17:45.898 --> 17:48.201
HE'LL BECOME A PERMANENT
PART OF YOUR LIFE.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.506
THIS ISN'T REALLY
ABOUT CUDDY, IS IT?

17:53.540 --> 17:54.674
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

17:56.476 --> 17:59.212
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE ME.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.316
I THINK YOU CARE.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.654
DON'T THINK YOU CAN
DISGUST ME

18:07.687 --> 18:09.189
INTO PULLING FOREMAN
OFF YOU.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.291
PULSE THE PATIENT WITH STEROIDS
FOR THE AUTOIMMUNE.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.326
START HER ON DIALYSIS
FOR THE KIDNEY FAILURE.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.862
TREAT THE TAUB WITH
INSULTS AND SMALL SLAPS

18:15.895 --> 18:17.530
FOR THE OBSTINACY,

18:17.564 --> 18:20.733
AND START HIM ON STUDYING
FOR THE BRAIN FAILURE.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.705
[cat meowing]
NO, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.341
I HAVE A HAIRCUT
AT 4:00.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.809
I'LL BE IN THE OFFI--

18:29.842 --> 18:30.777
[sneezing]

18:30.810 --> 18:33.380
I'LL BE IN THE OFFICE
IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.215
[sneezes]

18:35.248 --> 18:37.150
YEAH, OKAY.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.225
[cat meows]

18:45.258 --> 18:48.195
[Wilson sneezing]

18:48.228 --> 18:49.729
AGH.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.232
[sniffles]

18:52.265 --> 18:54.334
YOU PLANTED SOMETHING
IN MY APARTMENT

18:54.367 --> 18:56.336
TO MAKE ME THINK
I'M ALLERGIC TO SARAH.

18:56.369 --> 19:01.274
PARANOIA IS THE FIRST SIGN
OF TOXOPLASMA GONDII,

19:01.308 --> 19:03.610
THE PARASITE LINKED TO
CRAZY CAT LADY DISEASE.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.444
I'M NOT PARANOID.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.180
I'M ALLERGIC TO RAGWEED
AND DANDELION.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.448
I'M NOT ALLERGIC TO CATS.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.582
YOU'RE TRYING
TO GASLIGH ME.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.950
MAYBE YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS

19:10.983 --> 19:13.286
IS AFRAID THAT YOU'RE
GONNA DIE ALONE.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.323
AND IT JUST COMES OUT
AS GIBBERISH AND SNEEZING.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.425
PROVE THAT I'M OVERREACTING.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.692
BOYS' NIGHT OUT.

19:19.726 --> 19:20.960
GOOD TIME CHARLIE'S.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.762
THEY JUST CHANGED
THEIR SLOGAN TO,

19:22.795 --> 19:24.964
"WHERE THE TRASHIEST LADIES
GET TRASHED."

19:24.997 --> 19:27.267
YOU DO SEE THE HYPOCRISY
IN ALL THIS, DON'T YOU?

19:27.300 --> 19:29.402
UNTIL RECENTLY,
YOUR LIFESTYLE OF CHOICE

19:29.436 --> 19:30.503
WAS SELF-EXILE.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.339
BUT I NEVER HAD A CAT.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.342
WHY DON'T YOU
PICK ME UP AT 8:00?

19:39.646 --> 19:41.881
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
ANOTHER ROUND OF STEROIDS.

19:41.914 --> 19:45.918
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'LL START YOUR DIALYSIS.

19:47.320 --> 19:51.724
SO I HEARD ELENA
MIGHT BE COMING BACK.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.693
YOU THINK I WAS...

19:53.726 --> 19:54.894
TOO HARD ON HER?

19:54.927 --> 19:56.996
WELL, WE ALL
HOLD OUR GRUDGES.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.731
IT'S NOT A GRUDGE.

19:58.765 --> 19:59.899
IT'S COMMON SENSE.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.468
IT'S SIMPLE MATH.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.003
SHE'S HURT ME
MORE THAN SHE'S HELPED ME.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.672
MOST PEOPLE
EDIT THEIR MEMORIES.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.973
THEY ADD SMALL LITTLE LIES

20:07.006 --> 20:09.342
SO THEY DON'T HAVE
TO FACE THE TRUTH.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.378
MY MEMORIES
REMAIN THE SAME.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.546
MY TRUTH NEVER CHANGES,
BECAUSE...

20:13.580 --> 20:15.815
MY TRUTH IS THE TRUTH.

20:15.848 --> 20:20.520
SO...NO ONE EVER
GETS FORGIVEN?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.289
SOUNDS LIKE
A LONELY WAY TO LIVE.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.556
NO, I-I DO FORGIVE.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.893
AS LONG AS THE GOOD THINGS
THEY DO...

20:26.926 --> 20:28.461
OUTWEIGH--

20:31.531 --> 20:33.433
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T BREATHE.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.268
[gasping]

20:46.846 --> 20:48.047
HUH.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.317
WHAT?

20:50.350 --> 20:51.250
NOTHING, I JUST...

20:51.284 --> 20:53.953
ALWAYS PICTURED YOUR PLACE
WITH SHAG CARPET.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.922
LIKE KIND OF A...

20:55.955 --> 20:58.425
MOD SQUAD VIBE.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.293
NOT BECAUSE OF
THE BLACK THING.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.695
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU WERE MORE OF A PETE--

21:02.729 --> 21:04.464
YOU'RE LIMITED TO THIS ROOM
AND MARCUS'S OLD ROOM.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.465
WHERE'S MARCUS?

21:05.498 --> 21:06.566
HE TELLS ME
HE'S WORKING

21:06.599 --> 21:07.567
WITH OUR UNCLE
IN FLORIDA.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.701
HE TELLS YOU?

21:08.735 --> 21:10.036
YOU DON'T LOOK AT
OR TOUCH ANYTHING

21:10.069 --> 21:11.771
THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU,
INCLUDING FOOD.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.606
YOU WILL STUDY
AND YOU WILL SLEEP.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.342
AND YOU WILL NOT LEAVE
MY SIGHT UNTIL THE EXAM.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.944
GREAT, I'LL BE BACK BRIGHT
AND EARLY TOMORROW, AND--

21:17.977 --> 21:19.646
THIS IS NO LONGER
JUST ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

21:19.679 --> 21:22.849
IT'S ABOUT MINE TOO.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.851
YOU FAIL,
AND I WILL KILL YOU.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.456
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
MEANS WE WERE WRONG

21:29.489 --> 21:31.358
ABOUT AUTOIMMUNE.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.092
(Masters)
COULD BE PULMONARY EDEMA
FROM RENAL FAILURE.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.294
[heart monitor beeping]

21:37.664 --> 21:39.566
PULMONARY EDEMA
DOESN'T GIVE YOU HIVES.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.734
YOU THINK THIS IS
AN ALLERGIC REACTION?

21:41.768 --> 21:43.836
IT CAN'T BE.
WE PUMPED HER FULL OF STEROIDS.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.877
IT CAN BE.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.745
IF IT WAS A REALLY,
REALLY BAD ONE.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.096
I HAVE GOOD NEWS
AND BAD NEWS.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.765
THE GOOD NEWS IS,
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU HAVING

22:12.799 --> 22:15.134
SOME AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.336
YOU'RE JUST ALLERGIC
TO THE DIALYSIS.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.373
BUT IF I CAN'T
HAVE DIALYSIS

22:20.407 --> 22:24.411
AND MY KIDNEYS
ARE FAILING,

22:24.444 --> 22:28.681
WON'T THAT MEAN I'LL DIE?

22:28.715 --> 22:31.117
WELL, YOU FIGURED OUT
THE BAD NEWS.

22:33.853 --> 22:34.821
WHAT DO WE DO?

22:34.854 --> 22:35.988
WE LOOK FOR
ANOTHER CASE.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.390
EVEN IF YOU'RE
RIGHT ABOUT AUTOIMMUNE,

22:37.424 --> 22:38.691
WE NOW DON'T HAVE
TIME TO PROVE IT.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.427
THE TRANSPLANT BOARD WILL
NEVER GIVE HER A KIDNEY.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.594
MAYBE WE COULD
GO AROUND THEM,

22:41.628 --> 22:43.062
GET A--GET A RELATIVE
TO DONATE.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.096
WHICH RELATIVE?

22:44.130 --> 22:44.964
THE SISTER
WHO WALKED AWAY

22:44.997 --> 22:46.733
AND TOLD YOU SHE WAS
NEVER COMING BACK?

22:46.766 --> 22:47.634
WE CAUSED THIS,
YOU KNOW.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.502
THEY WERE ESTRANGED,
BUT WE MADE IT WORSE.

22:49.536 --> 22:50.603
THAT RELATIONSHIP
WAS BROKEN

22:50.637 --> 22:52.805
LONG BEFORE
WE GOT THERE.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.741
NADIA LITERALLY
KEEPS SCORE.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.843
SHE TALLIES EVERYTHING.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.045
SHE DECIDED ELENA'S DONE MORE
BAD THINGS TO HER THAN GOOD,

22:59.078 --> 23:00.913
DOESN'T DESERVE
HER AFFECTION.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.381
I'M SURE SHE'S RIGHT.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.654
UNLIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
IN THE WORLD,

23:07.687 --> 23:08.788
HER MEMORY SEEMS
TO LET HER KEEP

23:08.821 --> 23:12.058
A PURE AND OBJECTIVE VIEW
OF PEOPLE AND RELATIONSHIPS.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.893
THERE'S NO PETTY
EMOTIONS OR AGENDAS

23:13.926 --> 23:14.794
FOGGING THE WINDSHIELD.

23:14.827 --> 23:15.828
WHY IS THAT SO WRONG?

23:15.862 --> 23:17.764
'CAUSE IT'S
MAKING HER DIE ALONE

23:17.797 --> 23:18.931
OF KIDNEY FAILURE
IN ROOM 205?

23:18.965 --> 23:19.999
NOT NECESSARILY.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.601
NADIA'S SISTER'S
NOT LIKE HER.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.736
I'M SURE SHE'S GOT PLENTY
OF SUBJECTIVE EMOTIONS

23:23.770 --> 23:24.804
WE CAN EXPLOIT.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.205
WHY DON'T YOU GO
CHANNEL YOUR GUILT,

23:26.238 --> 23:27.840
SEE IF YOU CAN GET HER
TO COUGH UP A KIDNEY?

23:27.874 --> 23:29.676
ME?

23:29.709 --> 23:30.743
I'M NOT GOOD
AT THAT TYPE OF THING.

23:30.777 --> 23:31.778
SOMEONE ELSE SHOULD GO.

23:31.811 --> 23:34.447
SOMEONE ELSE
DIDN'T SCREW THIS UP.

23:34.481 --> 23:35.748
I DIDN'T!

23:35.782 --> 23:37.684
YOU WERE JUST
OBEYING ORDERS, RIGHT?

23:37.717 --> 23:39.486
GO FIX THIS.

23:40.587 --> 23:41.654
WHA--

23:46.626 --> 23:48.928
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO MAKE YOU HATE HER.

23:48.961 --> 23:52.732
AND...NOW THAT HER
KIDNEYS HAVE FAILED, I--

23:54.200 --> 23:57.904
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BOOK
AND EQUATIONS PERSON.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.707
PEOPLE ARE PROBLEMATIC.

24:00.740 --> 24:04.511
AND...RANDOM AND MESSY.

24:04.544 --> 24:07.680
UM, AND WITH SISTERS...

24:07.714 --> 24:09.482
I MEAN, I HAD A COUSIN

24:09.516 --> 24:10.950
WHO I WAS CLOSE TO,

24:10.983 --> 24:12.519
AND WHEN OUR
MENSTRUAL CYCLES SYNCED,

24:12.552 --> 24:14.887
IT WAS LIKE
GLADIATOR SCHOOL--

24:14.921 --> 24:17.657
DO YOU WANT ME TO DONATE
A KIDNEY TO MY SISTER?

24:18.891 --> 24:19.892
YES.

24:22.695 --> 24:23.696
OKAY.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.965
REALLY?

24:25.998 --> 24:29.836
IT MIGHT NOT FIX
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.170
UH, PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.905
(Foreman)
YOUR LEFT, ON YOUR LEFT.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.006
(Taub)
STOP WHINING ALREADY.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.908
I WAS GETTING A SNIPER.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.143
FIVE MINUTES LEFT
IN THE BREAK.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.812
BUT THE NEXT LEVEL'S
JUST PAST THE COOLING TANKS.

24:39.846 --> 24:40.813
THAT WAS THE DEAL.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.048
WE TAKE THIS BREAK,
YOU DO A PRACTICE TEST.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.850
[laser blasts]

24:43.883 --> 24:47.620
[electronic screeching]

24:47.654 --> 24:50.890
I-I DIDN'T
HAVE THE FLU.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.526
I JUST...CHOKED.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.963
[electronic screeching,
laser blasts]

24:56.996 --> 24:59.566
[game shuts off]

24:59.599 --> 25:01.968
YOU MAKE LIFE AND DEATH
DECISIONS

25:02.001 --> 25:03.803
EVERY DAY.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.237
YOU WORK FOR HOUSE.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.707
YOU'RE UNDER CONSTANT PRESSURE,
AND YOU NEVER CHOKE.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.309
I GOT A PERFECT SCORE

25:10.342 --> 25:13.580
ON MY FIRST
PATHOLOGY BOARDS.

25:13.613 --> 25:16.883
I KEPT THINKING,
"WHATEVER MY SCORE IS NOW,

25:16.916 --> 25:19.986
"IT'S GOING TO BE A MEASURE
OF THE DISTANCE

25:20.019 --> 25:23.322
BETWEEN ME AND THE MAN
I USED TO BE."

25:23.355 --> 25:25.558
YOU GOTTA STOP
PSYCHING YOURSELF OUT.

25:25.592 --> 25:26.993
WELL, THE LAST TEST

25:27.026 --> 25:30.563
WAS BEFORE I LOST MY WIFE
AND MY HOME,

25:30.597 --> 25:33.766
SO I'M SURE THE NEXT ONE
WILL GO MUCH BETTER.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.980
[laser blasts]

25:48.014 --> 25:50.182
SOMETIMES, I WAKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

25:50.216 --> 25:52.318
AND I CAN'T SLEEP
FOR HOURS

25:52.351 --> 25:54.821
'CAUSE I'M WORRIED I GOT
THE DIAGNOSIS WRONG.

25:58.157 --> 25:59.992
THESE THINGS WORK OUT.

26:08.868 --> 26:11.938
WE FOUND A DONOR.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.940
IT'S YOUR SISTER.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.843
JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

26:50.009 --> 26:53.245

26:53.279 --> 26:55.014
YOU'RE COMING OUT
OF YOUR ANESTHESIA.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.016
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
A BIT GROGGY.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.219
YOU DID GREAT.

27:00.252 --> 27:02.789
EVERYTHING'S LOOKING GOOD.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.156

OPEN YOUR EYES.

OF LORAZEPAM,

27:11.097 --> 27:12.264

TO NEED SUCTION.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.768
[rapid beeping]

27:19.038 --> 27:20.707
SEIZURES MEAN THE STEROIDS
AREN'T WORKING.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.741
AND WE GOT
THE TESTS BACK.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.342
WE WERE WRONG.
IT'S NOT AUTOIMMUNE.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.977
COULD BE ACUTE PORPHYRIA.

27:25.011 --> 27:26.813
NO ABDOMINAL PAIN.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.849
DID THE PATIENT
THANK HER SISTER?

27:29.882 --> 27:31.784
NO.

27:31.818 --> 27:32.785
NOT YET, AT LEAST.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.053
SEE IF SHE WILL.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.054
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO FIND OUT?

27:35.087 --> 27:36.288
IF SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.291
SHE CLAIMS SHE OBJECTIVELY
SEES REALITY.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.860
WEIGHING THE GOOD
AND BAD IN PEOPLE.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.194
IF THAT'S TRUE,

27:42.228 --> 27:43.429
I DON'T CARE
HOW MANY TIMES HER SISTER

27:43.462 --> 27:45.364
BORROWED HER SCRUNCHIE
WITHOUT ASKING,

27:45.397 --> 27:47.734
A FREE KIDNEY OUGHT
TO TRUMP ALL THE BAD STUFF.

27:47.767 --> 27:48.701
AND IF IT DOESN'T?

27:48.735 --> 27:51.270
THAT MEANS SHE SUCKS,
LIKE THE REST OF US.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.772
WE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED
HER BLOOD.

27:52.805 --> 27:55.107
CLOTS COULD HIT HER LEG,
HEART, KIDNEY, AND BRAIN.

27:55.141 --> 27:56.275
FACTOR V LEIDEN.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.444
EASIEST TO TREAT,
IF WE'RE RIGHT.

27:58.477 --> 28:00.112
START HER ON HEPARIN.
[clatter]

28:00.146 --> 28:02.148
AND ASK FOR THE THANK-YOU.

28:04.817 --> 28:07.219
HOW'D I DO?

28:07.253 --> 28:08.821
GREAT.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.189
GREAT?

28:10.222 --> 28:11.323
HOW GREAT?

28:11.357 --> 28:12.324
HOW MANY DID I MISS?

28:12.358 --> 28:13.392
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE NUMBERS.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.393
DON'T...

28:14.426 --> 28:16.062
54%?

28:16.095 --> 28:17.463
TH-THEY MAKE
THE PRACTICE TESTS

28:17.496 --> 28:18.497
HARDER THAN
THE ACTUAL EXAM.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.967
OH, MY GOD, NOW I'M CHOKING
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.468
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

28:22.501 --> 28:23.803
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

28:23.836 --> 28:24.837
I FOUND THE GUY.

28:24.871 --> 28:27.473
HE CAN SELL ME A COPY
OF THE TEST.

28:27.506 --> 28:28.875
I KNOW IT'S CHEATING,

28:28.908 --> 28:31.143
AND I SUCK AS A PERSON.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.846
BUT...THE TEST
IS TOMORROW MORNING.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.182
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CHEATING.
IT'S ABOUT YOUR CONFIDENCE.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.518
YOU STEAL THAT TEST,
AND YOU'LL NEVER GET IT BACK.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.419
I CAN'T HANDLE

28:40.452 --> 28:42.955
FAILING AT ONE MORE THING
IN MY LIFE.

28:44.891 --> 28:47.026
YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.360
I'VE SEEN WHAT
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.296
YOU'RE FAST, YOU'RE DECISIVE,
AND YOU'RE BOLD.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.298
AND THOSE ARE NOT
THE QUALITIES OF SOMEONE

28:52.331 --> 28:53.933
WHO NEEDS TO STEAL A TEST.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.868
THERE'S NOTHING ON IT
THAT YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.137
YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW IT.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.271
KEEP TALKING.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.841
WE NEED YOU ON THE TEAM.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.176
SO WE'RE GONNA SIT HERE
AND TAKE ANOTHER PRACTICE TEST

29:04.210 --> 29:05.244
AND WE'RE GONNA
KEEP TAKING THEM

29:05.277 --> 29:07.279
UNTIL YOU'VE
KICKED ITS ASS!

29:07.313 --> 29:10.316
YOU CAN DO THIS!
YOU FEEL ME?

29:10.349 --> 29:11.818
[hoarse]
YEAH.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.174
I FEEL LIKE WE JUST
BURIED A HOOKER IN THE DESERT.

29:35.207 --> 29:36.475
THERE'LL DEFINITELY
BE ANOTHER TIME

29:36.508 --> 29:38.210
TO RISE UP
AND TURN THINGS AROUND.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.278
YOU'LL COME BACK FROM IT.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.013
NEXT TIME.

29:48.855 --> 29:51.858
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

29:51.891 --> 29:54.827
[raspy]
N-NOT ANY BETTER.

29:54.861 --> 29:58.130
IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME
FOR THE CLOTS TO RESOLVE.

29:58.164 --> 30:01.467
YOUR SISTER'S
RECOVERING WELL.

30:01.500 --> 30:05.037
IF YOU'RE REALLY ADDING UP
THE GOOD AND BAD...

30:09.876 --> 30:10.977
[whispers]
CAN I SEE HER?

30:13.880 --> 30:15.181
(House)
TOO FAT.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.016
TOO THIN.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.450
TOO DESPERATE.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.419
NOT DESPERATE ENOUGH.

30:20.452 --> 30:23.089
COME ON, YOU CAN
INSULT THEM TOO.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.391
I'D RATHER NOT.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.893
IF YOU OBJECTIFY THEM NOW,

30:26.926 --> 30:28.627
YOU'LL FEEL MORE
COMFORTABLE WHEN YOU...

30:28.660 --> 30:31.898
TIE THEM TO A TABLE
IN YOUR BASEMENT LATER.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.233
OR WHATEVER.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.068
OKAY.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.536
UM...

30:37.569 --> 30:39.238
TOO ARMPIT FATTY.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.010

I ACTUALLY KNOW HER.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.212
SHE'S THE NEW BARISTA
AT MY COFFEE SHOP.

30:46.245 --> 30:47.546
SHE'S GETTING HER MASTERS
IN FINANCE.

30:48.948 --> 30:49.949

30:49.982 --> 30:51.984
TOTAL MORON
AS A BARISTA, THOUGH.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.052
EVERY DRINK I ORDER

30:53.085 --> 30:54.186
ENDS UP WITH
WHIPPED CREAM ON IT.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.022
EVEN WHEN I SAY NO WHIP.

30:56.055 --> 31:01.127
GIRLFRIEND, THAT MEANS
SHE'S INTO YOU.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.594
OKAY.

31:15.107 --> 31:15.874
I'M HOPING THAT'S
ENOUGH TO CLOSE,

31:15.908 --> 31:18.010
BECAUSE I'M ALSO
A SOCIAL MORON.

THANK YOU.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.368
FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.570
I LOVE YOU, YOU KNOW.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.643
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THOSE TIMES

32:24.676 --> 32:27.246
WE WENT UP TO SPOFFORD LAKE
IN THE SUMMER.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.715
[chuckles]

32:29.748 --> 32:30.983
WHENEVER WE TOOK OUT
THE CANOE,

32:31.017 --> 32:33.119
YOU'D TIE UP
MY LIFE VEST FOR ME.

32:33.152 --> 32:36.122
IN THE AFTERNOON,
SNEAK ME INTO THE LODGE

32:36.155 --> 32:37.589
SO WE COULD STEAL POPSICLES.

32:37.623 --> 32:40.726
[chuckles]

32:40.759 --> 32:43.729
MAYBE WE COULD GO BACK.

32:43.762 --> 32:46.765
I COULD DRIVE US UP THERE.
WE COULD GET A CABIN AND--

32:46.798 --> 32:50.736
[giggling]
AND MAYBE RENT A CANOE.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.471
OH, WOW, I HAVEN'T...

32:52.504 --> 32:54.206
THOUGHT OF SPOFFORD IN...

32:56.508 --> 32:57.543
NADIA...

32:57.576 --> 33:00.512
ARE YOU OKAY?

33:00.546 --> 33:03.415
ELENA, I'M SORRY!
I CAN'T DO THIS!

33:17.696 --> 33:18.764
CAN YOU STOP?

33:18.797 --> 33:20.566
JUST STOP PUSHING ME
FOR A MINUTE.

33:26.072 --> 33:28.040
I UNDERSTAND NOW

33:28.074 --> 33:30.076
WHY YOU STUCK YOURSELF
IN THAT DINER,

33:30.109 --> 33:33.112
AWAY FROM FRIENDS,
AWAY FROM FAMILY.

33:35.114 --> 33:38.117
YOU CAN'T FORGIVE ANYONE.

33:38.150 --> 33:40.052
I DON'T THINK
YOU WEIGH ANYTHING.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.653
I THINK YOU'RE LIKE
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.090
YOU FOCUS ON
THE BAD MEMORIES

33:44.123 --> 33:46.325
INSTEAD OF THE GOOD.

33:46.358 --> 33:49.295
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

33:52.664 --> 33:55.601
NADIA, PUT YOUR HAND
IN YOUR LAP FOR A MOMENT.

33:59.171 --> 34:01.407
I'M NOT DOING THAT.
I KNOW.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.143
IT'S AN INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENT
CALLED CHOREIA.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.744
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

34:05.777 --> 34:08.347
IT MEANS WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.

34:12.318 --> 34:14.320
[ball thudding]

34:19.791 --> 34:21.527
THANK YOU.

34:24.296 --> 34:28.367
DO YOU KNOW IF THAT...
O.R. NURSE THAT WILSON LIKED

34:28.400 --> 34:30.469
EVER BROKE UP
WITH HER BOYFRIEND?

34:30.502 --> 34:32.371
I THOUGHT YOUR WILSON FETISH
WAS OVER.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.273
I'M PUTTING TOGETHER
A SECOND STRING

34:34.306 --> 34:35.607
IN CASE THINGS
DON'T GO WELL

34:35.641 --> 34:37.276
WITH THE WELL-BREASTED
BARISTA.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.345
YOU'VE GOTTA
LET THAT GUY ALONE.

34:39.378 --> 34:42.281
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE ALONE.

34:42.314 --> 34:43.449
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

34:43.482 --> 34:44.683
YOU FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE

34:44.716 --> 34:48.287
WILSON'S THE ONE
THAT'S ALONE AND NOT YOU?

34:48.320 --> 34:50.222
YOU STILL DON'T THINK
YOU DESERVE THIS.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.325
HAVE YOU MET ME?

34:53.359 --> 34:56.895
YOUR HAPPINESS
DOESN'T TAKE HIS AWAY.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.864
IT'S OKAY TO ENJOY IT.
[cell phone ringing]

35:05.271 --> 35:06.172
YEAH.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.307
CHOREIA. RULES OUT
THE CLOTTING DISORDER.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.575
MEANS WE'RE BACK
TO SQUARE ONE.

35:09.608 --> 35:10.742
IF IT'S HIT
HER BRAIN,

35:10.776 --> 35:12.211
THAT COULD MEAN
SHE DOESN'T HAVE LONG.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.912
SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES,

35:13.945 --> 35:15.581
WILL THE SISTER
SHOW UP AT THE FUNERAL?

35:15.614 --> 35:17.349
SHE TRIED TO RECONCILE,

35:17.383 --> 35:19.685
BUT THE BAD MEMORIES CROWDED OUT
THE GOOD, AND SHE RAN.

35:19.718 --> 35:20.752
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.488
WHAT ELSE?

35:24.490 --> 35:27.426
COME ON, THE WOMAN HAS
ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.895
SHE'S A BOTTOMLESS
DIAGNOSTIC LIBRARY.

35:29.928 --> 35:32.264
MAYBE WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING
FROM THE APARTMENT.

35:32.298 --> 35:33.399
SOME LIFESTYLE THING.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.666
YEAH, IT'S ALL
MUSCLE STRAIN

35:34.700 --> 35:36.768
FROM DOING HER HUNDREDS
OF JIGSAW PUZZLES.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.404
WE SHOULD DO
ANOTHER MRI.

35:38.437 --> 35:39.405
A BRAIN HEMORRHAGE WOULD--

35:39.438 --> 35:41.440
HEY.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.441
HOW MANY PUZZLES?

35:42.474 --> 35:44.310
OKAY, I WAS EXAGGERATING.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.444
DOZENS.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.481
DO A PERIPHERAL BLOOD SMEAR.

35:49.515 --> 35:50.582
LOOK FOR ACANTHOCYTES.

35:50.616 --> 35:51.950
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.756
REMEMBER ME?

35:57.789 --> 35:59.658
JUST KIDDING.

35:59.691 --> 36:02.894
SO...JIGSAW PUZZLES.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.932
UM, I FIND THEM CALMING.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.201
(House)
YOU EVER LEFT ONE UNFINISHED?

36:09.235 --> 36:11.970
NO, THAT WOULD
DRIVE ME CRAZY.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.905
SPEAKING OF...

36:20.679 --> 36:21.847
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THAT?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.982
MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION IS,
WHY ARE YOU?

36:24.015 --> 36:25.251
IT'S JUST A HABIT.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.319
IT'S A HABIT
THAT COMPELS YOU

36:27.353 --> 36:29.988
IN AN OBSESSIVE WAY

36:30.021 --> 36:31.923
THAT'S SO BAD,
IT'S A DISORDER.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.492
I DON'T HAVE OCD.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.593
EACH BRAIN WITH OCD

36:34.626 --> 36:36.295
HAS ITS OWN WAY
OF FILTERING IT.

36:36.328 --> 36:37.596
SOME PEOPLE
WASH THEIR HANDS

36:37.629 --> 36:38.964
AND HOARD TV GUIDES.

36:38.997 --> 36:42.468
YOU DO PUZZLES
AND HOARD MEMORIES.

36:42.501 --> 36:46.272
SO WHAT WE THOUGHT
WAS A GIFT...

36:46.305 --> 36:51.510
IS JUST YOU LITERALLY
OBSESSING OVER YOUR OWN LIFE.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.312
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T
STOP THE MEMORIES,

36:53.345 --> 36:54.913
EVEN WHEN I TRY.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.584
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE?

36:58.617 --> 36:59.751
MY KIDNEYS?

36:59.785 --> 37:02.020
MEMORY WAS JUST
A SYMPTOM OF A SYMPTOM

37:02.053 --> 37:04.323
OF A LARGER DISEASE.

37:04.356 --> 37:05.491
YOU HAVE MCLEOD SYNDROME.

37:05.524 --> 37:06.892
IT'S A RARE
GENETIC DISORDER

37:06.925 --> 37:09.895
THAT AFFECTS
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, THE BLOOD.

37:09.928 --> 37:13.965
AND CAN CAUSE...

37:13.999 --> 37:16.668
OCD.

37:18.770 --> 37:19.871
AM I GONNA DIE?

37:19.905 --> 37:21.873
IT CAN'T BE CURED.

37:21.907 --> 37:26.278
BUT YOUR VARIOUS SYMPTOMS
CAN BE MANAGED WITH MEDICATION.

37:30.015 --> 37:30.982
BEST-CASE SCENARIO,

37:31.016 --> 37:32.484
YOU CAN LIVE
ANOTHER 20 YEARS.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.626
IF IT'S ANY SOLACE,

37:40.659 --> 37:42.994
EVERYBODY DIES ALONE.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.568
IT PROBABLY ISN'T.

37:57.909 --> 38:00.078
HOW'D IT GO?

38:00.111 --> 38:01.447
WELL, IT'S HARD TO CHOKE

38:01.480 --> 38:03.982
WHEN YOU HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.050
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.052
IT'S BETTER TO SUCK
AT TAKING ONE TEST

38:07.085 --> 38:10.021
THAN TO SUCK AT
SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.590
WOW.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.592
(Taub)
UH, RACHEL THOUGHT
IT WAS TOO BIG,

38:13.625 --> 38:14.960
AND I CAN'T KEEP IT
IN MY HOTEL ROOM.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.095
YOU'RE GIVING IT TO ME?

38:17.128 --> 38:18.497
I COULDN'T
STAND THE THOUGHT

38:18.530 --> 38:20.599
OF YOU HAVING COMPANY OVER

38:20.632 --> 38:21.833
WITH THAT OTHER TV.

38:21.867 --> 38:23.369
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

38:25.604 --> 38:26.605
THANKS.

38:28.006 --> 38:30.909
THANK YOU.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.917
HEY, LOOK, UM...

38:38.950 --> 38:40.752
I HAVE THE ROOM.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.521
YOU COULD STAY,
IF YOU WANTED TO.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.923
JUST UNTIL YOU
FIND YOUR NEW PLACE.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.693
WHO ELSE AM I GONNA PLAY
SAVAGESKATE WITH?

38:47.726 --> 38:51.430
WE COULD DO THAT ONLINE
FROM SEPARATE HOUSES.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.798
WILL YOU SHUT UP?

38:53.899 --> 38:55.401
OKAY.

39:03.409 --> 39:04.543
HOW YOU FEELING?

39:04.576 --> 39:07.513
[sighs]
MUCH BETTER.

39:07.546 --> 39:10.649
I DON'T BELIEVE
WHAT HOUSE SAID.

39:10.682 --> 39:14.686
I'M NOT SURE EVEN HOUSE
BELIEVES IT ANYMORE.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.122
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE

39:17.155 --> 39:19.558
TO BE THE WAY YOU ARE.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.393
NOW YOU DO.

39:21.427 --> 39:22.994
THESE ARE SSRIs.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.597
THEY'VE BEEN EFFECTIVE
IN TREATING OCD.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.132
YOU MEAN LOSE MY MEMORY?

39:27.165 --> 39:28.500
NOT LOSE IT ENTIRELY.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.502
IT'LL JUST BECOME
MORE LIKE ANYONE ELSE'S.

39:33.104 --> 39:36.508
MY MEMORY...

39:36.542 --> 39:37.909
IS THE ONLY THING

39:37.943 --> 39:41.513
THAT HAS EVER
MADE ME SPECIAL.

39:42.648 --> 39:44.883
MAYBE SO.

39:44.916 --> 39:48.487
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO BE SPECIAL...

39:48.520 --> 39:51.623
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO BE ALONE.

40:10.676 --> 40:11.677
OHH!

40:21.953 --> 40:23.154
OHH!

40:28.026 --> 40:29.027
HEY.
AAH!

40:30.261 --> 40:31.963
THOSE ARE FOR SARAH.

40:31.997 --> 40:33.799
ARE THEY POISONED?

40:33.832 --> 40:35.734
POI--

40:35.767 --> 40:37.803
YOU AND YOUR PARANOIA.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.738
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME...

40:39.771 --> 40:41.507
[grunting]

40:42.874 --> 40:44.676
I REALLY SHOULD FIND
A BETTER PLACE

40:44.710 --> 40:47.513
TO STORE MY RAGWEED.

40:47.546 --> 40:48.614
IT'S A VERY NICE GESTURE,

40:48.647 --> 40:50.148
BUT IT'S STILL
IN THE APARTMENT.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.668
SO...I WANNA HEAR

41:09.701 --> 41:12.638
ALL THE DIRTY,
DAIRY-SPECIFIC DETAILS

41:12.671 --> 41:14.806
OF YOUR NIGHT
WITH JAVA THE SLUT.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.675
ALL RIGHT.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.710
FIRST OF ALL,

41:18.744 --> 41:19.711
ALL REAL.

41:19.745 --> 41:21.580
SECOND...

41:21.613 --> 41:24.082
A TRUE CONNOISSEUR

41:24.115 --> 41:26.718
OF THE DARK ARTS OF...

41:29.821 --> 41:30.722
I FLAKED.

41:30.756 --> 41:33.058
I WALKED HER TO HER CAR
AND SAID GOOD NIGHT.

41:33.091 --> 41:35.694
I WILL GET BACK INTO IT, I--

41:35.727 --> 41:38.263
YOU JUST NEED TO GIVE ME
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

41:44.603 --> 41:47.205
I'LL GIVE YOU TEN DAYS.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.779
FINE.

41:56.748 --> 41:59.885
[cat screeching]

41:59.918 --> 42:00.986
OOH.
