02:11.292 --> 02:12.833
Let's go.
Letters are fading.

02:13.042 --> 02:15.000
Where's talent?
We have 5 seconds.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.875
- And the letters?
- It's fine.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.042
Did you get that in shot?

02:19.292 --> 02:20.792
Okay, where's Hal?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.417
I can only hold it
a few seconds.

02:23.625 --> 02:26.583
Get the first team on set.
The letters are fading.

02:26.792 --> 02:28.292
Come on, we gotta go!

02:28.500 --> 02:30.083
- She looks great. Come!
- I'm ready.

02:30.333 --> 02:31.708
- Please.
- Let's go.

02:31.917 --> 02:33.333
Quick review, Nicole.

02:33.625 --> 02:36.000
Get out of the
car, run across...

02:36.250 --> 02:37.917
you see the
skywriting, "Help"...

02:38.125 --> 02:39.792
and realise everything's
gone wrong.

02:40.042 --> 02:42.625
It's incredible.
You had it all figured out.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.833
And now it's all chaos.

02:45.083 --> 02:47.667
You need to
project despair.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.792
- We gotta go. We're losing...
- I know.

02:51.083 --> 02:54.667
Make me feel the
whole human condition.

02:54.917 --> 02:56.417
- You know?
- Lock it up!

03:00.542 --> 03:03.208
Can you stop the drill
for 5 minutes?

03:03.500 --> 03:04.750
What's that, "Help"?

03:05.083 --> 03:06.917
- Roll camera!
- Camera's rolling.

03:07.208 --> 03:08.583
- Speed!
- Higher.

03:08.792 --> 03:10.875
Scene 121, take 1!

03:11.625 --> 03:12.667
Action!

03:15.042 --> 03:17.417
Faster, faster.

03:17.708 --> 03:19.458
You're like a zombie!

03:19.667 --> 03:22.250
Okay, hit the mark.
Look up.

03:22.583 --> 03:25.167
Come on, come on.
And good, good.

03:25.375 --> 03:26.625
Cut! We cut!

03:27.000 --> 03:29.042
Nicole, thank you.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.458
That was amazing.
So compelling.

03:31.708 --> 03:35.250
Your body language, it's
so emotional, everything you do.

03:35.458 --> 03:38.750
You get the big bucks because
you make me look great.

03:38.958 --> 03:41.417
Camp David here.
About the ring.

03:41.625 --> 03:43.000
Mary, here's Nicole.

03:45.208 --> 03:48.250
- Sorry to bug you.
- Okay, pal.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.375
- Do I sign the thing?
- Voucher.

03:50.583 --> 03:51.417
Sure.

03:51.625 --> 03:53.042
You get a voucher?

03:53.292 --> 03:55.042
- Did they get it?
- Let's hope.

03:55.250 --> 03:57.875
Our wardrobe, right?
John, take this.

03:58.083 --> 04:01.167
Where do I know you from?
I know you, right?

04:01.500 --> 04:02.458
Thanks.

04:03.458 --> 04:06.292
Chippers in So-Ho.
I waited on you.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.250
What a great memory!

04:08.500 --> 04:11.292
It was a couple
of months ago, right?

04:11.500 --> 04:14.083
But I remembered your face.

04:14.708 --> 04:16.375
And you're an actress.

04:16.583 --> 04:17.750
I'm an extra.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.416
A face in the crowd.

04:19.708 --> 04:21.583
I'll get my sweatshirt.

04:24.083 --> 04:25.917
When do you finish work?

04:28.667 --> 04:32.000
Was that gorgeous black girl
you came with your girlfriend?

04:32.792 --> 04:36.125
It was a guy in drag!
What are you talking about?

04:36.458 --> 04:38.875
- Gorgeous girlfriend?
- Beautiful, whatever it was.

04:39.083 --> 04:41.917
I was writing a
piece on transvestites...

04:42.125 --> 04:44.958
which is why you saw my
"gorgeous girlfriend".

04:45.167 --> 04:47.458
Well if you ever come back...

04:47.667 --> 04:49.625
I get off around midnight.

04:55.208 --> 04:56.500
You need a...

04:57.833 --> 04:59.833
Excuse me, can I borrow...?

05:00.917 --> 05:02.792
Tell me how close I am.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.292
You're from rich parents...

05:05.542 --> 05:09.042
you see a shrink and
you're dyslexic, right?

05:09.292 --> 05:10.375
Thanks.

05:12.292 --> 05:14.375
- That was good.
- I try.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.250
My father's wealthy...

05:16.500 --> 05:18.167
I do see a shrink...

05:18.375 --> 05:21.750
and I'm insomniac,
so you're in the ballpark.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.500
I remember you had
an amazing look.

05:24.708 --> 05:26.667
And I thought,
"Trouble for someone."

05:26.875 --> 05:28.792
I think I dreamt about you.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.708
Really, I remember
your face.

05:30.917 --> 05:32.292
Who wouldn't?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.250
Please, sign your voucher.

05:38.167 --> 05:39.167
Thanks.

05:43.792 --> 05:45.708
- Lee!
- Excuse me.

05:45.917 --> 05:46.875
Over here.

05:47.208 --> 05:50.458
Sandy, you'll send the
truffles to the president, right?

05:50.708 --> 05:53.542
Tomorrow at 7, okay?
In the park.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.083
- Thanks.
- Here he is.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.125
Sorry.
Ready for our tête-à-tête?

05:58.375 --> 06:00.625
Absolutely.
Everything in hand.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.458
- Bill Gaines.
- How are you?

06:02.667 --> 06:04.250
Nicole's press agent.

06:04.458 --> 06:07.167
Please, let's not
dwell on the bulimia.

06:07.375 --> 06:10.417
Believe me, Bill,
this is about lots of things.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.625
You said you'd show me
where you grew up.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.083
I did, I promised.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.375
It's great we could do this.
Makes a big difference.

06:28.583 --> 06:30.875
So kind of you
to show me.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.583
This stuff makes a
lot of people nervous.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.000
Sorry to disturb you.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.292
This lady lived here...

06:45.292 --> 06:47.125
as a child, years ago.

06:47.375 --> 06:50.000
Nicole Oliver. You must know
her. Great actress.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.500
What d'you want?

06:51.750 --> 06:54.750
He's writing an article
about me...

06:54.958 --> 06:57.083
and I'd like to show him
where I used to live.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.875
Five minutes. It'd be
great for the magazine.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.417
Come in and look around.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.500
- I appreciate it.
- Thank you.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.042
Look how tiny her feet are.

07:07.292 --> 07:09.250
Like, this is
where it all began.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.542
Did you have
feet like that, too?

07:15.083 --> 07:16.750
Strange for you, I guess.

07:17.458 --> 07:20.208
- It's changed, I think.
- I hope so.

07:20.458 --> 07:22.042
It feels smaller.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.500
Small?
That often happens.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.625
How long have you lived here?

07:27.375 --> 07:30.208
Never mind. Can
we go upstairs?

07:30.417 --> 07:32.042
- Terrific.
- Whatever you want.

07:32.292 --> 07:33.917
- Is that okay?
- She said okay.

07:34.125 --> 07:36.250
- I don't care.
- Great. Thank you.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.750
I had this whole wall
plastered...

07:42.125 --> 07:46.042
with movie star photos. I dreamt
about being in a movie...

07:47.333 --> 07:48.750
with Warren Beatty.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.708
You had nice dreams.

07:52.625 --> 07:56.708
And I'd lie on the bed naked
and watch my body develop.

07:58.292 --> 07:59.167
"Naked..."

07:59.417 --> 08:01.083
And I prayed that...

08:01.667 --> 08:04.708
my breasts and legs
would be beautiful...

08:04.958 --> 08:07.250
so I could be
an actress.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.667
You cut a very
erotic figure like that.

08:12.083 --> 08:13.708
I have to say it.

08:15.708 --> 08:18.250
Fortunately I matured quickly.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.750
I remember my brothers
spying on me...

08:22.000 --> 08:25.833
in the shower, or they
rubbed up against me.

08:27.583 --> 08:30.958
I empathise with them
totally. I really...

08:31.250 --> 08:32.250
Please.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.207
No?

08:34.707 --> 08:36.707
- Married.
- Happily?

08:36.917 --> 08:38.125
Very.

08:39.957 --> 08:41.917
But you have to work at it.

08:42.125 --> 08:45.000
You have to, if you want
fidelity in a relationship.

08:46.125 --> 08:50.042
But have you ever given
in to lust in this room...

08:50.292 --> 08:52.958
and really let
yourself go...

08:53.208 --> 08:54.458
in a big way?

08:57.667 --> 08:59.625
I can't sleep
with you.

08:59.833 --> 09:03.375
You can't, I know that.
But I had to...

09:04.208 --> 09:05.625
The proximity is...

09:05.958 --> 09:07.083
thrilling...

09:07.292 --> 09:08.875
and irresistible.

09:09.083 --> 09:12.292
- Not that you're not attractive.
- Very kind.

09:12.542 --> 09:14.417
I find you very attractive.

09:14.667 --> 09:18.458
But some things I won't do,
out of commitment.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.917
I hear you. You
don't have to...

09:21.125 --> 09:25.167
I only have intercourse
with my husband, Phil.

09:26.417 --> 09:28.583
My body belongs
to my husband.

09:28.792 --> 09:30.750
Listen, I understand...

09:31.125 --> 09:35.083
But from the neck up,
that's another story.

09:46.167 --> 09:50.167
After your nomination you formed
a production company, right?

09:50.417 --> 09:53.750
Right. You have to develop
your own projects.

09:53.958 --> 09:58.083
You can't imagine the
amount of crap I get sent.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.750
Plus, I'd really like
to direct one day.

10:00.958 --> 10:03.375
Really? Well,
I don't want to be pushy...

10:03.583 --> 10:06.667
but I've got a screenplay
I've written...

10:06.875 --> 10:09.083
and today I thought
it might be...

10:09.292 --> 10:11.917
you know, perfect
for you.

10:12.167 --> 10:15.458
Really. Right now
it's written for a man...

10:15.708 --> 10:19.708
but it could easily be
rewritten for a woman.

10:20.125 --> 10:21.208
What's it about?

10:21.417 --> 10:24.917
An armoured car robbery,
but with a personal crisis.

10:25.167 --> 10:28.875
- Who would I play?
- One of the guards.

10:29.375 --> 10:32.542
It needs a rewrite, with
a feminist statement.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.292
I know you're politically active...

10:34.500 --> 10:37.750
and I think it could
work so well.

10:37.958 --> 10:40.667
I've been working
on it for a year...

10:40.875 --> 10:43.667
and I can't progress
unless a star is involved.

10:43.917 --> 10:46.125
And someone like you, it'd be...

10:46.333 --> 10:48.375
Have you given it to
any actors?

10:48.583 --> 10:51.833
Yeah, but their agents reject
it before they see it...

10:52.042 --> 10:54.792
because I have no track
record as a screenwriter...

10:55.000 --> 10:58.375
although the script gets a
terrific reaction.

10:59.042 --> 11:01.833
- Let me think about it.
- Really?

11:02.125 --> 11:04.750
Great, because I don't want to...

11:05.125 --> 11:07.875
- But I think you'd enjoy it.
- Let me think about it.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.083
Sure.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.875
He's coming!
Come this way!

11:29.125 --> 11:30.542
Come this way, everyone!

11:30.750 --> 11:32.292
It's him. Come on.

11:32.833 --> 11:36.375
We watch you every
Sunday on TV!

11:36.708 --> 11:39.042
We wouldn't miss it
for the world!

11:39.250 --> 11:40.667
Good to see you.

11:40.875 --> 11:43.125
- Will you stay long?
- As long as I can.

11:43.333 --> 11:46.417
Father Gladden is
our guest, from the TV.

11:46.625 --> 11:50.292
Father, my daughter got a prize
at school for charity work.

11:50.542 --> 11:52.792
She'd love to have
your autograph.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.542
Entrance into the
Kingdom of God...

11:54.750 --> 11:58.042
is determined by our response
to the neighbour in need.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.042
I don't know what I'm doing here.

12:00.250 --> 12:03.083
Relax, I was the
same at first.

12:03.375 --> 12:07.083
My room's so spare.
And with a Bible!

12:07.417 --> 12:08.792
And the water comes out brown.

12:09.042 --> 12:12.333
I told the handyman. Really,
I know what you're going through.

12:12.583 --> 12:15.500
When my husband went off
with his secretary, I was lost.

12:15.750 --> 12:18.542
Someone said,
"You were raised a Catholic.

12:18.833 --> 12:22.750
How could you consider a hit man?"
And I heard about this retreat.

12:22.958 --> 12:24.625
- But I'm not religious.
- Nor am I.

12:24.833 --> 12:28.458
My life, religious? I've had
two divorces and two abortions.

12:28.792 --> 12:32.292
But to take a break from
the chaos of the city...

12:32.542 --> 12:33.750
No, no, no.

12:33.958 --> 12:36.250
The water comes out
brown in my room.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.417
And the bed's hard.

12:38.667 --> 12:42.458
You've had a trauma.
No therapy, no pills...

12:42.875 --> 12:44.750
what you need is peace and quiet.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.167
Your emotions
have to settle.

12:48.667 --> 12:52.167
I couldn't go back
to teaching again.

12:52.458 --> 12:53.667
Simplify.

12:54.042 --> 12:57.167
Who's more popular,
the Pope or Elvis?

12:57.417 --> 12:59.250
- I don't think there's any doubt...
- Elvis!

13:00.875 --> 13:04.375
Do you think that the Beatles,
at the height of their fame...

13:04.667 --> 13:06.583
were bigger stars than Jesus?

13:06.792 --> 13:09.750
- World population was smaller...
- Autograph, please?

13:10.250 --> 13:12.875
The food's the worst.
What is this?

13:13.083 --> 13:16.000
I don't know. Shoe leather?
You don't have to eat it.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.667
I asked for it rare.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.583
But you don't like meat.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.292
I said "rare".
You heard me.

13:22.542 --> 13:24.958
I told them twice.
"Not overdone."

13:25.167 --> 13:28.542
Well, we're not
here to enjoy ourselves.

13:29.833 --> 13:31.625
Eat it, or something else.

13:33.375 --> 13:37.292
- The macaroni cheese is good.
- Would you like mine? It's rare.

13:38.458 --> 13:40.875
- That's nice of you.
- Please!

13:41.167 --> 13:42.125
You sure?

13:43.500 --> 13:47.375
You see, I can't eat
steak that's not rare.

13:47.917 --> 13:49.792
Doesn't that look nice!

13:50.250 --> 13:51.875
I started as a hobby...

13:52.083 --> 13:55.417
but I get so many orders now,
I can't make them quick enough.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.375
All genuine ceramic.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.375
And this rubber
bulb here...

14:00.667 --> 14:04.417
that you fill with
washable red dye.

14:04.625 --> 14:08.042
One squeeze and His
wounds bleed. Watch that.

14:08.292 --> 14:09.708
Isn't that something?

14:10.792 --> 14:12.750
- Do you like the country?
- Oh, very much.

14:12.958 --> 14:15.625
I went to a Catholic school,
you know?

14:15.875 --> 14:18.708
So I have moments of
nostalgia for the faith.

14:20.417 --> 14:22.083
Let your soul wander.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.333
And if the miracles
of nature...

14:24.583 --> 14:27.708
lead to intimations of
something larger...

14:28.125 --> 14:30.792
try and have
an open heart.

14:31.708 --> 14:35.792
Are there ticks here?
I'd hate to get Lyme's disease.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.417
- No casualties so far.
- Good.

14:38.625 --> 14:40.125
Could you excuse me?

14:40.417 --> 14:41.708
Yes. Bye.

14:53.417 --> 14:54.708
<i>What, a divorce?</i>

14:55.000 --> 14:56.250
<i>A divorce.</i>

14:56.792 --> 14:59.000
- Try and understand.
- Why?

14:59.208 --> 15:02.708
It's not you, it's me.
I have to...

15:02.958 --> 15:04.875
- Pull over!
- Robin, we should...

15:05.083 --> 15:06.250
Pull the fucking car over!

15:06.500 --> 15:08.333
Jesus, will you calm down?

15:14.375 --> 15:17.542
Robin, where are you
going? That's not safe!

15:20.667 --> 15:22.708
Come on. Are you crazy?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.125
This is dangerous.
We can't talk here.

15:25.375 --> 15:26.833
You've met someone else?

15:27.917 --> 15:31.042
- I knew you'd think that.
- You have. You're lying.

15:31.292 --> 15:32.708
I haven't. Jesus!

15:33.000 --> 15:37.042
So after 16 fine years,
why a divorce?

15:38.458 --> 15:40.875
It's me. I'm confused.

15:41.083 --> 15:44.042
I want a different life, to
go in a different direction.

15:44.292 --> 15:46.458
- Confused? Then see a doctor.
- I did.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.000
Well, that's news!

15:49.208 --> 15:52.750
What other surprises
you got in store?

15:53.125 --> 15:54.917
This wasn't an easy decision.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.208
You've met someone.

15:57.417 --> 15:59.583
No-one just ups and goes.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.958
You know, we got
married so young.

16:02.167 --> 16:03.958
- Never time for living!
- Change your life how?

16:04.167 --> 16:05.958
All we know
is each other!

16:06.167 --> 16:08.500
So who do you want
to explore, Allison?

16:08.708 --> 16:10.083
Why Allison?

16:10.292 --> 16:13.875
- Your hands touched in the car.
- I don't believe this!

16:14.292 --> 16:16.875
And you didn't pull yours away!

16:17.083 --> 16:18.708
You had an affair with Allison!

16:18.917 --> 16:20.750
- Our neighbour!
- Not an affair!

16:21.000 --> 16:23.792
- You slept with her!
- That's why I want a divorce!

16:24.000 --> 16:25.583
To marry Allison?

16:26.583 --> 16:29.000
I can't be dishonest,
and I have been...

16:29.500 --> 16:31.417
and I don't want to do it.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.042
- Who else?
- Nobody else.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.375
Lee, tell me...

16:41.250 --> 16:43.583
now we're clearing the air.

16:43.875 --> 16:45.750
I won't get angry.

16:46.042 --> 16:47.375
Lee, come on.

16:49.417 --> 16:50.958
Let's clear the air.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.958
I won't get angry.

16:54.417 --> 16:55.708
Aren't you cold?

16:55.958 --> 16:57.542
We're clearing the air.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.708
I'm not gonna get angry.

17:03.708 --> 17:05.000
Sheila...

17:06.375 --> 17:07.458
Sheila?

17:09.583 --> 17:12.291
You lowlife
motherfucker!

17:12.541 --> 17:14.958
- I can't talk to you!
- My best friend, Sheila!

17:15.166 --> 17:18.500
It's not about women. I'm
depressed about my whole life.

17:18.750 --> 17:19.958
Your life with me?

17:20.166 --> 17:22.583
I hate these stupid
travel pieces!

17:22.791 --> 17:25.916
I tried to talk to you before,
but you're so high-strung.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.500
I mean, we
can't talk!

17:28.750 --> 17:30.958
It's over, you know?
I'm not happy!

17:35.000 --> 17:36.792
Robin, are you okay?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.750
Robin, are you okay?

17:40.625 --> 17:41.500
No.

17:42.083 --> 17:43.583
But I will be.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.292
Do you try to shock people?

18:52.708 --> 18:56.750
One of my best collections.
I'm pleased how it turned out.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.708
I'd love to talk
about this location.

19:03.917 --> 19:05.875
We'll definitely get together.

19:06.083 --> 19:07.625
It's an inspired idea!

19:11.917 --> 19:14.125
The skyline enhances
my collection.

19:14.667 --> 19:16.167
The colour's great, isn't it?

19:16.375 --> 19:18.917
A fantastic backdrop
for your work.

19:19.542 --> 19:22.208
It'd be great to talk
more about this.

19:22.417 --> 19:23.833
Come next week.

19:24.042 --> 19:26.292
We'll have lunch and I'll
show you round.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.833
Can we talk more now?

19:28.042 --> 19:30.833
- It'd help me with the details.
- Sure, no problem.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.667
Nice car.

20:04.708 --> 20:07.250
Thanks. Want
to drive it?

20:07.500 --> 20:09.917
- Because it's a terrific...
- Is it yours?

20:10.208 --> 20:11.792
Sure. What am I, a car thief?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.833
It's an Aston Martin.

20:14.708 --> 20:16.792
You're welcome, come on.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.333
You've got a wig, it's...

20:19.625 --> 20:21.042
- Camouflage.
- Really?

20:21.958 --> 20:23.375
- Give me the keys.
- Thank you.

20:23.625 --> 20:26.000
You look so much
longer-haired.

20:27.208 --> 20:28.542
Got enough room?

20:32.750 --> 20:35.292
Not too fast, the
steering's a little...

20:37.958 --> 20:39.250
Like flying a plane.

20:39.500 --> 20:43.417
Yeah, a 1967 Aston Martin.
Cost me a fortune.

20:43.792 --> 20:47.000
And I had them put
the wheel on the left.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.750
Wanna go for a drink?

20:51.458 --> 20:54.250
I promised a friend I'd
go to his opening.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.000
You know the painter,
Bruce Bishop?

20:57.208 --> 20:59.250
- I've seen his work.
- He's a genius!

20:59.458 --> 21:01.583
You know what?
We'll go to the party...

21:01.875 --> 21:04.292
and have a
drink afterwards.

21:04.583 --> 21:05.542
Really?

21:06.708 --> 21:07.708
Great!

21:08.958 --> 21:12.000
So they commission Oscar to
do a clock tower for a mall.

21:12.292 --> 21:14.000
And what does he propose?

21:14.708 --> 21:16.667
An eight-storey penis.

21:16.875 --> 21:20.208
- Gorgeous. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

21:20.417 --> 21:23.708
- An eight-storey penis?
- In a little town in Kansas.

21:24.042 --> 21:27.125
Imagine these farmers
driving to church...

21:27.375 --> 21:29.042
past this giant erection!

21:30.292 --> 21:31.375
Darling!

21:32.125 --> 21:34.375
- How are you?
- Thanks for coming.

21:34.583 --> 21:36.458
- A pleasure.
- I'm in trouble.

21:37.083 --> 21:39.458
Congratulations. Lee Simon.
This is amazing.

21:39.667 --> 21:42.292
- Why in trouble?
- They don't get it.

21:42.542 --> 21:46.583
I hate to think about it. Either
you get my work or you don't.

21:47.333 --> 21:50.250
But don't buy my fucking
paintings to be "in".

21:50.500 --> 21:53.417
Only if you have to
have a "Bruce Bishop".

21:53.625 --> 21:55.625
It's all about image.

21:55.875 --> 21:57.958
- One hundred per cent.
- Calm down.

21:58.167 --> 21:59.500
But he's right.

21:59.708 --> 22:01.458
- Bruce, calm down.
- We should go.

22:01.708 --> 22:03.458
- He's upset.
- I know. We should go.

22:03.708 --> 22:05.333
Wait. Are you a Libra?

22:06.083 --> 22:09.458
- I'm Sagittarius.
- That's why you're impatient.

22:09.708 --> 22:13.292
I'm attracted to Sagittarians,
but they're so impatient.

22:13.542 --> 22:16.292
- Excuse me, would you sign this?
- Of course.

22:16.583 --> 22:18.417
I use your exercise tape.

22:18.667 --> 22:20.083
- You do?
- So do I.

22:20.292 --> 22:22.125
But I exercise to it.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.750
I can see. You look great.

22:24.958 --> 22:26.583
- We should...
- Thank you.

22:26.792 --> 22:30.667
- Let's go somewhere quiet.
- You really want to do that?

22:33.333 --> 22:36.125
- How are you?
- You look gorgeous!

22:40.958 --> 22:44.125
I'll get my drink.
I'll be right back.

22:59.250 --> 23:00.792
You're so quiet.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.667
I was thinking that...

23:06.167 --> 23:09.125
you're the most
beautiful creature...

23:10.208 --> 23:12.125
I've ever seen.

23:12.333 --> 23:15.167
Every curve in your body...

23:16.875 --> 23:20.250
fulfils its promise. If the
universe has any meaning...

23:20.542 --> 23:22.708
I'm looking at it.

23:25.042 --> 23:27.458
- You're sweet.
- And you're perfect.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.417
Do you have any flaws?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.125
Physically?

23:35.458 --> 23:37.708
Any kind. You're
a miracle.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.333
I don't usually
drool in my salad.

23:40.667 --> 23:42.792
I'm not usually like this.

23:44.125 --> 23:46.542
I'm polymorphously
perverse.

23:47.458 --> 23:49.542
It's not a flaw.

23:50.292 --> 23:51.458
Just a weakness.

23:51.708 --> 23:54.333
Polymorphously perverse,
meaning...?

23:55.750 --> 23:58.375
That every part
of my body...

23:58.625 --> 24:00.917
gives me sexual pleasure.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.167
Meaning?

24:05.750 --> 24:09.500
Meaning every part of me
gives me erotic pleasure.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.375
And how...?

24:13.708 --> 24:15.750
Sensitive is that?

24:17.958 --> 24:21.958
If you touch my thighs,
my hands, my neck...

24:22.250 --> 24:23.625
my kneecaps...

24:25.083 --> 24:26.792
I'm orgasmic.

24:28.375 --> 24:30.333
Where did you learn this?

24:31.500 --> 24:33.333
It's Dionysian.

24:33.833 --> 24:35.417
A Greek taught me.

24:35.667 --> 24:37.667
Now I can't get rid of it.

24:40.083 --> 24:42.875
It's not a flaw,
just a weakness.

24:44.875 --> 24:46.625
Just to get this right.

24:46.875 --> 24:49.375
If I touch your hand...

24:49.667 --> 24:53.417
if I take it and
just stroke it...

24:53.792 --> 24:56.042
if I stroke it like
this, you...?

24:58.500 --> 24:59.833
My God!

25:00.042 --> 25:01.875
Let's get out of here.
I'll get the check.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.458
I'll get the coat and...

25:04.750 --> 25:07.167
Come on, guys,
we're going dancing!

25:07.417 --> 25:08.708
Dancing? Great!

25:08.917 --> 25:10.875
- I can't dance.
- We'll dance!

25:11.167 --> 25:13.792
- I can't dance.
- Everybody can dance.

25:14.292 --> 25:16.292
- Let's dance.
- I'll get the check.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.625
My God, I know I've
told a lot of atheist jokes...

25:19.875 --> 25:23.833
and I have no right to ask for
this, but that was just her hand!

25:43.333 --> 25:45.792
- Shit!
- What? What's wrong?

25:46.167 --> 25:48.083
I need echinacea
right away.

25:48.292 --> 25:50.167
- Right away!
- Echinacea?

25:50.542 --> 25:52.333
It's for colds.

25:52.542 --> 25:55.458
Let's go find some.
Let's leave.

25:55.708 --> 25:58.083
The health food stores
will be closed.

25:58.292 --> 25:59.917
I know an all-night
drugstore.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.667
They won't have it.
And I have none at home!

26:02.875 --> 26:05.042
I'm going to
Milan tomorrow!

26:05.917 --> 26:06.750
Yes.

26:07.958 --> 26:09.292
Ecchymosis?

26:09.708 --> 26:12.083
No, I told you,
it's an herb.

26:13.625 --> 26:17.333
Because I can't hear you!
It's an herb!

26:50.667 --> 26:53.375
I couldn't find any
echinacea.

26:53.583 --> 26:55.542
You need echinacea?

26:55.750 --> 26:58.583
- You have some?
- I always carry some.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.167
He's got some.

27:02.792 --> 27:03.833
So where to?

27:04.042 --> 27:07.417
We should go, you got
to fly to Milan tomorrow.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.042
No, it's okay.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.292
"Stuff a cold,
starve a fever"

27:11.500 --> 27:12.708
Really, it's okay.

27:12.917 --> 27:15.625
Incidentally, you're a
tremendous athlete.

27:15.917 --> 27:18.458
I'm sure you have
an enormous future.

27:18.667 --> 27:19.875
This your car?

27:20.083 --> 27:22.167
Yeah, an Aston Martin.
It's very old.

27:22.375 --> 27:25.833
Forget it, it costs a fortune.
I used to have a Volvo.

27:26.042 --> 27:28.292
I'll call you when we
play the Knicks.

27:28.542 --> 27:30.958
Right. I'll give you my number.

27:32.333 --> 27:33.375
You know...

27:34.000 --> 27:35.542
you're amazing.

27:35.833 --> 27:38.667
I notice that men
just stare at you.

27:38.917 --> 27:41.708
I mean, women stare at you!
It's incredible.

27:42.292 --> 27:44.333
- I used to live with a woman.
- Really?

27:45.500 --> 27:47.792
A beautiful young
German model.

27:48.917 --> 27:52.250
The looks we got when
we danced together!

27:53.042 --> 27:54.958
But you prefer men?

27:58.625 --> 28:00.042
Usually.

28:12.042 --> 28:13.167
That's great.

28:13.417 --> 28:16.333
You're not afraid
of catching germs?

28:16.625 --> 28:18.167
I've got a cold.

28:18.458 --> 28:21.667
From you, I'd be willing
to catch terminal cancer.

28:22.958 --> 28:24.292
My place or yours?

28:24.542 --> 28:26.625
Whichever makes you happier.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.125
My place.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.292
I have a mirror
next to the bed.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.375
You have a mirror.

28:35.958 --> 28:37.208
Sure.

28:41.583 --> 28:44.042
My God! I'm
so sorry!

28:45.083 --> 28:47.375
You're okay? Not bleeding?

28:47.625 --> 28:49.667
Just a little shaken!

28:50.625 --> 28:52.250
Christ, what were you thinking?

28:52.458 --> 28:55.750
I hope the police don't
give me a balloon test.

28:55.958 --> 28:58.042
- They'd misinterpret this.
- The police?

28:58.250 --> 29:01.750
I can't be connected with
a drunk-driving accident!

29:02.000 --> 29:03.292
I'm not drunk!

29:03.500 --> 29:05.208
The tabloids will
kill me!

29:05.417 --> 29:09.125
I just signed an endorsement
with a cosmetic company!

29:10.500 --> 29:14.250
I got to go. I'll be
fine. I'll get a cab.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
No, I'll take you, because...

29:17.292 --> 29:20.208
Are you crazy?
Look at your Aston Martin!

29:20.500 --> 29:22.875
I can claim it in the morning.
The night is young.

29:23.167 --> 29:25.208
I wanted to see your mirror.

29:25.583 --> 29:27.833
You can't leave the
scene of an accident.

29:28.125 --> 29:30.250
This is a bad neighbourhood.
You should...

29:30.458 --> 29:32.208
I'll be fine.

29:32.458 --> 29:34.167
I'm a black belt.

29:35.792 --> 29:39.458
- But if you're bleeding internally?
- Nice to meet you!

29:44.667 --> 29:46.167
Fucking cold!

29:46.833 --> 29:47.875
Rain!

29:50.833 --> 29:52.667
I've been waiting for 2 hours.

29:52.875 --> 29:55.500
- I've been waiting too.
- Dr Lupus knows you're here.

29:55.708 --> 29:57.042
I can't wait.

29:57.292 --> 30:01.208
- If you'd like to reschedule...
- I made this appointment in June.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.125
I've been waiting a year
for my appointment.

30:04.417 --> 30:07.750
I know a woman who sold
her appointment for $3,000.

30:09.458 --> 30:11.792
If they're going to touch
me, I want the best.

30:12.083 --> 30:15.917
I understand. Since that
Newsweek article, we're overrun.

30:16.792 --> 30:18.625
- Dr. Lupus!
- A few minutes.

30:19.125 --> 30:20.708
Very interesting. I
can work with that.

30:20.917 --> 30:22.667
Miss Lipton in 7.

30:23.208 --> 30:26.333
It's really worth the wait.
The man's an artist.

30:26.750 --> 30:27.958
Dr. Lupus, hello.

30:28.167 --> 30:30.542
I'm worried about my jowls.
What do you think?

30:30.750 --> 30:31.792
Yes, they'll go.

30:32.042 --> 30:34.167
- Some of the neck, too.
- Excuse me.

30:37.042 --> 30:39.708
No, no, those eyes
have to be wider.

30:39.958 --> 30:42.375
And we got to get
rid of the double chin.

30:42.583 --> 30:46.042
I want to make you look like
Pearl Chavez, the fiery half-breed.

30:46.333 --> 30:49.792
"Duel in the Sun", right? They'll
think you have Indian blood.

30:50.000 --> 30:50.833
Thank you.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.542
I don't know why I'm here.

30:53.792 --> 30:56.875
Herman, she needs a makeover.
Thanks for fitting us in.

30:57.083 --> 30:58.125
Please, please!

30:58.375 --> 31:00.000
You're very special to me.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.458
- Do I need a makeover?
- Why be less than perfect?

31:02.667 --> 31:04.292
What can we do with the eyes?

31:04.500 --> 31:06.167
I see what you mean.
They're beady.

31:06.375 --> 31:09.083
- And tighten this up, too.
- Beady?

31:09.333 --> 31:11.167
I told her you
were a genius.

31:11.375 --> 31:12.875
I read that
Newsweek article.

31:13.083 --> 31:15.583
- The lips a little fuller?
- Fuller?

31:15.792 --> 31:18.042
Not if you prefer that
cold, stressful look.

31:18.250 --> 31:20.083
- Are they too thin?
- It won't be noticeable.

31:20.292 --> 31:22.958
Well, noticeable,
but not artificial.

31:23.167 --> 31:24.917
The cameras are here.

31:25.125 --> 31:27.875
Thank you. I'm on
"News at Noon".

31:28.125 --> 31:31.292
We're in the plush office
of a man called...

31:31.542 --> 31:33.542
"the Michelangelo
of Manhattan".

31:33.792 --> 31:36.625
- Ignore the camera.
- And your breasts and buttocks?

31:36.875 --> 31:38.917
As with the great Renaissance
sculptor...

31:39.167 --> 31:41.875
unsightly flesh is molded
and suctioned away...

31:42.083 --> 31:45.917
until only youth remains...
or the illusion of youth.

31:46.625 --> 31:48.917
I'm out of here. I should go.

31:49.583 --> 31:53.208
Outside in the waiting room,
anxious faces...

31:53.458 --> 31:55.875
await transmogrification
into perfection.

31:56.125 --> 32:00.250
We don't do penis enlargements.
We don't have the space.

32:00.667 --> 32:02.542
We're talking about 3 inches.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.417
Socialite Pinky Virdon...

32:05.625 --> 32:08.375
uses the VIP entrance
for the privileged few...

32:08.625 --> 32:11.583
who do not have to plan eons
in advance for an appointment.

32:11.917 --> 32:13.833
I'm not blaming you, I have to go.

32:14.208 --> 32:15.458
I'll tell you what.

32:15.667 --> 32:16.792
I'll get your coat.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.708
- We'll go out the side exit.
- The side exit.

32:19.917 --> 32:21.625
Relax, I'll be right back.

32:22.292 --> 32:24.083
The waiting room's here.

32:24.333 --> 32:26.875
Why don't you get comments
from those women?

32:27.167 --> 32:28.750
Don't forget the nurses.

32:28.958 --> 32:30.958
Sorry if we're
disturbing you.

32:31.333 --> 32:32.792
I got a film crew here.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.458
- I was just going.
- Dr Lupus said...

32:35.875 --> 32:38.833
He did a great job on you.
You look great.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.250
Are my lips too thin?

32:42.583 --> 32:45.708
Not for me. Whatever he
charged you, it was worth it.

32:45.917 --> 32:47.667
Thanks very much.

32:47.917 --> 32:51.875
I'm Tony Gardella.
I produce "News at Noon."

32:52.250 --> 32:54.708
- And you are?
- Robin Simon.

32:54.917 --> 32:56.250
What do you do?

32:56.625 --> 32:57.833
I'm a schoolteacher.

32:58.125 --> 32:59.458
Teacher?

32:59.792 --> 33:03.250
Great, so you saved your money,
invested it here and now...

33:03.500 --> 33:05.167
you're a knockout!

33:05.458 --> 33:08.500
I'm here for a consultation.
He hasn't done anything to me.

33:08.750 --> 33:09.833
Really?

33:10.333 --> 33:12.833
From the point of
view of a total stranger...

33:13.042 --> 33:15.042
I wouldn't change a freckle.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.167
Well thank you.

33:19.333 --> 33:23.000
"I have always depended on
the kindness of strangers."

33:30.583 --> 33:33.500
Well, I better get
on with this thing.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.250
Back to work.

33:41.500 --> 33:42.375
Listen...

33:42.708 --> 33:43.958
forgive me, but...

33:44.208 --> 33:48.125
are you married or anything? And
if not, what are you doing later?

33:48.333 --> 33:50.375
- Later, when?
- Six o'clock.

33:50.625 --> 33:52.833
- Why?
- Want to go to a screening?

33:53.083 --> 33:54.083
A screening?

33:54.292 --> 33:56.333
Of a new John
Papadakis film.

33:56.542 --> 33:59.167
I have to go and I thought
you'd like to go.

34:04.833 --> 34:07.542
Thank you,
but I can't.

34:09.792 --> 34:11.625
I don't often go to the films...

34:11.875 --> 34:15.000
and I haven't
heard of that director.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.875
But thanks for
thinking of me.

34:18.167 --> 34:19.458
She'll be happy to go.

34:19.667 --> 34:20.917
This is my...

34:21.208 --> 34:24.083
Accepting for Ms. Simon,
her friend, Cheryl.

34:25.083 --> 34:27.958
And your divorce? Are you
friendly with your ex-husband?

34:28.083 --> 34:30.208
We would be if we met.

34:30.458 --> 34:33.417
I mean, this is the age
of psychotherapy, right?

34:33.625 --> 34:36.625
Everyone's so
sophisticated and mature.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.250
Hi, how are you?

34:38.542 --> 34:41.208
At least you're
not still angry.

34:42.833 --> 34:44.792
No, that phase is over.

34:45.167 --> 34:48.000
You have to stop
tantrumming...

34:48.250 --> 34:49.875
and move on with life.

34:50.083 --> 34:52.333
The champagne tastes
like it was made yesterday.

34:52.625 --> 34:54.500
Think so? I
kind of liked it.

34:54.917 --> 34:57.708
But I'm feeling lightheaded.
I shouldn't drink any more.

34:57.917 --> 34:59.583
I wish I felt lightheaded.

34:59.958 --> 35:01.667
- I hate these screenings.
- Do you?

35:01.875 --> 35:03.875
I'd rather see
a real audience.

35:05.208 --> 35:09.125
I should know all these people,
but I'm so out of touch.

35:10.167 --> 35:11.750
Let's see. You see that guy?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.500
That's Papadakis, the
director of the film.

35:14.750 --> 35:16.875
Yeah, he's arty and pretentious.

35:17.083 --> 35:20.708
One of those assholes who always
films in black and white.

35:21.083 --> 35:22.875
Tom Dale. Big star!

35:23.125 --> 35:26.375
He's filming an adaptation
of a sequel of a remake.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.917
Getting out of the elevator
is a famous critic.

35:30.125 --> 35:31.458
Him, I recognise.

35:31.708 --> 35:33.083
He used to hate every movie.

35:33.292 --> 35:36.625
But he married a young, big-bosomed
woman and now he loves every movie.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.208
God, I'm so out of touch.

35:39.542 --> 35:41.125
Can I get you a refill?

35:42.958 --> 35:43.792
Yes!

35:44.208 --> 35:46.083
What the hell? Why not?

35:47.417 --> 35:50.042
If I could think of what to do
I'd never go back to teaching.

35:50.292 --> 35:52.458
- Come work for me.
- As what?

35:52.667 --> 35:54.750
All I'm good at is Chaucer.

35:54.958 --> 35:56.958
Well, we have a
cooking show.

35:57.167 --> 35:59.958
You could do "Great
Writers' Recipes."

36:00.250 --> 36:02.875
"Chaucer's Fettucini
with Clam Sauce."

36:03.417 --> 36:05.542
"Walter Raleigh's Gazpacho."

36:05.750 --> 36:07.500
No, that's okay.

36:07.708 --> 36:10.958
But I'm glad you asked me out.
I'm having a very nice...

36:12.458 --> 36:14.417
- What's the matter?
- Lee!

36:14.625 --> 36:16.458
- Who's Lee?
- My husband.

36:16.667 --> 36:18.833
- Your husband?
- I don't want to see him here!

36:19.042 --> 36:21.375
I thought you said
it was no problem.

36:21.583 --> 36:24.250
- Stand there, stand there.
- All right, all right.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.375
No, no! There, there.

36:26.583 --> 36:29.042
Talk to me. Act
natural, for chrissake!

36:29.250 --> 36:31.125
No, more to the left!

36:31.750 --> 36:32.792
Oh, God!

36:33.000 --> 36:36.167
- No, he's going to see me.
- Where are you going?

36:36.375 --> 36:39.208
- Is he there?
- I don't know who he is.

36:39.500 --> 36:42.042
- Is he going into the cinema?
- There's a blond guy coming.

36:42.250 --> 36:43.917
Is that who I think it is?

36:44.167 --> 36:46.625
Robin, what are you doing here?

36:48.125 --> 36:49.917
I'm looking for...

36:50.208 --> 36:52.042
I dropped my earring!

36:52.333 --> 36:53.458
I found it!

36:53.708 --> 36:56.500
Bonnie, this is Robin.
Robin, this is Bonnie.

36:56.792 --> 36:58.917
- How are you?
- How am I?

36:59.125 --> 37:01.375
How am I?
You mean now?

37:01.583 --> 37:02.708
You mean...

37:02.917 --> 37:04.583
my physical health?

37:05.375 --> 37:08.833
- Whatever. Or spiritual.
- I'm fine. Thirsty.

37:09.042 --> 37:10.292
Nice to meet you.

37:11.667 --> 37:12.917
Oh dear!

37:13.958 --> 37:15.250
I guess we won't have a drink.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.292
- We'll go in and...
- See you in there.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.375
Catch you inside.
Nice to see you.

37:29.583 --> 37:33.000
- Are you all right?
- I shouldn't drink.

37:35.208 --> 37:37.292
His use of
these flashbacks...

37:37.500 --> 37:40.167
and slow motion is
pretentious, isn't it?

37:40.458 --> 37:42.292
And that harlot he's with?

37:43.625 --> 37:45.250
You think she's pretty?

37:46.250 --> 37:49.708
Probably one of those
porn channel outcalls.

37:49.958 --> 37:52.583
You dial a number
if you need an escort.

37:52.833 --> 37:55.375
Escort! I mean, really!

37:55.583 --> 37:58.875
Deep massage, they say.
But that's bullshit.

37:59.083 --> 38:01.042
You probably
dial 588-PUSS Y.

38:01.250 --> 38:03.875
I think she's an editor
for Random House, but...

38:04.083 --> 38:06.667
How could you have slept with
Sheila, my best friend?

38:06.958 --> 38:08.958
You found her bovine.

38:09.792 --> 38:11.958
His word: "Bovine".

38:12.583 --> 38:13.667
Am I lying?

38:13.875 --> 38:17.625
Didn't you say she
was a vache hollandaise?

38:18.042 --> 38:19.250
Didn't you?

38:19.792 --> 38:21.208
Am I lying?

38:22.917 --> 38:26.875
- You're sick, that's what!
- Lie in front of these people?

38:44.292 --> 38:45.917
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

38:46.125 --> 38:47.500
No, I lost control.

38:47.708 --> 38:49.958
I guess you're still
in love with him.

38:50.167 --> 38:51.458
I guess I am.

38:51.750 --> 38:53.208
Good night.

38:54.667 --> 38:56.292
Well, think about what I said.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.208
- About what?
- About coming to work for me.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.375
That's a fantasy.

39:02.750 --> 39:04.167
You're bright. You'd learn.

39:04.625 --> 39:08.333
My company's growing.
You could grow with us.

39:09.708 --> 39:11.292
Too inhibited.

39:11.708 --> 39:14.458
- That's a shame.
- I'm sorry.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.167
Good night.

39:26.917 --> 39:30.625
- Did you like the movie?
- I hate Papadakis.

39:30.833 --> 39:33.083
One cliché after another.

39:33.583 --> 39:37.250
When you see these scripts,
it's so depressing.

39:39.042 --> 39:41.417
Were you upset about
the run-in with your ex?

39:42.333 --> 39:45.250
She's an hysteric.
I'm lucky I got out.

39:45.542 --> 39:48.042
Tonight was proof
positive, if I needed proof.

39:48.375 --> 39:50.292
Sounds like you're
protesting too much.

39:50.500 --> 39:53.750
No, my class reunion was
the defining moment for me.

39:54.083 --> 39:56.000
<i>- How's that?
- A class reunion last year.</i>

39:56.208 --> 39:57.667
<i>Take my advice. Don't do it.</i>

39:57.875 --> 40:00.375
Doris, Doris! How are you?

40:00.625 --> 40:02.208
- You look the same.
- Great to see you.

40:02.417 --> 40:04.708
- This is Nat.
- Hi, Nat, how are you?

40:04.917 --> 40:07.417
- What are you up to?
- I work in imports.

40:07.625 --> 40:09.833
- What are you doing?
- I write for a travel magazine.

40:10.042 --> 40:11.458
Get to travel for free?

40:11.667 --> 40:15.292
Free, yeah, tell me about it.
We crash-landed in Dubrovnik!

40:15.500 --> 40:16.667
Eddie, Eddie!

40:16.875 --> 40:18.375
- Look what the cat dragged in.
- Nice to see you.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.458
This is Lenore, my wife.

40:21.167 --> 40:22.458
What are you up to?

40:22.667 --> 40:25.583
We've got four kids.
Two on the way.

40:25.875 --> 40:27.875
What do you do when
you're not procreating?

40:28.125 --> 40:29.292
I forget.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.958
I'm a dentist, that's it.
Have you seen Jay Tepper?

40:32.167 --> 40:34.625
Not for ages.
I don't believe this!

40:34.833 --> 40:37.583
- Lee, how are you?
- I'm good.

40:37.792 --> 40:40.333
- What are you doing these days?
- Hanging in there.

40:40.542 --> 40:42.458
Still running and killing the girls?

40:42.667 --> 40:44.083
I'm long married.

40:44.333 --> 40:46.917
This is my wife, speaking
of married. Mary.

40:47.167 --> 40:49.708
- Where's your wife?
- She has shingles.

40:49.958 --> 40:51.417
Psychological.

40:51.708 --> 40:52.750
You a shrink?

40:52.958 --> 40:55.042
Not exactly, I'm
a psychoanalyst.

40:55.250 --> 40:57.625
Can you believe this guy?

40:57.875 --> 40:59.833
- Come and give me a call.
- A call?

41:00.208 --> 41:03.708
Monroe Gordon, and his
lovely wife, Dana.

41:04.083 --> 41:07.958
Monroe, whom you all remember
was in our "Guys and Dolls"...

41:08.667 --> 41:11.875
and who went on to a
successful singing career...

41:12.167 --> 41:13.042
in Broadway...

41:13.458 --> 41:14.917
in Atlantic City...

41:15.167 --> 41:18.333
Carlton's Restaurant off the
Sunrise Highway...

41:19.625 --> 41:22.042
and the Sunrise Lounge.

41:23.792 --> 41:27.833
Monroe will sing a song made
popular in our school years.

41:58.208 --> 42:00.750
<i>What happened to my classmates?
Everyone's so...</i>

42:01.667 --> 42:03.917
<i>mature-looking and fat.</i>

42:04.208 --> 42:06.208
<i>I didn't age that much.</i>

42:06.542 --> 42:08.875
<i>Unless I did and I can't see it.</i>

42:09.083 --> 42:13.042
<i>All these dentists, veterinarians
and antique dealers...</i>

42:13.833 --> 42:17.292
<i>capped teeth and bald heads,
grey hairs coming...</i>

42:17.833 --> 42:19.458
<i>Sam Jablon has that rug on.</i>

42:19.708 --> 42:23.375
<i>Looks like it fell on him from
a window and nobody told him.</i>

42:23.958 --> 42:27.750
<i>Some dead already. Annette
DeAngelo, breasts I caressed...</i>

42:28.000 --> 42:30.417
<i>lying cold in the ground!</i>

42:31.167 --> 42:33.833
<i>God, how I wanted to
sleep with Polly Weiss.</i>

42:34.083 --> 42:35.917
<i>Now she's turned into her mother.</i>

42:36.333 --> 42:40.333
<i>Freddie Kaplan's my age. Looks
like he's from my father's club.</i>

42:40.833 --> 42:42.833
<i>I'm fucking Prufrock.</i>

42:43.708 --> 42:47.000
I've got to change
before it's too late.

42:47.458 --> 42:48.667
Pardon me?

42:49.375 --> 42:51.250
I'm not happy, Jay.

42:51.958 --> 42:54.125
Married too young.

42:54.458 --> 42:57.875
Neither of us had the
chance to live, to explore.

42:58.167 --> 43:00.625
These aren't
my office hours.

43:00.875 --> 43:04.417
I'm talking to you while
there's still time.

43:05.042 --> 43:08.583
I just turned 40. I don't
want to look up at 50...

43:08.833 --> 43:12.167
to find I've measured out
my life with coffee spoons.

43:12.417 --> 43:14.458
Try and relax.

43:16.167 --> 43:18.417
And put the vodka down.

43:18.792 --> 43:22.458
Robin's lovely.
She's a little neurotic...

43:24.667 --> 43:28.583
but I don't want to spend my life
as husband to a schoolteacher...

43:28.958 --> 43:31.917
writing the occasional
travel piece...

43:32.250 --> 43:34.042
and never knowing...

43:34.500 --> 43:36.542
what it's like to make love...

43:36.917 --> 43:40.792
to that sleazy blonde that's
married to Monroe Gordon.

43:42.625 --> 43:43.875
The truth is that...

43:44.083 --> 43:46.667
Robin is dull in bed.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.292
Fucking Catholic
inhibitions.

43:49.542 --> 43:53.167
I don't know, maybe I
don't excite her anymore.

43:54.500 --> 43:56.958
I don't know what's true anymore.

43:57.250 --> 43:59.250
Listen, are you in treatment?

43:59.458 --> 44:01.917
One minute you're in
the school lunchroom...

44:02.167 --> 44:03.625
you fucking blink...

44:03.875 --> 44:06.500
and you're 40.
Blink again...

44:06.750 --> 44:10.625
and you can see movies at half
price for senior citizens.

44:11.708 --> 44:14.667
"Ask not for whom the bell tolls."

44:15.583 --> 44:17.500
Or to be more exact...

44:17.708 --> 44:20.333
ask not for whom
the toilet flushes.

44:34.333 --> 44:36.750
Where were you while we
were making love?

44:36.958 --> 44:40.417
You know, in high school
I was Class Writer.

44:40.625 --> 44:44.042
That's why I tell you to
forget the screenplays...

44:44.250 --> 44:47.208
- and go back to writing your novel.
- Too inhibited.

44:47.458 --> 44:49.708
So you'll never get over
some bad reviews?

44:49.917 --> 44:52.792
My two novels were
dismissed. It was brutal.

44:53.042 --> 44:55.500
Maybe after I sell a
screenplay.

44:55.750 --> 44:57.208
Film is where it's at.

44:57.417 --> 45:00.125
Who reads books anymore?
Not young kids.

45:00.333 --> 45:03.708
- They're into cinema, movies.
- I don't believe that. Nor do you.

45:03.917 --> 45:05.625
Why are you getting dressed?

45:06.167 --> 45:09.167
Going home. Isn't
that what you want?

45:10.167 --> 45:12.125
I don't know what I want.

45:12.833 --> 45:16.625
You're the only one who makes
sense to me since my divorce.

45:17.125 --> 45:19.792
I don't want someone
to make sense to.

45:20.375 --> 45:22.500
I want someone to get
irrational over me.

45:22.708 --> 45:26.750
Maybe after I sell my armoured
car robbery script...

45:26.958 --> 45:29.500
I'll get back to
something more serious.

45:29.750 --> 45:33.083
Philip's having a dinner next
week. I'd love you to come.

45:33.292 --> 45:34.833
Philip Datloff?

45:35.167 --> 45:38.500
- He's sweet. You'll like him.
- I'd be too intimidated.

45:38.958 --> 45:42.708
An editor of his stature? I'd
feel guilty I wasn't writing.

45:43.875 --> 45:47.250
- I want you two to meet.
- I won't know what to say.

45:48.417 --> 45:49.875
So what's your novel about?

45:50.083 --> 45:53.292
- I don't have a novel, it's more...
- No, he does, he does.

45:53.542 --> 45:56.333
Been working on
it for over a year.

45:56.583 --> 46:00.208
- From what I've seen, it's terrific.
- Bonnie is a gifted editor.

46:00.458 --> 46:02.500
- I know this.
- I'm grooming her for my job.

46:02.708 --> 46:04.458
I didn't have the emotional
energy to finish it.

46:04.667 --> 46:08.292
And how many people read it?
Do a film, and it reaches millions.

46:08.542 --> 46:10.958
It's not energy, it's confidence.

46:11.500 --> 46:14.500
- His first two books...
- Were obliterated. The 3 S's.

46:14.708 --> 46:17.292
Self-indulgent, sophomoric,
solipsistic.

46:17.500 --> 46:20.625
If every writer who got bad press
at first caved in...

46:20.833 --> 46:21.958
You're too thin-skinned.

46:22.167 --> 46:24.375
My God, it's V.J. Rajnipal.

46:24.750 --> 46:26.500
- Excuse me.
- Philip's his editor.

46:26.750 --> 46:30.708
What am I doing here? That guy
won the Nobel and deserved...

46:30.958 --> 46:34.792
I'm out of my league.
Awash in self-contempt.

46:35.833 --> 46:38.958
You know Irwin Shaw wrote
the best anti-war play ever...

46:39.167 --> 46:40.667
and got it all into one act?

46:40.917 --> 46:43.625
Interesting you should say
that, he was my idol.

46:43.833 --> 46:46.292
At high school I read "The
Eighty Yard Run."

46:46.500 --> 46:49.625
And I wept. Cried in class.

46:49.917 --> 46:51.792
That story made
me want to write.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.375
That and some
pieces by Saroyan.

46:54.583 --> 46:56.333
You love him too?

46:56.542 --> 46:58.792
Amazing! I love the plays
and the essays.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.875
When I think of Irwin Shaw, I
think of "Girls in Summer Dresses."

47:03.083 --> 47:05.792
The title is better than most
people's short stories.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.083
It's so elegant, economic.

47:08.375 --> 47:10.042
- It's thrilling.
- The best.

47:10.250 --> 47:12.167
Thrilling prose. Terrific.

47:13.167 --> 47:16.292
My book is about the values
of a society gone astray...

47:16.500 --> 47:18.458
a culture badly
in need of help.

47:18.667 --> 47:21.333
A country that gives a 20-year-old
kid who can barely read or write...

47:21.542 --> 47:23.958
a $100 million contract
to play basketball?

47:24.167 --> 47:27.792
And a brutal murder trial, or who
is sleeping with the President...

47:28.000 --> 47:31.042
It's all show business!
All show business!

47:31.250 --> 47:32.875
Why am I getting so shrill?

47:33.083 --> 47:35.292
I get so nervous
talking about my novel.

47:35.500 --> 47:37.125
That's why you have to finish it.

47:37.333 --> 47:39.625
- You're so encouraging.
- Screenplays have their place.

47:39.833 --> 47:41.458
But there's nothing like a
serious book.

47:41.667 --> 47:42.375
Exactly my point.

47:42.583 --> 47:44.333
In "Red Letter Day",
my first book...

47:44.542 --> 47:46.667
I touched on these themes,
but I was too green.

47:46.875 --> 47:49.208
- I remember "Red Letter Day".
- Really?

47:49.417 --> 47:51.417
Yeah, I reviewed it for
the Times.

47:51.625 --> 47:52.667
It was...

47:53.167 --> 47:54.625
extremely...

47:55.417 --> 47:57.833
half-baked,
laboured...

47:58.167 --> 47:59.333
solipsistic.

47:59.875 --> 48:02.167
There was no energy.
It was trivial.

48:02.792 --> 48:04.875
You don't mind
my being frank?

48:06.833 --> 48:08.333
Are you okay?

48:11.292 --> 48:13.417
The rest of them
will be here soon.

48:13.500 --> 48:16.917
Let's not take all day on this.
Move it along! I've got plans.

48:17.167 --> 48:20.208
- This way, Mr Adelman.
- Counselor! Nice to have you back.

48:20.417 --> 48:22.833
- It's a pleasure.
- Put him in the Green Room.

48:23.042 --> 48:26.375
You're from the ACLU, right?
Can I get you anything?

48:26.708 --> 48:29.583
Yeah. I'm expecting a call.
Can you put it through?

48:29.833 --> 48:30.917
Of course. You know each other?

48:31.125 --> 48:33.167
These gentleman are from the
South Carolina Klan.

48:33.417 --> 48:35.833
We've done a few
shows together.

48:36.083 --> 48:37.583
You're Minister Polynice!

48:37.958 --> 48:40.000
The others are in
the Green Room.

48:40.208 --> 48:42.083
Is there time
for a sandwich?

48:42.292 --> 48:43.667
Of course, Mary...?

48:43.917 --> 48:46.458
- Can I see you in my office?
- Just a minute. Mary...

48:46.667 --> 48:47.917
Margaret, I'm so sorry...

48:48.125 --> 48:50.917
The attorney is
expecting a call...

48:51.125 --> 48:53.333
- Hi, I'm Dawn Dawson.
- Dawn Dawson?

48:53.542 --> 48:56.792
The teenage obese acrobat.
I had an appointment today.

48:57.667 --> 48:59.667
The teenage obese acrobat, today?

49:00.250 --> 49:02.375
- You said the 14th.
- Our "Overweight Achievers."

49:02.583 --> 49:04.583
Oh my God! I gave
out the wrong date!

49:04.792 --> 49:06.417
- You said the 14th.
- I am so sorry.

49:06.625 --> 49:08.917
Excuse me, the
skinheads are here.

49:09.125 --> 49:10.875
Green Room's
getting crowded.

49:11.083 --> 49:13.917
How about the lounge?
With Rabbi Kaufman.

49:14.125 --> 49:17.625
That'd be nice. It's just
round the corner.

49:18.542 --> 49:22.042
How about makeup? I'm a lawyer,
I can't appear without makeup!

49:23.750 --> 49:24.958
It's a madhouse.

49:25.167 --> 49:28.250
I've made a mistake. I
gave out wrong dates.

49:28.708 --> 49:31.042
- Come here.
- I'm so sorry.

49:31.250 --> 49:32.875
I screwed up. I'm so sorry.

49:33.125 --> 49:36.250
I've been watching you run
up and down all morning...

49:36.500 --> 49:38.542
and I can't take my eyes off you.

49:38.792 --> 49:42.208
I can't get the
weekend in Bermuda...

49:42.458 --> 49:43.333
out of my mind.

49:43.542 --> 49:44.958
There's lots to do.

49:45.167 --> 49:47.250
Priorities. Never
confuse...

49:47.625 --> 49:49.125
priorities.

49:49.833 --> 49:51.042
Oh my God!

49:53.167 --> 49:55.792
I'm Professor Benz. We're
here for the taping.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.875
I'm sorry, there's
been a mistake.

49:58.083 --> 50:01.667
Sorry. "Overweight Achievers"
is next week.

50:02.250 --> 50:03.250
Sorry.

50:03.833 --> 50:06.292
- Who are you?
- Lou DeMarco.

50:06.542 --> 50:07.500
Who?

50:07.917 --> 50:11.500
Uncle to Tony Lipriano from
the Genovese family, that's who.

50:11.792 --> 50:14.792
Our "Cosa Nostra"
show is next week.

50:15.125 --> 50:16.208
She told me today!

50:16.417 --> 50:18.042
I know, I'm sorry.

50:18.250 --> 50:21.458
I can't come next week.
I'm being deported Thursday.

50:24.792 --> 50:26.833
Didn't we do Sally's
show together?

50:27.042 --> 50:29.875
Going back a long time. I
only had 2 murders then.

50:30.083 --> 50:32.500
You're with William Morris?
Don't make me laugh!

50:32.708 --> 50:35.542
Where are the bagels? Have the
skinheads eaten them all?

50:39.208 --> 50:41.333
Could you interview this
professional woman...

50:41.708 --> 50:44.125
for the panel on lovemaking
next Tuesday?

50:44.333 --> 50:46.417
What's the show
called?

50:46.625 --> 50:49.667
"Working Girls Born in
Manhattan." I'm Nina.

50:49.875 --> 50:51.792
Nina, right. Great.

50:52.375 --> 50:53.333
Bye.

50:53.542 --> 50:55.667
So you're a hooker.

50:56.125 --> 50:57.458
Yeah, that's right.

50:59.083 --> 51:01.667
Hey, Tony, you
finally got here.

51:01.917 --> 51:03.417
Traffic that bad?

51:03.708 --> 51:06.458
Told you it'd be heavy
traffic. I knew it.

51:06.750 --> 51:10.125
Grandma, look who's here!
Your favourite grandson!

51:10.375 --> 51:12.750
- Hi Tony.
- Hi, Grandma.

51:14.083 --> 51:16.000
God, we were waiting for you.

51:16.250 --> 51:18.792
- Where have you been?
- This is Robin, everybody.

51:19.125 --> 51:20.167
How do you do?

51:21.833 --> 51:23.500
This is my sister, Iris.

51:25.542 --> 51:27.667
- Tony's a real doll.
- I know.

51:27.958 --> 51:29.792
He got us this house.
Show her the house.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.292
Mom, will you stop it?

51:31.708 --> 51:35.708
But there's a waiting list to get
Grandpa into the nursing home.

51:36.250 --> 51:39.458
It's the only home I trust.
The others are toilets.

51:39.667 --> 51:43.458
But this one, he'd be looked after.
But there's a waiting list.

51:44.042 --> 51:47.958
So maybe if you call and we'd tell
him it's for you, for Grandpa.

51:48.417 --> 51:49.875
Use your name.

51:50.167 --> 51:53.458
Maybe they'd move him up on
the list. Know what I mean?

51:53.708 --> 51:56.333
- We could try, Pop.
- Thanks. He needs it.

51:57.500 --> 51:58.917
Talk to him about the table.

51:59.167 --> 52:00.250
Your Grandma!

52:00.458 --> 52:04.125
I want to take Iris to LeBijou
for her birthday.

52:04.375 --> 52:07.875
It's impossible to get
a good table there.

52:08.333 --> 52:11.458
There's a 6-month waiting
list for this restaurant.

52:11.667 --> 52:14.875
- I'll have Mary make the call.
- As long as it's convenient.

52:15.083 --> 52:17.000
Tony's nobody's fool.

52:17.208 --> 52:20.292
When will you get my Knick's
season tickets upgraded?

52:20.500 --> 52:22.542
What am I, Don
Corleone here?

52:23.167 --> 52:25.375
Not for me, brother,
for your nephew.

52:25.667 --> 52:27.833
Ricky! Come here.

52:28.333 --> 52:30.833
Tell Grandma who came
and spoke at your school.

52:31.125 --> 52:33.750
- A guest speaker?
- Yeah, John Brennan.

52:34.042 --> 52:36.167
- Very nice!
- The hostage guy.

52:36.375 --> 52:38.125
- You don't know John Brennan?
- The hostage, Grandma.

52:38.333 --> 52:41.208
- You remember!
- No, I never heard of him.

52:41.458 --> 52:45.167
They hijacked his plane and
held him hostage for months.

52:45.375 --> 52:46.500
Grandma won't know.

52:46.708 --> 52:50.125
- Yes she does. Dad, you remember?
- Sure. It was in the papers.

52:50.333 --> 52:53.000
In the papers, on the
television, everything.

52:53.208 --> 52:56.708
They released him and he got this
hero's welcome. He's famous!

52:56.958 --> 52:59.542
Famous? For being
captured?

53:01.167 --> 53:04.708
Why's he a hero? It's no
feat to get captured!

53:05.708 --> 53:07.875
Your family's crazy about you.

53:08.250 --> 53:10.417
They've never had much...

53:10.708 --> 53:13.500
and my success has made
so many things possible.

53:13.750 --> 53:16.250
That's why I'm so
driven professionally.

53:16.458 --> 53:18.125
Yeah, they're lovely.

53:18.333 --> 53:21.667
It's fun to be able to do things
for people you love.

53:21.875 --> 53:25.208
Did you never think you might
want a family of your own?

53:25.458 --> 53:28.875
Yeah. I'm surprised you
don't have one.

53:29.125 --> 53:30.458
Well, you know...

53:30.708 --> 53:34.042
At the beginning we were
young, not much money.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.875
And as time went on, Lee became
edgy if I brought it up.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.375
Would you like to have a family
if we ever got married?

53:44.792 --> 53:45.917
Well, you know...

53:47.292 --> 53:50.208
- When's the other shoe gonna drop?
- What do you mean?

53:50.500 --> 53:51.708
Well, you know...

53:52.000 --> 53:53.208
I mean...

53:54.083 --> 53:56.208
you can't be this perfect.

53:56.500 --> 54:00.458
You didn't just walk into my
life with no drawbacks.

54:01.125 --> 54:04.167
Any minute I'm gonna
discover you have a wife.

54:04.417 --> 54:07.500
Or you had one, but you chopped
her up with a hatchet.

54:15.667 --> 54:18.292
Don't walk away from
me like that!

54:18.542 --> 54:21.083
- Get back in there!
- Go to hell!

54:21.333 --> 54:25.042
It's all your fucking lying!
Get her out of your life!

54:25.417 --> 54:29.292
You want to fucking
ruin our relationship?

54:29.875 --> 54:31.083
Stupid bitch!

54:31.333 --> 54:33.375
I'm fucking sick
of this bullshit!

54:33.583 --> 54:35.250
I'm sick of this bullshit!

54:35.458 --> 54:36.833
Fuck you!

54:37.833 --> 54:38.625
Stop it!

54:38.833 --> 54:40.500
Tell her to get out of our lives!

54:40.750 --> 54:43.500
I'm sick of it!
Tired of this bullshit!

54:43.750 --> 54:45.708
- I can't take it anymore!
- You're so paranoid!

54:45.917 --> 54:47.583
I fucking love you!

54:47.792 --> 54:50.458
Tell her to get the fuck
out of our lives!

54:50.750 --> 54:54.042
Listen, baby, I love you.
Don't do this to me, alright?

54:54.292 --> 54:55.875
Don't you fucking do this.

54:58.667 --> 55:00.292
Don't you fucking walk away.

55:00.542 --> 55:03.500
Don't fucking walk away
from me, bitch!

55:04.792 --> 55:06.542
There's a terrible fight
on the 11th floor.

55:06.750 --> 55:07.625
A fight?

55:07.833 --> 55:09.167
- Where?
- 1102.

55:09.375 --> 55:11.125
- Brandon Darrow.
- Every time.

55:11.333 --> 55:13.375
He seemed drunk,
so I called security.

55:13.583 --> 55:16.042
- Call the police.
- Somebody'll get hurt.

55:16.292 --> 55:17.583
Come on, hurry!

55:17.833 --> 55:19.375
He's trying to hurt me!

55:20.042 --> 55:21.375
Get in there.

55:23.542 --> 55:25.750
- What's going on here?
- Get the fuck out.

55:25.958 --> 55:28.250
I don't know what that bitch
told you, but she's lying.

55:28.458 --> 55:30.917
- I'm security.
- I'll call my lawyer...

55:31.125 --> 55:33.167
if you don't get
the fuck out of here.

55:33.833 --> 55:37.167
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Tried to push me out the window!

55:37.375 --> 55:39.042
Bitch, don't you lie to them!

55:39.375 --> 55:40.750
Don't you fucking lie!

55:41.167 --> 55:42.875
- Keep him away!
- Take it easy, pal.

55:43.083 --> 55:45.000
Get your fucking
hands off me.

55:45.458 --> 55:46.917
Easy, pal!

55:47.750 --> 55:49.917
Excuse me, I have an
appointment with Mr Darrow.

55:50.125 --> 55:52.375
Get off my neck!
I hate this hotel!

55:52.583 --> 55:55.250
- I told you, she's lying!
- I'm Lee Simon, about the script.

55:55.458 --> 55:57.708
If your friend tries to
plant coke on me again...

55:57.917 --> 55:59.500
you don't know what I'll do!

55:59.708 --> 56:02.583
- Lee Simon. I wrote "Heist".
- What the fuck you want?

56:02.792 --> 56:06.208
He tried to throw me and
my clothes out the window!

56:06.417 --> 56:10.250
Don't bullshit strangers.
And I'm not high. Look at me.

56:10.667 --> 56:14.667
- I don't make moral judgements.
- What was your name?

56:15.208 --> 56:18.042
Nicole Oliver gave you my script.
About an armoured car robbery.

56:18.250 --> 56:21.375
- It has a strong personal subplot.
- I'm gonna sue you motherfuckers!

56:21.625 --> 56:24.833
I'll sue this fleabag, fucking
cockroach hotel!

56:25.083 --> 56:27.292
- What's going on here?
- I'm sick of this!

56:27.500 --> 56:29.583
Time I got a little
respect round here!

56:29.792 --> 56:31.625
- Shut up!
- Fuck you!

56:31.875 --> 56:32.958
Shut the hell up!

56:33.208 --> 56:36.208
Little domestic problem,
but it got pretty physical.

56:36.417 --> 56:39.125
- I see your films.
- Tried to push me out the window!

56:39.417 --> 56:41.875
- This guy?
- Her friend planted dope on me!

56:42.167 --> 56:43.667
Come on, let's go downtown.

56:43.875 --> 56:45.667
Talk to my people.

56:45.917 --> 56:48.708
- Who are you?
- Lee Simon. We have a meeting.

56:48.917 --> 56:50.333
Not right now. Later maybe.

56:50.542 --> 56:52.958
Thing is, we had
a meeting scheduled...

56:53.167 --> 56:55.167
and it's important
that we meet.

56:55.458 --> 56:56.917
30 seconds would help.

56:57.792 --> 56:59.958
Come on, ladies, back up!

57:00.208 --> 57:02.875
Initially, we can have a
brief conversation...

57:03.083 --> 57:04.875
and establish what we need.

57:05.125 --> 57:06.417
Can we get these guys back?

57:06.708 --> 57:08.000
Will this take long?

57:08.208 --> 57:09.750
- Out the way!
- Make room!

57:09.958 --> 57:12.375
Is tomorrow good for you?
A week?

57:12.583 --> 57:13.792
Clear the way!

57:15.667 --> 57:18.292
Wait! Don't take him away!

57:19.000 --> 57:22.833
Lt'll be okay, baby. Call Irv
Klein, get him downtown.

57:23.042 --> 57:25.208
- I'll be out in an hour.
- Hold 'em back!

57:25.417 --> 57:28.250
He didn't do anything.
I'm not pressing charges!

57:28.458 --> 57:31.375
Don't hold him. The hotel
has no problem with this.

57:31.583 --> 57:33.750
I brought a copy
if you want to talk.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Mr Darrow, you're welcome
back in the hotel.

57:36.250 --> 57:38.625
Okay, because this is Brandon
Darrow, understand?

57:38.833 --> 57:40.875
That's the only reason.

57:41.250 --> 57:42.958
- That's it!
- Thank you very much.

57:43.167 --> 57:44.958
Mr Darrow, come back to the hotel.

57:45.500 --> 57:47.500
Stay outside, please!

57:47.833 --> 57:50.083
You're not allowed
in the hotel.

57:50.375 --> 57:53.083
If we could go into the bar
and have a drink...

57:53.458 --> 57:56.167
and talk for a few minutes,
there's some points...

57:56.417 --> 57:59.917
I'm reworking which
you'd be excited to hear.

58:00.208 --> 58:03.292
- I'm open to the whole process.
- For my wife.

58:03.500 --> 58:05.583
In just a brief
discussion, I think...

58:05.833 --> 58:07.708
Brandon, we'll be late!

58:08.042 --> 58:10.125
This is the first script I've
read with balls.

58:13.083 --> 58:15.625
- Is it 5 already?
- I had a lot of interest in it.

58:15.833 --> 58:17.958
But it's always,
"Get a bankable star."

58:18.167 --> 58:20.333
Absolutely.
We have to talk.

58:20.542 --> 58:23.042
You as Sonnyboy, with
an unknown for the female lead.

58:23.250 --> 58:25.167
- You like fights?
- Fights?

58:25.375 --> 58:28.167
We're going to Atlantic City to
see the Fernandez-Tobin fight.

58:28.375 --> 58:31.042
- Atlantic City, now?
- Yeah, it's 5 already.

58:31.250 --> 58:34.750
I have an assignment tonight.
We could talk now.

58:34.958 --> 58:36.917
I get a lot of scripts.
I'm sure!

58:37.125 --> 58:38.750
- But most are bullshit.
- Exactly!

58:38.958 --> 58:40.958
- No fucking integrity!
- We gotta go.

58:41.167 --> 58:42.708
- Yours works.
- I'm flattered.

58:42.917 --> 58:44.417
My assignment! 2 minutes!

58:44.625 --> 58:47.042
Can't reschedule me.
I fly to Africa tomorrow.

58:47.250 --> 58:50.375
They went through hell to get me
an interview with the mayor's wife.

58:50.583 --> 58:52.042
She likes acting.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.208
I got scratches all over my
arms. It's ridiculous.

58:58.500 --> 59:00.042
Do we take off from Teterboro?

59:01.417 --> 59:03.625
- From Teterboro.
- Take off?

59:05.125 --> 59:07.542
- We can't drive now.
- Some music!

59:07.750 --> 59:09.625
I can't fly.

59:09.917 --> 59:12.458
I had a horrible experience
as a travel writer...

59:12.667 --> 59:15.667
Don't be a fucking pussy.
Flight takes 20 minutes.

59:15.958 --> 59:17.625
It was a crash landing.

59:17.833 --> 59:20.333
- You like fights?
- Yes, but...

59:20.542 --> 59:22.458
D'you like Fernandez
or Tobin?

59:22.750 --> 59:24.167
Tobin's got him, man!

59:24.750 --> 59:27.667
- Tobin's got him!
- I like Fernandez.

59:27.958 --> 59:29.417
I'm impressed with your ear.

59:29.625 --> 59:31.458
- My ear?
- Yeah, dialogue.

59:31.667 --> 59:33.917
My ear! Well, I try and listen.

59:34.208 --> 59:36.625
Know what I mean?
It flows.

59:45.625 --> 59:47.042
Come on, come on!

59:47.792 --> 59:49.125
Come on, baby!

59:49.958 --> 59:52.125
Stick him! Come on!

59:52.458 --> 59:55.500
Is this a good time to go
over script problems?

59:55.708 --> 59:59.333
He can't put a fucking
combination together, shit!

01:00:02.042 --> 01:00:04.583
Let's shoot craps.
I can't sit still.

01:00:04.792 --> 01:00:07.833
If we could get our business
done, you could play more relaxed.

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:10.208
- You shoot crap?
- I don't, no.

01:00:10.417 --> 01:00:11.625
I'll teach you, man!

01:00:11.833 --> 01:00:15.042
I know the rules, but I
didn't bring much money.

01:00:15.292 --> 01:00:17.042
I'll advance you some.

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:19.167
From our royalties?
Very generous.

01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:21.583
I wanted to talk
about the opening.

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:23.917
You know? It
feels a little rushed.

01:00:24.167 --> 01:00:27.208
It's definitely rushed.
Needs more build-up.

01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:29.417
- No, not build-up.
- Not build-up!

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.042
Character development.

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:34.375
Who is this Sonnyboy?
Why's he need to score so bad?

01:00:34.583 --> 01:00:36.125
You have a feel for this.

01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:38.167
Shoot 'em, babe!

01:00:41.708 --> 01:00:43.792
You're fucking cursed.
It ain't your night.

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:47.875
I can't believe I ran
through $6,000 so fast.

01:00:49.542 --> 01:00:52.375
All right, seven or eleven!
Gimme the dice!

01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:54.417
Seven or eleven, baby!

01:00:55.167 --> 01:00:58.250
You know after the opening
scene, when Sonnyboy meets...

01:01:06.167 --> 01:01:08.458
Hey man, you partake in this?

01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:12.333
Well I have some alcohol,
so... not really.

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:17.000
So I was wondering how you felt
about how I handled the robbery.

01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:19.333
It's a terrific sequence,
I'm very happy...

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.292
Needs a complete rewrite.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.833
Nobody'd believe you could steal
an armoured car in the daytime.

01:01:25.042 --> 01:01:27.625
- It's ridiculous.
- Not enough subterfuge.

01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:30.333
For you, baby.

01:01:31.542 --> 01:01:32.917
Hey, you like her?

01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:35.750
- She's a terrific person.
- Got a nice ass.

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:38.958
With some helicopter
shots, we could...

01:01:39.167 --> 01:01:41.083
Let's take the party inside,
what d'you say?

01:01:41.292 --> 01:01:44.375
I'd like to talk more in-depth
about the denouement...

01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:47.708
I feel there's a chance there
to say something special.

01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:56.542
Excuse me, Brandon, we
can finish this in a second.

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.583
I don't want to
get in the way, so...

01:01:58.792 --> 01:02:00.667
Why don't you get into bed...

01:02:00.875 --> 01:02:03.083
and we'll be there
in a minute, right?

01:02:03.417 --> 01:02:05.375
Excuse me, have
you got a second?

01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:07.292
This is an unfamiliar
scenario to me.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.333
Listen, I know Gina
from before.

01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:11.875
You won't be sorry. Trust me.

01:02:12.625 --> 01:02:15.458
- You mean, all of us?
- Yeah, what's the problem?

01:02:15.667 --> 01:02:18.167
You never been with more
than two broads before?

01:02:18.375 --> 01:02:20.917
The woman thing is
not a... you know.

01:02:21.167 --> 01:02:22.958
But with guys I'm uncomfortable.

01:02:23.208 --> 01:02:25.625
But we're not
getting together, right?

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.500
You do like women, don't you?

01:02:27.708 --> 01:02:29.208
If it was, like on their own...

01:02:29.417 --> 01:02:32.333
with just 2, 5, 500, it
wouldn't matter, but...

01:02:32.542 --> 01:02:34.125
So my presence disturbs you?

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:36.833
You know, the idea of a naked
man per se, conceptually...

01:02:37.083 --> 01:02:39.833
a naked man is
not an issue for me.

01:02:40.042 --> 01:02:43.458
- Do we need the door closed?
- Ever been in a boy's locker room?

01:02:43.667 --> 01:02:46.042
Sure. I have
track medals.

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:47.625
I was all-city.

01:02:47.833 --> 01:02:49.542
So what's the problem?

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:51.375
I don't know how to put it.

01:02:51.625 --> 01:02:55.208
It's a wave of panic at the
proximity of male genitalia...

01:02:55.458 --> 01:02:57.500
in conjunction with the
specific activity implied.

01:02:57.708 --> 01:02:59.458
Add to which, I'm still airsick.

01:02:59.667 --> 01:03:00.875
I don't know if I can...

01:03:01.083 --> 01:03:03.083
You writers are
so sensitive, you know?

01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:05.458
You should be writing
greeting cards, not scripts.

01:03:20.042 --> 01:03:22.250
What's up?
Not in the mood?

01:03:22.542 --> 01:03:23.583
I'm just...

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.292
I don't know...

01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:28.625
tired, you know. Drunk.
Just had alcohol.

01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:33.125
Brandon tells me
you're his writer.

01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:34.958
Well, y'know, I'm a writer.

01:03:36.042 --> 01:03:37.083
I write.

01:03:37.417 --> 01:03:39.083
I wrote some film scripts.

01:03:39.333 --> 01:03:40.375
Really?

01:03:40.625 --> 01:03:42.583
Ever heard of Chekhov?

01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:44.083
I have.

01:03:44.292 --> 01:03:45.917
I write like him.

01:03:46.792 --> 01:03:48.250
You write like him?

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:02.458
So Brandon, the scene
in the church...

01:04:02.667 --> 01:04:06.042
where Sonnyboy's killed by his
brother? Does that work?

01:04:06.417 --> 01:04:09.458
Listen, we'll definitely
speak about this again.

01:04:09.667 --> 01:04:12.750
I'm going to Africa tomorrow to
do a pretty complicated picture...

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.833
and then I have another picture in
L.A., and then maybe we can talk.

01:04:17.292 --> 01:04:19.458
But I really want
to do your script.

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:21.667
It just needs a little
bit of work.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.958
I need to think about it.
Know what I mean?

01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:25.875
Have a great drive
back to New York.

01:04:26.083 --> 01:04:28.583
My agent will call
you about the $6,000.

01:04:28.792 --> 01:04:32.458
You can pay it back in
installments. He'll call you.

01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:35.625
Yeah, Bonnie?

01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:38.083
You sitting down?

01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:40.083
No, I just...

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:42.958
I guess I just woke up.

01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:46.917
I've decided to
finish my novel.

01:04:47.542 --> 01:04:49.125
Yeah, I know, I know.

01:04:49.417 --> 01:04:52.208
No, I won't let anything stand
in my way, I'll work...

01:04:52.458 --> 01:04:56.083
nights, weekends,
whatever it takes.

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:57.542
Well, I came home...

01:04:57.792 --> 01:05:01.458
and looked for the chapters I'd
written, but I couldn't find them.

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:06.667
And I thought, "God, maybe I've
thrown them out by mistake!"

01:05:06.875 --> 01:05:08.958
And I panicked. Panicked!

01:05:09.667 --> 01:05:11.333
No, then I found them.

01:05:11.542 --> 01:05:13.208
My God, but that panic!

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.708
It just made me realise...

01:05:16.375 --> 01:05:18.417
how dear they are to me.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.500
So I reread them
and I just...

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.833
Well, they contain...

01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:28.083
every aspiration
I've ever had...

01:05:28.583 --> 01:05:31.000
every authentic
feeling...

01:05:31.292 --> 01:05:32.750
every idea.

01:05:32.958 --> 01:05:35.083
And I just got no choice.

01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:37.667
I have to complete this.
This is me.

01:05:39.125 --> 01:05:40.917
I love this book.

01:05:41.167 --> 01:05:42.750
I love this book.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:46.542
Well, thank you.

01:06:08.292 --> 01:06:09.875
Come on in.

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:12.250
Are you okay?

01:06:12.958 --> 01:06:14.958
You seemed tense
on the phone.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.167
Yeah, come in. Want a drink?

01:06:17.417 --> 01:06:19.000
Well, I wouldn't mind.

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.458
Some white wine,
if you have it.

01:06:26.333 --> 01:06:27.833
So let me explain.

01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:31.667
When we spoke
after the show...

01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:36.417
we touched lightly on,
for want of a better term...

01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:38.917
sexual technique.

01:06:39.542 --> 01:06:40.750
Do you recall?

01:06:41.875 --> 01:06:44.333
Certain strategies for...

01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:46.792
pleasing a man in bed.

01:06:49.458 --> 01:06:51.250
I don't know why...

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.792
I'm so rattled.

01:06:54.042 --> 01:06:56.833
I said this so clearly on my
pillow last night...

01:06:57.083 --> 01:07:00.125
- and now I'm all disjointed.
- Have some more wine.

01:07:03.083 --> 01:07:05.417
I want you to show
me some things.

01:07:05.625 --> 01:07:06.667
On television?

01:07:06.875 --> 01:07:08.083
No, for me.

01:07:08.417 --> 01:07:09.542
Personally.

01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:12.125
Let me explain.

01:07:14.042 --> 01:07:15.417
The man I'm going with...

01:07:15.667 --> 01:07:17.625
whom I love
very dearly...

01:07:18.292 --> 01:07:19.917
is very sexually active.

01:07:20.125 --> 01:07:21.542
Which is great.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:23.042
You know, great!

01:07:23.292 --> 01:07:25.500
Our sex life...

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:28.333
is very solid and physical.

01:07:28.542 --> 01:07:30.833
Well, obviously physical!

01:07:31.042 --> 01:07:33.500
And the sad truth is...

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:34.875
Well, no.

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:37.458
I only recently
got divorced...

01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:40.000
after being married to the same
man since I was in college...

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:41.667
whom I loved...

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.208
but who was all I'd
experienced.

01:07:44.708 --> 01:07:46.208
I say this...

01:07:46.542 --> 01:07:50.167
confidentially, because I
respect you professionally.

01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:55.375
I think I disappointed
him sexually.

01:07:56.125 --> 01:07:58.292
I come from a very
uptight...

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.000
proper family...

01:08:00.292 --> 01:08:02.167
and I was taught...

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.500
growing up...

01:08:04.708 --> 01:08:08.000
that a lot of acts of
lovemaking are wrong.

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.958
In my mother's eyes, actually...

01:08:10.167 --> 01:08:11.417
quite sinful.

01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:13.375
And so...

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.917
I went to a Catholic
school, you know?

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:21.125
Not that Tony
complains, but I feel...

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:24.000
that I'm not really...

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:26.875
that he's being kind.

01:08:27.667 --> 01:08:30.542
And it's a testament to
his feelings for me...

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:34.167
that he desires me as much
as he does and enjoys it.

01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:37.625
Don't get me wrong, we both
do. I love being wanted...

01:08:37.832 --> 01:08:39.917
and the actual act itself.

01:08:40.207 --> 01:08:41.792
But I just feel...

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:45.457
that I can do better.

01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:48.875
And I want him to have the best.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:51.957
I don't want him,
after a while...

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:54.417
to start wanting experiences
with other women.

01:08:54.707 --> 01:08:56.792
I couldn't
take that again.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.292
Is any of this making
sense to you?

01:09:01.625 --> 01:09:02.375
Yeah.

01:09:02.957 --> 01:09:05.207
So you what you
want is lessons.

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:06.875
I guess so, yeah.

01:09:07.082 --> 01:09:09.917
I mean, I'm sure this
is highly unusual. Or not!

01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:11.542
Of course you'll get paid.

01:09:11.832 --> 01:09:14.042
Why not go to one
of those therapists?

01:09:14.292 --> 01:09:15.457
No, no!

01:09:15.707 --> 01:09:18.292
I don't want to get clinical
with Tony.

01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:22.457
I wanted to learn it from someone
who'll teach it to me...

01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:25.500
down and dirty! If you
know what I mean.

01:09:25.792 --> 01:09:27.707
Just wondering where to begin.

01:09:27.957 --> 01:09:29.542
How about oral sex?

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.332
Because, y'know, I sometimes feel...

01:09:33.625 --> 01:09:36.292
it just doesn't
come naturally to me.

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:37.957
It's laboured.

01:09:38.167 --> 01:09:40.207
I have trouble
breathing, actually.

01:09:40.417 --> 01:09:44.250
And once a cap fell off my
tooth and I swallowed it.

01:09:45.667 --> 01:09:47.417
Do you enjoy it?

01:09:50.332 --> 01:09:52.207
I certainly don't mind it.

01:09:52.957 --> 01:09:54.417
But do you enjoy it?

01:09:54.833 --> 01:09:57.708
What goes through your
mind when you're doing it?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.542
The Crucifixion.

01:10:00.958 --> 01:10:03.625
I can't help it,
it's my upbringing.

01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:05.417
All right, look...

01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:07.917
show me how you do it.

01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:09.917
- Go ahead.
- Now?

01:10:10.125 --> 01:10:13.292
Yeah. Take the banana and
give me your best blowjob.

01:10:13.583 --> 01:10:14.500
Go ahead.

01:10:15.667 --> 01:10:17.917
Yeah, down the hatch.

01:10:27.542 --> 01:10:29.042
Oh my God!

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.708
- Have you ever injured him?
- No. Is it too hard?

01:10:32.958 --> 01:10:34.375
Well, it's a little...

01:10:34.667 --> 01:10:36.083
You see, I'm overeager.

01:10:36.375 --> 01:10:38.458
I just try too hard.

01:10:38.792 --> 01:10:40.417
It's all right. I'll show you.

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:42.917
I'll show you how to do it.
Here you go. Watch me.

01:10:43.167 --> 01:10:45.333
It's a gentle, slow,
medium-slow motion.

01:10:45.583 --> 01:10:47.125
Get all you can in your mouth...

01:10:47.333 --> 01:10:49.458
Depth of penetration is vital.

01:10:49.708 --> 01:10:51.625
Okay, watch this. Ready?

01:11:08.042 --> 01:11:10.208
My God! Are you choking?

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.917
You're choking!

01:11:13.292 --> 01:11:14.458
Oh my God!

01:11:16.833 --> 01:11:18.333
Arms up!

01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:25.208
My God! Put your
arms up again.

01:11:25.667 --> 01:11:26.792
Thrust!

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:29.542
Is that out?

01:11:30.292 --> 01:11:32.292
I am so sorry!

01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:34.583
Do you want some water?

01:11:35.042 --> 01:11:36.333
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:40.000
I feel dreadful,
like it's my fault.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:41.792
- It's all right.
- Are you okay?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:42.958
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:11:43.208 --> 01:11:44.750
Oh dear!

01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:49.750
I need some more practice.

01:11:50.208 --> 01:11:52.083
Should you be smoking?

01:11:53.583 --> 01:11:55.000
Oh yeah! All right.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.083
A toast...

01:12:00.292 --> 01:12:01.708
to Sid Melnick!

01:12:02.542 --> 01:12:06.333
And to the best book written
about the CIA in 10 years.

01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:10.750
- Why's he so insecure?
- He's crazy.

01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:13.500
- Feel like another drink?
- It would be good.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.583
- Can I refill you?
- Yes, refill me.

01:12:15.833 --> 01:12:17.542
Keep an eye on him.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:20.833
- Bonnie's terrific.
- And a wonderful editor.

01:12:21.333 --> 01:12:25.125
I get the feeling she's controlling
the chaos you call your life.

01:12:25.917 --> 01:12:27.375
I figured, "Fuck it!"

01:12:27.625 --> 01:12:30.833
We've been practically living
together for the last 6 months.

01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:32.625
So why not? I made
the commitment...

01:12:32.833 --> 01:12:35.833
and so she gave up her place.
She moved in today.

01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:39.000
Know what I hate about
promotional book tours?

01:12:39.208 --> 01:12:41.208
You work your ass off...

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:43.708
knock yourself out,
then go to a bookstore...

01:12:43.958 --> 01:12:45.250
they don't have your book.

01:12:45.458 --> 01:12:47.792
- They never stock your book.
- I know.

01:12:48.292 --> 01:12:51.542
The screenplay, the famous
screenplay, went nowhere.

01:12:51.833 --> 01:12:55.208
You need a star and it's just
fucking death. The humiliation!

01:12:55.417 --> 01:12:57.875
- Business.
- Total, y'know?

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:01.833
Why don't you tell them
what you've been doing?

01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:04.208
- Oh, please!
- What?

01:13:04.417 --> 01:13:06.958
- What is it?
- I've almost finished my novel.

01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:08.667
Really?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.875
I've been slaving over it for
a year in my spare time.

01:13:12.167 --> 01:13:13.958
But with the reception
my previous books got...

01:13:14.208 --> 01:13:15.917
I'm a glutton for
punishment, right?

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:19.542
- This'll be a huge success.
- He's being modest.

01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:21.750
- It's great.
- You read it?

01:13:21.958 --> 01:13:24.917
You're gonna go by my
new roommate now?

01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:27.417
Because she has
no agenda here.

01:13:35.292 --> 01:13:37.458
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:40.333
I know these guys!

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:42.125
- Lee, how you doing?
- Good to see you.

01:13:42.333 --> 01:13:44.083
- Good to see you again.
- How you been?

01:13:44.292 --> 01:13:45.375
This is Nola.

01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:47.792
That's Bonnie and Kevin.

01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:50.667
That's Lee.

01:13:51.417 --> 01:13:52.792
So, how are you?

01:13:54.583 --> 01:13:55.792
Here we go.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.083
Do you mind if...?
Thank you.

01:13:59.292 --> 01:14:01.125
- How's it going?
- Very good.

01:14:02.042 --> 01:14:03.292
So, how you doing?

01:14:03.958 --> 01:14:05.208
I'm good.

01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:08.708
I finished a long article.
Worked on it for 5 months...

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.833
and then we've been
vacationing a little bit.

01:14:12.083 --> 01:14:13.167
My goodness!

01:14:13.375 --> 01:14:14.250
Where'd you go?

01:14:14.458 --> 01:14:16.000
To California.

01:14:16.208 --> 01:14:18.000
Have you read Sid's book?

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:19.625
- How you been?
- Good.

01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:22.042
I liked it very much.
A bit long.

01:14:22.292 --> 01:14:24.125
Not too long. I was engrossed.

01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:27.583
- How's your acting career?
- Slow, but breathing.

01:14:27.917 --> 01:14:30.542
- Still working at Chippers?
- You remembered.

01:14:32.958 --> 01:14:36.500
What was the spy movie we saw
last week? "The Hawk and the...?"

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:38.042
"The Falcon and the Snowman."

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:39.417
Thank you.

01:14:39.667 --> 01:14:41.792
Doesn't it remind
you of that a bit?

01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:43.917
Maybe I don't
remember the movie.

01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:46.833
Young spies in trouble...

01:14:48.792 --> 01:14:50.500
What have you been doing?

01:14:51.375 --> 01:14:52.542
Nothing interesting.

01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:54.458
- I called you Friday.
- I'm sorry.

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:57.833
I got your message. We were
in California a couple more days...

01:14:58.083 --> 01:15:00.667
because she's never been
to San Francisco.

01:15:00.917 --> 01:15:03.458
- I love that town!
- It was wonderful.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:05.750
Until I tried to drive.

01:15:07.667 --> 01:15:10.250
Never been more
terrified in my life.

01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:12.333
- You should've seen her!
- I tried!

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:15.667
We were airborne, literally.
Like a special-effects movie.

01:15:15.875 --> 01:15:17.000
It was scary.

01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:21.708
I was just clutching the
thing for my life.

01:15:22.208 --> 01:15:23.750
- Where'd you stay?
- The Fairmont.

01:15:24.167 --> 01:15:25.417
Big time!

01:15:26.083 --> 01:15:28.167
How'd you meet David?

01:15:28.417 --> 01:15:29.708
How did we meet?

01:15:29.917 --> 01:15:32.958
Well, I took her away
from a Nobel scientist.

01:15:33.167 --> 01:15:35.625
I wasn't even going
out with him.

01:15:35.833 --> 01:15:37.042
I was his translator.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:38.708
Yes, and companion.

01:15:38.917 --> 01:15:42.583
And she translated so well that
he offered to dump his wife.

01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:46.208
You make it sound more
interesting than it was.

01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:48.333
- Really?
- Excuse me.

01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:19.042
Got a minute, Lee? Say
hello to Shelly Rubin.

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:22.917
You gotta catch this kid.
Great young comic.

01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:26.083
Someone has to
do a piece on him.

01:16:26.292 --> 01:16:28.125
The next Robin Williams.

01:16:28.792 --> 01:16:32.250
Do Jack Nicholson
at the Seder for him.

01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:33.500
It's hysterical.

01:16:33.708 --> 01:16:38.083
Just attended my first Seder.
What a shindig that was!

01:16:38.417 --> 01:16:39.833
Haggadah this...

01:16:40.042 --> 01:16:41.375
haggadah that.

01:16:41.583 --> 01:16:44.625
Only thing you gotta do
is drink a lot of wine.

01:16:45.042 --> 01:16:46.583
That's uncanny.

01:16:47.125 --> 01:16:49.292
- Isn't it great?
- Glad I saw it live.

01:16:49.542 --> 01:16:52.500
- You have a great future.
- But I got more.

01:16:52.958 --> 01:16:54.500
Cabernet for the Manichewitz...

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:57.333
Thanks, Lee.
We'll hook up.

01:16:57.542 --> 01:17:00.083
- We should talk and meet.
- Nice talking to you!

01:17:00.292 --> 01:17:01.917
We'll be in touch,
okay? Thanks.

01:17:02.792 --> 01:17:05.875
Just in time. I was dying
of comedy poisoning.

01:17:06.083 --> 01:17:07.500
You never came by.

01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:11.833
I don't know why. Got
sidetracked, I guess.

01:17:12.083 --> 01:17:13.250
That's all right.

01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:16.458
Though I was pretty sure
you'd come that night.

01:17:16.792 --> 01:17:19.833
All that talk
about my great face...

01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:22.000
Well, it still looks...

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:23.542
exquisite.

01:17:23.875 --> 01:17:27.292
Under these lights, especially,
you look fantastic.

01:17:27.792 --> 01:17:30.917
Is that your girlfriend, or
another transvestite?

01:17:31.167 --> 01:17:32.417
No, she's just...

01:17:32.708 --> 01:17:34.083
She's a friend.

01:17:35.292 --> 01:17:36.833
She's beautiful.

01:17:37.417 --> 01:17:38.875
I'll get you a...

01:17:40.833 --> 01:17:43.542
So you're with
David, right?

01:17:43.917 --> 01:17:45.250
Yes and no.

01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:47.542
Meaning?

01:17:47.792 --> 01:17:49.458
What are you doing later?

01:17:53.167 --> 01:17:54.458
Later?

01:17:54.833 --> 01:17:57.792
After you drop off your
date, are you busy?

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:01.667
When? When
later?

01:18:01.875 --> 01:18:05.792
We're meeting some friends now,
but why don't you meet me?

01:18:06.042 --> 01:18:09.625
Meet me at the kiosk
opposite El Teddy's at 12.

01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:11.500
Twelve noon, Tomorrow?

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:14.500
Twelve tonight.
Unless you're busy.

01:18:14.708 --> 01:18:16.167
Twelve tonight?

01:18:16.417 --> 01:18:18.417
Can I make you a
more European offer?

01:18:18.625 --> 01:18:20.750
A kiosk at midnight?

01:18:22.292 --> 01:18:23.625
Sure, sure.

01:18:24.292 --> 01:18:26.292
We should get going.

01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:29.208
Congratulations on the novel.

01:18:29.458 --> 01:18:30.958
It's been a ballbreaker.

01:18:31.167 --> 01:18:32.333
Really?

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:34.583
- Bonnie said she loved it.
- She would.

01:18:34.875 --> 01:18:36.500
And she's a ballbreaker.

01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:40.458
I hope it's good. I put two
years of my life into it.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:46.042
I've never worked longer
than 5 months on anything, so...

01:18:47.083 --> 01:18:49.167
Heard what Eric Jeffers said?

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:50.167
No.

01:18:50.375 --> 01:18:53.542
She's working on a book about
experiences in the judicial system.

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:55.417
Ought to be a beaut.

01:18:55.667 --> 01:18:58.167
Isn't Nola a little young
for David Delile?

01:18:58.375 --> 01:18:59.250
Young?

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.042
He's your age, right?

01:19:01.292 --> 01:19:02.917
I don't know.

01:19:03.792 --> 01:19:05.250
How are you? Tired?

01:19:05.458 --> 01:19:08.000
I got a little ulcer
problem here.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.958
Poor baby. Got
a tummy ache?

01:19:11.208 --> 01:19:12.333
Want your Pepcid?

01:19:12.542 --> 01:19:15.792
- I checked. We're all out.
- We got some Mylanta.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.292
Only Pepcid works for me.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.208
I'll go to the 24-hour drugstore.

01:19:20.458 --> 01:19:22.042
- This is bugging me.
- You going now?

01:19:22.292 --> 01:19:24.333
- Yeah, it's a drag.
- I'm half-undressed.

01:19:24.667 --> 01:19:26.167
You don't have to go!

01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:28.292
You go to bed and...

01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:30.208
Don't be silly.

01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:34.750
I don't need an escort
to go to the...

01:19:35.833 --> 01:19:37.083
drugstore.

01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:40.000
I should get this fixed...

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:42.500
otherwise it'll bug me all night.

01:19:42.792 --> 01:19:46.375
Be back soon, the moving men
are coming early tomorrow.

01:19:46.708 --> 01:19:49.167
Yeah, I won't forget.
What's the time?

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:50.542
It's 11:45.

01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:52.750
- See you soon.
- Give me a kiss.

01:19:52.958 --> 01:19:55.208
- Very soon, okay?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:19:55.417 --> 01:19:56.583
I'm beat.

01:20:26.417 --> 01:20:27.917
Sorry I'm late.

01:20:28.167 --> 01:20:29.833
Been waiting long?

01:20:31.125 --> 01:20:32.542
You're not late.

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:34.750
Listen, I have to level with you.

01:20:34.958 --> 01:20:37.792
I can't really go
anywhere right now.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.417
I don't know where to begin.

01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:42.333
My luck's been lousy.

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:45.708
I got myself into a situation,
for whatever reason.

01:20:45.958 --> 01:20:47.833
I was married
for a long time.

01:20:48.083 --> 01:20:51.958
I thought I'd be better
single and it's been great.

01:20:52.542 --> 01:20:55.458
It's been wild,
but lonely too.

01:20:55.708 --> 01:20:59.000
And I know I should've come
by for you when I met you...

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:00.875
and I didn't.

01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:04.583
And I think I didn't because I
was wary of you...

01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:08.750
because I knew you triggered
some real feelings inside me.

01:21:10.042 --> 01:21:12.250
And yet again, I fucked up.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.125
But I'm going to rectify
things before it's too late.

01:21:15.333 --> 01:21:17.625
So please, what are
you doing tomorrow?

01:21:20.625 --> 01:21:22.708
Is that you or your novel?

01:21:22.917 --> 01:21:25.542
I'll be okay by
tomorrow, I promise.

01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:31.208
I don't want to to cause
anyone any problems.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.292
Sure. And David and you?

01:21:33.667 --> 01:21:37.625
I've told David many times I
need someone to control me...

01:21:38.417 --> 01:21:40.333
and I don't think he can do it.

01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:44.125
And every guy
I meet...

01:21:44.417 --> 01:21:48.375
thinks he'll be the one who'll
make me faithful. So be warned.

01:21:49.292 --> 01:21:52.250
You should know
I don't scare easily.

01:21:52.542 --> 01:21:54.958
I'm telling you because
you don't know me.

01:21:55.167 --> 01:21:57.250
I know you, I've written
about you twice.

01:21:57.458 --> 01:22:01.250
Twice you were the obscure
object of desire in my books.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.250
The books failed.
My fault, not yours.

01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:07.458
But I know you
inside out. It's scary.

01:22:07.667 --> 01:22:10.208
Don't be misled.
You didn't make me up.

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.042
I'm telling that whatever
restlessness you've felt...

01:22:13.333 --> 01:22:16.292
whatever moodiness
and unpredictability...

01:22:16.542 --> 01:22:18.833
you've broken
hearts with...

01:22:19.625 --> 01:22:21.958
and baby, you're
a heartbreaker...

01:22:23.458 --> 01:22:25.625
it's all over
tonight.

01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:31.333
Where'd you get that confidence?
Or are you scared?

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.250
I'm not David.

01:22:33.625 --> 01:22:36.500
I created you twice out
of my imagination.

01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:39.875
I wrote about you before
I even knew you existed.

01:22:40.083 --> 01:22:42.917
Except one day,
I knew I'd meet you.

01:22:44.542 --> 01:22:45.958
Well, what am I thinking?

01:22:46.167 --> 01:22:48.875
You're thinking, "I wish
he'd shut up and kiss me."

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:53.250
- But you're late.
- I'm not late.

01:22:53.625 --> 01:22:55.625
I think I'm right
on time for you.

01:22:56.125 --> 01:22:59.833
But why would I kiss you here with
your apartment two blocks away?

01:23:00.083 --> 01:23:02.583
- How did you know?
- Why wouldn't I know?

01:23:02.792 --> 01:23:05.250
You were "Steffi"
in my first book...

01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:07.417
and "Louise" in my second...

01:23:11.625 --> 01:23:13.083
and now you're Nola.

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.250
- Hello?
- Movers.

01:23:43.458 --> 01:23:46.833
Come right up, please.
I'll leave the door open.

01:24:01.208 --> 01:24:02.333
Wake up!

01:24:05.167 --> 01:24:07.417
The movers are here
with my things.

01:24:07.667 --> 01:24:09.542
Sorry about last night.

01:24:09.917 --> 01:24:13.333
The second you left for
the drugstore I conked out.

01:24:13.625 --> 01:24:16.208
You must've been so disappointed
when you got back.

01:24:16.542 --> 01:24:19.375
- The moving men are here?
- Yup. It's 7:30.

01:24:19.667 --> 01:24:22.125
- Listen, Bonnie.
- I made some coffee.

01:24:22.417 --> 01:24:24.875
- Bonnie, listen.
- What is it?

01:24:25.125 --> 01:24:26.292
I have to...

01:24:26.958 --> 01:24:28.417
talk to you.

01:24:28.667 --> 01:24:30.375
All right, I'm listening.

01:24:30.625 --> 01:24:32.833
You got to listen.

01:24:33.083 --> 01:24:36.875
- I've done a terrible thing.
- I bet it's a really bad thing.

01:24:37.125 --> 01:24:39.708
- No, you should listen.
- All right.

01:24:40.792 --> 01:24:43.250
I don't know how to say it, but...

01:24:44.833 --> 01:24:48.625
- I wanna call this off.
- What are you talking about?

01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:51.208
I know you'll think I'm the most...

01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:54.167
fucked-up son of a bitch in
the world, and I am.

01:24:54.417 --> 01:24:57.625
I'll try and be honest in
my own stupid way.

01:24:58.292 --> 01:25:00.167
I met someone else, Bonnie.

01:25:02.125 --> 01:25:03.542
You what?

01:25:04.208 --> 01:25:06.500
Listen, I met someone else.

01:25:07.667 --> 01:25:11.083
I met someone else. I don't
know how else to say it.

01:25:11.542 --> 01:25:14.625
- How could you?
- You have every right to hate me.

01:25:15.708 --> 01:25:19.375
- I just moved in yesterday.
- I'm just so screwed up.

01:25:19.667 --> 01:25:21.500
I wish I could put
it another way, but...

01:25:21.708 --> 01:25:23.542
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

01:25:23.792 --> 01:25:27.083
- Moving in together...
- Yeah, it was your idea!

01:25:27.333 --> 01:25:29.083
I know, and if I could explain it...

01:25:29.375 --> 01:25:31.750
So when did you meet
this "someone else"?

01:25:32.125 --> 01:25:34.500
- That's not important...
- No, it is!

01:25:34.708 --> 01:25:36.333
I have rearranged my goddam life!

01:25:36.542 --> 01:25:39.125
I know you did. And
this is so difficult to...

01:25:39.375 --> 01:25:42.417
- You said you loved me!
- I said I thought I did.

01:25:42.792 --> 01:25:44.875
And believe me, I wanted to.

01:25:45.125 --> 01:25:47.542
- You're a wonderful person.
- Know what?

01:25:47.833 --> 01:25:50.083
- You're a sick son of a bitch.
- You're right.

01:25:50.292 --> 01:25:53.417
- That goes downstairs.
- Get the fuck out, please? Thanks.

01:25:53.708 --> 01:25:56.333
Listen, I accept
full responsibility.

01:25:56.583 --> 01:25:58.250
I'm a total asshole.

01:25:58.542 --> 01:26:00.750
Yeah, you're a total asshole!

01:26:00.958 --> 01:26:04.000
But I thought if I was honest
and brought it up openly...

01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:06.708
that we could understand
that at least...

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.625
I truly do not mean
you any harm.

01:26:09.875 --> 01:26:13.708
I know how you
feel and I feel so bad.

01:26:14.333 --> 01:26:16.917
But if we just
accept me as sick...

01:26:17.125 --> 01:26:20.167
and try to, I know it's
hard, remain rational...

01:26:20.417 --> 01:26:23.500
then we can do this with
the minimum of disruption.

01:26:23.792 --> 01:26:27.708
Naturally, you can store your
stuff here for a while and...

01:26:28.125 --> 01:26:29.625
You're fucking psychotic!

01:26:29.833 --> 01:26:33.083
Bonnie, this is hard and I
just don't know. I'm so...

01:26:33.333 --> 01:26:34.500
Ah, boy!

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:39.458
What are you doing with my novel?

01:26:41.792 --> 01:26:44.000
Now, that's an only copy!

01:26:50.917 --> 01:26:52.000
Hey, buddy!

01:26:52.292 --> 01:26:55.667
Did you see a woman come
out of here with a manuscript?

01:26:56.375 --> 01:26:58.875
I saw a girl come out the door.

01:26:59.083 --> 01:27:00.500
Where'd she go?

01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:02.833
Tall girl?
Ran across the street.

01:27:57.167 --> 01:27:58.250
In 5...

01:27:58.333 --> 01:27:59.208
4...

01:27:59.417 --> 01:28:00.333
3...

01:28:02.333 --> 01:28:05.167
Now "Manhattan Moods"
goes live to our feature...

01:28:05.375 --> 01:28:07.083
"Luncheon at Le Bijou."

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:12.792
Hi, I'm Robin Simon.
Welcome to Le Bijou...

01:28:13.042 --> 01:28:15.333
New York's most
exciting restaurant...

01:28:15.542 --> 01:28:18.125
where every day is a
potpourri of the city's...

01:28:18.333 --> 01:28:21.958
most rich and
famous residents.

01:28:22.208 --> 01:28:25.167
I'm sitting here
talking to Evelyn Isaacs...

01:28:25.375 --> 01:28:28.083
Manhattan's most exclusive
real estate broker.

01:28:28.292 --> 01:28:29.875
The woman who has situated...

01:28:30.083 --> 01:28:32.292
- Is that correct?
- I like it.

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.875
The cream of the city's
most luminous residents.

01:28:36.083 --> 01:28:39.458
You were saying you couldn't
get rock star Ennis Taylor...

01:28:39.667 --> 01:28:41.417
into the apartment
he wanted.

01:28:41.625 --> 01:28:45.292
The tenants didn't want the press
and groupies hanging around.

01:28:45.667 --> 01:28:47.917
Must've been leery of wild parties.

01:28:48.167 --> 01:28:51.542
Yes, but Ennis is not what
you'd think from his band.

01:28:51.792 --> 01:28:55.792
He's not violent or destructive,
he's intellectual and sweet.

01:28:56.125 --> 01:28:59.542
But the board of the co-op
had a problem with his snakes.

01:28:59.792 --> 01:29:03.292
They had a problem with
the boa constrictor.

01:29:03.625 --> 01:29:05.333
Any other big name turndowns?

01:29:05.542 --> 01:29:08.583
No, but I got a beautiful triplex
for the Charles Aranows,

01:29:08.792 --> 01:29:12.458
12 rooms on Park Avenue, and they
made one into a Hamptons room.

01:29:12.708 --> 01:29:16.583
Tons of sand from Amagansett
to cover the floor. It's fun!

01:29:17.042 --> 01:29:18.833
Well, thank you. I see.

01:29:19.583 --> 01:29:21.083
It's time to table-hop...

01:29:21.333 --> 01:29:23.958
so we can meet some of
the other exciting patrons...

01:29:24.167 --> 01:29:26.708
who lunch typically at
Le Bijou.

01:29:27.125 --> 01:29:29.958
Look who's here. Senator Bob
Paley! How are you?

01:29:30.208 --> 01:29:32.417
We're here for the celebrity
golf tournament.

01:29:32.625 --> 01:29:34.750
I play every year and
it's a good cause...

01:29:34.958 --> 01:29:36.917
earning money for
the Heart Foundation.

01:29:37.125 --> 01:29:39.208
They say I'll be paired
with Greg Norman.

01:29:39.417 --> 01:29:40.750
Wonderful!

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.958
Any comments about
the recent allegations?

01:29:44.167 --> 01:29:48.000
I think when the facts are in, the
Justice Department will find...

01:29:48.208 --> 01:29:52.000
I made an error of judgement,
without real intent of treason.

01:29:52.208 --> 01:29:53.500
Moving right along...

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:57.333
I see Dee Bartholemew,
"Empress of Gossip".

01:29:57.625 --> 01:30:02.292
Robin, hi. So rainy out today.
Just this gloomy weather.

01:30:02.667 --> 01:30:06.167
But I love your pin.
Is that Georgian?

01:30:06.417 --> 01:30:08.708
Thank you. No,
it's Art Nouveau.

01:30:08.917 --> 01:30:10.458
Where'd you get it?

01:30:10.667 --> 01:30:13.625
My first husband gave me it for
our 15th wedding anniversary.

01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:17.833
When you say "first", do
I sense a second on the way?

01:30:18.417 --> 01:30:21.917
I ran into Tony Gardella
at the Café Carlyle.

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:26.208
He had a blissed-out look,
like he was in heaven.

01:30:26.667 --> 01:30:30.042
How'd you manage to put
that smile on his face?

01:30:31.625 --> 01:30:33.083
Using my head.

01:30:33.917 --> 01:30:36.875
Any choice items
for our viewers?

01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:40.208
Very prominent
actress/singer...

01:30:40.458 --> 01:30:43.500
has become pregnant on
visiting Buckingham Palace.

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:45.375
No names, please.

01:30:45.583 --> 01:30:47.083
Well, thank you.

01:30:49.333 --> 01:30:51.583
Look who's here!
Donald Trump.

01:30:51.833 --> 01:30:53.417
What are you working on?

01:30:53.625 --> 01:30:55.917
I'm working on buying
St Patrick's Cathedral...

01:30:56.167 --> 01:30:57.708
doing a little rip-down job...

01:30:57.917 --> 01:31:00.625
and putting up a tall,
beautiful building.

01:31:00.833 --> 01:31:02.333
That's wonderful!

01:31:02.792 --> 01:31:04.333
- You were great!
- Terrible!

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:07.750
You said you couldn't do it.
And I said, "Yes, you can."

01:31:08.042 --> 01:31:10.167
No actress-turned-
interviewer...

01:31:10.417 --> 01:31:12.625
- could do it as real as you did.
- I was a jerk.

01:31:12.833 --> 01:31:15.042
You're not a jerk.
You were real!

01:31:15.250 --> 01:31:18.708
No-one cares if it's unpolished.
They find it appealing.

01:31:18.917 --> 01:31:20.875
It's your 15 minutes of fame.

01:31:21.125 --> 01:31:22.917
I never believed what
Andy Warhol said...

01:31:23.167 --> 01:31:27.042
that we're all famous for 15
minutes. Nice, but it's not true.

01:31:27.333 --> 01:31:30.833
Almost nobody will ever be
famous for even one minute.

01:31:31.167 --> 01:31:32.708
So enjoy it!

01:31:32.958 --> 01:31:34.875
How did I swing this?

01:31:35.125 --> 01:31:39.458
Last year I was teaching English,
performing a serious function.

01:31:39.708 --> 01:31:42.750
And suddenly, through a
whirlwind series of events...

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.375
I become the sort of woman I've
always hated. But I'm happier.

01:31:47.583 --> 01:31:49.625
You nervous
about Saturday?

01:31:49.875 --> 01:31:50.792
Are you?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.500
I'm counting the seconds.

01:31:56.458 --> 01:31:58.333
My hands are sweating.
I never sweat.

01:31:58.542 --> 01:32:00.792
- Got the ring?
- What am I, a schmuck? Sure!

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.292
Sophisticated. Very
educated. She sure is!

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:05.458
Oh, picture!

01:32:06.583 --> 01:32:09.917
I like this girl.
I think she's terrific.

01:32:10.375 --> 01:32:13.542
It's ironic.
You go to get face work...

01:32:13.792 --> 01:32:16.125
and you meet a wonderful
guy who changes your life.

01:32:16.333 --> 01:32:18.083
Better than face work.

01:32:18.417 --> 01:32:21.792
- Think this looks okay?
- You look perfect.

01:32:22.125 --> 01:32:23.583
I expected a bigger turnout.

01:32:23.792 --> 01:32:25.750
Ma, they wanted to keep it small.

01:32:26.833 --> 01:32:28.125
Isn't that...?

01:32:28.708 --> 01:32:30.250
Al Swayze, a
friend of Tony's.

01:32:30.458 --> 01:32:32.417
- Yeah, he...
- Does the weather.

01:32:32.833 --> 01:32:35.500
Right, he does the weather
on channel...

01:32:35.792 --> 01:32:37.500
Hello, how'd you do?

01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:39.208
Congratulations.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.042
Thank you. My daughter, Iris.

01:32:41.333 --> 01:32:44.417
So glad to meet you.
We enjoy your program.

01:32:44.667 --> 01:32:46.083
Really? Nice to meet you too.

01:32:46.375 --> 01:32:48.292
We watch you
give the weather.

01:32:48.542 --> 01:32:50.417
You're usually wrong.

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.167
Occupational hazard, y'know?

01:32:53.375 --> 01:32:56.833
But you're cheerful.
You're all so cheerful.

01:33:38.375 --> 01:33:40.708
I can't find her.
Did you see her?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.042
Did I...?

01:33:42.792 --> 01:33:45.000
- What happened?
- She's not in the bathroom.

01:33:45.958 --> 01:33:49.042
- You were with her.
- I don't know what happened to her.

01:33:49.333 --> 01:33:50.958
Frankie, come on.

01:33:51.417 --> 01:33:52.250
Relax.

01:33:52.458 --> 01:33:55.083
How can I relax?
She's gotta be here.

01:33:56.792 --> 01:33:59.667
- What's going on?
- It's all right, Ma. Nothing.

01:33:59.917 --> 01:34:01.792
I'm sure it'll all turn out okay.

01:34:02.042 --> 01:34:04.375
She walked out,
alone. 15, 20 minutes ago.

01:34:04.583 --> 01:34:06.083
- Where'd she go?
- I didn't see.

01:34:06.292 --> 01:34:08.458
- You sure she was alone?
- Absolutely.

01:34:08.667 --> 01:34:11.625
Frankie, go up and stall them.
I'm gonna look around.

01:34:11.833 --> 01:34:13.958
- Where?
- I don't know!

01:34:14.208 --> 01:34:17.583
You're out of your mind.
What'll I tell your parents?

01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:26.875
- Everything's fine.
- I hope she's all right.

01:34:27.167 --> 01:34:29.042
- What's going on?
- She's nervous, Ma.

01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:32.208
She needs time
to fix her makeup.

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:33.708
Should I go help her?

01:34:33.917 --> 01:34:35.792
- Tony's all right?
- Please don't go help her.

01:34:36.083 --> 01:34:38.917
She'll come out.
Iris, just leave her alone.

01:34:39.167 --> 01:34:41.042
She's gathering herself.

01:34:47.917 --> 01:34:50.125
Olga PS YCHIC READER
AND ADVISER

01:34:53.792 --> 01:34:55.583
Want a reading?

01:34:55.792 --> 01:34:57.042
Come on inside.

01:34:57.250 --> 01:34:59.375
- I'll give you a nice reading.
- No, I'm just walking.

01:34:59.583 --> 01:35:01.250
You look like you need a reading.

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.708
- Really?
- Come inside.

01:35:03.917 --> 01:35:06.417
- Come on in.
- I don't believe in psychics.

01:35:06.917 --> 01:35:09.667
You don't have to
for a reading.

01:35:10.542 --> 01:35:12.042
So what do you do?

01:35:12.292 --> 01:35:13.958
I work in television.

01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:16.458
But you used to do something else?

01:35:16.792 --> 01:35:18.792
Yes, I was a teacher.

01:35:20.083 --> 01:35:21.417
I see...

01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:23.667
the name Beowulf.

01:35:23.875 --> 01:35:24.875
Oh my God!

01:35:25.083 --> 01:35:27.167
Chaucer! I
taught Chaucer.

01:35:27.708 --> 01:35:31.417
- Like some tea? Mint tea?
- I would love a drink.

01:35:32.167 --> 01:35:34.750
I got a drink for you.
No problem.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.375
So you like television better?

01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:41.708
It's interesting to see who we
choose as our celebrities, and why.

01:35:42.542 --> 01:35:44.167
What makes them tick.

01:35:44.375 --> 01:35:47.167
You learn a lot about a society
by who it celebrates.

01:35:47.458 --> 01:35:48.958
- Is this good?
- Yes, please.

01:35:49.208 --> 01:35:52.042
Like, we did this show
on Sunny Von Bulow...

01:35:52.292 --> 01:35:54.042
and she's a coma patient.

01:35:54.292 --> 01:35:56.667
She lies there in a coma...

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.292
but she's a celebrity.

01:35:59.208 --> 01:36:01.375
You were up there with
her. What happened?

01:36:01.583 --> 01:36:03.292
She was okay. A little nervous.

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.583
Listen, I've got
bad news.

01:36:05.792 --> 01:36:06.792
Here he is.

01:36:07.083 --> 01:36:10.667
The wedding's off, so
why don't you all go home?

01:36:11.125 --> 01:36:12.125
Thank you.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.875
It's not gonna happen, Iris.

01:36:16.292 --> 01:36:19.083
Just go home. Make sure
Mom gets there.

01:36:19.833 --> 01:36:22.208
Are you all right?
Is she hurt?

01:36:22.417 --> 01:36:24.458
No, nothing like that. Just go on.

01:36:24.708 --> 01:36:26.125
- Thanks.
- I'll be home.

01:36:26.333 --> 01:36:28.458
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:37.792
It's all right. Just...

01:36:38.875 --> 01:36:41.292
I'm here to help you.
Whatever.

01:36:51.375 --> 01:36:53.250
You need a change
in your life.

01:36:53.458 --> 01:36:56.417
You must reevaluate the
plans you were contemplating.

01:36:56.625 --> 01:37:00.333
- I see you change your direction.
- I had planned to get married.

01:37:00.667 --> 01:37:02.750
Perhaps it needs more scrutiny
before you decide.

01:37:03.042 --> 01:37:04.208
Really?

01:37:04.458 --> 01:37:06.625
- When was the wedding?
- Today.

01:37:08.042 --> 01:37:10.708
I left him at the church with
his family and friends.

01:37:10.917 --> 01:37:13.125
My God! What have
I done? I don't know!

01:37:13.333 --> 01:37:16.542
If you're not sure you love him,
it's a mistake to go forward.

01:37:16.792 --> 01:37:19.500
- I am sure. He's wonderful.
- So then I don't understand.

01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:22.792
I feel guilty because I've
had such good luck.

01:37:23.042 --> 01:37:24.958
Everyone I know has
so many problems.

01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:29.208
They're lonely, needy. I
have this guy fall in my lap.

01:37:29.917 --> 01:37:31.125
I still don't get it.

01:37:31.333 --> 01:37:34.000
His name's Tony, and
I said, "You're terrific!"

01:37:34.208 --> 01:37:36.000
"When will the other shoe drop?"

01:37:36.458 --> 01:37:40.292
Some bad part of him that'll ruin things.
But there is no bad part.

01:37:40.708 --> 01:37:42.417
- Well, you provided that.
- Me?

01:37:42.625 --> 01:37:45.625
He's a wonderful guy, but
you screwed things up.

01:37:45.833 --> 01:37:46.833
Why?

01:37:47.125 --> 01:37:50.125
You said it yourself.
It's guilt.

01:37:50.375 --> 01:37:52.833
You don't need a fortune
teller. You need a shrink.

01:37:53.042 --> 01:37:55.625
- Me?
- You meet this wonderful guy, okay?

01:37:55.875 --> 01:37:59.042
You can't believe something so wonderful
can happen to you.

01:37:59.333 --> 01:38:01.292
So you ruin it.

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:04.750
I did a horrible thing.
He'll never forgive me.

01:38:05.083 --> 01:38:06.500
Who could blame him?

01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:09.250
You want your $10 of
psychic prediction?

01:38:09.458 --> 01:38:12.542
He's going to forgive you.
Obviously, he's crazy about you.

01:38:12.792 --> 01:38:16.917
Just because you've acted like a
horse's ass doesn't mean he will.

01:38:17.167 --> 01:38:20.000
So you tell him
everything you told me...

01:38:20.292 --> 01:38:21.792
and then...

01:38:22.042 --> 01:38:23.500
you give him a big kiss.

01:38:35.208 --> 01:38:36.583
We can be seen...

01:38:37.583 --> 01:38:39.083
or don't you care?

01:38:40.542 --> 01:38:41.708
I don't.

01:38:42.292 --> 01:38:44.125
I care about you.

01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:48.625
Perfect.

01:38:49.833 --> 01:38:53.292
Emotionally it's exactly
where you should be.

01:38:54.375 --> 01:38:56.458
I don't feel I'm there at all.

01:38:56.792 --> 01:38:59.208
Trust it. We'll come
back to it tomorrow.

01:38:59.417 --> 01:39:02.250
We'll stop now and
continue from here tomorrow.

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:06.417
I feel I know where she's coming
from, but she's contradictory.

01:39:08.292 --> 01:39:12.083
Contradiction is good. Just don't
contradict yourself when you act.

01:39:12.458 --> 01:39:15.208
Play one thing
at a time and trust it.

01:39:15.792 --> 01:39:19.667
You have a hold on it.
Just don't look in the mirror.

01:39:20.792 --> 01:39:22.167
Both of you.

01:39:22.375 --> 01:39:24.417
Don't overplay the lust.

01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:27.375
I know. She's a carnivore.

01:39:29.625 --> 01:39:32.667
- Wanna have a drink?
- Yeah, love to.

01:39:33.208 --> 01:39:34.583
We'll talk.

01:39:36.458 --> 01:39:38.083
I just caught the ending.

01:39:38.292 --> 01:39:41.167
Seems like a terrific scene.
It's great work.

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:44.667
- You didn't say you were coming.
- I was in the neighbourhood.

01:39:44.875 --> 01:39:46.875
Thought I'd stop by to pick you up.

01:39:47.125 --> 01:39:48.667
You know Greg.

01:39:48.917 --> 01:39:51.083
- How you doing?
- Good to see you again.

01:39:51.292 --> 01:39:55.000
- Going to Moran's round the corner.
- Do you wanna have that drink?

01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:59.000
- I thought we'd walk home together.
- I want to talk to Greg.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.125
- Thought you might want to walk.
- You know I'm in rehearsal!

01:40:03.375 --> 01:40:06.792
I knew you'd be through by 5,
so what's the big deal?

01:40:07.375 --> 01:40:10.958
I'm going to the bar, but
we can talk tomorrow.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.833
- Don't crowd me! It's annoying.
- I'm not!

01:40:16.042 --> 01:40:18.708
I came to pick you up.
Thought you'd be glad to see me.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.792
- Things come up!
- Something's very wrong.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.917
I stop by and it puts
you in a bad mood.

01:40:23.125 --> 01:40:25.917
- It's because you don't trust me.
- Should I?

01:40:26.125 --> 01:40:29.917
- Suspicious, that's your problem.
- You wanna sleep with the director.

01:40:30.583 --> 01:40:34.458
- I'm not in the mood to argue.
- You said you loved me!

01:40:34.917 --> 01:40:36.833
Why do you want me if
you don't trust me?

01:40:37.042 --> 01:40:39.875
How can I? I turn my back
and you're off with someone.

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:42.875
I already told you, I
don't want to be closed in.

01:40:43.125 --> 01:40:46.292
- So why are you living with me?
- I'm not! I've got an apartment.

01:40:46.542 --> 01:40:49.042
- I just stay over most nights.
- I don't want to crowd you.

01:40:49.250 --> 01:40:53.167
Let me get a drink and
go talk about the play.

01:40:53.375 --> 01:40:56.875
"Fuck off so I can fuck the
director." I understand.

01:40:57.125 --> 01:40:59.875
I am who I am. I told
you that when we met.

01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:02.208
I always hope it'll be
different, but it never is.

01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:05.625
You love me and you'll be hurt
if I give up on you.

01:41:05.833 --> 01:41:07.667
So think about this.

01:41:08.125 --> 01:41:09.708
Just go home.

01:41:10.083 --> 01:41:13.042
We'll just enjoy the
time we have together...

01:41:13.375 --> 01:41:14.958
and not complicate everything.

01:41:15.167 --> 01:41:17.083
Everything doesn't
have to be questioned.

01:41:17.375 --> 01:41:21.042
You're still saying, "Get lost
so I can sleep with the director."

01:41:21.333 --> 01:41:24.458
Anyone would think I was
the whore of TriBeCa.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.542
So would you be happy if I said
goodbye and never saw you again?

01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:30.958
That wouldn't make me happy.

01:41:31.167 --> 01:41:34.625
We haven't made love
in weeks. What is that?

01:41:34.833 --> 01:41:38.000
Why do you want me, when I
just lie there like a dead fish?

01:41:38.250 --> 01:41:41.167
But you didn't used to.
What happened?

01:41:41.417 --> 01:41:42.333
Nothing.

01:41:42.583 --> 01:41:43.708
It's me, okay.

01:41:44.125 --> 01:41:48.042
It's me. Let's just stay in tonight
and not over-analyse everything?

01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:53.833
What is it with the pills?

01:41:54.083 --> 01:41:56.833
- Diet pills.
- Oh, please!

01:42:04.417 --> 01:42:05.750
I give up.

01:42:08.292 --> 01:42:11.292
So what do you want for dinner?
What should I buy?

01:42:12.667 --> 01:42:13.917
Spaghetti.

01:42:16.958 --> 01:42:19.208
I was going to ask
you to marry me.

01:42:20.250 --> 01:42:21.500
No, penne...

01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:23.458
with marinara.

01:42:34.917 --> 01:42:36.208
Lee, right?

01:42:36.417 --> 01:42:39.708
Phil Datloff. Bonnie brought
you to a party at my apartment.

01:42:40.042 --> 01:42:43.917
Sure I remember you. You were very
kind. I passed out on your carpet.

01:42:44.417 --> 01:42:46.125
- That I remember.
- That's right.

01:42:46.333 --> 01:42:48.833
What happened to the book
you were toying with?

01:42:49.042 --> 01:42:50.250
It just kind of...

01:42:50.458 --> 01:42:51.625
floated away.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.250
I thought about it the other day.

01:42:54.583 --> 01:42:56.875
A culture that took a wrong
turn somewhere.

01:42:57.083 --> 01:42:59.417
A flawed individual who
can't find himself.

01:42:59.667 --> 01:43:00.875
That was my book.

01:43:01.083 --> 01:43:04.167
Because V.J. Rajnipal,
a great writer...

01:43:04.375 --> 01:43:07.750
just gave us a manuscript
on the same subject.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.375
Really, the same subject?

01:43:09.625 --> 01:43:12.125
A society where every single
member is famous.

01:43:12.333 --> 01:43:14.542
There are no uncelebrated people.

01:43:14.833 --> 01:43:16.042
Very satirical.

01:43:17.083 --> 01:43:20.333
I'd like to have seen your
take on the same subject.

01:43:20.542 --> 01:43:21.958
He's a great artist.

01:43:22.167 --> 01:43:23.667
I could never...

01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:28.708
- How's Bonnie?
- Fine. Great girl.

01:43:29.375 --> 01:43:31.458
I think she sold
a screenplay.

01:43:34.292 --> 01:43:38.250
We're at the star-spangled
première of "The Liquidator".

01:43:39.583 --> 01:43:43.000
Unfortunately for the beautiful
people, the weather hasn't held up.

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:46.500
But the show must go on.
Here's producer, Dalton Freed.

01:43:46.750 --> 01:43:50.417
- Can you believe the weather?
- Unbelievable. How you doing?

01:43:51.167 --> 01:43:52.750
Could be better.

01:43:53.042 --> 01:43:55.500
Hasn't kept people away.
Is this your wife?

01:43:55.792 --> 01:43:59.458
This is a young actress you'll
be hearing a lot about.

01:43:59.750 --> 01:44:01.750
My wife, you know,
she's in rehab.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.708
I've read the reviews.
Very interesting!

01:44:04.917 --> 01:44:07.583
- I never read reviews.
- And your next project?

01:44:07.792 --> 01:44:10.333
"Birth of a Nation", an
all-black version.

01:44:10.542 --> 01:44:11.667
Can't wait.

01:44:11.875 --> 01:44:15.875
Oh my gosh, Erno DeLucca,
who did Nicole Olivier's wigs!

01:44:17.125 --> 01:44:19.250
I also did her werewolf makeup.

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.458
- Werewolf?
- Yes, twice.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.167
- Good job. Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

01:44:24.417 --> 01:44:28.333
There'll be lots of big celebrities
tonight. I'll keep my eyes peeled.

01:44:29.083 --> 01:44:31.042
Here's the director. How are you?

01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:32.583
What a night!

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:36.333
Incredible, like a typhoon. Are
you from the weather channel?

01:44:37.292 --> 01:44:41.292
I hear in your film you actually
have a big rain sequence.

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:45.167
We have amazing effects,
almost like the real thing.

01:44:45.417 --> 01:44:46.833
Actually, they're better.

01:44:47.083 --> 01:44:48.875
Thank you. Enjoy your night.

01:44:49.167 --> 01:44:51.708
We'll be rooting for it.
I'm really excited about it.

01:44:52.167 --> 01:44:53.875
Nicole Oliver! Here she is!

01:44:54.083 --> 01:44:56.708
One of the stars
with her husband.

01:44:56.917 --> 01:44:59.167
You look beautiful. Show us
what you're wearing.

01:44:59.542 --> 01:45:00.792
I'm soaked.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.583
Unbelievable. You look great.

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:06.708
The lights, the ambience,
the greasepaint...

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.208
You can't swing a cat
without hitting a celebrity.

01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:12.792
And the rain didn't
seem to deter many people.

01:45:13.125 --> 01:45:15.375
I'm really excited.
The big première!

01:45:15.583 --> 01:45:18.667
Oh my gosh! Robin Simon
from "Manhattan Moods"!

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.875
Congratulations on your show,
your pregnancy, marriage, everything.

01:45:23.208 --> 01:45:24.583
Doesn't she look beautiful?

01:45:24.833 --> 01:45:27.167
Who knew angels flew so low?
Unbelievable.

01:45:27.458 --> 01:45:31.375
Your show's taken off, and I'm
jealous. What about the rain?

01:45:31.958 --> 01:45:33.667
- It's really something.
- It is!

01:45:33.917 --> 01:45:36.542
Listen, have a great time.
You look incredible!

01:45:37.083 --> 01:45:39.208
We got more people coming.

01:45:39.417 --> 01:45:40.542
I see Sandor!

01:45:43.208 --> 01:45:44.958
We feel sorry for him.

01:45:45.958 --> 01:45:47.167
My goodness!

01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:54.542
- What are you doing...?
- Incredible!

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.458
I haven't seen you for...
At the movies again!

01:45:59.417 --> 01:46:01.333
This is my husband, Tony.

01:46:01.583 --> 01:46:05.292
Nice to meet you.
Congratulations on everything.

01:46:05.875 --> 01:46:08.750
- You're transformed!
- Such a surprise.

01:46:09.042 --> 01:46:13.000
- It's not your kind of movie.
- I interviewed Nicole Olivier.

01:46:13.458 --> 01:46:15.375
I read the interview.
It was marvelous.

01:46:16.042 --> 01:46:19.458
Marvelous? Didn't that used to
be your least-favourite word?

01:46:19.667 --> 01:46:21.917
- Stop it!
- Those crossword puzzles.

01:46:22.917 --> 01:46:24.875
- Want some popcorn?
- I'd love some.

01:46:25.167 --> 01:46:27.000
- Want a bag?
- That'd be great.

01:46:27.208 --> 01:46:28.583
I can't believe...

01:46:30.167 --> 01:46:31.958
Have I become insufferable?

01:46:32.208 --> 01:46:35.625
- No, happy, confident and radiant.
- I am happy.

01:46:36.417 --> 01:46:38.917
- Hi, Jack. Good to see you.
- Great article.

01:46:39.125 --> 01:46:41.667
Robin Simon, I'm so excited
to meet you in person.

01:46:41.875 --> 01:46:43.000
Thank you, darling.

01:46:43.250 --> 01:46:45.708
I love your show.
Such a great broadcaster.

01:46:45.958 --> 01:46:46.958
Aren't you sweet!

01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:49.542
- God bless you.
- God bless you.

01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:51.542
You're so radiant.

01:46:52.417 --> 01:46:55.292
- Thank you. It's luck, Lee.
- Really?

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:59.167
No matter what the shrinks
and self-help books tell you.

01:46:59.542 --> 01:47:01.875
Love is a question of luck.

01:47:08.292 --> 01:47:10.208
I'm glad you were lucky.

01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:11.875
You with anyone?

01:47:12.083 --> 01:47:13.792
Not at the moment.

01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:16.792
- What are you working on?
- Just the same...

01:47:17.083 --> 01:47:18.750
A novel? A screenplay?

01:47:19.708 --> 01:47:23.708
I did a huge interview at the old
actor's home. Very touching.

01:47:24.083 --> 01:47:27.208
My Uncle Willie's there.
He asked about the autograph.

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:30.958
We did a report from
Charlie Manson's jail cell.

01:47:31.292 --> 01:47:34.917
- So interesting.
- My nephew wanted his autograph.

01:47:35.417 --> 01:47:37.750
- Oh, dear.
- Next time we're in California.

01:47:38.625 --> 01:47:40.250
Here. Here you go.

01:47:40.458 --> 01:47:42.792
Thanks for...
I don't want to hold you up.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.958
Just, you know, it's really...

01:47:46.583 --> 01:47:49.208
- And very nice to...
- Great to see you, Lee.

01:47:49.417 --> 01:47:53.125
Really great to see you.
Hope you catch a break.
