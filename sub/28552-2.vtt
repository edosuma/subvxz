WEBVTT

00:00.729 --> 00:02.820
Now, here's the amazing part!

00:03.042 --> 00:04.335
The vascular cambium displays

00:04.478 --> 00:05.648
three distinct growth rings

00:05.791 --> 00:07.073
the exact same
distance apart.

00:07.279 --> 00:09.335
Factoring out drought deformity
means this tree

00:09.478 --> 00:12.453
Scrooge found experienced
three leap years in a row!

00:13.666 --> 00:16.133
You dragged me
out of the bath for this?

00:16.680 --> 00:18.461
What are you doing now?

00:22.213 --> 00:25.539
Tasting for resin samples.
They can... Ow! Splinter.

00:25.682 --> 00:28.859
I said, don't interrupt me unless
something exciting happens.

00:29.002 --> 00:32.351
What's more exciting
than dendrochronology?

00:32.494 --> 00:33.987
Ghouls, goblins,
time paradoxes,

00:34.065 --> 00:36.248
daring quests that will
cement our names in history.

00:36.326 --> 00:37.943
- You get the idea.
<i>-  Brring!</i>

00:38.095 --> 00:40.531
<i>Brring, brr-brr-brring!</i>

00:41.146 --> 00:43.531
<i>Answer me, please.
Brring! Brring!</i>

00:43.674 --> 00:46.594
What are you kids doing
mucking about in my office?

00:46.737 --> 00:49.188
Ah. See, the vascular
cambium displays...

00:49.340 --> 00:51.984
More importantly,
your... can is ringing.

00:52.127 --> 00:54.400
Tatter me tartan!

00:54.627 --> 00:56.650
Do not answer that.

00:57.463 --> 00:59.346
That can is
your Cousin Fethry

00:59.498 --> 01:01.633
calling from my top-secret
deep-sea laboratory.

01:01.785 --> 01:04.036
- Top secret?
- Deep-sea laboratory?

01:04.188 --> 01:06.672
Don't get too excited.
Fethry's a bit...

01:06.824 --> 01:10.515
- Well, he's um...
- He's cuckoo bananas.

01:10.658 --> 01:13.393
Best to ignore it. Every time
we get a call from Fethry,

01:13.545 --> 01:15.848
we rush down there just to go
on some fool's errand

01:15.992 --> 01:17.476
wrapped up in a needlessly

01:17.578 --> 01:18.947
dangerous adventure.

01:19.025 --> 01:22.172
- With the rambling lectures.
- And the explosions.

01:22.315 --> 01:23.856
And avoiding
that mega-tsunami.

01:24.008 --> 01:25.939
And the explosions...

01:26.091 --> 01:28.475
All to see
a barnacle formation

01:28.627 --> 01:31.363
in the shape of a tractor
or some such nonsense.

01:31.515 --> 01:34.550
- Big waste of time.
<i>- Brring!</i>

02:47.773 --> 02:50.442
The treacherous
high seas. The abyss.

02:50.594 --> 02:51.692
The big blue.

02:51.844 --> 02:53.509
I call it
the underwater sky.

02:53.777 --> 02:56.736
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the longest
ocean mountain range in the world,

02:56.934 --> 02:59.800
- home to... Ooh!
- Forbidden beasts of the deep!

02:59.952 --> 03:02.955
And our very own cousin is the
scientist exploring it all!

03:03.184 --> 03:06.939
Perhaps he'll discover a bold new
species he'll name after me.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.962
<i>Dewificus Magnificus.</i>
No, no, wait.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.897
The Great Blue Dewfin.

03:12.049 --> 03:13.395
Hmm...

03:14.051 --> 03:15.167
Meh.
I'm over-thinking it.

03:15.402 --> 03:17.084
How about the Dewfish?

03:17.238 --> 03:19.994
There's already a Dewfish, commonly
known as the freshwater catfish.

03:20.257 --> 03:21.922
Ew, gross. No.

03:22.098 --> 03:24.228
Gotta fix that and give
the name to something cooler.

03:24.848 --> 03:26.119
<i>Launchpad!</i>

03:26.293 --> 03:27.548
<i>Did you steal...</i>

03:28.047 --> 03:29.915
Oops. Look, it's broken.
Look at that.

03:30.067 --> 03:32.532
Radio came right off.
Hubert, write that down.

03:32.684 --> 03:34.920
Good thing Uncle Scrooge
asked us to do this

03:35.072 --> 03:37.871
totally non-suspicious trip
to test the equipment.

03:38.023 --> 03:39.769
You bet. Could you
imagine if that had

03:39.912 --> 03:41.587
happened when we were
in actual danger?

03:41.730 --> 03:43.996
Heh.
Anyway,

03:44.196 --> 03:47.833
do you want me to pull up next to the
rusty, haunted lighthouse, or...

03:48.215 --> 03:49.901
what'd you want me to do?

03:55.900 --> 03:58.751
Good start to an adventure.
I'm liking this.

03:58.934 --> 04:01.720
Hey, up here!
It's me, from the can!

04:01.999 --> 04:02.934
Come on up!

04:03.301 --> 04:05.917
All right, let's go
meet a genius!

04:10.207 --> 04:12.633
<i>Launchpad.</i>

04:12.776 --> 04:15.108
<i>Oh, Launchpad!</i>

04:15.260 --> 04:18.384
Oceanika?
Is that you, my love?

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:28.533 --> 04:30.304
Cousin Fethry?

04:32.878 --> 04:34.749
- What the...
- Warning!

04:34.892 --> 04:37.085
Never drink seawater!

04:37.228 --> 04:39.616
Tempting as it is,
it'll just make you thirstier.

04:39.776 --> 04:43.486
Hooray, Little Donalds! You are here!

04:44.776 --> 04:46.358
Were you performing
some kind of experiment

04:46.509 --> 04:48.015
on the effect of
gravity on sponges?

04:48.158 --> 04:50.296
I was just decompressing from all

04:50.439 --> 04:52.412
the deep-sea pressure
on the, uh...

04:52.564 --> 04:54.866
Oh, what's that thing that
does the thinking... brain!

04:55.009 --> 04:57.952
I'm Fethry, your Uncle
Donald's favorite cousin!

04:58.095 --> 04:59.418
Yeah.

04:59.505 --> 05:02.007
- He sends his love.
- So why the decoy?

05:02.159 --> 05:03.924
Decoy... Oh, Arturo.

05:04.076 --> 05:05.687
He's just here
to scare pirates.

05:05.830 --> 05:08.741
- Do you get pirates here a lot?
- Never. He's that good.

05:08.884 --> 05:10.335
- Huh.
- We haven't had an outsider

05:10.478 --> 05:13.734
at the lab in years!
Great to see you!

05:14.820 --> 05:16.695
I like your hat.

05:17.990 --> 05:19.037
So,

05:19.124 --> 05:21.375
did you have a big
discovery to show us?

05:21.527 --> 05:24.632
Perhaps something big and awesome
in need of a big, awesome name?

05:24.875 --> 05:28.913
You want to see something?
I mean, really see something?

05:29.119 --> 05:30.882
Uh, yes?

05:31.072 --> 05:33.071
Then follow me,
eager minds,

05:33.223 --> 05:36.890
to liquid space,
the silent habitat!

05:40.679 --> 05:42.447
Dive! Dive!

05:45.598 --> 05:48.484
Presenting man's
niftiest invention...

05:48.627 --> 05:50.210
The aqua-vator.

05:51.814 --> 05:54.562
Ahoy, explorers!
As we descend,

05:54.705 --> 05:57.062
we ask you to keep your hands
and arms inside the vehicle.

05:57.205 --> 06:00.398
No flash photography.
And watch your children. please.

06:00.699 --> 06:04.002
Uh, we are children. -Oh. Well,
then ignore everything I just said.

06:04.154 --> 06:06.109
Let us be the first
to welcome you to...

06:06.252 --> 06:08.523
the McDuck Sublab
of the Future!

06:08.676 --> 06:13.454
The Sublab of the Future was
actually built in the past: 1964.

06:13.597 --> 06:16.405
The goal: to explore
the un-explorable.

06:16.548 --> 06:18.451
We have the Tully
Observatory, where we do all

06:18.658 --> 06:20.095
our science-y projects
and what have you.

06:20.237 --> 06:23.179
Five-star cafeteria.
Indoor Jai alai court.

06:23.322 --> 06:25.507
Outdoor Jai alai court.
Less popular.

06:25.650 --> 06:27.919
And my little addition:
the Dream Room.

06:28.178 --> 06:30.210
Great for naps,
relaxation,

06:30.362 --> 06:32.631
embracing
the unending darkness,

06:32.783 --> 06:35.693
becoming one
with the abyss-s-s.

06:36.401 --> 06:39.461
You're in a for a real treat,
Little Donalds.

06:39.539 --> 06:42.265
Set your minds to wonder.

06:43.540 --> 06:45.877
Wow. This guy kind of
sounds like you.

06:46.029 --> 06:47.608
Genius?
Visionary?

06:47.751 --> 06:49.530
In charge of a massive
research facility?

06:49.673 --> 06:50.623
Hmm.

06:53.719 --> 06:56.488
Weird. You're both
really into weird stuff.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.623
Oh, you've found
one of your own.

07:04.096 --> 07:07.299
Behold the world's
best-kept secret...

07:08.400 --> 07:09.633
The ocean!

07:11.203 --> 07:13.085
It's horrible!

07:13.972 --> 07:16.382
It's actually
pretty majestic...

07:16.656 --> 07:18.410
from an
evolutionary standpoint.

07:18.562 --> 07:20.845
I was hoping to see more
of an apex predator.

07:20.997 --> 07:22.262
A real "Dewey,"
you know?

07:22.414 --> 07:24.049
Well, there's
plenty of ocean,

07:24.201 --> 07:27.052
so take it all in,
become one with it.

07:27.204 --> 07:30.837
Oh. Mm-hmm.
Hmm. Hmm.

07:30.989 --> 07:32.839
What?
Cousin Fethry is doing

07:32.991 --> 07:35.860
what great minds do...
Lose yourself to science.

07:36.012 --> 07:37.911
He's your classic
eccentric genius.

07:38.063 --> 07:40.614
Eccentric genius is the
top rung of scientist!

07:40.766 --> 07:42.305
Don't you know any...

07:42.820 --> 07:45.170
What was that? -It must
be the hydrothermal vents.

07:45.330 --> 07:48.755
- Oh, of course. Yes, yes, yes.
- Volcanic ruptures that blow

07:48.898 --> 07:50.884
toxic minerals into
the ocean's lowest depths.

07:51.027 --> 07:53.028
You do not want
to be around them.

07:58.809 --> 08:02.495
Hmm. The hydrothermal vents
are murking up the water.

08:02.788 --> 08:04.396
We'll need
the help of my team.

08:04.539 --> 08:06.083
See? His team?

08:06.226 --> 08:08.528
A weirdo couldn't run
a team of scientists.

08:08.671 --> 08:10.702
P-P-P-Pit stop!

08:22.627 --> 08:23.748
Got it.

08:27.979 --> 08:30.428
Ah, The Tully Observatory.

08:30.649 --> 08:32.772
Go ahead.
The team's waiting.

08:39.839 --> 08:42.341
Dewey?

08:44.889 --> 08:47.663
Nothing to be afraid of here.
Just wonders of the deep.

08:47.806 --> 08:49.686
Nothing to...

08:58.696 --> 09:00.248
What are these?

09:00.488 --> 09:01.971
Giant sea worms,

09:02.114 --> 09:04.240
mutated from
the toxic vents.

09:04.383 --> 09:06.194
They just want to squeeze
the warmth out of you.

09:06.336 --> 09:07.584
You mean, kill us?

09:07.727 --> 09:10.446
Well, I don't...
Yeah, that'd work.

09:10.589 --> 09:13.673
But they can sense fear.
Just be friendly, affectionate.

09:13.825 --> 09:16.094
Convince them you're not
a threat. Observe.

09:16.246 --> 09:18.011
You are a good,
gentle soul,

09:18.163 --> 09:20.298
and I am honored to be
in your wormy presence.

09:20.450 --> 09:23.168
Oh, who's a good worm?

09:25.937 --> 09:28.788
- Come on, Lil' Donalds.
- You're leaving us?

09:28.940 --> 09:31.866
No, get off! If you kill me, I
will not name you after me.

09:32.009 --> 09:36.529
Ugh. Oh, you are
a sublime... polychaete.

09:36.688 --> 09:38.711
Um, I love you?

09:40.345 --> 09:44.189
It worked! Cousin Fethry was right!
Dewey, just compliment it!

09:44.341 --> 09:46.139
Uh, you're not

09:46.282 --> 09:48.571
the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen?

09:48.883 --> 09:50.076
Dewey!

09:50.154 --> 09:51.384
I love...

09:51.462 --> 09:53.646
how you catch only
the best phytoplankton.

09:53.789 --> 09:55.811
Um, your blood binds
carbon monoxide

09:55.954 --> 09:57.738
much better
than our hemoglobin.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.971
Aah! I'm too panicked
to be sincere!

10:08.238 --> 10:09.771
Blech!

10:15.797 --> 10:19.267
Ha, ha! You kissed
a... a worm.

10:19.490 --> 10:21.321
So... gross.

10:21.464 --> 10:22.977
Donalds?

10:24.425 --> 10:26.711
I'd like you to meet
our distinguished team.

10:26.854 --> 10:28.669
Ooh!

10:30.105 --> 10:32.652
Team, meet Lil' Donalds
One and Two.

10:32.804 --> 10:35.850
Boys, meet Charles, Sylvia,
Cameron, Philippe,

10:36.087 --> 10:38.276
Fish Breath, Simone,
Virgil, Beverly,

10:38.422 --> 10:40.772
Nicholas, Alistair,
Benji, Dr. Krill,

10:40.979 --> 10:42.947
and of course
the ever-feisty Hans.

10:45.984 --> 10:48.134
- That's the team?
- Mm-hmm.

10:48.286 --> 10:51.055
Their natural bioluminescence
can light our way if need be.

10:51.207 --> 10:54.259
It guarantees we always have
a light source as we go deeper.

10:54.411 --> 10:57.811
See? Not weird. Brilliant
and resourceful and...

10:57.963 --> 11:00.686
He's singing to them.

11:15.553 --> 11:18.322
Am I right that this is the
bathypelagic zone we're approaching?

11:18.465 --> 11:19.730
Down here we call it

11:19.873 --> 11:22.875
"the deep, deep total absolute
very, very bottom zone."

11:23.021 --> 11:24.871
It's easier to remember.

11:25.141 --> 11:27.928
Whoa. Like a mirror
into your future.

11:28.134 --> 11:30.595
Come on. I mean, sure,
we're both clearly brilliant,

11:30.747 --> 11:32.312
but we're not that similar.

11:32.464 --> 11:34.265
Okay, okay. You both have
the "nerd out" gene,

11:34.417 --> 11:35.849
you're both obsessed
with weird stuff,

11:36.001 --> 11:37.905
you both wear red caps
that you never take off.

11:38.430 --> 11:40.338
The Junior Woodchuck
Guidebook states

11:40.490 --> 11:43.514
that a warm head breeds
warm, healthy thoughts.

11:43.657 --> 11:45.844
Ah. Always good to see
a fellow Chucker.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.395
I'm not that into
the Junior Woodchucks.

11:48.547 --> 11:50.664
More of a part-time hobby.

11:53.241 --> 11:54.717
End of the line.

11:56.745 --> 11:59.366
No, literally. Something's cut the
cable to the bottom observatory.

12:06.398 --> 12:07.600
What did that?

12:07.743 --> 12:09.849
This whole lab
is falling apart.

12:10.001 --> 12:12.170
Oh, I warned Uncle Scrooge
about the upkeep.

12:12.322 --> 12:14.973
So we don't get to find a
totally awesome new species

12:15.125 --> 12:18.147
and name it Dewfish II:
Dewey's Revenge?

12:21.188 --> 12:24.436
Oh, I can still show you the
findings in my airtight pod.

12:24.579 --> 12:26.461
But we'll have to swim.

12:28.818 --> 12:30.873
We're...
going out there?

12:39.793 --> 12:41.850
Ooh! Watch out
for the vents!

12:51.910 --> 12:55.069

All right, team,
flank out!

13:10.365 --> 13:12.811
Mariners,
our journey continues.

13:14.499 --> 13:17.467
This water is warm.
Oh, Huey!

13:17.649 --> 13:20.530
Hey, that's not me,
it's the hydrothermal vents.

13:49.743 --> 13:52.270
Welcome. I'm still harmonizing
the furniture to the room,

13:52.422 --> 13:54.105
finding that positive
circulation,

13:54.257 --> 13:56.441
working on the sub-aquatic
feng shui.

13:57.743 --> 13:59.158
You live here?

13:59.310 --> 14:01.861
Oh, just for the last
four and half years.

14:02.013 --> 14:04.415
Anyway, the moment
you've been waiting for.

14:04.567 --> 14:06.065
Ugh! It's about time!

14:06.217 --> 14:07.959
A true biological wonder.

14:08.188 --> 14:09.903
You are pioneers,

14:10.055 --> 14:12.209
the first to see
this unbelievable creature.

14:14.210 --> 14:16.838
You must be hungry? Can I make you a
sandwich? Hot soup? How about some...

14:16.980 --> 14:18.936
Just show us
the thing.

14:19.110 --> 14:21.165
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Over here.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.499
Now, just look out there.

14:28.008 --> 14:31.076
And... ta-da!

14:31.298 --> 14:32.764
Is it behind the krill?

14:33.008 --> 14:35.850
It <i> is</i> the krill!
They're all rainbow-y!

14:36.081 --> 14:38.316
I've never seen
anything like it.

14:38.468 --> 14:39.764
Krill?

14:39.851 --> 14:41.491
We stole the sub for krill?

14:41.884 --> 14:43.536
We almost died for krill?

14:43.688 --> 14:45.967
There's an explanation for why
we needed to see this, right?

14:46.109 --> 14:47.774
Some scientific
breakthrough?

14:47.917 --> 14:50.401
I don't know. I just
thought it looked pretty.

14:50.562 --> 14:54.194
- You thought I was a scientist?
- You're not even a scientist?

14:54.337 --> 14:56.616
No. I'm the lab's
caretaker.

14:56.768 --> 14:59.655
Scrooge stationed me here for
upkeep and a little light cleaning.

14:59.821 --> 15:02.756
You see, this pod is kind of
like my broom closet.

15:02.899 --> 15:04.766
I guess you could say
I'm well versed

15:04.844 --> 15:06.920
in the custodial sciences.

15:07.149 --> 15:09.709
We trusted you!
Came all the way down here!

15:09.852 --> 15:12.623
We got attacked by a squid!
I kissed a worm!

15:17.095 --> 15:18.945
This was all
a waste of time.

15:19.090 --> 15:21.569
Okay. All right, cuz,
this has been fun.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.896
Hope we never meet again. Now we
need to get back to dry land,

15:25.039 --> 15:26.920
so can we get to it?

15:27.095 --> 15:28.787
Huh? Hello?

15:29.275 --> 15:32.305
Oh, you're
not going anywhere.

15:32.700 --> 15:35.536
'Cause that monster's gonna eat us!

15:37.709 --> 15:40.778
Now, that is a Dewey!

15:41.194 --> 15:44.219
We have to get out of here!
Follow the team!

16:03.835 --> 16:05.134
Oh!

16:36.367 --> 16:37.686
What is that monster?

16:37.837 --> 16:40.819
And does it have a name,
because wow!

16:41.008 --> 16:44.044
It must've torn through the lab,
and now it's coming for us!

16:44.759 --> 16:46.526
So, you lured us
down here

16:46.678 --> 16:48.835
to get devoured
by a monster. Thanks!

16:48.978 --> 16:51.600
Oh, you're welcome. I...
What? No.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.598
Huh? Oh!

17:07.354 --> 17:09.474
Maybe we can get
a better look at it.

17:24.450 --> 17:26.251
We're back on!

17:34.325 --> 17:36.042
Okay, okay, okay.

17:36.194 --> 17:37.835
I'm gonna try
to blind this-this...

17:37.978 --> 17:39.879
dreaded Dewsaurus
of the deep?

17:40.031 --> 17:42.371
Oh, no. I will find
a name if it kills me!

17:42.514 --> 17:43.936
It probably will.

17:47.957 --> 17:49.071
Huh?

17:59.684 --> 18:02.702
- Mitzy?
- What? What are you talking about?

18:02.862 --> 18:05.897
I know her!
She used to be on my team.

18:06.150 --> 18:08.991
Look at you, Mitz.
You've gotten so big.

18:09.212 --> 18:11.210
It's me, Fethry Duck.

18:11.362 --> 18:13.616
Remember? We split
a ribeye that one time.

18:13.771 --> 18:15.521
It was a bit dry.

18:18.536 --> 18:20.147
- What are you doing? Stop it!
- You stop it!

18:20.289 --> 18:22.673
I'm trying to save us from
that monster you unleashed.

18:22.825 --> 18:24.657
She's not a monster,
she's a Mitzy.

18:24.809 --> 18:28.116
Just because she's a little
different doesn't make her bad!

18:30.748 --> 18:32.624
Wait. Is she...

18:37.936 --> 18:39.142
Huey, help!

18:39.220 --> 18:41.077
Between the toxic jets
and the monster attack,

18:41.220 --> 18:42.655
we're never gonna
make it up in time!

18:42.767 --> 18:45.751
Leave Mitzy alone!
She's trying to help!

18:51.220 --> 18:53.374
Junior Woodchuck

18:53.526 --> 18:56.562

18:56.714 --> 18:59.077

Maybe the hydrothermal
vents did.

You're both nuts!

20:43.970 --> 20:45.915
Write that down in your book. Did you
get it? Did you hear what I said?

20:46.057 --> 20:47.419
Uh, sure.

20:47.506 --> 20:50.609
No, come on, write it.
It's science now.

20:50.761 --> 20:52.374
Thank you, boys.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.093
What will you do
now that the lab's gone?

20:55.275 --> 20:57.553
Well, you thought
I could be a scientist.

20:57.697 --> 21:00.468
Then maybe I should
become one for real!

21:00.933 --> 21:02.896
So do I have to
fill out a form for that,

21:02.974 --> 21:04.051
or do I just buy
a lab coat?

21:04.129 --> 21:05.705
You know what?
I'll figure it out,

21:05.863 --> 21:07.392
'cause that's what
scientists do.

21:07.535 --> 21:09.938
Farewell!
Giddy up, Mitzy!

21:12.598 --> 21:14.525
He is so

21:14.767 --> 21:16.830

21:36.895 --> 21:39.728
Oh, just ran
into an old friend,

21:39.924 --> 21:42.431
snorkeled around,
saw some...

21:42.733 --> 21:43.929
