00:34.274 --> 00:36.837
<i> Our</i>
<i>planet was dying</i>

00:36.906 --> 00:39.845
<i>but we found whatever</i>
<i>happiness we could</i>

00:39.914 --> 00:42.479
<i>with those we loved</i>

00:42.548 --> 00:45.812

00:47.919 --> 00:51.186
<i>I remember my last evening</i>
<i>with my mother and daughter</i>

00:51.254 --> 00:53.892
<i>down by the ocean.</i>

00:53.961 --> 00:56.761
<i>Mom told us a story.</i>

00:56.830 --> 01:02.096
<i>A story about five men in a</i>
<i>tiny boat adrift on the sea.</i>

01:02.165 --> 01:07.372
<i>But with only enough water</i>
<i>and food for three to survive.</i>

01:09.872 --> 01:13.378
<i>How should they decide</i>
<i>who lives and who dies?</i>

01:15.011 --> 01:18.477
<i>I remember her answer, but</i>
<i>I still don't know why</i>

01:18.546 --> 01:20.385
<i>she told us that story.</i>

01:21.818 --> 01:24.889
<i>A few hours later,</i>
<i>they were both gone.</i>

03:24.578 --> 03:25.510
<i> Hibernation</i>
<i>is terminated.</i>

03:30.881 --> 03:34.519
<i>All crew, please proceed</i>
<i>to your quarters.</i>

05:06.479 --> 05:08.481
I'm getting too
old for this shit.

05:10.147 --> 05:11.616
My head.

05:14.483 --> 05:15.521
You okay, Si?

05:54.961 --> 05:57.590
<i> All crew are</i>

<i>Officer Ulph, proceed</i>
<i>to main propulsion</i>

06:02.336 --> 06:04.264
<i>for spent core expulsion.</i>

06:04.333 --> 06:05.164
Hi.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.641
Why don't you get
some rest, Si?

06:08.709 --> 06:11.412
Hibernation's hard,
especially the first time.

06:12.412 --> 06:14.845
You know, if you're struggling,

06:14.914 --> 06:17.649
we can give you something
to settle your nerves.

06:18.617 --> 06:20.652
We all remember
our first flight.

06:23.188 --> 06:23.985
Anyway...

07:10.271 --> 07:12.532
What is it he does again?

07:12.600 --> 07:13.868
He blogs.

07:13.937 --> 07:15.500
Has a massive
following, like massive.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.005
Oh.

07:17.074 --> 07:18.738
He blogs, massive
following, right, useful.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.140
Leave him alone, okay?

07:21.917 --> 07:22.948
Okay?

07:23.017 --> 07:23.748
Okay.

07:26.915 --> 07:29.253
Si, can I get you anything?

07:29.322 --> 07:31.255
No, I'm fine, thank you.

07:31.324 --> 07:32.757
How are the blogs going?

07:33.929 --> 07:34.955
Good.

07:35.024 --> 07:37.864
There's a lot of
interest in the mission.

07:37.933 --> 07:39.193
Cool.

07:39.261 --> 07:41.694
Well let me know if you
need anything, all right?

07:41.763 --> 07:43.466
I will, thank you.

07:48.978 --> 07:50.203
There is it.

Eight months to get here

07:59.918 --> 08:01.287
and we finally see
it with our own eyes.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.450
Have you seen the new data yet?

08:03.519 --> 08:04.618
Yeah.

08:04.687 --> 08:05.790
It's unremarkable.

08:07.930 --> 08:08.793
What?

08:12.931 --> 08:15.063

09:00.875 --> 09:02.081

09:02.150 --> 09:02.983
Complete shit.

09:03.051 --> 09:04.414

There's nothing here, Sen.

09:18.032 --> 09:18.863
No.

09:21.337 --> 09:23.598
So what do we do, Commander?

09:23.667 --> 09:25.634
What we were sent to do.

09:25.703 --> 09:26.568
We investigate the sphere.

09:26.637 --> 09:27.670
This is bullshit!

09:27.739 --> 09:28.803
The ship's scanners are capable

09:28.872 --> 09:30.203
of dissecting entire planets.

09:30.272 --> 09:31.475
How can we not see
through that thing?

<i>engage in sexual activity.</i>

09:42.790 --> 09:44.350

Miz, what is
that light source?

15:39.878 --> 15:41.278
<i>Unknown.</i>

15:41.347 --> 15:43.182
So we're flying blind
and Miz is on vacation.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.418
We've never encountered
anything like this before.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.311
No kidding.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.133
Somebody switched the light on.

16:01.201 --> 16:03.830
Like it's showing us
where it wants us to go.

16:03.899 --> 16:05.235
Exactly.

16:05.304 --> 16:06.666
So what, we just fly
towards that thing

16:06.734 --> 16:09.671
with no clue of what it
is or what just hit us?

16:09.740 --> 16:11.106
Yes.

16:11.175 --> 16:12.806
Okay, systems are restoring.

16:12.875 --> 16:15.708
<i>Onboard data systems</i>

16:19.081 --> 16:20.086

<i>Data source</i>
<i>confirmed as the sphere.</i>

17:18.344 --> 17:20.378
Miz, are these character

17:20.447 --> 17:22.813
<i>The character</i>
<i>sequences are correct.</i>

17:22.882 --> 17:24.547
Why are we set so easy?

17:24.616 --> 17:27.483
Perhaps you will share with
us what you have found.

17:30.459 --> 17:31.516
What?

17:31.585 --> 17:33.390
The transmission is a message.

17:34.596 --> 17:35.425
Saying what?

17:38.361 --> 17:41.534
One word, repeated endlessly.

17:41.603 --> 17:42.498
What word?

17:46.573 --> 17:47.371
"Deus."

17:51.876 --> 17:52.706
"God."

18:13.834 --> 18:15.762
We have to turn back.

18:17.001 --> 18:18.433
Don't you see?

18:18.502 --> 18:20.300
Don't you see
what is happening?

18:20.368 --> 18:21.539
We have to turn back!

18:21.608 --> 18:22.439
Si.

18:24.041 --> 18:25.371
He's not wrong.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.705
We have to speak to Vance

18:26.774 --> 18:28.512
before we go anywhere
near that thing.

18:28.581 --> 18:30.350
We lost connection with
Earth after the first impact.

18:30.418 --> 18:32.881
So we stop the ship until
we get communication back.

18:32.950 --> 18:36.420
Our orders are from Vance, I
see no reason to change them.

18:37.354 --> 18:38.585
This is our first encounter

18:38.654 --> 18:40.326
with an extraterrestrial
intelligence

18:40.394 --> 18:43.427
in the known universe, let
alone, our solar system.

18:44.361 --> 18:45.559
That thing came looking for us.

18:45.627 --> 18:47.200
How do you know
it isn't hostile?

18:47.268 --> 18:48.326
How do you know it's
now what it says it is?

18:48.395 --> 18:49.567
What?

18:49.636 --> 18:50.296
God.

18:51.799 --> 18:53.734
So we're gonna take
its word for it?

18:53.802 --> 18:56.770
No, we follow orders and
investigate the sphere.

18:58.144 --> 19:00.710
We need time to
know more, Sen.

19:00.779 --> 19:02.310
How?

19:02.379 --> 19:04.316
The scanners are blind to it.

19:22.198 --> 19:23.236
Si?

19:32.110 --> 19:33.312
We can't go there.

19:34.475 --> 19:35.710
This is judgment.

19:37.445 --> 19:38.812
Now we pay for our sins.

19:40.948 --> 19:44.455
We don't know what
the sphere is, Si.

19:45.594 --> 19:46.490
I do.

19:50.599 --> 19:51.429
I do.

19:53.394 --> 19:54.630
I hear voices.

19:55.735 --> 19:56.867
Calling.

19:56.935 --> 19:57.864
Screaming.

20:00.401 --> 20:01.439
"Judgment."

20:02.644 --> 20:03.507
Easy.

20:06.779 --> 20:07.610
Si,

20:08.845 --> 20:11.350
we're going to find out
what this sphere is, okay?

20:13.248 --> 20:14.254
Just,

20:15.416 --> 20:16.520
can you tell me,

20:19.355 --> 20:20.722
what voices do you hear?

20:22.523 --> 20:25.293
We can't go near it.

20:25.361 --> 20:27.300
We have to turn back.

20:46.753 --> 20:47.551
Wow.

20:50.188 --> 20:51.555
My mother always said

20:51.623 --> 20:53.557
God was gonna catch
up with me one day.

20:57.525 --> 20:59.057
Big Catholic, my mother.

21:01.267 --> 21:02.566
Always made me go to church.

21:05.469 --> 21:06.932
I don't remember anything about

21:07.001 --> 21:09.573
a big, black ball
in the sky though.

21:10.771 --> 21:13.346
I must've missed that song.

21:17.482 --> 21:20.452
We have to find
out what this is.

21:22.522 --> 21:24.687
We're supposed to be
fearless explorers.

21:26.422 --> 21:27.723
Why would God come now?

21:28.726 --> 21:30.957
Maybe he's had enough
of your bullshit.

21:32.064 --> 21:33.896
Or "she" has.

21:33.965 --> 21:35.234
Ah.

21:35.303 --> 21:37.535
My mother always
said "he" though.

21:38.302 --> 21:39.635
Did she also say that

21:39.704 --> 21:41.605
you always have to
have the last word?

21:46.946 --> 21:51.384
<i> If this sphere is</i>
<i>God, we have nothing to fear.</i>

21:52.850 --> 21:55.619

<i>you've been up to.</i>

21:57.024 --> 21:58.683
God is our judge.

22:05.527 --> 22:07.631
God fucking scares me.

22:11.070 --> 22:11.899
This isn't God.

22:13.601 --> 22:15.408
You don't know that.

22:16.845 --> 22:18.506
He has a point.

22:18.575 --> 22:20.380
You don't know what this is.

22:21.510 --> 22:23.449
But I also have a point,

22:24.549 --> 22:26.518
we have to find
out what this is.

22:28.719 --> 22:30.720
There's a lot of
people watching us.

22:32.926 --> 22:33.756
Yeah?

22:36.226 --> 22:37.056
Yeah.

22:40.232 --> 22:41.566
And if it isn't God,

22:43.567 --> 22:45.504
we can always do something else.

22:47.039 --> 22:48.567
Like what?

22:48.636 --> 22:50.637
Blow the fucker up.

22:50.706 --> 22:53.545
We're not a military vessel.

22:53.614 --> 22:55.877
There's always a way
to blow something up.

22:57.785 --> 22:59.444
Always.

22:59.513 --> 23:02.686
<i>All crew report to</i>
<i>command deck immediately.</i>

23:03.750 --> 23:05.557
Time to go, chaps.

23:28.345 --> 23:29.713
Officer Ulph.

23:36.824 --> 23:37.655
Sir?

23:40.288 --> 23:45.058
That will be the last mention
of blowing anything up.

23:53.408 --> 23:54.606
Okay, flight
trajectory is good.

23:55.639 --> 23:57.202
All good on my screen.

23:58.412 --> 23:59.875
Proceed with
final approach.

24:04.150 --> 24:05.312
<i> Mom!</i>

24:05.381 --> 24:06.611
<i>Mom!</i>

24:10.784 --> 24:12.191
What is it?

24:12.260 --> 24:14.257
It's okay, it's in my head.

24:22.463 --> 24:23.503
Thanks.

24:27.669 --> 24:29.674
So what happened?

24:31.574 --> 24:33.777
I get these headaches.

24:34.711 --> 24:36.780
Is that because
of the accident?

24:38.045 --> 24:40.480
-Yeah.

24:41.518 --> 24:42.522
Sorry to interrupt.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.056
How're you feeling?

24:44.125 --> 24:45.618
I'm good, thanks.

24:45.687 --> 24:47.457
We need to find Si.

24:47.526 --> 24:49.260
He's gone deep into the heel.

24:49.329 --> 24:51.692
Fucking guy's a liability.

24:51.761 --> 24:53.625
What's he doing down there?

24:53.694 --> 24:54.728
I don't know.

24:54.797 --> 24:57.067
I think he's really scared.

24:57.136 --> 24:57.862
Okay.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.267
I'll follow you down.

24:59.336 --> 25:00.133
Sure.

25:03.275 --> 25:04.538
I'll come too.

25:04.607 --> 25:05.603
You need to rest.

25:05.672 --> 25:06.711
Nope.

25:08.345 --> 25:09.675
I'm fine.

25:43.712 --> 25:45.750
Si, can you hear me?

26:02.897 --> 26:05.330
Fuck, this thing is slow.

26:31.999 --> 26:34.931
You said you heard something
before Tez interrupted us.

26:39.106 --> 26:39.903
Did I?

26:40.769 --> 26:41.839
I don't remember.

26:55.715 --> 26:56.755
Si?

27:12.803 --> 27:14.373
Split up, cover more ground.

27:14.442 --> 27:16.071
You take three, I'll take four.

27:17.243 --> 27:18.541
Sure.

27:42.467 --> 27:43.666
Where are you?

27:43.735 --> 27:45.698
Moving through three.

27:45.766 --> 27:46.667
Anything?

27:46.736 --> 27:48.433
Nothing yet.

28:17.964 --> 28:19.834
It's okay.

28:19.903 --> 28:22.137
We all need to be cleansed.

28:25.907 --> 28:27.772
Did you hear that?

28:27.841 --> 28:28.907
Yeah.

28:28.976 --> 28:30.013
Sounded like Tez.

28:31.082 --> 28:33.385
Sounded like it came
from the lower hold.

28:33.454 --> 28:35.018
Okay, I'll meet you there.

28:51.570 --> 28:52.937
I think I'm close.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.104
Where?

28:56.037 --> 28:57.936
I'm in the lower hold now.

28:58.005 --> 28:59.042
I'm a minute away.

28:59.940 --> 29:01.044
Wait for me.

29:18.661 --> 29:19.491
Karla!

29:24.502 --> 29:25.765
Karla!

29:25.834 --> 29:26.867
Where are you?

29:33.214 --> 29:34.279
Karla?

29:37.714 --> 29:39.010
Stop!

29:41.050 --> 29:43.286
Stay the fuck away from me!

29:43.354 --> 29:46.089
Take one fucking step and
I'm gonna cut her throat!

29:46.887 --> 29:48.124
Easy, son.

29:49.694 --> 29:51.496
No one's gonna hurt you.

29:51.564 --> 29:53.223
We just need to talk.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.065
We are beyond redemption.

29:56.935 --> 29:59.102
Nothing can save
us from His wrath.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.040
If we land on that sphere,

30:03.941 --> 30:06.072
we're lambs to the slaughter.

30:06.141 --> 30:08.380
We have to turn the ship around.

30:08.449 --> 30:09.782
Si, Si, Si, Si, Si.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.847
Let's go and talk
to the commander,

30:11.916 --> 30:13.318
we can turn this ship around.

30:13.387 --> 30:14.546
Right, Sen?

30:14.614 --> 30:18.317
-Don't fucking patronize me!

30:18.386 --> 30:20.519
We have to take
charge of the ship.

30:21.722 --> 30:24.395
We have to kill that
fucker, he knows something.

30:24.463 --> 30:25.260
Okay, so,

30:26.832 --> 30:29.132
let's ask him what he knows,

30:30.304 --> 30:31.666
together.

30:31.735 --> 30:32.997
You're lying.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.104
Easy, Si.

30:37.674 --> 30:39.039
It's okay.

30:39.108 --> 30:41.111
It's over, you're safe now.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.709
Officer Ulph,

30:43.778 --> 30:46.714
you're gonna need a body bag
to get Rubbin to the hold.

30:46.783 --> 30:47.579
Where's Tez?

30:49.050 --> 30:50.153
She's in the hold.

30:52.218 --> 30:53.222
I think she's dead.

30:54.522 --> 30:57.094
That's two body bags
we're gonna need.

30:57.162 --> 31:00.091
This shouldn't have
been allowed to happen.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.198
Officer Grey, follow me.

31:40.270 --> 31:44.071
The sphere, Sen,
you know something.

31:44.140 --> 31:46.007
If we knew what the sphere was,

31:46.076 --> 31:48.145
Vance would've told you himself.

31:48.213 --> 31:51.148
He wouldn't keep it away
from you, of all people.

31:51.216 --> 31:53.617
We can't explain how it
appeared or its origin.

31:53.686 --> 31:56.716
Only what it says it is.

31:56.785 --> 31:58.322
God.

31:58.391 --> 31:59.084
Yes.

31:59.153 --> 32:00.052
I don't believe in God.

32:00.121 --> 32:01.788
You are an explorer,

32:01.857 --> 32:03.424
you have been journeyed into
the unknown all of your life,

32:03.492 --> 32:06.861
but this mystery has
got you running scared.

32:06.930 --> 32:08.196
I am not running.

32:08.265 --> 32:11.300
That's exactly
what you are doing.

32:12.933 --> 32:16.239
That's the last thing that
Vance would expect you to do.

32:18.205 --> 32:20.371
People are trusting you,

32:20.440 --> 32:22.377
as are billions back on Earth.

33:03.085 --> 33:04.584
This is your time.

33:06.857 --> 33:07.624
Embrace it.

33:07.692 --> 33:09.261
I'm sorry,

33:09.329 --> 33:11.262
before you launch into
another one of your speeches,

33:11.331 --> 33:14.358
I'm sure millions of
people will enjoy watching,

33:14.427 --> 33:16.762
could we just take second

33:16.830 --> 33:20.303
to take in what has
happened on this mission?

33:21.438 --> 33:23.234
The whole world is
watching, Karla Grey.

33:23.303 --> 33:25.144
I don't give a fuck!

33:25.212 --> 33:27.878
So we're just gonna ignore
what happened with Tez.

33:27.947 --> 33:29.178
Si, who should have never been

33:29.247 --> 33:30.711
on board this ship
to begin with.

33:31.447 --> 33:34.216
Tell Vance that
you are too afraid.

33:34.285 --> 33:35.681
I'm sure he'll tell
the rest of us,

33:35.750 --> 33:38.885
once Miz reestablishes
contact with Earth.

33:38.954 --> 33:40.491
Great.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.324
Hmmm.

33:46.259 --> 33:47.297
You coming?

33:49.397 --> 33:51.737
I'm gonna give myself permission

33:51.806 --> 33:53.336
to go and clean up for a bit

33:54.371 --> 33:56.333
and then go and
say goodbye to Tez.

33:56.402 --> 33:57.670
You can't help her now.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.838
Holy fuck.

34:02.309 --> 34:04.149
Don't take too long.

34:22.895 --> 34:25.467
Time for us
all to meet our maker.

34:27.302 --> 34:29.499
Time for answers.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.440
We owe her that, don't we?

34:36.715 --> 34:40.617
Yeah.

34:40.686 --> 34:41.516
Yeah.

35:00.836 --> 35:04.304
<i>Flying time to</i>
<i>sphere, three hours,</i>

35:04.373 --> 35:07.041
<i>17 minutes and 13 seconds.</i>

35:19.025 --> 35:20.588
Ready to disengage Achilles.

35:22.023 --> 35:22.854
Proceed.

36:23.723 --> 36:24.553
Wait.

36:30.591 --> 36:32.356
There's something down there.

36:32.425 --> 36:33.694
A structure.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.397
What is it?

37:16.873 --> 37:20.637
<i>Communication</i>
<i>with Earth is restored.</i>

37:20.706 --> 37:22.578
<i>CEO Vance is online.</i>

37:27.314 --> 37:28.849
Sir.

37:28.918 --> 37:30.520
<i>Here, we arrive at an</i>
<i>extraordinary moment</i>

37:30.589 --> 37:34.590
<i>in our history. A moment</i>
<i>like no other.</i>

37:37.063 --> 37:39.828
<i>Officers Grey and Ulph,</i>

37:39.897 --> 37:42.829
<i>you carry with you the</i>
<i>blessings and good wishes</i>

37:42.897 --> 37:45.900
<i>of all the peoples</i>
<i>of the earth,</i>

37:45.968 --> 37:48.373
<i>as do the entire crew</i>
<i>of the brave Achilles.</i>

37:48.441 --> 37:50.401
Sir, we have new data
from the surface.

37:50.470 --> 37:52.576
<i>I'm aware.</i>

37:52.645 --> 37:54.105
<i>You should know that</i>
<i>some of the structures</i>

37:54.173 --> 37:56.315
<i>have now appeared</i>
<i>all over the earth.</i>

37:57.685 --> 37:58.482
What?

37:59.249 --> 38:01.452
How many on Earth?

38:01.521 --> 38:03.586
<i>In excess</i>
<i>of ten thousand.</i>

38:04.724 --> 38:05.588
Oh.

38:06.553 --> 38:08.389
It's an invasion.

38:08.458 --> 38:10.857
What are my peers saying, sir?

38:12.532 --> 38:15.598
Members of the scientific
community on Earth,

38:15.666 --> 38:17.369
what are they saying
about those structures?

38:17.438 --> 38:19.796
We're just four people
up here, going in blind.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.266
What the fuck are they saying?

38:21.335 --> 38:22.374
<i>Nothing.</i>

38:23.940 --> 38:26.571
<i>The origin and purpose</i>
<i>of these structures</i>

38:26.639 --> 38:28.139
<i>remains a mystery.</i>

38:29.109 --> 38:31.943
They still have to be
considered a threat.

38:32.012 --> 38:33.911
<i>We have concluded</i>
<i>that the sphere</i>

38:33.980 --> 38:35.981
<i>is at the center</i>
<i>of this mystery.</i>

38:37.420 --> 38:38.984
<i>It must be investigated.</i>

38:40.791 --> 38:43.428
<i>And you must lead</i>
<i>this investigation.</i>

38:45.994 --> 38:48.631
We have to find out
what the fuck this is.

38:49.802 --> 38:50.634
Agreed.

38:51.904 --> 38:56.441
Officer Ulph and Grey, I need
you to proceed to the airlock.

38:59.111 --> 39:01.473
We have to go out there.

39:01.542 --> 39:02.473
I'm going with you.

39:02.542 --> 39:03.914
No, you're not.

39:03.983 --> 39:04.812
Yeah, I am.

39:05.980 --> 39:08.413
I'm the only other
scientist on board.

39:08.482 --> 39:09.520
He's right.

39:10.618 --> 39:11.852
And I want him out there.

39:13.659 --> 39:16.120
We need as many eyes on
this thing as we can get.

39:42.922 --> 39:43.752
We ready?

39:45.156 --> 39:46.689
Getting there.

39:56.267 --> 39:57.700
You're good, all set?

39:59.169 --> 39:59.999
Let's go.

40:04.677 --> 40:06.409
<i>Airlock</i>
<i>compression is complete.</i>

40:06.477 --> 40:08.579
<i>Crew are cleared to proceed.</i>

40:29.634 --> 40:32.765
The inner airlock
door is secured.

40:32.833 --> 40:35.474
<i>Decompression is initiated.</i>

40:39.643 --> 40:42.206
<i>Outer airlock doors are open.</i>

40:43.643 --> 40:44.780
Come.

40:46.220 --> 40:48.047
<i>Crew are clear to proceed.</i>

41:10.071 --> 41:12.737
<i>Outer airlock</i>
<i>doors are secured.</i>

41:52.011 --> 41:53.717
Are you getting anything?

41:54.780 --> 41:55.818
Not a thing.

42:14.006 --> 42:14.837
Well...

42:16.802 --> 42:18.335
my guess is,

42:19.512 --> 42:21.811
this is not on the
Periodic Table.

42:27.453 --> 42:32.657
What about the structure?

42:50.309 --> 42:51.808
Looks like a gate to me.

42:57.546 --> 42:58.716
Oh, come on.

43:03.782 --> 43:04.887
What now?

43:06.655 --> 43:08.385
"What now," indeed.

43:12.925 --> 43:14.897
I hope Si was wrong.

43:16.570 --> 43:19.035
'Cause we're at
the mercy out here.

43:19.104 --> 43:19.935
Huh?

43:23.869 --> 43:24.907
Let's move on.

44:07.714 --> 44:09.285
Look.

44:09.354 --> 44:10.447
Up at the top.

44:17.825 --> 44:19.823
We know that symbol.

44:19.892 --> 44:21.359
What is that?

44:22.467 --> 44:24.131
The Event Horizon.

44:25.965 --> 44:27.970
What does that mean?

44:28.869 --> 44:30.973
The edge of existence.

44:40.448 --> 44:43.722
These gates appear to be
made of the same material...

44:44.983 --> 44:45.988
as the sphere.

44:46.821 --> 44:47.990
If that is a gate,

44:49.593 --> 44:50.795
where does it lead?

45:03.506 --> 45:04.402
What the?

45:06.043 --> 45:10.144
And how are we hearing
that in a vacuum?

45:10.212 --> 45:11.975
Miz is receiving
this transmission

45:12.044 --> 45:13.884
and relaying it to you.

45:14.854 --> 45:17.019
But it's a different
word to the last.

45:21.590 --> 45:22.794
What word?

45:24.297 --> 45:25.797
<i>"Welcome."</i>

45:42.612 --> 45:44.041
Miz?

45:44.110 --> 45:46.015
Miz is translating.

45:46.716 --> 45:48.385
This is incredible.

45:48.454 --> 45:50.052
Miz, translation?

45:52.151 --> 45:53.792
<i>"You have come."</i>

45:55.427 --> 45:56.355
Speak to it.

45:58.430 --> 45:59.226
Say something.

46:00.897 --> 46:03.065
<i>"I speak for the Creator."</i>

46:06.032 --> 46:07.869
Who is the Creator?

46:07.938 --> 46:10.007
<i>"The beginning and end.</i>

46:10.075 --> 46:14.307
<i>"The alpha and omega</i>
<i>of all existence."</i>

46:16.649 --> 46:19.576
And why has the Creator come?

46:19.645 --> 46:22.579
<i>"As a warning</i>
<i>and to help."</i>

46:23.520 --> 46:24.482
Help, how?

46:25.517 --> 46:28.486
<i>"Humankind</i>
<i>faces a choice."</i>

46:29.824 --> 46:31.292
What choice?

46:31.360 --> 46:33.790
<i>"Those who enter</i>
<i>the gates like this one</i>

46:33.859 --> 46:37.996
<i>"will return to the</i>
<i>Creator in eternal peace.</i>

46:38.065 --> 46:40.064
<i>"You must show the way."</i>

46:40.132 --> 46:41.936
Who must show the way?

46:42.004 --> 46:44.603
<i>"You are the one sent.</i>

46:44.672 --> 46:49.080
<i>"It is you who will see</i>
<i>the truth beyond the gate</i>

46:49.148 --> 46:54.116
<i>"and you will return to share</i>
<i>the truth with all humankind."</i>

46:57.120 --> 47:00.419
Karla, you have
clearance to proceed.

47:03.122 --> 47:05.127
What is beyond the gate?

47:06.028 --> 47:08.257
<i>"The end of all suffering.</i>

47:08.326 --> 47:10.462
<i>"The end of all pain."</i>

47:13.465 --> 47:17.403
You said humankind
faced a choice.

47:19.677 --> 47:22.079
What is the alternative?

47:22.148 --> 47:24.811
<i>"Those who do not</i>
<i>choose to enter the gate</i>

47:24.880 --> 47:28.550
<i>"will perish."</i>

47:28.619 --> 47:30.253
Perish, how?

47:30.322 --> 47:34.021
<i>"The sphere also</i>
<i>carries the Event Horizon.</i>

47:34.090 --> 47:36.126
<i>"As the sphere reaches Earth,</i>

47:36.195 --> 47:38.188
<i>"it will being the</i>
<i>most destructive force</i>

47:38.257 --> 47:40.261
<i>"in the entire universe.</i>

47:42.234 --> 47:46.163
<i>"In an instant, Earth</i>
<i>and all those left on it</i>

47:46.232 --> 47:48.504
<i>"will cease to exist."</i>

47:48.573 --> 47:50.471
A black hole.

47:50.539 --> 47:53.070
<i>"Only those who</i>
<i>pass through the gates</i>

47:53.138 --> 47:54.539
<i>"will be saved.</i>

47:55.715 --> 47:58.346
<i>"Only they will find salvation.</i>

47:58.415 --> 48:02.520
<i>"Only they will find the</i>
<i>ones they have lost."</i>

48:05.654 --> 48:06.485
Mom?

48:09.721 --> 48:13.932
Another waits for
you beyond the gate.

49:22.732 --> 49:23.562
Jess?

49:34.777 --> 49:35.607
Baby!

50:15.749 --> 50:19.283
<i>Current heart</i>
<i>rate tachycardia,</i>

50:19.352 --> 50:21.323
<i>152 beats per minute.</i>

50:22.955 --> 50:29.232
<i>-Blood pressure, 143 over 94.</i>

50:29.301 --> 50:32.997
<i>-Respiratory rate, 28.</i>

50:33.066 --> 50:34.130
Easy.

50:34.199 --> 50:35.668
Easy.

50:35.736 --> 50:37.507
<i>No physical</i>
<i>trauma is detected.</i>

50:37.576 --> 50:38.168
Karla?

50:41.075 --> 50:42.545
You're okay.

50:42.614 --> 50:43.411
What?

50:50.349 --> 50:51.617
How'd I get back here?

50:52.858 --> 50:54.554
You came out of the gate.

50:56.289 --> 50:57.590
You could barely stand.

50:58.923 --> 51:02.727
-I helped you back to the ship.

51:03.835 --> 51:05.631
And what about Sean?

51:08.334 --> 51:10.539
He didn't make it.

51:10.608 --> 51:11.872
Mm-mmm.

51:11.941 --> 51:13.104
No, what, no.

51:13.173 --> 51:14.037
No, no, no, no.

51:14.106 --> 51:15.373
No.

51:15.442 --> 51:17.542
Oh my god, what is going on?

51:17.610 --> 51:20.382
We're all asking
the same question.

51:20.450 --> 51:22.852
-Where is Vance?

51:22.920 --> 51:23.880
<i>I'm here.</i>

51:26.288 --> 51:27.819
I need to speak to you.

51:27.888 --> 51:31.493
<i>We need to know what</i>
<i>was beyond the gate.</i>

51:31.561 --> 51:34.532
<i>The whole world is</i>
<i>waiting on your answer.</i>

51:43.942 --> 51:45.671
I saw a golden landscape.

51:48.681 --> 51:50.214
A beautiful...

51:51.883 --> 51:53.184
golden landscape.

51:55.348 --> 51:57.188
And off in the distance,

51:57.955 --> 51:59.421
there was a city with

52:01.188 --> 52:03.260
domes and towers

52:04.028 --> 52:05.724
glinting in the sunlight.

52:08.261 --> 52:09.299
Like a bloody

52:11.165 --> 52:12.434
new Jerusalem.

52:13.869 --> 52:14.700
Like...

52:15.904 --> 52:16.735
Heaven.

52:20.672 --> 52:22.444
<i>What happened next?</i>

52:26.313 --> 52:28.279
I ran toward the city.

52:31.691 --> 52:32.454
And then...

52:45.066 --> 52:45.896
Um...

52:48.874 --> 52:50.341
Then I was back here.

52:50.409 --> 52:52.976
<i>I heard you whisper</i>
<i>your mother's name</i>

52:53.045 --> 52:54.676
before you entered the gate.

52:54.745 --> 52:55.543
Ugh.

52:56.715 --> 53:01.012
Um...

53:01.081 --> 53:01.879
I...

53:03.823 --> 53:05.256
I don't remember.

53:05.923 --> 53:06.752
Easy.

53:10.959 --> 53:11.790
No.

53:13.525 --> 53:15.563
There was no one else.

53:16.430 --> 53:17.966
<i>Try to remember.</i>

53:18.035 --> 53:19.468
There was nothing else.

53:20.772 --> 53:21.503
Okay?

53:23.502 --> 53:25.072
<i>You need to rest.</i>

53:43.060 --> 53:45.093
What happened to Sean?

53:46.998 --> 53:49.531
His suit ruptured.

53:50.696 --> 53:52.835
There was nothing we could do.

53:52.903 --> 53:53.865
Ruptured?

53:55.470 --> 53:57.770
Explorer suits don't rupture.

54:01.412 --> 54:04.975
His glove wasn't
secured properly.

54:08.480 --> 54:09.815
He decompressed.

54:10.782 --> 54:13.120
There was nothing we could do.

54:14.827 --> 54:15.656
It was quick.

54:18.458 --> 54:20.023
I wanted him out there.

54:21.630 --> 54:23.560
Sean was an
experienced explorer.

54:23.629 --> 54:25.567
He knew how to fit a suit.

54:26.532 --> 54:27.569
He made a mistake.

54:30.574 --> 54:33.311
He was in too much of a
rush to get out there.

54:35.841 --> 54:38.712
Vance is right,
you need to rest.

54:41.453 --> 54:43.921
I have to get back
down to the sphere.

54:45.089 --> 54:46.953
We need more answers.

54:47.022 --> 54:47.890
Well...

54:47.958 --> 54:48.788
You can't.

54:49.858 --> 54:52.427
We're already prepping
to leave orbit, so...

54:52.495 --> 54:55.162
Why would we leave
without answers?

54:55.231 --> 54:56.565
You do need to rest.

54:58.703 --> 55:01.405
You'd be more comfortable
in your own quarters.

55:05.041 --> 55:06.503
Come.

55:20.256 --> 55:21.524
I'm good from here.

55:22.255 --> 55:23.086
Thanks.

55:26.063 --> 55:26.958
No cameras here.

55:36.069 --> 55:38.640
Why do they think that
you held something back?

55:45.418 --> 55:47.517
I don't know what
to trust anymore.

56:02.429 --> 56:03.467
I saw something.

56:12.845 --> 56:13.675
What?

56:20.679 --> 56:22.684
You know I lost them,

56:23.548 --> 56:24.686
my family.

56:26.991 --> 56:27.821
Yeah.

56:31.460 --> 56:33.561
I was in a coma for weeks,

56:33.630 --> 56:36.061
head injuries, four
surgeries later,

56:36.130 --> 56:39.030
I walked out of the hospital
but they didn't make it.

56:45.208 --> 56:46.037
I saw them,

56:49.608 --> 56:50.811
at the gate.

56:53.448 --> 56:54.716
He knows what I saw.

56:56.650 --> 56:57.882
I could see it in his eyes

56:57.951 --> 56:59.556
and I could hear
it in his questions

56:59.625 --> 57:01.723
and he wanted me to
say it for the camera.

57:03.188 --> 57:06.530
He knows something
about what this is.

57:11.204 --> 57:13.504
So why isn't he telling us?

57:30.549 --> 57:33.617
<i>Achilles will disengage</i>
<i>from the sphere's orbit</i>

57:33.686 --> 57:35.526
<i>in 30 minutes.</i>

57:53.243 --> 57:54.072
How is she?

57:56.608 --> 57:57.746
Exhausted.

57:58.712 --> 58:00.683
Did she say anything else?

58:02.921 --> 58:03.752
No.

58:13.429 --> 58:14.796
You went out of view.

58:15.761 --> 58:17.832
She didn't say anything.

58:22.537 --> 58:24.806
Prepare to leave orbit.

58:27.608 --> 58:29.739
Confirmed.

58:45.391 --> 58:48.566
We need her to tell us
everything about what she saw.

58:49.564 --> 58:50.832
She's holding back.

58:51.698 --> 58:53.296
You heard what I heard.

58:53.365 --> 58:55.837
You're getting way to
close to this woman.

58:56.974 --> 58:59.841
Remember your orders,
why you are on this ship.

59:01.642 --> 59:03.046
I'm crystal clear.

59:03.114 --> 59:04.648
Remain so.

59:14.553 --> 59:19.025
<i>Crew will assemble</i>
<i>in hibernation in one hour.</i>

1:00:03.535 --> 1:00:06.908
It appears Officer Grey has
broken into my quarters.

1:00:59.465 --> 1:01:01.125
What the fuck are you doing?

1:01:01.194 --> 1:01:03.228
What I told you I
was going to do.

1:01:04.466 --> 1:01:05.263
Question.

1:01:06.233 --> 1:01:09.069
And I got some great
answers about you.

1:01:09.970 --> 1:01:11.937
Eight years Special Air Corps,

1:01:12.005 --> 1:01:14.572
four years with
the Elite Corps,

1:01:14.641 --> 1:01:18.342
decorated more times than you
can probably even remember.

1:01:19.545 --> 1:01:23.479
You weren't just good,
you were one of the best.

1:01:24.917 --> 1:01:26.687
It was a different life.

1:01:26.756 --> 1:01:27.989
What're you doing on this ship?

1:01:30.221 --> 1:01:31.993
I was told to keep the peace.

1:01:32.792 --> 1:01:34.059
That was it.

1:01:34.128 --> 1:01:36.428
What do you know
about the sphere?

1:01:36.497 --> 1:01:37.328
Nothing.

1:01:38.469 --> 1:01:40.733
You know more than I do.

1:01:40.802 --> 1:01:42.102
You went through the gate.

1:01:43.001 --> 1:01:44.269
I don't believe you.

1:01:45.910 --> 1:01:48.904
There's nothing I
can do about that.

1:01:48.973 --> 1:01:50.011
Okay, move.

1:01:51.515 --> 1:01:53.116
Where are we going?

1:01:53.185 --> 1:01:53.943
Move.

1:02:14.537 --> 1:02:15.969
This is mutiny.

1:02:16.038 --> 1:02:19.003
That's a death
sentence back on Earth.

1:02:19.072 --> 1:02:22.044
Well, apparently, the sphere

1:02:22.113 --> 1:02:25.310
is the death sentence
for an entire planet, so,

1:02:26.814 --> 1:02:28.451
it's time for the truth.

1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.587
Well you already have it.

1:02:30.655 --> 1:02:31.949
You saw what was
beyond the gate.

1:02:32.018 --> 1:02:34.484
Okay, I'll start, shall I?

1:02:36.227 --> 1:02:37.058
Sean...

1:02:39.958 --> 1:02:41.260
was murdered.

1:02:42.496 --> 1:02:45.829
Oh yeah, I saw the suit,
there's nothing wrong with it.

1:02:45.898 --> 1:02:46.936
He was shot.

1:02:48.268 --> 1:02:51.039
-You killed him.

1:02:53.972 --> 1:02:54.977
You're a hitman.

1:02:56.010 --> 1:02:58.310
Hired to clean up any problems.

1:03:00.284 --> 1:03:01.082
But why?

1:03:02.949 --> 1:03:04.651
I want the truth.

1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:06.220
They all want the truth,

1:03:06.289 --> 1:03:08.221
I'm pretty sure you'll
cut this part out though.

1:03:09.191 --> 1:03:11.058
Tell them what you
saw beyond the gate.

1:03:11.127 --> 1:03:14.095
You know what I saw
and so does Vance.

1:03:16.531 --> 1:03:17.329
How?

1:03:24.504 --> 1:03:27.009
<i>We believe that what</i>
<i>you saw was real.</i>

1:03:28.779 --> 1:03:30.111
<i>That you glimpsed Heaven.</i>

1:03:30.845 --> 1:03:32.548
That was not Heaven.

1:03:32.616 --> 1:03:34.183
<i>Then what was it?</i>

1:03:34.251 --> 1:03:37.118
<i>Even a scientist must</i>
<i>believe her own eyes.</i>

1:03:38.249 --> 1:03:39.989
<i>We're not your enemies.</i>

1:03:43.161 --> 1:03:45.788
Your enforcer will kill me
the first chance he gets.

1:03:45.857 --> 1:03:49.161
<i>Why would I seek</i>
<i>to harm you, of all people?</i>

1:03:49.230 --> 1:03:51.495
-You stay away from me!

1:03:52.934 --> 1:03:54.237
<i>This cannot be stopped.</i>

1:03:54.306 --> 1:03:56.801
<i>Besides,</i>

1:03:56.869 --> 1:03:58.802
<i>people have already started</i>
<i>to make their own choice.</i>

1:03:58.871 --> 1:04:01.676
<i>...Have</i>
<i>appeared all over the world.</i>

1:04:01.744 --> 1:04:03.277
<i>It is estimated--</i>

1:04:03.346 --> 1:04:04.976
<i>The earth has become</i>
<i>a living hell.</i>

1:04:05.045 --> 1:04:06.312
<i>People want to escape.</i>

1:04:07.146 --> 1:04:08.545
<i>Escape to paradise.</i>

1:04:09.546 --> 1:04:11.850
-Holy shit.

1:04:11.919 --> 1:04:13.719
This has to be stopped.

1:04:22.796 --> 1:04:24.500
You won't.

1:04:37.976 --> 1:04:39.180
Am I next?

1:04:41.148 --> 1:04:42.145
What are you doing?

1:04:42.214 --> 1:04:44.483
<i>I'm not doing anything, Karla.</i>

1:04:44.551 --> 1:04:46.682
<i>Not even I can stop</i>
<i>what's happening.</i>

1:04:50.462 --> 1:04:51.192
You need help.

1:04:52.329 --> 1:04:55.232
And then I'll take this
ship anywhere you wanna go.

1:04:55.301 --> 1:04:56.197
Sure.

1:04:57.635 --> 1:04:59.468
Why would you do that?

1:04:59.537 --> 1:05:01.337
You killed Sean.

1:05:01.406 --> 1:05:02.239
Yeah.

1:05:02.308 --> 1:05:03.204
Yeah.

1:05:04.409 --> 1:05:05.173
And now...

1:05:06.909 --> 1:05:08.343
Now you're gonna kill me.

1:05:08.412 --> 1:05:09.210
No.

1:05:11.115 --> 1:05:13.214
You're not the only one
who wants the truth.

1:05:14.445 --> 1:05:16.019
When I stepped on this ship,

1:05:16.087 --> 1:05:17.988
I had no idea where
all this was going.

1:05:18.790 --> 1:05:20.452
I don't know what the sphere is.

1:05:24.462 --> 1:05:25.292
Okay.

1:05:39.203 --> 1:05:41.236
You were lucky.

1:05:41.305 --> 1:05:42.243
Just a flesh wound.

1:05:43.415 --> 1:05:44.380
Yeah.

1:05:44.449 --> 1:05:45.279
Lucky.

1:05:50.184 --> 1:05:52.253
I wanna go back to the sphere.

1:05:53.253 --> 1:05:56.158
But Vance has control of Miz.

1:05:58.863 --> 1:06:03.264
I have the code to override her.

1:06:05.903 --> 1:06:07.466
We would have to lose the heel.

1:06:08.666 --> 1:06:10.568
She's too big to
control manually.

1:06:11.673 --> 1:06:12.504
So,

1:06:14.009 --> 1:06:15.573
we'd lose main propulsion

1:06:18.142 --> 1:06:19.181
and...

1:06:20.377 --> 1:06:22.415
our way back to Earth.

1:06:24.088 --> 1:06:28.289
Achilles propulsion
should make it

1:06:30.928 --> 1:06:32.425
but it would take a long time.

1:06:33.597 --> 1:06:34.156
How long?

1:06:34.225 --> 1:06:36.132
Five, six years.

1:06:38.129 --> 1:06:39.700
More,

1:06:39.769 --> 1:06:41.368
I'm guessing.

1:06:41.437 --> 1:06:44.272
We're not going to get
to go home, are we?

1:06:46.073 --> 1:06:48.276
It's not looking good.

1:06:53.250 --> 1:06:56.317
There is something
else we could do.

1:07:29.785 --> 1:07:30.582
<i>Karla.</i>

1:07:32.290 --> 1:07:34.952
<i>You intend to return</i>
<i>to the sphere.</i>

1:07:35.021 --> 1:07:35.851
I do.

1:07:36.787 --> 1:07:40.496
Or destroy it if
you try to stop me.

1:07:40.565 --> 1:07:41.558
<i>Why?</i>

1:07:41.626 --> 1:07:43.364
Because this whole
thing is a lie.

1:07:45.396 --> 1:07:47.700
What are you doing?

1:07:47.769 --> 1:07:50.334
<i>I gave the world a scientist</i>
<i>who would discover God.</i>

1:07:50.403 --> 1:07:53.171
Cut the bullshit, what is this?

1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.274
You did not discover God.

1:07:55.343 --> 1:07:57.510
<i>But you could now become God.</i>

1:07:58.409 --> 1:08:00.244
And what does that mean?

1:08:00.312 --> 1:08:01.547
<i>Go to your screen.</i>

1:08:04.589 --> 1:08:05.386
Okie-doke.

1:08:09.224 --> 1:08:10.388
<i>Achilles files classified.</i>

1:08:10.456 --> 1:08:13.760
<i>Sphere schematics accessed.</i>

1:08:13.829 --> 1:08:19.268
<i>A self replicating</i>
<i>material called Bio-Mech 34987,</i>

1:08:19.336 --> 1:08:21.832
<i>capable of building</i>
<i>huge structures</i>

1:08:21.900 --> 1:08:24.834
<i>to a preconceived</i>
<i>design very quickly.</i>

1:08:26.477 --> 1:08:29.207
<i>The patent of the</i>
<i>advanced Achilles program</i>

1:08:29.276 --> 1:08:30.510
<i>which I am very proud.</i>

1:08:33.850 --> 1:08:35.816
You built this?

1:08:51.833 --> 1:08:52.664
Why?

1:08:55.067 --> 1:08:58.571
<i>I'll tell you a story about</i>
<i>a once beautiful planet</i>

1:09:00.411 --> 1:09:02.476
<i>that sits at the center</i>
<i>of the Milky Way.</i>

1:09:04.416 --> 1:09:06.178
<i>The planet that was</i>
<i>the jewel in the crown</i>

1:09:06.246 --> 1:09:07.514
of the known universe.

1:09:08.816 --> 1:09:11.518
<i>The planet whose beauty</i>
<i>was beyond comparison</i>

1:09:12.518 --> 1:09:15.488
<i>and then came human beings</i>

1:09:15.557 --> 1:09:17.319
<i>and over tens of</i>
<i>thousands of years</i>

1:09:17.388 --> 1:09:21.364
<i>this planet was brought to</i>
<i>the very point of extinction.</i>

1:09:21.433 --> 1:09:24.961
<i>21 billion people now</i>
<i>cram into the 15 percent</i>

1:09:25.030 --> 1:09:28.833
<i>of the Earth's service</i>
<i>that is still habitable.</i>

1:09:28.901 --> 1:09:32.605
<i>Scientists tell us</i>
<i>that within 30 years</i>

1:09:33.571 --> 1:09:35.245
<i>this planet will die.</i>

1:09:36.013 --> 1:09:38.776
<i>The human race must be culled.</i>

1:09:38.844 --> 1:09:41.581
<i>The many sacrificed</i>
<i>to save the few</i>

1:09:42.788 --> 1:09:43.616
<i>or we all die.</i>

1:09:44.886 --> 1:09:45.717
So,

1:09:47.091 --> 1:09:49.490
people enter the gates on Earth

1:09:51.027 --> 1:09:52.427
and go to their deaths

1:09:54.562 --> 1:09:56.563
but you tell them
that it's God?

1:09:58.032 --> 1:09:58.862
Well?

1:10:00.634 --> 1:10:02.668
You got me to do that
for you for you.

1:10:04.974 --> 1:10:06.243
<i>To save the few.</i>

1:10:07.606 --> 1:10:09.510
How many do you plan to kill?

1:10:11.213 --> 1:10:12.843
<i>In excess of 15 billion,</i>

1:10:14.183 --> 1:10:15.516
<i>saving six billion.</i>

1:10:16.754 --> 1:10:17.947
So this...

1:10:20.859 --> 1:10:22.622
is your final solution?

1:10:26.259 --> 1:10:27.429
How do they die?

1:10:28.664 --> 1:10:32.335
<i>Each gate houses a</i>
<i>contained Event Horizon.</i>

1:10:34.973 --> 1:10:36.405
<i>They step into oblivion.</i>

1:10:37.206 --> 1:10:39.106
<i>It's quite painless.</i>

1:10:39.175 --> 1:10:41.036
<i>Instant non-existence.</i>

1:10:41.104 --> 1:10:44.545
Another Vance Achilles
patent, no doubt.

1:10:49.615 --> 1:10:51.519
The figure at the gate said

1:10:51.587 --> 1:10:53.886
that the sphere would
destroy the earth.

1:10:53.954 --> 1:10:57.922
<i>The sphere has no</i>
<i>destructive capabilities.</i>

1:10:57.991 --> 1:11:00.561
<i>It was conceived to</i>
<i>appear as a threat.</i>

1:11:01.826 --> 1:11:05.031
<i>-As a judgment.</i>

1:11:05.099 --> 1:11:06.530
Well then,

1:11:06.599 --> 1:11:08.104
people would discover the lie.

1:11:08.172 --> 1:11:09.939
<i>Before it reaches the earth,</i>

1:11:10.008 --> 1:11:12.538
<i>the sphere will self-destruct.</i>

1:11:12.607 --> 1:11:14.471
<i>A coordinated</i>
<i>military strike</i>

1:11:14.540 --> 1:11:16.941
<i>credited with its destruction.</i>

1:11:17.010 --> 1:11:20.009
<i>By then, billions</i>
<i>will already be dead.</i>

1:11:20.077 --> 1:11:22.446
<i>The sphere's secret</i>
<i>hidden forever.</i>

1:11:22.514 --> 1:11:23.914
<i>If we do nothing,</i>

1:11:25.056 --> 1:11:26.587
<i>the planet will die.</i>

1:11:27.851 --> 1:11:29.557
<i>There will be no one left.</i>

1:11:33.260 --> 1:11:34.595
How did I see

1:11:37.101 --> 1:11:38.599
what was beyond the gate?

1:11:41.872 --> 1:11:42.603
My mother,

1:11:43.567 --> 1:11:46.541
and then Jess.

1:11:50.111 --> 1:11:51.408
<i>Listen.</i>

1:11:51.476 --> 1:11:53.014
<i>Mom!</i>

1:11:53.082 --> 1:11:54.214
<i>Karla?</i>

1:11:54.283 --> 1:11:55.814
<i>After your accident,</i>

1:11:56.914 --> 1:12:00.589
<i>we placed a chip in your head</i>

1:12:00.657 --> 1:12:03.824
<i>which would be activated</i>
<i>for this mission.</i>

1:12:03.892 --> 1:12:06.226
<i>Through which we could</i>
<i>get you to see or hear</i>

1:12:06.295 --> 1:12:08.028
<i>whatever we wanted.</i>

1:12:15.071 --> 1:12:16.032
And you woke me

1:12:18.571 --> 1:12:20.641
before I could reach her.

1:12:25.078 --> 1:12:29.584
You've been preparing me
for this trip for two years.

1:12:31.122 --> 1:12:33.786
You arranged the accident

1:12:33.854 --> 1:12:36.624
so you could put this
thing in my head.

1:12:38.458 --> 1:12:42.663
You murdered my family

1:12:44.067 --> 1:12:45.600
to save the few?

1:12:48.169 --> 1:12:48.999
<i>Yes.</i>

1:12:50.635 --> 1:12:53.806
Everything you are

1:12:56.045 --> 1:12:56.842
for me...

1:12:59.576 --> 1:13:00.648
is a lie.

1:13:28.045 --> 1:13:29.204
I miss my mum.

1:13:31.676 --> 1:13:32.878
And I wish she was here.

1:13:35.781 --> 1:13:37.779
She would tell you a story.

1:13:37.848 --> 1:13:39.115
<i>What story?</i>

1:13:40.255 --> 1:13:41.150
It's a goodie.

1:13:44.889 --> 1:13:48.223
Five men adrift on the ocean

1:13:49.526 --> 1:13:53.195
with only enough food and
water for three to survive,

1:13:54.303 --> 1:13:55.736
so two have to die.

1:13:57.205 --> 1:13:58.035
<i>Exactly.</i>

1:13:59.672 --> 1:14:01.071
<i>Your mother understood.</i>

1:14:01.947 --> 1:14:03.673
Yeah, well,

1:14:03.742 --> 1:14:05.746
she was a very smart lady.

1:14:10.351 --> 1:14:11.719
But that's not

1:14:12.750 --> 1:14:15.525
how her story ends.

1:14:18.496 --> 1:14:20.662
You see, she
understood something

1:14:23.694 --> 1:14:24.963
that you don't.

1:14:27.804 --> 1:14:31.701
They could find fish or
an island to sustain them

1:14:31.770 --> 1:14:33.235
or even a ship could come.

1:14:34.744 --> 1:14:37.910
No one knows what
the ocean will bring.

1:14:39.447 --> 1:14:40.649
All of us deserve

1:14:41.713 --> 1:14:46.688
to find our own future.

1:14:50.361 --> 1:14:52.859
<i>Is this your final solution?</i>

1:14:55.197 --> 1:14:56.027
You're...

1:14:56.760 --> 1:14:57.798
a fucking...

1:15:00.036 --> 1:15:00.801
monster.

1:15:19.883 --> 1:15:21.591
I armed the core.

1:15:23.922 --> 1:15:25.826
<i>Then you leave me no choice.</i>

1:15:26.558 --> 1:15:27.597
Ulph?

1:15:28.830 --> 1:15:30.059
You need to get
back to the Achilles

1:15:30.128 --> 1:15:31.592
and bring the
core with you now!

1:15:31.661 --> 1:15:32.663
Why?

1:15:32.732 --> 1:15:33.729
What's happening up there?

1:15:33.798 --> 1:15:35.465
Just get back here.

1:15:35.534 --> 1:15:39.939
But I can't detonate the core
remotely from the Achilles.

1:15:40.805 --> 1:15:42.007
I understand that.

1:15:43.212 --> 1:15:44.647
<i>Miz,</i>

1:15:44.716 --> 1:15:47.579
<i>begin the auto</i>
<i>destruct of the ship.</i>

1:15:47.648 --> 1:15:51.218
<i>Sequence code 21397.</i>

1:15:53.024 --> 1:15:55.119
<i>Achilles self-destruct</i>
<i>sequence is initiated.</i>

1:15:56.895 --> 1:16:00.062
<i>Achilles will self-destruct</i>
<i>in three minutes.</i>

1:16:00.130 --> 1:16:01.125
Holy shit.

1:16:02.132 --> 1:16:03.865
Fuck this.

1:16:03.933 --> 1:16:06.133
<i>Ulph will not make</i>
<i>it back in time.</i>

1:16:06.202 --> 1:16:07.637
<i>Besides,</i>

1:16:07.705 --> 1:16:09.669
<i>Miz will prevent</i>
<i>you from disengaging</i>

1:16:09.737 --> 1:16:12.136
<i>the Achilles from the heel.</i>

1:16:12.205 --> 1:16:14.644
<i>I will ask you</i>
<i>this one more time.</i>

1:16:16.011 --> 1:16:18.241
<i>Will you help me in</i>
<i>this great cause?</i>

1:16:20.813 --> 1:16:22.883
No one gets to play Deus.

1:16:27.358 --> 1:16:28.889
<i>Goodbye, Karla Grey.</i>

1:16:29.955 --> 1:16:31.892
<i>My second greatest creation.</i>

1:16:49.047 --> 1:16:54.016
<i>Achilles will</i>
<i>self-destruct in two minutes.</i>

1:16:54.085 --> 1:16:55.249
Ulph,

1:16:55.318 --> 1:16:56.147
where are you?

1:16:56.914 --> 1:16:58.585
I'm near transit.

1:16:58.654 --> 1:17:00.455
You have under two minutes!

1:17:00.524 --> 1:17:02.791
Yeah, I heard that, thanks.

1:17:03.459 --> 1:17:05.159
Hey, listen to me.

1:17:05.228 --> 1:17:08.291
Go to my station and bring up
the ship's docking schematic.

1:17:09.729 --> 1:17:10.760
Can you find that?

1:17:10.829 --> 1:17:12.093
I'm on it!

1:17:12.162 --> 1:17:14.569
Bring up the manual override

1:17:14.637 --> 1:17:16.299
and it will ask
you for a code.

1:17:24.975 --> 1:17:26.877
Move, you fucker.

1:17:26.946 --> 1:17:29.249
I'm in but I don't have a code.

1:17:29.318 --> 1:17:30.687
I do.

1:17:30.755 --> 1:17:31.715
<i>Achilles will</i>
<i>self-destruct...</i>

1:17:31.784 --> 1:17:32.717
-Ready?
-Yes.

1:17:32.785 --> 1:17:33.917
<i>...In one minute.</i>

1:17:33.986 --> 1:17:35.922
Code is, zero, zero, seven,

1:17:35.991 --> 1:17:40.160
six, five, seven,
eight, six, five,

1:17:40.229 --> 1:17:41.326
89,

1:17:41.395 --> 1:17:43.065
73.

1:17:43.134 --> 1:17:45.761
<i>Manual control</i>
<i>of the Achilles is confirmed.</i>

1:17:45.830 --> 1:17:47.432
Okay, we're in.

1:17:47.501 --> 1:17:48.569
Okay.

1:17:48.638 --> 1:17:49.970
We can separate the ship now.

1:17:50.837 --> 1:17:52.170
You need to get back here.

1:17:53.308 --> 1:17:55.307
No shit!

1:17:55.376 --> 1:17:58.748
<i>Achilles will</i>
<i>self-destruct in 30 seconds.</i>

1:18:04.885 --> 1:18:07.882
I'm not gonna make it back.

1:18:07.951 --> 1:18:09.489
You have to go.

1:18:09.558 --> 1:18:10.859
I'm waiting for you.

1:18:13.626 --> 1:18:15.161
You can't.

1:18:15.230 --> 1:18:18.200
<i>Achilles will</i>
<i>self-destruct in ten,</i>

1:18:18.268 --> 1:18:19.102

<i>eight,</i>

1:20:35.606 --> 1:20:37.137

1:20:40.870 --> 1:20:45.113
<i>I have a special</i>

1:20:45.182 --> 1:20:47.877

We have no way of remotely
detonating the core now.

1:21:41.072 --> 1:21:44.941
It has to be done
manually from the surface.

1:21:45.808 --> 1:21:47.207
Then we'll do it together.

1:21:50.844 --> 1:21:52.014
I had no idea...

1:21:55.113 --> 1:21:56.480
what Vance was planning.

1:22:01.324 --> 1:22:05.621
He only put me on board to
take care of any problems.

1:22:09.193 --> 1:22:11.231
I even fucked that up.

1:22:17.205 --> 1:22:20.372
But he didn't bargain
for you, did he?

1:22:25.076 --> 1:22:26.312
None of us did.

1:22:38.426 --> 1:22:40.829

No.

1:23:10.361 --> 1:23:11.192
No.

1:23:12.388 --> 1:23:14.525
You have to get back.

1:23:15.728 --> 1:23:18.661
You have to tell the story
of what happened here.

1:23:20.698 --> 1:23:23.199
Tell them the truth
about the sphere.

1:23:23.267 --> 1:23:25.173
That's more important.

1:23:29.611 --> 1:23:30.442
Please.

1:23:36.115 --> 1:23:38.120
Please, don't do this.

1:23:41.318 --> 1:23:43.059
I'll never make it back.

1:23:44.288 --> 1:23:45.622
