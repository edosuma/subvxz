18:12.122 --> 18:13.323

if they walk free after--

18:13.323 --> 18:15.255

18:15.255 --> 18:18.228
I promise.
They won't.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.318
- Before you get up there, you
gotta be clear about something.

18:28.318 --> 18:30.160
The jury doesn't like you,
Kevin,

18:30.160 --> 18:31.241

change that.

18:31.241 --> 18:33.133

leaving her there

18:33.133 --> 18:34.234

18:34.234 --> 18:36.346
The goal isn't
to get them to like you,

18:36.346 --> 18:38.248
so don't start
defending yourself

18:38.248 --> 18:42.242
like you're some good,
misunderstood kid, okay?

18:42.242 --> 18:44.214
- Yeah, okay.

18:44.214 --> 18:46.256
- Now,

18:46.256 --> 18:49.189
this is important.

18:49.189 --> 18:52.172
Once you get up there
and say it's all him, it's done.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.144
You can't later say that
both of you were in on it.

18:54.144 --> 18:56.276
- Well, I wasn't in on it!

18:56.276 --> 18:58.228
but on conspiracy, you get 20.

18:58.228 --> 18:59.319
Good behavior,

18:59.319 --> 19:02.202

there's no going back.

I can't do that.

about it?

19:15.235 --> 19:16.296

you're suggesting

19:16.296 --> 19:18.168
an innocent person
plead guilty--

19:18.168 --> 19:21.271

Mr. Peete.

19:21.271 --> 19:24.354
Now, he may not have killed her,
but him walking away--

19:29.239 --> 19:31.291
Let's not call him innocent.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.277
- Time off?

19:37.277 --> 19:39.309
- Just a few weeks...

19:39.309 --> 19:40.350
or maybe longer.

19:40.350 --> 19:42.262
- [sighs]
Ellenor--

19:42.262 --> 19:43.363
- What I did, Bobby,
it would have been bad enough

19:43.363 --> 19:45.345
had I thought about it first,

19:45.345 --> 19:48.348

I did it on instinct.

"How can we fool 'em?"

20:01.251 --> 20:03.383
Too bad the guy's

20:03.383 --> 20:05.435
A judgment on wrongful death
is really minimal

20:05.435 --> 20:07.437

so liability wise,

20:07.437 --> 20:10.370

20:20.370 --> 20:23.233
We're becoming more...

20:23.233 --> 20:26.376

remake ourselves.

Not now.

20:37.257 --> 20:38.468

20:45.355 --> 20:47.267
You want to know
what the worst part is?

20:47.267 --> 20:49.349
If you hadn't been the guy
who got hit,

20:49.349 --> 20:53.323
I might be feeling really
proud of myself just about now.

20:59.429 --> 21:02.322
- A case.
My own case.

21:02.322 --> 21:04.284
- Stolen bike.
One day trial.

21:04.284 --> 21:05.435
Couple of weeks from now.
No big deal.

21:05.435 --> 21:07.297

Well, can I do it?

21:07.297 --> 21:08.438
I mean, I haven't been
sworn in yet.

21:08.438 --> 21:10.340
Will they let me?
- Oh, you don't have to be

21:10.340 --> 21:11.471
officially sworn in, Becky.
- Okay.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.473
- It's just a stolen bicycle.
First offense--

21:13.473 --> 21:15.395
- Stolen.
Can they make intent?

21:15.395 --> 21:16.446
I mean, have you talked
to the client yet?

21:16.446 --> 21:18.298
It could have been a mistake.

21:18.298 --> 21:19.359
I mean, did the bike
look like his own?

21:19.359 --> 21:20.450
Or duress.
There could have been

21:20.450 --> 21:22.472
exigent circumstances--
oh, is he a minor?

21:22.472 --> 21:24.434
Wait, we might be able
to make out undue influence.

21:24.434 --> 21:26.336
Oh, have you interviewed
the arresting officers?

21:26.336 --> 21:27.447
- Uh, Becky--
- And then that bike.

21:27.447 --> 21:28.498
I mean, what about that?
I mean, are there any

21:28.498 --> 21:31.381
chain of custody issues?
I mean...

21:31.381 --> 21:34.344
how can we possibly be
ready to go in two weeks?

21:34.344 --> 21:36.426
We have two weeks.

21:37.528 --> 21:39.510
- This could be ugly.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.385
- He just reversed it.

21:45.385 --> 21:47.407
He stayed and I left.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.448
- To go for a walk?

21:48.448 --> 21:50.380
- Yes.

21:50.380 --> 21:53.383

put in danger, Kevin,

21:53.383 --> 21:55.395

21:55.395 --> 21:56.537

21:57.538 --> 22:01.481
KEVIN: Of him a little.

that I left,

22:04.525 --> 22:06.476

22:06.476 --> 22:08.388
I think I just really wanted
to pretend

22:08.388 --> 22:11.361
that nothing bad was
gonna happen,

22:11.361 --> 22:13.524

22:13.524 --> 22:15.526

Kevin.

22:15.526 --> 22:17.477

22:17.477 --> 22:19.560
- You both brought her
back in there, didn't you?

22:19.560 --> 22:21.552

No, he did,

22:21.552 --> 22:23.534
and he killed her.

22:26.517 --> 22:30.490
- The burglary in 1994,
you do it yourself

22:30.490 --> 22:32.472
or was there anybody else
with you?

22:32.472 --> 22:34.515
- Myself.
- You committed the crime

22:34.515 --> 22:36.517

- Objection.

22:36.517 --> 22:38.579
- Overruled.

It's just a little
too convenient,

They both blame each other.

who's telling the truth.

23:07.467 --> 23:09.540

a kid could kill

about to be killed

23:11.481 --> 23:13.614

23:13.614 --> 23:15.586

23:15.586 --> 23:18.408
Walking away, you could have
argued reckless disregard.

23:18.408 --> 23:21.411

and you know it as well as I do.

trying somebody for murder

23:22.613 --> 23:24.494

a good faith belief

23:24.494 --> 23:25.606

gave me this speech.

Are you here as my friend
or as co-counsel?

23:33.463 --> 23:35.556

29:57.908 --> 30:00.941

to try these boys together.

30:00.941 --> 30:03.003
They don't know
which one was where,

30:03.003 --> 30:05.876

on one simple thing:

30:05.876 --> 30:07.898
You would rather
punish them both

30:07.898 --> 30:10.831
than to see whoever did it
go free.

30:10.831 --> 30:12.833
Here's Miss Gamble's thinking:

30:12.833 --> 30:14.915
If these boys
get separate trials,

30:14.915 --> 30:17.848
it's likely both juries
will find reasonable doubt

30:17.848 --> 30:19.820
thinking that
the evidence must be there

30:19.820 --> 30:20.921
on the other guy,

30:20.921 --> 30:23.003
and then you have
two quick acquittals,

30:23.003 --> 30:25.826
but a combined trial,
she's boxed you in.

30:25.826 --> 30:27.828
Evidence is the same
for both defendants.

30:27.828 --> 30:29.019
Either they both go to prison,

30:29.019 --> 30:30.901
or they both go free,

30:30.901 --> 30:32.052
and nobody--

30:32.052 --> 30:35.846
nobody wants
to see them both go free.

30:37.047 --> 30:39.069
Beautiful,

30:41.842 --> 30:43.964

30:43.964 --> 30:46.967
They're argument is:
Somebody's gotta pay,

30:46.967 --> 30:49.920
and the only way to be sure
to get the guilty guy,

30:49.920 --> 30:51.061
is to lock them both up

30:51.061 --> 30:55.005
'cause we don't know
which <i>one</i>

30:55.005 --> 30:56.987
