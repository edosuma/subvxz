WEBVTT

00:11.005 --> 00:14.445
We've got records of dark-web
conversations between the Lambert boy

00:14.525 --> 00:17.485
and militant leftists, The Collective.
We're not discounting

00:17.565 --> 00:19.005
the possibility of another event.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.285
What was the target?
What were you planning to strike?

00:21.365 --> 00:22.685
Why would I kill my own family?

00:23.005 --> 00:26.085
<i>The United States conducted</i>
<i>an aerial strike on a vehicle</i>

00:26.165 --> 00:28.765
<i>in the Pakistani territory</i>
<i>of Northern Waziristan.</i>

00:28.845 --> 00:33.045
-You were targeting a Pakistani general?
-We targeted members of the Haqqani.

00:33.125 --> 00:36.365
<i>I want to come home. Please bring me home.</i>

00:39.285 --> 00:42.085
Someone's covering something up
and I think that Bailey is involved.

00:42.165 --> 00:43.365
And that's why she's dead.

00:43.445 --> 00:47.085
Then why would Catriona Bailey
call you so many times that night?

00:47.165 --> 00:50.125
The house in Adelaide, it was a fuck-up.

00:50.205 --> 00:51.165
I know.

00:55.045 --> 00:59.085
The police are about to identify a suspect
in the murder of Catriona Bailey.

00:59.165 --> 01:00.605
<i>Mina Almasi.</i>

01:00.685 --> 01:04.245
Doesn't she have an association
with your media advisor, Harriet Dunkley?

01:04.325 --> 01:09.165
Robbie didn't do it.
The bomb... came from the sky.

01:16.485 --> 01:19.605
<i>Bird in flight.</i>
<i>Disarm. Disarm.</i>

01:21.285 --> 01:25.405
<i>I can't. It's not responding.</i>
<i>Impact in six seconds, sir.</i>

01:25.485 --> 01:28.285
<i>Weapon still hot.</i>
<i>Disarm. Disarm.</i>

01:28.365 --> 01:29.485
<i>Disarm, Treloar!</i>

01:29.565 --> 01:32.285
<i>Too late. Impact. Impact!</i>

01:52.165 --> 01:53.485
You need to call your dad.

01:55.685 --> 01:56.605
What do I say?

01:57.965 --> 01:59.205
Tell him you're in Hawaii.

02:01.845 --> 02:04.525
-Hawaii?
-A last-minute thing.

02:06.125 --> 02:06.965
Here.

02:15.565 --> 02:16.765
What's gonna happen to me?
Dial the phone, Treloar.

02:34.605 --> 02:36.405
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

02:37.565 --> 02:40.965
<i>You've called Ray Treloar.</i>
<i>I can't come to the phone right now,</i>

02:41.045 --> 02:42.485
<i>so please leave a message.</i>

02:43.565 --> 02:45.485
Dad, it's me.

02:47.725 --> 02:50.445
I'm... calling from Hawaii.

02:51.685 --> 02:55.245
Sorry I missed you.
I was hoping to hear your voice.

02:58.005 --> 02:59.565
Anyway, I'll see you soon.

03:09.285 --> 03:10.565
Now write a postcard.

03:13.325 --> 03:14.445
Start with "aloha."

04:38.045 --> 04:40.765
<i>The fallout from last night's</i>
Ludie Sypek Show <i>continues.</i>

04:40.845 --> 04:43.405
<i>Koutoufides hires</i>
<i>an ex-con like Harriet Dunkley</i>

04:43.485 --> 04:46.125
<i>and she doesn't even know</i>
<i>who her jailbird mate is?</i>

04:46.605 --> 04:49.485
-Miss Dunkley! Harriet!
-Have you spoken with Mina Almasi?

04:49.565 --> 04:51.405
-Did Karen Koutoufides know...
-Come on!

04:51.485 --> 04:53.485
...your former cellmate was a terrorist?

04:53.565 --> 04:56.365
-Did she kill Bailey for you?
- Just a few words!

04:56.445 --> 04:58.965
-Ah. So she returns.

04:59.045 --> 05:00.925
-Know what that sound is?

05:01.005 --> 05:03.205
The sound of me being unfollowed.

05:03.285 --> 05:05.325
I hired you,
so shit like this wouldn't happen.

05:05.405 --> 05:07.885
Karen, I really... I want you
to take a look at something.

05:08.565 --> 05:11.725
-Here. This is Daniel Houli's phone.

05:16.085 --> 05:19.365
He caught the missile on video.
You can hear it, too.

05:21.045 --> 05:21.885
Hm.

05:24.485 --> 05:25.485
Look.

05:25.565 --> 05:26.965
-You see that?

05:28.045 --> 05:28.965
That's a missile.

05:33.085 --> 05:34.125
This was followed...

05:34.725 --> 05:38.285
by 17 phone calls between Catriona Bailey
and the Chief of Defense.

05:38.365 --> 05:41.325
Then the next day, Lockwood sends
one of his top soldiers to Davoren Park.

05:41.885 --> 05:43.565
And you know this how?

05:44.365 --> 05:47.005
-You don't want to know.
-Have you done something illegal?

05:47.085 --> 05:49.365
-You really don't want to know.
-So you have.

05:50.165 --> 05:52.725
This proves
that the bomb came from the sky.

05:52.805 --> 05:58.605
No, Harriet, this proves a dark shadow in
front of a street lamp for half a second.

05:58.685 --> 06:01.645
Yeah, followed moments later
by an explosion.

06:02.325 --> 06:05.645
Why would the government cover up
an attack? It doesn't make sense.

06:08.445 --> 06:11.005
-What if it's ours?
-Our what?

06:12.445 --> 06:13.405
Drone, maybe.

06:18.285 --> 06:20.285
We run surveillance drones
out of Edinburgh Airbase.

06:20.365 --> 06:22.965
-It's up the road from Davoren Park.
-Yeah, Tritons.

06:23.045 --> 06:25.405
They're used to catch boat people,
but they're not armed.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.645
Even Immigration
hasn't started bombing refugees yet.

06:28.725 --> 06:32.165
But if they had a weaponized drone
program, they'd have to keep it

06:32.245 --> 06:36.485
a safe distance from civilians.
I mean, probably run it out of Woomera.

06:37.045 --> 06:39.045
Not even God knows what goes on out there.

06:43.605 --> 06:44.645
Harriet Dunkley?

06:46.125 --> 06:46.965
Yes?

06:47.245 --> 06:49.725
-Can you come with us, please?
-What's this about?

07:17.765 --> 07:19.445
Do you mind if I call you Caroline?

07:20.045 --> 07:22.405
I do mind.
My mother called me Caroline.

07:24.565 --> 07:25.685
Cal it is, then.

07:27.805 --> 07:29.405
So, why did you run, Cal?

07:30.885 --> 07:33.125
I didn't tell anyone,
if that's what they're worried about.

07:34.005 --> 07:37.805
Tell me what happened that night,
when you were coming home.

07:37.885 --> 07:39.725
-I never left home.
-You know what I mean.

07:41.805 --> 07:43.685
We were on a southeast flight path,

07:43.765 --> 07:46.525
100 nautical miles out from home base
when the link went down.

07:47.045 --> 07:50.085
-Did you report it to Command?
-Not initially, no.

07:50.165 --> 07:52.125
-Why not?
-It happens all the time.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.925
Usually it only lasts a few seconds.

07:55.685 --> 08:00.325
But you waited three minutes
and 36 seconds to inform AOC

08:00.405 --> 08:02.365
that the link had failed to reconnect.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.405
Did you have an episode, Cal?

08:08.445 --> 08:09.405
No.

08:10.005 --> 08:11.125
Then what happened?

08:12.205 --> 08:15.405
It's programmed to fly in
a circular pattern, then return to base

08:15.485 --> 08:19.045
-in the event of a system failure.
-But this wasn't system failure.

08:20.045 --> 08:20.885
No.

08:21.445 --> 08:23.965
-It was like it was possessed.
-Possessed?

08:24.485 --> 08:28.405
-Since day one, plagued by demons.
-The drone or the pilot?

08:34.925 --> 08:36.125
I am not the drone.

08:40.445 --> 08:42.005
It's happening again, isn't it?

08:52.765 --> 08:54.925
I thought this was an ASIO investigation.

08:55.005 --> 08:56.445
It's an inter-agency matter.

08:57.165 --> 08:59.965
And they figure that you'd know
the right buttons to push, is that it?

09:07.485 --> 09:10.645
Did you know the Minister would be
dining with the US ambassador

09:10.725 --> 09:13.405
-at Otis Dining on April 13th?
-No.

09:14.365 --> 09:17.125
Why did you follow Catriona Bailey
into the women's bathroom?

09:17.205 --> 09:19.085
I wanted to go to the toilet, Vaughn.

09:20.085 --> 09:21.485
Is that a crime now, too?

09:22.565 --> 09:26.885
Two years behind bars because of
legislation the Minister pushed through.

09:26.965 --> 09:28.525
It doesn't mean I assassinated her.

09:31.845 --> 09:34.885
You shared a cell with Mina Almasi.

09:36.245 --> 09:40.525
-Did she talk about her husband, Sami?
-We had better things to talk about.

09:41.365 --> 09:45.485
She tell you she took the fall for him,
when she went down for bookkeeping fraud?

09:46.965 --> 09:48.125
Might've come up.

10:03.405 --> 10:06.165
Standard issue
to all Special Forces personnel.

10:06.925 --> 10:10.805
This is the exact type of weapon
used by Catriona Bailey's killer.

10:14.445 --> 10:17.605
What does a military-issue weapon
have to do with Mina Almasi?

10:18.685 --> 10:20.845
Maybe you should be looking
for someone in the military.

10:27.245 --> 10:31.365
Your friend is on a kill-or-capture list,
Harriet.

10:31.925 --> 10:35.285
If you want her alive...
I suggest you bring her in.

10:46.845 --> 10:50.165
<i>Heâ€™s lost the confidence</i>
<i>of not just key members of his party...</i>

10:50.245 --> 10:54.645
It says here we've purchased
ten weaponized Fenrir AOD-Nine drones.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.125
A jet engine with a range
of 25,000 nautical miles,

10:58.205 --> 11:00.405
duration 31 hours
with a full weapons load...

11:01.045 --> 11:03.605
flying altitude, 65,000 feet,
40-meter wingspan

11:03.685 --> 11:06.325
and a top speed of 650 kilometers an hour.

11:06.925 --> 11:11.565
Total price tag, 200 million from
an American manufacturer called Trebuchet.

11:11.645 --> 11:14.045
-Who's spending our money?
-Our defense minister.

11:14.485 --> 11:17.965
Thanks to Hellier, we're now the 11th
biggest military spender in the world.

11:18.485 --> 11:21.245
-Where are they keeping them?
-A factory in San Diego.

11:21.325 --> 11:23.965
-We don't take delivery till 2023.
-You're sure?

11:24.045 --> 11:24.965
According to this.

11:25.045 --> 11:29.165
<i>This is a race against the odds, but</i>
<i>I believe the people of Kingsford Smith</i>

11:29.245 --> 11:33.045
<i>want a genuine alternative</i>
<i>to the more-of-the-same candidate</i>

11:33.125 --> 11:34.525
<i>offered up by this Labor government,</i>

11:34.605 --> 11:37.605
<i>a government that has stopped listening</i>
<i>and--</i>

11:37.685 --> 11:39.845
You think
the Libs can win Bailey's seat?

11:40.765 --> 11:42.525
-Yeah, sure.
- <i>That is my commitment...</i>

11:42.605 --> 11:44.805
And I could ride a unicorn
into the House of Reps.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.405
If you got the balance of power,
you probably could.

11:47.485 --> 11:50.565
<i>I think hard-working Australians</i>
<i>are sick of this government</i>
<i>and their squabbling</i>
<i>and their in-fighting and their lies.</i>

11:53.805 --> 11:56.845
<i>They deserve better</i>
<i>and I intend to see that they get it.</i>

11:57.165 --> 12:01.165
Having ASIO march my senior media advisor
out of Parliament was a cheap stunt,

12:01.245 --> 12:02.405
and you know it.

12:02.725 --> 12:07.365
Well, I make no apologies, Karen.
I'm responsible for the investigation

12:07.445 --> 12:10.085
into the assassination
of a minister of the Crown.

12:10.165 --> 12:13.405
You know Harriet Dunkley had
nothing to do with Bailey's murder.

12:13.485 --> 12:17.645
Then why did she confront Bailey at Otis
three days before she was killed?

12:17.725 --> 12:20.725
That's what you've got?
That's your case?

12:20.805 --> 12:25.125
Well, that, and she did get pretty cozy
with Almasi at Maconochie Prison.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.165
Well, I would've appreciated
a heads-up about this.

12:29.085 --> 12:32.205
Well, it's not quite how ASIO works.
Now, if you'll excuse us.

12:33.605 --> 12:38.445
Before I go, there's a little home video
that I think you might be interested in.

12:51.605 --> 12:54.005
Where did you get this?
Is this the only copy?

12:55.005 --> 12:56.045
Why?

12:56.765 --> 12:59.125
Karen, I don't know
what you think you know,

12:59.205 --> 13:02.805
but I might remind you of your obligations
under the Safer Australia Act.

13:02.885 --> 13:05.605
What I know is
that if this is what it looks like...

13:06.285 --> 13:08.045
you need to release Robbie Lambert.

13:11.565 --> 13:15.365
Uh, get me the ASIO office.
I want Madeline Stenders.

13:15.965 --> 13:17.125
Yes, Minister.

13:18.485 --> 13:19.565
Thank you, Jim.

13:44.045 --> 13:45.245
-Mrs. Houli?
-Yes?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.005
We have a warrant
to search these premises.

13:51.245 --> 13:52.165
Excuse me.

13:53.845 --> 13:54.685
Thank you.

13:57.725 --> 13:59.045
Your phone, where is it?

14:06.365 --> 14:08.485
-Rima.
- <i>ASIO have just raided us.</i>

14:08.565 --> 14:09.805
-Karen.
-What?

14:09.885 --> 14:11.765
<i>-They took everything.</i>
-Ms. Koutoufides?

14:12.805 --> 14:16.125
Under the special powers provision
of the ASIO Act, I have a warrant order

14:16.205 --> 14:19.205
from the minister to seize and remove
a personal item in your possession.

14:20.205 --> 14:21.045
<i>Karen.</i>

14:21.965 --> 14:23.965
Rima, I'm going to have to call you back.

14:33.485 --> 14:34.805
And the USB.

14:39.925 --> 14:40.765
Thank you.

14:44.645 --> 14:46.045
Not a word.

15:03.565 --> 15:05.245
These are your devices, Miss Dunkley.

15:08.765 --> 15:11.485
-You wiped it?
-Questioning warrant.

15:11.565 --> 15:14.725
-You are not permitted to disclose--
-I know, for two years,

15:14.805 --> 15:16.845
or otherwise I'm back inside.

15:21.165 --> 15:22.165
You're free to go.

15:56.965 --> 15:57.845
Where's Mina?

15:59.285 --> 16:00.565
Don't you watch the news?

16:11.645 --> 16:13.405
I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry.

16:15.805 --> 16:19.365
<i>Helen, do you honestly think</i>
<i>that's an option for you?</i>

16:28.325 --> 16:29.725
When's the next consignment?

16:31.805 --> 16:34.005
Later this week. Maybe Friday.

16:35.925 --> 16:38.485
But I have to amend the requisition
order. There's no guarantee--

16:38.565 --> 16:40.005
<i>You'll get it done, Helen.</i>

16:41.885 --> 16:42.765
You always do.

16:46.045 --> 16:48.285
Mina's the only one who knows
the dead-drop location.

16:49.085 --> 16:50.565
Well, you're dealing with me now.

16:51.125 --> 16:52.885
-I'll find out.

16:53.645 --> 16:56.685
Only you at the handover... no one else.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.005
Mm-hm.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.765
Tell me about Pale Horse.

17:30.565 --> 17:33.245
We use a flight path over the Arabian Sea.

17:33.324 --> 17:37.165
We enter Pakistan from Iranian airspace.
We take out high-value targets.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.885
Miramshah, mostly.

17:39.685 --> 17:43.045
Which means we kill the target and
any military-age males in the vicinity.

17:44.045 --> 17:48.485
As in... teenage boys,
who may or not be the enemy?

17:48.965 --> 17:51.005
That's why they call
the targets high value.

17:51.085 --> 17:52.765
It doesn't matter who you kill to get 'em.

17:56.005 --> 17:58.205
You wanted to be a pilot, didn't you, Cal?

17:59.165 --> 18:00.245
I am a pilot.

18:01.485 --> 18:02.725
I meant fighter pilot.

18:04.885 --> 18:07.045
But you were never offered
a place on fighters.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.205
A fighter pilot only gets a fleeting look
at their target.

18:12.645 --> 18:13.725
We watch them...

18:15.085 --> 18:17.725
study them, stalk them.

18:20.965 --> 18:24.885
By the time the command comes through,
we know what color shalwar kameez

18:24.965 --> 18:25.885
they like to wear.

18:27.885 --> 18:30.525
Up close and personal from 10,000 ks away.

18:32.805 --> 18:36.285
Sometimes, when the smoke clears,
there's nothing left of them.

18:40.085 --> 18:44.565
Other times, you see pieces of them
bleeding out on the infrared...

18:45.965 --> 18:50.805
their blood white-hot in the body,
but going cold on the ground.

18:53.045 --> 18:54.685
You watch them stop glowing.

18:56.005 --> 18:59.805
Is that what you saw in Davoren Park, Cal?
Your own countrymen?

19:01.485 --> 19:02.765
A family?

19:04.565 --> 19:07.045
The very people it's your duty to protect.

19:10.005 --> 19:11.845
That's got to have been hard on you.

19:15.205 --> 19:18.205
They rushed those birds into combat ops,
Jane, not me.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.445
I will not go down for this.
This was out of my hands.

19:36.325 --> 19:37.285
Uh, I was, um...

19:38.325 --> 19:40.485
I was leaving a note
for running out on you.

19:40.565 --> 19:42.965
I guess I just got a little spooked.

19:44.605 --> 19:46.765
You did me a favor. Would've regretted it.

19:47.725 --> 19:49.645
Wow, diplomacy's not your strong suit.

19:50.765 --> 19:53.525
Well, in my experience,
diplomacy mostly gets soldiers killed.

19:54.325 --> 19:56.685
-Better than bullets.
-Better than lies.

19:56.765 --> 19:58.405
You can fight back against lies.

19:58.485 --> 20:00.485
Oh, yeah?
How'd that work for you last time?

20:04.645 --> 20:06.245
-You going to invite me in?
-No.

20:16.165 --> 20:18.445
Expensive hotel.
Are my taxes paying for this?

20:18.525 --> 20:19.565
I'm paying for it.

20:19.645 --> 20:23.405
-It must be costing you a fortune.
-What else have I got to spend it on?

20:27.925 --> 20:29.805
I know it was a drone strike
on Davoren Park.

20:31.285 --> 20:32.485
You need to leave my room.

20:33.245 --> 20:36.405
You were sent there less than 24 hours
after the blast. You've been in war zones.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.845
You know what the aftermath
of a Hellfire missile looks like.

20:41.565 --> 20:44.125
Joe, I know that Catriona Bailey
called you at 7:33,
while you were still on site.
What was that about?

20:46.845 --> 20:47.845
It's classified.

20:50.125 --> 20:54.245
Who are you protecting? Bailey's dead.
So are four members of the Lambert family,

20:54.325 --> 20:56.205
and the other one's locked
in the bowels of ASIO.

20:56.285 --> 20:59.845
Yeah, for some of us, Harriet,
classified information is the difference

20:59.925 --> 21:01.165
between life and death.

21:05.965 --> 21:10.445
You familiar with a 9mm Beretta?
Standard military issue, I'm told.

21:10.525 --> 21:14.205
Yeah, there's one in my hotel safe.
You want to see it?

21:16.005 --> 21:17.765
Do you know that Bailey was killed by one?

21:20.725 --> 21:22.405
Doesn't mean the killer was military.

21:24.125 --> 21:26.205
Are you saying you think
they're on the black market?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.205
Goodbye, Harriet.

21:36.485 --> 21:38.885
Of course the Christian right bible boys
are blocking it.

21:39.685 --> 21:42.045
It's pretty hard to read
a climate-change report

21:42.125 --> 21:45.925
when you're so busy self-flagellating.
Thanks. Yeah, hang on a sec.

21:59.685 --> 22:00.565
Fuck.

22:03.805 --> 22:05.285
I'm gonna have to call you back.

22:50.645 --> 22:51.765
What the hell are you doing?

22:51.845 --> 22:55.645
-You didn't answer your burner.
-Because I got brought in by the Agency.

22:56.285 --> 22:58.405
They said you're on
a kill-or-capture list, Mina.

22:58.485 --> 23:01.885
-You got to go. You can't be here.
-I need you to deliver a package.

23:03.125 --> 23:05.245
-What?
-It's Aliah's birthday.

23:05.325 --> 23:07.525
She's having a party... family.

23:08.165 --> 23:10.805
I can't.
I've got ASIO breathing down my neck.

23:10.885 --> 23:13.125
What would it look like
if I showed up at your house?

23:14.965 --> 23:16.245
Mina, listen.

23:17.045 --> 23:19.685
You have got to turn yourself in.
It is the only way.

23:19.765 --> 23:22.365
Do it for your daughter.
I promise I'll keep digging.

23:22.445 --> 23:24.245
Would you turn yourself in
to these people?

23:26.925 --> 23:27.885
I'm begging you.

23:29.565 --> 23:32.085
I've already lost one child.
I can't lose another.

23:33.845 --> 23:36.685
You know they're saying
that a military weapon killed Bailey?

23:41.685 --> 23:43.965
Is Sami dealing black-market ADF weapons?

23:48.285 --> 23:50.805
She's going to be eight years old.

23:56.805 --> 23:57.645
Please.

24:26.605 --> 24:28.405
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

24:29.845 --> 24:32.885
- Have you seen Mina?
-No, are they in here?

24:40.365 --> 24:42.085
-Harriet!
-Happy birthday!

24:44.325 --> 24:46.125
-Special delivery.
-From Mama?

24:46.205 --> 24:47.765
Wait. Give it here.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.205
Sami!

24:53.525 --> 24:54.485
That's mine!

24:58.365 --> 24:59.925
Aliah, <i>hallas</i>.

25:00.005 --> 25:04.685
Okay.
Don't be upset, go play, <i>yalla</i>.

25:05.725 --> 25:08.045
You made her cry on her birthday.
I only wanted to show herâ€¦

25:19.965 --> 25:21.285
You gunrunning, Sami?

25:24.085 --> 25:28.485
Is that what this is about? You got Mina
covering for you just like last time?

25:32.245 --> 25:33.645
My wife grew up in a war zone.

25:36.285 --> 25:37.605
She understands survival.

25:41.045 --> 25:42.325
Enjoy the party, Harriet.

26:16.845 --> 26:18.045
See you tomorrow, boss.
See you tomorrow, Thomas.

27:11.685 --> 27:13.045
Can you keep a secret?

27:21.765 --> 27:23.765
Thank you. Thanks.

27:33.205 --> 27:34.045
Hi.

27:54.325 --> 27:56.205
Okay.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.165
Having a good time, Harriet?

28:18.125 --> 28:19.925
Aliah! Aliah!

28:28.565 --> 28:30.125
Aliah, baby!

28:31.445 --> 28:32.285
Aliah.

28:32.925 --> 28:33.925
Give it to me, darling.

28:34.965 --> 28:37.685
Aliah! Baby! Aliah! Give it to me, darling.
Look at mama. Look at mama.

28:40.485 --> 28:43.085
- Put the weapon down!

28:44.565 --> 28:45.445
Put it down!

28:53.165 --> 28:54.805
Put it down now, slowly...

28:54.885 --> 28:57.805
- Hands where we can see them.
- Get on the ground now!

28:58.805 --> 29:00.885
- Mama!
- Hands behind your back!

29:09.885 --> 29:11.925
I'm sorry, Aliah! I love you!

29:22.605 --> 29:26.245
A stolen ADF 9mm Beretta pistol...

29:27.285 --> 29:31.245
the same type used to kill Bailey, was
found in your possession, in your garage.

29:32.285 --> 29:34.245
We have CCTV footage of you

29:34.325 --> 29:36.685
in the vicinity of the murder site
on the night.

29:37.565 --> 29:39.085
She was dead when I found her.

29:39.445 --> 29:43.525
-Do you think a jury will believe that?
-I didn't want her dead. I wanted answers.

29:44.805 --> 29:46.805
We found this in your house.

29:47.685 --> 29:51.125
A redacted Defense Department document
signed by Catriona Bailey.

29:51.485 --> 29:52.685
It's classified.

29:54.565 --> 29:55.645
Where'd you get it?

29:56.805 --> 29:58.765
It was sent to me anonymously.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.365
By who?

30:02.765 --> 30:04.645
They called themselves the Rabbit.

30:08.845 --> 30:09.805
Mina...

30:11.565 --> 30:14.005
You're going to spend
the rest of your life in maximum.

30:15.485 --> 30:16.525
Now, I can help you.

30:19.085 --> 30:23.005
I can guarantee extended visitation rights
with your daughter if you cooperate.

30:51.485 --> 30:52.685
Sweet dreams.

33:25.445 --> 33:27.245
I thought I could fix it.

33:30.925 --> 33:32.605
The house, our savings.

33:35.885 --> 33:39.765
Do you have any idea
who these people are, Helen?

33:43.165 --> 33:44.525
<i>This compromises me.</i>

33:45.965 --> 33:47.085
<i>It compromises us.</i>

33:51.205 --> 33:52.485
<i>I should have you arrested.</i>

33:53.925 --> 33:55.165
<i>I'm your wife.</i>

33:56.765 --> 33:58.805
-It's for your own sake.
-Bullshit.

34:00.165 --> 34:01.285
It's for yours.

34:03.605 --> 34:05.805
<i>You've gambled away</i>
<i>most of the payment away.</i>

34:06.365 --> 34:09.845
<i>Now we can't return it.</i>
<i>What are you going to do, Helen?</i>

34:11.285 --> 34:12.885
<i>The only thing I can do.</i>

34:18.724 --> 34:20.164
Did you put cameras in here?

34:26.405 --> 34:27.925
<i>William, are they in the bedroom?</i>

34:46.724 --> 34:49.565
Hey. It's a school night, Alex.

34:50.885 --> 34:53.204
You realize this is what
most teenagers do on a school night.

34:53.845 --> 34:56.684
In fact, drinking wine this expensive
would be a step up.

34:59.525 --> 35:02.285
I've got 25% youth unemployment
in my electorate.
There are kids not much older than my son
that have nothing better to do

35:05.565 --> 35:09.565
than smoke meth for breakfast.
They need a job, a future.

35:10.765 --> 35:12.965
All roads lead to Wakefield with you,
don't they?

35:14.445 --> 35:17.605
-That's why I'm here.
-In Canberra, or having dinner with me?

35:21.485 --> 35:22.405
Both.

35:24.245 --> 35:26.245
-Okay, question.
-Mm-hm.

35:28.085 --> 35:29.565
Why do I have your attention?

35:32.805 --> 35:34.125
It's my job to hedge bets.

35:36.285 --> 35:37.405
Cover the market.

35:38.685 --> 35:40.485
And you winning the balance of power

35:40.565 --> 35:42.685
on Saturday is not beyond the realms.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.245
God. How much have you had to drink?

35:44.325 --> 35:46.725
-You haven't considered the possibility?
-No.

35:47.725 --> 35:48.885
I think you have.

35:50.445 --> 35:52.165
I think you've imagined
what it would be like

35:52.245 --> 35:54.645
to have those smug career politicians
have to shut up

35:54.725 --> 35:56.365
and listen to Karen Koutoufides.

35:56.445 --> 35:58.925
They are afraid of you.
People believe in you.

35:59.005 --> 36:01.445
Just look at your Twitter feed.
You say exactly what you think.

36:03.325 --> 36:06.605
Want to try telling my senior
media advisor that's a good thing?

36:07.285 --> 36:08.885
If Harriet Dunkley knew her job,

36:08.965 --> 36:11.565
she'd know you can't buy
that kind of authenticity.

36:11.645 --> 36:14.525
Good... because I'm not for sale.

36:37.525 --> 36:40.085
Where does that sit
in the Lobbying Code of Conduct?

36:41.645 --> 36:44.965
-They're more guidelines than codes.
-Mm.

36:45.045 --> 36:49.165
Come Saturday, you're going to realize
that you slept with me for nothing.

37:07.085 --> 37:09.205
-Daniel.
- <i>Why did you give it to them?</i>

37:09.725 --> 37:11.685
<i>That was private between me and Chloe.</i>

37:11.765 --> 37:13.165
What are you talking about?

37:13.245 --> 37:15.965
<i>It's all over the TV.</i>
<i>She didn't deserve this.</i>

37:17.005 --> 37:18.325
-We-- Daniel?

37:18.405 --> 37:20.605
<i>Now the footage has come to light,</i>

37:20.685 --> 37:22.645
<i>the whole of Australia needs to know.</i>

37:22.725 --> 37:26.165
<i>Have we been bombed</i>
<i>and are we under attack?</i>

37:26.245 --> 37:29.405
Harrowing footage there
from the explosion at Davoren Park...

37:30.125 --> 37:33.125
that raises critical questions
of the Garrity government.

37:34.165 --> 37:38.005
And we have Defense Minister
and acting Minister for Home Affairs,

37:38.085 --> 37:39.245
thank you, Jim Hellier.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.565
First of all,
you had us believe it was a gas leak

37:42.645 --> 37:46.165
and then you arrest a 16-year-old boy
for blowing up his own family.

37:46.245 --> 37:50.285
<i>Surely, Minister, this video exposes</i>
<i>what appears to be a massive cover-up?</i>

37:50.685 --> 37:53.645
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>that I've seen this footage, Ludie,</i>

37:53.725 --> 37:55.365
<i>and I don't know where it's come from.</i>

37:56.405 --> 38:00.245
<i>Um, and I want the public not to jump</i>
<i>to any major conclusions.</i>

38:01.005 --> 38:04.605
-For all we know, this could be a hoax.
-A hoax, by who?
<i>Well, the militant collective</i>
<i>that Robbie Lambert was associated with--</i>

38:08.885 --> 38:11.445
- <i>He's a 16-year-old.</i>
<i>-There's evidence that he's been</i>

38:11.525 --> 38:13.405
<i>-associated with these people.</i>

38:13.485 --> 38:16.525
<i>We believe they were planning</i>
<i>a major act of terrorism--</i>

38:16.805 --> 38:18.525
<i>Did you not hear the sound,</i>
<i>Minister?</i>

38:18.605 --> 38:21.445
That was from an incoming missile
from above.

38:21.525 --> 38:24.405
-Ian, if you'd just let me finish...
-No, you keep going.

38:24.485 --> 38:25.805
-Thank you.
-Keep digging.

38:25.885 --> 38:28.285
All right. I just think it's important
for you to know

38:28.365 --> 38:33.165
that we actually have had this footage
examined by two independent experts...

38:33.645 --> 38:36.205
a former chief of defense,
General Duncan McAuliffe,

38:36.285 --> 38:39.205
a man you know well,
and Professor Alan Goodrich,

38:39.285 --> 38:41.485
head of the National Security College
at ANU,

38:41.565 --> 38:45.525
and both men confirm
the veracity of the footage.

38:50.285 --> 38:53.205
I think it's high time
this government was held to account.

38:53.525 --> 38:58.565
And the people of Kingsford Smith will
make their voices heard loud and clear

38:58.645 --> 39:01.645
on behalf of all Australians
at this Saturday's by-election.

39:04.285 --> 39:08.765
<i>What this video shows is</i>
<i>that an innocent familyâ€™s home was bombed.</i>

39:08.845 --> 39:10.085
<i>The question is, by who.</i>

39:10.165 --> 39:12.965
<i>...US Ambassadorâ€™s</i>
<i>car has arrived in the PM's courtyard</i>

39:13.045 --> 39:15.045
<i>for a meeting with Prime Minister Garrity</i>

39:28.205 --> 39:29.725
Someone better start talking.

39:32.245 --> 39:34.805
Prime Minister,
the explosion at Davoren Park

39:34.885 --> 39:38.125
was caused
by an AMG 114 Hellfire missile...

39:38.965 --> 39:44.325
released as a result of a system failure
on a Fenrir AOD Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.

39:45.045 --> 39:47.165
-A weaponized drone?
- Yes, sir.

39:47.245 --> 39:50.925
Whose? I wasn't aware we were
taking possession of those until 2023.

39:52.525 --> 39:54.045
For the, uh...

39:55.325 --> 39:58.725
For the past six months,
we've been running a black-ops mission,

39:58.805 --> 40:01.205
codenamed Pale Horse, out of Woomera.

40:02.565 --> 40:05.965
The program is deep alliance,
with a US chain of command.

40:07.125 --> 40:11.445
It's, uh... It's a highly classified
joint operation in Northwest Pakistan.

40:12.165 --> 40:15.085
Our strikes have seriously weakened
the Haqqani Network

40:15.165 --> 40:18.325
and taken out high-value targets
with minimum collateral damage.

40:18.405 --> 40:21.205
-Kill missions?
-Yes, sir.

40:21.285 --> 40:24.165
Without my knowledge
or authority, Air Chief Marshal!

40:24.725 --> 40:26.925
Has there been some sort of coup
that I'm not aware of?
This is a violation
of Pakistani sovereignty,

40:29.285 --> 40:31.045
of international laws of engagement--

40:31.125 --> 40:35.805
"No more dead soldiers. Flags on coffins."
Those are your words, Prime Minister.

40:36.845 --> 40:40.645
Pale Horse is a way of achieving that.
It's the only way of achieving that.

40:40.725 --> 40:44.325
The theater of war has changed, sir.
The whole world is a battlefield.

40:44.405 --> 40:46.325
Including a suburban home in Davoren Park?

40:47.205 --> 40:48.765
Four innocent people... children.

40:53.085 --> 40:54.205
Who else knew about this?

40:55.125 --> 40:56.205
Catriona Bailey knew.

40:59.005 --> 41:00.325
Well, that's convenient.

41:01.285 --> 41:02.525
The dead can't speak.

41:04.325 --> 41:07.525
-I want all missions grounded.
-It's been done.

41:10.125 --> 41:11.085
I want the room.

41:13.245 --> 41:17.605
Prime Minister... is there a message
you'd like to convey back to Washington?

41:19.045 --> 41:19.885
Yes.

41:21.045 --> 41:24.605
That as of this moment,
the alliance is a matter of contention...

41:25.045 --> 41:26.405
and that includes Pine Gap.

41:36.885 --> 41:39.645
-Did you know?
-I had no idea.

41:43.405 --> 41:44.485
Heads will roll, Jim.

41:45.605 --> 41:48.445
Starting with that fucking Judas,
Lockwood!

41:50.045 --> 41:52.685
Look, if you sack Lockwood,
you're telling the public

41:52.765 --> 41:56.885
that you have no control over
your armed forces. It'll be a bloodbath...

41:58.165 --> 41:59.765
and the truth will kill us.

42:36.325 --> 42:39.285
-I know what you're doing.
-What are we doing?

42:39.365 --> 42:40.685
Trying to mess with my head.

42:42.045 --> 42:44.405
The kill list... cause a relapse.

42:45.005 --> 42:46.725
It'd be easier for you
if I just wasn't here.

42:50.965 --> 42:53.805
Did you know your kill number was 448?

42:54.485 --> 42:57.765
You think I keep count?
I don't get to decide who lives or dies.

43:00.125 --> 43:01.925
I don't know
why you didn't just take me out.

43:03.405 --> 43:06.285
Because you're a valued member
of the team, Caroline.

43:19.965 --> 43:22.685
Rima, hello. It's Harriet Dunkley.

43:23.765 --> 43:27.325
Um, listen,
I need to get something translated

43:27.405 --> 43:30.125
and I was wondering,
by any chance, do you read Arabic?

43:32.365 --> 43:33.205
Great.

45:01.245 --> 45:03.205
I said come alone or the deal was off.

45:04.125 --> 45:05.925
Mustafa, get the gear.

45:22.325 --> 45:23.165
Fuck.

45:28.805 --> 45:29.725
Oh, God.

46:00.925 --> 46:02.165
Get in the van, Helen.

46:05.925 --> 46:07.085
Get in the van.

46:52.565 --> 46:53.525
Robbie.

46:57.965 --> 46:59.885
Hey. You okay?

47:03.725 --> 47:06.485
The Houlis want you to... stay with them.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.125
And I've organized for you to see someone.

47:10.925 --> 47:13.765
-A lot of people care about you.
-I just want to get out of here.

47:13.845 --> 47:16.605
Yeah, okay. Come on. Let's go.

48:28.045 --> 48:29.085
Morning.

48:33.445 --> 48:37.645
Pale Horse is the codename
for what has been until now...

48:38.445 --> 48:42.565
a top-secret military training exercise
conducted in Central Australia...

48:43.365 --> 48:49.165
using armed, unmanned aerial vehicles,
purchased by the Department of Defense.

48:50.405 --> 48:52.125
On April 12th...

48:54.165 --> 48:58.645
a system failure occurred,
resulting in the tragedy at Davoren Park.

49:00.085 --> 49:02.285
We would ask the media to respect

49:02.365 --> 49:05.525
the surviving victim
Robbie Lambert's privacy at this time...

49:06.565 --> 49:09.205
as he deals with an unimaginable loss.

49:09.285 --> 49:12.965
Minister, are you saying the Australian
military murdered its own citizens?

49:18.765 --> 49:21.405
Where have you been?
It's all going off here!

49:21.485 --> 49:23.765
I thought you said
you weren't like other politicians.

49:23.845 --> 49:26.045
-I'm not.
-No. You copied that drone footage

49:26.125 --> 49:27.365
and gave it to Ludie.

49:27.445 --> 49:29.085
It was the only way
to get Robbie released.

49:29.165 --> 49:30.965
Yeah, and change
the course of the by-election.

49:31.045 --> 49:34.845
And I thought you took this job
so you could work for me, not Mina Almasi.

49:34.925 --> 49:36.045
As your media advisor,

49:36.125 --> 49:39.925
I would recommend sacking me. That would
be the smart choice, especially now.

49:40.005 --> 49:43.045
They've called it!
Casey's just won Bailey's seat.

49:43.125 --> 49:45.765
<i>Heâ€™s conceding.</i>
<i>McCulloch is conceding...</i>

49:45.845 --> 49:49.005
-Karen Koutoufides' office.
-You're not going to resign, are you?

49:49.085 --> 49:52.805
-Things are getting interesting.
-KK, it's the Prime Minister's Office.

49:58.725 --> 49:59.565
Prime Minister.

50:01.085 --> 50:03.925
I guess you'll be needing my support
on confidence and supply.

50:18.885 --> 50:22.645
-Thank you, Prime Minister. Yes, sir.

50:22.725 --> 50:25.205
So, when I come back out,
will you still be here?

50:30.285 --> 50:31.365
Yeah, I'll be here.

50:36.125 --> 50:36.965
Karen.

50:38.445 --> 50:39.845
-Ewan.
-Wonderful to see you.

50:39.925 --> 50:41.125
-Hey.
-Please, come in.
