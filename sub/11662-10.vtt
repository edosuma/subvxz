(mellow music playing)

00:49.600 --> 00:51.000
There you go.

01:04.266 --> 01:07.000
Hi, Sophia.
How was your date last night?

01:07.066 --> 01:09.533
Tony Delveccio is a dreamboat.

01:10.033 --> 01:12.834
I wouldn't mind glancing over
at the night table

01:12.900 --> 01:15.200
and seeing his teeth next to mine.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.734
Ma, please.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.433
I mean, it's probably silly,
but I'm not that comfortable

01:23.500 --> 01:26.934
hearing about your romantic escapades
with men.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.233
Then you're going to hate this.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.900
I fantasize about him all day.

01:32.367 --> 01:35.800
Last night I dreamed I was Joan of Arc
and he was coming at me with a hose.

01:38.633 --> 01:42.433
Ma, maybe it was just
a religious experience dream.

01:44.233 --> 01:45.667
Did he put out the fire?

01:48.433 --> 01:49.800
Three times.

01:53.834 --> 01:54.934
Wow.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.467
The seldom achieved
Joan of Arc fantasy triple.

02:01.066 --> 02:03.000
Sophia, I hate you.

02:04.266 --> 02:10.300
I think I'm falling in love,
but Tony looks at me as a friend.

02:10.367 --> 02:12.266
Nothing wrong with that.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.934
Yeah. But I'm picturing him naked,
and I'm not laughing.

02:17.934 --> 02:21.400
If you want my advice,
I think you should sleep with him.

02:21.467 --> 02:22.567
Done.

02:24.266 --> 02:26.200
That is not what she wants.

02:26.266 --> 02:28.867
Dorothy, the man came at her with a hose.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.467
Oh, come on, Ma,
you haven't known him that long.

02:34.533 --> 02:35.900
Take your time.

02:35.967 --> 02:38.667
After a few months,
better yet, a few years,

02:38.734 --> 02:42.767
then you can start thinking about
a more physical relationship.

02:42.834 --> 02:44.700
Look who's giving away years here.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.333
You know my motto, today could be
the last day of the rest of your life.

02:52.567 --> 02:58.500
With a few tips from me, you can have this
guy Tony in bed in no time.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.100
That's good, because that's exactly
how much time we have.

03:03.500 --> 03:07.166
-My mother does not do that.
-Yes, I do.

03:07.233 --> 03:08.767
I've just been in dry dock.

03:10.934 --> 03:12.133
I'm back now.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.166
I'm suited up, coach. Put me in the game.

03:17.033 --> 03:19.600
Ok. But you listen to everything I say.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.033
When I say "Jump," you say "On who?"

03:25.333 --> 03:27.633
(calm music playing)

03:27.700 --> 03:30.667
I got a special delivery
letter from St. Olaf.

03:30.734 --> 03:31.800
Uh-oh.

03:31.867 --> 03:34.100
It's from the department
of water and coffee.

03:39.066 --> 03:40.467
Coffee?

03:40.533 --> 03:42.166
No, thanks. It makes me jumpy.

03:45.233 --> 03:48.467
-What does the letter say?
-You read it, Dorothy.

03:48.533 --> 03:51.734
I need both hands to cover my ears
in case it's bad news.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.734
"Dear St. Olafian,
I'm afraid there's bad news."

03:56.800 --> 03:57.867
What?

04:00.367 --> 04:03.834
"There's a drought in St. Olaf
which threatens the crops."

04:03.900 --> 04:06.200
Oh, no. I better send water.

04:09.967 --> 04:16.100
"Please do not send water.
We have found that envelopes leak."

04:17.867 --> 04:21.867
"Until the rains come,
we ask that all citizens be celibate,

04:21.934 --> 04:26.200
except for Ulf, the umbrella king.
He has suffered enough."

04:28.700 --> 04:30.700
If it will help bring in the crops...

04:30.767 --> 04:35.066
Oh, you cannot possibly believe that
abstaining is gonna change the weather.

04:35.133 --> 04:38.934
Blanche, I don't think you realize
how powerful sex is.

04:45.133 --> 04:48.934
Once Charlie and I actually did it
till the cows came home.

04:53.433 --> 04:55.300
Of course, I was wearing a bell.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.734
Of course, hence the nickname "ding dong."

05:03.133 --> 05:05.000
Hey, you're probably right.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.834
Rose, if you're serious
about going through with this,

05:10.900 --> 05:13.700
you should discuss it with Miles.

05:13.767 --> 05:17.367
-He deserves to know the truth.
-I don't want to lie.

05:17.433 --> 05:21.000
You don't have to lie.
Just don't tell the truth.

05:21.066 --> 05:23.000
Turn this to your advantage.

05:23.433 --> 05:26.834
If you hold Miles at bay,
amazing things will start to happen.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.633
He'll become more attentive,
he'll send you flowers,

05:29.700 --> 05:32.600
he'll be a prisoner of love,
and you'll be the warden.

05:34.033 --> 05:37.867
And if you're interested,
I have costumes for both of you to rent.

05:39.100 --> 05:44.100
Blanche. First you tell my mother
to sleep with a stranger. Now this?

05:44.166 --> 05:47.667
What makes you think
you know everything about men?

05:47.734 --> 05:52.734
The record speaks for itself.
I have had 143 relationships.

05:54.834 --> 05:56.500
And no conviction.

05:58.767 --> 06:04.633
(serene music playing)

06:05.700 --> 06:09.233
-What do you think?
-You look very pretty tonight.

06:09.600 --> 06:14.567
-Not too pretty, I hope. I'm seeing Miles.
-How's he dealing with the celibacy?

06:14.633 --> 06:16.233
Well, he's doing fine...

06:16.700 --> 06:19.700
although he does spend a lot of time
at the batting cage.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.734
Rose, listen, you have
a very critical date coming up.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.200
Everything I said would happen has.

06:27.266 --> 06:29.567
He's been more attentive,
he's sent you flowers,

06:29.633 --> 06:32.567
he's done your laundry
and returned most of it.

06:39.133 --> 06:40.467
We're right on schedule.

06:40.533 --> 06:43.700
But tonight he'll ask if
you're seeing other men.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.133
What do you say?

06:45.200 --> 06:47.667
-I'm not sure.
-Just be bold.

06:47.734 --> 06:51.667
Be brazen, be brutal. What will you say?

06:52.166 --> 06:53.734
I'm not sure.

06:58.467 --> 07:02.433
If you're going to be my lump of clay,
you've got to be a little smarter.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.300
When he asks if
you're seeing other men,

07:06.367 --> 07:11.834
just tweak his nose and say, "My, my, sir.
I do believe you're jealous."

07:14.600 --> 07:19.333
What about the vapors, Blanche?
Shouldn't she be overcome by the vapors?

07:21.300 --> 07:25.166
-Blanche, can I come out now?
-Oh, yeah. Hold it just minute.

07:25.233 --> 07:26.567
All right, girls.

07:26.633 --> 07:30.433
I want to present
Blanche Devereaux' latest creation.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.300
I took an 84-year-old woman

07:33.367 --> 07:37.500
and made her look like a 65-year-old
drag queen.

07:47.266 --> 07:50.700
Then I said to myself,
"Blanche, too much rouge."

07:52.567 --> 07:59.567
So, after a few minor adjustments,
may I present the new Sophia Petrillo.

08:15.734 --> 08:17.667
Ma, are you in there?

08:21.500 --> 08:24.734
This is the first time in years
I've felt like the real me.

08:26.133 --> 08:27.400
Should these be lower?

08:28.367 --> 08:31.600
-(doorbell rings)
-This is it.

08:31.667 --> 08:34.166
Don't forget,
you've got something he wants.

08:34.233 --> 08:35.800
Yeah. What?

08:38.533 --> 08:40.934
Don't worry. It will all come back to you.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.000
Take your glasses off.

08:43.433 --> 08:47.800
And it's a good idea if you can find
something to compliment him on.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.867
Hi. Is it my imagination

08:52.934 --> 08:54.934
or do you have less hair
on your knuckles?

08:57.567 --> 08:59.233
Well, it could be, Sophia.

08:59.300 --> 09:04.567
-At my age, everything starts to go.
-Sophia, it's Miles.

09:04.633 --> 09:07.400
Hey, you look beautiful.

09:07.734 --> 09:10.233
It has been a long time for you,
hasn't it?

09:14.400 --> 09:18.467
Well, let's get started, Rose.
There's magic in the air tonight.

09:21.367 --> 09:24.100
What if he wants to go to his place?

09:24.533 --> 09:28.033
-Tell him you have work at home.
-I don't want to lie.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.734
When you get home,
we'll make you clean out the garage.

09:34.367 --> 09:36.433
Thanks, Blanche. I owe you one.

09:40.033 --> 09:43.367
What if Tony doesn't even notice me?

09:43.433 --> 09:46.100
That's his hard luck.
There are other fish.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.400
All the ones my age
are floating on top.

09:50.333 --> 09:51.934
(doorbell rings)

09:53.300 --> 09:55.667
Now, Ma, remember,
don't do anything I wouldn't do.

09:55.734 --> 09:57.967
I crossed that line when I got a date.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.934
-Hi, Sophia.
-Hi.

10:09.033 --> 10:11.467
You remember Blanche
and my aunt Dorothy?

10:11.533 --> 10:12.533
Yea...

10:14.800 --> 10:17.367
-Nice to see you.
-Nice to see you again.

10:17.433 --> 10:18.867
Thank you.

10:18.934 --> 10:20.967
Sophia, you look enchanting.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.266
If I wasn't a gentleman,
I'd ply you with wine

10:24.333 --> 10:25.967
and take advantage of you.

10:26.033 --> 10:27.834
There's a liquor store on the corner.

10:31.767 --> 10:34.533
She can't drink.
It mixes with her medication.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.834
Beautifully.

10:38.767 --> 10:42.266
-Aren't they adorable?
-Seems like only yesterday

10:42.333 --> 10:44.266
I was putting her into the home.

10:47.367 --> 10:49.767
Good night, pussycat. Don't worry.

10:49.834 --> 10:51.967
-Ma, be good.
-I promise.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.033
You're good.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.500
A promise is a promise.

11:11.033 --> 11:15.367
Where did a sweet Sicilian girl like you
learn to do those things?

11:16.100 --> 11:17.633
I live with a slut.

11:21.867 --> 11:23.300
Thank her for me.

11:24.300 --> 11:28.000
Oh, it's nice to be with a real woman.

11:28.767 --> 11:32.700
-You didn't think I was too forward?
-No, you were a perfect lady.

11:33.133 --> 11:35.233
And, once again,
don't worry about the pants.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.300
I know a lot of good tailors.

11:40.100 --> 11:44.333
You started it. Don't think I didn't
notice you playing footsie tonight.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.333
No, that really was a spasm.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.734
I, uh...

11:57.767 --> 12:00.000
I... love you.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.567
-I said... I love you.
-Thank you.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.400
And you?

12:12.033 --> 12:13.400
I care for you.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.767
-You care for me?
-Yes, very much.

12:18.433 --> 12:21.000
I probably should have said that sooner.

12:21.633 --> 12:25.166
Well, let's go get some sleep now.

12:29.867 --> 12:32.200
-What?
-You care for me?

12:32.266 --> 12:34.734
You care for a cat or a goat.

12:35.433 --> 12:38.033
I say I love you,
and you say you care for me?

12:38.100 --> 12:41.367
I care for you a lot.

12:41.700 --> 12:46.100
-Don't bother to drive me home.
-Oh, look, Sophia. Can't we talk?

12:46.166 --> 12:49.233
Don't even say my name.
I reached out for you.

12:49.567 --> 12:52.266
If you didn't love me,
how the hell could you make love to me?

12:52.834 --> 12:55.100
I never want to see or hear from you
again.

12:56.934 --> 13:03.333
(calm music playing)

13:05.967 --> 13:09.133
Good night and thank you
for a wonderful evening.

13:09.467 --> 13:13.500
Rose, what is going on?
Something is wrong.

13:13.567 --> 13:14.900
What do you mean?

13:14.967 --> 13:18.233
It's obvious you're trying to avoid
any kind of intimacy.

13:18.633 --> 13:20.900
That place you dragged me to tonight.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.934
Don't get me wrong,
I enjoyed the evening of lesbian poetry.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.533
But, look, Rose, to tell you the truth,

13:35.600 --> 13:39.233
it just wasn't the swell time
I had in mind.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.100
But I'm starting to get
a little suspicious.

13:43.533 --> 13:45.467
There's somebody else, isn't there?

13:47.767 --> 13:50.667
My, my, sir.
I do believe you're jealous.

13:56.233 --> 13:58.867
You know, normally I hate it
when people tweak my nose,

13:58.934 --> 14:01.667
but at least you're touching me.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.400
Look, are you seeing somebody else?

14:04.467 --> 14:07.333
My, my, sir. I do believe you're jealous.

14:07.400 --> 14:12.166
One tweak is cute is cute, Rose.
Two is... don't do it again.

14:14.266 --> 14:17.333
I'm sorry for the tone,
but I am a little cranky and tense...

14:17.767 --> 14:19.333
for all the obvious reasons.

14:20.967 --> 14:24.233
Something is wrong.
Are you seeing another man?

14:24.767 --> 14:26.166
And don't touch my nose.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.967
I just can't be with you now.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.800
Oh, well.

14:34.233 --> 14:35.433
All right, maybe...

14:36.300 --> 14:37.800
maybe I can't see you either.

14:38.633 --> 14:39.734
Goodbye.

14:40.166 --> 14:41.567
You mean good night.

14:42.033 --> 14:43.700
No, I think I mean goodbye.

14:53.333 --> 14:54.500
(door slams)

14:55.266 --> 14:56.433
Oh!

14:57.767 --> 15:00.533
Just as I thought. Nobody likes it.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.367
-Rose, what's the matter?
-Miles just left me.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.100
Way to go, Blanche.

15:06.166 --> 15:09.667
Because of you and your lousy advice,
I've lost Miles.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.800
If you come on with this attitude
and tweak my nose,

15:12.867 --> 15:15.567
don't ever do that again
because I hate it...

15:17.000 --> 15:18.400
I'm not going to help you.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.934
-(door slams)
-How was your date?

15:22.867 --> 15:25.100
Do you enjoy getting
old ladies in trouble?

15:30.367 --> 15:32.633
Ma, you slept with him, didn't you?

15:34.033 --> 15:35.533
Ma, come over here.

15:39.333 --> 15:40.967
Look me in the eye.

15:42.033 --> 15:44.100
Did you sleep with Tony Delveccio?

15:45.100 --> 15:46.133
A little.

15:47.300 --> 15:49.633
-Ma!
-Blanche made me.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.433
Don't you have a mind of your own?

15:51.734 --> 15:55.800
If Gladys Goldfein told you to drink
a bottle of Kaopectate, would you?

15:55.867 --> 15:56.867
Who blabbed?

15:59.433 --> 16:02.166
Everybody, just calm down.

16:02.233 --> 16:05.500
-Sophia, tell me what happened.
-Same old story.

16:05.567 --> 16:09.600
Girl meets boy, girl loses boy,
girl can't remember her address,

16:09.667 --> 16:12.934
so cab just circles and circles
and circles.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.934
You said you loved him,
and he didn't say it back?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.400
Did you bug my bra?

16:21.200 --> 16:24.834
Sophia, I told you never tell a man
you love him first.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.800
That's a fatal mistake.

16:26.867 --> 16:30.100
I wanted to hear someone
say I love you to me once more.

16:30.567 --> 16:31.834
Oh, Ma.

16:32.166 --> 16:35.633
Would it make you feel better
if I told you I love you?

16:36.100 --> 16:38.700
Yeah. All of a sudden,
I feel like singing.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.500
Take me to a piano bar.

16:42.533 --> 16:43.800
I'm going to sleep.

16:43.867 --> 16:46.800
If Tony calls, tell him I faked it.

16:54.467 --> 16:55.633
Ma!

16:56.100 --> 16:59.633
Well, I did. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Oh, baby.
Oh, please!

17:01.567 --> 17:07.867
(mellow music playing)

17:10.800 --> 17:15.700
-Come on, Sophia, join us.
-Ma, you can't wait for a call forever.

17:15.767 --> 17:19.300
-Who's waiting for a call?
-(whistles)

17:19.367 --> 17:21.166
Hello? Hello?

17:22.533 --> 17:25.066
That was him.
I could hear him breathing.

17:26.533 --> 17:30.300
He wants to make sure I'm home
and not out with another guy.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.266
I have to make him jealous.

17:32.333 --> 17:34.934
Put on a suit and a tie.
Let's go by his hotel.

17:36.367 --> 17:38.567
I'm not putting on a suit and tie.

17:38.633 --> 17:41.600
Are you satisfied, Blanche?
My mother wants to date me.

17:45.166 --> 17:47.367
I suppose that's my fault, too.

17:47.433 --> 17:50.867
You have been giving out very bad advice.

17:51.233 --> 17:54.700
I haven't had such bad advice
since my drama teacher told me

17:54.767 --> 17:57.467
I'd be perfect for the lead
in <i>The King and I.</i>

17:59.834 --> 18:02.767
So stupid here shaves her head
and doesn't get the part.

18:05.633 --> 18:08.567
Don't think I don't know
what you're getting at.

18:08.967 --> 18:12.667
You think my advice was bad
because it devastated four lives.

18:12.734 --> 18:15.734
When are you going to realize
you have to be responsible?

18:15.800 --> 18:17.266
This isn't a game.

18:17.333 --> 18:21.000
You're playing with emotions
of real human beings.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.767
I'm going to go see Tony.

18:22.834 --> 18:26.000
Don't do that.
He's right where you want him.

18:26.066 --> 18:28.300
I'm not listening to you.
Dorothy was right.

18:28.367 --> 18:30.600
You got me and Rose into trouble.

18:30.667 --> 18:33.400
You'd get Dorothy into trouble
if anyone was interested.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.633
Wait a minute.

18:38.967 --> 18:41.934
Why, just the other day
that guy who works with our Gardiner,

18:41.967 --> 18:43.567
you know, the one with the leaf blower...

18:45.233 --> 18:46.967
told me that I looked nice.

18:47.033 --> 18:51.967
With a little lilt in his voice
and tried to blow my skirt over my head.

18:55.533 --> 18:57.934
Everything but the white horse,
huh, pussycat?

18:59.700 --> 19:02.433
Look, Sophia Petrillo doesn't give up.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.900
She's fights for her man.
She can overcome anything.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.834
She needs 10 bucks for a cab.

19:12.033 --> 19:16.000
(serene music playing)

19:16.667 --> 19:19.066
Last chance, Rose.

19:19.133 --> 19:22.667
Oh, no. I'm too depressed to go
to a firehouse.

19:24.700 --> 19:27.633
I can bring a friend to the barbecue.

19:28.266 --> 19:32.333
Come on, Rose. They're firemen.
After a couple of drinks, they do CPR.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.033
I envy you, Blanche.
You really have it together.

19:38.633 --> 19:41.200
Not me. I have too many hang-ups.

19:41.266 --> 19:42.900
Good night.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.200
Rose, I think you ought to know something.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.033
I didn't tell you.

19:51.100 --> 19:55.567
I never told anybody,
but I cry every Thursday night.

19:56.033 --> 19:58.033
I thought you were so happy.

19:58.100 --> 20:03.500
I am most of the time, but, hey, it's hard
being Blanche Devereaux all the time.

20:03.900 --> 20:06.033
It begins to take its toll.

20:06.100 --> 20:12.233
It's kind of lonely not having someone
nice and decent like Miles.

20:13.433 --> 20:17.967
My advice works with my men,
the shallow guys I go out with.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.467
But if you still want my advice...

20:21.567 --> 20:22.700
here it is.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.400
Call Miles.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.133
Honey, Blanche is right.
He's reasonable. He'll understand.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.867
I'm going to call him
and tell him the truth. You were right.

20:33.934 --> 20:37.900
-The truth is always the best.
-That is very wise, Rose.

20:37.967 --> 20:40.433
I didn't just make that up.

20:43.533 --> 20:48.000
I saw it this afternoon on TV
when I was watching <i>The New Lassie.</i>

20:50.867 --> 20:53.600
That's actually an interesting story.

20:53.667 --> 20:56.100
The new Timmy was lost,

20:56.166 --> 21:00.033
and the new Lassie was trying to tell the
new grandpa where he was--

21:00.100 --> 21:03.900
Rose, did I ever tell you
that I cry every Tuesday?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.700
At 8:05.

21:08.567 --> 21:09.734
Excuse me.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.567
(telephone rings)

21:17.667 --> 21:18.667
Hello.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.867
Oh, Helgie. What's going on in St. Olaf?

21:24.000 --> 21:27.433
I can't understand you, honey.
Are you moaning?

21:28.333 --> 21:30.300
No, say it slowly.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.767
Oh, God, it's raining.

21:34.567 --> 21:37.667
Oh, God... it's raining.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.233
Oh, God...

21:43.333 --> 21:45.200
oh, God, it's raining!

21:45.900 --> 21:47.800
Here. I've got to get to Miles.

21:56.767 --> 21:58.533
Boy, it must be pouring.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.667
(calm music playing)

22:02.734 --> 22:04.300
(knock on door)

22:09.533 --> 22:12.500
Sophia. It's good to see you.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.633
I came by to pick up
my medic alert bracelet.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.667
I believe I left it here last week.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.633
I'm wearing it.

22:21.700 --> 22:22.900
That's dangerous.

22:22.967 --> 22:26.367
It turns out we're allergic
to the same things.

22:26.433 --> 22:28.633
-Aw...
-Aw...

22:29.433 --> 22:30.967
I've missed you.

22:31.033 --> 22:34.700
-So much you haven't called me?
-Sophia, sit down.

22:36.233 --> 22:40.467
I picked up that phone a hundred times,
but I couldn't make that call.

22:41.133 --> 22:43.600
I haven't told anyone I loved them
since...

22:44.300 --> 22:46.066
since my wife died.

22:46.133 --> 22:47.734
That's a long time ago.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.667
But this I care for you thing
has worked up until now.

22:53.467 --> 22:54.800
Sophia...

22:55.700 --> 22:57.133
I do love you.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.433
I love you, too.

23:04.066 --> 23:05.934
So what do we do now?

23:08.066 --> 23:10.567
You want to see pictures of my late wife?

23:12.967 --> 23:15.967
I thought you'd never ask.
I brought some of my husband Sal.

23:23.934 --> 23:29.800
(theme music playing)
