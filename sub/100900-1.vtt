00:48.831 --> 00:50.006
[horse snorts]

00:51.703 --> 00:52.661
[female voice] In 1600,

00:53.227 --> 00:55.055
the East India Company
was set up by Royal Charter

00:55.098 --> 00:56.839
to pursue trade with India.

01:00.190 --> 01:03.367
They traded in many goods:
spices, textiles,

01:03.411 --> 01:05.282
tea, cotton, salt, indigo...

01:05.325 --> 01:07.023
[chuckles]
...and, of course, opium,

01:07.067 --> 01:08.590
on the Calcutta Stock Exchange.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.028
But that's a story
for another time.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.379
[horse whinnies]

01:16.032 --> 01:18.513
I was born more than 200 years later

01:18.556 --> 01:20.341
on the banks of the Ganges.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.518
[horse whinnies]

01:25.259 --> 01:27.174
By then, the company
had expanded

01:27.217 --> 01:29.567
from trading into conquest

01:29.611 --> 01:30.960
using its private army

01:31.003 --> 01:33.397
to dethrone more and more
of India's rulers.

01:33.441 --> 01:34.877

-[horse whinnies]

01:37.184 --> 01:38.750
[horse grunts]

01:42.711 --> 01:44.147
Despite being a commoner,

01:44.626 --> 01:47.324
I spent my childhood
in the court of the Marathas,

01:47.846 --> 01:49.674
raised by my father.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.286
Here, hold.

01:53.069 --> 01:55.550
By the time I was married  to the Maharaja of Jhansi,

01:55.593 --> 01:57.508
at the mature age of 15...

01:57.856 --> 02:00.207
[chanting]

02:01.164 --> 02:02.209
...many rulers knew

02:02.644 --> 02:04.472
that the company had
overstayed their welcome.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.952
[in Hindi]

02:11.609 --> 02:12.828
I was one of them.

02:13.959 --> 02:16.136
[cheering and applause]

02:17.615 --> 02:19.269
A baby was on the way.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.576
[in Hindi]

02:33.588 --> 02:35.242
[screams]

02:35.633 --> 02:37.200
And we were blessed

02:37.244 --> 02:38.767
-with a boy.

[elephant trumpets]

03:12.279 --> 03:13.932
[trumpets]

03:17.893 --> 03:19.808
[Rani] But our joy
was short-lived,

03:20.156 --> 03:22.550
and a gloom
descended over Jhansi.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.336
[in Marathi]

03:28.817 --> 03:31.341
We had to secure
the future of our kingdom.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.082
We adopted our nephew

03:33.125 --> 03:35.127
to be our son
and heir to the throne.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.827
We thought our hardships were
over and we could stand united

03:38.870 --> 03:40.655
against the East India Company.

03:40.698 --> 03:44.180
I hereby declare Anand Rao
has been adopted.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.965
His name
will now be Damodar Rao.

03:47.227 --> 03:51.448
But little did we know,
this was just the beginning.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.282
Careful with that. That's it.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.371
Move.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.156
Steady.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.249
That's it. On there.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.481

05:43.038 --> 05:46.346
Kill me if you must,
but please...

05:46.824 --> 05:48.391
-Alexander!
-Please leave my family alone!

05:48.913 --> 05:49.958
Please.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.477
[woman] Poor Captain Scene.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.394
His whole family slaughtered
like animals.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.048
What a terrible, terrible thing.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.094
Your Majesty, regretfully,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.402
a great number
of British subjects

06:42.445 --> 06:44.665
have now perished
in this revolt.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.667
And a great number
of Indians too.

06:48.059 --> 06:50.627
You are quite correct, Salem.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.108
This mutiny
must come to an end

06:53.413 --> 06:56.111
as quickly as possible
for the sake of both sides.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.157
I do wish we could have

06:59.201 --> 07:01.769
this conversation
in private, Ma'am.

07:01.812 --> 07:05.425
Anything you have to say,
I am happy for Salem to hear.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.252
[sighs]

07:07.775 --> 07:09.429
After all, he is from India

07:10.255 --> 07:13.041
and I value his opinion
in these matters.

07:14.608 --> 07:18.699
Well, the, uh, situation
has taken a bizarre,

07:18.742 --> 07:20.962
even farcical turn.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.834
"Chapati movement
mystery deepens."

07:25.183 --> 07:26.576
Unleavened bread, Ma'am.

07:26.620 --> 07:30.101
[man] We've no idea
where this practice originated

07:30.145 --> 07:31.581
or for what purpose.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.497
We suspect it's some sort of

07:34.541 --> 07:36.934
underground movement
against the company.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.588
They're advancing across Agra

07:38.632 --> 07:40.634
at a rate, somewhere between
100 and...

07:41.939 --> 07:43.637
200 miles a night.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.900
Which is
particularly disconcerting

07:46.944 --> 07:49.643
as it's rather a lot faster
than the Royal Mail.

07:49.686 --> 07:50.861
[stifled chuckle]

07:51.601 --> 07:57.520
They say lotus flowers
and bits of goat's flesh

07:57.564 --> 07:59.609
are being passed
from hand to hand

07:59.653 --> 08:02.525
and the words
"Everything has become red"

08:02.569 --> 08:04.440
are being whispered everywhere.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.051
[translates in Hindi]

08:07.443 --> 08:08.792
Well, whatever
its meaning, Ma'am,

08:08.836 --> 08:11.882
all this hocus-pocus
is spooking our men.

08:11.926 --> 08:15.059
Seems to have spooked you
as well, Prime Minister.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.192
I'm aware of it, that's all.

08:17.235 --> 08:22.153
These archaic customs
are hampering our efforts

08:22.197 --> 08:23.851
to civilize these people.

08:23.894 --> 08:27.245
The whole affair
suggests this mutiny is about

08:27.289 --> 08:31.423
much more than the unhappiness
of a few regiments of sepoys

08:31.467 --> 08:33.207
and that the East India Company

08:33.251 --> 08:36.515
is more disliked
than we were led to believe.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.735
We have faced these difficulties

08:38.779 --> 08:40.868
in other colonies, Ma'am.

08:40.910 --> 08:42.477
What's happening in Jhansi?

08:43.479 --> 08:44.915
Is that young queen
still refusing

08:44.959 --> 08:46.395
to submit to company rule?

08:46.438 --> 08:47.744
Yes, she is.

08:48.092 --> 08:51.792
The Central Indian Field Force
is marching to Jhansi now.

08:51.835 --> 08:54.925
Seems a rather dangerous time
to be opening other fronts.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.406
Oh, Sir Hugh Rose has
everything well in hand.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.451
In the past few days,
his men have captured

08:59.495 --> 09:02.106
more than 18 rebel forts.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.282
Does he think
she will surrender?

09:05.240 --> 09:06.720
[prime minister]
She will have to.

09:06.763 --> 09:07.938
She has no army.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.201
Her neighbors are all in revolt.

09:10.245 --> 09:13.944
We must seize Jhansi before
she decides to join them.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.467
[Salem]
Doesn't attacking an ally

09:16.033 --> 09:18.209
risk pushing her into the arms
of your enemies?

09:19.036 --> 09:20.734
If she will not surrender,

09:21.865 --> 09:23.954
Jhansi will
have to be destroyed.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.521
[prays softly in Urdu]

09:25.565 --> 09:28.393
[Queen] I fear if
cooler heads do not prevail,

09:29.177 --> 09:32.572
the East India Company will
tarnish not just its own name,

09:33.660 --> 09:36.227
but that of
the entire British Empire.

09:52.548 --> 09:55.986
[Rani] Dear Ellis, my
Jhansi is beyond recognition.

09:57.161 --> 09:59.990
As I foresaw,
the ground is turning red

10:00.034 --> 10:01.731
with the blood of innocents.

10:03.385 --> 10:04.865
Our army was in the north

10:04.908 --> 10:06.823
trying to defend the kingdoms
from rivals

10:06.867 --> 10:08.738
-when the mutineers struck.
-[banging on door]

10:08.782 --> 10:11.523
I was helpless to prevent
violence against the British

10:11.567 --> 10:13.351
who have made Jhansi
their home.

10:13.395 --> 10:15.049

10:15.353 --> 10:16.746

10:41.815 --> 10:43.904
[child crying]

10:49.823 --> 10:51.520
[Rani]
I've written to Sir Hamilton

10:51.563 --> 10:52.782
of the East India Company

10:53.261 --> 10:55.655
to suggest we work together
to challenge the mutineers,

10:56.786 --> 10:59.006
but my letters
have gone unanswered.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.966
This rebellion
threatens Jhansi,

11:03.010 --> 11:05.708
my people and all I hold dear.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.712
If you have any wise counsel,
I would gladly hear it.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.152
Dear Sir Hamilton,

11:15.196 --> 11:16.850
I write to you with
a matter of great urgency.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.982
I will not be able to protect
the residents of Jhansi,

11:19.026 --> 11:20.941
including the families of
the East India Company...

11:20.984 --> 11:22.638
Please convey my message
to Lord Dalhousie.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.248
...unless I am given
military support.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.772
My own life is threatened.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.948
I'm not sure
how long I can hold them off.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.558
If we do nothing,
we will all lose.

11:29.601 --> 11:30.472
Send help.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.041
[chuckles]

11:36.086 --> 11:37.653
[man] This is preposterous.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.743
This damned mutiny
is completely out of hand!

11:40.787 --> 11:41.962
Hear, hear.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.703
It was a simple oversight.

11:43.746 --> 11:47.184
No-one meant to offend
the Hindus and Muslims.

11:47.228 --> 11:50.361
We've removed
the offending cartridges.

11:50.405 --> 11:53.451
Well, there's no pig fat
or cow fat anywhere near them.

11:53.495 --> 11:56.237
Intentional or not,
they have taken great offense,

11:56.280 --> 11:59.283
and the unrest continues
to spread like wildfire.

11:59.327 --> 12:02.373
It has adversely affected
the local economy.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.375
Tax revenues are down.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.638
And if they don't rise soon,

12:06.682 --> 12:10.077
we could see a serious decline
in share price.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.427
Perhaps even a run
on the stock!

12:12.470 --> 12:14.516
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
let's keep calm.

12:15.865 --> 12:19.260
We've succeeded in the past by
keeping the Indians divided.

12:19.956 --> 12:22.785
We must simply do it again.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.701
-Hear hear.
-Quite right.

Highly contagious.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.448
The mortality rate is over--

14:44.492 --> 14:46.407
I understand
all about cholera, damn it!

14:46.886 --> 14:49.497
Sir, there's also sunstroke
and exhaustion.

14:50.454 --> 14:51.586
-The heat...
-Don't talk to me

14:51.629 --> 14:52.717
about the heat, sir!

14:53.066 --> 14:55.068
All everybody talks about
is the bloody weather!

14:58.419 --> 14:59.420
How bad is it?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.770
Three quarters of the brigades
are under strength,

15:01.813 --> 15:03.728
and a quarter
are combat ineffective.

15:04.686 --> 15:05.687
If we press on?

15:06.731 --> 15:08.472
We could lose
those still standing.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.083
We must hold the march.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.346
Surely, they need time
to recover.

-Well, most of them.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.616
Do you really think
you can train these women to

16:05.660 --> 16:06.748
fight like men?

16:08.054 --> 16:08.924
No.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.058
I will train them
to fight better than men.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.017
Nana Sahib...

16:16.323 --> 16:17.715
can I count on your support?

16:18.281 --> 16:20.022
When the time comes,
we will be there.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.653
[people crying]

20:29.315 --> 20:30.925
[in Hindi]

20:45.722 --> 20:47.028
[murmuring]

21:08.615 --> 21:10.181
[indistinct arguing]

21:33.553 --> 21:35.511
[in Marathi]

21:37.731 --> 21:38.645
[chuckles]

21:39.733 --> 21:41.691
[in English]
You are now a prince.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.171
What does that mean?

21:44.520 --> 21:47.262
[Rani] It means
you must always be just,

21:48.350 --> 21:51.353
kind and an example
to your people.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.703
[man] I must speak
to the Rani. Let me through.

21:53.747 --> 21:54.617
[in Hindi]

21:55.618 --> 21:56.793
Rani Saheb...

21:57.446 --> 21:58.621
[greets in Hindi]

22:00.971 --> 22:04.235
It is with deep regret
that I must inform you

22:04.279 --> 22:06.760
that under Lord Dalhousie's
Doctrine of Lapse,

22:08.109 --> 22:10.416
the East India Company
hereby renounces

22:10.459 --> 22:12.809
the legitimacy of
heir apparent Damodar Rao.

22:12.853 --> 22:13.941
[swords unsheathe]

22:15.551 --> 22:17.553
With no legal male heir,

22:18.249 --> 22:21.644
the company will proceed
with the annexation of Jhansi.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.910
I am merely a messenger.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.392
[all murmuring]

22:43.666 --> 22:45.320
[indistinct arguing]

22:58.507 --> 23:00.509
[call to prayer in distance]

23:11.433 --> 23:14.088
What has happened to
the sanctity of the word?

23:14.958 --> 23:16.830
The purity of trust?

23:17.134 --> 23:19.223
I pleaded your case
as best I could.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.183
The Governor General would not
be moved on the matter.

23:22.226 --> 23:24.272
The British gifted Jhansi
to my husband's family

23:24.533 --> 23:26.230
over 100 years ago.

23:27.362 --> 23:29.320
He was a loyal ally and friendto the company

23:29.364 --> 23:31.018
until the day he died.

23:34.630 --> 23:35.849
I cannot fail him.

23:36.763 --> 23:37.677
You won't.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.157
Then help me understand.

23:43.639 --> 23:44.988
Profits aren't
what they used to be.

23:46.642 --> 23:49.253
And annexing the kingdom will
provide much needed revenue.

23:49.297 --> 23:51.517
They seized the throne
from my son,

23:52.692 --> 23:54.607
forced us
out of the main palace,

23:57.000 --> 23:58.611
and once again,
our neighboring kingdoms

23:58.654 --> 24:00.830
of Orchha and Datya
are plotting against us.

24:02.789 --> 24:04.399
Without a title, I have no army

24:04.443 --> 24:06.140
with which to defend my people.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.534
When sorrows come,
they come not single spies,

24:08.577 --> 24:09.578
but in battalia.

24:10.274 --> 24:11.406
-Ham--
-Hamlet.

24:11.972 --> 24:14.278
[chuckles] Of course you knew.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.239
We can approach another lawyer

24:18.282 --> 24:21.068
and continue to pursue your
claim in court, but for now...

24:23.157 --> 24:24.985
you must assume
you are on your own.

24:39.129 --> 24:40.479
[in Marathi]

24:41.915 --> 24:43.612
[in English]
It is so good to see you

24:43.656 --> 24:45.005
dressed like the queen
that you are

24:45.048 --> 24:46.528
rather than in your male attire.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.575
[in Marathi]

25:02.588 --> 25:04.590
[in English] She thinks
the way forward is to fight.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.287
I think she should be patient.

25:07.418 --> 25:10.770
Unfortunately, she does not
have the luxury of time.

25:11.248 --> 25:13.381
But violence leads only one way,

25:13.424 --> 25:15.078
to anger and more violence.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.080
Maybe her father should remember

25:17.124 --> 25:19.692
who gave her a bow and arrow,
rather than a doll.

25:20.214 --> 25:22.216
[in Marathi]

25:40.016 --> 25:42.105
[in English] The British
have not yet arrived.

25:44.020 --> 25:45.587
Do not meet threat with threat.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.023
Look to have a dialogue.

25:48.242 --> 25:50.244
They are merely gathering
their strength.

25:51.332 --> 25:52.899
As soon as they are able,

25:54.161 --> 25:55.162
they will attack.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.730
But we have lost too many men
in Datya and Orchha

25:57.773 --> 25:59.383
to compete
with their military strength.

25:59.427 --> 26:00.994
Who said anything about men?

26:05.651 --> 26:08.088
If the British
are too weak to fight,

26:08.131 --> 26:09.480
perhaps they will listen.

26:09.524 --> 26:11.700
When have they ever shown
that they can listen?

26:11.744 --> 26:13.920
-Calm down.
-Have you ever had any success

26:13.963 --> 26:16.052
telling an angry woman
to calm down?

26:16.096 --> 26:17.445
[in Marathi]

26:52.349 --> 26:54.351
[Hamilton] I don't understand
why that bloody heathen

26:54.395 --> 26:55.831
insists on carrying on
with this farce.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.267
[man] What do you expect, sir?

26:57.311 --> 26:59.008
Would you give up your kingdom
without a fight?

26:59.052 --> 27:00.227
The bottom line is

27:00.270 --> 27:01.750
the company wants her head
on a platter,

27:01.794 --> 27:03.143
and it's our job to deliver it.

27:03.186 --> 27:05.841
[scoffs] Have you seen the men?

27:05.885 --> 27:07.887
We simply don't have
the strength to press on.

27:07.930 --> 27:10.541
We must try to reason with her.

27:10.585 --> 27:11.891
You can't reason
with that Jezebel!

27:11.934 --> 27:12.892
If she surrenders,

27:13.283 --> 27:15.068
it will save a good deal
of blood on both sides.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.983
She will never surrender.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.638
She needs to be broken
and destroyed!

27:21.161 --> 27:24.468
I'm thinking of asking Ellis
to return.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.253
You can't be serious.

27:27.297 --> 27:28.690
Why bring in a man
whose loyalties

27:28.734 --> 27:30.561
are questionable at best?

27:30.605 --> 27:32.738
-He could be a great help.
-To which side?

27:33.303 --> 27:35.262
You have no idea
what a storm he kicked up

27:35.305 --> 27:37.830
-over the Doctrine of Lapse.
-Oh, that was four years ago.

27:39.309 --> 27:41.964
A lot of water
under the bridge since then.

27:43.574 --> 27:47.535
Let's use him while the men
regain their strength.

27:48.841 --> 27:50.407
If the negotiations fail,

27:51.495 --> 27:52.583
then we'll attack.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.586
We have nothing to lose
by talking.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.240
Except our self-respect.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.941
Negotiating with these rebelswill only encourage others.

28:05.074 --> 28:05.988
Rani Saheb.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.296
[in Hindi]

28:13.996 --> 28:15.606
They've been
stopped in their tracks

28:15.650 --> 28:16.695
by an outbreak of cholera.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.653
While they lie in their beds,

28:18.697 --> 28:20.046
we shall strengthen
our defenses.

28:20.089 --> 28:21.787
The British
have their own spies.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.920
Last night, someone spiked
several of our cannons.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.270
How many?

28:28.010 --> 28:28.924
A dozen.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.320
And the saboteurs may return
to finish the rest.

28:34.321 --> 28:35.975
[in Hindi]

28:39.326 --> 28:40.762
Double the guard this evening.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.895
[in Hindi]

28:44.679 --> 28:45.985
And, Rani Saheb,

28:47.160 --> 28:49.162
we must also be watchful
of our inner circle.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.774
Our movements
have been intercepted

28:52.818 --> 28:53.993
far too many times.

28:57.257 --> 28:58.171
Thank you.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.001
-That will be all.
-[in Hindi] Yes.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.225
What do you think?

29:10.096 --> 29:12.533
Is it true
I'm no longer a prince?

29:15.014 --> 29:17.538
Of course not!
Who told you that?

29:18.017 --> 29:20.541
Because I'm not really your son.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.673
So I'm not really a prince?

29:27.635 --> 29:29.724
Just because we do not have
the same blood

29:29.768 --> 29:31.813
does not mean you are not mine.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.295
Remember what I told you?

29:36.078 --> 29:38.428
-What makes a prince?
-My actions.

29:38.472 --> 29:39.560
That's right.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.432
We must both be brave.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.522
For each other,
and for our people.

29:48.874 --> 29:49.962
I love you.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.703
Your father loved you.

29:54.183 --> 29:55.445
Never forget that.

29:57.273 --> 29:59.145
And no matter what anyone says,

29:59.188 --> 30:00.799
you are a prince.

30:02.235 --> 30:04.411
And you are my son.

30:13.289 --> 30:16.249
-[horse whinnies]
-[men chattering]

30:20.731 --> 30:22.429
Uh, Corporal Meiklejohn,
isn't it?

30:22.472 --> 30:23.343
Yes, sir.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.868
-Writing home?
-To my mother, sir.

30:27.173 --> 30:28.391
Oh, do you mind if I...

30:28.435 --> 30:29.958
-Of course, sir.
-Thank you.

30:30.829 --> 30:31.873
"Dear Mother,

30:31.917 --> 30:33.701
I feel certain
that I shall be...

30:34.789 --> 30:35.964
killed in the storm to come."

30:39.925 --> 30:41.665
Well, you will
with that attitude, won't you?

30:42.884 --> 30:44.494
You're here to lead men.

30:44.799 --> 30:46.453
Don't you dare
let them see that!

30:49.412 --> 30:51.153
Good God, man,
where's your courage?

30:53.503 --> 30:54.983
[drums playing]

31:02.425 --> 31:03.905
[song playing]

31:26.101 --> 31:26.972
Rani Saheb.

31:32.368 --> 31:34.370
[in Marathi]

31:39.941 --> 31:41.334
[Rani in Marathi]

32:03.443 --> 32:06.141
[soldiers] â™ª We were
marching down the street â™ª

32:06.185 --> 32:08.752
â™ª We heard the people say

32:08.796 --> 32:10.754
[Hamilton] Isn't there a part
of you that wants to

32:10.798 --> 32:12.539
fight and defeat her
on the field of battle?

32:12.800 --> 32:14.410
Glory's an illusion, sir.

32:15.281 --> 32:18.458
Veils the horrors of bloodshed
and death. No.

32:19.328 --> 32:21.069
As a shareholder I can tell you,

32:21.113 --> 32:23.289
the mood inside the company
is bloody.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.595
They will not permit the stock
to plummet any further.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.510
Oh, you're a shareholder,
are you?

32:27.771 --> 32:28.903
Sixth generation.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.210
And we will protect
our interests.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.951
Our interests, sir.

32:33.212 --> 32:37.433
Where? Kanpur,
Lucknow, Delhi. [scoffs]

32:39.000 --> 32:41.960
Never forget Kabul, sir.
The bloody retreat.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.701
We thought we had them licked

32:45.920 --> 32:48.140
yet only one man survived.

32:48.531 --> 32:49.489
What's your point?

32:50.272 --> 32:52.709
My point is, sir, don't preen.

32:52.753 --> 32:55.712
Don't underestimate the enemy.
Even if she is a woman.

32:56.409 --> 32:58.150
She's fought many battles
against her neighbors

32:58.193 --> 33:00.152
-and never been defeated.
-[man] Am I interrupting?

33:00.195 --> 33:01.457
-Ah, Ellis.
-Sir.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.199
Good to see you. Take a pew.

33:04.765 --> 33:08.029
Uh, to business then.
We're talking about the Rani.

33:09.204 --> 33:12.251
We don't have the forces to
succeed in a direct assault.

33:12.294 --> 33:13.774
[grunts]
And our mere presence here

33:13.817 --> 33:16.298
may lead her
to ally with the rebels.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.692
We need a peaceful settlement
and we need it now.

33:18.735 --> 33:20.607
She has the blood of
Captain Scene on her hands.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.652
It was Skene's own troops
that mutinied against him.

33:22.696 --> 33:25.177
Oh, don't be so bloody daft!
She incited them.

33:25.220 --> 33:26.743
[Ellis] She has always been
a loyal ally,

33:26.787 --> 33:28.745
and the mutineers threatened
to blow up her palace.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.356
She wrote to you
and asked for assistance

33:30.399 --> 33:32.227
which under the Treaty
you signed,

33:32.271 --> 33:34.577
you were duty-bound to
provide, and you did nothing.

33:34.621 --> 33:35.970
Is this true, Robert?

33:36.014 --> 33:37.493
His imagination's running wild.

33:37.798 --> 33:40.061
You seem to believe yourself
in some sort of fairytale

33:40.409 --> 33:42.759
where your precious queen islooking for a villain to blame.

33:42.803 --> 33:44.805
Your treachery is no fairytale.

33:44.848 --> 33:47.068
This wasn't even your first
breach of trust with Jhansi.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.461
You witnessed
Damodar's adoption!

33:52.639 --> 33:54.945
[man chanting in Hindi]

34:01.561 --> 34:03.824
Told you. He's obsessed
with the Doctrine of Lapse.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.086
Oh, enough, gentlemen!

34:06.000 --> 34:07.349
This bickering
will get us nowhere,

34:07.393 --> 34:08.568
whether she's guilty or not.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.744
Is a rather
important question, sir.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.659
We owe
these vulgar natives nothing.

34:14.661 --> 34:16.097
They're barbarians.

34:16.445 --> 34:17.793
[Ellis] After all these years,

34:18.404 --> 34:20.449
you still denigrate this land,

34:20.493 --> 34:22.277
its people and customs.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.628
Just try to talk to her, hmm?

34:25.672 --> 34:28.239
Convince her
that violence is not the way.

34:28.283 --> 34:31.330
Otherwise, I fear the cost to
both sides will be staggering.

34:32.025 --> 34:33.027
At once, sir.

34:36.987 --> 34:38.293
You need another drink.

34:38.815 --> 34:39.686
Mmm.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.388
[birds chirping]

34:49.609 --> 34:51.610

35:00.533 --> 35:02.578

35:02.622 --> 35:03.884
[all chuckle]

35:08.715 --> 35:10.195
[in Hindi]

35:16.026 --> 35:17.593
[in English] I want you
to always look

35:17.637 --> 35:19.334
-and smell beautiful.
-[shouting in distance]

35:19.378 --> 35:21.684
That way heads will turn
before they roll.

35:21.728 --> 35:22.990
[all laugh]

35:28.213 --> 35:29.692
It means so much to me

35:30.563 --> 35:32.652
that I'm allowed to dress you
with the others.

35:33.653 --> 35:34.958
You're like my sister.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.136
I know your true value,
Jhalkari Bai.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.139
You may be a Dalit,

35:41.791 --> 35:44.142
but the word "untouchable"
means nothing to me.

35:47.928 --> 35:51.018
We are not so different,
you and I.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.327
We could not be more different.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.503
You are royalty.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.201
I am nothing.

36:01.071 --> 36:02.508
It's the way of the world.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.555
It does not have to be.

36:06.599 --> 36:07.948
[in Hindi]

36:21.048 --> 36:22.354
[gasping]

36:23.964 --> 36:26.749
I did not know the British werestill able to show respect.

36:28.403 --> 36:30.971
Some of us
have always shown respect.

36:33.887 --> 36:36.194
It has been four years
since I last saw you.

36:38.108 --> 36:39.327
Much has happened since.

36:39.371 --> 36:40.720
You trusted me then,

36:42.939 --> 36:44.114
you can trust me now.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.515
There is someone
who wants to see you.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.699
-Look who we have here.
-[both laugh]

37:04.134 --> 37:05.310
Hello, Badal.

37:06.746 --> 37:07.703
Hello.

37:09.444 --> 37:10.663
Do you remember me?

37:18.584 --> 37:20.586
You remember
how to bless his food.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.980
Now more than ever,
we must ward off evil spirits.

37:26.548 --> 37:28.594
[Rani] I would be lost
without my Badal.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.292
When we ride,

37:32.554 --> 37:33.729
we ride as one.

37:34.904 --> 37:36.602
[Ellis] Rose wants you
to end your allegiance

37:36.645 --> 37:38.081
to Tatya Tope and Nana Sahib

37:38.430 --> 37:40.823
and turn over the province
to company control.

37:42.172 --> 37:43.870
Why would I do such a thing?

37:45.350 --> 37:46.916
To avoid further bloodshed.

37:49.136 --> 37:52.444
So when we refuse,
we will be attacked?

37:53.619 --> 37:54.620
"When"?

37:57.536 --> 37:58.841
My decision is made.

38:01.757 --> 38:03.106
Then yes, he will attack.

38:04.673 --> 38:07.110
Then you may tell him I will
see him on the battlefield.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.331
Rani Saheb,
their men may be depleted,

38:10.375 --> 38:11.724
but they are still
very powerful.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.943
They have captured
18 rebel forts already.

38:14.553 --> 38:17.295
I would remind you
I am no stranger to battle.

38:18.165 --> 38:20.080
I have led armies
into combat before,

38:20.123 --> 38:22.082
and I will do it again
if Jhansi is threatened.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.257
With all due respect,

38:23.605 --> 38:25.738
fighting a few hundred men
from Orchha and Datya

38:25.781 --> 38:27.740
is not the same
as fighting the British Army!

38:27.783 --> 38:29.176
You cannot withstand
the firepower

38:29.219 --> 38:30.264
they will bring to bear!

38:30.743 --> 38:33.049
Do not presume to tell me
what I can and cannot do!

38:37.445 --> 38:38.707
I apologize.

38:40.579 --> 38:42.494
And I did not mean
to speak out of turn.

38:42.537 --> 38:46.149
I simply... fear for Jhansi.

38:48.630 --> 38:49.544
And for you.

38:50.763 --> 38:52.547
I appreciate your concern,

38:54.462 --> 38:56.725
but I must do
what is best for my people,

38:58.118 --> 39:00.294
as your Queen must do
what's best for hers.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.209
I would never stand
in the way of that.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.908
Then we will fight
for what is ours.

39:07.954 --> 39:09.347
And we will win.

39:13.873 --> 39:15.353
[Hamilton] I bloody knew it!

39:15.614 --> 39:17.311
[Rose] Did you reason with her?

39:17.355 --> 39:18.791
You can't reason
with these people.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.183
Her least of all.

39:20.619 --> 39:23.099
[Rose sighs] Well, we tried.

39:23.883 --> 39:25.841
Now we will do what we must.

39:26.276 --> 39:27.713
I'm gonna go
and rally the troops.

39:28.670 --> 39:30.019
What's left of them.

39:32.326 --> 39:37.200
Promise me, whatever happens,
the Rani will be taken alive.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.028
Her and her father
must be treated

39:39.072 --> 39:41.335
with dignity and respect.

39:42.205 --> 39:44.817
She really wouldn't surrender
to save herself?

39:45.818 --> 39:47.167
Doesn't she want to live?

39:48.734 --> 39:50.300
This isn't about what she wants.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.912
That's what
you've never understood.

39:54.174 --> 39:58.570
She's at one with her country
and the people of Jhansi.

39:59.309 --> 40:00.702
[indistinct chatter]

40:02.617 --> 40:03.923
[in Hindi]

40:14.455 --> 40:15.804
[in English] Chapatis again!

40:16.283 --> 40:18.546
[Rani] Have I ever told you
about Prince Arjuna?

40:19.025 --> 40:20.069
[Damodar] No.

40:20.722 --> 40:23.812
[Rani] Let me tell you a taleof another warrior prince

40:23.856 --> 40:26.119
from a very long time ago.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.516
What will I learn
from this one?

40:32.734 --> 40:35.520
Stories rarely teach us
one single truth.

40:37.522 --> 40:40.873
Arjuna was leading his army
in a great civil war

40:40.916 --> 40:43.702
against those
who unjustly took his kingdom.

40:44.703 --> 40:46.835
On the eve of the final battle,

40:46.879 --> 40:48.446
he rode out
to survey his enemy.

40:48.968 --> 40:51.884
And there, in the middle
of the battlefield,

40:51.927 --> 40:56.018
were his friends,
relatives and teachers.

40:56.932 --> 40:59.544
Arjuna said he could not
oppose his loved ones,

41:00.458 --> 41:03.635
but Krishna told him he must.

41:04.244 --> 41:06.289
Arjuna was faced
with a dilemma:

41:07.116 --> 41:10.163
fight the war
or go against his duty.

41:11.033 --> 41:13.819
Of course,
Arjuna shouldn't fight.

41:13.862 --> 41:15.908
You cannot
kill the people you love.

41:16.256 --> 41:18.171
Krishna told Arjuna,

41:18.737 --> 41:21.304
"Do not think
of the spoils of battle.

41:21.609 --> 41:23.437
Of what you might win or lose.

41:23.916 --> 41:25.700
Fight with a clean heart

41:25.744 --> 41:27.702
and let your enemy
count his cost."

41:28.094 --> 41:31.401
But then,
everyone he loved would die?

41:32.794 --> 41:34.317
There is a lesson to this.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.277
Life is impermanent.

41:38.931 --> 41:41.237
We do not always
feel strong, Damodar.

41:42.325 --> 41:44.458
But we must
always follow our duty.

41:45.111 --> 41:48.114
I'm feeling scared, Aai Saheb.
Aren't you?

41:49.768 --> 41:51.509
Of course I am, little one.

41:52.727 --> 41:56.339
But a wise king once told me
not to fight my fear,

41:57.079 --> 41:58.907
to listen to it instead.

42:01.170 --> 42:02.650
[indistinct conversation]

42:03.782 --> 42:05.218
Look what I found. Hmm!

42:06.001 --> 42:07.133
[Ellis] Some snacks?

42:07.176 --> 42:08.569
[Hamilton]
Secret bloody messages!

42:08.613 --> 42:10.092
Will you please
stop shouting, sir?

42:10.136 --> 42:12.138
[Hamilton] Captain Taylor
found them amongst chapatis

42:12.181 --> 42:13.835
they've been spreading
all over the country.

42:13.879 --> 42:16.185
I tell you, these Indians
are sneaky little bastards.

42:19.188 --> 42:21.539
[Rose] Oh, it's in Hindi
or Marathi.

42:21.843 --> 42:23.236
One of those dialects.

42:24.846 --> 42:27.022
[reads in Hindi]

42:27.980 --> 42:29.024
[Rose] Well?

42:29.808 --> 42:31.418
"The sun will set
early tomorrow."

42:35.161 --> 42:37.729
-What does that mean?
-It means, sir,

42:37.772 --> 42:40.340
that we've lost
the element of surprise.

42:40.775 --> 42:42.734
Call off the attack.
An assault against

42:42.777 --> 42:44.779
well-defended walls is suicide.

42:45.301 --> 42:46.302
Nonsense.

42:50.219 --> 42:51.873
[bells ringing]

43:10.718 --> 43:12.459
[in Hindi]

43:16.594 --> 43:19.335
I received a telegram
from Sir Hugh Rose.

43:19.379 --> 43:20.772
They're going
to begin their attack

43:20.815 --> 43:22.469
on the Jhansi Fort this evening.

43:24.340 --> 43:27.953
But, Ma'am, Hindu custom says
you cannot fight at night.

43:28.606 --> 43:29.607
[sighs]

43:31.086 --> 43:33.393
-Oh, why ever not?
-It is taboo.

43:33.436 --> 43:36.396
And this superstitious nonsense

43:36.439 --> 43:39.225
is exactly why
the civilizing presence

43:39.268 --> 43:42.054
of the East India Company
is so vital.

43:42.881 --> 43:44.839
It's time to leave these

43:45.405 --> 43:47.842
ancient traditions in the past.

43:47.886 --> 43:49.757
[prays softly in Urdu]

43:52.412 --> 43:53.674
Why does he keep doing that?

43:53.718 --> 43:56.329
I would assume
he is praying for his family.

43:57.025 --> 43:58.984
They are also from Jhansi.

44:00.725 --> 44:03.075
It's most unfortunate
that it's come to this.

44:03.118 --> 44:04.990
If the people there
had been more reasonable,

44:05.033 --> 44:07.470
perhaps bloodshed
could have been avoided.

44:07.732 --> 44:08.689
As it is--

44:08.733 --> 44:10.909
I want no excessive bloodshed!

44:13.346 --> 44:15.696
The East India Company
have already done

44:15.740 --> 44:18.177
incalculable damage
to British interests

44:18.220 --> 44:19.831
with their heavy hand!

44:19.874 --> 44:23.182
I've told Sir Hugh Rose
to keep it within limits.

44:23.225 --> 44:25.097
No more than
is strictly necessary.

44:25.793 --> 44:29.144
How do you judge
what is "strictly necessary"?

44:30.058 --> 44:32.539
I thought you Hindus
believed in non-violence?

44:32.582 --> 44:35.716
Isn't the killing of a mere
ant supposed to be sacrilege?

44:35.760 --> 44:37.370
I am Muslim, sir.

44:38.676 --> 44:42.157
Oh, right. Well,
the question still stands.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.421
All world religions urge peace.

44:46.335 --> 44:48.947
The sooner the lot of you
are converted to Christianity,

44:48.990 --> 44:50.818
the sooner we can
all live in peace.

44:51.340 --> 44:54.039
Religion may have provided
the spark, Prime Minister,

44:54.082 --> 44:56.476
but this mutiny is about
much more than that.

44:58.304 --> 45:01.960
The company's zeal for profit
has no doubt played a role.

45:02.438 --> 45:05.572
The East India Company
is the greatest corporation

45:05.615 --> 45:07.661
in the history of the world,

45:08.314 --> 45:11.491
and it does not need me
to defend its good name.

45:12.405 --> 45:16.278
I want to hear the news from
Jhansi as soon as it comes in.

45:17.976 --> 45:19.455
Of course, Your Majesty.

45:27.637 --> 45:31.467
My thoughts and prayers will
be with your family tonight.

45:31.859 --> 45:33.426
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-[door closes]

45:36.472 --> 45:37.735
Push those over to the left...

45:45.133 --> 45:47.092
[indistinct conversation]

46:12.465 --> 46:14.684
-Salaam,Rani Saheb.
-Wa alaykumu salam.

46:17.165 --> 46:18.950
You should get some sleep,
Rani Saheb.

46:20.821 --> 46:22.431
Jhansi does not sleep.

46:22.692 --> 46:23.868
So neither can I.

46:24.477 --> 46:26.087
How was your visit
to the temple?

46:26.131 --> 46:29.874
For a few hours, it felt like
nothing had changed.

46:34.661 --> 46:35.575
What is it?

46:40.101 --> 46:41.755
Let me lead the army tomorrow.

46:42.887 --> 46:44.714
We've never faced
these rifles before.

46:45.541 --> 46:47.282
And we need to assess
their impact.

46:49.110 --> 46:50.808
I trained this army

46:51.199 --> 46:52.897
and I will not
sit back and watch

46:52.940 --> 46:54.289
as they fight without me.

46:54.333 --> 46:55.551
Gone are those days

46:56.465 --> 46:57.989
when you could jump on a horse,

46:58.554 --> 47:01.035
brandish a sword,
and gallop on to battle.

47:03.298 --> 47:04.865
You must think
of your people now,

47:06.171 --> 47:07.215
and your son.

47:08.303 --> 47:10.784
Everything I do, I do for Jhansi

47:11.480 --> 47:12.830
and for my son.

47:13.308 --> 47:14.744
[in Hindi]

47:34.852 --> 47:35.983
[sighs]

47:40.422 --> 47:43.121
[Rani] "To do good to mankind
is the chivalrous plan,

47:43.425 --> 47:45.645
And is always as nobly requited,

47:46.472 --> 47:49.170
Then battle for freedom
wherever you can,

47:51.303 --> 47:54.523
And if not shot or hanged,
you'll get knighted."

you were meant to be,

48:06.927 --> 48:08.015
Rani of Jhansi.

48:10.931 --> 48:12.933
I would love
to see snow one day.

48:20.549 --> 48:21.550
[Ellis] Check.

48:23.988 --> 48:25.641
Perhaps this is my lucky day.

48:26.860 --> 48:27.905
At last.

48:29.645 --> 48:30.864
Sometimes

48:31.386 --> 48:33.475
a sacrifice is the only way out.

48:36.739 --> 48:37.871
Checkmate.

49:17.650 --> 49:19.217
[Hamilton]
The smell of the prey.

49:21.959 --> 49:24.091
The taste of blood
in the balmy air.

49:24.831 --> 49:26.659
Gives one a rush likenothing else, doesn't it?

49:26.702 --> 49:29.575
Have you ever killed a man,
watched him die?

49:30.837 --> 49:33.883
The hounds are baying,
Ellis. Hm?

49:35.537 --> 49:37.800
And our quarry
shall have no escape.

49:37.844 --> 49:38.888
[Rose] My dear Sir Robert,

49:38.932 --> 49:40.238
I hope you won't
be disappointed.

49:40.281 --> 49:42.022
A siege is not a chase.

49:42.066 --> 49:44.894
A siege is long days of
grinding drudgery and boredom.

49:45.286 --> 49:47.114
[Hamilton] Bah.
We defeated most of our allies

49:47.158 --> 49:48.550
on the road to Jhansi.

49:48.594 --> 49:50.509
Their walls
were less well fortified,

49:50.552 --> 49:52.728
nor were they
as well manned or provisioned.

49:52.772 --> 49:53.991
That's just defeatism.

49:54.034 --> 49:55.905
Furthermore,
the heat will mow us down

49:55.949 --> 49:57.733
as effectively as any fusillade.

50:50.569 --> 50:51.787
[Rose] Good shot.

50:51.831 --> 50:54.181
Sir, these men,
they need a break.

50:54.225 --> 50:56.662
They've been out here for hoursand the heat is relentless.

50:56.705 --> 50:58.055
Get back to your post,
Meiklejohn!

50:58.098 --> 51:00.144
If I hear one more soldier
talk about the heat,

51:00.187 --> 51:01.623
it'll be 30 days hard labor!

51:04.365 --> 51:06.193
-Back to your post, Corporal.
-Yes, sir.

51:06.628 --> 51:08.239

At least you tried, Corporal.

[CANNON FIRE CONTINUES]

51:45.754 --> 51:48.540
We can't keep up with this
bombardment much longer.

51:48.583 --> 51:50.455
We're running out
of powder and shot.

51:50.498 --> 51:51.978
Well, then let's stop
this charade

51:52.021 --> 51:53.936
-and launch the assault.
-At what cost, sir?

51:53.980 --> 51:55.721
Oh, damn the bloody cost, Rose!

51:55.764 --> 51:57.070
We look like fools out here!

51:57.114 --> 51:58.637
[man] Problem on the flank, sir!

51:58.680 --> 51:59.594
What's that?

52:06.166 --> 52:08.299
Cease fire. Cease fire!

we're being flanked!

Tatya Tope has arrived
with a relief army!

52:15.741 --> 52:17.003
Congratulations.

52:17.046 --> 52:19.353
You've finally managed
to unite the enemies!

52:19.832 --> 52:22.661
Now we can defeat two enemies
in one battle, can't we?

52:22.704 --> 52:24.489
Save us having to march
on Bithoor.

52:25.098 --> 52:27.187
Tell Company A and B
to join forces

52:27.231 --> 52:29.972
on our northern flank.
Prepare for attack.

52:30.016 --> 52:30.930

Rani Saheb, Tatya Tope's army

53:30.990 --> 53:33.514
sustained too many casualties
to continue the fight.

53:34.776 --> 53:37.779
And it is with great regret
he has ordered a retreat.

53:38.345 --> 53:39.912

53:41.740 --> 53:43.307
[in English]
If the fort should fall,

53:43.350 --> 53:46.701
he insists you should flee
and join him there.

53:47.267 --> 53:49.269

54:03.196 --> 54:05.633
We have lost our only hope
of breaking the siege.

54:09.289 --> 54:10.943
Gather my counselors
and my generals.

54:11.857 --> 54:12.858
At once.

54:13.598 --> 54:16.383
If any more provinces rise inrebellion and come to her aid,

54:16.427 --> 54:18.820
we risk being forced to fight
on two fronts again.

54:19.168 --> 54:20.909
We can't delay any longer, Rose!

54:23.651 --> 54:24.609
Very well.

54:25.305 --> 54:26.741
We'll wait till
the cover of darkness,

54:26.785 --> 54:27.916
then launch our attack.

54:28.787 --> 54:29.788
Rally the troops.

54:32.573 --> 54:34.445
[Hamilton chuckles]
You know, I was just thinking

54:34.488 --> 54:35.968
what a beautiful irony
it would be

54:36.011 --> 54:38.405
for her to be shot off her
horse with an Enfield rifle.

Spare the women and children.

59:06.412 --> 59:08.588
And burn every village
on the Grand Trunk Road.

Where is your harlot

understand you, sir.

59:44.668 --> 59:45.886
You need a translator.

59:45.930 --> 59:47.279
[Ellis] Unhand him!

59:47.322 --> 59:48.933
That's no way to get
answers from anyone!

59:48.976 --> 59:50.021
You heard him.

59:50.499 --> 59:52.371
He's a prisoner, not an animal.

-Assumed, didn't you?

01:00:08.735 --> 01:00:12.434
I assumed, sir,
that you were our friend.

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:15.133
-Take him away.
-Sir, it's the Rani!

01:00:15.176 --> 01:00:17.135
She's escaping
out the South Gate!

for you, sir?

01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:04.312
You can surrender.

01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:06.097
I only surrender to Ma Durga.

01:01:06.401 --> 01:01:08.665
Not to mere cowards and bullies.

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.797
[Ellis] You're not allowed
to touch her!

01:01:10.841 --> 01:01:13.321
I'm allowed to do
whatever I damn well want!

01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:19.632
And you'd do well
to remember that, Ellis.

01:01:25.812 --> 01:01:27.684
Ah, Hamilton,
a word please, sir.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.381
Yes, sir?

01:01:30.034 --> 01:01:32.471
You're only to threaten her.Nothing more. Understood?

01:01:32.514 --> 01:01:33.515
Of course.

01:01:34.212 --> 01:01:35.692
Only what's
"strictly necessary."

01:01:35.735 --> 01:01:37.824
Isn't that what the Queen,
Her Majesty, insisted upon?

01:01:41.523 --> 01:01:44.178
Your forces are defeated,
scattered to the winds.

01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:47.704

What's she saying?

01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:04.372
[Rose] For God's sake, man,
get over here!

01:02:04.416 --> 01:02:06.157
[Hamilton] She's trying
to curse us, Ellis!

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.245
No, she isn't!

is the only way out."

01:03:14.703 --> 01:03:16.140
You have no-one to blame
but yourself.

01:03:17.532 --> 01:03:18.577
What do you mean, Ellis?

01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:21.406
A decoy only works if you
can't tell two people apart.

01:03:21.449 --> 01:03:23.756
We must catch up with her
while we still have the time.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.757
Ellis, you're with me.

01:03:25.149 --> 01:03:26.803
Hamilton, you stay here
and sort out this mess.

01:03:28.717 --> 01:03:30.154

Taste it and remember
who your master is!

01:04:34.479 --> 01:04:36.611
We can use him with
the hounds, chasing foxes.

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:38.875
Sully our fine hounds
with a mongrel like this?

01:04:39.179 --> 01:04:40.615

01:07:51.328 --> 01:07:53.025
Unbelievable.

Our spies report that

01:07:55.462 --> 01:07:57.682
she's already made it
as far as Kalpi.

Ah, Hamilton, you return.
Good.

Just in time
to discuss our next step.

01:08:14.307 --> 01:08:16.527
Well, it shouldn't be too
difficult to route the rebels.

01:08:16.569 --> 01:08:17.962
We now have our own troops

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:20.835
from Bombay, Madras
and the Punjab residency.

fired a shot in his life.

01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:25.710
[Hamilton] You really
are pathetic, Ellis.

01:08:26.754 --> 01:08:30.279
Now, I think you're infatuated
by that woman.

01:08:31.455 --> 01:08:32.978
She's more than just a woman.

01:08:33.544 --> 01:08:34.545
She's an idea.

01:08:35.328 --> 01:08:37.939
And ideas cannot be captured
or owned.

01:08:38.853 --> 01:08:41.247
She belongs to her people,
not the East India Company!

01:08:43.075 --> 01:08:44.511
Why is he even still here?

01:08:45.163 --> 01:08:47.078
-We need a translator.
-[Hamilton scoffs]

01:08:51.736 --> 01:08:52.911
How's her father?

01:08:54.216 --> 01:08:56.305
Oh, I should think he's beingvery well looked after.

01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.917
You know, it's a shame
you're more concerned

01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:01.876
with the enemy
than your fellow countrymen.

01:09:05.402 --> 01:09:07.404
Ellis, sit down a moment,
would you?

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.014
Sir.

01:09:14.411 --> 01:09:16.282
If you come to Kalpi,

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.981
I need to know
what side you're on.

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:25.335
I serve England and the East
India Company, as always, sir.

01:09:25.377 --> 01:09:28.555
When she is captured or killed
in the field of battle,

01:09:29.513 --> 01:09:31.645
I expect you to do your duty.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.256
Understood?

01:09:36.084 --> 01:09:38.826
Gwalior has refused
to support us in the mutiny.

01:09:39.566 --> 01:09:42.002
And our men are beginning
to turn against each other.

01:09:42.613 --> 01:09:44.223
They are tired of defeat.

01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:48.095
We cannot keep fleeing
like a deer before a tiger.

01:09:48.444 --> 01:09:50.359
You are the only one
who has fled.

01:09:51.752 --> 01:09:54.189
How much more demoralized
would our armies be

01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:56.975
if I allowed the British
to capture and execute me?

01:09:57.018 --> 01:09:59.630
We lost over 3,000 men
on the banks of the Betwa.

01:09:59.673 --> 01:10:00.805
[Tatya] Nana Sahib.

01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:04.156
I was commanding the forces,
not the Rani.

01:10:04.939 --> 01:10:06.376
We were simply outgunned.

01:10:06.898 --> 01:10:08.247
What about the artillery?

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:09.901
You had more than
two dozen cannons.

01:10:09.944 --> 01:10:12.947
Most were sabotaged
by British spies.

01:10:13.513 --> 01:10:14.949
If we used
the ones that remained

01:10:14.993 --> 01:10:16.124
to fire into the melee,

01:10:16.603 --> 01:10:18.910
we would have slaughtered
as many of our men as theirs.

01:10:18.953 --> 01:10:20.868
If I were there, things
would have been different.

01:10:20.912 --> 01:10:22.218
[Rani and Tatya scoff]

01:10:22.696 --> 01:10:25.177
We may have been friends
since we were children,

01:10:25.569 --> 01:10:28.528
but that is no reason
to continue to act like them.

01:10:29.703 --> 01:10:32.619
Or have you already forgotten
who usurped your kingdom?

01:10:34.099 --> 01:10:36.188
I was a loyal ally
to the British,

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:39.191
and they repaid my friendship
with treachery.

01:10:40.714 --> 01:10:42.412
Now we must show them
the price of betrayal.

01:10:42.455 --> 01:10:45.458
Then maybe we should focus
on how to win the next battle,

01:10:45.502 --> 01:10:48.505
rather than debate
why we lost the last one.

01:10:52.987 --> 01:10:54.424
We must attack the British lines

01:10:54.467 --> 01:10:55.729
at the ravines of Koonch.

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:57.731
[Rani] The terrain
does not favor us.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:00.473
They have outflanked us
again and again,

01:11:00.517 --> 01:11:02.954
forcing us to fight
from a position of weakness.

01:11:03.433 --> 01:11:04.347
Rani Saheb.

01:11:04.825 --> 01:11:07.524
I'm... I'm sorry,
but this is urgent.

01:11:08.089 --> 01:11:09.917
Can I have a word
with you in private?

01:11:17.969 --> 01:11:19.187
We've been betrayed.

01:11:20.319 --> 01:11:21.929
Your... Your father...

01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:26.891
Did he suffer?

01:13:52.123 --> 01:13:55.256
They cut them down like dogs,
the filthy little bastards!

[Queen] Did I not say
"No excesses"?

01:15:35.182 --> 01:15:37.620
It appears they had no choice.

01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:38.795
No choice?

01:15:40.927 --> 01:15:45.497
Who forced them to pillage,
burn and rape?

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:46.672
[sighs]

01:15:47.107 --> 01:15:52.156
Who forced them to murder
innocents by the thousands?

01:15:59.685 --> 01:16:00.556
Sit!

01:16:02.906 --> 01:16:05.778
These massacres
will stain the British Empire

01:16:05.822 --> 01:16:07.214
to the end of time!

01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:10.827
And granting the East India
Company this Charter

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:13.743
may go down as one of this
government's worst decisions!

01:16:13.786 --> 01:16:18.312
These events,
tragic as they are, may...

01:16:19.792 --> 01:16:23.317
well, either end this mutiny,

01:16:23.361 --> 01:16:26.930
or see the start
of something much larger.

01:16:28.496 --> 01:16:30.586
A war of independence.

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:32.718
[Queen] We cannot allow it

01:16:32.762 --> 01:16:34.198
to be anything more
than the former,

01:16:36.287 --> 01:16:38.506
though the rash deeds
of the East India Company

01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:40.770
have certainly brought us
closer to the latter!

01:16:40.813 --> 01:16:43.686
Sir Hugh Rose has asked
for reinforcements

01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:45.818
from Madras, Bombay and Agra.

01:16:45.862 --> 01:16:49.169

and he will crush them!

since the Marata seat of power
has regained its strength.

This is too much
of an extravagance.

We should be
marshaling our resources,

not wasting them on merrymaking.

01:20:46.363 --> 01:20:48.669

So, did the troops in Gwalior

01:21:58.217 --> 01:22:00.437
do any damage
to her forces, at all?

01:22:01.133 --> 01:22:04.049
They defected en masse
before the battle even began.

01:22:05.659 --> 01:22:07.574
They were supposed
to augment our troops,

01:22:07.618 --> 01:22:08.924
instead they joined the rabble.

01:22:09.228 --> 01:22:11.927
She is becoming a powerful
symbol of resistance.

Now inspiring even our allies
to turn against us.

01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:21.110
We should have killed her
when we had the chance.

01:22:21.153 --> 01:22:22.676
Ha! We didn't have the chance.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.635
If we had, it would have been
the right course.

01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:25.941
Yeah.

Next time, if we take her alive,

01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:32.817
she should be dealt with
severely and without delay.

01:22:33.513 --> 01:22:35.820
On that, we're agreed.

01:22:38.562 --> 01:22:39.955

What more proof do you need?

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.658
He may be trying to give
diplomacy a final chance.

And with the loss
of Scindia's men,

01:22:49.703 --> 01:22:51.749
you would do well
to pray for his success.

trying to sneak into the fort.

I was thinkingabout something you said.

01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:32.311
You told me you had to fight

01:23:33.225 --> 01:23:35.053
because one has to be
true to oneself.

I didn't understand.

But now I believe I do.

to hear about your father.

I had hoped for a fair trial.

01:24:13.222 --> 01:24:14.527

my fate will be decided.

Let me fight alongside you.

01:24:26.539 --> 01:24:27.845
I cannot allow that.

01:24:28.106 --> 01:24:30.543
Is it not what Krishna
told Arjuna to do?

01:24:32.589 --> 01:24:33.677
[sighs]

01:24:34.373 --> 01:24:36.680
If you were captured,
you would be hanged,

01:24:38.116 --> 01:24:40.510
and that was not
part of Arjuna's tale.

01:24:44.557 --> 01:24:46.864
Perhaps it is enough
that I've expressed

01:24:48.126 --> 01:24:49.562
what I would like to do.

01:24:52.261 --> 01:24:53.653

in the time we have left.

It is time for us
to follow our separate paths.

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:28.427
You must promise me

01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:31.126
you will return to England.

the deepest emotions.

For everything
that you have done.

would have showered us

01:27:33.509 --> 01:27:34.597
Rani Saheb.

01:27:35.511 --> 01:27:36.729
[in Marathi]

01:27:57.837 --> 01:27:59.317
-[bells ring]
-[man] They're coming!

01:27:59.361 --> 01:28:01.319
Excellent news.
Excellent news, sir.

01:28:01.363 --> 01:28:03.713
No, no, no. The rebels.
They... They are coming, sir.

01:28:03.756 --> 01:28:05.280
Jesus Christ.

01:28:06.368 --> 01:28:08.283
-Call the alarm.
-Right, sir.

01:28:11.416 --> 01:28:14.027
[horn blows in distance]

01:28:16.029 --> 01:28:18.075
[shouting]

01:28:18.118 --> 01:28:20.120
[horn continues]

01:28:29.086 --> 01:28:31.523
-[bugle plays]
-[all shouting]

01:28:49.193 --> 01:28:50.586
[in Hindi]

01:29:03.773 --> 01:29:05.688
[in Marathi]

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:12.347
[fanfare plays]

01:29:15.219 --> 01:29:16.220
[in Hindi]

01:29:16.699 --> 01:29:17.830
Attack!

01:29:17.874 --> 01:29:19.876
[soldiers shouting]

01:29:21.834 --> 01:29:23.836
[shouting]

01:29:25.664 --> 01:29:27.100
Get a bloody move on!

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:31.322
Forward! Come on!

01:29:49.166 --> 01:29:50.515
[Rose] Kill every
bloody one of them!

01:29:53.562 --> 01:29:54.432
Fire!

01:30:00.525 --> 01:30:01.787
My God.

01:30:12.276 --> 01:30:13.669
[in Marathi]

01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:15.671
Let's move away and attack

01:30:15.714 --> 01:30:17.412
from the other quarter.
We can help that way.

01:30:17.455 --> 01:30:19.065
-Come on! Let's go!
-[horse snorts]

01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:20.415
[shouts in Hindi]

01:30:21.024 --> 01:30:22.417
[screaming]

01:30:30.773 --> 01:30:31.774
[Rani grunts]

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.654
[gasps]

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:50.053
She's like Joan of Arc.

01:31:06.591 --> 01:31:07.679
Take aim!

01:31:08.288 --> 01:31:09.420
[Rani urges horse]

01:31:14.556 --> 01:31:17.167
Front rank! Reload!

01:31:22.564 --> 01:31:23.608
Fire!

01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:27.177
[gasps]

01:31:27.917 --> 01:31:28.961
Fire!

01:31:39.798 --> 01:31:42.540
[prime minister] We have
lately had our attention

01:31:42.584 --> 01:31:45.369
called to scenes of barbarity

01:31:45.412 --> 01:31:46.588
in India.

01:31:46.631 --> 01:31:48.851
Scenes which would
make any man shudder.

01:31:49.678 --> 01:31:52.419
But, at last,
the battle has been won.

01:31:52.463 --> 01:31:54.639
The mutiny
has been suppressed.

01:31:54.683 --> 01:31:57.120
And with such a conclusion,

01:31:57.468 --> 01:32:00.079
the time for change has come.

01:32:00.384 --> 01:32:03.169
We have a great duty
to fulfill in India.

01:32:03.692 --> 01:32:06.129
We must use our power
in such a manner

01:32:06.172 --> 01:32:09.132
as to promote the enlightenment

01:32:09.175 --> 01:32:13.484
and the civilization
of those great populations

01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:16.443
which are subject to our will.

01:32:17.662 --> 01:32:19.751
For this reason,
we have decided

01:32:19.795 --> 01:32:22.275
that our duty
will be best discharged

01:32:22.319 --> 01:32:25.322
if we commit its performance
to the hands of men

01:32:25.365 --> 01:32:28.891
who will be accountable to
Parliament for their conduct.

01:32:29.892 --> 01:32:33.025
The East India Company
has done many good things.

01:32:33.373 --> 01:32:35.375
But there can be no doubt,

01:32:35.419 --> 01:32:37.943
so far as the impression
on the minds

01:32:37.987 --> 01:32:40.380
of the people of India
is concerned,

01:32:40.946 --> 01:32:43.079
that the name of the Sovereign

01:32:43.427 --> 01:32:45.472
will be far more respected,

01:32:45.516 --> 01:32:47.605
far more calculated to produce

01:32:47.649 --> 01:32:49.955
moral and political impressions

01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:52.958
than the name
of a company of merchants,

01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:56.701
however respectable
and able they may be.

01:33:00.096 --> 01:33:03.316
We propose, therefore,
that the East India Company

01:33:03.882 --> 01:33:05.144
be abolished.

01:33:06.624 --> 01:33:09.409
The company's shareholders
need not be alarmed.

01:33:09.453 --> 01:33:13.022
They will keep their dividend
for more than a decade,

01:33:13.065 --> 01:33:17.156
at which point, they will be
handsomely compensated

01:33:17.896 --> 01:33:20.203
by the taxpayers of India.

01:33:20.856 --> 01:33:23.598
I therefore ask to send
for the House to approve

01:33:23.641 --> 01:33:25.904
the Act forthe Better Government of India.

01:33:26.252 --> 01:33:27.732
Hear hear!

01:33:28.254 --> 01:33:29.255
So that's it, is it?

01:33:30.213 --> 01:33:32.519
We defeated the Rani,
but lost the company.

01:33:33.695 --> 01:33:36.480
I tell you,
women are going to lose us

01:33:36.523 --> 01:33:37.873
this whole bloody Empire.

01:33:37.916 --> 01:33:39.265
Times are changing, Robert.

01:33:39.309 --> 01:33:41.441
It would do you good
to keep up.

01:34:15.693 --> 01:34:18.174
[Rani] But this cannot be
the end of my story.

01:34:19.305 --> 01:34:22.047
It seems I, like Arjuna's tale,

01:34:22.787 --> 01:34:24.920
eluded one single truth.

01:34:28.314 --> 01:34:29.925
[people sobbing]

01:34:29.968 --> 01:34:33.276
[Rani] Some say I was cremated
with great ceremony

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:35.800
under a tamarind tree
by the rock of Gwalior.

01:34:40.065 --> 01:34:43.634
Some say I gave all my jewels
to my soldiers

01:34:44.156 --> 01:34:46.681
worth far more than the bounty
on my head.

01:34:48.987 --> 01:34:50.641
[horse neighs]

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:54.863
Some say I lived on.

01:34:56.038 --> 01:34:58.736
And whenever or wherever

01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:00.607
there were battles
to be fought,

01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:05.395
I would appear
to help the righteous

01:35:05.438 --> 01:35:07.658
triumph over the oppressors.

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:11.183
But whatever happened,

01:35:11.923 --> 01:35:14.752
I live on in a far more
significant place.

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:19.888
In the hearts and minds
of my people.

01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:16.379
[Rani] I was but one of many.

01:36:17.336 --> 01:36:18.773
When you remember my name,

01:36:19.382 --> 01:36:21.079
take a moment to also remember

01:36:21.123 --> 01:36:24.909
the nameless men and women
whose blood soaked our soil,

01:36:25.649 --> 01:36:27.564
nurturing the seeds of freedom,

01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:32.047
allowing them
to take root and flower.

01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:36.399
Use the rights
we could only dream of.

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:40.751
Then my spirit will live on
in each of you,

01:36:41.665 --> 01:36:44.015
and you in me.
