My client knows
who attacked the Vatican.

He's willing
to share his information,

14:07.672 --> 14:09.718
under a few conditions.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.720

14:11.763 --> 14:13.591
This is a sensitive matter.

discuss it at my office.

Reece with my bare hands,

what we want, do we?

your assistance with leniency.

14:30.304 --> 14:33.742
I would help him after
all the people he's killed.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.397
That man murdered my father,
so he can rot.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.661
The knowledge he has now
could save many lives.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.793

before I walk away for good.

14:45.493 --> 14:47.321
Fine. Fine.

14:49.410 --> 14:52.630
A few months ago,
a man came to visit him.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.763
He wanted information
on Genghis Khan.

14:54.806 --> 14:57.592
Now, that symbol
they left behind?

14:58.941 --> 15:01.857
This man had part of it
branded onto him.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.598
He was looking for

15:03.641 --> 15:06.383
something called
the "Soul of Genghis Khan."

15:06.427 --> 15:08.429
"The Soul of Genghis Khan."

15:10.431 --> 15:13.651
Wha-- what does he want
with an 800-year-old relic?

15:13.695 --> 15:16.306
And what does that have
to do with Reece?

15:16.350 --> 15:18.743
The truth? My client didn't know

15:18.787 --> 15:20.441
what the man was talking about.

15:20.484 --> 15:21.964
But the man insisted
my client's father,

15:22.008 --> 15:25.011
Jacob Reece II, did.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.969
Reece's father died
40 years ago.

15:27.013 --> 15:30.320
The man wanted something from
the Reece family's deep storage.

15:30.364 --> 15:31.800
No, those were all
cleared out by Interpol.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.584

My client maintains
there was one thing

15:36.544 --> 15:38.241

Interpol did not manage

15:38.285 --> 15:39.677
to find in their sweep.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.638
And he'll tell you where it is.

find the people

15:51.037 --> 15:52.647

the Vatican,

15:52.690 --> 15:55.693
I'd think it was maybe
worth meeting him.

What in the hell is the
Soul of Genghis Khan?

16:24.853 --> 16:27.508
It was also called
"the Spirit Banner."

16:27.551 --> 16:30.337
The greatest relic
from the Mongolian Empire.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.643
About six feet high,

16:32.687 --> 16:35.255
with braided horse hair
hung in a ring at its top.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.735
Bound in gold.Ooh.

16:37.779 --> 16:40.390
Genghis Khan carried it
with him into every battle.

16:40.434 --> 16:41.957
And when he died,
it was said that

16:42.001 --> 16:43.828
his spirit entered
the Banner.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.656
Right.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.832
Hitler and Stalin
both went after it.

16:47.876 --> 16:51.314
Stalin apparently got it
during the Soviet occupation

16:51.358 --> 16:53.838
of Mongolia in the late 1930s.
From there...

16:53.882 --> 16:56.972
it disappeared.So two of the worst people
in history were obsessed

16:57.016 --> 16:59.757
with the same artifact,
and now somebody new wants it?

16:59.801 --> 17:01.455
Exactly.
Great.

the general of the carabinieri.

a deal with Reece.Wait.

that wasn't all just

the Vatican,

He was stabbed two dozen times.

the whole truth about him.

that he reached out to us.
