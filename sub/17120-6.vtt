I'm back in Germany. You have a

if you do nothing, you will die.

00:06.876 --> 00:09.727
Gem, I need to tell you something.
There's someone...

00:09.752 --> 00:12.695
Well, some things don't need
to be said out loud, do they?

00:13.072 --> 00:15.996
What the three of us
did to that poor girl.

00:16.021 --> 00:17.370
The three of you?

00:17.370 --> 00:18.810
Who was the third person?

00:18.810 --> 00:20.770
JULIEN:
Your father killed a girl in Iraq.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.610
Leave. Right now.

00:22.610 --> 00:24.450
It's hard, I know,
to find out the ones you love

00:24.450 --> 00:26.290
are not who you thought they were.

00:26.922 --> 00:29.085
JULIEN: I was followed
when I went to the bank.

00:29.251 --> 00:31.239
Someone hoping to steal from me.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.598
We can fix this.

00:32.598 --> 00:34.358
I'm not ready to go.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.938
And when you come back, there's
something I want to show you.

00:38.412 --> 00:39.975
I'm bloody pregnant.

00:41.551 --> 00:43.280
EVE: Kristian Herz's wife Nadia

00:43.305 --> 00:45.581
was found beaten half to death
last night.

00:45.606 --> 00:46.690
She's in a coma.

00:46.690 --> 00:49.284
GEMMA: That is Alice's necklace -
with the bird.

00:49.309 --> 00:50.327
EVE: I recognise it.

00:50.327 --> 00:53.721
Lena Garber?
She was reported missing in 2008.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.732
That's me and Mummy,

Have you been a good girl?

02:18.098 --> 02:20.258
I had a nightmare.

02:20.283 --> 02:21.323
Oh...

02:22.212 --> 02:23.892
Is it because of what you saw?

02:26.233 --> 02:27.793
I had to protect us.

02:30.033 --> 02:32.753
Because of the bad men? Mm.

02:34.451 --> 02:36.291
Yes, they're everywhere, Lucy.

02:36.987 --> 02:37.957
You know that.

If I can just see these records...

06:32.018 --> 06:33.178
Why?

06:35.525 --> 06:36.845
I spoke to your father.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.205
- You did what?
- I told you, your father and Henry Reed

06:40.205 --> 06:42.325
committed a crime
when they were in Iraq together.

06:42.325 --> 06:44.165
Oh, Christ, Baptiste,
not this shit again!

06:44.165 --> 06:46.805
When I talked to him,
he said there was a third person.

06:46.805 --> 06:48.793
If I could find out
who this person was...

06:48.818 --> 06:51.738
My father can't remember
who I am from one day to the next.

06:51.738 --> 06:54.978
- Whatever you think he said...
- What harm can it do for me to look?

06:57.034 --> 06:57.807
No.

06:58.521 --> 07:00.723
You don't get to accuse my father
of killing someone

07:00.723 --> 07:03.283
and then ask for a favour.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.458

17:35.418 --> 17:37.058
I do blame you.

17:46.296 --> 17:48.618
And I blame your mum.

17:50.818 --> 17:53.178
But most of all, I blame me.

17:56.418 --> 17:59.418
Because when Alice walked back
into our lives, we weren't ready.

18:01.458 --> 18:03.018

will this be the day she wakes up?

19:05.208 --> 19:07.658
I came out of the coma
a few months ago.

19:09.658 --> 19:12.771
And I couldn't work. I couldn't
string a sentence together.

19:15.098 --> 19:17.790
Yesterday,
they finally let me go home.

19:21.849 --> 19:22.969
I'm so...

19:23.788 --> 19:25.880
..so sorry for what happened to you.

19:30.049 --> 19:33.060

last year,

19:43.769 --> 19:45.945
a few days before you were arrested?

19:46.511 --> 19:49.628
Turns out it was handed into
lost property at Anstrom Park.

19:49.653 --> 19:52.413
Anstrom Park? Why, I...?

19:52.413 --> 19:55.293
I was attacked before I could
open it. So I only saw it yesterday.

19:55.293 --> 19:56.933
But, darling, I...

19:56.933 --> 19:58.533
I don't understand...

20:01.768 --> 20:03.693
I found pictures.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.575
Kristian...

20:09.456 --> 20:11.096
..pictures of the girl.

20:13.354 --> 20:15.754
But how? I don't understand.

20:16.145 --> 20:17.185
It wasn't me.

20:18.145 --> 20:19.842
Darling, I never...

20:20.505 --> 20:22.025
You must believe me!

20:22.222 --> 20:25.102
There are only city birds
in Anstrom Park.

20:25.102 --> 20:26.862
Why would I go there?

20:28.262 --> 20:32.182
This is somebody trying to make
it seem I'm guilty.

20:32.182 --> 20:35.102
One year now, they have nothing.
No proof.

20:35.102 --> 20:37.462
Only the words of a poor girl,

20:37.462 --> 20:39.982
who was driven to madness
and suicide.

20:39.982 --> 20:42.342
And now,
with the trial weeks away...

20:42.342 --> 20:44.102
this camera shows up,

20:44.102 --> 20:45.818
damning me, out of nowhere.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.520
It's too late.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.541
I gave the camera to the police.
It's up to them now.

20:59.804 --> 21:02.353
People need to know who you are.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.241
DOOR BUZZES

21:27.692 --> 21:30.350
WOMAN ON TV: A source has told me

21:30.375 --> 21:33.109
that a key piece of evidence has
come to light.

21:33.109 --> 21:33.636
PHONE RINGS

21:33.636 --> 21:35.821
This piece of evidence
makes it all but certain

21:35.821 --> 21:38.332
that Kristian Herz will be
found guilty

21:38.357 --> 21:40.765
of the abduction of Alice Webster.

21:41.757 --> 21:42.997
Hello?

21:42.997 --> 21:44.197
'Mrs Webster.'

21:44.197 --> 21:46.637
It's Julien Baptiste.
'Baptiste.'

21:46.637 --> 21:48.797
I heard you weren't well.

21:48.797 --> 21:52.077
'Yes. Unfortunately the last year
hasn't been easy.

21:52.077 --> 21:53.917
'But, you know, we go on.

21:54.997 --> 21:57.102
'Forgive me for calling,
Mrs Webster.'

21:57.102 --> 21:59.743
It seems there is new evidence,

21:59.951 --> 22:01.120
A camera.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.160
Oh.

22:04.208 --> 22:06.128
- Yeah.
- 'A magazine here in France'

22:06.128 --> 22:10.302
re-printed an old interview
with you from many months ago.

22:10.302 --> 22:13.229
In it, you talk about your daughter

22:13.254 --> 22:16.214
and a story she once told
about a rollercoaster.

22:16.239 --> 22:18.100
Erm, Mr Baptiste,
I don't really understand...

22:18.100 --> 22:21.248
'It gave me an idea.
I believe the description'

22:21.273 --> 22:25.513
of the theme park narrows it down
to just one possibility.

22:25.538 --> 22:30.147
I have spoken with Jorn Lenhart,
from the Polizei. He's a friend.

22:30.147 --> 22:32.473
He's going to see
if any further leads

22:32.498 --> 22:33.702
'might come from this.'

22:33.702 --> 22:36.696
But I... I mean, we know
what happened to my daughter.

22:36.721 --> 22:38.041
We know...

22:38.468 --> 22:41.046
..who took her, so...

22:41.611 --> 22:43.519
..what's the point
in digging up the past again?

22:43.519 --> 22:44.887
'Because I still do not believe'

22:44.887 --> 22:47.688
the girl who perished in that fire
was your daughter.

22:55.927 --> 22:57.127
They, er...

22:58.127 --> 23:00.567
..they tested her DNA, Mr Baptiste.

23:00.567 --> 23:04.208
'You know, the DNA test
on the remains in that shed,'

23:04.233 --> 23:07.266
this was conducted
by the British Army.

23:07.266 --> 23:08.598
Not the German Polizei.

23:08.623 --> 23:09.838
'Yes, but what difference
would it make?'

23:09.838 --> 23:12.420
I mean, I'd like to change
the facts, Mr Baptiste.

23:12.445 --> 23:13.899
As much as I'd like to, I can't.

23:13.899 --> 23:16.797
'Detective Lenhart and I
were also looking into a man,

23:16.822 --> 23:19.925
'before my health forced me
to leave Eckhausen.'

23:20.052 --> 23:23.692
This man, Henry Reed,
was a soldier in the Army.

23:23.693 --> 23:27.659
He was murdered, his death
made to look like a suicide...

23:27.684 --> 23:29.442
'And soon after,

23:29.442 --> 23:32.302
'the British Army
are given unprecedented powers

23:32.327 --> 23:36.287
'in an investigation that should
have been German jurisdiction.'

23:38.207 --> 23:39.344
But it was her.

23:41.081 --> 23:42.579
It had to be her.

23:43.481 --> 23:46.320
'Science, Mrs Webster, doesn't lie.

23:46.345 --> 23:47.965
'I would never pretend so.'

23:47.965 --> 23:50.140
But people...people lie
all the time.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.123
What if somebody

23:52.148 --> 23:54.988
'in the British Army
lied about the DNA test?'

23:58.271 --> 23:59.142
Mr Baptiste...

23:59.142 --> 24:01.190
'why would you tell me something
like this?'

24:03.009 --> 24:05.089
Because I am dying, Mrs Webster.

24:06.289 --> 24:08.489
I cannot fight any longer
for the truth.

24:08.489 --> 24:09.609
'You can.

24:10.569 --> 24:12.965
'You know that girl
was not your daughter.

24:14.154 --> 24:16.074
'You, better than anyone.'

24:19.114 --> 24:20.434
SHE TURNS HER PHONE OFF

24:30.394 --> 24:31.594
HE SIGHS

24:31.594 --> 24:32.874
Julien...

24:32.874 --> 24:34.874
you're supposed to be resting.

24:39.654 --> 24:43.194
My body is being poisoned.
I...require distraction.

24:45.714 --> 24:47.234
You mentioned...

24:49.114 --> 24:50.914
..there was new evidence.

24:50.914 --> 24:52.834
Proving what? Guilt?

24:55.154 --> 24:56.874
So it seems.

24:56.874 --> 24:57.914
SHE SIGHS

24:59.234 --> 25:01.114
You have to let it go, my love.

25:03.994 --> 25:06.354
When Jorn Lenhart called last year,

25:06.354 --> 25:10.125
saying that you'd had a fit
in the car and, for a moment...

25:10.754 --> 25:12.954
..I don't know, I stopped
listening, I was so panicked.

25:14.394 --> 25:16.834
I thought he was saying
that you were dead.

25:18.394 --> 25:19.994
It was just for a moment, but...

25:20.742 --> 25:22.062
..but now I know.

25:23.274 --> 25:26.180
I know exactly how it would feel
to lose you.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.994
I don't want to feel
like that again.

25:31.674 --> 25:34.194
You have to put it behind you,
my love.

25:36.236 --> 25:38.274
Focus on getting better.

25:46.354 --> 25:48.874
I spoke to Jorn Lenhart,
you know, like you said.

25:48.874 --> 25:49.994
And, er...

25:49.994 --> 25:51.634
Sorry, please.

25:54.034 --> 25:55.634
Well, I...I found something.

26:02.689 --> 26:04.489
This is the girl who came back.

26:04.489 --> 26:06.769
This is my daughter Alice.

26:07.229 --> 26:10.549
And the girl behind them
is wearing my daughter's necklace.

26:12.933 --> 26:14.093
Remarkable.

26:14.118 --> 26:16.147
Can you print this picture for me?

26:16.147 --> 26:18.107
- It might be of help.
- Of course.

26:18.107 --> 26:21.347
Staff Sergeant Stone is looking into
the identity of the third girl,

26:21.347 --> 26:23.107
along with the German police, so...

26:23.107 --> 26:24.667
- maybe, if they find out...
- Good.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.387
Then there is hope.

26:26.387 --> 26:29.267
But, Mrs Webster,
that's not why I'm here.

26:31.306 --> 26:33.387
It was a tragedy.

26:33.387 --> 26:35.707
There was Henry Reed and, erm...

26:36.867 --> 26:39.387
..the other soldier
was Brigadier Stone.

26:39.387 --> 26:40.867
Eve Stone's father.

26:41.758 --> 26:44.747
I believe he knows more
about your daughter's abduction.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.867
Are you telling me
Brigadier Stone did it?

26:48.867 --> 26:51.667
Only that he was
involved, in some way.

26:51.890 --> 26:53.810
Involved? How?

26:53.810 --> 26:55.650
Oh, love, it's not...

26:55.650 --> 26:57.737
What does Stone know about
what happened to Alice?

26:57.737 --> 26:59.897
The wrong man was convicted
for this crime.

26:59.897 --> 27:03.175
And, yes, I believe former
Brigadier Stone knows something.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.137
And you believe this?

27:11.217 --> 27:12.250
Yeah.

27:12.811 --> 27:14.351
Yeah, I do.

27:14.376 --> 27:15.816
Jesus Christ!

27:19.907 --> 27:21.387
DOOR SLAMS

27:21.701 --> 27:22.861
Oh...!

27:23.831 --> 27:25.591
Do you need to follow him?

27:25.616 --> 27:26.757
No. Erm...

27:26.757 --> 27:28.797
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, carry on.

27:28.798 --> 27:31.811
Brigadier Stone told me
there was a third person

27:31.836 --> 27:34.516
involved in the terrible events
of 1991.

27:34.516 --> 27:36.245
I need to find out who this was.

27:36.245 --> 27:38.612
For that,
I need access to Army records.

27:38.637 --> 27:41.317
The name of every single person
in Stone's unit.

27:41.644 --> 27:43.642
These records are confidential.

27:43.642 --> 27:47.082
But you,
with your husband's connections...

27:47.082 --> 27:49.402
Well, you could find a way
to look at them.

27:49.402 --> 27:50.962
I can't talk to him.

27:51.565 --> 27:53.485
I can't talk to him about
anything any more.

27:54.605 --> 27:57.245
There is another way
of getting those files.

27:57.773 --> 27:59.533
You teach on the camp.

28:01.571 --> 28:03.331
I can't help you.

28:03.613 --> 28:05.510
I'm sorry.
But maybe Eve can help you,

28:05.510 --> 28:07.378
if they find something
to do with this picture.

28:07.378 --> 28:08.618
Eve...

28:08.618 --> 28:11.110
So we sit and we wait

28:11.135 --> 28:12.397
and, er...

28:12.397 --> 28:13.797
we hope.

28:16.117 --> 28:19.197
RAPPING IN GERMAN

28:33.197 --> 28:34.717
What's wrong, Matty?

28:37.237 --> 28:39.968
That French detective
came to my house.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.008
He reckons the guy that used to run
the Army garrison

28:42.007 --> 28:44.247
has something to do with my
sister's disappearance.

28:44.247 --> 28:47.327
- You believe this?
- I don't know. But my mum does.

28:47.327 --> 28:48.847
And the French cop does.

28:49.766 --> 28:52.601
The Army, they always
look out for their own.

28:52.626 --> 28:54.842
So, what are you going to do
about it?

28:55.906 --> 28:57.586
- What do you mean?
- Action, Matty.

28:57.586 --> 28:59.826
Just like me and Axel did
with that bitch.

28:59.826 --> 29:02.546
IN GERMAN:

29:05.626 --> 29:07.421
Well, except
if this French guy's right.

29:07.421 --> 29:09.621
- Then maybe she wasn't involved.
- These Army arseholes,

29:09.620 --> 29:11.660
you know it, Matty,
they keep each other's secrets.

29:11.660 --> 29:13.300
That bitch, this guy...

29:13.300 --> 29:15.460
- What's he called?
- Stone.

29:15.460 --> 29:16.620
Stone.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.380
Probably in it together.

29:19.380 --> 29:21.020
One way to find out.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.460
When, Julien?

29:48.260 --> 29:50.260
When do you say "enough"?

30:15.380 --> 30:17.420
TELEVISION ON

30:17.420 --> 30:19.580
DOOR OPENS

30:34.900 --> 30:36.060
Mr Stone...

30:36.060 --> 30:37.460
do you remember me?

30:37.460 --> 30:39.140
I was watching my programmes.

30:39.140 --> 30:42.420
I wanted to talk with you more
about your time in Iraq.

30:42.938 --> 30:44.378
Who are you?

30:44.964 --> 30:46.564
My name is Julien Baptiste.

30:50.117 --> 30:51.877
I'm a friend of your daughter's.

30:52.997 --> 30:54.357
Leave me alone.

30:54.357 --> 30:56.868
There is nothing to worry about,
Mr Stone.

30:56.868 --> 31:00.662
I just want to share some memories
about the desert.

31:02.347 --> 31:06.197
How did you feel, as a young man,
on operations in Iraq?

31:08.412 --> 31:09.892
Get out!

31:14.228 --> 31:16.148
I don't know who you are...

31:16.892 --> 31:20.382
..but you are addressing
a superior officer!

31:20.407 --> 31:21.696
There were three of you,

31:21.696 --> 31:23.025
that's what you said.

31:23.025 --> 31:25.416
"What the three of us did to that
poor girl."

31:25.441 --> 31:27.080
You and Henry Reed.
Who else?

31:27.080 --> 31:28.096
Show some respect!

31:28.121 --> 31:31.225
Tell me what you know about
the girls in this photo.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.572
I said, get out!

31:36.479 --> 31:38.402
Stand down, soldier!

31:43.800 --> 31:44.892
Henry Reed.

31:44.892 --> 31:46.372
1991.

31:46.700 --> 31:47.945
Who was with you?

31:47.945 --> 31:49.265
Who was it, Mr Stone?

31:49.265 --> 31:51.145
- Give me the name!
- Hey!

31:51.145 --> 31:53.945
IN GERMAN:

31:57.329 --> 31:59.609
I merely wanted to talk with him.

32:00.322 --> 32:02.602
The man got upset. He attacked me.

32:02.969 --> 32:05.785
He...hurt me. You better leave now
or we call the police.

32:05.785 --> 32:06.905
He was confused.

32:06.906 --> 32:08.106
Sir, leave now.

32:31.506 --> 32:33.186
CAR BRAKES SCREECH

32:34.426 --> 32:35.906
HE PANTS

32:43.986 --> 32:45.826
HE RETCHES

32:48.911 --> 32:50.191
Urgh...!

32:54.946 --> 32:56.346
You've failed.

33:03.106 --> 33:05.386
No-one here
believes a word you say.

33:07.302 --> 33:08.862
What are you doing?

33:09.354 --> 33:10.394
To yourself.

33:10.799 --> 33:11.919
To us.

33:14.677 --> 33:15.590
I know.

33:15.679 --> 33:17.039
So come home.

33:37.986 --> 33:39.986
IN FRENCH:

34:04.106 --> 34:05.626
CELIA: You ran away.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.386
IN FRENCH:

34:09.386 --> 34:12.585
But...I had information.
It couldn't wait.

34:13.478 --> 34:16.456
MARLENE: 'Mr Baptiste,
I thought you should know,

34:16.482 --> 34:18.002
'I heard from Daniel.

34:19.167 --> 34:21.007
'It's an e-mail.

34:21.592 --> 34:24.152
'It says he learned something
about his father.'

34:25.654 --> 34:28.134
- What did he learn?
- 'He doesn't say.

34:28.159 --> 34:31.918
'He just talks about the sunset
near some place called Azwya.'

34:32.466 --> 34:33.545
Azwya?

34:34.205 --> 34:37.656
I couldn't lie in a hospital bed
waiting for the devil to take me.

34:37.985 --> 34:39.426
IN FRENCH:

34:42.946 --> 34:44.346
Remy...

34:44.346 --> 34:47.072
You let us go back into
that hospital and wait for you,

34:47.072 --> 34:49.033
thinking you just needed
to summon your nerve.

34:49.033 --> 34:52.152
You know, the surgeon,
the nurses, everyone!

34:52.152 --> 34:55.998
I had to go back in there and tell
them I didn't know where you were!

34:56.024 --> 34:57.584
You ran away!

34:57.584 --> 35:00.064
You ran away for one last moment in
the sun

35:00.064 --> 35:02.024
for the Great Detective Baptiste,

35:02.024 --> 35:03.904
because we're not enough for you!

35:03.904 --> 35:05.144
IN FRENCH:

35:14.024 --> 35:15.064
You're done.

35:24.984 --> 35:26.304
Oh...

35:34.184 --> 35:35.344
Gemma...

35:36.344 --> 35:37.784
I need to speak to you.

35:39.504 --> 35:40.704
Come in.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.144
Have a seat.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.424
I won't be long.

35:54.584 --> 35:55.664
So...

35:57.867 --> 35:59.864
Sam told me about the baby.

36:05.224 --> 36:06.464
Right.

36:08.384 --> 36:09.664
Well...

36:10.784 --> 36:13.264
I'm sick of hearing myself
say sorry.

36:13.264 --> 36:14.704
For all the good it'll do.

36:15.904 --> 36:17.304
But I am.

36:23.064 --> 36:24.624
Are you keeping it?

36:26.264 --> 36:27.464
No.

36:32.624 --> 36:34.544
It must have been hard for you,
back then.

36:35.784 --> 36:38.288
Carrying...a baby for nine months.

36:39.984 --> 36:41.264
Being a mother and then...

36:42.224 --> 36:44.104
Well, then suddenly, you weren't.

36:44.104 --> 36:46.584
I knew what I was letting
myself in for when I agreed.

36:46.584 --> 36:48.064
I wanted to help my sister.

36:48.064 --> 36:50.131
It doesn't make it any easier,
though, does it?

36:51.864 --> 36:54.224
I know what it's like
to lose a child.

36:56.184 --> 36:57.744
What happened to me is...

36:57.744 --> 37:01.414
is nothing like
what you had to endure.

37:01.439 --> 37:02.594
What I'm trying to say is

37:02.594 --> 37:04.714
you shouldn't have to go through
that again.

37:04.714 --> 37:06.394
It's the right thing to do.

37:06.394 --> 37:07.979
GEMMA SIGHS

37:07.979 --> 37:09.979
If you don't want to keep
the baby,

37:09.979 --> 37:11.479
that's your choice.

37:11.479 --> 37:14.919
But if you're getting rid of it
for Sam's sake, or for mine...

37:16.839 --> 37:19.239
Sometimes you're allowed to be
selfish.

37:20.359 --> 37:22.079
Sometimes you have to be.

37:28.068 --> 37:29.588
PHONE RINGS

37:29.959 --> 37:31.479
I am so sorry.

37:31.479 --> 37:32.839
I need to take this.

37:32.839 --> 37:34.319
Excuse me.

37:38.519 --> 37:39.959
Staff Sergeant Stone.

38:03.839 --> 38:05.599
PHONE RINGS

38:07.159 --> 38:08.479
You're late.

38:10.999 --> 38:12.996
The phone was being used.

38:13.559 --> 38:16.669
If you would just get one
for the cabin...

38:16.694 --> 38:19.294
'If we're going to make a life out
there, it has to be off the grid.

38:19.294 --> 38:20.334
'So just...

38:20.777 --> 38:22.817
'So just think, Sophie.'

38:23.546 --> 38:25.010
You ring me at the right time.

38:25.010 --> 38:27.608
Morning. Afternoon. Evening.
Have you got that?

38:29.130 --> 38:30.570
I'm sorry.

38:36.090 --> 38:37.650
OK, then.

38:37.650 --> 38:39.650
'Can I speak to Lucy?'

38:39.650 --> 38:41.410
No, she's playing.

38:43.210 --> 38:44.690
I miss her.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.050
I miss you.

38:48.658 --> 38:50.498
'Well, we'll be together soon.

38:51.139 --> 38:52.619
'In, like, two weeks.

38:53.119 --> 38:54.559
'We're so close.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.170
'So just...'

38:56.170 --> 38:58.083
Just be patient, OK?

39:00.130 --> 39:01.370
'I will.'

39:01.980 --> 39:04.285
- Do you love me?
- 'Yes.'

39:07.010 --> 39:08.130
Good girl.

40:42.330 --> 40:44.890
SLOPS SLOSH IN THE BUCKET

40:44.890 --> 40:46.810
I'll get you a clean one
in a minute.

40:57.130 --> 40:58.250
Here...

41:03.690 --> 41:04.958
Good day?

41:05.437 --> 41:06.797
Yeah.

41:07.536 --> 41:09.941
Lucy drew a picture of you.

41:12.639 --> 41:14.559
Well, she got my nose right, eh?

41:18.453 --> 41:20.277
It stinks in here.

41:22.757 --> 41:24.277
Yeah.

41:24.277 --> 41:25.517
You know...

41:26.390 --> 41:27.972
..you don't have to lock the door,

41:27.972 --> 41:30.092
and then we could use the bathroom.

41:31.851 --> 41:33.611
You can trust me now.

41:33.611 --> 41:36.410
- After everything I've done...
- It's not that I don't trust you.

41:37.291 --> 41:38.891
Or that I want to lock you in.

41:40.503 --> 41:42.651
It's that I want to keep
other people out.

41:43.306 --> 41:44.866
Well, who'd come in?

41:45.171 --> 41:46.211
Well...

41:46.881 --> 41:48.074
..you never know.

41:52.816 --> 41:54.651
You look exhausted, love.

41:57.251 --> 41:59.251
I saw that guy
in the street again today.

42:00.731 --> 42:02.371
Same as before.

42:03.263 --> 42:04.423
He was just...

42:05.691 --> 42:06.891
..just looking at me.

42:07.931 --> 42:10.051
Looking at the windows.

42:10.051 --> 42:11.931
He probably just lives
around here.

42:11.931 --> 42:13.691
He's probably just walking his dog.

42:13.691 --> 42:15.211
Probably isn't good enough.

42:15.211 --> 42:18.491
Probably gets you taken away.
Probably is a fucking tripwire!

42:26.122 --> 42:28.005
We can't live like this.

42:28.990 --> 42:31.571
It's not good for you. Or me.

42:31.571 --> 42:33.291
And it's not good for Lucy.

42:35.089 --> 42:36.329
Before it was...

42:37.731 --> 42:38.811
..simpler.

42:40.462 --> 42:42.188
I thought...

42:42.188 --> 42:44.505
everything we did
after you went to hospital,

42:44.505 --> 42:46.985
I thought it'd mean that people
would stop looking for you.

42:49.476 --> 42:51.025
We could be safe.

42:53.065 --> 42:54.585
We could be a family.

42:56.145 --> 42:57.594
But now, I...

42:58.265 --> 43:00.745
Every time the doorbell rings,
my heart...

43:00.745 --> 43:02.785
feels like it's trapped
in my throat.

43:05.065 --> 43:06.625
So let's go.

43:08.465 --> 43:11.065
Let's go somewhere. And...

43:11.065 --> 43:13.825
- it could just be us, we could be free.
- It's not that simple.

43:13.825 --> 43:15.385
Our lives are here.

43:19.585 --> 43:20.985
We could start afresh.

43:22.105 --> 43:23.745
Take a leap of faith.

43:34.105 --> 43:36.775
And you know I do all this
for you, don't you?

43:39.065 --> 43:40.345
I know.

43:47.745 --> 43:49.105
Good girl.

43:56.545 --> 43:59.105
BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS

44:01.465 --> 44:03.225
MAN: Mr Webster,
will you be at the court?

44:09.785 --> 44:10.905
Hi.

44:10.905 --> 44:12.065
Hey.

44:13.385 --> 44:16.145
You think they're going to be
there all the way through the trial,

44:16.145 --> 44:17.585
- watching us?
- Oh, God knows.

44:27.625 --> 44:29.225
I spoke to Matthew.

44:30.425 --> 44:33.965
- We're going to go for a pint later.
Like we used to, so... - Oh, yeah?

44:45.345 --> 44:47.705
And I've been thinking about
scaling back at work.

44:47.705 --> 44:49.305
You know, give us more time.

44:52.394 --> 44:54.114
Are you listening?

45:00.505 --> 45:02.625
HE TURNS THE HOOVER OFF

45:08.065 --> 45:09.612
What's going on with you?

45:10.305 --> 45:11.345
Oh...

45:12.345 --> 45:13.655
That, er...

45:13.945 --> 45:16.893
That French detective,
he called earlier.

45:17.323 --> 45:21.182
He said that he thinks somebody's
interfered with the DNA test.

45:21.207 --> 45:23.328
He thinks someone's swapped
the samples or something.

45:23.328 --> 45:25.408
- Slow...slow down.
- Maybe I was right.

45:25.408 --> 45:28.392
And maybe that girl living in
our house wasn't our daughter.

45:28.417 --> 45:29.725
And, you know, there's a chance,

45:29.725 --> 45:32.045
there's a chance that she's still
out there somewhere.

45:32.045 --> 45:32.635
No.

45:33.365 --> 45:35.164
- I'm not doing this, not again.
- No.

45:35.164 --> 45:36.764
He had pictures.

45:36.764 --> 45:39.044
He was talking about pictures
of a rollercoaster and...

45:39.044 --> 45:40.724
Do you know how you sound?

45:41.684 --> 45:44.018
You know, cos you've been asleep
at the wheel for this last year.

45:44.018 --> 45:45.418
You can hardly looked me in the eye.

45:46.457 --> 45:47.697
You think it's all your fault.

45:47.697 --> 45:49.676
You're punishing yourself
and you're punishing me.

45:49.676 --> 45:52.156
No. You talk to Baptiste.
Then you'll realise.

45:52.157 --> 45:53.958
Then you'll understand.

45:55.186 --> 45:57.066
We've been through all this, Gemma.

45:58.482 --> 45:59.842
What, so the police were wrong?

45:59.842 --> 46:01.776
That she was living in this house
all this time

46:01.776 --> 46:03.416
and she, what, was lying to us?

46:03.417 --> 46:05.617
- Why would she do something like that?
- I don't know.

46:05.617 --> 46:06.744
I don't know!

46:06.744 --> 46:08.464
But I do know
that something wasn't right.

46:08.464 --> 46:11.024
I said it, didn't I?
Didn't I, when she was here?

46:13.664 --> 46:15.144
You need help.

46:17.464 --> 46:18.784
Seriously.

46:21.062 --> 46:23.438
Because this isn't a way
to battle those demons

46:23.463 --> 46:25.223
running around in your head.

46:28.104 --> 46:29.744
This is sick.

46:38.674 --> 46:41.503
SHE RESTARTS THE HOOVER

46:50.648 --> 46:52.048
He looks like you.

46:53.018 --> 46:54.083
Your uncle.

46:54.543 --> 46:55.743
He was a shit.

46:56.562 --> 46:57.898
Leaving me that cabin

46:57.898 --> 47:00.642
was probably the only decent thing
he ever did for me.

47:08.359 --> 47:10.098
I look like a boy.

47:11.938 --> 47:13.458
You look beautiful.

47:15.054 --> 47:16.694
It makes you look younger.

47:21.658 --> 47:22.912
Why can't you come?

47:22.912 --> 47:25.632
I won't get my pension
unless I wait.

47:26.084 --> 47:27.844
This is what you wanted.

47:29.192 --> 47:30.912
To see the stars again.

47:30.912 --> 47:32.992
Isn't that what you always said
you wanted?

47:33.992 --> 47:36.232
But I don't know
why Lucy can't come with me.

47:36.549 --> 47:37.789
Don't...

47:37.789 --> 47:38.949
Don't you trust me?

47:38.949 --> 47:41.429
You earn my trust
when I say you have.

47:42.749 --> 47:44.149
You know that.

47:46.629 --> 47:47.989
Take this.

47:50.539 --> 47:52.459
Then you can have us there with you.

47:52.459 --> 47:53.499
Hm?

47:54.659 --> 47:56.619
Look, your face is all over
the papers.

47:56.619 --> 48:00.214
If we're going to find a proper way
to live, we have to do it right.

48:00.214 --> 48:02.615
And that means me trusting you
to do this.

48:03.934 --> 48:05.894
IN FRENCH:

48:09.713 --> 48:11.353
Don't do that.

48:11.353 --> 48:12.873
You know I hate it.

48:18.313 --> 48:19.353
Sorry.

48:26.353 --> 48:29.193
Matt, it's me. I'm here. I thought
we were supposed to be meeting.

48:32.073 --> 48:33.793
Obviously not.

48:42.273 --> 48:43.593
Hey.

48:43.593 --> 48:45.033
Can I have another one?

48:46.153 --> 48:47.833
You shouldn't really drink alone.

48:49.393 --> 48:51.353
Says the man drinking alone.

48:51.353 --> 48:54.633
Well, actually, I was supposed
to be meeting someone, so... Mm.

48:57.833 --> 49:00.393
I thought, when I joined the Army,
that'd be the end of all that,

49:00.393 --> 49:01.793
you know, being on my own.

49:01.793 --> 49:03.833
Joining a family of thousands.
Now look at me.

49:04.638 --> 49:06.393
You have a family.

49:06.393 --> 49:08.993
Yeah, well, they're a bit like
yours, you know, not all there.

49:15.193 --> 49:16.993
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. Sorry.

49:19.473 --> 49:21.393
So you heard about my dad, then?

49:24.033 --> 49:26.593
Nothing stays secret round here
for long, does it?

49:42.633 --> 49:44.633
SHE LAUGHS

49:46.073 --> 49:47.433
Oh!

49:47.433 --> 49:49.073
SHE LAUGHS

51:15.553 --> 51:18.113
IN GERMAN:

51:19.073 --> 51:20.553
Go on, Matty. Talk to him.

51:21.913 --> 51:24.153
What did you do to my sister?

51:25.193 --> 51:26.233
Go on.

51:26.662 --> 51:28.302
What did you do?

51:29.273 --> 51:31.273
I don't know where I am.

51:46.033 --> 51:47.513
Mrs Webster...

51:50.193 --> 51:52.873
..I was surprised to get your call.

51:55.473 --> 51:56.953
This is everything the Army had

51:56.953 --> 51:59.313
on Adrian Stone
and Henry Reed's unit.

52:01.993 --> 52:04.713
Everything that happened on the ops
they ran...

52:05.032 --> 52:07.152
during the Gulf War
should be in there.

52:08.233 --> 52:09.513
Thank you.

52:10.343 --> 52:13.315
I know this couldn't have been easy
to get hold of.

52:15.113 --> 52:17.793
How are you going to find
the third name Stone talked about,

52:17.793 --> 52:18.913
in all those names?

52:18.913 --> 52:21.593
Well, we'll start with those on tour
in this regiment.

52:21.593 --> 52:23.913
Those in Stone's own unit.

52:23.913 --> 52:26.033
Fellow officers that...

52:26.953 --> 52:28.073
..might have...

52:29.993 --> 52:31.193
What?

52:34.433 --> 52:35.953
What is it?

52:35.953 --> 52:38.633
This name. This is no coincidence.

52:39.833 --> 52:42.162
I am not done here, Mrs Webster.

52:42.187 --> 52:43.507
Thank you.

53:05.242 --> 53:06.522
Hey, Dad...

53:12.349 --> 53:13.749
What happened?

53:14.851 --> 53:16.374
You got hurt.

53:16.399 --> 53:18.156
HE GROANS
Dad, you have fractured ribs.

53:18.156 --> 53:20.476
Don't try and move.
You need to rest.

53:21.876 --> 53:24.272
- I don't know where I am.
- You're in hospital.

53:24.297 --> 53:27.257
- Don't try and get up, Dad.
- What's going on?

53:27.257 --> 53:28.857
Dad...
HE STRAINS

53:29.284 --> 53:31.392
IN GERMAN:

53:31.417 --> 53:33.497
- I want to go home!
- Lie back, please.

53:33.497 --> 53:36.589
You cannot go anywhere for now. No,
no, you don't tell me what to do!

53:37.143 --> 53:39.577
Dad, please, you need to rest.

53:39.577 --> 53:41.457
Look, they're just trying
to make you better.

53:41.457 --> 53:43.097
What are you talking about?
It's Eve.

53:43.097 --> 53:44.697
I want to go home.
HE SPEAKS IN GERMAN

53:44.697 --> 53:46.217
Get away from me!

53:46.217 --> 53:47.937
Leave me alone!

53:47.937 --> 53:49.377
I want to go home!

53:49.377 --> 53:50.537
I want to go home!

53:50.537 --> 53:52.857
- Calm down, sir.
- Leave me alone!

53:52.857 --> 53:54.297
Calm down, sir. Leave me alone!

53:54.297 --> 53:55.977
Sir, calm down. Get away from me!

53:55.977 --> 53:57.177
I want to go home!

53:59.497 --> 54:00.817
Everything's fine, sir.

54:00.817 --> 54:02.657
Thank you.
Everything's fine.

54:02.657 --> 54:04.017
Thank you.

54:04.017 --> 54:05.537
Calm down.

54:16.177 --> 54:17.857
Staff Sergeant Stone,

54:17.857 --> 54:19.417
I am sorry to disturb.

54:21.422 --> 54:25.371
I wanted you to know that I'll
be tackling this case personally.

54:27.052 --> 54:28.914
Your father and I
had our disagreements,

54:28.914 --> 54:31.552
but it was a loss to us all
when he had to step down.

54:31.834 --> 54:33.994
Do you have any idea who
might have done it?

54:34.654 --> 54:38.308
The French detective Baptiste
is back in Eckhausen again.

54:39.514 --> 54:43.676
Staff at your father's facility
say his last visitor was Baptiste.

54:43.824 --> 54:45.194
There was shouting

54:45.194 --> 54:47.114
and when the nurses ran in to help,

54:47.114 --> 54:49.274
Baptiste was attacking your father.

54:49.274 --> 54:50.714
Jesus...!

54:50.714 --> 54:54.874
You had dealings with him in 2014,
during the Webster business.

54:54.874 --> 54:57.886
- Do you think him capable of such
a thing? - No. But...

55:00.954 --> 55:03.709
He's not well.
He has a brain tumour.

55:04.554 --> 55:05.794
And yesterday...

55:06.914 --> 55:08.914
..he lost it in the Army cookhouse.

55:08.914 --> 55:10.474
He was hallucinating

55:10.474 --> 55:12.114
and he went for one of the men.

55:17.834 --> 55:20.234
PHONE RINGS

55:22.874 --> 55:24.474
Staff Sergeant Stone.

55:25.874 --> 55:27.234
'Where are you?'

55:27.234 --> 55:29.554
What does it matter? Only yesterday
you told me to go home.

55:30.634 --> 55:33.354
'You should come down to
the station and turn yourself in.'

55:33.354 --> 55:35.037
For what?

55:35.151 --> 55:37.031
For what you did to my dad.

55:37.592 --> 55:40.434
For putting him in hospital.
'Your father?

55:40.434 --> 55:42.754
'I did nothing of the sort,
Miss Stone.'

55:43.714 --> 55:46.296
'I don't blame you.
I just feel sad for you.

55:46.634 --> 55:47.999
'You're not well.'

55:48.140 --> 55:49.514
You're lost.

55:49.514 --> 55:51.234
'I am not lost.'

55:51.234 --> 55:53.499
I know exactly where I am!

56:52.034 --> 56:53.794
Mrs Herz...

57:02.594 --> 57:04.314
I didn't come here to harm you.

57:05.434 --> 57:07.201
My name is Julien Baptiste.

57:07.850 --> 57:09.874
I need to ask you some questions.

57:11.394 --> 57:14.376
- Get out of my house!
- I'm not going anywhere.

57:15.874 --> 57:17.954
Did you set him up, your husband?

57:17.954 --> 57:20.594
For the abduction of Alice Webster?

57:20.594 --> 57:23.040
Of Sophie Giroux? Was it you?

57:24.874 --> 57:26.714
I don't know what you're
talking about?

57:26.714 --> 57:29.666
I am talking about the reason all
of this began in the first place.

57:29.691 --> 57:33.051
Back in 1991,
for almost a month in Iraq,

57:33.051 --> 57:34.891
you were the ranking officer.

57:34.891 --> 57:37.731
Under your command
were Adrian Stone and Henry Reed.

57:39.371 --> 57:42.616
Something happened back then,
did it not?

57:42.641 --> 57:45.601
- I'm calling the police.
- You will do no such thing.

57:47.464 --> 57:49.586
I believe that finding out
the truth of what happened

57:49.586 --> 57:51.049
all those years ago in Iraq

57:51.074 --> 57:54.541
will help explain why
Alice Webster was taken.

57:54.963 --> 57:57.834
And more importantly,
who it was that took her.

57:58.914 --> 58:00.514
You think it was me?

58:00.514 --> 58:02.554
I think we don't have much time.

58:03.914 --> 58:05.274
All right...

58:08.234 --> 58:09.994
..I'll tell you what I know.
