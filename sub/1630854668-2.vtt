00:37.996 --> 00:39.831
<i>You deserve to know what I am.</i>

00:41.875 --> 00:42.709
<i>Why I'm here.</i>

00:44.419 --> 00:46.588
<i>Why I don't expect</i>
<i>to ever be anywhere else.</i>

00:53.803 --> 00:55.805
<i>Criminals come in all different flavors.</i>

00:58.058 --> 01:01.478
<i>No matter what kind you are,</i>
<i>you do it long enough, you fall.</i>

01:20.246 --> 01:23.666
<i>It don't stop us from thinking up new ways</i>
<i>to do the same old shit.</i>

01:40.934 --> 01:42.393
<i>We see a need and we fill it.</i>

01:44.270 --> 01:45.980
<i>A chance, and we take it.</i>

01:52.779 --> 01:54.239
<i>Toeing up to the line,</i>

01:55.115 --> 01:56.407
<i>knowing when the moment comes,</i>

01:57.450 --> 01:58.993
<i>we gonna jump right over it.</i>

02:17.303 --> 02:20.974
<i>When it works, it's magic.</i>

02:30.650 --> 02:31.568
How's it going?

02:32.193 --> 02:33.528
How's the oatmeal, good?

02:34.529 --> 02:36.906
It's actually a new kind of oatmeal,
with groats.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.202
<i>I made a choice.</i>

02:41.786 --> 02:44.497
Nuttier, fibrous.
It's good for you.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.249
Blow your mind.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.376
<i>I was betrayed.</i>

02:49.043 --> 02:50.003
Enjoy, guys.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.338
A lot of effort went into it.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.925
What's up, bro? How you doing? You good?

02:56.009 --> 02:56.843
Enjoying breakfast?

03:06.060 --> 03:06.978
What's up, man?

03:07.061 --> 03:10.023
-Hey, what's up? How you been?
-I'm great, man. How are you?

03:10.106 --> 03:11.357
Better now.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.736
Talk to you soon, all right?

03:14.819 --> 03:15.904
-Appreciate it.
-Cool.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.048
Good afternoon, ladies.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.093
Hello.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.555
Sorry, Stan. The pantry door was jammed.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.390
I think somebody took a hammer to it.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.185
Thomas Keller doesn't have
to deal with this bullshit.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.200
Once I get this garden up and going,

04:02.283 --> 04:04.202
we are going farm-to-table up in here.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.426
What's up, gents? How are you doing?

04:22.679 --> 04:26.182
That is no Sabatier, but it is very sharp,
so just be…

04:26.266 --> 04:29.018
Be careful. Be careful. Please.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.856
Is that my phone minutes
you were selling to the spooks?

04:33.940 --> 04:37.110
It's all one love, brother.
There's plenty of them to go around.

04:37.735 --> 04:40.321
Now, you look like someone
who has a refined palate,

04:40.405 --> 04:42.740
so why don't you
taste that carrot ginger soup?

04:42.824 --> 04:44.993
It is a cold soup like-- Oh, fuck!

04:45.076 --> 04:47.036
You do business with your own.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.958
And anything you get,
you bring to the Peckerwoods.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.294
Have we discussed your gang name because--

04:56.212 --> 04:57.213
Fuck.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.591
Is there a problem here?

05:02.510 --> 05:03.970
Yeah, and it ain't yours.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.722
Except that's my cellie.

05:07.181 --> 05:10.935
You beat on him,
he's gonna be moaning about it all night.

05:11.019 --> 05:15.023
It'll fuck with my sleep,
then I get cranky.

05:15.106 --> 05:19.360
I'm recommending
you walk the fuck out of here or kill him.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.696
-Then I don't have to hear about it.
-Hmm.

05:21.779 --> 05:25.533
Hey, hey, he-- he's joking.
You know, he's a very funny guy.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.265
Fuck him.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.100
Ow.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.644
You all right?

05:54.604 --> 05:56.731
Yeah, man, I'm all right. Thank you.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.195
Hey, maybe next time
show up a little quicker, huh?

06:03.571 --> 06:06.407
I do that, and you'll never learn.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.707
-Booyah.
-Yeah.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.378
-Yeah, baby, yeah.
-Right?

06:31.182 --> 06:32.141
I've been thinking…

06:33.267 --> 06:35.853
After everything Judy's been doing for me,

06:35.937 --> 06:37.730
I ought to do what's right, you know?

06:38.815 --> 06:43.069
So, I got this friend Choi
who runs the kiss cam for the Mets.

06:43.152 --> 06:46.614
I'm thinking I take her to a game,
seventh inning stretch and boom!

06:47.448 --> 06:48.866
Pose on the Jumbotron, man.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.119
And as she is losing her goddamn mind,

06:51.786 --> 06:53.704
a hot dog vendor working our section

06:53.788 --> 06:56.958
throws her a foot-long with the ring
on it. What you think?

06:58.126 --> 06:59.877
How long have you known this girl?

06:59.961 --> 07:02.171
It's not about time, man.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.089
I mean…

07:04.715 --> 07:05.633
Judy…

07:07.635 --> 07:08.594
she's the one.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.430
God bless.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.889
Hey, you got my Dumas?

07:15.017 --> 07:16.394
Just don't forget our deal.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.439
Hey, no, you got it.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.822
-Damn.

07:39.667 --> 07:40.835
Hey, y'alright?

07:42.420 --> 07:44.213
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.842
Let me take over for a little bit.
I got this. Don't worry about it.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.135
-Thanks, man.
-All right.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.439
Hmm.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.073
Lights out.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.635
Hey, Ray. I'm trying to sleep, man.
Shut up.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.720
-Ray. Hey.

08:34.555 --> 08:37.808
Ray. Hey. Hey, Ray, wake up, man.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.395
Wake up, man, wake up!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.065
You okay? Hey. Look at me.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.278
We're trading bunks.

08:53.783 --> 08:57.203
Your vitals are good, Mr. Vernon.
How are you feeling today?

08:57.286 --> 08:59.539
Like I've been in prison 17 years.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.791
I called Dr. Wagner. He's coming in.

09:03.000 --> 09:03.834
Ugh!

09:03.918 --> 09:06.337
Heaven forbid
anything should work in this place.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.297
-Shout when he's done.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.215
Yeah.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.976
So, I thought it's our anniversary.

09:20.059 --> 09:23.062
I mean, it… it depends
on when you start counting,

09:23.145 --> 09:26.023
but I like to think the first date

09:26.107 --> 09:28.818
was when I first saw you
working at the pharmacy.

09:29.777 --> 09:30.820
It's, um…

09:31.946 --> 09:33.114
It's super detailed.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.825
Ray is an Irish Spring Michelangelo.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.248
We've got to talk some shop, okay?

09:45.835 --> 09:50.339
Mickey kicked oxy, which, you know,
fucking great for him, I guess,

09:50.423 --> 09:53.968
but, uh, it means no more SIM cards.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.471
That's okay. Uh, we pay him cash.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.641
-It cuts into our margins a little--
-No, Stan. He…

10:01.934 --> 10:04.854
He told his boss he stole the cards.
He's out.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.064
They fired him on the spot.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.109
I'm sorry.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.156
I got guys in here
who are expecting cards.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.578
They aren't patient.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.553
Good morning, gentlemen. How are you?

11:00.242 --> 11:02.578
Hey, Ray. How are you doing, man?

11:02.662 --> 11:03.496
Hey, Doc.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.461
So, Nurse Clemmons gave me the rundown,

11:10.544 --> 11:12.546
but why don't you tell me what happened?

11:13.255 --> 11:14.715
Me and the floor had a disagreement.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.842
And you lost, huh?

11:16.926 --> 11:19.929
Well, I got the results
from your blood work here

11:20.012 --> 11:21.097
and the good news is

11:21.931 --> 11:25.142
you're in excellent health
for a man your age and situation.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.103
But?

11:27.186 --> 11:28.646
Well, the symptoms

11:28.729 --> 11:31.899
you've been talking to me about
for the last couple of months,

11:31.982 --> 11:34.944
the stiffness in the limbs,
the hand tremors,

11:35.027 --> 11:37.905
the difficulty sleeping and now this,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.491
taken together, they are concerning.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.662
There's no specific way to test for it,

11:45.705 --> 11:47.623
but we should talk about Parkinson's.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.546
We don't really know how it gets started,
what causes it…

11:53.629 --> 11:57.091
Well, we do when you die,
it's… controversial.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.686
Yo. What's the haps, man? Up high.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.855
-Come on, man, give me some skin.
-Enough.

12:12.565 --> 12:16.110
Enough?
I am Mr. Businessman. Enough.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.626
You looking to score all this?

12:35.671 --> 12:36.881
Nylons and lube.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.009
Hey, man, I support you.
Live your best life.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.514
-Are you trying to rabbit?
-Keep your voice down.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.392
Nylons for the poly to make rope

12:48.476 --> 12:50.853
and lube is to squeeze
through some fucking tunnel.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.397
Jesus Christ, Ray,
that's fucking insane, man.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.149
Hope's insane.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.819
Keeping my head down 17 years,

12:59.528 --> 13:01.864
expecting it's gonna
make a lick of difference.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.699
That's insane.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.203
This is me thinking clearly.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.248
Who kept you fed, little fish?

13:12.666 --> 13:16.086
You did, man,
and I owe you for that forever.

13:17.546 --> 13:20.549
But you get out
using a bunch of smuggled gear,

13:21.967 --> 13:24.887
I got guards on the take,
but they ain't gonna turn away from this,

13:24.970 --> 13:26.764
all fingers point right back at me.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.307
So come along.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.144
I got six months left.

13:33.270 --> 13:36.732
I get busted trying to self-parole,
that's another dime at least.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.485
I get it, man, I do, but…

13:41.028 --> 13:43.280
I can't. I'm sorry.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.308
You ready to get out of here?

14:11.392 --> 14:13.644
-Hey, man. Yeah, man, let's go.
-Let's go.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.944
Go ahead.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.200
Pat down broad
couldn't keep her hands off my shit.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.911
Don't worry, she's ugly anyway. 'Sup?

14:30.995 --> 14:33.038
Hey, man. I'm Stan. Nice to meet you.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.749
Yeah, Judy told me about your operation.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.126
I get it. I do.

14:37.209 --> 14:42.590
But, um, I gotta tell you, man,
this SIM card shit, it's bush league.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.968
Uh, all due respect, Bob,

14:46.468 --> 14:49.638
I'm not sure you do get it
because those cards are gold in here.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.933
If you want to stack real cheddar,
and I think you do,

14:53.017 --> 14:54.810
then you gotta move real product.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.022
I can get you weed, I'll get you coke,
the best fucking molly--

14:58.105 --> 15:00.691
No, man. I don't--
I don't sling. I've got my lane.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.110
Yeah? What's that, the slow lane?

15:07.573 --> 15:11.118
You must have a big fat hog down there
or something, Stanley, huh?

15:12.536 --> 15:14.997
You must. Because this, I don't see it.

15:15.789 --> 15:18.834
-Fuck you.
-Hey, Stan. Stan. Stan. Stan.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.419
-Hey, he's kidding.
-Fuck you.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.546
Ah, all right, settle down, princess.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.634
You'll get your little cards.
Uncle Bob will take care of you.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.262
Hey, time's up, Loomis.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.557
Hey. I said time's up.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.272
I'll come back in a couple weeks.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.441
Let's get out of here.

15:50.741 --> 15:51.659
I'm in.

15:53.953 --> 15:54.787
You sure?

15:54.870 --> 15:56.747
If I spend another six months
in this place,

15:56.830 --> 15:59.667
I'll lose everything good I got
waiting for me on the outside.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.713
Let's be honest. You need me.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.390
-All right.
-All right.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.600
You gotta forget
about the nylons and lube.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.895
What we need is a proper distraction.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.231
This is a magic mushroom.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.109
I grow them for Harold
and the other Navajos.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.443
It's purely sacramental.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.738
Yeah, it don't look so magical to me.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.908
You're gonna feel differently
when it helps us disappear from here.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.454
So what next?

16:39.331 --> 16:41.041
We gotta do some work in the garden.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.490
Son of a bitch.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.410
Damn. What is she, '71?

17:17.161 --> 17:19.288
'72. God damn it.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.542
You don't see them around much anymore.

17:24.668 --> 17:26.795
Hey, I could fix that glass for you.

17:26.879 --> 17:27.963
What? How?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.381
Down at the body shop.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.217
Me and my guys,
we could fix it for you for free.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.802
Least I could do.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.888
You're not jerking my chain?

17:37.139 --> 17:38.223
I do good work.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.019
Think about it. You know where to find me.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.273
Cool.

18:00.496 --> 18:04.875
Hey. Hey, man. Hey.
Jesus, Vernon, come on. You okay?

18:06.710 --> 18:07.753
Yeah, I'm okay.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.422
Oh, it's gotta be the damn drugs, man.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.382
Shit, man.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.418
-How's it going? Good?
-Yeah.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.088
You season this, Najimy?

18:51.839 --> 18:52.923
It's oatmeal.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.469
No, it's breakfast.
The most important meal of the day.

18:58.762 --> 19:01.557
Uh, get some honey.
We're going to sweeten this up.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.975
No. We're out of honey.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.435
Well, you're the beekeeper, man.
Make some more.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.938
-How about, uh, beet sugar?
-Fantastic.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.132
Someone take me to medical.
I need to get my IV.

19:46.560 --> 19:50.689
Yo! What, are you waiting for me
to say pretty please, fuckface?

19:50.772 --> 19:51.732
No, sir.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.651
Make sure that you have
an extra helping here.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.986
Sorry about that.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.576
All right.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.287
For my friends
with the delightful face tattoos,

20:05.370 --> 20:06.413
here's some for you.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.666
You want me to wait around?

20:09.750 --> 20:11.460
Up to you. He's gonna be a while.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.212
Music to my ears.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.668
Yo, Stanny.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.836
I'm a peacock.

20:56.797 --> 20:57.714
Peacock.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.054
You're welcome, everybody.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.056
Okay.

21:09.726 --> 21:11.979
Ah. Come on. Come on.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.522
-Come on, Stan.

21:14.606 --> 21:15.607
Let's go, come on.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.986
Ah! Ah!

21:23.448 --> 21:24.825
Fuck! Ah!

21:32.332 --> 21:33.417
What happened to you?

21:33.500 --> 21:35.168
I finally got my period.

21:36.586 --> 21:37.421
Hey, careful.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.007
That is a delicate instrument
you are manhandling there.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.925
You're going to need butterfly stitches.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.885
Take a seat and try not to annoy anyone.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.179
Yeah. Good luck.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.182
Clemmons here.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.892
<i>We have a situation in the mess.</i>

22:32.517 --> 22:33.518
Somebody sick?

22:33.602 --> 22:35.354
<i>It's hard to explain. Uh…</i>

22:35.437 --> 22:37.481
<i>Warden wants you</i>
<i>to get your people down here ASAP.</i>

22:37.564 --> 22:41.109
We're on our way.
Grab a kit and crash cart just in case.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.110
What about them?

22:42.194 --> 22:43.820
No, they're not going anywhere.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.079
Holy fucking shit, man, that worked.

23:10.722 --> 23:11.556
What the…

23:11.640 --> 23:13.850
Hey. Hey, sit down. Stop!

23:14.601 --> 23:15.769
Watch out! Get down!

23:15.852 --> 23:17.604
Get down from there. Stop it!

23:17.687 --> 23:19.398
Everybody stop! What…

23:20.357 --> 23:23.693
Whatever they're on, I want it found now!

23:30.200 --> 23:32.577
We're in. We good, we good, we good.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.547
Got it. Okay.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.589
On the other hand.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.134
Maybe we should just slow down
for a minute?

23:47.217 --> 23:48.135
Slow down…

23:50.595 --> 23:54.307
Oh, come on. Make up your mind,
little fish. Are you in or you out?

23:54.891 --> 23:56.601
You gonna let him have his way with her?

23:57.185 --> 23:58.019
-No.
-It's cool.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.856
No. No, no. I'm in.
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

24:02.607 --> 24:03.442
Got it.

24:29.342 --> 24:31.011
I can't believe that shit worked.

24:31.803 --> 24:32.971
<i>Popular Mechanics.</i>

24:53.158 --> 24:55.702
-Are you sure you copied the right one?
-Yeah.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.873
-Man, jiggle it.
-No! You break it, we're done for.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.249
You said you had this.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.668
You said you'd get the doors
if I got the oatmeal.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.462
Come on. Come on, Ray, let's go.

25:05.545 --> 25:06.880
Come on, man, come on.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.508
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.510
Get back-- What are you doing?

25:11.927 --> 25:14.763
This is a lockdown.
Everybody back in their cells.

25:14.846 --> 25:17.474
Josh, take left.
Nick, take right, to the infirmary.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.518
Everyone back in their cells right now.

25:20.435 --> 25:22.896
-This is a lockdown.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.899
Check all the hallways and meet back here.

25:25.982 --> 25:27.567
Everybody in their cells.

25:27.651 --> 25:31.154
Officer! I am so glad you're here.
I'm completely lost.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.948
Inmate. Get him back to his cell.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.241
What the fuck you doing?

25:34.324 --> 25:35.450
Go.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.370
Inmate, you are out of bounds.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.914
I know.
There's a left turn and another left turn.

25:40.997 --> 25:43.375
And you know this place,
it's confusing as hell.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.376
Whoa!

25:45.001 --> 25:48.713
We can negotiate on the rough stuff,
but buy a guy a drink first, you know?

26:30.005 --> 26:34.426
Oh, yeah. Mushrooms, definitely.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.096
There's really no cure except time.

26:38.179 --> 26:42.225
Oh, but you could cut up
some orange slices and pass them around.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.019
Oranges?

26:44.102 --> 26:47.022
Yeah, and maybe a little Pink Floyd.
That'd be cool.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.650
They should all back in three hours or so.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.528
I'm sure Nurse Clemmons
will give me a ring

26:53.612 --> 26:56.656
if anything really weird happens.

27:08.251 --> 27:09.085
Okay.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.436
Ava, how are you?

29:32.145 --> 29:32.979
Uh…

29:34.564 --> 29:37.859
I'm a little disappointed.

29:39.819 --> 29:41.821
Kind of hoping I'd get to shoot someone.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.617
Well, thank you for holding back.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.536
Ah, the night's young.

29:51.247 --> 29:53.041
I hate your clothes.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.835
-I got them cheap.
-Yeah.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.463
-Is this Pepper?

30:00.298 --> 30:02.759
How long do you think dogs live, Ray?

30:10.934 --> 30:11.768
Mmm.

30:13.978 --> 30:17.732
I assume there's a good reason
you're not in prison.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.902
I mean, apart from being an idiot.

30:30.119 --> 30:31.037
How long?

30:31.746 --> 30:32.747
Two years, maybe…

30:33.873 --> 30:34.707
ten.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.378
There's no way to know.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.505
Well, I…

30:41.756 --> 30:43.383
I feel fine most days.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.848
And now what? Run for the border?

30:51.140 --> 30:52.851
I got some places in mind.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.979
I suppose you need money.

30:56.062 --> 30:57.230
I dug up an old friend.

31:08.491 --> 31:09.325
Hmm.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.121
I can get you out of the country.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.248
When do you wanna leave?

31:15.999 --> 31:17.250
After I see Hannah.

31:19.919 --> 31:20.837
No.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.338
My daughter needs to see me.

31:22.422 --> 31:26.384
No, she doesn't need that.
Your conscience does.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.178
Oh.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.388
Man, what do you care?

31:31.639 --> 31:34.934
You told me to find her
a new family. Remember?

31:35.935 --> 31:37.103
She's good, Ray.

31:39.063 --> 31:43.902
And now you… you want to
toss a grenade into all that.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.653
I don't expect her to forgive me.

31:47.906 --> 31:52.577
But I'm not going to crawl off and die
without telling her why I did what I did.

31:52.660 --> 31:53.745
And then leave again?

31:56.039 --> 31:58.041
You think that's going to
make things any better?

31:58.124 --> 32:00.585
Look, I don't know what I think.
All right?

32:01.669 --> 32:04.672
I just… I need to see her

32:04.756 --> 32:07.342
and I thought that you of all people
would get that.

32:12.263 --> 32:16.100
<i>Okay. Hannah's last name now is Kim.</i>

32:16.768 --> 32:18.853
<i>She's working in high-tech security.</i>

32:19.771 --> 32:21.773
<i>From what I hear, she's doing well.</i>

32:22.857 --> 32:24.484
<i>Try not to fuck that up.</i>

32:24.567 --> 32:27.153
I'd say you're
getting the hang of things just fine.

32:27.236 --> 32:31.407
Well, I'm definitely still learning a lot
from Andrew, from you.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.451
You've taught me so much.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.411
Not everyone picks things up so fast.

32:35.995 --> 32:37.872
No, I, uh… I recruit for a reason.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.999
When it pays off, it pays off.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.752
There's gonna be opportunity for growth

32:42.835 --> 32:45.463
in the next couple of years
as I've built up the vault.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.799
Whatever you need from me, sir, I'm game.

32:47.882 --> 32:49.217
That's the right attitude.

33:01.646 --> 33:04.107
Welcome back, Abbasi.
You missed us?

33:04.190 --> 33:05.441
Not even a little bit.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.610
-You got any baby pics?
-Only about a thousand.

33:07.694 --> 33:10.697
-How long have you treated him?
-Since I started…

33:10.780 --> 33:12.782
Oh, you mean for the Parkinson's.

33:12.865 --> 33:14.075
A month, more or less.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.496
Would you say he seemed upset
by his diagnosis?

33:18.579 --> 33:19.497
Well, it's a…

33:19.998 --> 33:23.042
It's an incurable terminal illness,
so, yeah, I'd say so.

33:23.126 --> 33:25.211
So you consider yourself sympathetic.

33:26.629 --> 33:30.133
Not enough to have helped him escape,
if that's what you're driving at.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.385
What the fuck? Are you kidding me?

33:34.929 --> 33:36.055
It's just a question.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.558
What kind of a question is that?

33:38.641 --> 33:40.935
I'm the victim here. He stole my car.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.687
He pulled one over on me.

33:42.770 --> 33:45.565
-I just can't believe this happened.
-I apologize, sir.

33:45.648 --> 33:47.859
I've known
this man for ten years. It's…

33:52.780 --> 33:53.614
I trusted him.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.199
I understand. He used you.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.289
Hey, squirrel.

34:10.298 --> 34:12.133
I know. I… I know.

34:14.927 --> 34:18.139
Can we talk? For a minute?

34:20.892 --> 34:21.893
That's all I ask.

34:32.653 --> 34:33.863
Seventeen years.

34:36.532 --> 34:39.035
I've had 17 years
to rehearse this damned speech.

34:43.247 --> 34:45.833
I just never imagined

34:47.460 --> 34:50.421
you'd be so grown up, so beautiful.

34:51.756 --> 34:55.593
You know, in my mind,
you're still my baby girl.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.515
Your mother used to say I was

35:00.598 --> 35:02.683
better when I said less
and she was right--

35:02.767 --> 35:04.811
You don't get to talk about her.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.480
Not after what you did.

35:08.898 --> 35:09.732
I'm sorry.

35:10.691 --> 35:11.901
You're right. I just--

35:11.984 --> 35:13.820
-I don't want anything from you.
-Wait.

35:13.903 --> 35:16.030
You left me.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.159
You sent me away when I needed you.
What kind of father does that?

35:20.243 --> 35:22.370
-I was trying to protect you.
-From what?

35:22.453 --> 35:23.287
From me.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.039
From who I was.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.916
I didn't want you to end up like me.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.210
I tried to come and see you.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.214
When I was 13.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.300
Yeah, I… I ditched school.

35:37.009 --> 35:38.886
Rode my bike to the bus station.

35:40.054 --> 35:42.723
Sold it to some Boy Scouts
so I could buy a ticket.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.894
And I was so excited.

35:49.605 --> 35:51.774
And you know what happened
when I got there?

35:54.068 --> 35:57.155
When I got there, they told me
that you didn't want to see me.

35:59.282 --> 36:02.702
Like I didn't mean anything to you.
Like I was trash.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.538
You needed to have a life.

36:06.622 --> 36:08.040
A good life.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.917
And that meant forgetting about me.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.462
Well, it worked.

36:14.213 --> 36:15.256
I forgot you.

36:15.756 --> 36:17.341
-And I'm gonna do it again.
-Hannah!

36:18.926 --> 36:22.096
Hannah, please just listen to me.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.807
Hannah.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.320
-Hey.
-Hi.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.595
<i>When was the last time</i>
<i>you saw Ray Vernon?</i>

37:03.346 --> 37:04.305
Uh…

37:04.388 --> 37:06.724
Not since I visited him in March.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.060
What was the purpose of that visit?

37:10.770 --> 37:13.689
He wanted me to get him
transferred to another facility.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.817
Was he tired of the view?

37:18.069 --> 37:19.820
He thought his life was in danger.

37:21.530 --> 37:22.740
What kind of danger?

37:24.075 --> 37:28.412
He was being targeted by
a white supremacist prison gang.

37:34.043 --> 37:37.296
You're saying Vernon broke out of prison
after 17 years

37:37.380 --> 37:39.382
because he was afraid of some skinheads?

37:40.049 --> 37:41.384
Do you think that's funny?

37:41.467 --> 37:43.052
I think it's convenient.

37:44.845 --> 37:49.892
The Peckerwoods are gun dealers,
human traffickers.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.979
They move drugs in and out of prisons
all across the country.

37:53.562 --> 37:55.439
Uh, but, um…

37:57.566 --> 38:00.778
I don't have to tell you
about drugs, do I?

38:02.697 --> 38:05.199
-What did you just say to me?
-Okay, that's enough.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.327
I'm telling you my client
feared for his life and you laugh,

38:09.370 --> 38:12.498
which means either
you are not taking this case seriously

38:12.581 --> 38:15.126
or I shouldn't take you seriously.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.671
Either way, this interview is over.

38:20.589 --> 38:21.632
Thank you for your time.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.010
Come on, let's go.

38:26.095 --> 38:28.139
You need to get your shit together.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.997
We found Dr. Wagner's car. Unknown body.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.665
Fire department's on its way.

39:05.217 --> 39:06.552
<i>According to authorities,</i>

39:06.635 --> 39:10.139
the corpse found shot and burned
last night in West Nyack

39:10.723 --> 39:13.893
belonged to Ray Vernon, escaped prisoner.

39:15.144 --> 39:18.314
It helps you got a friend who
can switch dental records with a corpse.

39:19.106 --> 39:21.984
A friend with a friend who has a friend.

39:25.738 --> 39:28.532
What about the fed?
Am I gonna have problems there?

39:29.116 --> 39:30.117
Let me handle her.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.581
I appreciate it, Ava. I won't forget it.

39:42.463 --> 39:45.841
-You're not leaving, are you?
-I can't. Not yet.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.927
I know you think you can't.

39:48.010 --> 39:49.178
He has Hannah.

39:49.261 --> 39:51.639
-He recruited her out of college.
-Working for him.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.849
-Smiling at him.
-I don't know how he found her.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.602
How could you let that happen?
You know what he did to me.

39:57.311 --> 40:01.148
You told me to help her start over,
not track her every move.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.943
I have a life. She has hers.

40:04.610 --> 40:06.070
Does she even know who he is?

40:06.612 --> 40:09.573
What his real name is?
Not this Roger Salas bullshit.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.283
I can't imagine how she could.

40:13.577 --> 40:15.204
He… He took everything from me.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.332
He doesn't get her too.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.544
-Leo Pap, huh?
-Mmm-hmm.

41:03.627 --> 41:06.213
Died as a child in 1970.

41:09.133 --> 41:13.762
We'll get you a passport,
driver's license, everything you need.

41:13.846 --> 41:16.640
It's not enough to say you're Leo Pap.

41:17.266 --> 41:20.811
You need to be Leo Pap
from this day forward.

41:24.148 --> 41:24.982
Okay.

41:26.901 --> 41:31.363
<i>Dear Hannah, I tried to write</i>
<i>this letter for the last 17 years,</i>

41:31.447 --> 41:34.825
<i>and for the last 17 years,</i>
<i>I couldn't do it</i>

41:35.534 --> 41:37.036
<i>because I didn't know how to start.</i>

41:37.703 --> 41:38.704
<i>But now I do.</i>

41:44.210 --> 41:45.211
<i>I love you…</i>

41:46.086 --> 41:47.922
<i>from the day you were born.</i>

41:48.005 --> 41:50.925
<i>And I lied to you</i>
<i>from the day you were born.</i>

41:52.051 --> 41:54.428
<i>But there are other lies</i>
<i>you need to know about.</i>

41:54.970 --> 41:58.182
<i>Other liars all around</i>
<i>looking down on you with a smile,</i>

41:58.265 --> 42:00.518
<i>pretending all is all right</i>
<i>with the world.</i>

42:01.894 --> 42:03.604
<i>There are mistakes I need to fix.</i>

42:04.438 --> 42:06.148
<i>Things you need to know</i>

42:06.232 --> 42:08.234
<i>and people who need to pay.</i>

42:09.151 --> 42:11.487
<i>And it all starts with Roger Salas.</i>

42:12.488 --> 42:14.073
<i>He's not what you think he is.</i>

42:20.412 --> 42:23.457
<i>All ain't all right with the world,</i>
<i>not by a long shot.</i>

42:24.708 --> 42:27.711
<i>So we got to stand up straight</i>
<i>and make it right.</i>

42:29.129 --> 42:32.800
<i>You and me, Squirrel. That's all it takes.</i>
