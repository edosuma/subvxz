00:02.211 --> 00:03.545
Previously on Gilmore girls:

00:03.629 --> 00:06.006
You should walk down the aisle
to Frank Sinatra...

00:06.089 --> 00:08.258
with a huge bouquet of something
that smells good.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.343
Pot roast.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.303
Max has asked me to marry him.

00:11.386 --> 00:12.471
Yeah, I figured.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.015
I haven't made my mind up
about the 'yes' or 'no' part.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.225
Where are you gonna live?

00:16.308 --> 00:17.267
- What?
- Here? Hartford?

00:17.351 --> 00:18.310
Where are we gonna live?

00:18.352 --> 00:19.728
Where are we going to live?

00:19.811 --> 00:21.855
- You're going to have more kids?
- Personal.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.398
I mean, he wants kids, right?

00:23.482 --> 00:24.733
- Are you saying yes?
- What?

00:24.816 --> 00:26.276
Are you saying yes?

00:29.446 --> 00:32.741
He asked me to marry him and I said yes.
I'm getting married.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.076
Well, I think that's very nice.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.328
- Yep.
- Yep what?

00:36.411 --> 00:38.830
There's nothing like a wedding
to screw up a family.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.667
There's nothing like a family
to screw up a family.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.336
You're throwing me
a wedding shower, aren't you?

00:44.419 --> 00:48.465
It's a big night for me tonight,
and it feels like you should be there.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.384
- I'll see how it goes.
- Okay.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

00:59.726 --> 01:01.520
I'm getting married.

01:02.938 --> 01:04.147
Oh, my God, here.

01:04.230 --> 01:07.025
Wow, go with a crunch and a zing and a...

01:07.901 --> 01:08.944
Hello!

01:09.027 --> 01:12.489
Our house is burning and you can save
the cake or me. What do you choose?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.449
That's not fair. The cake doesn't have legs.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.285
So how are we coming here?

01:16.368 --> 01:19.246
- Fran, so good. This cake is amazing.
- Beyond amazing.

01:19.329 --> 01:23.625
I should hope so.
We've been doing this for 112 years.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.170
You don't look a day over 106.

01:26.420 --> 01:30.549
No, I meant my family's been doing it
for that long.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.758
Right. Okay.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.803
- I'm glad we got that cleared up.
- The raspberries.

01:34.887 --> 01:38.182
- So when is the big day again?
- Two weeks from tomorrow.

01:38.265 --> 01:41.768
- Have you picked a flavor?
- I don't know. They're all so good.

01:41.852 --> 01:46.565
- You have to try them again.
- No, I've already eaten so many.

01:46.607 --> 01:50.444
This is a very crucial decision, young lady.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.863
Cake is the glue of the wedding...

01:52.946 --> 01:56.325
so you will stand here
and eat until you decide.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.869
- Okay, if you insist.
- I do.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.955
After all, what's more important
than your wedding day?

02:02.039 --> 02:05.667
- It ain't Guy Fawkes Day.
- Yes.

02:05.751 --> 02:09.588
I'll just go and see
if there's anything else in the back.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.631
Thanks.

02:10.756 --> 02:14.218
How was it seeing Max last night?
No gory details.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.386
Like I've ever shared that part with you.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.554
You've alluded...

02:17.638 --> 02:21.058
you've insinuated, you have
tiptoed to the brink of impropriety.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.353
- Chilton has taught you some big words.
- That's kind of the point.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.146
It was really great. I'm glad he's back.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.148
He's on board
with the small wedding thing?

02:28.232 --> 02:31.151
Yeah, we want fun, we want simple,
we want fast.

02:31.235 --> 02:35.030
We've been completely in sync, without
that slightly gay, boy-band affiliation.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.658
I printed up some sample invitations
for you.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.826
I made them on my computer.

02:39.952 --> 02:43.539
All you have to do is pick out a quote
for the front page...

02:43.622 --> 02:45.833
- and I'll print them up.
- Okay.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.921
'What is love?
It is the morning and the evening star. '

02:52.130 --> 02:53.924
- Sinclair Lewis.
- Sinclair 'Sappy' Lewis.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.092
Fine, next.

02:55.384 --> 02:58.136
'And all went merry as a marriage bell.
But hush! Hark!

02:58.220 --> 03:01.139
'A deep sound strikes like a rising knell!'

03:01.849 --> 03:03.100
What is it with poetry?

03:03.183 --> 03:05.394
- Lord Byron.
- Byron and Lewis, together again.

03:05.477 --> 03:06.979
Okay, last one.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.815
'We have buried
the putrid corpse of liberty. '

03:09.898 --> 03:12.234
- Perfect.
- Mussolini it is.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.820
Can I ask you an ethical question?

03:14.903 --> 03:18.574
Is it right to be sampling wedding cakes
when Sookie's making yours for free?

03:18.657 --> 03:22.286
What is right, anyway? Who defines right?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.830
And if eating cake is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.833
I'm bringing out a Mocha Crunch Creme.

03:28.584 --> 03:29.626
So, ethics?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.670
Highly subjective
and completely overrated.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.005
That's my girl.

04:28.352 --> 04:31.230
And here's a sample
of some of my black-and-white shots.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.273
Kirk, I didn't know you were
into photography.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.358
It's my passion.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.110
- Ever shot a wedding before?
- This would be my first...

04:37.194 --> 04:39.988
official wedding gig, or photography gig,
for that matter.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.908
But I've got the eye,
and my Nikon is state-of-the-art.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.284
I've got a Nikon, too.

04:44.368 --> 04:47.746
It's an N64 with 3-D matrix metering,
35 to 210 zoom.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.666
- What have you got?
- It's a Nikon.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.211
I got to tell you,
these are really good for amateur shots.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.965
Thanks. That's me and my parents
on vacation in the Berkshires.

04:58.048 --> 05:01.552
- Nice-looking family.
- And those are some self portraits.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.429
Kirk, you're nude.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.974
No, I'm wearing Speedos.
They're flesh-colored.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.352
- Wait a minute. I recognize this.
- Nice photo, huh?

05:11.436 --> 05:14.398
This is V-J Day. New York, 1945.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.943
I include it as an example
of the excellence I aspire to.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.404
- How much for your services?
- How about $150 an hour?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.281
How about lunch and the cost of the film?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.366
- You won't be sorry.
- Done.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.827
- I thank you.
- Bye.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.372
- What time is it?
- 10:00...

05:30.455 --> 05:31.623
10:00 of?

05:31.665 --> 05:32.666
- Three.
- I have to go.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.751
- No! You're always going.
- I have to.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.546
- Luckily, that'll all change soon.
- Yes, it will.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.464
Two weeks from now,
you won't have to go...

05:39.548 --> 05:41.425
'cause it's here you'll be going to.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.302
- Going or going to?
- I'd add the 'to. '

05:43.385 --> 05:45.637
Going to. You make me smarter.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.307
- I am a teacher.
- Hey, don't. Stay longer.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.433
I can't.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.977
Take me upstairs
and see if you can get me into Mensa.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.854
It'll take me forever to get back...

05:53.937 --> 05:56.481
and I gotta get up early
and let the painters in.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.359
- Do you have to be there while they work?
- What do you mean?

05:59.443 --> 06:01.653
Isn't your apartment gonna be
all paint fumy?

06:01.737 --> 06:04.781
- Yeah, so?
- So maybe you should stay here.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.533
- Here?
- Yeah.

06:06.617 --> 06:10.204
Instead of driving back and forth
all weekend, sleep over.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.664
It's gonna be your place, too, soon enough.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.082
Look at it like a trial run.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.502
- A trial run?
- It'll be fun.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.464
- You think you're ready for me?
- I'm always ready for you.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.925
- Full time?
- I insist.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.637
He was not wearing Speedos.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.306
- Don't talk about the photo.
- The man was buck-naked.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.767
Offer rescinded
if this conversation proceeds.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.852
- I'll be back.
- Bye, honey.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.107
- So what are we doing tonight?
- I'll do whatever.

06:39.191 --> 06:42.319
- What movies haven't we seen?
- Just about all of them.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.654
They all stink this year.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.948
They definitely do underestimate
our intelligence.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.033
- Plus they stink.
- There are at least five...

06:48.116 --> 06:50.661
featuring someone doing
something disgusting with a cow.

06:50.744 --> 06:54.039
They should at least do something
disgusting with a different animal.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.375
We could watch Holy Grail on tape again.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.795
Okay, but I am not talking
in an English accent all evening.

06:59.878 --> 07:03.048
- No fun. Hey, tomorrow night...
- Life of Brian?

07:03.131 --> 07:04.132
Max is staying over.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.968
- Really?
- First time.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.972
And to kind of celebrate, he and Mom
wanted to go on a double date.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.557
But tomorrow's our anniversary.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.601
- No, it's not. It's on the 24th.
- That was our old anniversary.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.770
We broke up,
and got back together on the 6th...

07:16.854 --> 07:20.691
so using the 24th wouldn't be an accurate
count of how long we've been together.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.609
Unless you consider our time apart...

07:22.693 --> 07:25.320
as a temporary moratorium
on our relationship.

07:25.404 --> 07:29.533
You know, like the time kept passing,
and we were on a sabbatical.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.286
- Yeah, it's complicated.
- Very.

07:33.412 --> 07:37.124
- So a double date? With adults?
- No, just with Mom and Max.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.418
What will it be? Like, dinner and dancing?

07:39.459 --> 07:42.462
Yes, and then we'll enjoy
brandy and cigars.

07:42.546 --> 07:46.675
- No, we'll probably just grab a bite.
- All right, we could do that.

07:47.759 --> 07:51.430
Hey, let's have two anniversaries.
We can celebrate twice a month.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.724
They're well spread apart,
the 6th and the 24th.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.476
- We can't do that.
- Who's gonna stop us?

07:57.603 --> 08:00.189
- Twice a month?
- Dare to be different.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.524
Twice a month it is.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.612
Why won't you let me help?

08:06.695 --> 08:09.323
- Because you're a danger to the process.
- That's not true.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.701
- I've got numerous scars.
- I cut you that one, two times...

08:12.784 --> 08:14.411
and I've helped you tons of times.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.705
You've helped me twice
and both times you cut me.

08:16.788 --> 08:19.500
- I do like watching you cook.
- I like you watching me cook.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.460
- What's that weird smell?
- It's food.

08:21.543 --> 08:22.544
It smells weird?

08:22.628 --> 08:24.963
No, just weird for this house.
It smells great.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.299
- Rory, can you get that?
- What?

08:27.382 --> 08:30.135
Right down there, with the shiny handle.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.140
- Did you know we had that?
- Not a clue.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.265
Come on.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.018
- Hey, it's on fire!
- It's the broiler.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.186
Wow!

08:39.852 --> 08:42.397
What fallout shelter have you guys
been living in?

08:42.481 --> 08:43.690
He has much knowledge.

08:43.774 --> 08:46.818
- We'll form a cult around him.
- Build a statue many stories high.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.613
- Grow our hair long and stop bathing.
- Please don't.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.323
- Are we eating at the table?
- Wherever.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.033
- TV?
- I'll get a tape.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.619
- Can I at least grab some dishes?
- Far away from me.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.954
Alarmist.

08:57.704 --> 09:02.209
- You don't learn very fast, Injun.
- How fast do you learn, Billy Jack?

09:02.292 --> 09:05.003
- Fast enough.
- 'Billy Jack, I'm gonna kill you...

09:05.087 --> 09:08.298
- 'if it's the last thing I do. '
- He so jinxed himself with that one.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.717
He should've said,
'Billy Jack, I'm gonna kill you...

09:10.801 --> 09:12.636
'or buy myself a lovely chenille sweater. '

09:12.719 --> 09:13.804
Either way, he wins.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.681
How many times
have you seen this movie?

09:15.722 --> 09:16.723
I'm out of digits.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.017
You can't see a Billy Jack movie
too many times.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.103
Who's the guy Billy Jack...

09:21.520 --> 09:24.273
All right, you cats. Very slowly now.

09:24.356 --> 09:27.025
- Let's do some jumping jacks.
- Spread out.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.318
One.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.404
- It's the counting part.
- He means it, Daniel.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.781
Here comes my favorite
and my least favorite line...

09:32.865 --> 09:33.866
all rolled into one.

09:33.949 --> 09:36.201
I'm gonna cut your bowels out.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.538
- Three.
- Comeuppance time.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.081
You talk through the whole movie...

09:41.165 --> 09:42.875
and when I say something, you shush me.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.878
You're talking through parts
we talked through last time.

09:45.961 --> 09:49.381
- We haven't seen those parts in a while.
- Now it's clear.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.469
- Max?
- What? The phone?

09:54.553 --> 09:56.346
- Whoever's closest answers.
- House rule.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.890
You're both closer.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.809
I'd have to walk farther,
around the coffee table.

10:00.893 --> 10:02.644
- My foot's asleep.
- Plus you're taller.

10:02.728 --> 10:05.814
- With longer legs.
- Even if we all left for the phone...

10:05.898 --> 10:07.232
- at the same time...
- I got it.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.650
You're in charge.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.987
I'm gonna like having him around.

10:12.738 --> 10:15.115
- Do you want a refill?
- Sure, same thing.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.912
- We wore him out.
- We tend to do that.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.247
Well, we are Electra Woman and Dyna Girl.

10:22.331 --> 10:25.751
- Electra Woman?
- I think it's time to turn in.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.336
- No, I'm awake.
- You don't look it.

10:27.419 --> 10:30.839
- I'm waiting for the guy with the thing...
- Mom, get him to bed.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.174
Okay.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.343
Come on, honey.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.763
- What happened to Billy Jack?
- I'll explain it to you later.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.057
Good night.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.727
This is weird.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.919
- What is it?
- Nothing. What are you doing?

11:09.253 --> 11:12.047
- Taking back Poland.
- Good luck with that.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.591
- Mom.
- I have a boy in my room.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.760
- So?
- So I have a boy in my room.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.762
- It's Max.
- I know.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.474
- You like Max.
- No. Yes, I do, but it's weird.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.310
We've never had a man in the house
like this up there.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.354
- He's your fiancé.
- Very true.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.481
So all you need to do is adjust.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.985
It's like that time you got
the green stripes in your hair.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.863
- I hated those green stripes.
- Well, I'm tired.

11:35.988 --> 11:38.490
I can think of a better example tomorrow.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.034
No. Wake up.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.623
- We've not properly talked about this.
- About what?

11:46.707 --> 11:49.001
About having Max in the house.
The effect on you.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.003
Don't cover up anything.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.589
I don't have anything to cover up.
I like Max.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.842
I know you do. That's good.
But once we are married...

11:56.925 --> 11:59.178
- nothing will ever be the same again.
- I know.

11:59.261 --> 12:03.307
It won't be the'me and you secret club,
no-boys-allowed thing' anymore.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.225
- It'll be different.
- Not just different.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.686
Our lives as we know them will be over.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.063
- Mom, we're not dying.
- No, we're not dying.

12:10.147 --> 12:13.692
But the life we had is gonna morph
into this mutation that we...

12:13.775 --> 12:16.987
- could never possibly have conceived.
- Like the giant ants in Them!?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.364
Yes, and I don't want it
to be like giant ants...

12:19.448 --> 12:20.991
that's why I'm talking about it now.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.286
I am not anticipating being attacked
by giant, man-eating ants...

12:24.369 --> 12:26.455
- because Max is living here.
- Good.

12:27.206 --> 12:28.665
- Good.
- Weirdo.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.172
You can't walk around
in the buff anymore.

12:35.214 --> 12:37.382
I don't remember
ever walking around in the buff.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.593
- I know one time you did.
- Was I three?

12:39.676 --> 12:41.553
Somewhere around there.

12:42.638 --> 12:44.848
- Does he hog the bed?
- No.

12:44.932 --> 12:48.060
- He's a very stay-on-his-side kind of guy.
- Good.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.438
- He's cute. He wears pajama bottoms.
- Stop there.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.358
Not funny ones. I hate funny bottoms.

12:54.399 --> 12:57.236
I'm gonna call you Funny Bottoms
from now on.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.988
- Aren't you happy?
- Yes.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.492
- I'm happy.
- Then it'll be fine.

13:03.575 --> 13:07.913
- You'll get used to it, having Max there.
- I know. You're right. I will.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.873
I will get used to it.

13:14.336 --> 13:17.047
Mom? You're falling asleep.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.131
So?

13:18.382 --> 13:21.260
You need to be a big girl
and go to your own room.

13:22.386 --> 13:23.470
Okay.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.934
- Fine, 10 more minutes.
- Thank you.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.861
- More?
- Abso-tive-o-lutely.

13:38.944 --> 13:41.280
- What's up, Taylor?
- I know of nothing up.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.198
- What's up, Taylor?
- I'm just happy.

13:43.282 --> 13:44.908
That's what makes me nervous.

13:44.992 --> 13:48.036
You're a paranoid man, Luke.
I feel very sad for you.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.413
Over there.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.582
- Can you clear that one off?
- Why?

13:51.665 --> 13:53.917
'Cause it's bigger. We're three today.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.252
- Three?
- Max is with us.

13:55.294 --> 13:58.672
Max? So when did Max become invisible
to the human eye?

13:58.755 --> 14:00.257
He's on a paper hunt.

14:00.591 --> 14:02.467
Max likes his three papers in the morning.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.469
The Hartford Courant,
The New York Times...

14:04.553 --> 14:05.929
and The Wall Street Journal.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.307
- Three papers?
- He likes to be well-informed.

14:08.348 --> 14:12.769
Reading three papers all reporting
the same news is a terrific use of trees.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.980
You be nice, Luke. I mean it.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.066
- Hey, there.
- Max, buddy.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.235
Top of the morning to you.
You look good today.

14:20.319 --> 14:23.030
- Brown is your color, my friend.
- Thanks.

14:24.198 --> 14:26.491
- So?
- I got two out of three.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.827
- Not bad.
- No one has The Wall Street Journal.

14:28.911 --> 14:33.457
- This isn't a very financially-oriented town.
- Yes, it's more oriented to coffee.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.709
I've got blueberry pancakes this morning.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.586
- Bring them.
- Bring them twice.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.088
- And you?
- I'm gonna need a minute.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.510
- Well, then hold off.
- Same here.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.845
- I might run out of the pancakes.
- Go ahead, order.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.056
- I'll just be a minute.
- It's okay, we'll wait.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.183
I'm almost out and I can't make more.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.310
- Set some aside.
- First come, first served.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.229
- We'll take our chances.
- Yes, we'll wait.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.605
Whatever.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.984
- You didn't need to do that.
- We're happy to.

15:08.242 --> 15:11.119
Yeah, that's still eggs
and your basic breakfast stuff there.

15:11.203 --> 15:12.412
- Just order.
- We're fine.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.331
I want you guys to go at your normal pace.

15:14.373 --> 15:16.708
My rhythm might not
necessarily be your rhythm.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.001
- What's this?
- The lunch menu.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.170
- I stop serving breakfast in an hour.
- Luke.

15:20.254 --> 15:22.130
- I'll have poached eggs.
- Blueberry pancakes.

15:22.214 --> 15:23.632
- Did we make it?
- I set them aside.

15:23.715 --> 15:24.967
Love you.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.972
- What the hell are they doing out there?
- What?

15:30.055 --> 15:31.557
Who is that?

15:31.640 --> 15:33.183
What are they doing, Taylor?

15:33.267 --> 15:36.395
- Looks like they're coning off the street.
- Taylor.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.981
If you must know,
they are a county work crew...

15:39.064 --> 15:43.277
here to install Stars Hollow's
first traffic light and metered crosswalk.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.365
- Hold it.
- Keep going.

15:48.407 --> 15:51.368
You have no controlling
legal authority over this matter.

15:51.410 --> 15:52.619
Stuff it, Taylor. Hold it.

15:52.703 --> 15:55.080
Keep going. And I will not stuff it.

15:55.164 --> 15:57.249
What authority did you have
to authorize this?

15:57.332 --> 16:00.502
You're supposed to inform local
business owners of major projects...

16:00.586 --> 16:01.753
per town rules, meaning me.

16:01.837 --> 16:04.298
Not when it's a matter
of dire public safety...

16:04.381 --> 16:07.342
where the city charter
clearly states that I can function...

16:07.426 --> 16:09.344
unilaterally in the town's best interests.

16:09.428 --> 16:12.681
Dire public safety? We haven't
had an accident here in 10 years!

16:12.764 --> 16:15.225
You can't stop progress, Luke!

16:17.895 --> 16:19.688
Traffic light, huh?

16:19.771 --> 16:21.106
It's unbelievable.

16:21.190 --> 16:24.693
Well, it could always be taken out
with your bare hands or your teeth.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.028
Yeah, I guess.

16:26.195 --> 16:28.447
- Hey, did you get my invitation?
- What?

16:28.488 --> 16:31.617
My wedding invitation for my wedding,
because I'm wedding Max.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.703
Yeah, it's in a pile upstairs somewhere.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.998
Good. So are you coming?

16:38.081 --> 16:42.044
You know, I have to make some calls
about this thing before it's too late.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.046
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

16:50.219 --> 16:52.221
- I can barely walk.
- Bad shoes?

16:52.304 --> 16:54.515
- I ate a cow.
- You had a steak.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.976
- Plus the sides.
- Four people, six baked potatoes.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.520
You boys exaggerate.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.396
- Am I exaggerating?
- Nope.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.857
- Ice cream.
- I'm right behind you.

17:04.483 --> 17:06.859
How could they possibly eat more?

17:07.736 --> 17:11.281
- I'm kind of surprised.
- I know. They're bottomless pits.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.282
I mean at you.

17:13.534 --> 17:16.537
You've known them long enough
not to be so confused.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.624
I'm not confused. I'm just...
What do you mean?

17:20.833 --> 17:24.586
Their eating habits are just the start
of what you have to get used to.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.880
There's tons of stuff
you should be aware of.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.382
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:28.507 --> 17:31.468
Like, don't ever use the last
of the Parmesan cheese.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.971
And never get into a heavy discussion
late at night...

17:34.012 --> 17:36.682
'cause that's when
they're at their crankiest.

17:37.349 --> 17:39.268
- And go with their bits.
- Their bits?

17:39.351 --> 17:43.188
Yes, like if you're eating pizza with them,
and Lorelai decides that...

17:43.272 --> 17:46.692
the pepperoni is angry at the mushrooms
because they have an attitude...

17:46.775 --> 17:50.237
and then she holds up a pepperoni
and it asks for your opinion...

17:50.320 --> 17:52.906
don't just laugh. Answer the pepperoni.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.199
Answer the pepperoni.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.785
Don't let them near puppies,
they'll want every one.

17:56.869 --> 17:58.495
That one I knew.

18:00.289 --> 18:01.540
And here's a big one.

18:01.582 --> 18:05.627
If you ever think that they're doing
something crazy, they're not.

18:05.711 --> 18:09.173
After a while, their thinking becomes
clear, but by the time it's clear...

18:09.256 --> 18:12.801
they've done two other crazy things
that you can't figure out.

18:12.885 --> 18:14.303
So there's no catching up.

18:14.386 --> 18:17.556
- You have much knowledge.
- You got that from Rory.

18:17.598 --> 18:21.101
And does Lorelai know
what kind of ice cream you like?

18:21.185 --> 18:24.897
- Yeah, chocolate chip. I already told her...
- Chocolate chip.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.065
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

18:27.900 --> 18:28.859
Wow.

18:31.737 --> 18:34.615
I'm so full.
Why did you let me eat so much?

18:35.616 --> 18:37.576
Yeah. They'll blame you.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.001
- It's past 11:00, guys.
- Okay.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.932
- How're you doing?
- I'm stable.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.475
You're a lovely shade of puce.

19:01.558 --> 19:05.187
Don't say puce. It sounds like
another word I don't want to hear now.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.396
Sorry.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.066
You know, they're still outside.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.902
- Who?
- Rory and Dean.

19:13.070 --> 19:14.947
How long you think they'll be out there?

19:14.988 --> 19:17.574
- I don't know.
- So there's no time limit?

19:17.616 --> 19:20.786
Yes. When they both get tired of saying,
'No, you're prettier'...

19:20.869 --> 19:22.538
to each other, the night's over.

19:22.621 --> 19:23.997
- Come on.
- What?

19:24.081 --> 19:27.584
- I'm going to be living here soon.
- I know that.

19:27.626 --> 19:30.295
I just thought I should know
what the procedure is...

19:30.379 --> 19:33.549
- when stuff like this comes up.
- Stuff like what?

19:33.715 --> 19:38.220
Say you're not here, I come home,
there's Rory and Dean in the dark...

19:38.303 --> 19:41.723
all alone, after 11:00.
How do I handle stuff like that?

19:41.807 --> 19:44.434
Max, Rory is very low maintenance.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.979
Kind of like that robot kid in Al.

19:47.062 --> 19:50.023
Only way less mother-obsessed.
My God, that kid was so annoying.

19:50.107 --> 19:53.068
I would have pushed him out of the car
while it was moving.

19:53.151 --> 19:57.155
What if I catch them one night
making out on the couch?

19:58.866 --> 20:01.910
- Turn off the light?
- You're not being serious.

20:01.994 --> 20:04.454
Max, they're teenagers.
They can kiss a little bit.

20:04.496 --> 20:08.125
Okay, what do I do
if Rory comes home drunk?

20:08.167 --> 20:10.544
- Come on!
- It happens.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.087
Not to Rory, it doesn't.

20:12.171 --> 20:15.841
I know, but theoretically,
just in a make-believe world...

20:15.883 --> 20:17.718
if she did, what would I do?

20:18.385 --> 20:21.346
- Nothing.
- Excuse me?

20:21.430 --> 20:24.183
You would do nothing. I would handle it.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.186
So basically, I have no role in Rory's life.

20:27.269 --> 20:30.105
Max, Rory's done. She's brought up.

20:30.189 --> 20:32.608
She's Rory. You don't need a role.

20:33.358 --> 20:34.484
Fine.

20:35.777 --> 20:37.529
I don't see the problem here.

20:37.613 --> 20:41.700
Clearly. So I should do nothing
around here, ever.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.119
- No, not nothing ever.
- What, then?

20:44.203 --> 20:47.039
Making the garlic bread the other night
was really good.

20:47.122 --> 20:49.958
So other than making garlic bread
and answering the phone...

20:50.042 --> 20:52.127
what else is my role around here?

20:52.503 --> 20:57.257
You're my fellow.
You're my guy, my old man.

20:57.341 --> 21:00.010
- And what does that entail?
- All things dirty.

21:00.052 --> 21:03.847
- I'm not joking. We're getting married.
- I know.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.559
That means we'll take two separate lives
and meld them together.

21:07.601 --> 21:10.354
- How do you think that's gonna work?
- I don't know.

21:10.395 --> 21:14.024
- Have you given it any thought at all?
- Not really.

21:14.691 --> 21:18.654
But I will. I'll start now.

21:18.904 --> 21:23.075
How would you feel if I told you,
'I haven't thought about our future at alI'?

21:23.158 --> 21:26.078
Terrible. I would feel terrible. I'm sorry.

21:27.204 --> 21:29.915
I mean it. I'm sorry. Please come here.

21:32.334 --> 21:35.587
Remember, it's all those
little annoying quirks...

21:36.088 --> 21:39.675
that make me the fascinating woman
you fell in love with.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.099
Really not fair.

21:47.266 --> 21:50.143
I've got a lingerie drawer
full of not fair, mister.

21:50.227 --> 21:53.230
Okay. We didn't need
to get into this tonight.

21:53.772 --> 21:57.025
I definitely broke Dean's
late-night cranky rule.

21:58.861 --> 22:01.905
- Whose what?
- Nothing.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.581
Welcome, townspeople.

22:11.874 --> 22:14.710
So you're going to spoil it
right off the bat, Luke?

22:14.793 --> 22:16.295
- Why waste time?
- What about dinner?

22:16.378 --> 22:19.298
- You don't eat at a bachelorette party.
- You got to eat.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.884
You drink, dance, party,
and drink some more.

22:21.967 --> 22:23.969
I'll hurl before the night's half over.

22:24.052 --> 22:27.598
- This is all very fascinating.
- Sorry, we'll keep it down.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.474
- How about keeping it silent?
- Way down.

22:29.516 --> 22:32.603
- Or zipping it shut?
- Little, tiny mice voices.

22:32.895 --> 22:36.648
Townspeople, we should all be proud
of the new addition to our streets.

22:36.690 --> 22:40.652
I know many of you have wanted
a traffic light and a crosswalk for years...

22:40.694 --> 22:41.695
What?

22:41.778 --> 22:44.031
...and now your dream has come true.

22:44.114 --> 22:46.033
- It's like Hitler's Germany.
- Luke!

22:46.116 --> 22:49.745
You're trying to brainwash us, telling us
we want something that we don't...

22:49.828 --> 22:51.163
and not giving us any choice.

22:51.246 --> 22:54.708
- Shush, we're planning.
- I heard. You're idiots if you don't eat first.

22:54.791 --> 22:59.171
Everybody, let me segue into
the informational portion of our gathering.

22:59.254 --> 23:02.216
If I can turn your attention
to the pole here...

23:02.299 --> 23:06.512
you will see a yellow button
with an instructional panel right above it.

23:06.595 --> 23:09.640
My God, that's the biggest yellow button
I've ever seen.

23:09.681 --> 23:13.727
If you'll read the panel above the button,
you'll learn how the system works.

23:13.810 --> 23:16.522
'To cross street, push yellow button,
wait for walk signal.

23:16.563 --> 23:20.150
'When signal reads 'walk', step into
street and proceed to the other side. '

23:20.234 --> 23:23.946
- It's written for morons.
- In big, stupid letters, too.

23:24.196 --> 23:25.781
I hate being infantilized.

23:25.864 --> 23:29.201
Does no one here care
about the spate of near-accidents...

23:29.284 --> 23:31.328
we have suffered over the past year?

23:31.411 --> 23:33.455
Near-accidents,
meaning they didn't happen.

23:33.539 --> 23:36.667
Because they didn't, doesn't mean
we shouldn't ward against them.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.545
Lots of things don't happen
that we don't ward against.

23:39.628 --> 23:41.797
- Like?
- Like everything.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.883
So everything doesn't happen here,
meaning nothing happens?

23:44.967 --> 23:47.344
It's not nothing happens. Stuff happens.

23:47.386 --> 23:50.013
It's that it's not everything that's...

23:52.266 --> 23:53.725
Damn it, Taylor!

23:55.227 --> 23:58.188
Now for some interesting stats.

23:58.313 --> 24:02.901
It's you, me, Miss Patty, Rory, Babbette.
Babbette, you're coming, right?

24:02.985 --> 24:06.530
- Doll, I'm sorry, I won't be able to make it.
- Babbette, no.

24:06.572 --> 24:08.657
We're having Morey's parents
over for dinner.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.409
If you cancel on them last minute...

24:10.492 --> 24:13.162
they'll stick a red hot poker
up your you-know-where.

24:13.245 --> 24:14.705
We'll miss you.

24:14.746 --> 24:17.749
But stick your hand down the front
of some guy's pants for me.

24:17.791 --> 24:20.878
- I hope you're talking about a stripper.
- Whatever.

24:20.961 --> 24:25.382
The length of the walk-signaI's duration
has thoughtfully been timed...

24:25.424 --> 24:29.720
to accommodate the pace
of Stars Hollow's oldest living resident.

24:30.179 --> 24:35.184
So to inaugurate the signal,
our beloved Mrs. Lanahan...

24:35.434 --> 24:40.272
is going to push the button and lead
the first historic group across the street.

24:41.398 --> 24:44.026
- Ready with the camera, Kirk?
- Rolling.

24:45.694 --> 24:48.614
The cap is still on the lens, dear.

24:49.615 --> 24:50.824
Thanks.

24:52.284 --> 24:54.077
I'm not wearing a veil at the party.

24:54.119 --> 24:56.663
The bride always wears a veil
at the bachelorette party.

24:56.747 --> 24:59.917
- I'm not wearing a veil at the wedding.
- You're not? I love veils.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.961
- No, we're going cas.
- It's a big day. You gotta have some pomp.

25:03.045 --> 25:05.214
- Elope and get it over with.
- No one asked you.

25:05.297 --> 25:07.090
Eloping was not out of the question.

25:07.132 --> 25:09.009
But you don't get a wedding over with.

25:09.092 --> 25:12.095
Why not? It's a bureaucratic
civil ceremony, and a pointless one.

25:12.179 --> 25:14.598
- Don't listen to him.
- He's just being Luke.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.559
It's not biologically natural
for people to mate for life.

25:17.643 --> 25:19.311
Animals don't mate for life.

25:19.394 --> 25:22.064
Well, ducks do, but who the hell cares
what ducks do?

25:22.147 --> 25:24.274
People grow and evolve their whole lives.

25:24.316 --> 25:28.028
The chances that you'll grow and evolve
at the same rate as someone else...

25:28.111 --> 25:30.864
are too slim to take.
The minute you say 'I do'...

25:30.948 --> 25:34.618
you're sticking yourself in a tiny little box
for the rest of your life...

25:34.660 --> 25:36.411
but at least you had a party first.

25:36.495 --> 25:38.580
Okay, I'm tired of you now.

25:38.664 --> 25:42.459
We're gonna finish this conversation
away from Crotchety Guy.

25:55.013 --> 25:57.558
This place looks like fun.

25:57.683 --> 26:00.060
- They'll never let me in.
- They will let you in.

26:00.143 --> 26:02.938
This is a felony, you know,
corrupting a minor.

26:03.021 --> 26:04.731
We'll all end up in the pokey.

26:04.815 --> 26:06.733
He's right. We're all going to the pokey.

26:06.817 --> 26:08.569
Don't say pokey. It's creepy.

26:08.652 --> 26:10.195
- Try to look older.
- How?

26:10.279 --> 26:12.990
Look like you're thinking about
retirement, 401s.

26:13.031 --> 26:15.534
You should've brought
your fake beard and mustache.

26:15.576 --> 26:16.785
Who invited Mr. Snicklefritz?

26:16.869 --> 26:18.662
He heard us planning and wanted to come.

26:18.704 --> 26:21.206
I did not know the evening
included baby-sitting.

26:21.248 --> 26:23.167
She's going to get in.

26:25.169 --> 26:26.336
Sorry.

26:30.007 --> 26:33.010
So my bachelor party's
come to a screeching halt.

26:33.051 --> 26:34.052
What? Why?

26:34.136 --> 26:37.055
There's been an accident.
I'm fine, but we're at the hospital.

26:37.139 --> 26:38.515
My God, what happened?

26:38.557 --> 26:41.560
We were coming out of the restaurant,
going to our next stop...

26:41.602 --> 26:44.313
when my brother decides to
leapfrog over a parking meter.

26:44.396 --> 26:46.523
- Why did he do that?
- Middle child.

26:46.607 --> 26:49.484
- Poor Jan.
- Anyway, he didn't make it.

26:49.568 --> 26:51.486
Ouch. How drunk was he?

26:51.570 --> 26:54.656
He's saying that the parking meters
in Hartford are taller...

26:54.740 --> 26:57.784
than the parking meters in Duluth,
so he miscalculated.

26:58.619 --> 27:01.205
I've got a concussion. I'm good.
Let's drink!

27:01.246 --> 27:05.083
- Hold on a second. You got a concussion?
- A little one, though.

27:05.125 --> 27:07.419
- What is he saying?
- It's a mild concussion.

27:07.461 --> 27:10.923
- We're taking him home.
- Take him home, then go hit a strip club.

27:11.006 --> 27:14.593
- Excuse me?
- I am telling you, this is your last chance...

27:14.676 --> 27:16.428
to look at another woman's breastage.

27:16.470 --> 27:18.931
Point well taken. I'll call you tomorrow.

27:19.056 --> 27:23.018
Okay, new rule for the evening:
No calls to fiancés or boyfriends...

27:23.101 --> 27:26.980
or anything else like that.
It's girls' night out! Plus Michel.

27:29.024 --> 27:31.944
It's $12. And it's 18 and over.

27:32.945 --> 27:34.029
She's 18.

27:34.112 --> 27:38.700
That's right, last week.
So it's a new 18, but it's 18.

27:38.826 --> 27:39.910
You got some ID?

27:39.993 --> 27:44.164
Hey, sir, make way for Rory.
That's her name and her only name.

27:44.248 --> 27:45.958
Rory. Single name, she's that important.

27:46.041 --> 27:48.752
Internationally known
international supermodel...

27:48.794 --> 27:51.672
and sometimes spokesperson
for international products.

27:51.755 --> 27:52.965
She's very big in Germany.

27:53.006 --> 27:55.592
Ja, with the Lederhosen and such.

27:56.635 --> 27:58.512
- $12.
- Thank you.

27:59.513 --> 28:01.056
Danke schon, cutie.

28:14.069 --> 28:16.446
This is a drag club.

28:16.488 --> 28:20.784
It's called the Queen Victoria.
What did you expect? Tea and crumpets?

28:20.868 --> 28:23.620
Guys, I guess we're going to
have to stand.

28:23.704 --> 28:25.747
Wait, that one looks open.

28:31.128 --> 28:32.337
Oh, my God.

28:33.005 --> 28:36.133
What in Lucifer's reach
is my mother doing here?

28:36.175 --> 28:38.510
- I invited her.
- You what?

28:38.552 --> 28:42.347
Just a little surprise for you.
I thought it would be a kick.

28:45.684 --> 28:48.437
Excuse me, sir,
you look just like my mother.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.063
Hi, Grandma. Come here often?

28:50.147 --> 28:52.024
I should say not. How did you get in?

28:52.107 --> 28:54.860
Apparently, I'm an internationally
known supermodel.

28:54.943 --> 28:58.155
- Happy bachelorette party, Lorelai.
- Thank you, Mother.

28:58.197 --> 29:02.201
In the future, when you plan something
and tell a person to show up at 8:00...

29:02.284 --> 29:05.537
it is considered good manners
for you to also show up at 8:00.

29:05.621 --> 29:08.415
I didn't actually invite you, Mother.
Michel did.

29:08.499 --> 29:11.043
- I feel much better now.
- Let's drink.

29:11.126 --> 29:14.171
Looks like Emily's gotten a head start.
What are you drinking?

29:14.254 --> 29:16.840
Manhattan. Good, too. Not too sweet.

29:17.174 --> 29:19.968
I ordered it from that nice chap
dressed as Joan Crawford.

29:20.052 --> 29:24.681
So is there no dancing here?
I was hoping there'd be dancing.

29:24.765 --> 29:26.642
You need to strut, Tony Manero?

29:26.725 --> 29:29.144
It is a weekend, and on the weekends,
I like to move.

29:29.228 --> 29:31.063
And the ladies, they like it, too.

29:31.146 --> 29:33.398
Especially when you move out of town.

29:34.233 --> 29:36.568
- Has she eaten?
- Yeah, about a quart of wine.

29:36.610 --> 29:39.071
- Hi, Mae West.
- What can I get for you?

29:39.154 --> 29:40.697
My dignity back.

29:40.781 --> 29:44.910
A rum and coke, margarita, no salt,
martini with olives, a Shirley Temple.

29:44.993 --> 29:47.412
- Love her.
- I'll have her on the rocks, please.

29:47.454 --> 29:51.416
And I'll have a giant Long Island Iced Tea.

29:51.458 --> 29:52.751
Coming up.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.295
Lorelai, how're you feeling?

29:55.379 --> 29:58.590
I'm tipsy, but just short of seeing
pink elephants.

29:58.674 --> 30:01.218
I mean about you getting married.
It's only a week away.

30:01.260 --> 30:06.181
I'm fine. I figured once I got the shoes to
match the dress, the rest was just gravy.

30:06.431 --> 30:08.392
I must say, I admire your composure.

30:08.433 --> 30:10.310
The week before my wedding,
I was a wreck.

30:10.394 --> 30:13.772
- So was I, before all of mine.
- How many was that?

30:13.856 --> 30:18.026
There was Sinjen, John, Sergio, Sinjen.
Three men, four times.

30:18.110 --> 30:19.403
You regret any of them?

30:19.444 --> 30:22.865
Sinjen was a letdown the second time...

30:22.948 --> 30:25.576
but he was my Burton,
and I was his Taylor.

30:25.617 --> 30:28.537
I just wish I could've found
a little Mike Todd in the middle.

30:28.620 --> 30:31.832
I can't believe it was 34 years ago
that I married Richard.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.584
I remember it so distinctly.

30:33.625 --> 30:37.296
- There's going to be a romantic story.
- My stomach was not my friend.

30:37.379 --> 30:40.799
- It was full of butterflies, I couldn't eat.
- What a bummer.

30:40.841 --> 30:43.844
I was actually weak in the knees,
trembling all the time.

30:43.927 --> 30:44.928
Really?

30:44.970 --> 30:48.599
When I wasn't actually with Richard,
I was thinking about him constantly.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.643
Imagining what he was doing,
was he thinking about me...

30:51.685 --> 30:53.854
making up little scenarios in my head...

30:53.937 --> 30:56.940
about how we'd run into each other
accidentally at the club...

30:56.982 --> 30:59.484
and he would be playing golf,
and I would walk by...

30:59.568 --> 31:03.864
and he would be so distracted
that he'd completely miss the ball. Silly.

31:03.947 --> 31:05.574
- It's sweet.
- I was in love.

31:05.657 --> 31:07.868
It is wonderful to be in love.

31:08.035 --> 31:12.706
But the thing I remember most was that
for the entire week before my wedding...

31:12.831 --> 31:16.293
I'd wait till my mother went to sleep,
and I'd sneak out of bed...

31:16.335 --> 31:20.172
and I'd put on my wedding dress
and my tiara and my gloves...

31:20.380 --> 31:23.842
and I would stare at myself
in the mirror and think...

31:24.009 --> 31:25.886
how very safe I felt...

31:26.011 --> 31:29.389
how very right and wise and honored.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.977
This is a very good drink.
I highly recommend it.

31:34.019 --> 31:36.021
Okay, I've got to make a call.

31:36.063 --> 31:38.273
- Are you calling Jackson?
- No.

31:38.565 --> 31:41.944
Well, yes, but it's only because
I need to pick up...

31:42.027 --> 31:45.364
something I left at his house that,
if it's still there, I should...

31:45.447 --> 31:47.407
Hi, honey, it's me.

31:47.491 --> 31:49.576
And who are you writing to?

31:49.701 --> 31:53.622
- I just want to see if Dean's around.
- And thinking about you?

31:57.084 --> 32:01.213
- No, not you, too.
- No, it's... I'll be quick.

32:06.468 --> 32:08.512
- Hi.
- Hi, who's this?

32:08.637 --> 32:12.057
It's Trixie from the other night.
You never called me.

32:12.099 --> 32:15.727
- Lorelai?
- You got me. What're you doing?

32:15.811 --> 32:17.771
I'm just hanging out. What're you doing?

32:17.855 --> 32:20.440
I'm at a bachelorette party.

32:20.691 --> 32:22.985
- Cool. Whose?
- Mine.

32:23.235 --> 32:25.487
Yours? Wow.

32:25.696 --> 32:28.073
I know, I'm still kind of wow
about it myself.

32:28.115 --> 32:29.366
Who's the lucky guy?

32:29.408 --> 32:31.285
You don't know him. His name's Max.

32:31.368 --> 32:33.745
- Right. Max.
- You do know him?

32:33.829 --> 32:36.790
Rory mentioned him.
She didn't mention it was serious.

32:36.874 --> 32:40.210
It wasn't. We hooked up,
and then it was going good...

32:40.252 --> 32:42.838
and then we broke up
'cause one of us freaked out.

32:42.921 --> 32:44.756
- You freaked out.
- I freaked out...

32:44.798 --> 32:48.260
and then we got back together
and it suddenly got very serious.

32:48.343 --> 32:49.344
So is he worthy?

32:49.428 --> 32:52.389
- Is anyone?
- Bono, maybe? Bryan Ferry?

32:52.472 --> 32:54.474
- Get serious.
- A young Tom Waits?

32:54.558 --> 32:55.809
Now you're talking.

32:55.893 --> 32:58.061
- What's he like?
- He's great.

32:58.103 --> 32:59.980
Could you be a little more vague?

33:00.063 --> 33:02.274
I don't know, he's Max. He's great.

33:02.357 --> 33:04.276
What's his CD collection like?

33:04.318 --> 33:06.612
Don't read into his CD collection.

33:06.695 --> 33:08.238
Jazz? Classical? What's the story?

33:08.322 --> 33:10.449
It's kind of a general collection.

33:12.326 --> 33:15.704
Are we talking a dozen soundtracks,
a few Beatles, a Bob Dylan...

33:15.787 --> 33:17.331
- plus a generic...
- I said don't.

33:17.414 --> 33:18.415
Alanis Morissette?

33:18.499 --> 33:21.877
A lot of people knee-jerked
about her first one. Cut them some slack.

33:21.960 --> 33:24.421
- Dave Matthews?
- A couple of his things are good.

33:24.505 --> 33:26.757
- Buena Vista Social Club?
- Stop it.

33:26.798 --> 33:28.550
- Enya?
- I'm going to hit you.

33:28.634 --> 33:29.635
We're on the phone.

33:29.718 --> 33:32.971
- I'll come over and hit you.
- You're at your bachelorette party.

33:33.013 --> 33:36.141
- Right.
- So why are you calling me?

33:37.226 --> 33:39.603
Because you know me really well.

33:40.145 --> 33:41.230
Yes, I do.

33:41.313 --> 33:45.108
And I just wanted to tell someone
who knows me really well...

33:45.150 --> 33:46.818
that I'm getting married.

33:46.902 --> 33:50.656
As someone who knows you really well,
I say congratulations.

33:50.781 --> 33:53.033
If you found the guy, I think that's great.

33:53.116 --> 33:55.577
And you can picture me married, right?

33:55.661 --> 33:58.622
Yeah. To the right guy,
I can picture you married.

33:58.705 --> 33:59.790
Thanks.

33:59.873 --> 34:03.085
- You should get back to your party.
- Right.

34:04.169 --> 34:07.214
- He's a great guy, Max.
- I'm sure he is.

34:07.422 --> 34:09.591
- I was just kidding around.
- I know.

34:09.842 --> 34:12.094
- I'll talk to you later.
- Bye.

34:12.177 --> 34:15.264
- Can you put Trixie back on the phone?
- Bye.

34:22.020 --> 34:25.440
- Michel leave?
- No. He said he had to shake his thing.

34:37.452 --> 34:39.121
So how's your guy?

34:39.705 --> 34:42.123
- How's Max doing?
- Fine.

34:42.708 --> 34:44.585
Everything's just fine.

34:52.842 --> 34:56.013
I think I know what an aneurysm feels like
before you have it.

34:56.054 --> 34:58.849
Like a baseball
the size of a cantaloupe in your head.

34:58.891 --> 35:00.517
- Good one.
- What?

35:00.726 --> 35:03.687
- Baseball the size of a cantaloupe.
- Yeah.

35:04.021 --> 35:08.525
Because a baseball can only be one size,
so it's a Yogi Berra type thing.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.402
Yogi Bear?

35:11.153 --> 35:13.489
No. Forget it.

35:13.572 --> 35:16.116
I feel like crap on toast.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.410
Where were you
after you broke off from the group?

35:18.494 --> 35:23.332
I sat at a table with Janet Jackson
and Celine Dion. Very nice guys.

35:23.582 --> 35:27.711
By the way, your husband-to-be
is out there looking annoyingly perky.

35:27.794 --> 35:29.713
Slap him or I will.

35:36.887 --> 35:37.888
What did I do?

35:37.930 --> 35:40.557
- You spoke at a normal volume.
- Sorry.

35:41.058 --> 35:43.560
I'm just mad you're not more hung over.

35:43.644 --> 35:45.687
- I tried. I did.
- Liar.

35:45.771 --> 35:47.231
I drank copiously.

35:47.272 --> 35:50.734
People who've drunk copiously
do not use words like 'copiously'.

35:50.776 --> 35:52.319
Ask my brother.

35:52.444 --> 35:53.946
How is Mr. McMeterhopper?

35:53.987 --> 35:56.198
Ironically, he feels better than you.

35:56.281 --> 35:58.659
- It's so wrong.
- He's fine.

35:59.201 --> 36:02.746
I was going to drop my printer off
at the house, but Rory wasn't there...

36:02.830 --> 36:05.165
and guess who doesn't have
his own set of keys yet?

36:05.249 --> 36:07.543
- I'm guessing it's you.
- It's still me.

36:07.793 --> 36:09.294
Max, I'm sorry. I forgot.

36:09.336 --> 36:10.838
- Again.
- Again.

36:11.547 --> 36:14.091
- You're mad.
- No. A little.

36:14.174 --> 36:16.844
- They're just keys.
- Try being without them and say that.

36:16.927 --> 36:19.721
- I've lost my keys before.
- I haven't. I never got them.

36:19.805 --> 36:20.764
You'll get them.

36:20.848 --> 36:23.642
I'm trying really hard not to read
too much into this.

36:23.684 --> 36:25.310
- Like what?
- Like you don't want me...

36:25.394 --> 36:27.521
having keys or coming in the house.

36:27.604 --> 36:30.941
- Max, that's crazy.
- Well, I need keys.

36:30.983 --> 36:32.734
I need an assistant.

36:32.818 --> 36:37.406
You need to think about someone other
than yourself for a few minutes a day.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.366
Ouch.

36:41.243 --> 36:44.496
That was too strong.
Maybe I am a little hung over.

36:46.582 --> 36:49.751
This is not a good day
for keys or communication.

36:50.002 --> 36:52.880
- I'll just bring the printer by later.
- Bring it tomorrow.

36:52.963 --> 36:56.216
- I'll bring it tomorrow.
- Okay. I'll have the keys.

37:05.309 --> 37:07.394
I can't believe schooI's already starting.

37:07.477 --> 37:10.814
I used to hate school starting.
I once flipped the pages back...

37:10.856 --> 37:13.483
on my mom's calendar
and tried to convince her...

37:13.525 --> 37:15.110
it was June and not September.

37:15.194 --> 37:17.279
- Didn't work?
- Oddly enough.

37:17.488 --> 37:20.199
- I got an interesting call today.
- Yeah? Who?

37:20.324 --> 37:22.493
- Dad.
- Cool. How is he?

37:22.534 --> 37:25.037
- I talked to him last night.
- He mentioned that.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.081
- I was about to mention it myself.
- That's quite a coincidence.

37:28.165 --> 37:31.251
- Did I not mention it last night?
- No, not to my knowledge.

37:31.335 --> 37:33.337
I could have sworn I did.

37:33.545 --> 37:37.132
- Why did you call him?
- Just to check in.

37:37.216 --> 37:40.302
- At your bachelorette party?
- Seemed as good a time as any.

37:40.385 --> 37:43.347
- To catch up on calls?
- Yeah, pretty much.

37:43.388 --> 37:45.390
Seems like a weird time.

37:46.391 --> 37:50.145
- Did he call just to fink on me?
- No, he wanted to see what's up with you.

37:50.229 --> 37:51.897
He thought it was weird, too.

37:51.980 --> 37:54.483
Heaven forbid I ever use the phone again.

37:54.566 --> 37:56.568
Was it when you told us
you were calling Max?

37:56.652 --> 37:58.153
Somewhere around there.

37:58.237 --> 37:59.822
Why did you say you were calling Max?

37:59.905 --> 38:02.574
Honey, some day
when you're a little older...

38:02.658 --> 38:06.578
you will be introduced to something
that is extremely seductive but fickle.

38:06.620 --> 38:11.208
A fair-weather friend who seems benign
but packs a wallop like a donkey kick.

38:11.291 --> 38:14.002
That is the Long Island Iced Tea.

38:14.253 --> 38:18.298
The Long Island Iced Tea makes you do
things that you normally wouldn't do.

38:18.382 --> 38:20.384
Like lifting your skirt in public...

38:20.467 --> 38:23.720
or calling someone you normally
wouldn't call at really weird times.

38:23.762 --> 38:25.764
I'm not looking forward to meeting it.

38:25.806 --> 38:28.141
I'd definitely walk the other way.

38:28.225 --> 38:31.228
- You know, Dad wants you to be happy.
- I know.

38:31.311 --> 38:34.439
- And I really want you to be happy.
- I know, sweetie.

38:34.523 --> 38:36.984
You are happy about all this, aren't you?

38:37.109 --> 38:39.736
- Don't I seem happy?
- I guess.

38:39.820 --> 38:41.196
Okay, then.

38:41.864 --> 38:44.825
- I'll be in my room if you need me.
- Okay.

39:03.093 --> 39:05.470
- What is that?
- It's a huppah.

39:06.054 --> 39:07.264
- A what?
- A huppah.

39:07.306 --> 39:10.434
You stand under it, you and Max.
It's for your wedding.

39:11.143 --> 39:12.144
Did you make that?

39:12.227 --> 39:15.147
Yeah, I had some time, so...
Give me a hand.

39:16.481 --> 39:20.027
- Luke, it's beautiful.
- Well, I saw a picture in a book.

39:20.486 --> 39:22.112
The picture looks better.

39:22.154 --> 39:25.407
It's got carvings. Birds and flowers.

39:25.491 --> 39:28.452
- Yeah, there's also a goat.
- A goat?

39:28.494 --> 39:31.663
I don't know what it stands for,
but it was in the picture...

39:31.747 --> 39:32.789
and you like goats, right?

39:32.873 --> 39:35.876
- Yeah, goats are good.
- Okay, so there you go.

39:36.418 --> 39:38.545
What on earth inspired you to do this?

39:38.629 --> 39:41.465
You're getting married.
You can't just stand in the hot sun...

39:41.507 --> 39:44.051
in the middle of a lawn
that hasn't been mowed in weeks.

39:44.134 --> 39:46.428
- I guess he doesn't mow?
- No, Max isn't a mower.

39:46.512 --> 39:50.557
Okay, you needed something. Here it is.
I'll mow it if you want.

39:50.641 --> 39:53.101
We got one of the Petes
from the nursery to do that.

39:53.185 --> 39:54.520
- Big Pete?
- Little Pete.

39:54.561 --> 39:58.106
- He's the better of the Petes.
- We've always thought so.

39:58.690 --> 40:01.318
Aren't huppahs Jewish?

40:03.028 --> 40:04.238
Maybe.

40:05.197 --> 40:08.033
Is it okay that Max and I aren't Jewish?

40:08.450 --> 40:09.535
It's okay by me.

40:09.618 --> 40:12.955
I mean to stand under it.
God won't smite us or anything?

40:13.038 --> 40:14.164
I highly doubt it.

40:14.206 --> 40:18.001
Plus God would probably have to get
a license from Taylor to do any smiting...

40:18.043 --> 40:21.421
in Stars Hollow on a weekend,
so I'd say you're safe.

40:23.131 --> 40:27.511
You know, I wasn't putting down Max.
He seems like a really good guy.

40:27.594 --> 40:31.056
- He is, and you were putting him down.
- Well, I didn't mean to.

40:32.266 --> 40:34.935
Did you mean all those things you said
about marriage?

40:35.018 --> 40:36.019
What things?

40:36.061 --> 40:38.689
- Really want me to repeat them to you?
- No.

40:38.730 --> 40:41.066
I guess for some people...

40:41.108 --> 40:44.695
marriage, you know,
isn't the worst thing in the world.

40:44.778 --> 40:49.116
I mean, it's probably better than
being hobbled or something like that.

40:50.742 --> 40:53.787
And people can evolve together,
don't you think?

40:53.871 --> 40:56.248
- Maybe.
- Yoko and John Lennon did.

40:56.290 --> 40:58.500
They just got closer and closer with time.

40:58.584 --> 41:01.420
- At the end, they had the same face.
- It got a little spooky.

41:01.461 --> 41:03.422
- But cool.
- Yeah, they were lucky.

41:03.505 --> 41:08.427
I guess if you can find that one person
who's willing to put up with all your crap...

41:08.594 --> 41:11.597
and doesn't want to change you
or dress you...

41:12.181 --> 41:15.934
or make you eat French food,
then marriage can be all right.

41:16.935 --> 41:20.022
But that's only if you find that person.

41:20.397 --> 41:23.192
Yeah, if you find that person.

41:31.158 --> 41:33.744
No one has ever
made me a huppah before.

41:34.161 --> 41:37.456
Well, you only
get married once. Theoretically.

41:38.957 --> 41:41.293
Yeah, you only get married once.

41:53.180 --> 41:54.223
Pack.

41:54.306 --> 41:55.724
- What?
- Pack.

41:55.933 --> 41:58.435
- What's going on?
- We are hitting the road.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.562
- What?
- Pack everything.

42:00.646 --> 42:02.606
What's going on?
Why are we hitting the road?

42:02.648 --> 42:06.109
We haven't taken a road trip in forever,
and the weather is perfect.

42:06.193 --> 42:09.363
We can't take a road trip.
You're getting married this weekend.

42:09.446 --> 42:11.615
- Do you have my blue swimsuit?
- What about Max?

42:11.698 --> 42:14.117
- We need sunscreen.
- Mom, stop.

42:14.535 --> 42:17.287
- What?
- Are you and Max getting married?

42:18.997 --> 42:20.916
- No.
- Why?

42:26.672 --> 42:30.467
Because I didn't want to try on
my wedding dress every night.

42:35.264 --> 42:37.015
Where are we going?

42:37.766 --> 42:40.769
- We don't have to.
- Hot, cold, rocky, sandy, mountain, valley?

42:40.853 --> 42:44.982
- I didn't really have a particular spot.
- Packing for all contingencies. Got it.

42:45.065 --> 42:48.402
- Light layers.
- Yeah, light layers.

42:48.485 --> 42:49.945
Do you need a book?

42:50.821 --> 42:53.198
- That Colette biography.
- I lost your place in it.

42:53.282 --> 42:55.659
- It's okay, I have to start over anyway.
- You got it.

42:55.701 --> 42:57.911
- And hurry.
- Are we going tonight?

42:57.995 --> 42:59.663
- First thing in the morning.
- Sevenish?

42:59.705 --> 43:01.999
Fiveish. It'll be more like sixish.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.167
Let's shoot for fiveish.

43:03.208 --> 43:05.419
You are crazy, and I love it.

43:11.258 --> 43:14.469
- Wow, totally deserted.
- We're the last ones left.

43:15.137 --> 43:18.599
- So are we almost there?
- We're almost there and nowhere near it.

43:18.682 --> 43:20.434
All that matters is we're going.

43:20.517 --> 43:23.729
- We're practically gone already.
- Look out, world.
