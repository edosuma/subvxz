That he'd rather die back home
than live here.

38:41.094 --> 38:42.927
[ Chuckles ]

38:42.962 --> 38:44.162
What?

38:44.197 --> 38:47.832
It's just
such a stupid thing to say.

38:50.103 --> 38:52.837
My whole family
died back home.

38:56.976 --> 39:01.012
I was out with my grandma
when they bombed our village--

39:01.047 --> 39:03.848
my parents,
brother and sisters,

39:03.883 --> 39:06.184
aunt and uncle, cousins.

39:06.219 --> 39:09.120
These kids have no idea--

39:09.155 --> 39:14.058
family, more food than
they can eat, all these clothes.

39:14.094 --> 39:16.928
I can get Pasha
to do anything I want.

39:16.963 --> 39:19.230
He's weak.

39:19.265 --> 39:22.967
You've done a good job
with him.

39:23.002 --> 39:26.137
Yesterday, I went to his house.
The car wasn't there.

39:26.172 --> 39:28.940
- It was back today.
- Same spot?

39:28.975 --> 39:30.141
Yeah.

39:30.176 --> 39:31.976
I don't know
if there's a pattern.

39:32.011 --> 39:33.311
I'm working on a schedule.

39:33.346 --> 39:37.115
If they're skipping days,
they think the threat's low.

39:37.150 --> 39:39.117
Maybe they watch him
for the first couple of months

39:39.152 --> 39:40.885
after they move in.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.987
I still don't like
showing up on their reports

39:43.022 --> 39:44.922
when we go over there.

39:44.958 --> 39:48.926
- Just a matter of time.
- That's what I told him.

39:48.962 --> 39:50.995
You're not taking that home,
right?

40:06.045 --> 40:08.980
I think that's Gruzin-McDickoff
or whatever.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.915
Let me see the pictures.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.288
Yeah, Gruzinski.

40:17.323 --> 40:20.358
8:12.

40:20.393 --> 40:21.959
No kids, right?

40:21.995 --> 40:23.961
Uh...

40:23.997 --> 40:26.330
Yeah.
Wife's here.

40:26.366 --> 40:29.033
Last job in Buenos Aires.

40:29.068 --> 40:33.371
Our teams have this guy down
as probable non-intel.

40:33.406 --> 40:36.007
Panin just went back in.

40:52.292 --> 40:56.994
So, the CIA is planning
on squeezing Burov in Moscow

40:57.030 --> 40:59.263
with the tape I made.

40:59.299 --> 41:00.331
You have a problem
with that?

41:00.366 --> 41:02.333
It's not right.

41:02.368 --> 41:04.936
And it's not gonna work.

41:07.040 --> 41:10.208
I talked to the Deputy AG
about it.

41:10.243 --> 41:12.176
Didn't get anywhere.

41:12.212 --> 41:13.878
What'd he say?

41:13.913 --> 41:16.280
He said he understood,
but it's the CIA.

41:16.316 --> 41:18.883
They're gonna do
what they're gonna do.

41:21.087 --> 41:22.954
Side of the job.

41:22.989 --> 41:24.322
Yeah.

41:24.357 --> 41:26.290
Big side.

41:30.063 --> 41:32.964
So, how about
the girl from the gym?

41:32.999 --> 41:34.899
You gonna
ask her out again?

41:34.934 --> 41:36.167
Already did.

41:36.202 --> 41:38.035
Oh, Stan Beeman.

41:38.071 --> 41:39.971
Yeah.

41:40.006 --> 41:41.105
So, where to next?

41:41.140 --> 41:42.940
I don't know.

41:42.976 --> 41:45.209
Someplace nice,
but not too nice

41:45.245 --> 41:47.011
so there's room
for growth.

41:47.046 --> 41:49.013
[ Chuckles ]

41:49.048 --> 41:51.148
What about one of those
Bread Oven places?

41:51.184 --> 41:53.017
There's a new one
on Pennsylvania Avenue.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.285
I took a date there
last week.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.120
And?

41:56.155 --> 42:00.324
They have
a see-through grand piano.

42:00.360 --> 42:02.860
What else
you need to know?

42:24.918 --> 42:26.217
What?

42:29.289 --> 42:33.057
I'm sick of treating her
like a goddamn kid.

42:36.129 --> 42:38.195
[ Sighs ]

42:44.237 --> 42:46.203
[ Knock on door ]

42:46.239 --> 42:47.972
Come in.

42:50.109 --> 42:51.909
Hey.

42:54.347 --> 42:56.314
I was just, uh,
going to bed.

42:56.349 --> 43:00.084
Uh, we just need
to talk to you for a minute.

43:00.119 --> 43:03.321
Is it about Matthew?

43:03.356 --> 43:05.156
I don't want to.

43:05.191 --> 43:09.060
We need a minute.

43:09.095 --> 43:11.929
We can't stop you
from seeing him,

43:11.965 --> 43:15.333
but we can help you
manage things

43:15.368 --> 43:17.234
so the relationship
is safer.

43:17.270 --> 43:19.070
Mom.

43:19.105 --> 43:21.072
Please, listen to me.
Believe me.

43:21.107 --> 43:24.942
I am not, I would not ever,
ever tell him anything.

43:24.978 --> 43:26.344
I promise. I swear.

43:26.379 --> 43:28.346
How do you know, Paige?

43:28.381 --> 43:30.181
Sex muddies things.

43:30.216 --> 43:31.349
I'm not having sex.

43:31.384 --> 43:35.019
Yeah, but you might.

43:35.054 --> 43:39.023
And if you do, you're going to
feel and say things to Matthew

43:39.058 --> 43:42.860
that you've never felt
or said to anyone before.

43:45.098 --> 43:46.931
How are you gonna
handle things then?

43:46.966 --> 43:48.899
I...

43:48.935 --> 43:51.268
You have to think
about that.

43:51.304 --> 43:53.004
I know you don't want
to hurt us,

43:53.039 --> 43:54.839
but it can happen
without you even realizing.

43:54.874 --> 43:56.107
You wouldn't even know
you've said it.

43:56.142 --> 43:57.942
All right, all right,
I'll just--

43:57.977 --> 43:59.910
- I'll stop seeing him, okay?
- Paige, listen, we're actually--

43:59.946 --> 44:01.245
I'll just be alone
for the rest of my life.

44:01.280 --> 44:03.214
Would that make you
feel better?

44:03.249 --> 44:05.216
Are you finished?

44:08.287 --> 44:12.923
There's something
we can show you, a technique

44:12.959 --> 44:15.960
to help you
keep your emotions in check,

44:15.995 --> 44:19.096
to help you stay in control.

44:19.132 --> 44:23.134
If you can learn this thing,
really master it,

44:23.169 --> 44:25.936
you can keep seeing him

44:25.972 --> 44:27.872
if that's what you want.

44:31.144 --> 44:33.911
Do you want us
to show you?

44:38.017 --> 44:39.950
Okay.

44:46.059 --> 44:48.125
Before we start,

44:48.161 --> 44:51.962
if you ever feel that you're
losing control with Matthew,

44:51.998 --> 44:53.964
really losing control,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.067
just tell him you need some time
to think.

44:56.102 --> 45:01.305
Then you come find us, and we'll
figure out what to do together.

45:01.340 --> 45:02.907
Okay?

45:02.942 --> 45:04.041
Sit down.

45:15.188 --> 45:19.056
Now, if you're with him

45:19.092 --> 45:23.327
and things start to get
uncomfortable or go bad,

45:23.362 --> 45:29.166
you're feeling overwhelmed
or emotional or uncertain,

45:29.202 --> 45:33.070
rub your thumb
and your forefinger together

45:33.106 --> 45:37.241
and picture me and your father

45:37.276 --> 45:42.046
to help remind yourself of who
you are and where you come from.

45:46.185 --> 45:48.953
It's just a little thing,
but if you practice it,

45:48.988 --> 45:51.155
it'll always
be there for you.

46:01.100 --> 46:04.902
That's good.

46:04.937 --> 46:06.303
Yeah.
