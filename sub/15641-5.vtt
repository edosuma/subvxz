WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:03.337
Previously on Hit the Floor...

00:03.462 --> 00:05.305
I went to Mia's apartment.
What was she into?

00:05.422 --> 00:08.767
There was nothing you or anyone else
could have done to help Mia.

00:08.926 --> 00:12.055
I find that uniform's turning out to be
a bigger pain in the ass than I thought.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.223
- Can we please just talk about this?
- Olivia.

00:14.389 --> 00:17.233
The person I need to have
a conversation with is my daughter.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.894
She has moved out of my house.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.234
I grabbed my stuff
and I haven't spoken to her since.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.818
You want to dig up the bones
from that night?

00:22.940 --> 00:25.113
-It's not gonna happen.
- I'm talking. You're listening.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.027
I'm supposed to be doing
this super-smoking

00:27.194 --> 00:28.912
solo shot and it's not happening.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.574
- When are you all instinct?
- Dancing.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.835
When I dance, I just go.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.745
So go.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.710
Guess who learned
how to be sexy today.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.174
I love you,
and I want you here for good.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.385
This was nice.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.100
Can I get the emergency contact
for Ahsha Hayes?

00:50.259 --> 00:52.307
<i>I have a German Vega, boyfriend.</i>

00:52.469 --> 00:55.473
That's all I needed.

01:19.580 --> 01:23.175
The Devils catch fire
to win 109 to 105!

01:23.333 --> 01:26.928
Thank you, Los Angeles.
Good night!

01:30.299 --> 01:33.018
Ladies. Ladies.

01:33.176 --> 01:36.146
I couldn't be more pleased with
how you guys looked out there tonight.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.312
Now, I know this week has been a haul,
but I need you find another gear

01:39.474 --> 01:41.476
because it's Devil's Charity weekend.

01:41.643 --> 01:45.113
Tomorrow, you'll be performing
on the Santa Monica Pier.

01:46.481 --> 01:49.985
And this Sunday is the formal
charity party and silent auction.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.325
This year, the money is going to go
to the athletic departments

01:52.487 --> 01:54.410
of needy little SoCal high schools.

01:54.573 --> 01:59.625
So how much the organisation brings in
is a direct reflection on us.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.663
Exactly, so we're gonna need you
to get out there

02:01.830 --> 02:03.207
and charm the donations out of people.

02:03.373 --> 02:07.549
I can charm the pants off people.
The pockets are easier to pick that way.

02:07.711 --> 02:11.841
Let me remind you, the Devil's Charity
supports local high schools.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.135
So we're doing this
for the children, Kyle.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.110
Ahsha.

02:23.268 --> 02:27.444
Hey, that was real nice dancing
out there tonight.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.654
Thanks. Nice win.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.787
Coach.

02:36.990 --> 02:41.837
Hey, looks like we're both leaving.
You maybe want to grab a bite to eat?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.544
Actually, I have plans tonight
with my boyfriend.

02:44.706 --> 02:48.176
He's a high school basketball coach.
They had a game tonight too.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.179
- Really? Well, where does he coach?
- Thomas Jefferson.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.137
Well, let me know if he ever wants
to discuss defence,

02:54.299 --> 02:58.099
'cause the only D that these pros
are interested in is dunking.

02:58.220 --> 03:02.726
I'm free tomorrow
if you want to talk or something.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.565
Yeah, we have team meetings
tomorrow night.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.105
Okay. See you later, then.

03:17.114 --> 03:20.709
Oh, before I forget, I need you
to release Oscar's VIP auction seats.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.869
He's not coming?

03:23.078 --> 03:27.549
No, he's come to one charity event
in 13 years and it was by accident.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.882
He was so pissed
when he saw all those sick kids.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.593
What about that?
Should we include it?

03:33.755 --> 03:36.133
That is Mia's.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.643
We've gotten so many emails
about her.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.554
People miss her.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.723
I thought for sure
she'd be the next Jelena.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.445
Everyone did. You know,
it was her decision to take off,

03:48.603 --> 03:53.074
so if she didn't want her uniform,
maybe somebody else will.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.949
Go ahead and preview these online

03:56.111 --> 03:58.113
and start setting up
the display tables, okay?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.245
Honey, he)'-

04:05.412 --> 04:09.007
I'm actually here
to just get more of my stuff.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.964
Okay. Well, I just saw you on TV.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.471
They had a close-up of you
doing the pancake chug with body roll.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.005
You looked great.

04:19.551 --> 04:23.601
Hey, I was thinking...
maybe we could finally talk.

04:24.556 --> 04:27.480
Fine. Talk.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.315
You know I love you.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.782
- And every decision that I've made--
- No. Not that.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.530
Tell me why you ran.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.121
Tell my why you didn't tell me
who my father was my entire life.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.661
Ahsha, I need to know that we're okay
before I get to that.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.706
I need you to get to that
before I know we're okay.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.300
- Ahsha--
- You're not ready to talk.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.436
You're working with Olivia
on the charity weekend, right?

05:07.599 --> 05:09.397
We wanted to add a school to the list.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.984
It shouldn't be a problem.
I'll just have to clear it with the boss.

05:13.104 --> 05:18.031
You know what? It's already done. We
thought it would be nice to slip them in.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.945
What's the name of the school?

05:20.111 --> 05:23.581
It's a high school in Lennox.
Thomas Jefferson.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.583
Got it.

05:40.382 --> 05:44.888
Ahsh, you are never gonna believe
what happened tonight.

05:45.053 --> 05:49.729
Coach Vega won his game against highly
favoured Crenshaw by six points?

05:49.891 --> 05:53.236
- Oh, babe, you checked my score.
- I'm so proud of you.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.772
Wish I could have been there
for the big upset.

05:54.938 --> 05:58.408
And I wish I could have been at
the arena to see my girl rock the floor.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.786
I hate that we missed
each other's events.

06:00.902 --> 06:05.032
We'll get a chance to make up for it.
We actually get an our event.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.700
What are you talking about?

06:06.825 --> 06:09.704
Well, Thomas Jefferson got picked
as one of the schools

06:09.870 --> 06:11.918
getting cash
for the Devil's Charity weekend.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.673
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.551
I don't remember hearing anything
about your school.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.088
Wait, so you're coming
to the formal auction party?

06:19.254 --> 06:20.972
Well, the money goes
to the PE Department

06:21.131 --> 06:25.511
and so do two tickets,
so I get to go twice.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.975
I get to show you off at work.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.607
Oh, babe,
I don't think I can afford a tux.

06:30.765 --> 06:35.020
So? We're not attending
the Academy Awards yet.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.694
Really? You're okay with me
going in my picture day suit?

06:37.856 --> 06:40.700
I prefer your birthday suit.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.281
Okay.

06:42.444 --> 06:46.824
- Oh, babe, you need a shower.
- Yeah, you're right.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.584
I'm covered in four quarters
of high school boy funk.

07:08.386 --> 07:11.014
Yes. Yes.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.522
- Yeah!
- All right. I'm done.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.689
Hey, after I intro you guys,
I got to bounce.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.357
You're leaving before the dance? Why?

07:20.523 --> 07:22.116
I just got some things to do.
I'll see you for dinner.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.528
- Thing to do like what?
- Stop asking questions, woman.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.744
- Stop being cagey.
- Good afternoon, Devil's Nation!

07:30.659 --> 07:32.832
No, no, no, I am here to clap for you,

07:32.994 --> 07:37.249
this year's Devils Foundation
Student All-Stars!

07:37.415 --> 07:40.919
Now let's get this party started
with our very own world famous,

07:41.086 --> 07:43.930
Los Angeles Devil Girls!

09:43.875 --> 09:47.049
Oh, that looks more complicated
than the Princeton of fence.

09:47.212 --> 09:52.639
You have no idea. VIP seating hierarchy
is the new bane of my existence.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.563
Well, here. May I?

09:57.555 --> 10:02.652
See, these two should be seated as
far away as possible from one another.

10:02.811 --> 10:06.941
He doesn't care where he sits
and she likes to be near the bar.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.820
All right. This actually works.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.949
It's all about timing and player spacing.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.119
You just keep helping me.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.879
That shark lawyer you referred me to,
she sent Jesse

10:22.038 --> 10:25.884
an even bigger, scarier letter
than the one he gave me.

10:26.042 --> 10:30.513
Yeah, I remember
those 20 pages of terror well.

10:30.672 --> 10:34.802
I'm sorry you were on the receiving end,
but I just can't thank you enough.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.970
Jesse is the one running scared now.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.060
Happy to help.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.020
Maybe there's something
you can help me with.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.863
Of course. What's up?

10:48.523 --> 10:51.902
There's this person,

10:52.068 --> 10:56.198
who I just don't seem
to be able to talk to.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.577
Is it a girl?

11:00.702 --> 11:05.799
Yes. Yes. And I've been trying
to connect with her,

11:05.957 --> 11:10.463
but I just keep hitting a wall.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.308
Have you spent any time with her?

11:15.466 --> 11:17.059
Not much, no.

11:18.845 --> 11:24.648
You're a great guy, Pete.
Any girl would want to get to know you.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.318
Just relax and be yourself.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.743
When it feels right, make your move.

11:35.820 --> 11:39.666
So you're saying it's all about timing
and player spacing?

11:39.782 --> 11:41.784
Exactly.

11:46.581 --> 11:50.802
You should think about
a career in coaching. Thank you.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.642
And this is for a friend.

12:05.808 --> 12:09.608
Look at that. She's already turning
into a fan favourite.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.274
You must be the German.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.864
I'm Jelena Howard,
captain of the Devil Girls.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.031
I know who you are.

12:21.407 --> 12:25.537
It's a tough gig.
She really is lucky to have you.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.040
Look, what you did to Ahsha was foul.

12:28.206 --> 12:32.837
She may have to have some working
relationship with you, but I don't.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.176
So find someone else to mess with.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.888
I'm not all bad.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.098
I'm pretty good with introductions.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.644
Derek, come meet somebody.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.900
Derek, this is German.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.652
What's up, man?
What's going on with you, bro?

12:49.811 --> 12:51.939
It's great to meet you, man.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.157
German is Ahsha's boyfriend.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.367
Obviously, you're a DG fan.
What do you think about the Devils?

13:00.530 --> 13:02.624
It's been my team since I was four.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.414
I mean, everyone knows we got
the best guard in the league.

13:05.576 --> 13:10.082
Nobody cleans up the glass better
than the Roman Emperor, for real.

13:10.248 --> 13:14.378
- Nice.
- Roman. They're ready for you.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.550
Duty calls.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.134
Derek is an excellent coach, too.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.772
He coaches ball?
How's he find time to do all that?

13:25.930 --> 13:29.810
Actually, I was talking about him
coaching Ahsha at the calendar shoot.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.896
He helped her nail it.

13:43.489 --> 13:48.336
Did you see the crowd?
People were asking for my autograph.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.838
You didn't tell me that Derek
was at your calendar shoot.

13:50.997 --> 13:54.342
- Yeah, it was at his house.
- It was at his house?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.093
It wasn't a big deal.

13:56.252 --> 14:00.302
You were at Derek Roman's house in
a string bikini and that's not a big deal?

14:00.423 --> 14:02.801
- I was working.
- Does he like you?

14:03.885 --> 14:05.887
Derek likes everyone.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.148
You know what I mean, Ahsha.

14:08.264 --> 14:13.020
German, it doesn't matter.
He doesn't matter because I'm with you.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.442
I love you.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.069
I'm sorry, babe.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.079
I'm tripping.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.500
- Don't trip, Chicken Strip.
- Really?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.679
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.682
Is Terrence here?
Karen said she saw him walk in.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.560
He was here about an hour ago.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.597
Everything okay?

14:49.764 --> 14:53.359
Today is our anniversary.
We were supposed to meet for dinner.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.574
Terrence was here all afternoon,
taking meetings with Oscar

15:00.733 --> 15:02.610
and a bunch of other heavy hitters.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.989
Thanks.

15:14.247 --> 15:17.467
Okay. We have to stop meeting
like this.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.961
I Googled you.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.677
Well, I Googled you too.

15:23.673 --> 15:27.268
You played with Michael Jordan,
very cool.

15:27.427 --> 15:31.933
And you went to my Alma Mater.
We're both Gauchos.

15:32.098 --> 15:36.194
There was this big mural of you in
the event centre where I used to cheer.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.448
- What did you major in?
- Double major.

15:40.606 --> 15:44.156
Business administration and dance.
You?

15:44.318 --> 15:47.868
Basketball.
- So did German.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.408
I remember watching
that championship game

15:50.575 --> 15:53.124
where you massacred San Antonio.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.415
That... Wait, please tell me
you weren't a San Antonio fan.

15:56.581 --> 15:59.505
- Of course not.
- Good.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.841
That actually was the game
where I really blew out my knee.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.553
I mean, I've never been the same since.

16:05.715 --> 16:09.265
It was also where you kind of looked
like a werewolf.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.605
Those sideburns, seriously?
What was up with all that hair?

16:12.763 --> 16:14.936
Grunge.
Grunge was very big back then.

16:17.727 --> 16:22.824
Would you like to have dinner
with me on Tuesday or...?

16:22.940 --> 16:24.567
- Sure.
- Great.

16:24.734 --> 16:29.205
How about... the Counter over on Fifth?
Like eight o'clock or something.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.162
-It's right down the street.
- See you there.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.498
Okay.

16:42.460 --> 16:45.179
You've been on the phone all morning.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.682
You were nowhere to be found
yesterday. What's going on?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.387
Just a ton of meetings.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.644
So I've heard.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.567
You ditched our anniversary dinner
to meet with Oscar.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.154
- Are you injured?
- What? No.

17:02.313 --> 17:06.284
It's business. It's investments,
shoe-line endorsement stuff.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.616
It all exploded at the same time.

17:09.779 --> 17:14.079
I'm sorry about last night.
I will make it up to you.

17:15.076 --> 17:19.205
Fine. Are you coming
to the charity auction tonight?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.374
Hell, yeah.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.130
You're so cute
when you're worried about me.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.469
I'm not worried. I'm annoyed.

17:29.632 --> 17:32.556
Now that you mention it,
it's kind of the same look.

17:37.348 --> 17:38.770
Are you sure you're not injured?

17:41.852 --> 17:44.401
How can I prove it to you?

17:49.110 --> 17:51.112
All right, then.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.633
- Good evening, everyone.
- Good evening!

18:07.795 --> 18:10.173
On behalf of everyone
in the Devil's organisation,

18:10.339 --> 18:13.468
welcome to our annual charity night.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.599
All of your donations go to
several Southland high schools

18:18.764 --> 18:22.610
in need of an assist,
so please text a cash donation,

18:22.768 --> 18:26.068
or bid on one of the fantastic items
at the silent auction.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.949
Now, please help me welcome
your MC for the evening.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.203
He was the voice of LA basketball
for 50 years.

18:32.361 --> 18:36.958
Devils legend, Mel O'Grane!

18:39.660 --> 18:42.880
Are you ready to shake and bake, LA?

18:44.582 --> 18:49.964
Whoa! Someone already bid 40 grand
on two tickets for the All-Star game?

18:50.129 --> 18:55.056
That's more than I make in a year.
Babe, you sure I look okay?

18:55.217 --> 18:59.222
No one looks better than you in a suit
and I love this tie you splurged on.

19:01.849 --> 19:06.821
I'm gonna go get us something to drink.
I'll be right back.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.492
What are you doing here?

19:11.651 --> 19:15.076
German invited me.
He had an extra ticket, so...

19:15.237 --> 19:17.239
Ahsha, we can't keep going on
like this.

19:17.406 --> 19:21.001
You can end this at any time
by answering my questions.

19:22.036 --> 19:24.585
This isn't the time or place
for that conversation.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.624
You always want to play by your rules.

19:26.791 --> 19:29.340
Well, this time,
I think you need to play by mine.

19:29.460 --> 19:33.510
You did a bad thing, and you're trying
to gloss it over with I love yous?

19:33.673 --> 19:37.803
Until you're ready to give me the facts,
we don't have anything to talk about.

19:42.390 --> 19:45.109
I haven't seen you donate anything yet.
Desiree.

19:45.267 --> 19:49.898
Mr Cuban here would like to donate
$50,000 to a very worthy cause.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.866
And Coach Davenport
would love to match that donation.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.289
That hurts me a lot more
than it hurts you.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.997
Yes, it does.

20:04.245 --> 20:08.375
<i>Shiranu ga hotoke.</i>

20:09.542 --> 20:11.385
What happened?
Did he have a stroke?

20:11.502 --> 20:14.972
I think that's Japanese. He mentioned
something about World War ll earlier.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.509
And then bang! Bang!

20:17.675 --> 20:20.053
Oh, good God.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.563
I warned Oscar this would happen.
Mel's only good for 15 minutes.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.316
He's like 100 years old.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.353
- This is getting real ugly, real fast.
- You wake up in some military hospital.

20:28.519 --> 20:31.068
I need someone to get up on that stage,
drag him down by his diapers,

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
and light a fire under this crowd.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.367
You know,
I'm pretty good at lighting fires.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.494
I know what kind of fires
you like to light, Kyle.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.530
I'm not looking to burn this place
to the ground.

20:39.697 --> 20:42.701
Olivia, it's like you think
I don't know etiquette.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.999
I graduated first in my class
in Miss Darby's school of charm.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.505
I even skipped a year.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.374
Well, Mr Darby had a little crush
on me and...

20:50.499 --> 20:53.673
Actually, this story takes
a weird detour.

20:53.836 --> 20:58.342
In my day, women were wives, period!

20:58.466 --> 21:00.764
- No.
- Even the butch ones!

21:00.926 --> 21:03.770
- But hey, if that's working for you--
- Get in there.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.808
- Put on a pair of heels and heel.
- Go.

21:09.226 --> 21:13.026
In order to get them all revved up,
I need to be revved up.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.659
Oh, okay. What's it going to take
to get you revved up, Kyle?

21:16.817 --> 21:20.071
- Your H team.
- My what?

21:20.237 --> 21:23.662
Your Hollywood team. All the people
that keep you looking so good.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.377
You give me your H team,
I'll save the shindig.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.162
I want your plastic surgeon,
your colourist--

21:28.329 --> 21:32.459
- I don't have a plastic surgeon.
- Excuse me, Native Americans...

21:32.583 --> 21:36.053
Okay, fine, I'll give you my colourist,
my eyebrow lady,

21:36.212 --> 21:39.807
six sessions with my personal trainer
and my dermatologist.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.512
- Deal.
- Great.

21:41.675 --> 21:45.680
Now, go get Father Christmas off
the stage and bring in some real dough.

21:45.846 --> 21:50.101
Hey, Kyle, keep this PG.
Hey, wait, remember the children.

21:50.267 --> 21:55.148
Gaming casinos. lndian's revenge.
Don't get me started. Just do not get...

21:55.314 --> 21:57.487
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:57.650 --> 22:02.121
Ladies and gentlemen, are we ready
to have some fun tonight?

22:08.828 --> 22:11.206
What do you think you're doing?

22:12.456 --> 22:14.800
Philanthropy.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.883
Don't you want to give to charity
and dance with your girl?

22:18.045 --> 22:21.640
- You know she has a boyfriend.
- Yeah, he's a nice guy.

22:21.799 --> 22:26.054
Gym teacher.
Not exactly competition for you.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.348
Or is he?

22:29.515 --> 22:32.815
I can take your name off if you want.
Maybe you're not feeling philanthropic.

22:32.977 --> 22:36.322
Leave it. It's just a dance.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.002
Sloane?

22:55.165 --> 22:59.420
Hey. What are you doing up here with
the sad face, hiding in the corner?

22:59.545 --> 23:02.765
Well, you're glowing enough
for the both of us.

23:02.923 --> 23:06.348
- What, did you win the lottery?
- Sort of.

23:07.511 --> 23:11.357
And I made some headway with Ahsha.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.563
Talked to her for five minutes
in the hallway

23:13.726 --> 23:17.105
-and she agreed to have dinner with me.
- Well, that's progress.

23:17.271 --> 23:21.447
I guess she looked me up on the internet
and saw my bad hair days.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.703
Chia Pet Pete.

23:23.861 --> 23:26.205
I was kind of going more
for Eddie Vedder.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.991
And you wound up with Eddie Munster.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.508
You want to dance?

23:40.210 --> 23:43.805
No. I'm not up... I'm not up for it.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.726
Well, you know,
that was never my thing.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.846
<i>But you...</i>

23:51.013 --> 23:57.191
I remember you used to dance like
a tornado that never touched down.

23:57.353 --> 24:00.778
I used to literally have
to drag you off the floor.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.614
That was a long time ago.

24:03.776 --> 24:07.155
I just...
I'm not up for dancing tonight.

24:09.239 --> 24:12.584
I think I'm going to go home.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.050
Well, lookie here.

24:24.213 --> 24:28.343
We just got a $25,000 text donation
from Jason B.

24:28.509 --> 24:32.139
JB, honey, introduce yourself
so I can thank you properly.

24:32.262 --> 24:35.141
Oh, he is cute!
Okay, you know what?

24:35.307 --> 24:39.107
Jason is too good a catch
and silent auctions are too quiet.

24:39.269 --> 24:43.069
Uh-huh! Ladies, who wants
to go on a date with Jason?

24:43.232 --> 24:44.950
Start the bidding at $200.
I have 200.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.908
Who will give me 300, 300, 300.
Good, 400, 400, 400.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.697
I got 500
from the gentleman in the corner.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.996
Ladies, you got a competition.
$600, now, good, good, good.

24:53.158 --> 24:56.128
Can I get 700, 700, 700?
800, 800, 800, 900, 900, 900.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.835
$900! Going once, going twice!

24:58.998 --> 25:02.593
And sold to the desperate single lady
at table 8.

25:05.421 --> 25:09.471
Now, here's something I know everyone,
including myself, wants to take home.

25:09.633 --> 25:13.888
It's the amazingly talented
and gorgeous Akon!

25:19.184 --> 25:20.982
Let's not beat around the bush.

25:21.103 --> 25:24.949
I know you own a diamond mine
in South Africa.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.284
How many carats you got on you?

25:27.443 --> 25:29.866
Don't make me say
all 12 of your birth names.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.582
You are a Devil girl.

25:33.741 --> 25:36.369
Give it up. Come on.

25:37.786 --> 25:41.666
- You don't take no often, do you?
- Yes, is so much more fun.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.425
- Well, have fun.
- I will.

25:45.419 --> 25:48.548
Start the bidding at 20,000. I've got 20.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.513
Who'll give me 25, 25? Yes!
Keep it going!

25:51.675 --> 25:55.396
This is for the starving children
who need their cleft palates fixed.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.524
Wasn't this auction for
high school PE departments?

25:58.682 --> 26:00.650
I don't think anybody cares.

26:01.727 --> 26:03.479
Sloane.

26:03.645 --> 26:09.448
Hey, I didn't know you were coming.
Are you leaving already?

26:09.610 --> 26:12.329
Oh, I have to get up early
for work, so...

26:14.615 --> 26:19.997
Olivia, thank you for the photo
you slid under my door.

26:21.038 --> 26:24.838
Sure. I thought you might want
to see what Ahsha was up to.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.503
She's like you, all over again.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.262
Oh, God, I hope not.

26:30.339 --> 26:34.719
Sloane, everyone makes mistakes.
Even you.

26:34.885 --> 26:40.437
She wants to know the blow-by-blow.
I don't think I can do it.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.727
I've seen Ahsha
angry at you this whole time,

26:43.894 --> 26:47.148
but you know what I haven't seen
for one second?

26:47.314 --> 26:49.362
That she doesn't love you.

26:50.776 --> 26:55.748
She may think of you differently
after you tell her what happened,

26:55.864 --> 26:59.243
but I know she's still gonna love you.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.967
And here we have
an authentic Devils Girl uniform

27:11.130 --> 27:13.679
worn by Mia,
a member of last year's team.

27:13.841 --> 27:18.312
I see the current bid on the sheet
is at $850.

27:18.470 --> 27:22.600
Can anyone give me 1,000?
Yes. 1,500, I have two.

27:22.766 --> 27:26.646
2,500? Three? Now I've got four.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.814
Akon, baby, help me out.
Drive this baby up for me, would you?

27:28.981 --> 27:32.110
Whatever you want, Baby. 5,000.

27:32.276 --> 27:35.029
- You are looking beautiful, Omotola.
- Thank you, girl.

27:35.195 --> 27:38.790
Welcome. Did you hear that?
Five! Is it quitting time? Not yet!

27:38.949 --> 27:41.498
Six! Thank heaven for seven.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.381
Congratulations.
She's yours to play with for $7,000.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.219
What are you doing?

28:02.347 --> 28:04.941
You want me to stop
treating you like a child?

28:05.976 --> 28:09.981
Well, here goes. Woman to woman...

28:11.023 --> 28:12.741
Ask your first question.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.994
WhYd You run?

28:15.152 --> 28:19.999
I walked in on your father having sex
with my best friend. Next question.

28:21.575 --> 28:25.000
He said you two loved each other.
Did you love him?

28:25.162 --> 28:28.962
I not only loved him, he was my drug.

28:29.124 --> 28:32.970
And I couldn't think straight when
I was around him. Next question.

28:34.546 --> 28:38.972
Why didn't you try to fix it? If you
loved him, even after what he did,

28:39.134 --> 28:42.058
how could you just leave
and not talk to him again?

28:44.181 --> 28:48.027
Pete was a player. I was a dancer.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.946
Players can do whatever they want.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.658
They can party themselves
into the ground

28:54.816 --> 28:58.912
and the organisation will always
be there to pick them up, protect them.

28:59.071 --> 29:03.497
They're multi-million-dollar investments.
Players are gods.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.584
Dancers are goods.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.799
We have no safety net.

29:10.958 --> 29:14.007
We get dragged down, we stay down.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.718
Okay, but still--

29:21.051 --> 29:24.225
I got so dragged down...

29:27.057 --> 29:29.401
that I couldn't claw my way out.

29:31.228 --> 29:36.610
And even if Pete had wanted to pull
himself out of the party, he couldn't.

29:38.026 --> 29:41.200
And I couldn't pull myself from him.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.286
I did...

29:48.370 --> 29:51.089
so many things I wasn't proud of.

29:53.375 --> 29:56.003
So many things.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.263
Did you do drugs?

30:01.091 --> 30:03.719
- Yes.
- Cocaine?

30:06.346 --> 30:07.973
Yes.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.484
- Crack?
- Ahsha!

30:13.020 --> 30:15.398
I've tried everything.

30:22.195 --> 30:26.701
You always ask me
about the '92 playoffs.

30:27.659 --> 30:31.709
- You said they were a whirlwind.
- I was blacked out.

30:33.540 --> 30:37.761
I can't tell you all the rooms I was in...

30:38.962 --> 30:41.340
all the things I did if I wanted to.

30:45.761 --> 30:50.608
If I would have stayed with Pete,
I would have died.

30:53.643 --> 30:56.021
Getting pregnant saved my life.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.486
You...

31:02.652 --> 31:04.620
saved my life.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.055
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time to announce

31:30.180 --> 31:33.059
the single biggest auction bid
of the night.

31:33.183 --> 31:37.404
The item was a dance
with Devil Girl Ahsha Hayes.

31:42.150 --> 31:48.374
Oh, wait,
the amount donated was $100,000.

31:49.408 --> 31:53.538
And the bidder,
our very own Derek Roman.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.585
Come and claim your prize, D-Ro.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.125
What do I do?

31:58.291 --> 32:00.544
It's okay. Go dance.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.724
What are you doing? Are you trying
to completely embarrass my boyfriend?

32:13.890 --> 32:17.485
Well, you kept turning me down,
so I had to take desperate measures.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.988
I'll make it painless.

32:20.981 --> 32:23.860
- Where should I put my hands?
- On my waist.

32:23.984 --> 32:27.830
- Any lower and I'll knee you in the nuts.
- You're the boss.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.542
How's it going, beautiful?

33:23.960 --> 33:27.510
I don't know where you've been all night,
but I'm over it.

33:27.672 --> 33:32.724
Oh, don't be mad.
You want to dance?

33:32.886 --> 33:35.605
Terrence, you know me.

33:36.848 --> 33:40.773
You know I'll figure it out, so you'd
best tell me what's going on right now.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.149
All right.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.693
You win.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.367
Good evening, everyone.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.586
I hope you all are having
a great time tonight.

34:01.498 --> 34:04.217
I have a little announcement to make.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.971
Now, I have a passion besides basketball
that I would like to introduce you to.

34:08.129 --> 34:12.179
It took some finagling. Actually,
it took a lot of finagling to finish,

34:12.300 --> 34:15.053
but I finally managed
to get it open tonight.

34:15.219 --> 34:19.020
Ladies and gentlemen,
my new restaurant in Beverly Hills.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.609
Jelena's.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.904
All the delicious food and drink
tonight was catered by Jelena's,

34:32.070 --> 34:35.495
so what do y'all think
about the tri-tip sliders?

34:37.367 --> 34:42.464
Good, good, good. In that case, I hope
you all make the trip down to Rodeo.

34:42.581 --> 34:49.054
Now, I hate to whisk my lady away
from such a great party...

34:50.922 --> 34:54.301
but it turns out we have
an anniversary dinner to get to.

34:59.347 --> 35:01.566
Is a day late okay?

35:03.059 --> 35:04.902
Let's go.

35:12.902 --> 35:18.375
I said, if that's a backdoor cut,
then I am Kareem Abdul-Jabber.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.535
Whoa, hey, wow.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.539
- Don't you look lovely tonight?
- Thanks.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.837
You think maybe we should try
Jelena's restaurant on Tuesday?

35:27.000 --> 35:30.174
Maybe Terrence will give us
a good table. What do you think?

35:32.172 --> 35:36.302
Before I knew who my father was,
I could make him anyone I wanted.

35:36.426 --> 35:39.851
Sometimes, I would fantasise
he was a doctor, a lawyer,

35:40.013 --> 35:42.357
a race car driver.

35:42.515 --> 35:47.066
Now that I know the reality,
I don't want to know any more.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.608
Let's just keep things
the way they were.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.579
But they weren't anywhere.

36:09.042 --> 36:13.593
Honey, you most definitely
are gonna get to smack that!

36:20.178 --> 36:21.976
Oh, no.

36:23.765 --> 36:26.393
What the hell. You paid for it.

36:31.731 --> 36:36.578
Well, hello, Mel O'Grane.
You're looking mighty fine.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.909
You ever heard of Anna Nicole Smith?

36:46.746 --> 36:48.965
He might be dead, y'all.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.944
Hey. What's wrong?

37:15.859 --> 37:17.406
You want to dance?

37:20.029 --> 37:22.248
I'd love to.

37:49.684 --> 37:54.155
That's pretty generous of you.
$100,000 for charity.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.692
Yeah, for charity.

38:28.890 --> 38:33.612
Hey, dead-end.
The microphone's still out there.

38:39.359 --> 38:40.906
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor...</i>

38:41.069 --> 38:43.492
The Santa Ana winds
always lead to hot sex.

38:43.655 --> 38:47.285
Someone's hooking up.
Keep an eye out for guilty faces.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.248
You told me it was okay
to dance with him!

38:49.410 --> 38:52.584
- You should have stopped yourself!
- Are you kidding me?

38:55.041 --> 38:56.384
I'm looking for Ahsha.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.344
I knew the insecure boyfriend
was gonna show up at some point.

39:02.423 --> 39:05.723
Get the power back on and get it on now.
There is no or else.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.638
What did you think, that I was just gonna
do you right here in the elevator?

39:08.805 --> 39:10.478
Fine, you know what? Yeah.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.768
I want to have sex with you.
Deal with it.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.778
- Who's there?
- Mia.
