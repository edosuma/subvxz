and before you know it,
I'm in the room...

37:06.888 --> 37:10.950
and they're doing
something to me.

37:11.025 --> 37:16.486
And then I'm back in my car, and two days
have gone by, and I'm in West Virginia.

37:16.564 --> 37:21.263
I would've written the entire thing off
as an acid flashback.

37:21.335 --> 37:24.794
Then my doctor told me
the cancer was gone.

37:26.040 --> 37:29.499
It was bone marrow,
terminal.

37:29.577 --> 37:32.103
A year to live and, poof,
it's gone.

37:32.180 --> 37:34.615
And you're trying to...

37:34.682 --> 37:38.516
re-establish contact
with... the aliens?

37:38.586 --> 37:41.487
- I have to.
- What about that?

37:41.556 --> 37:45.117
That I bought- I don't know--
three years ago...

37:45.193 --> 37:48.857
from some guy who deals in
supposed alien artifacts.

37:48.930 --> 37:51.900
I thought it was
a piece of junk...

37:51.966 --> 37:54.697
and then on May 14,
that thingjust came to life.

37:54.769 --> 37:57.363
It sent out
this-this pulse.

37:57.438 --> 38:01.739
So, I- I hired a team, had them check
the entire radio telescope network...

38:01.809 --> 38:06.508
for anything unusual,
and they found something.

38:06.581 --> 38:08.515
Asignal, Max.

38:08.583 --> 38:11.814
<i>A strange, high-energy
microwave signal...</i>

38:11.886 --> 38:14.685
<i>that corresponded
exactly with what I saw.</i>

38:14.755 --> 38:18.714
- <i>And you know where this signal came 290m?</i>
- <i>Roswell.</i>

38:18.793 --> 38:23.629
Exactly. Do you know
what this means, Max?

38:23.698 --> 38:27.328
Aliens. I mean, not like
they're walking among us...

38:27.401 --> 38:30.769
<i>or anything stupid like that,
but they're actually making contact...</i>

38:30.838 --> 38:33.466
with people right here
in Roswell.

38:35.343 --> 38:37.641
Now, what do you
think of that?

38:40.882 --> 38:43.817
So, what about you, Max?

38:43.885 --> 38:46.513
What's your abduction story?

39:06.140 --> 39:08.131
<i>I') [ Rock ]</i>

39:12.413 --> 39:15.075
So where'd he get the money
to buy the U.F.O. Center?

39:15.149 --> 39:19.711
- Ah, he helped take an Internet start-up
company public. - Instant millionaire.

39:19.787 --> 39:23.451
<i>But when he started talking about his abduction,
he became a liability.</i>

39:23.524 --> 39:26.391
- They bought him off.
- Yeah, for $300 million.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.394
- Huh!
- Damn!

39:28.462 --> 39:30.829

39:30.898 --> 39:33.230
But what about
the attack on Michael?

39:33.301 --> 39:36.703
Brody said the devicejust went offin his hand.
It sent out a pulse without warning.

39:36.771 --> 39:39.240
Sol think it was because Michael was near,
but I'm not sure.

39:39.307 --> 39:42.709
- But why would it react to Michael and not to you?
- I don't know.

39:47.949 --> 39:49.713
Uh-oh.

39:54.322 --> 39:57.451
So, what've I done now?

39:57.525 --> 40:01.257
You know, my father does consider this
to be a very temporary arrangement.

40:01.329 --> 40:03.491
- You understand that?
- Sure.

40:03.564 --> 40:05.760
All right.
So, in that case...

40:05.833 --> 40:09.599
I just wanted
to tell you that I--

40:09.670 --> 40:12.435
I moved all my crap
outta the room.

40:12.506 --> 40:16.101
You can have it.
I'll sleep on the couch or something.

40:16.177 --> 40:18.475
- You didn't have to.
- It's not a big deal.

40:18.546 --> 40:22.073
Uh, material possessions
only clutter the mind anyway.

40:22.149 --> 40:25.210
You tell 'em, Buddha-boy.

40:26.687 --> 40:29.588
- All right. I'll see ya.
- Hey.

40:29.657 --> 40:31.489
Thanks.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.628
So, Michael,
how do you feel about piercings?

40:41.702 --> 40:44.034
I don't.

40:44.105 --> 40:46.472
You should think about it.

40:46.540 --> 40:48.531
Not into pain.

40:48.609 --> 40:50.703
Well, it only hurts once.

40:50.778 --> 40:53.440
Then it's about
the stimulation.
