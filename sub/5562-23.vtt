WEBVTT

00:11.712 --> 00:13.345
Main body of the fire's
been knocked down.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.363
Give me a secondary search.

00:14.364 --> 00:15.380
Dispatch (over radio):
Yes, captain.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.049
(firefighter coughing)

00:17.051 --> 00:18.350
(chuckles)

00:18.352 --> 00:19.585
Not even 7:00 a.M.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.020
This calls for a celebration.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.355
Maple bacon donuts
from "the nickel," sir?

00:23.357 --> 00:24.356
Make it two dozen.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.591
(laughs)
the fire didn't kill us,

00:25.593 --> 00:27.026
But the donuts might.

00:27.028 --> 00:29.194
Captain, we got a man
missing: Simpson.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.764
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
Man down.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.432
Rookie, with me.

00:39.673 --> 00:40.639
Firefighter:
Captain! In here!

00:40.641 --> 00:43.609
(alarm beeping)

00:43.611 --> 00:45.511
We can hear his pass alarm,
but we can't get inside.

00:45.513 --> 00:46.612
What the hell is this thing?

00:46.614 --> 00:48.814
Get the saw! Now!

00:54.121 --> 00:56.688
(saw revving)

00:57.792 --> 01:00.192
(beeping continues, louder)

01:00.194 --> 01:02.061
Masks on!

01:02.063 --> 01:04.263
(breathing masks hissing)

01:12.673 --> 01:16.542
(beeping continues)

01:18.779 --> 01:20.145
I got him!

01:21.715 --> 01:23.382
Simpson!

01:25.252 --> 01:27.086
¶ ¶

01:45.639 --> 01:48.207
Ow.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.441
Work out wasn't<i> that</i> hard.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.610
What's going on?
You tweak something?

01:51.611 --> 01:53.778
My lymph nodes are swollen,
like really swollen-- feel this.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.281
You feel that?

01:56.283 --> 01:57.516
No.
What are you talking about?

01:57.518 --> 01:59.384
It's like the size
of a frickin' golf ball.

01:59.386 --> 02:00.652
Have you ever
golfed in your life?

02:00.654 --> 02:01.937
Have you seen how big
golf balls are?

02:01.938 --> 02:03.221
All right,
it's the size of a marble then.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.373
But that's still really big.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.523
Okay, big deal,
then maybe you have a cold

02:05.526 --> 02:06.692
Or a sinus infection.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.511
But I have all these
other symptoms, too.

02:08.512 --> 02:10.329
I've got, like,
fatigue and night sweats.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.864
Like, maybe it's
something worse.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.398
Well, the night sweats are
because our house is 90 degrees

02:13.400 --> 02:14.766
And the ac is broken.

02:14.768 --> 02:15.701
Something you were
supposed to get fixed

02:15.703 --> 02:17.369
This morning-- did you?

02:17.371 --> 02:18.871
Do I have bubonic plague?
Okay, no, stop, stop.

02:18.873 --> 02:21.874
Nothing good's
gonna come from googling.

02:22.877 --> 02:23.876
(sighs)

02:23.878 --> 02:25.544
Now, what's going on?

02:25.545 --> 02:27.211
Is-is mercury
in retrograde or something?

02:27.214 --> 02:28.780
No, it's not until next week.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.849
Okay, so why are you going
all howard hughes on me?

02:30.851 --> 02:34.653
Because things are good
between me and you.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.388
Yeah, they're amazing.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.723
And things at work are great,

02:37.725 --> 02:38.757
Like I'm no longer
being investigated

02:38.759 --> 02:40.609
By internal affairs.

02:40.610 --> 02:42.460
Sounds like an improvement.
My mom is fantastic.

02:42.463 --> 02:43.862
Even monty is
healthy for, like,

02:43.864 --> 02:45.731
The first time in forever.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.733
I'm sorry, I'm struggling
to see the problem here.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.568
Because it's too good.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.203
Because things are too good,

02:51.205 --> 02:53.272
And at some point,
the other shoe is gonna drop.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.907
The other... The other shoe?

02:54.909 --> 02:56.308
The lymph node shoe?

02:56.310 --> 02:59.211
The universe-balancing,
reality-checking,

02:59.213 --> 03:00.512
Soul-crushing shoe.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.748
(laughing)

03:02.750 --> 03:03.815
Why are you laughing?

03:03.817 --> 03:05.884
Sorry, that was funny.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.754
"sole-crushing?" that...

03:08.756 --> 03:11.523
That's not a pun. Okay.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.425
You think I'm crazy.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.194
Eh, maybe I'm crazy.
Wait, am I crazy?

03:15.196 --> 03:16.762
Don't, sweetie, I don't think
you're crazy at all.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.198
I don't; I love that you
think everything is fine.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.432
I just, I...

03:20.434 --> 03:21.733
I want you to enjoy it.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.569
If it's good, then take
advantage of that.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.871
Don't worry about it.

03:26.907 --> 03:27.973
Right.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.877
Sorry, that was just
way too tempting.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.945
Granger wants you in ops.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.479
Can you guys, just...
(sighing)

03:34.481 --> 03:35.948
Uh, bring that up with you?
That-that'd be great.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.450
You want us to grab the shoe?

03:37.451 --> 03:38.951
Eric: Yeah because there's a
custom orthotic insole in there.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.886
It's very helpful
to my fallen arches.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.854
It's very expensive.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.590
All the beales have
very flat feet and...

03:44.592 --> 03:46.258
It was a joke.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.326
Uh...

03:50.464 --> 03:51.897
(sighs)

04:00.975 --> 04:02.841
Did you get mugged out there?

04:02.843 --> 04:05.244
I have no idea.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.713
Ooh. I saw this
on the news this morning.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.248
It's a hell of a fire.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.315
Eric:
And unfortunately,

04:10.317 --> 04:11.817
It took its toll.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.519
Lafd station 118 lost a man:

04:14.521 --> 04:16.989
Firefighter terry simpson.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.724
Oh, this is terrible,
but why exactly...

04:18.726 --> 04:20.259
Granger:
Why are we involved?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.793
It's the man who died,
it's where he died.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.862
This is a live feed
from the scene.

04:23.864 --> 04:27.432
Simpson perished inside
that container, except...

04:27.434 --> 04:28.951
It's not a container.

04:28.952 --> 04:30.469
It's a department of
defense-controlled scif.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.803
Deeks:
Really?

04:31.805 --> 04:33.372
Because it doesn't
look it would float,

04:33.374 --> 04:34.907
Especially inside of a building.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.441
Although, what do I know?
I was never in the navy.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.676
Except for old navy.

04:37.678 --> 04:38.910
It's where I buy my boxers.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.280
Not the loose ones,
the tight ones.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.447
You finished?

04:42.449 --> 04:44.016
Yes, yes, he's very
much finished.

04:44.018 --> 04:45.484
It's not a boat, it's a scif.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.985
S-c-I-f. Scif.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.720
Eric:
Sensitive compartmented

04:48.722 --> 04:50.739
Information facility.

04:50.740 --> 04:52.757
It's a secure area used to
process classified intelligence.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.961
Actually, our lovely
ops center qualifies as a scif.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.796
Simpson's body
was found inside.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.666
Firefighters had to use
a rotary saw to get in.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.367
Wait a minute, I thought
you said it was secure.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.702
So how did he get inside?

05:03.704 --> 05:05.003
Yeah, we have no idea.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.072
The surveillance feed was
obscured by all the smoke.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.874
So, do we have
any reason to believe

05:08.876 --> 05:11.543
That this isn't just
a tragic accident?

05:11.545 --> 05:12.944
Well, not yet, but because
of the sensitive nature

05:12.946 --> 05:14.646
Of the information
stored there,

05:14.648 --> 05:15.947
We have to take
every precaution.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.883
Which is why
we tasked an agent

05:17.885 --> 05:19.918
To clear the scene of any
personnel without clearance.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.853
That included fire, ems,

05:21.855 --> 05:23.922
Medical examiners.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.757
Would this agent go by the name
of "nellosaurus,"

05:25.759 --> 05:27.626
Wearing a one-piece jumpsuit?

05:27.628 --> 05:29.461
No one's getting past my girl.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.862
Except for callen and sam.

05:30.864 --> 05:31.997
Except for
callen and sam.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.632
Who are on their way
to determine

05:33.634 --> 05:35.067
If anything was taken
from the scif.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.501
So, you two head
to the boatshed,

05:36.503 --> 05:39.471
Talk to
commander susan yelton of dod.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.473
She and her team
were the only ones

05:41.475 --> 05:43.108
Who should've had
access to the scif.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.509
Kensi and deeks:
On it.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.587
(clears throat)
I'll, um...

05:55.589 --> 05:56.788
Be right back.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.890
I'll be here.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.996
(indistinct radio communication,
overlapping conversations)

06:06.600 --> 06:07.699
Let me see it.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.134
There's nothing to see.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.469
What's the big deal, g?

06:10.471 --> 06:12.104
The fact that you
still call me that

06:12.106 --> 06:13.105
Means it really isn't.

06:13.107 --> 06:14.106
Old habits die hard.

06:14.108 --> 06:15.874
Come on.
No.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.444
There it is.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.513
Thank you.

06:21.515 --> 06:24.816
Grisha aleksandrovich
nikolaev callen.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.152
You happy?

06:27.154 --> 06:30.088
I'm impressed that it
all fit on one card.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.790
Yeah.
(chuckle)

06:31.792 --> 06:33.992
Hold up, it's an old photo.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.728
They didn't even
give you a new photo?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.096
I like that photo.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.998
You look angry in that photo.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.733
Come on.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.835
Probably because you
didn't know your first name.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.512
(sam sighs deeply)

06:53.514 --> 06:55.080
Sam:
This was a hot one.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.082
That fire didn't leave much.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.485
(men shouting commands
in distance)

07:02.689 --> 07:04.156
Check it out.

07:04.158 --> 07:06.158
It's a fire safety mechanism.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.660
It unlocks in the
event of a fire.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.095
Yeah, but it also overrides
the security controls,

07:10.097 --> 07:12.063
Meaning anyone could've
gotten inside this room

07:12.065 --> 07:13.131
With the scif.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.734
Including the
fallen firefighter.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.102
He may have been just...

07:17.104 --> 07:19.070
Checking to see if anyone
was trapped by the fire.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.072
Run a pid sweep
around exposure four,

07:21.074 --> 07:23.074
And tell the salvage
guys to start outside.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.860
They're running
all over our scene.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.645
Special agent callen,
this is special agent hanna.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.013
Are you the arson
investigator?

07:28.015 --> 07:29.581
Peter hackett.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.116
Any idea how much longer

07:31.117 --> 07:32.650
You guys are gonna be
restricting our movement?

07:32.653 --> 07:34.986
Once we secure
all classified material,

07:34.988 --> 07:36.555
You'll have
full run of the place.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.956
Work faster.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.058
Our man died in
your box over there.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.693
His colleagues, his family--

07:41.695 --> 07:43.462
They don't care about
classified information,

07:43.464 --> 07:45.030
They just want to know why.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.832
You have any ideas about that?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.166
Was it arson?
Was it an accident?

07:48.168 --> 07:50.936
You'll have my report
when it's ready.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.805
But at this pace,
like I said,

07:53.807 --> 07:55.240
Work faster.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.477
Hackett:
How's that sweep going, guys?

07:58.479 --> 08:00.045
We don't have all day.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.483
You can't blame him
for being angry.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.688
Eric:
What's up, nell?

08:09.690 --> 08:11.590
Hey, eric.

08:11.591 --> 08:13.491
So I'm taking inventory
of the scif equipment,

08:13.494 --> 08:15.126
Can you double-check it
with the dod?

08:15.128 --> 08:16.127
Sure thing.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.496
Thank you so much.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.931
Hey, boys.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.133
Welcome to the scif.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.235
You released the body?

08:23.237 --> 08:24.520
Negative.

08:24.521 --> 08:25.804
His fellow firefighters
took him out

08:25.806 --> 08:27.239
Before I even arrived
on the scene.

08:27.241 --> 08:28.240
Just like the military.

08:28.242 --> 08:29.674
Leave no man behind.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.109
Get a report from the
medical examiner?

08:31.111 --> 08:32.110
Yes.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.112
Death by asphyxiation.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.948
The theory is the chemical fire
suppression system

08:36.950 --> 08:38.617
Kicked in.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.818
Sucks the oxygen
out of the room.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.253
That is not a good way to go.

08:41.255 --> 08:43.121
All firefighters have
a breathing apparatus.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.690
What happened to simpson's?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.258
Apparently it was
knocked off his face.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.994
The m.E. Also found evidence
of head trauma.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.696
From what?

08:51.698 --> 08:53.598
Well, considering we have
two missing hard drives,

08:53.600 --> 08:54.900
I'm gonna go with...

08:54.902 --> 08:55.901
Someone hit him.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.169
So much for a tragic accident.

08:58.171 --> 09:01.540
What was on the hard drives?

09:01.542 --> 09:03.125
Well, one contained footage

09:03.126 --> 09:04.709
From the scif surveillance
camera, and the other holds

09:04.711 --> 09:06.278
Hundreds of gigabytes
of classified intel.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.948
Everything from terror cells
to drone schematics.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.952
Looks like we don't have to
wait for that report.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.020
Arson, murder, espionage.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.971
Woman: Served three tours
under ronald reagan.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.574
Had a fire drill every
week, but never a fire.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.709
The scif is my first command,

09:37.711 --> 09:39.678
And look what happens.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.112
Commander, the building
that holds the scif,

09:41.114 --> 09:44.215
Also houses a bottling facility
with 30 employees.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.818
Kind of seems like an odd choice
for a super-secret hideout,

09:46.820 --> 09:48.687
So why did you put it there?

09:48.689 --> 09:50.655
I'm guessing the same reason
you're interviewing me

09:50.657 --> 09:51.656
In a boathouse.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.625
Its randomness

09:53.627 --> 09:55.193
Conceals its importance.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.328
You make a fair point,

09:56.330 --> 09:58.663
But somebody still
found out about it.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.832
Deeks: Our team is looking
into the employees

10:00.834 --> 10:02.484
Of the bottling facility,

10:02.485 --> 10:04.135
But there obviously
is another possibility.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.605
I know: Inside job.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.123
But think about it,

10:08.124 --> 10:09.640
If my people wanted
to steal from the scif,

10:09.643 --> 10:11.710
They wouldn't have to
start a fire to get inside.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.678
They already have access.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.747
Unless they wanted it
to look like an outside job.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.682
What exactly do you need

10:17.684 --> 10:19.618
To gain access to the scif?

10:19.620 --> 10:21.653
Two things:

10:21.655 --> 10:23.755
An eight-digit code
to access the outer door...

10:23.757 --> 10:26.324
Which the fire safety
system bypassed.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.926
But to get inside
the scif itself,

10:27.928 --> 10:30.429
You need one of our thumbprints.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.931
All right, well, the fire began
before your work day started,

10:32.933 --> 10:34.766
So have you accounted
for all your people?

10:34.768 --> 10:37.219
And their thumbs?

10:37.220 --> 10:39.671
I only have three people
under my command.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.841
Two have checked in,
with all appendages intact.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.376
And what about the third?

10:44.378 --> 10:47.078
Lieutenant karen roberts.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.947
She's on leave
in sydney, australia.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.416
It's the middle
of the night.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.184
Well, then,
we should wake her up.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.796
(sighs)

11:04.798 --> 11:06.297
What was that?

11:06.299 --> 11:07.298
What was what?

11:07.300 --> 11:08.433
You just breathed.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.035
I try to every day.

11:11.438 --> 11:12.837
Nell.

11:12.839 --> 11:13.938
Yes?

11:13.940 --> 11:15.240
Look.

11:17.711 --> 11:18.810
(sighs)

11:18.812 --> 11:20.679
I knew it.
What?

11:20.681 --> 11:22.814
I just ran the stairs,
I'm a little out of breath.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.784
You have a thing
for firefighters.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.686
Yeah, and...?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.120
I also have a thing
for girl scout cookies

11:29.122 --> 11:32.891
And puppies... Like
99% of the planet.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.994
It is so unfair.

11:35.996 --> 11:36.995
Hold on a second.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.463
Firefighters run

11:38.465 --> 11:39.998
Headlong into burning buildings,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.299
They rescue children,

11:41.301 --> 11:42.333
And lost cats.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.736
It is most definitely fair.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.138
No, I understand
the heroism aspect.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.740
Okay.

11:48.742 --> 11:52.077
I mean, I used to want to be
a firefighter, but...

11:52.079 --> 11:54.746
Okay, by "used to" you mean...?

11:54.748 --> 11:55.980
Five years old.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.365
I had a helmet,

11:57.366 --> 11:58.749
This great little fire truck,
the whole shebang.

11:58.752 --> 11:59.751
Aw.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.620
Yeah.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.488
When I was five,
I wanted to be supergirl, so...

12:03.490 --> 12:05.790
Some dreams just
don't come true.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.859
Yeah, well, that's impossible.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.762
I mean, supergirl's an alien
from the planet krypton.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.363
You can't become an alien.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.832
Right.

12:13.834 --> 12:17.368
B-but... You did become...

12:17.370 --> 12:19.337
A super girl.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.839
Granger:
Let's stop there, beale.

12:20.841 --> 12:21.906
(sighing):
Yeah.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.842
Did you find
anything in the footage?

12:23.844 --> 12:25.176
(clears throat)
uh, no, sorry.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.512
When people hear fire,
they tend to run,

12:27.514 --> 12:29.247
And that's what everyone did.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.850
Nell:
Nothing in the employee
background checks either.

12:31.852 --> 12:35.754
No ties to terrorists
or spy groups.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.355
No suspicious financial
transactions.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.356
No suspects.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.858
(computer blips)

12:39.860 --> 12:41.993
Scratch that.
One suspect.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.895
Lieutenant karen roberts.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.447
She checked in online,

12:45.448 --> 12:46.998
But never boarded her
flight to sydney.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.466
Send kensi and deeks
to her place.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.467
Nell:
Yup.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.436
Uh, excuse me,
assistant director?

12:51.438 --> 12:54.405
Out of curiosity...

12:56.810 --> 13:00.078
...What did you want to be
when you were five years old?

13:01.481 --> 13:03.815
Six years old.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.488
Damage is even worse in here.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.825
Tight, confined space.

13:14.861 --> 13:17.529
Perfect conditions
for a flashover.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.364
Huh.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.966
Uh, can I borrow
your uv light?

13:21.968 --> 13:24.502
Yes, sir.
I'll bring it back.
I'll bring it back.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.545
Callen:
(chuckles) wow.

13:33.547 --> 13:37.115
Either somebody had way too much
fun in here...

13:37.117 --> 13:38.449
Really, g?

13:38.451 --> 13:40.785
You didn't let me finish.

13:40.786 --> 13:43.120
Or three dozen people had just
the right amount of fun in here.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.323
Okay, howard stern,
are you finished?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.458
That's
an accelerant pattern.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.927
Right, but it wasn't poured.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.128
It looks like it was sprayed,

13:50.130 --> 13:51.863
But from where?

13:51.865 --> 13:53.097
A lightbulb.

13:55.902 --> 13:57.969
Do you have an idea, or...

13:57.971 --> 14:00.839
No, it came
from the lightbulb.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.541
You take a needle and you inject
accelerant into the bulb,

14:03.543 --> 14:06.845
You screw the bulb back in, and
then when the light turns on...

14:06.847 --> 14:08.313
Boom.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.115
One of the workers
from the bottling facility

14:11.117 --> 14:13.484
Flips the breakers every morning
at 6:00 a.M.,

14:13.486 --> 14:17.322
And the alarm went off
less than ten minutes later.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.991
I've seen this
tactic before.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.560
Prison gangs use it to
take out their rivals.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.896
Maybe we need to be looking
for someone with a record.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.598
By the way,
we would've found this.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.367
You two got lucky.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.270
But thank you.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.210
So, the thief sets the
conditions for a fire,

14:39.212 --> 14:40.879
Which bypasses the keypad.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.014
Giving him access to
the room with the scif.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.916
Simpson finds him in there,

14:44.918 --> 14:46.117
Thinks maybe he needs help.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.253
Thief knocks him out,

14:48.255 --> 14:50.772
Locks simpson in the scif.

14:50.773 --> 14:53.290
Man, somebody went to a lot of
trouble to steal that drive.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.926
And they could've easily
stolen so much more.

14:54.928 --> 14:55.994
Uh-huh.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.330
This isn't about money.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.965
There's something else
on that drive.

15:00.967 --> 15:03.935
Something very important
to them.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.082
(sighs)

15:27.494 --> 15:31.629
Kensi and deeks checked out
lieutenant roberts' apartment.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.399
She wasn't there, but they
found signs of a struggle.

15:34.401 --> 15:38.136
What's commander yelton's
assessment?

15:38.138 --> 15:40.138
She trusts the lieutenant.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.706
As she should.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.041
She's a good commander.

15:43.043 --> 15:46.311
She assembled a good team.

15:46.313 --> 15:50.982
No one blames you
for the mole, henrietta.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.120
Maybe I blame myself.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.358
Listen, we're
closing in on them.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.128
The mole has been ahead of us

16:04.130 --> 16:08.366
For far too long, owen.

16:08.368 --> 16:11.502
The damage may have
already been done.

16:13.974 --> 16:17.075
You know we shouldn't
be talking in here.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.050
You know, you're right.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.253
We've done enough talking.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.406
(sighs quietly)

16:50.043 --> 16:51.042
Nell: Yeah. Okay.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.042
Any employees from
the bottling facility

16:52.045 --> 16:53.044
Have prison records?

16:53.046 --> 16:54.763
Eric: Uh, no.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.481
Well, two of them did,
but that was decades ago,

16:56.483 --> 16:58.383
And now they have
good jobs, families...

16:58.385 --> 17:01.052
Nothing to indicate they
would steal classified intel.

17:01.054 --> 17:04.122
Right, but we did find a pretty
strong connection to prison.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.657
Yeah.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.191
Eric: The department of
corrections has a program

17:07.193 --> 17:10.028
That trains inmates
to fight wildfires.

17:10.030 --> 17:13.031
For the last three years,
the firefighters of station 118

17:13.033 --> 17:15.166
Have been assigned
to train the inmates.

17:15.168 --> 17:17.235
And 118 just so happens
to be the same company

17:17.237 --> 17:19.103
That put out the fire
this morning.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.305
Eric:
This surveillence video

17:21.307 --> 17:23.608
Is from the western annex
of the bottling facility.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.210
The fire was nowhere near this
location, and yet...

17:34.187 --> 17:35.620
Do we know who this guy is?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.422
Well, firefighters generally
have their names printed

17:37.424 --> 17:39.657
On the bottom of their
turnout jackets,

17:39.659 --> 17:42.093
But this bag is blocking it,

17:42.095 --> 17:44.495
And happens to be the perfect
size for two stolen hard drives.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.130
After this, we lose him.

17:49.102 --> 17:49.968
(sighs quietly)

17:49.969 --> 17:50.835
We don't like
the implication either.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.338
But we can't ignore it.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.406
Simpson's killer may be one
of his fellow firefighters.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.387
Deeks:
I don't like it.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.389
Callen:
No one does.

18:11.390 --> 18:13.390
These guys are brothers
who go into battle together.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.625
It'd be like me murdering sam.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.561
Like, who's gonna buy that?
Not me.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.762
Or me.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.097
Right, 'cause I would
never do that.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.431
It's not that you wouldn't,
you couldn't.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.166
Not even within the
realm of possiblity.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.401
Wait a minute, it's not...

18:23.403 --> 18:25.570
It's not really
what I meant. I...

18:25.572 --> 18:28.372
Even if you tried for decades
to plan my murder,

18:28.374 --> 18:30.174
You still wouldn't
have a chance.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.442
I don't not disagree with that.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.844
Kensi, you've been awful quiet.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.245
What's running through that
pretty little head of yours?

18:34.247 --> 18:36.314
Oh, I agree, you could
never go up against sam.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.782
Love and support,

18:37.783 --> 18:39.249
That's what this relationship
is built on, folks.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.152
I do, however, disagree
that brothers in arms

18:41.154 --> 18:42.620
Could never go up
against each other.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.455
'cause of your dad.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.158
Well, he was killed
by a fellow marine, so...

18:47.160 --> 18:48.159
We don't even know who
we're looking for.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.744
It could be more than one.

18:49.745 --> 18:51.328
Callen: Yeah, we can't risk
tipping them off.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.697
Deeks:
So we go in undercover.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.332
I like it. I volunteer.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.467
You think you can be
a firefighter?

18:56.469 --> 18:57.635
Please, since kensi moved in,

18:57.637 --> 18:59.670
I've put out my fair share
of grease fires.

18:59.672 --> 19:00.772
Thank you for that.

19:00.773 --> 19:01.873
He just thinks he'd
look good in a calendar.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.275
Mr. November, huh?

19:04.277 --> 19:06.244
Unfortunately, deeks,
company 118 overlaps

19:06.246 --> 19:07.845
With your lapd precinct.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.248
We can't risk having
someone recognize you.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.916
At least, now, you're using
evidence to shoot down

19:11.918 --> 19:13.885
My hopes and dream.
Fine, fair enough. Kens?

19:13.887 --> 19:15.753
Well, I think that these guys
are pretty skeptical

19:15.755 --> 19:17.822
About new people,
especially a woman,

19:17.824 --> 19:20.324
And so, uh, as much as
I'd like the challenge,

19:20.326 --> 19:21.526
I think sam and callen would
be more adequate for the job.

19:21.528 --> 19:24.079
Sam?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.631
I did shipside fire drills when
I was a seal, what about you?

19:26.633 --> 19:30.168
Summer of volunteer wildfire
prevention when I was 18.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.737
Then it seems like
you're perfectly ready.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.572
Does it?

19:34.574 --> 19:36.340
All right, there's
ten guys in the company.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.408
We'll back you up.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.676
Let's do it.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.348
(sighs) I mean...

19:47.220 --> 19:47.919
Do you...?

19:49.756 --> 19:52.190
I...
Beale, speak.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.224
What does that even mean?

19:53.226 --> 19:54.943
"six years old."

19:54.944 --> 19:56.661
What kind of five-year-old
dreams of being a six-year-old?

19:56.663 --> 19:58.629
I'm pretty sure it was a joke.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.398
Now granger jokes?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.233
Yes, granger is hilarious.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.335
You just don't get
his dry sense of humor.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.671
Granger's humor is not dry,
it is drought-level.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.905
It is mars.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.774
Newsflash: Mars has water.

20:09.776 --> 20:10.775
Salty water.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.510
More of a brine.

20:12.512 --> 20:16.948
You know what type of five-year-
old dreams of being six?

20:16.950 --> 20:19.884
A five-year-old
who doesn't dream.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.887
I think my soul
just died a little.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.389
Granger's a realist,
he's not a dreamer.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.991
The world needs both.

20:26.993 --> 20:30.628
The grangers and the beales.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.563
Aw.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.299
Granger's from mars, beale
and jones are from krypton.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.601
Hell, yeah.
(chuckles)

20:36.603 --> 20:38.469
(mimics explosion)
yes.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.770
Whoa.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.839
Okay, I just got a
hit on a black van

20:41.841 --> 20:44.308
Near lieutenant
roberts' apartment.

20:44.309 --> 20:46.776
Kaleidoscope picked it up
five times in the last few days.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.480
No plates, tinted windows,
I am officially suspicous.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.716
Yeah, let's see if we can
get a current location.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.920
Man (over p.A.):
It is with regret

20:55.922 --> 20:57.989
That the lafd
announces the death

20:57.991 --> 20:59.991
Of firefighter terry simpson.

20:59.993 --> 21:02.360
Funeral arrangements
to follow.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.031
Hey.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.000
Simpson was proud of you,
rookie, huh?

21:09.002 --> 21:12.036
He might not have
said it, but he was.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.271
I know.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.472
Captain:
Okay, everyone.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.806
Listen up!

21:17.277 --> 21:18.643
Adams.

21:18.645 --> 21:21.379
Get everyone over here.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.049
We got a couple
of forced hires from 206.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.417
Oh, bel air?

21:26.419 --> 21:27.652
Seriously, cap?

21:27.654 --> 21:30.321
They were free, miller.
It was short notice.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.722
Anyway, this is,

21:31.724 --> 21:34.292
Uh... What were
your names again?

21:34.294 --> 21:35.960
What's the point?
We're not gonna learn 'em.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.462
Hanna.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.997
Callen.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.332
Deleted.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.000
(chuckles)
good luck, boys.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.935
Welcome to 118.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.309
I'm sorry for your loss.

21:53.846 --> 21:56.414
House dues are 20 bucks.
Meals are ten.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.350
And we haven't eaten yet,
so you boys can pay right now.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.485
If you'll allow me,
I got lunch covered.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.920
You been here, like,
20 seconds, bel air.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.021
Shut up, lee.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.556
What are you making?

22:05.558 --> 22:07.658
Prime rib-eye steaks.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.961
I like bel air.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.697
I'll show the kitchen, huh?
All right.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.565
Rookie...

22:14.567 --> 22:16.100
It's a mess in here;
clean up.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.104
You're the rookie, huh?

22:20.106 --> 22:23.040
Yeah. Marco guzman.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.343
Marco, I'm the rookie today.

22:25.345 --> 22:28.579
Why don't you help out in the
kitchen, I'll decon the gear.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.648
Thank you, sir.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.453
(indistinct announcement
over p.A.)

22:40.493 --> 22:43.728
Female voice: Please leave
a message at the tone. (beep)

22:43.730 --> 22:45.796
Mama, it's your son.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.848
Again.

22:47.849 --> 22:49.899
I'm starting to get worried
about you; please call me.

22:51.137 --> 22:54.038
(sighs) the shoe's
dropping, I can feel it.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.540
I'm sure everything's
gonna be fine.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.041
I keep trying to figure out
where this feeling
is coming from,

22:57.043 --> 22:58.743
And I'm pretty sure it's her.
Something is wrong.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.411
Should I have eric
ping her cell?

23:00.413 --> 23:02.079
No, you shouldn't have
eric ping her cell.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.448
Kensi, I've called her
four times.
In the last ten minutes.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.484
She could be in the shower.
Yeah, but she also

23:06.486 --> 23:07.852
Could've slipped
in that shower.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.487
Okay, do you want
something bad to happen?

23:09.489 --> 23:11.122
Of course I don't want
something bad to happen.

23:11.124 --> 23:13.691
Okay.
I'm just saying that
I can feel it, it's coming.

23:13.693 --> 23:14.792
(sighs)

23:14.794 --> 23:16.527
Okay.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.162
No more sex for you.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.964
What?!

23:19.966 --> 23:21.031
Oh, you heard me.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.033
You've been cut off.

23:23.034 --> 23:25.034
Stop. Okay, I see
what you're trying to do.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.704
But it doesn't work like that.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.439
You can't force
the shoe to drop.

23:28.441 --> 23:29.874
(whispers):
Oh, we'll see.

23:29.876 --> 23:33.911
Also, you couldn't make it
two days, three days, tops.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.646
What?!
I'm irresistible.

23:35.648 --> 23:36.747
I'm a manimal.

23:36.749 --> 23:37.948
I could resist you.

23:37.950 --> 23:38.949
(phone rings)
(chuckles)

23:38.951 --> 23:39.950
Mama?

23:39.952 --> 23:42.086
Uh, no.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.121
Oh. Nell.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.189
All right.
That's awkward.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.141
What's up?

23:47.142 --> 23:49.092
So, I managed to track
a suspicious van

23:49.095 --> 23:51.095
From lieutenant roberts'
apartment

23:51.097 --> 23:53.464
To an abandoned building
in the 1200 block

23:53.466 --> 23:54.799
Of aliso boulevard.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.634
All right, we're not far.
We're on our way.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.637
Uh, will you have eric
ping my mom's ce...
No!

23:59.639 --> 24:02.006
See? You already
can't keep your paws off me.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.441
Oh, my gosh.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.209
Irresistible.
Shut up.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.878
Deeks:
<i> No one cuts off the manimal.</i>

24:09.182 --> 24:10.948
Here you go, cap.
Thanks.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.552
Appreciate your help.
Mm-hmm.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.620
I remember
on my first day

24:16.622 --> 24:19.824
I walked to the door and simpson
put a cookbook in my hand

24:19.826 --> 24:22.460
And he said,
"you learn it front to back."

24:22.462 --> 24:23.894
Hmm.

24:25.498 --> 24:28.632
Yeah. My rookie year, I got
more burns in the kitchen

24:28.634 --> 24:30.468
Than I did on calls.

24:30.470 --> 24:31.535
(quiet laugh)

24:32.705 --> 24:35.239
Were you and simpson close?

24:37.243 --> 24:39.777
He taught me a lot.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.079
I'm sorry.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.552
Medium rare, brother?

24:50.790 --> 24:52.723
Vegetarian.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.931
What's his deal?

25:00.933 --> 25:03.534
He's just angry.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.169
Always has been.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.037
He was in afghanistan
before this.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.607
Helmand province.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.877
Sounds rough.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.245
He has nightmares.

25:14.247 --> 25:16.113
Wakes us all up.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.649
I think he lost
a lot of guys over there.

25:30.530 --> 25:31.729
So, we gonna talk about it,

25:31.731 --> 25:34.532
Or are we all just gonna
sit here in silence?

25:35.968 --> 25:39.236
The investigators are
doing their job, lee.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.105
We'll talk about it once
we know what happened.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.239
Once we know?

25:42.241 --> 25:43.941
Cap, we know what happened.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.142
Simpson died alone.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.544
Where were we?

25:46.546 --> 25:48.012
Why didn't anybody
have eyes on the man?

25:48.014 --> 25:49.747
It was a big building, lee.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.148
And there's the first excuse.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.083
And I'd expect that
coming from you, miller,

25:53.085 --> 25:54.251
Because you
went in with him

25:54.253 --> 25:56.320
But you didn't come
back out with him.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.289
Lee... Cool it.

25:58.291 --> 25:59.857
What are you saying?

25:59.859 --> 26:01.559
I'm saying...
Captain:
Lee...

26:06.766 --> 26:10.301
We'll see what
the investigators have to say.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.572
Watch your six, hanna.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.309
It's every man for himself.

26:33.359 --> 26:37.094
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.A.)

26:37.096 --> 26:38.963
...Lines down,
possible brush fire.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.643
What, no steak?

26:52.645 --> 26:54.345
Oh, I had one.
It was delicious.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.114
You find anything?

26:57.116 --> 27:00.784
It's more like
what I didn't find.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.654
Our mystery firefighter
from the video--

27:06.125 --> 27:07.425
Take a look.

27:07.426 --> 27:08.726
You notice anything
different about the jacket?

27:09.762 --> 27:11.762
Sam:
The jacket in the video says

27:11.764 --> 27:13.297
"los angeles city."
mm-hmm.

27:13.299 --> 27:16.300
Every jacket in
here says "lafd."

27:16.302 --> 27:18.836
Eric looked into it--
lafd changed it

27:18.838 --> 27:21.672
A few years ago and
issued new jackets.

27:21.674 --> 27:24.408
So our mystery man
was wearing outdated gear.
Mm-hmm.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.645
Retired firefighter?

27:27.647 --> 27:29.647
Or somebody impersonating
a firefighter.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.048
Nell (over radio):
Callen? Sam?

27:31.050 --> 27:32.049
Go ahead, nell.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.884
Kensi and deeks just arrived

27:33.885 --> 27:35.718
At the abandoned building
we tracked the van to,

27:35.721 --> 27:37.421
And you're not
gonna believe this--

27:37.423 --> 27:40.124
(sighs)
it's on fire.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.393
I just called it in to dispatch.

27:42.395 --> 27:43.794
(tone sounding)
dispatch (over p.A.):
Light force 118,

27:43.796 --> 27:45.729
Task force 119, ra 118.

27:45.731 --> 27:48.799
Structure fire,
1256 west aliso boulevard.

27:48.801 --> 27:52.703
(overlapping chatter)

27:52.705 --> 27:55.239
I'm guessing I don't have
time to run upstairs.

27:55.241 --> 27:58.175
What's upstairs?

27:58.177 --> 28:00.978
Man: Double time!
Man 2: Let's go! Let's go!

28:00.980 --> 28:02.312
Oh, come on.

28:02.314 --> 28:03.447
You know you
want to do it.

28:03.449 --> 28:04.915
Let's roll out!

28:04.917 --> 28:06.050
You ready?

28:06.052 --> 28:08.752
(firefighters shouting)

28:14.894 --> 28:16.093
Man: Clear!
Man 2: Clear!

28:16.095 --> 28:17.161
(sirens wailing)

28:34.380 --> 28:36.363
Where are they?

28:36.364 --> 28:38.347
Almost on scene.
Kensi and deeks are
holding in place.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.084
They searched the van--
it's empty.

28:40.086 --> 28:42.152
Granger:
This should be interesting.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.255
(siren wailing,
horn blaring)

28:48.394 --> 28:49.426
(horn blares)

28:49.428 --> 28:52.496
(siren wails, horn blares)

28:54.366 --> 28:55.766
(sirens stop)

28:59.171 --> 29:00.437
Deeks:
Got to be honest.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.439
I'm really jealous
right now.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.241
I'm sorry, all day,
you've been convinced

29:04.243 --> 29:05.509
Something bad's
gonna happen,

29:05.511 --> 29:07.244
And now you want to run
into a burning building?

29:07.246 --> 29:10.848
What can I say? I'm a man
of complex contradictions.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.316
(sighs):
Call me crazy...

29:12.318 --> 29:14.518
But I'd be
right there beside you.

29:17.056 --> 29:20.090
Battalion chief and 119
will be here in a few.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.825
Lee, hanna, forcible entry.

29:21.827 --> 29:24.828
Miller, take callen.
Top vent.

29:24.830 --> 29:27.331
Rookie, stick with me.
Let's see what you got.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.932
Watch your back.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.834
You, too.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.903
(firefighters
shouting commands)

29:41.514 --> 29:43.547
One, two, three.

29:43.549 --> 29:44.915
(grunts)

29:45.851 --> 29:47.184
(coughs)

29:47.186 --> 29:50.254
¶ ¶

29:51.223 --> 29:53.290
(inhales, air hisses)

29:54.860 --> 29:56.894
Firefighter:
Lafd! Anybody here?

30:10.509 --> 30:12.576
Hey!

30:13.546 --> 30:16.046
You didn't turn your bottle on.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.915
You'll be eating smoke in there.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.017
(valve squeaks, air hisses)

30:20.019 --> 30:21.585
Thanks.

30:26.859 --> 30:29.426
(firefighters shouting)

30:29.428 --> 30:31.128
Primary search.
You two go left,

30:31.130 --> 30:32.396
Me and the rookie go right.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.398
Stay with me.

30:34.399 --> 30:36.399
Firefighter: Battalion,
we're on the second floor.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.001
Starting primary search.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.971
Lafd! Is anyone here?

30:49.949 --> 30:53.317
Lee: Damn it, rookie!
Captain told you to go right!

30:53.319 --> 30:54.918
What the hell
are you doing here?

30:54.920 --> 30:57.321
(breathing through mask)

30:57.323 --> 30:59.389
Lee, lee, wait. Lee, wait!

31:01.627 --> 31:04.595
Mayday! Mayday!
Captain, lee's been stabbed!

31:04.597 --> 31:07.164
Hanna!
I'm going after the guy!

31:07.166 --> 31:08.131
Hanna, wait!

31:10.369 --> 31:11.902
Sam: Kensi, deeks,

31:11.904 --> 31:13.103
He's heading for the exit.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.204
Deeks:
Copy that, sam.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.946
(glass shattering)

31:22.948 --> 31:24.615
(firefighters
shouting in distance)

31:30.556 --> 31:32.956
(grunting)

31:42.301 --> 31:44.001
(coughing)

31:49.375 --> 31:50.941
What the hell?

31:50.943 --> 31:53.176
Miller, give me a hand!

31:55.214 --> 31:57.014
Miller, knock down that fire.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.054
It's okay.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.322
We're gonna get you out of here.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.596
It's okay.
Stay with me, lieutenant.

32:12.598 --> 32:15.065
Let's go. Come on.

32:15.067 --> 32:17.334
(grunting)

32:25.010 --> 32:27.044
Deeks: I got him.
Kensi: Stay down!

32:29.181 --> 32:30.180
Get up.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.015
(grunting)

32:32.017 --> 32:33.317
All right. Move.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.054
(coughing)

32:38.490 --> 32:40.557
Miller, take her.

32:47.099 --> 32:48.498
Thanks for your
help in there.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.467
Next time, bring me a steak.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.302
(chuckles)

32:57.376 --> 32:59.376
Your imposter is brent williams.

32:59.378 --> 33:02.045
He's a rejected
firefighter cadet from 2010,

33:02.047 --> 33:03.580
Which is why he had
the old jacket.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.683
Anything to indicate why
he'd steal classified intel?

33:06.685 --> 33:08.085
He had a bunch of odd jobs

33:08.087 --> 33:10.187
But nothing
that would indicate treason.

33:10.189 --> 33:13.290
We didn't recover
the stolen drives from the fire.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.525
Williams may not have been
working alone.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.094
Eric: We'll keep looking.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.996
Any word on lee and roberts?

33:18.998 --> 33:21.198
Uh, roberts is suffering
from smoke inhalation,

33:21.200 --> 33:22.566
But she'll recover.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.101
And lee is still in surgery.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.569
All right. Thanks, eric.

33:25.571 --> 33:26.737
Yeah.

33:26.739 --> 33:28.071
So he's not talking.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.539
Any progress out here?

33:29.541 --> 33:32.776
I think so, but I'm not
sure I understand it.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.778
Based on these pages recovered
from the fire,

33:34.780 --> 33:37.047
It looks like
williams decrypted tide.

33:37.049 --> 33:38.548
I'm sorry, what's tide?

33:38.550 --> 33:41.718
Terrorist identities
datamart environment.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.253
It's like the no fly list.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.721
Yelton: But much bigger.
It holds

33:44.723 --> 33:48.392
Over 20,000 names of known
and suspected terrorists.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.093
Why would he want this?

33:50.095 --> 33:52.029
Eric:
Guys, you need to see this.

33:52.031 --> 33:53.563
Dod just sent me
this internet video.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.766
Streaming live now.

33:55.768 --> 33:58.802
I am doing this
because I'm tired

33:58.804 --> 34:00.637
Of seeing good americans

34:00.639 --> 34:03.407
Being killed by people
that's peter hackett,
the arson investigator.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.575
Like this man.
He's one of thousands

34:05.577 --> 34:08.512
On a secret government list
of terrorists.

34:08.514 --> 34:12.049
The feds know about him,
but they're not doing anything.

34:12.051 --> 34:14.051
My demands are simple:

34:14.053 --> 34:16.086
If the government
does not start rounding up

34:16.088 --> 34:20.090
The people on this list,
I will put the list online,

34:20.092 --> 34:23.060
And we, the american people,
will take

34:23.062 --> 34:25.195
Matters into our own hands.

34:25.197 --> 34:28.432
Starting with this man.

34:28.434 --> 34:32.169
You have one hour to start
arresting these terrorists.

34:32.171 --> 34:35.338
So when you said this list had
names of suspected terrorists,

34:35.340 --> 34:36.606
Does that mean that...

34:36.608 --> 34:39.076
People can be added
for all sorts of reasons--

34:39.078 --> 34:40.677
Making frequent calls
to trouble spots,

34:40.679 --> 34:42.579
Giving to the
wrong charities,

34:42.581 --> 34:44.781
Even having
a similar name

34:44.783 --> 34:45.983
To another suspect.

34:45.984 --> 34:47.184
Many of the people on that list
are innocent.

35:03.569 --> 35:06.103
Now, before he was
an arson investigator,

35:06.105 --> 35:07.637
Peter hackett worked
as a fire marshal.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.640
And he did the inspection of the
bottling facility 15 months ago.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.142
That's how he knew
about the scif.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.227
I don't care how he knew.

35:13.228 --> 35:14.311
I just want to know
how to stop him.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.745
Where's this feed
coming from?

35:15.747 --> 35:17.547
Eric:
He's using an onion router.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.683
It could be coming from
anywhere. We did retroactively

35:19.685 --> 35:21.818
Track his movements after
he left the scene of the fire

35:21.820 --> 35:24.654
This morning but... Lost him.

35:24.656 --> 35:25.755
Callen and sam
are now on their way

35:25.757 --> 35:27.290
To hackett's house
in baldwin hills,

35:27.292 --> 35:29.226
But it's doubtful
he's even there.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.827
How many people
on the tide list?

35:30.829 --> 35:32.395
Over 21,000.

35:32.397 --> 35:34.397
(sighs)

35:34.399 --> 35:37.134
Okay, maybe there's another way.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.636
Put me through to the boatshed.

35:39.638 --> 35:40.637
Yeah.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.671
(keypad beeps)

35:45.677 --> 35:49.346
Peter hackett is holding
this man, jamal narang.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.548
Look at him:
He's got a wife,

35:51.550 --> 35:53.250
He's got two kids,

35:53.252 --> 35:55.235
And the only thing
he's guilty of

35:55.236 --> 35:57.219
Is sharing a name
with a bomb maker in pakistan.

35:57.222 --> 35:58.889
Deeks: But you don't care,
do you? 'cause he's

35:58.891 --> 36:01.491
Just collateral damage,
just like terry simpson,

36:01.493 --> 36:03.160
Darren lee, lieutenant roberts.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.828
Let me ask you a question.
This is important.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.231
How many dead innocent people
can you live with?

36:08.233 --> 36:10.400
The people on that list
aren't innocent.

36:10.402 --> 36:11.868
They're terrorists.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.471
Somebody's got
to protect us from them.

36:14.473 --> 36:16.540
From people like your brother,
for example?

36:16.542 --> 36:18.241
What?

36:18.243 --> 36:19.509
Yeah.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.911
See, this is just one page
from the tide list.

36:20.913 --> 36:22.445
You know,
the one that you killed for.

36:22.447 --> 36:23.580
But, um...

36:23.582 --> 36:25.582
Why don't you tell me
if you recognize

36:25.584 --> 36:27.517
One of those names.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.688
What is he...
What is he doing on this?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.640
Well, it turns out

36:33.641 --> 36:35.591
Your brother ronald has been
donating money to a charity

36:35.594 --> 36:37.594
With questionable ties
to terror.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.729
Deeks: So if your friend peter
hackett releases that list in,

36:39.731 --> 36:41.731
Oh, 32 minutes,

36:41.733 --> 36:43.733
Then it looks like
your brother ronald

36:43.735 --> 36:46.603
Is gonna be
collateral damage, too.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.405
Where's hackett?

36:51.977 --> 36:54.311
Eric: Callen, sam--
hackett is broadcasting

36:54.313 --> 36:56.313
From an old bar on alameda.

36:58.383 --> 37:01.484
Eric: It was shuttered last year
for fire safety violations.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.304
Sam:
It's all boarded up.

37:04.305 --> 37:05.988
If we break down that door and
we don't have a line of sight...

37:05.991 --> 37:09.526
Hackett will release the list
and kill the hostage.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.962
We got to find a way
to draw him out.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.733
Or smoke him out.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.537
(muffled grunting, gasping)

37:21.473 --> 37:22.672
Hackett:
Would you shut up?

37:22.674 --> 37:24.774
It's almost over.

37:24.776 --> 37:28.345
(countdown blipping steadily)

37:28.347 --> 37:31.514
Nothing on the news.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.416
Guess your new country doesn't
care about you after all.

37:33.418 --> 37:36.653
(muffled grunting, gasping)

37:36.655 --> 37:37.754
What the hell...?

37:43.795 --> 37:46.429
Are you kidding me?

37:48.000 --> 37:49.499
Sam:
Federal agents!

37:54.806 --> 37:56.539
(hackett yells, grunts)

37:58.343 --> 37:59.943
(grunts)

37:59.945 --> 38:03.580
(countdown continues blipping)

38:04.850 --> 38:06.716
(groans)

38:06.718 --> 38:08.551
We'll save you
the investigation.

38:08.553 --> 38:11.421
That... Was definitely arson.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.061
Okay, great.
Thank you.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.462
Thank you.

38:20.432 --> 38:21.531
Lee's out of surgery.

38:21.533 --> 38:22.899
He's gonna make a full recovery.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.701
He's tough.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.036
They all are.

38:26.038 --> 38:27.704
I feel good.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.406
<i> I</i> feel good!

38:29.408 --> 38:31.041
Today was a great day.

38:31.043 --> 38:33.510
I feel like iron man
at the end of the day.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.845
(chuckles) we should save people
from burning buildings

38:35.847 --> 38:37.781
A little more often.
(chuckles)

38:37.783 --> 38:39.582
Not bad for a couple
of rookie firemen.

38:39.584 --> 38:41.718
That's what I'm talking about.
Let me ask you

38:41.720 --> 38:43.720
A question:
Did you guys actually put out

38:43.722 --> 38:46.589
Any fires today,
or did you just start 'em?

38:46.591 --> 38:48.058
A little bit of both.

38:48.060 --> 38:50.026
G needs a new photo for his I.D.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.761
I don't. I really don't.

38:51.763 --> 38:52.762
Good night, granger.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.564
Good night.

38:54.566 --> 38:55.799
Thanks for killing the vibe.

38:55.801 --> 38:58.735
(callen chuckles)

38:58.737 --> 39:00.737
Admit it, you're
a changed man.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.872
I'm the same man
with a new name.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.874
No, no, no, I still think
you look angry in that photo.

39:04.876 --> 39:07.344
I wasn't angry-- I was hungry.
Which is exactly how I feel now.

39:07.346 --> 39:09.012
And you know
what would taste really good?

39:09.014 --> 39:11.748
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know. One steak comin' up.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.117
Thank you.
All right? Greedy.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.422
There he is.

39:20.759 --> 39:21.758
I was looking for you.

39:21.759 --> 39:22.758
I thought
we were gonna grab dinner.

39:22.761 --> 39:23.860
(sighs) we are.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.695
At my mom's.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.530
She called you back?
She's okay?

39:27.532 --> 39:29.866
No, she's definitely
not... Okay.

39:29.868 --> 39:33.603
Because the other shoe
has officially dropped.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.138
Are you kidding me?
What happened?

39:36.875 --> 39:38.675
(sighs)

39:38.677 --> 39:39.909
"I'm sorry I wasn't answering.

39:39.911 --> 39:43.046
I was at the spa all day
with my... Boyfriend"?

39:43.048 --> 39:44.581
Firing.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.983
Yo! Whoa!
A little warning.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.718
Yeah, yeah, she
could've warned me

39:48.720 --> 39:50.453
Instead of just springing
it on me like this.
No, I mean...

39:50.455 --> 39:51.855
You know, and now she
wants us to meet him,

39:51.857 --> 39:54.057
And he's-he's
cooking us dinner?

39:54.059 --> 39:55.792
"come by tonight.
He's a fantastic cook

39:55.794 --> 39:58.661
And is making his specialty,
pasta aglio e olio."

39:58.663 --> 40:00.997
I love pasta aglio e olio.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.532
So does everybody else,
including me.

40:02.534 --> 40:03.666
And she knows that.

40:03.668 --> 40:05.402
(chuckles)

40:05.403 --> 40:07.137
Aw, sweetie, this isn't
the other shoe dropping.

40:07.139 --> 40:10.840
This is... Your mom looking
for some company.

40:10.842 --> 40:14.010
Yeah, but we all know she
has terrible taste in men.

40:14.012 --> 40:16.413
(sighs)

40:16.415 --> 40:18.815
Deeks, just because your dad
was an awful human being

40:18.817 --> 40:20.884
And forced you
to shoot him doesn't mean

40:20.886 --> 40:22.886
That everybody your mom...

40:22.888 --> 40:25.422
Oh, no. You're not...

40:25.424 --> 40:27.023
Here for target practice
for her boyfriend,

40:27.025 --> 40:28.892
Are you?
What?!

40:28.894 --> 40:30.894
No.

40:30.896 --> 40:34.030
No... I'm just... I was
just blowing off some steam.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.433
(inhales)

40:36.435 --> 40:39.035
(sighs)
come here.

40:39.037 --> 40:41.771
I think
this is a good thing.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.440
I really do.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.842
And if it turns out
not to be, then, uh,

40:45.844 --> 40:47.577
I'll be right there with you

40:47.579 --> 40:49.979
And we'll take this jerk down
together.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.481
You promise?

40:51.483 --> 40:52.482
Absolutely.

40:52.484 --> 40:53.550
Off the top rope?

40:53.552 --> 40:54.684
(chuckling):
Off the top rope.

40:54.686 --> 40:56.085
Forearm shiver?

40:56.087 --> 40:58.621
You okay with that?
Yeah.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.891
Now I want to go, because
I want to eat aglio e olio.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.893
<i>Andiamo. Aglio e olio!</i>

41:03.895 --> 41:07.030
Uh-huh. I'm pretty sure you
just like saying that out loud.

41:07.032 --> 41:08.698
Aglio e olio
e olio!
You can stop.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.967
Aglio e olio...
That can stop.

41:18.577 --> 41:21.578
That was
a clever strategy, owen--

41:21.580 --> 41:25.114
Faking williams' brother
on the tide list.

41:26.051 --> 41:29.586
Well, it was fake then.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.988
It's not fake now.

41:35.193 --> 41:37.994
Are you still worried,
henrietta,

41:37.996 --> 41:40.997
About our earlier conversation?

41:40.999 --> 41:44.934
It's just a feeling, owen.

41:52.677 --> 41:55.845
What kind of feeling?

41:55.847 --> 41:58.915
A feeling of disquiet.

41:58.917 --> 42:01.518
(inhales)

42:01.520 --> 42:05.054
That something is coming.

42:06.157 --> 42:07.223
Something neither of us
has anticipated.
