WEBVTT

00:05.480 --> 00:06.830
Hey there, stranger.

00:06.830 --> 00:08.590
I missed you.

00:11.580 --> 00:13.500
Looks like you may have missed a spot.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.150
You're naked.

00:15.830 --> 00:16.910
What are you doing?

00:17.330 --> 00:18.970
Where are your clothes?

00:18.970 --> 00:22.960
Well, first step in showering
is usually taking them off,

00:22.960 --> 00:23.950
Now where was i?

00:23.950 --> 00:26.990
You know, I can't do this
without my coffee.

00:26.990 --> 00:28.730
- Okay, why are you covering your eyes?
- I am not.

00:28.730 --> 00:30.880
Are you joking?

00:31.220 --> 00:33.780
- You are not joking.
- I just... I gotta...

00:33.780 --> 00:35.870
Okay what are you doing?

00:36.310 --> 00:37.900
I've barely seen you this week.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.290
You work late every night.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.610
Okay, we don't even have to talk
about our engagement party.

00:41.610 --> 00:42.440
Engagement party?

00:42.440 --> 00:43.440
Yeah, with everything going on at work,

00:43.440 --> 00:45.680
You'd think you could help me
out for five minutes.

00:45.680 --> 00:49.060
Jeez, Scott, I-I don't know
what's gotten into you lately.

00:54.370 --> 00:55.770
You were her fiance?

00:55.770 --> 00:57.670
Kind of a "quantum leaper",

00:57.670 --> 00:58.650
did you hear what i said?

00:58.650 --> 01:00.180
We were naked.

01:00.180 --> 01:02.540
I-I had to look away so I didn't, uh...

01:02.540 --> 01:05.150
Well, I may have glanced. I am human.

01:05.150 --> 01:07.280
But what does it mean?

01:07.280 --> 01:10.720
In greek mythology, gods often
disguise themselves as mortals

01:10.720 --> 01:13.920
so they could spy on their subjects
and test their loyalties.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.030
Well, not that I mind
being compared to Zeus,

01:16.030 --> 01:19.200
but I don't need to spy on Maggie
to know her loyalties.

01:19.200 --> 01:23.510
Zeus played these games with women
for whom he had special affection.

01:23.510 --> 01:26.010
Don't start. Whatever happened
last year with me and Maggie,

01:26.010 --> 01:27.320
which was nothing, by the way,

01:27.320 --> 01:29.830
is over, done with and forgotten, okay?

01:29.830 --> 01:32.810
Any affection I have for her
is purely professional.

01:32.810 --> 01:35.230
Well, maybe it has something
to do with a case.

01:35.230 --> 01:37.420
If you haven't noticed,
these visions usually do.

01:37.420 --> 01:38.790
It has to do with her.

01:38.790 --> 01:40.540
This is two Maggie visions in a row.

01:40.540 --> 01:43.540
Last week she's at the supreme court with
-- with Posner & Klein,

01:43.540 --> 01:46.020
and this week she's in the shower with me.

01:46.020 --> 01:48.720
Maybe Posner made her an offer at his firm.

01:48.720 --> 01:53.650
Well,if God is sending you visions about
whether or not Maggie is changing firms,

01:53.650 --> 01:57.620
which, you know, given his busy schedule
and seemingly more pressing priorities,

01:57.620 --> 02:02.200
I highly doubt, one thing we've learned is
your visions of the future can be altered.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.550
You can change destiny.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.620
Don't let her go.

02:09.759 --> 02:14.250
It's a common misunderstanding that a
public interest firm can't be profitable,

02:14.250 --> 02:17.290
but I assure you we will succeed.

02:17.290 --> 02:18.220
And the benefits?

02:18.220 --> 02:22.920
The firm's tahoe ski retreat will be made
available to successful attorneys.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.390
Clients you care passionately about.

02:25.390 --> 02:29.390
Blue-chip clients operating at the
fore frontof global commerce.

02:29.390 --> 02:33.750
Our mission will be to use the law as
the highest form of social activism.

02:33.750 --> 02:37.120
A different guest chef will be
flown in every monday.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.780
What you give up in
simple dollars and cents

02:39.780 --> 02:43.170
you will more than make up
in quality of life.

02:43.910 --> 02:47.080
this is going to be the single
least suspenseful meeting of my day.

02:47.080 --> 02:50.430
Actually, I haven't made up my mind yet, sir.

02:52.430 --> 02:53.780
Really?

02:53.780 --> 03:00.010
Because Marci and I would like you to
consider joining our firm as a full partner.

03:00.940 --> 03:03.870
Can you believe how easily people are bought?

03:03.870 --> 03:06.110
The exodus has begun.

03:06.110 --> 03:09.090
Only the morally bankranted weak-minded.

03:09.090 --> 03:10.810
No one liked your wife's banana bread.

03:10.810 --> 03:13.060
We only ate it to be polite!

03:13.740 --> 03:15.930
How are the assistants
and the junior staff holding up?

03:15.930 --> 03:18.210
None of my roosters are
gonna fly this coop.

03:18.210 --> 03:20.120
You're the best, Patti.

03:20.120 --> 03:24.030
I assume that will be reflected
in my christmas bonus?

03:26.820 --> 03:27.710
Hey.

03:27.710 --> 03:29.380
Good to see you...

03:29.380 --> 03:30.550
Clothed...

03:30.550 --> 03:31.970
Nicely.

03:32.660 --> 03:33.940
how are you?

03:33.940 --> 03:35.040
Horrible.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.900
Look, I know the firm's split
has left some people

03:36.900 --> 03:40.580
with some very stressful decisions.

03:40.580 --> 03:41.460
You're telling me.

03:41.460 --> 03:42.760
So Posner did make you an offer.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.410
He didn't even ask for a meeting.

03:44.410 --> 03:45.120
Oh, that's great.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.170
Great?

03:46.170 --> 03:49.880
He's met with every single
other associate here.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.410
My engagement party's friday, Eli.

03:52.410 --> 03:54.440
The timing of all this couldn't be worse.

03:54.440 --> 03:58.930
Literally half my guest list called
in the last few hours to cancel.

03:58.930 --> 04:03.420
Guess they feel awkward about doing the
macarena with soon-to-be ex-coworkers.

04:03.420 --> 04:05.030
I don't know which terrifies me more--

04:05.030 --> 04:08.620
the fact that we'll be doing
the macarena at your party or

04:08.620 --> 04:10.500
that your guests are all people
who work here.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.300
Well, let's face it.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.150
I work 80 hours a week.

04:13.150 --> 04:16.910
My life is Scott and you...

04:17.560 --> 04:18.980
this firm.

04:18.980 --> 04:22.520
Well, this place is--well,
was--my family.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.680
And we still will be, only smaller.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.870
You can't leave, Maggie.

04:27.870 --> 04:29.990
Why would you ever think I would?

04:29.990 --> 04:32.300
Posner is like Darth Sidious.

04:32.300 --> 04:35.040
Well, then beware the dark side.

04:39.130 --> 04:40.610
Miss Dekker?

04:40.610 --> 04:43.070
Mr.Posner would like to see you.

04:43.070 --> 04:44.350
Thanks.

04:44.350 --> 04:47.330
What makes you think that I could
convince Matt not to leave

04:47.330 --> 04:48.790
or that I would want to?

04:48.790 --> 04:50.550
He just needs a gentle push.

04:50.550 --> 04:53.200
Well, he's your boyfriend, Taylor.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.850
Did you try the red nightie thing?

04:54.850 --> 04:57.350
That certainly convinced me to,uh...

04:57.350 --> 04:59.220
that's inappropriate. Noted.

04:59.220 --> 05:01.260
Just put him on a case with you, you know?

05:01.260 --> 05:03.620
Show him all the great things
about public interest law,

05:03.620 --> 05:05.670
how amazing it feels to really help people.

05:05.670 --> 05:07.260
Show him some of that Stone magic.

05:07.260 --> 05:08.250
This is Matt Dowd.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.270
You don't even believe in the Stone magic.

05:10.270 --> 05:12.080
Please, Eli?

05:12.080 --> 05:13.140
I need this.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.080
He's gonna see right through me.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.290
You need me?

05:17.290 --> 05:19.650
You need me?

05:19.650 --> 05:21.270
For what?

05:21.270 --> 05:22.860
My analytical mind?

05:22.860 --> 05:24.790
My innate command of civil procedure?

05:24.790 --> 05:26.660
- Oh, my deft-
- You have an edge.

05:26.660 --> 05:32.490
Some may call it obnoxious, but that
adversarial edge in court can sometimes--

05:32.490 --> 05:34.000
Oh, shut up, Stone.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.830
I know Taylor put you up to this.

05:35.830 --> 05:37.080
You can't let her know I told you.

05:37.080 --> 05:37.750
You didn't.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.470
You're as transparentas windowpane.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.610
They've offered me partner.

05:42.610 --> 05:43.820
I've made up my mind.

05:43.820 --> 05:46.170
I just don't know how to tell her.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.860
Is there a good way to tell your girlfriend

05:47.860 --> 05:50.200
that you're gonna work for the people
who poleaxed her father?

05:50.200 --> 05:51.610
Probably not, no.

05:51.610 --> 05:54.220
So don't say yes yet.

05:54.220 --> 05:57.040
You owe her to at least pretend
to mull it over.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.460
Besides, you know, you make Posner & Klein
sweat over this for a week,

06:00.460 --> 06:02.710
they'll probably raise your offer.

06:02.710 --> 06:05.460
Well, I do want a corner office.

06:05.460 --> 06:07.950
Me--senior associate?

06:07.950 --> 06:10.830
In charge of your pro bono department?

06:10.830 --> 06:12.710
At double your current salary.

06:12.710 --> 06:14.510
Come on.

06:14.510 --> 06:18.220
I never kid about money or about
four weekspaid vacation--time

06:18.220 --> 06:21.100
to do some of your special projects--

06:21.100 --> 06:22.840
mother Teresa's next junket.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.550
I think mother Teresa's dead, sir.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.500
Well, then someone else alive and well
and whining about the rain forest.

06:27.500 --> 06:32.230
But I thought you and Ms. Klein
don't even like pro bono work.

06:32.230 --> 06:35.610
don't let my disdain over all things
tie-dyedfool you, Ms.Dekker.

06:35.610 --> 06:40.650
Even I understand that making money
and doing good are not mutually exclusive.

06:40.650 --> 06:46.210
It's good P.R., And there's also this.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.640
$20,000 to the eco preservation league?

06:50.640 --> 06:54.300
A gesture of good will to show you
how serious I am about this.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.170
Just consider it an early engagement gift.

06:57.170 --> 07:00.750
All I ask is you take a few days.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.760
Just think about it.

07:03.760 --> 07:06.820
Eli Stone
Season 02 Episode 04

07:06.820 --> 07:08.900
VO: -=www.ydy.com/bbs=-

07:08.900 --> 07:11.070
Corrections: Elaï Team

07:11.070 --> 07:13.210
Patti, you know that box
you've been keeping for me

07:13.210 --> 07:16.090
with all the faxes and letters
from potential clients?

07:16.090 --> 07:18.440
You mean the wackadoo file?

07:18.920 --> 07:22.440
I mean the box with all the fascinating,
complex legal dilemmas

07:22.440 --> 07:25.070
that could one day end up
in the supreme court.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.500
Well, what I have is a box full of cases
from the nut balls that saw you on the news--

07:28.500 --> 07:31.450
- the wackadoo file.
- Could I just have it?

07:31.450 --> 07:36.110
Here's one, and I have three more
in the supply closet.

07:36.110 --> 07:37.370
Now...

07:38.060 --> 07:40.040
some of these cases are quite significant.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.900
It's all about finding
the diamond in the rough.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.320
Snooze.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.080
The environment makes you want to nap.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.380
I got it.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.280
Well, here's a first amendment issue.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.980
Man wants to sue his landlord for
clearing out mold which looks like Jesus.

07:53.980 --> 07:55.570
Jesus mold...

07:55.570 --> 07:56.460
Pass.

07:56.460 --> 08:00.020
Oh, we may have something here--
twin sister flight attendants.

08:00.020 --> 08:01.800
See, now this sounds promising.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.790
They want to sue the airline
that fired them when they turned 60.

08:07.620 --> 08:08.970
Patti!

08:08.970 --> 08:10.630
Can we get another box in here?

08:10.630 --> 08:14.840
You sure you wouldn't rather
see a living client?

08:14.840 --> 08:17.760
This is how my cases usually come in.

08:18.970 --> 08:20.460
Mr. Stone?

08:20.460 --> 08:21.850
Hey, I'm Will Sonneborn.

08:21.850 --> 08:24.430
Um, this is my associate, Matt Dowd.

08:24.430 --> 08:25.400
What can we do for you?

08:25.400 --> 08:26.780
I need you to help my girlfriend.

08:26.780 --> 08:31.320
Homeland security arrested her
and her husband yesterday.

08:31.320 --> 08:34.000
I realize these are confusing times.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.830
Posner's probably making
some of you offers--

08:36.830 --> 08:38.370
substantial offers.

08:38.370 --> 08:40.840
But as the assistant
who's been here the longest,

08:40.840 --> 08:45.700
I want to remind you that Jordan and Eli
care for each and every one of you.

08:45.700 --> 08:49.650
Then why is it the first thing they did
was freeze next year's wage increases?

08:49.650 --> 08:51.800
That's a lot to deal within this econom

08:51.800 --> 08:54.310
Jordan's vision for this firm is real.

08:54.310 --> 08:57.520
He and Eli want to change things
to make a difference.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.350
No offense, Patti, but
Eli's a little eccentric.

09:01.350 --> 09:02.990
Eli may be...

09:02.990 --> 09:06.600
unorthodox, but I've seen what
he can do, and believe me

09:06.600 --> 09:10.600
when I tell you it's meaningful,
it's inspirational.

09:10.600 --> 09:15.340
This new firm will be a place that
we can be proud to come to every day.

09:15.340 --> 09:17.800
How often does that happen?

09:17.800 --> 09:20.510
Get them to lift the wage freeze
and we'll think about it.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.120
Yeah.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.390
Great.

09:23.390 --> 09:26.810
I'll talk to Eli, work something out
for all of us.

09:26.810 --> 09:28.300
Could you explain that again?

09:28.300 --> 09:29.720
Will is my boyfriend.

09:29.720 --> 09:33.090
He gives her sex, but I give her
emotional support

09:33.090 --> 09:35.330
and someone to watch "Project Runway" with.

09:35.330 --> 09:37.000
Carter, can you please be serious?

09:37.000 --> 09:37.930
He's kidding.

09:37.930 --> 09:39.070
So who is he to you?

09:39.070 --> 09:42.720
Carter is my best friend, also my--
gay green card husband.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.270
Oh, that clears it right up.

09:44.270 --> 09:46.890
Sana and Carter were in the same
public health program at Berkeley.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.430
And we've been B.F.F. Sever since.

09:48.430 --> 09:49.890
How did I.C.E. Get involved?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.410
When my student visa ran out.

09:51.410 --> 09:53.190
I was supposed to return to Pakistan,

09:53.190 --> 09:56.350
but Will and I were just getting
to really know one another.

09:56.350 --> 09:57.460
We were falling in love.

09:57.460 --> 09:58.820
I couldn't just leave.

09:58.820 --> 10:01.590
I had nturally found happiness.

10:01.590 --> 10:04.820
I tried to extend my student visa,
get a work visa.

10:04.820 --> 10:06.000
Nothing worked.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.660
I married her so she could stay here
and fall in love.

10:09.660 --> 10:10.920
Why didn't you just marry Will?

10:10.920 --> 10:12.550
I would have.

10:12.550 --> 10:13.580
I wanted to.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.510
It was too early in our relationship.

10:15.510 --> 10:17.730
I didn't feel comfortable asking him
to do that.

10:17.730 --> 10:20.890
How did homeland security realize
that the marriage was a fraud?

10:20.890 --> 10:25.370
I had an ugly breakup with this jackass
who knew the whole story.

10:25.820 --> 10:27.850
My removal hearing is this week.

10:27.850 --> 10:31.500
After which you face up
to five years in prison.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.490
You have to help them.

10:32.490 --> 10:33.460
There's nothing we can do.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.370
You committed fraud,
and in post-9/11 america,

10:35.370 --> 10:39.460
that means you're going to prison,
and you're going back to Pakistan.

10:39.460 --> 10:40.510
That can't happen.

10:40.510 --> 10:42.110
There's something else.

10:42.110 --> 10:44.240
Tell 'em, Sana.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.040
Uh, she was supposed to return
home to an arranged marriage.

10:51.040 --> 10:55.460
But I couldn't go through with it,
not after I met Will...

10:55.460 --> 10:57.610
not after I knew real love.

10:57.610 --> 11:01.700
If she goes back to Pakistan,
her family will kill her.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.300
Let's get a move on, Macaroni.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.010
Those caterers are not gonna wait
around forever,

11:05.010 --> 11:06.660
and we alreadyrescheduled twice.

11:06.660 --> 11:08.450
I'm coming.

11:08.830 --> 11:09.500
Hey!

11:09.500 --> 11:11.160
Lookin' forward to
the festivities tomorrow.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.120
I'm glad you guys can be there.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.580
There's a lot to celebrate.

11:13.580 --> 11:14.890
Besides your engagement, you mean?

11:14.890 --> 11:16.870
Well, Maggie got a very interesting
offer today.

11:16.870 --> 11:18.510
Scott.

11:18.510 --> 11:21.400
Hey, could I have a word with you
for a second in private?

11:21.400 --> 11:22.900
Yeah.

11:23.880 --> 11:24.660
What's he talking about?

11:24.660 --> 11:25.730
Did Posner make you an offer?

11:25.730 --> 11:28.130
Well, he...he gave me a really hard sell.

11:28.130 --> 11:29.330
So you told him no.

11:29.330 --> 11:31.640
I-I didn't want to be rude.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.150
I told him I'd...

11:33.150 --> 11:34.710
I'd think about it for a few days.

11:34.710 --> 11:36.100
What did he offer?

11:36.100 --> 11:39.060
Senior associate in charge of
their pro bono department

11:39.060 --> 11:41.840
with lots of support for
the environment and stuff.

11:41.840 --> 11:42.900
How much is he gonna pay?

11:42.900 --> 11:44.150
- Twice my current salary.
- We'll match it.

11:44.150 --> 11:45.100
How can you?

11:45.100 --> 11:48.470
I'm now a partner at this firm,
and it's what you deserve.

11:48.470 --> 11:50.670
Trust me, I'm gonna take care
of this Maggie.

11:50.670 --> 11:56.770
No wonder Martin Posner was always s
o prickly handling W.P.K.'s finances.

11:56.770 --> 11:58.620
It was a huge task when we had revenue.

11:58.620 --> 12:02.470
Maybe we should consider putting
the building on the market, downsizing.

12:02.470 --> 12:03.840
What kind of statement would that make?

12:03.840 --> 12:07.340
- Dad--
- Sweetie, please stop taking
the stress on yourself.

12:07.340 --> 12:08.530
I'm fine.

12:08.530 --> 12:10.700
I'm just not sleeping...

12:10.700 --> 12:11.580
or hungry.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.460
There's just a lot of life changes
ahead, you know?

12:13.460 --> 12:17.330
Yes, I have a feeling I do know.

12:18.460 --> 12:22.610
Honey, if there's ever anything
you'd like to talk to me about...

12:25.220 --> 12:27.520
Maggie Dekker just received an offer
from Posner & Klein-

12:27.520 --> 12:28.670
-a substantial one.

12:28.670 --> 12:30.710
We have to match it.

12:30.710 --> 12:32.040
Eli, we can't afford to.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.190
And besides, Maggie's the last person
who's gonna go work for them.

12:34.190 --> 12:36.250
That's not true. She'll leave. I know it.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.720
Eli, I understand you have a special
affection for Ms. Dekker.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.130
Why does everybody keep saying that?

12:40.130 --> 12:40.940
You're kidding, right?

12:40.940 --> 12:42.960
She's a friend, a platonic one.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.970
She believed in me before anyone else did.

12:44.970 --> 12:49.270
I realize that, but we haven't matched
Posner's salary offer for any other associate.

12:49.270 --> 12:51.710
- Well, if we wantto keep them--
- You're a partner now, Eli.

12:51.710 --> 12:52.930
You've got to start thinking like one,

12:52.930 --> 12:56.320
which means not allowing sentiment
to cloud your judgment.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.700
It means worrying about how we
fund our quarterly contributions

12:59.700 --> 13:01.560
to the associates' health insurance plan,

13:01.560 --> 13:07.350
how we keep our offices lit and warm
this winter amidst
skyrocketing electric bills.

13:07.350 --> 13:12.490
But if you truly think Maggie's presence
at our firm justifies treating her differently

13:12.490 --> 13:17.510
than all the other associates and
placing our obligations to them at greater risk,

13:17.510 --> 13:19.670
it's your call.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.820
I thought you were taking
the day off to,uh,

13:26.820 --> 13:28.250
prepare for your engagement party.

13:28.250 --> 13:31.660
Oh,just stopped by to pick up a few
things before the parents arrive.

13:32.290 --> 13:37.030
Look, I spoke to Jordan, and the thing is,

13:37.030 --> 13:40.100
we're losing nearly all our
revenue-streaming clients.

13:40.100 --> 13:44.260
And I tried to figure out a way as best
I could to match Posner's offer --

13:44.260 --> 13:47.360
Eli, it doesn't matter.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.030
It doesn't?

13:48.030 --> 13:51.260
This firm changed my life.

13:51.260 --> 13:57.110
And you--well, the firm--made me see for
the first time I could make a true difference.

13:57.110 --> 13:58.800
I could never leave.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.780
I can't tell you how happy
I am to hear that.

14:00.780 --> 14:02.600
Stone, we're late for court.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.780
Listen, Dekker, uh,
this, uh, party of yours--

14:04.780 --> 14:09.210
is that more like a gift thing,
or is a wedding present enough?

14:10.470 --> 14:12.440
It's a different world over there.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.060
In Pakistan, I am considered
my father's property.

14:16.060 --> 14:19.330
His honor is defined by my purity.

14:19.330 --> 14:24.010
By entering into a sexual relationship
with a man other than the one chosen for you...

14:24.010 --> 14:27.060
I became kari-- an impure woman.

14:27.060 --> 14:29.490
And what is the punishment
for becoming kari?

14:29.490 --> 14:35.270
The only way for my father to restore
his honoris to kill the one who damaged it--

14:35.270 --> 14:40.780
me--preferably publicly, so all can
witness his honor being restored.

14:40.780 --> 14:44.630
Objection--what happens to certain
women in Pakistan is horrible,

14:44.630 --> 14:46.260
of course, but it's not at issue here.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.490
Uh, it is when you're trying
to send her back to Pakistan.

14:48.490 --> 14:49.540
I agree.

14:49.540 --> 14:50.730
Objection overruled.

14:50.730 --> 14:56.090
Miss Booker seemed to imply just now
that honor killings are rare in Pakistan.

14:56.090 --> 14:58.770
Hundreds of girls are murdered each year.

14:58.770 --> 15:02.500
My friend was burned because
she kissed the wrong boy.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.960
Her body lay in the street
for two hours.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.170
No one did anything.

15:07.170 --> 15:08.470
Thank you, Sana.

15:08.470 --> 15:10.190
Nothing further.

15:10.630 --> 15:15.480
I guess you're unaware that honor
killings in Pakistan have been o
utlawed for three years now.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.760
One law cannot change ancient customs.

15:18.760 --> 15:22.440
And even if it could,
the law must still be enforced.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.720
But all the prosecutors are men.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.170
All the judges are men.

15:26.170 --> 15:31.000
Not every pakistani girl who disobeys
her fatheris murdered, am I correct?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.770
There are lucky ones.

15:32.770 --> 15:36.130
But some fathers are more
controlling, like my father.

15:36.130 --> 15:38.780
Your father allowed you
to come here and study.

15:38.780 --> 15:41.560
That doesn't sound
particularly controlling.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.400
Has he ever laid a hand against you?

15:43.400 --> 15:44.700
- No.
- Threatened you?

15:44.700 --> 15:47.520
But yet you think he would kill you
if you return to your country.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.650
Do you have any proof?

15:48.650 --> 15:50.240
No, I...I don't.

15:50.240 --> 15:55.950
So we are to just take your word--
the word of a woman who stood in front of another judge

15:55.950 --> 16:00.250
and promised to love, honor and cherish
till death do you part a gay man?

16:00.250 --> 16:01.660
Objection.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.070
Nothing further.

16:08.220 --> 16:09.980
You realize this could all be bull, right?

16:09.980 --> 16:11.940
Like "become a U.S.Citizen for dummies"--

16:11.940 --> 16:15.020
when marrying your gay best friend fails,
cry honor killing.

16:15.020 --> 16:16.360
Gee, Matt, cynical much?

16:16.360 --> 16:20.200
I'm just saying clients lie,
even your clients.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.490
Good news.

16:21.490 --> 16:24.490
11 legal secretaries,
6 paralegals and five clerks--

16:24.490 --> 16:26.450
they all signed to stay on with us.

16:26.450 --> 16:27.470
That's nearly everyone.

16:27.470 --> 16:31.690
Now all you have to do is convince
Jordan to unfreeze their raises for the next year.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.300
It's amazing that you convinced them,

16:33.300 --> 16:37.060
but as of now there are ten and
a hal factual lawyers staying.

16:37.060 --> 16:40.750
So how can I justify keeping
22 staff with or without raises?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.630
Can you justify letting them go?

16:42.630 --> 16:44.070
The firm is splitting in two.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.720
Which is what I might do
to you in a few seconds.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.160
I put my ass on the line.

16:48.160 --> 16:51.280
If you don't come up with that money,
we're gonna lose every assistant, every paralegal--

16:51.280 --> 16:53.060
people who believe in this place will stay.

16:53.060 --> 16:54.940
This is the real world.
People have obligations.

16:54.940 --> 16:57.080
I realize that, but my hands are tied.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.220
Your hands are tied?

16:59.220 --> 17:01.390
listen to yourself.

17:01.390 --> 17:02.800
You sound like posner.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.210
Is that the kind of boss you wanna be?

17:04.210 --> 17:06.270
If so, maybe they all should leave.

17:06.270 --> 17:07.150
Patti, come on. I'm trying.

17:07.150 --> 17:08.200
Don't "come on" me!

17:08.200 --> 17:11.760
I am going to take
a ridiculously long lunch.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.690
You can answer your own damn phones.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.089
Goodness gracious.

17:16.089 --> 17:17.800
What my cousin did is unforgivable.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.390
I should not even be here.

17:19.390 --> 17:20.750
Then why are you?

17:20.750 --> 17:25.020
Sana told us that you two were v
ery close when she first arrived here,

17:25.020 --> 17:28.010
and then one day you just
stopped returning her calls.

17:28.010 --> 17:28.980
Why?

17:28.980 --> 17:30.950
I love Sana, okay?

17:30.950 --> 17:33.070
But I could not watch her
become a western woman.

17:33.070 --> 17:34.170
You're wearing J.Crew and nike.

17:34.170 --> 17:37.820
Doesn't seem like you have much
problem with westernization.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.370
My family expected me
to look out for her.

17:40.370 --> 17:42.520
And you got tired of being a spy.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.690
Look, this is the way
it's been for centuries.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.010
Sana's father was disgraced.

17:46.010 --> 17:50.170
Do you have any idea how painful it is
for a man to lose his honor?

17:53.270 --> 17:58.030
Well, maybe there's a way that, uh,
you could help without anyone knowing.

17:58.030 --> 18:04.980
Maybe there's a letter or an e-mail
from Sana's father intimating his plan to harm her.

18:04.980 --> 18:08.420
You're asking me to sacrifice my honor.

18:08.730 --> 18:13.220
Look,I understand that some people
are very strict about their customs,

18:13.220 --> 18:19.490
but you've lived here long enough
to see things a different way.

18:19.490 --> 18:21.300
Can you tell me that you still believe that

18:21.300 --> 18:24.800
because a woman looks at a man
the wrong way or refuses to marry someone

18:24.800 --> 18:29.740
chosen by her father that
she should be killed?

18:29.740 --> 18:33.580
You honestly believe that
because your cousin is a woman

18:33.580 --> 18:38.270
that she shouldn't be allowed to decide
for herself who she loves or marries?

18:38.270 --> 18:42.640
She's living her own life
in this country just like you.

18:43.110 --> 18:46.940
Should she have to die because of that?

18:46.940 --> 18:50.860
And can you just stand by and watch?

18:51.980 --> 18:54.420
So what about your...

18:54.420 --> 18:56.720
honor?

18:58.910 --> 19:00.470
Okay, I'll admit it.

19:00.470 --> 19:02.280
I didn't think you'd turn him.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.980
How's it feel working on a case
you're actually invested in?

19:04.980 --> 19:06.140
Don't get ahead of yourself.

19:06.140 --> 19:09.390
I've still very invested in keeping up
my membership at pebble beach.

19:09.390 --> 19:11.650
Admit it, Dowd. You're hooked.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.630
Oh, come on.

19:17.630 --> 19:19.610
Again?

19:22.780 --> 19:23.910
Scott?

19:23.910 --> 19:25.800
What is it with these two
and the shower?

19:25.800 --> 19:28.450
Are you coming in here?
I'm all lathered up.

19:28.450 --> 19:31.210
No,I'm just gonna guh...

19:31.210 --> 19:37.450
to the bedroom and--and--and get
dressed with the door closed and locked, Mag...

19:37.450 --> 19:40.310
nificent woman who is not Maggie.

19:40.310 --> 19:41.570
Come on.

19:41.570 --> 19:44.270
We don't have that much time
before you're a married man.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.770
We need to take advantage.

19:45.770 --> 19:48.360
We know each other...

19:48.360 --> 19:49.660
intimately?

19:49.660 --> 19:50.850
Oh, God.

19:50.850 --> 19:52.500
You're freaking out again.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.970
Are you gonna end things again?

19:53.970 --> 19:54.770
Shocker.

19:54.770 --> 19:56.640
What is that, the fourth time this month?

19:56.640 --> 19:58.490
Sorry, no time today.

19:58.490 --> 20:01.950
Get your butt in here.
I have to meet my husband at 6:00.

20:04.630 --> 20:05.700
It is in there.

20:05.700 --> 20:09.780
Sana's father asking Amir to join 
his cousins in defending his honor.

20:09.780 --> 20:11.120
And we all know what that means.

20:11.120 --> 20:14.560
It's vague at best, earsay,
and there's no way to authenticate

20:14.560 --> 20:16.740
that this letter actually came
from Sana's father.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.280
It's a death sentence,
and you know it.

20:18.280 --> 20:21.210
Your client broke the law,
and despite this letter,

20:21.210 --> 20:23.110
I am obligated to have her removed.

20:23.110 --> 20:26.030
Were you born without the compassion 
gene or something?

20:26.030 --> 20:28.610
Homeland security doesn't pay 
me for my compassion.

20:28.610 --> 20:31.090
Then we'll take the letter
to judge Kettleman.

20:31.090 --> 20:33.340
I think he'll be inclined
to save her life.

20:33.340 --> 20:36.040
See,I think he'll be
inclined to enforce the law,

20:36.040 --> 20:37.230
him being a judge and all.

20:37.230 --> 20:42.750
Which is why he will not send a
young woman to her own lynching.

20:46.960 --> 20:50.800
I am willing to cut your client a deal.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.580
But it is the only deal
I'll put on the table.

20:53.580 --> 20:54.700
It's insidious.

20:54.700 --> 20:57.300
We're obligated to present it,
but the offer sucks.

20:57.300 --> 21:01.600
If I go back to Pakistan, they'll
have all charges against Carter dropped?

21:01.600 --> 21:03.050
I'm just as guilty as she is.

21:03.050 --> 21:03.970
You're an american.

21:03.970 --> 21:05.430
Booker's a bureaucratic hack.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.190
If Sana accepts, she can tell her boss
she sent another one back.

21:08.190 --> 21:10.320
It's another victory for national security.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.830
Well, don't worry. She won't accept.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.570
What will booker do if I don't?

21:13.570 --> 21:14.440
That doesn't matter.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.870
They'll press forward with their
cases against you and Carter.

21:16.870 --> 21:19.620
But, Sana, we can win this.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.530
You cannot take this offer.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.750
I've already gotten you
in so much trouble.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.860
I can't live with the chance
you'll go to jail.

21:25.860 --> 21:28.130
Oh, yes, you can.

21:28.130 --> 21:30.790
I didn't spend the last two years
explaining to every single date

21:30.790 --> 21:34.840
I brought home why there were bras
hanging in the bathroom so you could bail.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.710
I love you.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.960
I did this to save your life.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.240
And now I want to save yours.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.420
You can't go back there.

21:41.420 --> 21:44.150
I see no other choice.

21:44.150 --> 21:46.980
I'm taking the deal.

21:56.930 --> 21:58.460
Poor Maggie.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.910
No one is here.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.110
Matt?

22:04.110 --> 22:05.740
Sorry.

22:05.740 --> 22:08.150
You're barely even here tonight.

22:08.150 --> 22:10.260
Is it the case?

22:10.260 --> 22:13.480
I just can't stop thinking,
wishing there was some way

22:13.480 --> 22:17.410
I could stop Sana from taking this deal.

22:17.860 --> 22:20.290
I've never seen you get
this upset over work before.

22:20.290 --> 22:23.240
Not sure I've been this upset before.

22:23.590 --> 22:25.280
I'm sorry.

22:25.690 --> 22:29.410
It is nice to see you caring
so much about a client, though.

22:30.890 --> 22:31.940
What?

22:31.940 --> 22:35.120
Subtleness isn't exactly your forte.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.770
Think I don't know you had
Stone set me up?

22:37.770 --> 22:39.130
You could have just passed
me a note asking

22:39.130 --> 22:41.970
if I was staying
with boxes for yes or no

22:41.970 --> 22:44.700
and "I" dotted with a little heart.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.410
Okay.

22:47.390 --> 22:48.470
It was immature.

22:48.470 --> 22:50.910
I just--I didn't want to pressure you.

22:50.910 --> 22:54.800
Couples have survived working
at different firms before.

22:55.310 --> 22:57.660
I just...

22:57.660 --> 23:01.750
there's only so much stress
a relationship can take.

23:01.750 --> 23:03.900
No pressure there.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.260
You're right.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.680
I'm not gonna ask you to stay.

23:06.680 --> 23:07.630
Good.

23:07.630 --> 23:11.780
'Cause, Taylor, you mean so much to me.

23:11.780 --> 23:15.970
If you had asked me, there's
no way I could have said...

23:16.510 --> 23:18.340
no.

23:18.340 --> 23:20.800
Why are you smiling?

23:20.800 --> 23:25.420
I think I just figured out a way
to get Sana to change her mind.

23:25.420 --> 23:29.510
The other thing about mojitos is
they make you feel all better,

23:29.510 --> 23:32.560
like a tropical beach party
in your mouth.

23:34.310 --> 23:36.320
I mean, look at me.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.170
I'm having a great time.

23:38.170 --> 23:39.390
Are you sure?

23:39.390 --> 23:42.340
'Cause you're sitting
over here all on your own.

23:42.340 --> 23:43.710
It's a disaster.

23:43.710 --> 23:45.140
It's just bad timing.

23:45.140 --> 23:46.160
Don't take it personally.

23:46.160 --> 23:49.420
Eli, it's my engagement party.

23:49.420 --> 23:50.760
It should be...

23:50.760 --> 23:53.880
should feel different.

23:54.190 --> 23:57.910
Like all these people who didn't
show up knew what I didn't.

23:57.910 --> 24:01.260
Scott and I had a huge blowup
this morning.

24:01.520 --> 24:05.130
He doesn't understand
why I turned down Posner.

24:05.130 --> 24:06.640
Poor guy.

24:06.640 --> 24:12.140
He's so worried and concerned
about our future.

24:12.140 --> 24:14.280
He's so good to me.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.600
And I...

24:17.460 --> 24:20.820
I can never hurt him.

24:22.660 --> 24:25.450
Maggie, I have to talk
to you about something.

24:25.450 --> 24:27.430
Thought you might be hungry.
Brought you a plate--

24:27.430 --> 24:28.610
sushi.

24:28.610 --> 24:29.480
Oh, no, thanks.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.010
A lovely brie.

24:31.010 --> 24:31.920
I'm okay.

24:31.920 --> 24:32.930
Champagne?

24:32.930 --> 24:33.760
No.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.260
How about this emmentaler?

24:43.170 --> 24:44.420
Have you tasted this?

24:44.420 --> 24:46.690
Come on.

24:46.690 --> 24:48.650
You're pregnant.

24:48.650 --> 24:50.040
I knew it.

24:50.040 --> 24:53.240
Your mother had a thing for emmentaler
when she was pregnant, too.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.970
Okay, columbo, you got me.

24:54.970 --> 24:56.740
Please don't say anything to anyone.

24:56.740 --> 24:57.770
Matt doesn't even know.

24:57.770 --> 24:58.680
Of course not.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.090
That's complicated.

25:00.090 --> 25:02.080
I understand.

25:02.490 --> 25:04.460
You could have told me, though.

25:04.740 --> 25:05.430
I'm sorry.

25:05.430 --> 25:07.550
How are you feeling?

25:09.270 --> 25:11.820
Pretty overwhelmed, to be honest.

25:11.820 --> 25:15.130
It's a lot to think about--a baby.

25:15.380 --> 25:18.790
I never really saw myself as a mother.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.990
I'm not sure I do now.

25:21.990 --> 25:23.950
I see.

25:24.710 --> 25:26.990
So you might not be keeping it?

25:26.990 --> 25:29.620
I'm sorry if that's not
what you want to hear, dad.

25:29.620 --> 25:31.170
I mean, things with Matt and I are good,

25:31.170 --> 25:35.010
but we're not exactly serious.

25:35.570 --> 25:37.060
Can I raise a baby on my own?

25:37.060 --> 25:38.900
I mean, would I even want to?

25:38.900 --> 25:44.000
Sweetie, the decisionis yours,
of course.

25:44.000 --> 25:50.080
But just so you know,
you are never alone.

25:51.060 --> 25:52.490
Thanks, dad.

25:53.450 --> 25:54.330
Well, I don't understand.

25:54.330 --> 25:55.920
Y-you were in my bathroom?

25:55.920 --> 25:59.340
Well, yeah. 
I was in your shower first.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.310
Uh, it's--it's, uh, very nice.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.880
It's a great selection of shampoo.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.900
It's a little girly for my taste, but, uh--

26:04.900 --> 26:07.940
But what were you doing in there?

26:07.940 --> 26:10.870
You see, the things is, um...

26:10.870 --> 26:12.120
I wasn't...

26:12.120 --> 26:16.600
me, and,um, I wasn't...

26:16.600 --> 26:18.410
one.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.630
What are you talking about?

26:19.630 --> 26:21.270
- Maggie, I was--
- Scott!

26:21.270 --> 26:23.370
There you are.

26:23.370 --> 26:24.620
Hi, honey.

26:24.620 --> 26:28.060
Should've figured when I couldn't find
her anywhere, she'd be here with you.

26:28.060 --> 26:30.110
Maggie, your parents are looking
all over for you.

26:30.110 --> 26:31.590
Parents.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.400
I better go.

26:38.420 --> 26:40.030
I'm only gonna say this once.

26:40.030 --> 26:41.270
Back off.

26:41.270 --> 26:43.200
Look, we're getting married.
Why can't you respect that?

26:43.200 --> 26:44.690
Why can't you?

26:44.690 --> 26:45.930
What's that supposed to mean?

26:45.930 --> 26:52.210
It means I saw you with a certain,uh,
naked married woman.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.890
Why don't you mind your own business, bro?

26:53.890 --> 26:56.550
Why don't you tell her, bro, before I do?

26:56.550 --> 27:01.140
Before she makes the biggest mistake
of her life and marries a piece of crap like--uhh!

27:06.200 --> 27:07.220
Eli!

27:07.220 --> 27:09.350
What--what's going on?

27:09.730 --> 27:10.600
Just...

27:10.600 --> 27:11.350
go tell her.

27:11.350 --> 27:13.920
You tell her, or I will.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.260
Go clean up your face.

27:23.260 --> 27:26.000
We'll talk later.

27:29.250 --> 27:31.690
And you...

27:31.990 --> 27:33.470
please leave.

27:33.470 --> 27:35.730
Now!

27:52.640 --> 27:54.460
What are you doing here so early?

27:54.460 --> 27:55.820
Is it Carter? Will?

27:55.820 --> 27:57.640
No, no, it's nothing like that.

27:57.640 --> 28:01.530
Look, you can't take this deal.

28:01.530 --> 28:03.410
Carter doesn't need your sacrifice.

28:03.410 --> 28:04.220
He needs you.

28:04.220 --> 28:05.920
Going to jail would destroy him.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.750
Living with the guilt of you
dying would destroy him...

28:09.750 --> 28:11.490
not to mention Will.

28:11.490 --> 28:12.970
Will's a strong man.

28:12.970 --> 28:15.200
He'll be fine.

28:15.790 --> 28:18.060
Tell him that.

28:20.790 --> 28:23.870
All right, step in, please.

28:25.410 --> 28:29.590
Sana, tell Will exactly how he'll
be fine living the rest of his life

28:29.590 --> 28:33.790
not knowing whether the woman
he loves is alive or dead.

28:33.790 --> 28:37.430
And, Will, you tell Sana
exactly how you and Carter

28:37.430 --> 28:39.890
will be able to go on without her,

28:39.890 --> 28:45.120
that a day will come when you two
won't wake up thinking about her,

28:45.120 --> 28:49.620
wondering, hating yourselves.

28:49.980 --> 28:53.610
If you two can actually convince
each other of those things,

28:53.610 --> 28:56.360
then, Sana, you should take this deal.

28:56.360 --> 29:00.720
But my guess is you won't.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.640
My guess is you'll stay.

29:03.640 --> 29:07.360
You'll stay for the men who love you.

29:10.460 --> 29:14.270
Sana made some mistakes,
but the question before you, your honor,

29:14.270 --> 29:18.830
is whether those mistakes justify
putting her to death.

29:18.830 --> 29:21.570
That's what sending her to Pakistan will do.

29:21.570 --> 29:25.430
The letter from Sana's father
to her cousin proves that.

29:25.430 --> 29:30.400
Ms. Booker calls the marriage
between Sana and Carter fraudulent,

29:30.400 --> 29:36.750
yet Sana was willing to return
to Pakistan and face death for Carter.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.380
That...

29:40.330 --> 29:48.150
that is sacrifice and
a love more real than

29:48.150 --> 29:53.110
what's between most married couples I know.

30:00.350 --> 30:03.160
I'll save you all the suspense.

30:03.160 --> 30:06.590
Miss Khan has not demonstrated
respect for our laws.

30:06.590 --> 30:10.940
She knowingly entered into a fraudulent marriage
in order to obtain a green card.

30:10.940 --> 30:13.510
I cannot reward nor condone this behavior,

30:13.510 --> 30:17.380
and I cannot extend to her
the privilege of U.S.Citizenship.

30:17.380 --> 30:22.470
I am convinced, however, that Ms. Khan
would be in grave danger if she returns to Pakistan.

30:22.470 --> 30:24.750
I therefore grant the withholding
of her removal.

30:24.750 --> 30:29.740
She'll be allowed to remain here
as long as there is a threat against her.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.520
Sorry things didn't work out.

30:40.520 --> 30:43.290
We'll see how smug you are tomorrow.

30:43.290 --> 30:44.660
What do you mean by that?

30:44.660 --> 30:45.920
You pushed me too far.

30:45.920 --> 30:51.000
I spoke to my supervisor, Candace Bonneville,
told her about our little green card situation.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.450
Recommended that she expedite proceedings
to get Carter the maximum--five years.

30:55.450 --> 30:56.130
What? No.

30:56.130 --> 30:57.400
Why would you do that?

30:57.400 --> 31:00.340
Why would you think I wouldn't?

31:03.100 --> 31:07.280
I'm so sorry for my behavior...

31:07.280 --> 31:09.130
for everything.

31:09.710 --> 31:12.380
You shouldn't have had to
find out about Scott that way.

31:12.380 --> 31:14.170
Are things, uh...

31:14.170 --> 31:15.780
how--how are things?

31:15.780 --> 31:17.810
The engagement's off.

31:17.810 --> 31:19.410
The wedding's off.

31:19.410 --> 31:20.690
It's all...

31:20.690 --> 31:22.490
off.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.960
It's for the best.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.970
If there's anything that I can do...

31:29.280 --> 31:31.910
if you want me to punch him again, I will.

31:31.910 --> 31:35.010
I'm a giver that way.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.730
He's not entirely to blame, you know.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.630
He had good reason.

31:43.630 --> 31:45.740
Scott's no dummy.

31:46.110 --> 31:48.110
He knew.

31:48.760 --> 31:51.330
He knew it before I even did.

31:51.330 --> 31:54.420
I was coming home every night,
talking about work,

31:54.420 --> 31:57.440
what you had done in court
or what we talked about.

31:57.440 --> 32:01.840
- Maggie--
- Yeah, I think he proposed to get me to forget you.

32:01.840 --> 32:05.550
I think I accepted for the same reason.

32:08.130 --> 32:09.790
I knew.

32:09.790 --> 32:13.660
I knew you didn't feel
the same way as I did.

32:14.220 --> 32:17.350
- I wish--
- You don't.

32:17.350 --> 32:20.350
I get it, Eli.

32:21.500 --> 32:26.400
Anyways, turns out Scott wasn't
the saint I thought he was, was he?

32:26.830 --> 32:30.050
He and Candace have been
getting it on for months.

32:30.050 --> 32:30.810
Candace?

32:30.810 --> 32:34.290
Lucky I wasn't on your green card case,
by the way.

32:34.290 --> 32:37.950
Turns out she's Booker'steam leader at I.C.E.

32:37.950 --> 32:39.670
Talk about conflict of interest.

32:39.670 --> 32:41.980
You're kidding.

32:42.540 --> 32:43.960
I have your boxes, miss Dekker.

32:43.960 --> 32:47.600
Oh, could you please put them by my desk?

32:48.460 --> 32:50.250
So you're...

32:50.250 --> 32:52.370
finally getting your own office?

32:52.370 --> 32:55.930
Well, it's not likewe're short
on space anymore.

32:57.890 --> 33:01.600
I can't stay here, Eli.

33:06.730 --> 33:11.490
I can't let my feelings for you

33:11.490 --> 33:14.630
cost me more than they already have.

33:17.520 --> 33:21.070
Not Posner & Klein.

33:22.430 --> 33:23.560
Don't do that.

33:23.560 --> 33:26.290
You--you don't have to do that.

33:26.290 --> 33:28.580
I do.

33:28.580 --> 33:31.510
I love you, Eli.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.350
But for once...

33:34.350 --> 33:38.890
I'm actually gonna put myself first.

33:49.180 --> 33:51.100
Miss Bonneville?

33:51.100 --> 33:52.730
Hi.

33:52.730 --> 33:53.960
I'm Eli Stone.

33:53.960 --> 33:54.690
Hi.

33:54.690 --> 33:57.010
You're representing Carter Jameson, right?

33:57.010 --> 34:00.630
I, uh, pulled his folder
after I got your message.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.480
You must have really pissed
Charlotte Booker off.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.720
I get the feeling
she's a bit of a sore loser.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.690
She's passionate about her work.

34:09.690 --> 34:13.190
But you're her boss, and, uh,
I know for a fact that

34:13.190 --> 34:16.179
this office has handled dozens
of cases exactly like Carter's

34:16.179 --> 34:20.830
where you have signed off on deals
which involved zero prison time.

34:20.830 --> 34:24.110
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone, but this
isn't gonna be one of them.

34:24.110 --> 34:25.989
I have to accept Charlotte's recommendation.

34:25.989 --> 34:29.190
My people need to know that I trust them.

34:30.020 --> 34:33.260
I feel awful playing this card, but, um,

34:33.260 --> 34:38.290
considering who dealt it to me,
I don't see how I have any choice.

34:40.929 --> 34:43.130
I know about your...

34:43.130 --> 34:46.620
extramarital activities with Scott Clauson.

34:46.620 --> 34:47.290
Pardon me?

34:47.290 --> 34:52.060
I know it's none of my business, but I was...

34:52.060 --> 34:54.260
I think I was meant
to know about your affair so that

34:54.260 --> 34:57.300
I might encourage you to help my client.

34:57.300 --> 34:58.820
Are you blackmailing me?

34:58.820 --> 35:02.210
No. I am just strongly suggesting that

35:02.210 --> 35:05.990
there is a solution opposite to Ms. Booker's...

35:05.990 --> 35:10.470
which you should seriously consider.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.710
Upon further examination of his file,

35:19.710 --> 35:23.100
I do see some ameliorating factors here.

35:23.100 --> 35:26.770
500 hours of community service
and years probation.

35:27.080 --> 35:29.150
Sounds like we have a deal.

35:29.150 --> 35:31.380
Surely you jest, Ms. Dekker.

35:31.380 --> 35:35.890
Our offer of legal employment
is strictly non negotiable.

35:35.890 --> 35:38.110
Nothing's non negotiable, Mr. Posner,

35:38.110 --> 35:40.070
not when both parties have leverage.

35:40.070 --> 35:44.760
I'm well aware of my unique value
to you and Ms. Klein.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.270
Pray tell, Ms. Dekker.

35:46.270 --> 35:51.200
You relish the thought of how much
you think it will hurt Eli if I go work for you.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.140
Do you really have that low
opinion of me?

35:53.140 --> 35:56.300
Lower, actually.

35:56.300 --> 35:59.630
And yet you're willing to work
for me if I meet your terms.

35:59.630 --> 36:04.360
If I can use you to help
the people I want to help, yes.

36:05.930 --> 36:09.300
These are my terms.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.300
Take them or leave them.

36:13.620 --> 36:17.420
Very savy asks...

36:17.950 --> 36:20.550
butt we can live with them.

36:20.550 --> 36:24.060
Welcome to Posner & Klein.

36:25.520 --> 36:31.320
I suspect we're going to discover
still more hidden depths in you, Ms. Dekker.

36:39.750 --> 36:41.610
The prosecution is giving Carter a pass.

36:41.610 --> 36:44.640
I know. Sana just called to thank me.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.890
How did you do it?

36:45.890 --> 36:47.300
Friends in high places.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.910
Yeah.

36:49.630 --> 36:51.120
We did good.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.360
We did.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.060
So why are you packing?

36:55.100 --> 36:59.560
What we did this week, I have never felt so...

36:59.820 --> 37:03.160
gratified, so relieved by a win.

37:03.160 --> 37:07.740
Which means that Taylor's half-baked plan
worked, and you're supposed to stay now.

37:07.740 --> 37:12.200
Stone, I haven't slept in three days.

37:12.200 --> 37:15.460
I've been wearing the same
stinkin' shirt since tuesday,

37:15.460 --> 37:18.970
and I haven't sweat this bad
since I ran the bay to breakers marathon.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.360
That's because the case mattered to you, Matt.

37:21.360 --> 37:22.630
That's what it feels like.

37:22.630 --> 37:24.250
That's exactly my point.

37:24.250 --> 37:27.470
I like a good night's sleep,
and the only occasion

37:27.470 --> 37:31.950
where I enjoy sweating
isn't in the courtroom.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.590
Nah. This isn't me, Eli.

37:34.590 --> 37:36.130
You saved Sana's life.

37:36.130 --> 37:39.070
Yeah, and it nearly ended mine.

37:39.790 --> 37:44.280
I don't know how I would have lived
with myself if we'd lost that.

37:44.280 --> 37:49.600
Listen, man, I admire what you do.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.740
It's just not what I do.

37:55.800 --> 37:58.380
What about Taylor?

37:58.610 --> 38:00.210
She'll be fine.

38:00.210 --> 38:02.420
You should be worried about yourself.

38:02.420 --> 38:03.760
Why?

38:03.760 --> 38:05.420
Because the next time
we're in court together,

38:05.420 --> 38:08.990
it'll be my job to shred you.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.950
I'm sorry.

38:14.950 --> 38:16.610
Don't be.

38:16.610 --> 38:17.760
You made your own decision.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.210
That's what I wanted you to do.

38:19.210 --> 38:20.520
Please don't take it personally.

38:20.520 --> 38:22.590
You saw what this trial did to me.

38:22.590 --> 38:24.440
I just...

38:24.440 --> 38:26.210
I don't do emotional, Taylor.

38:26.210 --> 38:28.450
You know that.

38:28.830 --> 38:30.010
I do.

38:30.010 --> 38:33.800
Anyway, think how much more fun
seeing each other at night's gonna be

38:33.800 --> 38:37.360
when we haven't seen each other all day.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.500
I made reservations at masa's.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.750
8:00 okay?

38:44.750 --> 38:46.830
Great.

38:56.490 --> 38:58.410
Hi.

38:59.110 --> 39:00.740
Hello.

39:00.740 --> 39:06.980
So rumor has it that Posner made every 
member of staff here an offer,

39:06.980 --> 39:08.560
including you.

39:08.560 --> 39:13.290
Just so you know, um,
out of all the people here,

39:13.290 --> 39:16.520
you're the one I could never lose.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.410
I mean that, Patti.

39:18.410 --> 39:22.870
Well, I mean, lord knows
you'd be useless without me.

39:22.870 --> 39:24.560
Looks like, uh, you're not 
the only one, too.

39:24.560 --> 39:28.270
I saw John in the elevator,
Betty in the kitchen.

39:28.270 --> 39:31.100
Whatever you said to them must have worked.

39:31.100 --> 39:34.070
I guess we got a lot of sappy
idealists around here.

39:34.070 --> 39:35.710
I guess.

39:35.710 --> 39:38.110
Well, you can tell those sappy idealists
who stayed on that

39:38.110 --> 39:40.630
we will unfreeze their raises 
for next year.

39:40.630 --> 39:43.700
Yeah, it's not as much as what Posner offered,
and it's not what you all deserve,

39:43.700 --> 39:45.840
but we're gonna do what we can.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.090
I'll take it out of my own salary 
if I have to.

39:48.090 --> 39:49.320
Really, Eli?

39:49.320 --> 39:54.270
This is a new firm, Patti,
and we may have to improvise,

39:54.270 --> 39:58.110
but we're gonna figure out a way
to be the best firm that we can.

39:58.530 --> 40:04.490
Now if you would be so kind,
may I have my wackadoo file?

40:04.490 --> 40:06.890
Of course.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.790
Just the man I was looking for.

40:13.790 --> 40:15.980
I trust it wasn't too difficult to find me.

40:15.980 --> 40:19.390
Our ranks are considerably thinned.

40:19.700 --> 40:21.390
Thinned...

40:21.390 --> 40:24.450
but strengthened.

40:24.970 --> 40:27.100
Certainly there are plenty
of empty offices now

40:27.100 --> 40:29.280
if you want to move out of the library.

40:29.280 --> 40:33.440
Oh, thank you, sir, but, uh,
I think I'll stay.

40:33.440 --> 40:36.000
Sentimental reasons, you know?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.880
That I do.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.680
What's that?

40:39.680 --> 40:40.690
New cases.

40:40.690 --> 40:41.560
New clients.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.650
I was just bringing it by your office.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.870
Or we could start fresh
tomorrow if you like.

40:46.870 --> 40:48.840
No, no. Now would be fine.

40:48.840 --> 40:51.960
But first there was something
I wanted to give you.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.330
To new beginnings...

41:00.330 --> 41:02.580
partner.

41:05.440 --> 41:08.280
New beginnings.
