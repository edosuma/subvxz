<i>A life that is full</i>

01:02.295 --> 01:04.197
<i>Every day is the same.</i>

01:05.932 --> 01:08.835
<i>I get up. Get ready for work,</i>

01:20.914 --> 01:23.650

01:25.852 --> 01:27.120

01:28.521 --> 01:31.157
<i>Three days ago, I died.</i>

01:32.559 --> 01:34.461
<i>And they think I'm fine,</i>

01:35.328 --> 01:36.930

01:44.771 --> 01:47.874
So, you ready to jump?

01:58.451 --> 02:00.887
Would you just piss off?
Get off my roof.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.322
Your roof?

02:02.388 --> 02:05.091
I'm going to jump,
so just leave me alone.

02:05.158 --> 02:08.628
Look, darling, you know,
I'm not here to stop you.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.630
Seriously.

02:10.697 --> 02:16.035
You think you've got problems?
What, did your man dump you?

02:16.102 --> 02:19.205
Sorry, love, are you talking
to me? It's just I'm
a bit busy right now.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.774
I'm not really interested
in listening...

02:24.911 --> 02:26.546
What is that?

02:26.613 --> 02:27.714
I got shot.

02:28.748 --> 02:30.049
Yeah, right.

02:40.426 --> 02:44.063
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you?

02:46.132 --> 02:47.433
I'm dead.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.439
That's not...
Look, you can't be dead.

02:53.506 --> 02:57.911
You're standing here.
You're talking, you're moving.
You're not dead!

03:00.513 --> 03:02.882
You're... You're dead!

03:02.949 --> 03:04.984
Yeah, I was brought back.

03:05.051 --> 03:07.854
Like Jesus, really,
but without the beard,
you know.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.857
Shit, I'm never gonna have
a beard. Not that I wanted
one, you understand,

03:10.924 --> 03:14.761
-but, you know, one day I...
-Okay. Okay.
You're dead and that's...

03:14.827 --> 03:17.363
That's clearly a bit shit
and I'm sorry and everything

03:17.430 --> 03:20.500
but if you are dead,
then why are you here?

03:20.567 --> 03:23.570
You can't be wanting to jump.
You can't die twice!

03:23.636 --> 03:27.941
-Sorry, are you an expert?
-Sorry, are you an idiot?

03:28.007 --> 03:33.012
-Yeah. I'm a dead idiot.
-So,
come on then, what's it like?

03:33.880 --> 03:34.981
What?

03:37.850 --> 03:39.886
Well, being dead.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.488
What delights have I
got to look forward to?

03:42.555 --> 03:44.190

03:45.625 --> 03:46.893
Nothing.

03:47.994 --> 03:49.596
Cheery, thanks.

Bollocks.
I'm sorry,
Jack, this is bollocks!

04:04.477 --> 04:06.245
Hand in your weapon
and your security pass.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.714
Why? I'm fine.

04:07.780 --> 04:10.750
Three days ago, you died.
We need to examine you.

04:12.652 --> 04:16.222
We need to find
out what you are.

04:16.289 --> 04:17.557
We need to be
certain you're okay.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.859
Yeah, it almost sounds
as if you care. Well done.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.395
Until I'm confident
you're fit for duty,

04:22.462 --> 04:25.565
Martha Jones will replace you
as Torchwood's
new medical officer.

04:25.632 --> 04:27.500
She's doing all
right out of this,
isn't she?

04:27.567 --> 04:30.236
She's worked out
a series of tests
and examinations.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.904
What if I refuse?

04:31.971 --> 04:33.840
You'll be
confined to the cells,
the tests will be done

04:33.906 --> 04:36.409
and if the results show
that you're
a danger to the team,

04:36.476 --> 04:38.778
appropriate
steps will be taken.

04:40.647 --> 04:43.416
I'm asking you, Owen. Please.

04:44.183 --> 04:45.752
Let us help you.

04:47.186 --> 04:49.489
Let us make sure you're safe.

04:49.555 --> 04:50.957
(SIGHS)

04:51.024 --> 04:52.592
I'm going to need your gun.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.609
And your security pass.

05:11.544 --> 05:12.679
Please.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.163
And how long
are Dr Jones's
tests going to take?

05:30.229 --> 05:32.765
As long as they need to.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.768
And what the hell
am I supposed to do
in the meantime?

05:35.835 --> 05:38.371
We always need
someone to make coffee.

05:38.438 --> 05:39.372
Oh, no.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.977
Voila. Fresh and strong.

05:50.116 --> 05:52.719
And we couldn't just have
a jar of instant, no?

05:52.785 --> 05:54.187
I thought you
liked your coffee?

05:54.253 --> 05:55.621
Have you seen what happens
when I drink these days?

05:55.688 --> 05:58.624
Yeah, thank you, Owen.
Do you want a go?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.059
Ooh, please.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.504
Come on.
What's wrong with this?

06:11.571 --> 06:13.139
You, umm...

06:21.848 --> 06:23.182
You okay?

06:23.983 --> 06:26.052
What do you think?

06:26.119 --> 06:29.322
I bet you're
loving this, aren't you?
It's like you've finally won.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.224
I didn't realise we
were in competition.

06:31.290 --> 06:34.861
Oh, come on! Even Tosh
had more of a life
than you used to.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.562
And now you're
always out on missions,

06:36.629 --> 06:38.397
you're shagging Jack and
I'm stuck here
making the coffee.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.700
It's not like that.

06:40.767 --> 06:46.205
-Me and Jack.
-Yeah, yeah. You and Jack.

06:46.272 --> 06:49.075
Gwen's getting married.
Martha's got her bloke.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.378
God, even Tosh had Tommy.
This is really shit.

06:53.579 --> 06:56.382
We've all gone through shit.

06:56.449 --> 07:00.787
I've seen you
dissecting alien corpses.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.655
I've seen you
save so many lives.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.260
Are you really
gonna let this beat you?

07:14.333 --> 07:15.501
(BEEPING)

07:18.437 --> 07:21.007
So, you're choosing me
over the boyfriend?

07:21.073 --> 07:23.309
Yeah, that's it.

07:23.376 --> 07:26.245
You really don't need
to worry, you know,
I don't want your job.

07:26.312 --> 07:29.148
Yes, I know.
You just find me irresistible.

07:29.215 --> 07:31.250
Oh, yeah. That's it.

07:31.317 --> 07:36.522
Every morning I wake up
and think of ways to get
you alone like this.

07:36.589 --> 07:40.726
There is no sign of any muscle
decay. You're in great shape,
as ever.

07:40.793 --> 07:44.597
No use coming onto me, Jones.
I'm a changed man.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.466
And no stiffening anywhere?

07:47.533 --> 07:48.868
Well...

07:48.935 --> 07:50.870
Just answer the question.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.872
No, no signs of rigor mortis.

07:55.908 --> 07:59.011
So, if I keep up
the exercise, I won't atrophy?

07:59.078 --> 08:03.182
Yep. And a bonus, definitely
looks like you're not
going to age either.

08:04.450 --> 08:07.119
There's no further sign
of cell mutation.

08:07.186 --> 08:09.789
You're 100% human.

08:10.389 --> 08:11.757
100% Owen.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.426
(INTERCOM BEEPS)

GWEN:<i> Hi, Martha.</i>
<i>Meeting in the boardroom.</i>

08:14.927 --> 08:16.395
<i>Can you come down?</i>

08:18.865 --> 08:21.033
You'd better go. Doctor.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.503
What about you?

08:24.570 --> 08:27.139
-Cappuccino with
chocolate sprinkles.
-What?

08:28.608 --> 08:30.376
That's what you drink,
isn't it?

08:38.451 --> 08:40.486
Henry John Parker.
Used to be a looker,

08:40.553 --> 08:43.923
now he's 80 odd
and even I have my limits.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.826
Your basic
millionaire collector
of alien hoo-hah.

08:46.893 --> 08:49.195
Didn't we file him
in the "mostly
harmless" category?

08:49.262 --> 08:53.599
-So, what's the problem?
-I detected this at
5:17 this morning.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.202
TOSHIKO: Parker's house.
There's an energy
spike coming from it.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.471
I've never seen
anything like it before.

08:58.537 --> 09:02.108
Okay. So, the big question is,
what's our Mr Parker gone
and found this time?

09:02.174 --> 09:03.943
Why?
Do you think he's a threat?

09:04.010 --> 09:07.146
Well,
he hasn't been up until now.
He's a bit Howard Hughes.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.082
We know he's there,
we know he's not a threat,

09:10.149 --> 09:13.986
but, as the story goes,
he hasn't left
the house since his wife died.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.655
Nobody's seen him since 1986.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.556
We've been
monitoring Parker for ages.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.892
There's nothing
to be scared of,
is there?

09:22.061 --> 09:23.796
Unlike, say, Tintin?

09:26.198 --> 09:29.035
Okay, I never liked Tintin.

09:29.101 --> 09:32.672
What, he's weird. Funny face.
And his hair is just,
it's horrible.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.507
-I always loved Tintin.
-Well, you would.

09:34.573 --> 09:36.509
And he never had a girlfriend,
did he, just the dog.

09:36.575 --> 09:39.812
So I reckon
he was actually
shagging the dog.

09:39.879 --> 09:44.150
Okay,
meanwhile, back at Torchwood.
Alien energy pulse.

09:44.216 --> 09:46.085
We've got to check
this Parker out, okay?

09:46.152 --> 09:48.754
Tosh, can you get me
a complete
schematic of the house?

09:48.821 --> 09:50.790
Ianto, find out
exactly what he's got.

09:50.856 --> 09:53.592
Get me an inventory
of everything that he's bought
over the last 10 years.

09:53.659 --> 09:55.561
Martha, can you get a hold
of his medical history.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.897
-Sure.
-GWEN:
Okay, let's get to it, guys.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.968

arrested in Lanzarote.

GWEN: Ah, dodgy CDs.

10:08.607 --> 10:12.745
OWEN:<i> Worldwide,</i>
<i>nearly a million people</i>
<i>kill themselves each year.</i>

10:15.848 --> 10:19.552
That's almost three times
the population of Cardiff.

10:19.618 --> 10:20.786
Makes you think.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.955
What are you?
Some sort of suicide geek?

10:23.022 --> 10:24.657
No, just a doctor.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.594
In fact,
I'm not just a doctor.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.931
I'm a bloody brilliant doctor.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.433
-MARTHA: I know you are.
-So why are you doing my job?

10:34.500 --> 10:38.104
-Because Gwen asked me to.
-That's not what I mean.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.906
Because you died,

10:40.973 --> 10:43.109
and because you need help.
That's not a bad thing.

10:43.175 --> 10:45.211
Well, it is a bad thing
that you died, obviously,

10:45.277 --> 10:48.547
but it's not bad
that you need help.
If you know what I mean.

10:48.614 --> 10:50.483
You're kinda cute
when you babble.

10:50.549 --> 10:53.185
And you're kinda cute when
you're not
chucking a scalpel about.

10:53.252 --> 10:55.621
But I'm making
the sodding coffee!

10:55.688 --> 10:57.957
I mean, come on,
won't your bloke
be missing you?

10:58.024 --> 11:00.726
How about Jack? Has he seen
Jack? They always get jealous
when they meet Jack.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.396
Owen, I don't want your job.
I just want to do mine.

11:03.462 --> 11:06.632
Okay, I'm dead,
but I am 100% human.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.368
I'm fine.

11:09.435 --> 11:11.570
You've sliced your hand open.

11:20.746 --> 11:22.948
The wound's not
going to heal, so,

11:23.015 --> 11:26.252
you're going to have to
re-stitch it every week or so.

11:26.318 --> 11:27.987
At least you don't
need anaesthetic.

11:30.156 --> 11:33.526
Yeah, can't feel anything.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.461
I can't feel
the needle or thread.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.197
I can't feel
your hands on mine.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.666
Yet I can touch things.

11:40.733 --> 11:43.002
I can hold them.

11:43.069 --> 11:45.404
I know they're there, but

11:45.471 --> 11:48.007
I just can't feel anything.

11:49.308 --> 11:50.843
I'm numb.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.345
Do you see why Jack's worried?

11:53.412 --> 11:56.348
Bruises won't heal,
bones won't mend.
You're fragile.

11:59.985 --> 12:04.990
Yeah,
well, I'd better get used
to doing things myself.

<i>So she offers to help you</i>
<i>and you push her away.</i>

12:10.329 --> 12:11.730

12:11.797 --> 12:14.100
Yeah, hole in the chest.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.269
Sorry if I don't follow
social niceties any more.

12:17.336 --> 12:19.872
You mean you did before?

12:19.939 --> 12:22.908
God,
you're a pain in the arse,
aren't you?

12:22.975 --> 12:26.011
Is that why your
man dumped you?

12:26.078 --> 12:29.515
Oh, I hit a nerve?
What, did you get
your heart broken?

12:31.951 --> 12:33.552
No, actually. He died.

12:35.621 --> 12:37.289
I'm sorry.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.024
No, you're not.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.327
You couldn't
care less about me
and I don't care about you.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.162
Just because we're both
planning on jumping,

12:43.229 --> 12:47.433
it doesn't mean

-Fine. I might as
well go home, then.
-Okay.

do when I get there?

13:15.094 --> 13:19.431

Jack, I'm dead.
I'm permanently chilled.

You know,
you get to live forever.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.174

Get him to open up,

It's all about Owen.

found out about Parker?

I've identified some
of the things he's purchased
over the past year.

A pair of Myakian wings,
some meteorites.

we've never seen before.

So one of these is
causing the energy spikes?

21:45.971 --> 21:48.140
Looks like it, and they're
getting bigger.
Dangerously bigger.

21:48.206 --> 21:50.809
Right, okay,
we need to get in there.

21:50.876 --> 21:54.546
Parker employs
a Mr Philip Farrington
to run security.

21:54.613 --> 21:56.882
There's at least six guards,
CCTV everywhere.

21:56.948 --> 21:59.885
All of which we can bring down
by taking out the generator.

How did you get
from that to here?

23:40.118 --> 23:41.486

If you hurt yourself,
you will not recover.

any bruises you get,
they're not going to heal.

Do not engage in
physical combat.

-I named it.

No! You're not taking it.

-Well, I'm sorry, it doesn't.
-What?

32:44.028 --> 32:46.964
The energy isn't
going into you.

32:47.031 --> 32:48.866
The power's just building up
inside that thing.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.369
That's what
we've been detecting

32:51.436 --> 32:54.339

doing anything for you.

of people's lives at risk.

If that thing explodes,
then we don't know what
the fall-out will be.

33:06.050 --> 33:10.121
You're young,
you don't understand
what dying feels like.

33:10.188 --> 33:13.024
Believe me, I do. I really do.

33:13.091 --> 33:15.560
-There's nothing there!
-Where?

33:15.626 --> 33:18.863
On the other side, nothing,

33:18.930 --> 33:23.868
I'm dying.

Pulse and I'm gone.

but it's going
to happen one day.

It'll be dark
and I'll be alone.

Where are you now?
It's dark,
and you're all alone.

33:41.452 --> 33:44.155
So what's the difference?

I don't understand
what's keeping me here.

(COUGHING)

33:52.897 --> 33:55.133
Deep breath, deep breath.

34:04.175 --> 34:05.777
It's hope.

34:06.911 --> 34:09.881
That thing, it's just hope.

34:09.947 --> 34:14.919
Do you really think
all this is better than death?

34:14.986 --> 34:18.189
It's got to be. It is better!

34:18.256 --> 34:20.825
You're just
scared of the darkness.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.260
Join the club.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.631
Trust me,
I know how shit
everything can be.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.701
Don't you sit
there pontificating.

34:30.768 --> 34:34.338
You're just a boy.
What do you know
about anything?

34:34.405 --> 34:38.509
I've travelled the world.
I fought in the war.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.780
Started my own business.
I made a fortune!

34:43.614 --> 34:46.951
Married. Widowed.

34:47.018 --> 34:51.722
My collection, all of it,
I've done so much.

34:51.789 --> 34:56.160
And this is where
I ended up, alone,

34:56.227 --> 34:58.396
lying in my own piss.

34:59.997 --> 35:01.899
And do you know what I want?

35:02.767 --> 35:03.968
Clean sheets?

35:04.035 --> 35:06.571
I want a steak.

35:06.637 --> 35:09.740
Medium rare.
Black pepper sauce.

35:11.209 --> 35:15.179
Look at me.
Fed through a tube.

35:15.246 --> 35:17.548
I might as well
be dead already.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.687
I might as well be dead.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.125
Why don't you take it?

35:31.062 --> 35:32.463
Take it.

35:43.674 --> 35:45.009
Well?

35:45.076 --> 35:47.712
Oh, Christ, it's dark.

35:47.778 --> 35:49.046
I'm alone, I'm so alone.

35:50.448 --> 35:53.384
It's all right,
I'm here with you.

35:53.451 --> 35:54.819
(MOANS)

35:54.886 --> 35:57.221
I'm still stuck here, though.

35:57.288 --> 35:59.490
In this bed. In the dark.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.827
You know what?

36:02.894 --> 36:04.529
I'm going to come back.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.298
You and me,

36:07.365 --> 36:10.368
we're going to face
all of this together.

36:11.369 --> 36:13.938
I'm going to help you.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.308
Torchwood! If you come back,

36:17.375 --> 36:19.043
you can tell me all about it.

36:19.110 --> 36:21.045
Tell me what it's like.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.447
I want to hear about
the aliens and everything!

36:23.514 --> 36:27.818
I need to know
that there's more out there.

36:27.885 --> 36:30.521
That this isn't all there is.

36:32.089 --> 36:35.560
Oh, come on, I'm dying.

36:35.626 --> 36:38.129
Who am I going to tell?
The Angel Gabriel?

36:40.031 --> 36:42.233
If you come back,

36:43.534 --> 36:46.771
I won't tell the Japanese girl

36:46.837 --> 36:49.407
that you're still
holding my hand.

36:51.208 --> 36:52.577
Well, maybe.

36:55.313 --> 36:56.714
(GASPING)

37:01.819 --> 37:03.287
Take a deep breath.

37:04.922 --> 37:06.023

Henry?

37:37.154 --> 37:38.689
I'm so sorry.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.157
I'm so sorry!

37:44.261 --> 37:45.896
OWEN:<i> I couldn't save him.</i>

37:48.366 --> 37:51.369
He needed me
to give him air,
but I couldn't.

37:54.138 --> 37:55.606
I've got no breath.

37:57.708 --> 38:02.446
Everything I've seen,
everything that's out there,

38:04.348 --> 38:08.886
and it was an old man
dying of a heart attack.

38:08.953 --> 38:12.790
It was just
another person dying
because of me.

38:12.857 --> 38:17.128
Everything that's happened
and that was the final straw.

38:17.194 --> 38:19.930
Because at that moment,

38:19.997 --> 38:23.067
I just wanted it all to end.

38:24.168 --> 38:26.103
TOSHIKO:<i> Owen.</i>

38:26.170 --> 38:28.205
<i>Owen, can you hear me?</i>

38:28.272 --> 38:30.641
Owen, come in!

38:30.708 --> 38:34.779
-Yes. Yeah, I'm here.
-The device?
Is it doing anything

38:34.845 --> 38:39.483
because the energy levels
coming from it are... Owen?

38:39.550 --> 38:43.020
It's going off the screen.
It's going to explode!

38:43.087 --> 38:46.390
-Tosh, what can we do?
-Nothing! There's nothing!

38:46.457 --> 38:50.461
It's okay.
I'm going to hold it.

38:50.528 --> 38:53.831
-Owen, what are you doing?
-OWEN:<i> See if I can absorb it.</i>

38:53.898 --> 38:58.469
Owen, the energy reading's
off the scale.
You won't survive.

38:58.536 --> 39:02.406
It's okay,
these things happen.

39:02.473 --> 39:03.874
There must be
something we can do.

39:03.941 --> 39:06.110
<i>-Martha! Martha.</i>
-Owen?

39:06.177 --> 39:09.547
If it destroys me,
they're going to
need a new doctor.

<i>You've got all</i>

We all assume
life's going to be shit,
don't we?

40:27.324 --> 40:29.860
That it's all just darkness.

40:32.997 --> 40:34.565
But you know what?

40:35.900 --> 40:37.735
Sometimes it's not.

40:55.586 --> 40:57.054
What is it?

40:58.622 --> 41:01.592
Do you remember in the '70s,

41:01.659 --> 41:03.861
NASA sent messages into space.

41:04.128 --> 41:07.498
A map of our solar system,
pictures of what we look like.

41:07.565 --> 41:10.668
It had images, voices, music.

41:11.869 --> 41:13.971
Even a bit of Chuck Berry.

41:15.272 --> 41:18.576
Well, this is a reply.

41:19.677 --> 41:22.246
Not that we know who from.

41:23.814 --> 41:25.449
Well, what does it do?

41:27.852 --> 41:29.186
It sang to me.

41:31.689 --> 41:35.125
It's a glimmer of
light in the darkness.

41:36.327 --> 41:40.865
See?
Sometimes it does get better.

42:01.585 --> 42:05.322

I was going to say fine,
but you're a hell of a lot
more than that.

42:14.932 --> 42:16.567
Thank you.

-Okay.

-Well, it's been interesting.
-Oh, it's been fun.

43:42.619 --> 43:43.687
Okay.

43:45.389 --> 43:48.192
Tosh, I'm scared.

I'm scared that
if I close my eyes,
I'll get trapped.

came here to jump.
-No.

-What do I do now?
-You've got a choice.

44:59.396 --> 45:03.067
If you think
that the darkness is too much

45:04.635 --> 45:07.304
then go for it.

45:07.371 --> 45:09.940
But if there is a chance,

45:11.308 --> 45:12.776
just some hope...

45:16.513 --> 45:18.649
It could be
having a cigarette,

45:18.715 --> 45:21.418
or that first sip of hot tea
on a cold morning.

45:23.187 --> 45:25.155
Or it could be your mates.

45:27.858 --> 45:32.062
If there is even
a tiny glimmer of light

45:34.098 --> 45:36.633
then don't you think
that's worth taking a chance?
