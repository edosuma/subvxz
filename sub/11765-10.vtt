WEBVTT

00:00.431 --> 00:01.702
HA!

00:01.702 --> 00:03.704
WOW. DOES THAT SPIDER
OWE YOU MONEY?

00:03.704 --> 00:05.406
YOU STILL HAVE
LITTLE SPIDER LEGS

00:05.406 --> 00:08.339
TWITCHING ON YOUR MAN HANDS.
MAN HANDS?

00:08.339 --> 00:10.311
YOU'RE STEALING JOKES
FROM SEINFELD NOW?

00:10.311 --> 00:12.443
WAS THAT THAT JEWISH GUY
YOU DATED IN HIGH SCHOOL?

00:12.443 --> 00:13.644
NO.

00:13.644 --> 00:16.117
HE HAD A HUGE TV SHOW?
"MUST SEE TV"?

00:16.117 --> 00:17.618
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.450
NO ONE'S GONNA TELL ME
WHAT'S "MUST SEE."

00:19.450 --> 00:21.492
I HAVE ALL THESE CONFUSING
FEELINGS FOR TRAVIS,

00:21.492 --> 00:23.454
AND NOW HE'S OUT THERE
PLAYING THE FIELD,

00:23.454 --> 00:25.296
AND IT JUST MAKES ME
WANT TO HULK OUT

00:25.296 --> 00:27.328
AND DESTROY THINGS.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.260
(imitating The Incredible Hulk)
JELLY HULK JEALOUS.

00:29.260 --> 00:31.602
JELLY HULK SMASH.

00:31.602 --> 00:33.664
JELLY HULK WEAR TACKY JEWELRY.

00:33.664 --> 00:36.437
(growls)

00:36.437 --> 00:37.808
(normal voice)
I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU.

00:37.808 --> 00:39.670
UGH!

00:39.670 --> 00:42.143
HEY, WHO WANTS A PIPING-HOT
CINNAMON BUN?

00:42.143 --> 00:43.574
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH TRAV?

00:43.574 --> 00:45.316
I SAW HIM IN TOWN
MAKING OUT WITH SOME GIRL.

00:45.316 --> 00:47.278
HE WAS BATTING AROUND
HER TONSILS LIKE A SPEED BAG.

00:47.278 --> 00:48.679
LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA.

00:48.679 --> 00:50.581
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!

00:50.581 --> 00:52.052
SHUT UP!
OW! THAT BURNS!

00:52.052 --> 00:55.086
I CAN'T GET THE FROSTING
OFF MY EYE!

00:55.086 --> 00:56.727
(thud)
OH, GOD, IT'S SEARING MY EYE!

00:56.727 --> 01:01.232
(whispers)
NOW I'M A LITTLE AFRAID.

01:01.232 --> 01:06.267
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:06.267 --> 01:09.840
I JUST LOVED HIM,
YOU KNOW?

01:09.840 --> 01:12.443
(sighs) I GUESS I SHOULD'VE
TOLD HIM MORE.

01:12.443 --> 01:15.546
I JUST THOUGHT
HE'D BE HERE FOREVER.

01:15.546 --> 01:17.678
MICHAEL JACKSON'S DEATH
AFFECTED EVERYBODY.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.651
I KNOW SOME PHARMACISTS
THAT ARE PRETTY HEARTBROKEN.

01:20.651 --> 01:22.082
(laughs)

01:22.082 --> 01:23.284
LYNN, I LOVE YOU,

01:23.284 --> 01:24.655
BUT IF YOU TRASH
THE KING OF POP,

01:24.655 --> 01:26.717
I WILL BURN
THIS PLACE TO THE GROUND.

01:26.717 --> 01:30.721
AND THAT IS A GREAT TOPIC
FOR NEXT WEEK.

01:30.721 --> 01:32.563
WELL, ANOTHER FUN ONE.
(chuckles)

01:32.563 --> 01:34.595
YOU KNOW, I BET IF WE MET
ON THE STREET,

01:34.595 --> 01:36.497
WE'D END UP BEING FRIENDS.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.229
I'D LOVE TO HANG OUT.

01:38.229 --> 01:39.700
EVER SINCE
MY HUSBAND REGGIE DIED, I--

01:39.700 --> 01:41.872
WELL, I DON'T--
I DON'T GET OUT VERY MUCH.

01:41.872 --> 01:44.835
I USED TO HAVE A BEST FRIEND,

01:44.835 --> 01:46.807
BUT THEN I FOUND OUT THAT REGGIE
WAS ALSO MARRIED TO HER,

01:46.807 --> 01:50.611
SO... (sighs) SO, YOU KNOW,
THAT--THAT'S DONE.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.383
SHOCKINGLY, THAT IS ONLY
THE FIFTH SADDEST STORY

01:52.383 --> 01:53.884
YOU'VE EVER TOLD ME.

01:55.846 --> 01:59.119
WHY DO YOU WASTE YOUR TIME?
I MEAN, THERAPY IS SUCH A SHAM.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.323
BEFORE THERAPY, I WAS
A PEOPLE-PLEASING CONTROL FREAK.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.526
I WAS CONSTANTLY OBSESSED
ABOUT TRAVIS.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.898
YOU HAVE COME A LONG WAY.

02:07.898 --> 02:09.700
YOU JOKE,
BUT I WAS WAY WORSE.

02:09.700 --> 02:11.632
I KEPT A BABY MONITOR
IN TRAVIS' ROOM

02:11.632 --> 02:14.165
UNTIL HE WAS 17.

02:14.165 --> 02:16.607
(click)
(Andy) ELLIE, DO YOU THINK
WE'LL ALWAYS LIVE IN FLORIDA?

02:16.607 --> 02:19.270
(Ellie) WHY AREN'T YOU
AT WORK YET?

02:19.270 --> 02:22.373
(click)
YEAH. I HID IT IN THEIR HOUSE
IN CASE THEY TALK ABOUT ME.

02:22.373 --> 02:23.644
SO WHAT?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.246
I DON'T NEED A SHRINK.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.448
I MEAN, I CAN TELL YOU
ALL MY WEIRD STUFF.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.749
OKAY. I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED,

02:28.749 --> 02:30.651
WHY DO YOU TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF
WHEN YOU PEE?

02:30.651 --> 02:32.453
WELL, WHAT AM I GONNA DO,
STAND THERE WITH 'EM

02:32.453 --> 02:34.385
AROUND MY ANKLES
LIKE A LITTLE BITCH?

02:34.385 --> 02:37.157
THIS IS FUN. UM, ALL RIGHT.
I HAVE ANOTHER ONE.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.560
YOUR MODELING CAREER--
WH--HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

02:39.560 --> 02:42.193
GUY STOPPED ME ON THE STREET,
PUT ME IN A MUSIC VIDEO.

02:42.193 --> 02:44.695
THE CRAZY PART--
THE GUY WAS BLIND.

02:44.695 --> 02:48.469
YEAH, HE DECIDED I WAS BEAUTIFUL
WITH HIS HANDS.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.472
OH, BABE.
HE WASN'T BLIND.
OH, HE WAS.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.674
I USED TO HAVE TO GET IN THE TUB
AND HELP HIM BATHE.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.476
YOU SO DON'T NEED THERAPY.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.848
MNH-MNH.

02:57.848 --> 02:59.250
(both laughing)

02:59.250 --> 03:01.452
HEY, GUYS.
HEY, JERRY.

03:01.452 --> 03:03.554
YOU KNOW, I FEEL REALLY CRAPPY
ABOUT THAT 6 BUCKS I OWE YOU.

03:03.554 --> 03:05.416
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO
DOUBLE OR NOTHING?

03:05.416 --> 03:06.817
WHAT NUMBER AM I THINKING?

03:06.817 --> 03:08.819
UH, 6.

03:08.819 --> 03:11.962
DAMN IT. (laughs) OH, IT'S
'CAUSE I JUST SAID THAT NUMBER.

03:11.962 --> 03:14.225
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
LET ME SETTLE THIS.

03:14.225 --> 03:15.966
OH, I, UH, I CAN'T
TAKE MONEY FROM THE MAYOR.

03:15.966 --> 03:17.598
(laughs)

03:17.598 --> 03:19.570
WAIT. WHAT? I'M THE MAYOR?

03:19.570 --> 03:20.771
YEAH, FOR LIKE A MONTH.

03:20.771 --> 03:22.433
HOW AM I DOING?
I DON'T KNOW.

03:22.433 --> 03:25.806
I FORGOT I RAN FOR THAT.
MAYOR ANDO. MANDO.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.838
(laughs) I WON SOMETHING.
HOW'D I MISS THAT?

03:27.838 --> 03:30.681
I GOTTA START CHECKING
MY VOICE MAIL.
(cell phone beeps)

03:30.681 --> 03:33.514
I GOT, LIKE,
A HUNDRED MESSAGES! (laughs)

03:33.514 --> 03:35.946
(Alanis Morissette)
в™Є DEAR TERRENCE в™Є

03:35.946 --> 03:38.319
в™Є I LOVE YOU MUCHLY в™Є

03:38.319 --> 03:40.591
WHY ARE WE WATCHING
AN ALANIS MORISSETTE VIDEO?

03:40.591 --> 03:41.992
BECAUSE OF THIS.

03:41.992 --> 03:43.854
BOOM!

03:43.854 --> 03:45.596
(laughs)

03:45.596 --> 03:47.658
NO WAY!

03:47.658 --> 03:50.230
THANK YOU. PLAY IT AGAIN.
PLAY IT FOREVER.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.732
OH, LOOK AT HIS HAIR.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.764
HE LOOKS LIKE THAT
NERDY LESBIAN FROM "SCOOBY-DOO."

03:53.764 --> 03:55.005
(Ellie and Travis laugh)

03:55.005 --> 03:56.707
WHO LOOKS LIKE VELMA?

03:56.707 --> 03:59.009
(imitates Scooby-Doo)
RUH-ROH. IT'S RAYSON.

03:59.009 --> 04:00.911
в™Є BEAUTIFUL IT WAS TO... в™Є

04:00.911 --> 04:02.873
NOT COOL.

04:02.873 --> 04:04.845
WHAT'S UP HIS BUTT?

04:04.845 --> 04:07.348
MY GUESS IS ALANIS' FINGER
AT THE WRAP PARTY.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.850
(all laugh)

04:12.683 --> 04:13.884
(clears throat)

04:13.884 --> 04:15.386
OH, MY MONEY'S NO GOOD HERE.

04:15.386 --> 04:16.987
I'M THE FIRST LADY
OF GULFHAVEN.

04:16.987 --> 04:20.030
(chuckles) IT DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.935
SO WHAT DO YOU GET TO DO
AS MAYOR OF THIS TINY TOWN?

04:24.935 --> 04:27.037
OH, NOT MUCH.
IT'S MOSTLY CEREMONIAL.

04:27.037 --> 04:28.969
I GOTTA GO TO THIS MEETING
EVERY SIX MONTHS.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.942
UH, OH, UH, THIS, UH,
THIS AFTERNOON,

04:31.942 --> 04:34.845
I GET TO DO A RIBBON CUTTING
AT A NEW BIKE RACK.

04:34.845 --> 04:37.047
OOH, YOU GET TO USE
THOSE GIANT SCISSORS?

04:37.047 --> 04:39.810
UH, NO. YOU GOTTA BRING
YOUR OWN.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.382
UH-OH.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.414
AND THEY LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

04:43.414 --> 04:46.687
DID THEY? OR DID THEY
WIND UP IN THE FOUNTAIN?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.319
AAH!

04:49.690 --> 04:52.292
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN!
GET A NEW HOBBY!

04:52.292 --> 04:54.365
WOW.

04:54.365 --> 04:55.896
IS SHE GONE?

04:55.896 --> 04:57.297
YEAH.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.529
YOUR FIRST ACT AS MAYOR

04:58.529 --> 05:00.070
SHOULD BE CALMING DOWN
JELLY HULK.

05:00.070 --> 05:02.933
ARE YOU TIGHT WITH
THE ANIMAL CONTROL GUYS YET?

05:02.933 --> 05:04.475
I AM NOT GOING
ANYWHERE NEAR HER.

05:04.475 --> 05:06.437
OH, COME ON, MANDO.

05:06.437 --> 05:07.978
YOU'RE MARRIED TO ELLIE.

05:07.978 --> 05:10.381
YOU'RE A SEASONED CRAZY-BITCH
WHISPERER. NO OFFENSE.

05:10.381 --> 05:11.942
YOU KNOW, HE ONCE
BITCH WHISPERED ME DOWN

05:11.942 --> 05:14.945
FROM CHOKING OUT A LADY
FOR USING THE HANDICAPPED STALL.

05:14.945 --> 05:16.487
I MEAN, IT TURNS OUT
SHE WAS HANDICAPPED,

05:16.487 --> 05:19.720
BUT, LIKE, BARELY.

05:19.720 --> 05:24.324
OH, SOMETIMES I WISH
I COULD GET AWAY FROM IT ALL.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.656
TRAV,
YOU EVER GET OVERWHELMED

05:25.656 --> 05:27.728
BY THE STRESSES
OF DAY-TO-DAY LIFE?

05:27.728 --> 05:30.461
WELL, SURE.
BUT I GO TO COLLEGE,

05:30.461 --> 05:31.932
GET UP BEFORE NOON,

05:31.932 --> 05:34.004
BATHE.

05:34.004 --> 05:35.566
MAN, BATHING'S THE WORST.

05:35.566 --> 05:37.838
GET WET, DRY OFF,
GET WET, DRY OFF.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.740
IT'S A GRIND.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.613
I'M GONNA TAKE
A LITTLE VACAY.

05:42.613 --> 05:44.845
I'M IN.
WHERE ARE WE GOIN'?

05:46.777 --> 05:48.348
(door clatters)

05:48.348 --> 05:49.950
TARGET?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

05:49.950 --> 05:52.022
THIS IS A MAGICAL PLACE,
BUDDY.

05:52.022 --> 05:53.684
HEY, WELCOME BACK,
MR. COBB.

05:53.684 --> 05:56.487
YOU MUST BE TRAVIS.

05:56.487 --> 05:59.129
HOW'S YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY GOING?

05:59.129 --> 06:02.092
THIS IS WEIRD.

06:02.092 --> 06:05.466
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SHOWED THEM THE VIDEO.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.867
YOU NEVER SAID
IT WAS A SECRET.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.539
OH, COME ON.

06:08.539 --> 06:10.140
YOU KNOW WHEN STUFF SHOULD
STAY BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.

06:10.140 --> 06:12.142
I MEAN, THAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO GO IN THE VAULT.

06:12.142 --> 06:14.845
HMM?
THE VAULT, LIKE "SEINFELD"?

06:14.845 --> 06:18.078
NOT EVERYONE HAS HEARD
OF THAT SHOW.
THEY HAVE.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.610
WE ARE AN OPEN GROUP.

06:19.610 --> 06:21.051
WE TELL EACH OTHER
EVERYTHING.

06:21.051 --> 06:23.784
WE DON'T HAVE ANY VAULTS.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.916
ARE YOU SURE?

06:25.916 --> 06:28.789
HECK, YEAH, J-BIRD.
I GOT VAULTS.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.692
OF COURSE I DO, JULES.
(chuckles)

06:33.424 --> 06:35.065
EVERYONE DOES.

06:35.065 --> 06:38.829
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST ASK ME
THE FIRST TIME YOU CALLED?

06:38.829 --> 06:40.130
DO YOU HAVE VAULTS?

06:40.130 --> 06:41.872
I MEAN,
ARE THERE REALLY THINGS

06:41.872 --> 06:44.505
THAT YOU TELL OTHER PEOPLE
THAT YOU DON'T TELL ME?

06:44.505 --> 06:47.177
(sighs) YES.

06:47.177 --> 06:49.179
COOL.
COOL?

06:49.179 --> 06:50.841
HEY, LAURIE.

06:50.841 --> 06:52.613
ELLIE SAID THAT SHE'S HAPPY

06:52.613 --> 06:55.415
THAT TRAV'S BEEN PLAYING
THE FIELD. (chuckles)

06:55.415 --> 06:56.887
SIC HER.

06:56.887 --> 06:58.088
(growls)
AAH!

06:58.088 --> 07:01.421
I'M GONNA GET YOU. AAH!

07:01.421 --> 07:03.494
(Ellie) GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.
(Laurie) NO!

07:03.494 --> 07:05.526
DO YOU SEE
THIS FRYING PAN?

07:05.526 --> 07:07.628
I WILL HIT YOU WITH IT.
I'M GONNA DO IT!
TRY IT!

07:07.628 --> 07:09.800
(pan clanks, body thuds)

07:09.800 --> 07:11.702
(keypad beeping)

07:11.702 --> 07:14.865
ANDY, YOU GOTTA COME HOME.
IT FINALLY HAPPENED.

07:14.865 --> 07:16.967
WHERE ARE OUR PASSPORTS?
(Laurie groans)

07:16.967 --> 07:19.570
OH, FORGET IT.
SHE'S WAKING UP, THANK GOD.

07:19.570 --> 07:23.213
LAURIE, HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
(weakly) WHAT HAPPENED?

07:26.547 --> 07:27.878
ALL RIGHT.

07:27.878 --> 07:29.179
YOU WANT TO KNOW
EVERYONE'S VAULTS?

07:29.179 --> 07:30.681
THERE THEY ARE.

07:30.681 --> 07:32.823
YOU HAVE A VAULT WITH ANDY?

07:32.823 --> 07:34.154
OF COURSE.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.156
IS THERE ANYTHING
IN THAT VAULT ABOUT ME?

07:36.156 --> 07:37.588
THERE MAY BE.

07:37.588 --> 07:39.690
OPEN THE DAMN VAULT.

07:39.690 --> 07:40.891
DON'T DO IT, ELLIE.

07:40.891 --> 07:42.563
W-WHY DO YOU CARE?

07:42.563 --> 07:44.134
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TWO
HAVE A SECRET TOGETHER.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.236
YOU DON'T HAVE A...

07:46.236 --> 07:49.169
WAIT A MINUTE. (gasps)

07:49.169 --> 07:50.841
OH, BOY.

07:50.841 --> 07:52.573
PLEASE.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.204
(inhales deeply) OH, NO.

07:54.204 --> 07:57.648
NO! (gasps)

07:58.809 --> 08:00.711
HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN GOING ON?

08:00.711 --> 08:02.482
I CAME OVER FOR COFFEE ONE DAY,
AND YOU WEREN'T HERE.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.854
IT JUST HAPPENED.

08:03.854 --> 08:05.756
I THINK I'M GONNA
THROW UP.

08:05.756 --> 08:07.888
WELL, AT LEAST THIS HASN'T
GONE TO A CRAZY PLACE.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.520
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:09.520 --> 08:13.123
I'M GONNA BLOW UP
THIS WHOLE VAULT THING.

08:13.123 --> 08:14.625
THERE'S NO DRESSING LEFT.

08:14.625 --> 08:15.896
NEWMAN!

08:15.896 --> 08:17.728
(Grayson and Ellie laugh)

08:17.728 --> 08:19.499
WHAT?

08:19.499 --> 08:22.102
NOTHING.
YEAH, IT'S... (laughs)
FORGET IT.

08:23.934 --> 08:25.806
(imitates pirate voice)
I LOST ME WALLET PILLAGING.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.207
CAN I BORROW A DOUBLOON?

08:27.207 --> 08:28.609
(sighs)

08:28.609 --> 08:30.140
IF SOMEONE DOESN'T STOP HER,

08:30.140 --> 08:32.142
THIS TOWN'S GONNA BE FILLED
WITH ONE-EYED FREAKS.

08:34.645 --> 08:35.946
FINE.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.189
(singsongy) HEY, GIRL.

08:39.189 --> 08:40.921
(normal voice)
I KNOW YOU'RE FEELING

08:40.921 --> 08:42.753
ALL KINDS
OF BAD RIGHT NOW--

08:42.753 --> 08:44.895
ARE YOU BITCH WHISPERING ME?
WORKS ON ELLIE.

08:44.895 --> 08:47.057
YOU KNOW SHE HIT ME
WITH A FRYING PAN YESTERDAY?

08:47.057 --> 08:49.029
LUCKILY, I WORKED AT IHOP
IN TAMPA FOR SIX MONTHS,

08:49.029 --> 08:50.801
SO I KNEW HOW TO TAKE IT.

08:50.801 --> 08:52.703
COME TO
MY RIBBON-CUTTING CEREMONY.

08:52.703 --> 08:54.865
THE WHOLE GANG WILL BE THERE.
IT'LL TAKE YOUR MIND OFF IT.

08:54.865 --> 08:56.266
OKAY.

08:56.266 --> 08:58.208
в™Єв™Єв™Є

08:58.208 --> 09:02.813
OH, THIS IS GONNA MAKE
BRAIN SURGERY MUCH HARDER.

09:05.115 --> 09:08.819
DUDE, THIS PLACE... IS SICK.

09:08.819 --> 09:10.651
I WANT TO PLAY
ALL THE NEW VIDEO GAMES,

09:10.651 --> 09:12.152
THEN I WANT TO WATCH
WHATEVER PIXAR MOVIE'S PLAYING

09:12.152 --> 09:13.924
ON THOSE
70-INCH PLASMA SCREENS--

09:13.924 --> 09:18.088
WHOA, T-DOG.
WE GOT TIME. JUST CHILL.

09:21.291 --> 09:23.233
AHH.

09:23.233 --> 09:25.766
I FELL ASLEEP
IN ONE OF THESE EARLIER.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.337
I LOVE THIS PLACE.

09:27.337 --> 09:30.641
IT'S HOW I GET FAR, FAR AWAY
FROM ALL MY PROBLEMS.

09:30.641 --> 09:32.002
DITTO.

09:32.002 --> 09:34.574
TRAV, GET THE LADY A DRINK.

09:36.046 --> 09:38.709
OH, I THOUGHT
WE WERE DOING A BIT.

09:38.709 --> 09:40.580
(whistles)
(whistles)

09:43.183 --> 09:44.755
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU THINK

09:44.755 --> 09:45.956
THAT WE NEED TO KEEP THINGS
FROM EACH OTHER.

09:45.956 --> 09:47.217
I'M AN OPEN BOOK.

09:47.217 --> 09:48.919
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO LIVE IN A WORLD

09:48.919 --> 09:50.590
WHERE NONE OF US KEEP
ANYTHING FROM EACH OTHER,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.963
BUT FACE IT,
NO ONE AGREES WITH YOU.

09:52.963 --> 09:55.025
JULES, I AM SO PSYCHED
YOU CALLED.

09:55.025 --> 09:57.197
I'M SORRY I'M SO SWEATY.
I WAS AT PILATES.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.670
BUT WE CAN STILL HUG BECAUSE
I DID A DOUBLE DEOD COAT.

09:59.670 --> 10:00.901
OH. (laughs)
HA HA!

10:00.901 --> 10:03.133
OH.
IT'S KIND OF WORKING.

10:03.133 --> 10:05.305
I WILL HAVE A GIN AND TONIC
IN A BEER MUG, PLEASE.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.037
A BIG ONE.

10:07.037 --> 10:09.079
SO WHAT ARE THE PLANS,
AND DO I NEED TO DRIVE ANYWHERE?

10:09.079 --> 10:11.682
BECAUSE IF I DO,
I'M GONNA STOP AT THREE.

10:11.682 --> 10:13.213
I THOUGHT
WE WOULD JUST CHILL

10:13.213 --> 10:14.915
AND TALK ABOUT HOW YOU SHOULD
ALWAYS BE OPEN

10:14.915 --> 10:16.687
WITH THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU'RE CLOSEST WITH.

10:16.687 --> 10:18.288
YOU KNOW, ANY THOUGHTS?

10:18.288 --> 10:19.950
DID YOU CALL ME DOWN HERE
AS A THERAPIST

10:19.950 --> 10:21.992
OR AS A NEW GAL PAL?

10:21.992 --> 10:24.755
GAL PAL. DON'T BE RIDIC.

10:24.755 --> 10:25.996
YEAH. (laughs) OKAY.
GOT IT.

10:25.996 --> 10:27.627
WELL, THIS DEODORANT
IS JUST NOT WORKING.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.199
IT'S THE ORGANIC KIND,
AND BOO TO THAT, RIGHT?

10:29.199 --> 10:31.231
I'M GONNA GO SOP THIS UP
WITH SOMETHING.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.003
NAPKINS OR SOMETHING.

10:33.003 --> 10:35.966
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOUR WEIRD
SWEATY GAL PAL FINDS OUT

10:35.966 --> 10:38.268
YOU'RE JUST USING HER
TO WIN AN ARGUMENT,

10:38.268 --> 10:40.110
SHE'S GONNA FREAK.

10:40.110 --> 10:42.012
(lowered voice)
YOU CAN'T TELL HER

10:42.012 --> 10:44.214
BECAUSE WE'RE INSIDE THE VAULT.
BUT YOU DON'T LIKE VAULTS.

10:44.214 --> 10:46.646
WELL, UNTIL THEY'RE GONE,
I'M GONNA USE THEM.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.750
WHEW. THAT TABLE'S GONNA NEED
SOME MORE NAPKINS.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.281
SO, GRAYSON, REAL QUICK.

10:51.281 --> 10:52.953
WANT TO LET YOU KNOW
YOU HAVE THE SAME FRAME

10:52.953 --> 10:54.755
AS MY DEAD GAY HUSBAND.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.656
IF YOU EVER NEED A PAIR
OF ASS-LESS JEANS,

10:56.656 --> 10:58.158
LET ME KNOW.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.430
THIS IS GONNA SOUND WEIRD,
BUT I WOULD LIKE THOSE.

11:00.430 --> 11:01.832
MM.

11:01.832 --> 11:03.063
MM.

11:03.063 --> 11:06.036
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.
IT'S 2:00.

11:06.036 --> 11:08.899
(sighs) I CAN'T BELIEVE
NO ONE SHOWED,

11:08.899 --> 11:10.941
NOT EVEN MY WIFE

11:10.941 --> 11:13.173
OR MY BEST FRIEND.

11:14.945 --> 11:18.048
(loudly) AS MY FIRST OFFICIAL
ACT AS MAYOR,

11:18.048 --> 11:23.714
I PRESENT GULFHAVEN'S
NEW BIKE RACK.

11:23.714 --> 11:25.185
THANK YOU.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.887
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.289
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.792
COME ON!

11:31.792 --> 11:33.263
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE

11:33.263 --> 11:34.795
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BRAND
OF TOILET PAPER--

11:34.795 --> 11:35.996
HEY, DAD.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.427
CAN I BORROW YOU
FOR A SEC?

11:37.427 --> 11:39.699
(lowered voice)
WHAT'S UP?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.332
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT
WAS GOING ANYWHERE GOOD.

11:42.332 --> 11:44.174
(normal voice)
I'M JUST NERVOUS.

11:44.174 --> 11:46.006
YOU KNOW, MY STOMACH FEELS
LIKE IT'S FULL OF BUTTERFLIES.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.178
SERIOUSLY, IT FEELS EXACTLY
HOW IT DID

11:48.178 --> 11:49.479
WHEN I ATE
ALL THOSE BUTTERFLIES.

11:49.479 --> 11:51.842
THAT WAS A BET
I'M SAD I WON.

11:51.842 --> 11:53.413
SO HOW CAN I CONNECT
WITH THIS GAL?

11:53.413 --> 11:54.815
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.947
JUST WALK DOWN AN AISLE

11:56.947 --> 11:59.890
AND SEE WHERE IT TAKES YOU.

11:59.890 --> 12:03.053
(Joshua Radin's
"The Greenest Grass" playing)

12:03.053 --> 12:04.955
в™Є TIME в™Є

12:04.955 --> 12:06.456
в™Є STOPPED в™Є

12:06.456 --> 12:09.299
в™Є WHEN I SAW YOU в™Є

12:09.299 --> 12:13.233
в™Є I COULD BARELY BREATHE в™Є

12:13.233 --> 12:15.235
в™Є AND DAY BROKE в™Є

12:15.235 --> 12:19.209
в™Є WHEN THE SUN ROSE в™Є

12:19.209 --> 12:23.113
в™Є LIGHTING UP YOUR FACE в™Є

12:23.113 --> 12:28.018
в™Є I AM A LUCKY MAN в™Є

12:28.018 --> 12:32.853
в™Є TO RECOGNIZE YOUR GRACE в™Є

12:32.853 --> 12:36.326
в™Є WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING
NEXT TO YOU в™Є

12:36.326 --> 12:41.361
в™Є I SAID, "BABY,
THIS MUST BE THE PLACE" в™Є

12:41.361 --> 12:43.163
в™Є THEN YOU SAID в™Є

12:43.163 --> 12:49.269
в™Є "I KNOW I'LL NEVER FIND
ANOTHER LIKE YOU в™Є

12:49.269 --> 12:52.242
в™Є WHERE I'M GOING" в™Є

12:54.074 --> 12:59.349
в™Є "YOU'RE
THE GREENEST GRASS GROWING" в™Є

12:59.349 --> 13:03.013
в™Є I SAID, "NOW I KNOW в™Є

13:03.013 --> 13:07.557
в™Є I'LL NEVER FIND
ANOTHER LIKE YOU" в™Є

13:10.120 --> 13:13.924
SO, GAL PAL, BACK ME UP ON
THIS WHOLE "NO VAULTS" THING.

13:13.924 --> 13:15.195
I MEAN, I KNOW
YOU LIKE BEING OPEN

13:15.195 --> 13:16.426
FROM THAT STORY YOU TOLD ME

13:16.426 --> 13:18.098
ABOUT BEING
A HUMAN SUSHI PLATTER.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.000
YOU KNOW, JULES, I THINK
VAULTS ARE IMPORTANT.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.432
OH. WHAT ARE YOU ALL
SO SCARED OF?

13:22.432 --> 13:24.404
I MEAN, IS IT THAT BAD

13:24.404 --> 13:27.307
THAT WE KNOW THAT YOU WERE IN
AN ALANIS MORISSETTE VIDEO?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.840
AND, ELLIE, I THINK
THAT YOU WOULD FEEL BETTER

13:29.840 --> 13:32.282
IF EVERYONE KNEW THAT YOU WERE
BORN WITH 11 TOES.

13:32.282 --> 13:33.884
LIAR. THAT'S NOT TRUE.

13:33.884 --> 13:35.545
N--IT'S ACTUALLY
VERY COMMON.

13:35.545 --> 13:39.119
SHE HAD THE RARE
7-4 SPLIT. (laughs)

13:39.119 --> 13:40.320
TOO MANY.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.092
NOT ENOUGH.

13:42.092 --> 13:44.024
WHEN YOU LEARNED TO WALK,
DID YOU JUST GO IN CIRCLES?

13:44.024 --> 13:45.425
(Grayson and Jules laugh)

13:45.425 --> 13:47.427
NOW DIME EYES IS MOCKING ME.
ARE YOU HAPPY?

13:47.427 --> 13:49.930
WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE DO,
HONEY. WE RIB EACH OTHER.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.361
WE'RE FINE, RIGHT?

13:51.361 --> 13:53.163
TOTALLY FINE.

13:53.163 --> 13:54.534
I'M JUST NEVER GONNA TELL YOU
ANYTHING EVER AGAIN.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.206
GRAYSON.

13:56.206 --> 13:58.939
SINCE THERE AREN'T
ANY VAULTS,

13:58.939 --> 14:00.470
JULES DIDN'T REALLY
WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

14:00.470 --> 14:04.174
SHE JUST WANTED YOU TO TELL HER
THAT SHE WAS RIGHT.

14:04.174 --> 14:05.916
IS THAT TRUE?

14:05.916 --> 14:08.078
I'M SORRY.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.321
WELL, THEY'RE FIXED NOW.

14:11.321 --> 14:13.523
I-I...

14:17.287 --> 14:19.459
OH, HEY, HONEY.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.462
OH, HEY, ELLIE.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.894
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

14:23.894 --> 14:25.195
I'VE BEEN
WAITING TEN MINUTES

14:25.195 --> 14:27.938
FOR YOU TO LOOK OVER
SO I COULD DO THIS.

14:27.938 --> 14:29.369
SERIOUSLY?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.571
YOU HURT HER, JULES.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.303
(voice breaks)
YOU HURT ALL OF US.

14:33.303 --> 14:35.245
HEY, LYNN, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE STILL HERE

14:35.245 --> 14:39.079
AND THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
ENOUGH TO BE WEARING MY PAJAMAS.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.011
I NEEDED TO REGROUP.

14:41.011 --> 14:42.652
CAN YOU HELP ME FIX THIS?

14:44.084 --> 14:46.516
I JUST FEEL SO HURT,
SO USED.

14:46.516 --> 14:48.989
I JUST FEEL SO EMPTY.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.061
I UNDERSTAND.

14:51.061 --> 14:53.563
(clenched teeth) BUT WHY DO WE
HAVE TO DO THIS IN FRONT OF HIM?

14:53.563 --> 14:55.926
OH, RON? THAT'S 'CAUSE
HE'S A GREAT SHRINK.

14:55.926 --> 14:58.068
I'VE BEEN SEEING HIM
FOR YEARS.

14:58.068 --> 14:59.329
(whispers) SHE'S NUTS.
WHAT?

14:59.329 --> 15:00.630
(whispers) I KNOW.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.332
(normal voice) OKAY,
I'M COOL WITH RON.

15:02.332 --> 15:04.504
YAY.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.436
I CAN'T BELIEVE
NO ONE SHOWED.

15:06.436 --> 15:08.508
YEAH, I'M STILL
REALLY BUMMED, TOO.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.080
(gasps)

15:10.080 --> 15:12.943
LET'S GO FIGHT CLUB
ON EACH OTHER.

15:12.943 --> 15:14.314
YOU'D BE SURPRISED

15:14.314 --> 15:16.086
WHAT A BITCH SLAP
CAN MAKE YOU FORGET.

15:16.086 --> 15:17.447
THAT'S INSANE.

15:17.447 --> 15:19.589
HEY!

15:19.589 --> 15:21.091
FIGHT ME. I WANT TO.

15:21.091 --> 15:22.422
I'M NOT GONNA HIT
A GIRL.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.623
(grunts)

15:23.623 --> 15:25.025
(grunts) OW! STOP IT!

15:25.025 --> 15:26.396
COME AT ME, BITCH!

15:26.396 --> 15:27.597
I SAID STOP!

15:27.597 --> 15:28.999
AAH!
(thud)

15:28.999 --> 15:30.330
OH, MY GOD. I AM SO SORRY.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.203
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT WAS AWESOME.
OH!

15:33.203 --> 15:35.005
(punches landing)
IS THE MAYOR
BEATING UP A WOMAN?

15:35.005 --> 15:37.237
EYE FOR AN EYE, ANDY!
FINISH HER!

15:37.237 --> 15:38.668
(Andy) AAH! OH!

15:38.668 --> 15:40.340
LYNN, SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT

15:40.340 --> 15:43.213
HOW INAPPROPRIATE IT WAS
FOR YOU TO INSERT YOURSELF

15:43.213 --> 15:46.276
INTO YOUR PATIENT'S
PERSONAL LIFE?

15:46.276 --> 15:48.318
NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.

15:48.318 --> 15:50.120
LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.321
I USED YOU.

15:51.321 --> 15:52.652
I WAS A JERK
AND I REGRET IT.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.324
YADA, YADA, YADA.

15:54.324 --> 15:56.256
I LOVE THAT EPISODE.
(laughs)

15:56.256 --> 15:59.959
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
"SEINFELD, I WILL KILL YOU.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.092
I WOULD BE WILLING
TO FORGET ABOUT ALL THIS

16:02.092 --> 16:05.095
IF YOU AGREE TO COME TO
PILATES WITH ME ONCE A WEEK.
OH.

16:05.095 --> 16:06.666
NOT A HEALTHY SOLUTION.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.669
NO ONE ASKED YOU, RON.
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHY

16:09.669 --> 16:12.302
THIS WHOLE VAULT THING
IS MAKING ME SO NUTS.

16:12.302 --> 16:15.475
I THINK YOU'VE GOT SOME
DEEP-SEATED TRUST ISSUES.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.177
(imitates buzzer)
YOUR TURN, RONNIE.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.608
I WAS GONNA SAY
WHAT SHE SAID.

16:18.608 --> 16:20.310
NO, HE WASN'T.
HE'S TOTALLY

16:20.310 --> 16:22.182
THE "TELL ME WHY YOU FEEL
THE WAY YOU FEEL" TYPE.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.713
OH, I HATE THAT TYPE.

16:23.713 --> 16:25.315
WHY DO YOU HATE THAT, JULES?

16:25.315 --> 16:27.217
TH-THIS GUY, RIGHT?
SERIOUSLY? DUDE. COME ON.

16:27.217 --> 16:30.060
W-WHEN I WAS A KID,
MY MOM WAS SICK,

16:30.060 --> 16:33.393
AND NO ONE TOLD ME BECAUSE
THEY KNEW I WOULD GET UPSET.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.625
AND THEN...

16:35.625 --> 16:37.167
DURING MY FIRST MARRIAGE,

16:37.167 --> 16:38.998
EVERYONE KNEW THAT I WAS
BEING CHEATED ON,

16:38.998 --> 16:40.530
BUT NO ONE SAID ANYTHING.

16:40.530 --> 16:44.404
SO I GUESS, I JUST--
I HATE BEING KEPT IN THE DARK.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.005
GOSH, YOU'RE MISSING OUT.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.337
I MEAN, I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW SAFE IT FEELS

16:47.337 --> 16:49.109
TO BE ABLE
TO TELL SOMEONE ANYTHING

16:49.109 --> 16:51.181
AND KNOW THAT IT'S NOT GONNA
COME BACK TO BITE YOU.

16:51.181 --> 16:54.714
I MEAN, THAT IS PROBABLY WHY
YOU LIKE THERAPY SO MUCH.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.786
THANKS, LYNN.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.790
RON, WE GOT--WE HAVE
A FEW MINUTES LEFT HERE.
(door opens)

17:00.790 --> 17:03.053
IF I WERE TREATING SOMEONE...

17:03.053 --> 17:05.155
(door closes)
AND I WAS HAVING FANTASIES
ABOUT RUNNING MY FINGERS

17:05.155 --> 17:07.157
THROUGH HER DARK,
LICORICE HAIR,

17:07.157 --> 17:10.800
WOULD IT BE UNPROFESSIONAL FOR
ME TO CONTINUE TREATING HER?

17:10.800 --> 17:14.804
YES.
MM. DISAPPOINTED.

17:14.804 --> 17:16.536
(sniffles)

17:16.536 --> 17:18.238
MAN, I HAVEN'T HAD
A BLOODY NOSE SINCE...

17:18.238 --> 17:19.609
EVERY DAY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

17:19.609 --> 17:21.371
DUDE, YOU'RE REALLY TOUGH.

17:21.371 --> 17:23.273
BUT I STILL CAN'T HEAR
OUT OF THIS EAR.

17:23.273 --> 17:25.245
YOU HAVE
REALLY STRONG THIGHS.

17:25.245 --> 17:28.318
I ONCE SHATTERED A MAN'S
CHEEKBONES WITH MY THIGHS.

17:28.318 --> 17:29.719
WHAT WERE YOU
FIGHTING ABOUT?

17:29.719 --> 17:31.121
NO, NO, NO,
WE WEREN'T FIGHTING.

17:31.121 --> 17:32.622
OH, OKAY.
YEAH.

17:32.622 --> 17:34.354
WE'RE SO DUMB.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.785
I ACTED LIKE THE MAYOR THING
WASN'T IMPORTANT TO ME,

17:35.785 --> 17:37.327
AND OF COURSE
NO ONE SHOWED UP.

17:37.327 --> 17:38.658
AND YOU'RE SO MAD AT TRAV.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.091
DOES HE EVEN KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM?

17:41.091 --> 17:42.632
NO.

17:42.632 --> 17:44.334
IT'S NOT FAIR TO ACT LIKE
PEOPLE LET YOU DOWN

17:44.334 --> 17:46.436
IF YOU NEVER TOLD 'EM
WHAT YOU WANTED.

17:46.436 --> 17:48.268
(clicks tongue)

17:48.268 --> 17:49.469
(sighs)

17:49.469 --> 17:50.840
WHOA. DON'T GET UP SO FAST.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.572
I CLOCKED YOU IN THE HEAD
PRETTY HARD, DUDE.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.705
(St. Lucia's "All Eyes On You"
playing)

17:55.705 --> 17:57.747
(sighs)
WHAT AN AMAZING DAY.

17:57.747 --> 18:00.650
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

18:00.650 --> 18:02.812
в™Єв™Єв™Є

18:02.812 --> 18:05.715
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU,
BOBBY COBB.

18:05.715 --> 18:07.557
YOU, TOO, TARGET MARY.

18:07.557 --> 18:10.720
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE?
YOU TWO ARE GREAT TOGETHER.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.223
TRAV, THIS WAS A VACATION FLING.
THOSE END.

18:13.223 --> 18:14.864
OH, I GOTTA GET GOING.

18:14.864 --> 18:16.866
I GOTTA CATCH A CAB
TO THE AIRPORT.

18:16.866 --> 18:18.568
BYE.

18:18.568 --> 18:20.500
BYE.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.702
SHE LIVES BY THE AIRPORT.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.234
в™Є EVEN IN THE MEANTIME в™Є

18:24.234 --> 18:26.636
WE CAN'T HIDE
FROM THE REAL WORLD FOREVER,

18:26.636 --> 18:28.738
BUT WE CAN ALWAYS
COME BACK NEXT YEAR.

18:28.738 --> 18:31.641
WHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR?
WE WALKED HERE.

18:31.641 --> 18:33.583
SHH. JUST WAVE.

18:33.583 --> 18:35.315
в™Є IN THE DAYTIME в™Є

18:35.315 --> 18:38.248
в™Є CAN'T FESS UP TO YOU в™Є

18:38.248 --> 18:39.589
в™Є 'CAUSE I HOPE в™Є

18:39.589 --> 18:41.751
WELL, THERE HE IS!
(cheering)

18:41.751 --> 18:43.193
YOU GUYS.

18:43.193 --> 18:45.225
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, BOO.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.397
THANK YOU.
BOBBY, GIANT SCISSORS.

18:47.397 --> 18:50.630
DON'T RUN WITH THESE THINGS,
BUBBA. (laughs)

18:50.630 --> 18:52.702
MR. MAYOR,
WOULD YOU DO THE HONOR?

18:52.702 --> 18:54.234
OF COURSE.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.636
(cheering)

18:56.636 --> 18:58.168
NOW WE CELEBRATE!

18:58.168 --> 18:59.369
(pops)
AH!

18:59.369 --> 19:00.670
(laughs) YEAH.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.412
HE DIDN'T EVEN GET HER NUMBER.

19:02.412 --> 19:04.544
YOU KNOW, IT--
IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING

19:04.544 --> 19:06.546
TO SEE TWO PEOPLE
WHO'D BE SO GOOD TOGETHER

19:06.546 --> 19:08.618
NOT EVEN GIVE IT A SHOT.

19:08.618 --> 19:09.819
IT SUCKS, RIGHT?
YEAH, IT--

19:09.819 --> 19:11.451
YEAH, WELL...
(pats leg)

19:11.451 --> 19:13.753
(sighs)

19:13.753 --> 19:15.154
(sighs)

19:15.154 --> 19:17.457
(glasses clink)
THANK YOU.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.589
YOU TOLD 'EM I WAS UPSET,
DIDN'T YOU?

19:19.589 --> 19:20.790
(laughs) YEAH.

19:20.790 --> 19:22.792
BUT THE PARTY
WAS THEIR IDEA.

19:22.792 --> 19:25.665
THANKS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.197
WANT ME TO TELL TRAV?

19:27.197 --> 19:30.300
NO. NO.
I'M NOT READY YET.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.772
WHERE DID JULES
AND DIME EYES GO?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.344
SO I CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING--

19:34.344 --> 19:37.347
ANY FEAR, ANY INSECURITY,
EVEN WEIRD STUFF--

19:37.347 --> 19:39.679
AND IT JUST STAYS
IN OUR VAULT?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.581
RIGHT.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.754
I WAS AFRAID TO MARRY YOU
BECAUSE YOU'D BEEN DIVORCED.

19:44.754 --> 19:48.418
A LITTLE HYPOCRITICAL,
BUT LOCKED UP FOREVER.

19:48.418 --> 19:49.759
OOH. I LOVE THIS.

19:49.759 --> 19:51.721
(chuckles)

19:51.721 --> 19:54.494
I DON'T REALLY LIKE
YOUR DAUGHTER.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.796
WE DON'T HAVE TO, UH, FILL
THE WHOLE VAULT UP TONIGHT.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.369
(chuckles)
OH.

19:59.369 --> 20:00.930
WHEN I WAS 12,

20:00.930 --> 20:05.204
I PUT LIPSTICK UP MY BUTT
SO I'D POOP PRETTY.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.637
MY PARENTS HAD TO TAKE ME
TO THE HOSPITAL.

20:07.637 --> 20:11.441
THIS GOES IN
OUR NEW GROUP VAULT, OKAY?

20:11.441 --> 20:12.642
OH, YEAH.

20:12.642 --> 20:14.384
SOMETIMES WHEN WE HAVE SEX,

20:14.384 --> 20:16.946
I WISH THAT YOU WERE THE GIRL
AND I WAS THE BOY.

20:16.946 --> 20:19.419
OH, WE CAN DO THAT.
(whispers) OH!

20:19.419 --> 20:21.351
I'M GOING HOME.

20:21.351 --> 20:24.354
(whispers) OH, SO GOOD.

20:27.657 --> 20:28.858
I WAS WAITING
UNTIL WE WERE ALONE

20:28.858 --> 20:30.800
TO SHOW YOU THIS.
(clicks key)

20:30.800 --> 20:34.464
в™Є YOU'VE WASHED YOUR HANDS
CLEAN OF THIS в™Є

20:34.464 --> 20:36.406
I'M NOT IN THIS ONE.
(chuckles)

20:36.406 --> 20:38.308
NO, BUT I AM.

20:38.308 --> 20:39.509
WHAT?

20:39.509 --> 20:40.810
в™Є ...REINVENTED в™Є

20:40.810 --> 20:44.274
JEAN JACKET GUY,
MEET SMARMY RECORD EXEC.

20:44.274 --> 20:45.545
YOU'RE A MORISSETTE MAN, TOO?

20:45.545 --> 20:47.577
YEP.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.480

20:50.480 --> 20:51.851

20:51.851 --> 20:53.353
OH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.624
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

20:54.624 --> 20:56.025
(clears throat)
NOTHING. (chuckles)

20:56.025 --> 20:58.458
(music stops)

20:58.458 --> 20:59.659
VAULT?

20:59.659 --> 21:01.361
ABSOLUTELY.
(chuckles)
