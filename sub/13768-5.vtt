00:02.127 --> 00:04.254
Lois, are you about done

00:02.127 --> 00:04.254
in there?

00:02.127 --> 00:04.254
No!

00:04.296 --> 00:06.674
Well, you're gonna have

00:04.296 --> 00:06.674
to get out, I'm late for work.

00:06.715 --> 00:07.967
Hal, I am not cutting

00:06.715 --> 00:07.967
my shower short

00:08.008 --> 00:09.301
because you can't get

00:08.008 --> 00:09.301
out of bed in the morning!

00:09.343 --> 00:10.552
I can get up just fine

00:10.594 --> 00:13.054
if somebody didn't turn off

00:10.594 --> 00:13.054
my snooze alarm!

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
That alarm went off

00:13.096 --> 00:15.056
every six minutes for an hour!

00:15.098 --> 00:16.266
What are you doing?

00:16.308 --> 00:17.058
I'm getting in, Lois.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.101
You are not!

00:18.143 --> 00:20.061
You will get your shower

00:18.143 --> 00:20.061
when I'm finished!

00:25.024 --> 00:27.653
I don't think I'll be able

00:25.024 --> 00:27.653
to come in today.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.947
I've got a pretty severe fever,

00:29.989 --> 00:33.074
scratchy throat, cough.

No... no... no... wait.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.127
No, no...

01:26.169 --> 01:28.047
Hi, boys. Got a second?

01:29.172 --> 01:31.132
You boys really have

01:29.172 --> 01:31.132
a pretty good life.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.133
Uh-oh.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.053
Spend your days flying kites,

01:34.093 --> 01:35.303
playing video games.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.138
It's about time you

01:35.345 --> 01:37.138
found something to do

01:37.180 --> 01:38.139
to enrich your lives.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.140
When did we have kites?

01:39.182 --> 01:40.350
I could never

01:39.182 --> 01:40.350
live with myself

01:40.392 --> 01:42.853
if my boys grew up to be

01:40.392 --> 01:42.853
selfish little pigs,

01:42.895 --> 01:44.646
so I decided

01:42.895 --> 01:44.646
to volunteer you

01:44.688 --> 01:46.356
to do a little

01:44.688 --> 01:46.356
charity work.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.025
You can choose between

01:48.067 --> 01:51.445
helping old people

01:48.067 --> 01:51.445
or helping poor people.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.573
Or I can make you do both.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.157
Okay, old people.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.159
What can be hard

01:56.199 --> 01:58.159
about old people?

01:59.578 --> 02:01.455
Poor people--

01:59.578 --> 02:01.455
we want poor people.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.087
Hi.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.254
I'm Francis.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.131
Mr. Price said I should see you.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.175
Whoo!

02:14.217 --> 02:17.429
I can't believe

02:14.217 --> 02:17.429
how cold it is up here.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.473
Of course, it is Alaska,

02:19.514 --> 02:21.058
but still you'd think

02:19.514 --> 02:21.058
they could

02:21.100 --> 02:23.602
dome the place or put tunnels

02:21.100 --> 02:23.602
in between the buildings.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.772
So you must know

02:24.812 --> 02:26.772
my buddy Eric Hansen?

02:26.814 --> 02:29.190
He's the one who set up

02:26.814 --> 02:29.190
the logging job for me.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.194
Do you give out the axes?

02:33.236 --> 02:35.530
'Cause I'm a lefty,

02:33.236 --> 02:35.530
if that makes any difference.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.241
What's that?

02:38.283 --> 02:39.994
It's a broom, genius.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.454
Now grab an apron,

02:40.035 --> 02:42.454
sweep out my pantry

02:42.496 --> 02:44.498
and quit staring at my bosom.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.207
No, you don't understand.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.710
Um, I came up here

02:46.249 --> 02:48.710
to work as a logger.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.379
Let me tell you a little

02:48.752 --> 02:51.379
something about loggers.

02:51.421 --> 02:55.509
They're filthy,

02:51.421 --> 02:55.509
drunken, lowlife swine,

02:55.550 --> 02:57.845
and you are their slave.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.388
You will feed them,

02:57.886 --> 03:00.388
do their laundry,

03:00.430 --> 03:02.099
and clean out their privies.

03:02.141 --> 03:04.018
You don't steal,

03:02.141 --> 03:04.018
you don't back-talk

03:04.059 --> 03:06.227
and you don't socialize

03:04.059 --> 03:06.227
with the Eskimos.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.228
Okay...

03:07.270 --> 03:09.188
What'd I say about back-talk?!

03:17.865 --> 03:19.407
Eric?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.493
Francis?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.037
Hey, what's going on?

03:23.078 --> 03:23.620
I thought you said...

03:23.662 --> 03:25.914
(sobbing)

03:28.125 --> 03:30.209
I don't hear sweeping!

03:34.006 --> 03:36.842
You boys should be

03:34.006 --> 03:36.842
so proud of yourselves.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.720
A lot of people are really going

03:36.884 --> 03:39.720
to appreciate what you're doing.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.931
You know, I'm going to say

03:39.761 --> 03:42.931
a special prayer for you.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.893
Yeah, that should

03:42.973 --> 03:45.893
make us even.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.937
Why are we organizing trash?

03:48.979 --> 03:51.356
It's not trash, it's stuff

03:48.979 --> 03:51.356
that was donated to the poor.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.775
Look, Reese,

03:51.398 --> 03:53.775
it's just like yours.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.861
Yeah, except it's nicer.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.237
It doesn't have holes in it.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.200
Yeah, well, this jacket

03:59.156 --> 04:01.200
is better than yours.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.536
You're right.

04:07.122 --> 04:10.167
Everything in here is

04:07.122 --> 04:10.167
better than our stuff.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.254
Ha, ha, you're poor.

04:17.925 --> 04:21.261
No wonder I never got

04:17.925 --> 04:21.261
a rocket sled.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.766
What are you doing?

04:23.972 --> 04:25.766
Trading.

04:25.807 --> 04:26.725
I'm not sure if

04:25.807 --> 04:26.725
you're allow...

04:26.767 --> 04:28.018
Think of it this way--

04:28.060 --> 04:29.310
I'm making a donation.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.563
Instead of one poor person

04:29.352 --> 04:31.563
getting a new shirt,

04:31.605 --> 04:33.107
now two poor people get one.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.274
What's wrong with that?

04:38.737 --> 04:40.321
I can't move.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.324
Ten hours of scouring

04:40.363 --> 04:43.324
deep fat fryers

04:43.366 --> 04:46.494
with a 20-minute break

04:43.366 --> 04:46.494
to detick sled dogs?

04:46.536 --> 04:48.329
What's wrong

04:46.536 --> 04:48.329
with that woman?

04:48.371 --> 04:49.581
Her name's Lavernia.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.333
She controls every facet

04:49.623 --> 04:52.333
of your life up here.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.334
She finds out

04:53.376 --> 04:54.253
what your weakness is

04:54.294 --> 04:55.796
and then she gets

04:54.294 --> 04:55.796
inside your head

04:55.837 --> 04:56.797
and starts working it

04:56.838 --> 05:00.341
until she makes you

04:56.838 --> 05:00.341
hate yourself.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.509
Women.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.763
They're just like the woods--

05:01.551 --> 05:04.763
mysterious.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.182
Full of wolves.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.350
Whoa, Eric,

05:07.224 --> 05:09.350
pull it together, man.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.936
Could be a lot worse.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.771
I mean, at least we're

05:10.978 --> 05:12.771
making good money, right?

05:12.813 --> 05:14.064
No, we're not.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.191
Did you see

05:14.106 --> 05:16.191
that ledger book of hers?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.859
She charges us for everything

05:17.901 --> 05:18.986
and deducts it

05:17.901 --> 05:18.986
from our pay.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.196
Food, rent, aprons.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.239
Hair gel.

05:22.281 --> 05:24.992
My first check

05:22.281 --> 05:24.992
was for six dollars.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.745
Great.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.745
Generator's out again.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.371
So what are

05:28.787 --> 05:30.371
we supposed to do?

05:30.413 --> 05:32.291
Just sit around here

05:30.413 --> 05:32.291
in the dark?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.374
No, this isn't dark.

05:34.251 --> 05:35.543
You ever spent the night

05:35.585 --> 05:37.587
in a caribou's gut?

05:37.629 --> 05:39.965
Who is this old coot?

05:40.007 --> 05:43.844
He's my best friend here.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.395
It's so nice of your boys

05:51.935 --> 05:54.395
to help us out like this.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.981
We've always loved

05:54.437 --> 05:55.981
this old church.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.607
If you cut through

05:56.023 --> 05:57.607
the parking lot,

05:57.649 --> 05:59.818
you can bypass that

05:57.649 --> 05:59.818
traffic light on Sixth.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.861
Well...

06:00.902 --> 06:03.155
Keep up the good work, boys.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.034
All right, I'll be back

06:05.448 --> 06:07.034
in two hours,

06:07.075 --> 06:08.910
during which time

06:07.075 --> 06:08.910
I suggest

06:08.952 --> 06:11.121
you think about

06:08.952 --> 06:11.121
the horrible...

06:11.163 --> 06:12.998
thoughtless...

06:13.040 --> 06:16.126
whatever it is you did

06:13.040 --> 06:16.126
to deserve this punishment.

06:16.168 --> 06:18.419
That's just it--

06:16.168 --> 06:18.419
we didn't do anything.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.255
Mom said we needed

06:18.461 --> 06:20.255
to build character.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.423
Your character, right?

06:23.675 --> 06:27.386
Well, see that you do.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.269
What are you doing?

06:34.311 --> 06:35.436
Trading again--

06:35.478 --> 06:36.646
a backpack

06:35.478 --> 06:36.646
for a backpack.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.649
Dewey, wait.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.943
A yo-yo isn't equal

06:39.691 --> 06:41.943
to a Game Boy.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.196
What if I throw in

06:41.985 --> 06:44.196
my Mighty Man?

06:45.989 --> 06:48.033
Okay, two toys for one--

06:45.989 --> 06:48.033
seems fair.

06:48.075 --> 06:51.286
Yeah, I mean, just as long

06:48.075 --> 06:51.286
as what we trade is equal,

06:51.328 --> 06:52.913
it seems like...

06:52.954 --> 06:54.998
Whoa, check these out.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.377
Is this fair?

06:58.417 --> 06:59.753
Think of it this way--

06:59.794 --> 07:02.923
when you add in the value

06:59.794 --> 07:02.923
of the work we're doing,

07:02.964 --> 07:04.465
they're still way ahead.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.897
Where do you want me

07:16.937 --> 07:18.897
to dump this?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.565
You don't dump it.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.860
You take that bucket,

07:20.607 --> 07:23.860
heat it up to 190 degrees,

07:23.902 --> 07:26.863
pour it through the hair trap,

07:23.902 --> 07:26.863
and make gravy for dinner.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.408
You're going to reuse

07:26.905 --> 07:29.408
old, filthy fat?

07:29.449 --> 07:32.160
You like having a job?!

07:33.828 --> 07:35.163
Hey, Lavernia.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.291
I need some licorice,

07:35.205 --> 07:37.291
some paper towels

07:37.332 --> 07:38.417
and a six-pack of beer.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.126
Sure, hon.

07:40.710 --> 07:41.878
Oh, no.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.004
it took me six months

07:43.046 --> 07:44.505
to get you paid off last time.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.507
I'm off of that book of yours

07:44.547 --> 07:46.507
for good.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.343
Hard cash.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.553
I got it counted out exactly.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.513
Good enough.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.682
Would you like

07:52.555 --> 07:54.682
a freshly-baked muffin?

07:54.724 --> 07:56.310
Only eight bucks.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.894
You got to be kidding me.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.188
Eight bucks for a little...

08:00.230 --> 08:01.564
Are those raisins?

08:01.606 --> 08:03.024
Last ones till spring.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.738
Oh!

08:13.076 --> 08:13.910
Quit staring at my caboose!

08:13.952 --> 08:15.454
Get back to work!

08:15.495 --> 08:18.039
Hey, you know what, you don't

08:15.495 --> 08:18.039
have to snarl at us every...

08:26.423 --> 08:28.133
God, high school is brutal.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.550
They don't care

08:28.175 --> 08:29.550
how much homework

08:29.592 --> 08:30.551
you have in other classes.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.179
They just keep heaping it on.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.555
Is Monday okay?

08:34.597 --> 08:36.557
Make it Friday-- I

08:34.597 --> 08:36.557
don't want to ruin your weekend.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.642
Oh, no.

08:37.684 --> 08:40.354
I lost the crystal

08:37.684 --> 08:40.354
off my watch.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.562
Didn't your parents

08:40.395 --> 08:41.562
give you that?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.605
Yeah.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.564
I saw watches like this

08:43.606 --> 08:44.565
down at the church.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.733
Really? Can you get it for me?

08:45.775 --> 08:47.277
Sure-- as long as

08:45.775 --> 08:47.277
you donate

08:47.319 --> 08:49.029
something of equal

08:47.319 --> 08:49.029
or greater value.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.490
Okay, how about this aftershave?

08:51.531 --> 08:52.740
My mom got it for me

08:52.782 --> 08:54.575
for parties and dances.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.744
Poor, deluded woman.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.744
Sold.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.579
You wouldn't believe all the

08:56.786 --> 08:58.579
stuff they've got down there.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.748
Clothes, toys, comics.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.959
Yesterday, a guy dropped

09:00.790 --> 09:02.959
off an old Nintendo

09:03.001 --> 09:04.585
with a Double Dragon Four game.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.962
DD4?

09:06.004 --> 09:08.298
The Sacred... Stone?

09:08.340 --> 09:09.383
Yeah, why?

09:09.424 --> 09:11.218
I'll give you $20 for it.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.596
Money?

09:15.638 --> 09:18.225
I guess we could put it

09:15.638 --> 09:18.225
in the collection box.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.018
This is great.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.603
The church is only charging

09:20.060 --> 09:22.603
five bucks for it.

09:22.645 --> 09:23.604
This way we pick it up,

09:23.646 --> 09:25.065
Stevie gets

09:23.646 --> 09:25.065
the game he wants,

09:25.106 --> 09:27.401
and the church gets

09:25.106 --> 09:27.401
an extra ten-buck donation.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.903
No, the church would get

09:27.442 --> 09:29.903
an extra 15 bucks.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.697
Well, I think we deserve

09:29.944 --> 09:32.697
something for our trouble.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.115
Think of it this way--

09:34.157 --> 09:36.617
the church is getting

09:34.157 --> 09:36.617
three times the money

09:36.659 --> 09:38.203
they would otherwise.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.871
Yeah, we're making

09:38.245 --> 09:39.871
this work for everyone.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.457
Any porcelain tea sets?

09:42.499 --> 09:44.709
Not for me, of course--

09:42.499 --> 09:44.709
for my sister.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.503
Isn't your sister at Vassar?

09:46.545 --> 09:48.588
Look, do you want

09:46.545 --> 09:48.588
the cash or not?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.632
"And my job in Alaska is great.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.261
"I'm making tons of money

09:51.674 --> 09:54.261
and lots of great friends,

09:54.302 --> 09:55.803
"so your dire predictions of me

09:55.845 --> 09:58.348
"being miserable

09:55.845 --> 09:58.348
and taken advantage of

09:58.390 --> 10:00.350
were, as always, dead wrong."

10:00.392 --> 10:01.809
Well, he's a good boy, Lois.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.311
All our sons are good kids.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.729
You know Mrs. Potts

10:03.353 --> 10:04.729
down at the church?

10:04.771 --> 10:06.523
She says the boys

10:04.771 --> 10:06.523
have been a godsend.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.358
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:08.400 --> 10:10.110
Where you boys off to?

10:10.151 --> 10:12.487
We told Mrs. Potts we'd

10:10.151 --> 10:12.487
be back right after lunch.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.864
Charity's fun-- thanks, Mom.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.826
Well, what do you know?

10:18.868 --> 10:22.080
I finally feel like we're doing

10:18.868 --> 10:22.080
something right with those kids.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.630
♪ ♪

11:06.749 --> 11:08.168
This is ridiculous.

11:08.209 --> 11:12.589
The wolves had me treed for

11:08.209 --> 11:12.589
half an hour on the way there.

11:12.631 --> 11:15.175
I have just about had... Ow!

11:15.216 --> 11:18.094
You can't treat us like this!

11:18.136 --> 11:19.429
This isn't human.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.222
We're citizens.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.517
This is America.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.725
Isn't it?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.727
(crying):

11:24.767 --> 11:26.727
I'm sorry, Francis.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.729
This is all my fault.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.233
Stop crying.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.527
It's okay, man.

11:33.568 --> 11:34.528
No, it isn't.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.321
God, you must hate me.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.572
Oh, come on.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.157
You're my friend.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.741
I can't hate you.

11:40.783 --> 11:46.705
(Pete playing "Strangers

11:40.783 --> 11:46.705
in the Night" on harmonica)

11:49.792 --> 11:51.169
Um, sorry.

11:51.211 --> 11:55.423
I thought

11:51.211 --> 11:55.423
I was picking up a vibe.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.424
Look...

11:56.466 --> 11:57.592
Lavernia may be evil

11:57.634 --> 11:58.759
and she may be tough,

11:58.801 --> 11:59.760
but we're better than her

11:59.802 --> 12:01.680
and we can find a way

11:59.802 --> 12:01.680
to beat her.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.140
How? Our lives are controlled

12:01.720 --> 12:04.140
by that ledger book of hers.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.766
Everything we do

12:04.182 --> 12:05.766
puts us deeper in dept.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.811
This is precisely what military

12:05.808 --> 12:08.811
school prepared us for.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.063
To wage war

12:10.104 --> 12:12.773
against all authority

12:10.104 --> 12:12.773
no matter what the odds.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.775
She may be a cruel,

12:12.815 --> 12:14.775
manipulative monster,

12:14.817 --> 12:16.444
but Mom can't win every round.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.153
Who?

12:17.195 --> 12:18.572
Lavernia.

12:18.613 --> 12:19.864
We got to get her back

12:18.613 --> 12:19.864
even harder.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.949
We got to get her

12:19.906 --> 12:21.949
where she lives.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.784
We got to get that book.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.705
I hate that book.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.789
You know what book I hate?

12:28.831 --> 12:31.167
Valley of the Dolls.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.420
What kind of ending was that?

12:39.926 --> 12:41.386
Okay, Stevie's looking

12:41.428 --> 12:42.512
for some Pam Grier

12:41.428 --> 12:42.512
memorabilia

12:42.554 --> 12:43.804
if he can keep it here.

12:43.846 --> 12:44.805
As long as he's got the money,

12:44.847 --> 12:46.600
the church doesn't care.

12:46.641 --> 12:47.808
And the guy

12:46.641 --> 12:47.808
at the liquor store says

12:47.850 --> 12:48.893
he'll take the bread maker.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.271
You know what?

12:48.935 --> 12:51.271
We're up to $159.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.606
What do you think

12:52.647 --> 12:53.814
we should do with it?

12:53.856 --> 12:55.400
I say we buy a saddle.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.526
Once we have

12:55.442 --> 12:56.526
the saddle,

12:56.568 --> 12:58.111
Mom and Dad can't say no

12:56.568 --> 12:58.111
to the horse.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.613
I don't want a horse.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.906
We all worked for this.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.906
I say we vote on what we get.

13:01.948 --> 13:02.990
Dewey?

13:03.032 --> 13:04.992
Can God see everything we do?

13:05.034 --> 13:06.620
What?

13:06.661 --> 13:07.828
Mrs. Potts said

13:07.870 --> 13:10.081
God sees everything we do.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.082
Yeah, Dewey,

13:11.124 --> 13:13.126
God can magically

13:11.124 --> 13:13.126
see through roofs.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.127
What are you

13:14.168 --> 13:15.211
worried about?

13:15.253 --> 13:16.837
We're not doing anything wrong.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.797
Then how come we have money?

13:20.883 --> 13:23.637
Well, uh, sometimes

13:20.883 --> 13:23.637
when you do good things,

13:23.678 --> 13:25.263
good things

13:23.678 --> 13:25.263
happen for you.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.849
Satisfied?

13:28.891 --> 13:30.851
I mean, think of it

13:28.891 --> 13:30.851
this way, Dewey,

13:30.893 --> 13:33.854
people are still getting

13:30.893 --> 13:33.854
the things they need,

13:33.896 --> 13:36.107
and, uh, okay,

13:33.896 --> 13:36.107
we do have some money,

13:36.149 --> 13:38.151
but, uh, the church does, too.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.321
So, I mean, no one's

13:38.192 --> 13:41.321
really getting hurt, and...

13:41.362 --> 13:42.821
(floor creaks in hallway)

13:55.918 --> 13:58.087
This is bad.

13:58.129 --> 14:01.257
I say once we get the saddle,

13:58.129 --> 14:01.257
we should just quit.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.509
We're not getting the saddle.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.051
This was a mistake

14:02.550 --> 14:04.051
from the beginning.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.886
I should have known

14:04.093 --> 14:05.886
something was wrong

14:05.928 --> 14:06.929
when  you  started

14:05.928 --> 14:06.929
making so much sense.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.723
This is your fault.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.891
You're the one that's

14:08.765 --> 14:10.891
supposed to be smart enough

14:10.933 --> 14:11.976
to keep us out of trouble.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.728
And that's why

14:12.018 --> 14:13.728
you're going to hell.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.188
We're all going to hell!

14:15.229 --> 14:15.896
You guys

14:15.938 --> 14:16.939
seen the remote

14:16.981 --> 14:18.191
for...

14:19.442 --> 14:21.902
What's going on?

14:21.944 --> 14:24.197
Dad, we've done

14:21.944 --> 14:24.197
something terrible.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.826
It might just be

14:24.238 --> 14:27.826
the worst thing

14:24.238 --> 14:27.826
we've ever done.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.786
All right, just calm down.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.621
Let's talk this through.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.122
It can't be that bad.

14:33.164 --> 14:37.084
You've been stealing money

14:33.164 --> 14:37.084
from the church?!

14:37.126 --> 14:40.921
And maybe some merchandise.

14:44.967 --> 14:45.926
Oh...

14:45.968 --> 14:49.723
Oh... you boys

14:45.968 --> 14:49.723
have been taking stereos!

14:49.764 --> 14:51.599
Toys!

14:51.641 --> 14:53.142
Is that cheese?

14:53.184 --> 14:54.352
Oh, God.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.020
(whimpering):

14:54.394 --> 14:56.020
Oh...

14:56.062 --> 14:58.314
I need to sit.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.982
(gasping)

15:00.024 --> 15:01.942
Ha... oh...

15:01.984 --> 15:03.444
Oh, my God.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.654
Dewey, get a washcloth.

15:04.696 --> 15:05.864
My boys are thieves.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.948
Here you go, Dad.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.534
Here.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.452
(sighing)

15:11.494 --> 15:12.412
Nice and even.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.288
(breathing and whimpering)

15:21.838 --> 15:24.965
You stole air?

15:25.007 --> 15:27.260
What is wrong with you boys?!

15:27.301 --> 15:29.220
Do you ever stop

15:27.301 --> 15:29.220
and think

15:29.262 --> 15:32.223
of the consequences of

15:29.262 --> 15:32.223
anything that you do?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.224
Do you realize

15:32.265 --> 15:33.224
the shame

15:33.266 --> 15:34.809
that you're going to bring upon

15:34.851 --> 15:35.810
our entire family?!

15:35.852 --> 15:36.811
Do you?!

15:36.853 --> 15:38.813
Forget that.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.813
What's Mom going to say?

15:40.064 --> 15:41.357
All right, what

15:40.064 --> 15:41.357
we're going to do

15:41.399 --> 15:42.983
is sneak this stuff

15:41.399 --> 15:42.983
back into the church,

15:43.025 --> 15:44.985
and no one will ever

15:43.025 --> 15:44.985
know this happened.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.985
Understood?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.987
You know, the church just left

15:45.027 --> 15:46.987
us alone with all that stuff.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.989
I think it was entrapment.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.991
Reese, look, I don't want

15:49.031 --> 15:50.991
to hear any more excuses.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.993
I'm tired of you boys

15:51.033 --> 15:52.993
not taking respons...

15:53.035 --> 15:55.413
Oh, damn!

15:55.455 --> 15:56.873
It's God!

15:56.915 --> 15:58.165
He found us!

15:58.207 --> 15:59.292
It's not God, Dewey.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.877
It's just my crappy car.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.169
Although in a larger sense

16:02.211 --> 16:03.922
I suppose he could have

16:02.211 --> 16:03.922
helped out my career

16:03.963 --> 16:05.005
a bit from time to time.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.801
Throw a promotion my way

16:05.047 --> 16:07.801
once in a while!

16:07.842 --> 16:09.385
So you're right.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.385
Maybe it is God!

16:09.427 --> 16:11.011
Hey, I don't want

16:09.427 --> 16:11.011
to scare anyone,

16:11.053 --> 16:12.889
but this is the street

16:11.053 --> 16:12.889
Mom takes home from work,

16:12.931 --> 16:14.891
and she gets off in ten minutes!

16:15.475 --> 16:17.435
Son of a...

16:17.477 --> 16:19.813
Geez.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.105
Oh...

16:21.147 --> 16:22.064
Oh, hey, you, sir.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.691
How would you like a shirt?

16:23.733 --> 16:25.025
Three shirts and maybe

16:23.733 --> 16:25.025
some pants to go with them.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.653
What are you, about a 34 waist?

16:26.694 --> 16:28.112
What are you doing?

16:26.694 --> 16:28.112
I don't want any of these.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.196
Why not? They're free!

16:29.238 --> 16:30.114
What's wrong with them?

16:30.156 --> 16:31.282
Nothing.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.034
Oh, for God's sake,

16:31.324 --> 16:34.034
just give me five bucks.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.495
All right.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.495
What's going on here?

16:35.536 --> 16:38.038
He's selling me all this

16:35.536 --> 16:38.038
stuff for five bucks.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.081
Really?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.041
Oh, I'll give you five

16:39.123 --> 16:41.041
for that little TV.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.042
Deal.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.294
Okay, all right,

16:42.084 --> 16:43.294
gather around!

16:43.336 --> 16:44.545
Gather around!

16:44.587 --> 16:45.839
I've got a good-as-new

16:44.587 --> 16:45.839
stereo system.

16:45.880 --> 16:46.840
Who's next?

16:46.881 --> 16:48.675
MAN:

16:46.881 --> 16:48.675
I am.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.051
This your stuff?

16:51.093 --> 16:53.554
Uh... all right, I know how

16:51.093 --> 16:53.554
this must look, Officer,

16:53.596 --> 16:56.307
but I can assure you, I didn't

16:53.596 --> 16:56.307
steal any of these things.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.017
My boys took them from a church.

17:06.025 --> 17:10.404
Neither one of you nimrods leave

17:06.025 --> 17:10.404
till that grill is spotless.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.576
And after you've

17:14.158 --> 17:15.576
done that,

17:15.618 --> 17:17.662
I want you to get

17:15.618 --> 17:17.662
that jar of poison

17:17.704 --> 17:19.079
and bait those rat traps.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.581
That doesn't

17:19.121 --> 17:20.581
make any sense.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.459
Why do we need to poison

17:20.623 --> 17:23.459
them if we have traps?

17:23.501 --> 17:26.045
Because I'll fire your ass.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.140
Perfect.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.767
Nice job with the tape.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.727
Thanks.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.812
See, most people put

17:40.768 --> 17:42.812
the tape on too tight,

17:42.854 --> 17:44.981
so you don't get

17:42.854 --> 17:44.981
that realistic clang.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.106
Come to Papa.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.817
The best part is,

17:46.148 --> 17:47.817
everyone hates her so much,

17:47.859 --> 17:49.485
she'll never be able

17:47.859 --> 17:49.485
to pin this on us.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.278
Oh, my God.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.278
Look at this

17:49.527 --> 17:51.278
next to my name.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.031
"Emotionally dependent

17:51.320 --> 17:53.031
on pornography.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.114
Loves nut clusters."

17:54.156 --> 17:56.993
How does she know

17:54.156 --> 17:56.993
I love nut clusters?

17:57.035 --> 17:58.745
(fence clinks)

18:02.415 --> 18:06.126
(groaning and grunting)

18:06.168 --> 18:08.295
You took the tape

18:06.168 --> 18:08.295
off the door!

18:08.337 --> 18:10.548
You dragged me to Alaska!

18:15.428 --> 18:19.390
(both crying)

18:23.686 --> 18:27.065
Listen, if you do hear

18:23.686 --> 18:27.065
from them, please call me.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.610
(phone rings)

18:30.651 --> 18:32.236
Yes? Hal, you had me

18:30.651 --> 18:32.236
worried sick.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.155
The police said they released

18:32.278 --> 18:35.155
you three hours ago.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.156
What's going on?

18:36.198 --> 18:37.742
I know by now you've

18:36.198 --> 18:37.742
heard everything.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.577
I just think it's prudent

18:37.784 --> 18:39.577
that the boys and I

18:39.619 --> 18:40.870
disappear for

18:39.619 --> 18:40.870
a little while.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.664
Hal, where are you?

18:43.706 --> 18:46.000
I'm afraid that I'm not at

18:43.706 --> 18:46.000
liberty to reveal that, Lois.

18:46.042 --> 18:50.088
MAN:

18:46.042 --> 18:50.088
Bus number 23 for Omaha

18:46.042 --> 18:50.088
is ready for boarding.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.172
Hal, you're a middle-aged man.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.174
You can't run away from home.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.259
Well, I have

18:54.216 --> 18:55.259
a credit card

18:55.301 --> 18:56.552
that begs to

18:55.301 --> 18:56.552
differ, Lois.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.178
Hang up, Dad,

18:56.594 --> 18:58.178
she's tracing the call.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.556
Don't you dare hang up

18:58.220 --> 19:00.556
that phone!

19:00.598 --> 19:02.809
Hal, you're not

19:00.598 --> 19:02.809
going to do this.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.895
You and the boys are going

19:02.850 --> 19:05.895
to come home right now.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.064
And why would I do that?

19:08.106 --> 19:10.274
Because you love me too much

19:08.106 --> 19:10.274
to run away.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.618
That-that may be true, Lois.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.578
But maybe we'll

19:20.660 --> 19:22.578
just have to--

19:22.620 --> 19:24.831
going to have-have a long-

19:22.620 --> 19:24.831
distance relationship

19:24.872 --> 19:26.082
for a while.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.375
Some-some of those can work.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.128
Hal, have you thought

19:28.417 --> 19:30.128
for two seconds

19:30.169 --> 19:31.879
what your life would be like

19:30.169 --> 19:31.879
without me?

19:31.921 --> 19:35.133
Well, no, I don't...

19:35.174 --> 19:37.927
Do you have any idea how much

19:35.174 --> 19:37.927
you'd miss me? Do you?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.598
Yes.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.644
Yes, yes, I...

19:42.640 --> 19:46.644
I have some idea.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.146
Dad, you're folding.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.313
He's folding!

19:49.355 --> 19:52.232
I knew we should have paid

19:49.355 --> 19:52.232
that wino

19:52.274 --> 19:53.233
to make the call.

19:53.275 --> 19:57.613
Uh, honey...

19:57.655 --> 19:59.157
we're back.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.491
Hey, guys.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.618
Why don't you wash up?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.618
Dinner's ready.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.120
I made your favorite.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.246
Meat loaf and mashed potatoes.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.167
Okay.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.250
Great.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.878
Why isn't she mad?

20:19.343 --> 20:20.427
What happened?

20:20.469 --> 20:21.929
All of our

20:20.469 --> 20:21.929
stuff's gone.

20:21.971 --> 20:22.889
That's right.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.264
I gave it all to charity.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.975
You now have two changes

20:24.306 --> 20:25.975
of clothes.

20:26.017 --> 20:29.145
One for school and one for home.

20:29.187 --> 20:30.563
Something wrong?

20:30.604 --> 20:33.232
No problem.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.232
No, we're fine.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.232
No, of course not.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.276
More wine?

20:36.318 --> 20:38.362
Please.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.281
So, how long is it

20:38.404 --> 20:41.281
going to take us

20:41.323 --> 20:43.325
to work off

20:41.323 --> 20:43.325
all this stuff?

20:43.367 --> 20:44.368
Well, this...

20:44.410 --> 20:47.287
should put us

20:44.410 --> 20:47.287
into the 23rd century.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.873
Sesame cracker?

20:48.915 --> 20:51.125
Hmm, don't mind if I do.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.255
(sighs)

21:06.348 --> 21:08.517
I've been lying here,

21:06.348 --> 21:08.517
thinking about God.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.310
I don't know much--

21:10.352 --> 21:14.023
just that he's this

21:10.352 --> 21:14.023
all-powerful, all-knowing being.

21:14.065 --> 21:16.109
Kind of like Mom,

21:14.065 --> 21:16.109
only invisible.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.736
So I feel better being

21:16.150 --> 21:18.736
on his good side for a while.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.362
And you know what?

21:20.404 --> 21:22.156
We probably all spend a little

21:20.404 --> 21:22.156
too much of our lives

21:22.198 --> 21:24.658
focusing on material things.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.327
What are you doing?

21:27.369 --> 21:29.247
Praying.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.247
No, you're not!

21:29.288 --> 21:31.415
He's got chocolate!

21:29.288 --> 21:31.415
Get him!

21:31.457 --> 21:33.542
(screams)

21:31.457 --> 21:33.542
Come on, give it.
