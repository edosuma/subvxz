03:19.596 --> 03:23.179
Daddy, you're sure I've
never been to Africa before?

03:23.350 --> 03:24.725
It looks familiar.

03:25.769 --> 03:29.601
You saw the same scenery last
summer driving to Las Vegas.

03:29.773 --> 03:32.809
Oh, sure. Where Daddy lost
all that money at the crap -

03:32.985 --> 03:35.024
- Hank!
- Table.

03:36.321 --> 03:39.108
<i>Hey, look! A camel!</i>

03:42.494 --> 03:46.278
Uh-huh. Course this isn't really
Africa. It's the French Morocco.

03:46.456 --> 03:47.867
Well, it's Northern Africa.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.536
Still seems like Las Vegas.

03:49.710 --> 03:53.542
We're just a hundred miles
north of the Sahara Desert.

03:53.714 --> 03:57.379
I don't know. In school they
call this the Dark Continent.

03:57.551 --> 03:59.923
This is twice as bright as Indianapolis.

04:00.095 --> 04:01.755
You just wait till we get to Marrakech.

04:01.930 --> 04:07.173
- Marrakech? Sounds like a drink.
- Mmm. It sure does.

04:40.010 --> 04:43.213
Wait a minute. Hold on
there. What's the matter?

05:04.076 --> 05:06.318
Well, I sure want to thank you.

05:06.495 --> 05:08.618
Without your help, anything
might have happened here.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.159
My pleasure, monsieur.

05:10.332 --> 05:13.286
There are moments in life
when we all need a little help.

05:13.460 --> 05:16.414
Yeah. Just what was the trouble?

05:16.588 --> 05:19.625
Uh... your little boy accidentally
pulled off his wife's veil.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.291
- Oh. Yeah.
- Hank!

05:22.469 --> 05:24.094
<i>I want to introduce my wife, Mrs McKenna.</i>

05:24.263 --> 05:25.673
- How do you do?
- How do you do, madame?

05:25.848 --> 05:27.472
My name is Louis Bernard.

05:28.058 --> 05:29.967
We thank you very much, Mr Bernard.

05:30.143 --> 05:32.302
- That's our son, Hank.
- Hello, Hank.

05:32.479 --> 05:34.555
Hello. You talk Arab talk.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.472
A few words.

05:36.650 --> 05:38.856
Why was he angry? It was an accident.

05:39.278 --> 05:43.110
But the Muslim religion
allows for few accidents.

05:43.490 --> 05:45.115
- Yeah, I suppose so.
- Oh.

05:45.284 --> 05:48.154
- May I?
- Yeah, sit down right in front of Jo.

05:49.121 --> 05:51.659
Oh, I thought his name was Hank.

05:51.832 --> 05:53.623
Oh, it's my wife's name.

05:53.792 --> 05:56.544
- J-O. No E. -
How different.

05:56.712 --> 05:57.910
Short for Josephine.

05:58.088 --> 06:01.338
I've called her that so long
nobody knows her by any other name.

06:01.508 --> 06:04.462
- I do. Mommy.
- Oh, yeah.

06:04.636 --> 06:06.095
Now, about the accident.

06:06.263 --> 06:10.557
A Muslim woman never takes off her
veil in public under any circumstances.

06:10.726 --> 06:12.434
They feed her intravenously?

06:12.728 --> 06:16.097
- No, Hank.
- What a big word for such a small boy.

06:16.273 --> 06:18.100
I'm a doctor.

06:18.275 --> 06:20.896
Oh. Well, he sounds like one.

06:21.069 --> 06:23.643
He can spell haemoglobin.

06:23.822 --> 06:26.147
He has a little trouble
with words like dog and cat.

06:28.243 --> 06:29.737
Where do you practise, doctor?

06:29.912 --> 06:33.446
Indianapolis, Indiana. Good
Samaritan Hospital out there.

06:33.624 --> 06:35.284
What brings you to Marrakech?

06:35.459 --> 06:37.665
We were attending a
medical convention in Paris

06:37.836 --> 06:39.580
and I thought, inasmuch as we were in Europe,

06:39.755 --> 06:42.210
I'd come and see Morocco again.

06:42.382 --> 06:44.589
Daddy liberated Africa.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.761
<i>I was stationed up in Casablanca</i>

06:47.930 --> 06:50.847
<i>at an army field hospital during the war.</i>

06:51.016 --> 06:53.803
- Do you live in Morocco, Mr Bernard?
- No.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.726
I suppose you came directly from Paris.

06:56.897 --> 06:59.269
No, we looked in on Lisbon and Rome.

06:59.441 --> 07:01.932
<i>- And Casablanca.
- And Casablanca.</i>

07:03.028 --> 07:05.697
I hope you will have time
to truly enjoy Marrakech.

07:05.864 --> 07:08.651
Let's see. We'll have,
at the most, three days.

07:09.368 --> 07:14.030
You will, naturally, be stopping
at the Hotel Mamounia or Le Menara?

07:14.206 --> 07:15.237
Why do you ask?

07:16.458 --> 07:19.412
Because they are hotels
for tourists of good taste.

07:19.586 --> 07:22.789
Oh. Do you live in France, Mr Bernard?

07:22.965 --> 07:25.041
- Sometimes.
- Do you eat snails?

07:25.217 --> 07:27.008
When I'm lucky enough.

07:27.177 --> 07:30.380
If you ever get hungry, our
garden back home is full of snails.

07:30.556 --> 07:32.429
Thank you for the invitation.

07:32.599 --> 07:35.304
That's alright. We tried
everything to get rid of them.

07:35.477 --> 07:38.727
We never thought of a Frenchman.

08:35.871 --> 08:38.113
Here we go.

08:38.289 --> 08:40.828
Say, do you want to share
a taxi with us to the hotel?

08:41.001 --> 08:44.452
That's kind of you, Doctor, but
unfortunately I have some business first.

08:44.630 --> 08:47.121
- Oh. OK.
- What business are you in, Mr Bernard?

08:47.299 --> 08:50.549
I'll be there later and perhaps
we might have a drink together.

08:50.719 --> 08:52.510
Come up to our suite.
We'll have a drink up there.

08:52.679 --> 08:56.380
- In that case, I will take you to dinner.
- No, no. That's not fair.

08:56.558 --> 08:59.049
I know Marrakech. I can
show you an Arab restaurant

08:59.228 --> 09:02.015
where the food is different
and the manner of eating exotic.

09:02.189 --> 09:04.596
That's what we came here for.

09:04.775 --> 09:07.017
- How about one of those Arabian nights?
- I'd love it.

09:07.986 --> 09:11.521
How would you prefer to
travel to the hotel, by taxi?

09:11.698 --> 09:14.865
- Gee, I don't know.
- A wagon! I wanna ride in a wagon!

09:15.744 --> 09:18.579
I guess it's a wagon. See you later.

09:18.747 --> 09:21.072
Au revoir. I look forward to the cocktails.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.538
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.672
Hank, you sit up with the driver.

09:27.840 --> 09:31.173
How do you like this? A
horse-drawn convertible.

09:45.107 --> 09:47.432
Well, I just saw Louis
Bernard talking to that Arab.

09:47.609 --> 09:50.563
- What Arab?
- The one that was shouting at Hank.

09:50.737 --> 09:52.315
They were talking like
they were dear friends.

09:52.489 --> 09:53.864
Well, he probably knew him before.

09:54.032 --> 09:55.859
What does that mean?

09:56.034 --> 09:59.368
It means that Mr Bernard
is a very mysterious man.

09:59.538 --> 10:03.156
What? He seemed perfectly normal to me.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.326
Now, what do you really know about him?

10:05.502 --> 10:08.622
What do I
- I know his name. We were sitting there, we were talking.

10:08.797 --> 10:13.340
You don't know anything about this
man, and he knows everything about you.

10:13.510 --> 10:14.541
Oh, wait.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.926
<i>He knows that you live
in Indianapolis, Indiana.</i>

10:17.097 --> 10:19.766
<i>He knows you're a doctor at
the Good Samaritan Hospital.</i>

10:20.601 --> 10:23.685
He knows that you attended a
medical convention in Paris,

10:23.854 --> 10:27.104
and that you stopped off in
Rome, Lisbon and Casablanca.

10:27.274 --> 10:28.519
Alright.

10:28.692 --> 10:33.188
He knows that you served in North
Africa in an army field hospital.

10:33.363 --> 10:36.649
Honey, it was just a casual
conversation, that's all.

10:36.825 --> 10:38.901
Darling, you weren't just talking casually.

10:39.077 --> 10:42.197
He was asking all kinds of questions,
and you were answering them.

10:42.372 --> 10:43.950
You might as well have
handed him your passport.

10:44.124 --> 10:48.667
We just had a conversation.
I've got nothing to hide.

10:48.837 --> 10:52.538
But I have a feeling that Mr Bernard has.

10:52.716 --> 10:54.590
I know this is mysterious Morocco,

10:54.760 --> 10:57.630
but we're not gonna lose our head, are we?

10:57.804 --> 11:00.556
- I know. I know what it is.
- What?

11:00.724 --> 11:04.342
You're sore because this fella
didn't ask you any questions.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.355
- Oh, hardy-har-har.
- Hardy-har.

11:49.314 --> 11:52.434
- Well, this eases the pain.
- What pain, Mommy?

11:52.609 --> 11:55.279
- It's just an expression.
- Hey, can you take care of the driver?

11:55.445 --> 11:58.281
- My name is Dr McKenna.
- I'll take care of everything.

12:04.246 --> 12:06.369
- Come on.
- We're being watched.

12:06.540 --> 12:08.414
What? Oh, come on!

12:23.515 --> 12:27.347
<i># Que sera, sera</i>

12:27.519 --> 12:30.520
<i># What will be will be</i>

12:30.689 --> 12:35.268
<i># When I was just a little boy</i>

12:35.444 --> 12:37.733
<i># I asked my mother</i>

12:37.905 --> 12:39.981
<i># What will I be</i>

12:40.157 --> 12:44.107
<i>- He'll make a fine doctor.
- # Will I be handsome</i>

12:44.286 --> 12:46.444
<i># Will I be rich</i>

12:46.622 --> 12:50.619
<i>- # Here's what she said to me
- Come on, darling.</i>

12:50.792 --> 12:54.458
<i># Que sera, sera</i>

12:54.963 --> 12:58.831
<i># Whatever will be will be</i>

12:59.343 --> 13:03.175
<i># The future's not ours to see</i>

13:03.347 --> 13:06.798
<i># Que sera, sera</i>

13:07.726 --> 13:11.142
<i># What will be will be.</i>

13:11.313 --> 13:12.855
Second verse.

13:13.023 --> 13:17.317
<i># When I was just a child in school</i>

13:17.486 --> 13:19.775
<i># I asked my teacher</i>

13:19.947 --> 13:21.986
<i># What should I try</i>

13:22.157 --> 13:23.272
Catch.

13:23.450 --> 13:25.692
<i># Should I paint pictures</i>

13:25.869 --> 13:28.158
<i># Should I sing songs</i>

13:28.330 --> 13:31.746
<i># This was her wise reply</i>

13:31.917 --> 13:35.915
<i># Que sera, sera</i>

13:36.088 --> 13:40.251
<i># Whatever will be will be</i>

13:40.425 --> 13:44.423
<i># The future's not ours to see</i>

13:44.596 --> 13:47.266
<i># Que sera, sera.</i>

13:47.432 --> 13:48.677
Oops.

13:49.017 --> 13:52.469
<i># What will be will be</i>

13:52.646 --> 13:53.761
May I have this next dance?

13:53.939 --> 13:55.219
- Yes.
- Alright.

13:55.399 --> 13:59.099
<i># Dum, dee,
dum-da-dum</i>

14:00.529 --> 14:01.904
<i>#
Da-da-da-da #</i>

14:02.072 --> 14:03.946
<i>Oh, you're divine.</i>

14:09.746 --> 14:13.696
- Dinner for the boy.
- Yeah, come in.

14:16.879 --> 14:19.370
I can't tell you how
beautifully your wife sings.

14:19.548 --> 14:22.881
- Pretty good, isn't she?
- Oh, she's marvellous.

14:23.051 --> 14:24.427
Too bad it was interrupted.

14:24.595 --> 14:27.216
I've had that same feeling myself many times.

14:27.681 --> 14:29.923
Well, everything's fine. The
manager has a babysitter for us.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.131
Good.

14:31.310 --> 14:33.635
Permit me the pleasure
of serving you a drink.

14:33.812 --> 14:35.852
I would love it. Thank you.

14:36.023 --> 14:39.059
Were you on the American stage, Mrs McKenna?

14:42.404 --> 14:44.895
Yes, Mr Bernard, I was on the American stage

14:45.073 --> 14:46.865
and the London stage and the Paris stage.

14:47.034 --> 14:48.232
Oh?

14:48.410 --> 14:50.818
I thought perhaps you had
seen me in Paris, being French.

14:50.996 --> 14:53.913
The theatre requires time,

14:54.082 --> 14:56.538
and for me time is often a luxury.

14:58.378 --> 15:00.252
Have you ever been to Paris, Mr Bernard?

15:01.882 --> 15:03.127
I was born there.

15:04.176 --> 15:05.551
Oh.

15:11.225 --> 15:16.052
- What business are you in?
- I buy... and sell.

15:17.064 --> 15:19.815
- What?
- Whatever gives the best profit.

15:24.196 --> 15:26.817
Now that you're in Marrakech,
what are you buying and selling?

15:26.990 --> 15:31.533
You know, I would much
rather talk about the stage.

15:31.703 --> 15:33.530
If you tell me what shows you are in -

15:33.705 --> 15:37.703
<i>Would you excuse me? I'll get it.</i>

15:37.876 --> 15:40.035
- No, I'll get it.
- No, I will.

15:57.938 --> 16:00.394
I'm inquiring for the room of Mr Montgomery.

16:00.566 --> 16:02.772
<i>He asked me for a drink, and I -</i>

16:02.943 --> 16:04.817
I'm sorry. There's no Montgomery here.

16:04.987 --> 16:07.063
Pardon me, monsieur. I regret disturbing you.

16:07.239 --> 16:08.614
<i>OK.</i>

16:19.626 --> 16:21.204
- May I use your telephone, please?
- Sure.

16:21.378 --> 16:22.706
<i>- Mommy!
- Yes?</i>

16:22.880 --> 16:26.462
<i>- I can't cut this meat.
- I'll do it for you.</i>

16:32.681 --> 16:34.590
Merci.

16:35.809 --> 16:37.885
Allô?

16:44.943 --> 16:46.319
<i>D'accord.</i>

16:51.533 --> 16:54.368
I'm terribly sorry, but I cannot
go to dinner with you tonight.

16:54.536 --> 16:57.288
- Oh?
- I have neglected an important matter

16:57.456 --> 17:00.161
- which now requires my attention.
- Oh, I see.

17:00.334 --> 17:04.711
- Perhaps another night?
- Oh, sure, sure.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.789
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

17:08.258 --> 17:10.584
- Bye.
- Good night.

17:11.595 --> 17:12.839
Good night.

17:29.279 --> 17:31.568
- Bonsoir, madame, monsieur.
- My name's McKenna.

17:31.740 --> 17:35.323
Of course. The hotel
phoned. Follow me, please.

17:37.538 --> 17:41.998
- I'm certain you'll find this comfortable.
-  Thank you.

18:12.614 --> 18:16.149
Honey, move over here.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.416
You're on my dress.

18:40.642 --> 18:42.599
Whoop.

18:54.156 --> 18:57.691
Yeah.

18:57.868 --> 19:01.486
We always wash the hands before eating.

19:08.337 --> 19:10.246
Thank you.

19:20.349 --> 19:22.388
- Those people are staring at us.
- What people?

19:22.559 --> 19:24.303
- Right in back of us.
- What?

19:24.478 --> 19:26.305
- Yes.
- Here.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.473
They were staring at us
in front of the hotel too.

19:28.649 --> 19:31.318
Jo, will you please stop imagining things.

19:31.485 --> 19:33.193
I'm not.

19:33.362 --> 19:36.197
Good evening. You must think me awfully rude.

19:36.365 --> 19:38.690
I've been staring at you
since I saw you at the hotel.

19:38.909 --> 19:43.535
<i>- You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway?
- Yes, I am.</i>

19:43.705 --> 19:47.655
I knew I was right. I'm Lucy
Drayton, and this is my husband.

19:47.835 --> 19:50.504
- How do you do?
- We're Dr and Mrs McKenna.

19:50.671 --> 19:54.799
My wife tells me Mrs McKenna
appeared at the London Palladium.

19:54.967 --> 19:56.165
We hardly ever see a show now.

19:56.343 --> 19:58.419
Edward is such an
old stick-in-the-mud

19:58.595 --> 20:01.265
so I have to console
myself with your records.

20:01.431 --> 20:05.892
I must admit I love em. I'm not
one for this terrible be-bop.

20:06.061 --> 20:08.682
- Thank you very much.
- When are you coming back to London?

20:08.856 --> 20:10.765
- Possibly never again, professionally.
- Oh.

20:10.941 --> 20:13.479
- Don't say you're giving up the stage.
- Well, temporarily I am.

20:13.652 --> 20:17.436
It's just that I'm a doctor, and a
doctor's wife never has much time.

20:17.614 --> 20:20.152
What my husband is trying to
say is Broadway musical shows

20:20.325 --> 20:22.282
are not produced in Indianapolis, Indiana.

20:22.452 --> 20:26.746
We could live in New York. I hear that
doctors aren't starving there either.

20:26.915 --> 20:29.869
It's not that I have any
objection to working in New York.

20:30.043 --> 20:33.958
It's just that it'd be hard for my patients
to come from Indianapolis for treatment.

20:34.131 --> 20:36.420
<i>I'm always saying the wrong thing. I'm sorry.</i>

20:36.592 --> 20:37.967
<i>Not in the least.</i>

20:38.135 --> 20:39.677
<i>Dr McKenna, do you -</i>

20:39.845 --> 20:45.052
Why don't all of you sort of
turn around here, or something.

20:45.225 --> 20:47.432
It's kind of
- kind of hard on the neck.

20:48.645 --> 20:50.140
<i>It's in one of our English counties.</i>

20:50.314 --> 20:53.517
<i>It's not what you'd call a farm.
It's more of a small holding.</i>

20:53.692 --> 20:55.732
<i>Here we are.</i>

20:55.903 --> 20:57.183
- Oh.
- Isn't that fascinating?

20:57.362 --> 20:58.738
Yes.

20:59.615 --> 21:01.654
- There we are.
- Uhh.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.203
- Hey, they look good.
- Surprise.

21:06.371 --> 21:09.206
Oh, they look wonderful.

21:09.791 --> 21:11.701
Ah, looks like bread.

21:12.836 --> 21:15.506
- We're not going to eat all that, are we?
- No.

21:15.672 --> 21:17.961
Is that the way you do it?

21:18.133 --> 21:21.170
Yes, just break it, just like this.

21:21.345 --> 21:23.883
It won't break. Oh, no.

21:24.056 --> 21:26.725
Well, I'm gonna
- There.

21:26.892 --> 21:29.928
- Is that the way you do it?
- That's quite alright.

21:30.103 --> 21:32.013
That was a tough one.

21:33.232 --> 21:36.647
Does it chew any better than it tears?

21:37.861 --> 21:41.859
- Is it fattening?
- I imagine it must be.

21:42.032 --> 21:44.784
No, it's pretty good, hon.

21:44.952 --> 21:46.197
- Well, I -
- No plate.

21:46.370 --> 21:48.658
- No?
- No. No knives and forks either.

21:48.830 --> 21:50.325
I understand you're supposed to dig in.

21:50.499 --> 21:52.741
Oh, allow me to show you, will you?

21:52.918 --> 21:55.753
You use only the first two fingers
and thumb of the right hand.

21:55.921 --> 21:59.124
You don't use the other two fingers,
and always the left hand in the lap.

21:59.299 --> 22:01.921
- Oh, I see.
- May I show you?

22:02.094 --> 22:06.008
- Ju-Just these two fingers,
huh? - I'll hold it for you.

22:14.273 --> 22:17.606
- See.
- There we are.

22:17.776 --> 22:20.528
Well, I, uh... uh...

22:20.696 --> 22:22.772
Boy, could I use this hand.

22:22.948 --> 22:26.946
- I can't, uh...
- It's alright.

22:27.119 --> 22:29.195
- It's good stuff.
- No one minds.

22:29.371 --> 22:32.787
- It's messy, but worth it.
- I'll practise on an olive.

22:32.958 --> 22:35.912
Oh, honey, it's wonderful. Here. Take a bite.

22:36.086 --> 22:37.794
- Good?
- Yeah.

22:37.963 --> 22:40.999
Tell me
- does this way of eating have to do with religion, or something?

22:41.175 --> 22:43.132
I think it's more social than religious.

22:43.302 --> 22:44.333
I don't know.

22:44.511 --> 22:47.085
It seems like if you have
four good fingers and a thumb

22:47.264 --> 22:50.300
you oughta be able to use all of em.

22:50.475 --> 22:52.219
- It's very good.
- Very good.

22:53.020 --> 22:54.847
Well, as I was saying,

22:55.022 --> 22:58.556
I was quite happy farming my bit of land

22:58.734 --> 23:01.059
when these United Nations
fellows started worrying me.

23:01.236 --> 23:04.107
Edward was a big noise in the
Ministry of Food during the war.

23:04.281 --> 23:07.864
So we pulled ourselves up at the roots,
and here we are, United Nations Relief.

23:09.077 --> 23:10.655
Sounds like interesting work.

23:10.829 --> 23:14.032
I'm preparing a report on
soil erosion at the moment.

23:14.208 --> 23:18.039
Parts of this country are not
unlike your dustbowl formation.

23:18.212 --> 23:19.670
A thin layer of topsoil,

23:19.838 --> 23:21.463
<i>and underneath, so -</i>

23:29.681 --> 23:32.599
How do you like that? First he
promises to take us to dinner -

23:32.768 --> 23:36.184
Yeah. Well, we just met him today, honey.

23:36.355 --> 23:38.680
You can't expect him to
change his whole life.

23:38.857 --> 23:40.684
Ben, what's the matter with you?

23:40.859 --> 23:43.267
Nothing. What's the matter with you?

23:43.445 --> 23:45.817
<i>I just don't want to be insulted.</i>

23:45.989 --> 23:47.982
Oh, you're not being insulted.

23:48.158 --> 23:52.026
You can't blame him for turning
down an old married couple like us.

23:52.204 --> 23:55.739
- We're not an old married couple!
- Alright.

23:55.916 --> 23:57.244
Alright, he's a heel.

23:57.417 --> 23:58.449
I don't understand him,

23:58.627 --> 24:01.332
but I'm beginning not to like
what he's doing to our whole night.

24:01.505 --> 24:03.830
I must do some shopping
in the market tomorrow.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.122
I do hope it will be fine.

24:05.759 --> 24:07.882
<i>Well, not too fine.</i>

24:08.053 --> 24:11.137
I know our English weather is
pretty awful, but sometimes,

24:11.306 --> 24:13.216
<i>we don't realise when we're lucky.</i>

24:13.392 --> 24:18.054
<i>All this sunshine day after day,
well, it doesn't seem natural somehow.</i>

24:18.230 --> 24:20.223
- I want to get up.
- Ben, don't.

24:20.399 --> 24:24.693
I know you. Once you get
worked up, you start a fight.

24:25.654 --> 24:27.397
Will you come to the market with us tomorrow?

24:27.573 --> 24:30.609
As a matter of fact, Louis
Bernard, the big buyer from Paris,

24:30.784 --> 24:32.658
was going to take us to
the marketplace tomorrow.

24:32.828 --> 24:37.704
- Yeah. I think I'll cancel out.
- Sit down and eat your dinner.

24:37.875 --> 24:40.745
- We - We'd love to go.
- Oh, we'd be delighted.

24:40.919 --> 24:45.083
I don't know why he gets so
worked up over unimportant things.

24:50.053 --> 24:53.304
<i>Non, Monsieur! Monsieur.</i>

25:15.704 --> 25:18.409
<i># Ho! Ho! Ho!</i>

25:18.582 --> 25:20.824
<i># Ho, ho, ho, ho!</i>

25:56.161 --> 25:58.070
What's he saying, Mrs Drayton?

25:58.247 --> 25:59.789
He's the teller of tales, Hank.

26:03.836 --> 26:05.294
Isn't this exciting?

26:05.462 --> 26:07.040
Just like the county fair when I was a kid.

26:07.214 --> 26:10.001
They got everything but
the balloon ascension.

26:13.053 --> 26:15.544
What's so funny? Did you
ever see a balloon ascension?

26:15.722 --> 26:18.759
I was thinking. You know what's paying
for these three days in Marakesh?

26:18.934 --> 26:21.686
- Me.
- Mrs Campbell's gallstones.

26:21.854 --> 26:23.229
Oh.

26:23.397 --> 26:25.188
- You know the purse I bought in Paris?
- Yeah.

26:25.357 --> 26:27.563
Bill Edward's tonsils.

26:27.734 --> 26:29.229
<i>Mommy! Daddy!</i>

26:29.403 --> 26:33.270
Daddy, come with us! We're
gonna see the medicine man.

26:33.448 --> 26:36.817
- Maybe you can learn something, Daddy.
- I wouldn't be surprised.

26:36.994 --> 26:38.322
Anytime he starts wearing you out -

26:38.495 --> 26:42.409
I haven't enjoyed the market so much.

26:42.583 --> 26:45.287
- I never thought of it that way before.
- What?

26:45.460 --> 26:49.541
I'm wearing Johnny Matthews' appendix.

26:49.715 --> 26:51.173
What about the boat trip?

26:51.341 --> 26:53.915
It took two boys, one girl, and
two sets of twins, didn't it?

26:54.094 --> 26:57.214
And Mrs Morgan's hives.

27:03.437 --> 27:05.643
- How are the acrobats today?
- Wonderful.

27:05.814 --> 27:08.388
Watch that kid that goes
clear to the top there.

27:08.567 --> 27:10.975
- I'll see you later.
- Yes.

27:13.614 --> 27:17.232
All the way home we'll be
riding on Herbie Taylor's ulcers.

27:17.409 --> 27:19.567
And Allida Markle's asthma.

27:19.745 --> 27:23.327
Now if we could just get four cases
of seven- year-itch we could retire.

27:23.498 --> 27:25.491
Or if Mrs Yarrow's really
gonna have triplets,

27:25.667 --> 27:28.621
we could completely redecorate the house.

27:28.795 --> 27:31.002
What would they say if they heard us?

27:31.173 --> 27:33.925
One of the reasons I came
to a place like Marakesh

27:34.092 --> 27:36.797
is so we could say things like
that without everybody hearing us.

27:39.389 --> 27:41.845
I'd like to say something
where nobody could hear us.

27:42.017 --> 27:43.677
This is the safest place.

27:43.852 --> 27:47.221
When are we going to have another baby?

27:47.397 --> 27:49.853
You're the doctor. You have all the answers.

27:50.025 --> 27:53.026
Yeah, but this is the first time
I've ever heard the question.

27:53.195 --> 27:55.947
<i>Mommy, look! Come here!</i>

27:59.117 --> 28:03.281
Look. Sewing machines. Looks
like a television commercial.

28:04.540 --> 28:06.532
- Having a good time, Hank?
- I guess so.

28:06.708 --> 28:09.544
He's delighted with everything.

28:17.302 --> 28:19.544
Hank! Hank, come back here!

28:19.721 --> 28:21.963
- Hank!
- Hank!

28:22.140 --> 28:24.845
- It's best to keep out of trouble, Hank.
- What's going on?

28:25.018 --> 28:27.723
<i>Looks like the police are chasing somebody.</i>

29:02.639 --> 29:04.217
Aaah!

29:28.207 --> 29:30.413
Hey. Hey, look there.

29:34.046 --> 29:36.122
You better stand back. Go on. Stand back.

29:52.940 --> 29:54.054
Monsieur McKenna.

29:57.236 --> 29:58.813
I'm Louis Bernard.

30:04.785 --> 30:08.154
A man, a statesman,

30:09.081 --> 30:11.488
he is to be killed,

30:11.667 --> 30:13.743
assassinated,

30:13.919 --> 30:16.244
in London

30:16.421 --> 30:18.877
soon, very soon.

30:21.385 --> 30:24.054
Tell them in London

30:26.390 --> 30:29.556
Ambrose Chappell.

30:30.936 --> 30:33.012
Chappell.

30:59.715 --> 31:01.458
- Ben, who is he?
- Louis Bernard.

31:01.633 --> 31:03.626
- You got something to write on?
- Louis Bernard!

31:03.802 --> 31:05.177
He's dead.

31:32.789 --> 31:33.952
He says, "Do you know this man?"

31:34.124 --> 31:37.575
Yes, we do know him. He's
Louis Bernard, the French -

31:37.753 --> 31:40.873
Louis Bernard?

31:41.048 --> 31:43.171
Monsieur and Madame McKenna.

31:47.221 --> 31:49.462
He wants you to go to police
headquarters to make a statement.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.843
- OK.
- Our friends have to go to the station.

31:53.018 --> 31:54.927
- I'd better go with them.
- Yes, of course.

32:02.194 --> 32:05.111
You don't want your little boy to go, do you?

32:05.280 --> 32:08.483
But I want to go to the police station.

32:08.659 --> 32:11.197
I think it's better if I
take him back to the hotel.

32:11.370 --> 32:12.780
- Would you, please.
- Certainly.

32:12.955 --> 32:14.579
Thank you. Be good, Hank.

32:15.332 --> 32:18.333
We're to be going.

32:19.002 --> 32:21.920
Heaven knows when we shall be back.

32:26.760 --> 32:30.674
Why do you suppose he turned up in
an Arab outfit and wearing make-up?

32:30.848 --> 32:33.255
What's more important: Why was he killed?

32:33.433 --> 32:35.093
I bet he was a spy or something.

32:35.269 --> 32:37.392
What were you writing down?
What was he telling you?

32:37.563 --> 32:39.602
I'll tell you later.

32:39.773 --> 32:41.932
<i>What is it?</i>

32:42.109 --> 32:44.516
I
- I just feel kinda funny.

32:46.154 --> 32:48.692
Why should he pick me out to tell?

32:48.866 --> 32:51.985
After what we said about him last night.

33:04.882 --> 33:08.547
When we get in with the inspector,
I'll do my best to cut the red tape.

33:08.719 --> 33:13.179
- Fine. Fine.
- I'm going to stretch a bit.

33:13.348 --> 33:17.642
I'm afraid the questions will go till
doomsday if you admit you knew him.

33:17.811 --> 33:20.183
I don't know him at all.
We met yesterday on a bus.

33:20.647 --> 33:24.775
They're a cynical lot, these French.
They might refuse to believe that.

33:24.943 --> 33:27.695
Well, they've got to believe it.

33:27.863 --> 33:29.772
Look at it from their point of view.

33:29.948 --> 33:31.822
They saw this poor fellow whispering to you,

33:31.992 --> 33:34.483
and then they saw you write something down.

33:34.661 --> 33:37.698
Are you gonna show them what you wrote?

33:56.808 --> 34:00.676
Thank you, Mr Drayton, but a
translator will not be necessary.

34:00.854 --> 34:04.769
Won't you come inside, madame, monsieur?

34:04.942 --> 34:09.402
Do me the kindness to wait. I
might have questions for you later.

34:21.208 --> 34:23.199
Passports, please.

34:37.975 --> 34:39.717
You came to French Morocco four days ago?

34:39.893 --> 34:41.802
That's right.

34:41.978 --> 34:44.185
You are a doctor, sir?

34:44.356 --> 34:49.018
Yes, I'm a surgeon, a
tourist and American citizen.

34:49.194 --> 34:51.864
Three good reasons why you should have
nothing in common with Louis Bernard.

34:52.030 --> 34:55.399
<i>I didn't have.</i>

34:55.576 --> 34:56.856
You were in Paris recently?

34:57.077 --> 34:59.782
Yes, I was attending a medical convention.

34:59.955 --> 35:01.579
You came to Marrakech in the same bus.

35:01.748 --> 35:03.408
You had an aperitif with
him in your hotel room.

35:03.584 --> 35:05.457
You ate at the same restaurant last night.

35:05.627 --> 35:07.584
Yes, but at different tables.

35:12.467 --> 35:14.626
So Louis Bernard is a stranger to you?

35:14.803 --> 35:18.219
I met him for the first
time yesterday on a bus.

35:19.516 --> 35:22.268
And yet, out of 5,000 people

35:22.436 --> 35:24.060
in a great marketplace,

35:24.229 --> 35:26.352
he comes to you when he is about to die.

35:27.649 --> 35:30.899
Is that the action of a casual acquaintance?

35:31.069 --> 35:33.774
I know absolutely nothing
about Louis Bernard.

35:33.947 --> 35:37.648
Not even, I suppose, that he was
an agent of the Deuxieme Bureau.

35:38.118 --> 35:40.111
The
- What's that?

35:41.246 --> 35:44.366
Perhaps you have also never
heard of the American FBI?

35:44.541 --> 35:45.656
Now, wait. I -

35:45.834 --> 35:47.661
It would be so much easier for both of us

35:47.836 --> 35:49.829
if you would cease to pretend.

35:50.005 --> 35:51.203
Look here -

35:51.423 --> 35:54.673
The dead man found out what he
had been sent here to discover.

35:54.843 --> 35:55.958
That's why he was killed.

35:56.970 --> 35:59.046
He told you what he had discovered.

35:59.723 --> 36:04.930
<i>Why? Because he placed
complete confidence in you.</i>

36:05.103 --> 36:08.104
You not only ask the questions,
you answer em too, don't you?

36:08.273 --> 36:10.681
Let me ask you a question.

36:10.859 --> 36:14.857
Assuming that Bernard trusted
me as implicitly as you say,

36:15.030 --> 36:17.817
then I'd never reveal anything he said to me.

36:19.034 --> 36:20.314
Even Americans, I suppose,

36:20.494 --> 36:25.370
find it sometimes desirable
to betray a confidence.

36:25.541 --> 36:27.617
Let's get some things straight here.

36:27.793 --> 36:30.082
I'm a tourist. I'm travelling for pleasure.

36:30.254 --> 36:32.579
I somehow got involved in
this very unfortunate incident,

36:32.756 --> 36:34.879
and I came here to make
a simple statement of fact

36:35.050 --> 36:36.841
and not be subjected to a police grilling.

36:37.010 --> 36:39.418
- I would like you - -
No, you let me finish.

36:39.596 --> 36:41.423
<i>Entrez.</i>

36:44.226 --> 36:46.847
Wait a minute. Did he say I
was wanted on the telephone?

36:47.020 --> 36:48.396
I'll take that call now.

36:48.564 --> 36:51.315
- But, sir - - You
just take it easy.

37:02.661 --> 37:04.570
<i>- Hello.
- Dr McKenna?</i>

37:04.746 --> 37:06.371
This is Dr McKenna. Who's this?

37:06.540 --> 37:08.532
<i>If you tell even one word</i>

37:08.709 --> 37:12.541
<i>of what Louis Bernard whispered to you</i>

37:12.713 --> 37:15.286
<i>your little boy will be in serious danger.</i>

37:16.383 --> 37:19.384
<i>Remember, say nothing.</i>

37:23.974 --> 37:26.050
Hello?

37:33.066 --> 37:34.098
Drayton?

37:38.030 --> 37:41.233
<i>Didn't you tell me your wife was
going to take Hank back to the hotel?</i>

37:41.408 --> 37:43.566
- I thought so, yes.
- Call her up.

37:43.744 --> 37:45.653
Somebody just called me,
threatened me about Hank.

37:45.829 --> 37:48.700
Call her up, see if he's alright.

37:58.467 --> 38:00.543
Hotel Mamounia?

38:12.731 --> 38:15.269
Bien. Merci.

38:15.442 --> 38:19.736
My wife doesn't answer.

38:23.742 --> 38:26.862
<i>Concierge?</i>

38:38.757 --> 38:42.256
<i>Oh. Bien. Merci.</i>

38:43.178 --> 38:45.420
Oh, ye
- Uh...

38:45.597 --> 38:48.515
What's your room number?

38:48.684 --> 38:50.760
414.

39:02.489 --> 39:04.565
Bien. Merci.

39:05.242 --> 39:06.273
I can't believe it.

39:07.202 --> 39:12.327
- She hasn't come back yet, huh?
- At least, nobody's seen her.

39:13.166 --> 39:15.658
Alright, now you go back to the hotel.

39:15.836 --> 39:20.297
You
- And... see if you can find out what's going on.

39:20.465 --> 39:22.043
It's so unlike my wife.

39:22.217 --> 39:25.420
I'll take care of the police
and join you as soon as I can.

39:25.596 --> 39:26.971
Look here. Don't worry.

39:27.139 --> 39:29.464
It's probably some stupid misunderstanding.

39:29.641 --> 39:33.057
If I find anything out before you
get back, I'll telephone you here.

39:33.228 --> 39:35.802
- Don't waste any time.
- Goodbye.

39:42.779 --> 39:44.155
Who was it, Ben?

39:45.199 --> 39:47.487
It was the, uh...

39:47.659 --> 39:50.150
the, uh... concierge at the hotel.

39:50.329 --> 39:54.113
He found out we were
being held by the police.

39:54.291 --> 39:56.782
<i>He just called to see if
there was anything he could do.</i>

39:56.960 --> 40:00.329
- That's very nice of him.
- Yes, I thought so.

40:00.506 --> 40:02.878
I told him if we weren't
back there in 15 minutes,

40:03.050 --> 40:07.925
<i>for him to call the American
Consulate at Casablanca.</i>

40:08.680 --> 40:11.765
But, monsieur, if you had
only told me in the first place

40:11.934 --> 40:14.140
that you wished to consult with your consul.

40:14.311 --> 40:15.889
Yeah, yeah. Come on, Jo.

40:16.063 --> 40:18.518
There is just one small formality.

40:18.690 --> 40:21.608
I must request you to sign a statement.

40:21.777 --> 40:23.354
If it doesn't take too long, of course.

40:23.529 --> 40:27.194
Wait a moment. I will send for a typist.

40:34.122 --> 40:35.498
Ben?

40:37.292 --> 40:38.324
Yeah?

40:38.502 --> 40:41.456
Aren't you going to let me see the message?

40:41.630 --> 40:43.421
I don't
- I...

40:45.008 --> 40:47.297
I don't think I should.

40:47.469 --> 40:50.138
Darling, I'm not the police inspector.

40:50.305 --> 40:53.057
I think that I should see it.

41:03.777 --> 41:05.686
Ben, why didn't you give this to the police?

41:05.863 --> 41:07.855
<i>- Because I didn't want to.
- But, Ben, a man's life -</i>

41:08.031 --> 41:10.653
Is at stake, yeah I know.

41:10.826 --> 41:12.818
I just - I-I don't know
what's the right thing to do.

41:16.874 --> 41:21.085
We should go back to the hotel,
pick up Hank and get out of here.

41:21.253 --> 41:23.411
- Maybe.
- Think about Hank.

41:23.589 --> 41:25.047
What a terrible thing this is for him,

41:25.215 --> 41:27.753
seeing a man murdered right before his eyes.

41:27.926 --> 41:30.880
<i>- It's a horrible shock to a little boy.
- I know.</i>

41:31.054 --> 41:33.842
Why don't you take that note,
give it to the American Consulate,

41:34.016 --> 41:36.423
and let's not get any more involved, please.

41:49.823 --> 41:51.780
Why don't you get the key?
I'll take care of the driver.

41:51.950 --> 41:53.658
Alright.

42:00.751 --> 42:03.456
Say, uh... you know a Mrs Drayton?

42:03.629 --> 42:05.455
- English lady.
- That's right.

42:05.631 --> 42:09.463
Did you see her coming from the
marketplace in the last hour?

42:09.635 --> 42:13.300
- No, sir.
- Wait a minute. This is very important.

42:13.472 --> 42:17.552
- She had my little boy with her.
- No, sir.

42:17.726 --> 42:21.510
- What about Mr Drayton?
- Mr Drayton checked out.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.766
- He what?
- Checked out.

42:24.942 --> 42:27.397
- But he couldn't have.
- Yes, sir, he did.

42:27.569 --> 42:30.819
Mr Drayton, the Englishman with the horn
- rimmed glasses.

42:30.989 --> 42:33.361
<i>Yes, sir. He checked out.</i>

42:39.456 --> 42:42.374
I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted.

42:45.128 --> 42:47.964
I'll call Mrs Drayton, tell
her she can bring Hank back.

42:48.131 --> 42:50.457
- Just hold that call a minute, Jo.
- Why?

42:50.634 --> 42:53.588
Because I asked you to!

42:53.762 --> 42:57.213
Ben, are we about to have our monthly fight?

42:59.476 --> 43:01.303
I hope not.

43:01.478 --> 43:04.645
<i>Well, then stop acting like that.</i>

43:04.815 --> 43:07.484
<i>I merely said I was
going to call Mrs Drayton.</i>

43:07.651 --> 43:09.525
Just a minute.

43:09.695 --> 43:11.604
Wait a minute.

43:11.780 --> 43:14.022
Just a minute. Just a minute.

43:14.199 --> 43:17.034
I want you to take these. They'll relax you.

43:17.202 --> 43:20.405
Relax me? I'm so relaxed I'm tired.

43:20.581 --> 43:23.914
- Maybe you need them.
- These are for you, Jo.

43:24.084 --> 43:26.657
- I'm the doctor.
Here. - Ben -

43:26.837 --> 43:30.122
You know what happens when
you get excited and nervous.

43:30.299 --> 43:31.923
Here. Do me a favour.

43:32.092 --> 43:34.761
Six months ago you told
me I took too many pills.

43:34.928 --> 43:37.502
Six months ago you weren't
a witness to a murder.

43:37.681 --> 43:40.516
You've been excited. You've
been talking a blue streak.

43:40.684 --> 43:43.092
- You've been walking around in circles.
- I haven't!

43:43.270 --> 43:47.433
Jo, I make my living knowing when
and how to administer medicine.

43:47.608 --> 43:50.525
You'll feel better if you take these.

43:50.694 --> 43:53.944
You don't think you will
- I'll make a deal with you.

43:54.114 --> 43:56.237
We'll make a deal. What is this?

43:56.408 --> 43:59.113
There's something about this
Louis Bernard, the police station

43:59.286 --> 44:01.409
and this whole spy business
I haven't told you yet.

44:01.580 --> 44:03.869
- What?
- Here's the price of curiosity.

44:04.041 --> 44:06.413
- What is it?
- There's one way of finding out.

44:11.465 --> 44:15.332
Alright, Dr McKenna. I'm
now relaxed and listening.

44:15.511 --> 44:20.671
There's been something strange about
this whole thing from the very beginning.

44:20.849 --> 44:25.428
It wasn't any accident Louis Bernard
came up to us, helped us on the bus

44:25.604 --> 44:27.929
and started up a conversation.

44:28.106 --> 44:30.776
- You were right about him.
- You see there?

44:30.943 --> 44:32.651
I know. I know. That's what I said.

44:32.819 --> 44:35.227
You were right. He was strange.

44:35.405 --> 44:39.154
Yes, I know all that. But
what were you going to tell me?

44:39.326 --> 44:42.861
He started to talk to us,
and the reason he started

44:43.038 --> 44:46.489
was because he was on the lookout
for a suspicious married couple.

44:46.667 --> 44:49.786
There's nothing very
suspicious-looking about us, is there?

44:49.962 --> 44:54.789
No, because he was wrong. It
was a different married couple.

44:54.967 --> 44:57.540
Oh. And he was killed before he found them?

44:57.719 --> 45:00.970
No, he found them. He found them, all right.

45:01.139 --> 45:04.140
It was in the restaurant
where we had dinner last night.

45:04.309 --> 45:07.559
That's one of the reasons he was killed.

45:07.729 --> 45:10.102
You'll be telling me next
it's Mr and Mrs Drayton.

45:10.274 --> 45:12.350
That's who it was, Jo.

45:14.319 --> 45:17.439
Ben, if this is your idea of a
joke, it's not a very funny one.

45:20.742 --> 45:24.111
<i>- I think I'll lie down.
- Now, listen to me, Jo.</i>

45:24.288 --> 45:27.870
Now, listen to me very carefully.

45:28.041 --> 45:32.834
That phone call at the police station,
that wasn't the concierge at the hotel.

45:33.005 --> 45:35.756
<i>That was a man with a foreign voice.</i>

45:35.924 --> 45:40.551
He told me if I mentioned one single word
of what Bernard told me in the market,

45:40.721 --> 45:42.678
<i>that something would happen to Hank.</i>

45:42.848 --> 45:44.840
Hank? Why Hank?

45:45.017 --> 45:47.721
They've taken him away.

45:47.895 --> 45:51.727
But Mrs Drayton brought
him back to the hotel.

45:51.899 --> 45:55.065
Mrs Drayton never got back to
the hotel and neither did Hank.

45:55.235 --> 45:57.062
- But Mr Drayton
- - Listen, Jo.

45:57.237 --> 46:00.440
Mr Drayton checked out of
the hotel 40 minutes ago.

46:00.616 --> 46:02.442
Now, come on, Jo. Sit down.

46:02.618 --> 46:05.287
I could kill you! You gave me sedatives!

46:05.454 --> 46:08.324
- Sit down.
- You did! Let go!

46:08.498 --> 46:11.452
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wasn't sure.

46:11.627 --> 46:14.793
- You did! You did!
- Jo, please! Please!

46:14.963 --> 46:17.454
Let go of me! Let go!

46:17.633 --> 46:21.049
- Ben!
- Lie down, Jo.

46:21.220 --> 46:24.386
Oh, Ben, let me find my baby!

46:24.556 --> 46:26.513
Oh, dear God!

46:26.683 --> 46:29.887
- I want my boy!
- Jo, please.

46:30.062 --> 46:32.138
Ben, please. Oh, dear God!

46:32.314 --> 46:34.141
Where is he, Ben?

46:37.694 --> 46:39.486
Forgive me, Jo.

46:39.655 --> 46:41.528
Forgive me.

47:37.379 --> 47:39.751
There's still no word of him, Jo.

47:39.923 --> 47:43.292
<i>The Draytons are definitely gone.</i>

47:43.468 --> 47:46.090
<i>The register in the hotel
says they came from London.</i>

47:46.263 --> 47:49.050
<i>Drayton told the concierge
he was a college professor.</i>

47:49.224 --> 47:52.593
I don't think there's
anything we can do here, Jo.

47:52.769 --> 47:54.928
I can't bring the police in.

47:55.105 --> 47:57.774
<i>I'd even thought of taking that chance.</i>

47:57.941 --> 48:00.183
<i>But the minute they
connect Hank's disappearance</i>

48:00.360 --> 48:02.234
<i>with Louis Bernard's murder,</i>

48:02.404 --> 48:05.156
then the first thing they'll
do is make me tell them

48:05.324 --> 48:09.108
what Louis Bernard whispered
to me in the market place.

48:09.286 --> 48:12.121
<i>That won't do Hank any good.</i>

48:12.289 --> 48:14.328
<i>We're going to London.</i>

48:14.499 --> 48:18.200
The Draytons had a private
aeroplane. I found that out.

48:18.378 --> 48:21.048
That's how they got Hank out of here.

48:21.215 --> 48:24.548
<i>It could land anyplace, no
trouble with passports or anything.</i>

48:24.718 --> 48:27.387
So we're going to London to find him.

48:31.600 --> 48:35.811
Now, Jo... now listen to me.
This is what Bernard said.

48:35.979 --> 48:39.229
"A man, a statesman, is
to be killed, assassinated,

48:39.399 --> 48:41.606
in London soon, very soon.

48:41.777 --> 48:45.821
Tell them in London to
try Ambrose Chappell. "

48:45.989 --> 48:47.899
That's the fella we've got to find.

48:48.075 --> 48:52.701
If he knows anything, I'm gonna offer
him every penny I have to get Hank back.

48:52.871 --> 48:55.908
The Chappell guy's our only
hope. Do you understand?

48:56.083 --> 48:58.834
I've got a car waiting downstairs.

48:59.002 --> 49:02.917
I've paid the hotel bill. We
get packed, we'll be all set.

49:03.090 --> 49:05.166
Honey?

49:06.760 --> 49:11.802
We don't have much time. You'll
have to get up and get ready.

49:11.974 --> 49:14.050
Please, Jo.

49:15.269 --> 49:17.724
Please, Jo.

49:39.418 --> 49:41.624
Would you just wait, sir?

49:41.795 --> 49:44.630
<i>- Come this way.
- Jo! Love from the fan club!</i>

49:47.301 --> 49:49.589
How could they remember me so well, Ben?

49:49.761 --> 49:52.087
It's been four years since I played London.

49:52.264 --> 49:55.181
You're the kind of gal they don't forget.

49:55.350 --> 49:58.802
Who told them we were
coming? Ben, you didn't -

49:58.979 --> 50:03.855
I wired the Parnells to get us a hotel.
I never figured on anything like this.

50:10.240 --> 50:12.316
Dr and Mrs McKenna,

50:12.492 --> 50:15.696
I'm Inspector Edington of the
Criminal Investigation Department.

50:15.871 --> 50:20.284
As things are, there's no need for you
to go through customs. Come this way.

50:23.045 --> 50:24.836
<i>How about a photo, Jo?</i>

50:25.005 --> 50:26.380
<i>Hi, Jo!</i>

50:31.303 --> 50:33.379
This way, please.

50:33.555 --> 50:36.129
<i>We want Jo!</i>

50:40.187 --> 50:42.808
This is Mr Woburn. Dr and Mrs McKenna.

50:42.981 --> 50:45.472
- How do you do?
- What do you people want with us?

50:45.651 --> 50:49.150
- Mr Buchanan would like to talk to you.
- Who's he?

50:49.321 --> 50:51.729
Special Branch, Scotland Yard.

51:00.165 --> 51:02.490
This is Mr Buchanan. Dr and Mrs McKenna.

51:02.668 --> 51:06.037
How do you do? Thank you, Woburn.

51:06.213 --> 51:09.333
Do sit down, won't you?

51:09.508 --> 51:13.506
Let me say we're shocked that your
son was taken from you in Marrakech,

51:13.679 --> 51:15.506
<i>and deeply sympathetic.</i>

51:15.681 --> 51:18.432
- Do you know where he is?
- Have you heard anything?

51:18.600 --> 51:20.842
I only wish I could give
you some cheerful news,

51:21.019 --> 51:24.554
but we might find him quite
soon, indeed, if we work together.

51:24.731 --> 51:28.515
Bernard the Frenchman was
sent to Morocco at our request

51:28.694 --> 51:31.860
to check up on an assassination
plot here in London.

51:32.030 --> 51:37.273
<i>You know, a good agent keeps on
staking his life. He doesn't always win.</i>

51:37.452 --> 51:40.288
<i>Bernard reckoned you were a man to trust.</i>

51:40.455 --> 51:42.448
<i>He relied on you to come to us.</i>

51:42.624 --> 51:45.791
<i>Those people kidnapped your boy
in order to keep your mouth shut.</i>

51:47.796 --> 51:52.292
- That's right, isn't it?
- No, I think they took him for money.

51:52.467 --> 51:56.880
<i>Why didn't you go to your consulate
in Casablanca? Why come to London?</i>

51:57.055 --> 51:59.131
- Well, I...
- Mr Buchanan -

51:59.308 --> 52:01.300
<i>You're convinced these people
brought your son to London.</i>

52:01.476 --> 52:04.513
You're convinced you can
find him off your own bat.

52:04.688 --> 52:06.930
<i>You can't. It's impossible.</i>

52:07.107 --> 52:10.441
But with the help we can
give you, there's a chance.

52:10.611 --> 52:13.730
<i>- A really good chance.
- But they told us not to say anything.</i>

52:13.906 --> 52:17.025
Anything you tell me will be
in the most absolute confidence.

52:17.201 --> 52:19.158
Yes, that may be true, but -

52:19.328 --> 52:21.949
<i>Your son is the trump card these people hold.</i>

52:22.122 --> 52:23.996
He's perfectly safe for the moment.

52:24.166 --> 52:27.001
When they've done what they
want, they'll let him go.

52:27.169 --> 52:29.327
Are we supposed to just sit and wait?

52:29.505 --> 52:34.961
If they consider your boy a
nuisance, afterwards, I'm afraid...

52:35.135 --> 52:38.884
There's no need for you to
try and scare us, Mr Buchanan.

52:39.056 --> 52:42.507
That's exactly what I am trying to do
- scare you.

52:42.684 --> 52:46.812
<i>I'm trying to prevent a man
being murdered here in London.</i>

52:46.980 --> 52:49.103
If you don't tell me all you know,

52:49.274 --> 52:51.765
you become an accessory
before the fact of murder.

52:51.944 --> 52:56.321
- Ben, what can we do by ourselves?
- Now, wait just a minute.

52:56.490 --> 52:58.317
You've been working on the wrong McKenna.

52:58.492 --> 53:02.157
- Bernard talked to me, not my wife.
- Then, you tell me.

53:02.329 --> 53:06.457
He spoke to me in French. I
don't understand a word of it.

53:06.625 --> 53:09.330
Oh, Ben, maybe they could find those people

53:09.503 --> 53:11.330
Maybe's not good enough for me.

53:11.505 --> 53:13.663
I don't think it ought
to be good enough for you.

53:13.841 --> 53:16.676
- You're not the only one concerned
- - I didn't mean it that way.

53:16.844 --> 53:20.426
We made up our minds what we're
gonna do. Let's stick to it.

53:22.224 --> 53:25.178
I'm sorry, Mr Buchanan, we...

53:25.352 --> 53:29.564
we'd like to cooperate with you
on this thing, but we just can't.

53:29.731 --> 53:32.104
<i>I've got a son of my own.</i>

53:33.777 --> 53:35.686
<i>I don't know what I'd do.</i>

53:35.863 --> 53:37.939
Excuse me.

53:45.706 --> 53:48.410
Telephone call for you, Mrs McKenna.

53:50.335 --> 53:54.582
Put the telephone call for Mrs
McKenna through here please.

54:01.346 --> 54:03.672
<i>- Hello.
- Mrs McKenna?</i>

54:03.849 --> 54:07.847
<i>- Yes.
- This is Mrs Drayton. Remember me?</i>

54:08.020 --> 54:09.847
Mrs Drayton.

54:10.022 --> 54:12.939
Where is our son? Where have you got him?

54:16.111 --> 54:19.527
<i>He's here with me. You
mustn't worry about him.</i>

54:19.698 --> 54:22.106
Where's our son? Where have you got him?

54:22.284 --> 54:24.775
<i>I expect you'd like to speak to him.</i>

54:24.953 --> 54:27.705
Yes, please. Please.

54:28.916 --> 54:33.412
<i>- Hank! Hello, Hank!
- Just a minute.</i>

54:36.798 --> 54:39.289
<i>Mommy? Mommy, is that you?</i>

54:39.468 --> 54:42.967
Oh, Hank darling, are you really all right?

54:43.138 --> 54:47.884
<i>I'm a little scared, Mommy,
but I'm all right, I guess.</i>

54:48.060 --> 54:51.974
<i>I miss you, Mommy. I miss you so much!</i>

54:52.147 --> 54:56.441
Oh, here. Hank. Hank, this is Daddy.

54:56.610 --> 54:59.777
<i>- Is Mommy crying?
- Hank, listen to me.</i>

54:59.947 --> 55:04.324
Where are you? Where are you?

55:04.493 --> 55:09.570
<i>I didn't mean to make her cry, Daddy,
but I'm scared and I want to see her.</i>

55:09.748 --> 55:14.125
Hank, now listen to me. Tell me
- where are you?

55:15.921 --> 55:18.673
<i>- Welbeck, eight...
- Yeah?</i>

55:18.841 --> 55:21.296
<i>Eight? Come on, Hank.</i>

55:21.468 --> 55:23.295
Hank!

55:36.358 --> 55:39.063
Ben, he was so scared.

55:45.826 --> 55:48.495
It was a London telephone exchange.

55:48.662 --> 55:51.283
Public call box
- West One.

55:51.456 --> 55:54.991
Do I have to say any more? Come on, dear.

55:55.169 --> 55:57.742
You may change your minds.

55:58.839 --> 56:00.748
If you do...

56:02.384 --> 56:04.957
this number will find me.

56:10.184 --> 56:13.220
<i>Baggage for Air France flight 592.</i>

56:23.071 --> 56:24.945
- Everything all right, sir?
- Yeah, yeah.

56:25.115 --> 56:27.024
- Your room key.
- Thank you.

56:27.201 --> 56:29.526
Oh, uh, here.

56:29.703 --> 56:31.779
- Thank you, sir.
- There you are.

56:31.955 --> 56:34.909
It's from the Parnells. 'Welcome home, Jo.

56:35.083 --> 56:39.033
Look forward to seeing your family, especially the little
-"

56:50.390 --> 56:54.056
'With love, from Jan and
Cindy. " That's very nice.

57:00.609 --> 57:02.602
"Ambrose Chappell. "

57:02.778 --> 57:08.448
<i>There he is, big as life. "61
Burdett Street, Camden Town,</i>

57:08.617 --> 57:11.322
<i>Gulliver 6198."</i>

57:11.495 --> 57:13.322
What are you going to say?

57:13.497 --> 57:18.836
That I'll keep my mouth shut and
offer him all the money we have.

57:19.002 --> 57:21.244
Operator?

57:21.421 --> 57:26.048
<i>Operator, I want Gulliver 6198.</i>

57:26.218 --> 57:28.970
<i>I'll get it.</i>

57:32.182 --> 57:33.760
Jo! Oh, you look wonderful!

57:33.934 --> 57:36.603
When we got your wire, I couldn't believe it.

57:36.770 --> 57:39.344
<i>- What were you doing in Morocco?
- Sightseeing.</i>

57:39.523 --> 57:44.315
You're the perfect answer to what
London needs, Jo. This week's so dull.

57:44.486 --> 57:45.601
<i>Ambrose Chappell?</i>

57:45.779 --> 57:47.523
Mr Ambrose Chappell?

57:47.698 --> 57:49.856
Oh, Mr Conway, I didn't know you were there.

57:50.033 --> 57:53.283
McKenna! Dr McKenna. Welcome
to London town, Doctor.

57:53.453 --> 57:55.991
<i>I knew you were married, but a doctor?</i>

57:56.164 --> 57:58.834
How clever. Especially in
such a psychosomatic business.

57:59.001 --> 58:04.042
Jan, be quiet. You wouldn't
know what psychosomatic means.

58:04.214 --> 58:06.670
It's when your mind gets sick of your body.

58:06.842 --> 58:11.468
<i>- The doctor's trying to telephone.
- No, no. It's just some business.</i>

58:11.638 --> 58:15.138
Business is everything. Shh.

58:15.309 --> 58:18.345
<i>Hello. Hello? Ambrose Chappell.</i>

58:18.520 --> 58:21.094
I say, is this Mr Ambrose Chappell?

58:21.273 --> 58:23.598
<i>My name's McKenna.</i>

58:23.775 --> 58:26.445
Dr Benjamin McKenna.

58:28.447 --> 58:30.736
We don't need to be quiet. How about a drink?

58:30.908 --> 58:34.158
<i>I was wondering if you'd be
at your address for a while.</i>

58:34.328 --> 58:37.613
I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes.

58:37.789 --> 58:39.865
Thank you. I'll be right over.

58:41.543 --> 58:43.619
I'd like all of you to meet my husband.

58:43.795 --> 58:46.713
I've heard so much about you.
It's nice to see you in person.

58:46.882 --> 58:49.373
This is Val's wife, Helen.

58:49.551 --> 58:53.929
You look just like those pictures
Jo had. Haven't changed a bit.

58:54.097 --> 58:57.301
<i>Why should he? He's a doctor.
Probably gets free hormones.</i>

58:57.476 --> 59:01.224
I'm Jan Peterson. I sing
almost as well as your wife.

59:01.396 --> 59:04.433
And this is Cindy Fontaine
from Harrisburg, PA.

59:04.608 --> 59:07.181
Oh, Harrisburg. Been back home lately?

59:07.361 --> 59:09.982
How can I? They know me there as Elva McDuff.

59:10.155 --> 59:12.231
It doesn't quite fit me any more.

59:12.407 --> 59:15.077
<i>Where's your boy? I'd like to see
which one of you he looks like.</i>

59:15.244 --> 59:19.111
He's staying with some other people
so we could have some time alone.

59:19.289 --> 59:22.575
<i>- What's his name?
- Hank. Henry, really.</i>

59:22.751 --> 59:27.247
<i>I hope he looks like you
and has the doctor's brains.</i>

59:27.422 --> 59:29.380
These flowers are lovely -

59:29.550 --> 59:31.589
Well, I'll order some drinks.

59:31.760 --> 59:34.796
OK, but dinner tonight's on
me, a "welcome home" for Jo.

59:34.972 --> 59:38.222
<i>I wish I could persuade her to stay a month.</i>

59:38.392 --> 59:41.097
I'm terribly sorry, but
I have an appointment.

59:41.270 --> 59:45.184
I wonder if you'd order the drinks.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

59:45.357 --> 59:48.026
- Excuse me, please.
- Ben, please.

59:48.193 --> 59:50.186
- Ben...
- It's got to be done.

59:50.362 --> 59:53.280
- Take me with you.
- I can't. I won't disappear.

59:53.448 --> 59:57.778
- Please let me go with you.
- Two are easier to follow than one.

59:57.953 --> 01:00:00.361
We don't want Buchanan's men
or the others on our tracks.

01:00:00.539 --> 01:00:02.781
I'm going out through the service entrance.

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:56.747
- Yes, sir?
- Ambrose Chappell?

01:02:56.924 --> 01:02:59.000
Come in.

01:03:05.807 --> 01:03:08.512
There's a gent to see you, sir.

01:03:15.484 --> 01:03:18.651
Good afternoon, sir. I am Ambrose Chappell.

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:20.897
What can I do for you?

01:03:21.073 --> 01:03:23.646
Well, I
- I, uh -

01:03:23.825 --> 01:03:27.159
If you gave me your name,
that might be a start.

01:03:27.329 --> 01:03:31.161
My name is McKenna. Dr Benjamin McKenna.

01:03:31.333 --> 01:03:33.824
- I phoned you.
- Oh, yes, yes.

01:03:34.002 --> 01:03:37.336
<i>You are Ambrose Chappell?</i>

01:03:37.506 --> 01:03:41.206
Well, I've been Ambrose
Chappell for nearly 71 years.

01:03:41.385 --> 01:03:44.421
But, uh... I think I understand your problem.

01:03:44.596 --> 01:03:46.505
- You do, huh?
- Certainly.

01:03:46.682 --> 01:03:50.347
It happens all the time.
You expected someone else?

01:03:50.519 --> 01:03:53.722
Just a moment. Ambrose?

01:03:57.484 --> 01:04:01.352
<i>I think this gentleman wants to talk to us.</i>

01:04:06.201 --> 01:04:09.368
Now, Father, why don't you
go and have a nice rest?

01:04:09.538 --> 01:04:13.073
Hm? I have centuries of
rest ahead of me, thank you.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:16.085
Good day to you, sir.

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:19.207
- Now, what can I do for you?
- I'm Dr McKenna.

01:04:20.632 --> 01:04:25.627
- That name mean anything to you?
- No. No, I don't think so.

01:04:25.804 --> 01:04:28.046
You've no idea why I'm here?

01:04:29.725 --> 01:04:32.560
My dear sir, I haven't the faintest idea.

01:04:32.728 --> 01:04:37.769
But your name was given to me
by someone I met in Marrakech.

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:42.021
- Oh, yes?
- Yes, and I think you know this man.

01:04:42.196 --> 01:04:47.154
- Louis Bernard, a Frenchman.
- Louis Bernard?

01:04:47.326 --> 01:04:52.320
Let's stop fooling around. Bernard told
me to come here just before he died.

01:04:53.373 --> 01:04:56.327
This man is... dead?

01:04:56.502 --> 01:04:58.126
You know he's dead just as well as I do.

01:04:58.295 --> 01:05:03.040
Now, I have a business proposition.
I don't see how you can turn it down.

01:05:09.348 --> 01:05:14.508
- Exactly what had you in mind?
- Well er... You want to talk here?

01:05:14.686 --> 01:05:17.474
Certainly. We have no
secrets from our employees.

01:05:19.024 --> 01:05:21.182
OK, now, in the first place,

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.108
I haven't uttered a word of what Bernard
told me before he died, and I never will.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.400
<i>Frankly, I'm not interested
in political intrigue.</i>

01:05:28.575 --> 01:05:31.493
I don't care who you fellows
are gonna kill in London.

01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:35.790
All I want's that boy, and I'll take
the next aeroplane back to America.

01:05:35.958 --> 01:05:38.875
Come on, please. Listen to me, will ya?

01:05:39.044 --> 01:05:42.627
Honestly, if money means
anything to you, I'll do...

01:05:42.798 --> 01:05:46.214
Father, call the police.
Shall we go into this -

01:05:46.385 --> 01:05:49.884
Wait a minute. You told
him to call the police.

01:05:50.055 --> 01:05:53.424
- What's the idea, trying
to bluff me? - My dear sir -

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.803
- And you don't know Louis Bernard?
- Never heard of him.

01:05:56.979 --> 01:06:00.229
You've got no idea what happened
in Marrakech and where my boy is?

01:06:00.399 --> 01:06:01.727
- No.
- Where is he?

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.142
William! Edgar! Davis! Help!

01:06:06.154 --> 01:06:08.824
Now, wait a minute! Wait! Hold on.

01:06:08.991 --> 01:06:13.285
It's obvious I'm in the wrong
place. Now, let go of me.

01:06:16.123 --> 01:06:18.578
Come on. Listen to me.

01:06:20.836 --> 01:06:22.912
Wait.

01:06:27.092 --> 01:06:30.176
I made a mistake. Now, let me go.

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:40.843
Hold him! Hold him!

01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:46.942
Ouch!

01:06:47.112 --> 01:06:49.354
Hold him. Hold him.

01:06:56.622 --> 01:06:58.828
He said that even if Bud
Flanagan was dressed by Hartnell,

01:06:58.999 --> 01:07:01.455
nobody would believe he was an aristocrat.

01:07:01.627 --> 01:07:04.034
So I said, "Listen, Chris,

01:07:04.213 --> 01:07:08.045
why don't you take William
Hickey's column out of the paper?

01:07:08.217 --> 01:07:11.550
Jo? Jo, what's become of that
unpredictable husband of yours?

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.878
He's been gone over an hour now.

01:07:14.056 --> 01:07:18.848
- He went to see some man. Church?
- No, it was Chappell.

01:07:26.068 --> 01:07:28.737
It's not a man. It's a place.

01:07:31.782 --> 01:07:34.403
It's Ambrose Chapel!

01:07:34.576 --> 01:07:37.910
- Do they list chapels in the directory?
- Let's take a look.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.653
Please help me find it.

01:07:40.832 --> 01:07:44.581
Let's see. Here we are. Ambrose...

01:07:44.753 --> 01:07:48.537
Ambrose and Chafer... Ambrose
Chapel! 17 Ambrose Street, W2.

01:07:48.715 --> 01:07:51.004
17 Ambrose Street, W2.

01:07:51.176 --> 01:07:53.667
17 Ambrose Street, W2.

01:07:53.846 --> 01:07:56.337
17 Ambrose Street.

01:07:57.766 --> 01:08:00.174
Look, darlings, I have to go.

01:08:00.352 --> 01:08:03.555
<i>I'm very sorry. Have another drink.
I'll be back as soon as I can.</i>

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:06.138
And explain to Ben when
he comes in, would you?

01:08:06.316 --> 01:08:08.986
<i>Explain what?</i>

01:08:24.209 --> 01:08:27.328
Look, there's something
weird going on here and I -

01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:30.209
Let's try to figure the whole thing
out. First, there was a man named -

01:08:30.381 --> 01:08:32.872
- Ambrose Chappell.
- And Ben dashed off to see him.

01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:35.886
Then Jo said it wasn't a man
but a place and she dashed off.

01:08:36.054 --> 01:08:38.545
Don't mention it again, or I might dash off.

01:08:38.724 --> 01:08:41.215
- What a temptation.
- Can you fathom it?

01:08:41.393 --> 01:08:46.055
<i>It's probably some new American gag.</i>

01:08:47.232 --> 01:08:50.233
<i>- Well, hello again.
- Oh.</i>

01:08:50.402 --> 01:08:54.020
I'm awfully sorry I had to rush off,
but there was something I had to do.

01:08:54.198 --> 01:08:56.948
Oh, boy, I could use this.

01:08:57.117 --> 01:09:01.162
Thank you. Well, I
- Where's Jo?

01:09:01.330 --> 01:09:04.496
- She's gone to Ambrose Chapel.
- I just came from there.

01:09:04.666 --> 01:09:08.249
- Not your Ambrose Chappell.
- It isn't a he, it's a building.

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.171
<i>She just left 20 minutes ago.</i>

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:14.756
She... What? What do you mean?

01:09:14.926 --> 01:09:18.509
- Where's the address?
- I'll look it up again.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.846
What is this? You say it's a building?

01:09:22.017 --> 01:09:24.555
Ambrose Chapel, 17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.

01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:26.602
17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.

01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:33.814
Yes? Doctor! Doctor, come back! It's Jo.

01:09:38.158 --> 01:09:40.863
- Jo?
- Ben? What happened?

01:09:41.036 --> 01:09:45.947
- No. It was a wild-goose chase. -
It must be the chapel. I've found it.

01:09:46.124 --> 01:09:48.995
<i>It's just a short way from here.</i>

01:09:49.169 --> 01:09:51.791
I know the address. I'll be right over.

01:09:51.964 --> 01:09:53.209
I'll meet you outside.

01:09:53.381 --> 01:09:56.003
Bye, dear. What did you say the address was?

01:09:56.176 --> 01:09:58.548
17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.009
I don't know how to thank you.

01:10:58.447 --> 01:11:02.147
Three men. You don't know
much about checkers, do you?

01:11:02.326 --> 01:11:05.196
You'd better go to bed,
or you'll be overtired.

01:11:05.370 --> 01:11:07.493
Can I finish? I'm winning.

01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:11.532
Yes, finish. Edna, see he
has some milk and biscuits.

01:11:11.710 --> 01:11:14.746
He'd better be put to sleep.
I've got to get downstairs.

01:11:14.922 --> 01:11:19.169
No, it's not necessary tonight.
You'll sleep, Hank, won't you?

01:11:19.343 --> 01:11:23.175
- I guess so.
- Oh, hurry up, if you want to finish this.

01:11:23.347 --> 01:11:26.763
Look, it doesn't hurt to be kind, does it?

01:11:28.143 --> 01:11:32.141
Give me a yell when you
want me to unlock the door.

01:11:42.157 --> 01:11:45.111
<i>- Can I come in?
- Yes.</i>

01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:13.387
I wish it was tomorrow.

01:12:13.564 --> 01:12:16.564
That's not a very orthodox sentiment.

01:12:18.819 --> 01:12:21.440
Ah, before I forget.

01:12:21.613 --> 01:12:23.606
Here you are, my friend.

01:12:23.782 --> 01:12:28.361
Two tickets for the concert at the
Albert Hall, with my compliments.

01:12:28.537 --> 01:12:30.695
Your box is nicely placed.

01:12:30.873 --> 01:12:33.494
<i>Or, should we say, strategically placed.</i>

01:12:33.667 --> 01:12:37.001
- And now for the most important part.
- What is it?

01:12:37.171 --> 01:12:40.088
A record of the delightful
piece they're going to play.

01:12:40.257 --> 01:12:43.708
<i>Music's less in your line than marksmanship.</i>

01:12:43.886 --> 01:12:48.880
If you listen, I'm going to play you
the exact moment when you can shoot.

01:12:49.057 --> 01:12:51.050
So listen carefully.

01:12:51.226 --> 01:12:54.844
<i># Finding...</i>

01:12:56.523 --> 01:13:00.106
<i># Release!</i>

01:13:00.277 --> 01:13:04.986
We'll have it once more. Listen
for the crash of the cymbals.

01:13:05.157 --> 01:13:08.526
<i># Finding...</i>

01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:14.320
<i># Release! #</i>

01:13:17.878 --> 01:13:22.207
You see? At such a moment,
your shot will never be heard.

01:13:22.382 --> 01:13:24.708
Even the listeners will be undisturbed.

01:13:24.885 --> 01:13:29.262
I think the composer would've
appreciated that. No-one will know.

01:13:30.182 --> 01:13:36.220
<i>- No-one except one. - That's
right, if you're clever, my friend.</i>

01:13:36.396 --> 01:13:40.394
- Any questions, musical or otherwise?
- No.

01:13:40.567 --> 01:13:44.067
There's one comforting thought
- it happens early in the evening.

01:13:44.238 --> 01:13:48.781
I hope I shan't upset you if I tell
you you've only time for one shot.

01:13:48.951 --> 01:13:52.154
- If you need another, the risk is yours.
- I don't take risks.

01:13:52.329 --> 01:13:54.487
I'm very glad to hear that.

01:13:54.665 --> 01:13:58.365
Traipsing all the way to Marrakech for
you, I should like you to do me credit.

01:13:58.544 --> 01:14:01.829
Your distinguished target
is already on his way.

01:14:02.005 --> 01:14:05.339
There's a car waiting for you
downstairs in the back entrance.

01:14:05.509 --> 01:14:10.171
You're to pick up a Miss Benson on
the way. She'll be your companion.

01:14:10.347 --> 01:14:14.594
She'll lend you an air of
respectability, if that's possible.

01:14:14.768 --> 01:14:18.303
Will you have the money when I return?

01:14:19.857 --> 01:14:22.015
Don't you trust me?

01:14:23.026 --> 01:14:25.268
What is your English proverb?

01:14:25.445 --> 01:14:27.983
"A wolf in sheep's clothing. "

01:14:28.156 --> 01:14:32.617
<i>A very clever disguise, I must say.</i>

01:14:32.786 --> 01:14:36.998
I think you'd better be going. It's
impolite to be late for a concert.

01:14:37.165 --> 01:14:42.456
And it would be awkward if they made
you wait until the first item was over.

01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:46.294
- Will you show our friend to the car?
- Yes, of course.

01:14:46.466 --> 01:14:51.508
I'm sorry you have to sneak out, but
we must preserve a respectable front.

01:15:01.815 --> 01:15:05.314
<i># Finding...</i>

01:15:07.154 --> 01:15:09.859
<i># Release! #</i>

01:15:42.331 --> 01:15:43.956
There it is.

01:15:46.419 --> 01:15:50.713
Yeah. You just may have
hit it right on the nose.

01:15:50.882 --> 01:15:54.001
You can't be farther wrong than I was.

01:15:54.176 --> 01:15:56.964
- Let's go.
- Should we get help from the police?

01:15:57.138 --> 01:16:01.005
No, honey, please. Let's
take a crack at this alone.

01:16:18.075 --> 01:16:22.987
<i># Portents abound</i>

01:16:23.956 --> 01:16:26.661
<i># That earth</i>

01:16:26.834 --> 01:16:29.954
<i># And heav'n</i>

01:16:30.129 --> 01:16:32.881
<i># Amaze</i>

01:16:33.049 --> 01:16:35.966
<i># Wherefore</i>

01:16:36.135 --> 01:16:39.302
<i># Do earthquakes</i>

01:16:39.472 --> 01:16:44.300
<i># Cleave the ground?</i>

01:16:44.477 --> 01:16:50.017
<i># Why hides the sun</i>

01:16:50.191 --> 01:16:55.434
<i># In shame?</i>

01:16:55.613 --> 01:16:58.946
<i># Let sin no more...</i>

01:16:59.116 --> 01:17:01.275
- Ben.
- Ssh, ssh!

01:17:01.452 --> 01:17:07.039
<i># My soul enslave</i>

01:17:07.208 --> 01:17:10.375
<i># Break now...</i>

01:17:10.545 --> 01:17:16.499
<i># This is just another wild goose chase</i>

01:17:16.676 --> 01:17:20.376
<i>- # O save me
- # Let's wait -</i>

01:17:20.555 --> 01:17:24.967
<i>- # Whom Thou camst
- # And look around</i>

01:17:25.142 --> 01:17:28.558
<i># To save</i>

01:17:28.729 --> 01:17:31.481
<i># Nor bleed</i>

01:17:31.649 --> 01:17:38.814
<i>- # Nor die in vain
- # Look who's coming down the aisle</i>

01:17:40.992 --> 01:17:43.280
<i># From whence</i>

01:17:43.452 --> 01:17:45.825
<i># These dire</i>

01:17:45.997 --> 01:17:51.418
<i># Portents abound?</i>

01:17:51.586 --> 01:17:56.710
<i># That earth and heav'n</i>

01:17:56.883 --> 01:18:00.465
<i># Amaze</i>

01:18:00.636 --> 01:18:03.839

<i># Do earthquakes</i>

01:18:07.518 --> 01:18:12.346
<i># Cleave the ground?</i>

01:18:12.523 --> 01:18:15.560
<i># Why hides</i>

01:18:15.735 --> 01:18:18.570
<i># The sun</i>

01:18:26.329 --> 01:18:29.365
<i># Let sin</i>

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.865

<i># My soul enslave</i>

01:18:37.298 --> 01:18:40.215
<i># Break now</i>

01:18:40.384 --> 01:18:46.257
<i># The tyrant's chain</i>

01:18:46.432 --> 01:18:50.382
<i># O save me</i>

01:18:50.561 --> 01:18:55.188
<i># Whom Thou camst</i>

01:18:55.358 --> 01:18:58.727
<i># To save</i>

01:18:58.903 --> 01:19:01.572
<i># Nor bleed</i>

01:19:01.739 --> 01:19:04.859
<i># Nor die</i>

01:19:05.034 --> 01:19:09.661
<i># In vain #</i>

01:19:16.671 --> 01:19:21.498
The subject of my address to
you this evening is adversity.

01:19:21.676 --> 01:19:24.879
<i>The average life, yours and mine,</i>

01:19:25.054 --> 01:19:27.806
<i>is often harassed and perplexed</i>

01:19:27.974 --> 01:19:30.844
<i>by disappointments and by cruelties</i>

01:19:31.018 --> 01:19:33.426
<i>beyond our control.</i>

01:19:33.604 --> 01:19:38.350
<i>Now, strangely enough, it is often
these things beyond our control...</i>

01:19:38.526 --> 01:19:40.851
<i>That's Buchanan's number.</i>

01:19:41.028 --> 01:19:45.026
Go out, call him up, tell him to
surround this place with police.

01:19:45.199 --> 01:19:49.363
- What if he asks me
- - Tell him anything.

01:19:49.537 --> 01:19:53.451
This is the time. I'm sure
Hank's round here someplace.

01:19:55.334 --> 01:19:59.996
- But I don't want to leave you.
- I don't know how else to do it, honey.

01:20:00.172 --> 01:20:02.628
You go on now.

01:20:03.926 --> 01:20:05.718
<i>...our own goodness,</i>

01:20:05.887 --> 01:20:09.386
<i>and therefore the goodness of all mankind.</i>

01:20:17.815 --> 01:20:20.816
<i>Few of us pause</i>

01:20:20.985 --> 01:20:24.021
to consider how life's
adversities work in our behalf

01:20:24.197 --> 01:20:26.734
to make better men and women of us.

01:20:26.908 --> 01:20:29.992
But I think we should pause, and pause now,

01:20:30.161 --> 01:20:34.490
to do a little stocktaking, to
look into our own hearts and lives

01:20:34.665 --> 01:20:37.785
and see what we find there.

01:20:39.045 --> 01:20:41.832
Therefore, instead of continuing the service,

01:20:42.006 --> 01:20:44.923
I think we should all return to our homes

01:20:45.092 --> 01:20:49.589
<i>for private meditation, remembering
how little we have to complain of</i>

01:20:49.764 --> 01:20:52.433
<i>and how much to be grateful for.</i>

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:56.514
Next week, I shall discuss
the fruits of our meditations.

01:20:56.687 --> 01:21:00.555
Until then, my blessing upon
each and every one of you.

01:22:07.174 --> 01:22:09.547
This is a pleasant surprise, Doctor.

01:22:09.719 --> 01:22:11.842
Where's my boy, Drayton?

01:22:12.013 --> 01:22:13.756
He's upstairs.

01:22:13.931 --> 01:22:17.016
You've come just in time to
help my wife with his food.

01:22:17.185 --> 01:22:20.435
It seems Hank doesn't care
for our English cooking.

01:22:20.605 --> 01:22:22.396
What do you want?

01:22:22.565 --> 01:22:25.649
I'll give you money, keep my
mouth shut. All I want's my boy.

01:22:25.818 --> 01:22:30.895
And what about your wife? Did she go
outside just to get some fresh air?

01:22:31.073 --> 01:22:33.280
Tell me what you want. I'll do anything.

01:22:33.451 --> 01:22:37.283
All right. You'll see
your boy. All in good time.

01:22:37.455 --> 01:22:40.824
Hank! Hank McKenna!

01:22:42.168 --> 01:22:43.710
<i>Daddy?</i>

01:22:43.878 --> 01:22:47.128
<i>Daddy! I'm here, Daddy!</i>

01:22:47.298 --> 01:22:49.421
<i>I'm here!</i>

01:23:04.774 --> 01:23:07.016
My husband's there now, watching them.

01:23:07.193 --> 01:23:10.229
He sent me to call you so you could
do something before they get away.

01:23:10.404 --> 01:23:12.231
It isn't as easy as all that.

01:23:12.406 --> 01:23:17.282
My husband is in that chapel
waiting for me to bring help.

01:23:17.453 --> 01:23:21.747
May I speak to Mr Buchanan? He
told me to call him if I needed him.

01:23:21.916 --> 01:23:24.786
I'm awfully sorry. I can't
get in touch with him.

01:23:24.961 --> 01:23:27.962
He's at an important diplomatic
affair at the Albert Hall.

01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:30.289
Then call him there! Please call him.

01:23:30.466 --> 01:23:33.004
He's on his way. I don't know how -

01:23:33.177 --> 01:23:36.214
Mr Woburn, it isn't a matter of
days, it's a matter of minutes.

01:23:36.389 --> 01:23:39.639
Now, you've got to send
the police right away!

01:23:39.809 --> 01:23:43.427
- Or do I have to go to Albert Hall myself?
-  That won't be necessary.

01:23:43.604 --> 01:23:46.439
I'll have the chapel put
under immediate observation.

01:23:46.607 --> 01:23:50.023
By the time you get back, a
police car should be there.

01:23:50.194 --> 01:23:53.065
Tell your husband to come out
and let the police take over.

01:23:53.239 --> 01:23:56.156
Woburn, Special Branch. Hold
on. I must ring off, Mrs McKenna.

01:23:56.325 --> 01:23:59.362
Please believe me. I'll
have everything laid on.

01:24:30.401 --> 01:24:32.394
There's nobody there.

01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:35.322
- Are you Mrs McKenna?
- Yes. There's something wrong, officer.

01:24:35.489 --> 01:24:37.648
That place was full of people a few
minutes ago and now there's no-one.

01:24:37.825 --> 01:24:41.324
We are to keep it under observation
until the Scotland Yard car arrives.

01:24:41.495 --> 01:24:44.496
But my husband is in there.
There were 30 or 40 people -

01:24:44.665 --> 01:24:47.500
- When was this?
- No more than five minutes ago.

01:24:47.668 --> 01:24:50.835
- Hm, let's take a look.
- I've tried the door. It's locked.

01:24:51.005 --> 01:24:52.962
We'll have to force it open.

01:24:53.132 --> 01:24:55.421
I'm sorry, madam. We can't break in.

01:24:55.593 --> 01:24:58.594
- Requires a search warrant.
- Well, can't we get one?

01:24:58.763 --> 01:25:02.511
That all takes time. We'll
have a look around, shall we?

01:25:02.683 --> 01:25:05.601
Matthews, take the other end.

01:25:31.546 --> 01:25:35.626
<i>- There's no-one there. - Are you
certain this place was just full?</i>

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.418
Of course I'm certain. I was
there myself with my husband.

01:25:39.595 --> 01:25:42.845
He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.

01:25:44.475 --> 01:25:47.476
I'm afraid it's much too
complicated to explain why.

01:25:47.645 --> 01:25:51.228
We'll just have to sit tight and
wait for the car from The Yard.

01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:00.900
- There's no sign of life.
- Report back here.

01:26:01.075 --> 01:26:04.444
Very good, sir. Walden, you stand by
and wait for the car from The Yard.

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:06.613
- That's all, Matthews.
- You're not leaving?

01:26:06.789 --> 01:26:10.158
Orders, madam. Can we
give you a lift somewhere?

01:26:10.334 --> 01:26:13.584
- Take me to Albert Hall, please.
- The Albert Hall's off our beat.

01:26:13.754 --> 01:26:17.752
Suppose we drop you off
at the nearest taxi rank?

01:27:35.753 --> 01:27:37.829
Wait here.

01:27:43.719 --> 01:27:47.219
- They're here.
- Wait till I clear the kitchen.

01:27:57.817 --> 01:28:01.067
Everybody out! Into the
corridor. Five minutes.

01:28:01.237 --> 01:28:03.064
Come on!

01:28:03.239 --> 01:28:06.074
Do as he tells you. Come
on. It'll only take a minute.

01:28:06.242 --> 01:28:08.911
Come on. All of you, out.

01:28:27.305 --> 01:28:29.381
All right. This way.

01:28:31.976 --> 01:28:34.645
Always something funny
going on at this embassy.

01:28:34.812 --> 01:28:38.430
- Bringing people in in secret.
- Give me the Swiss embassy anytime.

01:28:38.608 --> 01:28:40.766
There's neutrality for you.

01:30:01.566 --> 01:30:03.724
Please, may I see the manager?

01:30:03.901 --> 01:30:06.571
I'm sorry, madam. The
manager's on duty in the lobby.

01:30:06.737 --> 01:30:10.023
- So is his assistant.
- I must speak with them.

01:30:10.199 --> 01:30:12.821
Over there somewhere.

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:39.184
You have a very nice little boy, madam.

01:30:39.353 --> 01:30:43.268
<i>His safety will depend upon you tonight.</i>

01:30:43.441 --> 01:30:46.395
Where is he? Where is he?

01:30:58.206 --> 01:31:00.245
Good evening.

01:31:00.416 --> 01:31:03.287
<i>- Is that the prime minister?
- No, the ambassador.</i>

01:31:03.461 --> 01:31:06.415
<i>His prime minister's the
one with the bald head.</i>

01:31:31.864 --> 01:31:36.407
- Your ticket, madam?
- I'm sorry. I'm looking for someone.

01:32:10.528 --> 01:32:16.282
Cantata
- Storm Clouds

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.277
<i># There came</i>

01:34:59.447 --> 01:35:01.689
<i># A whispered terror</i>

01:35:01.866 --> 01:35:07.287
<i># On the breeze</i>

01:35:07.455 --> 01:35:13.992
<i># And the dark forest shook</i>

01:35:15.546 --> 01:35:17.669
<i># And on the trembling trees</i>

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.419
<i># Came the nameless fear</i>

01:35:22.595 --> 01:35:25.596
<i># And panic overtook</i>

01:35:25.765 --> 01:35:27.722
<i># And panic overtook</i>

01:35:27.892 --> 01:35:30.465
<i># Each flying creature</i>

01:35:30.645 --> 01:35:35.223
<i># Of the wild</i>

01:35:47.662 --> 01:35:51.327
<i># And when they all had fled</i>

01:35:51.499 --> 01:35:53.657
<i># And when they all had fled</i>

01:35:53.834 --> 01:35:56.954
<i># And when they all had fled</i>

01:35:57.129 --> 01:35:59.917
<i># And when they all had fled</i>

01:36:00.091 --> 01:36:02.712
<i># Yet stood the trees</i>

01:36:02.885 --> 01:36:05.423
<i># Yet stood the trees</i>

01:36:05.596 --> 01:36:09.297
<i># Yet stood the trees</i>

01:36:09.475 --> 01:36:13.936
<i># Around whose heads</i>

01:36:14.105 --> 01:36:15.932
<i># Screaming</i>

01:36:16.107 --> 01:36:22.359
<i># The night birds wheeled and shot away</i>

01:36:26.993 --> 01:36:31.536
<i># Yet stood the trees</i>

01:36:31.706 --> 01:36:33.698

<i># Wheeled</i>

01:37:19.003 --> 01:37:27.011
<i># And shot</i>

01:37:28.846 --> 01:37:35.430
<i># Away</i>

01:38:10.888 --> 01:38:13.889
<i># Finding release</i>

01:38:14.058 --> 01:38:17.842

them onward like their prey</i>

01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:20.227

<i># The storm clouds broke</i>

<i># The storm clouds</i>

<i># The storm clouds broke</i>

01:39:44.815 --> 01:39:51.483
<i># The storm clouds broke</i>

01:39:51.656 --> 01:39:57.990
<i># The storm clouds broke

01:39:58.496 --> 01:40:01.912
<i># The storm clouds broke</i>

01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:05.203
<i># And drowned the dying moon</i>

01:40:05.378 --> 01:40:09.162
<i># The storm clouds broke</i>

01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:12.507
<i># The storm clouds broke</i>

01:40:12.677 --> 01:40:18.466
<i># The storm clouds broke</i>

01:40:27.817 --> 01:40:29.856
<i># Finding release</i>

01:40:30.027 --> 01:40:34.440
<i># The storm clouds broke</i>

01:40:34.615 --> 01:40:36.987
<i># Finding release</i>

01:40:37.159 --> 01:40:41.868

<i># The storm clouds broke</i>

01:40:55.636 --> 01:41:01.093
<i># Finding</i>

01:41:01.684 --> 01:41:05.516
<i># Release #</i>

01:41:22.914 --> 01:41:25.452
What happened?

01:41:28.544 --> 01:41:31.913
I saw the gun. He was pointing
it at the Prime Minister.

01:41:32.089 --> 01:41:34.877
He was going to kill him, and
I realised I had to scream.

01:41:48.606 --> 01:41:52.817
- Then he didn't kill him?
- Your wife saved him.

01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:56.397
Oh, there they are.

01:41:56.572 --> 01:41:59.775
Please come over and let
the prime minister thank you.

01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:03.450
It won't take very long.
Would you come along?

01:42:09.627 --> 01:42:11.750
Oh, yes.

01:42:11.921 --> 01:42:14.957
Yes. Prime Minister, this is the young lady.

01:42:15.132 --> 01:42:17.670
Dear lady, I'm forever in your debt.

01:42:17.843 --> 01:42:19.753
<i>This is her husband.</i>

01:42:19.929 --> 01:42:22.716
I trust you'll permit me
to wait upon you tomorrow

01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:26.805
and to express to you
the depth of my gratitude.

01:42:26.978 --> 01:42:31.805
- It wasn't - - But it
was, my dear lady. It was.

01:42:31.983 --> 01:42:35.399
Will you excuse us.

01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:37.609
Excuse me, but I have to go.

01:42:45.913 --> 01:42:48.831
I think Mr Buchanan would
like a word with you.

01:42:54.672 --> 01:42:56.665
Where's our boy? Where's Hank?

01:42:56.841 --> 01:43:00.174
We can talk if you'll come in here.

01:43:02.763 --> 01:43:04.388
So you both knew the
time and place all along.

01:43:04.557 --> 01:43:05.932
Don't be a fool.

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:08.342
An odd coincidence, both
of you turning up here.

01:43:08.519 --> 01:43:11.354
It's a pity you didn't contact your
assistant. He told us you were here.

01:43:11.522 --> 01:43:14.607
- I beg your pardon?
- We need that help you offered.

01:43:17.153 --> 01:43:19.478
Sir, we've questioned the woman.

01:43:19.655 --> 01:43:22.146
Said she bought a ticket which
happened to place her in the box

01:43:22.325 --> 01:43:24.317
with the man who did the shooting.

01:43:24.493 --> 01:43:27.067
- If she knows anything, she won't say.
- I'll see her later.

01:43:27.246 --> 01:43:30.081
- Very good, sir.
- Please tell me everything, now.

01:43:30.249 --> 01:43:34.199
Everything. There's still
plenty of room for hope.

01:43:42.845 --> 01:43:45.052
His Excellency will see you now.

01:44:08.871 --> 01:44:10.698
And that's that, I suppose.

01:44:10.873 --> 01:44:12.913
Yes. All right.

01:44:17.088 --> 01:44:21.216
Excuse me, sir. I have
a lot to explain to you.

01:44:21.384 --> 01:44:23.922
<i>Something very unusual has happened.</i>

01:44:25.596 --> 01:44:28.383
I also have to have the
money to pay the marksman.

01:44:28.558 --> 01:44:30.799
Wouldn't that be superfluous,

01:44:30.977 --> 01:44:33.550
considering... that he's dead?

01:44:40.903 --> 01:44:44.853
His aim wasn't quite as
good as you led me to expect.

01:44:45.032 --> 01:44:48.532
The target merely received a
slight flesh wound in the arm.

01:44:48.703 --> 01:44:50.909
Worse than useless.

01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:54.781
Then your French friend
panicked, made a fatal crash,

01:44:54.959 --> 01:44:57.746
landing on the floor of the Albert Hall.

01:45:01.841 --> 01:45:04.795
I don't see how you can blame me for that.

01:45:04.969 --> 01:45:07.590
He was warmly recommended
by our people in Marrakech.

01:45:07.763 --> 01:45:11.049
I'm glad that you are able to
treat the matter so lightly.

01:45:11.225 --> 01:45:13.550
I'm holding a reception here this evening.

01:45:13.728 --> 01:45:17.560
In a few moments, I have to welcome our
prime minister as my guest of honour,

01:45:17.732 --> 01:45:21.564
when I hoped and expected that he
would be totally unable to attend.

01:45:23.487 --> 01:45:27.271
- That amuses you, no doubt.
- I don't know what to say...

01:45:27.450 --> 01:45:28.730
<i>No.</i>

01:45:31.495 --> 01:45:35.327
But I do. You have muddled
everything from the start.

01:45:35.499 --> 01:45:37.991
Taking that child with you from Marrakech.

01:45:38.169 --> 01:45:41.620
Don't you realise that Americans
dislike having their children stolen?

01:45:41.797 --> 01:45:44.834
How else could I make sure
that McKenna would keep quiet?

01:45:45.009 --> 01:45:48.010
Then, to crown it all, you get cold feet

01:45:48.179 --> 01:45:52.177
and come running along here to hide,
bringing the wretched child with you.

01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:55.719
Don't you see what you've done to
the diplomatic status of this embassy?

01:45:55.895 --> 01:45:57.934
I didn't think. I only thought we could -

01:45:58.105 --> 01:46:02.851
How are you going to get the
child out of here, eh? Eh? EH?

01:46:03.027 --> 01:46:06.063
No difficulty about that, surely? The car.

01:46:06.239 --> 01:46:10.616
With plainclothes detectives
planted right 'round this building?

01:46:10.785 --> 01:46:13.536
You English intellectuals
will be the death of us all.

01:46:13.704 --> 01:46:15.662
I'll think of something. Only give me time.

01:46:15.831 --> 01:46:17.374
Time. Huh!

01:46:25.383 --> 01:46:28.633
I want the child removed from this embassy,

01:46:28.803 --> 01:46:33.631
and removed in such a way that
he won't be able to say any more

01:46:33.808 --> 01:46:35.432
where he has been tonight.

01:46:35.601 --> 01:46:37.558
Oh, no!

01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:44.143
<i>- I'll see to it.
- Drayton!</i>

01:46:44.318 --> 01:46:47.236
I trust that nothing will go wrong this time.

01:46:53.619 --> 01:46:55.826
It would be very unfortunate for you if -

01:46:58.082 --> 01:46:59.541
Yes, come in.

01:47:02.169 --> 01:47:06.119
Your Excellency, the princess
should be arriving at any moment.

01:47:18.311 --> 01:47:20.849
I recognised him. He recognised me.

01:47:21.022 --> 01:47:24.106
He tried to get away, made
a jump for it. That was all.

01:47:24.275 --> 01:47:27.062
Trying to liquidate one
of their own big shots.

01:47:27.236 --> 01:47:30.570
I wish they'd stick to their usual
custom and do it in their own country.

01:47:32.992 --> 01:47:35.068
Yes?

01:47:36.579 --> 01:47:39.152
Buchanan speaking.

01:47:41.959 --> 01:47:44.035
Right. Thank you.

01:47:44.712 --> 01:47:46.586
The Draytons are at the embassy.

01:47:46.756 --> 01:47:48.333
- The what?
- How do you know?

01:47:48.507 --> 01:47:51.793
We have ways of finding out, from the inside.

01:47:51.969 --> 01:47:55.089
If the Draytons are at the
embassy, then our boy's there too.

01:47:55.264 --> 01:47:59.511
- Probably. But we can't do anything.
- What do you mean?

01:47:59.685 --> 01:48:02.307
Every embassy in a foreign country has extra
- territorial rights.

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:05.765
- What's that?
- It's as if the embassy is on foreign soil.

01:48:05.942 --> 01:48:09.441
So they can steal kids and
get away with it? What is this!

01:48:09.612 --> 01:48:13.147
<i>We could have the Foreign Office
serve a writ on the ambassador.</i>

01:48:13.324 --> 01:48:16.823
I'm not responsible for the
complications of international law.

01:48:16.994 --> 01:48:21.989
<i>If only we had some positive proof
that your boy really is in there.</i>

01:48:28.047 --> 01:48:31.001
Say, wh-what's the phone
number of that embassy?

01:48:31.175 --> 01:48:33.666
- You got it? - What
are you thinking of -

01:48:33.844 --> 01:48:37.011
- Let me try something.
- Grosvenor 0-1-4-4.

01:48:37.181 --> 01:48:40.135
Grosvenor
0-1-4-4, please.

01:48:40.309 --> 01:48:43.476
That fellow that got shot's
a prime minister, isn't he?

01:48:45.356 --> 01:48:49.354
<i>Hello? Hello, I'd like to speak
to the prime minister, please.</i>

01:48:49.527 --> 01:48:51.401
Yeah, yeah. No, look...

01:48:51.571 --> 01:48:54.406
Just tell him the lady that saved
his life would like to speak to him.

01:48:54.574 --> 01:48:57.195
- It's very important.
- Ben, what do I say?

01:48:57.368 --> 01:49:00.037
He wanted to visit with
us so he could thank you.

01:49:00.204 --> 01:49:02.778
Tell him you want to come
over to the embassy tonight,

01:49:02.957 --> 01:49:05.246
cos we're going to leave London tomorrow.

01:49:05.418 --> 01:49:07.494
Hello? Here you are.

01:49:07.670 --> 01:49:08.749
Hello?

01:49:08.921 --> 01:49:13.417
My dear lady, this is a charming surprise.

01:49:13.593 --> 01:49:16.380
Uh-huh.

01:49:16.554 --> 01:49:19.887
Mm-hm. Delighted. Delighted, delighted.

01:49:20.057 --> 01:49:22.727
The ambassador too would be delighted.

01:49:22.894 --> 01:49:25.431
Any friends of mine are friends of his.

01:49:29.066 --> 01:49:30.691
He said all right.

01:49:32.361 --> 01:49:34.687
- If he asks you, we're all set.
- What if they don't?

01:49:34.864 --> 01:49:37.569
Have we ever been to a party
where they didn't ask you?

01:49:37.742 --> 01:49:41.692
Now, your job is to hold
their attention, right?

01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:48.122
Good evening
- Dr and Mrs McKenna.

01:49:48.294 --> 01:49:50.619
How very nice to see you.

01:49:50.796 --> 01:49:54.248
The prime minister's waiting
for you. Come this way.

01:50:02.183 --> 01:50:04.057
Ah, madame!

01:50:04.769 --> 01:50:08.352
- Good evening, good evening.
- Good evening.

01:50:08.523 --> 01:50:12.223
This is the charming lady who
saved my life at the concert.

01:50:12.401 --> 01:50:18.072
Madam, you saved the life of the one
man who's irreplaceable in our country.

01:50:19.283 --> 01:50:22.154
<i>I hear you are the famous Jo Conway, madame?</i>

01:50:22.328 --> 01:50:25.614
<i>- Yes, I'm Jo Conway.
- Perhaps we might...</i>

01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:28.541
I'm sure my wife would be
delighted to sing for you.

01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:31.829
- Wouldn't you, dear?
- Well, it's been quite some time...

01:50:32.004 --> 01:50:33.249
I beg you, madame.

01:50:33.422 --> 01:50:37.206
<i>A tranquil coda to
conclude a dramatic evening.</i>

01:50:37.385 --> 01:50:39.923
I'm very flattered.

01:50:40.096 --> 01:50:41.923
Um, Stanis?

01:50:42.098 --> 01:50:44.553
<i>Would you put up some
chairs? And hurry up, please.</i>

01:50:44.725 --> 01:50:50.479
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Jo Conway has
consented to sing a few songs for us.</i>

01:50:50.648 --> 01:50:56.437
<i>Darling, would you see that the
prime minister gets a good seat.</i>

01:50:56.612 --> 01:51:00.692
Would you like to come to the
piano? I do hope it's tuned.

01:51:00.867 --> 01:51:04.117
<i>- Would you not like to sit down, sir?
- Er...</i>

01:51:04.287 --> 01:51:07.952
No, thank you. I'll just stand over here.

01:51:23.472 --> 01:51:26.308
<i># When I was just a little girl</i>

01:51:26.475 --> 01:51:30.853
<i># I asked my mother, What will I be?</i>

01:51:31.022 --> 01:51:35.648
<i># Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?</i>

01:51:35.818 --> 01:51:40.030
<i># Here's what she said to me</i>

01:51:40.198 --> 01:51:44.610
<i># Que sera, sera</i>

01:51:44.785 --> 01:51:48.569
<i># Whatever will be, will be</i>

01:51:49.290 --> 01:51:52.741
<i># The future's not ours to see</i>

01:51:52.919 --> 01:51:56.963
<i># Que sera, sera</i>

01:51:57.381 --> 01:52:01.000
<i># What will be, will be</i>

01:52:02.511 --> 01:52:05.927
<i># When I was just a child in school</i>

01:52:06.098 --> 01:52:09.218
<i># I asked my teacher, What should I try?</i>

01:52:10.269 --> 01:52:14.397
<i># Should I paint pictures?
Should I sing songs?</i>

01:52:14.565 --> 01:52:18.017
<i># This was her wise reply</i>

01:52:18.194 --> 01:52:22.274
<i># Que sera, sera</i>

01:52:22.448 --> 01:52:26.398
<i># Whatever will be, will be</i>

01:52:26.577 --> 01:52:30.160
<i># The future's not ours to see</i>

01:52:40.341 --> 01:52:43.295
<i># When I grew up and fell in love</i>

01:52:43.469 --> 01:52:49.223
<i># I asked my sweetheart, What lies ahead?</i>

01:52:49.392 --> 01:52:54.219
<i># Will we have rainbows day after day</i>

01:52:54.397 --> 01:52:57.600
<i># Here's what my sweetheart said</i>

01:52:57.775 --> 01:53:01.725
<i># Que sera, sera</i>

01:53:01.904 --> 01:53:06.981
<i># Whatever will be, will be</i>

01:53:07.159 --> 01:53:11.406
<i># The future's not ours to see...</i>

01:53:11.581 --> 01:53:13.454
That's my mother's voice!

01:53:13.624 --> 01:53:16.958
<i>- That's my mother singing!
- What?</i>

01:53:18.963 --> 01:53:21.039
Are you sure, Hank?

01:53:21.215 --> 01:53:23.089
Are you quite sure?

01:53:23.259 --> 01:53:25.050
That's her! I know it!

01:53:27.638 --> 01:53:29.714
What's she doing here?

01:53:43.988 --> 01:53:46.859
Hank, can you whistle that song?

01:53:47.033 --> 01:53:49.025
I guess so.

01:53:51.579 --> 01:53:53.370
Then go on. Whistle it.

01:53:53.539 --> 01:53:56.991
Whistle it as loud as you can.

01:54:06.969 --> 01:54:08.761
<i># Will we have rainbows</i>

01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:12.133
<i># Day after day?</i>

01:54:12.308 --> 01:54:16.555
<i># Here's what my sweetheart said</i>

01:54:20.608 --> 01:54:24.606
<i># Ever will be, will be</i>

01:54:24.779 --> 01:54:28.278
<i># The future's not ours to see</i>

01:54:28.449 --> 01:54:30.691
<i># Que sera, sera</i>

01:54:31.869 --> 01:54:35.701
<i># What will be, will be</i>

01:54:35.873 --> 01:54:39.076
<i># Now I have children of my own</i>

01:54:39.252 --> 01:54:44.293
<i># They ask their mother, What will I be?</i>

01:54:44.465 --> 01:54:49.542
<i># Will I be handsome? Will I be rich?</i>

01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:54.928
<i># I tell them tenderly</i>

01:54:55.101 --> 01:54:59.513
<i># Que sera, sera</i>

01:54:59.689 --> 01:55:04.066
<i># Whatever will be, will be</i>

01:55:04.235 --> 01:55:07.734
<i># The future's not ours to see</i>

01:55:07.905 --> 01:55:11.820
<i># Que sera, sera</i>

01:55:11.993 --> 01:55:16.536
<i># What will be, will be... #</i>

01:55:16.706 --> 01:55:20.205
You two wait in the mail
room. I'll bring him down.

01:55:22.378 --> 01:55:24.834
Give me about five minutes.

01:56:22.605 --> 01:56:23.850
No!

01:56:26.901 --> 01:56:28.940
Oh, Daddy!

01:56:31.197 --> 01:56:33.604
Take the boy. Go! But you must be quick!

01:56:33.783 --> 01:56:35.277
Come on, son.

01:56:39.747 --> 01:56:41.158
Don't touch him.

01:56:46.379 --> 01:56:48.455
I don't think you're
going to do any shooting,

01:56:48.631 --> 01:56:51.122
<i>not with these people
downstairs and police outside.</i>

01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:54.669
You're not in a very happy
position yourself, you know.

01:56:56.264 --> 01:57:00.392
- You've got to let the boy go!
- Precisely what I'm thinking.

01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:05.138
Now I'm sure you're going to be
sensible and help me out of here.

01:57:05.314 --> 01:57:07.805
Don't ask me for help, you miserable s-

01:57:07.984 --> 01:57:13.191
You wouldn't want your father
to get hurt, would you, Hank?

01:57:13.364 --> 01:57:17.314
<i>Now we're going to walk
downstairs together, casually,</i>

01:57:17.493 --> 01:57:19.818
like three old friends.

01:57:19.996 --> 01:57:24.040
Then we're going to take a stroll
as far as the nearest taxi rank.

01:57:24.208 --> 01:57:27.577
I hope there won't be any
emotional scenes on the way down.

01:57:27.753 --> 01:57:29.829
Do as he says, Hank.

01:57:31.841 --> 01:57:34.213
No, the other way. The other way.

01:57:34.385 --> 01:57:36.461
Shall we be going?

01:57:36.637 --> 01:57:38.963
All right, start down the hall, son.

01:57:41.726 --> 01:57:44.181
Don't say anything.

01:58:18.429 --> 01:58:23.056
<i># Now it's goodbye</i>

01:58:23.226 --> 01:58:25.302
<i># And we're facing</i>

01:58:25.478 --> 01:58:32.608
<i># Such lonely tomorrows</i>

01:58:32.777 --> 01:58:36.988
<i># So many sunsets</i>

01:58:37.156 --> 01:58:40.905
<i># Till there's a sunset</i>

01:58:41.077 --> 01:58:44.280
<i># When all at once</i>

01:58:44.455 --> 01:58:47.990
<i># You'll be there</i>

01:58:49.377 --> 01:58:52.331
<i># Then we'll</i>

01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:56.875
<i># Kiss again</i>

01:58:57.051 --> 01:59:00.135
<i># And again</i>

01:59:00.304 --> 01:59:02.630
<i># And again #</i>

01:59:12.191 --> 01:59:14.267
Hank!

01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:19.856
Come on, Hank.

01:59:26.038 --> 01:59:28.114
Oh, Mother!

01:59:35.089 --> 01:59:38.754
I'm sorry we were gone so long,
but we go and pick up Hank.

01:59:38.926 --> 01:59:41.002
Ohh!
