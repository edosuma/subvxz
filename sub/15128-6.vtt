00:27.766 --> 00:30.600
Artherton. What is this?

00:30.602 --> 00:32.914
The gout, Captain Jackson.

00:32.987 --> 00:35.168
I'm sent for to attend a case of gout?

00:35.169 --> 00:37.306
Well, that would be...

00:37.410 --> 00:40.371
considerate, Captain Jackson,
but it was not myself who...

00:40.372 --> 00:41.338
Then who?

00:42.396 --> 00:44.470
Come on. I'm due. I have...

00:44.599 --> 00:46.127
I have important matters to attend!

00:46.128 --> 00:47.668
Who the hell sent for me, God damn it?

00:47.677 --> 00:49.251
I sent for you, Captain.

00:51.866 --> 00:54.190
You're not supposed to
start until tomorrow.

00:57.495 --> 00:59.726
Now, Reid, no.

00:59.761 --> 01:01.416
I have obligations.

01:01.451 --> 01:04.501
I am... I am formally
requested elsewhere.

02:15.534 --> 02:20.534
<b>PetaG
addic7ed</b>

02:24.400 --> 02:26.036
Jee-sus.

02:26.094 --> 02:27.400
What did she do?

02:27.450 --> 02:28.908
She come quietly, Mr. Drake?

02:29.732 --> 02:31.076
She did, sir.

02:31.111 --> 02:32.589
Have her booked, Sergeant.

02:32.624 --> 02:34.232
What charge, Inspector?

02:34.267 --> 02:35.841
Suspicion of murder.

02:38.173 --> 02:39.907
As you wish, Mr. Reid.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.175
Your name, ma'am?

02:42.177 --> 02:43.343
Vera Carswell.

02:43.345 --> 02:45.153
Full name, please.

02:48.278 --> 02:50.988
Vera Carswell, Lady Montacute.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.086
Now, if you'd go with
Mr. Drake, Lady Vera.

02:55.969 --> 02:57.373
Ma'am.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.368
That tailcoat is loaned.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.448
Your dead room, Captain.

03:07.483 --> 03:09.388
The full why awaits you there.

03:12.037 --> 03:15.060
Her name was Ida Watts.

03:15.710 --> 03:19.189
She sold blooms from the steps
of Christ Church, Spitalfields.

03:20.107 --> 03:23.437
Might once have found you a
white rose, for your buttonhole.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.425
That woman, she upstairs,

03:27.563 --> 03:30.015
of noble title, found lying naked

03:30.016 --> 03:33.863
in a Whitechapel boarding house
with this murdered flower girl.

03:33.919 --> 03:37.897
She is, you've heard, of
some standing in this country.

03:38.416 --> 03:39.615
And this lady,

03:40.154 --> 03:43.187
we have now only till
daybreak before her people

03:43.222 --> 03:45.292
and the lawyers arrive to set her free.

03:47.134 --> 03:48.976
Do you understand, Captain?

04:04.359 --> 04:06.015
Shut it, the lot of ya!

04:19.736 --> 04:20.981
Sit down, ma'am.

04:23.216 --> 04:25.034
Come on, boys. Get 'em up.

04:27.241 --> 04:29.078
Have a care my darlin'

04:37.600 --> 04:39.467
Quiet!

04:39.469 --> 04:40.681
Quiet!

04:41.214 --> 04:42.444
Silence, you runts!

04:42.445 --> 04:44.542
We're gonna need this
dress when you're through.

04:44.577 --> 04:45.804
Through with what?

04:45.805 --> 04:48.885
Gathering of truth from
your person, my lady.

04:49.301 --> 04:51.614
Does he always speak in that tone?

04:51.732 --> 04:52.932
Hands, Duchess.

04:53.319 --> 04:54.543
I'm not a Duchess.

04:59.412 --> 05:00.851
Which tone is that?

05:00.886 --> 05:03.282
Abraham, reborn as a file clerk.

05:11.722 --> 05:13.839
My, you are thorough.

05:14.659 --> 05:17.307
Well, I enjoy my work, Baroness.

05:24.951 --> 05:26.444
Just a little keepsake.

05:27.282 --> 05:29.518
-Do you have all you need?
-Yeah, for now.

05:34.321 --> 05:36.321
Go easy on him, will you?

05:40.393 --> 05:41.493
Now,

05:42.061 --> 05:44.219
What am I to do with you, Lady Vera?

05:44.254 --> 05:47.065
Ask me questions, I'd imagine.

05:50.604 --> 05:52.401
Did you kill Ida Watts?

05:52.481 --> 05:54.238
Is that her name?

05:55.372 --> 05:56.610
No.

05:56.810 --> 05:57.875
I did not.

05:57.877 --> 05:59.742
You were found laying
in the same bed as

05:59.743 --> 06:02.972
her murdered body,
her blood all about you.

06:03.416 --> 06:04.556
How is that?

06:05.539 --> 06:07.468
I do not know.

06:08.457 --> 06:11.089
I travelled to Whitechapel with friends

06:11.435 --> 06:13.036
and we took in a show.

06:13.037 --> 06:14.005
Which hall?

06:14.006 --> 06:16.493
The Cambridge, on Commercial Street.

06:16.629 --> 06:18.483
We brought champagne.

06:18.698 --> 06:21.600
The party broke up and I remained.

06:21.635 --> 06:24.502
You enjoy the music hall theatre here?

06:24.504 --> 06:25.587
Yes.

06:26.373 --> 06:29.269
Lacks pretence, and that pleases me.

06:29.270 --> 06:31.301
The acts you saw?

06:31.444 --> 06:32.810
There was a man

06:32.987 --> 06:33.912
in a hat.

06:33.947 --> 06:35.313
Sawed a woman in two.

06:35.828 --> 06:38.255
And two fat ladies sang on the subject

06:38.290 --> 06:40.985
of being two fat ladies
on... on how they wanted

06:41.020 --> 06:44.603
to put Mr. Gladstone in a
pie and eat him for supper.

06:44.858 --> 06:46.453
It was all very amusing.

06:47.014 --> 06:48.034
And thereafter?

06:48.881 --> 06:50.456
More champagne, and...

06:51.287 --> 06:52.442
nothing.

06:53.338 --> 06:57.673
Until that shrill squawk
of the landlady woke me up.

06:58.058 --> 06:59.895
You say you were drugged...

06:59.971 --> 07:00.719
No.

07:01.135 --> 07:02.508
You said that.

07:03.885 --> 07:06.042
Although I imagine it so, yes.

07:06.142 --> 07:08.749
Forgive me, Lady Vera,
but given the fact of where

07:08.751 --> 07:12.080
we have just now brought you
from and where you were found,

07:12.388 --> 07:15.942
this face you offer to the world...

07:16.358 --> 07:18.495
some could call it heartless.

07:19.014 --> 07:20.474
I am calm.

07:21.247 --> 07:23.313
-It is how I was raised.
-You are calm,

07:23.314 --> 07:24.646
and then some more.

07:24.647 --> 07:26.814
I do not believe it a pretence, but...

07:28.843 --> 07:30.499
I believe you unafraid.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.360
Perhaps I have nothing
to be frightened of.

07:32.395 --> 07:33.869
Murderesses hang just as surely

07:33.904 --> 07:35.344
as murderers do, Lady Vera.

07:35.345 --> 07:38.579
Yes, but that is a title
that I am suspected of,

07:38.581 --> 07:39.851
and you, Inspector,

07:39.852 --> 07:42.299
make great play of my actual one.

07:43.236 --> 07:44.768
And you know, therefore,

07:44.803 --> 07:47.732
the forces that now rally to my side.

07:48.221 --> 07:51.107
And I make no boast of
it, I promise you that.

07:51.365 --> 07:52.963
In many respects,

07:53.728 --> 07:56.876
it is my great sadness, my family.

07:58.661 --> 07:59.791
But...

08:00.368 --> 08:01.501
they will not allow me

08:01.503 --> 08:04.965
to linger here for long,
whatever the charge.

08:10.825 --> 08:12.236
Send her in.

08:17.819 --> 08:20.753
I look forward to resuming
our acquaintance in due course.

08:28.537 --> 08:30.105
Good evening.

08:30.728 --> 08:32.001
I am Vera.

08:32.674 --> 08:33.767
Strip,

08:33.863 --> 08:34.892
now.

08:38.207 --> 08:42.076
I think we must have her moved.
Let's see her secured in my office.

08:42.077 --> 08:43.126
Yes, Mr Reid.

08:43.152 --> 08:45.873
Strip, strip, strip, strip...

08:45.983 --> 08:46.935
Quiet!

08:46.964 --> 08:48.129
Strip, strip...

08:48.130 --> 08:49.218
Shut it!

08:49.483 --> 08:50.231
Mr. Reid...

08:51.237 --> 08:52.461
Forgive me, sir... I...

08:52.462 --> 08:53.908
Why should I ever need to do that?

08:55.132 --> 08:56.955
Your Mathilda...

08:58.830 --> 08:59.748
Should you not...?

08:59.749 --> 09:03.642
Governess... Miss Forbes...
first night.

09:08.848 --> 09:09.736
Denton.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.705
3... F!

09:45.191 --> 09:47.085
Lady Montacute's dress.

09:47.644 --> 09:49.402
Just put it over there.

09:57.301 --> 09:58.571
These are examined?

09:58.664 --> 09:59.820
She comes first.

10:02.570 --> 10:04.490
The bedding in which they were found...

10:04.905 --> 10:06.176
Velvet quilts...

10:07.417 --> 10:08.430
silk sheeting...

10:09.204 --> 10:11.903
You'll have a future as a draper
should this life let you down.

10:14.970 --> 10:18.328
It is good fabric, quality...

10:19.617 --> 10:25.755
The premises in which she and the
lady were found, were not quality.

10:26.213 --> 10:30.254
So what, you think her highness down
there is made to feel comfortable?

10:31.792 --> 10:36.071
She visits often enough.
She is made to feel at home.

10:37.723 --> 10:39.223
In Whitechapel.

10:40.980 --> 10:43.060
Such length gone to...

10:43.886 --> 10:45.234
just for a murdering.

10:47.652 --> 10:49.965
I would not have given it credit.

10:50.418 --> 10:51.757
Himself, I mean.

10:53.182 --> 10:55.640
Strolling back into the office,
as though all he suffered

10:55.641 --> 10:57.742
was a weekend's course
of fishing on the Wandle.

10:57.947 --> 11:00.056
What would you prefer, Jackson,

11:00.135 --> 11:01.500
that he not come back at all?

11:01.535 --> 11:03.358
It's not a question
of what I prefer.

11:03.359 --> 11:06.093
I'm just merely confused
as to what he chooses.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.876
Last time I see him, him
and his girl they're leaving.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.277
The only thing to stop 'em...

11:11.502 --> 11:13.549
him taking two bullets.

11:15.512 --> 11:17.793
Are you going to stand there
and tell me you don't see it?

11:18.162 --> 11:19.863
-See what?
-Come on...

11:20.693 --> 11:25.064
He thought to conceal it, but that man
wore his torment like a carnival mask.

11:25.065 --> 11:27.486
-And now...
-Now... what?

11:27.978 --> 11:29.823
You could not call him happy.

11:29.858 --> 11:30.786
Happy?

11:32.011 --> 11:34.512
I did not say happy, I say...

11:35.550 --> 11:36.412
Tranquil?

11:36.480 --> 11:39.012
Yeah... that.

11:56.364 --> 11:58.390
The strength required.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.250
Is a woman...

12:01.320 --> 12:03.726
that woman in our
cells... is she capable?

12:04.174 --> 12:07.168
Women are capable of
most anything, Drake.

12:07.889 --> 12:08.948
By way of example,

12:08.983 --> 12:11.667
if I'm not at the Cafe
Monaco to toast the birthday

12:11.668 --> 12:14.672
of Miss Hermione Morton
by 10:00, she's gonna use

12:14.673 --> 12:17.337
a butter knife to scalp
me and not think twice.

12:34.447 --> 12:36.263
Good evening, Sergeant.

12:36.764 --> 12:37.671
Sir.

12:37.672 --> 12:39.472
I'm searching for my wife.

12:39.473 --> 12:40.890
The lady's name?

12:40.925 --> 12:42.858
Her name is my name, Montacute.

12:47.791 --> 12:50.376
There is a parlour beyond, sir.

12:51.663 --> 12:53.011
If you will wait awhile,

12:53.046 --> 12:55.738
I shall see if someone
shall come and speak to ya.

12:55.773 --> 12:56.686
Then she's here?

12:56.687 --> 12:58.574
As I said, sir, have yourself a seat.

12:58.576 --> 13:00.859
Let me go, copper! I swear it!

13:00.860 --> 13:02.311
You have it wrong!

13:04.674 --> 13:05.573
Thomas Denton,

13:05.574 --> 13:07.784
picked up by request of Mr. Reid, sir.

13:07.785 --> 13:09.451
It's the cousin, is it, Constable?

13:09.452 --> 13:11.104
Miss Watts' cousin, Mr. Drake.

13:11.613 --> 13:12.927
Good work, Grace.

13:12.928 --> 13:16.416
Book him in, would ya? You
boys, take him down to lock-up.

13:17.453 --> 13:18.181
Argh!

13:19.025 --> 13:20.921
There is a lady down
there already, however.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.221
She you will move to
Mr. Reid's office, got it?

13:23.223 --> 13:24.222
Yes, Inspector.

13:28.539 --> 13:29.287
Any better?

13:29.327 --> 13:31.504
It is a curse Bennet. I tell ya.

13:35.155 --> 13:36.932
Black rum, Don?

13:36.967 --> 13:39.423
W... there is relief with it.

13:39.508 --> 13:42.844
No, no, it is water you need.
And plenty of it. This is mine now.

13:42.845 --> 13:45.688
-No, Bennet. Please!
-Orders, Sergeant,

13:45.708 --> 13:47.137
are for your benefit.

13:47.587 --> 13:48.948
Take heed, Constable.

13:49.038 --> 13:49.783
That,

13:50.387 --> 13:51.931
that is bad living.

13:52.369 --> 13:54.381
Water, Don.
Water.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.089
Excuse me, ma'am.

14:06.990 --> 14:08.723
You are excused.

14:21.585 --> 14:23.385
Move a step, would you?

14:27.073 --> 14:28.262
There.

14:28.758 --> 14:29.604
Good.

14:29.605 --> 14:31.271
Now I can see you.

14:38.869 --> 14:40.013
Sergeant.

14:40.731 --> 14:43.238
-Inspector Reid.
-He's in the parlour?

14:43.531 --> 14:44.617
Indeed, sir.

14:45.776 --> 14:47.853
Word of advice.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.628
Never ice for the gout.

14:50.781 --> 14:52.714
Then what, sir?

14:53.677 --> 14:54.676
What!?

14:55.539 --> 14:57.852
Prayer, Mr. Artherton.

15:05.162 --> 15:06.494
Lord Montacute.

15:13.894 --> 15:15.522
My apologies for keeping
you waiting.

15:15.523 --> 15:16.743
Yes. You are?

15:16.824 --> 15:17.823
Reid.

15:17.824 --> 15:19.159
I'm in command here.

15:21.213 --> 15:22.935
Is she here?

15:26.337 --> 15:28.003
When last were you with her?

15:28.205 --> 15:29.204
Last night,

15:29.519 --> 15:31.178
the night before this.

15:31.179 --> 15:32.136
Where that, sir?

15:32.137 --> 15:35.190
Here, near here. Music hall.

15:35.191 --> 15:36.839
-Which?
-I don't know which.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.736
Um... Vera brought me to it.

15:40.095 --> 15:42.864
Which entertainment did you enjoy?

15:44.665 --> 15:46.988
Well, a fellow performing
magic tricks...

15:47.023 --> 15:51.539
um... two women singing about
Gladstone, in poor taste.

15:51.558 --> 15:52.851
I left, and she remained...

15:52.912 --> 15:54.798
God damn it, man, is she here?

15:56.465 --> 15:57.804
She is.

15:59.652 --> 16:03.688
And she's well and unharmed?

16:03.890 --> 16:06.190
She is unharmed.

16:07.860 --> 16:10.594
Then... why do you keep her?

16:11.276 --> 16:12.396
Forgive me, sir,

16:12.398 --> 16:15.761
but you are both a good ways
off your natural territory.

16:15.762 --> 16:17.998
Well, I assure you, Inspector,
it's not by my choosing.

16:19.205 --> 16:20.755
She brought me to the music hall.

16:20.790 --> 16:22.273
I left and she remained.

16:22.274 --> 16:26.376
And you leave her to travel about
this borough alone, and as she pleases?

16:26.399 --> 16:27.723
Well, I do not lock her up!

16:27.758 --> 16:29.864
Nor worry about
her overly, it seems.

16:31.901 --> 16:36.195
What I mean to say, is that so much
of her seems a mystery to you, sir.

16:36.230 --> 16:39.495
Well we're all mysteries
to one another, Inspector.

16:41.098 --> 16:43.823
Wives, are nothing if not
the exemplar of that fact.

16:43.824 --> 16:46.004
Now, you heard this from me.

16:46.039 --> 16:49.013
Yes, Lady Vera is
detained at your pleasure,

16:49.015 --> 16:51.216
but habeas corpus
is a powerful tool

16:51.251 --> 16:53.418
in the hands of an
expensive attorney.

16:54.257 --> 16:57.366
You may rest assured that
I retain the most ruinous.

16:57.958 --> 16:59.931
Now, you know who I am,

17:00.165 --> 17:01.959
Who my family is.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.743
Come morning, Inspector Reid,

17:05.023 --> 17:08.864
the weight of the world will
break over your station house,

17:10.598 --> 17:12.537
and my wife will come home.

17:19.917 --> 17:23.006
Dear, it is only
a name, Constable.

17:23.143 --> 17:27.776
I shall give you mine. It is
Vera. Vera Violet Elizabeth.

17:28.267 --> 17:32.306
That was three names, and
you haven't even given me one.

17:35.773 --> 17:36.911
It's Robert.

17:37.718 --> 17:39.412
Well Bobby,

17:39.994 --> 17:42.864
you are a far sight too
handsome for this work.

17:45.118 --> 17:46.244
And yet...

17:47.871 --> 17:49.902
you wear a uniform.

17:50.962 --> 17:53.135
My goodness, take it from me...

17:53.863 --> 17:56.555
uniforms have an
affect on a girl.

17:58.019 --> 18:01.522
There is a girl,
isn't there Bobby?

18:03.750 --> 18:04.788
Is she pretty?

18:07.227 --> 18:08.615
Good...

18:09.595 --> 18:12.976
I hate to imagine
you with a plain girl.

18:13.509 --> 18:19.161
And imagine you I shall,
Bobby, you and your girl.

18:19.803 --> 18:22.430
Do you dream of marrying her, Bobby?

18:24.360 --> 18:25.960
Let me tell you...

18:26.216 --> 18:27.743
do not.

18:28.460 --> 18:31.185
There is a prevailing
morality to our world...

18:31.220 --> 18:33.149
and it instructs us thus...

18:33.184 --> 18:36.216
find another, build a
home, raise a family...

18:36.235 --> 18:38.056
the avoidance of
these instructions

18:38.057 --> 18:40.181
will result in all
manner of perdition.

18:40.447 --> 18:41.489
But...

18:41.951 --> 18:45.208
it is a righteousness,
only recently conceived,

18:45.243 --> 18:47.531
and it ignores many truths.

18:47.566 --> 18:49.820
The cumulative wisdom
of which is this...

18:49.957 --> 18:57.277
you, we, people, our
instincts, our desires,

18:57.422 --> 19:00.477
we are entirely at odds,
without moral decree.

19:00.478 --> 19:02.124
So I tell you this Bobby...

19:02.125 --> 19:06.936
be sure to enjoy those others who
toss their hair, and avert their eyes

19:06.971 --> 19:08.506
when you sweep in before them.

19:08.507 --> 19:13.508
You may have Mary, Martha,
Josephine, three times over...

19:16.037 --> 19:17.870
should you so wish it.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.580
Reid... good.

19:40.888 --> 19:44.456
See here this knifed
cavity in the chest?

19:44.458 --> 19:46.359
That's not one wound, but many.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.375
From the lesions and damage
to the heart and lungs,

19:48.376 --> 19:51.627
I count nine strikes with
a blade... chop, chop, chop.

19:52.764 --> 19:54.366
You wished my reading of it.

19:54.368 --> 19:55.799
It is fury.

19:56.913 --> 19:59.255
Many repeated blows
at the same location.

19:59.256 --> 20:00.255
It is rage.

20:01.084 --> 20:02.683
Hatred, too, perhaps.

20:03.167 --> 20:04.931
You found him? Denton?

20:05.388 --> 20:07.894
He has known the inside
of a station house before.

20:09.183 --> 20:10.274
Mr. And Mrs.

20:10.309 --> 20:13.046
Daniel Fairfax of Blandford
Street, Marylebond.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.920
Drugged and thieved two years past.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.485
They named Thomas Denton.

20:17.758 --> 20:18.909
Drugging?

20:19.059 --> 20:21.632
That is the woman Montacute's
defence, is it not?

20:21.633 --> 20:24.039
The claim is then withdrawn, however,

20:24.040 --> 20:26.904
once Mr. Denton is allowed
response to the allegation

20:26.905 --> 20:29.692
and points out, amongst other vices,

20:29.737 --> 20:32.815
the drugging was at Mr.
and Mrs. Daniel Fairfax's

20:32.816 --> 20:34.974
invitation and billing.

20:34.975 --> 20:36.123
He, Denton,

20:36.124 --> 20:39.252
is their waged pilot
into a world of vice.

20:39.446 --> 20:42.835
He procured for them
seats at the music hall,

20:42.870 --> 20:45.073
pipes of opium at a Limehouse den.

20:45.505 --> 20:46.903
He brought guards with him

20:46.938 --> 20:49.276
for their wanderings
through the rookeries.

20:49.277 --> 20:52.545
No wonder, then, the
allegation is forgot.

20:53.475 --> 20:55.164
Here, this was found.

20:55.165 --> 20:57.376
It's been emptied, but there are dregs.

20:57.411 --> 20:58.466
It's a...

20:59.230 --> 21:01.187
a powdery composite.

21:02.536 --> 21:03.669
Narcotic?

21:04.851 --> 21:07.153
Now, that's an assumption, Inspector.

21:07.188 --> 21:08.375
Then let us make another.

21:08.550 --> 21:11.086
Let us think on the for
why that those such

21:11.087 --> 21:13.334
as the Fairfaxes,
Lady Vera Montacute,

21:13.555 --> 21:15.961
might feel a yen to come visit us here.

21:16.504 --> 21:17.985
Slum tourists.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.829
You wish to feel what
the extremes of life

21:19.830 --> 21:21.832
might sound, look, taste like.

21:21.867 --> 21:23.835
This is the place to find out.

21:23.837 --> 21:26.299
Velvet and silk, home from home.

21:26.771 --> 21:28.366
The wealthy and the privileged

21:28.661 --> 21:30.308
come for the thrill
of their corruption,

21:30.310 --> 21:32.594
and this... this girl here,

21:32.629 --> 21:34.879
She, I come to believe,

21:34.881 --> 21:36.881
the collateral for those desires.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.697
She will have justice.

21:41.512 --> 21:44.347
Vera, Lady Montacute, her husband,

21:44.382 --> 21:47.657
and his title are sat in
our booking hall, waiting.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.073
Alone for now,

21:49.256 --> 21:52.858
but his minions now gather, so we must

21:52.893 --> 21:55.768
forge a proof so sound
that it may stand strong

21:55.803 --> 21:59.101
against the combined weight of this
island's ruling class altogether,

21:59.321 --> 22:01.538
and we must do this by dawn.

22:03.349 --> 22:05.824
Captain, you said you
are expected elsewhere.

22:05.874 --> 22:07.949
I... I am.

22:11.546 --> 22:14.015
she will cut out my
heart with a teaspoon,

22:14.016 --> 22:16.865
she will remove my
brains with a tin opener.

22:19.297 --> 22:20.289
This.

22:20.844 --> 22:23.578
There is sufficient
remaining for an examination?

22:23.579 --> 22:24.901
Perhaps.

22:25.020 --> 22:26.694
Then you do it.

22:29.748 --> 22:31.003
Mr. Drake,

22:31.436 --> 22:33.871
you are to make yourself
known to Thomas Denton...

22:34.096 --> 22:36.111
myself, I shall, um...

22:36.307 --> 22:39.736
I shall go gaze upon the
beautiful Lady Vera once more.

22:48.466 --> 22:51.181
That limp, that cane...

22:51.681 --> 22:55.622
that's camouflage Drake, I tell
you. It's a God damned deception.

22:58.804 --> 23:00.884
Constable Grace, if you please.

23:00.885 --> 23:04.044
Fetch your great brain to
Captain Jackson's assistance.

23:05.790 --> 23:07.185
Clever too!

23:08.401 --> 23:09.830
Goodbye Robert.

23:14.545 --> 23:16.505
Remember what I tell you.

23:38.597 --> 23:41.675
I imagine that a gift of yours...

23:42.563 --> 23:45.279
the making of friends
in strange pastures.

23:45.314 --> 23:46.828
I am sociable, Inspector.

23:46.863 --> 23:47.857
Indeed.

23:48.298 --> 23:51.391
Your way made from your
Oxfordshire estates, via your

23:51.392 --> 23:55.512
home in Regent's Park, to
rented rooms in Whitechapel.

23:55.879 --> 23:57.706
Excuse me, I forget...

23:58.112 --> 24:01.268
you have no memory of the
journey made to those rooms.

24:01.830 --> 24:05.026
Only your drugged champagne
at The Cambridge, and then...

24:05.407 --> 24:06.624
oblivion.

24:07.528 --> 24:08.578
Correct?

24:08.718 --> 24:09.919
Correct.

24:11.080 --> 24:14.202
Then let us perhaps
therefore, talk a little more

24:14.237 --> 24:17.324
broadly, of what it is
brings you to Whitechapel.

24:17.325 --> 24:19.860
For this is surely not
your first excursion

24:20.246 --> 24:21.863
to this corner of London here.

24:21.898 --> 24:24.553
How quaint you make
it sound, Inspector.

24:25.045 --> 24:26.278
Whitechapel,

24:27.209 --> 24:30.071
the place that so very nearly
took your life from you.

24:33.643 --> 24:37.311
But it's not simply the
music halls of this borough

24:37.312 --> 24:38.813
on which you fix your attention.

24:38.815 --> 24:40.014
It is not.

24:40.421 --> 24:44.236
They are diverting, but
I read your newspapers.

24:44.962 --> 24:47.688
The real entertainments
are found in your streets.

24:47.878 --> 24:50.024
That is not music hall, Countess.

24:50.026 --> 24:50.879
That is life.

24:50.880 --> 24:51.839
Indeed.

24:52.228 --> 24:55.234
Believe me, Inspector, it
is in the life of this city

24:55.235 --> 24:59.505
that my fascination
is rooted... your life,

24:59.506 --> 25:01.737
for most pertinent example.

25:02.442 --> 25:03.458
A man

25:03.803 --> 25:05.907
who climbed out of death's grip

25:06.202 --> 25:09.143
and has now returned
to his life's duty.

25:11.458 --> 25:12.476
I cannot tell you

25:12.477 --> 25:15.246
how pleased I am to
have met you, Inspector.

25:18.252 --> 25:20.147
Such fascination,

25:20.795 --> 25:24.137
such an eye for event,

25:24.836 --> 25:29.548
and yet that eager
witnessing of yours so dulled

25:29.549 --> 25:33.050
that around you, beside you,
even perhaps by your hand,

25:33.167 --> 25:36.577
a woman is stabbed
ten times over and you

25:36.818 --> 25:40.093
unable to bring to mind a moment of it.

25:42.677 --> 25:45.737
Perhaps it is because you are callous.

25:47.375 --> 25:48.914
But though you watch

25:49.320 --> 25:51.429
and that you titillate
yourself in that watching,

25:51.464 --> 25:52.767
you do not care.

25:53.132 --> 25:54.220
Goodness.

25:55.195 --> 25:57.621
Such insight, Inspector.

25:58.885 --> 26:01.438
Perhaps that is why
fate has brought me here?

26:02.116 --> 26:05.911
For the great Edmund
Reid to show me to myself?

26:05.912 --> 26:08.542
And how you are jaded, my lady.

26:08.577 --> 26:11.969
Are you really so without
hope for your life?

26:12.004 --> 26:13.480
Perhaps I am.

26:14.970 --> 26:16.771
I should say,

26:16.773 --> 26:18.139
Lady Vera,

26:18.575 --> 26:22.629
that the life that I
imagine you wish to escape,

26:22.939 --> 26:26.296
that which brings you far
from its genteel restrictions,

26:26.331 --> 26:29.866
perhaps at least the few
hours you pass with us,

26:29.901 --> 26:31.185
that life is here.

26:32.265 --> 26:35.222
Now it's come for you.

26:35.725 --> 26:38.194
Your husband waits beneath.

26:43.517 --> 26:45.745
He is a soldier, you know?

26:45.746 --> 26:47.491
So I understand.

26:48.231 --> 26:50.017
My knight-errant.

27:07.583 --> 27:09.462
That your manor for all time, is it?

27:10.101 --> 27:11.577
Where we found you?

27:11.914 --> 27:13.131
Born there, weren't I.

27:15.186 --> 27:16.354
You never left?

27:16.424 --> 27:18.329
I've been to Covent Garden,

27:18.818 --> 27:20.247
I've been to Marylebone.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.949
And though the paving
stones may be cleaned

27:24.950 --> 27:26.867
of all shit, and the
shops sell perfume...

27:26.911 --> 27:30.742
there's not a song to be heard in
the air, nor a friend to be seen.

27:30.865 --> 27:31.788
And you,

27:33.117 --> 27:34.612
from the voice on you, you are what,

27:35.829 --> 27:37.305
five streets from your raising?

27:37.560 --> 27:39.726
Rookery off back of Little Paternoster.

27:41.609 --> 27:44.176
Ida. She's your cousin.

27:45.106 --> 27:46.423
Of a kind.

27:46.851 --> 27:48.870
My aunt is our brother's girl.

27:53.370 --> 27:55.032
So, her old man.

27:55.526 --> 27:57.950
That would be Frank
Watts, would it not?

27:59.215 --> 28:00.753
Known to you?

28:01.046 --> 28:02.755
Her mother was an Ivory, therefore.

28:05.234 --> 28:07.635
I knew her brother Samuel.

28:08.183 --> 28:09.713
We ran together awhiles.

28:09.898 --> 28:13.933
And how is it that you're
stood there and myself...

28:13.935 --> 28:15.942
in these here?

28:19.664 --> 28:20.845
Army.

28:26.732 --> 28:28.676
Now, here's what I'm thinking, Tom.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.328
I have no fight with you

28:31.329 --> 28:33.798
taking an opportunity when it comes.

28:34.167 --> 28:38.203
These gents and ladies, they
come a-wandering down here

28:38.493 --> 28:41.877
as if our lives were naught
but a fairground sideshow.

28:42.523 --> 28:45.413
To my mind, they are
ripe for a fleecing.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.833
And you, son,

28:46.835 --> 28:48.301
would not be sat there

28:48.303 --> 28:50.770
were that all we
thought you tangled in.

28:55.485 --> 28:57.176
Your Ida's lies dead,

28:57.178 --> 28:59.593
naked as the day she were born,

28:59.913 --> 29:03.730
her skinny ribs plundered
with the sharpest of knives,

29:05.086 --> 29:06.917
and you the cause of it.

29:07.518 --> 29:09.130
Not me.

29:09.703 --> 29:12.116
No. I done nothing.

29:13.194 --> 29:15.728
You find me someone to say otherwise.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.932
But they do say otherwise, Tom.

29:21.417 --> 29:23.247
They do now, leastwise.

29:24.126 --> 29:26.852
Now you are fetched here
under suspicion of it.

29:28.353 --> 29:29.967
I told ya.

29:31.133 --> 29:32.701
I've done nothing.

29:33.133 --> 29:34.818
I know nothing.

29:35.758 --> 29:38.854
And you, copper.

29:39.149 --> 29:42.083
You may scrap your
attempt to make kin of me.

29:42.985 --> 29:46.370
Could be that you once walked
on my side of the street,

29:46.694 --> 29:49.145
but you walk there no longer.

29:51.107 --> 29:52.334
Grace,

29:53.065 --> 29:56.076
the lady upstairs,
what do you make of her?

29:58.303 --> 30:04.265
I think she understands how to
set about holding power over a man.

30:06.838 --> 30:08.723
Microscope, bring it over here.

30:11.178 --> 30:12.820
She's of the moment,

30:14.541 --> 30:18.356
haircut and unforgiving symmetry?

30:21.293 --> 30:22.994
It is elegant, certainly.

30:23.830 --> 30:26.959
But Ida, is, she not elegant also?

30:31.245 --> 30:32.601
Not so much.

30:33.489 --> 30:36.328
But she aspires to such
elegance, she affects it.

30:37.559 --> 30:38.920
Here, take a look...

30:42.823 --> 30:46.043
The hair, at least what's
hair, it's been dyed.

30:46.050 --> 30:50.765
Dyed recently, and cut recently.
Cut in an approximation, do you see?

30:51.978 --> 30:54.217
To her highness upstairs.

30:59.798 --> 31:02.955
Grace, you go fetch the
inspectors to me now, okay?

31:25.628 --> 31:27.997
First a theory, second a fact.

31:28.130 --> 31:30.124
In both cases, the
motives and for whys leave

31:30.159 --> 31:32.118
me stumped, but you're
gonna want to hear them.

31:32.153 --> 31:34.246
Here, Grace. You... you tell them.

31:36.092 --> 31:38.138
"It is indeed narcotic,

31:38.139 --> 31:40.617
but it is not pure
and it's not orthodox.

31:40.686 --> 31:42.010
It is a blend...

31:42.045 --> 31:43.907
cocaine, hydrochloride,

31:43.942 --> 31:46.937
and morphine sulphate combined in...

31:47.107 --> 31:49.683
i... insufflation."

31:49.901 --> 31:53.614
Ida. The same residue was
caught in her nasal cavity.

31:53.649 --> 31:56.268
It's a powder, it's
combined, and it's snorted.

31:56.269 --> 31:57.100
And the effects?

31:57.135 --> 31:58.605
I haven't sampled it myself.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.075
Give the man time, however.

32:00.076 --> 32:01.519
But in principle, the two would

32:01.520 --> 32:03.200
balance one another.

32:03.235 --> 32:04.645
The jitters of the cocaine,

32:04.647 --> 32:06.870
suppress the languor of the morphine,

32:06.905 --> 32:11.670
elevated euphoria, less
the attendant despair.

32:11.705 --> 32:13.700
An amalgam a woman such as Lady Vera

32:13.735 --> 32:15.020
might have made on demand.

32:15.021 --> 32:17.539
Although not in such a ratio as this.

32:17.540 --> 32:19.921
Three parts morphine
to one part cocaine.

32:19.956 --> 32:21.982
Good night, sweetheart.

32:22.102 --> 32:24.405
It is overbalanced with intention.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.708
Mr. Denton. This is his chosen system.

32:26.709 --> 32:28.308
He drugs, then he robs.

32:28.817 --> 32:30.891
Then, why use the cocaine at all?

32:31.055 --> 32:33.060
So that the effects
appear initially consistent

32:33.062 --> 32:34.883
with that which the lady desires.

32:34.918 --> 32:35.963
But once achieved,

32:35.965 --> 32:37.670
one person may react to the effects

32:37.705 --> 32:40.174
in a fashion entirely
the reverse of another.

32:40.209 --> 32:42.643
Where senselessness might
be brought out in one,

32:42.678 --> 32:45.675
and rage instead might
be borne in another.

32:46.108 --> 32:47.441
The rage to murder?

32:49.102 --> 32:51.758
So this... these powders, this drug...

32:51.793 --> 32:54.414
that is fact, Captain. Your theory?

32:55.400 --> 32:56.984
Imagine her, Reid,

32:57.328 --> 32:58.950
alive once more.

32:59.117 --> 33:00.082
She's a pretty girl,

33:00.117 --> 33:01.013
she's got some spirit,

33:01.048 --> 33:03.842
but she's a girl of these streets.

33:04.707 --> 33:06.538
These streets, how many flower girls

33:06.573 --> 33:08.491
do you know that have
the time and inclination

33:08.492 --> 33:10.202
to see their hair so structured?

33:10.483 --> 33:12.566
I... it is dyed, also.

33:12.568 --> 33:15.243
Cut and dyed to make
her the lowly pauper

33:15.244 --> 33:17.062
to our princess above.

33:17.306 --> 33:19.640
She is made Lady Vera's twin.

33:19.642 --> 33:20.774
And there you have it.

33:21.448 --> 33:22.973
Our theory.

33:24.017 --> 33:25.593
You wish to leave us?

33:26.149 --> 33:27.948
I am expected, Reid.

33:28.799 --> 33:31.353
Captain, if you feel that you have done

33:31.822 --> 33:35.660
all you might to see her story told

33:36.078 --> 33:39.247
for those who brought
her to this exposed,

33:39.282 --> 33:43.746
then by all means, you go, please.

33:43.827 --> 33:45.902
Enjoy your evening.

33:48.183 --> 33:50.121
You know that man Capshaw?

33:50.176 --> 33:52.732
He should have asked me,
because I would have shot you

33:52.733 --> 33:55.241
clear through that
bleeding heart of yours.

33:57.980 --> 34:00.131
Inspector Drake, my sense of it is that

34:00.132 --> 34:03.984
your attempt to find
comradeship with the man Denton

34:03.986 --> 34:05.986
was not an unqualified success.

34:06.288 --> 34:07.421
He hates me.

34:07.423 --> 34:11.058
But he has knowledge of her,

34:11.060 --> 34:13.143
knowledge that I want.

34:15.364 --> 34:17.797
Mr. Reid, you may not ask that of me.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.400
I do not ask that of you, Bennet,

34:19.435 --> 34:23.704
but I would ask that you might
remember a face you once made.

34:40.864 --> 34:41.953
Them curtains...

34:42.538 --> 34:43.456
Why?

34:44.266 --> 34:45.830
Dull child that you are...

34:46.733 --> 34:48.313
witnesses they are.

34:48.329 --> 34:49.978
They still might hear, however.

34:51.641 --> 34:53.801
Hear you confess to murder, old son?

34:57.945 --> 34:59.025
You know...

34:59.568 --> 35:02.166
when I used to run with Samuel Ivory,

35:03.383 --> 35:07.116
before Major General Gordon and
his scarlet tunic came for me...

35:08.239 --> 35:11.527
I did not give one tinker's
toss for the fridge on my back.

35:13.624 --> 35:16.920
People would take one look at
me, think me naught but an animal.

35:18.937 --> 35:20.298
These days however,

35:21.562 --> 35:22.817
I'd take care

35:22.818 --> 35:24.694
for that not to be
the first thought that

35:24.695 --> 35:26.346
a man might have
at the sight of me.

35:28.786 --> 35:30.419
And you know why Thomas?

35:31.569 --> 35:35.106
Because they would think
it and they would be right.

35:42.339 --> 35:43.505
Now...

35:50.900 --> 35:52.081
What is that?

35:52.900 --> 35:54.233
What is in there?

35:55.004 --> 35:56.403
Believe me, son,

35:56.405 --> 35:59.242
when I say you do not want to know.

36:00.643 --> 36:03.948
You have cause to find out
means you have displeased me.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.947
Now, here's how we travel.

36:07.285 --> 36:10.396
I tell you what I think,
you tell me what you know.

36:11.064 --> 36:12.386
For some whiles now,

36:12.388 --> 36:14.688
you have rented the rooms on Puma Court

36:14.690 --> 36:17.522
for the pleasure of a
Miss Lady Vera Carswell.

36:17.933 --> 36:21.194
Amongst the entertainments
you fixed for her,

36:21.501 --> 36:25.353
you mixed pharmaceutical
cocaine with powdered morphine.

36:26.205 --> 36:27.631
That's right, boy.

36:27.803 --> 36:30.303
We here educate ourselves on you.

36:31.622 --> 36:34.263
That is some intoxication, I am sure.

36:38.773 --> 36:41.973
Were you there when
Ida had a snort of it?

36:43.578 --> 36:44.427
No?

36:47.691 --> 36:50.226
But you do know for why
you fetched her there,

36:50.752 --> 36:53.863
for why you had your cousin
made up to be the very mirror

36:53.864 --> 36:55.342
of that good lady above.

36:55.364 --> 36:56.316
No, you...

36:56.845 --> 37:02.465
this is a story, your mad mind, copper.

37:02.875 --> 37:05.521
I've done nothing.

37:05.856 --> 37:08.969
I know nothing.

37:12.513 --> 37:14.479
See, now you have displeased me.

37:29.221 --> 37:33.344
When I was soldiering in Egypt,
I saw a man's toe shot off.

37:33.345 --> 37:34.329
Yeah.

37:34.713 --> 37:37.322
I could not move for
enemy fire, however,

37:37.368 --> 37:39.161
not for an hour or two.

37:41.583 --> 37:43.558
Could not find the
dressin's to bind him,

37:43.983 --> 37:46.114
safety to stretcher him away...

37:46.261 --> 37:49.113
nor a single drop of
grog to dull the pain.

37:50.670 --> 37:52.800
He bled right out, he did.

37:52.802 --> 37:54.035
Fast, too.

37:54.684 --> 37:55.861
That bugger,

37:55.867 --> 37:59.674
that great toe, it is a bleeder.

38:13.458 --> 38:17.158
Now, I am told

38:18.247 --> 38:21.629
that eventually this one

38:22.515 --> 38:23.658
will get through bone.

38:23.693 --> 38:25.569
No! Please don't, I beg you!

38:25.604 --> 38:28.792
You can not! No! Please! No, no!

38:28.793 --> 38:31.805
Just a toe. You be still.

38:32.141 --> 38:34.828
You tug around like that,
there will be a fearful mess

38:34.863 --> 38:36.958
and the pain surely greater and all.

38:37.662 --> 38:42.129
You tell me you had the
narcotic mixed up different,

38:42.164 --> 38:44.665
more morphine, less cocaine,

38:44.771 --> 38:47.912
to drug and then to
rob, as is your way!

38:48.157 --> 38:50.336
No! No, stop!

38:50.371 --> 38:53.289
What mishap befell your Ida, Thomas?

38:53.324 --> 38:54.706
No! Please, I beg you!

38:54.707 --> 38:57.065
What put the powder inside her?

38:57.100 --> 38:57.676
No!

38:57.677 --> 39:02.884
For why did you have her rigged up,
like one them propers you despise so?

39:02.919 --> 39:03.768
Please, stop!

39:03.769 --> 39:05.903
Inspector Drake! No, sir!

39:07.265 --> 39:11.938
Enough! You do not hide
your barbarism from me!

39:12.585 --> 39:16.087
This is an outrage!
Get out of my sight!

39:16.219 --> 39:17.415
Please...

39:22.996 --> 39:25.477
Mr. Denton.

39:25.496 --> 39:27.308
Mr. Denton, I can only help you,

39:27.309 --> 39:32.770
I can only protect you from
him if you will speak to me.

39:33.945 --> 39:34.972
Come, come.

39:54.012 --> 39:56.780
Jesus. What is that, Don?

40:00.457 --> 40:02.189
Tincture of wolfsbane.

40:03.405 --> 40:04.036
No.

40:05.809 --> 40:08.146
I've just come from
the threat of severing

40:08.147 --> 40:10.498
that exact same digit
from the lad Denton.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.192
Do no threaten here, Bennet.

40:12.656 --> 40:14.826
You may cut the bastard thing clean off

40:14.861 --> 40:16.997
and hear nothing but
my cheering you on.

40:18.343 --> 40:20.310
We all have our crosses.

40:26.797 --> 40:28.515
Good evening, Mr. Drake.

40:28.578 --> 40:30.828
Miss Morton. Sir.

40:31.079 --> 40:32.184
Mr. Drake.

40:34.168 --> 40:37.125
My brother will not say for
why I am accompanied by him,

40:37.131 --> 40:38.998
but here, here.

40:39.591 --> 40:41.597
For my part, I have come
to string that American up

40:41.598 --> 40:42.769
by his most prized appendage.

40:42.804 --> 40:43.919
Do you mind terribly?

40:44.342 --> 40:46.653
You... you go right to it, miss.

40:47.763 --> 40:50.018
I do hope you can look after
yourself from here on in.

40:50.053 --> 40:52.109
Mimi, go away.

40:52.438 --> 40:53.474
Charming.

40:53.476 --> 40:55.241
You follow me, Miss Morton.

40:55.276 --> 40:57.007
I'll take you to the captain.

40:57.709 --> 41:00.466
Dear Sergeant, what
have you done to yourself?

41:00.467 --> 41:01.278
Nothing, miss.

41:01.279 --> 41:02.578
It looks worse than it is.

41:02.579 --> 41:03.768
Poor you.

41:03.803 --> 41:06.103
I much prefer things to
be worse than they look.

41:07.667 --> 41:08.784
Mr. Morton...

41:20.628 --> 41:21.681
You...

41:22.725 --> 41:24.396
you wear a ring, sir.

41:25.193 --> 41:26.126
I do.

41:36.189 --> 41:37.957
I've not seen her, sir.

41:38.780 --> 41:40.648
Not since the night at Blewett's.

41:40.921 --> 41:42.357
I know it.

41:49.703 --> 41:51.278
What will you do, sir?

41:52.810 --> 41:55.109
My wishes for the
future remain constant.

41:57.183 --> 41:58.804
I love her.

41:59.388 --> 42:01.069
I wish to make her happy.

42:02.407 --> 42:04.176
I've told her this, that...

42:04.740 --> 42:05.751
you...

42:06.981 --> 42:08.779
all else may be forgotten.

42:13.231 --> 42:15.285
She has been happy with me.

42:18.389 --> 42:21.136
Mr. Drake, I know you
are not a cynical man,

42:21.201 --> 42:25.137
that you act with your heart.

42:26.574 --> 42:29.001
It is to that heart that I speak now.

42:35.288 --> 42:38.165
I ask you to think on
the life Rose will have,

42:38.488 --> 42:40.525
of the life her children will have.

42:40.955 --> 42:43.361
They will run free, know
what it is to climb on oak,

42:43.362 --> 42:46.040
to... swim in a stream.

42:46.605 --> 42:48.192
And she, she will be...

42:49.140 --> 42:54.316
cared for and honoured and loved,
sir, every day that she lives.

42:58.281 --> 43:00.458
Can you say the same, Mr. Drake?

43:00.686 --> 43:02.319
Can you offer her these things?

43:03.409 --> 43:05.099
And, most importantly,

43:05.410 --> 43:07.341
would you deny her them?

43:25.987 --> 43:27.962
Captain Jackson, sir.
I bring you a visitor.

43:27.963 --> 43:30.369
Now, you listen to me, knife man.

43:30.404 --> 43:31.823
I made changes for you.

43:31.824 --> 43:33.392
I behave in ways that are surprising

43:33.393 --> 43:35.209
to all who know me, myself included.

43:35.244 --> 43:36.997
You were to meet my
father tonight, and...

43:38.466 --> 43:40.033
Aaaaah!

43:44.148 --> 43:46.435
Why, Thomas?

43:47.101 --> 43:50.067
Why was your Ida
fetched from her blooms?

43:50.075 --> 43:51.419
What use was she?

43:52.747 --> 43:54.703
The lady made a request

43:55.954 --> 43:57.562
for the man she was to bring with her.

43:57.597 --> 44:00.044
A man? A man you knew?

44:00.455 --> 44:02.177
No, sir.

44:02.724 --> 44:04.624
It was special, weren't it?

44:05.165 --> 44:07.330
She wished for you to find a woman

44:07.365 --> 44:09.495
for this male companion of hers,

44:10.066 --> 44:13.029
so you whored your cousin to this man?

44:15.003 --> 44:19.871
It was what the lady asked
for, but not what I intended.

44:20.158 --> 44:23.129
I was to be done with before
that arrangement needed meeting.

44:23.133 --> 44:25.893
And that was where the
heavy morphine blend.

44:25.928 --> 44:28.653
Lady Vera and her companion
were to be sedated.

44:29.430 --> 44:33.608
Ida was the... dispenser.

44:35.715 --> 44:38.000
And then she was to
rob them both blind.

44:39.246 --> 44:40.965
Only your drug failed you,

44:41.589 --> 44:43.131
and Ida was killed.

44:44.229 --> 44:48.253
Who by? Lady Vera or
this man you speak of?

44:48.288 --> 44:49.674
I do not know, sir.

44:51.135 --> 44:53.365
I beg you to believe
me. I was not there.

44:54.405 --> 44:56.088
And this man, Lady Vera's companion.

44:56.123 --> 44:58.518
Can you describe him?

45:00.324 --> 45:01.849
There is no need, sir.

45:02.306 --> 45:03.694
You have him here already.

45:04.781 --> 45:05.788
He is...

45:06.561 --> 45:08.069
Above.

45:21.985 --> 45:23.659
What happened to her?

45:24.716 --> 45:25.951
A knife.

45:26.331 --> 45:27.728
Killed by whom?

45:27.915 --> 45:30.080
That we do not know

45:31.866 --> 45:34.898
But she was found to bed
with a comatose noble woman...

45:36.048 --> 45:39.426
No joke, real, blue blood.

45:40.873 --> 45:41.776
Who?

45:42.863 --> 45:44.474
Montacute.

45:45.674 --> 45:47.065
Vera Carswell.

45:47.333 --> 45:49.865
My, my, Miss Morton.
How you do get around.

45:49.971 --> 45:52.966
I don't... know her... but I...

45:53.001 --> 45:56.267
My goodness, the... the stories,
the exploits have been recounted...

45:57.091 --> 45:59.132
Her husband, Lord Christopher,

45:59.496 --> 46:03.263
the full title, the Earldom, land
will all become his in due course.

46:03.288 --> 46:04.205
But she,

46:04.382 --> 46:05.385
well,

46:06.113 --> 46:08.915
all that's ever been
required of her is that she...

46:09.036 --> 46:10.707
marry well, which she has done...

46:10.742 --> 46:11.787
and then...

46:12.133 --> 46:13.698
smile and be beautiful.

46:13.946 --> 46:14.717
Although,

46:14.833 --> 46:18.882
those kinds of expectations
have been known to kill a person.

46:22.601 --> 46:24.306
But it's chilly here, Captain,

46:25.034 --> 46:26.508
and I need tea...

46:27.285 --> 46:31.635
tea that is in fact
more whiskey, than tea.

46:50.476 --> 46:52.756
She has a lovely face.

46:54.844 --> 46:57.672
God in his mercy grant her grace.

46:58.627 --> 47:00.504
"The Lady of Shalott".

47:06.359 --> 47:08.421
Take me somewhere else.

47:11.523 --> 47:13.341
This is Reid's place...

47:14.022 --> 47:16.738
he made it so he
might know anything

47:16.739 --> 47:19.747
there ever was to
know about everything.

47:22.296 --> 47:24.895
You make him sound
like a man from a fable.

47:26.780 --> 47:29.382
In many ways, that
is exactly what he is.

47:39.874 --> 47:44.138
If there was a file on
you, what would it say?

47:44.930 --> 47:46.448
Um...

47:47.266 --> 47:51.598
He had a talent for runnin', until...

47:53.278 --> 47:54.213
Until?

47:55.255 --> 47:57.441
until he decided to stop.

48:02.681 --> 48:04.246
And yours, Miss Morton?

48:08.868 --> 48:10.433
mine's not written yet.

48:16.757 --> 48:18.578
Listen to me, darlin'.

48:19.797 --> 48:22.545
Now, these people, your people,
they come to these streets

48:22.580 --> 48:25.114
and they find whatever kick they
can before they go home again.

48:26.704 --> 48:28.604
Is that all I am to you?

48:30.700 --> 48:32.083
No.

48:32.800 --> 48:35.038
Not all, just most.

49:00.467 --> 49:02.684
Word has it this civilian

49:02.967 --> 49:06.040
has been wandering freely
about my station house.

49:06.041 --> 49:07.827
Well, what can I say, Inspector?

49:07.828 --> 49:10.240
The mountain came to to Mohammed.

49:20.655 --> 49:25.623
That man, Lord Montacute,
Major Christopher Carswell,

49:25.658 --> 49:29.297
come here so brazen, entitled as he is,

49:29.332 --> 49:32.347
thinking to hide in plain view.

49:33.233 --> 49:34.860
Tut, tut, tut.

49:34.861 --> 49:36.818
Ida. She was not interfered with?

49:36.820 --> 49:37.667
She was not.

49:37.702 --> 49:39.057
And yet we know from Thomas Denton

49:39.092 --> 49:42.481
that his cousin was ordered up
and made the twin of his wife

49:42.482 --> 49:44.094
for his, Lord Montacute's, pleasure.

49:44.129 --> 49:45.529
For his imagined pleasure.

49:45.564 --> 49:47.468
Quite so, and all at
the whim of Lady Vera.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.746
We do not know whether
he greeted her whim

49:49.747 --> 49:52.153
with distaste or delight.

49:52.188 --> 49:54.525
So, Lady Vera, unconscious.

49:54.560 --> 49:56.865
Denton's narcotics taken
their desired effect.

49:56.900 --> 49:58.877
But not upon Lord Christopher, however.

49:58.965 --> 50:00.253
He was nowhere to be seen.

50:00.288 --> 50:00.923
The drug,

50:00.958 --> 50:03.192
different powers over different bodies.

50:03.227 --> 50:05.426
Then let us imagine
Lady Vera unconscious,

50:05.442 --> 50:08.110
Ida perhaps sufficiently euphoric

50:08.111 --> 50:10.248
to partake in whatever
debauchery had been intended.

50:10.249 --> 50:11.257
But the gentleman,

50:11.258 --> 50:14.956
the narcotic running through him, has
now become homicidal. He kills her.

50:14.991 --> 50:17.226
And in his shame and
mania, he runs for home.

50:17.261 --> 50:19.020
Imagine him, return to Regent's Park,

50:19.055 --> 50:20.780
the fog of the narcotic gone from him.

50:20.781 --> 50:22.176
He cannot recall with any clarity

50:22.211 --> 50:24.264
what has passed, but he does know that

50:24.299 --> 50:26.318
his lady wife was left behind here,

50:26.353 --> 50:27.415
in Whitechapel.

50:27.417 --> 50:30.768
And somehow presents himself
to the police of that borough.

50:30.803 --> 50:31.836
And the lady,

50:33.023 --> 50:36.159
the beautiful lady, just sleeps
an innocent sleep throughout.

50:36.160 --> 50:37.724
Meanwhile, just hours since,

50:37.759 --> 50:40.399
you have the knife in her
hand and evil in her heart.

50:43.309 --> 50:44.542
One or other of them,

50:44.543 --> 50:46.534
however. One or other.

50:46.536 --> 50:48.069
Captain, I think

50:48.071 --> 50:50.271
we may consider your work done,

50:51.277 --> 50:53.289
If Miss Morton still
has need of you, that is.

50:53.290 --> 50:54.650
She'll keep.

50:55.611 --> 50:58.446
I need you to lend me Grace
a while longer, though.

51:05.846 --> 51:08.881
"Fingerprints" by Francis Galton.

51:09.936 --> 51:13.858
What say you and me make the
inspector a little homecomin' present.

51:22.396 --> 51:25.592
You see what it says
there, in the margins?

51:25.866 --> 51:27.419
You see what he wrote?

51:30.004 --> 51:34.773
"Incontrovertible truth,"
with a question mark.

51:34.964 --> 51:36.551
With a question mark.

51:36.897 --> 51:38.708
Now grab the lantern.

51:44.400 --> 51:45.951
Okay, turn up the flame.

51:47.679 --> 51:49.737
You hold it steady over that knife.

52:13.485 --> 52:14.751
Major Carswell.

52:16.567 --> 52:17.821
Your rank?

52:17.823 --> 52:19.022
Sergeant, sir.

52:19.631 --> 52:22.602
Although in this force,
I am Inspector Drake.

52:26.897 --> 52:29.171
Your service seen where, however?

52:29.566 --> 52:31.651
Egypt in the main, sir.

52:31.686 --> 52:33.737
Under whose command?

52:34.262 --> 52:36.315
Colonel Madoc Faulkner.

52:37.846 --> 52:38.909
At El Teb.

52:40.603 --> 52:42.399
You saw the worst of it, then.

52:43.630 --> 52:47.710
I was glad to get home,
sir, as you must be

52:47.810 --> 52:49.223
each time you return.

52:54.735 --> 52:56.612
I've ever been a bachelor, sir,

52:57.169 --> 52:59.820
and so can only imagine
how it is to ever be

52:59.855 --> 53:02.471
leaving and returning,
leaving and returning,

53:02.590 --> 53:05.691
an endless reacquaintance
with those we love.

53:06.015 --> 53:07.171
Well,

53:07.738 --> 53:10.497
'tis duty, Inspector Drake.

53:11.599 --> 53:14.399
What of our duty to our families,

53:14.842 --> 53:16.909
to our wives, sir?

53:18.042 --> 53:21.421
But you've only just now told
me that you lack for a wife.

53:22.285 --> 53:24.928
I must conclude, therefore, that you...

53:25.950 --> 53:27.900
you talk about me,
and I wonder what right

53:27.901 --> 53:29.350
you believe you have to do so.

53:29.351 --> 53:30.712
A policeman's right.

53:31.868 --> 53:34.343
One who investigates murder.

53:37.893 --> 53:40.244
Best you now see me
as a man to be obeyed,

53:40.376 --> 53:44.909
Major Carswell, as a man
who owns your secrets.

53:46.123 --> 53:48.528
Your wife's secrets, also.

53:55.360 --> 54:00.255
One of you has killed a
young lady this night last.

54:00.863 --> 54:04.135
A girl made to resemble your wife, sir.

54:04.938 --> 54:06.173
The three of you...

54:06.536 --> 54:08.318
enjoying a little party,

54:08.353 --> 54:10.528
in our corner of London, here.

54:11.180 --> 54:12.108
Yes.

54:13.142 --> 54:14.676
We know it all, sir.

54:15.075 --> 54:16.713
All save one fact,

54:17.488 --> 54:20.742
which of you it was,
drove the knife into her.

54:23.001 --> 54:26.062
The girl, made up to
resemble your wife.

54:26.248 --> 54:27.776
Her name was Ida.

54:29.621 --> 54:32.033
What pleasure did your wife believe

54:32.068 --> 54:34.445
you might find in that act, sir?

54:36.395 --> 54:38.059
Pleasure indeed.

54:41.273 --> 54:44.746
She wished me to...

54:47.665 --> 54:49.841
Make love to both of them,

54:51.888 --> 54:53.240
Two Veras.

54:55.330 --> 54:56.377
It's a mountain to try and

54:56.378 --> 54:58.244
to find love for just the one of her.

54:59.939 --> 55:02.132
That... that boy... that earnest,

55:02.133 --> 55:04.171
Toynbee-type, fool
enough to strike you,

55:05.762 --> 55:09.421
he can harp on his trees, and
his streams... for swimming!

55:09.579 --> 55:10.727
It's...

55:11.937 --> 55:13.824
He thinks it an arcadia in waiting.

55:13.859 --> 55:18.274
But if there's doubt in him now, it
will be a... a hell. A hell, Mr. Drake.

55:18.276 --> 55:20.591
Your wife, Major.

55:22.853 --> 55:25.298
Let us stay on the
subject of your wife.

55:26.251 --> 55:29.583
Such a... an arrangement.

55:30.222 --> 55:32.555
What does she stand to gain from that?

55:32.642 --> 55:35.322
Your affections rekindled?

55:35.323 --> 55:38.176
Perhaps. That woman's mind is her own.

55:39.741 --> 55:41.254
And so...

55:41.666 --> 55:42.665
You did not.

55:45.103 --> 55:46.610
I tried.

55:48.974 --> 55:53.768
She asked me to try, so I did.

55:55.556 --> 55:57.614
And then, sir?

55:57.616 --> 55:59.015
She laughed at me.

55:59.017 --> 56:00.049
Who did?

56:02.628 --> 56:05.173
Both of them...

56:06.515 --> 56:09.040
No, Vera...

56:10.161 --> 56:11.924
The other. I d...

56:12.030 --> 56:13.346
The...

56:14.499 --> 56:16.128
A powder.

56:17.936 --> 56:20.344
Whatever she had given me, I...

56:22.591 --> 56:24.207
couldn't tell them apart.

56:24.209 --> 56:27.606
And so you picked up the knife,

56:28.372 --> 56:30.065
You struck out.

56:31.270 --> 56:32.159
No.

56:32.605 --> 56:34.050
No. I do not...

56:34.052 --> 56:35.411
She laughed at you.

56:35.891 --> 56:37.347
You thought it your wife

56:37.348 --> 56:40.490
humiliating you, and you struck out.

56:43.987 --> 56:45.184
Sir,

56:45.397 --> 56:49.955
why did you come here
tonight if not in truth,

56:49.991 --> 56:52.995
because you hoped to unburden yourself?

56:57.473 --> 57:02.351
Now, she laughed, you struck out.

57:03.410 --> 57:06.523
No, Sergeant.

57:09.190 --> 57:11.349
I do not remember.

57:25.249 --> 57:28.150
If you would stand for me now, Major.

57:33.529 --> 57:35.635
Many a marriage has
failed, as we all know,

57:35.636 --> 57:39.474
but such a striving to see one
revived, Lady Vera. It suggests...

57:40.222 --> 57:42.853
A... what should we
call it... a... a commitment

57:42.854 --> 57:44.501
to the life which wearies you so.

57:44.536 --> 57:47.404
I confess myself glad that
your celebrated faculties

57:47.405 --> 57:50.156
are unharmed by your
recent ordeal, Inspector.

57:50.224 --> 57:52.224
You make no denials, therefore?

57:52.368 --> 57:54.927
Denial would be
predictable, would it not?

57:54.929 --> 57:56.500
It would be customary.

57:56.664 --> 57:58.134
Well, then, there you have it.

57:58.614 --> 58:00.820
I do try not to be boring.

58:02.367 --> 58:05.304
You consider that the
worst of sins, I imagine.

58:06.629 --> 58:08.745
What is it you want to know?

58:08.842 --> 58:12.453
Which of you and your
husband performed the act?

58:14.488 --> 58:16.276
I am inclined to tell you.

58:16.277 --> 58:17.583
You will have my gratitude.

58:17.883 --> 58:19.607
As inducement, however,

58:19.608 --> 58:21.653
I would hear something
from you, Inspector.

58:24.870 --> 58:26.765
What do you remember?

58:27.428 --> 58:29.797
Five days in death's maw.

58:29.997 --> 58:31.667
What did you see there

58:32.156 --> 58:35.651
as you stood at the border
between life and death?

58:38.257 --> 58:42.481
I give you my word,
you tell me something,

58:43.187 --> 58:45.798
and I will give you all that I know.

58:59.789 --> 59:01.889
You ask me what I saw.

59:01.891 --> 59:02.879
Yes.

59:03.386 --> 59:04.378
Nothing.

59:07.129 --> 59:10.064
But I might tell you what I... felt.

59:10.241 --> 59:11.641
All the better.

59:13.884 --> 59:18.501
I was not afraid, not for a moment.

59:19.975 --> 59:23.777
I sensed that I was held.

59:23.812 --> 59:25.379
By what? By God?

59:26.396 --> 59:28.240
I put no name on it.

59:29.284 --> 59:30.917
I feel no need to do so.

59:37.975 --> 59:39.443
Are you aware, my lady,

59:39.444 --> 59:42.210
of a medical procedure
known as trepanning?

59:42.728 --> 59:46.951
Yes. The boring of a
hole through the skull.

59:46.986 --> 59:47.767
Quite so.

59:48.092 --> 59:51.081
It's been practised
since prehistoric times,

59:51.116 --> 59:54.277
but there is evidence to suggest that,

59:54.312 --> 59:56.827
a small section of bone that is removed

59:56.862 --> 59:59.342
to expose the dura mater of the brain

59:59.343 --> 01:00:02.915
was then worn as an
amulet around the neck.

01:00:02.917 --> 01:00:04.614
A charm? Against what?

01:00:04.649 --> 01:00:05.818
Who can say?

01:00:06.431 --> 01:00:12.027
But I know what malignancy
I now wear mine against

01:00:14.604 --> 01:00:16.711
and what I imagine the prehistorics

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.523
felt guarded against.

01:00:22.854 --> 01:00:24.774
Self-regard.

01:00:27.113 --> 01:00:31.323
They looked out from their
caves across unsheltered plains

01:00:31.617 --> 01:00:35.048
and knew that all that lay out
there was savage and hostile

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:37.561
to their existence on that earth,

01:00:37.892 --> 01:00:42.221
and they saw the threat and
felt only the urge to stride out,

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:45.677
to find food, bring it home,

01:00:46.394 --> 01:00:50.154
to survive, continue.

01:00:52.293 --> 01:00:53.933
The necessity of struggle,

01:00:54.516 --> 01:00:57.169
the collective, placed above the self.

01:00:57.578 --> 01:01:00.056
In death, the affirmation of life.

01:01:02.804 --> 01:01:04.371
You think me clichéd.

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:07.395
No. On the contrary.

01:01:13.856 --> 01:01:16.389
Where is that constable of yours?

01:01:17.225 --> 01:01:18.391
The pretty one.

01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:21.452
Have him come here

01:01:21.487 --> 01:01:27.032
with copy paper and
a pen to write with.

01:01:27.799 --> 01:01:29.535
Grace!

01:01:30.169 --> 01:01:32.859
"I, Vera Carswell, Lady Montacute,

01:01:32.894 --> 01:01:36.692
wish to confess to the murder
by stabbing of Ida Watts

01:01:37.076 --> 01:01:40.154
in the attic rooms rented by myself

01:01:40.189 --> 01:01:42.594
of Alderman's lodging
house on Puma Court."

01:01:42.595 --> 01:01:43.984
You keep writing, Constable.

01:01:44.019 --> 01:01:46.262
What, er, time did
this event take place?

01:01:46.387 --> 01:01:47.486
I cannot say.

01:01:47.848 --> 01:01:50.739
I was incapacitated
due to the effects of

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.248
a cocaine and sulphurous
morphine amalgam

01:01:53.249 --> 01:01:55.843
that I had a Mr. Thomas
Denton make for me.

01:01:55.844 --> 01:01:57.643
Explain the presence of Miss Watts.

01:01:59.113 --> 01:02:03.057
I asked Mr. Denton if
he would find a girl

01:02:03.092 --> 01:02:05.026
who could be made to look like me.

01:02:05.182 --> 01:02:08.497
He found her, and I
saw her hair dressed

01:02:08.532 --> 01:02:10.804
and coloured and her face made up.

01:02:10.805 --> 01:02:11.871
Why do this?

01:02:14.425 --> 01:02:15.990
You asked me

01:02:16.509 --> 01:02:20.571
why it is I come here to these streets,

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:22.852
where you find your daily struggles

01:02:22.853 --> 01:02:27.953
with its dirt and its
deaths and its chaos.

01:02:29.215 --> 01:02:33.553
Everything that you would see
rid from this world, Mr. Reid,

01:02:35.332 --> 01:02:37.316
I glorify.

01:02:38.768 --> 01:02:40.390
And so, yes.

01:02:40.605 --> 01:02:43.602
I brought my husband to those rooms

01:02:43.603 --> 01:02:46.699
and that girl because I thought that...

01:02:49.969 --> 01:02:52.444
well, I thought that
he might want to join me

01:02:52.479 --> 01:02:56.116
in that glorifying and that I might

01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:58.892
perhaps not be so alone

01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:01.693
in all that I did

01:03:02.324 --> 01:03:06.430
and thought and felt.

01:03:06.864 --> 01:03:08.907
But he did not join you.

01:03:08.908 --> 01:03:09.707
No.

01:03:10.991 --> 01:03:13.416
He looked at me with
the same incomprehension

01:03:13.417 --> 01:03:15.227
with which you look at me now.

01:03:15.687 --> 01:03:18.813
How many times did you put
the knife into Ida Watts?

01:03:19.215 --> 01:03:21.068
For reasons I have already stated,

01:03:21.069 --> 01:03:23.118
I... I cannot be sure, but...

01:03:24.338 --> 01:03:28.488
It was more than thrice,
but less than ten times.

01:03:35.686 --> 01:03:41.412
The power of sharpened steel
to cut through flesh, you...

01:03:42.095 --> 01:03:45.154
you might expect it to need strength,

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.968
but she gave way with ease.

01:03:48.062 --> 01:03:49.488
And why?

01:03:50.202 --> 01:03:52.154
Why did you kill Miss Watts?

01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:55.324
Because she did not prove amusing

01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.229
and because I wanted to know
how it would feel to do so.

01:04:04.822 --> 01:04:09.011
Now, I imagine you
want me to sign beneath.

01:04:36.877 --> 01:04:39.746
Do not worry, Robert.

01:04:40.749 --> 01:04:43.209
They're not all like me.

01:04:44.675 --> 01:04:47.828
I'm not like a single woman alive.

01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:58.229
He claims not to recall.

01:04:58.562 --> 01:04:59.944
And she has confessed.

01:04:59.945 --> 01:05:03.368
And yet I do not feel the
truth shine upon us, Bennet.

01:05:04.118 --> 01:05:05.404
You two.

01:05:05.852 --> 01:05:07.592
Come see what I made.

01:05:13.821 --> 01:05:19.038
It is the smear of blood on the knife.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.670
It is the magnified bloody imprint

01:05:21.705 --> 01:05:24.301
on the thumb rise of the handle.

01:05:24.355 --> 01:05:26.045
What is it you've made, Jackson?

01:05:27.805 --> 01:05:29.993
It is the incontrovertible truth.

01:05:29.994 --> 01:05:31.258
Well...

01:05:31.882 --> 01:05:34.611
It's an attempt. Look here.

01:05:35.852 --> 01:05:37.864
Now, after the third or fourth thrust,

01:05:37.899 --> 01:05:41.348
Ida's blood got gluey,
so that there is the mark

01:05:41.383 --> 01:05:43.596
of the thumb of the
hand that killed her.

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:47.923
Mr. Galton's theory runs thus, that
the tip of each and every finger

01:05:47.924 --> 01:05:50.591
contains parallel ridges. See,
Bennet? See your own there?

01:05:50.648 --> 01:05:53.373
These ridges form walls or patterns,

01:05:53.374 --> 01:05:55.975
each one entirely
distinct from its neighbour

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:58.749
and each one entirely
distinct from human to human.

01:05:58.807 --> 01:06:01.138
The print of such is
therefore entirely unique.

01:06:01.139 --> 01:06:02.794
The chances of any two
prints being alike are,

01:06:02.795 --> 01:06:05.092
so Mr. Galton has
it, one in 64 billion.

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:07.389
And we wouldn't be the first, either.

01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:10.556
There's a detective in Argentina
that used this very same method

01:06:10.558 --> 01:06:13.222
to bring a woman to trial for
the murder of her children.

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:16.261
Mr. Galton recommends a
printer's ink for the best sample.

01:06:16.263 --> 01:06:18.163
Which we are unlikely
to find at this hour.

01:06:18.165 --> 01:06:19.980
And there is little
time remaining to us.

01:06:20.338 --> 01:06:22.034
I've got another idea, however.

01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:39.656
Morning, your highness.

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.080
Now place each thumb in the soot.

01:07:03.822 --> 01:07:05.373
Make your mark.

01:07:41.711 --> 01:07:43.295
Sergeant Artherton!

01:07:45.814 --> 01:07:47.113
Gentlemen,

01:07:47.194 --> 01:07:49.035
if you would care to
wait for a few moments.

01:07:59.282 --> 01:08:03.432
Do you know what it is brings
the gout out for me, Sergeant?

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.347
No, Chief Inspector.

01:08:05.616 --> 01:08:08.317
The full weight of
the British aristocracy

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:10.829
waking me before
I have had my kippers.

01:08:11.736 --> 01:08:15.718
Where is the miraculously
returned, Reid?

01:08:17.287 --> 01:08:19.009
Where is he?

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:22.876
They are the same?

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:26.179
The two forkings at the
end of the two ridges

01:08:26.214 --> 01:08:28.966
that make the island there...
they are identical, yes.

01:08:29.002 --> 01:08:31.618
And these? These prints are whose?

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:36.410
Lord Montacute.

01:08:38.768 --> 01:08:40.721
Inspector Reid, Inspector Drake.

01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:42.621
Morning, Chief.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:46.787
Edmund, a word.

01:08:47.386 --> 01:08:49.852
So that I understand,

01:08:50.381 --> 01:08:54.203
you have a signed confession
on the part of the lady.

01:08:54.707 --> 01:08:55.912
I do.

01:08:56.374 --> 01:08:59.953
And somehow it does not suffice.

01:08:59.953 --> 01:09:01.002
I believe that she,

01:09:01.037 --> 01:09:03.054
for reasons too perverse to imagine,

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:05.487
but I believe that she
wishes herself guilty.

01:09:05.999 --> 01:09:07.755
She wishes herself hanged.

01:09:08.099 --> 01:09:09.640
Now, she may have
been there, she may

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.587
have watched, but she
is not the girl's killer.

01:09:12.058 --> 01:09:15.237
And this knowledge
arrived at by way of...

01:09:15.913 --> 01:09:20.154
a thumb mark printed in soot.

01:09:22.952 --> 01:09:26.147
You have a confession, Mr. Reid.

01:09:26.442 --> 01:09:28.008
You use it.

01:09:44.794 --> 01:09:46.879
Lady, please.

01:09:46.913 --> 01:09:48.562
It is not too late.

01:09:48.564 --> 01:09:50.163
It is never that.

01:09:50.733 --> 01:09:52.673
Dear Mr. Reid.

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.994
It was always too late.

01:10:26.035 --> 01:10:27.584
Inspector Reid.

01:10:27.586 --> 01:10:30.169
You have the keys, I understand.

01:10:39.982 --> 01:10:42.149
One last question for you, sir.

01:10:42.151 --> 01:10:44.294
What kind of man is it allows his wife

01:10:44.295 --> 01:10:45.853
to go to the rope for him?

01:10:47.026 --> 01:10:49.957
Confess. Know the release.

01:10:49.959 --> 01:10:51.278
Enough!

01:11:06.753 --> 01:11:09.937
That, is a murder solved.

01:11:10.331 --> 01:11:12.092
Your feet not even back under the table

01:11:12.093 --> 01:11:13.532
and a murder solved.

01:11:13.619 --> 01:11:16.784
This shall be spoken of, Edmund.

01:11:25.516 --> 01:11:28.639
All is as it ever was, Mr. Reid.

01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:41.516
Last warning.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:45.333
That is a good drop, Don.

01:11:48.714 --> 01:11:50.272
Good gentlemen,

01:11:50.903 --> 01:11:52.240
I shall see you tomorrow.

01:12:07.086 --> 01:12:08.056
Reid.

01:12:08.058 --> 01:12:09.273
Captain.

01:12:17.731 --> 01:12:19.569
Come on, really?

01:12:23.107 --> 01:12:24.942
You're just gonna sit there

01:12:25.042 --> 01:12:27.499
and we all just pick up
right where we left off?

01:12:30.158 --> 01:12:32.597
I saw you. You were leaving.

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:35.436
You had your girl and you were leaving.

01:12:35.471 --> 01:12:37.519
I was. We were.

01:12:37.521 --> 01:12:38.819
And so?

01:12:40.676 --> 01:12:42.457
Mathilda asks the same.

01:12:43.037 --> 01:12:44.387
I'm sure she does.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.628
I tell her what I tell you.

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:51.366
I... I cannot further account for it.

01:12:55.606 --> 01:12:58.907
I woke from my sleep
knowing only this...

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:00.942
I was not saved so that

01:13:00.944 --> 01:13:03.482
I might go fishing.

01:13:06.784 --> 01:13:07.752
And the event,

01:13:07.787 --> 01:13:09.868
your shooting. You have
any recall of it?

01:13:10.034 --> 01:13:11.035
Little.

01:13:11.588 --> 01:13:13.148
Barely an image.

01:13:14.713 --> 01:13:18.942
But before Obsidian,

01:13:19.997 --> 01:13:22.557
as I stepped into that place,

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:26.394
I've never known fear like it.

01:13:33.878 --> 01:13:35.609
Forgot my hat.

01:13:36.914 --> 01:13:38.959
It's a ridiculous hat.

01:13:39.946 --> 01:13:41.934
Nonetheless.

01:14:46.837 --> 01:14:49.004
Ridiculous.
