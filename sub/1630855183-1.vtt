[grunts]

11:39.208 --> 11:40.708
[Sa See] Every year is the same.

11:40.708 --> 11:42.666
Who'd be interested
in a collection of vases?

11:42.666 --> 11:45.291
I'm twenty now,
and I've never been out of this palace.

11:45.291 --> 11:46.791
I'm tired of these gardens and guards!

11:46.791 --> 11:48.958
Your security is at stake.
You know this well--

11:48.958 --> 11:53.708
Father promised me I would visit Lutetia
all its boutiques, small taverns...

11:53.708 --> 11:55.416
I yearn to travel to Gaul!

11:55.416 --> 11:58.916
We have spoken about this.
Such a journey is too dangerous.

11:58.916 --> 12:00.833
The answer is no.

12:01.541 --> 12:03.125
Here. Open this one.

12:04.916 --> 12:06.791
A gold coin stamped with your likeness.

12:06.791 --> 12:08.041
The first ever minted.

12:08.666 --> 12:11.000
Will it buy a dress
in the capital of Gaul?

12:11.000 --> 12:11.916
Sa See...

12:19.250 --> 12:21.041
[Empress] Prince Deng Tsin Qin!

12:21.541 --> 12:23.625
[mysterious music playing]

12:24.208 --> 12:25.375
I'm told you have levied

12:25.375 --> 12:26.958
a new tax over your kingdom,

12:26.958 --> 12:28.750
whilst your people suffer famine?

12:28.750 --> 12:30.625
If I may be so bold, your Majesty...

12:30.625 --> 12:32.625
Julius Caesar's been taxing the heck out

12:32.625 --> 12:34.708
of his own empire
and nobody's complaining.

12:34.708 --> 12:37.208
Plus, where's the pleasure
without pain, as my countrymen say.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.541
Who is this man?

12:38.541 --> 12:41.625
This is Scar Dee Kat.
My new strategic counsellor.

12:41.625 --> 12:44.791
He's from Rome,
where he held very high station.

12:44.791 --> 12:46.625
Put the people of China

12:46.625 --> 12:48.500
before the twisted schemes of a Roman.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.458
Of course, your Imperial Majesty.

12:52.208 --> 12:53.500
Before I withdraw,

12:53.500 --> 12:56.291
have you given any thought
to my proposal of marriage?

12:56.291 --> 12:58.000
Yes. The Princess and I discussed it.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.125
And...?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.083
We had a good laugh.

13:01.083 --> 13:03.125
[laughter]

13:03.125 --> 13:06.166
[Scar Dee Kat] Ah!
"He who makes woman laugh..." [laughs]

13:07.000 --> 13:08.833
Apologies.

13:09.416 --> 13:11.458
If your Majesty
and her daughter find it amusing,

13:12.250 --> 13:13.791
then let it be so.

13:13.791 --> 13:15.208
[mysterious music playing]

13:19.625 --> 13:20.458
[Empress] Ka Ra Tay.

13:24.166 --> 13:25.500
My faithful warrior.

13:26.166 --> 13:27.583
Summon my daughter.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.500
[lively music playing]

13:51.166 --> 13:52.875
[Ekonomikrisis] Look, we are in China.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.125
The Chinese love all things Gaul,
therefore we are Gauls,

13:55.125 --> 13:56.166
I can't be any clearer.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.708
To a native Phoenician,
it's humiliating, Ekonomikrisis.

13:59.916 --> 14:01.791
The name's <i>Ekonomikrisix</i>!

14:01.791 --> 14:03.208
Get it through your thick skulls!

14:03.208 --> 14:06.041
You're Overmix, and you're Premix! Right?

14:06.041 --> 14:08.500
And all three of us are Gauls.
"Comprendix"?

14:09.083 --> 14:12.000
- It's always us making the effort.
- [Ekonomikrisis] Always you, huh?

14:14.333 --> 14:15.875
- [both laughing]
- Is that funny to you?

14:15.875 --> 14:17.916
Think that's funny? Think I'm amused?

14:17.916 --> 14:19.166
- Being blonde?
- [Overmix] No.

14:19.166 --> 14:22.333
So grab these papyrus sheets,
and go hand them out in town. Stat!

14:22.333 --> 14:24.458
Go on. <i>Yallah</i>, I mean, get on with it.

14:24.458 --> 14:26.458
Put your helmets on! Go!

14:26.458 --> 14:28.291
On your way now.

14:28.291 --> 14:29.750
China is ours, yeah?

14:30.250 --> 14:32.166
Hey, hey, hey. What you snooping at?

14:32.958 --> 14:35.750
What you think you're doing?
You touch, you pay. That's the rule.

14:36.666 --> 14:37.958
Are these real Louboutix?

14:37.958 --> 14:39.750
"Are those real Louboutix?"

14:39.750 --> 14:42.375
Of course they're real,
have you ever seen soles like this before?

14:42.375 --> 14:45.000
They're red-hot, and so are my prices,
so if it's too much,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.208
go check out Cheaptrix next door.

14:47.958 --> 14:49.541
Right, get outta my store now.

14:49.541 --> 14:51.791
- Go on, give us some air.
- [Ekonomikrisis] Whoa!

14:51.791 --> 14:53.791
That's a booboo. Mother of all booboos.

14:53.791 --> 14:55.875
Please forgive him, Majesty. Forgive him.

14:55.875 --> 14:59.666
He's my nephew.
He has the same temper as his mama.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.208
- Right.
- That's what everybody says.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.375
And of course, the sandals are yours.

15:03.375 --> 15:05.416
There's no charge, I'll take it...

15:05.416 --> 15:06.583
- Ow!
- ...out of his wages.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.666
- I felt pain.
- You did have it coming.

15:08.666 --> 15:10.708
Ekonomikrisix, I'm at your service.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.166
[whispering] Nobody shakes.
Put the hand away.

15:13.166 --> 15:14.791
- Nobody shakes.
- Nobody shakes.

15:14.791 --> 15:17.791
This is all a terrible mistake, Princess.

15:17.791 --> 15:21.833
Whoa. You're sublime. Um. Um... um.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.541
I'm Bankruptix. I'm the nephew.

15:23.541 --> 15:25.708
With my Mama's temper.

15:25.708 --> 15:28.583
And also... her eyes.

15:28.583 --> 15:31.458
[swooshing]

15:31.458 --> 15:33.166
I would've loved
to have blonde hair like you.

15:33.166 --> 15:37.125
It was never really my choice, Princess.
I was always this way.

15:37.125 --> 15:38.833
Nature only is to blame.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.750
[clears throat] If your imperial Majesty,

15:40.750 --> 15:42.875
uh, could put all this behind us,

15:42.875 --> 15:46.458
if you would consent to sample
some of our famous Gallic wines,

15:46.458 --> 15:48.500
it would honour us greatly.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.625
[Ekonomikrisis] Do come in.

15:50.625 --> 15:54.750
Let's start with a superior vintage,
to honour your majestic imperiosity.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.666
[sniffs] Its nose is fruity.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.708
Full of sunshine.

16:00.708 --> 16:02.208
Notes of pine and cool shade.

16:02.208 --> 16:04.541
With a tinge of chestnut. [sniffs]

16:04.541 --> 16:05.625
Banana too.

16:05.625 --> 16:07.416
Dried dates, perhaps.

16:07.416 --> 16:10.416
It's more of a fruit salad
than a... a wine, really.

16:10.416 --> 16:11.416
WINE TASTING

16:11.416 --> 16:13.916
[lively music playing]

16:14.708 --> 16:16.000
I LOVE GAUL

16:25.833 --> 16:26.666
I'll buy it all.

16:26.666 --> 16:28.750
- Ah!
- [ding]

16:30.083 --> 16:33.250
- [Sa See] Are these Gallic perfumes?
- Absolutely, they are indeed.

16:33.250 --> 16:35.333
All our perfumes come from Gaul.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.208
Like myself and my staff.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.875
This is the latest fragrance

16:39.875 --> 16:42.791
the ladies are crazy for in Gaul. Amphora.

16:42.791 --> 16:44.833
Amphora.

16:44.833 --> 16:45.916
I adore-a.

16:45.916 --> 16:47.250
And I'm all for-a.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.708
- [Deng Tsin Qin] Archers, fire!
- Hey, watch out!

16:49.708 --> 16:52.000
[screaming]

16:52.000 --> 16:53.916
- [tense music playing]
- [screaming]

16:57.666 --> 16:59.083
Sa See, are you hurt?

16:59.083 --> 17:00.500
No, Mother, I'm fine.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.208
- Bankruptis, everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm all good.

17:03.208 --> 17:04.583
I'm asking about the goods!

17:04.583 --> 17:05.666
Cheers, mate.

17:05.666 --> 17:07.083
[Deng Tsin Qin] Hey, Empress?

17:07.083 --> 17:08.416
Come out with your hands up.

17:08.416 --> 17:11.166
We wouldn't want to hurt anybody.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.250
We got eyes on you!

17:12.250 --> 17:13.666
Yeah, both kinds.

17:15.916 --> 17:18.666
Yeah because...
my eyes are more like, round,

17:18.666 --> 17:20.208
and you guys are, like uh...

17:21.000 --> 17:21.833
Forget it.

17:24.625 --> 17:25.541
Is there another exit?

17:25.541 --> 17:27.208
Yes. I have a secret passage

17:27.208 --> 17:30.041
in case of customs checks.
I mean in case of check...

17:30.041 --> 17:32.625
checking for fires.
In case of fire. A fire exit.

17:33.416 --> 17:35.833
Ka Ra Tay,
I entrust you my daughter. Save her!

17:35.833 --> 17:37.541
Mother, no! You have to escape too.

17:37.541 --> 17:39.666
The Empress does not flee. Save yourself.

17:39.666 --> 17:41.708
The scoundrel is after you.

17:41.708 --> 17:42.625
Let's go.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.000
- [Bankruptis] Bye, Princess.
- Quit that. I'm gonna stay here.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.875
A good merchant never abandons his stock.

17:48.875 --> 17:51.333
Captain of the ship kinda thing, right?

17:51.333 --> 17:52.333
Well, yeah.

17:52.333 --> 17:53.791
You get to home-base,
and bring back the guys.

17:53.791 --> 17:55.166
What? Uncle Mahmood?

17:55.166 --> 17:57.000
Not him, not Uncle Mahmood,
this home base.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.250
This home base?

17:58.250 --> 18:00.541
- That's the other end of the planet!
- You should be on your way.

18:00.541 --> 18:02.541
- [inhales, grunts]
- Hey, wait!

18:03.250 --> 18:06.541
Keep your eyes on the Princess.
We won't lose our biggest sale ever.

18:06.541 --> 18:10.291
Imagine. If you save
the Princess of China...

18:10.291 --> 18:12.000
[soft music playing]

18:14.208 --> 18:16.666
- Ah.
- Ah, yeah.

18:16.666 --> 18:19.000
- Yeah... I'll understand on the way.
- [Ekonomikrisis] Go!

18:19.000 --> 18:20.583
[Bankruptis] Take care, unkie.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.166
[grunts]

18:22.666 --> 18:23.791
[sighs]

18:25.166 --> 18:27.458
I happen to be an amateur pugilist.

18:27.458 --> 18:28.458
Let me deal with this.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.333
- [lively music playing]
- So, fellas?

18:30.333 --> 18:32.416
- Hassling ladies, are we?
- [punch landing]

18:33.208 --> 18:34.458
[groans]

18:35.666 --> 18:36.583
[sighs]

18:37.250 --> 18:39.250
So I left the room, and then...

18:40.291 --> 18:41.250
What happened?

18:41.250 --> 18:44.458
- You got kicked in the head.
- Ah, of course!

18:44.458 --> 18:45.583
That's what happened.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.666
So, are we having fun yet, Empress?

18:47.666 --> 18:48.833
Excuse me just one second,

18:48.833 --> 18:51.333
but who on earth are you?
Because none of this makes much sense.

18:51.333 --> 18:53.208
I'm totally lost, I'm baffled here.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.333
- So then?
- The princess is still missing.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.625
And if she's hiding, she's smart.

18:58.625 --> 19:01.125
Dodging us like a sly little fishy...

19:02.333 --> 19:04.916
Find her, offer a reward!
Tell the whole kingdom!

19:04.916 --> 19:08.000
I want her alive!
For our beautiful forced wedding!

19:08.000 --> 19:10.958
[laughs]

19:10.958 --> 19:12.583
I know my daughter.

19:12.583 --> 19:13.916
She will seek her revenge.

19:13.916 --> 19:16.125
Now that's a scary thought.
Spoiled princess,

19:16.125 --> 19:17.208
who's never been outside!

19:17.208 --> 19:19.333
- That's my bride you're talking about.
- Sorry, Master.

19:19.333 --> 19:21.375
Yeah I'm sorry too,
but tell us what's going on,

19:21.375 --> 19:23.333
I'm so puzzled, as in totally perplexed.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.333
I'll have you decapitated, Empress.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.625
You'll decapitate no one.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.333
Where's your manners?
You don't do that.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.125
He's not wrong,
you can't be the one to kill the Empress.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.500
[Deng Tsin Qin] Why not?

19:32.500 --> 19:36.000
It's not that simple, because the Princes
in the other kingdoms hate your guts.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.708
They claim you're not Emperor material,

19:37.708 --> 19:40.000
and also, their words not mine,
you're physically ugly,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.541
and you've got an itty-bitty little--

19:41.541 --> 19:44.750
- Don't you dare.
- I meant army. You have a small army.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.083
It's the smallest one out there.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.000
If you try to beat them,
you've got zero chance.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.750
[Deng Tsin Qin] I'm assuming you wouldn't
say this unless you had a plan?

19:50.750 --> 19:52.166
Well assumed.

19:53.083 --> 19:54.666
- And my idea--
- Hush!

19:55.500 --> 19:57.958
- Right, haul them in! Let's go!
- No.

19:57.958 --> 19:59.333
- Take it easy.
- [Deng Tsin Qin] Move!

19:59.333 --> 20:02.041
Easy, there's an Empress here,
and the jars are breakable.

20:02.041 --> 20:04.041
[Deng Tsin Qin] China is ours!

20:04.041 --> 20:07.166
- [evil laughter]
- [emotional music playing]

20:27.083 --> 20:28.500
[sobbing]

20:36.000 --> 20:37.500
[Bankruptis] It's gonna be fine, Princess.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.291
And you can count on me. Okay? You and me.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.791
- [mutters in pain]
- [bones cracking]

20:42.791 --> 20:44.416
[Bankruptis] Don't worry. We'll help you!

20:44.416 --> 20:46.083
Because it's a known fact,

20:46.083 --> 20:48.125
us Gauls, we just love helping others.

20:48.125 --> 20:49.583
No!

20:49.583 --> 20:51.458
No, no, no and no!

20:51.458 --> 20:53.083
[Vitalstatistix] Out of the question!

20:53.083 --> 20:56.083
Dunno about you, but I found
this story extremely long-winded.

20:56.083 --> 21:00.916
And frankly, by Belenus, why does everyone
always have to come to us for support?

21:00.916 --> 21:02.916
Hold on now, Vitalstatistix,

21:02.916 --> 21:04.291
it's a tradition.

21:04.291 --> 21:07.000
We provide assistance
to those who need it.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.083
Including our good friend Bank...

21:09.083 --> 21:10.708
- Ruptis.
- ...Ruptis.

21:10.708 --> 21:14.041
- Ruptix.
- Right, well... it's a no, that's it.

21:14.041 --> 21:16.500
It's often been yes.
But this time, it's no.

21:17.125 --> 21:20.083
[Vitalstatistix] I've got a bad feeling.
China's far away, we've never been!

21:20.083 --> 21:21.833
Nor our forefathers!

55:28.750 --> 55:31.125
Likely more complicated.

55:31.125 --> 55:32.875
Our victories have had an impact.

55:32.875 --> 55:34.666
The Ku Koos are tough negotiators.

55:34.666 --> 55:36.083
Very well.

55:36.083 --> 55:37.916
We'll see who is the Ku Kooest.

55:37.916 --> 55:39.541
[laughter]

55:39.541 --> 55:42.625
Yeah, well, sorry not to join the fun,
but old man So Ku Koo died last winter.

55:43.250 --> 55:46.166
Leaving his only son and heir,
Prince Ku Koo, twenty years old

55:46.166 --> 55:49.083
concealed under a bamboo mask
due to a horrible birth defect.

55:49.083 --> 55:51.333
- The Ku Koo Behind the Bamboo.

55:51.333 --> 55:52.250
So he gets orphaned,

55:52.250 --> 55:55.583
gets his butt handed to him by Caesar,
not a good year for the Ku Koos.

55:55.583 --> 55:57.458
- [laughter]
- [Caesar] Come to think of it...

55:59.500 --> 56:01.083
you seem Ku Koo yourself, don't you?

56:01.750 --> 56:04.083
No, I'm a Deng. Of the Deng-Bhat clan.

56:04.083 --> 56:05.375
Yes, but...

56:07.916 --> 56:09.583
you could be Deng' erous, couldn't you?

56:10.166 --> 56:11.833
- Huh?
- [hand clatters]

56:14.166 --> 56:15.875
[tense music playing]

56:15.875 --> 56:18.875

why you would ask me to help

56:18.875 --> 56:20.708
evict you from your own kingdom,

56:20.708 --> 56:22.875
so what's in it for you...

56:22.875 --> 56:25.000
Deng Tsin Qin?

56:26.166 --> 56:28.416
You wouldn't be thinking
about a Caesarian section,

56:28.416 --> 56:30.458
to cut me out of my end of the spoils?

56:30.458 --> 56:33.583
Not at all. Never even crossed my mind.

56:34.208 --> 56:35.166
Really?

56:36.500 --> 56:39.666
It would've crossed mine. [laughs]
Wouldn't bother me in the least!

56:39.666 --> 56:42.125
- [laughter]
- He's on a roll.

56:42.125 --> 56:44.166
[Caesar sighs]

56:44.166 --> 56:46.541
- Tell me, oh Caesar.
- Mm-hmm.

56:46.541 --> 56:47.500
Are you aware that

56:47.500 --> 56:50.291
the great Cleopatra
is highly respected here in China?

56:51.083 --> 56:52.000
[Scar Dee Kat] True.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.375
She's done so much for the defence
and preservation of pandas that now...

56:56.000 --> 56:58.125
So how is she in real life?
Fun to be with?

57:04.375 --> 57:06.000
[soft music playing]

57:13.250 --> 57:15.000
At last, I'm back home.

57:16.208 --> 57:18.958
Do you smell the fragrance of bamboo,
ginger and eucalypt?

57:20.500 --> 57:22.541
Don't bother with these guys,
they wouldn't know.

57:22.541 --> 57:26.458
But I can smell it just fine,
and... so aromatic!

57:27.041 --> 57:28.000
[Bankruptis] Titanix!

57:28.000 --> 57:30.166
Will you be going straight back to Egypt?

57:30.166 --> 57:33.000
Nope. I'll keep sailing
till I return to my starting point,

57:33.000 --> 57:34.625

58:12.708 --> 58:15.541
Ka Ra Tay,
how will we hope to find your master here?

58:15.541 --> 58:17.416
He'll be the one to find us.

58:35.083 --> 58:37.083
- What was the message?
- Nothing.

58:38.416 --> 58:39.708
Friend of yours? The bald guy?

58:41.083 --> 58:43.208
Well, if it's nothing
why can't you tell me what it is?

58:45.041 --> 58:48.833
My master, Sill Lee, awaits us tonight
in an inn where we will spend the night.

58:48.833 --> 58:52.291
There you go. Just say it,
instead of acting all mysterious.

58:52.291 --> 58:53.666
I'm not even hungry anymore!

58:54.291 --> 58:55.458

58:55.458 --> 58:56.625
[Astérix] What the...

58:56.625 --> 58:58.583
Never seen him like that.

58:59.625 --> 59:01.541
He's probably just tired, that's all.

59:01.541 --> 59:03.666
There's a culture shock,
it's a lot to take in.

59:03.666 --> 59:06.083
- Do you mind if I speak candidly?
- Mm.

59:06.083 --> 59:09.750
You and me, we're not the best of friends.
I hate you, I believe you hate me too.

59:09.750 --> 59:10.958
Mm-hmm.

59:10.958 --> 59:13.500
But the two of you,
things are getting very tense.

59:13.500 --> 59:15.791
The tension's spreading
through the whole group.

59:15.791 --> 59:17.333
- That bad?
- Yeah.

59:18.125 --> 59:19.500
But I got something for both of you

59:19.500 --> 59:24.000
and I'm sure it can bring some changes,
for the better.

59:26.291 --> 59:28.333
[Astérix] Obélix. We need to talk.

59:28.833 --> 59:29.875
[Obélix] I'm listening.

59:29.875 --> 59:33.791
There's a beautiful story
starting between the Princess and me.

59:33.791 --> 59:35.000
Oh?

59:35.791 --> 59:36.708
Well, yeah.

59:38.333 --> 59:40.916
And I believe it'd be simpler if, like...

59:41.500 --> 59:43.500
if she were to live with us,
in the village.

59:43.500 --> 59:44.625
Okay.

59:45.500 --> 59:48.916
Of course, you and I have been housemates
for a long time.

59:49.416 --> 59:52.125
Uh, but we never said it'd be forever.

59:53.125 --> 59:54.708
And as it happens,

59:54.708 --> 59:56.791
the hut belonged to my parents.

59:57.291 --> 59:58.375
So, uh...

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.541
You want me to move out then?

01:00:03.583 --> 01:00:05.041
- Yes.
- [sighs]

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.083
Oh, Astérix!
I can't tell you how relieved I am.

01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:14.000
I wanted to leave too, but I didn't know
how to tell you, I just couldn't tell you.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:14.916
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:17.458 --> 01:00:18.958
I've fallen in love too.

01:00:20.541 --> 01:00:21.875
You're in love?

- Why are you laughing?

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:39.208

Come on, Oby...

01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:43.708

I'm not allowed to fall in love?
I'm not allowed anything!

I don't even get the privilege of roasting
my wild boars in my own fireplace!

Except it's not my own fireplace
'cause Astérix's parents built it!

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
- Which they did.
- Astérix wants me to eat fruit and veg!

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.625
And why do I want us to eat fruits
and vegetables?

01:01:16.625 --> 01:01:18.958
For you! For you to eat better.

01:01:18.958 --> 01:01:21.125
Do not say the word. Don't say that word!

01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:23.375

01:06:53.958 --> 01:06:54.958
[Caesar] I go off to war,

risk my life, nothing from her.

01:06:58.458 --> 01:07:01.875
No messenger, no news,
no papyrus-card, not even a pigeon.

01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:03.958
Ah, you need to get a hold of yourself.

01:07:03.958 --> 01:07:06.875
You were being so strong,
bristling with rage,

01:07:06.875 --> 01:07:08.208
but now I see nothing.

01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:09.250
[Risklus] He's right.

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:10.875
Did you send her a message?

01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.833
No! We said, enough of the messages.

01:07:12.833 --> 01:07:14.875
We're stone-wall marble,
we give her nothing.

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:16.791
We let her soak in her marinade,
like octopus.

01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:18.916
Hey, Dainty, better tone it down.

01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:20.875
What's that you say, Señor Grunt?

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:24.291
Infamous Risklus, how about
"Witless," with a head like an aqueduct?

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:27.416
You think you're Antivirus, don't you?
You couldn't even shine his sandals.

01:07:27.416 --> 01:07:29.166
<i>Así que callate la boca!</i>

01:07:31.666 --> 01:07:32.791
[Biopix] Caesar.

01:07:32.791 --> 01:07:35.833
Tell me who wears the toga in the palace.
Eh? Who's the boss?

01:07:36.458 --> 01:07:38.416
- I am.
- Anyone hear that?

01:07:39.583 --> 01:07:41.166
Who's the boss at home?

01:07:41.166 --> 01:07:43.041
[sighs] I'm the boss.

01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:44.000
There you are.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.583
Now you're talking. That is our Caesar.
That's our champion. <i>Numero uno!</i>

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.208
So if there's a message you gotta send,

01:07:50.208 --> 01:07:52.291
just tell her to pack
her bags and all that,

01:07:52.291 --> 01:07:56.208
and take herself right back to Egypt,
show her profile or whatever, she is out.

01:08:00.166 --> 01:08:01.458
Fair enough. Write.

01:08:01.458 --> 01:08:03.541

01:08:18.708 --> 01:08:21.875
"Starting from today,
you'll know who wears the toga at home."

01:08:21.875 --> 01:08:22.875
[Biopix] There you go.

01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:24.208
"You've been told. Hail me."

01:08:24.208 --> 01:08:25.625
[Biopix] That's better.

01:08:25.625 --> 01:08:28.500
That's my sizzling Caesar,
that was masterly.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.250

It's relaxing.

01:29:20.041 --> 01:29:22.458
Golly. As in Gauls.

01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:36.166
So, is it my turn?

01:29:36.166 --> 01:29:37.500
Yeah, sure, if you want.

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:38.583
Archers!

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:40.916
Aim!

01:29:40.916 --> 01:29:42.458
Draw!

01:29:42.458 --> 01:29:43.958
Fire!

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.666
Deng Tsin Qin, Emperor of China!
[laughs]

01:29:48.666 --> 01:29:50.250
[mysterious music playing]

01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:51.541
Arrows!

01:29:59.291 --> 01:30:01.291
[screams]

01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:07.250
Come on. Seriously?

01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:09.916
Don't judge. Ah!

01:30:11.291 --> 01:30:12.333
I can feel it.

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:15.833
The kick is a monster. Ah!

01:30:15.833 --> 01:30:18.083
[yelling]

01:30:18.083 --> 01:30:19.208
Crazy force!

01:30:19.208 --> 01:30:20.583
Oh...

01:30:20.583 --> 01:30:23.916
Is that all? Is this all? Argh!

01:30:23.916 --> 01:30:26.875
No! I can't believe it. This is pathetic!

01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:30.708
[soldier yelling]

01:30:36.791 --> 01:30:39.208
- I smell victory.
- Ah, smells of victory.

01:30:39.208 --> 01:30:40.958
A specific smell, would you say?

01:30:42.208 --> 01:30:44.291
Readers care about that sort of detail?

01:30:44.291 --> 01:30:45.708
It flavours the experience.

01:30:47.458 --> 01:30:49.166
It reeks of laurel then.

01:30:49.166 --> 01:30:52.375
Excellent. Excellent!

01:30:52.375 --> 01:30:54.291

01:31:14.125 --> 01:31:15.083
Thank you.

01:31:15.083 --> 01:31:16.333
You're welcome.

01:31:16.333 --> 01:31:17.583
[screams]

01:31:19.666 --> 01:31:21.583
I won't not help you
just 'cause we've argued.

01:31:22.166 --> 01:31:23.000
I know.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.083
- I've always said I'd defend you.
- [screams]

01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:26.750
I know.

01:31:28.041 --> 01:31:30.166
Because you'll always be my best mate.

01:31:32.875 --> 01:31:33.833
I know.

01:31:34.916 --> 01:31:36.250
Sorry, Obélix.

01:31:39.125 --> 01:31:41.250
[Sa See] Astérix! Obélix!

[Obélix grunts]

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.166
Obélix! Don't!

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:03.916
Don't.

01:32:14.208 --> 01:32:16.500
[laughs]

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:21.166
Before we die,
I need to tell you something, Princess.

- [soft music playing]
- [hoof steps approaching]

01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:30.166
[epic music playing]

01:32:47.208 --> 01:32:48.041
Look there!

01:32:49.875 --> 01:32:51.583
[narrator] <i>And just when all seemed lost,</i>

01:32:52.416 --> 01:32:53.791

[soft music playing]

01:33:21.416 --> 01:33:23.333
- What the heck is that?
- I'm not sure.

01:33:23.333 --> 01:33:26.041
But I don't smell
a lot of laurel right now.

01:33:26.541 --> 01:33:29.083
More like pine caskets.

[horn hoots]

01:33:34.583 --> 01:33:36.083
Caesar!

01:33:36.083 --> 01:33:38.291
I am the Empress of China.

01:33:38.291 --> 01:33:40.916
You will leave my empire forthwith.
I order you.

01:33:40.916 --> 01:33:43.458
- [laughs]
- Never!

01:33:43.458 --> 01:33:45.708
Woman of character. Reminds me of someone.

01:33:45.708 --> 01:33:46.833
Ooh...

01:33:47.708 --> 01:33:49.125
Your Majesty,

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:52.000
rather than lose our temper
and ruin everything,

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.708
perhaps we could consider
some sort of alliance?

01:33:54.708 --> 01:33:57.625
When the clouds pass in front of the sun,

01:33:57.625 --> 01:34:00.041
my army will trample you to dust.

01:34:00.916 --> 01:34:03.541
What's that now, another proverb of yours?

01:34:03.541 --> 01:34:06.333
Oh no, it's literal.
And it's happening now.

01:34:07.625 --> 01:34:09.291
[dramatic music playing]

01:34:12.041 --> 01:34:14.541
- How many of you are there?
- [gasps] Watch him do his thing!

01:34:15.166 --> 01:34:17.375
One million.

[music distorts and fades out]

01:34:19.625 --> 01:34:22.250
Ah. The maths don't work as well.

01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:23.208
[sighs]

01:34:23.208 --> 01:34:25.666
Boys, I'm gonna hit the road.
It's not like I'm from here.

01:34:25.666 --> 01:34:27.458
I'm returning to Rome, so keep in touch.

01:34:27.458 --> 01:34:31.291
But Caesar, you can't just bail on us!
There's a million of them!

01:34:32.083 --> 01:34:33.500
It's not my war.

[off-key horn playing]

01:34:38.833 --> 01:34:40.583
I can't just trot off.

[whistles] Hi-ho, Equus!

01:34:45.541 --> 01:34:46.958
Hi-ho. Now. [snaps fingers]

[coos and vibrates]

01:34:55.791 --> 01:34:56.916
GOT YOUR MESSAGE!

SAY GOODBYE TO MY LITTLE PYRAMID!
CLEOPATRA

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
[sighs] That's one rough day.

01:35:03.625 --> 01:35:04.458
A rough one.

01:35:05.375 --> 01:35:06.416
Right.

01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:11.916
Hurray!

Hurray!

01:35:51.916 --> 01:35:57.958
<i>but also to hold a celebration
in honour of Gaul and China.</i>

01:35:59.833 --> 01:36:03.291
Your attention,
the Empress will be speaking now.

01:36:04.541 --> 01:36:05.583
Valiant warriors,

01:36:06.666 --> 01:36:08.541
my gratitude is eternal.

01:36:09.208 --> 01:36:10.916
[Vitalstatistix]
Our honour, Your Majesty.

01:36:10.916 --> 01:36:13.750
In fact, I'm the one who insisted
we rush to your aid.

01:36:15.166 --> 01:36:17.000
We have come all this way today

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.041
to celebrate a beautiful union.

01:36:19.041 --> 01:36:21.250
[soft music playing]

01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:30.500
That's my cousin. Remix's the name.

01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.375
He's a specialist of world music!

01:36:32.375 --> 01:36:36.000
He's my cousin, he's mine, all mine.
He is not, at all, your cousin, he's my--

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.166
- Shush!
- [scoffs]

01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:11.416
[muffled protest]

01:37:22.625 --> 01:37:25.125
[Vitalstatistix] You know,
we're a bit alike, me and you.

01:37:25.125 --> 01:37:26.333
We're chiefs.

01:37:26.333 --> 01:37:29.041
I believe wielding power
gets pretty lonely.

01:37:29.041 --> 01:37:30.375
Wouldn't you say so?

01:37:32.666 --> 01:37:34.666
And... I'm not done.

01:37:34.666 --> 01:37:38.083
And what's more, behind every great man,
there's a great woman.

01:37:38.083 --> 01:37:41.166
Without Impedimenta, I'm lost.
At home, she's wearing the moustache.

01:37:41.166 --> 01:37:43.916
Not interrupting, am I? Having a nice day?

01:37:43.916 --> 01:37:46.250
[Impedimenta] Huh?
We'll settle this at home.

01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:48.833
- [tutting]
- Hey, Mimenta!

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:52.041
Excuse me.
Just some minor marital strife to settle.

01:37:52.625 --> 01:37:54.666
Mimenta! Mimenta!

01:37:54.666 --> 01:37:56.833
[sighs] I thought he would never leave.

01:37:59.041 --> 01:38:02.125
You know what? When you left the cell,
I recovered my head.

01:38:02.708 --> 01:38:03.583
Mm.

01:38:03.583 --> 01:38:06.541
What I lost, though,
was my poor little heart.

01:38:07.125 --> 01:38:08.791
- Oh, don't be silly.
- [both giggle]

01:38:08.791 --> 01:38:11.541
And so, what have you done with it?

01:38:13.916 --> 01:38:15.208
See that, Bankruptis?

01:38:15.208 --> 01:38:17.541
Huh? Prison didn't stop
your unkie's oo-la-la!

01:38:17.541 --> 01:38:19.541
[laughs] High class.

01:38:20.541 --> 01:38:21.708
[barking]

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:27.333
Hey. Bring another plate.

01:38:27.333 --> 01:38:29.458
Or even better, a big dish, okay?
Wanna share?

01:38:29.458 --> 01:38:32.250
- No. I'm not gonna give in now.
- Right, sorry.

01:38:33.625 --> 01:38:35.625
So you still don't miss it?

01:38:35.625 --> 01:38:37.291
Why would I miss it?

01:38:37.291 --> 01:38:40.000
I tell you,
I can't even stand the smell now.

01:38:41.333 --> 01:38:43.916
What I might miss sometimes
is the midnight snack, you know?

01:38:44.541 --> 01:38:46.416
After a barley beer or two,
it gets complicated.

01:38:47.875 --> 01:38:48.875
Obélix?

01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:51.000
Panacea.

01:38:51.541 --> 01:38:52.375
Am I in the way?

01:38:52.375 --> 01:38:53.833
- No.
- [Panacea] I am.

01:38:53.833 --> 01:38:56.500
I can tell.
Since you're back, I'm invisible.

01:38:57.916 --> 01:39:00.583
Are the rumours true, about you and her?

01:39:01.375 --> 01:39:02.500
This is ridiculous.

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.666
Long distance relationships don't work.

01:39:04.666 --> 01:39:07.583
Think about the situation.
'Cause I'm here.

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.875
Been waiting for months, worried to death,

01:39:10.875 --> 01:39:12.625
while you were chasing another woman?

01:39:13.416 --> 01:39:14.458
Do you not love me?

01:39:14.458 --> 01:39:16.750
- Huh?
- [Panacea] Well do you or don't you?

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:19.833
You used to love me.
So is it a yes or a no?

01:39:19.833 --> 01:39:21.875
- [Panacea] Do I have to forget you?
- Tell her yes.

01:39:21.875 --> 01:39:23.208
Listen, Panacea... Pff...

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:25.125
it's not happening.

01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:28.375
This village goes
from one adventure to another.

01:39:29.625 --> 01:39:32.958
And it's time I did as well.
That's all. Nothing personal.

01:39:34.041 --> 01:39:35.875
Now if you'll excuse me...

01:39:35.875 --> 01:39:36.875
You're a fool.

01:39:38.666 --> 01:39:41.041
But, uh, I'm still...

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.916
[soft konghou playing]

Nice party, huh?

01:42:05.125 --> 01:42:07.250
I thought everyone had a good time.

01:42:08.625 --> 01:42:10.250
It was a good party.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.125
So Ka Ra Tay, she... she left, didn't she?

01:42:15.125 --> 01:42:17.125
Well, yeah, long ride home.

01:42:19.083 --> 01:42:20.708
She called me her sweetheart.

01:42:20.708 --> 01:42:21.916
[soft music playing]

01:42:21.916 --> 01:42:23.208
She did?

01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:25.541
That's amazing, Oby.

01:42:25.541 --> 01:42:28.208
And so, she didn't...
she didn't feel like staying?

01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:30.041
Well, she wanted to, of course, but...

01:42:30.666 --> 01:42:33.791
she's got work in China,
big responsibilities in the palace.

01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:37.625
No big deal, it'll happen.
When we grow up.

01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:39.583
When you grow up?

01:42:39.583 --> 01:42:41.416
Well... yeah.

01:42:42.125 --> 01:42:42.958
Well...

01:42:43.625 --> 01:42:45.791
I'm tired, I'm gonna go to bed.

[Obélix yawns]

- Hey, Oby?
- Hmm?

01:42:50.666 --> 01:42:52.000
One more for the road, then?

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.166
- Oh, don't mind if I do!
- [chuckles]
