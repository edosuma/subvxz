THERE'S NO WAY THAT
THAT IS GONNA WIN THIS THING.

THAT MUCH TRAUMA

04:34.691 --> 04:36.526

04:36.609 --> 04:38.152
{\an8}SHADING, COLOR PACKING,

{\an8}AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES

SOLID, FUNDAMENTAL TATTOOS.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.850

SOMEBODY HOME

05:08.933 --> 05:10.059
WE DIDN'T WANT TO SEND HOME,

05:10.143 --> 05:11.060
BUT THE WAY
THAT TATTOO TURNED OUT,

05:11.144 --> 05:14.689
THERE WAS NO WAY TO SAVE THAT.

05:14.772 --> 05:17.066
- CAUSING SOMEONE
THAT MUCH TRAUMA ON THEIR SKIN

05:17.150 --> 05:18.568
IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.403

WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY, LATER.

MUST TAG TEAM.

05:59.150 --> 05:59.984
- WHAT?

06:00.068 --> 06:02.195
- ONLY ONE OF YOU
CAN TATTOO AT A TIME,

06:02.278 --> 06:04.697
AND YOU MUST SWITCH ARTISTS
EVERY HOUR.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.074
- [bleep].

06:06.157 --> 06:08.034
{\an8}IT'S RISKY
DOING A TAG TEAM TATTOO,

06:08.117 --> 06:10.578
{\an8}BECAUSE ONCE THE TATTOO MACHINE
IS OUT OF YOUR HAND,

06:10.661 --> 06:12.914
{\an8}YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

06:12.997 --> 06:14.123
IT'S BAD.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.585
- YOU'LL NEED SOLID FUNDAMENTALS
TO CREATE A PERFECT TATTOO

06:17.668 --> 06:21.422
THAT LOOKS LIKE ONE ARTIST
DESIGNED IT AND TATTOOED IT,

06:21.506 --> 06:24.258
AND YOU'LL BE JUDGED AS A TEAM.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.969
{\an8}- WHAT?

06:27.053 --> 06:30.389

06:34.477 --> 06:38.231
CANVASES, PLEASE TELL US
WHAT TATTOO YOU WANT

06:38.314 --> 06:39.524
AND WHERE YOU WANT IT.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.525

06:40.608 --> 06:43.319
- I WANT TO GET AN EAGLE
ON MY UPPER BACK.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.238

06:45.321 --> 06:46.322
- A LIGHTHOUSE ON MY THIGH.

06:46.405 --> 06:49.492

SKULLS RANDOMLY

06:49.575 --> 06:50.827

06:50.910 --> 06:53.079
- RANDOMLY?
- RANDOMLY.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.038

WHO I'M GONNA GET STUCK WITH.

06:54.122 --> 06:57.166
{\an8}THIS COULD BE A DISASTER.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.043
OH, MY GOD, I'M SWEATING.

09:25.731 --> 09:26.691
SHE'S NOT
A STRONG TATTOO ARTIST.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.567
SHE LACKS A LOT
OF FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.152
SHE COULD BE A BIG BURDEN ON US.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.028
- AS SOON AS YOU SAID "EAGLE,"

09:31.112 --> 09:32.613
I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, DUDE,
THAT'S IT."

09:32.697 --> 09:35.825
{\an8}- MY MAIN IDEA,
I WANTED THE LIGHTHOUSE SCENE

09:35.908 --> 09:37.243
{\an8}INSIDE OF THE GLASS BOTTLE.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.828
{\an8}- THE ONLY THING THAT'S
THROWING THIS OUT OF WHACK

09:38.911 --> 09:40.579
{\an8}FOR TRADITIONAL AMERICANA
IS THE BOTTLE.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.832
{\an8}- AARON'S GONNA TAKE THE LEAD
ON THIS,

09:42.915 --> 09:45.334
{\an8}AND I DON'T DEAL WELL WITH
PEOPLE TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.252
{\an8}YOU COULD EVEN DO, LIKE,
A ROSE WITH THAT BEHIND IT.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.336
{\an8}- IT'S COOL, BUT IT'S WRONG.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.713
{\an8}- WORKING ON A TATTOO IN A TEAM,

09:48.796 --> 09:53.050
{\an8}I DON'T HAVE CONTROL
OVER WHETHER I GO HOME OR NOT.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.844
{\an8}- WE HAVE TO DO
THESE CLIPPER [bleep] PERFECT.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.471
{\an8}IT HAS TO HAVE EVERY MAST,
EVERY SAIL, EVERY--

09:57.555 --> 09:59.807
{\an8}- I ALSO WANT OTHER THINGS
INCORPORATED INTO IT.

09:59.890 --> 10:00.975
{\an8}- YOU DO?
- MAYBE A MERMAID.

10:01.058 --> 10:01.934
{\an8}- WHAT?

10:02.018 --> 10:04.562
{\an8}I'LL BE DAMNED
IF I'M GONNA LET SOME CANVAS

10:04.645 --> 10:06.564
{\an8}COME IN HERE
AND START DICKING WITH ME,

10:06.647 --> 10:08.691
{\an8}ESPECIALLY WHEN I GOT
TWO OTHER PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.861
{\an8}- WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE
TO MAYBE ADD SPARROWS?

10:11.944 --> 10:14.697
{\an8}- IF WE ADD SPARROWS,
IT'S GONNA BE OUT OF PROPORTION.

10:14.780 --> 10:15.281
{\an8}IT'S ALWAYS THE HOT CHICKS.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.657
{\an8}WHY ARE THEY SO PICKY?

10:16.741 --> 10:19.368
{\an8}IT'S LIKE THEY'VE NEVER BEEN
TOLD "NO" IN THEIR LIFE.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.786
THAT'S AMERICAN TRADITIONAL.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.663
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE,
AND YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.082
IF THIS CANVAS
KEEPS MICROMANAGING OUR TATTOO,

10:25.166 --> 10:27.960
IT'S GONNA SCREW
THIS WHOLE THING.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.047
- IT'D BE NICE OF HER
TO SHOW UP.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.215
{\an8}WHERE THE HELL IS EMILY?

10:33.299 --> 10:36.886
- [sobbing]
[bleep].

10:36.969 --> 10:38.888
- I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT
WE CAN KNOCK THIS OUT.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.681
- YEAH, IF IT'S JUST ME AND YOU,
WE COULD DO IT.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.641
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE EMILY IS.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.101
SO THERE'S
A COUPLE MISTAKES HERE.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.062
I HAVE TO CARRY
THIS ENTIRE TEAM,

10:46.145 --> 10:47.688
AND ONE OF THE TEAMMATES
ISN'T EVEN HERE.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.403
- I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD MOVE THE ROSE.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.739
THAT'S GONNA CREATE A HUGE
[bleep] MESS AND WAY MORE WORK.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.700
IT JUST PISSES ME OFF.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.169
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TAG TEAM TATTOO.

11:10.252 --> 11:13.130
YOU'LL BE JUDGED
ON YOUR FUNDAMENTALS AS A TEAM.

11:13.214 --> 11:17.385
YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

11:18.386 --> 11:21.472
- LOOKS STRAIGHT TO ME.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.808
- IN AMERICAN TRADITIONAL
TATTOOING,

11:23.891 --> 11:25.601
THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM
FOR ERROR.

11:25.684 --> 11:29.605
{\an8}THESE ARE VERY SIMPLE, BOLD,
PLAIN DESIGNS THAT STAND OUT.

11:29.688 --> 11:30.815
I FEEL LIKE ALL THESE ARTISTS,

11:30.898 --> 11:31.482
IF THEY HAVE
STRONG FUNDAMENTALS,

11:31.565 --> 11:33.943
THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME IDEA

11:34.026 --> 11:36.862
OF WHAT THESE TATTOOS
ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.490
- DOING ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.242
FEELS PRETTY GOOD, ACTUALLY.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.285
{\an8}- I'M THE LEADER OF THIS TEAM.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.703
THERE WE GO.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.205
I PUT MYSELF FIRST
BECAUSE I DO THE BEST LINE WORK.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.332
CRIS IS GONNA GO SECOND

11:48.416 --> 11:50.960
BECAUSE HIS COLOR FILL
IS CLEAN AND SOLID,

11:51.043 --> 11:53.963
AND DON IS GOING THIRD
BECAUSE DON SUCKS.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.765
- [bleep].
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

12:04.849 --> 12:06.851
DID YOU HURT YOURSELF, OR--

12:06.934 --> 12:08.936
{\an8}- THE ONLY THING
THAT I CAN THINK OF TO HAVE

12:09.019 --> 12:14.024
{\an8}THIS MUCH PAIN IS SOMETHING
THAT I DEALT WITH YEARS AGO.

12:17.153 --> 12:21.824
AND IT HURTS A LOT.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.826
I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE EXCUSES.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.162
I'M NOT HERE TO SAY,
"WOE IS ME."

12:26.245 --> 12:27.663
I'M HERE TO TATTOO.

12:27.746 --> 12:28.789
UGH.
- HAS THIS HAPPENED BEFORE?

12:28.873 --> 12:30.374
IS IT SOMETHING
THAT GOES AWAY, COMES BACK?

12:30.458 --> 12:32.251
IS IT, LIKE, AN ALL-DAY THING?

12:32.334 --> 12:35.963
- SOMETIMES IT'S LESS,
AND SOMETIMES IT'S MORE.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.840
THIS TIME IT'S REALLY BAD.

12:37.923 --> 12:41.552
RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE'S
STABBING ME FROM THE INSIDE.

12:41.635 --> 12:45.389
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING
TO BE ABLE TO TATTOO TODAY.

12:45.473 --> 12:49.018
UGH, GOD.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.729
{\an8}- MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.481
{\an8}- DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHERE THE [bleep] I SHOULD GO.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.900
- CLEARLY THESE ARE TEAMS
OF THREE.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.860
HOW ARE WE GONNA CHOOSE
WHO TO SEND HOME?

12:57.943 --> 12:59.862
- THERE'S NO CLEAR BOTTOM.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.031
- THE DECISION IS YOURS.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.915
- I'M IN SO MUCH [bleep] PAIN
RIGHT NOW.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.209
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO JUST WORK THROUGH IT.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.627
I'M STILL GONNA GO IN THERE.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.130
I'M STILL GONNA [bleep] TATTOO.

13:18.214 --> 13:21.884
THIS IS THE MOST PAIN I'VE BEEN
IN IN A REALLY LONG TIME,

13:21.967 --> 13:23.719
BUT I'M NOT GOING HOME.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.846
I'M NOT GONNA BE
IN THE BOTTOM AGAIN.

13:25.930 --> 13:29.058
I'M HERE TO [bleep] TATTOO,
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

13:32.436 --> 13:35.439
{\an8}- FEELING ANY BETTER?

13:35.523 --> 13:37.733
{\an8}I'M GONNA
ASK YOU TO LOAD UP MY MACHINE.

13:37.816 --> 13:41.403
{\an8}- YOUR MACHINE'S NOT SET UP?
- NO.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.031
{\an8}- AND THE OSCAR
FOR MOST DRAMATIC ACTING

13:44.114 --> 13:46.992
{\an8}GOES TO EMILY
FOR ALL HER BULL[bleep] EXCUSES.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.412
ARE YOU GONNA BE DOING
JUST THE BLACK SHADING?

13:50.496 --> 13:51.497
- YEP.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.041
- I'M HERE TO WIN $100,000
AND BECOME INK MASTER.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.292
YOU COULD CUT MY LEG OFF
TOMORROW.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.502
{\an8}I'D STILL BE HERE TATTOOING,

13:56.585 --> 13:58.254
{\an8}NOT CRYING ABOUT A LITTLE PAIN
I HAVE,

13:58.337 --> 14:01.882
{\an8}SO MAN UP AND DO A TATTOO.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.970
- SEE THAT DIDN'T LINE UP
HERE PERFECTLY?

14:06.053 --> 14:07.304
CHECK THIS OUT.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.722
{\an8}CLIPPER SHIPS HAVE
A TON OF LINES

14:08.806 --> 14:10.307
{\an8}THAT HAVE TO BE DONE PERFECT,

14:10.391 --> 14:13.561
{\an8}AND I JUST SCREWED ONE UP
ON THE BOOTY LAST WEEK.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.688
- ALL THE SAILS ARE COMING JUST
RIGHT OFF THE FRONT OF THE SHIP.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.774
WHERE'S THE BACK OF THE SHIP?

14:18.857 --> 14:19.483
- I'VE GOT TO REDEEM MYSELF.

14:19.567 --> 14:23.445
I'VE GOT TO DO A CLEAN SHIP.

14:23.529 --> 14:27.950
- AND SWITCH ARTISTS,
FIVE HOURS REMAINING.

14:28.033 --> 14:28.951
- YOU IN, DOG.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.329
- TAP ME IN, COACH.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.956
- WHEW.
THAT WAS ROUGH.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.749
- WE GOT IT DONE, THOUGH.

14:35.833 --> 14:36.792
{\an8}- I JUST KILLED IT IN THAT HOUR,

14:36.875 --> 14:38.586
{\an8}AND IF ERIK
CAN KEEP THAT PACE UP, WELL,

14:38.669 --> 14:40.588
{\an8}THEN WE'RE DOING GREAT.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.381
JUST WHIP IT OUT OFF THE LINE,

14:42.464 --> 14:43.340
AND THEN THAT'LL BE
YOUR STARTING POINT,

14:43.424 --> 14:45.092
AND KEEP THAT GOING
ALL THE WAY ACROSS.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.261
WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE BULK
OF THE WORK DONE

14:47.344 --> 14:51.432
SO THAT
TY'ESHA'S GOT LESS TO MESS UP.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.522
- [clears throat]

15:00.524 --> 15:04.403
{\an8}ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO
I CAME UP AS POSITIVE

15:04.486 --> 15:07.740
{\an8}FOR EARLY CANCER.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.576
{\an8}I COULD HAVE CANCER RIGHT NOW
AND NOT KNOW IT,

15:10.659 --> 15:12.911
{\an8}AND THAT'S WHY I PUT ON
SUCH A TOUGH EXTERIOR,

15:12.995 --> 15:14.997
{\an8}BECAUSE INSIDE, I'M SCREAMING.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.166
I'M TERRIFIED,

15:17.249 --> 15:18.292
BUT I HAVE TO BE STRONG,

15:18.375 --> 15:21.920
SO I CAN KEEP TATTOOING
AND DOING WHAT I LOVE.

15:22.004 --> 15:25.841
- ONCE AGAIN, SWITCH ARTISTS.

15:25.924 --> 15:28.594
- JUST KEEP WHIPPING
TILL YOU GET MORE DOTS.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.304
THAT MIDDLE LINE
DOWN THERE IS GONNA BE RED.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.139
- GOT IT.

15:32.222 --> 15:35.976
{\an8}MARK THINKS HE'S THIS LEGENDARY
TATTOOER, WHEN IN REALITY,

15:36.060 --> 15:39.521
{\an8}I HAVE TO CLEAN UP ALL THE
SHADING THAT MARK COULDN'T GET.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.357
- YEAH, MAYBE A LITTLE FATTER
AT THE BASE.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.733
- YEP.
HE NEEDS TO JUST

15:42.816 --> 15:44.068
SHUT THE [bleep] UP...

15:44.151 --> 15:45.027
- LESS IS MORE.

15:45.110 --> 15:45.694
- LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE...

15:45.778 --> 15:47.696
- SO THAT NEEDS TO BE BLACK.

15:47.780 --> 15:52.284
- AND LET ME JUST
[bleep] TATTOO.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.202
{\an8}- WATCHING TY'ESHA TATTOO,

15:53.285 --> 15:55.079
{\an8}I JUST FEEL LIKE JUMPING
OVER THE TABLE

15:55.162 --> 15:57.039
{\an8}AND JUST GRABBING THAT MACHINE
OUT OF HER HANDS.

15:57.122 --> 16:00.876
GET IN TIGHT, AND MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S ALL SOLID AND STUFF.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.002
NO, NO, NOT DOWN.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.671
THIS WAY.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.215
I DIDN'T WORK SO HARD
TO GET HERE TO LET TY'ESHA

16:06.298 --> 16:08.676
SCREW MY DESTINY.

16:08.759 --> 16:12.388
- SWITCH ARTISTS, FINAL HOUR.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.847
- ALL RIGHT.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.391
- ALL RIGHT, MISTER MAN,
YOU GOT THIS.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.476
- YOU GUYS RELAX.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.770
I'M JUST GONNA NITPICK THE HELL
OUT OF IT.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.648
{\an8}THIS TEAM IS THE KISS OF DEATH.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.817
I ABSOLUTELY JUST WANT THE LINES
TO LOOK 100%.

16:24.900 --> 16:29.238
ANGEL HAD A ROUGH TIME
ON HIS LINES.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.574
AT THIS POINT, I DON'T EVEN FEEL
LIKE I GET TO TATTOO TODAY.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.951
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE JANITOR

16:34.034 --> 16:36.745
WHO HAS TO CLEAN UP
EVERYBODY ELSE'S MESS.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.914
- FIVE, FOUR,

16:38.997 --> 16:42.876
THREE, TWO, ONE.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.461
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.923
TIME IS UP.
NO MORE TATTOOING.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.843
- DAMN, THAT LOOKS SICK,
FOR REAL.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.512
- THAT LOOKS AMAZING.
- LIKE IT?

16:53.595 --> 16:55.097
- OH, MY GOD, I LOVE HER.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.057
SHE'S PERFECT.

16:57.141 --> 16:57.850
- YOU GUYS DID SUCH A GOOD JOB.

16:57.933 --> 17:00.144
YOU CAN SEE THAT
FROM A MILE AWAY.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.687
- THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF STUFF LIKE THIS,

17:01.770 --> 17:03.731
'CAUSE EVEN STANDING BACK HERE,
SEE THE GAPS BETWEEN THE WATER

17:03.814 --> 17:06.400
AND THE ACTUAL LAND,
THEY CREATE THAT DIMENSION.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.526
- I HAD CONFIDENCE
IN AARON DOING THIS OUTLINE,

17:07.608 --> 17:09.944
BUT IT LOOKS SO BAD.

17:10.028 --> 17:13.198
{\an8}I MEAN, I MIGHT BE JUDGED FOR
SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T EVEN DO.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.077
- WHAT HAPPENED TODAY, EMILY?

17:17.161 --> 17:18.078
WE THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA HAVE
TO DO THE TATTOO WITHOUT YOU.

17:18.162 --> 17:22.458
- I'M SORRY
THAT I DISAPPEARED LIKE THAT.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.461
I'M JUST IN A LOAD OF PAIN
RIGHT NOW,

17:25.544 --> 17:28.839
BUT I WASN'T GOING
TO NOT TATTOO.

17:28.922 --> 17:29.840
- WASN'T REALLY UP TO PAR,
THOUGH.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.634
I KNOW YOU'RE IN PAIN,
BUT HONESTLY,

17:32.718 --> 17:34.845
IT REALLY KEPT YOU
FROM PUTTING YOUR ALL INTO IT.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.013
- NO, IT DIDN'T.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.973
- I MEAN, IF THAT'S
HOW YOU TATTOO EVERY DAY...

17:38.057 --> 17:39.433
- BECAUSE WHEN I SAT DOWN...

17:39.516 --> 17:40.976
- THEN NOW I SEE CLEARLY
WHY YOU'RE IN THE SITUATION

17:41.059 --> 17:43.145
YOU ARE WITH THE JUDGES
AND EVERYTHING.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.064
- THIS IS CHARMING.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
HAVE FUN
TALKING [bleep] ABOUT ME.

17:48.192 --> 17:48.734
- WHY DIDN'T YOU GUYS
TALK THIS OUT

17:48.817 --> 17:50.861
AND WORK AS A TEAM, MAN?

17:50.944 --> 17:51.945
- SHE DISAPPEARED FOR TWO HOURS,
AND SHE CAME BACK,

17:52.029 --> 17:53.447
AND THEN
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO TATTOO.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.491
I HAD SPENT THE WHOLE TWO HOURS
FIXING HER BULL[bleep] SHADING,

17:55.574 --> 17:57.409
FIXING YOUR LINES--
THAT [bleep] WAS GNARLY, DUDE.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.994
IT SHOWED
WHY YOU'RE IN THE BOTTOM.

17:59.077 --> 18:00.996
YOU CAN'T DENY IT BECAUSE
I [bleep] SAW THOSE TATTOOS.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.122
- YOU'RE TALKING TO ME?
- I'M TALKING TO YOU.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.666
I'M TALKING TO EMILY TOO
IF SHE WAS HERE, IT SHOWS.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.085
- WHO THE [bleep] MADE YOU THE
HEAD MOTHER[bleep] IN CHARGE?

18:06.168 --> 18:08.545
- I PRETTY MUCH HAD TO DO
THE WHOLE TATTOO AGAIN.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.880
- OH, "I CLEANED IT UP.

18:09.963 --> 18:10.839
I DID THE TAT.
I FIXED IT."

18:10.923 --> 18:13.842
I KNEW HE WAS GONNA
DO THIS [bleep].

18:13.926 --> 18:14.843
- I SHOULD BE ALLOWED
TO BE PISSED, DUDE.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.637
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO PULL CLEAN LINES,

18:16.720 --> 18:18.347
AND THEN SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO PULL CLEAN BLACK.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.348
- I'LL PUT IT LIKE THIS.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.225
I DID MY PART.
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.643
I'LL SAY [bleep] YOU,
[bleep] YOU, AND [bleep] YOU.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.603
GOOD NIGHT.

18:24.686 --> 18:28.398
- THAT WAS A GOOD EXIT.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.703
- TODAY, YOUR FUNDAMENTALS

18:41.787 --> 18:45.249
WERE PUT TO THE TEST TATTOOING
AMERICAN TRADITIONAL AS A TEAM.

18:45.332 --> 18:48.877
- OBVIOUSLY AMERICAN TRADITIONAL
IS MY FAVORITE STYLE.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.712
IT'S WHAT I LOVE,
AND SO FAR,

18:50.796 --> 18:52.214
EVERY SEASON WE'VE DONE
AMERICAN TRADITIONAL,

18:52.297 --> 18:53.674
IT'S JUST BEEN A BLOODBATH

18:53.757 --> 18:55.926
BECAUSE PEOPLE
THINK THAT IT'S SIMPLE.

18:56.009 --> 19:00.848
THESE FOUR TATTOOS
ARE ALL VERY NICE TATTOOS.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.892
THERE'S NO STINKERS,
SO OVERALL, MAN, I'M STOKED.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.020
- JOSH, EMILY, AND ANGEL,

19:07.104 --> 19:08.730
LET'S START WITH YOU.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.692
- THIS IS THE BEST TATTOO

19:11.775 --> 19:12.818
THAT WE'VE SEEN
OUT OF EMILY OR ANGEL

19:12.901 --> 19:15.279
THIS ENTIRE COMPETITION.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.073
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH
STRUGGLING TO GET A PRETTY FACE

19:18.156 --> 19:19.533
ON SOMEBODY'S SKIN,

19:19.616 --> 19:22.452
AND WE FINALLY DID A REALLY
NICE, BEAUTIFUL GIRL'S FACE.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.705
- THE FUNDAMENTALS IN
THIS TATTOO WERE DEFINITELY HIT.

19:24.788 --> 19:25.873
IT'S VERY SMOOTH.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.749
THE LINE WORK ON IT
IS FLAWLESS,

19:27.833 --> 19:29.293
AND OVERALL,
I THINK IT'S A GREAT JOB.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.129
all: THANK YOU.

19:32.212 --> 19:37.092
- CLEEN, ERIK, AND TY'ESHA.

19:37.175 --> 19:38.260
- IT'S A TOUGH-LOOKING DESIGN.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.428
IT STANDS OUT,

19:39.511 --> 19:40.888
DEFINITELY HITS THE MARK
FOR AMERICAN TRADITIONAL.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.223
IT'S JUST A GOOD, BOLD TATTOO.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.809
- FUNDAMENTAL TATTOOING,
REALLY CLEAN OUTLINE,

19:45.893 --> 19:47.519
REALLY SOLID, REALLY BOLD.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.438
THE DOWNFALL TO THIS TATTOO,

19:49.521 --> 19:54.318
THE TAIL FEATHERS ARE AS BIG,
IF NOT BIGGER, THAN THE WINGS.

19:54.401 --> 19:57.946
THAT REALLY THROWS OFF
THE SHAPE.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.909
- AARON, DON, AND CRIS.

20:01.992 --> 20:02.910
- WELL, GETTING
TO YOUR FUNDAMENTALS,

20:02.993 --> 20:05.037
I WISH THIS LINE WORK
WAS TWICE AS THICK.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.663
WE HAVE ALL THIS EMPTY ROOM.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.333
A HUGE LINE ON THIS THING WOULD
HAVE MADE IT LOOK STRONGER.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.627
- FOR BOLD,
HEAVY AMERICAN TRADITIONAL,

20:11.710 --> 20:13.003
IT LOOKS VERY DAINTY.

20:13.086 --> 20:16.965
LOOKING AT THE WATERLINE DOWN,
THE TATTOO LOOKS COMPLETE,

20:17.049 --> 20:18.634
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK,

20:18.717 --> 20:20.427
AND NOW JUST LOOK AT THE TOP
OF THIS BOTTLE.

20:20.510 --> 20:21.845
THAT LOOKS
STRAIGHT KINDERGARTEN,

20:21.929 --> 20:25.015
AND THAT REALLY STICKS OUT
LIKE A SORE THUMB.

20:25.098 --> 20:28.810
- MARK, JASON, AND JULIA.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.354
JASON, HOW'D THIS GO FOR YOU?

20:30.437 --> 20:32.814
- WE ALL DECIDED
THAT I SHOULD DO THE LINE WORK,

20:32.898 --> 20:33.899
AND THEN MARK
WOULD TACKLE THE SHADING,

20:33.982 --> 20:36.234
AND THEN JULIA WOULD COME IN
AND DO THE COLOR WORK.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.319
- FIRST GLANCE, A NICE TATTOO.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.489
THE SHADING IN THE SAILS--
PRETTY MUCH PERFECT,

20:40.572 --> 20:41.031
THE COLOR IS NICE,

20:41.114 --> 20:42.783
BUT THE LETTERING,

20:42.866 --> 20:45.369
THAT'S THE BIG WEAK SPOT
OF THIS TATTOO.

20:45.452 --> 20:46.828
YOUR "S" HAS A COUPLE WONKS
IN IT.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.830
YOUR "O" IS NOT PERFECTLY ROUND.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.374
THAT'S DROPPING THE BALL.

20:50.457 --> 20:53.335
- THE THING THAT STRIKES ME
THE MOST IS IN THE MASTS,

20:53.418 --> 20:56.546
THE STRAIGHT LINE GOING
UP AND DOWN, IT JUST CURVES.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.924
THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THAT.

21:00.884 --> 21:01.843
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

21:01.927 --> 21:06.139
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.727
- I MEAN, MOST OF THE FLAWS
THEY POINTED OUT

21:10.811 --> 21:13.689
WERE IN THE LINE WORK, WHICH WAS
JASON'S RESPONSIBILITY.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.942
- I THOUGHT THE PART OF
THE TATTOO THAT I DID WAS NICE.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.986
- MARK IS DELUSIONAL.

21:19.069 --> 21:22.364
{\an8}HE IS JUST NOT AS GOOD A TATTOO
ARTIST AS HE THINKS HE IS.

21:22.447 --> 21:22.990
{\an8}YOU KNOW, YOU DID THE SHADING.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.866
{\an8}WE WERE GIVING YOU ADVICE

21:24.950 --> 21:26.493
{\an8}TO JUST BRING IT
CLOSER TO THE LINE,

21:26.576 --> 21:31.123
{\an8}AND I FELT LIKE MAYBE YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.542
{\an8}- THE FACT THAT JULIA'S
OUTLASTED VETERAN TATTOOERS

21:33.625 --> 21:34.710
{\an8}BLOWS MY MIND.

21:34.793 --> 21:35.752
{\an8}[imitates explosion]

21:35.836 --> 21:37.546
{\an8}SHE NEEDS TO SHUT
HER [bleep] MOUTH.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.631
- IT SEEMED LIKE YOU JUST
COULDN'T GET IT IN THERE.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.632
- HE HAS THE LINER.

21:40.716 --> 21:41.466
HE'S GONNA GO IN
AND GET THE PARTS

21:41.550 --> 21:42.592
THAT I CAN'T GET
WITH THE SHADER.

21:42.676 --> 21:43.885
- AND YOU COULD HAVE GONE IN
YOURSELF AND DONE IT.

21:43.969 --> 21:44.928
- IT'S NOT A MISTAKE.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.763
- THAT'S BULL[bleep].

21:46.847 --> 21:48.181
HIS SHADING WAS WEAK.

21:48.265 --> 21:48.974
IF I'M IN THE BOTTOM TODAY,

21:49.057 --> 21:52.352
IT'S GOING TO BE 100% HIS FAULT,

21:52.436 --> 21:56.231
AND I'M GOING TO BE SO PISSED.

21:56.314 --> 21:58.984
- TODAY WE'RE TESTING
THE FUNDAMENTALS

21:59.067 --> 22:01.403
OF TATTOOING WITH
AMERICAN TRADITIONAL TATTOOS.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.030
- OVERALL,
WE'RE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.990
THREE MINDS ARE BETTER THAN ONE.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.701
LUCKILY, THE WAY THE TEAMS
PAIRED UP ON THE RANDOM DRAW

22:07.784 --> 22:09.077
WORKED TO EVERYBODY'S ADVANTAGE.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.620
- LET'S MOVE INTO SPECIFICS.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.247
CLEEN, ERIK, AND TY'ESHA.

22:12.330 --> 22:13.415
- GOOD, BOLD OUTLINE.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.959
NICE, SOLID, BLACK SHADING.
VERY RECOGNIZABLE.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.711
STANDS OUT,
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS THING,

22:17.794 --> 22:19.337
THERE'S NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT,
THE WINGS ARE TOO SMALL.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.591
THESE WINGS ARE JUST AS WIDE
AS THE BODY IS.

22:22.674 --> 22:23.800
- YEAH.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.302
NEXT UP IS JASON, JULIA,
AND MARK.

22:25.385 --> 22:28.013
- LOOKING AT THE TATTOO
AT FIRST GLANCE,

22:28.096 --> 22:29.097
IT'S PLEASANT TO LOOK AT,

22:29.181 --> 22:31.850
BUT WHEN WE GET INTO IT,
IT DOES HAVE ITS HICCUPS.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.226
- THIS LETTERING,
IT'S JUST FLAWED.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.270
- WE KNOW JASON'S BODY OF WORK,

22:35.353 --> 22:36.354
AND JASON DOES NOT HAVE
A STRONG OUTLINE.

22:36.438 --> 22:40.609
A LOT OF THE FLAWS
IN THIS TATTOO ARE ON JASON.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.361
- NEXT UP WE HAD
AARON, CRIS, AND DON.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.154
- IF YOU'RE GONNA
DO A DESIGN THIS SIMPLE,

22:44.237 --> 22:46.615
YOU'VE GOT
TO GET IN AND GET BOLD

22:46.698 --> 22:47.824
AND PUT SOME HEAVY LINE

22:47.908 --> 22:48.992
AND HEAVY SHADING ON IT
TO BUILD IT UP.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.078
IT'S A GOOD IMAGE.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.205
IT JUST NEEDS
TO BE A LOT STRONGER.

22:53.288 --> 22:54.664
- JOSH, EMILY, AND ANGEL.

22:54.748 --> 22:57.042
- GOT A LOT
OF SOLID BLACK, SMOOTH COLOR.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.001
THIS TATTOO
IS FINISHED OUT NICE.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.628
IT'S GOT A NICE OUTLINE ON IT.

22:59.711 --> 23:04.424
VERY RELIEVED TO SEE ALL GOOD
TATTOOS ON TRADITIONAL DAY.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.635
- CLEARLY THESE ARE TEAMS
OF THREE,

23:06.718 --> 23:07.636
AND WE'RE PICKING A BOTTOM HERE.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.304
HOW ARE WE GONNA CHOOSE
WHO TO SEND HOME?

23:09.387 --> 23:12.140
- THERE'S NO CLEAR BOTTOM
OUT OF THESE THINGS.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.435
- WHY DON'T YOU GRAB THEM,
AND WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE?

23:19.064 --> 23:21.858
- I FEEL SO ILL RIGHT NOW.

23:21.942 --> 23:25.112
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO HOME
IF YOU'RE NOT UP TO IT.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.405
- DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHERE THE [bleep] I SHOULD GO.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.950
- DID YOU HAVE TO TOUCH UP
HER STUFF?

23:30.033 --> 23:31.159
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

23:31.243 --> 23:35.330
- REALLY, 'CAUSE YOU SPENT
AN HOUR AND A HALF ON THE LINES?

23:35.413 --> 23:37.082
REALLY, JOSH?

23:37.165 --> 23:39.334
- OH.

23:39.417 --> 23:41.711
- HERE WE GO.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.342
- ALL RIGHT, WE WANT TO SEE
EVERYBODY BACK DOWNSTAIRS.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.344
- OH.

23:49.427 --> 23:51.179
- OH, GOD.
I HATE WHEN HE DOES THAT.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.514
- THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.558
- NO BULL[bleep].

24:00.313 --> 24:01.857
- TODAY YOU HAD TO WORK
AS A TEAM

24:01.940 --> 24:04.651
TO CREATE
AN AMERICAN TRADITIONAL TATTOO.

24:04.734 --> 24:07.279
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED...

24:07.362 --> 24:12.033
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY...

24:12.117 --> 24:16.621
GOES TO JOSH, ANGEL, AND EMILY.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.540
CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.250
- THANK YOU.

24:20.333 --> 24:24.254
- THE THREE OF YOU
ARE SAFE FROM ELIMINATION.

24:24.337 --> 24:28.550
HOWEVER, THE REST OF YOU
ARE NOT.

24:31.595 --> 24:34.514
ALL OF YOU HAVE
AN IMPORTANT DECISION TO MAKE.

24:34.598 --> 24:37.392
EACH OF YOU AS A TEAM
MUST DISCUSS AND DECIDE

24:37.475 --> 24:42.564
WHICH ARTIST ON YOUR TEAM
WAS THE WEAKEST.

24:42.647 --> 24:46.735
THE ARTIST EACH TEAM NOMINATES
WILL BE PUT UP FOR ELIMINATION.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.028
- IT'S GONNA BE A MAJORITY VOTE,
TWO AGAINST ONE,

24:48.111 --> 24:51.907
ON WHO TO SEND DOWN.

24:51.990 --> 24:52.949
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

24:53.033 --> 24:56.995
THIS TIME,
THE DECISION IS YOURS.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.707
{\an8}- YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME
BECAUSE YOU SUCK AS TATTOOERS.

25:00.790 --> 25:03.335
{\an8}- YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
- THIS IS SOME BULL[bleep].

25:03.418 --> 25:06.338
{\an8}- YOU'RE SUCH A BITCH.
- IT WAS A COP-OUT.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.346
- DO YOU AGREE IN THIS GROUP
THAT ME AND ERIK

25:14.429 --> 25:15.597
ARE THE STRONGER?

25:15.680 --> 25:16.932
- I REALLY CAN'T SAY
ANYBODY'S STRONGER.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.226
- I HAVE A FEELING THAT
IF EITHER ME OR HIM GO DOWN,

25:19.309 --> 25:21.144
THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE,
WE'RE COVERING FOR SOMEBODY.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.438
- THAT'S WHAT I THINK TOO.

25:23.521 --> 25:24.564
IF I WENT DOWN, THEY'RE
GONNA BE LIKE, "OKAY, UM"...

25:24.648 --> 25:25.857
- THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE,
"WHAT THE"--

25:25.941 --> 25:29.069
- "YOU'RE PUTTING CLEEN
DOWN FOR"--

25:29.152 --> 25:31.279
- I DO NOT WANT
TO BE IN THE BOTTOM AGAIN, MAN.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.614
I'M NOT GONNA WIN THE FIGHT
UP AGAINST ERIK AND CLEEN.

25:32.697 --> 25:35.283
THE GUYS ARE GONNA GANG UP
AGAINST THE GIRL.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.118
THIS IS SOME BULL[bleep].

25:37.202 --> 25:38.787
- CRIS DID ALL THE BLACKS.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.497
YOU DID SOME OF THE COLOR.
I DID SOME OF THE COLOR.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.665
I DID THE LINE WORK.

25:41.748 --> 25:42.666
ME AND CRIS
BOTH WENT BACK INTO THE RED.

25:42.749 --> 25:46.127
- I THOUGHT MY COLOR
WAS PRETTY SATURATED.

25:46.211 --> 25:50.298
- BUT THAT'S THE THING.
YOUR COLOR CHOICE WE HAD TO FIX.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.925
- I MEAN,
WHAT IF WE GO

25:52.008 --> 25:53.635
BY WHAT THE JUDGES HAD
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH?

25:53.718 --> 25:55.136
THEY HAMMERED THE LINE WEIGHT.
- WELL, THE TWO OF US--

25:55.220 --> 25:56.471
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THICKER,
BUT THE LINES WERE STRAIGHT,

25:56.554 --> 25:58.390
AND IF IT COMES DOWN
TO WHO DID THE MOST

25:58.473 --> 26:01.810
THAT HAD TO BE GONE INTO,
THAT'S YOU.

26:01.893 --> 26:02.602
DON'S A CLEAR CHOICE.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.437
HIS DRAWING SKILLS ARE LACKING.

26:04.521 --> 26:05.605
{\an8}HIS MECHANICAL SKILLS
ARE LACKING.

26:05.689 --> 26:08.984
HE'S THE OBVIOUS CHOICE
OUT OF THE THREE OF US.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.819
- WE'RE AT SUCH A STANDSTILL
WITH OUR PIECE.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.654
I MEAN, I FELT LIKE I DID
ALL OF THE LINE WORK,

26:12.737 --> 26:16.157
WHICH I FELT ON THAT SHIP
WAS A HARD-ASS THING TO TACKLE.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.785
- WELL, PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE,
WHO DO YOU FEEL

26:18.868 --> 26:20.412
IS THE WEAKER LINK
OUT OF YOUR GROUP?

26:20.495 --> 26:23.415
- I WAS GIVING TIPS, AND MARK
WAS GIVING TIPS TO JULIA,

26:23.498 --> 26:25.166
AND HER TRACK RECORD,
SHE'S BEEN DOWN THERE.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.001
- I WAS DOWN THERE ONCE.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.585
MARK'S BEEN DOWN THERE
EVERY TIME.

26:27.669 --> 26:28.753
- THAT IS TRUE, MARK.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.005
YOU HAVE BEEN DOWN THERE
QUITE A BIT MORE.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.007
- I JUST THINK
THAT BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,

26:32.090 --> 26:34.092
WE WERE BOTH CORRECTING YOU...
- WE CORRECTED YOU TOO, THOUGH.

26:34.175 --> 26:35.760
ME AND HIM FIXED YOUR MISTAKES.
- AND HELPING YOU OUT.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.178
THIS IS NOTHING PERSONAL.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.180
YOU WERE THE ONE WE HAD TO HOLD
YOUR HAND THROUGH IT THE MOST.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.308
- I HAD HIM FIX YOUR COLOR WORK
AT THE END.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.435
- I WAS [bleep] WITH THAT ON MY
HOUR BECAUSE I RAN OUT OF TIME.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.103
- YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE IT RIGHT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

26:45.186 --> 26:48.064
- SO WHO'S GOING DOWN?

26:48.148 --> 26:49.524
- I CAN IMAGINE
JULIA'S GONNA SAY ME.

26:49.607 --> 26:50.859
I'M GONNA SAY JULIA,

26:50.942 --> 26:55.864
SO IT'S PROBABLY JUST GONNA HAVE
TO BE YOUR DECISION.

26:55.947 --> 26:59.242
- YOU GUYS ARE NOT GONNA
GO HOME BASED OFF MY DECISION.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.202
YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME
BECAUSE YOU SUCK AS TATTOOERS.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.204
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.457
I'M GONNA GO DOWN.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.543
I'M GONNA STAND ON THE SWORD
FOR IT AND DO IT

27:08.626 --> 27:11.212
'CAUSE I'M AN HONORABLE MAN,
AND THAT'S WHAT I [bleep] DO.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.547
{\an8}- THAT'S JUST PLAIN LUDICROUS.

27:12.630 --> 27:13.965
JASON'S STUPID FOR SURE.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.300
SEND THE WEAK LINK.

27:15.383 --> 27:18.386
YOU DO NOT WANT
TO BE IN THE BOTTOM EVER.

27:18.470 --> 27:19.637
JASON.

27:19.721 --> 27:20.847
- YEAH?
- DUDE, REALLY?

27:20.930 --> 27:23.308
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING?

27:23.391 --> 27:25.226
- LISTEN, GUYS,
I CAN'T BE THE JUDGE

27:25.310 --> 27:27.562
ON THIS COMPETITION FOR THEM
TO GO HOME, MAN.

27:27.645 --> 27:28.730
IF THEY'RE GONNA GET SENT HOME,

27:28.813 --> 27:30.315
IT'S GONNA BE
ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT.

27:30.398 --> 27:32.317
- DID ANY OF THEM SAY,

27:32.400 --> 27:33.485
"JASON, YOU NEED TO GO
DOWN THERE FOR US"?

27:33.568 --> 27:34.819
- NO, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE

27:34.903 --> 27:37.030
THE ONE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
THAT GOES,

27:37.113 --> 27:39.991
"I'M THE DUDE WHO SENT MARK HOME
BECAUSE I SENT HIM DOWN THERE."

27:40.075 --> 27:41.242
I WANT TO AT LEAST WALK AWAY

27:41.326 --> 27:42.285
AND LOOK AT MYSELF
IN THE [bleep] MIRROR FOR ONCE.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.204
- THAT'S ADMIRABLE
AND EVERYTHING, BUT COME ON.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.915
- DO YOU FEEL THAT, LIKE--

27:46.998 --> 27:50.168
I'M NOT, LIKE, SITTING HERE
TRYING TO [bleep] SAVE YOU.

27:50.251 --> 27:52.754
- I WANT PEOPLE TO LOSE
ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.255
- DUDE, YOU'RE NUTS.
- NUTS.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.298
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

27:55.382 --> 27:58.093
{\an8}- DO I WANT TO GO DOWN?

27:58.176 --> 28:00.678
{\an8}HELL NO,
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

28:00.762 --> 28:02.597
I'M TRYING
TO DO THE HONORABLE THING HERE.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.599
I CAN'T BEAR TO GIVE
SOMEBODY ELSE THE DEATH WARRANT.

28:04.682 --> 28:08.061
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO IN THIS SITUATION.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.613
- TODAY,
THERE WERE NO CLEAR LOSERS.

28:18.696 --> 28:22.409
NOW IT'S UP TO YOU TO DECIDE
WHICH ARTIST

28:22.492 --> 28:24.702
ON YOUR TEAM WAS THE WEAKEST.

28:24.786 --> 28:28.957
CLEEN, TY'ESHA, AND ERIK,
WE'LL START WITH YOU.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.708
CLEEN, WHAT'S YOUR DECISION?

28:30.792 --> 28:32.794
- I VOTE TY'ESHA.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.087
- TY'ESHA, WHAT'S YOUR VOTE?

28:34.170 --> 28:36.047
- I VOTE ERIK.

28:36.131 --> 28:39.134
- ERIK, WHAT'S YOUR VOTE?
- TY'ESHA.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.969
- THE MAJORITY RULES,
AND, TY'ESHA,

28:41.052 --> 28:43.763
YOU HAVE BEEN PUT UP
FOR ELIMINATION BY YOUR TEAM.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.306
- IT IS WHAT IT IS.
I'M NOT WORRIED.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.476
- AARON, DON, AND CRIS,

28:48.560 --> 28:50.353
IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR TEAM'S DECISION.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.855
AARON, WHAT IS YOUR VOTE?

28:51.938 --> 28:53.565
- RELUCTANTLY, IT'S DON.

28:53.648 --> 28:55.900
- CRIS, WHAT IS YOUR VOTE?
- DON.

28:55.984 --> 28:56.609
- DON, WHAT IS YOUR VOTE?

28:56.693 --> 29:00.905
- MYSELF.
- IT'S UNANIMOUS.

29:00.989 --> 29:05.535
DON, YOUR TEAM HAS VOTED
TO PUT YOU UP FOR ELIMINATION.

29:05.618 --> 29:08.079
MARK, JASON, AND JULIA,

29:08.163 --> 29:09.289
IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR TEAM'S DECISION.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.499
AND, JULIA, WHO DID YOU VOTE
TO PUT UP FOR ELIMINATION?

29:11.583 --> 29:14.627
- MARK--
HE HAD THE MOST STUFF

29:14.711 --> 29:17.255
THAT ME AND JASON
HAD TO GO IN AND FIX.

29:17.338 --> 29:19.215
- MARK, WHO DID YOU VOTE
TO PUT UP FOR ELIMINATION?

29:19.299 --> 29:22.385
- I VOTED JULIA.

29:22.469 --> 29:25.346
WE GAVE HER THE LEAST AMOUNT OF
WORK AND HAD TO FIX A LOT OF IT.

29:25.430 --> 29:29.017
- YOU WENT INTO MY STUFF
WHEN IT WASN'T EVEN MY TURN YET.

29:29.100 --> 29:33.771
ME AND JASON BOTH HAD TO GO
INTO YOUR STUFF AND FIX IT.

29:33.855 --> 29:37.567
- JASON, WHO DID YOU VOTE
TO PUT UP FOR ELIMINATION?

29:40.361 --> 29:42.155
- JULIA.

29:42.238 --> 29:44.574
- JULIA, YOU'VE BEEN
VOTED UP FOR ELIMINATION.

29:44.657 --> 29:45.283
- I'M READY,

29:45.366 --> 29:47.660
AND I'M GONNA BRING IT.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.246
- TY'ESHA, DON, AND JULIA,

29:50.330 --> 29:53.166
YOUR TEAMMATES
HAVE PUT YOU UP FOR ELIMINATION,

29:53.249 --> 29:57.045
BUT ONLY ONE OF YOU
WILL BE PACKING YOUR MACHINES.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.588
THE THREE OF YOU MUST FACE OFF

29:58.671 --> 30:00.715
TATTOOING HEAD-TO-HEAD
TO DETERMINE

30:00.798 --> 30:03.843
WHO WILL CONTINUE
IN THE COMPETITION

30:03.927 --> 30:06.054
AND WHO WILL BE
PACKING THEIR MACHINES.

30:06.137 --> 30:10.225
YOU HAVE ONE FINAL SHOT TO PROVE
YOU HAVE THE FUNDAMENTALS.

30:10.308 --> 30:14.229
EACH OF YOU MUST TATTOO THE SAME
AMERICAN TRADITIONAL DESIGN

30:14.312 --> 30:16.773
CREATED BY OLIVER PECK.

30:16.856 --> 30:18.107
- THE DESIGN IS DONE.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.068
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO: PUT IT
ON THE SKIN NICE AND CLEAN.

30:20.151 --> 30:23.821
- YOU'VE EACH BEEN RANDOMLY
ASSIGNED A HUMAN CANVAS.

30:23.905 --> 30:26.574
YOU'LL HAVE FOUR HOURS
TO COMPLETE YOUR TATTOO.

30:26.658 --> 30:30.995
IN THE END, ONE OF YOU WILL LOSE
YOUR SHOT AT $100,000

30:31.079 --> 30:32.664
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

30:32.747 --> 30:35.833
GRAB YOUR MACHINES.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.511
- I'M NOT SCARED.

30:46.594 --> 30:48.930
I DON'T BACK DOWN
FROM CHALLENGES.

30:49.013 --> 30:49.847
{\an8}I JUST LET MY WORK
SPEAK FOR ITSELF.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.433
{\an8}- I'M PISSED
THAT I'M AT THE BOTTOM,

30:52.517 --> 30:54.644
{\an8}BUT I'M NOT GONNA BITCH
AND MOAN AND CRY.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.396
{\an8}NO, I'M JUST GONNA DEAL
WITH WHAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH

30:56.479 --> 30:57.981
{\an8}TO GET THE TATTOO DONE
AND GET IT LOOKING GOOD.

30:58.064 --> 31:02.694
{\an8}- I KNOW I HAVE TO FIGHT FOR
MY POSITION IN THIS COMPETITION.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.946
BRING IT ON.
I'M READY.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.367
- THIS IS THE FACE-OFF.

31:09.450 --> 31:11.953
DON, JULIA, TY'ESHA,

31:12.036 --> 31:14.247
YOU WILL HAVE FOUR HOURS
TO COMPLETE

31:14.330 --> 31:18.001
AN AMERICAN TRADITIONAL TATTOO
DESIGNED BY OLIVER.

31:18.084 --> 31:20.378
- I JUST WANT TO SEE
A GOOD, CLEAN, SOLID TATTOO.

31:20.461 --> 31:21.504
REMEMBER TO THINK
ABOUT PLACEMENT ON THE BODY.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.798
ALTHOUGH IT'S A SIMPLE DESIGN,

31:23.881 --> 31:25.967
THERE'S STILL RIGHT WAYS
AND WRONG WAYS TO DO THINGS.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.511
- FOUR HOURS IS PLENTY OF TIME
TO DO THIS TATTOO,

31:28.595 --> 31:31.389
AND AMERICAN TRADITIONAL IS
WHAT I DO.

31:32.473 --> 31:36.227
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
YOU HAVE FOUR HOURS TO FACE OFF.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.147
TWO OF YOU ARE STAYING,
AND ONE OF YOU IS GOING HOME,

31:39.230 --> 31:41.149
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

31:41.232 --> 31:44.319
{\an1}- WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GET THIS?
- I WAS KIND OF THINKING SHIN.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.529
- LIKE, MAYBE, LIKE, THE BACK
OF YOUR CALF OR SOMETHING?

31:46.613 --> 31:47.739
I'M THINKING
IT'D LOOK PRETTY RAD THERE.

31:47.822 --> 31:48.948
- YEAH, I'D DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

31:49.032 --> 31:49.866
- AWESOME.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.284
- FOR THIS FACE-OFF, I CAME UP

31:51.367 --> 31:53.161
WITH A SKULL, CROSSBONES,
AND A DAGGER GOING THROUGH IT.

31:53.244 --> 31:58.124
{\an8}WHEN IT'S ALL THE SAME IMAGE,
MISTAKES REALLY STAND OUT.

31:58.207 --> 32:01.502
THEY HAVE TO FIGHT REALLY HARD
AND EITHER WIN OR GO HOME.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.838
- IT WILL LOOK GOOD,
LIKE, RIGHT THERE.

32:03.921 --> 32:06.758
- SO DO YOU GUYS THINK
THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR TATTOO

32:06.841 --> 32:09.677
THERE IS A RIGHT AND A WRONG WAY
TO HAVE IT FACING?

32:09.761 --> 32:13.848
- WELL, OF COURSE.
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

32:13.931 --> 32:15.266
- YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

32:15.350 --> 32:16.643
OH, MAN.

32:16.726 --> 32:17.685
LOOK AT THE SKULL.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.937
- YEAH, HIS IS FACING IN.

32:20.021 --> 32:21.522
AND THAT ONE,
HERS IS FACING OUT.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.942
THAT'S EXPERIENCE, BRO.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.527
SHE PUT THE TATTOO ON BACKWARDS,

32:26.611 --> 32:29.781
AND THEY'RE TESTING FUNDAMENTALS
OF TATTOOING.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.283
SHE ALREADY LOST IN MY EYES.

32:49.509 --> 32:50.968
- TATTOOS SHOULD
ALWAYS FACE FORWARD

32:51.052 --> 32:52.679
AND IN IF THEY HAVE EYES.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.222
THAT'S JUST THE RULE OF THUMB.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.223
IF YOU DO 'EM
THE OTHER WAY AROUND,

32:55.306 --> 32:57.225
THEY'RE REALLY
NOT FLATTERING ON THE BODY.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.560
- TWO OUT OF THREE
HAVE IT FACING THE RIGHT WAY.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.729
- YEAH, TY'ESHA.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.564
- LOOKING AT TODAY'S CHALLENGE
BEING FUNDAMENTALS,

33:03.648 --> 33:06.359
THESE ELEMENTARY MISTAKES
ARE HUGE.

33:06.442 --> 33:09.737
- THREE HOURS LEFT,
THREE MORE HOURS.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.828
- EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING
SOME STRESSED OUT [bleep].

33:19.580 --> 33:21.249
{\an8}- I KNOW THAT I HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES TO WIN THIS FACE-OFF.

33:21.332 --> 33:25.211
JULIA AND TY'ESHA ARE
THE TWO WEAKEST TATTOOERS HERE.

33:25.294 --> 33:26.671
THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM.

33:29.674 --> 33:30.800
- DON'S MY RIVAL FOR A REASON.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.093
{\an8}HE'S OVERCONFIDENT.
HE'S COCKY.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.887
I THINK THIS TATTOO
HAS TONS OF SHORTCOMINGS.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.097
I JUST CAN'T WAIT
UNTIL HE GOES HOME.

33:36.180 --> 33:39.350
IT'S LIKE LEADING LAMBS
TO THE SLAUGHTER.

33:39.434 --> 33:42.854
- YOU HAVE TWO HOURS REMAINING.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.608
- HIT THEM LINES WITH CONVICTION
LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.528
LIKE, JUST GO LIKE THIS.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.488
POINT A TO POINT B,
LIKE, MAKE IT HAPPEN.

33:52.572 --> 33:55.450
{\an8}- HAVING THE OTHER ARTISTS
WATCH ME OVER MY BACK

33:55.533 --> 33:58.035
{\an8}IS JUST FUELING ME
TO SHUT THEM THE HELL UP.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.913
- THESE TATTOOS ARE LITERALLY
TWO TO THREE COLORS, TOPS,

34:00.997 --> 34:03.291
AND IN THE SKULL ITSELF,
I WOULDN'T PUT ANYTHING.

34:03.374 --> 34:04.292
- ENOUGH OF IT ALREADY.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.210
I KNOW I'M GOING TO WIN.

34:06.294 --> 34:09.672
- AND FINAL HOUR.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.928
{\an8}- I'M NOT USED TO DOING
TRADITIONAL SKULLS.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.306
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH SHADING
OR WHAT COLOR GOES INTO THEM...

34:18.389 --> 34:20.308
YO, CLEEN,

34:20.391 --> 34:21.641
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

34:21.726 --> 34:25.730
- I'D SAY
RED, YELLOW, BLUE, BLACK.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.356
- BUT I GOT TO BUCKLE UP
AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS TATTOO

34:27.440 --> 34:32.652
FITS THE STANDARDS OF
AN AMERICAN TRADITIONAL TATTOO.

34:32.737 --> 34:36.574
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN,

34:36.657 --> 34:38.493
SIX, FIVE,

34:38.576 --> 34:42.163
FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.623
MACHINES DOWN.
TIME'S UP.

34:43.706 --> 34:46.501
NO MORE TATTOOING.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.753
- YOU'RE DONE.

34:48.835 --> 34:50.630
- WANT TO GO OVER HERE
AND CHECK IT OUT IN THE MIRROR?

34:50.713 --> 34:53.007
- YEAH.
- IT'S DEFINITELY BADASS.

34:53.090 --> 34:54.425
- JULIA SHOULD REALLY BE WORRIED
ABOUT GOING HOME.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.595
{\an8}SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF TATTOOING.

34:57.678 --> 34:58.888
SHE SHADED THE TEETH BLACK.

34:58.971 --> 35:01.432
IT'S TIME FOR HER TO GO.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.727
- OUT OF THE THREE, I THINK YOU
SHOULD BE A LITTLE WORRIED, DON.

35:04.811 --> 35:05.812
- SERIOUSLY?
- YEAH.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.021
- BUT, I MEAN,
IT WASN'T BACKWARDS,

35:07.105 --> 35:07.730
AND IT DIDN'T HAVE
A HITLER MUSTACHE.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.649
- IT WASN'T BACKWARDS.

35:09.732 --> 35:10.817
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO FACE
HER VAG.

35:10.900 --> 35:11.901
- YEAH, IT'S BACKWARDS.
- WHATEVER.

35:11.984 --> 35:12.693
- AND THEN YOURS IS
SO MUCH FORWARD IT'S, LIKE,

35:12.777 --> 35:15.029
ALMOST ON THE SHIN.

35:15.112 --> 35:16.739
- I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION.
WHY DID YOU SHADE THE TEETH?

35:16.823 --> 35:19.033
- BECAUSE I'VE SEEN

35:19.116 --> 35:19.992
AND DONE TRADITIONAL TATTOOS
WHERE THE TEETH WERE SHADED.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.703
- WELL, THEN YOU'VE BEEN
DOING IT WRONG.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.539
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE
TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.290
YOU DID A [bleep] JOB YESTERDAY,

35:26.374 --> 35:27.542
AND YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
IN THE BOTTOM,

35:27.625 --> 35:28.584
BUT JOSH SAVED YOUR ASS.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.878
- I'M SORRY, DO YOU WANT
TO [bleep] TALK TO ME

35:30.962 --> 35:32.421
ABOUT WHAT THE HELL
I WENT THROUGH?

35:32.505 --> 35:33.714
DON'T YOU DARE TALK TO ME

35:33.798 --> 35:35.007
ABOUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME
AND WHAT'S NOT.

35:35.091 --> 35:36.509
YOU WEREN'T
IN THAT GODDAMN BATHROOM

35:36.592 --> 35:37.593
WATCHING ME DIE ON THE FLOOR.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.178
HOW DARE YOU?
- I SAW YOU COME BACK,

35:39.262 --> 35:41.347
AND RIGHT AFTERWARDS,
YOU WERE OKAY.

35:41.430 --> 35:43.516
- I JUST COMMENTED
ON YOUR [bleep] UP TATTOO,

35:43.599 --> 35:44.767
AND YOU'RE GONNA TURN AROUND

35:44.851 --> 35:47.019
AND TALK TO ME ABOUT
MY PERSONAL [bleep] ILLNESSES?

35:47.103 --> 35:50.106
- I JUST FEEL LIKE
IT WAS A COP-OUT ON YOUR PART.

35:50.189 --> 35:51.858
- A COP-OUT?

35:51.941 --> 35:53.025
YOU ARE SUCH A BITCH.

35:53.109 --> 35:58.447
I'M NOT [bleep]
DOING THIS [bleep].

36:12.336 --> 36:15.423
- JULIA, TY'ESHA, AND DON,

36:15.506 --> 36:19.218
YOU FACED OFF TATTOOING
AN AMERICAN TRADITIONAL DESIGN

36:19.302 --> 36:20.720
BY OLIVER PECK.

36:20.803 --> 36:21.679
TWO OF YOU WILL BE STAYING,

36:21.762 --> 36:25.975
AND ONE OF YOU WILL BE
PACKING YOUR MACHINES.

36:26.058 --> 36:29.687
TY'ESHA, LET'S START WITH YOU.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.608
- YOU DEFINITELY
HAVE THE STRONGEST LINE WORK

36:33.691 --> 36:35.276
OUT OF THESE TATTOOS TODAY,
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE

36:35.359 --> 36:37.445
OUT OF THE THREE PEOPLE
THAT HAVE IT FACING BACKWARDS.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.030
OBVIOUSLY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
FLIPPED,

36:39.113 --> 36:41.490
AND YOU WENT OVERBOARD
WITH THE SHADING IN THE SKULL,

36:41.574 --> 36:43.284
GIVING IT A HAIRDO
AND A MUSTACHE.

36:43.367 --> 36:44.744
- WHAT DID YOU LEARN
TO TATTOO FIRST?

36:44.827 --> 36:46.412
- SKULLS, BUTTERFLIES.

36:46.495 --> 36:47.747
- SKULLS?
- YES.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.708
- SO YOU DO UNDERSTAND THE
CONCEPT OF WHERE SHADING GOES?

36:50.791 --> 36:51.959
- ON THIS STYLE,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW IT GOES.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.961
IT WAS MORE LIKE A GUESS.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.171
- THIS IS A COMPETITION,

36:55.254 --> 36:57.465
AND YOU ARE EXPECTED
TO KNOW ALL OF THESE THINGS,

36:57.548 --> 36:59.467
SO THAT IS A MAJOR FLAW.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.844
- [inhales sharply]

37:01.928 --> 37:04.221
- DON.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.475
DO YOU FEEL
YOU'VE REDEEMED YOURSELF

37:07.558 --> 37:08.726
SINCE THE LAST CHALLENGE?

37:08.809 --> 37:11.312
- I MEAN, I DIDN'T THINK
I REALLY HAD REDEEMING

37:11.395 --> 37:13.522
TO DO FROM THAT, BUT I THINK
I DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB WITH IT.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.316
- WELL, DON, PRETTY MUCH
EVERYWHERE YOU PUT THE SHADING

37:15.399 --> 37:17.360
AND THE COLOR IN THIS TATTOO
IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE,

37:17.443 --> 37:20.071
BUT OVERALL, THE TATTOO'S
NOT REALLY THAT BRIGHT.

37:20.154 --> 37:21.614
YOUR YELLOW'S REALLY PALE.

37:21.697 --> 37:23.991
- YOUR OUTLINE ON THIS THING
IS WHAT'S TOUGH.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.577
IN THE HANDLE OF THE DAGGER
AND IN THE BLADE ITSELF,

37:26.661 --> 37:29.789
THOSE ARE THE AREAS WHERE
YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE PRECISE.

37:29.872 --> 37:31.332
WHERE YOU HAVE THE TWO LOOPS
ON THE DAGGER COMING OFF,

37:31.415 --> 37:34.710
YOU GOT A FLAT SPOT
ON THE BOTTOM LEFT SIDE,

37:34.794 --> 37:36.087
AND THEN YOUR OTHER SIDE
DOESN'T MATCH.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.672
IT GETS THICKER AND THINNER.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.257
IF YOU LOOK AT TY'ESHA'S OUTLINE
AND YOU LOOK AT YOUR OUTLINE,

37:40.341 --> 37:44.595
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.640
- JULIA.

37:47.723 --> 37:48.933
- YOUR OUTLINE'S PRETTY CLEAN.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.184
YOUR CONTRAST IS GOOD.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.227
YOUR YELLOW IS SOLID.

37:51.310 --> 37:52.728
YOUR SATURATION IS NICE.

37:52.812 --> 37:53.771
OUT OF ALL THREE SKULLS,

37:53.854 --> 37:55.439
THIS IS THE ONE
THAT I LIKE THE SHADING

37:55.523 --> 37:58.150
IN THE MOST,
EXCEPT FOR THOSE TEETH.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.611
MAKING THESE TEETH BLACK
IS AN ODD CHOICE.

38:00.695 --> 38:01.737
IF THOSE TEETH WEREN'T BLACK,

38:01.821 --> 38:03.531
THIS WOULD BE
THE ALL-AROUND FAVORITE ONE.

38:03.614 --> 38:04.448
- IT IS SMOOTH.
IT IS MINIMAL.

38:04.532 --> 38:07.326
THIS IS PROBABLY
THE STRONGEST THING--

38:07.410 --> 38:07.743
AS A JUDGE--I'VE SEEN YOU DO.

38:07.827 --> 38:12.873
- THANK YOU.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.959
- I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH THE WAY
ALL THESE TURNED OUT.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.711
THERE'S HIGHS AND LOWS
TO EACH ONE OF THESE TATTOOS.

38:16.794 --> 38:19.797
- DAYS LIKE THIS, NOBODY'S GOING
HOME FOR DOING A BAD TATTOO.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.257
IT'S JUST THE WAY
THE COOKIE CRUMBLES TODAY,

38:21.340 --> 38:25.344
AND THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE
IN THIS ROOM.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.471
- WE HAVE TO DECIDE
WHO WE'RE SENDING HOME HERE.

38:27.555 --> 38:30.808
{\an8}- EVEN THOUGH TY'ESHA HAS
THE STRONGEST OVERALL OUTLINE,

38:30.891 --> 38:32.893
{\an8}JULIA'S TATTOO,
EVEN WITH THE BLACK TEETH,

38:32.977 --> 38:35.021
{\an8}IS BETTER THAN THE MUSTACHE.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.732
ONE OF THE WAYS I LOOK AT IT IS,
"COULD I FIX THESE TATTOOS?"

38:37.815 --> 38:39.734
TY'ESHA'S IS SO BLACK EVERYWHERE

38:39.817 --> 38:40.943
EXCEPT FOR THIS AREA,

38:41.027 --> 38:42.862
IT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE
IT HAS BIG GOGGLES ON.

38:42.945 --> 38:45.531
I COULD GO IN AND SHADE
THE REST OF THAT SKULL,

38:45.614 --> 38:47.074
BUT IT'S STILL
GONNA BE BACKWARDS.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.410
DON'S DOESN'T REALLY
NEED A WHOLE LOT TO FIX IT.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.203
I WOULD PUT
A DIFFERENT YELLOW IN,

38:51.287 --> 38:52.997
PUMP UP THE OUTLINE,
AND CALL IT A DAY.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.583
THE QUESTION: IS TY'ESHA'S
LITTLE BIT BOLDER OUTLINE

38:55.666 --> 38:56.917
AND THAT SOLID YELLOW--

38:57.001 --> 38:59.503
IS THAT ENOUGH TO MAKE UP
FOR WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

38:59.587 --> 39:02.548
- LOOKING AT THESE TATTOOS
IN COMPARISON TO EACH OTHER,

39:02.631 --> 39:05.926
DON, YOU HAVE VERY FEW AREAS OF
PRECISION IN THE ENTIRE TATTOO.

39:06.010 --> 39:06.969
- I KNOW I'M BETTER THAN THAT.

39:07.053 --> 39:08.596
I MEAN, I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.306
I HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE
OF THESE TATTOOS.

39:10.389 --> 39:11.974
I EAT, LIVE,
BREATHE THIS [bleep].

39:12.058 --> 39:13.601
THIS IS NOT A JOB.
IT'S A [bleep] LIFESTYLE.

39:13.684 --> 39:17.480
THIS IS WHAT I DO.

39:17.563 --> 39:19.440
- OLIVER, FINAL DECISION.

39:19.523 --> 39:20.524
- TY'ESHA.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.109
- I'D RATHER WEAR DON'S.

39:22.193 --> 39:26.030
I VOTE FOR TY'ESHA.
- TY'ESHA.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.032
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:28.115 --> 39:32.286
TY'ESHA, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

39:32.369 --> 39:33.329
- [sniffles]

39:33.412 --> 39:36.290
- STANDING ON MY ETHICS
OF TATTOOING

39:36.373 --> 39:37.917
AND WHAT WAS DRILLED INTO ME,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.252
THAT BACKWARDS DESIGN
IS A KILLER.

39:40.336 --> 39:44.298
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

39:46.675 --> 39:47.968
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M ELIMINATED.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.845
I MADE A ROOKIE-ASS MISTAKE.

39:49.929 --> 39:52.139
I FEEL REALLY TERRIBLE
RIGHT NOW,

39:52.223 --> 39:54.517
BUT I FEEL LIKE I DID DO
AN AMAZING TATTOO.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.520
THEY DESERVED TO BE ELIMINATED,
NOT ME.

40:01.649 --> 40:04.568
announcer: STILL TO COME
THIS SEASON ON <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:04.652 --> 40:06.362
- I'M HERE TO BE THE INK MASTER.

40:06.445 --> 40:09.156
- SHOW US THAT YOU CAN DO
BETTER, OR IT'S LIGHTS OUT, BUD.

40:09.240 --> 40:09.990
- THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT COULD HAPPEN.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.992
- THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR ERROR AT ALL.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.661
- THE SMELL OF BLOOD
SMELLS LIKE MONEY TO ME.

40:13.744 --> 40:14.620
- YOU DON'T RESPECT
ANYBODY HERE, SO...

40:14.703 --> 40:17.581
- OH, STOP.
- WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU OUT.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.834
- OFF THE FIELD,
HE FIGHTS TIRELESSLY

40:19.917 --> 40:23.212
FOR BREAST CANCER AWARENESS,
RUNNING BACK DEANGELO WILLIAMS.

40:23.295 --> 40:24.171
- I'M HERE TO [bleep] COMPETE.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.382
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA START?

40:26.465 --> 40:28.801
- YOU'RE A [bleep] LIAR.
YOU'RE A [bleep] CHEAT.

40:28.884 --> 40:31.262
- YOU'RE A SELF-ABSORBED PRICK
OF AN ASS[bleep].

40:31.345 --> 40:32.096
- ARE YOU WILLING
TO COMPROMISE A LITTLE BIT?

40:32.179 --> 40:33.097
- HAVE A NICE LIFE.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.266
GO [bleep] YOURSELF.

40:35.349 --> 40:36.308
- DUDE, SHE'S GOING OUT?
- YEAH, SHE'S OUT.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.394
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH, I'M SORRY.

40:38.477 --> 40:39.979
I CAN'T CONTROL THAT TWITCHING.

40:40.062 --> 40:42.731
- IF YOU'RE GONNA CHEAT, PAY
THE [bleep] PIPER OR GO HOME.

40:42.815 --> 40:43.440
- QUIT SHAKING
YOUR [bleep] HEAD.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.401
- DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

40:45.484 --> 40:47.361
- I HELPED YOU BY NOT BEATING
YOUR [bleep] HEAD INTO THE WALL.

40:47.444 --> 40:49.321
YOU'RE A PUNK BITCH.
- YOU'RE DONE!

40:49.405 --> 40:52.700
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
TATTOO EVER AGAIN!

40:52.783 --> 40:55.119
- THIS TATTOO'S GONNA
BE THE DEATH OF ONE OF YOU.
