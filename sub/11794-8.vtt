00:03.969 --> 00:07.040
 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
 <i>morning and the alarm</i>
 <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:07.073 --> 00:09.943
 <i>* I don't think</i>

00:09.976 --> 00:12.879
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>

00:12.912 --> 00:16.282

01:15.208 --> 01:17.177
 It's Homecoming Week,

01:17.210 --> 01:20.146
   and Bayside is getting ready
   for the big game
   against Valley.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.382
 I don't like to
 knock our team,
  but last year

01:22.415 --> 01:26.820
their band scored
a touchdown against us.

01:26.853 --> 01:29.389
  Hey guys,
  you got anything here
  for your star quarterback?

01:29.422 --> 01:30.857
Life insurance.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.926
  We haven't beaten
  Valley in 22 years.

01:32.959 --> 01:35.095
23, but who's counting?

01:35.128 --> 01:37.197
Slater, you've got
to promise you'll win.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.433
Yeah, I'm sick of hearing
Valley's victory cheer.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.003
   "We won, I'm sure.
   We won, get real.

01:43.103 --> 01:47.007
   Valley's the best.
   Like forever's the deal."

01:47.107 --> 01:49.843
  Well, you know, guys,
  we're gonna, like,

01:49.876 --> 01:51.845
totally destroy those
Valley dudes, ya know.

01:51.878 --> 01:55.815
  And it's gonna be really,
  really gnarly.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.752
It'll be gnarly if we
sell these tiger tails.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.788
 I've got an idea.
 lf you attach
 the hat to the tails,

02:01.821 --> 02:05.058
  attach the hat
  to our star
  quarterback here...

02:05.058 --> 02:07.360
 Well, you have a stroke
 of marketing genius.

02:07.394 --> 02:10.062
Wait a minute.
I look stupid in this.

02:10.062 --> 02:12.899
   Hey, no problem.
   We'll just cover
   the stupid part.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.436
  That's a good idea.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.508
Hey guys. The truth...
how do I look?

02:21.541 --> 02:22.976
Full of cheer.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.478
  I'm serious.
  I want to be Queen.

02:25.512 --> 02:28.381
Well, we'll let you know
if anything
happens to Princess Di.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.183
   I'm talking about
   Homecoming Queen.

02:30.216 --> 02:32.218
   Come on,
   you're a shoo-in.

02:32.252 --> 02:35.121
 Guys bribe teachers
 just to sit
 beside you in class.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.257
  What if they found out
  I wear a retainer at night?

02:37.290 --> 02:40.093
 How is anyone
 going to find out
 you wear a retainer?

02:40.126 --> 02:42.529
  Wanna join
  our retainer club?

02:48.268 --> 02:50.370
 ( whistling )

02:50.403 --> 02:52.305
Screech, what are you
so happy about?

02:52.339 --> 02:55.342
 Look at this face.
 Tell me what you see.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.978
   Proof that there's life
   on other planets.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.514
 No, besides that.
 Look closer.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.518
All I see is a big zit.

03:06.586 --> 03:09.189
 Yeah, isn't it great?

03:10.423 --> 03:11.958
It's my first.

03:12.058 --> 03:13.560
   Say hi to Murray.

03:15.595 --> 03:19.799
   I hope Murray and you
   are very happy together.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.267
( bell rings )

03:25.405 --> 03:26.840
   What's he doing?

03:26.873 --> 03:28.408
  Zit gazing.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.944
  How gross.

03:30.977 --> 03:34.247
   Lisa, I'm sailing
   on my voyage to manhood.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.448
 Care to come aboard?

03:35.482 --> 03:38.518
   I'd rather be
   eaten by a shark.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.221
This is chemistry class,
not "Love Connection."

03:41.254 --> 03:42.956
   If you don't finish
   your experiments,

03:42.989 --> 03:45.291
   I'll have to experiment
   with your grades.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.994
 Just about finished,
 Mr. Bennett.

03:48.094 --> 03:49.896
 - Right, Screech?
 - Uh, right, Screech.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.198
  I mean, Mr. Bennet.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.235
   Just have to add
   a dash of that...

03:57.103 --> 04:00.306
   And as we watch,

04:00.340 --> 04:03.143
the solution
should solidify into...

04:11.351 --> 04:14.354
 Both:
 A malt for
 the Homecoming Queen.

04:14.387 --> 04:17.057
  - I was first.
  - In your dreams, Preppie.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.324
 - Hey, get lost.
 - You get...

04:18.358 --> 04:21.494
 Guys, I'll drink both of them,
 thank you.

04:21.528 --> 04:24.564
   How do you like my hair?
   Is it better up or down?

04:24.597 --> 04:26.232
   Give us a break.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.936
 Up. I think it accentuates
 your high cheekbones

04:29.969 --> 04:31.538
 and reveals
 your swan-like neck.

04:31.571 --> 04:35.141
 - You really think so?
 - Well, I like your hair down.

04:35.175 --> 04:38.244
 I think it brings out
 your mysterious eyes.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.080
  Good point.
  I'll wear it down.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.881
Hey, what does
Slater know about hair?

04:41.915 --> 04:45.885
 He styles his hair hanging out
 of the school bus window.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.655
   Yeah, well, Preppie here had
   to kill three moose

04:48.688 --> 04:50.357
  to get his hair like that.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.258
 - Yeah, well...
 - Well, what?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.094
   Hi, guys.

04:54.094 --> 04:57.097
 Hey look,
 Suzie dyed her hair.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.998
 Wow, she looks great.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.201
   Yeah,
   but not as good as Muffin
   looks in that mini-skirt.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.535
Slater:
Yeah, she does.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.304
 If you two stare any harder,

05:04.337 --> 05:07.574
   your eyes
   are gonna pop
   out like Slinkys.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.909
 Hey Kelly, aren't Suzie
 and Muffin the other finalists

05:09.943 --> 05:11.177
 for Homecoming Queen?

05:11.211 --> 05:13.146
   How would I know?

05:13.179 --> 05:15.181
You've got nothing
to worry about.

05:15.215 --> 05:18.051
  Next to you,
  they're puppy chow.

05:19.686 --> 05:23.256
Yeah,
I wouldn't give those two
bow-wows a second look.

05:23.289 --> 05:24.924
 Nah.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.664
Zack, quick,
you've got to help me.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.466
My worst nightmare
has come true.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.669
   You found out
   Alf was a puppet?

05:37.470 --> 05:39.072
He is?

05:41.207 --> 05:44.310
Worse than that!
My pimples disappeared.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.546
Murray's gone.

05:46.579 --> 05:49.516
   You're right.
   Murray's history.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.985
  Zack, you've got
  to help me.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.988
- I'm just a boy again.
- Screech, it's normal.

05:55.088 --> 05:58.091
  Pimples go away
  by themselves all the time.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.093
 In two hours?

06:00.126 --> 06:03.296
Well, maybe fast food
gives you fast pimples.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.266
 Did you
 wash your face today?

06:06.299 --> 06:09.536
   Why would I do that
   during the week?

06:09.569 --> 06:12.038
  Did you put anything else
  on your face today?

06:12.038 --> 06:14.240
 Only my chemistry experiment.

06:14.274 --> 06:17.944
 Screech,
 we might've stumbled upon
 the invention of a century...

06:18.044 --> 06:20.647
  a blemish cream
  that really works.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.416
 Hey, kids everywhere
 would pay a fortune.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.685
- Adults, too.
- Yeah.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.356
It could work
wonders for Gorbachev.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.525
   It's sort of like
   an acne Glasnost.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.761
   Hey, but we gotta
   put the cream to a test.

06:34.794 --> 06:38.431
   We gotta find a kid
   with just the right skin.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.433
 Both:
 "Crater-face" Coburn.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.268
  - Let's go find him.
  - Let's go get him.

06:43.169 --> 06:44.571
 Aren't you done yet?

06:44.604 --> 06:46.773
Hey, I can't go any faster,
Crater-face.

06:46.806 --> 06:49.476
 You've got too many
 speed bumps.

06:49.509 --> 06:52.078
 Do you really think
 this stuff will work?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.179
 Worked on me.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.148
  No it didn't.
  You're still here.

06:55.181 --> 06:57.550
 ( gasping laughter )

06:57.584 --> 07:00.053
Hey, hey, hey,
come on, guys, quit it.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.354
 All right, Charlie.
 You're done.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.356
  All right, now what about
  my 10 bucks?

07:03.390 --> 07:05.525
 Oh yeah.
 Here you go.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.029
  Hey, wait a minute.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.598
  Jason Bateman's
  not on a $10 bill.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.299
   Oh, you noticed.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.035
 Cash.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.038
 What's this?

07:18.038 --> 07:20.206
 You get the other half
   when you come back
 tomorrow before school.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.042
  And not a word to anybody.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.480
   Come on, Kelly.
   We're gonna be
   late for school.

07:27.514 --> 07:30.383
  I'm not going.
  I'm never coming out, ever.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.520
 Kelly, it's just a pimple.
 It's not the end of the world.

07:33.553 --> 07:34.821
  That's easy for you to say.

07:34.854 --> 07:39.092
 You don't have a lightbulb
 attached to
 the end of your nose.

07:41.194 --> 07:45.065
 Oh my gosh, Jessie.
 It's George
 Michael's new video.

07:45.065 --> 07:48.201
   - He's in bikini briefs.
   - I love George Michael.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.537
 But this is George Jetson.
 Creeps.

07:50.570 --> 07:51.871
Now can we go?

07:51.905 --> 07:54.174
 I'm not going to
 school with this
 thing on the end of my nose.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.676
   Let me take a look at it.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.778
Kelly, there's barely
anything there.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.780
   It looks like a freckle.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.582
   It may look
   like a freckle now,
   but by the end of the day

08:02.615 --> 08:05.485
I'll look like
Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

08:05.518 --> 08:08.121
Fine,
then you lead the way.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.025
Guys, this is serious.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.394
 Today's the Homecoming Parade.

08:19.466 --> 08:22.102
Hear ye, hear ye,
your attention please.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.771
   The Homecoming finalists
   have arrived.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.384
 Wow.

08:37.417 --> 08:42.087
   Quite a headlight
   you've got there, Kelly.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.357
  What happened to Kelly?
  She used to be
  such a pretty girl.

08:44.391 --> 08:47.293
   You mean Big Red?

08:47.327 --> 08:50.230
Gee, Slater.
Is that the same girl
we used to fight over?

08:50.263 --> 08:54.367
 You gotta admit it, Preppie,
 she can still light up a room.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.207
  Don't you guys understand?

09:01.241 --> 09:04.044
  I've never won anything
  before in my life.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.046
  Kelly, you're overreacting.

09:06.079 --> 09:10.450
 Look,
 this is my mom's crown from
 when she won Homecoming Queen.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.252
 I want to make her
 proud of me.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.088
  You don't have
  to win a contest
  to make your parents proud.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.723
   Well, maybe not.

09:16.756 --> 09:21.227
But if I win, I could be in
the Kapowski
spotlight for once.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.229
 With seven kids in the family,

09:23.263 --> 09:25.098
   it's not often
   you get to feel special.

09:25.131 --> 09:28.501
  Hey,
  you're not getting any votes
  staying home. So, let's go.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.603
   But what about
   my Rudolph nose?

09:30.637 --> 09:32.739
  No one is going to notice.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.742
 Kelly, want to do something
 about that unsightly blemish?

09:35.775 --> 09:38.712
 Try new "Zit-Off."
 Free
 demonstration by the locker.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.580
 I thought you said
 no one would notice.

09:40.613 --> 09:43.149
No one did notice.
Will you look?

09:43.183 --> 09:45.852
   Ladies and gentleman,
   boys and girls...

09:45.885 --> 09:49.489
 hey, anyone with money.
 Well, step right up.

09:49.522 --> 09:52.826
The amazing pimple
demonstration is
about to begin.

09:52.859 --> 09:56.329
 Now, you say you're tired
 of those unwelcome blemishes?

09:56.363 --> 09:59.766
Well, I've got
the product for you...

09:59.799 --> 10:01.301
  "Zit-Off,"

10:01.334 --> 10:05.338
   the one-stop shop
   for all your acne needs.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.408
Cut to the chase, Preppie.
Let's see how it works.

10:08.441 --> 10:12.612
  Just simply dab a little
  "Zit Off" on
  the problem areas,

10:12.645 --> 10:15.248
  and watch those
  embarrassing bumps

10:15.281 --> 10:18.318
disappear
before your very eyes.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.654
Come on, this is a rip-off.
His face is
clear to start with.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.289
  All: Yeah!

10:23.323 --> 10:24.958
But this is the before,

10:24.991 --> 10:27.360
and this is the after.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.934
  Is that Crater-face Coburn?

10:34.968 --> 10:38.438
   In the new,
   smooth aerodynamic model.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.441
No way.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.677
  Hey look, Preppie here
  just hired some look-alike

10:43.710 --> 10:45.445
 with a good complexion
 to fool us.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.746
  All: Yeah!

10:46.780 --> 10:48.948
 Charles,
 give the man some ID.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.784
   ( gasping laugh )

10:52.585 --> 10:54.587
  Now, just $15 separates you

10:54.621 --> 10:56.823
 from the complexion
 you've always dreamed about.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.426
All major credit
cards accepted.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.828
 Zack: Whoa!
 All right, all right.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.608
  And how many tubes
  can I get for you?

11:15.642 --> 11:16.843
  I'll take them all.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.579
Sorry, the limit's six.

11:19.612 --> 11:23.450
   But I think we
   can make a special
   arrangement in your case.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.286
Let's haul your case
into my office.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.787
 Now!

11:34.994 --> 11:38.465
 You know, Zack, I have had it
 up to here with your antics.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.767
  And I'm a tall guy.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.304
 Yes, you are, sir.
 Hey,
 I've always looked up to you.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.706
 Put a hold on the bootlicking.

11:46.740 --> 11:50.577
  - Holding, sir.
  - This time you
  have gone too far,

11:50.610 --> 11:53.980
  turning Bayside into your own
  personal blemish bazaar.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.715
Now who's your
cohort in crime, here?

11:55.749 --> 11:58.318
 Me sir, Crater-face.

11:58.351 --> 12:01.788
Get out of town!
You're kidding.

12:01.821 --> 12:03.523
   Chuckle, Charlie.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.059
   ( gasping laugh )

12:06.059 --> 12:08.762
   Wow, it is you, Charlie.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.764
   It is a miracle.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.533
 Yes.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.069
  But it's
  a shame that more kids
  won't have the opportunity

12:16.069 --> 12:17.937
for a crater-free life.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.073
  Sorry, Morris,
  but not on my turf.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.343
  But we'd set up
  dispensers next
  to all the candy machines.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.578
 Of course the school will
 receive half of the proceeds.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.313
   No sale.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.282
  But we've even
  name it after you.

12:29.315 --> 12:32.352
   We'd call it, "Beldasil."

12:34.921 --> 12:38.391
  "Beldasil."
  That has a nice ring to it.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.927
  Sleep on it, sir.
  We'll work out
  the details in the morning.

12:40.960 --> 12:45.465
 No, I think we'll work out
 the details at 3:30.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.534
 See you in detention.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.970
Take "Babyface"
here with you.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.808
   Beldasil.

13:05.585 --> 13:08.822
Zack, I heard Belding
came down hard on you.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.791
   Well, it was your basic
   give-and-take conference.

13:11.825 --> 13:15.829
He gave me detention
and I took it.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.431
   Did he take away
all that cream
   you were selling?

13:18.465 --> 13:21.868
   I managed to save a few
   for an oily day.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.572
 Zack, you're a life saver.
 Can I have one?

13:25.605 --> 13:28.341
  I'll pay any price you ask.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.910
  This is the stuff
  dreams are made of.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.581
 But Kelly,
 your skin is perfect.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.883
It's not for me,
it's for a... a friend.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.886
 Actually, a friend of a friend
 who swore me to secrecy.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.988
 I see. Tell you what,

13:42.088 --> 13:43.990
   your "friend" sounds
   pretty desperate.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.726
  Just give her
  this and we'll figure
  out a way to pay me later.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.461
 Thanks, Zack.
 I owe you a big one.

13:48.495 --> 13:52.432
   - I mean, for my friend.
   - Right.

13:52.465 --> 13:56.903
 Once Kelly's "friend"
 tries out the cream,
 she'll be mine forever.

13:56.936 --> 14:00.874
 This is turning out to be
 a pretty decent day after all.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.842
  Zack, you've gotta help me!

14:05.645 --> 14:06.846
   Screech, what did you do
   to your face?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.782
  You look like
  a raspberry pizza.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.116
  It's the "Zit-Off."

14:10.150 --> 14:13.353
 Something must happen
 when it homogenizes.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.124
   Whatever it touches,
   it turns maroon.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.160
   Well, did you try
   scrubbing it off?

14:20.193 --> 14:23.096
  I've even tried
  running through a car wash.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.666
   I think it's cream-burn.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.835
Screech,
tell me you're joking.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.138
My whole future
is riding on your face.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.940
 Fasten your seatbelt,

14:33.973 --> 14:36.476
  it's going
  to be a bumpy ride.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.785
 Screech, we've got to
 find Kelly before
 she tries out that cream.

14:45.819 --> 14:47.754
Would you get your
tail out here?

14:47.787 --> 14:50.423
- Come on.
- It's not easy, Zack.

14:50.457 --> 14:53.126
 These stripes
 are making me dizzy.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.464
 How long do I have to keep
 this mascot outfit on anyway?

14:57.497 --> 14:59.199
 Until your face
 turns back to normal

14:59.232 --> 15:02.302
  or we're safely
  in another country.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.105
 Zack, that "Zit-Off" worked
 great. It dried up my
 skin in a second.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.741
 It's a miracle.
 Zack, you're gonna be famous.

15:07.774 --> 15:11.044
   - Thanks, man.
   - Yeah, you bet.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.712
   Yeah, I'm gonna be
   famous all right.

15:12.746 --> 15:16.316
  "Student attacked by blotchy,
  maroon mob. Film at 11:00."

15:17.851 --> 15:20.487
What channel?
I'll stay up and watch.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.394
 Zack, you're the best.
 The cream worked like a charm.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.230
   You mean your "friend"
   used it already?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.899
 Okay, no more lies.
 There was no friend.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.535
  The cream was for me.
  I had this
  thing on the end of my nose

15:35.568 --> 15:38.071
 and well, it doesn't really
 matter now, 'cause it's gone,

15:38.071 --> 15:39.339
   and I have you to thank.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.142
 Maybe we can go
 out this weekend?
 See a movie?

15:42.175 --> 15:44.944
 Yeah, that'd be great.
 Anyplace that's dark.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.082
   I'm a dead man, Screech.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.817
By tomorrow morning
most of Bayside

15:50.850 --> 15:53.420
and the girl of my dreams
will have maroon faces.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.355
   Maybe no one will notice.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.891
 I think that tiger's head
 is frying your brain.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.293
   Why are you still wearing
   that stupid thing anyway?

16:00.326 --> 16:03.163
 You told me to keep it on
 so no one would see my face.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.032
In school,
not my bedroom.

16:06.032 --> 16:09.035
  Like I'm supposed
  to read between the lines.

16:13.440 --> 16:17.043
 Screech, your face...
 it's back to normal.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.446
Don't toy
with my emotions, Zack.

16:19.479 --> 16:23.350
  Under this gruff
  maroon exterior
  is a bucket of sensitivity.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.818
  No.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.553
 Look.

16:26.586 --> 16:30.590
  - I'm whole again! Yahoo!
  - This is great.

16:30.623 --> 16:33.259
 Hey,
 that means the maroon-ness
 is only temporary.

16:33.293 --> 16:37.063
 I won't have to join
 the Peace Corps. Yes!

16:37.063 --> 16:39.199
   But the Homecoming Rally
   is tomorrow.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.067
   What about Kelly?

16:41.968 --> 16:45.071
  I'm down, but I'm not out.

16:45.105 --> 16:48.441
 I just have to figure out
 a way to hide Kelly's
 face for one day.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.379
 ( knocking on door )

16:57.283 --> 17:00.453
Zack, what are
you doing here?

17:00.487 --> 17:03.523
 Kelly, there's something
 important I have to tell you.

17:03.556 --> 17:07.327
  - What is it?
  - Oh, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.496
 You know when we're in college
 we're going to
 laugh about this.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.065
 Hey,
 so why don't we start now?
 ( laughs )

17:12.098 --> 17:14.867
   Zack, what is it?

17:15.935 --> 17:18.038
Well...

17:18.070 --> 17:20.839
 the "Zit-Off" removes pimples,
 then it turns
 your face maroon,

17:20.874 --> 17:23.376
 but it's only temporary
 and a day later it goes
  away and you're fine.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.278
 I knew you'd take it well.
 See ya.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.880
 Zack.

17:26.913 --> 17:30.216
 Are you saying my face
 is gonna turn maroon?

17:30.250 --> 17:33.353
 Not your whole face.
 Just where you put the cream.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.921
 Where did you put the cream?

17:34.954 --> 17:36.589
  Well, here, here, and here.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.225
 - That's all?
 - Then I rubbed it all over.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.461
 Boy, that was stupid.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.931
  When is this
  supposed to happen?

17:44.964 --> 17:47.334
  - Tomorrow.
  - Tomorrow?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.402
 How could you do this to me?

17:49.436 --> 17:51.538
 Tomorrow they're picking
 the Homecoming Queen.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.473
  Zack, you're a...
  you're a...

17:53.506 --> 17:55.275
  you're something
  really, really bad.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.677
  I didn't twist your arm
  to use that cream.

17:57.711 --> 17:59.612
  You're the prettiest girl
  in school.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.916
 So what if you're slightly
 less than perfect
 for a day or two?

18:03.016 --> 18:07.287
Hey, lately, it seems
all you care
about is how you look.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.023
  Zack, I can't believe
  you just said that.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.926
Pretend it was Slater.

18:14.928 --> 18:18.031
Zack, you've turned
my face maroon.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.900
 You've ruined my chances
 of becoming Homecoming Queen.

18:20.934 --> 18:24.471
   I want you out of my room
   and out of my life, now!

18:26.606 --> 18:29.509
- Are we still on
for the weekend?
 - Out!

18:33.313 --> 18:36.049
   And now for a word
   from our captain.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.054
Thanks.

18:41.054 --> 18:43.723
 Well, guys,
 all I've got to say is this...

18:43.757 --> 18:47.293
   surf's up, Valley,
   'cause the Tigers
   are on the prowl!

18:47.327 --> 18:49.162
 Yeah!

18:49.195 --> 18:51.431
  We're gonna maul you! Yeah!

18:53.366 --> 18:57.337
Like, for sure.

18:57.370 --> 19:01.007
   Okay, we've just tallied
   the votes for
   Homecoming Queen.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.143
Second runner-up is...

19:03.176 --> 19:05.078
Muffin Sangria!

19:11.184 --> 19:13.053
And first runner-up...

19:13.086 --> 19:15.088
Susie Van Feyk!

19:20.326 --> 19:22.562
   And now for our
   Homecoming Queen,

19:22.595 --> 19:27.033
 the girl who has school spirit
 written all over her face,

19:27.067 --> 19:28.535
Kelly Kapowski!

19:28.568 --> 19:30.570
 ( cheering )

19:35.608 --> 19:37.711
   Hi. Thanks everybody,
   for making me your Queen,

19:37.744 --> 19:40.580
 even though I look like this.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.483
Well, how about
a little Bayside cheer?

19:46.419 --> 19:48.254
( beat-boxing )

19:51.124 --> 19:53.059
  <i>* Check this out</i>
  <i>we've got something to say</i>

19:53.093 --> 19:55.228
<i>*About the tigers from Bayside</i>
<i>gonna rule the day</i>

19:55.261 --> 19:57.230
  <i>* So clap your hands</i>
  <i>and stomp your feet</i>

19:57.263 --> 20:00.100
<i>* Hey we got school spirit</i>
<i>we can't be beat</i>

20:00.133 --> 20:02.235
    All: <i>* Beat ba-beat</i>

20:02.268 --> 20:04.371

20:21.721 --> 20:23.590
 ( cheering )

20:25.425 --> 20:27.093
  Go Bayside!

20:27.127 --> 20:28.595
 Yeah!

20:32.732 --> 20:36.403
   Zack, Zack, Zack,
   I got to hand it to you,

20:36.436 --> 20:39.272
  having
  the students paint their
  faces to show school spirit

20:39.305 --> 20:42.776
  was, well, it takes my
  b-b-b-breath away.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.644
  ( laughs )

20:44.678 --> 20:47.447
  Sure you don't
  want to join us, sir,
  and paint your face maroon?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.582
 I'm with you in spirit, Zack.

20:49.616 --> 20:53.119
  But I am the principal
  and I think that for me...

20:54.421 --> 20:56.823
  it would be
  just a little rash.

20:59.225 --> 21:02.395
  Zack, I want to apologize.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.130
   You were right about me.

21:04.164 --> 21:07.167
 I got so wrapped up
 in becoming Homecoming Queen,

21:07.200 --> 21:10.170
  I became a royal pain.
  Thanks for helping me win.

21:10.203 --> 21:13.139
 Hey,
 a little Bayside war paint
 goes a long way.

21:13.173 --> 21:14.607
Thanks.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.580
 Oh, since you won't be around
 to see the rest of the game,

21:20.613 --> 21:22.248
 I'll tell you what happened.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.783
<i>Valley was so terrified</i>

21:23.817 --> 21:26.453
  <i>at the sight</i>
  <i>of all those maroon faces,</i>

21:26.486 --> 21:29.255
  <i>that they fumbled</i>
  <i>the opening kickoff</i>

21:29.289 --> 21:32.258
  <i>and Slater scored</i>
  <i>the only touchdown.</i>

21:32.292 --> 21:34.627
   The Tigers won
   seven to nothing.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.163
 Go B-b-b-Bayside!
 Whoo!

21:47.507 --> 21:50.343
  ( instrumental
  theme music plays )
