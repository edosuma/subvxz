04:36.844 --> 04:38.846
I GOT 500 MEN HERE.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.815
HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO FIND OUT
WHO KILLED YOUR WHORE ?

04:41.915 --> 04:44.618
I DON'T CARE IF YOU FIND
THE RIGHT GUY OR NOT.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.954

04:47.054 --> 04:48.789

04:48.889 --> 04:50.257
WE DON'T RIGHTLY CARE,

04:50.358 --> 04:52.660
LONG AS SOMEONE STANDS TALL

05:24.425 --> 05:26.794

05:26.894 --> 05:30.531
WHEN THE MIDWAY CLEARS OUT,
LET'S GET A HEAD COUNT.

05:30.631 --> 05:33.401
MANAGEMENT WANTS TO MAKE SURE
WE AIN'T MISSING NOBODY ELSE.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.503
NO MORE OF
THIS MANAGEMENT CRAP.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.004
JUST SAY
WHAT YOU WANT.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.640

05:39.740 --> 05:42.275
YOU WANT ME TO FOLLOW ORDERS,
THAT'S DUTCH WITH ME.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.912
BUT JUST STOP SPINNING
THESE FAIRY TALES.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.981
THERE AIN'T
NO MANAGEMENT.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.883

WHAT YOU THINK ?

05:49.983 --> 05:51.051
WHAT I KNOW.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.453

IN THE TRAILER ?!

05:54.287 --> 05:55.856
AND THERE'S NO ONE
IN THERE, SAMSON.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.558
NO ONE.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.827
WELL, IN THE FIRST PLACE,
YOU LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

05:59.927 --> 06:03.831

06:03.931 --> 06:05.165
AH, BULLSHIT, SAMSON,
BULLSHIT !

06:05.265 --> 06:07.435
THERE AIN'T
NO MANAGEMENT.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.103

06:50.010 --> 06:51.344
GOT A HEAD COUNT.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.213
NO ONE MISSING EXCEPT
HAWKINS AND LODZ.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.149
WELL, MANAGEMENT SAYS WE DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM.

06:56.249 --> 07:00.420

07:00.521 --> 07:02.556

07:02.656 --> 07:05.459

IN THAT CAB TELLING YOU

07:05.559 --> 07:07.461
THESE CRAZY STORIES

07:07.561 --> 07:09.597
PULLING THE WHOLE THING
STRAIGHT OUTTA MY ASS ?

07:09.697 --> 07:12.866
IS THAT WHAT YOU
THINK OF ME ?

07:12.966 --> 07:16.369
I WAS IN THE TRAILER.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.572
THAT DON'T MEAN SQUAT.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.674
LOOK, IF MANAGEMENT...

07:20.774 --> 07:23.343
IF HE DON'T WANT
TO BE SEEN, THEN...

07:23.443 --> 07:27.314
THEN HE AIN'T GONNA
BE SEEN, I SUPPOSE.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.650
HE, HE CAN DO THAT.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.319
HE CAN DO LOTS
OF THINGS...

07:32.419 --> 07:36.757
SAVE IT
FOR THE RUBES.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.896

"AND IT CAME TO PASS
AFTER THESE THINGS,

07:42.996 --> 07:46.867

08:00.380 --> 08:03.350
BUT YOU SPED
ISAAC, LORD.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.653
WHY NOT MY CHILDREN ?

14:00.073 --> 14:03.643
WHO PLAYED FOOTBALL
AND JOINED THE ARMY.

14:03.743 --> 14:08.081
WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH A SISTER ?

14:08.181 --> 14:13.253
JUST FIGHT
ALL THE TIME.

14:22.662 --> 14:28.035
BAD THINGS HAPPEN
IN THIS WORLD.

14:28.135 --> 14:33.206
MOMMA SAYS THINGS
ARE BETTER IN THE NEXT.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.449

17:20.407 --> 17:24.411
GOT IT FROM THOSE TWO RUBES
DOWN IN SWEETWATER LAST YEAR.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.514
THEY SAID THEY
COULDN'T PAY,

17:27.614 --> 17:30.350
BUT THEN THEY REMEMBERED
THEY HAD A BOLT

17:30.450 --> 17:32.485
OF THEIR
GRANDMAMMY'S SILK.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.979
( grunting )

28:12.358 --> 28:15.061
IS THAT
DEEP ENOUGH ?

28:38.684 --> 28:40.486
IT'S ALL SET.

28:40.586 --> 28:45.958
'BOUT 200 YARDS SOUTH,
ON A RISE.

28:48.995 --> 28:50.529
AFTER WE PACK UP...

28:50.629 --> 28:54.333
I'M MOVING ON.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.606
WHERE TO ?

29:00.706 --> 29:02.608
TULSA, MAYBE.

29:02.708 --> 29:05.111
DAILY BROTHERS CARNIVAL

29:05.211 --> 29:07.013
SHOULD BE HEADING THROUGH
THERE IN THE NEXT MONTH.

29:07.113 --> 29:11.750
DAILY BROTHERS',
IT'S A GOOD OUTFIT.

29:11.851 --> 29:15.187
SO I HEAR.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.095
JONESY.

29:23.195 --> 29:27.766
THERE'S MEN YOU TRUST
AND MEN YOU DON'T TRUST.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.837
I TRUSTED YOU,

29:30.937 --> 29:33.572
EVEN WHEN
NO ONE ELSE WOULD.

29:33.672 --> 29:39.345
I'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S
WAYS GONE BOTH WAYS.

31:48.140 --> 31:52.311
LORD, I KNEW
THIS GIRL.

31:52.411 --> 31:56.515
HER NAME WAS
DORA MAE DREIFUSS.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.685
SHE WAS LIKE
KIN TO ME...

31:59.785 --> 32:02.989
AND EVERYONE
STANDING HERE.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.291
YOU KNOW HER, LORD.

32:05.391 --> 32:08.460
YOU KNOW SHE HAD
A HARD LIFE.

32:08.560 --> 32:12.431
SOME OF WHAT SHE DONE,
YOU MAY NOT APPROVE OF.

32:12.531 --> 32:16.102
SOME OF WHAT SHE DONE
YOU MAY CALL SIN.

32:16.202 --> 32:20.506
BUT SHE WAS
A GOOD GIRL, LORD,

32:20.606 --> 32:23.709
AND WE LOVED HER.

32:23.809 --> 32:27.879
AND WE WANT YOU
TO WELCOME HER
INTO YOUR ARMS.

32:27.980 --> 32:32.951
AND WE KNOW
YOU WILL.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.743
DORA MAE...

33:00.846 --> 33:03.249
YOU WAS A REAL
GOOD DANCER.

33:05.517 --> 33:06.818
LIB !

33:06.918 --> 33:08.754
LIB !

33:10.656 --> 33:16.128
( singing in French )

34:50.055 --> 34:52.824
THIS IS FROM
MANAGEMENT.

34:52.924 --> 34:56.027
HE GOT IT
IN THE OLD COUNTRY.

34:56.128 --> 35:00.366
HE SAID IT'LL
NEVER NEED WINDING.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.981
WALK ME BACK ?

35:16.081 --> 35:19.285
SURE.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.392
EVERYTHING'S CHANGING.

35:26.492 --> 35:29.461
NOTHING'S THE WAY
IT USED TO BE.

35:29.561 --> 35:32.464
THAT IS A FACT.

35:32.564 --> 35:36.935
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
HOME, EITHER.

35:37.035 --> 35:40.306
IT FEELS
LIKE A PRISON.

35:40.406 --> 35:45.143
AND I CAN'T LEAVE MOMMA.

35:45.244 --> 35:48.847
I CAN'T KEEP GOING.

35:48.947 --> 35:51.917
I'M TRAPPED.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.890
SOPH...

36:08.200 --> 36:10.636
SAMSON !

36:10.736 --> 36:13.472
SAMSON !

36:15.307 --> 36:19.177
STILL ONE MAN
LEFT IN BABYLON.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.739
( sighing )

37:00.652 --> 37:02.254
READY ?

37:04.656 --> 37:05.524
EASY...

37:15.100 --> 37:16.835
GABE, LET'S DO IT.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.704
EASY.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.506
THING'S ANCIENT.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.574
GO.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.832
( sniffing )

37:46.932 --> 37:49.601
I KNOW YOU'RE
HERE, BOY.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.137
GOOD FOR YOU.

37:52.237 --> 37:56.141
WOULD THAT BE THE SOUND
OF A DECREPIT WAGON

37:56.241 --> 37:59.778
THAT LOOKS AS IF NOAH
HAD IT ON THE ARK ?

37:59.878 --> 38:02.881
YEAH, GABRIEL'S HAULING IT
TO THE TEN-IN-ONE.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.617
THEN YOU'RE
IN LUCK, HAWKINS.

38:05.717 --> 38:09.988
YOU'RE ABOUT TO PARTICIPATE
IN AN OBSCURE,

38:10.088 --> 38:13.725
BUT FASCINATING, RITUAL,
KNOWN AS...

38:13.825 --> 38:15.994
CARNIVAL JUSTICE.

38:16.094 --> 38:18.964
NOT TO BE MISSED.

38:39.084 --> 38:41.520
CLOSE THE FLAP !

38:47.626 --> 38:50.462
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SON ?

38:50.562 --> 38:52.864
YOU KNOW MY NAME.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.500
PROTOCOL.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.935
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

38:57.035 --> 38:59.170
STANGLER.

38:59.270 --> 39:02.040
YOU LIVE
IN BABYLON ?

39:02.140 --> 39:05.276
"LIVE" AIN'T
THE WORD I WOULD USE.

39:05.377 --> 39:07.813
DO YOU RESIDE THERE ?

39:07.913 --> 39:10.482
YEAH, I GUESS I DO.

39:10.582 --> 39:13.919
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
HERE LAST NIGHT ?

39:14.019 --> 39:17.489
I HEARD
SOMEONE DIED.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.558
SHE WAS KILLED.

39:19.658 --> 39:22.260
DEFILED AND KILLED,
ACTUALLY.

39:22.360 --> 39:26.097
TERRIBLE THING.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.534
CERTAINLY IS.

39:28.634 --> 39:31.336
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE
THAT WE WANTED JUSTICE,

39:31.437 --> 39:35.407
BUT WHEN WE ROLLED
INTO TOWN TODAY,

39:35.507 --> 39:40.512
THERE WASN'T
A SOUL THERE.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.949
AM I BEING FUNNY ?

39:44.049 --> 39:47.819
I GUESS NOT.

39:47.919 --> 39:51.156
BUT TRUTH IS, THERE'S
A LOT OF SOULS IN BABYLON.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.759
A LOT OF 'EM.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.594
WELL, WE DIDN'T SEE
NO ONE THERE THIS MORNING.

39:55.694 --> 39:58.730
OH, THEY'RE
STILL THERE.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.199
WELL, I GUESS IT'S JUST YOUR
BAD LUCK THEN THAT WE FOUND YOU,

40:01.299 --> 40:02.333
ISN'T IT ?

40:02.434 --> 40:04.970
GET ON WITH IT,
SAMSON !

40:09.074 --> 40:10.976
BRING IT IN.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.691
WHAT'S HE DOING ?

40:25.791 --> 40:30.195
THE WAGON IS CIRCLED THREE TIMES
AROUND THE ACCUSED,

40:30.295 --> 40:33.331
WHY THREE TIMES ?

40:33.431 --> 40:38.737
I DOUBT ANYONE HERE
EVEN REMEMBERS.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.507
BUT THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S ALWAYS DONE.

40:49.515 --> 40:52.518
SPEAK THE NAME
OF THE DEAD.

40:52.618 --> 40:56.121
( all )
DORA MAE DREIFUSS.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.289
ONE OF OURS IS DEAD.

40:58.389 --> 41:01.493
ONE OF THEIRS
IS GONNA ANSWER FOR IT.

41:01.593 --> 41:07.198
PICK A NUMBER,
ONE THROUGH SIX.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.768
WHAT DO YA MEAN ?

41:09.868 --> 41:13.404
I MEAN, PICK A NUMBER
ONE THROUGH SIX.

41:13.505 --> 41:16.007
WHY ?

41:16.107 --> 41:18.510
IF YOU DON'T PICK ONE,
WE'LL PICK ONE FOR YOU.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.647
SIX SOUNDS
GOOD TO ME.

41:24.449 --> 41:26.752
THREE.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.486
THREE !

41:28.587 --> 41:31.489
THE NUMBER IS THREE.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.439
HE'S JUST GONNA
SHOOT 'EM DEAD RIGHT HERE ?

41:48.540 --> 41:49.775
HE'LL HAVE A CHANCE.

41:49.875 --> 41:52.944
MORE OF A CHANCE
THAN DORA MAE DID.

41:56.915 --> 42:00.051
Y'ALL DON'T EVEN KNOW IF
HE'S THE ONE WHO EVEN DID IT ?

42:00.151 --> 42:01.553
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

42:01.653 --> 42:04.122
THERE'S TIMES WHEN WE HAVE
TO MAKE OUR OWN JUSTICE.

42:04.222 --> 42:07.993
THIS IS WHO
WE ARE, BEN.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.429
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY,

42:11.529 --> 42:15.066
NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.873
I SEE WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.876
AND I UNDERSTAND,
I REALLY DO.

42:24.976 --> 42:30.048
CAN'T SAY I BLAME YOU
NONE, EITHER.

42:30.148 --> 42:33.785
BUT...

42:33.885 --> 42:37.623
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF SNAP
IN HER GARTER, THAT ONE.

42:37.723 --> 42:40.291
SHE WEREN'T
NO GOOD GIRL.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.928
( shouting )

42:47.766 --> 42:50.368
IF ONE'S TAKEN,
IT'S BEST IT'S HER.

42:50.468 --> 42:54.339
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND...

42:54.439 --> 42:57.676
WE AIN'T GOT NO WOMEN
HERE IN BABYLON.

42:57.776 --> 43:01.446
BE RIGHT NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE
TO DANCE WITH EVERY NIGHT.

43:01.546 --> 43:02.914
WHAT'RE YOU SAYING ?

43:03.014 --> 43:04.683
YOU KILLED HER SO YOU
COULD DANCE WITH HER ?

43:04.783 --> 43:06.417
SHE'LL BE FINE...

43:06.517 --> 43:07.653
WELL, MAYBE NOT FINE,

43:07.753 --> 43:09.387
BUT I'LL WATCH OUT
FOR HER AS BEST I CAN--

43:09.487 --> 43:10.856
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS,
HE DID IT.

43:10.956 --> 43:12.423
HE'S THE MAN
THAT DID IT.

43:12.523 --> 43:15.627
PULL THE GODDAMN
TRIGGER, SAMSON !

43:19.965 --> 43:20.866
OKAY, OKAY.

43:20.966 --> 43:22.300
BUT DON'T DO IT HERE,
NOT HERE.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.202
I DIE HERE, I STAY HERE,
JUST LIKE THE REST OF THEM.

43:24.302 --> 43:26.004
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
SINCE SCUDDER LEFT.

43:26.104 --> 43:28.139
WHAT'S THAT ?

43:28.239 --> 43:29.841
JUST TAKE ME OVER THE HILL
BEFORE YOU DO IT.

43:29.941 --> 43:31.309
THAT'S ALL
I'M ASKING.

43:31.409 --> 43:33.478
JUST TAKE ME OVER
THE HILL, PLEASE.

43:33.578 --> 43:35.246
WHY ?

43:35.346 --> 43:37.248
WHAT'S OVER THE HILL ?

43:37.348 --> 43:39.985
NOTHING.

43:40.085 --> 43:41.787
NOTHING AT ALL.

43:41.887 --> 43:44.122
IT JUST AIN'T HERE.

43:44.222 --> 43:50.195
PULL THE TRIGGER
ON THE SONOFABITCH.

43:59.671 --> 44:01.239
ONE !

44:13.284 --> 44:14.853
TWO !

44:30.501 --> 44:32.270
PULL IT AGAIN.

44:32.370 --> 44:33.404
PULL IT AGAIN,
SAMSON.

44:33.504 --> 44:37.075
( all shouting )
PULL IT AGAIN !

44:40.278 --> 44:42.914
THAT AIN'T THE WAY !

44:43.014 --> 44:45.283
THAT AIN'T THE WAY
WE DO THIS !

44:45.383 --> 44:47.585
WE GOT RULES.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.855
HE CONFESSED, SAMSON !

44:49.955 --> 44:52.157
HOW CAN YOU
STAND THERE AND--

44:52.257 --> 44:53.424
FELIX !

44:53.524 --> 44:58.329
I BURIED THREE CHILDREN
BEFORE TODAY.

44:58.429 --> 45:01.132
INFLUEA, TOOK TWO,

45:01.232 --> 45:03.534
AND ONE WAS STILLBORN.

45:03.634 --> 45:06.537
BUT ME AND FELIX,
WE GOT THROUGH THAT

45:06.637 --> 45:09.140
BECAUSE IT WAS
GOD'S WILL.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.376
BUT LAST NIGHT...

45:11.476 --> 45:16.114
LAST NIGHT WAS
NOT GOD'S WILL !

45:16.214 --> 45:17.849
IT WAS THIS MAN !

45:17.949 --> 45:19.717
AND HE IS GONNA
PAY FOR IT.

45:19.818 --> 45:24.322
NOW, I WOULD LIKE
MY HUSBAND'S GUN BACK.

45:30.595 --> 45:32.563
THE MAN PICKED
HIS NUMBER.

45:32.663 --> 45:36.968
THAT'S THE END OF IT.

45:39.304 --> 45:43.809
RITA SUE, STUMPY,
LIBBY, I'M SORRY.

45:43.909 --> 45:47.112
BUT WE AIN'T
DOING THIS.

45:47.212 --> 45:51.382
THE MAN PICKED
HIS NUMBER.

45:54.986 --> 45:56.654
WE GOT A CODE HERE.

45:56.754 --> 46:01.026
WE BREAK THE CODE,
WE GOT NOTHING LEFT.

46:04.796 --> 46:06.531
NOW YOU TWO
TAKE THIS SONOFABITCH

46:06.631 --> 46:08.533
AND BRING HIM
BACK TO TOWN,

46:08.633 --> 46:11.336
SAFE AND SOUND.

46:11.436 --> 46:12.804
HEY !

46:12.904 --> 46:15.773
NOT A HAIR FROM HIS HEAD
OR YOU ANSWER TO ME.

46:15.874 --> 46:17.843
YOU GOT IT ?

46:18.643 --> 46:19.978
GO !

46:23.648 --> 46:26.051
OKAY, IT'S LOW TIME,
WE'RE PACKING UP.

46:26.151 --> 46:30.088
MANAGEMENT WANTS US
ON THE ROAD BY DAWN !

46:32.223 --> 46:35.961
OKAY, YOU HEARD
THE MAN.

46:36.061 --> 46:39.264
MANAGEMENT GIVES
THE ORDERS, WE JUMP !

46:39.364 --> 46:40.665
THEM'S THE RULES !

46:40.765 --> 46:43.334
ABE, GET THAT WAGON OUTTA HERE,
BRING THIS CANVAS DOWN !

46:43.434 --> 46:45.270
HAWKINS, YOU AND SCHMIDT
ARE ON COLOSSUS !

46:45.370 --> 46:46.905
LET'S GO.

47:16.301 --> 47:19.337
BUT I NEVER
SAW HER AGAIN.

47:19.437 --> 47:22.407
SHE LEFT WITH MY MONEY,
WITH MY BEST FRIEND,

47:22.507 --> 47:24.976
WITH MY CAR EVEN,
SHE LEFT WITH MY CAR.

47:25.076 --> 47:29.080
SO I STARTED
RIDING THE RAILS.

47:29.180 --> 47:31.950
I DECIDED, HEY,
THIS IS THE LIFE.

47:32.050 --> 47:33.952
I DON'T NEED A JOB.

47:34.052 --> 47:39.590
AND SO
I'M A HAPPY MAN.

47:39.690 --> 47:42.660
THAT'S IT ?

47:42.760 --> 47:44.896
THAT'S THE END ?

47:44.996 --> 47:46.797
THAT'S IT.

47:46.898 --> 47:50.368
BUT I COULD TELL
ANOTHER STORY, THOUGH.

47:50.468 --> 47:51.702
'BOUT THE TIME
I WAS IN--

47:51.802 --> 47:53.238
NO, LET'S, UH...

47:53.338 --> 47:56.041
LET'S LET SOMEONE ELSE
TALK FOR A CHANGE.

47:59.010 --> 48:01.246
HOW ABOUT YOU,
FRIEND ?

48:01.346 --> 48:04.382
YOU GOT A STORY TO TELL
AROUND THE CAMPFIRE ?

48:04.482 --> 48:07.152
FRIEND ?

48:07.252 --> 48:11.389
YOU GOT
A STORY TO TELL ?

48:11.489 --> 48:14.459
YOU KNOW, LOST YOUR JOB,
LOST YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

48:14.559 --> 48:18.529
LOST YOUR DOG ?

48:21.032 --> 48:23.501
I LOST MY GOD.

48:27.205 --> 48:29.707
NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE PRESENT AT THIS TIME,

48:29.807 --> 48:32.210
"TRUE TALES
FROM ON THE ROAD,"

48:32.310 --> 48:35.580
REPORTED BY OUR OWN
TOMMY DOLAN.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.815
GOOD EVENING,
FRIENDS.

48:37.915 --> 48:40.351
TONIGHT, I'D LIKE
TO TELL YOU ANOTHER STORY

48:40.451 --> 48:42.820
I FOUND ON THE ROAD IN
THGREAT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.756
IT'S THE STORY
OF A PREACHER

48:45.856 --> 48:47.292
WHO TRIED TO BRING HOPE
TO THE HOPELESS,

48:47.392 --> 48:49.760
TRIED TO LIFT UP
THE DOWNTRODDEN,

48:49.860 --> 48:52.130
TRIED TO BRING LIGHT

48:52.230 --> 48:54.032
TO THOSE LOST
IN THE DARKNESS.

48:54.132 --> 48:56.234
IT'S THE STORY OF A MAN
NAMED BROTHER JUSTIN

48:56.334 --> 48:59.270
AND A TOWN
CALLED MINTERN...

48:59.370 --> 49:02.740
... and so,
six innocent children

49:02.840 --> 49:04.542
perished in
the flames of hate.

49:04.642 --> 49:06.911
This was no accidental fire,
my friends.

49:07.012 --> 49:09.214
Oh, no, this was
the work of evil men...

49:09.314 --> 49:11.116
The same evil men who dared
to block the good work

49:11.216 --> 49:12.917
of Brother Justin
because he dared to minister

49:13.018 --> 49:14.719
to the poor
and destitute.

49:14.819 --> 49:16.187
The city fathers
of Mintern

49:16.287 --> 49:18.189
called them Okies
and wanted them out.

49:18.289 --> 49:19.991
And when Justin
stood up to them,

49:20.091 --> 49:23.161
someone burned down
his church

49:23.261 --> 49:25.130
and murdered
his children.

49:25.230 --> 49:28.299
What kind of world
is this, friends ?

49:28.399 --> 49:30.201
What kind of world where
people burn down churches

49:30.301 --> 49:32.103
in the dead
of night ?

49:32.203 --> 49:33.838
And what of
Brother Justin ?

49:33.938 --> 49:35.440
Where is he ?

49:35.540 --> 49:37.242
When this reporter last saw him,
he was out there somewhere,

49:37.342 --> 49:40.045
walking alone,
looking for a sign

49:40.145 --> 49:42.147
from God that his work
was not in vain.

49:42.247 --> 49:45.683
Where are you,
Brother Justin ?

49:45.783 --> 49:50.388
WHERE ARE YOU ?

49:55.026 --> 49:56.561
WHERE ARE YOU ?

50:05.403 --> 50:06.604
HOW LONG ?

50:06.704 --> 50:08.406
20, 30 MAYBE.

50:08.506 --> 50:10.675
I'LL BE BACK.

50:10.775 --> 50:13.411
WHERE YOU GOING ?

50:24.689 --> 50:27.658
( wind whistling )

50:28.559 --> 50:31.329
( piano music )

50:38.736 --> 50:41.038
WHISKEY, PLEASE.

50:51.616 --> 50:53.884
HELL, I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU HERE.

50:53.984 --> 50:58.489
THIS ONE'S
ON THE HOUSE.

51:02.093 --> 51:04.795
I SURE APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU DID YESTERDAY.

51:04.895 --> 51:09.734
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN EASY GOING
AGAINST ALL YOUR FOLK LIKE THAT.

51:12.870 --> 51:16.174
I RESPECT A MAN
WHO LIVES BY A CODE.

51:18.976 --> 51:21.546
I AM GRATEFUL
LET ME TELL YOU.

51:21.646 --> 51:23.714
WELL, I KINDA THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE.

51:23.814 --> 51:26.351
THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU'D DO ME ONE IN RETURN.

51:26.451 --> 51:32.590
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HENRY SCUDDER ?

51:40.831 --> 51:43.468
STRANGE FELLOW
THAT ONE.

51:43.568 --> 51:46.504
CAME HERE TO WORK THE MINES,
BUT PEOPLE KNEW RIGHT OFF

51:46.604 --> 51:48.773
THERE WAS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM.

51:48.873 --> 51:52.710
THEN HE KILLED OLE' CARLTON
WITH A PICK-AXE,

51:52.810 --> 51:54.111
AND, THAT WAS IT.

51:54.212 --> 51:57.748
PEOPLE WERE MIGHTY UNHAPPY,
LET ME TELL YOU.

51:57.848 --> 52:03.087
NO LAW HERE OF COURSE,
SO THE MINERS THEY SET OUT

52:03.188 --> 52:05.623
TO TAKE MATTERS
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.

52:05.723 --> 52:08.359
THEY WERE GONNA
STRING SCUDDER UP.

52:08.459 --> 52:12.830
BUT HE WASN'T GONNA HAVE
NONE OF THAT, NO SIR.

52:12.930 --> 52:17.101
THAT'S WHEN
IT HAPPENED.

52:17.202 --> 52:19.904
CAVE-IN.

52:20.004 --> 52:24.008
WIPED OUT
THE WHOLE COMPANY.

52:24.108 --> 52:27.678
TERRIBLE THING.

52:27.778 --> 52:29.980
I WAS THERE,
I SAW IT.

52:30.080 --> 52:33.251
I SAW IT.

52:37.322 --> 52:39.924
AND THEN,
THE NEXT NIGHT...

52:40.024 --> 52:43.160
THEY CAME BACK.

52:43.261 --> 52:46.197
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

52:46.297 --> 52:47.632
EVERY ONE OF THEM,
THEY CAME BACK.

52:47.732 --> 52:54.272
AND THEY JUST
KEEP COMING BACK.

53:00.177 --> 53:03.581
SOUNDS CRAZY,
DON'T IT ?

53:03.681 --> 53:08.085
NOT THAT CRAZY.

53:08.185 --> 53:11.256
THANKS FOR
THE WHISKEY.

54:27.131 --> 54:29.300
LET'S GO.

54:29.400 --> 54:31.836
WE STILL
HEADING SOUTH ?

54:32.837 --> 54:35.272
YEP.

54:40.244 --> 54:42.313
FIGURED.
