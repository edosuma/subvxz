12:01.263 --> 12:05.347
- Injunction?
- This heap is considered art.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.766
Well, it’s gorgeous.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.764
Where does this leave
our investigation?

12:09.855 --> 12:14.064
You can still examine it.
You just can’t disrupt it in any way.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.937
Don’t worry.
This is only temporary.

12:16.028 --> 12:19.520
We’ll see how artistic people are feeling
when it starts stinking.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.526
Just don’t scratch it.

12:21.617 --> 12:25.155
Don’t scratch the crushed
automobile which encases
a rotting dead body?

12:25.245 --> 12:28.157
- Good. We understand each other.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.496
Geoffrey Thorne, dead?

12:33.587 --> 12:36.750
This is a great day
for the art world

12:36.840 --> 12:39.047
Yeah, well, last time
you were seen together,
you were arguing.

12:39.134 --> 12:43.047
- Well, we never saw each other
without arguing, so—
- You disliked Geoffrey Thorne?

12:43.138 --> 12:46.346
Well, let’sjust say
between his work and his guts,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.389
I don’t know which I hated more.

12:48.477 --> 12:51.844
Yeah, well, artistically speaking,
crushing him up in his own work—

12:51.939 --> 12:54.430
that would be very,
uh, symbolic.

12:54.524 --> 12:58.142
Is that what happened?
Oh, that-that’s hilarious.

12:58.236 --> 13:02.320
He crushed himself
Ins/de of one of his
stupid car sculptures?

13:02.407 --> 13:06.446
An exhibitionist
right to the bitter end.
How po-mo.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.318
“Po-mo”?
Uh, “postmodern.”

13:08.413 --> 13:10.870
L et me tell you.
Geoffrey’s hermetic aesthet/cism...

13:10.958 --> 13:12.869
was choked with tawdry pastiche.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.246
He had plastic intentions
and weak enterprise.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.999
All right.
Someone I understand less than you.

13:19.341 --> 13:22.959
This is asymmetrical and yet
still pleasing to the eye.

13:23.053 --> 13:26.341
Okay, I take that back.
Why don’t you just say
it’s... pretty?

13:26.473 --> 13:29.055
I don’t do pretty.
Okay.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.303
Simmer down there, Picasso.
You get a compliment, you be polite.

13:31.436 --> 13:34.052
I don’t do polite either.
Maybe that’s
why you’re broke.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.430
[ CarA/arm R/ng/ng]
Who gave you my name?

13:36.525 --> 13:38.857
Was it that Kabuki ghoul,
Helen Bridenbecker?

13:38.944 --> 13:40.980
Shouldn’t you be trying harder
to look innocent?

13:41.071 --> 13:43.062
Yeah. How long
have you and Thorne
hated each other?

13:43.156 --> 13:45.272
You can write down
“since before the big bang.”

13:45.367 --> 13:49.656
Oh, no. There was no “before”
before the big bang,
because time didn’t exist.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.123
/f there are no organ/'Z/ng

13:52.207 --> 13:54.539
Bones, I’m just gonna write down,
“It’s been a while.” All right?

13:54.626 --> 13:58.039
- So, why were you arguing at the gallery?
- We heard it was about money.

13:58.130 --> 14:01.418
Well, I might have said
he was a sellout.
I usually do.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.625
But I didn’t think to kill him.
Now it’s too late, right?

14:05.971 --> 14:08.337
Well, ifyou didn’t kill him,
then who did?

14:08.432 --> 14:10.514
Well, I’d look at his
girlfriend ifl were you.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.758
No one has mentioned
a girlfriend.
Roxie.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.969
His “assistant.”

14:15.063 --> 14:17.805
He said he was gonna leave
all his money to her.

14:17.899 --> 14:21.608
I mean, this is kind of
basic stuffyou guys
should know, right?

14:24.948 --> 14:28.611
Did you have, like, buckets
of coffee this morning?
You ’re ve/yshaky.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.693
Could you take
a step back, please?

14:33.999 --> 14:36.456
A little more.

You dumped a bucket
full ofdermestid beetles
onto this work ofart.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.990
- They’ll strip the flesh
off our victim in no time.
- Within 30 hours.

- Am I fired?
- Au contraire.

- Good work, Miss Wick.

Well, we could’ve
been here hours ago...

15:21.671 --> 15:23.707
if Dr. Saroyan
would have given me
the endoscope sooner.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.256
[Saroyan ]
Thanks for mentioning that.

15:26.343 --> 15:30.177
There’s too much ﬂesh
to really get an idea
ofthe bone damage.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.174
Thirty hours.

15:35.352 --> 15:39.391
I was Geoffrey Thorne’s assistant
for almost four years.

15:39.481 --> 15:42.348
Okay, I suggest you start
with the mundane and then
work yourself up—

15:42.442 --> 15:43.943
[On Earpiece]
to the sexual stuff.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.938
So, did you have a sexual
relationship with your boss?

15:46.029 --> 15:49.863
- Okay, that’s the total
opposite of my suggestion.
- No. No.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.191
So what was the nature
ofyour relationship?

15:52.285 --> 15:56.699
I assisted Geoffrey.
I handled the details
of his day—to—day life.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.948
Are you sure it’s Geoffrey?
Prevaricate.
Keep her guessing.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.624
- Yes. We’re positive.
- Why am I here?

16:01.711 --> 16:04.623
As his personal assistant,
did you get him his drugs?

16:04.714 --> 16:07.501
Ifyou mean
his prescriptions, then yes.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.550
I picked them up for him,
and I reminded him to take them.

16:10.637 --> 16:14.255
- Ask her ifThorne was clinically depressed.
- He was depressed, right?

16:14.349 --> 16:18.558
Yes. He was suicidal.
Seeing a shrink.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.387
That’s why you’re here.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.642
Because you think
Geoffrey took an overdose?

16:23.733 --> 16:26.861
Look, if he killed himself,
I mean, wouldn’t he have
left a suicide note?

16:26.945 --> 16:30.563
Yeah, I would think
that he would have
left me a message.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.774
Look, ifyou weren’t
sleeping with Thorne,

16:33.869 --> 16:38.283
then why did he name you
the sole beneficiary of his estate?

16:38.373 --> 16:39.954
Geoffrey’s will?

16:40.041 --> 16:43.909
Yeah. It’s— It’s about one million dollars.
Look at that.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.625
I had no idea
that he was gonna do that.

16:48.717 --> 16:51.504
Perhapsjealousy is her motive
for killing Thorne?

16:51.595 --> 16:53.460
Why else would she deny
sleeping with him?

16:53.597 --> 16:56.213
I don’t think so.
I swear.

16:56.308 --> 16:58.924
No, there was another reason
why you weren’t sleeping with Thorne.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.884
Isn’t that right, Roxie?

17:00.979 --> 17:02.890
Angela told you, didn’t she?

17:02.981 --> 17:05.848
- What? Told us what?
- Why don’t you tell me?

17:05.942 --> 17:08.900
I’m gay.
I’m a lesbian.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.979
I’ve never been
with a man in my life,
and I never will.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.109
Oh, that changes everything.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.657
[Brennan]
So according to his will,

17:20.749 --> 17:24.037
Roxie stands to inherit
Thorne’s entire estate.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.038
She said
they were close.

17:26.129 --> 17:29.337
Well, people usually
leave money like that
to a wife or a lover.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.957
IdonttMnkso
Because?

17:32.052 --> 17:35.169
Because Roxie’s an old friend,
and she’d have told me.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.387
Well, she says she’s a lesbian.
Delicacy, Bones.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.430
What? It’s not
an affliction, Booth.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.769
Yes, Roxie is gay.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.764
At least she was
when we were together.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.187
Where, in school?
Yes.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.683
Oh, you heard rumors?
No, I have
firsthand knowledge.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.689
Oh, you walked in on her.
That’s awkward.

17:51.780 --> 17:54.943
No, we were together...
for over a year.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.991
- Wow. You and Roxie—
- You have a problem with that?

17:58.078 --> 18:01.662
No! I wasjust processing
the information there. That’s all.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.366
And in doing so,
I was envisioning you and her,
you know, together, and—

18:05.460 --> 18:07.872
Well, not to—
Well, together, but— Really?

18:07.963 --> 18:11.501
Women tend not to be as rigid
in their sexual identities as men.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.172
Weren’t we talking
about murder here?

18:13.260 --> 18:15.296
Didshe evershow
any interest in men?

18:15.387 --> 18:18.254
No. And she would
never kill anybody.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.555
You haven’t been close
in a long time.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.099
- She hasn’t changed.
- Except that now she’s rich.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.097
Yeah, and before Thorne was killed,
she wasn’t rich.

18:25.188 --> 18:28.646
Roxie never cared about money.
I thought that you didn’t speculate?

18:28.733 --> 18:31.270
That doesn’t preclude pursuing
a logical line ofinquiry.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.226
We still don’t even know
that it was murder.

18:33.321 --> 18:36.484
Thorne wrote about
the need to become
one with his work.

18:36.574 --> 18:40.032
He was ill.
The logical signs point
to suicide, don’t they?

18:40.120 --> 18:42.611
Okay. You’re right, Ange. We’re sorry.
We didn’t mean to upset you.

18:42.706 --> 18:45.493
[Sighs]
I have work to do. Okay?

18:51.840 --> 18:54.297
Here’s the C2 axis.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.295
A little further.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.423
The C1 atlas.
We’re almost to the cranium.

18:59.514 --> 19:02.722
Nice. No w maybe you ’ll be able
to rescue the princess.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.016
[Laughs]
Thafsfunny.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.094
Everyone here is so nice.

19:07.188 --> 19:10.180
You know, I thinkI may
have initially come off
as a bit too needy.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.391
My family was pretty
dysfunctional,

19:12.485 --> 19:16.023
so I tend to want
a work environment
to fulfill certain needs.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.526
Perhaps some therapy
might help.

19:18.616 --> 19:22.108
What a thoughtful suggestion.
I always wanted a sister.

19:22.203 --> 19:27.493
Dr. Brennan, Miss Wick and I
werejust observing
the handiwork ofyour beetles.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.870
They did a beautiful job
ofcleaning the bones.

19:29.961 --> 19:32.623
But half the remains are still
obscured by the metal.

19:32.714 --> 19:37.174
- The victim’s right iliac crest
shows a simple fracture.
- I also found micro fractures...

19:37.260 --> 19:40.047
extending from his right ribs,
five through 10, down
his right greater trochanter.

19:40.138 --> 19:43.676
- Very good.
- Really? And they were really small.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.850
Micro fractures are
by definition small.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.972
What does this damage indicate?

19:49.064 --> 19:53.103
A test. Okay.
The damage is inconclusive.

19:53.193 --> 19:56.435
Um, the fractures could
easily be explained by
the crushing of the car.

19:56.529 --> 20:00.613
- But some could be the result
ofan attack or a fall.
- I agree.

She agrees.

and magnesium oxide.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.082
Now, it wasn’t found
on the car seats or the carpet.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.626
Just pressed into
the fabric ofhis shirt—
front and back.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.955
- From what?
- Could be from stone
if he was sculpting,

20:17.050 --> 20:20.008
if he was lying on gravel
or about a hundred other things.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.087
I can’t say without
getting further access
to the interior ofthe car.

20:23.181 --> 20:27.766
Which access you were
expressly denied
by a federaljudge.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.810

who turned red
and then blue,

20:30.897 --> 20:33.855

specifically forbidden

law” means anything to you?
- [Computer Whirs]

20:45.578 --> 20:48.945
That little Kabuki lady
started screaming like you
peedon the Mona Lisa...

20:49.040 --> 20:51.827
that you compromised
the integrity ofthe piece.

20:51.918 --> 20:55.081
That little stunt
turned good opinion
from thejudge against us.

20:55.171 --> 20:58.083
- How long have we got?
- Two days to find
evidence of foul play.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.506
- And after that?
- The question goes to the court,

21:00.593 --> 21:04.131
and we grow old and die
before a decision is made.

21:04.222 --> 21:08.010
And ifthere is a murderer,
that murderer walks around free.
Ideas?

21:09.227 --> 21:12.094
I will think about it
until my head explodes.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.019
This one’s a keeper.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.606

part ofhis studio.

21:23.658 --> 21:25.990

- What does Helen say?

21:26.119 --> 21:29.031
We’re talking about
an exhibition.
That’sgreat.

21:29.122 --> 21:32.285
- When was your last show?
- Eight years ago,
when we were together.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.831
[Chuckles]

21:33.918 --> 21:37.661
I don’t know. Is it too sappy to say
that you were my muse?

21:37.755 --> 21:42.249
Or perhaps my entire
source of self-confidence
as an artist?

21:45.472 --> 21:48.054
Your people think
I killed Geoffrey.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.429
I can’t talk to you
about an ongoing
murder investigation.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.430
Ifyou can’t prove
it was a suicide,

21:53.521 --> 21:56.809
I’m gonna spend
the rest of my life being
Geoffrey Thorne’s murderer.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.733

ofyour work, right?

the first piece that caught Helen ’5 eye.

22:15.376 --> 22:17.367
She wanted to buy it
from me for herself.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.874
Why didn’t you sell this?

22:19.964 --> 22:22.376
Some things aren’t for sale.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.505
I remember sitting for this.

22:30.642 --> 22:33.384
Yeah.
Happiest time of my life.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.558
Oh, my God.

22:37.649 --> 22:41.767
Oh, my God.
I have to go.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.522
Why?

22:43.613 --> 22:46.946

that Geoffrey Thorne
committed suicide.

- Every crease and fold, yeah.
- We have less than 40 hours, you know.

We don’t need a countdown.

[A nge/a ]
Then I’ll recalibrate...

23:15.895 --> 23:18.728
and get a digital rendering
of the bones inside,
which /can enhance.

23:18.815 --> 23:22.933
You found out how to show
what bone damage came from
the actual crushing ofthe car.

23:23.027 --> 23:26.645
Factoring in the pounds
per square inch of force
exerted by the car crusher.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.730
Oh, I hope you’ve included
the car’s frame...

23:28.825 --> 23:31.567
and the tensile strength
ofthe victim’s skeletal structure.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.652
I’ll make a note.

23:34.998 --> 23:38.115
Well, I programmed my phone
to get the five-day forecast.

23:41.129 --> 23:43.745
Okay, take a look at this.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.922
Here we have our car, right?

23:46.009 --> 23:48.250
It had a low-carbon
steel frame...

23:48.344 --> 23:51.836
with a yield strength
of22,450 P.S.l.

23:51.931 --> 23:56.641
So, since / know
the hydraulic crusher
imparts I 63 tons of force—

23:56.728 --> 24:00.095
first horizontal/y,
then at a 32-degree
curling motion—

24:00.189 --> 24:04.102
I was able to verify the source
of every single ripple on
the surface ofthe crushed car.

24:04.193 --> 24:07.151
Which then gave me the data
to play the crushing backwards.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.990
- How’d you do that?
- Well, Daisy provided me...

24:13.077 --> 24:15.944
with the approximate
tensile strength of each
of Geoffrey’s bones.

24:16.039 --> 24:19.531
Plugged in the bone fragments’
final positions, and, based on those,

24:19.626 --> 24:23.665
correlated each injury
as the body was moved through
the car as it was crushed.

/ really hope
that guy didn ’t kno w
what was happening to him.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.379
His bones sustained
88 fractures,

24:30.470 --> 24:33.177
all ofwhich can be explained
by the crushing in the car.

Oh, no.

24:46.069 --> 24:49.436
What?
There’s an 89th fracture.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.691
The fracture there
on his occipital—

24:51.783 --> 24:55.696
- It was not caused by
the car being crushed.
- What caused it?

24:55.787 --> 24:58.745
I need to examine the skull.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.289
It wasn’t supposed
to be this way.

25:02.377 --> 25:05.460
- I wanted to prove it wasn’t murder.
- But it is.

25:05.546 --> 25:09.585
The 89th fracture proves
that Geoffrey Thorne
was murdered

25:16.474 --> 25:18.965

It was a million-dollar

That changed it from a work

This is crazy.
I don’t understand.

it would be murder.

people say the exact opposite
ofwhat they mean.

30:21.028 --> 30:24.270
I do still have
feelings for her.

Are you saying the opposite
of what you mean now or before?

- Oh.
- I don’t really think that
I have the right...

30:50.099 --> 30:54.934
to open up that can of worms
again just because some feelings
are rising to the surface.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.558
It’s too bad there isn’t a way
to experiment with sexuality.

30:57.648 --> 31:00.765

into this whole mess
in the first place.

31:00.860 --> 31:04.193
- Well, I meant—
- I know what you meant. I’m just—

31:04.280 --> 31:07.568
Well, on the bright side,
ifshe did kill Geoffrey Thorne,

about any ofthat.

I’ve seen this injury many times.

that the death blow came
from a common fire ax.

31:31.432 --> 31:35.425
There’s also limestone
and silicon oxide on his clothes.

Sure. Here. So what
do we know about that?

to identify the bleeder.

- [ Both] Whoa!
- [ Booth] Gee!

32:24.276 --> 32:27.484
Hey, Bones, you know
you almost lit my butt on fire?

32:27.571 --> 32:31.189
Well, notice the flames leapt
from the center ofthe room
toward the loading dock.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.446

that Thorne was killed here
and then dragged there.

32:34.537 --> 32:37.370

over here, please?

32:38.541 --> 32:41.954

I gotta tell you.
That was a great trick
there, Bones.

32:45.172 --> 32:48.539
Yeah. Remove the turpentine,
reveal the blood
soaked into the concrete.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.717
The bloodstains show up
approximately every 35 centimeters.

32:51.804 --> 32:54.045

That would explain
why Hodgins found..

32:54.140 --> 32:56.722
the cement particles
on the front and the back
ofthe clothing.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.720
Yeah, but why rolled
instead ofdragged?

32:58.811 --> 33:01.223
Thorne was a big guy.
Okay, whoe ver killed him...

33:01.313 --> 33:04.851

car/y him to the loading dock
and put him in the car.

33:04.942 --> 33:08.184

33:25.212 --> 33:29.171

- Geoffrey’s work was selling.

33:42.104 --> 33:44.937

situation as the last time
we were sitting here.

33:45.024 --> 33:47.106
Except, you know,
you’re quieter.

33:47.193 --> 33:50.731
No, that was about Hodgins.
This is about Roxie.

33:50.863 --> 33:54.196
You want to have sex with Roxie?
What was that about quieter?

33:54.283 --> 33:58.572
I’m sorry. I’m not certain
that you’re being guided
by your brain. That’s all.

33:58.662 --> 34:02.701
Need can be confused with love.
Fantasy can convince us that
what we’re feeling is love.

34:02.833 --> 34:05.449
So you’re saying that this
is all a rebound?
Yeah.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.660
No. You don’t
understand love, Sweets.

34:07.755 --> 34:09.837
I’m not as innocent
as you might think.

34:09.965 --> 34:13.048
You have this
bourgeois notion—
“Bourgeois.”

34:13.135 --> 34:16.047
That in order
for love to be real,
it has to be permanent.

34:16.138 --> 34:19.096
Nothing is permanent.
That’sjust a fact.

34:19.183 --> 34:21.094
We move in and out
of loving other people,

34:21.185 --> 34:23.392
but that doesn’t make
the love any less real.

34:23.479 --> 34:26.312
Mm-hmm. Perhaps you’re saying
this because you’ve never met
the love ofyour life.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.185
I have, actually—
many times.

34:29.276 --> 34:31.358
Fine. It seems to me...

34:31.445 --> 34:33.811
that you always leave yourself
an escape hatch...

34:33.906 --> 34:37.364
in your relationships
because you’re afraid
of commitment.

34:38.452 --> 34:40.363
Nice try, but no.

34:40.454 --> 34:42.945
Actually, I commit
to every person I love.

34:43.040 --> 34:46.077
You marry a man,
and then conveniently forget
that you married him...

34:46.168 --> 34:48.159
because you got zonked
on kava kava?

34:48.254 --> 34:51.041
That compromises your relationship
with Hodgins, so that ends,

34:51.131 --> 34:52.667
along with the marriage.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.669
Now you say you have these
intense feelings...

34:54.760 --> 34:57.593
for an ex-lover whose heart
you’ve already broken.

35:00.724 --> 35:04.182
Look, you said that without
the possibility of pain,

35:04.270 --> 35:07.387
there can be nojoy,
no real love.

35:07.481 --> 35:10.689
I said that?
That’s beautiful.

35:11.694 --> 35:14.527
Look. I don’t want
to hurt Roxie again.

35:14.613 --> 35:17.696
Then don’t. Don’t.
Put her welfare first.

35:17.783 --> 35:21.401
Let Roxie decide
ifshe’s ready to pursue
this relationship.

35:21.495 --> 35:24.111
Okay.

35:24.206 --> 35:26.197
And what ifshe doesn’t?

35:27.835 --> 35:30.747
Then I’m afraid you’ll have
to live with that pain.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.084
I used a mass spectrometer
during my summer internship
atJohns Hopkins.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.089
I even taught my friend
how to use it.

35:40.180 --> 35:43.388
Excellent. Next you should learn
the concept of personal space.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.386
What’d you get off the ax?

35:45.477 --> 35:48.389
/t was Wiped clean
with turpentine.
No signs of blood

35:48.522 --> 35:51.389
And he also checked the handle.
Sodium chloride and odorants.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.394
Sweat— Most likely human.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.646
- What was the eccrine pH?
- Seven.

35:55.738 --> 35:57.899
It was a woman!
What you should
have him do next...

35:57.990 --> 36:01.482
is match the DNA. from the sweat
to Angela’s lesbian lover.

36:01.618 --> 36:04.701
See ifthere’s a match.
Do you ever listen
to yourself?

36:04.788 --> 36:07.996
Yeah. But it’s
a good idea, Hodgins.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.460
You might wanna prepare Angela.

36:22.222 --> 36:24.087
[Sighs]

36:24.224 --> 36:27.512
Dr. Saroyan.
Thank you so much for seeing me.

36:27.603 --> 36:29.514
I didn’t agree to see you.

36:29.605 --> 36:33.063
How come none ofyou people
ever book an appointment?
Frankly, it’s annoying.

36:33.150 --> 36:36.483
Ah. Annoying.
That’s exactly why I’m here. I—

36:36.570 --> 36:38.526
[Sighs]

36:38.614 --> 36:41.481
I’ve done an unofficial,
confidential survey
of my people, and—

36:41.575 --> 36:45.568
And they find me annoying.
No, it’s worse. They hate me.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.948
You know why, don’t you?
It’s ’cause Dr. Brennan...

36:48.040 --> 36:50.702
undervalues psychology,
and all ofyou have picked up her vibe.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.496
I know that sounds paranoid—
And the word “vibe”
is a little dated.

36:53.629 --> 36:57.213
But it’s true.
N— I’m not here
about you being annoying.

36:57.341 --> 36:59.252
It’s Daisy Wick.
Daisy?

36:59.343 --> 37:01.880
Yes. She’s very smart,
very able,

37:01.970 --> 37:04.757
and she has a knack
for turning reasonable people...

37:04.848 --> 37:08.090
into flaming gas balls offury.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.889
You want me to talk to her?
No, no.
I need your advice...

37:10.979 --> 37:13.265
on how to tell Daisy
we can’t have her
at the lab anymore.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.685
Oh.
I’m very comfortable
with incompetence.

37:15.818 --> 37:18.981
But when it’sjust
a matter of personality—
I’ll do it.

37:19.113 --> 37:20.899
What? Really?
Yeah, I’ll talk to her.

37:20.989 --> 37:24.823
Well, as the boss,
it’s kind of myjob
to fire people.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.492
And as a boss,
you know that sometimes
it’s better to delegate.

37:27.579 --> 37:31.413
I’ll do it. Let’sjust hope
she doesn’t turn me into
a flaming gas ball offury.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.491
[Chuckles]

37:33.585 --> 37:36.577
Well, I’m no psychologist,
but I think you should be flattered...

37:36.672 --> 37:39.539
that we all drop in on you
and ask your advice.

37:39.633 --> 37:41.169
Thank you.

37:46.557 --> 37:49.640
Okay. Ready for you
to blow up my mind.

37:49.726 --> 37:52.058
Okay. Now, first off,
I almost missed this,

37:52.187 --> 37:54.849
so don’t praise me too much.
Point is,
you didn’t miss it.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.272
Yeah, but only because
Angela asked for
a personal favor,

37:57.359 --> 37:59.395
and I am powerless
to resist.

37:59.486 --> 38:02.193
Okay. Now, this is
the victim’s clothing.

38:02.281 --> 38:06.320
And this is the ax handle
ofthe presumed murder weapon.

38:06.410 --> 38:09.823
As you know, there were traces
of sweat on both ofthem,
but not the victim’s sweat.

38:09.955 --> 38:13.539
Female sweat, yes.
Presumably, the murderer
sweat on the ax handle,

38:13.625 --> 38:16.458
then perspired while
rolling the victim’s body to the car.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.456
Yes. Now, upon further analysis,

38:18.547 --> 38:21.163
I discovered other traces
in the sweat.

38:21.258 --> 38:26.378
Imatinib mesylate,
hydroxyurea, busulfan?

38:26.472 --> 38:29.009
Do you have any idea
where these chemicals
might’ve come from?

38:29.141 --> 38:31.507
Medicines.
Treatments for cancer.
I looked them up.

38:31.602 --> 38:34.218
This is treatment for chronic
myelogenous leukemia.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.429
Then Roxie is not our murderer.

38:36.523 --> 38:40.482
You can’t necessarily tell
if someone has leukemia
from looking at them.

38:40.569 --> 38:42.730
No, but this drug here,
busulfan—

38:42.821 --> 38:45.062
It causes highly visible
skin discoloration.

38:45.157 --> 38:49.070
Oh, then that is
very good for Angela.

38:49.161 --> 38:51.573
Not that we are swayed
by those considerations.

38:56.919 --> 38:58.910
What’s that look?

38:59.004 --> 39:00.995
She knows who did it.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.373
I had no reason
to kill Geoffrey.

39:04.468 --> 39:06.379
You own several
of his art pieces.

39:06.470 --> 39:09.507
We all know that art increases in value
when an artist dies.

39:09.598 --> 39:13.682
[Scoffs ] Anyone could see
that Geoffrey Thorne wasn’t
long for this world.

39:13.769 --> 39:17.557
- I’m a very patient woman.
- Except you’re dying,
Miss Bridenbecker.

39:17.648 --> 39:20.981
- Nonsense.
- Would you please
remove your makeup?

39:21.068 --> 39:22.979
I will not.
I want a lawyer.

39:23.070 --> 39:25.652
Really? Because, you know,
the phone records, they indicate...

39:25.739 --> 39:28.697
that you contacted
a cancer clinic in Mexico City.

39:28.784 --> 39:32.242
And we do know that that clinic
costs a small fortune.

39:32.329 --> 39:34.445
Ifit’s any consolation,
it wouldn’t have worked.

39:34.581 --> 39:38.415
Their trea tmen t—
it’s not legit/ma te.
You don’t know that.

39:39.628 --> 39:42.119
I’m afraid I do.
Places like that are set up...

39:42.214 --> 39:45.251
to prey on the hopes
of people like you.

39:46.385 --> 39:49.377
Geoffrey was
going to die anyway.

39:49.471 --> 39:52.178
Anyone could see that.

39:52.266 --> 39:54.302
Idid him a favor.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.476
I gave him his start.

40:00.107 --> 40:02.439
Geoffrey would much rather
have been remembered...

40:02.526 --> 40:05.518
as a fully committed artist
than as some common
murder victim.

40:05.612 --> 40:08.649
ReaHy?
Maybe he preferred to live.

40:09.992 --> 40:11.903
Well—

40:11.994 --> 40:14.827
Well, so would I.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.871
I guess none of us
get what we want.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.674
Hey, Roxie.

40:35.017 --> 40:37.099
Now what do I do?

40:37.185 --> 40:40.894
Well, you have money.
And you have a studio.

40:40.981 --> 40:44.189
I think what you should do
is your own art full time.

40:44.276 --> 40:46.187
That’s not what I mean.

40:49.531 --> 40:52.694
Did you ever,
even for a second,
think that it was me?

40:54.911 --> 40:57.903
No. Not fora second.

40:57.998 --> 40:59.488
Why?

40:59.583 --> 41:01.494
Because we—

41:01.585 --> 41:04.827
We really knew each other once,
and I don’t think that...

41:04.921 --> 41:07.128
you’ve changed much
since then.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.171
Have you changed?

41:11.094 --> 41:13.301
Uh, I don’t—
I don’t know, Roxie.

41:13.388 --> 41:16.004
I’m— Maybe I have,
but I’m not—

41:16.099 --> 41:18.090
I— I haven’t changed—

41:27.235 --> 41:30.147
[ Computer Beep/ng]
[Saroyan ] How do you think
he ’s gonna do it?

41:30.238 --> 41:33.196
He’ll convince her
that it’s best for her
to move to anotherjob.

41:34.868 --> 41:37.780
What’s going on?
Sweets is firing
Daisy for us.

41:37.871 --> 41:40.453
We were wondering
what his method will be.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.531
Well, he’ll explain to her logically...

41:42.626 --> 41:46.118
- that this environment is not
conducive for either her or us,
- [ Bee pi n g ]

41:46.213 --> 41:49.250
and as a scientist,
she ’l/ realize that he ’5 right.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.332
No. Sweets is a lot
sneakier than that.

41:51.426 --> 41:54.293
He’ll use some kind of
psychological Jedi mind trick...

41:54.388 --> 41:57.004
to make her think it was
her idea to quit.

41:57.099 --> 41:59.556
I’ve got some good news
and some bad news.

41:59.685 --> 42:02.973
Which would you like first?
The bad news.

42:03.063 --> 42:05.600
You’re toast here.
Nobody wants to work with you.

42:05.691 --> 42:07.602
Why?

42:07.693 --> 42:10.560
You know why, Daisy.
There’s some things that
you have to work on...

42:10.654 --> 42:12.519
when it comes to
interpersonal relations.

42:12.656 --> 42:14.738
Does anybody like me?
No, I’m afraid not.

42:15.951 --> 42:18.317
What’s the good news?

42:18.412 --> 42:21.825
There’s absolutely no reason
for us to be discreet about
our relationship anymore.

42:21.957 --> 42:25.040
ReaHy?
Yeah. Why would you
ask me that?

42:25.127 --> 42:28.790
Because I thought we were being
discreet ’cause you were
a little bit ashamed of me.

42:39.975 --> 42:42.432

I’m totally shocked.

42:42.519 --> 42:46.432
Yeah. They should not be doing that
on the forensic platform.

42:46.523 --> 42:49.765
That’s a method oftermination
I’ve never tried.

42:49.860 --> 42:52.693
- But bravo, Dr. Sweets.
- Whoa.

42:52.821 --> 42:55.858
That’ll never work.
They’re like complete opposites.
I agree.

42:55.949 --> 42:59.157
[Brennan]
For all her faults,
she’s a woman of science.

42:59.244 --> 43:03.658
Sweets bases his life
on the vagaries of
psychology and emotion.

43:03.790 --> 43:05.496
There’s no common ground
