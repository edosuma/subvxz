WEBVTT

00:07.624 --> 00:09.191
Did you miss me, Gal?

00:09.192 --> 00:12.660
Madalena, I have traveled
1,000 miles to see you.

00:12.662 --> 00:14.396
I fought pirates.

00:14.397 --> 00:16.797
I stared death in the face a dozen times,

00:16.799 --> 00:18.667
and I did all that to be with a woman

00:18.668 --> 00:21.970
who chose a fierce and cruel man
over my unconditional love.

00:21.971 --> 00:24.070
- So...
- You crossed my mind, yes.

00:24.841 --> 00:26.809
Then why didn't you act happy to see me?

00:26.810 --> 00:28.544
To be honest, I don't know how to feel.

00:28.545 --> 00:30.511
Isabella told me
you wanted me to rescue you.

00:30.513 --> 00:31.914
Did you even know I was coming?

00:31.915 --> 00:34.650
Well, I found out earlier today,
and as soon as I did,

00:34.651 --> 00:36.685
I made a plan for us to be together.

00:36.686 --> 00:38.821
Yeah, well, <i>I</i> had a plan, as well.

00:38.822 --> 00:41.490
We were gonna live
in a cottage by the sea.

00:41.491 --> 00:44.193
We were gonna make love, plant a garden...

00:44.194 --> 00:45.294
Have children.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.796
I was gonna sing songs of your beauty.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.364
Oh, Gal.

00:49.365 --> 00:50.599
That sounds awful.

00:51.501 --> 00:53.135
Look around.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.937
I live in a castle.

00:54.938 --> 00:56.905
And you know
what I've learned about myself?

00:56.906 --> 00:59.708
I really like stuff.

00:59.709 --> 01:02.110
I mean, why would I give all this up

01:02.111 --> 01:04.413
to get fat and pregnant
and grow my own food?

01:04.414 --> 01:06.348
So, you didn't want me to come?

01:08.718 --> 01:11.887
I should never have trusted Isabella.

01:11.888 --> 01:14.022
How could someone so small
tell such a big lie?

01:14.023 --> 01:15.524
Well, none of that matters now.

01:15.525 --> 01:17.993
I have a plan that will allow me
to remain as queen,

01:17.994 --> 01:21.963
and you will be
well taken care of as my...

01:21.964 --> 01:23.098
Special companion.

01:23.099 --> 01:24.933
Your boy toy, you mean.

01:24.934 --> 01:27.436
Is that how you see me? Hmm?

01:27.437 --> 01:29.671
As some well-groomed, ruggedly handsome,

01:29.672 --> 01:31.706
yet oddly delicate-featured plaything?

01:32.942 --> 01:34.009
Yeah.

01:35.044 --> 01:37.546
Madalena, I've got something to say,

01:37.547 --> 01:40.782
and I've come a really,
<i>really</i> long way to say it.

01:40.783 --> 01:42.117

Does that clear things up for you?

03:05.033 --> 03:06.334
No.

03:06.335 --> 03:08.035
And when did you learn how to dance?

03:08.036 --> 03:10.872
Galavant - 01x06
Dungeons and Dragon Lady

03:11.345 --> 03:13.218
Are you hearing this, Gareth?

03:13.220 --> 03:17.425
My own wife tries to trick me
into killing my favorite chef

03:17.425 --> 03:19.292
so she can save her ex-boyfriend.

03:19.293 --> 03:20.260
You sure it was her?

03:20.261 --> 03:21.428
Pretty girl, tiny waist, big eyes?

03:21.429 --> 03:22.562
Definitely, My King.

03:23.731 --> 03:25.699
No one has it as bad as I do, Gareth.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.634
- No one!
- Aaaaaaaah!

03:29.370 --> 03:31.104
Uh... Don't worry.

03:31.105 --> 03:34.240
Why do I continually allow
people to treat me this way?

03:34.241 --> 03:35.041
Oh, come on.

03:35.042 --> 03:37.477
Forget I'm your king
and talk to me like your friend.

03:37.478 --> 03:38.511
All right.

03:38.512 --> 03:40.013
You keep acting like a prat.

03:40.014 --> 03:41.448
You need to be more of a geezer.

03:41.449 --> 03:44.684
You know, I've tried to tell you
time and time again.

03:44.685 --> 03:46.920
You don't turn your ear.

03:48.089 --> 03:49.155
Oh, Gareth.

03:49.156 --> 03:50.690
I can't understand a word you say.

03:50.691 --> 03:52.826
Let me ask you this, then.

03:52.827 --> 03:54.727
Do you like me, Gareth?

03:54.728 --> 03:58.731
- I mean, you know, as a... as a person?
- Aaaaaaah!

04:01.368 --> 04:02.535
I got to go.

04:02.536 --> 04:03.670
My queen needs me.

04:03.671 --> 04:05.471
- <i>Your</i> queen?
- Mm.

04:05.472 --> 04:08.141
Are you hearing this? Now it's <i> his</i> queen.

04:08.142 --> 04:09.876
Fine. Go ahead.

04:09.877 --> 04:11.644
Leave me, too. Be that guy.

04:11.645 --> 04:12.512
Go. Go.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.746
Yeah, okay.

04:16.016 --> 04:17.784
Why am I like this?

04:17.785 --> 04:20.623
Why do I continually allow
people to treat me this way?

04:20.625 --> 04:22.024
- Sire!
- Hmm?

04:22.027 --> 04:24.457
I-I think I know something
that may help you.

04:24.458 --> 04:26.025
Really? What?

04:26.026 --> 04:28.027
Have you ever heard of Xanax?

04:28.028 --> 04:29.162
Xanax?

04:29.163 --> 04:31.764
Is he that new magician
I'm hearing so much about?

04:31.765 --> 04:32.899
Merlin's replacement?

04:32.900 --> 04:33.966
Yes, My King.

04:33.967 --> 04:36.669
I-I occasionally buy herbs from him.

04:36.670 --> 04:39.305
Herbs? For what? F-f-for cooking?

04:40.307 --> 04:41.507
Yeah... f-for cooking.

04:42.676 --> 04:45.578
All right, it's worth a shot.
Let's go see Xanax.

04:45.579 --> 04:47.647
I should probably put on
something more casual.

04:47.648 --> 04:49.048
The brown.

04:53.887 --> 04:55.555
Uh, hi.

04:55.556 --> 04:57.523
Um, why are we back in the dungeon?

04:57.524 --> 05:00.026
Just wait here. I'll come
get you when it's time.

05:00.027 --> 05:02.161
Someone's coming to help execute my plan.

05:02.162 --> 05:03.329
Move along.

05:05.265 --> 05:06.999
Galavant! Galavant!

05:09.436 --> 05:11.270
I thought you were dead.

05:11.271 --> 05:13.206
You mean because you betrayed me,
you thought they would hang me?

05:13.207 --> 05:14.273
Because you <i> betrayed</i> me?

05:14.274 --> 05:15.441
Oh, trust me, sir,

05:15.442 --> 05:17.910
I have been guilting
the crap out of her down here.

05:17.911 --> 05:19.979
King Richard said if I didn't
deliver the jewel <i> and</i> you,

05:19.980 --> 05:21.347
he would kill my parents.

05:21.348 --> 05:22.982
I tried to warn you...

05:22.983 --> 05:25.151
so many songs, so many asides.

05:25.152 --> 05:26.919
The point is, Queen Madalena,

05:26.920 --> 05:28.688
you have the jewel and you have Galavant.

05:28.689 --> 05:30.790
- You must release my parents.
- Must I?

05:30.791 --> 05:32.325
- Yes. You have to.
- Have I?

05:32.326 --> 05:33.559
- Yes.
- Really?

05:33.560 --> 05:34.860
Why are you just repeating
everything I say as a question?

05:34.861 --> 05:36.662
Am I just repeating everything
you say as a question?

05:36.663 --> 05:38.097
You... Don't hear it?

05:38.098 --> 05:39.432
-<i>I</i> hear it. Yeah. 
- Yeah.

05:39.433 --> 05:42.968
- You're sort of doing it a little bit.
- I had a deal with King Richard.

05:42.969 --> 05:44.937
My dear girl...

05:44.938 --> 05:46.739
I am not King Richard.

05:46.740 --> 05:51.243
But I will enjoy killing the girl
who tried to eat my leftover man mutton.

05:55.949 --> 05:58.984
Is... Anyone else uncomfortable?

06:01.121 --> 06:02.421
Gareth.

06:02.422 --> 06:04.127
Cut her face.

06:04.129 --> 06:05.396
Torture the rest.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.800
- Gala...
- Excuse me?

06:07.802 --> 06:11.026
I said torture them. Is there a problem?

06:11.231 --> 06:12.632
No. There's not a problem.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.567
I <i> like</i> torturing. I'm pretty good at it.

06:14.568 --> 06:16.102
I once kept a guy alive for a week,

06:16.103 --> 06:18.270
and he was just a head and a finger.

06:18.271 --> 06:20.139
But that order came from the king,

06:20.140 --> 06:21.240
and I serve My King.

06:21.241 --> 06:24.176
Your king is weak, Gareth. You know this.

06:24.177 --> 06:26.879
He cries like a baby,
he cares like a woman.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.081
He makes decoupage footstools as a hobby.

06:29.082 --> 06:30.483
Hey! That was a birthday present.

06:30.484 --> 06:32.084
He got me that so I could have a sit down.

06:32.085 --> 06:34.420
You're a dog, Gareth.

06:34.421 --> 06:36.789
And a dog needs a strong master.

06:38.024 --> 06:39.758
Now sic 'em.

06:44.331 --> 06:46.165
Here we are, sir.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.500
Are we safe?

06:47.501 --> 06:49.869
This neighborhood looks a little dodgy.

06:49.870 --> 06:51.170
Don't worry, sire, we'll be fine.

06:51.171 --> 06:53.305
Just... Try not to look scared.

06:54.574 --> 06:56.842
Hello. Nice to see you.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:05.318 --> 07:06.852
What do you want?

07:08.822 --> 07:10.656
Uh, we're here to see Xanax.

07:10.657 --> 07:12.224
He's in the attic.

07:12.225 --> 07:13.992
Mom! It's a laboratory!

07:13.993 --> 07:15.260
Call it a laboratory.

07:15.261 --> 07:16.395
It's an attic.

07:22.469 --> 07:25.938
Hmm. This is... Cozy.

07:25.939 --> 07:29.441
King Richard, may I present
Xanax The Magician.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.678
Actually, I'm not legally allowed

07:32.679 --> 07:34.680
to call myself a magician anymore

07:34.681 --> 07:37.015
'cause of the whole...  Thing.

07:37.016 --> 07:38.450
Don't worry.

07:38.451 --> 07:40.886
Think of me as a spiritual guide.

07:40.887 --> 07:42.754
I'm allowed to... Call myself that.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.223
<i>Anyone</i> can. It's meaningless.

07:46.459 --> 07:48.460
Look at his shiny little hat, toad.

07:48.461 --> 07:50.262
Ribbit.

07:50.263 --> 07:51.563
Who's that person?

07:51.564 --> 07:53.265
It's toad. He's cool.

07:53.266 --> 07:54.199
Ribbit.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.068
Don't ask.

07:57.036 --> 07:58.603
He <i> was</i> a toad.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.172
I did a spell...

08:00.173 --> 08:03.809
turned him into a human-ish... Type thing.

08:03.810 --> 08:05.243
So, uh, yeah. I flipped it.

08:06.279 --> 08:07.846
That's very good.

08:07.847 --> 08:09.448
Anyway, what can I do for you gents?

08:09.449 --> 08:11.550
Well, it's... No big deal, really.

08:11.551 --> 08:13.452
We were just... in the neighborhood,

08:13.453 --> 08:15.320
and, um, I was sort of wondering,

08:15.321 --> 08:17.289
you know, why I am the way I am,

08:17.290 --> 08:19.925
and he mentioned
you might be able to help me.

08:19.926 --> 08:22.093
Xanax can help <i> anything.</i>

08:22.094 --> 08:23.094
Wonderful.

08:25.064 --> 08:26.731
Bit of wind there.

08:26.732 --> 08:28.033
Ooh.

08:28.034 --> 08:29.901
Right. Let's get you started.

08:29.902 --> 08:32.437
This is a... Kind of disgusting
little workstation, isn't it?

08:32.438 --> 08:35.106
You see the toilet?
It's basically a window.

08:35.107 --> 08:39.144
And by "window,"
I mean "hole"... in the wall.

08:39.145 --> 08:40.412
It works.

08:40.413 --> 08:41.546
One of them.

08:41.547 --> 08:43.280
Oh. Toad spotted it.
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

08:44.984 --> 08:46.217
That goes in.

08:46.218 --> 08:48.320
Ready. Let's do this.

08:49.655 --> 08:50.989
Oooooooooooh.

08:52.525 --> 08:54.793
Now the magic words.

08:56.328 --> 08:59.130
Abracadabra.

08:59.131 --> 09:01.433
Alakazam.

09:01.434 --> 09:07.372
Habrazamdabra, flanimal ham.

09:07.373 --> 09:08.473
Oooooh.

09:08.474 --> 09:10.809
Try that now. It's all magic.

09:10.810 --> 09:13.711
- So, I just... Drink that down, eh?
- Yeah.

09:13.712 --> 09:16.180
- Straight down the gullet?
- Yeah.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.317
- Ooh. That is pungent.
- Yeah. That's the anus.

09:19.318 --> 09:21.719
Oh, what the hell.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.787
Oh, God.

09:22.788 --> 09:23.788
Mm.

09:23.789 --> 09:25.056
Hmm.

09:25.057 --> 09:28.426
Takes a little while to kick in
with a strong-willed...

09:28.427 --> 09:29.460
- I'm feeling it.
- Yeah.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.997
Oh, wow.

09:38.915 --> 09:42.351
All right, boss, we need an escape plan.

09:42.352 --> 09:44.720
- What are you thinking?
- Here's what I think.

09:46.323 --> 09:49.191
If you really break it down...

09:49.192 --> 09:51.827
"I love you as much as someone
like me could love anyone"

09:51.828 --> 09:53.028
can mean a lot of things.

09:53.029 --> 09:55.029
Oh, come on, man.

09:55.031 --> 09:56.665
Oh, just let it go!

09:56.666 --> 09:58.066
She's the worst!

09:58.067 --> 10:00.335
- She imprisoned us.
- She stole our jewels.

10:00.335 --> 10:02.670
- Yeah, not a fan.
- You want to know what I think?

10:02.672 --> 10:03.972
I think you're in a dungeon

10:03.973 --> 10:06.174
wondering if the woman
that put you there loves you.

10:06.175 --> 10:09.344
And the real question is,
why do you still love her?

10:09.345 --> 10:11.046
I mean, yes, she's beautiful,

10:11.047 --> 10:13.081
in a perfect-skin, perfect-body,
perfect-hair kind of way,

10:13.082 --> 10:14.449
if you're into that sort of thing.

10:14.450 --> 10:15.751
Mm.

10:15.752 --> 10:17.653
I know you, Galavant.

10:17.654 --> 10:20.222
I know your heart, and you deserve better.

10:20.223 --> 10:23.191
You deserve to be with someone
who will lift you up as a man,

10:23.192 --> 10:25.727
someone who will fight <i> with</i> you,
not against you.

10:25.728 --> 10:27.763
Maybe someone who's small and cute

10:27.764 --> 10:29.631
and ethnically hard to pin down.

10:32.502 --> 10:33.769
What you're saying is...

10:37.540 --> 10:39.074
you <i> don't</i> think she loves me?

10:39.075 --> 10:41.176
Bloody hell.

10:41.177 --> 10:43.545
Oh, please, just stop the torture
and kill me already.

10:43.546 --> 10:44.629
I haven't started yet.

10:44.631 --> 10:45.528
He's not part of it?

10:45.530 --> 10:48.051
Will everybody just shut up?!

10:48.151 --> 10:51.186
- Do you want to know what real torture is?
- No, I'm good. Thanks.

10:55.625 --> 10:58.660
Imagine being loyal
to someone your whole life.

10:58.661 --> 10:59.895
I'm not gonna tell you who,

10:59.896 --> 11:02.864
but hypothetically,
we'll call him "the king."

11:04.567 --> 11:07.002
He's a bit of a ponce, but I like him.

11:07.003 --> 11:10.138
Then he gets married
to this rump-fed basket cockle,

11:10.139 --> 11:13.074
who, hypothetically,
we'll call "the queen."

11:13.075 --> 11:14.776
We all know who you're
talking about, Gareth.

11:14.777 --> 11:17.345
But let me be cryptic
for a minute, will ya?!

11:17.346 --> 11:19.481
Just give me that!

11:19.482 --> 11:22.717
Now, she's not like "the king."

11:22.718 --> 11:25.420
But she's strong, and I mire strength.

11:25.421 --> 11:28.990
But, then again, I've sworn
an oath to protect the king.

11:28.991 --> 11:30.325
So I don't know what to do.

11:30.326 --> 11:33.161
I mean, that's real torture,
isn't it, lads?

11:43.105 --> 11:45.240
Welcome to Richard's journey

11:45.241 --> 11:48.376
to find out why he is the way he is.

11:48.377 --> 11:50.979
There's bottles of water in easy reach.

11:50.980 --> 11:52.881
Please stay hydrated.

11:52.882 --> 11:54.149
And no kissing.

11:54.150 --> 11:55.783
Of course. Wait. What?

11:55.784 --> 11:57.485
Oh... Shouldn't be an issue.

11:57.486 --> 11:59.387
But it <i> has</i> happened in the past,

11:59.388 --> 12:01.823
so I made a blanket rule... no kissing.

12:02.925 --> 12:05.226
Mm. Good idea.

12:05.227 --> 12:07.629

15:02.470 --> 15:04.304
It <i> was</i> humiliating.

15:04.305 --> 15:07.307
Everything comes back to this moment.

15:07.308 --> 15:09.009
I have spent my entire life

I'm everyone's second choice...

15:23.157 --> 15:25.492
That was amazing!

15:25.493 --> 15:26.893
Thank you, Xanax.

15:26.894 --> 15:28.962
I now know exactly what I must do.

15:28.963 --> 15:30.797
Come on, chef! To the horses!

15:30.798 --> 15:32.532
I wouldn't ride just yet.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.334
Again, it's a legal thing.

15:34.335 --> 15:38.304
A guy once... he took his horse
through a farmers market,

15:38.305 --> 15:39.873
and there was... "raaaaaah!"

15:39.874 --> 15:42.275
The hooves and the crushing
and s-screaming, so...

15:42.276 --> 15:44.377
- Ugh...
- Let the potion wear off.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.246
An hour, say?

15:46.247 --> 15:47.280
Oh. Okay.

15:47.281 --> 15:50.416
Hey, in that case, you guys want to
see my room from when I was a kid?

15:50.417 --> 15:51.818
Wow.

15:51.819 --> 15:53.253
Let's... let's do this.

15:53.254 --> 15:53.953
Great.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.529
Listen, Galavant...

16:04.530 --> 16:06.965
I know what I did to you was horrible...

16:06.966 --> 16:08.667
probably even worse
than what Madalena did to you,

16:08.668 --> 16:10.669
because at least she had
the guts to do it to your face.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.471
And I won't say it again,

16:12.472 --> 16:14.473
but I'm more sorry than you'll ever know.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.209
Just so you know... I'm really sorry.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.411
Oh, God. You must feel
really bad. You're babbling.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.514
You only babble when you feel really bad.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.950
I do not babble when I feel bad.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.084
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.220
To be honest,
I've rather grown to like it.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.222
But you <i> do</i> babble, princess.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.491
Princess Isa-babble.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.026
"Princess Isa-babble."

16:35.027 --> 16:36.503
Okay, hang on a sec.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.764
Babbling is when someone talks nonsense,

16:38.765 --> 16:40.399
and I do not talk nonsense.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.869
I mean... Sometimes, at times,
I guess I do babble,

16:43.870 --> 16:46.071
but it's only because I have
a lot going on in my head and...

16:46.072 --> 16:47.406
oh. Never mind.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.541
Look, you don't have to feel bad.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.443
They're your parents.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.578

18:40.986 --> 18:43.087
When you love someone,
you shout it from the rooftop,

18:43.088 --> 18:44.555
not couch it in a riddle.

18:44.556 --> 18:45.823
Or in a song.

18:45.824 --> 18:47.225
That's more cinematic.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.395

No.

No, you're <i> not</i> gonna die today.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.340
And <i> you're</i> not gonna die today.

19:02.341 --> 19:04.909
And <i> you're</i> not gonna die today.

19:06.445 --> 19:07.778
You might already be dead.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.282
Well, what are you going to do?

19:11.283 --> 19:12.483
What else?

19:12.484 --> 19:14.385
Save the day.

19:17.589 --> 19:19.490
Have these been open the whole time?

19:20.926 --> 19:23.060
No one thought to check?

19:23.061 --> 19:24.495
Really?

19:30.802 --> 19:32.636
Is it done? Did you torture them?

19:32.637 --> 19:34.305
Nah.

19:34.306 --> 19:35.740
But I gave you an order.

19:35.741 --> 19:38.109
I don't give a rat's ass
about your orders.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.878
I might be a dog, but at least
I'm a loyal one, love.

19:42.147 --> 19:45.149
Now, I serve the king,
so I only follow <i> his</i> orders.

19:45.150 --> 19:48.819
That is so nice to hear.

19:48.820 --> 19:52.423
You have always been
my most loyal friend, Gareth.

19:52.424 --> 19:55.159
I know you're not a hugger,
but if you were,

19:55.160 --> 19:57.194
I would wrap myself around you

19:57.195 --> 19:59.463
like a leather jacket made of love.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.898
Mm.

20:00.899 --> 20:01.899
Xanax?

20:01.900 --> 20:03.267
- So much Xanax.
- Mm.

20:03.268 --> 20:04.435
Okay, couple of things.

20:04.436 --> 20:07.771
First, chef, I am so munchy.

20:07.772 --> 20:09.673
Could you make me, like, a cheesy omelette

20:09.674 --> 20:12.109
with some ham chunks,
potatoes fried in bacon grease?

20:12.110 --> 20:13.544
- Right away, sire.
- Excellent.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.746
Next, I'm breaking up with you.

20:15.747 --> 20:19.149
Gareth, would you please escort
Madalena down to the dungeon

20:19.150 --> 20:20.784
and lock her up forever?

20:20.785 --> 20:21.752
Huh?

20:23.955 --> 20:24.955
Come on.

20:24.956 --> 20:26.590
Wait!

20:26.591 --> 20:28.959
It would be rude to imprison your queen

20:28.960 --> 20:31.195
when we have such a special visitor.

20:31.196 --> 20:32.596
What visitor?

20:32.597 --> 20:34.832
What are you talking about?

20:35.934 --> 20:37.401
Hello, brother.

20:40.371 --> 20:41.371
Kingsley?

20:41.372 --> 20:42.439
What's he doing here?

20:42.440 --> 20:43.707
What are you doing here?

20:43.708 --> 20:45.042
I'm here to take your life.

20:45.043 --> 20:46.833
My life?

20:46.835 --> 20:48.667
Your lifestyle.

20:49.314 --> 20:50.647
Your kingdom.

20:50.648 --> 20:54.184
Of course, if you get in my way,

20:54.185 --> 20:58.200
I'll have to take your life, too...

21:01.018 --> 21:03.018
Dickie.

21:04.060 --> 21:06.023
This is gonna to be fun.

21:06.024 --> 21:08.234
