01:11.600 --> 01:13.364
Sweetheart.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.407
Go over to the window right now

01:17.480 --> 01:20.962
and open it as wide as you can.

01:21.160 --> 01:24.004
Please let me sleep.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.767
I think your mother's here from Mexico,

01:38.840 --> 01:41.605
and she needs to leave.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.684
Open the window now.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.446
Why don't you open it, you lazy...

01:51.520 --> 01:52.931
Somebody help!

01:55.000 --> 01:56.650
Close your mouth!

02:02.320 --> 02:04.607
No way. Can I ride him?

02:21.840 --> 02:23.444
A deer!

02:33.520 --> 02:35.522
Okay.

02:39.560 --> 02:44.043
Daddy, I left the front door open
in case any animals wanted to come in.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.485
- You did, huh?
- And one did.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.329
- Yeah.
- Yeah, one crazy-ass one.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.210
No, you did a nice thing, sweetheart.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.009
Greg, I'm gonna need a bat!

02:52.080 --> 02:55.004
- Daddy, no!
- No, no, I'm not going to hit the deer.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.970
I'm just going to massage his head
for a little bit with it.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.122
Okay, come on, come on.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.245
He's right here.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.163
He's eating Bowser's food.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.885
Okay, he knows we're here now.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.122
Stay. Stay.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.369
What's he looking at?

03:19.920 --> 03:21.888
Move your doll towards me.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.121
And back to you.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.929
Towards me.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.809
Back to you.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.166
Three times, fast.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.810
Give me that thing.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.565
- Mr. Gigglesworth?
- No, don't worry. Give it to me.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.688
- Go on. It's okay. It's okay.
- Put it in my hand.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.171
Roxanne, take them in there.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.009
Over there.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.163
Hey, dude. You like this guy?

03:46.720 --> 03:47.960
You want to play with him?

03:48.720 --> 03:51.883
All right, let's go play in the other room.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.810
Come on. Come on, man.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.411
Slowly walk with me.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.084
I said slowly.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.161
No.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.007
Get out of the way!

04:03.800 --> 04:05.768
Oh, my God!

04:08.160 --> 04:10.003
Problem solved.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.321
Mr. Gigglesworth! Daddy, he's killing him!

04:14.640 --> 04:16.369
A new problem begins.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.204
I'm sorry.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.170
Is that your bra, Mrs. Feder?

04:22.480 --> 04:24.244
Easy.

04:26.480 --> 04:27.606
It is nice.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.284
- Thank you, all right.
- Cool, yeah.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.600
Yeah, come on.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.002
28?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.442
Yes.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.443
35.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.968
That's right again, smarty-pants.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.281
Hi, Dad.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.125
- Hey, Bean, working on the math, huh?
- Yep.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.283
Mommy said
if I get all my math questions right,

04:54.560 --> 04:56.847
I get to ride my bike to school
with Becky Feder.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.124
Really? Okay, Bean, well,
what's seven plus nine?

05:01.200 --> 05:02.725
Seventy-nine.

05:03.680 --> 05:07.890
Is he a little boy or a computer?
'Cause I can't figure it out.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.641
Don't destroy his confidence.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.324
Happy summer, everybody.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.525
Okay, you sure you want to go
with those boots, honey?

05:17.600 --> 05:19.329
I know you bedazzled them yourself.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.243
I'm just wondering if they'll attract

05:21.320 --> 05:24.324
too much attention,
you know, from outer space.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.164
It's the last day of school,

05:26.240 --> 05:27.924
and Mom says I'm free to express myself.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.482
Building the confidence
right here with R2-D2.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.607
Confidence. K-O-B-R-Q-V-Y.

05:35.680 --> 05:36.681
Confidence.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.205
Well, we're not gonna have to
pay for college.

05:38.280 --> 05:40.089
That's for sure.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.686
Looks like a horse
took a dump in Ronnie's diaper.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.047
You're gonna need federal aid
to clean that up.

05:46.120 --> 05:49.602
Ronnie, honey, did a doo-doo grenade
go off in your diaper?

05:49.680 --> 05:52.524
- You gonna change it?
- That's not my son, that's your son.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.490
Yesterday was my diaper day.

05:55.560 --> 05:59.451
Today he is all yours,
and it's gonna get nasty.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.289
Go, Ronnie.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.203
- Go, Ronnie, go, Ronnie.
- Go, Ronnie, go, Ronnie.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.520
He looks like Nicki Minaj

06:05.600 --> 06:08.080
trying to shake her butt implants
back into place.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.731
- Go, Ronnie, go, Ronnie.
- Come on, Ronnie.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.040
Go, Ronnie.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.724
You got a lot of
appointments today, sweetie?

06:13.800 --> 06:15.404
Nah, just one repair job.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.806
Very special.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.564
All right, I'm going in.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.562
What is...

06:26.160 --> 06:28.970
What is this?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.604
A necklace?

06:31.960 --> 06:34.247
Happy 20th anniversary, babe.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.368
Wow, Dad, you remembered.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.328
Yeah.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.488
Mom didn't.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.086
That's cold.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.608
I think I'm gonna bust out of here.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.609
<i>So he gets off the train
and nobody's there?</i>

06:50.720 --> 06:52.768
<i>Braden needs to spend
at least one summer with you</i>

06:52.840 --> 06:56.242
<i>so he can say he has a dad,
you deadbeat, Higgins.</i>

06:56.320 --> 06:57.651
Well, not to be mean,

06:57.720 --> 07:00.371
but I'm not even 1,000% sure who you are.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.769
<i>I was up from Florida.</i>

07:02.840 --> 07:07.084
<i>Right in the middle of making out,
I got a really bad case of the hiccups.</i>

07:07.160 --> 07:09.162
Hiccups McGee?

07:09.280 --> 07:13.683
Oh, my God, I have a kid I don't
know about with Hiccups McGee?

07:13.760 --> 07:15.489
And no offense, but I'm gonna have to ask

07:15.560 --> 07:16.766
for a DNA test, you know,

07:16.840 --> 07:19.366
because you just never...

07:21.120 --> 07:23.168
No need.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.890
Later, Hiccups.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.365
You're him.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.489
Yeah, without the hat.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.767
It's actually a good likeness.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.207
How you doing, man?

07:47.440 --> 07:48.566
I'm your dad.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.411
Nice to see you, Braden.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.404
That's strike one.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.130
Good news is, you get...

07:56.200 --> 07:58.009
Unlimited amount of strikes.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.204
How about I take you to school?

08:01.600 --> 08:03.443
No school.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.170
Summertime.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.925
Not yet. One more day. I know, it's a drag.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.571
Normally I'd let you just blow it off
and play hooky,

08:10.640 --> 08:12.927
but I'm volunteering
at the soup kitchen today,

08:13.000 --> 08:14.570
so when I'm done,

08:14.680 --> 08:16.921
I'll come pick you up and we'll hang out.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.445
I got you this, but...

08:18.560 --> 08:21.723
Obviously you're, like,
13, so I don't know,

08:21.800 --> 08:23.245
but it's actually pretty nice

08:23.320 --> 08:25.687
and cute,
and you should cut the head off it, okay.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.166
Well, let's get going.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.409
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, don't forget this.
- Is it a gift?

08:32.480 --> 08:34.687
No, it's the Gigglesworth massacre.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.922
I told Becky you could
sew it back together for her.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.206
What?

08:38.280 --> 08:40.203
Martha Stewart couldn't fix this.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.405
Come on.

08:41.480 --> 08:45.371
But you're such a good daddy
for picking up all the pieces.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.090
That's why I've been thinking,

08:47.160 --> 08:48.730
we moved back here to your hometown

08:48.840 --> 08:51.411
so we could have more quality
time with our family, right?

08:51.480 --> 08:52.606
That's right.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.720
How would you feel about expanding?

08:56.800 --> 08:58.962
- Having another kid?
- Yeah.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.727
But it's perfect right now, you know?

09:02.800 --> 09:05.246
If I buy one large pizza,
Greg gets two pieces,

09:05.320 --> 09:07.971
Keith gets two, Becky gets one,
you get one, I get four.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.280
It's kind of perfect, you know.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.001
I don't want to have to buy another pie.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.567
Why don't you go on a diet, fat <i>gordo Ã©ste?</i>

09:14.680 --> 09:16.489
Come on, I've had a job since I'm 16.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.483
It's the first time I've
got a free schedule.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.085
I'm just enjoying the fun.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.766
Don't forget Becky's
ballet recital at 11:00.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.724
I got to go to that?

09:24.800 --> 09:27.007
I mean, I get to go to that? Great.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.841
I'm saying, that's... I thought it was sold out.
That's great news.

09:31.160 --> 09:34.004
Have the best last day of
school, my gorgeous children!

09:34.080 --> 09:35.366
I love you all!

09:35.440 --> 09:36.885
- Bye, Mom, bye.
- Bye, Mom.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.291
Yeah, last day of school, Greg.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.128
Last chance to ask out Nancy Arbuckle.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.248
Nancy Arbuckle... What's that?
You like a girl?

09:43.320 --> 09:45.800
Is that why you've been taking
them long showers?

09:45.880 --> 09:47.450
No, I'm conditioning my hair.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.091
That's all I do in the shower...
Condition my hair.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.400
That's not what the deer told me.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.686
That deer's a liar.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.123
I heard too much conditioning
can make you go blind.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.571
What? Where'd you hear that?

09:58.640 --> 10:00.927
- Higgins.
- I should kill him.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.602
He's too chicken to ask her out, Dad,
'cause she's the hottest girl in school,

10:04.680 --> 10:05.761
and Greg is fugly.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.286
So what he's fugly?
All the guys in our family are fugly.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.249
That don't stop us from
getting the hot chicks.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.290
Look at me and look at your mother.
I mean, it makes no sense.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.964
Only in, like, a Hollywood
movie or something.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.769
Every guy in school likes her, Dad.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.086
And you'll be the guy who ends up with her.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.925
You know why?
You're gonna follow my three-step program.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.446
Number one, make the girl smile.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.801
Number two, tell her she has a nice smile.

10:25.880 --> 10:29.282
Number three, say she has to
go out with you that night.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.327
Why that night?

10:30.440 --> 10:32.727
'Cause it gives her less time
to think about how fugly you are.

10:32.840 --> 10:33.966
'Cause you are fugly.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.769
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

10:35.840 --> 10:39.128
And Keithie's right...
I'm too chicken to even talk to her.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.164
Hey, you're a Feder.
Feders ain't afraid of women, buddy.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.924
That's not the way I'm raising you.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.201
By the way, Dad, did you
ask Mom if I can play football?

10:46.240 --> 10:47.605
No, I was scared.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.729
I'm afraid she's gonna yell at me
in that accent that no one understands.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.723
Come on, Becky, it's 8:00.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.365
School starts at 8:15.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.569
That means we only have 25 minutes.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.806
Daddy, you promise
Mr. Gigglesworth will be better by bedtime?

11:03.880 --> 11:06.486
Will you stop worrying about him?
He'll be fine. I love you.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.329
- Have the best last day, okay?
- Okay.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.561
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Daddy.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.847
- Love you.
- And you read the street signs, okay?

11:11.920 --> 11:13.081
Don't let Bean.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.204
My God, riding their bikes to school.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.891
Couldn't do that in L.A.
with the nuts out there.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.770
Yeah, 'cause thank God
there's no crazy people out here.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.520
How you doing, Nick?

11:29.680 --> 11:33.048
My wife's leaving me after three weeks.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.521
Three weeks? That's not bad for you.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.045
What happened?

11:37.120 --> 11:40.488
She found me eating a banana with my butt.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.404
And she didn't like that?

11:42.480 --> 11:44.562
Yeah, she got really bummed out,

11:44.680 --> 11:47.729
but, you know, I shouldn't have
done it at her mom's house.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.202
Yeah, you... You seem like you're
a little extra out of it today.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.361
What's going on?

11:52.480 --> 11:53.811
Yeah, I'm a little medicated.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.884
I met a very reliable doctor
at a Cypress Hill concert,

11:56.960 --> 11:59.770
and he floated me a couple pills
just to feel better, you know.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.841
But I don't feel better!

12:00.920 --> 12:02.570
You feel worse!

12:08.840 --> 12:12.162
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet your new bus driver.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.324
Finally got yourself a job.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.687
Actually I'm filling in for
Drool-io Iglesias back there.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.889
Hey, Deanne, happy anniversary.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.202
Thank you, Lenny.

12:27.360 --> 12:30.091
Lenny remembered. Isn't that sweet?

12:30.160 --> 12:32.766
- And I never got him pregnant.
- She forgot?

12:32.880 --> 12:35.247
- Yeah, she forgot.
- No.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.641
I got the biggest get-out-of-jail-free card
in the world.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.210
I want one of those.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.810
You ain't never get one like this.
Hey, honey,

12:40.880 --> 12:43.087
I'm gonna take a ride to work with Lenny.

12:43.160 --> 12:46.562
Don't worry about forgetting the 20th.
I'm sure you'll remember the 30th.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.808
I love you.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.611
Yeah, sure you do... Deep down.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.651
That's not another
necklace in there, is it?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.680
I'm gonna abuse this
get-out-of-jail-free card,

13:06.760 --> 13:08.125
I'm telling you right now.

13:08.200 --> 13:12.046
I mean, maybe I'll walk on the good rug
without taking off my boots.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.442
Or have a nice non-diet
soda with my dinner.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.410
Not just one, either, a whole damn pitcher.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.403
- So you're going full gangsta.
- Yeah.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.130
But you know what I'd really like to do?

13:22.200 --> 13:23.645
Throw a "first night of summer" party.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.131
- Yeah.
- You know, something a little crazy.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.244
Well, it's been many, many years
since we've done something crazy.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.685
Just one problem, though.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.410
My house isn't big enough.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.084
But yours is.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.731
Last party I had
was senior year in high school.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.723
Yeah, that was, like, the
best night of my life.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.801
We all hooked up with chicks.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.649
Come on, why not do that again?

13:40.720 --> 13:45.442
Because we already have chicks and kids
and high cholesterol now, so just...

13:45.520 --> 13:47.568
It's time to move on.
You want to come over tonight with Dee,

13:47.680 --> 13:48.841
that's fine... I think.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.160
I got to ask my wife first.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.163
Okay, gangsta.

13:52.240 --> 13:57.007
Hey, hey, where'd you get
those shoes, Losers "R" Us?

13:57.080 --> 13:58.161
I made them.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.685
You made them?

13:59.760 --> 14:01.285
In a toilet?

14:02.760 --> 14:04.683
That kid's like White Precious.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.047
Get lost, Duffy.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.485
Yeah, leave her alone.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.528
Hey, what'd you say, Hollywood?

14:10.600 --> 14:13.206
- You got something to say to me?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.443
<i>Attention, Kmart shoppers,
let's find a seat, please.</i>

14:16.520 --> 14:17.851
<i>Yes, you in the camouflage jacket</i>

14:17.960 --> 14:19.610
<i>and Mariah Carey hairdo.</i>

14:19.680 --> 14:22.081
<i>Yeah, just pop a squat, thank you.</i>

14:22.160 --> 14:25.528
You're lucky your dad's here,
but he won't be here all day.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.601
Leave me alone.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.728
<i>Beanbag with arms and legs,</i>

14:28.800 --> 14:30.086
<i>seriously, take a seat,</i>

14:30.160 --> 14:32.083
<i>or seats, before someone gets hurt.</i>

14:33.320 --> 14:35.163
You're dead, man.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.763
I'm gonna go get some things done,

14:47.840 --> 14:50.684
and then I'm gonna go
to my daughter's ballet recital,

14:50.760 --> 14:52.728
so you're on your own until lunchtime.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.962
No worries. No one will come in anyway.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.882
Right.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.447
Does Leonard ever talk about me?

15:02.520 --> 15:03.931
Leonard?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.001
Your husband.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.650
Lenny.

15:06.720 --> 15:10.008
I probably should have told you this
before I started working here,

15:10.080 --> 15:13.084
but he used to be my boyfriend.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.802
When did you guys go out?

15:18.880 --> 15:19.961
Sixth grade.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.607
This one time,

15:21.680 --> 15:25.526
we split a piece of bubble gum at recess.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.604
I brought in a note

15:30.680 --> 15:35.129
that he sent me, and I
thought you should see it.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.044
I just felt weird having a secret with you.

15:41.040 --> 15:45.284
"Do you like my hair better
in a barrette or a headband?"

15:45.360 --> 15:46.486
That's what I wrote.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.289
"Barrette."

15:48.360 --> 15:50.249
And that was his response.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.688
Does it bother you that I still wear it?

15:56.760 --> 16:00.321
No, no, no, I think it's sweet.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.882
I think he still has feelings for me.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.884
I'm gonna go work out now.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.486
Do you really think that
a tight, toned body

16:09.560 --> 16:11.801
will keep him away
from his Hubba Bubba baby?

16:11.880 --> 16:15.009
I hope so. Bye.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.487
You just messed with the wrong girl, <i>chica!</i>

16:21.120 --> 16:23.487
They spray-painted my baby.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.164
Gee, and everything's spelled right.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.969
These can't be my students.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.766
Have a nice day, Rapunzel.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.491
Hey, guys, can you believe this?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.403
Calendar turns to June,

16:38.480 --> 16:40.926
my wonderful students,
they become animals.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.604
Maybe they're just mad that you keep going

16:42.680 --> 16:44.170
to the babyGap to buy your clothes.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.163
Hey, Principal Tardio, good morning.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.004
Right to class, right to class.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.845
How was your last ride in
before the summer, Nick?

16:53.440 --> 16:55.408
Remember, today is only a half a day.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.209
- And a half a shirt, right?
- What?

16:57.280 --> 16:59.123
- I said he wants to wave good-bye to you.
- Okay.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.568
- Here he goes.
- I'm excited about the summer, too.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.722
Hey, that's my laptop!
That's not waterproof!

17:04.800 --> 17:07.531
- Monkey boy, monkey boy.
- Summer!

17:07.599 --> 17:09.602
- Monkey boy.
- Summer!

17:09.680 --> 17:12.444
Summer! Summer!

17:13.760 --> 17:15.603
So, what do you think?

17:15.720 --> 17:17.290
Do I take you straight to work?

17:17.359 --> 17:22.048
I got one appointment I got to get to
sometime between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.

17:22.119 --> 17:23.201
- Okay.
- But she can wait.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.442
Good. And look at this.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.284
He's back at it again.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.811
Why isn't he at work?

17:28.880 --> 17:34.011
He's just... This woman has a grip on him. It's ridiculous.
It's gonna ruin his marriage.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.769
Thank you for breakfast, Mommy.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.844
Will you be coming by to watch
<i>Days</i> of Our <i>Lives</i> later?

17:39.960 --> 17:43.442
Well, we got to find out which
twin murdered Renaldo, right?

17:43.520 --> 17:44.806
We sure do.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.050
- Okay.
- Hey, Mrs. Lamonsoff,

17:48.120 --> 17:49.121
good to see you.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.407
Nice school bus, Lenny.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.164
Thank you. Have a great day.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.049
Did Mommy make the boo-boo go away?

17:55.120 --> 17:56.849
Don't tell the wife.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.046
What are you guys doing?

17:58.120 --> 17:59.849
Get in.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.962
Oh, hey, Nick.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.121
Nice. Nice.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.565
Let's hit it.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.483
Watch this.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.447
- Wow.
- You got to respect that.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.521
That was awesome.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.848
What's Lenny's problem?
They're so cute when they're little.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.128
I know. I miss it.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.771
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.044
You miss that? Really?

18:28.560 --> 18:30.562
Stay. Stay.

18:30.640 --> 18:31.926
Don't you growl at me.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.081
Stay, baby, Stay-

18:33.160 --> 18:34.286
Excuse me.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.442
Is your kid gonna be in here
when the instructor comes in?

18:36.520 --> 18:37.965
That's not my kid.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.850
That's my lover, and he's very gentle.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.602
Kids don't belong in here.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.364
That leash better not trip me up.

18:47.480 --> 18:48.925
Leash isn't gonna trip you up.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.083
It's your big-ass, hairy man feet
that are gonna trip you up.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.729
She was just joking around, sir.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.484
Cool it. You're gonna get us killed.

18:58.560 --> 19:01.086
I'm sorry. I'm having the worst day.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.407
Welcome to Squat Fitness, ladies.

19:03.640 --> 19:06.644
Apparently your new instructor's
running a bit late.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.484
I'm sorry. It's only five till...

19:08.560 --> 19:11.404
Yeah, so he asked me to lead you
in some warm-up exercises.

19:11.520 --> 19:14.649
So, everybody, up on your feet,

19:14.720 --> 19:17.291
and let's take a deep breath.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.646
Good.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.967
Deeper... Really stretch out those lungs.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.201
And now let's shimmy.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.680
Shake the shoulders back and forth.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.449
Shake them.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.244
Very good, very good.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.926
Yeah, oh, yeah.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.446
Now let's do some jackhammer squats.

19:32.640 --> 19:35.007
Right, put your hands
in front of you like this. Just relax.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.923
And then squat up and down but fast.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.570
Faster, faster, there you go.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.641
Really fast.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.324
Faster, faster.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.243
Too fast. Do it a little slower.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.606
Now, everybody turn,

19:44.680 --> 19:47.126
face the back of the room, bend over,

19:47.200 --> 19:48.690
and reach for your toes.

19:48.760 --> 19:49.807
Why do we have to turn around?

19:49.880 --> 19:51.041
If you please.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.727
And bend over as low as you can go.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.447
Now take the right hand and
slap it against the right cheek.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.365
Relax the wrist and slap
that right butt, slap it.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.251
Good, I want to hear that slap.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.687
Yes, this is wonderful.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.042
Morning, ladies.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.565
You started without me?

20:11.640 --> 20:13.802
Yes, just like you asked me to.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.362
Say it's true even if it isn't.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.169
What?

20:18.240 --> 20:21.005
You loved it! You loved it!

20:23.960 --> 20:25.883
Yeah, that's my boy.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.327
- All right.
- You're all prostitutes!

20:28.480 --> 20:30.448
Anyway. I'm Kyle,

20:30.520 --> 20:34.366
and welcome to the summer
session of Squatrobics 101.

20:34.440 --> 20:38.206
I wish they called it something else,
but that's what they told me to say.

20:38.280 --> 20:42.001
Okay, so, before we start for real,

20:42.080 --> 20:43.206
any questions?

20:43.280 --> 20:44.566
Yes.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.966
Are you married?

20:46.040 --> 20:47.121
No.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.361
Nope, I'm... I'm single.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.169
Yeah.

20:50.240 --> 20:54.564
I forgot.
You're so gorgeous, my head is spinning.

20:54.640 --> 20:55.926
I'm sorry. God.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.046
Go ahead.

20:58.120 --> 21:02.205
I have a very important question,
and it's a two-parter.

21:02.320 --> 21:05.688
The first part of the question is,
"Did a scientist make you in a lab?"

21:05.760 --> 21:07.444
And the second part of the question is,

21:07.520 --> 21:09.841
"Can I stick my tongue
down your throat, please?"

21:09.920 --> 21:13.606
All right, guys, look,
I'm flattered. Really, I am,

21:13.680 --> 21:17.605
but most of you are married
and I happen to be gay.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.486
Of course he is.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.210
- All of 'em.
- That sucks!

21:22.280 --> 21:23.486
What a waste!

21:23.560 --> 21:24.971
Stay out of my bag, little man.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.084
Why does she have this?

21:27.160 --> 21:29.367
That's not a jock strap,
that's a G-string.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.006
Well, well, well,

21:55.080 --> 21:56.684
if it isn't Hollywood

21:56.760 --> 21:59.161
and the Squares.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.481
Hey, Malcolm, I didn't
know you worked at Kmart,

22:01.560 --> 22:04.325
and apparently the hair on top of your head
didn't know it, either.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.561
What?

22:05.640 --> 22:06.846
Do me a favor, go like this.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.604
I think I got something in my teeth.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.006
- What?
- You know,

22:10.080 --> 22:13.482
next time, you should use
that Chia Pet stuff on your whole head.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.840
What?

22:14.920 --> 22:15.887
Why is Higgins buying

22:15.960 --> 22:17.371
O.J.'s knife right now?

22:17.480 --> 22:19.608
- You think you're tough?
- Hey, Malcolm,

22:19.680 --> 22:22.286
is that the knife the Indians
used to half-scalp you with?

22:22.400 --> 22:23.606
I don't even get that.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.966
What?

22:25.040 --> 22:26.121
Come on, let's cheer him up

22:26.240 --> 22:27.526
Benny Hill-style. Here we go.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.726
Come On, come On, come On, come On...

22:28.800 --> 22:29.961
Does that make you feel better?

22:30.040 --> 22:33.840
Yo, Crocodile Dumb-dee,
how'd it go with the kid?

22:33.920 --> 22:35.684
Good, good. He's in school.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.683
Kid's in school for one day?

22:37.760 --> 22:40.889
I didn't know what else to do.
He's a thug, Lenny.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.531
He cut the head off a teddy bear.
Imagine what he'll do to me.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.080
So you're gonna buy this
to cut his head off?

22:46.160 --> 22:48.367
No, I just want him to think
I'll cut his head off

22:48.440 --> 22:50.010
so then he won't cut my head off.

22:50.080 --> 22:53.050
You want to scare a relative
without causing permanent injury?

22:53.440 --> 22:55.647
May <i>I</i> Suggest this?

22:59.160 --> 23:03.927
Sir? Sir? Can you get off the bed?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.729
It's wake-up time.

23:05.800 --> 23:10.408
Yeah, all right, Grandma, I'm up!
Stop yelling at me.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.608
Now, why is... Being mean?

23:12.680 --> 23:16.048
I like sleeping over. It's
just you always yell.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.122
You don't have to yell at me.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.009
I love you.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.445
I don't understand.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.249
<i>Clean-up, aisle nine.</i>

23:26.320 --> 23:28.766
Get out of me!

23:28.840 --> 23:31.730
<i>And bring a shovel.</i>

23:33.000 --> 23:35.367
So, my son Bumpty told me

23:35.440 --> 23:38.091
he's gonna ask your daughter
out on a date at school today.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.970
First of all, my daughter's
never been out on a date before,

23:41.040 --> 23:43.930
and I'm sure she's not gonna start off
with some kid named Bumpty.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.970
He is the only other
black kid in her grade.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.849
Wait, you want her to date a white guy?

23:48.920 --> 23:50.445
Yeah, Farrakhan.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.640
I'd rather she date the whitest
white guy in the world

23:52.680 --> 23:54.762
than your little bald-headed boy.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.930
All right, but, you know,
don't worry when she says yes,

23:58.040 --> 23:59.690
'cause I already had the talk with him.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.524
- What talk?
- Dating.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.410
I told him how we used to roll
with the ladies in high school.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.882
You know, beep-beep.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.801
What?

24:12.880 --> 24:15.326
I should get some pepper spray for my kid.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.846
Some moron on the bus
keeps messing with him,

24:17.920 --> 24:19.729
and he refuses to fight back.

24:19.800 --> 24:22.167
You know, that reminds me
of someone I know.

24:22.240 --> 24:23.685
- Who?
- You.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.683
What are you talking about?
I got in plenty of fights.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.524
Remember ninth grade
when Tommy Cavanaugh

24:27.600 --> 24:29.045
moved here from Texas?

24:29.120 --> 24:32.602
He nonstop abused you,
and you did nothing about it.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.523
<i>Tommy Cavanaugh was a 'row freak.</i>

24:34.600 --> 24:36.602
He had back zits on his back zits.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.284
Plus, he was joking around with me.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.330
If it was real, I swear to God,
I would've knocked him out.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.606
Hey, isn't that Cavanaugh right there?

24:42.680 --> 24:44.648
Where?

24:45.600 --> 24:46.647
Gotcha.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.848
That was really funny, man, really funny.

24:48.920 --> 24:52.641
Hey, you weren't exactly Captain Courageous
when we were growing up, now, were you?

24:52.760 --> 24:54.603
Hey, I never backed out of a fight, though.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.166
Yeah, but did you ever jump
off Suicide 35 at the quarry?

24:57.240 --> 24:58.765
That's right.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.922
He always came up
with a lame excuse not to do it.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.561
- What are you talking about?
- "I can't.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.887
"I'm on my period. It'll attract sharks."

25:05.680 --> 25:10.004
Suicide 35 off the top rock.
35 feet above the water.

25:10.080 --> 25:13.323
My mom did that jump
when she was pregnant with me.

25:22.760 --> 25:24.524
There's a raft in there?

25:32.240 --> 25:34.163
Who did that?

25:35.920 --> 25:38.764
All right, little birds.
Find your nests, man.

25:38.960 --> 25:42.646
Float down. There we go, and we're in.

25:42.720 --> 25:43.801
All right, guys,

25:43.880 --> 25:47.202
normally we don't have exciting news
this late into the term,

25:47.280 --> 25:50.648
but we have a new student joining us today,
Braden Higgins.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.960
Hey, there's an empty seat over there, man.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.327
Why don't you go cop a squat?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.568
Or go that way, man.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.642
Take your own path.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.923
No.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.411
I sit here.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.562
Is your dad Marcus Higgins?

26:19.680 --> 26:22.251
Yeah, I've known him since I was a baby.
He's the funniest.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.448
The best. Great, great man.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.490
I want to smash his face.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.562
- Yeah, me, too.
- Yeah, I hate that guy.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.529
Screw him.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.766
Yo, Charlotte, hold up, hold up.
Question...

26:38.840 --> 26:41.923
How would you like to spend
the first night of summer

26:42.000 --> 26:44.765
with a hardcore up-and-comer?

26:45.840 --> 26:47.046
What does that mean?

26:47.120 --> 26:48.610
I think he's asking you out.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.727
He is?

26:49.800 --> 26:51.370
You are?

26:51.440 --> 26:52.965
I don't make stuff up.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.407
Well, can Donna come?

26:55.480 --> 26:57.403
Three's a crowd, McCloud.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.562
No, he didn't. Yes, he did.

26:59.680 --> 27:03.366
It's okay, Charlotte.
It's a date, your first date.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.566
Just you two.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.130
All right. I mean,

27:08.200 --> 27:09.929
I'd have to ask my parents,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.526
but I think that would be okay.

27:12.600 --> 27:13.601
Hey, Bumpty.

27:13.680 --> 27:16.126
You think just because
it's the last day of school,

27:16.200 --> 27:19.283
you can sit and socialize
the entire period?

27:19.360 --> 27:22.443
I don't think about stuff like that,
Lady Shorts.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.726
Well, can you think fast?

27:26.400 --> 27:29.006
Who wants to watch me climb a rope?

27:29.080 --> 27:32.402
Yeah!

27:34.080 --> 27:35.081
You're the man!

27:36.400 --> 27:40.121
Yo, he's got to put those Easter eggs
back in the basket.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.725
Dang!

27:41.800 --> 27:43.848
Kelly, I don't want to hear it!

27:44.040 --> 27:45.769
I can't take it anymore!

27:45.840 --> 27:48.002
I wish I never had you!

27:48.080 --> 27:49.764
Stop it! Stop it!

27:49.840 --> 27:51.808
See, that's why I don't want four kids.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.244
- Yeah, people with four just lose their minds.
- Yeah.

27:54.360 --> 27:55.600
They're yelling, they're screaming.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.762
Sometimes they go to jail
just to get some sleep.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.286
Hold up. Hang on.

28:00.360 --> 28:01.600
I got a burpsnart coming.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.886
- Come on.
- You got to teach me how you do that.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.450
- A burpsnart? It's simple.
- Yeah.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.170
You just start with a burp,

28:11.240 --> 28:13.049
then you sniff for a sneeze,
you get that going,

28:13.120 --> 28:14.326
and that triggers a fart, always.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.641
What's up with this school bus?

28:16.720 --> 28:19.644
Okay. I stole it.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.967
What? Put your hands in the air.

28:23.880 --> 28:27.362
<i>And wave them like you just don't care
"ho"</i>

28:28.440 --> 28:29.441
<i>"ho"</i>

28:31.120 --> 28:33.168
I heard you're having a
party tonight, Lenny.

28:33.240 --> 28:35.322
What? I'm not having a party.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.487
Where did you hear that?

28:36.560 --> 28:39.086
He's a cop. He hears everything.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.161
Oh, God.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.964
Look, it's Magnum P.U.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.160
Look at him getting all serious.
I still can't believe

28:44.200 --> 28:47.044
you're a cop after all the
sick stuff you did growing up.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.731
The Peter Dante who stole
your parents' snowmobile

28:49.800 --> 28:52.644
and sold it to purchase
crack cocaine is dead, Feder.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.404
This side of the law is way better.

28:54.480 --> 28:57.006
To serve and protect. Got to love it.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.321
Hey, McKenzie, I heard you
assaulted somebody in there.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.563
I didn't assault anybody.
I just choked out your brother.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.803
Yeah, he deserves it. He's crazy.

29:05.880 --> 29:08.690
We got five minutes
to get to that stupid recital.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.842
Recital?

29:10.920 --> 29:13.161
- At McDonough Elementary?
- Yes.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.322
- Can I come?
- Why?

29:15.440 --> 29:17.602
Trust me. Everybody's got to go.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.409
We got five minutes.
We're never gonna make it there.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.606
You'll get there on time,

29:20.680 --> 29:23.968
'cause we're gonna give you
a four-alarm presidential police escort.

29:24.040 --> 29:25.280
Isn't that against the law?

29:25.360 --> 29:27.044
I am the law!

29:28.480 --> 29:30.528
What's happening?

29:45.640 --> 29:47.688
Oh, my God! What just happened?

29:53.320 --> 29:58.281
Welcome, parents,
to final performance of school year,

29:58.400 --> 29:59.401
our June-a-licious

29:59.480 --> 30:01.767
Dance Spectacular!

30:06.640 --> 30:08.085
Now, for this year,

30:08.200 --> 30:09.929
we go throwing a few

30:10.000 --> 30:11.445
hip-hop moves in there.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.522
Like this.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.491
Is fun to dance.

30:22.560 --> 30:25.040
Let the show begin.

30:28.360 --> 30:33.127
So nice of you
to invite your friends and the bus driver

30:33.200 --> 30:36.124
and the police force
to our daughter's dance recital.

30:36.200 --> 30:40.603
Yeah, huge ballet fans, all of them.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.050
She's so cute.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.640
- So cute.
- She's adorable, isn't she?

31:06.680 --> 31:07.966
She is adorable.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.610
- Fantastic stuff.
- Unbelievable.

31:09.720 --> 31:11.290
- Look at her go.
- I am.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.283
I'm looking at her.

31:24.520 --> 31:28.525
I want to arrest her for
disturbing the peace.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.602
In my pants.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.090
I'm having a wonderful time.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.648
She's got a solo?

31:53.360 --> 31:54.600
What?

32:04.040 --> 32:08.125
It's fine. I just wish that you
would give me more than eight hours notice

32:08.200 --> 32:10.328
before you tell me that
we're throwing a party, babe.

32:10.400 --> 32:11.765
It's not a party. Get out of here.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.285
- It's a couple people coming by.
- Come on.

32:13.360 --> 32:14.725
How'd you like it?

32:14.800 --> 32:16.529
- You were great, honey.
- Hey!

32:16.600 --> 32:18.523
Where did you learn to dance like that?

32:18.600 --> 32:20.523
She moves like "Yagger," no?

32:20.600 --> 32:22.364
Yes, she does, she moves like...

32:22.440 --> 32:23.930
Mick Yagger? Is that what you were saying?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.241
Hey, butter buns,
you ready to grab some eats?

32:26.320 --> 32:28.243
Yes.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.924
Cavanaugh.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.321
Lenny Feder, I'll be damned.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.643
Honey, this is Tommy Cavanaugh.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.529
He was my old steroid that I grew up with.

32:37.640 --> 32:38.641
This is my...

32:38.720 --> 32:40.768
Wife, Roxanne.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.490
Why are your hands shaking, Daddy?

32:42.560 --> 32:43.766
My hands are shaking?

32:43.840 --> 32:45.490
Probably because I

32:45.560 --> 32:47.801
had too much coffee
this morning, sweetheart.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.451
I heard you been running around
saying you could take me in a fight.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.682
You... I wouldn't say that.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.569
Yeah, you did, this morning in Kmart.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.324
Kmart? Was I there?

32:56.400 --> 32:58.368
- I don't think I was there.
- You know,

32:58.440 --> 32:59.805
all I can remember about this guy

32:59.880 --> 33:01.723
is smacking him around
whenever I wanted to,

33:01.800 --> 33:03.723
and him not doing a single thing about it.

33:03.800 --> 33:07.168
Yeah, we had a lot of
good times like that growing up.

33:07.240 --> 33:10.084
Why is your voice so shaky, Daddy?
Are you crying?

33:10.160 --> 33:12.208
You don't stop talking, do you?

33:12.280 --> 33:14.123
Honey, we should be getting going.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.326
Sure, baby.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.520
I want you to stop making up
lies about kicking my ass

33:17.560 --> 33:18.971
or I'm gonna have to set you straight.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.280
Sure, sure, sure.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.124
I'll see you around.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.010
Becky, you be having great summer.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.489
I was one inch away

33:28.560 --> 33:30.847
from knocking that guy out,
and I swear to God.

33:30.920 --> 33:31.921
No, you weren't.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.570
This is grown-up talk,

33:33.640 --> 33:35.085
so butt out!

33:36.960 --> 33:39.201
That's insane! What did you say to him?

33:39.280 --> 33:42.170
I said, "Hey, Cavanaugh,
you speak to me like that again

33:42.240 --> 33:45.210
"in front of my wife and kid,
I will brush your teeth with a brick."

33:45.280 --> 33:47.408
No, you didn't. You just yelled at me.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.403
- I don't yell at you!
- Calm down.

33:49.480 --> 33:50.686
No, I'm just saying.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.125
You guys were in the bathroom.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.282
Look who's here, everybody.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.250
20 VOSS waters, right?

33:57.320 --> 33:59.209
- That's how they do it in Hollyweird.
- I don't know.

33:59.280 --> 34:02.602
We haven't lived there in, what,
10 months now or something?

34:02.720 --> 34:06.122
As a matter of fact, our son
starts work here tonight.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.726
I know. I heard you brown-nosed Mr. Pappas

34:08.800 --> 34:11.121
and now Showbiz Junior's got a job.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.726
I used to scoop cones here,
and why shouldn't he?

34:13.800 --> 34:15.643
It's a great first job for a kid.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.367
Or lifetime job.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.248
Okay, what are we having?

34:21.320 --> 34:22.481
Becky, what do you want, hon?

34:22.639 --> 34:25.041
Can I have the soft chocolate cup, please?

34:25.120 --> 34:27.851
Here's a word you probably never heard, no.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.291
The machine's busted, princess.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.603
Bummer, it's broken? Like all your dreams?

34:33.639 --> 34:35.641
You know what, it's easy to fix.
I can help you with that.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.081
What do you know about fixing
ice cream machines, Higgins?

34:38.159 --> 34:40.367
I went to DeVry for a year.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.726
- That's right.
- I can fix anything with a plug.

34:42.800 --> 34:43.926
Including your hair?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.400
That's not true.
I don't even know how that got started.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.090
That's, like, people are
saying that around town.

34:48.159 --> 34:49.286
I'll walk you through it.

34:49.360 --> 34:51.601
You just walk up,
climb up the machine, lean over the back.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.360
Can't believe I'm listening to this idiot.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.400
Listen to the man.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.606
You're gonna see

34:55.679 --> 34:56.726
two pipes coming into the top.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.450
- Yes!
- In between them,

34:58.520 --> 34:59.931
there's gonna be a silver button.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.001
Hit it a little bit.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.127
Push hard.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.009
No. Hit it with your fist.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.770
Yeah, just push the button.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.444
- I got it.
- There we go!

35:07.520 --> 35:09.045
I think we're getting somewhere.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.360
Okay, keep going. Yeah, that...

35:11.200 --> 35:12.281
Force it. That's it.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.607
Hey! Why is Dickie crapping
all over the ice cream stand?

35:17.680 --> 35:18.647
What'd she say?

35:18.760 --> 35:20.967
- Nothing! Nothing!
- Go! Just go!

35:22.880 --> 35:24.962
Go, Dickie!

35:25.040 --> 35:27.964
That's where ice cream comes from?

35:28.040 --> 35:34.400
And so we've reached the end
of another school year.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.801
<i>Froot Loop?</i>

35:37.880 --> 35:38.881
Ten months

35:38.960 --> 35:41.930
<i>of learning, growth</i>

35:42.000 --> 35:43.729
<i>and, yes, hopefully,</i>

35:43.800 --> 35:45.962
<i>a little bit of fun.</i>

35:46.080 --> 35:50.404
<i>But the journey we began
together, in September,</i>

35:50.560 --> 35:53.006
<i>does not end today.</i>

35:53.080 --> 35:56.050
<i>For education is a process</i>

35:56.120 --> 36:00.603
<i>that does not begin and end
on some set schedule...</i>

36:02.240 --> 36:05.050
Please let me finish. Return to your seats.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.321
Damn you!

36:08.400 --> 36:09.890
Every year, you do this to me!

36:09.960 --> 36:13.601
<i>And this was my favorite shirt
from when I was 12!</i>

36:13.680 --> 36:15.409
How you doing, sophomore?

36:15.480 --> 36:16.891
Not bad, sophomore.

36:16.960 --> 36:17.961
Come here!

36:25.280 --> 36:27.521
Hey, you're not a statue.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.364
<i>You' re an ass-me.</i>

36:30.120 --> 36:31.849
Doesn't even make any sense.

36:31.960 --> 36:33.166
Shut up!

36:35.400 --> 36:37.209
What? What? What?

36:37.280 --> 36:40.045
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

36:44.280 --> 36:45.691
What's up, man?

36:45.760 --> 36:46.841
Your dad picking you up?

36:47.920 --> 36:49.570
I don't know.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.881
I told him it'd be cool if he
stayed late at the soup kitchen,

36:51.960 --> 36:53.724
so it's on me.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.326
Well, you can come on the bus
with us, if you want.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.408
Nah, how about we do something fun?

36:59.320 --> 37:02.369
How about we do something
we're not supposed to?

37:04.360 --> 37:05.771
"Keep out."

37:05.840 --> 37:08.320
That just makes me want to not keep out.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.570
Heard our dads used to come
swimming here, back in the day.

37:11.640 --> 37:15.690
They claim to be all squeaky clean,
but I think they were nuts.

37:27.480 --> 37:28.925
College kids.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.684
We better go.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.402
No go.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.851
Stay.

37:45.200 --> 37:47.089
He's nuts.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.281
Let's go.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.441
Hey!

37:49.520 --> 37:50.965
Where are you guys going?

37:51.080 --> 37:53.890
Join the party.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.363
Here. One and two.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.003
Are you guys freshmen?

38:00.080 --> 38:01.809
No. We're seniors.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.451
We just became seniors,
like, 20 minutes ago.

38:04.520 --> 38:06.682
Not high school seniors, college seniors.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.330
Wait a minute!

38:08.400 --> 38:10.129
I remember you guys.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.964
You're Scully.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.008
You're Boomer.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.245
Come here.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.765
I love you guys so much.

38:17.840 --> 38:20.366
- I love you, too.
- Girl, I love you more.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.965
I'm gonna go.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.042
Body shots!

38:24.400 --> 38:26.084
No go.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.127
Stay.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.641
Okay, okay.
But what about these beers, man?

38:29.720 --> 38:33.040
If we don't drink them, they'll be onto us,
and I'm not sure I'm ready for beer yet.

38:33.080 --> 38:36.004
Wait, let's just dump them
when no one's looking,

38:36.080 --> 38:37.241
then act like we're drunk.

38:37.320 --> 38:38.731
Okay. Good idea.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.484
All right, let's go.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.849
Summertime.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.844
You're sure you want to do this, big man?
No shame in backing down.

38:50.920 --> 38:51.887
- Really?
- Come on!

38:51.960 --> 38:53.007
Come on.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.764
It's a lifelong shame.

38:54.840 --> 38:57.320
You're finally doing Suicide 35.
It's a big day.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.526
What are you scared of, man?

38:58.600 --> 39:01.524
You're the "rope from the tree,
triple flip, bird-crush" guy.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.921
I'm not scared of this.
In the past, I did it before.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.081
But I'll do it right now.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.161
Sure. Sure. Go ahead.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.328
Do it. Do it.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.728
But the thing is this, I just...

39:11.800 --> 39:13.370
I ate about 45 minutes ago.

39:13.440 --> 39:14.680
What did you eat?

39:14.760 --> 39:16.046
I had chicken chow mein.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.929
Chicken chow mein? When did...

39:18.040 --> 39:19.451
We were with you the whole time!

39:19.520 --> 39:21.321
Yeah. You didn't see it?
They had it at Kmart.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.691
- They have chicken chow...
- Get out of here.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.046
- It's good there. Yeah.
- It's very good.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.406
What do I hear right now?

39:26.680 --> 39:27.886
Look at this.

39:27.960 --> 39:31.806
Beers on ice. Hot ladies everywhere.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.008
This is how we used to do it.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.765
- This is how I still do it, buddy.
- He does still do it that way.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.171
Well, you should stop.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.362
This is Kappa Eta Sigma property.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.970
So you might want to quit
perving on our ladies

39:44.040 --> 39:46.042
and get back to your trailer homes.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.407
Okay, easy there, Abercrombie.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.005
I think it's...

39:50.080 --> 39:51.969
I think we've been around
a little longer than you.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.644
Been swimming here
since we were eight years old,

39:53.720 --> 39:55.484
so you can calm down a little bit.

39:55.640 --> 39:57.290
I'm sure it was the bomb!

39:57.440 --> 40:00.444
Cranking your Al Jolson tunes
on your transistor radio.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.568
But it's the 21st century now.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.563
And Thicky-Thick and the Flabby Bunch

40:04.640 --> 40:06.608
should never take their shirts off again.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.762
- That hurts.
- Okay, I guess I'm Thicky-Thick.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.888
Yeah, well, I don't like being
in the Flabby Bunch, either.

40:10.960 --> 40:13.566
Boom! That just happened.

40:13.680 --> 40:16.445
I haven't been around this many
arrogant white college kids

40:16.520 --> 40:18.045
since Eminem played Duke.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.565
There it goes. And then...

40:19.640 --> 40:20.801
Boom!

40:20.880 --> 40:22.450
That just happened. How was that?

40:22.520 --> 40:25.763
At least we got into college,
skinny Danny Glover.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.241
- Long handjob.
- That's Rock, Paper, Scissors.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.645
I think it's over.

40:38.720 --> 40:40.290
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What, what, what?

40:40.360 --> 40:41.566
What?

40:42.880 --> 40:44.325
And a little extra right there.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.449
Hey, fellows, that was a good handshake.
We got a good one, too. it goes like this.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.124
- Okay, here we go.
- How you doing, sir?

40:49.200 --> 40:51.009
Nice to see you. Very good, sir.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.525
- Beautiful day.
- Yeah, at least we're not stuck

40:52.600 --> 40:56.161
in some crap town like this, hanging
up drywall for the rest of our lives.

40:56.240 --> 40:57.844
Bay-com!

40:57.920 --> 40:59.251
Hanging drywall? First of all,

40:59.320 --> 41:00.731
I'll have you know that I own pretty much

41:00.800 --> 41:02.802
the greatest auto body shop
in town, all right?

41:02.880 --> 41:04.723
This guy works for the cable company.

41:04.800 --> 41:06.006
Free cable for life.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.206
What?

41:07.280 --> 41:08.691
Over here, you know Higgins?

41:08.760 --> 41:11.161
That's right, he works part-time
down at the go-kart track.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.601
So he was highballing you with the drywall.

41:15.280 --> 41:16.850
Boom!

41:18.440 --> 41:20.010
This just got real.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.407
- Real stupid? What happened?
- Something's real.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.327
- Yeah...
- Dougie, Dougie...

41:32.400 --> 41:34.846
Are you guys as wasted as us?

41:34.920 --> 41:37.810
Hells, yeah! All the time!

41:39.520 --> 41:43.286
Yo, we're gonna let you guys
continue your Klan meeting in a minute.

41:43.360 --> 41:45.840
He's just gonna jump off of here,
and then we'll leave.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.365
I can't permit that.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.124
I can't permit it!

41:51.200 --> 41:53.089
Can't permit it.

41:53.160 --> 41:56.084
You guys have ruined
our celebration by being here.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.521
Look at my hands, huh?

41:58.600 --> 41:59.965
They're shaking, I'm so mad.

42:00.040 --> 42:01.644
Yeah, look, my brother's shaking.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.283
- That was a cool move.
- Now, listen to me.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.203
I'm gonna kick this kid's ass.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.647
But I need, like, 11 to 15
minutes to stretch out, okay?

42:11.720 --> 42:12.881
I got to stretch. It's overlooked.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.485
No, I understand.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.210
I can't fight these kids.
I'm skinny Danny Glover.

42:16.280 --> 42:20.126
Guys, this guy's doing 11 flips
behind you for some unknown reason.

42:21.800 --> 42:24.963
We got kids, we can't afford to do this.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.724
Buddy, dude,
you don't have to do that last flip.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.928
Don't, like, get hurt.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.206
We'll come back another time.

42:30.280 --> 42:31.566
You will come back never!

42:31.640 --> 42:33.722
This is Kappa Eta Sigma property!

42:33.800 --> 42:36.087
Dude, why are you acting so crazy?

42:36.160 --> 42:39.050
Did Betty White just call you crazy?

42:39.160 --> 42:40.286
- Did he just call you Betty White?
- Betty White?

42:40.360 --> 42:41.361
That's pretty funny.

42:41.440 --> 42:42.805
We've got a situation!

42:54.160 --> 42:55.571
You know what? Hey, guys? Guys?

42:55.640 --> 42:57.210
- Hey, what's up, guys?
- Let's get out of here.

42:57.280 --> 42:58.441
Listen, it's nice to meet everybody.

42:58.520 --> 43:00.761
- We're gonna take off, but let's do this again.
- Take care, guys.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.171
- Enjoy yourself.
- Not that way.

43:02.240 --> 43:04.561
Is there an elevator?

43:06.080 --> 43:07.969
That way.

43:08.640 --> 43:12.531
Come on, are you serious?
You gonna make us jump?

43:13.000 --> 43:15.002
Naked.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.967
Asshole.

43:25.160 --> 43:27.208
You guys are losers.

43:35.680 --> 43:38.206
Don't worry, it gets bigger.

43:43.200 --> 43:45.168
That poor old lady!

43:47.440 --> 43:48.930
Rm Paralyzed!

43:49.000 --> 43:51.287
I'm in so much pain!

43:51.360 --> 43:53.249
Mama!

43:56.200 --> 43:58.328
No!

44:04.360 --> 44:06.249
I was inside you!

44:12.640 --> 44:16.565
I can't believe nobody's even
scared of a black guy anymore!

44:16.640 --> 44:18.768
Damn you, Obama!

44:18.840 --> 44:21.889
What the hell just happened?

44:21.960 --> 44:24.566
I saw my dad's dick.

44:41.760 --> 44:45.731
Well, the good news is
Lamonsoff finally did the jump for real.

44:45.800 --> 44:48.007
And the bad news is he landed on my face.

44:48.120 --> 44:50.168
What are you, made of rocks, dude?

44:50.240 --> 44:52.686
Check this out, feel this.
I'm not kidding you.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.046
Right up here.

44:54.120 --> 44:55.087
I think even higher.

44:55.160 --> 44:56.161
- Feel that.
- And?

44:56.240 --> 44:57.401
Put your hand right there.

44:57.480 --> 44:59.209
Feel the other one. Those are my balls.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.123
I'm not kidding you,
they went way up in there.

45:01.200 --> 45:02.361
You're getting me turned on.

45:02.440 --> 45:04.522
Are you kidding me?

45:04.600 --> 45:05.647
What?

45:05.720 --> 45:07.051
They slashed our tires!

45:07.120 --> 45:08.531
These kids won't stop abusing us!

45:08.640 --> 45:09.766
Damn you!

45:09.960 --> 45:12.964
This wasn't college kids.

45:13.040 --> 45:15.646
It was my son, Satan.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.128
And why is this kid so angry?

45:18.200 --> 45:21.170
His mom hiccupped a lot, but she was happy!
And hot.

45:21.400 --> 45:23.402
If she's so hot,

45:23.480 --> 45:26.165
why don't you make her
your late-night booty call?

45:26.240 --> 45:28.766
Beefcakes! Come on, baby!

45:31.960 --> 45:34.804
You've been sneaking around with Fabio?

45:34.880 --> 45:37.326
It's not funny, dude!
She's gonna kick the crap out of me later!

45:37.400 --> 45:40.085
Wow.

45:40.160 --> 45:42.481
- A little five-hour Energy, huh?
- Yeah.

45:44.320 --> 45:45.890
500-hour Energy?

45:45.960 --> 45:47.405
I drink it for the taste, okay?

45:47.480 --> 45:50.563
Oh, my God, you gonna jog
to Florida after this?

45:54.360 --> 45:55.361
No!

45:55.480 --> 45:56.686
A bonus!

45:56.760 --> 45:58.524
Come on, just cram yourself in there.

45:58.600 --> 46:01.604
My body, it's just too big for this thing.
I can't fit.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.921
Higgins, dummy, hop in
this thing for a minute.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.287
- For what?
- Just get in the tire.

46:06.360 --> 46:08.283
- No way! In there?
- Five yards we'll roll you.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.727
We've done it.
I would do it if I could get in there.

46:10.800 --> 46:12.450
This is peer pressure, you're bullying.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.091
And I promise you
I'll stop you and I love you.

46:15.160 --> 46:17.242
Don't let him do it.
He's jacked up on juice.

46:17.320 --> 46:19.368
And a-one, and a-two...

46:19.440 --> 46:21.522
- Mommy's got you.
- ...and a-three!

46:22.800 --> 46:24.290
- Okay, five feet. Grab me.
- Y'ello.

46:24.360 --> 46:25.964
- Lenny!
- Hey, Keithie.

46:26.040 --> 46:28.247
Meet me at the football field,
but don't tell your mother.

46:28.320 --> 46:29.970
Why am I still rolling?

46:30.040 --> 46:31.644
Lenny!

46:31.720 --> 46:33.370
Help!

46:33.440 --> 46:35.090
Guys, get me!

46:35.160 --> 46:37.481
- Hang in there!
- I'm going downhill!

46:37.560 --> 46:38.641
Lenny! No! No!

46:40.320 --> 46:42.971
When will it end?

46:47.520 --> 46:50.285
Yeah. Summer is here, man!

46:56.040 --> 46:59.203
Help! Stop! No!

47:01.160 --> 47:02.161
Tire on the loose!

47:02.240 --> 47:03.730
Fluzoo, shotgun, now!

47:06.760 --> 47:07.841
Someone!

47:07.920 --> 47:09.570
Higgins is in the tire!

47:09.680 --> 47:11.011
Of course.

47:11.080 --> 47:12.684
- Help!
- Get there!

47:12.760 --> 47:14.250
Help!

47:14.320 --> 47:16.402
- Liar!
- No, no, baby!

47:17.560 --> 47:20.848
No! No! Someone!

47:31.080 --> 47:33.162
Shaw's over, tire.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.327
I'm next.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.084
- I got next!
- No, I'm next!

47:51.920 --> 47:53.160
It's my tire! My turn!

47:53.240 --> 47:55.004
Hey!

47:55.080 --> 47:56.809
What happened?

47:57.240 --> 47:58.526
I got a phone call.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.531
Okay. I forgive you.

48:02.600 --> 48:04.807
Was it long-distance or something?

48:04.880 --> 48:06.848
Don't want to kick a guy
while he's down, Higgins,

48:06.920 --> 48:09.127
but we caught your son
with a can of spray paint

48:09.240 --> 48:11.208
looking like he was up to no good.

48:11.280 --> 48:13.886
You lied about the soup.

48:13.960 --> 48:16.406
You lied about the soup!

48:30.920 --> 48:35.369
We are gonna find those fartheads,

48:35.760 --> 48:38.127
and we are gonna kill them.

48:38.360 --> 48:39.930
Kill!

48:40.000 --> 48:43.641
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

48:47.480 --> 48:50.563
No, guys! Not each other!

48:50.640 --> 48:53.450
We're not killing each other!

48:53.600 --> 48:56.570
K-E-I-T

48:56.640 --> 48:59.450
H-I-E.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.682
Keithie, Keithie, Keithie!

49:01.760 --> 49:05.128
It's a practice, Donna.
You don't have to go full speed.

49:05.200 --> 49:06.440
Sorry, Mr. Feder.

49:06.520 --> 49:07.646
It's fine!

49:07.720 --> 49:10.200
Hey, look at these giant mooses out there.

49:13.720 --> 49:15.802
You don't want to get
in the middle of all that.

49:15.880 --> 49:19.441
Plus, the kicker, honestly, is like,
one of the most important guys on the team

49:19.560 --> 49:22.484
and you don't have to worry about getting
your head bashed in every play.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.483
I get it, Dad. I'm a wimp.

49:24.560 --> 49:25.641
You're not a wimp.

49:25.720 --> 49:26.926
It's just common sense.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.843
Avoid big idiots trying to hurt you.

49:29.440 --> 49:32.330
I was trying to avoid a big idiot
trying to hurt me on the bus this morning,

49:32.400 --> 49:33.731
but he wouldn't leave me alone.

49:33.800 --> 49:35.723
Well, sometimes they
won't let you avoid them,

49:35.800 --> 49:38.326
and you just...
You can't back down in those situations.

49:38.400 --> 49:40.368
I'm telling you, I've
backed down a few times,

49:40.440 --> 49:41.566
it's not a good feeling.

49:41.640 --> 49:43.529
All right, look, let's just
kick a few field goals.

49:43.600 --> 49:45.284
It's like soccer, which you're great at.

49:45.360 --> 49:48.204
All you got to do is put your
foot right through the ball.

49:51.400 --> 49:52.367
What?

49:52.440 --> 49:53.646
Touchdown! Yeah!

49:53.760 --> 49:55.364
Yeah!

49:55.440 --> 49:57.522
That's ridiculous! Your first try?

49:57.640 --> 49:59.608
All right, we're backing up, boy.

49:59.680 --> 50:02.251
That was totally awesome, Keithie!
That was so cool!

50:02.320 --> 50:04.607
That was just, like, awesome!

50:04.760 --> 50:06.569
Okay, drive through the ball.

50:06.640 --> 50:08.210
Drive through the ball.

50:10.280 --> 50:11.327
It's up!

50:11.760 --> 50:14.366
Yeah! Go, Keithie!

50:14.440 --> 50:17.410
Yes! What did you eat this morning?

50:17.480 --> 50:21.121
All right, this is starting to
get into, like, college level.

50:21.200 --> 50:22.645
From the 30!

50:22.720 --> 50:24.404
Who the hell is this kid?

50:30.440 --> 50:31.885
Oh, my God!

50:31.960 --> 50:33.530
<i>Stop! Keithie time!</i>

50:35.800 --> 50:39.043
I'm starting to think
she has a little crush on you.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.201
Really?

50:40.280 --> 50:42.851
Either that or she got bit
by a poisonous spider.

50:42.920 --> 50:45.002
Keithie!

50:46.200 --> 50:49.170
All right, let's see how you do
in a real game situation, though.

50:49.240 --> 50:51.686
Okay? Let's pretend I'm a linebacker,

50:51.760 --> 50:53.410
and I'm gonna come at you
and try and block it.

50:53.480 --> 50:54.481
Okay.

50:54.560 --> 50:55.891
Set!

50:57.080 --> 50:59.003
Hike! I'm a crazy linebacker!

50:59.080 --> 51:00.081
Give me that football!

51:02.640 --> 51:04.324
My leg!

51:04.400 --> 51:05.640
Keithie!

51:05.720 --> 51:07.722
Don't tell your mother!

51:07.800 --> 51:11.168
All right, that kid's dead. Back to work.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.446
Now, you remember how to do
a five-point turn, right?

51:14.520 --> 51:15.601
Yeah.

51:15.680 --> 51:17.569
- Parallel park?
- Yeah, yeah.

51:17.640 --> 51:19.688
Hey, don't "yeah, yeah" me, dumb-ass.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.250
You're precious cargo.

51:21.320 --> 51:23.200
Now, if you mess around
and get yourself killed,

51:23.280 --> 51:24.247
I'm gonna have to kill you.

51:24.320 --> 51:26.004
Look, Dad, I'm ready for this, all right?

51:27.960 --> 51:29.450
You're late.

51:30.680 --> 51:31.920
Hello, McKenzie.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.684
Hey, Wiley, how you feeling?

51:36.160 --> 51:37.924
Just two years of this.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.083
And I still only have
40% feeling in my body.

51:41.200 --> 51:43.123
Otherwise, I'm fine.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.929
No, Rihanna's fine.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.525
You just teach driver's ed.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.125
Get her done, son!

51:49.200 --> 51:51.407
And remember everything we talked about!

51:51.480 --> 51:52.720
Defensive driving!

51:52.800 --> 51:53.961
Stop at all yellows!

51:54.040 --> 51:55.121
Obey the laws!

51:56.200 --> 51:58.646
- You moron!
- Look out!

51:58.760 --> 52:01.684
Be safe! Don't do what I just did!

52:02.400 --> 52:04.641
Hey, officers, you guys
want to stick around

52:04.720 --> 52:06.404
and have a drink with me,
hang out a little bit?

52:06.480 --> 52:08.767
You're afraid of us leaving you
alone with your son, aren't you?

52:08.840 --> 52:10.888
My son... Are you kidding me?
I don't care...

52:10.960 --> 52:13.088
- Boo!
- He's got a knife!

52:13.720 --> 52:16.849
That sounds dangerous.
How far was the drop?

52:16.920 --> 52:18.809
Just 35 feet.

52:18.880 --> 52:21.360
Who do you think you are, Tarzan?

52:21.440 --> 52:23.329
- It's no big deal.
- Honey?

52:23.400 --> 52:25.164
Hi, Sally.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.004
Hi, honey. I... No, I just came to see

52:27.120 --> 52:28.201
if Mommy was alive.

52:28.280 --> 52:29.805
And looking now,

52:29.880 --> 52:31.166
she's breathing, she's good.

52:31.240 --> 52:32.844
Hi. What are you doing here?

52:32.960 --> 52:35.008
I was bringing your mother
a new fan for the summer.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.320
- That's good.
- You said you couldn't

52:36.400 --> 52:37.890
get coffee with me because you had

52:37.960 --> 52:40.850
a 3:30 appointment with a Mr. Renaldo.

52:40.920 --> 52:42.160
<i>Hello, ladies!</i>

52:42.240 --> 52:43.844
<i>You!</i>

52:43.920 --> 52:44.921
<i>Can't be!</i>

52:45.000 --> 52:47.241
<i>We killed you. Last week.</i>

52:47.320 --> 52:50.767
<i>You actually think two amateurish nitwits</i>

52:50.840 --> 52:54.083
<i>could kill The Great Renaldo?</i>

52:54.440 --> 52:55.771
I told you.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.923
You did. You called it.

53:03.320 --> 53:06.005
So the leg's not really broken, huh?

53:06.320 --> 53:08.561
No, it is broken, right here.

53:08.640 --> 53:11.325
Just a hairline fracture, though.

53:11.400 --> 53:13.164
No, it's a clean break.

53:13.240 --> 53:14.685
Slight, though.

53:14.760 --> 53:17.331
Slight? No. It's broken.

53:17.400 --> 53:20.085
Broken-broken or just broken?

53:20.160 --> 53:22.731
It's a broken leg.

53:22.800 --> 53:26.407
What was once one bone
is now two half-bones.

53:26.480 --> 53:27.606
Right.

53:27.680 --> 53:32.288
Is there anything you can do
about my wife staring at me?

53:34.280 --> 53:36.726
No, I'm not a psychiatrist.

53:36.800 --> 53:38.370
So you're saying my wife is crazy?

53:38.440 --> 53:40.010
No, no. I was joking.

53:40.080 --> 53:41.889
Like you were when you said
his leg is broken.

53:41.960 --> 53:43.610
Look, your son

53:43.680 --> 53:46.923
is going to be wearing
that cast the entire summer.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.891
If you don't mind, I
haven't slept in 68 hours.

53:50.960 --> 53:53.247
So you're a little loopy
from lack of sleep,

53:53.320 --> 53:54.890
and that really isn't my son's bone.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.923
That's a piece of celery you snapped.

53:57.000 --> 53:57.967
- Lenny!
- Yes?

53:58.040 --> 53:59.565
The leg is broken!

54:03.200 --> 54:04.929
You can't undo this,

54:05.000 --> 54:08.243
and you lied to me,
so you're gonna pay for it.

54:08.320 --> 54:12.928
Doctor, wouldn't it be nice
if there was a cure for anger?

54:13.000 --> 54:14.081
There is.

54:14.160 --> 54:15.844
It's called Jack Daniel's.

54:16.880 --> 54:18.450
Another one of your jokes, huh?

54:18.520 --> 54:20.010
I Wish.

54:22.640 --> 54:24.640
Okay, the light is red now,
so just remain stopped.

54:28.520 --> 54:30.045
Scully, is that you?

54:31.880 --> 54:33.166
Scully!

54:34.840 --> 54:36.604
Hey, what's up, fellas?

54:36.680 --> 54:39.126
Are you taking your driver's test drunk?

54:39.200 --> 54:41.282
Yeah, I'm MC Hammered!

54:41.360 --> 54:43.010
- You're a madman!
- Psychopath, man!

54:43.080 --> 54:44.081
Hey, Scully, Scully.

54:44.160 --> 54:46.401
Have you seen those old townies
from the quarry today?

54:46.480 --> 54:49.484
No, I can't say I did. Why?

54:49.560 --> 54:51.642
They disrespected our frat house!

54:51.720 --> 54:53.245
Man, they disrespected the crap out of it!

54:53.320 --> 54:54.890
No, can't have that.

54:57.160 --> 54:58.446
Brewski time, dude!

54:58.520 --> 54:59.965
It's not for you, Scully.

55:00.040 --> 55:01.804
It's for that freak in the hat next to you.

55:01.880 --> 55:03.006
Looks like he needs it.

55:03.080 --> 55:04.081
- Boom!
- Yeah!

55:04.160 --> 55:05.491
That just happened!

55:05.560 --> 55:07.688
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

55:09.800 --> 55:13.486
Taking your driver's
test while intoxicated?

55:15.080 --> 55:17.447
Minus five points.

55:26.040 --> 55:27.644
This is ridiculous!

55:27.760 --> 55:31.367
I've wasted an entire day
waiting for this idiot to show up.

55:31.440 --> 55:34.125
Did you tell him your son-in-law
works for the cable company?

55:34.200 --> 55:38.000
A fat lot of good being related
to that bozo would do me.

55:38.080 --> 55:41.050
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.

55:41.120 --> 55:42.690
Love to the children.

55:49.080 --> 55:50.525
Yes. Yes.

55:57.120 --> 55:59.361
Damn it, I just sat down.

55:59.440 --> 56:01.522
I'll be right out there!

56:01.600 --> 56:02.681
Hang on!

56:02.760 --> 56:04.364
I'm coming as quick as I can.

56:04.440 --> 56:06.283
I got bunions, damn it!

56:14.040 --> 56:15.963
No! No!

56:16.040 --> 56:18.122
You burn in hell!

56:18.240 --> 56:20.049
You cable-installing mother...

56:20.120 --> 56:21.485
Damn it!

56:30.560 --> 56:31.561
Look, man,

56:31.640 --> 56:33.881
I know deadbeat dads
always have lame excuses

56:33.960 --> 56:36.167
why they don't see their kids,

56:36.240 --> 56:39.687
but "I didn't know you existed
till about a week ago"

56:39.760 --> 56:41.808
is actually a fantastic excuse.

56:41.880 --> 56:43.405
So can you cut me some slack?

56:43.480 --> 56:45.244
Her name's not Hiccups McGee.

56:45.320 --> 56:47.049
Yeah, I know that.

56:47.120 --> 56:48.724
So why do you call her that?

56:48.840 --> 56:51.366
No, that's just... It's stupid.

56:51.440 --> 56:55.240
It's just kind of a nickname
I give people that,

56:55.320 --> 56:58.767
you know, have a distinct
trait or physical feature.

56:58.840 --> 57:02.322
Like, if someone had big lips,
you'd call them Lippy McGee.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.926
And if they sneezed a lot,
you'd call them Sneezy McGee.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.924
So you'd be Ugly McGee.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.162
I'd be Ugly McGee. Exactly.

57:10.280 --> 57:11.566
Shorty McGee.

57:11.640 --> 57:12.607
Shorty McGee, sure.

57:12.680 --> 57:13.920
Viagra McGee.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.480
Right, right. You get it, you get it.

57:15.560 --> 57:17.449
Listen, man,

57:17.520 --> 57:20.091
I'm willing to give this a try if you are.

57:21.720 --> 57:24.451
You know what they say...
Yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery.

57:26.280 --> 57:31.241
Maybe we go inside and search the Internet
for funny videos of squirrels waterskiing.

57:40.720 --> 57:42.927
Okay, we're getting somewhere.

57:43.400 --> 57:45.289
I'm sorry I lied about the appointment.

57:45.360 --> 57:47.408
The lying's not the worst part.

57:47.480 --> 57:49.562
You hid from me at your
mother's house, Eric.

57:49.640 --> 57:50.971
Who does that?

57:51.040 --> 57:52.565
Look, she's nice to me.

57:52.880 --> 57:55.042
You know, she always takes my side,

57:55.120 --> 57:58.044
worries if I'm eating enough
and taking my vitamins.

57:58.160 --> 58:00.208
I do all that stuff, too, Eric.

58:00.600 --> 58:02.443
Okay, I don't.

58:02.520 --> 58:03.806
You're right.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.484
You know, there's only
so many hours in a day,

58:05.560 --> 58:08.166
and I'm always running around the kids,

58:08.240 --> 58:10.288
and I guess I leave you out a lot,

58:10.400 --> 58:12.641
and I'm really gonna try harder
to make you feel special,

58:12.720 --> 58:15.485
'cause you always make me feel
like the only girl in the world.

58:15.560 --> 58:17.881
I feel bad.

58:17.960 --> 58:19.200
Don't feel bad.

58:19.280 --> 58:21.726
No, I do, because today at the recital,

58:21.800 --> 58:26.124
I couldn't stop looking at Becky's teacher.

58:26.240 --> 58:27.969
I don't mind you looking.

58:28.120 --> 58:30.122
I really don't. Everybody looks.

58:30.440 --> 58:32.568
I was looking today.

58:32.640 --> 58:34.529
And I'm totally fine with that.

58:34.600 --> 58:37.046
As long as he was gay, dead or a cartoon.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.610
- Gay.
- Okay.

58:38.840 --> 58:43.402
But no matter who or what we look at, we'll
always come back to each other, right?

58:45.440 --> 58:46.851
- Car wash!
- Car wash!

58:46.960 --> 58:48.405
- Support our team!
- I'll prove it to you!

58:48.480 --> 58:50.528
Car wash!

58:50.600 --> 58:53.171
- What are you doing?
- No, no, you're gonna like this.

58:53.720 --> 58:54.960
Hi, girls!

58:56.760 --> 58:58.489
Come on.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.202
Honey, you don't have to do this.

59:02.280 --> 59:03.247
I want to.

59:03.320 --> 59:05.209
Hi, girls!

59:05.280 --> 59:07.203
Wash it up extra soapy!

59:07.280 --> 59:09.203
You got it.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.567
Wait, hang on.
There's a car just in front of you.

59:11.640 --> 59:12.641
Better do them first.

59:12.720 --> 59:13.767
Yo, got a customer!

59:13.840 --> 59:16.411
You take these guys,
we'll take the yellow car.

59:16.480 --> 59:18.528
Extra soapy.

59:22.800 --> 59:24.609
What is happening right now?

59:27.640 --> 59:30.166
I swear, I didn't plan this.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.731
No, no, no, no. Thank you. I'm good.
I'm good, thank you.

59:38.800 --> 59:41.007
Well, I might as well enjoy this.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.287
Why is this never-ending?

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.330
At least the guys in the car
in front of us are having fun.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.240
What are you doing? Get in there!

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.651
Let me do it.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.369
Okay, everybody.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.250
It wasn't a perfect day. I admit it.
There were some downs.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.049
Sorry about the leg.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.565
The good news is

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.688
the children got through
another year of school.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:01.847
Fabulously.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.844
You got older, even though I told you not to.
Especially you.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.684
Stay young. Don't leave me.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.162
You prepared us your famous
chicken a la food poisoning,

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.526
which we're all excited to eat.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.046
I'm just kidding.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.361
But the greatest thing is,
it's my favorite part of the day

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.566
with my four best friends.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.926
To the Feders!

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.611
So Bumpty asked me out for ice cream today.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.844
I "went out for ice cream" once
with your dad.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.129
Nine months later, Andre popped out.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.401
This is the best vanilla
pudding I've ever had.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.767
That's butter, son.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.361
Here you go.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.046
- Hey.
- Want me to come in and feed it to you

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.202
like I did the last time?

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.521
No, no. I got my kid here.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.721
That wouldn't be cool.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.280
You said you loved me!

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.284
They're not all tens, buddy.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.289
Homeboy, why aren't you eating?

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.045
I saw something today
that made me lose my appetite.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.851
What was it, me naked?

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.244
What?

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.890
What's a burpsmart?

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.086
Burpsnorp?

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.650
A burpsnart!

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.929
Basically, he burps, sneezes
and farts at the same time.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.047
He goes...

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.401
I think I just shat myself.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.245
Hey, honey, what time's
that Feder bash tonight?

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.970
What?

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.166
It's paint.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.651
It doesn't come off.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.087
I thought it might be fun
to have a theme, no?

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.766
- A theme?
- Roxanne decided the theme is...

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.686
The '80s?

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.808
That was 70 years ago.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.924
I thought we could go as Hall & Oates.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:51.967
Hall & Oates?

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.127
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.009
What is that, like a cereal?

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.525
No.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.604
Why don't you ask Nancy Arbuckle
to come by for the get-together?

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.570
Or do you prefer
the imaginary shower version?

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.767
You know what, Charlotte? I trust you,

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.524
and I want you to have fun tonight.

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.965
Really.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.885
What's up, player?
I'm here for your daughter.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.207
What...

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:28.565
Used to get 10 cases of beer for my
parties, now I get 10 cases of juice boxes.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.405
Hey, Beckster.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.164
- Hey, Stud Muffin.
- Hey.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.562
Mommy calls him Stud Muffin,
so I call him Stud Muffin.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.687
Is that right?

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.331
You must be Roxanne's husband. I'm Kyle.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.641
How do you know my wife
again there, Mud Stuffing?

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.563
I worked her out this morning.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.641
Really?

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.326
I worked her out this morning,
too, pretty good.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.841
All right.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.843
Hi.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.046
What's up?

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.690
This is awkward.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.842
My husband's here.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.570
Why is that awkward?

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.324
Why?

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.129
Well, let me give you a hint.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.808
You have brain damage?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.367
I think we both know
what time it is, don't we?

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.771
What time is it?

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.842
Nothing.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:16.766
It's just... Just time to...

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.524
Help me out here.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.570
I'm lost right now. I'm sorry.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.529
Wiley, how'd Andre McKenzie do?

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.601
Did he pass his test?

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.125
He squeaked by.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.328
We didn't check out any soapy cheerleaders.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.084
What's going on with you and my wife?

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.161
I'm gonna go.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.571
Actually, why don't we all
go our separate ways.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.961
I don't see any of these conversations
working out for me.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.365
- Adios.
- I'll see you tonight.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.407
Hey-

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.641
I'll bring the Hubba Bubba.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.641
What?

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.768
Yeah, party tonight '80s-style, huh?

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.649
<i>Rocky Ill.</i>

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.961
- Wiley!
- Okay.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.764
Hey, babe.

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.966
What does Penny's note say?

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.084
She wrote, "Mayonnaise, zitis..."

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.400
The other side.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.561
"Meet me by your mailbox at 11:00."

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.007
Why would I meet her
by my mailbox at 11:00?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.321
You have any idea what just happened there?

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.686
Not a clue.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.161
I don't care who your parents are.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.844
You screw up, I fire you.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.048
It's all good.

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.167
"It's all good"?

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.481
It's a family restaurant, not a rap show.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.130
It's all bad?

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.089
That's right, it is.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.525
You got a customer.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.604
I'm sorry. Welcome to the Ice Cream House.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.330
Hi, Greg.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.209
Nancy, hi.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.045
I think you crushed your cones.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.281
No.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.771
That was a... That was a squeeze test.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.444
These cones failed.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.204
We're gonna try cardboard cones next.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.241
You're smiling.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.285
And number two.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.362
You have such a nice smile.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.124
Thanks.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.124
Go out with me tonight before
your friends say I'm fugly.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.282
Tonight?

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.441
Sure.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.642
No freaking way.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.885
Your father used to do
that same three-step crap

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.291
when we were growing up.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.641
It always worked then.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.529
Even on my wife.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.484
I ain't no boy with a mind you can toy,

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.484
'cause if this is a ploy,
I'll destroy Illinois.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.325
It is so amazing how you can
freestyle like that.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.370
I been laying it down
truthful since day one.

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.410
Well, I sing sometimes, too,

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.608
but only, like, in the shower.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.688
I'm scared to sing in
front of other people.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.764
If you scared, that means you don't got it.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:44.322
Sorry to be blunt, but I don't front.
I'm hard-core.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.484
Dinosaur!

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.527
How long ago was the '80s?

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.365
That was way back in the 1900s.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.646
We learned about it in school.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:58.767
It was wack.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.844
The phones had long, curly
things coming out of the end.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.570
You had to watch commercials.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.721
No way.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.131
Isn't that right, Bowser?

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.969
How we doing?

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.361
Hey, Dad, why do we have to
wear costumes and you don't?

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.805
I am wearing a costume.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.611
Bruce Springsteen, Born in the U. S.A.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.329
Who's Bruce Springsteen?

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.368
I guess some guy with a giant butt.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.569
You don't know who the Boss is?

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.165
I stink as a father.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.242
You do not stink as a father.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.163
You're the best father I know.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.607
That's why I don't understand
why you don't...

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.727
Why I don't want a baby?

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.280
Because I don't want one!
Let's move on from that!

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.920
No. No, no.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.804
Tell her it wasn't you talking, Dad.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.484
It was your flabby ass.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:53.042
You want me to "accidentally"
break the other leg?

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.247
Hey, I'm sorry I raised my voice.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.924
In front of the children!

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.570
Right, in front of the kids.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.880
It's just, you...

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.611
All you're doing is bringing up this
baby thing over and over.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.125
Are you going through, like,

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:15.250
a "womany" hormone
situation or something?

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.089
Menopause?

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.127
What, you're not old enough for that?
I'm sorry.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.924
Okay, no, I meant schizophrenia.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.287
No, honey, honey, honey,

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.330
if we have another baby,
we're starting over, you know?

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:27.890
How about we just adopt a kid?

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.281
Like a 20-year-old who has a job.

01:08:29.319 --> 01:08:30.921
That way we could make money off of him.

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:35.768
I just... Don't you think
we can start concentrating on me and you?

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.406
That's all I'm saying. It's our time.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:43.087
Well, I am going through
kind of a hormone thing.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.447
Good, there's pills for that.

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.969
I'm pregnant.

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:54.408
Our guests are here.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.009
Wait a minute, when did we even have...

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.724
Damn you, Motel 6 hot tub!

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.564
Wow. Lenny, that's big, brother.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.165
Yeah, four kids is the best.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.651
What are you talking about, Prince?

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.768
You told me it would be
the worst if that happened.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.848
There's a lot of great aspects to that.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.527
Like, when Junior graduates high school,
you'll be 64.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.930
How is that a good thing?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.729
Actually, it's horrifying.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.723
I didn't do the math
before I opened my mouth. Sorry.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.881
Nice job, Cher.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.006
Okay, I'm not Cher.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.162
I'm Meat Loaf, all right? Yeah.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.970
You're Meat Loaf,
or you're made of meat loaf?

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.279
Who are you, Doug Henning?

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:38.163
I'm Oates.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.241
Where's Hall?

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:41.680
Hall's having a playdate with your kids.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.848
Anyway, you got nothing
to worry about, Lenny.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.120
All right? You're a great dad.

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.649
Right, I know. I broke my son's leg today.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:50.881
That's a real good dad.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.645
Guys, you're bumming me out, all right?
This is supposed to be party time.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.690
This isn't gonna be a real party.
I'm drinking a juice box,

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:59.969
'cause I'm afraid my wife's gonna yell at
me for getting drunk in front of the kids.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.249
How many of you guys have been to a party
in the past six months?

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.289
A party without a bouncy house.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.609
A party where they actually invited you.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.161
Yeah.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.686
The party's over, fellas.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.808
You saw the way those frat guys
treated us today.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.245
We're irrelevant.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.560
We're losers.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.687
We're old.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.125
Lamonsoff totally surrendered.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.043
He's got a fanny pack on now,
for God's sake.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.770
You know what, first of all,

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.411
it's a "survanny" pack,
a survival fanny pack,

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.845
with many special features.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.207
So you pull that triangle
and lasagna comes out?

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.211
Why don't you give it a shot?

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.487
You got it. I'll pull the string.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.522
<i>Like a raft out of hell!</i>

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.888
Yeah, good one, that was good.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.243
Don't ever say the party's over!

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.329
That didn't happen.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.328
Hey, Richard Simmons is a hero.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.402
No, no, no, no, no.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.686
What's with all this Prince?

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.000
- I'm Prince.
- The hell.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.411
You ain't Prince. I'm Prince.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.130
My skin's way lighter than yours.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.090
You should have came as Seal
on a hunger strike.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:30.687
You look like Morgan Freeman
if he was a transvestite.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.411
And what you doing here, Bumpty?
I thought you was out with my daughter.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:35.801
That ain't Bumpty. That's my wife.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.531
Mary! I didn't recognize you.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.886
Where's your costume?

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.884
I didn't find out about the party
until it was too late.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.044
So you decided to come as a black Muppet?

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.767
What?

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:52.847
Come on, you're my one and only,
sweetie-boo-mo-mo.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.647
Make a muscle for me?

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.846
Pwease?

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.408
So bulgy.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:06.325
Like a big caramel apple.

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.084
Wow.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.921
I'm scared. I feel safe with you.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.924
Shut up.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.081
You know, I can make
a connection with a woman.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.367
I just can't sustain it.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.602
You know, there's a distance there.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.885
Try to fill it up pharmaceutically,
you know, with pills,

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.849
or the Discovery Channel,

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.082
or Dino Nuggets.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.124
But nothing really works.

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.443
See, you understand, you know?

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.608
'Cause you're, I heard,

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.606
sensitive to men.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.411
God, he's hot!

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.721
Zip it! He'll find out our secret!

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.327
- Drink up, partner.
- Yeah!

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:16.970
Lenny!

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.809
Secret table.

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.042
Yes, honey, how are you? What's going on?

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.724
We just trying to get our punch on.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.767
Becky's sleepy-

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.888
She wants her daddy to put her to bed.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.725
Well, Daddy's right about
to enjoy some refreshing punch,

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.763
so could you put her to sleep?

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.842
Well, you wouldn't want
to have too much punch

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.241
with all these kids running around.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.850
You know what, I'd be okay with that.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.251
Actually, you wouldn't.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.685
Gotcha.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:42.604
I'll be back soon, fellas.
I'll be back soon. That's a promise.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.250
- Let's go, little girl.
- Good night.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.481
Time to go to sleep.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.524
Close your eyes.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.365
Yeah, Mom.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.367
As easy as making a free throw.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.727
Hey, Bean, Becky went to sleep.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.451
I think it's time for you to hit it, pal.
What do you say?

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.806
No, no, don't touch that.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.325
Yeah, you might break it.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.044
What...

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.929
Where did you learn how to do that?

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.804
I saw it in one of my dreams.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.927
You're a genius?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.287
My boy's a genius.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.690
Your dad's also a genius.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:35.240
Sweet dreams there, angel, okay?

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.449
Daddy, can you lay in bed
with me till I fall asleep?

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.126
What do you mean? I thought you are sleepy.
That's why we came up here.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.567
Please lay down.

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.120
I'll lay down with you, then.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.329
I just... There's a party going on, but...

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.970
Can you tell me a story?

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.644
Look who was in the neighborhood!

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.923
Some of Lenny's friends
from the old J. Geils Band!

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.406
- Daddy?
- You don't want one slug?

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:15.845
No.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.082
I thought you liked this stuff. Sorry.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.209
All right. I'll tell you a story.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:28.202
Once upon a time, there was a hand,

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.803
and the hand faced-raked the child.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.563
Sleep!

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.167
Slee...

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.084
Sleep!

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:45.970
Boy, Feder's cranking
his old rock and roll records pretty loud.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.283
Guess he's never heard of neighbors.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.280
Now, why you stopping here?

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.925
I need some air.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.161
You need some air?

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.891
- We haven't even gotten to the party yet.
- I would appreciate it

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.281
if you would stop trying to "manage" me.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.688
Word, word.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.725
Want me to stay and wait with you?

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.771
I just want to be alone!

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.044
Yo, don't believe the hype.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.122
Boy!

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:28.604
Daddy, I can't fall asleep
without Mr. Gigglesworth.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.081
You told me he would be okay.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.162
He Will be. I...

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.481
He just needs to rest a
little bit longer, okay?

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.883
Please, Daddy. I need to see him.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.321
He had a very rough day.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:48.089
But I'll get him for you,
because you need to see him.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:53.042
Doing leg lifts.
I work out when I can, you know?

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.925
Want some Daddy candy right here?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.968
Why are you naked?

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.565
Global warming.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.320
Why is this empty?

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.845
- Where is Gigglesworth?
- Hey, hey.

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.969
I'm sorry, man. Were you looking for this?

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.280
Why's he look good?

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.646
I sewed him.

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.801
You sew?

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:09.961
Where'd you learn how to sew?

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.121
Gay camp-

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.441
You went to gay camp? You're gay?

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:16.171
No, no. No, I mean, I'm gay,

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.811
but no, there's no such thing
as gay camp, man. it was a joke.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.721
I learned to sew from my dad,
who was a tailor.

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.331
I've been sewing since
I was Becky's age. Here.

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.403
This is great.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.928
Gigglesworth's okay,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.207
you're not fooling around with my wife,

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.520
and you got a pee stain.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.842
That is not mine.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.082
You're an animal.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.770
I am the law!

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.688
Can you dig it?

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.441
Come on, big man,
Lenny's got, like, 12 bathrooms.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.722
I don't got to go to the bathroom.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.450
I'm just enjoying the water.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.928
Get out.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.606
Hurry! Hurry!

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.364
Fluzoo, come on!

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.324
That's not even warm. It's hot.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.402
I got to give it to your
old man for one thing.

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.290
He could always throw a party.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.964
This is my dad's party?

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:55.489
Check out your girlfriend
in the Pat Benatar outfit.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.365
Charlotte,

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:19.766
that was amazing.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.280
Where'd you learn to sing like that?

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.921
No place. I just sing a
little in the shower.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.481
Maybe you should stick to the shower.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.800
<i>'Cause I gots the power</i>

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.326
<i>I'm on Today Show
Dissing Matt Lauer</i>

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.447
Bumpty!

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:36.809
Do me a favor and shut your mouth before
I slap that Mohawk into a chin strap.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.484
What?

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.320
Hey-

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.448
Who invited you guys?

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.881
Your beautiful wife does.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.166
Well, she invited her,

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.164
and naturally, we assumed
it was a plus one.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.801
There a problem?

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.521
No, I was gonna say,
great Terminator outfit

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.410
and Robert Palmer thing you got on, and...

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.404
Nice babble.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.971
- How about this?
- No.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.127
What about that?

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.362
Does that hurt? Is that hurting you?

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.521
Yes, it is hurting me.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.331
Okay. Well, let me do it some more.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.687
You got something to say?

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.450
Actually, Cavanaugh.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.161
You want to stay at my party,
I think you owe me an apology.

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.241
For what?

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:36.210
For back in the day, always giving me crap.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.528
You don't want to let bygones be bygones?

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.809
I do. After you apologize to me.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.049
For stuff I did 30 years ago?

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.681
There isn't a statute
of limitations on being a dick.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.808
What'd you just say?

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.723
I said what I said.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.848
You and me are fighting right now.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.127
Now, let's go! Let's get it over with.

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.527
Man, looks like our friend's about to die.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.489
Lenny, what's going on?
I'm calling the police!

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.171
We're already here.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.246
Hold my hair, woman.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.246
You ready for this?

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:14.085
Not at all, but I'm gonna do this,

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.128
'cause I got to show my son what's right.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.724
We'd do anything for our boys, wouldn't we?

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.211
Absolutely.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.406
Yeah.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.050
My boy's over in Afghanistan.

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.522
Well, you raised him right.
I hope he gets home safe soon.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.045
Yeah, me, too.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.565
Sucker-punch him, Feder.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.009
Lick his bicep. Lick it,
bite it, lick the tan off.

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.688
All right, here's what's gonna happen.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.445
Hit me right on the chin.
I'll go down like a sack of potatoes.

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.761
- What are you talking about?
- Just do it.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:48.320
I know you'd do the same for me
if my boy was watching.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.163
Let's get busy, Hollywood!

01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.885
No! Don't hit me, please!

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.883
I'm sorry. Please don't hit me.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.371
You would tear me limb from limb.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.766
Open this.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.491
The only reason I picked on you
was because I was afraid of you.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.971
- What?
- Oh, my God.

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.042
Please, please, please. Just go with it.

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.440
I didn't think anyone would
believe you could knock me out.

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:17.280
Please. Don't hit me.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.443
Cavanaugh's crying. This is ridiculous!

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.487
Cavanaugh.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.130
You mean you don't
want me to hit you with this?

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.201
No! Please.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.488
Or the elbow?

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.285
Finger in the eye!

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.249
- Wow.
- Listen to this guy!

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.847
All right, get up. Straighten up.

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.969
I'm not gonna hit you,

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:40.963
but if you ever disrespect me

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.849
or anybody,

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.763
I will hunt you down,

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:48.481
and I will slap you into a pile of tattoos,

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.724
bad breath

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.481
and back zits.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.488
Please.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.688
Do you understand me?

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.524
Yes, I understand you.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.206
Do you understand me?

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.726
Yes, I understand you!

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.809
Then walk away before I change my mind.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.291
Thank you very much.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.168
- Hey, man, look at him!
- What just happened?

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.163
Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.483
Oh, my God, that was the
manliest thing you ever did.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.968
You get extra special
hip-hop dance tonight.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.644
Word up.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.528
Hey, guys, if you see Leonard,

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:36.161
could you tell him that I'm here waiting
like we arranged?

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.009
Guys? Guys?

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:43.002
Yeah, okay. Okay, I am a person!

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.043
- That was awesome, by the way.
- Had to. Had to.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.531
Yeah, yeah, you had to.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.204
He let you off the hook, didn't he?

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:51.204
He did, he did, but I had to go With it.

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.603
I can't believe it!

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.882
We hit the moron jackpot!

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:05.249
Everybody who needs a beating,
conveniently together on one lawn.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.810
Who are they?

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.326
Brunson University frat guys.

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:12.171
Oh, God, I hate white people.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.045
Excuse me, why are you here?
What's the matter?

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:18.169
I tell you what is the matter.

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.965
These old townies trashed our frat house!

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.761
And nobody treats our good-times
headquarters with disrespect!

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.888
Yeah!

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.964
They didn't do it.

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.405
Me do it.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.767
Don't try and cover for him, Z-Dog!

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.325
Who's Z-Dog?

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.686
We know they're trying to get back at us

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.041
for making them do the naked
plunge in our swimming hole.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:42.562
Your swimming hole? I've been swimming
at the quarry since I was eight years old.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.081
Apparently, everybody in this crap town

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.970
has been swimming there
since they were eight years old.

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:52.170
I guess nobody wants to leave this dump
because they're too busy sucking!

01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.926
We'll finish later.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.445
- You promise?
- I promise.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.329
- Okay.
- Hey, smart guy!

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.562
Lenny Feder left this town,

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:07.689
moved to Hollywood, made big bucks,

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:10.161
probably more money than
all you brainiacs put together

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.241
ever will.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.526
But guess what?

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.244
He came back here.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:19.042
'Cause this beautiful town is his home.
And it always will be his home.

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:28.365
Well, that was just a moving testament
to this community, bro!

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.604
But we didn't come here
to hear any lame speeches.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:37.288
We came here to kick some old, smelly ass!

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.287
Fellas, we may be old.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.640
We may be smelly.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.722
We may have a penis.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.571
But the only ones getting
their ass kicked around here

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.530
is gonna be you spoiled,

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:01.531
privileged, uppity, preppy D-bags.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:02.806
You hear that?

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.281
Now, let's get busy!

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:27.486
<i>They're dancing on the ceiling</i>

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:30.211
<i>They're dancing on the floor</i>

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.363
<i>People everywhere coming through the door</i>

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:36.523
<i>They know there's a party going on</i>

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.690
Come on, son!

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:48.727
You ain't tough!

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.245
Hit him!

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:55.369
Yeah, Braden! Yeah! Damn!

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.970
You want this?

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.606
Sir, please stop it!

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.921
That's not a sir! That's a woman!

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.128
My woman!

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.402
Come on, babe.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:12.723
<i>I know you're gonna lose control</i>

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.040
<i>You can do</i>

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.043
Oh, you're so hot.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:22.370
<i>I know it's cold outside</i>

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.442
Don't bust my face!

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.490
You saved me.

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.688
I will protect you for
the rest of your life.

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.843
Okay, blow dryer boy.

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.606
Oh, God, no!

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.728
No! No!

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.802
Yeah! Yeah!

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.609
Having a good anniversary, babe?

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.011
Honey, the best.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.931
I can't breathe.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.126
Choking me!

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:05.926
Yeah!

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.809
We did it. We did it, man.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:08.847
Yeah.

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.365
We make a good team.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.965
Yeah. Yeah, that was fun.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.647
<i>I know it's cold outside</i>

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.564
<i>Come on, babe, I'll keep you satisfied</i>

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.766
Boomer!

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.086
What's going on?

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.605
This!

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.490
You're a traitor, Boomer!

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:51.766
His name's not Boomer!

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:54.126
It's Gary.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.361
It's Greg.

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.647
Greg.

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.961
Oh, my God! Did you see his head?

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.769
He's got a... He's bald!

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:12.208
I got a wild one!

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.684
Noogie, noogie, noogie.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.808
Nobody noogies my brother!

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.081
My brain! My brain!

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:28.484
B.U.!

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.050
Hey, man! I had that one.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.724
I know you did, big brother.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.882
- Get out of here!
- Don't hit me!

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.884
Hey, hey, look who showed up.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.930
Flippy-boy. Yeah, you want to
flip your way out of this?

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.725
Too slow, old man.

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.131
Where you work out, Cinnabon?

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.566
Look who's back up, baby.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.688
I didn't know we were kicking.
Give me a second to stretch.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.046
All right.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.565
We're gonna throw some legs, huh?

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.324
You want to throw some legs, huh?

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.163
Boom!

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.969
That just happened.

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.127
What, were you raised by ninjas?

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.284
Congratulations.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.361
You won the fight.

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:09.441
Here's your prize.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:14.408
Thanks, little girl. It
looks just like you.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.690
It's a monkey!

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:20.321
Look at me!

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:23.370
I'm a stupid little monkey.

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.841
Good night.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.682
Come on, guys! We got to get out!

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.125
Let's go!

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.924
Lenny! Baby.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.241
- Baby, are you all right?
- I'm coming for you, Leonard!

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:46.284
I'm here for you, Leonard.
I'm here for you.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.328
Who... Who are you?

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.890
It's your pretty, shiny Penny.

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:54.491
Oops, sorry, I kicked your barrette.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:00.442
Sorry, honey!

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.563
You guys were Fuji and Tanaka out there.

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.051
This is just like high school.

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:11.011
Get drunk, get in a fight,
wind up back at Lamonsoff's, eating eggs.

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:13.082
Except for the drunk part, Mommy.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:19.041
All you guys together brings back
so many memories.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:22.251
- Dickie, is this you and Lenny?
- Let's see.

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.562
Yeah, me and Hollywood were
best friends in kindergarten.

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:25.926
- Yep.
- What happened?

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.560
What do you mean, "What happened?"
We were in different classes.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:29.886
We kind of drifted apart, right?

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:32.122
Yeah. He was in those smart classes.

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.690
I was in the other classes.

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.651
Hey, who's this guy?

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.683
- Anybody remember him?
- Who is that?

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.841
Wow, what happened to that kid?

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.206
He's still here.

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.927
Why do I know my new kid's
gonna end up looking like that?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.321
- You're having a baby, Lenny?
- Yeah.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:51.930
Yeah, so I'm told, Mrs. Lamonsoff.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.770
A surprise, huh?

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.171
Yes.

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:58.887
People today try to plan
things out so much.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:02.169
But don't think an unexpected
child is loved any less

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.481
than one you planned for.

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:08.567
Someday, Lenny, you won't even remember what
life was like with just three children.

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:11.883
You think we wanted Eric?

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:13.450
- He was an accident.
- Mama.

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:16.649
His father and I were in the
men's room at a Patriots game...

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.888
You know what, I think I'm
just gonna turn the page here.

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:21.042
I'm turning the page.

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.565
Finish the story!

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.203
Officer Dante's passed out on our lawn.

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:39.802
I know. I saw him trying
to arrest an anthill.

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.962
Want to talk about
the whole pregnancy thing?

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.049
It's okay. We'll talk tomorrow.

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:51.360
Okay.

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:54.762
Okay, you go to sleep.
I'll make this between me and the baby.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.208
Hello in there.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.244
This is your daddy speaking.

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:11.368
I just want to tell you
welcome to the family,

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:14.882
and I love you very, very, very much.

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:19.046
I really don't care if
you're a boy or girl.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.970
I just need you to promise me one thing.

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:27.200
When you're in elementary
school, study ballet,

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.011
so I can see that teacher
as much as possible.

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:31.327
Hey-

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.323
I knew that was coming.

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:38.801
To be honest,
I don't need no stinking ballet teacher.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.884
I'm married to the most
beautiful woman in the world,

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.200
your mommy.

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:47.362
Are you saying sweet things to me
because you want to fool around?

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:50.445
That would be a nice way
to kick off the summer.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.689
Okay, Mr. Romantic.

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:55.804
But let's do this quick,

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.723
we have a big day tomorrow, okay?

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.006
Absolutely.

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:00.844
Watch your head in there.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.321
Hang on. Hang on. I'm sorry, honey.

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:12.563
Don't move. Don't move.
Oh, my God, I'm going to!

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:19.768
I did it! I burpsnarted! Yes!

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.484
Lenny, grow up!

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.927
I did it for the baby!
