10:13.614 --> 10:16.548
Apart from detective hank dunn's
interest in you?

10:16.550 --> 10:19.718
Dunn? Are you kidding?
It'd be like dating my brother.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.153
Well, he ran his fingers
through his hair twice

10:22.155 --> 10:23.755
When he first saw you --
preening.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.523
Touched your arm
when he left.

10:25.525 --> 10:28.693
Are we here to talk about boys,
or do you see anything useful?

10:30.197 --> 10:32.197
So...

10:32.199 --> 10:33.498
He started here.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.899
We got it all
on the security tape,

10:34.901 --> 10:36.434
If you just want
to watch that.

10:36.436 --> 10:39.938
I see it better
doing it<i> this</i> way.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.473
He has a process.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.909
He went to work<i> here --</i>
gloves, hammer.

10:44.911 --> 10:48.246
Aaron brown is left-handed,
so...

10:48.248 --> 10:51.082
Smash, grab.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.817
Smash, grab.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.988
Yes, left that one --
just turquoise costume stuff.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.289
How does he get all this?

10:58.291 --> 11:00.392
I have no idea.
But it's kind of fun.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.060
Arriving here.

11:02.062 --> 11:06.131
Smash, remove panel,
take out the lockbox.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.532
Smash the lockbox.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.601
$3.4 million
in loose diamonds.

11:09.603 --> 11:12.671
Which he takes
before making his escape,

11:12.673 --> 11:17.308
Stopping first to smash down
the security camera.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.810
Basically correct?

11:18.812 --> 11:21.379
Yeah, i mean, it took him
a few whacks to break the glass,

11:21.381 --> 11:22.947
But otherwise, yeah.

11:22.949 --> 11:25.050
Aaron brown
didn't rob this store.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.519
Is this part of the fun?

11:27.521 --> 11:28.687
No, let me explain.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.522
Aaron brown is left-handed.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.091
Yeah, and if you'll check
the video, doc, you'll see

11:33.093 --> 11:35.694
That he used his left hand
to smash the cases.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.696
Yes, but not very deftly,

11:37.698 --> 11:39.898
Not as if
it was his dominant arm.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.199
You said yourself

11:41.201 --> 11:43.668
That it took him several tries
to break the glass.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.371
Perhaps the thief was<i> pretending</i>
to be left-handed.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.872
Additionally, aaron brown

11:47.874 --> 11:50.575
Had a complete tear
of his right anterior deltoid

11:50.577 --> 11:52.844
From when the cops
threw him to the ground

11:52.846 --> 11:54.646
With his arms
behind his back.

11:54.648 --> 11:58.416
His condition would have made
this gesture impossible.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.851
There's no way

11:59.853 --> 12:01.519
He could have knocked down
the security camera.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.322
I'm cheating, of course.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.857
It's right there
on the videotape.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.094
Our victim
cannot be your thief.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.296
I know i'm just homicide,
but isn't it a bit odd

12:11.298 --> 12:14.999
For the criminal to smash down
the camera<i> after</i> the crime?

12:15.001 --> 12:18.536
That's because
he<i> wanted</i> us to see it.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.138
Thank you, detective.

12:22.309 --> 12:26.277
Did the guy who does your
autopsies just blow up my case?

12:26.279 --> 12:27.412
Mm. I think so.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.180
He does that a lot.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.786
Lucas: So, the csi guys
found this mask

12:34.788 --> 12:36.588
In a garbage can a few blocks
away from the jewelry store.

12:36.590 --> 12:37.822
Can you imagine
that job,

12:37.824 --> 12:39.758
Just sifting through trash
all day?

12:39.760 --> 12:43.628
Lucas, you deposit
internal organs in formaldehyde.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.030
Yeah, but i'm used to death,
you know?

12:46.032 --> 12:49.300
It's the unknown stenches
of<i> life</i> that freak me out,

12:49.302 --> 12:52.837
[ sniffing ]
like -- ugh -- like old diapers
or leftover indian food.

12:52.839 --> 12:53.972
Bleccch!

12:53.974 --> 12:55.140
Lucas, smell this.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.609
[ sniffs ]

12:59.112 --> 13:00.378
Oh.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.913
That's actually nice.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.315
What is that --
pancakes?

13:04.317 --> 13:05.350
Yes!

13:05.352 --> 13:07.652
Lucas, we've got it.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.554
Which -- uh, you got it.
Yeah.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.256
What -- what do we got?

13:11.258 --> 13:13.191
[ thud ]

13:13.193 --> 13:14.192
Thank you.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.493
What do you got there?

13:15.495 --> 13:17.195
[ sighs ]
everything the d.A.'s office had

13:17.197 --> 13:19.798
On the heist aaron brown
went down for three years ago --

13:19.800 --> 13:21.332
Files, interviews,
the works.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.567
You thinking
if he was framed,

13:22.569 --> 13:24.269
It was an accomplice
on a previous job?

13:24.271 --> 13:25.570
Well, it could be.

13:25.572 --> 13:26.805
We find out
who robbed the jewelry store,

13:26.807 --> 13:28.273
Maybe we find out
who killed him.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.541
I'll take a crack
at these.

13:29.543 --> 13:30.875
Uh, wait.
What are you doing?

13:30.877 --> 13:32.043
I'm just helping out, jo.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.745
With paperwork?
Since when?

13:33.747 --> 13:36.447
Jo...
These are sean's files --

13:36.449 --> 13:38.883
Maybe depositions,
who knows what else.

13:38.885 --> 13:42.854
I'm not a wounded puppy, mike.
I can handle this.

13:47.227 --> 13:52.063
Sean:<i> People vs. Aaron brown,</i>
<i>deposition, december 3, 2010.</i>

13:52.065 --> 13:54.098
<i>This is prosecuting attorney</i>
<i>sean moore.</i>

13:54.100 --> 13:57.268
<i>Let's start with, how much</i>
<i>did you get for the diamonds?</i>

13:57.270 --> 13:58.469
<i>That i saw?</i>

14:01.308 --> 14:02.340
<i>No.</i>

14:02.342 --> 14:03.808
<i>My girl's having our baby,</i>

14:03.810 --> 14:06.110
<i>So, you know,</i>
<i>there's been expenses --</i>

14:06.112 --> 14:09.314
<i>Crib, new clothes.</i>

14:09.316 --> 14:10.315
<i>You a married man?</i>

14:10.317 --> 14:11.883
<i>I am.</i>

14:11.885 --> 14:13.651
<i>Family men shouldn't be</i>
<i>robbing jewelry stores, aaron.</i>

14:13.653 --> 14:15.420
[<i> chuckles</i> ]

14:15.422 --> 14:17.522
<i>Yeah, well, maybe my son will</i>
<i>learn from my mistakes, huh?</i>

14:17.524 --> 14:20.592
<i>Will i be able to see</i>
<i>my girl again before the trial?</i>

14:20.594 --> 14:23.194
<i>I'll see what i can do.</i>

<i>no. Only good things.</i>

14:39.846 --> 14:43.114
Henry:
Jo, detective hanson.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.793
Is that --
yep.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.600
[ whirring ]

15:02.602 --> 15:04.035
[ whirring stops ]

15:06.640 --> 15:08.940
[ exhales sharply ]

15:14.481 --> 15:16.047
We can put robots on mars,

15:16.049 --> 15:20.418
But i can't keep the gum from
getting stuck on that thing.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.820
Must be hard.

15:22.822 --> 15:25.123
I mean, not the gum.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.792
Seeing him.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.827
Feels like it's real
for a moment,

15:29.829 --> 15:32.230
Like you can talk
to him.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.834
No, i just...

15:36.836 --> 15:38.269
[ breathing shakily ]

15:38.271 --> 15:42.640
I just got caught off guard
for a second.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.275
That's understandable.

15:46.079 --> 15:49.814
As it is that you want
to keep it buried...

15:49.816 --> 15:52.216
And that you would like me
to mind my own business.

15:52.218 --> 15:55.954
You have excellent powers
of deduction, henry.

15:57.824 --> 16:00.091
What is it
you came up here for?

16:00.093 --> 16:04.395
I was wondering if you could
smell some perspiration for me.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.964
[ chuckles ]

16:05.966 --> 16:08.933
Henry, you always know
just what to say.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.501
So, explain this to me.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.638
That [sniffs] maple-syrupy/
pancake smell on a mask is --

16:13.640 --> 16:15.373
Was excreted
by whoever wore it.

16:15.375 --> 16:19.510
You see, that's the symptom
of untreated diabetes.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.579
Now, if we can find
an associate of aaron's --

16:21.581 --> 16:24.916
With diabetes, maybe he was
the one who robbed the store?

16:24.918 --> 16:28.419
So we got to get medical records
on every known associate.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.723
Ah.
That won't be necessary.

16:31.725 --> 16:34.726
This gentleman will suffice.

16:34.728 --> 16:37.128
Look at the darkness
around his skin folds --

16:37.130 --> 16:40.732
Acanthosis nigricans,
a symptom of diabetes.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.467
Name's diego rodriguez.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.135
But sorry, doc --
can't be him.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.337
Rap sheet says
he was aaron brown's accomplice

16:46.339 --> 16:47.638
Three years ago.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.774
But he went away for that, jo --
15 years.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.210
Got to be at least a dime
left on that.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.911
I'll check into it.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.749
Diego rodriguez was paroled
last month -- good behavior.

16:57.751 --> 16:58.950
Nice job, detectives.

16:58.952 --> 17:00.351
How'd you finger rodriguez
for this?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.620
[ clears throat ]
the doc smelled his sweat.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.088
Interesting police work.

17:04.090 --> 17:06.557
Well, i trust henry's nose
over evidence any day.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.359
Fair enough.
Let's go grab him.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.029
His parole officer gave us
his last known address.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.097
It's a warehouse
in queens.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.233
Guns and badges only,
doc.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.267
Yes, of course.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.602

17:17.604 --> 17:19.704
Look after her,
will you?

Hank: Diego rodriguez,
you're under arrest!

18:24.170 --> 18:26.838
Yeah. Looks like
it went through and through.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.440
[ whimpers ]
hurts like a bitch.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.708
You better call your m.E.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.710
Why?
Suspect is down.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.011
He's dead.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.515
[ groans ]

18:41.421 --> 18:42.854
Cause of death?
Rather straightforward.

18:42.856 --> 18:45.123
Diego rodriguez
died almost instantly

18:45.125 --> 18:48.292
When detective dunn's bullet
obliterated his heart.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.027
Any word from jo
on hanson?

18:50.029 --> 18:51.462
Yeah,
he's out of surgery.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.764
He's gonna be fine.
It's a flesh wound.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.199
[ sighs ]

18:55.201 --> 18:57.135
That's a terribly vague
description -- "flesh wound."

18:57.137 --> 18:58.870
I mean,
<i>every</i> wound's a flesh wound.

18:58.872 --> 19:02.006
[ chuckling ] well,
it's just a saying, doc. It's --

19:03.476 --> 19:05.810
Is that a diamond?

19:10.884 --> 19:12.817
[ exhales sharply ]

19:12.819 --> 19:14.752
Diamonds.

19:14.754 --> 19:15.853
Whoa.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.188
It appears

19:17.190 --> 19:21.025
Mr. Rodriguez swallowed
a condom full of stones.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.361
It must have burst when
the second bullet struck him.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.663
They must be
from the robbery.

19:25.665 --> 19:29.200
Well, only an expert in gemology
could say that.

19:29.202 --> 19:32.236
And the one that consults
for the nypd only works 9 to 5.

19:32.238 --> 19:35.106
Luckily, for us,
we have the next-best thing.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.745
I got one word
to describe these stones --

19:40.747 --> 19:41.913
"meh."

19:41.915 --> 19:43.080
"meh"?

19:43.082 --> 19:44.382
But the police were told

19:44.384 --> 19:46.651
That these diamonds
were top-of-the-line.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.952
Well, in jersey, sure,

19:47.954 --> 19:50.021
But with that clarity
and that color,

19:50.023 --> 19:51.322
They're an s-12 at best.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.157
This case
doesn't make sense.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.860
Why would diego plan
such an elaborate robbery

19:55.862 --> 19:57.862
Only to steal
worthless diamonds?

19:57.864 --> 19:59.263
I'm missing something.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.032
Look, before you pace yourself
right out of here,

20:01.034 --> 20:02.366
I need you
to turn your attention

20:02.368 --> 20:03.901
To a more pressing
police matter.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.136
Excuse me?

20:05.138 --> 20:07.471
The tang dynasty horse.
Who stole it?

20:07.473 --> 20:10.007
A customer?
I don't think so.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.610
A delivery person? Maybe,
but i usually chat them up.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.613
Then i remembered --
there was this asian kid,

20:15.615 --> 20:18.649
All tatted up,
with a low hat and a backpack.

20:18.651 --> 20:19.817
Came in here twice.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.385
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.088
You're profiling this young man,
abraham. You realize that?

20:24.090 --> 20:26.290
Yeah, well, why would he be
wearing a backpack?

20:26.292 --> 20:29.227
To carry books, his lunch --
anything.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.829

it was a bit chilly out.

You're making assumptions,

for the robbery,

Then ran him down?

20:56.789 --> 20:59.690
He shoots me, dunn kills him --
that's two cases closed.

That's it.

Okay.

No.
That's not it.

They were of low clarity,

Why would diego plan all this
to steal worthless diamonds?

And he drove a red car.

Wasn't from the car,

And yet,
based on the clotting,

When aaron was arrested,
he was looking at 20 years.

with the probation board.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.222
And he helped aaron
get his sentence reduced.

see his baby grow up.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.536
And he went off to bed,

41:13.538 --> 41:18.475
And i went for a walk
around the block.

41:18.477 --> 41:22.178
Next morning,
i left early for work.

41:22.180 --> 41:27.617
There was no way
i was gonna apologize first.

41:27.619 --> 41:31.654
I don't even remember
what the fight was about.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.624
But...

41:34.626 --> 41:40.463
The last thing
i said to my husband...

41:40.465 --> 41:43.299
[ voice breaking ]
it was in anger.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.235
[ sighs ]

41:45.237 --> 41:47.270
And i never...

41:47.272 --> 41:51.841
I never got the chance
to just tell him i was sorry.

41:56.515 --> 41:57.480
[ sniffles ]

41:57.482 --> 41:59.516
You were in love, jo.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.753
He knew.

42:03.755 --> 42:06.656
Trust me -- he knew.
