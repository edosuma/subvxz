00:58.440 --> 00:59.950
He's a magician.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.070
No, he smells too nice.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.400
Morning.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.230
Your book, sir.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.150
I'm obliged to you.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.790
'Some years ago, there
was, in the city of York,

02:13.840 --> 02:16.230
'a society of magicians.

02:16.280 --> 02:19.030
'They met up on the third Wednesday
of every month and read

02:19.080 --> 02:21.430
'each other long, dull papers upon

02:21.480 --> 02:23.870
'the history of English magic.

02:23.920 --> 02:26.230
'They were gentlemen
magicians, which is

02:26.280 --> 02:29.350
'to say they had never
harmed anyone by magic.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.910
'Nor ever done anyone
the slightest good.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.310
'In fact, to own the truth,

02:33.360 --> 02:37.030
'not one of these magicians had
ever cast the smallest spell.

02:37.080 --> 02:41.550
'Nor, by magic, caused one leaf to
tremble upon a tree, made one mote

02:41.600 --> 02:44.510
'of dust alter its course
or changed a single

02:44.560 --> 02:46.470
'hair upon anyone's head.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.750
'With this one minor reservation,

02:48.800 --> 02:51.230
'they enjoyed a reputation as some

02:51.280 --> 02:54.310
'of the wisest and
most magical gentlemen

02:54.360 --> 02:56.070
'in Yorkshire.'

02:56.120 --> 02:57.390
Mr...

02:59.360 --> 03:00.550
Mr Segundus!

03:00.600 --> 03:02.230
Yes.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.550
Excuse me. Er...

03:04.600 --> 03:06.430
ha...

03:06.480 --> 03:09.550
It has been no small inducement,

03:09.600 --> 03:11.630
in my coming to York,

03:11.680 --> 03:16.110
that your excellent and, er,
distinguished society exists here.

03:16.160 --> 03:19.470
~ Er, not to mention your extensive
library of magical books.
~ That's right.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.510
Er, I have studied magic,
gentlemen, for many years.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.430
The histories of the Raven King,

03:25.480 --> 03:28.190
the great magicians of long ago.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.950
I've read the new publications

03:30.000 --> 03:31.950
and even made my small

03:32.000 --> 03:34.150
contribution to their number.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.480
Excuse me.

03:37.760 --> 03:41.230
But I... but I have recently
begun to wonder why the great

03:41.280 --> 03:43.590
feats of magic that I read about

03:43.640 --> 03:46.470
remain in the pages of my books...

03:46.520 --> 03:49.150
and are not seen on the street or...

03:49.200 --> 03:51.070
on the battlefield.

03:51.120 --> 03:54.750
I have begun to wonder why modern
magicians are unable to work

03:54.800 --> 03:57.070
the magic that they write about.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.920
In short, gentlemen,
I wish to know...

04:01.280 --> 04:04.590
.. why is magic no longer
done in England.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.030
It is a long question, Mr...

04:10.080 --> 04:11.480
Segundus.

04:12.440 --> 04:15.110
Magicians study magic,

04:15.160 --> 04:18.750
the history of magic.
We do not perform it.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.470
You don't expect an astronomer
to create stars, eh?

04:23.640 --> 04:25.870
Or a botanist to invent
new flowers, eh?

04:25.920 --> 04:29.310
It is a child's question, I
appreciate, but no-one else...

04:29.360 --> 04:34.590
Classical magic, sir, is not a thing
for the gentlemen of this society.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.230
Nor any...

04:37.280 --> 04:38.430
gentleman.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.990
I do hope that you have not been

04:41.040 --> 04:43.830
trying to cast spells, sir.

04:52.280 --> 04:55.470
You told me certainly that there
would be books coming in.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.720
You took a guinea from me.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.720
Good day to you, sir.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.230
Mr Segundus, I say.

05:04.280 --> 05:08.190
Honeyfoot. I was there at the
society last night. May I?

05:08.240 --> 05:10.270
I have made myself disagreeable.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.070
No, sir. I think you hit
upon it quite correct.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.190
Why is magic no longer done?

05:15.240 --> 05:17.030
I cannot find it answered anywhere.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.910
Can you believe there are
no books of magic to be had?

05:19.960 --> 05:21.670
In York!

05:21.720 --> 05:24.750
~ Books about magic are rare enough.
~ Books of magic.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.990
Oh, my dear fellow, they're
more precious than rubies.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.230
Even the society only
has a few pages.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.870
I have tried everywhere else.

05:31.920 --> 05:35.630
The society is my last
throw of the dice. Sir!

05:35.680 --> 05:38.590
We're growing stale,
we need fresh opinions.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.230
Oh, I'm... I'm afraid that those
books have been sold, sir.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.310
I reserved them!

05:43.360 --> 05:45.110
Yes, I am sorry for it, sir.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.230
Oh, it is no matter.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.950
Do you have anything upon the nature
of clouds, rain, atmospheres?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.550
Yes, sir. Yes, I do,
as a matter of fact.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.110
Oh, that's interesting. I'm most
fascinated by clouds myself.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.630
Keep an eye open.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.220
Mr Segundus.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.660
At least I can find the devil
who keeps swiping my books.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.470
Ah.

06:08.520 --> 06:09.950
There.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.400
Norrell.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.110
Hurtfew Abbey.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.550
It is not an age for magic.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.940
Why then do you persist, sir?

06:25.360 --> 06:27.350
What is it?

06:27.400 --> 06:29.270
Tremendously dirty.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.870
From a street magician in London.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.470
"A spell to join together articles

06:34.520 --> 06:36.630
"which have been parted."

06:36.680 --> 06:39.470
~ Does it work?
~ No.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.710
He was a vagabond, you see.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.870
Yellow curtain sort of fellow.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.000
Persuaded me to part with a rather
large sum of money for that.

06:48.280 --> 06:52.190
And then he called me back, said
he'd tell me a secret for nothing.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.430
Told me that one day magic would
be restored to England by

06:55.480 --> 06:57.190
two magicians.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.310
Old prophecies are nonsense.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.910
I know.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.430
But it set me upon my present path.

07:03.480 --> 07:07.870
We are two magicians. John
Segundus and Mr Honeyfoot.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.990
Sounds well.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.990
One would expect him to pretend
that I was one of the two,

07:12.040 --> 07:15.200
but in the end he told me, rather
plainly, that I was not.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.300
Mr Norrell?

07:41.760 --> 07:43.160
Come in.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.910
Watch your step,
gentlemen. The way is...

07:51.960 --> 07:53.640
convoluted.

08:24.800 --> 08:29.470
It's Mr Honeyfoot and Mr Segundus
of the York Society of Magicians.

08:29.520 --> 08:33.919
I read your account of the careers
of Martin Pale's fairy servants, sir.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.230
It's a creditable piece of work.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.710
Well...

08:39.760 --> 08:42.590
there was Master
Fallowthought, was there not?

08:42.640 --> 08:44.440
You left him out.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.030
A minor spirit, but nevertheless...

08:47.080 --> 08:49.150
Fallowthought?

08:49.200 --> 08:51.670
I have never even heard of him.

08:52.680 --> 08:56.270
Forgive me, sir, but what a library!

08:56.320 --> 08:58.830
Yes, I forget. Of course,
he is described in

08:58.880 --> 09:02.510
Holgarth and Pickles' history of their
own dealings with Master Fallowthought,

09:02.560 --> 09:04.190
which you can scarcely have read.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.950
You have that book?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.800
May we, may we be permitted to...

09:12.200 --> 09:15.000
Nothing would be more
agreeable to me.

09:20.040 --> 09:23.710
How To Putte Questions To The
Dark And Understand Its Answers.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.110
It's a foolish work.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.630
This is Belasis's instructions.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.150
Every copy of this was
destroyed centuries ago.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.390
I did devote a great deal of time to
Belasis in my youth, but no longer.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.590
He is mystical when he
should be clear and clear

09:38.640 --> 09:39.910
when he should be mystical.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.550
These are all... books of magic.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.470
Mr Norrell, such...

09:45.520 --> 09:47.790
~ Surely you will find your answer here.
~ Answer?

09:47.840 --> 09:49.230
To a simple question, sir.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.870
In the past, magic was done
as a matter of course.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.510
It... it was as much a part
of this country as the rain.

09:54.560 --> 09:58.150
Then 300 years ago it died,
seemingly overnight.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.470
We wish to know...

10:00.520 --> 10:03.680
why magic has fallen from
its once great state.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.360
We wish to know why is there
no more magic done in England?

10:14.040 --> 10:16.380
It is a wrong question, sir.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.680
Magic is not ended in England.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.710
I myself am quite a tolerable,

10:23.760 --> 10:25.510
practical...

10:25.560 --> 10:26.960
magician.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.270
Well done.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.350
Well... it is done.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.200
Show these gentlemen
out, Childermass.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.150
Absolute tripe!

10:39.200 --> 10:41.870
Oh, I'm so sorry, sirs,

10:41.920 --> 10:44.270
to see you bringing magic

10:44.320 --> 10:46.830
into such disrepute.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.470
This Norrell is lying.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.550
I disa... I disagree,
I believe Mr Norrell.

10:51.600 --> 10:55.510
Did you see magic
done or did you not?

10:57.480 --> 11:00.510
Gentlemen, the answer
is a simple one, eh?

11:00.560 --> 11:05.150
We shall invite Mr Norrell to
prove his ridiculous assertion.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.590
To do magic for us.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.270
And if he cannot, or will not,

11:10.320 --> 11:13.270
to lay off disturbing
our peace of mind!

11:32.880 --> 11:35.870
This is the hour and place he
appointed, and he doesn't come.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.950
Mr Norrell concedes defeat.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.720
Not at all.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.600
Who are you, sir?

11:47.200 --> 11:49.510
A word or two before you go in.

11:49.560 --> 11:53.110
If Mr Norrell fails to do
the magic he has promised,

11:53.160 --> 11:56.350
he will publicly withdraw his claim
to be a practical magician,

11:56.400 --> 11:58.910
~ indeed a magician of any sort.
~ That's quite right.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.160
And swears never to make
any such claim again.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.950
~ Here's his hand on it.
~ I'm sure he needn't go so far.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.470
We have no desire to punish him.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.630
However, my master only thinks
it's fair to extract the same

12:10.680 --> 12:12.950
promise from each of you...

12:15.280 --> 12:17.280
.. should he succeed.

12:17.960 --> 12:20.350
Here's the paper and there's
the stuff to sign your name.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.550
Well, I do not believe
he can do magic,

12:23.600 --> 12:25.040
and so...

12:27.280 --> 12:30.030
I will sign because I believe he can.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.110
And I hope he achieves recognition

12:32.160 --> 12:36.240
and will use his powers for the good
of the nation in this time of war.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.280
Sir.

12:57.160 --> 13:00.950
I will not sign. Magic
is my life, sir.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.940
What shall I do when
it is taken from me?

13:10.680 --> 13:12.830
We shall say Mr Norrell's
contract is with all

13:12.880 --> 13:15.080
members of the society...

13:16.240 --> 13:18.240
.. except Mr Segundus.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.470
('Come here. Come here.)

14:45.520 --> 14:47.190
('Come here.')

14:48.840 --> 14:51.310
~ ('We saw him.)
~ (Tyranny. Tyranny.)

14:51.360 --> 14:53.190
~ ('He murdered her.)
~ (He murdered her.)

14:53.240 --> 14:55.470
~ ('We know. We know. We saw him.)
~ (We saw it.)

14:55.520 --> 14:57.430
('There was no-one to
see but the stones.)

14:57.480 --> 15:00.830
~ ('No-one saw but the stones.)
~ (The stones, the stones.)

15:00.880 --> 15:03.070
('He murdered her! And no-one saw!')

15:03.120 --> 15:04.230
(The statues.)

15:04.280 --> 15:05.710
('The stones. Dig up his bones!)

15:05.760 --> 15:07.910
('Let him be punished
for his wickedness!')

15:07.960 --> 15:10.160
He has brought them alive.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.790
Ooh!

15:20.840 --> 15:22.080
Oh!

15:32.120 --> 15:34.660
~ Usurper.
~ Usurper? How dare you?!

15:35.720 --> 15:38.910
~ Lady Catherine. Catherine of Winchester.
~ You killed my horse, sir!

15:38.960 --> 15:41.910
Oh, forever upon that damned horse!

15:41.960 --> 15:43.960
Get you gone, father.

15:44.920 --> 15:48.840
My boot is on the wrong foot
and it is paining my bunion.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.230
I don't know what you're
talking about.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.080
I don't know!

16:30.600 --> 16:34.400
We have not seen the likes
of that for three centuries!

16:57.560 --> 16:59.590
I am sorry for it, sirs.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.510
Do not be.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.710
Magic is restored to England.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.390
I hope it can do some good.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.790
Do you think Mr Norrell
would be offended

17:07.839 --> 17:09.790
if I wrote to the London
newspapers of this?

17:09.839 --> 17:12.240
I very much think he would be.

17:13.480 --> 17:17.550
But I rather think my master has
hidden his talent long enough.

17:17.599 --> 17:19.990
It is time for him to take his place.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.470
And London is where I shall take him.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.710
Well, if that is how the
first magician behaves,

17:25.760 --> 17:28.960
I dare not think what
the second will be like.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.230
'The Lord be with you.'

17:34.280 --> 17:35.820
Let us pray.

17:39.160 --> 17:42.660
In the desolate plateau of
the Iberian peninsula...

17:48.120 --> 17:51.630
.. and on the battlefields of
France and the low countries.

17:51.680 --> 17:55.990
Lord, we beseech your help in
these times for our country.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.240
Fighting a Godless enemy.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.120
Lord, we ask for courage, wisdom.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.870
For the support of your
grace and the endurance

18:09.920 --> 18:11.790
of your providence.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.990
Which daily strengthens us. Amen.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.630
Amen.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.070
'Well done, Henry.'

18:18.120 --> 18:21.350
You're using your voice much
better, more authority.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.070
Yes, I... I think you have
definitely improved.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.030
Especially the, er, the voice.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.870
Thank you, Jonathan.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.030
We'd saved a place for you.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.990
Oh, I did not see.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.950
I was at the back.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.830
Yes. Right at the back.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.870
Enjoying your Sunday, Mr Atkinson?

18:38.920 --> 18:41.310
I... I've done everything
you want in the way of...

18:41.360 --> 18:42.950
I hardly play cards.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.550
I drink very, very little, scarcely
more than a bottle a day.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.590
And, well...

18:48.640 --> 18:50.790
I've no objection to going
to church more often.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.470
Twice a week if you'd like it better.

18:52.520 --> 18:55.520
I leave such matters
to your own conscience.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.830
I do not know, perhaps you don't
like my going to Bath or Brighton

18:58.880 --> 18:59.910
or...

18:59.960 --> 19:03.910
But really, the ladies there, you
have nothing to fear from them.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.070
They are without doubt
very charming, but...

19:07.120 --> 19:09.350
That hadn't even occurred to me.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.540
Oh.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.590
~ Arabella.
~ Jonathan.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.270
I only wish that you would...

19:16.320 --> 19:18.920
find a way to occupy your time.

19:19.920 --> 19:23.040
No-one loves a holiday better than
I, but perpetual holidays...

19:24.520 --> 19:27.070
~ Does it make you happy?
~ You make me happy.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.870
~ A man needs an occupation, Jonathan.
~ Arabella, you know perfectly
well that my father...

19:30.920 --> 19:32.830
~ I'm going away.
~ What?

19:32.880 --> 19:35.870
With Henry, to his new
parish. Help him settle.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.060
Oh.

19:38.240 --> 19:41.310
I'd not thought to do this
now, but I see I must act.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.150
Jonathan?

19:43.200 --> 19:44.870
Do not act.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.190
Think.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.800
I'll not be gone forever.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.470
'It is cruel, sir,'

20:00.520 --> 20:03.390
for a fellow of my age to be
kept from taking up any useful

20:03.440 --> 20:04.630
position in the world.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.030
It is no wonder that I go to
seed in this manner of which

20:07.080 --> 20:08.830
you so desperately disapprove.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.710
Which useful position
had you in mind?

20:11.760 --> 20:14.760
Any, sir. Give it to
me and I shall fill it.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.750
One more of those and you'll
lose YOUR position, sir.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.950
As for you, let me see, you have...

20:21.000 --> 20:22.550
Good God, man!

20:22.600 --> 20:23.950
For pity's sake, Father.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.110
Have him close the window,
the man is clearly ill.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.230
Open all the windows.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.280
I'm not blind, my son.

20:31.240 --> 20:35.590
This clergyman's girl wishes
you to be a man of destiny.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.750
She does not know that you,

20:37.800 --> 20:39.990
like your mother, are weak

20:40.040 --> 20:42.830
and skittish and doomed to fulfil no

20:42.880 --> 20:44.630
function more useful than

20:44.680 --> 20:46.870
that of a clothes horse.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.910
~ My dear fellow!
~ Leave him!

20:50.960 --> 20:52.510
On your feet, sir.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.700
Stand beside the window.

20:58.280 --> 21:02.990
And you, sir, you've proved yourself
a failure in everything you've done.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.910
And you shall have no assistance

21:05.960 --> 21:09.110
in finding any occupation whilst

21:09.160 --> 21:13.440
I am yet living and
master in this house.

21:20.160 --> 21:23.150
I had thought to ask your
permission to marry your sister.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.270
But I rather think it is her
permission I'd struggle to get.

21:26.320 --> 21:29.110
Have some brandy in that, Henry.
It makes it taste much better.

21:29.160 --> 21:32.660
It is Sunday, Jonathan. I
have a carriage to catch.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.510
Arabella loves you. She merely...

21:35.560 --> 21:38.150
~ I have tried.
~ She just wishes you to have purpose.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.990
I have tried to buy an ironworks,

21:41.040 --> 21:42.950
the smelting room gave me a headache.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.390
I have tried to establish a business
to collect fossils at Lyme Regis.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.350
~ Yes.
~ Much too rainy. Have you,
have you been to Lyme Regis?

21:49.400 --> 21:50.670
Cannot your father...

21:50.720 --> 21:54.480
My father delights in torturing
me, as he tortures his servants.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.590
As he tortured my mother.

21:58.640 --> 22:01.080
Jonathan, God will...

22:03.480 --> 22:06.230
A way will become clear
to you, Jonathan.

22:06.280 --> 22:09.280
All I've ever truly wished
for is your sister.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.980
It often happens in the
most unexpected of ways.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.830
Goodbye, Jonathan.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.640
Do not drown yourself.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.520
I will have one more.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.520
~ What?
~ I fear there's been a quarrel.
The door, it's quite jammed.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.510
Come on, together.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.470
The poor fellow is ill!

23:09.520 --> 23:12.620
This room is as cold
as a Scotsman's chimney!

23:13.560 --> 23:15.560
Father!

23:18.160 --> 23:19.800
Father?

23:55.920 --> 23:57.670
She regrets her absence
in Cumberland.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.670
She does not like to
think of me being alone

23:59.720 --> 24:02.150
and friendless at such a time.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.790
Well, I have an estate to run.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.780
I'm not to be without
an occupation now.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.310
~ What sort of an interval
do you think is appropriate?
~ Eh?

24:11.360 --> 24:13.670
For me to ride up there and
ask for her hand, Jeremy.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.430
To Cumberland!

24:15.480 --> 24:18.070
What sort of period of mourning
do you think is fit?

24:18.120 --> 24:19.870
A month? Two weeks?

24:19.920 --> 24:21.460
Three days?

24:29.160 --> 24:32.590
"And Mr Norrell, having taken a
London house for the season..."

24:32.640 --> 24:35.590
I have not taken it,
I have bought it.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.230
210 guineas.

24:38.280 --> 24:42.590
".. having taken a London house for
the season, leaves us hungry to see

24:42.640 --> 24:45.630
"which, if any, new wonders
he will perform

24:45.680 --> 24:48.020
"after the miracle of York."

24:49.240 --> 24:50.640
Miracle?

24:52.040 --> 24:53.510
"The miracle of York."

24:53.560 --> 24:57.030
"Are we to see the proof of
his genius with our own eyes?

24:57.080 --> 25:00.590
"Has magic truly returned,
or is Mr Norrell

25:00.640 --> 25:03.870
"simply a wealthier version
of the familiar conjuror

25:03.920 --> 25:07.120
~ "in his yellow-curtained tent?"
~ I have never...

25:07.840 --> 25:10.310
I have contended with
this for 40 years.

25:10.360 --> 25:11.990
Stiggers and disapproval.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.710
Well, this is why we have
come here, is it not?

25:14.760 --> 25:17.350
We have come to change that.

25:17.400 --> 25:20.270
The Star has reprinted
Mr Segundus's letter...

25:20.320 --> 25:22.190
with illustrations.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.390
Why is London so expensive?

25:25.440 --> 25:27.150
So noisy?

25:27.200 --> 25:28.960
And the smell.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.910
Is that supposed to be me?

25:34.960 --> 25:36.270
With a beard?

25:36.320 --> 25:38.030
And a pointy hat!

25:38.080 --> 25:39.790
They intend no disrespect, sir.

25:39.840 --> 25:42.920
That is what most folk believe
a magician to look like.

25:44.680 --> 25:46.270
The magic of the old country.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.030
The magic of the Raven King,

25:48.080 --> 25:49.950
300 years gone...

25:50.000 --> 25:52.070
and turned to feathers.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.900
The Raven King.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.550
These men give the practice of
magic such an appalling name.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.950
Well, if nothing else, sir,

26:11.000 --> 26:14.300
you should pull that picture
out of their heads.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.350
Whoa!

26:16.400 --> 26:18.110
Listen.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.270
This is what you have worked for.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.430
This is your great opportunity.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.390
If all goes as it should here,

26:24.440 --> 26:27.030
when folk think of a magician...

26:27.080 --> 26:29.430
They will think of myself.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.640
Courage, sir. Charm.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.470
He is the Secretary of State for War.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.030
Remember what a gift
it is that you offer,

26:38.080 --> 26:40.880
then I am sure he
will be your friend.

26:44.240 --> 26:47.550
'You, sir, are an
embarrassment to your party'

26:47.600 --> 26:49.740
and to this whole house.

26:52.120 --> 26:55.190
Our forces are hopelessly
outnumbered by the French.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.150
We stay in Salamanca and be
massacred, or lead our troops

26:58.200 --> 27:01.270
over the mountains and
leave them to the snow.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.030
This is a final disgrace.

27:04.080 --> 27:08.390
The final act of a criminally
incompetent government.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.750
Shame upon you. Shame!

27:15.120 --> 27:18.390
Order. Sir Walter Pole.

27:18.440 --> 27:21.430
The honourable gentleman is
well known for his excellent

27:21.480 --> 27:24.150
impromptu speeches, and it is
good to know that the time he

27:24.200 --> 27:26.230
spends preparing them is not wasted.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.550
I would have been happy
to hear a deal less of it.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.750
But as Napoleon himself has said,

27:30.800 --> 27:34.390
you should never interrupt your
enemy when he is making a mistake.

27:34.440 --> 27:37.510
'There will be no retreat
from Salamanca.

27:37.560 --> 27:41.310
But I am a man of my word and
a custodian of English blood.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.710
There will be no retreat!

27:47.480 --> 27:49.150
There will be a massacre.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.740
Well done, Sir Walter. Well done.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.680
Sir Walter!

27:54.840 --> 27:56.310
Sir Walter!

27:56.360 --> 27:57.900
Sir Walt...

28:03.920 --> 28:06.070
What assistance may I be to you, sir?

28:06.120 --> 28:09.820
I have an appointment with
Sir Walter to talk about...

28:10.040 --> 28:11.150
.. magic.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.960
Ah, you are the magician. Mr Norris?

28:15.040 --> 28:16.190
Norrell.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.830
Sir Walter begs humbly that he
may receive you at his private

28:18.880 --> 28:20.350
residence.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.670
Aha, I'm very glad to meet you, sir.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.990
It seems London talks of little else
but the extraordinary Mr Norrell.

28:36.040 --> 28:39.150
Please. Mr Norrell
is a magician, ma'am.

28:39.200 --> 28:43.550
A person of great reputation in
his native county of Yorkshire.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.790
And where are your
fairy servants, sir?

28:46.840 --> 28:49.910
Are they visible only to yourself
or may others see them?

28:49.960 --> 28:53.070
Oh, uh, fairies are
mythological creatures, madam.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.590
Mythological?

28:54.640 --> 28:56.230
I meant to say that they do no...

28:56.280 --> 28:59.150
They... they did not exist in
the way the stories have them.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.950
They're a poisonous race, their
help is always regretted, it is

29:02.000 --> 29:03.390
always a heavy price.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.230
You are not at all what
I expected, eh, Stephen?

29:06.280 --> 29:08.590
I had not formed a picture
of Mr Norrell, sir.

29:08.640 --> 29:11.750
I had heard you were
a practical magician.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.190
I hope you are not offended.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.670
It's a great relief to see that
you are nothing of the sort.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.720
You are a theoretical
magician, I imagine.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.840
They say you have
something to ask me?

29:24.120 --> 29:25.630
I...

29:25.680 --> 29:26.870
W... That is

29:26.920 --> 29:30.550
to say, I beg your pardon but
I am in fact a practical,

29:30.600 --> 29:32.710
erm, magician.

29:32.760 --> 29:35.390
But I very earnestly hope that
I will not by this admission

29:35.440 --> 29:37.190
lose your good opinion.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.790
No, by no means.

29:38.840 --> 29:41.630
The... the misapprehension
under which you labour...

29:41.680 --> 29:43.950
by which I mean of course the
belief that all practical

29:44.000 --> 29:46.990
magicians are charlatans,
arises from the appalling

29:47.040 --> 29:50.590
idleness of English magicians
in the last 300 years.

29:50.640 --> 29:54.750
I have performed one small
feat of modern magic, which

29:54.800 --> 29:58.190
the people of York were kind enough
to say that they found astounding.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.910
I am come, Sir Walter, to offer you

30:00.960 --> 30:03.630
my help in our present difficulties.

30:04.040 --> 30:06.630
~ You mean the war?
~ Yes.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.710
My dear sir, what has magic
to do with the war?

30:09.760 --> 30:11.990
I believe I have heard
what you did in York

30:12.040 --> 30:14.550
and I am sure the housewives
were very grateful.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.830
But I can scarcely see how such
magic may be applied to the war.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.150
True enough, soldiers get very dirty.

30:20.200 --> 30:24.270
Sir, I made half-a-hundred stone
figures talk in York Minster.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.390
It was nothing to do with housewives.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.310
My fiancee, Miss Wintertowne.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.430
Oh, er, enchante, miss.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.190
Very fond of magic myself.

30:38.240 --> 30:41.070
There's a wonderful street
magician - Vinculus.

30:41.120 --> 30:44.670
~ He's all lies and doom.
~ Oh, well, no, street magicians
are the very worst.

30:44.720 --> 30:47.060
All magicians are vagabonds.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.070
My dear Emma is to be
married to Sir Walter

30:51.120 --> 30:53.230
at St George's in ten days' time.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.480
M... many congratulations.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.590
I am often ill myself.

30:57.640 --> 31:01.150
I find some warm lemon and nutmeg...

31:02.680 --> 31:07.310
Mr Norrell, I'm not sure what
help you hope to offer us.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.900
I am sorry to say it will not do.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.910
Magic is not respectable, sir.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.070
The government cannot
meddle in such things.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.910
Frankly, had I better understood
what you were proposing to offer,

31:17.960 --> 31:20.630
I would not have agreed to meet you.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.600
~ How'd it go?
~ Very well.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.070
Tolerably well.

31:40.120 --> 31:43.960
As bad as that, eh? Did
you do any magic for him?

31:45.040 --> 31:48.270
This is not the way to the house.
Hanover Square is that way.

31:48.320 --> 31:52.030
We are going to Lady Godesdone's
house. It's a soiree.

31:52.080 --> 31:56.070
A party? I wish to go
home and read a book.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.470
Powerful gentlemen spend
more time at parties

31:58.520 --> 32:00.910
than they do in Parliament.

32:00.960 --> 32:04.630
You cannot do this from the comfort
of your own fireside, sir.

32:04.680 --> 32:07.150
We're not in Yorkshire any more.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.040
Pardon me. Excuse me.

32:19.960 --> 32:22.710
I heard all the ladies of Yorkshire
may put out their dirty linen

32:22.760 --> 32:25.470
in baskets at night, and in the
morning it is magically clean.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.270
He is as rich as a very Jew.

32:27.320 --> 32:32.390
A wealthy uncle died, leaving him
a large estate, Hurtfew Abbey.

32:32.440 --> 32:35.950
~ It's in Yorkshire.
~ Wealthy uncles are in
short supply these days.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.630
I was with him, only this morning, to hear
of the wonderful magic he's been doing.

32:40.680 --> 32:43.590
What kind of wonderful magic
are we talking about, exactly?

32:43.640 --> 32:46.640
The cleaning of laundry
is commonly known.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.070
Admit it, you don't know him.

33:24.120 --> 33:26.430
On the contrary, nobody in
London knows him better.

33:26.480 --> 33:29.790
We came here in the expectation of
seeing something very extraordinary,

33:29.840 --> 33:31.430
such as we have read in the Times,

33:31.480 --> 33:34.350
and instead we have been forced
to make our own entertainment.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.550
That gentleman is reading a book!

33:36.600 --> 33:37.990
I beg your pardon.

33:38.040 --> 33:41.030
No, no, you do not know him as I.

33:41.080 --> 33:44.830
Mr Norrell has a shrewd
notion of his own value.

33:44.880 --> 33:47.750
A gentleman who buys a
house in Hanover Square.

33:47.800 --> 33:50.790
~ I beg your pardon.
~ What!

33:50.840 --> 33:52.580
I am Mr Norrell.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.470
Oh!

33:57.520 --> 34:00.510
Mr Norrell!

34:00.560 --> 34:05.470
I can scarcely begin to express my
delight in making your acquaintance.

34:05.520 --> 34:09.230
I had mistook you, sir.

34:09.280 --> 34:14.469
But now that I behold you, I plainly
see you have the measured

34:14.520 --> 34:18.199
and dignified air of
a magical scholar.

34:19.440 --> 34:23.310
Lascelles, do you not think
Mr Norrell has the grave

34:23.360 --> 34:26.949
and sober bearing of a scholar?

34:27.000 --> 34:30.639
~ 'Spose so.
~ My name is Drawlight.

34:32.280 --> 34:39.630
I have been your John the Baptist,
sir, preparing the way for you.

34:39.679 --> 34:42.150
I knew we would be friends.

34:42.199 --> 34:49.830
Here we are, chatting so
comfortably to one another.

34:49.880 --> 34:54.230
This is all for you, sir.

34:54.280 --> 34:57.030
Yes, I am becoming aware of that.

34:57.080 --> 34:59.510
Let me announce you.

34:59.560 --> 35:03.190
And I pray, do not think it
would be considered an insult

35:03.240 --> 35:07.150
to the company if you were to
perform a trick or two of magic.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.320
No, no, no, no... I...

35:16.360 --> 35:18.750
My lords.

35:18.800 --> 35:22.550
My, my lords, ladies and gentlemen,

35:22.600 --> 35:26.430
may I introduce to
you my dear friend,

35:26.480 --> 35:28.230
the saviour of English magic,

35:28.280 --> 35:32.560
the magician of Hanover
Square, Mr Norrell.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.120
He has disappeared.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.960
Can I help you, sir?

35:46.240 --> 35:48.870
The rain shall make a door for me.

35:48.920 --> 35:52.390
And I shall walk through it.

35:52.440 --> 35:55.550
Oh, yes, you think yourself
a very fine fellow.

35:55.600 --> 35:58.540
Hoarding books like
a miser hoards gold.

35:59.560 --> 36:00.790
Open up!

36:00.840 --> 36:04.350
Well, I have a book, sir.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.830
A book you won't find in
your library, or any other.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.590
It's written by the Raven King,

36:11.640 --> 36:14.360
and it tells me all about you.

36:17.120 --> 36:20.680
Vinculus, magician of Threadneedle
Street, at your service.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.990
Well, know this, magician -

36:26.040 --> 36:28.640
your coming was foretold long ago.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.470
I've been expecting you
these past 20 years.

36:32.520 --> 36:35.150
Now I've come to explain
your destiny to you,

36:35.200 --> 36:37.430
as it is written in my book.

36:37.480 --> 36:39.470
Oh, prophecies, is it!

36:39.520 --> 36:41.630
Well, magic cannot
see into the future

36:41.680 --> 36:44.310
and rascals who claim
otherwise are liars.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.790
~ Childermass!
~ These are the words of the Raven King.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.430
He was a charlatan, sir. Childermass!

36:49.480 --> 36:51.550
~ Two magicians shall appear in England.
~ Two?

36:51.600 --> 36:53.750
The name of one shall be Fearfulness,

36:53.800 --> 36:56.270
the name of the other, Arrogance.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.630
~ Did you say two?
~ Ssh.

36:58.680 --> 37:02.790
The first shall fear me, the
second shall long to behold me.

37:02.840 --> 37:08.070
The first shall bury his heart
in the dark wood beneath the snow,

37:08.120 --> 37:10.630
yet still feel its ache.

37:10.680 --> 37:14.790
The second shall see his dearest
possession in his enemy's hand.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.580
Both will fail.

37:17.880 --> 37:21.040
The nameless slave shall
be a king in a strange land.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.590
I will return.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.840
His words, sir, not mine.

37:29.200 --> 37:32.840
I will return. There.

37:40.560 --> 37:41.960
Goodbye.

37:46.440 --> 37:49.040
Childermass!

37:51.120 --> 37:53.070
I want that man gone.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.590
I want him run out of London.
You shall have some spells.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.630
~ I don't need any spells. What did he want?
~ What?

37:58.680 --> 38:02.190
The man put himself to a great deal of trouble
and risked a hanging. What did he want?

38:02.240 --> 38:05.110
~ To give a prophecy from
the Raven King. Nonsense.
~ The Raven King?

38:05.160 --> 38:06.630
He said he had a book. Nonsense.

38:06.680 --> 38:10.590
But if he does have a book, I want it,
and then I want to go home to Yorkshire.

38:10.640 --> 38:13.030
To Yorkshire? We've
only just moved here.

38:13.080 --> 38:16.150
This house is not respectable
enough - such a tiny library.

38:16.200 --> 38:19.990
No, you're doing it wrong. You've got dozens
of invitations to fancy houses and you,

38:20.040 --> 38:23.150
you either turn them
down or you scarper.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.270
That's not how you get things done.

38:25.320 --> 38:28.870
Why do you not at least do some
magic here? Just show them.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.910
I'm not a performing monkey.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.150
Have Davy bring down
the packing boxes.

38:33.200 --> 38:36.190
Do you wish to make a success
of this? Or do you not?

38:36.240 --> 38:37.590
There.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.600
Take these spells.
Use them if you must.

38:45.840 --> 38:51.030
One-penny spells, two-penny spells.
I got a guinea spell for you, sir.

38:51.080 --> 38:55.990
Let me importune some fortune into
your sorry little life, sir.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.950
Pull out your purses and procure
some curses. All right, darling?

38:59.000 --> 39:03.270
For five shillings I'll confer
with the River Thames and find
that runaway husband of yours, eh?

39:03.320 --> 39:05.270
No? How much for your pies, mate?

39:05.320 --> 39:07.320
More than you've got.

39:12.680 --> 39:15.840
Ah! Mr Norrell, sir.

39:17.200 --> 39:21.990
Drawlight, hmm? Your
John the Baptist.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.310
A moment of your time, sir.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.510
Ah!

39:44.560 --> 39:47.270
Ah, a spell to make an
obstinate man leave London.

39:47.320 --> 39:52.190
One spell to discover what my
enemy is doing presently. Cheap.

39:52.240 --> 39:55.830
Well, you can tell the magician of Hanover
Square that his spells have no effect on me.

39:55.880 --> 39:59.350
That's because I haven't cast them yet.
There's a true magician in England now.

39:59.400 --> 40:02.110
I know magicians and I know
magic and I say this -

40:02.160 --> 40:06.000
all magicians lie, that one
more than most. Oh, yes.

40:07.520 --> 40:11.120
I think you and I had better
have a chat, don't you?

40:12.760 --> 40:13.960
Why?

40:16.920 --> 40:18.950
You left so suddenly last night, sir,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.390
and I had so much to say and I'm
sure we will be such friends.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.310
Davy, you should use
some calf-skin gloves.

40:24.360 --> 40:27.510
Do mind the spines,
Lucas, the spines.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.550
You are not leaving, sir?

40:29.600 --> 40:31.790
I came here to restore
magic to respectability

40:31.840 --> 40:33.110
and to do some good for the war.

40:33.160 --> 40:36.430
I am clearly bound to fail. These
men in government will not listen.

40:36.480 --> 40:40.950
Sir, if you will permit
me. I know these men.

40:41.000 --> 40:46.280
Just a spell or two would have
them embracing you like a brother.

40:48.160 --> 40:54.070
I only ask that I be the gentleman
to introduce you to society.

40:54.120 --> 40:57.390
Just one small piece of magic.

40:57.440 --> 40:59.390
Like you did for the
housewives in Yorkshire.

40:59.440 --> 41:03.030
I have never washed any linen in my
life, by magical means or otherwise.

41:03.080 --> 41:04.990
Who invented this nonsense?

41:05.040 --> 41:07.440
I suppose it is no matter who.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.150
So where's this book of yours?

41:10.200 --> 41:12.830
You'll never have my book.
You'll never even see it.

41:12.880 --> 41:16.550
~ It's my inheritance.
~ From who? The Raven King?

41:16.600 --> 41:19.470
Well, you can't hide
the truth from me.

41:21.280 --> 41:26.790
The cards of Marseilles.
Shall we see your fortune?

41:26.840 --> 41:30.240
Curses! Curses upon your neighbour!

41:33.240 --> 41:38.550
For the present, your actions are
governed by a hermit - Norrell.

41:38.600 --> 41:41.350
We knew that already.

41:41.400 --> 41:45.000
Ah, this one tells me you've weighed
your choices and made a decision.

41:46.080 --> 41:49.960
This one tells me what it
is - you're going wandering.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.990
You've a message to deliver.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.790
To him.

41:59.840 --> 42:01.780
The Knight of Wands.

42:04.760 --> 42:07.230
You may expect a meeting,

42:07.280 --> 42:10.310
leading to an ordeal of some
sort, perhaps even death.

42:10.360 --> 42:14.230
The cards don't say whether
or not you'll survive.

42:14.280 --> 42:16.790
But regardless, you will
achieve your purpose.

42:16.840 --> 42:19.510
~ Do you know what I am yet?
~ Well, there's nothing here that says

42:19.560 --> 42:22.360
you're anything more
than a charlatan.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.870
Then you won't mind if I tell
a fortune myself then, will you?

42:25.920 --> 42:27.710
My fortune won't interest you.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.070
Not yours, his.

42:30.120 --> 42:33.120
~ Norrell's?
~ He is at a crossroads, your magician.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.870
Let's see which path he chooses.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.320
Shall we?

42:44.480 --> 42:47.480
Someone's left a dirty
thumbprint on't card.

42:54.880 --> 42:58.680
I drew these myself. There's
only one king in the pack.

43:03.600 --> 43:06.070
Tell that to the magician
of Hanover Square.

43:06.120 --> 43:09.840
His past, his present, his future.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.950
He is coming, you know.

43:14.560 --> 43:16.520
The raven is coming.

43:18.960 --> 43:21.560
And his spell is about to be cast.

43:34.440 --> 43:37.350
I do not wish to attend soirees,
dinner parties or salons.

43:37.400 --> 43:40.190
I have offered my services to the
country, they have been declined.

43:40.240 --> 43:41.710
I shall return to Yorkshire.

43:41.760 --> 43:43.700
Good day, gentlemen.

43:46.280 --> 43:48.070
Well, sir, you have your revenge,

43:48.120 --> 43:51.510
~ at least as far as Walter Pole is concerned.
~ Sorry?

43:51.560 --> 43:54.750
Sir Walter's bride
is dead. Poor thing.

43:54.800 --> 43:57.670
A thousand pounds a
year, and quite dead.

43:57.720 --> 44:01.160
~ She only contrived to remain
alive till the end of the week.
~ Dead?

44:02.320 --> 44:04.550
The young lady? That
is most unexpected.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.590
On the contrary, nothing
was more likely.

44:06.640 --> 44:08.870
Sir Walter's need of the
money is quite desperate.

44:08.920 --> 44:11.230
He spent a thousand pounds
on the last election alone.

44:11.280 --> 44:15.230
It's a very dangerous thing, to
bring someone back from the dead.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.880
It has not been done in 300 years.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.550
No, no, I could not attempt it.

44:21.600 --> 44:24.590
Indeed, sir, no-one proposes
that you should.

44:24.640 --> 44:27.550
Well... No, I know the form of it.

44:27.600 --> 44:30.590
But it is precisely the sort of
magic I've set my face against.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.840
It relies so much upon...

44:33.760 --> 44:37.070
Well, that is to say, the outcome,
it is quite unpredictable.

44:37.120 --> 44:40.060
It is quite out of
the magician's power.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.710
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

44:42.760 --> 44:44.110
I shall not even think of it.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.110
No, sir, I understand.

44:46.160 --> 44:48.710
You have in mind a
great act of magic.

44:48.760 --> 44:52.440
A testament to your...
extraordinary powers.

44:53.680 --> 44:57.870
I must say I think the
idea an excellent one.

44:57.920 --> 44:59.390
Should you succeed,

44:59.440 --> 45:02.940
all the Poles in England
will be on your doorstep.

45:03.720 --> 45:06.830
I have laboured all this time
to make magic - my profession -

45:06.880 --> 45:10.510
respectable in the eyes of these
men and then still, they despise me.

45:10.560 --> 45:13.110
Oh, my dear Mr Norrell,

45:13.160 --> 45:16.430
such an opportunity is
unlikely to occur again.

45:16.480 --> 45:20.430
With one stroke, you return
to us that sweet young woman

45:20.480 --> 45:23.840
whose death no-one can hear
of without shedding a tear.

45:25.880 --> 45:29.470
And you re-establish magic
as a power in the realm

45:29.520 --> 45:32.120
for generations to come.

45:34.320 --> 45:37.520
There is scarcely any form
of magic more dangerous.

45:38.720 --> 45:41.590
It is dangerous to
the magician, and...

45:42.280 --> 45:45.630
.. furthermore it is
dangerous to the subject.

45:45.680 --> 45:48.950
But the subject, as
you term her, is dead.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.470
What worse fate can befall her?

45:52.000 --> 45:54.470
And a brave magician, surely...

45:56.760 --> 45:59.430
I will need to send for more books.

46:00.400 --> 46:02.310
I'll make an excellent
landowner, Jeremy.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.910
She will tell me that I will be bored

46:03.960 --> 46:07.310
but I shall tell her about
my plans for alms houses,

46:07.360 --> 46:11.030
and demonstrate my concern for
the plight of the common man.

46:11.080 --> 46:12.310
The common man over there

46:12.360 --> 46:16.460
is attempting to violently accost
the other common man, sir.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.310
Stay back!

46:19.360 --> 46:22.470
~ I don't suppose you brought
a set of pistols, did you?
~ No, sir.

46:22.520 --> 46:25.320
Jeremy, go and fetch
me a large stick.

46:25.760 --> 46:26.790
I say!

46:26.840 --> 46:28.310
You! We are armed and ready.

46:28.360 --> 46:31.230
Sh! Sir, shush.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.310
~ What?
~ You'll wake him up.

46:33.360 --> 46:35.790
~ Who?
~ The man. Under the hedge.

46:35.840 --> 46:37.190
He's a magician.

46:37.240 --> 46:39.150
If you wake a magician
before his time,

46:39.200 --> 46:42.310
his dreams come after
you and haunt you.

46:42.360 --> 46:44.030
He's woken up!

46:46.040 --> 46:47.780
Don't touch him.

46:50.360 --> 46:53.190
~ Knight of wands.
~ What did he say?

46:53.240 --> 46:55.030
Two magicians shall
appear in England.

46:55.080 --> 46:58.780
~ What did he say?
~ The name of one shall be Fearfulness.

46:58.960 --> 47:01.310
The name of the other - Arrogance.

47:01.360 --> 47:05.470
Both will fail. My
name is Vinculus, sir.

47:05.520 --> 47:07.990
For three days now, I have
been walking westward

47:08.040 --> 47:10.750
in search of a man destined
to become a great magician.

47:10.800 --> 47:13.270
Due to certain mystical signs...

47:14.760 --> 47:17.030
.. I can see that it is you.

47:17.080 --> 47:19.230
Two magicians shall
appear in England.

47:19.280 --> 47:21.750
The first shall fear me. The
second shall long to behold me.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.190
The first shall be governed
by thieves and murderers.

47:24.240 --> 47:26.470
The second shall conspire
at his own destruction.

47:26.520 --> 47:28.310
You do not make it
sound very appealing.

47:28.360 --> 47:30.300
Choose someone else.

47:30.880 --> 47:34.710
I did not choose you, magician.

47:34.760 --> 47:36.550
You were chosen long ago.

47:36.600 --> 47:39.550
Well, whoever did the choosing will
be disappointed. I am no magician.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.430
Then buy these two
spells from me, sir.

47:41.480 --> 47:42.950
They'll get you started.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.750
I got them from a great
magician in London.

47:45.800 --> 47:46.990
How much do you want for them?

47:47.040 --> 47:49.590
Seven shillings and
sixpence, sir. Cough up.

47:49.640 --> 47:50.790
All right, all right.

47:50.840 --> 47:54.030
The nameless slave shall
be a king in a strange land.

47:54.080 --> 47:57.430
~ Here, you! Let's have you. Workhouse.
~ That's your lot.
~ Vagrancy.

47:57.480 --> 47:59.830
I'm not a vagrant, sir.

47:59.880 --> 48:01.070
I have money.

48:01.120 --> 48:02.510
Who gave him money?

48:02.560 --> 48:05.430
~ For always and forever...
~ I think it's time we were going, Jeremy.

48:05.480 --> 48:08.870
.. I pray remember me, upon
the moors, beneath the stars.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.230
Good day, gentlemen.

48:10.280 --> 48:12.870
I will return. His
words, sir, not mine.

48:12.920 --> 48:15.720
I will return.

48:18.800 --> 48:21.070
When I take over the management
of my own estate...

48:21.120 --> 48:24.270
You always told me you
hated farming, Jonathan.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.710
Will such a thing do for you?

48:25.760 --> 48:27.390
~ Well, I...
~ You once said

48:27.440 --> 48:29.190
that you would rather
put out your own eyes

48:29.240 --> 48:31.350
than spend one moment
managing the estate.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.950
Very well, I'm going to
study magic. Will that do?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.230
Why on earth would
you want to do that?

48:36.280 --> 48:39.510
I met a man under a hedge who
told me I was a magician.

48:39.560 --> 48:42.070
~ Did you indeed?
~ You do not believe me.
~ No.

48:42.120 --> 48:45.240
On the contrary, it's all of a piece
with your usual way of doing things.

48:46.320 --> 48:48.510
I purchased two spells from
the man under the hedge.

48:48.560 --> 48:50.760
Would you like to see one?

48:52.520 --> 48:55.510
~ Very dirty.
~ We magicians do not regard a little dirt.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.830
Ancient, mysterious
spells such as these.

48:57.880 --> 48:59.390
Second of February?

48:59.440 --> 49:00.910
Three days ago.

49:00.960 --> 49:02.870
Indeed.

49:02.920 --> 49:05.350
"A spell to make an obstinate
man leave London."

49:05.400 --> 49:08.950
"One spell to discover what mine
enemy is doing presently."

49:09.000 --> 49:11.870
Why on earth would you want
to make people leave London?

49:11.920 --> 49:14.430
These are horrible, Jonathan.

49:14.480 --> 49:17.280
I require a mirror
and something dead.

49:18.240 --> 49:20.750
Er, Jeremy, those flowers.

49:20.800 --> 49:23.800
I think we can find you
a mirror, Jonathan.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.750
Now, madam, an occupation.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.390
If I make a success of this,

49:29.440 --> 49:32.180
~ might I then presume...
~ Here we are.

49:33.400 --> 49:36.590
Thank you. And, er, now...

49:36.640 --> 49:40.670
The flowers must be
arranged like so...

49:40.720 --> 49:46.080
and, er, then I draw a circle
on the mirror, like this.

49:48.080 --> 49:49.630
And then I quarter the circle.

49:49.680 --> 49:51.790
Jonathan, where did
you get this nonsense?

49:51.840 --> 49:53.070
From the man under the hedge.

49:53.120 --> 49:56.060
~ Henry, do at least try it.
~ Henry, that...

49:56.720 --> 49:58.920
That is not your ceiling.

50:17.200 --> 50:18.990
Who on earth is he?

50:19.040 --> 50:21.240
And why is he your enemy?

50:21.400 --> 50:23.230
Do you owe him money?

50:23.280 --> 50:24.670
I do not think so.

50:24.720 --> 50:27.310
He could be a banker, it looks
a little like the counting house.

50:27.360 --> 50:30.910
Well, Arabella, good magicians
conjure up fairy spirits

50:30.960 --> 50:32.830
and long-dead kings.

50:32.880 --> 50:36.280
I appear to have summoned
the spirit of a banker.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.990
But at least...

50:39.040 --> 50:40.780
I AM a magician.

51:05.160 --> 51:06.830
I wish with all my heart, Sir Walter,

51:06.880 --> 51:10.870
that I might invite you up with
me to see what it is I do.

51:10.920 --> 51:13.950
But the nature of this
magic demands solitude.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.630
I will, I hope, have the honour
of showing you some magic

51:16.680 --> 51:18.030
on another occasion.

51:18.080 --> 51:19.270
Do not send them away, sir.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.550
Gather as many of them around
the bed as possible.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.110
Impress the servants.

51:23.160 --> 51:25.910
We should have brought some Chinese
powders to throw on the fire.

51:25.960 --> 51:27.390
Bang!

51:27.440 --> 51:30.640
Er, I wish to go to where
Miss Wintertowne is.

51:31.200 --> 51:32.870
This way, sir.

51:40.160 --> 51:44.230
We will stand quietly in the corner,
sir, and afford any assistance.

51:44.280 --> 51:46.280
~ No.
~ But, sir, we...

51:48.480 --> 51:49.960
Gentlemen.

51:56.600 --> 52:00.550
I have in mind to write a play
based on this sorry affair.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.470
I shall call it...

52:03.240 --> 52:05.510
..'Tis Pity She's A Corpse.

53:04.480 --> 53:07.680
Who in the world are you?

53:08.800 --> 53:11.310
I am the greatest
magician of the age.

53:11.360 --> 53:14.360
I... I am the man who is destined
to restore magic to England.

53:19.800 --> 53:24.030
Well, obviously you are that,
or I should not be here.

53:24.080 --> 53:26.030
But who are you?

53:26.080 --> 53:28.360
What magic have you done?

53:30.360 --> 53:32.350
Who was your master?

53:32.400 --> 53:36.550
I had no master, I taught
myself... from books.

53:36.600 --> 53:37.590
Books?

53:37.640 --> 53:39.990
There are some rather helpful
books these days.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.230
At least, they...

53:41.280 --> 53:45.580
They might be helpful, when...
they're considered all together.

53:47.280 --> 53:53.160
Should I agree to restore this
beautiful young woman to life...

53:56.480 --> 53:58.750
.. what would be my reward?

53:59.600 --> 54:02.310
~ What sort of thing...?
~ Oh, my wishes are the most moderate things

54:02.360 --> 54:03.710
in the world.

54:03.760 --> 54:08.470
I simply wish to be able to
aid you in your endeavours.

54:08.520 --> 54:12.960
To advise you in all matters
and to guide your studies.

54:14.080 --> 54:18.030
Oh, and you must take
care to tell the world

54:18.080 --> 54:23.080
that your greatest achievements
are due, in large part, to me.

54:25.200 --> 54:29.310
W... Were I the sort of magician
who entrusts his business

54:29.360 --> 54:31.830
to other persons then I would...

54:32.120 --> 54:36.870
But I fear, unfortunately, that
I have no notion to employ you

54:36.920 --> 54:40.870
or indeed any other member
of your race ever again.

54:40.920 --> 54:42.710
Well...

54:42.760 --> 54:45.230
this is most ungrateful indeed.

54:46.440 --> 54:50.000
Perhaps I would do better
to speak to the other one.

54:53.280 --> 54:56.110
~ The other who?
~ The other magician.

54:56.160 --> 54:58.270
No, there is no other magician.
I am the only one.

54:58.320 --> 55:00.990
Of course there is another magician.

55:01.040 --> 55:04.750
He is your dearest friend
in all the world.

55:04.800 --> 55:06.670
I have no friends.

55:08.040 --> 55:10.180
So you will not help me?

55:10.600 --> 55:12.400
I must confess...

55:13.040 --> 55:14.750
.. that in recent centuries,

55:14.800 --> 55:22.800
I have grown somewhat tired of the
society of my cousins and servants.

55:25.560 --> 55:28.830
I have need of new companions

55:28.880 --> 55:34.560
and this young woman would be
a charming companion indeed.

55:43.440 --> 55:47.910
Grant me half her life
and the deal is done.

55:47.960 --> 55:51.230
~ What would her friends and family say...?
~ Half a life

55:51.280 --> 55:53.220
is better than none.

55:53.880 --> 55:55.230
How long is a life?

55:55.280 --> 55:57.420
How long would you like?

55:59.080 --> 56:02.790
Well, let us suppose that she might
have lived until she was...

56:02.840 --> 56:03.980
94.

56:05.320 --> 56:08.190
And she is 19. That's
another 75 years.

56:09.960 --> 56:11.700
75 years, then.

56:13.200 --> 56:16.520
Exactly half of which belongs to me.

56:23.400 --> 56:26.440
~ Shall we sign something?
~ No.

56:28.200 --> 56:29.340
No.

56:31.120 --> 56:34.670
I should take something of the
lady's to signify my claim.

56:34.720 --> 56:37.230
~ One of her rings?
~ No.

56:37.280 --> 56:39.480
Ah... I have it.

56:43.640 --> 56:45.550
And then you will go back.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.140
I am sorry?

56:48.360 --> 56:51.070
After you've finished the spell,

56:51.120 --> 56:54.120
you will go away not
to come back any more.

56:54.960 --> 56:58.600
You need never see me again.

57:07.120 --> 57:09.710
Emma! Miss Wintertowne.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.900
What are you doing, man?

57:14.000 --> 57:15.030
Open this door!

57:15.080 --> 57:18.080
For the love of Christ,
sir, open this door.

57:21.680 --> 57:23.550
What have you done?

57:28.320 --> 57:30.320
Oh, my Lord, my Lord.

57:31.400 --> 57:33.230
Emma.

57:33.280 --> 57:35.150
You've been wicked.

57:35.720 --> 57:39.420
It is not right you did not
tell me how poorly I was.

57:39.880 --> 57:43.030
I do believe for a moment
I may have been dead,

57:43.080 --> 57:46.920
though I do not seem to be
dead presently. How unusual.

57:49.200 --> 57:51.630
And Walter, I rather like
you in black. Let us dance.

57:51.680 --> 57:53.510
Emma...

57:53.560 --> 57:55.100
Your finger.

57:59.360 --> 58:02.510
I don't feel it. Mmm. Dance with me.

58:06.120 --> 58:07.310
A miracle!

58:07.360 --> 58:11.910
The magician of Hanover Square has
restored the young lady to life.

58:11.960 --> 58:14.830
My dear friend, Mr Norrell.

58:14.880 --> 58:18.630
He has performed that which
medicine could not.

58:18.680 --> 58:20.270
Physicians had abandoned her.

58:20.320 --> 58:25.400
The poor young lady... Restored
to life and to dance!
