Bye. Good news, everybody,
the guy still has the sink

00:25.192 --> 00:26.750
and it's a really good price.

00:26.769 --> 00:27.842
Uh, I'm gonna go check it out,

00:27.862 --> 00:29.194
and unless something is terribly

00:29.421 --> 00:31.104
wrong with it,
we'll have a new, slightly used

00:31.257 --> 00:34.033
-kitchen sink for
the restaurant.
-All right!

00:34.184 --> 00:35.683
This is all happening so fast.

00:35.778 --> 00:37.611
Yeah, if you told me
I was gonna wake up today

00:37.763 --> 00:40.873
and we were getting new sink, I
would have been all, "What?"

00:41.066 --> 00:42.708
I know. It's very exciting.

00:42.859 --> 00:44.117
It's deeper than
the one we have now,

00:44.270 --> 00:46.103
and it's got rounded corners,

00:46.121 --> 00:47.454
-so it's easier to clean.
-Like me.

00:47.606 --> 00:49.122
It's basically
the sink I've wanted

00:49.216 --> 00:50.941
-my whole life.
-Dream big, Dad.

00:50.959 --> 00:52.959
The only problem is I don't
think it will fit in the back

00:53.112 --> 00:55.462
of our car unless
I rip out the back seat,

00:55.614 --> 00:58.724

that's, uh, where the kids go.

-Bridgehurst.

It's a couple hours away.

it'll fit in our car.

-This is your lucky day!

I'm driving through
Bridgehurst to do a job

01:22.991 --> 01:24.491
for Mr. Fischoeder today.

01:24.643 --> 01:27.811
He sold that giant ventriloquist
dummy head from the old funhouse

01:27.830 --> 01:30.480
to a guy who wants to use it
for his mini golf course.

01:30.574 --> 01:33.241

Didn't he have a name?

01:33.260 --> 01:35.260
-Big Dummy.
-It's a beautiful name.

01:35.412 --> 01:38.004
Anyway, I just loaded it
onto a flatbed trailer

01:38.099 --> 01:39.656

and I'm gonna drive it out

01:39.749 --> 01:40.991
to the golf course guy.

01:41.009 --> 01:43.009
He's just one town over
from Bridgehurst.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.511
So you can come with me
and throw your sink

01:44.663 --> 01:45.996

-Thanks.
-What are you talking
about, Bob?

01:53.948 --> 01:57.174
Teddy's got a truck, you've got
a giant sink. This is perfect.

01:57.343 --> 02:00.935
I mean, Linda, I don't
want to impose on Teddy.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.770

Uh, Lin, can I talk to you
in the kitchen, please?

Uh, I don't want to spend
two hours in a car with Teddy.

02:09.705 --> 02:12.689
I mean, I don't want to spend
two hours in a car with anyone.

02:12.708 --> 02:15.968
And with Teddy,
it's just so much talking.

02:16.119 --> 02:17.878
Come on, Bobby.
Take the ride.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.972

use the company.

02:20.123 --> 02:22.866
-He's a lonely guy.
-(sighs) Okay, fine.

02:22.885 --> 02:24.125
But I'm bringing a book.

02:24.219 --> 02:25.644
You know we don't have books.

02:25.795 --> 02:28.555
So you're sure Big Dummy
never comes to life?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.040
I mean, pretty sure.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.061

02:35.214 --> 02:36.730
Y-You guys are freaking me out.

07:25.261 --> 07:26.945
Yeah, but I don't do it
for the gold.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.781
I do it for the quality time
with my lady: Mother Nature.

07:29.974 --> 07:31.116
I don't have a girlfriend.

07:31.343 --> 07:33.677
-Which is nuts. Look at you.
-Huh. Anyway, uh,

07:33.695 --> 07:35.195
we should definitely get going.

07:35.347 --> 07:37.180
Uh, so please take this money
for the hot dogs.

07:37.199 --> 07:39.124
Don't forget,
you're worthy of love.

07:39.351 --> 07:41.126
<i>TEDDY:</i>
<i>Hey, can you even eat hot dogs?</i>

07:41.277 --> 07:42.961
Why wouldn't I be able
to eat a hot dog?

07:43.188 --> 07:44.278
You're a burger guy.

07:44.372 --> 07:46.022
Hot dogs and burgers
are enemies, right?

07:46.041 --> 07:47.707
No. I-I think they're friends.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.450
<i> -TEDDY: Frenemies?</i>
<i> -Oh, my God,</i>
<i> are we stopping again?</i>

07:49.544 --> 07:51.695
This place has the
cleanest bathrooms for miles.

07:51.788 --> 07:53.621
<i> I liked that hot dog,</i>

07:53.715 --> 07:55.122
but it did not like me.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.700
-Oh. Terrific.
-You sure you don't need to go?

07:56.702 --> 07:59.719
-No.
-No, you're not sure,
or no, you don't have to go?

07:59.871 --> 08:01.813
-I don't have to go!
-Okay, relax.

08:01.965 --> 08:03.540
Can I borrow a couple of bucks?

08:03.633 --> 08:05.800
This place makes you buy
something to use the restrooms,

08:05.819 --> 08:07.486
and I only have twenties.

08:07.637 --> 08:10.230
-So use a twenty.
-They don't like breaking
big bills, Bob.

08:10.382 --> 08:13.216
I don't want to be Mr. Big Shot
"Can you break a twenty?"

08:13.309 --> 08:14.067
Mm.

08:14.219 --> 08:15.327
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> So, you ladies are</i>

08:15.554 --> 08:17.144
in some sort of group,
it looks like.

08:17.239 --> 08:19.164
Yeah! We're the Bon Viv-aunts.

08:19.315 --> 08:21.725
We're all aunts
who get together once a month

08:21.818 --> 08:23.001
and do something fun.

08:23.152 --> 08:24.410
'Cause we don't have kids
and can do stuff.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.320
And this month your fun thing
is coming here?

08:26.340 --> 08:28.673
Uh, no. We're going go-carting
after this.

08:28.825 --> 08:32.085
Oh. Well, look over the menu and
one of my professional children

08:32.179 --> 08:33.678
will be right over
to take your orders.

08:33.905 --> 08:35.238
-M'kay?
-Okay.

08:35.257 --> 08:37.682
Just so you know,
a few more of us may trickle in.

08:37.909 --> 08:39.000
Oh, great.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.519
The more Bon Viv-aunts,
the merrier.

08:40.746 --> 08:42.187
Kids, follow me.

08:42.338 --> 08:44.523
-Family meeting.
-GENE: Should we try to get Dad
on a Zoom?

08:44.599 --> 08:46.266
Okay, now we're slammed
out there,

08:46.418 --> 08:48.360
so we're gonna get
these people fed.

08:48.511 --> 08:50.845
-Kids, are you listening?
-No. Is that bad?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.197
Hey, hey, pay attention.

08:52.424 --> 08:54.181
We're gonna refill waters,
collect money,

08:54.201 --> 08:56.517
give correct change,
and say, "Thank you for coming."

08:56.537 --> 08:59.020
Got it. "Thank you for coming."
Um, I'll do it better.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.539
And we're gonna push
the burger of the day,

09:00.690 --> 09:02.448
and we're gonna ask,
"Do you want fries with that?"

09:02.543 --> 09:04.617
Because that's what I would do
if I was out there.

09:04.770 --> 09:07.045
But I'm back here today,
so you got to be me, all right?

09:07.272 --> 09:09.105
-Costume change!
-We'll do our best.

09:09.198 --> 09:11.383
-Which, as you know,
is not great.
-All right, all right.

09:11.534 --> 09:13.718
Whoever sells
the most burgers of the day

09:13.945 --> 09:16.721
and the most fries gets to be...

09:16.873 --> 09:18.039
Employee of the Day!

09:18.133 --> 09:20.225
-Which has a cash prize?
-No.

09:20.376 --> 09:23.136
-Any prize?
-The prize is being
the Employee of the Day.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.230
Even Bus-Tub Jenga has a prize.

09:25.381 --> 09:27.232
Yeah, not having to clean up
Bus-Tub Jenga.

09:27.383 --> 09:30.143
Okay, fine!
Whoever sells the most gets...

09:30.237 --> 09:33.405
a 20-second pull
from the soft serve machine, ah?

09:33.556 --> 09:35.407
-Holy...
-Whoa.
-Really?

09:35.558 --> 09:37.409
-How about that?
-A 20-second pull?

09:37.560 --> 09:39.986
-That's an eternity.
-That could fill my whole body.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.563
Wait, can we do it, like,
straight from the nozzle

09:42.583 --> 09:43.990
into our mouths?

09:44.142 --> 09:46.400
No! Too many people
have died that way. I assume.

09:46.494 --> 09:48.569
That's why it's so tantalizing--
it's forbidden.

09:48.663 --> 09:50.422
I-I don't need to be
under the nozzle.

09:50.573 --> 09:52.740
We're talking about, like,
a crap-load of ice cream.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.742
-So I'm in.
-Fine.
-Me, too.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.927
Okay, good. Now, get out there.

09:56.079 --> 09:57.837
Leave it all on the field.
No mercy.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.155
Pep talk! Go!

09:59.174 --> 10:01.841
What is taking him so long?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.843
Oh, Tupperware!

10:03.937 --> 10:06.587
-Oh, this again?
-Come on!

10:06.607 --> 10:08.106
(Bonnie and Teddy laughing)

10:08.333 --> 10:11.776
Hey, Teddy, uh, sorry,
but we should really get going.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.095
Okay. Just let me
go to the bathroom first.

10:14.189 --> 10:15.429
Wait, you haven't gone
to the bathroom yet?

10:15.523 --> 10:18.617
Eh. I don't know how to say this
in mixed company, Bob,

10:18.768 --> 10:20.360
but it changed its mind
a few times.

10:20.512 --> 10:23.104
-It sounds like a fickle pickle.
-Bob, Bonnie. Bonnie, Bob.

10:23.198 --> 10:25.682
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Bonnie owns the place.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.441
That's her new tow truck.
Pretty sweet, huh?

10:27.461 --> 10:30.019
See the boom on that thing?
Give me a break with that winch.

10:30.113 --> 10:32.613
Yeah, that's a really...
that's a really great boom.

10:32.707 --> 10:34.115
I'm happy with the boom.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.542
Speaking of booms, Teddy,
do you want to... (whistles)

10:36.695 --> 10:39.220
Right.
Okay, let's give this a shot.

10:42.476 --> 10:46.035
So, I might just go wait
in the...

10:46.204 --> 10:47.812
TEDDY:
Bob's a small business owner,
too!

10:48.039 --> 10:49.981
You-you guys can talk
about that.

10:50.208 --> 10:53.042
-Oh, really?
-No, Teddy, don't do that.

10:53.061 --> 10:55.044
Don't-don't call
through the bathroom door.

10:55.138 --> 10:56.321
It's not necessary.

10:56.548 --> 10:58.047
Oh, Bob, pick out a gum for me.

10:58.141 --> 10:59.716
I-I didn't buy anything yet.

10:59.734 --> 11:02.476
Oh, don't worry about that,
Teddy. This one's on me.

11:02.570 --> 11:03.644
Nope, rules are rules.

11:03.738 --> 11:05.221
Bob, read me the gums they have.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.740
I don't like cinnamon
or mint or berry

11:07.834 --> 11:09.242
or anything that's too chewy.

11:09.394 --> 11:11.336
I'm gonna go wait in the truck.
Nice to meet you. Bye.

11:11.563 --> 11:12.671
Bobby! The gum!

11:12.822 --> 11:14.005
(yawns)

11:14.157 --> 11:16.216
So, what's the weirdest thing
you ever towed?

11:20.329 --> 11:22.013
Louise, no. Bring it back.
That's Gene's cheeseburger

11:22.240 --> 11:23.682
-well done.
-Then where's
my no-cheese medium?

11:23.758 --> 11:24.924
There it is.

11:25.076 --> 11:26.685
Tina, bring it back,
bring it back.

11:26.836 --> 11:27.927
-Uh, sorry.
-Oh, uh...

11:28.079 --> 11:29.929
Wait, I had a cheeseburger
well done?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.505
-Gene!
-All these burgers look
the same.

11:31.599 --> 11:32.857
Should we make them
different shapes?

11:33.084 --> 11:34.600
Is this a good time
to get an update

11:34.753 --> 11:37.028
on who's winning the contest
and how it's me?

11:37.180 --> 11:39.272
Oh, hold on, let me check.
No! You're all losing!

11:39.424 --> 11:41.441
-What?!
-But I just sold
a burger of the day.

11:41.593 --> 11:42.867
And fries, I think.

11:43.019 --> 11:44.185
And then you gave it
to the wrong person.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.204
These Bon Viv-aunts are
so high-maintenance.

11:46.355 --> 11:48.689
They insist on getting
the food that they ordered.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.208
More like Bon Diva-aunts.

11:50.359 --> 11:52.210
Okay, you know what?
Here's what's gonna happen.

11:52.361 --> 11:54.195
I'm coming out there.
I'm gonna run food,

11:54.214 --> 11:56.122
I'm gonna take orders,
and I'm still gonna cook.

11:56.274 --> 11:58.608
What about Employee of the Day?
And ice cream of the mouth?

11:58.626 --> 12:01.553
Ha! I bet I can outsell
all three of you combined.

12:01.704 --> 12:03.296
So I'm entering the contest.

12:03.448 --> 12:05.131
And when I win,
you have to watch me

12:05.225 --> 12:07.133
eat the ice cream
in front of you. Huh?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.619
-(all gasp)
-From the nozzle!

12:09.621 --> 12:10.395
(all gasp)

12:10.546 --> 12:11.804
You said we weren't allowed!

12:11.898 --> 12:13.473
You're still not allowed,
'cause you're gonna lose.

12:13.625 --> 12:16.960
But if we win, all three of us
get ice cream off the nozzle.

12:17.053 --> 12:18.644
Yeah, you can have
that sad dream.

12:18.797 --> 12:20.221
That'll never happen.

12:20.315 --> 12:22.315
You've made a powerful enemy,
Linda Belcher!

12:22.467 --> 12:26.152
Okay, uh, looks like
we take the next left,

12:26.304 --> 12:28.805
and the diner
where I'm gonna get the sink

12:28.823 --> 12:30.139
should be right there.
That's it.

12:30.233 --> 12:31.916
You don't have to hold
that window shut right now.

12:32.068 --> 12:33.234
We're not going fast.

12:33.402 --> 12:34.994
That's good.
It definitely hurts

12:35.088 --> 12:37.814
to hold it shut
this whole time.

12:37.832 --> 12:39.148
Okay, thanks.
Sorry again

12:39.317 --> 12:41.000
for being so much later
than we talked about.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.911
He, uh, he stopped many times.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.746
Ah, that's fine. Enjoy the sink.

12:45.766 --> 12:46.931
-I will.
-Okay, then.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.083
See, Teddy?
That's how you run an errand.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.510
No small talk, no fuss,

12:50.662 --> 12:52.845
just a clean,
efficient exchange.

12:52.998 --> 12:54.773
Hey, you. New used sink.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.849
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

12:57.002 --> 12:58.351
Let's get us home.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.778
-Teddy, is that you?
-Gerry?

12:59.929 --> 13:01.613
Why-why is this happening to me?

13:01.764 --> 13:03.172
What are you doing here?

13:03.266 --> 13:05.099
I'm running Big Dummy here
up to the mini golf course,

13:05.118 --> 13:07.510
and I'm also delivering
this giant head.

13:07.529 --> 13:08.528
(chuckles)

13:08.729 --> 13:10.271
-Ow.
-Ah, just kidding.

13:10.365 --> 13:11.772
Bob, Gerry. Gerry, Bob.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.866
Gerry here has an antique store
not too far from here.

13:14.019 --> 13:16.035
I built him some shelves
a while ago.

13:16.187 --> 13:17.945
I double-checked
to make sure they were level,

13:17.964 --> 13:20.114
so the worn-out old plates
didn't fall off.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.707
They're not worn out,
they're antiques.

13:21.802 --> 13:22.801
It's what we sell.

13:23.028 --> 13:25.028
(chuckles)
Gerry.

13:25.196 --> 13:27.030
Hey, do you still play the lute?

13:27.123 --> 13:29.198
I sure dute.
Switched to electric, though.

13:29.217 --> 13:32.035
Electric lute? Ooh,
I'd love to hear that sometime.

13:32.053 --> 13:34.461
-Well, you, sir, are in luck.
-Oh, no.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.648
My metal band is practicing
in the garage right now.

13:36.799 --> 13:38.132
Called Iron Prostate.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.818
The singer is a urologist.

13:40.045 --> 13:42.712
-No. No. No.
-Yes to all of that. (chuckles)

13:42.730 --> 13:44.213
Uh, yeah, that sounds so good.

13:44.232 --> 13:46.232
But we should
probably get going.

13:46.309 --> 13:47.884
Bob, come on, just ten minutes.

13:47.902 --> 13:49.068
15 minutes tops.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.478
It's our first practice ever,
so...

13:51.498 --> 13:54.815
-should be fun.
-Great, great,
great, great, great.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.059
Hello, Tokyo!

13:56.152 --> 13:58.002
We're pretending
we're playing in Tokyo.

13:58.154 --> 13:59.504
♪<i> Yeah...!</i> ♪

13:59.581 --> 14:02.340
♪<i> Ba-la-la-la, da-na-na,</i>
<i> da-na-na, la-la-la!</i> ♪

14:02.567 --> 14:03.991
Man, that band was great!

14:04.085 --> 14:05.677
You're quiet, Bob.
Are you thinking

14:05.828 --> 14:07.995
-about what a fun day
this has been?
-Mm-hmm.

14:08.089 --> 14:10.406
-Window, Bob.
-I really hate this window.

14:10.425 --> 14:13.000
Next stop, dropping off
Big Dummy, then home.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.244
-Great.
-And one quick stop before that.

14:15.263 --> 14:17.096
-Wait, what? No. No.
-I swear it'll be fast.

14:17.248 --> 14:19.340
-Please no.
-Okay, not<i> fast</i> fast,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.751
but I'm literally just
dropping off these Tupperwares.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.344
Did you get all the lids on?

14:23.421 --> 14:25.104
I meant to, but I had to hold
the window, so...

14:25.198 --> 14:27.681
Okay, I'll hold the window shut.
You do the lids.

14:27.850 --> 14:30.718
-(grunting)
-No, stop. Teddy.
I... I will do it.

14:30.778 --> 14:32.945
Thanks for coming by!

14:33.098 --> 14:34.873
Let me top off your waters, hon.

14:34.949 --> 14:36.708
Here you go.
Burger of the day and fries.

14:36.859 --> 14:39.102
-Oh, fork!
-Wow. Thank you.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.713
Eh, fork-get about it.
(chuckles)

14:41.864 --> 14:43.697
How the hell are we supposed
to keep up with her?

14:43.791 --> 14:46.533
-She's a machine!
-She's some sort
of restaurant wizard.

14:46.628 --> 14:47.960
Or a restaurant witch.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.279
What the hell are you guys
doing just standing here?

14:50.298 --> 14:53.040
We've got a contest to win.
Stop bussing and start selling.

14:53.134 --> 14:55.542
I'm paralyzed by a combination
of fear and awe.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.969
I'm just tired.

14:57.122 --> 14:58.971
Come on, there's three of us
and one of her.

14:59.124 --> 15:00.214
We can do this.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.125
We're talking
about getting ice cream

15:02.143 --> 15:04.569
-straight from the nozzle!
-Ah, you're right.

15:04.796 --> 15:07.071
I'll do whatever it takes to get
my mouth under that thing!

15:07.223 --> 15:09.298
-That's the spirit.
-Same here.

15:09.392 --> 15:10.909
So, take Mom out? Too far?

15:10.985 --> 15:12.911
Maybe. We'll see. Let's go!

15:13.062 --> 15:14.804
<i> TEDDY:</i>
<i> I'll be the first to admit it,</i>

15:14.822 --> 15:16.915
it took a little longer
than I thought to get here.

15:17.142 --> 15:18.808
Only twice as long as you said.

15:18.826 --> 15:20.476
I-I didn't notice it at all.

15:20.569 --> 15:22.903
There it is! I'm just gonna
hand these to him,

15:22.997 --> 15:24.571
<i> and I'll be right back--</i>
<i> no chitchat.</i>

15:24.591 --> 15:26.315
Even though he was very excited
about this cornbread.

15:26.409 --> 15:28.409
And it's the only time
I've been paid in cornbread.

15:28.503 --> 15:30.319
And I have a lot of questions
about the cornbread.

15:30.413 --> 15:33.080
But it-it's okay,
I'll follow up with him later.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.491
Hello, sink.
Are you having fun back there?

15:35.510 --> 15:38.828
I kind of wish I was riding
with you and not that man.

15:38.921 --> 15:40.939
I can't wait
to rinse things in you.

15:41.090 --> 15:42.256
I hope that didn't sound crude.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.258
-Why do you still have those?
-He's not home.

15:44.385 --> 15:46.352
All the lights are off, and he's
not answering the doorbell.

15:46.521 --> 15:49.338
It's okay, we can just wait
in the truck for a little bit.

15:49.432 --> 15:51.507
No, Teddy, just leave
the Tupperware at the door,

15:51.676 --> 15:52.842
and let's go.

15:52.935 --> 15:54.601
Leave it at the door?
Are you crazy?

15:54.621 --> 15:55.769
Someone might steal it!

15:55.863 --> 15:57.196
No one's gonna steal Tupperware!

15:57.348 --> 15:59.106
Ah, I'll just bring it back
some other time.

15:59.275 --> 16:00.850
Hey, you can come with me
if you want.

16:00.868 --> 16:01.775
No!

16:01.795 --> 16:02.794
I mean, no, thank you.

16:03.021 --> 16:04.445
Suit yourself. So, uh,

16:04.464 --> 16:06.780
you want to hop out and help me
turn this thing around?

16:06.800 --> 16:08.282
-Wait, what?
-It's gonna be tight.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.543
Probably a five-point turn,
maybe seven.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.361
I could use your eyes out there.

16:12.380 --> 16:13.529
Okay, sure.

16:13.622 --> 16:15.289
Call out directions
and rotate your hands

16:15.366 --> 16:17.366
like you're turning
the steering wheel, okay?

16:17.385 --> 16:19.644
-How is that helpful?
-It's just simpler that way.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.403
Like you're operating my hands.

16:21.464 --> 16:23.147
Do you want to practice
a little first?

16:23.299 --> 16:26.300
-No, Teddy, I think I got it.
-You sure?

16:26.377 --> 16:28.302
These things can be
pretty stressful in the moment.

16:28.396 --> 16:30.546
-I'm good, Teddy.
-Okay.

16:30.565 --> 16:32.882
All right,
cut the wheels this way.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.233
Okay, stop.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.219
-Now this way.
-Wait, which way?

16:36.237 --> 16:38.237
You need to turn the wheels
to the right,

16:38.389 --> 16:40.072
so I'm turning to the right,
like you said.

16:40.225 --> 16:41.574
So turn the wheel
to the right, Teddy.

16:41.726 --> 16:44.836
Yeah, but I'm looking at you
in the mirror, so it's reversed.

16:45.063 --> 16:46.653
Just turn the wheels right!

16:46.673 --> 16:48.581
-This way?
-No!

16:48.657 --> 16:50.416
BOB:
Stop! Stop! Stop!

16:50.568 --> 16:51.825
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

16:51.994 --> 16:53.753
No, no, no! Big Dummy!

16:53.905 --> 16:55.680
Great! Now we're stuck.

16:55.907 --> 16:58.016
-Oh, my God.
-And look at Big Dummy!

16:58.125 --> 16:59.742
What did you do, Bob?

16:59.911 --> 17:01.853
Me? I did it
the way you told me to!

17:02.080 --> 17:03.095
No, you didn't, Bob.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.914
This is why we
should have practiced.

17:04.932 --> 17:07.191
Well, I shouldn't have been
giving you directions at all.

17:07.343 --> 17:08.842
I shouldn't have even come
on this trip.

17:08.936 --> 17:10.177
I should have just driven myself

17:10.196 --> 17:12.271
and tied the sink
to the top of my stupid car.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.090
Yeah, well, why didn't you, Bob?

17:14.108 --> 17:16.850
-Because I felt sorry
for you, okay?
-What?

17:16.928 --> 17:18.685
This isn't a boy ride, Teddy!

17:18.705 --> 17:20.705
I'm your pity passenger!

17:20.856 --> 17:22.206
What's all the ruckus? (screams)

17:26.362 --> 17:28.028
Hey, Mr. Estock.
It's me, Teddy.

17:28.197 --> 17:30.606
Sorry I dropped a giant
ventriloquist head on your lawn.

17:30.699 --> 17:31.865
I mean, Bob kind of did.

17:32.034 --> 17:33.367
I came to return
your Tupperware.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.369
This is Bob,
who I thought was my friend,

17:35.388 --> 17:38.614
but I guess
he's just my pity passenger.

17:38.633 --> 17:39.799
Oh. Hello.

17:39.951 --> 17:41.467
I thought I was
your friend, Teddy,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.619
but friends don't hold
friends hostage in their truck

17:43.712 --> 17:47.790
while they talk to every single
person at every single exit!

17:47.809 --> 17:49.292
And now we're stuck here.

17:49.385 --> 17:51.811
Sorry, Mr. Estock, it seems
like a nice neighborhood.

17:51.963 --> 17:53.554
It was nice, until this.

17:53.648 --> 17:55.981
(groans)
I'll call and get a tow.

17:56.134 --> 17:57.466
His eyes follow me.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.136
(quietly):
It knows what I'm thinking.

18:00.154 --> 18:01.487
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> ...one for us,</i>

18:01.581 --> 18:02.988
and the last one's Mom's.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.158
Damn it! Mom beat us by
one frickin' burger of the day.

18:06.327 --> 18:06.918
No...!

18:07.087 --> 18:08.252
We almost had it all.

18:08.479 --> 18:10.996
We worked so hard, and for what?

18:11.149 --> 18:13.257
-Aw.
-GENE: Just
a well-run restaurant

18:13.409 --> 18:15.151
and a bunch
of satisfied bon fa-faunts.

18:15.169 --> 18:19.004
Oh, uh, wait a minute, uh,
I didn't sell these fries.

18:19.157 --> 18:20.247
Gene sold these fries.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.249
It was my table,
but they got his attention

18:22.268 --> 18:23.935
and added another order
of fries.

18:24.086 --> 18:26.162
Yeah, they called me Pumpkin
and I liked it.

18:26.180 --> 18:27.772
Everyone call me Pumpkin
from now on.

18:27.923 --> 18:29.923
So technically,
Gene gets that sale.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.500
-You guys win.
-We do?

18:31.519 --> 18:32.610
Yeah. It's official.

18:32.761 --> 18:34.337
You're the Employees of the Day.

18:34.430 --> 18:36.280
-Yay!
-We win, you lose!

18:36.432 --> 18:38.783
(chanting):
We win, you lose!
We win, you lose!

18:39.010 --> 18:41.344
-Okay, okay.
-Hey, don't feel too bad, Mom.

18:41.362 --> 18:43.287
-You were pretty amazing today.
-Yeah?

18:43.439 --> 18:45.272
Yeah, we thought
you were the laid-back one,

18:45.291 --> 18:47.516
but it turns out that's just
'cause you make it look easy.

18:47.535 --> 18:49.794
You're actually a beast.
A gorgeous beast.

18:49.945 --> 18:51.537
We should be calling<i> you</i>
Pumpkin.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.189
Aw. Me, Pumpkin.

18:53.207 --> 18:55.374
-I said "should."
-You cooked, you served,

18:55.468 --> 18:57.710
and you didn't gripe about it
like Dad does.

18:57.879 --> 18:58.970
Do we need him? Cut him out?

18:59.197 --> 19:00.304
Split the money four ways?

19:00.456 --> 19:02.698
Nah, it'd be too hard
to change the sign.

19:02.791 --> 19:03.975
Hey, go get your ice cream.

19:04.126 --> 19:05.868
-Oh! Whoa! Aah!
-Nozzle!
-Gimme!

19:05.887 --> 19:07.979
<i> -TINA: Let me in there!</i>
<i> -GENE: Ah, yum-yum-yum-</i>
<i> yum-yum-yum...</i>

19:08.130 --> 19:09.889
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> Gene, slow down!</i>
<i> You're gonna choke!</i>

19:10.041 --> 19:11.874
<i>GENE:</i>
<i>I don't care! Yum-yum-yum-yum...</i>

19:11.893 --> 19:13.709
Yeah, you should be good to go.

19:13.728 --> 19:15.820
Thanks, Bonnie.
Hey, remember when I asked you

19:15.971 --> 19:17.822
what's the weirdest thing
you ever towed?

19:17.899 --> 19:19.157
It's gotta be this now, right?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.066
Nope.
Still the mobile tattoo parlor.

19:21.235 --> 19:23.161
Lot of complaints
about those tattoos.

19:23.388 --> 19:25.554
-Not from this gal, though.
-Hey, what is that?

19:25.648 --> 19:27.147
It's Blinky from Pac-Man.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.392
Ha-ha!
I bet there's a story there.

19:29.410 --> 19:30.651
(Bob whimpers)

19:30.745 --> 19:32.578
Me and my brother used to play
Pac-Man together.

19:32.730 --> 19:33.671
He got "Clyde."

19:33.898 --> 19:35.322
-Ah, that's nice.
-Oh, Teddy,

19:35.341 --> 19:37.341
you like asking people
about themselves, don't you?

19:37.493 --> 19:38.825
Well, yeah.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.737
-People are interesting.
-Teddy fixed the porch for me.

19:41.830 --> 19:44.182
He wasn't here half the day,
and he got me talking

19:44.333 --> 19:46.409
about my late wife's
cornbread recipe.

19:46.502 --> 19:50.003
-How was it, by the way?
-TEDDY: It was really somethin'.

19:50.081 --> 19:52.190
-I ran out of corn.
-That explains it.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.691
Well, we better get going.

19:53.918 --> 19:55.359
Why are you staring, Bob?

19:55.586 --> 19:56.861
Hey, Teddy? I...

19:57.012 --> 19:58.938
I-I want to say something.

19:59.090 --> 20:01.607
I guess maybe
I thought you were lonely,

20:01.759 --> 20:03.926
but you're really not, at all.

20:03.945 --> 20:05.945
You make friends
wherever you go,

20:06.113 --> 20:08.689
and you're so interested
in people, all the time.

20:08.783 --> 20:10.857
I, um,
am never interested in people.

20:10.952 --> 20:13.044
I-I don't like people...
that much.

20:13.195 --> 20:15.938
Not you guys, though.
You-you seem great.

20:16.031 --> 20:18.049
But I don't really like that
about myself,

20:18.200 --> 20:21.368
and I guess I really admire that
about you.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.888
Oh, thanks. And hey,
don't beat yourself up, Bob.

20:24.039 --> 20:25.965
You are like that, kind of,

20:26.117 --> 20:27.299
with the six people
you already know.

20:27.452 --> 20:29.969
But yeah, maybe you
could branch out a bit.

20:30.121 --> 20:32.045
I'll try.
Thank you again, Connie.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.065
-It's Bonnie.
-Right. Sorry.

20:34.216 --> 20:35.975
<i> TEDDY:</i>
<i> Hey, Bob, hear me out.</i>

20:36.127 --> 20:37.401
Before we drop off Big Dummy,

20:37.553 --> 20:39.070
do you want to try
the best beef jerky

20:39.239 --> 20:42.573
-you'll ever have in your life?
-That actually sounds great.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.133
Yes! It's just up ahead.

20:44.226 --> 20:46.244
Now, the guy who runs
this place-- real character--

20:46.395 --> 20:47.820
he has a hook for a hand.

-Don't stare at it, okay?
-Okay.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.824
Just kidding.
He loves to talk about it.
