WEBVTT

00:09.730 --> 00:13.839
First I was afraid
I was petrified

00:15.130 --> 00:18.780
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side

00:19.929 --> 00:24.320
But then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong

00:24.730 --> 00:29.149
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

00:30.730 --> 00:32.979
You know what I'm talking about.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.520
In this city, you better
learn to get along...

00:36.130 --> 00:37.880
...for L.A.'s got it all.

00:38.530 --> 00:41.759
Glamour and grit,
big breaks and heartaches.

00:42.130 --> 00:43.359
Sweet young lovers...

00:43.929 --> 00:47.189
...and nasty hairy fiends
who suck out your brains.

00:47.530 --> 00:51.179
It's the big wacky variety show
called Los Angeles.

00:52.929 --> 00:56.789
You never know what's next.
Let's admit it, folks...

00:57.729 --> 00:59.340
...isn't that why we love it?

00:59.530 --> 01:02.829
I'll survive
I will survive

01:03.729 --> 01:05.689
Hey, hey

01:07.329 --> 01:09.680
But why, Johnny? Why?

01:11.530 --> 01:13.670
- It's over.
- No, I love you!

01:15.129 --> 01:17.480
I gave you everything, didn't I?

01:18.129 --> 01:21.540
- Yeah, and it's time to move on.
- You can't!

01:22.329 --> 01:26.540
You're everything to me.
I'm nothing without you. Nothing!

01:28.930 --> 01:29.629
Ow.

01:30.730 --> 01:32.310
Hey, ow! She hit me!

01:33.129 --> 01:37.310
I added that myself.
She's spineless, begging this creep--

01:37.930 --> 01:41.900
That was just amazing.
You were Eleanor, body and soul.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.170
Where does she hit me?

01:44.530 --> 01:48.079
You're on fire! It's exciting.
Let's do it again.

01:48.730 --> 01:51.329
Put the focus on how conflicted you--

01:52.930 --> 01:53.939
Cordelia?

01:54.730 --> 01:56.409
Sorry. Duty calls.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:10.689 --> 02:13.080
Sorry, lads. I'll have a rematch...

02:16.090 --> 02:17.979
...another time.

02:23.889 --> 02:24.830
Ow!

02:34.330 --> 02:35.199
Can I help you?

02:37.930 --> 02:40.530
The club's for members
and guests only.

02:40.930 --> 02:41.939
I might join.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.830
You can't come in without a pass!

02:45.729 --> 02:47.169
Is this the right place?

02:48.129 --> 02:50.800
It's a praetorian sacrifice.

02:51.729 --> 02:55.520
The quadrants match.
Kwaini demons love muscle and mirrors.

02:57.129 --> 02:59.759
I'm not fooling around.
I'll call the--

03:02.530 --> 03:04.919
No reflection.
I'll fix that.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.580
Stop that.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.530
- He has horns.
- Steroids. Bad for you.

04:45.050 --> 04:46.939
I think it was a sloth demon.

04:48.050 --> 04:52.370
Sloth demons don't sacrifice
adolescents. You I.D.'d a Carnyss.

04:52.850 --> 04:56.040
- Not the one last night.
- It's a nice gym.

04:57.649 --> 05:00.420
One burned a month ago.
Wolfram and Hart...

05:01.250 --> 05:03.350
...raised it when Angel
fought Vocah.

05:03.649 --> 05:07.199
At a gym, people encourage you
to work out.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.600
You don't have to.
You're eternal.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.550
May not always be.

05:14.449 --> 05:18.170
The Vartite Monster:
Took two days to kill that thing.

05:18.649 --> 05:20.370
It's very Wolfram and Hart.

05:21.050 --> 05:24.379
Steam, sauna, fresh towels.
How bad can it be?

05:25.250 --> 05:27.990
- You shower with lots of men.
- I'll always be a loner.

05:30.649 --> 05:31.839
Vision!

05:34.250 --> 05:35.329
Just a sneeze.

05:36.050 --> 05:37.629
- Oh.
- Oh?!

05:39.050 --> 05:42.420
Bless you. Sorry about this.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.300
Why not work at Wes'?

05:45.050 --> 05:47.220
We'll get a new office.
I haven't--

05:48.649 --> 05:49.839
Sneeze...

05:52.850 --> 05:54.079
...followed by vision.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.509
You all right?

06:04.529 --> 06:05.610
I'll survive.

06:05.730 --> 06:06.529
What is it?

06:06.930 --> 06:09.100
A nasty demon.
Didn't recognize it.

06:09.930 --> 06:13.089
Nasty...demon...unknown...origin.

06:14.730 --> 06:16.170
Awful lot of that here.

06:16.529 --> 06:18.279
He'll feel right at home.

06:19.970 --> 06:21.439
You can review the contract...

06:21.769 --> 06:23.839
...you should. We'll talk Monday.

06:24.170 --> 06:27.540
Sign, or we'll sue your ass
and kill your kids.

06:28.370 --> 06:30.899
Just kidding.
Nobody wants a lawsuit.

06:36.170 --> 06:38.100
It's nice and gloomy in here.

06:45.170 --> 06:48.290
You're not handicapped,
you're handi-capable.

06:49.370 --> 06:53.689
She likes Chopin and Brahms.
She's not fond of the Russians.

07:01.370 --> 07:02.420
Hello, Darla.

07:03.170 --> 07:05.589
How are you?
Feeling any better?

07:06.769 --> 07:08.310
- It's a beautiful day outside--
- Shut up.

07:09.170 --> 07:13.209
She's not a child.
She's 400 years old.

07:21.170 --> 07:22.220
The prelude.

07:24.170 --> 07:28.240
In C minor.
The preludes and the nocturnes.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.970
Much better than the waltzes.

07:33.170 --> 07:37.490
- He had consumption.
- Died too soon. Lot of that around.

07:40.970 --> 07:42.050
He's here.

07:42.769 --> 07:47.019
- Chopin?
- Angel. He's here in town.

07:48.170 --> 07:51.399
- You can feel him.
- Always could.

07:53.569 --> 07:55.040
He hasn't helped us.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.220
He killed me.

08:03.170 --> 08:07.420
I remember now.
With a soul in his heart.

08:08.569 --> 08:12.819
He's taken from both of us.
So when you feel ready...

08:13.970 --> 08:15.689
...we'll give some back.

08:18.170 --> 08:21.750
Angel. Been a long time.

08:25.970 --> 08:28.069
I'd love to see that boy.

08:30.170 --> 08:31.920
Eyes are farther apart.

08:33.769 --> 08:37.419
They look through you.
This guy's not afraid of much.

08:37.970 --> 08:40.429
I say Northern Pakistan, Hindu Kush.

08:41.570 --> 08:45.820
Or the Tien Shenin in Kazakhstan.
I need Suleman's Compendium.

08:47.570 --> 08:50.409
- Don't yell. You'll scare him.
- Scare him?

08:50.570 --> 08:52.639
Dennis is sensitive. He wants to help.

08:52.970 --> 08:56.090
He's more a person than a G-H-O-S-T.

08:58.970 --> 09:00.129
We need an office.

09:03.169 --> 09:04.289
There! There!

09:05.570 --> 09:07.779
Prio Motu demon. It's a killer.

09:09.769 --> 09:12.509
"Ancient Ofga-beast,
bred to maim and massacre."

09:13.370 --> 09:14.879
Goody. A pit bull.

09:15.169 --> 09:17.980
Now we know what we're dealing with.

09:19.370 --> 09:20.600
A Prio Motu.

09:20.570 --> 09:24.289
We need to find it.
It's narrowed down to "somewhere."

09:25.370 --> 09:26.070
I can help.

09:26.570 --> 09:30.259
I've broadened our contacts
to include the underlife.

09:30.769 --> 09:32.029
I know who can help.

09:32.570 --> 09:34.639
- Who?
- Parasite named Merl.

09:34.970 --> 09:37.070
We'll pay the stoolie a visit.

09:37.970 --> 09:40.809
Make with the chin music
till he canaries.

09:42.769 --> 09:44.940
I watched a noir festival on Bravo.

09:45.769 --> 09:48.230
He goes to a safe haven for demons.

09:48.769 --> 09:51.820
I meant to take you. It may be of use.

09:54.169 --> 09:56.799
- But....
- But what?

09:58.970 --> 10:00.929
It's a bit outside the box.

10:01.850 --> 10:03.039
I'm so excited

10:03.649 --> 10:05.120
And I just can't hide it

10:12.649 --> 10:15.460
Tonight's the night
We're gonna make it happen

10:19.850 --> 10:23.399
Open your jacket.
All right, step back through.

10:40.250 --> 10:42.669
I just can't get enough
And if you move

10:47.450 --> 10:48.820
I'm so excited

10:49.250 --> 10:52.159
Your stool pigeon feels safe
in a karaoke bar?

10:52.850 --> 10:55.169
In this one. It's a sanctuary.

10:57.049 --> 10:59.049
Oh, yeah
I'm so excited

11:03.649 --> 11:07.860
I know I know I know
I know I want you, I want you

11:12.049 --> 11:13.909
Move over, Pointer Sisters!

11:15.649 --> 11:17.610
I'm losing control, and I like it.

11:18.049 --> 11:21.169
I'm gonna go talk to Liz.
Don't go anywhere.

11:21.649 --> 11:25.409
Next, Mordar the Bentback
does a personal favorite.

11:26.450 --> 11:27.960
Make him welcome.

11:34.850 --> 11:36.809
I see someone feels zippy.

11:37.250 --> 11:41.320
It's hatching time, but
life's more than eating your young.

11:42.649 --> 11:44.509
Here's what I see in your aura.

11:50.450 --> 11:51.639
Hello, Merl.

11:53.450 --> 11:56.289
- Cat got your tongue?
- I have no tongue.

11:57.049 --> 11:57.820
Oh.

11:59.450 --> 12:02.289
- Keep the sucker away.
- Can't hurt you here.

12:03.049 --> 12:06.240
Hates his own kind,
beats on the demons he finds.

12:06.649 --> 12:08.090
If they waste my time.

12:13.850 --> 12:15.429
Looking for a Prio Motu.

12:15.649 --> 12:16.519
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:16.850 --> 12:18.809
You've never seen one up close.

12:19.850 --> 12:23.990
Prios are stone-cold killers.
They got teeth that'll....

12:25.250 --> 12:28.759
Sweeten this a whole lot.
And keep my name out.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.639
Prios don't like it above ground.

12:37.250 --> 12:40.730
He'll be in one of those
sub-tunnels off Redondo.

12:42.649 --> 12:45.490
They're nasty.
Not a mosquito like you...

12:46.250 --> 12:49.159
...turns to dust if you stake it.
Good luck.

12:52.250 --> 12:54.879
Love the coat.
It's all about the coat.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.299
Welcome to Caritas.

12:57.049 --> 12:59.330
- Meaning?
- Latin for "mercy."

12:59.450 --> 13:02.049
Smart and cute.
How about a number?

13:03.649 --> 13:04.809
I don't sing.

13:05.450 --> 13:07.590
Neither does Mordar.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.909
He's a foghorn on two legs.

13:11.450 --> 13:14.779
- Who is this guy?
- He's anagogic.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.279
He looks like he eats enough.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.990
Psychic.
He's connected to the mystic.

13:22.850 --> 13:26.470
When you sing, you bare your soul.
He sees into it.

13:27.049 --> 13:31.230
This is about your spirit.
I can't read you unless you sing.

13:31.850 --> 13:33.250
- I don't sing.
- Come on, Angel.

13:33.649 --> 13:35.330
- I want to hear you sing.
- No.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.509
- It's a good cause.
- Who's the boss?

13:39.049 --> 13:43.370
You feel smooth, in the groove.
Doesn't that come before a fall?

13:47.450 --> 13:51.629
Three things I don't do:
tan, date and sing in public.

13:54.649 --> 13:55.700
See you around.

13:56.450 --> 13:58.659
I'd look fabulous in that coat.

14:22.850 --> 14:26.399
It's okay. I won't hurt you.
Are you all right?

14:28.250 --> 14:29.690
Look out!

15:02.450 --> 15:05.120
It's all right. He'd dead.

15:06.049 --> 15:08.580
What did you do? Oh, my God.

15:13.850 --> 15:18.169
What have you done?
What have you done?

15:28.090 --> 15:29.950
I thought he would hurt you.

15:30.490 --> 15:31.720
He was my protector.

15:34.090 --> 15:35.139
Stay away.

15:35.889 --> 15:39.440
I'm sorry. I was sent to--
I'm not exactly sure, but--

15:40.090 --> 15:42.090
- Sent here?
- By The Powers That--

15:42.490 --> 15:45.539
It's a long story.
I help people.

15:46.090 --> 15:49.070
You're joking, right?
I hate this town.

15:49.690 --> 15:51.200
What did he protect you from?

15:52.090 --> 15:53.629
- Things you can't handle.
- Like what?

15:53.889 --> 15:58.309
Like the Tribunal! I don't know you
or what your deal is...

15:59.289 --> 16:01.820
...and I don't care.
He protected me.

16:02.289 --> 16:06.429
I had one friend and you killed him.
Stay away from me.

16:11.889 --> 16:13.120
He was good?

16:16.690 --> 16:17.559
Yeah.

16:21.490 --> 16:22.679
And you....

16:26.289 --> 16:27.200
Yeah.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.500
That's bad.

16:33.490 --> 16:36.440
Which, of course, you already--
Right.

16:37.090 --> 16:39.929
Look, he was a demon.
I just assumed....

16:40.690 --> 16:44.480
Why wouldn't you?
Cordelia said he was a nasty demon.

16:45.490 --> 16:48.610
He looked nasty.
I didn't say he killed, you did.

16:49.090 --> 16:52.389
That's what Prio Motus are.
They hunt, kill.

16:54.490 --> 16:58.809
We're to think a creature
can change its M.O. overnight?

16:59.889 --> 17:03.509
Turn into some noble protector
and defender of....

17:07.089 --> 17:08.390
Oh, God.

17:08.890 --> 17:13.210
I felt no fear when I saw him.
Angel should have helped him....

17:15.490 --> 17:18.789
Thanks for the obscure visions.
We're doing great.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.339
I killed an innocent.
He's a soldier, like me.

17:24.490 --> 17:26.348
His mission is mine now.

17:26.890 --> 17:29.940
It's a start.
He protected a pregnant woman.

17:31.089 --> 17:34.319
- Find out what the Tribunal is.
- We will.

17:36.490 --> 17:37.569
You didn't know.

17:38.289 --> 17:39.970
But somebody did.

17:40.609 --> 17:43.450
You're not on protected ground.
The truth.

17:44.210 --> 17:46.460
- I told you where.
- I'm out of time.

17:47.210 --> 17:49.140
- Why'd you lie?
- The price on the woman.

17:49.609 --> 17:51.539
- Woman or the baby?
- The kid.

17:52.009 --> 17:56.329
She'll be powerful. The Dark Ones
want her and her mom dead.

17:57.410 --> 18:01.519
Local brokers offer hard cash,
but that Prio was around.

18:02.809 --> 18:05.789
- Now that he's gone, we--
- Where is she?

18:06.410 --> 18:09.500
If I knew, would I be
getting strangled?

18:10.009 --> 18:11.380
Nobody touches her.

18:11.809 --> 18:14.480
Too late.
You know how many are after her?

18:15.410 --> 18:17.339
- Where'd he live?
- Don't know...

18:17.809 --> 18:20.829
...Boyle Heights, underground,
by the DWP.

18:22.009 --> 18:23.970
An iffy part of town.

18:32.809 --> 18:34.390
Just take the car!

18:36.410 --> 18:37.460
Look out!

18:56.809 --> 18:58.490
You should go home now.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.920
You're welcome!

19:05.210 --> 19:08.930
People nowadays.
Would it hurt to say thank you?

19:10.009 --> 19:10.880
Angel.

19:11.809 --> 19:13.420
Been a while. You well?

19:14.210 --> 19:17.259
Picture of health.
You haven't aged a bit.

19:19.609 --> 19:21.930
- Got a situation.
- No small talk.

19:22.609 --> 19:25.910
Go up to Broadway.
See you at the crib.

19:27.410 --> 19:30.109
- Where's home?
- Nice landlord off 8th.

19:30.410 --> 19:33.890
We keep the area safe, he cuts
the rent. What's up?

19:34.609 --> 19:37.940
- Heard of a Prio Motu?
- Is it like a '62 Chevy?

19:39.410 --> 19:40.670
I'll just say no.

19:41.210 --> 19:43.000
A warrior demon.

19:43.609 --> 19:47.750
I thought it was just roaches and
vampires. What's he do?

19:48.410 --> 19:51.960
He's dead. He lived
underground by the DWP.

19:52.609 --> 19:55.309
I know the area.
You want to do it now?

19:56.210 --> 19:57.190
It's urgent.

19:57.410 --> 19:59.829
- How deep are these?
- Pretty deep.

20:00.410 --> 20:03.990
We killed vampires here last year.
Now we check it.

20:05.210 --> 20:07.839
- And the Prio "Mojo"?
- Protected a woman.

20:08.210 --> 20:09.440
- He was good?
- Yeah.

20:10.009 --> 20:13.380
- What scumbag killed him?
- I'm the scumbag.

20:13.609 --> 20:14.450
Oh.

20:14.809 --> 20:17.299
Hold up. That wasn't there before.

20:23.809 --> 20:27.849
You feel any air coming out?
I don't feel air.

20:41.809 --> 20:43.529
Guy kept a neat house.

21:10.009 --> 21:12.039
- "Kamal."
- What's that?

21:16.009 --> 21:17.269
It was his name.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.539
Looking for something?

21:42.410 --> 21:45.569
- Like that?
- I hate to ask, but--

21:46.609 --> 21:50.440
- What you need?
- I work with these people.

21:52.609 --> 21:55.869
He must see this.
Say it's about the Tribunal.

21:56.809 --> 22:00.529
The Tribunal.
You gonna stay and soak up the guilt?

22:01.009 --> 22:02.549
Something like that.

23:11.210 --> 23:14.720
You're safe.
That's good.

23:16.009 --> 23:18.680
You shouldn't be here.
You've no right.

23:19.009 --> 23:23.329
I know. It's not my choice.
Kamal's mission is mine now.

23:24.410 --> 23:27.430
You sound just like him,
with your missions...

23:28.609 --> 23:31.869
...ancient laws, medieval honor.
I don't care.

23:32.210 --> 23:33.859
I want to protect my baby.

23:34.609 --> 23:37.869
- I understand.
- How could you? I don't!

23:38.809 --> 23:42.319
Six months ago I worked
the register at Costco.

23:43.009 --> 23:45.609
I began as a stock girl and I moved up.

23:46.609 --> 23:50.720
I could provide for my baby.
Now I just hope she's born.

23:52.009 --> 23:53.059
I want it too.

23:53.210 --> 23:56.759
Right.
Because she's a seer or Joan of Arc.

23:58.009 --> 24:02.049
Well, you know what she is to me?
My daughter.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.529
Not a holy mission.

24:06.410 --> 24:10.339
Oh, no, it's not exactly that.
It's sort of my job.

24:12.410 --> 24:15.920
- Your job?
- Yeah. Look, I got cards.

24:17.210 --> 24:18.369
And an office.

24:19.009 --> 24:22.660
It blew up, but we have
an apartment in Silverlake.

24:26.210 --> 24:30.210
Let me help you.
Let me help your daughter.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.900
We need the coat of arms.

24:40.609 --> 24:43.349
Kamal said to give it to the Tribunal.

24:43.609 --> 24:47.049
Maybe if I do, they'll call it--
What?

24:49.609 --> 24:52.910
Is it a round bronze talisman,
about this big?

24:53.809 --> 24:56.509
- Yes.
- Yeah. I already found it.

24:58.009 --> 24:59.940
Yeah? Where is it?

25:02.210 --> 25:03.150
What?

25:04.009 --> 25:07.059
I don't have it right here
on my person.

25:07.609 --> 25:10.660
I know where it is.
I can take you there.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.140
The address on the card--

25:13.609 --> 25:16.519
Do me a favor. Stop helping.

25:27.650 --> 25:28.589
Get back!

25:29.450 --> 25:32.009
- I can kill this. Right?
- Yes!

25:32.450 --> 25:35.470
Sure? You don't think he
might be good?

25:36.049 --> 25:37.059
Kill it!

25:45.650 --> 25:48.809
All right, I think we should run.

25:54.049 --> 25:55.980
- Who is it?
- Gunn.

25:57.049 --> 25:59.369
- What was that?
- Something about a gun.

25:59.450 --> 26:02.640
What if it's a demon with a gun?

26:03.650 --> 26:07.650
Listen, whoever you are. We're armed
and we know how to do battle.

26:08.450 --> 26:12.420
- If you know what's good for you--
- My name's Gunn. Angel sent me.

26:20.450 --> 26:25.019
This is a little embarrassing.
Please, come in. Come in.

26:25.849 --> 26:28.759
Wesley, you've heard Angel
talk about Gunn.

26:29.450 --> 26:32.329
He's a great guy
with a really fly street tag.

26:33.049 --> 26:36.980
- What's he fly?
- It's his street name, dorko.

26:37.849 --> 26:40.480
It really lets them know
you mean business.

26:40.849 --> 26:45.420
- It's my name. Charles Gunn. Two N's.
- Oh, Lord, will no one shut me up?

26:46.250 --> 26:50.819
I'm Wesley Wyndam-Pryce,
and this is Cordelia Chase.

26:52.250 --> 26:55.299
- It's nice to finally meet.
- I've seen you before.

26:55.849 --> 26:58.759
- The Tan 'n' Screen commercials.
- I saw you in bed.

26:59.450 --> 27:01.769
- What?!
- This is none of my business.

27:02.450 --> 27:04.269
- You too.
- Now, just a moment--

27:04.250 --> 27:06.740
In the hospital,
after the building blew.

27:07.849 --> 27:09.710
He sent me to look after you.

27:09.650 --> 27:11.509
- Right.
- I'm messing with you.

27:12.049 --> 27:16.259
I hoped to fight demons, but I
wound up with a delivery job instead.

27:19.250 --> 27:22.019
It may have something
to do with the Tribunal.

27:22.250 --> 27:25.869
This could be an emblem
or some sort of protective amulet.

27:27.049 --> 27:29.119
These all your cases?

27:29.450 --> 27:33.730
- Isn't this the well-oiled machine?
- We set them up, we knock them down.

27:34.250 --> 27:37.339
Well, we did, until Angel
knocked down the wrong--

27:38.450 --> 27:40.380
I'm sure he's on top of it now.

27:42.650 --> 27:43.809
What?

27:45.049 --> 27:46.420
This way.

27:52.250 --> 27:54.809
- Where are we?
- Come on.

28:13.849 --> 28:16.099
You've been here before.

28:20.450 --> 28:22.309
It feels creepy.

28:24.049 --> 28:24.920
Yeah.

28:26.450 --> 28:27.920
What's the Tribunal?

28:28.250 --> 28:32.359
Some other-worldly court. Supposedly,
they can save me and my baby.

28:33.049 --> 28:35.190
You go before them with the charm....

28:36.049 --> 28:39.559
I don't know how it works.
Kamal said he'd be my champion.

28:40.250 --> 28:42.779
Screw this. I'm getting out of town.

28:43.250 --> 28:46.230
- Try and stop me.
- They'll find you. Stay with me.

28:46.849 --> 28:48.500
- You can't protect me.
- I can.

28:48.650 --> 28:52.930
We'll get the charm and I'll make
this right. There's a gate in back--

28:54.049 --> 28:56.259
Go to the address I gave you. Go!

29:05.769 --> 29:08.819
- Are you all right? What happened?
- Is she here?

29:09.970 --> 29:12.500
The pregnant woman? No.

29:13.569 --> 29:16.829
- Gunn brought us the talisman, but--
- Working on it.

29:20.170 --> 29:22.339
I told her to come here.

29:23.170 --> 29:24.779
She doesn't trust me.

29:26.170 --> 29:27.329
Why should she?

29:31.569 --> 29:35.500
You can't see everything. You're
just a vampire like everyone else--

29:35.769 --> 29:39.559
- That didn't come out right.
- I thought I was out of the tunnel.

29:42.970 --> 29:44.019
Sure, you did.

29:45.970 --> 29:49.799
Because the tunnel is, you know,
it's something we all--

29:50.170 --> 29:52.869
Are we talking
a real tunnel or symbolic?

29:53.769 --> 29:57.140
I saw the light
at the end of the tunnel...

29:57.970 --> 30:00.569
...that, some day,
I might become human.

30:06.970 --> 30:09.000
That light was so bright...

30:09.970 --> 30:11.930
...I thought I was already out.

30:14.769 --> 30:18.210
Yeah, we all got
a little cocky, didn't we?

30:20.769 --> 30:24.390
It's gonna be a long while
till you work your way out.

30:25.569 --> 30:28.170
But I know you well enough
to know you will.

30:30.970 --> 30:33.359
And I'll be with you until you do.

30:37.569 --> 30:41.569
- And your inevitable stardom?
- I didn't say I won't have a day job.

30:44.769 --> 30:46.769
We've got something. It's medieval.

30:47.170 --> 30:51.740
A small badge or coat of arms to be
presented when going before the:

30:53.769 --> 30:56.819
- Translated, the Chair of Judgement.
- The Tribunal.

30:57.369 --> 30:59.299
A court to settle grievances.

30:59.769 --> 31:03.390
- With lawyers and stuff?
- This is a little more primitive.

31:03.970 --> 31:06.109
- It's a fight to the death.
- Kamal....

31:06.369 --> 31:08.970
- Where would it be?
- There's no way to tell.

31:09.970 --> 31:12.670
They could rise up
in our reality whenever.

31:12.970 --> 31:15.880
We gotta find her right away,
whatever it takes.

31:17.769 --> 31:19.140
There's only one way.

31:19.529 --> 31:24.759
You came and you gave
Without taking

31:26.130 --> 31:29.359
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy

31:38.130 --> 31:39.599
Oh, Mandy

31:41.730 --> 31:44.819
That man will do anything
to save a life.

31:50.730 --> 31:53.119
Stop me from shaking

31:53.730 --> 31:57.420
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy

32:00.930 --> 32:02.720
How about that? A performer.

32:03.329 --> 32:06.490
Let's just call him
"Angel, the vampire with soul."

32:08.730 --> 32:11.009
While I chat with
"Tall, dark and rocking"...

32:11.130 --> 32:13.589
...Durthock the Child-eater
will open up.

32:14.130 --> 32:16.089
A Gorrishyn Mage stole his power...

32:16.529 --> 32:20.289
...so he's feeling a little bit
country. Let's give him a hand.

32:23.130 --> 32:24.990
You're just the hot ticket.

32:25.529 --> 32:29.079
One night only, two seats left,
partially obstructed view.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.980
- So tell me.
- You're all business.

32:32.730 --> 32:33.920
She's in danger.

32:34.529 --> 32:37.549
You're feeling guilty.
You made an honest mistake.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.589
A lot of guys
would have done the same.

32:41.130 --> 32:43.940
Of course, now she has no champion.

32:44.130 --> 32:47.079
- That's looking grim for her.
- Where are they?

32:47.730 --> 32:52.119
Who's a little curt? Who's a little
Curt Jürgens in The Enemy Below?

32:53.130 --> 32:55.410
The Tribunal will be wherever she is.

32:56.130 --> 32:58.799
- And where is she?
- My question first.

32:59.130 --> 33:03.130
And answer true, because you know
I'll know. Why "Mandy"?

33:06.930 --> 33:09.000
Well, I know the words.

33:12.930 --> 33:16.089
- I kind of think it's pretty.
- It is, you big sap.

33:17.130 --> 33:20.849
There's not a destroyer of worlds
can argue with Manilow.

33:21.329 --> 33:24.769
- The trial's at 4th and Spring.
- How does it work?

33:25.529 --> 33:29.109
I can only tell you what I tell you.
The rest is up to you.

33:31.529 --> 33:34.690
- Can I save her?
- Try, and find out.

34:30.929 --> 34:34.300
- Where is your champion?
- He's dead.

34:34.530 --> 34:38.039
- You have no talisman or champion?
- I ask for asylum.

34:38.730 --> 34:42.489
Asylum is not ours to give.
Two are chosen to meet in combat.

34:43.530 --> 34:47.809
One can save your life, one can
take it. This is the ancient law.

34:48.329 --> 34:51.449
Your life is forfeit.
You have no champion.

34:55.530 --> 34:57.280
Yes, she does.

35:06.090 --> 35:08.480
The trial by combat will begin.

35:13.889 --> 35:16.980
I really appreciate you
coming through for us.

35:17.489 --> 35:21.739
But you know how you're not really
good at anything? Can you do this?

35:22.289 --> 35:26.500
- I grew up around horses.
- How long since you've ridden one?

35:27.690 --> 35:31.659
It's been a while. Don't worry,
it's not something you forget.

35:32.489 --> 35:33.889
I can do this.

35:35.489 --> 35:39.320
Nice horse. Try not to make me
look stupid out there, okay?

35:39.690 --> 35:40.849
All right.

36:07.289 --> 36:09.429
I guess that means go.

37:44.489 --> 37:48.739
The champion is defeated.
She and all her issue are yours.

37:54.090 --> 37:55.980
I move to appeal that ruling.

38:04.889 --> 38:07.170
- She's safe now, right?
- You have won.

38:07.889 --> 38:12.099
She's under our protection, as is
her daughter until she comes of age.

38:20.489 --> 38:22.099
Are you okay?

38:22.889 --> 38:24.079
Yeah.

38:25.889 --> 38:30.210
- You sure seem to bleed a lot.
- It's part of the job.

38:38.090 --> 38:40.090
Start over with a fresh slate.

38:40.489 --> 38:42.739
We're starting over with no slate.

38:44.090 --> 38:47.420
Of course.
We shouldn't be keeping score.

38:47.690 --> 38:52.039
We're not running a race.
We're doing a job, one soul at a time.

38:56.090 --> 38:59.349
You guys hold the fort.
I have somewhere to be.

39:00.289 --> 39:02.710
Close off the yard,
Cellblocks A to C,

39:08.690 --> 39:09.559
Hey.

39:11.690 --> 39:12.559
Hey.

39:14.690 --> 39:17.079
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, I guess.

39:17.690 --> 39:19.230
I did sign up for this.

39:20.090 --> 39:21.769
Regretting the choice?

39:22.489 --> 39:26.699
Bad day. A girl tried to build
her rep by throwing down with me.

39:27.289 --> 39:31.010
She had low self-esteem
and a homemade knife, so....

39:33.289 --> 39:34.199
Is she...

39:35.690 --> 39:36.769
...you know...

39:37.489 --> 39:38.650
...alive?

39:39.889 --> 39:42.980
She lives to tell the tale.
I took the knife away.

39:43.489 --> 39:45.519
I can't say much for her wrist.

39:46.489 --> 39:49.510
- So you didn't kill her.
- I really wanted to.

39:50.090 --> 39:52.510
Took a good beating
from the guards too.

39:54.889 --> 39:57.630
- I'm sorry.
- I've earned worse.

39:57.889 --> 39:59.889
Guys like us got it coming.

40:02.690 --> 40:06.309
- I had to sing Barry Manilow.
- You're kidding.

40:06.889 --> 40:08.429
In front of people.

40:08.690 --> 40:10.969
And here I talk
about my petty problems.

40:11.690 --> 40:15.380
- Wanted to give you some perspective.
- "Copacabana"?

40:15.889 --> 40:18.280
"Mandy." I don't want to dwell on it.

40:20.690 --> 40:23.010
The road to redemption
is a rocky path.

40:24.289 --> 40:25.480
That it is.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.230
Think we might make it?

40:30.289 --> 40:31.619
We might.

40:38.090 --> 40:41.780
- Food getting any better?
- It's similar to what I grew up on.

40:42.889 --> 40:46.369
It's a little one-note,
eating the same thing every day.

40:47.690 --> 40:49.369
I wonder what that's like.

41:06.250 --> 41:08.250
I remember all my life

41:08.650 --> 41:11.630
How you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking

41:12.250 --> 41:13.650
Mandy, um....

41:15.250 --> 41:17.739
look in their eyes

41:18.250 --> 41:21.199
I see them in--

41:22.449 --> 41:24.699
How you kissed me
And stopped me

41:25.449 --> 41:28.329
It's shaking.
Freaks in the house, up front.

41:29.050 --> 41:29.989
Oh, Mandy

41:30.250 --> 41:32.280
Why are you in my living room?

41:33.250 --> 41:34.510
Oh, Mandy

41:37.449 --> 41:38.360
Thank you,

41:39.305 --> 41:45.680
