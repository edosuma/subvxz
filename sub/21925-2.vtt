WEBVTT

00:54.971 --> 00:57.265
7 YEARS EARLIER

05:41.758 --> 05:44.553
Where is T'Kuvma?

05:45.470 --> 05:49.390
I heed the sacred call
of the Beacon of Kahless,

05:49.474 --> 05:53.227
and the one who sent it
ignores my presence?

05:53.561 --> 05:57.106
Your leader delays me from my voyage. Why?

05:57.607 --> 06:01.194
What threat to the Empire
spreads across the stars?

06:01.904 --> 06:04.448
Bring your leader at once.

06:04.907 --> 06:08.118
Do not waste any more of my time.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.578
"My presence."

06:10.870 --> 06:12.205
"My voyage."

06:13.290 --> 06:14.625
"My time."

06:14.707 --> 06:19.754
No one speaks of "my duty" or "my honor."

06:20.422 --> 06:22.132
Show respect, T'Kuvma.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.259
You are nothing.

06:24.342 --> 06:29.013
You have not earned a seat
on this council.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.684
And yet I am the one who leads the way
to our Empire's resurrection.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.522
As a child,

06:37.605 --> 06:42.318
my destiny was illuminated
by the light of Kahless.

06:43.487 --> 06:47.324
This ship belonged to my father.

06:47.699 --> 06:52.079
Upon his death, it lay abandoned until...

06:53.956 --> 06:55.791
I discovered it...

06:56.250 --> 07:00.838
and vowed to restore honor to my house.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.135
This is not your playground.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.639
You will show my house respect!

07:19.189 --> 07:22.401
But there is no honor without unity.

07:23.025 --> 07:28.573
There is no home for any of us,
unless it is shared by all.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.785
You speak of unity,

07:31.869 --> 07:36.456
yet you disgrace this ship

07:36.539 --> 07:39.167
with outcasts and vermin.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.253
Look around!

07:41.336 --> 07:43.881
This holy vessel soars once again
because of my lord.

07:44.589 --> 07:48.926
He has even devised a way to hide it
behind a cloak of invisibility.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.847
My house is open to all.

07:54.807 --> 08:00.146
Including those discarded by you, Kol.

08:00.229 --> 08:03.900
But my house is bonded
by a single doctrine:

08:04.192 --> 08:06.527
Remain Klingon.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.322
We are done listening to this fool.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.909
The House of D'Ghor will hear more.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.286
As will House Mokai.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.417
One day soon,

08:21.210 --> 08:24.922
I will put you back in your place,
T'Kuvma.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.718
How do you propose to unite us?

08:30.635 --> 08:34.889
We have become complacent in the time

08:34.972 --> 08:39.810
since we last battled the Federation
at Donatu V.

08:40.604 --> 08:43.857
Our purity is a threat to them.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.069
They wish to drag us into the muck,

08:48.152 --> 08:53.407
where humans, Vulcans, Tellarites,

08:53.492 --> 08:56.662
and filthy Andorians mix.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.039
Their ship is but a fleck.

08:59.830 --> 09:03.876
What threat does one ship pose?

09:04.168 --> 09:08.339
Great leaders,
everything I say will come to pass.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.841
Look to the stars.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.388
Our destiny has arrived!

10:19.327 --> 10:22.371
Here it comes. Their lie.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.460
No!

10:26.543 --> 10:27.836
They do not!

10:27.920 --> 10:32.799
They come to destroy our individuality.

10:32.882 --> 10:36.218
Shall we rise up together...

10:36.553 --> 10:39.097
and give them the fight they deserve?

10:39.431 --> 10:41.642
Remain Klingon!

10:44.019 --> 10:44.895
Fire!

19:52.065 --> 19:54.526
Do you wish to respond, my lord?

19:56.864 --> 19:58.073
Begin transmission.

20:32.316 --> 20:34.610
Lest anyone doubt

20:34.693 --> 20:37.529
that I can render my own vessels

20:37.613 --> 20:39.448
invisible.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.015
We have suffered losses...

22:32.019 --> 22:37.232
but the Federation has suffered far more.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.275
Leaders, return to Qo'noS.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.822
Declare far and wide

22:43.906 --> 22:46.116
that the Klingon race

22:46.198 --> 22:50.035
fights as a united Empire once again.

22:50.660 --> 22:54.206
Open your hearts to the one
who delivered this great day.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.002
Follow the light.

22:58.003 --> 22:59.880
Follow T'Kuvma.

23:01.965 --> 23:05.761
T'Kuvma the Unforgettable!

23:06.428 --> 23:10.390
T'Kuvma the Unforgettable!

23:11.058 --> 23:14.603
T'Kuvma the Unforgettable!

25:54.346 --> 25:56.765
The Federation ships are hiding...

25:57.224 --> 25:59.852
or scattered in pieces.

26:00.394 --> 26:02.271
They pose no threat.

26:02.354 --> 26:04.857
Then the fight is won.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.147
Yes.

26:24.793 --> 26:27.713
And our dead?

26:28.336 --> 26:29.838
They float...

26:30.797 --> 26:35.552
untethered on the battlefield,
soon to be lost.

26:35.929 --> 26:38.348
Task everyone with retrieving them.

26:38.638 --> 26:41.850
I will prepare each of the slain
for entombment...

26:42.436 --> 26:44.855
with my own hands.

30:11.061 --> 30:14.690
A warrior who dies in his sleep...

30:17.526 --> 30:18.861
is no more...

30:20.487 --> 30:24.074
than flesh and bone.

30:30.163 --> 30:32.291
A warrior who perishes

30:33.584 --> 30:35.460
honorably in battle

30:35.544 --> 30:36.795
is blessed.

30:39.045 --> 30:42.215
A hero's demise brings pride for a life...

30:43.635 --> 30:47.639
given in defense of our race...

30:48.599 --> 30:50.601
and comfort in the knowledge

30:50.807 --> 30:54.143
that new life awaits in Sto-Vo-Kor.

31:06.447 --> 31:11.327
Join your vaunted comrades,

31:11.872 --> 31:14.708
brothers and sisters,

31:15.709 --> 31:17.711
for you are not alone

31:18.459 --> 31:24.007
and stand watch
among the Black Fleet forever.

34:22.852 --> 34:27.148
Your life will be remembered forever
by all Klingons.

34:28.274 --> 34:31.778
Your death will be a cause

34:31.864 --> 34:33.156
to unite us all.

34:37.286 --> 34:40.330
Do you hear that?

34:41.913 --> 34:43.539
No, my lord.

34:43.873 --> 34:48.252
The words we said as children

34:49.212 --> 34:51.547
in Kahless' honor.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.680
Whom do we seek?

34:58.015 --> 34:58.849
Kahless.

34:58.932 --> 35:01.310
How do we find him?

35:01.935 --> 35:03.604
Together.

35:03.976 --> 35:07.188
Give us light to see.

35:07.563 --> 35:08.648
Forever.

35:09.026 --> 35:14.948
Will he hide from us always?

35:18.410 --> 35:19.286
Never.
