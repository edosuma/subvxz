WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:06.033
- "SO THE LION GOT SOME CREAM
FOR HIS CHICKEN POX."

00:07.233 --> 00:08.867
- HOW MANY MORE
BEFORE MICHAEL?

00:08.867 --> 00:10.200
- SHH!

00:10.200 --> 00:12.033
- 40 MINUTES ALREADY.
- QUIET.

00:12.033 --> 00:14.933
- "AND HIS MOMMY
PUT THE CREAM ON,

00:14.933 --> 00:16.800
AND HE FELT BETTER."

00:16.800 --> 00:18.167
THE END.

00:18.167 --> 00:20.767
- THANK YOU, GRACIE.

00:20.767 --> 00:24.100
THAT WAS A WONDERFUL
AND VERY IMAGINATIVE STORY.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.600
AND NOW WE HAVE IAN.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.333
- OH, CRAP.

00:30.267 --> 00:32.800
- "ESCAPE FROM THE BLUE PLANET."

00:32.800 --> 00:36.300
- FINALLY, SCIENCE FICTION.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.567
- "THE ROCKET SHIP LANDED
ON THE BLUE PLANET

00:38.567 --> 00:41.300
THAT WAS FILLED
WITH WATER."

00:41.300 --> 00:42.733
- YOU DON'T THINK
THIS IS NICE?

00:42.733 --> 00:44.767
YOU KNOW, THEY WROTE THESE
ALL BY THEMSELVES.

00:44.767 --> 00:48.033
- NO KIDDING.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.633
- "AND THE ROCKET GOT STUCK,

00:49.633 --> 00:52.233
BUT THE PILOT
HAD SOME EXTRA GAS."

00:52.233 --> 00:54.033
- HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

00:56.067 --> 00:58.800
- "SO THAT IS HOW
THEY WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE

00:58.800 --> 01:00.567
FROM THE BLUE PLANET."

01:00.567 --> 01:02.633
THE END.

01:04.133 --> 01:07.000
- WONDERFUL, IAN,
AND VERY EXCITING.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.567
MICHAEL, IT'S YOUR TURN.

01:08.567 --> 01:10.100
- THANK GOD.

01:10.100 --> 01:12.100
WE GO AFTER THIS.

01:15.133 --> 01:18.200
- "THE ANGRY FAMILY."

01:32.033 --> 01:35.400
"THE DADDY WAS MAD
AT THE MOMMY."

01:41.100 --> 01:44.600
"THE MOMMY WAS MAD
AT THE DADDY."

01:44.600 --> 01:47.533
- [laughing]

01:48.967 --> 01:53.467
- "THE MOMMY AND DADDY
WERE VERY MAD AT THE GRANDPA.

01:58.667 --> 02:02.000
THE GRANDMA GOT MAD
AT EVERYBODY."

02:02.000 --> 02:04.267
- I DID NOT.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.067
IT'S WONDERFUL.

02:08.533 --> 02:12.433
- "THE GROWNUPS
WERE ALWAYS VERY LOUD.

02:12.433 --> 02:16.067
IT HURT THE KIDS' EARS."

02:16.067 --> 02:17.433
THE END.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.200
LET'S WATCH TV!
- YEAH!

02:38.200 --> 02:39.800
- YAY!
- LET'S WATCH TV!

02:39.800 --> 02:41.700
- WHOO!

02:55.000 --> 02:58.867
- WELL, I CAN'T GO THERE
ANYMORE.

02:58.867 --> 03:00.567
THE LOOKS I WAS GETTING--

03:00.567 --> 03:03.233
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN LOOKS
LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE.

03:03.233 --> 03:05.533
- YOU OUGHT TO WATCH ME MORE.

03:09.700 --> 03:13.100
- HOW COULD YOU LET MICHAEL
WRITE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

03:13.100 --> 03:14.767
- WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS.

03:14.767 --> 03:17.167
EILEEN LET THE KIDS WRITE
WHATEVER THEY WANTED.

03:17.167 --> 03:20.533
- WHO'S EILEEN?
- THE TEACHER.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.000
LOOK, I'M NOT THRILLED ABOUT
THIS EITHER, BUT, YOU KNOW,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.667
KIDS SHOULD BE ABLE TO
EXPRESS WHAT THEY'RE FEELING.

03:25.667 --> 03:28.767
- WHAT A LOAD OF BULL.

03:28.767 --> 03:31.467
HERE'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF YOUR LIBERAL,

03:31.467 --> 03:35.033
"FREE TO BE A BIRD OR BEE"
COLLEGE CLAPTRAP

03:35.033 --> 03:38.100
COMIN' HOME TO BITE
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY IN THE ASS.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.900
- OH?

03:44.900 --> 03:46.567
THE WHOLE FAMILY?

03:46.567 --> 03:49.300
THE WHOLE FAMILY?
WHAT AM I?

03:49.300 --> 03:51.367
I WASN'T EVEN MENTIONED
IN THAT BOOK.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.133
- WHAT, YOU'RE INSULTED
'CAUSE YOU WEREN'T INSULTED?

03:56.133 --> 03:58.867
- I'M INSULTED THAT YOU HAVE
BRAINWASHED YOUR CHILDREN

03:58.867 --> 04:01.033
INTO THINKING
THE ONLY THING I'M GOOD FOR

04:01.033 --> 04:03.633
IS TO HOLD UP A PIÃ‘ATA.

04:03.633 --> 04:05.400
- AND I DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT.
- WHAT?

04:05.400 --> 04:06.767
- THE KID'S ILLUSTRATIONS.

04:06.767 --> 04:08.733
PEOPLE ARE GONNA THINK
I LOOK LIKE THAT.

04:08.733 --> 04:10.400
- OKAY, EVERYONE,

04:10.400 --> 04:12.733
COULD WE ALL PLEASE
JUST GO HOME?

04:12.733 --> 04:14.733
- DEBRA'S RIGHT.
WE GOT TO TALK TO MICHAEL.

04:14.733 --> 04:17.100
- YOU GONNA PUNISH HIM?
I WANT INPUT.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.333
- ALL RIGHT,
COME ON, COME ON.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.633
- NOBODY'S PUNISHING ANYONE.

04:20.633 --> 04:21.967
- OF COURSE NOT.

04:21.967 --> 04:23.867
GOD FORBID SOMEONE'S
FEELINGS SHOULD GET HURT.

04:23.867 --> 04:25.967
- WELL, MY FEELINGS ARE HURT.
- MINE TOO!

04:25.967 --> 04:27.433
NOBODY CARES!

04:27.433 --> 04:29.567
- I'M WRITING MY OWN BOOK.
- GET OUT.

04:32.267 --> 04:34.167
- THAT'S THE TITLE.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.767
- MICHAEL.
- HEY, WHOA.

04:41.767 --> 04:43.533
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.233
MICHAEL, COULD YOU
COME IN HERE, PLEASE?

04:45.233 --> 04:46.900
- BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY.
- DON'T WORRY.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.100
- HE WRITES IT DOWN.

04:50.600 --> 04:54.833
- SWEETIE, I JUST WANT
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

04:54.833 --> 04:59.700
DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR FAMILY
IS "THE ANGRY FAMILY"?

04:59.700 --> 05:02.367
IT'S OKAY, HONEY,
YOU CAN TELL US.

05:03.833 --> 05:05.033
RAY, YOU WANT TO --
- NOPE.

05:05.033 --> 05:07.233
- [sighs]

05:07.233 --> 05:10.867
- I LOVED YOUR STORY, MICHAEL.

05:10.867 --> 05:12.700
SAID DADDY.

05:16.267 --> 05:19.467
- GO ON, WATCH TV.

05:19.467 --> 05:22.200
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
- WHAT?

05:22.200 --> 05:23.800
HEY, IF YOU WERE
ON TOP OF STUFF,

05:23.800 --> 05:26.200
YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED
THE STORY FROM LEAKIN' OUT.

05:27.433 --> 05:30.567
- I AM ON TOP OF STUFF!
WHAT DO YOU DO, HUH?

05:30.567 --> 05:33.500
LOOK, THOSE STORIES
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A SURPRISE

05:33.500 --> 05:34.533
FOR THE PARENTS.

05:34.533 --> 05:36.333
- A SURPRISE FOR THE PARENTS?

05:36.333 --> 05:37.800
I THINK A SURPRISE IS,

05:37.800 --> 05:39.733
YOU GET TO THE SCHOOL
AND THERE'S AN OPEN BAR.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.767
NO, THIS WAS LIKE AN AMBUSH.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.100
- AND YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE

05:51.100 --> 05:52.600
WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM
IS HERE, CAN YOU?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.833
THERE'S AN IMAGE
THAT MICHAEL HAS OF US.

05:54.833 --> 05:58.100
- COME ON, WE'RE NORMAL.

05:58.100 --> 06:01.200
COMPARATIVELY NORMAL.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.533
WATCH THE NEWS.

06:02.533 --> 06:03.800
- PLEASE.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.133
- ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY,

06:06.133 --> 06:08.933
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN YOU SEEM TO YELL

06:08.933 --> 06:11.800
FOR NO REASON, YOU KNOW?

06:11.800 --> 06:16.333
MAYBE...MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
HE'S PICKIN' UP ON.

06:16.333 --> 06:19.167
- I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
MOST OF THE LEADING CHARACTERS

06:19.167 --> 06:22.200
IN THAT STORY
WERE FROM THE BARONE SIDE.

06:22.200 --> 06:26.167
- YEAH, OKAY, BUT THE LOUD PART,
I'M THINKIN', IS PROBABLY YOU.

06:26.167 --> 06:28.167
- SO YOU'RE BLAMING ME?

06:28.167 --> 06:30.000
YOU'RE COMPLETELY FREE
AND CLEAR?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.567
- I'M SORRY,
BUT I AM NOT THE YELLER.

06:31.567 --> 06:33.300
- YOU ARE THE REASON
FOR THE YELLER!

06:33.300 --> 06:34.933
- WELL, YOU ASSUME
THAT THERE MUST BE YELLING!

06:34.933 --> 06:36.867
- YEAH, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
THERE'S YELL--

06:36.867 --> 06:39.133
- HEY, HEY, HEY!
- HEY!

06:39.133 --> 06:40.200
WHAT, HONEY?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.400
- CAN I HAVE A JUICE?

06:41.400 --> 06:42.667
- SURE, SWEETIE.
- YEAH, SURE.

06:42.667 --> 06:44.167
YEAH, WE CAN DO THAT,
RIGHT, MOMMY?

06:44.167 --> 06:46.633
- OH, THANK YOU, DADDY.

06:46.633 --> 06:48.267
THANK YOU.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.400
WE HAVE PROBLEMS.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.733
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT?

07:05.733 --> 07:06.967
- NO, IT IS NOT ALL RIGHT.

07:06.967 --> 07:08.267
THIS ARGUMENT JUST NOW

07:08.267 --> 07:09.800
IS EXACTLY WHAT MICHAEL
WAS REFERRING TO.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.833
- WELL, YOU DON'T GOT TO
WORRY ABOUT THIS ONE,

07:11.833 --> 07:13.000
BECAUSE THAT WAS GEOFFREY.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.467
[telephone rings]

07:14.467 --> 07:16.067
PHONE.

07:17.767 --> 07:19.133
HELLO?

07:19.133 --> 07:21.367
OH, HI, EILEEN.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.267
YEAH, HI.

07:25.267 --> 07:26.733
[clears throat]
HOW ARE YA?

07:26.733 --> 07:29.067
YEAH, OH, NO,
THAT WAS A GREAT OPEN HOUSE.

07:29.067 --> 07:32.033
YEAH.
DYNAMITE.

07:32.033 --> 07:33.100
WHAT CONFERENCE?

07:33.100 --> 07:34.500
- [gasps]

07:34.500 --> 07:37.600
- OH, OH, THAT'S THIS WEEK TOO.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.633
YEAH, RIGHT, WITH THE PARENTS.
UH-HUH.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.533
YEAH, I GUESS WE MUST'VE
FORGOT ABOUT IT.

07:41.533 --> 07:44.433
YEAH, IT WASN'T LIKE WE WERE
TRYING TO RUN OUT OR ANYTHING,

07:44.433 --> 07:47.667
YEAH, YEAH, NO, 'CAUSE,
UH, WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

07:47.667 --> 07:48.633
WE LOVE YOU.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.133
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

07:53.133 --> 07:54.767
YEAH, SURE,
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

07:54.767 --> 07:57.367
OKAY, BYE-BYE.

07:57.367 --> 07:58.200
[sighs]

07:58.200 --> 08:00.000
- [sighs]

08:00.000 --> 08:01.933
- LISTEN, ABOUT TOMORROW,
YOU KNOW.

08:01.933 --> 08:04.567
I GOT A PRETTY BIG DAY, SO--
- YOU DON'T WANT TO FINISH THAT.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.867
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

08:05.867 --> 08:09.200
- AND DID YOU HAVE TO SOUND
SO GUILTY ON THE PHONE?

08:09.200 --> 08:12.533
- HOW ABOUT YOU?
YOU RAN AWAY LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

08:19.933 --> 08:24.367
- OKAY.
SO HOW ARE YOU?

08:24.367 --> 08:27.467
- TERRIFIC.
[giggles]

08:27.467 --> 08:31.000
SO...THAT WAS SO,
SO FUNNY YESTERDAY.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.267
[giggles]

08:32.267 --> 08:34.567
- WHAT WAS?
- MICHAEL'S BOOK.

08:34.567 --> 08:35.600
"ANGRY FAMILY."

08:35.600 --> 08:38.000
[giggles]

08:38.000 --> 08:40.933
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE...
ANYWAY.

08:40.933 --> 08:42.267
UM, IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.

08:42.267 --> 08:44.067
HAPPY TO DISCUSS EVERYTHING.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.600
- I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED
WITH WHAT MICHAEL

08:45.600 --> 08:47.167
WROTE ABOUT IN HIS BOOK,
WEREN'T YOU?

08:47.167 --> 08:49.500
- ME? UH, DEFINITELY.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.267
OH, DEFINITELY.

08:51.267 --> 08:56.500
UM, BUT I DO THINK
THAT HIS BOOK WAS JUST A STORY.

08:56.500 --> 09:00.000
AND, YES, OBVIOUSLY ALL STORIES
DO COME FROM SOMEWHERE.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.433
- WELL, NOT ALL OF 'EM.

09:01.433 --> 09:02.533
- HMM?

09:02.533 --> 09:04.533
- I WAS JUST THINKING
SOMETHING--

09:04.533 --> 09:07.667
I WAS JUST THINKING SOME STORIES
COME FROM...

09:07.667 --> 09:10.700
LIKE THOSE SHOWS YOU GO TO
WHERE THEY SAY,

09:10.700 --> 09:12.100
"GIVE US A LOCATION,"

09:12.100 --> 09:14.833
AND THEN THE AUDIENCE GOES,
"AN ELEVATOR!"

09:14.833 --> 09:16.467
YOU KNOW, AND THEN THEY SAY,

09:16.467 --> 09:18.233
"WHAT LANGUAGE SHOULD WE DO"
OR SOMETHING.

09:18.233 --> 09:19.800
AND YOU GO, "FRENCH!"

09:19.800 --> 09:20.967
YOU KNOW,
AND THEN THEY DO

09:20.967 --> 09:22.800
A HILARIOUS THING RIGHT THERE.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.067
YOU KNOW?
"SECOND FLOOR. CROISSANTS."

09:25.067 --> 09:27.500
YOU KNOW?
YEAH.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.767
THEY JUST MAKE THAT STUFF UP
RIGHT THERE ON THE SPOT.

09:36.333 --> 09:41.100
SO THAT WOULD BE ONE EXAMPLE
WHERE SOME STORIES DO COME FROM.

09:41.100 --> 09:44.133
- IS THAT WHAT MICHAEL DID?

09:44.133 --> 09:46.167
- PROBABLY NOT.

09:49.033 --> 09:51.367
- PLEASE STOP.

09:51.367 --> 09:52.867
- I'M JUST--
I'M TALKING TO EILEEN.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.000
- EILEEN, UM,

09:55.000 --> 09:56.933
DID MICHAEL
SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?

09:56.933 --> 09:59.967
I MEAN, DID HE SAY
ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT HOME?

09:59.967 --> 10:02.533
- AND REMEMBER,
CHILDREN LIE.

10:02.533 --> 10:05.667
- RAY, WE HAVE
NOTHING TO HIDE.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.300
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S SO AFRAID OF,

10:07.300 --> 10:09.933
I MEAN,
'CAUSE WE'RE A NORMAL FAMILY,

10:09.933 --> 10:11.800
COMPARATIVELY.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.333
I MEAN, WATCH THE NEWS.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.100
[laughs nervously]

10:18.600 --> 10:20.333
- THAT WAS MINE,
THE NORMAL THING.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.300
SHE STOLE THAT FROM ME.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.100
- IT IS NOT YOUR THING.

10:24.100 --> 10:26.567
WE ARE NORMAL.

10:26.567 --> 10:29.100
- YOU KNOW,
WE DO HAVE COUNSELORS.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.933
FATHER HUBLEY IS VERY GOOD.

10:30.933 --> 10:32.933
- NO, NO, THAT'S
THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.533
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

10:34.533 --> 10:36.633
- BECAUSE THEN EVERYBODY'S
TALKIN' ABOUT IT--

10:36.633 --> 10:38.100
- WHAT ARE YOU--

10:38.100 --> 10:39.600
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE
SO CLOSED-MINDED?

10:39.600 --> 10:41.167
YOU SEE,
THIS IS THE ATTITUDE.

10:41.167 --> 10:42.533
- I'M NOT CLOSED-MINDED.

10:42.533 --> 10:44.700
- [scoffs]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW?

10:44.700 --> 10:45.867
THIS IS WHO YOU ARE.

10:45.867 --> 10:48.367
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
TALK ABOUT THINGS, HUH?

10:48.367 --> 10:49.533
TALK!

10:53.800 --> 10:55.333
-YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY

10:55.333 --> 10:57.500
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY EXHIBITING
SOME OF THE VERY TRAITS

10:57.500 --> 10:59.600
THAT SEEM TO JUMP OFF THE PAGE
IN MICHAEL'S BOOK.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.800
- WHO?
- OH...

11:01.800 --> 11:04.333
[stammers]
YOU.

11:04.333 --> 11:07.967
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.800
FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S NOT A BOOK.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.400
IT'S PIECES OF
CONSTRUCTION PAPER.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.100
- YOU SOUND A BIT CLOSED-MINDED.
- HEY.

11:19.467 --> 11:20.600
EILEEN...

11:20.600 --> 11:27.067
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH.

11:27.067 --> 11:30.033
WHEN I GOT MARRIED,
I DIDN'T JUST GET A HUSBAND.

11:30.033 --> 11:31.433
I GOT A WHOLE FREAK SHOW

11:31.433 --> 11:34.733
THAT SET UP THEIR TENT
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.933
AND THAT WOULD BE FINE,

11:40.933 --> 11:42.300
IF THEY STAYED THERE.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.900
BUT EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY,

11:44.900 --> 11:48.667
THEY DUMP A TRUCKLOAD
OF THEIR INSANE FAMILY DRECK

11:48.667 --> 11:49.733
INTO MY LAP.

11:49.733 --> 11:51.367
HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO SIT THROUGH

11:51.367 --> 11:52.667
TWO PEOPLE IN THEIR 60s

11:52.667 --> 11:55.100
FIGHTING OVER
WHO INVENTED THE LAWN?

11:55.100 --> 11:56.967
THE LAWN!

11:56.967 --> 11:58.333
AND THEN THE BROTHER:

11:58.333 --> 12:00.067
[mimicking Robert]
"I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.667
"I DON'T EVEN HAVE A LAWN.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.400
RAYMOND HAS A LAWN."

12:03.400 --> 12:05.600
BUT YOU CAN'T BLAME HIM
WHEN YOU SEE WHO THE MOTHER IS.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.900
SHE HAS THIS KIND OF SICK HOLD
ON THE BOTH OF THEM.

12:08.900 --> 12:11.033
AND THE FATHER'S ABOUT
AS DISGUSTING A CREATURE

12:11.033 --> 12:13.500
AS GOD HAS EVER DROPPED
ON THIS PLANET.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.433
SO NO WONDER
THE KID WRITES STORIES!

12:15.433 --> 12:16.967
I SHOULD BE
WRITING STORIES.

12:16.967 --> 12:18.333
MY LIFE IS A GOTHIC NOVEL,

12:18.333 --> 12:19.900
AND UNTIL YOU HAVE
LIVED IN THAT HOUSE

12:19.900 --> 12:22.467
WITH ALL OF THEM IN THERE
WITH YOU DAY AFTER DAY,

12:22.467 --> 12:25.167
WEEK AFTER WEEK,
YEAR AFTER FRIGGIN' YEAR,

12:25.167 --> 12:28.267
YOU ARE IN NO POSITION
TO JUDGE ME!

12:47.300 --> 12:49.533
- WHERE ARE YOU IN HERE,
ROBERT?

12:51.800 --> 12:53.367
- EXACTLY.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.433
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT CONCERNS ME.

12:57.433 --> 13:00.767
I WANT TO KNOW WHY I WAS DRAWN
COMPLETELY WITHOUT HAIR.

13:00.767 --> 13:03.333
THAT IS AN EXAGGERATION
WHICH I DO NOT APPRECIATE.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.300
- ALL RIGHT, NOW,

13:05.300 --> 13:07.133
ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S NO NEED FOR TENSION.

13:07.133 --> 13:08.600
WE ALL HAVE ENOUGH TENSION.

13:08.600 --> 13:14.333
BELIEVE ME, THIS JOB POUNDS
THE LIFE OUT OF YOU.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.767
EILEEN, MAYBE YOU'D
LIKE TO START WITH--

13:16.767 --> 13:17.800
- NO, THANK YOU.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.200
- WHAT?

13:22.600 --> 13:23.767
- LISTEN, EILEEN, AGAIN,

13:23.767 --> 13:26.100
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT
GETTING A LITTLE TESTY

13:26.100 --> 13:27.200
WITH YOU YESTERDAY.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.267
THAT'S REALLY NOT LIKE ME.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.567
- YEAH, YEAH, FINE, FINE.

13:31.567 --> 13:32.867
ADAM.

13:32.867 --> 13:34.733
ADAM IS
THE SCHOOL'S COUNSELOR,

13:34.733 --> 13:37.033
AND WE THOUGHT WE'D LIKE TO
HAVE THIS LITTLE TALK TODAY

13:37.033 --> 13:39.600
TO SEE IF MAYBE
WE CAN HELP YOU PEOPLE.

13:39.600 --> 13:40.767
OKAY?

13:42.500 --> 13:45.333
GO ON, ADAM.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.500
- SURE.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.200
HI, EVERYONE.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.700
I'M ADAM BURKE,
AND I AM THE SCHOOL'S COUNSELOR,

13:51.700 --> 13:54.900
BUT I LIKE TO THINK OF MYSELF
MORE AS A FACILITATOR.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.300
- OH, JEEZ.

13:58.300 --> 14:01.600
- SO HERE'S A QUESTION.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.600
DO ANY OF YOU EVER FEEL
THAT THE ANGER

14:04.600 --> 14:06.633
GETS OUT OF CONTROL?

14:06.633 --> 14:08.000
- NO WAY.
- NO, I REALLY DON'T.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.167
- YES.
- WHAT?

14:11.167 --> 14:12.467
- YES, I DO FEEL
THAT THE ANGER

14:12.467 --> 14:14.367
SOMETIMES GETS
OUT OF CONTROL.

14:14.367 --> 14:18.433
I FEEL IT WHENEVER
I COME INTO THE HOUSE.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.400
- THERE IS A SOLUTION.

14:25.767 --> 14:27.100
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.967
I AM THERE IN A LOVING,
NURTURING CAPACITY,

14:30.967 --> 14:33.267
AS IS MY WONT.

14:33.267 --> 14:36.800
- WELL, THEN,
MAYBE WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES,

14:36.800 --> 14:40.467
"WHERE COULD THE ANGER
IN THIS FAMILY BE COMING FROM?"

14:46.067 --> 14:47.367
- NO, ALL RIGHT.
I AM NOT GONNA--

14:47.367 --> 14:49.267
I DO NOT WANT TO SIT HERE!

14:49.267 --> 14:51.733
- NO, NO, NO. STOP, STOP.

14:55.267 --> 14:57.633
- I'M FINE.
MY APOLOGIES.

14:57.633 --> 14:59.167
RAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:59.167 --> 15:01.667
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE NEED TO
HEAR MY SIDE OF THINGS AGAIN.

15:01.667 --> 15:05.567
MAYBE YOU COULD
SAY SOMETHING OBJECTIVE.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.000
- OKAY.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.033
UH, ALL I KNOW IS...

15:18.900 --> 15:21.767
DEBRA'S GOOD.

15:21.767 --> 15:23.367
SHE'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

15:23.367 --> 15:26.033
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF STUFF TO DO,

15:26.033 --> 15:28.867
AND THAT'S WHY,

15:28.867 --> 15:31.733
IF SHE'S ALL...

15:42.033 --> 15:44.933
THAT'S WHY.

15:44.933 --> 15:46.133
- [clears throat loudly]

15:46.133 --> 15:49.300
IF I MAY...

15:49.300 --> 15:50.600
YOU MENTIONED,
FATHER HUBLEY,

15:50.600 --> 15:52.733
THAT I WAS NOT
INCLUDED IN THAT BOOK,

15:52.733 --> 15:56.700
AND THAT IS
A VERY ASTUTE OBSERVATION.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.167
AND I DO BELIEVE
THAT MY UNIQUE POSITION

15:59.167 --> 16:01.000
IN THIS FAMILY,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.133
AS THAT OF AN OUTSIDER,

16:03.133 --> 16:05.000
ALLOWS ME TO VIEW

16:05.000 --> 16:07.600
THIS HODGEPODGE OF LIFE

16:07.600 --> 16:11.033
FROM A RATHER UNIQUE
VANTAGE POINT.

16:11.033 --> 16:13.433
- TOP OF A BEANSTALK?

16:17.800 --> 16:19.133
- AND I DO MAINTAIN

16:19.133 --> 16:21.733
THAT IF ANYONE
IS TO BLAME, FATHER,

16:21.733 --> 16:24.267
FOR THIS RIVER
OF PENT-UP HOSTILITY

16:24.267 --> 16:25.700
THAT RUNS
THROUGH THIS SORRY BUNCH

16:25.700 --> 16:29.567
LIKE YOU-KNOW-WHAT
THROUGH A WE-KNOW-WHAT,

16:29.567 --> 16:33.000
THAT PERSON GOES BY
THE NAME OF RAYMOND.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.500
- OH, SIT DOWN, YOU DOPE.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.767
- HE IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN
THE CENTER:

16:37.767 --> 16:39.767
THE CENTER OF ATTENTION,

16:39.767 --> 16:41.400
THE CENTER OF AFFECTION.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.233
HE ALWAYS GETS
THE CENTER CHAIR IN THE KITCHEN.

16:44.233 --> 16:46.433
AND THIS ANGER
OF WHICH YOU SPEAK,

16:46.433 --> 16:48.967
FROM THE REST OF
THESE POOR SOULS,

16:48.967 --> 16:53.100
STEMS FROM HIS UNWILLINGNESS
TO SHARE

16:53.100 --> 16:55.633
EVEN THE TINIEST PORTION
OF THE SPOTLIGHT

16:55.633 --> 17:00.533
THAT SHINES,
WITHOUT END ON HIM.

17:03.233 --> 17:04.600
[screaming]

17:04.600 --> 17:07.733
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:07.733 --> 17:10.633
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:10.633 --> 17:11.767
"CENTER CHAIR."

17:11.767 --> 17:13.700
IT'S MY KITCHEN.
GET YOUR OWN KITCHEN.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.967
- THERE YOU GO,
YOU SEE,

17:14.967 --> 17:16.467
BECAUSE I ONLY HAVE
A KITCHENETTE,

17:16.467 --> 17:17.433
AND HE LOVES IT!

17:17.433 --> 17:18.733
RIGHT,
"RUB IT IN" RAYMOND?

17:18.733 --> 17:20.133
NO HOUSE FOR ME.

17:20.133 --> 17:22.500
NO WIFE, NO KIDS,
NO LAWN, NO NOTHIN'!

17:22.500 --> 17:24.700
- HEY, FATHER,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHIN'.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.967
WOULD YOU KNOW
WHO INVENTED THE LAWN?

17:26.967 --> 17:28.733
- OH!

17:28.733 --> 17:30.167
WOULD YOU STOP?

17:30.167 --> 17:31.533
NO ONE INVENTED IT.

17:31.533 --> 17:32.567
IT'S GRASS.

17:32.567 --> 17:33.400
- OH, YEAH?

17:33.400 --> 17:34.800
SO CAVEMEN HAD LAWNS?

17:34.800 --> 17:38.567
- YES, THEY WERE CALLED
"FIELDS," YOU BABOON.

17:38.567 --> 17:39.833
- YOU WANT TO KNOW

17:39.833 --> 17:41.900
WHERE ALL THE TENSION
IN THE FAMILY COMES FROM?

17:41.900 --> 17:43.800
I'M CHAINED TO IT.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.533
HERE SHE IS.

17:45.533 --> 17:47.600
AND IF YOU'RE LOOKIN' TO
FIND OUT WHY SHE'S LIKE THIS,

17:47.600 --> 17:50.467
I'M GIVIN' IT TO YOU,
FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL.

17:50.467 --> 17:52.667
YOU READY?

17:52.667 --> 17:55.233
THERE, RIGHT THERE!

17:55.233 --> 17:57.400
SHE MARRIED HIM!

17:57.400 --> 17:59.667
AND THIS ONE STILL
CAN'T DEAL WITH IT!

18:07.100 --> 18:10.233
- HOW DARE YOU?

18:10.233 --> 18:12.533
- IT-IT-IT'S ALL RIGHT, MRS.--
- YOU HOLD ON.

18:14.900 --> 18:18.167
YOU THINK MICHAEL'S BOOK
IS MY FAULT, DON'T YOU?

18:18.167 --> 18:20.433
DON'T YOU, HUH?

18:20.433 --> 18:22.933
IF THERE'S EVER A PROBLEM
IN THE FAMILY, IT'S THE MOTHER.

18:22.933 --> 18:24.967
IT'S ALWAYS THE MOTHER.

18:24.967 --> 18:27.567
WELL, YOU ALL OUGHT TO BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

18:27.567 --> 18:31.533
AND YOU, YOU--
YOU ALLOW THAT, FATHER HUBLEY?

18:31.533 --> 18:33.233
SHAME ON YOU.

18:33.233 --> 18:35.200
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HAD A MOTHER.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.000
AND YOU ALLOW
ALL THIS TO HAPPEN

18:37.000 --> 18:38.400
IN YOUR SCHOOL,
IN YOUR PARISH.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.033
THIS "NEW PSYCHOLOGY,"

18:40.033 --> 18:41.800
THAT CHILDREN
ARE ALWAYS RIGHT.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.600
THEY'RE BEING REWARDED
FOR EVERY LITTLE THING THEY DO

18:44.600 --> 18:45.900
WITH THE STICKERS.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.100
I MEAN, THESE KIDS
ARE COMIN' HOME FULL OF STICKERS

18:48.100 --> 18:49.767
FOR DOING NOTHING!

18:49.767 --> 18:52.067
"OOH, I WENT TO THE POTTY."

18:52.067 --> 18:53.600
"HERE'S A STICKER."

18:55.133 --> 18:58.033
IN MY DAY,
YOU HAD TO EARN A REWARD,

18:58.033 --> 18:59.267
AND EVEN THEN,
YOU DIDN'T GET IT.

18:59.267 --> 19:00.833
AND IF THERE WAS
YELLING IN THE HOUSE,

19:00.833 --> 19:02.100
YOU EARNED THAT TOO.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.400
THERE WAS NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.733
I WANT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

19:04.733 --> 19:06.500
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH THIS FAMILY.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.400
WE'RE VERY CLOSE.
WE'RE VERY OPEN.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.733
WE'RE VERY LOVING,
'CAUSE I MAKE SURE OF IT.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.300
BUT EVERYBODY
HAS TO MAKE A BIG DEAL.

19:13.300 --> 19:14.900
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MEETING.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.067
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN INQUIRY.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.833
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A WITCH HUNT.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.733
- I THINK THEY FOUND ONE.

19:30.033 --> 19:34.800
- WELL, THANK YOU, EVERYBODY,

19:34.800 --> 19:38.867
FOR A LOVELY MORNING.

19:38.867 --> 19:40.467
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

19:40.467 --> 19:43.133
I DO UNDERSTAND
THE PRESSURES AND TENSIONS

19:43.133 --> 19:45.433
OF RAISING A FAMILY
IN TODAY'S WORLD.

19:45.433 --> 19:49.767
BUT I THINK
THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY

19:49.767 --> 19:51.433
COMPOUNDS THE PROBLEM

19:51.433 --> 19:54.067
BY MAYBE BEING A BIT TOO CLOSE
TO EACH OTHER CONSTANTLY,

19:54.067 --> 19:57.933
LIKE PING-PONG BALLS POUNDING
AND HITTING OFF EACH OTHER

19:57.933 --> 20:00.433
IN THE LOTTERY MACHINE.

20:00.433 --> 20:06.067
EXCEPT NOBODY WINS IN THIS ONE,

20:06.067 --> 20:07.933
LEAST OF ALL
THE CHILDREN,

20:07.933 --> 20:11.333
WHICH IS WHAT I GOT
FROM THIS BOOK.

20:11.333 --> 20:19.800
SO IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU, OR YOU,
OR YOU, OR YOU,

20:19.800 --> 20:22.933
OR EVEN RAYMOND TODAY.

20:22.933 --> 20:25.200
IT'S ABOUT
THIS LITTLE GUY

20:25.200 --> 20:29.000
AND THIS SWEET, SIMPLE WAY
OF MAYBE

20:29.000 --> 20:31.267
GIVING YOU A MESSAGE.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.133
- [sniffles]

20:44.233 --> 20:47.367
[softly crying]

20:51.633 --> 20:54.633
- NOW, WE HAVE
THESE PARENTING BOOKS

20:54.633 --> 20:56.200
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT--

20:56.200 --> 20:59.567
- I'LL TRY ONE.
- OH, I'LL TAKE ONE.

20:59.567 --> 21:01.700
- WE'LL TAKE 'EM ALL.
WE'LL TAKE 'EM ALL.

21:01.700 --> 21:03.567
- NOW, NOW, GIVE ME ONE.
THEY'RE NOT ALL FOR YOU.

21:03.567 --> 21:05.767
- RELAX, DAD.
YOU'RE GONNA GET ONE!

21:11.267 --> 21:12.533
HEY!
- HEY!

21:12.533 --> 21:15.067
- COME HERE, YOU.
- COME HERE.

21:15.067 --> 21:16.367
- WHAT'D YOU DO,
GO TO THE BATHROOM?

21:16.367 --> 21:18.000
- YEAH, YOUR LIGHT'S ON.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.567
- YEAH, THAT'S 'CAUSE
WE'RE READIN'.

21:19.567 --> 21:21.133
- WE'RE READIN'
A COUPLE BOOKS HERE.

21:21.133 --> 21:22.900
GIVE ME THAT HEAD.
GIVE ME THAT.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.033
HEY, IT'S TIME FOR BED, DUDE.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.533
- OKAY?
- COME ON.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.833
SEE YA TOMORROW, OKAY?
- SEE YOU IN THE MORNING, HONEY.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.433
HEY, LISTEN, MICHAEL,

21:29.433 --> 21:31.433
WE REALLY LOVED
YOUR STORY YOU WROTE,

21:31.433 --> 21:33.000
AND WE LEARNED A LOT
FROM IT.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.733
- I LIKE THAT CARTOON.

21:34.733 --> 21:36.067
- WHAT CARTOON?

21:36.067 --> 21:37.800
- "MONSTER MANIACS."

21:37.800 --> 21:38.933
THEY'RE REALLY FUNNY.

21:38.933 --> 21:40.333
THEY'RE ALWAYS YELLING.
