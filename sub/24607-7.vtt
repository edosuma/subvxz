WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:02.219
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.263 --> 00:06.006
MADI IS NOT
A THREAT TO OCTAVIA.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.181
SHE'S A CHILD.

00:07.224 --> 00:09.226
GAIA: YES,
A NIGHTBLOOD CHILD.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.881
CLARKE: OCTAVIA,
GET AWAY FROM HER.

00:11.924 --> 00:14.710
MADI: CLARKE, IT'S OK.
I CAME TO HER.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.103
DIYOZA: THE VALLEY IS OURS.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.148
SO IF THIS IS THE LAST
LIVING VALLEY ON EARTH,

00:18.192 --> 00:20.063
THEN IT SHOULD
BE OURS.

00:20.107 --> 00:23.066
WE HAVE EVERYTHING--
THE WEAPONS, EYE IN THE SKY.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.502
THEY HAVE NOTHING.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.591
WE'RE THE ONLY THING
THAT CAN DEFEAT US.

00:26.635 --> 00:30.117
YOUR PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY, AND
YOU'RE WORRYING ABOUT DEFECTORS.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.293
WE SHOULD START TRYING TO FIND
A WAY BACK TO THAT VALLEY.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.251
OCTAVIA: WHEN THAT SHIP
COMES BACK,

00:34.295 --> 00:36.166
PEOPLE WILL TRY TO DEFECT.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.733
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.082
COME ON!

00:39.126 --> 00:40.431
BELLAMY: MONTY CAN'T HACK
THE EYE FROM HERE.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.651
THERE'S A PROGRAM ON IT
WHICH OPENS THE BACK DOOR

00:42.694 --> 00:44.261
TO THEIR SYSTEM.

00:44.305 --> 00:47.264
MONTY: GET IT TO RAVEN.
SHE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:50.180 --> 00:54.228
DIYOZA: LIKE EACH OF US,
SOMEHOW THIS VALLEY SURVIVED.

00:54.271 --> 00:56.143
IT'S THE LAST
SANCTUARY ON EARTH,

00:56.186 --> 00:57.448
AND WE ARE
ITS KEEPERS.

01:00.277 --> 01:03.411
MAN: YEAH.
ALL RIGHT. WHOO!

01:03.454 --> 01:08.329
TO BUILD A LIFE HERE,
WE ALL HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:08.372 --> 01:10.113
YOU WILL, TOO.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.550
ALL OF US LEFT POLIS
FOR A BETTER WAY,

01:12.594 --> 01:15.205
AND ALL OF US MUST DO
OUR PART TO GET IT.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.120
I'LL BE SITTING DOWN
WITH EACH OF YOU

01:17.164 --> 01:19.209
TO LEARN YOUR STORIES,

01:19.253 --> 01:22.212
TO HEAR WHAT SKILLS YOU CAN
BRING TO THE COMMUNITY,

01:22.256 --> 01:24.301
HOW YOU CAN HE HELPFUL,

01:24.345 --> 01:27.565
AND TO SEE
IF YOU CAN BE TRUSTED.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.134
UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN CLEARED,
YOUR PULSE COLLARS

01:31.178 --> 01:34.268
HAVE BEEN GEOTAGGED
TO THIS BUILDING.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.226
WELCOME HOME.

01:40.883 --> 01:43.973
ABBY?

01:44.016 --> 01:45.279
ABBY?

01:51.415 --> 01:53.243
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED?

01:53.287 --> 01:54.897
I GOT THE BULLET OUT,
BUT THERE WAS

01:54.940 --> 01:57.029
TOO MUCH
INTERNAL DAMAGE.

01:57.073 --> 01:59.641
I DID EVERYTHING
I COULD.

02:01.251 --> 02:04.602
WAS THAT BEFORE OR
AFTER YOU TOOK THESE?

02:04.646 --> 02:07.475
SHE WAS SHOT,
MARCUS.

02:07.518 --> 02:10.347
OCTAVIA BLAKE
KILLED HER, NOT ME.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.958
KARINA CAME HERE
FOR A SECOND CHANCE.

02:13.002 --> 02:16.048
I DID EVERYTHING
I COULD.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.268
HEY!

02:18.312 --> 02:22.229
HEY, I PUT MY LIFE
ON THE LINE FOR YOU,

02:22.272 --> 02:24.144
AND YOU PROMISED ME
THAT YOU WOULD QUIT.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.362
AND I WILL.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.277
STOP LYING.
IT'S GETTING WORSE.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.800
YOU TAKE ONE PILL TO WORK
AND THEN ANOTHER TO SLEEP.

02:28.844 --> 02:31.629
GIVE ME THE BOTTLE.

02:31.673 --> 02:35.372
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
OUR SECOND CHANCE.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.244
-THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
-WRONG.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.985
WE'RE HERE
BECAUSE OF ME,

02:40.029 --> 02:41.378
BECAUSE I SERVE
A PURPOSE,

02:41.422 --> 02:43.728
AND I CAN ONLY
SERVE THAT PURPOSE

02:43.772 --> 02:46.296
IF I'M FUNCTIONING.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.298
IF I DON'T FIND
A CURE SOON,

02:48.342 --> 02:50.648
PEOPLE ARE
GONNA START DYING.

02:52.998 --> 02:56.176
PEOPLE ARE
ALREADY DYING,

02:56.219 --> 02:57.307
AND YOU CALL THIS
FUNCTIONING?

02:57.351 --> 02:58.961
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
CLOSE HER UP.

02:59.004 --> 03:02.138
I DID EVERYTHING
I COULD!

03:02.182 --> 03:05.141
IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

03:47.792 --> 03:51.056
HARPER: BELLAMY, YOU'VE BEEN
STARING AT THAT ALL NIGHT.

03:51.100 --> 03:55.278
GO. GET SOME SLEEP, OK?
I GOT THIS.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.759
IT'S BEEN 8 HOURS.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.587
RAVEN COULD HAVE BUILT
A CATHEDRAL BY NOW.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.806
THEY'LL GET IT DONE.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.286
I KNOW.

04:03.330 --> 04:07.029
I JUST WISH IT
WAS ME OVER THERE.

04:10.685 --> 04:13.383
WELL

04:14.515 --> 04:16.647
LIKE, WE KNEW IT WOULD
TAKE SOME TIME.

04:16.691 --> 04:17.866
WE CAN COUNT
ON ECHO.

04:17.909 --> 04:21.435
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST
TIME SHE BETRAYED US.

04:21.478 --> 04:22.958
IF YOUR BROTHER
TRUSTS HER,

04:23.001 --> 04:25.308
MAYBE WE
SHOULD, TOO.

04:25.352 --> 04:28.268
YOU'RE STILL UPSET
WE SHOT THE TRAITORS.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.747
I GET HOW THAT
MUST LOOK TO YOU,

04:29.791 --> 04:33.490
BUT WE'RE FIGHTING FOR
OUR LIVES HERE, BELLAMY.

04:33.534 --> 04:38.930
THE HYDROFARM
IS ON ITS LAST LEGS.

04:38.974 --> 04:41.977
TRUTH IS,
IT'S A MIRACLE

04:42.020 --> 04:43.500
YOU SHOWED UP
WHEN YOU DID.

04:43.544 --> 04:46.373
I HAVEN'T THANKED YOU
ENOUGH FOR THAT.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.549
IF WE CAN JUST GET
TO SHALLOW VALLEY,

04:48.592 --> 04:51.465
THINGS WILL BE
BETTER, I PROMISE.

04:54.337 --> 04:57.384
FUNNY, THAT'S
THE SAME THING

04:57.427 --> 05:00.300
WE SAID ABOUT GETTING
BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.739
THEN WE FOUND YOU.

05:16.185 --> 05:18.535
YOUR SISTER
OFFICIALLY SCARES ME.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.937
OK.

05:34.159 --> 05:36.901
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, HEY.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.773
CANTEEN.

05:38.816 --> 05:41.384
I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE
GONNA HAVE WATER THERE.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.386
TAKE IT ANYWAY.

05:43.430 --> 05:46.389
CLARKE, I'M NOT
A BABY ANYMORE.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.478
I KNOW, WHICH IS WHY
PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY

05:48.522 --> 05:50.698
TO NOTICE HOW
SPECIAL YOU ARE,

05:50.741 --> 05:54.571
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE GONNA SUCK TODAY.

05:54.615 --> 05:57.531
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
STAND OUT IN ANY WAY.

05:57.574 --> 06:00.577
NO ONE CAN THINK THAT
YOU'D MAKE A GOOD COMMANDER,

06:00.621 --> 06:03.841
NOT GAIA AND ESPECIALLY
NOT OCTAVIA.

06:03.885 --> 06:06.670
CLARKE,
I UNDERSTAND.

06:06.714 --> 06:09.586
ONCE ECHO GETS THAT
CAMERA IN THE SKY DOWN,

06:09.630 --> 06:11.588
WE ALL GET TO GO
HOME TO SHALLOW VALLEY.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.417
GREAT. MAYBE WHEN
WE FIGHT THE WAR THERE,

06:14.461 --> 06:16.550
I WON'T
HAVE TO SUCK.

06:40.748 --> 06:44.839
HARPER TOLD ME I MIGHT
FIND YOU DOWN HERE.

06:44.882 --> 06:47.407
I MISS
MY ALGAE FARM.

06:47.450 --> 06:50.453
I THOUGHT BEING AROUND
ALL THIS MIGHT HELP.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.673
DOES IT?

06:52.716 --> 06:55.502
MOST OF THE CROPS
ARE FALLOW.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.547
THE EQUIPMENT
NEEDS REPAIR.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.680
I GIVE IT 3 WEEKS
UNTIL THIS PLACE

06:59.723 --> 07:02.596
IS AS DEAD
AS THE WASTELAND.

07:02.639 --> 07:07.557
OH. UH, I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO GIVE THIS TO YOU.

07:07.601 --> 07:10.604
IT JUST NEVER REALLY
FELT LIKE THE RIGHT TIME.

07:12.475 --> 07:15.391
JASPER'S
HANDWRITING.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.569
I FOUND IT AT ARKADIA
NOT LONG AFTER PRAIFAYA.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.486
I NEARLY READ IT
A COUPLE OF TIMES,

07:23.530 --> 07:26.446
BUT NOW I'M GLAD
I DIDN'T.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.105
COOPER: GUARD THE DOOR.
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.933
MAN: OK.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.676
COME ON. GO. GO.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.919
COOPER: LET'S GO.

08:17.584 --> 08:20.543
MONTY, YOU CAN'T PICK
A LOCK WITH PRUNING SHEARS.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.939
UH! AH...

08:24.982 --> 08:27.550
YE OF LITTLE FAITH.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.683
THE KEYPAD ENERGIZES
THE SOLENOID,

08:29.726 --> 08:32.207
PULLS THE COIL
AND PIN BACK.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.731
A MAGNET...

08:34.775 --> 08:37.081
CAN DO
THE SAME THING.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.585
MONTY: BIOCONTAINMENT LAB?
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT FOR?

09:02.629 --> 09:04.718
CLARKE:
LET'S FIND OUT.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.122
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.612
OH, MY GOD.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.225
YOU SAID NO ONE ELSE
WAS BITTEN.

09:34.269 --> 09:37.751
NO. THEY WEREN'T.
I DON'T--

09:37.794 --> 09:40.623
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY WOULD SHE--

09:43.452 --> 09:47.021
THEY'RE
BREEDING THEM.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.302
THE COLD MUST
SLOW THEM DOWN.

10:07.345 --> 10:10.697
CLARKE, IF OCTAVIA CAN DELIVER
THESE WORMS IN A DEFECTOR--

10:13.221 --> 10:15.092
CLARKE: HE'S ALIVE.

10:40.901 --> 10:43.643
HEY, SPACEWALKER.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.561
FINALLY. TELL ME
THIS IS A RESCUE OP.

10:49.605 --> 10:52.042
IT WON'T BE ANYTHING
IF WE CAN'T GET

10:52.086 --> 10:54.741
OUT OF THIS CHURCH.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.788
I'M BETTING, BY NOW,

10:58.832 --> 11:02.966
MY GIRL'S FIGURED OUT
HOW TO SLIP HER COLLAR.

11:04.707 --> 11:05.926
THEY'RE WATCHING US,

11:05.969 --> 11:07.841
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED YOU TO SEE.

11:07.884 --> 11:10.234
LET'S GO GET
SOME WATER.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.671
MONTY SAID I NEED
TO INSERT IT

11:11.714 --> 11:12.933
INTO ANY CONSOLE
CONNECTED

11:12.976 --> 11:15.718
TO THE TRANSPORT SHIP'S
PRIMARY SERVER.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.811
IT'S ESSENTIALLY
A KEYLOGGER,

11:21.855 --> 11:23.204
AUTO-INSTALLS
AND OPENS A BACK DOOR

11:23.247 --> 11:26.033
TO THEIR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM
THAT ONLY MONTY CAN SEE.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.165
HEH. IT'S BRILLIANT.

11:28.209 --> 11:29.689
TOO BAD WE CAN'T
GET TO THE BRIDGE

11:29.732 --> 11:31.342
WITHOUT OUR HEADS
EXPLODING.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.562
WHAT ABOUT KANE?
MAYBE HE--

11:33.605 --> 11:36.696
I SAW HIM.
HE'S WITH DIYOZA.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.436
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIM IN THAT BUNKER,

11:38.480 --> 11:40.743
BUT HE'S DIFFERENT.

11:40.787 --> 11:44.704
YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN THEM, RAVEN.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.968
THEY'RE ALL
DIFFERENT.

11:49.578 --> 11:53.016
ECHO: MURPHY SAID YOU HAD
SOMEONE INSIDE THEIR CAMP.

11:58.195 --> 11:59.980
ECHO:
CAN WE TRUST HIM?

12:00.023 --> 12:02.417
RAVEN: I HOPE SO.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.941
HE'S OUR ONLY SHOT.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.859
HEY, CAN WE TALK?

12:09.903 --> 12:12.862
YOU AND ME HAVE
NOTHING TO DISCUSS.

12:24.178 --> 12:27.659
I HAVE SOME
UNFORTUNATE NEWS.

12:27.703 --> 12:30.271
KARINA'S DEAD.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.621
SHE WAS
LOUWODA KLIRON KRU,

12:32.664 --> 12:36.494
SO THE RITES WILL BE
PERFORMED THIS AFTERNOON.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.847
TOGETHER, WE CAN MAKE SURE

12:40.890 --> 12:44.807
THAT HER DEATH
WILL NOT BE IN VAIN.

12:58.821 --> 13:01.955
BELLAMY: MY SISTER NEVER
APPROVED OF HUMAN TESTING.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.435
I DON'T CARE HOW CRAZY
IT'S BECOME DOWN HERE.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.307
DESPERATION
HAS A WAY OF MAKING

13:06.350 --> 13:08.439
THE UNIMAGINABLE
A NECESSITY.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.964
STILL, IF SHE
WEAPONIZES THOSE THINGS

13:11.007 --> 13:13.705
AND SENDS THEM
INTO THE VALLEY,

13:13.749 --> 13:18.841
THEN ECHO, RAVEN,
MURPHY, KANE, YOUR MOM--

13:18.885 --> 13:21.801
NOT JUST THEM.
ALL OF US.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.759
UNLEASHING
AN INVASIVE SPECIES

13:23.803 --> 13:25.805
ON THE LAST ARABLE
LAND ON EARTH

13:25.848 --> 13:28.503
IS A MONUMENTALLY
BAD IDEA.

13:30.070 --> 13:33.900
EVEN IF OCTAVIA DOES KNOW,
SHE WON'T LISTEN TO ME.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.906
WE NEED HELP.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.043
BE DIPLOMATIC.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.784
YEAH.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.354
CLARKE, HE WAS THERE
WHEN PIKE SHOT HER

13:53.397 --> 13:57.097
AND KILLED 300
OF HER PEOPLE.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.750
I'LL GO WITH HIM.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.927
YEAH.
I'LL RELIEVE HARPER.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.234
CAN I TALK TO YOU

14:04.278 --> 14:06.889
PRIVATELY?

14:06.933 --> 14:09.892
CLARKE: HEY, WE NEED
TO TALK TO INDRA.

14:23.688 --> 14:26.039
REAL DIPLOMATIC.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.915
INDRA, WOULD COOPER
DO SOMETHING

14:32.959 --> 14:34.656
WITHOUT MY SISTER'S
APPROVAL?

14:34.699 --> 14:36.614
ONLY IF SHE
GOT MINE FIRST,

14:36.658 --> 14:37.964
BUT SINCE I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THE HELL

14:38.007 --> 14:41.315
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

14:41.358 --> 14:44.448
SHE BROUGHT
BACK THE WORMS.

14:44.492 --> 14:48.539
BELLAMY: SHE'S BREEDING THEM,
EXPERIMENTING ON DEFECTORS.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.499
ONE OF THEM
IS STILL ALIVE.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.109
WHY WOULD SHE
DO THAT?

14:53.153 --> 14:55.329
CLARKE: MY GUESS--
TRYING TO FIND A WAY

14:55.372 --> 14:56.896
TO KEEP THEM DORMANT
LONG ENOUGH

14:56.939 --> 14:59.507
TO DELIVER THEM
IN THE NEXT DEFECTION.

14:59.550 --> 15:02.205
GOOD PLAN.

15:03.554 --> 15:06.079
SHOW ME.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.312
I'M ALONE.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.924
TOLD THEM
I DON'T DO FUNERALS.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.927
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT?

15:27.970 --> 15:30.886
LETTING MURPHY GO
BIT ME IN THE ASS.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.844
MCCREARY AND TWO
OF OUR PEOPLE ARE MISSING,

15:32.888 --> 15:34.934
AND NOW DIYOZA'S STARTING
TO QUESTION MY LOYALTY,

15:34.977 --> 15:38.894
SO MAKE IT QUICK,
OR I'M LEAVING.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.984
I WANT TO BE
USEFUL HERE.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.334
I CAN'T BE
LOCKED UP ANYMORE.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.597
USEFUL HOW?

15:46.641 --> 15:48.991
WHEN I WAS ON
YOUR MOTHERSHIP,

15:49.035 --> 15:50.862
I SAW THE
HYTHYLODIUM TANKS.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.039
THEY'RE ALMOST FULL,
THOUSANDS OF TONS.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.998
JUST ONE DROP, AND I CAN
POWER UP THIS ENTIRE VILLAGE.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.608
IF YOU FLY ME
UP THERE--

15:57.652 --> 15:59.088
HYTHYLODIUM
IS KILLING EVERYONE

15:59.132 --> 16:01.743
IT CAME INTO CONTACT WITH,
SO BRINGING IT DOWN HERE

16:01.786 --> 16:04.137
JUST MAY BE THE WORST
IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD.

16:07.140 --> 16:10.621
SO WHAT IF DIYOZA
QUESTIONS YOUR LOYALTY?

16:10.665 --> 16:12.536
HOW COULD YOU BE
LOYAL TO SOMEONE

16:12.580 --> 16:14.625
WHO COLLARS PEOPLE
LIKE ANIMALS,

16:14.669 --> 16:16.366
TORTURES THEM,

16:16.410 --> 16:19.152
SOMEONE WHO
KILLED YOUR CREW?

16:19.195 --> 16:22.242
I SAW HER FILE.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.853
SHE MURDERED HUNDREDS
OF INNOCENT PEOPLE,

16:24.896 --> 16:26.724
BLEW UP GOVERNMENT
BUILDINGS

16:26.768 --> 16:29.423
JUST BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T
LIKE THEIR POLICIES.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.686
SHAW, YOU'RE GOOD.

16:31.729 --> 16:34.558
I CAN SEE IT
IN YOUR EYES.

16:34.602 --> 16:37.518
WHEN I WAS A KID

16:37.561 --> 16:40.086
AFTER THE BATTLE
OF SAN FRANCISCO,

16:40.129 --> 16:43.263
I WATCHED THE
EVACUATION ON TV,

16:43.306 --> 16:45.569
THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES
BEING PACKED

16:45.613 --> 16:47.484
INTO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS.

16:47.528 --> 16:50.226
I REMEMBER SEEING SOLDIERS
PUSHING HELICOPTERS OVERBOARD

16:50.270 --> 16:53.142
JUST TO MAKE MORE ROOM,
AND DIYOZA WAS THERE.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.840
SHE WAS THE ONE
GIVING THE ORDERS.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.712
THE MACHINES
WERE EXPENDABLE,

16:57.755 --> 17:01.281
BUT THE PEOPLE WEREN'T,
BUT UP IN SPACE

17:01.324 --> 17:04.153
WHEN WE REPORTED THAT
THE MINERS WERE GETTING SICK,

17:04.197 --> 17:07.113
ELIGIUS SAW IT
DIFFERENTLY.

17:07.156 --> 17:10.246
ORDER ELEVEN CAME DOWN--

17:10.290 --> 17:14.076
"BRING HOME THE HYTHYLODIUM.
LEAVE THE PRISONERS,"

17:14.120 --> 17:16.209
LIKE THEY WERE GARBAGE.

17:16.252 --> 17:21.040
CAPTAIN STEVENS AGREED,
AND I DIDN'T.

17:23.085 --> 17:26.132
YOU DEACTIVATED
THE SHOCK COLLARS.

17:28.003 --> 17:31.137
SO, YOU SEE, DIYOZA'S
NOT AS BAD AS YOU THINK,

17:31.180 --> 17:33.748
AND...

17:33.791 --> 17:36.446
I'M NOT AS GOOD
AS YOU HOPED.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.021
DIYOZA: WHY DID YOU
CHOOSE TO DEFECT?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.197
ECHO:
I DIDN'T DEFECT.

17:48.241 --> 17:50.330
I FLED.

17:50.373 --> 17:53.202
I'M NOT WONKRU,

17:53.246 --> 17:55.117
BUT YOU ALREADY
KNEW THAT.

17:55.161 --> 17:58.207
KANE: SO YOU SURVIVED IN SPACE
WITH BELLAMY AND THE OTHERS.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.818
YES, BUT NOW
THAT WE'RE BACK,

18:00.862 --> 18:02.298
OCTAVIA'S BANISHMENT
STILL STANDS.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.213
I'M SURPRISED
SHE LET YOU LIVE.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.997
AS YOU SAW,
SHE ALMOST DIDN'T.

18:06.041 --> 18:09.697
OCTAVIA'S TAKEN
EVERYTHING FROM ME.

18:09.740 --> 18:13.135
MY CLAN
NO LONGER EXISTS.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.268
I'M COMING TO YOU
FOR SAFE HARBOR

18:15.311 --> 18:18.314
BECAUSE I HAVE
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

18:18.358 --> 18:21.665
YOUR STORY'S
OUR STORY, ECHO,

18:21.709 --> 18:23.189
SO...

18:25.321 --> 18:28.194
HOW CAN YOU BE
USEFUL IN MY CAMP?

18:28.237 --> 18:30.326
I'M A SPY.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.417
YOU KNEW THAT, TOO.

18:34.461 --> 18:37.986
MM-HMM, AND AN HONEST SPY
IS EITHER INCOMPETENT

18:38.029 --> 18:40.162
OR WORKING AN ANGLE.

18:40.206 --> 18:43.209
WHICH ARE YOU?

18:43.252 --> 18:46.429
TIME WILL TELL.
THANK YOU, ECHO.

18:54.568 --> 18:58.615
YOU'RE NOT YOUR USUAL
CHATTY SELF TODAY, KANE.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.313
IS IT KARINA?

19:00.356 --> 19:01.879
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
THAT GIRL DIED.

19:01.923 --> 19:04.186
NO.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.232
IT'S YOURS.

19:08.582 --> 19:12.107
I SAW THE ELIGIUS LOGO
ON ABBY'S PILLS.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.239
KARINA DIED
BECAUSE HER DOCTOR

19:13.282 --> 19:14.675
WAS TOO HIGH
TO OPERATE.

19:14.718 --> 19:18.200
REALLY? HERE, I THOUGHT
IT WAS THE BULLET.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.680
YOU NEED TO CUT
HER SUPPLY.

19:19.723 --> 19:20.855
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

19:20.898 --> 19:22.422
BECAUSE SHE'LL BE
A BETTER DOCTOR.

19:22.465 --> 19:26.077
MAYBE...IF SHE
SURVIVES DETOX.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.383
OF COURSE, IF WE FORCE HER,
THEN WE WIND UP

19:27.427 --> 19:29.342
WITH A CLEAN JUNKIE
WHO'S JUST THINKING

19:29.385 --> 19:30.691
ABOUT HER NEXT FIX

19:30.734 --> 19:32.823
AND NOT HOW TO FIND
A CURE FOR MY PEOPLE.

19:32.867 --> 19:35.522
SO WHAT?
ARE YOU SICK?

19:35.565 --> 19:38.916
IF NOT, I THINK
IT'S A GREAT WAY

19:38.960 --> 19:40.222
TO GET RID OF
SOME OF THESE--

19:40.266 --> 19:43.443
WHAT, KANE,
UNDESIRABLES,

19:43.486 --> 19:45.923
KIND OF LIKE SENDING
100 JUVENILE DELINQUENTS

19:45.967 --> 19:48.187
TO DIE ON THE GROUND
OR ABANDONING

19:48.230 --> 19:51.712
300 PRISONERS
ON AN ASTEROID?

19:53.017 --> 19:55.237
ARE YOU SICK?

19:55.281 --> 19:57.239
ABBY SAID YOU WOULDN'T
LET HER EXAMINE YOU.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.545
I'M NOT SICK.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.416
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST SAYING,

20:00.460 --> 20:02.766
IF YOU ARE,
YOU CAN TRUST HER

20:02.810 --> 20:04.377
TO KEEP IT QUIET.

20:04.420 --> 20:08.381
TRUST HER?
SHE'S A DRUG ADDICT.

20:08.424 --> 20:11.166
HA HA! TOO SOON?

20:12.515 --> 20:14.822
GO GET THE NEXT
DEFECTOR.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.264
GAIA: STRIKE HIGH. DEFEND.

20:22.308 --> 20:26.747
STRIKE LOW. FOCUS.
STRONG STANCES.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.793
AGAIN. STRIKE HIGH.

20:29.837 --> 20:33.667
DEFEND. STRIKE LOW.

20:33.710 --> 20:36.060
-DEFEND.
-UH!

20:36.104 --> 20:38.280
GAIA: HOLD. ETHAN...

20:52.120 --> 20:53.687
GAIA: ENOUGH.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.866
I EXPECT MORE
FROM WONKRU WARRIORS--

20:58.909 --> 21:02.391
HONOR, STRENGTH, AND UNITY.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.175
WE'LL BE AT WAR SOON,

21:04.219 --> 21:06.787
AND THERE'S NOTHING
FUNNY ABOUT THAT.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.442
GET TO CLASS.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.880
NOT YOU, MADI.

21:26.633 --> 21:30.332
THAT DID NOT LOOK LIKE A
GIRL WITH 3 KILLS IN BATTLE.

21:32.073 --> 21:35.424
SORRY, SEDA.
I'LL TRY HARDER.

21:36.904 --> 21:39.776
NO. DON'T.

21:41.561 --> 21:46.348
CLARKE TOLD YOU TO
HOLD BACK, DIDN'T SHE?

21:46.392 --> 21:49.438
YOU ARE WISE
TO LISTEN TO HER.

21:49.482 --> 21:52.398
UNFORTUNATELY, IT
WAS FAR TOO OBVIOUS.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.095
FROM YOUR FIRST ADVANCE,
IT WAS CLEAR

21:54.138 --> 21:55.575
THAT YOU WERE
HIDING SOMETHING.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.316
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
A MUCH BETTER JOB OF IT

21:57.359 --> 21:59.361
TOMORROW WHEN WE
DRILL FOR OCTAVIA.

21:59.405 --> 22:04.323
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU WANT ME TO FAIL, TOO?

22:05.628 --> 22:09.371
I WANT YOU TO LIVE.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.504
CAN I SHOW YOU
SOMETHING?

22:23.777 --> 22:26.562
MADI, IT'S OK.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.390
MOST OF WONKRU
BELIEVES THE TIME

22:28.434 --> 22:30.740
OF THE COMMANDERS
IS OVER.

22:30.784 --> 22:33.526
I BELIEVED IT, TOO.

22:33.569 --> 22:36.224
THEN I MET YOU.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.792
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.533
AS I TOLD CLARKE,

22:40.576 --> 22:44.101
I WOULD NEVER FORCE
YOU TO ACCEPT THIS.

22:44.145 --> 22:47.496
IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T IT?

22:53.763 --> 22:55.765
YES.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.508
DOES OCTAVIA
KNOW YOU HAVE IT?

22:59.552 --> 23:01.597
YES, AND AS LONG
AS BLODREINA REIGNS,

23:01.641 --> 23:04.078
I WILL SERVE HER
FAITHFULLY,

23:04.121 --> 23:06.559
BUT I CAN'T JUST
FORGET MY FAITH

23:06.602 --> 23:08.474
OR MY OATH TO
PROTECT THE FLAME

23:08.517 --> 23:10.389
AND ENSURE
ITS SUCCESSION.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.655
THE BLOOD OF
THE FIRST COMMANDER

23:15.698 --> 23:20.224
BECCA PRAMHEDA
IS YOUR BLOOD,

23:20.268 --> 23:23.706
AND I WILL NEVER
LET ANYONE HARM YOU.

23:41.289 --> 23:42.508
[BEEP BEEP BEEP
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP]

23:42.551 --> 23:44.553
INDRA: LET'S
GET THIS OVER WITH.

23:47.861 --> 23:50.646
COOPER: WHAT THE HELL
ARE THEY DOING HERE, INDRA?

23:51.560 --> 23:54.607
YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME?

23:56.086 --> 23:58.045
YOU KNEW
ABOUT THIS.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.786
OF COURSE I KNEW
ABOUT THIS.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.701
IT WAS MY IDEA.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.268
WE'RE UP AGAINST AN ARMY
WITH SUPERIOR FIREPOWER

24:04.312 --> 24:06.140
AND EVERY
GEOGRAPHIC ADVANTAGE.

24:06.183 --> 24:07.794
THIS IS HOW
WE OVERCOME THAT.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.578
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOUR SECRET WEAPON

24:09.622 --> 24:11.885
DESTROYS THE VALLEY
YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR?

24:11.928 --> 24:13.408
I RAN SOME TESTS.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.670
THE WORMS CAN'T SURVIVE
IN A GREEN ENVIRONMENT

24:14.714 --> 24:16.324
FOR MORE THAN
A FEW DAYS,

24:16.367 --> 24:17.586
LONG ENOUGH
TO KILL EVERYONE

24:17.630 --> 24:19.588
THEY COME N CONTACT WITH
BEFORE WE GET THERE.

24:19.632 --> 24:22.461
BELLAMY: ARE WE REALLY
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION?

24:22.504 --> 24:26.595
OUR FRIENDS ARE THERE,
PEOPLE WE LOVE.

24:26.639 --> 24:29.032
ACCEPTABLE LOSSES.

24:30.730 --> 24:34.081
COOPER, CHECK ON THE WORMS.
COME ON, BIG BROTHER.

24:34.124 --> 24:38.302
HOW MANY INNOCENT LIVES
HAVE YOU SACRIFICED,

24:38.346 --> 24:41.523
OR YOU, WANHEDA?

24:41.567 --> 24:43.438
THIS IS NO DIFFERENT.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.396
YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR PEOPLE.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.529
SO AM I.

24:47.573 --> 24:51.228
-YOU KILLED HIM.
-NO. YOU DID.

24:51.272 --> 24:52.795
COOPER?

24:52.839 --> 24:54.623
ONE OF THE DEFECTORS
SURVIVED.

24:54.667 --> 24:57.234
LOOKS LIKE WE FOUND SOMETHING
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

24:57.278 --> 24:58.888
COOPER: BLODREINA...

25:00.847 --> 25:03.502
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU,

25:03.545 --> 25:05.025
BUT THE RESULTS
WERE REMARKABLE.

25:05.068 --> 25:07.462
THE WORMS REPRODUCED 3 TIMES
FASTER IN A LIVE BODY,

25:07.506 --> 25:09.595
AND WE NEED QUANTITY
AS WELL AS CONTROL.

25:09.638 --> 25:12.946
OCTAVIA,
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.774
OCTAVIA: SPARE ME,
YOUR HYPOCRISY, CLARKE.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.689
MILLER TOLD ME
ABOUT THE MAN

25:16.732 --> 25:19.474
THAT YOU IRRADIATED
IN BECCA'S LAB...

25:21.998 --> 25:25.262
AND JUST HOW LONG
DID YOUR TEST SUBJECT SURVIVE?

25:25.306 --> 25:26.655
COOPER: LONG ENOUGH
FOR A DEFECTOR

25:26.699 --> 25:29.092
TO BOARD THEIR SHIP
AND FLY TO THE VALLEY.

25:29.136 --> 25:32.182
BELLAMY:
OCTAVIA, PLEASE,

25:32.226 --> 25:35.403
DON'T DO THIS.

25:35.446 --> 25:39.538
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN
TO YOUR FRIENDS, BELLAMY,

25:39.581 --> 25:44.760
NOT EVEN ECHO--
PLEASE BELIEVE THAT--

25:44.804 --> 25:47.633
BUT THIS IS WAR.

25:47.676 --> 25:51.985
ONCE WE CONTROL THE EYE
IN THE SKY, WE SEND THE WORMS.

25:52.028 --> 25:55.554
COOPER, CHOOSE ONE OF
THE ELITE GUARDS TO DELIVER IT.

25:55.597 --> 25:59.166
IT'S TIME FOR WONKRU
TO GO HOME.

26:02.822 --> 26:03.953
RAVEN: NO WAY.
SHAW'S AN ALLY.

26:03.997 --> 26:06.782
THERE ARE TIMES IN WAR
WHERE YOU HAVE TO DO

26:06.826 --> 26:09.655
THE WRONG THINGS
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

26:09.698 --> 26:12.396
THIS IS ONE
OF THOSE TIMES.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.181
BESIDES,
YOU SAID YOURSELF,

26:14.224 --> 26:15.791
THEY CAN'T KILL HIM

26:15.835 --> 26:17.227
BECAUSE THEY
NEED HIM TO FLY.

26:17.271 --> 26:19.708
WE ARE NOT BETRAYING THE ONE
FRIEND THAT WE HAVE HERE.

26:19.752 --> 26:21.275
HE WILL TAKE ME
TO THE BRIDGE.

26:21.318 --> 26:22.885
I JUST NEED
MORE TIME.

26:22.929 --> 26:24.844
BELLAMY:
LET'S GO OVER THIS AGAIN.

26:24.887 --> 26:27.455
AS SOON AS ECHO AND RAVEN GET
THE EYE DOWN, WE TAKE THE ROVER.

26:27.498 --> 26:29.413
WE DRIVE ACROSS
THE WASTELAND.

26:29.457 --> 26:30.632
WE BREAK OUT
OUR PEOPLE BEFORE

26:30.676 --> 26:31.938
WONKRU ATTACKS
WITH THE WORMS.

26:31.981 --> 26:34.636
OCTAVIA WILL EXPECT US
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.420
SHE'LL POST SENTRIES.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.771
THAT'S TOO BAD
FOR THE SENTRIES.

26:40.816 --> 26:44.037
THIS, THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE JASPER'S SUICIDE NOTE

26:44.080 --> 26:46.822
AFTER WE PULLED HIM
OUT OF THE CITY OF LIGHT.

26:46.866 --> 26:49.216
HE WAS GONNA PUT
A GUN IN HIS MOUTH

26:49.259 --> 26:50.478
AND PULL
THE TRIGGER.

26:50.521 --> 26:51.784
MONTY, NOW'S
NOT THE TIME.

26:51.827 --> 26:53.786
NOW IS THE
PERFECT TIME.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.353
"MONTY, I KNOW
YOU'RE AN OPTIMIST.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.051
"YOU THINK BETTER
DAYS ARE AHEAD,

26:58.094 --> 27:00.227
"BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.403
"THERE IS NO LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

27:02.446 --> 27:04.666
"THERE'S ONLY THE TUNNEL,

27:04.710 --> 27:07.364
"ANOTHER ENEMY TO FIGHT,
ANOTHER WAR.

27:07.408 --> 27:10.846
"I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT WE'RE THE PROBLEM--

27:10.890 --> 27:12.239
"HUMAN BEINGS,
ALL OF US.

27:12.282 --> 27:15.546
"THE CYCLE CAN'T BE BROKEN
AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE.

27:15.590 --> 27:18.375
"THAT'S WHY
I WON'T BE HERE.

27:18.419 --> 27:21.596
THAT'S WHY--"

27:21.640 --> 27:25.252
MONTY...

27:25.295 --> 27:27.907
IT'S OK.

27:27.950 --> 27:30.300
YEAH. JASPER WAS
SMARTER THAN ALL OF US.

27:30.344 --> 27:31.780
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT WE DO.

27:31.824 --> 27:33.826
COMING BACK TO THE GROUND,
OPENING THE BUNKER,

27:33.869 --> 27:35.871
ALL WE'VE DONE
IS MADE THINGS WORSE.

27:35.915 --> 27:37.873
IF A WAR IS THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE
THE LAST SURVIVABLE LAND

27:37.917 --> 27:42.312
ON EARTH, THEN MAYBE
WE DON'T DESERVE IT.

28:13.648 --> 28:16.825
THANKS FOR WAKING ME.
WAIT OUTSIDE.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.701
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT?

28:22.744 --> 28:24.703
YOU SAID YOU
COULDN'T TRUST A SPY.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.748
DOES THAT MEAN, EVEN
IF MY INFORMATION IS GOOD,

28:26.792 --> 28:29.142
IT WON'T HELP ME GET
OUT OF THIS COLLAR?

28:29.185 --> 28:30.796
TRUST CAN BE EARNED.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.623
I'VE BEEN HERE A DAY,
AND ALREADY I KNOW

28:32.667 --> 28:34.974
THERE'S A TRAITOR
IN YOUR CAMP--

28:35.017 --> 28:36.976
YOUR PILOT.

28:37.019 --> 28:39.369
SHAW'S CONSCIENCE
CAN GET IN THE WAY

28:39.413 --> 28:42.198
OF HIS DUTIES,
BUT HAVING

28:42.242 --> 28:44.984
A SOFT SIDE HARDLY
MAKES HIM A TRAITOR.

28:45.027 --> 28:47.595
HOW ABOUT
DISOBEYING ORDERS

28:47.638 --> 28:49.684
OR GIVING COMFORT
TO THE ENEMY?

28:49.728 --> 28:51.817
WHEN HE TOLD YOU
RAVEN LOCKED YOU

28:51.860 --> 28:54.907
OUT OF THE MISSILE SYSTEM,
HE WAS LYING.

28:54.950 --> 28:59.172
HE DID IT HIMSELF,
AND I CAN PROVE IT.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.752
YOU NEED TO SLEEP.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.667
I'LL SLEEP WHEN
THE WAR IS WON.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.974
-YOU KNOW WHY.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.671
NO MORE
LECTURES, INDRA.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.021
I DIDN'T SANCTION
HUMAN TESTING,

29:22.064 --> 29:23.892
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN I WON'T USE

29:23.936 --> 29:25.938
WHAT COOPER LEARNED
TO HELP SAVE MY PEOPLE.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.027
WHAT IF THE WORMS
DESTROY THE VALLEY?

29:28.070 --> 29:30.681
YOU'RE THE HEAD
OF MY ARMY.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.031
GIVE ME
A BETTER IDEA.

29:32.074 --> 29:33.989
AM I THE HEAD
OF YOUR ARMY?

29:34.033 --> 29:35.034
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

29:35.077 --> 29:36.557
WHEN WERE YOU
GOING TO TELL ME

29:36.600 --> 29:38.385
ABOUT THIS
WEAPONS PLAN?

29:38.428 --> 29:39.821
WHEN WERE YOU
GOING TO TELL ME

29:39.865 --> 29:42.824
YOU HELPED
KANE ESCAPE?

29:42.868 --> 29:45.044
IF WE LOSE,
THAT'LL BE WHY.

29:45.087 --> 29:46.393
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

29:46.436 --> 29:49.918
AWFUL, AND
I'D DO IT AGAIN.

29:49.962 --> 29:53.530
NOT IF I THROW YOU
IN THE PIT FIRST.

29:53.574 --> 29:58.666
I WON'T APOLOGIZE FOR
PROTECTING YOU FROM YOURSELF.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.886
GET OUT.

30:02.496 --> 30:05.020
I SAID GO!

30:05.064 --> 30:08.415
MAN: BLODREINA.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.765
NOW.

30:12.506 --> 30:15.030
BE CAREFUL OF
THE DARK, OCTAVIA,

30:15.074 --> 30:18.338
TOO EASY
TO LOSE YOUR WAY.

30:24.997 --> 30:26.389
UH!

30:31.046 --> 30:34.833
ECHO SAYS YOU ACCUSED
MY PILOT OF SABOTAGE,

30:34.876 --> 30:36.835
THAT HE, NOT YOU,

30:36.878 --> 30:39.054
LOCKED ME OUT OF
MY MISSILE SYSTEM.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.535
TELL THE COLONEL
WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

30:41.578 --> 30:45.147
NO MORE WORDS.
I NEED PROOF.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.369
SHOW HER.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.899
OK.

31:14.002 --> 31:16.135
FIRST, I HAVE TO ACCESS
THE BACKLOGS

31:16.178 --> 31:17.745
FOR THE MISSILE SYSTEMS.

31:17.788 --> 31:21.923
LOGS CAN BE TAMPERED WITH
ON THE SURFACE.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.447
SEE? RIGHT HERE.

31:24.491 --> 31:25.971
THE FIRST LAYER TELLS YOU

31:26.014 --> 31:28.016
THAT THE SYSTEM WAS
SHUT DOWN MANUALLY.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.105
DIYOZA: BUT IT DOESN'T
SAY WHO DID IT.

31:30.149 --> 31:32.194
HOW DO I KNOW
IT WASN'T YOU?

31:32.238 --> 31:33.935
GETTING THERE.

31:33.979 --> 31:37.808
HE COVERED HIS TRACKS,
BUT IF YOU LOOK DEEP ENOUGH,

31:37.852 --> 31:40.986
THERE'S ALWAYS
A TRAIL.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.204
JUST WATCH.

31:42.248 --> 31:45.468
IT'S BURIED UNDER LAYERS
OF ROTE OBJECT CODE.

31:57.828 --> 32:02.050
SEE? THERE IT IS,
THE GHOST TRAIL.

32:12.017 --> 32:15.324
CLARKE: BELLAMY,
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

32:20.416 --> 32:23.376
WE'RE IN.
ECHO DID IT.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.813
OK.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.119
WAIT, BELLAMY.

32:27.162 --> 32:29.512
AS SOON AS WE TELL HER,
SHE MARCHES TO WAR

32:29.556 --> 32:31.123
AND UNLEASHES
THOSE WORMS.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.081
THAT'S WHY WE GOT
TO GET THERE FIRST.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.909
WE TAKE THE ROVER.
WE GET OUR PEOPLE OUT.

32:34.953 --> 32:39.087
THEN WE WORRY ABOUT
STOPPING THE WAR, OK?

32:39.131 --> 32:40.828
GOOD. I'LL GET
MONTY AND HARPER.

32:40.871 --> 32:43.787
YOU GET MADI.
WE LEAVE TONIGHT.

32:54.885 --> 32:56.409
BELLAMY: MONTY, COME ON.
ECHO GOT IT DONE.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.541
TIME TO PROGRAM
THE LOOP SO WE CAN GO.

32:58.585 --> 33:01.457
NO.

33:01.501 --> 33:05.331
WHAT?

33:09.900 --> 33:12.120
I MISS HIM, TOO.

33:14.166 --> 33:17.169
JASPER SHOULD HAVE BEEN
WITH US ON THE RING,

33:17.212 --> 33:20.041
BUT HE WASN'T
BECAUSE HE GAVE UP,

33:20.085 --> 33:22.261
AND IF HE HUNG ON
A LITTLE LONGER AND--

33:22.304 --> 33:24.959
AND WHAT?
WE'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.222
DOING WHAT,
SAVING OUR FRIENDS?

33:27.266 --> 33:29.703
WE SAVE OUR FRIENDS
BY STOPPING THIS WAR,

33:29.746 --> 33:31.270
NOT BY
FACILITATING IT.

33:31.313 --> 33:34.360
YEAH. THAT SOUNDS GREAT,
BUT UNLESS YOU HAVE AN IDEA--

33:34.403 --> 33:37.145
WHAT?

33:37.189 --> 33:41.932
"MAKE ALGAE, NOT WAR."
THAT'S CUTE.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.717
WONKRU'S ABOUT TO FIGHT
FOR THAT VALLEY

33:43.760 --> 33:45.632
BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK
THEY CAN SURVIVE HERE,

33:45.675 --> 33:47.938
BUT WITH THIS,
THEY CAN.

33:47.982 --> 33:49.810
YEAH, IF THE EARLY
BATCHES DON'T KILL THEM

33:49.853 --> 33:51.116
LIKE THEY
NEARLY DID US.

33:51.159 --> 33:53.770
THAT'S BEFORE I GOT
THE RECIPE RIGHT,

33:53.814 --> 33:55.859
AND YOU KNOW IT.

33:55.903 --> 33:58.079
LOOK. I'M SORRY, OK?
IT IS A GOOD IDEA.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.212
I KNOW YOU WANTED
TO AVOID ALL THIS.

34:00.255 --> 34:03.041
BUT OUR FRIENDS
COME FIRST?

34:03.084 --> 34:04.477
YEAH.

34:09.264 --> 34:12.267
GOD, I MISS SPACE.

34:14.661 --> 34:16.793
YEP.

34:16.837 --> 34:19.405
COME ON.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.115
ABBY: I'M SORRY.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.334
I'M STILL LOOKING FOR A CURE,
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

34:35.377 --> 34:37.640
THIS MIGHT HELP
WITH THE PAIN.

34:39.729 --> 34:41.427
YEAH.

34:45.735 --> 34:48.651
KANE: I, UM--

34:48.695 --> 34:51.219
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

34:52.394 --> 34:54.309
DOES THAT MEAN
THAT YOU BELIEVE

34:54.353 --> 34:57.312
I DID ALL I COULD
TO SAVE THAT GIRL?

34:57.356 --> 35:00.576
UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES, YES.

35:02.622 --> 35:05.277
ABBY...

35:07.931 --> 35:10.412
I LOVE YOU,

35:10.456 --> 35:13.285
AND--AND I WANT
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU

35:13.328 --> 35:15.461
THROUGH DETOX.

35:15.504 --> 35:19.726
I--I'D WALK
THROUGH FIRE FOR YOU.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.468
I'D DIE FOR YOU,

35:22.511 --> 35:25.471
BUT I WON'T WATCH
YOU KILL YOURSELF,

35:25.514 --> 35:27.342
NOT ANYMORE...

35:29.823 --> 35:31.868
SO WE NEED
TO CHOOSE--

35:31.912 --> 35:35.089
ME OR THE PILLS.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.265
MARCUS, I--

35:39.876 --> 35:42.836
PLEASE,

35:42.879 --> 35:45.317
I NEED FOR YOU
TO TRUST ME.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.101
I AM MAKING HEADWAY
ON A CURE,

35:47.145 --> 35:49.190
-AND AS SOON AS I DO--
-CHOOSE.

35:57.459 --> 35:59.766
I COULD COME BACK.

36:05.424 --> 36:07.817
I'LL LEAVE YOU
TO IT, THEN.

36:13.345 --> 36:16.304
TAKE A SEAT.
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

36:22.005 --> 36:25.531
ANYTHING GOOD
TO REPORT, DOC?

36:25.574 --> 36:27.315
GOOD?

36:29.012 --> 36:30.927
75% OF YOUR PEOPLE
ARE DYING.

36:30.971 --> 36:33.582
THAT'S GOOD...

36:35.236 --> 36:38.935
FOR OCTAVIA.

36:38.979 --> 36:40.633
I'M STILL WORKING
ON A TREATMENT,

36:40.676 --> 36:42.765
BUT WITH YOUR
ANTIQUATED EQUIPMENT,

36:42.809 --> 36:44.419
YOU'RE BASICALLY
SCREWED.

36:44.463 --> 36:47.248
IS THAT YOUR
PROFESSIONAL DIAGNOSIS?

36:47.292 --> 36:50.425
SO AM I RIGHT
IN ASSUMING THAT YOU

36:50.469 --> 36:52.340
HAVEN'T COME TO GET
TESTED BEFORE NOW

36:52.384 --> 36:55.822
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY
HAVING SYMPTOMS?

36:55.865 --> 36:58.564
SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, YEAH.

OCTAVIA: I NEED TO BORROW HER
FOR A STRATEGY SESSION.

40:32.647 --> 40:35.694
YOU DON'T MIND,
DO YOU, CLARKE?

40:35.737 --> 40:38.653
NO.

40:38.697 --> 40:42.440
IT'S FINE.

WE HAVE
TO LEAVE NOW.

REALIZES WHAT ECHO DID,

40:58.586 --> 40:59.892
SHE'S DEAD.

40:59.935 --> 41:04.070
-WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
-YOU'RE WRONG. WE HAVE ONE.

41:05.637 --> 41:07.595
WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:07.639 --> 41:09.684
STOPPING THE CYCLE.

41:17.300 --> 41:20.478
THIS IS CLARKE GRIFFIN.

41:20.521 --> 41:23.132
I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR COLONEL DIYOZA.

41:23.176 --> 41:26.396
DIYOZA, ON RADIO: HELLO, CLARKE.
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.137
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT?

41:28.181 --> 41:30.836
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU
TO SHARE THE VALLEY?

41:30.879 --> 41:34.143
DIYOZA: SHARE IT?
WELL, LET ME SEE.

41:34.187 --> 41:38.060
SHORT OF AN UNCONDITIONAL
SURRENDER, NOTHING.

41:38.104 --> 41:39.714
OCTAVIA WILL
NEVER SURRENDER.

41:42.717 --> 41:45.067
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
GONNA TAKE HER OUT.
