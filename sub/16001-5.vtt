[Brian] Previously on
What About Brian:

00:02.667 --> 00:04.917
- I had fun last night.
- Yeah, I did, too.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.917
We start with
ovulation induction.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.250
If this is the way it
has to be, I don't want
to have a baby at all.

00:10.333 --> 00:13.834
- Been thinking about
the open marriage?
- Sure have.

00:13.917 --> 00:15.959
- Dave.
- Suzanne.

00:16.041 --> 00:18.458
- What are you doing here?
- I was doing errands.

00:18.542 --> 00:19.834
Come in?

00:19.917 --> 00:22.291
I saw Brian.
Where's he been all day?

00:22.375 --> 00:25.542
With me. We had
a hard time getting
out of the house.

00:25.625 --> 00:29.333
Brian, it's Marjorie.
When I see you with
someone like Lisa B.,

00:29.417 --> 00:32.792
it's just hard not
to wonder "What if?"

00:34.792 --> 00:37.709
- Richard, right?
- Yeah. Sorry we're late.
There was...

00:41.000 --> 00:42.041
That guy?

00:48.667 --> 00:50.750
OK, no putting
in the house, please.

00:50.834 --> 00:54.375
Ah! Ah! Lethal weapon.
Hand it over. Thank you.

00:54.458 --> 00:58.291
Hey, maybe Maria will
take you and your sister
miniature golfing today.

00:58.375 --> 01:02.291
- [Larissa] Yay!
I love miniature golf.
- Maria's coming today?

01:02.375 --> 01:05.625
- Yeah, I got stuff to do.
- What kind of stuff?

01:05.709 --> 01:07.542
Uh, I got a haircut
at eleven.

01:07.625 --> 01:10.250
Uh, yoga, the cleaners.
Just, you know, stuff.

01:10.333 --> 01:12.375
Yeah. Girls
can't come with you?

01:12.458 --> 01:15.959
I make these appointments
on weekends 'cause
you watch the girls,

01:16.041 --> 01:18.792
but you're going golfing,
so I just got the sitter.

01:18.875 --> 01:20.709
Right. Right.

01:22.417 --> 01:26.166
What's up with you?
You've been weird
all morning.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.875
Really?
Noticeably weird?

01:28.959 --> 01:32.250
How would you rate my weirdness
on a scale of one to ten, Deena?

01:40.458 --> 01:42.750
Why are you taking
your computer with you?

01:44.834 --> 01:47.542
Because I have to show
Brian something.

01:50.083 --> 01:52.375
- [Adam] Feet straight.
- [Marjorie] I can do it.

01:52.458 --> 01:54.792
I just aim and tap it.

01:56.458 --> 01:58.709
[both laugh]

01:58.792 --> 02:02.500
- You gotta learn
to read the green.
- I'm a doctor. Golf is cliché.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.875
- Tennis?
- [Adam] Golf is never cliché.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.542
Angelo, take off that hat.
I'm not playing golf
with you in that hat.

02:08.625 --> 02:13.458
At least I can take
my hat off. Your hair,
you're stuck with that.

02:13.542 --> 02:16.792
Here, show her how to putt, Bri.
I gotta get my clubs.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.375
Hey, do you and Lisa
wanna come over tonight?

02:19.458 --> 02:22.291
- Honey, I can't tonight.
I'm on call.
- No, she's not.

02:22.375 --> 02:25.291
- She just
doesn't like Lisa.
- Adam.

02:26.583 --> 02:29.709
I am on call. And I don't
dislike Lisa. I like her.

02:29.792 --> 02:31.500
- We all like her.
- I know.

02:31.583 --> 02:33.709
I heard your message
last night.

02:33.792 --> 02:35.166
[car horn]

02:35.250 --> 02:38.083
There's Dave.

02:38.166 --> 02:40.208
- Nicole is coming by later.
- What for?

02:40.291 --> 02:42.583
Uh, she has wedding ideas
for you. Ciao.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.166
- Bye.
- Let's go.

02:45.792 --> 02:49.750
Lisa heard your message,
too. The "What if?"
didn't go over too well.

02:49.834 --> 02:52.000
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

02:54.166 --> 02:56.208
I'm sorry.

02:56.291 --> 03:01.000
I keep trying to make things
right and then I just go
and mess it up.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.834
Marjorie,
I like this girl.

03:03.917 --> 03:08.417
She's at my apartment now,
working on her clothes,
waiting for me to get home.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.667
And for the first time ever,
I wanna get home.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.458
I want this to work,

03:14.542 --> 03:16.750
and I need you to help me
make it work, OK?

03:16.834 --> 03:18.583
[car horn]

03:18.667 --> 03:20.834
- OK.
- OK.

03:20.917 --> 03:23.250
[♪♪]

03:26.667 --> 03:29.542
- Bye, honey.
- [Marjorie] Bye. Have fun.

03:36.834 --> 03:39.125
Come on, Nancy.
Can't you drive any faster?

03:39.208 --> 03:41.375
I don't think this thing
goes any faster.

03:41.458 --> 03:43.458
[sighing]
Tee time's at ten

03:43.542 --> 03:47.125
and Brian's gotta do
his little girlie
stretch routine.

03:47.208 --> 03:49.041
- You're going down.
- Yeah.

03:49.125 --> 03:50.792
Where are
the breakfast burritos?

03:50.875 --> 03:52.875
I ordered
two beans and cheeses.

03:52.959 --> 03:55.375
- Please learn
how to say it correctly.
- I am.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.667
- No, you're not.
- Beans and cheeses.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.500
- Where's the bag?
- He forgot them.

03:59.583 --> 04:03.291
Don't joke about Juanita's
burritos. You know I take
this seriously.

04:03.375 --> 04:08.291
- So, no beans and cheeses?
- It's bean and cheese.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.333
- That's what I said.
- No, it isn't.

04:10.417 --> 04:13.250
The time Juanita
moved her truck,
we couldn't find her,

04:13.333 --> 04:14.750
it was like losing a parent.

04:14.834 --> 04:16.667
- Doesn't have them.
- How could you?

04:16.750 --> 04:18.834
That's your most
important job.

04:18.917 --> 04:22.917
No burritos, it's worse
than being seen with Angelo
with that stupid hat.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.583
- It's my lucky hat.
- Yeah, how lucky
could it be?

04:25.667 --> 04:28.542
- Dave forgot the burritos.
- Enough with the burritos.

04:28.625 --> 04:32.542
Life goes on without
the burritos, OK? They're
not even that good, anyway.

04:32.625 --> 04:36.291
They're filled with lard
and egg product and
Juanita's special sauce.

04:36.375 --> 04:39.542
I don't know what's in it,
do you? Does anybody?

04:39.625 --> 04:42.250
Huh? Has anybody taken
a good look at Juanita?

04:42.333 --> 04:44.458
I mean, taken
a real good look at her?

04:50.083 --> 04:53.959
- [Adam] What are you
doing, Dave?
- Whoa. What's up, dude?

04:55.750 --> 04:57.792
- I think Deena's doing it.
- Doing what?

04:59.125 --> 05:01.166
I think she's sleeping
with another guy.

05:14.041 --> 05:16.417
[girls chattering]

05:21.125 --> 05:23.291
[Dave] So I'm filming
Larissa's birthday party.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.959
Happy, happy, happy.
Just watch.

05:30.375 --> 05:33.500
Looks like a normal
conversation, right?

05:33.583 --> 05:36.500
OK, right there.
He pushes her.
What the hell's that?

05:37.750 --> 05:39.625
All right, watch this.

05:41.333 --> 05:45.041
All right, now, see,
right there, behind the glass.

05:45.125 --> 05:47.458
You see that?
They're fighting.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.417
I don't know. Guys,
am I being paranoid here?
What do you think?

05:56.166 --> 05:59.083
That is the worst
dinosaur performance
I've ever seen.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.417
- Angelo.
- What?

06:01.500 --> 06:05.083
What? He's worried about Deena
fighting with this other guy?

06:05.166 --> 06:08.500
- It could be anything.
- Not if you're having
an open marriage.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.875
- You're having
an open marriage?
- Yeah, we talked about it, OK?

06:13.959 --> 06:16.625
That's all. It got us going,
but we never...

06:18.375 --> 06:22.709
We know this guy, OK?
His daughter is
Larissa's best friend.

06:22.792 --> 06:25.959
- They were fighting
about the girls.
- Come on, they're five.

06:26.041 --> 06:29.834
In Italy, perfect strangers
fight like this
for a parking space.

06:29.917 --> 06:32.333
In America, people don't
get into it unless...

06:32.417 --> 06:33.667
What?

06:34.750 --> 06:36.625
What? Whatever it is,
just say it.

06:36.709 --> 06:39.875
Unless there's something
sexual going on.

06:41.208 --> 06:43.542
That's what you're thinking,
right, Dave?

06:43.625 --> 06:46.709
That because of this fight,
something sexual's going on?

06:49.041 --> 06:53.125
Thank you for supporting
the Los Angeles County
Ranger Girls. Twelve dollars.

06:53.208 --> 06:55.542
- Yeah, OK. No, thanks.
- You're wrong, Adam.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.542
It's not sexual. Sorry.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.834
Do you fight
with the cable guy
like that? Your boss?

07:00.917 --> 07:04.291
Nicole has been arguing
a lot lately.
It's kind of scary.

07:04.375 --> 07:05.375
[knocking]

07:05.458 --> 07:06.792
Don't you want to support

07:06.875 --> 07:08.959
the Los Angeles County
Ranger Girls?

07:09.041 --> 07:13.709
Here, I'll tell you what.
I am gonna give you...
Let's see.

07:13.792 --> 07:17.208
I've got five dollars, OK?
You know when your daddy's
in a bad mood,

07:17.291 --> 07:19.166
you have to stay away
from him all day?

07:19.250 --> 07:22.166
That's what's going on here.
Take the five dollars and go.

07:22.250 --> 07:25.875
Just go. Just go now.

07:25.959 --> 07:30.667
Marjorie and I fight sometimes,
but only because we're
so hot for each other.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.542
Nine times out of ten
we end up in the sack
afterwards.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.250
- That's the best kind
of sex anyway.
- Not helping.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.667
It's twelve dollars
for the wash.

07:42.750 --> 07:46.625
We're raising money to buy
a motorized wheelchair
for one of our members.

07:46.709 --> 07:49.041
- Who has a spinal cord injury.
- Not that guy.

07:49.125 --> 07:52.875
I see that guy all the time
when I'm dropping off the kids.

07:52.959 --> 07:54.750
Jerk!

07:54.834 --> 07:56.500
[knocking]

08:04.125 --> 08:06.333
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:06.417 --> 08:10.542
Larissa just... She left her
sweater over at the house,
so I got in my car.

08:10.625 --> 08:13.917
- I thought I would stop by.
- Dave's not home.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.875
- You can't come to my house.
- I've been trying to call.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.959
I wanna apologize.

08:21.959 --> 08:25.000
Can I just...
Can I just come in?
Just for a minute?

08:28.250 --> 08:31.375
[Richard] I thought you guys
agreed to open marriage.

08:31.458 --> 08:34.834
Well, we did. It's just
that Dave and I said we
wouldn't tell each other.

08:36.375 --> 08:41.750
But then to have you
here, in our home,
it made me see...

08:41.834 --> 08:43.834
I know.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.125
I brought you something.

08:49.208 --> 08:52.375
- Oh, Richard.
- Just let me...
Let me give it to you.

08:52.458 --> 08:56.792
And you can... You can...
take it and throw it
in the trash if you want.

08:56.875 --> 08:59.083
It's... It's nothing.

08:59.166 --> 09:02.709
It's... nothing.
It's me saying I'm sorry.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.041
It's...

09:07.208 --> 09:08.542
Oh.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.625
It's something.

09:12.709 --> 09:16.500
They were selling 'em
at school, so if anybody
asks you where you got it,

09:16.583 --> 09:19.125
you can just say that,
you know, you donated money

09:19.208 --> 09:22.542
to the new gym or something,
I don't know.

09:22.625 --> 09:25.125
It's a wish necklace.

09:25.208 --> 09:28.792
You're supposed to wear it
until this little string breaks.

09:28.875 --> 09:32.458
And then, when it breaks,
your wish comes true.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.792
Am I gonna see you again?

09:37.875 --> 09:40.625
[♪♪]

09:48.542 --> 09:50.083
- [knocking]
- [dog barks]

09:50.166 --> 09:52.083
Um...

09:52.166 --> 09:53.667
Coming.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.166
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.667
- Uh, Brian's not here.
- No, I know.

10:08.750 --> 10:11.166
I came by to see you,
actually.

10:11.250 --> 10:15.250
- Brian said that
you'd be here working.
- Yeah. Come on in.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.792
Are these your clothes?
These are really great.

10:28.875 --> 10:30.959
Thanks.

10:31.458 --> 10:34.583
Uh...

10:34.667 --> 10:38.375
The reason I came by is
I just wanted to tell you
that I know what it's like

10:38.458 --> 10:42.709
to come into this group
that's really close-knit
and be the new girlfriend.

10:42.792 --> 10:45.291
That's how I was
with Adam and I just...

10:46.917 --> 10:48.625
I hope that
we can be friends.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.875
Well, sometimes it seems
like you wanna be more
than friends... with Brian.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.959
Well, I don't. We're
like brother and sister.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.792
Yeah, you know,
I have a brother

11:02.875 --> 11:06.333
and I never left him
a message saying, "What if?"

11:07.709 --> 11:10.417
That was a mistake.
We're just friends.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.166
I see.

11:16.333 --> 11:20.166
OK. Well, um...
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come.

11:20.250 --> 11:24.458
You know, come by the shop.
I'll give you a discount.

11:31.917 --> 11:35.041
[announcer]
On the first tee,
Zickerman...

11:35.125 --> 11:37.750
Why'd we send Angelo?
He can barely
speak English.

11:37.834 --> 11:39.875
My friend is very sick.
Sorry.

11:39.959 --> 11:41.250
Maybe they'll take
pity on him.

11:41.333 --> 11:44.291
Come on, Angelo.
Make this happen.

11:44.375 --> 11:47.834
He gonna pretend they don't
have clocks in Italy?
We missed tee time.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.125
He can say our plane
was delayed.

11:50.208 --> 11:54.959
Yeah, we flew in from Rome
to play on a public course
in Griffith Park.

11:55.041 --> 11:57.417
- I'll go see what's up.
- I can't believe this.

11:57.500 --> 12:00.667
- I know. It's a disaster.
- I'm not talking
about our tee time.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.625
- I'm talking
about my marriage.
- Your open marriage.

12:03.709 --> 12:06.500
Deena wasn't supposed
to screw someone
that we know.

12:06.583 --> 12:08.291
Was that one of the rules?

12:08.375 --> 12:10.792
- I don't remember.
- How can you not remember?

12:10.875 --> 12:14.667
She told me to find a girl
to have sex with. I stopped
listening after that.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.875
- Not gonna happen.
- I don't understand.

12:16.959 --> 12:19.291
- No tee times for
the rest of the day.
- Damn it.

12:19.375 --> 12:22.291
What is wrong in America?
Why all these rules?

12:22.375 --> 12:26.041
We just want to play
and they stop us.
It's a game, for relaxing.

12:26.125 --> 12:27.959
OK. That's OK.
We can fix this.

12:28.041 --> 12:30.667
- Where else can we play?
- Par three at Rancho Park.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.166
Par three is like having sex
with the ugly girl

12:33.250 --> 12:35.000
because she's
the only one there.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.500
- I don't wanna play golf.
- You don't wanna play?

12:37.583 --> 12:39.542
- No, I told you.
- Come on, Dave.

12:39.625 --> 12:42.291
- I don't wanna play.
- What do you wanna do?

12:43.750 --> 12:46.125
[♪♪]

12:50.333 --> 12:52.959
OK, she did say that
her haircut was at eleven.

12:59.458 --> 13:02.583
She didn't say anything
about going to a market.
That's odd.

13:02.667 --> 13:05.166
Dave, maybe
she's buying gum.
You're losin' it.

13:05.250 --> 13:09.500
- Gum? Now she wants
fresh breath?
- Maybe she's buying rubbers.

13:09.583 --> 13:12.125
- What?
- There goes golf.
He killed it forever.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.792
- Hey, dumb-ass,
this is his wife here.
- Yeah, I call it like I see it.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.375
What the hell's that?

13:19.458 --> 13:23.250
- It's definitely not rubbers.
- A bottle of champagne.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.792
Maybe the rubbers are
in the bottom of the bag.

13:26.333 --> 13:27.458
Ow!

13:31.625 --> 13:34.709
- She's got such a nice tush.
- Tush?

13:34.792 --> 13:37.291
Why don't I ever tell her
she's got a nice tush?

13:37.375 --> 13:40.083
- She's got
a nice rack, too.
- OK.

14:00.375 --> 14:04.750
Let that be a lesson, boys.
Don't forget to tell your
wives they have nice asses.

14:04.834 --> 14:07.417
I like Nicole's boobs best.
They're so perky.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.834
- Please. I'm begging you.
- What? Your sister
has nice boobs.

14:13.250 --> 14:17.542
Lisa B. has a great stomach.
So smooth, with
this little curve.

14:20.834 --> 14:23.250
- What?
- Just waiting for
the "but," you know?

14:23.333 --> 14:27.250
Lisa B. has a great stomach,
but her hips are too wide,

14:27.333 --> 14:30.083
her legs are stubby,
her nose has an enlarged pore.

14:30.166 --> 14:32.959
- There is no "but."
- I think she has
a great butt.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.875
Except she drinks
her cereal milk,
gulps it right down.

14:37.959 --> 14:41.625
What is wrong with that?
You know, it just
doesn't go to waste.

14:41.709 --> 14:46.417
It's warm, with bits floating
in it. You wanna drink milk,
get a clean glass.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.875
You think Deena wanted
an open marriage

14:49.959 --> 14:51.959
or just to have
sex with that guy?

14:52.041 --> 14:53.959
Because there's
a big difference.

14:54.041 --> 14:55.750
One is a random adventure.

14:55.834 --> 14:58.875
The other is,
"I wanna screw
Richard the Park Guy."

14:58.959 --> 15:01.291
- Dave, we have
to call this off.
- Why?

15:01.375 --> 15:05.458
Whether you like it or not,
she thinks you said OK
to having an open marriage.

15:05.542 --> 15:07.333
If you did,
you made a big mistake.

15:07.417 --> 15:10.458
Stop acting like a betrayed
husband following her around.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.709
- Talk to her tonight, ask her.
- You think I made
a big mistake?

15:13.792 --> 15:16.542
- Obviously.
- You think I made
a mistake?

15:16.625 --> 15:19.917
If somebody touched
Marjorie, I'd kill him.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.917
Well, that's just great.
Well, I guess I'm
the new Karl Cosgrove.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.625
- Who the hell is Karl Cosgrove?
- Karl Cosgrove.

15:26.709 --> 15:30.500
Married to Jill Cosgrove.
Jill had affairs with
the Peruvian gardener,

15:30.583 --> 15:33.542
her sister's boyfriend
and Garrett
from the body shop.

15:33.625 --> 15:36.291
Last I heard,
he's living in Reseda.

15:37.208 --> 15:38.625
Brian, Reseda.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.709
Dave, you're not gonna
make this light here.

15:43.792 --> 15:46.709
I gave permission to my wife
to screw Richard the Park Guy!

15:46.792 --> 15:48.041
Dave, Dave, Dave. Hey!

15:48.125 --> 15:51.000
- [horns honking]
- Whoa, Dave!

15:56.959 --> 15:59.375
What did you do?
Rob a wedding dress store?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.750
Sort of. We shot
Courtney Love's album
cover the other day.

16:02.834 --> 16:05.959
She wanted to look
like the girl in
the White Wedding video.

16:07.083 --> 16:08.959
Try this on.
You'll look so hot.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.875
Oh.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.959
Oh, God.

16:15.792 --> 16:21.125
Adam's mom would die.
I mean, she would literally
stop breathing.

16:21.208 --> 16:25.166
That's what we're going
for, expiration of the
mother-in-law. Get naked.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.792
[Angelo] Does she
always drive like this?

16:32.875 --> 16:34.917
I don't know.
I've never tailed her.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
- Guys.
- [Brian] She's going right.

16:38.083 --> 16:40.917
- [Adam] Where's she going?
- [Dave] I know
where she's going.

16:42.375 --> 16:45.959
- Dave.
- Great. Their little
secret love nest.

16:46.041 --> 16:49.750
Probably belongs to some
friend who's out of town.
Jacuzzi, waterbed.

16:49.834 --> 16:52.083
I'm trying to tell you.
This is my house.

16:59.125 --> 17:01.750
- Mystery solved.
Let's play golf.
- Yes.

17:01.834 --> 17:03.500
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Why?

17:03.583 --> 17:05.917
She's not having an affair
with Marjorie.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.750
Mmm, let's all savor that image
in our minds for a moment.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.750
She lied to me.

17:10.834 --> 17:15.000
She didn't say a word
about going to Marjorie's,
OK? I'm not moving.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.208
I've gotta get out.
I'm starving.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.375
Why don't you go
to that burger joint?

17:24.458 --> 17:27.792
- Your car's right there.
- Can't I go inside
and make a sandwich?

17:27.875 --> 17:32.875
Yeah, tell Deena we're
outside having a stakeout,
but we got the munchies.

17:32.959 --> 17:34.834
If I turn my car on,
they'll hear it.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.625
You're a car guy.
Figure it out.

17:36.709 --> 17:37.875
Yeah, car guy.

17:39.709 --> 17:42.458
- Come on, Angelo.
- All right.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.875
- Come on.
Don't let them see you.
- I know, I know.

17:51.959 --> 17:54.000
[Brian] On three.
One, two three.

17:54.083 --> 17:55.542
[Angelo] My hat!

17:58.542 --> 18:00.959
Why are you staying here?

18:01.041 --> 18:04.083
- 'Cause I'm worried
about you.
- [Brian] Push the car.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.750
- [Brian] You push the car.
I'll drive.
- [Angelo] OK.

18:07.792 --> 18:09.792
You think it's true, then?

18:09.875 --> 18:13.667
I don't know, dude.
I hope not.

18:13.750 --> 18:16.125
[Angelo]
Take off the brake.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.542
[Brian] Go.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.625
[Angelo]
Right, right, right.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.208
[starts engine]

18:26.875 --> 18:28.458
Idiots.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.625
Well, I can't stay long,
but I brought some champagne.

18:35.709 --> 18:39.083
This looks way better
on you than it did
on Courtney Love, trust me.

18:39.166 --> 18:42.417
- Thanks.
- Wow, look at you.
You're gorgeous.

18:44.208 --> 18:48.583
It's $7,000.
I don't care, though.
I could sell an organ.

18:48.667 --> 18:51.792
- Champagne, Nic?
- No, better not.

18:53.458 --> 18:56.208
Oh, my God.

18:56.291 --> 18:59.792
- Are you guys trying again?
- Well, not officially.

18:59.875 --> 19:01.792
- They're trying.
- They're trying.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.500
Not we. Me.

19:04.583 --> 19:07.625
- I'm trying.
- What do you mean?

19:07.709 --> 19:12.166
I'm doing ovulation
induction. I'm just
not telling Angelo.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.625
[Deena] Um...

19:17.959 --> 19:19.834
I don't understand.

19:19.917 --> 19:23.500
He keeps saying he wants
to do things naturally or
not at all, and I know him.

19:23.583 --> 19:27.208
He's gonna regret
this someday, so I'm just
helping nature along.

19:41.667 --> 19:45.500
[Angelo] I love these places.
Nicole will never go
to a burger joint.

19:45.583 --> 19:48.041
Nitrates in the beef,
grease in the arteries.

19:48.125 --> 19:50.250
Spores in the ozone.
She tells you, too?

19:50.333 --> 19:52.750
She tells me everything.

19:52.834 --> 19:55.166
So what do you think
they put in the fish melt?

19:55.250 --> 19:57.333
She told me you don't
wanna have kids.

19:57.959 --> 19:59.709
[Angelo sighs]

19:59.792 --> 20:03.083
Angelo, when you first
got married and Nicole
was pregnant,

20:03.166 --> 20:06.458
you were so excited
to become parents.

20:06.542 --> 20:08.875
We were excited.
Of course we were excited.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
But... we lost her.

20:13.959 --> 20:15.959
We lost her.

20:16.041 --> 20:20.125
I didn't even know
this little girl
and already I loved her.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.166
- You can try again.
- And fail?

20:22.250 --> 20:24.291
Or not.

20:24.375 --> 20:28.125
- Anything's possible.
- Everyone needs
to stop saying that.

20:28.208 --> 20:31.834
It hurts Nicole.
What if she gets pregnant
and we lose another baby?

20:31.917 --> 20:33.917
How many times
before we say enough?

20:36.667 --> 20:39.041
Everything
is not possible.

20:39.125 --> 20:43.834
You know, I don't
want to be sad about
what I don't have.

20:43.917 --> 20:46.041
I want to be happy
with what I do.

20:46.125 --> 20:49.166
I have a wonderful wife,
great friends.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.917
Life is good.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.750
Life is good.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.333
One fish melt, please.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.083
You have to be completely
honest about everything
or there's no trust.

21:11.166 --> 21:15.333
So you tell Adam everything,
even if you have fantasies
about another guy?

21:15.417 --> 21:17.834
- I don't have any fantasies.
- Come on, Marjorie.

21:17.917 --> 21:19.917
Stop being such
a goody two-shoes.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.583
Who is Goody Two-Shoes,
anyway?

21:21.667 --> 21:24.000
I don't know,
but I wanna kick her ass.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.500
[cell phone ringing]

21:25.583 --> 21:27.917
OK, let's try
another one of these on.

21:30.166 --> 21:34.667
I call... this one.

21:34.750 --> 21:37.875
Oh, guys, I gotta go.

21:37.959 --> 21:40.750
Why? You look so cute.
Reminds me of your
wedding day.

21:40.834 --> 21:42.834
You were so pretty
and happy.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.083
Uh...

21:45.166 --> 21:47.458
Oh, I think I'm stuck.

21:47.542 --> 21:50.542
Well, come on, help me.
I think it's caught
on my necklace.

21:50.625 --> 21:53.041
- OK.
- Be careful, please.
Don't break it.

21:53.125 --> 21:55.667
- I just got it.
I don't wanna break it.
- OK, OK, OK.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.834
Thank you.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.208
Look.
That is so sweet.

22:01.291 --> 22:03.250
- Did Dave give it to you?
- No.

22:03.333 --> 22:05.959
It's not from Dave,
actually.

22:06.041 --> 22:08.834
- Who's it from?
- No one.

22:13.208 --> 22:17.000
- Someone.
- What? Spill it.

22:19.333 --> 22:22.417
Um, all right.
Dave and I are kind of...

22:22.500 --> 22:25.000
...doing this thing.

22:25.083 --> 22:27.583
What kind of thing?

22:27.667 --> 22:30.750
I don't know.
An... experiment.

22:30.834 --> 22:34.041
Kind of an open marriage.

22:36.875 --> 22:38.959
You might call it.

22:41.417 --> 22:42.709
An open marriage?

22:44.333 --> 22:47.000
- Well, it's not a big deal.
- Are you kidding?

22:47.083 --> 22:48.834
You guys have such
a great thing.

22:48.917 --> 22:50.917
Well, it's not
about that, sweetie.

22:52.625 --> 22:54.625
I need to sit down.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.041
Wow.

22:58.291 --> 22:59.834
Wow, Deena.

23:00.709 --> 23:02.250
Have you slept with him?

23:04.667 --> 23:07.542
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.792
[cell phone ringing]

23:23.000 --> 23:25.542
- Is that him?
- Yes.

23:25.625 --> 23:29.583
- Does Dave know?
- No. We're not telling.

23:33.875 --> 23:38.208
- I don't know what to say.
- It isn't anything.
It's just sex.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.333
- He gave you a necklace.
- So?

23:40.417 --> 23:43.417
So, you sleep with him,
he gives you presents.

23:44.291 --> 23:46.667
You're having an affair.

23:46.750 --> 23:51.625
You know what?
You guys have no idea.
You just have no idea.

23:51.709 --> 23:56.000
I mean, when you have been
married for so long and
you think to yourself,

23:56.083 --> 23:59.166
"Am I gonna die
without ever
experiencing, you know,

23:59.250 --> 24:03.083
the euphoria of another man
discovering me and...?"

24:04.625 --> 24:07.125
I think Dave really
feels the same way, too.

24:07.208 --> 24:09.667
- Do you want Dave
to find out?
- No, I don't.

24:09.750 --> 24:12.250
'Cause it'll break
his heart.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.667
Deena, you might think
you can do this thing,

24:14.750 --> 24:17.750
but your marriage
will never be the same.

24:19.834 --> 24:24.291
I'm sorry, honey.
That's all there is to it.

24:52.375 --> 24:54.667
You know what
your problem is?

24:54.750 --> 24:58.917
It's this minivan.
Everything died when you
got this minivan.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.959
As soon as you have kids,
you'll want the three-zone
temperature control,

25:03.041 --> 25:06.625
easy-roll-out seats,
entertainment center
with fold-down screen,

25:06.709 --> 25:09.333
six CD/DVD changer and
the wireless headphones.

25:09.417 --> 25:13.750
- You're gonna want it all.
- I will never get a minivan.

25:13.834 --> 25:15.875
- You know why?
- Mm.

25:15.959 --> 25:19.458
Because the minivan
is the end of sex.

25:19.542 --> 25:21.125
Yeah, man.

25:21.208 --> 25:26.083
It's the vehicle you take
to the land of the
never-ending dry spell.

25:26.166 --> 25:29.667
You slide that heavy
side-door shut and bam!

25:29.750 --> 25:34.000
[mimics child]
"Are we there yet?"
Yeah, you're there.

25:34.083 --> 25:38.583
Your penis is here,
but you are definitely,
definitely there.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.583
[women chattering]

25:40.667 --> 25:42.542
Hey, Jimmy.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.458
[sighs]

25:51.542 --> 25:54.542
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, shoot.

25:54.625 --> 25:56.959
Why did you agree to this
open marriage thing?

25:57.041 --> 25:58.959
Because I wanted
to get laid.

25:59.041 --> 26:02.625
I haven't had sex
since Carrie was born.
I'm surprised Carrie was born.

26:02.709 --> 26:05.792
I don't remember
having sex for two years
before that, dude.

26:05.875 --> 26:08.166
I am dying.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.625
This thing is the devil.

26:11.709 --> 26:13.542
[car engine starting]

26:17.125 --> 26:19.583
- OK, are you in
or are you out?
- What do you mean?

26:19.667 --> 26:22.291
You could spend the day
with your girlfriend.

26:22.375 --> 26:23.709
Fiancée.

26:27.208 --> 26:31.333
Look, I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation
for the fight with Park Guy.

26:31.417 --> 26:32.709
- In or out?
- In.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.458
- All right. Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah, anytime.

26:46.333 --> 26:48.333
I'm making
grilled cheese.

26:49.417 --> 26:50.875
Why?

26:50.959 --> 26:52.291
I find it therapeutic.

26:52.375 --> 26:55.166
When I'm feeling anxious,
I need to eat something hot.

26:55.250 --> 26:58.750
- I hope you don't mind.
- I mind if you're
only making one.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.166
What if that's
you and me in 13 years,

27:04.250 --> 27:07.375
wishing we could have
a romance with a cute guy
in the park?

27:07.458 --> 27:10.625
Even Deena, with
the greatest husband
in the world...

27:12.125 --> 27:15.500
I mean, if Dave
and Deena can't make it,
who the hell can?

27:16.333 --> 27:17.542
I don't know.

27:17.625 --> 27:20.166
I don't wanna know what
it feels like to lose...

27:21.333 --> 27:24.208
that lust for your man.

27:24.291 --> 27:27.917
- To have to find
that somewhere else.
- Well, then don't.

27:29.625 --> 27:31.667
Work at it.
Try new things.

27:32.875 --> 27:35.417
- Do you have a spatula?
- Is that a euphemism?

27:38.667 --> 27:42.291
It's not like I couldn't
have screwed anyone.
Believe me, I could have.

27:42.375 --> 27:46.208
You know that girl
Suzanne from Leviathan?
She wants me... bad.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.083
- How do you know?
- Because, dude, I know.

27:50.166 --> 27:53.041
- So, why don't you
just hit that?
- I can't just hit that.

27:53.125 --> 27:55.625
- I'm not a "hit that"
kind of guy.
- You're scared.

27:55.709 --> 27:58.083
- [scoffs] Scared.
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:58.166 --> 28:02.917
You were that guy in college
who invited the girl to his
room to look at his CDs

28:03.000 --> 28:05.250
and you actually
showed her your CDs.

28:05.333 --> 28:07.709
I had over
one thousand CDs.

28:07.792 --> 28:09.792
That was a lot
for back then.

28:12.250 --> 28:15.875
- Look, I almost
did it with Suzanne.
- So? What happened?

28:17.834 --> 28:20.250
I don't wanna lose Deena.

28:20.333 --> 28:24.000
I love my wife.
I love the way she smells.

28:24.083 --> 28:27.959
I love the food she cooks,
the jokes she laughs at,

28:28.041 --> 28:30.083
the way she is
with the kids.

28:31.583 --> 28:33.250
I just love her.

28:36.792 --> 28:39.583
Go ahead. Say it.

28:39.667 --> 28:41.667
"Dave wears panties."

28:43.667 --> 28:46.500
I know I'm gonna feel
the exact same way
with Marjorie.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.375
- Yeah.
- I already do.

28:52.291 --> 28:54.333
[Angelo]
Honey, we're home.

28:54.417 --> 28:57.625
What are you guys doing here?
I thought you were playing golf.

28:57.709 --> 28:59.625
- We did.
- We were.

28:59.709 --> 29:02.750
- Well, where's Adam and Dave?
- Dave dropped us off.

29:02.834 --> 29:05.166
He and Adam had
to go get something.

29:05.250 --> 29:07.583
Oh. Well, good.

29:07.667 --> 29:09.792
Marjorie, we have men.

29:09.875 --> 29:12.417
- [Marjorie] I'm not
coming out in this.
- Why not?

29:12.500 --> 29:15.792
- Because I think
this might be the one.
- You're kidding? Really?

29:15.875 --> 29:18.667
Guys aren't supposed
to see me before
the wedding day.

29:18.750 --> 29:22.375
That's only Adam that's
not supposed to see you.
These guys don't count.

29:22.458 --> 29:24.417
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.166
[Marjorie]
OK, I'm coming out.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.500
♪ Here comes the bride ♪

29:28.583 --> 29:31.709
♪ Here comes
the bride ♪♪

29:37.083 --> 29:38.083
Yeah.

29:39.792 --> 29:40.917
Do you like it?

29:46.583 --> 29:47.667
Wow.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.083
[Angelo speaks Italian]

30:03.333 --> 30:06.041
[Nicole] So you guys didn't
get to play golf at all?

30:06.125 --> 30:07.375
No.

30:09.750 --> 30:10.959
Nicole.

30:13.083 --> 30:16.291
Dave and Deena
are having an open marriage.

30:16.375 --> 30:17.625
I know.

30:19.625 --> 30:22.333
- I don't like it.
- I don't either.

30:23.834 --> 30:27.250
[sighing] We followed her
around all day.

30:27.333 --> 30:30.750
You followed her?
Did you see anything?

30:30.834 --> 30:33.667
Only what happens
when people keep secrets.

30:36.250 --> 30:39.166
We must never
have secrets, Nicole.

30:39.250 --> 30:42.083
No matter if you think
I will be mad.

30:42.166 --> 30:45.000
You must always
tell me everything.

30:48.166 --> 30:49.166
Promise?

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
- Honey, I'll meet you
right out there.
- All right.

31:04.291 --> 31:05.375
Do you want one?

31:07.417 --> 31:10.333
- Good hydration
is very important.
- [Nicole chuckles]

31:11.250 --> 31:13.583
So, I like Lisa B.

31:13.667 --> 31:15.750
I like Lisa, too.

31:15.834 --> 31:18.041
I think
she's really great.

31:18.125 --> 31:21.291
She drinks
her cereal milk.

31:21.375 --> 31:23.000
Angelo isn't circumcised.

31:28.417 --> 31:31.125
I know what you want.

31:31.208 --> 31:34.792
You want some perfect thing,
that something that...

31:34.875 --> 31:38.166
doesn't turn into
Mom and Dad,
hating each other.

31:38.250 --> 31:39.959
What are you trying
to say?

31:40.041 --> 31:42.458
So what if Lisa B.
drinks her cereal milk?

31:43.959 --> 31:47.125
You don't think Marjorie
drinks her milk straight
from the bowl?

31:47.208 --> 31:49.041
We're not talking
about Marjorie.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.542
Yes, we are. I'm not blind.

32:00.458 --> 32:03.041
I want you to be happy,
no matter what it takes.

32:05.750 --> 32:08.667
But Adam is your best friend,
since we were kids.

32:10.166 --> 32:12.709
You gotta realize
what's at stake here.

32:14.041 --> 32:17.583
Either you talk to him
or let this go.

32:22.333 --> 32:23.834
I'm trying.

32:26.750 --> 32:28.250
Are you?

32:30.291 --> 32:31.625
Are you really?

32:41.208 --> 32:43.583
- Call me later, Bri.
- Bye, Nic.

32:43.667 --> 32:47.417
- See you, Marjorie.
- You looked beautiful
in that dress.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.834
Thank you.

32:53.166 --> 32:55.709
You wanna go for
a walk or something?

33:02.542 --> 33:04.458
[dog barks]

33:04.542 --> 33:07.083
Hey, buddy. Hey.

33:07.166 --> 33:08.667
Lisa?

33:15.709 --> 33:17.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:17.834 --> 33:20.542
- What's with the bag?
- I wanna go home.

33:20.625 --> 33:24.542
But I wanted to wait
for you, say goodbye.

33:24.625 --> 33:26.083
I thought that
we were gonna...

33:26.166 --> 33:28.208
Marjorie came over
this morning.

33:28.291 --> 33:29.709
She did?

33:29.792 --> 33:32.709
Did you tell her
I heard that message?

33:32.792 --> 33:35.625
- Well, yeah.
- What is with you two?

33:35.709 --> 33:39.500
- She's my friend.
- Come on, Brian.

33:39.583 --> 33:43.500
There's something there.
I mean, if you can't
see it, I can.

33:49.625 --> 33:52.125
I want it to go away.

33:52.208 --> 33:55.667
Then tell her
to stop calling you
and stop coming over.

33:59.166 --> 34:02.041
- Will you do that?
- We're friends.

34:07.041 --> 34:08.709
That's what she said.

34:16.875 --> 34:19.500
I need to go home.
I'll see you.

34:31.959 --> 34:35.333
[Adam] You know, you're right.
This thing drives really well.

34:35.417 --> 34:39.834
And this seat is
the most comfortable seat
I have ever sat in.

34:42.375 --> 34:46.667
Forget car seats.
I'm talking any seat
anywhere, recliners included.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.000
Told you.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.458
[sighs]
We're almost home.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.959
Today was a big,
giant goose chase.

34:56.041 --> 34:59.500
- You gotta admit,
it was kind of fun.
- Oh, yeah, it was a blast.

34:59.583 --> 35:02.500
Like Deena's gonna
have an affair.
Don't be ridiculous.

35:02.583 --> 35:04.583
- You never know.
- I know.

35:04.667 --> 35:08.959
But whatever you're going
through, it's just a phase,
a seventh-inning stretch.

35:09.041 --> 35:12.083
- You guys are made
for each other.
- Ease back for a second.

35:12.166 --> 35:14.291
She's gonna make a right
here in the alley.

35:17.417 --> 35:18.750
Where's she going?

35:18.834 --> 35:20.333
I don't know.

35:20.417 --> 35:23.583
She's definitely not
going home.

35:35.208 --> 35:38.125
[♪♪]

36:36.667 --> 36:38.166
We should kill him.

36:41.583 --> 36:44.083
- You and me, right now.
- Stop talking.

36:44.166 --> 36:45.875
Let's go.

36:45.959 --> 36:48.166
Please. OK?
Just stop talking.

36:48.250 --> 36:50.875
You can kill him.
You have the right
to kill him.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.583
That is your wife.
She is your wife!

36:54.583 --> 36:56.208
Shut up.

36:57.083 --> 36:58.583
Please.

37:02.375 --> 37:06.166
Oh, this is all wrong.
This is all wrong.

37:08.250 --> 37:09.917
I mean,
you guys are the couple.

37:11.333 --> 37:14.375
You guys are the couple
that we all wanna be.

37:16.417 --> 37:18.375
I mean,
you're Dave and Deena.

37:19.208 --> 37:21.208
You're Dave and Deena.

37:28.875 --> 37:31.542
So you're saying
that you wanna just...

37:33.709 --> 37:35.709
...cool it down
for a little bit, huh?

37:38.000 --> 37:39.500
Maybe.

37:42.041 --> 37:44.166
You're wearing
the necklace.

37:45.291 --> 37:46.625
Yeah.

37:51.583 --> 37:53.583
- Sometimes I just...
- What?

37:54.500 --> 37:56.500
I just like you.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.000
I really do.

38:00.417 --> 38:02.500
And I...

38:02.583 --> 38:06.792
I wanna walk outside
with you, I wanna
hold hands with you,

38:06.875 --> 38:09.583
and introduce you
to my friends,
like a real couple.

38:09.667 --> 38:11.583
I am part
of a real couple.

38:13.417 --> 38:15.917
- You always
have to remind me.
- Yeah, I do.

38:17.166 --> 38:21.041
I've been part of a real couple
for thirteen years.

38:21.125 --> 38:24.917
- Well, I'm not trying to...
- You're not? Huh.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.375
You throw your marriage
in my face like
it's this perfect thing,

38:28.458 --> 38:30.917
- when obviously it isn't.
- You don't know.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.625
I have a good marriage.

38:33.959 --> 38:35.792
Then what are you
doing here?

38:42.625 --> 38:44.417
- Don't get in.
- What?

38:44.500 --> 38:46.500
There's a cab
right there. Take that.

38:46.583 --> 38:48.792
Dave, what are you
talking about?

38:48.875 --> 38:50.375
Just go.

39:06.291 --> 39:09.250
You can't break it
on purpose. If you do,
it doesn't count.

39:09.333 --> 39:10.792
Your wish
won't come true.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.500
Yeah, it will.

39:16.750 --> 39:20.959
I'm sorry, Richard.
I just don't think
I wanna do this anymore.

39:56.542 --> 39:58.542
[door opens]

40:02.417 --> 40:05.041
Brian. Hey.
What are you doing here?

40:06.125 --> 40:09.125
- Is Adam here?
- No.

40:09.208 --> 40:12.875
- Did you go and see Lisa?
- What?

40:12.959 --> 40:15.458
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

40:15.542 --> 40:19.083
- Couldn't help yourself?
You had to go?
- I was trying to be nice.

40:19.166 --> 40:21.417
Nice?

40:21.500 --> 40:23.792
Marjorie,
why can't you see it?

40:24.959 --> 40:27.000
I mean, it is so obvious.

40:27.083 --> 40:30.250
You sabotage
all my relationships. You...

40:30.333 --> 40:35.000
You want me to be in love
with you. You need it.
You get off on it.

40:35.083 --> 40:38.125
You think my whole world
revolves around you?

40:38.208 --> 40:41.166
All you are is
my fiancé's best friend.

40:42.375 --> 40:44.041
I don't believe you.

40:47.125 --> 40:48.750
Leave the damn dishes.

40:48.834 --> 40:51.000
You should have kept
your mouth shut.

40:51.083 --> 40:52.750
- You kissed me.
- You kissed me.

40:52.834 --> 40:54.834
You wanted to prove
that you could.

40:54.917 --> 40:57.125
You can't stand it
that Adam had the guts

40:57.208 --> 40:59.375
to take a chance and
commit to something.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.542
- He was gonna
break up with you.
- So what?

41:01.625 --> 41:03.458
You are exactly
the same way.

41:03.542 --> 41:05.917
You think I don't
see how you are
with these women?

41:06.000 --> 41:08.959
How you make them
feel like they are
the greatest thing,

41:09.041 --> 41:13.709
and then the minute
that they act like a normal
human being, you leave them.

41:13.792 --> 41:17.709
I mean, what if I did
leave Adam? Then what? Huh?

41:17.792 --> 41:21.500
You'd be happy at first
and then, little by little,
you would pick me apart.

41:23.291 --> 41:25.542
- Are you thinking
of leaving Adam?
- No.

41:25.625 --> 41:27.625
Then why do you say that?

41:28.750 --> 41:30.375
Why do you drop that in,

41:30.458 --> 41:33.250
that "What if?"
That knife in my gut.

41:33.333 --> 41:37.083
Because you want me
to keep hanging on.
You want me to keep hoping.

41:37.166 --> 41:38.875
What are you
hoping for, Brian?

41:38.959 --> 41:42.333
Nothing can ever happen.
If it did, you would
lose Adam forever.

41:42.417 --> 41:45.291
- Do you want that?
- Of course not!
That's not what I want!

41:45.375 --> 41:49.125
Then why do you say it?
Just let it go. Stop it.

41:49.208 --> 41:51.208
Because every time
I try...

41:51.291 --> 41:54.834
[arguing continues]
