01:34.719 --> 01:36.846
<i>Everybody's got a story.</i>

01:37.639 --> 01:38.890
<i>A beginning...</i>

01:40.642 --> 01:41.768
<i>a middle...</i>

01:45.647 --> 01:46.648
<i>an end.</i>

01:51.820 --> 01:54.489
<i>Of course,
there's the story people tell you...</i>

01:59.577 --> 02:01.079
<i>and then there's the truth.</i>

02:04.499 --> 02:06.126
I'll recommend a closed casket.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.352
Something wrong, Ms. Jones?

02:25.562 --> 02:29.858
My adoptive mother was just murdered,
and I'm supposed to be at the mortuary.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.734
But don't let that stop you.

02:31.818 --> 02:35.613
Must be a terrible strain,
losing someone that way.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.240
Is that your idea of a motive?

02:38.199 --> 02:40.410
Grief makes people do crazy things.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.786
We weren't that close.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.916
What are they looking for,
the Lindbergh baby?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.544
We tend to be thorough
when one of our own is killed.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.505
Well, I would say, "It wasn't me."

02:52.589 --> 02:55.216
But it kind of loses impact
after the 50th time.

02:55.925 --> 02:59.220
What did you and Officer Nussbaumer talk
about after he turned off his body cam?

02:59.304 --> 03:02.974
- I don't discuss my cases.
- If he was a case, who was the client?

03:04.017 --> 03:06.657
- We are not square, you piece of...
- Who the hell...

03:06.978 --> 03:08.730
People hire me in confidence.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.858
You said you were home last night. Alone?

03:12.400 --> 03:14.360
- Is that a crime?
- No.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.487
Not much of an alibi, either.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.449
Let's see your hands.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.285
Somebody beat Officer Nussbaumer to death.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.412
Your hands have been
murder weapons before.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.253
- Your powers include fast healing?
- Not that fast.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.603
- What the hell is this?
- Research.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.566
More like motive,
for a super vigilante to flex her muscles

03:53.650 --> 03:55.860
and take out a dirty cop.

03:55.944 --> 04:00.281
Nussbaumer robbed and killed drug dealers,
a lot of them kids.

04:00.865 --> 04:04.661
One of those kids cracked my skull open
with a bike lock.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.972
I wouldn't be here
if Nussbaumer hadn't stood his ground.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.248
Detective.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.376
We'll check this out.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.604
Knock yourself out.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.713
- I need to take this.
- We're not finished.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.257
Then goddamn arrest me.

04:21.928 --> 04:22.928
We'll be in touch.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.978
I don't know what kinda deal
you had with Detective Costa,

04:30.061 --> 04:31.854
but it got him suspended.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.356
We won't look the other way.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.738
<i>The clues tell a story
that points to me.</i>

04:42.282 --> 04:43.866
<i>But the cops don't know Erik.</i>

04:47.161 --> 04:48.705
<i>Maybe I don't, either.</i>

04:59.424 --> 05:00.758
Hey, sorry I'm late.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.763
- Are you okay?
- I don't... I don't know.

05:05.847 --> 05:10.184
Good morning. My name is Eugene Burchell.
You can call me Gene.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.186
I'm very sorry for your loss.

05:12.270 --> 05:16.190
I know Dorothy Walker
was a devoted mother, a loyal friend,

05:16.274 --> 05:19.777
and a style icon
who improved every life she touched.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.154
Did Dorothy write that?

05:21.237 --> 05:24.699
Uh your mother left behind
very specific instructions.

05:26.326 --> 05:30.955
- She's going to be in one of these forever.
- I don't know how to choose.

05:31.039 --> 05:35.001
- Sounds like Dorothy already chose, right?
- Yeah, and it's a blessing.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.628
Planning a service
can be very hard on the family.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.922
But Mrs. Walker's attorney
sent over the details...

05:40.006 --> 05:42.675
No! No Hogarth.

05:44.302 --> 05:47.555
My mom hired her firm
right around the time that I did.

05:47.638 --> 05:50.641
They represent her murderer, too, Gene.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.853
Does that seem weird to you, Gene?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.565
God. They have her will.

05:57.648 --> 06:01.235
Well, you need to file the original
in probate court.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.529
Not helping, Gene.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.951
I'll get the original, and I'll deal
with Hogarth's minions, okay?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.829
And your mother selected
a playlist for the service,

06:11.913 --> 06:14.999
featuring several
of your own songs, Ms. Walker.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.878
She also requested
a memory board at the service.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.421
What's a memory board?

06:20.505 --> 06:25.885
Where each guest is asked to pin a photo
or memento that reminds them of her.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.847
Well... I don't have a recent, uh, photo.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.432
We'll get something.

06:31.516 --> 06:35.436
Uh, she also asked
that you give the eulogy.

06:36.604 --> 06:40.149
"I know Pats won't leave a dry eye
in the house."

06:40.900 --> 06:42.735
It's entirely up to you. If you don't...

06:42.819 --> 06:46.948
It's okay. I'll just... I'll...
I'll let her down one last time.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.909
Hey, why don't you go get some air?
I'll handle this.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.791
Uh, well, she went with the Senator.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.169
An outstanding choice.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.733
- We found a file in her office.
- She's a private investigator!

07:04.757 --> 07:06.437
Listen to me.
I think you need...

07:06.509 --> 07:07.427
Shit!

07:07.510 --> 07:09.350
We're trying to fill in
some gaps in her story.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.640
- Come on. You are trying to pin it on her.
- They won't.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.684
Are we harassing grieving women now?

07:14.767 --> 07:15.601
Just doing our jobs.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.188
If following me around
is the best use of your time, fine.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.816
But leave my family alone. Come on.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.734
- Sorry for your loss.
- How dare you?

07:23.818 --> 07:26.779
Don't antagonize them.
I've got that part covered.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.867
- How did you even get on their radar?
- I'm always on their radar.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.535
Jess, tell me.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.122
- I didn't kill that guy.
- Obviously.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.207
I think I know who did.

07:39.792 --> 07:43.713
- You think Sallinger did this?
- No, he's tied to an IV in a hospital bed.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.549
Well, then who?

07:47.175 --> 07:48.175
Erik.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.887
Why would Erik kill a cop?

07:50.970 --> 07:53.389
Nussbaumer was one of his old marks.

07:54.265 --> 07:57.018
Maybe he felt bad
that he hadn't stopped him earlier.

07:58.394 --> 08:02.398
Or he's following my example,
trying on his hero pants.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.651
- I mean, you know him better than I do.
- I thought I did.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.488
I take it you're not gonna hand him over.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.615
I just need to find out what happened.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.117
- What can I do?
- Nothing. I got this.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.201
Okay.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.537
Keep me posted.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.707
Try and get some rest.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.737
- Kith Lyonne is here.
- Show her in.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.993
I'll be right back with your tea.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.336
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

09:07.588 --> 09:11.008
What fresh hell
has Peter's crimes brought me today?

09:11.092 --> 09:15.054
Good news.
The IRS has agreed to a reduced fine.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.182
And, other than Patseras,

09:18.266 --> 09:23.437
the defrauded foundation donors
will accept a minor settlement.

09:24.605 --> 09:28.025
- I don't have the money.
- I do.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.779
This a loan. This is the agreement.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.451
I don't need you to be grateful,
but don't be stubborn.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.749
Thank you.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.090
Demetri Patseras.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.925
What about him?

09:53.843 --> 09:57.555
His refusal to settle it,
it feels like a personal vendetta.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.181
Is it?

09:59.265 --> 10:02.393
Demetri and his wife
gave us the seed money for the foundation.

10:02.476 --> 10:06.814
They were Peter's clients
and our closest friends until...

10:07.857 --> 10:10.151
I noticed bruising on Fiona's shoulders.

10:11.193 --> 10:14.238
Patseras doesn't have a record
of domestic violence.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.116
Fi didn't want him to go to jail,
but I got her away from him,

10:17.199 --> 10:19.452
and Demetri blames me
for the breakup of his marriage.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.120
A fact I used to take pride in.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.248
Don't worry, sweetie. I...
I'll look into it.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.627
I have a forensic accountant
digging into his records right now.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.630
Why?

10:31.797 --> 10:33.674
We all have our weaknesses.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.762
Okay, well, call me with any updates.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.430
Kith, we have more to discuss.

10:39.513 --> 10:43.643
And be careful. Demetri is aggressive
in business and in life.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.811
- So am I.
- I know.

10:50.941 --> 10:51.942
That was fast.

10:52.026 --> 10:55.488
Set up a meeting with Trish Walker.
Sooner the better.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.407
- But her mother was just...
- I'm aware.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.953
I wonder if we should maybe wait
until after the funeral?

11:03.871 --> 11:06.707
Who's covering Dorothy Walker's estate
for the firm?

11:06.791 --> 11:07.792
Berman.

11:08.793 --> 11:09.669
Send him up.

11:09.752 --> 11:10.753
Okay.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.690
<i>Most memories
aren't worth saving.</i>

11:31.315 --> 11:33.109
<i>Much less pinning on a memory board.</i>

12:22.867 --> 12:24.577
<i>Pictures tell stories, too.</i>

12:30.499 --> 12:33.127
<i>But sometimes the real story
is just out of frame.</i>

12:37.965 --> 12:40.885
You're right. Those detectives
got eyes on the front door

12:40.968 --> 12:43.137
like a batter
waiting for the perfect pitch.

12:44.388 --> 12:45.806
To take a swing at me.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.857
Did you get robbed or something?

12:55.900 --> 12:58.611
The aforementioned detectives.

12:59.069 --> 13:04.533
Nussbaumer. Jesus. I saw it on the news.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.120
- Are they trying to pin that on you?
- Got it in one.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.915
I have shit for an alibi,

13:11.499 --> 13:14.001
and a face that's all over
his body cam footage.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.046
Shit.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.841
Don't worry. You weren't on camera.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.481
Even though you're the one
with the motive.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.430
Jessica...

13:29.058 --> 13:30.309
I didn't do it.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.437
Do you have an alibi for last night?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.690
You're gonna need one
if the cops get onto you.

13:38.317 --> 13:41.529
I'm... I'm innocent, that's my alibi.
Yours, too.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.496
Not a dent on 'em.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.708
Look, Nussbaumer threatened you.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.854
- If he came after you, things got ugly...
- Not what happened.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.214
I would understand that.
I'd be able to help you.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.799
I don't need your help.

14:01.882 --> 14:05.761
Shit. I've never wished
my power on anybody,

14:05.845 --> 14:09.390
but if you had it right now,
you'd be standing here headache-free.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.186
You want to know the truth?

14:15.396 --> 14:17.690
I am glad Nussbaumer is dead.

14:17.773 --> 14:21.527
He's an evil prick,
and the world is better off without him.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.737
And I promise you...

14:25.197 --> 14:26.490
I didn't kill him.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.203
I'm trying to believe you.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.626
Well, I'm gonna let you work on that.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.883
Try and keep yourself out of trouble.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.864
- Well, you're not okay.
- Are you asking or telling?

15:06.947 --> 15:09.909
I don't have to ask.
Two detectives came by and questioned me.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.286
Said they have evidence you killed a cop.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.622
They have circumstantial bullshit.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.415
Good. That's what I told them.

15:16.832 --> 15:17.832
You want to hire me.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.003
- Asking or telling?
- Both.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.713
They don't have any other suspects.

15:23.839 --> 15:24.839
I do.

15:25.966 --> 15:26.967
Erik.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.554
I will tail him.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.431
He's my mess to clean up.

15:33.390 --> 15:36.185
If I can find time
around funeral planning.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.395
God. You really
should be taking some time off.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.272
It's not like Dorothy and I were besties.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.818
Nussbaumer was a dick.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.946
There's gotta be someone else
who wanted him dead.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.073
I'll find you another suspect.

15:50.157 --> 15:53.661
Find the truth,
starting with what the cops have.

15:54.411 --> 15:58.248
- I'm not paying you Hogarth's numbers.
- Well, neither is she. I quit.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.209
Got fired.

16:00.668 --> 16:01.669
Both.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.338
Welcome back to humanity.

16:04.421 --> 16:08.050
You should know, uh, working for Hogarth,

16:08.926 --> 16:11.637
I did some things,
the kind that change you.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.054
You know.

16:13.847 --> 16:16.392
If the new you
is less of a sanctimonious asshole,

16:16.475 --> 16:17.935
then it'll be an upgrade.

16:37.496 --> 16:41.083
I'm here to see Mr. Berman,
regarding Dorothy Walker's will.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.168
That will be in the conference room
in the back.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.760
What the hell are you doing here?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.044
I'm supposed to be meeting
with the deceased's daughter.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.723
You are.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.307
Her actual daughter.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.560
And I'm supposed to be meeting
the third-rate associate

16:59.643 --> 17:01.812
who handles cases
way below your pay grade.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.897
Berman had a conflict.
I was happy to step up.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.880
Then you're lucky it's just me here.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.777
I understand that she is upset.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.863
But I wanted to tell her
I plan to terminate

17:10.945 --> 17:12.986
my professional relationship
with Gregory Sallinger.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.199
You plan to?

17:14.282 --> 17:15.992
I regret having helped him.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.453
Just give me the will.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.789
Trish will receive half of everything.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.000
"The other half shall go

17:23.083 --> 17:25.877
to the Dorothy Walker Fund
for Women in the Arts."

17:26.462 --> 17:27.921
Dorothy had a charity?

17:28.714 --> 17:32.134
She wrote, "Because I never forgot
how it feels to have nothing."

17:33.052 --> 17:34.386
And it was a tax shelter.

17:34.845 --> 17:37.097
And it was a tax shelter.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.184
She also wrote,
"To my adopted daughter, Jessica,

17:40.267 --> 17:43.854
who has so much potential,
if only she'd learn how to take advice..."

17:43.937 --> 17:45.314
She's talking shit in her will.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.775
"...I leave the remaining contents
of my liquor cabinet..."

17:48.442 --> 17:49.443
Another dig.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.988
"...and my Edwardian wingback armchair."

17:56.158 --> 17:57.158
Was it valuable?

17:58.160 --> 17:59.161
No.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.374
I just used to sit in it after school,
plugged into my Discman.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.701
She finally put it in my room.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.880
I just assumed she was banishing me
from the rest of the house.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.926
I can read the rest myself.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.554
You'll also have to file
a death certificate,

18:17.638 --> 18:22.476
alert Social Security, DMV, post office.
But we can handle all of that here.

18:22.559 --> 18:23.559
You're fired.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.314
- Is this the original?
- Of course.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.691
From the coroner.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.487
Everything Dorothy had on her
the day that she died.

18:35.864 --> 18:39.743
Trish is going to need a good lawyer,
and I'm the best.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.372
You'd be helping her
by facilitating a meeting.

18:44.790 --> 18:48.085
Dorothy had no clue
that she was about to die...

18:49.795 --> 18:53.173
and even she wanted to do something good
before she checked out.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.176
You know you're dying.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.595
What are you doing?

19:00.139 --> 19:03.892
Trying to fix a mistake.
Several, actually.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.397
How is it that you
make even that feel calculating?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.914
- Did you finish writing the obituary?
- Just started.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.126
The cops came by while I was cleaning up
the mess they made.

19:29.209 --> 19:32.087
Did they apologize?
They most certainly did not.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.505
What'd you tell them?

19:33.589 --> 19:35.716
That I'd never personally
seen you murder anyone.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.428
Thanks. Get this developed. Rush it.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.847
Film. How retro.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.270
- You got a minute?
- Got an appointment?

19:48.353 --> 19:50.033
Malcolm's working a case
with me.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.857
As in freelancing?

19:51.940 --> 19:54.693
If I knew we had disposable income,
I would have asked for a raise.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.236
Not disposable.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.946
I got the Nussbaumer police file.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.781
You might want to start with the photos.

20:07.956 --> 20:10.000
Yeah. That one caught my eye, too.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.210
Where is his badge?

20:12.169 --> 20:13.378
Notably missing.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.894
That's what they were searching here for.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.567
If Erik has the badge, then...

20:17.591 --> 20:20.427
<i>♪ Cray cray
I want your cray ♪</i>

20:20.510 --> 20:23.388
<i>♪ Cray cray cray
I want your cray ♪</i>

20:23.472 --> 20:26.808
<i>♪ Hey, I want your cray cray ♪</i>

20:26.892 --> 20:30.437
<i>♪ I want your

20:30.562 --> 20:34.691
<i>♪ Hey, I want your cray cray

20:37.319 --> 20:38.153
Hello?

20:38.237 --> 20:40.155
<i>Dorothy,
you're not going to believe it!</i>

20:40.906 --> 20:44.284
Um, no, sorry, it's... it's not her.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.995
<i>Can you give her a message, please?
I got the part!</i>

20:47.079 --> 20:48.580
<i>She was right about the accent.</i>

20:48.664 --> 20:50.582
<i>- The director loved it.</i>
- Dorothy's dead.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.752
<i>Uh, I don't...</i>

20:54.336 --> 20:57.673
<i>She's dead? I... I just saw her.</i>

20:58.423 --> 21:01.426
I know. It's a lot.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.887
<i>Who is this?</i>

21:05.389 --> 21:06.390
I'm, uh...

21:07.975 --> 21:08.976
family.

21:09.518 --> 21:13.605
<i>Oh, my God. I'm so sorry for your loss.</i>

21:14.690 --> 21:15.691
Thank you.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.278
<i>Let me know
if there's anything I can do.</i>

21:30.706 --> 21:32.165
Hey. You're here.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.543
You changed the locks?

21:35.335 --> 21:38.630
No. I mean, yeah. I just repaired them.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.681
Thanks.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.319
So, look, I'm sorry I didn't call. I...

22:00.402 --> 22:02.279
Just didn't want to tell me you got fired?

22:03.864 --> 22:04.948
It was a bad fit.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.828
Which is why I left.
To do better. Be better.

22:09.911 --> 22:12.664
To help Jessica, you mean.
And that masked vigilante.

22:13.665 --> 22:19.671
You are a smart, talented, capable man.
You could get a legitimate job anywhere.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.549
Zaya, you don't... I can't...

22:23.633 --> 22:29.139
No, I don't need... to compete
at your level, in your arena.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.433
So, what? I'm too good for you?

22:31.516 --> 22:35.979
I am just better equipped to be
helping people who actually need help.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.231
While I help the unworthy.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.526
Hey, this had nothing to do with you.

22:41.610 --> 22:45.155
Except you left the firm. My firm.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.366
And I can't help but think

22:47.449 --> 22:50.386
that maybe you're trying to leave me, too.
That that's why you didn't call.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.930
I didn't call because I couldn't tell you
what you want to hear.

22:53.997 --> 22:57.918
So speak your truth, Malcolm.
'Cause there's something more going on.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.183
I, uh...

23:15.477 --> 23:16.478
I've...

23:20.273 --> 23:21.608
I've done some bad shit.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.362
I know. Jeri made you.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.447
No, I don't blame anyone. I...

23:28.532 --> 23:31.368
chose everything that I did.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.578
So why are you punishing me?

23:35.038 --> 23:38.583
Because I work with Jeri? Want to be her?

23:38.667 --> 23:41.753
Because I'm pressuring you
to play in my arena?

23:41.837 --> 23:43.547
Making you into something you're not?

23:43.630 --> 23:48.051
- Tell me what is...
- Yes. Yes, that is why.

23:57.394 --> 24:01.022
I just... need some time.

24:14.369 --> 24:15.370
Okay.

24:20.834 --> 24:21.834
This...

24:23.170 --> 24:26.214
doesn't make you a better person, Malcolm.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.135
It makes you cruel.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.319
You want some?

24:48.195 --> 24:50.572
Fine.

25:08.924 --> 25:09.925
Can I come in?

25:11.426 --> 25:12.719
You still on the clock?

25:15.263 --> 25:16.348
Lunch break?

25:19.601 --> 25:21.811
You want me to make my case again?

25:21.895 --> 25:24.773
I'm getting good
at acting indignant and defensive.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.318
No, thanks.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.242
How are you holding up?

25:43.416 --> 25:45.710
Dorothy used to hit Trish.

25:46.836 --> 25:49.005
She was the first bad guy I ever fought.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.426
Or so I told myself.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.267
Yeah, well, my dad was an asshole, too.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.479
But it didn't make it
any easier to bury him.

26:06.481 --> 26:09.109
'Cause I was also burying
any chance that...

26:09.192 --> 26:12.153
he might miraculously turn
into a different person.

26:14.197 --> 26:16.491
No one's ever who you need them to be.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.878
Who do you need me to be?

26:30.213 --> 26:31.965
The person I thought you were.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.142
This person?

26:51.026 --> 26:52.193
This person?

27:21.514 --> 27:24.726
- This is about business, right?
- It is, but it's private.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.024
I spoke to Patseras and his counsel today.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.736
Demetri is not a pleasant man.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.321
He's a pig. What else?

27:36.404 --> 27:42.035
I threatened a countersuit.
I won't repeat his reply.

27:42.118 --> 27:43.578
We'd have a chance in court.

27:44.412 --> 27:48.416
But we would be in
for a very long and ugly fight.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.085
Well, I'm... I can't.

27:50.168 --> 27:52.796
I know.
That's why I asked you to come here.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.715
I'm aggressive.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.260
But a case like this, it...
it needs something more.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.888
What does that mean?

28:01.971 --> 28:06.393
My forensic accountant believes
that Patseras may be evading taxes.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.979
Now, she can't prove it
unless she has access to his records.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.524
Okay, his taxes are his taxes, so...

28:12.607 --> 28:14.067
His taxes are our leverage.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.947
I need your permission...
to color outside the lines.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.367
I know a woman who owes me a favor.

28:22.784 --> 28:25.995
She has abilities that give her
the kind of access that we need.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.748
Like the access you had
to Peter's records?

28:29.999 --> 28:31.584
I won't make a decision on your behalf.

28:31.668 --> 28:34.462
I want you to know everything
and to see everything.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.756
You want me to condone
what you did to Peter.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.844
I am asking you
to let me take care of this.

28:40.927 --> 28:43.304
By hurting Demetri the way you hurt Peter?

28:43.388 --> 28:47.809
Oh, Jesus. Demetri deserves this.
You know that.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.270
- Come on.
- You still don't get it, do you?

28:51.813 --> 28:52.981
You never will.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.065
Kith.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.296
<i>You don't decide
to trust someone.</i>

29:17.964 --> 29:19.090
<i>It happens...</i>

29:20.216 --> 29:24.387
<i>or it doesn't...
no matter how much you want it to.</i>

29:28.224 --> 29:31.728
<i>There's nothing I hate more than searching
for something I don't want to find.</i>

29:41.029 --> 29:43.656
<i>One story is always two stories.</i>

29:47.035 --> 29:48.661
<i>The one they show you...</i>

29:50.538 --> 29:52.665
<i>and, always, that damn truth.</i>

30:20.151 --> 30:24.322
<i>And the truth is, this looks like someone
searching for more wrongs to right.</i>

31:01.693 --> 31:02.861
Did you find the badge?

31:02.944 --> 31:05.655
No, just this file.
I'm sending it to you right now.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.617
I got it.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.412
Who's Jace Montero?

31:13.371 --> 31:14.971
Someone Erik
has been tracking.

31:15.039 --> 31:17.792
He had a file exactly like that
on Nussbaumer.

31:17.876 --> 31:18.960
And what am I looking for?

31:20.461 --> 31:22.881
- Proof of life.
- Yeah. You think he's a target.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.175
I'll call when I have something.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.053
And see you at the service.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.769
The film you wanted developed.

32:02.503 --> 32:03.671
I gotta get ready.

32:04.255 --> 32:07.717
- How's your poor sister holding up?
- She's not.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.301
Are you?

34:18.056 --> 34:19.724
Kith, hi. How are you?

34:19.806 --> 34:23.018
Demetri Patseras called.
He threatened to put me in jail.

34:23.101 --> 34:26.272
He... He's just reacting
to the countersuit threat.

34:26.355 --> 34:29.192
<i>He asked the DA
to file criminal charges of fraud.</i>

34:29.275 --> 34:31.819
- Laurent will be alone...
- <i>No.</i>

34:31.902 --> 34:34.864
Laurent will be with you.
I won't let that happen.

34:36.532 --> 34:37.784
I need it to be over.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.077
- I know.
- <i>Now.</i>

34:39.159 --> 34:40.953
I need it to be over now.

34:41.036 --> 34:43.246
<i>Do whatever it takes, Jeri.</i>

34:44.456 --> 34:47.460
<i>Color outside the lines.</i>

35:06.104 --> 35:07.563
What have you got?

35:08.356 --> 35:10.983
Jace Montero, he's a property developer

35:11.067 --> 35:13.945
with a new building going up
at 130th and Amsterdam.

35:14.028 --> 35:15.029
<i>Is he alive?</i>

35:15.696 --> 35:17.907
He answered the phone himself.
He was kind of a dick.

35:17.990 --> 35:20.535
Just like the rest
of Erik's blackmail marks.

35:20.618 --> 35:22.453
He might also be a murderer.

35:23.454 --> 35:26.207
A couple of his buildings
have very conveniently burned down.

35:26.290 --> 35:29.252
<i>And Erik's files show
big insurance payouts. People died.</i>

35:30.128 --> 35:32.338
Perfect target for a wannabe hero.

35:32.797 --> 35:36.676
I'll keep digging after the service. But,
um, at the moment, he's still breathing.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.595
Let's hope it stays that way.

35:58.781 --> 35:59.824
I'm not ready.

36:03.494 --> 36:04.787
Me neither.

36:09.542 --> 36:10.543
Okay.

36:49.749 --> 36:50.750
Berry.

36:51.334 --> 36:54.879
Brianna. I don't do "Berry" anymore.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.256
What are you doing here?

36:57.715 --> 37:01.177
I'm getting my shit together.
I'm looking for a job.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.055
A place to stay.

37:05.514 --> 37:07.266
You've got family in town.

37:07.350 --> 37:08.476
I've got a brother.

37:08.559 --> 37:11.020
And I want to prove I'm okay
before I tell him I'm back.

37:12.521 --> 37:13.564
I wasn't...

37:14.649 --> 37:17.610
...myself.

37:19.654 --> 37:20.738
But I'm back.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.825
And I won't force
any more blow jobs on you.

37:28.454 --> 37:31.165
I just need somebody
to give me a second chance.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.585
Yeah.

37:41.676 --> 37:42.677
Thank you.

37:52.311 --> 37:53.437
We're here.

37:58.359 --> 38:03.239
It's just a bunch of anecdotes
about Mom being Mom.

38:05.574 --> 38:06.784
Sounds right.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.663
She wanted more from me.

38:11.163 --> 38:13.249
It'll be over in less than an hour.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.168
Probably won't be much of a turnout, so...

38:16.752 --> 38:20.923
She wasn't perfect.
Doesn't make it any easier to bury her.

38:26.721 --> 38:27.888
Ready or not...

39:07.303 --> 39:09.096
You good on the couch again?

39:09.180 --> 39:13.142
I just slept ten hours
on a pukey Greyhound with busted AC.

39:13.225 --> 39:14.435
This is a major upgrade.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.145
Well, you know where everything is.

39:16.228 --> 39:18.856
There's not much in the fridge.
Some leftover Indian.

39:20.066 --> 39:21.108
And I have to go.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.153
It's a lot.

39:25.154 --> 39:28.574
Opening your door to a bipolar ex-hooker.

39:29.075 --> 39:32.661
That's not how I see you.
I judge myself. I don't judge you.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.915
Well, I'll be out of your hair
in a couple days.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.627
Stay as long as you need.

39:41.754 --> 39:46.926
What is wrong with you?
I mean, regular people aren't this good.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.553
No, don't.

39:50.388 --> 39:54.058
You are a good guy, Malcolm.

39:56.769 --> 39:59.063
And there's even leftover Indian.

40:08.072 --> 40:11.242
Oh, I'm sorry. I... That was...

40:34.974 --> 40:39.520
- Wait. You're not obligated.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.495
Your mother saved my career.

40:56.579 --> 40:59.623
I hated doing sex scenes,
so she told me to start screenwriting.

40:59.707 --> 41:02.543
Dorothy said skip couples therapy
and spend the cash on a face-lift

41:02.626 --> 41:03.711
and a divorce attorney.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.671
She helped my son rebrand
after he came out.

41:05.754 --> 41:09.633
She told me not to lose weight
'cause I'd get cast as a real person.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.469
She was right.

41:12.928 --> 41:13.929
Thank you.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.402
Let's go, boys.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.351
I found it on my old camera.

42:02.311 --> 42:04.480
I shot it by accident
the day that we went to see

42:04.563 --> 42:06.941
the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

42:07.024 --> 42:11.070
Mom got the train schedule wrong,
and we missed the parade by an hour.

42:11.654 --> 42:14.156
And Dorothy took us
to that shitty movie theater.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.241
So shitty.

42:17.117 --> 42:19.828
And the stale hot dog.
God. Everything went wrong.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.084
Yeah, but normal wrong.

42:26.919 --> 42:28.671
Just like a regular family.

42:30.130 --> 42:31.215
It's perfect.

42:32.132 --> 42:33.133
It's time.

42:37.263 --> 42:38.514
Thank you.

42:42.142 --> 42:43.227
Hey, what's wrong?

42:43.310 --> 42:46.063
The police were just here again.
With a warrant for your arrest.

42:46.146 --> 42:49.525
They found a witness.
Owner of a bodega on Nussbaumer's beat.

42:49.608 --> 42:50.901
<i>He saw you two go at it.</i>

42:50.985 --> 42:52.319
They're on their way here?

42:53.445 --> 42:54.655
I'm so sorry.

43:00.035 --> 43:02.246
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

43:18.262 --> 43:21.849
I... I thought I'd start by telling you

43:22.891 --> 43:25.644
a quintessential Dorothy Walker story

43:25.728 --> 43:28.647
about how she pushed me
to get a particular job

43:28.731 --> 43:31.734
on a sitcom called <i>That's Our Girl.</i>

43:34.945 --> 43:38.198
But I want to talk about something else.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.035
My mother's deepest fear.

43:42.745 --> 43:43.871
Failure.

43:45.456 --> 43:48.500
Not her own, but yours.

43:51.253 --> 43:55.966
My mother thought there was nothing
more precious in the world than talent.

43:57.134 --> 44:00.220
And nothing more shameful than wasting it.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.182
Yeah, that's what she was afraid of.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.143
That you'd waste it.

44:17.112 --> 44:20.741
You know, a lot of you, uh, just lost
the person who kept you motivated,

44:20.824 --> 44:24.578
and, uh, you might be tempted
to give it all up, but...

44:28.332 --> 44:29.332
Uh...

44:30.167 --> 44:31.167
But don't.

44:32.711 --> 44:33.712
Don't give up.

44:35.589 --> 44:39.802
She would want you
to do everything you can

44:39.885 --> 44:41.387
with what you've been given.

44:44.848 --> 44:46.517
<i>My mom was intense...</i>

44:48.602 --> 44:49.937
<i>and aggravating.</i>

44:51.397 --> 44:53.482
<i>And she could be mean as hell.</i>

45:03.992 --> 45:06.870
<i>But if Dorothy believed
that you had talent,</i>

45:06.954 --> 45:10.332
<i>she would move heaven and earth
to make damn sure you used it.</i>

45:17.881 --> 45:21.009
<i>Mom didn't want to hear about failure.</i>

45:33.355 --> 45:37.443
<i>She only wanted to hear three words.</i>

45:45.200 --> 45:46.368
<i>"I've got this."</i>

46:32.748 --> 46:33.749
Shit.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.168
Jessica Jones!

46:37.961 --> 46:39.129
Hands behind your head!

46:39.213 --> 46:41.649
You're under arrest
for the murder of Carl Nussbaumer.

46:41.673 --> 46:42.674
Not today.

46:43.300 --> 46:44.802
Stop or we'll shoot!

46:44.885 --> 46:47.888
God damn it. I didn't goddamn do it!

46:51.058 --> 46:52.058
Don't!

46:52.434 --> 46:53.434
Cuff her.

46:54.353 --> 46:55.793
You have the right to remain silent.

46:55.854 --> 46:58.565
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

47:36.144 --> 47:37.479
Somebody help me!

47:43.735 --> 47:44.778
Jesus.

47:55.205 --> 47:56.331
Oh, my God.
