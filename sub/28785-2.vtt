00:08.675 --> 00:10.427
I might have
another solution.

00:10.510 --> 00:11.761
Why not move the Agape here?

00:11.845 --> 00:13.430
What about your father-in-law?

00:13.513 --> 00:15.098
<i>The last time anyone saw you,</i>

00:15.181 --> 00:18.935
you nearly flew a plane
into Jack Parsons.

00:19.018 --> 00:22.897
Do you still carry that same
animosity in your heart?

00:24.691 --> 00:26.735
Jack Parsons
means nothing to me!

00:26.818 --> 00:29.779
Why don't we put all
the prospects to a vote

00:29.863 --> 00:31.781
and it has to be unanimous.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.450
Meaning...

00:33.533 --> 00:37.078
Jack can exclude
anyone he wants.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.955
<i>Jack's so busy with work,
I'd likely be voting on his behalf.</i>

00:39.038 --> 00:40.582
Ah,
you can just drop that there.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.625
<i>Let me put it another way.</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:45.170
Until you're ready, you won't
be able to participate.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.755
Who gets to decide if I'm ready?

00:46.838 --> 00:48.465
<i>I assumed Marisol was something</i>

00:48.548 --> 00:50.925
<i>that you just needed
to get out of your system.</i>

00:51.009 --> 00:53.136
Even your father dated
a Jewess once.

00:53.219 --> 00:55.513
Who are you talking to?

00:55.597 --> 00:57.974
No one. I'll fix
us up some drinks.

00:58.057 --> 00:59.267
<i>Mr. Parsons is reporting back</i>

00:59.350 --> 01:00.977
to an occultist
named Aleister Crowley.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.979
- You're aware of that, correct?
- I don't know anything

01:03.062 --> 01:04.272
about Aleister Crowley.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.648
We need to know if
he's still in touch

01:05.732 --> 01:06.649
with his pro-German
contacts

01:06.733 --> 01:08.943
in the U.S. and if
they're planning anything.

01:09.027 --> 01:09.944
I already told you,
I don't know.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.822
And I rave and I rape,

01:12.906 --> 01:15.784
and I rip and I rend.

01:15.867 --> 01:19.162
Everlasting world without end.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.876
Isn't everybody here already?

01:33.259 --> 01:35.011
Long time no see, Jack.

01:39.724 --> 01:43.019
<i>"Memoria
hospitis unius diei praetereuntis..."</i>

01:43.102 --> 01:47.190
<i>"Memoria hospitis unius
diei praetereuntis..."</i>

01:47.273 --> 01:49.526
I'd begun to think
I'd never see you again.

01:49.609 --> 01:53.029
You've been gone from us
for over two years.

01:53.112 --> 01:56.533
I never planned
on coming back.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.034
Then why have you?

02:00.328 --> 02:03.540
I know my true path, now.

02:03.623 --> 02:07.043
I need you to help me
take the final steps.

02:07.126 --> 02:08.919
And what steps are those?

02:09.002 --> 02:10.839
You know.

02:11.965 --> 02:16.219
You speak of
dangerous Magick.

02:16.302 --> 02:20.932
Before I help you move forward
on your path,

02:21.015 --> 02:23.560
I need to know
where you've been.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.228
I've been everywhere
and nowhere.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.354
Sit.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.147
I'd hit a dead end in L.A.,

02:28.231 --> 02:30.567
so I had to go traveling
the world in search of answers.

02:30.650 --> 02:31.734
I looked for
the master in London,

02:31.818 --> 02:33.027
but the city was under siege.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.238
I even went to the room
in Cairo and sat

02:35.321 --> 02:37.699
where the angel Aiwass
visited Crowley

02:37.782 --> 02:39.242
and gave him
<i>The Book of the Law.</i>

02:39.325 --> 02:40.910
And I heard of this...

02:40.994 --> 02:45.748
paradise in Morocco...

02:45.832 --> 02:48.084
Tangier.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.961
An entire city

02:50.044 --> 02:52.088
living under the same code
as the Agape.

02:52.171 --> 02:54.591
Where love and
freedom reign.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.259
And what happened there?

02:56.342 --> 02:59.012
That's not important.

03:01.806 --> 03:05.935
What's important is what
happened to me when I left.

03:06.019 --> 03:10.315
In the deserts outside the city,

03:10.398 --> 03:14.068
where my destiny was laid bare.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.165
After a long journey,
Frater E.D. has returned

03:27.248 --> 03:29.751
with an incredible revelation.

03:29.834 --> 03:34.088
He seeks the guidance of his
Magus and shall receive it.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.966
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.428
He tried to take my fucking
head off with a plane.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.889
If I wanted you dead, you
wouldn't still be sitting there.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.270
This is my house.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.981
I shouldn't have to bend
to his will.

03:52.065 --> 03:56.069
When you invited us
to move in...

03:56.152 --> 04:00.156
this became <i>our</i> home.

04:00.239 --> 04:04.160
Frater E.D. requires guidance
and rest.

04:04.243 --> 04:07.330
He stays until he receives both.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.165
"Love is the law."

04:09.248 --> 04:11.334
Love under will.

04:21.886 --> 04:23.888
Love under will.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.354
I thought you'd be
on my side about this.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.064
There are no "sides," Jack.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.232
We need to trust
our Magus, otherwise,

04:34.315 --> 04:35.817
what are we doing here?

04:35.900 --> 04:37.986
Ernest nearly sabotaged
us once before,

04:38.069 --> 04:40.697
and that was when we didn't
have anything to our name.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.365
But now? Can you imagine?

04:42.448 --> 04:44.867
I know the pressure you're under
is tremendous.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.954
The need for all that secrecy
is bound to put anyone on edge.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.710
One could argue he's the reason
we have all this.

04:53.793 --> 04:58.464
And he could just as easily
be the reason it all goes away.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.322
Does this belong to you?

06:48.366 --> 06:50.660
Don't touch.

07:23.442 --> 07:26.320
You could join
them if you want.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.160
I thought I'd make
breakfast for everyone.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.954
You don't have to.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.205
I know.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.207
I want to.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.549
Since you seem intent

07:46.632 --> 07:48.676
on turning this home of yours

07:48.759 --> 07:51.220
into its own little Eden,

07:51.304 --> 07:55.391
we should talk about
the serpent living amongst us.

07:55.474 --> 07:57.101
I agree.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.478
I was surprised
you let him stay so quickly.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.190
No. I was referring
to your sister.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.692
She's bound to see some
things she shouldn't,

08:04.775 --> 08:06.527
especially with
the first mass coming up.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.904
I've set ground rules.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.907
She won't be a problem.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.909
But what about Frater E.D.?

08:12.992 --> 08:14.702
We carefully chose
everyone here,

08:14.785 --> 08:16.704
trying to achieve a
certain harmony...

08:16.787 --> 08:21.209
Are these your misgivings,
or your husband's?

08:21.292 --> 08:23.419
We have talked
about this.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.296
- It's not the same.
- It's exactly the same.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.923
Our brother has journeyed

08:27.006 --> 08:28.925
as far as a man's
faith can take him.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.718
I need to assess the
truth of his claims,

08:30.801 --> 08:34.931
and will not be limited
by another's fears.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.307
The house should
still have a say

08:36.390 --> 08:37.933
in whether or not
he's allowed to stay.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.187
You've made
a bit of a mess.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.442
We agreed.

08:46.525 --> 08:48.110
So they shall.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.948
When the time is right,
we'll put it to a vote.

08:52.031 --> 08:57.119
You feel the need
to remain in control,

08:57.203 --> 08:59.413
but you need to let go.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.126
After all...

09:04.210 --> 09:08.256
I am your Magus.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.136
It's like I'm living back
with Virgil...

09:14.220 --> 09:15.638
being given all these rules,

09:15.721 --> 09:17.306
constantly being told
what to do.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.475
I'm sure that's very
aggravating for you.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.648
I knew you
would understand.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.484
That's why I thought maybe you'd
be willing to talk to her.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.992
What?

09:36.075 --> 09:38.786
I've never seen
that car here before.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.456
So? What do you think?

09:42.540 --> 09:44.292
For the last time,

09:44.375 --> 09:47.295
I'm not gonna go
against Susan on this.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.630
You're her sister.

09:49.714 --> 09:53.342
God, seems like all you do
is listen to other people.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.512
Susan... your Magus.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.807
She also seems to hang
on his every word.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.350
I know what you're
trying to do.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.560
What?

10:02.643 --> 10:03.728
Getting dolled
up like that,

10:03.811 --> 10:05.062
trying to make me jealous.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.355
It's not gonna work.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.149
Who says I did
all this for you?

10:08.232 --> 10:10.151
It's for all the
new military boys.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.361
I thought I'd make a
good first impression.

10:13.612 --> 10:14.822
You know we're
at war, right?

10:14.905 --> 10:16.490
Yeah, so?

10:16.574 --> 10:19.201
So stockings
are rationed.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.414
You're gonna offend
the very people

10:23.497 --> 10:25.374
you're trying to impress.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.745
Hello, ma'am.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.747
My name is Richard Onsted.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.082
I'm a friend of Marisol.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.586
I'd like to speak
with her father, please.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.305
- You want me to sit?
- Yes.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.768
Okay. Uh, are you going
to go get him, or...?

11:25.851 --> 11:28.604
Yes, yes...

11:31.857 --> 11:36.278
There is... no grace.

11:36.362 --> 11:40.282
There is... no guilt.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.493
This is the law.

11:42.576 --> 11:47.373
Do what thou wilt.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.504
Tell me...

11:53.587 --> 11:56.257
what preceded your vision?

11:58.259 --> 12:01.637
I was standing on the edge
of the abyss.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.811
There were only two roads open
to me.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.859
<i>I chose the more difficult.</i>

12:18.863 --> 12:21.907
<i>And that is
when the angel appeared?</i>

12:22.908 --> 12:26.954
Three days and three nights,
nothing came.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.332
The world was silent,

12:30.416 --> 12:33.627
but my mind was as loud as ever.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.509
And on the fourth?

12:40.593 --> 12:44.722
<i>An angel of
fire appeared to me.</i>

12:45.764 --> 12:47.683
<i>Told me its name.</i>

12:48.642 --> 12:51.812
<i>Filled me with its power.</i>

12:51.896 --> 12:56.358
And I knew peace
for the first time in my life.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.944
And then what?

12:59.945 --> 13:03.991
As quickly as it came,
it disappeared.

13:05.326 --> 13:09.371
Left me engulfed
in an unquenchable rage.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.793
I need to see it again.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.504
I need you to help me.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.923
- I am trying.
- Well, try harder.

13:19.006 --> 13:23.052
I want you to go further back.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.682
Before the working itself.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.018
Why?

13:31.101 --> 13:33.229
Sometimes...

13:33.312 --> 13:36.232
...the revelations are more

13:36.315 --> 13:39.276
than just through ritual,

13:39.360 --> 13:43.656
but through the experiences
leading up to it.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.366
Drawing blood

13:45.449 --> 13:47.868
from the sigil...

13:49.495 --> 13:51.372
...reactivates its power.

13:51.455 --> 13:52.706
It's not working.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.375
Keep focused.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.378
Tell me what happened
to you in Tangier.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.506
Stop!

14:01.840 --> 14:03.801
I sense we are close.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.765
I'm as far away
as I've ever been.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.754
In a report
from our man on the scene,

15:21.837 --> 15:23.714
Joseph Collins comes to us from
Crossville internment camp

15:23.797 --> 15:24.965
near Knoxville, Tennessee.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.343
He interviewed
Colonel James Allen.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.511
Colonel Allen describes our
German and Italian POWs...

15:31.722 --> 15:32.890
Psst.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.642
This is for Mr. Parsons.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.519
Apparently I'm no longer
authorized to go in there.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.897
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, Private.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.400
Is Braxton here yet?

15:44.652 --> 15:45.986
Tell me when he arrives.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.906
- How?
- Use the intercom.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.700
And what'd I tell you
about those stockings?

15:53.661 --> 15:55.704
I'm sorry if I offended you.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.853
Ugh. That's
his wife's sister.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.624
Oh, that's okay.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.585
I have a whole day of work
in front of me.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.754
We're just coming off our shift.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.636
Richard Onsted,
you were saying?

16:52.720 --> 16:57.474
Yes, I-I was saying I'm sorry
for stopping by unannounced.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.518
- You sure you don't want some?
- No.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.312
Thank you. I wanted
to speak to you in person.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.481
You say you're a
friend of Marisol's?

17:07.483 --> 17:08.777
Yes, I-I thought

17:08.861 --> 17:11.530
perhaps she would've told you
about me.

17:14.157 --> 17:16.076
Well, in any case,

17:16.160 --> 17:19.121
I've come here
to ask for your blessing.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.125
My blessing?

17:23.208 --> 17:25.461
For Marisol's hand in marriage.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.633
I imagine
you may be a little wary.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.011
I mean,
a stranger comes in here...

17:34.094 --> 17:36.013
Well,

17:36.096 --> 17:37.556
I can assure you,
I run a small...

17:37.639 --> 17:39.850
well, midsize company

17:39.933 --> 17:41.977
called Aerojet, and...

17:43.437 --> 17:45.355
...we've had some
real success,

17:45.439 --> 17:48.025
so rest assured, I-I will be

17:48.108 --> 17:49.818
a good provider.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.529
- Did she send you?
- Marisol?

17:52.613 --> 17:55.783
No. No, that's-that's
not really how it works.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.535
Unless it's different
where you come from.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.623
You see,

18:02.706 --> 18:03.749
i-if I had told her
that I was coming here

18:03.832 --> 18:05.000
to ask for your blessing,

18:05.083 --> 18:06.877
well, then,
the-the whole surprise

18:06.960 --> 18:09.004
of the proposal would be ruined.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.055
Tell you what.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.228
How much is my blessing
worth to you?

18:25.270 --> 18:27.606
Sir?

18:33.111 --> 18:36.740
I wouldn't really feel right

18:36.824 --> 18:39.535
- paying for such a thing.
- Why not?

18:39.618 --> 18:41.411
You come into my home,
bragging about running

18:41.495 --> 18:43.205
- a midsize company and all that.
- Sir,

18:43.288 --> 18:44.581
I love your daughter very much.

18:44.665 --> 18:45.874
I don't have a daughter.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.043
Marisol is dead to me.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.087
And you will be, too,

18:50.170 --> 18:52.214
if you don't get out
of my house.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.431
Hang on.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.767
It's okay. This
clearly was a bad idea.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.936
No, I need to ask a favor.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.730
Could you give this
to Marisol for me

19:08.814 --> 19:11.066
next time you see her?

19:11.149 --> 19:13.944
I've enlisted, and I'll
be shipping out soon.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.696
Ask her to pray for me.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.447
Matias.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.582
They're letting me stay.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.586
Don't know how long for.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.963
Seems Jack still bears a grudge.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.507
And what of Patty?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.885
Not a follower yet.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.970
Thank goodness.

19:40.053 --> 19:43.599
Susan is lost to me,
but Patty could still be saved.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.727
She's young and impressionable.

19:46.810 --> 19:49.146
I fear for what could happen.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.774
I know it must be difficult

19:52.858 --> 19:54.484
keeping up this lie,

19:54.568 --> 19:58.488
but you must
somehow persevere.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.616
On my urging,

20:00.699 --> 20:03.493
the D.A. has held off
filing charges against you

20:03.577 --> 20:06.496
so long as you prove
helpful to my cause.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.207
H-How, exactly?

20:09.291 --> 20:11.501
Well, you can start

20:11.585 --> 20:15.505
by giving me the names
and personal details

20:15.589 --> 20:17.633
of everyone living there.

20:19.885 --> 20:23.513
The Church wields
a great deal of power

20:23.597 --> 20:24.806
out in the world,

20:24.890 --> 20:26.224
but inside the walls
of that house,

20:26.308 --> 20:29.645
its powers are limited.
I need ammunition.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.274
What if I'm caught?

20:34.358 --> 20:36.693
Voted out of the house?

20:36.777 --> 20:40.238
Well, you owe a debt
for your crimes.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.533
Not just to me, but to society,

20:43.617 --> 20:47.955
so if you cannot fulfill
the task that I have given you,

20:48.038 --> 20:51.708
then prison is the only way
that debt can be paid.

20:51.792 --> 20:55.754
You must do whatever
you can to win Jack

20:55.837 --> 20:57.881
and the others over.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.346
Based on the size of the missile

21:04.429 --> 21:06.056
and the resulting explosion,

21:06.139 --> 21:08.642
we've estimated the payload
to be about one ton.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.769
But this footage is at
least six months old,

21:10.852 --> 21:13.021
so who knows how close they are
to having a working prototype.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.856
But now that we have this film,

21:14.940 --> 21:17.025
you could produce your
own version of the V-2.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.610
Hypothetically, we could build

21:18.694 --> 21:20.195
a long-range missile
to match Von Braun's,

21:20.278 --> 21:22.364
but with just
this film to go on,

21:22.447 --> 21:24.032
one major issue remains.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.701
We can't see what's
on the inside.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.244
We have no idea
what fuel they're using,

21:27.327 --> 21:28.662
the guidance system,

21:28.745 --> 21:30.163
how they're controlling
the combustion.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.874
- We'd need more time.
- No, we don't have it.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.043
This war is gonna be
won on sheer firepower.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.837
You come up short,
we come up short.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.714
There is one thing
that'd help push us along.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.007
Name it.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.717
A meeting with the POW
who stole the footage.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.802
A man who's been inside

21:43.885 --> 21:45.595
Von Braun's operation
is bound to have seen things

21:45.679 --> 21:46.888
that would be invaluable

21:46.972 --> 21:48.765
- to our team.
- He's still being debriefed

21:48.849 --> 21:50.767
by Army Intelligence.
I can pass along

21:50.851 --> 21:52.602
- any information...
- With all due respect, General,

21:52.686 --> 21:53.937
for what we need,
I doubt they'd even know

21:54.021 --> 21:55.397
the right questions to ask.

21:58.358 --> 22:00.777
- How's it going, Walter?
- Great.

22:00.861 --> 22:04.281
Not only will this mass harness
the power of the group,

22:04.364 --> 22:06.283
but we'll also harness
the power of the elements.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.617
Air,

22:07.701 --> 22:11.872
earth, fire and water.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.875
Assuming we can get someone
to fix the fountain.

22:31.349 --> 22:34.019
Can I help you with something?

22:34.102 --> 22:35.771
What are you doing here?

22:35.854 --> 22:37.773
Who are you?

22:39.733 --> 22:41.777
What's going on?

22:43.236 --> 22:44.946
I think someone's watching me.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.114
Who?

22:51.036 --> 22:52.913
Keep staring.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.290
You're not gonna find
the answers.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.125
That food's for the people

22:57.209 --> 22:58.293
who live here.

22:58.376 --> 23:00.295
You still don't get it, do you?

23:00.378 --> 23:02.255
I was never gonna hurt you
with that plane.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.299
I was trying
to help you wake up.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.676
From what?

23:06.760 --> 23:09.179
"Awake from a dream,
the truth is known:

23:09.262 --> 23:11.431
"awake from waking.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.809
The truth is: The Unknown."

24:39.978 --> 24:41.855
Who are <i>you?</i>

24:41.938 --> 24:44.149
Who are <i>you?</i>

24:45.150 --> 24:47.194
I work with Jack.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.713
I'll get him.

25:11.801 --> 25:14.012
Good morning.

25:14.095 --> 25:15.764
Morning.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.772
Look at that. Look at that!

25:23.855 --> 25:26.107
- Ready?
- Have you lost your mind?

25:26.191 --> 25:27.943
What are they all
doing in there?

25:28.026 --> 25:31.112
What I do in the privacy of
my own home is my business.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.156
Your business?
What about our business?

25:33.240 --> 25:35.450
We're gonna be
late. Come on.

25:48.546 --> 25:50.757
Wonder who's
behind this?

25:50.840 --> 25:52.509
I have an idea.

26:24.207 --> 26:26.126
What's he saying?

26:26.209 --> 26:28.461
He speaks of another POW

26:28.545 --> 26:31.339
who killed himself
by drinking

26:31.423 --> 26:32.799
rocket fuel.

26:32.882 --> 26:35.468
Ask him if he died instantly.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.846
Or if it was
more prolonged.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.015
Come on,
it's important.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.519
Did he foam at the
mouth or vomit?

26:44.602 --> 26:46.313
What did the fuel
smell like?

26:46.396 --> 26:48.189
- Was it colored or clear?
- You don't need

26:48.273 --> 26:49.524
to antagonize
the poor guy.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.359
He nearly died
getting us that film.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.902
That's right.
And the Germans

26:52.986 --> 26:55.196
have an entire compound
filled with slave labor

26:55.280 --> 26:56.406
to build their rockets.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.533
We just have the people
in this room.

26:58.616 --> 27:00.160
Is that meant
to be inspiring?

27:00.243 --> 27:02.203
We need to level
the playing field.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.997
Now, ask him.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.291
Okay.

27:12.922 --> 27:15.425
That you, Richie?

27:15.508 --> 27:17.510
Hope you worked up
an appetite.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.512
We're all hot
for first ladies.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.514
That's spare ribs <i>and</i> potatoes.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.391
Got the recipe from Frank.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.935
Don't worry, it's one
he cooks at home.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.564
Awful quiet.

27:29.647 --> 27:31.566
Work stuff got you down?

27:31.649 --> 27:33.902
No, it's not that.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.029
I have something for you.

27:36.112 --> 27:37.405
Oh.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.200
Your brother asked me
to give you this.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.579
He's about
to ship off, and...

27:44.662 --> 27:46.581
wanted you to pray for him.

27:46.664 --> 27:48.875
Since you and he
aren't talking.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.213
I don't understand.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.465
How did he find you?

27:55.548 --> 27:57.175
He didn't.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.386
I found him.

27:59.469 --> 28:01.429
You keep a family photo
in your vanity...

28:01.513 --> 28:03.223
How dare you, Richard.

28:03.306 --> 28:05.475
- Sneaking around my back, checking into me?
- I wasn't.

28:05.558 --> 28:08.186
- When are you gonna start trusting me?
- I do.

28:10.188 --> 28:13.024
I went there to ask your father
for his blessing.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.985
We've been together
for two years.

28:18.154 --> 28:20.115
And I'm ready
to take the next step,

28:20.198 --> 28:22.283
but it seems wrong
without knowing anything

28:22.367 --> 28:23.952
about your family.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.996
I'm sorry. I-I had no idea
your father was so angry.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.998
You never even talk
about him.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.583
Why do you think that is?

28:30.667 --> 28:32.919
- I don't know!
- If there's things about my past

28:33.002 --> 28:35.255
I do not tell you,
<i>maybe</i> there's a reason.

28:35.338 --> 28:36.756
But why?

28:40.176 --> 28:43.179
I love you. I want to know
everything about you.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.641
No. You don't.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.145
What happened?
What did you do?

28:50.228 --> 28:52.272
Why do you assume it
was something <i>I</i> did?

28:52.355 --> 28:54.649
Look, I get it.
If I had grown up there,

28:54.732 --> 28:57.026
I would have left, too.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.521
I know how you feel.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.316
I highly doubt that.

29:36.399 --> 29:38.693
You feel powerless.

29:38.776 --> 29:40.987
Alone and abandoned.

29:41.070 --> 29:45.533
Afraid no one loves you
because you're not worth loving.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.369
Where the hell did you
come up with that?

29:48.453 --> 29:51.331
Wouldn't you like to know?

29:51.414 --> 29:53.708
What we're doing
here is a threat to Jack's career.

29:53.791 --> 29:55.210
For all his ambitions,

29:55.293 --> 29:57.504
Frater J.P.
is held back by fear.

29:57.587 --> 30:01.549
Fear of loss, abandonment,
failure, love.

30:01.633 --> 30:05.178
But does his fear mean
you must limit yourself?

30:05.261 --> 30:08.181
No, I suppose it doesn't.

30:08.264 --> 30:11.434
But I don't think Jack
can handle sharing me.

30:13.269 --> 30:16.189
Did you know he'd been
recording all this stuff?

30:19.359 --> 30:21.402
So crazy.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.572
Collecting everyone's
darkest secrets.

30:31.621 --> 30:34.541
You're gonna want to
hear this one, too.

30:40.129 --> 30:42.632
I'll go outside
and keep a lookout.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.568
Jack was the
key to my liberation,

31:01.651 --> 31:03.111
just like you said.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.779
How?

31:04.862 --> 31:07.240
By putting me in that
plane, he gave me my ticket out.

31:07.323 --> 31:10.660
I never would have been able
to leave my old life.

31:10.743 --> 31:14.080
I never would have seen
my angel without him.

31:14.163 --> 31:17.250
I've come back, so he
could help me see it again.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.252
What preceded your vision?

31:19.335 --> 31:22.088
I was standing
on the edge of the abyss.

31:22.171 --> 31:24.757
There were only
two roads across.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.468
I chose the more difficult.

31:27.552 --> 31:31.681
And I knew peace
for the first time in my life.

31:34.559 --> 31:37.770
So? You gonna
tell everyone?

31:39.355 --> 31:41.107
Yeah, I didn't tell you

31:41.190 --> 31:43.693
till I'd listened
to them all, either.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.614
That's why it's so silly

31:47.697 --> 31:51.409
you and Susan keep trying
to exclude me.

31:51.492 --> 31:53.828
I already know everything.

32:23.441 --> 32:27.153
I should've known you'd be
the one who'd fix it.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.948
Just trying to be
a good houseguest.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.536
Hey, uh, what did you mean
the other night

32:35.620 --> 32:39.707
when you were talking about...
waking up from waking?

32:39.791 --> 32:41.668
Are you awake now?

32:41.751 --> 32:43.211
Yeah.

32:43.294 --> 32:45.338
No. You're not.

32:45.421 --> 32:47.507
You used to be
the man who believed

32:47.590 --> 32:49.884
- we could fly to the Moon.
- I still believe that.

32:49.967 --> 32:52.679
- Eventually.
- Eventually?

32:52.762 --> 32:55.431
Eh. I'm in the middle
of a war right now

32:55.515 --> 32:58.559
- I'm not sure I can win.
- "The price of existence is eternal war.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.603
Only those who fear
shall fail."

33:03.690 --> 33:06.359
Maybe Crowley's words
aren't enough for you tonight.

33:06.442 --> 33:09.487
Maybe... you need
stronger medicine.

33:34.011 --> 33:38.433
One for me and one for you.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.601
Is that what
I think it is?

33:40.685 --> 33:43.479
Uh-huh. A bridge
to the divine.

33:43.563 --> 33:46.691
It'll take away your pain,
your doubts, your fears.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.904
Like water extinguishing
the fire inside of you.

33:54.490 --> 33:56.451
Is it dangerous?

33:56.534 --> 33:59.328
Since when do you
care about that?

34:03.750 --> 34:05.960
Only if you take too much.

34:06.043 --> 34:07.920
Now, you ready?

34:09.839 --> 34:11.507
Ah!

34:27.940 --> 34:31.444
You've strayed far
from the path, my brother.

34:35.864 --> 34:37.867
I've missed you.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.330
You're getting better.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.331
Am I?

35:25.414 --> 35:26.499
You need to practice more.

35:26.582 --> 35:28.626
Here. Like this.

35:41.764 --> 35:44.183
I want there to be
a house vote

35:44.267 --> 35:46.561
on Frater E.D. tonight.

35:48.479 --> 35:51.148
I finished my evaluation.

35:51.232 --> 35:55.236
He's come back
even more broken than before.

36:08.624 --> 36:09.792
There you go, doll.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.738
You're not really here.

36:40.239 --> 36:42.241
Beg your pardon?

36:42.325 --> 36:47.747
Last time I did drugs with
Ernest, I walked on the Moon.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.249
Now I'm seeing
Aleister Crowley.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.251
Mm.

36:52.335 --> 36:55.421
A brilliant mind
can conjure many things,

36:55.504 --> 36:58.132
but I can assure you,
I am not one of them.

36:58.215 --> 37:01.177
- Girl, more tea?
- Yes?

37:11.187 --> 37:12.772
Are you following me?

37:12.855 --> 37:16.108
You're a very difficult man
to find...

37:16.192 --> 37:18.110
alone.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.196
I don't understand.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.283
I am not here in America

37:24.367 --> 37:26.285
as the Great Beast.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.829
Shh.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.709
I am here

37:33.793 --> 37:37.672
on behalf of king and country.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.633
So it's true that you work
for British Intelligence?

37:40.716 --> 37:43.135
Yes.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.721
And... no.

37:46.889 --> 37:50.810
This is the dawn
of a new aeon.

37:50.893 --> 37:54.313
None of us can stand
on the sidelines,

37:54.397 --> 37:58.234
especially those of us
with the power

37:58.317 --> 38:00.695
to bend the world
to our will.

38:00.778 --> 38:03.322
- So, um...
- Here you go.

38:06.325 --> 38:08.536
Order up!

38:08.619 --> 38:10.705
What exactly are you doing here?

38:10.788 --> 38:12.707
I come with a warning.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.835
My German contacts
have informed me

38:15.918 --> 38:17.837
that the aeronautics industry

38:17.920 --> 38:21.549
in Los Angeles
has been deeply compromised.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.676
What?

38:23.759 --> 38:26.721
Don't be a fucking dolt.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.848
Surely you realize

38:28.931 --> 38:32.435
that our enemies will stop
at nothing to win this war.

38:32.518 --> 38:35.688
You must keep a watchful eye
on all those around you.

38:35.771 --> 38:39.525
If you sense that anyone at all
is not who they seem,

38:39.608 --> 38:43.487
I want you to contact me here.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.616
Ask for M. Therion.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.583
I should tell you

38:55.666 --> 38:59.211
that people
in the military have asked me

38:59.295 --> 39:01.464
to pass along any information

39:01.547 --> 39:03.466
that I have
about your whereabouts.

39:03.549 --> 39:07.428
My presence here requires
total secrecy,

39:07.511 --> 39:10.765
for your... safety and mine.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.933
They seemed very intent.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.310
Well, then I suppose

39:14.393 --> 39:16.437
you should ask yourself,

39:16.520 --> 39:18.898
who do you truly serve?

39:18.981 --> 39:22.735
Your government
or your master?

39:22.818 --> 39:24.820
All right.

39:25.988 --> 39:27.865
But I can't see why

39:27.948 --> 39:30.826
the Nazis would be targeting me
or my team.

39:30.910 --> 39:32.912
We have yet
to come up with something

39:32.995 --> 39:35.247
even remotely worth stealing.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.833
Modesty doesn't become you,
Frater J.P.

39:40.503 --> 39:43.756
With the war machine
carrying out your will,

39:43.839 --> 39:46.926
you are far more powerful

39:47.009 --> 39:48.677
than you realize.

39:57.895 --> 39:59.480
Read it.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.983
"RAF carried out an attack

40:03.067 --> 40:04.944
"on Peenemunde
in the middle of the night,

40:05.027 --> 40:07.321
"laying to waste what
Allied intelligence believed

40:07.404 --> 40:09.281
to be a secret
Nazi weapons facility"?

40:09.365 --> 40:11.283
- This is huge.
- It's bigger than huge.

40:11.367 --> 40:15.454
The Nazis have been pushed back,
which means now it's our moment

40:15.538 --> 40:17.998
to make a giant leap forward.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.835
That's the chemical the Nazis
have been experimenting with.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.628
How do you know?

40:22.711 --> 40:26.507
The POW said his compatriot died
stinking of rotten fish.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.009
Guess what aniline
smells like.

40:29.093 --> 40:32.012
Let's get to work.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.306
I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

40:34.390 --> 40:36.308
Moving the Agape

40:36.392 --> 40:38.310
into my house
is paying off already.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.854
Look what I just manifested.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.856
You think
<i>you</i> made the bombing happen?

40:41.939 --> 40:43.691
I think we
needed a level

40:43.774 --> 40:46.527
playing field,
and now, as if by magic...

40:46.610 --> 40:49.405
Are you really sure
we should even be celebrating?

40:49.488 --> 40:53.534
If we did this to them, imagine
what they might do to us.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.871
This meeting is called to order.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.622
Hold on.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.542
This is a house vote, right?

41:01.625 --> 41:03.377
And I live here.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.879
Patty.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.881
Let her.

41:06.964 --> 41:11.135
We can't claim to be a democracy
if some voices are ignored.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.389
In fact,

41:15.472 --> 41:16.765
I think she should be allowed

41:16.849 --> 41:18.559
to participate
in everything we do.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.895
It's clearly what she wants.

41:20.978 --> 41:23.480
And who are we
to impede the will of another?

41:31.697 --> 41:34.033
Back to the matter at hand.

41:34.116 --> 41:37.745
All those in favor
of allowing Frater E.D. to stay?

41:37.828 --> 41:40.456
As... Magus,

41:40.539 --> 41:42.958
I wanted to believe

41:43.042 --> 41:48.380
Frater E.D. had come back
to us a true prophet.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.382
Yet, I fear the source

41:50.466 --> 41:53.761
of his revelations
are not divine,

41:53.844 --> 41:57.097
so much... as chemical.

41:57.181 --> 42:00.559
Doesn't Master Crowley defend
the use of narcotics

42:00.643 --> 42:02.978
to open one's mind?

42:03.062 --> 42:04.939
Why should our brother
be chastised?

42:05.022 --> 42:06.482
I'm not chastising him.

42:06.565 --> 42:08.776
Frater E.D. is free
to do as he wishes,

42:08.859 --> 42:10.402
as is everyone in this room.

42:10.486 --> 42:13.113
It is simply
a question of truth.

42:14.865 --> 42:17.785
Do we wish
to have a man living amongst us

42:17.868 --> 42:21.455
who could keep
such a thing secret?

42:21.538 --> 42:24.833
I don't think any of us
could claim to not have secrets.

42:29.672 --> 42:31.590
Whatever that
boy's been through,

42:31.674 --> 42:33.676
he's one of us.

42:34.843 --> 42:36.845
And he's already pitching in.

42:51.527 --> 42:53.612
He extended a hand

42:53.696 --> 42:55.155
to me when I was lost.

42:55.239 --> 42:57.283
Shouldn't we
do the same?

43:17.219 --> 43:19.179
Welcome home.

43:21.557 --> 43:24.143
However,
there are...

43:24.226 --> 43:25.811
conditions.

43:25.894 --> 43:29.148
You came to me seeking guidance.

43:29.231 --> 43:31.191
But how can I help
if you continue

43:31.275 --> 43:34.987
to hide from who you truly are?

43:36.280 --> 43:39.783
The narcotic
numbs your pain.

43:39.867 --> 43:42.745
But you must
confront it head-on.

43:47.916 --> 43:50.502
Write down the truth
of what happened to you

43:50.586 --> 43:53.047
and cure yourself
of this delusion.

43:56.091 --> 43:58.719
I don't need to be cured.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.721
I have attained the knowledge

44:00.804 --> 44:02.848
in conversation
with my holy guardian angel.

44:02.931 --> 44:04.892
I saw it with my own
fucking eyes!

44:04.975 --> 44:08.687
There can be no room for doubt.

44:08.771 --> 44:12.816
Your mind must be pure.

44:14.151 --> 44:16.737
It's the only thing that
keeps my anger in check.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.031
If you want to remain...

44:21.992 --> 44:24.620
...this is
the requirement.

44:40.803 --> 44:43.764
<i>There are
rituals of the elements</i>

44:43.847 --> 44:46.558
and feasts of the times.

44:46.642 --> 44:49.770
A feast for the Supreme Ritual,

44:49.853 --> 44:51.605
and a feast
for the gods.

44:51.688 --> 44:54.274
A feast for fire and
a feast for water,

44:54.358 --> 44:56.068
a feast for life

44:56.151 --> 44:59.613
and a greater feast for death.

44:59.696 --> 45:02.825
<i>A feast every day
in your hearts</i>

45:02.908 --> 45:05.577
<i>for the joy of my rapture</i>

45:05.661 --> 45:08.997
<i>and pleasure
of uttermost delight.</i>

45:55.752 --> 45:57.129
For all his ambitions,

45:57.212 --> 46:00.257
Frater J.P. is held back
by fear.

46:02.259 --> 46:06.680
Fear of loss,
abandonment, failure, love.

46:06.763 --> 46:11.018
But does his fear mean
you must limit yourself?

46:11.101 --> 46:15.272
No, I suppose it doesn't.

46:15.355 --> 46:18.901
<i>But I don't think
Jack can handle sharing me.</i>

46:20.068 --> 46:23.155
You ready to go inside?

46:23.238 --> 46:26.033
I think we've limited ourselves
for long enough.

46:31.413 --> 46:34.249
We can do it
together.

46:56.021 --> 46:58.774
Is this the sort of
information you're looking for?

47:03.987 --> 47:06.073
For now.
