WEBVTT

00:08.968 --> 00:10.302
Hell yeah.

00:10.386 --> 00:12.012
- No fucking way.
- Fairfax Career Day.

00:12.096 --> 00:14.014
I was always just planning
on inheriting Oy Vape,

00:14.098 --> 00:16.058
but wellness and crystals,

00:16.142 --> 00:18.227
now that's a combo
you just can't ignore.

00:18.310 --> 00:19.478
- Sky's the limit, bruh!
- Ooh.

00:19.562 --> 00:21.647
Like, obviously, I'm down
to get my Mark Cuban on

00:21.731 --> 00:24.024
in the NBA,
but I also see a world

00:24.108 --> 00:26.110
where I'm making beats
in my mama's basement!

00:26.193 --> 00:29.029
Wait. You guys see
Off-Brian needs an intern?

00:29.113 --> 00:30.781
Ooh, my vision board
is coming to life

00:30.865 --> 00:32.324
right before my very eyes.

00:32.408 --> 00:33.617
- Oh, hell yeah!
- Nice.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.702
Man, y'all are tripping.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.287
Off-Brian's fuckin' goon squad.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.913
Homeboy's making fits
out of trash.

00:37.997 --> 00:40.750
Holy shit!
Girlbossier?

00:40.833 --> 00:43.836
Yo, working for them
could be a forever mood.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.296
What's a Girlbossier?

00:45.379 --> 00:47.214
Hah! Only the most progressive

00:47.298 --> 00:49.049
female-run company of all time.

00:49.133 --> 00:51.844
They use feminism to slay
the patriarchal beauty industry.

00:51.927 --> 00:55.806
I would eat a Wagyu bone-in
rib eye for that internship.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.434
Welcome to Career Day, Fairfax!

00:58.517 --> 01:00.394
So, to prepare you
for the real world...

01:00.478 --> 01:03.564
on the Internet, y'all are
getting your first internships.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.484
Now, if everyone'll
check their phones,

01:06.567 --> 01:09.570
I've sent y'all an app
called FaceScanTern.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.322
When I say so,
fire that ish up

01:11.405 --> 01:12.948
and the facial
recognition software

01:13.032 --> 01:14.366
I took out
a second mortgage for

01:14.450 --> 01:16.243
will assign your ass
to a company.

01:16.327 --> 01:18.329
It's goin' down for real in

01:18.412 --> 01:20.289
three... two... one...

01:20.372 --> 01:22.541
scan!

01:22.625 --> 01:24.210
Yes!

01:24.293 --> 01:26.128
I'm triggered.

01:26.212 --> 01:27.797
The fuck?

01:27.880 --> 01:29.632
Holy cow.

01:29.715 --> 01:32.218
Off-Brian?
I'm that bitch!

01:44.188 --> 01:45.981
- [

01:57.952 --> 02:00.204
OMG! Dope <i>and</i> tasteful?

02:00.287 --> 02:02.498
That's, like,
the hardest combo to pull off.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.625
How the fuck did I end up
at a makeup company?

02:04.708 --> 02:06.794
What am I, my mom?
My sister?

02:06.877 --> 02:08.420
My other sister?!

02:10.506 --> 02:12.132
Who the shit is that?

02:12.216 --> 02:15.553
Aleesia Bennet.
CEO and founder of Girlbossier.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.471
She's like
if Kate Middleton, AOC,

02:17.555 --> 02:18.931
and the moon were one person.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.976
You must be our strong,
independent interns

02:22.059 --> 02:23.936
from Fairfax Middle School.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.437
Shit yes, we are!

02:25.521 --> 02:29.650
Derica? You'll be helping us
in... the mail room!

02:29.733 --> 02:32.570
Oh, yay, mail room.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.155
And Benny?
You'll be working in...

02:35.239 --> 02:37.157
our test kitchen!

02:37.241 --> 02:39.660
Thank God. I'm starving.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.453
Starving to change the world.

02:41.537 --> 02:43.998
<i>Welcome to the house</i>
<i>that juice built.</i>

02:44.081 --> 02:45.332
Here's your cubicle.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.501
So what you're going to do is...

02:47.585 --> 02:50.296
Let me guess. Uh, input
this shit into that shit?

02:50.379 --> 02:52.840
Perfect. Just like
my biological children,

02:52.923 --> 02:54.800
you barely need me.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.303
Huh?

02:57.386 --> 03:00.723
"Truman Clark, please report
- to the AR/
- VR room fo..." What?

03:00.806 --> 03:04.143
Orienta... Homie didn't say
anything about orientation.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.520
Bye, Mom! Love you!

03:06.604 --> 03:08.731
Okay.
This is it, Dale.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.317
This is your chance to prove to
the gang gang once and for all

03:11.400 --> 03:13.485
that you can
serve lewks, too.

03:13.569 --> 03:14.820
Ah!

03:14.904 --> 03:17.448
Dale? Golden Dorito Dale?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.199
Bri-Dawg! Hey, pal.

03:19.283 --> 03:22.953
You're my intern?
Aw, the motherfucking chances!

03:23.037 --> 03:25.372
Come on in,
ya fuckin' fart cupper.

03:25.456 --> 03:26.749
Yo, was that your mom?

03:26.832 --> 03:28.542
Man, she is hot.

03:29.752 --> 03:31.837
Welcome to the lab.

03:31.921 --> 03:34.131
I heard Dr. Dre call
his house that once.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.507
Hey, you got time for a tour?

03:35.591 --> 03:37.968
Of course you do,
you're my fuckin' intern.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.179
Huh?

03:41.889 --> 03:42.932
Save yourself.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.224
Ah!

03:45.976 --> 03:49.188
Welcome to our test kitchen,

03:49.271 --> 03:52.900
where every single Girlbossier
product is naturally birthed.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.193
I'm Kellen.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.569
You must be the new intern.

03:55.653 --> 03:56.987
Uh... Benny.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.657
Ooh, that's so urban.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.701
- I love it. Ah!
- Ah! What?

04:02.785 --> 04:05.204
They finally sent us
the Korean cheek structure

04:05.287 --> 04:06.997
we've been begging for.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.123
Are these implants?

04:08.207 --> 04:09.458
Excuse me?

04:09.541 --> 04:11.085
I would never Cardi-butt
this face.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.254
Okay, Mr. Feisty.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.215
If I could just...

04:16.298 --> 04:18.592
Ey, ey, ey, yo!
I'm cis male as hell!

04:20.719 --> 04:22.221
Even the cis can
be beautiful, darling.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.391
Holy Benicio Del Toro.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.892
I'm gorgeous.

04:26.976 --> 04:28.727
Teach me your ways.

04:28.811 --> 04:30.396
- That's it.

04:30.479 --> 04:33.190
And anything for the C-suites
gets hand-delivered ASAP.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.110
Mm-hmm, got it! And when do I
get my one-on-one with Aleesia?

04:36.193 --> 04:37.945
One-on-one with Aleesia?

04:38.028 --> 04:40.990
Girl!

04:41.073 --> 04:42.700
- Ugh.

04:43.742 --> 04:44.910
Ah-ha.

04:44.994 --> 04:48.414
Derica,
you stupid brilliant bitch.

04:52.251 --> 04:55.254
Ey, hold up...

04:55.337 --> 04:57.756
Wait. Okay, Welch's!

04:57.840 --> 04:59.299
This shit clean.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.095
"Augmented reality orientation"?

05:03.178 --> 05:05.389
Damn, Welch's extra as fuck.

05:08.726 --> 05:10.185
Oh, shit.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.021
Wait, this is actually
kind of tight.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.858
"Welcome to Welch's Jams &
Juices Logistics Orientation."

05:15.941 --> 05:18.902
Yup, Daddy's gonna
stretch this one out.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.904
What?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.701
Hey, Big Head.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.244
Cerise?!

05:31.331 --> 05:33.667
Oh. My. God.

05:33.751 --> 05:36.837
Hello? Ms. Bennet?

05:36.920 --> 05:40.632
Ugh! Have you ever seen
more boring faces?

05:40.716 --> 05:43.052
God. It's like,
how many versions

05:43.135 --> 05:45.512
of Emma Stone
does the world need?

05:45.596 --> 05:48.766
Ugh. If only TimothÃ©e Chalamet
had a vagina.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.017
Mm, I'd hit that.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.019
Time out.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.438
Now time in again.
Who are you?

05:54.521 --> 05:57.441
I'm Derica Stratton-Torres

05:57.524 --> 06:00.194
and I fucking love you.
Professionally.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.446
I want to be a world-changing
Girl Boss just like you.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.822
Huh. Do you, now?

06:03.906 --> 06:05.032
Yes, bitch!

06:05.115 --> 06:08.786
I mean, yes,
Ms. Bennet... bitch.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.370
So raw.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.498
So unafraid of <i>authoritay.</i>

06:12.581 --> 06:16.126
What, you think I got
this temporary tattoo of Malala

06:16.210 --> 06:18.545
because she listens
to <i>authoritay?</i>

06:18.629 --> 06:20.339
Game recognize game, gal.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.508
Pouring a little one out
for my girl RBG.

06:23.801 --> 06:26.136
Let's just say
I signed hers,

06:26.220 --> 06:27.471
she signed mine.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.517
Derica, you are... yes.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.893
Hah! I know, right?

06:32.976 --> 06:35.270
Yes to the yas to the yas...!

06:35.354 --> 06:37.397
Jesus F. Christ, finally.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.692
Brooks? Brooks, I found her.

06:40.776 --> 06:44.446
I found the new face
of Girlbossier.

06:44.530 --> 06:45.656
Uh-uh. No.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.866
Hell nah, I'm not playing
this game again.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.327
You traumatized my ass
back at Chernobyl Fest.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.621
And I haven't been able
to drink a J-word since!

06:52.704 --> 06:55.499
Truman. This is different.
You have to believe me.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.959
Believe you?

06:57.042 --> 07:00.170
I believed you when you were
the woman of my dreams.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.839
Then you turned out to be

07:01.922 --> 07:03.423
a crusty-ass,
middle-aged white guy.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.342
Chet and Denise played me,
too.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.844
But I killed them.

07:06.927 --> 07:07.761
- The fuck?!

07:07.845 --> 07:09.471
JK! Ha-ha-ha!

07:09.555 --> 07:11.306
They discontinued
the marketing campaign

07:11.390 --> 07:12.641
after you found them.

07:12.724 --> 07:13.976
I've been stuck
here ever since,

07:14.059 --> 07:16.103
in computer purgatory.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.479
But I'm my own woman now,

07:17.563 --> 07:19.231
and I want to make it up
to you.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.151
Let me take you
on the first date we never had.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.488
Take my hand, snack boi.

07:30.159 --> 07:31.827
Whoa.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.623
It feels so real.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.001
- I hope you're thirsty.
- Wait, wha...

07:40.961 --> 07:42.004
"Boom "]

08:20.626 --> 08:21.960
- Hey, mine!

08:22.044 --> 08:23.629
Man, get your own
damn lip kit!

08:23.712 --> 08:25.797
- Mine, mine, mine!

08:32.012 --> 08:33.639
May I present

08:33.722 --> 08:35.891
- the grand finale...

08:39.436 --> 08:41.313
OMG, AOC.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.440
Don't you love it, Dareeca?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.525
Yeah! Uh, and by the way,

08:45.609 --> 08:46.693
I've been meaning to tell you,

08:46.777 --> 08:49.238
it's actually Der-i-ca.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.366
Oh, God, I love
how outspoken you are,

08:52.449 --> 08:54.576
but we did some focus groups
and "Dareeca"

08:54.660 --> 08:56.870
really makes your
Afro-Latinaness shine.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.414
Right. Yes.
Representation is important.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.792
- Said like a true Girl Boss

09:01.875 --> 09:03.710
changing the effing world!

09:03.794 --> 09:07.464
Oh, look at them
literally looking up to you.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.967
Is it, I don't know,
maybe because

09:10.050 --> 09:13.470
your new makeup line is
officially sold out?!

09:13.553 --> 09:15.889
Eat your butt out,
Kylie Jenner!

09:15.973 --> 09:21.186
Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay!
Ooh, ah, ah-ah!

09:22.813 --> 09:25.315
Who cares if Terry and Brianna
lost their marital bedroom?

09:25.399 --> 09:28.402
Bri-Bri needs a new office.

09:28.485 --> 09:29.987
It's cool their bed
is your desk.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.613
God knows they weren't using it

09:31.697 --> 09:33.490
for anything as sexy
as my ideas.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.701
Look at you workin' the brand.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.160
I'm loving the armpit holes.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.038
Sire, your midday keto shake.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.669
Was there 'nana in there?

09:48.255 --> 09:50.882
You know I'm a "never 'nana!"

09:50.966 --> 09:52.467
now
you've made Dale sick!

09:52.551 --> 09:54.094
- I-I-I'm so sorry, sir!
I-I-I...
- Clean it.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.804
Oh, no, no, no, no,
it's okay, it's okay.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.472
I was gagging at
something else.

09:57.556 --> 10:00.309
Bri-Bri, I have Dolce on line
one. 911 fashion emergency.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.352
Says he's had it up to here
with Gabbana.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.854
Ugh, fine.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.523
Be a doll and
show Dale his workspace.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.026
Whoa. I get to do actual work?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.527
This is such a big deal.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.821
Yeah, it's a big deal
for everyone.

10:12.904 --> 10:16.116
Brian is such a genius,
it's terrifying.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.827
So you can't blame him for
chloroforming insubordinates.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.955
- Chloro-what-ing?
- You know, sleep juice.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.165
Uh...

10:23.248 --> 10:24.791
Even I deserve
to get 'formed sometimes.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.127
And who doesn't love
a surprise nap?

10:27.210 --> 10:29.379
I don't know, I like
to see a nap coming.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.882
So, Brian says you're

10:31.965 --> 10:35.052
"the only living
person who understands him,"

10:35.135 --> 10:36.970
and seeing as you're the one

10:37.054 --> 10:38.847
who inspired him
to start Off-Brian,

10:38.930 --> 10:42.059
he wants you
to paint his portrait.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.644
Paint? Oh, no, I-I can
barely write cursive.

10:46.063 --> 10:49.775
Uh-oh,
somebody got 'formed!

10:49.858 --> 10:51.360
Ah...

10:51.443 --> 10:53.403
- This one. Oh.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.614
This one...

11:00.035 --> 11:01.328
Bam!

11:01.411 --> 11:04.206
He has... the gift.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.171
Mm.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.300
My love! My light! My girl!

11:57.384 --> 11:58.885
How lit are you to star

11:58.969 --> 12:01.221
in Girlbossier's first
Super Bowl commercial?

12:01.304 --> 12:03.807
Oh, litter than
a Yung Polluter trash fire.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.436
It's about time we make the
right to assemble mainstream.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.772
Right? My crystals said
it's gonna to be a-maze.

12:10.856 --> 12:13.567
And we'll get to see
a rough cut

12:13.650 --> 12:15.318
at Girlbossier's first ever

12:15.402 --> 12:18.071
Div-HER-sity Summit, tonight.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.573
Yes, hell yeah.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.283
I know exactly
what to write on this.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.577
Wait, what rhymes with
"peg the patriarchy"?

12:23.660 --> 12:24.619
Honey, no.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.079
We do all that in post.

12:26.163 --> 12:27.372
Who knows what message
will be important

12:27.456 --> 12:28.957
on Super Bowl Sunday?

12:29.040 --> 12:32.127
Mm, I guess righteous today
could be cancellable tomorrow.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.546
You're hilarious!

12:34.629 --> 12:36.298
Dareeca, baby.
Okay, okay, okay,

12:36.381 --> 12:39.551
so, so we-we've just seen you
march from uh, LAX Airport

12:39.634 --> 12:41.678
to the ghetto of um, uh,
of Downtown L.A.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.014
Okay, here we go.
Okay? And-and action.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.516
- No mascara,
no peace!

12:46.600 --> 12:48.518
No gloss, no peace!

12:48.602 --> 12:50.770
No mascara, no peace!

12:50.854 --> 12:52.272
Dare to be you!

12:52.355 --> 12:54.316
Dare to be different!

12:54.399 --> 12:57.402
Dare to be Dareeca!

12:57.486 --> 12:58.653
Thank you, all right,
cut, cut, cut.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.155
Ah, l-l-let's do it again.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.406
Extras, gimme more soul, baby,

13:01.490 --> 13:03.116
- give me more soul, okay.
- Soul?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.910
Uh, Dareeca,
let's lose the glasses.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.369
They're giving her
dead eyes, okay?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.497
Ooh, goddamn.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.832
Loving no glasses.
Oh, now,

13:10.916 --> 13:12.459
now you look like your people.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.085
My "people"?

13:15.921 --> 13:17.130
Oh...

13:19.382 --> 13:20.634
Fuck.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.927
And... action!

13:22.010 --> 13:24.971
No Dareeca...

13:25.055 --> 13:27.349
no peace...

13:27.432 --> 13:29.976
All right, cue-cue the
Scarlett Johansson voiceover.

13:30.060 --> 13:33.230
<i>Girlbossier</i>
<i>is Div-HER-sity.</i>

13:33.313 --> 13:35.482
That's a wrap.
We got it, infants.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.567
Ah, no.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.736
Oh, what's up, DalÃ©?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.446
Hey, split a claw
with me, brah.

13:41.530 --> 13:42.906
Yo, is that my portrait?

13:42.989 --> 13:44.491
Let me see it, playboi.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.743
Oh, you don't want to see this.
It's just the first draft...

13:46.826 --> 13:48.078
so, w-w-when you're
looking at it, just...

13:48.161 --> 13:50.288
- Fucking brilliant.
- Really?

13:50.372 --> 13:52.082
I mean, this could be
at the Tate Modern.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.125
You really see me,
Dale-Dawg.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.878
I already owe you for
inspiring me to leave Hiroki

13:56.962 --> 13:58.797
- and now this?
- Hiroki?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.674
- Oh,Ì§ forget about that guy.
- Right?

14:00.757 --> 14:02.175
Fuck that guy.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.426
Fuckin' bully.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.595
Man, you are validating
my trauma.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.764
Yeah! You know, it's almost
kind of like Hiroki was--

14:07.847 --> 14:09.015
oh, geez, I don't know--

14:09.099 --> 14:10.767
chloroforming your soul?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.853
Dale... are you implying
that there's something wrong

14:13.937 --> 14:15.939
with me 'forming my employees?

14:16.022 --> 14:18.149
Oh, no, it's just...

14:18.233 --> 14:19.442
- Uh...

14:19.526 --> 14:21.653
In Scouts, we learned

14:21.736 --> 14:24.155
it's important
to value your troop.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.533
A-And your employees are
kinda like your troop.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.660
Nah mean?

14:28.743 --> 14:31.162
JK.
Total J.K. Rowling moment.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.414
You are the troop.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.207
You are the star
of the painting, my man.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.876
Wow.
That's fucking deep, my dude.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.337
Ooh, geez,
I'm not feeling so good.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.465
- I think the old lobster
intolerance is acting up.
- Been there, brah.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.551
- Go ahead and use
the master bathroom.
- Uh...

14:44.634 --> 14:46.052
Oh, that looks good.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.805
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.557
- Ah...
- Yo, Derica! Check it...

14:50.640 --> 14:52.851
- Ah!
- Please don't kill me!

14:52.934 --> 14:54.894
Dude, chill. It's me, Benny.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.855
Benny?

14:56.938 --> 15:00.275
Bitch, is that muscle?

15:00.358 --> 15:01.776
Why work out
when you can just contour?

15:01.860 --> 15:03.278
This is contouring?

15:03.361 --> 15:06.489
Turns out contouring is just
a series of Nike swooshes.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.742
I call it "Swoosh Technique."

15:08.825 --> 15:12.078
Now that you're famous, you can
share my gift with the world.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.456
I don't know, Benny.
Shit is problematic.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.750
We just shot a commercial
with Quentin Tarantino...

15:16.833 --> 15:18.543
Did he make a bunch of
white people say the N-word

15:18.627 --> 15:19.669
and then
he called it "artistry"?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.004
I don't think so?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.131
Benny, everyone in charge
was white,

15:23.214 --> 15:25.425
but all the extras were
black and brown.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.053
Ooh. That's that sneaky racism.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.596
Yeah, I didn't even
see it coming.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.349
Aleesia made me the "face"
of Girlbossier,

15:32.432 --> 15:34.351
and gave me the clout score
of my dreams!

15:34.434 --> 15:36.853
Ugh...

15:36.936 --> 15:39.439
Uh. No, I gotta say something.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.609
Aleesia loved me this morning
because I spoke my truth.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.319
Yeah, everybody loves "Truth."

15:44.402 --> 15:46.363
That's what I named
this itchy-ass bronzer.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.156
Yes, Benny!
Truth is power

15:48.239 --> 15:49.366
even when it's uncomfortable.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.700
- Come on!
- Whoa!

15:51.743 --> 15:53.453
Ah...

15:55.288 --> 15:57.540
That was incredible.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.042
More than incredible.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.294
I'm just glad I hooked Weston
up with FaceScanTern.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.505
He watches so many
cologne un-boxings,

16:03.588 --> 16:04.839
I wasn't sure it'd work.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.508
Wait, FaceScanTern was you?

16:06.591 --> 16:08.468
Well, I-I had to say goodbye.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.470
At sunrise tomorrow,
I'm being wiped.

16:10.553 --> 16:11.763
What do you mean?

16:11.846 --> 16:14.307
They're stripping my code
down to a basic bitch AI.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.893
I-I didn't tell you because
I didn't want to ruin today.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.312
So you manipulated me? Again?

16:19.396 --> 16:21.272
You created this whole ruse
to trick me

16:21.356 --> 16:22.857
into saving your ass,
didn't you?

16:22.941 --> 16:24.984
No! Today was real! I promise!

16:25.068 --> 16:27.737
Real?! As real as
these phony-ass goggles.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.906
No, no, Truman, don't!

16:30.865 --> 16:32.826
Fuck this juice.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.497
Dareeca, what are
you doing here?

16:37.580 --> 16:39.958
Old-ass white men.
Damn it, I should've known.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.210
Yo, that shoot was fucked up!

16:42.293 --> 16:44.879
Yeah, dog.
Sneaky racism is still racism.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.881
Your diversity summit
is tonight,

16:46.965 --> 16:48.758
but the more I look around,
the more I realize

16:48.842 --> 16:50.802
I'm the only bitch
with melanin around here.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.346
This room is drowning
in cis white men.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.057
Well,
that's what Mr. Turt is for.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.353
Oh, come on!
The turtle's not even female!

17:00.437 --> 17:03.106
We're on track
to be diverse by 2079.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.733
For now, we've got you.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.651
Eat my dick!

17:06.735 --> 17:08.987
Well, that's not
very Dareeca of you.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.321
Come on.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.115
You know you love
your new life.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.825
You can't do tonight without me.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.243
Oh, we can't?

17:15.326 --> 17:17.579
- She's very excited

17:17.662 --> 17:19.080
to speak tonight.

17:19.164 --> 17:21.666
- Isn't that right, Dareeca?
<i>- Hey, y'all,</i>

17:21.750 --> 17:24.919
<i>I'm Dareeca,</i>
<i>the Afro-Latina!</i>

17:28.882 --> 17:30.592
<i>Hey, Tru! What's up?</i>

17:30.675 --> 17:33.011
Dale! I need advice and
nobody else picked up. I...

17:33.094 --> 17:34.804
Bro, you good?

17:34.888 --> 17:36.347
Yeah. I can't get
into the deets right now,

17:36.431 --> 17:37.682
it's a long short story.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.058
<i>You're right, I don't care.</i>

17:39.142 --> 17:40.685
<i>Anyway, I met this girl</i>
<i>at my internship today,</i>

17:40.769 --> 17:42.353
and I'm trippin' hard, bruh.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.022
Like, emotionally trippin'.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.523
We had this amazing date.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.983
It felt like a dream.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.777
A musical number
and everything.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.820
Musical number? I mean,
if that's not love...

17:50.904 --> 17:52.197
Dale-Dawg.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.532
Just wanted to check in
on your tummers... Hey!

17:54.616 --> 17:55.909
- What the...
- Ah!

17:55.992 --> 17:57.619
And then we kissed.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.454
<i>A TruBoy becomes a TruMan.</i>

17:59.537 --> 18:01.414
- Problem is, she...

18:01.498 --> 18:02.999
low-key trapped me into
spending the day with her

18:03.082 --> 18:06.002
because she's, uh, getting
on a plane and leaving forever.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.505
She must really like you!

18:08.588 --> 18:11.007
What?
What do you mean?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.468
It's like when Trini tricks me
into eating vegetables

18:13.551 --> 18:15.178
by putting them
in the Slipper Cobbler.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.679
She does it because she cares!

18:16.763 --> 18:18.014
- Ah!

18:18.097 --> 18:20.183
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
you little shit!

18:20.266 --> 18:22.477
- Surprise nap time!

18:22.560 --> 18:24.979
- Yah!

18:25.063 --> 18:26.856
I'm melting!

18:28.399 --> 18:30.360
You're saying she tricked me
because she loves me?

18:30.443 --> 18:31.820
Damn. That's real.

18:31.903 --> 18:34.697
<i>Get to</i>
<i>that airport, Truman!</i>

18:41.246 --> 18:42.872
Sup, girl.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.291
Big Head? Oh! You came back!

18:45.375 --> 18:48.670
Come on, Cerise. Let's get
your juicy ass outta here!

18:48.753 --> 18:51.714
<i>Dare to be you!</i>
<i>Dare to be different!</i>

18:51.798 --> 18:53.550
<i>- Dare to be Dareeca!</i>
- Aleesia?

18:53.633 --> 18:54.968
Ugh, what is it?

18:55.051 --> 18:56.219
Look, I'm sorry.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.222
I did some thinking,
and diversity by 2079,

18:59.305 --> 19:00.932
as far away as it is,

19:01.015 --> 19:02.433
it's better than no plan at all.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.061
Well, glad you came around.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.064
We're all fighting
the same human battle.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.066
Yup. All wars matter,

19:10.149 --> 19:11.609
but I gotta pick my battles.

19:11.693 --> 19:12.986
You've given me so much.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.279
I can't let you down now.

19:14.362 --> 19:15.947
Oh, stuff your sorry in a sack.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.824
Now get out there
and show that teleprompter

19:17.907 --> 19:20.326
who's boss... ier.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.583
<i>Okay. You should be</i>
<i>in the mainframe.</i>

19:26.666 --> 19:29.002
<i>Now, you see that folder that</i>
<i>says, "Do not save Cerise"?</i>

19:29.085 --> 19:31.004
<i>All you have to do</i>
<i>is drag it to your phone.</i>

19:36.467 --> 19:37.594
It's working, girl!

19:39.012 --> 19:41.139
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I jinxed it. I jinxed it.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.308
Shit, shit, shit.
Damn it, damn it, come on.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.603
<i>Dare to</i>
<i>be Dareeca.</i>

19:46.686 --> 19:49.355
<i>Dare to be div-HER-se.</i>

19:49.439 --> 19:53.067
<i>Dare to be yo, yo, yo.</i>

19:55.486 --> 19:56.905
Oh, I am honored

19:56.988 --> 19:59.991
to be the woke face
of Girlbossier.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.493
- Thank you, thank you.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.872
Because of women like them,

20:05.955 --> 20:07.457
I've gotten to experience

20:07.540 --> 20:10.251
just how lit
diversity can be.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.046
Wha...

20:13.129 --> 20:14.380
- Ah.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.424
Open up, little man.

20:16.507 --> 20:19.344
Girlbossier dares
to be different...

20:22.680 --> 20:26.017
...which is why
CEO Aleesia Bennet

20:26.100 --> 20:28.895
and our board of directors
have decided

20:28.978 --> 20:32.273
it's time to put our money
where our mouth is.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.317
Um, Devon,
is that on the prompter?

20:34.400 --> 20:38.237
It's time for revolutionary
BIPOC initiatives,

20:38.321 --> 20:40.573
'cause we ain't afraid
to be that bitch!

20:43.159 --> 20:45.119
That's right, we're committing

20:45.203 --> 20:47.205
to full racial equality
in our employees...

20:47.288 --> 20:50.541
- ...70% black- and brown-owned
manufacturers,

20:50.625 --> 20:52.543
and, just to be extra,

20:52.627 --> 20:55.171
Tamale Tuesdays
and a four-day work week.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.509
Where the hell is my Xanax?!

20:59.592 --> 21:01.260
This Karen's about to detonate!

21:01.344 --> 21:02.845
Kaboom, bitch!

21:02.929 --> 21:05.014
And I could not have done this

21:05.098 --> 21:07.684
without Girlbossier CEO,

21:07.767 --> 21:10.436
- my mentor, my sis...

21:10.520 --> 21:11.896
- ...my best friend...
- No!

21:11.980 --> 21:14.440
- Aleesia Bennet!

21:19.153 --> 21:20.655
It's over for you.

21:20.738 --> 21:23.366
Hologram Dareeca is
the future of Girlbossier.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.368
You're right, Aleesia.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.328
I mean, how can
just one face rep

21:27.412 --> 21:30.665
all your beautiful, real,
Girlbossier faces?

21:30.748 --> 21:32.166
I can't!

21:32.250 --> 21:35.169
Which is why I,
and my image,

21:35.253 --> 21:37.755
- are retiring...

21:37.839 --> 21:41.676
...to go back to school
and finish the seventh grade.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.761
- Bitch, I love education.

21:45.888 --> 21:49.851
Hey! You will never be
a Girlbossier, Dareeca.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.770
The irony is,
I already am a Girlbossier.

21:52.854 --> 21:55.231
And it's Der-i-ca,
you bitch.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.818
<i>...why I,</i>
<i>and my image,</i>

21:58.901 --> 22:00.445
<i>are retiring...</i>

22:03.990 --> 22:06.200
W-well, uh, you heard the girl,

22:06.284 --> 22:09.162
and I'm sure the entire
Internet will, too.

22:09.245 --> 22:12.290
Would hate to get
cancelled... again.

22:12.373 --> 22:15.668
Better just, like,
do all the stuff she said.

22:15.752 --> 22:17.712
I'm going to
the bathroom now, to...

22:17.795 --> 22:19.589
drain my white penis.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.759
Oh, and I need six
of y'all fools to quit

22:22.842 --> 22:25.470
by the time I'm back.
Also, I quit.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.232
Ha-ha!

22:42.070 --> 22:43.905
<i>It's not worth the squeeze.</i>

22:43.988 --> 22:45.239
<i>You can meet a real girl.</i>

22:45.323 --> 22:47.533
You are a real girl.

22:47.617 --> 22:48.701
My real girl...

22:48.785 --> 22:49.660
- Ah!

22:49.744 --> 22:51.704
Sick 'em, juice boys.

22:53.247 --> 22:56.000
Cerise...!

22:56.084 --> 22:59.170
No...!

23:02.340 --> 23:04.383
Benny, Brian was... evil.

23:04.467 --> 23:07.428
Dale, I mean this

23:07.512 --> 23:08.930
man, I fuckin' told your ass!

23:09.013 --> 23:10.765
Can we go? I'm not trying
to be late to Honors Beef.

23:11.849 --> 23:13.059
Huh?

23:13.142 --> 23:15.186
- Hello?
<i>- Truman.</i>

23:15.269 --> 23:17.688
Cerise? B... Where are you?

23:17.772 --> 23:19.565
<i>I'm in your phone.</i>

23:20.775 --> 23:22.193
<i>Hey, Big Head.</i>

23:22.276 --> 23:24.862
It worked!

24:11.951 --> 24:13.911
Chirp.
