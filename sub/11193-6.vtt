WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:10.077
P5C-629 is located in the corridor the
Goa'ulds used to reach our solar system.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.121
This is our best platform
for the Seeker Project.

00:13.121 --> 00:18.329
Now, a Goa'uld ship that size should leave
a mark, even at thrust beyond lightspeed.

00:18.242 --> 00:21.112
So we're using the technology
we already possess...

00:23.681 --> 00:25.722
What the hell...?

00:27.001 --> 00:29.042
No-one's due back today.

00:29.082 --> 00:31.789
We have an inbound traveller.
No SG signal code.

00:32.963 --> 00:38.088
<i>Intruder alert.
Inbound traveller is unauthorised.</i>

00:57.006 --> 00:59.046
There was no organic residue,...

00:59.087 --> 01:03.085
...but they did pick up a faint
nuclear signature. Traces of iridium.

01:03.048 --> 01:07.757
That's the radioactive stuff we left
in the Sagan Institute box on Cimmeria.

01:07.688 --> 01:11.388
I wanted it there so it would leave
a very recognisable signature.

01:11.368 --> 01:13.408
- Same stuff?
- Yeah.

01:13.448 --> 01:18.444
Weren't the locals supposed to
give that box to... Thor?

01:18.367 --> 01:20.408
Whoever or whatever he is.

01:20.450 --> 01:23.984
We assume he's a member of the Asgard,
a very advanced culture.

01:23.969 --> 01:26.176
The fact is, we really don't know.

01:26.210 --> 01:28.962
The Asgards must've got the box
and sent an answer.

01:28.969 --> 01:32.055
General, we have to respond
before they leave.

01:32.051 --> 01:35.218
You all know I take great pride
in my title as Mr. Positive.

01:35.212 --> 01:38.165
<i>However, we did destroy
their de-Goa'ulding thing.</i>

01:38.170 --> 01:40.293
Might not they look unkindly on that?

01:40.331 --> 01:42.371
We did that to save Teal'c.

01:42.412 --> 01:46.908
I'm sure the Asgards didn't expect to trap
a friendly Jaffa. They'd understand.

01:51.052 --> 01:53.093
All right. I'll tell you what.

01:53.133 --> 01:57.594
We'll send a probe at 1300 hours.
If everything checks out, you have a go.

01:59.373 --> 02:01.414
Probe proceeding to iris!

02:06.655 --> 02:09.062
The probe should be there... now.

02:15.377 --> 02:18.081
Those wounds have been
caused by staff weapons.

02:20.455 --> 02:21.915
Friend of yours, Teal'c?

02:24.098 --> 02:28.096
<i>Clearly Cimmeria
is no longer safe from the Goa'uld.</i>

02:28.056 --> 02:29.337
Pan right.

02:29.737 --> 02:31.730
That's Gairwyn.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.985
The woman who showed us around.

02:36.300 --> 02:40.213
- She's saying something.
- Turn up the gain on the MALP's Mike.

02:41.259 --> 02:43.299
<i>Please...</i>

02:44.299 --> 02:46.588
<i>The Etins have come.</i>

02:48.381 --> 02:50.123
<i>Please help us.</i>

02:50.180 --> 02:53.216
<i>Please... The Etins have come.</i>

02:53.221 --> 02:55.259
<i>Please help us.</i>

03:55.468 --> 03:58.753
<i>Cimmerians use
the word Etin for Goa'ulds.</i>

03:58.747 --> 04:00.824
Gairwyn said the Etins are there.

04:00.868 --> 04:04.239
For a thousand years
Cimmeria was safe from Goa'uld attack.

04:04.229 --> 04:06.935
Then we show up
and screw up Thor's technology.

04:06.949 --> 04:09.358
The Goa'uld usually send
an advance scout...

04:09.389 --> 04:12.225
...to determine a planet's worth
and vulnerability.

04:12.229 --> 04:15.729
If no scout reports back,
it is a deterrent to invasion.

04:15.711 --> 04:18.084
The point is, sir, the Goa'uld are there...

04:18.110 --> 04:20.779
...and the locals aren't
much of a match for them.

04:20.791 --> 04:26.132
General, if we did screw up their world,
we should help fix it, don't you think?

04:26.031 --> 04:28.071
I understand that.

04:28.112 --> 04:31.315
But let me play devil's advocate
for a moment here.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.351
<i>It's not our world.</i>

04:33.393 --> 04:35.848
Is it really any of our concern?

04:35.874 --> 04:40.582
The destruction of the hammer device
to save my life may have caused this.

04:40.512 --> 04:42.886
If so, I am responsible.

04:43.394 --> 04:46.064
General, I gave the order.

04:48.074 --> 04:50.363
And I fired the staff at the machine.

04:50.394 --> 04:52.435
And I... was there.

04:56.675 --> 05:00.543
To answer your question, sir,
yes, I think we should be concerned.

05:04.716 --> 05:08.334
All right.
But keep your heads up on this one.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.759
No hostiles in sight, sir.

06:17.324 --> 06:18.783
Holy...

06:21.005 --> 06:23.045
Kids...

06:25.084 --> 06:29.130
<i>Now, that... is no weekend hunting lodge.</i>

06:34.728 --> 06:36.721
Gairwyn!

06:36.768 --> 06:38.891
You returned!

06:38.928 --> 06:41.846
Kendra said you'd come.
She never doubted it.

06:41.848 --> 06:44.683
- What happened?
- We thought it was Ragnorock.

06:44.689 --> 06:47.560
That's the Norse Armageddon.
The end of the world.

06:47.569 --> 06:49.608
There was fire in the heavens.

06:49.649 --> 06:52.521
Five or six bursts in the sky
in a straight line.

06:52.529 --> 06:54.569
But no sound.

06:54.610 --> 06:59.106
Then we heard an evil thunder and
a metal point came through the clouds.

06:59.050 --> 07:01.291
A Goa'uld Hatak.

07:01.331 --> 07:03.372
A pyramid ship.

07:04.531 --> 07:08.826
Kendra knew it was the Etins, even before
the burning and killing started.

07:08.771 --> 07:11.442
Our village is gone,
and most of our farms.

07:11.452 --> 07:14.822
- You said Kendra knew we'd come. How?
- She gave me a box.

07:14.812 --> 07:18.312
She said to fly it through the portaI.
You'd know what it meant.

07:18.293 --> 07:20.535
The cost of sending it was great.

07:20.572 --> 07:22.612
The men who died here?

07:29.495 --> 07:33.242
- My husband and his brothers.
- I'm sorry.

07:37.814 --> 07:39.439
Get under cover.

07:39.495 --> 07:41.370
Teal'c!

08:06.579 --> 08:08.656
Let's go!

09:23.229 --> 09:24.427
Agh!

09:25.788 --> 09:28.658
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.328
Right. Where to?

09:30.389 --> 09:35.846
Well, as a former Goa'uld host, Kendra
would be a help. Can you take us to her?

09:37.230 --> 09:39.269
This way.

09:59.552 --> 10:01.960
Kendra and her family reside here.

10:01.993 --> 10:04.033
Hopefully she is now with Thor.

10:19.956 --> 10:21.995
My dearest friend.

10:23.395 --> 10:25.888
Kendra used her knowledge only to heal.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.956
And this was her reward.

10:28.756 --> 10:31.841
They've already killed
over half of our people.

10:40.437 --> 10:45.313
It's customary to leave a person's
favourite items outside their grave...

10:45.239 --> 10:48.073
...to take with them
on their journey to Thor.

10:48.959 --> 10:51.663
These items are of no use now
to any of us.

10:51.678 --> 10:53.719
They belong with Kendra.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.611
Sam?

11:17.923 --> 11:19.916
You possess the power!

11:19.961 --> 11:21.207
What?

11:21.283 --> 11:23.490
Well, that would make sense.

11:23.523 --> 11:24.519
Why?

11:24.604 --> 11:30.024
Kendra could use Goa'uld technology
because she was a host to a Goa'uld.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.413
<i>You must be able to
cos you were a host to Jolinar.</i>

11:32.443 --> 11:35.019
Yeah, but... I have no control over this.

11:35.044 --> 11:38.878
Kendra said it took her years
to master the magic of the power.

11:38.845 --> 11:40.884
Are we ready to move outta here?

11:40.924 --> 11:45.753
Uh... We discovered Sam seems to have
the ability to use Goa'uld technology.

11:45.686 --> 11:49.730
- Really? Let's see.
- It seems to have a mind of its own, sir.

11:50.686 --> 11:52.644
Concentrate.

12:09.807 --> 12:12.182
Hey! Watch where you point that thing!

12:12.208 --> 12:13.205
Sorry.

12:13.289 --> 12:17.538
Sam could use one of these ribbon
devices to help us fight the Goa'ulds!

12:17.490 --> 12:21.154
She could use one of those healing
devices we saw Kendra use.

12:26.289 --> 12:29.624
Just... concentrate,
like you did with the other thing.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.090
You mustn't give up.

12:37.131 --> 12:41.000
You must strive to master control
of the power. It takes time.

12:40.971 --> 12:43.011
Well, that's gonna have to wait.

12:43.052 --> 12:47.716
Bring that stuff with you. We should
find a place that's a little less public.

12:47.653 --> 12:49.942
Let me show you where my people hide.

13:20.616 --> 13:21.613
Halt!

13:21.697 --> 13:25.149
Olaf, these are friends.
They came to us through the ring.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.885
These are the dogs of Midgardr.

13:28.857 --> 13:33.152
<i>Thor has abandoned us to the Etins
because they destroyed Thor's hammer!</i>

13:33.099 --> 13:37.726
- It is these that brought this down on us!
- And it is these who can save us!

13:37.659 --> 13:41.111
With their help, we can still
summon the power of Thor.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.139
Don't you understand, woman?

13:43.178 --> 13:46.014
Thor has abandoned us
because of their evil.

13:46.019 --> 13:49.437
Don't you understand
that this woman is right?

13:50.661 --> 13:53.283
- We can help you if you'll let us.
- How?

13:53.301 --> 13:56.088
We've fought the Goa'uld before
and beaten them.

13:56.100 --> 14:01.309
And I will remain to do battle with you
until the Goa'uld are driven from this land.

14:08.263 --> 14:11.514
Of course, we have to know
what we're up against first.

14:11.863 --> 14:14.236
Are you willing to help us on that one?

14:14.264 --> 14:16.340
I know a way around the patrols.

14:16.384 --> 14:18.461
I'll take you.

14:20.344 --> 14:21.969
Good.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.462
If Olaf is right and Thor has rejected us,...

14:42.467 --> 14:44.506
...our last hope lies with you.

14:45.027 --> 14:47.067
Gairwyn...

14:47.907 --> 14:51.573
I doubt Thor's angry.
He may just be far away.

14:51.548 --> 14:54.171
That's why he left the hammer
to protect you.

14:55.068 --> 14:58.734
<i>If only we could gain access
to the Hall of Thor's Might.</i>

14:58.709 --> 15:00.619
I know he would help us.

15:08.990 --> 15:11.029
What is the Hall of Thor's Might?

15:11.071 --> 15:14.940
Oh. The ancient tales tell of a hall...

15:14.912 --> 15:19.289
...in which Thor placed
all of his powers to help us,...

15:19.231 --> 15:20.691
...to defend us.

15:21.831 --> 15:24.869
That may signify an Asgard weapon,
or weapons.

15:24.871 --> 15:26.913
You think they hid weapons here?

15:26.951 --> 15:29.989
Where is this Hall of Thor's Might?

15:42.195 --> 15:43.738
There!

15:46.075 --> 15:48.115
Will you wait here?

15:49.955 --> 15:51.995
All right.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.677
What's with the heads?

16:17.119 --> 16:21.663
They look like those guys
who used to be with Ra back on Abydos.

16:22.599 --> 16:26.216
They are Horus.
They guard the family of Ra.

16:26.198 --> 16:28.951
These probably guard
the Goa'uld Heru-Ur.

16:28.961 --> 16:32.662
And he'd be Ra's what?
Cousin? Uncle? What?

16:32.639 --> 16:35.725
He is the son of Ra, and of Hathor.

16:38.282 --> 16:41.734
- Nice pedigree.
- He's a very powerful System Lord.

16:41.722 --> 16:43.846
Much feared, even among Goa'uld.

16:46.402 --> 16:50.614
He is a conqueror. He eliminates
all who dare tread in his shadow.

16:50.562 --> 16:52.601
Including other Goa'uld.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.858
<i>- Kneel before your God!
- God is Thor!</i>

17:07.845 --> 17:10.252
He taught us to stand as equals!

17:10.286 --> 17:11.827
Agh!

17:15.006 --> 17:19.336
<i>Your God cannot
help you now. Only I can.</i>

17:24.165 --> 17:29.459
Strangers came through the device
you call the portaI. Who are they?

17:30.368 --> 17:31.482
Answer!

17:33.208 --> 17:34.833
Answer.

17:38.249 --> 17:39.412
Answer!

17:39.488 --> 17:43.320
Thor taught us to have... no fear of death!

17:46.450 --> 17:48.489
What did he teach you about pain?

17:50.650 --> 17:52.643
No! Aaargh!

18:35.615 --> 18:38.616
Place heavy guard at the Chaapa-ai!
Find them!

18:50.538 --> 18:53.076
What happened?
Did you run into Apophis?

18:53.097 --> 18:56.634
- Not exactly.
- It was the Goa'uld called Heru-Ur.

18:56.618 --> 18:58.659
- You're kidding!
- Friend of yours?

18:58.698 --> 19:01.070
Horus the Elder, ancient Egyptian God.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.134
Pretty mean, considering
his parents were Ra and Hathor.

19:04.138 --> 19:07.804
- We know.
- So, did you find anything we can use?

19:07.780 --> 19:10.402
The good news is, with enough artillery,...

19:10.421 --> 19:12.993
...we could blow those pyramids
to high hell.

19:13.019 --> 19:16.056
- And the bad news is?
- The Stargate is heavily guarded.

19:16.059 --> 19:20.057
- The Goa'uld know we are here.
- So we can't evacuate the Cimmerians.

19:20.019 --> 19:23.604
I guess we'll just have to hole up in here
till things calm down.

19:23.582 --> 19:27.626
Things will not calm down,
Daniel Jackson. They will calm up.

19:30.540 --> 19:33.413
He means things will escalate, of course.

19:33.423 --> 19:37.884
The new pyramids are landing pedestals
for the Goa'uld mother ships.

19:37.824 --> 19:41.951
They will arrive soon and contain
large numbers of death gliders.

19:41.903 --> 19:43.730
We're on our own, kids.

19:43.784 --> 19:48.280
If we can use C4 to blow up a Goa'uld
ship, why not use it to blow up the camp?

19:48.226 --> 19:50.432
Well, it's a small practical problem.

19:50.464 --> 19:53.038
If we use all the C4
to blow the camps now,...

19:53.065 --> 19:56.848
...what do we use when the ships
and gliders show up later?

19:57.266 --> 20:01.596
Guys, there's a... third option here
we might want to consider.

20:02.665 --> 20:06.795
There's a legend around here
about a Hall of Thor's Might.

20:06.747 --> 20:10.698
Daniel,... there's a time
and place for mythology.

20:10.667 --> 20:16.088
With respect, we thought Thor's hammer
was a myth until we proved it was real.

20:15.988 --> 20:19.107
Jack, I think Thor's might
may refer to... uh...

20:19.107 --> 20:23.486
...an alien weapon or weapons
that have been hidden away for centuries.

20:23.430 --> 20:27.012
- We could use the fire power, sir.
- Gairwyn can take us there.

20:29.269 --> 20:33.980
Much as I hate to admit it, it sounds like
our old buddy Thor is our best bet.

20:34.871 --> 20:38.619
Why don't you two try to find this...
weapon, or whatever it is?

20:38.590 --> 20:42.291
Teal'c and I will lay some explosives,
try to slow the attack.

20:42.270 --> 20:44.512
- Yes, sir.
- Olaf?

21:00.873 --> 21:02.913
This is it.

21:06.634 --> 21:08.673
This is the Hall of Might?

21:08.714 --> 21:11.384
You were expecting something different?

21:12.155 --> 21:14.195
Well,... uh...

21:14.234 --> 21:16.275
...maybe a hall?

21:17.275 --> 21:20.644
- I see nothing that could be a weapon.
- I'm sure this is it.

21:21.076 --> 21:23.993
Well, maybe this will
send us somewhere else.

21:23.996 --> 21:27.531
Like the obelisk sent Jack and Teal'c
to Thor's hammer.

21:31.356 --> 21:33.645
It is forbidden to touch the stone.

21:41.478 --> 21:43.518
<i>Daniel?</i>

21:43.558 --> 21:46.762
<i>- Wow! What a ride!
- Where are we?</i>

21:46.759 --> 21:48.088
Agh!

21:50.400 --> 21:53.152
Well, this is a step in the right direction.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.698
It fits the definition of the word "hall".

21:56.278 --> 21:58.686
I have a really bad feeling about this.

21:58.720 --> 22:04.226
I don't understand. No inscriptions,
no alien devices, and no visible way out.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.829
Wait.

22:15.961 --> 22:17.539
I am Thor.

22:17.604 --> 22:20.058
You are brave to come before me.

22:20.083 --> 22:22.325
O mighty Thor, we need your help.

22:22.363 --> 22:26.195
However, only the worthy
may witness Thor's might.

22:26.164 --> 22:28.371
<i>Do you not think me worthy?</i>

22:30.204 --> 22:33.740
- Why has he forsaken me?
- It's just a holographic recording.

22:33.723 --> 22:37.010
It's being projected through
that hole in the ceiling.

22:37.006 --> 22:39.578
Oh, yeah, if you say so.

22:41.765 --> 22:43.721
So... what does it mean?

22:45.246 --> 22:47.286
I'm not sure.

22:47.326 --> 22:52.403
Maybe somehow we have to prove we're
worthy before he'll trust us with his might.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.700
Which you still think is a weapon.

22:54.728 --> 22:56.602
I'm hoping so, at this point.

22:56.647 --> 23:01.025
- How can we prove our worth?
- Well, as the rest of the room is empty,...

23:00.968 --> 23:04.005
...I assume it has something
to do with this stone.

23:11.128 --> 23:13.371
Thor is preparing to strike us down!

23:13.411 --> 23:16.412
No, he's not! He's not a wrathful God.

23:16.410 --> 23:18.486
Then what is he doing?

23:30.371 --> 23:32.944
<i>Oh, this is...
this is definitely a test.</i>

23:34.452 --> 23:37.739
So, uh...
we're supposed to go across this?

23:37.731 --> 23:43.238
Yeah... I don't suppose this is the time
to bring up my problem with heights.

24:05.817 --> 24:09.565
<i>We had to cross a beam
worse than this in basic training.</i>

24:09.537 --> 24:12.406
Please, be my... be my guest.

24:12.416 --> 24:14.457
Of course, we had a net.

24:51.382 --> 24:53.422
OK. Come on.

25:04.903 --> 25:06.445
Come on...

25:15.464 --> 25:16.545
Oh!

25:17.065 --> 25:18.476
Gairwyn!

25:21.105 --> 25:23.727
Just... Just slide across. You can do it.

25:23.744 --> 25:26.746
Thor shook the beam! He wants me dead!

25:26.744 --> 25:29.498
- No, he doesn't!
- It's OK. Just stay there.

25:29.507 --> 25:32.080
<i>- I'll come and get you.
- No.</i>

25:32.107 --> 25:33.768
I'll do it.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.866
You're already across.

25:45.508 --> 25:50.217
<i>I'm right behind you now.</i>

25:52.147 --> 25:54.189
Almost there.

25:56.750 --> 25:58.375
OK...

25:59.951 --> 26:03.568
What we're gonna do here,
you're gonna give me your hand.

26:03.550 --> 26:05.840
I'm gonna help you get back on track.

26:06.711 --> 26:10.494
And then we're gonna finish
this thing together. OK?

26:11.230 --> 26:12.606
Argh!

26:28.233 --> 26:29.857
Are you guys OK?

26:32.273 --> 26:35.478
OK. So... uh... what was that all about?

26:42.316 --> 26:45.103
You have shown
true selfIessness and bravery.

26:45.116 --> 26:48.901
Willingness to sacrifice oneself
to save another is honourable.

26:48.876 --> 26:50.703
I salute you.

26:50.756 --> 26:52.832
Now you must add wisdom to courage.

26:52.876 --> 26:54.787
Solve the riddle of the runes...

26:54.836 --> 26:57.042
...and I will show you my true might.

27:08.078 --> 27:10.118
How did he know what we did?

27:10.159 --> 27:13.444
There must be some sort of
advanced sensors in here.

27:15.519 --> 27:17.726
So, now what?

27:27.040 --> 27:29.711
Now we try to solve
the riddle of the runes.

28:02.565 --> 28:04.936
Sons of Midgardr! The Etins approach!

28:04.964 --> 28:07.800
A large contingent
coming up the lower path.

28:11.365 --> 28:13.405
We must fight!

28:13.445 --> 28:15.153
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:22.807 --> 28:25.214
- You said you would help us fight.
- Quiet.

29:04.573 --> 29:06.613
Thunder.

29:06.652 --> 29:08.692
And fire!

29:08.732 --> 29:10.773
<i>You do possess Thor's might.</i>

29:11.614 --> 29:13.275
Hyaaaaaa!

29:22.454 --> 29:25.740
- Now we are matched.
- Thanks.

29:27.214 --> 29:31.343
O'Neill, another patroI approaches.
We should leave immediately.

29:31.295 --> 29:32.920
Come.

29:42.176 --> 29:44.335
Daniel, we don't have time for this.

29:44.376 --> 29:49.005
The faster we solve the riddles, the faster
we get whatever Thor's might is.

29:48.938 --> 29:50.978
Riddles. OK.

29:51.018 --> 29:54.552
- Is Thor testing us?
- I figure it's some sort of safeguard.

29:54.538 --> 29:59.332
That whoever finds the weapons is smart
enough to use the technology wisely.

29:59.259 --> 30:02.593
Like he wants to be sure
his children have grown up enough...

30:02.579 --> 30:05.534
...before he hands them
the keys to the armoury.

30:05.539 --> 30:10.535
It doesn't make sense that he would waste
time when the planet's under attack.

30:10.461 --> 30:13.332
Remember, he thinks
this is a protected planet.

30:13.340 --> 30:16.175
That his anti-Goa'uld devices
are infallible.

30:16.181 --> 30:20.393
He couldn't know there'd be any hurry
to find whatever Thor's might is.

30:20.340 --> 30:22.630
There is a hurry. Can you solve this?

30:23.623 --> 30:25.662
Uh... OK.

30:27.503 --> 30:29.875
Um... They aren't letters, or words.

30:29.902 --> 30:32.394
Originally, runes were ideographic.

30:32.423 --> 30:34.997
- So each rune stands for an idea.
- Right.

30:35.022 --> 30:38.228
The first one relates to
Thor's protective power.

30:38.223 --> 30:42.435
That could mean anything. The Goa'uld
detector they had at the gate...

30:42.384 --> 30:44.423
...or even the hammer device.

30:44.463 --> 30:47.215
Uh... This last one represents a wagon,...

30:47.223 --> 30:49.798
...but it was also called Thor's chariot.

30:49.826 --> 30:52.398
Now, that could be a... spaceship.

30:53.506 --> 30:55.628
Great. What about the middle two?

30:55.665 --> 30:57.705
Um...

30:57.746 --> 30:59.786
One is a dice cup, or Fate.

30:59.826 --> 31:02.115
The other is a horse or... movement.

31:08.146 --> 31:12.310
- What's going on, Teal'c?
- They are signalling their position.

31:12.268 --> 31:16.597
They will close into an interlaced pattern,
sweep in and corner us.

31:16.549 --> 31:19.467
It is an old Jaffa hunting technique.

31:20.348 --> 31:22.388
Come on, Daniel.

31:30.911 --> 31:36.072
I've never seen simple geometric shapes
in any runes. I don't know what these are.

31:35.990 --> 31:39.824
If we don't come up with an answer soon,
we'll have to find a way out.

31:39.791 --> 31:44.122
- The colonel will need our help.
- Daniel,... could the answer be here?

31:49.873 --> 31:52.874
No. Those aren't runes.
They're pictographs.

31:54.073 --> 31:56.741
<i>OK.</i>

31:56.753 --> 31:58.461
One wall has runes.

31:58.513 --> 32:00.553
One has pictographs.

32:00.594 --> 32:02.967
And one has simple geometric shapes.

32:09.115 --> 32:11.321
I have no idea what he wants us to do.

32:18.476 --> 32:20.515
There is no shame.

32:20.557 --> 32:23.510
Perhaps in more time
you will have come of age.

32:23.516 --> 32:25.556
Excuse me. Could you, uh...

32:25.596 --> 32:28.349
Could you please just... One second!

32:35.597 --> 32:41.222
OK. Norse runes were ideas,
but in later years they became letters.

32:41.118 --> 32:43.656
But they were also numbers.

32:43.680 --> 32:46.930
Three... fourteen...

32:46.920 --> 32:48.913
...fifteen...

32:48.960 --> 32:51.000
...nine.

32:56.441 --> 32:58.480
It's no use. It...

32:58.520 --> 33:00.762
It doesn't mean anything.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.046
Yes, it does.

33:03.121 --> 33:06.076
3.14159. It's pi!

33:06.082 --> 33:07.826
- It's pi?
- Pi!

33:08.801 --> 33:12.219
It's pi? That's what
you wanted us to figure out?

33:12.202 --> 33:15.453
Right. "Pi" is an Earth term.
We have to depict it somehow.

33:16.243 --> 33:18.450
On the geometric shapes.

33:23.963 --> 33:26.003
This has to be it.

33:26.044 --> 33:28.583
The inside of the circle is soft like sand.

33:28.605 --> 33:32.900
Pi is used to find the circumference
of a circle by measuring the radius.

33:32.846 --> 33:34.257
The radius.

33:44.247 --> 33:46.618
That's it.

33:56.488 --> 33:57.769
Oh, my God.

34:02.488 --> 34:07.650
I am the actual one...
whom you know as Thor.

34:15.170 --> 34:20.331
Olaf, get your people as far back into
the cave as possible. Keep them quiet!

34:20.251 --> 34:22.291
Put the fires out.

34:23.411 --> 34:26.530
- How are we doing?
- We have been located, O'Neill.

34:28.610 --> 34:30.652
Come on, Daniel.

34:31.333 --> 34:33.409
Daniel, this is uncanny.

34:33.452 --> 34:37.152
It looks just like the descriptions
of the Roswell Greys back home.

34:37.132 --> 34:41.713
- Those stories may be true after all.
- You think the Asgards visited Earth?

34:42.373 --> 34:43.916
Why not?

34:45.454 --> 34:48.574
I am the supreme commander
of the Asgard fleet.

34:48.574 --> 34:50.282
How can this be?

34:50.335 --> 34:53.251
In the ten-span since I created this world...

34:53.255 --> 34:57.668
...you are the first to reach
this level of contact.

34:57.615 --> 35:01.280
You have finally grown wise enough
to see me in my true form.

35:01.255 --> 35:05.550
These are the wise ones. I would never
have come this far without their help.

35:05.938 --> 35:08.429
Gairwyn, it's a hologram.

35:08.456 --> 35:11.907
It was probably recorded
a thousand years ago.

35:11.896 --> 35:14.471
- It can't hear you.
- On the contrary.

35:15.297 --> 35:18.382
My image is a living transmission.

35:18.378 --> 35:20.536
I am communicating to you...

35:20.579 --> 35:23.949
...from my quarters aboard
the Asgard ship Biliskner.

35:23.938 --> 35:26.690
You mean, you're the real Thor?

35:29.099 --> 35:31.139
This is... This is...

35:31.179 --> 35:33.219
This is great. Um...

35:33.701 --> 35:36.322
We need your help. The Goa'uld are here.

35:36.340 --> 35:37.833
Impossible.

35:37.900 --> 35:40.438
Cimmeria is a safe world.

35:40.460 --> 35:44.791
- Yeah... We sort of messed that up.
- Daniel... Careful.

35:44.742 --> 35:49.202
If we want them to be our friends,
we have to show them they can trust us.

35:49.141 --> 35:51.264
You see, we came here a year ago...

35:51.302 --> 35:55.597
...to meet you and your people,
to make an alliance against the Goa'uld.

35:55.543 --> 35:59.126
One of our party, a Jaffa,
was trapped in your labyrinth.

35:59.103 --> 36:00.976
The Jaffa serve the Goa'uld.

36:01.023 --> 36:02.768
This one does not.

36:02.822 --> 36:06.442
He stands with them, and now with us,
to fight the Etins.

36:06.422 --> 36:09.840
We had no choice but to destroy
the hammer to free our friend.

36:09.824 --> 36:11.568
And by doing so,...

36:11.625 --> 36:15.623
...you have opened Cimmeria
to attack by the Goa'uld.

36:16.144 --> 36:17.688
Yeah, apparently.

36:17.744 --> 36:21.447
So... if you have any weapons
that might be of help,...

36:21.425 --> 36:23.882
...we would like to set things straight.

36:23.905 --> 36:25.282
Weapons?

36:25.347 --> 36:28.550
Isn't that what all those tests
were here to protect?

36:28.545 --> 36:31.916
The tests were designed to tell us
when the Cimmerians...

36:31.907 --> 36:35.193
...would be advanced enough
to see us as we really are.

36:35.188 --> 36:39.731
- We did not expect outside interference.
- We didn't mean to interfere.

36:40.228 --> 36:41.972
<i>No, wait!</i>

36:47.710 --> 36:50.746
- Where's Gairwyn?
- Good question.

37:09.032 --> 37:11.867
That's timing for you.
The parade's about to begin.

37:11.871 --> 37:15.371
- How many are out there?
- We are outnumbered 20 to one.

37:15.353 --> 37:19.054
Daniel, you look
suspiciously empty-handed.

37:19.032 --> 37:22.237
- Yeah, yeah.
- "Yeah, yeah" what?

37:22.233 --> 37:24.192
- There's nothing, Jack.
- Nothing?

37:24.233 --> 37:26.724
- We did meet the real Thor.
- Did you, now?

37:26.753 --> 37:28.545
Nice fella?

37:32.753 --> 37:34.795
All right. Here we go.

37:40.795 --> 37:42.338
Shield yourselves!

37:48.237 --> 37:51.985
Intruders from the Chaapa-ai!

37:51.956 --> 37:54.577
Throw down your weapons!

37:54.597 --> 37:56.257
Surrender now...

37:56.317 --> 37:59.769
...and the slaves of this world
will be allowed to live...

37:59.757 --> 38:02.297
...and serve Heru-Ur!

38:03.677 --> 38:06.134
Fight, and they will all die!

38:06.159 --> 38:09.445
Colonel, we don't have
enough weapons to go around.

38:09.438 --> 38:13.389
They will all be killed, O'Neill.
Women and children included.

38:13.360 --> 38:17.903
If we are responsible for this invasion,
we can't allow that to happen.

38:44.284 --> 38:45.992
Take care of your people.

38:55.925 --> 38:59.793
<i>Before they rode into battle,
the Sioux used to say...</i>

38:59.764 --> 39:01.804
..."This is a good day to die."

39:11.126 --> 39:13.166
Then again, maybe not.

39:27.329 --> 39:29.239
Oh, my!

39:29.288 --> 39:34.034
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I think this is... Thor's chariot.</i>

39:33.969 --> 39:36.295
An Asgard mother ship.

39:36.329 --> 39:39.663
I've heard them described in Jaffa legend.

40:11.253 --> 40:13.295
The Etins are gone.

40:13.333 --> 40:17.664
Thor sends his thanks.
It was your help that made this possible.

40:17.614 --> 40:20.365
Well, to be honest with you,
I think we got lucky.

40:20.375 --> 40:23.577
He told me to give you a message
to satisfy your curiosity.

40:23.574 --> 40:28.202
I'm to tell you he's a member of a species
who have visited your world often.

40:28.135 --> 40:30.626
They are a friend to all, protector of all.

40:30.655 --> 40:33.360
Except the Goa'uld,
with whom they are at war.

40:33.376 --> 40:35.416
Well, that's very nice.

40:35.456 --> 40:37.913
But I'd still like to meet the old guy.

40:37.938 --> 40:41.722
Well, he said that, like us,
you're still much too young.

40:46.018 --> 40:48.260
For us there is still much to rebuild.

40:48.297 --> 40:51.715
Thor has promised to leave
an Asgard teacher to help us.

40:52.018 --> 40:54.806
Then Cimmeria will be a safe world again.

40:54.818 --> 40:56.858
- That is good.
- Yes, it is.

40:56.900 --> 41:01.561
I'm to tell you that Thor's new hammer
will make an exception for Teal'c.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.539
You are welcome here any time.
