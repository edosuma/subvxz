10:53.609 --> 10:56.351
Miss Don't Got Time
for Backstories.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.528
[grunts]

11:01.748 --> 11:03.532
Ah.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.490
-[phone ringing]
-Hey, Tonya.

11:05.534 --> 11:06.796
You calling to get the lowdown

11:06.840 --> 11:09.494
on my rugby player
from last night?

11:09.538 --> 11:13.411
Daddie Dan
doesn't get my awnings...

11:13.455 --> 11:15.500
-[groaning]
-What?

11:15.544 --> 11:17.328
That idea was amazing.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.722
Your dad has always been
shut down to new things.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.290
Like when we wanted to play
beer pong in third grade.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.813
How do I tell the kids?

11:23.857 --> 11:25.293
And Freddie?

11:25.336 --> 11:26.729
Rip that Band-Aid off.

11:26.773 --> 11:29.514
They'll handle it. Uh-oh.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.516
Uh-oh. Got to, got to go, babe.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.257
-Uh, good luck with the fam.
-[rapid beeping]

11:33.301 --> 11:35.172
Mwah.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.696
[sighs]

11:42.223 --> 11:44.181
Oh, my God, why didn't
you answer your phone?

11:44.225 --> 11:46.531
[gasps] Baby,
what's wrong with your face?

11:46.575 --> 11:50.448
I'm allergic to Aunt Maggie's
skin dust.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.799
And while we're on the topic,

11:52.842 --> 11:54.757
we found her body, too.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.846
The police and coroner came.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.370
It was a scene.
The cool neighbors all watched.

11:59.414 --> 12:00.850
-It was awful.
-Wait. What?

12:00.894 --> 12:03.200
No one arranged for the body
or the funeral.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.246
I mean,
families just do not communicate

12:05.289 --> 12:07.378
about their elderly these days.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.379
One sec, kids.

12:08.423 --> 12:09.685
-Freddie, come here.
-[grunts]

12:10.730 --> 12:11.905
Listen...

12:11.948 --> 12:13.384
Look what I found,

12:13.428 --> 12:15.822
a huge box of Maggie's
old porn magazines.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.475
Gross.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.608
"Hide-and-Go-Sex
and Other Naughty Games

12:19.651 --> 12:21.218
for Big, Scary Houses."

12:21.262 --> 12:23.264
Daddie Dan didn't like my idea.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.440
Wait. What? How?

12:25.483 --> 12:26.789
Did you use the flashlight?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.573
Yes, I used the flashlight.

12:28.617 --> 12:29.792
Oh, honey. I'm sorry.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.576
That's terrible.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.361
But at least
we have WrestleMonium

12:33.404 --> 12:35.580
-to distract the kids.
-Well...

12:35.624 --> 12:37.887
Daddie Dan also says...

12:37.931 --> 12:40.716
we can't go to the country club
for WrestleMonium

12:40.760 --> 12:43.937
because, you know,
we're not "members" anymore.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.852
What? Are you serious?

12:45.895 --> 12:47.767
What are we going to do?

12:47.810 --> 12:48.811
No, no, no, no!

12:48.855 --> 12:50.421
Freddie, look at me.

12:50.465 --> 12:53.250
We can...

12:53.294 --> 12:57.602
recreate WrestleMoniumfor
the twins by doing a party here.

12:57.646 --> 13:00.692
Then we tell the kids the news
about the house after.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.999
-Cool?
-Cool.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.740
[smooching]

13:06.611 --> 13:07.743
Kids...

13:07.787 --> 13:10.267
we have a great idea.

13:10.311 --> 13:13.618
Let's throw
a WrestleMoniumparty

13:13.662 --> 13:15.620
in this crazy house.

13:15.664 --> 13:16.621
Huh?

13:16.665 --> 13:17.840
What? No way.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.886
We-we always do it
at the country club.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.366
Who will we watch it with?
Just us?

13:22.410 --> 13:24.847
Aw. Seems a little low-key.

13:24.891 --> 13:28.416
What? Ugh. I am bored
of all those good old boys,

13:28.459 --> 13:30.287
pseudo-rich country club people.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.289
We'll invite the neighbors.

13:32.333 --> 13:35.292
I don't know why
you guys are pumped...

13:35.336 --> 13:38.643
but, goddamn, it's contagious.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.689
I'm in!

13:40.732 --> 13:42.952
Come on, Todd, just this once.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.520
For me, honey?

13:45.563 --> 13:47.522
[announcer voice]:
Are... you... in?

13:47.565 --> 13:50.655
Whatever, okay. I'll try.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.571
And... Break balls.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.792
[grunting]

13:56.836 --> 13:58.794
[groaning]

13:58.838 --> 13:59.839
[grunts]

13:59.882 --> 14:01.841
[vocalizing]

14:04.365 --> 14:05.757
Ha, there it is.

14:05.801 --> 14:07.629
[laughs quietly]

14:08.935 --> 14:11.633
Okay, we got quote, unquote

14:11.676 --> 14:13.983
"illegal" cable and Internet.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.768
Now, to access that
super expensive Pay-per-view,

14:16.812 --> 14:19.815
I got to hit
the rich side of town.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.904
Todd, let me do the talking.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.993
You're good at being a dick.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.560
I'm good at people.

14:26.735 --> 14:27.736
Or...

14:27.779 --> 14:29.346
you're emotionally intelligent,

14:29.390 --> 14:31.871
and I'm just
intelligent-intelligent.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.918
Hey, I'm Ollie. This is Todd.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.834
You guys want to come over
and watch WrestleMonium

14:38.878 --> 14:40.792
and eat stuff
at our house tonight?

14:40.836 --> 14:42.794
Oh, yeah. What's up, Dead House?

14:42.838 --> 14:45.710
You know we found our dead aunt
in that house?

14:45.754 --> 14:47.625
Nice coincidence.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.627
You're strange.

14:49.671 --> 14:50.933
I like that.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.761
All right, well,
I'm Shauna, so count me in.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.005
[quiet, maniacal chuckle]

15:24.967 --> 15:26.534
[tires squeal]

15:28.492 --> 15:29.841
Just like Daddie always said,

15:29.885 --> 15:32.148
"Make sure to have
a stockpile of cable."

15:32.192 --> 15:35.064
Right? [cackling]

15:35.108 --> 15:36.936
Oh, look.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.112
The white kids that live
in crazy old Maggie's house.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.765
How is she?

15:40.809 --> 15:42.071
-Dead.
-Way dead.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.420
We hope.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.466
Wait.
I thought no one lived there.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.772
You're right. Technically,
no one was living there

15:47.816 --> 15:48.991
for the past few months.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.036
But we live there now.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.821
[laughing]

15:54.040 --> 15:55.606
FREDDIE:
Okay...

15:55.650 --> 15:58.000
let's see here.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.002
[grunting]

16:00.046 --> 16:01.743
Well, that should do it.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.095
What's that weird smell?

16:06.139 --> 16:07.705
I feel high.

16:07.749 --> 16:08.968
Is this high?

16:10.012 --> 16:11.666
[gasps] Shit.

16:12.710 --> 16:13.842
Outside!

16:13.885 --> 16:15.670
[grunting]

16:15.713 --> 16:16.714
[laughing]

16:16.758 --> 16:17.889
Ooh.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.630
[both laughing]

16:19.674 --> 16:21.632
[whimpering]

16:21.676 --> 16:22.982
Okay, uh, uh.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.722
[whimpering, crying]

16:24.766 --> 16:26.855
[panting, groaning]

16:26.898 --> 16:28.683
Oh my god. Uh.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.859
[panting]

16:30.902 --> 16:32.469
[chuckles]

16:32.513 --> 16:33.993
Ah... [chuckling]

16:34.036 --> 16:36.560
[giggling]

16:36.604 --> 16:37.822
[whooping]

16:37.866 --> 16:39.215
Oh, hi there. How are you?

16:39.259 --> 16:40.869
I'm Freddie.

16:40.912 --> 16:43.785
Wh... [screaming]

16:43.828 --> 16:46.788
Ah, get off, get off! [screams]

16:46.831 --> 16:48.790
[grunting]

16:49.269 --> 16:51.010
Ah! Ha-ha!

16:52.054 --> 16:53.925
And stay out!

16:57.668 --> 16:59.192
Here we go.

17:01.716 --> 17:04.066
Yes! Mom, you did it.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.025
You're goddamn right I did.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.809
[deep voice]:
Oh yeah!

17:07.852 --> 17:09.854
Ha, I'm coming' to get ya.

17:18.559 --> 17:19.734
Finished.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.953
Ooh, would you take a look
at that spread?

17:21.997 --> 17:23.172
Freddie, we get it.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.044
We see you.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.828
Clap. Clap. Clap.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.525
Oh, always
glad to have you over, Tonya.

17:28.569 --> 17:29.874
Hey, is your boyfriend coming?

17:29.918 --> 17:31.615
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

17:31.659 --> 17:34.009
You're all alone
because you're awful. Hi.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.099
All right, you two. Leave
the fighting to WrestleMonium.

17:37.143 --> 17:40.059
Yes! Dad did his ham volcano
poppers,

17:40.102 --> 17:42.104
fried catfish poppers,

17:42.148 --> 17:45.890
and crunch pouches with
timed-release popper cheese.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.544
[knock on door]

17:47.588 --> 17:48.806
They're here! They're here!

17:48.850 --> 17:50.156
Okay, now everybody be cool

17:50.199 --> 17:52.288
because our neighbors seem
very cool.

17:52.332 --> 17:54.725
They're, uh... what's the
safe way to say this?

17:54.769 --> 17:56.118
They're, uh...

17:56.162 --> 17:58.599
-[stammering]
-They're Black...

17:58.642 --> 18:00.166
And you're gross?

18:00.209 --> 18:02.124
Wait. Aren't I supposed
to want Black friends?

18:02.168 --> 18:03.169
I'm brown.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.127
Why don't you act
like I'm a trophy?

18:05.171 --> 18:07.086
Well, I-I do care about
your race, but the thing is,

18:07.129 --> 18:09.697
I'm too distracted
by your awfulness.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.568
Welcome. Welcome.

18:11.612 --> 18:14.571
Uh, and just so you know,
we are a family of allies

18:14.615 --> 18:15.833
in this house.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.661
Here's a card
with all my social handles,

18:17.705 --> 18:19.663
just in case you want
to check out my feeds,

18:19.707 --> 18:23.102
or tag this super diverse
and progressive hang. All right.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.842
GBENGE:
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.584
Is this a reality prank show?

18:27.628 --> 18:29.151
Welcome, folks.

18:29.195 --> 18:32.023
There's tons of beer,
wine and whiskey.

18:32.067 --> 18:36.158
Can I get a Diet Coke and a lot
less goddamn talk about booze?

18:36.202 --> 18:39.161
Ollie, just take me to
the coolest old lady dead stuff

18:39.205 --> 18:40.684
you've found right now.

18:40.728 --> 18:41.816
Dude...

18:41.859 --> 18:44.862
Know what dust really is?

18:44.906 --> 18:48.214
I knew Maggie's house
would smell like mothballs.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.912
Kind of exciting
to see inside this house.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.131
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.176
Exciting like
a shitty amusement park

18:54.220 --> 18:56.613
where you walk through
an old lady's stinky house

18:56.657 --> 18:57.962
and watch wrestling
with white people.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.181
Ham thing's good, though.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.748
I will get you the recipes.

19:02.053 --> 19:05.013
Okay, okay, everybody,
everybody, listen up.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.884
We're the Harpers.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.191
And we do shit for real.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.889
[crackling]

19:11.933 --> 19:13.152
Ooh.

19:14.109 --> 19:16.198
[crackling]

19:21.682 --> 19:22.813
[tires squeal]

19:22.857 --> 19:24.772
[horn blaring]

19:24.815 --> 19:27.035
[cheering, whooping]

19:27.078 --> 19:28.341
[gasping]

19:28.384 --> 19:31.170
-Oh, yay.
-[cheering]

19:31.213 --> 19:33.172
Well, son of a fucking bitch.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.222
-Uh, what is going on?
-What happened?

19:40.266 --> 19:41.789
Uh, every...
We'll get it taken care of.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.617
Where's the goddamn fuse box?

19:43.660 --> 19:45.749
-[growls]
-[shrieking]

19:45.793 --> 19:47.534
[screaming]

19:50.841 --> 19:52.669
[squealing]

19:54.193 --> 19:55.672
Oh, well, that happened.

19:55.716 --> 19:58.153
-Whew.
-Oh.
-[laughter]

19:58.197 --> 20:00.068
Whew. Ooh.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.983
Maybe the fuse box is in here.

20:03.506 --> 20:04.681
[screaming]

20:04.725 --> 20:06.030
Oh, uh, ah, oh...

20:07.249 --> 20:09.599
Oh, I get it.
"Hide-and-Go-Sex."

20:09.643 --> 20:11.297
Huh.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.995
-That's a sex outfit.
-No, no, just a dead body
in a closet.

20:14.038 --> 20:15.475
Nothing could be more innocent.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.520
Okay, we're done here.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.218
Yep, us too.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.831
I know it was busy tonight,
but my name is Gbenga.

20:23.874 --> 20:26.007
That right there is Shauna
and that is Katrina.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.878
Next time,
here's a little tip for you:

20:27.922 --> 20:29.837
don't treat us
like diversity trophies.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.231
Oh, my God.
I'm so bad and wrong.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.189
Please forgive me.
I-I-I hear you.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.235
Told ya, Freddie. Ha.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.674
Hello, 911?

20:40.717 --> 20:43.024
Yeah, you missed a corpse.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.853
-I can still make this damn
thing work if I just...
-Mom.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.333
No, no, no, Todd.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.073
I'll just patch into someone's
cloud or some other...

20:49.117 --> 20:50.553
Stop it, Mom!

20:50.597 --> 20:52.555
Just stop it!

20:52.599 --> 20:54.209
You know...

20:54.253 --> 20:57.081
you can't just engineer us
out of this.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.258
I've tried enough for you guys.

20:59.301 --> 21:02.043
I hate this place.

21:02.086 --> 21:04.263
I'm sleeping in the truck!

21:07.831 --> 21:09.268
Uh...

21:10.269 --> 21:11.922
He's sensitive.

21:11.966 --> 21:14.273
I'll stay with him.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.593
Well, that was nice.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.203
We should go to more funerals.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.553
We really should.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.598
I feel for old Aunt Maggie.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.905
I hate that her family
forgot her.

21:37.948 --> 21:40.777
Let's promise
to not do that to each other.

21:40.821 --> 21:41.822
Right?

21:43.954 --> 21:45.739
[takes deep breath]

21:45.782 --> 21:47.088
Kids...

21:47.131 --> 21:48.916
I got to tell you the truth.

21:48.959 --> 21:51.222
I lost my job at the factory.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.660
Oh, Mom. I'm sorry.

21:53.703 --> 21:57.272
And we had to put
the old house up for sale.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.752
Oh, Mom...

21:58.795 --> 22:00.623
Wait. What?

22:00.667 --> 22:03.931
We're stuck here, on the north
side, because it's cheaper

22:03.974 --> 22:06.281
and the only job I can find
is for your granddad.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.284
And the Harper House
will be our home for a while.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.634
Okay? Toddy?

22:12.722 --> 22:14.115
[gasps]

22:15.638 --> 22:17.597
Look,
it's going to be okay, kids.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.687
All right? Just keep the possums
away from me, please.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.392
Mom.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.047
Mom, I...

22:33.090 --> 22:34.614
I miss our old house.

22:34.657 --> 22:37.834
Aw, Toddy, come here.

22:39.183 --> 22:41.142
[grunts] Oh...

22:43.013 --> 22:45.799
I am really sorry
we lied to you kids.

22:45.842 --> 22:49.803
And I promise one of my ideas
will get us our old life back,

22:49.846 --> 22:51.326
but until then,

22:51.370 --> 22:55.286
let's all try to just be cool
with this change, right?

22:56.462 --> 22:58.812
I know our life
is changing, but...

22:58.855 --> 23:00.814
I'm scared.

23:00.857 --> 23:02.816
And you should be scared.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.035
Of my wrestling moves.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.297
What?

23:06.341 --> 23:08.169
Terrible Todd.

23:08.212 --> 23:09.692
Oh, no, no, no, don't you dare.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.172
[grunting]

23:11.215 --> 23:15.002
Oh, don't think you're
getting away, Oblivious Ollie.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.004
Get over here.

23:17.047 --> 23:18.048
[laughing]

23:18.092 --> 23:19.223
[grunting, laughing]

23:19.267 --> 23:21.269
-Oh. Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.753
-[growling]
-[laughing]

23:28.232 --> 23:30.060
Whoa. Whoa.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.889
You're all going to get
a beatdown now...

23:32.933 --> 23:35.675
Freddie the Frightened
Possum Boy included.

23:35.718 --> 23:36.980
That's right. [grunts]

23:37.024 --> 23:39.679
Because I am a...

23:39.722 --> 23:41.332
I am a... [laughs]

23:41.376 --> 23:43.726
I am a poor-ass mama
with a hangover

23:43.770 --> 23:46.033
and a crappy job
in a shitty house.

23:46.076 --> 23:48.078
[laughter]

23:49.166 --> 23:52.300
-Oh. Oh.
-Oh, yeah, I'm taking you down.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.345
[laughing]

23:55.782 --> 23:57.044
Ha-ha!

23:57.087 --> 23:58.437
Who's on top now?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.264
-[grunting, panting]
-DEBBIE: Ooh, give me that.
