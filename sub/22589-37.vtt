00:11.054 --> 00:13.306
<i>NARRATOR".
High noon in Gotham City...</i>

00:13.515 --> 00:17.727
...on a <i>day when the number 12
is to become an evil omen...</i>

00:17.936 --> 00:20.230
<i>...for all good citizens.</i>

00:20.438 --> 00:23.608
Very good, Chief O'Hara. Impressive.

00:23.816 --> 00:27.904
Part of our new scientific
crime-fighting program, commissioner.

00:28.112 --> 00:30.448
It shows every art treasure in Gotham City...

00:30.657 --> 00:33.117
...so we can check them out
at a moment's notice.

00:33.326 --> 00:35.662
With this map
and improved criminal procedures...

00:35.870 --> 00:39.874
...we should be well on our way to putting
Gotham City's criminals behind bars.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.710
Never mind the bars, look to the stars.

00:42.919 --> 00:46.631
Not to mention Venus and Mars.
Ha-ha-ha!

00:46.798 --> 00:48.800
Mother McGinty, it's Joker.

00:49.008 --> 00:51.678
In police headquarters? The nerve.

00:56.182 --> 00:57.850
Naughty, naughty, commissioner.

00:58.059 --> 01:01.104
Let's keep your blue-coated buffoons
outside.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.273
What do you want here, Joker?

01:03.481 --> 01:06.568
Just passing the time.
As I did all those months in prison...

01:06.776 --> 01:10.863
...after those caped cabbageheads
were lucky enough to apprehend me.

01:11.072 --> 01:13.491
Luck had nothing to do with it, Joker.

01:13.700 --> 01:17.495
Your warped criminal mind is no match
for the wits of Batman and Robin.

01:17.704 --> 01:20.331
They'll outsmart you every time.

01:20.540 --> 01:23.459
A stroke of luck, I tell you. Agh.

01:23.626 --> 01:28.006
Well, in any event, I used my free time
to cultivate a new hobby.

01:28.214 --> 01:30.633
Astrology, the science of the stars...

01:30.842 --> 01:33.761
...the science of the future. Ha-ha-ha.

01:33.970 --> 01:35.722
Woo! Ha-ha-ha!

01:35.888 --> 01:37.640
Mustn't touch, chief. Oh, ho.

01:37.849 --> 01:40.476
My, what slow learners.

01:40.685 --> 01:43.271
Well, what have we here?

01:43.479 --> 01:46.149
This should go well with my star charts.

01:48.026 --> 01:50.486
Now, enough of this foolery.

01:50.695 --> 01:54.157
I've come to announce a new crime wave
for Gotham City.

01:54.365 --> 01:57.035
This is the first of the zodiac crimes.

01:57.243 --> 02:00.663
Look for 11 more,
and don't forget to keep score.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.378
Venus, my dear.

02:07.587 --> 02:11.716
Keep the stars out of your eyes, gentlemen.
Woo, ha-ha-ha!

02:11.883 --> 02:13.926
Going up, please.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:24.896 --> 02:26.773
Mother McGee, he's gone.

02:28.608 --> 02:30.568
The nerve of the scoundrel.

02:37.784 --> 02:43.623
I think it's very nice you decided to try out
for the school band, Dick.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.334
Don't you think so, Bruce?

02:46.542 --> 02:47.960
Yes, Aunt Harriet.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.088
Very nice.

02:54.092 --> 02:56.052
The Batphone, sir.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.846
- What's that, Alfred?
-it's the Bat--

03:00.932 --> 03:02.433
That phone, sir.

03:02.642 --> 03:04.852
I suggest you take it in the study.

03:05.061 --> 03:08.314
I think maybe I'll practice my marching,
Aunt Harriet.

03:13.528 --> 03:15.988
- Yes, commissioner.
-I have bad news for you, Batman.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.366
That master of maudlin mockery is back.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.576
He just barged smack into this office.

03:20.785 --> 03:22.578
We'll be right there.

03:24.122 --> 03:25.998
The Joker again.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.085
To the Batpoles.

03:29.293 --> 03:32.547
Gosh, Bruce,
it's like trying to get away from an octopus.

05:17.109 --> 05:21.322
There it floated, in front of me nose.

05:21.531 --> 05:24.659
Dancing back and forth.

05:24.867 --> 05:28.037
I can imagine it looked quite mysterious,
Chief O'Hara...

05:28.246 --> 05:31.582
...but the principle behind the mechanism
is really quite simple.

05:31.791 --> 05:33.626
By magnetizing a steel rod...

05:33.835 --> 05:37.505
...and using the polarity of the steel girders
in this building...

05:37.713 --> 05:41.050
Joker could have balanced the rod in midair
by using a simple rheostat.

05:41.259 --> 05:44.011
But what did he mean
by all that talk about the stars?

05:44.220 --> 05:46.848
And the wave of 12 crimes he promised.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.267
And why steal our official rare art map?

05:49.475 --> 05:53.312
He may be planning a crime
for each sign of the zodiac.

05:57.275 --> 05:58.526
Holy astronomy.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.027
Aries, the Ram.

06:00.236 --> 06:01.654
Taurus, the Bull.

06:01.863 --> 06:03.739
Gemini, the Twins.

06:03.948 --> 06:05.157
Virgo, the Virgin.

06:05.366 --> 06:06.617
Libra, the Scales.

06:06.826 --> 06:09.787
Scorpio, the Scorpion, et cetera, et cetera...

06:09.996 --> 06:12.206
...ad infinitum.

06:13.749 --> 06:16.544
Ha. Just as I thought.

06:16.752 --> 06:19.630
A cleverly concealed two-way spy device.

06:19.839 --> 06:22.592
You mean the Joker could be listening to us
at this moment?

06:22.800 --> 06:26.262
<i>JOKER".
Exactly, Boy Blunder. Ha, ha.</i>

06:26.470 --> 06:28.764
<i>- That's him.
- Speaking through my spy device...</i>

06:28.973 --> 06:32.977
<i>...which Batman detected as I expected.
Ha-ha-ha!</i>

06:33.936 --> 06:37.481
<i>But I warn you, Batman,
I don't feel rejected...</i>

06:37.690 --> 06:41.569
<i>...with a fortune in treasure still unprotected.</i>

06:49.201 --> 06:52.872
However did you know the gadget
was here, Batman?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.833
Simple matter of deduction, Chief O'Hara.

06:56.042 --> 07:00.963
Joker would never come to this office
simply to steal a rare art map.

07:01.505 --> 07:04.091
Rare art map.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.968
R-A-M .

07:06.177 --> 07:08.262
Aries, the Ram, the first sign.

07:08.471 --> 07:11.974
Gosh, Batman,
you think he's already started?

07:12.558 --> 07:15.061
Whenever Joker's involved...

07:15.269 --> 07:19.440
...who knows when he started
or what he started.

07:19.649 --> 07:22.234
The caped crusaders don't know
what's in store for them.

07:22.401 --> 07:25.529
At long last,
I'll have them out of my way permanently.

07:25.738 --> 07:26.989
That's a long time, Joker.

07:27.198 --> 07:30.576
The proceeds from my zodiac crimes
will give me what I've always wanted.

07:30.785 --> 07:35.414
Complete control of Gotham City. Oh, yes.

07:35.623 --> 07:39.168
The caped crusaders
are now solidly star-crossed.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.755
Venus.

07:43.089 --> 07:45.341
Venus, will you stop bouncing?

07:45.549 --> 07:47.051
Your orders, Joker.

07:47.259 --> 07:50.137
A larcenous mind in a limber body.

07:50.346 --> 07:52.098
- We must stay trim.
-No.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.474
Batman's no fool.

07:53.683 --> 07:55.935
He's no match for me
with the stars as my guide.

07:57.395 --> 08:00.022
Oh, get the door, Mercury.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.281
Freight shipment. Collect.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.411
- Two thousand four hundred fifty dollars.
-What?

08:13.619 --> 08:16.706
Just pay him, Mercury.
Quick, give me a hand with this.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.960
Ha-ha-ha! Careful now. Careful.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.048
What's inside, Joker?

08:26.257 --> 08:28.259
Two thousand dollars is a lot of money.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.886
Oh, this merchandise is worth $2000.

08:31.095 --> 08:34.347
It's worth 200,000, you cheapskate.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.767
At least you could have sent me
a plane ticket.

08:36.976 --> 08:40.563
We had to get you into Gotham City
without anyone knowing about it, Pengy.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.106
Especially Batman.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.276
You better have something good cooked up
for that caped creep.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.028
Oh, don't you worry, Pengy.

08:47.236 --> 08:50.823
The pot's being put on the fire right now,
and Batman's in it.

08:51.032 --> 08:54.660
Oh, you are a man after my own heart, Joker.

08:54.869 --> 08:57.121
- Black, eh?
-Black as pitch.

09:00.124 --> 09:05.212
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile, the caped crusaders
study a copy of the rare art map.</i>

09:05.796 --> 09:08.340
There are dozens of places
the Joker could strike next.

09:08.549 --> 09:12.136
And we're not even sure he'll use the map
for his next crime.

09:14.430 --> 09:17.725
I have a hunch that's Joker calling for me.

09:17.933 --> 09:20.436
- May I, commissioner?
-Oh, please. Yeah.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.649
- Batman speaking.
-A clue, caped curmudgeon.

09:25.858 --> 09:31.572
Taurus, the Bull, is next on my show
and you'll soon be singing a song of woe.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.577
Taurus, the Bull. Do you think it's a trick?

09:36.786 --> 09:38.954
I don't think it's a trick, Robin.

09:39.163 --> 09:41.791
I don't think it's Taurus either.

09:42.166 --> 09:45.836
A song of woe. Gemini.

09:46.045 --> 09:47.671
- The Twins?
-Of course.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.799
Sing a song of woe.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.635
- I'm confused, Batman.
-Think, Chief O'Hara.

09:52.843 --> 09:55.304
Gotham City's current singing sensations...

09:55.513 --> 09:59.183
...are two young minstrels called The Twins.
Let's go, Robin.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.103
<i>NARRATOR".
As in Joker's hideout, once more...</i>

10:03.604 --> 10:05.356
That's delicious.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.775
Now, if my calculations are correct--

10:07.983 --> 10:10.236
And my calculations are always correct.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.447
Those masked muttonheads
may have jumped to the wrong conclusion.

10:13.656 --> 10:14.782
Right.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.951
Are you sure you can handle this, Pengy?

10:17.159 --> 10:21.247
What? Those booted buttinskies
are no match for the Penguin.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.165
I'll slice them to slivers.

10:23.374 --> 10:25.126
I'll pound them to pieces.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.044
I'll dice them to driblets.

10:29.088 --> 10:31.507
Now, as soon as Pengy jumps in,
you cut out, Venus...

10:31.715 --> 10:33.843
...and join me you-know-where.
-Right, Joker.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.219
Oh, let me at them.

10:35.427 --> 10:40.224
I'll fix their hash
and I'll grind them into masked meatballs.

10:54.321 --> 10:58.450
Undoubtedly the Twins rehearsing
for tonight's performance.

11:03.289 --> 11:07.418
Perhaps another time
might be more appropriate for that, Robin.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.753
Oh, sorry.

11:26.770 --> 11:27.855
You are The Twins?

11:28.063 --> 11:30.691
That's what the sign says, man.

11:30.900 --> 11:34.862
How can we smooth your path?

11:35.070 --> 11:37.907
We came here to warn you.
Someone is after you.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.534
Like, we know that, Wonder Boy.

11:40.743 --> 11:43.579
We're referring to a criminal threat. Joker.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.456
Forget that canary, Batman.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.959
You're up against the Black Bird of Prey.
Waugh, Waugh!

11:49.126 --> 11:51.128
Penguin.

11:59.428 --> 12:02.598
There he goes, Robin. After him.

12:06.185 --> 12:07.895
We're off.

12:25.663 --> 12:27.831
So long, dynamic dunderheads.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.793
Enjoy your ride on the Joker's boom bug.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.216
Well, now, so these here...

12:37.383 --> 12:40.344
...are them there fabulous Twins.

12:40.511 --> 12:41.637
Oh, yes, sir.

12:41.845 --> 12:45.182
Named for their identical size,
cut and brilliance.

12:45.808 --> 12:49.603
And they're only $250,000, for the pair.

12:51.522 --> 12:54.233
Aw, get them for me, Daddy, huh?

12:54.441 --> 12:57.152
I always did like little purties.

12:57.361 --> 13:02.700
Well, now, Bella-Mae Sue, if it is gonna
pleasure you, why, sure. Ha, ha.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.576
Son, fetch over your guards.

13:04.785 --> 13:08.414
I wanna walk these diamonds out of here
safe-like. Ha-ha-ha.

13:08.580 --> 13:12.209
Of course, sir. Uh, Pinkerton. Burns.

13:16.505 --> 13:21.218
These here the only policemen
you got on the premises, sugar?

13:21.552 --> 13:23.595
Yes. Just these two, but they're picked men.

13:23.804 --> 13:28.309
Well, in that there case,
I'll just fetch out my money.

13:37.151 --> 13:39.278
- May I borrow your comb, Alfred?
-Yes, sir.

13:39.445 --> 13:42.823
So while Penguin was leading us
on a wild-goose chase...

13:42.990 --> 13:44.825
...Joker was stealing the real Twins.

13:45.034 --> 13:49.788
I'm afraid so, Robin.
But with the help of the Bat-analyst...

13:49.955 --> 13:53.167
...we should be back on Joker's trail.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.294
Thanks to Venus' wig.

13:55.502 --> 13:59.006
You know, Batman,
she seemed like a nice girl in that costume.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.675
I suspect she is a nice girl, down deep...

14:01.884 --> 14:04.303
...but she's fallen in with bad companions.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.306
And who knows what her home life
was like?

14:07.473 --> 14:11.810
Now, as soon as the Bat-analyzer
determines the components of that wig...

14:12.019 --> 14:13.604
...we can trace it and then--

14:13.771 --> 14:15.856
- We nail Joker.
-Aha.

14:16.774 --> 14:18.192
Ah.

14:18.359 --> 14:24.656
Yes. The wig is 98 percent human hair...

14:24.865 --> 14:26.700
...backed up by the finest silk.

14:27.534 --> 14:31.997
There's only one high-fashion shop
in Gotham City...

14:32.206 --> 14:34.458
...that has this quality of coiffeur.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.460
Harry's Hair Lair.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.213
Harry and Bruce Wayne
belong to the same golf club.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.424
Perhaps Harry can supply
the address we need.

14:42.633 --> 14:46.178
And then under cover of darkness...

14:53.018 --> 14:55.562
- Batman.
-ls Joker here?

14:57.398 --> 14:58.941
Venus...

14:59.191 --> 15:04.071
...how did a nice girl like you
get mixed up in an ugly business like this?

15:04.279 --> 15:06.198
The Joker says I'm very useful.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.826
He says I'm his right-hand girl.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.369
Why don't you throw him over?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.913
What's he ever done
besides get you into trouble?

15:13.122 --> 15:15.457
You mean rat on my friends?

15:15.666 --> 15:18.085
Criminals have no friends, Venus.

15:18.293 --> 15:22.506
Help us get Joker and I'm sure the authorities
will take that into account at your trial.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.550
No, Batman.

15:24.758 --> 15:28.679
I may be felonious, but I'm no fink.

15:29.138 --> 15:32.391
I'm pleased to see
that you have standards, Venus...

15:32.599 --> 15:35.519
...albeit unlawful ones.

15:35.727 --> 15:39.148
However, in this case,
your loyalty is misguided.

15:41.900 --> 15:47.739
From your reaction, Venus,
I would say that is no idle call.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.744
<i>- Hello?
- Hello? Where's the Joker?</i>

15:52.953 --> 15:54.830
Penguin.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.749
He stepped out for a few moments.
May I take a message?

15:57.958 --> 16:00.377
Tell him everything's set for tonight.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.754
Would you have any more details?

16:02.963 --> 16:04.339
He knows all the details.

16:04.548 --> 16:07.634
And tell him I want a 50-50 split.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.095
No fast ones.

16:14.308 --> 16:15.350
Mm, Waugh.

16:18.604 --> 16:19.813
Venus...

16:20.022 --> 16:22.816
...when two arch-criminals
like Penguin and Joker...

16:23.025 --> 16:24.860
...combine their criminal talents...

16:25.068 --> 16:27.070
...people are likely to get hurt.

16:27.279 --> 16:29.198
Innocent people.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.450
Won't you help us, Venus?

16:32.242 --> 16:34.161
All right.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.996
I'll do it for you, Batman.

16:36.413 --> 16:39.583
I don't know what the Joker plans,
but I do know where.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.043
And I'll take you there.

16:45.297 --> 16:48.675
<i>You who have dreams</i>

16:48.842 --> 16:51.720
<i>If you act, they'll come true</i>

16:51.887 --> 16:55.724
Joker didn't give you any hint
as to what he planned?

16:55.933 --> 16:57.351
No, Batman.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.896
All I know
is that he's meeting the Penguin here.

17:01.188 --> 17:04.483
<i>If you have a soul and a spirit</i>

17:06.068 --> 17:09.279
Stay here. Come on, Robin.

17:09.488 --> 17:13.200
- All right, Pengy, let her rip.
-Bombs away. Waugh, waugh!

17:13.367 --> 17:15.410
Sounds like the Penguin.

17:15.618 --> 17:18.413
- Look out, Robin.
- You're on target, Pengy.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.541
- Hit them again. Woo, hoo, hoo!
-Waugh, Waugh, waugh!

17:46.900 --> 17:51.405
<i>They crawl and they crawl to the floor</i>

17:51.572 --> 17:55.534
<i>And there's nothing in the world</i>

17:56.034 --> 17:58.579
All right, tonsils, ransom time. Let's go.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.539
Help! I'm being kidnapped!

18:00.747 --> 18:02.708
- Police!
-Ah, ha-ha-ha!

18:04.042 --> 18:06.253
- Let's go, Venus.
-No.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.797
- Come on, Venus.
-No.

18:22.477 --> 18:23.729
I said come on.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.814
Joker, don't leave me.

18:26.023 --> 18:28.859
Come back, you fish-headed fink.

18:29.026 --> 18:31.570
So it is Penguin.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.032
- What are you doing out of prison?
-I needed a little change of air.

18:35.240 --> 18:39.411
- You think you'll get it helping the Joker?
-Oh, that pasty-faced felon ran out on me.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.372
There's never honor
among thieves, Penguin.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.291
You, of all people, should know that.

18:44.499 --> 18:47.294
Well, at least I helped him make fools
of you two.

18:47.502 --> 18:50.589
He got the Lion and the Crab
in one fell swoop.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.008
Holy terminology, Batman. He's right.

18:53.216 --> 18:56.637
Leo Crustash.
Leo, the Lion and crustacean for the Crab.

18:56.845 --> 19:00.932
Joker did get the Lion and the Crab,
but we have Penguin.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.769
That should make Warden Crichton
quite happy.

19:03.935 --> 19:06.313
Waugh! Waugh, waugh, waugh.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.443
A picture of the Virgin Bereaved...

19:11.652 --> 19:14.029
...one of Gotham City's
most valuable art treasures.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.990
Worth nearly a cool million,
according to experts.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.117
And most certainly, Joker's next target.

19:19.326 --> 19:23.246
It's the only item on this map
that even resembles Virgo, the Virgin.

19:23.455 --> 19:27.209
Virgo, the next sign
on the Joker's criminal zodiac.

19:27.751 --> 19:32.547
It's time for us to make a horoscope, Robin.

19:32.756 --> 19:39.096
I predict that within the hour,
Joker will be at the museum.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.139
And I predict we'll be waiting for him.

19:41.348 --> 19:45.686
It's been quite an evening so far,
but, uh, boy, will he see stars.

20:09.459 --> 20:13.296
Every guard's been alerted to let Joker in
but not out.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.340
Gosh, this is sure a good place...

20:15.507 --> 20:17.551
...for his total eclipse.
-Mm.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.889
Well met by moonlight, Batman.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.599
As per my calculations...

20:24.808 --> 20:27.811
...on my terms and at my convenience.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.771
- Ha-ha-ha.
-The odds are all even, Joker.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.064
Two against two.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.066
Even, my erroneous urchin?

20:33.275 --> 20:35.193
Let me cast you a horoscope.

20:35.402 --> 20:40.782
Instead of two, you'll discover seven
about to give you a free trip to heaven.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.853
Ha, ha.

21:52.771 --> 21:56.691
First class fencing, Batman. Ha-ha-ha. Sorry.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.611
- For what?
-My unexpected ally.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.197
Venus unobserved.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.207
Throw it, you ninny.

22:13.750 --> 22:18.255
- Throw it.
-Sorry, caped crusaders.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.851
The stars demand a sacrifice.

22:31.059 --> 22:32.769
To the altar of the sun.

22:43.446 --> 22:45.073
Comfy, boys'?

22:45.282 --> 22:47.284
Couldn't we call it off, Joker?

22:47.492 --> 22:51.079
Mercy to a brave foe and all that?

22:51.246 --> 22:53.957
You're losing your nerve, Venus,
which is a shame.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.793
But you're also losing your senses,
which is criminal.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.169
Hold her.

22:59.796 --> 23:05.218
Batman, I realize right now,
I've made a terrible mistake.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.178
Repentance is better late than never.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.889
Ew.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.683
You're making me ill. Ugh!

23:12.183 --> 23:14.936
Now I must cancel your horoscopes,
caped crusaders.

23:15.145 --> 23:18.899
The moment of occlusion is at hand.
Ha, ha. Look up.

23:21.443 --> 23:24.362
A century ago,
that stone dropped from the heavens.

23:24.571 --> 23:28.533
At dawn, it will fall again onto your heads.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.995
Ha-ha-ha! Mercury, the thermite.

23:32.203 --> 23:34.205
- Fiend!
-Yes.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.666
I'll set that miniature solar system
in motion...

23:36.875 --> 23:39.920
...with a thermite bomb
attached to the planet Saturn.

23:40.128 --> 23:43.924
When it comes around,
the thermite will burn through the cable...

23:44.132 --> 23:47.135
...depositing the meteorite
onto your dunderheads.

23:54.643 --> 23:58.563
Bring her along. She'll recover
her criminal senses. Ha, ha!

23:59.147 --> 24:01.024
Goodbye, dynamic duo.

24:01.232 --> 24:03.568
I predict a falling out.

24:04.305 --> 24:10.357
