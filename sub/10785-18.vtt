WEBVTT

00:01.708 --> 00:03.083
Dawson: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.083 --> 00:04.125
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

00:04.125 --> 00:06.291
I THINK YOUR FILM IS
COMPLETELY UNINSPIRED.

00:06.291 --> 00:07.750
IT'S A PREPOSTEROUS
SOAP OPERA ABOUT
A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS

00:07.750 --> 00:09.667
WHO TALK TOO MUCH.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.125
WE'RE TYPES OF PEOPLE,

00:11.125 --> 00:13.250
AND JUST AS I'M LIKELY TO BE
FOUND IN CHURCH ON SUNDAY--

00:13.250 --> 00:15.208
I'M MORE OF
A SATURDAY NIGHT SLUT.

00:15.208 --> 00:16.250
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.000
HOW COME I HAVE NEVER
FELT MORE LIKE ONE?

00:18.000 --> 00:19.041
I WANT YOU BACK.

00:19.041 --> 00:20.667
DAWSON...
WE'RE SOUL MATES.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.667
YOU AND I
ARE MEANT TO BE.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.083
WHO'S THERE?

00:29.417 --> 00:31.041
DADDY.

00:50.375 --> 00:54.208
DAWSON, THAT WAS
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:54.208 --> 00:57.917
IT WAS MOVING.
IT'S FUNNY.

00:57.917 --> 00:59.917
IT WAS REAL.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.250
YOU'RE SAYING THIS
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY MOTHER.

01:02.250 --> 01:06.708
NO, I'M NOT.
YOU ARE INCREDIBLY TALENTED.

01:07.542 --> 01:10.041
AND YOU ARE
INCREDIBLY BIASED.

01:11.542 --> 01:16.041
YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAD
SUCH A DISTINCT, CLEAR
VISION FOR THIS MOVIE.

01:16.041 --> 01:19.166
I MEAN,
I--I SAW EVERY MOMENT.

01:19.166 --> 01:22.792
I HEARD EVERY WORD
OF DIALOGUE.

01:22.792 --> 01:27.208
BUT I GUESS I JUST
FAILED TO TRANSLATE
THAT VISION ONTO FILM.

01:27.208 --> 01:31.250
YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T
BRING IT TO LIFE.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.333
AND WHAT ABOUT
ALL THESE VISIONS THAT
I HAVE FOR THE FUTURE?

01:32.333 --> 01:34.667
WHAT IF I CAN'T BRING
THOSE TO LIFE EITHER?

01:34.667 --> 01:38.959
SWEETHEART, THE TRICK
IS TO STAY TENACIOUS

01:38.959 --> 01:40.834
AND NOT LET ANY MINOR,

01:40.834 --> 01:43.834
AND IN THIS CASE,
VERY MINOR SETBACK

01:43.834 --> 01:45.917
DERAIL YOUR VISION.

01:45.917 --> 01:48.166
I SUPPOSE I COULD
RE-EDIT IT.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.542
THERE YOU GO.

01:49.542 --> 01:53.333
YOUR MOVIE MAY NOT BE
CITIZEN KANE,  BUT...

01:53.333 --> 01:55.375
IT'S NOT
BRIDE OF CHUCKY  EITHER.

01:55.375 --> 01:57.000
THE WAY MY FILM TEACHER
DESCRIBED IT,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.041
YOU'D THINK IT WAS THE
WORST, MOST OFFENSIVE
PIECE OF JUNK

01:59.041 --> 02:00.834
EVER CAPTURED ON FILM.

02:00.834 --> 02:04.291
OH, HONEY, THAT IS JUST
ONE PERSON'S OPINION.

02:06.792 --> 02:08.000
AND, UM...

02:08.000 --> 02:11.625
SPEAKING ABOUT TEACHERS
AT YOUR SCHOOL,

02:11.625 --> 02:14.458
HOW'S YOUR FATHER ENJOYING
HIS NEW PROFESSION?

02:14.458 --> 02:17.000
HE LIKES IT, I THINK.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.750
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD TO SEE HIM
IN THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE,

02:18.750 --> 02:20.125
CONSORTING WITH THE ENEMY.

02:22.291 --> 02:23.708
YOU REALLY MISS HIM,
DON'T YOU?

02:23.708 --> 02:26.041
YEAH.

02:27.333 --> 02:28.458
LATELY,
MORE THAN EVER.

02:30.166 --> 02:33.125
WELL, IF YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT, THEN...

02:33.125 --> 02:35.291
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE
SOME OF YOUR OWN ADVICE.

02:36.458 --> 02:37.875
MAYBE.

03:34.291 --> 03:38.125
MORNING, JOEY.
HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.500
I MIGHT HAVE OVERDONE IT
A BIT HERE.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.500
DAD.

03:42.500 --> 03:43.708
I AM SO GLAD
TO BE HOME.

03:43.708 --> 03:46.291
I NEVER THOUGHT
MAKING BREAKFAST
FOR MY DAUGHTERS

03:46.291 --> 03:47.792
COULD MAKE ME
SO HAPPY.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.542
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
THAT I WOULD WAKE UP

03:50.542 --> 03:54.000
AND DISCOVER THAT LAST NIGHT
WAS JUST A DREAM.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.834
IT'S NOT A DREAM.

03:55.834 --> 03:57.917
IT'S ALL OVER, JOEY.

03:57.917 --> 03:58.917
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
EVER AGAIN.

03:58.917 --> 03:59.750
[BABY GURGLES]

03:59.750 --> 04:01.542
HEY, DAD,
I WAS JUST THINKING,

04:01.542 --> 04:02.792
WITH THE CATERING AND
EXPANDING OUR HOURS,

04:02.792 --> 04:06.166
OUR FINANCES ARE GONNA BE
STRAIGHTENED OUT IN NO TIME.

04:06.166 --> 04:08.041
JOEY, GOOD MORNING.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.500
HI.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.041
YOUR SISTER AND I
WERE UP THIS MORNING

04:11.041 --> 04:13.417
SCHEMING UP WAYS
TO TURN A PROFIT
AT THE RESTAURANT.

04:13.417 --> 04:14.917
HEY, REMEMBER
MY FRIEND PAM?

04:14.917 --> 04:17.083
SHE'S GETTING MARRIED
THIS SATURDAY
AT THE ATHENAEUM,

04:17.083 --> 04:18.834
AND HER CATERER
FELL THROUGH AND...

04:18.834 --> 04:20.541
AND THE ICE HOUSE
TO THE RESCUE.

04:20.541 --> 04:23.125
SO DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
ASK A FEW OF YOUR FRIENDS
TO WORK AS SERVERS?

04:23.125 --> 04:24.083
SURE.

04:24.083 --> 04:26.125
GIMME MY GRANDSON.
GIMME, GIMME, GIMME.

04:26.125 --> 04:29.083
OH, ISN'T THIS EXCITING?

04:29.083 --> 04:31.458
I MEAN, WE'RE
FINALLY ON OUR WAY
TO GETTING OUT OF DEBT.

04:31.458 --> 04:33.083
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

04:33.083 --> 04:34.750
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT IN THE
UPSCALE CATERING BUSINESS.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.000
WE GRILL CHEESEBURGERS.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.542
DON'T WORRY.
WITH DAD'S HELP,
WE'LL BE FINE.

04:38.542 --> 04:40.583
WE'RE POTTERS.
WE'RE QUICK STUDIES,

04:40.583 --> 04:43.291
AND WE ALWAYS LAND
ON OUR FEET, RIGHT?

04:43.959 --> 04:46.417
[BABY GURGLES]

04:46.417 --> 04:48.208
JOEY, I'M THE FATHER.

04:48.208 --> 04:49.250
IT'S MY JOB TO DO
THE WORRYING.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.542
YOUR DAYS OF WORRYING
ARE OVER.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.625
I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

05:01.792 --> 05:03.417
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

05:07.875 --> 05:08.917
WE'RE A FAMILY AGAIN.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.834
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
BETTER. YOU'LL SEE.

05:11.834 --> 05:14.333
LET'S EAT.

05:19.291 --> 05:20.583
Jack: SINCE WHEN
DO WE CATER WEDDINGS?

05:21.625 --> 05:22.959
SINCE MY FATHER GOT
PAROLED FROM PRISON

05:22.959 --> 05:24.667
AND TOOK OVER
THE RESTAURANT.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.166
I KNOW, UH...

05:30.041 --> 05:31.125
YEAH, I WALKED HOME
LAST NIGHT,

05:31.125 --> 05:34.792
AND I, UH,
FOUND HIM STANDING
ON THE PORCH.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.667
JOEY, YOU MUST BE
THRILLED.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.500
YEAH.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.000
IT'S JUST...
A LITTLE WEIRD.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.834
LIKE I'VE BEEN
BROADSIDED
BY A BUS.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.708
A HAPPY BUS.

05:46.708 --> 05:48.083
UM...

05:49.333 --> 05:50.834
JUST REELING FROM
THE SHOCK, I GUESS.

05:50.834 --> 05:54.625
SURE, OF COURSE,
BUT...SOMETHING'S WRONG.

06:01.542 --> 06:03.000
JACK...

06:04.792 --> 06:06.750
I DON'T KNOW, UM...

06:09.333 --> 06:12.041
LAST NIGHT,
I WAS LYING IN BED,
AND I COULDN'T SLEEP.

06:12.041 --> 06:15.500
I--I WAS SHAKING.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.708
I HAVE THIS PIT
IN MY STOMACH
THE SIZE OF A GRENADE.

06:18.708 --> 06:21.375
I'VE SEEN MY DAD
ONE TIME IN 3 YEARS.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.542
WE CAN'T JUST PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

06:23.542 --> 06:25.458
AND THEN THIS
WHOLE CATERING PLAN

06:25.458 --> 06:27.000
IS JUST COMPOUNDING
MY ANXIETIES.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I MEAN, ALL THE
BLUE BLOODS OF CAPESIDE

06:29.000 --> 06:30.166
ARE GOING TO BE
AT THE WEDDING.

06:30.166 --> 06:32.375
I MEAN, THIS ISN'T THE
MOST LOW-PROFILE SETTING

06:32.375 --> 06:34.750
FOR MY FATHER TO
RE-EMERGE INTO SOCIETY.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.458
YEAH.

06:36.458 --> 06:37.542
MAYBE YOU NEED
TO TELL YOUR FATHER

06:37.542 --> 06:39.375
THAT THIS CATERING PLAN
IS ILL-CONCEIVED.

06:39.375 --> 06:43.333
TOO MUCH, TOO SOON,
YOU KNOW.

06:43.333 --> 06:46.417
AND I THINK YOU NEED
TO DEAL WITH THIS REUNION
WITH YOUR FATHER

06:46.417 --> 06:48.417
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL
BEFORE YOU GO PUBLIC.

06:48.417 --> 06:51.542
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN BESSIE'S FACE
THIS MORNING.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.875
I MEAN,
SHE WAS SO EXCITED.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.875
I DON'T WANT TO RAIN
ON THEIR PARADE.

06:58.500 --> 07:03.166
WELL...DON'T WORRY.

07:03.166 --> 07:04.542
I'LL BE THERE.

07:07.542 --> 07:10.250
SO I'M GONNA GO BACK,
AND I'M GONNA
RE-EDIT THE MOVIE

07:10.250 --> 07:12.000
'CAUSE I'M THINKING
MAYBE I JUST PUT
THE PIECES TOGETHER WRONG.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.500
YOU KNOW?

07:16.375 --> 07:18.250
YOU KNOW, IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT MY PARENTS ARE SEPARATED

07:18.250 --> 07:19.333
AND MY MOTHER
IS HEART-BROKEN.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.583
SHOULD I REALLY BE
SUBJECTED TO THIS?

07:21.583 --> 07:24.250
WELL, SHE DOES HAVE
CERTAIN ASSETS, DAWSON.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.250
PACEY...
I'M SORRY, BRO.

07:26.250 --> 07:27.083
HEY, GUYS.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.708
DID, UH, JOEY
TALK TO YOU YET?

07:28.708 --> 07:30.000
ABOUT WHAT?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.417
WELL, THE ICE HOUSE
IS CATERING A WEDDING
ON SATURDAY,

07:31.417 --> 07:34.834
AND WE NEED
SOME EXTRA HANDS.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.250
PAYS 60 BUCKS
FOR THE DAY.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.667
SOLD. FOR 60 BUCKS,
I'D CATER YOUR ASS.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.750
HA HA, WELL,
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

07:40.750 --> 07:44.250
SO THE ICE HOUSE
IS CATERING WEDDINGS NOW?

07:44.250 --> 07:45.792
YEAH, MR. POTTER'S
BRAINCHILD.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.291
MR. POTTER?

07:47.291 --> 07:52.083
MM-HMM. YEAH,
HE'S--HE WAS--

07:52.083 --> 07:53.708
OH, UH...

07:53.708 --> 07:55.458
JOEY'S DAD GOT
PAROLED YESTERDAY.

07:55.458 --> 07:56.959
REALLY?

07:56.959 --> 07:59.041
YEAH, HE'S--
HE'S BACK HOME.

07:59.041 --> 08:00.458
WOW.

08:11.208 --> 08:14.375
FIGURED I'D FIND YOU
IN HERE, ABBY. UM...

08:14.375 --> 08:16.000
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR JUST A SECOND?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.291
OH, FUNNY. I WAS OPERATING
UNDER THE MISCONCEPTION

08:18.291 --> 08:19.792
THAT WE WEREN'T SPEAKING.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.417
I THOUGHT SINCE
DAWSON'S MOVIE WRAPPED,

08:21.417 --> 08:24.417
YOU NO LONGER HAD
ANY USE FOR ME.

08:24.417 --> 08:25.500
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.166
UM, NEVER MIND.
SEE YOU LATER.

08:27.166 --> 08:28.166
NO, JEN, WAIT.

08:28.166 --> 08:30.041
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

08:30.041 --> 08:32.707
OH, ABBY, I--

08:32.707 --> 08:36.917
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING
JUST SO FRUSTRATED.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.457
YOU KNOW, LIKE ALL
I WANTED TO DO WAS--
WAS CLIMB THE WALLS

08:39.457 --> 08:41.207
OR--OR LIGHT THE PLACE
ON FIRE AND...

08:41.207 --> 08:43.125
[CHUCKLES]

08:43.125 --> 08:45.000
NO, IT'S NOT FUNNY.
I'M SERIOUS.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.333
I MEAN, I AM SO TENSE
AND SO JUST BORED.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.250
AND I FEEL LIKE
I'M GOING BERSERK.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.166
I FEEL LIKE I'M
GOING BERSERK HERE.

08:52.166 --> 08:56.291
WELL, JEN, UM, THERE WAS ONCE
THIS SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT

08:56.291 --> 08:58.375
WHERE THEY ISOLATED
THIS RAT IN A SMALL BOX

08:58.375 --> 08:59.333
WITHOUT ANY OF ITS
LITTLE RAT TOYS

08:59.333 --> 09:02.708
OR SAWDUST
OR STIMULATION.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.375
WELL, EVENTUALLY,
THE RAT STARTED
GNAWING OFF ITS OWN FEET.

09:05.375 --> 09:06.375
YOU ARE THAT RAT.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.208
CAPESIDE'S THE BOX.

09:08.208 --> 09:09.875
NEED I SAY MORE?

09:11.959 --> 09:13.708
I MEAN, LIKE, I'VE TRIED
CHANGING MY IMAGE.

09:13.708 --> 09:16.875
AND IF NOBODY HERE
IS GONNA ACCEPT ME,

09:16.875 --> 09:18.667
THAN WHAT'S THE POINT
LIVING THIS--
THIS PRISTINE

09:18.667 --> 09:22.875
AND THIS--THIS TEDIOUS
EXISTENCE, YOU KNOW?

09:22.875 --> 09:27.750
AND THEN, WHEN I THINK
BACK ON THE BEST TIMES
THAT I'VE HAD THIS YEAR,

09:27.750 --> 09:29.417
I'VE--I'VE HAD THEM
WITH YOU.

09:29.417 --> 09:33.875
HA HA. I THINK
THAT'S THE NICEST THING
ANYONE'S EVER SAID TO ME.

09:35.959 --> 09:37.333
[CHUCKLES]

09:37.333 --> 09:41.667
SO, THEN, WHAT DO
RATS DO FOR FUN
ON THE WEEKEND?

09:41.667 --> 09:43.792
OH, I DON'T KNOW,
BUT YOU KNOW US RATS.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.417
WE CAN ALWAYS
SNIFF OUT SOMETHING.

09:46.417 --> 09:47.250
HERE WE ARE. LATE AGAIN.

09:47.250 --> 09:49.583
HA HA HA.

09:50.750 --> 09:54.291
60 BUCKS FOR YOU
AND 60 BUCKS FOR ME
EQUALS $120.

09:54.291 --> 09:55.959
DO YOU HAVE AN ABACUS
IN YOUR POCKET,

09:55.959 --> 09:57.792
OR DID YOU JUST
ADD THAT IN YOUR HEAD?

09:57.792 --> 09:58.750
SO WHAT I'M THINKING
IS A ROAD TRIP
TO NEW YORK,

09:58.750 --> 10:01.834
UH, DINNER, AND WE'LL
TAKE IN A SHOW,

10:01.834 --> 10:03.708
AND GO FOR A NICE,
ROMANTIC CARRIAGE RIDE
THROUGH THE PARK.

10:03.708 --> 10:04.750
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

10:04.750 --> 10:05.875
ON A 120 BUCKS?

10:05.875 --> 10:09.083
UH, WHAT DECADE DO YOU
THINK WE'RE LIVING IN?

10:09.083 --> 10:10.542
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IF NOT THE BIG APPLE,

10:10.542 --> 10:14.250
MAYBE JUST A NICE,
ROMANTIC EVENING HERE
IN GOOD OLD CAPESIDE.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.917
BUT I HATE WEDDINGS.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.250
I MEAN, BRIDESMAIDS
IN HIDEOUS DRESSES.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.917
PEOPLE GETTING ALL GOOEY.

10:19.917 --> 10:22.792
THEY'RE TOO MAUDLIN
AND SENTIMENTAL FOR ME.

10:22.792 --> 10:23.917
TOO SENTIMENTAL
FOR YOU?

10:23.917 --> 10:25.375
THE GIRL WHO
JUST YESTERDAY

10:25.375 --> 10:27.417
WAS BROUGHT TO TEARS
BY A NIKE COMMERCIAL.

10:27.417 --> 10:29.166
OK, BUT I DRAW THE LINE
AT WEDDINGS.

10:29.166 --> 10:33.125
THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE
IS AN ANTIQUATED CONSTRUCT.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.917
I THINK THAT IF A COUPLE
WANTS TO STAY TOGETHER,

10:34.917 --> 10:36.041
THEY SHOULD DO SO BY CHOICE.

10:36.041 --> 10:37.959
I MEAN,
ALL THOSE SWEEPING VOWS

10:37.959 --> 10:39.208
AND PUBLIC CEREMONY,

10:39.208 --> 10:41.750
IT JUST SETS PEOPLE UP
TO FAIL MISERABLY.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.375
I KNOW YOU HAVE ISSUES
WHERE THIS IS CONCERNED,

10:43.375 --> 10:45.125
BUT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
TO A WEDDING WITH ME.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.000
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

10:46.000 --> 10:46.959
IF YOU COME WITH ME
ON SATURDAY,

10:46.959 --> 10:48.750
IF BY THE END
OF THE NIGHT,

10:48.750 --> 10:49.792
YOU'RE NOT CONVINCED
THAT WEDDINGS

10:49.792 --> 10:52.000
ARE THE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL RITUAL

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
THAT MANKIND
HAS EVER CREATED,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.125
I'LL LET YOU
KEEP THE MONEY.

10:55.125 --> 10:55.959
ALL OF IT,
YOURS AND MINE.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.583
HMM. WELL,
I HAVE BEEN ITCHING

10:57.583 --> 10:59.875
TO BUY A BRAND
NEW PAIR OF NIKES

10:59.875 --> 11:01.708
THAT I JUST RECENTLY
SAW ADVERTISED.

11:01.708 --> 11:05.208
ANDIE McPHEE, YOUR DAYS
AS A WEDDING CYNIC
ARE NUMBERED.

11:05.208 --> 11:08.208
YEAH, WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT ONE.

11:11.834 --> 11:12.917
[COUGHS]
I THINK

11:12.917 --> 11:16.291
YOU MAY HAVE OVERDONE IT
ON THE HORSERADISH.

11:16.291 --> 11:17.500
CLEARED MY SINUSES
THOUGH.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.000
DAWSON LEERY.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.250
I THOUGHT
WHEN I CAME BACK,

11:20.250 --> 11:20.750
FOR SURE YOU TWO
WOULD BE AN ITEM.

11:20.750 --> 11:21.417
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:21.417 --> 11:23.708
IT'S A LONG STORY.

11:23.708 --> 11:24.792
HELLO, DAWSON.

11:24.792 --> 11:25.834
HEY, MR. POTTER.

11:25.834 --> 11:27.417
YOU'RE A SIGHT
FOR SORE EYES.

11:27.417 --> 11:29.000
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS.
WELCOME BACK.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.333
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.291
THANK YOU.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.500
YOU KIDS
ARE ALL GROWN UP.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.834
IT'S AMAZING.

11:34.834 --> 11:35.834
BUT LET'S CATCH UP
LATER.

11:35.834 --> 11:37.250
I HAVE A HORSERADISH
ISSUE TO DEAL WITH.

11:37.250 --> 11:39.208
AH.

11:39.208 --> 11:40.250
WE'RE CATERING
A WEDDING.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.291
I TOLD, UM, JACK
I WOULD HELP OUT.

11:42.291 --> 11:43.917
GOOD.
TELL YOUR PARENTS
I SAID HELLO.

11:43.917 --> 11:46.291
YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE
TO TELL THEM YOURSELF.

11:46.291 --> 11:46.834
THEY'RE GUESTS
OF THE WEDDING
ON SATURDAY.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.041
WOW. SO YOUR DAD'S BACK.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.583
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?

11:53.583 --> 11:55.959
TOTAL SURPRISE.

11:55.959 --> 11:56.458
THAT'S GOT TO BE
A LOT TO DEAL WITH.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.750
HOW YOU DOIN'?

12:00.667 --> 12:01.917
I'M OK.

12:01.917 --> 12:02.834
OK?

12:02.834 --> 12:04.542
I MEAN,
I WAS KIND OF

12:04.542 --> 12:06.083
ON AN EMOTIONAL
OVERLOAD
THIS MORNING,

12:06.083 --> 12:07.250
BUT, UH,

12:07.250 --> 12:08.375
I RAN INTO JACK,

12:08.375 --> 12:10.166
AND WITH HIS
TYPICALLY INTUITIVE
INSIGHT,

12:10.166 --> 12:12.000
HE WAS ABLE
TO CALM ME DOWN.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.500
GREAT.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.583
I WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU,

12:16.583 --> 12:17.458
BUT THEN I HAD
TO CUT SCHOOL EARLY

12:17.458 --> 12:20.000
TO COME HERE
TO HELP OUT.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.208
TASTE THIS.

12:23.208 --> 12:24.750
IT'S HORSERADISH-
ENCRUSTED SALMON.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.000
WE'RE SERVING IT
AT THE WEDDING.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.375
Woman Customer:
AFTER WHAT HE DID
TO THEIR MOTHER?

12:29.375 --> 12:30.583
HE WAS CHEATING
ON HER

12:30.583 --> 12:33.041
WHILE THAT POOR WOMAN
WAS DYING OF CANCER.

12:33.041 --> 12:34.291
I DON'T THINK
HE SHOULD EVER

12:34.291 --> 12:36.125
BE ALLOWED BACK
INTO CAPESIDE.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.208
I MEAN,
HE'S A DRUG DEALER
FOR GOODNESS SAKE.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.625
Second Woman:
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.208
WELL, THAT'S
CAPESIDE FOR YOU.

12:45.291 --> 12:46.750
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO GET
BACK INTO THE KITCHEN,

12:46.750 --> 12:48.166
BUT THANK YOU
FOR HELPING OUT
THIS WEEKEND.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.208
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

12:49.208 --> 12:50.291
JOEY, ARE YOU--

12:50.291 --> 12:51.959
JOEY.

12:59.458 --> 13:01.417
OK, PACEY
AND ANDIE,

13:01.417 --> 13:02.250
IF YOU CAN TAKE CARE
OF THE WEDDING CAKE

13:02.250 --> 13:03.166

THE BUFFET TABLE.

13:03.166 --> 13:04.750
JACK AND DAWSON,
IF YOU CAN TAKE CARE

13:04.750 --> 13:06.250
OF THE CHAMPAGNE
AND THE APPETIZERS,

13:06.250 --> 13:08.250
AND IF THERE ARE
ANY CATASTROPHES,
JUST COME TO ME.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.250
I'LL EITHER BE
IN THE KITCHEN

13:09.250 --> 13:10.458
OR OUT ON THE FLOOR.

13:10.458 --> 13:12.083
BESSIE, THE GUESTS
ARE ALREADY STARTING
TO ARRIVE.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.208
WE'RE GONNA SURVIVE
THIS, RIGHT?

13:13.208 --> 13:15.458
OF COURSE WE WILL.
JUST RELAX
AND BREATHE.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.333
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO BREATHE.

13:17.333 --> 13:18.291
JOEY, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

13:18.291 --> 13:20.083
ABOUT THOSE WOMEN
AT THE ICE HOUSE.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.208
WHAT ABOUT THEM,
DAWSON?

13:21.208 --> 13:23.000
THEY'RE JUST YOUR AVERAGE
CAPESIDE IGNORAMUSES.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.708
WHAT DO THEY KNOW?
AND IT'S BOUND TO HAPPEN

13:24.708 --> 13:27.208
WHEN YOUR FATHER'S
AN INFAMOUS PHILANDERER
AND DRUG DEALER.

13:27.208 --> 13:28.000
ARE YOU OK THOUGH?
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.125
I'M FINE.
DAWSON, I'M FINE.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.333
HONESTLY, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THOSE IDIOTIC WOMEN.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.417
THERE ARE A HUNDRED PEOPLE
OUT THERE WAITING TO EAT,

13:34.417 --> 13:35.625
AND AT THIS POINT,
GETTING THEM FED

13:35.625 --> 13:37.708
IS THE ONLY THING
ON MY MIND.

13:37.708 --> 13:39.875

13:39.875 --> 13:41.583
THANK YOU.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.708
HEY, DAWSON.
HAVE YOU SEEN
YOUR FATHER?

13:53.708 --> 13:55.458
NO, I HAVEN'T.

13:55.458 --> 13:57.166
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT

13:57.166 --> 13:59.250
THAT I SHOULD TAKE
SOME OF MY OWN
ADVICE.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.834
I'VE DECIDED
THIS HAS GONE ON
LONG ENOUGH.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.333
I'M GONNA GET
YOUR FATHER BACK.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.291
WELL,

14:05.291 --> 14:06.542

SWEETHEART?

14:33.333 --> 14:34.834
I MEAN,
CAN'T YOU JUST FEEL
THE ANTICIPATORY

14:34.834 --> 14:36.000

14:36.000 --> 14:36.834

ABOUT TO BE UNITED

14:36.834 --> 14:39.750
IN THE BONDS
OF HOLY MATRIMONY.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.375
I THINK I'M GETTING
GOOSEBUMPS.

14:41.375 --> 14:42.458
HOW ABOUT YOU?

14:42.458 --> 14:43.500
YEAH, DON'T PUSH ME.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.291
I'VE GOT
A CAKE KNIFE
IN MY HAND, PACEY.

14:45.291 --> 14:46.125
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET THIS THING
FINISHED OFF,

14:46.125 --> 14:47.750
AND THEN WE CAN
GET OUT THERE

14:47.750 --> 14:48.583
AND WATCH THE CEREMONY.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.959
I'M NOT WATCHING
THE CEREMONY.

14:49.959 --> 14:51.166

YOU KNOW,

14:56.667 --> 14:57.708
I WISH I HAD MONEY
LIKE THESE PEOPLE.

14:57.708 --> 14:59.375
WHEN SOMEBODY
IN MY FAMILY
GETS MARRIED,

14:59.375 --> 15:00.375
YOU END UP
WEARING POLYESTER,

15:00.375 --> 15:02.041
THEY SERVE FISH STICKS
FOR APPETIZERS,

15:02.041 --> 15:04.125
AND THE WHOLE THING
WINDS UP IN A DRUNKEN
BRAWL.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.250
WHEN YOU GOT MONEY,

15:05.250 --> 15:07.500

MOMENTS LIKE THIS PERFECT.

BENEATH THE SURFACE,

15:13.667 --> 15:14.750
AND YOU WILL FIND
ESTRANGEMENT,

15:14.750 --> 15:17.041

WHAT'S HAPPENING?

18:48.458 --> 18:50.125
THIS WEDDING IS RAPIDLY
BECOMING A DISASTER.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.291
JACK AND DAWSON
DISAPPEARED,

18:51.291 --> 18:53.333
PACEY AND ANDIE
JUST RUINED THE CAKE,

18:53.333 --> 18:54.166
AND THE FOOD
ISN'T EVEN READY YET.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.792
JOEY,
JUST CALM DOWN.

18:55.792 --> 18:57.041
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.208
NO. JACK WAS RIGHT.
I THINK, BESSIE,

18:58.208 --> 18:59.083
WE HAVE ENOUGH
TO DEAL WITH
NOW THAT DAD'S BACK

18:59.083 --> 19:02.125
WITHOUT TAKING ON
THIS WEDDING.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.041
I MEAN, WE WERE BLINDED
BY THE FANTASY

19:03.041 --> 19:05.291
OF JUST PAYING OFF
ALL OUR DEBTS,

19:05.291 --> 19:07.291
AND WE OVERLOOKED
THE NOW PAINFULLY
OBVIOUS REALITY

19:07.291 --> 19:08.959
THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

19:08.959 --> 19:10.125
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

19:10.125 --> 19:11.583
EVERYTHING'S
UNDER CONTROL.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.291
WE'RE JUST
EXPERIENCING
A FEW GLITCHES.

19:13.291 --> 19:14.792
A FEW GLITCHES?

19:14.792 --> 19:15.667
BESSIE, WE ARE GOING
TO RUIN THIS WEDDING

19:15.667 --> 19:17.417
AND HUMILIATE OURSELVES
YET AGAIN

19:17.417 --> 19:20.125
IN FRONT OF
ALL OF CAPESIDE.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.125
THE STORY
OF OUR LIVES.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.291
NO. IT'S NOT
OVER YET,

19:22.291 --> 19:23.375
AND WE CAN DO THIS,

19:23.375 --> 19:24.834
AND I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD GET DAD

19:24.834 --> 19:25.667
ALL WORKED UP
ABOUT IT--

19:25.667 --> 19:26.834
WHY NOT?

19:26.834 --> 19:28.125
THIS WAS HIS BRIGHT IDEA
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.500
I MEAN, HE TORE
OUR FAMILY APART,

19:30.500 --> 19:32.291
AND HE THINKS HE CAN
JUST PUT IT BACK
TOGETHER IN A DAY.

19:32.291 --> 19:33.667
WELL, IT--HE CAN'T.

20:01.875 --> 20:06.959
[ORGAN PLAYING]

20:14.667 --> 20:16.250
IF YOU DON'T
OPEN UP THE DOOR,

20:16.250 --> 20:18.834
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO GET YOUR MOTHER.

20:20.875 --> 20:21.917
IT WAS WORTH A TRY.

20:21.917 --> 20:25.000
[DOOR UNLOCKS]

20:31.375 --> 20:33.041
HEY.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.542

H-HOW--
HOW YOU DOING?

20:39.792 --> 20:41.208
I'M GONNA BE SICK.

20:41.208 --> 20:42.792
UH...

20:42.792 --> 20:44.500
Y--ARE YOU HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS?

20:45.917 --> 20:48.667
I KEEP THINKING,

20:48.667 --> 20:50.917
WHAT IF ALAN
ISN'T MY SOUL MATE?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.083
I MEAN,
WHAT IF MY SOUL MATE
IS STILL OUT THERE,

20:53.083 --> 20:55.667
I JUST HAVEN'T
MET HIM YET,

20:55.667 --> 20:57.750
AND NOW I'M GIVING UP
MY ONE CHANCE

20:57.750 --> 20:59.458
FOR PERFECT LOVE?

20:59.458 --> 21:00.583
YOU COULD SPEND
YOUR WHOLE LIFE

21:00.583 --> 21:01.750
LOOKING
FOR A PERFECT LOVE,

21:01.750 --> 21:02.417
AND I PROMISE YOU,

21:02.417 --> 21:04.250
YOU'LL NEVER
FIND IT.

21:04.250 --> 21:05.834
[SOBS]

21:05.834 --> 21:07.750
UM...

21:07.750 --> 21:09.792
NO--NO. IT'S 'CAUSE
LOVE ISN'T PERFECT.

21:16.834 --> 21:18.250

THAT HE LOVES YOU,

21:19.291 --> 21:20.708
AND THAT LOVE IS
REAL.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.583
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT TO WALK AWAY

21:22.583 --> 21:24.166
FROM SOMETHING
THAT'S REAL

21:24.166 --> 21:26.375
FOR A PIPE DREAM
THAT MAY NOT EXIST?

HUH?

21:32.583 --> 21:33.708
HERE. COME ON.

21:33.708 --> 21:35.083
YOU'RE JUST
SUFFERING FROM
AN ACUTE CASE

21:35.083 --> 21:37.625
OF WEDDING-DAY
JITTERS.

21:37.625 --> 21:39.041
IT WOULDN'T
BE A WEDDING
WITHOUT 'EM.

21:39.041 --> 21:40.000
IT'S TRADITION,
YOU KNOW?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.917
IT'S LIKE THROWING
THE BOUQUET

21:41.917 --> 21:44.542
OR TAKING OFF
THE GARTER.

21:44.542 --> 21:45.875

START TO WALK DOWN

INTO ALAN'S EYES...

23:31.208 --> 23:32.333

WANTED TO TALK ABOUT,

YOU SHOULD DRAW
ANY CONCLUSIONS

23:41.542 --> 23:43.750
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH JOEY

23:43.750 --> 23:45.834
BASED ON SOMETHING
SO CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

23:45.834 --> 23:48.000
BESIDES, I MAY BE
FRIENDS WITH HER,

23:48.000 --> 23:49.583
BUT YOU'RE
HER SOUL MATE.

23:52.166 --> 23:54.625
YOU JUST TOLD THE BRIDE
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN SOUL MATES.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.917
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN PERFECT LOVE,

23:58.917 --> 24:00.625
BUT I DO BELIEVE
THAT THERE
ARE PEOPLE

24:00.625 --> 24:04.250
WHOSE LIVES
ARE INEXTRICABLY
INTERTWINED,

24:04.250 --> 24:07.083

A BOND THAT LASTS
FOREVER,

24:07.083 --> 24:08.959
CAN NEVER BE BROKEN.

24:08.959 --> 24:11.917
AND SHE NEEDS YOU
NOW, MAN.

THAT KNOWS HER WHOLE
HISTORY, OK?

YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
THAT KNOWS

WHAT SHE'S
GOING THROUGH.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.333
I KNOW,

24:17.333 --> 24:19.125
AND IT IS SO
FRUSTRATING.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.041
I KEEP ON
REACHING OUT TO HER,

24:20.041 --> 24:21.417
BUT, YOU KNOW,
BETWEEN HER PRIDE,

24:21.417 --> 24:24.041
THIS WEDDING,
I MEAN, IT'S JUST--

24:24.041 --> 24:25.875
I CAN'T CONNECT.

24:27.166 --> 24:32.166
MAYBE WHAT SHE NEEDS
IS FOR YOU TO FORCE
A CONNECTION.

OH, MY GOD.
HURRY UP,
THEY'RE COMING.

24:36.792 --> 24:39.667

24:55.792 --> 24:56.959
IT'S VERY BAD LUCK
FOR THE BRIDE

24:56.959 --> 24:58.250
TO SEE
HER WEDDING CAKE
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

24:58.250 --> 25:00.125

25:00.125 --> 25:00.750
SHE'LL GET FAT.

25:00.750 --> 25:03.458
OHH.
UH, THEY SAY.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.041
NO, THE ONLY THING
I'VE HEARD IS THAT
THE, UH,

REPRESENTS THE MARRIAGE.

25:08.291 --> 25:10.375

PUT IT IN THE FREEZER

THAT'S AN OMEN.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.208
IF THEIR MARRIAGE
BREAKS UP,

25:20.208 --> 25:21.166
IT WILL BE OUR FAULT.

25:21.166 --> 25:22.500
OUR FAULT?

25:22.500 --> 25:24.417
I THINK YOU MEAN
YOUR FAULT.

WILD GESTICULATIONS

25:26.000 --> 25:27.917

THIS BABY FLYING
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

25:27.917 --> 25:28.875
OHH, GOD.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.000
WHEN SHE COMES BACK IN
TO CUT THE CAKE,

25:31.000 --> 25:32.333
SHE'S GOING TO BE
HORRIFIED.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.708
OH, I KNEW I SHOULD NOT
HAVE COME.

25:34.708 --> 25:36.000
I MEAN, NOT ONLY

25:36.000 --> 25:37.125
HAVE I WRECKED
THEIR WEDDING,

25:37.125 --> 25:38.041
NO, BUT I'VE PLACED A CURSE
ON THEIR MARRIAGE.

25:38.041 --> 25:39.792
ANDIE, WOULD YOU
SETTLE DOWN? PLEASE?

25:39.792 --> 25:40.834
WEREN'T YOU THE ONE
WHO WAS JUST

25:40.834 --> 25:42.041
RAILING AGAINST
EMPTY SYMBOLISM
ANYHOW?

25:42.041 --> 25:44.542
YEAH, BUT YOUR WEDDING DAY
IS SUPPOSED TO BE PERFECT.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.375
I MEAN,
LOOK AT THAT CAKE.

ITSY-BITSY GROOM

IS COVERED
IN FROSTING.

25:50.708 --> 25:52.458

25:53.250 --> 25:54.542
I'M NOT WORKING
ON THIS CAKE

25:54.542 --> 25:55.542
FOR ONE MORE MINUTE,

25:55.542 --> 25:56.750
UNTIL YOU ADMIT TO ME

25:56.750 --> 25:58.041
THAT YOU ARE A CLOSET
WEDDING ROMANTIC.

25:58.041 --> 26:01.208
I AM NOT.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.667
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU,

26:02.667 --> 26:03.500
IT'S--IT'S
A BUNCH OF BOGUS,

CONVENTIONS.

26:10.834 --> 26:12.125
OH, MY GOD.
THE GROOM.

26:12.125 --> 26:13.417

26:14.458 --> 26:15.583
COME ON.

26:15.583 --> 26:17.417
UNH.

26:17.417 --> 26:19.959
OK, I ADMIT IT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:19.959 --> 26:21.250
I'M A SUCKER
FOR TAFFETA,

26:21.250 --> 26:22.542
THE SIGHT
OF THE LITTLE
FLOWER GIRL

26:22.542 --> 26:23.708
MAKES ME WEEPY,

26:23.708 --> 26:25.792
I'M A WEDDING
FANATIC.

26:25.792 --> 26:26.917
THERE.
ARE YOU HAPPY?

26:26.917 --> 26:28.583
HUH?

26:28.583 --> 26:31.000
HURRY UP. THE CAKE.

26:37.125 --> 26:38.125
HI, DAD.

26:38.125 --> 26:39.959
HEY.

26:39.959 --> 26:42.542
I THINK WE'RE,
UH, PRETTY MUCH
CAUGHT UP HERE.

26:42.542 --> 26:43.542
WHERE THERE'S
A WILL,

26:43.542 --> 26:45.417
THE POTTERS WILL
FIND A WAY.

26:45.417 --> 26:46.750
IT LOOKS AMAZING.

26:48.834 --> 26:50.000
JOEY,

26:50.000 --> 26:51.875
WHEN YOU SPEND
3 YEARS ALONE
IN A PRISON CELL,

26:51.875 --> 26:55.583
IT CAN MAKE YOU
MONSTROUSLY
SELF-ABSORBED,

26:55.583 --> 26:57.375
AND I NEVER
EVEN CONSIDERED

26:57.375 --> 26:59.333
HOW MY PRESENCE HERE

26:59.333 --> 27:00.583
WOULD ADVERSELY
AFFECT YOU.

27:00.583 --> 27:01.500
DAD,

27:01.500 --> 27:04.667
I'M REALLY
STRESSED OUT.

27:04.667 --> 27:05.750
I DIDN'T MEAN
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

27:05.750 --> 27:08.542
WELL, WHETHER
YOU DID OR DIDN'T,

27:08.542 --> 27:10.959
YOU WERE COMPLETELY
RIGHT.

27:10.959 --> 27:14.125
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN
SO STRONG

27:14.125 --> 27:17.250
AND, UH,
HAVE DONE SO WELL,

27:17.250 --> 27:19.125
AND HERE COMES YOUR
CRIMINAL FATHER,

27:19.125 --> 27:20.291
COMING BACK
TO CAPESIDE

27:20.291 --> 27:22.500
JUST TO BRING YOU
MORE SHAME AND SCANDAL.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.041
DADDY,

27:24.041 --> 27:26.542
YOU CAN'T EXPECT
TO COME BACK AND--

27:26.542 --> 27:28.959
AND HAVE EVERYTHING
BE NORMAL AGAIN.

27:28.959 --> 27:31.000
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.417
I THINK WE NEED
TO DEAL WITH THEM
AS A FAMILY

27:33.417 --> 27:35.333
BEFORE WE INVITE IN
THE MALIGNANT SCRUTINY

27:35.333 --> 27:38.083
OF TOTAL STRANGERS.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.959
I'M THE FATHER.

27:40.959 --> 27:42.125
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE
PROTECTING YOU

27:42.125 --> 27:43.708
AGAINST ALL
THE HARSH REALITIES
OF THE WORLD,

27:43.708 --> 27:47.125
AND HERE YOU ARE
PROTECTING ME.

27:49.625 --> 27:51.917
YET AGAIN,
I'M FAILING IN MY
PARENTAL DUTIES.

27:54.834 --> 27:56.667
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

27:56.667 --> 27:59.750
I BETTER GO CHECK
ON THAT SALMON.

28:06.333 --> 28:09.291
THANK YOU.

28:09.291 --> 28:10.166

PERFECT.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.041
PROBABLY FELT
THE SAME WAY, TOO.

31:43.041 --> 31:44.041
THAT AS SOON
AS HE GOT BACK,

31:44.041 --> 31:45.208
HE COULD JUST
CLEAN UP EVERY MESS

31:45.208 --> 31:47.083
AND RIGHT
EVERY WRONG...

GET TO YOU NOW.

YOUR HEELS
AND TO SHOW THEM

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

MELISSA BERRY?

33:39.500 --> 33:42.834
SHE ALWAYS WORE HER HAIR
ON TOP OF HER HEAD
IN A PONYTAIL.

A FRIEND OF YOURS.

33:44.875 --> 33:46.750

ARRESTED, UM...

IN THE BATHROOM...

33:58.000 --> 34:00.166

34:00.166 --> 34:02.166
I OVERHEARD HER
TALKING ABOUT YOU...

34:02.166 --> 34:05.250
ABOUT, UM, HOW YOU
WERE A DRUG DEALER

34:05.250 --> 34:07.291

IN A CRACK HOUSE,

34:07.291 --> 34:08.708
AND SHE WAS LAUGHING.
AND...

34:08.708 --> 34:12.417
I REMEMBER I WAS SO UPSET,
I RAN HOME, AND I CRIED
FOR HOURS.

34:12.417 --> 34:15.041
AND DAWSON CAME OVER
AND CHEERED ME UP.

34:17.041 --> 34:20.166
THE NEXT DAY,
I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL,

34:20.166 --> 34:23.875
AND I WALKED UP TO HER,
AND I LOOKED HER
STRAIGHT IN THE EYES...

34:23.875 --> 34:25.333
AND I SMILED.

34:25.333 --> 34:28.208

HAD EVER HAPPENED.

HAVE ALREADY SUNK
INTO THE SEA, SO...

WILL YOU DANCE
WITH ME?

39:32.834 --> 39:34.166

39:44.959 --> 39:47.542
YOU KNOW,
A VERY WISE PERSON

THAT...KNOWING
WHAT YOU WANT
IS HALF THE BATTLE.

THE TRICK IS
TO STAY TENACIOUS...

39:54.750 --> 39:58.959
AND NOT LET
ANY MINOR SETBACK
DERAIL YOUR VISION.

40:00.041 --> 40:01.583

HONEY.

IT'S OVER. I MEAN,
