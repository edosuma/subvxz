01:32.780 --> 01:36.250
When you're looking
at petawatts,

01:36.260 --> 01:37.719
at petawattage, you've gotta be

01:37.720 --> 01:39.720
really clear about how much
power and how much...

01:39.730 --> 01:41.559
not only the logistics
of it, but...

01:41.560 --> 01:43.559
you just stick to writing
your books, honey, okay?

01:43.560 --> 01:45.199
- I know it's...
- I'm done with you.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.229
- I'm very sorry.
- We're very, very close.

01:47.230 --> 01:50.199
We've mixed up a couple of
verbals, it's not quite there yet,

01:50.200 --> 01:52.269
but we are so close,
i just know it,

01:52.270 --> 01:53.800
I can feel it in my bones.

02:06.850 --> 02:09.150
You just gotta think
of all the possibilities

02:09.160 --> 02:11.159
that parallel worlds offer us.

02:11.160 --> 02:16.259
I mean, some worlds are gonna
be extremely different to ours.

02:16.260 --> 02:18.329
There'll be universes
where there's no life.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.729
There'll be universes
where there'll be no earth,

02:20.730 --> 02:22.499
or no solar system.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.299
There'll be universes
where there would be

02:24.300 --> 02:26.739
people just like us,
and almost identical.

02:26.740 --> 02:28.660
You wouldn't be able
to distinguish them from us.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.579
So, it's an amazing range
of possibilities

02:33.580 --> 02:36.579
that are gonna offer
all sorts of spinoffs, as well.

02:36.580 --> 02:38.849
The whole idea of traveling
between the universes

02:38.850 --> 02:41.549
is pretty wonderful.

02:41.550 --> 02:43.689
There are people in Japan
working on it,

02:43.690 --> 02:45.619
and in Russia,

02:45.620 --> 02:47.759
of course the military
are very interested.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.329
Darpa, the American organization

02:50.330 --> 02:53.860
that works with developing
technology for the military

02:53.870 --> 02:55.969
are very keen, because sadly

02:55.970 --> 02:58.769
it can be used
as some sort of weapon...

02:58.770 --> 03:00.600
- I'm home!
- Hello.

03:04.740 --> 03:06.679
- Oh, mom, they're mine.
- Thanks, darling.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.609
That's gross.

03:08.610 --> 03:11.219
- How was your run?
- Oh, it was torture.

03:11.220 --> 03:12.580
I hate exercise.

03:12.590 --> 03:14.480
So, no French toast
for you then, huh?

03:14.490 --> 03:15.789
- Hey? Huh?
- What?

03:15.790 --> 03:17.450
Get out!

03:17.460 --> 03:20.420
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You're in training, fatty.

03:20.430 --> 03:21.989
There are choices.

03:21.990 --> 03:23.629
- Choices.
- Screw you.

03:23.630 --> 03:25.299
Huh? Come on.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.329
- Let's go, you two.
- I'll have a shower first.

03:27.330 --> 03:28.799
- Lunch, usual spot?
- Perfect.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.270
Let's go!

03:47.420 --> 03:50.250
Just... it'll be
ready soon, I promise.

03:50.260 --> 03:53.520
Yeah, I know,
it just... it takes time.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.890
Look... no, no, no,
we're been logging all that.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.869
Yes. Yeah, I sent the report
through last week.

04:02.870 --> 04:04.669
It's kind of not my department.

04:04.670 --> 04:07.700
Um, yeah, absolutely.

04:07.710 --> 04:11.579
Look, look, with all due
respect, it's really not...

04:11.580 --> 04:15.279
Dawkins, hi, yes...

04:15.280 --> 04:18.449
yes, I am absolutely aware

04:18.450 --> 04:19.918
we have passed the deadline,

04:19.920 --> 04:23.919
but we are so close.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.919
No, there's no
positive results yet,

04:25.920 --> 04:28.590
but in theory we...

04:31.060 --> 04:36.330
no, I understand.
Yes, a month.

04:36.340 --> 04:39.639
Thank you.
I'll be in touch.

04:39.640 --> 04:43.839
- I hate them pushing me like that.
- What, a month?

04:43.840 --> 04:46.779
- Yup.
- Jesus.

04:46.780 --> 04:51.849
Well, luckily today
i am wearing my special shirt.

04:51.850 --> 04:56.020
- Doesn't that need a wash?
- Well, I would then wash out the mojo.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.559
All right, have you got
the parameters set?

05:00.560 --> 05:02.029
Yeah, but can you
double check them?

05:02.030 --> 05:04.059
I don't want to be blamed
for any mistakes.

05:04.060 --> 05:06.729
Oh, shut up.

05:06.730 --> 05:09.830
All right, we'll aim
for six second teleport.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.569
Roger that.

05:12.570 --> 05:14.940
Place the subject
in the center, please.

05:28.450 --> 05:31.020
...Coils
are fully charged.

05:38.660 --> 05:41.569
- Any sign of trouble, abort, okay?
- Got it.

05:41.570 --> 05:44.970
We'll start at 50 petawatts.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.940
I'm going to 100.

05:55.910 --> 05:57.480
Okay, your side?

05:58.580 --> 05:59.919
Yup, all good.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.120
Okay.

06:07.630 --> 06:10.490
Going to 150.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.060
Slowly.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.540
Regg, take it offline.

06:40.630 --> 06:41.690
Bummer.

07:19.630 --> 07:22.529
I almost blew
the whole system today.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.030
Ouch.

07:24.040 --> 07:27.639
Dawkins is threatening
to shut us down in a month.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.070
What?

07:30.080 --> 07:33.140
It's been five years...

07:35.180 --> 07:38.919
- And he could just shut it down.
- But you're close, right?

07:38.920 --> 07:41.889
Yes, no, i think so.

07:41.890 --> 07:43.850
How close are the Japanese?

07:43.860 --> 07:45.519
Don't even talk
to me about that.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.859
The money they have,
the facilities they have,

07:47.860 --> 07:49.760
we're a tiny little outfit.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.199
- They're not there yet.
- No, they're not,

07:54.200 --> 07:58.669
but the deadlines are stupid,
breathing down our neck.

07:58.670 --> 08:01.569
- How are we supposed to get anything done?
- Mm-hmm, I understand.

08:01.570 --> 08:03.810
My publisher always wants
the book, like, yesterday.

08:09.010 --> 08:13.020
Why do I just wanna
run away sometimes?

08:14.790 --> 08:17.219
Cause you're impatient.

08:17.220 --> 08:18.920
That's all.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.890
If I did, would you
come with me?

08:22.900 --> 08:23.990
No.

08:50.820 --> 08:53.890
Well, that's me.

08:55.830 --> 08:58.229
I'm out.

08:58.230 --> 09:00.629
- You?
- No, I'm fine.

09:00.630 --> 09:01.899
I'm gonna stay on.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.169
The night is young!

09:04.170 --> 09:06.200
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.610
Mmm.

09:22.750 --> 09:25.159
I'm so sorry I'm late.

09:25.160 --> 09:28.159
Do you think we could
have some takeaway?

09:28.160 --> 09:30.690
No need. Your sister dropped by
with lasagna.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.759
- It's in the oven.
- Lasagna?

09:32.760 --> 09:34.129
Why did she do that?

09:34.130 --> 09:35.869
Thought you needed fattening up.

09:35.870 --> 09:38.799
Oh, shut up.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.600
Okay.

09:40.610 --> 09:42.710
We're having an affair.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.609
What?

09:46.610 --> 09:47.640
You wouldn't dare.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.279
Why?

09:49.280 --> 09:50.349
Dad?

09:50.350 --> 09:53.780
Oh, give me an out.

09:53.790 --> 09:55.149
Yes, Jake?

09:55.150 --> 09:56.650
The Internet's not working.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.050
Read a book!

09:58.060 --> 09:59.920
So commercial teleportation

09:59.930 --> 10:01.220
is just around the next corner.

10:01.230 --> 10:03.690
There are teams
in Japan working on it,

10:03.700 --> 10:05.299
and in Russia,

10:05.300 --> 10:07.029
but scientists have to be brave,

10:07.030 --> 10:08.669
and bold, and courageous,

10:08.670 --> 10:09.869
and take risks.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.870
I mean, that's what it's all...

10:13.700 --> 10:15.039
but scientists have to be brave,

10:15.040 --> 10:16.670
and bold, and courageous,

10:16.680 --> 10:18.840
and take risks.

10:38.060 --> 10:41.060
Okay, it's a final adjustment.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.230
Should be ready.

10:50.940 --> 10:53.209
I'm starting with 200 petawatts.

10:53.210 --> 10:54.440
Are you crazy?

10:54.450 --> 10:56.149
We could blow the grid.

10:56.150 --> 10:58.010
We don't have time
to be cautious, regg,

10:58.020 --> 10:59.680
- just do it.
- All right, but...

10:59.690 --> 11:02.290
I'm starting with 200 petawatts.

11:03.690 --> 11:06.260
Okay, taking it to 200.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.960
250.

11:20.170 --> 11:21.440
300.

11:38.020 --> 11:39.290
350.

11:56.370 --> 11:58.209
Holy shit.

11:58.210 --> 12:00.080
Oh, my god.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.820
Well, it should be in here.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.520
Where the hell is it?

12:15.930 --> 12:19.100
Uh... I'll check
the sensor data.

12:20.460 --> 12:22.369
It's just disappeared
into thin air.

12:22.370 --> 12:25.769
Some would call that magic.

12:25.770 --> 12:27.500
Just think what we've done.

12:27.510 --> 12:31.010
Just... just think
what we've done.

12:32.310 --> 12:37.950
We've... we've disassembled
organic matter.

12:39.350 --> 12:42.249
Is it too soon to celebrate?

12:42.250 --> 12:43.989
Well, technically,
we're only halfway there.

12:43.990 --> 12:46.790
Oh, my god, i need a drink.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.359
Matt?

13:26.360 --> 13:27.930
- Jane?
- Matt?

13:29.400 --> 13:30.830
Just... our kids.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.099
What's wrong?

13:32.100 --> 13:33.269
I love them.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.609
Where are you?

13:35.610 --> 13:37.409
I love you, Jane.

13:37.410 --> 13:38.509
Matt?

13:38.510 --> 13:40.140
Matt!

13:47.550 --> 13:50.350
Hi, you've called Matt.
I'm not here at the moment.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.889
Just leave a message, and I will
call you back as soon as I can.

13:53.890 --> 13:56.859
Have a nice day.

13:56.860 --> 13:58.360
What the hell?

14:01.330 --> 14:02.470
Oh, my god.

14:03.630 --> 14:05.240
Oh, my god!

16:11.000 --> 16:13.100
Mom?
Mom?

16:14.260 --> 16:18.599
- Mom! Mom, wake up!
- Oh, god.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.769
...What are you doing?

16:20.770 --> 16:24.139
Sorry. I'll get
some breakfast.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.439
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.679
- We can do it.
- Shush, I'll get some.

16:27.680 --> 16:31.650
It's all right. Let's have
some eggs or something.

16:34.090 --> 16:36.350
Mom, please, can you just stop?

16:56.410 --> 16:58.509
Do you guys wanna start
with your homework?

16:58.510 --> 17:00.440
I need to speak to your mom.

17:06.220 --> 17:07.819
Jane?

17:09.720 --> 17:12.089
Jane?

17:12.089 --> 17:14.259
- Jane.
- Oh.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.159
- Oh, oh, god, the kids!
- It's all right.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.390
It's all right.
They're downstairs.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.200
Jake phoned, i picked them up.

17:21.430 --> 17:23.730
Oh, Christ.

17:23.740 --> 17:26.439
Jane, I know that this is hard,

17:26.440 --> 17:29.409
you know, we all agreed that
the kids should go back to school

17:29.410 --> 17:31.539
after three weeks
to keep them busy.

17:31.540 --> 17:33.780
You need to do the same thing.

17:35.780 --> 17:39.380
I just don't think i can go on
without him, Ruth, I really don't.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.759
He was always there for me,

17:45.760 --> 17:50.090
and I was just always
wrapped up in my own work.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.130
Don't be so hard on yourself.

17:55.430 --> 17:59.239
The worst thing
is that when he called me,

17:59.240 --> 18:02.309
ruthie, he said he loved me,

18:02.310 --> 18:05.209
he said he loved the kids,

18:05.210 --> 18:10.110
and I didn't get to say
that I love you back.

18:13.850 --> 18:16.220
Oh, god.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.559
Jane.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.290
It'll be okay.

18:53.460 --> 18:55.890
With the other link
the receiver.

19:02.470 --> 19:03.830
Then...

19:09.170 --> 19:11.270
...Jane.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.809
Yeah, listen, I've been running
through the data on our last test.

19:14.810 --> 19:16.379
Yeah?

19:16.380 --> 19:19.319
What if the apple did make it
to the receiver?

19:19.320 --> 19:21.849
But... but it didn't.
The chamber was empty.

19:21.850 --> 19:25.519
- Remember?
- No our chamber was empty, regg.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.259
I'm not following.

19:28.260 --> 19:29.829
You've heard
of tegmark's theory?

19:29.830 --> 19:33.899
What? Of parallel worlds?

19:33.900 --> 19:35.600
Oh, hey...

19:37.270 --> 19:38.699
what are you saying?

19:38.700 --> 19:40.370
I'll see you in ten.

19:41.770 --> 19:44.670
I've crosschecked the data,

19:44.680 --> 19:47.209
- you could be right.
- I am right.

19:47.210 --> 19:51.380
I think we sent an apple
to a parallel world.

19:52.780 --> 19:55.819
I don't know, I can't even
begin to comprehend...

19:55.820 --> 19:59.589
and if we are right,
there should be

19:59.590 --> 20:02.459
one of these chambers,
and scientists studying

20:02.460 --> 20:04.259
everything that we're studying

20:04.260 --> 20:06.330
in that parallel world.

20:07.730 --> 20:09.599
Yeah, but you're assuming
it's a level one,

20:09.600 --> 20:11.669
or a level three parallel world,
in tegmark's theory,

20:11.670 --> 20:14.500
but if it's a level two world,
then our laws of physics

20:14.510 --> 20:16.809
- may not even apply.
- Listen, for our purposes,

20:16.810 --> 20:19.339
let's just assume
it's a level one or three world.

20:19.340 --> 20:20.840
In which case, my question is,

20:20.850 --> 20:24.579
why haven't they sent
something back?

20:24.580 --> 20:25.680
Um...

20:27.520 --> 20:31.919
maybe... maybe they've got
the wrong frequency.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.359
Maybe?

20:33.360 --> 20:35.890
Maybe they haven't
cracked it yet.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.030
Let's send them our parameters.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.799
350 petawatts.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.039
Bi-shifted coils.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.869
36.9
that's it.

20:49.870 --> 20:51.610
No more. Just that.
Just send that.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.450
We'll send it at 350.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.329
Okay, your side, regg?

21:10.330 --> 21:11.690
Ready.

21:13.630 --> 21:15.669
300.

21:15.670 --> 21:17.530
It's going well.

21:17.540 --> 21:18.770
350.

21:33.450 --> 21:36.090
- What now?
- We wait.

21:39.920 --> 21:43.830
There is nothing like
a late breakfast.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.860
Mine's a bit burnt.

21:48.870 --> 21:51.430
A bit?
You're lucky.

21:54.410 --> 21:57.639
Well, as your dad used to say,

21:57.640 --> 22:01.110
extra flavor.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.549
- Regg?
- -Guess what?

22:07.550 --> 22:08.819
Don't mess with me.

22:08.820 --> 22:11.050
Just come down here.

22:11.060 --> 22:12.660
Tell me.

22:16.830 --> 22:18.129
Well?

22:18.130 --> 22:20.130
I haven't touched it.

22:28.870 --> 22:30.670
Is this some kind of joke?

22:30.680 --> 22:33.480
No!
No way.

22:58.540 --> 22:59.799
That's so funny.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.769
I wonder what
their world is like.

23:02.770 --> 23:04.609
Maybe they're more
advanced than us.

23:04.610 --> 23:07.010
Well, not likely.
We made the first move.

23:10.080 --> 23:15.549
The real question is...
i mean, who are they?

23:15.550 --> 23:16.950
Well, they're humanoid,
at least.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.190
There must be a better way
of communicating.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.560
Let's us this.

23:28.570 --> 23:31.530
This thing's an antique. You sure
they're gonna know how to use it?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.200
Shut up.
Get it in there.

23:36.210 --> 23:38.010
250.

23:57.930 --> 23:59.700
Oh, my god.

24:03.670 --> 24:05.700
Oh, my god.

24:11.980 --> 24:13.880
Plug it in.

24:19.950 --> 24:22.789
Oh!

24:22.790 --> 24:23.919
Our lab.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.819
It's them.

24:26.820 --> 24:29.989
- Whoa!
- Are they chambers?

24:29.990 --> 24:33.099
Here is our data collection.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.060
Oh wait, hang on, here we go.

24:35.070 --> 24:37.569
It's, um...

24:37.570 --> 24:38.669
whoa!

24:38.670 --> 24:40.600
I'm Jane Chandler.

24:40.610 --> 24:42.609
- Holy shit.
- Congratulations.

24:42.610 --> 24:45.070
We have been working on this
for a long time, and...

24:45.080 --> 24:47.679
- thanks for sending us the...
- that's... that's you.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.940
Parameters.

24:48.950 --> 24:52.249
Hi. What?
What are you doing here?

24:52.250 --> 24:54.980
Um, I've got...
I've gotta go. Bye.

24:54.990 --> 24:58.920
I mean, tegmark's right.
It is a parallel world.

25:00.990 --> 25:04.990
And... so everyone over there
is the same as here?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.199
Everyone.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.199
Everything slightly different.

25:08.200 --> 25:11.299
And there's another version
of me over there right now?

25:11.300 --> 25:13.070
Oh, heaven help us.

25:15.210 --> 25:16.309
Oh, my god.

25:16.310 --> 25:18.209
So... so what
do we do now?

25:18.210 --> 25:21.709
Uh, well, what can we do
from an ethical perspective?

25:21.710 --> 25:24.910
Well, it would be great to
find out more about their world.

25:24.920 --> 25:28.549
Maybe, you know, maybe they have
medical breakthroughs that we don't.

25:28.550 --> 25:29.989
Maybe they've got
cures for cancer. Maybe...

25:29.990 --> 25:32.890
I wonder what their
computer systems are like.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.160
We could go across.

25:39.300 --> 25:41.129
No, no way, that's way
too dangerous.

25:41.130 --> 25:42.329
What? Look,
the apple was fine.

25:42.330 --> 25:44.799
The camera went across,
came back.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.519
Files were completely intact.

25:45.531 --> 25:46.639
That's completely different.
It's an apple.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.239
How is it different?

25:48.240 --> 25:52.809
Well, if any of the parameters
fluctuate even by a micron

25:52.810 --> 25:56.609
during the process,
then our DNA will disassemble

25:56.610 --> 26:01.180
and it won't...
it won't be pretty.

26:01.190 --> 26:03.319
Yeah, you're right.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.750
This is too dangerous.

26:39.860 --> 26:42.190
If something were
to happen to me...

26:46.660 --> 26:52.199
would you... would you be able
to look after the kids?

26:52.200 --> 26:54.040
Jane, you're gonna be fine.

26:59.380 --> 27:02.080
It's just the worst case
scenario.

27:04.350 --> 27:07.680
Well, of course, I would
look after your kids.

27:07.690 --> 27:10.090
They're family, and I love them.

27:11.660 --> 27:13.920
And I love you, too, okay?

31:17.670 --> 31:19.569
No.

31:19.570 --> 31:21.670
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:26.210 --> 31:30.249
You're supposed to be dead.

31:30.250 --> 31:34.280
No. No, no.
I'm... I'm alive.

31:34.290 --> 31:35.519
And I'm fine.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.690
I'm going crazy.
I'm going crazy.

31:39.090 --> 31:40.590
And the kids are fine, too.

31:48.260 --> 31:50.070
We don't have kids.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.970
Hold on a minute.

32:01.610 --> 32:04.079
All right.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.149
You... you know
about my job,

32:06.150 --> 32:09.349
and the work that we're
trying to achieve at the lab?

32:09.350 --> 32:10.990
Right?

32:12.360 --> 32:15.059
It worked.

32:15.060 --> 32:17.959
Now, you just said
that... that I died,

32:17.960 --> 32:23.629
but in my world,
where I come from,

32:23.630 --> 32:27.569
you died in a car accident

32:27.570 --> 32:30.270
just about a mile from here.

32:31.710 --> 32:33.610
That's the way you died.

32:59.100 --> 33:02.000
- We have kids?
- We've got two.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.240
Can you take me there?

33:12.450 --> 33:14.650
Can you take me there?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.020
I can try.

34:05.570 --> 34:07.599
Oh, my god, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

34:07.600 --> 34:10.109
Oh, Jesus.
What have you done?

34:10.110 --> 34:12.570
- Oh.
- Will you just cool it?

34:12.580 --> 34:16.179
Cool it?
Are you mad?

34:16.179 --> 34:19.149
You can't just go dragging
people across the dimensions.

34:19.150 --> 34:22.179
Oh, can't I? Who's research
project is this, anyway?

34:22.190 --> 34:24.449
Oh, oh, wow.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.559
I mean, there are so many
things to consider here.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.089
There are ethics.
The quantum physics.

34:30.090 --> 34:32.489
I am well aware
of what's at stake.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.299
Oh, my god.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.329
How are you going to explain
that your husband

34:36.330 --> 34:38.699
is back from the dead?

34:40.739 --> 34:42.339
It's all fixable, regg.

34:42.340 --> 34:43.770
Fixable?

34:45.370 --> 34:47.840
What about your kids?

34:47.850 --> 34:49.540
I mean, what are
they gonna think?

34:49.550 --> 34:51.849
They want their
father back, regg.

34:51.850 --> 34:53.449
I'm okay.

34:58.420 --> 35:00.120
Jane.

35:03.630 --> 35:04.729
I'm home!

35:04.730 --> 35:06.190
Oh!

35:06.200 --> 35:07.729
- Oh, hello.
- What a surprise.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.669
Hi. Oh, look, ruthie...

35:10.670 --> 35:11.670
you look tired.

35:11.671 --> 35:12.899
- Thanks.
- You okay?

35:12.900 --> 35:14.399
Sorry.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.869
- Yeah?
- You know what? Why don't you...

35:15.870 --> 35:17.639
why don't you have
an early night

35:17.640 --> 35:20.239
because I thought I might
take the kids to the movies.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.379
- Sweet, yes.
- -Yes.

35:22.380 --> 35:24.710
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah?

35:24.720 --> 35:26.449
But don't...
but just leave it all...

35:26.450 --> 35:28.549
just walk away,
cause I can do it,

35:28.550 --> 35:31.250
and I'm so thankful.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.919
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.189
- You good?
- Yes, I'm good.

35:35.190 --> 35:36.459
- Beautiful.
- I love you.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.259
- You, too.
- -Bye-bye.

35:38.260 --> 35:40.529
- Bye. See ya.
- -Thank you.

35:40.530 --> 35:43.899
- Bye, I love you.
- -Geez, that was a bit sudden, mom.

35:43.900 --> 35:46.299
Oh, yes, yeah.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.599
It was.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.569
Um...

35:49.570 --> 35:51.270
Sammy, can you put that down?

35:51.280 --> 35:53.579
Yeah, just...

35:53.580 --> 35:56.549
I need to tell you something.

35:56.550 --> 35:59.549
You know... I've told you
a little bit about my work.

35:59.550 --> 36:02.249
Right? How we're working
to teleport things

36:02.250 --> 36:04.419
much like in...

36:04.420 --> 36:06.250
"Star Trek."

36:06.260 --> 36:08.489
We just could
make things disappear,

36:08.490 --> 36:10.329
but not reappear.

36:10.330 --> 36:13.199
Anyway, this is
our world, right?

36:13.200 --> 36:14.560
This is our universe.

36:14.570 --> 36:17.429
Scientists believe
that at the same time

36:17.430 --> 36:18.869
this world is existing,

36:18.870 --> 36:20.739
other worlds are existing,

36:20.740 --> 36:24.209
and scientists call them
parallel worlds, okay?

36:24.210 --> 36:26.270
Now, some of them
that they believe

36:26.280 --> 36:27.839
are vastly different from ours,

36:27.840 --> 36:29.540
but here's the really
important thing,

36:29.550 --> 36:32.210
is some of those universes,
some of those worlds,

36:32.220 --> 36:34.449
are really similar.

36:34.450 --> 36:36.589
And... and...
that's it.

36:36.590 --> 36:38.889
That's it, that's...
that's what we discovered.

36:38.890 --> 36:43.589
We figured out where
the apple went.

36:43.590 --> 36:49.329
And it went to a world
that was really similar to ours.

36:49.330 --> 36:53.640
And I know this,
because I went there.

36:55.940 --> 37:00.440
And when I went there,
i found dad.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.449
What do you mean
you found dad, mom?

37:06.450 --> 37:09.249
Well, it's just like an
identical version of your dad,

37:09.250 --> 37:12.350
because in his world,
you see, dad didn't die.

37:14.420 --> 37:15.889
You're being serious
about this, right?

37:15.890 --> 37:17.589
Would I joke about
something like this?

37:17.590 --> 37:18.929
Would I put you through it?

37:18.930 --> 37:21.499
Where is he now?
Is... is he here now?

37:21.500 --> 37:24.799
Well, he's down
the road in a car.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.399
That's why, you know,
i had to get rid of Ruth,

37:27.400 --> 37:29.000
but nobody can know this, Sam.

37:29.010 --> 37:32.010
- Down the road?
- Yeah, wait, Sam, wait!

37:33.810 --> 37:35.609
Where is he, mom?

37:35.610 --> 37:38.310
I... I don't know.
I... I left him here.

37:46.860 --> 37:48.460
Dad?

39:12.040 --> 39:14.940
I made some tea.

39:14.950 --> 39:16.509
And some sugar?

39:16.510 --> 39:17.850
Oh, I don't take it.

39:19.720 --> 39:21.620
Oh.

39:25.650 --> 39:29.059
You okay, Jake?

39:29.060 --> 39:30.760
Yeah, I'm...
I'm fine.

39:37.530 --> 39:40.639
Look, can we just
hang on for a second?

39:40.640 --> 39:43.409
I mean, if you're here,
doesn't that mean that the...

39:43.410 --> 39:46.910
the other Sam and the other me
in the other world...

39:48.140 --> 39:51.710
aren't they missing their dad?

39:51.720 --> 39:55.420
Oh, where I come from there
is no you and Samantha.

39:56.920 --> 40:00.420
But mom, I thought you said
everything was identical.

40:02.890 --> 40:05.759
Similar.
Not identical.

40:05.760 --> 40:09.660
Well, what about the other mom?

40:10.800 --> 40:12.830
Isn't she missing you?

40:12.840 --> 40:14.869
Isn't she?

40:14.870 --> 40:17.769
Look, I know this
is gonna sound weird,

40:17.770 --> 40:23.209
but in dad's world, I died
in a car accident, not dad.

40:23.210 --> 40:24.749
- What.
- What?

40:24.750 --> 40:27.719
It's okay, Sam,
I'm... I'm...

40:27.720 --> 40:30.119
listen, you know, I think that's
probably enough questions for now.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.989
- It's been a big couple of days.
- Yeah.

40:31.990 --> 40:33.050
I'm tired.

40:33.060 --> 40:34.619
Do you wanna lie down?

40:34.620 --> 40:35.759
Cause you could...
the bedroom...

40:35.760 --> 40:38.560
the second room on the right.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.729
The most important thing
is that we don't tell anyone

41:15.730 --> 41:18.930
that dad's back.

41:18.940 --> 41:20.999
Just don't want
to lose him again.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.740
Yeah, no worries, mom.

41:29.780 --> 41:32.010
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:37.820 --> 41:40.019
How are you feeling?

41:40.020 --> 41:41.690
I'm okay.

41:52.200 --> 41:53.970
I've missed you.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.950
Feels like a dream.

42:14.660 --> 42:17.930
Oh, to wake up and you be gone.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.969
I'm never gonna leave you.

42:24.970 --> 42:26.770
Promise me.

42:31.110 --> 42:33.040
I promise.

42:45.820 --> 42:49.320
How are the eggs?

42:49.330 --> 42:52.760
- Good.
- They're perfect.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.600
I'm home.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.270
- Oh.
- -Madame.

43:05.280 --> 43:08.610
Ooh, thank you.

43:27.130 --> 43:29.929
Jesus, you scared me.

43:29.930 --> 43:31.830
Oh, my god.

43:31.840 --> 43:35.200
Sorry. Didn't want
to disturb you.

43:35.210 --> 43:41.280
Well, you know, you could try
knocking next time.

43:44.810 --> 43:47.049
It's so beautiful here.

43:47.050 --> 43:49.020
It's nothing like my world.

43:55.790 --> 43:57.660
Are you happy?

44:05.930 --> 44:08.340
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

44:17.810 --> 44:22.919
- That really hurt!
- Sorry.

44:22.920 --> 44:24.389
The other Jane
used to like that.

44:24.390 --> 44:28.059
Well, I'm not the other Jane.

44:28.060 --> 44:30.990
- Come here.
- Oh, my god.

44:53.250 --> 44:54.350
Mmm.

45:14.940 --> 45:17.839
What's that?

45:17.840 --> 45:20.510
Well, that's self defense.

45:22.240 --> 45:24.079
Self defense against what?

45:24.080 --> 45:28.750
Well, my world is violent.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.119
How's it work?

45:32.120 --> 45:33.990
Fires a charge.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.459
What, like a taser?

45:37.460 --> 45:39.990
...Careful.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.799
It's got quite a kick.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.300
Hmm.

45:55.040 --> 45:58.379
All he does is play video games.
I can hear through my wall.

45:58.380 --> 46:00.279
He says, "oh, mom,
I'm studying."

46:00.280 --> 46:03.180
And, yet, I can hear it
through my wall late at night.

46:03.190 --> 46:05.419
You don't have to study
when you already know it.

46:05.420 --> 46:07.459
Oh, "you don't have to study
when you already know it."

46:07.460 --> 46:09.889
- I do the work at school.
- Said every fail ever.

46:09.890 --> 46:12.330
He's got apps that are right,
but that, you know.

46:19.840 --> 46:21.539
- Grandma, hi.
- Jake.

46:21.540 --> 46:22.939
How are you, my darling?

46:22.940 --> 46:24.069
- I'm good.
- How's your mother?

46:24.070 --> 46:25.539
Hi, mom.

46:25.540 --> 46:27.579
- What have you got?
- What happened to your lip?

46:27.580 --> 46:30.179
Oh, I, um, I bit it in my sleep.

46:30.180 --> 46:31.549
Listen, I'm just passing,
brought you...

46:31.550 --> 46:33.979
I'm very sorry, but mom,
look, I'd ask you in,

46:33.980 --> 46:35.519
but we're not...
we're going out.

46:35.520 --> 46:37.990
- Samantha.
- Hi, grandma.

46:46.200 --> 46:48.329
Have you got a guest here?

46:48.330 --> 46:49.999
Why would you ask that?

46:50.000 --> 46:52.099
There are four plates out.

46:52.100 --> 46:56.300
That's mine, um, i...
i had an extra serving.

46:57.410 --> 46:59.570
Yeah...

46:59.580 --> 47:01.579
well, I won't keep you.

47:01.580 --> 47:04.879
Look, thank you so much, mom.

47:04.880 --> 47:07.049
- Call me if you need anything.
- I will, absolutely.

47:07.050 --> 47:08.849
I'm sorry.

47:08.850 --> 47:10.590
- Bye.
- -Bye, grandma.

47:13.920 --> 47:15.090
Where is he?

47:36.140 --> 47:40.049
Hey!

47:40.050 --> 47:41.450
Hey, you!

47:42.420 --> 47:44.989
Matt?

47:44.990 --> 47:46.319
Matt, it is you.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.190
Hey, you're supposed to be dead.

47:50.260 --> 47:52.159
Insurance scam, right?

47:52.160 --> 47:56.160
Hey, wow, so, um,
how much did you get?

47:56.170 --> 47:59.099
Let me guess, um,
you got a million.

47:59.100 --> 48:00.400
You got a million, right?

48:04.310 --> 48:05.910
Where's he gone?

48:07.340 --> 48:09.040
I've no idea.

48:11.150 --> 48:13.010
Hey! Hey!

48:14.120 --> 48:15.680
Hey, I'll do you a favor.

48:19.690 --> 48:21.659
A favor?

48:21.660 --> 48:24.430
Yeah, favor, if you
do one for me.

48:27.330 --> 48:29.360
I'll keep your secret.

48:29.370 --> 48:32.270
All you have to do is break me
off a little slice.

48:40.340 --> 48:42.009
Hey, don't you
walk away from me!

48:42.010 --> 48:44.709
Matt! Matt!

48:44.710 --> 48:46.510
Let's talk about this.

49:02.030 --> 49:03.530
Matt.

49:04.470 --> 49:06.599
- Hey.
- Hey, that's it?

49:06.600 --> 49:09.600
Hey? You disappeared for half the
afternoon, and it's just "hey"?

49:09.610 --> 49:11.439
Where the hell have you been?

49:11.440 --> 49:13.039
I just wanted to look around.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.509
You can't just go
looking around.

49:14.510 --> 49:16.740
What if somebody sees you?
What are we gonna say?

49:16.750 --> 49:18.710
- How do we explain it?
- Okay.

49:24.450 --> 49:26.089
It's different here.

49:26.090 --> 49:28.120
I just kept walking.

49:31.560 --> 49:33.660
I won't leave you again.

49:36.570 --> 49:38.600
You just had me worried. I just...

49:41.170 --> 49:42.670
please don't do that again.

50:52.340 --> 50:54.380
You must be so happy.

50:55.380 --> 50:58.209
What?

50:58.210 --> 50:59.780
Your family.

51:02.680 --> 51:05.220
What were you doing
in Samantha's room?

51:13.700 --> 51:16.460
Seeing my daughter
lying there was...

51:17.700 --> 51:19.430
Extraordinary.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.400
She's beautiful.

51:22.410 --> 51:24.870
Yeah, she is.

51:35.550 --> 51:37.519
This is all really
new to me, Jane.

51:37.520 --> 51:39.220
I'm sorry if I upset you.

51:49.430 --> 51:51.769
Hey, stranger.

51:51.770 --> 51:53.300
Hi.

51:54.870 --> 51:58.640
So, what are we gonna
tell Dawkins?

52:01.240 --> 52:02.640
Nothing.

52:04.150 --> 52:07.649
But it's a huge breakthrough.

52:07.650 --> 52:09.349
And they're about
to cut our funding.

52:09.350 --> 52:10.649
We have to tell them something.

52:10.650 --> 52:12.490
We'll hold off another week.

52:16.530 --> 52:18.190
Okay.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.460
So, how's Matt?

52:26.170 --> 52:27.640
He's fine.

52:30.540 --> 52:32.170
That good, huh?

52:53.360 --> 52:55.359
Good afternoon.

52:55.360 --> 52:58.369
Did you drive past here
earlier today?

52:58.370 --> 53:00.530
Uh, yes, yes, I did.

53:00.540 --> 53:03.340
Did you see anything suspicious?

53:10.280 --> 53:11.949
According to witness reports,

53:11.950 --> 53:14.520
it appears the victim
suffered severe burns...

53:17.550 --> 53:20.650
- hey!
- Oh, hi.

53:23.390 --> 53:26.629
Uh, the police stopped me
on the way home.

53:26.630 --> 53:28.659
What?

53:28.660 --> 53:32.299
Someone's been murdered
at the park.

53:32.300 --> 53:33.900
Murder?

53:35.900 --> 53:38.309
You didn't notice anything, did you?

53:38.310 --> 53:40.470
No, I walked along the river.

53:42.540 --> 53:44.749
You okay?

53:44.750 --> 53:48.480
Yes, it's just in our
backyard, that's all.

54:05.300 --> 54:07.370
- Hey!
- Hey.

54:25.650 --> 54:27.389
Huh? What is that?

54:27.390 --> 54:28.919
- What is that?
- It's really nothing.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.959
- And even when i...
- what is this?

54:30.960 --> 54:33.029
...Why did you do that?

54:33.030 --> 54:34.659
I didn't...
this is my work for school.

54:34.660 --> 54:37.829
Just give it back to me.
You need to give it back.

54:37.830 --> 54:39.499
- Okay, that's stupid.
- What's going on?

54:39.500 --> 54:41.869
- It's stupid. Look.
- What?

54:41.870 --> 54:45.310
It's insulting.
Okay? That's what it is.

54:46.880 --> 54:49.679
...Oh, I'm so sorry.

54:49.680 --> 54:50.740
Oh, shh, sweetheart.

54:50.750 --> 54:52.379
It's all right.
He just needs...

54:52.380 --> 54:54.779
he just needs a little bit
more time to settle in.

54:54.780 --> 54:55.850
That's all he...

55:00.720 --> 55:01.890
mom, he's weird.

55:03.630 --> 55:05.089
Stupid.

55:05.090 --> 55:07.859
We just need a bit more time
to get used to him.

55:07.860 --> 55:09.660
- He doesn't have children.
- Mom.

55:09.670 --> 55:11.730
You don't even know him.

55:30.020 --> 55:31.549
Matt, will you open the door?

55:31.550 --> 55:32.920
We need to talk.

55:43.470 --> 55:44.870
Matt.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.599
Matt.

55:47.600 --> 55:49.069
Are you in there?
Can you...

55:49.070 --> 55:51.069
can you open the door, please?

55:51.070 --> 55:51.760
We need to talk.

55:51.772 --> 55:53.840
"Can you open the door, please?
We need to talk."

55:56.380 --> 55:57.369
Matt, can you open the door?
We need to talk.

55:57.381 --> 55:58.049
"Matt, can you open the door,

55:58.050 --> 55:59.380
we need to talk."

56:14.130 --> 56:16.929
- You really frightened the kids.
- I didn't mean to.

56:16.930 --> 56:21.739
I overreacted.
I'm so sorry.

56:21.740 --> 56:24.000
I don't know.
Maybe... maybe it's my fault.

56:24.010 --> 56:27.570
Maybe I'm just expecting
too much of you.

56:27.580 --> 56:30.609
Should I send the kids to
grandma's for a couple of days or...

56:30.610 --> 56:32.450
do you need time?

56:35.680 --> 56:37.789
I'm fine with that.

56:37.790 --> 56:41.620
Are you happy here,
you know, with me?

56:44.790 --> 56:47.559
Do you mean do I want
to go back?

56:47.560 --> 56:50.560
No, no, I didn't...
i didn't say... say that.

56:55.170 --> 56:57.809
Are you threatening me, Jane?

56:57.810 --> 57:00.139
No, no.
No, I'm not.

57:00.140 --> 57:03.040
I wouldn't do that.

57:03.050 --> 57:04.450
Okay.

57:05.980 --> 57:07.780
I don't wanna go back.

57:10.720 --> 57:13.190
Yeah, okay.

57:15.090 --> 57:16.589
Where are we going?

57:16.590 --> 57:18.590
We're gonna go to auntie Ruth's.

57:44.790 --> 57:46.719
Matt?

57:46.720 --> 57:48.890
I hope Samantha can forgive me.

57:50.660 --> 57:54.730
Well, uh, you know,
you scared them, so...

57:56.800 --> 57:58.529
where you headed?

57:58.530 --> 58:01.900
After I drop the kids off,
I'll be going to the lab.

58:03.840 --> 58:04.909
Will regg be there?

58:04.910 --> 58:07.980
Yeah, he's my assistant.

58:10.040 --> 58:11.879
He's more than that.

58:11.880 --> 58:13.679
What?

58:13.680 --> 58:15.280
Matt?

58:18.920 --> 58:21.619
I think you're right.

58:21.620 --> 58:24.120
I think it was a mistake
to bring him here.

58:26.690 --> 58:30.000
Okay, uh, what are you gonna do?

58:32.870 --> 58:34.839
I want to go back to his world.

58:34.840 --> 58:36.840
I wanna look into his life.

58:41.910 --> 58:45.209
He's not leaving, regg.

58:45.210 --> 58:48.320
He's made it very clear.
He is not going anywhere.

58:49.950 --> 58:52.190
I need to go back.

58:54.320 --> 58:55.920
I'll boot it up.

58:55.930 --> 58:57.590
Thank you.

58:59.230 --> 59:02.760
I've been doing a few
experiments at home,

59:02.770 --> 59:04.699
and I've been building
some more equipment,

59:04.700 --> 59:07.669
- and I think I've found...
- regg...

59:07.670 --> 59:10.870
- just later.
- Yeah, sure.

59:17.680 --> 59:19.080
You ready?

59:21.020 --> 59:22.350
Ready.

01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:45.870
Hello?

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:53.359
Matt, what are you doing here?

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.100
Where's Jane?

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.120
Can i... can i...
can I help you with something?

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.590
Oh, oh, please, just don't
touch any of the equipment,

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.960
it's, um, it's very sensitive.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.980
Can i... can I get you
a drink, or something?

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.480
Uh, and they're
touch screens, so...

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.089
please, don't touch.

01:03:52.090 --> 01:03:53.320
What are you doing? No!

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:16.609
Action parameter on.

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:19.050
The fox modulator is on.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.080
Okay.

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:30.920
Do you realize what you've done?

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.920
All right.

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:01.489
What's going on?
Why isn't it working?

01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:05.929
It should be working.
It should be working.

01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:08.060
Why isn't it working?

01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:13.270
- Where you heading?
- I'm going to the lab.

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:18.569
Oh, no, you bastard!

01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:22.180
Oh, god.

01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:52.110
Hey you, you're finally back.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.279
Did you miss me?

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.649
Regg? How... how...
how did you get here?

01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:02.720
Um, in my car, like normal.

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:07.619
I'm feeling much better,
thanks for asking.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.659
Hey, how come you haven't
been answering your phone?

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.620
I've called you, like, 20 times.

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:16.530
Did Matt confiscate
your phone again?

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:23.670
Why aren't you wearing
your uniform?

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:29.080
I like it.

01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:32.610
What? Regg!

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.419
Okay.

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.719
I almost... I almost got it
working last night.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.089
- What?
- I tried a few tests.

01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:45.229
I couldn't get the petawatts
to stabilize, but I'm so close.

01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:47.159
Wait! What?

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.359
You have one of these
machines at your house?

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.329
Yeah, like we discussed.

01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:53.499
You gotta take me there.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.070
My place?

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.570
Sorry about the mess inside.
It's been a crazy week.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.310
Tell me about it.

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:16.520
So, this is what you wanted
to talk to me about.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:25.829
- You've been busy.
- It's all here.

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:28.640
Just a few teething
problems though.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.079
What are you doing?

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.319
Do you have a screwdriver?

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.680
Why?

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:48.290
Cause I know how
to make it work.

01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:56.460
Right, that's...
should do it.

01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:59.870
This is exciting.

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:03.140
Yeah.

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:05.469
What? We're testing now?

01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:06.840
Yeah.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.810
Are you crazy?

01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:13.549
Possibly.

01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:18.349
I need you to push the slider
to 350 petawatts.

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:20.490
Whoa! We could blow
the entire grid!

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.828
You've heard of tegmark's
theory of parallel worlds?

01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:29.158
- Yeah.
- I've proven it.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.460
What?
You've done this before?

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:32.198
Yes.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.800
Well, I'm coming with you.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.180
350 petawatts.

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:46.368
It's a parallel world.

01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:48.270
Yeah.

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:50.709
Oh, it feels like
a really bad hangover.

01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:53.279
Yeah.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:07.459
Oh, this is amazing.

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:12.630
Trust me, you'll get used to it.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.780
- We need a car, regg.
- Where are we going?

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.750
I've gotta get to my place.

01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:38.989
Come on.

01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:40.490
What are you doing?

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.529
Seizing my initiative.

01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:45.270
What?

01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:55.410
Oh, my god.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.429
- I need you to stay here.
- Sure.

01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:15.660
- What's that for?
- It's just a precaution.

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:38.080
When you're looking
at petawatts, at petawattage,

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:42.359
you've gotta be really clear about how
much power... the logistics of it...

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.389
you just stick
to writing your books, honey.

01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:46.429
- Okay? I'm done with you.
- -I'm very sorry.

01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:48.459
We're very, very close.

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:51.429
We've mixed up in a couple of
verbals, it's not quite there yet,

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:53.430
but we are so close,
i just know it,

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.699
I can feel it in my bones.

01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:56.940
Regg is nearly there.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:04.479
- What happened?
- We're in the wrong world.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.409
What?

01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:07.710
Go!

01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:26.130
You changed the parameters?

01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:29.740
Yeah, yeah, i...

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.110
well, I think we're good to go.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.780
This is kind of exhilarating.

01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:42.120
Listen, regg...

01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:50.859
There's something i...
i have to tell you.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:54.630
Your Jane is dead.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.660
My Jane?

01:12:58.670 --> 01:12:59.899
What?

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:03.170
I'm from a different
world to yours.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.449
What do you mean dead?

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:15.519
How?

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.080
I think it was Matt.

01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:19.889
I think he's killed her.

01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:22.159
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:24.920
Police, open up!

01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:27.660
He's got my kids.
I have to get home.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.999
- Regg, I have to go, i...
- just go. Go now!

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.199
- I'll wait for you.
- No, I'm staying here.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.100
- What? Here?
- Just go!

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.710
What the hell is this?

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.460
Surprise.

01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:11.669
Yes?

01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:12.909
Hello.

01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:14.209
Who is this?

01:14:14.210 --> 01:14:16.079
Jane asked me to call you.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.109
- I'm her new assistant.
- What happened to regg?

01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:20.779
You won't be seeing him again.

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.679
What do you want exactly?

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:25.019
She wants me
to pick up the kids.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:26.189
Are they with you?

01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:28.219
No, probably at Ruth's.

01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:30.789
Do you want the number?

01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:33.130
Actually, i need the address.

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.980
Oh, god.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.969
Oh, regg.

01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:18.300
Oh, god.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:57.910
Ruth!

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.700
Anybody home?
Jake, Ruth?

01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:24.869
Ruth?

01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:26.870
Samantha?

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.279
- This is Ruth.
- Oh, god, Ruth!

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.349
- Jane?
- Thank god.

01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:42.959
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, listen are the kids with you?

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.020
Yes, we're heading
to your home now.

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:47.630
Jane?

01:16:48.930 --> 01:16:52.329
Listen, I've gotta go.

01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:54.730
Just wait for me there, okay?

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:55.939
You okay?

01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:57.739
Just wait for me there.

01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:59.240
Jane!

01:17:19.930 --> 01:17:21.890
Ruth?

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.180
Samantha?

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:26.389
Jane!
Samantha!

01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:27.729
Open the door!

01:18:27.730 --> 01:18:29.159
- Mom?
- -Oh, god.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.360
Mom, are you okay?
What's going on?

01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:34.999
I thought I'd lost
you, too. Oh, Samantha.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.070
Jane, what's going on?

01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:45.209
Lock the door.
He's gone crazy.

01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:46.949
- We have to hide.
- What? From who?

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:48.249
I don't have time to explain.

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:50.380
You have to trust me.
We have to hide.

01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:10.460
Anyone there?

01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:36.459
How the hell did you get back?

01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:40.059
I saw what you did to her.

01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:42.229
She was the one
having the affair.

01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:45.900
That's no justification.

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:51.340
It was to me.

01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:07.250
Oh!

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:09.960
Oh!

01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:13.430
Holy shit.

01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:20.070
What do we do now?

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.440
I'm coming back for you, bitch.

01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:35.110
Where's he going, mom?

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.980
A long, long way away from us.

01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:33.040
Ah.

01:23:25.190 --> 01:23:27.559
Ooh! We better get going.
We'll be late.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.259
Yeah.

01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:31.160
Have a great day, guys.

01:23:31.170 --> 01:23:33.329
- Be good.
- Always, mom.

01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:35.600
- Bye.
- Yeah, right.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.340
And, bye.

01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:42.739
Are we meeting later for coffee?

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:44.179
Sounds great.

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:45.810
- At the lab?
- Yes.

01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:24.080
Something terrible's happened.

01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:29.660
You're in the wrong world.
