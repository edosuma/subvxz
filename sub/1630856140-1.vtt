WEBVTT

02:11.208 --> 02:14.833
It's always better on the piano,
I don't know why.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
So to...

02:23.333 --> 02:26.750
answer your question, yes,
I carry her around with me quite a bit.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.416
I've often seen her in the garden working.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.749
Julia Vega swears that she's at
the top of the stairs every morning

02:36.833 --> 02:38.749
when she comes down to do the laundry,

02:38.833 --> 02:41.500
making sure she's separating
the whites and the darks.

02:42.583 --> 02:45.791
And our children are very jealous
because they've never seen her.

02:49.833 --> 02:50.833
I... I...

02:53.708 --> 02:55.333
I miss her terribly.

03:13.333 --> 03:14.333
Hello?

03:16.625 --> 03:17.625
Yes.

03:20.708 --> 03:21.708
Of course.

03:24.250 --> 03:25.458
Yes, I'm aware.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.250
Oh.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.957
Can you hold on one second, please?

03:43.750 --> 03:45.958
That's terrible news. Is he gonna be okay?

03:48.166 --> 03:49.250
No, I understand.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.041
And no chance for a rehearsal?

03:55.583 --> 03:56.583
Yes.

03:58.500 --> 03:59.500
All right.

04:03.041 --> 04:05.250
May I get three tickets for today?

04:06.375 --> 04:07.375
Yes.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.583
All right.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.000
All right, yes, thank you.

04:37.458 --> 04:39.875
You got 'em, boy!

05:21.250 --> 05:22.499
- Leonard, <i>bellissimo.</i>
- Oh, yes.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.582
Did you get any sleep?

05:23.666 --> 05:26.499
No, I didn't get any sleep, Bruno.
"Manfred" starts on the downbeat rest,

05:26.583 --> 05:28.624
and you didn't get me any rehearsal
with the orchestra.

05:28.708 --> 05:30.124
I told you you were going on.

05:30.208 --> 05:32.249
No, you told me it was a possibility.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.666
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

05:33.750 --> 05:36.957
<i>United States Rubber Company
again invites you to Carnegie Hall,</i>

05:37.041 --> 05:40.249
<i>to hear a concert of the New York
Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra</i>

05:40.333 --> 05:43.249
<i>of which Artur Rodziński is
musical director.</i>

05:43.333 --> 05:46.957
<i>Bruno Walter, who was to have conducted
this afternoon, is ill,</i>

05:47.041 --> 05:50.707
<i>and his place will be taken by the young
American-born assistant conductor</i>

05:50.791 --> 05:53.333
<i>of the Philharmonic Symphony,
Leonard Bernstein.</i>

06:30.083 --> 06:34.166
Today, you were here
for an historic performance.

06:34.250 --> 06:39.249
This performance that was fantastic
was broadcast all over the world.

06:39.333 --> 06:44.249
And I feel obliged to say
that Maestro Bernstein

06:44.333 --> 06:46.666
was called this morning at 9:30

06:46.750 --> 06:49.791
and he was told that
he would actually conduct here

06:49.875 --> 06:52.749
- for the first time after many years--
- Without rehearsal.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.457
Without rehearsal.

06:54.541 --> 06:56.999
But he loves the music,
he doesn't need rehearsal,

06:57.083 --> 06:58.499
he feels it so much.

06:58.583 --> 07:01.207
And after many years,
he really wanted this,

07:01.291 --> 07:03.749
it has happened and I'm so proud.

07:03.833 --> 07:07.249
Carnegie Hall is so proud of you
and New York is proud of you.

07:07.333 --> 07:08.749
Leonard Bernstein.

07:08.833 --> 07:13.041
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

07:17.125 --> 07:20.416
I'll tell you fellas, I don't remember
a thing after that downbeat rest.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.707
I must've blacked out and then
when the audience applauded I came to.

07:23.791 --> 07:26.499
Don't let this get in the way.
We're on a roll here, baby.

07:26.583 --> 07:29.707
I wanna choreograph the segment
with the dancers while in Cincinnati.

07:29.791 --> 07:32.041
Jerry, I'm in love with the music.
I told you.

07:32.125 --> 07:34.791
As soon as I have something,
I'll record and send it to you.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.666
This the new ballet he's composing?

07:36.750 --> 07:39.874
About three sailors on leave in New York
getting up to no good?

07:39.958 --> 07:41.874
- That's the one.
- Don't argue with him.

07:41.958 --> 07:44.874
He's a young man to be reckoned with.
You can read it here.

07:44.958 --> 07:47.166
- David, please.
- "Bernstein shows mastery of score."

07:47.250 --> 07:49.707
"Youthful conductor carries out
an exacting program--"

07:49.791 --> 07:52.582
Sure, right next to Hitler's bombing
of Poland.

07:52.666 --> 07:54.291
Come on in, it's open.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.457
- Sorry, gentlemen--
- No, no, he likes leaving the door open.

07:58.541 --> 08:01.624
Hey, Isaac, you know David
and that's Jerry Robbins.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.791
- Hi.
- Hello. We've got to get downstairs.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.874
- You're an hour late--
- I'm just working on the score--

08:05.958 --> 08:08.207
- Rodziński's coming early--
- Rodziński's here?

08:08.291 --> 08:10.291
- Okay, I'll be down in a second.
- Isaac.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.707
Don't forget your show pony here
is a composer.

08:45.833 --> 08:48.041
I'm learning not to do it so hard, right?

08:48.125 --> 08:50.249
- It's perfect.
- I always get so...

08:50.333 --> 08:51.750
overzealous.

08:52.791 --> 08:54.707
- I get too excited.
- Right.

08:54.791 --> 08:57.291
Both your feet in my lap.
I don't know what to do with it.

08:57.375 --> 09:00.125
I don't know what to do with myself.
It's just too much.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.624
- I think--
- It's too much for one man.

09:03.708 --> 09:05.749
- Because it was on the liver spot?
- No.

09:05.833 --> 09:08.333
It's too much for one man to take.
Honestly, David.

09:10.708 --> 09:12.707
I mean, I'll never leave the apartment.

09:12.791 --> 09:14.500
- That's the reality.
- Please don't.

09:19.750 --> 09:20.874
Dear Jerry,

09:20.958 --> 09:23.082
this is an impromptu apology
for the record

09:23.166 --> 09:26.249
which isn't so very bad,
but it's not so very good either.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.791
I'm looking through the score now,
exhausted,

09:28.875 --> 09:31.332
and everything's okay up to number three

09:31.416 --> 09:34.416
when all the counterpoint comes in
with the two pianos.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.333
I'm afraid it's sort of messy there.

09:37.166 --> 09:39.082
Anyway, it's hard to do on two pianos,

09:39.166 --> 09:41.707
so with an orchestra,
I think it'll be very clear.

09:41.791 --> 09:43.208
And pardon all the mistakes.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.957
But it was all Aaron Copland's fault.

09:47.041 --> 09:49.666
- It was all my fault.
- And there he sits now.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.750
- That's not true.
- Anyway...

09:54.250 --> 09:56.666
I'll leave it to you to figure out,
Mr. Robbins,

09:56.750 --> 09:58.749
how to dance to this type of music, but,

09:58.833 --> 10:02.249
give my love to everybody
and the thing, and, uh...

10:02.333 --> 10:04.333
I hope you like it. Good luck, Jerry.

10:05.291 --> 10:07.249
All right, got to get to rehearsal.

10:07.333 --> 10:08.874
- I got it.
- You do?

10:08.958 --> 10:10.374
- Yeah.
- You're such a chap.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.874
It's downstairs and
you're still going to be late.

10:12.958 --> 10:14.791
Put in a word for me with Rodziński.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.957
I will. I'm not his favorite, but I will.

10:17.041 --> 10:18.666
- Love you, baby.
- Love you.

Brilliant, but... but what no one here knows

is how he beat the soprano
out of his poor baby sister

12:03.416 --> 12:05.874
performing all those operas
when we were children.

12:05.958 --> 12:09.166
Let that be fair warning to you
and to everyone.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.082
Hello.

12:11.166 --> 12:14.457
Thought you might be here.
You've certainly been making the rounds.

12:14.541 --> 12:15.957
Have you met the gang?

12:16.041 --> 12:18.124
- No.
- Betty and Adolf, they're a riot.

12:18.208 --> 12:19.041
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:19.125 --> 12:22.541
Ellen. Of course, you've run into her
at another studio, no doubt.

12:22.625 --> 12:23.583
Hello, Felicia.

12:24.208 --> 12:26.541
Who did I miss? Have I missed anyone?

12:26.625 --> 12:28.041
Just the piano player.

12:28.125 --> 12:30.957
Well, I figured
you needed no introduction.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.791
- Hello. I'm Lenny.
- Hello. Felicia.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.832
Bernstein, like that one.

12:35.916 --> 12:36.791
Montealegre.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.707
Montealegre?

12:38.791 --> 12:41.416
- Montealegre Cohn.
- Cohn?

12:41.500 --> 12:42.708
Montealegre Cohn.

12:43.666 --> 12:45.832
Well, that's an interesting
marriage of words.

12:49.208 --> 12:51.124

12:58.958 --> 13:02.291
You come from an aristocratic
European family on your mother's side,

13:02.375 --> 13:04.832
and your father is American
and he's Jewish

13:04.916 --> 13:06.541
and you moved to Chile because--

13:06.625 --> 13:08.791
- It's amazing, I remember all this.
- I know.

13:08.875 --> 13:09.957
I don't know how.

13:10.041 --> 13:12.666
You moved to Chile
because of your father's business.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.958
And now you're firmly planted
in New York City studying...

13:16.750 --> 13:19.082
piano, but you're
actually studying acting.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.666
A career which demands the versatility
to play a panoply of characters.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.375
And that is my conclusion,

13:25.125 --> 13:27.374
that you, my dear, are very similar to me.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.457
- How?
- Because you had to take

13:29.541 --> 13:33.707
all the pieces, all the bits of you
scattered across these varied landscapes

13:33.791 --> 13:36.749
and form, create the veritable person
that stands before me now.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.041
How is that similar?

13:38.125 --> 13:40.541
- You just asked me and I told you.
- I know. Okay.

13:40.625 --> 13:42.041
Russian Orthodox Jew.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.457
- Growing up in Boston.
- Oh, someone else was listening.

13:44.541 --> 13:45.874
- Child of immigrants.
- Yes.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.874
Your father's a self-made businessman.

13:47.958 --> 13:49.999
Steeped in Talmud.
Harvard.

13:50.083 --> 13:51.916
- Then Curtis School for Music--
- Institute.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.749
Institute of Music in Philadelphia.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.874
Now firmly planted here in New York City
pursuing composition and conducting.

13:57.958 --> 14:01.499
Under the guise of a concert pianist
drawn to this artistic Mecca,

14:01.583 --> 14:03.874
fleeing my puritanical origins
just like you.

14:03.958 --> 14:06.332
Surely your family was
a tad more supportive.

14:06.416 --> 14:10.082
My father imagined me a klezmer,
playing for kopecks on the street corner,

14:10.166 --> 14:12.916
desperate for me to join
the family business to make a living.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.458
What was the family business?

14:15.458 --> 14:17.874
Samuel J. Bernstein Hair Company.

14:17.958 --> 14:18.832
- Really?
- Yes.

14:18.916 --> 14:21.249
So I had no choice
but to become a composite of

14:21.333 --> 14:23.457
adopted speech,
manner and outlook on life,

14:23.541 --> 14:26.499
a composite, which enables me to be
many things at once.

14:26.583 --> 14:30.582
And that's why, we, you and I,
are able to endure and survive

14:30.666 --> 14:34.582
'cause the world wants us to be
only one thing and I find that deplorable.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.499
I find you very attractive, Felicia.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.791
<i>♪ Carried away, carried away ♪</i>

14:39.875 --> 14:41.082
<i>♪ You got carried away ♪</i>

14:41.166 --> 14:43.375
It's really too much. I'm very sorry.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.249
Wait! Wait!

14:46.416 --> 14:47.958
Go! Go! Go!

14:58.291 --> 15:00.249
Oh, I like that.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.041
You've a lot of energy, have to tell you.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.291
I'm just following you.
I don't know where.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.916
I've never been in this part of town.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.374
I can't imagine you
being in a place like this.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.332
- Now, you go in here.
- Okay.

15:11.416 --> 15:14.124
- Just on the stage-- Take your shoes off.
- Oh.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.707
Okay. Where do I put them?

15:15.791 --> 15:17.208
Over on the other side.

15:21.958 --> 15:25.041
- Where are you going?
- I'm just getting the script.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.957
- The script?
- Yes.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.332
- Would I have to act too?
- What?

15:30.416 --> 15:33.625
- Do I have to do something?
- Well... maybe.

15:35.583 --> 15:36.666
Now I'm nervous.

15:37.750 --> 15:39.166
You should be nervous.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.750
Well, this is just lovely.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.875
This is just lovely.

15:52.875 --> 15:55.291
I'm going to read a scene
with Maestro Bernstein.

15:55.375 --> 15:57.041
I better make a show of myself.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.457
Maestro Bernstein?
That sounds very fancy.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.332
- Here.
- Okay. We're gonna read it.

16:01.416 --> 16:03.082
- We're actually gonna do it.
- Yes.

16:03.166 --> 16:05.416
- I'm the king?
- You're the king, and this is your castle.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.541
Oh, wonderful.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.958
Now, even though you are the king,

16:09.583 --> 16:11.916
- you're quite taken with me.
- Yes.

16:12.750 --> 16:16.166
So, you decided to give me a white rose
from your crown.

16:16.250 --> 16:17.250
Of course I did.

16:17.958 --> 16:20.541
No, you don't have it yet.
I have to give it to you.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.749
- Here's your flower.
- I didn't read the play.

16:22.833 --> 16:23.707
- I know.
- Hold on.

16:23.791 --> 16:25.958
Can you hold this for me, please?
All right.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.666
Since I'm the king...

16:31.791 --> 16:33.000
who's in love.

16:37.416 --> 16:39.750
A gift for me, my liege?

16:41.083 --> 16:42.375
Oh, that's very good.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.625
- It's your line.
- Oh, uh...

16:46.750 --> 16:49.582
"With your little spots of wax,
white rose,

16:49.666 --> 16:52.291
you look like the extravagantly hands
her the flower--"

16:52.375 --> 16:53.958
No, no, no.

16:54.583 --> 16:56.791
"You look like the eye...

16:58.583 --> 17:00.499
of a broken moon."

17:00.583 --> 17:02.000
You are terrible.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.291
What's your line?

17:06.625 --> 17:08.458
"You're always changing, my love."

17:11.083 --> 17:12.916
"I didn't see you yesterday."

17:14.208 --> 17:15.833
"But I looked at your horse."

17:17.125 --> 17:18.541
"It's so beautiful."

17:20.333 --> 17:22.166
"But not as beautiful as you are...

17:23.583 --> 17:25.416
because you are a dragon."

17:40.375 --> 17:43.375
"I believe you could
break me in two with your arms,

17:44.791 --> 17:46.208
as weak as I am...

17:47.750 --> 17:48.958
like frost

17:49.875 --> 17:51.500
burned in the sun."

17:54.208 --> 17:56.624
That's a bit better,
isn't it, Ms. Montealegre?

17:56.708 --> 17:58.332
Little more light?

17:58.416 --> 18:01.416
- Why, thank you, Joseph.
- Oh, Joseph, I apologize.

18:02.208 --> 18:06.208
I got nervous. I thought it was a spider
and I tried to kill it with my jacket.

18:07.208 --> 18:10.416
Give the stage door a shove
on your way out. It'll lock on its own.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.624
Thank you, Joseph.

18:11.708 --> 18:13.833
Good night. Marvelous.
Thank you, Joseph.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.332
You didn't tell me
your father owns this place.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.625
Is this how you lure in
all your male suitors?

18:24.583 --> 18:27.666
No, I... I rarely stay up past 9:00.

18:27.750 --> 18:30.083
Hold on a sec.
You made an exception for me?

18:33.166 --> 18:35.874
I thought maybe you were worth
making an exception for.

18:35.958 --> 18:38.791
Oh, well,
I hope it doesn't cost you too much.

18:39.541 --> 18:42.083
How can I make it worth your while?
Oh, I've got it.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.375
- Something's wrong.
- What?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.166
- What's your character's name?
- Um...

18:49.041 --> 18:50.666
- Margaret.
- Margaret.

18:51.916 --> 18:53.125
- Margaret.
- Yes.

18:53.791 --> 18:55.416
- And you're the understudy?
- Yes.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.082
I think you should be Margaret
eight shows a week.

18:58.166 --> 18:59.166
Front and center.

18:59.250 --> 19:02.541
- If it's fear that's stopping you--
- There are many things stopping me

19:02.625 --> 19:04.041
but fear isn't one of them.

19:04.875 --> 19:07.124
I wouldn't be standing here
in front of you...

19:07.208 --> 19:10.916
I wouldn't even be in New York City
if fear got the better of me.

19:12.125 --> 19:14.082
It's just not that easy.

19:14.166 --> 19:15.749
We'd be fools not to think that

19:15.833 --> 19:18.499
luck plays a part
as well as talent and determination.

19:18.583 --> 19:21.499
- I'm a perfect example of that.
- Oh, you must be joking.

19:21.583 --> 19:24.124
If Bruno Walter hadn't
gotten sick that fateful day

19:24.208 --> 19:27.332
and Rodziński snowed in upstate,
I never would've had my debut.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.791
I'd be teaching piano
to little eight-year-olds who complain--

19:30.875 --> 19:33.249
If it wasn't that day,
it would've been another.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.500
- Is that what you think?
- Yes, I know it.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.041
- Really?
- Of course.

19:38.875 --> 19:42.291
And don't forget... you are a man.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.083
I never do.

19:46.958 --> 19:47.958
Right.

19:50.958 --> 19:52.374
Oh, my God.

20:32.166 --> 20:33.000
Bravo!

20:38.500 --> 20:40.125
You were marvelous.

20:41.250 --> 20:44.874
Oh, my goodness.
Shirley, it was very kind of you to come.

20:44.958 --> 20:47.582
- I brought Richard Hart and his wife, Lil.
- No.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.791
Dick is rehearsing
his new Broadway show with Eva Gabor

20:50.875 --> 20:55.416
and he is not long for this marriage
and, well, I think he is your type.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.166
- What type is that?
- Same as mine,

20:58.250 --> 20:59.666
unavailable.

21:01.666 --> 21:02.666
Marvelous.

21:03.625 --> 21:04.708
Ah, ah...

21:05.750 --> 21:07.374
It's so kind of you to come.

21:07.458 --> 21:09.457
I just love <i>Dark of the Moon.</i>

21:09.541 --> 21:11.916
Oh, stop. You're marvelous.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.207
The production is better
for you being in it.

21:14.291 --> 21:16.957
It's only for the week,
but that's kind of you to say.

21:17.041 --> 21:20.041
If they had any sense,
they'll tell Ms. Jones to stay in bed.

21:20.125 --> 21:21.541
You really are wonderful.

21:22.208 --> 21:24.541
- Dear.
- Thank you, it's so kind of you to come.

21:24.625 --> 21:25.832
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

21:25.916 --> 21:29.332
- Come have a bite with us.
- Oh, I, uh...

21:29.416 --> 21:32.416
I can't, I'm catching the train
to Tanglewood in the morning.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.583
- Tanglewood?
- Mmm.

21:34.375 --> 21:35.957
You're going to see my brother.

21:36.041 --> 21:39.541
- Well, don't look so surprised.
- I'm not... I just...

21:40.416 --> 21:41.833
He didn't mention it.

21:43.250 --> 21:44.083
Well...

21:45.041 --> 21:47.791
- Perhaps he was being discreet?
- My brother?

21:49.041 --> 21:50.125
I doubt it.

21:56.875 --> 21:58.874
- No, try again.
- Oh, gee, it's six.

21:58.958 --> 22:00.166
- No!
- Eight.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.541
- Terrible.
- It's four...

22:01.625 --> 22:02.624
- No.
- Three.

22:02.708 --> 22:04.582
Well, it has to be seven then.

22:04.666 --> 22:06.291
Can you try to just concentrate?

22:06.375 --> 22:08.457
Maybe I should stop
and think for a second.

22:08.541 --> 22:11.291
You just stop and think
'cause I am sending it to you

22:12.125 --> 22:12.958
right now.

22:13.625 --> 22:14.832
- Twenty.
- No.

22:17.375 --> 22:18.375
No.

22:19.541 --> 22:21.874
So, how long do we have to do this for?

22:21.958 --> 22:24.791
Well, we need to build up
a very strong connection.

22:24.875 --> 22:27.374
- I can't. I don't know what you're doing.
- Hmm?

22:27.458 --> 22:30.541
You could be building
a bomb back there for all I know.

22:30.666 --> 22:31.500
No.

22:32.958 --> 22:36.249
- I'm just very terribly relaxed.
- Blow the whole place up.

22:36.333 --> 22:37.333
Aren't you?

22:39.083 --> 22:40.707
- Yes, I am.
- Are you?

22:40.791 --> 22:41.624
Yes.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.208
I've never seen you sit still for so long.

22:47.666 --> 22:50.083
- Are you itching to move?
- No, I'm not.

22:50.708 --> 22:53.333
- Good.
- Actually, at all.

23:01.833 --> 23:03.125
Come here, I'll do it.

23:03.791 --> 23:04.875
My goodness.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.124
- I'm useless, aren't I?
- You are.

23:07.208 --> 23:08.082
Where am I going?

23:08.166 --> 23:10.582
- Here, stand there. Not this one.
- Okay.

23:10.666 --> 23:11.874
- Not.
- Oh, why not?

23:11.958 --> 23:14.708
Well... a bit garish maybe?

23:16.458 --> 23:18.791
Doesn't look bumbling so much.

23:18.875 --> 23:19.875
I like this.

23:28.416 --> 23:29.832
I love your smell.

23:29.916 --> 23:31.125
- You do?
- I do.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.916
It's my father.

23:38.916 --> 23:40.125
Isn't that odd?

23:42.250 --> 23:43.666
I used to just love...

23:45.041 --> 23:46.458
wrapping myself up

23:47.250 --> 23:48.874
in his trench coat,

23:48.958 --> 23:51.500
when he would walk in the door
at night from work...

23:54.000 --> 23:55.833
That smell would intoxicate me.

24:00.291 --> 24:04.125
I always associated it with feeling safe.

24:06.958 --> 24:08.957
She's so beautiful.
Tell me about her.

24:09.041 --> 24:11.291
- She's wonderful. She's a lovely girl.
- Yes.

24:11.375 --> 24:13.291
- And we're just--
- Where did you meet?

24:13.375 --> 24:15.916
- We met at a party at Claudio Arrau's.
- Ah.

24:16.666 --> 24:18.624
So, Felicia, are you an actress?

24:18.708 --> 24:20.541
- Marvelous actress, yes.
- No, I am.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.374
- Of course you are.
- No, I am.

24:22.458 --> 24:23.750
Unbelievably, I am.

24:24.583 --> 24:26.499
- He is not.
- No, horrible.

24:26.583 --> 24:28.416
- No, I am.
- Screen tested once in LA

24:28.500 --> 24:30.374
- and it was horrible.
- Terrible actor.

24:30.458 --> 24:32.707
They sent me to Hollywood
and put me on camera

24:32.791 --> 24:36.208
and said, "Thank you, here's a one-way
ticket back to New York City."

24:37.291 --> 24:39.707
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no" is right.

24:39.791 --> 24:43.416
He was a student here
at our inaugural summer and now...

24:44.666 --> 24:46.291
he's everyone's favorite teacher

24:46.375 --> 24:50.541
and you can't even get into the shed
when he's conducting the student orchestra

24:50.625 --> 24:52.249
because it's so full.

24:52.333 --> 24:55.291
- It's only because I love them so much.
- And they love you.

24:55.375 --> 24:58.874
Tell me what happened
with the Rochester Philharmonic.

24:58.958 --> 25:02.166
- Oh, they passed me over.
- Yes, I know.

25:03.875 --> 25:06.875
They thought I was spending
too much time with you in Boston.

25:07.833 --> 25:09.999
- Is that the reason?
- I believe it was.

25:10.083 --> 25:12.832
We should really discuss
"Our Town" if you have...

25:12.916 --> 25:14.583
Running off to Hollywood?

25:16.125 --> 25:18.332
- Wasting time on musical theater...
- I promise,

25:18.416 --> 25:19.957
I'm giving up musical theater.

25:20.041 --> 25:24.041
Lenny, you are responsible
on account of your gifts.

25:25.041 --> 25:29.916
He can be
the first great American conductor.

25:31.916 --> 25:37.124
But he would have to conduct his life

25:37.208 --> 25:42.041
in such a way that when he comes out
on stage to lead his orchestra,

25:42.125 --> 25:48.332
he can truthfully say to himself,
"My life and my work are clean."

25:50.708 --> 25:51.833
And the name...

25:52.916 --> 25:57.166
To a Bernstein,
they will never give an orchestra.

25:57.250 --> 26:00.041
But a Burns?

26:02.416 --> 26:05.958
Leonard S. Burns.

26:09.166 --> 26:12.166
- I'd have to sleep on that.
- I used to entertain people

26:12.250 --> 26:15.333
on the train
going back and forth to Moscow.

26:16.125 --> 26:19.749
And upon every arrival,
I had to return straightaway

26:19.833 --> 26:23.666
because, of course,
as Jews, we weren't allowed to live there.

26:25.291 --> 26:26.708
I never saw the city.

26:27.833 --> 26:28.833
Not once.

26:29.708 --> 26:32.125
But I got to play.

26:36.625 --> 26:38.166
I want to see them.

26:39.166 --> 26:40.166
See what?

26:40.250 --> 26:43.083
All the things
Maestro Koussevitsky wants you to give up.

26:43.625 --> 26:45.208
All the music you've made.

26:46.250 --> 26:48.458
- You do? We can't just leave.
- Yes.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.874
Oh, yes, we can.

27:20.625 --> 27:21.625
Unbelievable.

27:39.375 --> 27:41.374
Why would you ever want to give this up?

27:41.458 --> 27:43.957
- It's so wonderful.
- It's not serious music, is it?

27:44.041 --> 27:45.625
Well, what does that mean?

27:46.375 --> 27:47.375
Well, it means...

27:48.166 --> 27:50.916
he thinks I could be
the first great American conductor.

27:51.583 --> 27:52.708
Is that what you want?

27:54.708 --> 27:55.916
I want a lot of things.

29:59.916 --> 30:04.124
<i>♪ New York, New York! ♪</i>

30:04.208 --> 30:07.041
<i>♪ It's a hell of a town! ♪</i>

30:11.666 --> 30:13.000
How do you feel?

30:15.166 --> 30:16.791
I think it's better.

30:16.875 --> 30:19.625
Is it okay if I put my head like this?

30:20.875 --> 30:23.000
- It's terribly embarrassing.
- No.

30:24.625 --> 30:26.249
- No.
- It's as if I don't--

30:26.333 --> 30:28.249
If I just don't breathe, I'll be fine.

30:28.333 --> 30:29.750
Just... No.

30:31.458 --> 30:33.875
- It happens every time.
- Every time what?

30:35.708 --> 30:38.249
- What do you mean?
- Every time I go to bed

30:38.333 --> 30:40.332
- that I'm not used to.
- Oh, I see.

30:40.416 --> 30:43.416
- Well, you implied.
- Well, I don't know what you meant.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.832
- I was just...
- Oh, goodness.

30:45.916 --> 30:48.791
- It's the lower spine...
- Do you take any pills or anything?

30:48.875 --> 30:51.332
- I take plenty of pills.
- No, I mean, sure you do,

30:51.416 --> 30:53.166
but, I mean, specifically for this.

30:55.500 --> 30:58.458
- Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
- Hmm.

30:59.083 --> 31:00.375
You poor thing.

31:03.208 --> 31:05.499
- That's much better, being on the floor.
- Yes.

31:05.583 --> 31:07.791
Much better. Thank you. It's a great idea.

31:08.791 --> 31:10.707
You set it all up with the pillows.

31:10.791 --> 31:14.083
- You really do take care of me.
- I wanted to make you comfortable.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.916
I have a game we can play.
Envy and Secrets.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.624
- You know that game?
- No.

31:19.708 --> 31:22.791
We both tell each other a secret,
then we tell each other something

31:22.875 --> 31:25.291
that we're envious of
and then we become closer.

31:25.375 --> 31:26.999
But I feel pretty close already.

31:27.083 --> 31:29.541
You certainly seem closer
than 20 minutes ago.

31:30.416 --> 31:32.457
- Okay.
- I saw different sides of you

31:32.541 --> 31:35.750
- that I've only sort of dreamt about.
- Oh, goodness.

31:36.875 --> 31:37.708
Okay.

31:38.500 --> 31:39.582
You go first.

31:39.666 --> 31:41.832
Do you wanna say
something you're envious of

31:41.916 --> 31:43.416
or something that's a secret?

31:44.500 --> 31:45.416
Tell me a secret.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.457
- Oh, I'm gonna tell you a secret?
- Yes.

31:47.541 --> 31:49.541
- Did I just ash on you...
- No.

31:50.833 --> 31:51.833
Okay.

31:53.458 --> 31:55.208
Well, when I was a boy...

31:56.416 --> 31:57.541
Mmm.

31:59.833 --> 32:02.416
...I used to have dreams
where I would kill my father.

32:06.333 --> 32:10.208
And the thing of it is, I would wake up
from the dream and I'd sit in bed...

32:13.000 --> 32:14.833
and I would just fantasize about it...

32:17.625 --> 32:19.041
'cause he was so cruel.

32:35.250 --> 32:36.458
Sometimes I just can't...

32:37.291 --> 32:39.708
Can't seem to find myself.

32:47.333 --> 32:48.333
Well...

32:53.708 --> 32:55.708
I agree, by the way.

32:56.416 --> 32:58.625
- About what?
- About the name.

33:01.875 --> 33:03.500
Felicia Burns.

33:04.375 --> 33:06.583
It has absolutely no luster.

33:09.458 --> 33:11.666
I mean, it just sounds wrong.

33:14.250 --> 33:17.458
- Well, your sound soothes me... God.
- Does it?

33:19.333 --> 33:22.457
I actually envy the air
that gets to funnel its way through you.

33:22.541 --> 33:24.041
Out of my mouth, I hope.

33:24.125 --> 33:26.582
- Well, any which way, actually.
- No.

33:26.666 --> 33:28.874
I never thought of it like that.

33:28.958 --> 33:30.999
But it would definitely be some

33:31.083 --> 33:34.291
tonal pitch variations
if it came out the other end, wouldn't it?

33:35.958 --> 33:37.374
Just as pleasing, I assume.

33:37.458 --> 33:40.208
- Am I shaking?
- You're disgusting. Yes.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.416
Those eyes...

33:53.791 --> 33:56.416
You don't even know
how much you need me, do you?

34:01.791 --> 34:03.000
I might.

34:08.458 --> 34:10.832
Sweetie, that was
better than Philadelphia.

34:10.916 --> 34:12.791
- Really?
- It took everything from me

34:12.875 --> 34:15.624
- not to leap right into the orchestra.
- You're too kind.

34:15.708 --> 34:20.375
Did I tell you about the girl?
The girl that I wrote letters... Felicia.

34:22.041 --> 34:23.875
- The one I wrote about.
- Yes, yes.

34:27.750 --> 34:30.750
This is David and he plays the clarinet.
What else does he--

34:31.791 --> 34:33.832
- I play the clarinet.
- I can see.

34:33.916 --> 34:35.957
- And he's extraordinary.
- Yes.

34:36.041 --> 34:39.124
Oh, well, I was listening,
you were wonderful.

34:39.208 --> 34:41.457
You as well. Broadway star.

34:41.541 --> 34:43.000
Oh, no.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.957
We're gonna have lunch
with Kouss, otherwise we'd...

34:47.041 --> 34:49.249
What about later?
Have a drink or something?

34:49.333 --> 34:51.333
I would love that, yeah.

34:54.250 --> 34:57.208
- I didn't mean to spring that on you.
- No, that's all right.

34:58.208 --> 35:00.125
- Maybe that was insensitive of me.
- No.

35:00.958 --> 35:01.958
Not at all.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.458
- So, we'll see you later on.
- Yes.

35:07.500 --> 35:11.541
Okay, let's go. Come on.
Come on, little birdy!

35:12.125 --> 35:14.666
- Lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

35:30.166 --> 35:33.582
Oh, life is not that serious.
Honest, it isn't.

35:33.666 --> 35:36.582
What age are we living in?
One can be as free as one likes

35:36.666 --> 35:39.374
without guilt or confession.
Please, what's the harm?

35:39.458 --> 35:42.291
I know exactly who you are.

35:43.916 --> 35:44.916
Let's...

35:46.916 --> 35:48.000
give it a whirl.

36:03.250 --> 36:04.458
- Yes.
- Yes?

36:05.458 --> 36:06.957
- I mean--
- No!

36:07.041 --> 36:08.666
- Not here.
- No, not here.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.750
No, it's not how I meant it to be.

36:15.125 --> 36:18.333
Leonard Bernstein is
a composer, conductor and pianist.

36:19.208 --> 36:21.791
His wife, Felicia Montealegre,
is an actress.

36:21.875 --> 36:25.624
Both lead full, professional lives,
but they're seldom apart.

36:25.708 --> 36:28.124
Mr. Bernstein is 37 years old

36:28.208 --> 36:30.916
but he has been in the public eye
for a dozen years.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.499
From the time
he substituted for Bruno Walter

36:33.583 --> 36:36.250
to conduct the Philharmonic Symphony
at the age of 25,

36:36.833 --> 36:40.457
since then, Leonard Bernstein has
conducted or played all over the world.

36:40.541 --> 36:43.332
And he's written
symphonies, ballets, and opera,

36:43.416 --> 36:46.499
as well as scores
for the Broadway musical <i>Wonderful Town</i>

36:46.583 --> 36:48.666
and the motion picture <i>On the Waterfront.</i>

36:49.291 --> 36:52.457
Felicia Montealegre came to Broadway
and American television

36:52.541 --> 36:54.207
from Santiago, Chile.

36:54.291 --> 36:57.708
She was one of television's first
full-fledged dramatic stars.

36:59.458 --> 37:02.291
The Bernsteins, Leonard, Felicia
and their children,

37:02.375 --> 37:04.749
Jamie and two-months-old Alexander,

37:04.833 --> 37:07.666
live in New York City
near Carnegie Hall and Broadway.

37:08.291 --> 37:10.291
They've been here for about three years.

37:10.375 --> 37:11.791
Good evening, Felicia.

37:11.875 --> 37:13.499
- Hello, Ed.
- Good evening, Lenny.

37:13.583 --> 37:14.957
- How are you, Ed?
- Good.

37:15.041 --> 37:16.416
Lenny, it's always, for me,

37:16.500 --> 37:18.832
rather difficult
to classify you professionally

37:18.916 --> 37:21.124
since you do so many things
at the same time.

37:21.208 --> 37:23.416
What do you consider
your primary occupation?

37:23.500 --> 37:27.625
I guess I'd have to say that
my primary occupation is musician.

37:28.458 --> 37:31.041
Anything that has to
do with music is my province,

37:31.125 --> 37:33.582
wouldn't you say?
Whether it's composing it

37:33.666 --> 37:36.832
or conducting it, or teaching it,
or studying it, or playing it.

37:36.916 --> 37:39.124
As long as it's music,
I like it and I do it.

37:39.208 --> 37:42.082
Felicia, do you have trouble
keeping up with Lenny's activities?

37:42.166 --> 37:44.999
It gets pretty hard.
He's taken on many activities.

37:45.083 --> 37:47.291
This season promises to be
a very hectic one.

37:47.375 --> 37:49.707
Among them,
he's writing two musical shows.

37:49.791 --> 37:51.749
One of them is an adaptation,

37:51.833 --> 37:54.249
<i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> that's <i>West Side Story</i>

37:54.333 --> 37:56.457
with Jerry Robbins and Arthur Laurents

37:56.541 --> 37:59.416
and wonderfully-talented young lyricist
Stevie Sondheim.

37:59.500 --> 38:02.499
And then he's doing
four feature presentations

38:02.583 --> 38:05.499
in <i>Omnibus,</i> the CBS television program.

38:05.583 --> 38:06.583
And, um...

38:08.166 --> 38:10.916
- Was that right?
- You know my schedule better than I do.

38:11.375 --> 38:12.749
Felicia, what about you?

38:12.833 --> 38:15.250
Are you engaged in other things
besides acting?

38:15.958 --> 38:20.624
Well, it gets pretty hard to do much more
than take care of this household.

38:20.708 --> 38:26.541
My husband, the children, and acting takes
the rest of the time that's left over.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.332
- And memorizing my projects.
- Well...

38:29.416 --> 38:30.832
I can't help that.

38:30.916 --> 38:33.082
Lenny, what's the big difference
in the life

38:33.166 --> 38:35.791
of Composer Bernstein
and Conductor Bernstein?

38:36.666 --> 38:37.500
Well, I sup...

38:38.583 --> 38:40.583
I suppose it's a difference. It's...

38:41.333 --> 38:44.207
a personality difference
which occurs between any composer

38:44.291 --> 38:47.375
versus any...
or any creator versus any performer.

38:48.333 --> 38:50.499
Any performer, whether it's

38:50.583 --> 38:53.249
Toscanini or Tallulah Bankhead,
whoever it is,

38:53.333 --> 38:54.958
leads a kind of public life.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.582
An extrovert life, if you will.

38:57.666 --> 39:00.291
It's an oversimplified word,
but something like that.

39:00.375 --> 39:03.666
Whereas a creative person, uh,

39:04.000 --> 39:07.082
sits alone in this great studio
that you see here

39:07.166 --> 39:09.000
and writes all by himself and...

39:09.875 --> 39:12.958
communicates with the world
in a very private way and...

39:14.125 --> 39:16.125
and lives a rather...

39:17.083 --> 39:20.500
grand inner life
rather than a grand outer life.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.291
And if you carry around
both personalities...

39:27.500 --> 39:31.124
I suppose that means you become
a schizophrenic and that's the end of it.

39:31.208 --> 39:34.041
Felicia, you must be
interested in music too, aren't you?

39:38.750 --> 39:39.958
Daddy.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.208
Daddy!

39:44.166 --> 39:45.291
Catch!

39:57.750 --> 39:59.916
Well, I love you too, darling.

40:01.083 --> 40:02.583
So much. Thank you.

40:13.791 --> 40:16.416
Well, hello, children of Zeus!

40:16.500 --> 40:17.499
My man!

40:17.583 --> 40:19.208
- Hello, Lenny.
- Hello.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.249
What a lovely surprise.

40:21.333 --> 40:22.957
That's why I love New York City.

40:23.041 --> 40:24.374
Come out of your apartment

40:24.458 --> 40:27.291
and all of sudden
you just run into people that you love.

40:27.375 --> 40:29.708
- I'm going downtown. Oh.
- So am I.

40:30.458 --> 40:32.874
Well, we're cutting
across the park to go to Saks

40:32.958 --> 40:36.582
- before the deluge.
- Who are you? Hello. Hello.

40:36.666 --> 40:40.082
Hello, you're so beautiful.
You're so precious.

40:40.166 --> 40:41.583
Can I tell you a secret?

40:42.125 --> 40:44.457
Do you know
I slept with both your parents?

40:44.541 --> 40:46.041
Too much, isn't it? Too much.

40:46.125 --> 40:48.832
I love too much, what can I say?
But I'm reining it in.

40:48.916 --> 40:51.208
I'm reining it in!

41:42.541 --> 41:45.166
See those people across the avenue
staring at us?

41:47.333 --> 41:50.625
Saying, "It can't be him.
He's much better-looking on television."

41:51.875 --> 41:54.833
"Certainly has Leonard Bernstein's ears
though, doesn't he?"

41:57.833 --> 41:59.666
"Can that be him? Is that possible?"

42:07.333 --> 42:10.166
How embarrassing.
We don't even have silverware.

42:10.250 --> 42:12.250
- Here.
- Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

42:12.958 --> 42:14.958
What's wrong with the silverware?
We don't need it.

42:15.083 --> 42:17.250
I ordered the Chinese food, remember?

42:18.500 --> 42:21.124
The problem is we need those
fucking curtains so I can sleep.

42:21.208 --> 42:23.041
Walk around like a zombie.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.124
Scare all our children.

42:25.208 --> 42:27.957
- Do we have children in this house?
- We do.

42:28.041 --> 42:30.457
I don't know how the Bergs do it.
Three children.

42:30.541 --> 42:32.791
Three! I know, it's unbelievable.
Unreasonable.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.832
Alex doesn't make any noise.
I think we'll be fine.

42:35.916 --> 42:37.541
- No, for now.
- Sleeps all day.

42:37.625 --> 42:40.791
- Alexander, our sleeping little baby.
- He won't sleep for long.

42:40.875 --> 42:43.291
- It's like he isn't even real.
- No.

42:43.916 --> 42:45.208
Dream baby.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.083
I'm sad, darling, and I don't know why.

42:53.291 --> 42:57.124
Darling, you're so tired.
You just need to sleep.

42:57.208 --> 42:58.666
Yes.

43:01.333 --> 43:05.166
Summer sang in me a little while,
it sings in me no more.

43:08.083 --> 43:09.583
Edna St. Vincent Millay.

43:10.750 --> 43:12.750
If the summer doesn't sing in you,

43:14.000 --> 43:15.833
then nothing sings in you.

43:17.416 --> 43:19.250
And if nothing sings in you,

43:20.458 --> 43:22.083
then you can't make music.

43:29.166 --> 43:32.582
There's a price for being
in my brother's orbit, you know that.

43:32.666 --> 43:35.499
As much as he'd love to believe
the opposite is true.

43:35.583 --> 43:37.916
I suppose
I do understand what you mean.

43:38.833 --> 43:40.457
Well, it's very strange, but I...

43:40.541 --> 43:43.166
I do believe there is that in everybody.

43:43.250 --> 43:47.874
One wishes to make adjustments to oneself.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.083
This way.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
But...

43:53.875 --> 43:56.207
having this imposition
of a strong personality,

43:56.291 --> 43:57.708
it's like a way of death.

43:58.541 --> 43:59.375
Really.

43:59.916 --> 44:02.541
Yet the moment I see that
that is making him suffer,

44:03.083 --> 44:04.791
well, I realize it's not worth it.

44:05.416 --> 44:07.457
No. What for? It isn't going to kill me.

44:07.541 --> 44:10.666
If it was going to give him pleasure
or stop him from suffering

44:10.750 --> 44:13.249
and it's in my power to do it
then what the hell?

44:13.333 --> 44:16.958
But one has to do it
completely without sacrifice.

44:17.708 --> 44:21.708
And if there's going to be a sacrifice,
then I disappear.

44:23.625 --> 44:24.625
Good?

44:25.250 --> 44:26.458
Oh!

44:31.541 --> 44:34.500
That time, that time really was good!

47:49.875 --> 47:51.333
- Wicker!
- Oh, my God!

47:51.875 --> 47:55.291
White antique wicker
with Pierre Deux cushions.

47:55.375 --> 47:57.916
- I love it.
- It will give it that

47:58.000 --> 48:00.750
whimsical, Victorian conservatory look.

48:01.500 --> 48:05.916
So you want to lock me up in a
glass cage like some sort of exotic bird.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.208
I'm surrounded by men
and it feels so right.

48:10.666 --> 48:11.874
They are really better.

48:11.958 --> 48:15.791
I think Felicia is... I don't know...
I just can't make heads or tails of her.

48:16.333 --> 48:18.666
She's fine. She's just, you know, I mean...

48:18.750 --> 48:21.666
Are you all right? Do you need
to get a towel or something?

48:21.750 --> 48:24.666
Julia! Julia! Julia!

48:24.750 --> 48:25.957
I think we need a towel.

48:26.041 --> 48:28.457
It's that you're so distracted
all the time.

48:28.541 --> 48:30.374
I'm going to go take a big dump.

48:30.458 --> 48:32.125
Okay, wonderful.

48:32.833 --> 48:35.541
- Oh, my God.
- Has Daddy mentioned anything about

48:35.625 --> 48:38.541
- Harry and Amberson this summer?
- No.

48:38.625 --> 48:41.707
Oh, Harry's offering me a job
at Amberson this summer.

48:41.791 --> 48:42.791
What do you think?

48:43.916 --> 48:46.666
- What does Daddy say?
- Daddy thinks it's a great idea.

48:46.750 --> 48:47.957
Then I think it's great.

48:48.041 --> 48:49.582
- So I have your blessing?
- Yes.

48:49.666 --> 48:51.500
- Thank you. Bye.
- I love you. Bye.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.083
- She looks so grown up.
- Looks can be deceiving.

48:55.833 --> 48:57.582
I got the go ahead.

48:57.666 --> 48:59.082
Thank you so much.

48:59.166 --> 49:01.916
Be really good at this. Be really good.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.624
- So happy.
- You're intimidating me. I'll try my best.

49:04.708 --> 49:06.916
I just got trampled on in my own house.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.999
Come here.
I want you to meet a few people.

49:09.083 --> 49:10.999
This guy almost trampled all over me.

49:11.083 --> 49:13.082
- I was decapitated--
- Listen to me--

49:13.166 --> 49:15.832
- I know, I'm tired, please--
- This is Lenny.

49:15.916 --> 49:18.332
- Hello! How are you?
- This is Charlie.

49:18.416 --> 49:20.207
All my hands are taken.

49:20.291 --> 49:22.332
- You're a big fellow. Grand man.
- Jim.

49:22.416 --> 49:24.291
You're a huge fellow. Hello, Charlie.

49:24.375 --> 49:26.666
Pleasure. How are you? Having a good time?

49:27.250 --> 49:28.666
Lenny should be composing.

49:28.750 --> 49:30.749
- Well...
- No, Harry loves to play it

49:30.833 --> 49:33.958
on the side of him with the appearances
and the recordings and...

49:34.750 --> 49:36.374
cookie-cutter boys.

49:36.458 --> 49:38.041
- You know, he's not my favorite.
- My favorite.

49:38.125 --> 49:40.125
No, I know, he's not my favorite.

49:40.750 --> 49:41.916
- Well...
- Well...

49:42.000 --> 49:43.999
- You're taking it like a champ.
- You are.

49:44.083 --> 49:46.291
- I would never know.
- Handling it quite well.

49:46.375 --> 49:47.832
- Our little Joan of Arc.
- Yes.

49:47.916 --> 49:50.874
But remember what happened to Joan.
Didn't work out so well.

49:50.958 --> 49:52.166
So bored.

49:55.458 --> 49:57.291
- Hello, Scott.
- Hello.

49:58.958 --> 50:01.791
We don't say that in our family.
Felicia doesn't like it.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.082
- In your family?
- In my family.

50:04.166 --> 50:05.374
Your family, Lenny?

50:09.041 --> 50:10.875
Okay, that's enough.

50:12.458 --> 50:16.083
- We've been together for ten years.
- Believe me, I know three of them.

50:16.291 --> 50:18.499
I guess denial is
not just a river in Egypt.

50:18.583 --> 50:21.416
- That was the crossword. Three letters.
- Really?

50:22.041 --> 50:23.082
Pun.

50:23.166 --> 50:24.832
- Yes, it is "pun".
- Yes, it is.

50:24.916 --> 50:26.416
- Did you do it Thursday?
- Yes.

50:26.500 --> 50:28.000
- It's quite easy, but--
- Yeah.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.416
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Tommy.

50:30.500 --> 50:33.249
Did you just appear
out of my handkerchief?

50:33.333 --> 50:35.041
- I live here now.
- Are you a genie?

50:35.125 --> 50:36.707
- I wish.
- Do I get three wishes?

50:36.791 --> 50:39.000
- What's your first wish? Hi.
- My first wish.

50:40.083 --> 50:41.708
Good luck. Bye, Tommy.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.666
Sorry, I don't even know if you--

50:45.750 --> 50:47.249
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

50:47.333 --> 50:49.291
- Felicia puts it together.
- She does a good job.

50:49.375 --> 50:51.874
If I was left to my devices,
I'd be dressed like a clown.

50:51.958 --> 50:53.832
That's the truth. Don't tell anybody.

50:53.916 --> 50:57.166
Mind if I smoke in the other room?
Where do you live? Who are you?

50:57.250 --> 50:59.291
- I'm from San Francisco.
- So you're from Earth?

50:59.875 --> 51:00.957
Originally, yes.

51:01.041 --> 51:03.249
- Your hair is glorious.
- That's sweet of you.

51:03.333 --> 51:05.791
Listen, I have to go to the roof.
I need some air.

51:05.875 --> 51:08.124
- Would you mind to come with me?
- I'd love to.

51:08.208 --> 51:10.457
That's wonderful. Come here.
Tommy, is it?

51:10.541 --> 51:12.166
- Toast of the party.
- Belle of the ball.

51:12.250 --> 51:13.541
The belle of the ball!

51:13.625 --> 51:16.666
- My God, are you kidding me?
- Both at the same time. Somehow.

51:16.750 --> 51:20.083
A highwire act. Toast bell. Toast bell.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.624
Have you seen Lenny anywhere?

51:26.708 --> 51:28.208
Do you want me to fetch him?

51:29.125 --> 51:30.041
No, I don't mind.

51:30.666 --> 51:33.291
That's what I'm saying,
that I needed the turtleneck.

51:33.375 --> 51:35.874
I needed the turtleneck,
you know what I'm saying?

51:35.958 --> 51:38.083
I mean, that's the...
As I break this fucking wall.

51:39.291 --> 51:41.791
- How will we solve this problem?
- I don't know what to do.

51:41.875 --> 51:44.499
I'm worried about it.
We have to figure it out.

51:44.583 --> 51:47.332
Well, don't they...
Do your listeners know what you look like?

51:47.416 --> 51:49.832
The problem is you're in radio,
you need to be in television.

51:49.916 --> 51:52.541
- Stop.
- You're gorgeous. May I?

51:57.791 --> 51:59.208
Darling, this is Tommy.

52:01.041 --> 52:02.666
- Everything okay?
- It's okay.

52:03.916 --> 52:04.750
Darling.

52:05.666 --> 52:07.791
Why don't you go through here? It's fine.

52:08.625 --> 52:10.041
- Darling.
- No.

52:10.125 --> 52:12.374
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

52:12.458 --> 52:15.291
Fix your hair. You're getting sloppy.

52:35.125 --> 52:39.916
Well, like it or not,
this world is utterly fascinated,

52:40.000 --> 52:43.166
obsessed even, with everything about you.

52:44.166 --> 52:48.000
Ever since that famous phone call
which led to your debut at Carnegie Hall.

52:49.041 --> 52:51.082
And you have not let them down, my dear.

52:51.166 --> 52:55.166
Fifteen years on television, teaching us
all the magic of classical music,

52:55.916 --> 52:58.124
the <i>Young People's Concerts</i> and <i>Omnibus</i>

52:58.208 --> 53:00.624
reaching hundreds of millions
all over the world,

53:00.708 --> 53:02.624
ten years at the New York Philharmonic

53:02.708 --> 53:04.625
and then there are the compositions.

53:06.125 --> 53:08.541
<i>West Side Story</i> redefined
the American musical.

53:08.625 --> 53:11.249
- Jesus Christ.
- Then there's <i>Candide</i> and <i>On the Town.</i>

53:11.333 --> 53:14.541
Actually, when you add it up,
there's not much that I've created.

53:15.583 --> 53:18.000
Music is... I don't...

53:18.875 --> 53:22.958
I know this is gonna sound strange,
it was the most important thing I could do

53:24.041 --> 53:26.875
and a great source
of dissatisfaction that I haven't

53:28.125 --> 53:29.457
created that much at all.

53:29.541 --> 53:32.375
I mean, when you add it up,
it's not a very long list.

53:32.958 --> 53:33.958
Well...

53:34.666 --> 53:35.875
What this is...

53:36.666 --> 53:40.500
This is an opportunity for the world
to get to know you apart from all that.

53:41.250 --> 53:44.957
This book is to understand what
you think about in your private moments.

53:45.041 --> 53:49.666
Your personal feelings on,
well, on life as you know it.

53:50.791 --> 53:53.416
I feel like the world is
on the verge of collapse.

53:53.500 --> 53:54.708
That's what I feel like.

53:59.166 --> 54:00.583
I'm quite serious.

54:01.458 --> 54:03.291
- Yes.
- The diminution of creativity,

54:03.375 --> 54:05.083
which has come to a grinding halt.

54:06.291 --> 54:10.125
I mean, not scientifically.
That has exploded.

54:11.416 --> 54:14.416
But as we sit here,
I find it very difficult to...

54:16.791 --> 54:17.791
think that...

54:18.500 --> 54:20.416
whether I'm a conductor or a composer,

54:20.500 --> 54:22.666
of any note, has any bearing on anything.

54:22.750 --> 54:26.166
Or that my existence is
even worth talking about for this book.

54:26.250 --> 54:28.250
No, I agree. I agree.

54:29.500 --> 54:32.957
I think this has marked many artists
and you can see it in their work.

54:33.041 --> 54:35.666
This seems to seep into the subconscious

54:35.750 --> 54:39.332
- so that there's this great depression--
- But I know that Felicia...

54:39.416 --> 54:41.416
She senses it enormously.

54:41.500 --> 54:42.708
It's all pervasive.

54:44.416 --> 54:46.916
It's almost as if she can't
enjoy anything anymore.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
I know.

54:48.708 --> 54:51.125
- It just seems so sad.
- A picnic...

54:52.458 --> 54:54.625
the water, lunch...

54:55.541 --> 54:57.166
sitting around being together.

54:57.250 --> 54:58.333
What is that?

55:00.791 --> 55:03.124
I think she has a keen sense of futility.

55:03.208 --> 55:05.041
I sense that too about her.

55:05.791 --> 55:08.874
I had no idea
because I had this feeling of her first,

55:08.958 --> 55:11.457
incredibly, which she is, vivacious

55:11.541 --> 55:13.541
and marvelously alert and aware

55:13.625 --> 55:15.374
and a happy person,

55:15.458 --> 55:17.666
but something in her seems crushed.

55:18.791 --> 55:20.541
She said to me in Vienna last month,

55:21.333 --> 55:24.208
"I want to get off.
I want to stop the bus and get off."

55:24.791 --> 55:25.875
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

55:27.291 --> 55:28.875
And how do you feel about that?

55:29.916 --> 55:33.916
I have one or two saving factors.
One is it that I love people,

55:35.041 --> 55:38.207
and I love music. I love music so much
it keeps me glued to life

55:38.291 --> 55:39.957
even when I'm most depressed.

55:40.041 --> 55:41.875
And I can get very deeply depressed.

55:45.125 --> 55:47.749
But I have a work ethic
and that keeps me afloat.

55:47.833 --> 55:50.375
And the other is that
I love people so much that...

55:51.166 --> 55:52.666
it's hard for me to be alone.

55:55.916 --> 55:58.124
Which is part of my struggle
as a composer.

55:58.208 --> 55:59.457
Yes.

55:59.541 --> 56:01.166
You are the only person I've met

56:01.250 --> 56:04.125
who leaves the bathroom door open
for fear of being alone.

56:05.083 --> 56:07.000
I mean, can one really believe that

56:08.666 --> 56:10.291
man is just this trapped

56:11.291 --> 56:12.624
animal.

56:12.708 --> 56:15.916
He's a victim
of his own greeds and follies and...

56:21.791 --> 56:25.625
Either one believes in the divine element
in this or one doesn't.

56:26.583 --> 56:28.208
As long as I believe it...

56:29.666 --> 56:31.916
which I assume is
why I love people so much,

56:32.000 --> 56:33.832
then I have to believe that

56:33.916 --> 56:37.541
in some remote corner of my soul
there is a way out.

56:40.958 --> 56:42.833
<i>Okay, so, sopranos...</i>

56:44.333 --> 56:45.541
you're on the hot seat.

56:47.333 --> 56:50.041
Take it from bar 44, just from the end of
"Make our garden grow,

56:50.125 --> 56:52.999
make our garden grow,"
heading to the a cappella.

56:53.083 --> 56:55.125
And, sopranos, make sure that you...

56:56.250 --> 56:58.833
make space so that
the high notes can soar.

58:51.000 --> 58:54.208
- It means--
- It is... "I'm dying

58:54.916 --> 58:56.750
and I'm growing a hernia."

58:58.500 --> 59:00.207
It's an old Chilean expression.

59:00.291 --> 59:02.457
I was desperate to find a rhyme,
I couldn't.

59:02.541 --> 59:05.457
- I woke her up--
- Your mother was from Rovno Gubernia.

59:05.541 --> 59:07.457
In the middle of the night, desperate.

59:07.541 --> 59:09.374
There's a Chilean idiom, top of her head.

59:09.458 --> 59:11.374
You woke me up from a very deep sleep.

59:11.458 --> 59:12.957
It's the exact piece.

59:13.041 --> 59:15.332
In fact, all of the Spanish here
is all from Felicia.

59:15.416 --> 59:18.624
We're lucky that she's here today
to help with the pronunciation.

59:18.708 --> 59:20.499
That's right. I'm sorry, I've been...

59:20.583 --> 59:24.207
I was looking through Voltaire's work
and I couldn't find Rovno Gubernia.

59:24.291 --> 59:26.375
That's because I made it up, my dear boy.

59:45.916 --> 59:47.333
Let's see what you think.

59:47.958 --> 59:49.791
- See what you think.
- This is gorgeous.

59:49.875 --> 59:51.291
I know, isn't it lovely?

59:53.416 --> 59:55.250
- All right, there you go.
- Thank you.

59:55.875 --> 59:57.500
Come on. Let's go.

01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:03.707
Lenny, what do you want me to get?

01:00:03.791 --> 01:00:06.875
You could just get that big-ass bag
of kibble.

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:11.958
Oh, Lord. Thank you.

01:00:14.666 --> 01:00:15.750
It's Jamie.

01:00:16.458 --> 01:00:18.083
And I wanted to have a drink.

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:28.958
Daddy!

01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:30.875
Hello, darling.

01:00:42.416 --> 01:00:44.749
Help yourself after. Just go right there.

01:00:44.833 --> 01:00:46.207
Is this all Felicia's idea?

01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:48.416
I had nothing to do with it.
Her painting as well.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.083
- So beautiful.
- Lenny.

01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:02.207
- What is it, darling?
- Have you seen Jamie?

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.541
- I have not seen Jamie.
- You haven't seen her?

01:01:04.625 --> 01:01:05.625
No.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.625
- Why? Is she here?
- Yes, she's here.

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:12.457
She's terribly upset, darling.

01:01:12.541 --> 01:01:13.791
What is she upset about?

01:01:13.875 --> 01:01:15.707
She's been hearing gossip.

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:17.791
- Excuse me?
- Gossip.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:19.875
- Gossip about what?
- About you, darling.

01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:24.291
What about me?

01:01:24.375 --> 01:01:27.332
I don't know.
She's been up at Tanglewood all summer.

01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:29.416
I can't imagine what she might've heard.

01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:33.041
Well, what did you tell her?

01:01:33.708 --> 01:01:37.583
Darling, it's not for me really to say.
I said she should speak to you.

01:01:41.458 --> 01:01:43.166
She's old enough, don't you think?

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:46.333
I don't care how old she is,
I ask that you be discreet.

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:52.207
I think she's completely at an age
where she needs to, deserves to know.

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:55.041
I mean, darling,
she didn't ask for any of this.

01:01:55.125 --> 01:01:58.541
- It was my decision.
- Well, no, it's our decision.

01:02:00.708 --> 01:02:01.708
It's not just yours.

01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:10.083
Don't you dare tell her the truth.

01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:20.458
Jamiery Creamery.

01:02:23.041 --> 01:02:25.249
- Welcome home.
- Well, look at this.

01:02:25.333 --> 01:02:26.666
Hello.

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.875
- Hi.
- Hello. Wow.

01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:31.791
Not what I expected.

01:02:31.875 --> 01:02:33.791
Did you write a new song or something?

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:36.791
I was reading. Keeping my journal.
You have a nice trip?

01:02:36.875 --> 01:02:39.083
- Did you see Tommy?
- Oh, yes, he waved.

01:02:39.708 --> 01:02:42.707
I thought that would make you happy.
He's gonna spend the weekend.

01:02:42.791 --> 01:02:43.625
Wonderful.

01:02:44.708 --> 01:02:47.374
Smart as a whip, that boy.
Keeps me on my toes.

01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:48.957
See how he does the anagrams.

01:02:49.041 --> 01:02:50.041
He's a sweet boy.

01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:52.666
Yeah, you know,
your mother told me that you...

01:02:53.541 --> 01:02:55.708
are very upset
because you heard some rumors

01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:58.541
about me at Tanglewood this summer.

01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:01.499
I really wish
she wouldn't have said anything.

01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:03.416
- Jamie...
- It's fine, it's no big deal.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.957
- It is a big deal because you're upset.
- I wasn't upset.

01:03:06.041 --> 01:03:07.208
So let's discuss it.

01:03:08.875 --> 01:03:11.082
Your mother and I
have talked about it and...

01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:13.666
I said I'd come down here
and talk to you about it.

01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:16.957
- I--
- Try to enlighten or shed some sort of

01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:19.457
understanding on
what could've happened, so...

01:03:19.541 --> 01:03:21.999
- Jealousy is the word that I would use.
- What?

01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:23.166
Jealousy.

01:03:25.666 --> 01:03:26.750
When I was a...

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.125
student at Curtis, there was a boy...

01:03:31.166 --> 01:03:34.541
Seemed like a nice boy. Brought a pistol
to school, tried to kill me

01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:37.041
because he was jealous of my musical...

01:03:38.541 --> 01:03:40.541
- talent.
- Your musical talent.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:44.250
It just drove him to the brink of murder.

01:03:45.875 --> 01:03:49.082
Artur Rodziński was the musical director
of the New York Philharmonic.

01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:51.916
God told him to hire me.

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:55.625
Tried to strangle me during a rehearsal.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.416
Because of jealousy.

01:03:59.875 --> 01:04:03.291
Now, I don't know what happened
or who said what or where,

01:04:04.125 --> 01:04:07.458
but I can only imagine that
it was spurned on by jealousy, darling.

01:04:08.291 --> 01:04:09.291
Jealousy of...

01:04:10.791 --> 01:04:12.416
Of whatever it is that I do

01:04:13.833 --> 01:04:17.250
that has plagued me all my life
and I apologize for plaguing you now.

01:04:20.416 --> 01:04:21.625
But I hope that helps.

01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:24.750
So the rumors aren't true?

01:04:30.208 --> 01:04:31.416
No, darling.

01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:38.125
Thank you...

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:41.250
for coming to talk to me.

01:04:49.625 --> 01:04:50.833
I'm relieved.

01:05:14.166 --> 01:05:16.249
- Let's go inside.
- What...

01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:17.541
All right, what color?

01:05:18.625 --> 01:05:19.957
Here we have--

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.666
We've got three shades
of the exact same red.

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:24.582
It's not the exact same red.

01:05:24.666 --> 01:05:26.082
This one apparently is blue.

01:05:26.166 --> 01:05:27.374
- I'm gonna try--
- Blue--

01:05:27.458 --> 01:05:29.875
So we're just giving up on anagrams, guys?

01:05:30.666 --> 01:05:32.166
You're gonna make it a design.

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:34.374
- Having a nail session.
- You're an artist.

01:05:34.458 --> 01:05:36.874
Look at this, it's a little checker.

01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:40.041
<i>I thought it was a good idea
for him to come for the weekend.</i>

01:05:40.125 --> 01:05:43.457
I know how much
Jamie loves being with him.

01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:46.166
- Jamie?
- You like him too, don't you?

01:05:51.458 --> 01:05:52.541
Yes, I do.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:55.999
Darling, if I've done

01:05:56.083 --> 01:05:57.749
- something wrong, tell me.
- No.

01:05:57.833 --> 01:06:01.166
No, I don't know why
Jamie is particularly...

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:05.082
I don't know why you said
she was particularly interested in...

01:06:05.166 --> 01:06:08.832
Well, Tommy is very, sort of,
warm, and he's highly intelligent,

01:06:08.916 --> 01:06:09.999
as is our daughter.

01:06:10.083 --> 01:06:13.207
- Okay.
- And--

01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:16.416
- No, I'm not saying that--
- No, I have an interest

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.999
in spending time with him too.

01:06:18.083 --> 01:06:21.832
I'm not trying to shove it off
that I brought him here for her.

01:06:21.916 --> 01:06:23.832
- Clearly not.
- Well, no, obviously not.

01:06:23.916 --> 01:06:26.833
All I'm saying is
that's just another reason why.

01:06:27.791 --> 01:06:29.957
- But I can easily tell him not to come.
- No.

01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:32.291
I misread the room, clearly.

01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:33.749
- No.
- I misread the room.

01:06:33.833 --> 01:06:36.541
Well, it's not really
about that. It's about...

01:06:41.416 --> 01:06:43.124
- What is it about?
- No, nothing.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:44.625
Okay. All right.

01:06:45.291 --> 01:06:46.375
So, then, it's fine?

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:48.125
Yes?

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:50.332
- Yes.
- All right, darling.

01:06:50.416 --> 01:06:51.582
I'll do it. Okay.

01:06:51.666 --> 01:06:52.874
- What?
- No, I just...

01:06:52.958 --> 01:06:55.082
Nothing. I thought
we were having a conversation.

01:06:55.166 --> 01:06:56.416
- But we were.
- No.

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.457
- I'm sorry. I thought we were finished.
- I know you're busy.

01:06:59.541 --> 01:07:01.916
I'm not busy,
I'm just desperate to finish this.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.041
Well, then, do it, darling.
I'm not stopping you. Do it.

01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:04.457
Where is everybody? Oh, they're here.

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:07.291
Hello, everyone,
I have an announcement to make.

01:09:07.375 --> 01:09:10.458
I have finished "Mass."

01:09:12.541 --> 01:09:13.750
Yay, Dad.

01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:16.333
Where is Mummy going?

01:13:05.958 --> 01:13:08.541
Julia, who left the Snoopy
in the vestibule?

01:13:09.291 --> 01:13:11.041
Hello, Brian. Alex.

01:13:11.833 --> 01:13:15.250
Who left...
Who abandoned Snoopy in the vestibule?

01:13:16.041 --> 01:13:18.624
- Who abandoned Snoopy?
- That was me. I'm sorry, Daddy.

01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:20.124
I mean, it's his day.

01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:23.082
- He started eating it...
- Daddy, you have to see me.

01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:25.082
- How many?
- Stop.

01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:27.666
- Why are you going on and on about this?
- How many?

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.457
- I'm so sorry.
- There was a woman--

01:13:29.541 --> 01:13:31.374
You're a day late for Thanksgiving.

01:13:31.458 --> 01:13:33.957
I know. Harry had me going all over.
I had to do--

01:13:34.041 --> 01:13:35.249
Nina was very upset.

01:13:35.333 --> 01:13:37.749
Well, I don't think...
Nina doesn't seem so upset.

01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:40.707
Did you hear her screaming
about some random woman?

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:42.416
You finally got her to come.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:45.416
- As a surprise for you--
- Daddy!

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.332
Of course. Thank you, Julia.

01:13:48.416 --> 01:13:50.082
Nina's not upset about the woman.

01:13:50.166 --> 01:13:52.624
She's upset about you
almost missing Thanksgiving.

01:13:52.708 --> 01:13:55.499
- We didn't know if you were coming.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:56.957
- Mike, please stay.
- Thanks.

01:13:57.041 --> 01:13:58.832
- I got to go down.
- Jamie, take him.

01:13:58.916 --> 01:14:00.541
- Yeah, come on, Mike.
- Thank you.

01:14:00.625 --> 01:14:03.124
- Do you want any snacks first?
- No, I'm good.

01:14:03.208 --> 01:14:04.416
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:14:18.125 --> 01:14:19.125
- Darling?
- Mmm.

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:25.957
For a second I thought...

01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:28.249
- It was quite a stunt that you pulled.
- What?

01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:31.250
- That was quite a stunt that you pulled.
- What do you mean?

01:14:31.833 --> 01:14:34.874
Well, darling, you put the pillow outside
and the slippers

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:38.291
and the toothpaste and the toothbrush
and I haven't seen you since.

01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:43.666
I understand you're angry with me.
Jesus Christ. But, I mean...

01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:46.291
let's be reasonable.

01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:50.625
There's a saying in Chile

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:55.666
about never standing under a bird
that's full of shit.

01:14:58.875 --> 01:15:00.500
And I've just been living

01:15:01.166 --> 01:15:03.000
under that fucking bird

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.416
for so long, it's actually become comedic.

01:15:13.833 --> 01:15:14.833
Well, I think...

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:19.291
- that you're letting your sadness get--
- Oh, stop it!

01:15:19.375 --> 01:15:21.749
- Let me finish...
- That has nothing to do with me...

01:15:21.833 --> 01:15:23.957
- ...what I'm going to say. I think...
- No.

01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:26.582
...you're letting your sadness
get the better of you.

01:15:26.666 --> 01:15:28.791
It's about you, so you should love it.

01:15:30.208 --> 01:15:32.999
You want to be sleepless
and depressed and sick.

01:15:33.083 --> 01:15:35.291
So you can avoid
fulfilling your obligations.

01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:37.666
- What obligations?
- To what you've been given.

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:39.374
The gift that you've been given.

01:15:39.458 --> 01:15:40.416
- Please.
- My God.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.957
The gift comes with burdens.
Do you have any idea?

01:15:43.041 --> 01:15:46.332
- The burden of feigning honesty and love.
- Sorry, that's the truth.

01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:49.541
That above all you love people
and from that wellspring of love

01:15:49.625 --> 01:15:51.499
the complications arise in your life.

01:15:51.583 --> 01:15:54.291
- That's exactly right.
- Wake up! Take off your glasses.

01:15:54.833 --> 01:15:58.457
Hate in your heart.
Hate in your heart and anger.

01:15:58.541 --> 01:16:00.666
There's so many things,
it's hard to count.

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:03.582
That's what drives you.
Deep, deep anger drives you.

01:16:03.666 --> 01:16:06.874
You aren't on that podium
allowing us to experience the music

01:16:06.958 --> 01:16:10.541
the way it was intended.
You are throwing it in our faces.

01:16:10.625 --> 01:16:13.291
- How dare you?
- How much we'll never be able to

01:16:13.375 --> 01:16:17.207
ever understand and by us
witnessing you do it so effortlessly,

01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:20.832
you hope that we will know, really know,
deep in our core

01:16:20.916 --> 01:16:23.332
- how less than we all are for you.
- That's your issue.

01:16:23.416 --> 01:16:25.374
- And it's your hubris--
- Join the crowd.

01:16:25.458 --> 01:16:28.999
You prance around with all your dewy-eyed
waiters that Harry corrals for you

01:16:29.083 --> 01:16:32.124
under the guise they have something
intellectual to offer you

01:16:32.208 --> 01:16:36.833
- while you are "teaching" them.
- Well, at least my heart is open.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.916
The audacity to say that!

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.041
Have you forgotten about the four years

01:16:43.125 --> 01:16:45.707
where you couldn't decide
if you wanted to marry me?

01:16:45.791 --> 01:16:47.707
- That's what I think.
- The idea of you?

01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:49.749
The Chamberlain movie we saw last week,

01:16:49.833 --> 01:16:52.749
he said, "How could I compete
with the man you think I am?"

01:16:52.833 --> 01:16:55.416
Thank God I met Dick so I could
fucking survive your indecision.

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.707
- Dick Hart. Richard Hart.
- Yes.

01:16:57.791 --> 01:16:59.624
- Who fucking died.
- Who loved me.

01:16:59.708 --> 01:17:01.207
- Who died.
- Who loved me.

01:17:01.291 --> 01:17:04.666
Yeah, he's a corpse now
and I was the one who was a fool

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:08.499
waiting outside the fucking hospital
for you like an idiot in my truth.

01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:10.832
Your truth is a fucking lie!

01:17:10.916 --> 01:17:14.624
It sucks up the energy in every room
and gives the rest of us zero opportunity

01:17:14.708 --> 01:17:16.749
to live or even breathe
as our true selves.

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:19.166
Your truth makes you brave and strong

01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:22.666
and saps the rest of us
of any kind of bravery or strength.

01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:24.583
Because it's so draining, Lenny.

01:17:25.291 --> 01:17:27.416
It's so draining to love
and accept someone

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.499
who doesn't love and accept themselves.

01:17:29.583 --> 01:17:31.791
And that's the only truth
I know about you.

01:17:36.166 --> 01:17:40.583
If you're not careful, you're going to die
a lonely, old queen.

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:44.208
Mommy! Daddy!

01:17:44.833 --> 01:17:46.041
Mom! Dad!

01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:47.916
- Daddy!
- Mom!

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.666
- Snoopy's here, hurry up!
- Come on.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.832
Mommy! You're missing Snoopy.

01:17:52.916 --> 01:17:54.749
What are you guys doing in there?

01:17:54.833 --> 01:17:57.041
- He's so big.
- You've been in there for ages.

01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:58.582
- Dad!
- Yes.

01:17:58.666 --> 01:17:59.666
Come on.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
I'll go.

01:18:18.541 --> 01:18:21.833
Hello.

01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:25.291
Hello. How are you?

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.041
Hello. Hello. How are you?

01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:32.416
Wonderful. Hello. Hello.

01:18:40.041 --> 01:18:41.250
What I love

01:18:41.875 --> 01:18:44.499
about these Thursday rehearsals

01:18:44.583 --> 01:18:48.166
is that we get a chance to talk to you
about what we think of the music.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.416
So, thank you for coming
and good afternoon.

01:18:52.291 --> 01:18:58.625
Um, today we're studying
Shostakovich's 14th Opus 135.

01:18:59.791 --> 01:19:01.791
What I realized about this piece...

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.916
It could be morbid,
but I tend to think that it's not...

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
...is that

01:19:08.791 --> 01:19:11.000
as death approaches...

01:19:13.083 --> 01:19:14.708
I believe that an artist must

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:18.583
cast off anything that's restraining him.

01:19:21.166 --> 01:19:22.250
And an artist

01:19:23.875 --> 01:19:27.875
must be resolute in creating,
whatever time he has left,

01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:30.958
in absolute freedom.

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:36.958
And that's why...

01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:41.250
I have to do this for myself,

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.208
I have to live...

01:19:45.083 --> 01:19:49.083
the rest of my life,
however long or short that may be,

01:19:49.916 --> 01:19:51.750
exactly the way that I want.

01:19:54.083 --> 01:19:56.500
As more and more of us are
in this day and age.

01:20:02.125 --> 01:20:05.707

And cut. Thank you.
That's the scene.

01:20:32.583 --> 01:20:35.749
My goodness. I don't think
my mouth has ever moved so fast.

01:20:35.833 --> 01:20:38.041
- You are sweet, Colin.
- Here you are, Felicia.

01:20:40.208 --> 01:20:41.625
I'd love to do one more.

01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:44.583
- Yes, of course.
- If you don't mind.

01:20:47.791 --> 01:20:52.082
So, this thing where, remember if you hold
the score low you get a better bounce.

01:20:52.166 --> 01:20:53.707
Lower. I was doing it high.

01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:55.749
If we do it again,
I'd love to start at bar 44.

01:20:55.833 --> 01:20:58.499
And I do believe percussion
could be a little bit quiet.

01:20:58.583 --> 01:21:00.332
- Still have a headache?
- It's fine.

01:21:00.416 --> 01:21:01.666
- Cynthia.
- Do they realize

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:04.332
it's only a matter of time
before you direct the production?

01:21:04.416 --> 01:21:07.499
Already happening. The carpet
was a different color yesterday.

01:21:07.583 --> 01:21:10.457
- I was right about the carpet.
- I agree.

01:21:10.541 --> 01:21:13.166
I just forgot
how much I love being at work.

01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:15.499
- We're almost finished.
- Reservation can wait.

01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:18.166
- This is such a hoot. Really.
- Wait.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.624
I thought tonight was
my night to take you out.

01:21:21.708 --> 01:21:24.874
Oh, you both have to stop
worrying about me. I'm fine.

01:21:24.958 --> 01:21:27.374
- I'm busier than ever.
- Better, not busier.

01:21:27.458 --> 01:21:30.291
Though, boy, that's true, isn't it?
I mean, doesn't the...

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:34.416
<i>Poor Murderer</i>
go into previews the next week?

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.332
Don't remind me.

01:21:35.416 --> 01:21:37.082
Who said anything about worrying?

01:21:37.166 --> 01:21:39.749
I'm just greedy to have
as much of you as I can get.

01:21:39.833 --> 01:21:41.291
I'm all yours.

01:21:43.625 --> 01:21:45.374
What were you talking about?

01:21:45.458 --> 01:21:46.749
I was talking about how...

01:21:46.833 --> 01:21:49.041
- What was I talking about?
- I can't remember.

01:21:49.625 --> 01:21:52.375
Maybe I was saying
how handsome everybody looks tonight.

01:21:53.833 --> 01:21:56.250
A lot of <i>hombres.</i> Lots.

01:21:57.333 --> 01:21:59.541
Chicken? That's what we call them.

01:21:59.625 --> 01:22:01.374
Always good with the chickens.

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:02.999
You really like the chickens.

01:22:03.083 --> 01:22:04.791
- I love the chickens.
- I know you do.

01:22:04.875 --> 01:22:06.708
- Harry, do I--
- Yeah.

01:22:10.375 --> 01:22:12.208
- Just do it off there.
- Yeah.

01:22:14.375 --> 01:22:16.207
- Did you get it?
- Like a pro.

01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:19.124
It's raining down on me
through your fucking nose.

01:22:19.208 --> 01:22:21.249
It's fine. Just right over here.

01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:24.791
Here you go. I'll just serve everybody.

01:22:30.416 --> 01:22:32.166
- Oh, Lenny--
- I'm fine. Thank you.

01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:34.541
- I'm sorry--
- It's okay. Thank you. It's fine.

01:22:34.625 --> 01:22:37.541
Jerry Robbins was right,
you can't maintain a relationship

01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:39.791
when you're living in various hotel rooms.

01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:41.624
- <i>You'll start to upset me now.</i>
- Listen.

01:22:41.708 --> 01:22:44.707
No, darling, no, I just wanted to...

01:22:44.791 --> 01:22:48.291
I called because I wanted to ask
what your plans were for the weekend.

01:22:48.375 --> 01:22:50.374
We're gonna be home in a couple of days.

01:22:50.458 --> 01:22:54.166
I thought we could all spend it in
Fairfield. You just have to nudge Mommy.

01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:55.666
<i>Who's we, Daddy?</i>

01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:58.166
No, I...

01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:01.082
Well, he's not a monster.

01:23:01.166 --> 01:23:02.916
He's an utterly brilliant...

01:23:04.666 --> 01:23:08.749
delightful fellow. He's my genius
little leprechaun. He's not even my type.

01:23:08.833 --> 01:23:10.041
<i>Daddy, please don't.</i>

01:23:10.791 --> 01:23:12.916
<i>Daddy, please don't talk to me about this.</i>

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Darling...

01:23:21.041 --> 01:23:23.416
I'm in awe of you.

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:31.916
I love you so, Jamie... I love you.

01:23:33.666 --> 01:23:34.875
<i>I know. I know.</i>

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:36.750
<i>I know.</i>

01:23:40.875 --> 01:23:42.708
I'll talk to Mummy again.

01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:45.000
<i>Okay, Daddy.</i>

01:23:46.958 --> 01:23:48.332
I don't know if you saw it,

01:23:48.416 --> 01:23:51.666
but you did get a wonderful mention
in <i>The New York Times</i> review.

01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:54.499
- Oh, really?
- I kept it for you. I thought I could--

01:23:54.583 --> 01:23:55.791
I don't wanna see it.

01:23:56.541 --> 01:23:58.707
No, it just makes me feel uncomfortable.

01:23:58.791 --> 01:24:00.374
But that's so sweet. Thank you.

01:24:00.458 --> 01:24:01.541
All right.

01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:03.041
How was Monday night?

01:24:03.833 --> 01:24:07.249
Monday... No, I don't think

01:24:07.333 --> 01:24:08.916
- I want to talk about it.
- Wait.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.999
- What happened on Monday night?
- Nothing.

01:24:11.083 --> 01:24:13.082
- Your mother has a suitor.
- No.

01:24:13.166 --> 01:24:15.583
Really?
No, please, let's talk about it.

01:24:16.333 --> 01:24:20.166
I think it's enough that
you are subjected to your father's affair.

01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:22.082
So, no, I don't think we need to.

01:24:22.166 --> 01:24:23.916
But, speaking of your father,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.416
I do have two performances
on Thanksgiving, so...

01:24:28.083 --> 01:24:30.457
I'll stay at the theater
and you'll eat with him

01:24:30.541 --> 01:24:32.374
at the apartment with Nina and Alex.

01:24:32.458 --> 01:24:35.374
For Nina's sake, let's maintain
some semblance of normalcy.

01:24:35.458 --> 01:24:37.875
- Doesn't feel normal to me.
- Well, I...

01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:40.082
I don't know what to say.

01:24:40.166 --> 01:24:43.124
- I'm running late to meet Alexander.
- Oh, come on.

01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:45.791
I am. You two clearly have
things to speak about.

01:24:45.875 --> 01:24:48.666
- No, don't do that.
- No, I'm gonna give you guys space

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:51.374
- to speak about it.
- That's not how we do things.

01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:53.457
Grownups don't do that.

01:24:53.541 --> 01:24:56.374
- I did make plans with Alexander--
- No. Darling.

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:59.082
We're not leaving like this.
Look at me in the eye.

01:24:59.166 --> 01:25:02.374
I can see how cross you are
and I don't want you to go like that.

01:25:02.458 --> 01:25:05.082
- I'm not cross with you.
- I don't believe you.

01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:06.208
Hold on.

01:25:07.583 --> 01:25:09.583
I am not angry with you, Mummy.

01:25:10.541 --> 01:25:12.291
You're a terrible liar.

01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:14.832
- At least you know you can trust me.
- That's true.

01:25:14.916 --> 01:25:16.832
- I'm gonna clear.
- No.

01:25:16.916 --> 01:25:18.749
- Got to make fun of him...
- I love you.

01:25:18.833 --> 01:25:21.666
For not coming to see you yet,
rave about your performance.

01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:23.166
Well, that'd be wonderful.

01:25:26.125 --> 01:25:27.957
Okay, now, tell me about the suitor.

01:25:28.041 --> 01:25:30.250
Oh, so, yes, the suitor...

01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:33.500
Uh, so...

01:25:34.916 --> 01:25:36.541
I was very excited, as you know.

01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:39.416
- I was very excited, as you know.
- I do.

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.624
- We went out for lunch, not dinner.
- Where?

01:25:41.708 --> 01:25:43.291
Café Carlyle, nothing fancy.

01:25:43.375 --> 01:25:46.791
And I was a little nervous,
I'll admit, so was he.

01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:50.332
So, halfway through the meal,
he leans over,

01:25:50.416 --> 01:25:54.499
and he asks if he can tell me a secret.

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:57.583
- He has a little crush, you see.
- Indeed.

01:25:58.791 --> 01:26:02.582
So, I smiled, I blushed a little
and I pushed him to tell me.

01:26:02.666 --> 01:26:04.875
He has a crush on Mendy

01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:08.166
and he wants me to introduce them.

01:26:09.416 --> 01:26:10.999
- Mendy Wager?
- Mendy.

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:13.583
Don't be so surprised.
Mendy's a very handsome man.

01:26:14.875 --> 01:26:16.875
- Felicia...
- There I was...

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:20.833
blushing, butterflies all-a-tremble, and...

01:26:21.583 --> 01:26:22.583
Well...

01:26:23.083 --> 01:26:25.208
seems I'm attracted to a certain type.

01:26:26.333 --> 01:26:27.750
Listen...

01:26:28.666 --> 01:26:31.874
You know, Lenny loves you, he really does.

01:26:31.958 --> 01:26:36.583
He's just... a man. A horribly aging man...

01:26:37.166 --> 01:26:41.957
who cannot just be wholly one thing.

01:26:42.041 --> 01:26:44.666
He's just... lost.

01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:46.500
I've always known who he is.

01:26:49.916 --> 01:26:51.125
He called me, you know.

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:53.375
And?

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:56.291
He wants us all to go
to Fairfield for two weeks.

01:26:57.125 --> 01:26:59.332
- He sounded different.
- Felicia...

01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:00.416
No, I...

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.124
Let's not make excuses. He didn't fail me.

01:27:04.208 --> 01:27:05.625
- Felicia...
- No, it's...

01:27:07.375 --> 01:27:08.791
It's my own arrogance

01:27:10.166 --> 01:27:12.791
to think I could survive
on what he could give.

01:27:14.083 --> 01:27:16.791
It's ironic. I would look at everyone,
even my children

01:27:16.875 --> 01:27:19.999
with such pity because
of their longing for his attention.

01:27:20.083 --> 01:27:22.832
It was sort of a banner
I wore so proudly,

01:27:22.916 --> 01:27:24.750
I don't need. I don't need.

01:27:25.458 --> 01:27:26.458
And...

01:27:27.541 --> 01:27:28.958
look at me now.

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.375
Who's the one who hasn't been honest?

01:27:38.291 --> 01:27:39.500
I miss him...

01:27:40.833 --> 01:27:42.250
that child of mine.

01:27:48.166 --> 01:27:49.250
Any questions?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Bravo!

01:34:25.833 --> 01:34:27.999
- It was amazing.
- Darling, why did you come?

01:34:28.083 --> 01:34:32.708
There is no hate...
There is no hate in your heart.

01:35:38.666 --> 01:35:41.291
- Mr. Bernstein, you can come back now.
- Oh, wonderful.

01:35:41.375 --> 01:35:43.458
- Wanna sit down?
- Yes.

01:35:44.791 --> 01:35:46.791
You seem like you need
your blood pressure taken.

01:35:46.875 --> 01:35:48.083
No, I'm fine.

01:35:51.541 --> 01:35:53.666
You know Betty's coming
for dinner tonight?

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:57.041
- I didn't know that.
- She is.

01:35:57.875 --> 01:36:00.291
And Mendy, which will be so nice.

01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:05.000
And Julia's gone to go and get fennel,
which you know Betty loves.

01:36:10.375 --> 01:36:12.916
Come in.

01:36:14.083 --> 01:36:15.750
- Hello.
- How are you?

01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:24.582
It looks like you have a tumor
of the right side of the left breast

01:36:24.666 --> 01:36:27.083
which may have metastasized to the lung.

01:36:28.083 --> 01:36:30.082
Given the size of the tumor,

01:36:30.166 --> 01:36:32.499
I would recommend
that we remove the breast,

01:36:32.583 --> 01:36:35.916
the underlying muscles
and the adjacent lymph nodes,

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.332
as well as do a biopsy of the lung

01:36:38.416 --> 01:36:41.291
which will help us confirm
whether there is spread or not.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.625
We could do all of this
early next week if you like.

01:36:46.041 --> 01:36:47.041
Yes.

01:36:48.083 --> 01:36:50.332
But I'm... Darling...

01:36:50.416 --> 01:36:52.499
- I'm starting a play in September.
- That's okay.

01:36:52.583 --> 01:36:55.250
- No, but I should let them know--
- I'll let them know.

01:36:56.041 --> 01:36:58.916
I think your recovery
will be faster than you think

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.208
and we can have you ready
within about one to two weeks.

01:37:02.875 --> 01:37:05.957
- That's wonderful news.
- You'll be able to do what you need to do.

01:37:06.041 --> 01:37:08.875
How can we be assured
that we get all the cancer?

01:37:10.041 --> 01:37:11.874
- Well--
- ...that we get all the cancer.

01:37:11.958 --> 01:37:15.499
We're not gonna compromise on that
for the play...

01:37:15.583 --> 01:37:18.332
Once we take off the breast,
there'll be no local cancer.

01:37:18.416 --> 01:37:20.582
We do have to determine about the lung.

01:37:20.666 --> 01:37:22.249
How long would the biopsy take?

01:37:22.333 --> 01:37:27.249
The biopsy, just minutes, and you'll be
sleeping from the other procedure.

01:37:27.333 --> 01:37:28.958
So, you do it... you do...

01:37:30.666 --> 01:37:32.166
You do both at the same time?

01:37:32.250 --> 01:37:35.833
Yeah, we do the breast and it'd be easy
to do the biopsy of the lung.

01:37:42.083 --> 01:37:43.916
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

01:37:44.958 --> 01:37:46.166
- I know...
- I know.

01:37:55.458 --> 01:37:57.082
- I know.
- That's so ridiculous.

01:37:57.166 --> 01:37:58.666
No, I know.

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:01.916
I'm so ridiculous.

01:38:03.250 --> 01:38:05.000
There, there. It's okay, darling.

01:38:16.666 --> 01:38:18.666
No, I don't really think so, darling.

01:38:28.375 --> 01:38:30.125
- Darling.
- Thank you.

01:38:34.083 --> 01:38:36.916
- Darling, let's take the park and walk.
- Really?

01:38:37.625 --> 01:38:38.625
Yes.

01:38:39.125 --> 01:38:40.541
Yes, let's get some air.

01:38:41.375 --> 01:38:42.458
Okay.

01:38:45.041 --> 01:38:46.541
- Oh, my God.
- You all right?

01:38:46.625 --> 01:38:47.832
No, I'm fine.

01:38:47.916 --> 01:38:50.624
- There's something wrong with my knee.
- I have an idea.

01:38:50.708 --> 01:38:51.708
Oh, no.

01:38:57.375 --> 01:38:59.000
Is that a lighter, darling?

01:39:00.041 --> 01:39:01.541
Mind your own business.

01:39:13.041 --> 01:39:14.458
I'm thinking of a number.

01:39:20.833 --> 01:39:23.416
- Oh, I don't know. Nine.
- No.

01:39:23.958 --> 01:39:25.791
- Five.
- No, you have to think.

01:39:26.625 --> 01:39:28.041
I'm trying to.

01:39:29.208 --> 01:39:30.291
I am trying to.

01:39:31.041 --> 01:39:32.541
- It's two, darling.
- Two.

01:39:32.625 --> 01:39:33.625
It's two.

01:39:34.125 --> 01:39:35.666
- Like us.
- Hmm?

01:39:36.291 --> 01:39:38.375
- Like us, a pair.
- Mmm.

01:39:39.833 --> 01:39:41.458
Two little ducks in a pond.

01:39:47.458 --> 01:39:49.125
Throw your weight on me, darling.

01:39:49.666 --> 01:39:52.874
That's it. Put all your weight on me.
Yes, that's it.

01:39:52.958 --> 01:39:54.583
Lean your head back. That's it.

01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:04.499
Oh, my dear.

01:40:04.583 --> 01:40:06.583
Hello, dears.

01:40:08.125 --> 01:40:09.125
Hello.

01:40:12.833 --> 01:40:14.041
Gorgeous.

01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:15.749
Missed you.

01:40:15.833 --> 01:40:17.250
Missed you so much.

01:40:18.625 --> 01:40:20.249
Mummy? You all right?

01:40:20.333 --> 01:40:21.958
I'm good. I'm fine.

01:40:24.916 --> 01:40:26.916
Did you have a nightmare getting here?

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.874
Of course.
This one was driving.

01:40:28.958 --> 01:40:31.332
- Oh, no.
- I don't think we could've gone

01:40:31.416 --> 01:40:34.707
- farther east if we'd tried.
- You know I hate driving.

01:40:34.791 --> 01:40:37.416
Oh, I wish I'd come earlier. Is there...

01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:40.750
Is there anything you need?

01:40:41.416 --> 01:40:42.625
Anything I can do?

01:40:45.166 --> 01:40:46.999
Never get another perm.

01:40:49.125 --> 01:40:51.249
That's what I said.

01:40:51.333 --> 01:40:53.082
Ramone said it was a triumph.

01:40:53.166 --> 01:40:55.291
It's a gigantic triumph.

01:40:59.041 --> 01:41:00.666
Where's Lenny?

01:41:01.416 --> 01:41:03.625
Oh, I don't know,
he's sleeping or something.

01:41:04.708 --> 01:41:06.333
Do you remember that...

01:41:06.958 --> 01:41:09.332
that bar mitzvah that you dragged me to,

01:41:09.416 --> 01:41:11.041
one of Alexander's friends?

01:41:11.125 --> 01:41:12.958
- The little... Yes.
- I do.

01:41:14.041 --> 01:41:15.041
With...

01:41:15.958 --> 01:41:17.249
Oh, what's his name?

01:41:17.333 --> 01:41:18.957
- Feldman. Yeah.
- Yes!

01:41:19.041 --> 01:41:23.208
So, we're there and I am, of course,
seated next to our dear Felicia here.

01:41:23.833 --> 01:41:26.250
And she looks stunning as usual.
Woe is me.

01:41:27.041 --> 01:41:30.499
And Lenny's about 25 pounds lighter.

01:41:30.583 --> 01:41:34.666
And tanned, just tanned,
all in white from head to toe,

01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:38.166
including white patent-leather shoes
with no socks.

01:41:38.916 --> 01:41:40.499
It was very <i>en vogue.</i>

01:41:40.583 --> 01:41:41.583
A lie.

01:41:43.416 --> 01:41:45.041
Well, at one point Lenny,

01:41:45.125 --> 01:41:48.124
he gets up, you know,
in that all-white attire

01:41:48.208 --> 01:41:51.916
and he makes his way
up to the lectern. Um...

01:41:53.125 --> 01:41:54.500
Yes.

01:42:07.708 --> 01:42:09.916
No, it's fine. The, um...

01:42:11.708 --> 01:42:14.208
- Lenny in the white suit.
- Yes.

01:42:15.333 --> 01:42:18.250
And he's all in white... and, um...

01:42:19.583 --> 01:42:20.583
he...

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.958
Uh, he goes up to the lectern and...

01:42:26.875 --> 01:42:29.208
- I don't think anybody asked him to speak.
- No.

01:42:30.083 --> 01:42:31.083
But...

01:42:31.791 --> 01:42:34.916
it took him 20 minutes
just to walk from our table up there,

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.957
stopping at every table he passed,
chit-chatting of course,

01:42:39.041 --> 01:42:42.041
and finally, he arrives up there
next to the frightened boy.

01:42:43.083 --> 01:42:45.916
And Felicia leans up to me

01:42:47.625 --> 01:42:49.250
without missing a beat and says,

01:42:49.791 --> 01:42:51.624
"And now we have the bride."

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
He's risen.

01:43:05.625 --> 01:43:06.624
Oh.

01:43:06.708 --> 01:43:08.916
- Oh, my God.
- A production.

01:43:19.291 --> 01:43:20.916
Watch it, Jamie.

01:43:35.041 --> 01:43:36.124
I'll see you.

01:43:36.208 --> 01:43:38.208
Okay. All right, bye. See you.

01:43:38.833 --> 01:43:39.833
Love you.

01:43:47.541 --> 01:43:49.166
I don't want any more visitors.

01:43:49.833 --> 01:43:52.249
No more. No more. I want to go to bed.

01:43:52.333 --> 01:43:53.333
Yes, okay.

01:43:54.166 --> 01:43:57.250
<i>Yes. No, you're gonna
have to cancel it. Yes.</i>

01:43:57.875 --> 01:43:58.791
Well...

01:43:59.541 --> 01:44:00.541
No, I'm not leaving.

01:44:01.416 --> 01:44:02.791
That's out of the question.

01:44:02.875 --> 01:44:06.208
I've had a relationship with the orchestra
for 15 years, they'll understand.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.083
No, that--

01:44:10.791 --> 01:44:13.958
I'm not leaving here, Harry.
You're gonna have to figure it out.

01:44:14.958 --> 01:44:15.958
Yes.

01:44:20.291 --> 01:44:21.500
Yes, we're doing fine.

01:45:32.708 --> 01:45:35.124
- Are you using the bathroom?
- No, I can't.

01:45:35.208 --> 01:45:37.332
- You have to drink your water.
- I'm trying.

01:45:37.416 --> 01:45:40.832
Oh, my God,
I'm freezing cold all the time.

01:45:40.916 --> 01:45:43.874
No, don't help me. I don't need help.

01:45:43.958 --> 01:45:46.374
I don't need it. I don't need it.

01:45:46.458 --> 01:45:47.541
Let go.

01:45:48.166 --> 01:45:50.666
Get into bed, come on.
I don't need all this fuss.

01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:53.750
- Are the pillows all right?
- Honestly, they're fine. Come on.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.833
- Just lie down. Lie down.
- Okay.

01:46:08.416 --> 01:46:11.666
Sorry. Sorry.

01:46:12.541 --> 01:46:13.625
I'm sorry.

01:46:16.583 --> 01:46:17.583
You know...

01:46:20.333 --> 01:46:21.541
all you need...

01:46:24.166 --> 01:46:28.166
all anyone needs
is to be sensitive to others.

01:46:30.750 --> 01:46:31.958
Kindness.

01:46:35.375 --> 01:46:38.000
Kindness. Kindness.

01:46:43.583 --> 01:46:47.000
Darling, it's ten minutes past half hour.
Did you take your medicine?

01:46:47.791 --> 01:46:50.208
- No, I don't--
- How's your pain threshold?

01:46:53.291 --> 01:46:55.125
I think he told me not to take it.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.833
- Who told you?
- Arkell.

01:46:58.625 --> 01:46:59.625
Darling...

01:47:00.250 --> 01:47:03.875
No, Arkell's not our doctor.
It's Kruger... Bernard.

01:47:04.791 --> 01:47:06.624
Arkell was our doctor many years ago.

01:47:06.708 --> 01:47:08.499
Of course, no, I don't know what...

01:47:08.583 --> 01:47:11.416
Maybe you should go take some medicine.
How's your pain?

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:12.416
It's fine.

01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:13.499
- No pain?
- No.

01:47:13.583 --> 01:47:15.708
Okay, well, after this, take it,
all right?

01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:19.874
- Darling, all right?
- No, I'm concentrating.

01:47:19.958 --> 01:47:21.166
Look what I found.

01:47:22.166 --> 01:47:23.333
What is it?

01:47:24.208 --> 01:47:26.916
- Speaking of childhood memories...
- Oh, yes.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.624
- Could be a good idea.
- More interesting.

01:47:29.708 --> 01:47:31.541
- Now, is it?
- Put it on.

01:47:33.791 --> 01:47:35.541
Do you remember that song, dear?

01:47:35.625 --> 01:47:37.041
- You do?
- Do you guys think we do?

01:47:38.291 --> 01:47:40.124
- Do you remember the dance?
- No.

01:47:40.208 --> 01:47:42.624
- You were the worst--
- Do you remember the dance?

01:47:42.708 --> 01:47:44.708
You were the absolute worst at it.

01:47:45.583 --> 01:47:48.166

Come here, everyone.

01:48:19.125 --> 01:48:20.125
Come here.

01:48:45.375 --> 01:48:49.375
Sweet Gene, come here. Come here.

01:48:50.375 --> 01:48:52.291
Come here. Sweet Gene, come here.

01:48:52.375 --> 01:48:54.000
Let's go to the house.

01:49:05.916 --> 01:49:07.541
Where's the patient?

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.833
Where is the patient?

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:13.916
The doctor is here. Hello, nurse.

01:49:14.583 --> 01:49:15.583
And, uh...

01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:50.375
I love you.

01:49:54.958 --> 01:49:56.375
You smell like...

01:49:57.541 --> 01:49:58.958
tuna fish...

01:50:00.625 --> 01:50:02.041
and cigarettes.

01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:06.958
You caught me.

01:50:09.666 --> 01:50:10.750
It's horrible.

01:53:33.958 --> 01:53:35.375
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:53:43.166 --> 01:53:44.166
Get the bag.

01:53:58.791 --> 01:54:03.458
I think the main point
of this whole piece is becoming one.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.166
Not only the timpani in the back,
but also the violins in the front.

01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:08.874
Have to treat them all as one organism.

01:54:08.958 --> 01:54:11.457
If you do that,
then you can just work from there.

01:54:11.541 --> 01:54:13.332
I've got you. So don't worry.

01:54:13.416 --> 01:54:16.041
Okay? I'm right here.
I'm gonna take you through it.

01:54:16.125 --> 01:54:17.541
- Okay? Here we go.
- Okay.

01:54:26.791 --> 01:54:28.208
William, everybody.

01:54:30.791 --> 01:54:33.416
Bar three-eleven, please.

01:54:35.041 --> 01:54:36.291
One, two, three.

01:55:08.208 --> 01:55:09.416
Okay. Sorry.

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:11.666
Sorry.

01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:13.916
Now that you've made it clear

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.833
that you're retarding into the fermata...

01:55:17.375 --> 01:55:19.041
Yeah, I'm just still unclear after--

01:55:19.125 --> 01:55:20.791
It's fine, everything's together.

01:55:20.875 --> 01:55:23.124
But what happens after?
What are you gonna do?

01:55:23.208 --> 01:55:26.291
'Cause they don't know. You gonna
bleed out of it or you gonna

01:55:26.375 --> 01:55:28.291
drip out of it? What are you gonna do?

01:55:29.333 --> 01:55:30.333
I'll do this.

01:55:30.875 --> 01:55:33.000
Leak out of it.
That's what it sounds like.

01:55:33.916 --> 01:55:34.916
Fermata.

01:55:35.791 --> 01:55:37.791
- Bar before.
- Bar before.

01:55:39.375 --> 01:55:41.875
One, two, three.

01:55:47.625 --> 01:55:49.625
No, that's not clear.

01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:52.499
Yeah, I didn't feel that.

01:55:52.583 --> 01:55:54.208
One more time please. Sorry.

01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.125
Shall I--

01:56:03.416 --> 01:56:05.416
Okay, that's very nice.

01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:07.916
But that's still a bar.

01:56:08.708 --> 01:56:11.582
So, if I could just show you
what I think you wanted

01:56:11.666 --> 01:56:13.541
- and if I'm wrong, you tell me.
- Okay.

01:56:13.625 --> 01:56:16.707
So think you want to do. Where you want
to take it... You have to do...

01:56:16.791 --> 01:56:18.416
cut off and an upbeat.

01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:21.666
Quarters. I think
that's what you really mean.

01:56:23.125 --> 01:56:24.541
Bar before the fermata.

01:56:34.708 --> 01:56:35.541
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:56:35.625 --> 01:56:37.250
Did I get it? What did I do?

01:56:37.875 --> 01:56:39.291
Ah, that's what I did.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.291
That's for me or for you?

01:56:42.375 --> 01:56:43.291
More.

01:56:44.166 --> 01:56:45.583
More. More!

01:56:47.083 --> 01:56:49.083
That's very good. Okay.

01:56:49.666 --> 01:56:52.083
Start back here. Okay, thank you.

01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:56.750
Be kind to him.

01:57:44.833 --> 01:57:47.666
<i>If summer doesn't sing in you,
then nothing sings in you,</i>

01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:50.457
<i>and if nothing sings in you,
then you can't make music.</i>

01:57:50.541 --> 01:57:51.750
Something she told me

01:57:52.458 --> 01:57:55.166
when I was gloomy about something

01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:57.832
and recited this
Edna St. Vincent Millay poem,

01:57:57.916 --> 01:57:59.541
which then became Songfest.

01:58:01.291 --> 01:58:03.291
But summer does still sing in me.

01:58:04.541 --> 01:58:06.708
Not as strongly as it used to or...

01:58:10.541 --> 01:58:11.958
or as often...

01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:14.708
but it sure does.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.333
If not, I would've jumped
in the lake long ago.

01:58:35.708 --> 01:58:36.916
Any questions?
