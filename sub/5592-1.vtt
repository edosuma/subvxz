00:20.520 --> 00:23.126
<i>Hey, this is Claire, leave
me a message and I'll call you back.</i>

00:25.120 --> 00:26.531
<i>Hey,
it's your dad.</i>

00:27.600 --> 00:30.126
<i>I know it's been a few years
since we've talked, and...</i>

00:30.600 --> 00:32.170
<i>I don't know
if you're still mad or...</i>

00:33.040 --> 00:34.485
<i>Mmm, I don't really know
anything.</i>

00:35.360 --> 00:38.728
<i>I just know... I miss you.</i>

00:40.280 --> 00:43.523
<i>I'm sure there's plenty of apologies to
go around. But to be honest with you,</i>

00:43.640 --> 00:46.405
<i>I'm not interested in who was
right or wrong anymore.</i>

00:47.960 --> 00:50.122
<i>So much has changed
since I saw you last.</i>

00:50.320 --> 00:52.527
<i>I don't know whether those
changes are good or bad, but...</i>

00:53.920 --> 00:56.810
<i>I really think it has
a chance to all work out.</i>

00:57.880 --> 01:00.565
<i>And knowing how important you've
been through all of this,</i>

01:00.640 --> 01:02.130
<i>to so many people out there,</i>

01:02.600 --> 01:03.806
<i>it's made me proud.</i>

01:05.360 --> 01:07.806
<i>And I just wanted to call
and tell you</i>

01:08.080 --> 01:10.606
<i>how excited I am that
we might be seeing each other.</i>

01:15.800 --> 01:19.122
<i>When you look back at the things you've
done, the decisions you've made...</i>

01:19.200 --> 01:20.804
Whoa!

01:21.320 --> 01:25.006
<i>The last thing
you wanna feel... Is regret.</i>

01:26.840 --> 01:28.046
<i>Am I right?</i>

01:29.760 --> 01:30.886
<i>I'll see you soon, Claire Bear.</i>

01:30.960 --> 01:32.371
On little Odessa, Texas.

01:32.480 --> 01:35.848
Headquarters of Primatech, the
global leaders of Evo research.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.448
<i>The dream for
peace between humans and Evos.</i>

02:14.600 --> 02:16.921
<i>Massive
evidence now at hand.</i>

02:17.000 --> 02:18.650
<i>Odessa, if that's...</i>

02:18.720 --> 02:20.404
<i>The once
thriving city in Central Texas.</i>

02:20.480 --> 02:21.561
<i>Why did this have to happen?</i>

02:21.960 --> 02:23.530
<i>It was a
despicable and cowardly act.</i>

02:23.600 --> 02:24.601
<i>Wasteland buyer...</i>

02:24.680 --> 02:25.841
<i>These are the seeds of hate</i>

02:25.920 --> 02:27.729
<i>that we cannot let take
root in our heart.</i>

02:27.800 --> 02:30.280
<i>These horrific
attacks are a grim reminder</i>

02:30.360 --> 02:32.044
<i>of the hatred and contempt...</i>

02:32.120 --> 02:33.281
<i>Bigotry that says another</i>

02:33.360 --> 02:35.488
<i>person is less than my equal,
less than human.</i>

02:35.560 --> 02:36.846
<i>Hospital here in Odessa...</i>

02:36.920 --> 02:38.888
<i>Listen,
I wanted to trust those Evos.</i>

02:38.960 --> 02:41.406
<i>We as a people
do not want this kind of thing</i>

02:41.480 --> 02:42.481
<i>happening in our
United States...</i>

02:42.560 --> 02:44.483
<i>We can’t
just let them get away with this!</i>

02:44.600 --> 02:45.761
<i>Who did this? And Why?</i>

02:45.840 --> 02:47.968
<i>We have
got to go attack the enemy.</i>

02:48.080 --> 02:52.051
<i>These bullies and
tyrants and terrorists with strength.</i>

02:52.440 --> 02:54.044
<i>And so we are newly reminded</i>

02:54.200 --> 02:56.806
<i>that serious threats to
our way of life remain.</i>

02:56.960 --> 02:59.008
<i>And the state. We
will get to the bottom of this.</i>

02:59.080 --> 03:00.081
Claire!

03:00.240 --> 03:03.050
<i>To bring those who
committed this vicious attack to justice.</i>

03:03.160 --> 03:04.491
<i>June 13th
will certainly go down</i>

03:04.560 --> 03:05.800
<i>in history as one of
the worst terrorist attacks.</i>

03:05.920 --> 03:07.046
<i>We'll hunt down...</i>

03:07.120 --> 03:08.326
<i>But the fact are terrorists...</i>

03:08.440 --> 03:10.363
<i>- Claire!</i>
<i>- And punish those responsible.</i>

03:10.440 --> 03:11.930
<i>Will be brought to justice.</i>

03:12.000 --> 03:13.729
<i>Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!</i>

03:13.920 --> 03:15.524
Claire!

03:34.960 --> 03:36.166
Take a look!

04:36.600 --> 04:39.410
Go, on.
Move along. In a line, please.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.963
Hero Truther says in other countries,
they shoot people like us in the streets.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.883
It's Canada, not North Korea.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.729
You'll be safe.
Canadians are nice.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.609
That's what you
said about people in Denver.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.247
What is it?

04:57.200 --> 04:58.361
They're swabbing.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.885
Hold it right there!

05:03.400 --> 05:04.526
What do we do?

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

06:01.640 --> 06:02.641
Coach Lewis?

06:02.960 --> 06:04.769
Ah, Jeez.
You gotta be kiddin' me.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.370
<i>Odessa, a once
thriving city in Central Texas,</i>

06:12.440 --> 06:14.602
<i>is reduced to
a desolate wasteland</i>

06:14.680 --> 06:16.364
<i>- by a cowardly act of Eve-terrorism.</i>
- Password?

06:16.480 --> 06:17.481
Cockroach?

06:18.200 --> 06:19.201
<i>Why Odessa?</i>

06:19.280 --> 06:23.330
<i>It was the headquarters of Primatech,
a company steeped in secrecy.</i>

06:24.320 --> 06:28.530
<i>Primatech opened its doors on June 13th
for what was to be a three day summit.</i>

06:29.200 --> 06:31.407
<i>People gathered from all around
the world, hoping to build</i>

06:31.520 --> 06:37.289
<i>a better future, where humans and
Evos could co-exist in peace.</i>

06:37.600 --> 06:41.286
<i>Within hours, an Evo-supremacist
named Mohinder Suresh claimed</i>

06:41.400 --> 06:43.368
<i>full responsibility
for the attacks.</i>

06:43.480 --> 06:45.721
Lies, all of it.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.646
This is pathetic.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.491
How the hell are we supposed to fight
back if we can't even organize?

06:52.680 --> 06:55.251
We just got to get creative. There's
a guy in Los Angeles fighting back.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.681
Calls himself "El Vengador."

06:56.800 --> 06:59.326
A dude in a Mexican wrestler costume.
That's a joke, right?

06:59.520 --> 07:00.851
Is it?
At least he's doing something.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.082
I hear he's got a whole
underground railroad out there.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.171
Fake ID’s, fake blood samples.
It's a way to disappear.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.011
One guy, so what?

07:08.360 --> 07:10.442
Pretty soon they'll send
drones after us.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.521
June 13th
changed everything.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.486
Public's scared to death of us.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.403
Most of these
incidents are isolated.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.927
Tulsa, Cedar Rapids. They're vigilantes,
a few bad apples. That's all.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.170
If it was just vigilantes, the government
wouldn't be forcing us to register.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.925
People don't get it. It's not the
government or the vigilantes

07:26.000 --> 07:27.365
we should be worried about.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.885
The ones who're really hunting us?
They're in the shadows.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.362
There's something else going on here.
And they're everywhere.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.170
Well, that's just great.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.247
So what are we supposed
to do with that? Chase ghosts?

07:43.880 --> 07:48.886
My mom sleeps with a gun under her
pillow, when she sleeps at all.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.405
And we use fake names most of the time.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.802
- I'm calling myself Tommy now.
- No names for God's sakes.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.690
Now we're wanted in three states all
because I can't control my power.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.410
I came here tonight because I thought
maybe someone could give me a few tips.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.249
Help me out a little.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.250
You came to the wrong
place, my friend.

08:17.720 --> 08:20.246
I... Uh, I gotta go.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.886
My mom.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.681
Sorry.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.610
- Hey, look out!
- Ow!

08:34.919 --> 08:37.048
- I'm so sorry.
- Come on.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.806
I'm really sorry.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.366
Argh!

09:03.800 --> 09:05.723
You can't have a revolution
without casualties.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.049
- Resistance is our only answer!
By any means possible. - Exactly.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.561
We need to stop acting like victims here.
We're the ones with powers.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.644
Suresh was right.
We are the future.

09:20.760 --> 09:21.761
"The future"?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.041
That's a good one.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.487
On June 13th, my wife and I, we
brought our 9-year-old son, Dennis,

09:28.560 --> 09:30.483
to Odessa to watch
history being made.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.122
It was a beautiful day,
sun was shinin',

09:34.200 --> 09:35.884
summer heat was risin' up
off the ground.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.364
Like everyone there, we
believed in the cause,

09:39.440 --> 09:40.965
we believed that the change

09:41.640 --> 09:44.041
could come from that spot,
right then and there.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.683
And then when I watched my...
My boy die in my arms,

09:53.480 --> 09:55.767
I realized...  That
just wasn't gonna happen.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.962
You all seem like
really nice folks.

10:02.440 --> 10:05.683
You can't change
who you are, what you are,

10:07.200 --> 10:11.125
but these powers,
they're not natural.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.088
They're not safe, and
they cannot be trusted.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.850
So as far as I'm concerned, there's
only one solution for that.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.002
And what solution is that?

10:24.080 --> 10:26.128
It's a trap! They found us.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.841
One of them got away.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.081
Dropped this.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.329
Moe's Ice Cream Parlor.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.405
Carbondale, Illinois.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.809
One more and we get
a free ice-cream.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.731
For Dennis.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.810
<i>Memories are
funny things.</i>

11:50.240 --> 11:52.208
The good ones fill your
life with meaning.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.168
With context, with clarity.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.004
While other memories
can deceive.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.528
The ones that make you believe
you know the truth,

12:03.960 --> 12:05.200
they're the dangerous ones.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.129
The ones that hold you hostage.

12:10.200 --> 12:13.090
When you look back on all the
decisions you've made in your life,

12:13.560 --> 12:15.767
the one thing you
don't wanna feel

12:17.600 --> 12:18.647
is regret.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.121
Am I right?

12:23.720 --> 12:25.210
That's why this car makes
so much sense.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.681
Gas mileage, style, safety.
It's got it all.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.522
Not to mention that new-car smell.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.928
What do you think, young lady?

12:33.280 --> 12:34.805
Okay.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.920
<i>Leasing
office, pick up line three.</i>

12:43.000 --> 12:44.923
<i>Leasing office, line three.</i>

12:48.880 --> 12:51.326
So, should I get started
on the paperwork?

12:51.920 --> 12:54.685
I'd like to check the safety
stats on the car first.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.089
You've probably got kids,
right, Mr. Barnes?

13:04.080 --> 13:06.082
- Linda, you're amazing.
- Oh, it's Lisa.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.281
Oh, Lisa, yeah, right.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.288
- We gotta stop.
- What... Why? What's wrong?

13:12.360 --> 13:13.805
Oh, lunchtime.
You're on in five.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.644
<i>All I know about
being a hero is,</i>

13:19.720 --> 13:21.563
<i>it's not something
you're born with.</i>

13:21.720 --> 13:23.722
And if you had told me
when I was your age

13:23.800 --> 13:26.201
that I'd be getting
a medal of valor

13:26.360 --> 13:29.489
for saving three soldiers
from an ambush in Afghanistan,

13:29.760 --> 13:30.886
I'd have said you were nuts.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.521
But...

13:33.360 --> 13:34.361
Here I am.

13:34.840 --> 13:38.208
I'd like to thank Principal
Marks and Miss, Miss, uh...

13:39.160 --> 13:40.161
Carpenter.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.369
Right. Uh, for giving me such a...
A warm welcome today.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.610
I'll leave you with
this last thought.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.404
It doesn't matter how ordinary
you think you are

13:50.400 --> 13:53.768
or how much of a screw up
you think you've been,

13:54.040 --> 13:56.281
we all have the potential
to be heroes.

13:58.840 --> 13:59.841
Thank you.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.850
- Do you want it?
- Yeah.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.564
Hey, Brad!

14:26.440 --> 14:27.851
Yeah. Who knows?

14:28.120 --> 14:29.884
So they, like, customize it?

14:31.080 --> 14:33.003
Yeah,
but you have to order... Hey!

14:34.000 --> 14:35.445
You like my girlfriend?
What?

14:35.560 --> 14:37.961
- You're staring at my girlfriend.
- No, I wasn't staring at...

14:45.080 --> 14:47.367
Wuss.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.805
They said his wife didn't
even know he was in Chicago.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.281
Did something happen?

15:05.320 --> 15:08.847
Coach Lewis died in a fire last
night with six other people.

15:19.280 --> 15:22.443
I've been here an hour now.
The other guy told me to wait.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.531
Mmm. Waiting.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.807
Too many people go through life
waiting for things to happen

15:31.200 --> 15:33.202
instead of making them happen.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.041
Ah.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.761
Now...

15:42.640 --> 15:44.881
Let's talk about what you saw.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.808
I'm riding my bike down
H Street with my delivery

15:47.880 --> 15:49.803
when this little prick
runs right into me.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.724
$28 worth of food on the ground.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.845
He came runnin' out of that church,
right before it caught fire,

15:55.120 --> 15:56.724
so I'm guessing he killed
all those people.

15:57.440 --> 16:01.570
Could you identify this
"prick" if you saw him again?

16:01.960 --> 16:03.086
Is there a reward?

16:22.800 --> 16:23.926
Go ahead.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.491
I don't understand.
What's this for?

16:33.600 --> 16:34.931
Penny for your thoughts.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.608
All right, so let's see if we can get
a description of that kid you saw.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.441
Kid?

16:54.200 --> 16:55.804
Sorry, I don't remember
anything about a kid.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.127
Excuse me, Miss, can I help you?

17:05.440 --> 17:06.601
That depends.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.530
Okay, now for your
favorite subject.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.122
This week, if we
knock off the cake tasting,

17:22.200 --> 17:24.042
the band audition
and the gift registration,

17:24.119 --> 17:25.884
we are way ahead of schedule.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.643
And I've got my heart
set on red velvet.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.129
I know you're a coconut man...

17:35.120 --> 17:36.690
Who doesn't love red velvet?

17:37.560 --> 17:40.769
And for the registry, I thought
we should start with the china.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.805
I think I just wanna
go white. All white.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.648
Yeah, white...
White's good. I like white.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.803
Tell me the truth, Ted.
Are you just humoring me?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.001
Why would I lie to you?

20:17.960 --> 20:20.691
Hey. You're the ice
cream junkie, right?

20:21.240 --> 20:23.561
- What?
- Well, you're at Moe's all the time.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.371
Oh.  Uh, yeah, I
guess I like ice cream.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.482
So it's not because of me.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.163
I'm just messing with you.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.129
I'm the one who drew the happy
face on your punch card.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.811
On, I know.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.606
Hey, uh, we need a new scooper.
You should come in.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.645
They're letting me do the interviews.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.683
Okay. Yeah. Maybe.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.370
Um, hey, I heard
about what Brad did to you.

20:51.320 --> 20:52.321
I'm sorry.

20:54.160 --> 20:57.369
Brad acts like a tough guy, but he's not.
He's just...

20:57.480 --> 20:59.608
A total narcissistic jerk?

20:59.680 --> 21:01.682
Sometimes, yeah.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.924
Hey, did you hear what they're
saying about Coach Lewis?

21:05.640 --> 21:06.721
That he might have been an Evo?

21:08.400 --> 21:10.368
Uh, an... "An Evo"?

21:11.080 --> 21:13.321
Evolved. Had powers.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.481
Really?

21:15.800 --> 21:18.644
Well...  I gotta get
to a French club meeting.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.049
But seriously, you should
come in for that job.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.526
- Brad.
- Hey!

21:29.200 --> 21:30.201
- Hey!
- What time are you coming over?

21:31.800 --> 21:32.801
I've got
French club so...

21:32.880 --> 21:34.120
- Want me to pick you up?
- Sure.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.564
<i>Come on,
hurry up. Let's go.</i>

21:44.360 --> 21:46.203
Why don't you ever stay with
us when you're in town?

21:47.560 --> 21:48.846
Uh, it's complicated.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.690
If you came back, you
could work at the shop.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.648
I don't know. I think your
dad's still pretty sore at me.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.522
He's probably over it
now that you're a hero.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.641
Hero.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.248
But... You're like
El Vengador.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.370
What, the guy in
the Mexican wrestling mask?

22:09.920 --> 22:11.046
Are you comparing me to an Evo?

22:11.280 --> 22:14.762
They say anyone can turn out to be an Evo.
You're just born that way.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.809
There's this website
called Hero Truther,

22:21.880 --> 22:24.486
and they're tracking how all these
Evos are starting to disappear.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.285
Someone's taking them,
maybe even killing them.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.842
El Vengador's the only one taking
care of this neighborhood.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.769
The only one the
gangbangers are scared of.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.283
- All right.
- I've heard enough about El Vengador.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.284
I've seen enough, too.
Is that yours, Jose?

22:40.960 --> 22:41.961
Yes.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.851
Yes. But people need to know he's not
in hiding like the rest of them.

22:44.920 --> 22:48.527
No, people need to come to a garage without
graffiti on the wall. Now clean it up.

22:53.480 --> 22:56.006
So the kid's got a hero, someone
to look up to. What's the problem?

22:56.360 --> 22:59.648
El Vengador isn't everybody's hero.
The tag is bad for business.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.601
And what's Jose need a caped crusader
to idolize when he's got Tio Carlos.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.485
Hey, Oscar!

23:06.640 --> 23:09.803
I think she's a lost cause.
Transmission's shot.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.761
- I don't know, you hear that?
- What?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.482
I can hear an air leak. Just
need to replace the vacuum line,

23:16.560 --> 23:17.561
modulator valve,

23:17.640 --> 23:18.801
she should be good to go.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.644
Hey, I told Pop to paint the "S"
off the word "sons" years ago.

23:24.640 --> 23:28.122
Yeah, he figured after you came back
from the army, you'd change your mind.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.571
Look, war hero or not,
you broke his heart.

23:33.880 --> 23:34.881
Hope you know that.

23:43.320 --> 23:46.688
- Like it was ever gonna be 50/50, anyway.
- Oh, that's it!

23:47.600 --> 23:50.046
Walk away! You're real good
at that, "Hero-man."

23:50.160 --> 23:51.525
See you later, okay?

23:58.200 --> 24:00.726
I don't know, if this thing
gets to be over 75 people,

24:01.040 --> 24:02.326
we might need to rent a tent.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.605
Sure it's not too late to elope?

24:06.640 --> 24:09.803
Sorry. You've been roped
and tied, my friend.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.171
Can you hold that thought?

24:21.040 --> 24:22.724
- What?
- I'll be right back.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.001
What is it?

24:51.560 --> 24:54.530
First rule of tailing somebody?
Know how to tail someone.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.887
- Who are you, what do you want?
- Answers.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.401
Answers to what?

24:58.680 --> 25:00.682
To what really happened
on June 13th.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.364
The hell does that have
to do with me?

25:02.760 --> 25:03.921
You're Noah Bennet, right?

25:04.160 --> 25:06.049
Who do you work for?

25:06.840 --> 25:07.887
- Renautas.
- Renautas?

25:07.960 --> 25:11.521
I worked at
Renautas but not for Renautas.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.523
And I know that you worked
for Primatech.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.404
I sold paper.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.126
Sure. Along with bagging
and tagging

25:25.400 --> 25:26.561
and keeping powers under wraps.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.926
And you know this, how?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.048
Because Renautas secretly
owned Primatech.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.361
Primatech is dead. It's
a hole in the ground.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.329
Unless it's not. That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

25:34.520 --> 25:38.286
June 13th is just the beginning. I just...
I don't know of what.

25:38.640 --> 25:42.804
And your name is on hundreds of
memos and shredded documents.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.805
You know something about June
13th that nobody else does.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.962
Let me guess, you're a Truther.

25:48.440 --> 25:52.161
- An apologist for Mohinder Suresh?
- And... What do you...

25:52.240 --> 25:56.484
Suresh had nothing to do with Odessa.
He's a patsy.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.968
How do you not know that, man?
What did they do to you?

26:00.560 --> 26:03.211
Get a life. Stay out of mine.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.727
Wait, I have the manuscript.
Suresh was just about to publish.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.723
- And how the hell do you have that?
- It's all in here.

26:09.960 --> 26:13.043
How the number of Evos is higher
on the planet than ever before.

26:14.240 --> 26:18.006
These powers, their numbers
are increasing. Escalating!

26:18.320 --> 26:20.402
Why?
Is it evolutionary?

26:20.480 --> 26:22.403
Is it because they wanna
take over, like the media,

26:22.480 --> 26:24.642
like the government,
like, wants us to think?

26:25.040 --> 26:28.089
No. They're here to save us.
"Save us"?

26:28.160 --> 26:30.288
From whatever it is
that Renautas is planning.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.562
If that's true, then
where are they, huh?

26:32.760 --> 26:36.003
Do you see any people with powers
around here? They are all gone!

26:36.360 --> 26:38.089
They are hiding or dead.

26:38.840 --> 26:42.003
Believe me. If they were here to save
us, I would know.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.406
Listen to me, man.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.969
Oh! You called the cops?

26:48.040 --> 26:50.042
That's him! That's the guy.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.050
- On the ground, hands above your head!
- Oh! You got... Man!

26:53.440 --> 26:54.885
I said down. Now!

26:56.400 --> 26:59.370
June 13th did not happen
like they say it did.

26:59.520 --> 27:03.047
Listen to me. I have been over
that day a thousand times.

27:03.320 --> 27:06.642
My daughter died on that day. You
don’t just forget a day like that.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.728
You do if someone doesn't
want you to remember it.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.689
- Come on. Let's go. - That's what
I'm trying to tell you, man.

27:10.800 --> 27:11.961
- Come on.
- Somethin' big's comin'.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.201
- Something big's comin'.
- Calm down.

27:13.360 --> 27:16.011
- How do you not know that, man?
- Come on, sir, move.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.926
Are you okay?

27:18.440 --> 27:21.091
Yeah, he's...
He's just some nut.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.965
Come on, let's go inside.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.491
Ophthalmology.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.328
"Relocated from
Odessa to Dallas."

30:14.840 --> 30:16.649
<i>He killed a lot
of people in Odessa last year.</i>

30:16.720 --> 30:19.724
<i>We all know that. But all
I know is, he saved me.</i>

30:20.720 --> 30:23.564
<i>Powers or not,
the guy's a hero in my books.</i>

30:24.240 --> 30:27.369
<i>Although many
believe El Vengador is in fact an Evo,</i>

30:28.040 --> 30:31.249
<i>authorities are still debating
whether or not he's broken any laws.</i>

31:08.440 --> 31:09.487
Argh!

31:57.680 --> 31:58.681
Oscar?

32:28.680 --> 32:29.841
I don't understand.

32:33.080 --> 32:34.730
You're El Vengador?

32:36.520 --> 32:41.481
Since June 13th,
all the world's gone crazy.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.491
I'm just trying to
make a difference.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.690
So you're telling me
you have powers?

32:54.240 --> 32:55.571
We all have our secrets.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.848
Tell me what's going on?
What happened?

33:01.440 --> 33:02.646
Oh, my God!

33:02.760 --> 33:05.923
- It was a trap. They knew I was coming.
- Who?

33:06.360 --> 33:07.930
- Who?
- It's all there.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.811
Carlos, listen to me.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.044
Jose really looks up to you.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.650
He's gonna need
a strong hand, you gotta...

33:20.760 --> 33:23.331
No. What are you even talking about?
Hey, we're gonna get you an ambulance.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.209
It's not just Jose.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.444
There's others.
What others?

33:28.160 --> 33:29.844
Someone like you.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.765
You can put on the mask.

33:33.960 --> 33:34.961
You're a hero.

33:37.760 --> 33:41.606
I'm not. Everything they say
about me, the medal, all...

33:43.280 --> 33:46.011
No...

33:50.360 --> 33:51.361
No...

34:10.480 --> 34:11.481
You all right?

34:14.960 --> 34:17.007
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's just, um,

34:17.280 --> 34:18.804
I mean, you know, this kid
that we're looking for.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.041
I mean...
There's a good chance

34:20.159 --> 34:21.446
he didn't even notice me
the other night.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.362
And I really think we should
be focusing our efforts

34:23.440 --> 34:24.726
on finding this El Vengador guy.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.165
The kid has powers, full stop.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.085
We're gonna finish
what we came here to do.

34:28.159 --> 34:31.447
And then we can go to Los Angeles, see
if we can find your Mexican wrestler.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.081
Okay?

34:35.159 --> 34:36.366
This really is unbelievable.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.525
We do all the hard work and this son of
bitch terrorist gets all the credit.

34:43.199 --> 34:44.326
That's the second time now.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.208
I mean once, that's
a coincidence, but not twice.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.449
I might die of boredom here.

34:52.360 --> 34:54.010
- I need to pee.
- Have fun.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.685
You've really moved
around a lot.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.211
What are you, like,
from some weird nomadic tribe?

35:03.760 --> 35:07.560
Uh, I am, as a matter of fact.
Is that a problem? -

35:08.760 --> 35:12.685
Okay. Let's start this
interview for real.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.483
Can you scoop ice cream?

35:16.680 --> 35:18.364
Uh, yeah?

35:20.040 --> 35:23.169
- Congratulations. You're hired!
- Wow! Uh...

35:23.760 --> 35:25.444
All right. Thanks so much.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.405
My mom's going to
be really excited.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.166
Well, I will get your uniform,
and you can start tomorrow.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.928
Okay, so I've got three sizes. And
you can try them in the men's room.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.001
Okay. Sure.

35:40.880 --> 35:44.248
I... Give me a second.
I'll be right back.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.322
I can't believe you
made it out alive.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.041
So what happened in there?

35:58.640 --> 36:00.244
All I heard is
the place burned down.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.481
What do you think happened?

36:07.640 --> 36:10.484
I think we shouldn't
talk about it in public.

36:10.640 --> 36:11.846
Good idea.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.965
Hey, you forgot to try
on your uniforms.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.289
Well, it looks like both of you
are going for a little ride.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.964
No need. We'll take
'em both now.

37:03.880 --> 37:04.881
Hey!

37:06.200 --> 37:08.168
Where are you going?
Where do you think?

37:08.960 --> 37:11.406
Home. To pack and leave,
like we always do.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.523
I am such an idiot, thinking
I could have a normal life here.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.081
I'm just...

37:20.720 --> 37:21.767
I'm sorry.

37:23.120 --> 37:24.884
Those people.
Where did they go?

37:25.280 --> 37:27.886
I don't know. I don't know
where any of it goes.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.011
How's that for
the worst power ever?

37:30.800 --> 37:32.131
You saved my life.

37:36.640 --> 37:37.641
Tommy!

37:39.880 --> 37:40.881
Tommy!

37:43.160 --> 37:44.286
Your secret...

37:46.680 --> 37:48.364
It's safe with me.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.249
Why didn't El Vengador
stop them?

38:11.720 --> 38:12.926
Maybe he tried.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.851
What good is a hero if he doesn't
help people who need him most?

38:18.120 --> 38:19.121
You would've.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.851
Look, I hope you know
I'm always here for you.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.164
I never even got
a chance to tell him.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.087
To show him.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.121
Show him what?

38:37.560 --> 38:38.925
I... I kind of want
to be alone.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.081
I'm sorry, Jose.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.683
- Can I help you?
- Yes, um...

39:48.720 --> 39:49.881
I have an odd question.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.440
Have I ever been here before?

39:54.640 --> 39:55.926
I don't believe so. No.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.210
Do you mind checking
your records?

40:00.240 --> 40:02.561
The name is Ted... Bennet.

40:03.920 --> 40:04.921
Noah Bennet.

40:18.920 --> 40:21.127
I'm sorry, there's nothing
here under Bennet.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.488
Perhaps if you remembered
the doctor's name?

40:25.680 --> 40:28.524
Yeah, you
know, I wish I did. I...

40:30.920 --> 40:32.046
"See more clearly."

40:33.200 --> 40:36.044
Sorry. We have no doctor
here named Seymour.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.523
No.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.690
No. That's just what's
written on the card.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.882
You know, I really think
I have been here before.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.922
I knew there was something
off about this place.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.882
It's okay. He's a friend.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.081
Rene?

41:13.800 --> 41:16.371
There's a bench across
the street. Wait for me there.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.445
You left these
the last time I saw you.

44:03.400 --> 44:04.401
Didn't know what I was missing.

44:27.160 --> 44:28.764
Rene, what the...

44:43.040 --> 44:44.485
Oh, my God.

44:44.840 --> 44:46.251
No.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.130
No, Rene.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.203
Why were you trying to kill me?

44:52.000 --> 44:53.365
You told me to.

44:53.560 --> 44:54.766
What?

44:55.760 --> 44:57.410
You made the perfect plan.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.480
You wiped my memory.

45:00.600 --> 45:01.931
You needed to forget.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.367
What did I need
to forget? What?

45:06.200 --> 45:07.440
It's coming.

45:09.720 --> 45:11.131
It's coming.

45:11.960 --> 45:14.247
No, Rene.
Rene, no, no!

45:14.560 --> 45:16.688
What did I need to
forget? What is it?

45:18.600 --> 45:20.011
Rene!

45:42.920 --> 45:44.649
<i>Where does it
come from,</i>

45:46.160 --> 45:47.571
<i>this fear,</i>

45:48.400 --> 45:50.004
<i>this quest...</i>

45:52.440 --> 45:55.762
<i>This need to hide
in a simpler past</i>

45:56.720 --> 45:59.166
<i>when the future
cannot be avoided?</i>

46:02.440 --> 46:04.010
<i>It's coming.</i>

46:06.240 --> 46:07.810
<i>And when it does...</i>

46:10.240 --> 46:11.685
<i>Everything will change.</i>

46:14.360 --> 46:16.362
<i>Yet there are those
who can stop it...</i>

46:19.040 --> 46:20.644
<i>Do we know how?</i>

46:22.640 --> 46:24.404
It's happening faster
than we thought.

46:24.960 --> 46:26.883
I don't think
I can control it much longer.

46:59.760 --> 47:01.524
- It's coming.
<i>- Rene!</i>

47:02.320 --> 47:03.970
<i>What did I need to forget?</i>

47:04.400 --> 47:05.686
You wiped my memory.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.241
No!

47:09.760 --> 47:11.444
Rene! Rene!

47:11.880 --> 47:14.281
<i>What did I need to
forget? What is it?</i>

47:21.760 --> 47:23.250
Hey

47:23.360 --> 47:25.567
- Come on, let's go!
- Whoo!

47:26.120 --> 47:27.451
<i>Hey</i>

47:30.000 --> 47:31.365
<i>Hey</i>

47:33.760 --> 47:37.207
<i>You going to the party
on Saturday</i>

47:37.280 --> 47:40.124
<i>She asked us and I didn't know</i>

47:42.280 --> 47:44.442
<i>High school love</i>

47:45.960 --> 47:47.564
Pretty sure
whatever I touch

47:47.680 --> 47:48.841
just like, ceases to exist.

47:49.400 --> 47:51.129
I think you're being
a tad melodramatic.

47:52.640 --> 47:55.291
Seriously, we should be able to
figure out how your power works.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.448
You don't understand how
dangerous having a power is.

47:59.480 --> 48:01.642
It's like being a witch
in Salem.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.485
People hate us.

48:04.200 --> 48:05.531
They want us dead.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.131
How long have you had it?

48:08.320 --> 48:10.004
Ever since I was a kid.

48:11.880 --> 48:13.405
When I was, like, seven,

48:13.880 --> 48:16.406
these people took me to this
place because of my power.

48:18.240 --> 48:21.449
I remember a room
filled with toys and stuff.

48:22.160 --> 48:23.571
No windows.

48:24.400 --> 48:25.890
It was kind of hazy.

48:26.960 --> 48:28.564
I think about it all the time.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.525
Especially when I'm scared.

48:31.040 --> 48:33.930
Not like I run around
all day terrified or anything.

48:36.160 --> 48:37.810
Will you make this disappear?

48:38.360 --> 48:40.044
I want to know
what it feels like.

48:51.480 --> 48:53.244
So cool.

48:57.320 --> 48:58.845
Where the hell have you been?

48:59.040 --> 49:01.361
- I'm not exactly prison material.
- Shut up.

49:01.640 --> 49:04.166
Sorry. Thank you
for bailing me out.

49:05.360 --> 49:07.010
Why did you bail me out?

49:07.400 --> 49:09.004
I went to see a friend.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.044
To vet my memory and your claims

49:11.120 --> 49:12.963
about Renautas and June 13th.

49:13.320 --> 49:16.085
His place was a front
for some kind of an operation.

49:16.880 --> 49:18.405
And then...

49:19.160 --> 49:20.491
He tried to kill me.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.603
Kill you?
What did you do?

49:27.760 --> 49:30.411
Apparently what I forgot
what worth dying to protect.

49:31.080 --> 49:33.128
When I went back,
the place was cleaned out.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.001
So now you are going to tell
me everything you know.

49:36.680 --> 49:38.569
Or what?
You'll kill me, too?

49:48.040 --> 49:50.361
You okay?
You look worried.

49:50.480 --> 49:52.881
Worried
is kind of my default status.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.485
For obvious reasons.

49:55.080 --> 49:56.764
I told you.
You can trust me.

49:58.760 --> 50:01.161
Crap, I have trig.
See you at lunch?

50:06.920 --> 50:08.445
Hey, freak.

50:08.760 --> 50:10.364
I saw what you did in the shed.

50:10.680 --> 50:13.286
Yeah, that's right.
And I'm gonna turn you in.

50:18.600 --> 50:20.284
Maybe that's not
such a brilliant idea.

50:20.360 --> 50:21.885
I'm trying to get us
out of here.

50:21.960 --> 50:23.200
Yeah, well,
your itchy trigger fingers

50:23.280 --> 50:24.361
aren't going to do the job.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.681
Well, that is one superior
brand of drywall.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.444
Just our bloody luck.

50:33.880 --> 50:36.121
Kid was a teleporter.
Where the hell are we?

50:36.200 --> 50:38.328
I don't know.
Just keep a grip on it, okay?

50:50.800 --> 50:52.245
Dennis had one of these.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.005
God, he loved it.

51:05.200 --> 51:06.725
Maybe we're in hell.

51:08.280 --> 51:09.805
Is that where you
think we belong?

51:12.840 --> 51:14.251
If we would have let that kid go

51:14.320 --> 51:15.765
and focused on this El Vengador,

51:15.840 --> 51:17.649
we wouldn't be in this
predicament now, would we?

51:17.880 --> 51:20.690
My drive,
my itchy trigger fingers,

51:20.760 --> 51:21.841
they keep us going.

51:21.920 --> 51:23.410
None of this
would have happened

51:23.480 --> 51:25.323
if you hadn't convinced me
to take Dennis...

51:25.480 --> 51:26.606
Why don't you sit your ass down

51:26.680 --> 51:28.170
on those itchy trigger
fingers of yours,

51:28.800 --> 51:30.564
and let me use my brain
to get us out of here.

51:30.640 --> 51:32.085
How's that sound, darling?

54:02.200 --> 54:03.531
Have you thought this through?

54:03.600 --> 54:05.250
Because you know
I could make you disappear.

54:06.600 --> 54:08.011
I don't want to.

54:08.440 --> 54:09.965
All I want is to be left alone.

54:10.360 --> 54:12.089
I would never hurt anyone.

54:12.320 --> 54:13.970
I just want to live my life
like any other...

54:14.040 --> 54:15.326
And how do I know
you're not a radical?

54:15.400 --> 54:16.765
Part of that Suresh guy's group?

54:16.840 --> 54:18.046
This is crazy!

54:18.240 --> 54:19.969
You kicked my ass
yesterday at school.

54:20.040 --> 54:21.565
I could have sent you anywhere.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.571
I didn't.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.165
I'm a pacifist.

54:25.440 --> 54:26.885
Whatever that is.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.806
Okay.

54:30.880 --> 54:32.211
Maybe you do something for me,

54:32.320 --> 54:33.765
and I'll keep my mouth shut.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.411
Yeah. Anything.

54:39.080 --> 54:40.286
What?

54:40.360 --> 54:41.600
Get in.

55:05.440 --> 55:06.885
You okay, Jose?

55:08.960 --> 55:10.200
Yeah.

55:10.720 --> 55:12.245
I guess it was a good funeral.

55:12.680 --> 55:13.966
A lot of people came.

55:14.480 --> 55:16.244
'Cause your dad was a good man.

55:16.600 --> 55:17.806
You hold on to that.

55:18.280 --> 55:21.966
Jose, your mother wants you
to come back to the apartment.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.490
Carlos, may I speak with you?

55:33.680 --> 55:35.921
- Yeah, I should really just...
- It'll only take a moment.

55:37.360 --> 55:39.931
Oscar told me about
the rift between you two.

55:40.440 --> 55:42.522
I hope you had
a chance to reconcile.

55:43.080 --> 55:45.242
I don't know.
Maybe we did.

55:46.480 --> 55:47.970
He loved you.

55:48.240 --> 55:49.765
Had high hopes for you.

55:50.520 --> 55:51.885
And I disappointed him.

55:52.200 --> 55:53.770
Abandoned the family, yeah?

55:54.880 --> 55:57.929
Look, my grandfather ran
around in a luchador costume.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.771
He was a clown.

56:00.880 --> 56:03.201
And maybe I wanted to be
known for something else.

56:03.960 --> 56:06.008
We all wear masks, Carlos.

56:06.440 --> 56:08.522
What matters is
what's underneath.

56:09.960 --> 56:12.088
- Maybe you come see me...
- Yeah, I'm doing okay.

56:15.960 --> 56:18.327
Oscar died because he
stood up for the underdog.

56:19.560 --> 56:21.130
Never forget that.

56:23.680 --> 56:25.489
I'll keep that in mind.

56:29.320 --> 56:30.845
<i>When I started</i>
The Biggest Loser,

56:30.920 --> 56:34.606
<i>I weighed 242 pounds,
and today I'm at 177.</i>

56:34.880 --> 56:36.291
<i>That is 65...</i>

56:36.400 --> 56:38.164
Damn remote needs batteries.

56:39.600 --> 56:41.204
Uh, I don't understand.

56:41.360 --> 56:42.805
What am I doing?

56:44.720 --> 56:46.563
You're gonna make
my stepfather disappear.

56:46.640 --> 56:48.165
What? Why?

56:48.440 --> 56:49.930
'Cause he wants you
to buy batteries for him?

56:50.000 --> 56:51.843
No, because he's
a freaking monster.

56:52.440 --> 56:54.204
At least
you have a father.

56:54.320 --> 56:56.004
I don't even know who mine is.

56:56.640 --> 56:57.721
I'd do anything to meet him.

56:57.800 --> 56:59.325
Whoever he is,
I doubt he'd do this.

57:02.480 --> 57:05.529
I'm sorry.
That's... That's awful.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.923
I don't know
what happens when I...

57:08.320 --> 57:09.765
He could fall into a volcano.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.330
The more painful, the better.

57:11.680 --> 57:13.205
Please don't make me do this.

57:13.280 --> 57:15.362
Look, this guy sits on his
ass all day and drinks.

57:15.840 --> 57:18.161
My mom works two jobs
and he beats her, too.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.651
I'm sorry.
I, I really am, but...

57:21.760 --> 57:23.603
What the hell
you still doing here?

57:23.840 --> 57:25.365
You don't want to poke the bear.

57:26.160 --> 57:27.889
He better be gone
when I get back.

57:28.640 --> 57:30.802
I'll get the batteries, Pops.
Tommy's gonna hang.

57:32.840 --> 57:34.888
<i>My family would
always ask me to go do...</i>

57:58.400 --> 58:00.164
What the hell are you doing?

58:01.560 --> 58:03.085
Uh, uh...

58:24.080 --> 58:26.924
I got hired at
Renautas to scan and digitize

58:27.040 --> 58:28.644
any files concerning Primatech.

58:28.760 --> 58:31.684
Everything was fine until
I started reading the files.

58:31.760 --> 58:34.331
Seemed ironic some tech giant
like Renautas, like,

58:34.440 --> 58:37.125
buy into some tiny paper
company like Primatech.

58:37.280 --> 58:38.805
Why'd you stop working
at Primatech?

58:38.880 --> 58:40.450
Was it because
Renautas bought the company?

58:40.520 --> 58:43.091
No. I left after
the summit. After...

58:44.040 --> 58:46.008
That's right.
Your daughter, uh, I'm sorry.

58:46.120 --> 58:48.122
I was there June 13th.
How did I survive?

58:48.440 --> 58:49.646
I thought that I didn't remember

58:49.720 --> 58:51.961
because of the trauma
of the explosion, but...

58:54.800 --> 58:56.370
Claire was there, too.

58:57.360 --> 58:59.124
And I didn't save her.

58:59.440 --> 59:00.930
And I have to know why.

59:01.440 --> 59:03.886
No, I'm pretty sure Renautas was
behind the whole slaughter.

59:03.960 --> 59:05.200
That's not what
the world believes.

59:05.280 --> 59:06.520
You knew Mohinder Suresh.

59:06.600 --> 59:08.489
Was he capable of mass murder?

59:08.560 --> 59:10.449
No. But why is he running?

59:11.000 --> 59:13.480
Why is Renautas framing,
disappearing,

59:13.560 --> 59:15.005
and killing evolved humans?

59:15.080 --> 59:16.684
That's why I came to find you.

59:16.760 --> 59:18.728
I figured if anybody
had answers, it was you.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.804
Do you?

59:22.160 --> 59:23.286
What?

59:23.360 --> 59:24.805
Odessa.

59:24.920 --> 59:26.524
I need my files
so I can track down

59:26.600 --> 59:27.806
an Evo named Molly Walker.

59:27.880 --> 59:30.247
She can locate anyone
just by thinking about them.

59:30.800 --> 59:33.406
They built a whole system
around her 10 years ago.

59:33.480 --> 59:35.209
I've gotta get to her
before they do.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.326
Miko!

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.246
Miko!

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.481
Winner!

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.928
<i>This is where
the wild things are</i>

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.251
<i>This is
where the wild things are</i>

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.444
Why don't you give those
a little wind for me, honey?

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.721
Winner. Boom.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.970
You're incredible.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.485
All right, let's go again.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.285
Are you always
this lucky?

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.129
Only since I laid eyes on you.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.290
You must be my good luck charm.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.484
Seven!

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.006
Uh, you know what?

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.525
We are attracting
the wrong kind of attention.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.204
Why don't we take this
party somewhere else?

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.807
I'll cash out, we can grab
a drink back at my hotel.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.485
Love to.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.566
Not interested.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.846
I'm watching <i>The Biggest Loser.</i>

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.368
Ah, <i>schadenfreude.</i>
I understand the attraction.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.770
I'm here to discuss
an opportunity

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.128
that I think you will find
pretty darned attractive.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.488
What do you say you invite me
in and crack us each a tallboy?

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.371
"The Evo vigilante,
El Vengador,

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.442
"killed three police officers.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.727
"There was an anonymous report
of a women being ra... Raped.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.963
"Patrolman Eugene Pakowski
identified the assailant."

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.085
Eugene Pakowski.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.730
Let's have another drink.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.089
Now that is a good idea, Zoe.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.365
To my good luck charm.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.966
Luck.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.642
We both know your run tonight
had nothing to do with luck.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.211
What are you talking about?

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.482
You were
either cheating,

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.005
or you have powers.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.329
You don't seem smart enough
to have a system.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.644
I work for the Dragon Lounge.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.764
Ah, come on, I beat the
house, that means I'm an Evo?

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.529
I just needed to make
some fast dough.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.368
Look, I swear this will
never happen again.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.561
You turn me over and those
club goons will kill me.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.681
Or worse.

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.205
Then give me the money
and hit the road.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.280
It's your only play.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.806
Or not.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.970
Send security to 601!
A man just attacked a woman!

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.768
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.082
- Let's go.
- Who the hell are you?

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.127
A good Samaritan.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.326
Trust me,
you don't want to be here.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.401
My money's in there.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.245
I saw you in the Dragon Lounge,

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.606
and so I'm betting
the money is his,

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.921
and you don't look like someone
who wants to deal with oops.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.570
Come on.
We'll get a drink.

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.090
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.321
Wait a second, wait a second,
wait a second.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.243
I didn't hear anything
about toxins.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.810
All right, did they
discover that the site

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.609
was contaminated
after the cleanup?

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.524
Because now this all seems
like a terrible idea.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.331
I think it's a scarecrow
to keep people out.

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:21.401
You think?

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.009
Shouldn't we be certain where
deadly toxins are concerned?

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.720
Oh, Jesus.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.330
Am I turning green?

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.122
Am I turning green, man?

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.680
Man.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.122
It's so weird
to be back in Odessa.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.968
Must be way weirder for you.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.962
Your old job looking like this.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.691
- All your memories.
- Yep. Weird.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.171
They would have fixed this up

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.401
if things were still
going on, right?

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:14.086
Nope.
That'd be just like 'em.

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:16.560
Level five is where
things happened.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.041
Oh, no!

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.600
Jesus.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.241
What the hell
are we looking for?

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:37.765
I'll tell you when I find it.

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:42.441
Whoa.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.329
Who the hell are you,
James Bond?

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.563
See if you can flag anything
with Molly Walker or Renautas.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.681
This would be the jackpot
if they found this.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.681
Names, addresses, contacts...

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.250
All with powers.

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.564
You said your daughter
died here at the summit.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.801
That's right.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.647
You might need to rethink that.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.367
I don't remember this.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.567
I remember arriving
the morning of June 13th.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.884
And after that...

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.162
I just knew what the rest
of the world knew.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.844
And I just assumed Claire had
died here like everybody else.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.847
And if she didn't die here,
then where did she die?

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.726
And how did she die?

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.325
And why didn't you know?

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.647
Are they doing
something else with the Evos?

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.684
Well, if you can't tell me,
who's going to tell me?

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.689
What? What?

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:11.001
Why are you so
interested in her?

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.610
In me? Huh?

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.920
Little twerp like you
should be holed up

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.520
in your mother's basement
trolling conspiracy boards.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.601
I was just trying to help.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.409
Something terrible's
gonna happen.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.571
My sister.

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.207
They took my sister
and I couldn't stop them.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.246
Phoebe Frady.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.009
I'm just trying to find her.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.164
Is this about revenge?

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.530
Did you think I did it?

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.491
Was it you?

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.322
Her power was umbrakinesis.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.562
She could manipulate darkness.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.407
No.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.731
She wasn't one of mine.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.168
And I'm sorry you lost her.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.569
I have reason to believe

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.167
that Phoebe did not die on June
13th with the rest of them.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.848
The things that
I've found, they, uh...

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.160
They don't add up.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.369
Claire and I had a fight

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.411
right after she

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.726
came out.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.886
I haven't spoken to her
in over four years.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.566
I wanted to make things right.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.449
I would have done
anything to save her.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.562
Maybe there's
no answer for me here,

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.930
but I'd be happy
to help you find out

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.604
what happened to your daughter.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.965
It's the least I can do.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.643
We gotta be honest
with each other.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:01.564
No more secrets.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.290
No more omissions.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.606
Deal?

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.520
What happens when we've killed
every last one of them?

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.761
I don't know.
Hang up our guns?

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.444
Why is there no light switch?

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.364
Sometimes I think
that you hate me, Luke.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:31.647
You're my wife, Joanne.
I don't hate you.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.683
I know I can be a...

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.690
A taskmaster.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.844
Why is there no light switch?

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.081
But I just...

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.811
I feel in my bones that
what we're doing is right.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.080
And I think that the world
is starting to recognize it.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.571
You believe that, don't you?

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.404
I don't know.
Listen,

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.481
Dennis was afraid of the dark.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.608
A lot of kids are
afraid of the dark.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.808
Monsters under the bed,
in the closets,

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.087
so they keep the lights on, but
why no light switch at all?

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.161
Huh?

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.963
What happens if this
room goes dark?

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.451
Maybe we see something
that we're not supposed to.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.204
I know I can be

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.090
a bloodthirsty cur,

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.289
but I just can't bear
to half-ass it.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.525
- Come here.
- What?

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.962
Come here.
Stand right there.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.004
Look, man, I don't know
what you're thinking...

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.320
But I tried, but...

01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.482
Dude!
You are the man!

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.766
Thank you so much.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.450
But... Wait, what?

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.086
You know what this means for us?
It's like we're free.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:08.444
- Is your stepfather...
- Gone, gone, gone.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.960
I'll never mess with you again.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.042
I'll never let anyone
mess with you.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.283
Your secret's safe,
man, forever.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.171
I totally got your back.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.881
Ah!

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:49.601
Officer Pakowski, you lied about
what happened in that alley.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.966
Who told you to set up
El Vengador?

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.400
Who are you?

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.606
Give me a name.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.201
You're crazy!

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.482
You don't know who
you're dealing with!

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:00.848
Give me a name now.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.690
He'll kill me!

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.280
So will I.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.641
Captain Dearing!

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.126
It was Dearing.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.490
For your head.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.846
I'm Taylor.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:26.801
Zoe.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.685
Thanks for everything.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.360
You're welcome.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:34.166
Here's to having a life
way more exciting than mine.

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.527
You wouldn't like it.

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.171
I've got a lot of serious
people looking for me.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.726
The money in his room,
that's all I had.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.442
And I needed to disappear.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.685
I can write you a check.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.246
Seriously?

01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.684
I have way more
money than I need.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.371
I know what it feels like
to want to disappear.

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.926
Must be nice,
not worrying about money.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.247
Unless you earn it,

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.448
money always comes
with strings attached.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.210
Trust fund baby?

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.570
No shame in that.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:23.722
I'd trade my hustle
for it in a heartbeat.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.485
I wish I had the balls

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.325
to live without
a safety net like you.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.241
Hmm.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.606
I'm only on my knees
'cause there's nowhere to sit.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.241
I'm more concerned
with your faith in yourself

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.367
than your faith in God.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.845
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever
you were trying to tell me

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.490
at Oscar's funeral,

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.925
did it have something
to do with this?

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.641
Yes.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.810
What was Oscar up to?

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.211
He had a secret room
in the garage.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.486
A chart with photos
of cops and...

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.528
After June 13th,

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.287
your brother started an underground
railroad for evolved humans,

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:16.848
to help others like him
get to a safe place in Canada.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.846
Before Oscar died,
he said he was set up.

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.687
Oscar believed
there was a shadow unit

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.290
inside the police department

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.442
set up to compromise
the railroad.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.206
I have a name.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.644
Captain James Dearing.

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:35.246
Carlos, I have a favor to ask.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.120
I have to put two Evos,
good people,

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.645
on a boat to Vancouver.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.131
Their journey starts from
your brother's secret room.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.361
Tonight.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.802
Why do you care
so much about them?

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.926
My only calling is to minister

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.321
to the poor, troubled,
and persecuted,

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.166
and...

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.720
One more thing.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.091
I don't have a right
to be weirded out

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.243
by you and Brad
being bros, but I am.

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.600
Yeah, me too.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.610
He punched me the other day,

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.205
and now he's my best friend.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.165
The whole thing's so crazy.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.089
I mean, Brad thinks you
made his stepdad disappear,

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.764
but you swear you didn't.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.569
Yeah, on my mother's eyes.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.843
You won't say anything, right?

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.246
Tommy.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.724
There's something else.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.209
You can't tell anyone.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.890
I've been getting these
texts from someone

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.042
who I think is trying
to protect me.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.164
- From what?
- I don't know.

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.368
But whoever it is they are
the reason I didn't die

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.044
with Coach Lewis
in that church fire.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.685
When I touched
the flower this morning,

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.047
I was thinking about
the first time I saw you.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.521
I ordered
maple walnut.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.166
That's it!

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.530
Things go to whatever place you're
thinking about when you touch them.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.091
Do you remember
what you were thinking about

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:20.003
when you made
those two creeps disappear?

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.045
I was, uh,

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.368
I was afraid I was
being kidnapped again,

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.770
so I was thinking about the place
they took me when I was a kid.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.444
Observation windows.

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:01.483
What kind of demented
place is this?

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.970
How the hell
do we get out of here?

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.081
You...

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.641
Oh!

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.727
Joanne, damn it!

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.849
- Wait in the car.
- All right.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.810
<i>Level one.</i>

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.010
<i>Level five.</i>

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.281
Stevens!

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.240
Who did this?

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.805
A man and a woman.

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.405
What the hell is going on here?

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.531
Figured out a way
to monetize the Evos.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.089
Monetize them to do what?

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.885
Save the world.

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.251
How will they find...

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.924
Do they have Molly Walker?

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.881
Epic still launches tomorrow.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.003
That can't happen without her.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.560
She's the only one who could locate...
Is she in Midian?

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.600
Stevens?

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:48.561
Careful.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.961
Watch your step.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.442
This is Sylvia and Damon.

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.969
They had to leave their home in
Las Vegas because of her power.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.721
This tunnel leads to the harbor.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.280
There's a boat there waiting
to take you to Vancouver.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.967
Small token
of gratitude.

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.326
It's 24 karat.

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.726
Thank you.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.126
Oh, my God.

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.169
This is all of them.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.011
A whole list of all the freaks.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.851
Names, addresses.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.050
I don't believe it.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.291
Whose car is this?

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.521
Who cares?

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:20.966
What happened?

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:22.651
Where's my car?

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.406
A couple.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.528
They shot me,
and then they took it.

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.205
What went on in there?

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.210
Renautas is using powers
to create a new technology.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.125
They launch a product tomorrow
called Epic in Midian.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.043
And Molly Walker's
power drives it.

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.444
You were right.
Thanks.

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.289
I'll find something
to sew you up.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.885
Like what?
Like a doctor?

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.485
Some surgical equipment?

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:48.091
You're gonna be fine.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.322
We've got to get
to Midian and save Molly.

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.366
I, uh, I think
I got a concussion

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:17.724
on top of what she did.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.326
Good Samaritans,
what are you gonna do?

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.248
You drugged me, you bitch.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.531
Who are you?

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:35.481
The trust fund baby
that hustled you.

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:46.089
We have Molly Walker.

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:47.500
