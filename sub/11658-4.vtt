-Hi, Ma. How did you do?
-35 people signed up.

00:59.767 --> 01:02.100
Hey, that's great!

01:04.033 --> 01:06.233
Wait a minute, Ma.
Three of these people are dead.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.367
Who are they going to tell?

01:10.867 --> 01:12.867
-Hi.
-Oh, hi, Blanche.

01:12.934 --> 01:14.100
There you go.

01:15.433 --> 01:19.700
You've been gone three hours.
Only one guy signed this petition?

01:19.767 --> 01:23.767
Let me freshen up and change clothes.
I'll get you another.

01:26.066 --> 01:27.400
Girls...

01:28.033 --> 01:32.533
I've got some bad news. I couldn't get
Mrs. Claxton to sign the petition.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.633
That tree's on her property.

01:34.700 --> 01:38.033
Without her support,
the city will chop it down.

01:38.100 --> 01:43.533
Why would she want to cut down
that 200-year-old oak?

01:43.600 --> 01:47.567
Because she's a vile,
scum-sucking crank

01:47.633 --> 01:50.200
who gives nice old ladies
like me a bad name.

01:51.967 --> 01:55.300
Believe me,
she's a totally rotten human being.

01:56.767 --> 02:00.300
There's no such thing
as a totally rotten human being.

02:00.367 --> 02:02.066
There's some good in everybody.

02:02.133 --> 02:05.667
Sophia's right.
Mrs. Claxton's a mean old woman.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.033
The whole neighborhood hates her.

02:07.100 --> 02:09.900
-How can you say that?
-Come on. Last Halloween...

02:09.967 --> 02:13.467
half the kids in the neighborhood
wore Frieda Claxton costumes.

02:15.867 --> 02:19.400
Maybe she's one of those people
who needs some kindness.

02:19.467 --> 02:22.200
Like a fellow back home, Ernest T. Minky.

02:22.266 --> 02:24.867
I'm suddenly so hungry.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.333
Boy, that was a close call.

02:28.400 --> 02:33.133
If I have to listen to one more story
about people from St. Olaf, I'll explode.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.500
Ernest T. Minky
was St. Olaf's librarian.

02:36.567 --> 02:37.700
Kaboom.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.667
He was also our town's only dentist.

02:40.734 --> 02:44.467
His office was in the library
where he did both jobs at once.

02:44.533 --> 02:46.400
But everyone hated Minky.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.867
He seemed to take pleasure
in giving other people pain.

02:50.333 --> 02:54.700
They hated him so much,
nobody went to the dentist or the library.

02:55.734 --> 02:59.200
In 1938, you could tell
if someone was from St. Olaf.

02:59.467 --> 03:02.467
They were illiterate
and had teeth like Indian corn.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.433
Thank you, Rose.
That was a wonderful story.

03:08.233 --> 03:09.600
I'm only half done.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.867
I passed a kidney stone
less painful than this.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.800
One summer I worked up enough nerve

03:16.867 --> 03:18.900
to check out
the latest <i>Nancy Drew Mystery.</i>

03:18.967 --> 03:24.333
Mr. Minky was stamping my book and his
tie caught in the stamping machine.

03:24.400 --> 03:28.066
He'd have choked to death if I hadn't cut
his tie with my girl scout knife.

03:29.033 --> 03:33.133
He was so overwhelmed with gratitude,
he let me check my book out for a week.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.834
What's so special about that?

03:34.900 --> 03:38.033
Usually, he let you
check a book out for an hour.

03:38.433 --> 03:42.033
Mr. Minky said,
"Books belong in a library."

03:42.100 --> 03:45.700
Really? I thought Churchill
said that at Yalta.

03:47.066 --> 03:51.266
The point is, some people you think are
mean might need a little kindness.

03:51.333 --> 03:54.433
And people like old lady Claxton
are just plain rotten.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.567
I'm gonna prove you're all wrong.

03:57.934 --> 04:00.934
There's a week before the county
commissioner's meeting.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.166
I'm gonna be as nice to her as I can,
and I bet by the time I'm through,

04:05.233 --> 04:07.633
she'll be as anxious
to save that tree as we are.

04:08.567 --> 04:09.900
Hello, miss Claxton?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.066
This is Rose Nylund. How are you?

04:14.500 --> 04:17.467
I've never sat on one before,
but wouldn't that be painful?

04:26.834 --> 04:30.133
-Sophia, we can't do that.
-Why not?

04:30.200 --> 04:33.800
Stapling a $20 bill
to the petition is illegal.

04:34.867 --> 04:38.900
Don't tell us that's how you
did things in Sicily.

04:38.967 --> 04:41.367
That's not how we did things in Sicily.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.567
Bribing people's how we did things
in New York.

04:45.834 --> 04:48.567
In Sicily, you put a horse's head
in somebody's bed.

04:49.734 --> 04:52.133
Oh, Sophia, you're making that up.

04:52.200 --> 04:56.600
Like hell. Our garbage commissioner,
Fredo Lombardi, went on strike once.

04:56.867 --> 05:00.433
He woke up sharing a pillow
with national velvet.

05:01.700 --> 05:04.500
At 7 am, he was cleaning the street
with his tongue.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.300
We live in the greatest country
in the world,

05:08.367 --> 05:12.033
one founded on principles
of honesty, truth, and fairness.

05:12.100 --> 05:16.834
Once we present our petition,
the democratic system will prevail.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.800
Our endeavor to save that oak
will prove victorious.

05:20.867 --> 05:22.734
You certainly sound pretty confident.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.800
She slept with two of the commissioners.

05:28.433 --> 05:30.367
That works in Sicily and New York.

05:31.734 --> 05:35.367
Girls, I've got great news.
I've come from Mrs. Claxton's.

05:35.433 --> 05:38.867
-She wants to save the tree.
-You're kidding!

05:38.934 --> 05:41.066
-How did you manage that?
-Persistence.

05:41.133 --> 05:45.233
I visited her daily with varieties
of homemade Danish,

05:45.300 --> 05:48.700
begging her to listen.
She didn't want apricot.

05:48.767 --> 05:52.433
She didn't want cheese.
But today, the prune did the trick.

05:53.934 --> 05:55.400
Always does for me.

05:56.633 --> 06:00.133
After snarfing down two,
she said she'd save the tree.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.967
-Here comes the miserable old witch.
-Sophia!

06:04.033 --> 06:07.800
Well, Mrs. Claxton,
how lovely to see you again.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.900
Who are you?

06:08.967 --> 06:12.233
-I'm your neighbor, Blanche Devereaux.
-Oh, yeah.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.700
I didn't recognize you with your clothes
on.

06:16.967 --> 06:18.200
I beg your pardon?

06:18.266 --> 06:22.333
With my binoculars, I have a terrific view
in your bedroom window.

06:22.633 --> 06:25.900
Some stuff you do is illegal.
I'm looking into it.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.900
-Why, you miserable--
-Come on, Blanche.

06:29.967 --> 06:31.100
Let's try to get along.

06:31.166 --> 06:34.967
You may not remember me,
Dorothy Zbornak?

06:35.033 --> 06:38.834
Sure, I know you.
Nothing goes on in your bedroom.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.133
-Why, you miserable--
-Dorothy!

06:44.000 --> 06:48.300
Mrs. Claxton, we all appreciate
your coming down here in person

06:48.367 --> 06:49.667
to help us save the tree.

06:49.734 --> 06:55.467
I'm here to see they tear it down.
I hate trees! I hate people.

06:55.533 --> 06:59.633
-Rose told us you said you'd help.
-That's right.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.233
-And now you're not?
-Right.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.633
-Why lie?
-To get the Danish.

07:05.033 --> 07:07.266
There's nothing I hate more

07:07.333 --> 07:10.066
than someone who thinks
everybody living alone

07:10.133 --> 07:12.367
wants company and a few kind words.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.800
I live by myself because I like it.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.934
I've got no use for people, never have!
See you inside.

07:18.867 --> 07:22.033
-Where are you going?
-To throw holy water on her.

07:22.100 --> 07:25.533
If she spits up pea soup and her head
spins around, we're in big trouble.

07:32.266 --> 07:35.967
It's the consensus of the committee
that the promoter's petition

07:36.033 --> 07:38.567
for the menudo concert be denied.

07:39.700 --> 07:43.667
Next on the agenda
is the proposal to widen Richmond street.

07:43.734 --> 07:47.800
Will the representative
for blocking the proposal step forward?

07:47.867 --> 07:51.300
-Wish me luck.
-Why should you do it?

07:51.367 --> 07:53.233
We'll have a better chance.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.767
Dorothy, I'm a wonderful orator,

07:55.834 --> 07:58.100
and two of the commissioners
can verify that.

07:59.633 --> 08:02.900
Blanche... orator means speaker.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.200
Really?

08:07.400 --> 08:10.333
Oh! Well, then somebody else
do the talking.

08:11.633 --> 08:15.900
-Ladies, we're waiting.
-Let me save everyone a lot of time.

08:15.967 --> 08:20.033
My name's Frieda Claxton.
The tree's on my property.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.667
I could care less
if the city cuts it down.

08:23.734 --> 08:25.800
60 people live on that block.

08:25.867 --> 08:29.333
Everybody signed this petition
to save the tree.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.500
Concrete's cleaner. They'll adjust.

08:32.567 --> 08:36.567
-Mrs. Claxton, please!
-I have pictures of the tree.

08:36.633 --> 08:38.700
You want to look at pictures?

08:39.066 --> 08:41.133
I've got pictures...

08:42.400 --> 08:45.266
of her roommate, the human slinky!

08:47.567 --> 08:49.000
Shut up, Claxton!

08:49.066 --> 08:53.233
Were there, uh... any other faces
recognizable on those pictures?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.600
You shut up, too, Ed.

09:01.433 --> 09:03.900
Stop wasting the taxpayers' money!

09:03.967 --> 09:06.700
Yank out that tree
and start pouring cement!

09:06.767 --> 09:09.433
Think about what you're doing!

09:09.934 --> 09:13.066
That beautiful old tree is 200 years old.

09:13.333 --> 09:16.500
-How can you hate a living thing?
-I hate you.

09:18.700 --> 09:22.600
That's it! I've had it!

09:22.667 --> 09:26.433
If you can't treat people
like human beings,

09:26.500 --> 09:30.066
I'm sure as hell not going to waste
my time kissing your fanny!

09:30.133 --> 09:36.066
If you don't like it, Mrs. Claxton,
sit there and shut up while we talk!

09:36.133 --> 09:38.567
If you don't like it, just drop dead!

09:38.633 --> 09:39.967
Go on, Dorothy.

09:54.467 --> 09:57.266
-What happened?
-You remember saying, "drop dead"?

09:57.333 --> 09:59.800
-Yes.
-I think she did.

10:13.433 --> 10:14.834
Why do people die?

10:14.900 --> 10:18.667
I don't even know why fools fall in love.

10:21.734 --> 10:25.133
I might just as well have
shot her with a gun.

10:25.567 --> 10:28.033
Honey, the woman was 83.

10:28.100 --> 10:31.567
She had a heart attack.
It was a coincidence.

10:31.633 --> 10:35.266
You haven't slept for two nights.
Stop torturing yourself.

10:35.333 --> 10:38.467
-I guess you're right.
-Rose, honey, you can't sleep again?

10:38.533 --> 10:41.533
-No.
-You have to put this thing behind you.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.867
You killed Mrs. Claxton two days ago.

10:45.967 --> 10:47.367
Blanche.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.600
She died two days ago.
Rose knows she didn't do anything.

10:52.667 --> 10:57.133
She's just upset. Go to her funeral. Cry.
You'll feel better.

10:57.200 --> 11:01.834
There's no funeral.
She had no friends or relatives.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.767
She'll be buried in an unmarked grave
in a potter's field.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.834
Gee, that's too bad.
Any more cheesecake?

11:09.266 --> 11:11.667
Blanche, how can you be so callous?

11:11.734 --> 11:14.467
I'm sorry, but I'm not pretending
to mourn.

11:14.734 --> 11:17.734
She worked overtime
at being horrible and nasty.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.800
That's why nobody
wants to go to her funeral.

11:22.333 --> 11:26.333
How would you feel if you dropped dead
and nobody came to your funeral?

11:26.400 --> 11:29.734
It's probably a personal thing,
but for me...

11:30.000 --> 11:32.867
I think dropping dead
would be the bigger disappointment.

11:35.500 --> 11:39.633
-Tons of people will be at my funeral.
-How do you know?

11:39.700 --> 11:42.600
I was there at 16. I saw it all.

11:43.467 --> 11:44.767
What?

11:44.834 --> 11:48.100
Oh, 16 was a very difficult age for me.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.300
My hormones were racing.
My body was blossoming.

11:51.367 --> 11:54.100
I had urges and yearnings so strong.

11:54.166 --> 11:55.900
Sometimes I'd wake up in the night

11:55.967 --> 12:00.166
sweating, screaming, and clawing
like a trapped panther...

12:00.433 --> 12:03.200
unable to release the lusty, steamy
passions

12:03.266 --> 12:06.333
that constantly threatened
to erupt from within me.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.934
When I was 16, I had acne

12:10.000 --> 12:12.667
and played the accordion
in a marching band.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.800
Nothing went right that year...

12:17.166 --> 12:21.300
but the final indignity occurred during
the Miss Magnolia Blossom Pageant.

12:21.367 --> 12:25.834
Instead of awarding me the crown as the
most beautiful girl in the county...

12:26.166 --> 12:27.800
they made me runner-up

12:27.867 --> 12:30.734
and awarded me
Miss Congeniality instead.

12:31.433 --> 12:34.133
At that moment,
I vowed that town would pay

12:34.200 --> 12:37.767
for valuing my personality
over my perfect body.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.934
I hear Vanna White has this same problem.

12:43.533 --> 12:47.066
I decided to kill myself
to teach them a lesson.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.834
I phonied my death
in a riverboat accident.

12:50.133 --> 12:54.066
The captain, who I was secretly seeing,
helped me.

12:54.567 --> 12:59.533
Everything went perfectly.
The town never saw a funeral like mine...

12:59.600 --> 13:03.367
hundreds of people, beautiful eulogies.

13:03.433 --> 13:06.967
Just as the minister
got everybody grieving,

13:07.033 --> 13:10.300
I rushed out and said,
"Yoo-hoo, it's me, Blanche.

13:10.367 --> 13:11.867
I'm not really dead."

13:14.100 --> 13:15.233
Well, the next thing I knew,

13:15.300 --> 13:18.033
my daddy was horsewhipping
that riverboat captain...

13:18.367 --> 13:21.400
and dragging me to a religious girls'
school in Atlanta.

13:22.834 --> 13:26.433
Once my daddy got angry,
he could be a real peckerwood.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.900
What's everybody talking about?

13:31.200 --> 13:33.934
Ma, I can honestly say, I have no idea.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.133
We started out talking about
Mrs. Claxton's funeral.

13:39.200 --> 13:43.800
But somewhere along the way,
we segued into <i>Blanche: The Miniseries.</i>

13:43.867 --> 13:47.033
When's Claxton's funeral?
I want to pay my respects.

13:47.533 --> 13:49.767
Your respects?
I thought you hated her.

13:49.834 --> 13:55.467
I did, but when someone dies,
you show respect for life,

13:55.533 --> 13:57.133
no matter how wretched.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.266
Any idiot knows that.

13:58.333 --> 13:59.834
-I knew that.
-See?

14:04.100 --> 14:08.834
Mrs. Claxton isn't having a funeral.
She had no friends or relatives.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.900
-Then we'll pop for her funeral.
-Why?

14:11.967 --> 14:15.967
To show that we have regard
for human life.

14:16.033 --> 14:18.500
No. It's an old Sicilian custom.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.567
It's good luck
burying somebody you hate.

14:21.533 --> 14:23.133
Ma, you're not fooling me.

14:23.700 --> 14:27.300
You feel bad because Mrs. Claxton
didn't have anybody.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.233
Maybe I do. What's it to you?

14:30.300 --> 14:34.300
-You're right. I'll chip in.
-Sophia, count me in, too.

14:34.900 --> 14:38.100
Oh, Sophia,
I think you're a wonderful person.

14:38.467 --> 14:42.367
It's lovely that we're sharing
Mrs. Claxton's funeral expenses equally.

14:42.433 --> 14:44.900
Equally? Your share should be half.

14:46.934 --> 14:48.700
After all, you killed her.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.767
Let's hurry and get this over with.

15:00.834 --> 15:04.967
-Calm down.
-Funeral homes make me nervous.

15:05.033 --> 15:09.800
I've only been to two funerals,
and I'm 45 years old.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.600
You're such a liar.

15:12.767 --> 15:14.367
All right, then three funerals.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.934
Let's just hurry
and get out of here.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.133
-Hello.
-Aah!

15:20.200 --> 15:21.934
I'm fine.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.867
Funeral homes make her nervous.

15:24.934 --> 15:26.734
I was that way, too.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.166
At a traditional funeral home,
all they talk about is caskets,

15:30.233 --> 15:31.700
burials, dead people.

15:32.066 --> 15:35.233
We've eliminated that morbid stuff.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.100
What's this, a sushi bar?

15:38.333 --> 15:39.633
Come this way.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.066
This is our slumber chamber.

15:43.133 --> 15:45.500
Oh, here's my card.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.100
How may I serve you?

15:47.166 --> 15:51.500
-Well, Mr. Pfeiffer--
-That's p-Feiffer. The "p" is not silent.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.500
Uh...

15:57.633 --> 16:00.066
Well, Mr. P-Feiffer...

16:02.767 --> 16:04.734
we're interested in arranging a funeral.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.800
That's lovely,
you three planning ahead for mother.

16:12.567 --> 16:16.033
Hey, p-Feiffer, how would you like
a punch in your p-face?

16:21.467 --> 16:23.200
The funeral's for a neighbor.

16:23.266 --> 16:24.834
My condolences.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.834
No need. We didn't like her.

16:28.633 --> 16:30.400
The whole neighborhood despised her.

16:30.467 --> 16:33.066
-I see. How did she pass on?
-She killed her.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.200
Rough neighborhood.

16:38.300 --> 16:41.133
Look, Mr. P-Feiffer,

16:42.333 --> 16:44.600
about the p-funeral-- about the, uh...

16:46.166 --> 16:47.967
about the funeral arrangements...

16:48.033 --> 16:50.500
we'd like something simple, tasteful,

16:50.567 --> 16:52.333
-yet--
-Incredibly cheap.

16:53.066 --> 16:54.867
Let's get down to brass handles.

16:55.934 --> 16:57.567
I'd like to present the winner

16:57.633 --> 17:00.900
of the 1985 crypt and casket
design award.

17:00.967 --> 17:03.233
Paris has been talking about this one
all spring.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.600
-It's the omega 3000.
-How much?

17:05.667 --> 17:09.133
That top is embellished gold
leaf detail work.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.934
The satin interior's imported from a mill
outside Gstaad.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.166
-How much?
-It's lead-lined.

17:15.233 --> 17:18.300
We're not burying superman.
How much?

17:20.400 --> 17:21.500
$6,000.

17:21.567 --> 17:24.233
My first house didn't cost that much!

17:24.667 --> 17:29.333
Mr. P-Feiffer, we've told you
we are bereaved on a budget.

17:29.400 --> 17:33.100
If you can't accommodate us,
we'll find someone who can.

17:33.166 --> 17:38.200
The Avanti Supreme is a big seller.
That retails for just $3,000.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.567
-What's this?
-A pine box.

17:40.633 --> 17:42.133
-How much?
-$200.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.200
Sold.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.767
When would you like services?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.500
-Gee, I don't know.
-Thursday night?

17:48.567 --> 17:51.367
-You're crazy!
-Hell, no.

17:51.433 --> 17:53.934
Sorry. I forgot, <i>The Cosby Show.</i>

17:56.533 --> 17:59.266
-Friday?
-You have a TV guide we could check?

18:01.467 --> 18:03.400
-Friday will be fine.
-Thank you.

18:03.767 --> 18:07.967
Have you given any thought
to planning your own farewell?

18:08.033 --> 18:12.166
-No, but I'll go out with a bang.
-And she means that.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.900
Oh, my God, this is terrible.

18:24.600 --> 18:28.000
Such a tragedy. Such a tragedy.

18:28.066 --> 18:30.967
Ma, try not to upset yourself.

18:31.500 --> 18:37.033
Two men on, bottom of the ninth,
that baccigaloop Lasorda has him bunt!

18:37.433 --> 18:39.567
Give me that.

18:46.700 --> 18:48.500
Girls, I'm tired of sitting here.
Let's go.

18:49.133 --> 18:52.200
There was a newspaper announcement.

18:52.266 --> 18:55.533
Her friends must realize she died.
Why didn't they come?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.467
They were too busy celebrating.

18:58.767 --> 19:01.900
Go ahead. I want to sit here awhile.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.934
Oh, I hope I'm not too late
for the funeral.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.233
-Why, no. No, not at all.
-Thank goodness.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.166
I'd have felt terrible.

19:14.233 --> 19:16.300
She was one of my dearest friends.

19:16.367 --> 19:19.133
One of her dearest friends, Dorothy.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.600
Yes. Oh, my.

19:21.667 --> 19:24.867
We've been friends for nearly 60 years.

19:25.500 --> 19:30.300
-Would you mind saying a few words?
-Me, mind?

19:30.367 --> 19:32.667
Well, I'd be happy to.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.633
Up here...

19:35.467 --> 19:36.600
Oh.

19:40.367 --> 19:43.767
Today is a day of great sadness,
not only for me,

19:43.834 --> 19:49.500
but for many people whose lives
have been touched by the warmth

19:49.567 --> 19:51.967
of this woman lying here.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.100
I wish I knew how many charities

19:55.166 --> 19:59.166
and orphanages benefited
from her generosity.

19:59.467 --> 20:01.867
But now no one will ever know

20:01.934 --> 20:06.500
because she did all her good work
anonymously.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.133
I'm sure a lot
of people never knew

20:10.200 --> 20:14.867
that she worked
for 15 years in a leper colony.

20:14.934 --> 20:16.066
Oh!

20:19.133 --> 20:23.800
Yes, Celia Rubenstein
loved all mankind.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.734
-She was--
-Who?

20:30.800 --> 20:32.467
Celia Rubenstein.

20:32.533 --> 20:36.300
This funeral isn't Celia's Rubenstein's.
It's for Frieda Claxton.

20:37.033 --> 20:39.033
The Rubenstein funeral's
down the hall.

20:40.166 --> 20:44.567
Oh. I'm so sorry for the intrusion.

20:45.533 --> 20:47.000
Uh, Frieda Claxton?

20:47.400 --> 20:51.233
Wasn't she the woman who owned that old
house on Richmond street?

20:51.300 --> 20:52.633
Yes.

21:05.033 --> 21:08.800
You were all right.
Frieda didn't have a friend in the world.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.800
She didn't make any difference.

21:12.867 --> 21:16.667
-She might as well never even existed.
-Oh, Rose, honey.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.066
Let her be by herself.

21:18.133 --> 21:21.500
This has been a hell of a night.
I'm glad it's over.

21:21.567 --> 21:24.633
At least we've done the right thing.

21:25.266 --> 21:28.734
Mrs. Claxton's
in somebody else's hands now.

21:29.066 --> 21:32.433
-For the moment, she's in mine.
-What?

21:32.500 --> 21:36.433
Seems there was a mix-up,
and Mrs. Claxton was cremated by mistake.

21:36.967 --> 21:38.767
We never should have hired
a high-school student.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.500
Oh, well. Whatever.

21:44.166 --> 21:47.700
-Uh, ladies, you're forgetting something.
-What?

21:47.767 --> 21:49.867
Mrs. Claxton. We can't keep her.

22:02.734 --> 22:05.100
-Morning, Blanche.
-I wanna ask you something.

22:05.166 --> 22:06.633
Last night around 2 am,

22:06.700 --> 22:09.633
did you hear shrieking
and screaming and moaning?

22:09.700 --> 22:13.667
Mm, no, but usually, if your door
is closed, I can't hear anything.

22:18.500 --> 22:22.834
Not me. Those sounds were coming
from that urn with Mrs. Claxton in it.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.767
You were dreaming.

22:24.834 --> 22:27.567
This house is possessed by her spirit.

22:27.633 --> 22:29.500
-Morning.
-Sophia, listen.

22:29.567 --> 22:33.633
In the middle of the night, did you hear
some awful, terrible ghastly sounds?

22:33.700 --> 22:35.033
Heard 'em? I made 'em.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.734
There's a reason there's an expiration
date on cottage cheese.

22:40.834 --> 22:42.633
My kingdom for an Alka-Seltzer.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.667
Girls, I have great news.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.633
I found a final resting place
for Mrs. Claxton.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.533
Rose, you found one of her relatives?

22:52.600 --> 22:56.834
No. I spread her ashes
around her oak tree.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.266
What on earth for?

22:58.333 --> 23:01.834
-To prove her life had meaning.
-As fertilizer?

23:01.900 --> 23:05.734
No. After I spread the ashes
and said a little prayer,

23:05.800 --> 23:08.367
I went to city hall and told them.

23:09.133 --> 23:14.467
I said it's not good to disturb someone's
final resting place.

23:14.900 --> 23:17.233
It doesn't look like
they'll cut down the tree.

23:17.300 --> 23:21.767
Rose, that's lovely. Odd but lovely.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.467
Come look at the tree.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.500
Isn't it breathtaking?

23:29.000 --> 23:32.934
-Oh, it sure is.
-Now it'll always be there.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.734
-All because of Mrs. Claxton.
-I guess you were right all along.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.100
Mrs. Claxton did have
a reason for being here.

23:41.166 --> 23:43.567
That tree will be a reminder to me,

23:43.633 --> 23:48.533
a reminder to do something nice
for somebody else.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.600
I want my life
to have meaning while I'm alive.

23:52.433 --> 23:56.333
-What's everyone looking at?
-That beautiful old oak tree.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.867
Mrs. Claxton's spirit's
part of that tree now.

23:59.934 --> 24:01.166
That's really lovely.

24:01.767 --> 24:04.767
It's touching how that Great Dane
is paying its respects.

24:14.567 --> 24:19.367
(theme music playing)
