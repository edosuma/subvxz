DIRECTOR:
Okay, people, we are trying

01:45.688 --> 01:47.524
to depict
the sizzling final days

01:47.607 --> 01:50.110
of the Nathan Lane
of the New Testament, Jesus Christ.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.153
Now remember,
this is the Passion Play,

01:52.237 --> 01:53.363
not The Phone It In Play.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.241
not the I Once Had Three Shows
on Broadway Simultaneously

01:56.324 --> 01:59.202
But I Blew All My Money on Coke
and Now Here I Am Play,

01:59.285 --> 02:00.120
so let's do this thing!

02:00.203 --> 02:02.872
Hi. My name is
Milhouse Van Houten,

02:02.956 --> 02:06.292
and I am auditioning
for the role of Child Who Points.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.836
Yeah, okay, point stage left.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.463
I prepared right!

02:10.547 --> 02:12.132
Well, I better get going.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.342
This is starting to feel
a little churchy.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.553
Why do we have to audition
for the stupid play,

02:16.636 --> 02:17.595
and Dad gets to leave?

02:17.679 --> 02:19.097
I already have my part.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.141
Man Who Buys Ticket,
But Doesn't Show Up.

02:21.224 --> 02:24.561
Also, the Passion Play
isn't stupid.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.604
It's the greatest story
ever told.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.022
Maybe it was once,

02:28.106 --> 02:30.441
but now there's
lots of better stories.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.734
<i>Krusty vs. the F.D.A.</i>

02:31.818 --> 02:34.612
Game Six of
the 2011 World Series.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.448
-Hitler mashups!
-And Lenny's story about Cancun.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.826
Yeah, why aren't we
doing Lenny's story?

02:39.909 --> 02:41.119
That thing's hilarious.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.829
Not so hilarious for me.

02:42.912 --> 02:43.830
I nearly lost a toe.

02:43.913 --> 02:44.998
That's what you get

02:45.081 --> 02:46.875
for having a monkey
give you a foot massage.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.043
My bucket list
is my business.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.296
-Next audition!
-Ah-ha. Name's Ned Flanders.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.882
Credits include Jesus
in the Passion Play last year,

02:53.965 --> 02:55.800
Jesus in the Passion Play
the year before that,

02:55.884 --> 02:59.679
Jesus, Jesus, a kindly hobo
who turns out to be--

02:59.762 --> 03:01.014
you guessed it-- Saint Peter...

03:01.097 --> 03:02.223
Enough! Enough, already.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.975
I'm so bored I'm ready
to introduce myself

03:04.058 --> 03:05.143
to my two assistants here.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.270
You will be
a non-speaking Pharisee.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.397
-But-but-but...
-Jesus didn't stammer!

03:09.480 --> 03:10.899
His voice hit the back
of the theater!

03:10.982 --> 03:12.859
He was a god
who turned water into wine

03:12.942 --> 03:14.235
and did not wear shoes.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.320
Ooh!

03:15.403 --> 03:16.988
He said simple things
that many followed.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.489
Just like me on Twitter!

03:18.573 --> 03:20.658
(chuckles)

03:20.742 --> 03:22.994
And he was tragically killed
while still in his 30s...

03:23.077 --> 03:25.038
-D'oh!
-...after an all-night dinner.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.332
Woo-hoo!
I'm your Jesus! Me!

03:27.415 --> 03:28.958
Boom. Done.
This guy's perfect!

03:29.042 --> 03:31.502
You understand why God
would have forsaken him.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.630
(chuckling)

03:33.713 --> 03:35.548
Well, congratulations, Homer.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.759
I guess this is just
my cross to bear.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.093
What's that a reference to?

03:39.177 --> 03:40.345
Oh!

03:41.262 --> 03:43.097
Ooh, nice and roomy.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.725
Our Lord sure knew
how to keep 'em cool.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.060
-Dad?
-Yes, sweetie?

03:47.143 --> 03:48.019
First of all,

03:48.102 --> 03:49.896
congratulations
on getting the lead.

03:49.979 --> 03:53.608
Whee! Whee!

03:53.691 --> 03:55.693
I just hope you're going
to take this seriously.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.819
Oh, yes, Lisa.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.947
Very seriously. Whee!

03:59.030 --> 04:00.865
Dad, the story of the Passion

04:00.949 --> 04:02.951
is the cornerstone
of the Christian faith.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.285
And although I personally follow

04:04.369 --> 04:06.079
the enlightened teachings
of Lord Buddha,

04:06.162 --> 04:08.748
messing with Jesus
really gets people mad.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.125
It's like wearing
a Florida State jersey

04:11.209 --> 04:12.293
to a Florida game.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.461
(gasps)

04:13.544 --> 04:14.963
Oh, Lord, why have you placed

04:15.046 --> 04:17.465
this fearsome burden
on my shoulders?

04:17.548 --> 04:19.050
(sobbing)

04:19.133 --> 04:21.302
It'll be fine.
Just learn your lines.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.805
Does Jesus have a big part
in this thing?

04:23.888 --> 04:25.056
He's in every scene.

04:25.139 --> 04:26.391
What?

04:26.474 --> 04:27.976
(sobbing loudly)

04:28.059 --> 04:31.980
Why do I succeed at everything
I audition for?

04:34.524 --> 04:36.609
Dear Lord, I know you see all,

04:36.693 --> 04:39.946
but trust me,
You do not want to see this.

04:40.863 --> 04:44.784
And so our Lord was brought
before Pontius Pilate.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.119
What's he in for?

04:46.202 --> 04:49.038
He calls himself
"King of the Jews."

04:49.122 --> 04:51.374
Oh, boy.
Okay, be straight with me.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.876
You can probably
plead this down to crucifixion.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.587
Do you call yourself
King of the Jews?

04:56.671 --> 04:58.047
Thou sayest it.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.549
(exclaiming)

04:59.632 --> 05:01.342
He's good.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.720
Wow, I'm so moved
I renounce science,

05:03.803 --> 05:05.221
with the facts,
and the peer reviews,

05:05.305 --> 05:08.224
and the hypotheses
tested by evidence.

05:08.308 --> 05:12.812
What shall I do then with Jesus,
which is called Christ?

05:12.895 --> 05:14.480
Crucify him!

05:14.564 --> 05:16.441
They cannot judge me.

05:16.524 --> 05:19.152
Only my father can judge me.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.820
Crucify him!

05:20.903 --> 05:22.572
I'll take you with me, old man!

05:22.655 --> 05:25.074
Jesus was handed
a heavy cross,

05:25.158 --> 05:27.910
and upon his brow
was placed a crown...

05:27.994 --> 05:30.496
-Ooh!
-...of thorns.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.123
What the...?

05:33.499 --> 05:35.877
(groans)

05:36.377 --> 05:37.795
(crying)

05:37.879 --> 05:39.589
Daughters of Jerusalem!

05:39.672 --> 05:41.883
Weep not for me,

05:41.966 --> 05:43.509
but weep for yourselves.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.804
You know, Homer's giving it
the old Bible-college try.

05:46.888 --> 05:50.016
Maybe I should've dialed down
the Doubting Thomas.

05:50.099 --> 05:52.185
Silence, Pharisee!

05:58.107 --> 06:00.401
(grunting)

06:01.611 --> 06:05.782
Looks like someone didn't
follow the underwear rule!

06:07.200 --> 06:10.119
This man is totally
the Son of God.

06:10.203 --> 06:14.165
Tonight you shall be
at my right hand in heaven.

06:14.248 --> 06:15.958
All right!

06:16.042 --> 06:17.752
It pays to network
at these things.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.923
Jesus cried again
with a loud voice

06:22.006 --> 06:24.258
and yielded up his spirit.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.886
(cries out in anguish)

06:33.184 --> 06:35.686
(quietly)
Lord, forgive me for my pride.

06:35.770 --> 06:39.774
All wise as always, you have
rightly raised Homer above me.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.526
Never again will I question...

06:41.609 --> 06:42.777
(yells)

06:42.860 --> 06:45.196
-Out of my way, stupid Flanders!
-Ow!

06:45.279 --> 06:47.365
Ah, I knew we should've done
<i>Spamalot.</i>

06:47.448 --> 06:49.117
I'm not licked.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.536
I'll just make them
think this was planned.

of the immediate family allowed in.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.137
It's okay.
She's my wife.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.471

07:12.140 --> 07:15.143
That's right. Ha!

07:15.226 --> 07:16.602
-CROWD: Wow!
-Oh, my goodness.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.645
Hey, Dad.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.273
You remember when you said
if Flanders got remarried

07:20.356 --> 07:21.357
you'd eat your hat?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.526
Uh-oh.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.654
Ooh, licorice!

07:28.489 --> 07:31.659
Mmm, historically inaccurate.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.292
Well, it was nice having
a secret marriage while it lasted.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.086
Well, sir, now we'll
have an open marriage!

07:42.170 --> 07:43.379
Um...

07:43.463 --> 07:45.214
you do know what that means?

07:45.298 --> 07:48.384
No, but I'm sure Newt Gingrich
wouldn't steer us wrong.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.844
At least in the hospital

07:49.927 --> 07:52.472
we can just enjoy a nice,
quiet moment together.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.809
(chuckling)

07:56.893 --> 08:00.104
Congratulations, you two!

08:00.188 --> 08:01.731
We're so, so happy for you.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.649
Welcome to marriage.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.692
(laughs)

08:04.775 --> 08:07.028
Another good man
bites the dust.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.112
Homer!

08:08.196 --> 08:09.363
I'm talking about this guy!

08:12.325 --> 08:13.826
Oh, I sure envy him.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.036
Homer!

08:15.119 --> 08:16.412
I mean, I envy Flanders,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.706
once again enjoying
the joys of marriage.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.500
Let's put it to a vote,
America.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.001
Enough with the voting.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.253
Ned, Edna,
why didn't you tell us?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.505
'Cause everyone in this town

08:25.588 --> 08:27.757
makes such a big heckabaloo
out of everything.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.342
Nedding bells are ringing.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.386
See what happens
when Teachy met Preachy

08:32.470 --> 08:33.429
on Channel 6,

08:33.513 --> 08:36.307
your source for news-based puns.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.768
I was just down the hall
getting some very bad news,

08:38.851 --> 08:40.436
and I saw there was
a party going on.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.688
Congratulations from the Mayor.
Vote Quimby.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.358
Many happy returns!

08:45.441 --> 08:46.859
Hope you're both happy.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.819
Edna, as the runner-up
in the race for your heart,

08:48.903 --> 08:50.947
I would like to make a toast.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.324
My Dearest,
let me be the first to offer you

08:53.407 --> 08:55.952
the hearty handshake
that would've climaxed

08:56.035 --> 08:57.495
our own wedding day...

08:57.578 --> 09:01.207
Seymour, did you use my wig glue
to patch your shoes again?

09:01.290 --> 09:04.043
I tied them together
with used dental floss,

09:04.126 --> 09:05.378
as per your memo!

09:05.461 --> 09:07.296
Everybody out. Now!

09:07.380 --> 09:08.881
(grumbling)

09:10.424 --> 09:12.885
-Not you.
-Mmm.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.557
O Lord, please bless
our blended family.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.351
And thank you
for "cigarette mommy."

09:20.434 --> 09:22.311
Oh, honey, please don't
call me that.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.980
Okay, "do-over mommy."

09:24.063 --> 09:26.232
Boys, you will please
call your new mother

09:26.315 --> 09:28.401
whatever she feels
comfortable with.

09:28.484 --> 09:29.485
How about "Edna?"

09:29.569 --> 09:30.820
It's disrespectful

09:30.903 --> 09:32.655
to call a grown-up
by their first name.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.240
BART:
Yo, Homer,

09:34.323 --> 09:36.742
Mom says get your fat ass
over to the Flanders'.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.661
Bart! Don't call me that!

09:38.744 --> 09:40.997
Which one?
"Homer" or "fat ass"?

09:41.080 --> 09:42.206
HOMER:
Why, you little...

09:42.290 --> 09:45.334
They're both bad,
and I suspect you know it!

09:45.418 --> 09:48.838
BART: Get your hands
off of me, you fat ass!

09:48.921 --> 09:50.840
(doorbell rings)

09:50.923 --> 09:52.258
Ned, Edna.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.010
-We just want to apologize...
-(growling)

09:54.093 --> 09:55.761
...for the commotion
in your room.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.723
People here do not
respect boundaries.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.225
Homer, did you just buckle
your belt through my loop?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.102
Sorry.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.688
Well, we're here to offer
to throw you a little party

10:05.771 --> 10:06.772
in your honor.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.024
A little party might be fun.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.943
The only guests at our wedding
were Ned's parents.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.945
Look at those squares,

10:13.029 --> 10:14.697
makin' it nice and legal.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.782
We didn't need a piece of paper!

10:16.866 --> 10:18.492
We had a paper, Nedward.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.786
We just rolled it
and smoked it.

10:20.870 --> 10:21.954
Oh, yeah.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.790
We got high-diddily-high
on that reeferino.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.209
Less news from the pews.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.629
Okay, Simpsons.
Well, call me a cock-eyed optimist

10:29.712 --> 10:32.715
'cause I think some sort
of celebration party

10:32.798 --> 10:33.799
might possibly be fun!

10:33.883 --> 10:36.135
Great!
We'll take care of everything.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.179
We'll just need
to borrow your punch bowl,

10:38.262 --> 10:40.848
17 chairs,
your portable dance floor,

10:40.931 --> 10:42.850
your banner printer,
banner ink,

10:42.933 --> 10:45.394
and a ream of blank banners.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.856
Okay, there's no school;

10:48.939 --> 10:51.901
your dad's at work;
and it's really coming down.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.069
Anyone for Scrabble?

10:53.152 --> 10:55.571
Only God can make words.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.490
Right, right. Yahtzee?

10:57.573 --> 10:59.158
Dice are Satan's bones.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.910
What the hey, Mrs. K?

11:00.993 --> 11:02.578
Thank God, a real kid.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.622
You want my advice
on dealing with the Hardly Boys?

11:04.705 --> 11:05.790
Why do you care?

11:05.873 --> 11:08.668
I don't. I'm just bored
watching worms drown.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.794
Okay, what do you got?

11:09.877 --> 11:12.838
Well, what you got to do
is get them into the real world.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.840
Skipping is cool!

11:14.924 --> 11:17.843
Especially when you're holding
hands with your brother.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.970
If you don't act now,
when they grow up,

11:20.054 --> 11:21.389
people like me
are gonna take

11:21.472 --> 11:23.099
all their money
and girlfriends.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.434
Oh, come on.
They're not that hopeless.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.603
I'm doing it!
I'm doing it!

11:27.687 --> 11:28.688
(whimpers)

11:32.024 --> 11:34.860
This is my third-favorite
wedding supply store.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.696
Whoo! Look at these.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.030
"Extreme weddings.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.241
Triathlon...
Zero-G...

11:40.324 --> 11:43.285
Tie the knot
at the top of Mount Everest"?

11:48.124 --> 11:49.333
It's extreme enough
for me

11:49.417 --> 11:52.336
when they smear the wedding cake
on each other's faces.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.505
So, Marge,
the rumors are true.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.173
Why did you get
to throw a party

11:56.257 --> 11:58.342
for Ned and Edna
and not me?

11:58.426 --> 12:01.470
Well, you're all invited so you
can make your snippy comments

12:01.554 --> 12:04.014
while you eat
my hors d'oeuvres.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.475
Snippy? How can you say that
in those shoes?

12:06.559 --> 12:07.393
(grunts)

12:07.476 --> 12:10.062
They have Itchy and Scratchy
weddings?

12:15.901 --> 12:17.903
(laughing)

12:21.490 --> 12:22.908
Ready to go home, Ned?

12:22.992 --> 12:25.035
I'm sorry, honey, but I'm
stuck in this meeting

12:25.119 --> 12:26.412
of the Springfield LGBT.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.957
The left-gifted bidextrous
and transhanded community.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.252
We're trying to decide on the theme
for our Left is Right parade.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.337
"Our Scissors, Ourselves."

12:35.421 --> 12:36.589
How about,
"Death to Righties"?

12:36.672 --> 12:38.424
We have to live
among them.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.259
To live among them
is to die.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.594
(all arguing)

12:41.677 --> 12:43.387
Oh, this could go late.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.222
We haven't even ordered
pizzas and pop yet.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.932
Could you handle
Rod and Todd's

12:47.016 --> 12:48.601
parent-teacher
conference for me?

12:48.684 --> 12:50.436
Sure, I'd love
to be the parent for once.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.146
Now I can bring a latte

12:52.229 --> 12:53.939
and leave the cup
on the desk. Ha!

12:54.023 --> 12:55.441
(glass breaks)

12:55.524 --> 12:59.028
Sorry. I'm still
a pre-op transhander.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.071
TEACHER:
Well, I must say at this school

13:01.155 --> 13:03.491
<i>we've never seen</i>
<i>a step-parent before.</i>

13:03.574 --> 13:05.701
Look, I'm a chalk jockey, too,

13:05.785 --> 13:07.203
so don't slap ketchup
on bread

13:07.286 --> 13:09.246
and tell me it's Pizza Friday.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.373
You teach with that mouth?

13:11.457 --> 13:14.960
Yes. I teach
at Springfield Elementary,

13:15.044 --> 13:17.379
-and we believe that...
-Public school?

13:17.463 --> 13:19.673
Well, I'll be a monkey's
unrelated creature.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.718
Well, we'll fit you
into our school prayers.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.054
You do have science
here, right?

13:25.137 --> 13:27.556
We sure do.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.059
Behold advanced astronomy.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.896
You pulled the boys
out of school?

13:33.979 --> 13:36.065
Ned, I know I should have
consulted you,

13:36.148 --> 13:37.691
but that school
is beneath them.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.236
Take my word as a teacher
of 15 years.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.737
Well, sir, when we got married,

13:41.821 --> 13:43.989
I knew I'd find some spices
in my chili.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.867
I guess they can go
to Springfield Hellementary.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.577
-Oh!
-Mm-hmm.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.496
(moaning)

14:00.840 --> 14:02.842
Why are we here, Neddy?

14:02.925 --> 14:04.844
Well, first of all,
I think talking dogs

14:04.927 --> 14:06.387
-are the spawn of the devil.
-Yeah, but...

14:06.470 --> 14:10.516
Secondly, we're watching my little
Toddy graduate from college.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.060
Oh, now aren't you glad
you let Edna take charge

14:13.143 --> 14:14.728
of the boys' education?

14:14.812 --> 14:16.480
Yep, it's lucky
she's not in my taxes

14:16.564 --> 14:18.190
'cause I underestimated her.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.734
Wait a minute.
Liberal professors,

14:20.818 --> 14:23.404
feminist workshops,
abstract sculptures.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.531
This isn't a Midwestern
Bible college.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.534
This is an elite
East Coast university.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.328
It's okay, Daddy.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.456
-I majored in religious studies.
-Whew!

14:34.540 --> 14:37.334
Comparative religious studies.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.211
(screams)

14:44.425 --> 14:45.801
(tires screech)

14:45.885 --> 14:47.511
Give me your keys!

14:47.595 --> 14:49.889
Maybe I'll just park it myself.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.142
Why are you parking yourself?
Why are you parking yourself?

14:53.225 --> 14:56.228
We haven't taken in
one car all day.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.775
You really put on
a great reception, Marge.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.694
It's like the happy flashback

15:03.777 --> 15:05.154
in a gritty cop thriller.

15:05.237 --> 15:09.825
Thank you.
Everyone's having a great time.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.076
Uh-oh.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.829
Helen, have a canapé.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.748
There's enough for everyone.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.208
But not too much.
(chuckles)

15:18.292 --> 15:20.002
(gasps)

15:20.085 --> 15:21.170
(both giggling)

15:21.253 --> 15:22.588
Yar...

15:22.671 --> 15:24.214
No weird hookups!

15:24.298 --> 15:25.925
Call me!

15:26.008 --> 15:27.384
I'm married to the sea,

15:27.468 --> 15:29.678
and I'm seeing two
of the Great Lakes on the side.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.055
I won't say which ones,

15:31.138 --> 15:34.850
but it's eerie
how superior they are.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.189
So how do the boys
like Springfield Elementary?

15:40.272 --> 15:42.107
Marge, it's wonderful.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.777
They're opening up,
they've seen a wider world.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.029
I wrote with a Flair pen.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.365
(chuckles)
Well, that's just great, boys.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.034
Now come over here so
Mrs. Simpson can take a photo.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.453
Make sure our temporary tats
are in the picture.

15:54.536 --> 15:57.081
Mine's a sassy princess
who speaks her mind.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.082
Oh!

15:58.165 --> 15:59.667
Mine's a duck
with no pants.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.418
What if we were
raptured right now?

16:01.502 --> 16:03.921
Ned,
I said it was okay.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.631
Yeah, chillax, Daddy.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.841
Chillax?
Young man, in the Flanders' house

16:07.925 --> 16:09.385
we speak the King's diddily.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.594
Time for cake!

16:10.678 --> 16:12.388
Let's finish this sucker up.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.265
You get my boys tattoos,
you change their school,

16:15.349 --> 16:18.727
you buy Rod sneakers that light
up like Times Square.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.854
Shoes are shoes
and lights are lights.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.732
Now just when do I get a say
in how my boys are raised?!

16:23.816 --> 16:25.567
This marriage isn't perfect!

16:25.651 --> 16:27.236
(phones beeping)

16:27.319 --> 16:29.238
No video! Party over!

16:29.321 --> 16:31.407
Cake!

16:31.490 --> 16:32.908
Too late, Marge.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.994
Mm!

16:35.077 --> 16:37.746
Ned, these boys trust me
to be their mother.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.249
You'd better decide
whether you do.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.626
(gasps)

16:44.003 --> 16:45.963
And that's that.
Another story in the classic,

16:46.046 --> 16:48.173
infallible three-act structure.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.466
Good enough for Aristotle,

16:49.550 --> 16:50.968
good enough for the Simpsons.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.761
Mr. Syzslak,
I have a feeling

16:52.845 --> 16:54.930
there's gonna be one more act
to this story.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.099
Well, I'm not hanging
around for that.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.350
Four acts...

17:02.771 --> 17:04.773
Ned, how did you sleep?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.191
Fine, I guess.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.818
Thanks for loaning me
your pajamas, Homer.

17:07.901 --> 17:11.363
And, Marge, thank you for those
helpful chip bag clips.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.866
(clacking)

17:14.533 --> 17:16.201
I just felt so ashamed,

17:16.285 --> 17:17.369
I couldn't go home.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.580
Yesterday
I gave in to the one thing

17:19.663 --> 17:24.209
I vowed I would never have
in my marriage: strong feeling.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.754
Here's your lunches...
with some cake.

17:26.837 --> 17:30.382
You'll be having cake
for a long, long time.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.301
Bart, aren't you
gonna tell Mom and Dad

17:32.384 --> 17:33.719
about the problem
you have?

17:33.802 --> 17:34.887
Shut up!

17:34.970 --> 17:36.597
I'm just saying
it won't get better

17:36.680 --> 17:38.557
unless you talk
to an adult.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.100
Maggie knows how
to keep a secret.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.143
Why can't you?

17:43.729 --> 17:46.023
Bart, is there something
you want to tell us?

17:46.106 --> 17:47.316
Oh, Marge,
let the kid have

17:47.399 --> 17:50.235
his embarrassing secrets
and lies.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.237
That is totally
irresponsible parenting.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.239
Not according to the Internet.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.824
Where on the Internet?

17:55.908 --> 17:59.286
I'm sure some idiot somewhere
agrees with me.

17:59.369 --> 18:00.746
Why would you believe him?

18:00.829 --> 18:03.415
Because his avatar
is Darth Maul,

18:03.499 --> 18:05.793
the second-coolest Darth.

18:05.876 --> 18:09.171
And what he says is true
because it's in all caps.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.006
Are you gonna argue with caps?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.341
Why does that make it right?

18:12.424 --> 18:15.344
He took the time to press
the shift key, Marge.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.429
I think he knows
what he's talking about.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.099
So after all this time together
you two still haven't agreed

18:20.182 --> 18:21.517
on how to raise your kids?

18:21.600 --> 18:24.436
Ned, I realized long ago
there are some things

18:24.520 --> 18:27.397
Homer and I will never
completely agree on.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.441
(chuckles)
Yeah, but we make sure

18:29.525 --> 18:31.235
never to go to bed hungry.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.402
It's "angry."

18:32.486 --> 18:34.113
Don't tell me
what our thing is!

18:34.196 --> 18:36.198
It's about not
agreeing on something.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.534
I've always said hungry!

18:38.617 --> 18:40.786
Bart,
just tell us the problem.

18:42.538 --> 18:45.374
I'm keeping a dolphin
in my bathtub!

18:45.457 --> 18:47.793
I thought I heard
clicks and pops!

18:47.876 --> 18:49.128
(microphone feeds back)

18:49.211 --> 18:50.796
Children, your test scores
are down

18:50.879 --> 18:52.589
because we've been having
so many assemblies,

18:52.673 --> 18:54.508
you haven't had time to study.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.051
This assembly will remedy that.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.302
We've invited
a few friends over

18:57.386 --> 18:59.513
to give you some musical cues.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.348
(piano plays bouncy intro)

19:01.431 --> 19:03.934
I'm Sally Scantron Sheet.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.185
And I'm Peter Pencil.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.104
Now, you didn't hear it
from us,

19:07.187 --> 19:09.398
but the answers
to the test are...

19:09.481 --> 19:13.735
<i>(to tune of "Mary Had a Little Lamb")</i>
<i>♪ A, B, D, D, C, A, B... ♪</i>

19:13.819 --> 19:15.821
Are you just giving
them the answers?

19:15.904 --> 19:17.656
They still have
to sign their names properly,

19:17.739 --> 19:19.408
so we're not totally
out of woods.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.660
Pause the assembly!

19:21.743 --> 19:23.579
I have to talk to my wife.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.747
-Ned?
-My rival.

19:25.831 --> 19:26.832
Some rivalry.

19:26.915 --> 19:29.835
It's like Secretariat
versus a can of dog food.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.671
Edna, I'm sorry,
and I'll say it in front of God

19:32.754 --> 19:33.672
or Groundskeeper Willie.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.257
Oh, Ned,
I'm sorry, too.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.050
I overstepped
your boundaries.

19:37.134 --> 19:40.512
I guess I never really truly cared
about children before.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.140
-(all gasp)
-Oh, get over it.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.558
And, Ned, I'll be exactly

19:44.641 --> 19:46.518
as much mom as you
want me to be.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.812
Hey, the Simpsons
make it up as they go along,

19:48.896 --> 19:50.689
and they're as happy
as a ribbon in a Bible.

19:50.772 --> 19:53.108
-What do you say, sweetie?
-Ha!

19:53.192 --> 19:54.526
-Mmm...
-Mmm...

19:54.610 --> 19:56.778
(cheering)

19:56.862 --> 19:59.198
Now in our 50th location
in Springfield.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.950
Sleazy Sam would like
to welcome our special

20:02.034 --> 20:05.537
grand-opening star,
Jesus.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.040
Welcome, money changers.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.541
You can trust Sleazy Sam

20:09.625 --> 20:13.670
for the best rates,
or my name isn't Jesus H....

20:13.754 --> 20:15.547
-(thunder cracks)
-Ow!

20:15.631 --> 20:16.882
Are you gonna do that

20:16.965 --> 20:18.800
every time
I open one of these?
