00:14.032 --> 00:17.263
- Tell me what does
music mean to you?

00:17.327 --> 00:18.353
Yes?

00:18.417 --> 00:20.400
- How old are you?

00:20.463 --> 00:22.096
- Well, how old
do you think I am?

00:22.160 --> 00:23.160
- 70?

00:23.216 --> 00:26.449
- 70, do I look like that?

00:26.512 --> 00:27.344
Really?

00:27.408 --> 00:28.176
Anyone else?

00:28.239 --> 00:29.807
Anyone--how--
what does music

00:29.873 --> 00:31.280
make you feel?
Yes?

00:31.344 --> 00:32.591
- Nothing.

00:32.655 --> 00:33.969
- That's a really good answer.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.073
That's really good because

00:35.088 --> 00:37.359
music, indeed,
is nothing.

00:37.423 --> 00:38.704
It's just vibrations

00:38.768 --> 00:40.207
that travel through the air.

00:40.271 --> 00:42.064
We connect it with our emotions

00:42.128 --> 00:44.463
and with everything
that we like or dislike.

00:44.529 --> 00:46.832
That's when music
becomes something.

00:46.896 --> 00:47.823
Very good, very good answer.

00:47.887 --> 00:48.816
- I have a question.

00:48.880 --> 00:49.776
- Yes?

00:49.840 --> 00:52.240
- What does music mean to you?

00:53.936 --> 00:55.503
- It's--it's my life.

00:55.567 --> 00:57.200
It's what I...

00:57.265 --> 00:59.311
It's what I think
about all the time.

00:59.375 --> 01:00.783
I wake up with it.

01:00.848 --> 01:02.542
I go to sleep with it.

01:02.545 --> 01:04.593
It's actually the way
that I communicate

01:04.656 --> 01:06.992
with the world and with myself.

01:11.087 --> 01:13.102
So it means everything, really.

01:13.105 --> 01:15.664
If music suddenly
disappeared for me...

01:17.551 --> 01:18.864
I don't know.

01:18.927 --> 01:21.168
- So Winklestrauss said
we don't the votes?

01:21.231 --> 01:22.287
- No, not exactly.

01:22.352 --> 01:23.376
- Shit.

01:23.439 --> 01:24.753
Where does he stand?

01:24.817 --> 01:25.817
- He's a good guy.

01:25.840 --> 01:26.992
He's sympathetic.

01:27.055 --> 01:28.207
- But he said we're
gonna be having

01:28.271 --> 01:29.271
lots of free time.

01:29.295 --> 01:31.152
- Free time is overrated.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.302
I'm back!

01:32.305 --> 01:35.664
- Darling, welcome.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.104
- There is a magic

01:37.168 --> 01:39.695
in what we do...

01:39.759 --> 01:41.743
if we do what we do

01:41.807 --> 01:45.265
the right way, yeah?

01:45.328 --> 01:46.575
As long as I'm up here,

01:46.704 --> 01:48.625
the right way is...

01:50.031 --> 01:51.055
My way.

01:51.121 --> 01:52.144
- Oh, brother.

01:52.207 --> 01:53.456
- When I was a baby,

01:53.521 --> 01:56.305
sucking at my mom's tit, yeah?

01:56.367 --> 01:58.222
I heard Beethoven's "Fifth."

01:58.224 --> 01:59.224
It's my first memory.

01:59.281 --> 02:00.528
- A mammary memory.

02:00.591 --> 02:03.567
- I knew I had to conquer it.

02:03.632 --> 02:05.521
I knew that as a baby.

02:07.248 --> 02:08.431
Let's, um...

02:08.496 --> 02:10.127
let's find out what you know.

02:10.192 --> 02:15.216
All: * Twinkle,
twinkle, little star *

02:15.280 --> 02:18.384
* How I wonder *

02:18.417 --> 02:20.975
- * What you are *

02:21.039 --> 02:22.704
- You must be sick.

02:47.185 --> 02:48.048
Stop.

02:48.145 --> 02:49.840
Stop, it's a bit off.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.087
Uh, it's all right.

02:51.152 --> 02:53.040
Oboe one only.

02:55.024 --> 02:58.063
[oboe playing]

03:01.585 --> 03:03.824
No, no, stop.
All right.

03:03.889 --> 03:07.247
Your battery's--
a little bit low there.

03:07.344 --> 03:09.263
Just--again.

03:09.264 --> 03:10.127
Sorry, again.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.816
Please?

03:12.879 --> 03:15.695
[oboe playing]

03:15.759 --> 03:17.425
No, stop!

03:17.487 --> 03:18.862
Once more.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.264
This time just go for it.

03:21.328 --> 03:23.953
Have fun, do something
different, yeah?

03:24.015 --> 03:26.319
Do something good
for once, yeah?

03:26.384 --> 03:27.633
- Respectfully, Maestro,

03:27.697 --> 03:30.288
I've played it like
this for 35 years.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.752
- 35 years?

03:32.816 --> 03:34.735
Wow, that's
a long time, isn't it?

03:34.800 --> 03:36.944
At what point
in those 35 years

03:37.008 --> 03:38.735
did you begin to
develop arthritis?

03:38.800 --> 03:40.368
Now, again.

03:41.584 --> 03:42.865
Wait, wait.

03:42.927 --> 03:44.527
Where's our other oboist?

03:44.591 --> 03:46.543
The young one, the pretty one

03:46.608 --> 03:48.625
from the poster.

03:48.656 --> 03:51.600
- I--I think she went--

03:51.663 --> 03:53.103
- I'm right here.

03:56.207 --> 03:57.207
- Brilliant.

03:57.264 --> 03:59.855
Come, come on in.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.064
Mm.
Have a seat, love.

04:02.127 --> 04:03.376
- I tell you what.

04:03.439 --> 04:06.896
Miss this shot,
and I'm done for good.

04:06.961 --> 04:11.280
Make it, and I'll
leave it up to you.

04:11.343 --> 04:14.159
[classical music]

04:16.879 --> 04:18.382
Yes!

04:18.384 --> 04:19.343
Good one.

04:19.345 --> 04:20.305
A double bubble.

04:20.336 --> 04:21.487
[chuckles]

04:25.105 --> 04:26.894
Okay.

04:27.024 --> 04:28.336
[sniffing]

04:28.399 --> 04:29.937
If you say so.

04:39.343 --> 04:40.656

04:41.617 --> 04:45.264
Oh, Jesus, that's good.

rate composer,

04:51.985 --> 04:54.639

handsome devil.

[glass shattering]

05:05.968 --> 05:07.377
Well...

05:07.440 --> 05:09.297
Good old dada.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.672
- Maestro...

05:10.735 --> 05:12.815

[piano plays off-key]

05:21.487 --> 05:22.608
- Do it again.

05:22.704 --> 05:25.295
[piano playing off-key]

05:25.360 --> 05:26.768
Ah.

05:26.832 --> 05:28.528
I don't--
no, there's something wrong

05:28.591 --> 05:29.487
with the piano you're--

05:29.552 --> 05:30.447
you're doing it wrong.

05:30.512 --> 05:31.728
I don't know.

05:31.792 --> 05:34.225
- Rodrigo, you are
suffering from amusia.

05:34.257 --> 05:36.144
- Amusia?
- Amusia.

05:36.207 --> 05:38.543
It's a rare disorder
of the inner ear

05:38.608 --> 05:41.968
that prevents your
ability to decipher pitch.

05:42.031 --> 05:43.983
It's usually associated
with some kind

05:44.048 --> 05:45.584
of blunt force
trauma to the head.

05:45.648 --> 05:49.199
- Shit, yes, yes, yes.

05:49.264 --> 05:51.408
Recently yes, I--

05:51.504 --> 05:54.543
I got cursed.

05:56.305 --> 05:57.423
- Cancel my afternoon,

05:57.487 --> 06:01.103
and reschedule
lunch with my son.

06:01.105 --> 06:04.144
[accordion music]

06:05.678 --> 06:06.704
- You have a hat?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.208
- I don't have a fucking hat.

06:08.271 --> 06:10.033
Hey, give me your hat,
and I'll piss in it.

06:10.096 --> 06:11.096
[chuckles]

06:11.120 --> 06:12.271
Eh?

06:12.336 --> 06:15.151
[warbling indistinctly]

06:20.336 --> 06:22.927
- Maestro?

06:22.992 --> 06:24.391
- What are you doing here,
Rutledge?

06:24.432 --> 06:25.711
- I--I was just teaching

06:25.776 --> 06:26.863
a lesson on Mercer, so--

06:26.927 --> 06:28.081
I was just walking
to the train now.

06:28.144 --> 06:29.295
But what are
you doing here?

06:29.360 --> 06:31.184
- I live here too.

06:31.247 --> 06:34.319
But presently,
I'm living in the moment.

06:34.384 --> 06:37.423
Simultaneously I'm composing
a little ditty called

06:37.487 --> 06:39.697
"Homage to Papa!"

06:39.759 --> 06:42.096
Go fuck yourself, papa!

06:42.158 --> 06:43.728
I love you.

06:44.975 --> 06:46.096
- Is this man bothering you?

06:46.225 --> 06:47.504
- Oh.

06:47.567 --> 06:48.463
- Bothering her?

06:48.528 --> 06:49.807
No, constable!

06:49.872 --> 06:52.367
She is bothering me!

06:53.648 --> 06:54.672
- It's fine.

06:54.735 --> 06:55.983
We're fine.

06:56.048 --> 06:59.408
- God, I wanted
to be a composer.

06:59.471 --> 07:00.687
Look at me now.

07:00.752 --> 07:03.600
I can't even compose myself.

07:03.663 --> 07:05.487
- Where did you get this thing?

07:05.552 --> 07:08.783
- It was my one
sole inheritance.

07:08.848 --> 07:11.247
That and my nose.

07:11.312 --> 07:13.838
My dad, may he rot in peace--

07:13.903 --> 07:15.312
he was a salesman.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.711
And on the rare occasions
that he used to get home,

07:17.774 --> 07:20.079
usually stinking
of Irish whiskey,

07:20.144 --> 07:22.160
would strap this thing on,

07:22.223 --> 07:26.127
and he would humiliate
the crap out of us kids.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.168
Go!

07:29.231 --> 07:31.408
Jesus, yes!

07:31.471 --> 07:33.072
Congratulations.

07:33.134 --> 07:34.031
Well done.

07:34.095 --> 07:34.992
There!

07:35.055 --> 07:36.207
- [chuckles]
- Why?

07:36.271 --> 07:39.247
Just why, why, why did I do it?

07:39.312 --> 07:40.622
Why?

07:40.687 --> 07:43.663
God, why did I willingly

07:43.728 --> 07:45.040
give away my orchestra?

07:45.103 --> 07:46.255
- I thought that you wanted

07:46.319 --> 07:47.665
to willingly give
away your orchestra.

07:47.696 --> 07:49.199
- Oh, don't be insane, woman!

07:49.262 --> 07:50.384
No!

07:50.447 --> 07:51.824
Listen, if you
get an opportunity,

07:51.887 --> 07:52.656
you seize it.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.696
You just seize
the fucking thing.

07:58.512 --> 07:59.632
- Thank God you're here.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.776
- What the hell
happened in here?

08:01.838 --> 08:03.024
- Hmm.

08:03.985 --> 08:05.103
- Constanze.

08:05.168 --> 08:06.961
Oh, how lovely to see you.

08:07.024 --> 08:09.903
There's room enough
for two in here, you know.

08:09.968 --> 08:10.968
- I bet there is.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.399
I'm gonna get
you dried off.

08:12.463 --> 08:14.447
Where's your towels?

08:14.545 --> 08:16.975
- Why did he
call you Constanze?

08:17.872 --> 08:19.471
- Can you please
get four eggs?

08:19.536 --> 08:20.848
Crack them into
a tall glass.

08:20.911 --> 08:21.968
- Sure.

08:22.031 --> 08:23.185
Why did he call you Constanze?

08:23.216 --> 08:25.103
- I hate surprises.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.312
- I did this for us.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.904
Try to keep an open mind, okay?

08:30.735 --> 08:32.816
- Jesus.

08:33.745 --> 08:36.176
[guitars strumming]

08:36.240 --> 08:37.681
You did all this?

08:39.056 --> 08:40.272
- Yeah.

08:40.335 --> 08:41.424
- There was a red--

08:41.488 --> 08:44.368
- Oh, it's--it's under there.

08:44.432 --> 08:45.775
All your stuff's here.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.624
It's accounted for.

08:48.687 --> 08:51.536
[projector whirring]

08:53.807 --> 08:55.183
- How'd you fix this?

08:55.248 --> 08:56.687
- I literally just Googled,

08:56.784 --> 08:59.246
"How do you fix
an old projector?"

08:59.312 --> 09:00.625
- Who are you?

09:00.655 --> 09:03.120
- Come on, I want
to show you something.

09:04.687 --> 09:06.384
- Darling, the tomato juice.

09:06.416 --> 09:07.567
- Yes.

09:07.631 --> 09:10.225
Got that.
I got the coconut, ginger.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.272
- Bananas and sanka.

09:12.336 --> 09:14.672
It's a disgusting concoction,

09:14.735 --> 09:16.144
but it works every time.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.486
- Asparagus.
- Oh, I thought

09:17.552 --> 09:18.735
we omitted the asparagus,

09:18.865 --> 09:21.135
'cause you hate
the way my pee smells.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.216
- I should probably
actually get going.

09:23.279 --> 09:27.120
Um, but,
it's really nice to run into you

09:27.182 --> 09:29.039
and stuff--

09:30.384 --> 09:31.886
Bye, Maestro.

09:38.991 --> 09:41.423
- You know,
Thomas and I go

09:41.486 --> 09:43.888
really far back.

09:43.951 --> 09:44.951
- Like you said,

09:45.008 --> 09:47.984
"Conductors are
very complicated."

09:48.048 --> 09:49.231
- Yes.

09:49.296 --> 09:50.351
So are cellists.

09:50.414 --> 09:51.342
- Evidently.

09:51.408 --> 09:54.062
So are oboists.

- Uh, um...

10:13.807 --> 10:15.696
- Tape player--oh.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.615
- Testing, testing,
one, two, three.

10:21.679 --> 10:22.416
- Is that you?

10:22.480 --> 10:24.048
- This is Bradford Sharp.

10:24.144 --> 10:25.168
- [laughs]

10:25.231 --> 10:27.375
A podcaster's born.

10:27.440 --> 10:28.440
- Daddy.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.032
- Yes?

10:30.096 --> 10:31.727
- Did you go to work?

10:31.825 --> 10:33.648
- I did go to work.

10:33.745 --> 10:35.919
- Did you fly in a jetpack

10:35.984 --> 10:37.296
and hit a building?

10:37.359 --> 10:38.672
- No, I did not

10:38.735 --> 10:39.735
fly in a jetpack.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.744
I drove in my car.

10:42.672 --> 10:44.207
- Did you fall from a plane?

10:44.304 --> 10:47.279
- [laughs]
I did not.

10:47.344 --> 10:49.264
Next question.

10:49.327 --> 10:51.344
- Can I drink soda?

10:51.408 --> 10:52.751
- No!

10:52.815 --> 10:54.447
Good try, though.

10:56.207 --> 10:57.775
- I am...

11:00.368 --> 11:03.696
I wish I'd gotten
a chance to meet him.

11:07.727 --> 11:09.264
I'm sorry
I gave you a hard time

11:09.327 --> 11:11.216
about having so much stuff.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.327
Fuck, say something...

11:22.511 --> 11:23.534
Anything.

11:23.664 --> 11:25.231
- [sighs]

11:27.504 --> 11:29.552
What's the word for--

11:31.375 --> 11:32.304
For this?

11:32.336 --> 11:33.648
- Oh.

11:35.471 --> 11:37.615
- You know, we'd settle
for no reduction in pension

11:37.679 --> 11:39.759
and a slight raise
in health care

11:39.822 --> 11:40.945
and base pay.

11:40.975 --> 11:42.415
Sounds reasonable, doesn't it?

11:42.480 --> 11:44.080
- It's reasonable,
but, you know,

11:44.144 --> 11:46.701
you got to get past
all this bullshit.

11:46.703 --> 11:50.063
The lawyers and Bibens
and Union Bobs.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.504
You got to sit down

11:51.567 --> 11:53.231
and talk woman to woman.

11:53.294 --> 11:54.607
- With you?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.207
- No, dear.
Not with me.

Don't be cheeky.

and two seats in.

12:04.303 --> 12:06.447
- Okay.
- Welcome.

12:06.511 --> 12:08.336
Enjoy the show.

12:08.399 --> 12:10.703
Enjoy the concert.

12:10.735 --> 12:12.816
Enjoy the--Maestro.

12:12.879 --> 12:14.222
- Yes, yes--
I know

12:14.287 --> 12:15.663
it's kind of funny, right?

12:15.727 --> 12:17.198
It's funny, but I just
came as a civilian.

12:17.263 --> 12:18.511
Just treat me
like a normal audience.

12:18.576 --> 12:19.695
Like a normal audience,
like a--

12:19.759 --> 12:22.351
- Oh, hope it's
nothing permanent.

12:23.567 --> 12:25.615
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

12:25.679 --> 12:27.344
- Thank you.

12:30.192 --> 12:31.567
- Gabrielle, teacher.

12:31.631 --> 12:32.527
You know what?

12:32.591 --> 12:33.775
I'm gonna go backstage

12:33.840 --> 12:36.240
to talk with Lennox
and my orchestra,

12:36.302 --> 12:37.326
wish them good luck.

12:37.392 --> 12:39.567
I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

12:39.631 --> 12:41.294
- I'll be back.

12:41.423 --> 12:44.174
[oboe music]

12:46.543 --> 12:47.543
- Stop.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.838
That was sweet

12:49.903 --> 12:52.527
like cake,
like birthday cake.

12:53.678 --> 12:55.567
I fucking hate birthday cake,

12:55.631 --> 12:56.654
always shite.

12:56.783 --> 12:57.783
I want a steak.

12:57.840 --> 12:58.840
I want meat.

12:58.864 --> 12:59.919
How hard is this?

12:59.984 --> 13:02.191
It's off, it's wrong, yeah?

13:02.255 --> 13:04.047
I mean, fucking hell.

13:04.110 --> 13:05.456
Where's arthritic Betty Cragdale
when I need her?

13:05.519 --> 13:06.703
- Hey, that--that's enough.

13:06.768 --> 13:08.399
It's almost time
for the performance.

13:08.464 --> 13:09.703
- I'll you
what time it is, Bob.

13:09.744 --> 13:11.408
It's time for you
to take your flute

13:11.471 --> 13:13.168
and learn how to play
it better, all right?

13:13.231 --> 13:14.543
Much better!

13:14.606 --> 13:15.888
Better than you're
playing it now, Bob!

13:15.984 --> 13:16.984
- Lennox, Lennox.

13:17.039 --> 13:18.639
Hey, come--

13:18.702 --> 13:20.399
Come. Hello.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.216
- All right, take five.

13:23.279 --> 13:24.687
Off to the toilet Bob, yeah?

13:24.751 --> 13:26.126
- Take ten.

13:27.504 --> 13:28.879
- Sorry got a bit vexed, yeah?

13:28.943 --> 13:30.381
But I don't like what
I'm hearing in there.

13:30.384 --> 13:31.663
- Yeah, yeah, no,
me too, me too.

13:31.727 --> 13:32.942
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

13:33.006 --> 13:35.183
- I just want the short
cadenza for solo oboe

13:35.248 --> 13:36.816
in the first movement
to be played quickly!

13:36.879 --> 13:38.767
- Yeah, but that's just, like,
your interpretation, man.

13:38.831 --> 13:40.048
- It should be brisk.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.647
- Well, you can earn
that, you know?

13:41.711 --> 13:43.440
If you let the oboe breathe
a little bit more--

13:43.503 --> 13:44.847
You know, you let it flow,

13:44.912 --> 13:46.320
then you can--
you can let the orchestra

13:46.383 --> 13:48.240
then later come in
with all its anger and fury.

13:48.302 --> 13:50.927
- Anger and fury,
that's what I like, mate.

13:50.990 --> 13:51.792
That's who I am.

13:51.855 --> 13:53.552
That's my brand.
You get me?

13:53.615 --> 13:56.302
Anger and fury is Lennox.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.095
But those old-age
pensioners in there--

13:58.224 --> 14:00.528
their brand
is no discipline, no focus,

14:00.591 --> 14:02.062
and constantly asking
to go to the potty.

14:02.063 --> 14:03.152
- I know, I know--

14:03.216 --> 14:04.144
- The pack of spoiled
little brats, man.

14:04.207 --> 14:06.096
- I know--yes, they are,

14:06.158 --> 14:07.375
but that's my orchestra
you're talking about.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.975
And you're just treating
them like shit, yes.

14:09.038 --> 14:10.575
My orchestra--
you're treating them like shit

14:10.703 --> 14:12.366
and they don't deserve
to be treated like that, okay?

14:12.432 --> 14:13.967
Ludwig doesn't deserve
to be treated like that.

14:14.030 --> 14:15.792
And don't ever talk
to the oboe like that.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.102
You know what?
I'm going to fire you.

14:17.167 --> 14:18.254
I'm gonna fire you,
fire, fire--

14:18.384 --> 14:19.342
- Fire, fire?
- Fire.

14:19.345 --> 14:20.687
- You can't fucking fire me.

14:20.750 --> 14:21.456
- Lennox, I can.

14:21.519 --> 14:22.671
Yes, because you know what?

14:22.735 --> 14:23.630
It's in my contract,

14:23.696 --> 14:24.912
and that is my red tape.

14:24.975 --> 14:26.288
And you cannot cut
that red tape.

14:26.351 --> 14:28.207
I can cut it, but you
cannot cut it, okay?

14:28.272 --> 14:30.032
You can't cut that
red tape--you're fired!

14:30.096 --> 14:31.726
- Pissing me--
like I need any of this.

14:31.823 --> 14:33.456
Man, fuck this shit!

14:34.799 --> 14:36.495
- Did Rodrigo actually
just fire him?

14:36.624 --> 14:38.191
- Yes, and I need your help.

14:38.255 --> 14:39.342
- What? No.

14:39.407 --> 14:40.879
You are Rodrigo's
assistant now.

14:40.943 --> 14:42.384
This is way too
complicated for me.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.567
I told you this
is your job now.

14:43.631 --> 14:45.264
- He can't conduct.

14:45.296 --> 14:47.855
- What do you mean?
He can conduct Beethoven's
"Fifth" in his sleep.

14:47.918 --> 14:49.903
- He couldn't even conduct
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."

14:49.966 --> 14:52.015
And he was wide awake.

14:52.080 --> 14:55.695
[high-pitch ringing]

14:55.823 --> 14:57.519
- You think you
have hearing problems?

14:57.582 --> 14:59.663
I can't hear scheisse!

14:59.696 --> 15:01.008
- Ludwig.

15:01.071 --> 15:03.567
- I composed most
of my "Ninth Symphony"

15:03.631 --> 15:04.943
in complete silence.

15:05.006 --> 15:06.768
Imagine that,
writing an ode to joy,

15:06.831 --> 15:08.558
while I was in
complete despair.

15:08.624 --> 15:11.023
On--in 1824,
my hearing

15:11.086 --> 15:14.480
was completely
nonexistent, but...

15:14.543 --> 15:15.567
I conducted.

15:15.630 --> 15:16.630
- I know. I know.

15:16.655 --> 15:17.551
I always wanted to ask you,

15:17.615 --> 15:18.615
how did it go?

15:18.639 --> 15:19.822
- Dreadfully.

15:19.823 --> 15:21.552
I couldn't hear
the orchestra at all.

15:21.615 --> 15:22.615
My count was off,

15:22.703 --> 15:23.822
but I continued to conduct

15:23.888 --> 15:25.296
even after the Symphony
had concluded.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.182
- And everybody noticed?
- Oh, everybody knew.

15:27.246 --> 15:28.591
- Ah, that's horrible.

15:28.655 --> 15:29.966
Why are you telling
me these things?

15:30.030 --> 15:30.927
Why?

15:30.990 --> 15:32.174
- It's a good question.

15:32.303 --> 15:34.320
You don't even exist.

15:34.383 --> 15:36.144
- Who are you talking to?

15:37.296 --> 15:39.822
- Just to Ludwig.

15:39.886 --> 15:41.902
- Mike told me.

15:41.903 --> 15:43.440
- About the...
- Mm-hmm.

15:43.503 --> 15:44.942
- Oh, my God, no, no,
it's gonna be terrible.

15:45.008 --> 15:46.159
It's gonna be
tremendously horrible.

15:46.224 --> 15:47.375
Yes, I should have
stayed in Mexico.

15:47.438 --> 15:48.751
I should have listened--

15:48.816 --> 15:52.047
- No, Mexico was a fantasy--
that was a fantasy, okay?

15:52.110 --> 15:53.167
- A fantasy?

15:53.230 --> 15:54.126
- No one will know

15:54.191 --> 15:55.191
as far as tonight goes.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.134
I promise you.

15:57.264 --> 15:59.438
At least no one
in the audience.

16:04.207 --> 16:07.248
[crowd chattering,
instruments tuning]

16:19.056 --> 16:21.102
- Ladies and gentlemen, there's
a change in the program.

16:21.167 --> 16:22.927
Tonight's performance
will be conducted

16:22.990 --> 16:25.870
by our very own Maestro,

Hey, hey.

- Hey.
- Thank you so much.

18:42.926 --> 18:44.111
Thank you
because I know that you--

18:44.174 --> 18:45.134
you and Warren Boyd and Michel,

18:45.263 --> 18:46.095
you guys worked it out.

18:46.223 --> 18:47.182
- Of course.

18:47.184 --> 18:48.654
- Came out okay, right?
- Yeah.

18:48.719 --> 18:50.414
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:50.479 --> 18:52.398
I also--

18:52.463 --> 18:53.903
I just wanted to say

18:53.935 --> 18:56.462
that the orchestra
really loves you.

18:56.527 --> 18:57.743
I'm not saying that as, like,

18:57.807 --> 18:59.247
some kind of cheesy metaphor.

18:59.310 --> 19:00.974
It's just--it's true.

19:01.038 --> 19:03.503
- Me too.

19:03.567 --> 19:04.567
Me too, I love--

19:04.623 --> 19:05.999
I love the orchestra as well.

19:06.063 --> 19:07.886
- Can you help them?

19:13.615 --> 19:15.855
- I'll try.

19:15.919 --> 19:18.000
- Ah, come in, Cynthia.

19:19.056 --> 19:20.976
Listen, I wanted you two
to get together

19:21.038 --> 19:23.663
because you're the two people
that I love the most

19:23.727 --> 19:25.646
in this planet.

19:25.711 --> 19:28.239
- Cynthia, I want to apologize

19:28.303 --> 19:30.030
for the article in "The Post."

19:30.095 --> 19:31.790
It won't happen again.

19:31.855 --> 19:33.934
Just trust me.

19:35.663 --> 19:37.231
- Glad to hear it.

19:38.318 --> 19:41.391
- How about we cut
through all the bullshit.

19:41.454 --> 19:43.727
- So I know you've got
important things to discuss,

19:43.790 --> 19:45.358
but one suggestion,

19:45.423 --> 19:47.567
please...

- I did it.

19:58.959 --> 20:00.144
It's settled.

20:00.207 --> 20:03.021
I mean, not settled,
settled, not yet.

20:03.023 --> 20:05.487
But I spoke to Gloria,
and she's cool.

20:05.550 --> 20:09.071
We--we're cool.
Major progress was made.

20:09.134 --> 20:11.471
- Please don't go
behind my back

20:11.535 --> 20:12.535
and try to negotiate.

20:12.624 --> 20:14.446
They'll eat you alive.

20:14.544 --> 20:16.143
Anyway, Gloria doesn't
have any power.

20:16.207 --> 20:17.487
- She's the Head of the Board.

20:17.551 --> 20:18.990
- No, Biben's got all the votes.

20:19.055 --> 20:21.647
Look, this is a gutter fight.

20:21.711 --> 20:22.990
Well, thankfully,

20:23.055 --> 20:25.102
I have some news too.

20:25.104 --> 20:26.287
Here are some facts

20:26.352 --> 20:27.663
you'll find interesting.

20:37.934 --> 20:39.247
- Have you given this to anyone?

20:39.310 --> 20:40.847
- "The Times."

20:42.511 --> 20:44.173
What?
- What do you mean, "what?"

20:44.304 --> 20:46.030
You've ruined everything.

20:46.094 --> 20:47.631
Gloria's gonna lose her shit.

20:47.694 --> 20:49.454
- Let me do my job.

20:49.519 --> 20:50.414
- Your job?

20:50.479 --> 20:52.143
No, your job
is you work for me.

20:52.207 --> 20:55.022
Nina, you work for us,
the orchestra.

20:55.086 --> 20:56.527
You had no right.

20:56.590 --> 20:58.191
- Cynthia,
let me ask you something.

20:58.255 --> 21:01.358
What if I sat in
with the orchestra sometime,

21:01.423 --> 21:02.544
tried to play cello.

21:02.606 --> 21:03.919
How do you think that would go?

21:03.982 --> 21:05.711
Not good, right?

21:05.775 --> 21:08.173
Because I don't play cello.

21:08.304 --> 21:09.903
So don't you try
to come into my office

21:09.967 --> 21:11.279
and think you can do
what I do.

21:11.343 --> 21:12.623
- No, I don't think
I can do what you do,

21:12.686 --> 21:14.702
but I can damn well
do my version of it.

21:14.767 --> 21:17.262
You--you're on to some other
city as soon as this is over.

21:17.327 --> 21:19.056
- You think that
as soon as I seal the deal

21:19.118 --> 21:21.935
on these negotiations, that I'm
gonna move onto someone else?

21:21.999 --> 21:24.270
- You have one hell
of a fucking ego.

21:24.335 --> 21:26.063
The orchestra is my family.

21:26.126 --> 21:28.463
I won't let anyone
or anything hurt it.

21:30.063 --> 21:31.086
You're fired.

21:31.151 --> 21:32.173
- What?

21:32.304 --> 21:34.511
- I don't trust you, sorry.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.502
- Cynthia...

21:42.000 --> 21:43.248
Go fuck yourself.

21:43.310 --> 21:44.942
- I intend to

21:45.007 --> 21:47.182
for the foreseeable future.

21:47.247 --> 21:50.126
[classical music]

21:59.279 --> 22:01.838
- I'm really sorry about
the whole Lennox thing.

22:01.903 --> 22:03.215
- Laws of the jungle, baby.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.398
Besides you're my student.

22:04.462 --> 22:06.159
I can't make you
better than I am,

22:06.222 --> 22:07.663
maybe I'm a terrible teacher.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.614
- You're an amazing teacher.

22:09.743 --> 22:11.663
- Reg?

22:15.536 --> 22:17.198
- [chuckles]
Hello.

22:17.262 --> 22:18.384
- Hailey, this is Reg.

22:18.446 --> 22:20.336
Reg was my student too.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.871
Now he's first chair

22:21.934 --> 22:22.702
with the Des Moines Phil.

22:22.767 --> 22:25.104
- Oh, wow.

22:25.166 --> 22:26.256
- He was at the concert
last night

22:26.318 --> 22:27.343
and heard you play.

22:27.406 --> 22:28.943
He thought he was going
to hear me.

22:29.007 --> 22:30.192
- Betty said you were great.

22:30.255 --> 22:32.302
The articulation,
the placement--

22:32.366 --> 22:34.703
You have such a naturally
flexible soft palate.

22:34.734 --> 22:36.015
It's wonderful.

22:36.078 --> 22:37.391
- He's right.

22:37.453 --> 22:39.214
You play beautifully.

22:40.334 --> 22:41.262
- Hailey,

22:41.326 --> 22:42.542
we're about to lose

22:42.606 --> 22:44.496
our second chair oboist.

22:44.558 --> 22:46.734
The job is yours
if you want it.

22:46.798 --> 22:48.240
- Wow--

22:48.302 --> 22:49.550
- Truth be told,

22:49.615 --> 22:51.055
we do do a lot of pops.

22:51.119 --> 22:52.366
But sometimes we manage

22:52.431 --> 22:54.126
to sneak in a little Sibelius.

22:54.192 --> 22:56.557
- I am so flattered, truly.

22:56.623 --> 22:58.318
Like, this is a dream job

22:58.383 --> 22:59.438
for some people.

22:59.502 --> 23:00.622
It's just that I've spent

23:00.624 --> 23:02.446
a lot of time trying
get where I am

23:02.544 --> 23:04.238
in New York,
and I--I just think

23:04.303 --> 23:06.510
I should stay here, so...

23:06.576 --> 23:07.615
- You know there's no need

23:07.663 --> 23:09.007
to give me final
answer right now.

23:09.070 --> 23:11.502
Just think on it.

23:11.567 --> 23:12.686
- Okay.

23:12.750 --> 23:13.871
- Reg, darling.

23:13.933 --> 23:15.663
Won't you scoot that sexy ass

23:15.727 --> 23:17.262
to the kitchen and whip me up

23:17.326 --> 23:19.535
an Iowa omelet?

23:24.431 --> 23:26.544
- You goddess, you.

23:27.599 --> 23:29.422
- Look, Hailey,
I'd like to play BFF

23:29.423 --> 23:30.423
with you all day long--

23:30.480 --> 23:31.759
braid each other's hair,

23:31.823 --> 23:33.807
prank phone call
the percussionists, the works--

23:33.871 --> 23:35.086
but the truth is,

23:35.183 --> 23:37.391
Des Moines isn't
your choice to make.

23:37.454 --> 23:39.023
- Wait, what?

23:39.086 --> 23:40.750
- If you don't
take that Iowa job,

23:40.814 --> 23:43.471
I'll make sure everyone knows
about your Mexican tryst.

23:44.942 --> 23:47.310
Not good for you
or the Maestro.

23:47.375 --> 23:48.846
[classical music]

23:48.911 --> 23:50.095
Like I said, that jungle...

23:51.503 --> 23:53.038
She's a bitch.
