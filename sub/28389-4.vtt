WEBVTT

00:09.806 --> 00:12.959
What a fine potpourri of guests.

00:12.960 --> 00:15.953
Are you sure you don't want anything
else to eat?

00:15.954 --> 00:16.952
Dancers don't eat.

00:16.953 --> 00:18.308
Hungover, honey.
No, thanks.

00:18.309 --> 00:21.462
Go on then, perhaps a side clump
of cheese. Breakfast like a king.

00:21.463 --> 00:24.934
Yes, not "Breakfast like a bunch of
big fat greedy hippos."

00:24.935 --> 00:26.451
Said with love.

00:26.452 --> 00:27.968
Hah, she's a terrier.

00:27.969 --> 00:30.922
Cuppa char for the workers, missus?

00:30.923 --> 00:32.918
You!
SHE CHUCKLES

00:32.919 --> 00:35.113
Leslie has been teaching me cockney.

00:35.114 --> 00:38.906
Spiros has been doing vital work
on Gerry's zoo, again.

00:38.907 --> 00:41.580
And other jobs,
which are also vital.

00:41.581 --> 00:43.895
KNOCK ON DOOR

00:43.896 --> 00:45.891
Kalimera, kyries kai kyrioi.

00:45.892 --> 00:47.887
Kali-whatever.
What did he say?

00:47.888 --> 00:51.879
Letter from the naughty son
in Paris.

00:51.880 --> 00:57.867
Postcard from the daughter in
Dorsetshire, not happy in her work.

00:57.868 --> 00:58.866
Don't know what that is.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.030 --> 01:17.826
I never get any post.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.184
THEY CHUCKLE

01:22.657 --> 01:24.812
Char.

01:26.808 --> 01:27.806
Shoo.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.787
Darling if you're going
to teach Spiros anything,

01:36.788 --> 01:38.782
teach him how to leave his wife.

01:38.783 --> 01:40.778
SHE LAUGHS

01:40.779 --> 01:42.774
Yes, but are you joking?

01:42.775 --> 01:45.768
Of course I am.

01:45.769 --> 01:48.962
Hmm, well, I'm disappointed.

01:48.963 --> 01:52.115
On our trip to Kalami, they seemed
ready to pack it all in.

01:52.116 --> 01:57.584
Well, divorce isn't the done thing
here. More than anywhere.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.737
Worse marriages than theirs
have lasted a lifetime.

02:00.738 --> 02:03.731
Yeah, but the difference is you two
want to be together, and should be.

02:03.732 --> 02:08.243
Well... let's just be grateful for
having him around the house.

02:56.623 --> 02:57.621
I used to be fairly annoying,

02:57.622 --> 03:00.614
but you are an absolute genius
at it.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.292
Eight times seven?

03:04.607 --> 03:06.602
Seven.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.599
You'll hurt your eyes if you stare
at me that hard.

03:10.595 --> 03:11.593
You're not a proper teacher.

03:11.594 --> 03:13.627
Well, you're not a proper child.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.584
Good.

03:17.421 --> 03:19.575
We're popping out for some victuals.

03:19.576 --> 03:21.571
You do that, Geoff.

03:21.572 --> 03:24.565
It's Geoffrey. We don't foreshorten.

03:24.566 --> 03:25.564
Thanks.

03:26.602 --> 03:28.557
Prunella.

03:28.558 --> 03:32.548
It's Prue. Or Prudence. Or Ma'am.

03:32.549 --> 03:33.907
She's teasing, Auntie.

03:40.533 --> 03:42.529
Well, I get paid even if we do
nothing.

03:48.517 --> 03:51.509
I love Margo,
but she spells like a lunatic,

03:51.510 --> 03:52.508
and thinks Africa's a country.

03:52.509 --> 03:54.503
Well, it doesn't matter,

03:54.504 --> 03:56.499
because her mopey pupil doesn't care
what Africa is,

03:56.500 --> 03:58.495
or if it's spelt at all.

03:58.496 --> 04:00.491
Margo's tough,
I'm sure she'll break her,

04:00.492 --> 04:03.486
like a strong mare wrestling a
troubled young pony into submission.

04:05.482 --> 04:07.477
Perfectly normal image.

04:07.478 --> 04:11.468
Louisa, cup of tea? Appointment?
Quick hysterectomy?

04:11.469 --> 04:15.460
I must get back to my guests.
With their medical supplies.

04:15.461 --> 04:18.494
Ah, Countess De Torro,
more ointment for her erysipelas.

04:18.495 --> 04:22.446
Lumis and Harry need
petroleum jelly, don't ask.

04:22.447 --> 04:23.644
And our dancer Veronica...

04:24.642 --> 04:27.117
..I'm too embarrassed
to say that out loud.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.791
No we don't stock that.

04:29.792 --> 04:32.426
You'll need to go to a shop
in Sodom or Gomorrah.

04:33.424 --> 04:37.255
I detect an air of decadence among
your household.

04:37.256 --> 04:40.249
You sound like
a Victorian magistrate.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.405
Frankly, with Europe so doom-laden,

04:42.406 --> 04:46.596
why not swim naked, or spend the day
in a hammock with your "friend"?

04:46.597 --> 04:50.388
I'm just thinking how you may be
regarded by my fellow Greeks.

04:50.389 --> 04:52.225
Especially with Spiros
in your house.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.382
He's building the zoo!

04:53.383 --> 04:54.381
Very slowly.

04:55.379 --> 04:59.370
Mind you, I did hear
that his wife's a real flirt.

04:59.371 --> 05:01.367
Hmm, that's your my-lips-are-sealed
face!

05:10.348 --> 05:12.702
'..helped by Galini,
who I spend most days with.

05:12.703 --> 05:15.337
'And not just because she looks so
nice, though that is good too.

05:15.338 --> 05:19.329
'We are planning to stay up
the whole night watching badgers.

05:19.330 --> 05:22.164
'Lots of love, Gerry.'

05:29.988 --> 05:33.979
'Dear Gerry. I write this in
immediate reply before I forget

05:33.980 --> 05:37.292
'what's in your letter,
as I am generally consumed with me,

05:37.293 --> 05:39.288
'but you know that.

05:39.289 --> 05:41.962
'You and Galini sound like a match
made in zoic.

05:41.963 --> 05:43.280
'Look it up.'

05:43.281 --> 05:44.279
DOG BARKS

05:47.272 --> 05:49.268
No, Roger, that's for Galini.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.262
She loves beetles.

05:54.258 --> 05:56.254
PEOPLE SPEAK IN GREEK

06:03.240 --> 06:04.237
Hello.

06:05.754 --> 06:06.912
Hello.

06:09.227 --> 06:10.584
What is in your hand?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.216
Just some matches.

06:14.217 --> 06:18.249
I might go and get some...
smokes later, so...

06:25.873 --> 06:28.187
My friend has a new motorbike.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.183
Yes, yes.

06:30.184 --> 06:33.178
Well, let's hope he doesn't
fall off it and die.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.201
Oh, little bastard's eaten
all of my matches.

06:43.157 --> 06:44.195
Anyway, I've got to, erm...

06:46.151 --> 06:47.149
..go.

07:03.116 --> 07:06.109
RAT SQUEAKS

07:06.110 --> 07:07.108
Oh shut up.

07:10.142 --> 07:12.097
KNOCK ON DOOR.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.096
I'll be down later.

07:13.097 --> 07:15.091
It's your friendly local parent.

07:15.092 --> 07:16.768
And her perky handyman.

07:21.079 --> 07:22.077
What's wrong?

07:22.078 --> 07:24.072
Nothing you can help with.

07:24.073 --> 07:26.068
Has something escaped?

07:26.069 --> 07:28.064
You were so upset when your mink
burrowed to freedom.

07:28.065 --> 07:31.058
There's more to me than animals,
you know.

07:31.059 --> 07:32.057
Is there?

07:33.055 --> 07:38.044
No I mean I know there is but...
that's your life.

07:38.045 --> 07:40.039
You know they're hungry downstairs.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.038
You feed them.

07:41.039 --> 07:43.233
Come into town with me.
I'll buy you a lolly.

07:43.234 --> 07:45.029
Don't want a bloody lolly.

07:45.030 --> 07:46.028
You love a lolly.

07:46.029 --> 07:48.024
Well, I'm not loving a lolly
any more.

07:58.003 --> 07:59.001
GERRY SIGHS

08:04.989 --> 08:06.985
KNOCK ON DOOR

08:15.967 --> 08:18.959
Hello, Margo.
How was my angel today?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.955
Oh, you know Maud!

08:20.956 --> 08:21.954
What did you study?

08:21.954 --> 08:22.952
Don't go on, you old fool.

08:24.948 --> 08:28.939
Um, I'm taking Maud's siblings away
on a trip, so,

08:28.940 --> 08:30.935
I'd really appreciate it if
you and your aunt and uncle

08:30.936 --> 08:32.931
would look after her for a week.

08:32.932 --> 08:33.929
No that's not a good idea.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.924
All expenses and double
your weekly rate.

08:38.919 --> 08:39.917
Sit her in a corner with a book.

08:39.918 --> 08:41.115
For a week?

08:43.749 --> 08:44.906
Oh, thank you so much!

08:44.907 --> 08:47.900
Maud, Miss Durrell would love
to have you for the week.

08:47.901 --> 08:49.896
She'll come tomorrow
with her jim-jams.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.893
And a new cheerful attitude.

08:54.886 --> 08:55.884
Ugh.

09:03.908 --> 09:05.903
I love having Spiros here.

09:05.904 --> 09:07.859
He's brilliant around the house.

09:07.860 --> 09:08.898
I know.

09:12.051 --> 09:16.840
Florence says his Dimitra
has a roving eye.

09:16.841 --> 09:20.034
Hmm. Can Dr Petridis fix it?

09:20.035 --> 09:21.191
What?

09:21.192 --> 09:23.826
Oh, no,
you're thinking of a lazy eye.

09:23.827 --> 09:24.825
It's the opposite.

09:24.826 --> 09:26.821
Uh, the opposite eye?

09:27.819 --> 09:29.814
No, the opposite of lazy.

09:29.815 --> 09:32.808
Hard-working?
Spiros' wife has a hard-working eye?

09:32.809 --> 09:35.801
No, she's interested in other men!

09:35.802 --> 09:36.800
All right!

09:37.798 --> 09:40.791
Oh, gosh.
I wonder what Spiros thinks.

09:40.792 --> 09:43.825
I suspect he turns a blind eye,
for the sake of his children.

09:43.826 --> 09:46.779
Mm. Do you think she
actually has affairs?

09:46.780 --> 09:49.773
I doubt it, otherwise why would
Spiros stay with her.

09:49.774 --> 09:51.769
Much like Germany vis-a-vis Austria,

09:51.770 --> 09:55.601
the two big American sissies have
annexed the hammock.

09:55.602 --> 09:56.758
Maybe we should have a rota.

09:56.759 --> 10:00.112
Yes good, good,
you organise that, Basil.

10:03.745 --> 10:05.740
Another warm one.

10:05.741 --> 10:09.572
One's thoughts
take a turn to the physical.

10:09.573 --> 10:11.568
I suggested to Veronica that...

10:11.569 --> 10:13.724
she and I might get to know
each other better.

10:14.722 --> 10:15.720
What did she say?

10:15.721 --> 10:17.715
Well, I think her exact words
were, er,

10:17.716 --> 10:20.710
"No. No. God, no.
Why would I do that?"

10:22.706 --> 10:26.377
# Let me call you sweetheart

10:26.378 --> 10:29.692
# Because I love you... #

10:35.679 --> 10:36.677
Ooh!

10:39.671 --> 10:44.181
Oh, Gerry, your room smells again,
please bathe your locusts,

10:44.182 --> 10:47.654
or sprinkle them with cologne,
or something.

10:47.655 --> 10:48.653
SHE SIGHS

10:48.654 --> 10:50.488
Rude.

10:50.489 --> 10:51.645
Whoa, that's a monster!

10:51.646 --> 10:52.644
HE CHUCKLES

10:52.645 --> 10:55.637
You don't send in a boy's tool
to do a man's job.

10:55.638 --> 10:57.633
It's how you use it,
though, isn't it?

10:57.634 --> 10:59.629
That is so true.
THEY GIGGLE

10:59.630 --> 11:02.624
You two are scrumptious together.

11:16.595 --> 11:18.271
Evening, Basil.

11:18.272 --> 11:19.588
Evening.

11:19.589 --> 11:21.584
I was just mulling over what you
said earlier,

11:21.585 --> 11:23.580
about you not having a lady in your
life.

11:23.581 --> 11:24.619
HE SIGHS

11:26.095 --> 11:28.250
HE GROANS

11:28.251 --> 11:29.568
Well,

11:30.566 --> 11:32.601
you must've noticed Mrs Hakaiopulos
taking a shine to you,

11:32.602 --> 11:34.557
when we went to Kalami.

11:34.558 --> 11:35.556
Do you think she did?

11:36.554 --> 11:39.548
And her marriage with Spiros is
pretty much over, as you could tell.

11:41.544 --> 11:42.740
You should call on her.

11:42.741 --> 11:44.537
Go a'courting.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.536
I'm...

11:46.533 --> 11:51.522
..not in the habit
of seducing married women.

11:51.523 --> 11:53.518
So, it's time you gave it a go.

11:53.519 --> 11:54.517
She is a...

11:55.515 --> 11:58.508
..very attractive woman.

11:58.509 --> 11:59.507
She is.

12:00.704 --> 12:02.501
And...

12:03.499 --> 12:04.536
..you're a very attractive man.

12:08.488 --> 12:11.681
I am. That's sometimes forgotten.

12:11.682 --> 12:13.836
Not by Dimitra, that's for sure.

12:13.837 --> 12:15.513
And you'd be doing us all a service.

12:15.514 --> 12:20.463
Her, you, and Spiros, because he's
clearly had enough of the marriage.

12:20.464 --> 12:21.462
All right.

12:21.463 --> 12:23.458
I will give it a go.

12:42.419 --> 12:45.412
This is rather uncharted territory
for me.

12:46.410 --> 12:48.406
You must've chatted women up before.

12:49.404 --> 12:51.399
No, they tend to make the running.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.754
"Come on Basil, how about it?"
kind of thing.

12:53.755 --> 12:56.389
Then we break up shortly afterwards.

12:56.390 --> 12:58.385
It's not complicated.

12:58.386 --> 13:02.376
Just go up to her, compliment,
compliment, smiley, smile, smile,

13:02.377 --> 13:04.891
can I come in for a glass of water?

13:04.892 --> 13:06.368
Bob's your uncle.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.364
What if Spiros comes home?

13:08.365 --> 13:09.881
He won't,
he's at our house all the hours,

13:09.882 --> 13:11.718
and he said his kids are away
with their granny.

13:13.395 --> 13:16.349
She's lonely, look.

13:40.299 --> 13:41.297
Dimitra!

13:41.298 --> 13:43.292
Basil!

13:43.293 --> 13:45.288
What can I do for you?

13:45.289 --> 13:46.287
Oh, look at you!

13:46.288 --> 13:47.485
SHE LAUGHS

13:50.279 --> 13:52.275
Come in!

13:58.781 --> 14:01.256
MUSIC: 'Yes Indeed' by Count Basie

14:17.583 --> 14:19.419
SHE MUTTERS IN GREEK

14:21.215 --> 14:22.891
Oh!
Cheers!

14:22.892 --> 14:24.209
Hello? Hello?

14:35.187 --> 14:36.185
THEY SPEAK GREEK

14:37.182 --> 14:38.859
Kalimera.

14:53.828 --> 14:55.146
THEY SPEAK GREEK

15:01.133 --> 15:04.326
Pavlos, I'm being ignored,
do you know why?

15:04.327 --> 15:07.120
Hello, Mrs Durrell. What?

15:07.121 --> 15:09.116
They won't serve me.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.115
Oh, well.

15:10.116 --> 15:12.309
Oh, well? Why won't they?

15:12.310 --> 15:14.107
They are closing for lunch.

15:15.104 --> 15:17.099
No, they're not.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.096
I must go to ring the bells.

15:22.090 --> 15:24.085
Is it because I'm British?

15:24.086 --> 15:26.081
Hope to see you in church.

15:26.082 --> 15:29.275
If I give you some money
will you buy me a cucumber?

15:39.055 --> 15:42.048
If that's supposed to be amusing,
it isn't working.

15:42.049 --> 15:43.566
It's not supposed to be anything.

15:46.041 --> 15:50.032
Your mother's paying for my time.
Do you hate her so much?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.709
I would if I could be bothered.

15:54.024 --> 15:57.017
The trickier you are,
the more isolated you'll become,

15:57.018 --> 15:59.014
and the sadder you'll get.

16:01.050 --> 16:02.367
SHE SIGHS

16:08.994 --> 16:11.508
SHE GASPS

16:15.979 --> 16:17.495
What do you think you're doing?

16:17.496 --> 16:18.972
I have the same question for you.

16:18.973 --> 16:21.967
SHE CRIES

16:24.322 --> 16:26.637
I think we need to get out
the house, don't you?

16:29.951 --> 16:32.784
'Dorset seems boring,

16:32.785 --> 16:36.935
'but look closer and it's unhinged,
I'm flipping telling you.

16:36.936 --> 16:39.929
'Prue and Geoffrey speak in their
own tongue, which I call Prueffrey,

16:39.930 --> 16:42.923
'and my devil-pupil, Maud
is from another planet,

16:42.924 --> 16:47.914
'e.g. the dark side of the Moon...
if the Moon is a planet.

16:49.909 --> 16:52.744
'Must go, you lovely man. M.'

16:54.899 --> 16:56.894
'Margo, dearest.

16:56.895 --> 16:58.890
'I thought was an ambitious
literary stylist,

16:58.891 --> 17:01.884
'but you bring a peerless
set of quirks to the genre.

17:01.885 --> 17:03.880
'You make a strong case
for the home counties,

17:03.881 --> 17:08.550
'but I have Paris in the spring,
which glitters and hums.'

17:10.906 --> 17:12.861
There's nothing else to do.

17:12.862 --> 17:14.858
It's this or watch them
painting the bus stop.

17:16.854 --> 17:17.852
Come on.

17:32.662 --> 17:33.818
What happens now?

17:33.819 --> 17:37.810
I dunno,
I've never been to a cinema either.

17:37.811 --> 17:40.805
FILM MUSIC STARTS

17:44.797 --> 17:47.151
What do you mean we're immoral?

17:47.152 --> 17:48.787
I don't think you are,

17:48.788 --> 17:50.783
but Greeks can be very conservative,
you know that.

17:50.784 --> 17:52.619
I, I tried to warn you.

17:52.620 --> 17:55.773
So, what is it exactly that these
killjoys are objecting to?

17:55.774 --> 17:57.809
I suppose it's a combination
of the skinny-dipping,

17:57.810 --> 18:00.443
and your countess who keeps taking
off her wig.

18:00.444 --> 18:01.761
Well it's hot, for a wig.

18:01.762 --> 18:04.276
I know, but also a succession of
louche guests,

18:04.277 --> 18:07.748
including an explosive Armenian
poet, a gun-toting colonel,

18:07.749 --> 18:11.101
and your charming,
if homosexual, Americans.

18:11.102 --> 18:12.738
Plus, you being close to Spiros.

18:12.739 --> 18:14.734
You slipped that one in quickly.

18:14.735 --> 18:17.728
Not my opinion, as I say,
and Larry's outrageous novel,

18:17.729 --> 18:19.564
and the snakes in the garden.

18:19.565 --> 18:20.723
Yes, all right, thank you.

18:21.721 --> 18:24.554
Most people here love you.

18:24.555 --> 18:29.544
And we love them,
and we love Greek culture.

18:29.545 --> 18:30.702
How can we show that?

18:34.694 --> 18:36.729
There's a local festival soon,
the Panegyri.

18:36.730 --> 18:39.044
Get involved, go along.

18:39.045 --> 18:41.679
So the locals can boo
and point at us.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.673
Just tone everything down a little,
for a while?

18:45.671 --> 18:48.664
Apart from a few ophidiophobics.
Who?

18:48.665 --> 18:52.656
People who are scared of snakes,
Corfiots love Gerry's zoo project.

18:52.657 --> 18:54.652
Well they can take it over,
because he's lost interest.

18:54.653 --> 18:57.007
What? No!
I know!

18:57.008 --> 19:01.639
I suspect Gerry's upset because
he's missing Larry and Margo.

19:02.636 --> 19:04.631
Sibling love runs very deep.

19:04.632 --> 19:05.630
Hmm...

19:06.628 --> 19:08.624
..or, could it be about a girl?

19:19.602 --> 19:20.600
KNOCK ON DOOR

19:26.268 --> 19:29.580
Right, well you still look like
a wet Monday in Portsmouth,

19:29.581 --> 19:31.577
so, we are going to talk about this.

19:32.575 --> 19:33.573
Is it Galini?

19:35.569 --> 19:37.564
HE CRIES

19:37.565 --> 19:38.563
Gerry...

19:39.561 --> 19:42.553
She likes a bigger boy
with a motorbike.

19:42.554 --> 19:46.226
I haven't got a chance, I look so
childish with all these animals!

19:46.227 --> 19:49.060
Now she's moved on, I'll never
get a girlfriend with a zoo!

19:49.061 --> 19:50.537
I don't want a girlfriend,
I want Galini.

19:50.538 --> 19:53.211
Say that again,
but with breaths in between.

19:53.212 --> 19:54.370
HE CHUCKLES

19:56.526 --> 19:58.043
What's Galini said to you?

19:59.040 --> 20:01.355
She didn't need to.

20:01.356 --> 20:03.550
She was so happy with him.

20:03.551 --> 20:05.506
She's never looked at me that way.

20:05.507 --> 20:07.502
Oh, Gerry...

20:07.503 --> 20:10.496
Gerry, most of this is in your head.

20:10.497 --> 20:13.170
Look, she may have fallen for
another boy,

20:13.171 --> 20:14.488
but she still likes you.

20:14.489 --> 20:16.484
I don't want to be liked.

20:16.485 --> 20:19.518
I want to be loved, like I love her.

20:21.474 --> 20:23.469
It was animals
that brought you together,

20:23.470 --> 20:25.466
and people don't just change
overnight.

20:26.464 --> 20:28.499
Well, I have.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.293
I need a motorbike.

20:31.294 --> 20:35.445
Nonsense, you're barely .

20:35.446 --> 20:38.438
We might be able to afford
a new bicycle.

20:38.439 --> 20:41.433
In a swish colour? New bell.

20:42.431 --> 20:44.427
I don't want a stupid bell.

20:45.465 --> 20:48.418
Well, those animals need
looking after and feeding.

20:48.419 --> 20:49.616
LOUISA SIGHS

21:13.368 --> 21:16.042
I... loved that.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.357
So did I.

21:20.353 --> 21:22.029
I loved him, didn't you?

21:22.030 --> 21:23.347
Yes. And her.

21:25.183 --> 21:28.337
So... life can be quite exciting.

21:29.335 --> 21:30.333
Oh, yes.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.316
SHE SNORES

22:17.236 --> 22:19.231
How's your girlfriend?

22:19.232 --> 22:21.227
A bit of a handful.

22:21.228 --> 22:23.224
I'm sure.

22:25.220 --> 22:29.211
# ..let me love me too... #

22:29.212 --> 22:31.207
HE HUMS

22:38.193 --> 22:39.231
Basil!

22:42.185 --> 22:43.183
How'd it go?

22:43.184 --> 22:46.176
I shall draw a veil over what passed
between us.

22:46.177 --> 22:49.170
Oh, that bad, huh?

22:49.171 --> 22:52.163
Look, actually I've been thinking,
it's a dangerous game we're playing

22:52.164 --> 22:54.001
so maybe that's...

23:01.984 --> 23:03.141
..not a bad thing.

23:03.142 --> 23:05.177
I mean a gentleman never tells.

23:05.178 --> 23:08.131
Suffice to say,
I received a warm welcome.

23:08.132 --> 23:09.328
Warm?

23:09.329 --> 23:13.121
Warm... to hot.

23:15.117 --> 23:17.113
I don't think you should see her
again.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.102
Oh, I see, you sent me in there

23:22.103 --> 23:24.098
to clear the way
for your mother to be with Spiros.

23:24.099 --> 23:25.097
All right, yes.

23:27.093 --> 23:29.087
I'm now just realising it may
be more complicated than that...

23:29.088 --> 23:30.764
emotionally.

23:30.765 --> 23:33.079
I'll give your request some thought.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.076
But it would be a shame to stop now.

24:12.359 --> 24:14.195
We must just talk in French
from now on.

24:14.196 --> 24:16.989
I'll take you through the regular
verbs tomorrow.

24:16.990 --> 24:18.665
Yes.

24:18.666 --> 24:19.984
After I've learned them.

24:24.973 --> 24:25.971
Ah...

24:28.965 --> 24:29.963
Tea.

24:31.959 --> 24:33.476
Thank you.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.933
Spiros, I fear we have a problem.

24:43.934 --> 24:45.930
It doesn't feel like it.

24:47.926 --> 24:49.921
I'm being sent to Coventry.

24:49.922 --> 24:50.920
Where?

24:50.921 --> 24:53.274
Well, it's a city
in the English Midlands,

24:53.275 --> 24:55.430
with a very beautiful medieval
centre.

24:55.431 --> 24:56.907
Oh, don't go.

24:56.908 --> 24:57.906
No, no, it means...

24:59.902 --> 25:01.897
Never mind.

25:01.898 --> 25:05.888
And Theo says we're getting a
reputation as a house of ill repute.

25:05.889 --> 25:08.243
Yes.

25:08.244 --> 25:09.880
You knew?

25:09.881 --> 25:12.874
I love my people but sometimes they
have too many opinions.

25:12.875 --> 25:14.870
Like the English.

25:14.871 --> 25:15.869
This will pass.

25:17.865 --> 25:19.860
Wha... what are they saying?

25:19.861 --> 25:21.855
That we spend too much time
together.

25:21.856 --> 25:22.854
Well, that's all right.

25:22.855 --> 25:26.846
And that your guest house should
be... shut down.

25:48.801 --> 25:51.316
Now, thank you for gathering.

25:52.314 --> 25:53.791
Get out of my chair.

25:54.829 --> 25:56.784
Easy, Countess.

25:56.785 --> 25:57.783
Maniac.

25:57.784 --> 26:00.456
Now, you are all splendid people.

26:00.457 --> 26:02.771
Ah, that's nice.

26:02.772 --> 26:04.767
There's a but coming.
If only, darling.

26:04.768 --> 26:06.763
What?
It's a rude homosexual joke.

26:06.764 --> 26:08.759
Explain!
Butt as in buttocks.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.274
Now, this is exactly the kind of
thing I want to talk about.

26:11.275 --> 26:13.749
You want to talk about buttocks?
THEY LAUGH

26:13.750 --> 26:17.780
No, I want to talk about us getting
complaints about our morals.

26:17.781 --> 26:18.938
How do you mean?

26:18.939 --> 26:23.728
Locals have been gawping in at us
and have seen skinny dipping,

26:23.729 --> 26:28.718
and you two snuggling up together,
and God knows what else.

26:28.719 --> 26:30.913
And Argos the gobby Postman has been
spreading rumours.

26:30.914 --> 26:32.710
Who bloody cares?

26:32.711 --> 26:33.709
Well, I do,

26:33.710 --> 26:37.700
if it means being snubbed in public
or having this place shut down.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.056
OK.

26:41.692 --> 26:46.681
We are all foreign, and we need
to work hard to be accepted,

26:46.682 --> 26:48.198
and to embrace their culture,

26:48.199 --> 26:51.192
and respect their traditional
way of life.

26:51.193 --> 26:55.663
Countess, keep your wig on,
or off, or under a hat.

26:55.664 --> 26:58.696
Veronica, wear a swimsuit.

26:58.697 --> 27:00.652
It's not as fun.

27:00.653 --> 27:01.690
You're telling me.
Not for us.

27:01.691 --> 27:04.644
Don't worry, we'll behave.

27:04.645 --> 27:05.643
Thank you.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.632
We can repair
the damage and show them

27:10.633 --> 27:13.627
how culturally sensitive
we really are.

27:15.622 --> 27:17.658
BELLS RING,
CHANTING IN GREEK

27:33.586 --> 27:36.578
Oh, hello Mrs Durrell.

27:36.579 --> 27:37.577
And guests.

27:37.578 --> 27:40.570
Lumis and Harry,
my American friends.

27:40.571 --> 27:43.923
Pleasure to meet any servant
of the Greek Orthodox religion.

27:43.924 --> 27:47.556
Me too. What an inspiring church.

27:47.557 --> 27:48.555
My wife would adore this.

27:48.556 --> 27:51.548
Mine too. Wish I'd had
all my children baptised here.

27:51.549 --> 27:53.543
Sorry, it will be all in Greek.

27:53.544 --> 27:55.539
Oh... Is it a long service?

27:55.540 --> 27:57.535
Hope so!
Can't be too long!

27:57.536 --> 27:58.574
Two hours and a half.

28:12.506 --> 28:13.503
Kalimera, Argos.

28:13.504 --> 28:15.499
Kalimera.

28:21.487 --> 28:25.478
Letter from the Auntie in Dorset,
and another bill from the landlord.

28:25.479 --> 28:26.477
Oh, efharisto.

28:26.478 --> 28:29.470
Oh, oh, please,
would you like a cup of tea?

28:29.471 --> 28:32.463
And some delicious local Samali.

28:32.464 --> 28:34.459
We were just wondering
who could tell us

28:34.460 --> 28:37.453
more about your lovely island.

28:37.454 --> 28:38.452
Yes.

28:43.442 --> 28:47.434
I'll invite our fabulous neighbours,
who we always mean to talk to.

28:49.948 --> 28:53.420
I'm just re-reading the Iliad.

28:53.421 --> 28:55.417
By the Greek author, Homer.

29:07.393 --> 29:08.391
THEY CHUCKLE

29:08.392 --> 29:11.383
I must go. That was very fun.

29:11.384 --> 29:16.573
Next time I suggest going to church
in Greece, throw me down a well.

29:16.574 --> 29:18.728
Why do they all wear boring black?

29:18.729 --> 29:20.365
Break out some orange.

29:20.366 --> 29:23.359
It was the mad singing that got me.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.356
HE CHANTS MOCKINGLY

29:29.347 --> 29:32.340
Still here. Ah.

29:32.341 --> 29:33.339
Goodness.
Hello.

29:43.838 --> 29:45.315
Sorry.

29:47.311 --> 29:48.308
What will they think of us now?

29:48.309 --> 29:50.304
And who can blame them?
Indeed.

29:53.298 --> 29:56.291
You're wearing long trousers.

29:56.292 --> 29:57.290
Yeah, my long trousers.

29:58.288 --> 30:01.282
You can't wear long trousers.
I, I'm not ready.

30:03.278 --> 30:05.633
Come back here,
and put your shorts on!

30:19.245 --> 30:21.241
Be ye not swotting?

30:22.239 --> 30:25.232
Maud prefers to study
in the open air.

30:25.233 --> 30:26.230
Oh?

30:26.231 --> 30:28.226
Where do you do it?
Park.

30:30.222 --> 30:32.217
Nice morning?

30:32.218 --> 30:34.213
We're trying out new retirement
activities.

30:34.214 --> 30:37.208
And we'd rather be dead than go
horse-riding again.

30:40.721 --> 30:42.038
We'll be off then.

30:44.034 --> 30:47.186
Maud's mother is a huge cheese
in the village.

30:47.187 --> 30:49.383
We'll be damaged socially if you
lead Maud astray.

30:51.179 --> 30:53.175
All right, keep your hair on.

30:57.167 --> 30:58.364
MUFFLED GIGGLING

31:01.159 --> 31:02.157
Shall I finish the zoo?

31:02.158 --> 31:06.148
Or we could turn it into a prison
for small children.

31:08.344 --> 31:10.818
I'm sure Gerry will change his mind.

31:10.819 --> 31:13.133
Till then, what a great excuse
to let a few go.

31:13.134 --> 31:14.171
Starting with that frigging parrot,

31:14.172 --> 31:17.125
weeks trying to get him
to say "kill Hitler", nothing.

31:17.126 --> 31:18.483
No! You stop it!

31:20.479 --> 31:22.953
He looks so pleased to see us.

31:22.954 --> 31:24.111
You could just hug him.

31:25.109 --> 31:27.104
Then make him into some shoes.

31:27.105 --> 31:28.103
THEY LAUGH

31:30.099 --> 31:33.093
Kill Hitler, kill Hitler!

31:42.074 --> 31:44.069
Is Basil all right?

31:44.070 --> 31:45.068
He's rather nervy.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.064
PARROT SQUAWKS,
HE YELLS

31:48.062 --> 31:50.058
He seems fine to me.

31:51.056 --> 31:53.051
Do you think he wants a lift?

31:53.052 --> 31:54.050
Wherever he's going.

31:55.567 --> 31:57.044
I doubt it.

31:58.880 --> 32:02.072
'Then I might have made a bit of
a balls up over Basil and Spiros.

32:02.073 --> 32:06.024
'By the way, I only wrote this
because Mother made us all write to

32:06.025 --> 32:07.023
'you in order to
"look like a family".'

32:07.023 --> 32:08.021
"Look like a family".

32:08.022 --> 32:11.054
'So I'll say "goodbye" now then.
Best wishes, Leslie.

32:11.055 --> 32:13.050
'Brackets Durrell.'

32:13.051 --> 32:15.844
Leslie brackets Durrell.

LARRY SCOFFS

32:17.003 --> 32:18.998
Les, Les...

32:18.999 --> 32:21.991
'Darling, solid, Les.

32:21.992 --> 32:23.987
'A more grudging letter has
seldom come my way,

32:23.988 --> 32:27.980
'but thanks anyway as I know writing
comes as naturally to you, as...

'..basket-weaving to a fish.'

CHATTING IN GREEK

32:40.953 --> 32:41.951
Hello.

32:41.952 --> 32:43.946
Yassou, Gerry.

32:43.947 --> 32:46.941
I'm actually getting a motorcycle
too, so...

32:48.777 --> 32:49.935
..can I have a go?

32:50.973 --> 32:52.928
I don't think you know how to ride.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.924
What makes you say that?

32:54.925 --> 32:57.917
Gerry, I know you.

32:57.918 --> 32:58.916
Do you though?

33:00.912 --> 33:01.910
Right...

33:09.894 --> 33:11.890
HE SPEAKS GREEK

33:13.886 --> 33:14.884
Yes.

33:14.885 --> 33:16.879
HE CONTINUES IN GREEK
I know.

33:23.865 --> 33:25.382
Slow down!

33:28.695 --> 33:29.853
Gerry!

33:42.028 --> 33:46.817
Theo!Hello, decadent enemies of
the decent citizens of Corfu.

33:46.818 --> 33:49.811
Don't! Look, we feel awful.

33:49.812 --> 33:51.847
How can we make
people here like us more?

33:51.848 --> 33:53.483
Leave the country.

33:53.484 --> 33:56.796
I've told you, come to the Panegyri
festival I mentioned,

33:56.797 --> 33:58.792
and see us as we really are.

33:58.793 --> 34:02.824
Merry, welcoming, and eating
weird sheep's gizzards on a skewer.

34:02.825 --> 34:04.301
I don't know.

34:04.302 --> 34:06.776
Come on, you love the Greeks,
show us!

34:06.777 --> 34:08.132
What does it involve?

34:08.134 --> 34:10.768
Singing and dancing
in traditional costumes.

34:10.768 --> 34:12.764
No, not doing that.

34:12.764 --> 34:14.759
Yes, you are, it will be fun!

34:14.760 --> 34:16.118
And repair your reputation.

34:28.253 --> 34:30.726
Perhaps I should be a policewoman.

34:30.728 --> 34:31.726
Yes.

34:31.726 --> 34:33.721
Maybe don't tell your parents yet.

34:35.717 --> 34:37.712
Life should be like this.

34:37.713 --> 34:39.748
That's bad though, smoking in bed.

34:39.748 --> 34:43.699
It's too dark.
Get them to put the lights on.

34:43.701 --> 34:45.737
I fear that impairs the picture,
dear.

34:47.054 --> 34:49.208
Where are they?

34:49.210 --> 34:52.681
Sweet Jesus, that's too bright.

AUDIENCE MEMBER SHUSHES

34:54.199 --> 34:56.194
Margo!

34:56.195 --> 34:58.669
Margo.

34:58.670 --> 34:59.668
Margo.

35:03.660 --> 35:06.653
We found old tickets in your jacket,
you unruly girl.

35:06.654 --> 35:09.647
What will Mrs Kemble say if she
finds out that instead of learning,

35:09.648 --> 35:11.642
her daughter's been consorting
in a pleasure-house?

35:11.643 --> 35:12.641
It's only a cinema!

35:12.642 --> 35:15.634
Films are so beautiful and
thrilling, stay and watch.

35:15.635 --> 35:18.628
We have never been to the flicks and
we are not starting now.

35:18.629 --> 35:20.625
It might help you to be more rounded
people, you know.

35:21.623 --> 35:23.619
Sorry, sorry.

35:45.414 --> 35:47.569
Yes, the hands, higher.

35:47.570 --> 35:49.564
No, swing Mrs Durrell round, Leslie.

35:49.565 --> 35:51.560
Hang on,
which way should I be facing?

35:51.561 --> 35:53.756
Not there.

35:53.757 --> 35:55.552
Down.
OK.

35:55.553 --> 35:56.551
Down.

35:56.552 --> 35:58.546
The chin up.

35:58.547 --> 35:59.545
Watch Gerry, he's the best.

35:59.546 --> 36:01.540
No, he isn't!

36:01.541 --> 36:03.537
I've certificates
in country dancing.

36:04.535 --> 36:07.887
Where is Basil? He never goes out.

36:07.888 --> 36:09.523
I don't know.

36:09.524 --> 36:11.360
Right, let's give up.

36:11.361 --> 36:12.517
No!

36:12.518 --> 36:13.516
We have till tomorrow.

36:13.517 --> 36:17.508
If it's the last thing I do, I'll
make you look like you belong here!

TRADITIONAL GREEK MUSIC PLAYS

36:47.965 --> 36:50.798
Maybe they don't like us wearing
clothes of their culture.

36:50.799 --> 36:52.435
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

36:52.436 --> 36:54.431
You're ready, come on.
Nice faces on.

36:54.432 --> 36:56.427
This is the Sirto,
that we learnt yesterday.

36:56.428 --> 36:58.463
Yeah.
Come on, come on, this is it.

36:58.464 --> 37:00.420
With your hands.
Yes, yes, yes.

37:03.414 --> 37:04.411
Boys in the centre.

37:06.407 --> 37:07.445
Yes.

37:10.399 --> 37:11.756
No, no, no, not like that.

37:14.391 --> 37:16.386
Not that way, Mrs Durrell.

37:16.387 --> 37:18.222
Whoa!

37:18.223 --> 37:23.371
Leslie, no, not like that,
you're jumping too late. No!

37:23.372 --> 37:26.366
Sorry, your foot, sorry.

37:28.362 --> 37:30.358
You look gorgeous in that blouse,
by the way.

37:40.338 --> 37:44.328
That was quite disappointing,
but we remain confident.

37:44.329 --> 37:46.324
Yes.
Good twirling, Mrs Durrell.

37:46.325 --> 37:47.362
Oh, well, thank you.

37:47.363 --> 37:50.316
But try not to hit people
with your arms.

37:50.317 --> 37:51.315
Leslie...

37:51.316 --> 37:54.308
No I'm done. I'm gonna get us some
booze and snacks,

37:54.309 --> 37:55.825
that'll endear us to everyone.

37:55.826 --> 37:57.303
Leslie!
Leslie!

38:25.245 --> 38:27.241
LAUGHING,
MURMURING

38:31.233 --> 38:34.585
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Hello you two!

38:34.586 --> 38:37.220
Hello.
Oh, thank you.

38:37.221 --> 38:39.215
No, that's for the people over by
the dancing.

38:39.216 --> 38:42.210
We're all there, Spiros, and so on.

38:43.208 --> 38:47.199
D'you think you should...
go home, perhaps?

38:47.200 --> 38:49.195
It is one of the choices, yes.

38:49.196 --> 38:50.712
Which way are you walking?

38:50.713 --> 38:52.189
Like this.

38:52.190 --> 38:55.183
THEY LAUGH

38:55.184 --> 38:56.859
That way.

38:56.860 --> 38:59.174
Oh gosh, that's erm,
that's actually on my route,

38:59.175 --> 39:01.170
so er, I'll walk with you.

39:01.171 --> 39:02.169
OK.

39:10.153 --> 39:11.151
GREEK MUSIC PLAYING

39:39.453 --> 39:41.927
THEY SING IN GREEK

39:55.060 --> 39:57.056
APPLAUSE

40:03.044 --> 40:05.039
Bravo, bravo.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.034
I hope that showed them we're not
just a bunch of crass foreigners.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.388
Elate.

40:10.389 --> 40:12.026
Look.

40:33.980 --> 40:37.972
Oh, please be jealous,
please be jealous.

41:05.915 --> 41:08.908
I feel so part of life here.

41:08.909 --> 41:11.103
I'm so glad we could show it.

41:11.104 --> 41:12.899
You certainly have.

41:12.900 --> 41:15.893
They love you again. Hmm?

41:15.894 --> 41:17.889
We're not decadent, are we?

41:17.890 --> 41:20.884
Your son is kissing a girl
in the public square.

41:22.720 --> 41:23.877
So he is.

41:23.878 --> 41:26.073
Stop that, Gerry.

41:27.870 --> 41:29.067
OWL SCREECHES

41:34.855 --> 41:36.851
Ah, morning Spiros.

41:37.849 --> 41:39.844
Ooh, that's a big bag.

41:39.845 --> 41:41.840
Have you brought a special tool?

41:41.841 --> 41:43.836
No, it is some clothes and things.

41:43.837 --> 41:45.034
Oh!

41:47.829 --> 41:49.824
Can I stay at your house
for a while?

41:50.822 --> 41:51.820
Yes, of course.

41:52.818 --> 41:54.175
Any reason?

41:55.812 --> 41:57.807
Well that make sense, er...

41:57.808 --> 42:00.801
It does. Well, there's lots of...

42:00.802 --> 42:02.798
There is a lot of handyman work...

42:04.794 --> 42:05.792
..with finishing the zoo.

42:05.792 --> 42:06.790
Absolutely.

42:08.785 --> 42:10.821
And there's no problems at home?

42:12.777 --> 42:15.771
You know my wife and I
are arguing a lot...

42:16.769 --> 42:19.762
..and last night it was worse,

42:19.763 --> 42:21.759
she doesn't want me there...

42:23.595 --> 42:24.753
..so...

42:27.746 --> 42:29.742
Yes?

42:30.740 --> 42:32.735
It is mainly about the hand...

42:32.736 --> 42:34.732
The handyman work, yes, of course.

42:35.730 --> 42:37.726
This is a good, practical solution.

42:39.722 --> 42:43.714
An attic room is free,
so please make yourself at home.

42:46.707 --> 42:47.705
Thank you.

42:52.895 --> 42:54.691
Spiros is moving in for a while.

42:55.689 --> 42:57.684
Oh.

42:57.685 --> 42:59.680
Do you know anything about
what's happening at his home?

42:59.681 --> 43:01.876
No, no I don't.

43:12.654 --> 43:14.649
'The Mayor asks ,
holiday-makers to tea,

43:14.650 --> 43:15.847
'and look how many turned up.

43:15.848 --> 43:18.641
'Maybe he didn't realise how many
people there were in Ramsgate.

43:18.642 --> 43:20.638
'Waiter, fetch me a cup of tea.'

43:25.627 --> 43:29.618
'This is a record of
the power politics of .

43:29.619 --> 43:31.614
'This is modern history
in the making.

'Cold-blooded, ruthless intolerance.

'They are pictures of Italy's
invasion of Albania.'

43:36.605 --> 43:38.601
Albania's only two miles
away from Corfu.

43:41.275 --> 43:43.589
I'm not very good at that part of
the world.

43:43.590 --> 43:45.585
Let's get a book.

43:45.586 --> 43:46.584
You don't understand.

43:46.585 --> 43:50.415
'.., the occupation of Albania,
and the apparent delight...'

43:50.416 --> 43:51.573
I need to go back there
to be with my family.

43:51.574 --> 43:53.610
'..brought to you by courtesy
of the conqueror.'

44:08.539 --> 44:12.530
So, how does your wife feel about
you staying here?

44:12.531 --> 44:14.526
I'm not sure that matters to me
any more.

44:14.527 --> 44:15.525
Oh.

44:16.523 --> 44:18.518
Oh, I'm sorry. Why's that?

44:18.519 --> 44:20.513
She seems to have a boyfriend.

44:20.514 --> 44:23.507
Doesn't that make it easier for you
to be with my mother?

44:23.508 --> 44:25.504
No, not that way.

44:27.340 --> 44:31.492
If people know, it will bring shame
on me and my children.

44:35.843 --> 44:40.473
And if I find out who it is,
I'll be in jail for murdering him.

44:51.451 --> 44:54.445
You've continued the affair
with Spiros' wife haven't you?

44:55.642 --> 44:58.955
If I have, and I have actually...

44:59.953 --> 45:02.427
..it was your idea, so don't come
crying to me over spilt milk,

45:02.428 --> 45:03.426
as it were.

45:03.427 --> 45:05.421
It was a mistake.

45:05.422 --> 45:07.417
I asked you to end it!

45:07.418 --> 45:09.413
What is a red-blooded man to do?

45:09.414 --> 45:13.405
For once I find a lovely woman,
in a bad marriage,

45:13.406 --> 45:15.402
who laughs with me,
rather than at me.

45:20.391 --> 45:21.429
Well, just so you know...

45:23.385 --> 45:25.381
..Spiros will kill you
if he finds out.

45:27.377 --> 45:29.732
And then probably me,
for setting it up.

45:31.369 --> 45:32.367
Fine.

45:44.382 --> 45:47.335
'Scout leader Demitrios is looking
for a successor.'

45:47.336 --> 45:48.334
I'd be delighted.

45:48.335 --> 45:51.007
The Royal ship
will sail past their house.

45:51.008 --> 45:53.323
That's where we'll practice
our display for the king.

45:53.324 --> 45:55.837
My family are in Corfu,
I wanna be with them.

45:55.838 --> 45:58.312
Margo's back, everyone!

45:58.313 --> 45:59.510
You know your wife
was having an affair.

45:59.511 --> 46:04.819
You interfered in my life and my
marriage, I can never forgive you.
