- Okay, that's it!

11:14.340 --> 11:16.258
- Phillip...hungry.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.470
Maddie...brains.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.639
- Andi, I-I--let's go.
Let's get out of here.

11:21.722 --> 11:22.681
Excuse me.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.646
Phillip almost ate
Maddie's brain.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.731
That's exactly why
he shouldn't be here!

11:30.815 --> 11:32.733
- Wait--he'd be
doing us all a favor!

11:32.817 --> 11:35.236
I mean, how much cooler
would a zombie Maddie be

11:35.319 --> 11:36.695
than regular Maddie?

11:38.697 --> 11:39.949
- Scary.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.325
That's not the point.

11:41.409 --> 11:45.704
The point is, he's not going
to adjust to our world.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.915
He's always going to be
a zombie,

11:47.998 --> 11:50.668
no matter how much you try to
distract him with pizza.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.254
- Oh, but Phillip is--

11:53.337 --> 11:54.380
Wait.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.297

Well, what should I tell her?

- No, duh.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.750
- Okay, I will.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.294

No way.

Class now.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.573
Did he just try to
bite my head?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.493
- What?
No, no, no.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.412
No, that's just
a Romanian custom.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.707
- Custom or not, that is
unacceptable at Iridium High.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.001
I have to suspend him.
- What? No.

13:56.085 --> 14:00.089
- And you--you take your
friend off school grounds.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.090
- Me? Why me?

14:01.173 --> 14:03.801
- Oh, because I saw you
egging him on.

have the last period free.

14:55.686 --> 14:58.314
She framed Lily,
and I fell for it.

14:58.397 --> 15:02.443
I have to stop her before
she destroys us all.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.111
And I have to stop
talking to myself.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.075
- Whoa, nice move.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.702
- How is he?

15:11.785 --> 15:12.745
- He's fine.

15:12.828 --> 15:13.746
We've just been playing--

15:13.829 --> 15:15.748
- "Zombie Apocalypse 3."
- Yeah.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.541
And look how happy he is.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.420
He could be this happy
all the time...

15:21.503 --> 15:23.422
if you just let him go
back into the game.

15:23.505 --> 15:26.508

15:26.592 --> 15:28.093
You don't know
him at all.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.303
- I know that the game

15:29.386 --> 15:30.387
is the only thing
that calms him down.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.140
- No, there's
also another thing.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.141
Pizza.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.185
- Pizza?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.561
- See?
Come on, Phillip,

15:37.645 --> 15:38.020
let's go
get some pizza at the Seven.

15:39.938 --> 15:40.981
- How many pizzas
has he eaten

15:41.065 --> 15:41.523
in the last few days?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.525
- Only a few...

15:43.609 --> 15:44.652
hundred.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.458
- Danny!

15:59.541 --> 16:01.502
I mean, Daniel, hi.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.296
- Can I come in?

16:04.380 --> 16:06.215
It's important.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.424
- Yeah, sure.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.387
- Uh, hey, Jax, how's it going?

16:11.470 --> 16:13.847
- Yeah, great.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.892
Just chilling on the couch
all day with my Em, cuddling.

16:16.975 --> 16:19.228
- What's the matter?

16:19.311 --> 16:20.646
- It's Andi.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.981
She refuses to send Phillip
back into the game,

16:23.065 --> 16:25.609
even though he tried to bite
several people in school today.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.236
- Did they see him?

16:27.319 --> 16:28.404
- Oh, they saw him.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.239
He tried to bite both of them.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.490
- What?
- [laughing] What?

16:31.573 --> 16:34.493
I mean...what?

16:34.576 --> 16:36.620
- And now she's at
the Seven with him.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.288
If he tries to bite someone
there,

16:38.372 --> 16:39.665
someone could see him and--

16:39.748 --> 16:41.792
- It could be really bad.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.377
Oh, I should have sent him
right back into the game

16:43.460 --> 16:44.837
when he first arrived.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.088
- It's okay.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.589
You tried to make Andi
happy, and I get that.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.842
- Are you done here?

16:49.925 --> 16:51.510
Me and my Em need to
get back to cuddling.

16:51.593 --> 16:52.511
- I have to fix this.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.179
Let's get to the Seven.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.642
- That didn't turn out
the way I wanted it to.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.230
- Here we are.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.733
- What are those?

17:05.816 --> 17:07.401
- My potential boyfriends.

17:07.483 --> 17:08.609
- And hanging out
with the Panthers

17:08.694 --> 17:10.404
just keeps getting
more bizarre.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.577
- I'm leaning towards
the golden retriever.

17:16.660 --> 17:17.703
The bulldog would be funny.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.204
And the Chihuahua
would be super active.

17:19.288 --> 17:24.667
But the retriever would be
loyal, strong and loving.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.714
- Doing this spell
I thought I'd never,

17:28.797 --> 17:30.466
but turn this dog
into a boy

17:30.549 --> 17:31.216
who will
love Katie forever.

17:33.844 --> 17:34.845
- Oh, he's so cute.

17:34.928 --> 17:35.512
He'll make
the perfect boyfriend.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.266
- What's happening?

17:43.103 --> 17:44.688
Why is he following me?

17:44.772 --> 17:46.648
- Because he's the love
of your life, remember?

17:46.732 --> 17:47.983
[laughs]

17:48.067 --> 17:50.360
- I changed my mind.
I don't want a dog boyfriend.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.653
Maddie, change him back.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.489
- Sure, I will, after you get
your punishment

17:53.572 --> 17:54.656
for blackmailing me.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.492
- What punishment?

17:56.575 --> 17:57.701
- Living with your dog
boyfriend

17:57.785 --> 18:00.412
for the rest of the day.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.747
- No!

18:14.384 --> 18:16.136

18:16.220 --> 18:17.387
you think I'm pretty?

18:18.722 --> 18:19.932
You're so cute.

18:20.015 --> 18:20.891
- You didn't tell me

18:20.974 --> 18:22.351
Phillip tried to
bite my dad!

18:22.434 --> 18:26.480
- Oh, did I leave
that tiny detail out?

18:26.563 --> 18:29.024
- Andi, he's bound to
actually bite someone soon.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.526
- And anybody could see.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.277
- Relax, he's fine.

18:32.361 --> 18:36.365
But I have used almost all
my savings on pizza for him.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.033

18:38.116 --> 18:40.244
How 'bout it, partner?

18:40.327 --> 18:41.870

dice on the partnership.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.705
- Ah, I've reconsidered.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.291
Now, money--cough it up.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.584
- Andi, this has to stop.

18:47.668 --> 18:48.794
I mean, he's fine right
now, but he could get--
