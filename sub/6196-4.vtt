told me about some of her issues, but

the circumstances were

I think she would prefer

10:17.216 --> 10:20.676

as opposed to

the time Lisa got drunk,

10:38.604 --> 10:40.212
threw out all her hot combs,

10:40.214 --> 10:42.505
bought a ticket to Kenya,
and came back with twists?

10:44.171 --> 10:46.194

hairstyle out.

10:46.195 --> 10:48.280
That was a mess.

10:48.912 --> 10:50.665
She said it attracted
lesbians.

10:50.666 --> 10:52.837
Do you know that when I met her,
I thought she was a lesbian?

10:52.839 --> 10:55.170
Because of the twists?
- No.

10:55.171 --> 10:57.339
She used to stare me in the eye.

10:57.340 --> 10:59.124
It was like very weird.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.974
And I heard that when lesbians are
picking you up, they do that.

11:01.976 --> 11:04.038
What?
Where did you hear that from?

11:04.040 --> 11:06.298
Some lesbian.
- I did.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.600
Remind me not to look you
in the eye.

11:08.601 --> 11:09.768

11:15.891 --> 11:18.810
[laughing]

11:19.326 --> 11:21.196
So, why was Lisa in Kenya?

11:21.197 --> 11:24.566
She had volunteered for
the Samburu Project.

11:24.567 --> 11:26.735
They built wells.

11:26.736 --> 11:30.121
That was her way of
giving back.

11:30.438 --> 11:34.635
She said, uh, "to whom much is
given, much is required."

11:36.485 --> 11:39.881
We should invite them
to the service.

11:39.882 --> 11:42.050
I think Lisa would really
like that.

11:42.051 --> 11:44.099
Kara, can you... can you call
for me?

11:44.101 --> 11:46.081
Yeah, absolutely.
I don't mind it, you know?

11:46.091 --> 11:47.988

Mary Jane?

11:47.990 --> 11:49.384

She was a mentor there. Can you...

11:52.061 --> 11:53.886
I'm on it.
- For the love of philanthropy,

11:53.888 --> 11:56.064
how did she have time to do
all of this?

11:56.065 --> 11:58.233
I can barely remember to brush
my damn teeth.

11:58.234 --> 12:00.723
What kind of service
are you thinking about?

12:00.725 --> 12:04.272
Uh, she was... Buddhist?
- No.

12:04.273 --> 12:06.150
I thought she was Catholic
this whole time.

12:06.152 --> 12:09.557
No, she just liked that the services
were short and you could wear jeans.

12:09.559 --> 12:12.559
Unh-unh. No.
She used to go to AME with me.

12:12.561 --> 12:15.936
No. She was just constantly
searching for something.

12:17.186 --> 12:19.621
The girl was a Methodist.
- Methodist?

12:19.622 --> 12:23.024
First of all, Black people
don't kill themselves.

12:23.255 --> 12:25.940
That's what "They" did.
I mean, come on, you guys.

12:26.096 --> 12:28.072
Okay, granted, we might have,

12:28.074 --> 12:30.670
you know, been suffering from
a lot of other things,

12:30.672 --> 12:32.833
but we took pride in the fact

12:32.835 --> 12:36.021
that no matter how hard things
got, we didn't do that.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.506
I used to wear that like
a badge of honor.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.641
Me, too.

12:39.642 --> 12:42.644
I pinned it right next to
my "Strong Black Woman" badge.

12:42.645 --> 12:45.930
We ain't strong no more cause
we're dying off in plain sight.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.667
What happened to us?
- Yeah, but you know what?

12:47.669 --> 12:52.353
That's the problem is that people
see suicide as a weakness.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.022
It's an illness, you guys.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.115
I beg to differ.
- No, it really is.

12:56.117 --> 12:58.910
Yeah, and the medications
they're peddling are the gun.

12:58.911 --> 13:01.946
Exactly.
- Not all medications are bad.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.753
Kara, are you serious?
- Yeah.

13:03.755 --> 13:05.450
You know the numbers.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.210
How many stories have we done
about serotonin inhibitors

13:08.212 --> 13:09.459
and their connection to suicide?

13:09.461 --> 13:13.675
Yeah, but the numbers also swing
in the opposite direction, MJ.

13:14.314 --> 13:16.527
Not all medication is bad.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.833

and don't know people

on the best drugs their PPO can offer.

15:40.883 --> 15:43.491
and, I don't know,
who we should invite.

15:43.849 --> 15:45.709
I have a lot to say, and I have
a lot to do to make sure

15:45.711 --> 15:48.539
that my friend is buried with
respect and decency,

15:48.541 --> 15:50.448
so forgive me if I don't have time

15:50.450 --> 15:52.716
to co-host a pity party
with you, Mom.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.934
Well, I've already
spoken with her family

15:55.936 --> 15:58.898
and I'm sure that
the arrangements are underway.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.595
What?
- Well, they had a right to know.

16:00.597 --> 16:04.011
You know Lisa hadn't spoken
to them in over 15 years.

16:04.012 --> 16:05.430
Why would you do that?

16:05.431 --> 16:08.883
Every mother has the right
to know.

16:08.884 --> 16:11.798
Let me get... let me get this straight.
So, you're laying here

16:11.800 --> 16:15.253
in mock mourning over the fact

16:15.255 --> 16:18.893
that you think we didn't do
enough to prevent Lisa's death.

16:19.628 --> 16:21.829
But you think inviting
the very people

16:21.831 --> 16:24.192
who planted the seed
to her pain...

16:24.194 --> 16:26.090
It was the right thing to do.

16:26.092 --> 16:27.752
What does that even mean, Mom?

16:27.754 --> 16:30.488
People always say that when they
do something that...

16:30.489 --> 16:32.203
that only makes sense to them,

16:32.574 --> 16:35.151
it's like when you're on the phone
with a customer service rep

16:35.153 --> 16:37.515
and you're... you're trying to
get a straight answer

16:37.517 --> 16:39.714
and they just keep talking nonsense
and then finally they say,

16:39.715 --> 16:41.399
"Ma'am, I'm sorry.
It's company policy."

16:41.401 --> 16:43.895
So... so... so... sorry, Mom,

16:43.897 --> 16:46.402
But I don't think inviting
the people who...

16:46.404 --> 16:48.506
who helped destroy Lisa

16:48.507 --> 16:50.725
should be company policy.

16:50.726 --> 16:51.976
It's not right.

16:51.977 --> 16:53.978

this productive exchange then.

17:07.063 --> 17:09.236
So, you're punishing
me for being busy.

17:09.238 --> 17:10.800
Well, I didn't realize

17:10.801 --> 17:14.800
that making a phone call would feel
like a punishment.

29:19.769 --> 29:20.823
I mean,

29:21.089 --> 29:23.229
who really knows
if she's in a better place?

29:24.892 --> 29:26.798
Could it be much worse?

29:27.215 --> 29:28.357
Really?

29:30.958 --> 29:32.247
I'm sorry.

29:33.409 --> 29:34.424
I guess it's just

29:34.534 --> 29:37.135
hard to find the right thing
to say at a time like this...

29:37.588 --> 29:39.159
for me, at least.

29:42.025 --> 29:43.235
For you,

29:43.758 --> 29:47.084
you always seem to find the right
thing to say in crunch time,

29:48.976 --> 29:51.539
so I'm sure your eulogy
will be perfect.

29:53.408 --> 29:54.780
Thanks.

29:57.697 --> 29:59.556
I hope so.
I mean...

30:00.806 --> 30:03.767
I owe her that much... at least.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.569
It's not your fault.
You know that, right?

30:12.874 --> 30:14.492
I'm sorry, what did you say?

30:16.164 --> 30:18.437
I just want you to know
it's not your fault.

30:18.439 --> 30:20.406
I know it's not my fault!

30:21.520 --> 30:23.070
Oh, Mary Jane, I didn't mean
to say...

30:23.072 --> 30:25.525
No, no, you never mean
for it to hurt, David.

30:25.527 --> 30:27.103
It just always does.

30:27.830 --> 30:29.565
Why would you say
something like that?

30:29.567 --> 30:31.018
I was just trying to find...
- You were just

30:31.127 --> 30:33.364
trying to figure out how
to get Lisa's money.

30:35.735 --> 30:37.091
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

30:37.156 --> 30:39.678
I wasn't the one who screwed
her out of her money

30:39.680 --> 30:41.711
and her dignity...
- Okay...
- ...was I?

30:42.491 --> 30:44.525
First of all,
I didn't screw Lisa.

30:44.526 --> 30:48.329
Are you really gonna
use the Bill Clinton defense?

30:48.494 --> 30:49.828
David, we are in a church.

30:49.913 --> 30:51.443
I'm not using any defense.

30:51.445 --> 30:53.208
I'm just...
- You're just...

30:53.240 --> 30:54.883
Look, I'm just trying to...

30:55.166 --> 30:56.978
What?
- I'm just...

30:58.640 --> 31:01.843
Yeah, right. What?
What, David?

31:03.796 --> 31:06.249
What? What could you
possibly have to say,

31:07.827 --> 31:09.061
huh?

31:09.772 --> 31:12.162
What do you have to say?

31:14.217 --> 31:16.472
Are you trying to blame me
for my friend's suicide

31:16.474 --> 31:19.726
because you don't wanna take
responsibility for one blow job.

31:20.148 --> 31:21.844
At least I think
it was just one.

31:23.062 --> 31:24.516
You... you didn't say,

31:25.358 --> 31:26.437
"we."

31:26.647 --> 31:30.062
We could have really done
a better job by Lisa.

31:31.276 --> 31:32.335
You said me.

31:34.547 --> 31:36.961
God, you pretended to
come here to comfort me,

31:36.963 --> 31:39.283
but you really just came
to comfort yourself.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.780
I'm out of comfort to give you,
David.
