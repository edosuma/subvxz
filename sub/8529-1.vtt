02:45.958 --> 02:49.003
Cardinal Richelieu,
these men they...

02:50.296 --> 02:54.633
Please help me, your eminence.
Please, please have mercy. Please.

02:55.217 --> 02:58.345
He defaced your carriage
and stole valuables from inside.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.639
But it's just a coach.

03:00.931 --> 03:04.101
Please, I was hungry.
My family hasn't eaten for days.

03:04.185 --> 03:07.479
Please. Please.
In the name of God, I beg you.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.150
Very well.

03:13.611 --> 03:15.112
In the name of God.

03:15.446 --> 03:18.032
Oh, thank you, your eminence.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.117
Your place in heaven
will always be assured.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.453
Of course.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.210
No! No! Don't!

03:29.293 --> 03:31.337
No! Please!
Please! God, no!

03:38.135 --> 03:39.929
One less mouth to feed.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.155
Getting sloppy, Girard.

03:58.614 --> 04:00.532
Why don't you do yourself a favor?
Surrender.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.159
My sister's honor is at stake.

04:02.493 --> 04:04.828
How many times do I have to tell you?
Nothing happened.

04:05.246 --> 04:06.664
I know what I saw, D'Artagnan.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.291
Girard, I told her
I was leaving for Paris.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.561
She wanted to give me somethin'
to remember her by.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.836
Liar!

04:13.462 --> 04:14.922
This is stupid, Girard.

04:17.216 --> 04:21.178
All I wanna do is get to Paris...
and join the Musketeers.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.390
You, a Musketeer?
Fantasy!

04:24.848 --> 04:28.143
My father was a Musketeer,
the king's personal bodyguard.

04:28.394 --> 04:30.729
The king was assassinated.
Your father was a failure,

04:31.021 --> 04:32.523
a disgrace to the Musketeers.

04:33.524 --> 04:34.566
What did you say?

04:34.817 --> 04:37.236
Your father was a disgrace.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.292
My brothers will avenge me.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.175
Already?

05:11.186 --> 05:13.939
Charge! Charge!

05:14.690 --> 05:16.984
Get him! He's mine!

05:23.991 --> 05:26.744
Come back! Come back!

06:07.368 --> 06:09.161
Ooh!

06:22.257 --> 06:23.759
He went that way!

07:32.453 --> 07:35.247
Yeah!

07:39.293 --> 07:41.503
We'll get you, D'Artagnan!

07:41.753 --> 07:45.257
In the meantime,
give my regards to your sister.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.190
What should I do
with the Musketeer flag?

08:04.318 --> 08:05.360
Burn it.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.425
Musketeers.

08:29.301 --> 08:33.472
By joint edict of his majesty
the King Louis XIII...

08:33.764 --> 08:36.015
And his eminence Cardinal Richelieu,

08:36.433 --> 08:41.104
the Musketeers are officially disbanded.

08:42.648 --> 08:46.193
In preparation
for the coming war with England,

08:47.194 --> 08:50.697
the ranks and commissions
are forthwith transferred to the infantry.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.825
You shall be notified
and told where to report.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.330
Until such time,
return to your homes.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.416
And who will protect the king?

09:01.792 --> 09:05.796
The cardinal's guards
have already assumed that responsibility.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.097
You are ordered to disperse.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.892
Should even one of you resist,

09:19.142 --> 09:21.853
the entire corps will be arrested
and imprisoned.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.901
All for one...

09:29.069 --> 09:30.487
And one for all.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.034
Well, there's nothing
more to be said, is there?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.126
Your eminence.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.879
An impressive performance.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.923
I especially admired
that last touch...

10:32.633 --> 10:35.385
"All for one and one for all."

10:36.637 --> 10:39.806
If I didn't know better, I should
have thought you wanted them to riot.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.560
It would have given us an excuse
to arrest them.

10:43.727 --> 10:47.564
Hardly necessary.
The Musketeers are finished.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.401
Not entirely.
There are three.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.241
Three?

10:58.825 --> 11:01.025
I sent a patrol to find them.
They haven't returned yet.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.789
I want those Musketeers,
not excuses.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.124
Bring them in at once!

11:09.544 --> 11:10.544
Follow me.

11:14.883 --> 11:18.345
No loose ends this time,
Captain Rochefort.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.061
Athos.

11:26.853 --> 11:27.854
Porthos.

11:28.772 --> 11:29.815
Aramis.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.011
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

12:14.568 --> 12:16.486
Hyah! Hyah!

12:21.867 --> 12:23.910
Ohh!

12:27.873 --> 12:28.873
Whoa!

12:55.817 --> 12:57.297
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

12:57.486 --> 12:59.446
I've saved you and your friend
from these bandits.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.537
These bandits are
the queen's own bodyguards.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.205
The queen?

13:10.290 --> 13:11.666
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.836
- What's your name?
- D'Artagnan.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.798
D'Artagnan. A gascon?

13:18.215 --> 13:20.217
I've come to Paris
to join the Musketeers.

13:21.218 --> 13:23.018
Then I'm sure I'll be
hearing your name again.

13:24.721 --> 13:25.722
Would that please you?

13:26.431 --> 13:29.184
Ladies-in-waiting are forbidden
to socialize with Musketeers.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.228
Well, I'm not a Musketeer yet.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.147
With that kind of courage,
you will be one soon enough.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.775
Good luck, D'Artagnan.

13:37.776 --> 13:40.237
And thank you for the entertainment.
I enjoyed it immensely.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.408
Wait! You didn't tell me your name!

13:45.784 --> 13:46.952
Constance!

13:51.498 --> 13:52.833
Constance.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.420
Come along.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.442
Is this Musketeer headquarters?

15:04.946 --> 15:07.073
No, this was Musketeer headquarters.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.326
Oh, you mean it's been moved.

15:10.702 --> 15:13.914
No, I mean the Musketeers
have been disbanded. They no longer exist.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.292
Feel free to poke around for souvenirs
if you wish.

15:17.542 --> 15:18.877
But I just got here.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.106
How am I supposed to become
a Musketeer if they've been disbanded?

15:22.130 --> 15:24.049
I'd say you've got quite a problem.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.217
You're not being very helpful.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.596
You need a lesson in manners, boy.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.097
Anytime.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.180
Why don't you meet me outside the city,
by the ruins?

15:36.394 --> 15:37.394
Let's say noon?

15:39.522 --> 15:40.982
I'll be there!

15:54.162 --> 15:55.205
There he is.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.375
Come on! Out of my way, man!
Out of my way!

15:58.875 --> 16:00.210
How dare you touch me?

16:00.502 --> 16:01.586
D'Artagnan!

16:02.170 --> 16:03.922
Get your hands off me!
D'Artagnan!

16:05.173 --> 16:06.299
D'Artagnan!

16:06.549 --> 16:08.110
Here. Hold this horse for me, all right?

16:08.134 --> 16:10.470
I'll be right back.
You got it? Thank you.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.369
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Excuse me!

16:39.666 --> 16:43.545
This sash was a gift to me
from the queen of America.

16:44.713 --> 16:45.964
There's no queen of America.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.508
I beg to differ, infant.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.450
We're on quite intimate terms
unless you can prove otherwise.

16:52.303 --> 16:54.472
Here's my proof.

16:54.723 --> 16:58.059
Oh, I see.
It's twit of the month.

16:58.476 --> 16:59.956
Come to challenge the mighty Porthos.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.814
- Thinks he's lightning with a sword.
- The mighty who?

17:04.523 --> 17:06.151
Don't tell me you've never heard of me.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.944
The world's biggest windbag?

17:09.194 --> 17:13.616
Little pimple, meet me
behind the Luxembourg at one o'clock,

17:13.992 --> 17:15.577
and bring a long wooden box.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.038
Bring your own.

17:25.462 --> 17:29.424
"God took them and put them
in the garden to till it and care for it,

17:29.591 --> 17:32.260
"but of the fruit of the tree,
which is in the midst of the garden,

17:32.427 --> 17:34.971
"God hath said,
'Ye shall not eat of it.

17:35.472 --> 17:38.975
"Neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.'

17:39.809 --> 17:42.353
"Then the serpent said
unto the woman, 'Ye...""

17:47.358 --> 17:51.780
Madam, I'm flattered,
but I am here to tutor you in theology.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.615
Forgive me, Monsieur Aramis,

17:54.324 --> 17:56.659
but when you started talking
about original sin,

17:57.118 --> 17:59.079
I lost control
and became impassioned.

17:59.621 --> 18:02.082
It won't happen again.
Please go on.

18:03.917 --> 18:07.712
Well, there's nothing unholy
about expressing one's emotions.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.007
On the contrary,
religion should be experienced

18:11.174 --> 18:12.550
in an all-embracing way.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.678
We should feel free to
express our spirituality.

18:15.804 --> 18:18.598
Yes, darling.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.142
- Let me in!
- My husband!

18:21.309 --> 18:23.603
- You're married?
- Yes, I'm married.

18:23.812 --> 18:26.898
Ohh. We must pray for our sins.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.780
On second thought, God's often busy.

18:35.448 --> 18:39.410
- Out of my way, woman!
- No! Stop!

18:48.503 --> 18:51.923
Ahh! Thank you.
You broke my fall perfectly.

18:52.257 --> 18:54.926
- But I do apologize for the inconvenience.
- Get off of me!

18:56.302 --> 18:58.197
If there's one thing I can't abide,
it's rudeness.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.265
- You fell on me.
- And I apologized for it.

19:00.431 --> 19:01.791
Well, your apology's not accepted.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.602
I hope your sword is
as quick as your mouth.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.188
- It's quicker.
- Ahh.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.649
A duel then.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.359
A duel.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.988
Meet me behind the Carmes-Deschaux
monastery at 2:00.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.240
- I'll be there.
- As will I.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.495
Three duels in one day.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.307
Homesick?

19:43.141 --> 19:45.185
Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised me.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.854
I often have that effect on people.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.440
I can't imagine why.

19:54.235 --> 19:56.487
I'm really a very gentle person.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.039
You seem a little unhappy
in your new home.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.626
Lonely.
Is that the same thing?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.962
Austria's loss is France's gain.

20:14.088 --> 20:16.049
I'm not sure the king
shares your opinion.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.343
We've barely spoken
since our wedding day.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.054
Whenever we're together,
he seems so...

20:23.223 --> 20:24.349
uncertain.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.851
Arranged marriages can be difficult.

20:28.269 --> 20:29.896
Your father and I thought yours

20:30.730 --> 20:33.608
would bring Austria and France
closer together.

20:34.943 --> 20:37.362
Countries align more swiftly
than people, I'm afraid.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.279
What a pity.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.826
Love is, I think,

20:47.247 --> 20:49.791
wasted on the young.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.835
His majesty, the king.

20:54.671 --> 20:57.006
Cardinal Richelieu,
I've been looking for you.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.050
Your majesty.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.804
Anne, I didn't know you were here.

21:03.680 --> 21:07.016
- Would you like me to go?
- No. Please stay.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.769
Your eminence, I demand an answer.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.188
Perhaps if I knew the question.

21:12.522 --> 21:15.108
I just learned that you went ahead
and disbanded my Musketeers.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.319
- You approved the decision.
- But not the timing.

21:19.153 --> 21:22.198
I intended to address them myself
and explain the situation.

21:23.241 --> 21:26.369
These men are not just my personal guards.
They are my friends.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.831
A thousand apologies, your majesty.

21:30.915 --> 21:33.209
We are on the brink of war with England.

21:33.960 --> 21:37.547
The Duke of Buckingham plans
to invade La Rochelle within the month,

21:38.214 --> 21:42.093
and we'll need the Musketeers in the field
if we are to defeat him.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.680
I thought it best to act quickly.

21:45.805 --> 21:49.642
I will be the judge of what is best,
for me and for France!

21:54.814 --> 21:55.815
Of course.

21:57.275 --> 21:58.276
Forgive me.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.546
He is becoming as troublesome
as his father.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.798
He's a foolish boy and barely that.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.134
That foolish boy is about to become a man,

22:23.259 --> 22:25.345
which is all the more reason
for us to act quickly.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.057
- Have our loose ends been tied up?
- Two patrols have been sent.

22:31.559 --> 22:32.935
I trust, Captain Rochefort,

22:33.227 --> 22:36.564
that you are doing everything
in your power to rid us of these rebels.

22:37.648 --> 22:40.777
Don't let having only one eye
impair your vision.

22:42.236 --> 22:45.865
The loss of the other could be most...
inconvenient.

23:12.558 --> 23:13.726
What is this?

23:14.685 --> 23:18.106
We are having a private party,
celebrating the demise of the Musketeers.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.732
Go away.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.901
Athos, is that any way
to greet our guests?

23:22.568 --> 23:24.695
Gentlemen, don't be shy.
Come in.

23:25.363 --> 23:26.843
Your friends have been expecting you.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.366
You're under arrest.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.284
Under whose authority?

23:30.785 --> 23:32.036
Mine.

23:35.289 --> 23:38.084
Ah, hello again, Cyclops.

23:40.503 --> 23:43.506
Let's see. When was the last time
we had the pleasure of his company?

23:44.132 --> 23:47.051
I believe it was the day he was cast out
of the Musketeers.

23:47.218 --> 23:50.680
Conduct unbecoming a Musketeer.
That was the charge, was it not?

23:51.055 --> 23:53.683
You should know.
Three of you stood against me.

23:54.016 --> 23:55.476
It was the least we could do.

23:56.102 --> 23:59.730
You are hereby ordered to surrender
your tunics and your commissions at once.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.275
You can, of course, refuse,

24:02.692 --> 24:05.319
become outlaws, hunted men.

24:06.404 --> 24:07.822
But why not
come along quietly...

24:09.699 --> 24:11.033
For old times' sake?

24:19.792 --> 24:20.918
Did I miss anyone?

24:21.085 --> 24:23.921
Congratulations, Porthos.
You brought down the house.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.548
Oh, drat.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.425
I was trying to hit Rochefort.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.183
You go back, and you
tell the cardinal...

24:35.558 --> 24:37.768
We will continue
to perform our sworn duty,

24:37.894 --> 24:39.562
which is to protect the king.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.732
And we will use every means
within our power to fight him.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.443
Bold words.

24:46.861 --> 24:49.155
I look forward
to ramming them down your throat.

24:56.078 --> 24:59.499
Rochefort. Isn't that
a smelly kind of a cheese?

25:23.064 --> 25:24.732
Your manners
have not improved yet.

25:25.733 --> 25:28.027
- You're late.
- You in a hurry to die?

25:32.532 --> 25:34.242
Here come the grave diggers now.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.705
Athos, you cannot fight this boy.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.749
- Why not?
- I'm fighting him.

25:42.083 --> 25:43.167
Not until 1 o'clock.

25:43.459 --> 25:46.087
- I have a duel with him, too.
- Not until 2 o'clock.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.924
Let's get on with it then.

25:50.925 --> 25:53.427
Wouldn't want you to be late
for your future engagements.

25:56.556 --> 25:57.807
You're a Musketeer?

26:00.810 --> 26:02.144
You're all Musketeers?

26:02.687 --> 26:04.105
You choose your opponents well.

26:04.438 --> 26:07.650
- Or should I say foolishly?
- I've been looking all over for you.

26:07.942 --> 26:10.611
Now you've found us.
We have some business to attend to...

26:10.695 --> 26:12.976
Unless, of course,
you'd like to make it for a later date.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.324
No.
I'm a man of honor.

26:17.410 --> 26:20.130
But believe me when I say that
killing you will bring me no pleasure.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.558
I'll be with you
gentlemen in a moment.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.501
- Oh, he's a feisty little fellow.
- Feisty indeed.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.463
There they are!

26:33.634 --> 26:36.178
Only a fool would try and
arrest us twice in one day.

26:37.388 --> 26:38.556
You're under arrest.

26:39.473 --> 26:40.641
- A fool.
- A fool.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.481
The boy's of no interest to me.
He's free to go.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.854
You coming peacefully,
or do you intend to resist?

26:45.980 --> 26:47.791
Oh, don't be so stupid.
Of course we intend to resist.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.135
Just give us a moment, all right?

26:52.695 --> 26:54.455
Five of them, three of us.
Hardly seems fair.

26:54.530 --> 26:55.674
Maybe we should give them a chance

26:55.698 --> 26:56.698
- to surrender?
- Hmm.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.367
Excuse me, but there's four of us.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.421
It's not your fight.
You're not a Musketeer.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.330
I may not wear the tunic,

27:02.413 --> 27:04.213
but I believe I have
the heart of a Musketeer.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.625
- Warrior.
- Poet.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.376
You got a name, boy?

27:07.752 --> 27:08.752
D'Artagnan.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.884
- Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
- Hello.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.449
- Nice to meet you again.
- Pleasure.

27:17.178 --> 27:18.387
Everyone acquainted?

27:19.930 --> 27:22.058
Now we are prepared to resist you.

28:19.824 --> 28:20.825
Aha!

28:52.857 --> 28:53.899
Oh!

29:03.743 --> 29:06.662
Oh!
God, I love my work.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.519
Take a look at our young friend.

29:33.522 --> 29:35.232
My god, he's still alive.

30:00.758 --> 30:03.427
May the lord forgive you for any sins
you may have committed.

30:03.803 --> 30:04.845
Amen.

30:15.189 --> 30:16.232
What's he doing?

30:17.733 --> 30:20.486
Last rites.
Aramis takes death very seriously.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.488
Is he a priest?

30:22.988 --> 30:24.782
He used to be one of
the cardinal's students.

30:26.450 --> 30:27.827
You, boy,

30:28.536 --> 30:31.997
are arrogant, hot-tempered
and entirely too bold.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.834
I like that.
Reminds me of me.

30:35.459 --> 30:36.627
Don't encourage him.

30:36.877 --> 30:39.171
By helping us, the boy
has made himself an outlaw as well.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.049
- Not if he leaves Paris right now.
- I can't leave now.

30:42.466 --> 30:45.010
- I just got here.
- Go home. Find a wench.

30:45.219 --> 30:46.846
Raise fat babies.
Live a good long life.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.558
What about the motto of the Musketeers:
All for one and one for all?

30:51.016 --> 30:53.853
Wake up, boy.
The Musketeers are just a dream.

31:12.997 --> 31:14.290
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

31:14.415 --> 31:15.415
Hyah!

31:20.379 --> 31:22.214
Halt! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

31:25.467 --> 31:27.136
Long live the Musketeers!

31:28.512 --> 31:29.597
He's mine.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.201
Whoa, whoa!

32:16.602 --> 32:19.396
- My sword!
- It's magnificent.

32:20.564 --> 32:21.857
Where did you steal it?

32:23.150 --> 32:24.526
It belonged to my father.

32:26.403 --> 32:27.404
Your father.

32:29.531 --> 32:31.575
Well, now it belongs to me.

32:33.035 --> 32:34.620
I collect swords, you see.

32:35.496 --> 32:37.706
I take them from men I've killed.

32:38.415 --> 32:39.708
Well, I'm not dead yet.

32:39.959 --> 32:43.587
You and the Musketeers are responsible
for the killing of the cardinal's guards,

32:43.712 --> 32:45.214
an offense punishable by death.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.231
They interrupted a duel
we were fighting.

32:48.175 --> 32:51.470
- A deed also punishable by death.
- It's been a busy day.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.516
Tell me where to find
the Musketeers...

32:56.767 --> 32:59.478
And I will give you back
your father's sword.

33:01.689 --> 33:03.524
Give me back my father's sword...

33:04.233 --> 33:05.526
And I'll cut out your heart.

33:15.411 --> 33:16.411
Idiot.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.873
Like your father.

33:23.127 --> 33:25.212
- Take him below.
- Yes, sir.

33:52.823 --> 33:53.907
Hey, boy!

34:37.951 --> 34:38.951
Leave us.

34:55.552 --> 34:56.887
Milady de Winter.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.016
Your eminence.

35:01.850 --> 35:06.438
Your beauty would make
even the most chaste of men think of...

35:07.940 --> 35:09.108
Impurity.

35:09.525 --> 35:12.194
I don't believe you suffer
the burden of chastity.

35:15.489 --> 35:16.990
Perhaps you're right.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.456
I was making an observation,
not an offer.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.500
A word of caution, milady.

35:26.834 --> 35:30.963
A snap of my fingers and you could be
back on the block where I found you.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.674
And with a flick of my wrist,

35:34.049 --> 35:36.385
I could change your religion.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.307
You're very persuasive.

35:46.812 --> 35:50.524
For a moment, I forgot that your lovers
have a tendency to end up dead.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.819
Love has its risks.

35:54.611 --> 35:55.988
So does duty.

35:56.572 --> 35:59.032
The precision with which you
disposed of your husband,

35:59.324 --> 36:01.285
or should I say your ex-husband,

36:01.493 --> 36:04.329
Lord de Winter, was commendable,

36:04.872 --> 36:07.040
not to mention helpful to our cause.

36:07.166 --> 36:10.085
- I do what is necessary.
- Yes.

36:11.253 --> 36:13.630
I have a new mission
which requires your

36:14.131 --> 36:16.049
- singular talent.
- What is it?

36:16.383 --> 36:18.719
You will carry this treaty
to the Duke of Buckingham.

36:19.094 --> 36:20.971
You're making an alliance with England?

36:21.180 --> 36:22.806
The king has left me no choice.

36:23.307 --> 36:27.144
The boy is beginning to believe
that he should rule France instead of me.

36:27.311 --> 36:28.770
God forbid.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.939
You're to leave at once for Calais.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.600
A ship called the Persephone
will carry you to England.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.903
She sails Tuesday at midnight.

36:36.445 --> 36:38.363
Buckingham's signature
must be next to mine...

36:38.864 --> 36:40.490
Before the king's birthday Friday.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.701
Consider it done.

36:45.662 --> 36:49.249
And doing so will earn
you the gratitude...

36:50.626 --> 36:51.835
of a king.

36:52.419 --> 36:54.046
Until that day, your eminence.

36:54.421 --> 36:57.257
Or should I say, "your majesty"?

36:59.718 --> 37:01.887
Majesty sounds good.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.774
Looking for me?

37:14.399 --> 37:17.110
Kneel. Were you taught no respect
for a man of God?

37:18.403 --> 37:19.488
Cardinal Richelieu.

37:20.322 --> 37:21.865
How much did you overhear?

37:22.908 --> 37:25.911
Hardly a word, your eminence.
The voices were much too low.

37:26.036 --> 37:29.289
- And with all the noise from the prison...
- What's your name, boy?

37:30.290 --> 37:31.667
D'Artagnan.

37:33.377 --> 37:34.670
D'Artagnan.

37:38.924 --> 37:42.552
Oh, yes.
Your father was a Musketeer.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.846
He died while protecting the king.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.851
The dream of every warrior...

37:50.560 --> 37:53.021
dying nobly for king and country.

37:54.064 --> 37:55.274
Tell me, D'Artagnan.

37:55.565 --> 37:58.235
What noble business brings you here?

37:58.944 --> 38:01.029
I came to join
the king's Musketeers.

38:02.656 --> 38:04.241
Bad timing.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.201
So I've heard.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.662
Like the knights
of the round table,

38:09.246 --> 38:11.748
the Musketeers have
outlived their usefulness...

38:12.124 --> 38:13.792
And so have your three friends.

38:14.376 --> 38:17.379
Tell me where they are,
and I will spare your life.

38:18.255 --> 38:19.655
I can't tell you what I don't know.

38:19.881 --> 38:22.009
Give my regards to the headsman
and your father.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.176
Wait!

38:26.013 --> 38:29.308
- You object to losing your head?
- Yes. I like it where it is.

38:29.975 --> 38:34.062
Then tell me what I want to know,
and maybe you will keep it a while longer!

38:34.688 --> 38:35.808
I don't know where they are.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.483
And if you did?

38:43.905 --> 38:45.032
I wouldn't tell you.

38:47.576 --> 38:49.369
I admire your courage,
D'Artagnan.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.039
You might have made
a fine Musketeer.

38:52.456 --> 38:54.958
But now we'll never know, will we?

39:10.599 --> 39:11.767
They're bringing him down.

39:16.813 --> 39:19.107
It's your time, lad.
Step down.

39:25.781 --> 39:28.742
Milady left at midnight
by private coach.

39:29.618 --> 39:33.497
A remarkable woman.
The most beautiful I've ever known.

39:34.498 --> 39:35.916
And the deadliest.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.877
Which would explain my attraction.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.381
How is our young daredevil holding up?

39:43.965 --> 39:46.551
He's wishing he never
heard of the Musketeers.

40:12.536 --> 40:13.537
D'Artagnan!

40:15.414 --> 40:18.625
Don't lose your head!

40:21.128 --> 40:24.214
Fear not, my son.
For we are with you always.

40:24.881 --> 40:26.258
All for one...

40:27.759 --> 40:29.052
And one for all.

40:32.806 --> 40:36.810
Now this ax was a gift to me
from the czarina of Tokyo.

40:59.291 --> 41:00.417
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

41:01.418 --> 41:02.419
Hyah!

41:03.628 --> 41:04.963
My carriage!

41:07.215 --> 41:09.634
Gentlemen, your carriage,
compliments of the cardinal.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.348
Hyah! Hyah!

41:15.640 --> 41:18.602
Stop! Follow them!
Come on! Come on!

41:28.278 --> 41:29.988
D'Artagnan!

41:42.209 --> 41:46.004
Aha! The cardinal's
sacred snack chamber.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.214
And what have we here?

41:49.007 --> 41:51.218
Is he a man of God
or a man of gold?

41:55.555 --> 41:57.432
- Hyah!
- D'Artagnan!

41:57.849 --> 42:01.269
Would you be so kind
as to redistribute this wealth?

42:04.064 --> 42:06.191
Throw the coins, lad!
The people are hungry!

42:09.110 --> 42:10.195
Well done.

42:15.784 --> 42:18.703
Those Musketeers are a menace.
They must be stopped.

42:19.955 --> 42:22.165
The boy knows our plans.

42:22.707 --> 42:26.795
One thousand gold pieces
on each of their heads, dead or alive.

42:30.298 --> 42:32.467
I prefer dead.

42:39.266 --> 42:40.308
Hyah!

42:45.522 --> 42:48.817
Hyah! Hyah!

42:48.984 --> 42:50.277
They're firing at us!

42:51.695 --> 42:52.695
Champagne?

42:52.904 --> 42:54.823
We're in the middle
of a chase, Porthos.

42:56.366 --> 42:58.702
You're right. Something red.

43:13.717 --> 43:17.178
For a chase, the cardinal recommends
his excellent '24 cabernet.

43:17.512 --> 43:20.682
- You can't have any. You're too young.
- Take the reins, boy.

43:21.683 --> 43:22.726
Thank you.

43:45.665 --> 43:48.293
The picnic was delicious.
The champagne was excellent.

43:48.418 --> 43:50.086
Remind me to send
the cardinal a note.

43:50.170 --> 43:51.838
The cardinal! We have to hurry!

43:51.963 --> 43:53.256
You two have a date?

43:53.423 --> 43:55.623
No, it's the cardinal.
He's conspiring against the king!

43:55.675 --> 43:57.695
- Tell us something we don't know.
- He sent a messenger...

43:57.719 --> 44:00.013
with a secret treaty
to man named Buckingham.

44:00.722 --> 44:02.641
- The Duke of Buckingham?
- Do you know him?

44:02.974 --> 44:05.268
He rules England the way
the cardinal rules France.

44:05.477 --> 44:06.957
There's a ship called the Persephone.

44:07.187 --> 44:09.522
It's waiting in Calais
to take the messenger to England.

44:09.689 --> 44:11.232
It sails Tuesday midnight.

44:12.442 --> 44:14.712
We get that treaty, we can prove
the cardinal guilty of treason.

44:14.736 --> 44:16.488
Calais is over 200 leagues from here.

44:16.696 --> 44:19.050
Is the cardinal aware of the fact
that you have this information?

44:19.074 --> 44:20.116
Yes.

44:23.370 --> 44:24.245
Turn here.

44:24.329 --> 44:25.329
- Right here?
- Here!

44:29.751 --> 44:31.753
That's it.
Next time you drive.

45:01.199 --> 45:03.284
Hyah! Hyah!
Let's go! Hyah!

45:06.996 --> 45:08.081
Hyah!

45:09.541 --> 45:10.625
Hyah!

45:12.168 --> 45:13.503
Gimme the reins!

45:14.671 --> 45:16.673
- Hyah!
- Stop in the name of the cardinal!

45:17.549 --> 45:21.136
Hyah!

45:24.639 --> 45:27.058
- Over there! To your left!
- Stop the Musketeers!

45:31.604 --> 45:32.856
Hyah!

45:36.818 --> 45:39.529
Hyah! Hyah!

45:40.989 --> 45:42.407
Unhitch the horses.

45:46.953 --> 45:49.223
This is the end of the line, gentlemen.
I hope you enjoyed the ride.

45:49.247 --> 45:51.374
- Very much so. Thank you.
- Porthos, the brandy.

45:51.750 --> 45:53.209
Ooh, what a waste.

46:13.688 --> 46:15.732
Up the hill!
They're over there!

46:30.330 --> 46:33.291
- It's headed for the powder wagon!
- Run for it!

46:37.629 --> 46:39.088
Run for it!

46:59.943 --> 47:00.985
Hyah!

47:34.644 --> 47:38.439
Your eminence, the Musketeers
have been sighted on the road to Calais.

47:39.023 --> 47:40.567
Thanks to our winged friends,

47:41.067 --> 47:44.571
every mercenary and bounty hunter
in France will be waiting for them.

47:52.829 --> 47:53.997
All for one...

47:55.957 --> 47:57.876
And more for me.

48:17.645 --> 48:21.232
And I said, "Marquaise,

48:21.691 --> 48:23.735
"as I told you
at the sausage festival,

48:23.943 --> 48:26.905
"a queen is no different
from a barmaid in the dark,

48:27.113 --> 48:30.617
"though less practiced
in the arts of massage."

48:31.200 --> 48:34.621
Right? D'Artagnan, if you're going
to be a proper Musketeer,

48:34.746 --> 48:37.749
you shall have to be schooled in the manly
art of wenching. Right, ladies?

48:39.918 --> 48:41.961
Ooh. First subject.

48:42.462 --> 48:44.505
Very good.
Very good indeed.

48:44.923 --> 48:46.215
Let the schooling begin.

48:46.674 --> 48:49.177
The secret to wenching
is in the first kiss.

48:49.469 --> 48:51.804
For in that first kiss,
a lasting impression is made.

48:51.971 --> 48:53.097
Right, ladies?

48:53.556 --> 48:56.601
If it is... if it is weak,
she'll think you're weak.

48:57.226 --> 48:58.906
If it is comical,
she'll think you a clown.

48:58.978 --> 49:01.522
- With me?
- Weak, weak. Comical, clown.

49:02.607 --> 49:06.486
And as a Musketeer is never weak
and only rarely a clown,

49:07.612 --> 49:08.612
your first kiss...

49:09.030 --> 49:12.241
must be all the things
that you are, like this.

49:12.742 --> 49:15.078
Mmm.

49:29.384 --> 49:32.845
See? You may, uh,
speak first if you like...

49:32.971 --> 49:34.806
your name, her name,
an endearment or two.

49:35.181 --> 49:38.643
Trust me, words are a complete waste
of time at this sensitive point.

49:39.227 --> 49:41.354
Only the wrong words are
a complete waste of time.

49:42.438 --> 49:43.481
The right words

49:43.648 --> 49:46.409
can make a more lasting impression
than a thousand of Porthos' kisses.

49:46.526 --> 49:48.945
- Not likely.
- Ah, see?

49:49.362 --> 49:50.530
Shall I demonstrate?

49:58.913 --> 50:03.209
As morning hues of sun-swept fire
caress your passionate face,

50:03.501 --> 50:07.213
alone with thee a pure desire
to worship untold grace.

50:08.131 --> 50:11.968
My soul would cry in silent prayer
toward hours swept apart.

50:12.385 --> 50:16.180
Your essence warms the evening air
as I dance into your heart.

50:17.015 --> 50:18.307
Mmm.

50:19.559 --> 50:22.061
- Shakespeare.
- Aramis.

50:22.437 --> 50:24.564
- Cheating.
- It was beautiful.

50:24.814 --> 50:26.774
- Thank you.
- Mmm-mmm.

50:34.782 --> 50:36.993
Very well, D'Artagnan.
Your turn.

50:39.579 --> 50:40.747
Ahh!

50:51.049 --> 50:53.468
As morning hues of sun-swept...

50:54.802 --> 50:55.803
Fire.

50:55.970 --> 50:59.223
Fire caress your poisoned face...

51:05.354 --> 51:07.065
Bravo! The boy's a natural!

51:08.983 --> 51:11.819
Ohh! A lively tune.

51:12.320 --> 51:13.780
I'm inspired to dance.

51:29.504 --> 51:30.963
Why's Athos sittin' by himself?

51:32.215 --> 51:34.092
He takes his drinking
very seriously.

51:34.675 --> 51:37.678
Not to worry. He'll be his usual,
charming self by morning.

51:46.896 --> 51:48.856
Ho-ho-ho!
A lovely time!

51:50.233 --> 51:52.610
Athos, why don't you come join us?

51:54.237 --> 51:57.448
You fight like a man.
See if you can drink like one.

51:58.616 --> 52:00.785
I'll drink anything
you put in front of me.

52:02.245 --> 52:03.871
Famous last words.

52:05.623 --> 52:06.916
What should we drink to?

52:08.543 --> 52:09.919
Let's drink to love.

52:10.753 --> 52:12.880
To love.

52:14.090 --> 52:16.509
Let me tell you
a story about love, D'Artagnan.

52:17.552 --> 52:21.430
I knew a young man once, a count,
who feared he would never fall in love.

52:22.181 --> 52:24.892
One day, he met a woman.
This woman was more than beautiful.

52:25.017 --> 52:28.771
She was intoxicating, mysterious,
everything he'd ever dreamed of.

52:29.230 --> 52:31.291
He felt his heart would burst
if he couldn't have her.

52:31.315 --> 52:32.315
What happened?

52:32.650 --> 52:34.026
The poor idiot married her.

52:35.027 --> 52:36.947
Isn't that what people do
when they fall in love?

52:36.988 --> 52:38.239
Shut up and listen to me.

52:39.657 --> 52:41.701
They were riding
through the forest one day.

52:42.535 --> 52:44.655
She was thrown from her horse
and knocked unconscious.

52:45.454 --> 52:47.814
When he rushed to her side,
he noticed a mark on her body...

52:48.499 --> 52:49.768
something he'd never seen before,

52:49.792 --> 52:51.919
something she'd managed
to keep hidden all this time.

52:52.420 --> 52:55.464
- What was it?
- The brand of the fleur-de-lis,

52:56.132 --> 52:58.467
the mark given to those who
are to be executed for murder.

53:00.011 --> 53:02.513
The count was crushed.
The woman he loved, his bride,

53:03.389 --> 53:04.891
had betrayed him.
She'd lied to him.

53:05.600 --> 53:08.686
When she came to, she swore that she'd
been falsely accused of these crimes,

53:08.895 --> 53:10.563
but he didn't believe her.

53:10.897 --> 53:12.982
He rejected her for her lies
and for her past.

53:13.566 --> 53:15.234
Then he banished her
from his province.

53:18.237 --> 53:22.283
When the guards came to take
her away to be executed, she...

53:24.619 --> 53:26.954
she was still professing
her undying love.

53:32.293 --> 53:36.589
Soon after, the count realized how much
she had meant to him, but it was too late.

53:37.798 --> 53:40.593
His betrayal was far greater
than hers could ever have been.

53:41.969 --> 53:44.764
He gave up his title, his land,
everything he believed in,

53:45.806 --> 53:49.769
never to be seen or heard from again,
all because of love.

54:02.907 --> 54:05.201
Whoo! May I have this dance?

54:19.465 --> 54:20.841
How's your head, D'Artagnan?

54:21.759 --> 54:24.053
I'm beginning to wish
the cardinal had chopped it off.

54:24.387 --> 54:25.846
Would you stop whistling, please?

54:26.055 --> 54:28.015
- I'm not whistling.
- Well, somebody's whistling.

54:29.058 --> 54:31.686
- Barmaid's kiss left him dizzy.
- I hear it, too.

54:32.144 --> 54:33.646
Sounds like a cannonball.

54:37.358 --> 54:38.859
Oh, I hate cannonballs.

54:39.277 --> 54:40.319
Whoa!

54:44.782 --> 54:47.576
- The cardinal has a long reach.
- Get outta here!

54:52.707 --> 54:53.791
Flank left!

55:05.845 --> 55:06.929
Fire!

55:13.728 --> 55:15.521
There they are!
Kill the Musketeers!

55:15.855 --> 55:18.649
We'll split up.
D'Artagnan rides with me.

55:18.858 --> 55:20.484
- We'll see you in Calais.
- Or hell.

55:23.821 --> 55:25.906
Hyah!
Hyah!

55:30.453 --> 55:31.453
Split up!

55:32.705 --> 55:34.081
We need heads for the reward!

55:45.760 --> 55:47.553
The first time
you saw D'Artagnan,

55:48.095 --> 55:50.389
did you need the laces
in your corset loosened?

55:51.223 --> 55:53.726
Yes. And I felt
my cheeks flush.

55:53.976 --> 55:56.562
But your hands were cold.
My knees trembled.

55:56.937 --> 55:59.315
- But your heart was pounding.
- Yes.

56:00.775 --> 56:02.777
But I don't understand
why I feel this way.

56:04.028 --> 56:05.321
We only met for a moment.

56:05.821 --> 56:07.615
A moment is all it may take.

56:08.199 --> 56:09.241
Do you think so?

56:10.493 --> 56:12.244
When my father
promised me to Louis,

56:12.953 --> 56:14.080
I was furious.

56:15.331 --> 56:17.666
The thought of marrying
a complete stranger,

56:18.709 --> 56:20.544
someone I'd never even seen...

56:21.962 --> 56:23.506
I thought I'd never be happy...

56:24.715 --> 56:26.384
And that I'd never find love.

56:27.927 --> 56:31.138
But then the first time
I saw him and our eyes met,

56:31.305 --> 56:33.474
- I knew.
- What did you know?

56:35.101 --> 56:37.728
What you knew in your heart
when you first saw D'Artagnan.

56:39.438 --> 56:41.232
What if he doesn't feel the same?

56:42.942 --> 56:44.485
We must never give up hope.

56:48.364 --> 56:49.490
I'll get you your robe.

57:08.884 --> 57:11.220
What are you doing here?

57:12.138 --> 57:13.514
Forgive me, your majesty.

57:14.515 --> 57:15.933
I need your help...

57:16.934 --> 57:19.478
And could not, in good conscience,
wait another minute.

57:21.230 --> 57:22.440
On what matter?

57:23.357 --> 57:25.734
I'm worried about
the king's happiness.

57:26.193 --> 57:27.278
In what way?

57:28.612 --> 57:30.906
I'm afraid he's fallen
into a dreadful melancholy...

57:31.657 --> 57:34.034
And wishes to postpone
his birthday celebration.

57:34.994 --> 57:37.538
Perhaps he's concerned
with more important matters,

57:37.830 --> 57:39.248
like the coming war with England.

57:39.457 --> 57:41.792
Which is exactly why
the celebration must be held:

57:42.543 --> 57:44.753
To show the world
that the king of France...

57:44.879 --> 57:47.006
can face an enemy on any field,

57:47.882 --> 57:50.509
to show France who is king.

57:52.178 --> 57:53.596
He will listen to you.

57:56.765 --> 57:57.892
I will talk to him.

57:59.018 --> 58:00.018
Thank you.

58:02.563 --> 58:03.731
I've always said...

58:04.857 --> 58:06.317
that you are as intelligent...

58:08.569 --> 58:09.862
as you are beautiful.

58:11.739 --> 58:13.782
I'm not worthy
of such a compliment.

58:14.575 --> 58:16.243
Ah, but you are.

58:18.370 --> 58:21.707
It is difficult to be a man
in the service of God.

58:23.167 --> 58:24.877
It is assumed that certain...

58:25.252 --> 58:26.252
wants,

58:28.839 --> 58:29.840
desires,

58:30.549 --> 58:32.593
are void from my existence.

58:33.594 --> 58:36.972
But, after all, I'm still a man.

58:37.598 --> 58:40.184
Your sacrifice brings you closer to God.

58:41.143 --> 58:42.186
Yes.

58:44.897 --> 58:47.566
But it is not God
to whom I wish to be close.

58:50.402 --> 58:54.240
I want you to consider,
to know...

58:55.157 --> 58:57.993
all that we might
accomplish together.

59:00.871 --> 59:02.081
For France.

59:05.167 --> 59:06.502
I think you should leave.

59:14.426 --> 59:17.972
Remember, kings come and kings go,

59:18.556 --> 59:20.516
but one thing remains the same,

59:21.725 --> 59:23.852
and that is me.

59:36.365 --> 59:37.408
Hyah!

59:44.331 --> 59:46.458
- Do you think we lost them?
- I don't know.

59:46.667 --> 59:47.960
I hope we're close to Calais.

59:48.210 --> 59:50.421
My horse could use a rest,
and my rear is killing me.

59:50.838 --> 59:53.674
You're a good man, D'Artagnan,

59:54.550 --> 59:56.385
much like your father was.

59:56.760 --> 59:57.803
Hyah!

01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:02.641
You knew my father?

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:04.893
Only by reputation.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:07.354
His death was mourned
by all Musketeers.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.608
How did he die?

01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:13.110
He uncovered a plot
to assassinate the king.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:16.530
He was led into a trap
by a fellow Musketeer and then murdered.

01:00:16.864 --> 01:00:18.073
Musketeer?

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.828
Shit!

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:29.335
There they are!

01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:39.386
Well, we didn't lose them.

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:41.597
I'll try and hold them off
as long as possible.

01:00:41.889 --> 01:00:45.309
You ride on without me.
I can't leave you here, not like this.

01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:47.478
A Musketeer's first duty
is to protect the king.

01:00:47.936 --> 01:00:49.313
You ride on to Calais...

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:51.315
and intercept
the cardinal's messenger.

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:54.068
- There's too many of them!
- Go or I will shoot you myself!

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:03.577
- Take these.
- Don't let me down.

01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:07.539
- I'll never forget you.
- Go!

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:15.839
Hyah! Hyah!

01:01:34.942 --> 01:01:36.443
Hyah! Hyah!

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:45.911
Hyah!

01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:49.915
Hyah!

01:01:54.253 --> 01:01:55.337
Back.

01:01:57.256 --> 01:01:58.256
Advance.

01:01:59.091 --> 01:01:59.967
Yes.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:02.344
Now lunge.
One, two, three, four.

01:02:02.845 --> 01:02:04.138
Now disarm.

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:08.267
Excellent.

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:14.356
Forgive me for being late,
your majesty.

01:02:14.857 --> 01:02:18.235
I was wrestling
with an important affair of state.

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:20.571
Excuse us, please.

01:02:30.164 --> 01:02:31.248
Your eminence,

01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:35.794
I've been hearing some very
troubling rumors about you.

01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:38.672
There are so many to choose from.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.842
Betrayal.

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:47.181
Ah, yes, that is usually the first.

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:50.392
Let me see if I
remember it correctly.

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:53.729
While the English attack from without,

01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:56.648
the wicked cardinal
undermines from within,

01:02:57.149 --> 01:03:01.570
forging a secret alliance with Buckingham
and placing himself on the throne.

01:03:02.154 --> 01:03:04.615
But really, your majesty,
why stop there.

01:03:04.782 --> 01:03:07.868
I have heard much more
festive variations.

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:11.497
I make oaths with pagan gods,

01:03:12.206 --> 01:03:14.208
seduce the queen
in her own chamber,

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.877
teach pigs to dance
and horses to fly...

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:21.215
and keep the moon carefully hidden
within the folds of my robe.

01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:24.468
- Have I forgotten anything?
- It does seem rather far-fetched.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:30.098
Sire, if there are any
doubts about my loyalty,

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:31.892
they will be laid to rest

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:34.645
when we appear together
to celebrate your birthday.

01:03:34.895 --> 01:03:36.498
Oh, my birthday.
You know, I've been meaning

01:03:36.522 --> 01:03:37.582
- to speak to you...
- The queen.

01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:40.818
Has just been telling me
how eager she is to attend.

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:45.155
Anne is coming?

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:49.743
The entire nation is anxious
to celebrate the birth of its king.

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.871
It will be an event to remember.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:55.707
I promise.

01:04:27.531 --> 01:04:29.283
Hyah! Hyah!

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:35.873
Whoa! Whoa!

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.585
What is it, Henri?

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:41.920
There's a body
in the road, milady.

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:52.890
It's a young man.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:56.143
He appears to be injured.

01:04:57.686 --> 01:04:58.937
He's handsome.

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:02.149
Put him inside.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:04.902
With me.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:34.640
Welcome back.

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:36.934
Did you dream?

01:05:39.061 --> 01:05:40.187
Where am I?

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:42.064
We're in Calais.

01:05:43.315 --> 01:05:44.650
Calais?

01:05:47.194 --> 01:05:48.946
Tuesday at midnight!

01:05:52.741 --> 01:05:53.951
Where are my clothes?

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:00.749
Do you have a name or shall I
make one up for you?

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:04.211
My name is D'Artagnan.

01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:07.047
D'Artagnan. I like that.

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:11.176
I'm the Countess de Winter, Milady.

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:13.720
- Countess?
- By marriage.

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:17.766
- But my husband's dead.
- I'm sorry.

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:20.102
I've learned to live with death.

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:25.148
Uh, Milady, I'm grateful
for all that you've done,

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:26.984
- but I've got...
- What?

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:29.403
Important business.

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:32.239
How mysterious.

01:06:33.115 --> 01:06:34.658
Does it require clothes?

01:06:36.535 --> 01:06:37.869
Yes, I need my clothes.

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:40.831
I'm afraid they won't be ready
for at least an hour.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:44.042
Until then, you're my prisoner.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:46.378
Would the prisoner care for a drink?

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:50.048
Well, I am thirsty.

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:54.678
What brings you to Calais?

01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:57.806
I'm on a mission for the king.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:01.893
I've heard that before.

01:07:02.728 --> 01:07:04.646
- I'm serious.
- You're young.

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:07.941
Young men are given
to exaggeration.

01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:11.194
However, if you'd like
to entertain me with a story,

01:07:11.987 --> 01:07:13.155
I love a good adventure.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:15.991
I came to Calais to stop a spy.

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:20.203
- A spy?
- Yes.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:25.584
I believe you. Aren't you afraid?

01:07:26.168 --> 01:07:29.129
- A Musketeer isn't afraid of anything.
- I knew it.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:32.257
I knew you were a Musketeer
the moment I saw you.

01:07:33.842 --> 01:07:35.635
- You did?
- Of course.

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:40.098
But D'Artagnan, if this spy were to
find out you were here,

01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:42.934
your life could be
in grave danger.

01:07:43.435 --> 01:07:45.020
A Musketeer isn't afraid of danger.

01:07:46.146 --> 01:07:47.397
I'm dangerous.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:50.400
Aren't you afraid of me?

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:52.903
You're not dangerous.

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:54.946
Then what am I?

01:08:00.452 --> 01:08:01.536
You're beautiful.

01:08:02.162 --> 01:08:03.997
Beauty. Danger.

01:08:05.165 --> 01:08:06.458
They are the same.

01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:18.428
Milady, I'm sorry...

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:30.023
Oh, my god!

01:08:30.148 --> 01:08:32.274
Parker!

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:46.997
Kill him.

01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:49.084
You can kill me,
but a surprise waits for you

01:08:49.209 --> 01:08:51.002
that even Buckingham
can't prevent.

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:53.337
You're young and vain,

01:08:54.506 --> 01:08:56.466
but I don't know
if you're clever.

01:08:57.134 --> 01:08:58.844
I know how you love
a good adventure.

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:02.055
Take him with us.

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:05.809
The bodyguards are
waiting outside, Milady.

01:09:05.934 --> 01:09:06.977
All right.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.188
Can I help you, Lord de Winter?

01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:12.774
- Milady de Winter, is she here?
- Oh, no.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:15.569
- I've not seen her.
- She murdered my brother, old man!

01:09:15.986 --> 01:09:18.279
Let's take the back stairs.

01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:45.974
Whoa!

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:06.369
We are the Countess de Winter's party,
arrived from Paris.

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:08.288
Permission to come aboard?

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.249
Permission granted.

01:10:23.762 --> 01:10:25.555
Take us to your captain.

01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:30.185
What are you, deaf?

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:36.149
Dead.
They're all dead!

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:38.276
Not all of us.

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:01.132
Porthos the pirate!

01:11:08.098 --> 01:11:10.267
- Pirate?
- I told you I was famous.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:07.657
Sabine.

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:09.533
Athos.

01:12:13.538 --> 01:12:14.622
Stop!

01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:25.008
I thought you were dead.

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:27.969
Cardinal Richelieu
took pity on me.

01:12:30.472 --> 01:12:31.723
You're the spy.

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:34.726
I've learned the value of lies.

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.269
They've kept me alive.

01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:39.773
The treaty, give it to me.

01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:43.443
No.

01:12:44.903 --> 01:12:46.029
I will shoot.

01:12:48.198 --> 01:12:49.324
Be kind.

01:12:50.909 --> 01:12:52.118
Aim for my heart.

01:12:59.834 --> 01:13:02.212
Countess de Winter.

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:05.131
I will not be so kind.

01:13:10.804 --> 01:13:12.389
The treaty outlines
Richelieu's plan

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.224
to forge an alliance
with Buckingham.

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:16.768
- No mention of the king?
- None.

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.561
However, the agreement is contingent...

01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:20.939
upon a demonstration
of the cardinal's power.

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:23.108
A demonstration?

01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:26.236
- What kind of demonstration?
- I don't know.

01:13:30.532 --> 01:13:32.242
I know someone who does.

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.705
I wish to speak with your prisoner.

01:13:39.374 --> 01:13:40.708
She dies in the morning.

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:10.947
There was a time I would have
given my life for a kind word from you.

01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:14.242
I could not give it.

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:16.411
I was a fool.

01:14:20.582 --> 01:14:22.542
Is it true what he says?
Did you kill his brother?

01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:24.711
I have become the nightmare...

01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:27.422
you once thought me to be.

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:29.924
But not before.

01:14:30.842 --> 01:14:31.885
Not us.

01:14:32.469 --> 01:14:33.553
No.

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:40.310
Do you know of the cardinal's plans?

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:41.978
I do.

01:14:42.687 --> 01:14:43.730
Tell me.

01:14:44.481 --> 01:14:45.940
Will you have my life spared?

01:14:49.611 --> 01:14:50.695
No, I cannot.

01:14:52.906 --> 01:14:55.158
Society demands swift justice.

01:14:57.452 --> 01:14:59.662
I'll take my secret to the grave.

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:06.127
Sabine...

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:10.340
You will die for your crimes.

01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:13.593
There is nothing
I can do about that now.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:16.804
But how you choose
to leave this world is up to you.

01:15:19.224 --> 01:15:21.184
What has this world ever done for me?

01:16:29.586 --> 01:16:32.297
"I am the resurrection and the life,"
sayeth the lord.

01:16:32.964 --> 01:16:35.717
"He who believeth in me
shall never die."

01:16:36.676 --> 01:16:38.261
We forgive you for your crimes.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:40.388
Die in peace.

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:46.477
On your knees.

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:06.789
No!

01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:10.960
- What is this?
- Sabine, forgive me, please.

01:17:14.005 --> 01:17:15.798
I do forgive you.

01:17:29.937 --> 01:17:32.649
The cardinal intends
to assassinate the king...

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.693
on Friday at his birthday celebration.

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.469
God's justice be done.

01:18:02.762 --> 01:18:03.805
Amen.

01:18:24.742 --> 01:18:27.954
The king's life is in danger.
We have work to do.

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:38.631
- Impressive.
- He can do that every time.

01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:41.509
- And he has no qualms about...
- None.

01:18:42.427 --> 01:18:44.637
He believes a man should honor
no kings before God.

01:18:45.179 --> 01:18:48.057
A man of faith.
How reassuring.

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:54.355
Whatever you're paying him,
double it.

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:57.817
I want the king's birthday
to be a memorable event.

01:18:59.152 --> 01:19:03.156
And rehang this painting
in my chamber.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:05.742
Just as it is.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:09.287
He was always
a little too flattering.

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:17.754
Horsemen!

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:27.680
Over here!
What does it say?

01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:19.273
Well, over there.

01:20:20.233 --> 01:20:22.610
Search the perimeter.
I'll try to find the king.

01:20:23.027 --> 01:20:24.445
- But...
- Go!

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:49.679
You look beautiful.

01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:51.514
Thank you.

01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:55.268
Is something wrong?

01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:02.984
- Cardinal Richelieu.
- Yes?

01:21:05.319 --> 01:21:07.154
He is an evil man.

01:21:08.322 --> 01:21:09.907
Do not believe
every rumor you hear.

01:21:12.076 --> 01:21:13.369
He is powerful.

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:16.539
I ride through the countryside every day.

01:21:16.664 --> 01:21:18.499
I've seen the uses of his power.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:20.209
Power sometimes frightens.

01:21:21.127 --> 01:21:22.795
Here in the palace I've seen it too.

01:21:26.132 --> 01:21:27.425
I know.

01:21:28.092 --> 01:21:30.344
- What should we do?
- I'm not sure.

01:21:31.846 --> 01:21:33.431
We will do it together.

01:23:17.535 --> 01:23:19.120
Get back!

01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:22.317
Captain, protect their majesties!

01:23:22.415 --> 01:23:23.624
- Richelieu!
- Get them inside!

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:36.595
Kill those Musketeers!
They're trying to murder the king!

01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:02.329
Save the king!

01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:48.292
Go with God.

01:24:52.088 --> 01:24:54.131
Aha!

01:24:57.259 --> 01:24:59.804
I like this.

01:25:38.551 --> 01:25:41.053
I think our young friend
could use some help.

01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:43.889
Hold this.

01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:06.912
It's about time!

01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:10.082
Come, D'Artagnan!
We're saving the king!

01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:22.720
You have failed.

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:26.348
Oh, you are so naive.

01:26:27.975 --> 01:26:30.936
Things couldn't be more perfect
if I'd planned them myself.

01:26:31.896 --> 01:26:36.525
The king of France dies
at the hands of his own personal guard.

01:26:37.735 --> 01:26:39.612
Grief stricken, terrified,

01:26:40.112 --> 01:26:42.323
the huddled masses turn for comfort...

01:26:42.823 --> 01:26:45.284
to their devout spiritual leader...

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:49.205
who, ever so humbly,

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:51.957
assumes the throne...

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:57.254
- with the queen by his side.
- I would rather die.

01:26:57.796 --> 01:26:59.632
That can be arranged!

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:09.266
But first your reluctant
husband will be found...

01:27:10.184 --> 01:27:13.354
pierced through the heart
by the sword of a Musketeer.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.022
The same sword

01:27:15.356 --> 01:27:17.274
that failed to protect his father.

01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:39.922
Ha!

01:27:43.259 --> 01:27:44.760
I hope we're not interrupting.

01:27:44.969 --> 01:27:48.055
No, on the contrary.
You're right on time.

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:23.841
Follow me.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:27.845
No!

01:28:58.375 --> 01:28:59.793
Leaving so soon?

01:29:00.002 --> 01:29:02.588
Oh, you know I abhor bloodshed.

01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:04.340
Especially your own.

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:06.133
Stand aside.

01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:09.803
You are under arrest,
charged with treason.

01:29:12.222 --> 01:29:14.892
You, of all people,
should know that the cardinal

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:17.186
does not answer
to the laws of men.

01:29:19.146 --> 01:29:20.606
Then you'll answer to God.

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.075
You first.

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.011
Aramis.

01:30:17.871 --> 01:30:19.248
This sword belongs to me.

01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:21.500
So it does.

01:30:41.603 --> 01:30:44.523
Let's see if you're as brave
a man as your father was.

01:30:46.358 --> 01:30:47.818
And as foolish.

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:01.039
Is he dead?

01:31:02.541 --> 01:31:05.169
Gently, gently.

01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:09.298
Oh! You see?

01:31:10.174 --> 01:31:11.675
There is a God.

01:31:26.815 --> 01:31:28.817
We're being followed.
Do something about it.

01:31:56.637 --> 01:31:57.804
My God.

01:31:58.931 --> 01:32:00.265
Which one do we take?

01:32:00.891 --> 01:32:03.227
- I've never been here before.
- Split up.

01:32:16.114 --> 01:32:19.034
Whoa, ugly.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:25.791
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:34.466
Oh!

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:38.720
Ha-ha!

01:32:43.267 --> 01:32:46.061
You smelly...

01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:48.522
lump of lard!

01:33:40.824 --> 01:33:41.992
Impressive.

01:33:55.631 --> 01:33:56.965
Damn it!

01:34:09.186 --> 01:34:11.647
How pathetic.

01:34:12.439 --> 01:34:14.650
Killed by the same man
that killed his father.

01:34:15.567 --> 01:34:18.236
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
- You killed my father?

01:34:19.071 --> 01:34:22.240
Oh, yes. As I will you.

01:34:41.718 --> 01:34:46.014
Well, well,
one thing is certain.

01:34:46.264 --> 01:34:47.933
You are no Musketeer.

01:34:56.566 --> 01:34:59.611
I might have been mistaken.

01:35:17.379 --> 01:35:19.423
For you, father.

01:35:51.663 --> 01:35:53.081
Let us out of here!

01:36:19.858 --> 01:36:21.943
Hyah! Hyah!

01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:26.114
Hyah! Ah!

01:36:27.657 --> 01:36:29.075
Where have you been?

01:36:29.451 --> 01:36:31.369
Taking care of something ugly.

01:36:37.959 --> 01:36:39.211
Richelieu!

01:36:39.586 --> 01:36:41.713
You're too late, Musketeers!

01:36:42.214 --> 01:36:45.217
By now the Duke of Buckingham's signature
is next to mine.

01:36:45.467 --> 01:36:47.344
The alliance is complete!

01:36:47.511 --> 01:36:50.639
That would be difficult considering
the treaty never left France!

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:53.475
A minor problem!

01:36:54.184 --> 01:36:56.645
I will return twice as strong...

01:36:56.895 --> 01:36:59.731
and the throne will be mine!

01:37:02.234 --> 01:37:03.610
I think not.

01:37:09.699 --> 01:37:13.829
You will never harm
another soul ever again.

01:37:14.412 --> 01:37:16.873
- My promise to God.
- Wait!

01:37:25.757 --> 01:37:27.425
Well done, your majesty.

01:37:34.099 --> 01:37:35.350
Are you all right?

01:37:37.352 --> 01:37:38.436
Yes.

01:37:58.665 --> 01:37:59.791
Arise.

01:38:02.878 --> 01:38:04.588
Is this the man who saved my life?

01:38:05.505 --> 01:38:07.173
His name's D'Artagnan, sire.

01:38:08.425 --> 01:38:10.260
D'Artagnan, I'm in your debt.

01:38:11.094 --> 01:38:13.221
What can I do to repay
the courage you've shown me?

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:18.935
Your majesty,
his heart has but one desire.

01:38:19.811 --> 01:38:21.605
And that is to become a Musketeer.

01:38:23.023 --> 01:38:24.232
Then approach.

01:38:28.278 --> 01:38:29.362
Kneel.

01:38:37.787 --> 01:38:40.665
This world is an uncertain realm
filled with danger.

01:38:41.374 --> 01:38:43.710
Honor undermined by the pursuit of power.

01:38:44.377 --> 01:38:47.297
Freedom sacrificed when the weak
are oppressed by the strong.

01:38:49.049 --> 01:38:51.384
But there are those who oppose
these powerful forces,

01:38:52.802 --> 01:38:56.473
who dedicate their lives to truth,
honor and freedom.

01:38:58.308 --> 01:39:00.477
These men are known as Musketeers.

01:39:06.232 --> 01:39:07.525
Rise, D'Artagnan,

01:39:09.653 --> 01:39:10.862
and join them.

01:39:52.404 --> 01:39:53.989
Your father would be proud of you.

01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:55.573
You're a Musketeer.

01:39:56.157 --> 01:39:58.159
What do we do now?
What's next?

01:39:59.244 --> 01:40:01.579
- Well, we protect the king.
- We protect the queen.

01:40:02.247 --> 01:40:05.208
- In the name of God.
- And France. Correct?

01:40:05.542 --> 01:40:07.043
- France, indeed.
- D'Artagnan!

01:40:11.673 --> 01:40:13.925
My sister's honor will not
wait a moment longer!

01:40:15.635 --> 01:40:17.512
- I'll handle this.
- D'Artagnan...

01:40:18.722 --> 01:40:20.098
We also protect each other.

01:40:24.853 --> 01:40:26.021
All for one...

01:40:26.646 --> 01:40:27.981
And one for all!

01:40:31.484 --> 01:40:32.569
Run!

01:40:56.301 --> 01:40:58.887
When it's love you give

01:40:59.095 --> 01:41:02.557
I'll be a man of good faith

01:41:02.724 --> 01:41:05.393
When in love you live

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.313
I'll make a stand I won't break

01:41:08.605 --> 01:41:13.234
I'll be the rock you can build on

01:41:13.568 --> 01:41:14.778
Yeah

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:21.701
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold

01:41:21.785 --> 01:41:24.579
When there's love inside

01:41:24.662 --> 01:41:27.749
I swear I'll always be strong

01:41:27.916 --> 01:41:30.919
Then there's a reason why

01:41:31.044 --> 01:41:34.089
I'll prove to you we belong

01:41:34.339 --> 01:41:38.635
I'll be the wall that protects you

01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:40.178
Yeah

01:41:41.387 --> 01:41:44.182
From the wind and the rain

01:41:44.641 --> 01:41:47.727
From the hurt and the pain

01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:49.854
- Yeah
- Hey

01:41:51.815 --> 01:41:55.276
Let's make it all for one

01:41:55.401 --> 01:41:57.403
And all for love

01:41:59.906 --> 01:42:03.993
Let the one you hold
Be the one you want

01:42:05.036 --> 01:42:07.038
The one you need

01:42:07.956 --> 01:42:11.334
'Cause when it's all for one

01:42:11.459 --> 01:42:13.336
It's one for all

01:42:14.754 --> 01:42:17.757
When there's someone that should know

01:42:18.007 --> 01:42:20.802
Then just let your feelings show

01:42:21.094 --> 01:42:24.180
And make it all for one

01:42:24.389 --> 01:42:26.307
And all for love

01:42:29.144 --> 01:42:31.896
When it's love you make

01:42:32.063 --> 01:42:35.400
I'll be the fire in your night

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:38.194
Then it's love you take

01:42:38.361 --> 01:42:41.322
I will defend I will fight

01:42:41.573 --> 01:42:46.161
I'll be there when you need me

01:42:46.536 --> 01:42:47.704
Yeah

01:42:48.872 --> 01:42:51.291
When honor's at stake

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.794
This vow I will make

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.921
Yeah

01:42:59.632 --> 01:43:02.635
That it's all for one

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.596
And all for love

01:43:05.346 --> 01:43:07.056
It's all for love

01:43:07.265 --> 01:43:11.102
Let the one you hold
Be the one you want

01:43:12.187 --> 01:43:14.647
The one you need

01:43:15.190 --> 01:43:18.568
'Cause when it's all for one

01:43:18.735 --> 01:43:21.654
- It's one for all
- Yeah

01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:24.949
When there's someone that should know

01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:28.161
Then just let your feelings show

01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:31.331
And make it all for one

01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:33.625
And all for love

01:43:36.461 --> 01:43:40.798
Don't lay our love to rest

01:43:40.965 --> 01:43:44.302
'Cause we could stand up to the test

01:43:44.552 --> 01:43:47.138
We got everything

01:43:47.722 --> 01:43:49.224
And more

01:43:49.766 --> 01:43:53.269
Than we had planned

01:43:53.728 --> 01:43:55.980
More than the rivers

01:43:56.105 --> 01:43:59.067
That run the land

01:44:00.193 --> 01:44:02.362
We got it all

01:44:02.612 --> 01:44:05.281
- In our hands
- Yeah

01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:32.350
Now it's all for one

01:44:32.433 --> 01:44:34.602
And all for love

01:44:34.978 --> 01:44:36.562
It's all for love

01:44:37.105 --> 01:44:40.942
Let the one you hold
Be the one you want

01:44:41.985 --> 01:44:44.279
The one you need

01:44:45.071 --> 01:44:48.366
'Cause when it's all for one

01:44:48.449 --> 01:44:51.744
- It's one for all
- It's one for all

01:44:51.869 --> 01:44:54.956
When there's someone that should know

01:44:55.081 --> 01:44:57.667
Then just let your feelings show

01:44:57.834 --> 01:45:01.129
When there's someone that you want

01:45:01.421 --> 01:45:04.132
When there's someone that you need

01:45:04.257 --> 01:45:09.721
Let's make it all

01:45:10.388 --> 01:45:13.349
All for one

01:45:16.352 --> 01:45:22.608
And all for love
