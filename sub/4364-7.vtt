WEBVTT

00:01.078 --> 00:04.803
George Plantagenet, I curse you.

00:06.084 --> 00:07.204
Annie!

00:08.795 --> 00:10.115
It was a boy.

00:11.435 --> 00:13.834
You've always been determined to
paint him as a villain.

00:13.835 --> 00:15.794
He managed that well enough himself.

00:15.795 --> 00:19.194
You went against us,
down on your knees for Warwick,

00:19.195 --> 00:21.874
when you thought that he would
make you King. Richard.

00:21.875 --> 00:23.274
Will you marry me?

00:23.275 --> 00:26.714
If I marry you,
everything I have becomes yours.

00:26.715 --> 00:29.434
But I will be a true husband
because I love you.

00:29.434 --> 00:30.874
The Queen's baby is coming early.

00:31.275 --> 00:32.594
He's dying, Mother.

00:32.995 --> 00:35.594
It's a comfort to know that
they're both with God.

00:35.595 --> 00:37.435
No!

00:38.635 --> 00:40.474
Lord Thomas Stanley.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.914
I hope I will please you as a wife.

00:42.915 --> 00:44.954
I will judge what
I can do for your son

00:44.955 --> 00:48.234
and, in due course, what
rewards your son can offer me.

00:48.235 --> 00:51.594
You will be required to take up
a place in the Queen's chamber

00:51.595 --> 00:53.394
and, to all appearances, be a loyal

00:53.395 --> 00:55.874
and faithful
member of the House of York.

00:55.875 --> 00:59.315
Then I will be patient and endeavour
to rise in their favour.

02:08.866 --> 02:09.907
Edward!

02:28.947 --> 02:30.706
A toast!

02:30.707 --> 02:35.506
To my Queen and wife who, even now,
is upstairs, giving birth to

02:35.507 --> 02:37.627
another son and heir for me.

02:38.907 --> 02:40.067
The Queen.

02:40.267 --> 02:41.347
The Queen.

02:52.787 --> 02:54.322
I can't give birth
without my mother here.

02:54.322 --> 02:55.523
I'm.. I'm afraid.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.325
Lizzie, you'll have to, somehow.
Perhaps if...

02:58.325 --> 03:00.250
If you're going to tell me
to pray again, I swear to you...

03:00.250 --> 03:02.807
Some lavender from the garden,
Lady Margaret?

03:02.867 --> 03:04.574
I do not want you in here!

03:06.567 --> 03:08.167
I think you've made that
plain enough.

03:21.047 --> 03:22.726
Why are you not with the Queen?

03:22.727 --> 03:24.886
Oh, she has sent me
on a fool's errand.

03:24.887 --> 03:28.566
Lavender because her mother said
the scent aids birth.

03:28.567 --> 03:30.286
Smile, Margaret. We are
their friends

03:30.287 --> 03:31.606
and you must make her love you.

03:31.607 --> 03:34.326
And I have tried but she will not.

03:34.327 --> 03:36.347
She loves only her own vanity.

03:38.727 --> 03:41.166
I don't believe that this is
the best way to celebrate

03:41.167 --> 03:42.326
the birth of your child.

03:42.327 --> 03:44.806
Oh, come on, Richard.
Don't be such a sour mouth!

03:44.807 --> 03:47.486
Actually, Edward, he's right.

03:47.487 --> 03:49.846
Half of England's already
calling you a wastrel.

03:49.847 --> 03:52.166
This is not what we fought for.

03:52.167 --> 03:54.006
Yes, it is! Peace and plenty.

03:54.007 --> 03:55.406
It's exactly what we fought...

03:55.407 --> 03:59.126
Whoring? Really?
What about a legacy?

03:59.127 --> 04:01.566
Don't you want to be remembered?
I will be remembered.

04:01.567 --> 04:03.766
Yeah, for being fat and lazy.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.367
And what do you suggest, George?

04:07.727 --> 04:09.606
We take France.

04:09.607 --> 04:13.526
Right the wrongs that mad old Henry
did to this country when he lost it.

04:13.527 --> 04:14.766
Win back our honour.

04:14.767 --> 04:18.766
A very sudden interest in the honour
of your country, George.

04:18.767 --> 04:20.406
Could there be
something in it for you?

04:20.406 --> 04:22.966
Why not?
You both have enough already.

04:22.967 --> 04:25.846
If we take... When we take France,
you will need a Regent.

04:25.847 --> 04:28.206
I could do that,
seeing as you'll be busy being King

04:28.207 --> 04:31.424
and he's got ten titles as well
as the whole of the North
of England virtually to himself.

04:31.424 --> 04:33.727
Have you been counting, George?

04:36.287 --> 04:42.807
France. Reclaim our land.
Perhaps we should.

04:44.087 --> 04:45.927
Stanley... Your Grace.

04:58.647 --> 05:03.927
He may have forgotten your turn to
Warwick but I have not.

05:05.727 --> 05:08.942
And I've not forgotten that
you've got Warwick Castle

05:08.942 --> 05:11.847
despite the fact that that
title belongs to me.

05:14.807 --> 05:17.686
You both have more
than your fair share already,

05:17.687 --> 05:20.047
so maybe it's time
I started to take things.

05:31.607 --> 05:34.167
Give me a sign that
I was right in coming here.

05:38.407 --> 05:40.286
Lady Margaret? The baby's stuck.

05:40.287 --> 05:42.287
We must toss the Queen in a blanket.

05:56.927 --> 05:59.006
That's it! Nearly there!

05:59.007 --> 06:03.527
Harder. Push! He's here.
He's here, Your Grace.

06:04.967 --> 06:06.207
Oh, it's a boy!

06:09.607 --> 06:13.527
My Richard. Where is his cry?

06:14.807 --> 06:16.166
It's all right.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.366
Why isn't he crying?

06:18.367 --> 06:20.567
Am I cursed?

06:22.927 --> 06:25.206
Will all my children die now?

06:25.207 --> 06:26.247
Lady Margaret.

06:27.767 --> 06:28.967
It's all right, Your Grace.

06:39.527 --> 06:40.567
Help my boy.

06:43.847 --> 06:44.887
No!

07:07.847 --> 07:10.887
He lives.
He's all right, Your Grace.

07:12.327 --> 07:13.727
He lives. You have a son.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.127
Thank you.

07:19.847 --> 07:24.246
Oh, you willed my boy to life.
I'm sorry.

07:24.247 --> 07:25.447
I'm sorry.

07:27.287 --> 07:28.327
I'm in your debt.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.567
I only wish to serve, Your Grace.

07:51.247 --> 07:52.526
How's our boy?

07:52.527 --> 07:53.647
He is well.

07:55.487 --> 07:56.567
There.

08:00.367 --> 08:03.366
He is small but he will grow.

08:03.367 --> 08:04.607
I am sure of it.

08:06.567 --> 08:07.607
I missed you.

08:10.807 --> 08:14.446
But I am so happy here, Richard,
away from the court.

08:14.447 --> 08:16.046
I feel so hopeful.

08:16.047 --> 08:19.327
Anne, I have something
I must tell you.

08:20.607 --> 08:22.486
I've brought someone with me and...

08:22.487 --> 08:24.607
Oh, Richard, please. Not your
mother!

08:30.407 --> 08:33.207
They told me you had had a child.

08:35.246 --> 08:37.366
You didn't bring him
for my blessing.

08:41.006 --> 08:43.086
My mother cursed me and disowned me.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.726
Why on earth have you
brought her here?

08:44.727 --> 08:46.766
George was planning to snatch
her from the Abbey

08:46.767 --> 08:48.526
so he could steal her fortune.

08:48.527 --> 08:51.286
He thinks because he has the title
Earl of Warwick that he can

08:51.287 --> 08:53.966
have all your mother's money
to himself.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.446
So the King
and I have acted to ensure that you

08:56.447 --> 08:59.446
and your sister will share
it as you should.

08:59.447 --> 09:02.206
So to stop George snatching her,
you have done so?

09:02.207 --> 09:04.926
You do not need to see her.

09:04.927 --> 09:07.846
You do not
even need to know that she is here.

09:07.847 --> 09:09.727
She's our prisoner under guard.

09:12.287 --> 09:14.887
I brought her here for your sake.

09:40.887 --> 09:42.407
I tried to come and see you.

09:44.527 --> 09:47.647
You brought me here
so you can steal my fortune.

09:51.167 --> 09:52.807
You left me on a battlefield!

09:53.847 --> 09:57.966
I was a child,
alone, in terror for my life,

09:57.967 --> 09:59.527
and you ran away to save yourself.

10:00.887 --> 10:02.047
You will release me.

10:03.327 --> 10:05.846
It is not my will to have you here
but Richard's,

10:05.847 --> 10:08.687
so you must accept whatever
he thinks best for you.

10:11.247 --> 10:13.446
Even if I must be dead?

10:13.447 --> 10:14.926
What?

10:14.927 --> 10:19.126
It is how we resolve the problem
of your mother's fortune.

10:19.127 --> 10:22.606
The King will pass an Act
of Parliament declaring she is dead.

10:22.607 --> 10:24.886
Dead? It is a legal term.

10:24.887 --> 10:28.686
It means you will inherit your half
of your mother's fortune now.

10:28.687 --> 10:31.006
Which goes immediately to him
as your husband.

10:31.007 --> 10:33.246
And Isabel gets her half as well,

10:33.247 --> 10:35.446
so George cannot steal it all.

10:35.447 --> 10:37.686
Whilst I am left in purgatory
or is this hell?

10:37.687 --> 10:40.446
You should be grateful, Countess.

10:40.447 --> 10:42.567
It is here, the Tower or the grave.

10:49.527 --> 10:53.487
Anne, you cannot...
You cannot let him do this.

10:55.167 --> 10:56.487
You must stand with me.

10:57.727 --> 11:02.527
You betrayed me, abandoned me.
Richard saved me.

11:04.287 --> 11:06.487
My love
and trust are utterly with him.

11:09.367 --> 11:10.687
So I have "half"?

11:12.287 --> 11:15.566
I stand there like a beggar with
a bowl as my brothers

11:15.567 --> 11:17.006
put their crumbs in it.

11:17.007 --> 11:20.407
It's always been those two,
since we were children.

11:22.447 --> 11:23.487
Me out on my own...

11:26.567 --> 11:27.727
or with my "mother".

11:32.007 --> 11:35.766
What can I do? How can I help you?

11:35.767 --> 11:37.287
Please, I want to help you.

11:38.967 --> 11:42.286
It's all HER fault, the witch.

11:42.287 --> 11:45.407
She favours Richard and Edward,
simply does what she tells him.

11:49.727 --> 11:55.887
But we are on your side,
little Margaret and I.

11:58.847 --> 12:04.206
But now that Edward has his two sons
and Richard has his boy,

12:04.207 --> 12:05.927
they think that they're untouchable.

12:08.247 --> 12:09.367
How wrong they are.

12:16.727 --> 12:21.367
Because when we take back France,
and when I become Regent...

12:23.767 --> 12:25.807
then Edward will see what
I'm really made of!

12:30.127 --> 12:35.207
So send out commissions and muster
your men. We will take France!

12:37.247 --> 12:38.647
Three sons of York!

12:40.487 --> 12:42.047
And none shall divide us!

12:52.887 --> 12:55.566
Edward, what are you doing?

12:55.567 --> 12:58.127
Stirring up another war where
you could die?

12:59.327 --> 13:02.006
I wish to mark my reign with glory.

13:02.007 --> 13:05.047
Richard could have honour and
George will take the Regency for me.

13:06.567 --> 13:10.086
You cannot give George such power.
He will turn it against you.

13:10.087 --> 13:11.727
He is my brother, Elizabeth.

13:13.207 --> 13:15.846
And fighting for a common
cause will unite us.

13:15.847 --> 13:17.806
It will tear you apart.

13:17.807 --> 13:20.767
If you make George French Regent,
you will regret it.

13:29.167 --> 13:30.606
Is it good news?

13:30.607 --> 13:35.766
What, war? Well, good news
if the King should fall.

13:35.767 --> 13:38.246
But if he doesn't and he becomes
King of France as well,

13:38.247 --> 13:39.806
he'll have so much power,

13:39.807 --> 13:42.087
Brittany won't be in a position
to stand against him.

13:43.287 --> 13:46.967
They would send your son home to
Edward for the slaughter.

13:57.767 --> 13:58.807
Another war.

14:00.447 --> 14:04.086
When Edward promised us
an end to bloodshed

14:04.087 --> 14:05.954
and that our taxes wouldn't rise
again to pay for it...

14:05.954 --> 14:10.326
Oh, blame his brother, George, cos
he surely talked him into it. Well.

14:10.327 --> 14:11.887
They must have their war without me.

14:13.127 --> 14:14.766
I fought enough
when there was reason.

14:14.767 --> 14:18.126
I will not risk my life for this.
No, Anthony!
I'm going on a pilgrimage to Rome.

14:18.127 --> 14:21.150
Edward needs you by his side
in France. I don't trust George...

14:21.150 --> 14:23.167
You will not talk me out of it,
Elizabeth.

14:25.607 --> 14:31.766
Take my advice. You've
made your peace with Lady Margaret.

14:31.767 --> 14:34.086
Do the same with George.

14:34.087 --> 14:39.486
Lady Margaret saved my son and
earned her place as his nursemaid.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.766
George killed our father and brother

14:41.767 --> 14:43.527
and now he's taking
Edward into danger.

14:44.527 --> 14:46.687
I'll make my peace with George
when he's dead.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.406
It frightens me to watch you go.

14:56.407 --> 14:58.207
I couldn't bear to lose you now.

15:00.527 --> 15:02.407
It was my brother George's plan.

15:03.647 --> 15:07.246
I confess, I am troubled
by his sudden call to arms.

15:07.247 --> 15:09.286
What do you mean?

15:09.287 --> 15:13.687
The King has said that George
may govern France...

15:15.647 --> 15:17.847
and I fear that he would
not stop there.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.807
Perhaps he will be calmed now that
Isabel is with child again.

15:26.527 --> 15:28.886
And you are not?

15:28.887 --> 15:33.806
No, but soon. I am sure of it.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.687
We'll have a dozen babies,
as many as the Queen.

15:38.007 --> 15:40.046
I don't mind if we don't,

15:40.047 --> 15:42.807
as long as I have you
and my own honour.

16:13.047 --> 16:14.367
'Dear Jasper and Henry.

16:15.727 --> 16:18.727
'The men have gone to
war in France against King Louis.

16:21.167 --> 16:24.046
'As a dutiful wife, I must pray
for my husband's safe return,

16:24.047 --> 16:27.047
'but I live in fear of a York victory
that would endanger you.

16:29.967 --> 16:33.006
'At court, Elizabeth now rules alone.

16:33.007 --> 16:37.486
'She's like a king herself
and glories in it wickedly.'

16:37.487 --> 16:38.527
Anne!

16:39.967 --> 16:41.487
Oh, it's so good to see you!

16:44.247 --> 16:45.287
Look at you!

16:47.407 --> 16:50.846
'God's path for me is strange indeed
that I am made nursemaid to

16:50.847 --> 16:53.607
'her youngest boy for bringing him
to life with my own hands.

16:55.607 --> 16:58.166
'I cannot bear to tend him

16:58.167 --> 17:01.807
'as he only makes me think of you,
Henry, so long and far away from me.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.047
'Every moment that
I spend here is torture.

17:09.727 --> 17:11.327
'I fear you have forgotten me.

17:13.406 --> 17:17.166
'Please write to me. I miss you.'

17:21.127 --> 17:24.486
How is our mother?
Was she vile to you?

17:24.487 --> 17:26.286
She was angry.

17:26.287 --> 17:28.126
Richard said we had to bring her

17:28.127 --> 17:30.567
because George was going to
steal the money.

17:33.167 --> 17:35.366
He doesn't mean it. He's unhappy,

17:35.367 --> 17:38.406
especially
since Elizabeth had another son

17:38.407 --> 17:41.367
and he is pushed even
further from the throne.

17:42.647 --> 17:46.167
The throne? I thought it was
the Regency of France he wanted.

17:47.407 --> 17:48.967
Yes, that's what I said.

17:51.727 --> 17:56.726
If George has something for himself,
then he'll be so much happier

17:56.727 --> 17:58.087
and everybody wants that.

18:00.367 --> 18:03.567
Our daughter, Margaret,
and I have disappointed him.

18:04.647 --> 18:07.086
He blames me that she's a girl,

18:07.087 --> 18:10.926
but once I have this son for him,
he'll have his heir

18:10.927 --> 18:13.207
and he'll love me.

18:15.127 --> 18:18.167
Is your sister telling you her
news from George in France?

18:20.327 --> 18:21.967
I am worried about Edward.

18:26.487 --> 18:30.846
George writes only that he
wishes our child would be a boy.

18:30.847 --> 18:33.646
We'd have an Edward each, then,
wouldn't we?

18:33.647 --> 18:35.727
My mother bore 14 babies.

18:37.847 --> 18:41.007
So let us hope that we are as
fertile as our mothers...

18:42.127 --> 18:45.007
and that our York brothers will
come home unharmed.

18:49.967 --> 18:52.806
Annie, she just cursed us!

18:52.807 --> 18:54.286
What? Don't be silly, Izzy.

18:54.287 --> 18:58.287
She wished we'd have the same
issue as our mother, two girls!

18:59.607 --> 19:01.327
She just ill-wished our boys!

19:04.847 --> 19:07.326
Could you hear what
they were saying?

19:07.327 --> 19:12.167
She said that George wants
the throne and that you cursed her.

19:22.567 --> 19:26.046
You can't hear witchcraft
in everything she says, Iz.

19:26.047 --> 19:28.126
She is a woman, just as we are.

19:28.127 --> 19:29.247
What if she isn't?

19:30.447 --> 19:33.406
George says that she's a witch.
Father said it, too.

19:33.407 --> 19:35.926
What if everything is her fault?

19:35.927 --> 19:39.686
Ever since she sent that storm that
killed my poor baby boy...

19:39.687 --> 19:41.646
Izzy, please.

19:41.647 --> 19:45.246
We fear her because of what
our father did to hers.

19:45.247 --> 19:46.446
We feel his sin.

19:46.447 --> 19:49.127
The sin is hers. It is all hers!

19:50.887 --> 19:53.406
And now she casts her evil eye on me

19:53.407 --> 19:57.727
and if I can't give George a boy,
it will be all her fault.

20:02.647 --> 20:06.046
We didn't sail here to talk.
We came here to overthrow Louis!

20:06.047 --> 20:08.086
We came to win back England's honour

20:08.087 --> 20:09.886
and reclaim the lands
that should be ours!

20:09.887 --> 20:12.526
All I'm saying is that we should
listen to King Louis's

20:12.527 --> 20:13.806
terms for peace.

20:13.807 --> 20:15.806
He said he would offer land,

20:15.807 --> 20:17.926
so perhaps we could win
without bloodshed.

20:17.927 --> 20:20.566
He cannot offer us dignity or glory!

20:20.567 --> 20:23.566
And he won't make me Regent, Edward,
which is what we agreed.

20:23.567 --> 20:26.006
We agreed on nothing, brother.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.886
I said that I would think about it

20:27.887 --> 20:30.287
and yet you act as
if you're entitled to it!

20:35.287 --> 20:36.327
Argh!

20:42.567 --> 20:46.566
'Dear Anne, our campaign is a farce.

20:46.567 --> 20:49.366
'King Louis has offered Edward
terms of peace

20:49.367 --> 20:51.486
'and he has taken them.

20:51.487 --> 20:53.526
'His son is to marry Edward's
daughter,

20:53.527 --> 20:57.527
'so she will be the next
Queen of France, and lots of gold.

21:00.007 --> 21:02.287
'I cannot forgive him
for this betrayal.

21:05.327 --> 21:06.406
'I have always been

21:06.407 --> 21:09.006
'heart and soul for my brother,
Edward,

21:09.007 --> 21:10.647
'but now I cannot meet his eye.

21:14.007 --> 21:17.487
'We have become like merchants,
haggling a price.

21:23.927 --> 21:27.406
'Worse still, George's ambition is
curdling to rage as this

21:27.407 --> 21:29.127
'peace thwarts him most of all.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.487
'Edward should beware him
from this day.'

21:38.487 --> 21:41.766
Our father would cry for shame
if he could see us now.

21:41.767 --> 21:43.766
It's that whore Elizabeth's fault.

21:43.767 --> 21:47.286
She'd been writing to him since
we left, telling him not to fight.

21:47.287 --> 21:50.167
She has England's high
command, not Edward.

22:15.927 --> 22:18.647
Lady Mother, Father is
back from the war!

22:38.807 --> 22:39.847
Come on.

22:45.367 --> 22:46.407
You're home.

22:48.447 --> 22:51.127
I want you upstairs.
I'm tired of women!

22:52.847 --> 22:55.127
First let me
show you what I brought you.

22:56.447 --> 22:58.687
Stanley! Open a chest.

23:05.127 --> 23:09.246
And for you, my Queen, Malmsey wine.

23:09.247 --> 23:11.126
I told King Louis it
was your favourite.

23:11.127 --> 23:12.167
Richard!

23:20.167 --> 23:23.766
He laughed.
He said I was a fool for chivalry,

23:23.767 --> 23:25.807
then he stuck his own
nose in the trough.

23:29.727 --> 23:30.767
Where's George?

23:32.167 --> 23:33.766
He has gone home already.

23:33.767 --> 23:36.727
He railed against me
for making peace with France.

23:38.007 --> 23:40.607
Richard will come round in time...

23:41.607 --> 23:45.606
but George will barely speak to
me. I think you were right.

23:45.607 --> 23:48.926
He would have come against me
if I had made him Regent.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.846
So now both of them
are angry with us?

23:51.847 --> 23:56.487
I will offer them gold from the
campaign in a hope to appease them.

24:03.047 --> 24:07.487
So my brother shows his true colours.
He is treacherous to the last...

24:08.647 --> 24:11.527
but he shall get what's
coming to him!

24:13.007 --> 24:16.167
But he didn't make you Regent,
so how can you do anything?

24:18.207 --> 24:21.487
I have made a secret deal with
the King of France.

24:22.767 --> 24:25.526
I have promised Louis Calais
back for France if he will

24:25.527 --> 24:29.766
support me with an army to take back
the English throne for myself.

24:29.767 --> 24:34.126
All I need is my new son and heir
and Louis will support me.

24:34.127 --> 24:36.766
And what if it's not a boy?
What if it's a girl?

24:36.767 --> 24:39.326
Or... Or he... dies?

24:39.327 --> 24:41.726
He won't die. Why would he die?

24:41.727 --> 24:45.527
Because she cursed me.
The witch, Elizabeth!

24:46.927 --> 24:49.966
She cursed me that my boys should
die and she's already

24:49.967 --> 24:52.927
killed my first one
and now she'll take this one, too.

24:55.007 --> 24:56.327
She cursed our sons?

24:58.367 --> 24:59.407
She did.

25:01.007 --> 25:03.126
She did.
But George, please don't blame me.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.167
It's not my fault.

25:07.007 --> 25:12.006
She will not take him.
I shall hire a sorcerer

25:12.007 --> 25:16.207
and we shall fight her fire with
fire and break her hold on England.

25:19.447 --> 25:21.767
Richard?

25:23.527 --> 25:24.807
Richard?

25:26.127 --> 25:27.567
How could he do this to me?

25:28.607 --> 25:31.366
Now Edward tries to buy my honour!

25:31.367 --> 25:33.926
He confuses me
with my brother, George.

25:33.927 --> 25:35.926
He does not even know me.

25:35.927 --> 25:37.006
Then send it back

25:37.007 --> 25:38.967
and show him
you do not care for wealth.

25:40.527 --> 25:43.046
The insult has been paid now.

25:43.047 --> 25:46.806
Though everything I thought
I knew has been shaken,

25:46.807 --> 25:52.886
perhaps there's no honour in anyone
and each of us is alone.

25:52.887 --> 25:55.687
But we are not alone
because we have each other.

26:15.647 --> 26:17.486
You asked to see me.

26:17.487 --> 26:20.927
The Act that makes me dead
names you a whore.

26:22.847 --> 26:29.206
No, the law that names me
dead decrees that Richard may

26:29.207 --> 26:30.926
divorce you
and still keep everything,

26:30.927 --> 26:35.086
the land, the castles,
treasure, everything.

26:35.087 --> 26:38.566
You are just a spiteful, old...

26:38.567 --> 26:39.727
Oh yes, well.

26:40.887 --> 26:43.184
Your marriage has been consummated
and you've borne him a son.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.266
What grounds could that
possibly be for divorce?

26:46.967 --> 26:50.047
My guess is you didn't get
dispensation from the Pope.

26:52.247 --> 26:53.287
Am I right?

26:56.407 --> 26:59.006
You're cousins. You would have
needed it but I think Richard

26:59.007 --> 27:01.566
urged you marry straight away
and said he would get it later.

27:01.567 --> 27:03.406
Yes, well, that's because we...

27:03.407 --> 27:05.327
Richard married you for my money.

27:07.727 --> 27:10.887
He will divorce you
and take your money.

27:13.247 --> 27:15.166
So you must leave him.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.846
We will overthrow the Act
and we'll get my fortune back.

27:17.847 --> 27:19.527
We do not need men.

27:22.007 --> 27:24.006
They are all treacherous!

27:24.007 --> 27:29.526
We will manage our affairs
ourselves, you and me, together.

27:29.527 --> 27:32.207
You are mad. You are mad.

27:35.127 --> 27:37.526
You don't believe me.
Ask your husband.

27:37.527 --> 27:38.567
Ask him!

27:39.607 --> 27:42.326
Richard is right to shut you away.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.447
Now stay in here and be dead!

28:07.527 --> 28:08.886
What a surprise.

28:08.887 --> 28:11.566
The Queen has betrothed her
common-born son, Thomas, to

28:11.567 --> 28:13.126
one of the richest girls in England!

28:13.127 --> 28:15.846
She probably used enchantment.
Shut up, George.

28:15.847 --> 28:17.920
The marriage isn't even real.
Whatever comes out of that bed

28:17.920 --> 28:20.046
is only bastards.
Of course it's real!

28:20.047 --> 28:22.726
They are married in the eyes of God
and that's what counts.

28:22.727 --> 28:25.086
It's just I wouldn't want anyone
saying such a terrible

28:25.087 --> 28:26.127
thing of me.

28:27.767 --> 28:31.287
Annie, you mustn't believe what
our mother said.

28:32.807 --> 28:33.927
Richard loves you.

28:36.087 --> 28:39.206
Besides,
you shouldn't be worrying about him.

28:39.207 --> 28:40.866
You should be
worrying about the witch.

28:42.367 --> 28:45.806
One of her ladies told
George that she has two names

28:45.807 --> 28:48.566
written in her locket in blood.

28:48.567 --> 28:50.246
She's cursed them both to die.

28:50.247 --> 28:51.287
What names?

28:52.487 --> 28:55.927
He doesn't know.
What if they're ours?

28:59.167 --> 29:04.206
George says that she'll kill us
all with her cursing, so he has

29:04.207 --> 29:08.446
commissioned special charms to be
made that will protect us.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.446
Er... Lords and Ladies
of the court!

29:11.447 --> 29:13.327
A toast to our newly betrotheds...

29:15.047 --> 29:18.607
and King Edward
and Queen Elizabeth of England!

29:42.647 --> 29:44.607
Edward, you cannot let him
do that to me!

29:45.687 --> 29:47.086
I'll have my mother speak to him.

29:47.087 --> 29:50.486
Your mother? You may as well
reward him with more gold!

29:50.487 --> 29:52.686
Then what do you suggest,
Elizabeth? Truly, tell me

29:52.687 --> 29:56.207
because if you can think of
something that I cannot
then perhaps you should be King!

30:07.847 --> 30:09.286
George!

30:09.287 --> 30:11.567
You will not behave towards me
this way.

30:14.287 --> 30:15.406
Are you threatening me?

30:15.407 --> 30:16.926
I'm the Queen of England.

30:16.927 --> 30:21.166
You're a murderer!
You murdered my first-born son.

30:21.167 --> 30:24.766
You killed my boy with a storm
and I will not let you take my next.

30:24.767 --> 30:26.766
I killed no-one

30:26.767 --> 30:30.407
and I will not let you destroy
the court and all we've worked for.

30:45.407 --> 30:46.447
Shh. Shh.

31:08.807 --> 31:13.726
I found him in our rooms.
She's trying to kill me.

31:13.727 --> 31:16.726
George, how do you know it was her?

31:16.727 --> 31:17.887
Who else could it be?

31:21.967 --> 31:24.787
She is trying to poison us all.

31:26.687 --> 31:29.287
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

31:35.447 --> 31:39.086
Anne,
the Queen has tried to poison us.

31:39.087 --> 31:40.486
We're going back to Tewkesbury.

31:40.487 --> 31:42.406
Isabel, come on. What?

31:42.407 --> 31:45.846
Go to Warwick Castle, Anne,
for me, I beg you.

31:45.847 --> 31:47.927
For God's sake,
get out of this place.

31:49.687 --> 31:51.087
She means to kill us all.

31:52.887 --> 31:56.567
Isabel. Izzy, don't go! Izzy!

32:02.847 --> 32:05.686
How can he know the dog was
poisoned? The thing was old.

32:05.687 --> 32:07.806
It could've died from anything.

32:07.807 --> 32:11.127
Isabel said SHE poisoned it,
the witch.

32:42.407 --> 32:43.927
You should be resting, Isabel.

32:45.607 --> 32:47.646
'My dearest Annie.

32:47.647 --> 32:53.206
'I've had my baby boy, Teddy.
He's a cheruby little thing

32:53.207 --> 32:56.766
'but Annie, George says the witch
will try and poison him

32:56.767 --> 33:01.407
'while he's small and weak
so he's paying a sorcerer...

33:02.647 --> 33:07.686
'..a man named Burdett to
ward off evil spells. Annie,

33:07.687 --> 33:10.127
'I'm ill. I'm bedridden.

33:11.647 --> 33:14.286
'George says
the Queen has poisoned me.

33:14.287 --> 33:17.006
'Either that or it's her curse on me.

33:17.007 --> 33:20.647
'I'm frightened, Annie. I need you.

33:21.647 --> 33:22.687
'Burn this.'

33:40.327 --> 33:41.367
You're too late.

33:42.607 --> 33:43.887
What do you mean?

33:50.807 --> 33:52.447
No, Izzy!

33:53.927 --> 33:57.287
No, no, no. No!

33:59.207 --> 34:00.247
No.

34:07.127 --> 34:08.167
Help.

34:16.487 --> 34:17.847
No.

34:21.647 --> 34:24.525
Shouldn't we tell people,
so that they can say goodbye?

34:24.527 --> 34:25.847
Who can we trust, though?

34:29.246 --> 34:33.246
If this was the Queen's doing, then
I shall have revenge on her.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.687
I'll talk to the King.
I'll tell him what I know.

34:38.967 --> 34:40.677
But I know what he'll try to do.

34:40.677 --> 34:42.326
He'll try to buy me
off with marriage and get me

34:42.327 --> 34:43.447
out of the country.

34:44.887 --> 34:46.567
But I won't agree to it.

34:51.647 --> 34:52.687
Of course I won't.

35:00.487 --> 35:03.367
I think I grew to love her, Anne.

35:05.447 --> 35:06.607
I really think I did.

35:17.607 --> 35:19.727
Anne...

35:23.447 --> 35:24.487
is it true?

35:28.447 --> 35:29.607
Your sister is dead?

35:30.767 --> 35:33.807
Yes. I'm sorry.

35:39.727 --> 35:41.247
I'm sorry I left you...

35:44.287 --> 35:45.607
on the battlefield.

35:48.567 --> 35:49.607
I was afraid.

35:56.807 --> 35:59.527
Damn you, Edward. George!
Damn you and damn her!

36:28.367 --> 36:29.766
Edward!

36:29.767 --> 36:31.566
Leave us.

36:31.567 --> 36:33.886
George has just accused me
publicly of witchcraft!

36:33.887 --> 36:36.046
He is spreading rumours
that his wife was poisoned

36:36.047 --> 36:37.206
and I was the one who did it.

36:37.207 --> 36:40.806
George is angry because
he cannot have the wife he wants.

36:40.807 --> 36:46.086
He just asked me
for Mary of Burgundy but I said no.

36:46.087 --> 36:48.646
Imagine what would happen
if we let him loose with Flanders!

36:48.647 --> 36:51.645
He is accusing me of murder, Edward!

36:51.645 --> 36:53.634
And if you're not going to do
anything about it, then

36:53.634 --> 36:56.167
I most certainly will.
Yes, and what will you do?

36:57.487 --> 37:00.327
Hmm?
They already say you're a witch.

37:01.367 --> 37:04.126
Now, unless you want those rumours
to grow, then you must learn to

37:04.127 --> 37:07.927
rise above the accusations,
for once, and do nothing.

37:15.647 --> 37:18.527
I will command Anne Neville to
an audience with me...

37:20.487 --> 37:22.207
and I will scotch the rumours.

37:39.047 --> 37:42.647
Lady Anne, do you believe
your sister, Isabel, was poisoned?

37:43.647 --> 37:45.367
She said the dog was poisoned.

37:46.487 --> 37:48.647
Izzy thought
she wasn't safe at court.

37:50.247 --> 37:53.326
She feared the Queen
would poison her? I...

37:53.327 --> 37:57.206
Well, if anyone were to poison her,
it would be George himself.

37:57.207 --> 37:58.526
She's barely cold in her grave

37:58.527 --> 38:01.806
and all he cares about is snaring
himself a powerful new wife.

38:01.807 --> 38:04.007
It is the King who wants him
to re-marry.

38:05.927 --> 38:07.606
The King?

38:07.607 --> 38:10.006
And why would the King want
George in Flanders

38:10.007 --> 38:12.367
when all he'd do is bring
an army to attack us?

38:13.487 --> 38:16.231
Use your head and think, for once,
you stupid girl,

38:16.231 --> 38:17.917
instead of listening to his venom.

38:18.647 --> 38:21.787
I didn't poison anyone.

38:25.927 --> 38:26.967
So it's true, then?

38:28.247 --> 38:31.447
That George wants to re-marry? Yes.

38:34.087 --> 38:36.847
You don't think it could be
him that killed my sister, do you?

38:38.567 --> 38:40.767
We do not even know
if she was murdered...

38:41.887 --> 38:44.007
apart from George's
accusation of it.

38:45.087 --> 38:47.407
She could have
died from child bed fever.

38:49.087 --> 38:53.927
They were married before God,
so he could not put her aside.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.487
But now he has her
half of the fortune.

39:01.887 --> 39:03.367
He is still not happy.

39:09.887 --> 39:12.766
I want to go and fetch my niece
and nephew.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.687
I want them here with me
at Warwick Castle, away from danger.

39:26.807 --> 39:28.726
Happy times for you, then.

39:28.727 --> 39:31.006
You think I'd celebrate a young
girl's death?

39:31.007 --> 39:33.326
Well, it's had the effect
you've been hoping for.

39:33.327 --> 39:35.126
The whole court is dividing.

39:35.127 --> 39:38.167
And you and your brother will be
on both sides, as ever.

39:40.207 --> 39:41.590
So who do you think the murderer is,
Margaret?

39:41.590 --> 39:46.006
I don't know. Most likely
that unholy sorcerer of George's.

39:46.007 --> 39:49.926
Some concoction designed to protect
her probably ended her.

39:49.927 --> 39:51.287
So George has a sorcerer?

39:52.447 --> 39:54.086
How do you know?

39:54.087 --> 39:56.126
The Queen requests
I listen to court gossip.

39:56.127 --> 39:58.566
I do not tell her everything I hear.

39:58.567 --> 40:01.167
Yeah, but if there's one thing
we should tell them, it's that.

40:03.807 --> 40:05.726
I don't know if it's true for sure.

40:05.727 --> 40:09.086
Take men to Tewkesbury. Arrest
George. There'll be no warning.

40:09.087 --> 40:10.127
Do it now!

40:19.527 --> 40:22.890
Now George has found himself
a sorcerer to counteract

40:22.890 --> 40:24.327
your "witchcraft".

40:34.807 --> 40:36.046
Where's George?

40:36.047 --> 40:38.684
He escaped. We will capture him.

40:44.247 --> 40:45.287
No!

41:25.207 --> 41:27.087
What are you doing out here alone?

41:31.607 --> 41:35.366
Wishing that this river was
a moat to keep my loved ones safe

41:35.367 --> 41:37.927
and enemies out.
When did you get back? Just now.

41:39.207 --> 41:40.326
Have you heard?

41:40.327 --> 41:42.006
George employed
a sorcerer against me

41:42.007 --> 41:45.926
and half the court thinks
he has just cause.

41:45.927 --> 41:48.166
I don't know what to do.

41:48.167 --> 41:49.247
Trust God.

41:50.367 --> 41:52.886
Pray for his guidance.

41:52.887 --> 41:54.046
George is on the run.

41:54.047 --> 41:56.766
We don't know where he'll go
or what he'll do.

41:56.767 --> 41:58.766
And now we must dance and carouse

41:58.767 --> 42:02.126
and celebrate Edward's
15 years as King.

42:02.127 --> 42:03.927
I don't feel like celebrating.

42:19.127 --> 42:24.446
Smile and behold our most glorious
sight! Follow the creatures!

42:24.447 --> 42:29.726
Follow the light! Come now
and honour the years of your King!

42:29.727 --> 42:33.767
Come and exalt him!
Come now and sing!

42:51.607 --> 42:54.006
Richard, all the men are armed.

42:54.007 --> 42:57.206
Everyone is siding for or
against the Queen.

42:57.207 --> 43:01.006
Edward fears she will be
assassinated, given all the rumours.

43:01.007 --> 43:03.487
But Richard... Wait, Richard!

43:05.087 --> 43:06.127
Lead on.

43:07.207 --> 43:09.406
We have examined
the sorcerer's charts

43:09.407 --> 43:12.246
and it's even worse than I thought.

43:12.247 --> 43:14.447
George has been
foretelling my death.

43:17.567 --> 43:19.486
What will you do?

43:19.487 --> 43:22.007
What can I do? He is my brother.

43:24.927 --> 43:27.847
Look at her,
acting like the King herself.

43:33.647 --> 43:35.406
George, you shouldn't be here.

43:35.407 --> 43:37.286
I'm not afraid of either of them.

43:37.287 --> 43:39.926
My sorcerer has told me that the
witch will give the Princes

43:39.927 --> 43:44.046
over to their killer with her own
hand. She will end her line herself.

43:44.047 --> 43:46.366
George, please be quiet!

43:46.367 --> 43:49.246
It is forbidden to predict
the death of royalty.

43:49.247 --> 43:53.886
And to kill a royal Duchess,
to murder your sister.

43:53.887 --> 43:55.407
They didn't let that stop them.

43:56.927 --> 43:59.286
The swine is here! I can hear him.

43:59.287 --> 44:04.606
My friend, Thomas Burdett, refused
the quicker death that he was

44:04.607 --> 44:09.086
entitled
if he had confessed to his guilt.

44:09.087 --> 44:10.126
George?

44:10.127 --> 44:11.926
Now what does this tell you
about that man?

44:11.927 --> 44:15.127
George! George!

44:20.007 --> 44:21.047
Argh!

44:25.807 --> 44:26.846
George, you coward!

44:26.847 --> 44:30.926
If he had confessed, his heirs could
have inherited, but he refused...

44:30.927 --> 44:32.126
Where is he?

44:32.127 --> 44:36.126
Because this man... George!
..this man was innocent!

44:36.127 --> 44:43.407
So your King, your great King,
your beloved Edward, is a murderer!

44:44.807 --> 44:47.686
Just as you have murdered before,
eh, Edward?

44:47.687 --> 44:52.206
When you took a pillow and you
smothered old King Henry.

44:52.207 --> 44:57.926
And who bade you do it?
That evil witch, Elizabeth Rivers!

44:57.927 --> 45:02.526
And you killed my wife
and you killed my first-born son!

45:02.527 --> 45:06.206
Somebody take him. He's gone mad!
And you still don't see it!

45:06.207 --> 45:08.846
Anthony, Richard, seize him!

45:08.847 --> 45:12.406
She's dragging this country
to hell... George, stop it!

45:12.407 --> 45:16.046
And she's taking us all with her!
George, stop it!

45:16.047 --> 45:17.087
Be quiet, George!

45:42.427 --> 45:46.706
We are here to try George,
Duke of Clarence,

45:46.707 --> 45:48.107
who's charged with treason.

45:54.547 --> 45:57.067
And I shall act as Prosecutor.

46:19.387 --> 46:20.626
Is there any news?

46:20.627 --> 46:23.106
They're still giving evidence.

46:23.107 --> 46:26.026
But everyone now seems certain that
Isabel died of child bed fever,

46:26.027 --> 46:27.266
not of poison.

46:27.267 --> 46:30.466
All the focus has shifted onto
George using a sorcerer.

46:30.467 --> 46:33.586
The King is prosecuting.
No-one is defending.

46:33.587 --> 46:34.627
Not even Richard.

46:36.987 --> 46:42.186
Elizabeth, I would like to
leave the court

46:42.187 --> 46:44.187
and go back to my husband
in the country.

46:50.467 --> 46:54.866
He cannot do it. Richard,
you must tell him!

46:54.867 --> 46:56.747
If he's found guilty, he will die.

46:58.107 --> 47:00.506
The Queen would have him dead.

47:00.507 --> 47:03.107
She's not forgiven him
for her father and her brother.

47:04.707 --> 47:07.426
We are the three sons of York.

47:07.427 --> 47:10.066
How can we be divided by one woman?

47:10.067 --> 47:14.147
Oh, please, not George!
Not George of all of you.

47:18.587 --> 47:23.927
Why him of all of us?
Would you rather it was me?

47:24.587 --> 47:27.586
Would you rather it was Edward who
died and his sons, too,

47:27.587 --> 47:30.306
just so your precious little George
could have every last thing

47:30.307 --> 47:31.347
he ever wanted?

48:07.667 --> 48:10.867
They found him guilty.
You must have heard.

48:12.907 --> 48:16.066
Is that not what you would want?

48:16.067 --> 48:18.147
I don't even know
the answer to that.

48:22.507 --> 48:29.026
Tell me, how shall we find
the strength to bear the wrongs

48:29.027 --> 48:30.227
people do us?

48:32.027 --> 48:34.106
He killed my father and my brother.

48:34.107 --> 48:36.226
He murdered them in cold blood.

48:36.227 --> 48:38.567
So why should he fare any better?

48:40.267 --> 48:42.307
Have you known loss, Lady Margaret?

48:43.827 --> 48:45.347
I've buried two husbands...

48:46.867 --> 48:49.427
and my only son is forced to
live away from me.

48:50.707 --> 48:55.186
He is heir to the House of
Lancaster, an enemy to the King, so.

48:55.187 --> 48:57.547
I do not see him,
was not allowed to raise him.

48:58.707 --> 49:00.827
He may as well be lost to me.

49:01.707 --> 49:02.986
And yet you have your faith?

49:02.987 --> 49:05.027
The Bible tells us
"an eye for an eye".

49:08.507 --> 49:12.626
But it also tells us,
"Love your enemies,

49:12.627 --> 49:16.467
"bless those who curse you and pray
for those who spitefully use you."

49:18.267 --> 49:19.307
Lady Margaret?

49:20.787 --> 49:22.427
Will you pray with me?

49:52.987 --> 49:55.227
I would like us
to make peace with George.

49:57.147 --> 50:01.000
If he apologises and withdraws
his accusations, then I think

50:01.000 --> 50:01.987
we should forgive him.

50:04.507 --> 50:09.791
He has been plotting with
King Louis of France to murder me

50:09.791 --> 50:11.277
and take my throne.

50:17.027 --> 50:18.947
I have to pass the death sentence.

50:24.587 --> 50:27.323
You cannot execute him.
He's your brother.

50:27.323 --> 50:30.026
You've said yourself that he's not.
He planned to kill me.

50:30.027 --> 50:32.107
Of course he didn't! There's proof.

50:33.387 --> 50:37.069
George has been disappointed.
You know, it's been so hard for him.

50:37.069 --> 50:39.106
You will forgive him,
Edward, you will!

50:39.107 --> 50:42.327
I'm sorry for your loss, Mother,
but I will not.

50:44.867 --> 50:48.386
You will forgive him. I command it.

50:48.387 --> 50:49.997
You do not command me.

50:50.707 --> 50:53.991
I am your MOTHER!

50:53.991 --> 50:55.255
Yes, and I am the KING!

50:55.255 --> 50:56.067
You will!

51:00.707 --> 51:04.026
Oh, God! Oh, God!

51:04.027 --> 51:06.746
All I can offer is to let him
choose the means of his own death,

51:06.747 --> 51:09.146
whether it be the sword or
the scaffold or the block or

51:09.147 --> 51:12.506
whatever he chooses. This is YOUR
work! No, it's not. But he will die.

51:12.507 --> 51:19.367
Please, Edward! Please.
You're my son.

51:21.787 --> 51:26.626
You can't do this to me.
You can't kill him.

51:26.627 --> 51:30.466
Please, Edward! I beg you.
I beg you.

51:30.467 --> 51:31.507
I beg you!

51:35.947 --> 51:37.387
I will beg you!

51:41.427 --> 51:42.387
I beg you!

51:45.347 --> 51:47.386
Please.

51:47.387 --> 51:53.026
Please, Edward. Please! Please!
Edward! Edward, please! He's my boy!

51:53.027 --> 51:55.306
He's my precious boy!

51:55.307 --> 51:59.027
Please. He's my... Please! Please!

52:01.627 --> 52:03.667
Edward!

52:10.307 --> 52:12.706
He wants to be
drowned in a barrel of wine.

52:12.707 --> 52:13.906
Oh, don't joke, Anthony.

52:13.907 --> 52:16.967
George, the fool,
has chosen a fool's death...

52:17.507 --> 52:19.786
a barrel of Malmsey wine.

52:19.787 --> 52:24.767
He's no fool. It's to punish me.

52:26.747 --> 52:34.067
Dextera tua erigas, virtute
confirmes, potestate tuearis.

52:35.507 --> 52:39.267
My sweet boy, George.
My poor, sweet boy.

52:41.107 --> 52:43.506
Their children will be orphans.

52:43.507 --> 52:48.547
Orphans and paupers!
Their father dies a traitor.

52:49.147 --> 52:50.667
His lands will be forfeit.

52:51.747 --> 52:53.667
And who do you think will get them?

52:55.387 --> 52:57.106
SHE will.

52:57.107 --> 53:01.906
Talking to you. This is our own
brother that we're talking about!

53:01.907 --> 53:04.386
Do you realise how ridiculous
you are being here?

53:04.387 --> 53:05.786
He's gone too far. I can see that.

53:05.787 --> 53:09.266
He has committed high treason!

53:09.267 --> 53:15.106
Cum omni desiderata prosperitate,
restituas.

53:15.107 --> 53:17.307
Per Christum Dominum nostrum.

53:24.347 --> 53:26.706
Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.

53:26.707 --> 53:30.866
Is no-one coming to see me?
My mother,

53:30.867 --> 53:32.626
or at least my brothers?

53:32.627 --> 53:36.907
Wait! Wait, please! At least let me
see my brother, the King.

53:37.787 --> 53:38.827
No! Aargh!

54:14.667 --> 54:15.707
Agnus Dei...

54:19.827 --> 54:20.867
Agnus Dei...

54:31.027 --> 54:32.067
Oh, please!

55:11.267 --> 55:12.867
Let's go home to Warwick Castle.

55:17.747 --> 55:19.507
Richard.

55:21.387 --> 55:22.967
Do you love me?

55:25.147 --> 55:26.187
Truly?

55:28.707 --> 55:33.287
Anne! Oh, God, Anne!

55:57.747 --> 56:01.842
Stanley has asked if Lady Margaret's
son may have his title

56:01.842 --> 56:04.447
returned to him, now that
George is...

56:06.107 --> 56:09.707
Why not?
It's one less person who'll hate us.

56:14.547 --> 56:20.587
This will be the last death, Edward.
You must think of life.

56:21.827 --> 56:23.147
Think of our children.

56:29.267 --> 56:30.307
I have good news.

56:31.747 --> 56:34.186
The King has agreed that Henry
may be given back his title,

56:34.187 --> 56:35.307
Earl of Richmond.

56:37.067 --> 56:38.426
He's agreed?

56:38.427 --> 56:41.386
Seeing as its previous owner
is deceased.

56:41.387 --> 56:44.586
Perhaps he's feeling
short of friends.

56:44.587 --> 56:47.546
Will they let him come home?
They have not ruled it out

56:47.547 --> 56:49.106
but you are at the Queen's bosom now,

56:49.107 --> 56:51.307
so perhaps you can help
influence her.

56:54.467 --> 56:58.346
Do...
Do they still fear he's a rival?

56:58.347 --> 57:01.466
Well, of course he's a rival.

57:01.467 --> 57:03.626
But who would follow
a stranger over Edward,

57:03.627 --> 57:06.186
especially when he has his two
beloved Princes to follow him

57:06.187 --> 57:10.947
to the throne and then his brother,
Richard, and his son, Edward, too?

57:12.987 --> 57:16.260
Your Henry is going to have to walk
past five coffins to take

57:16.260 --> 57:19.227
the crown, and I don't know
how he's going to manage that.

57:20.787 --> 57:21.827
Do you?

57:50.187 --> 57:54.187
