01:29.768 --> 01:32.862
Jeepers. That was seriously scary.

01:33.038 --> 01:34.630
Come on, let's go again.

01:35.273 --> 01:38.299
Uh... Let's not
and say we didn't.

01:38.710 --> 01:39.734
I'm with Daphne.

01:39.911 --> 01:44.314
The Ghost Coaster is by far the scariest ride
at the Halloween Carnival.

01:47.019 --> 01:51.615
Are you kidding?
Like, that ride put the "easy" in "cheesy."

01:51.790 --> 01:55.419
Yeah. Easy.

01:56.495 --> 01:59.555
Are you sure
you weren't just a little bit scared?

01:59.731 --> 02:05.192
- By all the bloodsucking vampires?
- Howling werewolves?

02:05.370 --> 02:07.235
And wicked witches.

02:10.375 --> 02:12.639
Nice try, gang,
but Scoob and I aren't scared...

02:12.811 --> 02:14.779
...of any of those phony old frights.

02:15.247 --> 02:18.614
Yeah, phony frights.

02:19.217 --> 02:23.119
- Come on.
- Not even on Halloween night?

02:23.288 --> 02:24.755
Ha. Are you kidding?

02:24.923 --> 02:28.484
Like, Halloween is the one night
when you know everything is fake.

02:28.660 --> 02:29.888
Just take a look around.

02:30.062 --> 02:33.054
It's nothing but wannabe witches
and goofball ghosts...

02:33.231 --> 02:35.927
...as far as the eye can see.

02:45.444 --> 02:47.241
Yum, yum.

02:49.081 --> 02:54.781
But I got to admit, a holiday invented
just to eat candy can't be all bad.

02:58.457 --> 03:00.186
Hey, check it out.

03:05.464 --> 03:08.729
- This ought to be good.
- I'll grab tickets before they sell out.

03:16.141 --> 03:21.511
- Like, beat that, Scoob.
- Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

03:24.516 --> 03:26.006
- Scooby.
- Scooby.

03:32.524 --> 03:35.391
Confounded mutt.

03:35.560 --> 03:39.018
Look what you've done. I'm soaked.

03:41.900 --> 03:45.233
Ugh! Wet-dog smell.

03:45.804 --> 03:49.501
Oh, wow. We know you.
You're the Amazing Krudsky.

03:49.941 --> 03:52.171
We were just on our way
to catch your act.

03:52.744 --> 03:59.149
Act? The Halloween Spectacular
is no mere act.

03:59.317 --> 04:04.277
Now, out of the way.
I must go blow-dry my cummerbund.

04:04.456 --> 04:07.857
So I guess we'll be seeing you inside.

04:08.894 --> 04:10.691
Three magic words:

04:11.129 --> 04:15.259
"No dogs allowed."

04:20.038 --> 04:22.370
Can you believe the nerve of this guy?

04:22.541 --> 04:27.808
"Master of magic." Please.
Like, what a bunch of Halloween hooey.

04:28.346 --> 04:30.541
Yeah, hooey.

04:30.982 --> 04:33.416
Hey, that gives me an idea.

04:33.585 --> 04:36.418
Like, what do you say
we get in on the act?

04:38.623 --> 04:40.250
Yeah?

04:44.529 --> 04:47.123
<i>Once a year, on Halloween night...</i>

04:47.299 --> 04:52.362
<i>... the powers of the dark</i>
<i>meet the powers of the light.</i>

04:56.708 --> 04:58.335
People of Coolsville...

04:58.510 --> 05:04.346
...fix your slack-jawed gaze
upon my dazzling powers.

05:13.592 --> 05:20.088
From the elegant parlors of Vienna
to this unglamorous backwater...

05:20.265 --> 05:23.826
...I, the Amazing Krudsky...

05:24.002 --> 05:26.562
...have come to astound you.

05:26.738 --> 05:29.673
Abra-cam, kalabazam!

05:30.008 --> 05:31.373
Ta-da!

05:31.543 --> 05:34.103
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

05:40.585 --> 05:45.147
Like, check it out. That's not magic.
This table has a hole in it.

05:45.323 --> 05:46.813
Ooh!

05:46.992 --> 05:49.586
Confound it. You're ruining my...

05:51.796 --> 05:53.457
And would you look at that?

05:53.632 --> 05:56.328
Like, a trapdoor
built right into the floorboards.

05:56.501 --> 06:00.335
That must be
how he magically appeared on-stage.

06:00.505 --> 06:02.803
Ooh. Uh-huh, uh-huh.

06:03.842 --> 06:05.742
There's no mystery here, Scoob.

06:05.911 --> 06:10.610
Like, the Amazing Krudsky
is just a make-believe magician.

06:13.151 --> 06:15.984
No. Please.

06:16.154 --> 06:19.453
Come back. I can explain.

06:25.563 --> 06:28.589
I'll get you for this.

06:29.334 --> 06:32.098
And your big dog too.

06:33.672 --> 06:36.539
Way to go, you two.
You got us kicked out of the carnival.

06:37.108 --> 06:38.905
Now what are we supposed to do?

06:45.650 --> 06:46.981
Don't sweat it, gang.

06:47.152 --> 06:50.383
There's still one Halloween hoax
we do believe in.

06:53.158 --> 06:55.183
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

06:56.795 --> 06:58.626
Smell my feet.

07:00.065 --> 07:02.966
And give us something groovy to eat.

07:11.176 --> 07:12.200
Hey, Scoob.

07:13.111 --> 07:17.377
Like, check it out.
The world's first candy hot tub.

07:17.549 --> 07:19.608
Yeah.

07:20.251 --> 07:23.482
Okay, I think that's enough
trick-or-treating for one night.

07:23.922 --> 07:26.049
It's getting late.

07:26.591 --> 07:29.219
One more? Please?

07:29.694 --> 07:33.824
Okay, you guys go ahead.
We'll grab the van and meet you back here.

07:33.999 --> 07:36.900
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

07:54.886 --> 07:57.354
Blast those teenage troublemakers.

08:00.525 --> 08:03.358
If word of this gets out, I'll be ruined.

08:05.530 --> 08:08.897
It's not my fault I'm a big phony.

08:09.067 --> 08:12.036
I've spent a lifetime
in search of real magic.

08:13.405 --> 08:17.205
I've studied every spell,
spoken every incantation.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.900
There must be something I'm missing.

08:22.914 --> 08:24.609
Huh?

08:28.520 --> 08:33.787
The Goblin Scepter:
Fabled wand of the great Goblin King.

08:33.957 --> 08:36.017
"Bewitched by the darkest magic...

08:36.193 --> 08:42.758
...he who holds the Goblin Scepter
holds the magic of Halloween in his grasp."

08:43.333 --> 08:44.926
It must be a sign.

08:45.103 --> 08:51.508
Somehow, someway,
tonight the Goblin Scepter will be mine.

08:54.312 --> 08:59.181
Prepare yourself, Krudsky.
You're finally going up in the world.

09:03.088 --> 09:04.885
Whoa, whoa!

09:14.866 --> 09:18.859
Who is responsible for this indignity?

09:21.439 --> 09:25.842
Think this is funny, do you?
Show yourself this instant.

09:33.618 --> 09:35.609
Pesky insect.

10:19.230 --> 10:21.357
Gotcha.

10:28.072 --> 10:30.973
F... F... Fairy?

10:37.649 --> 10:39.446
Yes. "Fairy."

10:39.617 --> 10:42.780
"If a mortal catches a fairy
on Halloween...

10:42.954 --> 10:46.947
...the fairy's magic can be stolen
using the following spell."

10:49.961 --> 10:53.397
<i>By the fearful powers of Halloween night</i>

10:53.565 --> 10:57.126
<i>Give to me this fairy's light</i>

11:10.348 --> 11:13.408
Here we are, Scoob.
Last house on the block.

11:16.921 --> 11:21.017
Boy, you said it. Talk about a kooky crib.

11:27.465 --> 11:29.933
There's nothing to be afraid of, Scoob.

11:30.101 --> 11:33.537
It's just more Halloween hogwash.

11:42.413 --> 11:48.818
- But, like, shouldn't we have knocked first?
- Yeah, we should've knocked.

11:52.123 --> 11:56.253
Like, check out
this creepshow convenience store.

11:57.295 --> 11:59.195
Hey, Scoob.

11:59.831 --> 12:03.426
Like, just call me
Merlin the mostest magician.

12:23.688 --> 12:28.523
- What is it, Scooby-Doo?
- Magic mirror. Magic mirror.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.823
A magic mirror? Come off it, Scoob.

12:33.531 --> 12:36.796
What are you,
afraid of your own shadow?

12:42.407 --> 12:46.901
Who dares speak of the shadows
on Halloween night?

12:48.980 --> 12:50.607
- Huh?
- Huh?

12:51.449 --> 12:55.215
A wizard must be careful with his words.

12:55.820 --> 12:56.878
Our bad.

12:57.055 --> 13:00.991
- Like, we're new here.
- Yeah, new here.

13:02.427 --> 13:05.988
Always delighted to meet new customers.
Always, always.

13:06.431 --> 13:07.625
Welcome to Mr. Gibbles'...

13:07.799 --> 13:12.395
...where the magic is real
at prices that are unreal.

13:12.837 --> 13:14.896
Sorry, but you got us all wrong.

13:15.073 --> 13:18.167
Like, we're not customers,
we're consumers.

13:18.343 --> 13:22.006
- Like, trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

13:22.447 --> 13:24.506
Trick or treat, eh?

13:24.682 --> 13:29.176
Well, then, I choose "trick."

13:32.790 --> 13:36.226
<i>Witches and warlocks</i>
<i>Ghosts and ghouls</i>

13:36.394 --> 13:39.386
<i>One night a year</i>
<i>They break all the rules</i>

13:39.564 --> 13:42.931
<i>You never know who's at the door</i>
<i>On Halloween night</i>

13:43.101 --> 13:46.127
<i>Spirits from the shadows</i>
<i>Creeping into the light</i>

13:46.571 --> 13:51.599
<i>Werewolves howl</i>
<i>And vampires take a bite</i>

13:52.110 --> 13:53.304
That's scary.

13:53.478 --> 13:56.709
<i>Don't you know there's still hope?</i>
<i>Take it from me</i>

13:56.881 --> 13:59.975
<i>You can have protection</i>
<i>For a nominal fee</i>

14:00.151 --> 14:04.485
<i>Tonight the dark and light unite</i>
<i>A magical mystery</i>

14:05.323 --> 14:08.656
<i>Spell books, potions</i>
<i>They fly off the shelves</i>

14:08.826 --> 14:11.989
<i>We offer a discount</i>
<i>To trolls and elves</i>

14:12.163 --> 14:15.564
<i>When danger's at the door</i>
<i>On Halloween night</i>

14:15.733 --> 14:19.260
<i>If you master magic</i>
<i>You can put up a fight</i>

14:19.437 --> 14:20.904
<i>Face your fears</i>
<i>The power's here</i>

14:21.072 --> 14:24.667
<i>At Gibbles' the price is right</i>

14:27.478 --> 14:31.437
Mr. Gibbles. Mr. Gibbles, please.
Please open up. I need your help.

14:31.883 --> 14:35.114
Galloping ghosts. Fairy Princess Willow.

14:37.255 --> 14:39.621
- Fairy Princess?
- Fairy Princess?

14:40.191 --> 14:42.455
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

14:42.627 --> 14:44.492
Please listen. There isn't much time.

14:44.662 --> 14:47.028
An evil magician
has stolen my fairy powers.

14:47.465 --> 14:50.161
You must close the shop
before he finds me here.

14:50.968 --> 14:54.199
Close my magic shop?
On Halloween night?

14:54.372 --> 14:57.341
Oh, another one of your pixy pranks.

14:57.809 --> 15:00.004
This is no prank.

15:01.646 --> 15:04.706
Please, you must hurry
before it's too late.

15:05.249 --> 15:08.241
Speaking of "late,"
like, don't bother showing us the door.

15:08.419 --> 15:12.446
If there's one thing we know,
it's how to make an exit.

15:20.298 --> 15:24.291
Mr. Gibbles' Genuine Magic Shoppe.

15:24.469 --> 15:27.461
My, what an impressive emporium.

15:27.638 --> 15:31.074
Mind if I have a quick look around?

15:32.877 --> 15:35.107
I'm sorry,
we were just closing for the night.

15:35.279 --> 15:37.747
Perhaps you can come back next year?

15:37.915 --> 15:40.315
I've waited long enough.

15:40.485 --> 15:43.113
<i>Mirror, mirror, tall and sleek</i>

15:43.287 --> 15:47.485
<i>Show me the fairy that I seek</i>

15:56.267 --> 15:57.529
Ah.

15:57.702 --> 15:59.863
There you are.

16:04.108 --> 16:05.200
Fickle fairy.

16:05.376 --> 16:08.174
Thought you could escape
while my back was turned?

16:09.113 --> 16:12.879
Typical mortal.
Stealing my fairy magic isn't enough?

16:13.050 --> 16:17.009
Once you have a little power,
all you want is more, more, more.

16:17.822 --> 16:21.121
I know. Isn't it marvelous?

16:21.292 --> 16:24.591
Now, obey your master.

16:24.762 --> 16:27.890
Dominatum triumphus!

16:34.939 --> 16:38.773
No. Anti-villainous desistus!

16:40.545 --> 16:42.035
Old fool.

16:42.213 --> 16:44.704
<i>Ears of fuzz, tail of cotton</i>

16:44.882 --> 16:48.147
<i>Powers of good</i>
<i>Meet the powers of rotten</i>

16:53.691 --> 16:55.750
Now, hop along.

16:55.927 --> 16:59.988
I'll just pick up a few things
while I'm here.

17:11.876 --> 17:13.810
Zoinks. Don't look now, Scoob...

17:13.978 --> 17:17.914
...but I think the Not-So-Amazing Krudsky
just got his act together.

17:18.950 --> 17:19.973
Don't worry, lads.

17:20.151 --> 17:23.643
We may yet save the Fairy Princess
and Halloween.

17:23.820 --> 17:27.723
I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve.

17:29.727 --> 17:31.422
Like, that's not his sleeve.

17:31.996 --> 17:33.725
Uh-uh.

17:38.402 --> 17:41.337
Like, we'd love to stick around,
but I just remembered...

17:41.505 --> 17:44.906
...Scoob and I are deathly allergic
to magical talking rabbits.

17:45.076 --> 17:46.566
Uh-huh.

17:55.386 --> 17:57.581
<i>Crystal burning bright with fire</i>

17:57.755 --> 18:00.986
<i>Future secrets I desire</i>

18:01.158 --> 18:03.888
<i>Oh, Scooby-Doo, where are you?</i>

18:04.362 --> 18:05.590
- Huh?
- Huh?

18:08.265 --> 18:14.204
This shall teach you
to meddle in the affairs of magicians.

18:38.095 --> 18:40.825
- Oh, no.
- Zoinks!

18:42.033 --> 18:43.523
Like, that magical maniac...

18:43.701 --> 18:46.864
...just gave the gang
an extreme monster makeover.

18:47.038 --> 18:51.202
No, my friends.
It is the future you have seen.

18:51.742 --> 18:53.505
What?

18:53.978 --> 18:55.104
Like, the future?

18:55.546 --> 18:58.811
As in, stuff that hasn't happened yet
and therefore might be changed...

18:58.983 --> 19:02.146
...if we embark on a perilous quest
to alter the hand of destiny?

19:02.319 --> 19:04.287
Like, that kind of future?

19:04.722 --> 19:07.122
Something like that, yes.

19:08.225 --> 19:12.787
- Like, I was afraid of that.
- Yeah. Me too.

19:12.963 --> 19:14.794
We must act quickly.

19:18.135 --> 19:20.103
See for yourselves.

19:21.005 --> 19:24.406
The magic scepter
of the great Goblin King himself.

19:25.409 --> 19:28.207
- Great Goblin King?
- Great Goblin King?

19:28.379 --> 19:29.403
Don't you see?

19:29.580 --> 19:32.913
Krudsky has stolen the light magic
from Princess Willow.

19:33.084 --> 19:36.383
Now he only needs the dark magic
of the Goblin Scepter...

19:36.554 --> 19:39.079
...to complete his power.

19:39.824 --> 19:43.282
Okay. Like, that doesn't sound so bad.

19:43.761 --> 19:45.160
Not so bad?

19:45.329 --> 19:49.231
It would destroy the very balance
of the supernatural order.

19:51.769 --> 19:53.760
This world would fall into chaos...

19:53.938 --> 19:57.101
...and the powers of Halloween night
would rule here forever...

19:57.274 --> 20:00.971
...turning everyone
into horrible Halloween monsters...

20:01.145 --> 20:03.978
...just like your friends.

20:04.148 --> 20:07.515
Well, when you put it that way...

20:09.353 --> 20:12.618
You must travel to the land
of the Halloween spirits.

20:12.790 --> 20:16.817
There you will seek the hidden castle
of the great Goblin King.

20:16.994 --> 20:20.896
Sneak into the castle undetected,
grab the Goblin Scepter...

20:21.065 --> 20:25.593
...and make your escape
before the stroke of midnight.

20:28.906 --> 20:30.168
Like, is that all?

20:30.341 --> 20:32.241
Scoob, old buddy, like, next year...

20:32.409 --> 20:36.641
...what do you say we just skip Halloween
and go right on to Thanksgiving?

20:41.552 --> 20:44.350
I wish there was more I could do for you,
but take these.

20:44.522 --> 20:47.355
They should serve you well
on the other side.

20:47.958 --> 20:50.085
A deck of cards?

20:50.261 --> 20:52.092
These are magic cards.

20:52.263 --> 20:53.924
Hold one out like so...

20:54.098 --> 20:55.963
...and read the inscription.

20:56.934 --> 21:00.392
Like, "demented disguises."

21:03.774 --> 21:07.972
Hey, check it out, Scoob.
Like, our very own monster mash-up.

21:08.145 --> 21:10.045
Cool.

21:11.782 --> 21:16.583
Marvelous.
You'll have no trouble blending in now, eh?

21:17.021 --> 21:19.751
- Let's try another one, Scoob.
- Okay.

21:19.924 --> 21:23.223
No, no, no.
You have to save them for emergencies.

21:23.394 --> 21:25.487
Each card can be used only once.

21:25.663 --> 21:29.622
And be careful,
each magic spell lasts but a short time.

21:31.368 --> 21:32.665
- Huh?
- Huh?

21:38.108 --> 21:41.339
Speaking of time,
you've got a train to catch.

22:05.236 --> 22:08.672
Like, check out that freaky freight train.

22:08.906 --> 22:11.136
Yeah, freaky.

22:17.047 --> 22:22.314
Attention. After-world Express
with one-way, nonstop service to:

22:22.786 --> 22:25.880
Sleepy Hollow, Hangman's Corner...

22:26.056 --> 22:29.822
...and Ghost Central Station.

22:30.661 --> 22:35.394
Scoob, old buddy,
I think we're in for the ride of our afterlives.

22:37.468 --> 22:41.837
One last thing. Whatever happens,
you must return by sunrise...

22:42.006 --> 22:44.668
...or be trapped
in the spirit world forever.

22:45.309 --> 22:49.006
Back by sunrise, trapped forever. Got it.

22:50.080 --> 22:53.277
But, like,
how are we supposed to get back?

22:54.385 --> 22:57.320
Oh, dear, I hadn't thought about that.

22:57.721 --> 22:59.712
- Huh?
- Huh?

23:41.332 --> 23:44.790
Zoinks. Don't look now, Scooby-Doo...

23:44.969 --> 23:49.065
...but I think we're riding
on the Grim Reaper railroad.

23:50.941 --> 23:55.844
Like, stop the train.
We want off this loco locomotive.

24:28.946 --> 24:31.312
Like, we made it, Scoob.
We're on the ground.

24:31.482 --> 24:34.144
The sweet, sweet ground.

24:40.024 --> 24:41.719
You there.

24:44.361 --> 24:46.454
What do you think you're doing, eh?

24:46.630 --> 24:51.624
Trying to sneak into my boneyard
while my back was turned?

24:55.773 --> 24:59.106
I think our disguises
have lost their charm.

24:59.843 --> 25:03.301
Oh, a couple of wiseacres, eh?

25:03.480 --> 25:08.213
Believe me, laddies,
you don't want to see my bad side.

25:24.101 --> 25:27.332
Like, this being your bad side?

25:30.374 --> 25:33.343
Time for a late-night snack.

25:33.510 --> 25:34.875
Like, hold on.

25:35.045 --> 25:37.605
You wouldn't eat
a fellow werewolf, would you?

25:37.781 --> 25:39.271
Huh?

25:39.450 --> 25:41.384
Observe.

26:00.637 --> 26:04.539
Stone me, it's one of my own brethren.

26:05.409 --> 26:07.274
Come on, then.

26:07.444 --> 26:09.309
Come on.

26:13.717 --> 26:16.811
Sorry about the rough reception, mate.

26:16.987 --> 26:20.616
Gotta keep out the riff-raff now,
don't we?

26:43.680 --> 26:47.980
Zoinks. Like, this is one
whacked-out watering hole.

26:53.190 --> 26:55.784
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

26:56.393 --> 26:58.918
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

27:01.899 --> 27:04.595
Okay, Scoob, like, just be cool.

27:04.768 --> 27:08.499
Yeah. Be cool.

27:11.275 --> 27:13.072
Like, great party, huh?

27:15.846 --> 27:19.907
So, what's a nice ghoul like you
doing in a place like this?

27:23.053 --> 27:26.819
Zoinks. Like, forget I asked.

27:30.160 --> 27:33.152
<i>Gather around your underground</i>
<i>And listen to a song</i>

27:33.330 --> 27:36.299
<i>We can rock this joint till dawn</i>
<i>If you sing along</i>

27:36.466 --> 27:38.457
- <i>Hey</i>
- <i>What goes bump in the night?</i>

27:38.635 --> 27:40.068
<i>We go bump in the night</i>

27:40.237 --> 27:43.400
<i>This time of year, the coast is clear</i>
<i>To cause a terrible fright</i>

27:43.574 --> 27:45.132
<i>We go bump in the night</i>

27:45.309 --> 27:47.004
<i>It'll be out of sight</i>

27:47.177 --> 27:48.644
<i>We come out for a bite</i>

27:48.812 --> 27:52.077
<i>Tonight we toast to ghouls and ghosts</i>
<i>Who haunt the pale moonlight</i>

27:52.249 --> 27:55.082
- <i>What goes bump in the night?</i>
- <i>We go bump in the night</i>

27:59.223 --> 28:01.123
<i>We go bump in the night</i>

28:07.364 --> 28:09.355
- <i>So if you're new</i>
- <i>Here's what you do</i>

28:09.533 --> 28:11.091
<i>Take your turn and sing</i>

28:11.268 --> 28:15.534
<i>Like, anybody know the way</i>
<i>To the castle of the Goblin King?</i>

28:20.510 --> 28:22.478
Goblin King?

28:42.466 --> 28:45.162
Like, was it something we said?

28:45.435 --> 28:49.337
Goblin patrol.
- Hold it right there.

28:49.906 --> 28:51.874
You've done it now, boys.

28:52.042 --> 28:55.739
No one dares speak of the Goblin King.

28:55.912 --> 28:59.780
- Ow. What'd you do that for?
- You said "Goblin King."

29:01.852 --> 29:03.444
- Hey.
- Don't say "Goblin King."

29:03.620 --> 29:04.644
You said it first.

29:04.821 --> 29:07.881
- Did not. You started it.
- I have a right to. You said it first.

29:08.058 --> 29:10.526
Come on, Scoob.
Right now is our chance to vamoose.

29:10.694 --> 29:12.161
Wait.
- You said it first.

29:12.329 --> 29:15.890
I can do what I want,
because I'm the first one in.

29:16.066 --> 29:18.227
Hang on there.

29:18.402 --> 29:20.302
Just where do you think you're going?

29:21.371 --> 29:24.568
It's off to the goblin dungeons for you.

29:24.741 --> 29:27.039
Come on, the party's just getting started.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.646
So tell me, goblin boy...

29:29.813 --> 29:32.805
...is this a private fight,
or can anybody join in?

29:32.983 --> 29:36.043
Like, why not? The more the scarier.

29:38.922 --> 29:43.518
Step aside, you.
Nobody messes with the Shadow Goblins.

29:43.860 --> 29:45.122
Ooh!

29:45.295 --> 29:48.856
What are you gonna do, breathe on me?
Ha-ha! If you wanna go a few rounds...

29:49.032 --> 29:51.432
...with old Jack o' Lantern
right here, right now...

29:51.601 --> 29:52.829
...let's rumble.

29:55.505 --> 29:58.201
Come on, take it easy there, Jack.

29:58.375 --> 30:01.401
Come on,
we're only doing our jobs. Please.

30:01.578 --> 30:06.515
Wait till we tell the Goblin King about this.
You're gonna be in so much trouble.

30:06.683 --> 30:08.583
- Shut it, will you?
- Hey, what'd I say?

30:08.752 --> 30:10.947
You said "Goblin King."

30:11.121 --> 30:12.850
You got me...
- Wanna get in trouble?

30:13.023 --> 30:15.014
You said "Goblin King."
- You're in trouble.

30:15.192 --> 30:16.784
You're the one that says it all the time.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.723
Psst. Hey, come on.

30:20.230 --> 30:22.664
This place is dead. Ha-ha!

30:31.375 --> 30:32.399
You better watch it.

30:32.576 --> 30:36.444
The last thing you want tonight are those
good-for-nothing goblins coming after you.

30:36.613 --> 30:39.912
But I gotta give you props.
The Goblin King's castle?

30:40.083 --> 30:42.881
What a riot.
You guys are whacked. I love it.

30:46.289 --> 30:49.122
So, like, does that mean you'll help us?

30:49.626 --> 30:53.323
Look, you guys crack me up,
but I can't hang with you.

30:53.497 --> 30:57.331
I got my own deadline tonight.
See my candle?

30:58.902 --> 31:02.235
That's how long I got
to get my Halloween on.

31:02.406 --> 31:06.206
Once it burns out, I'm burned out.
You know what I'm saying?

31:17.120 --> 31:19.987
Like, who's the creep
with the missing cranium?

31:20.157 --> 31:21.920
The Headless Horseman.

31:25.429 --> 31:27.488
I am so tired of working with this guy.

31:27.664 --> 31:29.757
Quick, you gotta help me.

32:26.056 --> 32:28.547
"Shield of safety."

32:46.943 --> 32:49.776
"Wall of gnome."

32:58.255 --> 33:00.086
"Force of flowers."

33:03.527 --> 33:05.722
"Clown calamity."

33:08.632 --> 33:11.032
"Baby on a frog."

33:20.377 --> 33:22.709
The magic cards.

34:06.890 --> 34:10.326
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

34:12.161 --> 34:13.857
I got him.

34:25.375 --> 34:29.243
Head for the covered bridge.
It's our only chance. Ah!

34:35.851 --> 34:38.377
Zoinks. Like, why did he stop?

34:38.554 --> 34:41.456
Well, duh,
that's the Horseman's one fatal flaw:

34:41.625 --> 34:44.219
He can't cross covered bridges.

34:45.562 --> 34:51.626
Like, I guess it's true what they say:
"It's tough to get ahead in this town."

34:55.839 --> 34:59.104
Shaggy, Scooby.

34:59.275 --> 35:00.902
Guess they're not here, either.

35:01.077 --> 35:03.602
This place is deserted.

35:04.247 --> 35:06.374
Not quite. Look.

35:20.764 --> 35:23.562
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

35:23.733 --> 35:28.033
...who's the most dreadful goblin of all?

35:29.906 --> 35:35.173
What wizard dare disturb
the great Goblin King?

35:37.180 --> 35:40.980
Greetings, your royal awfulness.

35:41.685 --> 35:46.315
The Amazing Krudsky, at your service.

35:46.790 --> 35:48.690
Foolish mortal...

35:48.858 --> 35:53.761
...to what purpose do you summon
the ruler of the goblin hordes?

35:54.364 --> 35:59.267
Say hello to my little fairy friend.

36:02.238 --> 36:05.435
Fairy Princess Willow.

36:05.875 --> 36:08.742
Jeepers, a real-life fairy.

36:08.912 --> 36:11.210
Maybe Krudsky's magic is real after all.

36:11.381 --> 36:13.440
But that's impossible.

36:13.950 --> 36:17.545
Rational mind shutting down.

36:19.622 --> 36:23.615
What loathsome trickery is this?

36:23.793 --> 36:26.489
No tricks. Only a trade.

36:26.663 --> 36:30.429
Meet me at the clock tower, midnight-ish.

36:30.600 --> 36:36.630
There I shall release her to you
in return for your Goblin Scepter.

36:37.340 --> 36:39.831
Most foul and wicked wizard.

36:40.009 --> 36:43.467
You tempt powers beyond your grasp.

36:45.949 --> 36:49.885
You shall regret this.

36:53.056 --> 36:57.584
Soon, all the powers
of Halloween shall be mine...

36:57.761 --> 37:04.064
...and then I'll show that scruffy slacker
and his mangy mutt, Scooby-Doo...

37:04.234 --> 37:07.533
...a magic trick they'll never forget.

37:16.946 --> 37:19.278
Shaggy and Scooby are in big trouble.

37:20.016 --> 37:23.281
We've gotta find them
before that whacked-out warlock does.

37:23.453 --> 37:25.887
And what about that adorable little fairy?

37:26.055 --> 37:28.956
We can't just let that icky Goblin King
take her away.

37:29.125 --> 37:30.956
Right, Velma?

37:35.298 --> 37:37.391
Oh, no, Velma's fried.

37:37.567 --> 37:40.331
All this must have
overloaded her rational brain.

37:40.937 --> 37:42.962
Then it's up to us, Daphne.

37:43.139 --> 37:45.835
We've gotta get over to that
clock tower before midnight...

37:46.009 --> 37:48.068
...and set a trap for that magic maniac.

37:48.244 --> 37:49.905
Come on.

38:10.967 --> 38:14.869
End of the line, guys.
There's the witch's hut, just like I promised.

38:15.038 --> 38:18.599
Look, I gotta bounce, but they can
help you find the Goblin Castle.

38:18.775 --> 38:21.369
You know,
assuming they don't eat you first.

38:21.544 --> 38:22.738
- Eat us?
- Eat us?

38:23.179 --> 38:26.205
Are you sure
you won't come with us, Jack?

38:26.382 --> 38:30.443
Sorry, guys, but those old bags take
one look at me and, splat, I'm pumpkin pie.

38:30.620 --> 38:32.087
You know what I'm saying?

38:32.522 --> 38:35.457
But, like, how are we
gonna get along without you?

38:35.625 --> 38:38.116
We haven't got any magic left.

38:38.294 --> 38:40.762
Yeah, how?

38:41.464 --> 38:45.423
Are you kidding? You guys rescued me
from the Brainless Horseman, hello?

38:45.602 --> 38:47.092
That took real courage.

38:47.270 --> 38:51.206
And everybody knows courage
is the most powerful magic of all.

38:51.374 --> 38:55.708
Like, I hate to tell you,
but that wasn't courage, that was panic.

38:55.879 --> 38:59.178
Hey, whatever you call it,
it's working for you.

38:59.349 --> 39:04.616
Keep it unreal, and happy Halloween!

39:24.474 --> 39:27.807
<i>Boil and bubble, toil and trouble</i>

39:27.977 --> 39:32.539
<i>If it's too weak, then make it a double</i>

39:38.054 --> 39:41.956
For once in our lives, Scoob, like,
I hope we're too late for supper.

39:43.293 --> 39:47.127
It is very rude to linger in doorways.

39:51.301 --> 39:54.236
<i>Eye of snake and tongue of rat</i>

39:54.404 --> 39:58.500
<i>Pie of rhubarb, wing of bat</i>

40:01.110 --> 40:04.341
There, now. It's almost ready.

40:04.514 --> 40:06.345
Here, taste.

40:07.483 --> 40:10.452
No, thanks. I'd really rather...

40:17.460 --> 40:22.261
Boy, do I feel sluggish all of a sudden.
Zoinks!

40:23.833 --> 40:27.394
I knew it. Not enough dragon's tooth.

40:53.096 --> 40:57.032
Like, hang on, Scoob.
We gotta make a beeline from this feline.

41:02.538 --> 41:06.531
No, no, no. This will never do.

41:16.486 --> 41:21.014
Quite right. More meat on them this way.

41:24.293 --> 41:30.095
Come, my sweets.
We'd just love to have you for dinner.

41:35.671 --> 41:36.695
Wish we could stay...

41:36.873 --> 41:41.333
...but you see,
we just stopped in to ask for directions.

41:42.111 --> 41:45.877
Yes, we can guide you
to the hidden lair of the Goblin King.

41:46.049 --> 41:49.212
But first you must help us.

41:55.591 --> 41:58.116
There are bad omens everywhere tonight.

41:58.294 --> 42:01.821
Some dark force
has upset the supernatural balance.

42:01.998 --> 42:05.126
Catastrophe rides on the wind.

42:09.072 --> 42:11.802
I'm afraid I've had to cancel
my midnight ride.

42:11.974 --> 42:15.637
Naturally,
my magic broomstick is devastated.

42:17.580 --> 42:20.378
- Magic broomstick?
- Magic broomstick?

42:27.557 --> 42:30.993
Poor thing.
He was so looking forward to it.

42:31.561 --> 42:34.121
It's very bad
to break a magic broom's spirit.

42:34.297 --> 42:37.755
Once broken,
they are never the same again.

42:38.234 --> 42:40.566
All right, Broomy, enough moping.

42:40.736 --> 42:43.534
These nice boys
are going to take you out for a spin...

42:43.706 --> 42:45.936
...aren't you, boys?

42:47.343 --> 42:48.367
Scoob, old buddy...

42:48.544 --> 42:52.378
...like, why do I get the feeling
that we're the ones about to get spun?

42:52.548 --> 42:54.709
Oh, no.

42:56.853 --> 42:57.945
Now, hold on tight.

42:58.121 --> 43:01.181
Lean forward for faster,
back to slow down, and watch out:

43:01.357 --> 43:02.756
He's got a wild streak in him.

43:02.925 --> 43:05.621
Just loves to take off on you.
But don't let him.

43:06.062 --> 43:10.362
- Like, got all that, Scoob?
- No.

43:10.933 --> 43:13.424
Here, you'll need this
to get inside the castle.

43:13.603 --> 43:15.628
It's magic potion.

43:15.805 --> 43:19.901
My own secret recipe,
made from Scratch.

43:20.676 --> 43:22.541
Poor old Scratch.

43:29.886 --> 43:31.751
Take them to the old oak Grove.

43:31.921 --> 43:35.687
From there, the fairies will guide you
to the Goblin Castle.

43:35.858 --> 43:36.916
But beware.

43:37.093 --> 43:42.030
It's a hideous place filled
with the most horrible monsters imaginable.

43:42.198 --> 43:43.756
And do write.

44:19.936 --> 44:24.532
Hey, Scoob, I think
we're getting the hang of this thing.

44:24.707 --> 44:27.540
Scooby-dooby-doo!

44:33.883 --> 44:36.374
Hey, look. Let's shoot them down.

44:36.552 --> 44:39.988
Bring out the goblin blaster.

44:56.239 --> 44:58.104
Get them, get them.

45:16.926 --> 45:17.950
Fire.

45:24.433 --> 45:28.392
Mayday, mayday. We're going down.

45:54.563 --> 45:57.293
Like, are we dead?

45:57.466 --> 46:00.264
Of course you're not dead.

46:00.436 --> 46:02.063
You big sillies.

46:03.472 --> 46:05.997
Name's Sparkplug.

46:07.143 --> 46:09.407
I'm Honeybee.

46:11.280 --> 46:13.009
And I'm Tiddlywink.

46:13.182 --> 46:16.913
Welcome to the City of the Fairies.

46:22.224 --> 46:25.250
Look over here. Your broomstick.

46:27.630 --> 46:30.428
Oh, no. Poor Broomy.

46:30.866 --> 46:33.767
Broomy.

46:36.372 --> 46:37.532
Don't worry.

46:38.974 --> 46:42.205
A little fairy magic
will have him fixed up in no time.

46:45.348 --> 46:46.679
Wow.

46:46.849 --> 46:49.716
Like, who knew fairies
could be so friendly?

46:49.885 --> 46:51.147
Of course.

46:51.320 --> 46:53.948
We fairies use only good magic...

46:54.123 --> 46:58.389
...balancing out all the bad magic
used by the Shadow Goblins.

46:58.561 --> 47:03.555
- But tonight the balance is shifting.
- I fear something terrible is happening.

47:03.733 --> 47:04.757
We know all about it.

47:04.934 --> 47:08.961
If we can catch a lift to the Goblin Castle,
we may be able to stop it.

47:09.438 --> 47:13.204
We can show you the way,
but you'll never get inside.

47:13.376 --> 47:17.403
The castle will be crawling with guards
for the Goblins' Rave.

47:18.381 --> 47:20.178
- Goblins' Rave?
- Goblins' Rave?

47:20.349 --> 47:23.147
Yeah, she's right. You'll never get in.

47:23.319 --> 47:26.311
It's totally the biggest party of the year.

47:26.489 --> 47:29.083
You don't say?

47:29.258 --> 47:33.160
If there's one thing we know how to do,
it's crash a party.

47:33.329 --> 47:35.456
Yeah.

47:45.341 --> 47:48.003
The Goblin Graveyard
hides the secret entrance...

47:48.177 --> 47:51.203
...but it's only a one-way trip.

48:04.727 --> 48:08.060
Express elevator going down.

48:11.033 --> 48:14.867
Like, on second thought,
maybe we should just take the stairs.

48:15.037 --> 48:16.197
In you go.

48:18.774 --> 48:21.368
Bye-bye.

48:37.693 --> 48:42.426
Zoinks. Like, first floor,
creepy Goblin Castle.

48:47.169 --> 48:50.696
Come on, back up.
Knock it off, knock it off.

48:50.873 --> 48:55.207
You, get a shower. You stink.
You ain't on the list, you ain't getting in.

48:57.346 --> 48:59.371
Losers.

49:09.191 --> 49:11.352
Okay, Scoob.

49:15.664 --> 49:17.859
Here goes.

49:18.033 --> 49:19.830
Over the lips and past the gums.

49:20.002 --> 49:23.961
Look out, stomach,
you're not gonna like this.

49:26.208 --> 49:28.176
Oh, boy.

49:35.117 --> 49:37.381
Hello, boys.

49:41.590 --> 49:43.854
Hello.

49:50.900 --> 49:53.835
Hello, pretty ladies.

49:54.003 --> 49:56.096
Hello, gals.

49:56.272 --> 50:00.800
We... We don't see your kind
around here too often.

50:02.411 --> 50:06.643
I bet you say that
to all your goblin girlfriends.

50:11.020 --> 50:13.887
We just love goblin parties.

50:14.356 --> 50:17.120
Like, tell me, gruesome...

50:17.293 --> 50:20.126
...any chance you could use sneak us in?

50:20.763 --> 50:23.789
Well, I don't know.

50:23.966 --> 50:25.365
All right, all right.

50:25.534 --> 50:29.231
I'm gonna get in trouble for this,
but in you go.

50:29.405 --> 50:34.342
Like, thanks, you big horrible thing, you.

50:37.580 --> 50:39.673
She had it all going on.

50:39.848 --> 50:42.408
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but did you see her friend?

50:51.160 --> 50:53.151
What a dog.

51:00.502 --> 51:04.438
Rock 'n' roll, baby. Rock 'n' roll.

51:04.607 --> 51:06.131
It's midnight tonight.

51:06.308 --> 51:08.868
It's Halloween.

51:18.020 --> 51:19.487
Shaggy, look.

51:21.123 --> 51:23.956
That must be
His Royal Rottenness himself.

51:24.126 --> 51:27.618
And look, there's the Goblin Scepter.

51:30.733 --> 51:34.794
Zoinks! Only five minutes till midnight.

51:34.970 --> 51:37.700
We gotta grab the scepter
and hightail it out of here.

51:38.774 --> 51:40.708
Like, on the count of three. Ready?

51:41.310 --> 51:44.074
One, two, three.

51:44.246 --> 51:47.682
Well, hello, my lovelies.

51:51.687 --> 51:55.714
Don't be shy, now. Let's have a dance.

51:56.625 --> 51:59.287
Dance? Now?

52:00.229 --> 52:01.355
Hit it.

52:09.405 --> 52:12.499
Swing it, boys.

52:13.442 --> 52:14.534
Yeah.

53:03.692 --> 53:04.989
Zoinks!

53:05.761 --> 53:09.026
Like, only one minute to midnight, Scoob.

53:35.491 --> 53:37.254
What's this?

53:42.865 --> 53:45.925
Way to go, Scoob, old buddy.

53:46.101 --> 53:47.898
Gangway.

53:48.070 --> 53:51.938
Impostors. Seize them.

53:57.679 --> 53:59.476
Left turn, Scoob.

54:00.482 --> 54:02.973
Right turn, Scoob.

54:06.221 --> 54:08.849
Like, dead end.

54:13.896 --> 54:19.425
Who dares disrupt the Goblins' Rave?

54:20.769 --> 54:24.967
Like, don't mind us.
We were just leaving.

54:37.686 --> 54:42.419
The goblin hour has arrived.

54:52.501 --> 54:56.437
You are free, my minions.

55:02.044 --> 55:04.012
Go forth this night...

55:04.179 --> 55:09.310
...and let goblin mischief reign.

55:20.696 --> 55:24.427
O great one,
what you want we should do with them?

55:24.600 --> 55:27.091
Yeah, what do we do? What do we do?

55:27.269 --> 55:31.103
Take them to the tower dungeon.

55:32.174 --> 55:34.301
Tower dungeon?

55:34.476 --> 55:37.104
Like, any chance we could put in
for an upgrade?

55:37.279 --> 55:38.439
Enough talk.

55:38.614 --> 55:42.277
Be thankful that I have more urgent matters
to deal with.

55:42.451 --> 55:44.282
Take them away.

56:09.177 --> 56:12.476
Show yourself, wicked warlock.

56:12.915 --> 56:16.146
Greetings, Your Majestic Malignancy.

56:16.518 --> 56:21.319
Thank you for coming.
I do so admire your punctuality.

56:21.757 --> 56:26.490
Show me the princess or be destroyed.

56:29.464 --> 56:32.262
You wouldn't dare use magic
against me...

56:32.434 --> 56:35.267
...so long as I have her under my spell.

56:35.437 --> 56:40.670
Why, here she is now, unharmed,
as promised.

56:40.842 --> 56:44.676
And now, if you please,
the Goblin Scepter.

56:46.014 --> 56:47.845
Beware, mortal.

56:48.016 --> 56:52.112
You know not
the powers you are dealing with.

56:52.387 --> 56:54.947
- Jeepers.
- Shh!

56:55.290 --> 56:58.282
Blahbiddy, blah, blah, blah.
Cough it up already.

57:00.829 --> 57:04.356
So be it.

57:17.713 --> 57:19.510
Now, Daphne.

57:28.824 --> 57:29.848
Gotcha.

57:34.463 --> 57:36.431
Ladies and gentlemen...

57:36.598 --> 57:42.730
...the Amazing Krudsky, version 2.0.

57:47.609 --> 57:52.410
Well, well.
Look at the big, bad Goblin King.

57:52.581 --> 57:55.015
Release me at once.

57:55.183 --> 57:58.846
I'll take over from here, junior.

57:59.621 --> 58:02.749
No!

58:09.231 --> 58:10.721
Now, who's next?

58:10.899 --> 58:14.733
Okay. That was not part of the plan.

58:14.903 --> 58:17.201
Run for it.

58:21.777 --> 58:25.304
Shadow Goblins, have your fun.

58:25.714 --> 58:29.115
Halloween has just begun.

58:35.624 --> 58:38.388
Boy, Scoob, did we screw up this time.

58:39.795 --> 58:42.229
Like, game over.

58:42.798 --> 58:46.734
Yeah, game over.

58:46.902 --> 58:49.234
Now we'll never make it back
before sunrise...

58:49.404 --> 58:52.737
...and be trapped
in the spirit world forever.

58:52.908 --> 58:57.140
Still, we gave it one heck of a try,
didn't we, Scoob?

58:57.312 --> 58:58.904
We did?

58:59.614 --> 59:01.980
I mean, think about how far we came.

59:02.150 --> 59:05.119
That took courage, stamina, brains.

59:05.287 --> 59:08.085
And, like, those are things we don't have.

59:08.256 --> 59:10.690
Yeah. Uh-uh.

59:12.094 --> 59:16.758
I just wish we had one more chance
to save the day.

59:17.132 --> 59:19.657
Did somebody say "wish"?

59:22.003 --> 59:25.336
Lucky for you,
granting wishes is what we do best.

59:25.740 --> 59:28.265
Hey, our fairy friends.

59:28.443 --> 59:30.172
Like, we're saved.

59:30.345 --> 59:32.404
Yippee!

59:32.581 --> 59:35.744
Hey, good for you guys.

59:37.018 --> 59:39.680
Well, come on. Your ride is here.

59:47.963 --> 59:49.931
Shaggy, look.

59:50.899 --> 59:53.367
Broomy, you're back in action.

59:54.536 --> 59:58.336
Come on, Scoob.
Like, we're going for the sweep.

01:00:05.847 --> 01:00:07.974
What's up, dog?

01:00:09.017 --> 01:00:11.178
Jack, you came back.

01:00:11.353 --> 01:00:15.255
Hey, there's still a little fire left
in this old pumpkin.

01:00:15.423 --> 01:00:17.516
Come on. Let's carve.

01:00:24.032 --> 01:00:26.262
Whoo-hOOGIE!

01:00:30.405 --> 01:00:34.102
Tonight, Halloween
is under new management.

01:00:35.243 --> 01:00:37.575
All hail the Goblin King.

01:00:37.746 --> 01:00:40.442
What is your command, o great one?

01:00:44.786 --> 01:00:49.223
How about a little target practice?

01:00:56.164 --> 01:00:59.224
What's happening? Where am I?

01:01:00.235 --> 01:01:01.759
Not so fast.

01:01:01.937 --> 01:01:04.030
Jinkies.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:10.276
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
the Monstrous Machine.

01:01:11.646 --> 01:01:14.706
Look out. The van's coming apart.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.119
Now, that is something you just do not do
to a guy's van.

01:01:31.466 --> 01:01:33.331
Run!

01:01:36.438 --> 01:01:39.168
Head for the carnival.

01:01:42.244 --> 01:01:43.734
Jinkies.

01:02:21.182 --> 01:02:23.707
Jeepers, we're stuck.

01:02:31.426 --> 01:02:36.454
This shall teach you to meddle
in the affairs of magicians.

01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:39.661
- Do something, Freddie.
- I am doing something.

01:02:39.834 --> 01:02:40.858
I'm panicking.

01:02:41.369 --> 01:02:44.634
Oh, Scooby-Doo. Where are you?

01:03:10.799 --> 01:03:14.565
At last. My magic powers are complete.

01:03:14.736 --> 01:03:17.705
Who could dare stop me now?

01:03:17.872 --> 01:03:21.467
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

01:03:30.885 --> 01:03:33.012
Take that.

01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:37.690
Hang on. We're coming around.

01:03:39.761 --> 01:03:42.025
Here we go, Jack.

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:44.298
Yee-haw!

01:04:00.448 --> 01:04:02.279
Like, nice catch, Scoob.

01:04:08.123 --> 01:04:09.590
Scoob?

01:04:20.568 --> 01:04:24.299
I've had it up to here
with you meddling meddlers.

01:04:24.472 --> 01:04:28.340
The Goblin Scepter is mine.
Let me have it.

01:04:29.844 --> 01:04:34.440
You heard the man, Scoob.
Like, let him have it.

01:04:39.821 --> 01:04:40.981
I hate you.

01:04:49.597 --> 01:04:53.624
Like, who says you can't
teach an old dog new tricks?

01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:12.378
Oh, thank heavens.

01:05:15.123 --> 01:05:17.591
Look, gang.

01:05:18.827 --> 01:05:20.351
The spell is broken.

01:05:20.528 --> 01:05:22.496
I'm free.

01:05:23.998 --> 01:05:26.796
Uh-oh. But not for long.

01:05:44.285 --> 01:05:45.946
I got you, Scoob.

01:05:46.154 --> 01:05:47.849
You ham-fisted hecklers.

01:05:48.022 --> 01:05:51.514
Just wait until I...

01:05:52.727 --> 01:05:56.754
Trick or treat.

01:05:59.968 --> 01:06:01.026
No!

01:06:02.136 --> 01:06:03.763
Princess Willow...

01:06:03.938 --> 01:06:08.671
...the trouble you have caused this night
is inexcusable.

01:06:08.843 --> 01:06:12.973
I know, and I'm sorry, Daddy.

01:06:13.715 --> 01:06:15.615
Daddy?

01:06:15.783 --> 01:06:19.913
I shouldn't have snuck out early,
and I'll never do it again, I promise.

01:06:20.088 --> 01:06:25.788
As of now, you are officially
grounded for one year...

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:31.091
...but I'm awfully glad to have you back,
my little princess.

01:06:31.699 --> 01:06:34.998
So all's forgiven, then?

01:06:36.838 --> 01:06:41.639
You know, Krudsky,
you really are my kind of guy.

01:06:42.143 --> 01:06:43.167
Really?

01:06:43.344 --> 01:06:45.642
You mean you'll help me with my career?

01:06:45.813 --> 01:06:48.509
Let's just say where you're going...

01:06:48.683 --> 01:06:52.915
...you'll have lots of time
to practice your act.

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.069
No, I don't wanna go back yet.

01:07:09.237 --> 01:07:11.330
Do we have to?

01:07:11.506 --> 01:07:14.031
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:07:18.313 --> 01:07:20.042
Poor old Jack.

01:07:20.214 --> 01:07:24.014
He's all burnt out for another year.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.854
Looks like our time is up.

01:07:28.022 --> 01:07:30.354
We'd best say our goodbyes now.

01:07:30.792 --> 01:07:32.350
- Goodbyes?
- Goodbyes?

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.888
Come along, Broomy.
It's time we got you home.

01:07:36.064 --> 01:07:37.793
Great job, my young wizards.

01:07:37.966 --> 01:07:41.561
Be sure to stop by the magic shop
next year.

01:07:41.736 --> 01:07:44.864
Your Majesty, if you please.

01:07:51.145 --> 01:07:55.309
Hey, hey! What do you say?
Jack lives to see another day.

01:07:55.483 --> 01:07:57.576
Yippee!

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.749
Hey, take it easy, Scoob.

01:08:00.922 --> 01:08:03.550
You're gonna slobber
my new candle out. Hey.

01:08:03.725 --> 01:08:07.183
Come on, Jack. Time to fly.

01:08:07.395 --> 01:08:08.885
Gotta buzz, coz.

01:08:09.063 --> 01:08:13.056
Jack o'Lantern out!

01:08:14.035 --> 01:08:15.866
Thank you all so much.

01:08:16.037 --> 01:08:19.803
May the magic of the fairies be with you.

01:08:21.376 --> 01:08:24.777
Like, I'll never, ever forget this.

01:08:24.946 --> 01:08:26.504
Me neither.

01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:31.884
Bravest of mortals,
you shall indeed remember...

01:08:32.053 --> 01:08:35.022
...but all others must forget.

01:08:35.456 --> 01:08:38.584
<i>By the shining rays of dawn</i>

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.094
<i>All memory of this night be gone</i>

01:08:45.366 --> 01:08:48.665
I want my mommy!

01:09:09.256 --> 01:09:11.087
- What just happened?
- Hey, gang!

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.618
Like, where you been?

01:09:14.796 --> 01:09:17.127
We've been looking all over for you.

01:09:17.564 --> 01:09:19.658
Shaggy. Scooby.

01:09:19.834 --> 01:09:21.961
What happened to you guys last night?

01:09:25.606 --> 01:09:29.542
Like, you wouldn't believe us
if we told you.

01:09:41.421 --> 01:09:45.153
Well, gang, another Halloween carnival
come and gone.

01:09:45.326 --> 01:09:46.520
I hate to say it...

01:09:46.694 --> 01:09:50.562
...but don't you think we're getting
a little old for this stuff, Freddie?

01:09:51.099 --> 01:09:53.294
It does seem a little bit silly
to go around...

01:09:53.468 --> 01:09:56.369
...pretending to believe in monsters
and magic.

01:09:56.537 --> 01:09:58.937
Even if it is just one night a year.

01:09:59.107 --> 01:10:02.167
Real or unreal?
Like, what's the difference?

01:10:02.944 --> 01:10:03.968
Like, the truth is...

01:10:04.145 --> 01:10:07.444
...you never know where your next scare
is gonna come from.

01:10:07.615 --> 01:10:12.712
You've just gotta find the courage
to deal with it face to face.

01:10:16.257 --> 01:10:17.554
Zoinks!

01:10:18.559 --> 01:10:22.086
Like, it's that headless horror
from the Halloween world.

01:10:26.501 --> 01:10:29.595
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:32.831
Hit it!

01:10:33.305 --> 01:10:39.623
