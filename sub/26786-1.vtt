Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:44.569 --> 01:45.434
Get in here before they come,

01:45.436 --> 01:46.706
I can hear them.

01:49.841 --> 01:51.310
I can hear them.

01:57.516 --> 01:58.481
Take my sword.

01:58.483 --> 01:59.618
You must keep moving.

02:02.587 --> 02:04.220
Robin!

02:32.450 --> 02:33.917
Father!

02:33.919 --> 02:34.787
Father!

02:35.753 --> 02:36.752
What, what's happened?

02:36.754 --> 02:38.358
I'm fine, but...

02:40.225 --> 02:42.491
What have you done to my son?

02:42.493 --> 02:43.427
You wouldn't listen would you?

02:43.429 --> 02:45.164
Who was searching?

02:52.003 --> 02:53.605
- Mary, fetch some water.
- Go.

02:54.539 --> 02:55.405
What happened?

02:55.407 --> 02:57.376
Robin's impatience has led to
this!

02:58.943 --> 03:00.776
- What, what's happened?
- He saved us!

03:00.778 --> 03:03.348
He put you in danger in
the first place, child!

03:05.683 --> 03:06.583
Reckless!

03:06.585 --> 03:08.288
Robin you are reckless!

03:09.655 --> 03:10.921
I was teaching them to hunt
for food

03:10.923 --> 03:13.259
when we were set upon
by the sheriff's men!

03:15.961 --> 03:18.394
I did not put them in harm's
way!

03:18.396 --> 03:21.334
Do not assume the blame
always lies with me!

03:22.334 --> 03:23.667
You're scaring the children.

03:23.669 --> 03:24.500
He saved us.

03:24.502 --> 03:26.305
Quiet child, stop defending
him!

03:27.772 --> 03:29.873
That's, that's my son!

03:29.875 --> 03:30.742
John stop.

03:31.576 --> 03:33.513
He needs you right now, be with
him.

03:44.590 --> 03:45.925
They all look to you, Robin.

03:53.532 --> 03:55.235
Will, please be on lookout.

04:07.045 --> 04:09.983
The bravest warrior I've ever
seen.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.884
He'll live to fight another day.

04:14.586 --> 04:16.355
His scar in battle, I'm
jealous.

04:22.494 --> 04:24.597
Come, let's give them space.

04:31.036 --> 04:32.569
Perhaps teaching them so young
is an

04:32.571 --> 04:35.404
indulgence you can not yet
afford.

04:35.406 --> 04:36.474
An indulgence?

04:40.545 --> 04:42.649
They must learn how to
fend for themselves.

04:45.016 --> 04:46.048
Our numbers increase by the day

04:46.050 --> 04:47.483
and they've all become targets.

04:47.485 --> 04:48.784
Your feud with the sheriff
should

04:48.786 --> 04:50.786
not be everyone's feud.

04:50.788 --> 04:52.555
We weren't trespassing,
it was an open forest.

04:52.557 --> 04:54.623
What we're doing is dangerous.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.692
We anger those that do not
share the same point of view.

04:56.694 --> 04:57.961
Those that anger at us for
what we take

04:57.963 --> 04:59.029
up too much to begin with.

04:59.031 --> 05:00.600
But they still anger.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.769
And they want to reclaim
what was once theirs.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.973
You cannot deny the truth in
what I say.

05:11.076 --> 05:13.379
John fears you cannot control
yourself.

05:14.646 --> 05:16.516
And that things will only get
worse.

05:24.622 --> 05:26.959
I fear what the future holds.

05:32.163 --> 05:34.500
We must take a stand
against the sheriff.

05:35.666 --> 05:36.568
We must fight.

05:39.637 --> 05:40.505
I know.

05:43.742 --> 05:45.778
But these people are not
warriors, Robin.

05:47.012 --> 05:48.881
You must have patience with
them.

06:24.916 --> 06:26.882
A little bird tells
me you've been supplying

06:26.884 --> 06:28.521
Robin Hood with grain.

06:29.654 --> 06:30.822
Could this be true?

06:31.923 --> 06:33.490
No.

06:33.492 --> 06:34.990
It's not.

06:34.992 --> 06:36.428
It's not true.

06:40.165 --> 06:42.435
You're quite fond of mead, I
hear.

06:45.069 --> 06:47.236
Helps free up the tongue.

06:47.238 --> 06:48.673
You drunken fool!

06:49.641 --> 06:51.544
You never know who may be
listening.

06:58.951 --> 06:59.919
I'll ask again.

07:18.903 --> 07:19.771
Could

07:21.639 --> 07:22.507
this

07:26.077 --> 07:26.945
be

07:29.281 --> 07:30.149
true?

07:32.250 --> 07:33.649
Yes, yes!

07:33.651 --> 07:34.620
Yes it's true.

07:35.586 --> 07:36.956
Lead me to him

07:40.959 --> 07:42.194
and I won't gut your wife.

07:44.062 --> 07:46.596
I don't know where he is!

07:46.598 --> 07:47.964
Huh.

07:47.966 --> 07:48.964
It's Mari.

07:48.966 --> 07:49.836
Mm.

07:51.069 --> 07:53.738
Lady Marian and some
children collect the grain.

08:01.146 --> 08:03.649
Robin Hood will stop you.

08:08.319 --> 08:11.957
I can't see him coming to
rescue you.

08:15.093 --> 08:15.962
Do you?

08:38.716 --> 08:40.251
Let me tell you about my new
taxes

08:42.187 --> 08:44.253
so that you may continue to
provide

08:44.255 --> 08:45.524
for me and my people

08:47.793 --> 08:49.161
without too many disruptions.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.774
This is your crop.

09:04.308 --> 09:05.177
These are mine.

09:06.979 --> 09:07.980
And this is for you.

09:08.879 --> 09:10.046
But if you don't tell me where I
can

09:10.048 --> 09:11.583
find the Lady Marian,

09:13.217 --> 09:14.152
well then...

09:27.298 --> 09:30.269
At least you can save
your children's lives.

09:33.238 --> 09:34.807
Because if you don't tell me,

09:38.243 --> 09:39.312
they're next.

09:54.326 --> 09:56.896
Mary described how
they fought yesterday.

09:59.063 --> 10:00.131
How Robin saved them.

10:03.835 --> 10:04.704
She's brave.

10:06.437 --> 10:07.340
But lucky too.

10:11.143 --> 10:12.912
When do I get to fight?

10:17.081 --> 10:18.748
Fetch some more pails Much.

10:33.999 --> 10:36.002
- I tried.
- And you lost.

10:36.934 --> 10:38.269
I came to join your fight.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.705
I'm sorry I was foolish.

10:42.707 --> 10:43.373
Go go!

10:43.375 --> 10:45.108
I fear, I fear I've led

10:45.110 --> 10:46.678
the enemy right to you.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.113
I thought I'd lost them in the
marshes

10:50.115 --> 10:51.047
as they entered the forest

10:51.049 --> 10:53.952
but they must have picked up on
my tracks.

10:57.288 --> 10:59.455
You must tell Robin Hood

10:59.457 --> 11:01.925
this place is no longer safe.

11:01.927 --> 11:02.791
Please.

11:02.793 --> 11:03.493
How many?

11:40.899 --> 11:44.400
We have orders to keep you
alive!

11:44.402 --> 11:46.268
Then you're at a disadvantage.

12:05.123 --> 12:08.557
There's no doubt in my
mind, he did save his life.

12:08.559 --> 12:11.196
He's a reckless thief
who will get us all killed.

12:12.096 --> 12:13.963
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:13.965 --> 12:15.430
What are you doing?

12:15.432 --> 12:16.265
I need Robin's help.

12:16.267 --> 12:17.566
Whatever it is, I can deal
with it.

12:17.568 --> 12:18.968
What's happened?

12:18.970 --> 12:21.036
I think it was the sheriff's
men.

12:21.038 --> 12:21.907
I was set upon.

12:23.207 --> 12:24.873
It's not mine.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.844
I ran as fast as I could to
get away from the carnage.

12:27.846 --> 12:28.913
I killed one of them.

12:30.414 --> 12:31.281
Should we get some help?

12:31.283 --> 12:32.515
No, no, no, no.

12:32.517 --> 12:34.850
There's more chance of being
spotted.

12:34.852 --> 12:37.286
Come on lad, quickly, show me.

12:37.288 --> 12:38.157
Come on!

12:56.575 --> 12:57.777
Stop this!

13:01.312 --> 13:02.911
You we must keep alive,

13:02.913 --> 13:05.850
but as for the boy, we
have no such instruction!

13:06.884 --> 13:07.819
I'm sorry Marian!

13:17.495 --> 13:18.364
How far?

13:30.975 --> 13:31.910
Who is this?

13:36.214 --> 13:38.214
You know my name.

13:50.461 --> 13:52.364
I think I see an outlaw.

13:53.565 --> 13:54.433
Turncoat.

14:02.173 --> 14:03.241
Where's Robin Hood?

14:04.142 --> 14:05.277
I couldn't get to him.

14:12.350 --> 14:15.120
Well let's have some fun
with his friend instead then.

14:17.254 --> 14:19.457
Soon enough others will
come looking for him.

14:22.192 --> 14:23.062
On your knees.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.269
On your knees!

14:42.480 --> 14:43.449
Look at me.

14:44.649 --> 14:45.583
Look at me.

14:47.085 --> 14:49.655
Do you see how easy it
is for us to find you?

14:55.427 --> 14:57.363
Not too clever are you?

14:59.230 --> 15:01.097
I know what I would do

15:01.099 --> 15:03.733
if another man invaded my home.

15:14.011 --> 15:15.111
We're under attack!

15:15.113 --> 15:17.113
Take those that cannot
fight into the lower caves.

15:17.115 --> 15:18.613
It's done.

15:18.615 --> 15:19.482
Go with the others

15:19.484 --> 15:20.717
I can fight.

15:20.719 --> 15:22.484
Your brother needs you and
your father wouldn't approve.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.488
Please Mary, go, go!

15:27.125 --> 15:29.461
Are you gonna take me
to Robin Hood or not?

15:33.398 --> 15:34.763
How could you?

15:34.765 --> 15:36.168
Blood on your hands.

15:39.671 --> 15:41.006
Think on that.

15:45.275 --> 15:46.144
Tracks.

16:06.063 --> 16:10.065
Well he can't think
very much of you, can he?

16:10.067 --> 16:11.434
Where is he?

16:11.436 --> 16:13.669
Even your own men are abandon
you,

16:13.671 --> 16:16.372
so what chance do any of you
have?

16:16.374 --> 16:18.608
The best thing that you could do

16:18.610 --> 16:20.611
is lead me to Robin Hood now!

16:26.551 --> 16:27.419
Think.

16:32.222 --> 16:34.293
I am growing impatient!

16:46.538 --> 16:47.706
So take the hideout.

16:52.076 --> 16:53.211
Butcher the children.

16:54.745 --> 16:55.780
Then their loyalty will falter.

16:57.414 --> 16:59.681
And Robin Hood will be found
soon enough.

16:59.683 --> 17:04.690
Stop!

17:05.323 --> 17:06.191
Robin!

17:07.192 --> 17:08.460
Finally!

17:10.627 --> 17:13.064
I've been sent here to negotiate

17:14.365 --> 17:16.798
the Lady Marian and the worm boy
Much

17:16.800 --> 17:17.866
are in our possession.

17:17.867 --> 17:20.603
Now the terms of their release,

17:20.605 --> 17:22.173
her hand in marriage

17:23.374 --> 17:25.607
and your head on a spike.

17:35.519 --> 17:38.554
Will!

17:50.667 --> 17:52.471
I thought you were one of us,
Brom.

17:56.307 --> 17:57.809
Are you loyal to the sheriff
now?

17:58.876 --> 18:00.142
I wanted protection.

18:00.144 --> 18:02.580
Protection from what, outlaws?

18:07.384 --> 18:08.784
Yes.

18:08.786 --> 18:09.654
Like us?

18:14.526 --> 18:15.861
The ones who cared for you?

18:20.265 --> 18:21.930
I chose the sheriff over you,
Robin.

18:21.932 --> 18:23.701
There's nothing you can do that
scares me.

18:24.635 --> 18:25.671
I have a newborn son.

18:27.204 --> 18:28.871
I thought the stronghold
the only true safe haven,

18:28.873 --> 18:31.474
I only did what I thought was
right.

18:41.618 --> 18:42.620
Robin, no.

18:43.954 --> 18:45.955
Please, Robin!

18:45.957 --> 18:48.391
Robin, no, no!

18:55.567 --> 18:57.236
Will you help me?

18:59.671 --> 19:00.739
For your son?

19:03.974 --> 19:05.708
You've betrayed us, Brom,
but I'm gonna give you

19:05.710 --> 19:07.145
the chance to make amends.

19:14.986 --> 19:15.921
Start talking.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.826
Beyond those trees, their
horses.

19:24.828 --> 19:26.661
How did they find us?

19:26.663 --> 19:27.963
I didn't tell them.

19:27.965 --> 19:29.667
They knew exactly where to look.

19:36.673 --> 19:38.309
They murdered a farmer.

19:40.545 --> 19:41.413
Robin.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.578
This has to stop.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.480
Innocent people are dying!

19:45.482 --> 19:47.286
The forest can no
longer protect us, John.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.355
Brom left 'cause he no longer
felt safe.

19:53.290 --> 19:55.860
And now the sheriff is
using our allies against us.

19:57.494 --> 19:58.896
The time to fight back is now.

20:00.932 --> 20:03.868
Our enemies have Marian and
Much.

20:06.537 --> 20:09.005
And I intend to get them back.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.907
We're outnumbered, it's
impossible.

20:11.909 --> 20:13.776
You'll die!

20:13.778 --> 20:14.610
I have to do something.

20:14.612 --> 20:15.478
You'll get yourself
killed!

20:15.480 --> 20:17.783
If I go alone then that will
be true.

20:19.349 --> 20:20.415
Yesterday you learned that these
men

20:20.417 --> 20:21.786
don't care who they hurt.

20:24.756 --> 20:25.791
Your own son, John.

20:31.695 --> 20:33.298
And your daughter.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.641
Your children are brave,
much like their father.

20:44.608 --> 20:46.577
They're not as reckless as you
believe.

20:52.317 --> 20:53.716
Is there no other way?

20:53.718 --> 20:55.617
The peace is shattered.

20:55.619 --> 20:57.353
It may make things worse.

20:57.355 --> 20:58.789
If we fail, that may be true.

20:59.757 --> 21:00.726
I came home,

21:02.359 --> 21:05.861
we came home to a land
plagued with injustice,

21:05.863 --> 21:07.363
and I intend to confront that
cause

21:07.365 --> 21:08.933
and not hide from it in the
trees.

21:11.903 --> 21:13.739
The sheriff has forced our hand.

21:15.972 --> 21:17.440
If we cannot protect the people
we love

21:17.442 --> 21:18.509
then what good are we?

21:19.509 --> 21:20.645
I am with you, Robin.

21:22.380 --> 21:23.048
Always.

21:25.516 --> 21:28.351
I'm not a soldier like you
two.

21:28.353 --> 21:29.985
I'm just a simple farmer.

21:29.987 --> 21:32.755
Never seen a better
fighter than you, John.

21:32.757 --> 21:35.027
Whether we like it or
not, this is happening.

21:37.627 --> 21:38.594
Now you may not like my methods

21:38.596 --> 21:40.832
but I intend to take
the fight to the enemy.

21:42.834 --> 21:43.935
This is not life.

21:51.541 --> 21:54.043
I want nothing more than
to protect my family, Robin,

21:54.045 --> 21:55.811
you know that.

21:55.813 --> 21:59.849
Then take up arms.

21:59.851 --> 22:00.719
Tell me.

22:02.553 --> 22:03.455
What was the plan?

22:04.922 --> 22:07.390
We were to capture you or kill
you

22:07.392 --> 22:09.027
and then report back to the
sheriff.

22:10.461 --> 22:12.797
And the report would
proclaim Robin Hood a coward.

22:16.867 --> 22:19.701
He heard the terms and
decided to go into hiding.

22:19.703 --> 22:21.703
You've killed the sheriff's
cousin.

22:21.705 --> 22:22.940
He was to make the report.

22:28.679 --> 22:31.146
There were four men who rode
out.

22:31.148 --> 22:32.583
Then four will return.

22:35.118 --> 22:36.120
I'm coming with you.

22:38.689 --> 22:40.659
Darkness will be our ally.

22:41.992 --> 22:43.662
Tell the others what's happened.

22:44.662 --> 22:46.064
Go into hiding into the caves.

22:47.531 --> 22:48.863
If we are not back by sunset
tomorrow

22:48.865 --> 22:50.632
then we're likely not back at
all.

22:50.634 --> 22:53.201
And then you need to find new
shelter.

22:59.042 --> 22:59.910
Be brave.

24:06.644 --> 24:08.078
Remember your son, Brom.

24:11.816 --> 24:13.018
Open the gate!

24:15.952 --> 24:16.821
Rabbit!

24:18.088 --> 24:19.156
Today's gate word.

24:21.157 --> 24:22.927
If this doesn't work, then
what?

24:24.862 --> 24:26.031
Then we all die, John.

24:26.963 --> 24:27.832
Oh.

24:31.201 --> 24:32.237
Lead the way, Brom.

24:34.971 --> 24:37.273
Stay close to the shadows.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.700
So now perhaps you'll see what
happens

25:38.702 --> 25:40.305
when people take things from me.

25:58.355 --> 26:03.327
Robin Hood must watch while
others round him suffer and die.

26:22.646 --> 26:24.214
If my cousin has done his job,

26:27.018 --> 26:28.620
then they'll be here soon.

26:30.921 --> 26:33.792
If he failed, we can't expect
the savage

26:36.126 --> 26:38.195
not to retaliate now, can we?

26:39.296 --> 26:41.032
To mount a rescue attempt?

26:42.232 --> 26:44.668
I will chop him up into pieces

26:45.435 --> 26:48.173
and parade his disembodied
parts for all to see.

26:57.448 --> 27:00.251
Here is what the man was made
of.

27:01.919 --> 27:03.919
You are gutless.

27:03.921 --> 27:05.789
And you slum with the feral.

27:07.724 --> 27:09.057
A woman of your stature

27:09.059 --> 27:11.059
reduced to living with the
animals,

27:11.061 --> 27:13.631
giving up stone and noble
providence for debt.

27:16.733 --> 27:19.069
I'm curious as to why you
would do such a thing.

27:20.237 --> 27:21.373
For love, perhaps.

27:23.406 --> 27:25.644
A stupid notion but one I can
use.

27:26.876 --> 27:28.078
You're not afraid, woman.

27:32.383 --> 27:34.853
I think you underestimate my
cruelty.

27:37.821 --> 27:40.190
I will rip you apart.

27:44.161 --> 27:45.029
Hmm.

27:47.163 --> 27:49.731
Marry me.

27:49.733 --> 27:52.936
Save the people, save
yourself, save this mongrel.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.886
You see this is your weakness

28:11.888 --> 28:13.824
and it is not physical.

28:35.945 --> 28:37.014
Well come on.

28:39.048 --> 28:40.117
Bring me bad.

28:46.457 --> 28:48.793
When you become agreeable,

28:51.028 --> 28:53.731
I'll take your hand in
marriage, but if you don't,

28:55.332 --> 28:57.469
the first thing I will
take will be your hands.

29:03.440 --> 29:04.308
Ah.

29:06.042 --> 29:07.878
If they move, hurt them.

29:16.220 --> 29:18.019
Report to the sheriff.

29:18.021 --> 29:19.356
In time, good sir.

29:20.590 --> 29:24.058
Let us warm our hands by
the fire after a long ride.

29:24.060 --> 29:24.962
Weapons.

29:43.847 --> 29:45.847
Brom, do you know where
the prisoners are secured?

29:45.849 --> 29:47.315
I'm sorry, I don't.

29:47.317 --> 29:50.318
Access to many parts of the
stronghold are forbidden.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.319
We'll have to find our own
way, then.

29:51.321 --> 29:54.055
We cannot defend
ourselves without weapons.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.499
This is given to new soldiers.

30:03.567 --> 30:05.933
A route to the only accessible
armoury.

30:05.935 --> 30:07.102
A weaponry within for practise
only.

30:07.104 --> 30:09.036
Not for the rigours of battle.

30:09.038 --> 30:10.508
It'll have to do.

30:13.509 --> 30:14.846
Goodbye, Brom.

30:16.446 --> 30:17.314
Take care.

30:21.451 --> 30:22.316
What now?

30:22.318 --> 30:23.187
Make haste.

30:24.421 --> 30:25.554
The longer we linger
the greater the chance

30:25.556 --> 30:27.491
of us being discovered.

30:34.298 --> 30:36.166
Robin, where are we?

30:37.433 --> 30:40.971
That doorway should lead to
the armoury.

30:52.048 --> 30:52.914
Well?

30:52.916 --> 30:54.985
There's a big man guarding the
door.

31:04.494 --> 31:05.429
He is a big man.

31:07.364 --> 31:08.563
Robin.

31:08.565 --> 31:10.032
This is folly!

31:10.034 --> 31:12.133
What should we do, John?

31:12.135 --> 31:13.503
Should we turn back?

31:14.570 --> 31:15.939
Should I hand myself in?

31:16.941 --> 31:19.040
Would either of those solve our
problem?

31:19.042 --> 31:21.410
This is not brave, this is
stupid!

31:21.412 --> 31:23.146
- I tell you...
- Shh!

31:26.349 --> 31:28.452
I know there is truth
in what John would say.

31:29.486 --> 31:30.622
What choice do we have?

31:31.721 --> 31:33.023
There is no other way.

31:34.657 --> 31:37.558
You should do what you
think is right, Robin.

31:37.560 --> 31:38.528
I will follow you.

31:45.269 --> 31:47.471
There is no turning back.

31:49.539 --> 31:51.172
My good man.

31:51.174 --> 31:52.542
We need access to the armoury.

31:58.515 --> 32:01.152
I shall say it again, we
need access to the armoury.

32:02.318 --> 32:04.989
Are you deaf or stupid or both?

32:06.356 --> 32:10.191
Only instruction from
the sheriff or his cousin

32:10.193 --> 32:12.427
will have me open the gates.

32:12.429 --> 32:13.464
You should know that.

32:15.766 --> 32:17.435
Then I shall go and fetch Guy.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.073
The sheriff will be angry at the
delay.

32:23.673 --> 32:25.640
Robin Hood has infiltrated the
stronghold.

32:25.642 --> 32:26.876
We need those weapons now!

32:36.586 --> 32:37.786
Nice and subtle Robin, well
done!

32:37.788 --> 32:38.990
Thank you.

32:39.655 --> 32:43.260
- Robin!
- So, you're Robin Hood.

32:44.327 --> 32:47.362
John, little bit of help might
be nice.

33:03.646 --> 33:05.713
That's a shame he's not on our
side.

33:05.715 --> 33:06.650
Search him.

33:10.621 --> 33:12.720
- There's no keys.
- What?

33:12.722 --> 33:17.694
Got to be something.

33:22.231 --> 33:24.501
How long has she been there?

33:26.569 --> 33:29.173
The evening froth didn't agree
with him.

33:30.606 --> 33:31.742
He's delicate.

33:46.490 --> 33:48.026
Get that door open quick.

33:49.292 --> 33:51.426
Are you not an expert thief?

33:51.428 --> 33:53.164
Give me your belt.

33:55.398 --> 33:58.201
Praise your all this is useless
unless Will is successful.

33:59.836 --> 34:02.370
We have yet to be discovered,
John.

34:02.372 --> 34:03.240
Courage.

34:23.494 --> 34:25.360
Let me in!

34:25.362 --> 34:28.661
Turn around,
friend, before it's too late.

34:28.664 --> 34:30.500
Do you not recognise me?

34:31.835 --> 34:32.768
Should I?

34:33.804 --> 34:35.672
I'm Guy of Gisborne!

34:36.840 --> 34:39.242
Throw down a torch and
I'll show you my face!

34:40.643 --> 34:42.245
Now open the gate!

34:47.251 --> 34:49.120
- Hurry up!
- Very helpful.

34:50.652 --> 34:52.152
Should we not search
elsewhere?

34:52.155 --> 34:53.755
What can we do without
weapons, John?

34:53.757 --> 34:56.791
We have but one broadsword
between us.

34:56.793 --> 35:00.427
We get weapons, we get Marian,
we get out.

35:00.429 --> 35:01.630
A sword against an arrow

35:01.632 --> 35:03.231
is not a good match from
distance.

35:03.233 --> 35:04.900
What are you saying?

35:04.902 --> 35:05.836
Hurry up.

35:09.172 --> 35:10.572
- Yah!
- Dead end.

35:10.574 --> 35:11.876
Couldn't catch her in time.

35:13.610 --> 35:16.414
She will surely send word
of our arrival soon enough.

35:17.914 --> 35:18.782
Robin.

35:20.851 --> 35:21.719
John.

35:22.885 --> 35:23.784
Other routes?

35:23.786 --> 35:25.155
None that I saw.

35:26.623 --> 35:28.793
Get that door open or we're
all dead.

35:37.668 --> 35:38.536
Much.

35:40.304 --> 35:41.172
Much!

35:43.273 --> 35:44.142
Wake up.

35:48.445 --> 35:49.313
Come on.

35:50.313 --> 35:52.516
We need to get out of this.

35:59.523 --> 36:01.858
There's no way out of this.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.894
There's always a way.

36:05.896 --> 36:07.298
Come on, think!

36:15.739 --> 36:17.405
Sire, you're hurt, sire!

36:17.407 --> 36:18.442
Oh, out of my way!

36:20.376 --> 36:22.179
You, with me.

36:27.016 --> 36:28.650
Where's my cousin?

36:28.652 --> 36:31.353
I believe he's in his chamber,
sire.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.889
And not to be disturbed.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.360
Okay.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.662
You go to my quarters,
you get me some clothes,

36:40.664 --> 36:42.963
you meet me in my cousin's
chamber, go.

36:42.965 --> 36:43.833
Yes sire.

36:48.338 --> 36:49.340
Give me the sword.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.407
It's our only means
of defending ourselves.

36:52.409 --> 36:53.441
But we'll get this door open.

36:53.443 --> 36:54.612
Give me the sword.

37:01.284 --> 37:03.517
We're gonna die because the
famous thief

37:03.519 --> 37:04.989
couldn't unlock a door.

37:13.063 --> 37:15.030
We are not to be disturbed!

37:15.032 --> 37:17.969
Did I not give explicit
instructions?

37:19.302 --> 37:20.503
It's me, Guy!

37:21.938 --> 37:24.407
I've got news of Robin Hood!

37:34.818 --> 37:36.554
I was bettered in combat,
cousin.

37:37.521 --> 37:39.757
I told you not to
underestimate the savages.

37:40.891 --> 37:41.925
My men are dead.

37:43.360 --> 37:44.862
And they took our uniforms.

37:49.632 --> 37:50.835
So Robin Hood is here.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.306
Sire, sire!

37:57.106 --> 37:58.305
Let me guess.

37:58.307 --> 38:01.512
Three men sire are trying
to access the lower armoury.

38:02.746 --> 38:03.614
Wearing our uni...

38:06.048 --> 38:06.951
Gather some men.

38:07.918 --> 38:09.653
Let me take care of this.

38:11.454 --> 38:14.824
Let me correct my mistake.

38:22.065 --> 38:23.534
I'll fetch his whore

38:25.369 --> 38:27.405
and then I'll make her
watch while I gut him.

38:36.813 --> 38:37.682
Shh.

38:41.851 --> 38:43.450
If you're still here when I
return,

38:43.452 --> 38:46.086
I'll feed your eyes to the pigs.

39:03.172 --> 39:04.774
Much, come here!

39:24.094 --> 39:25.762
Much, listen to me.

39:28.431 --> 39:30.532
I know you're tired.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.668
I know you're hurt, but this is
it.

39:33.670 --> 39:34.938
We will die here.

39:36.539 --> 39:39.441
I'm sorry Marian
you're only here with me.

39:39.443 --> 39:40.874
It's not your fault.

39:40.876 --> 39:43.845
I know you're scared,
even Robin gets scared.

39:43.847 --> 39:44.878
We all do.

39:44.880 --> 39:45.949
Be brave.

39:48.784 --> 39:50.617
And hit these chains as hard as
you can,

39:50.619 --> 39:53.588
give it everything you've got!

40:00.197 --> 40:01.731
Here they come.

40:05.001 --> 40:05.867
Done.

40:08.737 --> 40:13.743
Get him!

40:22.518 --> 40:24.187
Where are my bowmen?

40:38.869 --> 40:41.836
Offering your services
to the sheriff now, Green?

40:41.838 --> 40:43.173
A man has to eat.

40:44.139 --> 40:46.139
Well the sheriff takes all our
food.

40:46.141 --> 40:47.110
We'll bolt the door.

40:48.644 --> 40:49.711
Well.

40:49.713 --> 40:50.979
This is going well so far.

40:50.981 --> 40:53.248
I thought you were better than
this!

40:53.250 --> 40:54.215
You two know each other?

40:54.217 --> 40:55.749
That's Green.

40:55.751 --> 40:56.784
He's a good man.

40:56.786 --> 40:58.519
Fearless in battle.

40:58.521 --> 41:00.621
Oh, oh that's Green.

41:00.623 --> 41:03.525
Well it looks like he wants to
kill us.

41:05.728 --> 41:06.797
Hello.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.796
Battering ram, now.

41:09.798 --> 41:10.668
Will.

41:16.206 --> 41:18.572
Guard, the boy is gone!

41:55.344 --> 41:56.978
I bear you no ill will, Robin.

41:56.980 --> 41:59.280
I'm simply following orders.

41:59.282 --> 42:00.748
The man who gives you orders
is a coward

42:00.750 --> 42:02.950
who puts innocents in harms way.

42:02.952 --> 42:05.619
Heave!

42:05.621 --> 42:06.920
Heave!

42:06.922 --> 42:07.921
Heave!

42:07.923 --> 42:08.791
Stop!

42:16.733 --> 42:17.601
Robin Hood.

42:22.072 --> 42:24.708
Oh, these wooden swords
will be great in battle.

42:26.976 --> 42:27.909
Better than nothing.

42:27.911 --> 42:29.677
If you would but surrender to
my cousin

42:29.679 --> 42:31.715
I am sure that he would see
reason.

42:32.681 --> 42:33.550
As would I.

42:35.018 --> 42:37.021
You steal what is not yours to
take.

42:38.788 --> 42:41.722
Isn't that the point of
stealing?

42:41.724 --> 42:42.389
He's simple.

42:42.391 --> 42:44.291
Even failed at dying.

42:44.293 --> 42:45.862
And now you're trespassing.

42:47.864 --> 42:49.666
And there is no way out.

42:51.701 --> 42:52.603
How can this be?

42:55.105 --> 42:56.106
Am I dreaming?

42:58.842 --> 43:00.110
I'm looking at a dead man.

43:01.811 --> 43:04.114
Just another one of
your failures, Robin Hood.

43:07.117 --> 43:09.117
My cousin wants to unite the
people

43:09.119 --> 43:12.155
and take Lady Marian's
hand in marriage whereas

43:14.257 --> 43:16.793
I'd prefer to watch her beg for
death.

43:21.731 --> 43:22.633
Don't believe me?

43:24.233 --> 43:24.965
Let me show you.

43:24.967 --> 43:27.267
- Green come here.
- Yes sir, sire.

43:27.269 --> 43:28.202
What?

43:28.204 --> 43:30.438
I would not underestimate
Robin Hood.

43:30.440 --> 43:32.206
I've fought alongside him many
times.

43:32.208 --> 43:33.240
I know that these men respect
you,

43:33.242 --> 43:35.108
and that's useful to me.

43:35.110 --> 43:36.045
Do as you're told.

43:37.914 --> 43:39.917
Or I'll cut your pregnant wife's
throat.

43:43.420 --> 43:44.954
Don't forget why you're here.

43:46.922 --> 43:47.790
Boy!

43:49.893 --> 43:51.028
Send word to my cousin.

43:51.994 --> 43:53.260
Tell him I have Robin Hood
cornered.

43:53.262 --> 43:54.929
He's about to release
the whore, go quickly.

43:54.931 --> 43:56.264
Wait.

43:56.266 --> 43:57.134
I'll go.

43:58.034 --> 43:59.900
The air down here is foul.

43:59.902 --> 44:00.903
As you wish, sire.

44:15.284 --> 44:16.819
Is this a joke?

44:23.960 --> 44:24.827
Find them.

44:26.730 --> 44:28.197
Get the extra men if you have
to.

44:29.965 --> 44:31.766
Robin Hood has been cornered.

44:31.768 --> 44:33.436
Guy has him locked in the upper
armoury.

44:38.108 --> 44:41.445
Well I guess that's something
at least.

44:42.811 --> 44:43.846
Get Brimstone.

44:45.849 --> 44:47.749
He'll not fail me.

44:47.751 --> 44:48.419
Brimstone?

44:51.153 --> 44:53.157
I think we need a man that
will

44:54.891 --> 44:57.090
obey every command without
question.

45:01.030 --> 45:02.800
Whilst we're busy with Robin
Hood,

45:04.800 --> 45:07.034
I think we need someone
capable of taking care of

45:07.036 --> 45:08.105
this little hiccup!

45:16.146 --> 45:18.949
That useless woman won't get
far.

45:24.954 --> 45:27.454
Tell Brimstone if he kills the
Lady Marian

45:27.456 --> 45:29.326
he won't get any food for a
week.

45:32.195 --> 45:33.731
I want her alive.

46:14.838 --> 46:15.506
What?

46:16.505 --> 46:18.975
The sheriff has a request.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.327
Heave!

46:39.329 --> 46:42.566
It seems my threats
have fallen on deaf ears.

46:46.168 --> 46:47.168
Oh I'm shot!

46:47.170 --> 46:48.038
Archer!

46:49.338 --> 46:50.438
Robin!

46:50.440 --> 46:52.940
May God be with you if these
flames send you to him.

46:52.942 --> 46:55.041
Now quench your swords to stay
in hell.

46:55.043 --> 46:57.181
Burn you bastards, burn!

46:59.081 --> 47:00.615
Burn!

47:08.925 --> 47:12.459
Now we just wait, we hold.

47:12.461 --> 47:15.465
You can be the first one in to
identify the charred corpse.

47:40.389 --> 47:43.423
Little girl, don't be afraid.

47:43.425 --> 47:45.927
Put the sword down, come with
me.

47:45.929 --> 47:47.695
The sheriff wants to see you.

47:54.003 --> 47:55.405
That's enough now!

48:04.981 --> 48:06.984
Come on, she's childish!

48:28.338 --> 48:30.037
Come on Much!

48:34.409 --> 48:36.045
Green has given us knowledge.

48:36.746 --> 48:38.211
Do you trust him?

48:39.014 --> 48:39.679
He's no friend of the
sheriff's.

48:39.681 --> 48:40.715
Yet he fights his battles.

48:40.717 --> 48:42.383
Under duress, John.

48:42.385 --> 48:44.418
He said quench your sword to
stay in hell.

48:44.420 --> 48:45.987
He wants us to survive.

48:45.989 --> 48:47.121
How?

48:47.123 --> 48:48.521
He's helped me made a narrow
escape

48:48.523 --> 48:49.557
when we were fighting on the
same side.

48:49.559 --> 48:50.523
This is our way out.

49:14.384 --> 49:15.318
Die, die!

49:21.657 --> 49:22.526
Go on!

49:43.478 --> 49:45.147
I'm sorry, Robin.

49:47.682 --> 49:49.652
I should never have doubted you.

49:54.489 --> 49:55.358
All this time.

49:57.592 --> 50:00.327
I thought you craved the
battlefield

50:00.329 --> 50:02.699
and were leading us into
oblivion.

50:04.634 --> 50:07.635
That was never my intention,
John.

50:07.637 --> 50:10.737
You two share a bond created
only

50:10.739 --> 50:14.410
by surviving the Crusades,
fighting a holy war.

50:18.713 --> 50:19.615
I see these men.

50:23.351 --> 50:26.088
Bent on killing for killing's
sake.

50:32.228 --> 50:33.329
This is all new to me.

50:37.432 --> 50:40.036
Why should such a purpose exist?

50:41.269 --> 50:42.672
Why such darkness?

50:44.507 --> 50:47.443
A tyrant has warped their
belief.

50:50.512 --> 50:52.315
And now we all must suffer.

50:55.184 --> 50:56.749
Until he is stopped.

50:56.751 --> 51:00.724
If those who can fight, don't
fight,

51:05.795 --> 51:08.532
we really have lost, haven't we?

51:22.411 --> 51:23.776
Where's Marian?

51:23.778 --> 51:25.114
Good question.

51:27.550 --> 51:28.615
Something sharp?

51:28.617 --> 51:32.753
Ah, no no no no no no
no no no no don't cousin!

51:32.755 --> 51:37.758
Please, please, please leave
this to me, this to me.

51:37.760 --> 51:38.628
To me.

51:39.494 --> 51:42.632
To me, Robin Hood is dead.

51:45.168 --> 51:46.436
Burnt him alive.

51:52.574 --> 51:53.742
Would you stake your life on
it?

51:56.545 --> 51:58.881
Have you seen the corpse yet?

52:17.233 --> 52:19.803
Should you present any
more false news to me,

52:22.371 --> 52:24.206
I'll slit your throat myself.

52:32.481 --> 52:33.750
Get those injuries seen to.

52:35.885 --> 52:38.188
I don't want you bleeding
on me any longer.

52:48.431 --> 52:50.331
- Arabella?
- What is it?

52:50.333 --> 52:51.831
It's Robin Hood.

52:51.833 --> 52:52.900
Keep dreaming.

52:52.902 --> 52:55.501
Even he would not be
stupid enough to come here.

52:55.503 --> 52:58.371
If you were right and I were
not here,

52:58.373 --> 53:01.377
then she would be showing
the first signs of madness

53:03.778 --> 53:06.349
and perhaps a scullion
could not even be trusted

53:07.382 --> 53:08.717
with the smallest of knives.

53:13.588 --> 53:14.554
- Ah ah ah.
- Let go!

53:14.556 --> 53:15.424
No need to run.

53:16.224 --> 53:18.258
Nothing but thieves,
marauders!

53:18.260 --> 53:20.594
Get off me, get off me!

53:20.596 --> 53:21.862
Calm yourself, woman!

53:21.864 --> 53:23.496
Can you help us?

53:23.498 --> 53:25.365
Don't trust them, Millicent.

53:25.367 --> 53:26.235
Help, help!

53:26.969 --> 53:28.304
Keep your voice down.

53:37.746 --> 53:38.878
Sorry.

53:38.880 --> 53:40.981
We need access to the dungeons.

53:40.983 --> 53:42.318
I can take you there.

53:44.487 --> 53:46.320
Can we trust anyone here,
Robin?

53:48.858 --> 53:50.227
My friend has a point.

53:51.059 --> 53:53.693
How do we know that we can trust
you?

53:53.695 --> 53:56.296
Your men saved my family.

53:56.298 --> 53:58.501
They gave them grain
when they were starving.

53:59.802 --> 54:01.302
Some say that I'm just a thief

54:01.304 --> 54:02.970
who thought only for himself.

54:02.972 --> 54:05.639
That only beggars and outlaws
benefit from our crimes

54:05.641 --> 54:08.309
and our actions put all others
in danger.

54:08.311 --> 54:09.642
I believe that they would be
dead

54:09.644 --> 54:10.947
were it not for you, Robin.

54:14.349 --> 54:16.583
I'll take you via the west wing
armoury

54:16.585 --> 54:17.853
and direct you from there.

54:19.355 --> 54:22.291
Should I be caught, the
sheriff will kill me.

54:23.092 --> 54:25.695
We will maintain that
you did this under duress.

54:26.829 --> 54:28.095
Be not alarmed.

54:36.005 --> 54:37.273
Lead the way.

54:49.885 --> 54:50.754
Nobody here.

54:53.655 --> 54:54.891
Send word to the sheriff.

54:56.692 --> 54:58.295
Robin Hood is still alive.

55:03.666 --> 55:04.534
Wait.

55:17.012 --> 55:17.881
Come with me.

55:19.481 --> 55:21.650
I need someone to tend
to this wound properly.

55:30.960 --> 55:31.659
Where are they?

55:31.661 --> 55:32.825
Did you not pass Lady Marian?

55:32.827 --> 55:34.630
Obviously not, you moron.

55:36.465 --> 55:38.798
If Hood is alive he'll
be looking for the cells.

55:38.800 --> 55:41.503
If we wait for them there
this will be over soon enough.

55:53.181 --> 55:56.115
Is there no peaceful
solution to this situation?

55:56.117 --> 55:57.885
I wish that were the case.

55:57.887 --> 56:00.789
We take from the sheriff
only what he takes from others.

56:04.860 --> 56:06.396
His only desire is power

56:07.862 --> 56:10.030
and his actions are not
for the good of the people.

56:10.032 --> 56:12.001
But what about
the souls caught in the middle?

56:14.804 --> 56:16.405
They must fight.

56:40.596 --> 56:41.931
How did he die?

56:43.465 --> 56:45.434
My David, he was with you this
morning.

56:47.101 --> 56:49.802
Robin Hood stabbed him
in the back like a coward

56:49.804 --> 56:51.007
- and gutted him.
- No.

56:53.876 --> 56:56.179
Oh, really, shh, shh, shh.

57:02.184 --> 57:04.053
I'm sorry about David.

57:09.757 --> 57:12.895
Savages haven't pushed us out,
no way.

57:13.795 --> 57:15.197
There's no escape.

57:20.568 --> 57:25.574
I'm resilient.

57:28.844 --> 57:30.447
He was a good man.

57:33.516 --> 57:35.782
He was a good man.

57:37.887 --> 57:40.887
Obviously, if he'd been a
better man

57:40.889 --> 57:42.125
he'd still be alive.

57:44.760 --> 57:49.061
And he'd still have a beating
heart.

57:49.063 --> 57:49.932
Yes.

57:53.969 --> 57:58.974
Maybe what you need
is a man more like me.

58:36.778 --> 58:38.211
Much!

58:38.213 --> 58:39.211
Ah!

58:39.213 --> 58:40.583
Stay where you are.

58:43.251 --> 58:46.052
Shouldn't you be with my cousin
by now?

58:46.054 --> 58:48.621
Loosen your grip or he'll
suffocate.

58:48.623 --> 58:51.124
It's no more than the boy
deserves.

58:51.126 --> 58:53.129
Should have been drowned at
birth.

58:54.597 --> 58:55.698
I will kill you.

58:56.699 --> 58:58.865
Your thief couldn't,
so what makes you think

58:58.867 --> 59:01.771
that you could succeed
where he failed, hmm?

59:05.974 --> 59:07.844
I killed him in the armoury.

59:13.983 --> 59:15.652
I don't believe you.

59:19.021 --> 59:21.858
An ill-fated rescue
attempt gone badly wrong.

59:23.925 --> 59:25.291
Burnt to a cinder.

59:25.293 --> 59:26.161
Ah.

59:28.063 --> 59:30.863
See my cousin, he likes to play
games.

59:30.865 --> 59:32.668
But he underestimates your will.

59:34.369 --> 59:35.971
Will to survive.

59:37.271 --> 59:38.875
He's shown you mercy.

59:40.643 --> 59:43.713
Because of his misguided
desire to marry you.

59:45.414 --> 59:47.150
But I won't make the same
mistake.

59:49.251 --> 59:51.187
You and your cousin are
cowards.

59:52.153 --> 59:53.822
You send good men to die.

59:55.257 --> 59:58.161
To fight battles while you bark
orders.

01:00:00.929 --> 01:00:02.865
Treating people like slaves.

01:00:07.969 --> 01:00:08.903
We should stay and fight!

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:11.104
If Robin is here we need to
find him!

01:00:11.106 --> 01:00:11.975
Come on!

01:00:15.443 --> 01:00:16.311
Stop.

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:20.850
How well do you know this
layout?

01:00:21.983 --> 01:00:23.916
The stronghold is built
on top of the old caverns

01:00:23.918 --> 01:00:26.887
which now make up the dungeons
and cells.

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:30.356
Water flowing through the
lowest chambers feeds the moat.

01:00:30.358 --> 01:00:31.425
I used to explore as a child

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:34.097
but we were warned of the
dangers of loose rocks.

01:00:37.132 --> 01:00:39.833
Main cells are that way, but
there are more routes here

01:00:39.835 --> 01:00:41.034
so we must be careful.

01:00:41.036 --> 01:00:43.737
- We'll cover this passageway.
- Better we stay together.

01:00:43.739 --> 01:00:45.037
No.

01:00:45.039 --> 01:00:46.139
We may cover more ground this
way.

01:00:46.141 --> 01:00:47.677
We'll meet back here shortly.

01:00:48.777 --> 01:00:50.179
Millicent with me.

01:00:56.751 --> 01:00:57.420
Here.

01:01:01.155 --> 01:01:02.856
Take this.

01:01:02.858 --> 01:01:04.057
I cannot fight.

01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:04.994
You are one of us now.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.996
The rebellion takes
the fight to the enemy.

01:01:09.965 --> 01:01:11.798
They will without a thought

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.999
kill anyone who stands by me.

01:01:14.001 --> 01:01:15.904
So take up arms or be
defenceless.

01:01:17.371 --> 01:01:19.007
I choose not to fight, Robin.

01:01:21.275 --> 01:01:24.344
The sheriff will show you no
mercy.

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:29.918
Robin.

01:01:59.815 --> 01:02:01.514
She was innocent!

01:02:01.516 --> 01:02:03.219
I did not put her in this
position.

01:02:04.219 --> 01:02:05.088
You did.

01:02:06.054 --> 01:02:07.155
Get close.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.128
Ah.

01:02:14.362 --> 01:02:15.327
Just in time.

01:02:15.329 --> 01:02:16.996
Will!

01:02:16.998 --> 01:02:18.067
John!

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:23.405
Will!

01:02:24.438 --> 01:02:25.304
John!

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:27.375
Did you hear something?

01:02:29.344 --> 01:02:32.012
Maybe Robin's found her.

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:32.882
Maybe not.

01:02:36.451 --> 01:02:37.987
Put down your weapons now.

01:02:40.322 --> 01:02:41.324
Or you're both dead.

01:02:46.862 --> 01:02:47.997
On your knees.

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:17.160
You're next.

01:03:21.295 --> 01:03:24.030
You think in your arrogance
you can invade my stronghold

01:03:24.032 --> 01:03:25.865
and take all my best?

01:03:28.436 --> 01:03:29.570
You're just a selfish thief.

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:32.942
I pity any who believe you
can think beyond yourself.

01:03:38.914 --> 01:03:41.918
What can you do to save them,
Robin?

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:47.889
Ah ah ah ah ah.

01:03:50.157 --> 01:03:53.325
I guard the republic!

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.938
Your friends can't help you,
Robin.

01:04:11.112 --> 01:04:13.679
If Lady Marian doesn't agree to
my terms,

01:04:13.681 --> 01:04:15.450
I'll simply slit her throat.

01:05:08.103 --> 01:05:09.038
Good riddance.

01:05:16.744 --> 01:05:17.612
Take them.

01:05:20.581 --> 01:05:24.420
We'll find out just how many
rebels choose to oppose me.

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.460
You should have been there by
now.

01:05:33.561 --> 01:05:34.931
Come on, get a move on!

01:05:46.641 --> 01:05:47.510
Shh.

01:06:04.693 --> 01:06:06.662
That way, Much, come on.

01:06:12.367 --> 01:06:16.469
Okay Marian, let's go.

01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:47.566
I've just seen the outlaws.

01:06:47.568 --> 01:06:49.269
I want you to go tell the
steward

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:51.470
they're headed for the barbican.

01:06:51.472 --> 01:06:52.340
Go, now!

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:19.132
Die, Robin Hood.

01:08:30.404 --> 01:08:33.205
The Lady Marian is ours.

01:08:33.207 --> 01:08:36.344
And you, Robin Hood, have no way
back.

01:08:57.298 --> 01:08:59.464
If you believe what you say,

01:08:59.466 --> 01:09:01.867
if what you say is true about my
friends,

01:09:01.868 --> 01:09:03.837
then you have given me nothing
to lose.

01:09:04.837 --> 01:09:05.875
You are all blinded!

01:09:07.274 --> 01:09:09.478
By greed and glory.

01:09:11.613 --> 01:09:12.481
That's death.

01:09:15.884 --> 01:09:16.752
Coward.

01:09:28.962 --> 01:09:30.365
Robin Hood is dead.

01:09:32.832 --> 01:09:36.902
It's just a matter of time
before your beloved Marian

01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:39.274
and her rat boy are recaptured.

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:45.314
The rebellion is over.

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:48.013
Sire, sire.

01:09:48.015 --> 01:09:49.314
Do tell.

01:09:49.317 --> 01:09:50.883
We found the Lady Marian.

01:09:50.885 --> 01:09:53.288
They made it to the barbican.

01:09:58.326 --> 01:09:59.992
The barbican.

01:09:59.994 --> 01:10:00.930
Yes sire.

01:10:14.609 --> 01:10:15.477
Cousin.

01:10:20.681 --> 01:10:21.884
Cousin.

01:10:23.585 --> 01:10:25.820
No one is to touch
these two until I return.

01:10:27.689 --> 01:10:29.758
Do I make myself clear?

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:42.238
Gather some other guards.

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:51.343
Stop.

01:10:51.345 --> 01:10:52.013
What is it?

01:10:53.448 --> 01:10:56.348
Robin's here.

01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:59.552
He'll be looking for us.

01:10:59.554 --> 01:11:01.787
We can't go back the way we
came.

01:11:05.426 --> 01:11:06.261
God's head.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:08.394
There's too many.

01:11:08.396 --> 01:11:11.430
I can't go any further, I need
to rest.

01:11:11.432 --> 01:11:14.967
If we had a rope we could
climb down to the next level.

01:11:14.969 --> 01:11:17.437
And go back from there.

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:20.740
We passed another doorway back
there.

01:11:20.742 --> 01:11:21.907
Wait here.

01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:30.519
Don't move.

01:11:33.787 --> 01:11:35.423
You people have done enough.

01:11:38.693 --> 01:11:41.626
- Please.
- Please what?

01:11:41.628 --> 01:11:42.961
Please don't stop you?

01:11:42.963 --> 01:11:44.964
I mean you no harm.

01:11:44.966 --> 01:11:46.132
Then you should have
stayed in the dungeon

01:11:46.134 --> 01:11:48.601
and met with your punishment.

01:11:48.603 --> 01:11:49.468
I just need this rope!

01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:50.605
It's not yours to take!

01:11:57.011 --> 01:11:58.781
Step out of my way.

01:12:03.851 --> 01:12:05.085
Those within the stronghold
walls

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:08.757
do not understand the rule of
fear and terror beyond them.

01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:13.159
The sheriff is your enemy, not
me.

01:12:13.161 --> 01:12:16.597
He simply tries to bring
order to the savagery,

01:12:17.832 --> 01:12:20.069
chaos caused by people like you.

01:12:21.101 --> 01:12:23.671
People like me stand up to
him.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.540
Fight for what we believe in.

01:12:28.542 --> 01:12:31.913
He's a good man who provides
for all within these walls.

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:35.951
You let him rule those you
care for.

01:12:37.752 --> 01:12:42.423
Send them to die for a
fight that's not their own.

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:45.493
Are you willing to die for
your fight?

01:12:47.662 --> 01:12:48.530
Yes.

01:12:50.497 --> 01:12:52.500
The sheriff's
men will be here any minute.

01:12:55.203 --> 01:12:56.772
Not a moment to lose, then.

01:13:19.793 --> 01:13:20.660
No!

01:13:25.867 --> 01:13:28.067
No hide and seek.

01:13:34.775 --> 01:13:35.644
Just to be sure.

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:52.594
I've lost my patience.

01:13:53.528 --> 01:13:56.728
We've captured your little band
of rebels.

01:14:09.577 --> 01:14:10.813
I'm not going to kill you.

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:15.716
I'm just going to humiliate you.

01:14:17.018 --> 01:14:18.086
Killing is easy.

01:14:20.988 --> 01:14:22.523
I've killed your Robin Hood.

01:14:27.028 --> 01:14:28.628
But now we're free to take the
bonds

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:31.033
of holy matrimony without
complication.

01:14:33.201 --> 01:14:33.868
Come on!

01:14:43.711 --> 01:14:44.947
What's down there?

01:14:47.582 --> 01:14:49.048
Looking for your dignity?

01:14:50.618 --> 01:14:52.020
We have business to attend to.

01:15:07.167 --> 01:15:09.505
- Belief.
- Who goes there?

01:15:11.338 --> 01:15:13.942
This is belief.

01:15:17.278 --> 01:15:18.710
Show yourself.

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:33.929
Friar.

01:15:36.264 --> 01:15:38.365
Correct, Robin Hood.

01:15:42.235 --> 01:15:44.003
How did you know it was me?

01:15:44.005 --> 01:15:46.839
The lord has chosen to take my
sight,

01:15:46.841 --> 01:15:49.208
but not my wits, Robin.

01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:54.245
I overheard your quarrel with
the brute.

01:15:54.247 --> 01:15:59.253
I believe his exact words
were "Die, Robin Hood."

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:01.789
Indeed they were.

01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:05.124
You see what these men do?

01:16:05.126 --> 01:16:06.994
Serving what they believe?

01:16:08.328 --> 01:16:13.335
Your belief became strength
in your darkest hour.

01:16:14.668 --> 01:16:19.273
Believed that you had nothing
to lose and all was lost.

01:16:21.042 --> 01:16:23.779
But you defeated the devil.

01:16:25.779 --> 01:16:28.013
He was not the devil, just a
man.

01:16:28.015 --> 01:16:30.719
Not a man, Robin Hood.

01:16:31.819 --> 01:16:36.254
Your fear is the devil's work.

01:16:36.256 --> 01:16:41.062
Now you must show him
you do not fight for hate

01:16:42.063 --> 01:16:43.928
or vengeance.

01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:45.333
I fight to survive.

01:16:47.801 --> 01:16:52.170
Fight now not just for
yourself, but for others

01:16:52.172 --> 01:16:53.341
and a greater cause.

01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:58.045
My friends are all dead now,
Friar.

01:16:59.447 --> 01:17:01.746
You don't know that, Robin.

01:17:01.748 --> 01:17:03.751
And I suspect you don't believe
it.

01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:18.800
No one dare venture here.

01:17:19.867 --> 01:17:23.238
I often come here to collect my
thoughts.

01:17:24.238 --> 01:17:29.244
It seems that a blind old friar
is nothing to bother about

01:17:29.444 --> 01:17:32.247
so I roam free.

01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:35.714
You are not to be
underestimated.

01:17:35.716 --> 01:17:38.416
That we have in common.

01:17:38.418 --> 01:17:42.455
This is a very good place
for hiding things of value,

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:46.125
things that would be
wasted in the wrong hands,

01:17:46.127 --> 01:17:48.427
including my best mead.

01:17:52.265 --> 01:17:57.238
You will make better use of
this than I will, take it.

01:17:59.439 --> 01:18:00.307
Yes.

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:08.880
Picture the ones you love.

01:18:08.882 --> 01:18:11.383
See them in your mind's eye,

01:18:11.385 --> 01:18:15.254
and fight for them, fight for
something

01:18:15.256 --> 01:18:17.022
greater than yourself.

01:18:17.024 --> 01:18:19.428
And you will be unstoppable.

01:18:24.532 --> 01:18:25.701
Thank you, Friar.

01:18:26.533 --> 01:18:28.269
Godspeed, godspeed.

01:18:29.369 --> 01:18:31.504
I'll explain the way out.

01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:36.712
When you ascend the ladder,
this is what you must do.

01:18:42.283 --> 01:18:46.855
Our father, who art in
heaven, hallowed by thy name.

01:18:50.257 --> 01:18:52.991
Thy kingdom come, thy will be
done,

01:18:52.993 --> 01:18:55.827
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:18:55.829 --> 01:18:59.197
Give us this day our daily bread

01:18:59.199 --> 01:19:01.467
and forgive us our trespasses

01:19:01.469 --> 01:19:05.340
as we forgive those that
trespass against us.

01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:09.040
And lead us not into temptation

01:19:09.042 --> 01:19:11.442
but deliver us from evil,

01:19:11.444 --> 01:19:16.514
for thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory,

01:19:16.516 --> 01:19:18.052
forever and ever.

01:19:21.255 --> 01:19:22.123
Amen.

01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:28.126
What's happening?

01:19:28.128 --> 01:19:30.428
Robin Hood, the lower
levels.

01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:31.500
Impossible.

01:19:35.302 --> 01:19:36.137
You.

01:19:37.104 --> 01:19:40.274
You stay here, make sure
nobody touches them.

01:19:41.408 --> 01:19:42.607
I have to be the one to tell my
cousin,

01:19:42.609 --> 01:19:44.108
I wanna see the look on his face

01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:46.113
- when he realises he's failed.
- Sire.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.513
Robin Hood is cunning.

01:19:48.515 --> 01:19:50.351
Should you encounter him on the
way,

01:19:51.886 --> 01:19:53.419
then considering your injuries

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.321
I should perhaps accompany you.

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:57.022
If only to see you
deliver the coup de gras

01:19:57.024 --> 01:19:59.391
he so richly deserves.

01:20:16.277 --> 01:20:17.442
- My good man.
- What?

01:20:28.288 --> 01:20:29.157
John!

01:20:46.373 --> 01:20:48.844
Come, we must find Marian.

01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:52.413
I'm fine, by the way.

01:21:13.434 --> 01:21:15.971
There is a way to end this.

01:21:17.203 --> 01:21:19.139
No one else has to die.

01:21:20.274 --> 01:21:22.010
We can unite the people.

01:21:25.246 --> 01:21:26.581
Robin Hood is dead.

01:21:28.282 --> 01:21:29.918
I've done what I set out to do.

01:21:31.118 --> 01:21:32.384
I've brought you here, I've
trapped

01:21:32.386 --> 01:21:33.955
and conquered my enemy.

01:21:35.456 --> 01:21:39.994
And next, I'm going to hunt down
and kill

01:21:42.363 --> 01:21:44.097
every single one of your
outlaws.

01:21:48.168 --> 01:21:49.371
So I ask you again,

01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:55.243
save the people.

01:21:59.579 --> 01:22:00.448
Marry me.

01:22:03.384 --> 01:22:04.252
No.

01:22:10.123 --> 01:22:10.992
Cousin.

01:22:13.394 --> 01:22:14.930
Robin Hood lives.

01:22:21.735 --> 01:22:22.604
Get off!

01:22:24.637 --> 01:22:27.175
Will you watch me kill him?

01:22:38.118 --> 01:22:40.552
How we gonna find her now?

01:22:40.554 --> 01:22:41.623
That's how.

01:22:47.293 --> 01:22:52.300
Where are they now, Hood?

01:22:52.565 --> 01:22:56.268
Go and get the other
guards immediately, go now!

01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:04.809
Kill them all!

01:23:04.811 --> 01:23:05.680
He's mine!

01:23:10.818 --> 01:23:11.686
Savage.

01:23:18.591 --> 01:23:20.027
This is the end.

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:09.474
Do you think yourself immortal,

01:24:09.476 --> 01:24:10.345
or blind?

01:24:13.314 --> 01:24:16.647
Those archers will kill on
command.

01:24:16.649 --> 01:24:19.219
They will release on
command but they may miss.

01:24:20.154 --> 01:24:21.423
Their arm's already tired.

01:24:22.389 --> 01:24:23.725
Their grip loose.

01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:51.418
The will to survive.

01:24:58.525 --> 01:24:59.525
Fire!

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:00.526
Robin!

01:25:00.528 --> 01:25:01.393
Watch out!

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:40.435
Green.

01:25:41.902 --> 01:25:44.139
Should I be pleased to see you
this time?

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:49.210
Tell your men the sheriff is
dead, the rebellion is over.

01:25:50.877 --> 01:25:52.212
They answer to you now.

01:25:53.747 --> 01:25:55.416
You survive once again, Robin.

01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:58.186
Thanks in part to you, old
friend.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:00.889
You look a mess.

01:26:03.856 --> 01:26:04.725
Thanks.

01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:16.401
I told them
not to underestimate you.

01:26:16.403 --> 01:26:18.673
Well it seems they
didn't take your advice.

01:26:19.539 --> 01:26:20.805
What now?

01:26:20.807 --> 01:26:23.845
Well now we return to mourn
the loss of our young friend.

01:26:26.279 --> 01:26:27.481
And to recover.

01:26:28.849 --> 01:26:30.882
But we shall return.

01:26:30.884 --> 01:26:33.619
We must give back all that
the sheriff has taken.

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:35.320
The king will hear of this.

01:26:35.322 --> 01:26:36.324
As well he should.

01:26:37.257 --> 01:26:38.693
I only answer to the true king.

01:26:40.661 --> 01:26:42.529
Should he ever return.

01:26:44.297 --> 01:26:45.632
I'll send word if he does.

01:27:24.704 --> 01:27:25.640
Why Much?

01:27:27.841 --> 01:27:31.279
He fought and died
for what he believed in.

01:27:35.448 --> 01:27:37.081
And we should be celebrating his
life

01:27:37.083 --> 01:27:38.685
and now dwelling on his death.

01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:42.053
To live on in our memory.

01:27:42.055 --> 01:27:44.658
Robin, there are still
many things to attend to.

01:27:46.493 --> 01:27:47.528
Perhaps our work can wait.

01:27:50.530 --> 01:27:54.269
Let us rest until our
energy returns, do you mind?

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:58.472
Thank you.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:00.708
Don't thank me.

01:28:02.009 --> 01:28:03.578
We would have left you there.
