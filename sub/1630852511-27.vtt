like, scared for her life.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.834

Nikki, let's go.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.001

10:02.001 --> 10:04.070

was like, eh.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.972
- Yeah, then look!
- All right. Well, say sorry.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.541

I didn't know it was wine.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.476

It's [bleep] red.

10:10.476 --> 10:11.744

It's [bleep] red.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.015

- Because that's the only thing

I thought it was
a water bottle.

how to wash a [bleep] dish.

10:38.838 --> 10:39.972
- Vinny, you're an asshole,
though.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.541
Really, for real.
- Come on.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.476
- So dumb.
- Come on, come on.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.211
- That didn't even make sense.
- No, it didn't make sense.

10:45.211 --> 10:47.146

getting mad because you--you--

10:47.146 --> 10:49.148
you were backing out
posting a [bleep] post.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.117
You posted it anyway.
- She's crazy.

10:51.117 --> 10:52.251
- Either way,
you don't come out

10:52.251 --> 10:53.920

on people.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.422

11:49.809 --> 11:52.044

11:52.044 --> 11:54.947
She took it upon herself
to, now, take a water bottle

11:54.947 --> 11:57.183
and douse it my face.

11:57.183 --> 12:02.188
So why did Nikki now get up
and waterboarded me?

12:02.188 --> 12:03.956
<i>I'm covered and drenched.</i>

12:03.956 --> 12:06.859
Like, I had [bleep] water
coming out of my nostrils.

12:06.859 --> 12:09.695
And then I, in return,
whatever I could grab,

12:09.695 --> 12:10.963
I just chucked it.

12:10.963 --> 12:13.232
I did not know
it was [bleep] wine.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.634

12:14.634 --> 12:15.768

on somebody.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.036
It's crazy--
- Look at my shorts.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.271
- I know.
You ruined somebody's outfit.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.539
That's crazy.

What was that for?

12:30.016 --> 12:31.350

We'll take it to dry cleaning.

12:31.350 --> 12:32.952
This is very on-brand

12:41.961 --> 12:43.396
to a frigging water fight.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.563
[chuckles] Crazy.

12:44.563 --> 12:45.931
- Nikki had nothing
to do with it.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.800
I had no problems with her
in this whole situation.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.504
But [bleep], she took
a whole water bottle, goes--

12:51.504 --> 12:54.040
Are you [bleep] kidding me?
Are you serious?

12:54.040 --> 12:56.042
She was in the mix.
I had nothing to do with it.

the day, like, it is--

12:57.910 --> 12:59.679
like, it's--everyone's
all amped up right now.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.514
It's just clothes.
Like--

13:01.514 --> 13:03.516
- Why did she throw water
in my face like that?

13:03.516 --> 13:06.452
- Because you threw water.
She got wet.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.354
So her reaction--
- OK, how wet did she get?

13:08.354 --> 13:09.655
- It don't--it don't matter,

13:09.655 --> 13:10.790
like, if she got a little wet
or a lot of wet.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.692
Her reaction was
to get you wet.

13:12.692 --> 13:15.061
- I didn't even mean to
throw the water at her.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.762
I swear to God.

13:16.762 --> 13:20.199
I did not mean to throw
the water on my--on her.

13:20.199 --> 13:21.967
- I know you didn't, Ang.
- I swear.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.369
- I know you didn't.

13:23.369 --> 13:24.770
Angelina, you know,

13:24.770 --> 13:26.706

in her life.

And her emotions are
super high right now,

<i>just very like riled up,</i>

13:34.580 --> 13:36.549

all over the place.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.284
- I'm going through
a [bleep] divorce.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.252
I'm going through
my own [bleep].

13:40.252 --> 13:43.723
I am so hurting inside.
I'm struggling.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.191
- You don't seem all right.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.760
- I'm going through
a lot of [bleep] stress.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.961
It's hard.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.696

13:50.696 --> 13:53.265
like, I lost my [bleep] person.

13:53.265 --> 13:57.136
Like, I'm still going through
a [bleep] break-up.

13:57.136 --> 14:01.040
This is why it's very hard
for me on this trip

14:01.040 --> 14:03.843
to not have that person
that's with me.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.445
<i>You know, everybody's
got their other person,</i>

14:06.445 --> 14:08.514
while I'm ultimately
alone in this.

14:08.514 --> 14:13.986
I can't keep doing
this anymore.

14:13.986 --> 14:16.989
I can't.

14:16.989 --> 14:20.526
I can't do it.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.762
I want to go home.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.465

14:26.465 --> 14:28.968
I felt like I've been there.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.035
I've been there.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.838

my own battles every day.

14:53.584 --> 14:55.185
- Angelina, you know,

14:55.185 --> 14:57.054
she has a lot going on
in her life.

14:57.054 --> 14:58.689
<i>♪ ♪</i>

14:58.689 --> 15:00.124
I just hope
she's gonna be all right,

15:00.124 --> 15:01.825
especially after this mess.

15:01.825 --> 15:03.727
I know. This was a lot.

15:03.727 --> 15:05.129
I didn't want you
to be by yourself.

15:05.129 --> 15:06.330
- Thank you.
- Because--

15:06.330 --> 15:07.898
- You guys like,
really my true friends.

15:07.898 --> 15:10.434
- You didn't have--
you don't have anybody.

15:10.434 --> 15:13.370
At least, everybody else
has somebody to talk to.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.671
- I seen that [bleep] coming.

15:14.671 --> 15:16.173
I seen it coming.

15:16.173 --> 15:18.709
And I was like, all right,
time to go. Time to get up.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.345
I'm just trying to stay
as far away as I can

15:21.345 --> 15:22.813
when it comes to drama
with Angelina

15:22.813 --> 15:26.049
just because I just know
how messy it can be.

15:26.049 --> 15:28.018
Do you see how messy this is?

15:28.018 --> 15:29.286
- It's not messy on my behalf.

15:29.286 --> 15:31.121
- You gotta be
[bleep] kidding me.

15:31.121 --> 15:33.157
Do you see what
a dumpster fire this is?

15:33.157 --> 15:34.425
- Shut up, Mike.

15:34.425 --> 15:36.894
- I felt like the [bleep] fire
behind the

15:36.894 --> 15:38.162
throwing of the water.
- Yeah.

15:38.162 --> 15:39.530
I definitely think that,

15:39.530 --> 15:41.331
with everything that's going on
with Angelina,

15:41.331 --> 15:42.733
things are starting to unravel.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.802
Because throwing red wine
on someone

15:44.802 --> 15:47.604
is not the mark of someone
that's got it together,

15:47.604 --> 15:48.605
to be honest with you.

15:48.605 --> 15:50.107
This is not a good situation.

15:50.107 --> 15:52.543
And then I felt bad because
I saw how upset Pauly was.

15:52.543 --> 15:53.877
- Yeah.

15:53.877 --> 15:55.345
- I don't know how this
is gonna get fixed.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.747
<i>Usually, it takes a long time</i>

15:56.747 --> 15:58.282
<i>for Angelina to take
some accountability.</i>

15:58.282 --> 16:00.050
<i>Usually, it takes a long time
for Angelina</i>

16:00.050 --> 16:02.186
to understand her part
in an argument

16:02.186 --> 16:03.520
or find some common ground.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.255
Sometimes it takes like,
almost a year,

16:05.255 --> 16:06.590
maybe even years
with her sometimes.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.992
I will say that
there will be beef

16:08.992 --> 16:10.727
in the streets tomorrow.
- No.

16:10.727 --> 16:12.262
- I'm telling you.
- You think so?

16:12.262 --> 16:13.597
- There will be beef
in the streets tomorrow.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.898
Hell, yeah.

16:14.898 --> 16:16.333
- All right.
So Pauly's gonna be mad at me

16:16.333 --> 16:18.035
and he doesn't want--every
want to talk to me again.

16:18.035 --> 16:19.570
And she's gonna be mad at me.
OK.

16:19.570 --> 16:21.371
- Yeah, he broke
the [bleep] door down.

16:21.371 --> 16:22.739
- What?
- He broke the door down.

16:22.739 --> 16:23.740
- No, shh.

16:23.740 --> 16:25.409
<i>- I hear Pauly screaming.</i>

16:25.409 --> 16:28.212
It sounded like--
[dramatic roaring]

16:28.212 --> 16:29.613
[cat snarls]

16:29.613 --> 16:32.349
And I'm like,
"Oh, [bleep]. I'm screwed."

16:32.349 --> 16:34.051
Pauly, he's never
involved in drama.

16:34.051 --> 16:35.719
And I don't know how
she's gonna react.

16:35.719 --> 16:36.753
That's my problem.

16:36.753 --> 16:38.155
- You're a little
scared of Pauly?

16:38.155 --> 16:39.423
- Yeah.

16:39.423 --> 16:41.225
I've never seen
Pauly like that before.

16:41.225 --> 16:43.060
And I never want to see him
like that ever again.

16:43.060 --> 16:45.496
I mean I'm [bleep]--
I'm startled.

16:45.496 --> 16:47.197
- But listen, the most
important thing is,

16:47.197 --> 16:50.267
you can't think
about tomorrow right now.

16:50.267 --> 16:52.002
- But you know how
my mind goes, Chris.

16:52.002 --> 16:54.771
- Well, that's--eh.

16:54.771 --> 16:56.540
- I barely have
[bleep] clothes here

16:56.540 --> 16:58.408
and like, you want
to pour [bleep] wine

16:58.408 --> 16:59.910
and then lock yourself
in a room?

16:59.910 --> 17:01.411
- Like, this escalated
to something

17:01.411 --> 17:03.514
that it should not have
ever escalated to.

17:03.514 --> 17:05.549
This could ruin
the rest of this entire trip.

17:05.549 --> 17:07.851
At least, if you're gonna have
a wine fight, stay out for it.

17:07.851 --> 17:09.720
That's why I opened the door.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.256
I was told to always
open a door for a lady.

17:12.256 --> 17:13.724
Everybody know that.

17:13.724 --> 17:15.592
- Opened the door?
You kicked that [bleep] down.

17:15.592 --> 17:18.262
- He's pissed.
He [bleep] broke a door.

17:18.262 --> 17:19.863
- I think he was just
in the moment.

17:19.863 --> 17:21.164
- He was defending his lady.

17:21.164 --> 17:22.933
I honestly--
I would do the same for Deena.

17:22.933 --> 17:25.302
- How is Pauly, me, and Nikki
ever gonna be

17:25.302 --> 17:27.404
in the same [bleep] room again
after this?

17:27.404 --> 17:31.108
- I love you
and I love all of them.

17:31.108 --> 17:32.676
And I feel like
I don't know where--

17:32.676 --> 17:36.013
where this is gonna go.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.215
- I have to go home.
I can't do this anymore.

17:38.215 --> 17:39.583
- I think you just
need a shower.

17:39.583 --> 17:41.451
- I can't keep
doing this anymore.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.586
I can't.

17:42.586 --> 17:44.588
- I think you just
need a shower.

17:45.756 --> 17:48.091
- I can't keep
doing this anymore.

17:48.992 --> 17:52.262
- What if you just shower?
- [sniffles]

17:52.262 --> 17:54.131
I can't. I have to go home.

17:54.131 --> 17:56.066
- I don't know.
I think you need to go to bed.

17:56.066 --> 17:58.402
I think--I think--

17:58.402 --> 18:01.805
I think shower, go to bed.

18:01.805 --> 18:04.207
And maybe tomorrow morning,
everybody talks.

18:04.207 --> 18:05.208
I'm not really sure
where we go--

18:05.208 --> 18:06.510
- I'm gonna go home.

18:06.510 --> 18:08.011
- I think you should go back
to your room.

18:08.011 --> 18:09.346
- Why don't you shower?
- I think you should shower.

18:09.346 --> 18:10.647
- I don't want to shower.
- Listen--listen--

18:10.647 --> 18:12.749
- I need to go home.
- You need to shower.

18:12.749 --> 18:14.151
- Why don't you just shower,

18:14.151 --> 18:15.852
relax a little, and--
- No.

18:15.852 --> 18:17.988
- I think maybe
you just need a shower.

18:17.988 --> 18:19.222
- Deena, I'm done.

18:19.222 --> 18:20.424
- I think you just
need a shower.

18:20.424 --> 18:21.792
- No.
- I think you need a shower--

18:21.792 --> 18:23.760
and you need to go to bed.
- I need to go home.

18:23.760 --> 18:27.297
- Then--then--go to--shower--
- No.

18:27.297 --> 18:29.166
- I think you just need
to go and decompress

18:29.166 --> 18:30.934
in your room, Ang.

18:30.934 --> 18:33.637
Have a shower, if you want.

18:33.637 --> 18:36.006
- No. I'm always
the [bleep] bad guy.

18:36.006 --> 18:37.040
- No one's saying that.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.141
- This is why I have to

18:38.141 --> 18:39.643
take myself out
of the situation,

18:39.643 --> 18:41.144
so I'm no longer the bad guy.

18:41.144 --> 18:42.379
- Oh, God.

18:42.379 --> 18:43.947
- I'm telling you,
I'm not doing this.

18:43.947 --> 18:47.317
This is not gonna play into
some sorry, sorry, sorry, so--

18:47.317 --> 18:48.719
I'm not doing it anymore.

18:48.719 --> 18:50.420
I'm done with sorrys.
- No one's asking you to.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.289
You're thinking
two steps ahead.

18:52.289 --> 18:54.157
<i>- I'm already hurting because
of everything going on.</i>

18:54.157 --> 18:55.592
Didn't make it right
to throw water,

18:55.592 --> 18:57.494
but you know what? I was mad.

18:57.494 --> 18:58.795
Vinny, I had enough of him.

18:58.795 --> 19:01.531
I can't keep doing
this anymore.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.300
- You're spiraling yourself,
Angelina.

19:03.300 --> 19:06.269
- I'm just over it.
I--I need to leave.

19:06.269 --> 19:07.904
I need to go home.

19:11.808 --> 19:13.844
- Am I being pranked?

19:13.844 --> 19:15.278
[chuckles]

19:15.278 --> 19:17.381
- This would be a good prank.

19:18.348 --> 19:20.651
- The fact that Vinny couldn't
just abide by his [bleep].

19:20.651 --> 19:23.220
He had to be a dweeb--

19:23.220 --> 19:24.488
- I wish I was getting
pranked right now.

19:24.488 --> 19:25.922
- Me, too.

19:25.922 --> 19:27.491
- This entire trip,
I've been waiting for a prank

19:27.491 --> 19:30.794
to be, you know, done to me
because of the murder mystery

19:30.794 --> 19:32.162
because everybody was so upset.

19:32.162 --> 19:33.563
- Guys.
- Stop, stop.

19:33.563 --> 19:34.564
- No, no.
What is in there?

19:34.564 --> 19:35.899
No, no, no, no.

19:35.899 --> 19:36.967
- Oh, [bleep].

19:36.967 --> 19:38.568
- What?
- I'm not--

19:38.568 --> 19:40.470
- We need to get a medic.
- Oh, my God.

19:40.470 --> 19:41.872
- No!

19:41.872 --> 19:44.541
Welcome to
Murder Mystery Dinner!

19:44.541 --> 19:45.842
- What?

19:45.842 --> 19:48.612
- So I'm like,
"Is this a prank on me?

19:48.612 --> 19:50.414
Is everybody in on this?"

19:50.414 --> 19:52.416
- She's gonna
feel dumb tomorrow--

19:52.416 --> 19:53.417
I think.

19:53.417 --> 19:55.419
- She was in the crossfire.

19:55.419 --> 19:56.920
- Like, what's happening?

19:56.920 --> 19:58.055
- But, Angelina,
it went from like,

19:58.055 --> 19:59.923
you beefing with Vinny,
to like--

19:59.923 --> 20:02.059
- I was not beefing with Nikki.
- No, it doesn't matter.

20:02.059 --> 20:03.694
- I know.
I'm the bad one again.

20:03.694 --> 20:06.129
It's all my fault.
Everything's my fault.

20:06.129 --> 20:07.664
- Is this the prank?

20:07.664 --> 20:09.099
Am I getting pranked?

20:14.168 --> 20:16.037
<i>- ♪ I got this on lock,
baby, take a seat ♪</i>

20:16.037 --> 20:18.906
<i>♪ You need to cool off,
can't take the heat ♪</i>

20:18.906 --> 20:20.475
- Why would you
even put "joking"?

20:20.475 --> 20:22.176
And then Nikki threw water
in my face

20:22.176 --> 20:23.411
like I was a [bleep] asshole?

20:23.411 --> 20:24.746
What does she have
to do with anything?

20:24.746 --> 20:26.080
I went to throw--
I didn't even throw it at her.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.115
I threw it at him.

20:27.115 --> 20:28.516
- Angelina just keeps saying

20:28.516 --> 20:30.051
<i>the same things over and over.</i>

20:30.051 --> 20:31.786
- Why did she throw water
in my face?

20:31.786 --> 20:33.287
Literally took the whole bottle
and threw it in my face.

20:33.287 --> 20:35.623
Why would she throw a whole
water bottle in my face?

20:35.623 --> 20:36.991
But it's water.

20:36.991 --> 20:38.326
I don't even care about water.

20:38.326 --> 20:39.627
<i>- We're like, "We get it."</i>

20:39.627 --> 20:40.895
- But then I saw a cup there.

20:40.895 --> 20:42.296
I really did think
it was water. I went--

20:42.296 --> 20:43.564
<i>- I feel super bad,</i>

20:43.564 --> 20:45.433
but she just needs
to get in the shower,

20:45.433 --> 20:46.768
cool herself down...

20:46.768 --> 20:48.770
All right.
I think we're gonna go to bed.

20:48.770 --> 20:50.037
Go to sleep,

20:50.037 --> 20:51.506
<i>and hopefully, in the morning,</i>

20:51.506 --> 20:54.075
we'll all be at like,
a better place.

20:54.075 --> 20:55.910
- Go to bed, guys.

20:55.910 --> 20:58.446
- You're all right.
I think you just need a shower.

20:58.446 --> 21:01.549
You need a shower and you
need to like, decompress.

21:01.549 --> 21:03.551
You know, Angelina
has been on the edge

21:03.551 --> 21:06.187
with the divorce
and all this stuff going on,

21:06.187 --> 21:08.222
you know, like, everything.

21:08.222 --> 21:09.857
So I just hope
she's gonna be all right,

21:09.857 --> 21:11.526
<i>especially after this mess.</i>

21:11.526 --> 21:13.661
<i>But at the same time,
I still don't know</i>

21:13.661 --> 21:15.096
if this was a prank or not.

21:15.096 --> 21:17.098
I have no idea
if I'm being pranked.

21:17.098 --> 21:18.933
What the [bleep]?

21:18.933 --> 21:20.501
That was crazy.

21:20.501 --> 21:23.004
- Should we check on Vin?
- Yeah, I guess.

21:25.306 --> 21:26.908
I just wish this
never happened,

21:26.908 --> 21:28.676
'cause it was finally
going great,

21:28.676 --> 21:30.278
everybody was in
a good headspace.

21:30.278 --> 21:31.879
<i>We had such a good night.</i>

21:31.879 --> 21:34.015
And now, here we are again,

21:34.015 --> 21:36.918
in a dramatic frickin' mess.

21:36.918 --> 21:39.420
Well, that was
a [bleep] disaster.

21:39.420 --> 21:40.655
- Yeah.

21:40.655 --> 21:42.323
- Angelina is in there
right now like,

21:42.323 --> 21:43.658
acting like
she killed somebody.

21:43.658 --> 21:45.159
<i>- As Angelina drinks,</i>

21:45.159 --> 21:47.595
I feel like all of her
inner stresses come out

21:47.595 --> 21:49.163
and she starts fighting with
everybody.

21:49.163 --> 21:51.466
You know,
Angelina kinda just, like,

21:51.466 --> 21:52.967
messed with the wrong one
tonight.

21:52.967 --> 21:54.869
- How much wine did
she actually throw at me?

21:54.869 --> 21:57.271
Like, that's like
the actual whole bottle.

21:57.271 --> 21:58.539
I just recognized that.

21:58.539 --> 22:00.641
- You know, Nikki got caught
in the crosshair

22:00.641 --> 22:02.977

the bet.

22:30.004 --> 22:31.339

22:40.848 --> 22:42.450

pieces, a divorce right now.

22:47.421 --> 22:49.624

22:51.526 --> 22:52.760

23:31.065 --> 23:32.633

23:58.192 --> 23:59.694

23:59.694 --> 24:01.362

Babe, but how's your shoulder?

29:33.329 --> 29:34.764
- I just opened the door.
Why?

29:34.764 --> 29:37.233
- [laughing]

29:37.233 --> 29:39.702
- I hard rocked the door
at Hard Rock.

29:39.702 --> 29:40.803
- Hi.

29:40.803 --> 29:42.805
- Hi.
- How are you feeling?

29:42.805 --> 29:44.407
- Come on in, girl.

29:44.407 --> 29:46.543
It wasn't an emergency like--
- Oh, thank God.

29:46.543 --> 29:47.677
- Like an appendix removal.

29:47.677 --> 29:49.212
- Can you still drink?

29:49.212 --> 29:51.214
[laughing]
- No.

29:51.214 --> 29:52.448
He thought I tore my abdomen.

29:52.448 --> 29:54.150
- I would have taken
an abdomen tear.

29:54.150 --> 29:56.152
- Oh, no.
Wait--what happened?

29:56.152 --> 29:57.153
- What happened?

29:57.153 --> 29:58.221
We went to Wild 'N Out,

29:58.221 --> 30:00.123
like, Nick Cannon's restaurant.

30:00.123 --> 30:01.958
And Nick Cannon and
Justina were there.

30:01.958 --> 30:03.993
- Redhead Justina?
- Yeah.

30:03.993 --> 30:06.062
You would have died,
because we played Wild 'N Out.

30:06.062 --> 30:08.031
If the girls won,

30:08.031 --> 30:11.968
Vinny had to do an appreciation
post for Angelina.

30:11.968 --> 30:13.937
So he did appreciation story.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.539
All of a sudden, he deletes
the story, and he puts "JK."

30:16.539 --> 30:18.007
So she gets a water bottle,

30:18.007 --> 30:19.609
throws water on Vinny.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.244
Nikki got a little water
on her--

30:21.244 --> 30:23.212
- Was she upset?
- Oh, pissed.

30:23.212 --> 30:26.282
So then she got up and she gets
a full bottle of water.

30:26.282 --> 30:28.918
And she pours it
all over Angelina.

30:28.918 --> 30:30.787
- What?

30:32.522 --> 30:34.691
- Well--
- The aftermath.

30:36.025 --> 30:37.360
- Oh, we're going to do it.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.528
Holy [bleep].

30:38.528 --> 30:40.363
- Oh, my God.
It's like a crime scene.

30:40.363 --> 30:41.531
- What a waste of wine.

30:41.531 --> 30:44.334
- What the [bleep]?
- Whoa.

30:44.334 --> 30:45.568
- Now Angelina's pissed.

30:45.568 --> 30:48.137
Now she threw a wine at Nikki.

30:48.137 --> 30:50.640
Angelina throws herself
in the confessional

30:50.640 --> 30:51.808
and locks the door.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.543
Pauly then breaks the door.

30:53.543 --> 30:54.844
- What?

30:54.844 --> 30:57.146
- Man, look what you
did to this door, man.

30:57.146 --> 30:58.314
- Stinks of wine.

30:58.314 --> 30:59.616
- There's wine
all over the place.

30:59.616 --> 31:00.817
Look at this.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.619
- Babe, what did you do
to the door?

31:02.619 --> 31:04.120
- That was like that
when I got here.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.488
- It's on the wall.

31:05.488 --> 31:06.656
- You can fix that with
a little bit of paint.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.157
- It's, like, on the wall.

31:08.157 --> 31:09.492
- A little bit of paint
right there and some spackle.

31:09.492 --> 31:12.495
- Nikki runs in and pours
the entire bottle of wine

31:12.495 --> 31:14.297
on Angelina.

31:14.297 --> 31:17.066
- I would actually prefer to
go back to the emergency room.

31:17.066 --> 31:18.968
I do not want to
deal with this right now.

31:18.968 --> 31:20.269
- So Angelina walks out,

31:20.269 --> 31:22.105
like, literally dripping
with red wine

31:22.105 --> 31:25.041
from like, her head all the way
down her body,

31:25.041 --> 31:26.609
hysterical crying.

31:26.609 --> 31:27.977
- Think they're gonna
wake up today

31:27.977 --> 31:30.246
and be like, "Ha-ha, Deena,
it was a prank"?

31:30.246 --> 31:32.849
- I hope so.
[both chuckle]

31:32.849 --> 31:34.684
I pray that that was a prank.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.686
- No one's that good of
an actor, except Deena.

31:36.686 --> 31:37.820
- Yeah.

31:37.820 --> 31:39.656
- If Angelina was
acting last night,

31:39.656 --> 31:40.990
and was crying
the way she was--

31:40.990 --> 31:43.159
- Emmy.
- Emmy gold.

31:43.159 --> 31:45.228
- Wow, that's crazy.

31:45.228 --> 31:47.563
- I was living my best life
at the hospital,

31:47.563 --> 31:49.465
while, apparently,
all the roommates were throwing

31:49.465 --> 31:51.000
[bleep] bottles at each other.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.201
- Definitely not getting

31:52.201 --> 31:53.836
the security deposit back
on this bitch.

31:53.836 --> 31:55.505
- It was, like, probably
one of the worst fights

31:55.505 --> 31:57.407
that's happened
in a very long time.

31:57.407 --> 31:59.075
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, damn.

31:59.075 --> 32:00.243
- It's like a crime scene.

32:00.243 --> 32:02.545
- Her go-to move
is destruction.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.180
- I just don't like
what happened last night.

32:04.180 --> 32:05.581
That freaked me out.

32:05.581 --> 32:07.550
- I do estimate that
Angelina's gonna come in hot

32:07.550 --> 32:08.785
and she's gonna blame Vinny

32:08.785 --> 32:10.019
for something, so--
- Cool.

- I was just opening it
for you.

33:03.051 --> 33:04.520
I was being a gentleman.

33:43.425 --> 33:44.626
<i>Thanks, Angelina.</i>

33:44.626 --> 33:46.762
- Her go-to move

33:46.762 --> 33:49.698
- Like, listen, don't go
whaling [bleep] at people

33:49.698 --> 33:52.301
and get mad
when it gets done to you.

33:52.301 --> 33:54.369
- Yeah.
- My outfit was red.

33:54.369 --> 33:56.138
And it's fine,
but it's just a principle.

33:56.138 --> 33:58.173
Like, don't do that [bleep]
and then go hide.

33:58.173 --> 34:00.008
- Nikki, welcome to the family

34:00.008 --> 34:01.443
<i>because that's how
it goes down.</i>

34:01.443 --> 34:03.412
Next time, maybe
we shouldn't lock the doors,

34:03.412 --> 34:04.980
because I like all my doors
open.

34:04.980 --> 34:07.082
I wonder what would happen if
Jenni would have been here.

34:07.082 --> 34:08.450
Because if she would've got
hit with the water too--

34:08.450 --> 34:09.918
- I think Jenni would've
started punching.

34:09.918 --> 34:11.420
- Yeah.
- Like, just for no reason.

34:11.420 --> 34:13.055
- [laughs]

34:13.055 --> 34:14.957
- Has anyone talked
to Pauly and Nikki?

34:14.957 --> 34:16.558
- I did text Nikki and Pauly.

34:16.558 --> 34:19.027
And you know,
they said that they're fine.

34:19.027 --> 34:21.029
I think they want an apology.
- Yeah.

34:21.029 --> 34:23.398
<i>- This could either go great</i>

34:23.398 --> 34:26.235
if she does apologize
for her actions,

34:26.235 --> 34:28.670
or it could go the other way
if she doesn't.

34:28.670 --> 34:30.005
Honestly, that was like,

34:30.005 --> 34:31.773
probably one of the worst
fights that's happened

34:31.773 --> 34:32.841
in a very long time.

34:32.841 --> 34:34.476
- Stop [bleep] interrupting!

34:34.476 --> 34:35.811
- Stop [bleep] yelling at me!

34:35.811 --> 34:37.045
- I'm not done!

34:37.045 --> 34:38.447
- You think I speak
negatively to you?

34:38.447 --> 34:40.282
- It's affecting my whole life.

34:40.282 --> 34:42.351
- You gotta be
[bleep] kidding me.

34:42.351 --> 34:43.652
- [bleep] off.

34:43.652 --> 34:45.387
- Thank God it didn't get,
like, physical.

34:45.387 --> 34:47.556
- I feel like it was close
to getting physical.

34:47.556 --> 34:49.591
- Just, like, another
few more seconds.

34:49.591 --> 34:52.127
Say like,
Angelina pushed Nikki or--

34:52.127 --> 34:53.595
- Oy vey.

34:53.595 --> 34:54.897
I don't know how
today's gonna go.

34:54.897 --> 34:58.000
It really depends on
how everybody handles it.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.302
So I know Jenni's eating.

35:00.302 --> 35:02.871
And then, we're gonna go
check on Angelina,

35:02.871 --> 35:04.673
see how she's doing
this morning.

35:04.673 --> 35:08.043
Because last night
she was not OK.

35:08.043 --> 35:09.578
- She's just gonna
blame it on--

35:09.578 --> 35:11.113
she's gonna blame it on Vinny.

35:11.113 --> 35:12.447
- Oh, this is all gonna be
my fault somehow.

35:12.447 --> 35:13.448
- Because you said
"just kidding."

35:13.448 --> 35:14.449
- Because I said "JK."

35:14.449 --> 35:15.617
I even wrote it in, like,

35:15.617 --> 35:16.852
the smallest font
you can write it in.

35:16.852 --> 35:18.987
Like, so non-aggressive.

35:18.987 --> 35:20.956
Yet, like,
without me doing that,

35:20.956 --> 35:22.224
this wouldn't have happened.

35:22.224 --> 35:24.960
- Then that "just kidding"
just caused--

35:24.960 --> 35:27.362
it just didn't need to
be put on the story.

35:27.362 --> 35:29.531
And that caused her
to turn to violence.

35:29.531 --> 35:30.999
- Exactly.

35:30.999 --> 35:32.801
- [gasps]

35:34.303 --> 35:35.804
- She was in there
for like, 45 minutes.

35:35.804 --> 35:38.607
I'm like,
what is she doing in there?

35:38.607 --> 35:40.542
- Yep.
- And I'm like this, right?

35:40.542 --> 35:42.010
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:42.010 --> 35:44.212
I have the photo. Right there.
- Oh, my God.

35:44.212 --> 35:45.547

it all went wrong.

35:45.547 --> 35:47.516
- Yeah.
It was at this moment--

36:03.732 --> 36:05.901

36:50.267 --> 36:51.736
<i>- ♪ So what, I messed it up ♪</i>

36:51.736 --> 36:53.738
<i>♪ I said too much,
I pushed my luck ♪</i>

36:53.738 --> 36:55.840
- You wanna go meet up
with Angelina?

36:55.840 --> 36:56.841
- Yeah.
- OK, have fun.

36:56.841 --> 36:58.109
I'll finish breakfast.

36:58.109 --> 36:59.643
- You have to shower.
- Yeah.

36:59.643 --> 37:00.945
- Bye, babe. Love you.

37:00.945 --> 37:02.947
I'm not sure
how this is gonna go,

37:02.947 --> 37:04.515
especially after last night,

37:04.515 --> 37:06.117
when Angelina is telling me

37:06.117 --> 37:08.052
she's not apologizing
to anyone.

37:08.052 --> 37:11.889
I feel like
this all solely depends

37:11.889 --> 37:14.225
on Angelina's energy.

37:14.225 --> 37:15.793
Ooh.

37:15.793 --> 37:16.994
- [sighs]
- Hey.

37:16.994 --> 37:18.562
- Hey, come in.
You want to come in?

37:18.562 --> 37:20.464
- Are you--are you
in a cave right now?

37:23.267 --> 37:25.636
- OK.
- Um...

37:25.636 --> 37:28.038
yeah, I woke up with a really,
really, really bad migraine.

37:28.038 --> 37:29.573
I just don't like
what happened last night.

37:29.573 --> 37:30.741
- Deena told me.

37:30.741 --> 37:32.143
- It freaked me out.

37:32.143 --> 37:34.345
I get it. I'm an asshole.
I threw wine.

37:34.345 --> 37:37.148
But still, that did not
have to go that route.

37:37.148 --> 37:38.816
<i>It didn't have to
get that bad.</i>

37:38.816 --> 37:40.518
That was a scary situation
to be in.

37:40.518 --> 37:42.520
And I don't ever want
to deal with that again.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.455
- Just sounds very chaotic.
- For what?

37:44.455 --> 37:46.724
Because of a [bleep] glass--
because over a glass of wine?

37:46.724 --> 37:48.259
- Can I go back to
the emergency room?

37:48.259 --> 37:50.561
- I think she wanted to
get you back with the wine.

37:50.561 --> 37:52.696
- See, that's what
they're gonna go with,

37:52.696 --> 37:54.432
that I threw--
that I threw red--red wine.

37:54.432 --> 37:57.001
That's their whole spiel.
- But you did though, right?

37:57.001 --> 37:58.636
So this is a little awkward.

37:58.636 --> 38:01.305
Because Angelina is known
not to take responsibility

38:01.305 --> 38:03.474
on some things.

38:03.474 --> 38:05.709
My last 10 years.

38:05.709 --> 38:08.345
And she's not taking
responsibility right now.

38:08.345 --> 38:10.247
Like, I am concerned
that this trauma

38:10.247 --> 38:11.782
is gonna just keep on going.

38:11.782 --> 38:13.284
- They can say whatever
the [bleep] they want to,

38:13.284 --> 38:14.552
if it's red wine, water.

38:14.552 --> 38:17.254
She dumped a [bleep]
water bottle in my face.

38:17.254 --> 38:19.957
I did not throw a water
at her at all.

38:19.957 --> 38:21.125
I threw it on Vinny.

38:21.125 --> 38:22.626
She got sprinkles on her.

38:22.626 --> 38:23.794
She went to that extent.

38:23.794 --> 38:25.262
And then I grabbed whatever.

38:25.262 --> 38:27.731
- I think it just got crazy.

38:27.731 --> 38:30.734
Like, I think everybody's
emotions were high.

38:30.734 --> 38:31.869
And that's why
I kept telling you,

38:31.869 --> 38:33.904
just go back to the room,
shower.

38:33.904 --> 38:35.139
Maybe when we wake up
in the morning,

38:35.139 --> 38:37.808
everything will just be calmer,
you know?

38:37.808 --> 38:40.578
- All I know is
it was meant to be a joke

38:40.578 --> 38:43.113
to throw it at Vinny because
he was a jerk off last night.

38:43.113 --> 38:44.815
- It was one thing to stand
in front of him and yell,

38:44.815 --> 38:45.816
like you always do.

38:45.816 --> 38:46.817
But like, what was the point

38:46.817 --> 38:48.085
of pouring water on him?

38:48.085 --> 38:49.487
Because you know he can't
do it back to you?

38:49.487 --> 38:51.755
- I feel she was dead wrong.

38:51.755 --> 38:54.058
Is she gonna,
like, own up to that?

38:54.058 --> 38:55.392
I don't think so.

38:55.392 --> 38:57.495
I do estimate that Angelina's
gonna come in hot

38:57.495 --> 38:58.963
and she's going to blame Vinny
for something, so--

38:58.963 --> 39:00.131
- Cool.

39:00.131 --> 39:01.265
- Well, she'll never
blame herself.

39:01.265 --> 39:02.333
- But you need to own up
to your [bleep].

39:02.333 --> 39:03.667
- She won't take
accountability.

39:03.667 --> 39:05.102
- And then I'll step in again.
I'm like, listen,

39:05.102 --> 39:06.871
you got all of us caught in
your wrath last night.

39:06.871 --> 39:08.739
- Hey, what's up
- Yo.

39:08.739 --> 39:10.608
- How's Jenni?
- She's good.

39:10.608 --> 39:12.543
- Cool.
- Yeah, guys.

39:12.543 --> 39:14.178
- Yeah, you missed
a doozy last night, bro.

39:14.178 --> 39:15.846
- I heard that.
- Do you see the door?

39:15.846 --> 39:17.281
<i>- If I was, like,
in the hospital</i>

39:17.281 --> 39:18.449
<i>and I came back to all this,</i>

39:18.449 --> 39:19.917
I wouldn't even know
what to think.

39:19.917 --> 39:22.019
Pauly D broke down the door,
there was wine thrown,

39:22.019 --> 39:23.854
water on Vinny,
he posted something.

39:23.854 --> 39:25.022
Like, what a nightmare.

39:25.022 --> 39:26.423
- We can't come back
to this hotel.

39:26.423 --> 39:28.926
- Nah, we're [bleep].
- There's wine everywhere.

39:28.926 --> 39:30.194
- Yeah, I dumped it on
the top of her head.

39:30.194 --> 39:31.262
- It ended up on the door.

39:31.262 --> 39:32.530
- I'm pretty sure
I drowned her.

39:32.530 --> 39:34.131
Did we check on her?
- Just got my nose done.

39:34.131 --> 39:35.332
Like, are you kidding me?

39:35.332 --> 39:36.901
Like, I got to
fistfight people now?

39:36.901 --> 39:38.068
- So where do we go from here?

39:38.068 --> 39:39.370
Are you gonna come out today?

39:39.370 --> 39:40.571
- I'm gonna be honest with you,

39:40.571 --> 39:42.139
like, I'm just checked out.

39:42.139 --> 39:43.240
[knocking on door]
all: Oh.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.909
- Hey.
- What up, guys?

39:44.909 --> 39:45.943
- Good morning.

39:45.943 --> 39:47.578
I wouldn't sit there.

39:47.578 --> 39:49.914
- Flip this thing up.

39:49.914 --> 39:51.615
- I feel like it went from,
like, zero to 100

39:51.615 --> 39:53.551
in, like, literally,
15 seconds.

39:53.551 --> 39:54.852
- Yeah.
- I don't want to put any words

39:54.852 --> 39:56.587
in her mouth, but last night,

39:56.587 --> 39:59.156
she was pretty adamant that
she--she wasn't doing like,

39:59.156 --> 40:00.391
the apology tour this morning.

40:00.391 --> 40:02.526
- Oh.
- No way. I'm shocked.

40:02.526 --> 40:03.727
- Yeah, no, no.

40:03.727 --> 40:04.795
And that's what
you're dealing with.

40:04.795 --> 40:06.030
- Yeah.

40:06.030 --> 40:07.331
- Where are you to
willing to go from here?

40:07.331 --> 40:10.434
- Right now, I'm not willing
to hear anyone's,

40:10.434 --> 40:12.770
like, she-said, he-said.
I'm not willing to hear,

40:12.770 --> 40:14.238
"You threw this
and you threw that."

40:14.238 --> 40:16.173
- But if Vinny didn't
come on this vacation,

40:16.173 --> 40:17.908
it never would have happened.
- Yep, yes. I agree.

40:17.908 --> 40:19.243
- So I blame him.
- Yep.

40:19.243 --> 40:21.278
- I think we need to
give her an apology.

40:21.278 --> 40:23.147
- Yes, let's all do that.
Yo, let's do that.

40:23.147 --> 40:24.715
Angelina, we're sorry.

40:24.715 --> 40:26.884
For whatever we did wrong,
we are sorry.

40:26.884 --> 40:28.652
- It's your world,
we're just living in it.

40:28.652 --> 40:30.454
There's a lot of beef
on the barbecue.

40:30.454 --> 40:33.591
I mean, people were busting
down doors last night.

40:33.591 --> 40:36.527
And we don't know
how to proceed.

40:36.527 --> 40:37.628
- Where do we go from here?

40:37.628 --> 40:39.630
<i>- ♪ I was drinking water ♪</i>

40:39.630 --> 40:42.766
<i>♪ When I could be
drinking wine ♪</i>

40:42.766 --> 40:44.835
<i>- Well, all I know, is that</i>

40:44.835 --> 40:47.037
<i>the old Sitch has nothing
to do with it.</i>

40:47.037 --> 40:48.639
[chuckles]

40:48.639 --> 40:50.374
All right, let's go on
jet skis.

40:50.374 --> 40:53.811
[laughter]

40:53.811 --> 40:56.000
<i>- ♪ You can't hurt me ♪</i>

40:57.501 --> 40:58.369
<i>- If they start coming at me
sideways,</i>

40:58.369 --> 40:59.670
<i>I'm gonna lose my mind.</i>

40:59.670 --> 41:01.572
- Oh, well, well, well,
if it isn't Jesus.

41:01.572 --> 41:02.906
- This girl is unreasonable.

41:02.906 --> 41:04.074
She was basically
putting it on him.

41:04.074 --> 41:05.342
- Let's go!

41:05.342 --> 41:06.577
- Crushing the meat
and eating the beef.

41:06.577 --> 41:07.911
- Leave me alone!

41:07.911 --> 41:11.048
- Today is V-Day.

41:11.048 --> 41:12.983
<i>It's a party for me.</i>

41:12.983 --> 41:14.785
- Wait, where are you
taking us, to your mom's house?

41:14.785 --> 41:15.786
[laughter]
