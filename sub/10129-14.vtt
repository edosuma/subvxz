09:27.900 --> 09:29.500
I WISH<i>I </i>WAS COMFORTABLE.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.700
I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA DO WITH MYSELF.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.200
WE GRADUATE IN MAY.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.867
FOUR MONTHS, AND WE'RE
THROWN OUT INTO THE REAL WORLD.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.767
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?

09:38.767 --> 09:41.600
ALL THIS TIME, I'VE STUDIED
ENGINEERING AND JOURNALISM.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.600
NOW COMES THE TIME
WHEN I HAVE TO CHOOSE

09:43.600 --> 09:46.500
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM, AND I
WANT TO BE A LAWYER LIKE RACHEL.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.600
OH, LAWYER WAS, LIKE,
EIGHT CAREERS AGO.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.500
I DON'T WANT
TO BE A LAWYER, EITHER.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.600
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO BE?
I WANT TO BE ERIC.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.300
I MEAN, HE'S THE LUCKY ONE.

09:55.300 --> 09:58.100
OH, COME ON. YOU'RE
SAYING THAT FOR MY BENEFIT.

09:58.100 --> 10:01.400
NO, REALLY. HE'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT HAS A HANDLE ON THINGS.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.033
HE IS?

10:03.033 --> 10:07.300
YEAH, HE'S GOT A JOB.
HIS FUTURE'S ALL SET.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.767
YEAH.

10:08.767 --> 10:12.233
HE'S THE ONLY ONE OF YOU GUYS
WHOSE FUTURE IS ALL SET.

10:12.233 --> 10:14.667
IMAGINE THAT.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.967
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT, GEORGE?

10:16.967 --> 10:20.467
MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO GO HELP
YOUR<i>OTHER </i>LITTLE LOST SHEEP.

10:20.467 --> 10:23.867
HELP THEM FIND THEIR WAY.
ERIC'S GOING TO BE FINE.

10:23.867 --> 10:25.233
ALAN...

10:25.233 --> 10:27.000
WHAT? A LITTLE PROUD
OF MY KID HERE?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.734
I ADMIT --
I WAS NERVOUS FOR HIM --

10:28.734 --> 10:30.233
YOU NEVER BELIEVED IN HIM.

10:30.233 --> 10:32.100
NO, I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS
FOR HIM.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.900
YOU<i>STILL </i>DON'T BELIEVEIN HIM.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.800
YOU THINK HE WILL
GO OUT IN THE WORLD

10:35.800 --> 10:39.000
AND EXPERIENCE DISAPPOINTMENT,
SO YOU WANT TO LOCK HIM UP HERE.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.934
I THOUGHT IF HE WOULD
BE HERE WITH YOU,

10:40.934 --> 10:42.800
HE WOULD GAIN EXPERIENCE
AND CONFIDENCE

10:42.800 --> 10:44.500
AND BE READY TO GO OUT
IN THE WORLD.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.500
AND NOW, I THINK IT MIGHT BE
THE<i>WORST </i>PLACE FOR HIM.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.233
HE'S SAFE HERE.
HE'S A STEP AHEAD OF THEM.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.834
I WAS THINKING MED SCHOOL.

10:51.834 --> 10:53.200
YOU'D MAKE A GREAT DOCTOR.

I LOVE ANIMALS.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.300
I JUST LOVE
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.100
YOU KNOW,
I LOVE ANIMALS, TOO.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.667
IT WOULD BE A LITTLE SHOP,

11:03.667 --> 11:06.400
AND YOU'D HELP FIX UP
LITTLE KIDS' PETS AND STUFF.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.367
WITH A BUNCH OF LETTERS
ON THE WALL

11:08.367 --> 11:11.233
FROM LITTLE KIDS THANKING ME
FOR HELPING THEIR DOGS.

11:11.233 --> 11:16.500
WHAT ABOUT THE ONES
YOU'D HAVE TO PUT TO SLEEP?

11:16.500 --> 11:19.200
I'M GONNA BE A CATERER.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.300
YOU RATHER
HE WAS CONFUSED LIKE THEM?

11:21.300 --> 11:24.667
YOU KNOW WHY THEY'RE CONFUSED?
BECAUSE<i>THEY </i>HAVE CHOICES.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.300
THEY BELIEVE
THEY ARE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.

11:27.300 --> 11:30.300
AMY, NOT EVERYBODY
IS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.

11:30.300 --> 11:33.867
ALAN, EVENTUALLY, I HAVE TO
LET MY STUDENTS GRADUATE.

11:33.867 --> 11:36.133
I SHELTER THEM
AS MUCH AS I CAN,

11:36.133 --> 11:38.800
BUT, FINALLY,
I HAVE TO LET THEM GO.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.834
WE COULD KEEP ERIC HERE.
WE KNOW HE WOULD DO FINE.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.767
BUT WE WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE HE WAS CAPABLE OF.

11:44.767 --> 11:47.500
AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORSE?
NEITHER WOULD HE.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.133
WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE.

11:49.133 --> 11:52.300
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S BEST FOR MY SON.

I DO THE EULOGY.
YOU LIGHT THE ETERNAL FLAME.

12:10.834 --> 12:14.900
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER GIVEN HIM
THAT STUPID<i>COUPLES </i>QUIZ.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.400
WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY?

12:16.400 --> 12:19.233
HE STOPPED OFF THERE
TO GET HIS TEST RESULTS BACK.

12:19.233 --> 12:22.100
WHAT IF HE FINDS OUT THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM?

12:22.100 --> 12:26.600

WHAT HE WON'T LET ME TOUCH?

12:35.867 --> 12:38.000
"NO, NOT THERE!
I MIGHT GET CANCER."

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
WHERE?

12:43.867 --> 12:47.300
TOPANGA, WHAT IF THERE ACTUALLY
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.133
HE'S JUST DOING THIS
BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID

12:49.133 --> 12:51.133
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE CARE OF HIM
WHEN HE'S 80.

12:51.133 --> 12:52.734
HE'S DOING THIS
TO GET ATTENTION.

12:52.734 --> 12:53.834
HE IS?

12:53.834 --> 12:54.900
YES.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.800
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GIVE IT TO HIM?

12:56.800 --> 12:59.300
I'D RATHER GIVE HIM ATTENTION
FOR ACTING NORMAL.

OH, HONEY, WE KNOW
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

13:02.734 --> 13:03.800

IT MEANS YOU CREATE STUFF
IN YOUR HEAD.

14:19.600 --> 14:23.200
YES, WELL,
HE GAVE ME THESE PLACEBOS.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.100
PLACEBOS ARE WHAT THEY GIVE
TO CRAZY PEOPLE LIKE YOU
