01:06.319 --> 01:08.113
<i>Choose a three-piece suite

01:08.238 --> 01:10.031

01:10.157 --> 01:13.285
<i>Choose D.I.Y. and wondering who

01:13.368 --> 01:15.328
<i>Choose sitting,

01:15.412 --> 01:16.997
<i>spirit-crushing game shows,</i>

01:27.507 --> 01:28.633
Tommy, go!

01:28.759 --> 01:30.552
<i>Choose rotting away

01:30.677 --> 01:32.304
<i>pissing your last

01:32.429 --> 01:34.306
<i>An embarrassment
to the selfish,</i>

01:34.389 --> 01:37.142
<i>fucked-up brats that you've
spawned to replace yourself.</i>

01:37.267 --> 01:39.978
<i>Choose your future.
Choose life.</i>

<i># Here comes Johnny Yen again #</i>

01:44.441 --> 01:46.151
<i># With the liquor and drugs #</i>

01:46.276 --> 01:48.820
<i>But why would I want to do
a thing like that?</i>

01:49.488 --> 01:53.450
<i># He's gonna do
another striptease #</i>

01:53.533 --> 01:55.535
<i>I chose not to choose life.</i>

01:55.660 --> 01:57.496
<i>I chose something else.</i>

01:57.579 --> 01:59.122
<i>And the reasons?</i>

02:00.082 --> 02:02.042
<i>There are no reasons.</i>

02:02.459 --> 02:05.003
<i>Who needs reasons
when you've got heroin?</i>

02:05.712 --> 02:08.006
<i># Yeah, something called love #</i>

02:08.131 --> 02:12.344
<i># Well, that's like
hypnotizing chickens #</i>

02:15.847 --> 02:18.392
"Goldfinger's"
better than "Dr. No. "

02:19.976 --> 02:23.230
Both of them are a lot better
than "Diamonds Are Forever. "

02:23.355 --> 02:26.066
A judgment reflected
in its relatively poor showing

02:26.191 --> 02:27.818
at the box office.

02:29.027 --> 02:30.570
In which field, of course,

02:30.695 --> 02:35.283
"Thunderball"
was a notable success.

02:35.409 --> 02:37.911
<i>People think it's all
about misery and desperation</i>

02:38.036 --> 02:40.872
<i>and death and all that shite,
which is not to be ignored.</i>

02:40.956 --> 02:44.000
Fuck off!
Doss cunt!

02:44.835 --> 02:48.755
<i>But what they forget
is the pleasure of it.</i>

02:48.880 --> 02:51.466
Wild hands like me!

02:52.717 --> 02:54.469
You prick!

02:55.887 --> 02:58.557
<i>Otherwise we wouldn't do it.</i>

02:58.640 --> 03:01.101
- Do you want me to do it?
- Yeah.

03:01.226 --> 03:04.187
Beaut as the driven snow,
that shit, Danny.

03:08.692 --> 03:10.610
<i>After all,
we're not fucking stupid.</i>

03:10.736 --> 03:13.321
<i>Well, at least, we're not
that fucking stupid.</i>

03:25.292 --> 03:27.919
<i>Take the best orgasm
you ever had,</i>

03:28.003 --> 03:32.340
<i>multiply it by 1, 000, and
you're still nowhere near it.</i>

03:32.466 --> 03:35.719
That beats any meat injection.

03:38.096 --> 03:42.184
That beats any fucking cock
in the world.

03:42.309 --> 03:45.604
<i>When you're on junk, you have
only one worry. Scoring.</i>

03:45.729 --> 03:49.649
<i>When you're off it, you worry
about all sorts of other shite.</i>

03:49.775 --> 03:51.234
<i>Got no money.
Can't get drunk.</i>

03:51.318 --> 03:52.778
<i>Got money.
Drinking too much.</i>

03:52.861 --> 03:54.529
<i>Can't get a girl.
No chance of a ride.</i>

03:54.654 --> 03:56.782
<i>Got a girl.
Too much hassle.</i>

03:56.907 --> 03:59.117
<i>You have to worry about bills,
about food,</i>

03:59.242 --> 04:01.244
<i>about some football team
that never wins,</i>

04:01.328 --> 04:02.913
<i>about human relationships</i>

04:02.996 --> 04:04.998
<i>and all of the things
that don't matter</i>

04:05.082 --> 04:08.919
<i>when you've got a sincere
and truthful junk habit.</i>

04:10.128 --> 04:13.757
I'd say, in those days,
he was a muscular actor.

04:15.008 --> 04:18.345
With all the presence of someone
like Cooper or Lancaster,

04:18.470 --> 04:21.180
but combined with a sly wit...

04:22.474 --> 04:25.477
...to make him a formidable
romantic lead.

04:26.186 --> 04:29.314
Closer in that respect
to Cary Grant.

04:29.856 --> 04:31.316
Aah.

04:32.901 --> 04:37.280
<i># Hey, man,
where'd ya get that lotion? #</i>

04:37.364 --> 04:41.952
<i># Your skin starts itching
once you buy the gimmick #</i>

04:42.035 --> 04:44.413
<i># About something called love #</i>

04:44.538 --> 04:45.997
<i># Love, love, love #</i>

04:46.123 --> 04:49.709
<i># Well, that's like
hypnotizing chickens #</i>

04:49.835 --> 04:53.338
<i>The only drawback, or at least
the principal drawback,</i>

04:53.463 --> 04:56.049
<i>is that you have to endure
cunts telling you...</i>

04:56.174 --> 04:59.594
"No way would I poison my body
with that shite. "

05:00.804 --> 05:03.014
All the fucking chemicals.

05:04.516 --> 05:06.476
No fucking way.

05:08.603 --> 05:10.188
It's a waste of your life, Mark,

05:10.272 --> 05:12.691
poisoning your body
with that shite.

05:12.774 --> 05:16.445
Every chance you've had, son,
you've blown it.

05:16.570 --> 05:19.072
Stuffing your veins
with that filth.

05:19.197 --> 05:22.534
<i>From time to time, even I
have uttered the magic words.</i>

05:27.497 --> 05:29.875
Never again, Swanney.
I'm off the scag.

05:29.958 --> 05:30.876
Are you serious?

05:30.959 --> 05:34.045
Yeah. No more.
I'm finished with that shite.

05:34.171 --> 05:35.088
It's up to you.

05:35.172 --> 05:37.758
I'm going to get it sorted out,
get off it for good.

05:37.883 --> 05:39.885
I sure have heard
that one before.

05:40.010 --> 05:41.720
The Sick Boy method.

05:41.845 --> 05:43.847
Well, it really worked
for him, eh?

05:43.930 --> 05:45.849
He's always been lacking
in moral fiber.

05:45.932 --> 05:47.225
He knows a lot
about Sean Connery.

05:47.350 --> 05:49.561
That's hardly a substitute.

05:49.644 --> 05:51.480
You need one more hit.

05:51.605 --> 05:52.647
No, I don't think so.

05:52.773 --> 05:54.983
For the long night
that lies ahead.

05:56.777 --> 05:58.195
<i>We called him Mother Superior</i>

05:58.278 --> 06:00.405
<i>on account of the length
of his habit.</i>

06:00.489 --> 06:02.491
<i>Of course
I'd have another shot.</i>

06:02.616 --> 06:04.117
<i>After all, I had work to do.</i>

06:20.759 --> 06:24.054
<i>Relinquishing junk, stage one.
Preparation.</i>

06:28.141 --> 06:31.269
<i>For this you will need one
room, which you will not leave.</i>

06:31.395 --> 06:35.315
<i>Soothing music.
Tomato soup, 10 tins of.</i>

06:36.650 --> 06:40.195
<i>Mushroom soup, 8 tins of
for consumption cold.</i>

06:40.904 --> 06:43.573
<i>Ice cream, vanilla,
one large tub of.</i>

06:43.657 --> 06:45.700
<i>Magnesia, milk of, one bottle.</i>

06:45.826 --> 06:48.161
<i>Paracetamol,
mouthwash, vitamins,</i>

06:48.286 --> 06:52.624
<i>mineral water,
Lucozade, pornography.</i>

06:53.583 --> 06:55.001
<i>One mattress.</i>

06:55.085 --> 06:59.047
<i>One bucket for urine, one
for feces, and one for vomitus.</i>

07:00.507 --> 07:01.508
<i>One television.</i>

07:01.591 --> 07:04.261
<i>One bottle of Valium, which
I procured from my mother,</i>

07:04.344 --> 07:07.597
<i>who is, in her own domestic
and socially acceptable way,</i>

07:07.681 --> 07:09.641
<i>also a drug addict.</i>

07:13.145 --> 07:14.855
<i>And now I'm ready.</i>

07:14.980 --> 07:16.481
<i>All I need is one final hit</i>

07:16.606 --> 07:20.360
<i>to soothe the pain while
the Valium takes effect.</i>

07:22.529 --> 07:25.574
Mikey. Hi.
Yeah, it's Mark Renton.

07:25.699 --> 07:28.201
Look, could you help me out?

07:28.326 --> 07:31.121
<i>This was typical
of Mikey Forrester.</i>

07:31.663 --> 07:33.999
What the fuck are these?

07:34.082 --> 07:35.125
<i>Under the normal run of things</i>

07:35.208 --> 07:36.376
<i>I would have had nothing to do
with the cunt,</i>

07:36.501 --> 07:38.545
<i>but this was not
the normal run of things.</i>

07:38.670 --> 07:41.214
Opium suppositories.

07:41.339 --> 07:43.216
Ideal for your purposes.

07:43.341 --> 07:47.179
Slow release.
Bring you down gradually.

07:48.221 --> 07:50.265
Custom-fucking-designed
for your needs.

07:50.390 --> 07:51.850
I want a fucking hit!

07:51.975 --> 07:53.351
That's all I've got, man.

07:53.435 --> 07:55.228
Take it or leave it.

08:06.239 --> 08:08.158
Are you feeling better now?

08:08.241 --> 08:09.785
For all the good
they've done me,

08:09.910 --> 08:12.579
I might as well have
stuck them up my arse.

08:14.706 --> 08:16.792
<i>Heroin makes you constipated.</i>

08:16.917 --> 08:19.002
<i>The heroin from my last hit
is fading away.</i>

08:19.086 --> 08:21.379
<i>The suppositories
have yet to melt.</i>

08:21.505 --> 08:23.173
Ohh!

08:23.965 --> 08:26.093
<i>I'm no longer constipated.</i>

08:34.101 --> 08:37.520
<i>I fantasize about massive
pristine convenience.</i>

08:37.604 --> 08:41.191
<i>Brilliant gold taps,
virginal-white marble,</i>

08:41.274 --> 08:44.611
<i>a seat carved from ebony,
a cistern full of Chanel No. 5,</i>

08:44.736 --> 08:48.907
<i>and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll.</i>

08:49.032 --> 08:52.411
<i>But under the circumstances,
I'll settle for anywhere.</i>

09:04.381 --> 09:05.882
Ohh.

09:12.973 --> 09:14.516
Fuck.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.601
Ohh! Oh!

09:20.564 --> 09:21.523
Ahh.

10:46.483 --> 10:50.153
Yes, a fucking Godsend!

11:28.233 --> 11:29.651
<i>And now.</i>

11:29.776 --> 11:31.445
<i>Now I'm ready.</i>

11:32.946 --> 11:34.239
<i>The downside of coming off junk</i>

11:34.322 --> 11:36.283
<i>was I knew I would mix
with my friends</i>

11:36.408 --> 11:38.326
<i>in a state of full
consciousness.</i>

11:38.452 --> 11:39.745
<i>It was awful.</i>

11:39.870 --> 11:41.288
<i>They reminded me of myself.</i>

11:41.371 --> 11:43.123
<i>I could hardly bear
to look at them.</i>

11:43.248 --> 11:44.833
<i>Take Sick Boy, for instance.</i>

11:44.958 --> 11:46.626
<i>He came off junk
at the same time.</i>

11:46.752 --> 11:48.545
<i>Not because he wanted to.</i>

11:48.628 --> 11:49.629
<i>Just to annoy me.</i>

11:49.713 --> 11:51.757
<i>Just to show me
how easily he could do it,</i>

11:51.882 --> 11:54.301
<i>thereby downgrading
my own struggle.</i>

11:54.384 --> 11:56.428
<i>Sneaky fucker, don't you think?</i>

11:56.511 --> 11:59.598
<i>When I wanted to lie there
and feel sorry for myself,</i>

11:59.723 --> 12:01.475
<i>he insisted on telling me
once again</i>

12:01.600 --> 12:03.560
<i>about his unifying theory
of life.</i>

12:03.643 --> 12:06.980
It's certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life.

12:07.105 --> 12:08.398
What do you mean?

12:09.524 --> 12:11.651
Well, at one point,
you've got it.

12:11.777 --> 12:14.321
Then you lose it,
and it's gone forever.

12:14.446 --> 12:16.114
All walks of life.

12:16.990 --> 12:20.118
Georgie Best, for example,
had it, lost it.

12:20.202 --> 12:22.788
Or David Bowie, or Lou Reed.

12:22.871 --> 12:24.873
Lou Reed? Some of his
solo stuff's not bad.

12:24.998 --> 12:27.751
No, it's not bad, but it's not
great either, is it?

12:27.834 --> 12:29.336
In your heart, you kind of know

12:29.419 --> 12:33.882
that although it sounds all
right, it's actually just shite.

12:35.634 --> 12:37.552
So who else?

12:38.595 --> 12:42.182
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven,
Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.

12:42.307 --> 12:45.811
Okay, okay, so what is the point
you're trying to make?

12:47.437 --> 12:50.524
All I am trying to do, Mark,
is to help you understand

12:50.649 --> 12:53.527
that "The Name of the Rose"
is merely a blip

12:53.610 --> 12:56.655
on an otherwise uninterrupted
downward trajectory.

12:56.780 --> 12:59.032
And what about
"The Untouchables"?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.785
I don't rate that at all.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.995
Despite the Academy Award?

13:04.704 --> 13:06.540
That means fuck all.

13:06.665 --> 13:08.625
It's a sympathy vote.

13:10.210 --> 13:14.005
So we all get old, we can't hack
it anymore, and that's it?

13:14.714 --> 13:16.049
Yeah.

13:16.174 --> 13:18.093
That's your theory?

13:19.261 --> 13:20.512
Yeah.

13:21.638 --> 13:23.974
Beautifully fucking illustrated.

13:25.475 --> 13:27.269
Give me the gun.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.521
Give me the gun.

13:36.069 --> 13:38.280
Do you see the beast?

13:38.405 --> 13:40.699
Have you got it in your sights?

13:40.782 --> 13:43.243
Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.

13:43.368 --> 13:48.081
This should present
no significant problems.

13:53.545 --> 13:56.423
Aah! No!
Fuck! Aah!

13:56.548 --> 14:01.303
For a vegetarian, Rents,
you're a fucking evil shot.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.472
No! Get off!

14:03.930 --> 14:06.058
<i>Without heroin,
I attempted to lead a useful</i>

14:06.141 --> 14:08.226
<i>and fulfilling life
as a good citizen.</i>

14:14.316 --> 14:15.901
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers, Cowboy.

14:15.984 --> 14:19.071
Remember, if they think you're
not trying, you're in trouble.

14:19.196 --> 14:21.073
First hint of that,
they'll be on to the DHSS.

14:21.156 --> 14:22.908
"This cunt is not trying. "

14:22.991 --> 14:25.118
And your giro is
fucking finished, right?

14:25.243 --> 14:26.703
But then again, try too hard...

14:26.828 --> 14:28.622
You might get the fucking job.

14:28.747 --> 14:29.539
Exactly.

14:29.623 --> 14:30.415
Nightmare.

14:30.540 --> 14:33.085
It's a tightrope, Spud.
It's a fucking tightrope.

14:33.210 --> 14:35.837
See, I just get pure shy
with the interviewer cats.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.215
I get all nervous.
I can't answer the questions.

14:38.298 --> 14:41.760
I'm a footballer, and I get
nerves on the big occasion, man.

14:41.843 --> 14:43.053
Try some of this, Spud.

14:43.136 --> 14:46.306
Yeah, a little dab of speed
is just the ticket, man.

14:47.599 --> 14:49.935
No, I went to Craigy.
Craig Newton.

14:50.018 --> 14:52.896
I just put down Royal Edinburgh
College to help get the job.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.981
There's too much discrimination
in this town.

14:55.107 --> 14:56.274
They're both schools.

14:56.358 --> 14:57.943
We're all in this together.

14:58.026 --> 15:00.779
I want to put across the general
idea rather than the details.

15:00.862 --> 15:02.406
People get hung up on details.

15:02.489 --> 15:04.825
Which school did I go to?
How many grades did I get?

15:04.950 --> 15:06.660
It could be six.
Could be none.

15:06.785 --> 15:07.994
It's not important.

15:08.120 --> 15:11.206
What is important
is that I am, yes?

15:11.331 --> 15:15.210
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you
lied on your application?

15:15.335 --> 15:16.461
No!

15:16.586 --> 15:19.631
Yes, only to get my foot
in the door.

15:19.756 --> 15:21.049
Showing initiative and that.

15:21.174 --> 15:23.260
You were referred by
the Department of Employment.

15:23.343 --> 15:26.221
There was no need for you to get
your "foot in the door,"

15:26.346 --> 15:27.848
as you put it.

15:27.973 --> 15:30.642
Cool. Whatever you say, man.
Sorry.

15:30.767 --> 15:32.644
You're the man,
the dude in the chair.

15:32.728 --> 15:36.106
I am merely here.
But obviously I'm here.

15:36.189 --> 15:38.442
Mr. Murphy,
what exactly attracts you

15:38.525 --> 15:40.485
to the leisure industry?

15:41.862 --> 15:44.156
In a word, pleasure.

15:44.239 --> 15:46.533
Like, my pleasure
in other people's leisure.

15:46.658 --> 15:50.036
Do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses?

15:52.205 --> 15:55.041
Oh, yes, 'cause I'm a bit
of a perfectionist, actually.

15:55.167 --> 15:56.042
Yes, I am.

15:56.168 --> 15:59.254
See, for me, it's got to be the
best, or it's nothing at all.

15:59.379 --> 16:02.048
Like, if things get a bit dodgy,
I cannot be bothered.

16:02.174 --> 16:05.510
But I've got good vibes about
this interview thing today.

16:05.635 --> 16:08.346
Seems to me like
it's going pretty well.

16:09.806 --> 16:11.641
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

16:12.559 --> 16:14.561
We'll let you know.

16:14.644 --> 16:15.687
The pleasure was mine.

16:15.812 --> 16:18.356
<i>Spud had done well.
I was proud of him.</i>

16:18.482 --> 16:22.402
<i>He fucked up good and proper.
You had to hand it to Spud.</i>

16:24.654 --> 16:26.031
Picture the scene.

16:26.114 --> 16:28.658
The other fucking week,
doing the fucking volley.

16:28.742 --> 16:30.077
Me and Tommy playing pool.

16:30.202 --> 16:32.454
I'm playing like
Paul fucking Newman by the way.

16:32.579 --> 16:35.457
Giving the boy here
the tanning of a lifetime.

16:36.166 --> 16:37.751
So it comes to the last shot.

16:37.876 --> 16:40.003
The deciding ball
of the whole tournament.

16:40.087 --> 16:41.671
I'm on the black,
and he's in the corner,

16:41.755 --> 16:43.757
looking all fucking
biscuit-arsed,

16:43.882 --> 16:46.009
when this hard cunt comes in.

16:46.093 --> 16:48.845
Obviously fucking
fancied himself, like.

16:48.929 --> 16:50.680
Starts staring at me.

16:50.764 --> 16:52.391
Looking at me,
right fucking at me,

16:52.474 --> 16:55.143
as if to say,
"Come ahead, square, go. "

16:55.268 --> 16:56.228
You know me.

16:56.353 --> 16:58.563
I'm not a type of cunt
that goes looking for bother.

16:58.688 --> 17:01.274
At the end of the day,
I'm the cunt with the pool cue,

17:01.400 --> 17:04.861
and he can get the fire end
in his puss anytime he wanted.

17:04.944 --> 17:07.989
So I squares up, casual like.

17:08.115 --> 17:12.035
What does the hard cunt do?
Or the so-called hard cunt?

17:12.118 --> 17:13.369
Shites it.

17:13.453 --> 17:17.332
Puts down his drink, turns,
and gets the fuck out of there.

17:17.457 --> 17:21.627
And after that,
well, the game was mine.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.217
<i>And that was it.</i>

17:27.300 --> 17:29.094
<i>That was Begbie's story.</i>

17:29.219 --> 17:31.596
<i>At least that was Begbie's
version of the story.</i>

17:31.680 --> 17:34.641
<i>But a couple of days later
I got the truth from Tommy.</i>

17:34.766 --> 17:36.560
<i>You always got the truth
from Tommy.</i>

17:36.643 --> 17:38.437
<i>It was one of
his major weaknesses.</i>

17:38.520 --> 17:40.605
<i>He never told lies,
he never took drugs,</i>

17:40.731 --> 17:42.649
<i>and he never cheated
on anyone.</i>

17:43.400 --> 17:44.776
It was Wednesday morning.

17:44.901 --> 17:46.820
We were in the volley
playing pool.

17:46.903 --> 17:48.321
That much is true.

17:48.405 --> 17:52.534
But Begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash.

17:52.659 --> 17:55.328
He's got a hangover so bad
he can hardly hold the cue,

17:55.454 --> 17:56.913
never mind pot a ball.

17:56.997 --> 17:58.999
I'm doing my best to lose,
you know.

17:59.124 --> 18:01.877
Trying to humor him, like,
but it's not doing any good.

18:02.002 --> 18:04.588
Every time I touch a ball,
I seem to pot something.

18:04.671 --> 18:07.424
Every time Begbie goes near
the table, he fucks it up.

18:07.507 --> 18:10.010
Oh, fuck's sake.

18:11.136 --> 18:14.097
So he's got the hump, right?

18:14.181 --> 18:17.559
But finally I manage to set it
up so all he has to do

18:17.684 --> 18:19.686
is to pot the black
to win one game

18:19.811 --> 18:21.480
to salvage a little bit of pride

18:21.563 --> 18:24.149
and maybe not kick
my head in, right?

18:24.274 --> 18:28.320
So he's on the black,
pressure shot.

18:30.739 --> 18:33.325
And it all goes wrong, big-time.

18:35.202 --> 18:36.203
Fuck!

18:36.870 --> 18:37.996
Aah!

18:38.580 --> 18:40.874
He picks on this specky
wee gadgee at the bar

18:40.999 --> 18:43.335
and accuses him of putting him
off by looking at him.

18:43.418 --> 18:44.377
Can you believe it?

18:44.503 --> 18:46.338
The cunt hasn't glanced
in our direction.

18:46.463 --> 18:47.547
Fuck off!

18:47.672 --> 18:49.925
He was going to chib him,
I tell you.

18:50.050 --> 18:52.427
Then I thought
he was going to do me.

18:55.222 --> 18:57.974
The beggar's
fucking psycho, man.

18:58.975 --> 19:02.687
But he's a mate, you know,
so what can you do?

19:02.771 --> 19:04.481
Can I borrow this?

19:04.564 --> 19:06.691
<i>What indeed could one do?</i>

19:06.775 --> 19:09.486
<i>Just stand back and watch
and try not to get involved.</i>

19:11.363 --> 19:14.282
<i>Begbie didn't do drugs, either.
He just did people.</i>

19:14.408 --> 19:18.203
<i>That's what he got off on.
His own sensory addiction.</i>

19:20.414 --> 19:22.416
Nobody move!

19:23.750 --> 19:25.001
That lassie got glassed,

19:25.085 --> 19:28.255
and no cunt leaves here till
we find out what cunt did it.

19:28.380 --> 19:29.881
Who the fuck are you?

19:30.006 --> 19:32.217
Yes!

19:32.342 --> 19:34.052
Ohh!

19:50.902 --> 19:53.947
Oh, Tom!
Oh, my God!

19:57.284 --> 19:59.870
Oh, Lizzy!

19:59.953 --> 20:02.247
Oh, Tom, come in me!

20:02.372 --> 20:03.540
<i>And as I sat watching</i>

20:03.623 --> 20:06.001
<i>the intimate
and highly personal video,</i>

20:06.126 --> 20:09.296
<i>stolen only hours earlier
from one of my best friends,</i>

20:09.421 --> 20:11.423
<i>I realized
that something important</i>

20:11.548 --> 20:14.468
<i>was missing from my life.</i>

20:16.136 --> 20:18.930
<i># Leave no track #</i>

20:19.890 --> 20:21.391
<i># Don't look back #</i>

20:21.516 --> 20:23.810
<i># All I desire #</i>

20:23.935 --> 20:25.187
<i># Temptation #</i>

20:59.596 --> 21:01.181
I read it in "Cosmopolitan. "

21:01.306 --> 21:02.849
It's an interesting theory.

21:02.974 --> 21:04.518
Actually, it's a nightmare.

21:04.643 --> 21:06.103
I've been desperate for a shag,

21:06.186 --> 21:09.439
but watching him suffer
was just too much fun.

21:09.523 --> 21:11.149
You should try it with Tommy.

21:11.233 --> 21:14.611
What, and deny myself the only
pleasure I get from him?

21:14.694 --> 21:16.238
Did I tell you about
my birthday?

21:16.363 --> 21:17.072
What happened?

21:17.197 --> 21:19.658
He forgot.
Useless motherfucker.

21:46.768 --> 21:49.271
What are you two talking about?

21:49.646 --> 21:51.189
Football!

21:51.314 --> 21:52.691
What are you talking about?

21:52.774 --> 21:54.192
Shopping.

21:55.277 --> 21:57.738
<i>The situation
was becoming serious.</i>

21:57.863 --> 22:01.032
<i>Young Renton noticed the haste
with which the successful,</i>

22:01.158 --> 22:03.076
<i>in the sexual sphere,
as in all others,</i>

22:03.160 --> 22:06.121
<i>segregated themselves
from the failures.</i>

22:06.246 --> 22:08.290
<i># I can't break away #</i>

22:08.415 --> 22:11.835
<i># Keep us from temptation #</i>

22:11.960 --> 22:15.505
<i># Keep us from temptation #</i>

22:15.589 --> 22:18.133
<i>Heroin had robbed Renton
of his sex drive,</i>

22:18.258 --> 22:20.761
<i>but now it returned
with a vengeance.</i>

22:20.886 --> 22:24.055
<i>And as the impotence of
those days faded into memory,</i>

22:24.181 --> 22:27.851
<i>grim desperation took a hold
in his sex-crazed mind.</i>

22:27.934 --> 22:31.396
<i>His post-junk libido, fueled
by alcohol and amphetamine,</i>

22:31.521 --> 22:35.442
<i>taunted him remorselessly with
his own unsatisfied desire.</i>

22:35.567 --> 22:38.111
<i>Dot, dot, dot.</i>

22:38.236 --> 22:39.905
<i># You think
that you're right now #</i>

22:40.030 --> 22:41.239
<i># Temptation #</i>

22:41.323 --> 22:43.450
<i># You're gonna face it
tonight now #</i>

22:43.575 --> 22:45.035
<i># Temptation #</i>

22:45.118 --> 22:47.370
<i># Oh, give me a breakdown #</i>

22:47.454 --> 22:48.747
<i># Temptation #</i>

22:48.830 --> 22:51.291
<i># Because it's time
for a shakedown #</i>

22:51.374 --> 22:57.255
<i># Temptation #</i>

23:35.127 --> 23:39.631
<i>And with that,
Mark Renton had fallen in love.</i>

23:48.890 --> 23:50.642
Excuse me,
I don't mean to harass you,

23:50.767 --> 23:53.270
but I was very impressed
with the capable manner

23:53.353 --> 23:54.855
in which you dealt with that.

23:54.980 --> 23:57.399
I was thinking to myself,
"This girl's special. "

23:57.524 --> 23:58.483
Thanks.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.485
- What's your name?
- Diane.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.654
- Where are you going, Diane?
- I'm going home.

24:02.779 --> 24:04.489
- Where's that?
- It's where you live.

24:04.614 --> 24:05.532
Great.

24:05.657 --> 24:06.742
What?

24:06.867 --> 24:10.287
I'll come back with you,
but I'm not promising anything.

24:10.370 --> 24:12.789
Do you find that this approach
usually works?

24:12.873 --> 24:15.375
Or, let me guess,
you've never tried it before.

24:15.459 --> 24:18.503
In fact, you don't normally
approach girls, am I right?

24:18.628 --> 24:21.548
The truth is that you're
a quiet, sensitive type,

24:21.631 --> 24:23.467
but if I'm prepared to
take a chance,

24:23.550 --> 24:25.719
I might just get to know
the inner you.

24:25.844 --> 24:30.223
Witty, adventurous, passionate,
loving, loyal.

24:30.348 --> 24:32.225
Taxi!

24:32.350 --> 24:34.728
A little bit crazy,
a little bit bad.

24:34.853 --> 24:38.815
But, hey, don't us girls
just love that?

24:41.193 --> 24:43.070
Well, what's wrong, boy?

24:43.195 --> 24:44.654
Cat got your tongue?

24:44.738 --> 24:46.823
I left something.

24:47.783 --> 24:49.826
Are you getting in or not, pal?

25:10.972 --> 25:13.016
Do you understand?

25:13.100 --> 25:16.395
I expect you to be a considerate
and thoughtful lover.

25:16.478 --> 25:18.522
Generous but firm.

25:18.605 --> 25:19.356
What?

25:19.439 --> 25:22.776
Failure on your part to live up
to these reasonable expectations

25:22.901 --> 25:27.489
will result in swift resumption
of a non-sex situation.

25:27.614 --> 25:28.907
Right?

25:41.503 --> 25:42.754
Diane.

25:42.879 --> 25:43.922
Shh!

25:44.047 --> 25:44.673
What?

25:44.798 --> 25:46.925
Shut up!

26:27.257 --> 26:29.134
Wake up, Spud.

26:29.676 --> 26:31.261
Wake up.

26:31.344 --> 26:33.138
Sex.

26:34.431 --> 26:36.308
Casual sex.

26:43.607 --> 26:46.318
Tommy, let's put the tape on.

26:46.401 --> 26:47.360
Now?

26:47.486 --> 26:50.155
I want to watch ourselves
while we're screwing.

26:50.238 --> 26:52.991
So let's see what I'm missing.

27:07.839 --> 27:09.466
Not much.

27:11.510 --> 27:12.803
Pushed forward again.

27:12.886 --> 27:14.846
And there's the captain,
Archie Gemmill,

27:14.930 --> 27:16.890
picking it up from the outside.

27:16.973 --> 27:18.392
I think he wants to go himself.

27:18.517 --> 27:20.685
He's gonna go.
He's going all the way.

27:20.811 --> 27:22.187
And he scores!

27:22.270 --> 27:24.981
Oh, what a magnificent goal!

27:25.065 --> 27:27.192
Gemmill at his very best!

27:27.275 --> 27:30.362
What a penetrating goal
that was!

27:30.487 --> 27:32.155
I haven't felt that good

27:32.239 --> 27:35.659
since Archie Gemmill scored
against Holland in 1978.

27:39.454 --> 27:40.914
You can't sleep here.

27:41.039 --> 27:43.250
- What?
- Out.

27:43.375 --> 27:44.543
Come on!

27:44.668 --> 27:47.379
No argument. You can sleep on
the sofa in the hall or go home.

27:47.462 --> 27:48.880
It's up to you.

27:50.257 --> 27:52.676
And don't make any noise.

27:53.593 --> 27:55.262
Jesus!

28:01.810 --> 28:03.687
What do you mean, "It's gone"?

28:03.770 --> 28:07.482
- Where has it gone, Tommy?
- It'll be here somewhere!

28:09.067 --> 28:11.278
I might have returned it
by mistake.

28:11.403 --> 28:12.404
Returned it?

28:12.529 --> 28:16.366
Where?
The video shop, Tommy?

28:16.450 --> 28:19.077
The fucking video shop?

28:19.161 --> 28:23.540
So every punter in Edinburgh
is jerking off to our video?

28:24.124 --> 28:27.294
Oh, God, Tommy, I feel sick.

28:51.109 --> 28:53.070
<i># Oh, you've got green eyes #</i>

28:53.153 --> 28:54.696
<i># Oh, you've got blue eyes #</i>

28:54.821 --> 28:57.616
<i># Oh, you've got gray eyes #</i>

28:57.741 --> 29:01.244
<i># And I've never seen anyone #</i>

29:01.328 --> 29:02.079
Hi.

29:02.162 --> 29:04.206
Hello.

29:04.331 --> 29:07.626
<i># No, I've never met anyone #</i>

29:07.751 --> 29:10.253
<i># Quite like you before #</i>

29:11.129 --> 29:12.547
Fuck.

29:35.821 --> 29:36.488
Eh?

29:47.958 --> 29:49.960
Come in and sit down.

29:50.043 --> 29:51.795
Like some coffee?

29:51.878 --> 29:52.671
Aye.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.007
You must be Mark.

29:56.133 --> 29:57.717
Aye, that's me.

30:03.265 --> 30:04.891
You're a friend of Diane's?

30:05.016 --> 30:06.685
More of a friend
of a friend, no?

30:06.768 --> 30:07.894
Right.

30:10.397 --> 30:12.482
Are you her flatmates, like?

30:14.151 --> 30:16.027
Flatmates?

30:16.153 --> 30:17.988
I must remember that one.

30:19.364 --> 30:20.949
Morning.

30:35.881 --> 30:37.466
Good morning, Spud.

30:37.591 --> 30:40.719
Gail.
Mr. Houston, Mrs. Houston.

30:40.802 --> 30:43.889
Good morning, Spud. Sit down
and have some breakfast.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.393
I'm sorry about last night,
by the way.

30:48.518 --> 30:51.605
That's all right.
I slept fine on the sofa.

30:52.689 --> 30:56.568
I had a bit much to drink.
I had a bit of an accident.

30:56.651 --> 30:58.695
Don't worry, son.
These things happen.

30:58.779 --> 31:02.074
It does a man good to cut loose
once in a while.

31:02.157 --> 31:05.077
This one could do with being
tied up once in a while.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.912
I'll put the sheets
in the machine.

31:06.995 --> 31:09.081
No, no, no, I'll wash them.

31:09.164 --> 31:10.916
- There's no need.
- It's no problem.

31:11.041 --> 31:12.042
It's no problem for me.

31:12.125 --> 31:13.752
I'd rather take care
of it myself.

31:13.877 --> 31:15.087
Honestly, it's no problem.

31:15.170 --> 31:16.088
Really, no!

31:16.213 --> 31:18.423
Spud, they're my sheets!

31:31.019 --> 31:32.104
I don't see why not.

31:32.187 --> 31:33.897
Because it's illegal.
That's why not.

31:33.980 --> 31:35.065
What? Holding hands?

31:35.148 --> 31:36.274
Not holding hands.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.943
In that case, you can do it.

31:38.068 --> 31:40.362
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.

31:40.487 --> 31:41.988
Yeah, and that's what's illegal.

31:42.114 --> 31:43.657
Do you know what they'd do
to me inside?

31:43.782 --> 31:46.159
They cut your balls off and
flush them down the toilet.

31:46.284 --> 31:48.245
Calm down.
You're not going to jail.

31:48.370 --> 31:50.622
Well, that's very easy
for you to say, Diane.

31:50.705 --> 31:53.625
- Can I see you again?
- Certainly not!

31:53.708 --> 31:57.087
If you don't see me again,
I'll tell the police.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.883
I'll see you around then.

32:14.896 --> 32:16.481
Now what?

32:17.107 --> 32:18.150
We're going for a walk.

32:18.275 --> 32:19.276
What?

32:19.359 --> 32:21.027
A walk!

32:21.987 --> 32:22.946
Where?

32:23.071 --> 32:24.614
There!

32:25.991 --> 32:28.160
Are you serious?

33:01.735 --> 33:03.945
Well, what are you waiting for?

33:04.446 --> 33:05.697
Tommy.

33:07.616 --> 33:09.534
This is not natural, man.

33:10.202 --> 33:12.746
It's the great outdoors!

33:12.871 --> 33:14.414
It's fresh air.

33:14.539 --> 33:17.542
Look, Tommy, we know you're
getting a hard time off Lizzy,

33:17.667 --> 33:20.545
but there's really no need
to take it out on us.

33:20.629 --> 33:22.589
Doesn't it make you proud
to be Scottish?

33:22.714 --> 33:25.550
It's shite being Scottish!

33:25.634 --> 33:27.761
We're the lowest of the low.

33:27.886 --> 33:30.222
The scum of the fucking Earth.

33:30.305 --> 33:32.724
The most wretched,
miserable, servile,

33:32.849 --> 33:36.436
pathetic trash that was ever
shat into civilization.

33:36.561 --> 33:38.438
Some people hate the English.
I don't.

33:38.563 --> 33:40.232
They're just wankers.

33:40.315 --> 33:43.902
We, on the other hand,
are colonized by wankers.

33:44.027 --> 33:48.031
We can't even find a decent
culture to be colonized by.

33:48.156 --> 33:50.909
We're ruled by effete arseholes.

33:51.034 --> 33:53.203
It's a shite state of affairs
to be in, Tommy,

33:53.286 --> 33:54.704
and all the fresh air
in the world

33:54.788 --> 33:57.499
won't make any fucking
difference!

34:06.633 --> 34:08.342
Sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

34:08.467 --> 34:11.221
No, I appreciate it, Tommy.

34:11.304 --> 34:12.806
<i>At or around this time,</i>

34:12.889 --> 34:15.391
<i>Spud, Sick Boy, and I made
a healthy, informed,</i>

34:15.475 --> 34:19.146
<i>Democratic decision to get back
on heroin as soon as possible.</i>

34:19.271 --> 34:21.440
<i>It took about 12 hours.</i>

34:26.069 --> 34:28.612
<i>It looks easy, this,
but it's not.</i>

34:28.739 --> 34:31.533
<i>It looks like a doss,
like a soft option.</i>

34:31.658 --> 34:36.496
<i>But living like this,
it's a full-time business.</i>

34:54.973 --> 34:57.642
Ursula Andress.

34:57.768 --> 35:00.020
The quintessential Bond Girl.

35:00.145 --> 35:02.189
That's what everyone says.

35:02.314 --> 35:06.485
The embodiment, right,
of his superiority to us.

35:06.610 --> 35:09.988
Beautiful, exotic,
highly sexual,

35:10.113 --> 35:15.327
yet totally unavailable
to anyone apart from him.

35:15.452 --> 35:16.578
Shite.

35:16.703 --> 35:18.205
I mean, let's face it, mate.

35:18.330 --> 35:20.082
She'd shag one punter
from Edinburgh,

35:20.207 --> 35:22.292
she'd shag
the whole fucking lot of us.

35:33.720 --> 35:35.180
Well done.

35:35.263 --> 35:38.350
I knew he was gonna do that.

35:47.692 --> 35:49.319
Lizzy's gone, Mark.

35:49.403 --> 35:52.364
She's gone
and fucking dumped me.

35:52.447 --> 35:55.534
It was that videotape

35:55.659 --> 35:57.244
and that Iggy Pop business

35:57.369 --> 35:59.204
and other sorts of shit.

35:59.287 --> 36:03.250
She told me where to go
and no fucking mistake.

36:03.375 --> 36:05.335
I said to her,

36:05.419 --> 36:07.212
"Is there any chance
of getting back together?"

36:07.337 --> 36:10.424
But no way, no fucking way.

36:10.549 --> 36:16.054
Honor Blackman, A.K.A.
Pussy Galore, right?

36:16.179 --> 36:19.558
What a total fucking misnomer.

36:20.100 --> 36:23.395
I mean, I wouldn't touch her
with yours.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.772
I want to try it, Mark.

36:26.773 --> 36:29.609
You're always going on about how
it's the ultimate hit.

36:29.735 --> 36:31.611
Better than sex.

36:35.323 --> 36:37.117
Come on, man,
I'm a fucking adult.

36:37.242 --> 36:39.703
I can find out for myself.

36:44.458 --> 36:45.959
I've got the money.

36:49.212 --> 36:52.758
Personality. I mean,
that's what counts, right?

36:52.883 --> 36:53.759
Personality.

36:53.884 --> 36:57.471
That's what keeps a relationship
going through the years.

36:59.139 --> 37:00.891
Like heroin.

37:01.349 --> 37:07.397
I mean, heroin's got great
fucking personality.

37:07.481 --> 37:09.232
<i># Nightclubbing #</i>

37:09.316 --> 37:12.319
<i># We're nightclubbing #</i>

37:12.402 --> 37:15.489
<i># We're walking through town #</i>

37:17.824 --> 37:20.619
<i># Nightclubbing #</i>

37:20.702 --> 37:21.620
<i>Swanney taught us</i>

37:21.745 --> 37:23.914
<i>to respect
the National Health Service,</i>

37:23.997 --> 37:26.291
<i>for it was the source
of much of our gear.</i>

37:26.374 --> 37:29.461
<i>We stole drugs, we stole
prescriptions, or bought them,</i>

37:29.586 --> 37:32.923
<i>sold them, swapped them,
forged them, photocopied them,</i>

37:33.006 --> 37:35.634
<i>or traded drugs with
cancer victims, alcoholics,</i>

37:35.717 --> 37:38.762
<i>old-age pensioners,
AIDS patients, epileptics,</i>

37:38.845 --> 37:40.263
<i>and bored housewives.</i>

37:40.347 --> 37:43.809
<i>We took morphine, diamorphine,
cyclizine, codeine,</i>

37:43.934 --> 37:46.436
<i>temazepam, nitrazepam,
phenobarbitone,</i>

37:46.561 --> 37:49.356
<i>sodium amytal,
dextropropo xyphene, methadone,</i>

37:49.481 --> 37:52.776
<i>nalbuphine, pethidine,
pentazocine, buprenorphine,</i>

37:52.859 --> 37:54.861
<i>dextromoramide,
chlormethiazole.</i>

37:54.986 --> 37:57.697
<i>The streets are awash
with drugs you can have</i>

37:57.823 --> 38:00.826
<i>for unhappiness and pain,
and we took them all.</i>

38:00.951 --> 38:03.036
<i>Fuck it, we would have injected
vitamin C</i>

38:03.161 --> 38:05.038
<i>if only they'd made it illegal.</i>

38:14.214 --> 38:16.258
Pardon me,
may I use your bathroom?

38:16.383 --> 38:18.051
Thank you.

38:29.604 --> 38:31.398
You're a psycho!

38:41.366 --> 38:44.828
Hey, Rent Boy, no fucking smack.

38:49.708 --> 38:52.169
<i>But the good times
couldn't last forever.</i>

38:52.252 --> 38:55.714
No! God, no!

38:55.797 --> 38:59.676
Oh, my God, no!
Please, no!

38:59.760 --> 39:02.554
<i>I think Allison
had been screaming all day,</i>

39:02.679 --> 39:05.057
<i>but it hadn't really
registered before.</i>

39:05.766 --> 39:08.477
<i>She might have been screaming
for a week for all I knew.</i>

39:08.602 --> 39:10.437
<i>It had been days
since I heard anyone speak,</i>

39:10.562 --> 39:13.523
<i>though someone must have said
something in all that time.</i>

39:13.607 --> 39:15.400
<i>Surely to fuck,
someone must have.</i>

39:15.484 --> 39:18.153
- Allison! Allison!
- Help me, please!

39:18.278 --> 39:19.446
Calm down!

39:19.571 --> 39:22.741
Everything's going to be
just fine.

39:22.824 --> 39:25.619
<i>Nothing could have been further
from the truth.</i>

39:25.744 --> 39:28.330
<i>In point of fact, nothing was
going to be just fine.</i>

39:28.455 --> 39:31.249
<i>On the contrary,
everything was going to be bad.</i>

39:31.374 --> 39:33.043
<i>Bad?</i>

39:33.126 --> 39:36.713
<i>I mean everything was gonna be
even worse than it already was.</i>

39:44.638 --> 39:47.391
No!

39:54.314 --> 39:56.191
Fuck.

39:56.316 --> 39:57.984
Jesus Christ!

39:58.110 --> 40:00.570
No!
No!

40:03.198 --> 40:05.617
<i>It wasn't my baby.</i>

40:05.700 --> 40:07.119
<i>She wasn't my baby.</i>

40:07.244 --> 40:09.162
<i>Baby Dawn, she wasn't mine.</i>

40:09.287 --> 40:11.790
<i>Spud's? Swanney's?
Sick Boy's?</i>

40:11.915 --> 40:13.792
<i>I don't know.</i>

40:13.917 --> 40:16.711
<i>Maybe Allison knew.
Maybe not.</i>

40:16.837 --> 40:19.756
<i>I wished I could think of
something to say,</i>

40:19.840 --> 40:22.759
<i>something sympathetic,
something human.</i>

40:22.843 --> 40:25.053
Say something, Mark.

40:27.722 --> 40:30.976
Fucking say something!

40:36.648 --> 40:38.817
I'm cooking up.

40:55.709 --> 40:58.003
Cook us up a shot, Rents.

40:58.128 --> 41:00.630
I need a hit.

41:01.506 --> 41:04.384
<i>And so she did.
I could understand that.</i>

41:04.509 --> 41:06.762
<i>To take the pain away.</i>

41:07.929 --> 41:10.807
<i>So I cooked up,
and she got a hit.</i>

41:10.891 --> 41:12.893
<i>But only after me.</i>

41:12.976 --> 41:15.270
<i>That went without saying.</i>

41:17.064 --> 41:19.983
<i>Well, at least we knew
who the father was now.</i>

41:20.067 --> 41:22.444
<i>It wasn't just the baby
that died that day.</i>

41:22.569 --> 41:26.448
<i>Something inside Sick Boy
was lost and never returned.</i>

41:26.573 --> 41:27.866
<i>It seemed he had no theory</i>

41:27.991 --> 41:30.077
<i>with which to explain a moment
like this.</i>

41:30.202 --> 41:32.037
<i>Nor did I.</i>

41:32.162 --> 41:35.207
<i>Our only response was to keep
on going and fuck everything.</i>

41:35.332 --> 41:37.375
<i>Pile misery upon misery,</i>

41:37.501 --> 41:39.961
<i>heap it up on a spoon
and dissolve it with bile,</i>

41:40.087 --> 41:42.339
<i>then squirt it into a stinking,
purulent vein,</i>

41:42.422 --> 41:44.216
<i>and do it all over again.</i>

41:44.299 --> 41:46.426
<i>Keep on going, getting up,
going out, robbing,</i>

41:46.551 --> 41:48.053
<i>stealing, fucking people over,</i>

41:48.178 --> 41:49.721
<i>propelling ourselves
with longing</i>

41:49.846 --> 41:52.349
<i>towards the day
that it would all go wrong.</i>

41:52.432 --> 41:55.644
<i>Because no matter how much you
stash or how much you steal,</i>

41:55.769 --> 41:57.104
<i>you never have enough.</i>

41:57.229 --> 41:59.898
<i>No matter how often you go out
and rob and fuck people over,</i>

42:00.023 --> 42:03.193
<i>you always need to get up
and do it all over again.</i>

42:06.488 --> 42:10.951
<i>Sooner or later, this kind
of thing was bound to happen.</i>

42:16.498 --> 42:19.042
Because shoplifting
is theft, which is a crime,

42:19.126 --> 42:20.710
and despite
what you may believe,

42:20.836 --> 42:23.630
there is no such entity
as victimless crime.

42:23.755 --> 42:25.298
Heroin addiction
may explain your actions,

42:25.424 --> 42:27.259
but it does not excuse them.

42:27.342 --> 42:29.553
Mr. Murphy,
you are a habitual thief,

42:29.636 --> 42:31.638
devoid of regret and remorse.

42:31.721 --> 42:33.765
In sentencing you
to six months imprisonment,

42:33.890 --> 42:37.352
my only worry is it will not
be long before we meet again.

42:37.477 --> 42:40.063
Mr. Renton, I understand
that you have entered

42:40.147 --> 42:41.940
into a program of rehabilitation

42:42.065 --> 42:45.152
in an attempt to wean yourself
away from heroin.

42:45.277 --> 42:47.821
The suspension of your sentence

42:47.946 --> 42:51.199
is conditional on your continued
cooperation with this program.

42:51.324 --> 42:53.285
Should you stand guilty
before me again,

42:53.368 --> 42:56.663
I shall not hesitate to impose
a custodial sentence.

42:56.788 --> 42:58.999
Thank you, Your Honor.

42:59.124 --> 43:03.044
With God's help, I'll conquer
this terrible affliction.

43:17.768 --> 43:19.269
<i>What can you say?</i>

43:19.352 --> 43:21.772
<i>Well,
Begbie had a phrase for it.</i>

43:21.855 --> 43:24.483
It was obvious that cunt
was going to fuck some cunt.

43:24.608 --> 43:26.985
Well, I hope you learnt
your lesson, son.

43:27.069 --> 43:30.822
Oh, my son, I thought
I was gonna lose you there.

43:30.947 --> 43:35.494
You're nothing but trouble
to me, but I still love you!

43:35.619 --> 43:38.997
You better clean up your act.
Cut that shite out forever.

43:39.122 --> 43:41.333
You listen to Francis.
He's talking sense.

43:41.416 --> 43:42.501
Fucking right I am.

43:42.626 --> 43:45.629
See, inside, you wouldn't last
two fucking days.

43:45.712 --> 43:48.215
There's better things
than the needle, Rents.

43:48.340 --> 43:49.216
Choose life.

43:49.341 --> 43:51.343
I remember
when you were a wee baby.

43:51.468 --> 43:53.428
Oh, mama's little baby loves.

43:53.553 --> 43:55.013
<i># Shortening, shortening #</i>

43:55.138 --> 43:58.016
<i># Mama's little baby loves
shortening bread #</i>

44:10.695 --> 44:13.490
I'm sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

44:13.573 --> 44:16.701
That wasn't any fair.
Spud going down and not me.

44:19.037 --> 44:20.997
Well, it's not our fault!

44:22.374 --> 44:24.709
Your boy went down
because he was a smack-head,

44:24.835 --> 44:28.130
and if that's not your fault,
then I don't know what is.

44:30.132 --> 44:33.218
That was that fucking cunt.

44:36.263 --> 44:37.389
I'll get the drinks.

44:37.514 --> 44:39.433
Aye.

44:41.435 --> 44:43.770
<i>I wished I'd gone down
instead of Spud.</i>

44:43.895 --> 44:47.858
<i>Here I was surrounded by my
family and my so-called mates,</i>

44:47.983 --> 44:51.611
<i>and I've never felt so alone,
never in all my puff.</i>

44:54.698 --> 44:57.200
<i>Since I was on remand,
they've had me on this program.</i>

44:57.325 --> 44:59.453
<i>The state-sponsored addiction.</i>

44:59.578 --> 45:01.204
<i>Three sickly sweet doses</i>

45:01.288 --> 45:03.582
<i>of methadone a day
instead of smack.</i>

45:03.707 --> 45:06.084
<i>But it's never enough.</i>

45:06.209 --> 45:09.129
<i>And at the moment,
it's nowhere near enough.</i>

45:09.963 --> 45:11.256
<i>I took all three this morning,</i>

45:11.339 --> 45:13.925
<i>and now I've got 18 hours
to go till my next shot</i>

45:14.009 --> 45:17.637
<i>and a sweat on my back
like a layer of frost.</i>

45:17.763 --> 45:21.641
<i>I need to visit the Mother
Superior for one hit.</i>

45:21.767 --> 45:27.689
<i>One fucking hit to get us
over this long, hard day.</i>

45:30.942 --> 45:32.527
What's on the menu
this evening, sir?

45:32.652 --> 45:35.447
- Your favorite dish.
- Excellent.

45:35.572 --> 45:38.116
- Usual table, sir?
- Oh, why, thank you.

45:38.241 --> 45:41.453
Would sir care to pay
for his bill in advance?

45:41.536 --> 45:43.121
No, stick it on my tab.

45:43.246 --> 45:44.456
Regret to inform, sir,

45:44.539 --> 45:47.626
credit limit was reached and
breached quite some time ago.

45:47.751 --> 45:50.087
Oh, well, in that case.

45:50.545 --> 45:52.756
Hard currency!
That'll do nicely.

45:52.839 --> 45:56.259
Can't be too careful when we're
dealing with your type, can we?

45:57.344 --> 46:00.305
Would sir care for a starter?
Some garlic bread perhaps?

46:00.388 --> 46:02.724
No, thank you.
I'll proceed directly

46:02.849 --> 46:05.769
to the intravenous injection
of hard drugs, please.

46:06.353 --> 46:08.105
As you wish, sir.

46:08.188 --> 46:10.607
As you wish.

46:56.194 --> 47:00.115
<i># Just a perfect day #</i>

47:00.240 --> 47:04.703
<i># Drink sangria in the park #</i>

47:04.828 --> 47:06.997
<i># And then later #</i>

47:07.080 --> 47:10.208
Perhaps sir would like me
to call for a taxi?

47:16.256 --> 47:20.051
<i># Just a perfect day #</i>

47:20.135 --> 47:24.389
<i># Feed animals in the zoo #</i>

<i># Then later a movie, too,
and then home #</i>

47:34.107 --> 47:39.529

47:39.613 --> 47:43.158

<i># Just a perfect day #</i>

<i># Problems all left alone #</i>

<i># Just a perfect day #</i>

48:27.702 --> 48:31.581
<i># You made me forget myself #</i>

48:32.624 --> 48:36.086
<i># I thought
I was someone else #</i>

48:36.169 --> 48:38.463
<i># Someone good #</i>

48:41.174 --> 48:46.138
<i># Oh, it's such a perfect day #</i>

48:46.221 --> 48:52.185
<i># I'm glad

48:52.310 --> 48:55.439
<i># Oh, such a perfect day #</i>

<i># You just keep me hanging on #</i>

49:00.277 --> 49:06.283
<i># You just keep me hanging on #</i>

49:20.172 --> 49:22.382
Open your eyes!
Wake up!

49:22.507 --> 49:24.134
Come on, wake up!

49:24.217 --> 49:27.679
<i># Just what you sow #</i>

<i>I don't feel the sickness yet,</i>

50:56.643 --> 50:59.104
<i>but it's in the post,

50:59.938 --> 51:02.482
<i>I'm in the junky limbo
at the moment.</i>

51:02.607 --> 51:06.737
<i>Too ill to sleep,
too tired to stay awake.</i>

51:06.862 --> 51:09.865
<i>But the sickness is on its way.</i>

51:09.948 --> 51:14.161
<i>Sweat, chills, nausea, pain,
and craving.</i>

51:14.286 --> 51:15.912
<i>Need like nothing else
I've ever known</i>

51:16.037 --> 51:17.956

52:00.957 --> 52:03.835
We'll help you, son.

52:03.919 --> 52:06.838
You'll stay here with us
till you get better.

52:06.963 --> 52:09.132
We're gonna beat this together.

52:09.216 --> 52:12.010
Maybe I should go back
to the clinic.

52:12.135 --> 52:13.095
No.

52:13.220 --> 52:16.473
No clinics, no methadone.

52:16.556 --> 52:19.684
That only made you worse.
You said so yourself.

52:20.852 --> 52:25.690
You lied to us, son,
your own mother and father.

52:25.816 --> 52:28.819
- You could bring us jellies.
- No!

52:28.902 --> 52:30.570
You're worse coming off that
than heroin.

52:30.695 --> 52:33.156
- Nothing at all.
- It's a clean break this time.

52:33.240 --> 52:35.700
You're staying here where
we can keep an eye on you.

52:35.784 --> 52:37.411
I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

52:37.536 --> 52:39.996
But I just need one more score.

52:40.122 --> 52:43.208
Just bring me one more hit.

52:43.333 --> 52:46.336
I need one more fucking hit!

52:47.629 --> 52:49.548
You fuck!

52:52.092 --> 52:55.804
Hit.

53:08.024 --> 53:13.238
Well, this is a good
fucking laugh, ain't it?

53:13.363 --> 53:15.824
You sweat that shite
out of your system,

53:15.907 --> 53:18.535
'cause if I come back
and it's still here,

53:18.660 --> 53:21.747
I'll fucking kick it out.

53:21.872 --> 53:23.540
Okay.

53:32.466 --> 53:33.925
God.

53:49.775 --> 53:51.401
Question number one.

53:51.485 --> 53:54.571
The human immunodeficiency virus
is a...

53:54.696 --> 53:56.239
Retrovirus?

53:56.323 --> 53:58.825
Retrovirus is the right answer!

54:08.418 --> 54:11.671
It's a mug's game, Mrs. Renton.

54:11.797 --> 54:14.633
I mean, I'm not saying
I was blameless myself.

54:14.758 --> 54:17.260
But there comes a time

54:17.385 --> 54:19.387
when you have to turn your back
on that nonsense

54:19.471 --> 54:21.598
and just say no.

54:25.894 --> 54:28.105
Just say no.

54:28.230 --> 54:31.066
She's gone!
She's gone!

54:42.619 --> 54:44.079
Fuck.

54:59.428 --> 55:00.971
Question number two.

55:01.096 --> 55:05.517
H.I.V. binds to which receptor
on the host lymphocyte?

55:05.642 --> 55:07.811
Which receptor is that?

55:07.936 --> 55:11.356
<i># I'm gonna try,
I'm gonna try #</i>

55:11.481 --> 55:14.568
<i># I'm gonna try,
I'm gonna try #</i>

55:14.693 --> 55:15.861
CD4.

55:15.986 --> 55:18.864
CD4 is the right answer!

55:22.409 --> 55:24.870
Better than sex, Rents.

55:24.995 --> 55:27.456
Better than sex.

55:27.539 --> 55:29.791
The ultimate hit.

55:30.542 --> 55:33.837
I'm a fucking adult.
I can find out for myself.

55:34.838 --> 55:37.716
Well, I'm finding out,
all right.

55:43.138 --> 55:45.182
Tommy.

55:47.017 --> 55:48.602
No!

55:48.727 --> 55:50.353
Stop it.
Fucking stop it.

55:50.437 --> 55:51.688
Stop it.
Stop it.

55:51.772 --> 55:55.400
Is he guilty or not guilty?

55:58.820 --> 56:00.739
He's our son.

56:07.162 --> 56:08.121
Don't!

56:08.246 --> 56:09.122
Don't!

56:09.247 --> 56:12.084
Don't!

56:12.209 --> 56:14.294
Stop!

56:15.253 --> 56:17.297
Oh, my God!

56:19.007 --> 56:20.425
Stop!

56:26.681 --> 56:30.811
Mark.

56:31.770 --> 56:33.355
Mark.

56:36.608 --> 56:38.944
There's something
you need to do.

56:58.964 --> 56:59.756
Ow!

57:08.056 --> 57:10.475
Come alive, 35.

57:10.559 --> 57:13.437
Lots of tricks, 66.

57:14.312 --> 57:17.441
Mark, you've got a house!

57:17.524 --> 57:19.985
House!
House!

57:20.110 --> 57:22.571
For goodness sake, Mark.

57:23.155 --> 57:26.074
<i>It seems I really am
the luckiest guy in the world.</i>

57:26.158 --> 57:28.535
<i>Several years of addiction
in the middle of an epidemic,</i>

57:28.660 --> 57:30.912
<i>surrounded by the living dead.</i>

57:30.996 --> 57:33.623
<i>But not me.
I'm negative.</i>

57:33.749 --> 57:35.375
<i>It's official.</i>

57:36.251 --> 57:39.254
<i>Once the pain goes away,
the real battle starts.</i>

57:39.337 --> 57:41.256
<i>Depression.
Boredom.</i>

57:41.339 --> 57:44.718
<i>You feel so fucking low, you'll
want to fucking top yourself.</i>

57:47.846 --> 57:49.723
Tommy!

57:49.848 --> 57:51.183
Tommy!

57:55.312 --> 57:57.856
Tommy, it's Mark, man.

58:05.989 --> 58:07.866
Renton.

58:30.347 --> 58:31.765
Getting out much, Tommy?

58:31.890 --> 58:33.475
No.

58:37.062 --> 58:39.064
Following the game at all?

58:39.147 --> 58:40.941
No.

58:42.484 --> 58:44.820
Nah, me neither, really.

58:55.122 --> 58:57.290
You take the test?

58:58.875 --> 59:00.710
Aye.

59:02.546 --> 59:04.506
Clear?

59:05.257 --> 59:06.716
Aye.

59:08.635 --> 59:10.804
That's nice.

59:13.265 --> 59:15.642
I'm sorry, Tommy.

59:17.936 --> 59:19.813
Got any gear on you?

59:20.981 --> 59:23.024
No, I'm clean, man.

59:23.942 --> 59:27.988
Well, sub us, then, mate.

59:29.114 --> 59:30.907
I'm expecting a rent check.

59:45.422 --> 59:46.923
Thanks, Mark.

59:47.549 --> 59:49.509
No bother.

59:53.430 --> 59:56.266
<i>No bother, none at all.</i>

59:56.349 --> 59:57.851
<i>Not for me, anyway.</i>

59:57.976 --> 59:59.936
<i>It's easy to be philosophical</i>

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.106
<i>when it's some other poor cunt
with shite for blood.</i>

01:00:10.906 --> 01:00:12.616
What do you want?

01:00:12.699 --> 01:00:14.534
- Are you clean?
- Yes.

01:00:14.659 --> 01:00:16.286
Is that a promise, then?

01:00:16.411 --> 01:00:17.829
Yes, it is.

01:00:17.913 --> 01:00:20.874
Calm down.
I'm only asking.

01:00:24.336 --> 01:00:27.214
- Is that hash I can smell?
- No.

01:00:27.339 --> 01:00:28.965
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.

01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:31.510
- Well, it isn't.
- It smells like it.

01:00:31.635 --> 01:00:35.388
- You're too young.
- I'm too young for what?

01:00:43.522 --> 01:00:45.816
You're not getting
any younger, Mark.

01:00:45.899 --> 01:00:48.527
The world's changing.
Music's changing.

01:00:48.652 --> 01:00:50.195
Even drugs are changing.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.738
You can't stay in here all day

01:00:51.863 --> 01:00:54.908
dreaming about heroin
and Ziggy Pop.

01:00:55.033 --> 01:00:56.701
It's Iggy Pop.

01:00:56.827 --> 01:00:59.371
Whatever.
I mean, the guy's dead anyway.

01:00:59.496 --> 01:01:02.499
Iggy Pop is not dead.
He toured last year.

01:01:02.624 --> 01:01:06.211
The point is, you've got
to find something new.

01:01:08.296 --> 01:01:11.967
<i>She was right.
I had to find something new.</i>

01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:14.636
<i>There was only one thing
for it.</i>

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:22.853
<i># So find the feeling #</i>

01:01:25.939 --> 01:01:30.068
<i># So find the feeling #</i>

01:01:33.155 --> 01:01:37.117
<i># So find the feeling #</i>

01:01:41.079 --> 01:01:43.457
<i># Boom, diggy diggy diggy,
boom, diggy bang #</i>

01:01:57.345 --> 01:01:58.930
Lifestyle Leasing Agency.

01:01:59.055 --> 01:02:01.933
Oh, yes, it's a beautifully
converted Victorian townhouse.

01:02:02.017 --> 01:02:03.810
Ideally located in a quiet road,

01:02:03.935 --> 01:02:06.229
near to the local shops
and transport.

01:02:06.354 --> 01:02:09.316
This one's two bedrooms
and a kitchen/diner.

01:02:09.441 --> 01:02:12.027
Fully fitted in excellent
decorative order.

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.446
Lots of storage space,
and all mod cons.

01:02:14.571 --> 01:02:18.158
And it's going at?320 a week.

01:02:25.248 --> 01:02:28.418
<i>I settled in not too badly
and kept myself to myself.</i>

01:02:28.502 --> 01:02:30.128
<i>Sometimes,
I thought about the guys,</i>

01:02:30.253 --> 01:02:32.380
<i>but mainly I didn't miss them
at all.</i>

01:02:32.464 --> 01:02:34.049
<i>After all, this was Boomtown,</i>

01:02:34.132 --> 01:02:37.844
<i>where any fool could make cash
from chaos and plenty did.</i>

01:02:37.969 --> 01:02:41.723
I've got a beautifully converted
Victorian townhouse.

01:02:41.807 --> 01:02:43.475
<i>I quite enjoyed
the sound of it all.</i>

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.104
<i>Profit, loss, margins,
takeovers, lending, letting,</i>

01:02:47.229 --> 01:02:48.647
<i>subletting, subdividing,</i>

01:02:48.772 --> 01:02:51.441
<i>cheating, scamming,
fragmenting, breaking away.</i>

01:02:51.525 --> 01:02:53.318
Who's got the keys
to Telegraph Road?

01:02:53.443 --> 01:02:55.612
<i>There was no such thing as
society, and even if there was,</i>

01:02:55.737 --> 01:02:58.782
<i>I most certainly had nothing
to do with it.</i>

01:02:58.907 --> 01:03:02.702
<i>For the first time in my adult
life, I was almost content.</i>

01:03:03.954 --> 01:03:05.122
<i>"Dear Mark...</i>

01:03:05.247 --> 01:03:07.999
<i>I'm glad you've found a job
and somewhere to live.</i>

01:03:08.125 --> 01:03:09.835
<i>School is fine at the moment.</i>

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.712
<i>I'm not pregnant,
but thanks for asking.</i>

01:03:12.838 --> 01:03:15.966
<i>Your friend Sick Boy asked me
last week to work for him,</i>

01:03:16.091 --> 01:03:18.009
<i>but I told him where to go.</i>

01:03:18.135 --> 01:03:20.470
<i>I met Spud,
who sends his regards,</i>

01:03:20.554 --> 01:03:22.889
<i>or at least I think
that's what he said. "</i>

01:03:26.184 --> 01:03:27.978
<i>"No one has seen Tommy
for ages.</i>

01:03:28.103 --> 01:03:32.149
<i>And finally, Francis Begbie
has been on television a lot,</i>

01:03:32.232 --> 01:03:33.483
<i>as he is wanted by the police</i>

01:03:33.608 --> 01:03:35.318
<i>in connection
with an armed robbery</i>

01:03:35.402 --> 01:03:37.028
<i>in a jeweler's in Corstorphine.</i>

01:03:37.154 --> 01:03:40.157
<i>Take care.
Yours with love, Diane. "</i>

01:03:47.539 --> 01:03:49.624
<i>"Francis Begbie. "</i>

01:03:54.087 --> 01:03:55.589
Oh, no.

01:03:55.714 --> 01:03:58.717
Armed robbery?
With a replica?

01:03:58.842 --> 01:04:01.678
I mean, how can it be armed
robbery with a fucking replica?

01:04:01.803 --> 01:04:04.222
Fucking scandal.

01:04:04.514 --> 01:04:07.476
And the gear.
Look.

01:04:09.352 --> 01:04:12.898
Supposed to be solid silver.
It's fucking garbage.

01:04:13.023 --> 01:04:15.901
There's couples investing
all their hopes in that stuff.

01:04:15.984 --> 01:04:18.403
- It's a scandal, Franco.
- Too fucking right it is.

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:20.697
And I don't want any
pot noodles, by the way.

01:04:20.822 --> 01:04:22.866
I'm fucking Lee Marvin.

01:04:31.249 --> 01:04:32.584
Hey, Rents.

01:04:32.709 --> 01:04:36.129
<i>Begbie settled in
in no time at all.</i>

01:04:36.254 --> 01:04:38.924
I've got no fucking cigarettes.

01:04:44.346 --> 01:04:46.723
<i># We didn't have nowhere
to live #</i>

01:04:46.848 --> 01:04:49.559
All right.

01:04:49.684 --> 01:04:53.897
<i># Till someone said, "I know
this place off Burditt Road" #</i>

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.608
<i># It was on the 15th floor #</i>

01:04:56.733 --> 01:04:59.403
<i># It had a board
across the door #</i>

01:04:59.528 --> 01:05:03.949
<i># It took an hour to pry it off
and get inside #</i>

01:05:04.032 --> 01:05:06.451
<i># It smelt as if someone
had died #</i>

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:08.620
<i># The living room
was full of flies #</i>

01:05:08.745 --> 01:05:10.038
<i># The kitchen sink
was blocked #</i>

01:05:10.122 --> 01:05:11.123
It's me.

01:05:11.206 --> 01:05:13.959
<i># The bathroom sink
not there at all #</i>

01:05:14.084 --> 01:05:15.127
Franks!

01:05:15.252 --> 01:05:16.962
<i># A mess all right #</i>

01:05:17.087 --> 01:05:21.299
<i># Yes, it's Mile End #</i>

01:05:21.425 --> 01:05:24.678
<i>Yeah, the guy's
a psycho, but it's true.</i>

01:05:24.803 --> 01:05:26.388
<i>He's a mate also.
What can you do?</i>

01:05:26.471 --> 01:05:28.807
<i># And now we're living
in the sky #</i>

01:05:28.932 --> 01:05:31.935
<i># I'd never thought
I'd live so high #</i>

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:35.772
<i># Just like heaven

01:05:35.856 --> 01:05:38.442
<i># The lift is always
full of piss #</i>

01:05:38.525 --> 01:05:40.986
<i># The fifth-floor landing
smells of fish #</i>

01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:45.782
<i># Not just on Friday,
every single other day #</i>

01:05:45.866 --> 01:05:47.325
Hey.

01:05:47.409 --> 01:05:50.245
Pop into bookie's
and put a line on for us.

01:05:50.328 --> 01:05:52.330
Can you not go yourself?

01:05:52.664 --> 01:05:54.624
Well, seeing as how I'm
a fugitive from the law,

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:57.627
and I can't even walk
the fucking streets, you go.

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.088
Here.

01:06:01.339 --> 01:06:03.633
Doncaster.
4:40.

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:06.678
?5 you win.
Bad Boy.

01:06:15.228 --> 01:06:18.732
Buy some fucking beer.
I'm out.

01:06:24.654 --> 01:06:25.906
Come on, Bad Boy!

01:06:26.031 --> 01:06:27.532
Come on, son!
Come on, son!

01:06:27.657 --> 01:06:28.909
Come on!
Come on!

01:06:29.034 --> 01:06:37.667
Yeah!

01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:41.338
Bad Boy!

01:06:41.463 --> 01:06:43.673
<i>Came in at 16 to 1.</i>

01:06:43.757 --> 01:06:46.510
<i>And with the winnings,
we went out to celebrate.</i>

01:07:16.123 --> 01:07:18.792
<i>Diane was right.
The world is changing.</i>

01:07:18.917 --> 01:07:21.086
<i>Music is changing.
Drugs are changing.</i>

01:07:21.211 --> 01:07:23.130
<i>Even men and women
are changing.</i>

01:07:23.255 --> 01:07:24.673
<i>1, 000 years from now,</i>

01:07:24.756 --> 01:07:27.134
<i>there'll be no guys
and no girls, just wankers.</i>

01:07:27.259 --> 01:07:28.009
<i>Sounds great to me.</i>

01:07:33.557 --> 01:07:36.351
<i>It's just a pity
no one told Begbie.</i>

01:07:52.993 --> 01:07:55.454
Fuck!
Fuck!

01:07:55.579 --> 01:07:57.956
<i>You see, if you ask me,
we're heterosexual by default,</i>

01:07:58.081 --> 01:07:59.332
<i>not by decision.</i>

01:07:59.458 --> 01:08:02.085
<i>It's just a question
of who you fancy.</i>

01:08:02.169 --> 01:08:03.462
<i>It's all about aesthetics,</i>

01:08:03.587 --> 01:08:05.756
<i>and it's fuck-all to do
with morality.</i>

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:07.466
Fuck!

01:08:09.134 --> 01:08:11.428
<i>But you try telling
Begbie that.</i>

01:08:11.511 --> 01:08:13.972
Look, I'm not a fucking bufty.

01:08:14.097 --> 01:08:16.683
Let's face it.
It could have been wonderful.

01:08:20.103 --> 01:08:23.148
Fucking listen to me,
you piece of junkie shit.

01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:24.858
A joke's a fucking joke.

01:08:24.983 --> 01:08:28.111
You mention that again,
and I'll cut you up.

01:08:28.194 --> 01:08:30.404
You understand?

01:08:35.868 --> 01:08:36.953
<i>Since I last saw him,</i>

01:08:37.078 --> 01:08:40.122
<i>Sick Boy had reinvented himself
as a pimp and a pusher</i>

01:08:40.247 --> 01:08:42.751
<i>and was here, he said,
to mix business and pleasure,</i>

01:08:42.834 --> 01:08:46.129
<i>setting up "contacts,"
as he constantly informed me,</i>

01:08:46.212 --> 01:08:50.091
<i>for the great scag deal that
was going to make him rich.</i>

01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:57.640
Good chips.

01:08:58.517 --> 01:09:01.228
I can't believe you did that.

01:09:03.647 --> 01:09:05.816
I got a good price for it.

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:07.484
Rents, I need the money.

01:09:07.567 --> 01:09:10.153
It was my fucking telly!

01:09:10.278 --> 01:09:12.948
Well, if I'd known you were
going to get so humpty,

01:09:13.031 --> 01:09:15.117
I wouldn't have bothered.

01:09:17.536 --> 01:09:19.912
Fucking rented, anyway.

01:09:20.747 --> 01:09:22.624
You going to eat that?

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:30.173
Have you got a passport?

01:09:30.298 --> 01:09:31.841
Why?

01:09:31.925 --> 01:09:33.676
I met this bloke.

01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:35.845
Runs a hotel, a brothel.

01:09:35.929 --> 01:09:37.889
Loads of contacts.

01:09:38.014 --> 01:09:39.140
Does a nice sideline

01:09:39.224 --> 01:09:41.852
in punting British passports
to foreigners.

01:09:41.935 --> 01:09:43.687
Get you a good price.

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:46.732
And why would I want
to sell my passport?

01:09:50.861 --> 01:09:52.654
It was just an idea.

01:09:53.904 --> 01:09:55.907
<i>I had to get rid of them.</i>

01:09:56.032 --> 01:09:59.327
<i>Sick Boy didn't do his drug
deal, and he didn't get rich.</i>

01:09:59.411 --> 01:10:01.705
<i>Instead, he and Begbie
hung around my bed-sit</i>

01:10:01.788 --> 01:10:03.290
<i>looking for things to steal.</i>

01:10:03.415 --> 01:10:07.043
<i>I decided to put them in
the worst place in the world.</i>

01:10:10.505 --> 01:10:14.718
<i># Sandman goes, two in tow #</i>

01:10:14.801 --> 01:10:16.803
<i># Wet and dumb #</i>

01:10:21.516 --> 01:10:24.936
<i># Coming down again #</i>

01:10:33.612 --> 01:10:35.489
<i>They weren't paying
any rent,</i>

01:10:35.614 --> 01:10:38.241
<i>so when my boss
found two suckers who would,</i>

01:10:38.366 --> 01:10:41.328
<i>Sick Boy and Begbie were bound
to feel threatened.</i>

01:10:41.453 --> 01:10:44.998
Yep, lots of storage.
All mod cons.

01:10:45.123 --> 01:10:47.250
320 quid a week.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.504
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:10:50.629 --> 01:10:51.963
<i>And that was that.</i>

01:10:52.798 --> 01:10:55.467
<i>But by then we had another
reason to go back.</i>

01:10:55.592 --> 01:10:56.843
<i>Tommy.</i>

01:10:56.968 --> 01:10:58.970
Tommy knew he'd got
the virus, like,

01:10:59.096 --> 01:11:01.848
but he never knew
he'd gone full-blown.

01:11:01.973 --> 01:11:04.017
What was it,
pneumonia or cancer?

01:11:04.142 --> 01:11:06.603
No, toxoplasmosis.

01:11:06.728 --> 01:11:08.647
Sort of like a stroke.

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:10.232
How's that?

01:11:10.982 --> 01:11:13.568
He wanted to see Lizzy again.

01:11:14.152 --> 01:11:16.238
She wouldn't let him
near the house.

01:11:16.321 --> 01:11:19.950
So he bought her a present,
brought her this kitten.

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:21.993
I bet Lizzy told him
where to stick it.

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:25.122
Exactly. "I'm not wanting
that cat," she says.

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:26.540
Get the fuck, right.

01:11:26.665 --> 01:11:29.960
So there's Tommy stuck
with this kitten.

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:31.211
You can imagine what happened.

01:11:31.336 --> 01:11:33.797
To those of us
gathered here today,

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.093
Thomas McKenzie filled a number
of different roles in our lives.

01:11:38.176 --> 01:11:39.761
What?
- Thomas was a son.

01:11:39.845 --> 01:11:41.430
The thing was neglected.

01:11:41.513 --> 01:11:43.807
Pissing and shitting
all over the place.

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:44.975
Tommy's lying about,

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:48.478
fucked out of his eyeballs
on smack or downers.

01:11:48.603 --> 01:11:52.023
He never knew you could get
toxoplasmosis from cat shit.

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:56.903
A loving man with a great lust
for life.

01:11:57.738 --> 01:11:59.322
Neither did I.
What is it?

01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:01.616
Fucking horrible.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.577
It's like an abscess
in your brain.

01:12:03.702 --> 01:12:05.495
Fucking hell.

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:06.747
Then what happened?

01:12:06.872 --> 01:12:09.458
He starts getting
these headaches,

01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:12.794
so he just uses more smack,
you know, for the pain, like.

01:12:12.878 --> 01:12:14.963
And then he has a stroke.

01:12:15.046 --> 01:12:18.884
A fucking stroke.
Just like that.

01:12:19.009 --> 01:12:21.970
Gets home from the hospital
and dies three weeks later.

01:12:23.221 --> 01:12:24.556
He'd been dead for ages

01:12:24.681 --> 01:12:26.808
before the neighbors
complained about the smell

01:12:26.892 --> 01:12:29.811
and got the police
to break down the door.

01:12:29.895 --> 01:12:32.230
Tommy was lying facedown
in a pool of vomit.

01:12:32.355 --> 01:12:33.982
He has gone from us,

01:12:34.066 --> 01:12:37.486
but we have many things
to remember him by.

01:12:37.569 --> 01:12:38.570
The kitten was fine.

01:12:38.695 --> 01:12:41.907
Would you all please rise now
for the committal?

01:12:45.243 --> 01:12:50.332
<i># Did you think
I would leave you crying #</i>

01:12:50.415 --> 01:12:54.878
<i># When there's room
on my horse for two? #</i>

01:12:56.046 --> 01:13:00.675
<i># Climb up here, Tommy,
don't be dying #</i>

01:13:00.759 --> 01:13:05.180
<i># I can go just as fast
with two #</i>

01:13:05.263 --> 01:13:10.102
<i># When we grow up,
we'll both be soldiers #</i>

01:13:10.227 --> 01:13:14.940
<i># And our horses
will not be toys #</i>

01:13:15.065 --> 01:13:20.028
<i># And I wonder
if we'll remember #</i>

01:13:20.153 --> 01:13:24.658
<i># When we were
two little boys #</i>

01:13:27.452 --> 01:13:29.579
- Tommy.
- Tommy.

01:13:34.084 --> 01:13:36.044
Did you tell him yet?

01:13:37.087 --> 01:13:38.130
On you go.

01:13:38.255 --> 01:13:39.714
What?

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.466
There's this mate of Swanney's.

01:13:41.591 --> 01:13:43.301
You know the guy.
Mikey Forrester.

01:13:43.427 --> 01:13:44.636
Aye.

01:13:45.137 --> 01:13:50.475
Well, he's come into some gear.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.560
A lot of gear.

01:13:51.685 --> 01:13:53.145
How much gear?

01:13:54.938 --> 01:14:00.110
About two kilos, so he tells me.

01:14:00.193 --> 01:14:03.321
He got drunk in a pub down
by the docks last week,

01:14:03.447 --> 01:14:05.907
where he met
two Russian sailors.

01:14:06.032 --> 01:14:08.618
They're fucking carrying
this stuff for sale,

01:14:08.702 --> 01:14:10.120
there and then, like.

01:14:10.203 --> 01:14:13.623
So he wakes up the next morning,

01:14:13.707 --> 01:14:17.461
realizes what he's done,
gets very fucking nervous.

01:14:17.544 --> 01:14:19.129
He wants rid of this, right?

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:20.213
So?

01:14:20.338 --> 01:14:24.134
So he met me, and I offered
to take it off his hands

01:14:24.217 --> 01:14:26.887
at a very reasonable price,
with the intention

01:14:27.012 --> 01:14:29.556
of punting it on myself
to a guy I know in London.

01:14:29.681 --> 01:14:30.474
Ho ho-ho-ho!

01:14:30.557 --> 01:14:32.559
We've just come back
from Tommy's funeral,

01:14:32.684 --> 01:14:35.145
and you're talking
about a scag deal?

01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:38.148
Aye.

01:14:41.902 --> 01:14:43.737
What was your price?

01:14:43.862 --> 01:14:45.822
- Four grand.
- You haven't got four grand?

01:14:45.947 --> 01:14:47.574
We're?2,000 short.

01:14:47.699 --> 01:14:49.910
Well, that's tough.

01:14:50.035 --> 01:14:53.914
Look, every cunt knows you've
been saving up down in London.

01:14:54.039 --> 01:14:56.166
I'm sorry.
I do not have two grand.

01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:59.211
Aye, you fucking do.

01:15:00.712 --> 01:15:02.422
I've seen your bank statement.

01:15:02.547 --> 01:15:04.841
For fuck's sake.

01:15:04.925 --> 01:15:09.346
?2, 133.

01:15:09.429 --> 01:15:12.682
Two kilos.
What is that, 10 years?

01:15:12.808 --> 01:15:14.518
Mikey Forrester?
Russian sailors?

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:16.728
What the fuck
are you boys on, eh?

01:15:16.853 --> 01:15:18.522
Spud, you've already been
to jail.

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:21.108
What's the deal? You like it
so much you want to go back?

01:15:21.233 --> 01:15:23.610
I just want the money, Mark.

01:15:23.735 --> 01:15:25.612
If everybody keeps
their mouth shut,

01:15:25.737 --> 01:15:28.281
there'll be no cunt
going to jail.

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:34.538
<i>There were a lot
of possibilities running</i>

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:37.290
<i>through my mind about
what might happen in London.</i>

01:15:37.416 --> 01:15:40.627
<i>Things I didn't want to talk
to anyone about,</i>

01:15:40.752 --> 01:15:43.797
<i>ideas best kept to myself.</i>

01:15:43.922 --> 01:15:45.966
<i>No one told me
when we bought the scag,</i>

01:15:46.091 --> 01:15:48.844
<i>some lucky punter
would have to try it out.</i>

01:15:53.014 --> 01:15:54.641
<i>Begbie didn't trust Spud.</i>

01:15:54.766 --> 01:15:57.144
<i>Sick Boy was too careful
these days.</i>

01:15:57.269 --> 01:16:00.397
<i>So I rolled up my sleeve,
I spiked my vein,</i>

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:02.232
<i>and I did what had to be done.</i>

01:16:06.027 --> 01:16:07.904
It's good.

01:16:08.029 --> 01:16:11.116
Oh, it's really fucking good.

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:15.162
Mmm. Ohh.

01:16:15.287 --> 01:16:17.748
<i>Yeah, that hit was good.</i>

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:20.751
<i>I promised myself another one
before I got to London.</i>

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:24.254
<i>Just the one like.
For old time's sake.</i>

01:16:24.379 --> 01:16:27.090
<i>Just to piss Begbie off.</i>

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:28.925
<i>This was his nightmare.</i>

01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:31.762
<i>The dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams</i>

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:33.764
<i>being perpetrated with three
of the most useless</i>

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:37.434
<i>and unreliable fuck-ups
in town.</i>

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:39.102
<i>I knew what was going on
in his mind.</i>

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:41.730
<i>Any trouble in London, and
he would dump us immediately.</i>

01:16:41.813 --> 01:16:42.814
<i>One way or another.</i>

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:44.274
<i>He had to.</i>

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:46.610
<i>If he got caught
with a bagful of scag,</i>

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.236
<i>on top of
that armed-robbery shit,</i>

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.947
<i>he was going down for 15 to 20.</i>

01:16:51.323 --> 01:16:53.200
<i>Begbie was hard,
but not so hard</i>

01:16:53.325 --> 01:16:56.286
<i>that he didn't shite it
off 20 years in Sultan.</i>

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:06.129
<i>This was to be my final hit.</i>

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:08.090
<i>But let's be clear about this.</i>

01:17:08.173 --> 01:17:11.259
<i>There's final hits
and final hits.</i>

01:17:11.343 --> 01:17:13.345
<i>What kind was this to be?</i>

01:17:18.392 --> 01:17:20.185
Did you bring the cards?

01:17:20.477 --> 01:17:21.812
- What?
- The cards.

01:17:21.895 --> 01:17:24.481
The last thing I told you
was to mind the cards.

01:17:24.564 --> 01:17:26.691
Well, I've not brought them.

01:17:28.693 --> 01:17:31.029
Fucking boring after a while
without the cards.

01:17:31.154 --> 01:17:33.281
I'm sorry.

01:17:33.365 --> 01:17:35.575
- Bit fucking late.
- Why didn't you bring them?

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:39.413
'Cause I fucking told you
to bring them, you doss cunt!

01:17:40.205 --> 01:17:41.415
Christ.

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:30.422
These are your friends, right?

01:18:30.547 --> 01:18:33.592
These are the guys
I told you about.

01:18:33.717 --> 01:18:36.094
- Well, is he here?
- Yeah, he's here.

01:18:36.219 --> 01:18:38.096
You didn't get followed,
did you?

01:18:38.221 --> 01:18:40.265
We didn't get followed.

01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:41.725
Okay.

01:18:58.784 --> 01:18:59.951
All right.

01:19:00.077 --> 01:19:01.244
Aye.

01:19:03.914 --> 01:19:06.458
<i>Straightaway he clocked us
for what we were.</i>

01:19:06.583 --> 01:19:09.544
<i>Small-time wasters
with an accidental big deal.</i>

01:19:20.514 --> 01:19:22.224
Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:20:15.569 --> 01:20:20.198
So how much would you like
for this?

01:20:22.701 --> 01:20:24.286
?20,000.

01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:29.082
Well, I don't think it's worth
much more than? 15,000.

01:20:29.207 --> 01:20:31.001
<i>This was a real drag to him.</i>

01:20:31.084 --> 01:20:33.003
<i>He didn't need to negotiate.</i>

01:20:33.086 --> 01:20:35.338
<i>What the fuck were we going
to do if he didn't buy it?</i>

01:20:35.422 --> 01:20:38.091
<i>Sell it on the streets?
Fuck that!</i>

01:20:38.216 --> 01:20:40.010
Well,? 19,000.

01:20:40.093 --> 01:20:42.888
I'm terribly sorry.
I can't go to? 19,000.

01:20:45.557 --> 01:20:47.893
Well, fucking? 16,000, then.

01:20:49.936 --> 01:20:50.854
Okay.

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:53.565
Well, fucking? 16,000
it is, then.

01:20:57.944 --> 01:21:01.239
These, gentlemen,
are?2,000 bundles.

01:21:01.364 --> 01:21:04.117
Here's two.

01:21:04.242 --> 01:21:05.952
That's four.

01:21:06.078 --> 01:21:08.455
<i>We settled on?16, 000.</i>

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:12.334
<i>He had more in the suitcase,
but it was better than nothing.</i>

01:21:19.424 --> 01:21:21.968
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

01:21:22.094 --> 01:21:24.679
I'd like to say it's been
a pleasure haggling with you.

01:21:24.763 --> 01:21:27.015
Fucking brand-new,
by the way.

01:21:29.476 --> 01:21:30.435
Okay.

01:21:32.938 --> 01:21:34.981
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:21:35.107 --> 01:21:36.483
Fucking...

01:21:37.401 --> 01:21:40.153
<i>And just for a moment,
it felt really great.</i>

01:21:40.278 --> 01:21:42.155
<i>Like we were in it together,
like friends.</i>

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.740
<i>Like it meant something.</i>

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:46.326
<i>A moment like that
can touch you deep inside.</i>

01:21:46.451 --> 01:21:47.932
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like?16, 000.</i>

01:21:47.967 --> 01:21:49.413
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like?16, 000.</i>

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:52.666
So what about you, Spud, any
investments on the horizon?

01:21:52.791 --> 01:21:55.001
Gonna buy yourself
a wee island in the sun?

01:21:55.127 --> 01:21:56.128
For four fucking grand?

01:21:56.253 --> 01:22:00.298
One palm tree, a couple
of rocks, and a sewage outflow.

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:03.510
I don't know, man.

01:22:03.635 --> 01:22:06.096
I'm gonna get something
for my ma.

01:22:06.179 --> 01:22:10.392
Get some good speed, no bicarb.

01:22:10.475 --> 01:22:12.519
And get a girl, take her out,
treat her right.

01:22:12.644 --> 01:22:13.603
Shag her senseless.

01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:15.772
No, man!
True love.

01:22:15.897 --> 01:22:17.274
True love.

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:18.775
Hey, but I could handle

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.778
some hot sex
with a Jewish Princess.

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.947
- You daft cunt!
- Or a Catholic!

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:25.031
If you're gonna waste it
on a bird,

01:22:25.157 --> 01:22:27.617
you may as well fucking
leave all of it to me.

01:22:27.743 --> 01:22:29.119
Now get the drinks.

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:32.372
- I got the last one.
- It's your round, Franco.

01:22:33.915 --> 01:22:35.876
Okay.
Same again?

01:22:36.001 --> 01:22:38.420
Right.
I'm off for a pish.

01:22:38.503 --> 01:22:41.089
See when I get back
the money's still here, okay?

01:22:41.173 --> 01:22:43.008
The moment your back's turned,
we're out the door.

01:22:43.133 --> 01:22:44.718
I'll be right fucking after you.

01:22:44.843 --> 01:22:47.471
You'll never catch us,
you flabby bastard.

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:49.848
By the way,
see when I get back.

01:22:49.973 --> 01:22:52.476
Be halfway down the street
with the money.

01:22:52.601 --> 01:22:53.977
Fucking kill you.

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:56.313
I thought you might, Franco.

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:57.939
I thought you might.

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:04.654
Are you game for it?

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:06.281
What?

01:23:07.991 --> 01:23:09.451
Well?

01:23:10.535 --> 01:23:12.120
Are you serious?

01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:21.129
Don't know.

01:23:21.213 --> 01:23:22.714
What do you think?

01:23:24.049 --> 01:23:25.217
Still here, I see.

01:23:25.342 --> 01:23:27.719
Oh, well, we wouldn't
run out on a mate, eh?

01:23:27.844 --> 01:23:30.180
Why not?
I know I would.

01:23:31.056 --> 01:23:32.724
Where's Franco?

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:37.813
For fuck's sake!

01:23:37.896 --> 01:23:39.106
Sorry, mate.

01:23:39.231 --> 01:23:42.526
You ruined my fucking suit,
you fucking idiot.

01:23:42.609 --> 01:23:44.069
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

01:23:44.194 --> 01:23:46.238
Sorry's not gonna
dry me off, you cunt.

01:23:46.363 --> 01:23:49.324
Cool down, Franco.
The man says he's sorry.

01:23:49.408 --> 01:23:52.661
Not sorry enough
for being a fat cunt.

01:23:52.744 --> 01:23:54.871
If you can't hold a pint,
you shouldn't be in the pub.

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:55.997
Fuck off.

01:24:00.419 --> 01:24:02.129
Aah.

01:24:02.254 --> 01:24:04.631
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, no!

01:24:11.972 --> 01:24:14.015
Come on, Franco, move away.
Aah!

01:24:14.141 --> 01:24:16.518
Aah!
Fuck's sake!

01:24:16.601 --> 01:24:19.104
Oh, fucking nice one, Franco!

01:24:19.229 --> 01:24:20.897
- Shut it!
- You cut me, man!

01:24:20.981 --> 01:24:23.066
You were in my fucking way.

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:24.484
Help!

01:24:25.652 --> 01:24:26.987
Oh, no.

01:24:27.112 --> 01:24:30.323
Anybody else want to get
in my fucking way?

01:24:30.449 --> 01:24:31.658
You?

01:24:34.077 --> 01:24:35.203
You?

01:24:40.167 --> 01:24:45.589
Hey, Rent Boy, you bring me down
a fucking smoke.

01:24:45.672 --> 01:24:48.633
- I think we'd better go, Franco!
- Go to the hospital!

01:24:48.759 --> 01:24:52.512
You're not going to any fucking
hospital, and you're staying.

01:24:55.515 --> 01:24:58.643
You bring me down
a fucking cigarette.

01:25:04.441 --> 01:25:06.026
And the bag.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.227
<i># Drive boy, dog boy,
dirty, numb, angel boy #</i>

01:26:22.352 --> 01:26:25.689
<i># In-the-doorway boy,
she was a lipstick boy #</i>

01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:29.109
<i># She was a beautiful boy,
and tears, boy #</i>

01:26:29.234 --> 01:26:31.695
<i># And all in
your inner space, boy #</i>

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:35.115
<i># You had hand, girl's boy,
and steel, boy #</i>

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.075
<i># You had chemicals, boy #</i>

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.661
<i># I've grown so close
to you, boy #</i>

01:26:39.745 --> 01:26:41.538
<i># And you just groan, boy #</i>

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:43.874
<i># She said,
"Come over, come over" #</i>

01:26:43.999 --> 01:26:46.585
<i># She smiled at you #</i>

I ripped them off.</i>

<i>if he'd only thought
of it first.</i>

01:28:58.508 --> 01:29:01.303

I felt sorry for Spud.</i>

01:29:01.386 --> 01:29:03.221
<i>He never hurt anybody.</i>
