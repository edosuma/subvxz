WEBVTT

00:23.923 --> 00:25.559
Anderson's
coming out fast and furious.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.061
And he's just
Reiss Gibbons.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.863
That cut
looks deep,..

00:30.964 --> 00:32.333
It sure does, Jimmy.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.235
Will the Cinderella story
of Reiss Gibbons continue?

00:34.335 --> 00:36.604
Can he defend his Legends
Light Heavyweight title

00:36.704 --> 00:37.971
for a fifth straight time?

00:38.071 --> 00:40.139
Or will Anderson dash his hopes?

00:47.548 --> 00:50.217
Reiss pushes Anderson
to the center of the cage.

00:50.317 --> 00:53.454
Anderson is so quick and
so smooth with his kicks.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.021
Come on, Reiss.

00:55.121 --> 00:57.757
These two men are
putting on one hell of a fight.

00:57.857 --> 01:00.960
This has been one of the
most exciting title fights

01:01.060 --> 01:04.163
in Legends history.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.700
Max Black has to be pleased
with the way her champion is

01:06.799 --> 01:07.934
performing tonight.

01:08.034 --> 01:09.503
Everybody is on hand
to see this fight.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.771
It's always an event
when he steps into the cage.

01:11.871 --> 01:12.673
Come on!

01:12.772 --> 01:14.007
Finish him!

01:14.107 --> 01:15.542
Anderson is
so quick to firing up

01:15.643 --> 01:16.876
those kicks, Bobby.

01:16.976 --> 01:17.977
Yeah, they're
really starting to open

01:18.077 --> 01:19.280
up the cut above Reiss's eye.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.281
He's knocked him down!

01:20.381 --> 01:22.650
Anderson's
right back up.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.617
Reiss is relentless.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.985
He stalks Anderson.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.987
He's raining down elbows.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.556
He's got him up
against the cage.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.527
Wait a minute.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.229
Showtime Kick!

01:35.329 --> 01:37.298
Reiss counters
with a right hand!

01:37.398 --> 01:38.164
What a fight!

01:38.265 --> 01:39.667
Reiss
knocked him out!

01:39.767 --> 01:41.067
He knocked him out!

01:41.167 --> 01:42.636
Beautiful right hand.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.438
Incredible!

01:44.538 --> 01:47.408
Ladies and gentlemen, you
are looking at the number

01:47.508 --> 01:49.376
one fighter on the planet...

01:49.476 --> 01:50.977
the five-time Legends
Light Heavyweight

01:51.077 --> 01:52.546
Champion of the World.

02:03.357 --> 02:06.527
Reiss, that's five
title defenses in a row now.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.428
How are you feeling?

02:07.528 --> 02:08.462
I feel amazing, lad.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.663
Unstoppable.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.698
Anderson
opened up that cut

02:10.798 --> 02:11.732
in the beginning of the round.

02:11.831 --> 02:12.999
How bad did he hurt you?

02:13.099 --> 02:14.468
You know, he
definitely left his mark.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.236
Thank you, Stephanie.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.339
What's next
for the five-time champ?

02:18.439 --> 02:20.808
Uh, I'm gonna be a dad.

02:20.907 --> 02:21.941
Have you got any tips?

02:25.312 --> 02:28.515
We want to stay in the
Reiss Gibbons business.

02:28.615 --> 02:33.387
Five-time champ has a
real nice ring to it.

02:33.487 --> 02:38.359
OK, it's "Alien" meets "Prison
Break" set in a space jail.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.460
Who would I be playing?

02:39.560 --> 02:41.160
The most dangerous
cop on earth wrongly

02:41.261 --> 02:43.797
accused and sent to space jail.

02:43.896 --> 02:44.997
It's a bit cliche, isn't it?

02:47.601 --> 02:50.036
We want to continue protecting
those pearly whites of yours.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.439
That's molded perfectly
to your mouth.

02:52.539 --> 02:53.841
How's that feel?

02:54.775 --> 02:55.776
What'd he say?

02:55.875 --> 02:57.211
It feels great.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.480
Check this out.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.013
Your own shoe.

03:01.114 --> 03:06.420
There aren't very many athletes
with their very own shoe.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.721
"Baby Swap."

03:07.821 --> 03:11.258
You're a dangerous cop who
swaps bodies with an infant.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.793
"Hard and Wet."

03:12.892 --> 03:15.396
It's "Fast and Furious"
on a cruise ship.

03:15.496 --> 03:19.366
The speed is low, but the
stakes are crazy high.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.401
You into this?

03:20.501 --> 03:21.435
Try the gun.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.969
When you step out
onto the red carpet,

03:23.069 --> 03:24.638
you're going to have the
best smile in show biz.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.880
Hey, babe.

04:06.979 --> 04:08.348
She's done it again.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.350
I told you, you've got to
put the nappy on straight.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.421
She's got a tiny bladder, baby.

04:14.521 --> 04:15.789
I think she's
doing it on purpose.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.524
Of course she's not.

04:17.624 --> 04:18.859
Are you?

04:18.958 --> 04:21.395
Every time I pick her
up, she pisses on me.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.997
I thought footwork
was your thing, big guy.

04:25.097 --> 04:26.733
Well, I'm not quick
enough for this one.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.635
Silly lump.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.838
That's Marcus.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.739
Where's Daddy going?

04:32.840 --> 04:34.475
Is Daddy going to go to work?

04:34.575 --> 04:35.375
Love you.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.678
Bye.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.679
Say bye to Daddy.

04:38.779 --> 04:39.379
Bye.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.247
Bye.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.248
Bye.

04:41.348 --> 04:42.616
Hm?

04:52.992 --> 04:53.627
Nice one.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.049
All right.

05:17.149 --> 05:18.986
Line up, everyone.

05:19.085 --> 05:22.121
Come on, line up.

05:22.222 --> 05:25.792
All right, before everyone
goes home, Reiss, come up here.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.436
Been together a long time.

05:36.537 --> 05:40.741
You drive me crazy, but
I'm very proud of you.

05:40.841 --> 05:41.642
Love you, man.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.977
I love you too, Marcus.

05:44.076 --> 05:45.412
All right.

05:45.512 --> 05:50.049
Let's welcome back the
five-time Light Heavyweight

05:50.149 --> 05:52.786
World Champion, Reiss Gibbons.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.537
at 10:00 AM
with Stevenson's manager.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.772
Yep.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.006
I need to make him understand
why has

06:13.105 --> 06:14.741
to be his first title defense.

06:14.841 --> 06:15.909
He's really stubborn, Max.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.312
Oh, man, he doesn't
know stubborn.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.047
At 12:00 you need
to be in Birmingham

06:20.146 --> 06:21.848
to meet with Anderson
to renew his contract.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.050
Good, good.

06:23.149 --> 06:24.651
Then you fly
straight out to Vegas

06:24.751 --> 06:26.653
to sit down with The Nightmare
who's just become a free agent.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.288
He hasn't become a
free agent,..

06:28.388 --> 06:29.923
He's become the free agent.

06:30.023 --> 06:30.991
The guy's a monster.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.960
I gotta sign him.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.661
Oh, boy.

06:34.761 --> 06:35.762
So how we looking here?

06:35.862 --> 06:39.633
20,000 capacity.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.968
Yeah?

06:41.068 --> 06:44.404
You think we could fill it?

06:44.504 --> 06:46.239
With a solid
headliner, we can.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.912
Speaking of which.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.313
Give me a second.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.948
Yep.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.617
There he is!

06:56.717 --> 06:57.985
How you doing, man?
- I'm good, Max.

06:58.085 --> 06:58.819
How you doing?

06:58.919 --> 06:59.653
Nice to see you.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.220
Good to see you.

07:00.320 --> 07:00.954
Looking good.

07:01.054 --> 07:01.588
Thank you.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.222
You too.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.056
How Reiss doing?

07:03.155 --> 07:04.091
Yeah, he's great.

07:04.190 --> 07:04.791
In phenomenal shape as always.

07:04.891 --> 07:05.993
Of course.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.062
So I got a proposition
for you boys.

07:09.161 --> 07:09.930
Go on.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.231
All right.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.633
So now you defended
the title five times.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.202
Now, Reiss has basically
cleaned out the division.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.237
I think the fans
deserve something

07:17.337 --> 07:20.841
really special for the
sixth title defense.

07:20.941 --> 07:21.942
Well, what have
you got in mind?

07:22.042 --> 07:22.976
What are you thinking?

07:23.076 --> 07:25.112
Randy Stone.

07:25.212 --> 07:25.946
Who?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.114
Randy Stone, man.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.281
Oh, come on.

07:28.382 --> 07:30.217
He's the current
pro wrestling champ.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.752
Max, isn't it?

07:31.852 --> 07:35.889
It's an opportunity for us
to tap in to their audience.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.025
So Reiss can do what, jump
off tables and smash people

07:38.125 --> 07:39.292
over the head with chairs?

07:39.393 --> 07:40.827
No, so he can fight
in the Legends cage.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.897
Max, look, Reiss went through
a murderer's row to become

07:43.997 --> 07:44.831
champ, and you know that.

07:44.931 --> 07:46.099
Yeah.

07:46.198 --> 07:47.701
And now you want
to offer a title shot

07:47.801 --> 07:49.436
to this random wrestler who's
never even set foot in a cage

07:49.536 --> 07:50.103
before.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.071
How does that work?

07:51.170 --> 07:52.773
What's Reiss got to lose?

07:52.873 --> 07:56.309
His dignity, his pride,
his self-respect, his fan.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.712
I mean, this guy, what, does
he wear tights for a living?

07:58.812 --> 07:59.479
Come on.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.715
Reggie, think about this.

08:01.815 --> 08:07.521
We do this fight, all of Randy
Stone's fans tune into it.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.390
Reiss beats the fucking
shit out of him,

08:10.490 --> 08:16.697
and whammo, all of a sudden
Stone's fans are Reiss's fans.

08:16.797 --> 08:17.431
Ta-da!

08:17.531 --> 08:18.365
Come on.

08:18.465 --> 08:19.499
Think about Conor
McGregor, right?

08:19.599 --> 08:20.734
When he fought
Mayweather, do you

08:20.834 --> 08:22.969
know how much money
that guy is making

08:23.070 --> 08:23.937
in endorsements,?

08:24.037 --> 08:25.405
Oh, yeah.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.940
They are... millions are
coming out of that guy's ass,

08:27.040 --> 08:28.642
and he didn't even win.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.976
Huh?

08:30.077 --> 08:30.777
I mean, come on.

08:30.877 --> 08:31.978
Look at that.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.947
Reiss, Reiss, Reiss...
he would freak

08:34.047 --> 08:35.982
out all these people, right?

08:36.083 --> 08:37.117
He would love it.

08:37.217 --> 08:37.884
I'll see.
I'll let you know, Max.

08:37.984 --> 08:38.618
Yeah?

08:38.719 --> 08:39.186
All right.

08:39.986 --> 08:40.754
Be smart.

08:40.854 --> 08:41.588
Take it easy, Max.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.689
All right, I'll give you a call.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.991
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.326
Fucking managers.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.127
How'd that go?

08:47.227 --> 08:48.161
Yeah, great.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.797
Let's go.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.800
Nobody in this sport seems
to have any guts anymore.

08:53.900 --> 08:57.404
Nobody in this organization
seems to have any guts anymore.

08:57.504 --> 08:58.206
I love this guy.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.139
He's funny, man.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.407
Want a drink?

09:00.507 --> 09:02.375
Yeah, I need one
after seeing this shit.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.544
You haven't seen danger yet.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.280
They want to call me dangerous,
you haven't seen nothing yet.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.282
They want to call me violent...

09:09.382 --> 09:11.585
You're trying...
you're trying to tell

09:11.685 --> 09:12.753
me I have to fight this guy?

09:12.853 --> 09:13.854
Yeah.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.890
Buffalo Bad Boy, trust
me when I tell you...

09:16.990 --> 09:19.092
This guy is amazing.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.228
What? how is he amazing?

09:20.327 --> 09:21.328
He's amazing.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.496
He's amazing.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.730
He'll make you
look great as well.

09:23.830 --> 09:24.664
Look.

09:24.765 --> 09:25.999
He's bare chested,
he's committed.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.236
This is going
to be a hard pass.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.569
I'm not fighting him.

09:29.669 --> 09:30.837
Well, I'll have to hard
sell it to you, then.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.240
Are you scared oh his pecs?

09:32.339 --> 09:33.406
- Definitely?
- Is that what this is?

09:33.507 --> 09:34.374
Because he's topless?
- Petrified.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.175
You can be topless, too.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.476
I've seen it.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.145
Look at it as more of
an exhibition match.

09:38.246 --> 09:39.312
His fans are gonna tune in.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.847
He's got these
crazy wrestling fans

09:40.947 --> 09:41.948
who love watching him get hit
over the head with a steel

09:42.048 --> 09:43.183
chair.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.751
He's not going to
have a steel chair.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.419
He's gonna have no weapons.
He's gonna have to fight you.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.921
And these so-called tough
guys are going get knocked

09:48.021 --> 09:49.322
out easily, emphatic fashion.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.423
I want a highlight
reel knockout.

09:50.524 --> 09:51.558
Can you give me that?

09:51.658 --> 09:53.293
I want someone
like..

09:53.393 --> 09:54.228
Three-fight win streak.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.095
Yeah, look...

09:55.195 --> 09:56.264
That's.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.165
Look how entertaining
this guy is.

09:58.266 --> 09:58.899
Right?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.033
Bare chest?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.301
He's entertaining
as a comedian.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.335
Looks like he just
stepped out of some

10:02.435 --> 10:03.237
sort of an '80s tribute band.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.805
Look.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.374
...when I get that son of a
bitch inside a steel cage and I

10:07.474 --> 10:10.211
get my fingernails
underneath his eyelids

10:10.310 --> 10:11.511
and I pull on its flesh...

10:11.611 --> 10:13.880
Come on, you gotta
give this guy a shot.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.382
Give this guy a shot.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.017
He should be a comedian.
I'm not going to lie.

10:17.117 --> 10:17.851
He is making me laugh.

10:17.951 --> 10:18.718
He is a comedian.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.288
Look, he's got a
massive fan base

10:20.387 --> 10:21.321
in the rest of the world, yeah?

10:21.421 --> 10:22.856
They're going to come over.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.724
They're going to give us those
pay-per-view numbers, man.

10:24.825 --> 10:25.592
OK?

10:25.692 --> 10:27.093
Boss lady asked for this, yeah?

10:27.194 --> 10:28.328
It's what Max wants.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.729
Yeah, so when you
knock him out, like

10:29.830 --> 10:31.565
I said, in devastating
fashion, you can have you

10:31.665 --> 10:32.732
whatever you want after that.

10:38.239 --> 10:40.140
You deserve this.

10:40.241 --> 10:41.209
Ooh!

10:41.309 --> 10:43.009
You deserve it.

10:43.109 --> 10:43.910
All right.

10:44.010 --> 10:44.644
Think about it, yeah?

10:44.744 --> 10:45.213
Easy money?

10:45.313 --> 10:46.479
Easy money.

10:46.580 --> 10:47.681
Easy money, man.
Easy money.

10:47.781 --> 10:48.381
All right.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.516
Can we toast to this?

10:49.616 --> 10:50.951
- We can toast to this.
- To you.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.152
To knocking out.
- Give me the contract.

10:52.253 --> 10:53.221
I'll give you the contract.

10:53.321 --> 10:54.054
And let's clean
out this clown.

10:54.154 --> 10:54.821
Easy money.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.424
This episode
of "The MMA Show"

10:57.524 --> 10:59.025
is brought to you by Lex.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.995
Lex, providing capital
to fuel growth in energy,

11:02.095 --> 11:04.298
tech, and real estate.

11:04.397 --> 11:08.034
And right now we're joined in
studio by none other than Max

11:08.134 --> 11:10.537
Black, promoter of Legends.

11:10.637 --> 11:14.674
And apparently you have
a pretty big announcement

11:14.774 --> 11:16.277
for our listeners today, huh?

11:16.376 --> 11:17.544
That's right, Stephen.

11:17.644 --> 11:21.215
We are putting together
the biggest fight

11:21.315 --> 11:23.049
in the history of Legends.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.851
All right, you ready for this?

11:24.951 --> 11:25.418
Mm-hmm.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.086
You sure?

11:26.186 --> 11:26.987
Yeah.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.421
All right, here we go.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.260
Reiss Gibbons, five-time
light heavyweight champion,

11:32.360 --> 11:34.461
will be fighting Randy Stone.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.835
From pro wrestling?

11:41.935 --> 11:43.937
That's right.

11:44.037 --> 11:44.938
Max, come on.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.673
I mean, no offense
to pro wrestling,

11:46.773 --> 11:48.608
but you're not talking about
a real fight here, are you?

11:48.708 --> 11:51.444
I mean, you're talking MMA
you're talking pro wrestling...

11:51.544 --> 11:52.346
apples, oranges.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.114
Stephen, come on, man.

11:54.215 --> 11:55.316
Use your imagination.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.717
You put four-ounce
gloves on anyone,

11:57.817 --> 12:00.587
and in MMA, anything
could happen.

12:00.687 --> 12:01.755
That's why people love it.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.056
That's what's so
beautiful about it.

12:03.156 --> 12:07.627
You can't possibly look
me in the eyes right now

12:07.727 --> 12:10.664
and tell me that you
believe that Randy

12:10.764 --> 12:13.733
Stone has any chance,
has a chance in hell,

12:13.833 --> 12:15.902
of beating Reiss Gibbons.

12:16.002 --> 12:16.870
He's got a shot.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.406
How is it that
this guy just walks

12:18.505 --> 12:22.909
in from pro wrestling
into MMA and off the bat

12:23.009 --> 12:23.944
he gets a title shot?

12:24.044 --> 12:24.511
It's unheard of.

12:24.611 --> 12:25.779
It's absurd.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.315
The purists are going
to go crazy here.

12:27.415 --> 12:29.616
Honestly, I saw
this guy train.

12:29.716 --> 12:32.320
I mean, he's knocking
out his sparring partners

12:32.420 --> 12:33.853
left and right.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.390
And did I mention, Danny Thicket
is training him right now.

12:36.489 --> 12:37.358
He's a legend, of course.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.692
Legendary trainer.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.627
And he wouldn't be
wasting his time on anyone

12:40.727 --> 12:42.062
unless he believed in him.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.496
Randy Stone is also huge.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.531
Big guy.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.099
The guy is as strong as an ox.

12:46.199 --> 12:49.102
Max, Max, are you just trying
to take a turd here, polish

12:49.203 --> 12:50.304
it up, and call it a diamond?

12:50.404 --> 12:51.571
Or... come on.

12:51.671 --> 12:52.772
I'm telling you, I
think this is going

12:52.872 --> 12:54.507
to be a really exciting fight.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.642
There you have it.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.944
So one month from today.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.045
Yep.

12:59.145 --> 12:59.779
Reiss Gibbons.

12:59.879 --> 13:00.513
Yep.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.781
- Randy Stone.
- Yep.

13:01.881 --> 13:02.450
For the Light
Heavyweight Championship.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.384
Uh-huh.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.517
And that's me.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.518
It's going to
be a fight you're

13:05.618 --> 13:06.920
never going to forget about.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.422
I know, but you see
what I'm doing right now?

13:08.521 --> 13:09.256
- You're tapping out.
- You're tapping out.

13:09.357 --> 13:10.557
I'm tapping out.

13:10.657 --> 13:11.392
I'm tapping out on "The
MMA Show" for today.

13:11.491 --> 13:11.825
That's all I got.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.230
I can't believe it, man.

13:16.330 --> 13:18.131
Believe it.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.000
Oh.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.701
Man.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.238
Beautiful thing, man.

13:24.338 --> 13:24.904
You did it.

13:28.108 --> 13:32.213
That's you up there, your
face, for everyone to see.

13:32.313 --> 13:32.979
Everyone?

13:33.747 --> 13:35.216
Kids will see that.

13:35.316 --> 13:37.218
They look up to you anyway
because you're tall.

13:37.318 --> 13:37.984
Most people anyway.

13:38.084 --> 13:38.952
Most people.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.820
But now they
really see it, man.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.356
Walking past this, remember?

13:42.456 --> 13:43.757
I remember, man.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.825
As a kid I broke down billboard.

13:45.925 --> 13:46.826
With the paper hanging up?

13:46.926 --> 13:49.463
With the paper hanging up.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.031
Now look at us, man.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.565
Yeah, man.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.101
It's beautiful.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.069
Yeah, man.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.875
Man, are you crying?

14:01.975 --> 14:02.809
Huh?

14:02.909 --> 14:05.078
There might be a
slight tear, bro.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.946
It might be.

14:07.047 --> 14:07.747
Oh, come here.

14:09.517 --> 14:10.617
It's OK, it's OK.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.152
See,.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.131
The Legends cage
is reserved for the very

14:25.232 --> 14:27.634
best fighters on the planet.

14:27.734 --> 14:31.604
And Reiss Gibbons is
the best of the best.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.941
The five-time champion
has faced all challenges

14:35.041 --> 14:36.843
and cleared out his division.

14:36.943 --> 14:39.879
Now, with all his endorsement
deals and new movie deals,

14:39.979 --> 14:42.649
Reiss Gibbons is on
top of the world.

14:46.520 --> 14:49.956
But it wasn't always
like this for Reiss.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.526
Reiss comes from
humble beginnings.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.694
He is the oldest
of three children,

14:54.794 --> 14:56.996
and his parents,
Amanda and Dante,

14:57.097 --> 15:01.034
passed away when he
was just 15 years old.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.969
Reiss was left to
fend for himself.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.705
When my parents passed
away, it was really tough.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.741
I felt lost, and...

15:08.842 --> 15:10.710
you know, until I met Marcus.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.946
He kind of took
me under his wing.

15:13.046 --> 15:17.951
And, you know, he showed me
how to throw my first punch.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.386
I didn't know how
to express myself,

15:19.487 --> 15:22.922
and he showed me how to
put that and turn it around

15:23.022 --> 15:24.157
and make it positive, you know.

15:24.258 --> 15:24.724
That's all right.

15:24.824 --> 15:25.593
Let him work.

15:25.692 --> 15:26.360
Let him work there.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.496
Let him work.

15:28.596 --> 15:29.363
Nice.

15:29.463 --> 15:30.797
Nice.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.066
Yeah, Marcus has taught
me, as a man and a fighter,

15:33.166 --> 15:38.037
to be humble in victory or
defeat, to look after your own.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.773
And that's exactly why my
family is so important.

15:40.874 --> 15:42.610
That's exactly why
is so important to me,

15:42.709 --> 15:45.246
because I gotta look
after my people, you know.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.782
Do you know, people
recognizing you on the street,

15:49.883 --> 15:51.751
it's a bit weird at the start.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.052
But you kind of get used to it.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.688
And again, I don't
want to turn them down.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.525
I want to show them
that I do care.

15:57.625 --> 16:00.227
If they want a picture, it
takes two seconds out of my day.

16:00.327 --> 16:03.230
Who am I to say no to that?

16:03.330 --> 16:06.166
I love coming back
and coming to the gyms

16:06.267 --> 16:09.570
and seeing their little
faces beam when I walk in.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.272
Yeah, I do think I can
inspire them, for sure.

16:11.372 --> 16:14.774
You know, seeing someone from
their own area coming up,

16:14.874 --> 16:17.944
having a rough childhood,
losing people that they love,

16:18.044 --> 16:20.648
you know, and I still
am on the right track.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.016
I would love to
inspire all of them.

16:23.116 --> 16:26.487
If I didn't have fighting
to fall back on, who knows?

16:26.587 --> 16:32.259
I would have been either in
a cell or in a box, six foot

16:32.359 --> 16:33.594
deep.

16:33.693 --> 16:37.130
That's how most people
I know have ended up.

16:37.231 --> 16:38.765
So it's not no joke.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.235
It's serious.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.002
But his
sixth title defense

16:43.102 --> 16:45.071
presents a new challenge...

16:45.171 --> 16:47.308
wrestling champion Randy Stone.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.612
Randy is one of
the best wrestlers

16:51.711 --> 16:53.112
the world has ever seen.

16:53.214 --> 16:57.083
And he's gonna shake up the
world of Mixed Martial Arts.

16:57.183 --> 17:01.821
I am on a pilgrimage to
scorch the earth of AEW one

17:01.921 --> 17:06.960
broken leg at a time, until
I am the last man standing.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.563
Well, hands down, Randy Stone
is the most powerful fighter

17:09.663 --> 17:11.064
that I've ever worked with.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.600
He's one of the strongest
human beings I've ever seen.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.001
For a world champion,
I don't think he's

17:15.101 --> 17:16.303
ever been hit by a guy like me.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.439
It's going to be like
getting hit by a truck.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.507
He thinks that's
some kind of joke.

17:20.608 --> 17:21.841
It ain't going to be funny.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.743
Well, he knocks out all
his training partners.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.312
So I've been having
a hard time keeping

17:25.412 --> 17:26.647
people in the ring with him.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.616
He's so intense and he's
so powerful that he's

17:28.716 --> 17:29.949
been knocking them out clean.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.051
It's actually getting to
be a bit of a problem.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.654
Randy's the
most divisive figure

17:33.786 --> 17:35.589
to ever step foot
in the Legends cage,

17:35.689 --> 17:38.858
splitting the world of MMA and
professional wrestling right

17:38.958 --> 17:41.228
down the middle.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.796
I've been in the
ring with Randy Stone.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.798
And I know this
is the MMA world.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.368
And I am sure
Gibbons thinks he's

17:47.468 --> 17:49.703
going to have a night
off because wrestling

17:49.802 --> 17:51.137
is fake, right?

17:51.238 --> 17:52.972
But you can't fake toughness.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.742
And you can't fake strength.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.010
And Randy Stone
has both of those.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.647
I think both Gibbons
and the MMA world

17:59.747 --> 18:01.282
are going to be in for a shock.

18:01.382 --> 18:02.383
He truly is hardcore.

18:02.483 --> 18:03.651
He is extreme.

18:03.751 --> 18:05.252
And everyone's talking
about this match.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.854
When Reiss hits Randy Stone and
he realizes he can't hurt Randy

18:07.954 --> 18:11.258
Stone, the life and soul
will get totally sucked

18:11.358 --> 18:12.760
out of Reiss Gibbons.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.961
I'm picking Randy all the way.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.797
Randy, as an
opponent, he's a clown.

18:17.897 --> 18:18.798
It's a joke.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.367
That's why I keep laughing.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.135
How can I keep a straight face
when we talk about this guy?

18:22.236 --> 18:23.537
I feel like I'm
going to walk through

18:23.637 --> 18:26.473
him like I walk through
my Sunday dinners at home.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.509
I want to stick a fork
in him because he's done.

18:28.609 --> 18:30.143
We've seen this all before.

18:30.244 --> 18:31.177
He's funny.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.746
People want to come
over ,

18:32.845 --> 18:34.113
especially from
more an acting sort

18:34.214 --> 18:36.317
of background, fake wrestling.

18:36.417 --> 18:37.518
This is real life.

18:37.618 --> 18:38.818
This is real sport.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.387
And I think you have
more chance of seeing

18:40.487 --> 18:43.757
Elvis Presley crash a UFO on
top of the Loch Ness Monster

18:43.856 --> 18:45.091
than him winning.

18:45.191 --> 18:47.461
Randy Stone coming in
to fight Reiss Gibbons.

18:47.561 --> 18:48.629
What do I think?

18:48.729 --> 18:50.029
Not much.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.365
I don't think it's going
to have anything to offer.

18:51.465 --> 18:53.400
I think Reiss puts him
away in the first round.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.868
I find it incredibly
disrespectful when

18:55.968 --> 18:58.938
so-called experts
talk about how pro

18:59.038 --> 19:01.408
wrestlers aren't real athletes.

19:01.508 --> 19:05.479
I'm telling you, Randy Stone is
going to this guy up.

19:05.579 --> 19:10.049
Randy Stone is not
going to be Reiss Gibbons.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.786
Reiss Gibbons is going to
beat him the first round

19:12.885 --> 19:15.154
by knockout or submission.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.691
I know Randy Stone
quite well, actually.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.959
And he wouldn't be
doing anything that he

19:20.059 --> 19:21.928
doesn't think he can win.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.831
And I know the performance
side is one thing,

19:23.930 --> 19:26.233
but there's a lot of
overlap in the training.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.435
And I think people are
going to be surprised.

19:28.535 --> 19:33.374
And watching Randy train, he's
got some heavy hands, man.

19:33.474 --> 19:35.509
He's got some real
pop in those hands.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.977
I think he's going to
surprise a lot of critics.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.613
He's going to shut
a lot of mouths,

19:39.713 --> 19:43.250
people that doubt professional
wrestlers in MMA fights.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.419
All eyes
will be on this fight.

19:45.519 --> 19:46.754
And one thing is for sure.

19:46.854 --> 19:49.889
The world of professional
wrestling and the world of MMA

19:49.989 --> 19:50.557
will collide.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.665
And we're joined
by Randy Stone.

19:58.766 --> 20:02.068
Randy, thanks for taking the
time to talk with us today.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.504
Oh, you're welcome.

20:03.604 --> 20:06.273
Now, many pro wrestlers
have attempted to cross over

20:06.373 --> 20:08.575
into MMA and do what you're
about to do right now

20:08.675 --> 20:10.377
and haven't quite found the...

20:10.477 --> 20:13.881
to put it politely, the
success they were hoping for.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.114
What makes you any different?

20:15.215 --> 20:16.517
I don't think about it.

20:16.617 --> 20:18.485
I didn't come here to talk
about some other losers.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.587
I didn't come here to talk
about somebody else's failures.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.390
I didn't come here to
talk about the past.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.991
I came here to talk
about the future,

20:25.091 --> 20:27.628
and the future is, I'm
gonna knock Reiss Gibbons'

20:27.728 --> 20:29.061
head off of his shoulders.

20:29.162 --> 20:30.664
These are bricks.

20:30.764 --> 20:32.666
These are Mack trucks.

20:32.766 --> 20:34.902
I'm gonna knock him out.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.169
I've been telling
everybody for weeks.

20:36.270 --> 20:37.103
I'm telling the whole world.

20:37.204 --> 20:38.137
I'm gonna knock him out.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.907
And you all think it's a joke.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.174
You're talking to me...

20:41.275 --> 20:42.709
I'm here on this bush
league level show.

20:42.810 --> 20:44.378
Randy, we can appreciate
that you have your game face on

20:44.478 --> 20:47.514
and you're in the zone,
but we're the biggest

20:47.614 --> 20:48.882
MMA show in the world, so...

20:48.981 --> 20:51.318
Everybody thinks this is going
to be some big embarrassment.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.287
Everybody thinks I'm going to
go out there and get my pants

20:53.387 --> 20:55.522
pulled down and show the crack
of my ass in front of the whole

20:55.622 --> 20:56.790
world, like I'm gonna...

20:56.890 --> 20:59.192
I'm gonna be the one
that's embarrassed.

20:59.293 --> 21:01.027
There's a lot of gum chewing
going on there as well.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.529
You know, people do that
when they're nervous.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.498
There's a reason I'm the
biggest superstar in the world.

21:04.598 --> 21:07.668
There's a reason he needs
me to sell a pay-per-view.

21:07.768 --> 21:08.902
That's the irony.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.404
Well, you're not
lacking confidence.

21:10.504 --> 21:13.574
But let me ask you, this is
your first pro MMA fight,

21:13.674 --> 21:16.343
your first training camp.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.811
And how's that going for you?

21:17.911 --> 21:19.011
It's going, dude.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.547
I'm in the best
shape of my life.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.014
I'm stronger than him.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.817
I'm bigger than him.

21:23.917 --> 21:25.084
I'm faster than him.

21:25.184 --> 21:25.985
I'm tougher than him.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.287
I'm smarter than him.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.555
I'm better looking than him.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.224
- I
- have no respect for him.

21:30.324 --> 21:31.959
But you have to realize
that the pundits, the experts,

21:32.058 --> 21:34.661
have Reiss as a 10-to-1
favorite to retain

21:34.761 --> 21:35.829
his title against you.

21:35.929 --> 21:38.332
And if you're
keeping score, those

21:38.432 --> 21:41.000
are the worst odds for
any challenger competing

21:41.100 --> 21:42.870
inside of a Legends cage.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.304
How are you feeling?

21:44.404 --> 21:48.140
Odds makers, betting
lines, people playing games.

21:48.242 --> 21:51.912
No, this ain't... this
ain't a game, dude.

21:52.011 --> 21:52.746
This is absurd.

21:52.846 --> 21:54.481
Where's he going?

21:54.581 --> 21:56.917
This isn't scripted like the
other place you came from.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.184
Come on.

21:58.285 --> 21:59.319
I don't know what he
was expecting here.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.354
I mean, we ask the
tough questions

22:00.454 --> 22:01.488
on "The Stephen Drake Show."

22:01.588 --> 22:02.723
We're going to take
a little break.

22:02.823 --> 22:03.891
We're going to pay the bills.

22:03.991 --> 22:05.492
We're going to come
back, and we're

22:05.592 --> 22:07.126
going to talk to the Nightmare,
the hottest free agent in MMA.

22:19.273 --> 22:21.642
He should be here
in a minute anyway.

22:21.742 --> 22:23.844
Oh, there he is.

22:23.944 --> 22:26.078
Look, he brought
his cheerleaders.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.681
He's a lot bigger in person.

22:27.781 --> 22:28.715
He ain't that big.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.049
Should we go say hello?

22:30.149 --> 22:31.083
Sure, come on.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.789
Yo, Randy, I thought
I'd introduce myself.

22:35.889 --> 22:37.056
I'm Reiss.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.759
I'm not going to
shake your fucking hand.

22:38.859 --> 22:39.826
What?

22:39.927 --> 22:41.093
After all that
shit you talked?

22:41.193 --> 22:42.529
Man, that's just promotion.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.598
I thought you of all people
would understand that.

22:44.698 --> 22:45.832
Yeah.

22:45.933 --> 22:48.167
You don't know shit
about promotion.

22:48.268 --> 22:50.671
You don't think I belong
in a cage with you?

22:50.771 --> 22:51.705
I don't.

22:51.805 --> 22:52.940
But let's keep it professional.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.474
I'm going to make
you a lot of money.

22:54.575 --> 22:55.809
Oh, no, no, no.

22:55.909 --> 22:56.944
Let's get this straight.

22:57.044 --> 22:58.045
I don't need you.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.279
You need me.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.248
I'm going to make
you a lot of money.

23:01.348 --> 23:03.082
You should show some respect.

23:07.421 --> 23:09.723
Save it for the fight.

23:14.061 --> 23:14.795
All right.

23:14.895 --> 23:15.963
Welcome, everyone.

23:16.063 --> 23:18.498
Welcome to "Legends:
Worlds Collide."

23:18.599 --> 23:22.302
Man, we are so excited
about this fight.

23:22.402 --> 23:25.272
When my father died and I
took over Legends, many of you

23:25.372 --> 23:26.873
people in this very room...

23:26.974 --> 23:29.175
I know who you are,
I don't forget...

23:29.276 --> 23:31.478
thought I was going to run
Legends into the ground.

23:31.578 --> 23:37.684
And now here we are, on the
cusp of the biggest fight

23:37.784 --> 23:39.052
in our history.

23:39.151 --> 23:42.356
And we are trending
at this moment,

23:42.456 --> 23:45.459
looking around, over 2
million buys on pay-per-view.

23:45.559 --> 23:48.595
So definitely at
the right place.

23:48.695 --> 23:49.997
All right.

23:50.097 --> 23:52.699
So why don't we open it up to
questions, let these guys talk.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.703
Randy, what's your
mental state right now?

23:56.803 --> 23:57.671
Are you excited?

23:57.771 --> 23:58.672
Are you feeling confident?

23:58.772 --> 24:00.741
Brother, there
ain't a word for what

24:00.841 --> 24:02.376
my mental state is right now.

24:02.476 --> 24:04.678
Confidence is not the word.

24:04.778 --> 24:07.381
Complete self-assurance.

24:07.481 --> 24:10.450
Like I know the sun's going
to come up tomorrow morning,

24:10.550 --> 24:13.086
I know I'm going to take
this man's head off.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.488
I'm feeling homicidal.

24:14.588 --> 24:16.155
Reiss is feeling suicidal.

24:16.256 --> 24:17.424
I'm going to kill this man.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.959
Man, you've got to
stop acting, Randy.

24:19.059 --> 24:19.826
You know that, right?

24:19.926 --> 24:21.160
This is real.

24:21.261 --> 24:22.462
When we step in there...
when we step in there,

24:22.562 --> 24:24.163
I ain't gonna throw
you through no table,

24:24.264 --> 24:25.197
jump off a turnbuckle, huh?

24:25.298 --> 24:26.266
Yeah, it's gonna be real.

24:26.366 --> 24:27.567
This is real.
Yeah, it's real.

24:27.668 --> 24:28.568
- It's going to be real.
- It's real.

24:28.669 --> 24:29.336
You laugh.

24:29.436 --> 24:30.237
You think it's a joke.

24:30.337 --> 24:31.738
You're all laughing.

24:31.838 --> 24:34.007
You and your stupid little
blog, you think I'm a joke.

24:34.107 --> 24:36.977
Nobody listens to your stupid
fucking podcast, by the way.

24:37.077 --> 24:38.445
Everybody thinks
this is some kind

24:38.545 --> 24:42.282
of Max Black big
publicity stunt, put Randy

24:42.382 --> 24:44.117
Stone in a cage, real big joke.

24:44.217 --> 24:46.053
It's not going to be
funny when they're pulling

24:46.153 --> 24:48.021
Reiss's teeth out of
the back of his ass

24:48.121 --> 24:49.690
when I knock his head off.

24:49.790 --> 24:50.691
All right, all right.

24:50.791 --> 24:52.592
How about we have
another question?

24:52.693 --> 24:53.827
Reiss, Reiss!

24:55.128 --> 24:56.630
Hey, Reiss...
have you looked

24:56.730 --> 24:59.166
at any of the wrestling greats
for, you know, a new gimmick?

24:59.266 --> 25:02.402
Someone like Roddy Piper
or Macho Man Randy Savage.

25:02.502 --> 25:03.970
Hey, fuck you over
there, all right?

25:04.071 --> 25:05.872
This isn't a joke.

25:05.972 --> 25:08.375
I'm going to beat this man
within an inch of his life.

25:08.475 --> 25:11.244
I'm going to walk away with
that championship belt.

25:11.344 --> 25:12.579
I'm the toughest
man in the world.

25:12.679 --> 25:15.048
I'm the biggest name
in combat sports.

25:15.148 --> 25:16.049
I'm going to prove that.

25:16.149 --> 25:17.484
Let's see.

25:17.584 --> 25:18.819
Let's see when you're
standing in front of 20,000

25:18.919 --> 25:20.253
strong Londoners, yeah?

25:20.353 --> 25:21.888
Let's see.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.290
You're going to be quaking in
your little leather boots, man.

25:23.390 --> 25:24.624
You're going to
get lobotomized.

25:24.725 --> 25:26.259
You're not going to be
able to form sentences

25:26.359 --> 25:27.394
after I knock you out.

25:27.494 --> 25:28.428
I just hope you'll
be able to get

25:28.528 --> 25:29.563
your dick hard after the fight.

25:29.663 --> 25:31.431
All right, all
right, guys, hey?

25:31.531 --> 25:33.433
If not, honey, you
know where to find me.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.203
I'll be in the biggest
suite in London.

25:35.302 --> 25:37.938
I won't even make you
sleep on the couch.

25:42.943 --> 25:45.213
OK, OK, OK, OK.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.850
And here we
are at last, the fight

25:49.950 --> 25:51.651
the world has been waiting for.

25:51.752 --> 25:55.055
Reiss Gibbons versus Randy
Stone, Worlds Collide.

25:55.155 --> 25:56.456
These
guys have been trash

25:56.556 --> 25:58.825
talking each other for weeks.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.795
That's real bad blood
between these two fighters.

26:01.895 --> 26:05.065
The live gig
sold out within an hour.

26:05.165 --> 26:06.500
If we look at the
tale of the tape,

26:06.600 --> 26:09.002
the big thing that jumps
out are their records.

26:09.102 --> 26:12.906
Reiss Gibbons, undefeated with
a perfect record of 19 and 0,

26:13.006 --> 26:15.842
versus Randy Stone's 0 and 0.

26:15.942 --> 26:19.045
This is Randy Stone's
first ever professional fight.

26:19.146 --> 26:22.115
This has gotten big fight
bill written all over it.

26:22.216 --> 26:25.118
You are
absolutely right, Jimmy.

26:31.491 --> 26:32.626
Look right here.

26:32.726 --> 26:34.161
Look right here.

26:34.262 --> 26:35.229
Me.

26:35.328 --> 26:36.096
Come on.

26:36.196 --> 26:38.331
Me.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.933
Yeah, looking good, huh?

26:40.033 --> 26:40.934
How are you?
How's it going?

26:41.034 --> 26:41.835
Good, good, good.

26:41.935 --> 26:43.069
Yeah, you feel good?

26:43.170 --> 26:45.206
I feel good I'm gonna
whoop this clown's ass, man.

26:45.305 --> 26:46.106
Yeah?

26:46.207 --> 26:46.907
You ready to kill him?

26:47.974 --> 26:49.075
Just do me a favor.

26:49.176 --> 26:50.177
Try not to make it
too quick so I can

26:50.278 --> 26:51.378
squeeze in a couple of spots.

26:51.478 --> 26:52.546
I'll try, I'll try.

26:52.646 --> 26:53.914
But I know, easy
money for me, right?

26:54.014 --> 26:54.748
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:54.848 --> 26:55.382
Just take it easy.

26:55.482 --> 26:56.217
Have a good time.

26:56.316 --> 26:57.350
You need anything?

26:57.450 --> 26:58.219
Bottle of
champagne for my win.

26:58.318 --> 26:59.352
All right.

26:59.452 --> 27:00.187
Afterward it'll be
waiting for you.

27:00.288 --> 27:00.954
Dom Perignon, yeah?

27:01.054 --> 27:01.988
All right.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.089
You got it, man.
- All right.

27:03.190 --> 27:03.723
All right.
Have a good time.

27:03.824 --> 27:05.226
2, 3.

27:05.325 --> 27:05.926
2, 3.

27:08.662 --> 27:10.363
The internet has
literally been exploding

27:10.463 --> 27:11.798
in the build-up to this fight.

27:11.898 --> 27:14.334
I don't think I've ever seen
this level of hostility.

27:14.434 --> 27:15.802
Absolutely, Bobby.

27:15.902 --> 27:18.538
And there are so many question
marks surrounding Stone.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.407
While Randy is
known as a wrestler,

27:20.507 --> 27:22.243
a little known
fact is he actually

27:22.342 --> 27:24.511
started out boxing
as a teenager when he

27:24.611 --> 27:26.079
was growing up in Cincinnati.

27:26.179 --> 27:28.682
He has described those years
as some of the most rewarding,

27:28.782 --> 27:31.451
and that is the itch that
got him into the cage.

27:35.155 --> 27:37.057
You got this.

28:09.089 --> 28:10.390
OK, gentlemen.

28:10.490 --> 28:12.792
We already went over the
rules in the locker room.

28:12.893 --> 28:14.995
Any questions from
the challenger?

28:15.095 --> 28:16.429
Any questions from the champion?

28:16.529 --> 28:18.832
OK, you can touch
gloves if you want.

28:18.932 --> 28:21.668
And there's the
theatrics from pro wrestling.

28:21.768 --> 28:24.471
I guess Randy
Stone doesn't touch hands.

28:29.377 --> 28:30.710
Fight.

28:30.810 --> 28:33.247
Randy Stone comes
out with a flying knee.

28:33.347 --> 28:34.814
He's not wasting
any time in there.

28:34.915 --> 28:36.650
Randy's throwing
hooks with bad intentions,

28:36.750 --> 28:39.653
but he's lacking a lot of
finesse in his technique.

28:39.753 --> 28:40.921
He's really sloppy in there.

28:41.021 --> 28:42.489
He's just
hurling his punches.

28:42.589 --> 28:43.690
I would
like to see Reiss

28:43.790 --> 28:45.158
keep his hands up, though.

28:45.259 --> 28:46.459
Get in there, Randy.

28:46.559 --> 28:47.594
Take this serious.
Come on.

28:47.694 --> 28:48.428
Keep your hands up.

28:48.528 --> 28:49.230
Quit showboating.

28:49.330 --> 28:50.730
Let's go.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.969
He really does
look like an amateur in there

28:56.069 --> 28:56.970
with a professional.

28:57.070 --> 28:59.039
Reiss is so smooth
with his striking,

28:59.139 --> 29:02.709
so technical, whereas Randy
telegraphs his punches.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.911
This looks like
it's going to get ugly real

29:05.011 --> 29:06.446
quick for Randy Stone.

29:06.546 --> 29:08.349
At least he's starting
to do some real damage

29:08.448 --> 29:09.283
against the cage.

29:09.383 --> 29:11.551
He's turning it up.

29:11.651 --> 29:12.786
Yes, he is, Bobby.

29:12.886 --> 29:14.521
Randy is picking him
apart, and he's just

29:14.621 --> 29:18.024
landed a spinning back kick.

29:18.124 --> 29:21.528
Reiss tosses Randy Stone to
the ground like a rag doll.

29:21.628 --> 29:23.730
Well, Randy
rushes in like a bull.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.632
He presses Reiss up
against the cage.

29:25.732 --> 29:29.536
Reiss is just so
hard to take down, though.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.940
Randy's
grabbing the fence.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.710
There's no five second
rule like in pro wrestling.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.014
Off the cage.

29:41.114 --> 29:41.881
Circle out.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.119
Randy's
doing a really

29:46.220 --> 29:47.821
good job of applying pressure.

29:47.921 --> 29:52.926
I'm surprised Reiss hasn't
managed to escape by now.

29:53.026 --> 29:54.661
And Randy Stone
has landed a takedown.

29:54.761 --> 29:57.365
That is only the second
time in Reiss's career

29:57.465 --> 29:58.565
he has been taken down.

29:58.665 --> 29:59.899
I'm stunned, Bobby.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.669
Taking down Reiss
Gibbons is no small feat.

30:02.769 --> 30:04.070
This is
signature Danny Thicket,

30:04.170 --> 30:06.506
working up against the
cage, dirty boxing,

30:06.606 --> 30:07.941
making it a dogfight.

30:08.041 --> 30:10.877
And Randy's landed
a second takedown.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.280
I'm really surprised
at how much Reiss is struggling

30:13.381 --> 30:14.315
with Randy's size and power.

30:14.415 --> 30:14.981
Back it.

30:15.081 --> 30:15.682
Back up.

30:21.422 --> 30:22.689
Well,
this is what Danny

30:22.789 --> 30:24.190
Thicket has been talking about.

30:24.291 --> 30:26.960
There's one thing you can't
fake, and that's strength.

30:27.060 --> 30:29.195
And Randy's just hit
a slight judo throw.

30:30.130 --> 30:31.499
Work your way up.

30:31.598 --> 30:33.033
Get out of there.

30:33.133 --> 30:34.801
Reiss is
back up, and he's just

30:34.901 --> 30:37.837
landed a nice elbow, opening
up a cut in Randy Stone's head.

30:41.141 --> 30:42.909
Randy has
another takedown.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.677
That's the fourth of this fight.

30:44.778 --> 30:46.380
I can't believe it.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.282
And now he's Reiss.

30:48.382 --> 30:50.583
Reiss is launching haymakers.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.552
Randy is
clearly demonstrating

30:52.652 --> 30:54.154
his strength advantage.

30:54.255 --> 30:57.123
Reiss is really struggling.

30:57.224 --> 30:58.024
Nice.

30:58.124 --> 30:58.558
Nice work.

30:58.658 --> 30:59.427
Go to work.

30:59.527 --> 31:00.093
Let's work.

31:04.564 --> 31:05.832
Reiss is on
shaky legs out there.

31:05.932 --> 31:07.901
He really looks
unsure of himself.

31:08.001 --> 31:08.568
Come on, Reiss.

31:08.668 --> 31:11.372
Keep your hands up.

31:11.472 --> 31:12.639
Reiss
lands a nice jab.

31:12.739 --> 31:15.742
Combinations, just
like we practiced.

31:15.842 --> 31:17.211
Another.

31:17.311 --> 31:19.679
Reiss looks like he's
getting back into his groove.

31:19.779 --> 31:22.048
He's creating some distance.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.218
He's got to keep Stone
away from him, though.

31:24.318 --> 31:25.785
He needs to keep those hands up.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.091
Randy lands a hook.

31:31.191 --> 31:34.060
Finish him.

31:36.263 --> 31:37.063
Reiss is out!

31:37.163 --> 31:37.730
Oh, my god.

31:37.831 --> 31:38.631
I can't believe it.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.100
Reiss is knocked out.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.835
He is out.

31:55.715 --> 31:57.884
That's one of the
most dynamic punches

31:57.984 --> 31:59.553
I've ever seen in this cage.

31:59.652 --> 32:00.854
Oh, my god.

32:00.954 --> 32:02.722
He's wrestling down
the referee right now.

32:02.822 --> 32:05.024
Reiss doesn't even
know where he is.

32:05.125 --> 32:09.296
TJ Steele is talking to Reiss,
and Reiss is still coming to.

32:09.396 --> 32:10.297
It's over.

32:10.397 --> 32:11.898
You're knocked out.

32:17.137 --> 32:20.407
What started out as a
joke has turned into a travesty

32:20.508 --> 32:22.775
for Reiss Gibbons and his team.

32:22.876 --> 32:24.378
This is the
most shocking night

32:24.478 --> 32:27.248
in the history of Legends,
perhaps in the history

32:27.348 --> 32:28.848
of Mixed Martial Arts.

32:28.948 --> 32:31.318
I don't think a single person
in this arena saw this coming.

32:35.788 --> 32:37.291
I told you all!

32:50.670 --> 32:52.172
And look at him...

32:52.273 --> 32:52.939
shouting to the crowd.

32:53.039 --> 32:55.543
The antics... he's loving it.

32:55.643 --> 32:59.879
Randy Stone is loving it.

32:59.979 --> 33:01.415
Welcome to the Randy Stone era.

33:01.515 --> 33:02.081
Wow!

33:06.953 --> 33:11.124
Ladies and gentlemen, winning
the fight in the first round

33:11.225 --> 33:16.530
by knockout, and new Light
Heavyweight Legends Champion

33:16.630 --> 33:22.101
of the World, Randy Stone!

33:34.481 --> 33:36.383
I told you!

33:36.483 --> 33:37.351
I told all you.

33:37.451 --> 33:39.353
You thought I was a joke.

33:39.453 --> 33:40.787
Who's the joke now?

33:40.887 --> 33:43.490
Reiss Gibbons is a joke.

33:43.591 --> 33:45.725
I'm the champion
of the world now.

33:45.825 --> 33:47.428
Who's laughing now?

33:47.528 --> 33:49.396
Laugh it up!

33:53.032 --> 33:54.401
We're gonna party in London
tonight, you motherfuckers.

34:54.762 --> 34:55.862
It's 3:00 in the morning.

35:02.068 --> 35:03.203
I've been turned into a meme.

35:10.009 --> 35:14.481
"When your mom says quit
crying before she gives

35:14.581 --> 35:16.250
you something to cry about."

35:20.387 --> 35:23.990
"When you lose your mom
in the grocery store."

35:36.969 --> 35:37.837
People suck.

35:43.076 --> 35:44.211
Come back to bed.

35:47.414 --> 35:48.081
I'm good, baby.

36:23.684 --> 36:26.953
Reiss, thanks for coming
on the show tonight.

36:27.053 --> 36:29.155
How are you feeling?

36:29.256 --> 36:30.724
Well, losing is no fun.

36:30.824 --> 36:32.259
Yeah, I can imagine.

36:32.359 --> 36:33.794
The doctors, what do they say?

36:33.893 --> 36:35.027
What kind of time frame
are you looking at here?

36:35.128 --> 36:36.230
When are you getting
back in the cage?

36:36.330 --> 36:39.700
Well, I wasn't
knocked out, so anytime.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.001
You... you kind of were, Reiss.

36:42.101 --> 36:43.303
I took no damage.

36:43.404 --> 36:45.773
I can get back in there
as soon as possible.

36:45.873 --> 36:47.073
Look, I respect you.

36:47.173 --> 36:48.675
The whole MMA
community respects you.

36:48.776 --> 36:51.412
But there were some questions
about your cage etiquette.

36:51.512 --> 36:53.213
They're saying you didn't
take this fight seriously,

36:53.313 --> 36:54.981
and you didn't take
Randy Stone seriously.

36:55.081 --> 36:56.115
And you paid for it.

36:56.216 --> 36:57.518
Take it easy,
Steve, all right?

36:57.618 --> 37:02.955
Look, if I was showboating
and I got the knockout,

37:03.055 --> 37:05.626
no one would be talking, right?

37:05.726 --> 37:10.531
But I was having fun in there,
I got clipped, that's that.

37:10.631 --> 37:12.366
Lucky shot.

37:12.466 --> 37:15.001
Is this the biggest upset
in the history of MMA?

37:15.101 --> 37:18.070
Well, that's for you to
decide, Steve, all right?

37:18.171 --> 37:19.640
Well, do you get
the immediate rematch?

37:19.740 --> 37:21.241
Do you want the
immediate rematch?

37:21.341 --> 37:22.609
Well, yeah.

37:22.709 --> 37:25.279
You know, I've held the belt
longer than anyone, you know.

37:25.379 --> 37:31.452
But... that's
after this tiny little movie

37:31.552 --> 37:33.085
from Jake Thorn.

37:33.186 --> 37:34.655
Reiss, are you...

37:34.755 --> 37:36.457
are you not on social media?

37:36.557 --> 37:38.659
Yeah, I just
turned my phone off.

37:38.759 --> 37:40.227
I'm not trying
to pile on here.

37:40.327 --> 37:43.530
One of your castmates tweeted
out about a half hour ago...

37:43.630 --> 37:45.432
and I don't mean to be the
bearer of bad news here,

37:45.532 --> 37:48.569
but apparently
you've been replaced.

37:48.669 --> 37:50.370
They recast the role.

37:50.471 --> 37:52.071
What?

37:52.171 --> 37:53.674
It's on Twitter.

37:53.774 --> 37:55.041
You should turn your phone on.

37:57.344 --> 37:59.780
Prostitutes we
can pay off, yeah?

37:59.880 --> 38:01.080
Women claiming that
you've got kids

38:01.180 --> 38:02.616
through them that
you're not paying for,

38:02.716 --> 38:03.884
we can pay them off, too.

38:03.983 --> 38:06.152
But you get busted for
steroids, injecting

38:06.253 --> 38:08.755
needles into your left
butt cheek five times...

38:08.856 --> 38:09.890
and you tell me
it's an accident.

38:09.989 --> 38:11.425
Is it an accident?

38:11.525 --> 38:12.559
What was you doing?

38:12.659 --> 38:13.660
Was you in Vegas again
with the snow bunnies?

38:13.760 --> 38:14.828
Yeah?

38:14.928 --> 38:16.128
Sniffing cocaine
off their fake tits

38:16.230 --> 38:17.163
and playing darts with
them, and the darts

38:17.264 --> 38:18.765
happened to contain steroids?

38:18.866 --> 38:20.099
And then you happened to land
on them accidentally five times?

38:20.199 --> 38:20.868
You're right.

38:20.968 --> 38:21.702
Picograms, man.

38:21.802 --> 38:22.836
It's a real thing.

38:22.936 --> 38:24.204
It's a real thing,
and it happens.

38:24.304 --> 38:25.305
Yeah?

38:25.405 --> 38:26.340
Now, what you're going
to do, you're going

38:26.440 --> 38:27.508
to go home and see your family.

38:27.608 --> 38:28.742
By the way, your
wife's been calling

38:28.842 --> 38:29.710
me every single morning, yeah?

38:29.810 --> 38:30.878
Why doesn't she call you?

38:30.978 --> 38:31.912
Do you know why
she can't call you?

38:32.011 --> 38:32.813
Cause your phone's always off.

38:32.913 --> 38:34.080
Why is it always off?

38:34.180 --> 38:35.549
You got a 10-bedroom
mansion back there.

38:35.649 --> 38:36.683
You can afford a charger.

38:36.783 --> 38:38.285
So what you're gonna do,
you're gonna go home,

38:38.385 --> 38:39.353
and you're gonna get a
phone call from me, yeah?

38:39.453 --> 38:40.888
And when you get
that phone call,

38:40.988 --> 38:42.054
it's going to be me talking
about the press conference.

38:42.154 --> 38:43.055
Yeah?
Stephen Drake.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.190
He's going to get the exclusive.

38:44.291 --> 38:45.526
You're gonna talk
about your life.

38:45.626 --> 38:47.126
You're gonna talk about
the fact that fighting

38:47.227 --> 38:48.262
is the only thing that's
kept you sane, all right?

38:48.362 --> 38:49.763
And that's going
to secure things.

38:49.863 --> 38:51.565
You're gonna have to deal
with a two-year suspension.

38:51.665 --> 38:52.599
When you come back, you're gonna
come back stronger than ever.

38:52.699 --> 38:53.467
Yeah, look at me...

38:53.567 --> 38:54.301
stronger than ever.

38:54.401 --> 38:55.569
You're going to be the champion.

38:55.669 --> 38:56.937
Have another kid in
the meantime, yeah?

38:57.036 --> 38:57.638
And don't drive
home yourself, yeah?

38:57.738 --> 38:59.239
Get a cab.

38:59.339 --> 39:00.774
We don't need you running over
any pregnant women again, yeah?

39:00.874 --> 39:02.009
That was a difficult situation
to solve, wasn't it, yeah?

39:02.108 --> 39:02.709
All right.
Wicked.

39:02.809 --> 39:03.577
Could on.

39:03.677 --> 39:04.545
You got this, yeah?

39:04.645 --> 39:05.579
Stay out of trouble
till then, yeah?

39:05.679 --> 39:06.813
Thank you, Carlos.

39:06.914 --> 39:11.150
And Carlos, please don't
end up in Dubai again, yeah?

39:14.621 --> 39:16.757
All right.

39:16.857 --> 39:17.424
Magic man.

39:21.228 --> 39:22.529
I deserve this.

39:30.437 --> 39:32.104
Yo, I'm cut from
Jake Thorn's movie.

39:32.205 --> 39:33.607
I just found out.

39:33.707 --> 39:36.577
How does Stephen fucking
Drake find out before I do?

39:36.677 --> 39:38.177
And you're supposed to
be the first to know.

39:38.278 --> 39:39.746
Reiss, I was going
to call you as soon as.

39:39.846 --> 39:41.982
So what happened?

39:42.081 --> 39:43.383
That role was about
you being the strongest

39:43.483 --> 39:45.184
soldier in the whole world.

39:45.285 --> 39:48.422
It just doesn't work if
you're not the champ.

39:48.522 --> 39:49.890
That was only my first loss.

39:49.990 --> 39:51.024
I know.

39:51.123 --> 39:51.725
I know, Reiss.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.830
It's not the fact that you lost.

39:56.930 --> 39:58.865
It's the way you lost.

39:58.966 --> 40:02.235
The crying thing, the wrestling
the ref to the canvas.

40:02.336 --> 40:03.437
The media just got hold of it.

40:03.537 --> 40:04.705
And you know better than anyone.

40:04.805 --> 40:06.573
You're only as good
as your last fight.

40:06.673 --> 40:08.775
People have got a real
short-term memory these days.

40:08.875 --> 40:10.444
Then get me the rematch.

40:10.544 --> 40:11.143
It's too soon.

40:11.244 --> 40:12.144
We need to run it back.

40:12.245 --> 40:13.947
Get me the rematch, Reggie.

40:14.047 --> 40:14.848
Are you sure?

40:14.948 --> 40:17.417
Get me the rematch now.

40:17.517 --> 40:19.052
Laila Ali has a plus one.

40:19.151 --> 40:20.020
Yeah, definitely.

40:20.119 --> 40:20.721
Front row.

40:20.821 --> 40:22.656
Great.

40:22.756 --> 40:24.992
Idris Alba wants 10.

40:25.092 --> 40:25.692
10?

40:25.792 --> 40:26.893
10 comps?

40:26.994 --> 40:28.160
Guy's lucky he's so hot.

40:28.261 --> 40:29.062
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

40:29.161 --> 40:29.830
Front row?

40:29.930 --> 40:30.697
That's great.

40:30.797 --> 40:32.499
Peter Andre?

40:32.599 --> 40:33.033
No.

40:33.132 --> 40:33.900
No, no, no.

40:34.001 --> 40:34.801
Hard no.

40:34.901 --> 40:35.669
Hey, Max.

40:35.769 --> 40:36.670
Reggie!

40:36.770 --> 40:37.169
You got a minute?

40:37.270 --> 40:38.305
Of course.

40:38.405 --> 40:39.339
For you, I got a
minute and a half.

40:39.439 --> 40:39.806
Lovely.

40:39.906 --> 40:40.674
Yeah.

40:40.774 --> 40:41.475
You look great, too.

40:41.575 --> 40:42.042
Look at you.

40:42.141 --> 40:42.943
Hi, Fred.

40:43.043 --> 40:43.644
What's poppin', Reg?

40:43.744 --> 40:44.077
Not bad.

40:44.176 --> 40:44.778
Not bad.

40:44.878 --> 40:45.412
All good.

40:45.512 --> 40:46.113
Right.

40:46.213 --> 40:47.080
You're in a good mood.

40:47.179 --> 40:48.582
Yeah, are you kidding me?

40:48.682 --> 40:50.617
I got sponsors coming out
of my ears, my eyes, my ass.

40:50.717 --> 40:52.953
It's great.

40:53.053 --> 40:53.687
Congratulations.

40:53.787 --> 40:54.388
Thank you.

40:54.488 --> 40:57.758
Hey, team effort, man.

40:57.858 --> 40:58.992
So we getting that rematch?

40:59.092 --> 41:00.227
Yeah, of course you are.

41:00.327 --> 41:01.528
We can't wait to
agree to that bout.

41:01.628 --> 41:03.130
Now, Reiss is
ready to sign ASAP.

41:03.230 --> 41:04.731
He wants to redeem himself
and prove to the world

41:04.831 --> 41:07.134
that it was just a fluke.

41:07.234 --> 41:08.135
Yeah.

41:08.235 --> 41:09.036
Well, yeah.

41:09.136 --> 41:11.204
I mean, he'll get it.

41:11.304 --> 41:11.905
You know.

41:15.242 --> 41:17.611
But?

41:17.711 --> 41:18.845
The truth is this.

41:18.945 --> 41:21.882
Stone had a hard time
making the cut at 205.

41:21.982 --> 41:23.417
So he's moving up
to heavyweight,

41:23.517 --> 41:25.686
and he's going to
challenge Ferguson.

41:25.786 --> 41:26.720
Right?

41:26.820 --> 41:28.321
I mean, the whole
champ-champ thing...

41:28.422 --> 41:29.656
you know, you can't blame him.

41:29.756 --> 41:31.692
Everyone wants to
do that right now.

41:31.792 --> 41:35.262
But I want Reiss
to fight Nightmare.

41:35.362 --> 41:36.096
Nightmare?

41:36.195 --> 41:36.963
Yeah.

41:37.064 --> 41:37.998
We just signed him.

41:38.098 --> 41:39.232
But Max, we want Randy Stone.

41:39.332 --> 41:41.501
Yeah, but I'm not
offering you Stone.

41:48.742 --> 41:50.510
Max, we've always
stepped out for you, right?

41:50.610 --> 41:51.878
Mm-hmm.

41:51.978 --> 41:52.913
You've needed us to
fight on three weeks' notice.

41:53.013 --> 41:54.047
We've done it.

41:54.147 --> 41:55.315
Two weeks' notice.
We've done it.

41:55.415 --> 41:56.216
- Yep.
- Up in weight, we've done it.

41:56.316 --> 41:57.417
You guys are the best.

41:57.517 --> 41:58.218
Down in
weight, we've done it.

41:58.318 --> 41:59.386
- Yep.
- Right?

41:59.486 --> 42:00.120
Reiss has always
been a company man.

42:00.220 --> 42:01.388
Yep.

42:01.488 --> 42:02.255
strap
for nearly five years.

42:02.355 --> 42:03.156
Yes.

42:03.290 --> 42:04.391
He deserves a rematch.

42:04.491 --> 42:07.227
Reggie, you and I
both know the money

42:07.327 --> 42:09.730
fight is Stone-Ferguson.

42:09.830 --> 42:10.931
The money fight...

42:11.031 --> 42:12.733
but this is about the
right fight, though, Max.

42:12.833 --> 42:13.734
Right fight?

42:13.834 --> 42:15.569
What is this, Mr.
Rogers' playhouse?

42:15.669 --> 42:17.170
What are we in
kindergarten, Reggie?

42:17.270 --> 42:19.172
Grow the fuck up.

42:19.272 --> 42:20.307
OK.

42:20.407 --> 42:23.110
So what if we lose?

42:23.211 --> 42:24.311
Wow.

42:24.411 --> 42:25.812
You got that much
faith in him, huh?

42:25.912 --> 42:27.981
Max, it's not about faith.

42:28.081 --> 42:29.149
I'm being realistic.

42:29.249 --> 42:31.284
Look, Nightmare is
a dangerous fight.

42:31.384 --> 42:33.019
If we lose that fight,
that's two losses in a row.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.488
You know that.

42:34.588 --> 42:36.723
It's a bad fight for us.

42:36.823 --> 42:38.658
Look, if Randy Stone is
too heavy for the division,

42:38.759 --> 42:39.426
then strip him.

42:39.526 --> 42:40.460
I'm not gonna strip him.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.329
Create an interim title, then.

42:42.429 --> 42:43.730
I'm not going to do that.

42:43.830 --> 42:45.365
Max, who's running this
fucking company, you know?

42:45.465 --> 42:46.399
You or Randy Stone?

42:46.500 --> 42:47.901
Where are your fucking balls at?

42:48.001 --> 42:49.603
I've done a pretty
good job without balls,

42:49.703 --> 42:51.037
wouldn't you say, Reggie?
- I don't know.

42:51.138 --> 42:52.305
I think that the
Max Black I know

42:52.405 --> 42:53.774
would have told him
to go fuck himself.

42:53.874 --> 42:55.108
Yeah.

42:55.209 --> 42:56.610
Well, you're lucky the Max
Black is in a good mood today,

42:56.710 --> 42:59.045
or else I might tell
you to go fuck yourself.

42:59.146 --> 43:02.382
Listen, man, we go
way back, right?

43:02.482 --> 43:04.351
I know you're just
trying to do your job.

43:04.451 --> 43:06.186
Well, give me a fucking break.

43:06.286 --> 43:07.487
That's what I'm
trying to do here.

43:07.587 --> 43:09.223
I'm just trying to do my job.

43:09.356 --> 43:11.259
And the truth is, the
Stone-Ferguson thing

43:11.358 --> 43:12.392
is set already.

43:12.492 --> 43:14.995
So basically, you
got two choices.

43:15.095 --> 43:18.598
If you believe Reiss could win,
you have him fight Nightmare.

43:21.301 --> 43:23.436
What's the second
choice, then?

43:23.537 --> 43:24.638
Reiss sit on the shelf.

43:29.176 --> 43:29.743
All right, Max.

43:29.843 --> 43:30.310
Thank you.

43:30.410 --> 43:30.911
All right?

43:31.011 --> 43:31.778
Yeah.

43:31.878 --> 43:32.445
We cool?

43:32.546 --> 43:33.214
We're good.

43:33.313 --> 43:34.282
All right, man.

43:34.381 --> 43:35.582
All right, man.
- Take it easy.

43:35.682 --> 43:36.483
- Fred, see ya later.
- Give Reiss my love.

43:36.583 --> 43:37.117
I'll give you a call.

43:37.218 --> 43:39.052
Yeah.

43:42.290 --> 43:43.089
Who else we got?

43:43.190 --> 43:44.624
OK.

43:44.724 --> 43:45.293
Drake.

43:45.392 --> 43:46.726
Are you kidding me?

43:46.827 --> 43:47.794
Which side?

43:47.894 --> 43:48.962
Whoever's side we're
going to put him on,

43:49.062 --> 43:49.863
they're going to hate us.

43:49.963 --> 43:51.364
Pivot couple of Ryans.

43:51.464 --> 43:52.199
Are they coming?

43:52.300 --> 43:53.466
Yeah, both Ryans.

43:53.567 --> 43:54.801
Well, fucking put
Ryan in the front row.

43:54.901 --> 43:55.569
OK, Ryans.

43:55.669 --> 43:56.870
Put Ryan Gosling near me.

43:56.970 --> 43:57.838
Yeah, I'm on it.

43:58.772 --> 44:00.241
No fucking way.

44:00.340 --> 44:01.675
No way.

44:01.775 --> 44:03.311
Marcus, it's the only fight
Max is willing to offer.

44:03.410 --> 44:04.177
Yo, Reggie, tell him.

44:04.278 --> 44:06.012
It's true, Marcus.

44:06.112 --> 44:06.980
Then you wait.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.249
It could be a whole year.

44:08.348 --> 44:10.617
Then he spends some
time with this kid.

44:10.717 --> 44:13.954
Stone and Ferguson fight,
we start talking trash,

44:14.054 --> 44:15.155
we get our rematch.

44:15.256 --> 44:16.623
I'm not waiting a year.

44:16.723 --> 44:18.091
We're not taking
the Nightmare fight.

44:18.191 --> 44:19.227
Why not?

44:19.327 --> 44:21.127
He's less popular.

44:21.229 --> 44:23.331
He's more dangerous.

44:23.430 --> 44:25.732
Quite frankly, it's
a bad match for you.

44:25.832 --> 44:27.901
If I was the champ, I'd
have to fight him anyway.

44:28.001 --> 44:29.402
So what's the difference?

44:29.502 --> 44:31.838
If you're champ, the
juice is worth the squeeze.

44:31.938 --> 44:34.107
Yeah, we're talking back end
points on pay-per-view, bigger

44:34.208 --> 44:36.277
show money, and more PR, Reiss.

44:36.376 --> 44:37.811
You know, I'm
not afraid of him.

44:37.911 --> 44:38.912
He's hungry.

44:39.012 --> 44:39.813
He's dangerous.

44:39.913 --> 44:41.014
Oh, yeah.

44:41.114 --> 44:43.049
His last fight, he
broke a guy's..

44:43.149 --> 44:44.551
He's retired now.

44:44.651 --> 44:47.087
Reiss, can't you see
what Max is trying to do?

44:47.187 --> 44:51.259
She's trying to use you to
build her young fighter.

44:51.359 --> 44:52.559
You deserve better than that.

44:52.659 --> 44:55.329
She's throwing
you to the wolves.

44:55.428 --> 44:56.297
I'm a wolf.

44:56.396 --> 44:58.232
You're not listening.

44:58.332 --> 44:59.199
We're not taking the fight.

44:59.300 --> 45:01.768
That's final.

45:02.869 --> 45:05.273
Yeah, I had a
feeling you'd say that.

45:05.373 --> 45:06.673
I'm going to LA.

45:06.773 --> 45:08.276
I'm going to do this
camp with Tony Gunn.

45:08.376 --> 45:09.609
LA?

45:09.709 --> 45:11.478
Reiss, you don't
need to go to LA.

45:11.578 --> 45:12.213
Are you serious?

45:12.313 --> 45:12.879
Reiss!

45:20.086 --> 45:22.923
makes me a little nervous.

45:23.023 --> 45:24.325
Hard leg kick again.

45:24.424 --> 45:27.328
Oh, that's a knockout.

45:27.427 --> 45:29.330
That's it.

45:29.429 --> 45:31.332
A hard, hard punch.

45:31.431 --> 45:33.099
Knockout.

45:33.199 --> 45:38.905
Unfortunately,..

45:53.254 --> 45:57.023
Every day just the same,
wake up, train, feel the pain.

45:57.123 --> 45:59.025
Lift that weight up
off the block 'cause

45:59.125 --> 46:00.560
I'm never going to stop.

46:00.660 --> 46:02.363
I'm physically intimidated.

46:02.462 --> 46:04.164
Never.

46:04.265 --> 46:05.699
Looking for my next opponent.

46:05.799 --> 46:07.467
Now it's time to push up on it.

46:07.567 --> 46:09.236
Let that shit roll on the mat.

46:09.337 --> 46:11.071
Double on your back.

46:11.171 --> 46:12.672
No problem making weight...

46:12.772 --> 46:13.974
4 more.

46:14.074 --> 46:15.343
Sorry.

46:15.443 --> 46:18.044
I must have carried some extra
weight on the..

46:18.144 --> 46:19.546
Come on, that's no excuse.

46:19.646 --> 46:21.248
You're a professional.

46:21.349 --> 46:21.948
Let's go.

46:22.048 --> 46:22.983
Come on.

46:23.083 --> 46:24.318
I'm dropping
bombs

46:24.418 --> 46:26.486
when I rock up in your city.

46:26.586 --> 46:30.890
Fight dirty, flight clean,
yo, I'm making gritty.

46:30.991 --> 46:31.524
Come on.

46:31.624 --> 46:33.093
Back on the bike.

46:33.193 --> 46:36.196
I hit that fool hard
and finish like a..

46:36.297 --> 46:38.131
I'm dropping bombs
when I take off,

46:38.232 --> 46:39.866
when I rock up in your city.

46:39.966 --> 46:43.337
Fight dirty, fight clean,
yo, I'm making gritty.

46:43.437 --> 46:44.704
Step up in your business.

46:44.804 --> 46:46.273
I step up to that plate.

46:46.374 --> 46:48.074
I hit that fool hard...

46:48.174 --> 46:49.042
Come on, let's go.

46:49.142 --> 46:49.576
A few more.

46:49.676 --> 46:50.543
Tony.

46:50.643 --> 46:51.511
I'm not calling it.

46:51.611 --> 46:53.013
We're calling it.

46:53.113 --> 46:55.181
No.

46:55.282 --> 46:57.717
Reiss, it's not worth it.

46:57.817 --> 46:59.253
We're not calling it, Ellie.

47:02.155 --> 47:02.622
Come on.

47:02.722 --> 47:03.257
Let's get going.

47:06.726 --> 47:09.397
I'm like a big
snake, a little too strong.

47:09.497 --> 47:10.797
Like a python in an octagon.

47:10.897 --> 47:12.565
I'm gonna hunt you out
because there ain't no quit.

47:12.665 --> 47:13.933
My face unmarked
'cause I don't get hit.

47:14.034 --> 47:15.869
Try and take me down,
I'll pop right up.

47:15.969 --> 47:17.804
I'll run for you
like a dumping truck.

47:17.904 --> 47:19.473
I lift, I roll, I bob, I weave.

47:19.572 --> 47:20.940
I do it all to protect my dream.

47:21.041 --> 47:22.476
I'm gonna take that
title, defend it too.

47:22.575 --> 47:23.576
That's eight straight wins.

47:23.676 --> 47:24.478
That's how we do.

47:24.577 --> 47:25.312
I hear the crowd.

47:25.413 --> 47:26.480
I like that sound.

47:26.579 --> 47:28.014
Now I'm the top dog,
pound for pound.

47:28.114 --> 47:28.748
Take me down.

47:28.848 --> 47:29.716
My skills be quick.

47:29.816 --> 47:30.583
You think you're special?

47:30.683 --> 47:31.651
I'll make you quit.

47:31.751 --> 47:32.752
That
give me a taste.

47:32.852 --> 47:33.920
Where's Dana White?

47:34.020 --> 47:35.722
Put the belt around
my waist, yo.

47:35.822 --> 47:37.657
I'm dropping bombs in octagons
when I rock up in your city...

47:37.757 --> 47:39.293
Got anything left in you?

47:39.393 --> 47:40.461
Got these last two?

47:40.560 --> 47:43.531
Tony, he's finished.

47:43.630 --> 47:45.533
Let him answer.

47:45.632 --> 47:46.566
Reiss.

47:46.666 --> 47:49.470
My body won't sweat anymore.

47:49.569 --> 47:51.238
I'm done, Tony.

47:51.338 --> 47:56.176
You do realize you'll be
giving up 20% of your purse.

47:56.277 --> 47:56.843
Yeah.

48:00.613 --> 48:02.082
Fine.

48:02.182 --> 48:03.883
My fee stays the same.

48:03.983 --> 48:06.586
We train that
shit together, fool.

48:06.686 --> 48:08.154
You know I finish fights.

48:08.255 --> 48:09.722
I'm dropping bombs.

48:22.669 --> 48:24.572
What's up?

48:24.671 --> 48:28.108
I'm not used to
sharing a locker room.

48:28.209 --> 48:30.743
That's what you get
when you're not the champ.

48:30.844 --> 48:32.346
A roomful of dicks and ass.

48:36.517 --> 48:38.685
Looking good out there, Corey.

48:38.785 --> 48:41.988
All right, next time, man.

48:42.088 --> 48:43.257
Dude.

48:43.357 --> 48:44.190
MCL?

48:44.291 --> 48:45.426
Doc said eight weeks.

48:45.526 --> 48:47.361
I'd give it 10,
just to be safe.

48:47.461 --> 48:48.395
Definitely, Max.

48:48.496 --> 48:49.129
Owie.

48:49.230 --> 48:50.464
That sucks.

48:50.564 --> 48:52.699
Oh, man, you fought
your ass off.

48:52.799 --> 48:55.068
Those judges were bullshit.

48:55.168 --> 48:55.902
We'll run it back.

48:56.002 --> 48:57.103
All right?

48:57.204 --> 48:57.904
Good fighting.

48:58.004 --> 48:58.771
A little something for you.

49:02.409 --> 49:03.076
Hey, Tony.

49:03.176 --> 49:03.776
How you doing?

49:03.877 --> 49:05.246
Good to see you, Max.

49:05.346 --> 49:07.481
Sorry about the weight.

49:07.581 --> 49:08.582
What happened?

49:08.681 --> 49:10.016
It's just a really tough cut.

49:10.116 --> 49:10.950
I'm sorry.

49:11.050 --> 49:12.919
Do we need to
move you to heavy?

49:13.019 --> 49:13.621
Hell, no.

49:13.720 --> 49:15.121
Those guys are monsters.

49:15.222 --> 49:17.224
Big boys.

49:17.324 --> 49:18.392
All right.

49:18.492 --> 49:19.393
Well, this can't
happen again, Reiss.

49:19.493 --> 49:20.059
I know.

49:30.604 --> 49:31.804
Marcus, what are you doing here?

49:31.905 --> 49:33.340
I got
fight in the prelims.

49:33.440 --> 49:34.241
Oh, no way.

49:34.341 --> 49:35.209
That's amazing.

49:35.309 --> 49:35.775
Yeah.

49:35.875 --> 49:36.776
First pro fight.

49:36.876 --> 49:38.778
How'd you get on?

49:38.878 --> 49:41.282
Won by split decision.

49:41.382 --> 49:43.517
Man, that adrenaline dump.

49:43.617 --> 49:45.252
Yeah, you'll get
used to it, man.

49:45.352 --> 49:47.454
I'm proud of you.

49:47.555 --> 49:48.455
Marcus.

49:48.556 --> 49:49.122
Tony.

49:51.824 --> 49:52.725
Do your thing, brother.

49:55.762 --> 49:56.330
Congrats.

50:00.767 --> 50:02.035
That's Marcus, huh?

50:02.135 --> 50:03.637
Yeah.

50:03.736 --> 50:06.307
Pretty serious.

50:46.145 --> 50:49.048
Reiss is getting
absolutely pummeled.

50:49.148 --> 50:51.619
Nightmare is just hammering
him against the cage.

50:51.719 --> 50:52.419
Reiss, you gotta go.

50:52.519 --> 50:53.621
Come on.

50:53.721 --> 50:55.021
Reiss
opted to fly out to LA

50:55.121 --> 50:57.023
and do this camp with Tony
Gunn, one of the rising

50:57.123 --> 50:59.759
stars in the world of coaching.

50:59.859 --> 51:01.462
Tony is not looking
pleased right now.

51:01.562 --> 51:03.330
Hey, who's the joke now?

51:03.430 --> 51:05.232
Randy Stone
is in attendance tonight.

51:05.332 --> 51:08.602
Randy of course has his big
pay-per-view heavyweight title

51:08.702 --> 51:09.969
fight coming up with Ferguson.

51:12.373 --> 51:14.708
You're running around
this cage like a clown.

51:14.807 --> 51:16.142
Oh, shut up, man.

51:16.243 --> 51:17.611
Changing your
camp is going to throw off...

51:17.711 --> 51:19.446
Hey, use your distance.

51:19.546 --> 51:20.347
Calm down.

51:20.447 --> 51:21.548
Breathe.

51:21.649 --> 51:23.116
...right
now, before taking

51:23.217 --> 51:25.753
on Nightmare, the scariest human
being in Legends promotion.

51:25.852 --> 51:26.919
Get the fuck out
of there, Reiss.

51:27.020 --> 51:28.522
What are you doing?

51:28.622 --> 51:31.024
Reiss missed weight
for this fight, the first time

51:31.124 --> 51:32.326
in his career he's
missed weight.

51:32.426 --> 51:34.762
Nightmare, of course,
was kind enough to make

51:34.861 --> 51:36.230
this fight a catchweight.

51:36.330 --> 51:38.599
I wouldn't
call that kind, Bobby.

51:38.699 --> 51:40.199
Look at the size
of him in there.

51:40.301 --> 51:43.169
He's huge.

51:44.371 --> 51:45.872
Reiss is on the mat.

51:45.972 --> 51:49.743
He's trying to get
Nightmare to do jujitsu.

51:49.842 --> 51:50.910
Come on.

51:51.010 --> 51:52.446
Reiss, no one's
here for that shit.

51:52.546 --> 51:53.681
What are you doing?

51:53.781 --> 51:54.648
Boo!

51:54.748 --> 51:55.683
It's shocking.

51:55.783 --> 51:56.350
He's not even doing anything.

51:56.450 --> 51:57.217
Come on!

51:57.318 --> 51:59.320
Let's go.

51:59.420 --> 52:01.422
Nightmare is
actually taunting Reiss.

52:01.522 --> 52:04.824
And the referee has stepped
in and is standing Reiss up.

52:04.924 --> 52:07.126
They're forcing the fight
back to the stand-up.

52:07.227 --> 52:09.596
The crowd is clearly
unhappy with this display.

52:18.838 --> 52:19.839
Reiss, come on.
Out of the corner.

52:19.939 --> 52:21.174
Out of the corner, man.

52:21.275 --> 52:22.209
Reiss really
looks like he doesn't

52:22.309 --> 52:23.310
want to be in there right now.

52:23.410 --> 52:24.545
He's even moving step.

52:24.645 --> 52:27.046
It just looks like something's
not right with him.

52:27.146 --> 52:28.981
And Nightmare's
throwing his hands up...

52:29.082 --> 52:30.317
We came here to fight!

52:30.417 --> 52:31.585
...shouting to the crowd.

52:31.685 --> 52:32.820
He's
Reiss right now.

52:32.919 --> 52:33.520
Get in there.

52:33.620 --> 52:34.688
Let's go.

52:34.788 --> 52:36.256
Hey, who's the joke now?

52:36.357 --> 52:38.625
Randy Stone
is up, out of his seat,

52:38.726 --> 52:40.327
and shouting at him.

52:40.427 --> 52:42.730
The crowd is screaming for
Reiss Gibbons to engage.

52:42.830 --> 52:47.501
Come on, get
your head in the game.

52:47.601 --> 52:48.469
Look at him.

52:48.569 --> 52:50.771
He's embarrassing you.

52:50.870 --> 52:52.339
Get in there!

52:52.439 --> 52:54.675
Come on!

52:54.775 --> 52:55.676
Come on, Reiss!

52:55.776 --> 52:56.844
Reiss, come on!

52:56.943 --> 52:58.144
Reiss
fires..

52:58.245 --> 53:00.781
Nightmare follows up
with a vast counter.

53:00.880 --> 53:03.250
This is starting to
get embarrassing.

53:06.953 --> 53:08.522
Hey, Reiss, would you fight?

53:12.593 --> 53:14.361
Look at your boy!

53:14.461 --> 53:15.094
Knockout!

53:36.383 --> 53:39.919
I'm here with the former
Light Heavyweight Legends

53:40.019 --> 53:42.489
Champion, Reiss Gibbons.

53:42.589 --> 53:44.957
I hate asking questions right
after a knockout, Reiss.

53:45.057 --> 53:47.294
But again, how are
you feeling right now?

53:50.129 --> 53:51.598
I've been around a long time.

53:51.698 --> 53:54.435
And, you know, I've fought
the best of the best.

53:58.405 --> 53:59.740
I think it's the
last time you're

53:59.840 --> 54:02.242
going to see me in the cage.

54:02.342 --> 54:03.710
What,
are you saying you're

54:03.811 --> 54:05.279
ready to retire right now?

54:07.614 --> 54:10.651
I never started this
sport to be average.

54:10.751 --> 54:17.224
I wanted to be the best,
and I no longer am the best.

54:17.324 --> 54:21.027
So I want to say thank you to my
coach for this camp, Tony Gunn.

54:25.164 --> 54:26.600
Where's my coach?

54:26.700 --> 54:28.802
It's been an
honor to announce your flights

54:28.902 --> 54:29.937
all these years, Reiss.

54:30.036 --> 54:31.772
Sorry to see you
go out like this.

54:31.872 --> 54:33.740
We wish you nothing
but the best.

54:33.841 --> 54:36.710
Reiss Gibbons,
ladies and gentlemen.

54:52.191 --> 54:54.193
Where the fuck did you go?

54:54.294 --> 54:56.830
I'm not sticking
around for that shit.

54:56.930 --> 54:58.332
What do you mean?

54:58.432 --> 54:59.700
What do I mean?

54:59.800 --> 55:01.869
It's nice to be the last fucking
person in the entire arena

55:01.969 --> 55:03.035
who knows you're retiring.

55:03.135 --> 55:04.438
A waste of my fucking time.

55:04.538 --> 55:07.307
And what the fuck were
you doing out there?

55:07.407 --> 55:09.877
Everything we worked on,
everything we trained...

55:09.977 --> 55:11.945
you did nothing.

55:12.044 --> 55:13.179
Nothing.

55:13.280 --> 55:15.849
Where the fuck were you?

55:15.949 --> 55:16.850
I'm out of here.

55:16.950 --> 55:18.452
Good luck to you.

56:16.977 --> 56:19.413
You're a
million miles away.

56:31.525 --> 56:33.125
I don't think I
got anymore, Ellie.

56:51.878 --> 56:52.713
What happens next?

56:56.049 --> 56:58.352
Whatever we want.

56:58.452 --> 57:03.090
We could get that farm
we've always dreamed of, hm?

57:03.189 --> 57:04.758
I could get a horse.

57:08.762 --> 57:11.098
What the hell are we
going to do with a horse?

57:11.197 --> 57:13.300
I've always wanted a horse.

57:25.078 --> 57:28.081
Reiss, what's up, bro?

57:28.180 --> 57:30.050
I know you always get
mad when I do this, Roy,

57:30.149 --> 57:32.853
but I want to pull
some of my money out.

57:32.953 --> 57:38.392
Reiss, when was
the last time you

57:38.492 --> 57:40.560
took a look at your finances?

57:40.661 --> 57:41.595
I don't know.

57:41.695 --> 57:42.996
I don't deal with
that side of things.

57:43.096 --> 57:43.997
You're in the red.

57:44.097 --> 57:45.899
That can't be right.

57:45.999 --> 57:47.434
I'm afraid it is.

57:47.534 --> 57:48.902
What about the account I
put aside for when I get old?

57:49.002 --> 57:50.137
You kept dipping into it.

57:50.237 --> 57:53.774
That Swiss account?

57:53.874 --> 57:54.441
Take a look.

58:02.149 --> 58:04.685
You were supposed
to take care of me.

58:04.785 --> 58:05.952
I'm not your dad, bruv.

58:06.053 --> 58:06.953
I'm here to advise you.

58:07.054 --> 58:08.588
Then where was the advice?

58:08.689 --> 58:11.391
You had one job, one
fucking job, Reggie.

58:11.491 --> 58:12.626
Take care of my money.

58:12.726 --> 58:13.393
Where is that now?

58:13.493 --> 58:15.028
Reiss, you don't listen.

58:15.128 --> 58:16.863
Look, can you sit down?

58:16.963 --> 58:18.565
Reiss, sit down, bruv.

58:23.737 --> 58:24.971
Now, listen.

58:25.072 --> 58:27.074
Your were too high.

58:27.174 --> 58:28.642
Sponsorship deals,
they're finned.

58:28.742 --> 58:30.377
Pay-per-view back end, that went
out the window when you lost

58:30.477 --> 58:33.613
the belt. Bruv, flying
your whole family to LA

58:33.714 --> 58:35.682
for that extravagant
purchase, first class,

58:35.782 --> 58:37.818
for this Nightmare training
camp you didn't even need.

58:37.918 --> 58:39.453
Look, eventually the
money is going to run out

58:39.553 --> 58:40.654
when it's no longer coming in.

58:40.754 --> 58:41.988
It's that simple.

58:42.089 --> 58:43.356
And the poor
investments you made...

58:43.457 --> 58:45.792
the CBD oil, the high-tech
start-up companies.

58:45.892 --> 58:49.396
Bruv, they all went
bust within a year.

58:49.496 --> 58:50.597
And I told you not to do that.

58:53.600 --> 58:55.635
I'm never going back
to that life, Reggie.

58:55.736 --> 58:56.536
I know.

58:56.636 --> 58:59.806
Ellie is going to freak out.

58:59.906 --> 59:00.574
What do I do?

59:03.510 --> 59:04.945
You gotta tell her the truth.

59:05.045 --> 59:05.779
She's going to find out.

1:00:55.355 --> 1:00:58.292
This is definitely authentic?

1:00:58.425 --> 1:01:01.561
Can't get that
label anywhere else.

1:01:01.661 --> 1:01:02.796
How come you're selling them?

1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:08.869
Are you OK to do
a bank transfer?

1:01:08.969 --> 1:01:09.569
Yeah.

1:01:15.343 --> 1:01:15.909
Thanks.

1:01:23.984 --> 1:01:26.820
Well, thank you.

1:01:56.082 --> 1:01:57.218
Nice to meet you, man.

1:01:57.318 --> 1:01:57.884
Big fan.

1:01:57.984 --> 1:01:58.451
Big fan.

1:02:00.954 --> 1:02:01.922
Nice, man.

1:02:02.022 --> 1:02:03.924
My nephew, you're
his favorite fighter.

1:02:04.024 --> 1:02:05.226
His name's Kyle.

1:02:05.326 --> 1:02:06.394
What's your name, bro?

1:02:06.493 --> 1:02:07.060
Jerome, man.

1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:07.894
Jerome.

1:02:07.994 --> 1:02:08.428
I'm Darryl, man.

1:02:08.528 --> 1:02:09.896
I'm Darryl.

1:02:09.996 --> 1:02:12.032
Yeah, the fight with Anderson
was his favorite, yeah?

1:02:12.132 --> 1:02:13.066
Yo.

1:02:15.336 --> 1:02:16.603
Say something to
the camera, man.

1:02:16.703 --> 1:02:18.372
, stay
in school, man.

1:02:18.471 --> 1:02:19.373
Be good, OK?

1:02:19.472 --> 1:02:21.641
Yeah, yeah.

1:02:21.741 --> 1:02:22.343
Yo, man.

1:02:22.442 --> 1:02:23.377
I appreciate it, man.

1:02:23.476 --> 1:02:24.412
, man.

1:02:24.511 --> 1:02:26.347
You mean the world to us, man.

1:02:26.446 --> 1:02:27.514
Five-time champ, man.

1:02:27.614 --> 1:02:30.984
Five times!

1:02:32.386 --> 1:02:32.986
Pleasure.

1:02:36.056 --> 1:02:38.359
Yes!

1:02:56.977 --> 1:02:58.245
Reiss.

1:02:58.346 --> 1:03:01.248
Go back to sleep, baby.

1:03:32.213 --> 1:03:34.814
Reiss, get dressed.

1:03:34.914 --> 1:03:37.351
Bruv, it's 6:30
in the morning.

1:03:37.451 --> 1:03:38.685
Yeah, I know.

1:03:38.785 --> 1:03:39.819
And Ferguson's out of
the Randy Stone fight.

1:03:39.919 --> 1:03:40.321
What?

1:03:40.421 --> 1:03:41.355
I know.

1:03:41.455 --> 1:03:42.256
Look, Reiss, this is our chance.

1:03:42.356 --> 1:03:43.224
You can get a rematch.

1:03:43.324 --> 1:03:44.291
I'm retired.

1:03:44.392 --> 1:03:45.326
Retirement?

1:03:45.426 --> 1:03:46.526
Reiss, stop talking nonsense.

1:03:46.626 --> 1:03:47.527
Look, I've been calling
Max all morning.

1:03:47.627 --> 1:03:48.795
What did she say?

1:03:48.895 --> 1:03:50.063
Well, she hasn't
returned my calls yet,

1:03:50.163 --> 1:03:52.500
but that's 'cause
she needs convincing.

1:03:52.599 --> 1:03:54.067
The fight's in a few weeks.

1:03:54.167 --> 1:03:56.169
Reiss, you've taken a fight
on a week's notice before.

1:03:56.270 --> 1:03:57.137
Come on.

1:03:57.238 --> 1:03:58.104
Get your head in the game.

1:03:58.205 --> 1:03:58.838
My head's not in it, man.

1:03:58.938 --> 1:03:59.240
Oh, Reiss.

1:03:59.340 --> 1:04:00.106
Come on.

1:04:00.207 --> 1:04:01.074
Look, this is yours.

1:04:01.174 --> 1:04:01.574
This is your opportunity.

1:04:01.674 --> 1:04:03.109
I can't.

1:04:03.210 --> 1:04:04.278
What do you mean you can't?

1:04:04.378 --> 1:04:05.879
What's... Reiss,
this isn't you, man.

1:04:05.979 --> 1:04:06.546
Talk to me.

1:04:06.646 --> 1:04:08.249
I'm sorry, Reggie.

1:04:08.349 --> 1:04:09.049
See yourself out.

1:04:09.149 --> 1:04:09.517
Reiss, stop.

1:04:09.616 --> 1:04:10.518
Stop.

1:04:10.617 --> 1:04:11.252
Look, this isn't you, yeah?

1:04:11.352 --> 1:04:12.253
Alpha, man.

1:04:12.353 --> 1:04:13.421
Look, stop all the weakness.

1:04:13.521 --> 1:04:14.455
We'll sit down,
we'll have a coffee,

1:04:14.554 --> 1:04:15.423
and we'll talk about it, yeah?

1:04:15.523 --> 1:04:19.025
Reggie, see yourself out.

1:04:45.819 --> 1:04:48.489
Are you sure this is
what you want to do?

1:04:48.588 --> 1:04:49.189
Yes.

1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:54.961
Why are you turning this down?

1:04:55.061 --> 1:04:56.530
Ellie.

1:04:56.629 --> 1:05:01.901
Why are you turning this down?

1:05:02.001 --> 1:05:03.870
I don't want to fight anymore.

1:05:03.970 --> 1:05:04.371
Why?

1:05:10.344 --> 1:05:11.245
I'm afraid.

1:05:18.051 --> 1:05:18.618
Good.

1:05:22.223 --> 1:05:24.258
Finally you got
that out of the way.

1:05:27.361 --> 1:05:34.502
I have poured everything
I've got into this, into us.

1:05:34.602 --> 1:05:37.404
I've sacrificed everything.

1:05:37.505 --> 1:05:41.609
I've put my whole life on hold.

1:05:41.708 --> 1:05:42.309
Do you know why?

1:05:44.911 --> 1:05:46.646
Because I believe in you, Reiss.

1:06:08.335 --> 1:06:11.238
Luck has taken over.

1:06:11.338 --> 1:06:12.640
Lost along the way.

1:06:12.739 --> 1:06:16.243
a legend of late.

1:06:21.549 --> 1:06:23.883
I can't believe you have
the nerve to follow me here.

1:06:23.983 --> 1:06:25.151
- Look, Max...
- No.

1:06:25.252 --> 1:06:26.686
You haven't even
heard my question yet.

1:06:26.786 --> 1:06:27.787
I don't need to hear
your question, Reggie.

1:06:27.887 --> 1:06:28.955
The answer is no.

1:06:29.055 --> 1:06:30.558
Listen, Max, that's our fight.

1:06:30.658 --> 1:06:31.824
Oh, man.

1:06:31.925 --> 1:06:33.460
You know, you got a
lot of balls, right?

1:06:33.561 --> 1:06:36.162
First you lose the first two,
and then you officially retire?

1:06:36.263 --> 1:06:37.464
Fuck you.

1:06:37.565 --> 1:06:38.432
Look... listen, Max.

1:06:38.532 --> 1:06:40.033
It's a mistake, OK?

1:06:40.133 --> 1:06:41.000
It's Nightmare's fight.
Sorry.

1:06:41.100 --> 1:06:42.303
I'm announcing it right now.

1:06:42.403 --> 1:06:43.337
Max, just listen.
Max.

1:06:43.437 --> 1:06:44.338
- No.
- It's a mistake.

1:06:44.438 --> 1:06:45.939
You know what?

1:06:46.039 --> 1:06:46.906
Reggie, you're really bugging
the shit out of me right now.

1:06:47.006 --> 1:06:47.974
Just give me one minute.

1:06:48.074 --> 1:06:48.576
- No.
- Just I'll explain...

1:06:48.676 --> 1:06:49.709
No.

1:06:49.809 --> 1:06:50.611
Do you want me
to call security?

1:06:50.710 --> 1:06:51.378
You wouldn't do that.

1:06:51.478 --> 1:06:52.379
Yeah, I will.

1:06:52.479 --> 1:06:53.414
We've got 100 missed calls.

1:06:53.514 --> 1:06:54.548
I could arrest you for stalking.

1:06:54.648 --> 1:06:56.015
Well, if you
returned my calls,

1:06:56.115 --> 1:06:57.518
you wouldn't have so many
calls in the first place.

1:06:57.618 --> 1:06:59.620
Listen, I gave Reiss every
fucking chance there was.

1:06:59.719 --> 1:07:02.456
It broke my heart when
he lost that fight.

1:07:02.556 --> 1:07:03.890
I love the guy.

1:07:03.990 --> 1:07:05.426
But at a certain point, you
gotta draw the line, OK?

1:07:05.526 --> 1:07:06.427
It's just business, Reggie.

1:07:06.527 --> 1:07:07.160
Max.

1:07:07.261 --> 1:07:09.230
Max, please!

1:07:09.330 --> 1:07:09.929
Sorry.

1:07:10.029 --> 1:07:10.631
Are you fucking crazy?

1:07:10.730 --> 1:07:11.599
I'm sorry.

1:07:11.699 --> 1:07:12.198
But just hear me out, Max.

1:07:12.299 --> 1:07:13.099
OK.

1:07:13.199 --> 1:07:13.900
OK, listen.

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.269
You got 30 fucking seconds.

1:07:15.369 --> 1:07:15.768
Thank you.

1:07:15.868 --> 1:07:16.769
Look, Max.

1:07:16.869 --> 1:07:17.937
Look, you said it yourself.

1:07:18.037 --> 1:07:19.206
You love an underdog
story, right?

1:07:19.306 --> 1:07:20.907
Well, this is the
biggest underdog story

1:07:21.007 --> 1:07:22.075
in the history of Legends,
maybe in the history of MMA,

1:07:22.175 --> 1:07:23.277
all right.

1:07:23.377 --> 1:07:24.911
The first time they
fought, Reiss was the king,

1:07:25.011 --> 1:07:26.079
and he went through a
murderer's row to get there,

1:07:26.179 --> 1:07:27.281
went through so
much hell and back.

1:07:27.381 --> 1:07:28.382
And you've been there.
You've seen it.

1:07:28.482 --> 1:07:29.816
You know this, right?

1:07:29.916 --> 1:07:31.218
This time, the rolls are
completely reversed, right?

1:07:31.318 --> 1:07:32.686
He's the one who's got to
go through the trenches

1:07:32.785 --> 1:07:33.786
and he's got to
dig deep and he's

1:07:33.886 --> 1:07:34.921
got to win this time, right?

1:07:35.021 --> 1:07:36.523
The odds are
stacked against him,

1:07:36.624 --> 1:07:38.057
and there's only one fighter on
that roster that can sell out

1:07:38.157 --> 1:07:39.360
that arena within three
weeks time

1:07:39.460 --> 1:07:40.261
that you've got left.

1:07:40.361 --> 1:07:41.562
And that's Reiss, right?

1:07:41.662 --> 1:07:44.498
And Max, just like you, I'm
just trying to do my job,

1:07:44.598 --> 1:07:45.466
just like you are, right?

1:07:45.566 --> 1:07:46.933
That's all we can do, right?

1:07:47.033 --> 1:07:47.834
So what do you say?

1:07:51.705 --> 1:07:52.805
Your 30 seconds are up.

1:08:00.214 --> 1:08:00.681
Hey, man.

1:08:00.780 --> 1:08:02.283
How you doing?

1:08:02.383 --> 1:08:03.517
Nice to see you, too.

1:08:03.617 --> 1:08:04.784
Pleasure, as always.

1:08:04.884 --> 1:08:06.220
Hey, thanks
for having me on.

1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:07.020
Yeah.

1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:07.755
Thanks for making the time.

1:08:07.854 --> 1:08:10.457
Sure.

1:08:10.557 --> 1:08:13.661
So, Max, it's always
interesting to say the least

1:08:13.761 --> 1:08:15.262
when you come in the studio.

1:08:15.362 --> 1:08:17.797
Tell me, what's the
latest with Ferguson.

1:08:17.897 --> 1:08:18.699
He's injured.

1:08:18.798 --> 1:08:19.466
He's out of the fight.

1:08:19.566 --> 1:08:20.434
What's going on?

1:08:20.534 --> 1:08:22.101
Yeah, well, it's a drag.

1:08:22.201 --> 1:08:24.837
It's too bad, but the
MRI results came back.

1:08:24.937 --> 1:08:27.140
And, I mean, Ferguson's...

1:08:27.241 --> 1:08:28.141
he's out.

1:08:28.242 --> 1:08:29.042
He's out of the
fight completely, huh?

1:08:29.142 --> 1:08:30.377
Yeah, there's no way.

1:08:30.477 --> 1:08:31.545
I mean, it's going to
be at least nine months

1:08:31.645 --> 1:08:32.546
till he could fight again.

1:08:32.646 --> 1:08:33.547
He dropped this bombshell.

1:08:33.647 --> 1:08:34.548
Your main event is now off.

1:08:34.648 --> 1:08:35.915
Yeah.

1:08:36.015 --> 1:08:37.384
What does this mean
for the rest of the card?

1:08:37.484 --> 1:08:39.420
Well, I mean, come on.

1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:40.721
You know this business.

1:08:40.820 --> 1:08:42.188
The show must go on, right?

1:08:42.289 --> 1:08:43.490
Right, right.

1:08:43.590 --> 1:08:46.493
So you have an opponent in
mind for Randy Stone, then?

1:08:46.593 --> 1:08:47.528
Uh, yeah.

1:08:47.628 --> 1:08:48.329
Yes.

1:08:48.429 --> 1:08:49.330
Yes.

1:08:49.430 --> 1:08:51.365
Yes.

1:08:51.465 --> 1:08:52.700
Yes, I do.

1:08:52.800 --> 1:09:00.341
In just three weeks' time,
Randy Stone will be fighting...

1:09:00.441 --> 1:09:01.475
Come on.

1:09:01.575 --> 1:09:03.510
Come on.

1:09:03.610 --> 1:09:05.346
Randy Stone is going to
be fighting Reiss Gibbons.

1:09:05.446 --> 1:09:07.681
Are you
fucking shitting me?

1:09:07.781 --> 1:09:10.217
I just cost myself
advertising revenue.

1:09:10.317 --> 1:09:11.218
Shit.
- Woo!

1:09:11.318 --> 1:09:12.018
Fuck.

1:09:12.118 --> 1:09:12.919
I need to stop talking here.

1:09:13.019 --> 1:09:14.755
That's big fucking news.

1:09:14.854 --> 1:09:16.690
First, you drop
that Reiss is coming

1:09:16.790 --> 1:09:17.990
out of retirement,
moving to heavyweight,

1:09:18.091 --> 1:09:19.192
and now I'm speechless.

1:09:19.293 --> 1:09:20.461
Your spee...
well, that is a first.

1:09:39.713 --> 1:09:43.550
What are you doing
here, Hollywood?

1:09:43.650 --> 1:09:46.286
Yeah, I deserve that.

1:09:46.387 --> 1:09:48.087
I've been offered the
Randy Stone rematch.

1:09:50.724 --> 1:09:51.291
Yeah, I heard.

1:09:54.093 --> 1:09:56.663
Everyone's counting
me out against him.

1:09:56.764 --> 1:09:57.464
Everyone.

1:10:00.401 --> 1:10:02.935
What do you think?

1:10:03.035 --> 1:10:05.004
Now you care what I think?

1:10:05.104 --> 1:10:07.140
I think you shouldn't have
taken the Nightmare fight.

1:10:07.241 --> 1:10:09.743
I know.

1:10:09.843 --> 1:10:13.447
I hated watching that fight.

1:10:13.547 --> 1:10:15.649
You broke my heart, Reiss.

1:10:15.749 --> 1:10:16.583
I know I did, Marcus.

1:10:19.653 --> 1:10:21.488
But I need to know.

1:10:21.588 --> 1:10:22.456
Do you think I can take him?

1:10:32.299 --> 1:10:39.807
You cut one corner, pull
one Hollywood bullshit move,

1:10:39.907 --> 1:10:42.843
I'll kick your ass myself.

1:10:42.942 --> 1:10:44.043
You understand that?

1:10:51.752 --> 1:10:53.720
You can beat him on the ground.

1:10:53.821 --> 1:10:55.154
He hasn't been tested there.

1:10:55.255 --> 1:10:57.324
You need to take him
into deep waters.

1:11:02.930 --> 1:11:05.097
If you want to win
this fight, Reiss,

1:11:05.198 --> 1:11:06.567
you need to make it
a technical fight.

1:11:27.186 --> 1:11:29.323
I'm feeling
good about myself.

1:11:29.423 --> 1:11:31.225
I'm feeling good about
this charitable thing

1:11:31.325 --> 1:11:33.260
I'm doing, giving this
broke son of a bitch

1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:36.396
another chance at glory.

1:11:36.497 --> 1:11:38.064
You can talk about
your being charitable,

1:11:38.164 --> 1:11:39.233
but that's just talk.

1:11:39.333 --> 1:11:40.801
That's all you have
for this fight.

1:11:40.901 --> 1:11:43.937
I can grapple, I can strike,
I can take you to the ground.

1:11:44.036 --> 1:11:45.606
I'll beat you at
everything, all right?

1:11:45.706 --> 1:11:46.907
I'll beat you on the ground.

1:11:47.006 --> 1:11:48.040
I'll beat you on the feet.

1:11:48.140 --> 1:11:49.008
I'll beat you in wrestling.

1:11:49.108 --> 1:11:50.644
I'll beat you in jujitsu.

1:11:50.744 --> 1:11:52.178
I'll beat you in
chess, checkers,

1:11:52.279 --> 1:11:53.747
a fucking spelling bee.

1:11:53.847 --> 1:11:56.884
I'm better than you, Reiss.

1:11:56.984 --> 1:11:58.452
No more flukes.

1:11:58.552 --> 1:11:59.353
No more jokes.

1:11:59.453 --> 1:12:00.787
I'm stepping in there serious.

1:12:00.888 --> 1:12:02.389
I'm ready to throw down.

1:12:02.489 --> 1:12:03.924
I'm going to bring
that whole toolbox,

1:12:04.023 --> 1:12:05.659
and I'm gonna use it on you.

1:12:05.759 --> 1:12:08.495
Come fight night, I'm going to
show you, man, the real Reiss.

1:12:24.611 --> 1:12:26.446
You know, I know what
I did wrong last time.

1:12:26.547 --> 1:12:28.248
This time I'm gonna go in
there, and I'm gonna make

1:12:28.348 --> 1:12:29.917
sure I execute my game plan.

1:12:30.017 --> 1:12:31.218
I'm gonna finish it, man.

1:12:31.318 --> 1:12:34.120
Technically I knocked
your dick in the dirt.

1:12:34.221 --> 1:12:36.590
Technically I'm
the champion now.

1:12:36.690 --> 1:12:39.125
I'm the baddest man
in the world now.

1:12:39.226 --> 1:12:41.995
This will be the ugliest
fight of your life.

1:12:42.094 --> 1:12:44.731
He's stronger than you.

1:12:44.831 --> 1:12:46.165
He's meaner than you.

1:12:46.266 --> 1:12:49.269
But you have a bigger heart.

1:12:49.369 --> 1:12:50.470
You're a martial artist.

1:13:32.946 --> 1:13:35.616
Remember the Mitchell fight?

1:13:35.716 --> 1:13:36.583
Yeah.

1:13:36.683 --> 1:13:38.518
You knocked him out.

1:13:38.619 --> 1:13:42.656
Yeah, eventually.

1:13:42.756 --> 1:13:46.526
First time we fought
it didn't go so well.

1:13:46.627 --> 1:13:49.963
I underestimated him,
overlooked him, kind

1:13:50.063 --> 1:13:52.566
of similar to what you did.

1:13:52.666 --> 1:13:55.402
Not quite as bad.

1:13:55.502 --> 1:14:01.208
Hell, came back,.

1:14:01.308 --> 1:14:03.076
Took it serious.

1:14:03.175 --> 1:14:05.712
Like you do this time.

1:14:05.812 --> 1:14:11.485
You're better than him,
been doing it longer.

1:14:11.585 --> 1:14:14.688
Got more heart.

1:14:14.788 --> 1:14:19.926
Show all that out there,
and he can't beat you.

1:14:20.027 --> 1:14:24.498
So... you got it, man.

1:14:24.598 --> 1:14:25.465
You got this.

1:14:34.708 --> 1:14:37.044
And here
we go, the rematch

1:14:37.144 --> 1:14:38.445
we've all been waiting for.

1:14:38.545 --> 1:14:42.282
Randy Stone, Reiss Gibbons 2.

1:14:42.382 --> 1:14:44.451
Only a short time ago,
Reiss he announced

1:14:44.551 --> 1:14:47.521
his retirement after that
devastating loss to Nightmare.

1:14:47.621 --> 1:14:49.222
But here he is with
another opportunity

1:14:49.322 --> 1:14:52.259
to climb the mountain
again and redeem himself.

1:14:52.359 --> 1:14:53.927
Everybody is
counting Reiss Gibbons out.

1:14:54.027 --> 1:14:56.763
He's coming into this fight
as the clear underdog.

1:14:56.863 --> 1:14:58.365
Do you think he can do it?

1:14:58.465 --> 1:15:02.335
We'll soon find out, Bobby.

1:15:02.436 --> 1:15:08.141
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1:15:09.476 --> 1:15:12.179
Number one
in the..

1:15:12.279 --> 1:15:13.447
The storm has begun.

1:15:13.547 --> 1:15:15.749
The thunder taught
lightning

1:15:15.849 --> 1:15:16.750
with the force of the sun.

1:15:18.185 --> 1:15:19.853
Changed the course of the
game with a four-minute song.

1:15:21.488 --> 1:15:23.023
Because of course I'm the one
you got your formula from.

1:15:23.123 --> 1:15:25.125
Don't run the game
along.

1:15:25.225 --> 1:15:26.593
fortunate ones.

1:15:26.693 --> 1:15:28.395
I'm fortunate for the
warmongers that come for war.

1:15:28.495 --> 1:15:29.963
I stand tall when it's
all said and done.

1:15:30.063 --> 1:15:31.965
When the talking is done, you
went down with your talking

1:15:32.065 --> 1:15:35.435
I'm performer's
royalties all for the fun.

1:15:35.535 --> 1:15:37.070
Disgruntled flops.

1:15:37.170 --> 1:15:40.208
Wow,.

1:15:40.307 --> 1:15:41.141
Not just headstrong.

1:15:41.241 --> 1:15:42.375
Strong down to my calves.

1:15:42.476 --> 1:15:43.777
I'm on top of the
world..

1:15:46.446 --> 1:15:47.748
Knock them out.

1:15:47.848 --> 1:15:50.550
any town,
any bar, any..

1:15:50.650 --> 1:15:52.619
Whoa, whoa.

1:15:52.719 --> 1:15:56.289
I had a dream I would rise
through the sea, take flight.

1:15:56.389 --> 1:15:57.791
Now I see.

1:15:57.891 --> 1:15:59.159
Whoa, whoa.

1:15:59.259 --> 1:16:03.163
When you fight and believe and
strive to achieve any height

1:16:03.263 --> 1:16:04.131
you can reach.

1:16:04.232 --> 1:16:05.932
Whoa, whoa.

1:16:06.032 --> 1:16:10.504
I had a dream I would rise
through the sea, take flight...

1:16:10.604 --> 1:16:11.905
Reiss!

1:16:12.005 --> 1:16:15.475
Bouncing back from a
knockout is so tough.

1:16:15.575 --> 1:16:18.311
Can Reiss overcome the mental
demons he had to endure when he

1:16:18.411 --> 1:16:21.414
got knocked out by Randy Stone?

1:16:21.515 --> 1:16:24.184
This was his
first ever knockout.

1:16:24.284 --> 1:16:25.185
He had movie deals.

1:16:25.285 --> 1:16:26.319
He had sneaker deals.

1:16:26.419 --> 1:16:27.821
He had his own mouth guard.

1:16:27.921 --> 1:16:31.792
And in one night, one punch,
one man took it all away...

1:16:31.892 --> 1:16:32.359
Randy Stone.

1:16:35.229 --> 1:16:36.563
I can't
imagine what it

1:16:36.663 --> 1:16:38.266
feels like to be
Reiss Gibbons right

1:16:38.365 --> 1:16:40.667
now as Randy makes his walk.

1:16:40.767 --> 1:16:44.404
Reiss's heart must be
beating out of his chest.

1:16:44.504 --> 1:16:46.973
And of course, despite
being a heavyweight,

1:16:47.073 --> 1:16:49.843
Randy Stone doesn't have
to worry about making 205.

1:16:49.943 --> 1:16:51.812
He can come in at
his natural weight...

1:16:51.912 --> 1:16:54.815
stronger, meaner,
and more ferocious.

1:16:54.915 --> 1:16:56.883
What Reiss has
gone through in the past year

1:16:56.983 --> 1:16:58.585
is a roller coaster ride.

1:16:58.685 --> 1:17:01.289
And the big question,
can he battle back

1:17:01.388 --> 1:17:02.989
and reclaim his spot?

1:17:03.089 --> 1:17:04.124
We're moments away.

1:17:04.225 --> 1:17:06.359
Let's take it to our emcee.

1:17:13.099 --> 1:17:21.309
Ladies and gentlemen, it
is now time for our main event.

1:17:21.408 --> 1:17:24.611
The moment you've
all been waiting for,

1:17:24.711 --> 1:17:29.115
live from London, England!

1:17:29.217 --> 1:17:33.420
And brought to you by Lex.

1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:38.558
Are you ready for a new legend?

1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:51.605
This fight is scheduled
for five five-minute rounds

1:17:51.705 --> 1:17:57.444
for the vacant Heavyweight
Legends Champion of the World.

1:17:57.544 --> 1:18:03.351
Introducing first, he
hails from London, England,

1:18:03.450 --> 1:18:09.422
weighing in at 217
pounds, Reiss Gibbons.

1:18:12.692 --> 1:18:18.565
His opponent comes to
us via Cincinnati, Ohio.

1:18:18.665 --> 1:18:23.703
Weighing in at 235
pounds, the reigning,

1:18:23.803 --> 1:18:27.607
the defending Light
Heavyweight Legends Champion

1:18:27.707 --> 1:18:33.680
of the World, Randy Stone.

1:18:40.453 --> 1:18:41.955
Here we go.

1:18:42.055 --> 1:18:43.156
No more waiting.

1:18:43.257 --> 1:18:45.825
I cannot believe the
moment has finally arrived.

1:18:45.926 --> 1:18:49.330
The bad blood, the trash
talk, the tension so thick

1:18:49.429 --> 1:18:50.364
you can cut it with a knife...

1:18:50.463 --> 1:18:51.665
OK, gentlemen.

1:18:51.765 --> 1:18:53.267
We went over the rules
in the locker room.

1:18:53.367 --> 1:18:55.101
Any questions from
the challenger?

1:18:55.201 --> 1:18:57.203
Champion, any questions?

1:18:57.305 --> 1:18:59.206
Touch gloves if you want.

1:18:59.307 --> 1:19:00.774
Back to your corners.

1:19:03.677 --> 1:19:05.178
Come on,.

1:19:05.279 --> 1:19:06.146
Come on, Reiss.

1:19:09.649 --> 1:19:11.651
We are ready for war.

1:19:11.751 --> 1:19:12.118
Fight.

1:19:15.021 --> 1:19:16.756
And
Reiss springs at him

1:19:16.856 --> 1:19:19.526
and immediately presses
Randy Stone against the cage.

1:19:19.626 --> 1:19:20.860
He's a
man on a mission.

1:19:20.961 --> 1:19:23.463
What, are you gonna
hump my leg all night?

1:19:23.563 --> 1:19:25.799
Reiss is
wasting no time in there.

1:19:25.899 --> 1:19:29.769
We just don't know if we'll
see the champion from the past.

1:19:29.869 --> 1:19:32.505
Reiss is firing off
some great punches.

1:19:32.605 --> 1:19:34.208
Reiss is
really moving well.

1:19:34.308 --> 1:19:35.709
He's displaying
great head movement.

1:19:35.809 --> 1:19:37.445
He's looking really confident.

1:19:37.544 --> 1:19:39.280
And Reiss
lands a vicious takedown.

1:19:39.380 --> 1:19:40.448
There you go.

1:19:40.547 --> 1:19:42.450
And
control.

1:19:42.549 --> 1:19:44.452
Randy is so strong.

1:19:44.551 --> 1:19:46.019
He gets up right away.

1:19:52.092 --> 1:19:52.726
That's it, Reiss.

1:19:52.826 --> 1:19:54.395
Come on!

1:19:54.527 --> 1:19:55.562
Reiss
is showing a much

1:19:55.662 --> 1:19:56.963
improved arsenal of strikes.

1:19:57.063 --> 1:20:00.033
But Randy counters with
a great Superman punch,

1:20:00.133 --> 1:20:01.001
forcing Reiss to back up.

1:20:01.101 --> 1:20:01.701
Get off the cage!

1:20:05.272 --> 1:20:07.308
And Randy
tosses Reiss to the ground.

1:20:07.408 --> 1:20:09.042
He's just so powerful.

1:20:09.142 --> 1:20:11.011
Randy's
raining down punches.

1:20:11.111 --> 1:20:12.846
Reiss is throwing up
one submission attempt

1:20:12.946 --> 1:20:14.348
after another, but to no avail.

1:20:14.448 --> 1:20:15.882
Reiss, come on!

1:20:15.982 --> 1:20:17.351
Randy shrugs them
off like they were nothing.

1:20:17.451 --> 1:20:18.852
Signature
Danny Thicket.

1:20:18.952 --> 1:20:20.820
, and make them pay.

1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:22.822
Well, that's the
way it's looking right now.

1:20:22.922 --> 1:20:23.790
It may not be an issue if
he has to conserve himself.

1:20:23.890 --> 1:20:24.991
Come on.
Cover up.

1:20:31.298 --> 1:20:31.898
Reiss!

1:20:35.369 --> 1:20:36.603
Reiss looks hurt.

1:20:36.703 --> 1:20:38.472
Randy looks like he may
have torn something when

1:20:38.571 --> 1:20:40.840
he opened up Reiss's guard.

1:20:40.940 --> 1:20:42.642
Randy
just won't stop.

1:20:42.742 --> 1:20:46.213
He smells blood, and he's
going after him, Bobby.

1:20:46.313 --> 1:20:47.047
Come on.

1:20:47.147 --> 1:20:47.747
Get off the berm.

1:20:47.847 --> 1:20:48.948
Don't stay down there.

1:20:49.049 --> 1:20:50.750
No mercy.

1:20:50.850 --> 1:20:52.253
And Randy
Stone is the last guy

1:20:52.353 --> 1:20:54.154
you want on top of you when
you're not fighting well.

1:20:54.255 --> 1:20:57.525
It looks like something went
really wrong when Reiss tried

1:20:57.624 --> 1:20:59.726
to lock in that.

1:20:59.826 --> 1:21:01.228
We worked on this.

1:21:01.328 --> 1:21:04.731
Randy has such
vicious knees and elbows.

1:21:04.831 --> 1:21:06.099
Come on, Reiss.

1:21:06.199 --> 1:21:07.700
Get off of there.

1:21:07.801 --> 1:21:09.202
You gotta get off there.

1:21:09.303 --> 1:21:11.704
And Reiss just
looks completely manhandled.

1:21:11.805 --> 1:21:12.972
Reiss tries to escape.

1:21:13.073 --> 1:21:15.409
Randy locks him into
a guillotine choke.

1:21:15.509 --> 1:21:16.810
It looks tight.

1:21:16.910 --> 1:21:18.111
It
looks really tight.

1:21:18.212 --> 1:21:19.213
Hold on.

1:21:19.313 --> 1:21:20.747
This might
end the first round.

1:21:20.847 --> 1:21:22.416
And he's reaching for
a different position.

1:21:22.516 --> 1:21:24.751
He transitions to
a bulldog choke.

1:21:24.851 --> 1:21:26.586
I don't think he
can do anything.

1:21:26.686 --> 1:21:27.555
20 seconds left.

1:21:27.654 --> 1:21:29.122
Come on.

1:21:29.223 --> 1:21:30.657
Randy is pressing
down on the back of his neck.

1:21:30.757 --> 1:21:33.494
That's 235 pounds on the
back of Reiss's neck.

1:21:33.593 --> 1:21:34.694
With the right
amount of pressure,

1:21:34.794 --> 1:21:35.463
he could snap his neck.
- Don't tap.

1:21:35.563 --> 1:21:36.830
Don't you tap.

1:21:36.930 --> 1:21:38.232
Reiss is
holding on for dear life.

1:21:38.332 --> 1:21:40.200
I don't know how he's not
unconscious right now.

1:21:40.301 --> 1:21:41.569
TJ Steele is peering in.

1:21:41.668 --> 1:21:43.537
It looks like he's
trying to end this fight.

1:21:43.636 --> 1:21:45.306
Reiss is
in a lot of trouble.

1:21:45.406 --> 1:21:47.274
He does not look like he's
gonna get out of this.

1:21:47.374 --> 1:21:49.809
TJ Steele might
end this fight right now.

1:21:49.909 --> 1:21:51.778
Reiss is about to
go unconscious.

1:21:51.878 --> 1:21:53.947
I can't believe
he's still holding on.

1:21:54.981 --> 1:21:56.317
And
saved by the horn.

1:22:01.154 --> 1:22:03.524
I can't believe he
survived that round.

1:22:03.623 --> 1:22:04.558
Look at him.

1:22:04.657 --> 1:22:05.925
Reiss is clearly shaken by that.

1:22:06.025 --> 1:22:07.994
He's not even sure
what corner to go to.

1:22:08.094 --> 1:22:09.629
He doesn't
even know where he's at.

1:22:09.729 --> 1:22:11.131
He is completely out of it.

1:22:11.232 --> 1:22:12.699
And look at
the way he's walking.

1:22:12.799 --> 1:22:14.868
Something is clearly
wrong with Reiss' leg.

1:22:14.968 --> 1:22:16.636
Randy is basically mocking him.

1:22:16.736 --> 1:22:17.704
Take a deep breath.

1:22:17.804 --> 1:22:18.838
Deep breaths, buddy.

1:22:21.408 --> 1:22:22.276
Talk to me.

1:22:22.376 --> 1:22:23.410
What's going on?

1:22:27.515 --> 1:22:28.382
Can you fight?

1:22:28.482 --> 1:22:29.583
Should I stop it?

1:22:29.682 --> 1:22:31.151
No, don't fucking stop it.

1:22:31.252 --> 1:22:32.386
All right.

1:22:32.486 --> 1:22:34.588
Get ready to go in there
and start thinking about how

1:22:34.687 --> 1:22:36.022
you're gonna beat this guy.

1:22:36.122 --> 1:22:37.657
See him go to
the wrong quarter?

1:22:37.757 --> 1:22:39.293
He went to the wrong
fucking corner.

1:22:39.393 --> 1:22:40.494
The guy is lost.

1:22:40.594 --> 1:22:41.529
The guy has already lost.

1:22:41.629 --> 1:22:43.163
You keep those take-downs clean.

1:22:43.264 --> 1:22:43.997
Use your weight.

1:22:44.097 --> 1:22:45.198
John, you got anything for him?

1:22:45.299 --> 1:22:46.799
Those strikes,
they're nice and clean.

1:22:46.900 --> 1:22:48.735
Keep working those
combinations like we worked on.

1:22:48.835 --> 1:22:49.903
Finish this round
right, we'll be

1:22:50.003 --> 1:22:51.104
drinking margaritas in an hour.

1:22:53.773 --> 1:22:54.408
Deep breath.

1:22:54.508 --> 1:22:55.108
Deep breath.

1:22:55.209 --> 1:22:55.675
Calm down.

1:22:55.775 --> 1:22:57.211
Come on.

1:22:57.311 --> 1:22:59.380
You've done this a long...
you've done this a long time.

1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:00.347
You can do this.

1:23:07.288 --> 1:23:07.954
Here we go.

1:23:08.054 --> 1:23:08.855
Round two.

1:23:08.955 --> 1:23:10.790
Reiss is limping off the stall.

1:23:10.890 --> 1:23:13.327
You can just
see by the look on his face

1:23:13.427 --> 1:23:14.928
that he's in agony.

1:23:15.028 --> 1:23:18.332
He's trying his best not to
show it, but Reiss is in pain.

1:23:18.432 --> 1:23:19.732
And Stone knows it.

1:23:19.832 --> 1:23:22.735
Stone is a natural finisher,
and I guarantee you,

1:23:22.835 --> 1:23:25.104
he's going to look to end
this fight in this round.

1:23:25.206 --> 1:23:28.107
Reiss has just
opened a cut over Randy's eye.

1:23:28.209 --> 1:23:30.710
There is no
quit in Reiss Gibbons.

1:23:30.810 --> 1:23:32.613
Pain or no pain,
he's here to fight.

1:23:32.712 --> 1:23:33.314
Come on.

1:23:33.414 --> 1:23:34.215
Move.

1:23:34.315 --> 1:23:34.914
Reiss, come on.

1:23:35.014 --> 1:23:35.382
Move.

1:24:00.173 --> 1:24:01.808
And
Randy lifts Reiss up

1:24:01.908 --> 1:24:03.677
as if he was a bag of feathers.

1:24:03.776 --> 1:24:05.279
Look at the power of Randy!

1:24:11.150 --> 1:24:13.454
He's beating him
into submission.

1:24:13.554 --> 1:24:16.055
This is that famous
mean streak that he was known

1:24:16.155 --> 1:24:17.391
for in the world of wrestling.

1:24:17.491 --> 1:24:18.292
Get out of this, Reiss.

1:24:18.392 --> 1:24:18.992
Reiss, get out of it.

1:24:19.092 --> 1:24:22.630
Reiss, get out of it.

1:24:22.730 --> 1:24:23.631
Get off the cage!

1:24:23.731 --> 1:24:26.966
Get off the cage!

1:24:27.066 --> 1:24:28.034
He's throwing elbows.

1:24:28.134 --> 1:24:29.270
He's throwing punches and knees.

1:24:32.740 --> 1:24:34.974
And Randy has just
headbutted Reiss.

1:24:35.074 --> 1:24:37.010
Oh, that is so disappointed.

1:24:37.110 --> 1:24:38.345
It looks
like he just got

1:24:38.445 --> 1:24:40.381
a little too overzealous
in there with all

1:24:40.481 --> 1:24:41.382
the adrenaline and excitement.

1:24:46.819 --> 1:24:48.955
He will definitely
get a point deducted for that.

1:24:49.055 --> 1:24:50.189
As he should, Jimmy.

1:25:02.436 --> 1:25:05.739
And the doctor has
come in to inspect Reiss's eye.

1:25:05.838 --> 1:25:09.075
It does not look good.

1:25:09.175 --> 1:25:10.810
You can see I'm fighting.

1:25:10.910 --> 1:25:11.679
Straight ahead.

1:25:11.779 --> 1:25:12.746
I'm fighting.

1:25:12.845 --> 1:25:13.414
I can fight.

1:25:13.514 --> 1:25:14.548
OK.

1:25:14.648 --> 1:25:15.249
I don't know if
you can continue.

1:25:15.349 --> 1:25:16.149
I can.

1:25:16.250 --> 1:25:16.617
I don't know...

1:25:16.717 --> 1:25:17.884
I can.

1:25:17.984 --> 1:25:20.354
Your left eye is
nearly completely shut.

1:25:20.454 --> 1:25:21.120
I can see.

1:25:21.221 --> 1:25:22.790
This is not looking good.

1:25:24.525 --> 1:25:27.795
OK, how many fingers?

1:25:27.927 --> 1:25:28.828
Three.

1:25:28.928 --> 1:25:29.829
Yeah, see, you hesitated.

1:25:29.929 --> 1:25:30.597
No, I'm fine.

1:25:30.698 --> 1:25:31.565
Please, please.

1:25:31.665 --> 1:25:33.667
Please, I can continue.

1:25:33.767 --> 1:25:34.668
I really don't know.

1:25:34.768 --> 1:25:35.336
Please.

1:25:35.436 --> 1:25:36.704
Please.

1:25:36.804 --> 1:25:38.272
Yeah, yeah.

1:25:38.372 --> 1:25:40.240
I'm OK.

1:25:40.341 --> 1:25:40.808
Don't stop it.

1:25:40.907 --> 1:25:42.175
I can fight.

1:25:42.276 --> 1:25:43.009
Ref.

1:25:43.109 --> 1:25:44.378
Please, I'm begging you.

1:25:44.478 --> 1:25:45.746
Let me continue.

1:25:45.845 --> 1:25:48.716
I can.

1:25:48.816 --> 1:25:49.383
OK.

1:25:53.152 --> 1:25:55.054
Well, they're
letting him fight.

1:25:55.154 --> 1:25:56.590
This is
a little surprising.

1:25:56.690 --> 1:25:59.493
I know Reiss has a huge heart,
but I've never seen an eye

1:25:59.593 --> 1:26:00.960
that badly swollen.

1:26:01.060 --> 1:26:03.096
Surely his vision is going
to be impaired right now.

1:26:03.196 --> 1:26:04.698
Reiss
looks out of breath.

1:26:04.798 --> 1:26:05.998
I'm sure he'll struggle to see.

1:26:06.099 --> 1:26:07.835
I'm assuming the
doctors and the ref

1:26:07.934 --> 1:26:09.269
will be keeping a
close eye on him

1:26:09.370 --> 1:26:11.538
as he goes to continue
into the round.

1:26:17.977 --> 1:26:19.847
Come on, bitch.

1:26:19.946 --> 1:26:20.814
You motherfucker.

1:26:20.913 --> 1:26:21.815
Cover!

1:26:21.914 --> 1:26:23.217
Cover up!

1:26:23.317 --> 1:26:24.785
And Randy comes
out with heavy hands.

1:26:24.884 --> 1:26:26.286
He wants to end this fight.

1:26:26.387 --> 1:26:28.355
Reiss is sitting
there like a punching bag

1:26:28.455 --> 1:26:30.123
right now.

1:26:30.224 --> 1:26:33.293
Reiss is
holding on for dear life.

1:26:33.394 --> 1:26:34.395
Come on.

1:26:34.495 --> 1:26:35.796
He's got
him against the cage,

1:26:35.895 --> 1:26:37.163
and he's hitting
him over and over.

1:26:37.264 --> 1:26:40.401
I have never seen one
man take such a beating.

1:26:40.501 --> 1:26:42.902
Randy is just
so mean with his strikes.

1:26:43.903 --> 1:26:44.671
And the horn.

1:26:44.772 --> 1:26:46.540
What a fight, Jimmy.

1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:48.575
What a fight.

1:26:48.675 --> 1:26:49.443
I need a finish.

1:26:49.543 --> 1:26:50.711
His groin is ripped.

1:26:50.811 --> 1:26:52.446
His eye is blind.

1:26:52.546 --> 1:26:53.213
Take him down.

1:26:53.313 --> 1:26:53.781
Finish him.

1:26:53.881 --> 1:26:54.882
Count him out.

1:26:54.981 --> 1:26:56.750
It's time to send this guy home.

1:26:56.850 --> 1:26:58.151
I'm gonna take his head off.

1:26:58.252 --> 1:27:00.854
I'm still not free of him.

1:27:00.953 --> 1:27:02.188
We're gonna have
to stop it, bro.

1:27:02.289 --> 1:27:02.890
No.

1:27:02.989 --> 1:27:03.956
No, don't stop it, man.

1:27:04.056 --> 1:27:06.760
I can't put you
out there blind.

1:27:06.860 --> 1:27:09.763
You got nothing left to prove.

1:27:09.863 --> 1:27:10.464
Please.

1:27:22.443 --> 1:27:22.876
Yeah?

1:27:22.975 --> 1:27:23.811
All right.

1:27:23.911 --> 1:27:24.711
All right.

1:27:24.812 --> 1:27:25.945
All right.

1:27:26.045 --> 1:27:27.180
He's the one in the
middle, all right?

1:27:34.954 --> 1:27:36.423
Third round.

1:27:36.523 --> 1:27:40.761
And this is shaping up to be
the fight of the century, easily

1:27:40.861 --> 1:27:44.698
the most exciting fight to have
ever taken place in the Legends

1:27:44.798 --> 1:27:47.166
cage with two of
its biggest stars,

1:27:47.267 --> 1:27:49.770
Reiss Gibbons and Randy Stone.

1:27:49.870 --> 1:27:51.070
I can
guarantee you this.

1:27:51.170 --> 1:27:53.540
No matter how this fight
goes, these two men

1:27:53.640 --> 1:27:54.608
will never be the same.

1:28:19.098 --> 1:28:22.503
Show me something, Reiss.

1:28:22.603 --> 1:28:23.202
Come on.

1:28:23.303 --> 1:28:24.571
You gotta move, Reiss.

1:28:24.671 --> 1:28:25.572
Get out of there.

1:28:27.073 --> 1:28:30.009
Look at the
blood on both their faces.

1:28:30.109 --> 1:28:31.778
Randy is
taunting Reiss in there,

1:28:31.879 --> 1:28:33.480
bouncing around, using feints.

1:28:33.580 --> 1:28:35.983
He knows that Reiss's vision
is bound to be affected.

1:28:45.024 --> 1:28:46.927
You got this, Reiss.

1:28:47.026 --> 1:28:48.428
Send him home.

1:28:48.529 --> 1:28:50.898
Reiss is just
flailing, throwing his arms up

1:28:50.998 --> 1:28:53.065
, just grabbing air.

1:28:53.165 --> 1:28:54.268
This is
just getting messy.

1:28:54.368 --> 1:28:56.837
Reiss looks like
he's out on his feet.

1:28:56.937 --> 1:28:58.839
It's clear he
can't see in there.

1:28:58.939 --> 1:29:00.340
They need to stop this fight.

1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:01.608
If you don't
show me something,

1:29:01.708 --> 1:29:04.611
I gotta throw in the towel.

1:29:04.711 --> 1:29:07.381
Amazing how
Reiss is still hanging on.

1:29:11.251 --> 1:29:13.554
It looks like Reiss
is trying to draw him in.

1:29:13.654 --> 1:29:15.522
Reiss has just
locked in a guillotine choke.

1:29:15.622 --> 1:29:17.123
It
looks tight, Bobby.

1:29:17.224 --> 1:29:18.692
Get him, Reiss.

1:29:18.792 --> 1:29:20.694
Randy's trying to
get out, but it's really tight.

1:29:20.794 --> 1:29:21.628
Come on, Randy.

1:29:21.728 --> 1:29:22.128
Let's go.

1:29:22.229 --> 1:29:22.863
Let's go.

1:29:22.963 --> 1:29:24.264
Work the head.

1:29:24.364 --> 1:29:25.699
Danny Thicket
is shouting instructions.

1:29:25.799 --> 1:29:29.068
He's trying to get out, but
Reiss is locking him in.

1:29:29.168 --> 1:29:31.137
This is the
first time we have ever

1:29:31.238 --> 1:29:33.407
seen Randy Stone in trouble.

1:29:33.507 --> 1:29:36.108
And Randy lifts Reiss
up and above his head.

1:29:36.209 --> 1:29:39.379
Just look at the power!

1:29:39.479 --> 1:29:42.416
What Randy Stone
needs to do is put Reiss down

1:29:42.516 --> 1:29:46.753
and then roll out in order
to get out of this position.

1:29:46.853 --> 1:29:48.288
There you go, Reiss.

1:29:48.388 --> 1:29:49.623
Randy rolls out.

1:29:49.723 --> 1:29:51.058
But Reiss transitions
to a rear naked choke.

1:29:51.157 --> 1:29:51.959
That's it.

1:29:52.059 --> 1:29:53.560
He's got it locked in.

1:29:54.795 --> 1:29:56.930
And Reiss is
squeezing for dear life.

1:30:02.936 --> 1:30:04.838
Come on!

1:30:04.938 --> 1:30:05.806
You gotta tap!

1:30:07.307 --> 1:30:08.775
Squeeze harder.

1:30:17.584 --> 1:30:18.184
Some room!

1:30:18.285 --> 1:30:18.885
Make some room, Randy.

1:30:18.986 --> 1:30:19.653
Come on.

1:30:19.753 --> 1:30:20.687
You can do this!

1:30:20.787 --> 1:30:23.690
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1:30:23.790 --> 1:30:25.659
Don't tap out, Randy.

1:30:32.532 --> 1:30:35.469
Reiss is squeezing,
and Randy Stone is really

1:30:35.569 --> 1:30:37.404
struggling to fight the hands.

1:30:42.342 --> 1:30:43.043
He's going.

1:30:43.142 --> 1:30:43.710
He's out.

1:30:43.810 --> 1:30:44.745
He's out.

1:30:44.845 --> 1:30:45.779
I can't believe it!

1:30:45.879 --> 1:30:47.114
Yes!

1:30:47.214 --> 1:30:49.750
What you have
just seen is greatness,

1:30:49.850 --> 1:30:52.586
and his name is Reiss Gibbons.

1:30:52.686 --> 1:30:55.288
Reiss has come back to
win the heavyweight title!

1:30:55.389 --> 1:30:56.188
Unbelievable, Bobby!

1:30:56.289 --> 1:30:57.224
Of Legends!

1:30:57.324 --> 1:30:58.492
I can't believe it!

1:30:58.592 --> 1:31:00.027
It's never
been done before.

1:31:00.127 --> 1:31:03.162
This is the most amazing fight
in the history of Legends,

1:31:03.263 --> 1:31:06.198
probably in the history
of Mixed Martial Arts.

1:31:06.299 --> 1:31:08.135
Coming back from the
depths of despair,

1:31:08.235 --> 1:31:10.404
from two devastating
losses in a row,

1:31:10.504 --> 1:31:12.939
coming back from retirement,
coming back from the lowest

1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:16.643
point in his career to rise up
and claim the most prestigious

1:31:16.743 --> 1:31:20.113
prize in our sport against
arguably the toughest

1:31:20.213 --> 1:31:22.249
man on this planet.

1:31:22.349 --> 1:31:23.650
It's a fairy tale, Jimmy.

1:31:23.750 --> 1:31:26.019
I cannot believe
what I've just seen.

1:31:26.119 --> 1:31:27.888
You did it!

1:31:27.988 --> 1:31:29.156
I'm so proud of you.

1:31:29.256 --> 1:31:30.457
I'm so proud of you, brother.

1:31:30.557 --> 1:31:31.992
Congratulations,
Reiss Gibbons.

1:31:32.092 --> 1:31:34.628
It's been a pleasure and an
honor to call your fight.

1:31:34.728 --> 1:31:39.499
Ladies and
gentlemen, our referee

1:31:39.599 --> 1:31:43.336
TJ Steele has stopped this
fight in the third round,

1:31:43.437 --> 1:31:48.008
declaring the winner by rear
naked choke, your winner

1:31:48.108 --> 1:31:55.248
and new Heavyweight Legends
Champion of the World, the one,

1:31:55.348 --> 1:32:02.055
the only, Reiss Gibbons!

1:32:14.735 --> 1:32:16.937
I thought you were
going to give up.

1:32:17.037 --> 1:32:18.305
Not this time.

1:32:18.405 --> 1:32:20.340
You're a tough son
of a bitch after all.

1:32:23.310 --> 1:32:28.715
You owe me a
rematch and a drink.

1:32:28.815 --> 1:32:31.785
I made your ass famous.

1:32:31.885 --> 1:32:32.652
All right.

1:32:32.753 --> 1:32:33.453
Let's do it.

1:32:33.553 --> 1:32:35.555
Make it two drinks.

1:32:36.957 --> 1:32:38.191
Three drinks.

1:32:38.291 --> 1:32:41.428
All right.

1:32:41.528 --> 1:32:43.163
Marcus, that's a hell
of a fighter you built.

1:32:43.263 --> 1:32:44.364
No quit in that boy.

1:32:44.464 --> 1:32:45.365
Congratulations.

1:32:45.465 --> 1:32:47.367
Thank you, man.

1:32:47.467 --> 1:32:48.268
Your boy is good.

1:32:48.368 --> 1:32:49.136
Thank you.

1:32:49.237 --> 1:32:51.338
We have work to do.

1:33:29.210 --> 1:33:30.343
Thank you.

1:33:30.443 --> 1:33:32.078
The biggest... the
biggest event ever.

1:33:32.179 --> 1:33:33.247
I mean, the live
gate was ridiculous.

1:33:33.346 --> 1:33:34.581
Over 30,000 people.

1:33:34.681 --> 1:33:36.284
We had to turn people away.

1:33:36.383 --> 1:33:38.084
Pay-per-view is out of this...

1:33:38.185 --> 1:33:39.253
I mean, it's off the charts.

1:33:39.352 --> 1:33:40.520
It's off the charts.

1:33:40.620 --> 1:33:41.488
I mean, this was the
most exciting fight

1:33:41.588 --> 1:33:42.455
I've ever seen in my life.

1:33:42.556 --> 1:33:43.957
The fans were going crazy.

1:33:44.057 --> 1:33:46.126
I mean, it didn't look so
good for Reiss for a while,

1:33:46.227 --> 1:33:48.161
but, I mean, you
gotta hand it to him.

1:33:48.262 --> 1:33:49.362
He's a champ.

1:33:49.462 --> 1:33:52.666
That guy is a
champ, coming back.

1:33:52.766 --> 1:33:54.100
Oh, the eye is going to be fine.

1:33:54.201 --> 1:33:55.402
I mean, yeah, it's bad.

1:33:55.502 --> 1:33:56.304
Did you see the fight?

1:33:56.403 --> 1:33:57.238
The fight was insane.

1:33:57.337 --> 1:33:59.472
But you know, Reiss...

1:33:59.573 --> 1:34:02.509
I have to say, Reiss bounces
back like nobody you've

1:34:02.609 --> 1:34:04.578
ever seen in this business.

1:34:04.678 --> 1:34:05.946
I mean, he'll probably
end up getting,

1:34:06.046 --> 1:34:09.349
you know, eye patch
sponsors from this thing.

1:34:09.449 --> 1:34:10.450
That's all we know.

1:34:10.550 --> 1:34:12.085
Don't worry about Reiss.

1:34:12.185 --> 1:34:13.854
He's a six-time
champ now, right?

1:34:13.954 --> 1:34:15.155
I mean, he's our guy.

1:34:15.256 --> 1:34:17.457
We started Legends with him.

1:34:17.557 --> 1:34:19.192
I'm so proud of him.

1:34:19.293 --> 1:34:20.594
I was nervous.

1:34:20.694 --> 1:34:23.997
I'll be honest, I was
nervous for a little bit.

1:34:24.097 --> 1:34:25.299
It wasn't looking good.

1:34:25.398 --> 1:34:27.400
But, you know, Reiss
has got so much heart.

1:34:27.500 --> 1:34:30.537
And he's a beautiful spirit.

1:34:30.637 --> 1:34:32.472
He's the sort of fighter...
he loves to fight,

1:34:32.572 --> 1:34:34.007
but of all a
sudden, you know, he

1:34:34.107 --> 1:34:36.076
could turn around and go become
a professor or something.

1:34:36.176 --> 1:34:37.077
I don't know.

1:34:37.177 --> 1:34:39.045
He could do something else.

1:34:39.145 --> 1:34:41.047
I mean, the one who's
off the chart is Randy.

1:34:41.147 --> 1:34:42.616
I mean, that guy...

1:34:42.716 --> 1:34:44.451
I mean, that guy is
in an animal, right?

1:34:44.551 --> 1:34:45.886
I mean, he could do no wrong.

1:34:45.986 --> 1:34:49.122
You have no idea the
sponsors this guy is getting.

1:34:49.223 --> 1:34:50.557
I mean, we're
talking book deals.

1:34:50.657 --> 1:34:51.758
We're talking restaurant deals.

1:34:51.858 --> 1:34:53.526
We're talking
speaking engagements.

1:34:53.627 --> 1:34:55.428
I mean, he's now the star...

1:34:55.528 --> 1:34:56.596
we just found out tonight.

1:34:56.696 --> 1:34:57.831
Am I allowed to say?

1:34:57.931 --> 1:34:58.531
All right.

1:34:58.632 --> 1:34:59.733
I'm allowed to say this.

1:34:59.833 --> 1:35:01.501
He's gonna be the
new Ax Man, right?

1:35:01.601 --> 1:35:04.238
From the guys who brought
you the "Chainsaw" trilogy,

1:35:04.338 --> 1:35:06.806
he's the new Ax Man coming out.

1:35:06.907 --> 1:35:07.941
Amazing.

1:35:08.041 --> 1:35:11.177
He's opening up... he
just got this gig today.

1:35:11.279 --> 1:35:12.380
I mean, it doesn't matter.

1:35:12.479 --> 1:35:14.114
It doesn't matter
if this guy loses.

1:35:14.215 --> 1:35:17.183
He's now going to
be the spokesman

1:35:17.285 --> 1:35:18.919
of the Cult of Raw Aggression.

1:35:19.019 --> 1:35:20.587
I don't know if
you've heard about it.

1:35:20.687 --> 1:35:23.357
It's this big... you know,
big motivational speaker.

1:35:23.456 --> 1:35:24.958
And now we're going to tie it...

1:35:25.058 --> 1:35:28.628
Legends, we're going to tie this
into his new restaurant, Raw.

1:35:28.728 --> 1:35:30.630
You know, I think before
when he was a pro wrestler,

1:35:30.730 --> 1:35:35.769
he had that restaurant, Meat,
when he was a huge meat eater,

1:35:35.869 --> 1:35:39.005
and it was raw meat,
any kind of meat.

1:35:39.105 --> 1:35:40.308
But now I don't know.

1:35:40.408 --> 1:35:43.576
He's got this new
whole thing going on.

1:35:43.677 --> 1:35:45.313
He's gone vegan,
and that's where

1:35:45.413 --> 1:35:46.613
he says a lot of
his stuff's coming...

1:35:46.713 --> 1:35:50.917
so now Raw is featuring,
like, vegan sausages

1:35:51.017 --> 1:35:51.651
and anything raw.

1:35:51.751 --> 1:35:53.053
And he gets his power.

1:35:53.153 --> 1:35:54.654
So we're going to tie that
in... the Raw Aggression

1:35:54.754 --> 1:35:56.656
into the Raw restaurants,
the Legends thing.

1:35:56.756 --> 1:35:57.757
We're packaging it.

1:35:57.857 --> 1:35:59.092
You can get it in the stores.

1:35:59.192 --> 1:36:00.460
You can get it anywhere.

1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:01.761
It's pretty awesome.

1:36:01.861 --> 1:36:03.997
And what it
specializes in beets...

1:36:04.097 --> 1:36:06.334
like, beet juice,
so you could eat it,

1:36:06.434 --> 1:36:07.500
and it looks like blood.

1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:09.869
And Randy sells
the shit out of it.

1:36:09.970 --> 1:36:11.071
Oh, man.

1:36:11.171 --> 1:36:14.674
He's got everything...
diapers, diaper sponsors.

1:36:14.774 --> 1:36:16.543
You know, you can
never be too strong.

1:36:16.643 --> 1:36:17.777
People love this guy.

1:36:17.877 --> 1:36:18.945
It doesn't matter
if he wins or loses.

1:36:19.045 --> 1:36:19.512
He's an animal.

1:36:19.612 --> 1:36:20.247
They love him.

1:36:20.348 --> 1:36:21.282
Oh, yeah.

1:36:21.382 --> 1:36:24.017
I mean, of all people, Randy...

1:36:24.117 --> 1:36:24.985
I mean, listen.

1:36:25.085 --> 1:36:28.389
He just got this
huge book deal also.

1:36:28.488 --> 1:36:30.291
It's going to be a big thing.

1:36:30.391 --> 1:36:31.758
It's those motivational things.

1:36:31.858 --> 1:36:34.362
He's really big on that
chain, but he's wrestling

1:36:34.462 --> 1:36:35.729
with your inner aggro.

1:36:35.829 --> 1:36:37.664
He talks, and people
write it down.

1:36:37.764 --> 1:36:38.698
He's got pictures.

1:36:38.798 --> 1:36:40.600
I mean, he's a lot different.

1:36:40.700 --> 1:36:43.304
He's kind of a
sensitive guy, really.

1:36:43.404 --> 1:36:44.704
I mean, you would
never believe it,

1:36:44.804 --> 1:36:48.041
but I think the whole raw
thing has shifted him.

1:36:49.943 --> 1:36:56.384
And you stand outside
the frame, outside the frame.

1:36:56.484 --> 1:36:59.753
They say this life
is a perfect storm.

1:36:59.853 --> 1:37:02.522
So just keep cool,
always keep it calm.

1:37:25.645 --> 1:37:27.147
Yeah.

1:37:27.248 --> 1:37:30.518
It's your boy,.

1:37:30.617 --> 1:37:32.552
Yeah.

1:37:32.652 --> 1:37:37.525
I been working so hard,
trying to find my place,

1:37:37.624 --> 1:37:43.830
trying to spread my
wings, waiting for my day.

1:37:43.930 --> 1:37:48.802
I pray to god every day
for the strength I crave.

1:37:48.902 --> 1:37:52.172
Then it's back to the grind
in the lab like the docks.

1:37:52.273 --> 1:37:55.175
And the struggle's still going,
so the hustle won't stop.

1:37:55.276 --> 1:37:56.643
Let's go.

1:37:56.743 --> 1:37:59.579
Back then, he was just a
shorty, pocket full of dreams,

1:37:59.679 --> 1:38:00.046
and the...
