00:12.374 --> 00:15.373
Tonight, we get very cold and wet...

00:15.374 --> 00:18.253
I re-enact the Battle of Britain...

00:18.254 --> 00:19.893
Oh, nuts.

00:19.894 --> 00:23.094
And there's a Blur
in a reasonably-priced car.

00:31.454 --> 00:34.334
Hello. Thank you so much,
everybody. Thank you.

00:35.814 --> 00:39.893
We will begin with track days.
The idea behind them is simple.

00:39.894 --> 00:43.413
During the week, when there is no
actual motor racing going on,

00:43.414 --> 00:46.293
the owners of race circuits allow
people to rock up

00:46.294 --> 00:49.613
and spend the day
whizzing around in their own cars.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.613
This is now so popular,

00:51.614 --> 00:55.893
you can even buy cars specifically
designed with track days in mind.

00:55.894 --> 01:00.213
We decided to go down to the
Simply Sausages Donnington race track

01:00.214 --> 01:02.774
to sort out which one is best.

01:12.494 --> 01:18.374
This is the original track-day car
and, in my opinion, still the best.

01:27.894 --> 01:32.133
It's... the Caterham 7.
But it is no ordinary Caterham 7.

01:32.134 --> 01:36.733
This is the R500 Superlight.
It is less heavy.

01:36.734 --> 01:39.973
It has no frills, adornments,
garnish, apart from a few stripes.

01:39.974 --> 01:42.333
It is simple, pure.

01:42.334 --> 01:46.213
It is an unadulterated driving
experience and I absolutely love it.

01:46.214 --> 01:48.453
But - and this is a weird thing...

01:48.454 --> 01:52.414
Jeremy Clarkson believes he has come
up with something better.

01:55.494 --> 01:58.813
Woo-hoo!

01:58.814 --> 02:03.093
Yes, I have.
This is the KTM X-bow.

02:03.094 --> 02:08.094
Part insect,
part terrain-following missile.

02:13.094 --> 02:14.493
Wait a minute. What?

02:14.494 --> 02:17.973
I thought you were bringing that new
thing they were making in Cheshire.

02:17.974 --> 02:20.413
What, the BAC Mono?

02:20.414 --> 02:24.293
Yes. It broke down. Where did
it break down? In the factory.

02:24.294 --> 02:26.693
It broke down while
they were still building it?

02:26.694 --> 02:28.853
It really did.

02:28.854 --> 02:31.093
This is my second choice

02:31.094 --> 02:34.093
and, despite that, it is still
better than yours.

02:34.094 --> 02:37.333
Is it? Yes. Why is that then?

02:37.334 --> 02:40.493
Because yours is from the 1950s
and this is from this morning.

02:40.494 --> 02:46.253
Carbon-fibre panels, mid-engined,
pushrod actuated
double wishbone suspension.

02:46.254 --> 02:47.494
How much is it?

02:47.495 --> 02:52.253
49,000. You see, £41,000
so it is cheaper. And it is better.

02:52.254 --> 02:56.933
This was fine in 1961. It is
not the same car any more.

02:56.934 --> 02:59.413
It has a better engine,
suspension, materials,

02:59.414 --> 03:01.533
it has been made slightly wider.

03:01.534 --> 03:03.373
It has modern instruments.

03:03.374 --> 03:06.253
A sequential shift.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.813
'At this point,
we were joined by our colleague.'

03:08.814 --> 03:13.014
What in the name
of all that's holy...?!

03:15.574 --> 03:21.453
You see, if you want a car built
purely for fun, you want this.

03:21.454 --> 03:25.613
It is made largely from aluminium
which is mixed with wood,

03:25.614 --> 03:28.493
but that is the way Morgan
build their cards.

03:28.494 --> 03:32.133
Why does it have RAF roundels on it?

03:32.134 --> 03:34.893
It has been styled
to look like an aeroplane.

03:34.894 --> 03:38.173
It hasn't got wings!
It has aeroplane-style gauges.

03:38.174 --> 03:43.293
Why is the engine not in the car?
Because it is an air-cooled V twin.

03:43.294 --> 03:45.973
It needs to be outside
because that is where the air is.

03:45.974 --> 03:48.573
What's in there?
Oil tank. And the battery.

03:48.574 --> 03:52.493
I think, move to the back, Hammond.
I have another question.

03:52.494 --> 03:55.973
The question I am going to ask is
it doesn't have any back wheels.

03:55.974 --> 03:58.853
It has one in the middle, there.

03:58.854 --> 04:01.693
So it is a tricycle?
It is a three wheeler.

04:01.694 --> 04:05.653
It is reminiscent of the original
Morgan three wheeler.

04:05.654 --> 04:10.653
Ask me what it weighs.
What does it weigh? 495 kilos.

04:10.654 --> 04:12.813
Less than 500 kilos.
It is only half a car.

04:12.814 --> 04:16.892
If I sawed my leg off, I would weigh
much less than I do now.

04:16.894 --> 04:18.933
I would keep falling over.

04:18.934 --> 04:21.853
You could pick this up
and put it in your pocket.

04:21.853 --> 04:23.893
It looks like a coal scuttle.

04:23.894 --> 04:28.613
I have got to ask, how much?
With taxes and things? Yes. £30,000.

04:28.614 --> 04:33.253
£30,000?!
It would be 40 if it had four wheels.

04:33.254 --> 04:36.213
Did you say it is made from wood?

04:36.214 --> 04:39.333
That's how Morgan build cars.
Traditional.

04:39.334 --> 04:43.013
I reckon if you went to Morgan and
said would you like some diphtheria?

04:43.014 --> 04:45.053
They'd say, "Yes,"
cos that's traditional.

04:45.054 --> 04:47.853
Wood is light and flexible
and endlessly renewable

04:47.854 --> 04:50.213
and an excellent material
to build cars from.

04:50.214 --> 04:52.493
People don't do it
cos you need craftsmen.

04:52.494 --> 04:55.733
You cannot have some oik pressing
a button and stamping them out.

04:55.734 --> 04:58.214
The Nissan GTR would be worse
if it was made of wood.

04:58.215 --> 05:03.653
The early aeroplanes were made
from wood but the Boeing 747 isn't.
There's no wood in it.

05:03.654 --> 05:10.373
Eventually, the producers told us
to stop arguing about wood
and get on with the first challenge.

05:10.374 --> 05:15.453
A simple straight-line race
from nought to 100 then back
to nought again.

05:15.454 --> 05:18.973
Sadly, this led to another dispute.

05:18.974 --> 05:26.653
What do you mean, "a Le Mans start"?
On go, we run to our cars, jump in,
start them and drive off.

05:26.654 --> 05:32.013
Running? It is not a school sports
day. Will you have an egg and spoon?

05:32.014 --> 05:37.133
It is two against one. Be ready.
Three, two, one, go.

05:37.134 --> 05:40.133
This is stupid.

05:40.134 --> 05:43.494
We could have been finished by now.

05:46.254 --> 05:48.693
Hammond has already begun.

05:48.694 --> 05:53.613
The 1.9 litre V twin!

05:53.614 --> 05:58.973
'Sadly, my elderly colleagues were
struggling to get going.'

05:58.974 --> 06:01.653
Very complicated starting procedure.

06:01.654 --> 06:02.733
Mode.

06:02.734 --> 06:05.293
'Eventually,
James was belted in place,

06:05.294 --> 06:08.294
'a bit too tightly as it turned out.'

06:09.414 --> 06:13.373
Oh, bloody hell!

06:13.374 --> 06:15.013
Why don't you start?

06:15.014 --> 06:17.214
Stop saying ready to race!

06:19.574 --> 06:24.173
Out of pity for their incompetence,
I decided to abort.

06:24.174 --> 06:27.333
Can I make a suggestion? What?
We are here to test the cars.

06:27.334 --> 06:29.693
We're not here to find out who
is the fattest.

06:29.694 --> 06:32.573
Or which has the most
complicated starting procedure.

06:32.574 --> 06:34.493
Or whose belts are badly adjusted.

06:34.494 --> 06:38.133
Let's do it normally.
But with the Le Mans start, I won.

06:38.134 --> 06:41.053
Yes, but that is just
because you are the fittest.

06:41.054 --> 06:44.334
I won the Le Mans start.
Let's do an old man's version.

06:45.454 --> 06:49.654
Do I have to
have my feet on the break? Yes!

06:55.254 --> 06:59.533
I should be all right here. I have
the best power-to-weight ratio.
I have the fastest car.

06:59.534 --> 07:03.494
Sequential gearbox,
good view ahead.

07:06.094 --> 07:08.974
And three, two, one...

07:12.414 --> 07:15.053
Great start into second.

07:15.054 --> 07:17.814
Boy, did they get away!

07:19.054 --> 07:21.653
100.

07:21.654 --> 07:24.894
Jeremy has stopped on the way.
I will have to go past.

07:26.094 --> 07:30.093
I am not sure that is miles an hour.
That might be fuel pressure.

07:30.094 --> 07:35.574
It was, so we went back to
the start line to try again.

07:38.574 --> 07:40.094
Three, two...

07:41.534 --> 07:43.693
No!

07:43.694 --> 07:45.653
James went on two.

07:45.654 --> 07:47.733
This is ridiculous.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.453
So we lined up
for attempt number four.

07:50.454 --> 07:57.173
How hard can it be for three grown
men to see which is the fastest from
nought to 100 then back again?

07:57.174 --> 08:00.974
Three, two, one.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.694
God!

08:09.414 --> 08:11.213
Why has that happened?

08:11.214 --> 08:14.134
Is that 100 already?!

08:15.334 --> 08:16.814
100.

08:20.854 --> 08:23.254
Why did he break so soon?

08:25.134 --> 08:26.853
Ow!

08:26.854 --> 08:30.693
As it turned out, James'
celebrations were premature.

08:30.694 --> 08:34.253
He had been reading his speedometer
in kilometres an hour.

08:34.254 --> 08:35.933
Oh, cock!

08:35.933 --> 08:38.013
Still, it could be worse.

08:38.014 --> 08:43.573
95. Now there is a corner
and going to have to do... Oh!

08:45.494 --> 08:47.974
70, 80, oh, a corner.

08:49.494 --> 08:50.973
This is impossible.

08:50.974 --> 08:54.813
James decided that rather than
do the test again,

08:54.814 --> 08:59.253
he would show his car
was the fastest using maths.

08:59.254 --> 09:02.293
I have a sheet of all the facts.

09:02.294 --> 09:07.374
Yours weighs almost twice
as much as mine. Yes. Hang on.

09:09.974 --> 09:12.013
He is still not doing 100.

09:12.014 --> 09:14.494
75, 80, 85. Aah!

09:17.814 --> 09:19.813
Now the speedo has died.

09:19.814 --> 09:22.933
It has a better power-to-weight
ratio than the Bugatti Veyron.

09:22.934 --> 09:24.893
517 horsepower per ton.

09:24.894 --> 09:28.573
I was forced to agree
with James' conclusions.

09:28.574 --> 09:30.613
So I came up with a new test.

09:30.614 --> 09:33.573
Cornering is everything and with
pushrod-actuated suspension,

09:33.574 --> 09:36.613
I will go round corners
faster than you can.

09:36.614 --> 09:39.053
And there is no arguing with that.

09:39.054 --> 09:45.013
There is, actually, because I
have had these photographs printed
and they are all

09:45.014 --> 09:48.733
photos of X-bows just after
they have done some cornering.

09:48.734 --> 09:52.494
That one is parked in a tree. It is
hanging from a crane near a tree.

09:53.974 --> 09:56.373
That is just outside a bend there.

09:56.374 --> 09:58.373
A ditch near a bend.

09:58.374 --> 10:01.853
Near a corner. Look at that.

10:01.854 --> 10:03.573
Even though there was evidence

10:03.574 --> 10:06.493
to suggest I would be killed
by a cornering test...

10:06.494 --> 10:12.293
Richard would not fare much better
either - the producer said

10:12.294 --> 10:16.613
we should see which car would be
fastest through the old hairpin.

10:16.614 --> 10:19.613
Because we were having
such trouble reading our speedos,

10:19.614 --> 10:22.374
they set up a police style
radar trap.

10:25.854 --> 10:28.293
Why is everything breaking today?
I do not know.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.293
Why doesn't that happened to
the police? It doesn't.

10:31.294 --> 10:33.573
The NHS computer would not work.

10:33.574 --> 10:36.293
There is a man who can
print out a receipt for us.

10:36.294 --> 10:38.613
He will tell us the cornering speed.

10:38.614 --> 10:44.614
With the speed equipment working,
I set off to disprove James'
photographic evidence.

10:45.734 --> 10:49.013
It is not just the pushrod-actuated
suspension,

10:49.014 --> 10:52.453
it's the tyres that will put me
in good stead.

10:52.454 --> 10:54.293
Very sticky tyres.

10:54.294 --> 10:57.454
I doubt he has a clue what
pushrod suspension is. No idea.

11:01.014 --> 11:07.373
And the time is? 69.419 miles an
hour. Is that good? I have no idea.

11:07.374 --> 11:09.813
Then it was James' turn.

11:09.814 --> 11:12.853
Listen to that. He has gone right
up nearly to the red light.

11:12.854 --> 11:15.534
Where does it go?
Yes, down here. Here we go.

11:17.174 --> 11:18.613
He went the right way.

11:18.614 --> 11:20.413
He was going the right way

11:20.414 --> 11:23.173
but did you see how far
he was from the apex?

11:23.174 --> 11:24.893
How fast was he? 59.

11:24.894 --> 11:27.373
What do we call him?
What's his nickname?

11:27.374 --> 11:30.333
Captain Quick.

11:30.334 --> 11:31.373
It isn't that.

11:31.374 --> 11:35.814
Finally, Richard took a brave pill
and stepped into the tricycle.

11:37.014 --> 11:38.214
I am so screwed here.

11:38.215 --> 11:43.174
The wheels! Those are not wide tyres.

11:45.174 --> 11:47.574
What do they do, the pushrods?

11:49.414 --> 11:52.373
Many things.
They must do something specific.

11:52.374 --> 11:55.493
They don't make the engine go.
What do they do in the suspension?

11:55.494 --> 11:56.774
Everything better.

11:56.775 --> 12:00.013
Suspension. Yes, yes.

12:00.014 --> 12:02.293
I have some.
Some there and some there.

12:02.294 --> 12:03.334
And a bit back there.

12:03.335 --> 12:06.013
More than that.

12:06.014 --> 12:09.973
They're better. Why?
They just are. Yes, but why?

12:09.974 --> 12:11.293
Many reasons.

12:11.294 --> 12:13.293
Come on, my little
three-wheeled friend.

12:13.294 --> 12:16.253
Here he comes. Doff your hats.

12:16.254 --> 12:18.813
Roll out the barrel.

12:18.814 --> 12:21.853
♪ Any old iron, any old iron
Any, any, any old iron... ♪

12:21.854 --> 12:27.053
I am going to give it the full
Stirling Moss. Ya-a-ah!

12:27.054 --> 12:30.173
Did you see him
clinging on with his elbow?

12:30.174 --> 12:32.054
You could see the sinews
in his arm.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.573
The sound is from the 1930s.

12:33.574 --> 12:36.333
Did the picture go black
and white as he went past?

12:36.334 --> 12:37.894
Wow!

12:40.174 --> 12:44.813
Hammond, James' fastest time
was 59.8. Your fastest time,

12:44.814 --> 12:47.253
60.4.

12:47.254 --> 12:50.973
Ha-ha! In the Morgan, well done.

12:50.974 --> 12:54.933
James and I had been greatly looking
forward to Richard's car

12:54.934 --> 12:57.093
falling over in the
cornering challenge.

12:57.094 --> 13:01.653
Since it hadn't, we quickly
came up with another idea.

13:01.654 --> 13:06.293
Doughnuts. We're going to see which
one of us can do the best doughnuts.

13:06.294 --> 13:07.454
It was James' idea.

13:07.455 --> 13:10.813
Are you trying to think of challenges
that you think my car can't do?

13:10.814 --> 13:12.093
Yes. No.

13:12.094 --> 13:16.093
The trouble is I didn't think
the X-bow would be much good either.

13:16.094 --> 13:21.014
I am not sure, with these tyres,
which are so sticky, that this
is going to work.

13:29.414 --> 13:32.813
It's like driving on superglue.

13:32.814 --> 13:37.694
You do it.
So he did and he was rather good.

13:42.294 --> 13:46.333
That is a doughnut.
James May doing a doughnut.

13:46.334 --> 13:48.853
That is like watching a vicar
play poker.

13:48.854 --> 13:49.894
Strip poker.

13:51.694 --> 13:55.053
Then came the moment we'd all
been waiting for.

13:55.054 --> 13:56.373
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:56.374 --> 14:01.213
sit back now and get ready
to laugh your ears off.

14:01.214 --> 14:02.494
As Hammond does a dough.

14:02.495 --> 14:05.574
It only has one wheel
so he can't do a full doughnut.

14:20.534 --> 14:21.934
How is that possible?

14:25.894 --> 14:27.813
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

14:27.814 --> 14:30.213
You didn't expect that, did you?

14:30.214 --> 14:33.333
It was a stupid test.

14:33.334 --> 14:34.374
Because I won.

14:38.134 --> 14:41.093
At this point,
we decided to abandon the tests

14:41.094 --> 14:45.053
and do what people
do on track days drive.

14:45.054 --> 14:50.173
This design may be
as old as Jeremy,

14:50.174 --> 14:53.133
but if you are interested in
the sensation of driving a car

14:53.134 --> 14:57.094
and everything that involves,
then you will love this.

14:58.254 --> 15:00.853
I know Jeremy's
blathering on about pushrods,

15:00.854 --> 15:04.173
but this has quite sophisticated
suspension as well.

15:04.174 --> 15:05.693
Fully adjustable,

15:05.694 --> 15:09.653
and let's not forget that Caterham
now is an F1 team.

15:09.654 --> 15:13.453
'In fact, I had only one complaint
about my car.'

15:13.454 --> 15:16.014
Put a windscreen on it!

15:18.454 --> 15:20.413
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

15:20.414 --> 15:22.773
I was expecting it to be
quite sudden

15:22.774 --> 15:24.854
when you get to the limit,
but it isn't!

15:26.614 --> 15:28.213
It's remarkably forgiving.

15:28.214 --> 15:30.853
But if I've got one criticism
of this car,

15:30.854 --> 15:34.413
I'd say it's a bit... safe,
a bit soft.

15:34.414 --> 15:39.934
It's almost like they've edited it
to make it easy for everybody.

15:41.894 --> 15:45.253
I'm not entirely sure that this is,
strictly speaking,

15:45.254 --> 15:49.214
a track-day car as such.
But God, it's fun!

15:50.174 --> 15:53.573
I'm having more fun than I remember
having in a long time, actually.

15:53.574 --> 15:58.614
0-60 in 4.5 seconds,
top speed 115mph.

16:00.734 --> 16:03.093
Two big pistons firing away.

16:03.094 --> 16:05.654
Ha-ha-ha!

16:12.774 --> 16:17.173
On a track day, of course,
there's always one absolute rule.

16:17.174 --> 16:18.854
No racing.

16:19.694 --> 16:21.253
Must get past James!

16:21.254 --> 16:23.014
Must overtake.

16:24.134 --> 16:26.253
Two-litre engine in that Caterham

16:26.254 --> 16:30.693
is the same basic unit you find
in a Ford Galaxy people carrier,

16:30.694 --> 16:34.693
whereas the two-litre turbo
in this is from a Golf GTI.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.413
It's just better.

16:37.414 --> 16:40.653
Right, now here's the problem.

16:40.654 --> 16:43.213
James has no spatial awareness
at all,

16:43.214 --> 16:46.533
so there's no way of knowing
what he's going to do next.

16:46.534 --> 16:48.094
What happens next?

16:56.654 --> 16:58.613
Oh, ha-ha!

16:58.614 --> 17:01.014
I might have gone off a bit there.

17:04.814 --> 17:09.653
♪ Jeremy's in the gravel
Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha... ♪

17:09.654 --> 17:11.733
Oh, ho-ho-ho!

17:11.733 --> 17:15.053
It is incredible to think
that today, you aren't allowed to

17:15.054 --> 17:18.532
smack a child or ask your dogs to
get rid of the rats in the shed,

17:18.534 --> 17:22.054
and yet you CAN do this!

17:24.374 --> 17:25.973
100mph, probably.

17:25.973 --> 17:29.773
Just brilliant - you and your mates
just belting round

17:29.774 --> 17:32.254
indulging your passion for cars.

17:33.694 --> 17:37.974
'And better still, it costs less
than a speeding ticket.'

17:46.854 --> 17:50.893
Anyway! How much fun was that?

17:50.894 --> 17:52.373
Loads!

17:52.374 --> 17:56.653
It was brilliant! You pay, what, 100
quid, and you get a day doing 100mph.

17:56.654 --> 18:00.693
Well, YOU don't.
Look, as a fun car, mine was best.

18:00.694 --> 18:02.693
Hang on a minute, Hammond.

18:02.694 --> 18:06.533
The idea was to find out which was
the best track-day car, yeah?

18:06.534 --> 18:08.893
And that was mine.
He's right, it was.

18:08.894 --> 18:11.893
What? No, it was. Mine...
I mean, I know it has

18:11.894 --> 18:15.813
pushrod activated suspension, which
moves the weight in-board and...

18:15.814 --> 18:18.014
What's the other thing it does?

18:19.134 --> 18:22.333
By adjusting...
No, I'm not interested.

18:22.334 --> 18:25.173
Er, despite all of that,
it feels a bit heavy

18:25.174 --> 18:27.453
and a bit predictable
and a bit boring.

18:27.454 --> 18:30.573
This is where the Morgan shines.
It is exciting and different

18:30.574 --> 18:32.693
and it vibrates as you drive it.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.454
Mm-hmm. Let me interrupt, if I may.

18:34.455 --> 18:36.813
Who here would like to see The Stig

18:36.814 --> 18:40.614
attempting to get that Morgan
round our track?

18:42.574 --> 18:43.854
Play the tape.

18:45.414 --> 18:49.773
And he's off. The single rear wheel
fighting for grip.

18:49.774 --> 18:54.053
Never seen anything as ridiculous as
that in my whole life. Looks great.

18:54.054 --> 18:57.653
Where's he going there?!
Oh, he nearly lost it!

18:57.654 --> 19:00.733
But he's held it together.
Look at that!

19:00.734 --> 19:04.013
Yes, he's made it round
the first corner.

19:04.014 --> 19:07.493
There he is, looking terrified.
As he comes into Chicago.

19:07.494 --> 19:12.453
Oh, he's drifting it! He is actually
drifting it, you're right.

19:12.454 --> 19:15.453
Be interesting to see what happens
in Hammerhead. Here we are.

19:15.454 --> 19:18.653
That little 1.9-litre twin-cylinder
engine's got so much torque,

19:18.654 --> 19:22.573
they had to invent and fit something
called a radial deflection damper

19:22.574 --> 19:25.173
so it didn't lunch
the Mazda MX5 gearbox. Really.

19:25.174 --> 19:30.253
Yes. OK, well he must be
up to at least 45mph now.

19:30.254 --> 19:34.253
No, he's changing down for
the Follow-through, to maybe 40.

19:34.254 --> 19:35.734
Yeah, but he's having fun!

19:35.735 --> 19:38.933
Missing the dent there,
so he doesn't break his spine,

19:38.934 --> 19:40.853
if indeed he's got a spine.

19:40.854 --> 19:42.373
Whoa!

19:42.374 --> 19:45.973
Struggling to... He's missed
the apex there quite badly.

19:45.974 --> 19:49.173
Only Gambon to go - can he make it
round there without incident?

19:49.174 --> 19:51.293
Yes... no, wait! He's lost it!

19:51.294 --> 19:54.294
And across the line backwards!

19:59.974 --> 20:02.493
I have the times.

20:02.494 --> 20:06.253
Now, the Caterham, as we know,
cos it's been around before,

20:06.254 --> 20:08.213
did a 1:17.9.

20:08.214 --> 20:12.573
The X-bow we ran this morning,
1:27 dead.

20:12.574 --> 20:14.813
And the Morgan...

20:14.814 --> 20:16.813
1:40...

20:16.814 --> 20:20.493
point 4,
which is the same as one year.

20:20.494 --> 20:21.893
It's pathetic.

20:21.894 --> 20:25.173
That is the fastest three-wheeler
we've ever had round our track.

20:25.174 --> 20:28.493
The only other three-wheeler
we ever had was the Reliant Robin,

20:28.494 --> 20:32.493
and he fell over in that in the
first corner. And that was faster.

20:32.494 --> 20:36.493
So there we are. The Morgan is
faster than a Reliant Robin.

20:36.494 --> 20:39.253
Anyway, we will be picking that up
again later on,

20:39.254 --> 20:42.333
so if you want to see us endure
the most dreadful misery,

20:42.334 --> 20:45.613
please stick with us.
But now, it's the news.

20:45.614 --> 20:48.333
Right, listen.
I have got a photograph of

20:48.334 --> 20:51.333
the replacement for the Ferrari 599,
here it is.

20:51.334 --> 20:55.173
It's called the F12 Berlinetta.

20:55.174 --> 20:56.613
It's smaller than a 599,

20:56.614 --> 20:59.893
which is a good thing, it's also
lighter and more powerful.

20:59.894 --> 21:05.173
It's got a 730-horsepower V12.

21:05.174 --> 21:09.013
Wow. 730! V12? V12!

21:09.014 --> 21:12.133
Are you not the same Mr So-Called
Jeremy Clarkson

21:12.134 --> 21:14.213
who on this programme
but a month ago,

21:14.214 --> 21:16.733
driving the Lamborghini Aventador,

21:16.734 --> 21:19.134
said, "This is the last
of the V12s. From now on,

21:19.135 --> 21:23.093
"all engines will have turbos
on them." You did say that.
I did say that.

21:23.094 --> 21:25.253
And now how do you feel?
Foolish. I did say.

21:25.254 --> 21:28.853
You were really unequivocal on that.
I was unequivocal, but I was wrong.

21:28.854 --> 21:33.413
Yes. For the first time since 1974.

21:33.414 --> 21:36.293
Now. Citroen has sent us
a picture of this.

21:36.294 --> 21:38.573
Now this is a sporty version
of the DS4,

21:38.574 --> 21:41.133
and I think it looks rather good.

21:41.134 --> 21:45.533
256 horsepower
from its 1.6-litre turbo engine.

21:45.534 --> 21:48.093
Same engine as you get in
a Mini Cooper. It's not bad.

21:48.094 --> 21:51.133
I think that looks rather good.
I prefer this, though.

21:51.134 --> 21:54.373
This is the, er, Renault Megane 265,
which has got...

21:54.374 --> 21:57.973
265 - let me guess how many
horsepower that's got. Have a go.

21:57.974 --> 22:00.173
Is it 312? No. Is it 8? No.

22:00.174 --> 22:02.573
What is it? 265. Is it?! Yeah.

22:02.574 --> 22:05.773
It's quite a powerful car,
and it's got a clever diff,

22:05.774 --> 22:08.773
it has a cut chassis, it's got,
you know, stiffened springs,

22:08.774 --> 22:10.333
all that sort of thing.

22:10.334 --> 22:12.813
It's £26,000,
which is sort of Golf GTI money.

22:12.814 --> 22:17.373
I think that looks brilliant.
Except for the red brake callipers.

22:17.374 --> 22:20.133
What's wrong with
red brake callipers?

22:20.134 --> 22:22.614
How empty and shallow
and pointless and meaningless

22:22.615 --> 22:27.173
must your life be for you to say,
"Yes. I'd like red brake callipers"?

22:27.174 --> 22:31.493
I've got red brake callipers on my
Fiat 500 TwinAir. They look cute!

22:31.494 --> 22:34.093
They look great!
Why have you got them?

22:34.094 --> 22:37.493
When I bought it, the man said,
"Would you like red brake callipers?"

22:37.494 --> 22:41.813
And I said, "Yes, I would."
But Hammond, I was once in a pub,
and a man came up to me

22:41.814 --> 22:44.133
and he said,
"Do you want a smack in the mouth?"

22:44.134 --> 22:48.573
And I said no, because you can say
no! "Do you want some?" "No!"
You see?

22:48.574 --> 22:51.853
Did you have to pay extra for them?
Yes. How much? £300.

22:51.854 --> 22:56.093
But they look great...! How'd you
explain that to your family?!

22:56.094 --> 22:59.773
"I'm sorry, kids, we can't go to
Countrywide for our lunch this week

22:59.774 --> 23:04.173
"because Daddy's spent all the money
painting his brake callipers red."

23:04.174 --> 23:07.253
Hold on a minute. What?
He said they were £300.

23:07.254 --> 23:10.653
They won't be able to go to
Countrywide all year! Oi!

23:10.654 --> 23:14.293
Ooh, hey, listen. Hammond and I
went to Moscow last weekend.

23:14.294 --> 23:17.533
It wasn't a honeymoon thing. No,
more a spur-of-the-moment thing.

23:17.534 --> 23:19.933
We weren't hand-holding
or anything like that.

23:19.934 --> 23:22.653
There was some ice skating
going on in Red Square,

23:22.654 --> 23:25.093
we thought we'd go
and have a look at this.

23:25.094 --> 23:26.453
But there was...

23:26.454 --> 23:29.013
The only gap in the fence
where you could see, Audi,

23:29.014 --> 23:32.173
as a marketing thing, had parked
a Q3 there, so we couldn't see.

23:32.174 --> 23:35.373
So never mind, somebody told us
about this bar, OK?

23:35.374 --> 23:39.333
So 12th-story bar, and it overlooked
the Kremlin and Red Square
and Basil's.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.534
We thought big picture windows,
we'll have a look.

23:41.535 --> 23:44.533
So we went all the way over there,
climbed up the top.

23:44.534 --> 23:47.973
Now, Hammond took a picture
of the view we had - here it is.

23:47.974 --> 23:49.094
It was another...

23:49.095 --> 23:51.813
You can actually see
bits of the Kremlin,

23:51.814 --> 23:54.893
but mostly you could just see
the stupid Audi Q3.

23:54.894 --> 23:56.294
We hadn't gone to see that!

23:56.295 --> 23:58.693
Somebody at Audi
has obviously thought,

23:58.694 --> 24:02.253
"All these people are going to
these places to look at things,

24:02.254 --> 24:04.453
"so let's have them look
at our cars!"

24:04.454 --> 24:05.813
You are not joking.

24:05.814 --> 24:09.333
I've got a photo here of the
players' tunnel at Old Trafford.

24:09.334 --> 24:11.653
There you go. In the way!

24:11.654 --> 24:14.413
Giggs and Pearce there - or
whatever his name is, that ginger.

24:14.414 --> 24:17.413
But you can't see him cos there's
an Audi in the way! Exactly.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.693
I've got another picture
of the Grand Canyon.

24:19.694 --> 24:23.053
These are real pictures!
It's not just cars either.

24:23.054 --> 24:25.534
Fancy having a look at the Sydney
Opera House? Here it is.

24:25.535 --> 24:28.493
Oh, no! You can't see it, there's...
What are they doing?!

24:28.494 --> 24:30.894
We parked our boat in front of it!
What worries me

24:30.895 --> 24:33.813
is how many views in the world
that they could still ruin.

24:33.814 --> 24:35.533
Here's the Taj Mahal.

24:35.534 --> 24:37.813
I've always fancied
seeing the Pyramids.

24:37.814 --> 24:39.933
But you can't. There you are.

24:39.934 --> 24:43.693
Or the scene from Basic Instinct.
There you go.

24:43.694 --> 24:46.653
Once again, an Audi in the way
of what you actually want to see.

24:46.654 --> 24:51.453
OK. A couple of weeks ago,
the three of us went motor-racing,

24:51.454 --> 24:54.693
for something you'll see in next
week's show. I bring it up now

24:54.694 --> 24:59.253
because I discovered while racing
against Hammond that he is actually
Alain Prost.

24:59.254 --> 25:02.213
Really? You mean like
The Professor, calculating and...

25:02.214 --> 25:03.294
No, not that, no.

25:03.295 --> 25:07.413
What I mean is, when he has lost
the corner to a superior driver,

25:07.414 --> 25:10.853
he tries to ram that driver
off the road.

25:10.854 --> 25:13.693
I did not! You did! I remember
the corner. I rubbed you, at most.

25:13.694 --> 25:16.653
You rubbed me like David Haye
rubbed that man in Germany.

25:16.654 --> 25:19.893
That wasn't rubbing, mate! I ran
a bit... I leaned on you at most.

25:19.894 --> 25:22.333
I ran a bit wide.
Now hang on a minute.

25:22.334 --> 25:24.293
Because I wasn't in this race,

25:24.294 --> 25:26.854
but I was watching it
from a grassy knoll, and...

25:27.934 --> 25:31.493
I was! I think Hammond behaved
correctly. Thank you.

25:31.494 --> 25:34.213
I did. There were on-board cameras
in his car,

25:34.214 --> 25:37.613
so next week, we'll have a look
at the footage, and you'll see.

25:37.614 --> 25:41.773
You're right,
the on-board footage will be key
to it, but I will be the steward.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.813
I shall adjudicate.

25:43.814 --> 25:47.813
I'm not having you judging. What?
You can't play a game of Monopoly
without cheating.

25:47.814 --> 25:51.613
No, you can't. He did cheat
at Monopoly. I played these two
and he cheated!

25:51.614 --> 25:54.773
We played for four hours
and you cheated! I did not cheat!

25:54.774 --> 25:58.933
You ruined the game! You robbed
the bank! There was a...

25:58.934 --> 26:01.693
There was a bank robbery.
You don't get those in Monopoly,

26:01.694 --> 26:04.773
and I thought it would make it more
authentic if the bank was robbed.

26:04.774 --> 26:08.373
You stole it! So you're a cheat,
a liar and a burglar!

26:08.374 --> 26:10.854
If I'm going to use a judge
for this motoring incident,

26:10.855 --> 26:13.453
I'm going to use Ofcom,
because they are wise.

26:13.454 --> 26:15.453
Don't go there. Don't go there.
And you,

26:15.454 --> 26:18.573
you are going to be shot
in front of your family.
LAUGHTER

26:18.574 --> 26:22.493
Something, it turns out, you can say
on television. Oh, for God's sake!

26:22.494 --> 26:25.973
Yeah, what you've done there, Jeremy,
is taken leg out of the bear trap,

26:25.974 --> 26:28.453
turned round
and put your head in instead. Donk!

26:28.454 --> 26:32.653
You're an idiot. Anyway, that is
the end of the news. Now,

26:32.654 --> 26:34.693
matters more serious.

26:34.694 --> 26:38.013
Back in the Second World War,
the Top Gear test track was home,

26:38.014 --> 26:40.733
at one stage,
to a squadron of Spitfires.

26:40.734 --> 26:43.853
And the skies above it
were a giant blue canvas on which

26:43.854 --> 26:46.173
the brave airmen,
British and German,

26:46.174 --> 26:50.853
could weave their feathered artistry
using contrails and phosphorous.

26:50.854 --> 26:53.414
It must have been incredible.

26:56.454 --> 26:58.853
Suddenly we heard
the drone of planes behind us.

26:58.854 --> 27:01.133
Turned round and saw a line
of four fighters,

27:01.134 --> 27:05.573
and tracer bullets
from machine guns and pom-poms
were cutting through the air.

27:05.574 --> 27:10.134
There was beauty. There was death.
There was skill.

27:11.534 --> 27:13.814
And then there was the soundtrack...

27:16.294 --> 27:18.694
which today is back.

27:29.854 --> 27:34.493
What you're listening to here
is a 46-litre BMW V12,

27:34.494 --> 27:37.613
an engine that was originally used

27:37.614 --> 27:40.214
to power the Heinkel He 111 bomber.

27:44.534 --> 27:49.174
Only, as you can see here,
it's being used now to power a car.

27:51.614 --> 27:54.534
The car they call the Brutus.

28:01.094 --> 28:03.333
Well, when I say "car",

28:03.334 --> 28:08.933
the chassis is actually taken
from a 1907 New York fire engine.

28:08.934 --> 28:13.213
The chain drive from a machine
the Devil uses to rotisserie

28:13.214 --> 28:14.693
those who displease him.

28:14.694 --> 28:17.413
And the brakes, well, they exist

28:17.414 --> 28:21.974
only really in the imagination
of the madman who built this thing.

28:26.094 --> 28:28.453
A man so mad, he's going to let me

28:28.454 --> 28:32.013
take his extraordinary creation
for a spin.

28:32.014 --> 28:35.013
First, you pull on the fuel pumps.

28:35.014 --> 28:39.653
These are these two buttons
above the ignition. Yep.

28:39.654 --> 28:43.333
Then you have to pull out
this button. What's that one?

28:43.334 --> 28:47.413
This is the decompression.
Oh, Christ, right!

28:47.414 --> 28:52.094
And then you have to start with
the black button.

28:53.414 --> 28:54.694
A little gas.

29:00.494 --> 29:01.774
Whoa!

29:05.654 --> 29:09.254
All the explosions are happening
on the outside of the engine.

29:10.494 --> 29:13.414
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

29:29.334 --> 29:34.853
'Almost immediately, Brutus began to
spit hot oil into my face.'

29:34.854 --> 29:37.653
Aaah! What was that?!

29:37.654 --> 29:41.093
'And that was
just the start of my problems.'

29:41.094 --> 29:47.413
Oh! There's so much torque and so
little grip from the rear wheels,

29:47.414 --> 29:53.654
that if you even go near the
throttle, you get massive wheelspin.

29:55.374 --> 29:58.973
Look at that.
Oh, this is so complicated!

29:58.974 --> 30:02.573
All the controls
are on the outside of the car

30:02.574 --> 30:04.374
and the pedals
are the wrong way round.

30:04.375 --> 30:07.133
It's like trying to do
a crossword puzzle

30:07.134 --> 30:09.614
while you're being eaten by a tiger!

30:10.894 --> 30:13.134
No brakes, nothing. No.

30:14.174 --> 30:17.174
No point using the brakes,
they don't work.

30:18.574 --> 30:20.333
Turn! Turn, you brute!

30:20.334 --> 30:23.573
No, that's the wrong pedal!

30:23.574 --> 30:25.613
Yes, that's the throttle,
that's good.

30:25.614 --> 30:30.413
Basically, this is Sodom
and Gomorrah with a steering wheel.

30:30.414 --> 30:32.054
That's what it is.

30:33.614 --> 30:37.973
'Plainly, then, putting an aeroplane
engine in a car is idiotic.

30:37.974 --> 30:40.454
'Or is it?'

30:44.094 --> 30:48.293
'To the casual observer,
this looks like a '20s Bentley.

30:48.294 --> 30:50.813
'A car that won Le Mans four times.

30:50.814 --> 30:55.494
'A car Ettore Bugatti called
"the fastest lorry in the world". '

30:58.374 --> 31:00.853
'But actually, it
was built last year,

31:00.854 --> 31:04.374
'in Devon, by a man called Bob.'

31:07.094 --> 31:10.813
He and his little team
hand-crafted the aluminium body

31:10.814 --> 31:12.453
and the wooden frame.

31:12.454 --> 31:17.253
The chassis is from a 1930
Rolls-Royce Phantom, and the brakes?

31:17.254 --> 31:20.773
Well, they're big modern discs,
which are needed,

31:20.774 --> 31:23.374
because of what's under the bonnet.

31:26.334 --> 31:29.613
'In essence, that's
the same 27-litre V12

31:29.614 --> 31:33.534
'that you would find
in the front of a Spitfire.'

31:47.654 --> 31:51.493
Right. 64 litres of coolant

31:51.494 --> 31:58.173
and 54 litres of engine oil
are now circulating and warming up.

31:58.174 --> 32:00.253
What a thing.

32:00.254 --> 32:01.813
Here we go.

32:01.814 --> 32:04.334
We've got a gear there.

32:05.574 --> 32:08.533
'It may have modern brakes
and power steering

32:08.534 --> 32:14.213
'and an automatic gearbox,
but from behind the wheel...'

32:14.214 --> 32:16.773
God Almighty!

32:16.774 --> 32:20.054
'It feels about as modern
as James May's shoe-cleaning kit.'

32:21.174 --> 32:24.013
What I'm doing now is driving.

32:24.014 --> 32:28.134
In a modern car you just sit there
and things happen. Not in this!

32:30.014 --> 32:33.813
Massive sensory overload
as you drive around in it.

32:33.814 --> 32:37.453
And towering above everything
is the knowledge

32:37.454 --> 32:43.054
that up there under that bonnet
is the engine from a Spitfire!

32:44.334 --> 32:46.853
Putting a Spitfire engine in a car

32:46.854 --> 32:51.053
is like putting a whole
Jolokia chilli in a boiled egg.

32:51.054 --> 32:53.253
You're going to notice.

32:53.254 --> 32:56.013
And you do.

32:56.014 --> 32:57.694
You really do!

33:00.294 --> 33:06.014
They say it has a top speed
of 160mph.

33:07.494 --> 33:11.533
'But can it really be faster
than the insane Brutus?

33:11.534 --> 33:13.654
'Time, I think, for a drag race.'

33:14.654 --> 33:18.774
So. England vs Germany. Again.

33:23.974 --> 33:27.733
Three, two, one... Scramble!

33:27.734 --> 33:29.734
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

33:31.134 --> 33:34.374
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

33:36.774 --> 33:41.093
He's got 750 horsepower,
I've got 650.

33:41.094 --> 33:45.013
My car weighs three tons,
his weighs 2.4.

33:45.014 --> 33:49.533
He's got 46,000CC,

33:49.534 --> 33:51.534
I've only got 27,000. But look!

33:56.174 --> 34:00.013
Of course, it could be down to
the skill of the Tommy pilots.

34:00.014 --> 34:04.853
'So what about manoeuvrability?
What about the corners?

34:04.854 --> 34:08.134
'Well, let's cue the music
and find out.'

34:10.054 --> 34:17.013
Ahoy! I am Robert Shaw,
and once again, Dunsfold is

34:17.014 --> 34:20.893
echoing to the sound of
an Anglo-German dogfight.

34:27.893 --> 34:29.933
At this precise moment

34:29.934 --> 34:34.933
I would gladly swap my automatic
gearbox for eight Brownings.

34:34.934 --> 34:36.454
Da-ga-da-ga-da-ga!

34:37.373 --> 34:40.693
Truth be told, this was a walkover.

34:40.694 --> 34:43.734
The Brutus won't stop
and it won't corner.

34:43.774 --> 34:45.253
Come on, Jerry!

34:45.254 --> 34:47.493
Whereas the Bentley will.

34:47.494 --> 34:49.974
Come on! Oh, yes.

34:55.574 --> 34:58.213
This is a car
you really have to drive.

34:58.214 --> 35:01.213
You have to take it
by the scruff of the neck.

35:01.214 --> 35:03.053
You steer it using the throttle.

35:03.054 --> 35:06.213
If you want to get the back end out,
there's only one way to do so,

35:06.214 --> 35:09.414
and that's to give it a bootful
of power. There you go.

35:10.774 --> 35:15.333
This is one of those cars
where the greatness is measured

35:15.334 --> 35:18.053
only in the diameter

35:18.054 --> 35:21.254
of the driver's testicles.

35:23.734 --> 35:25.974
I love this thing. I love it!

35:29.574 --> 35:32.733
The fact is,
the Brutus was built for fun,

35:32.734 --> 35:35.093
to be a fairground attraction.

35:35.094 --> 35:38.734
It's just the Germans displaying
their usual sense of humour.

35:39.934 --> 35:44.093
The Bentley though is typically
British. It's much more serious.

35:44.094 --> 35:47.093
It's also exquisitely finished.

35:47.094 --> 35:50.733
The map light, for example,
is from a Lancaster bomber.

35:50.734 --> 35:53.013
The aviator's rear-view mirror

35:53.014 --> 35:56.373
incorporates an altimeter
and an air temperature gauge.

35:56.374 --> 36:00.773
This isn't a toy or a fairground
attraction. It's a real car.

36:00.774 --> 36:03.973
It even has squidgy carpets.

36:03.974 --> 36:08.774
And it's road legal. You could,
says Devon Bob, use it every day.

36:11.294 --> 36:15.853
If you did do that, I can imagine
there might be one or two issues.

36:15.854 --> 36:17.973
It's very cold in here.

36:17.974 --> 36:22.493
I'd imagine it's very hard to park
and it is quite conspicuous.

36:22.494 --> 36:26.934
It wouldn't really work if you were,
say, a private detective.

36:28.374 --> 36:30.973
People are going to notice you
following them.

36:30.974 --> 36:33.773
Then there's the fuel consumption.

36:33.774 --> 36:37.733
Realistically, it's going to do
two miles to the gallon.

36:37.734 --> 36:40.293
Three at a pinch.

36:40.294 --> 36:45.014
And filling the tank
would cost £420.

36:46.134 --> 36:49.773
Plus there's the cost of buying
the thing in the first place.

36:49.774 --> 36:52.654
It's £500,000.

36:54.174 --> 36:58.173
The thing is though,
if you have that kind of money,

36:58.174 --> 37:01.653
you could put it in the bank
and get half a percent interest

37:01.654 --> 37:05.413
and wake up every morning terrified
that the bank had gone bust.

37:05.414 --> 37:08.934
Or you could spend it
on one of these.

37:11.814 --> 37:16.454
Frankly, that's the easiest decision
you'd ever have to make.

37:30.774 --> 37:32.454
No, hang on.

37:33.534 --> 37:35.973
I'm not sure it is
the easiest decision.

37:35.974 --> 37:39.613
You know that Eagle E-Type Speedster
we had on the show last year?

37:39.614 --> 37:45.293
Yeah? That's half a million quid
as well. So which would you have?

37:45.294 --> 37:49.853
I'd still have this, I'm afraid.
It's very you.

37:49.854 --> 37:51.573
It's very desirable.

37:51.574 --> 37:54.773
I know what you mean but I think
I'd rather have the Eagle.

37:54.774 --> 37:58.773
It's very close. That's magnificent.
Anyway, that's by the by.

37:58.774 --> 38:03.733
Now it's time to find out how fast
both these magnificent machines
go round our track,

38:03.734 --> 38:07.733
which of course means handing them
over to our tame racing driver.

38:07.734 --> 38:11.773
Some say that he stores
all his shoes and his cassette tapes

38:11.774 --> 38:14.054
on the motorway central reservation.

38:15.134 --> 38:19.213
And that since he can easily
stay quiet for two hours,

38:19.214 --> 38:21.373
he's wondering why
he didn't win an Oscar!

38:21.374 --> 38:24.214
All we know is he's called
The Stig!

38:26.054 --> 38:27.973
And they're off.

38:27.974 --> 38:30.613
Popping and spluttering away
from the line,

38:30.614 --> 38:33.933
fuelled by fire
and lashings of hot brimstone.

38:33.934 --> 38:37.853
Moving at a stately pace
up to the first corner.

38:37.854 --> 38:39.693
Brutus is sliding.

38:39.694 --> 38:43.613
Stig actually has to look through
the steering wheel of that thing.

38:43.614 --> 38:48.053
Not a problem since he can also
see through walls... and clothes.

38:48.054 --> 38:51.573
OK. Coming through Chicago,
not looking fast

38:51.574 --> 38:54.094
but still rather splendid
all the same.

38:55.054 --> 38:58.293
So down now to the Hammerhead.
This could be interesting.

38:58.294 --> 39:02.174
The thing we've had on the track
this week basically has pram wheels.

39:03.494 --> 39:06.533
Both got a bit of a drift on.
Brutus is smoking.

39:06.534 --> 39:08.013
Is Jerry hit?

39:08.014 --> 39:11.054
No, it's just that massive engine
expressing its fury.

39:12.094 --> 39:15.733
OK, follow-through.
A chance to really open them up.

39:15.734 --> 39:19.973
Stig knows this sound well
from when he was a Spitfire pilot.

39:19.974 --> 39:22.293
Look at that. There they go!

39:22.294 --> 39:26.933
This does beg the question,
if the Bentley is capable of 160,

39:26.934 --> 39:29.333
how long would you need
to get there?

39:29.334 --> 39:34.293
Coming to the second to last corner.
Still going nicely.

39:34.294 --> 39:37.133
Two cathedrals going
through that there!

39:37.134 --> 39:39.294
And here we go across the line.

39:42.094 --> 39:44.453
I have the times here.

39:44.454 --> 39:47.533
The Brutus did it

39:47.534 --> 39:51.733
in 2:02.5.

39:51.734 --> 39:54.213
So that's down there,
second to last.

39:54.214 --> 39:57.293
16 minutes in front of
the pedal-powered Porsche.

39:57.294 --> 40:00.974
The Spitfire Bentley, 1:50.3.

40:02.574 --> 40:06.933
So 10 seconds faster and amazingly
slower than Hammond's tricycle,

40:06.934 --> 40:09.093
which is staggering. What?

40:09.094 --> 40:12.213
Before we go on.
Is that actually a supercharger?

40:12.214 --> 40:16.413
It's an oil cooler
made to look like a supercharger
so it looks like a Blower Bentley.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.973
So this isn't a supercharged engine?
No, it isn't.

40:18.974 --> 40:22.413
But a Spitfire's Merlin
was supercharged. But this isn't.

40:22.414 --> 40:25.853
Then that's the Meteor - the same
engine but the land-based version.

40:25.854 --> 40:29.333
Yes. The un-supercharged one.
Yes. And this obviously...

40:29.334 --> 40:32.213
Once again, we don't have time
for your lecture

40:32.214 --> 40:34.174
on all aeroplanes since 1941!

40:35.894 --> 40:39.293
I'm sorry but we do have to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

40:39.294 --> 40:42.293
Now, my guest tonight has
a farm in the Cotswolds

40:42.294 --> 40:45.973
where he makes cheese and yet
weirdly he's been chosen to headline

40:45.974 --> 40:50.173
the closing concert at this year's
Olympic Games.

40:50.174 --> 40:53.454
Ladies and gentlemen,
from Blur, Alex James!

40:58.974 --> 41:00.374
Have a seat.

41:03.654 --> 41:08.413
Now, first of all... I need coffee.
My heart is beating like a train.

41:08.414 --> 41:11.213
That is absolutely terrifying.
Being on the track?

41:11.214 --> 41:13.333
Oh, man. The Stig said just relax.

41:13.334 --> 41:17.893
Sit in a steel cage with a crash
helmet on and drive really fast...

41:17.894 --> 41:20.733
And relax! Easy-peasy lemon squeezy.

41:20.734 --> 41:23.653
I wanted to begin by congratulating
you heartily

41:23.654 --> 41:25.574
on your Lifetime Achievement Award.

41:25.575 --> 41:27.973
Thank you very much!

41:27.974 --> 41:32.773
At the BRITs.
It must have been something else.

41:32.774 --> 41:37.613
Well, it was utterly magnificent
to get back together

41:37.614 --> 41:40.053
and smash those songs out again.

41:40.054 --> 41:42.733
Were you aware while up on stage,
banging out tunes,

41:42.734 --> 41:44.973
that ITV had gone through
the credits

41:44.974 --> 41:48.653
and we were watching an advert
for panty liners and the news?

41:48.654 --> 41:51.134
Did anyone see that?
Were you watching the BRITs?

41:51.135 --> 41:53.813
They just cut it.
How many songs did we miss?

41:53.814 --> 41:55.853
No idea.
I was just up there rocking.

41:55.854 --> 41:59.533
They cut you off. I wanted to
watch Blur but we couldn't.

41:59.534 --> 42:03.853
Of course you are getting back
together because of the Olympics.

42:03.854 --> 42:08.853
The Olympics Closing Ceremony
Celebration Concert
is its full name.

42:08.854 --> 42:11.133
That's in Hyde Park?

42:11.134 --> 42:14.533
Yes. It's not the Olympics.
It's sort of a people's version.

42:14.534 --> 42:17.774
Nobody managed to get tickets
for the Olympics, have they?

42:19.814 --> 42:21.133
Who else is playing?

42:21.134 --> 42:25.373
We've got The Specials and New
Order. All our favourite bands.

42:25.374 --> 42:29.253
That's going to be August 12th
and it's all sold out

42:29.254 --> 42:32.173
and we have a new song to unveil.
You have a new song?

42:32.174 --> 42:35.973
Yeah. I listened to it this morning.
It's like a hymn, a real tearjerker.

42:35.974 --> 42:37.973
Fantastic. Look forward to that.

42:37.974 --> 42:42.293
It all began, your show business
career, when you were a Scout.

42:42.294 --> 42:45.773
It did, in a Gang Show.
I had to dress up as Big Brownie.

42:45.774 --> 42:49.573
It was quite a big part.
It was actually very good training.

42:49.574 --> 42:53.774
If you dressed up as a Brownie
in front of everyone,
you're not scared of Jeremy Paxman.

42:55.974 --> 42:58.733
How was the scoutmaster?
He did film it.

42:58.734 --> 43:02.533
He what?!
He filmed you as a Brownie?

43:02.534 --> 43:05.813
A little bit, yeah.
I never saw the film.

43:05.814 --> 43:08.253
Obviously after you'd been a Brownie

43:08.254 --> 43:12.613
you did hit the show business life
hard with Blur.

43:12.614 --> 43:17.493
Well, I think things
were different in those days.

43:17.494 --> 43:20.173
It gives you everything you want
when you're young,

43:20.174 --> 43:22.173
being in a kick-ass
rock 'n' roll band.

43:22.174 --> 43:25.453
Lots of travel, lots of girls,
lots of booze.

43:25.454 --> 43:29.493
What was that birthday party
in Mexico that I read about
in your first book?

43:29.494 --> 43:31.693
Go to bed, kids.

43:31.694 --> 43:33.773
Now!

43:33.774 --> 43:35.733
Yeah, your children.

43:35.734 --> 43:38.893
You go to bed while Daddy tells us
all about his birthday party.

43:38.894 --> 43:42.414
Where was it? Mexico?
Yeah. Great food in Mexico.

43:44.494 --> 43:48.173
This is like Hammerhead.
I'm looking for the exit!

43:48.174 --> 43:51.253
How far into your career with Blur
was it

43:51.254 --> 43:55.093
that the fans discovered
that your first love was cheese?

43:55.094 --> 43:58.493
Oh, before... I mean...

43:58.494 --> 44:02.693
They presented it to me
in hotel lobbies. Fans did? Yes.

44:02.694 --> 44:06.893
It was well known. I was well known
for enjoying cheese.

44:06.894 --> 44:09.653
In Smash Hits it said
"Alex likes cheese".

44:09.654 --> 44:13.333
It was like the one word thing
to describe me. Cheese? Cheese.

44:13.334 --> 44:16.773
Yeah. I mean, they threw it
at me in Japan,

44:16.774 --> 44:19.653
where it comes in tins!

44:19.654 --> 44:25.453
I'm not here to plug your book but
it's all Cheeses Great And Small,
yeah? Yes.

44:25.454 --> 44:30.733
You paint this fantastic picture
of becoming a farmer,
which is what you now are.

44:30.734 --> 44:34.373
I guess it's a love story, really.

44:34.374 --> 44:39.093
I was very much a man of the city
and a nocturnal creature.

44:39.094 --> 44:44.973
Then I met a girl, fell in love with
her and we got married very quickly

44:44.974 --> 44:50.693
and thought it would be
a really good idea to buy
a farm on our honeymoon.

44:50.694 --> 44:53.453
So we basically got married
and moved to a farm

44:53.454 --> 44:56.853
at the exact point
that Blur disintegrated.

44:56.854 --> 45:01.773
I very quickly realised I didn't
know very much about farming.

45:01.774 --> 45:05.613
How's it gone? Well?
I absolutely love it.

45:05.614 --> 45:09.933
So many musicians do end up
living on farms.

45:09.934 --> 45:12.413
It's sort of natural habitat.

45:12.414 --> 45:16.013
The toys are quite good.
You get a tractor.

45:16.014 --> 45:20.174
I haven't got a tractor. I've got
a mini digger that's a Cabriolet.

45:21.294 --> 45:25.213
It has an open cab. I had a dumper
this weekend, a three-foot dumper.

45:25.214 --> 45:30.054
£96.25. What? For the weekend,
including VAT.

45:32.694 --> 45:34.973
You really have got
into the whole thing.

45:34.974 --> 45:39.573
Your car history, that's not
so brilliant, looking into it.

45:39.574 --> 45:41.933
What are you talking about? Come on!

45:41.934 --> 45:45.133
Tell the ladies and gentlemen
what your first car was.

45:45.134 --> 45:48.973
It was a chocolate-brown Austin

45:48.974 --> 45:51.413
Allegro estate!

45:51.414 --> 45:55.413
There's another word for that
kind of brown as well.

45:55.414 --> 45:59.013
And the first three letters
of the registration were URD

45:59.014 --> 46:01.893
and it was known as
the Turd Machine!

46:01.894 --> 46:06.653
And it is the best car
I have ever, ever had because...

46:06.654 --> 46:10.053
This is going to be the longest
"because" in history.

46:10.054 --> 46:12.573
No, because of what it gave me.

46:12.574 --> 46:17.653
As a teenager, it's freedom, it's
romance, it's somewhere to smoke.

46:17.654 --> 46:23.413
You're absolutely right. After Blur,
you got rid of the Allegro?

46:23.414 --> 46:27.693
Yes. Doing world tours, you spend
so much of your time in airports.

46:27.694 --> 46:31.413
It's hard to describe. Well, it's
easy to describe! Many hours a day.

46:31.414 --> 46:36.093
If you're in Belgium today,
Frankfurt tomorrow,

46:36.094 --> 46:38.773
Lucerne the day after,
it's a lot of airports.

46:38.774 --> 46:42.093
The drummer and I
went halves on a Cessna.

46:42.094 --> 46:47.333
You went from an Allegro to
an aeroplane? Yeah! Half a Cessna.

46:47.334 --> 46:52.973
Sounds quite glamorous, maybe,
but it was like a flying Allegro.

46:52.974 --> 46:57.573
It wasn't posh. It didn't even
have a GPS. It was amazing.

46:57.574 --> 47:00.133
How do you navigate?

47:00.134 --> 47:02.893
A longwave radio that
picks up Morse code signals.

47:02.894 --> 47:07.573
So you can do Morse code?
Uh-huh. That's A!

47:07.574 --> 47:11.693
Is it? Don't tell James.
You'll be here for a week.

47:11.694 --> 47:15.173
We've established it was Allegro.

47:15.174 --> 47:18.933
Allegro, half a Cessna. Half
a Cessna, which was like an Allegro.

47:18.934 --> 47:24.173
After that, well, I've got a van
now, a black van. Five kids. Nice.

47:24.174 --> 47:28.693
A van? It's a black Mercedes Viano.

47:28.694 --> 47:32.453
It's got eight seats, which is
room for five kids and Granny.

47:32.454 --> 47:36.933
TV screens? No, not TV screens.

47:36.934 --> 47:40.574
I think it's really important
for children to get bored in cars.

47:42.014 --> 47:46.973
That's how I really got into music,
listening to the top 40 in the car
on a Sunday afternoon.

47:46.974 --> 47:50.453
But no TV screens for the kids?
Oh, deary me, no. No.

47:50.454 --> 47:56.373
I rang you last night to see
if you were ready to come down
and do this show

47:56.374 --> 47:59.733
and you were playing this track
on a computer game.

47:59.734 --> 48:02.733
I couldn't get it in time. Oh, no!

48:02.734 --> 48:05.213
I wanted to do it on the Xbox.

48:05.214 --> 48:09.614
How did you prepare to do this,
then? I just had six cups of coffee!

48:11.174 --> 48:13.093
Who would like to see Alex's lap?

48:13.094 --> 48:15.133
Yes!
Let's have a look.

48:15.134 --> 48:17.094
Play the tape and here we go.

48:19.814 --> 48:22.013
Once again, we're off.

48:22.014 --> 48:26.773
This is how we get the groceries in,
in my house!

48:26.774 --> 48:29.374
Actually, where are you going?

48:30.614 --> 48:34.093
Braking, accelerating, turning in,
all manner of things.

48:34.094 --> 48:36.133
Oh, dear. Too wide.

48:36.134 --> 48:38.333
Bit too wide but not too bad.

48:38.334 --> 48:39.934
Oh, nuts!

48:41.494 --> 48:45.574
Now that is wide! Yeah, you could
catch a bus to the Apex there.

48:46.854 --> 48:49.853
♪ I'm a superstar
waiting to explode ♪

48:49.854 --> 48:54.294
♪ I'm a driver
Go, go, go, go explode! ♪

48:55.694 --> 49:00.174
Second week on the trot
we've had somebody singing
their way round the Hammerhead.

49:01.414 --> 49:04.293
Just about kept it in the lines.

49:04.294 --> 49:08.653
Tortured tyres. Poor old Cee'd.

49:08.654 --> 49:11.893
Come on. Let's rock, baby. Woo hoo!

49:11.894 --> 49:16.853
Follow-through. Were you flat out
through there? Yes. Good.

49:16.854 --> 49:20.453
Were you flat out through there?
Yes, yeah. That's hairy.

49:20.454 --> 49:23.453
Excellent. Avoiding
the uncomfortable bump

49:23.454 --> 49:27.374
and into the second to last corner.
Wobbly on the way in... Oh!

49:30.454 --> 49:34.853
I'm afraid I have to explain this.
We allowed the lap this week

49:34.854 --> 49:36.254
to be edited by ITV...

49:43.014 --> 49:46.374
so we'll never know
what happened at the end.

49:47.574 --> 49:52.413
So, anyway, um... I've got the time,
don't you worry about that.

49:52.414 --> 49:56.293
Where do you think
you've come on the board?

49:56.294 --> 49:59.373
It was wide, it was noisy,
it was... It was wide and noisy

49:59.374 --> 50:01.573
and a lot of tyre squeal,
which indicates

50:01.574 --> 50:04.453
the tyres are making a noise
rather than getting you going.

50:04.454 --> 50:07.133
Yeah, I... You know,
I think, bottom half, but...

50:07.134 --> 50:10.413
Near Bob Geldof,
that's comfortable. Al Murray.

50:10.414 --> 50:15.453
Near Bob Geldof, that's a 1.48.
OK, well, Alex James you did it...

50:15.454 --> 50:17.973
in 1...

50:17.974 --> 50:19.973
45... Ooh.

50:19.974 --> 50:21.414
Point 2, so you're way ahead

50:21.415 --> 50:24.533
of where you thought
you were going to be!

50:24.534 --> 50:26.094
You are, in fact...

50:29.174 --> 50:31.694
level with Cameron Diaz.

50:34.654 --> 50:36.933
So, just tell us...

50:36.934 --> 50:39.933
is there going to be an album?
Tell us, tell us...

50:39.934 --> 50:44.453
No, there's not. Just this one song
that you're going to be performing
at the Olympics?

50:44.454 --> 50:47.413
Well, well done for that,
for the lifetime achievement award

50:47.414 --> 50:49.653
and of course, most of all,
well done for that.

50:49.654 --> 50:52.014
Ladies and gentlemen, Alex James.
Thank you.

50:57.774 --> 50:59.013
Now,

50:59.014 --> 51:02.053
earlier on, we found out
which of these...

51:02.054 --> 51:05.373
the £30,000 Morgan three-wheeler,

51:05.374 --> 51:10.613
the £40,000 Caterham R500,
or the £50,000 KTM X-Bow...

51:10.614 --> 51:14.053
made the most convincing
track-day car.

51:14.054 --> 51:18.053
Thing is, if you're going to
spend that much money on a car,

51:18.054 --> 51:20.653
you want it to do something else.

51:20.654 --> 51:24.493
Can they? For instance,
could you use them to go to work?

51:24.494 --> 51:26.414
We decided to find out.

51:29.654 --> 51:32.653
Getting to work would involve
going from London

51:32.654 --> 51:36.734
to just south of Guildford.
It's about 40 miles.

51:40.614 --> 51:42.254
Right.

51:44.414 --> 51:47.773
Now, as we know, once a man
is past the age of 28,

51:47.774 --> 51:52.093
he may not, under any circumstances,
drive through a built-up area

51:52.094 --> 51:54.853
with the roof down
on his convertible car,

51:54.854 --> 51:57.973
but I have no roof.
I have no choice.

51:57.974 --> 52:00.933
And what I'm saying to onlookers is,
"Driving is my hobby,

52:00.934 --> 52:02.733
"I'm very keen on it."

52:02.734 --> 52:05.413
And that's a bit like a keen angler

52:05.414 --> 52:08.734
going to work in some waders.

52:13.214 --> 52:15.773
The difficult thing
about driving a Caterham

52:15.774 --> 52:18.693
in slow-moving traffic like this
is not the clutch,

52:18.694 --> 52:20.813
or the gearbox
or anything like that.

52:20.814 --> 52:23.933
It's that you feel a...
A bit of a berk, if you're honest.

52:23.934 --> 52:26.333
I mean, a lot of people
will be driving past

52:26.334 --> 52:28.493
and their children will be saying,

52:28.494 --> 52:31.974
"Daddy, why's that man's car's
windscreen fallen off?"

52:33.254 --> 52:35.293
Morning, Jason. You all right?

52:35.294 --> 52:39.094
Obviously, I know everybody
in Hammersmith.

52:43.734 --> 52:47.293
I feel some people may be
making character judgements

52:47.294 --> 52:50.733
based on the RAF roundels
and pretend bullet-holes,

52:50.734 --> 52:55.093
scantily clad ladies
adorning my three-wheeled car.

52:55.094 --> 52:57.293
The fact is, I'm not really
a fighter pilot,

52:57.294 --> 53:02.013
nobody has ever shot bullets
at this car, they're just stick-on.

53:02.014 --> 53:05.293
Ah. Speed humps, let's...
Woo-hoo! Ooh, yeah.

53:05.294 --> 53:08.613
The front two wheels, sort of,
went either side of it,

53:08.614 --> 53:12.653
but the middle wheel at the back...
Eurgh... puts me out a bit.

53:12.654 --> 53:13.894
Eurgh.

53:15.414 --> 53:20.773
Just outside London, we met up at
a service station to compare notes.

53:20.774 --> 53:23.573
Is this the worst trip to work
you've ever had? Not so far.

53:23.574 --> 53:25.694
Mine's the most embarrassing.

53:26.974 --> 53:29.933
If you were going to work today
to a factory that you owned

53:29.934 --> 53:32.093
to lay off ALL of the staff...

53:32.094 --> 53:34.653
my car would not be the car
to make that journey in.

53:34.654 --> 53:40.453
Or, "I'm going to have to tell that
patient the news is not good."

53:40.454 --> 53:42.653
Or if you were a funeral director.
No. No, no.

53:42.654 --> 53:45.773
"I'm very sorry about your loss."

53:45.774 --> 53:46.974
'Since we were in no hurry

53:46.975 --> 53:49.613
'to get back on display
in the rush hour traffic,

53:49.614 --> 53:52.573
'I decided to kill some time
with a little challenge.'

53:52.574 --> 53:56.133
If you can start that car
with that key,

53:56.134 --> 53:58.773
I will give you this crisp £10 note.

53:58.774 --> 54:02.213
How long have I got?
Long as you like. Take a week.

54:02.214 --> 54:07.054
It can't be that hard. There'll be
an immobiliser button somewhere.

54:08.294 --> 54:10.853
So, is there a hole for this key?
Oh, yes.

54:10.854 --> 54:13.413
Right. So, they'll have...
Let's think about this.

54:13.414 --> 54:16.853
They'll have put it somewhere...
Does it go in there? What, like that?

54:16.854 --> 54:19.773
I seriously want to try
and do it. Yeah. Yeah.

54:19.774 --> 54:22.413
I think THAT'S going to have
something to do with it.

54:22.414 --> 54:25.334
Well, it does. It says,
"Ignition on." Right. Hang on.

54:26.454 --> 54:27.574
Stopwatch, lights...

54:27.575 --> 54:29.534
Horn.

54:33.214 --> 54:34.733
Cold.

54:34.734 --> 54:37.693
Let's face it...
Have you got the clutch? Yes.

54:37.694 --> 54:40.453
So, I think "mode"... No.
Could have something to do...

54:40.454 --> 54:42.013
But that does set the ignition.

54:42.014 --> 54:45.093
No, there's another button
in there which is ve... Yeah!

54:45.094 --> 54:48.573
So, that button says start,
but that could be a trick.

54:48.574 --> 54:51.133
It IS a trick. Now press "stop".

54:51.134 --> 54:52.933
A-ha! Right.

54:52.934 --> 54:57.053
So you press "stop" first...
Yes... and then "start"?

54:57.054 --> 54:58.613
"Mode".

54:58.614 --> 55:00.653
Oh, this is idiotic.

55:00.654 --> 55:03.373
It's perfectly straightforward.
Ignition on,

55:03.374 --> 55:07.493
key in, press "stop"
till there's a clonk.

55:07.494 --> 55:09.693
Press "mode" once it says,
"Ready to race,"

55:09.694 --> 55:11.973
then put your foot on the clutch,

55:11.974 --> 55:13.973
then the brake FULLY down,

55:13.974 --> 55:16.573
THEN press start, then it begins.

55:16.574 --> 55:18.693
The "stop" being
the button to start it, is,

55:18.694 --> 55:21.254
with the best will in the world,
a bit misleading.

55:23.054 --> 55:25.413
And a mad starting procedure

55:25.414 --> 55:28.493
is only one of many things wrong
with Jeremy's X-Bow.

55:28.494 --> 55:32.374
The turning circle's just shocking.
Oh, God.

55:35.334 --> 55:36.854
Come on!

55:38.254 --> 55:43.174
By the time we were back on the A3,
the weather had changed.

55:45.454 --> 55:47.614
No! No, it's raining!

55:55.214 --> 55:58.334
It's hurting my face. It's agony.

56:00.654 --> 56:03.733
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

56:03.734 --> 56:06.774
Ow and mega-ow!

56:07.934 --> 56:12.254
Oh, God. I need a hat or some...
Oh, Jesus wept.

56:14.294 --> 56:17.533
My right hand is completely frozen.
It's just a claw.

56:17.534 --> 56:20.933
Also, there are holes in the floor
behind the pedals,

56:20.934 --> 56:24.133
and all the air, and the wind,

56:24.134 --> 56:28.493
and the rain is going up
my trouser legs.

56:28.494 --> 56:31.573
Also, rain is running off
my jacket into my lap.

56:31.574 --> 56:35.133
None of these things
are good news for my genitalia,

56:35.134 --> 56:37.534
which has run away.

56:44.294 --> 56:47.973
If you're watching, Caterham...
Heater.

56:47.974 --> 56:49.614
And windscreen!

56:50.974 --> 56:54.693
'BBC London, 94.9...'

56:54.694 --> 56:58.253
'And finally, the weather. It's not
looking good out there, I'm afraid,

56:58.254 --> 57:01.053
'with a maximum temperature
of just one degree Celsius,

57:01.054 --> 57:04.974
'and the rain is expected to get
heavier as the day goes on.'

57:08.574 --> 57:10.413
Oh...

57:10.414 --> 57:13.374
I am going to have treble pneumonia.

57:15.254 --> 57:17.614
There's going to be
no doubt about that.

57:19.494 --> 57:21.573
'We were all so miserable,

57:21.574 --> 57:24.854
'we decided that even
shopping would be preferable.'

57:30.814 --> 57:33.853
I just hope I can still
do the seatbelts up.

57:33.854 --> 57:35.654
What? Oh, my seat's wet.

57:41.414 --> 57:42.493
Chaps.

57:42.494 --> 57:44.973
Are you on motor-bicycles?

57:44.974 --> 57:48.173
Are they KTM motor-bicycles?
Two of them are.

57:48.174 --> 57:52.533
Can I just say, KTM is the stupidest
company in the world? Well said.

57:52.534 --> 57:54.293
That is ridiculous.

57:54.294 --> 57:56.493
Right then. Oh, wow.

57:56.494 --> 57:59.893
Look, it's Douglas Bader-Meinhof.

57:59.894 --> 58:02.173
Come on, then. Let's get on with it.

58:02.174 --> 58:06.413
12 more miles of abject misery
and then I can pretend

58:06.414 --> 58:10.214
I've never heard the words
"KTM", "cross" or "bow."

58:18.934 --> 58:23.173
Oh... I've been coming to work
now down here for ten years.

58:23.174 --> 58:26.733
I've never had to stop and buy
another outfit on the way,

58:26.734 --> 58:28.414
I've never been so miserable.

58:29.494 --> 58:31.534
Urgh.

58:33.294 --> 58:36.693
OK, this is getting heavier now,
and it is becoming less pleasant.

58:36.694 --> 58:40.453
It wouldn't make a very good
wedding car for winter weddings.

58:40.454 --> 58:43.893
That's another thing
it wouldn't be good for.

58:43.894 --> 58:47.453
One of the other advantages
of the traditional car windscreen

58:47.454 --> 58:51.134
is that you can have
windscreen wipers on it. I just...

58:52.894 --> 58:54.974
It'd be nice to be able to see.

59:02.694 --> 59:04.934
And here we are. At work.

59:06.254 --> 59:08.734
Frankly, I wish it was the gallows.

59:09.734 --> 59:12.414
Oh, bloody hellfire.

59:15.134 --> 59:19.733
The bit of your face that's exposed
has gone all funny.

59:19.734 --> 59:22.893
It's got mud and bits of stones on
it. You know when you find a potato

59:22.894 --> 59:26.573
that's been in the bottom of
the fridge for a while?
It's rotted your face off.

59:26.574 --> 59:31.253
My job, from now on,
is to drive cars with roofs.

59:31.254 --> 59:33.894
And with that, back to the studio.

59:36.254 --> 59:39.693
Did you tell him about your claw?
Yeah, my hands. My face was a claw.

59:39.694 --> 59:44.133
I had three claws.
Anyway, can I just say,

59:44.134 --> 59:47.293
for around the same
sort of money as the KTM,

59:47.294 --> 59:51.253
you could have a BMW M3,
which is a good track-day car.

59:51.254 --> 59:53.174
It is also good
for taking you to work,

59:53.175 --> 59:55.893
taking the kids to school,
going to the supermarket,

59:55.894 --> 59:59.133
it has a roof, has a heater,
has a windscreen, has windows.

59:59.134 --> 01:00:01.333
It is amazing that we
have reached a point

01:00:01.334 --> 01:00:03.853
in the development
of our civilisation

01:00:03.854 --> 01:00:07.173
where you can buy a car
that does only one thing.

01:00:07.174 --> 01:00:10.733
Yes, I know what you mean.
My Morgan, it turns out, is brilliant

01:00:10.734 --> 01:00:13.653
for taking one friend
to the pub on two days in June.

01:00:13.654 --> 01:00:19.693
The Caterham is superb for blasting
around Simply Sausages...

01:00:19.694 --> 01:00:23.373
No, no. Everywhere else
in the world, all racetracks,

01:00:23.374 --> 01:00:25.493
they're called the Tag Heuer
or the Red Bull

01:00:25.494 --> 01:00:27.893
but Donnington is sponsored
by Simply Sausages

01:00:27.894 --> 01:00:30.213
and it is very good
at getting round it.

01:00:30.214 --> 01:00:32.213
It is brilliant at Simply Sausages,

01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:35.213
and yours is frankly peerless
at making you look like a cock.

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:38.493
Oh, it's brilliant. It is.
What we've got here are three cars,

01:00:38.494 --> 01:00:41.733
they're like Swiss Army knives
where there's only one attachment,

01:00:41.734 --> 01:00:44.653
and it's that prong for getting
a stone out of a horse's hoof.

01:00:44.654 --> 01:00:47.733
That's all they are, and on that
bombshell, it is time to end.

01:00:47.734 --> 01:00:50.534
Thank you for watching,
see you next week. Goodnight.
