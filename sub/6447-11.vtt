IMRA:
Hey, guys.

37:22.991 --> 37:27.280
Looks brand-new.
I guess it's time to go home.

37:27.454 --> 37:29.695
You sure you wanna take that with you?

37:30.790 --> 37:35.329
I'm sure we'll be able to reprogram what's
left of Brainiac into something useful.

37:36.087 --> 37:39.250
Let's hope Brainiac 5
is a little more friendly.

37:41.009 --> 37:43.045
I'm sorry I doubted you, Kal.

37:43.345 --> 37:47.338
You did stop Brainiac
and without taking a life.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.506
There's always a way, Rokk.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.639
If it ever seems like there isn't, remember
what we accomplished here today.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.263
Preserve life at all costs.

37:56.441 --> 37:59.649
That will be the number one rule
in Legion code from now on.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.572
It truly was an honor.

38:07.869 --> 38:10.201
If you ever wanna meet
the rest of the Legion...

38:10.664 --> 38:12.279
...just put this ring on.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.000
I've reprogrammed it for time travel only.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.745
No ﬂights. Not yet.

38:19.923 --> 38:23.836
So it looks like you're gonna have to learn
to ﬂy without training wheels.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.251
Just focus on 3009.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.135
We'll be there to greet you.

38:28.765 --> 38:30.426
Thanks.

38:31.768 --> 38:34.475
But I think I'll stick closer
to my time zone for a while.

38:40.735 --> 38:43.272
We do hope we see you again.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.829
Kal.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.786
Be careful in the days ahead.

39:14.728 --> 39:16.969
Long live the Legion.

39:37.792 --> 39:40.955
I didn't think you were much for jewelry.

39:41.963 --> 39:44.750
I'm not. It was a going-away gift.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.256
It's strange to meet people
who know exactly where you're going.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.672
Exactly when you're gonna get there.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.226
Well, they don't know everything.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.729
I mean, if they did,
Chloe wouldn't be alive right now.

40:03.026 --> 40:06.143
And unfortunately,
they didn't have what I had.

40:06.321 --> 40:09.779
Human parents who taught me more
than just how to use my abilities.

40:11.534 --> 40:14.196
They have a different role model.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.997
With everything I've learned,
everything I've been through...

40:23.379 --> 40:25.290
...apparently, I'm just getting started.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.881
According to the Legion...

40:29.677 --> 40:33.340
...I will accomplish things so legendary,
I'll be known throughout the galaxy.

40:33.515 --> 40:34.755
[SCOFFS]

40:37.102 --> 40:39.809
And you're not sure that you'll be able
to live up to that.

40:44.943 --> 40:49.983
Clark, there is no doubt in my mind
that you will.

40:53.034 --> 40:56.276
Just do it on your schedule, not theirs.

40:58.790 --> 41:02.499
Well, did they happen to mention
anything about your place in history?

41:02.669 --> 41:04.455
A little.

41:05.046 --> 41:07.583
But the way I see it,
it doesn't really matter.

41:09.801 --> 41:13.714
Our destiny, it's not written
in some book in the future.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.426
We write it ourselves, every day.

41:21.104 --> 41:25.393
And the question is,
what do we write next?

41:34.409 --> 41:36.695
