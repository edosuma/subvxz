The <i>We Like To Move It Crew</i>.

00:13.503 --> 00:16.097
- What are we looking at, here?
- Isn't it obvious?

00:16.265 --> 00:18.100
Looks like a regular fish, to me.

00:18.268 --> 00:19.936
That's because it is.

00:22.797 --> 00:23.897
Fantastic.

00:24.142 --> 00:26.434
Thanks for clearing that up.
Meeting adjourned.

00:26.559 --> 00:27.375
Wait!

00:27.778 --> 00:29.341
It's a regular fish now.

00:29.466 --> 00:33.032
But when I zap it with my super ray,
it will be a super fish.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.640
Then, when we eat super fish,

00:34.765 --> 00:37.244
We'll get stronger bones,
denser muscle mass

00:37.517 --> 00:40.193
and, best of all,
remarkably shiny feathers.

00:40.318 --> 00:41.685
Aces, Kowalski.

00:42.072 --> 00:44.085
I thought you'd finally cracked.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.672
Keep an eye on him.
He's finally cracked.

00:48.648 --> 00:49.464
Boring.

00:49.773 --> 00:51.575
Don't like.
Don't want.

00:51.927 --> 00:54.720
Don't care.
Used to like, not anymore. Pass.

00:55.692 --> 00:57.360
Wait!
Was that a mango?

00:57.485 --> 01:00.538
So sweet and tangy
and juicy and sweet.

01:00.956 --> 01:02.890
Did I say "sweet" twice?
It doesn't matter.

01:03.015 --> 01:04.849
A mango can be sweetie sweet.

01:05.385 --> 01:08.234
And now it's gone forever!

01:08.402 --> 01:09.694
I'll get it.

01:10.192 --> 01:11.746
Wait!
Mort, come back!

01:12.476 --> 01:14.532
That mango
went into the gorilla pen.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.981
We must do something.

01:17.265 --> 01:20.426
But I cannot be leaping into action
on an empty stomach.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.285
Mango, where are you?

01:30.532 --> 01:31.746
Mango!

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:43.145 --> 01:44.979
- Yo, Bing.
- Badda?

01:46.533 --> 01:48.447
We got us a trespasser.

01:49.017 --> 01:50.438
We got us a thief.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.308
You know what we do with thieves,
around here?

01:53.433 --> 01:54.780
Kissies and huggies?

01:55.703 --> 01:57.533
Thieves get bounced.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.914
All systems are go.
Prepare for laser enrichment.

02:10.562 --> 02:12.256
Pretty light tickles.

02:15.883 --> 02:18.220
Good heavens!
Mort, are you...

02:18.501 --> 02:20.806
I mean, look at...
How do you feel?

02:21.728 --> 02:23.348
I'm muscley!

02:24.026 --> 02:24.977
I love it!

02:26.488 --> 02:28.037
Wait, I need to do...

02:29.103 --> 02:29.815
Tests.

02:32.246 --> 02:33.977
Is this gonna be a problem?

02:35.770 --> 02:38.579
It was then I realized
that I must focus

02:38.704 --> 02:42.160
on the most importantest thing
in all of the life:

02:42.846 --> 02:45.122
Me.
Are you getting all this?

02:47.137 --> 02:48.250
I got it all.

02:48.923 --> 02:51.003
Okay, then. Chapter two.

02:54.599 --> 02:56.842
What... is that... are you...

02:57.010 --> 02:58.118
Is Mort back?

02:58.243 --> 03:01.097
Did he bring the sweetie sweet sweetness
of mango?

03:03.520 --> 03:05.072
Mort failed.

03:08.706 --> 03:11.439
Mort, how many times
am I telling you?

03:11.669 --> 03:13.567
One: No touching the royal feet.

03:13.792 --> 03:15.820
Two: No failing the royal me.

03:16.191 --> 03:17.062
Sorry.

03:17.612 --> 03:19.198
I get mango now.

03:19.751 --> 03:22.827
You didn't notice anything different
about Mort?

03:24.750 --> 03:27.416
He's obviously doing something different
with his hair.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.962
It's nice, actually.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.836
- You want your mango?
- Yes, please.

03:32.435 --> 03:33.930
Tell you what, friend.

03:34.055 --> 03:35.821
We're not givin' it to you.

03:35.946 --> 03:38.849
- So what you gonna do?
- Beat us up?

03:41.577 --> 03:43.180
I said, "beat us up."

03:54.502 --> 03:56.051
Here, take a mango.

03:56.176 --> 03:58.050
Take some bananas too.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.809
Please.
Just don't hurt us no more, okay?

04:02.493 --> 04:04.744
You got all this from the gorillas?

04:05.502 --> 04:06.452
You like?

04:07.250 --> 04:08.644
I like very much.

04:08.769 --> 04:10.750
How did you do such a thing?

04:10.918 --> 04:13.044
They told me to beat them up,
so I did.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.525
Don't be ridiculous.

04:14.650 --> 04:18.149
You are far too puny
to beat up such big gorillas.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.135
Your Majesty,
take a really good look at Mort.

04:26.425 --> 04:30.464
Now that you mention it,
I suppose he is a bit... buff.

04:30.589 --> 04:31.354
A bit?

04:31.522 --> 04:34.023
- He's huge, man!
- It's true.

04:34.414 --> 04:37.401
And because of this hugeness,
you got things?

04:37.920 --> 04:40.905
Perhaps I can be using this
to my advantage.

04:42.192 --> 04:43.205
Elephant!

04:43.723 --> 04:46.162
Give to me your peanuts.

04:46.670 --> 04:48.862
Sorry, I don't have any.

04:50.628 --> 04:51.665
Check the trunk.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.133
Why do you lot want my hay?
You blokes don't even eat the stuff.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.178
No, but there's something else
I like to do with it.

05:06.788 --> 05:08.561
Make macrames.

05:09.059 --> 05:09.816
Nice?

05:09.941 --> 05:13.896
Touch me hair again,
and I'll snap you like a pencil.

05:14.064 --> 05:14.874
Really?

05:14.999 --> 05:18.121
Listen,
if there is to be any snapping,

05:18.246 --> 05:21.126
It will be you
who is the broken pencil, my friend.

05:24.921 --> 05:25.908
Get him off me!

05:27.228 --> 05:28.426
Good day to you!

05:29.673 --> 05:31.914
Tell me you've got
that antidote figured out.

05:33.643 --> 05:35.419
Got nothing.
No matter what I do,

05:35.544 --> 05:39.356
The formula's molecular structure fails
to achieve low-energy orbitals.

05:42.211 --> 05:44.468
Tart.
Have you tried adding sugar?

05:45.096 --> 05:48.180
Please. This is an intricate problem
that requires that...

05:49.244 --> 05:50.725
Sugar!
Of course.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.002
That's the answer.

05:52.127 --> 05:55.062
The monosaccharide will stabilize
the entire solution.

05:55.951 --> 05:57.247
Good job, Private.

05:57.753 --> 06:00.901
Well, I thought it needed
the monostereo... thing.

06:03.278 --> 06:04.238
Eureka!

06:04.546 --> 06:06.285
This will do the trick.

06:06.410 --> 06:09.076
Saddle up, men.
We've got a job to do.

06:11.140 --> 06:13.923
Using Mort's muscles
to loot all this loot

06:14.048 --> 06:15.443
was geniusness.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.105
I really must compliment my brain.

06:18.352 --> 06:19.611
Brain, good job.

06:20.698 --> 06:24.218
I thought it nice to have an idea
you didn't pull out of your booty.

06:25.045 --> 06:27.820
Do not speak ill of the booty.
Booty, booty, booty.

06:27.945 --> 06:30.529
Shut up about the booty!
You shut up about the shutting up.

06:30.654 --> 06:33.605
I am not talking to you.
Fine, I am not talking to you,

06:33.730 --> 06:34.828
stupid brain.

06:36.199 --> 06:39.396
Anyway, now I will dive
into my Mort gotten loot.

06:42.133 --> 06:43.652
Can Mort have banana?

06:44.039 --> 06:47.698
Mort, you silly billy.
Of course you can't have a banana.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.658
This is the royal loot.

06:54.390 --> 06:55.190
But...

06:57.883 --> 07:00.753
I want banana!

07:03.590 --> 07:05.591
Give me a banana!

07:06.524 --> 07:08.260
Maurice, do something.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.430
- Like give him a banana?
- Don't be ridiculous.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.475
Mort, now,
let's not do anything hasty.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.908
You no bully Mort no more!

07:20.629 --> 07:23.526
You may have those.
They were a little green, anyway.

07:23.694 --> 07:27.207
You might want to peel... no? Okay.
You do whatever makes you happy.

07:28.318 --> 07:30.182
Mort cuddle feet!

07:40.158 --> 07:42.055
Sorry, sorry.
Had an itchiness.

07:42.180 --> 07:45.018
Go back to the foot-cuddling.
Pretend I'm not here.

07:45.143 --> 07:47.013
I am pretending I'm not here.

07:50.457 --> 07:52.404
Thank goodness it is...

07:53.285 --> 07:54.849
Mort cuddle feet!

07:55.272 --> 07:58.806
What you lemurs do with your feet
Is your own business, Mort.

07:58.931 --> 08:02.354
But when you terrorize the whole zoo,
it becomes ours.

08:04.069 --> 08:07.361
Given that we turned Mort
into the threat, wasn't it our problem?

08:07.529 --> 08:08.858
Not now, Private.

08:09.149 --> 08:11.686
Anyway, you're drinking
this antidote pronto.

08:11.811 --> 08:14.744
It'll reverse the unfortunate
freakish effects of the super ray.

08:15.558 --> 08:17.996
Mort don't want antidote.

08:19.050 --> 08:20.470
Can't... feel...

08:20.949 --> 08:22.334
royal... toes.

08:23.099 --> 08:24.795
Mort like big!

08:29.028 --> 08:29.960
Oh, boy.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.006
Mort like strong!

08:34.607 --> 08:36.640
Nobody boss Mort around!

08:36.970 --> 08:39.548
He's in berserker mode.
Retreat, men, retreat.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.149
Open up.
It's medicine time.

08:50.612 --> 08:53.822
Now, Mort, let's take a moment
to gather ourselves.

08:53.947 --> 08:55.223
Yes, please.

08:55.859 --> 08:57.369
Has anyone seen my spleen?

08:57.537 --> 09:00.122
I know you don't want to go back
to being little bullied Mort.

09:00.390 --> 09:03.375
Still, might be a nice change of pace.
Let's give it a swirl.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.141
But, Mort,
there's a natural order of things,

09:06.425 --> 09:08.334
And being little and loveable...

09:09.007 --> 09:10.591
Mort hate little.

09:19.173 --> 09:20.184
It does tickle!

09:33.740 --> 09:36.051
I like beating up!

09:41.410 --> 09:42.805
Kowalski, options.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.524
Only one, Skipper.

09:45.027 --> 09:47.904
Close your eyes
so you don't see it coming.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.301
What the deuce?

10:00.526 --> 10:02.017
Big penguin.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.688
And you're supposed
to be little lemur.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.566
So take your medicine now!

10:19.255 --> 10:21.110
I'm normal me again.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.463
And I like me!

10:25.167 --> 10:28.134
But I hope you've learned
a lesson of value.

10:28.259 --> 10:30.937
Being a bully is no good.

10:31.062 --> 10:32.381
Wait a minute.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.592
You used Mort
to bully everyone else.

10:35.344 --> 10:36.566
Maurice, please.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.835
We don't play the blame game here.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.053
All of the blame is mine.

10:44.178 --> 10:46.516
Just don't sit upon me.

10:49.506 --> 10:52.220
Nothing left to do
but whip up another batch of antidote.

10:52.345 --> 10:54.361
Actually, I don't think
that'll be necessary.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.531
Private likes big.

10:58.406 --> 10:59.742
Oh, boy.
