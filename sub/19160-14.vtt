35:26.830 --> 35:29.120
For anything worth doing,
yes.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.960
And I've climbed
a few of those hills.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.790
The Brandon Bill,
for example.

35:32.790 --> 35:34.790
The Brandon Bill
is a piece of legislation

35:34.790 --> 35:36.420
I'm truly proud of.

35:36.420 --> 35:40.290
But to be honest, Noah,
I could have done more.

35:40.290 --> 35:43.670
I've been the most powerful man
in America,

35:43.670 --> 35:45.880
and yet I have neglected

35:45.880 --> 35:47.540
some of the men and women
of this country

35:47.540 --> 35:49.080
who most needed
their government's help.

35:49.080 --> 35:52.040
Luckily,
I have a few more days,

35:52.040 --> 35:55.330
so I'm kicking off
my final week in office

35:55.330 --> 35:57.500
with a series
of presidential pardons,

35:57.500 --> 35:58.750
and there's one in particular
I'd like to highlight,

35:58.750 --> 36:01.580
where a young man,
Shaun Campbell,

36:01.580 --> 36:04.540
was convicted under
a federal hate crimes statute

36:04.540 --> 36:06.790
for the murder of church-bomber
Robert Edward Barnes.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.960
And let me be clear --

36:08.960 --> 36:13.250
People are going to be upset
about this pardon,

36:13.250 --> 36:17.500
but when I look at
the facts of Shaun's case,

36:17.500 --> 36:19.540
I don't just see
reasonable doubt.

36:19.540 --> 36:21.540
I see probable doubt.

36:21.540 --> 36:22.960
And that is
just not the way

36:22.960 --> 36:25.080
our system
is supposed to work.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.670
So, Shaun Campbell
gets a second chance.

36:27.670 --> 36:29.790
He does.

36:29.790 --> 36:31.620
And hopefully, so do I,

36:31.620 --> 36:34.920
because reviewing these cases

36:34.920 --> 36:38.290
showed me just how many
of this country's young people

36:38.290 --> 36:42.290
are sitting in prison
for want of a fairer trial.

36:42.290 --> 36:43.960
And that's why,

36:43.960 --> 36:46.290
when I leave office
a week from today,

36:46.290 --> 36:48.580
I'll be leaving

36:48.580 --> 36:51.040
