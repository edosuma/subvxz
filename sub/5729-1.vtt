00:45.245 --> 00:47.577
(children) Trick or treat!

00:49.282 --> 00:51.773
(excited chatter)

00:53.887 --> 00:56.321
Trick or treat!

01:33.593 --> 01:35.788
(girl) Hey, wait a minute,
What about this house?

01:35.862 --> 01:38.695
(boy) Forget that house,
Let's go to the next one,

01:38.765 --> 01:40.858
(whispering) Somebody's coming,

01:40.934 --> 01:44.165
Come on, Sophie, You know
nobody ever comes here on Halloween,

01:44.237 --> 01:46.728
But, Mom, it's just a costume party,
You've gotta let me go,

01:46.806 --> 01:49.536
The whole world is going,
If I don't go, I'll be a freak,

01:49.609 --> 01:53.272
You know, the odds were 50%
I'd get one normal sister,

01:53.346 --> 01:56.008
Mom, I'm 13, OK?
I'm practically a grownup,

01:56.082 --> 01:59.677
I'm certainly old enough
to make my own choices, Right?

01:59.752 --> 02:02.721
- Yeah, I guess so,
- Is there an age for that?

02:02.789 --> 02:06.555
Look, Marnie, I am sorry,
but you are not going out on Halloween,

02:06.626 --> 02:07.718
Why?

02:07.794 --> 02:12.959
I have my reasons, and I will explain them
to you when you're,,, taller,

02:13.032 --> 02:16.058
Mom, you've been saying that
for, like, my whole life, OK?

02:16.136 --> 02:19.037
It's just one night,
What is the big deal?

02:19.105 --> 02:20.902
It does seem a little unfair,

02:20.974 --> 02:23.636
I mean, seeing as how Marnie
likes weird stuff so much,

02:23.710 --> 02:28.738
- Yeah, Halloween is, like, made for her,
- Skeletons, witches, vampires,,,

02:28.815 --> 02:31.443
She spends our whole math class
drawing ghosts in her notebook,

02:31.518 --> 02:34.851
- Guys!
- All right, that's all,

02:34.921 --> 02:38.584
Thank you all for coming, You've been
a lovely audience, but the show is over,

02:38.658 --> 02:41.126
Marnie will see you all tomorrow,

02:41.194 --> 02:43.321
- Mom!
- See you later, Marnie,

02:43.396 --> 02:45.626
- Here's your broom,
- We'll bring you some candy,

02:45.698 --> 02:48.599
Your pumpkin, Good night,

02:48.668 --> 02:51.466
I am so sick of this,

02:51.538 --> 02:55.201
I want to know why we can't be
like other kids and go out on Halloween,

02:55.275 --> 02:58.506
My poor little sister
should be out trick-or-treating,

02:58.578 --> 03:01.570
But look at her,
You've kept her from a normal childhood,

03:01.648 --> 03:03.912
and it's turned her into a wall ornament!

03:03.983 --> 03:05.780
I think it's obvious
why Halloween is bad,

03:05.852 --> 03:09.310
That whole razor-blade-in-the-apple thing
was an urban myth, of course,

03:09.389 --> 03:12.654
But then, all that candy
causes cavities and gum disease,

03:12.725 --> 03:15.888
and those masks everybody wears have
these weird kind of toxic fumes inside

03:15.962 --> 03:19.625
that make your arms go limp,
and,,, and,,,

03:19.699 --> 03:21.963
It's totally too late for him,

03:22.035 --> 03:25.266
Marnie, I'm sorry, I know that
you want to go out with your friends,

03:25.338 --> 03:28.739
but there are just some things about
Halloween that you don't understand,

03:28.808 --> 03:34.110
Oh, right, Like there's some big,
mysterious reason why we can't go out,

03:34.180 --> 03:36.808
Face it, Mom,
You don't trust your own kids,

03:36.883 --> 03:39.147
- That is not true,
- Oh, yes, it is,

03:39.219 --> 03:41.585
You keep us all in this big bubble,

03:41.654 --> 03:45.249
How are we supposed to grow up
if we can't explore the world,

03:45.325 --> 03:47.691
try new stuff and take some risks?

03:47.760 --> 03:50.524
Marnie, I am just trying to protect you,

03:50.597 --> 03:55.398
Yeah, you're protecting us from being
anything but a bunch of vegetables,

03:55.468 --> 03:58.562
Hey, look! I'm a potato!
Are you happy now?

03:58.638 --> 04:00.970
Maybe I'll put down
some roots in the carpet,

04:01.040 --> 04:03.440
(mocking) "Oh, no, Marnie,
It's too dangerous,"

04:03.509 --> 04:07.206
"There are things about vegetables
that you don't understand,"

04:10.550 --> 04:12.541
Somebody's coming!

04:15.154 --> 04:19.180
Come, my little wall ornament,
Let's get you washed up for dinner,

04:19.259 --> 04:22.057
- Somebody's coming!
- Come on, sweetie,

04:24.063 --> 04:27.931
Why are you so obsessed with Halloween?
I mean, it's just like Mom says:

04:28.001 --> 04:31.437
It gives little kids dumb ideas
about there being magic,

04:31.504 --> 04:33.404
Like that helps them prepare for life,

04:33.473 --> 04:37.204
Personally, give me
a good nature documentary any day,

04:37.277 --> 04:40.178
Halloween is cool, nature boy,

04:40.246 --> 04:44.012
I mean, it's exciting, strange and ancient,

04:44.083 --> 04:48.076
Plus, Mom and Dad met on Halloween,

04:48.154 --> 04:50.315
Shh! What are you trying to do?

04:50.390 --> 04:53.052
You know how talking about Dad
always bums Mom out,

04:53.126 --> 04:58.223
I mean, why can't you pick some other
holiday to get hung up on, like Arbor Day?

04:58.298 --> 05:01.426
Trees are important too, you know,

05:03.002 --> 05:05.300
(children chattering)

05:07.540 --> 05:10.441
Hey, guys, wait up!
Wait for me!

05:32.899 --> 05:35.595
Oh, come on!

05:37.837 --> 05:39.964
Come on!

05:42.442 --> 05:44.672
Suit yourself,

05:56.923 --> 05:59.255
Oh,,, (chuckles)

06:09.635 --> 06:12.126
No, no, no, no, no, no,

06:12.205 --> 06:16.642
- Come on, Mom, It's just one cookie,
- Not before dinner, Sophie,

06:16.709 --> 06:19.701
Marnie's right,
You never let us do anything fun,

06:19.779 --> 06:23.510
Oh, you can have a cookie after dinner,

06:24.584 --> 06:26.643
I want that cookie,

06:28.588 --> 06:30.852
I really want that cookie,

06:44.370 --> 06:45.701
Not again,

06:50.243 --> 06:54.577
- Are you eating a cookie?
- (muffled) No! Go sit down,

06:54.647 --> 06:57.480
Good thing she doesn't like liver, eh, dear?

06:57.550 --> 06:59.313
- Mother!
- Grandma!

06:59.385 --> 07:02.912
- What are you doing here?
- (both) Grandma!

07:02.989 --> 07:05.981
It's so wonderful to see you
and the children again,

07:06.058 --> 07:10.427
Ooh, my, my, my, my,
How you've grown! Oh!

07:10.496 --> 07:14.398
- Did you bring us presents?
- Oh, presents, presents, presents,

07:14.467 --> 07:19.734
What kind of a grandma do you think I'd be
if I didn't bring you presents?

07:19.806 --> 07:22.775
They're right here in my suitcase, I just,,,

07:22.842 --> 07:25.072
I don't know where that thing went to,
Just a minute,

07:25.144 --> 07:27.044
Ah, there it is!

07:27.113 --> 07:32.847
Where did you get to, my little darling?
Come on, Here it is!

07:32.919 --> 07:35.285
How come you've been gone so long,
Grandma?

07:35.354 --> 07:38.380
Well, you know, one thing and another,

07:40.193 --> 07:43.754
But the important thing
is that I'm here now,

07:43.830 --> 07:48.563
And I'm so glad to see you,,, all,

07:50.036 --> 07:53.904
Come on, come on, come on, Come on!

07:56.142 --> 07:59.441
Hey, Mom, do you think you and Grandma
could, like, not fight for once?

07:59.512 --> 08:01.446
I mean, we haven't seen her
in over a year,

08:01.514 --> 08:03.379
Grandma Aggie's the one
who always starts it,

08:03.449 --> 08:04.746
- Does not,
- Does too,

08:04.817 --> 08:05.841
- Does not,
- Does too,

08:05.918 --> 08:06.680
Does not!

08:07.186 --> 08:09.211
Eureka!

08:09.288 --> 08:11.279
Whoo!

08:11.757 --> 08:13.156
Candy!

08:13.226 --> 08:17.629
- Ooh, that's the spirit,
- Wow,

08:17.697 --> 08:21.258
Put on our bikinis and go swimming in it!

08:21.334 --> 08:27.398
Oh, and then we'll put up the decorations
so we can get this party started!

08:27.473 --> 08:29.839
Look, Grandma dressed up for Halloween!

08:29.909 --> 08:33.241
What? Oh, Oh, yes, of course I did,

08:33.312 --> 08:35.871
I always do!

08:35.948 --> 08:39.076
Oh, here, honey, I want you to go
and hang this on the doorknob,

08:39.150 --> 08:40.618
Ew,

08:41.053 --> 08:44.181
It annoys the vampires,

08:44.256 --> 08:46.157
This bag defies logic,

08:46.225 --> 08:49.661
- How does all this stuff fit in here?
- I don't know,

08:49.729 --> 08:56.134
You know, dear, if I'm not mistaken,
this is Marnie's 13th Halloween,

08:56.202 --> 08:59.399
Mm, a wonderfully lucky number, 13,

08:59.472 --> 09:00.939
Totally,

09:01.007 --> 09:03.999
Yes, I'm well aware
of what number it is, Mother,

09:04.076 --> 09:06.840
- Hey, look, a pentagram!
- Wow!

09:06.913 --> 09:10.474
Lon Chaney had one of these on his palm
when he got bitten by that werewolf,

09:10.550 --> 09:12.643
So he did,

09:12.718 --> 09:16.210
I've always said the movies
can teach us about life,

09:16.289 --> 09:19.417
Mother, as I just got through telling Marnie,
Halloween is not,,,

09:19.492 --> 09:20.720
What else can I do, Grandma?

09:20.793 --> 09:24.320
Well, now, why don't you
put out the pumpkins, you see?

09:24.397 --> 09:28.231
They have such cute little faces,
just like yours!

09:28.301 --> 09:29.563
Neat!

09:29.635 --> 09:32.763
Oh, and I thought you'd appreciate these,

09:33.873 --> 09:36.307
- Hieroglyphics!
- Mother!

09:36.375 --> 09:39.708
You know, these look like the ones
from the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.508
Very good,

09:41.581 --> 09:44.141
I'll bet you get A's in school,

09:44.216 --> 09:48.050
Actually, she gets B's and C's,
I get the A's,

09:48.120 --> 09:50.145
Ow,

09:50.222 --> 09:53.020
You know, Grandma,
this is totally awesome!

09:53.092 --> 09:57.392
I mean, nobody around here
really appreciates my taste in weird stuff,

09:57.463 --> 09:59.590
- Encouragement, not good,
- No,

09:59.665 --> 10:03.624
And you know what else? I have déja vu
a lot, I mean, like, all the time,

10:03.703 --> 10:05.728
Really?

10:05.805 --> 10:07.830
- Well, you know, if you could practice,,,
- Mother!

10:07.907 --> 10:10.603
Could I talk to you in the kitchen
for just one minute?

10:10.676 --> 10:16.012
Absolutely, dear, As soon as I get
the children into their costumes,

10:16.082 --> 10:17.709
Costumes?

10:17.783 --> 10:19.774
- Whoo!
- Wow!

10:19.852 --> 10:23.049
And the ghost! Oh, there!

10:23.122 --> 10:24.953
- What?
- Ooh, ooh!

10:25.024 --> 10:27.618
Yes, now this is the winner,

10:31.163 --> 10:32.892
This is so awesome!

10:32.965 --> 10:34.694
Ah, I'm a wiccan!

10:34.767 --> 10:37.031
I'm a ghost!

10:37.103 --> 10:39.333
I think I'm a big pimple,

10:39.739 --> 10:43.641
All right, that's it, Mother, these children
are not going out trick-or-treating,

10:43.709 --> 10:46.576
and now it is time for dinner,

10:46.646 --> 10:49.240
- But Mom,,,
- No, no, She's right, She's right,

10:49.315 --> 10:52.182
- (whispering) We'll eat the candy later,
- OK,

10:52.251 --> 10:54.276
Come on, here we go, Whoo!

10:55.021 --> 10:57.319
Ooh, Ooh, ooh, ooh!

10:57.390 --> 11:00.223
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

11:00.292 --> 11:02.988
Oh no, dear,
It's more like a moaning sound,

11:03.062 --> 11:08.159
You know, ghosts tend to be very
depressed creatures, anyway, Like this:

11:08.234 --> 11:11.795
(moaning)

11:16.008 --> 11:18.977
Well, Mother,
your visit's been very educational,

11:19.045 --> 11:22.310
- But it's time for bed,
- Oh, Mom!

11:22.381 --> 11:23.780
She's right,

11:23.849 --> 11:28.047
Your mother and I need
to talk about grownup things, anyway,

11:28.120 --> 11:32.079
- Can't you at least tell us a bedtime story?
- Yeah, great idea!

11:32.158 --> 11:35.616
Yeah!
I mean, horrible idea,

11:35.695 --> 11:37.424
- Come on, Mom, please?
- Just one?

11:37.496 --> 11:39.589
- Please, please?
- Please?

11:39.665 --> 11:41.189
Well,,,

11:42.968 --> 11:45.528
- All right, but just one,
- Yes!

11:45.604 --> 11:46.662
Oh, good,

11:47.006 --> 11:49.668
See you upstairs, Grandma,

11:51.110 --> 11:54.602
You guys get ready for bed,
We'll be right up,

11:54.680 --> 11:56.841
Oh, I missed them so,

11:59.151 --> 12:01.585
You know, dear, I've been thinking,

12:01.654 --> 12:03.986
I'd love to have you move back home,
Gwen,

12:04.056 --> 12:06.422
I mean, there's plenty of room
for all of you at my house,

12:06.492 --> 12:07.550
Mother,,,

12:07.626 --> 12:11.118
And since William's passed on,
there's nothing to hold you here,

12:11.197 --> 12:13.961
Nothing has to hold me here, Mother,
I like being here,

12:14.033 --> 12:16.831
I can have a normal life here,
They can have a normal life here,

12:16.902 --> 12:20.133
Oh, being normal is vastly overrated,

12:20.206 --> 12:22.697
Well, I like being normal,

12:24.376 --> 12:28.107
You know, Mother, as much as I want
the kids to know their family,

12:28.180 --> 12:32.116
the fact is,,, you're not normal,

12:32.184 --> 12:33.173
Hm,

12:33.252 --> 12:36.483
Every time you come into this house,
it's-it's chaos,

12:36.555 --> 12:40.286
And the candy and the decorations
and the,,,

12:41.460 --> 12:43.894
(sighs)

12:43.963 --> 12:47.399
Mother, Mom,

12:47.466 --> 12:50.060
Let's not fight again,

12:50.136 --> 12:53.628
I know you're only here
for a couple of hours,

12:53.706 --> 12:55.901
Go and tell them a story,

12:55.975 --> 12:59.536
Talk to them and get to know them,

12:59.612 --> 13:04.379
But on your honor, don't tell them
about home, Your home, I mean,

13:04.450 --> 13:08.113
Oh, don't worry, dear,
I won't tell them a thing,

13:09.221 --> 13:10.586
Thank you,

13:11.490 --> 13:13.048
Ah,,,

13:13.125 --> 13:15.116
Whoo! Boo!

13:15.194 --> 13:16.354
Hi,

13:16.428 --> 13:20.694
Just came by to check that everyone's
got their thermostat set to 68 degrees,

13:20.766 --> 13:23.257
because it's important to conserve energy
during the evening hours,,,

13:23.335 --> 13:25.200
Dylan, just get in here,

13:25.271 --> 13:28.570
Which story are you gonna tell us,
Grandma? Is it one I know?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.700
Oh, no, I wouldn't think so,

13:30.776 --> 13:35.145
My story is about a magical place

13:35.214 --> 13:38.479
where many sorts of different creatures
live together in peace,

13:38.551 --> 13:40.815
Like Cleveland?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.519
I hear they have a nice school district,

13:43.589 --> 13:47.047
Well, actually, the place I'm speaking of
is called Halloweentown,

13:47.126 --> 13:51.222
And the residents are a bit more,,, exotic,

13:51.297 --> 13:56.325
Monsters, goblins, ghosts,
vampires, gnomes and skeletons,

13:56.402 --> 13:58.529
Do they have dybbuks and banshees
there too?

13:58.604 --> 14:03.974
By the dozens,
And of course, a few very fine witches,

14:05.044 --> 14:08.343
I don't like witches,
They're mean and scary,

14:08.414 --> 14:11.008
Oh, no, no, no, sweetheart,

14:11.083 --> 14:14.052
I mean, they're just like everyone else,
Some are kind, some are mean,

14:14.119 --> 14:17.247
That's the way they use their magic,

14:17.323 --> 14:21.054
You can't tell what's in a monster's heart
just by looking at 'em,

14:21.126 --> 14:26.086
I mean, sometimes,
some of the slimiest, raunchiest,

14:26.165 --> 14:29.191
ugliest little monsters
turn out to be the nicest,

14:29.268 --> 14:31.668
- I want to go there!
- Oh,

14:31.737 --> 14:34.706
Excuse me, but we have
an impressionable young child here,

14:34.773 --> 14:39.107
I think we should make it clear that this
place we're talking about is just pretend,

14:39.178 --> 14:40.270
Oh, yes, yes,

14:40.346 --> 14:46.012
Well, actually, I have to confess that I didn't
make it up, I read about it in a book,

14:46.085 --> 14:48.212
So you see, maybe it is real,

14:48.287 --> 14:52.189
- A book? What book?
- Oh,,,

14:52.258 --> 14:55.386
There, Halloweentown.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.588
- Let me see!
- All right,

14:57.663 --> 14:59.597
Look, a ghost,

14:59.665 --> 15:02.930
- Just like we were playing, Grandma,
- Mm,

15:04.503 --> 15:08.963
Oh, look, and there's a werewolf
and a vampire and a gnome,

15:09.041 --> 15:10.702
Dog Man,

15:10.776 --> 15:16.146
Oh, Grandma, this book is so neat,
It has, like, all the stuff I'm interested in,

15:16.215 --> 15:18.911
Great, the weirdo encyclopedia,

15:18.984 --> 15:21.578
Ew, Snot Man,

15:23.322 --> 15:26.257
- Look, it's Marnie!
- Uh-huh,

15:38.103 --> 15:39.400
It is me,

15:42.341 --> 15:45.868
She doesn't look anything like you,
She's way too cute,

15:45.945 --> 15:49.142
Oh, yeah, and this is from a guy
who could win an ugly contest,

15:49.214 --> 15:51.739
Well, there is quite a resemblance,

15:53.285 --> 15:56.846
Perhaps Marnie has a secret life
we don't know anything about,

15:56.922 --> 16:00.619
Well, if she is a witch,
she's got the weird part down pat,

16:00.693 --> 16:04.060
It's just the magic powers she's missing,

16:04.129 --> 16:05.460
What about it, dear?

16:05.531 --> 16:10.969
Have you cast any spells or taken
midnight flights through the sky?

16:11.036 --> 16:13.527
I wish,

16:13.605 --> 16:18.065
But the truth is,,,
there's nothing special about me,

16:18.143 --> 16:21.340
Oh, no, dear, You're very special,
You're a Cromwell!

16:21.413 --> 16:24.211
And since the dawn of time, the Cromwells
have been the most powerful,,,

16:24.283 --> 16:26.274
Mother,

16:27.753 --> 16:31.211
It's getting late, You wouldn't want
to miss your bus back home,

16:31.290 --> 16:33.588
Aw, Grandma has to go?

16:35.227 --> 16:37.752
But can't you stay overnight, Grandma?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.924
Oh, no, dear,
Your mother's quite right,

16:41.000 --> 16:46.028
If I don't head home by midnight, well,
it's just,,, it's a long time until the next bus,

16:46.105 --> 16:49.700
So kiss Grandma good night,
And good night, dear,

16:49.775 --> 16:51.538
Don't let the bogeyman bite!

16:51.610 --> 16:55.102
And I'll be back
to see you all as soon as I can,

16:55.180 --> 16:57.978
That's "lights out," you two,

16:58.484 --> 17:00.577
Mother, I am going to put Dylan to bed,

17:00.652 --> 17:03.246
and then I will meet you
down in the kitchen in one minute,

17:03.322 --> 17:05.586
Of course, dear,

17:05.656 --> 17:08.319
Good night, Grandma,

17:09.560 --> 17:10.686
Bye,

17:47.232 --> 17:51.134
And after I specifically told you
not to tell them anything about it,

17:51.203 --> 17:54.331
I was only trying to do
what you should have done long ago,

17:54.406 --> 17:56.397
Why, you're on the verge
of breaking a tradition

17:56.475 --> 17:58.534
that goes back more than 1,000 years,,,

17:58.610 --> 18:01.101
Your tradition, Mother, Not mine,

18:01.680 --> 18:04.649
Marnie is my daughter, and if I decide
not to train her like a witch,

18:04.716 --> 18:06.513
then it's none of your business,

18:06.585 --> 18:10.180
A witch's 13th Halloween is supposed
to mark the completion of her training,

18:10.255 --> 18:14.954
If Marnie's training doesn't at least begin
tonight, her powers will be lost forever,

18:15.027 --> 18:18.360
(Gwen) Yes! And she'll finally be human!
She'll finally be normal,

18:18.430 --> 18:21.558
like her brother, like her father
and like Sophie will be after her,

18:21.633 --> 18:23.931
(grunts) Gwen, a human father,

18:24.002 --> 18:28.598
Why, you're only lucky that you have two
children that are showing powers at all!

18:28.674 --> 18:32.303
Do you really want them to go through life
doing things the hard way?

18:32.377 --> 18:35.505
I mean, look at you, with your plastic bowls,

18:35.581 --> 18:40.018
when you know leftover chicken
keeps better when it's back on the bone,

18:40.085 --> 18:43.316
Mother, get that thing out of here right now,

18:45.057 --> 18:47.218
(squawks)

18:47.292 --> 18:48.452
(Gwen sighs)

18:49.161 --> 18:52.255
For years, you have been coming here,
You've been dropping hints to Marnie,

18:52.331 --> 18:54.663
and you've been badgering me
to start her training,

18:54.733 --> 18:58.260
I know that that's why you came here
tonight, Mother, But the fight is over,

18:58.337 --> 19:01.431
You know that?
The clock has finally run out,

19:01.507 --> 19:04.476
and you can just go home,

19:05.911 --> 19:10.746
Gwen, as much as I think you're making
a terrible mistake with Marnie,

19:10.816 --> 19:13.114
you're wrong about
why I came here tonight,

19:13.185 --> 19:16.951
The fact is, I came to ask for your help,

19:17.723 --> 19:21.159
My help,
With what?

19:21.994 --> 19:26.931
Well, something is wrong at home,
Something's happening,

19:26.999 --> 19:32.096
Every day, I find another neighbor has
changed, Turned hateful, it's frightening,

19:32.171 --> 19:35.868
And soon after that,
they disappear altogether,

19:35.941 --> 19:39.069
Please, Mother, My neighbors disappear
sometimes too, It's called moving,

19:39.144 --> 19:42.272
Oh, Gwendolyn,
I'm quite serious about this,

19:42.347 --> 19:47.307
It's as though something or someone
is trying to return us to the Dark Times,

19:47.386 --> 19:50.184
And I fear my powers alone
may not be enough to stop it,

19:50.255 --> 19:53.952
I need another Cromwell witch,
I need you,

19:54.026 --> 19:58.019
Mother, there are plenty of other witches
and warlocks in Halloweentown,

19:58.096 --> 19:59.461
Why don't you recruit one of them?

19:59.531 --> 20:06.061
Oh, I've tried, You know how it is today,
No one wants to get involved,

20:06.138 --> 20:10.598
Mother, I'm sure that you believe
that there's some kind of problem,

20:10.676 --> 20:14.908
But I can't just leave my kids to go fight
some nameless force in another world

20:14.980 --> 20:18.245
that I have nothing to do with,

20:18.317 --> 20:20.182
Nothing to do with?

20:20.252 --> 20:21.412
Hm,

20:21.486 --> 20:23.977
Well, fine,

20:24.056 --> 20:29.016
Bury your head in the sand
of the precious Mortal World of yours,

20:29.094 --> 20:31.824
Perhaps the Cromwell line
will end with you,

20:32.231 --> 20:37.669
But let's just hope that Halloweentown
doesn't come to an end along with it,

20:42.441 --> 20:44.466
Enjoy your leftovers, dear,

20:44.543 --> 20:45.532
(squawks)

20:45.611 --> 20:47.272
(chickens squawking)

20:47.346 --> 20:49.473
(sighs)

20:49.548 --> 20:51.880
Mother,

20:51.950 --> 20:54.976
Then she talked about all this weird stuff
that's happening in Halloweentown,

20:55.053 --> 20:57.453
like it's a real place,
And then she turned our leftovers

20:57.522 --> 20:59.649
into a live chicken,
standing right there in the bowl,

20:59.725 --> 21:03.684
And that's why I knew that she is a witch,
and so is Mom and so am I!

21:03.762 --> 21:06.128
Because they both said so,
What do you think?

21:06.198 --> 21:11.158
I think it proves insanity is hereditary,
I just hope boys are immune,

21:11.236 --> 21:14.262
(door closing)

21:20.579 --> 21:23.980
It must be, um, one of those
radio-controlled models,

21:24.049 --> 21:28.452
She's leaving, She's going back
to Halloweentown, I gotta go after her,

21:28.520 --> 21:30.715
Go after her?
Are you crazy?

21:30.789 --> 21:34.589
I have to go, If she doesn't start
training me as a witch tonight,

21:34.660 --> 21:36.321
I could lose my powers forever,

21:36.395 --> 21:39.387
You don't really believe
all this witch stuff is true, do ya?

21:39.464 --> 21:42.797
Dylan, haven't you ever wondered
about the stuff that goes on in our house?

21:42.868 --> 21:43.857
No,

21:43.935 --> 21:46.870
Like why Mom won't let us
talk about, watch or read

21:46.938 --> 21:49.668
anything that has the word "magic" in it?

21:49.741 --> 21:51.265
No,

21:51.343 --> 21:54.676
Haven't you ever wondered
why we pretend Halloween doesn't exist?

21:54.746 --> 21:57.044
Or why I have déja vu all the time?

21:57.115 --> 22:00.278
Or why stuff seems to fall off the shelves
whenever Sophie has a tantrum?

22:00.352 --> 22:02.286
- No,
- Well, I have,

22:02.354 --> 22:03.878
And now that I've found out the truth,

22:03.955 --> 22:06.480
I'm not gonna stay here
and turn all boring and human like you,

22:06.558 --> 22:08.549
What do you mean, boring like me?

22:08.627 --> 22:12.063
(man on TV) Tired of that dank,
musty odor in your cellar?

22:12.130 --> 22:14.155
Try the new Spore Buster Deluxe.

22:14.232 --> 22:17.998
It removes mold and fungus
just like magic.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.197
No, it doesn't,

22:20.272 --> 22:23.435
(woman) The house doesn't smell
like mushroom omelets anymore!

22:23.508 --> 22:25.703
(man) Thanks, Spore Buster!

22:30.182 --> 22:31.945
Marnie, wait up!

22:32.017 --> 22:34.645
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the man of the house,

22:34.720 --> 22:37.655
I gotta keep an eye on you, Plus, I'm gonna
have a hard time getting back to sleep

22:37.723 --> 22:39.657
till I find out if you're crazy or not,

22:39.725 --> 22:43.491
Then help me find her,
She's gotta be around here somewhere,

22:43.562 --> 22:45.189
There she is,

22:46.231 --> 22:48.131
Get down,

22:48.200 --> 22:51.692
- Where'd that bus stop come from?
- I don't know, Can I put my shoe on now?

22:51.770 --> 22:55.228
- I'm having the déja vu feeling again,
- You knew I was gonna put on my shoe?

22:55.307 --> 22:58.868
No! This whole thing -
the bus stop, Grandma,

22:58.944 --> 23:01.879
Wait, Maybe it's not déja vu at all,

23:01.947 --> 23:04.711
Maybe I'm seeing the future,

23:04.783 --> 23:07.047
Right, Now you can see the future,

23:07.119 --> 23:09.883
Tell me, what am I
gonna have for breakfast?

23:09.955 --> 23:12.446
- Why are you such a downer?
- Why are you such a nutcase?

23:12.524 --> 23:13.616
- Downer,
- Nutcase,

23:13.692 --> 23:16.559
- Dow,,,
- (bell ringing)

23:19.464 --> 23:23.798
- Where'd that bus come from?
- I don't know, but I'm not missing it,

23:24.503 --> 23:26.971
- Hi, Skinner,
- (man) Hello, Aggie,

23:34.980 --> 23:37.107
Ah, made it,

23:42.254 --> 23:44.381
Why don't we go sit up front
with Grandma?

23:44.456 --> 23:49.689
No, not yet, I don't want to take a chance
of her stopping the bus to send us home,

23:49.761 --> 23:51.353
(loud rumbling)

23:51.430 --> 23:53.091
What?

23:55.167 --> 23:57.567
Stopping the bus where?

23:57.636 --> 24:01.595
(man) So anyway, there I was,
trying to spook this fellow,

24:01.673 --> 24:06.440
He was buying nachos at the minimart
when this smart-aleck child

24:06.511 --> 24:11.448
with a dreadful little monster mask
runs up to me and yells, "Daddy!"

24:11.516 --> 24:14.815
Ooh, I ask you, where is the respect?

24:14.886 --> 24:19.914
It's not like the old days, People are jaded,
I raise a demon from the underworld,

24:19.991 --> 24:23.017
and they say, "Big deal,
I saw the same thing on Jerry Springer."

24:23.094 --> 24:25.289
(laughter)

24:25.363 --> 24:29.459
I've always loved a good scare
for old time's sake,

24:29.534 --> 24:32.469
Must be, you know,
one of those charter buses

24:32.537 --> 24:36.268
coming back from a costume party
at the Moose Lodge, Or maybe,,, Oh!

24:43.248 --> 24:45.478
(whistle blowing)

24:46.184 --> 24:48.152
(bell ringing)

24:52.491 --> 24:55.324
(man) Hey, good to see you!

24:55.393 --> 24:59.329
- We're here,
- Yeah, but where's "here"?

25:07.305 --> 25:09.136
- Oh, oh!
- I'm very sorry,

25:09.207 --> 25:10.936
Aggie! How are you, dear?

25:11.009 --> 25:12.977
Oh, Harriet, I'm fine,

25:13.044 --> 25:16.946
Been to visit the mortals, eh?
Didn't have time this year myself,

25:17.015 --> 25:20.041
Doing some volunteer work
down at the headless shelter,

25:20.118 --> 25:23.212
- Poor dears, Care for a muffin?
- No,

25:23.288 --> 25:27.554
I baked them for the folks at the shelter,
Didn't occur to me they couldn't eat them,

25:27.626 --> 25:29.651
No heads!

25:29.728 --> 25:32.629
Oh, well, Must be off, Take care,

25:32.697 --> 25:34.722
Bye, Harriet,

25:50.582 --> 25:52.709
- Wow,
- Whoa,

25:54.252 --> 25:56.720
I don't get it,
Monsters are just pretend,

25:56.788 --> 26:00.280
- Dylan, this is it,
- Mom said they were just pretend,

26:00.358 --> 26:03.452
Dylan, this is Halloweentown,
just like the book,

26:03.528 --> 26:07.555
Or maybe we fell asleep on the bus,
Yeah, that's it, It's all a dream,

26:07.632 --> 26:10.999
The decorations, the goblins,
the witches, the ghosts,,,

26:11.069 --> 26:12.934
And Grandma - she was a dream, too,

26:13.004 --> 26:16.963
Oh, no - Grandma,
Where'd she go?

26:18.009 --> 26:21.274
She's gotta be around here somewhere,

26:21.346 --> 26:24.747
We've got to find her,
What are you doing? We're gonna lose,,,

26:26.985 --> 26:29.977
Sophie! How did you get here?

26:30.055 --> 26:32.319
- Careful, she could be a mirage,
- Would you stop?

26:32.390 --> 26:35.223
- How did you get here?
- I followed you onto the bus,

26:35.293 --> 26:38.854
- But you were asleep,
- I was pretending,

26:39.631 --> 26:41.656
See? You're a bad influence,

26:41.733 --> 26:46.432
The pumpkin doesn't look very nice
like in the book,

26:46.504 --> 26:49.530
You're right,
It is different,

26:49.608 --> 26:52.509
- It's the bad thing,
- How do you know about that?

26:52.577 --> 26:54.738
What bad thing?

26:55.847 --> 26:59.146
Well, hello there,
I don't believe we've met,

26:59.217 --> 27:02.550
And that means I'm in trouble, 'cause
the mayor's supposed to know everybody,

27:02.621 --> 27:05.089
I'm Sophie,

27:05.156 --> 27:07.283
- Pardon?
- Sophie,

27:07.359 --> 27:09.884
- What?
- Sophie!

27:09.961 --> 27:12.657
I can't hear ya,
I seem to have a,,,

27:13.932 --> 27:16.332
huge lollypop in my ear,

27:17.335 --> 27:20.395
- There you are, Soapy,
- No, thanks,

27:20.472 --> 27:22.599
OK,

27:27.278 --> 27:30.145
- Neat trick, I'm Marnie,
- Well,

27:31.182 --> 27:36.620
Hello, Marnie, And that wasn't a trick,
I'm a warlock in my off hours,

27:37.822 --> 27:40.689
And you are,,,?

27:40.759 --> 27:42.351
Human,

27:42.427 --> 27:44.361
This is my brother, Dylan,

27:44.429 --> 27:46.727
We're Aggie Cromwell's grandkids,

27:46.798 --> 27:50.666
Wait a minute, Does that mean,,,?
Are you Gwen's kids?

27:50.735 --> 27:52.828
You know our mom?

27:52.904 --> 27:56.863
Well, I did a long time ago,

27:56.941 --> 27:58.966
Is she here with you?

27:59.044 --> 28:02.741
Um,,, No, but that's OK,
See, we came with our grandma,

28:02.814 --> 28:06.011
We kind of lost her in the crowd getting
off the bus, Do you know where she lives?

28:06.084 --> 28:09.884
Oh, of course, She's lived
in the same house for 200 years,

28:09.954 --> 28:11.854
I'll get Benny to run you up there,

28:11.923 --> 28:13.151
(whistles)

28:13.224 --> 28:15.283
(tires screeching)

28:20.699 --> 28:22.223
Come on,

28:22.300 --> 28:25.235
We really appreciate you doing this for us,

28:27.439 --> 28:30.499
Howdy, Mayor, What's the rush?
I'm on my lunch hour,

28:30.575 --> 28:33.942
Filet-O-Fish, Ha!
Just kiddin', What's the ticket?

28:34.012 --> 28:36.742
Well, I found a bunch of Cromwells
in the town square,

28:36.815 --> 28:39.045
Need you to give them a lift
up to their grandma's place,

28:39.117 --> 28:42.416
Sure, it's just over the river
and through the woods, Ha!

28:42.487 --> 28:45.718
No, actually, it's just two streets over, up
a quarter mile past the old movie theater,

28:45.790 --> 28:48.987
Say hi to Aggie for me and,,,
There you go,

28:50.762 --> 28:52.787
He's a much better driver
than he is a comedian,

28:52.864 --> 28:55.799
- Hey!
- Thanks for you help,

28:55.867 --> 28:59.997
- So long, Soapy,
- (Sophie) Sophie!

29:13.585 --> 29:15.485
(whispering) It's not polite to stare,

29:15.553 --> 29:19.922
Polite? Let's talk about how legal it is
to drive with no eyeballs!

29:19.991 --> 29:23.017
So, first time in town for you kids?

29:23.094 --> 29:27.326
Yeah, we just got here on the bus,
It's so amazing,

29:27.398 --> 29:29.866
Yeah, it's a pretty nice place,

29:29.934 --> 29:32.801
Better than a lot of graveyards
I've hung out in,

29:32.871 --> 29:36.637
But that don't mean you kids can go
running around here by yourselves,

29:36.708 --> 29:38.403
Why not?

29:38.476 --> 29:44.005
Well, let's just say that there are characters
around here that ain't the most savory,

29:44.082 --> 29:46.573
Like that kid - Luke,

29:47.886 --> 29:52.619
- Who is he?
- Ah, he's just a local punk,

29:52.690 --> 29:56.683
Thinks he's a big shot just because he got
a nose job and had a few warts removed,

29:56.761 --> 29:59.992
Claims some shadow creature
gave it to him, Ha!

30:04.369 --> 30:08.635
Well, here we are - chez Cromwell,

30:08.706 --> 30:10.731
Cool!

30:12.944 --> 30:15.970
Uh, thanks for the ride,
Do you take dollars?

30:16.047 --> 30:19.881
Ah, don't worry about it,
Catch me in the next life, Ha!

30:19.951 --> 30:21.179
Thanks,

30:24.389 --> 30:27.415
- See ya, kids,
- Bye,

30:27.492 --> 30:30.689
He's probably animatronic,
Disneyland's full of stuff like that,

30:30.762 --> 30:34.095
Yeah, when Mr., Lincoln
drives me to the store, we'll talk,

30:36.301 --> 30:39.168
- Well, it's locked, Better head home,
- No way,

30:39.237 --> 30:43.139
This is the perfect chance
for me to try my powers,

30:44.008 --> 30:46.476
Powers? What powers?

30:46.544 --> 30:50.344
Well, I don't know,
I haven't tried them yet,

30:50.415 --> 30:53.316
Uh, abracadabra,

30:55.920 --> 30:57.478
Open sesame?

31:00.859 --> 31:04.056
Uh, let's see,

31:04.128 --> 31:09.464
Big iron lock that keeps us out,
open up your big iron mouth!

31:09.534 --> 31:10.967
You call that a spell?

31:11.035 --> 31:14.266
- "Out" and "mouth" don't even rhyme!
- Will you be quiet?

31:14.339 --> 31:17.433
You couldn't open a can of dog food
with a spell like that!

31:17.508 --> 31:21.638
Look, I'm trying to concentrate here,

31:23.281 --> 31:26.307
- Sophie, how did you do that?
- I pushed,

31:26.985 --> 31:30.853
Plus, I wished the lock
would turn into a frog,

31:33.591 --> 31:36.025
(croaking)

31:42.901 --> 31:44.596
Ooh!

31:44.669 --> 31:48.332
Well, this should do it,

31:49.207 --> 31:51.767
Mm-mm,

31:56.014 --> 32:00.110
There, "Hubble bubble, toil and trouble,"

32:02.120 --> 32:04.179
Somebody's coming,

32:06.591 --> 32:10.357
- This place is awesome,
- There she is! Hi, Grandma!

32:10.428 --> 32:14.364
- Oh, my stars! How did you get here?
- On the bus,

32:14.432 --> 32:16.195
I came to start my training, Grandma,

32:16.267 --> 32:20.226
Your train,,,?
Oh, it was you outside the kitchen,

32:20.305 --> 32:23.433
I thought I heard someone listening,

32:23.508 --> 32:28.741
Well, I suppose I can assume
your mother doesn't know you're here,

32:28.813 --> 32:33.910
I dare say that she's going to be very upset
when she finds you're gone,

32:33.985 --> 32:36.579
- Can't we just call her?
- No, no, dear,

32:36.654 --> 32:41.148
I'm afraid we haven't worked out
long-distance calling between worlds yet,

32:41.225 --> 32:44.456
No, I'll have to take you home myself,

32:44.529 --> 32:46.520
But you can't take us home!

32:46.597 --> 32:48.997
Yeah, We want to help you
fight the bad thing!

32:49.067 --> 32:52.696
Yeah, the bad thing or the force field,
Whatever it is,

32:52.770 --> 32:55.466
You said you needed
another Cromwell witch,

32:55.540 --> 32:58.703
That could be me,
You can train me!

32:58.776 --> 33:02.473
Yeah, well, I suppose it would be all right
if you could stay a little while,

33:02.547 --> 33:05.914
As long as we get you home
before it's midnight in the Mortal World,

33:05.984 --> 33:08.111
But that's only two hours from now,

33:08.186 --> 33:13.123
Well, don't panic, dear, You see,
time works differently in Halloweentown,

33:13.191 --> 33:17.890
Two hours there might be two days here,
or two weeks, if we're on vacation,

33:17.962 --> 33:22.922
- What's this, Grandma?
- Ah, you've discovered the witches' glass,

33:23.001 --> 33:28.268
It's been handed down through
the Cromwell clan over many generations,

33:28.339 --> 33:31.638
I've been using it to keep my eye on things,

33:35.213 --> 33:39.172
Now the glass shows me that some evil
force is at work here in Halloweentown,

33:39.250 --> 33:41.684
(evil laughter)

33:43.321 --> 33:47.189
Also, the worst is yet to come,

33:48.526 --> 33:50.687
(evil laughter)

33:50.762 --> 33:52.992
What can we do to stop it?

33:54.098 --> 33:56.566
I'll show you,

34:01.739 --> 34:04.037
(sighs)

34:04.776 --> 34:06.835
Follow me,

34:08.079 --> 34:13.540
Merlin himself used this talisman to end
the Dark Ages over in the Mortal World,

34:13.618 --> 34:19.523
and I think it's just the thing to tackle
our troubles here in Halloweentown,

34:19.590 --> 34:21.353
(beeping)

34:21.426 --> 34:24.054
Ooh! Hm,

34:25.228 --> 34:28.596
Are you cookin' chowder, Grandma?
I like chowder,

34:28.666 --> 34:31.157
Oh, no, dear,
This is witches' brew,

34:31.235 --> 34:34.830
It's a little recipe that I picked up
in the sixth century,

34:34.906 --> 34:38.170
- Around King Arthur's time,
- King Arthur?!

34:38.242 --> 34:40.733
How's this stuff gonna help?

34:40.812 --> 34:42.404
Oh,

34:42.480 --> 34:46.712
By bringing this talisman back to life,

34:46.784 --> 34:48.081
Pretty!

34:48.152 --> 34:50.916
Are you gonna use your magic
to raise some spirits,

34:50.987 --> 34:54.583
have a big séance and call on
the forces of darkness to get it going?

34:54.659 --> 34:59.756
No, I'm just gonna fill it up
and see if the light goes on,

34:59.831 --> 35:01.196
Ooh,

35:01.265 --> 35:04.234
If I can get it lit and install it properly,

35:04.302 --> 35:09.035
it should suffice to drive away this force
that threatens us,

35:09.107 --> 35:12.201
That's it?
You just fill it up?

35:12.276 --> 35:14.938
I do have to say a spell over it,

35:15.012 --> 35:18.140
That's why I came -
to ask your mother to help me,

35:18.216 --> 35:23.552
You see, spells are much more powerful
when more than one witch joins in,

35:23.621 --> 35:26.715
- Especially if they're Cromwells,
- Well, I'll help you,

35:26.791 --> 35:30.386
Oh, that's very sweet of you, dear,
but you haven't been trained yet,

35:30.461 --> 35:33.521
And since your mother
isn't of the mind to help,

35:33.598 --> 35:38.695
I guess I'm just on my own,

35:38.769 --> 35:42.330
(moaning)

35:46.811 --> 35:53.649
Bet y March, bet y Guythur,
bet y Gugaun, Cledyfrutm anoeth bid!

35:59.490 --> 36:01.424
Ha,

36:01.492 --> 36:04.723
Oh, drat,

36:04.795 --> 36:08.322
That's what I get for trying to use instant,

36:08.399 --> 36:10.890
Mm, (sighs)

36:10.968 --> 36:14.768
Just doesn't work like it does
when you make it from scratch,

36:14.839 --> 36:17.774
Well, that's something I can help you with!
I can cook!

36:17.842 --> 36:19.776
If you count pouring cereal, Ow!

36:19.844 --> 36:24.440
Well, let's look at the original recipe,
Come, come, Come over here,

36:24.515 --> 36:28.508
Now, let's look, Let's all look, Quick,
Now see,,, That's it!

36:28.586 --> 36:32.716
"Vampire's fang, hair of a werewolf,
sweat of a ghost,,,"

36:32.790 --> 36:35.520
I suppose we could get
these ingredients in town,

36:35.593 --> 36:39.290
But we have to be careful
not to reveal our true purpose,

36:39.363 --> 36:42.332
I can't be certain who to trust anymore,

36:42.400 --> 36:44.163
- Let's do it!
- Yeah!

36:44.235 --> 36:45.463
Oh!

36:49.307 --> 36:50.831
- All right,
- Yes!

36:50.908 --> 36:53.809
Then it's settled, Oh!

36:56.113 --> 36:58.809
(man on TV) Are you fighting
a losing battle with hair loss?

36:58.883 --> 37:02.182
Is hair growing everywhere
but where you need it?

37:02.253 --> 37:05.484
Stop losing, stop thinning, start winning

37:05.556 --> 37:09.686
with our special formula
for hair replacement. Works like magic.

37:09.760 --> 37:13.719
Now that works just like magic,

37:20.705 --> 37:22.605
Dylan?

37:23.908 --> 37:27.173
Marnie, Sophie?!

37:28.279 --> 37:29.610
Mother!

37:31.215 --> 37:33.376
- Nice to see you,
- Hello, Joe,

37:36.287 --> 37:40.849
Is there gonna be a Halloween party today,
Grandma? Everybody's all dressed up,

37:40.925 --> 37:43.621
Well, this is the way we always dress, dear,

37:43.694 --> 37:48.563
The people who started your Halloween
just imitated our traditions,

37:48.633 --> 37:51.761
Mortals see, mortals do,

37:51.836 --> 37:54.600
That's the way your mother
ran into your father -

37:54.672 --> 37:57.402
by crashing a Halloween party!

37:57.475 --> 38:00.842
He loved her witch's costume,

38:00.911 --> 38:02.902
- Hello, Aggie,
- Hello, Sadie,

38:02.980 --> 38:04.174
(Dylan humming)

38:04.248 --> 38:07.240
What are you so happy about?
I thought you didn't want to come,

38:07.318 --> 38:10.412
I decided this really is a dream,
so why worry?

38:10.488 --> 38:14.618
I like Halloweentown, But why do you
have to live so far away, Grandma?

38:14.692 --> 38:20.562
Well, there was a time when humans
and monsters and witches and vampires

38:20.631 --> 38:23.225
and all the rest of us could be together,

38:23.301 --> 38:25.462
It was the Dark Times,

38:25.536 --> 38:30.599
That was a bad mix, because humans
feared us and tried to destroy us,

38:30.675 --> 38:33.872
So we did our best
to make them miserable in return,

38:33.944 --> 38:36.777
But it was turning us evil, which we are not!

38:36.847 --> 38:41.409
So, we decided to create our own world,

38:41.485 --> 38:44.420
Oh, kind of like when Marnie and I
got separate rooms,

38:44.488 --> 38:47.582
Precisely, From that day on,
we were able to settle down

38:47.658 --> 38:50.126
and have homes
and children and jobs,

38:50.194 --> 38:54.028
And an excellent bowling league,

38:58.569 --> 39:02.630
We get really good movies,
like It's a Wonderful Death.

39:02.707 --> 39:05.107
Oh, it's closed!

39:05.176 --> 39:08.043
(screeching)

39:09.680 --> 39:11.875
Harriet,

39:12.350 --> 39:15.547
The mayor,,,
Oh, children,

39:15.920 --> 39:18.787
- Here you are,
- Thank you,

39:18.856 --> 39:21.120
Mayor,

39:21.192 --> 39:23.353
Calabar, could I speak to you
for a moment?

39:23.427 --> 39:27.124
- Of course, Well, hello again, Soapy!
- (together) Sophie!

39:27.198 --> 39:31.100
Sophie, You know,
I think I have an extra sundae,,, oh!

39:31.168 --> 39:33.227
Ahh, Ha-ha!

39:33.304 --> 39:34.328
- Calabar,
- Yes,

39:34.405 --> 39:38.136
I just ran into Harriet,
and she's completely changed!

39:38.209 --> 39:42.839
Her face,,, She was like a wild animal,
And she was fine a couple of hours ago,

39:42.913 --> 39:46.212
- Really?
- This is what I've been telling you about,

39:46.283 --> 39:51.414
If she's like the others, then by tomorrow
she'll have disappeared altogether,

39:53.758 --> 39:55.919
I have to apologize to you, Aggie,

39:55.993 --> 39:58.484
I didn't take you seriously
about this thing at first,

39:58.562 --> 40:01.531
I think you've uncovered
something very serious,

40:01.899 --> 40:04.026
What is it?
What's wrong?

40:04.101 --> 40:07.935
Well, I don't have all the details yet,
but I do know one thing -

40:08.005 --> 40:13.068
I want you to leave this alone for now,
Especially with the children,

40:13.144 --> 40:15.738
It's much too dangerous for you
to be involved with by yourself,

40:15.813 --> 40:17.804
Oh!

40:17.882 --> 40:20.043
Promise me that?

40:21.719 --> 40:23.516
You Cromwells are impossible,

40:23.587 --> 40:25.578
Just give me two days,

40:30.060 --> 40:32.620
Just two days, that's all,

40:35.466 --> 40:36.899
Mm,

40:37.501 --> 40:39.992
Come along, children,
but let's be real careful,

40:40.070 --> 40:42.197
And Marnie, not a wor,,,

40:42.273 --> 40:45.606
Oh, Marnie!
She's found the brooms,

40:45.676 --> 40:49.373
Cool, Flying brooms, Wow,

40:51.182 --> 40:53.173
Well, Marnie,

40:53.250 --> 40:55.718
Oh, Grandma, look at these things!

40:55.786 --> 40:59.483
Yes, they are a bit more snazzier
than when I was a girl,

40:59.557 --> 41:01.752
Can I get one, please?
Please, Grandma? Please?

41:01.826 --> 41:04.761
Yes, well, it is the rite of passage
for witches your age,

41:04.829 --> 41:05.887
Yes!

41:05.963 --> 41:11.196
Well, it looks like you got your eye
on our WindSweeper 5000,

41:11.268 --> 41:14.897
- Is that a good one?
- Well, let's see here,

41:14.972 --> 41:18.032
Unibody construction, Whoo!

41:18.108 --> 41:21.805
Chrome detailing,
A microchip directional system,

41:21.879 --> 41:26.145
Well, it's the top of the line!
If you think you can handle it,

41:26.217 --> 41:29.914
Oh, handle it, This is a Cromwell
you're talking to, dear,

41:29.987 --> 41:32.421
She'll be an expert in no time,

41:32.490 --> 41:34.424
Check it out,

41:34.492 --> 41:36.926
Well, um, how do you make it go?

41:37.661 --> 41:40.391
Oh, you know, by magic,

41:40.464 --> 41:42.659
Oh, right,
I knew that,

41:42.733 --> 41:46.999
How sweet, Buying little Marlie here
her first broom, huh?

41:47.071 --> 41:48.868
It's Marnie,

41:48.939 --> 41:51.999
This is a local boy, Luke,

41:52.076 --> 41:54.544
Hey, don't sell me
too short there, Grammy,

41:54.612 --> 41:57.080
I'm something of a big cheese around here,

41:57.147 --> 42:00.241
Maybe I could show you around sometime,
Buy you an ice cream,

42:00.317 --> 42:03.411
The Abominable Snowman
has a little shop down the street,

42:03.487 --> 42:06.422
You know, I was kind of hungry,

42:06.490 --> 42:09.459
but then,,, I smelled something stinky,

42:09.860 --> 42:12.488
It must have been the big cheese,

42:12.563 --> 42:14.793
Perhaps another time,

42:14.865 --> 42:16.833
Yeah, like never,

42:18.269 --> 42:22.365
You know, if you people were smart,
you'd be nice to me,

42:22.439 --> 42:26.341
I'm friends with some very powerful
creatures around here, you know,,,

42:31.549 --> 42:36.316
Oh, that Luke dude -
he's turned into such a wiener,

42:36.854 --> 42:41.587
All right, now,
If you want to be totally rad,,,

42:41.659 --> 42:44.719
you've got to have the Day-Glo bristles,

42:44.795 --> 42:47.764
Now, the Purple Dragonfly here -
it's awesome,

42:47.831 --> 42:50.925
But I prefer the metallic blue myself,

42:51.569 --> 42:55.437
Uh, this one, It's perfect,
Can I get it, Grandma? Please?

42:55.506 --> 42:58.532
Well, you want me to wrap that up for you?

42:58.609 --> 43:02.602
No! We'll fly it out,

43:04.448 --> 43:06.575
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

43:10.120 --> 43:11.553
Whoo!

43:11.622 --> 43:13.647
(laughter)

43:13.724 --> 43:14.713
Whoa!

43:14.792 --> 43:17.989
Grandma, this is so totally cool,

43:18.062 --> 43:22.260
Well, there's a reason
why witches don't drive minivans!

43:22.333 --> 43:26.133
- Well, how does magic make it go?
- Magic is really very simple,

43:26.203 --> 43:30.367
All you have to do is want something,
and then let yourself have it!

43:30.441 --> 43:33.171
Hang on tight,
Let's see what this can do,

43:33.243 --> 43:36.212
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

43:37.281 --> 43:39.181
Yee-hoo!

43:40.951 --> 43:44.216
- What a witch's life it is,
- Yeah!

43:47.691 --> 43:49.090
Hi, guys,

43:49.159 --> 43:51.059
Whoa, Whoo!

43:51.128 --> 43:54.996
- Watch that curb,
- Yay, Grandma, Me next, me next,

43:55.065 --> 43:58.592
- You next, you next,
- I don't think so,

43:59.970 --> 44:01.267
Mommy!

44:01.338 --> 44:03.829
Oh, I'm sorry if we worried you, dear,

44:03.907 --> 44:06.808
I was gonna get them back
just as soon as I possibly felt that I could,,,

44:06.877 --> 44:10.074
Mother, I cannot believe that you
brought them here in the first place,

44:10.147 --> 44:13.207
But I didn't,
They came to see me,

44:13.283 --> 44:15.717
I wanted to help Grandma
fight the bad thing,

44:15.786 --> 44:19.278
- And I came to get my training,
- Training?

44:19.356 --> 44:22.382
And I tried to stop 'em, Mom,
but they hypnotized me,

44:22.459 --> 44:24.859
- And I thought you were brave,
- Hey, this is Mom,

44:24.928 --> 44:27.556
Stop it,
I don't want to hear any more excuses,

44:27.631 --> 44:30.964
I want you all just to get back on that bus,
because we are going home,

44:31.035 --> 44:33.765
But, Mom, Grandma needs help,

44:33.837 --> 44:39.901
And since you won't help her, she needs
the only other Cromwell witch there is - me,

44:39.977 --> 44:43.913
- You are not a witch,
- Oh, yes, I am, no thanks to you,

44:43.981 --> 44:46.245
You were gonna let my powers
go away forever,

44:46.316 --> 44:49.308
Marnie, there is so much more
involved in this than you understand,

44:49.386 --> 44:53.345
I understand that I am here,
And I've got a broom,

44:53.424 --> 44:56.393
and I'm gonna learn everything
that Grandma can teach me,

44:57.327 --> 45:00.490
- You will not!
- It's her birthright!

45:00.564 --> 45:04.295
She was born in the human world
and human is what she'll be,

45:04.368 --> 45:06.302
No, I won't,

45:06.370 --> 45:10.864
You put that broom down right now,
young lady, You are grounded,

45:17.247 --> 45:21.479
Say goodbye to Grandma, everybody,
It's time for us to go home,

45:22.119 --> 45:23.746
(sighs)

45:23.821 --> 45:26.483
Bye, Grandma,

45:26.557 --> 45:28.149
- Come on,
- Bye,

45:31.862 --> 45:33.921
Marnie?

45:36.467 --> 45:38.401
Thanks, Grandma,

45:38.469 --> 45:40.664
It was a great ride,

45:43.574 --> 45:45.474
Come here, sweetie,

46:02.059 --> 46:04.550
- There's nothing wrong with my tie!
- Look at it,,,

46:04.628 --> 46:06.823
I can't look at it without taking my head off!

46:06.897 --> 46:10.025
I'm never talking to you again, you know,

46:10.100 --> 46:11.192
Excuse me,

46:11.268 --> 46:13.862
I'm so sick of you drinking all this caffeine,
You're giving me a headache,

46:13.937 --> 46:17.429
- Excuse me,
- It's upsetting my stomach, I'm tired of this,

46:17.508 --> 46:21.342
- You don't even know which hand,,, Ow!
- Excuse me, Excuse me,

46:21.411 --> 46:23.140
- (both) What?!
- Excuse me,

46:23.213 --> 46:26.114
Will you please tell me what time
the next bus leaves to the Mortal World?

46:26.183 --> 46:27.411
- The bus?
- Which bus?

46:27.484 --> 46:29.384
- Mortal World?
- Isn't that the number six?

46:29.453 --> 46:32.547
- That's the only one we've got,
- Hey, hey, That's my espresso,

46:32.623 --> 46:35.490
- No, no, Hey,,,
- And I'm never going to school again!

46:35.559 --> 46:39.427
And I'm gonna move someplace
really far away and join a motorcycle gang,

46:39.496 --> 46:42.431
Marnie, this is not our world,
Now drop it,

46:42.499 --> 46:44.057
(men arguing)

46:44.134 --> 46:46.568
- Excuse me,
- I'm on break!

46:46.637 --> 46:50.368
Well, it used to be your world,
Are you gonna get tired of us too?

46:50.440 --> 46:52.806
"Oh, sorry, Those aren't my kids,"

46:52.876 --> 46:55.743
"They used to be my kids,
but I've moved on,"

46:55.813 --> 46:57.576
- Marnie, not now,
- You have the schedule,

46:57.648 --> 46:59.843
I don't have the schedule, Why do I
have to do everything around here?

46:59.917 --> 47:04.752
- Excuse me, What about the bus?
- (overlapping) it’ll be several hours,

47:04.822 --> 47:07.382
- Engine trouble, Yeah, that's it,
- Scheduling problems,

47:07.457 --> 47:09.789
it’ll be fine,
Don't worry about a thing,

47:09.860 --> 47:12.761
Well, what do you know?
The bus isn't running!

47:12.830 --> 47:16.288
- I guess we can't leave after all,
- Yay!

47:16.366 --> 47:19.233
- What time is it?
- There must be some way,

47:19.303 --> 47:21.794
Hey, the mayor seems like a nice guy,
Maybe he would know,

47:21.872 --> 47:23.066
- Dylan!
- Ow,

47:23.140 --> 47:26.007
That's a very good idea,
Let's go,

47:26.076 --> 47:29.603
I don't care if the bus is coming,
That's not our job, My job is to sell tickets,

47:29.680 --> 47:32.114
What do you know about it?
There you go with the caffeine again!

47:32.182 --> 47:33.809
- What's wrong with the caffeine?
- You're killing me!

47:33.884 --> 47:36.819
(bell tolling)

47:43.260 --> 47:45.694
(cawing)

48:00.377 --> 48:03.312
Someone here to see ya, boss,

48:05.082 --> 48:06.845
(wolf whistle)

48:07.584 --> 48:08.812
Gah!

48:10.053 --> 48:12.112
Gwen!

48:12.189 --> 48:14.589
Calabar!

48:14.658 --> 48:17.149
You're the mayor?

48:17.227 --> 48:18.694
(Gwen laughs)

48:18.762 --> 48:20.889
Well, I'm,,, Yes,

48:20.964 --> 48:23.262
- You didn't hear about the election?
- No,

48:23.333 --> 48:25.426
It's just a title, really,

48:25.502 --> 48:29.666
I have big plans for all of us
here in Halloweentown,

48:29.740 --> 48:33.574
You are the last person
I ever expected to see here,

48:34.077 --> 48:36.238
It's been a long time, huh?

48:43.520 --> 48:45.545
(Gwen gasps)

48:48.058 --> 48:52.051
You always did let your magic
do the talking, Thank you,

48:52.663 --> 48:56.030
You used to like it,
Or have you forgotten that part?

48:56.099 --> 48:58.226
Uh, no,

48:59.102 --> 49:02.230
- What's goin' on here?
- I have no idea,

49:02.606 --> 49:06.940
You know, I always hoped
you'd come back, Now here you are,

49:07.010 --> 49:09.706
Say, I ought to show you around,
We could take the Styx river cruise,

49:09.780 --> 49:13.147
Have a little dinner, Then I could show you
all our old haunts, eh?

49:13.216 --> 49:15.377
Um, actually, I'm trying to leave,

49:15.452 --> 49:17.147
Uh,,,

49:17.220 --> 49:19.882
It seems the bus was delayed,
and I was hoping that the,,,

49:19.957 --> 49:23.393
You were hoping
the mayor could help you out,

49:23.460 --> 49:24.893
I'm sorry,

49:24.962 --> 49:26.930
(grunting)

49:26.997 --> 49:31.093
Excuse me, sir, Miss Sticky here,
I'll get right to the point,

49:31.168 --> 49:33.932
Have a very urgent message, Ooh!

49:34.004 --> 49:37.337
Somebody's on pins and needles! (laughs)

49:41.044 --> 49:43.706
Pins and needles, (cackles)

49:43.780 --> 49:45.975
Ooh-hoo!

49:47.784 --> 49:49.752
(Calabar sighs)

49:49.820 --> 49:52.846
This is an emergency,
Won't take long,

49:52.923 --> 49:56.620
Just stay put,
I'll see what I can do for you when I return,

49:57.194 --> 49:59.822
Thank you,

50:00.731 --> 50:02.858
Kids,

50:02.933 --> 50:04.332
What was that all about?

50:04.401 --> 50:06.335
Well, obviously he's Mom's old boyfriend,

50:06.403 --> 50:07.495
Marnie!

50:07.571 --> 50:09.505
I guess you like magic
when he does it, huh?

50:09.573 --> 50:10.562
That's enough,

50:10.640 --> 50:13.040
Oh, and if you marry him,
I am not calling him "Dad,"

50:13.110 --> 50:19.049
I'm not marrying anyone, and this
discussion is over, We are going home,

50:26.156 --> 50:28.886
- (sighs)
- Go away, Luke, I'm not in the mood,

50:28.959 --> 50:33.020
Family trouble, huh, Grammy?
Guess it's just you again,

50:33.096 --> 50:35.860
You know, it must get pretty frustrating,

50:35.932 --> 50:38.958
fighting this thing all alone,
no one believing you,

50:39.036 --> 50:41.027
What do you know about that?

50:41.104 --> 50:45.063
I know you've got Merlin's talisman,
And he wants it,

50:45.375 --> 50:48.401
"He," Who is "he"?

50:48.945 --> 50:50.913
Don't know, huh?

50:50.981 --> 50:54.417
It's funny, because he knows all about you,

50:54.484 --> 50:56.315
And about that brew
you were working on, too,

50:56.386 --> 50:59.787
Well, if he's so powerful, why is he hiding?

50:59.856 --> 51:01.881
Why doesn't he reveal himself?

51:02.325 --> 51:04.793
You see, that's why I'm here,

51:04.861 --> 51:07.523
He wants to reveal himself,,,

51:07.597 --> 51:09.588
to you,

51:09.666 --> 51:11.361
Come on, Grammy, admit it,

51:11.435 --> 51:13.835
You're dying to know, right?

51:13.904 --> 51:17.499
Or is the big, powerful
Cromwell witch afraid?

51:17.574 --> 51:21.340
I don't fear him or any creature,

51:21.411 --> 51:23.504
Take me to him,

51:27.050 --> 51:30.247
But, Mom, I mean,
you can go home if you want to,

51:30.320 --> 51:31.981
I mean, Sophie probably
doesn't belong here,

51:32.055 --> 51:35.547
and Dylan thinks he's hallucinating
anyway, I'll be all right by myself,

51:35.625 --> 51:37.354
Marnie, you're 13,

51:37.427 --> 51:40.692
But all the other witches get to do
all kinds of stuff when they're 13,

51:40.764 --> 51:44.427
Just because your grandmother said
that you're a witch doesn't make you one,

51:44.501 --> 51:46.469
She didn't have to tell me,

51:46.536 --> 51:49.004
I-I could feel it,

51:49.072 --> 51:52.667
I am a witch, right? Right?

51:55.078 --> 51:56.272
Shh,

51:56.346 --> 51:58.906
So it's true!

51:58.982 --> 52:02.918
I am a witch!
Well, how come I never knew?

52:03.587 --> 52:06.886
All this weird stuff's been happening
to Sophie, Did that stuff happen to me?

52:06.957 --> 52:10.051
Yes, Yes, you showed signs
of having the powers,

52:10.127 --> 52:13.096
and I hid them from you,
just like I am doing with Sophie,

52:13.163 --> 52:15.097
And I did it for you,

52:15.165 --> 52:17.497
Because this is not your world,

52:17.567 --> 52:21.298
Your father was human,
and that is the world that we live in,

52:21.371 --> 52:22.895
Period,

52:22.973 --> 52:28.639
Look, if you want to give up your roots,
that's fine, but I don't,

52:28.712 --> 52:32.239
And it's not right for you
to try to make me,

52:32.315 --> 52:36.615
Look, Grandma's going somewhere
with the wiener dude,

52:42.993 --> 52:44.756
I gotta help Grandma,

52:44.828 --> 52:48.161
Marnie, you get back here!

52:48.231 --> 52:49.289
(sighs)

52:49.366 --> 52:51.459
Guys, come on,

52:52.536 --> 52:55.300
Why do the troublemakers
get all the attention?

53:12.589 --> 53:15.490
(door hinges creaking)

53:17.661 --> 53:19.629
(door slams shut)

53:55.065 --> 53:56.999
Harriet?

54:14.050 --> 54:17.076
(laughing)

54:17.153 --> 54:19.951
Welcome to my museum,

54:20.023 --> 54:22.082
(laughing)

54:24.227 --> 54:26.855
So this is why so many have disappeared?

54:26.930 --> 54:31.367
First you put them under an evil spell,
and then you turn them into statues,

54:31.434 --> 54:35.768
No, not statues,
They're very much alive!

54:35.839 --> 54:40.003
Merely frozen in time until I need them,

54:40.076 --> 54:43.011
To do what?
To destroy our world?

54:43.079 --> 54:48.847
Ah, I know you have Merlin's talisman,

54:48.918 --> 54:50.180
Give it to me!

54:50.253 --> 54:52.585
I do have the talisman,

54:52.656 --> 54:58.117
And soon your hold over the creatures
of Halloweentown will be broken forever!

54:58.194 --> 55:00.389
No, you foolish witch!

55:00.463 --> 55:04.763
You think your magic
is more powerful than mine?

55:05.735 --> 55:08.465
Yeah, as if that could happen,

55:08.538 --> 55:12.304
There is nothing you can do to stop me!

55:12.375 --> 55:15.242
Zip, nada, zero, goose eggs,

55:15.312 --> 55:21.649
I will bend the creatures of this world
to my will, one by one,

55:21.718 --> 55:25.552
Two by two and three by three,

55:25.622 --> 55:28.113
Will you shut up?!

55:29.626 --> 55:31.116
Sorry,

55:31.194 --> 55:33.628
Give me the talisman!

55:33.697 --> 55:35.722
Never!

55:35.799 --> 55:39.997
Then suffer the consequences,

55:41.871 --> 55:42.838
No!

55:50.847 --> 55:53.816
No, You said she'd be safe,

55:53.883 --> 55:56.784
You cannot escape me, old woman,

55:56.853 --> 56:01.222
The creature hasn't been born
that's quick enough to catch a Cromwell!

56:02.025 --> 56:03.959
- Mother?
- Grandma?

56:04.027 --> 56:06.427
- Get them!
- That's it,

56:06.496 --> 56:09.693
- Leave my family alone!
- I'm out of here,

56:09.766 --> 56:14.601
Wastrel youth of benighted hours,
be thee vanquished by my powers!

56:14.671 --> 56:16.138
Hm?

56:16.206 --> 56:19.664
I said "powers," not "flowers,"

56:19.743 --> 56:21.472
Way to go, Mom!

56:21.544 --> 56:23.409
This is your last chance,

56:23.480 --> 56:25.675
Give me the talisman,

56:25.749 --> 56:27.546
Never!

56:27.617 --> 56:29.915
Keep your brother and sister back!

56:33.089 --> 56:35.182
Mom!

56:35.258 --> 56:36.987
(panting)

56:37.060 --> 56:38.550
Gwen!

56:38.628 --> 56:41.222
Sleep now, Agatha Cromwell,

56:41.297 --> 56:46.929
and when you awake, I will be your master,

56:48.738 --> 56:49.830
No!

56:49.906 --> 56:52.204
- Come on!
- We've got to save them!

56:52.275 --> 56:55.733
We can't save them unless
we save ourselves first, Come on,

56:56.112 --> 56:58.342
Argh!

56:58.415 --> 57:01.213
- Marnie,,,
- Grandma!

57:01.284 --> 57:04.082
We'll be all right, Go!

57:04.154 --> 57:08.784
It's just an evil spell that freezes us,

57:08.858 --> 57:11.418
Go!

57:14.431 --> 57:15.796
Marnie, let's go,

57:25.642 --> 57:27.371
Ugh,

57:27.444 --> 57:29.378
What are we doing?
We gotta get back to Grandma's house,

57:29.446 --> 57:31.607
- No, not yet,
- Not yet? Are you crazy?

57:31.681 --> 57:33.774
That shadow thing
is gonna turn us into statues,

57:33.850 --> 57:37.752
It isn't gonna follow us,
Didn't you see? It can't stand the light,

57:37.821 --> 57:40.756
I want Mommy and Grandma,

57:43.993 --> 57:45.153
(sighs)

57:45.228 --> 57:51.497
Don't worry, Your big sister
is gonna get Mommy and Grandma back,

57:52.302 --> 57:55.396
- You are?
- Well, duh,

57:55.472 --> 57:57.303
Of course I am,

57:58.174 --> 58:00.938
But there are some things
we need to get first,

58:01.010 --> 58:03.570
You're gonna do some shopping?
Can't this wait?

58:03.646 --> 58:05.546
No, we have to finish that witches' brew,

58:05.615 --> 58:09.142
Getting that talisman lit is our only chance
of saving Mom and Grandma,

58:09.219 --> 58:12.245
Here, I copied the ingredients
from Grandma's cookbook,

58:12.322 --> 58:16.315
- Hair of a werewolf, sweat of a ghost,,,?
- Come on, Dylan,

58:16.392 --> 58:21.853
We're Cromwells,
Together we can conquer anything,

58:26.536 --> 58:27.798
(sighs)

58:29.405 --> 58:31.339
I don't know,

58:33.042 --> 58:34.475
Come on,

58:38.615 --> 58:41.345
(overlapping chatter)

58:41.417 --> 58:45.183
(hair dryers blowing)

58:45.255 --> 58:47.280
Take a gander!

58:47.357 --> 58:51.794
Look at you, sweetheart, You are
coming along like a fast bride, baby,

58:51.861 --> 58:54.193
First stop, Wolfie's,

58:55.298 --> 58:57.323
We're gonna start by conquering bad hair?

58:57.400 --> 59:00.892
- Well, he is a werewolf,
- Can I help you kids?

59:00.970 --> 59:05.805
Oh, yeah, um, I was just wondering
if you had any part-time jobs available,

59:05.875 --> 59:10.039
- Maybe, like, after school or something?
- No, no, No, I'm sorry, We don't,

59:10.113 --> 59:14.482
Oh, this sulfuric acid treatment
is coming along nicely,

59:14.551 --> 59:19.386
It's really gonna split your ends
and bring out those roots, baby,

59:19.455 --> 59:21.753
But I've always wanted
to become a beauty technician,

59:21.824 --> 59:23.724
Oh, careful, Loki, Careful,

59:23.793 --> 59:26.193
She's an herb, not a shrub, OK?

59:26.262 --> 59:29.527
Think salad - light, crispy,

59:30.633 --> 59:33.568
Well, you know, um,
I could really be a help

59:33.636 --> 59:37.037
maybe, uh, sweeping
the trimmings around the shop,

59:37.106 --> 59:40.007
- Maybe even doing some hairstyling,
- Don't touch that, OK?

59:40.076 --> 59:42.909
- Don't worry, I use these all the time,
- Put that down,

59:44.414 --> 59:47.872
The other button! Turn it off,
Will you please just turn it off?

59:47.951 --> 59:51.079
- I'll get it off, I'll get it off, OK?
- No, no, The other button,

59:51.154 --> 59:53.748
What I need you to do,,, It's only
to be used by a trained professionals

59:53.823 --> 59:55.688
so just put the thing down,

59:55.758 --> 59:56.747
I got it, I got it,

59:56.826 --> 59:59.351
The other button, sweetheart,
Put the thing down,

59:59.429 --> 01:00:01.556
(howls)

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:05.530
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Call me if you need me!

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.628
Come back here, you little hum,,,

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:14.866
Hey, this could be a good look for me,

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.605
Yeah, baby,

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:26.553
Round, Round,
Run around,

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:30.992
Turn and turn, and number two,
and turn and turn,

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:35.224
And stir the cauldron,
One, two, three,

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:38.267
With your left hand,
now we're gonna stroke and stroke,

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:40.734
Keep those hips moving, and stroke,

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:44.569
Keep on going, now, Stroke,
And, dogs, keep on up with the others,

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.371
No slobbering on people, huh?
Please,

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:49.536
Stroke and stroke,

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:52.342
Keep on going now,
Stroke and stroke,

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:56.681
There's gotta be a ghost
around here someplace, Come on,

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.990
(Sophie) Snot Man!

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.830
Ghosts are dead,
Why would they worry about fitness?

01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:15.700
Come on,

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:29.481
- Look, a real ghost,
- And a real sweat box,

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:40.325
All right, distract him long enough
so I can get the sweat,

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:43.263
Would you get a grip? He can't sweat,
He doesn't have a body,

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:45.892
Just distract him,

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:04.679
So, uh, did you know that Sea-Monkeys
are actually shrimp?

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:08.453
No,

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:09.923
Keep going,

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:11.721
Um,,,

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:17.027
Did you know that there is no
proper name for the back of the knee?

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:20.732
You don't say,

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:22.930
(moaning)

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:26.337
Very funny, kid,
Now go back to your mommy,

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.604
(moaning)

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:32.205
Hey, kid, I don't appreciate stereotypes
like that, all right?

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:34.442
(Sophie continues moaning)

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:37.748
Sure, sure,
Make fun of the transparent guy,

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:43.122
Just 'cause you can see through us
doesn't mean we don't have feelings,

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:46.785
Whoo, is it getting hot in here,

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:49.696
Hades was nothing compared to this,

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:54.362
Can I get some help over here?
Burning up!

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.531
- Attendant!
- Yes! Got it! OK, come on,

01:02:57.607 --> 01:03:00.303
Attendant!
Attendant!

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:03.106
- Thanks,
- Attendant!

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:09.313
(high-pitched) Attendant!

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.555
(screaming)

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:33.568
Oh, my, I'm afraid that one's
gonna have to come out,

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:38.444
Is it going to hurt? Don't hurt me, doctor!
I'm not very good with pain,

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:44.419
Oh, now, now,
Don't worry, you won't feel a thing,

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.648
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:49.316
(squishing sounds)

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:54.463
Wow, doc,
That didn't hurt at all,

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:59.627
Well, after all, I am the tooth fairy,

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:07.169
Vampire's fang, yes!

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.746
- There she is, Come on,
- I got it, I got it!

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:13.213
(tires screeching)

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:18.351
Say there, if it ain't the Cromwell kids,

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:20.616
I hear your mother's in town,

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.989
Um, well, yeah, she just, uh,
she's hanging out with our grandma,

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.961
We just came to do a little shopping,
but we're done now, OK? So, bye,

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:30.829
Hey, I got a fare up that way anyway,
Why don't you let me give you a lift?

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.993
On the house,

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:35.695
Hey, that'd be great, Thanks,

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:39.507
- What is it, Sophie?
- The bad thing is in him,

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:43.477
- What?
- Little kids, What an imagination, huh?

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:47.038
Come on, get in,
I gotta go,

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:51.517
- Wait, who told you our mom was here?
- Hey, what's with the third degree here?

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:55.455
- Get in the cab!
- (screams)

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:57.617
Hey, let him go,

01:04:57.693 --> 01:04:59.661
Help me, Get me out of here,
Let me go,

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.027
Let him go,
Let him go, you bonehead, Stop,

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:06.762
Come on, you little Cromwell punk,
You think you're so smart!

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.397
Fetch the bone,

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:11.702
(screams)

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:13.708
Not the dog!

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:18.277
(barking)

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:26.953
- Thanks, Soph,
- Come on, let's get going,

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:41.560
All right, here it is, Vampire fang,
ghost sweat, werewolf hair a la mode,

01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:46.933
Here,

01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:02.454
- What are you waiting for?
- I can't remember Grandma's spell,

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:04.254
What do you mean, you can't remember?

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:06.693
It was Old English or Welsh or something,

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:09.230
I mean, give me a break,
I have trouble remembering agua.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:13.029
I thought you said you're a witch, The least
you can do is remember a dumb spell,

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:14.899
OK, OK,

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.461
Uh,,,

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:23.840
"Betty March, Betty Gunther,
Betty, uh, Guggenheim, is all that's bid?"

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.241
OK, um,,,

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:30.444
"Better march, better get there,

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:33.352
better get going before
there's no more beds,"

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:36.357
That's the best you can do?
Why didn't you write it down or,,,?

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:41.124
Bet y March, bet y Guythur,
bet y Gugaun...

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:42.596
What is it, Soph?

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:47.159
Bet y March, bet y Guythur,
bet y Gugaun,

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:51.172
Cledyfrutm anoeth bid.

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:54.842
That's it!
How did you remember it, Soph?

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:58.141
It sounded pretty,
so I made up a song for it,

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:01.012
Bet y March, bet y Guythur...

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:03.051
I like to make up songs,

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:06.748
You know, Grandma says
that spells are stronger

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:10.223
when you have more than one witch,
You wanna help me?

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:13.489
- OK,
- OK,

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:17.020
(both) Bet y March, bet y Guythur,

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:22.833
bet y Gugaun, Cledyfrutm anoeth bid.

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:27.205
- Oh, drat,
- Great, it's not working, Now what?

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:30.211
Um, let's see,

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:32.213
(sighs)

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:38.244
Grandma says that spells are simple,

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.188
That you just have to want it
and then let yourself have it,

01:07:42.258 --> 01:07:44.556
OK, let's do it,

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:49.727
(both) Bet y March, bet y Guythur,

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:55.260
bet y Gugaun, Cledyfrutm anoeth bid.

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:58.240
You did it, you guys, It's lit,

01:07:58.307 --> 01:08:01.242
I did it! We did it,
We're witches,

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:04.575
You can celebrate later,
Come on, let's get out of here,

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:23.763
- Keep the door open,
- Duh,

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:31.969
Are they gonna be OK?

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.710
I think so,
I can hear her heart beating,

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.109
Grandma, too,

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.908
(rumbling)

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.419
It's the bad thing,

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.419
Work, you dumb thing, work,

01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:53.359
Why isn't it working?

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.828
I don't know,

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:59.299
Grandma said something
about installing it,

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:02.462
What? Installing it?
Installing it where?

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:15.682
Mortal see, mortal do,

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:17.582
What?

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:21.247
Remember what Grandma said about
our traditions being an imitation of theirs?

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:22.312
What about it?

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:25.986
Well, when it's dark on Halloween,
where do you put the candle? Come on,

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:36.828
You can't be serious, You're not
actually thinking of going into that thing,

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:40.341
I have to, It's the only way
to save Mom and Grandma,

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.308
But what are we gonna do?

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:46.473
Stay here,
And wish me luck,

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:48.312
Good luck, Marnie,

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:53.310
Good luck,

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:02.192
- Marnie, it's a trap, He's waiting for you,
- Out of my way, Luke,

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:04.494
Look, about what happened earlier,

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:06.831
I didn't know he was gonna do that
to your mom and grandma,

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:09.462
Save your tricks, twerp, OK?
I'm busy,

01:10:09.538 --> 01:10:11.369
No, I swear,

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.137
He said all he wanted was the talisman
and that he'd let your grandma go,

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.577
I said get out of my way,

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.760
He's coming,

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:43.003
My fellow creatures,

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:48.908
your moment of destiny has arrived,

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:52.941
I offer you the chance

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:57.008
to return to our days of glory,

01:10:57.086 --> 01:11:01.819
to end this exile from the Mortal World,

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:05.382
which the humans have stolen from us,

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:14.034
Follow me,
my fellow citizens of Halloweentown,

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:19.131
Too long have we been exiled

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:23.542
to this second-class world,

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:29.414
Forced to live here in this Halloweentown,

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:34.948
I've got to install this thing
before it's too late,

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:38.118
No, he'll see you,
You'll end up just like the others,

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:40.855
,,, to our true natures,

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:45.195
to celebrate the evil within us,

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:50.728
to reveal ourselves as we really are,

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:52.933
Calabar?

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:54.999
(Calabar laughing)

01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:57.307
I can't believe Mom dated that guy,

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:01.683
Follow me,

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:06.847
and together we will reclaim
the Mortal World which is rightfully ours,

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:10.949
- You knew?
- Look, I made an awful mistake,

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:14.655
So let me try and make up for it,

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:17.122
It's our only chance,

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:20.635
But before we can be sure of success,

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:24.901
we must find the one who would stop us,

01:12:24.973 --> 01:12:27.840
The one who is half human,

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:32.537
Oh, young Cromwell,

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:36.744
you thought you could hide from me?

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:38.343
Stop,

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.650
Give me the talisman,

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.790
I said stop!

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:45.884
Give me the talisman!

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:52.829
How dare you disobey me?

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:58.869
(crowd screaming)

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:09.711
Fooled ya,

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.988
No!

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:22.055
(groaning)

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.103
He got her and it's not working,
We've lost,,, Ow!

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:43.045
You see, my friends?
The power of evil is stronger than good,

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:46.212
Join me,
Join me,

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:48.920
(Gwen) You are not a witch.

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:52.757
(Marnie) Oh, yes, I am, no thanks to you...
There's nothing special about me.

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:56.229
(Aggie) Oh no, dear.
You're very special. You're a Cromwwell.

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:59.790
Magic is really very simple.
All you have to do is want something

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:03.269
and then let yourself have it.

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.598
(Marnie) Believe.

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:16.579
It's working!

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:35.963
- Gwen,
- Mother,

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:38.165
Gwen, the children,

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:55.388
(crowd cheering)

01:14:58.026 --> 01:15:00.187
(grunting)

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:04.062
- You did it,
- Guys!

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:07.397
Good going, Looks like you got
more than the weird part down,

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:09.699
Ah! Mom!

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:11.500
Oh, thank goodness,

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:12.972
- Grandma,
- Oh!

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:15.908
Oh, thank goodness you're OK,

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:19.675
Oh, you've got all the power
of the Cromwells

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:21.648
and twice the guts,

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:25.517
- Grandma, it was,,, it was Calabar,
- What?

01:15:33.729 --> 01:15:35.822
So, it was you,

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:38.731
Why, Calabar?

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.633
You could've had me,

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:45.264
the most powerful warlock of all,

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:50.471
You could have ruled with me
as my queen,

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:54.676
but you chose a human instead,

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:58.117
Well, it turns out she was
a pretty good judge of character,

01:15:58.186 --> 01:16:01.383
Your days of rule are at an end, Calabar,

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:06.223
Do not underestimate me, Agatha,

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:14.360
Now my darkness will spread unchecked

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:18.896
and I will be ruler of both worlds!

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:21.067
(laughs)

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:25.978
Dictu jubentis vivida...

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:28.107
(both) upitidas...

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:33.849
Repelle, quod cupidinis
ciente vi nos impetit!

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.720
Don't waste your energies, witches,

01:16:37.225 --> 01:16:39.853
Your precious talisman is nothing more,,,

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:42.590
Man, that jerk, I'd like to,,,

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:44.393
I'd like to,,,

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:46.093
(Calabar laughing)

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.430
- Dylan!
- What?

01:16:47.502 --> 01:16:50.266
Looks like we just added
another witch to the family,

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:53.069
Or should I say warlock?

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:55.709
(Calabar),,, like a dark shadow over,,,

01:16:55.777 --> 01:17:01.238
No way, I don't have any powers,
I'm the normal one in this family,

01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:06.613
Hey, Chocolate Bar, you better give
that talisman back or you're in big trouble,

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:09.384
You half-human brat,

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:13.292
Do you think that your magic
is any match for mine?

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:15.792
Hm, no,

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:18.924
But let's see if my powers and my mom's

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:21.765
and my grandmother's and my sister's

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:25.102
and my brother's might do it,

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:28.272
Hit it, guys,

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:33.473
(all humming)

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:45.217
Silly witches,
You Cromwells have failed,

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:48.990
Come on, Dylan, we need you,
Believe,

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:05.240
(all continue humming)

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:12.013
No, No!

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:18.484
(screams) No!

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:23.655
Oh,,,

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:26.425
The talisman!

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:30.738
Oh! Ooh!

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:34.367
You did a fabulous job, all of you,

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:45.312
I'm so proud of you,

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:48.447
- Mom?
- Yes, sweetheart?

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:50.286
You were right,

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:54.886
There was a lot about Halloweentown
that I,,, I didn't understand,

01:18:54.963 --> 01:18:59.229
And I'm sorry about the things
I said and did,

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:02.134
And I'm sorry that I didn't trust you,

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:07.801
You are everything I could've ever hoped
for in a daughter and so much more,

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:10.903
Thank you,

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:14.676
Oh, my, you've got
quite a coven here, my dear,

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:18.481
- And I thought they were a handful before,
- Hey, it wasn't me,

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:21.317
That stuff coming out of my fingertips
was probably just static electricity,

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:24.051
Or maybe that aurora borealis thing
I was reading about,

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:27.220
You know, something like that,

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:30.931
I forgot about Luke,

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:36.602
Luke?

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:39.095
Hi,

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:43.767
Wow,
So this is the real you?

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:47.241
Want to know the worst part?

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:50.910
I wasn't even under a spell or anything,

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:54.649
I did what I did
because he made me handsome,

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:59.653
Guess it wasn't much of a reason
for being all evil and all, huh?

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:02.060
Especially since
even when I was good-looking,

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.894
I didn't have a chance
of getting a date with you,

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:08.800
- A date?
- Yeah, it was stupid,

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.135
Wow,

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:17.877
I guess I didn't turn
into a handsome prince though, huh?

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:22.212
No, But you did that before
when you decided to help me,

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:25.219
I never could've done it without you,

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:27.380
Thanks,

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:30.822
Hey, if you ever come back
to Halloweentown, look me up,

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:34.796
- I'll do that,
- Great,

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.465
Marnie, we have to go,

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:41.832
Luke, we have a job for you,

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:05.321
Well, I suppose I'll have
to give the children back now,

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:09.022
You know, Mother, I have to admit,
you're really very good with them,

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:11.361
- Thank you,
- You know, I was thinking,

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:13.333
I could use a babysitter
on Thursday nights,

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:16.370
You know my PTA meetings,
sometimes they go on forever,

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:20.033
Well, dear, you know that I can't cross over,
Only on Halloween night,

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:21.336
Hm,

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:25.209
Well, then I guess you're just
gonna have to come live with us,

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:29.076
That is, if you want to,

01:21:30.118 --> 01:21:33.281
Grandma's gonna come live with us?
Oh, that'll be so cool,

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:34.788
OK, I can show you all my books,

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:36.983
and I have all the Frankenstein
movies on video,

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:40.255
And then you can show me how to,,,
Oh, no! Where's my broom?

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:43.255
Oh, don't panic, dear, don't panic,
(whistles)

01:21:45.767 --> 01:21:49.362
Yes, follows me everywhere,

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:51.905
Open it up, open it up, open,

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:57.035
My broom!

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:59.342
- I thought we could continue your studies,
- Yes,

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:02.474
- Uh, no,
- What?

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:05.713
I'm gonna be finishing your training,

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:08.183
Oh!

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:11.020
(ringing bell)
All aboard for the Mortal World!

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:14.289
Oh! All aboard, all aboard,
Come on, the smallest first,

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:18.197
I'm gonna figure out how this thing works,

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:20.734
We've got the bag,
On you go, on you go,

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:23.168
Watch your step,

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:26.173
- Bye, bye,
- (applause)

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:31.577
See you, everybody, Bye,

01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:33.705
(Dylan) Bye,

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:37.008
Bye,

01:22:37.085 --> 01:22:40.612
Thanks, kids,
See you in the afterlife, Ha!

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:43.187
Bye, Benny,

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:45.283
(all) Bye!

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.126
See you later,
I can feel it in my bones, Ha!

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:52.758
See ya, So long,

01:22:52.834 --> 01:22:54.699
Bye, kids,
