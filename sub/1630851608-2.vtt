00:06.965 --> 00:08.508
JON FAVREAU: <i>I think there's a interplay</i>

00:08.591 --> 00:11.136
<i>with storytellers and the people</i>
<i>you're telling the story to.</i>

00:11.219 --> 00:13.221
THE MANDALORIAN:
Does this look Jedi to you?

00:13.304 --> 00:15.640
You find that the emotions
run deep with <i>Star Wars.</i>

00:15.724 --> 00:19.644
And peoples' relationship,
who grew up with it from a young age,

00:19.728 --> 00:21.312
<i>feel a lot of connection to it.</i>

00:24.190 --> 00:27.027
<i>I think a consistent thing I'm feeling</i>
<i>is that people care deeply</i>

00:27.110 --> 00:31.448
<i>that it's being handled correctly</i>
<i>and that it's being handled respectfully.</i>

00:32.240 --> 00:35.368
<i>It meant so much and they wanna</i>
<i>see it continue into the future</i>

00:35.452 --> 00:38.747
<i>and feel like it's all connected</i>
<i>with consistency.</i>

00:39.164 --> 00:43.043
We're very lucky
that between Lucasfilm and Kathy,

00:43.126 --> 00:44.961
the whole group that we have

00:45.045 --> 00:48.048
are incredibly supportive and encouraging.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.967
(COOS)

00:51.051 --> 00:53.011
BO-KATAN: <i>Incoming craft,</i>
<i>identify yourself.</i>

00:56.222 --> 00:59.267
Jon gave me the script
for the season finale.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.144
I read it and loved it.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.188
<i>It had a lot of action.</i>

01:03.271 --> 01:07.734
<i>It had a lot of great character stuff</i>
<i>and a lot of emotion.</i>

01:07.817 --> 01:10.111
But there was a character
that came in at the end of it,

01:10.195 --> 01:12.947
and in the script it was written
as a character called Plo Koon.

01:13.031 --> 01:16.910
<i>And I knew Plo Koon was a Jedi,</i>
<i>I think, from the prequel trilogy.</i>

01:16.993 --> 01:18.536
I was, "How are we visualizing this?"

01:18.620 --> 01:20.872
He's like, "Come here,
I wanna talk to you."

01:20.955 --> 01:26.169
And he gave me the real news
that it was, in fact, not Plo Koon,

01:26.252 --> 01:30.173
but it was gonna be Luke.
And I needed a moment.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.718
<i>I needed to know, 'cause I've had</i>
<i>a long relationship with Jon</i>

01:33.802 --> 01:36.596
and I said,
"Are you being serious? Is this real?

01:36.679 --> 01:38.348
"You're bringing the guy back?"

01:38.431 --> 01:40.266
He said, "We're bringing
the guy back." (CHUCKLES)

01:41.309 --> 01:46.022
Jon sanctioned this, I'll say this for
the first time in 15 months to two years.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.107
"Luke Skywalker."

01:47.816 --> 01:49.234
<i>We were never allowed to say it.</i>

01:49.317 --> 01:51.069
We'll get the performance out of Plo Koon,

01:51.152 --> 01:53.696
and in post,
we can get a bunch of options.

01:53.780 --> 01:57.283
When we refer back to what we did,
we talk about the code names.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.702
<i>We simply do not utter those two words.</i>

01:59.786 --> 02:03.289
If there's one person in the galaxy
that you'd be okay

02:03.373 --> 02:05.750
taking this kid from The Mandalorian,

02:05.834 --> 02:07.627
<i>it's gotta be Luke.</i>

02:08.378 --> 02:10.755
<i>You know, usually,</i>
<i>Jon and I tend to think...</i>

02:10.839 --> 02:13.842
<i>If he and I are aligned</i>
<i>on something like that,</i>

02:13.925 --> 02:16.845
it's probably gonna,
I like to think, turn out good.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.597
But if I had been like, "No way. Luke..."

02:19.722 --> 02:22.433
Jon would respect that,
"Okay, let's figure it out."

02:22.517 --> 02:25.103
But it just felt right to both of us.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.730
Even the Force
that's just moving around him.

02:27.814 --> 02:31.651
So, every move you're making
is one step ahead.

02:31.734 --> 02:34.445
I instantly went from being thrilled
to feeling the weight

02:34.529 --> 02:36.990
of responsibility of this character.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.534
<i>Because outside</i>
<i>of all the technical considerations</i>

02:39.617 --> 02:44.038
<i>of how we were gonna bring</i>
<i>Luke Skywalker of that period to life,</i>

02:44.664 --> 02:46.916
<i>there was a real responsibility</i>
<i>in the storytelling</i>

02:47.000 --> 02:50.503
to have it feel organic
in the context of <i>The Mandalorian.</i>

02:51.045 --> 02:55.383
Because it's very easy to see a version
where you bring Luke into <i>The Mandalorian,</i>

02:55.466 --> 02:57.802
and it completely usurps all the drama.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.556
REED: <i>We had a lot of conversations</i>

03:01.639 --> 03:04.684
<i>in the writing,</i>
<i>in the shooting, in editorial,</i>

03:04.767 --> 03:09.355
<i>about how much Luke was enough,</i>
<i>how much was too much,</i>

03:09.439 --> 03:10.690
<i>finding that balance.</i>

03:10.773 --> 03:12.192
Weirdly, he's a device.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.320
I mean, he comes in,
it's not like he's the delivery guy.

03:15.403 --> 03:18.990
You know, none of the characters
are sitting there in awe of,

03:19.073 --> 03:22.118
"It's Luke Skywalker. He's the guy
who blew up those Death Stars."

03:22.202 --> 03:26.789
<i>That's not where they're coming from.</i>
<i>He is a Jedi. He's this mythical figure,</i>

03:26.873 --> 03:29.834
<i>because none of them</i>
<i>have ever really encountered a Jedi.</i>

03:29.918 --> 03:34.172
That was interesting to me.
I felt like, as I think Jon and Dave felt,

03:34.255 --> 03:37.175
that this is a balancing act
that we can figure out,

03:37.258 --> 03:40.720
and we can make it feel
still like <i>The Mandalorian,</i>

03:40.803 --> 03:42.847
while broadening the palette a bit.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.143
FILONI: <i>It was this</i>
<i>carefully-laid discussion.</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:51.022
<i>You know, the stages of,</i>
<i>"Is it gonna be him?"</i>

03:51.105 --> 03:52.357
"How could it be him?"

03:52.440 --> 03:56.402
Because we realized, watching it,
that you're kind of in denial,

03:56.486 --> 03:58.738
no matter how obvious we made it.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.992
You do not think it's gonna be him
when that hood comes off.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.246
<i>Like, that shot, it was the one</i>
<i>of all the shots that had to work,</i>

04:06.329 --> 04:10.708
<i>because it was gonna be</i>
<i>the completion of this wish fulfillment,</i>

04:11.417 --> 04:12.961
<i>"Is it really Luke?"</i>

04:14.462 --> 04:16.798
We knew we wanted
Mark Hamill front and center,

04:16.881 --> 04:19.050
because you can't
bring back Luke Skywalker

04:19.133 --> 04:20.134
without Mark Hamill.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.845
I suppose technologically-speaking,
you could.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.640
But we didn't want to.
We wanted to have the real guy.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.934
We wanted Mark here.
'Cause he is Luke Skywalker.

04:28.017 --> 04:31.479
I was contacted by Jon and Dave,

04:31.562 --> 04:35.566
<i>inviting me to come over</i>
<i>and take a look at</i> The Mandalorian.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.403
They said they'd love my opinion.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.114
That should've been a giveaway right away.

04:41.781 --> 04:45.535
<i>So I went over</i>
<i>and they asked me to do a voice</i>

04:45.618 --> 04:49.455
<i>for a character that was in the cantina.</i>

04:49.539 --> 04:52.375
THE MANDALORIAN: I'm a hunter.
I'm lookin' for some work.

04:52.458 --> 04:56.754
Unfortunately, the Bounty Guild
no longer operates from Tatooine.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.132
He often will do unbilled cameos

04:59.215 --> 05:02.343
as voice talent
for other <i>Star Wars</i> projects.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.430
-FINN: How do we thank you?
-Win the war!

05:06.639 --> 05:08.683
So it made perfect sense
that we'd bring him in.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.768
<i>But we started showing him</i>
<i>a lot of the stuff,</i>

05:10.852 --> 05:12.770
<i>and this is before anything had aired.</i>

05:12.854 --> 05:15.315
<i>We showed him</i>
<i>that first episode with the reveal.</i>

05:15.398 --> 05:19.527
And he was really captivated by it,
he really liked it.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.529
He liked where we were going with it.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.991
So we told him
what we were thinking of doing.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.996
DARTH VADER:
It is pointless to resist, my son.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.916
HAMILL: <i>When they went</i>
<i>from the original trilogy to the sequels,</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:37.086
<i>obviously there was this huge gap in time,</i>

05:37.170 --> 05:39.797
<i>where there's all these untold stories.</i>

05:40.548 --> 05:43.760
<i>But I just assumed they'd get</i>
<i>an age-appropriate actor, you know?</i>

05:43.843 --> 05:46.012
<i>And I didn't really</i>
<i>think about it all that much.</i>

05:46.095 --> 05:48.139
I just thought,
"If they wanna tell stories

05:48.222 --> 05:51.851
"of Luke <i>post-Return of The Jedi,</i>
I wonder who they'll get."

05:51.934 --> 05:54.312
When they said they were
gonna use the de-aging process

05:54.395 --> 05:56.731
<i>they used in the Marvel movies,</i>

05:56.814 --> 05:58.524
<i>I was just gobsmacked!</i>

05:58.608 --> 06:01.152
I didn't answer right away,
I had to think about it.

06:01.319 --> 06:05.156
But the more I thought about it,
"This is really an opportunity

06:05.239 --> 06:08.034
"that was completely unexpected,

06:08.117 --> 06:11.954
"but something that almost
was a responsibility."

06:12.663 --> 06:15.249
<i>In other words, if they're saying</i>
<i>they want me to do this,</i>

06:15.792 --> 06:17.001
how can I say no?

06:18.836 --> 06:22.215
REED: <i>Over the holidays,</i>
<i>this would've been December 2019,</i>

06:22.298 --> 06:25.301
Jon and I drove up together
to Mark's house.

06:25.385 --> 06:29.931
And we brought the script.
And we brought Luke Skywalker's wardrobe.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.725
<i>And we brought Grogu with us.</i>

06:32.809 --> 06:34.811
<i>Mark was so gracious, we came in.</i>

06:34.894 --> 06:36.604
Jon and I sat with Mark's wife

06:36.687 --> 06:39.232
as he was in his office,
reading the script in real time,

06:39.315 --> 06:41.025
so we were on pins and needles,

06:41.109 --> 06:44.445
'cause it was not necessarily a given
that he was gonna be interested.

06:44.987 --> 06:48.116
<i>I think he's very protective</i>
<i>of this character, and rightfully so.</i>

06:48.199 --> 06:50.910
FAVREAU: <i>Peyton and I were just trying</i>
<i>not to jump through our skin.</i>

06:50.993 --> 06:54.080
We get into this 'cause we're fans,
so there are moments like this...

06:54.163 --> 06:56.040
Even when you get used
to making this stuff,

06:56.124 --> 06:59.085
there are certain moments
where you just... It's so surreal.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.712
REED:<i> He came out and he was thrilled.</i>

07:01.796 --> 07:05.299
And I think a huge weight
was lifted off of Jon's shoulders

07:05.383 --> 07:06.551
when that happened. (CHUCKLES)

07:06.634 --> 07:08.261
When you have those feelings

07:08.344 --> 07:11.222
where it feels compelling,
you know that you're onto something.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.015
We knew if we could pull this off,

07:13.099 --> 07:15.309
it would represent
so much to so many people.

07:15.393 --> 07:16.519
Especially to Mark.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.772
<i>To let him come in there</i>
<i>and show Luke at this moment,</i>

07:19.856 --> 07:23.943
<i>and let it be a celebration,</i>
<i>and also a culmination of a two-season arc</i>

07:24.026 --> 07:26.279
<i>about the journey of this little child.</i>

07:26.362 --> 07:27.864
THE MANDALORIAN: I'll see you again.

07:28.656 --> 07:29.657
I promise.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.369
Mark was excited, and he was in,
and he got ready to see,

07:34.162 --> 07:35.913
"How were we gonna make the magic happen?"

07:35.997 --> 07:38.249
Which is good,
'cause we had to figure it out yet.

07:40.084 --> 07:43.796
FAVREAU: <i>Kathy Kennedy we brought in</i>
<i>very early on this conversation.</i>

07:43.880 --> 07:47.425
And Kathy, first and foremost,
is a great producer.

07:47.508 --> 07:51.220
And producers figure out ways
to make things happen

07:51.304 --> 07:55.183
that are creatively exciting
to the storytellers.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.937
<i>Not only does she understand</i>
<i>how to create an environment</i>

08:00.021 --> 08:02.523
<i>where we can have</i>
<i>all the tools that we need</i>

08:02.607 --> 08:04.734
<i>to explore and experiment and be creative,</i>

08:04.817 --> 08:08.196
<i>but also knows</i>
<i>what it takes to incubate ideas</i>

08:08.279 --> 08:10.740
<i>and understands the significance</i>
<i>of when you do it right,</i>

08:10.823 --> 08:11.824
<i>what that can represent.</i>

08:14.660 --> 08:16.787
JOHN KNOLL: <i>One of the big</i>
<i>challenges on this show</i>

08:16.871 --> 08:19.582
<i>is the work is very ambitious.</i>

08:19.665 --> 08:22.251
The expectation
is the polish level to be

08:22.335 --> 08:24.670
as high as what's done on the features.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.089
<i>So, some of this is working</i>

08:27.173 --> 08:31.636
<i>with the very talented</i>
<i>and experienced artists that we have,</i>

08:31.719 --> 08:35.473
giving them a meaningful turnover
where they really understand

08:35.556 --> 08:38.601
what success means on the shots.

08:38.684 --> 08:42.146
The unique thing
about visual effects technology

08:42.230 --> 08:44.649
or technology
that can be used in visual effects,

08:44.732 --> 08:47.610
is that it can come
from so many different places.

08:47.693 --> 08:51.197
It can come from the tech realm,
it could come from a basement.

08:51.280 --> 08:56.661
<i>And I think being open</i>
<i>to getting inspiration</i>

08:56.744 --> 08:59.330
<i>for bleeding-edge technology from anywhere</i>

08:59.413 --> 09:01.582
<i>is a big part of what we do on this show.</i>

09:01.666 --> 09:05.044
When we realized that we wanted
to show a younger Luke Skywalker,

09:05.127 --> 09:07.338
we looked at all the techniques available.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.800
There's a few basic paths
you could go at this level.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.803
They're overlapping a bit,
but for simplicity's sake,

09:13.886 --> 09:17.723
you have a completely
computer-generated version of a character

09:17.807 --> 09:20.893
<i>based on scans and based on research</i>
<i>and old footage,</i>

09:20.977 --> 09:23.604
<i>and that's like what they used</i>
<i>for Grand Moff Tarkin.</i>

09:23.938 --> 09:26.732
Your work exceeds all expectations.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.943
It's pretty easy to see what that is,

09:29.026 --> 09:31.779
<i>but all these new render tools</i>
<i>and processing power</i>

09:31.862 --> 09:34.865
<i>is making that get better very rapidly.</i>

09:35.950 --> 09:37.618
There's another technique for de-aging,

09:37.702 --> 09:40.871
which is actually
like an airbrush artist doing fixes,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.583
painting out wrinkles and things.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.794
And then there's Deepfake,
which is where you use machine learning

09:46.877 --> 09:52.133
to extrapolate
from a tremendous amount of...

09:52.758 --> 09:54.552
Ingestion of images.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.470
You feed images, either from the Internet,

09:56.554 --> 09:59.849
or, in our case, you feed it
from all of the existing footage

09:59.932 --> 10:02.351
that we have of that character
at that time,

10:02.435 --> 10:07.398
and it creates a library of expressions,
faces, looks, lighting scenarios.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.484
And then, when you have
your performer perform it,

10:10.568 --> 10:15.948
the AI starts to figure out
what expression would correspond

10:16.032 --> 10:19.910
to one that exists
from the library of faces.

10:19.994 --> 10:23.456
<i>And so it's actually replacing</i>
<i>the face that you photographed</i>

10:23.539 --> 10:26.542
<i>with a photoreal image</i>
<i>that it's picking out and matching up.</i>

10:27.001 --> 10:29.045
<i>And so, by matching all those things up,</i>

10:29.128 --> 10:33.841
<i>it creates the illusion that you're seeing</i>
<i>this younger version moving around,</i>

10:33.924 --> 10:35.301
<i>but you're seeing photographs</i>

10:35.384 --> 10:39.430
<i>that are cherry-picked</i>
<i>by this incredibly robust algorithm</i>

10:39.513 --> 10:43.601
that's pulling in
the proper eyeline or expression

10:44.185 --> 10:46.062
<i>from the library of faces.</i>

10:46.145 --> 10:48.814
<i>So we were looking</i>
<i>at all three of these techniques.</i>

10:50.191 --> 10:54.737
Jon was really interested in,
"Where is the technology right now?"

10:54.820 --> 10:58.282
<i>And so he had Landis Fields</i>
<i>locked away in my office,</i>

10:58.616 --> 11:02.411
<i>like his own skunkworks,</i>
<i>kicking the tires on Deepfake.</i>

11:02.495 --> 11:04.080
<i>"Let's see how far we can push this."</i>

11:04.163 --> 11:07.333
<i>"Is there a version of Deepfake</i>
<i>that makes it into the show?"</i>

11:07.416 --> 11:09.502
<i>"Is that how we find the likeness?"</i>

11:11.212 --> 11:15.883
Landis is a brilliant art director,
designer, modeler,

11:15.966 --> 11:18.803
and a kind of mad scientist.

11:19.553 --> 11:22.932
He's exactly the kind of person
that we love at ILM.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.226
KELLER:<i> We locked him in a room,</i>
<i>I'm serious.</i>

11:25.309 --> 11:28.604
We locked him in a room
for privacy and secrecy reasons

11:28.688 --> 11:31.065
and he just sat at his machine, Landis,

11:31.148 --> 11:34.610
and just doing this,
literally, all day long. All day long.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.238
And he's got like a command center setup,

11:37.321 --> 11:40.700
<i>running Deepfake tests over and over</i>
<i>and over and over again.</i>

11:40.783 --> 11:42.243
Anybody can download this software

11:42.326 --> 11:45.579
<i>and anybody can have a go at making</i>
<i>these kind of Deepfake images.</i>

11:45.663 --> 11:46.872
<i>Once you have the software,</i>

11:46.956 --> 11:51.585
you have to provide it the information
it needs to rebuild the face.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.130
<i>So, in the instance of Mark Hamill,</i>

11:54.213 --> 11:56.966
<i>we put in a lot of footage</i>
<i>from the original movies.</i>

11:57.425 --> 12:01.512
We obviously have access
to the 4K version of the show,

12:01.595 --> 12:03.848
so we fed it
as much information as we can.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.767
<i>Because it was the first time</i>
<i>we used this particular technique,</i>

12:06.851 --> 12:10.229
<i>we also went online</i>
<i>and found interviews that Mark gave.</i>

12:10.312 --> 12:12.898
<i>Anything we could find</i>
<i>to build up the data</i>

12:12.982 --> 12:15.276
<i>that was gonna be used to provide a face.</i>

12:15.359 --> 12:19.405
We can't go back in time
and reshoot Luke the way we want,

12:19.488 --> 12:24.785
<i>so we were having to pull</i>
<i>very specific source footage.</i>

12:25.369 --> 12:27.705
There was a moment
I even scoured the Internet

12:27.788 --> 12:30.624
and found older interviews
and that of Mark Hamill,

12:30.708 --> 12:32.626
that were lit really well.

12:32.710 --> 12:36.714
So, you know, there was a lot of things
that we were paying attention to.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.341
You have to have a lot of trust
in all the technicians

12:39.425 --> 12:41.886
that they're gonna
make you look all right.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.181
BLUFF: <i>With what Deepfake technology</i>
<i>was at that point,</i>

12:45.264 --> 12:48.559
it was felt as though
we really needed to rely

12:48.642 --> 12:50.644
<i>a bit more</i>
<i>on the tried and true techniques</i>

12:50.728 --> 12:52.104
<i>rather than Deepfake.</i>

12:52.188 --> 12:56.317
So we wanted to really kinda focus in
on the de-ageing process.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.238
I had had some experience
with de-ageing technology

13:01.322 --> 13:02.323
on the <i>Ant-Man</i> movies.

13:02.406 --> 13:05.159
In the first <i>Ant-Man,</i>
we de-aged Michael Douglas

13:05.242 --> 13:08.037
<i>from basically 70 to 40 years old.</i>

13:08.120 --> 13:13.125
<i>And in the second one, we did Michael,</i>
<i>Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne.</i>

13:13.209 --> 13:15.044
<i>There was a company called Lola</i>

13:15.127 --> 13:17.713
<i>who had done</i>
<i>most of this de-ageing technology,</i>

13:17.797 --> 13:20.508
so we reached out to Lola
and talked to them about it

13:20.591 --> 13:22.885
and had them on stage
supervising all of this.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.554
TRENT CLAUS: <i>We had two actors.</i>
<i>We had Mark Hamill,</i>

13:25.638 --> 13:27.640
<i>and we also had</i>
<i>a picture double named Max.</i>

13:27.723 --> 13:29.975
And we shot both on set,

13:30.059 --> 13:33.312
<i>and we had also shot Max previously</i>
<i>with all of the cast.</i>

13:33.395 --> 13:35.356
FAVREAU: <i>Casting him was a whole thing too</i>

13:35.439 --> 13:37.817
because we had to work
with Sarah Finn and say,

13:37.900 --> 13:39.568
"Look, we want to find somebody

13:39.652 --> 13:42.154
<i>"who physically resembles</i>
<i>what Mark looked like</i>

13:42.238 --> 13:43.739
<i>"right after</i> Return of the Jedi."

13:43.823 --> 13:47.785
You couldn't just put out a casting call,
so we created a whole list of people

13:47.868 --> 13:50.204
that she knew of that could be right,

13:50.287 --> 13:53.791
<i>and we ended up</i>
<i>reading him for a different role</i>

13:53.874 --> 13:57.294
<i>and then telling him what it was,</i>
<i>and he was a great partner in that.</i>

13:57.378 --> 14:00.422
I think, on that rehearsal,
you were a bit to the right.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.424
-I'd love to get you in the center.
-Dead center.

14:02.508 --> 14:06.512
We'd watch each other do the scenes,
so we tried to match each other.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.515
<i>I would look at the monitor</i>
<i>and, of course, the image is small,</i>

14:09.598 --> 14:13.018
<i>but I thought, "Oh, my gosh,</i>
<i>he looks more like me than me."</i>

14:13.102 --> 14:16.230
It was just uncanny, this guy.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.898
<i>And he's a good actor.</i>

14:17.982 --> 14:20.734
What I think is more magical than the tech

14:20.818 --> 14:26.073
is seeing Mark trying to teach someone
to be a younger version of himself.

14:26.156 --> 14:30.578
<i>If you really remove all of the tools</i>
<i>and all of the processes away from that,</i>

14:30.661 --> 14:32.872
<i>it's a very beautiful, endearing thing.</i>

14:32.955 --> 14:33.956
LUKE: Come, little one.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.585
BLUFF:<i> I desperately wanted to have</i>
<i>a conversation with myself,</i>

14:37.668 --> 14:40.921
a seven-year-old boy
that I think is still inside me,

14:41.005 --> 14:42.923
to remind myself, just think about

14:43.007 --> 14:44.800
where you are right now,
what you're seeing.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.844
<i>Maybe it's the English person inside me,</i>

14:46.927 --> 14:49.138
<i>which is that</i>
<i>professionalism was still there.</i>

14:49.221 --> 14:52.308
I didn't have my photograph
taken with him or go over and say

14:52.391 --> 14:53.559
"I was the biggest fan", but...

14:53.642 --> 14:56.228
Deep down in everybody
that's what we were all feeling.

14:58.522 --> 15:02.359
Okay. Look who returns
and they're headed down the corridor.

15:02.443 --> 15:06.322
CLAUS: <i>So, when we shot Mark,</i>
<i>we shot him on the set</i>

15:06.405 --> 15:10.409
<i>of the bridge of the Imperial</i>
<i>light cruiser in the Volume</i>

15:10.492 --> 15:13.329
and let him drive that performance.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.205
And immediately following that,

15:15.289 --> 15:19.710
we walked him over to our lighting rig,
which we call the Egg,

15:20.336 --> 15:23.339
<i>and basically recreated</i>
<i>everything that he had just done</i>

15:23.422 --> 15:29.386
<i>But doing that separately allows us to get</i>
<i>ultra-high resolution textures of his face</i>

15:29.470 --> 15:32.848
and have ultimate control
over very technical things

15:32.932 --> 15:35.851
involved with lighting
and positioning and timing.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.520
<i>So then we can take</i>
<i>both of those performances,</i>

15:38.604 --> 15:40.814
<i>the one on set and the one in the Egg,</i>

15:40.898 --> 15:43.859
<i>and use both of them</i>
<i>to achieve the final result.</i>

15:46.904 --> 15:51.533
<i>The Egg itself is a assemblage</i>
<i>of thousands of little LED lights</i>

15:51.617 --> 15:53.744
<i>that we have control over and can animate.</i>

15:53.827 --> 15:55.829
<i>We can set lighting to match on set.</i>

15:55.913 --> 15:57.873
<i>We can add interactive lighting,</i>

15:57.957 --> 16:01.210
so it's not that dissimilar
from the Volume itself.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.879
KELLER:<i> We would do a take,</i>
<i>we would do a line.</i>

16:04.338 --> 16:08.384
<i>And then we would go through the dailies</i>
<i>and actually live cut it into an edit</i>

16:08.467 --> 16:13.472
where Jon and Dave and Peyton
could make a select on a line delivery.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.643
<i>And then from that, we would start</i>
<i>giving it over to Lola and Trent at Lola.</i>

16:17.726 --> 16:19.603
<i>And they would program it into the Egg,</i>

16:19.687 --> 16:22.314
so as we were shooting,
they were doing circle-takes

16:22.398 --> 16:24.024
and feeding the Egg at the same time.

16:24.858 --> 16:27.111
<i>We had to do this whole thing in one day.</i>

16:27.695 --> 16:30.656
<i>One day with Mark, one day with the Egg,</i>

16:31.365 --> 16:34.702
was a very long day
as you can probably imagine.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.121
Part of the secrecy too, right?

16:37.204 --> 16:41.000
Anybody that doesn't need to be up here?
If we could clear, thank you.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.169
BLUFF:<i> Even when we'd be shooting</i>
<i>with these characters on set,</i>

16:44.253 --> 16:47.172
<i>most of the company</i>
<i>would be on location at Simi Valley</i>

16:47.256 --> 16:48.674
<i>for Robert Rodriguez's episode.</i>

16:48.757 --> 16:52.720
And so, the shooting crew that was gonna
be kept behind for the moment

16:52.803 --> 16:54.972
when Mark Hamill walked on set

16:55.055 --> 16:59.226
<i>was gonna be the smallest possible team</i>
<i>we needed to get the work done.</i>

16:59.309 --> 17:02.688
<i>To give us the best chance possible</i>
<i>to keep this secret.</i>

17:02.771 --> 17:06.066
HAMILL: <i>I said to the guys,</i>
<i>"You don't have any worries from me.</i>

17:06.150 --> 17:09.069
"I've learned a long time ago
how to keep a secret.

17:09.153 --> 17:12.364
"That <i>Empire</i> secret,
I had to keep it for a year and a half."

17:12.448 --> 17:14.366
But that's before social media.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.787
I said, "All it takes is one person
in a lab, treating the film,

17:18.871 --> 17:24.918
"color correction, there's just
so many variables and so many unknowns.

17:25.002 --> 17:29.882
"One person who sees that
and goes on social media, goes,

17:29.965 --> 17:31.216
"'Guess what I saw today.'"

17:31.300 --> 17:32.634
BLUFF:<i> It was one of those times</i>

17:32.718 --> 17:35.929
<i>when everybody was biting their nails</i>
<i>right to the bitter end.</i>

17:36.013 --> 17:38.849
<i>Every day, to be honest,</i>
<i>before the episode aired,</i>

17:38.932 --> 17:41.602
<i>folks would kinda google online,</i>
"The Mandalorian,"

17:41.685 --> 17:44.730
just to see whatever
the latest information was out there.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.774
<i>Double checking that the one character</i>

17:46.857 --> 17:50.069
that we knew we had to keep secret
was not gonna get leaked.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.488
FAVREAU: <i>Everybody knew that Rosario</i>
<i>was gonna be Ahsoka.</i>

17:52.571 --> 17:55.574
<i>Everybody knew that Temuera</i>
<i>was gonna be Boba.</i>

17:55.657 --> 17:57.910
Everything leaked,
we didn't announce anything.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.496
But little by little, leaks spring,

18:00.579 --> 18:04.541
and you want the ship to get back to
the harbor before the whole thing is done.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.293
REED:<i> We had to keep Mark a secret.</i>

18:06.376 --> 18:08.712
<i>That went</i>
<i>from creating misleads in the script,</i>

18:08.796 --> 18:11.381
<i>creating art work that was not Luke,</i>

18:11.465 --> 18:15.302
creating some temporary visual effects
that were the character of Plo Koon.

18:19.056 --> 18:22.893
It's fairly well known by deep core fans
that Plo Koon's my favorite Jedi.

18:23.310 --> 18:28.649
(CLEARS THROAT) And a lot of people,
if Plo Koon from the script got out,

18:28.732 --> 18:33.153
would assume, "Well, of course,
'cause Dave likes Plo Koon."

18:33.237 --> 18:36.698
So there's these layers of intrigue
that we try to weave.

18:36.782 --> 18:42.121
We had a digital Plo Koon head
placed on the actor in dailies.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.705
So it looked like Plo Koon.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.250
In the first season,
Jon was able to successfully

18:46.333 --> 18:50.087
keep Grogu a secret, but was revealed
at the end of the first episode.

18:50.170 --> 18:53.423
Second season, we had to make it
through the entire season

18:53.507 --> 18:57.010
to the end of the last episode
and not have this spoiled.

18:57.094 --> 19:00.514
<i>In hindsight, it's a bit</i>
<i>of a miracle that it remained a secret,</i>

19:00.597 --> 19:01.807
<i>and I'm thrilled</i>

19:01.890 --> 19:06.395
because for people to be able to
discover that in real time was magical.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.690
BLUFF:<i> I remember the first time</i>
<i>we all crowded into the editing room</i>

19:09.773 --> 19:10.941
<i>once Peyton had a rough cut.</i>

19:11.024 --> 19:14.903
There was about seven of us
and six folks had tears in their eyes.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.156
It was spectacular.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.366
And then, the realization was,

19:20.325 --> 19:23.495
"Oh, boy, this really works.
We've now gotta change his face."

19:23.579 --> 19:25.706
<i>Only now would we realize what it is...</i>

19:25.789 --> 19:28.917
<i>The responsibility we have</i>
<i>to make this moment work,</i>

19:29.001 --> 19:31.461
once we do the visual effects.
It was frightening.

19:31.545 --> 19:32.671
(LAUGHS)

19:32.754 --> 19:37.259
REED: <i>This is a character that people have</i>
<i>over a 40-year relationship with, right?</i>

19:37.342 --> 19:41.471
<i>There is an emotion that just comes</i>
<i>out of seeing that character again.</i>

19:41.555 --> 19:44.183
Certainly seeing that character
show up in this show.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.601
And also for fans...

19:45.684 --> 19:48.437
You know, I was 13
when the original <i>Star Wars</i> opened,

19:48.520 --> 19:50.731
so I grew up with <i>Star Wars.</i>

19:50.814 --> 19:54.651
And there was always that fanboy
part of me that wanted to see,

19:54.735 --> 19:58.447
"What's he like in full, peak-Jedi mode
<i>post-Return of the Jedi?"</i>

19:58.530 --> 19:59.698
<i>We had a chance to do that.</i>

19:59.781 --> 20:02.743
There should be some injury,
and then it's the Force...

20:02.826 --> 20:04.328
(IMITATING CRACKLING NOISES)

20:05.746 --> 20:07.456
HAMILL: <i>I remember</i>
<i>joking with George, I said,</i>

<i>"You know, when</i> Return of The Jedi <i>ends,</i>
<i>it's all over for me."</i>

20:12.211 --> 20:17.257
And that would almost be like
taking three movies to tell you

20:17.341 --> 20:22.262
how James Bond earned his license to kill.
And then it's over.

20:22.346 --> 20:25.724
No <i>Dr. No,</i> no <i>Goldfinger,</i>
no <i>From Russia with Love.</i>

20:25.807 --> 20:27.517
<i>And I was joking, really,</i>

20:27.601 --> 20:30.354
<i>but it did occur to me</i>
<i>that he went from a farm boy,</i>

20:30.437 --> 20:32.814
<i>then to a trainee to a Jedi.</i>

20:32.898 --> 20:39.029
And yet, then it's over, and there's no
tales of his exploits as a Jedi.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.865
So, it was nice to have a rare look

20:41.949 --> 20:47.537
at what he would be doing
prior to establishing the Jedi Academy,

20:47.621 --> 20:49.289
<i>but post Jedi.</i>

20:49.373 --> 20:51.667
This last hallway,
it's the crescendo, right?

20:51.750 --> 20:55.545
So, we've now seen on every deck,
him moving through.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.838
FILONI: <i>We had a discussion</i>

20:56.922 --> 21:02.844
about it would be very easy to just
make him so over-the-top skilled,

21:02.928 --> 21:06.807
but I was like, "You know,
what's interesting is, he's had training,

21:06.890 --> 21:09.810
<i>"but I don't know who's been</i>
<i>teaching him sword-fight training."</i>

21:09.893 --> 21:14.815
<i>So, he had to have a style that was better</i>
<i>than what we saw in</i> Jedi,

21:15.232 --> 21:19.987
<i>but fundamentally still of the same tree</i>
<i>of sword-fighting technique.</i>

21:20.070 --> 21:22.990
<i>And his technique and Ahsoka's technique</i>
<i>should be very different.</i>

21:23.073 --> 21:26.493
And technically, she's had
vastly more training than he ever has.

21:26.576 --> 21:29.496
She's his senior,

21:29.579 --> 21:31.957
'cause of when these characters
were created.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.169

I knew it as I was an usher in the movie
theater when it was playing.

21:42.592 --> 21:43.593
I saw it a lot.

21:43.677 --> 21:47.055
Interestingly, the Luke costume from <i>Jedi</i>
is not the color you think it is.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.600
<i>We have to make decisions like,</i>
<i>"It's really brown, but it looks black."</i>

21:50.684 --> 21:53.562
There's something
very dramatic about this.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.773
FAVREAU: <i>Part of it was,</i>
<i>"Well, it should look black."</i>

21:56.857 --> 22:00.777
<i>The reason they went with that costume</i>
<i>was to create some moral ambiguity</i>

22:00.861 --> 22:02.571
<i>whether he had turned to the dark side,</i>

22:02.654 --> 22:05.657
<i>with him doing a bit of</i>
<i>a Force choke on the Gamorreans.</i>

22:05.741 --> 22:09.953
That's a part of the story of Luke,
which isn't part of the story for us.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.331
But if we didn't have that look,

22:12.414 --> 22:15.417
it would deviate
from people's collective memory

22:15.500 --> 22:18.086
<i>of what Luke Skywalker</i>
<i>looks like at that moment.</i>

22:18.170 --> 22:20.422
<i>So, there's a million little</i>
<i>conversations we had.</i>

22:20.505 --> 22:23.800
<i>And fortunately, Peyton Reed's a huge fan,</i>
<i>Dave's a huge fan,</i>

22:23.884 --> 22:27.220
and so we all kind of look at photos,
and then we make decisions together.

22:27.304 --> 22:31.558
And go down. Is it like a downward motion
or just that fist?

22:31.641 --> 22:33.393
-MAN: I think it's just the fist. Yeah.
-Okay.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.944
What makes Luke, Luke?
What expressions make Luke, Luke?

22:43.028 --> 22:45.113
What lighting scenarios make Luke, Luke?

22:45.197 --> 22:47.741
It's really interesting
if you look at the footage.

22:47.824 --> 22:51.495
<i>In every scene, in every shot,</i>
<i>he looks a little bit different.</i>

22:51.578 --> 22:53.663
<i>And when you start getting down to it</i>

22:53.747 --> 22:56.958
<i>and you analyze his cheek shape</i>
<i>or his nose shape,</i>

22:57.042 --> 23:00.170
he's the same person,
but in different lighting scenarios,

23:00.253 --> 23:03.632
<i>it can definitely read differently.</i>

23:03.715 --> 23:05.258
BLUFF: <i>In Jabba's palace,</i>

23:05.342 --> 23:08.678
<i>with some very stark lighting on him,</i>
<i>he looks a particular way.</i>

23:08.762 --> 23:11.598
<i>And then he's on Endor</i>
<i>and he's hanging upside down</i>

23:11.681 --> 23:14.101
<i>when the Ewoks have captured him,</i>
<i>he looks very different.</i>

23:14.184 --> 23:18.939
So, if you line up all the likeness
of Luke across all those movies,

23:19.022 --> 23:20.690
<i>people will point to different images</i>

23:20.774 --> 23:23.985
<i>as to what their version of Luke</i>
<i>in their mind looks like.</i>

23:24.069 --> 23:26.947
That was the same
when we were doing the work.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.741
We would look at something,
whether it was a haircut,

23:29.825 --> 23:31.827
whether it was a pose,
whether it was a smile,

23:31.910 --> 23:33.745
<i>or a glint in his character's eye.</i>

23:33.829 --> 23:38.542
<i>And people had a different impression of,</i>
<i>"Is the likeness on-target?"</i>

23:38.625 --> 23:41.294
And so, we would experiment
with different things.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.214
We would change the hair,
we would put it over the ears,

23:44.297 --> 23:47.092
we would have it fall
further behind his neck.

23:47.175 --> 23:50.929
We would change his neck size,
bring his collar up, his shoulders down.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.889
<i>And all of this is to test.</i>

23:52.973 --> 23:56.768
To see when do we go too far.
When does the likeness stop?

23:56.852 --> 24:03.525
Digital faces are the most difficult
visual effect in the entire world.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.236
And it's not just
because it's technically hard

24:06.319 --> 24:08.613
or the technology is still emerging.

24:08.697 --> 24:12.284
It's because every human
is an expert in faces.

24:12.367 --> 24:17.289
<i>There's something so magical</i>
<i>and innate about the human face.</i>

24:17.372 --> 24:23.879
And everybody has a point of view
on how to read a human face.

24:23.962 --> 24:28.300
And then you add on top of it,
such a recognizable human face

24:28.383 --> 24:32.095
<i>that means so much to so many people.</i>

24:32.846 --> 24:34.681
May the Force be with you.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.269
Every aspect of this is important.

24:39.352 --> 24:43.982
The build-up of X-wing, to lightsaber,
to lightsaber color, to fighting style,

24:44.065 --> 24:46.401
<i>to outside the door with the cloak,</i>
<i>to reveal,</i>

24:46.485 --> 24:49.279
<i>builds the anticipation</i>
<i>that says, "I want this."</i>

24:49.863 --> 24:52.616
<i>When you want this</i>
<i>'cause you're bought in as the audience,</i>

24:52.699 --> 24:56.119
then the face and the voice
are gonna work better, right?

24:56.203 --> 24:58.872
And suddenly you have this fusion moment

24:58.955 --> 25:02.876
where the wish fulfillment
meets the expectation of the story,

25:02.959 --> 25:06.171
<i>what it's telling, and it's just ballistic</i>
<i>and it all happens.</i>

25:06.254 --> 25:12.010
<i>But if any one of those things fails,</i>
<i>it's gonna derail the rest of it.</i>

25:13.053 --> 25:17.474
You know, I think people focus
on one thing and say, "Well, the face..."

25:17.557 --> 25:21.186
Okay, but it's probably
a lot of other things

25:21.269 --> 25:23.271
that are making the buy-in work or not.

25:23.563 --> 25:26.107
FAVREAU: <i>That's the first time</i>
<i>in that last episode</i>

25:26.191 --> 25:28.568
<i>that we actually hear any music</i>

25:28.652 --> 25:31.071
<i>that's from the original trilogy.</i>

25:31.154 --> 25:33.073
<i>(BINARY SUNSET</i> PLAYING)

25:41.456 --> 25:42.749
THE MANDALORIAN: Are you a Jedi?

25:44.042 --> 25:45.043
I am.

25:46.419 --> 25:50.131
Everything up to that point
had been original music by Ludwig.

25:50.215 --> 25:54.302
And that's the first time
you could hear any John Williams music.

25:55.011 --> 26:00.475
And that also... Let's never underestimate
the importance of John Williams.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.601
(CHUCKLES)

26:02.394 --> 26:05.355
<i>Because that's part</i>
<i>of what makes</i> Star Wars, Star Wars.

26:05.438 --> 26:09.693
<i>And so, for us to not use</i>
<i>any of those themes for any of the show</i>

26:09.776 --> 26:14.030
<i>and then to use it at this point,</i>
<i>it's saving a very powerful tool</i>

26:14.114 --> 26:17.117
<i>that I think all those things</i>
<i>help to sell the visual effect.</i>

26:17.701 --> 26:19.744
THE MANDALORIAN:
He doesn't want to go with you.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.205
He wants your permission.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.334
You know, many years ago,
I think it was 1993,

26:26.418 --> 26:31.172
I was directing a making-of documentary
for <i>Forrest Gump</i> with Robert Zemeckis.

26:31.256 --> 26:35.135
ILM at that time was doing
stuff where they made JFK talk

26:35.218 --> 26:39.347
and President Johnson, and people
Forrest Gump meets along the way.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.225
I remember, Ken Ralston and Bob Zemeckis,

26:42.309 --> 26:46.146
all the visual effects people
who were working on that movie

26:46.229 --> 26:48.690
having that very conversation
in the early '90s,

26:48.773 --> 26:51.776
about, like, this is really, you know...

26:51.860 --> 26:54.863
"We're just sort of starting
to crack this technology

26:54.946 --> 26:56.698
"in a kind of remedial way."

26:57.365 --> 27:00.452
But there's gonna come a point
where it'll be so sophisticated

27:00.535 --> 27:04.581
that, you know, it could certainly
be used in really bad ways.

27:04.664 --> 27:08.668
KNOLL: <i>Well, a tool is neither</i>
<i>good nor bad in and of itself.</i>

27:08.752 --> 27:11.921
<i>It's kind of</i>
<i>how the artist wields the tool</i>

27:12.005 --> 27:16.718
and, you know,
we try to apply ethics to what we do,

27:16.801 --> 27:19.763
where we're only
using these tools for good.

27:20.221 --> 27:23.558
FAVREAU: <i>Much like</i>
<i>in</i> The Sorcerer's Apprentice <i>in</i> Fantasia,

27:23.642 --> 27:26.686
<i>you have a new technology</i>
<i>available to you,</i>

27:26.770 --> 27:29.022
<i>just as Mickey had the magic book.</i>

27:29.105 --> 27:30.523
<i>That magic book allowed him</i>

27:30.607 --> 27:33.610
<i>to have the mops carry the buckets</i>
<i>and do the work for him.</i>

27:33.693 --> 27:35.487
<i>And every technology is like that,</i>

27:35.570 --> 27:38.657
<i>and there are unintended consequences</i>
<i>with new innovations</i>

27:38.740 --> 27:42.786
if you don't fully appreciate
what these things are capable of.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.663
I think in the case of Deepfake,

27:44.746 --> 27:47.248
<i>you know, as we're exploring</i>
<i>these different technologies</i>

27:47.332 --> 27:49.626
<i>to make Luke Skywalker</i>
<i>look young for a story</i>

27:49.709 --> 27:52.587
we couldn't tell any other way,
and we're telling you how we do it,

27:52.671 --> 27:54.881
showing you this is stuff
we didn't develop,

27:54.964 --> 27:56.800
this is stuff that's available, readily,

27:56.883 --> 28:00.720
it sort of is a reminder
that it might be used for purposes

28:00.804 --> 28:03.556
that are more misleading
and more detrimental.

28:04.307 --> 28:07.560
And what's nice about doing this
is we could point to it and say,

28:07.644 --> 28:11.815
"Well, we still have a few years
before it really gets indistinguishable."

28:11.898 --> 28:15.151
But it will get to a point
where you can't tell them apart.

28:16.027 --> 28:20.573
And it made us think about it,
because when you know it's there,

28:20.657 --> 28:22.826
it's kind of fun
and a point of discussion.

28:22.909 --> 28:26.621
But something people didn't realize
is that his voice isn't real.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.832
His voice, the young Luke Skywalker voice,

28:28.915 --> 28:34.295
is completely synthesized
using an application called Respeecher.

28:34.379 --> 28:38.216
It's a neural network you feed
information into and it learns.

28:38.299 --> 28:40.760
<i>So I had archival material</i>
<i>from Mark in that era.</i>

28:40.844 --> 28:43.596
<i>We had clean recorded ADR</i>
<i>from the original films,</i>

28:43.680 --> 28:45.890
<i>a book on tape he'd done from those eras,</i>

28:45.974 --> 28:49.519
<i>and then also</i> Star Wars <i>radio plays</i>
<i>he had done back in that time.</i>

28:49.602 --> 28:52.689
I was able to get clean recordings
of that, feed it into the system,

28:52.772 --> 28:56.401
they were able to slice it up and feed
their neural network to learn this data.

28:56.484 --> 29:01.948
The computer is sampling sounds and tones
from younger Mark Hamill

29:02.031 --> 29:06.286
and creating a performance
that sounds like that Luke Skywalker.

29:06.369 --> 29:07.954
LUKE: He is strong with the Force.

29:08.955 --> 29:11.166
But talent without training is nothing.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.918
You know, it makes you realize
that it becomes harder

29:14.002 --> 29:16.463
to trust your eyes and ears
when it comes to this stuff.

29:16.546 --> 29:19.632
And, so... I mean, the good news
is that technology is probably...

29:19.716 --> 29:23.052
You know, technology is not going away,
in any event.

29:23.136 --> 29:25.638
But other people
who understand technology,

29:25.722 --> 29:27.223
if we can anticipate these things...

29:27.307 --> 29:30.894
<i>Even now, there's blockchain technology,</i>
<i>like we talk about chain codes.</i>

29:30.977 --> 29:34.105
My chain code has been encoded
in this armor for 25 years.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.067
You see, this is me. Boba Fett.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.861
FAVREAU: <i>We were alluding to that there's</i>

29:39.944 --> 29:42.655
<i>a blockchain identification</i>
<i>that everybody has.</i>

29:42.739 --> 29:47.577
I wonder if certain images or videos
that are released in official capacity

29:47.660 --> 29:49.412
could have some kind of a stamp with it.

29:49.496 --> 29:52.499
Something... When you see something,
that you know it's real.

29:52.582 --> 29:55.919
Because it's becoming harder
to tell fake from real.

29:56.002 --> 29:59.130
And if we know that, we have
the technology that could address that.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.091
Now, having tokens that are associated,

30:02.175 --> 30:06.554
that have, "Where does this image
come from?" Built into the blockchain.

30:06.638 --> 30:10.266
"How has it been edited or changed?
When was it created?"

30:10.767 --> 30:16.105
Those are identifiers that don't require
a database or a central governing body.

30:16.189 --> 30:19.692
However, if the big tech companies
got together and say,

30:19.776 --> 30:23.279
"Come up with a standard of verification,"
they do it in social media.

30:23.363 --> 30:27.700
I know if somebody's giving a real quote
as they're verified with a blue checkmark,

30:27.784 --> 30:29.869
if they're somebody
who's of social consequence,

30:29.953 --> 30:32.288
that they've deemed
somebody they would verify.

30:32.372 --> 30:36.042
And like in <i>Fantasia,</i>
when the wizard comes in

30:36.125 --> 30:42.632
<i>and he's able to undo the things</i>
<i>that Mickey did in his haste.</i>

30:43.299 --> 30:46.344
<i>And because he was</i>
<i>engaging with technologies,</i>

30:46.427 --> 30:50.390
<i>or, in this case, magic, that he didn't</i>
<i>understand the full ramifications of.</i>

30:50.473 --> 30:51.474
The good news is

30:51.558 --> 30:55.103
we have all these wonderful technologies
available to us to tell stories.

30:55.186 --> 30:56.312
Only gonna get better.

30:56.396 --> 31:00.275
Part of our responsibility,
you guys and me,

31:00.358 --> 31:04.779
is to keep an eye on that
and see how we can help

31:04.863 --> 31:09.742
maximize the benefit while diminishing
or eliminating the downside.

31:13.162 --> 31:14.455
FILONI: <i>Growing up with</i> Star Wars,

31:14.539 --> 31:16.291
<i>you never think</i>
<i>you'd be a part of making it.</i>

31:16.374 --> 31:20.587
<i>For Jon, I think it's so special</i>
<i>to have a character like Grogu</i>

31:20.670 --> 31:26.426
<i>that can stand right next to R2-D2</i>
<i>in the same frame and talk to him.</i>

31:27.051 --> 31:28.970
<i>You don't ever imagine that.</i>

31:29.053 --> 31:33.933

that character next to those characters.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.691
<i>We were talking about the scene,</i>
<i>getting into it,</i>

31:41.774 --> 31:45.028
<i>and I said, "Well, if we bring</i>
<i>Luke in, you get Artoo."</i>

31:45.111 --> 31:47.989
And Jon was like, "Artoo."

31:48.072 --> 31:49.991
My favorite character when I was little.

31:50.074 --> 31:54.412
Oh, my God... They didn't even have
toys of him. Had the little figures.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.456
If I could have a radio-control one

31:56.539 --> 31:58.833
like they have now,
I would've lost my mind.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.085
FILONI: <i>You know that you see</i>
<i>someone's inner child,</i>

32:01.169 --> 32:06.841
and I saw in Jon, I saw in him that
young person that first saw <i>Star Wars.</i>

32:06.925 --> 32:10.762
It was right there in front of me
when I mentioned Artoo.

32:10.845 --> 32:17.101
<i>And so I immediately did a sketch</i>
<i>of Artoo talking to Grogu.</i>

32:17.185 --> 32:18.937
<i>And I was like, "The moment we want</i>

32:19.020 --> 32:21.773
<i>"is the one that's</i>
<i>like when Wicket meets Artoo."</i>

32:21.856 --> 32:23.274
(R2-D2 BLEEPING)

32:23.358 --> 32:27.362
In post, we reanimated his little lights.
That was a lot of fun, actually.

32:27.445 --> 32:30.073
<i>For his lens that's right in front</i>
<i>that moves around,</i>

32:30.156 --> 32:33.076
gives you an indication of his mood
and what he's thinking,

32:33.159 --> 32:37.705
we took an animation
directly from <i>Return of the Jedi</i>

32:37.789 --> 32:41.417
and reanimated it for the scene
and got to put it in there.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.879
So we got to use some <i>Return of the Jedi</i>
directly on Artoo.

<i>My God, here's Mark Hamill</i>
<i>dressed as Luke Skywalker,</i>

<i>on our set in a starship hallway.</i>

32:57.809 --> 33:00.895
It was just... It felt like a dream.
It was very strange.

33:00.979 --> 33:04.232
And I was fine. And then R2-D2 rolled on.

33:04.857 --> 33:07.527
<i>And I just had a moment</i>
<i>where R2-D2 was there</i>

33:07.610 --> 33:10.029
<i>and I... That's when I broke down.</i>

33:10.113 --> 33:13.449
And it felt... I didn't understand
why it felt silly, you know?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.618
But I started tearing up.

33:16.285 --> 33:18.663
And I was like,
"Let me remember this moment."

33:18.746 --> 33:20.206
Uh, even now, I'm sort of moved.

33:20.289 --> 33:22.417
But I don't understand why,
I really don't.

33:22.917 --> 33:24.293
I don't understand why.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.338
But it just shows you
how deep that stuff goes,

33:27.422 --> 33:31.175
and what it touches from your childhood
and how you felt then.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.719
For a generation of kids now,

33:32.802 --> 33:35.930
Grogu represents something
that Artoo represented to me,

33:36.014 --> 33:37.598
that Yoda represented to me.

33:37.682 --> 33:42.645
<i>It's a magic, special character</i>
<i>that we take very good care of, I hope.</i>

33:44.063 --> 33:45.773
(COOS)

33:47.817 --> 33:50.486
HAMILL: <i>The Grogu puppet is so believable.</i>

33:50.570 --> 33:54.657
Déjà vu with Yoda, you know?
I mean, Yoda was so real to me.

33:54.741 --> 33:57.744
I just thought,
when I was watching the episodes,

33:57.827 --> 34:01.956
I said, "I've got to meet the Child,"
and it's justified

34:02.040 --> 34:04.959
because I'm the only one
that has any experience

34:05.043 --> 34:06.210
with the species.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.420
THE MANDALORIAN: Hey, go on.

34:09.088 --> 34:11.549
That's who you belong with.
He's one of your kind.

34:14.427 --> 34:19.432
It was important that the end of that show
have a really strong, slow build,

34:19.515 --> 34:21.517
and build in emotion

34:21.601 --> 34:25.730
about how the audience was responding
to the appearance of that character

34:25.813 --> 34:29.484
and to the separation of Mando and Grogu.

34:30.526 --> 34:32.862
<i>I talked to Jon a lot</i>
<i>about the ending of</i> E.T.

34:32.945 --> 34:36.657
<i>The way that you spend</i>
<i>a whole movie with E.T. and Elliott.</i>

34:36.741 --> 34:40.078
And then, there's a certain point
where E.T. has to go.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.039
And that whole ending
where Spielberg goes around

34:43.122 --> 34:47.418
and you're just witnessing
the emotion between E.T. and Elliott.

34:47.502 --> 34:50.338
The emotion of E.T.'s mom and brother,
everybody in that scene,

34:50.421 --> 34:53.508
and it is all through
this amazing John Williams score.

34:53.591 --> 34:56.928
<i>I said, "We want to introduce a bit</i>
<i>of that into the</i> Star Wars <i>universe."</i>

34:57.011 --> 35:00.306
<i>Let's not be afraid</i>
<i>of that emotion at the end of the thing,</i>

35:00.389 --> 35:03.810
<i>'cause that's...</i>
<i>To me, that was the win of that episode.</i>

35:03.893 --> 35:07.230
<i>And it felt like it merited it,</i>
<i>because to split up those two characters</i>

35:07.313 --> 35:11.025
<i>at the end of that season</i>
<i>broke a lot of hearts.</i>

35:13.736 --> 35:15.947
All right, pal. It's time to go.

35:21.744 --> 35:23.037
Don't be afraid.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.666
BLUFF: <i>What was interesting</i>
<i>about watching Peyton's episode, 208,</i>

35:26.749 --> 35:28.209
<i>I was watching it with my family,</i>

35:28.292 --> 35:31.254
and so there was a little bit of a gap
in your muscle memory

35:31.337 --> 35:33.339
<i>of how the episode played out.</i>

35:34.549 --> 35:36.676
<i>I got pretty choked up watching it.</i>

35:36.759 --> 35:39.345
<i>And not only seeing the character</i>
<i>and emotion come though</i>

35:39.428 --> 35:41.305
<i>and, of course, the spectacular music,</i>

35:41.389 --> 35:45.184
<i>but I think it was</i>
<i>the finally letting go of the emotion of,</i>

35:46.310 --> 35:47.478
"Now the world knows.

35:47.562 --> 35:50.898
"Now we can let go of some
of what's been inside this whole time."

35:50.982 --> 35:54.652
And maybe I can say "Luke Skywalker"?
Maybe not. I'm not sure. (CHUCKLES)

35:57.655 --> 36:01.701
FAVREAU: <i>To see the reactions, that was</i>
<i>a high point of my whole career.</i>

36:01.784 --> 36:05.997
That was definitely on those moments
you could count on one hand,

36:06.664 --> 36:10.459
of what makes you grateful
that you're doing what you're doing,

36:11.085 --> 36:15.423
and to hear Peyton react and Dave react
and especially Mark.

36:16.090 --> 36:19.510
When Mark was seeing the stuff...
And we live in an interesting time.

36:19.594 --> 36:24.557
We live in a time when people
make their feelings known. (LAUGHS)

36:24.640 --> 36:28.186
And if you choose to,
you could dip into that river

36:28.269 --> 36:30.688
of information, of feedback.

36:31.189 --> 36:37.737
Jon sent me links to reaction videos,
which were just, you know...

36:37.820 --> 36:40.198
'Cause I don't get to
see these things in the audience.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.575
To see grown men cry.

36:42.658 --> 36:45.620
And just those people
screaming their heads off.

36:46.329 --> 36:51.918
It was really, really thrilling for me
to see them enjoying it so much.

36:55.880 --> 37:00.218
We love the fans. If it weren't for them,
I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you.

37:00.301 --> 37:03.429
They are the most loyal,
passionate group of people

37:03.512 --> 37:05.973
<i>that I've ever encountered.</i>

37:06.390 --> 37:10.895
<i>I just have a deep gratitude</i>
<i>to their enthusiasm over the years.</i>

37:10.978 --> 37:15.983
I never expected that, and it's just
been something that I really cherish.

37:19.028 --> 37:23.282
FILONI: <i>This job is great in so many ways,</i>
<i>and I think people think the job is great,</i>

37:23.366 --> 37:26.369
'cause we get to tell the story,
because we do these effects,

37:26.827 --> 37:30.414
because we get these experiences,
because we go to Celebration, right?

37:30.498 --> 37:32.625
But also great
is just standing on the side

37:32.708 --> 37:34.043
and watching somebody...

37:34.126 --> 37:37.630
Like I said, I saw the child inside Jon,
that he experienced <i>Star Wars.</i>

37:37.713 --> 37:41.926
I sit there with Peyton, you see
your crew just staring at Mark

37:42.510 --> 37:45.221
<i>and you realize they're remembering</i>
<i>what it meant to them.</i>

37:46.180 --> 37:49.141
<i>And you realize that you've been</i>
<i>a part of constructing something</i>

37:49.225 --> 37:51.018
<i>that's giving that experience to people.</i>

37:51.644 --> 37:56.691
This good feeling, which, fundamentally,
<i>Star Wars</i> should deliver a good feeling.

37:57.108 --> 38:01.279
An uplifting feeling in you
and your family, your kids, whatever.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.825
A lot of <i>Star Wars</i> fans are of this age

38:05.908 --> 38:08.786
where they're not
the Luke Skywalkers anymore.

38:08.869 --> 38:11.580
They're the parents now,
and they're saying goodbye to their kids

38:11.664 --> 38:14.083
as they go off to school
or off to college.

38:14.667 --> 38:18.087
And I think that what's nice
about a good myth and a good story

38:18.170 --> 38:19.797
and the world that George created

38:19.880 --> 38:22.425
is that there's room
for all the archetypes of every age,

38:22.508 --> 38:25.553
and I think that's part of why it becomes
an intergenerational experience.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.055
And just as my father brought me
to the first <i>Star Wars,</i>

38:28.723 --> 38:31.851
there's a lot of people
sitting on the couch with their kids.

38:31.934 --> 38:34.979
They may be watching for
different reasons, like different things.

38:35.062 --> 38:39.400
<i>But I like, you know, in this atomized</i>
<i>entertainment economy</i>

38:39.483 --> 38:42.403
<i>where everybody is looking at things</i>
<i>that are bespoke for them</i>

38:42.486 --> 38:44.322
<i>and everybody has their own log-in</i>

38:44.405 --> 38:47.366
<i>and everybody has their own platform</i>
<i>that they like to look at,</i>

38:47.450 --> 38:53.873
<i>to have a moment where you could have</i>
<i>several members of a family together,</i>

38:53.956 --> 38:57.918
watching the same thing
and sharing the same experience.

38:59.211 --> 39:02.214
That's what good television
and good movies are all about

39:02.298 --> 39:05.092
and I really... I'm very proud of that,

39:05.176 --> 39:09.472
The Mandalorian <i>has that element to it.</i>

39:10.765 --> 39:14.977
<i>And it's a great way to introduce</i>
<i>the next generation to</i> Star Wars.
