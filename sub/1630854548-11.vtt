WEBVTT

01:25.585 --> 01:27.128
[Cliff screaming]

01:29.506 --> 01:30.840
This is it!

01:30.924 --> 01:32.592
This is how we die!

01:32.675 --> 01:35.220
[Larry] I... I don't think
we can die here.

01:35.303 --> 01:38.014
Ahh! Tell it
to that motherfucker.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.390
[horse neighing]

01:40.683 --> 01:41.684
[screaming]

01:41.768 --> 01:43.812
[all screaming]

01:43.895 --> 01:45.313
Grid, deploy the pod.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.606
- [mechanical whirring]
- [clicks]

01:47.941 --> 01:50.235
Vic, you're falling apart.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.861
No.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.112
I'm holding us together.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.823
[mechanical clicking]

02:02.413 --> 02:04.499
How long has this been a thing?

02:05.208 --> 02:06.459
Roughly 24 hours.

02:07.418 --> 02:08.545
I upgraded.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.047
[Cliff] So, technically,
we're inside you?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.590
- Ugh.
- [Cliff giggles]

02:12.674 --> 02:14.801
Look, let's focus on
getting the hell out of here.

02:14.884 --> 02:18.012
[Larry] Yeah, uh,
I don't know about that.

02:18.096 --> 02:21.015
[Cliff] I'm with Larry.
What's the point of going back

02:21.099 --> 02:23.852
so Immortus can finish
putting her foot up our ass?

02:23.935 --> 02:27.230
Or so the Butts can
take a bite out of it?

02:27.313 --> 02:29.899
We don't have our longevity.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.569
We're old, useless.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.320
Expired milk.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.738
[Vic] We're not safe here.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.365
And the people back home
aren't safe

02:37.448 --> 02:39.325
so long as Immortus and
those Butts are running wild.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.327
- [voice in Jane's head]<i> Say it.</i>
- Of course you wanna go back.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.830
You're not dying.
And you've got a shiny new body to play with.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.707
- Yeah, I bet you can't wait--
- [voice grows louder]

02:45.790 --> 02:48.293
- to get back so you can pull--
- [voice]<i> Say it.</i>

02:48.376 --> 02:49.711
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

02:53.840 --> 02:54.799
Are you okay?

02:55.383 --> 02:56.384
Sorry.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.262
How's Rita doing?

02:59.345 --> 03:01.097
Wait, what about Rita?

03:01.180 --> 03:03.975
[Larry] She's the reason
we went after Immortus in the first place.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.186
Rita's dying.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.524
Then why are we even arguing?

03:11.608 --> 03:14.068
[grunts in pain] No, Keeg.
Keeg, don't.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.738
[Cliff] What the fuck!

03:16.821 --> 03:19.032
Has your glow worm
lost its mind?

03:19.115 --> 03:20.450
I don't know.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.076
Keeg, are you nuts?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.661
- What did you do out there?
- [Grid] Keeg has discovered

03:23.745 --> 03:26.331
a series of portals
within the time stream.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.790
- Who the hell is talking?
- That's Grid.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.208
My operating system.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.668
Usually, I'm the only one
that can hear it,

03:30.752 --> 03:32.045
but Keeg must have
hacked into it.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.254
You have a voice...

03:34.047 --> 03:35.798
in your head...

03:35.882 --> 03:37.550
that talks to you.

03:37.634 --> 03:41.262
[Cliff] Fuck it. That's not
even the strangest thing about him.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.306
[Larry grunts in pain]

03:43.389 --> 03:46.267
Keeg says there's longevity
located on the other side of these three portals.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.144
The longevity skin tag?

03:48.227 --> 03:51.439
As in, Immortus is waiting
on the other side to put the boot to us?

03:51.522 --> 03:54.400
No Immortus, just longevity.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.401
Keeg can sense it.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.819
[Cliff] Hey, Vic,

03:56.903 --> 03:59.113
does your new gear
come with a bullshit detector?

03:59.197 --> 04:02.700
Because mine is off the charts.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.077
[Larry] It's not bullshit.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.120
The longevity was a part
of Keeg's entire life.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.747
He knows what it feels like.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.457
What are we supposed to do?
Hurl our asses through time

04:09.540 --> 04:11.709
based on what
your kid's telling us?

04:11.793 --> 04:14.754
Isn't that how
you lost your longevity in the first place?

04:14.837 --> 04:16.881
[Larry] His heart was
in the right place.

04:16.965 --> 04:21.094
And you should know
that everyone deserves second and third chances.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.804
[Cliff] Boo.

04:22.887 --> 04:26.349
What if we get chomped on
by a T. rex. and wind up dinosaur poop?

04:26.432 --> 04:29.269
Or we end up in a future
where robots have taken over?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.312
[Cliff] That actually
sounds pretty sweet.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.814
I have a fix for that.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.399
[chuckles softly]

04:34.482 --> 04:35.358
[metallic wrenching]

04:35.441 --> 04:36.359
- [Cliff] Oh!
- Ew.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.194
- Gross.
- Okay, wow.

04:38.277 --> 04:39.445
It's part of the new me.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.115
Okay, here.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.994
Each knuckle
has Grid tech in it.

04:46.077 --> 04:48.788
I can control it and recall it
whenever I need to.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.498
So, you've all got one hour.

04:50.581 --> 04:53.251
Get in, find the longevity,

04:53.334 --> 04:54.711
and then
I'll yank you back here.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.920
[Cliff] Just to review.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.880
We're leaping into
this dumb plan

04:57.964 --> 05:00.258
based on
super spotty information,

05:00.341 --> 05:02.093
armed with nothing
but our wits,

05:02.176 --> 05:07.390
my good looks, and Vic's
creepy robotic knuckles.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.058
Pretty much, yeah.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.227
[groans]

05:12.103 --> 05:13.312
[whooshing]

05:14.731 --> 05:15.648
[dramatic music playing]

05:18.526 --> 05:20.570
I don't know if I can do this.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.363
Here, here. Hold my mitt.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.907
Oh, that is so gross.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.620
What? My mitt's
not good enough,

05:29.704 --> 05:33.332
but you'll grab on
to a used maxi pad wrapped in a trench coat?

05:33.416 --> 05:34.834
Aim for the portals.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.419
Push off hard.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.837
Give yourself some momentum.

05:39.338 --> 05:40.256
[Cliff exhales sharply]

05:44.093 --> 05:45.970
[screaming]

05:46.054 --> 05:47.346
[both yelling]

05:48.056 --> 05:49.599
[screaming]

05:53.561 --> 05:56.022
Grid, send out an SOS.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.024
Any and all frequencies.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.484
We're gonna
broadcast the message

05:59.567 --> 06:01.444
into every damn portal
in this time stream,

06:01.527 --> 06:03.404
until someone
on the other side answers.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.367
[whooshing]

06:13.581 --> 06:14.540
The Ant Farm?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.334
Really?

06:17.376 --> 06:18.836
[sighing] Oh, fuck me.

06:20.880 --> 06:21.798
[footsteps approaching]

06:24.175 --> 06:25.551
[suspenseful music playing]

06:30.932 --> 06:32.308
[softly] My, my, my.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.186
Fuck me sideways.

06:38.272 --> 06:41.984
Wow. This is
the most exciting place we could end up?

06:43.486 --> 06:45.238
At least we know where we are.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.201
Yeah, and when, ish.

06:50.284 --> 06:54.163
I think it was '96
when Niles lied to Cliff about his family dying.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.083
He went in there
and stared out the window until '04.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.711
We could tell him
Clara's alive.

07:00.795 --> 07:04.340
Except we only have
an hour to save Rita, and maybe the world.

07:05.842 --> 07:06.843
[Jane whispers] Right.

07:10.763 --> 07:11.681
Shit.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.350
Chief is here.

07:14.433 --> 07:18.312
That means we're gonna have
to get the longevity from him.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.690
[sighs] Look, the good news is,
Niles has seen it all.

07:20.773 --> 07:24.402
And I bet we're not even
the first time travelers he's ever met.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.904
Right. So, we just
stroll up to him,

07:26.988 --> 07:29.198
explain we come
from a bleak future,

07:29.282 --> 07:30.533
and... [inhales]

07:30.616 --> 07:32.368
politely ask him to hand over

07:32.451 --> 07:35.037
the one thing
he holds more sacred than any other possession.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.665
I guess.

07:37.748 --> 07:38.875
[gasps in pain]

07:38.958 --> 07:40.835
Hey, hey! Where are you going?

07:42.503 --> 07:43.629
Un-fucking-real.

07:45.131 --> 07:45.965
[softly] Okay.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.592
[Latin music playing]

07:54.307 --> 07:56.475
Tell me, barkeep.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.604
You ever had your heart
shat upon by a horse?

08:09.030 --> 08:09.989
[Niles] Kipling.

08:12.825 --> 08:13.743
I've got it.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.458
Then we should celebrate.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.586
To immortality and heartbreak.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.546
- [chuckles softly]
- You're drunk.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.841
Absolutely ossified, yeah.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.969
Von Fuchs' men
are right behind me.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.472
We need an exit strategy.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.350
You're the exit strategy.

08:37.892 --> 08:38.726
Ah.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.145
Better get you
out of here, then.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.272
First...

08:44.857 --> 08:46.317
I need to hit the head.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.276
Wait...

08:48.611 --> 08:49.737
Just hurry.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.247
[whooshing]

09:05.628 --> 09:06.545
[mysterious music playing]

09:11.592 --> 09:12.426
No.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.470
This can't be.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.640
You can't be.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.058
Let me guess.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.977
You got some sketches
of me somewhere, right?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.103
Bad idea?

09:22.186 --> 09:24.230
Until you come up
with a good idea?

09:25.231 --> 09:26.315
This isn't possible.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.234
Oh, I'm possible, jerk-off.

09:28.317 --> 09:33.072
You create me and ruin
a bunch of other lives with your experiments.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.156
- I wouldn't.
- No.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.158
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.662
We both know
what you're capable of when you get desperate enough.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.164
Will you quit speaking
as if you know me?

09:42.248 --> 09:43.499
But I do.

09:43.582 --> 09:44.667
I mean, I will.

09:45.751 --> 09:46.669
In the future.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.921
Crazy, right?

09:49.005 --> 09:52.842
Like I said, a few
decades from now, you create me.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.178
Part of the recipe
is some of that necklace you stole.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.639
And now, my clock
is running out,

09:58.723 --> 10:01.517
and I need some more
of that necklace.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.394
It's a skin tag, by the way.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.354
So, wear it in good health.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.231
You have no idea
what I've done to get it

10:07.315 --> 10:09.567
or you wouldn't be
asking me for it.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.526
You owe me!

10:11.569 --> 10:13.195
No. Cliff, Cliffy.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.698
[breathes deeply, groans]

10:15.781 --> 10:16.824
De-escalate.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.367
[exhales]

10:19.744 --> 10:21.454
Look, I know you think

10:21.537 --> 10:24.874
you need that necklace
to live one day longer than Dorothy.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.668
Dorothy.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.462
Yeah, but here's the kicker.

10:29.545 --> 10:33.549
You still croak before her
and the kid's better off without you.

10:33.632 --> 10:36.719
She's got friends.
And she's even growing up now.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.220
I mean, if I had time,

10:38.304 --> 10:41.724
we could do a deep dive
into your parenting style.

10:41.807 --> 10:45.394
You're gonna come at me
with a knife? Are you high?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.688
Who sent you? Von Fuchs?

10:47.772 --> 10:49.732
- [toilet flushing]
- The Brain?

10:49.815 --> 10:53.194
[claps] Right, who's ready
to vacate this shit box?

10:56.155 --> 10:58.866
What in the name
of good King Christ is that?

10:58.949 --> 11:01.327
Drunk Merlin is here?

11:01.410 --> 11:04.080
Fuck this!
I'm done talking.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.414
Cough it up, Chief!

11:05.498 --> 11:07.375
- [grunts]
- Waltroy!

11:07.458 --> 11:09.293
[Cliff] Fuck, I can't move.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.420
- It's 'cause I de-animated you.
- [Niles groans]

11:11.504 --> 11:14.632
[Cliff] Or it's because
I have Parkinson's disease.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.467
Yeah, that's right,
motherfuckers.

11:16.550 --> 11:19.261
Being unable to move
is basically any other Monday to me.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.098
[scoffs] Good luck
trying to pry this dick out of my hands.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.267
Keeg?

11:27.228 --> 11:28.562
- [energy warbling]
- Keeg!

11:29.146 --> 11:31.023
[panting]

11:31.107 --> 11:32.024
Keeg.

11:36.612 --> 11:37.446
Keeg!

11:39.031 --> 11:40.116
[panting]

11:40.199 --> 11:42.201
This is not the time
for games, Keeg.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.744
We need to...

11:43.828 --> 11:46.205
Oh, God. You.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.755
Keeg, get back inside, now.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.299
[electrical buzzing]

11:57.383 --> 11:58.259
[gasps in pain]

12:00.386 --> 12:01.470
No.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.055
No, you don't get
to do that anymore.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.142
Oh, you're curious?

12:06.225 --> 12:07.685
You wanna know
where I'm from? All right.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.813
I'm from the future
where you abandoned me.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.481
[warbling, chittering]

12:12.565 --> 12:13.899
Ah, he shrugs.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.276
Well, I guess you can't
feel too bad about it.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.319
It hasn't happened for you yet.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.279
[chittering]

12:20.781 --> 12:22.408
[sighs] Oh.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.326
Yeah, I'm also rapidly dying.

12:24.410 --> 12:28.456
So, things with future me
are still top shelf, in case you're wondering.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.166
- [whooshing]
- Hey, wait. Wait.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.208
Where are you...

12:33.127 --> 12:35.546
[sighs] I don't care
if you like him.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.635
And I suppose now
is as good a time as any to tell you that...

12:43.053 --> 12:43.929
that's your dad.

12:45.014 --> 12:45.890
[door opens]

12:50.269 --> 12:51.228
Holy shit.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.444
Wait.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.820
You're controlling him?

13:01.614 --> 13:02.948
I didn't know
you could do that.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.075
[voice echoing] You...

13:05.659 --> 13:06.494
need...

13:07.578 --> 13:08.496
these.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.921
- Niles?
- [door creaking]

13:22.801 --> 13:23.844
[inhales deeply]

13:25.262 --> 13:26.722
[exhales softly]

13:31.685 --> 13:32.937
[soft music playing]

13:40.611 --> 13:42.488
[voices whispering]
<i>Say it. Say it.</i>

13:44.448 --> 13:46.492
[voices continue]
<i>Say it. Say it. Say it.</i>

13:47.910 --> 13:49.411
Jane?

13:49.495 --> 13:50.913
- [voices speak indistinctly]
- [Niles] Jane!

13:50.996 --> 13:52.456
[voices stops]

13:52.540 --> 13:54.250
When did you come back?

13:54.333 --> 13:55.501
[inhales deeply]

13:56.335 --> 13:57.294
I'm not back.

14:01.840 --> 14:02.758
Not for a while.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.844
- What has happened to you?
- [clicks]

14:05.928 --> 14:06.804
[wheels whirring]

14:08.347 --> 14:09.640
We've lost our longevity.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.725
[softly] Oh.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.936
You know about longevity.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.522
We know everything
in the future.

14:18.857 --> 14:22.278
SOS. Please respond.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.405
This is Victor Stone.
Can anyone hear me?

14:25.656 --> 14:26.615
[electric static]

14:28.617 --> 14:31.704
SOS, please respond.
This is Victor Stone.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.039
Can anyone hear me?

14:34.123 --> 14:36.417
- [static continues]
- [sighs]

14:36.500 --> 14:39.670
[scoffs] Man, I'm Cyborg again
for less than 24 hours,

14:39.753 --> 14:42.506
and I'm already using
my upgrades to call for help.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.258
[Grid] You're doing
a great job, Vic.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.343
Grid! Turn off
positive reinforcements.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.304
[sighs]

14:53.183 --> 14:54.226
[mouse squeaking]

15:04.153 --> 15:05.738
[Jane]<i> Don't worry.</i>

15:05.821 --> 15:08.824
We've done all the fighting
we can about what you've done.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.703
So how about it?

15:12.786 --> 15:16.457
You wanna shave off
a little more of Immortus and save our lives?

15:17.541 --> 15:19.752
I'd love to help you, Jane.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.545
But I really can't do that.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.297
Hm.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.674
I know.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.016
[Niles] If there's anything
else I can do to help...

15:37.645 --> 15:38.604
They're all gone.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.190
[Niles] Who?

15:41.273 --> 15:42.149
The personas?

15:45.277 --> 15:46.820
What does that mean?

15:46.904 --> 15:49.031
It means
I'm getting old as fuck.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.494
And I'm losing my mind.

16:00.668 --> 16:01.919
It means I...

16:03.420 --> 16:06.757
can't form a normal
fucking relationship

16:06.840 --> 16:10.219
outside of these assholes
in this house.

16:10.302 --> 16:14.264
And I need
to figure out a puzzle...

16:14.348 --> 16:18.185
that could change
what life I have left.

16:28.654 --> 16:33.701
It means that in some weird,
fucked-up way,

16:33.784 --> 16:36.453
you might be
the best person to help me.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.879
[guitar music playing]

16:45.963 --> 16:48.173
[groans, grunts] Where the hell
are you from, anyway?

16:48.257 --> 16:51.009
[Cliff] Oh, I just got here
from fucking your mom.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.596
Apparently I create him
at some point in the future.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.765
The future?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.183
Oh, bollocks.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.768
We'll have to
flush your memories after this.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.395
You will do no such thing.

17:01.478 --> 17:04.273
Future knowledge
is a toxin, Niles.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.942
Those who possess it
are consumed by it.

17:07.025 --> 17:09.486
[Cliff] That checks out.
My buddies and I discovered a future

17:09.570 --> 17:11.321
where killer Butts
have taken over the earth--

17:11.405 --> 17:13.782
Stop talking about the future.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.952
- [Cliff] I will,
if you let me go. - No!

17:17.035 --> 17:18.829
You've done enough already.

17:18.912 --> 17:21.999
[Cliff] No, I haven't.
There are lives depending on me, Niles.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.209
People you are going
to love one day.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.879
Oh, right.
Pals, just like yourself.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.881
[Cliff] I know you think
I'm your enemy.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.424
And we're sure as shit
not pals.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.050
But I understand you now.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.678
You wanna live one day longer
than your daughter, right?

17:36.346 --> 17:38.640
Well, I have a grandson, Rory.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.143
All I want is more
time with him too.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.313
I'm not asking for a lot,
a few crumbs.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.815
That's the least
you can do for me.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.192
You owe me that much.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.112
I know what you're thinking.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.158
This robot is ancient.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.827
I've got better hardware
in my room.

17:58.911 --> 18:03.499
But Mr. Invincible
is why we're all here.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.083
Because before you can fly...

18:07.252 --> 18:09.338
you must first learn to crawl.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.633
I think it's cute.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.843
Well, Mr. Invincible might not
look like much...

18:14.927 --> 18:16.220
- [clicks]
- [whirring]

18:16.303 --> 18:18.138
But he'll surely surprise you.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.224
[Vic, distorted]
<i>SOS, please respond.</i>

18:20.307 --> 18:22.017
<i>SOS, please respond.</i>

18:23.143 --> 18:24.353
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

18:25.312 --> 18:26.355
<i>SOS.</i>

18:26.438 --> 18:27.356
[suspenseful music playing]

18:29.775 --> 18:30.609
Vic?

18:31.944 --> 18:32.778
Derick?

18:33.987 --> 18:34.905
Are you shitting me?

18:35.697 --> 18:36.740
[all laughing]

18:36.824 --> 18:38.408
Hey, yo, you're on

18:38.492 --> 18:40.244
<i>- speaker phone.</i>
- What?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.455
Look, I need help. I'm stuck.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.748
<i>I'm in the time stream.</i>

18:55.759 --> 18:56.635
[mouse squeaking]

19:13.569 --> 19:14.444
[water shifting]

19:20.993 --> 19:21.827
[whooshing]

19:22.661 --> 19:24.329
There you are.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.084
[grunts]

19:32.671 --> 19:35.090
Well, kind of hope that hurt.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.014
[knocking at door]

19:43.098 --> 19:44.016
[knocking continues]

19:49.688 --> 19:52.816
Dr. Caulder.
Sorry to startle you. I...

19:52.900 --> 19:54.401
I knocked and there
was no answer.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.112
So I assumed I could just
pop in and drop these off.

19:57.195 --> 19:58.864
Fine. Leave them and go.

19:58.947 --> 20:02.576
Yes, well, I have
more candidates for your Immortus project.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.414
Hand them here.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.132
[clicks tongue]
Yes, well, um...

20:20.093 --> 20:21.136
[softly] Go.

20:21.219 --> 20:22.554
Sorry to interrupt again.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.099
Actually, you know,
that's not all.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.601
I... [inhales deeply]

20:27.684 --> 20:30.604
I know you don't
think much of me or my methods,

20:30.687 --> 20:33.023
but I want you
to know that I...

20:33.106 --> 20:37.027
[sighs] I respect your work,
and I'm...

20:37.110 --> 20:40.614
I truly believe that I would be
a great asset to you.

20:40.697 --> 20:41.990
Ms. De Mille--

20:42.074 --> 20:43.325
If only someone would
just take a flier on me,

20:43.408 --> 20:46.244
and you could always
use an ally--

20:46.328 --> 20:47.537
Ms. De Mille!

20:50.082 --> 20:52.751
I've had my eye on you
for some time.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.587
I have observed your ambition.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.465
Your single-mindedness.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.844
And your ability to compromise.

21:02.928 --> 21:07.015
And what those concessions
have done to your character.

21:08.141 --> 21:12.312
It is my opinion
that you are simply

21:12.396 --> 21:15.607
not cut out for the Bureau.

21:21.989 --> 21:22.864
Well...

21:25.033 --> 21:27.035
[clicks tongue] That's...

21:27.119 --> 21:29.746
quite a lot to digest, so I...

21:32.124 --> 21:34.167
- shall just see myself out.
- [Niles grunts softly]

21:37.713 --> 21:38.547
[groans]

21:47.264 --> 21:48.140
[exhales deeply]

21:51.101 --> 21:51.935
[panting]

21:54.646 --> 21:56.398
- [clicks]
- [alarm blaring]

22:05.574 --> 22:08.243
I knew there was
something off about you.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.918
[Larry] Thanks for these.

22:19.588 --> 22:23.425
[voice echoing] It is from me?

22:23.508 --> 22:26.178
[Larry] Yeah, that's right.
It's our... It's our Keeg.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.307
You know,
maybe you could help us.

22:31.391 --> 22:34.269
You want my help?

22:34.352 --> 22:37.481
[Larry] I know dying shouldn't
be that big of a deal.

22:37.564 --> 22:39.608
I've made it a century, right?

22:39.691 --> 22:42.194
But the thing is,
I have Keeg now.

22:42.277 --> 22:45.781
And I've been worrying
about who's gonna take care of him after I go.

22:46.656 --> 22:47.699
I'm thinking...

22:49.117 --> 22:50.243
maybe it could be you.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.790
I... I know
he'd be safe with you.

22:54.873 --> 22:58.960
And you could maybe
teach him things about himself that I never could.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.215
- No.
- [Larry] Oh.

23:03.298 --> 23:05.884
Did you not hear the part
where I said I'm dying?

23:05.967 --> 23:07.302
This Larry...

23:08.178 --> 23:10.472
not ready for two.

23:11.848 --> 23:14.851
- I am sorry.
- [Larry] You're sorry?

23:14.935 --> 23:16.978
I'm not even
supposed to be here.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.564
I'm on a mission to save Rita,
and I'm throwing it away

23:19.648 --> 23:21.608
to ask you for help
saving our child.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.193
And you're sorry?

23:23.276 --> 23:25.779
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

23:25.862 --> 23:28.448
I wasn't mad at you
because you left.

23:28.532 --> 23:33.829
It's because you gave me
a second chance at fatherhood and it's been beautiful.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.790
But now,
it's the most painful thing I've experienced,

23:36.873 --> 23:38.667
because it's all for naught.

23:38.750 --> 23:42.087
I'm fucking dying, and I can't
take care of my child!

23:44.339 --> 23:45.340
[voice echoing] Keeg...

23:46.007 --> 23:47.884
will be well.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.553
[Larry] You don't know that.
He... He's...

23:49.636 --> 23:52.013
He's not as strong as you.
He worries...

23:52.639 --> 23:54.182
Why worry?

23:54.266 --> 23:56.852
Because there's a solid chance
that Keeg is what kills me.

23:59.688 --> 24:00.730
Kill?

24:00.814 --> 24:02.691
[Larry grunts in pain]

24:02.774 --> 24:04.734
Yeah. Good.
You two talk it out.

24:08.155 --> 24:10.240
[Jane] What is that shit?

24:10.323 --> 24:13.160
[Niles] It's a potion
concocted by a friend.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.370
It's supposed to
erase memories.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.330
You're going to forget this?

24:17.414 --> 24:22.127
Apparently, knowledge
of the future is more poisonous than this shit.

24:22.210 --> 24:25.088
Well, you might wanna
pour yourself a double,

24:25.172 --> 24:26.882
because I have
a question for you.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.800
Well, why not ask
the me of your time?

24:28.884 --> 24:30.302
Because you're not
there anymore.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.642
[exhales] I see.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.240
Why did we have
so many sessions

24:52.324 --> 24:54.201
when you knew
I was a lost cause?

24:55.410 --> 24:57.412
Why on earth
would you think that?

24:57.495 --> 25:00.665
Because I know there's a room
with a dozen locks on the door

25:00.749 --> 25:03.043
waiting for me
at Josh Clay's house.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.254
For your worst-case scenarios.

25:06.338 --> 25:11.509
So I have to assume
you don't have high hopes for me.

25:11.593 --> 25:15.222
It's just that you're sometimes
so hard to reach, Jane.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.641
Your tether is so thin.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.643
So why do you keep trying?

25:19.726 --> 25:21.102
Why are you trying now?

25:22.354 --> 25:23.647
Because I'm your friend.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.148
Do you honestly believe that?

25:25.232 --> 25:26.483
Yes, I do.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.693
I am your incredibly...

25:29.569 --> 25:30.820
imperfect...

25:31.696 --> 25:32.614
friend.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.952
What about you?

25:37.035 --> 25:38.828
Do you still think
you're a lost cause?

25:40.330 --> 25:41.248
[Jane sniffles]

25:42.374 --> 25:44.668
It sure as shit looks that way.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.712
I can't find Kay and the others

25:47.796 --> 25:50.632
without solving some
fucking jigsaw puzzle,

25:50.715 --> 25:52.717
and getting my new purpose.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.970
Well, I could
help you with that. I'm quite good at puzzles.

25:55.053 --> 25:58.390
No, it's not like that. I...
I have to say something to solve it.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.226
And I don't know what that is.

26:01.309 --> 26:04.813
Or maybe you do know
what to say but don't want to.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.150
Maybe.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.822
What is it you do want, then?

26:16.241 --> 26:17.158
Peace.

26:22.706 --> 26:24.457
Is there something
wrong with that?

26:27.252 --> 26:28.169
No.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.713
It's just that...

26:31.256 --> 26:35.635
Until now, your purpose
has always been to survive.

26:35.719 --> 26:40.640
Which means I'm afraid
that you will never find absolute peace.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.229
[foil rustling]

26:48.732 --> 26:49.691
We're out of foil.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.027
Damn!

26:52.110 --> 26:54.446
[Vic]<i> Look, you don't need</i>
<i>to reconstruct the pod.</i>

26:54.529 --> 26:57.240
To find your solution,
we need to fully understand your condition.

26:57.324 --> 27:00.660
This isn't<i> Apollo 13.</i>
I have air and power.

27:00.744 --> 27:02.203
<i>I just need a way out.</i>

27:02.287 --> 27:03.830
He's not wrong.

27:03.913 --> 27:06.124
Joy, will you let me have this?

27:06.207 --> 27:07.709
[Vic]<i> Forget the pod.</i>

27:07.792 --> 27:10.253
<i>Look, imagine I'm in a hallway</i>
<i>with a million doors.</i>

27:10.337 --> 27:12.297
I just need to
open the right one.

27:12.380 --> 27:15.592
That's what I've been saying.
The portals are all about probability.

27:17.385 --> 27:19.054
This kid sounds smart.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.597
I can't believe out of all
the doors I knocked on,

27:20.680 --> 27:21.848
you were the ones who answered.

27:21.931 --> 27:23.224
[Derick]<i> Thank Mr. Invincible.</i>

27:23.308 --> 27:24.684
He's linked
to your comm system.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.354
He is?

27:29.147 --> 27:31.441
How does this kid know
how to calculate time portals?

27:32.817 --> 27:33.651
Uh...

27:36.363 --> 27:37.822
You.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.116
<i>You taught her, Vic.</i>

27:40.200 --> 27:42.911
<i>You wanted to be a hero</i>
<i>in a new way,</i>

27:42.994 --> 27:45.038
<i>and I'm sitting here</i>
<i>looking at it.</i>

27:45.121 --> 27:46.706
I'm talking to the future.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.463
You're talking to your future.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.256
[exhales in amazement]

27:55.340 --> 27:56.216
[breathing shakily]

27:58.343 --> 28:00.136
How does this happen?
What do I do?

28:00.220 --> 28:01.429
[Derick]<i> How about</i>

28:01.513 --> 28:02.889
we focus on getting you
to the present

28:02.972 --> 28:04.974
and let the future
take care of itself.

28:07.894 --> 28:08.770
[exhales] Okay.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.064
[grunts] There you go.

28:11.147 --> 28:12.524
- [Niles gasps]
- [Cliff] I sincerely hope

28:12.607 --> 28:13.441
- that hurts like hell.
- [Kipling gasping]

28:14.359 --> 28:17.153
Let's vanish. I'm sobering up.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.991
I'm sorry for whatever
has happened to you.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.160
For whatever I may...

28:25.203 --> 28:26.704
or may not do to you.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.791
But I am not that man yet.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.043
And if I become him...

28:33.044 --> 28:33.878
then...

28:35.630 --> 28:38.967
we will cross that bridge
when we come to it.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.510
- Let's go.
- [microphone feedback]

28:40.593 --> 28:42.137
[man]<i> Dr. Niles Caulder.</i>

28:42.220 --> 28:44.848
<i>This is Ernst</i>
<i>and Wilhelm Bischoff.</i>

28:44.931 --> 28:48.184
<i>Assistant cobblers to</i>
<i>Dr. Heinrich Von Fuchs.</i>

28:48.268 --> 28:52.313
<i>If you return the artifact,</i>
<i>we will execute you quickly.</i>

28:52.397 --> 28:55.150
[Cliff] News flash.
The Nazis are here.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.694
What the fuck are you doing?

28:57.777 --> 29:01.990
I was told,
in no uncertain terms, not to get involved.

29:02.073 --> 29:05.618
Nobody is rooting
harder for you than I.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.912
[Cliff] So, you've always been
a massive cock.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.748
Look, everything's fine.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.376
They're bluffing.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.503
I destroyed their armory

29:15.587 --> 29:16.921
- after I stole the necklace.
- [man yelling]

29:17.005 --> 29:17.881
[man screaming]

29:18.631 --> 29:20.008
[Cliff] The fuck?

29:20.091 --> 29:23.553
Kipling, for the love
of Churchill's ball bag...

29:23.636 --> 29:25.722
unfreeze me!

29:25.805 --> 29:27.557
Fine, fuck it. Yortlaw!

29:27.640 --> 29:28.808
[grunting]

29:28.892 --> 29:30.810
[Cliff] Motherfucker!

29:32.770 --> 29:34.147
Ooh, axes?

29:34.230 --> 29:36.566
That's the best
you could do? [scoffs]

29:36.649 --> 29:40.612
All right, let's see
how your hatchets do against my Goliath.

29:40.695 --> 29:43.031
Oh, so now we're buddies.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.866
[electrical buzzing]

29:44.949 --> 29:46.576
All right, you're up.

29:46.659 --> 29:48.244
Take their heads off.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.705
.Yeah, here's the thing.
You created me with one weakness.

29:50.788 --> 29:51.789
Electricity.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.625
- How's that?
- I'm a brain,

29:53.708 --> 29:56.711
in liquid, surrounded by metal.

29:56.794 --> 29:59.589
Don't look at me like that.
You created my ass.

29:59.672 --> 30:02.550
Now you want me
to take on two electric axes?

30:02.634 --> 30:04.052
[Niles] Fine! May I?

30:06.137 --> 30:07.096
Thank you.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.057
Ahh!

30:11.142 --> 30:13.269
How about one electric axe?

30:13.353 --> 30:14.604
[man]<i> Bruder?</i>

30:14.687 --> 30:16.189
<i>Bruder?</i>

30:16.272 --> 30:17.273
[Cliff] Fine!

30:18.316 --> 30:19.317
[Cliff grunting]

30:21.277 --> 30:22.487
[yelling]

30:24.572 --> 30:25.573
Fucking hell!

30:26.658 --> 30:28.576
Did you see that?

30:28.660 --> 30:29.869
[Cliff groaning]

30:29.953 --> 30:32.956
Uh, damn it. I'm stuck!

30:34.624 --> 30:37.126
You didn't freeze him again,
did you?

30:37.210 --> 30:40.088
[Cliff] Yeah, like I said,
Parkinson's.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.256
It happens.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.715
- [creaking]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:42.799 --> 30:44.008
Oh, shit!

30:44.092 --> 30:45.510
Whoa!

30:45.593 --> 30:46.511
[groans in frustration]

30:48.346 --> 30:50.974
How long are you gonna
keep this game up, hmm?

30:51.057 --> 30:52.976
I know you're a shifter.

30:53.059 --> 30:56.854
Okay, I'm gonna take you out,
and you're going to talk to me.

30:56.938 --> 31:00.900
And if you try anything,
I'll have the guards take care of you.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.402
Okay?

31:03.111 --> 31:04.153
Okay.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.113
[mouse squeaking]

31:13.705 --> 31:14.622
Now...

31:15.915 --> 31:17.875
Show me who you really are.

31:18.835 --> 31:19.711
[squeaking]

31:23.423 --> 31:24.299
[smacks lips]

31:27.635 --> 31:29.470
- Cute.
- Cute?

31:29.554 --> 31:31.472
How is your mind
not fucking blown?

31:31.556 --> 31:33.808
I'm you, you fucking idiot.

31:33.891 --> 31:36.352
I know a grifter
when I see one.

31:36.436 --> 31:39.147
Or did you think
I'd be so stunned by this

31:39.230 --> 31:41.316
bizarrely dressed
version of myself

31:41.399 --> 31:44.652
that you'd get the drop on me?
I invented that play.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.029
I know.

31:46.112 --> 31:49.532
Because I invented that play.
Because I am you.

31:50.783 --> 31:53.161
- Prove it.
- How?

31:53.244 --> 31:55.955
We haven't trusted a soul
since we were 14.

31:56.581 --> 31:57.498
Remember?

31:58.583 --> 32:00.501
Our parents led the mob.

32:00.585 --> 32:04.172
Chased us out of town
because we revealed our abilities.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.969
Sorry. Had to do it.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.809
[Cliff] Yeah, yep.
Oh, that's the stuff.

32:16.893 --> 32:19.520
Almost there, fellas.
I can feel it.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.064
Just a little more
elbow grease.

32:21.147 --> 32:23.191
- Come on, push!
- I am pushing. You push.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.233
[both grunting]

32:25.485 --> 32:26.611
[both straining]

32:27.654 --> 32:28.905
[Cliff grunts]

32:28.988 --> 32:32.325
[Cliff groaning]

32:33.076 --> 32:34.577
Boom!

32:34.661 --> 32:38.206
If I'm the man that builds you,
then I'm a goddamn genius.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.833
No. You're a monster.

32:42.418 --> 32:44.796
- [yelling]
- [Cliff] Look out!

32:45.755 --> 32:46.673
- [grunts]
- [bones cracking]

32:47.965 --> 32:48.800
Niles!

32:49.884 --> 32:51.094
Forgive me, Bunberry.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.309
[groaning, choking]

33:02.438 --> 33:03.731
[neck snapping]

33:06.150 --> 33:08.194
- Chief?
- [groaning]

33:11.114 --> 33:12.407
So...

33:13.491 --> 33:15.118
You're me from the future?

33:15.201 --> 33:19.789
Yes, I came for Caulder's
Immortus artifact.

33:19.872 --> 33:20.915
Why? What does it do?

33:20.998 --> 33:22.417
For us? Not a thing.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.086
But my friends need it,
and... [inhales deeply]

33:25.169 --> 33:26.337
I need them.

33:26.421 --> 33:29.006
Well, time traveling
to the Ant Farm

33:29.090 --> 33:30.758
is quite a risk to take
for your friends.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.844
Well, they help me
be a better person.

33:32.927 --> 33:35.138
And why would we need
to be better?

33:40.810 --> 33:42.895
Because I have spent
my entire existence

33:42.979 --> 33:46.274
trying to undo
all the horrible shit that we've done.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.276
I know you want
to believe you're good.

33:48.359 --> 33:52.363
You want power
so you can change the world.

33:52.447 --> 33:55.616
But this isn't the way.
The Bureau isn't the way.

33:57.076 --> 33:58.286
[laughs]

33:58.369 --> 34:00.788
But that's just
your opinion, isn't it?

34:00.872 --> 34:03.458
Because I'm not you.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.501
Not yet.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.378
I'm sure
you believe you're good,

34:07.462 --> 34:11.132
because you have become
a master at deception.

34:11.215 --> 34:15.470
I mean, you've even managed
to con yourself as to your noble intentions.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.140
- That's not true.
- But I know it is,

34:19.223 --> 34:24.020
because I am working hard
over here and I am still no better than you.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.229
And I know now...

34:26.272 --> 34:27.190
we won't change.

34:28.816 --> 34:29.942
Not till it's too late.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.614
I'm a good person,
you fucking bitch.

34:34.697 --> 34:37.116
No, you're not.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.534
[grunts]

34:41.454 --> 34:43.039

[Vic]<i> How are we doing,</i>
<i>Detroiticons?</i>

34:44.373 --> 34:45.500
[Derick] Working hard, Vic.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.667
Don't worry.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.252
These kids are geniuses.

34:48.336 --> 34:49.962
- I got it.
- Oh, thank God!

34:50.046 --> 34:52.882
[sighs in relief]<i> I swear,</i>
<i>I was for sure we were screwed.</i>

34:53.841 --> 34:54.801
So, where's the portal?

34:54.884 --> 34:56.302
Exactly where you came from.

34:56.385 --> 34:58.179
No, that can't be right.
Grid already checked there.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.806
There's a back door.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.182
A back door?

35:01.265 --> 35:03.142
Mr. Stone can get to it.
The portal will be there.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.437
How can this kid be so certain?

35:06.521 --> 35:07.438
[Joy]<i> Because it's math.</i>

35:07.522 --> 35:09.023
I've run the calculations.

35:09.106 --> 35:11.025
[Vic]<i> So has Grid.</i>

35:11.108 --> 35:14.028
Yeah, but your version of Grid
doesn't have the data that our setup has.

35:14.111 --> 35:15.905
[Joy]<i> Listen, if you wanna</i>
<i>waste time</i>

35:15.988 --> 35:17.573
and check my work, be my guest.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.784
Whoa. Hold up. Joy.

35:19.867 --> 35:20.827
We trust you.

35:21.536 --> 35:22.954
Vic,

35:23.037 --> 35:24.372
<i>can we transmit the coordinates</i>
<i>in an update to Grid?</i>

35:25.748 --> 35:26.791
Do what you have to do.

35:28.709 --> 35:29.585
[door opens]

35:31.087 --> 35:31.963
[door closes]

35:37.718 --> 35:39.136
What did I miss?

35:39.220 --> 35:41.806
[Joy]<i> We're saving you</i>
<i>from the time stream.</i>

35:41.889 --> 35:43.140
You have your doubts, though.

35:43.850 --> 35:44.725
[scoffs softly]

35:46.310 --> 35:47.228
It'll work.

35:50.857 --> 35:51.941
I checked their work.

35:53.734 --> 35:55.987
[Grid]<i> I have received</i>
<i>new coordinates.</i>

35:56.070 --> 35:59.323
There appears to be a portal
at the very spot from which we entered the time stream.

36:04.620 --> 36:07.081
Grid, recall the knuckles.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.251
[grunting]

36:10.334 --> 36:12.587
No, I don't deserve this.
I'm good.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.672
Good? You're good?

36:16.841 --> 36:17.884
[yelps]

36:17.967 --> 36:19.010

36:27.393 --> 36:30.938
Please, why? Why, why?
Please, why?

36:31.022 --> 36:33.441
Because I fucking hate us!

[screaming]

36:37.737 --> 36:38.988

36:40.615 --> 36:41.824
[Cliff] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36:41.908 --> 36:45.411
Oh, my God! No!
Chief, talk to me.

36:45.494 --> 36:46.287
[breathes shakily]

36:46.370 --> 36:48.372
I can't feel my legs.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.249
- Hold tight, Caulder.
- [gasping]

36:50.333 --> 36:51.959
I'll get us out of here
and get you some help.

36:52.043 --> 36:55.671
[Cliff] I can't... No.
This isn't happening now.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.214
This can't be on me.

36:58.132 --> 37:00.384
Please! This isn't fair.

37:00.468 --> 37:03.012
I'm not the one
who broke your fucking back.

37:05.264 --> 37:06.349
You are...

37:08.059 --> 37:10.269
quite magnificent.

37:11.604 --> 37:12.605
[Cliff] I'm sorry.

37:16.817 --> 37:18.235
[exhales]

37:18.319 --> 37:19.862
[tense music plays]

37:31.082 --> 37:31.958
[groaning]

37:36.671 --> 37:40.341
I've seen and done
some nastiness in my life.

37:40.424 --> 37:43.636
But taking longevity
from a dying man, that...

37:44.720 --> 37:46.639
is true fuckery.

37:46.722 --> 37:49.684
I mean, like you said,
he owes you, right?

37:49.767 --> 37:52.937
So, I suppose, now you're even.

37:56.065 --> 37:58.109
You're gonna wipe
his memory of this, right?

37:58.192 --> 37:59.318
Wipe his memory?

38:00.486 --> 38:01.570
He's dying.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.701
[Cliff] Why is
everything on me?

38:06.784 --> 38:10.454
Everyone else gets to
cruise through life, completely amoral.

38:10.538 --> 38:11.831
What about me?

38:11.914 --> 38:14.750
Why do I have to be
tortured by everything?

38:16.669 --> 38:17.545
[groans softly]

38:18.963 --> 38:19.839
[soft music playing]

38:44.989 --> 38:46.073
[yelling]

38:48.826 --> 38:52.288
[Larry] Hey, you know,
I hate to be pushy, but we're on a bit of a clock.

38:53.664 --> 38:54.540
[grunts in pain]

39:00.337 --> 39:01.589
Yes, I know.

39:01.672 --> 39:04.091
He thinks he's going
to throw me into the sun.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.636
[voice echoing]
No, this is different.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.848
Not death.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.726
- New life.
- [Larry] New life?

39:14.560 --> 39:15.811
I become new life?

39:16.562 --> 39:17.897
In the sun?

39:17.980 --> 39:19.398
Wha...

39:19.482 --> 39:22.234
Are you trying to tell me
that we become a fucking sun?

39:26.822 --> 39:28.032
Wait, what does that even mean?

39:28.115 --> 39:29.825
Okay, why would
we ever do that?

39:34.038 --> 39:34.955
Hey, answer me.

39:38.167 --> 39:41.504
[voice echoing]
You are stronger than my Larry.

39:42.588 --> 39:43.714
But still...

39:44.965 --> 39:46.384
So much fear.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.971
You pass it to Keeg.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.265
[Larry] Why would you say
something so cruel?

39:54.809 --> 39:55.726
- [whooshing]
- [grunts]

39:59.522 --> 40:00.606
I can do more...

40:01.857 --> 40:03.484
than what she made me for.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.571
You know, you might
not believe this,

40:07.655 --> 40:10.366
but I have made progress.

40:10.449 --> 40:12.159
The other lunatics
in this house...

40:12.243 --> 40:15.996
I've actually become
friends with them.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.165
Maybe...

40:19.500 --> 40:24.004
the others are extensions
of your purpose.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.882
They've helped you survive.
You've helped them.

40:26.966 --> 40:30.970
Maybe if you let it out,
it might free you to do...

40:31.053 --> 40:33.264
even more than
you were designed for.

40:34.431 --> 40:36.433
More even than...

40:36.517 --> 40:39.562
whatever this new purpose
might be.

40:39.645 --> 40:43.440
How do I even know
I want a new purpose?

40:47.194 --> 40:49.363
I'm so tired of being me.

40:50.447 --> 40:51.407
Right.

40:52.867 --> 40:53.993
You want peace.

40:54.076 --> 40:55.411
I mean, fuck!

40:55.494 --> 40:56.912
If not me, then who?

40:58.914 --> 41:00.875
How about Kay?

41:00.958 --> 41:04.920
She's the one
who created all of you to do the tasks that she can't.

41:05.796 --> 41:06.922
So maybe...

41:09.133 --> 41:11.093
you solving your puzzle...

41:12.178 --> 41:13.137
could free her...

41:15.139 --> 41:17.057
to search for her peace.

41:22.104 --> 41:23.856
What about the rest of us?

41:23.939 --> 41:25.482
Yes, but Kay...

41:26.817 --> 41:28.277
Kay is the one who suffered.

41:29.820 --> 41:32.489
Kay is the one
who went through the trauma.

41:32.573 --> 41:33.699
That's not true.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.076
[Hammerhead] Come on, Jane.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.245
Say it.

41:46.128 --> 41:47.213
[breath trembles]

41:47.296 --> 41:48.422
You've always known.

41:50.090 --> 41:50.966
Just say it.

41:57.306 --> 41:58.140
[exhales]

42:00.518 --> 42:01.810
It happened to all of us.

42:07.483 --> 42:08.567
It happened to me.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.327
I was raped by my father.

42:23.707 --> 42:25.501
The moment we were created...

42:27.962 --> 42:29.630
we could feel the memory.

42:44.561 --> 42:45.437
[gasps in amazement]

43:03.122 --> 43:03.998
[chuckles]

43:06.083 --> 43:06.959
[dramatic music playing]

43:31.150 --> 43:34.111
Please. Come with us.

43:34.194 --> 43:35.112
[uplifting music playing]

43:46.874 --> 43:48.500
[rumbling]

44:04.141 --> 44:05.017
[soft music playing]

44:07.102 --> 44:08.645
It's all right.

44:08.729 --> 44:09.855
We don't need it anymore.

44:11.732 --> 44:12.733
We're all together now.

44:15.194 --> 44:16.195
Where are we going?

44:18.155 --> 44:20.074
I wanna show you
what I've been building.

44:21.742 --> 44:22.659
[electricity buzzing]

44:25.037 --> 44:25.954
[magical music playing]

45:04.368 --> 45:05.702
[Larry] Three shots.

45:05.786 --> 45:08.080
We had three shots
and we failed.

45:10.749 --> 45:12.084
We don't need the longevity.

45:13.752 --> 45:15.462
We have each other.

45:15.546 --> 45:18.757
And when we come together
as one, we can do anything.

45:20.551 --> 45:22.636
[Cliff] Jane's giving
the pep talk?

45:22.719 --> 45:24.471
That's where we are?

45:24.555 --> 45:26.432
Which persona
are you right now?

45:29.601 --> 45:30.644
I'm all of us.

45:33.522 --> 45:35.691
I am the Kaleidoscope.

45:37.860 --> 45:39.570
[Madame Rouge] Uh...

45:39.653 --> 45:43.282
What the hell does that mean,
you're the Kaleidoscope?

45:43.365 --> 45:44.491
I don't totally know.

45:46.493 --> 45:47.619
I'm working that out.

45:51.832 --> 45:53.083
[Vic] Screw it.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.501
Jane's right.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.378
Young or old,
it doesn't matter.

45:56.462 --> 45:58.046
We have to do what's right.
And that means

45:58.130 --> 46:00.632
going back there
and putting up a fight.

46:00.716 --> 46:02.426
[Larry] Fight who, exactly?

46:02.509 --> 46:04.094
The all-powerful Immortus?

46:04.178 --> 46:06.513
And the ever-growing
horde of Butts?

46:06.597 --> 46:09.224
Whoever we have to
in order to save the world.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.184
[Larry sighs]

46:12.519 --> 46:14.438
To save Rita.

46:14.521 --> 46:16.190
The hell, maybe even
save ourselves.

46:18.442 --> 46:19.610
[Cliff] Fuck it.

46:19.693 --> 46:21.195
I'm going to hell anyway.

46:21.278 --> 46:23.030
If the last thing we do
before we croak

46:23.113 --> 46:25.491
is take those motherfuckers
with us,

46:25.574 --> 46:26.909
it is what it is.

46:29.536 --> 46:31.205
Grid?

46:31.288 --> 46:33.499
Proceed to the coordinates
that you received.

46:35.250 --> 46:36.210
We're going home.
