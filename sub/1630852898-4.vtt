WEBVTT

00:24.967 --> 00:25.900
Aw, shit.

00:25.934 --> 00:27.600
There we go.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.800
What is this?

00:35.834 --> 00:36.867
What’s that?

00:40.100 --> 00:40.734
Oh boy!

00:40.767 --> 00:41.600
Whoa!

00:41.633 --> 00:42.934
- Whoa!
- What?!

00:42.967 --> 00:45.633
Holy fuck, Graham Greene?

00:47.333 --> 00:50.000
I’m Graham Greene.
I’m the head producer.

00:50.033 --> 00:51.967
Hey. How are ya?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.266
Holy shit!

00:53.300 --> 00:56.200
Is, is, this Graham Greene?

00:56.233 --> 00:57.500
For real?

00:57.533 --> 01:00.633
Alright, listen up,
you lint pickin’,

01:00.667 --> 01:02.533
butt scratchin’ sons of bitches.

01:04.200 --> 01:07.967
I am hard and because
I am hard you will not like me.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.934
He’s hard!

01:09.967 --> 01:11.400
Mmm.

01:11.433 --> 01:14.433
I’m going to congratulate
you for being the top comedians

01:14.467 --> 01:19.667
who did not laugh over those
flat dicks and their shit jokes.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.500
I can’t believe these words
are coming out of his mouth.

01:22.533 --> 01:25.500
What’s your major
malfunction, numbnuts?

01:25.533 --> 01:27.667
Do you think I’m cute?
Do you like staring at my butt?

01:27.700 --> 01:29.100
I’ll be watching you.

01:29.133 --> 01:31.033
Okay. Yes, sir.

01:31.066 --> 01:34.767
I was teetering. Oh man.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.033
It’s so funny because
it’s Graham Greene saying it.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.266
Oh, I see.
You wanna be halfway.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.834
You know what halfway is?

01:42.867 --> 01:46.333
Halfway’s a bum that
doesn’t finish anything.

01:46.367 --> 01:49.500
A plastic bag half
full of dog shit.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.567
Graham Greene, he just starts

01:54.600 --> 01:55.967
calling us all bags of shit.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.367
Trevor, you’re fucked buddy.

02:01.934 --> 02:03.433
I know funny.

02:03.467 --> 02:05.600
You think sitting across
from Costner

02:05.633 --> 02:10.767
watching him tryin’ to act,
not breaking up is easy?

02:10.800 --> 02:12.266
- Damn.
- Whoa!

02:12.300 --> 02:13.967
Bull butter!

02:14.967 --> 02:16.433
This is so surreal.

02:16.467 --> 02:17.600
This is a spin off called

02:17.633 --> 02:20.333
"Discomfort with Canada’s
Top Actors."

02:20.367 --> 02:22.967
"Coming up next Colm Feore
and Anal Leakage."

02:23.000 --> 02:24.667
Well, you see my ass is leaking,

02:24.700 --> 02:26.800
just a little bit over here
and a little bit over there.

02:28.133 --> 02:30.400
I love Graham Greene.
That was disturbing.

02:30.433 --> 02:31.667
And mystifying.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.266
You’re not here to sit
around like

02:33.300 --> 02:35.500
a bunch of drunk hyenas
and laugh.

02:35.533 --> 02:37.467
Graham Greene was angry with us.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.767
I mean... that’s kinda neat.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.967
This would get me.
This would get me.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.867
Let’s crank things
up a notch shall we?

02:46.900 --> 02:48.033
Oh.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.400
What in the name of Aunt Tilly’s
nightgown do you want?

02:52.433 --> 02:53.734
What the heck’s going on?

02:53.767 --> 02:55.000
Hi everybody,
how’s it going?

02:55.033 --> 02:56.367
- Uh oh.
- Good.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.834
Thank you very much, Graham.
Graham Greene, everybody.

02:58.867 --> 02:59.867
Thank you.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.433
Yes. Graham Greene.
Legend. Legend.

03:02.467 --> 03:03.900
That was rad.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.800
The show would not have
been complete

03:05.834 --> 03:08.033
without Graham Greene
berating you.

03:08.066 --> 03:12.400
That marks the halfway point
and there’s only two people left

03:12.433 --> 03:13.867
who are absolutely cardless.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.200
Brandon.

03:16.233 --> 03:18.000
And Tom.

03:18.033 --> 03:19.467
Uh-huh.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.800
Not a single card has been
given to either of them.

03:22.834 --> 03:26.400
It would behoove those
of you who have been carded

03:26.433 --> 03:28.767
to try and fuck with them.

03:30.233 --> 03:31.000
Ohh.

03:31.033 --> 03:32.367
Great.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.800
Yeah, that’s what,
that’s why I’m here.

03:33.834 --> 03:34.834
Uh huh. Uh oh.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.600
Throw me under the bus,
Jay Baruchel.

03:36.633 --> 03:40.200
So guys. Game on.
I’ll see you guys in a bit.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.066
Thanks for having me, everybody.

03:44.133 --> 03:46.767
Bye!

03:48.300 --> 03:49.233
Excuse me.

03:49.266 --> 03:50.533
So here’s the deal:

03:50.567 --> 03:54.600
Colin, Jon, Andrew and K. Trevor
all have yellow cards

03:54.633 --> 03:58.100
while Tom and Brandon still
have spotless resumes.

03:58.133 --> 04:01.166
And I’m stuck in the lodge with
everyone else who shit the bed.

04:02.967 --> 04:05.433
Oh, Lord.
Oh Lord, Tom.

04:05.467 --> 04:07.333
I think Brandon’s gonna win.

04:07.367 --> 04:09.200
I don’t think
he’s found any of this funny.

04:09.233 --> 04:10.133
Nothing.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.400
It’s going to be a tough time.

04:11.433 --> 04:12.800
It’s gonna be a tough time.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.800
I gotta, like,
battle these people.

04:14.834 --> 04:17.300
The vultures are coming.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.400
Like how do you
fuck with Tom Green?

04:19.433 --> 04:21.166
You’re dead on
the inside, right?

04:23.033 --> 04:24.400
I don’t know. Hmm.

04:24.433 --> 04:25.500
I don’t know.

04:25.533 --> 04:26.800
I don’t know.
What do you find funny?

04:26.834 --> 04:29.433
I have been on a sort of
razor blade’s edge. Uh...

04:29.467 --> 04:31.633
- Yeah. Yeah.
- This entire time.

04:31.667 --> 04:34.166
It’s a good poker face though.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.800
I’m gonna keep
a straight face.

04:35.834 --> 04:40.133
I’m gonna have no fun ’cause
that’s the kinda guy I am.

04:40.166 --> 04:45.166
A humourless, straight-faced,

04:45.200 --> 04:47.533
unfun individual.

04:47.567 --> 04:48.533
Yeah.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.066
I’m gonna go get some water.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.000
I’m gonna
go get some water.

04:51.033 --> 04:52.367
Anyone want a glass of water?

04:52.400 --> 04:54.734
Eh, that’s a good strategy.
Interesting strategy.

04:54.767 --> 04:58.166
Yeah.
Yeah.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.734
Since there’s been
a lot of music.

04:59.767 --> 05:03.166
I feel that this is my chance
to do a little dance

05:03.200 --> 05:04.333
for you, my new friends.

05:04.367 --> 05:06.233
- Mmmm.
- Oh, thank you.

05:06.266 --> 05:08.000
Very excited to see it.

05:08.033 --> 05:09.367
Colin wants the band!

05:09.400 --> 05:10.667
Because I think he’s
stepping up to the challenge

05:10.700 --> 05:12.533
of taking down
Tom and Brandon.

05:14.133 --> 05:15.300
All right, guys.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.900
Wooo.

05:17.934 --> 05:20.934
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh oh...
Wipeout ♪

05:35.900 --> 05:38.533
Trevor!
What is that face?

05:39.567 --> 05:40.767
Trevor and Jon!

05:49.533 --> 05:51.600
He’s gonna hurt himself.

05:51.633 --> 05:52.900
Oh! Jon!

05:52.934 --> 05:53.700
Jon is so close.

05:57.467 --> 05:59.300
He’s good.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.133
He’s, errr, very good.
One of the best.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.367
Wipeout!

06:25.400 --> 06:27.367
How do you not laugh at that?

06:27.400 --> 06:29.066
Are you not a human being?

06:29.100 --> 06:30.900
Are you not alive?

06:30.934 --> 06:32.433
One more time.

06:35.233 --> 06:36.066
Oh God! Did he just say
"One more time?"

06:36.100 --> 06:37.133
Yes!

06:37.166 --> 06:38.133
I’m dying.

06:45.066 --> 06:47.166
I saw Tom’s eyes light up

06:47.200 --> 06:50.900
a little bit at the
humping of the table.

06:50.934 --> 06:52.100
The humping the table.

06:52.133 --> 06:53.834
That was tough for me.

06:53.867 --> 06:56.033
Colin, of course, having
done so much improvisation

06:56.066 --> 06:59.133
and having the ability
to get very silly like that,

06:59.166 --> 07:02.500
I’m in danger territory.

07:02.533 --> 07:04.467
Why did Colin wait
’til now to be funny?

07:05.767 --> 07:08.767
I could have been out
an hour ago!

07:08.800 --> 07:12.467
One of the things I’ve based
my career on has been stamina.

07:14.033 --> 07:16.433
Just hanging in there ’til
everyone else quits or dies.

07:19.767 --> 07:21.266
I was like wanna battle?

07:21.300 --> 07:23.800
Wanna, wanna roll?
Let’s roll, Colin!

07:32.967 --> 07:35.367
Look at Jon.

07:36.433 --> 07:37.333
Jon.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.700
Jon!

07:43.333 --> 07:46.066
Oh my goodness.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.633
He’s throwing peanuts
into his mouth

07:47.667 --> 07:49.433
Oh my God...

07:54.667 --> 07:56.233
Mmmm hmmm.

07:56.266 --> 07:58.667
Woooo!

07:58.700 --> 08:00.433
Oh Lord, it
took everything in me

08:00.467 --> 08:01.800
not to laugh at that.

08:04.633 --> 08:06.667
Sixty four!

08:08.166 --> 08:09.200
Colin, this one's for you!

08:09.233 --> 08:11.800
Wooo. Whoa!

08:11.834 --> 08:14.333
He caught that!

08:14.367 --> 08:15.734
I’m gonna be over
here for a while.

08:15.767 --> 08:18.300
That was endurance
my friend.

08:18.333 --> 08:19.934
Woo!

08:19.967 --> 08:25.033
I was on a razor
blade edge there.

08:26.166 --> 08:29.567
Oh my God.
You’re all champions.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.333
I thought Jon was going
to actually vomit.

08:31.367 --> 08:32.066
Me, too.

08:32.100 --> 08:33.066
Oooh.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.133
Oh my penis has
never been so hard.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.633
Mine, too.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.166
Brandon’s an enigma.

08:40.300 --> 08:43.266
I dunno what is gonna
break that guy.

08:43.300 --> 08:46.300
I want them all
to team up on Brandon.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.567
What the hell is wrong with you?

08:47.600 --> 08:51.133
I suffered a heart attack
and a partial stroke,

08:51.166 --> 08:54.033
dancing just to
make you laugh.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.166
I tend to be, you know,
fairly clean

08:56.200 --> 08:58.700
but I thought okay
I’m gonna have to go for it.

08:58.734 --> 09:01.667
I was giving
my fucking all, Brandon.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.266
Oh shit!

09:03.300 --> 09:05.333
This could be
trouble for Brandon.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.967
I thought I gotta get Brandon,
I gotta get Brandon.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.433
Canadian legend right here.

09:09.467 --> 09:10.533
I can see. I know.

09:10.567 --> 09:11.900
Canadian legend!

09:11.934 --> 09:12.900
I’m so uncomfortable.

09:12.934 --> 09:14.734
It’s all ok.

09:14.767 --> 09:17.200
You’ve been a bad boy!

09:17.233 --> 09:18.867
Unbreakable Ash-Mohammed,
that is me.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.166
That is I.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.233
What does it take? Does it take
jokes about Facebook?

09:23.266 --> 09:28.834
Instagram?
About tweeting of the stuff?

09:28.867 --> 09:33.100
Internet? MySpace?
Modem?

09:33.133 --> 09:35.300
Dial up, motherfucker!

09:35.333 --> 09:36.667
I don’t think I had dial up.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.333
When I started making
internet videos

09:38.367 --> 09:41.767
you had to shoot ’em
on a camera!

09:41.800 --> 09:43.533
A camera!

09:44.834 --> 09:46.367
Brandon is almost
smiling, look!

09:47.800 --> 09:50.233
When I started doing comedy,
we had meat rations.

09:50.266 --> 09:54.500
We could not eat meat.
So we had to be funny on butter.

09:57.834 --> 10:00.900
Butter shaped like lamb.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.266
Butter shaped
like lamb?

10:02.300 --> 10:04.133
Look it up in your Google.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.500
Well...

10:05.533 --> 10:06.867
Make an old man happy.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.100
One little laugh.
One little smile.

10:10.934 --> 10:13.367
Oh c’mon, nothing for that?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.533
I might be able to win this.
I might be able to win this now.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.166
Uh oh.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.800
I feel something’s
happening.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.934
- Uh-oh.
- This is worrisome.

10:27.867 --> 10:30.200
Um, alright, well,
while we’re waiting, uh,

10:30.233 --> 10:31.533
pfft, I don’t know this is,

10:31.567 --> 10:33.734
eh, Patrick Stewart
having an orgasm.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.500
"I’m about to cum!"

10:35.533 --> 10:36.734
Oh.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.200
I’m just a little guy.
There we go.

10:45.233 --> 10:49.133
Where are you going for,
uh, Canada Day this year?

10:49.166 --> 10:50.467
Lake Titicaca?

10:52.300 --> 10:53.900
He’s funny!

10:53.934 --> 10:55.834
They’re just reacting
very strangely.

10:55.867 --> 10:56.867
Seriously.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.667
It got a little weird.

10:58.700 --> 11:03.600
It’s starting to feel
like "Waiting for Godot"...

11:03.633 --> 11:06.333
I’m just a little baby.
Look at me.

11:06.367 --> 11:08.967
And a couple tablespoons
of "Fight Club".

11:10.834 --> 11:12.033
Oh.

11:15.367 --> 11:18.000
I’m very familiar with anatomy
so I know where to put these.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.934
That’s how Kim Kardashian
was born.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.934
I can say with certainty,

11:29.967 --> 11:33.967
that has never aired on
Canadian television before.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.200
There was a Wayne and Shuster
After Dark.

11:38.900 --> 11:42.467
Wayne and Shuster’s ass-tits
bit was very famous.

11:45.467 --> 11:48.400
See, there’s no one old enough
to laugh at that in there!

11:51.633 --> 11:54.967
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.500
How are the walleye biting
down at Lake Titicaca?

11:59.633 --> 12:01.333
This is really where
I thought my career

12:01.367 --> 12:03.200
was going to end up,
locked in a studio

12:03.233 --> 12:05.600
talking to Tom Green
with tit eyes.

12:05.633 --> 12:09.800
♪ Comedy, comedy
This is comedy ♪

12:09.834 --> 12:12.033
Alright, time
to raise the curtain.

12:14.867 --> 12:15.767
Ooh.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.300
Whoa oh.
Uh oh. Uh oh.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.834
- Oh!
- Oh boy.

12:20.867 --> 12:21.834
Oh, little seats.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.667
Those are small chairs.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.900
♪ What’s gonna happen? ♪

12:25.934 --> 12:27.934
It seems like a major set up.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.767
This is gonna be big.

12:35.433 --> 12:37.200
I guess that’s it.

12:37.233 --> 12:38.533
I’m not going to lie,

12:38.567 --> 12:40.066
I thought something more
was going to happen.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.367
We have a smaller set now

12:42.400 --> 12:45.600
which amused me, because why?

12:45.633 --> 12:47.900
Right now one of the writers
is being told

12:47.934 --> 12:50.400
how much it cost
to build the mini set.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.367
Yes, that was,
so that was worth five grand.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.467
That was worth it right?

12:54.500 --> 12:55.333
That was five grand
for the mini set?

12:55.367 --> 12:56.100
This bit’s got legs right?

12:56.133 --> 12:57.834
Yeah.

12:57.867 --> 12:59.300
Show of hands,
who voted for the mini set?

12:59.333 --> 13:01.066
Are we like rats right now?

13:01.100 --> 13:03.233
We’re supposed to go,
come over and...

13:03.266 --> 13:04.400
Check it out?

13:04.433 --> 13:06.266
Is it possible
that nothing’s changed

13:06.300 --> 13:08.700
and we’re just all
losing our minds?

13:08.734 --> 13:11.333
I think there’s a
60 percent chance

13:11.367 --> 13:12.266
that that’s what’s happening.

13:13.233 --> 13:15.033
Uh oh. The train’s running.

13:15.066 --> 13:16.433
Three hours!

13:16.467 --> 13:18.300
Three hours, we’re here.

13:21.133 --> 13:26.166
I think I’m going to be the
first one to shit here today.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.200
Mmm. In the bathroom?

13:27.233 --> 13:28.500
Yeah.

13:28.533 --> 13:29.900
There’s no chance that
I’d be able to do that.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.700
- No.
- It’s not that I want to.

13:31.734 --> 13:34.367
Yeah, it’d be weird
if you wanted to.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.266
Oh no, not this again.

13:36.300 --> 13:39.233
I’ve gotta fucking
put an end to this.

13:41.734 --> 13:43.166
Hi, I listen to CHUM.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.767
Hi, hi, Trevor.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.133
You’re gonna host a talk show
called "Let’s Roll That Clip".

13:47.166 --> 13:50.367
You will interview people,
at any point in the interview

13:50.400 --> 13:52.266
you will interrupt
your guest and say

13:52.300 --> 13:55.166
"Let’s roll that clip" and then
they will show some videos.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.166
Can do.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.166
Alright buddy.
See ya in a bit.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.333
Thanks so much.

13:58.367 --> 14:01.066
All right, guys, I am
hosting a talk show now.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.266
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.166
A talk show game called
"Let’s Roll That Clip".

14:05.200 --> 14:08.400
My first guest is
the legendary Tom Green.

14:08.433 --> 14:11.066
Tom Green.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.533
- Yeah, Tom Green.
- Tom Green!

14:13.567 --> 14:15.934
That actually would be
a fucking good talk show.

14:15.967 --> 14:19.467
Tom, I hear you do, uh,
uh, movies and TV sometimes.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.133
- Uh... I try.
- What’s that like?

14:21.166 --> 14:22.233
It’s a lot of fun.
A lot of fun.

14:22.266 --> 14:24.200
Yeah. I get to
do things like this.

14:24.233 --> 14:26.266
Like come on your show
which is, uh...

14:26.300 --> 14:27.700
Terrific!
Let’s roll that clip!

14:27.734 --> 14:28.400
Okay, let’s have a look.

14:29.633 --> 14:31.433
Is that a movie
or a TV show?

14:31.467 --> 14:33.166
No, that’s just some
home video actually.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.533
Ooh.

14:34.567 --> 14:37.467
Yeah that’s uh, that was
before, uh, I started shaving.

14:42.734 --> 14:44.433
Yeah. Oh my gosh. Okay.

14:44.467 --> 14:47.400
I can’t believe you got this
video of me and my sister.

14:50.967 --> 14:52.967
Okay. I’m done!

14:53.000 --> 14:55.200
- Mmm.
- Uh oh!

14:55.233 --> 14:56.800
Shit! Oh my god!

14:58.233 --> 14:59.266
I’m out.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.767
Whoa. There it is.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.867
The good news is, I’m not
gonna have to shit in here.

15:05.900 --> 15:09.300
That is good news.
That is great news.

15:11.667 --> 15:12.800
The good die young.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.600
I, I wonder who
you’re here for?

15:18.633 --> 15:20.266
Yeah...

15:20.300 --> 15:23.500
Yeah... let’s, let’s
roll that clip!

15:23.533 --> 15:25.600
That was before, uh,
I started shaving.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.767
Yeah. Oh my gosh. Okay.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.000
I can’t believe you got
this video of me and my sister.

15:32.133 --> 15:33.467
Okay. I’m done!

15:41.166 --> 15:42.734
Ladies and gentlemen...

15:42.767 --> 15:45.100
K. Trevor Wilson...
...red card! Eliminated.

15:45.133 --> 15:46.300
Woo!

15:46.333 --> 15:47.633
You all are amazing.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.800
It has been lovely to work
and meet with all of you.

15:49.834 --> 15:51.667
- Alright, see you Trevor.
- Woo.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.600
I think I might
have knocked out

15:52.633 --> 15:53.834
more people than anybody.

15:53.867 --> 15:56.934
Who’s counting?
But I just, you know...three.

15:56.967 --> 15:58.133
Thank you very much.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.500
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

16:03.867 --> 16:05.767
So let’s unpack this.
How do you feel?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.700
Yeah, well you know
I lasted longer

16:07.734 --> 16:08.533
than I thought I would actually.

16:08.567 --> 16:09.633
Yeah?

16:09.667 --> 16:11.300
And I wasn’t kidding,
I really was

16:11.333 --> 16:12.333
about to go take a shit, so...

16:13.467 --> 16:14.633
I think it was better
for everyone

16:14.667 --> 16:16.266
that I went out when I did.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.467
I don’t shit politely.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.367
I, I, know who I am.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.166
What? Now we’re locked
in here with no bathroom?!

16:24.967 --> 16:27.433
No longer mellow yellow,
K. Trevor gets flushed

16:27.467 --> 16:28.767
by Tom Green.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.867
That’s three
people Tom’s eliminated.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.367
We’re now down to five.

16:34.567 --> 16:35.834
Here we go again.

16:42.233 --> 16:44.867
We got a little, uh,
mid episode replacement.

16:44.900 --> 16:48.066
K. Trevor Wilson’s bid adieu.

16:48.100 --> 16:52.266
Uh, please welcome to
the stage Colin Mochrie’s...

16:52.300 --> 16:53.667
puppet.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.166
- C’mon everybody!
- Wooo.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.333
We’re bringing him
up to the stage.

16:56.367 --> 16:58.200
Alright!
There he is.

17:00.133 --> 17:02.934
My marionette.
A fan made it for me.

17:02.967 --> 17:04.400
Although I think it kinda
looks more like

17:04.433 --> 17:07.100
Colm Feore than me
but whatever.

17:07.133 --> 17:08.767
So nice to, uh, be here Andrew.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.066
Very, very happy to be here.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.266
It’s so great having you,
you know, you, uh,

17:12.300 --> 17:14.333
your career has spanned
many, many years

17:14.367 --> 17:16.600
and you are here with,
uh, with a new project.

17:16.633 --> 17:18.934
- Yes.
- Say no more. Roll that clip.

17:18.967 --> 17:20.000
Alright.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.767
It’s a man, uh, with a condom.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.266
Mmm.

17:26.300 --> 17:30.133
...who goes back in time to stop
the birth of Tom Green’s sister.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.200
Tom doesn’t wanna laugh.

17:34.233 --> 17:37.066
And I guess what gave you
the inspiration for that idea?

17:37.100 --> 17:38.266
Uh, Tom Green.

17:41.667 --> 17:44.500
He actually had, um,
invested in a grant to study,

17:44.533 --> 17:45.967
- uh, time travel...
- Oh damn.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.133
...so in fact he could
go back

17:47.166 --> 17:49.767
and stop the birth
of his sister,

17:49.800 --> 17:53.433
so he could get the inheritance

17:53.467 --> 17:57.533
to make his
delicious cheese sandwiches.

17:57.567 --> 18:01.900
- Delicious cheese sandwiches.
- Oh!

18:01.934 --> 18:08.233
- Delicious cheese sandwiches.
- Delicious cheese sandwiches.

18:09.800 --> 18:16.867
♪ Delicious cheese sandwiches
Delicious cheese sandwiches ♪

a piano player but...

18:24.333 --> 18:25.967
I do like to
tinkle on the ivories.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.967

18:45.333 --> 18:46.767
- Hello?
- Hello?

18:46.800 --> 18:48.600
What’s up?
You wanted something?

18:48.633 --> 18:52.467
Yeah, um, okay, yeah sure.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.934
- No. Don’t do this to me.
- Yeah, yeah yeah.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.433
Don’t do this to me again.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.900
- No, that’s not a problem.
- Don’t do this to me again.

18:57.934 --> 19:00.433
Yeah, it’s a little
hard for this show

19:00.467 --> 19:02.567
but, uh, we need
new jokes in here.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.800
You piece of shit.

19:03.834 --> 19:04.800
Yeah, you too, buddy.

19:04.834 --> 19:07.333
- You piece of shit.
- You too. Yeah.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.100
I’ll see you, too.
Alright. Bye bye.

19:11.133 --> 19:13.567
Um, so eh,
Tom just for one second, uh,

19:13.600 --> 19:17.200
Jay, he’s like ok it’s getting
a little slow in here.

19:17.233 --> 19:18.567
He wants to tell one joke.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.367
Fucking hell.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
God Dammit man.

19:22.433 --> 19:25.300
So, uh, Jay... it’s not my joke,

19:25.333 --> 19:27.367
Uh, he says, eh,

19:27.400 --> 19:31.000
"Hey cancel culture’s
getting outta hand, huh?"

19:33.166 --> 19:35.300
Yeah, I mean,
look, I get it.

19:35.333 --> 19:38.200
Some people deserve
to be cancelled

19:38.233 --> 19:40.900
but I mean, Harvey Weinstein?

19:48.033 --> 19:49.233
Yeah, they’re not laughing?

19:49.266 --> 19:51.333
Yeah.
Well, we’re not supposed to.

19:51.367 --> 19:52.600
Yeah. Okay.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.600
Yeah, I’ll try one later,
another one later.

19:54.633 --> 19:56.100
Yeah, you just call me
if you have more jokes.

19:56.133 --> 19:58.066
Okay, bye bye.

19:58.100 --> 19:59.567
Dammit!

20:01.467 --> 20:03.967
Uh oh. Who is it?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.233
- Uh oh!

20:06.266 --> 20:08.033
- Who’s that?
- Pizza?

20:08.066 --> 20:08.934
- Uh oh.
- Oh my gosh.

20:08.967 --> 20:10.900
Oh.

Oh well look who it is.

You asshole.

20:15.233 --> 20:18.333
You asshole.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.934
The man who just walked in
is one of my best friends,

20:20.967 --> 20:22.467
Paul Sun-Hyung Lee.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.467
My co-star in Kim’s Convenience.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.000
He’s coming after me!

20:27.033 --> 20:28.700
That’s like a
really weird hallway.

20:28.734 --> 20:29.767
Yeah. It is.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.300
It’s like right
outta Resident Evil.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.066
Uh, I’m sorry I’m late.
I have the pizzas.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.867
Oh, I’ll, I’ll take them.

20:37.900 --> 20:38.934
Ohhhhhh....

20:38.967 --> 20:40.266
Oh boy.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.700
Don’t worry.

20:41.734 --> 20:43.100
But, uh, it’s still good!
It’s, it’s, still good.

20:43.133 --> 20:44.500
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah?

20:44.533 --> 20:45.433
The whole, like this,
is just...

20:45.467 --> 20:46.567
- Wow. Wow.
- Ooh.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.500
There you go. Perfect.

20:47.533 --> 20:48.967
Here. Let me give you a hand.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.200
Yes. Thank you.

20:54.367 --> 20:58.300
It’s all good,
it’s all good, it’s cool.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.834
You though! I know you!

21:05.367 --> 21:08.300
Is this it?

21:08.333 --> 21:10.834
I loved you in
Kim’s Cornerstore.

21:10.867 --> 21:12.667
Thank you. I played the dad.
On the show.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.900
- The dad?
- The dad. I played the...

21:13.934 --> 21:14.967
- He’s a hack.
- I played the father.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.100
- The father?
- Yeah.

21:16.133 --> 21:17.467
What a fucking faker
that guy was. Ho ho.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.500
No, no, no I played the dad.

21:18.533 --> 21:19.767
He was the biggest
piece of shit.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.500
That accent that
he fucking used?

21:21.533 --> 21:23.867
Holy shit!
I couldn’t believe that.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.567
Jon walked off camera.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.266
Oh, Jon, Jon’s
been slowly losing it.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.834
Jon’s teetering on the edge.

21:29.867 --> 21:30.767
- You, sir!
- Mmmm hmmm.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.934
Could use a slice of pizza.

21:31.967 --> 21:33.100
Mmmm hmmm.

21:33.133 --> 21:34.500
C’mon, Jon,
have a slice of pizza.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.166
Get in there.
Get in there, brother.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.834
- There you go.
- Ooh ok.

21:37.867 --> 21:40.700
- From the hand...
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:40.734 --> 21:43.300
That is so nice.
There you go.

21:43.333 --> 21:45.033
- Mmmm.
- Oh. Very good. Yeah!

21:45.066 --> 21:46.633
Mmmm.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.533
A little Delta variant
for ya there.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.066
I gotta go,
thank you gentlemen so much.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.233
- Very good.
- Great seeing you.

21:55.266 --> 21:56.700
Again, I’m sorry for the pizzas.

21:56.734 --> 22:00.400
Um, there is the matter
of, uh, a tip?

22:00.433 --> 22:02.467
A tip. Hmmm.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.333
I’ll give you this titty?

22:06.967 --> 22:08.266
There’s some of
this slice left?

22:08.300 --> 22:10.166
Yeah. Yeah.
I wouldn’t eat that though.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.433
Alright, thanks so much.

22:11.467 --> 22:12.834
We didn’t catch your
name by the way,

22:12.867 --> 22:13.667
what’s, eh, what’s your name?

22:13.700 --> 22:14.834
What’s your name, yeah?

22:14.867 --> 22:16.000
Andrew Phung.

22:16.033 --> 22:17.233
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:17.266 --> 22:20.133
Andrew.
Nice meeting you.

22:20.166 --> 22:21.433
- That was awesome.
- Bye Andrew.

22:21.467 --> 22:24.000
Ooh. Ooh.

22:24.033 --> 22:26.300
Yeah. That almost rocked me.
That almost rocked me.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.600
Ooh.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.300
At this point
Brandon has not laughed.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.200
I didn’t know where to go.

22:37.233 --> 22:40.133
I’d gone from all my
classic bits

22:40.166 --> 22:42.567
to like just
shouting at Brandon,

22:42.600 --> 22:43.600
this far from his face!

22:43.633 --> 22:45.734
And still nothing.

22:45.767 --> 22:46.967
Hi Brandon. Brandon.
Come over here.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.266
Okay.

22:48.300 --> 22:51.166
I’m going to do the speech
from the movie "Taken".

22:51.200 --> 22:52.000
Oooh. Oooh.

22:52.033 --> 22:54.000
Starring, uh, Liam Neeson.

22:54.033 --> 22:55.033
- Oh yeah.
- Let me take a seat.

22:55.066 --> 22:56.734
But I’m gonna do
it as Elmer Fudd.

22:56.767 --> 22:58.500
- Okay.
- Mmmm.

23:00.667 --> 23:02.467
I’m just trying
to find anything,

23:02.500 --> 23:04.500
that’s going to do anything,
any kind of a reaction.

23:05.834 --> 23:07.266
Imagine he’s on the phone.

23:07.300 --> 23:10.200
I don’t know who you are.

23:10.233 --> 23:12.367
I don’t know what you want.

23:12.400 --> 23:16.400
If you want ransom,
I don’t have any money.

23:16.433 --> 23:19.333
What I do have is

23:19.367 --> 23:24.500
a very particular
set of skills.

23:24.533 --> 23:29.567
Skills that will be a
nightmare for someone like you.

23:32.266 --> 23:33.333
Oh, wow.

23:33.367 --> 23:34.900
Oh, that’s right,
you’re here!

23:37.300 --> 23:42.734
If you let my daughter go now,
I will not follow you.

23:43.800 --> 23:44.567
Oh my God.

23:44.600 --> 23:48.166
But if you do not...

23:48.200 --> 23:51.433
I will look for you.

23:51.467 --> 23:55.333
I will find you

23:55.367 --> 23:58.967
and I will kill you.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.200
Oh my God!

24:07.467 --> 24:09.367
Tom is very Jack Nicholson

24:09.400 --> 24:10.900
in the final third
of The Shining right now.

24:10.934 --> 24:11.900
Yes!

24:11.934 --> 24:12.900
He’s starting to, he’s turning.

24:16.433 --> 24:17.867
Are you alright?

24:17.900 --> 24:19.367
I got a little
too into it there.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.033
That’s alright
would you like a...

24:22.066 --> 24:26.233
Delicious cheese sandwich?

24:26.266 --> 24:27.633
- Sandwiches...
- Don’t you. Don’t. Don’t.

24:27.667 --> 24:30.433
- A delicious Kraft cheese?
- No. No!

24:30.467 --> 24:32.567
- Maybe cheddar?
- Colin Mochrie.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.900
- Maybe some nice old cheese?
- Don’t you with your cheese.

24:34.934 --> 24:35.967
Between two pieces of bread.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.533
Don’t you with your
cheese sandwich.

24:40.967 --> 24:42.467
Delicious... Cheese...

24:42.500 --> 24:45.600
Don’t you dare with
your cheese sandwich!

24:45.633 --> 24:47.567
Delicious cheese!

24:47.600 --> 24:49.600
How dare you, Colin Mochrie,

24:49.633 --> 24:53.033
with your cheese
sandwich kryptonite.

24:54.934 --> 24:56.266
You know the chink in my armour.

24:56.300 --> 24:58.200
My Achilles’ heel.

24:58.233 --> 25:00.266
Delicious cheese.
Delicious cheese.

25:00.300 --> 25:01.500
The delicious cheese sandwich!

25:01.533 --> 25:02.567
...sandwiches.
Sandwiches. Delicious.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.934
Delicious cheese sandwich!

25:03.967 --> 25:05.934
Jon’s holding on for dear life.

25:05.967 --> 25:07.166
He’s got a yellow card,
doesn’t he?

25:07.200 --> 25:08.934
Yeah, he does have a yellow.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.567
This is insanity.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.633
And you have to not laugh?

25:12.667 --> 25:15.033
Impossible. So I’m screwed.

25:15.066 --> 25:16.867
It’s the delicious
cheese sandwich!
