00:36.036 --> 00:37.136
Feeling sick?

00:39.706 --> 00:41.224
Ain't no room for remorse.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.027
The Prophets are shit.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.781
They want to exterminate
us 'cause they fear us.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.492
And they should.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.161
We're the future, Lil' Spooky.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.246
This is our hood.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.876
I know you question what you did.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.630
But what you did what had to be done.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.759
You handled your shit.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.512
You ensured your future.

01:20.872 --> 01:21.973
I'm proud of you.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.062
We're proud of you.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.779
You're a Santo.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.787
Imaging, extension 181.

01:44.313 --> 01:47.064
Imaging, please pick up, extension 181.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.024
Yummy?

01:48.025 --> 01:48.941
Mm-hmm.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.527
Look who's here.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.737
Uncle Chivo!

01:52.738 --> 01:54.822
He's been eating, walking, talking.

01:54.823 --> 01:58.075
Talking? Oh, I bet he
has a lot to share.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.138
- Oh, let me help you. I can do that.
- You sure?

02:02.414 --> 02:04.307
What a special nephew you have.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.604
No, no, no, no, no.

02:11.632 --> 02:15.068
Why'd you do it, asswipe?
Why did you lie to me about RollerWorld?

02:16.011 --> 02:17.279
I'm hungry.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.366
What was the point?

02:21.933 --> 02:23.952
Was Julio's death worth it?

02:24.478 --> 02:28.022
- Julio wasn't a good homie...
- And I found Juanita, you sick bastard.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.207
Juanita loves me.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.377
- She doesn't love Julio.
- So you held her hostage?

02:32.944 --> 02:35.213
- To keep her safe.
- With this?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.281
The map.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.783
"The map?"

02:38.784 --> 02:40.594
This is not a map.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.053
This is nothing!

02:42.746 --> 02:47.476
I wasted my time looking for nothing
when I could've saved my friend.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.062
And now I have blood on my hands.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.482
And so do you.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.110
Was there ever any money?

02:58.595 --> 02:59.695
I don't know.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.615
That's all Ricky left me.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.409
That and some bad rhymes.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.245
So you created a fake scavenger hunt?

03:09.856 --> 03:11.249
I lost my friends.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.589
I lost my credibility.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.467
And I lost my belief.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.137
I believed.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.600
I really believed.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.813
Don't you have anything to say?

03:34.423 --> 03:35.899
But wasn't it fun?

03:45.350 --> 03:46.785
Fun?

04:33.982 --> 04:36.459
God damn it!

04:39.154 --> 04:40.254
Bless you.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.991
Can you believe we were
here only a few hours ago?

04:43.992 --> 04:45.176
When there was hope.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.638
Oh, my God!

04:50.248 --> 04:51.850
I mean, goodness.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.604
- Seriously?
- What?

04:56.004 --> 04:57.546
There's a typo in the program.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.382
"Their" is spelled with an
e-r-e instead of e-i-r.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.884
Only e-i-r shows possession.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.345
Really? You think this is
a time to grammar troll?

05:04.346 --> 05:07.223
Jamal was supposed to double-check
before they were printed.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.183
Add it to the list. He's a loser.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.602
Hey! I know you're mad,

05:11.603 --> 05:15.105
but try to temper your 'tude today.
And be cool when Jamal gets here.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.817
- He's not coming. We're better for it.
- What about Olivia?

05:17.818 --> 05:20.420
- Cesar's probably won't show either.
- We don't know that.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.424
- He just killed someone.
- We don't know that for sure.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.677
Monse... we know.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.830
Getting some air will do you good.

05:30.831 --> 05:34.083
Yeah. Hopefully, it'll help the
mocos go down easier, too.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.085
But I'm telling you, this ain't nothing.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.439
I'm gonna be back to my
fine-ass self in no time.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.052
Lover, can I borrow your pocket square?

05:45.053 --> 05:46.196
Use your hand!

05:48.598 --> 05:51.201
- I think you need to go back inside.
- But away from me.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.875
- Then where should I go?
- The daycare center.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.164
What? Babies are always sick.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.753
Have you seen Cesar?

06:04.114 --> 06:06.073
Not yet. But you know Cesar.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.468
Dude takes forever to
primp. Bet he's on his way.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.249
- "Bet he's on his way?" Why say that?
- So she wouldn't worry.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.750
But he's not coming.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.836
- We should've showed her the typo.
- What's that gonna do?

06:18.837 --> 06:21.755
Distraction. Some people like
taking their mind off what's big

06:21.756 --> 06:23.400
by sweating the small stuff.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.802
Jesus Christ!

06:27.721 --> 06:28.822
Amen.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.556
They're the wrong font.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.017
They were supposed to be printed
in Palatino, not Helvetica.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.186
- Now I can't unsee that.
- We gotta tell Olivia.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.606
- I don't think she'll even notice.
- No! About Cesar.

06:38.607 --> 06:41.334
- She needs to know. He's not coming.
- But he's already here.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.629
Give me some of those.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.416
Talk!

06:58.418 --> 07:00.002
Talk to me, Lil' Ricky.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.503
I know you were smart.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.339
You... You were the smartest.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.758
So, there's something I'm not seeing.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.820
Some clue that's still left hidden.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.030
Tell me.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.448
What am I missing?

07:16.603 --> 07:19.271
I tell you what I'm not missing,
your music career.

07:20.231 --> 07:23.043
You feel me, girl?
Some things are better left in a drawer.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.171
Sorry. Too soon.

08:01.523 --> 08:04.375
These crappy rhymes are nursery rhymes.

08:05.527 --> 08:09.422
Ring-a-round... the Rosie.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.344
Ew. Oh.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.346
God.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.433
Screw it.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.714
Congratulations, mija.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.441
Thanks, Ms. Garcia.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.276
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.678
You looked incredible out there.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.847
That's good to know because
my knees are wrecked.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.765
- Kneeling for an hour is not a blessing.
- But you are blessed.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.018
And officially a woman.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.394
- Feel different?
- Yeah!

08:40.395 --> 08:43.731
I want to vote, and change the
world, and bear children, and...

08:43.732 --> 08:45.875
No, not even a little.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.712
And you? Everything okay?

08:50.572 --> 08:52.882
- As good as it gets.
-  Mija, over here.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.494
Give me a minute. I'm almost done.

08:58.997 --> 09:02.183
It was a nice ceremony.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.102
Yeah.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.047
You didn't kill him.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.148
Monse!

09:10.050 --> 09:13.444
He's not dead, but... he's gone.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.864
What does that mean?

09:17.640 --> 09:20.160
But I didn't shoot. I didn't shoot, man.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.603
- You should've.
- Come on, man. Come on, man.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.438
You don't have to do this, man.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.773
Don't tell me what to do!

09:25.774 --> 09:28.918
Come on, man. I don't want to die.
There's got to be another way.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.752
There is.

09:31.613 --> 09:35.240
Well, I'll do whatever
you want, man. Whatever.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.200
Disappear.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.868
For sure. For sure, man.
I'll dip. Just don't kill me.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.244
Tonight. Leave tonight.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.288
Can't tell anyone you're going
or where you're going to.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.549
You just gotta go. Evaporate.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.711
I got some people out in Florida. I can
go there. My homie just got out...

09:47.712 --> 09:50.982
- Don't bullshit me!
- I'm not! You have the burner! Calm down!

09:52.383 --> 09:53.759
Then it's done.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.903
We're even.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.700
All right. I'll dip.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.246
Wait, no. You can't bounce.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.306
Your homies gonna know nothing happened.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.878
You got to make it look legit.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.797
They got to smell it on you.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.657
Wait, what?

10:16.658 --> 10:19.385
The burner. Shoot it into the can.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.079
Once that goes off, run.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.957
Take your hoodie off too 'cause there
ain't gonna be no blood. Feel me?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.058
Hoodie up.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.562
Burner up.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.759
 Ay, qué lindos.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.238
Come on, Ruby.
Help your dad pack the car.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.990
- Come on!
- I do need help.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.726
With your mother. Not the car.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.727
Give me a minute.

10:45.728 --> 10:49.273
If Latrelle's not dead,
doesn't that leave you vulnerable?

10:49.274 --> 10:52.043
It's handled.
And we never talk about it again.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.863
Now this is Olivia's day,
and if I were you,

10:55.864 --> 10:57.924
I'd be more worried about
those dance steps.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.927
Ruby! Por favor.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.638
I'll see you guys back at the house.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.185
Hey.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.422
Oh, no. No, no, no.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.233
I was so worried.

11:22.807 --> 11:23.907
Tape.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.159
Tape!

11:34.027 --> 11:35.336
This is it, baby.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.426
This is it.

11:45.955 --> 11:51.960
"Ring around... the Rosé."

11:51.961 --> 11:55.130
This was Frankie's high
school championship ring.

11:55.131 --> 11:59.027
Proudest moment of their lives
was winning that football game.

11:59.510 --> 12:04.097
"Pocket full of... posies."

12:04.098 --> 12:07.059
Go here. Mr. Greenthumb Nursery.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.686
"Ashes! Ashes!"

12:09.687 --> 12:14.441
Benito's family owned a smoke
shop I... used to walk by.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.110
And when it burned down,
they couldn't afford to rebuild.

12:17.111 --> 12:21.924
Juanita... this rhyme is the map.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.326
Ring-a-round the Rosie is for Frankie.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.411
Pocket full of Posies is Lil' Ricky.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.973
And ashes to ashes is Benito.

12:30.500 --> 12:36.064
This was a way for them and only them
to decode where the money was buried.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.566
And so the last line is the jackpot.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.778
It's where the money is buried.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.989
We all fall down.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.992
Come on, Jamal.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.162
What is it?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.757
We all fall down!

13:10.206 --> 13:11.432
Let's get it, girl.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.919
 We got a full house.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.522
You ready to get this party started?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.799
- Agh!
- I think I might have to go home.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.984
What's wrong with you?

13:22.719 --> 13:24.761
I don't know. I just keep passing out.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.723
You have to rally. I can wear gloves.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.391
I'm down with that.

13:29.392 --> 13:33.353
It's about to get dirty up in... here.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.980
Jasmine!

13:34.981 --> 13:36.958
Taste my juicy nalga!

13:37.608 --> 13:39.877
Dos quesadillas por favor.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.863
Can someone escort Jasmine home?

13:42.864 --> 13:43.780
No.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.915
Buenas noches.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.145
Ladies, follow me to the kitchen.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.149
Mijo, where are we gonna
set up the buffet?

14:01.466 --> 14:03.467
- On the tables in the back.
- But they're not there.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.260
What? Well, who moved them?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.929
- A guy told me he needed them.
- It was the fireworks guy.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.407
We're having fireworks?

14:10.600 --> 14:11.767
Thank you.

14:11.768 --> 14:15.395
Thank you, everyone,
for spoiling the surprise.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.023
Yes, fireworks. At 9:30.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.484
Someone get his panties out of a bunch.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.695
Take the food out.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.030
Nothing's spoiled.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.949
Oh, no, we're just down
a dama and a chambelan.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.994
- And one of your surprises is ruined.
- One of my surprises?

14:30.995 --> 14:33.497
Yes. But that's all I'm giving
you until it's spoiled...

14:33.498 --> 14:35.999
which it undoubtedly will be.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.603
This day is cursed.
I'm telling you, it's cursed.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.838
The only upshot is that our D
to C numbers are even again.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.007
D to C numbers? Is
that dick to coochie...

14:44.008 --> 14:47.135
Get your head out the gutter!
Damas to chambelanes.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.405
Now Jasmine's out,
you get to dance with me.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.690
My prayers have been answered.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.911
Everyone, assume your positions.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.081
Looks great.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.923
Can you give me a sec?
I need to fix my dress.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.883
Cesar, can you help me?

15:14.122 --> 15:15.306
Where's the trouble?

15:15.832 --> 15:16.932
Here.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.168
This is my bad.
I'm sorry I was MIA yesterday.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.920
You don't have to explain anything.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.190
If I don't hear from you,
there's a good reason.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.944
I know you weren't intentionally
keeping anything from me,

15:28.636 --> 15:31.739
but I feel like I'm keeping
something from you.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.703
I'm not really feeling this. Us.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.772
- Oh.
- My heart's not in it.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.377
And if you're being honest,
I don't think yours is either.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.529
Truth is, you've all become my family

15:47.530 --> 15:49.281
and this place has started
to feel like home.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.700
- I don't want to mess that up.
- You're not gonna mess anything up.

15:51.701 --> 15:52.742
And neither are you,

15:52.743 --> 15:55.638
because I don't know what's
going on with you...

15:56.456 --> 15:57.682
but Monse does.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.253
The party's ruined!
It's a total disaster.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.921
- What's going on?
- There's no horse.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.233
- Okay.
- Okay?

16:07.842 --> 16:10.051
How are you gonna get
pulled in your carriage?

16:10.052 --> 16:13.614
Wait. Maybe we can get Jasmine to
come back. She's crazy strong.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.743
We're so jacked! And do you smell that?

16:18.060 --> 16:20.830
Some asshole's getting lit in
the middle of all of this.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.111
Can you please...

16:28.112 --> 16:29.321
Ocupado.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.597
Okay, everyone out here now.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.290
We're 20 minutes and counting
from the presentation,

16:40.291 --> 16:43.102
and after a little second-hand high,
I'm starting to chill.

16:43.586 --> 16:44.836
We're gonna do a little improvising.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.880
Monse, remember the
walking pas de bourrée

16:46.881 --> 16:48.298
we were gonna incorporate
into the dance?

16:48.299 --> 16:50.050
- No.
- We're gonna do those

16:50.051 --> 16:54.363
so we can give Olivia and Cesar a
proper entrance without the carriage.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.140
- I'm not dancing with Cesar.
- What?

16:57.141 --> 16:59.017
- Why?
- We just broke up.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.478
Are you kidding me?
This whole day is falling apart.

17:01.479 --> 17:04.356
- Cesar, your timing is terrible.
- She dumped me.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.690
We dumped each other.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.431
If you're not gonna dance with Cesar,
who are you gonna dance with?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.338
You.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.259
Have you ever seen Ruby so happy?

17:32.260 --> 17:34.135
Not since he got hair under his arms.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.221
- Last year.
- You mean, last week?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.251
I'm surprised you're not
feeling more guilty.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.060
About what?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.204
My breakup.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.706
Why would I feel guilty?

17:47.108 --> 17:48.358
Because it was over you.

17:49.694 --> 17:50.794
We're up.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.230
Ricky, where the hell did you put it?

18:10.881 --> 18:12.274
I know it's here.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.362
But where's it buried?

18:20.850 --> 18:22.076
Shit.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.290
It's on the other side.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.887
Oh, your hair is falling.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.103
Here. Let me...

18:50.963 --> 18:52.047
Do you know what you're doing?

18:52.048 --> 18:54.507
I know I don't seem like I
know what I'm doing, but...

18:54.508 --> 18:57.153
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Show me where it is.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.745
- Does it look messy?
- Nope.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.372
Looks perfect. Like you.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.916
Thanks for having my back.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.504
Cesar and I are just friends.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.216
Are you trying to make me
believe that or yourself?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.826
I'm not trying to do anything
or start anything...

19:21.827 --> 19:23.804
But it started before I got here.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.016
Cesar's the guy from summer.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.769
- How do you know that?
- Because I do.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.439
Just like I know you don't know
how to do hair or wear dresses.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.483
I know you, Monse.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.359
And I love you.

19:37.843 --> 19:41.388
So, whatever mixed up sense of
loyalty you're feeling right now,

19:41.389 --> 19:43.449
and I know you're feeling some,

19:43.933 --> 19:46.017
chuck it. Be loyal to you.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.412
Stop trying to please everybody but you.

19:49.397 --> 19:50.915
Life's too short.

19:51.482 --> 19:52.708
Be with Cesar.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.252
Consider it your birthday gift to me.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.594
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need her.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.143
Okay. I only have two
minutes to explain,

20:11.877 --> 20:15.356
but I have this other surprise
that surprisingly no one spoiled.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.484
I guess because no one knows.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.364
We got to move. This way.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.575
- Where are we going?
- To find better service.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.159
Yes!

20:28.936 --> 20:31.563
So remember when we talked
about that little bit of Texas

20:31.564 --> 20:32.909
and how much you missed your parents?

20:32.910 --> 20:34.566
I already took pictures
with the cutouts.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.294
No! No cutouts. The real thing.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.572
I got a smartphone to your
parents so you could Facetime.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.782
I thought you should see
them on your birthday.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.767
Pick it up.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.628
Hi!

20:57.047 --> 20:59.358
I love you guys so much.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.485
I miss you too!

21:03.262 --> 21:04.697
I wish you could be here.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.932
Mom? Dad? What happened?

21:07.933 --> 21:11.287
I don't know! I have full bars.
Let me figure this out.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.126
They have bad service.
They'll call back in 20.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.779
- I can't believe this.
- I know.

21:20.780 --> 21:24.324
- Bad reception is a global epidemic.
- No... this.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.410
The call. It's all too much.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.931
- You don't want to talk to them?
- No, I do. Of course I do.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.724
I just...

21:34.460 --> 21:36.729
I don't understand why
you're so good to me.

21:38.172 --> 21:40.024
Why can't I just be good to you?

21:43.803 --> 21:46.113
Don't do that. You're
ruining your makeup.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.640
I don't care. It's my birthday.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.308
I actually think you
look better without it.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.935
Not that you look bad with it.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.636
- I mean, that's not what I'm saying.
- I know what you're saying.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.416
- You do?
- And it's charming.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.208
It is?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.755
I mean, I know.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.240
I was just feigning insecurity.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.383
It's all a bit.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.885
Part of the long play.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.887
'Cause someday, Olivia...

22:10.454 --> 22:14.350
Someday you're not gonna be
able to keep your hands off me.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.507
Why'd you do that?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.860
'Cause sometimes you
got to seize the day.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.029
Yeah.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.449
Sometimes you do.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.593
- Can I cut in?
- No.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.786
- No?
- No!

22:58.252 --> 23:00.688
- You give up easy.
- No, I don't.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.340
- You just don't know when to give up.
- Now you're contradicting yourself.

23:04.341 --> 23:07.861
- I give up easy or not know when to?
- Shut up and dance with me.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.287
You realize we're slow dancing.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.582
- I do.
- And it's in public.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.253
I know.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.926
I'm tired of hiding, Cesar.

23:33.287 --> 23:34.387
Then don't.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.455
This is some bullshit!

24:30.302 --> 24:31.862
I can hear you, Ricky.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.490
I hear you laughing.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.244
I hear you calling me a loser.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.539
And you know what?

24:43.524 --> 24:44.875
You're right.

24:46.777 --> 24:48.462
'Cause I'm cutting my losses...

24:49.863 --> 24:51.423
and I'm getting out of here.

24:54.660 --> 24:55.760
I'm done.

24:57.371 --> 24:58.764
This is nothing.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.266
You are nothing.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.895
Nothing but a figment of my imagination.

25:05.671 --> 25:10.150
You were just a bad rapping,
weird-cousin-having punk!

25:13.512 --> 25:16.114
I'm not gonna dig with
my bare hands, ese.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.659
You're not gonna get the best of me!

25:57.431 --> 25:58.699
Look at that pimp stick.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.562
I miss Jamal. I got to apologize.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.875
You will. But right
now, you got to dance.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.626
Then this one's for Jamal.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.837
For Jamal!

26:51.193 --> 26:52.794
Cesar!

27:05.707 --> 27:07.416
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

27:07.417 --> 27:10.044
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! No!

27:10.045 --> 27:11.963
Mijo! Mijo!

27:13.465 --> 27:14.565
No!

27:16.009 --> 27:20.137
- Mijo?
- Call 911! Call 911!

27:20.138 --> 27:22.074
Ruby!

27:22.432 --> 27:25.768
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be okay, Ruby. Okay...

27:25.769 --> 27:28.288
Not my baby. Not my baby!

27:29.606 --> 27:30.707
Ruby...

27:31.775 --> 27:35.111
Ruby! Ruby.

27:35.112 --> 27:36.880
Mija, stay still.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.035
Ruby! Ruby!
