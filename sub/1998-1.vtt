00:18.400 --> 00:21.336
In the 16th Century,
the mystic John Dee

00:21.337 --> 00:25.239
wrote the "Sigillum Aemeth",
a book of musical chants

00:25.240 --> 00:27.843
that were meant to summon angels,

00:27.844 --> 00:30.946
but brought forth demons instead.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.849
Fearing the unholy power
of his dark songs,

00:33.850 --> 00:37.624
Dee tried to destroy
the book, but failed.

00:38.087 --> 00:41.122
Sought by sorcerers and
dark rulers for centuries,

00:41.123 --> 00:42.391
the book had been lost...

00:45.862 --> 00:47.765
Until now.

00:57.707 --> 01:01.977
Bequeath protection
upon thine followers

01:01.978 --> 01:07.889
who walketh in the footsteps
of Vinsibas Aroptum.

01:09.284 --> 01:12.153
Vinsibas Aroptum.

01:29.639 --> 01:34.949
And your appeasement of
the gods of Vinsibas...

01:36.378 --> 01:38.179
Have failed.

01:38.180 --> 01:40.952
What seven blood packs
not enough, Ronnie?

01:41.017 --> 01:43.851
Yeah, this shit's never coming
out of my tunic, by the way.

01:43.852 --> 01:44.986
I don't know what to
tell you guys, okay?

01:44.987 --> 01:46.089
The appeasement...
The appeasement fails?

01:46.523 --> 01:48.322
- It's bullshit.
- You failed, Eric.

01:48.323 --> 01:50.024
Okay... Maybe if you made
a meaningful sacrifice.

01:50.025 --> 01:51.693
Hey, that's bullshit, Ronnie.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.327
What do you want from me?

01:53.328 --> 01:56.364
We're out here in the woods
in the middle of the night.

01:56.365 --> 01:58.099
We got our robs on...
We nailed the chant.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.535
Come on.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.169
We had everything the
game plan laid out.

02:01.170 --> 02:03.672
It's time that you leveled us up.

02:03.673 --> 02:05.977
You can't just keep failing
my appeasements forever.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.508
- I'm sorry...
- F you, Hung.

02:08.509 --> 02:11.345
The appeasement fails because
Eric wasn't meaning it.

02:11.346 --> 02:13.181
- He wasn't being meaningful.
- Bullshit, Ronnie.

02:13.182 --> 02:15.183
Shut up, Hung, I don't know
what to tell you guys.

02:15.184 --> 02:16.887
Sometimes I don't know who's
harder to appease, Ronnie.

02:16.953 --> 02:18.854
- The gods of Vinsibas or you.
- If you don't stop

02:18.855 --> 02:21.189
complaining, the gods of Vinsibas are
going to curse all your characters

02:21.190 --> 02:22.256
with a case of evil herpes!

02:22.257 --> 02:23.356
- Bullshit!
- Eric, you failed.

02:23.357 --> 02:24.425
- What the fuck?
- Maybe if you made

02:24.426 --> 02:25.594
a meaningful sacrifice.

02:25.595 --> 02:29.864
Guys, how will we taste triumph at
Evermore with this weak bullshit?

02:29.865 --> 02:33.640
Fear not, Sir Reginald, for
I have just the magic needed.

02:34.604 --> 02:37.876
Excuse me while I whipith this out.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.713
What was that?

02:43.613 --> 02:44.881
Hey, Dude, what's that?

02:44.882 --> 02:46.115
What?

02:46.116 --> 02:47.381
Oh shit!

02:47.382 --> 02:48.718
That hurts.

02:52.287 --> 02:53.723
Eat paint, haunted fuckers!

02:56.826 --> 02:57.927
Help... Help!

02:58.761 --> 03:02.464
This'll teach you to play your
fucking wizard game in our woods.

03:02.465 --> 03:03.732
Yeah, run!

03:03.733 --> 03:05.801
Run, you freaks...
And don't ever come back.

03:05.802 --> 03:06.903
Ah!

03:21.350 --> 03:23.120
Hey, check this shit out.

03:23.987 --> 03:25.521
Harry Pooper dropped his book.

03:29.258 --> 03:31.361
Yeah, tear that shit.

03:36.833 --> 03:38.800
Come on, man...
just destroy the book.

03:38.801 --> 03:39.902
Rip it open.

03:46.843 --> 03:47.944
What the fuck?

03:48.377 --> 03:50.982
Get it off... Fuck... get it off!

04:00.557 --> 04:03.328
Fuck... Jesus motherfucker.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.064
The book fucked up your face.

04:16.738 --> 04:18.372
Be strong, Sir Reginald.

04:18.373 --> 04:20.142
Be strong, I say.

04:21.878 --> 04:23.146
Oh ma...

04:26.749 --> 04:28.017
Fuck.

04:29.085 --> 04:30.185
Shit!

04:30.186 --> 04:32.352
- We gotta go back for the book.
- What book?

04:32.353 --> 04:35.524
I brought that kickass old book
I was gonna use for my spells!

04:35.525 --> 04:36.592
Fuck!

04:36.593 --> 04:39.027
I must have dropped it when
those paintballers attacked us!

04:39.028 --> 04:40.296
Shit!

04:44.399 --> 04:46.267
- Fuck!
- Is this it?

04:46.268 --> 04:48.070
That's it.

04:48.071 --> 04:49.172
Whoo... Thank God.

04:50.740 --> 04:52.175
Sorry about freaking out.

04:52.176 --> 04:53.875
No problem.

04:53.876 --> 04:57.015
Ronnie Kwok, he's gonna
shit when he sees that.

04:58.615 --> 05:00.882
We'll be back, you
redneck cocksuckers.

05:00.883 --> 05:01.984
This I vow.

05:45.161 --> 05:46.496

- What?

05:46.896 --> 05:49.598
- Turn this music off!
- I can't hear you.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.700
Joe, come on.

05:51.433 --> 05:52.534
Come on.

05:54.737 --> 05:56.172
You are this close.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.242
How close?

06:00.977 --> 06:02.244
Damn, man.

06:02.245 --> 06:03.681
That shit is tight.

06:03.946 --> 06:08.016
It's called "Your Heart Sucks My Soul."
It's kind of a love song, you know?

06:08.017 --> 06:09.284
Mm-hmm.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.320
I wrote it as a surprise for Beth.

06:11.321 --> 06:12.422
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:12.822 --> 06:16.925
Listen, if that song doesn't
say love and commitment,

06:16.926 --> 06:18.696
I don't know what does.

06:19.329 --> 06:20.996
We need to have a talk.

06:20.997 --> 06:22.597
I'm actually way ahead of you.

06:22.598 --> 06:24.701
How about you, me,
dinner, tonight?

06:25.802 --> 06:27.237
Somewhere with a tablecloth?

06:28.004 --> 06:31.039
I got a little something
special I want to give you.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.141
Wait.

06:32.842 --> 06:34.176
Don't tell me it's...

06:34.177 --> 06:36.615
Is it what I think it is?

06:36.979 --> 06:38.080
No.

06:38.548 --> 06:39.883
Yes.

06:41.050 --> 06:42.684
I don't know...
What do you think it is?

06:42.685 --> 06:46.258
Don't do anything big
involving jewelry, okay?

06:47.223 --> 06:48.990
I mean, I need to
concentrate on my career.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.324
It's not the right thing for
that sort of commitment.

06:50.325 --> 06:51.560
Oh, no, no, I get it.

06:51.561 --> 06:52.828
Whoa.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.930
It's cool.

06:54.230 --> 06:55.331
It's cool.

06:55.565 --> 06:57.666
I mean, why mess with
a good thing, right?

06:57.667 --> 06:58.935
Time out here, Joe.

07:00.470 --> 07:01.703
You're breaking up with me.

07:01.704 --> 07:03.406
Will you listen to me?

07:03.873 --> 07:06.541
You have a college degree
in communications studies.

07:06.542 --> 07:07.810
You could be doing
anything you wanted.

07:07.811 --> 07:09.044
Hold up.

07:09.045 --> 07:10.812
I am doing what I want.

07:10.813 --> 07:13.749
You live in a fake castle
leeching off your accidental

07:13.750 --> 07:16.789
millionaire loser friend playing
black metal in your bedroom.

07:17.553 --> 07:18.988
You will never change.

07:18.989 --> 07:20.423
Uh, it's doom metal.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.557
Who the fuck asked you?

07:22.558 --> 07:23.825
Well, he's right.

07:23.826 --> 07:25.596
Gilberto, you're the fucking man.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.296
It was black.

07:27.563 --> 07:29.064
Then we went through
a sludge phase.

07:29.065 --> 07:30.331
Now it's more doom.

07:30.332 --> 07:32.768
I need to focus on my
future, my career.

07:32.769 --> 07:35.604
It's important that I align myself
with successful people, Joe.

07:35.605 --> 07:38.977
I'm sorry, but that's
just how it is.

08:06.536 --> 08:09.037
Hey, dude, where's my plus-3 mace?

08:09.038 --> 08:11.008
Am I thy weapon's keeper?

08:17.380 --> 08:18.481
Hey, man.

08:19.282 --> 08:20.549
Found it!

08:20.550 --> 08:21.651
Oh, hey, dude.

08:22.952 --> 08:24.387
You bent my mace.

08:26.122 --> 08:27.558
That's not-that's not cool.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.025
Sorry, man.

08:32.828 --> 08:34.932
My mom made me this mace.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.269
It's still fierce.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.429
Ahh!

09:43.699 --> 09:44.965
That's a power ballad.

09:44.966 --> 09:46.201
What's wrong with him?

09:46.202 --> 09:47.470
Oh.

09:47.471 --> 09:48.839
She dumped you, didn't she?

09:50.907 --> 09:52.173
Fuck off!

09:52.174 --> 09:53.275
Whoa, nice shot.

09:54.210 --> 09:56.982
So your body is already
subconsciously moving on.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.015
I knew that this day would come.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.817
You had a vision of her just
ripping out my heart, huh?

10:02.818 --> 10:04.052
Yeah.

10:04.053 --> 10:05.887
Thanks for the heads
up, mighty warlock.

10:05.888 --> 10:07.658
I'm a 26-level wizard, buddy.

10:07.857 --> 10:08.924
I know that you know that

10:08.925 --> 10:10.592
and you're just tying
to be hurtful.

10:10.593 --> 10:11.693
Fucking Beth.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.762
Dude, look, I'm sorry for
what happened, but you two

10:13.763 --> 10:16.532
hadn't been right for each
other for a long time.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.033
It's only the rejection that hurts.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.469
You'll get over that.

10:19.602 --> 10:20.703
Maybe she's right.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.772
Maybe...

10:23.773 --> 10:25.407
I should be making some changes.

10:25.408 --> 10:26.741
Maybe I should move out of here.

10:26.742 --> 10:28.845
No, there's no need for drama.

10:29.211 --> 10:32.316
You always have a place
here at meine castle.

10:32.782 --> 10:34.215
I still love her.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.518
We can't leave him like this.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.953
I know.

10:37.954 --> 10:39.289
I'll be fine... Just go.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.826
Go... Kill your fake dragons.

11:05.047 --> 11:06.148
This is awkward.

11:06.949 --> 11:08.351
I know what you need.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.519
Come on.

11:12.788 --> 11:14.825
Come on!

11:22.298 --> 11:23.399
Uh-uh.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.967
I told you, I don't do
that shit any more.

11:25.968 --> 11:29.572
Yeah and the reason you quit
just kicked you to the curb.

11:29.573 --> 11:32.073
So I think it's high time that
you got back in the saddle.

11:32.074 --> 11:33.609
It's a sativa, dude.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.715
It'll lift your spirits
but not knock you out.

11:38.347 --> 11:39.783
Just do it... it's nothing.

11:45.489 --> 11:46.590
Okay.

12:46.882 --> 12:48.316
I love you.

12:48.317 --> 12:50.320
I love you too, Joe.

13:01.063 --> 13:03.100
Sweet Jesus.

13:14.176 --> 13:15.277
Wait.

13:16.846 --> 13:17.947
Oh no.

13:54.618 --> 13:56.387
Fuck me.

14:02.958 --> 14:06.999
Aye, Sir Dragoroth have
been detained by Minerva.

14:07.830 --> 14:08.931
...The sea hag.

14:09.766 --> 14:13.434
His bewitchment by the siren's
song shall be the nail

14:13.435 --> 14:16.905
thine army wantst,
King Diamond the Red.

14:16.906 --> 14:18.007
We shall see.

14:18.642 --> 14:19.908
Until Evermore.

14:19.909 --> 14:21.177
'Til Evermore.

14:23.012 --> 14:24.113
Eric!

14:24.681 --> 14:26.016
Hung!

14:34.356 --> 14:35.524
Where the fuck are we?

14:35.525 --> 14:38.931
'Tis the kingdom of
Eliphaz, my naive friend.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.335
You shanghaied me and dressed me.

14:47.336 --> 14:48.537
Aye.

14:48.538 --> 14:49.971
It just felt right.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.140
Adventuring is exactly
what thou needst.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.474
"Needst" is not a word.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.710
Where we are, it is.

14:54.711 --> 14:56.547
I'm taking this shit off.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.548
Whoa!

14:59.549 --> 15:01.650
Now is not the time
to lose thy nerve,

15:01.651 --> 15:03.151
brave and scorned warrior.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.287
Thou has been recruited to
fight in the glorious army

15:06.288 --> 15:07.523
of Kabedrah.

15:07.524 --> 15:10.128
The epic battle of Evermore.

15:13.697 --> 15:15.734
Come, Sir Hung.

15:32.482 --> 15:33.883
That looks terrible.

15:33.884 --> 15:36.150
My three-year-old nephew
could make a better map.

15:36.151 --> 15:37.587
He's got learning disabilities.

15:39.656 --> 15:40.856
It'll have to do.

15:42.559 --> 15:45.159
You, my friend, are on dragon duty.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.896
Take these...

15:46.897 --> 15:50.671
and make sure that
<i>♪ weeee ♪</i> are good to go.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.501
And Dragon Rider!

15:54.203 --> 15:55.606
Just don't fuck with my stereo.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.381
Grass is nourished by
the blood of heroes.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.651
Hmm?

16:08.551 --> 16:10.118
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

16:10.119 --> 16:11.655
Uh-huh... let's continue.

16:19.194 --> 16:22.734
And here we have Fengyrian Falls.

16:26.937 --> 16:28.038
Oh.

16:28.705 --> 16:32.307
Remember, gentlemen, your
supervision of this script

16:32.308 --> 16:34.208
and the monsters contained within

16:34.209 --> 16:36.377
will make this event come alive.

16:36.378 --> 16:37.713
Follow me now.

16:37.714 --> 16:41.115
Adventures lie waiting
like sleeping dragons!

16:41.116 --> 16:43.051
Hah?

16:50.560 --> 16:53.431
And here we have Novum Castellum!

16:53.964 --> 16:56.130
Ah, each band of
heroes will complete

16:56.131 --> 16:58.234
a Class Three quest this eve.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.335
By gathering at the
plains of Evermore,

17:00.336 --> 17:03.943
the battle betwixt the realms
of King Diamond and Carey.

17:06.075 --> 17:08.142
Though there will be a big
surprise in store for all.

17:10.145 --> 17:14.252
And as game master, I will be
watching over all of this.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.256
You can think of me as God.

17:32.201 --> 17:33.937
Excuse me a minute.

17:42.645 --> 17:43.879
Ah, Gwen.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.983
Just whom I wanted to see.

17:47.282 --> 17:50.452
I have been watching you these
long battle-swept nights

17:50.453 --> 17:53.558
of the campaign and you
have shown your mettle.

17:53.723 --> 17:55.724
So, verily, the time has come

17:55.725 --> 17:58.496
for you to ascend to
the upper realms.

17:59.061 --> 18:00.162
Oh God.

18:00.964 --> 18:02.497
The game hasn't started
already, has it?

18:02.498 --> 18:03.899
- No.
- We don't have to talk

18:03.900 --> 18:06.200
in Dorkinese yet, do we?

18:06.201 --> 18:10.308
I thought maybe you'd want to be
my assistant head game master

18:10.406 --> 18:12.908
and you could be my right
hand, my right hand...

18:12.909 --> 18:14.010
Ow!

18:14.844 --> 18:15.911
Ooh.

18:15.912 --> 18:17.546
I have an idea of
what your right hand

18:17.547 --> 18:19.313
spends a lot of time doing, Ronnie.

18:19.314 --> 18:20.750
That's really personal, Gwen.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.250
Come, Gunther.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.092
I'll take that as a no for now.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.765
- You okay?
- Shut your mouth.

18:37.332 --> 18:38.635
Onward.

18:39.502 --> 18:40.603
Shut your mouth.

18:44.074 --> 18:45.908
Where the fuck are the keys?

18:45.909 --> 18:47.010
Two floors.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.148
Whoa.

18:56.953 --> 18:58.587
Hey.

18:58.588 --> 19:01.025
Thought you guys only
used foam weapons.

19:01.591 --> 19:03.360
In this world, young Jonen,

19:03.860 --> 19:06.595
you can only put
your trust in steel.

19:06.596 --> 19:10.369
My elite clientele is willing to
pay a premium for authenticity.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.004
Where the fuck are the keys?

19:14.269 --> 19:15.537
Come on, Joe.

19:15.538 --> 19:16.972
You played D&D.

19:16.973 --> 19:18.634
Live action role play
is the next level.

19:19.274 --> 19:21.076
D&D was a long time ago.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.945
Yeah... And you were a legend.

19:22.946 --> 19:24.079
These people here?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.482
They sing songs about
the time that you gave

19:26.483 --> 19:29.020
Ronnie Kwok's paladin
demonic syphilis.

19:36.126 --> 19:39.427
Do you remember... remember when
we caught Ronnie spanking it

19:39.428 --> 19:42.296
to the succubus picture in
the old monster manual?

19:42.297 --> 19:43.599
Good times, man.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.399
Yeah, and some of us
are still having 'em.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.735
Come on!

19:46.736 --> 19:48.770
Eric's about to level
up to Grand Sorcerer.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.208
I'm packing an ounce
of killer 'shrooms.

19:51.474 --> 19:54.245
And there be monsters
in need of pummelin'!

19:54.644 --> 19:56.612
You have a choice:

19:56.613 --> 19:59.114
Join us in tasting the
sweet nectar of victory

19:59.115 --> 20:02.287
or mope around an empty
house all week like a bitch.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.893
You guys do actually
look slightly badass.

20:10.259 --> 20:11.760
It's like a Metalwolf cover.

20:11.761 --> 20:13.028
- Yeah.
- Without the muscles.

20:13.029 --> 20:14.262
No.

20:17.867 --> 20:18.968
All right.

20:19.268 --> 20:20.502
I'm in.

20:20.503 --> 20:21.604
Huzzah!

20:22.005 --> 20:23.271
Please.

20:23.272 --> 20:24.506
Don't make me rethink this.

20:24.507 --> 20:25.775
Nah.

20:27.544 --> 20:28.645
Owww...

20:34.383 --> 20:38.658
Welcome to the fields of Evermore!

20:45.128 --> 20:46.360
Um, Ronnie?

20:46.361 --> 20:47.629
Yes, Travis.

20:47.630 --> 20:48.996
Where are our costumes?

20:48.997 --> 20:52.034
<i>♪ There is no end to the
tricks up my sleeve ♪</i>

20:52.035 --> 20:53.571
- Wardr'be?
- Yes, sir.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.304
Got it... 42 regular.

20:56.305 --> 20:58.907
42 reg... I think
you'll find it snug.

20:58.908 --> 21:00.374
- Great.
- Freshly laundered.

21:00.375 --> 21:02.044
I'm a trained actor, man.

21:02.045 --> 21:04.617
Not some fucking... stunt monkey.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.584
A weekend improv workshop, my ass.

21:08.651 --> 21:10.052
Ungrateful.

21:10.053 --> 21:11.923
Ah, greetings, enchanter.

21:13.422 --> 21:15.857
I have some surprises
in store for you.

21:15.858 --> 21:19.528
Some creatures with a taste
for flesh of the lowest order.

21:19.529 --> 21:20.596
Hmm?

21:20.597 --> 21:22.664
Parasites, charlatans.

21:22.665 --> 21:24.900
War profiteers of
forbidden weaponry.

21:24.901 --> 21:27.069
Verily, I say... let it go, dude.

21:27.070 --> 21:28.170
Well.

21:28.171 --> 21:31.443
Marketplace is a battlefield and
to the victor go the spoils.

21:31.941 --> 21:33.041
Agreed.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.876
I bring news of a legendary warrior

21:34.877 --> 21:36.510
long absent from this realm

21:36.511 --> 21:39.283
who returnth to replace the
estimable Sir Reginald.

21:40.950 --> 21:44.219
The new warrior is
of course welcome.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.054
Wonderful... Jobreyth of Revitt

21:46.055 --> 21:48.056
shall once more fight by my side.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.891
Joe Revitt's here...
What the frak, Eric?

21:49.892 --> 21:51.893
- I hate that guy.
- Ronald, Ronald,

21:51.894 --> 21:53.228
why be so petty?

21:53.229 --> 21:56.166
I mean, surely, you're not still
sore about your syphilitic paladin.

21:57.366 --> 22:00.068
Perhaps, the pages of
your monster manual

22:00.069 --> 22:02.471
remain stucketh together?

22:08.211 --> 22:09.647
For old time's sake, he's in.

22:10.980 --> 22:12.182
But...

22:14.250 --> 22:16.952
You must accomplish a
level 12 summoning spell

22:16.953 --> 22:19.390
to animate Joe's character
with Reginald's life-force.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.727
Consider it done, my liege.

22:27.563 --> 22:28.998
Okay, that was a bit much.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.367
Show-off.

22:37.507 --> 22:39.276
Lo, the adventure begins!

22:40.243 --> 22:42.013
Please report for
quest assignments.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.882
Step forward when
your group is called.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.901
Heed this reminder.

23:05.535 --> 23:07.202
All guilds must
complete their quest

23:07.203 --> 23:09.306
prior to tomorrow's
battle at Evermore.

23:10.273 --> 23:12.941
Also, Ryan the Necromancer
beseeches thy help

23:12.942 --> 23:14.810
in finding his inhaler.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.345
What... Oh.

23:16.346 --> 23:18.082
His inhaler of doom!

23:19.148 --> 23:21.950
And to the owner of the
sperm-white Toyota Tercel,

23:21.951 --> 23:24.186
thy chariot is blocking
the witches' coven.

23:24.187 --> 23:28.056
Move it or you'll be faced with
a hex of great dark magic.

23:28.057 --> 23:29.459
And you'll be towed.

23:49.812 --> 23:51.580
It's a lot like you remember it,

23:51.581 --> 23:53.749
except instead of
sitting around a table,

23:53.750 --> 23:55.550
we do it for real.

23:55.551 --> 23:56.818
For fake.

23:56.819 --> 23:58.053
Fake-real, dude.

23:58.054 --> 23:59.322
Don't fuck with me.

23:59.323 --> 24:02.324
And this fake-real
involves, uh, yoga?

24:02.325 --> 24:04.025
Laugh now, but a
structured warm-up routine

24:04.026 --> 24:05.461
helps prevent injury later.

24:06.428 --> 24:08.198
All right... I'll show you.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.533
Come on.

24:13.403 --> 24:14.504
What?

24:14.771 --> 24:15.872
All right.

24:16.572 --> 24:18.240
Arms and legs, one point.

24:18.241 --> 24:19.342
Torso's two.

24:20.009 --> 24:23.448
Limb takes a hit, it's useless
until healing's been cast.

24:23.579 --> 24:26.014
Parry disarm can be
used once per melee

24:26.015 --> 24:28.417
unless you're up against
a two-handed weapon.

24:28.418 --> 24:30.321
Grab your sword, I'll demonstrate.

24:56.212 --> 24:57.412
Finish him!

25:14.564 --> 25:15.630
Got an idea.

25:15.631 --> 25:17.165
How about I just forget the count

25:17.166 --> 25:19.334
- and start wailing on people!
- Dude!

25:19.335 --> 25:20.470
Dude!

25:20.471 --> 25:21.906
It's honor system, Man.

25:22.638 --> 25:24.806
Okay, you're all set
to join the battle.

25:24.807 --> 25:26.308
I just spoke with Ronnie.

25:26.309 --> 25:28.412
- Oh, except lose the sword.
- Huh?

25:29.011 --> 25:30.679
Yeah, newbs don't get swords.

25:30.680 --> 25:31.781
Um.

25:33.015 --> 25:37.122
Wait, I have to earn the
right to carry a foam stick?

25:37.420 --> 25:41.491
'Tis not the size of the young
knave's blade, but the lust

25:41.492 --> 25:43.929
in his thrust by which
legends are made.

25:46.028 --> 25:47.596
Oh!

25:47.597 --> 25:48.698
Jobreyth!

25:49.332 --> 25:52.538
There is one more thing
you're going to need to do.

26:03.212 --> 26:04.779
Verily?

26:04.780 --> 26:07.716
- This is retarded.
- Guys, pentagrams?

26:07.717 --> 26:09.384
Man, we don't roll that
way here, all right?

26:09.385 --> 26:11.786
This is the LARP, not the
Wicker Man Wiccan cosplay.

26:11.787 --> 26:13.089
Nay.

26:14.491 --> 26:15.960
'Tis in the book, dude.

26:18.227 --> 26:19.495
Okay.

26:24.066 --> 26:25.167
Um, Eric.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.574
They be the rest of our
traveling companions.

26:31.073 --> 26:34.512
Stand back and witness the
spectacle of my animation spell.

26:37.713 --> 26:39.482
- Ready?
- Oh, for God's sake.

27:40.376 --> 27:42.914
Ahh!

27:46.983 --> 27:48.084
Beth?

27:48.918 --> 27:50.253
Beth?

27:52.489 --> 27:54.993
Ahh!

28:06.335 --> 28:07.604
How awesome was that!

28:07.605 --> 28:09.206
A-plus, motherfucker.

28:12.274 --> 28:13.375
Arise, Jobreyth.

28:14.176 --> 28:16.277
Breathe fresh the air once again.

28:18.114 --> 28:19.584
What the fuck was that... it hurt.

28:21.283 --> 28:23.451
Methinks you should not
be so much of a pussy.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.987
Don't tell me you've never
played with fireworks before.

28:25.988 --> 28:27.355
Not like that.

28:27.356 --> 28:30.930
What was with the faces,
the smells, everything?

28:31.628 --> 28:32.729
What was that?

28:33.630 --> 28:35.631
I tell you what I see.

28:35.632 --> 28:36.733
A warrior...

28:39.636 --> 28:42.073
who can't let go of his past.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.408
What are you doing?

28:46.476 --> 28:47.709
Wow.

28:47.710 --> 28:48.977
What was that?

28:48.978 --> 28:50.211
Ex-girlfriend!

28:50.212 --> 28:51.313
Jobryeth needeth closure!

28:52.549 --> 28:53.984
It's not like that.

28:54.383 --> 28:55.850
'Tis no matter to me, apprentice.

28:55.851 --> 28:58.555
What the shit is going on?
Why is there smoke?

28:59.489 --> 29:02.390
Eric, I said a basic summoning
spell, not one of your

29:02.391 --> 29:04.059
non-regulation
pyrotechnic displays.

29:04.060 --> 29:06.832
This was more befitting
a 27th level sorcerer.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.767
Which you are not yet.

29:11.535 --> 29:12.636
What's up, Joe?

29:14.070 --> 29:16.608
Needst I remindst thou

29:16.640 --> 29:18.306
the Temple of Syrinx awaits.

29:18.307 --> 29:19.542
Don't be a buzzkill, Ronnie.

29:19.543 --> 29:20.809
Ah.

29:20.810 --> 29:22.145
Come, Gunther.

29:25.748 --> 29:27.015
<i>♪ Buzzkill ♪</i>

29:27.016 --> 29:28.249
What?

29:28.250 --> 29:31.155
<i>♪ Buzzkill ♪</i>

29:47.403 --> 29:49.370
How you doing there, Captain Trips?

29:49.371 --> 29:50.539
Verily.

29:50.607 --> 29:52.710
There be a fungus among us.

29:53.843 --> 29:56.615
Is it your fungus
that's fucking with me?

29:56.779 --> 30:00.115
'Cause if you did slip me some
'shrooms, why's it feel like

30:00.116 --> 30:02.551
I got bent over and taken
advantage of back there?

30:02.552 --> 30:04.989
Perhaps thine reach exceeds
thy grasp, "vizard".

30:05.555 --> 30:07.658
So who are our comrades, Enchanter?

30:08.858 --> 30:09.959
Right.

30:10.192 --> 30:11.926
That be Lando, the pious.

30:11.927 --> 30:13.462
Watch him in battle...
Complete weasel,

30:13.463 --> 30:14.564
but entertaining.

30:15.264 --> 30:16.532
You'll see.

30:16.533 --> 30:17.866
Sir Gunther, the mighty.

30:17.867 --> 30:19.934
Head case with a big stick.

30:19.935 --> 30:22.237
He is unique and crazy.

30:22.238 --> 30:23.339
And...

30:24.073 --> 30:25.474
And Guinevere the fearless,

30:25.475 --> 30:28.544
who's plus-three ass perfection
should keep the memory

30:28.545 --> 30:30.879
of She Who Shall Not
Be Mentioned at bay.

30:30.880 --> 30:31.981
Plus-three?

30:32.882 --> 30:34.652
Clearly you underestimate
my endowments.

30:38.722 --> 30:40.922
Look, your party has
disturbed a nest!

30:40.923 --> 30:42.157
Demon apes!

30:42.158 --> 30:43.424
What the fuck?

30:43.425 --> 30:44.694
Play on!

30:47.229 --> 30:49.901
One of the beasts deals Sir Hung
the Glutinous a stunning blow!

30:57.808 --> 30:59.076
Haha!

31:01.611 --> 31:03.714
Great way to spend the weekend.

31:04.146 --> 31:06.918
Sweating my balls off
in a monkey outfit.

31:08.350 --> 31:10.220
I don't know where the hell I am.

31:14.256 --> 31:15.323
Wha...

31:15.324 --> 31:16.424
Who's there?

31:16.425 --> 31:18.730
Hello, apelings?

31:25.468 --> 31:27.536
- Dude... Joe! Little help here.
- Huh?

31:27.537 --> 31:30.271
Help us kill some freaking apes!

31:30.272 --> 31:32.042
You here for the LARP?

31:33.442 --> 31:36.982
The live, the LARP?

31:40.115 --> 31:41.483
Do you maybe have a map?

31:41.484 --> 31:43.652
Oh, wow.

31:43.653 --> 31:47.727
'Cause I, um... I sort
of lost my way.

31:49.659 --> 31:52.096
Got separated from the group.

31:56.867 --> 31:58.837
Oh... kay.

32:02.505 --> 32:04.140
Jobryeth!

32:08.678 --> 32:12.284
Gonna... kill... your...
monkey... asses!

32:12.915 --> 32:14.683
Jobryeth takes a lethal
strike to the back!

32:14.684 --> 32:15.917
Huh?

32:15.918 --> 32:18.122
- Bullshit... 'Tis a lie!
- Halt!

32:20.189 --> 32:22.924
Game master saw a palpable
hit and an unconscious man

32:22.925 --> 32:24.593
throwing weaponry... weaponry
that is beyond the expertise

32:24.594 --> 32:26.029
of your lowly character.

32:27.898 --> 32:30.833
I don't understand what you
said, but I'm gonna sit down.

32:30.834 --> 32:32.369
Three, two, one, play on!

32:34.905 --> 32:37.506
Got separated from my group.

32:37.507 --> 32:38.574
You too?

32:38.575 --> 32:42.348
Uh, well, maybe then we should
stick together and both look.

32:43.345 --> 32:44.446
Oh.

32:44.947 --> 32:46.749
Oh, wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

32:46.750 --> 32:49.951
If this is some sort of Fury
fetish, then I don't mind at all!

32:49.952 --> 32:51.053
Oh wow!

32:51.721 --> 32:52.989
Oh wow!

32:59.596 --> 33:02.400
Oh, okay, sure.

33:05.434 --> 33:07.872
From the ground,
thy wounds be bound.

33:08.571 --> 33:10.407
Regeneration spell successful!

33:13.275 --> 33:15.178
Still thy tongue lest I remove it!

33:16.947 --> 33:18.215
Lightning bolt!

33:19.749 --> 33:20.982
Lightning bolt!

33:20.983 --> 33:22.317
You my bitch... Ow!

33:22.318 --> 33:23.754
Same side, same side!

33:23.887 --> 33:25.253
Be gone, demon apes!

33:31.293 --> 33:32.562
Oh shit.

33:34.564 --> 33:35.665
Damn.

33:39.636 --> 33:41.135
Lando has been dealt
a mortal blow.

33:41.136 --> 33:44.910
'Tis a lie... I had a spell
of simian protection up.

33:45.274 --> 33:47.377
Fine, kill the brown guy first.

33:55.986 --> 33:57.820
The great ape has been vanquished!

33:57.821 --> 33:58.922
Huzzah!

33:59.254 --> 34:00.355
Yeah.

34:00.623 --> 34:02.791
Now remember, before
convening at the battle,

34:02.792 --> 34:04.895
this party has a quest to
loot the temple of Syrinx

34:04.995 --> 34:07.496
which needeth completion, so...

34:07.497 --> 34:09.665
Perhaps the party should split
up for to cover more ground.

34:09.666 --> 34:11.099
Capital idea, Sir Lando.

34:11.100 --> 34:13.768
Take Sir Hung the Capable
and explore yon forest

34:13.770 --> 34:15.268
for the fabled temple.

34:15.270 --> 34:17.973
Verily... We shall meet thee
at Evermore if not before.

34:17.974 --> 34:19.541
Godspeed to you and thine servant.

34:19.542 --> 34:20.809
Servant?

34:20.810 --> 34:22.043
I'm an apprentice.

34:22.043 --> 34:23.312
Fucketh you very much.

34:23.513 --> 34:24.612
Easy.

34:24.614 --> 34:27.683
I beseech thee to give him
wide berth as he is pained

34:27.684 --> 34:29.183
by a riven heart torn asunder

34:29.184 --> 34:31.553
by the cruelty of an untrue maiden.

34:31.554 --> 34:33.286
Enough with that shit, please.

34:33.288 --> 34:34.523
Easy, my liege.

34:34.524 --> 34:37.061
I told these guys
that thou were cool.

34:41.531 --> 34:42.632
Ah, at last.

34:43.500 --> 34:46.271
The simpletons and heretics
have left our brotherhood.

34:47.971 --> 34:50.304
However, it occureth to
me that mine apprentice

34:50.304 --> 34:51.406
has forgotten something.

34:51.708 --> 34:52.809
Yo?

34:53.043 --> 34:55.815
Thou must return to the
kingdom of Eliphaz.

34:56.378 --> 34:58.783
- Uh...
- Parking lot.

34:59.248 --> 35:00.349
Parking lot.

35:00.382 --> 35:03.251
And fetch the amulet of
Kokun from our transport,

35:03.252 --> 35:06.688
for it shall be needed at
the battle of Evermore.

35:06.689 --> 35:09.527
So go to the parking lot to
get something you forgot.

35:12.094 --> 35:13.362
Aye.

35:14.363 --> 35:16.698
I shall join you on your mission.

35:16.699 --> 35:19.535
The forest is no place for
an unarmed adventurer.

35:19.536 --> 35:20.769
Let's go.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.205
Act... It's this way.

35:24.173 --> 35:25.541
Yes.

35:32.849 --> 35:34.017
Hey, man.

35:36.285 --> 35:37.719
Attention all teams.

35:37.720 --> 35:41.056
Upon completion of your quests,
you may head to the battlefield

35:41.057 --> 35:43.191
to prepare your camp for the night.

35:43.192 --> 35:46.061
But as always, be on guard
for the evil scourge

35:46.062 --> 35:47.497
from beyond our borders.

35:48.397 --> 35:50.899
You know, those redneck
paintball jerks who crashed

35:50.900 --> 35:52.670
our centaur hunt last week.

35:52.969 --> 35:55.239
Prithee, take care.

36:00.442 --> 36:03.214
Is that you, fellow
denizens of Elves' realms?

36:03.947 --> 36:06.050
Speakers of Elvish?

36:23.133 --> 36:25.571
Um, do you have a map maybe?

36:26.636 --> 36:28.071
Do I know you?

36:29.072 --> 36:31.175
Are you here for the LARP?

36:31.841 --> 36:35.948
Was it the robes or the pointy
ears that gave it away?

36:36.146 --> 36:40.588
'Cause I sort of lost my way and
got separated from the group.

36:40.917 --> 36:42.018
Oh, no.

36:42.519 --> 36:45.290
You're one of those freaky
vampire LARPers, right?

36:45.488 --> 36:46.589
Wrong weekend, honey.

36:47.690 --> 36:49.459
I don't mind at all.

36:51.461 --> 36:55.702
I think thou art marching down
the wrong battlefield, sweetie.

36:56.533 --> 36:58.703
Now if you'll excuse me.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.823
If I didn't know better, Jobryeth,

37:21.824 --> 37:23.859
I'd say you were
having fun back there.

37:23.860 --> 37:25.295
Ooh, no I wasn't.

37:27.163 --> 37:28.497
Okay, a little.

37:28.498 --> 37:29.998
But you can't tell anyone.

37:31.634 --> 37:35.369
I wouldn't even know what LARP
was if it weren't for Gunther.

37:35.370 --> 37:37.473
He's a little hardcore with this.

37:38.575 --> 37:41.346
Well, at least you're supporting
your boyfriend's interests.

37:41.410 --> 37:43.180
- A lot of girls...
- Boyfriend?

37:43.412 --> 37:44.513
God, no.

37:46.082 --> 37:47.484
Gunther's my cousin.

37:49.485 --> 37:52.590
He's a good kid, but he
never breaks character.

37:53.022 --> 37:54.123
Whoa, whoa, wait.

37:55.491 --> 37:56.926
He never breaks character?

37:57.093 --> 38:00.532
He truly believes he's in
another time and a place.

38:03.233 --> 38:06.001
But his folks don't let him
come to these things alone.

38:06.002 --> 38:07.437
So you're warrior-sitting then?

38:07.870 --> 38:10.606
Well, after the Medieval
Times incident,

38:10.607 --> 38:14.243
I seem to be the only
one he listens to.

38:14.244 --> 38:15.680
The Medieval Times incident?

38:18.948 --> 38:21.485
Mom thought it would be
cute to take him there.

38:22.417 --> 38:25.386
He jumped the wall and sent the
Red Knight to the hospital.

38:26.923 --> 38:28.024
Sorry.

38:28.423 --> 38:30.059
Not funny.

38:41.271 --> 38:43.475
I've got this.

39:16.673 --> 39:19.210
Ooh!

39:23.412 --> 39:25.082
Um, miss.

39:27.817 --> 39:28.918
The fuck?

39:30.753 --> 39:33.324
Spell of protection.

39:34.457 --> 39:35.558
It's too late.

39:36.292 --> 39:37.393
Drop.

39:38.161 --> 39:39.764
To the nether realms.

39:54.977 --> 39:56.446
My lady?

40:00.983 --> 40:02.485
Very impressive.

40:05.221 --> 40:07.155
All I'm saying is we'll be
taken more seriously

40:07.156 --> 40:09.624
if we refer to
ourselves as sprites.

40:09.625 --> 40:11.292
Can we please stay in character?

40:11.293 --> 40:12.861
You guys sound like a
bunch of little girls.

40:12.862 --> 40:14.329
If anyone would know
about little girls...

40:14.330 --> 40:15.396
Okay.

40:15.397 --> 40:17.199
I tried to handle this in
private, but if you wanna

40:17.200 --> 40:19.634
do this here and now,
standing in the woods,

40:19.635 --> 40:21.972
dressed like fucking
fairies, so be it.

40:22.004 --> 40:24.441
Lo, perhaps thou art
having thine monthlies.

40:25.341 --> 40:26.575
Out of game.

40:26.576 --> 40:28.011
Out of game? Okay.

40:28.410 --> 40:30.513
Fine... What the
hell's your problem?

40:30.580 --> 40:32.714
You're the one who
wanted to experiment.

40:32.715 --> 40:35.183
Don't blame me if you can't
handle the consequences.

40:35.184 --> 40:37.085
It was fine as long as
it was all about you,

40:37.086 --> 40:38.720
but heaven forbid I enjoy it.

40:38.721 --> 40:40.490
You saw her without me.

40:40.857 --> 40:42.824
That wasn't part of the deal.

40:42.825 --> 40:44.027
I'm heading back to camp.

40:44.761 --> 40:45.861
Go.

40:45.862 --> 40:49.801
Someday someone's gonna tear your heart
out and you'll know exactly how I feel.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.201
Sprites!

40:52.869 --> 40:54.304
Let's fly.

41:30.606 --> 41:32.709
You look like one of those...

41:32.742 --> 41:35.714
freaky vampire LARPers.

41:41.250 --> 41:43.020
Maybe we should stick together.

41:45.888 --> 41:47.825
Maybe.

42:46.949 --> 42:49.718
As you approach the Exalted
Township of Valinore,

42:49.719 --> 42:53.826
you notice that your own path
intersect <i>♪ with another ♪.</i>

42:58.495 --> 43:01.229
Sir Hung, he is rustling
just across the way.

43:01.230 --> 43:04.002
I can hear the breeze on my skin.

43:05.234 --> 43:06.837
'Tis burnt orange.

43:08.070 --> 43:09.337
Bad at English.

43:09.338 --> 43:10.572
The fuck's he saying?

43:10.573 --> 43:11.840
I don't know.

43:11.841 --> 43:13.944
There is electricity in the air.

43:15.978 --> 43:18.580
Okay, Ronnie, so if he goes insane,
can I inherit his experience points?

43:18.581 --> 43:19.680
You're obsessed with
experience points.

43:19.681 --> 43:21.182
No, let's not talk about that now.

43:21.183 --> 43:22.417
I'm just saying, that's
a waste of experience.

43:22.418 --> 43:23.685
I can use it.

43:23.686 --> 43:26.290
Still thy cowardly tongue.

43:27.558 --> 43:29.093
Oh, holy shit.

43:30.826 --> 43:32.929
Prepare thineself
for battle, witch.

43:33.930 --> 43:35.363
Do I know you?

43:35.364 --> 43:37.265
All right, Hung, I don't
know what you're on,

43:37.266 --> 43:38.433
but I think it's
clouding your judgment.

43:38.434 --> 43:40.204
- She looks...
- Nay, game master.

43:41.572 --> 43:45.646
The scales have finally
fallen from mine eyes.

43:52.882 --> 43:54.317
Miss, are you okay?

43:54.951 --> 43:56.217
Have you been in an accident?

43:56.218 --> 43:57.453
'Tis no accident!

43:57.454 --> 43:58.555
Go no closer!

43:59.456 --> 44:02.458
Although I have gazed
upon thine visage before,

44:02.459 --> 44:05.894
'tis only by the light of yon moon

44:05.895 --> 44:10.466
hast thou true nature
revealed itself!

44:10.467 --> 44:13.134
Okay, Hung, ease up there, buddy.
I think she really needs some help.

44:13.135 --> 44:15.036
Excuse me, my lady, do you
really need some help?

44:15.037 --> 44:19.040
Fuck you and the moustache
you rode in on!

44:26.315 --> 44:27.583
Oh, fuck!

44:27.584 --> 44:29.386
I'm... outta here.

44:51.508 --> 44:55.949
'Tis a cruel act of the gods to
waste such a sweet backside...

44:57.747 --> 45:00.384
on such a filthy beast.

46:48.290 --> 46:49.893
It gets me every time.

46:50.627 --> 46:51.728
Huh.

46:52.194 --> 46:53.295
Come here.

47:01.070 --> 47:03.238
The noise came from
around here somewhere.

47:03.239 --> 47:04.909
Just keep your wits.

47:14.416 --> 47:15.685
Oh God.

47:17.419 --> 47:21.326
Oh lord, he's dead.

47:27.062 --> 47:28.163
Oh shit.

47:31.568 --> 47:32.669
What the hell?

47:36.071 --> 47:37.172
I don't understand.

47:39.643 --> 47:41.409
All right, we gotta keep going.

47:41.410 --> 47:45.079
We gotta get Eric, your crazy
cousin and call the cops.

47:47.917 --> 47:50.221
What was that?

47:53.824 --> 47:55.894
Shit.

47:58.961 --> 48:00.731
Joe, what are you doing?

48:00.797 --> 48:02.232
There's someone in there.

48:02.833 --> 48:04.770
I know, that's what
I'm worried about.

48:31.026 --> 48:32.360
You're not gonna
sing, Joe, are you?

48:32.361 --> 48:33.462
What?

48:33.697 --> 48:35.667
Tell me you're not gonna sing.

48:38.234 --> 48:41.073
Not right now, baby.

48:52.849 --> 48:54.786
No, no, no.

48:55.518 --> 48:56.953
No, no, no, no!

48:57.319 --> 48:58.554
Gunther!

48:58.555 --> 48:59.822
Gunther!

48:59.823 --> 49:00.924
Ease up!

49:01.257 --> 49:03.327
Stay your hand, mighty warlord.

49:05.261 --> 49:06.697
Evil has befallen him.

49:07.196 --> 49:08.632
His handiwork is all around us.

49:10.432 --> 49:13.137
We heard you and we thought
it might be whoever...

49:14.871 --> 49:16.373
did this.

49:23.078 --> 49:25.514
Where's... where's Ronnie?

49:25.515 --> 49:26.616
Lando?

49:27.884 --> 49:28.985
Do not enter.

49:29.952 --> 49:31.487
One cannot cheat death forever.

49:41.230 --> 49:43.635
This is not good.

49:47.871 --> 49:50.539
Joe, what the fuck
is going on here?

49:50.540 --> 49:51.774
I don't know what's going on.

49:51.775 --> 49:53.041
But I want to talk to Ronnie.

49:53.042 --> 49:54.275
Ronnie?

49:54.276 --> 49:56.745
You think Ronnie is
responsible for this?

49:56.746 --> 49:58.948
What am I supposed to think?

49:58.949 --> 50:01.386
You guys and your quest
for authenticity.

50:01.584 --> 50:02.818
Oh, come...

50:02.819 --> 50:04.085
Real weapons.

50:04.086 --> 50:05.187
In-game bullshit.

50:05.622 --> 50:06.889
Archaic books.

50:06.890 --> 50:08.993
Ugh, the evil book again, huh?

50:09.391 --> 50:11.259
It would surprise me not, "vizard,"

50:11.260 --> 50:13.595
if thou hath brought forth
something vile and unholy,

50:13.596 --> 50:15.129
a pox upon mankind.

50:15.130 --> 50:16.231
Gunther!

50:20.135 --> 50:21.637
We're out of game here, man.

50:21.638 --> 50:24.172
Somebody tell me what
the hell's going on here.

50:24.173 --> 50:25.943
Hell, indeed, is going on.

50:26.810 --> 50:29.014
The "vizard" has summoned evil.

50:30.613 --> 50:33.849
And most likely while thy apprentice was
in the circle, he has been made unholy.

50:33.850 --> 50:34.951
Gunther.

50:35.417 --> 50:37.318
I cannot tell you whether
'twas man or beast,

50:37.319 --> 50:40.421
but I can tell you surely
it was not Jobryeth.

50:40.422 --> 50:42.156
We need to get out of here.

50:42.157 --> 50:46.194
What we need to do is avenge the
poor souls taken here this eve.

50:46.195 --> 50:47.296
With what?

50:48.030 --> 50:49.131
Foam sticks?

50:49.699 --> 50:50.800
Jobryeth is right.

50:52.502 --> 50:55.607
We need weapons from my
private reserve of steel.

50:57.607 --> 50:58.708
Thou speakests Sense.

51:00.610 --> 51:02.379
Let us return to camp.

51:04.446 --> 51:05.547
And arm ourselves.

51:07.884 --> 51:13.895
While they call for help...
reinforcements.

51:17.059 --> 51:18.160
Very well.

51:20.530 --> 51:21.965
I am watching you.

51:21.998 --> 51:25.672
We all feel safer for that.

51:30.640 --> 51:32.708
Oh fuckity fuck.

51:32.709 --> 51:34.646
Oh my... God!

51:40.850 --> 51:42.083
Get a hold of yourself, man.

51:42.084 --> 51:43.519
Get a hold of yourself, man!

51:43.520 --> 51:45.587
What the fuck was that, man?

51:45.588 --> 51:47.188
Oh my God, she was not normal!

51:47.189 --> 51:50.294
She was like some kind
of she-beast from the...

51:51.326 --> 51:53.862
Oh, my sweet shit.

51:53.863 --> 51:55.764
Oh my sweet, sweet shit.

51:55.765 --> 51:57.432
Eric, you fucking asshole.

51:57.433 --> 51:59.203
I have to warn him.

51:59.869 --> 52:01.137
Where the fuck am I?

52:07.376 --> 52:09.146
They suck at making maps!

52:09.612 --> 52:12.183
Where the hell am I!

52:14.551 --> 52:16.852
Why is there no one here?

52:16.853 --> 52:18.288
Shouldn't someone be here?

52:18.455 --> 52:21.957
Come on, the best way for us to help
is to drive somewhere and get some.

52:21.958 --> 52:23.559
That's not what was agreed upon.

52:23.560 --> 52:25.329
We were to seek vengeance.

52:25.628 --> 52:26.896
Where are the weapons?

52:29.632 --> 52:31.401
Weapons are in here, okay?

52:31.901 --> 52:33.503
Now come on, let's go.

52:42.311 --> 52:44.414
Where the fuck is my phone?

52:44.581 --> 52:45.747
Anyone?

52:47.617 --> 52:48.718
Sweet Jesus, Man.

52:50.587 --> 52:51.688
Sorry, dude.

52:51.988 --> 52:55.093
There's some weird shit
going on out there, man.

52:55.290 --> 52:56.592
Oh... kay.

52:56.593 --> 52:57.826
We gotta call 9-1-1.

52:57.827 --> 52:59.227
Do you have a cell phone?

52:59.228 --> 53:01.329
9-1-1 is just gonna
route a cell call.

53:01.330 --> 53:04.766
What you ought to do is call the
Sky Valley Sheriff directly.

53:04.767 --> 53:06.536
I can get the number.

53:07.436 --> 53:09.437
Call Sky Valley Sheriff.

53:18.781 --> 53:20.281
Sky Valley Sheriff.

53:20.282 --> 53:22.450
There's been an accident at
the state park campgrounds.

53:22.451 --> 53:23.819
You gotta get here
as soon as you can.

53:23.820 --> 53:25.419
Hold up now...
What kind of accident?

53:25.420 --> 53:26.954
Well, there's this
LARP event going on...

53:26.955 --> 53:28.624
Wait a minute, LARP like,
like dressed up

53:28.625 --> 53:31.359
- like wizards and shit?
- Yeah, like that.

53:31.360 --> 53:32.794
But this is serious.

53:32.795 --> 53:35.998
It wasn't just one of those paintballer
pranks, people are in danger.

53:35.999 --> 53:37.633
You stay put...
We'll be right there.

53:37.634 --> 53:38.735
Oh, thank god.

53:39.969 --> 53:41.070
Tommy!

53:41.471 --> 53:43.038
Tommy, get your ass up.

53:43.039 --> 53:44.642
We gotta get going.

53:52.515 --> 53:53.616
Hey, Randy.

53:54.117 --> 53:55.553
Rise and shine, buddy.

53:55.685 --> 53:58.319
We got a cold dish of get
back that needs serving.

53:58.320 --> 53:59.688
Get your cousin and get your gear.

53:59.689 --> 54:01.659
Imma pick you up in 10.

54:11.701 --> 54:15.070
Whoa, this does not look
like regulation game play.

54:15.071 --> 54:17.806
Are you guys out of game or not?

54:17.807 --> 54:21.246
We're so far outta game,
we're somehow back in it.

54:21.410 --> 54:23.679
I thought you said
there were bodies.

54:23.680 --> 54:25.180
What are you guys up to?

54:25.181 --> 54:26.682
Where be the game master?

54:26.683 --> 54:29.120
Where be our hordes
for glorious combat?

54:29.519 --> 54:31.920
Everyone else completed their
mission and camped out

54:31.921 --> 54:33.020
on the battlefield.

54:33.021 --> 54:34.489
Are you guys gonna camp

54:34.490 --> 54:36.927
- or just stay up all night?
- Right.

54:37.994 --> 54:40.729
I must fight the
evil at its source!

54:42.565 --> 54:43.666
Gunther!

54:46.335 --> 54:48.670
You guys are on another planet.

54:48.671 --> 54:50.872
You know drugs are
off-limit out here.

54:50.873 --> 54:53.542
How far's the battlefield?
Ronnie Kwok's gonna hear about this.

54:53.543 --> 54:54.743
How far!

54:54.744 --> 54:55.844
Take it easy.

54:55.845 --> 54:57.615
That way through the forest.

54:58.615 --> 54:59.715
I'm out.

54:59.716 --> 55:00.817
Great.

55:01.050 --> 55:03.684
Now can we get the hell out of here?
You kidding?

55:03.685 --> 55:04.954
We can't leave Gunther.

55:08.390 --> 55:09.491
No.

55:10.392 --> 55:11.493
Joe.

55:12.095 --> 55:13.865
Goddamn it, Joe!

55:22.138 --> 55:25.010
Hey, what is that?

55:28.645 --> 55:32.017
Are they... I think they're...

55:35.251 --> 55:37.154
...is that Eddie?

55:42.959 --> 55:45.196
Beth?

55:47.096 --> 55:48.197
Beth!

55:48.564 --> 55:50.667
Holy shit, that's your
psychotic girlfriend?

55:51.067 --> 55:52.737
Ex-girlfriend.

55:56.606 --> 55:58.843
This is so fucked up.

56:01.611 --> 56:02.779
Guys.

56:05.315 --> 56:06.718
Dude, what...

56:08.484 --> 56:10.086
Hey.

56:21.531 --> 56:22.797
I'll tell you what I see.

56:22.798 --> 56:24.099
Tell you what I see.

56:24.100 --> 56:25.201
- A warrior.
- Warrior.

56:25.601 --> 56:27.836
Who can't let go of his past.

56:27.837 --> 56:29.105
Oh shit.

56:30.640 --> 56:33.142
This has something to do with the
photo of me and Beth at Prom.

56:33.143 --> 56:34.375
What?

56:34.376 --> 56:36.945
Yeah, in the book, the
fucking eBay book, man.

56:36.946 --> 56:39.281
What... Get the fuck out, man.

56:39.282 --> 56:41.983
No, I had the photo with me
when you summoned this...

56:41.984 --> 56:44.087
whatever this is with the book.

56:44.620 --> 56:47.156
Eric, use the book to send that
bitch back wherever she came from!

56:47.157 --> 56:48.389
I don't know how?

56:48.390 --> 56:51.162
I just picked a page
at random earlier.

56:51.961 --> 56:53.995
Well then, just pick another...

56:53.996 --> 56:56.768
pick another page and
hurry the fuck up.

56:59.168 --> 57:00.401
Sing it.

57:00.402 --> 57:01.503
Sing it, wizard.

57:28.664 --> 57:29.898
That was for Hung!

57:29.899 --> 57:31.167
Take that, bitch!

57:31.367 --> 57:34.941
That was sung by
Eric the Enchanter.

57:37.874 --> 57:39.107
What?

57:39.108 --> 57:40.376
You just let her get away.

57:40.377 --> 57:41.477
Excuse me?

57:42.178 --> 57:43.948
She just went off into the woods
to die like a wounded animal.

57:44.514 --> 57:46.214
Gimme the book.

57:46.215 --> 57:47.316
- Fuck!
- God.

57:48.217 --> 57:50.018
This is the "Sigillum Aemeth."
Where did you get this book?

57:50.019 --> 57:51.253
Uh, why?

57:51.254 --> 57:52.522
Shut up, never mind.

57:56.559 --> 57:58.528
Did you read this page?

58:00.530 --> 58:01.798
Um.

58:03.599 --> 58:04.698
- Why?
- Did you read it?

58:04.699 --> 58:06.469
Yes, yes... Holy fuck, yes.

58:07.136 --> 58:10.472
We read it and it scared that
crazy chick back to hell

58:10.473 --> 58:12.240
or wherever the fuck she came from.

58:12.241 --> 58:14.609
If that doesn't get me to level
27, I don't know what will

58:14.610 --> 58:15.877
Kwok, so why don't you pony up.

58:15.878 --> 58:17.479
No, no, no, no, no, okay.

58:17.480 --> 58:18.746
Now it makes sense.

58:18.747 --> 58:19.981
It makes no sense.

58:19.982 --> 58:21.249
It's gibberish...

58:21.250 --> 58:22.351
It makes sense!

58:22.652 --> 58:24.252
It makes sense that
you speak Enochian.

58:24.253 --> 58:25.521
Enochian, what?

58:26.122 --> 58:27.221
You made that up.

58:27.222 --> 58:30.425
This is the "Sigillum Aemeth."
It is the only one of its kind.

58:30.426 --> 58:33.463
It was handwritten in the 16th
Century by the mystic John Dee

58:33.464 --> 58:35.664
and it has been lost
for generations.

58:35.665 --> 58:36.765
Uh, bullshit.

58:36.766 --> 58:39.501
It came from the internets,
not the 16th Century.

58:39.502 --> 58:42.270
If you're tying to get out of
admitting how awesome I am...

58:42.271 --> 58:45.640
John Dee was tying to summon
angels, but evil travels under

58:45.641 --> 58:48.176
its own power and he
actually summoned demons

58:48.177 --> 58:50.280
and the demons forged this book.

58:50.813 --> 58:52.347
What are you saying, Kwok?

58:52.348 --> 58:54.786
Dee tried to destroy,
but he couldn't.

58:54.984 --> 58:58.086
So he sealed it and he hid it
deep underneath his manor estate

58:58.087 --> 59:00.255
and it has been lost
for generations.

59:00.256 --> 59:06.195
But here it is in your incapable hands
and you summoned a succubus from hell!

59:20.810 --> 59:23.948
And then this last passage that
you read, the herald of Abominog.

59:24.814 --> 59:28.884
And in the language lay the
name of the hell lord Abominog

59:28.885 --> 59:32.659
and I hath spoken the name
and hell hath raineth down.

59:39.829 --> 59:42.266
You didn't injure it,
you ignorant fuck!

59:43.032 --> 59:44.735
You transformed it!

59:49.205 --> 59:50.306
Sorry.

59:51.508 --> 59:55.010
Transformed into what exactly?

01:00:08.925 --> 01:00:10.026
What?

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.827
What the fuck was that?

01:00:12.828 --> 01:00:13.929
I don't know.

01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:17.634
Ronnie Kwok's dragon!

01:00:18.569 --> 01:00:20.171
- Fuck... Fuck!
- Shit... Shit!

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:22.704
Oh my God, we overslept again.

01:00:22.705 --> 01:00:23.939
It's time for Evermore.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.401
- Come on.
- Grab the fucking horn.

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:28.076
The thing eats souls, you guys.

01:00:28.077 --> 01:00:29.512
We are gonna die.

01:00:31.515 --> 01:00:32.747
Shit!

01:00:32.748 --> 01:00:33.849
- Shit.
- What?

01:00:34.283 --> 01:00:36.053
It's the horn of war.

01:00:36.118 --> 01:00:38.856
It means that the battle of
Evermore is going to start

01:00:38.888 --> 01:00:39.955
in 10 minutes.

01:00:39.956 --> 01:00:42.390
Why now... It's like three
in the fucking morning.

01:00:42.391 --> 01:00:43.858
It's not supposed to happen
for another few hours,

01:00:43.859 --> 01:00:45.760
but Ira is a dick and did it early.

01:00:45.761 --> 01:00:47.896
There's a LARPer
buffet on that field

01:00:47.897 --> 01:00:51.470
and all those poor bastards
have are foam sticks.

01:00:55.404 --> 01:00:56.905
We have to save them.

01:00:56.906 --> 01:00:58.306
Are you fucking nuts?

01:00:58.307 --> 01:00:59.408
No.

01:01:01.811 --> 01:01:04.382
I think I've done
enough damage already.

01:01:05.247 --> 01:01:06.717
You... that thing...

01:01:08.485 --> 01:01:09.586
That's real!

01:01:10.487 --> 01:01:13.693
That thing slaughtered
our best friend.

01:01:16.627 --> 01:01:18.396
You gonna let that stand?

01:01:20.796 --> 01:01:23.331
You been out here
practicing this shit

01:01:23.332 --> 01:01:25.202
every weekend for years.

01:01:26.603 --> 01:01:27.704
Face it, man.

01:01:28.104 --> 01:01:31.243
You've got everything
but you earned nothing.

01:01:34.777 --> 01:01:36.580
Are you gonna hide from that then?

01:01:36.581 --> 01:01:39.017
The way you hide from real life?

01:01:40.316 --> 01:01:43.486
Or are you gonna man up

01:01:43.487 --> 01:01:46.960
and avenge the death of our friend?

01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:08.213
The time has come to
earn our valor, people.

01:02:31.367 --> 01:02:33.137
For Hung.

01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:55.524
Steel thyselves, adventurers.

01:02:55.525 --> 01:02:57.628
The time for battle is nigh.

01:02:57.993 --> 01:02:59.894
The fate of the glorious
kingdom of Evermore

01:02:59.895 --> 01:03:01.330
rests in the balance.

01:03:02.566 --> 01:03:06.000
Two armies fighting for one prize...
bragging rights

01:03:06.001 --> 01:03:08.438
on the Evermore LARP
Alliance message board.

01:03:09.673 --> 01:03:10.774
Diamond starts speech.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.876
He rouseth the troops.

01:03:13.943 --> 01:03:16.211
I am well aware...

01:03:16.212 --> 01:03:20.381
that words cannot
inspire courage...

01:03:20.382 --> 01:03:24.219
render a timid army valiant.

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.757
And perhaps words are
unnecessary for you,

01:03:27.758 --> 01:03:32.561
my brave lot, for there is
no timidity within you.

01:03:32.562 --> 01:03:33.629
Oh, wow.

01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:35.130
You know, I worked
with him last year.

01:03:35.131 --> 01:03:36.699
He's got such a gift
for the theatrics.

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:37.932
Yes, he loves it.

01:03:37.933 --> 01:03:40.135
- Oh, here goes Carey.
- Here goes.

01:03:40.136 --> 01:03:43.371
Some of you are gentle
souls in peace,

01:03:43.372 --> 01:03:45.874
but when that horn of battle blows,

01:03:45.875 --> 01:03:48.580
we must disguise our fair nature...

01:03:49.044 --> 01:03:51.813
Summon up our blood!

01:03:53.315 --> 01:03:56.384
Draw up our most terrible aspect!

01:03:58.287 --> 01:04:00.421
- Unleash our rage!
- Ahhh... Mother...

01:04:00.422 --> 01:04:03.391
Fortune is on our side,

01:04:03.392 --> 01:04:06.394
but if that fickle bitch
should prove unjust...

01:04:07.464 --> 01:04:10.633
Then go down fighting like gods

01:04:10.634 --> 01:04:13.769
and leave your enemies a bloody

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:15.970
and mournful victory

01:04:15.971 --> 01:04:19.240
that tastes like ashes
in their mouths.

01:04:19.241 --> 01:04:22.511
I covet only one thing.

01:04:22.512 --> 01:04:24.780
Honor and victory!

01:04:27.082 --> 01:04:29.117
Wait... Verily, that is two things.

01:04:30.419 --> 01:04:33.592
Join me in coveting
those same glories.

01:04:34.123 --> 01:04:36.191
For if it be a sin,

01:04:36.192 --> 01:04:42.498
let us be the most
offending soul... souls alive!

01:04:44.668 --> 01:04:48.203
They shall curse themselves
for not being here,

01:04:48.204 --> 01:04:51.507
for not being able to
say they fought with us

01:04:51.508 --> 01:04:55.716
upon the fields of Evermore!

01:05:05.555 --> 01:05:07.656
Warriors are reminded
to remain honorable

01:05:07.657 --> 01:05:09.190
in their combat.

01:05:09.191 --> 01:05:10.961
No strikes to the codpiece.

01:05:11.494 --> 01:05:13.629
Kwok's gonna be so
pissed he missed this.

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:14.896
No shit.

01:05:18.735 --> 01:05:19.836
The horn bloweth.

01:05:20.704 --> 01:05:23.609
The battle of Evermore has begun!

01:05:26.342 --> 01:05:27.676
What the hell is that?

01:05:27.677 --> 01:05:30.782
I kind... I lost the
official horn of battle.

01:05:31.046 --> 01:05:34.786
This is the shofar
from my temple, so...

01:05:41.691 --> 01:05:43.493
Evermore.

01:05:54.738 --> 01:05:55.871
Charge!

01:05:57.072 --> 01:05:58.173
Charge!

01:06:00.009 --> 01:06:01.744
The battle is upon us.

01:06:01.745 --> 01:06:04.884
Which army shall reap the
spoils of the conquest?

01:06:18.461 --> 01:06:20.629
King Diamond's army
doth fight with valor

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:24.069
and opening a can of yon
whoop-ass upon their foes.

01:06:42.117 --> 01:06:44.252
The king's army is
holding their ground,

01:06:44.253 --> 01:06:46.789
matching them hit
point for hit point.

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:47.957
Calling Ronnie's dragon.

01:06:47.958 --> 01:06:50.061
Get the hell out here already.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.930
A dragon hath appeared.

01:06:52.995 --> 01:06:55.430
A bounty of experience
points await the brave souls

01:06:55.431 --> 01:06:57.833
who dare take on this
ferocious beast.

01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:02.771
And please, don't be
douchelords with the wings.

01:07:02.772 --> 01:07:05.076
The papier mâché is still dying.

01:07:09.111 --> 01:07:10.379
This is the best!

01:07:16.586 --> 01:07:17.854
What was that?

01:07:20.457 --> 01:07:21.924
Those fuckers didn't wait for me!

01:07:21.925 --> 01:07:23.926
It took us two weeks
to build that thing.

01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:28.898
What was that?

01:07:31.433 --> 01:07:33.036
Get points, you get points.

01:07:36.338 --> 01:07:38.275
Run, puny humans!

01:07:44.213 --> 01:07:45.312
That's perfect, that's perfect.

01:07:45.313 --> 01:07:46.615
- Oh, let's get them.
- Hit this one.

01:07:46.616 --> 01:07:50.051
Yeah.

01:07:54.123 --> 01:07:55.189
Motherfuckers.

01:08:03.332 --> 01:08:04.433
Yeah!

01:08:05.735 --> 01:08:07.002
Oh yeah.

01:08:07.003 --> 01:08:08.570
I got the crip.

01:08:10.006 --> 01:08:12.510
We're back, bitches... ha!

01:08:14.343 --> 01:08:15.979
These people are not
part of the game.

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.082
Repeat, not part of the game!

01:08:18.413 --> 01:08:19.814
I'm so outta here.

01:08:19.816 --> 01:08:22.551
Guild... Stand and fight
those red of neck!

01:08:22.551 --> 01:08:25.020
Together, attack!

01:08:29.759 --> 01:08:31.027
Triangulate!

01:08:35.999 --> 01:08:37.933
Not so fast, Meals on Wheels.

01:09:32.386 --> 01:09:33.522
Oh God!

01:09:37.225 --> 01:09:38.292
Did it see us?

01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:39.393
I don't know.

01:09:41.162 --> 01:09:42.733
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:09:45.001 --> 01:09:46.635
- What's going on?
- What the hell?

01:09:46.636 --> 01:09:48.738
Holy shit, what is that?

01:09:53.242 --> 01:09:54.308
Fuck, fuck!

01:09:54.309 --> 01:09:56.578
Holy shit!

01:09:56.579 --> 01:09:58.014
- What the fuck!
- Shit!

01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:02.419
Oh shit!

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:10.025
It's some sort of giant monster.

01:10:10.026 --> 01:10:11.927
Looks maybe like a Batsu.

01:10:11.928 --> 01:10:13.162
I don't know.

01:10:13.163 --> 01:10:14.428
Maybe an Otyugh.

01:10:14.429 --> 01:10:16.330
Or a Mind Flayer it
could be a rage Gollum.

01:10:16.331 --> 01:10:18.834
Look, it's got the deadly tentacles,
just like the monster manual.

01:10:18.835 --> 01:10:21.170
Shit, how is this even possible?
I don't know.

01:10:26.876 --> 01:10:28.579
Fuck this.

01:10:31.881 --> 01:10:32.982
Fuckin' toy.

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:41.857
Fuck!

01:10:44.561 --> 01:10:45.827
Fuck!

01:10:45.828 --> 01:10:47.162
Okay.

01:10:47.163 --> 01:10:49.131
Hold on... All right, I got a plan.

01:10:49.132 --> 01:10:52.034
On the count of three, we're gonna
make a break for the path, all right?

01:10:52.035 --> 01:10:53.504
One... hey, focus!

01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:55.740
- Two.
- No, fuck this shit!

01:10:56.472 --> 01:11:00.374
I am not moving another step until
somebody tells me what the hell...

01:11:01.878 --> 01:11:04.213
There's something really
terrible coming, you guys,

01:11:04.214 --> 01:11:07.621
and we're here to save... Oh shit.

01:11:11.988 --> 01:11:13.825
Oh... sh....

01:11:24.601 --> 01:11:27.706
Gwen, if the world isn't
swallowed up into hell...

01:11:30.073 --> 01:11:33.379
You wanna go see a show sometime?

01:11:36.012 --> 01:11:37.715
Nice timing, warrior.

01:11:40.883 --> 01:11:41.984
Sure.

01:11:43.418 --> 01:11:44.886
Yeah... Yeah, sure.

01:11:44.887 --> 01:11:46.456
A show would be good.

01:11:48.224 --> 01:11:49.691
No, demon!

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.397
You shall not harm
this quivering boy!

01:11:56.933 --> 01:11:58.200
Hey!

01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:02.239
- Thank you, mighty warrior!
- Yeah.

01:12:04.439 --> 01:12:07.879
Hath though be Enochian?

01:12:22.458 --> 01:12:25.195
Give us a smile, sweet cheeks.

01:12:29.932 --> 01:12:31.166
Oh yes!

01:12:31.167 --> 01:12:32.268
Yes!

01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:35.904
Fuck.

01:12:35.905 --> 01:12:37.773
God, what is that?

01:12:37.774 --> 01:12:39.543
Ahhh... What is that sound?

01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:43.113
She's laughing at us.

01:12:43.479 --> 01:12:45.381
Enough, you bitch!

01:12:46.182 --> 01:12:47.283
Fuck.

01:12:48.751 --> 01:12:51.019
Gotta find it, fuck.

01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:52.487
Ronnie, wh-what are you doing?

01:12:52.488 --> 01:12:53.754
I drive a hybrid, Eric.

01:12:53.755 --> 01:12:55.190
There's no on button in this thing.

01:12:55.191 --> 01:12:57.492
You can speak Enochian
but can't drive a truck?

01:12:57.493 --> 01:12:58.827
It's not my fault.

01:12:58.828 --> 01:13:00.829
Ronnie, I can't find the
spell, where is it?

01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:02.098
It's in the back of the book!

01:13:02.099 --> 01:13:03.465
I marked it clearly!

01:13:03.466 --> 01:13:05.000
It is in the back!

01:13:05.001 --> 01:13:06.868
Fuckin' find it, find it, fuck.

01:13:06.869 --> 01:13:08.537
Oh, hey, I got this going, guys.

01:13:23.353 --> 01:13:25.654
This shall not hold
the beast for long!

01:13:29.158 --> 01:13:31.793
I got it, I got it, I got it!

01:13:48.544 --> 01:13:49.811
The gem!

01:13:49.812 --> 01:13:50.913
The gem!

01:13:59.655 --> 01:14:01.625
Choke on it.

01:14:04.927 --> 01:14:06.295
No, watch out!

01:14:16.606 --> 01:14:18.876
No!

01:14:19.409 --> 01:14:22.782
I'm on fire!

01:14:25.047 --> 01:14:27.852
I'm on fire!

01:14:31.287 --> 01:14:32.921
Gwen, I need you!

01:14:39.862 --> 01:14:41.096
You okay?

01:14:41.097 --> 01:14:42.764
Why the fuck would you do that?

01:14:42.765 --> 01:14:44.866
I'm gonna stop saving your lives

01:14:44.867 --> 01:14:47.302
if you don't show me
some fucking gratitude!

01:14:47.303 --> 01:14:48.770
Okay, okay, focus!

01:14:48.771 --> 01:14:50.831
Where is the book that you
were just reading from?

01:14:50.907 --> 01:14:52.407
- We need the book.
- Fuck off.

01:14:52.408 --> 01:14:53.608
- Well... Shit!
- No.

01:14:53.609 --> 01:14:54.708
No, that's okay... This is good.

01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:56.411
This is the gem we were...
Okay this is...

01:14:56.412 --> 01:14:58.246
When he read the "Sigillum",
the gem glowed,

01:14:58.247 --> 01:14:59.781
so that is the source of the power.

01:14:59.782 --> 01:15:01.550
So the book is like an
instruction manual?

01:15:01.551 --> 01:15:02.751
Yes!

01:15:02.752 --> 01:15:05.189
But it's more like
a recipe booklet.

01:15:05.555 --> 01:15:06.955
What does thou need?

01:15:06.956 --> 01:15:10.058
I need a banishment spell
but the book is ruined,

01:15:10.059 --> 01:15:11.293
so we don't have one!

01:15:11.294 --> 01:15:12.761
I'll get your book.

01:15:12.762 --> 01:15:14.999
Guys, whatever you're
doing, do it faster!

01:15:16.432 --> 01:15:17.933
Was it like a thing, like, uh...

01:15:17.934 --> 01:15:20.401
I don't know, I can't remember!
There was a note key.

01:15:20.402 --> 01:15:21.570
There was like a...

01:15:22.839 --> 01:15:24.408
Game master!

01:15:25.908 --> 01:15:27.678
Here be your spell!

01:15:30.079 --> 01:15:32.482
Oh my God, fucking gambit!

01:15:32.483 --> 01:15:33.918
It's a dead head!

01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:35.317
What does it say?

01:15:35.318 --> 01:15:36.952
It's hot and it's so awful.

01:15:36.953 --> 01:15:38.186
I can't...

01:15:38.187 --> 01:15:39.455
Calm down now.

01:15:39.456 --> 01:15:40.557
Calm down!

01:15:44.794 --> 01:15:46.462
Oh.

01:15:46.463 --> 01:15:48.464
No, no, no, no, no.

01:15:48.465 --> 01:15:49.531
Crap!

01:15:57.106 --> 01:15:59.109
Ronnie!

01:16:01.777 --> 01:16:03.780
It's up to you, Jobryeth.

01:16:18.361 --> 01:16:19.494
Eric... Eric!

01:16:19.495 --> 01:16:21.029
The gem combined with
signing, that's what makes

01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:22.864
- the magic work, right?
- Fuck if I know, man.

01:16:22.865 --> 01:16:25.367
Are you a wizard or not?
Yes, yes, yes.

01:16:25.368 --> 01:16:26.804
It's definitely the catalyst.

01:16:27.370 --> 01:16:28.703
I think this song will work...
Fire it up.

01:16:28.704 --> 01:16:29.971
Track two.

01:16:29.972 --> 01:16:31.240
Go.

Sabbath?

01:17:03.507 --> 01:17:04.574
Is it Motorhead?

01:17:04.575 --> 01:17:07.012
