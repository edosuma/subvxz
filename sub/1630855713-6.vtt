00:06.006 --> 00:08.258
-[Mel] Ava! Ava!
-[baby crying]

00:08.341 --> 00:10.218
-[fire alarm ringing]
-Ava!

00:10.301 --> 00:12.762
-[crying continues]
-Chloe?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.431
[crying continues]

00:14.514 --> 00:15.348
Chloe!

00:18.351 --> 00:19.978
Oh, sweetheart.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.856
-It's okay. It's okay. Okay. Okay.
-[crying continues]

00:22.939 --> 00:23.982
Ava!

00:24.649 --> 00:26.526
Ava! Oh my God.

00:26.609 --> 00:27.610
Oh my God. Ava.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.196
Ava, wake up! Ava, wake up!

00:30.280 --> 00:31.990
Wake up! Wake up!

00:32.073 --> 00:34.159
-[monitor beeping rapidly]
-Come on, Jay, come on.

00:34.242 --> 00:36.494
He could've damaged his liver
or his spleen in the fall,

00:36.578 --> 00:37.912
but I don't know.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.582
Yeah, I'm not feeling
any excessive internal bleeding.

00:40.665 --> 00:43.043
-His abdomen is still soft.
-Punctured his lung?

00:44.627 --> 00:46.880
Oh, yeah.
Yes, there is tracheal deviation.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.631
-Pneumothorax.
-Yep!

00:48.715 --> 00:49.966
Muriel!

00:50.633 --> 00:52.719
Take over for Cameron
on the bag valve mask.

00:52.802 --> 00:56.890
And keep squeezing steady
every six to eight seconds.

00:56.973 --> 00:57.849
I'm in.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.689
-What is that for?
-Needle decompression.

01:04.773 --> 01:08.068
Need to let the air out of the space
between the lung and the chest wall

01:08.151 --> 01:09.486
so that the lung can re-inflate.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.447
[rapid beeping continues]

01:14.449 --> 01:16.534
Isn't that a little close to the sternum?

01:17.368 --> 01:18.369
[Doc clears throat]

01:22.957 --> 01:23.792
Uh…

01:24.292 --> 01:25.960
I… I want you to do this.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.756
-Second intercostal space midclavicular.
-Yup.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.674
[Doc] Yeah.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.054
[beeping normalizes]

01:37.388 --> 01:40.225
[grave music playing]

01:41.309 --> 01:42.477
[Lizzie] We have to get out.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.731
-[pleadingly] We gotta get out of here.
-No. No, no, no.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.608
It's getting too hot in here.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.945
Denny, we gotta get out
and make a run for it.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.530
Denny!

01:54.155 --> 01:55.907
[dramatic music playing]

01:57.117 --> 01:58.827
[car honking]

02:01.371 --> 02:02.330
Bert!

02:12.799 --> 02:14.551
Go! Get on out of here!

02:16.636 --> 02:17.637
Drive, Denny!

02:18.429 --> 02:20.431
[dramatic music building]

02:23.101 --> 02:25.103
[tense music playing]

02:36.739 --> 02:37.574
Mel!

02:44.372 --> 02:47.375
-[tense music continues]
-[sirens wailing faintly]

02:49.627 --> 02:50.920
[Mel] Ava, wake up!

02:51.004 --> 02:52.088
-Wake up!
-[Ava coughs]

02:52.172 --> 02:54.507
-[Jack] Mel!
-Jack? Jack!

02:54.591 --> 02:56.885
-Oh my God, Jack! Jack?
-[Chloe crying]

02:56.968 --> 02:58.720
-[wood groans]
-[Mel yelps]

03:00.638 --> 03:01.472
Go around!

03:01.556 --> 03:03.933
[Mel] Ava's stuck in Chloe's bedroom.
I can't get her up!

03:04.017 --> 03:06.102
I got her!
Just get out through the kitchen! Go!

03:06.186 --> 03:07.187
[Mel] Okay.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.314
-[Mel coughing]
-[Chloe crying]

03:12.609 --> 03:14.903
[crying continues]

03:17.447 --> 03:20.325
-Ava! Ava, let's get you out of here!
-[coughing]

03:20.408 --> 03:23.620
Give me your hands.
You ready? On three. One, two, three! Up!

03:23.703 --> 03:24.704
Okay. Here we go.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.123
-[Ava coughing]
-Here we go. Here we go.

03:28.708 --> 03:33.379
It's okay. It's okay. You're okay.
It's okay, baby, it's okay. It's okay.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.505
[screams] Jack!

03:35.673 --> 03:36.674
Jack!

03:36.758 --> 03:38.927
-[Chloe crying]
-It's okay.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.597
[Jack] It's all right. Okay.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.350
I got you. I got you.
Come on. We're out. I got you.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.645
-[Ava hoarsely] Chloe!
-I have her! I have her! She's right here.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.772
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

03:50.855 --> 03:53.816
-I'm sorry, I fell. I must've hit my head.
-[Chloe gasping raggedly]

03:53.900 --> 03:55.485
Why is she making that noise?

03:55.568 --> 03:57.487
She inhaled smoke.
We need to go to the clinic.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.280
-Let's get in the truck.
-[horse neighing]

03:59.364 --> 04:01.532
-The barn! I can't leave the animals!
-No! I got 'em!

04:01.616 --> 04:03.743
-You go with Mel! I'll meet you there!
-[Ava] Chloe.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.246
-[Mel] Be careful!
-[Chloe crying]

04:06.329 --> 04:07.872
-[Ava coughing]
-[Mel] I know, baby.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.584
We need to get him to a hospital.
Could be a hole in his lung leaking air.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.294
We won't know unless he arrests again.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.797
Two grams of cefazolin and, uh… I'll, uh…

04:15.880 --> 04:18.299
I'll try and get
a medevac team up here to…

04:18.383 --> 04:19.509
transport him out.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.802
Um…

04:20.885 --> 04:23.346
-Good job.
-[monitor beeping regularly]

04:29.018 --> 04:30.144
What just happened?

04:30.895 --> 04:32.772
All right, now give that to me again.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.941
[Hope] What was I thinking?

04:35.024 --> 04:38.695
They're just kids and I let them
drive out into the middle of a wildfire?

04:38.778 --> 04:42.490
Hope, I'm anxious enough as it is
without you making it worse.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.911
Lizzie and Denny have been gone too long.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.914
I know Nick said it's too dangerous
to send someone to look for them--

04:49.998 --> 04:52.875
-[Preacher] Hope, it's okay.
-What do you mean, "It's okay"?

04:52.959 --> 04:54.544
It's the furthest thing from okay.

04:54.627 --> 04:55.712
Turn around.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.717
Oh, thank God.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.636
I was worried sick about you two.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.848
The road was blocked,
and the fire was moving so fast.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.435
I'm just happy you two are safe.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.604
-Well, thanks to Bert, we are.
-[Hope exclaims] Oh, Bert!

05:13.688 --> 05:16.691
I'm just glad I was in my blue truck.
[laughs] She's a beast.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.072
[Lydie] Let's, uh,
get you something to eat.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.574
[exhales]

05:26.451 --> 05:29.996
Sounds like you saved as many lives
as the fire department today, Mrs. McCrea.

05:30.079 --> 05:30.913
Maybe more.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.081
Just doing my job.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.499
Well, my former job.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.376
His job. [clears throat]

05:35.460 --> 05:36.669
Thank you.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.759
How about we just try to get through
this thing together like a team?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.511
And don't go behind my back again.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.555
I'll be the Mutt to your Jeff.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.683
-Nick and Hope work fine.
-Yeah.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.896
Hey, things are getting crazy out there,

05:54.979 --> 05:57.231
so I brought a few of them here,
I hope that's okay.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.524
Yeah, sure.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.609
Where's Jack?

05:59.692 --> 06:00.902
He's not back yet?

06:03.279 --> 06:07.116
Making it extremely difficult
for firefighters to contain the blaze,

06:07.200 --> 06:10.078
flames tore through
the South Hills area earlier today

06:10.161 --> 06:13.581
destroying homes and burning
more than 1,000 hectares of land.

06:13.664 --> 06:16.000
-Back to--
-[Brie] Mike, anything?

06:16.084 --> 06:19.045
My buddy at Humboldt County
says the cell towers are down.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.797
Most landlines too.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.091
Dispatch put me
on the notification list for updates.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.842
[Amelia] There must be
a way to reach Jack.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.677
Maybe we should get in the car
and go there.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.304
And do what, Mom?

06:28.388 --> 06:31.766
The roads into Virgin River
are all closed, Mrs. Sheridan.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.851
They're just letting evacuees out.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.771
Let's just stay positive.
Maybe Mel and Jack made it out.

06:36.854 --> 06:39.440
Then why haven't we heard from them
or your boyfriend, Brady?

06:39.524 --> 06:41.776
-You must be worried sick about him.
-Mom, can we just--

06:41.859 --> 06:43.778
If he was here supporting you
like he should've--

06:43.861 --> 06:45.113
Mom, stop!

06:46.823 --> 06:49.283
I'm sure Brady would be here if he could.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.872
I'll be getting updates faster
than the news outlets.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.625
I can stay a while,
we can wait this out together.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.585
That would be wonderful. Thank you, Mike.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.881
Is anybody hungry? I could order us lunch.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.341
Let me find some menus.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.009
Thanks.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.679
-[somber music playing]
-[Brie] Um…

07:09.762 --> 07:12.390
Mike, you don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.267
You can go back to the hotel, or…

07:14.350 --> 07:15.351
I want to stay.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.648
[sirens wailing faintly]

07:25.778 --> 07:27.071
[Doc] How's he doing?

07:27.155 --> 07:30.408
He's stable for now.
He's gonna be out for the next few hours.

07:30.491 --> 07:34.454
Oh, good. Well, we're on a list
for the next available medevac team.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.374
But it may take a while.
Grace Valley is overwhelmed.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.712
What happened in there?

07:45.047 --> 07:47.717
I have been diagnosed
with macular degeneration.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.720
-I have been receiving treatment.
-Wait, how long have you known?

07:51.304 --> 07:52.472
Three months.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.265
And I'm finding out like this?

07:54.348 --> 07:55.641
I intended on telling you.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.603
What would've happened
to that firefighter if I didn't step in?

07:58.686 --> 08:01.105
It has never affected my work.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.274
How could you put him in that situation?

08:03.357 --> 08:05.860
-Do not question my integrity! Do not--
-[knock on door]

08:05.943 --> 08:08.529
I'm sorry. I need all hands on deck.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.615
[tense music playing]

08:14.869 --> 08:16.287
[Chloe coughing]

08:16.787 --> 08:18.498
[Mel] Chloe's airways are swollen.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.666
Lilly's house caught on fire,
they were trapped inside.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.169
Put her in my office.
Jay is still in the exam room.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.296
-[Cameron] Muriel, get the bassinet.
-[Muriel] Yeah.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.881
I don't know how long they were inside.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.799
We need to check them
for cyanide poisoning.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.718
-Can you get the pulse ox?
-[Cameron] I'm on it.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.638
I should've got her out of there earlier.
This is my fault.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.306
[Mel] Sweetheart, it's not your fault.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.183
We're gonna take good care of Chloe, Ava.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.268
And I just want to make sure
that you're okay.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.188
Muriel, can you set Ava up
in the room outside, please?

08:42.271 --> 08:44.065
[Muriel] Yeah. It's okay.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.733
It's okay. She's gonna be fine.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.861
[sighs] She said she hit her head.
I found her unconscious.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.113
Well, I can check
for a possible concussion.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.615
No! I will do it.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.701
Make sure the oxygen's flowing
and I'll be right back.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.786
[Chloe coughing]

08:58.246 --> 08:59.497
What is going on?

09:00.706 --> 09:02.708
[downbeat music playing]

09:02.792 --> 09:05.378
I couldn't… see.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.424
[Chloe coughing]

09:12.051 --> 09:13.302
Ava, just lay down.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.351
She's still really upset.

09:20.434 --> 09:23.062
Did you know
something was going on with Doc?

09:23.646 --> 09:24.647
Yes.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.650
And you didn't think I needed to know?

09:33.739 --> 09:37.660
[reporter on radio] Currently,
no containment, 52 structures destroyed.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.663
The fire has turned south,
progressing through South Hills.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.708
Multiple spot fires
reported in Coyote Canyon…

09:46.252 --> 09:47.420
Hey, what's up?

09:49.797 --> 09:50.798
Hi.

09:51.716 --> 09:55.219
Hey, look, you've…
hardly spoken to me since we got here.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.637
Are you okay?

09:56.721 --> 09:57.722
Yeah.

09:57.805 --> 09:58.806
It's just…

09:58.889 --> 10:01.100
It's a lot going on with the fire and all.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.561
[gentle music playing]

10:04.729 --> 10:07.023
Hey, um, in the car, I…

10:07.106 --> 10:09.191
I didn't mean to yell at you like that.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.277
I was just…

10:12.320 --> 10:14.822
-afraid that--
-I know. I'm not mad at you, Lizzie.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.244
I'm gonna…
I'm gonna go help with the chairs.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.704
Can't we talk about it?

10:22.580 --> 10:24.665
I can't. Yeah, I…

10:25.249 --> 10:26.417
-I just…
-What?

10:27.668 --> 10:28.669
Nothing.

10:29.211 --> 10:32.256
I just need a little space. That's all.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.469
[Preacher] Where the hell is Jack?

10:36.552 --> 10:38.179
He'll be here. Don't worry.

10:38.262 --> 10:42.058
Hey, Brady? I want to say
thank you for today.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.727
Not everyone'd
be willing to run into a fire.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.479
I'm just glad Hazel's okay.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.106
A couple people from the camp
said that you were in the military?

10:49.857 --> 10:52.860
Yeah, Preacher and I
served in the Marines.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.737
-That's why you're so brave.
-[laughs]

10:56.572 --> 10:58.574
Your friend saved my daughter's life.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.828
Well, I am glad that you
and your daughter are safe.

11:03.412 --> 11:07.958
[Nick] Uh, listen up, everyone.
Uh, Chief Smith has an update.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.380
This is obviously a fluid situation.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.675
The fire made its way quickly
through the South Hills area,

11:15.758 --> 11:19.178
and unfortunately,
we were not able to save the homes

11:19.261 --> 11:21.889
between Oxy Oak Drive and Fulton Highway.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.476
What about the homes in Coyote Canyon?
That's where a lot of us live.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.187
[Smith] Yeah, we're doing
everything we can to save those homes.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.314
I've been in touch with
the incident commander

11:30.398 --> 11:33.526
about getting some water planes
over to that area as soon as possible.

11:33.609 --> 11:36.779
But right now, there are more homes
that need protection

11:36.862 --> 11:38.614
than we have resources available.

11:38.698 --> 11:39.657
[man] We gonna be okay?

11:39.740 --> 11:42.576
I understand how you feel
and I give you my word

11:42.660 --> 11:46.038
I will do everything possible
to save your homes.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.500
Right now, I've gotta go over to the area
and assess the situation.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.919
But in the meantime, between the smoke

11:52.002 --> 11:54.922
and the communication being down
on both sides of the river,

11:55.005 --> 11:58.134
I suggest that you all just
hunker down here.

11:58.217 --> 12:02.471
If things take a turn, the safety
emergency zone is the field at Kid's Camp.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.473
But that's the worst-case scenario, folks.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.351
Now, I will be in touch with Nick
with any updates.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.230
Oh, one more thing
before you go, Chief Smith.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.399
The incident commander
you mentioned before.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.485
If I or Nick here
could talk to that person,

12:16.569 --> 12:19.155
we might be able to convince them
to send those water planes.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.198
Uh, give me your walkie.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.703
[walkie trills]

12:26.537 --> 12:27.997
[Smith] That's the IC's channel.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.875
He's hard to reach, but it couldn't hurt
to hear from the mayor.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.543
-All right, good luck.
-[Hope] Thank you.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.797
We are getting those planes, Nick.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.632
[woman] What do you mean,
"everything's gone"?

12:42.011 --> 12:44.013
Her oxygen level is still too low.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.807
I'll, uh…

12:46.891 --> 12:50.269
have Cameron check on her
after he finishes with Ava.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.812
No, I don't need Cameron.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.439
I have you.

12:53.522 --> 12:57.777
If what happened with Jay
happens again with Chloe, I…

12:57.860 --> 12:58.861
Doc…

12:59.570 --> 13:02.323
Doc, if it happens again,
we will deal with it.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.744
Look, I know that what happened
must have been disconcerting,

13:06.827 --> 13:09.371
but this town needs you right now.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.500
And if, God forbid,
Chloe takes a turn for the worse,

13:12.583 --> 13:16.670
there is nobody that I would
rather have standing by my side than you.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.548
[pensive music playing]

13:25.221 --> 13:30.100
All right, let's monitor her cyanosis
and signs of hypotension.

13:30.184 --> 13:33.020
And we have to be ready to intubate

13:33.103 --> 13:34.230
if needed.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.649
-Jack's here.
-[Mel] Oh.

13:36.732 --> 13:39.068
-[Doc] You go. I got Chloe.
-Thank you.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.573
-[Mel] Oh my God.
-[Jack sighs] It's all right.

13:47.034 --> 13:49.036
-[Mel] Let's go outside.
-Okay.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.665
[sirens wailing faintly]

13:53.165 --> 13:54.166
[Jack] Look, I, um…

13:55.751 --> 13:57.545
I got all the animals out, but…

13:58.379 --> 14:00.256
Lilly's house
and barn are completely gone.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.590
Oh no.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.051
Oh my God. Poor Tara.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.262
She must be freaking out
watching this on the news.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.557
Yeah, my mom and Brie too.
Haven't been able to get through to them.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.016
How are Chloe and Ava doing?

14:11.100 --> 14:15.104
We're monitoring Chloe,
and Ava's still pretty shook up. She's…

14:16.272 --> 14:18.274
When I got to the farm,
I couldn't find you,

14:18.357 --> 14:20.067
I was so worried about you and the baby.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.235
I know, I…

14:21.318 --> 14:23.237
[Jack] I'm just so glad you're okay.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.321
[Muriel] Mel?

14:25.197 --> 14:29.034
Chloe, she's pulling on her oxygen mask
and Doc's checking in on Jay.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.495
Okay, I'll be there in a second.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.038
No, no, go. Take care of Chloe.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.958
I better get to the bar.
Place is probably packed with evacuees.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.459
-You know where I'll be.
-Yeah.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.920
Just no more running
into burning houses. Okay?

14:40.004 --> 14:40.838
-Yes.
-Please?

14:40.921 --> 14:42.381
-I love you.
-I love you too.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.725
Their cell phones are still down, Mom.

14:53.976 --> 14:54.810
[Mike] Thanks.

14:57.021 --> 15:00.900
They're expanding the evacuation area
near Virgin River.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.443
[Amelia] Oh…

15:02.943 --> 15:05.613
I know how hard this is for you,
Mrs. Sheridan,

15:05.696 --> 15:09.366
but I've been in some of
the most difficult situations imaginable

15:09.450 --> 15:10.743
with your son.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.620
And he's always pulled through.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.205
Jack has always been
the strong one in the family.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.916
The one we could always lean on.

15:19.501 --> 15:24.089
You know, you're also sitting
next to an incredibly strong person.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.636
What your daughter did in court today
took a tremendous amount of strength.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.221
Yeah.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.432
[laughs]

15:33.515 --> 15:35.517
That's it? Just a "Yeah"?

15:35.601 --> 15:36.685
No other comment?

15:37.269 --> 15:38.437
Come on, Brie.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.648
-You know I think you're strong.
-Oh, do I?

15:40.731 --> 15:43.484
That's weird, because I don't think
I've ever heard you actually say it.

15:43.567 --> 15:46.070
I've heard you say
that Jack is the strong one. Um…

15:46.153 --> 15:48.989
Don is the funny one.
Mary's the saint. But what am I?

15:49.073 --> 15:52.201
-Brie, this is not the time--
-It's never the time. Is it, Mom?

15:52.284 --> 15:54.161
I'm seriously asking you, what am I?

15:54.244 --> 15:56.163
Right now,
I think you're a little selfish.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.623
Okay. [laughs]

16:02.127 --> 16:04.964
[Nick] I understand those planes
are deployed elsewhere.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.591
How soon can they be sent to Virgin River?

16:07.675 --> 16:10.135
You're doing great, Nick.
Let out your inner Churchill.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.345
-Shh.
-[static on radio]

16:11.428 --> 16:13.847
[man] We're doing everything we can
to get you those planes.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.600
I'll notify Chief Smith
as soon as they're available.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.186
What, that's it? We're screwed!

16:24.692 --> 16:27.945
People are real thankful out there.
Most of them haven't eaten all day.

16:30.447 --> 16:33.200
-What's your problem?
-I ain't got no problem.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.411
Clearly you do.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.454
You know, I don't know, I guess, uh…

16:37.538 --> 16:41.417
You know, I guess I'm just having trouble
with you acting like a war hero,

16:42.084 --> 16:43.377
despite who you saved today.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.712
Is that what I was doing?

16:46.130 --> 16:49.383
Unbelievable.
You just won't let it go, will you?

16:50.134 --> 16:50.968
Let it go?

16:51.927 --> 16:53.929
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, I'm serious.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.516
You hold on to what happened in Iraq.
Makes you feel like you're better than me.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.184
But guess what?

16:59.977 --> 17:00.978
You're not.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.232
You know, I've got a hundred people
out there who just lost their homes.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.776
Yeah, I know, Preacher.
I've been out there all day.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.487
-No, I do not have time for this!
-Hey, I need you guys outside. Now.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.574
-[tense music playing]
-[flames smoldering]

17:15.325 --> 17:16.618
Fire jumped the river.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.204
[dramatic music playing]

17:19.288 --> 17:21.665
-[people clamoring]
-[man] How is that possible?

17:29.298 --> 17:31.050
-[Mike] Hey.
-Hey.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.596
I'm sorry about that.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.389
It's all right.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.810
Relationships with moms can be… tricky.

17:41.894 --> 17:42.770
[Brie] Ugh.

17:43.353 --> 17:46.732
Why does what she thinks
still matter so much?

17:46.815 --> 17:48.233
I'm a grown woman.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.069
I just…

17:51.153 --> 17:54.073
I fall right back into old habits
when I'm around her.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.407
Because she's your mom.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.204
I always wanted my mom's approval too.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.290
Broke her heart when I told her
I wanted to be a cop

18:03.373 --> 18:05.084
after getting out of the military.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.835
She didn't talk to me for six months.

18:06.919 --> 18:07.753
[Brie] Oh.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.255
[chuckles] What did she want you to be?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.507
A dentist.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.593
Mmm, yeah, yeah.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.512
No, I can see that, though.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.723
Perfect smile, charming chairside manner.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.433
-Wow.
-Totally.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.019
I cannot catch a break with you, huh?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.438
[both chuckling]

18:26.522 --> 18:28.273
Well, for what it's worth,

18:28.982 --> 18:31.902
even though she didn't express it well,

18:32.778 --> 18:35.531
I think what your mom said
about you being strong,

18:36.115 --> 18:37.699
I think she really believes it.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.284
[Brie] Hmm.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.497
[phone chimes]

18:48.836 --> 18:51.338
-[amber alerts chiming]
-[Nick] Everybody, please just stay calm.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.589
Is the bar still safe?

18:52.673 --> 18:54.633
You said the fire
wouldn't cross the river.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.343
[people clamoring]

18:56.426 --> 18:58.804
[clamoring continues]

18:58.887 --> 19:01.557
-I don't know. I don't--
-[Hope] Simmer down.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.769
This is a mandatory evacuation notice
for all of Virgin River.

19:05.853 --> 19:10.440
So leave your belongings and make your way
down to the field at Kid's Camp

19:10.524 --> 19:12.067
in an orderly fashion.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.362
Like the fire chief said,
that is our designated safety zone.

19:15.445 --> 19:18.323
But the main thing is to stay calm.

19:18.407 --> 19:23.036
The B&B just caught fire.
Nick. Nick, we have to do something.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.830
-I gotta go.
-Nick!

19:24.913 --> 19:28.292
You can't do anything to save the B&B.
What you can do is help the people here.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.003
Because now they're panicked
and panic is contagious.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.504
You're right. You're right.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.924
Jo Ellen, Jo Ellen, look,
go down to the safety zone with Lydie.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.343
-And I'll meet you there, okay?
-Okay.

19:39.303 --> 19:43.849
Guys, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna…
Just breathe. It's gonna be okay.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.143
Thank you, Hope.

19:48.478 --> 19:51.815
[Brady] Gather the rest of the umbrellas!
Move everything wooden away from the bar!

19:51.899 --> 19:54.359
[Jack] Hey, Bert, give me a hand
with these tables, will you?

19:54.443 --> 19:56.361
Denny! I need you to get to the clinic!

19:56.445 --> 20:00.365
Make sure that Doc and Mel know
to evacuate! Get them to the safety zone!

20:00.949 --> 20:02.618
I'll see you down there.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.579
[Jack] Come on, guys, grab what you can!
The river bank's on fire!

20:06.997 --> 20:10.042
This is no longer about saving homes
on the other side of the river.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.002
This is about saving the entire town.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.712
Check on the status of the planes.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.839
They're not gonna get here in time, Hope.

20:15.923 --> 20:19.092
So unless you know somebody
with a plane, it ain't gonna happen.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.553
I do know someone with a plane.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.431
[tense music playing]

20:25.557 --> 20:27.768
[Jack] All right, let's go!
We're gonna dig a trench!

20:27.851 --> 20:28.936
[man] Come on! Over here!

20:29.019 --> 20:31.480
[Brady] Wind's picking up.
We need to start a backfire.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.607
-[Preacher] What are you talking about?
-A backfire.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.443
We clear the vegetation from
here to the water line. Burn what's left.

20:36.526 --> 20:39.112
Hell no! No one's lighting a fire
anywhere near the barn.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.822
-Fire's already here.
-I'm telling you--

20:40.906 --> 20:43.617
[Jack] Hey, Preach, hear him out!
He used to fight fires in prison!

20:43.700 --> 20:46.828
It'll turn the fire away from the bar.
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.081
Brady, that's just it. I don't trust you.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.166
-Come on, he may be right.
-You're siding with him?

20:51.250 --> 20:54.795
I'm not siding with anybody!
That is the enemy right there!

20:54.878 --> 20:58.173
All right, we gotta do something
or our bar is gonna burn to the ground!

20:59.675 --> 21:00.509
Do it!

21:01.051 --> 21:03.220
Bert, Tony, with me. Let's go. Come on!

21:03.303 --> 21:04.846
You better be right.

21:05.889 --> 21:06.890
[Hope] Jack?

21:08.058 --> 21:10.269
-Jack!
-Hope, what are you doing here?

21:10.352 --> 21:11.687
Get back to the safety zone!

21:11.770 --> 21:14.147
I just got off the radio with Chief Smith.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.734
I figured out a way to save Virgin River,
but I can't do it alone.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.736
Come on. Come on.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.495
Moving someone in Jay's condition
is incredibly risky.

21:28.578 --> 21:32.541
If he went into arrest again,
either on the move or in the safety zone,

21:32.624 --> 21:34.835
we would not have
what we need to keep him alive.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.712
-What's the alternative?
-[Denny] Grandpa!

21:38.505 --> 21:40.257
Have you heard? There's a mandatory--

21:40.340 --> 21:43.010
[Doc] Evacuation of Virgin River.
Yeah, we heard on the radio.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.636
Then why aren't you leaving?

21:44.720 --> 21:46.930
We have a patient who can't be moved.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.683
You can't all just stay here.
The fire's almost at the bar.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.184
You're right, Denny.

21:51.268 --> 21:55.564
We can't all stay here.
I am staying and everyone else is leaving.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.399
What? Doc, I can't--

21:57.482 --> 22:02.279
I am not taking a man
in critical condition into an empty field.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.823
I will wait here with him
until the medevac team arrives.

22:04.906 --> 22:07.743
-I'm staying too.
-No, I do not need you to.

22:07.826 --> 22:08.785
Yes, you do.

[sighs]

22:15.208 --> 22:16.209
Mel,

22:16.710 --> 22:18.587
get Chloe and Ava to safety.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.381
And Muriel and Denny
can help bring down what you need.

22:21.465 --> 22:25.510
Only if you two agree that if that fire
gets too close to the building…

22:25.594 --> 22:29.056
We will move Jay… as a last resort.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.894
All right. I'm gonna need
another portable oxygen tank,

22:33.977 --> 22:36.063
a blood pressure cuff and pulse oximeter.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.648
-[Muriel] On it.
-I'll help you gather the things.

22:42.903 --> 22:46.531
Look, I want you to know that I'm sorry
I did not tell you about Doc.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.950
It's just… It wasn't my place.

22:50.535 --> 22:54.373
I know. I shouldn't have
expected you to betray his trust.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.419
Don't be too hard on him.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.506
Doctors are heroes,
but they're also human.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.341
Same goes for you.

23:08.553 --> 23:12.140
Preacher has guys wetting down the bar.
I'll have him send people to come here.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.350
Thanks so much, Denny.

23:13.433 --> 23:16.228
Listen, I need you
to do another thing for me.

23:16.895 --> 23:20.357
Find Hope and… and make sure she's okay.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.777
And if anything happens to me, tell her…

23:24.945 --> 23:26.154
Tell her I love her.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.407
She means everything to me.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.118
And it's important that she hears that.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.620
Okay.

23:34.496 --> 23:35.705
Thank you, dear boy.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.664
[Charlie] You want to fly my plane
into the middle of a wildfire?

24:17.747 --> 24:20.083
Use her to drop water on the fire.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.586
Crop dusters are used
all the time to fight fires, Charlie.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.921
Yeah, I've heard of it.
I've never done it.

24:25.422 --> 24:28.258
-But she does have a 1,900-liter tank.
-[Hope] Great!

24:28.341 --> 24:30.719
Now all we have to do
is jump on your CB radio

24:30.802 --> 24:32.929
and get all your
other crop-dusting buddies--

24:33.013 --> 24:34.806
Whoa, whoa.
Just hold your horses there, Hope.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.933
I didn't agree to let you use my plane.

24:37.017 --> 24:40.395
Charlie, I've known you
as long as I've lived here.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.691
No one loves Virgin River
as much as me except you.

24:44.774 --> 24:47.110
That's why we've always got along so well.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.112
Not well enough, apparently.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.532
-[Jack] Hmm?
-I tried courting Hope between husbands.

24:52.616 --> 24:53.992
Got shot down every time.

24:54.075 --> 24:56.077
[Hope] And you're gonna
hold that against me now?

24:56.161 --> 24:58.997
With the entire town
about to go up in flames?

24:59.080 --> 25:01.708
I think what Hope
is trying to say, Charlie,

25:01.791 --> 25:05.086
is this is a day
that's gonna go down in history.

25:05.170 --> 25:09.007
The people of Virgin River are gonna be
talking about this fire for years to come.

25:09.591 --> 25:10.634
And we few…

25:12.302 --> 25:15.138
We happy few
will have made the difference.

25:15.222 --> 25:17.974
Now, this is your chance, Charlie,

25:18.058 --> 25:20.644
to have your name
be a part of every single story

25:20.727 --> 25:22.854
that they tell from this day forth.

25:23.605 --> 25:26.274
Oh, you're gonna be
remembered as a hero, Charlie.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.109
What do you say?

25:28.902 --> 25:29.861
You a pilot?

25:29.945 --> 25:31.655
I got a few hours under my belt.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.698
Well, I'm a licensed AG pilot.

25:33.782 --> 25:36.451
I've flown in rainstorms,
hailstorms, you name it.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.828
But with my bum leg…

25:40.121 --> 25:43.542
I'm gonna let you do the flying,
I'll do the navigating. How's that sound?

25:44.334 --> 25:47.504
-Let's save this town, Charlie.
-I'll grab the gear and night goggles.

25:47.587 --> 25:50.131
We can get your fire chief on the radio
once we're in the air.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.509
-[Jack] You got it!
-[Hope] Henry V, really?

25:52.592 --> 25:54.594
Well, I missed my calling. What can I say?

25:54.678 --> 25:57.973
You reach out to every farmer you know
while I fill her up with water,

25:58.056 --> 26:00.642
and then I want you to get back
into the safety zone, okay?

26:00.725 --> 26:03.478
-Okay! 10-4, good buddy.
-Okay.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.648
[indistinct chatter]

26:22.998 --> 26:24.124
I'm sorry.

26:26.793 --> 26:27.794
I was…

26:28.378 --> 26:31.715
humiliated by the way I reacted
when we were trapped in the car.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.053
I thought I'd come to terms with death.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.933
And in that moment, I realized
I hadn't prepared myself for dying at all.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.320
I'm in love with you, Lizzie.

26:55.071 --> 26:56.781
And I don't want to lose you.

26:57.365 --> 26:58.325
But…

26:58.825 --> 27:00.910
you deserve to know what kind of man I am.

27:01.911 --> 27:04.581
I know exactly
what kind of man you are, Denny.

Her vitals aren't where I want them, but…

she's a fighter.

Bump on my head's nothing
compared to the pit in my stomach.

I just can't believe that the farm's gone.

27:56.883 --> 27:57.884
[Mel] I know.

How am I gonna tell Tara?

28:02.389 --> 28:03.431
I don't know.

you and your men to pull back now.

What? No.
No, we're here for whatever you need.

I'm not asking you, Preacher.

the fire could jump the river,
