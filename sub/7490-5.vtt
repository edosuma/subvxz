WEBVTT

00:02.875 --> 00:05.709
Guys, huge problem-- Kelsey Vargas,

00:05.792 --> 00:08.500
the coolest girl in school,
is on her way down here.

00:08.583 --> 00:10.333
Don't panic. We've trained for this.

00:10.417 --> 00:13.041
- Guys, bust out the emergency deodorant.
- Yeah.

00:14.125 --> 00:15.542
I don't need deodorant.

00:15.625 --> 00:18.166
We all need deodorant. We're teenage boys.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.750
Our bodies are a smorgasbord of smells.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.875
I don't take any chances.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.583
I’m wearing a necklace
of air fresheners right now.

00:30.166 --> 00:32.458
This week I'm Alpine Meadow.

00:34.542 --> 00:36.458
I told Kelsey I was a martial arts expert

00:36.542 --> 00:38.125
and the youngest sensei in history.

00:38.208 --> 00:40.875
- Jerry.
- Oh, Rudy, Kelsey’s on her way.

00:40.959 --> 00:43.125
Dude, please hook me up
with that black belt.

00:43.208 --> 00:44.333
You can't have this belt.

00:44.375 --> 00:47.125
It's a symbol of hard work, honor
and respect.

00:47.208 --> 00:49.250
Well, then why do you
use it to walk your dog?

00:49.333 --> 00:51.625
That was one time and it was an emergency.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I had a pug with the squirts
and new white carpet.

00:54.834 --> 00:58.000
Look, can we stop talking
and get to sparring, please?

00:58.083 --> 00:59.583
Jerry, you're up against Kim.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.500
- Milton, you're with me.
- Eddie, you're with Jack.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.333
Jack?

01:06.750 --> 01:09.709
Uh, hold on. My phone's vibrating.

01:11.417 --> 01:14.583
You know, I hate to be that guy, but--
Hello?

01:14.667 --> 01:16.500
You mean the guy that pretends
his wallet is a phone?

01:16.583 --> 01:17.959
Please, shh!

01:19.041 --> 01:20.667
Can you hear me now?

01:20.750 --> 01:22.375
Come on, guys, let's go.

01:26.458 --> 01:27.583
Hi, Jerry.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.959
Kelsey, what a surprise.

01:31.041 --> 01:33.959
So these are your students
that fear and respect you?

01:34.083 --> 01:35.834
Yes, we are.

01:35.917 --> 01:38.959
I’m about to fear and respect
the living grits out of him right now.

01:39.041 --> 01:42.000
Oh, no, not my grits.
I'm gonna need my grits.

01:47.500 --> 01:50.917
Yeah, I’d say you've got
that move down pretty well.

01:51.792 --> 01:53.583
Oh, you guys take a five.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.709
Kelsey and I are gonna get a froyo.

01:55.792 --> 01:57.291
Oh, come on, Kelsey.

02:49.542 --> 02:51.542
Hey, thanks a lot, Kim.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.750
You cost me a date
with the coolest girl in school.

02:54.417 --> 02:57.542
What are you gonna do, sensei,
throw me out of the dojo?

02:59.208 --> 03:01.625
Kim, in the future,
Let's respect Jerry enough

03:01.709 --> 03:04.125
not to embarrass him
in front of girls he's lying to.

03:04.709 --> 03:07.542
Thank you, Jack. It's called decency, Kim.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.875
All hail Miltonius,

03:16.709 --> 03:20.625
the newly-crowned king of Narnia!

03:22.208 --> 03:23.208
See, Milton,

03:23.291 --> 03:27.166
This is the reason you had to go
to spring formal with the biolab skeleton.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.166
I’ll have you know that Bonita
is an excellent dancer.

03:31.458 --> 03:33.375
Hey, I know what's going on.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.417
It's that time of year
when all the dorks come out

03:35.500 --> 03:37.166
to play swords and magic in the park.

03:37.667 --> 03:40.583
Or if it rains, we use the bingo hall
at the senior center.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.709
We tear it up.

03:44.083 --> 03:46.750
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hey, Kelsey.

03:46.834 --> 03:49.208
I was just talking to this kid
I've never seen before.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.792
I don't even know his name. Right, Milton?

03:52.166 --> 03:53.417
Really, Jerry?

03:55.333 --> 03:56.834
Guys, big news,

03:56.917 --> 03:59.792
this year you all are gonna participate
in the battle with me.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.333
What happened to all your other friends?

04:01.417 --> 04:04.166
You know, the ones that throw up
when I try to talk to them?

04:04.834 --> 04:07.458
Well, this year things
are a little complicated.

04:07.542 --> 04:09.417
Francis has a bassoon recital,

04:09.500 --> 04:11.542
Jeffrey is a finalist in the Mathlympics

04:11.625 --> 04:14.458
and Louis got grounded
for teaching his cockatiel bad words.

04:15.166 --> 04:17.166
Dude, we're not gonna be
a part of your nerdfest.

04:17.917 --> 04:19.166
Very funny, Jerry.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.458
NerdFest is in Minneapolis in October.`

04:23.000 --> 04:25.333
See, Milton, a bunch of dudes in tights,

04:25.417 --> 04:27.542
running around the woods
beating each other senseless

04:27.625 --> 04:30.750
with foam swords--
It's just not our thing.

04:30.834 --> 04:32.250
Well, it's my thing

04:32.333 --> 04:34.709
and I wanna share this moment
with my best friends.

04:35.417 --> 04:38.792
- That's you guys.
- I don't know.

04:38.875 --> 04:42.000
I just quit the cello
and threw out my panda bear backpack.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.000
I’m just starting to get cool.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.500
Come on, just give it a chance.

04:47.542 --> 04:50.583
Soon you'll know the exhilaration
of bounding down a hill,

04:50.667 --> 04:54.709
cape aflutter, to slay a half-elf
with a foam rubber ax.

04:54.792 --> 04:58.750
Are you with me? All for one and one for--

04:59.667 --> 05:01.000
Gah!

05:01.709 --> 05:04.125
I probably lost 'em at "cape aflutter."

05:10.375 --> 05:12.417
I can't believe my own friends
bailed on me.

05:13.375 --> 05:16.083
I don't know-- Running around the woods,

05:16.166 --> 05:18.208
beating other dudes senseless
with foam swords--

05:19.125 --> 05:21.166
That just sounds like a good time to me.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.792
I even rented them costumes
and everything.

05:25.709 --> 05:27.583
You know what? I love stuff like this.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.542
Are you saying
you'll go into battle with me?

05:31.500 --> 05:34.667
It would be an honor, my lord.

05:36.333 --> 05:39.667
Wow, you may be the only
real friend I have.

05:42.417 --> 05:43.834
With this bo staff,

05:43.917 --> 05:48.417
I dub thee, Rudy, my faithful squire.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.041
I can't believe it. I'm a squire!

05:51.125 --> 05:52.834
I’m a squire! I'm a squire!

05:55.959 --> 05:57.250
<i>♪ Hey ♪</i>

05:57.333 --> 05:59.208

05:59.417 --> 06:01.625

06:01.709 --> 06:05.083
You know, I don't think
this squiring thing is for me.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.625
This turkey leg isn't gonna salt itself.

06:13.625 --> 06:16.333
Dang it, I left my grape juice
in the port-o-pooper.

06:18.041 --> 06:19.709
What are you waiting for? Go get it.

06:27.667 --> 06:30.333
It's so hard to find
good squires these days.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.625
Oh, guys, check it out.

06:41.709 --> 06:43.500
I smoothed everything out with Kelsey.

06:43.583 --> 06:47.750
I promised I would never lie to her again,
and I got a date with her this afternoon.

06:47.834 --> 06:51.375
- Yeah!
- The kid is back in the game. Whoo!

06:52.083 --> 06:53.500
Nerd alert.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.709
Greetings. We are the Dark Knights.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.583
Warriors known for being brave
and ferocious and--

07:00.667 --> 07:01.583
Ferocious?

07:01.667 --> 07:04.250
Sidney, you cried in science
when your fruit fly died.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.750
That fruit fly left behind 3,000 babies.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.834
Milton said he put together
a band of loyal warriors

07:12.917 --> 07:14.875
that will finally capture our grail
and defeat us.

07:14.959 --> 07:17.000
Like that's going to happen.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.875
Ha-ha-ha-haa. Haa-haa.

07:19.959 --> 07:21.917
- Dude, dude, dude.
-

07:22.917 --> 07:25.166
That evil laugh is so not working.

07:26.417 --> 07:27.333
Thanks, Benny.

07:27.417 --> 07:28.750
You told me it was intimidating.

07:33.917 --> 07:34.834
Whoa.

07:36.083 --> 07:39.542
Guys, Milton called us his loyal warriors.

07:40.291 --> 07:41.750
Now he's gonna be out there all alone

07:41.834 --> 07:44.417
against a flock of dweebs
hopped up on Honey Buns.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.375
Uh, Jack, are you saying we should go
to the park and help him?

07:48.125 --> 07:50.709
Because, uh, I-- I can't.

07:50.792 --> 07:52.875
My aunt Charlotte--

07:52.959 --> 07:55.959
Yeah, she's coming in from Charlotte

07:56.041 --> 07:59.166
and we're gonna go watch
"Charlotte's Web."

08:02.500 --> 08:04.250
Wow, I am not good at lying.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.875
Look, Milton’s always been there for us.

08:08.125 --> 08:11.041
Jerry, what about the time
where you tried to get Kelsey jealous

08:11.125 --> 08:13.208
by making her think
you were dating a cheerleader?

08:13.291 --> 08:14.583
Who helped you out?

08:26.625 --> 08:29.417
Wow, you're right. He was there for me

08:30.125 --> 08:32.625
Did you know that Brian Donnelly
actually asked him out?

08:34.083 --> 08:36.166
Eddie, what about you?

08:36.250 --> 08:38.250
You hate going to visit your nana.

08:38.375 --> 08:41.125
That's because she always wants
to do things to my hair.

08:42.166 --> 08:43.750
But who always goes with you?

08:50.625 --> 08:53.542
I love it. I'm gonna rock this new look.

08:59.417 --> 09:01.875
Sometimes I think
nana loves him more than me.

09:03.542 --> 09:04.792
And I’m okay with that.

09:06.583 --> 09:09.792
And, Kim, what about that time
at the St. Patrick's Day Concert

09:09.875 --> 09:11.041
when you lost your voice?

09:11.125 --> 09:12.250
Who got you through that?

09:14.583 --> 09:17.250
<i>♪ No more St. Patrick's day she'll keep ♪</i>

09:17.333 --> 09:19.333

09:21.834 --> 09:24.792

09:29.750 --> 09:32.291
Guys, I think you know what we have to do.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.291
Seriously?

09:41.375 --> 09:43.625
Is this really what we have to do?

09:43.709 --> 09:45.000
Yes, it is.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.875
Come on, let's go to the park.

09:53.959 --> 09:55.083
I don't get it.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.834
Why do I have to be the princess?

09:57.583 --> 09:59.041
I am not swapping.

10:05.625 --> 10:07.917
Hey, lady, eyes up here, okay?

10:09.250 --> 10:12.291
Oh, these sexy legs are a curse.

10:22.667 --> 10:23.959
I can't take this anymore.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.000
It's hot, my feet are killing me

10:27.083 --> 10:29.458
And these elf ears
are starting to get sweaty.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.667
You don't get to complain.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.625
We could have stayed
on the path to the battlefield,

10:36.709 --> 10:39.792
but no, you knew
a shortcut through the woods.

10:40.834 --> 10:42.750
This is not a shortcut, Eddie!

10:43.875 --> 10:45.166
Relax.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.875
I'm an Explorer Scout.

10:46.959 --> 10:49.375
I was trained to navigate by the stars.

10:49.458 --> 10:51.959
- Oh, I can help you see the stars.
- Hey, hey.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.375
Come on, guys, we have to focus.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.208
Milton's battle starts in a half-hour.

10:57.542 --> 11:00.583
Hey, it's a groundhog.

11:01.125 --> 11:02.291
Hey.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.125
Well, you're a cute little fella,
aren't you?

11:05.208 --> 11:08.000
- How are you doing? How are you doing?
-

11:08.083 --> 11:11.166
That's not a groundhog, Jerry.
That's a porcupine.

11:11.250 --> 11:14.458
- I wouldn't get too close to it either.
- Uh, thank you, Jack,

11:14.542 --> 11:15.750
but I think I know the difference

11:15.834 --> 11:18.166
between a groundhog and a porcupine, okay

11:20.417 --> 11:22.667
Are you looking for your mommy
or something, cutie?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.458
No, no?

11:32.500 --> 11:34.625
This dumb groundhog
thinks he's a porcupine.

11:35.792 --> 11:36.959
Now if you'll excuse me,

11:37.959 --> 11:39.125
I have to go over there.

11:45.959 --> 11:49.166
So, where is this big loyal army
you've been bragging about?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.834
Yeah, man. Where are they?

11:50.917 --> 11:52.375
I got this, Your highness.

11:53.041 --> 11:55.250
Yeah, we may be outnumbered,

11:55.375 --> 11:57.709
but my king has the heart of a lion

11:57.792 --> 12:00.041
and I have the speed of a-- a--

12:00.125 --> 12:01.834
You know, those animals
with the pointy ears

12:01.917 --> 12:03.667
- and they're really fast?
- Uh, a gazelle.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.834
Yeah. No, no.

12:05.917 --> 12:07.875
They're skinny
And they don't really run so much as--

12:07.959 --> 12:10.375
as just bound. And they kind of go grr!

12:10.458 --> 12:12.667
- Oh, it's right on the tip of my tongue.
- Squire.

12:15.542 --> 12:17.041
Let's just go over the rules.

12:17.583 --> 12:20.083
One, the first team
to capture the other's grail

12:20.166 --> 12:21.875
and place it on the pedestal of glory

12:21.959 --> 12:23.667
next to their own is the winner.

12:23.792 --> 12:26.959
Rule two, if you get struck on the chest,
you're out.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.291
Cheetah!

12:29.375 --> 12:31.750
Sorry, it's the animal
I was thinking of earlier.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.583
It just popped into my head.
I-- sorry, just keep going.

12:36.917 --> 12:39.709
Rule three, no cursing or foul language,

12:39.792 --> 12:42.917
unless it's a medieval word like "zounds."

12:43.000 --> 12:47.542
-
- Milton, you are better than that.

12:50.208 --> 12:51.291
Eh.

12:53.917 --> 12:56.542
- You've got a little something here.
- Where?

13:01.542 --> 13:02.542
Where were you?

13:02.625 --> 13:05.792
Let's just say I did something
I've never had to do before

13:05.875 --> 13:07.667
and hope I never have to do again.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.500
I felt that way when
I had to take my cats' temperature.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.875
They fight it. Oh, they fight it.

13:16.208 --> 13:17.792
You know what? I just realized...

13:18.583 --> 13:20.333
- I have a GPS on my phone.
- Oh.

13:20.417 --> 13:22.417
- I’ll get us out of these woods.
- No, no, no.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.208
- I said I’ll get us out And I will.
-

13:25.250 --> 13:27.917
Explorer Scouts do not rely on GPS.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.542
- Hey, give me that.
- Just--

13:30.625 --> 13:33.542
Now are you happy?
My phone just flew into that log.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.583
Relax, I’ll get it.

13:38.959 --> 13:40.667
Hey, I got it.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.083
-
- I think you got a call.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.000
it's starting to buzz.

13:45.375 --> 13:48.583
My phone's not buzzing. That's a beehive!

13:48.667 --> 13:50.125
Aah!

13:50.208 --> 13:52.834
-
- That's not mine either!

14:17.667 --> 14:20.458
- I think I lost them.
- What happened to you?

14:20.542 --> 14:22.166
I had a little mud situation.

14:23.208 --> 14:24.208
Ugh.

14:24.291 --> 14:26.208
Wow, I really hit my head.

14:26.291 --> 14:27.291
Is there a bump?

14:27.375 --> 14:29.917
J-just a teeny one.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Dude, your forehead is jacked up.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.375
Rudy, this looks bad.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.542
They'll be coming for our grail soon
and I think you should know

14:46.375 --> 14:47.834
I probably won't be going home with you.

14:48.250 --> 14:51.250
No, don't you talk like that.

14:51.375 --> 14:52.375
You're so young.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.875
You've got your whole life ahead of you.

14:53.959 --> 14:56.208
No, I won't be going home with you

14:56.291 --> 14:59.208
because my mom is picking me up here
to take me to the orthodontist.

15:00.959 --> 15:03.166
Look, whatever happens down there,

15:03.250 --> 15:05.375
It's been an honor to serve under you.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.959
Rudy, I’ve been thinking.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.041
If you're the only one who stood by me.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.333
I hereby dub thee

15:17.458 --> 15:19.875
Sir Rudy, my faithful knight.

15:21.208 --> 15:23.792
I can't believe this.
It's all happening so fast.

15:24.792 --> 15:26.875
Pretty good for a kid
from the wrong side of the tracks

15:26.959 --> 15:28.500
with nothing but a pocketful of dreams.

15:29.709 --> 15:32.166
Not gonna cry. Not gonna cry.

15:32.250 --> 15:33.625
Get it together, man.

15:35.417 --> 15:38.083
- We're going into battle.
- Yes.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.041
Charge!

15:47.667 --> 15:49.083
I think we finally lost the bees.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.667
-
- Where's Kim and Eddie?

15:51.750 --> 15:54.166
Oh, Kim got her hair tangled up
in a thorn bush.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.625
Eddie’s trying to get her out.

15:57.458 --> 16:01.041
It took a while, but I finally
got Kim’s head out of that bush.

16:01.125 --> 16:04.166
Luckily I have my official Explorer Scout
pocket knife.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.625
Guys, the battlefield's right over there.

16:09.709 --> 16:10.917
Come on.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.917
Eddie, even if you make it
out of this battle alive,

16:19.458 --> 16:20.667
Kim's gonna kill you.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.709
Wait, that was Kim?

16:27.750 --> 16:29.208
I don't think I have much left.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.500
My tights are riding up,

16:32.250 --> 16:33.583
I got sunblock in my eye,

16:34.542 --> 16:36.542
and if I don't get a potty break soon,

16:36.625 --> 16:38.542
something really bad's gonna happen.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.500
Something better not happen.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.458
Those pantaloons are rented.

16:43.542 --> 16:44.792
Battle on!

16:44.875 --> 16:46.750
We must protect the grail at all costs.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.333
It's over, Miltonious!

16:55.417 --> 16:57.333
Prepare to taste my foam.

17:02.458 --> 17:04.208
Ow!

17:04.291 --> 17:05.458
Who threw that?

17:08.750 --> 17:10.458
His army is made of ogres!

17:10.875 --> 17:13.750
Those aren't ogres, Those are my friends.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.291
Retreat! Retreat!

17:21.500 --> 17:23.083
You guys made it.

17:23.166 --> 17:26.125
This may not be our thing,
but if it means something to you,

17:26.208 --> 17:28.750
then we're with you, King Miltonius.

17:28.834 --> 17:29.792
Thank you.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.000
Who's the dude with the punked-out mullet?

17:36.083 --> 17:38.083
All right, guys, hands in.

17:38.834 --> 17:40.875
We've got us a grail to capture.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.917
Wasabi!

17:43.000 --> 17:45.083
- Charge!
-

17:45.750 --> 17:47.041
Ha!

17:49.583 --> 17:52.750
- Charge!
-

17:55.417 --> 17:56.709
Aah!

17:58.959 --> 18:00.959
Aah!

18:01.041 --> 18:02.208
Oh.

18:28.959 --> 18:30.792
- Hiya!
-

18:45.417 --> 18:47.625
Yeah! Don't mess with the Jack.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.750
Ya--

19:01.625 --> 19:03.000
Aah!

19:17.458 --> 19:18.583
Yes!

19:23.625 --> 19:25.000
Aah!

19:52.625 --> 19:53.917
Yeah.

20:18.792 --> 20:21.458
- Victory!
- Yeah!

20:21.542 --> 20:23.458
Oh! Come on.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.959
Yeah!

20:27.041 --> 20:28.959
Way to go, Milton. You did it.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.792
No, Jack, we did it.

20:32.709 --> 20:35.083
Here you go, Milton.
You've earned your gr--

20:38.750 --> 20:40.000
My hair.

20:41.166 --> 20:43.834
What happened to my hair?

20:46.583 --> 20:48.917
- Eddie?
-

20:49.000 --> 20:51.917
You are so dead!

20:52.041 --> 20:54.542
Aah!

20:56.166 --> 20:57.792
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:59.458 --> 21:00.625
Thanks again, guys.

21:00.709 --> 21:03.333
I know you were embarrassed
by those costumes.

21:03.417 --> 21:05.542
But don't worry,
you'll never have to wear them again

21:05.625 --> 21:07.709
and no one at school
will ever have to know.

21:07.792 --> 21:08.875
You're right, Milton,

21:08.959 --> 21:11.792
They don't, but they will.

21:22.417 --> 21:23.834
Call me.
