00:00.100 --> 00:01.300
<i>Previously on Greek:</i>

00:01.400 --> 00:04.800
- I know who started the fire.
- I did. But it was an accident.

00:04.810 --> 00:08.300
- Maybe someday you'll forgive me.
- For burning down my house?

00:08.310 --> 00:10.500
I'm gonna go before my
Benz turns into a pumpkin.

00:10.510 --> 00:11.300
Later.

00:11.310 --> 00:12.600
Sorry to leave you
hanging like that.

00:12.610 --> 00:14.600
At the Fairy Tale Ball.
Maybe I can make it up to you?

00:14.610 --> 00:16.400
- You mean, like a date?
- Yeah, like a date!

00:16.800 --> 00:18.800
- What are they doing?
- Dancing.

00:18.972 --> 00:21.006
- What's that?
- I think it's a joke.

00:21.041 --> 00:24.209
- I don't think it's funny.
- It's not a joke, and you and I will handle it.

00:31.150 --> 00:32.618
Hey, look who's home!

00:32.652 --> 00:34.920
Oh, wait, how many nights in a
row can you spend somewhere else

00:34.954 --> 00:36.588
before you have to start
calling that place home?

00:36.623 --> 00:39.157
Well, Cappie can't stay here,
so I'm kind of stuck commuting.

00:39.192 --> 00:41.393
I just miss our pre-sleep
gossip sessions.

00:41.427 --> 00:43.528
Last night, I took my laptop
to bed and fell asleep

00:43.563 --> 00:46.264
reviewing my old status
updates and TMZ videos.

00:46.299 --> 00:49.201
But isn't it nice having
this whole room to yourself?

00:49.235 --> 00:51.770
It's officially the biggest
single in the house,

00:51.804 --> 00:54.339
or in any sorority house
in the world.

00:54.374 --> 00:57.743
- I just miss you!
- Aw...

00:57.777 --> 01:00.579
- Oh! Oh, oh...
- What? What's wrong?

01:00.613 --> 01:03.248
- You kind of reek.
- I reek? Of what?

01:03.282 --> 01:05.951
Um... Oh, stale beer
and pepperoni.

01:05.985 --> 01:08.286
And... feet.

01:10.423 --> 01:13.125
I smell like the KT house?
I can't even tell.

01:13.159 --> 01:16.128
- I guess it grows on you.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

01:16.162 --> 01:17.963
So you didn't shower there?

01:17.997 --> 01:21.266
No, not when the shower
gets dubbed "the Vomitorium"

01:21.300 --> 01:23.201
during parties.

01:24.170 --> 01:26.905
Uh, Ash?

01:26.939 --> 01:30.108
- Was a boy here? - The All-Greek
Softball Tournament is this weekend.

01:30.143 --> 01:32.010
Of course!
How could I forget?

01:32.045 --> 01:33.712
It's worth five
Blue Ribbon points.

01:36.015 --> 01:39.317
it's a good chance for me to
meet a hot baseball-boy of my own.

01:39.352 --> 01:41.353
You're rdy to jump back
on the dating horse again?

01:41.387 --> 01:44.289
I'm ready to ride that horse
like a bucking bronco.

01:45.658 --> 01:48.593
- Awkward.
- Yeah, you might be all settled down and...

01:48.628 --> 01:52.197
...smelly, but I'm ready
to meet a fun new guy.

01:55.935 --> 01:59.504
- Nice shirt.
- Thanks, the pledges made it for me.

01:59.539 --> 02:02.374
I think they're starting to
respect me as a Pledge Educator.

02:02.408 --> 02:04.776
You think they misspelled it
on purpose, to be funny?

02:04.811 --> 02:07.345
- Like, school with a 'k'?
- I decided not to ask.

02:07.380 --> 02:10.348
- Hey! What's up, Rusty?
- What'd you call me, pledge?

02:10.383 --> 02:12.350
Uh... Rusty?
Or, wait, is it Randy?

02:12.385 --> 02:15.320
It's Rusty. But you should
call me by my KT name,

02:15.354 --> 02:17.689
which is Spitter.
Or Mr. Spitter.

02:17.724 --> 02:19.758
Where's your
pledge pin, pledge?

02:19.792 --> 02:21.526
It's supposed to be
on your shirt at all times.

02:21.561 --> 02:24.629
- It's in my backpack.
- Well, put it on.

02:26.165 --> 02:28.066
That's a funny shirt
you guys made.

02:28.101 --> 02:32.270
- What's so funny about it?
- Now? Nothing.

02:32.305 --> 02:35.006
- Bye, Dumptruck.
- Bye.

02:35.041 --> 02:38.443
Hey, so how are things with you and
Grant since you guys came out as a couple?

02:38.478 --> 02:41.646
Uh, great. The house
has really been supportive.

02:41.681 --> 02:43.615
You know, except for
the whole tiara incident.

02:43.649 --> 02:45.784
The tiara what?
Can I get a small coffee?

02:45.818 --> 02:49.187
Uh, someone left a couple of tiaras
on our door after the Fairy Tale Ball.

02:49.222 --> 02:50.455
But it's no big deal.
You know how it is,

02:50.490 --> 02:52.090
guys are always
making fun of each other.

02:52.125 --> 02:55.527
Guys make fun of me all
the time. And some girls.

02:55.561 --> 02:58.230
You know, I feel like I've barely
seen you since I've been dating Grant.

02:58.264 --> 03:00.999
- I know.
- You'd like him. He's actually a great guy.

03:01.033 --> 03:03.135
Spend some time with him
and you'd see what I mean.

03:03.169 --> 03:05.704
Maybe the three of us
could hang out tonight?

03:06.539 --> 03:08.006
Yeah. That sounds like fun.

03:08.975 --> 03:10.942
- What sounds like fun?
- Um...

03:10.977 --> 03:14.146
Well, I was just talking about the
three of us hanging out tonight.

03:14.180 --> 03:18.216
- The three of us? Fun.
- Yeah. It's gonna be really fun.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000

03:34.133 --> 03:36.334
Tell me again, why are
you crop-dusting my room

03:36.369 --> 03:38.637
with lemon-scented
cancer chemicals?

03:38.671 --> 03:40.906
Ash is trying
to meet a new guy

03:40.940 --> 03:42.741
and she's worried
about second-hand smell.

03:44.710 --> 03:47.379
Oh, God! What is this?

03:50.650 --> 03:55.053
Well, it's either a relatively
recent tuna fish sandwich

03:55.087 --> 03:57.322
or a really old
ham and shrimp one.

03:57.356 --> 03:59.291
Oh, just...

04:01.427 --> 04:04.162
So, Ash is in the market
for a new guy, huh?

04:04.197 --> 04:06.097
Uh, yeah, I was thinking
of setting her up

04:06.132 --> 04:09.835
with this Lambda Sig on IFC.
He's crazy hot.

04:09.869 --> 04:12.003
I mean,

04:12.038 --> 04:14.739
temperature-wise.
He sweats.

04:14.774 --> 04:16.274
Yeah.

04:16.309 --> 04:18.009
Or what about a nice KT?

04:18.043 --> 04:19.778
Then she could acclimate
to the smell by being around

04:19.812 --> 04:21.846
- the house more.
- I don't know.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.682
Ash has a really
sensitive nose.

04:23.716 --> 04:27.419
Oh, come on.
What about Beaver?

04:27.453 --> 04:29.221
He's just like
a big puppy dog,

04:29.255 --> 04:32.858
who doesn't know how to fetch,
but he's housebroken. Mostly.

04:32.892 --> 04:36.194
Right. I doubt Ash
will click with a guy

04:36.229 --> 04:40.599
who got a mild concussion from attempting
to parachute off the roof with a bed sheet.

04:40.633 --> 04:43.068
- Every guy tries that once when they're young.
- It was last semester.

04:43.102 --> 04:45.971
Yeah, but he's matured
a lot over the break.

04:46.005 --> 04:48.073
Come on, it's perfect.

04:49.275 --> 04:50.442
They're both tall.

04:51.677 --> 04:55.847
OK, he's really nice,
and cute...

04:55.882 --> 04:59.117
- Super cute.
- I guess it won't hurt to try, right?

05:02.855 --> 05:04.923
Seriously,
you don't smell this?

05:05.691 --> 05:06.958
No. What's wrong with this?

05:08.327 --> 05:09.494
It's just ripe.

05:10.796 --> 05:12.998
- What?
- Gosh...

05:14.634 --> 05:19.037
Then the miracle
of Vesuvius happened,

05:19.071 --> 05:24.509
as the cups were drained,
and beer rained down upon them

05:24.543 --> 05:28.947
like tears of joy
from the heavens above.

05:28.981 --> 05:31.149
OK, that's it
for today's lesson.

05:31.183 --> 05:34.019
But before we wrap up here,
I'd like to reiterate

05:34.053 --> 05:37.689
the importance of wearing
your pledge pins at all times.

05:37.723 --> 05:41.660
It is a constant reminder
that first and foremost,

05:41.694 --> 05:45.764
you are KTs
through and through.

05:45.798 --> 05:48.266
And I've caught
some of you slacking lately.

05:48.301 --> 05:51.436
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I kinda lost mine. You have any extras?

05:51.470 --> 05:54.072
Dumptruck, I saw you
wearing it two hours ago.

05:54.106 --> 05:55.774
Hey, you're the one who told me
to take it out of my backpack,

05:55.808 --> 05:57.008
where I knew
I wouldn't lose it.

05:58.444 --> 06:01.246
- Yeah, Anthony Hopkins?
- I lost mine, too.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.114
But actually, it was
the temporary one.

06:03.149 --> 06:04.916
I lost my first one
last semester.

06:04.951 --> 06:07.152
The temporary one
was my pledge pin!

06:07.186 --> 06:10.388
- It's gone?
- It's somewhere in the house...

06:10.423 --> 06:11.823
...or on campus.

06:11.857 --> 06:13.658
I'll just order
a few replacement pins.

06:13.693 --> 06:16.661
Does anyone else need one
while I'm at it? Yeah?

06:16.696 --> 06:19.931
Well, I still have mine,
but I know I'm a KT pledge.

06:19.966 --> 06:21.566
Do I really need a pin
to remind me?

06:21.600 --> 06:25.737
Yes, you do, OK?
It's a KT tradition.

06:25.771 --> 06:28.006
- It's a rule.
- But wee KTs, man.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.542
We're not supposed
to follow the rules, right?

06:30.576 --> 06:34.212
OK, fine. Well, just wear them
around the house, at the very least.

06:34.246 --> 06:37.515
And try not to lose them.
Meeting adjourned.

06:37.550 --> 06:41.519
Aw, that's so cute.
Rusty's acting like a man.

06:41.554 --> 06:45.423
It's not easy being a hard-ass when
your older sister is emasculating you.

06:49.328 --> 06:51.696
I will see you after class.
Bye, Rus.

06:51.731 --> 06:55.233
Hey, Cap, I have
a question for you.

06:55.267 --> 06:58.336
- When Casey was with Max, I know you didn't like him.
- That's correct.

06:58.371 --> 07:00.905
- No, no... That's not the question.
- Oh.

07:00.940 --> 07:03.074
I thought that was too easy.
Hit me with something harder.

07:03.109 --> 07:05.310
I have this problem.

07:05.344 --> 07:09.147
Calvin wants me to spend time with
his new boyfriend, who I cannot stand.

07:09.181 --> 07:13.251
Fortunately, that's an easy one, too.
Do what everyone does in that situation:

07:13.285 --> 07:16.187
simply pretend you like
each other in front of Calvin.

07:16.222 --> 07:19.324
What if I can't pretend?
'Cause I really don't like him.

07:19.358 --> 07:23.862
You don't have to like him,
you just have to tolerate him.

07:31.570 --> 07:34.305
Hey. You guys
are going out tonight?

07:34.340 --> 07:37.342
- Yep. You?
- Yeah, big date.

07:37.376 --> 07:39.377
How do I look?

07:39.412 --> 07:41.880
If you're gonna ask us how your
butt looks in those jeans, don't.

07:41.914 --> 07:46.684
- So, who's the lucky girl?
- Rebecca.

07:46.719 --> 07:48.586
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:48.621 --> 07:51.423
- You asked out Rebecca Logan?
- Actually, she asked me.

07:51.457 --> 07:53.258
So, if she pays
do you have to put out?

07:53.292 --> 07:55.860
Uh, only if I order steak.

07:55.895 --> 07:59.531
- So what are you guys doing?
- He's making me hang out with Rusty.

07:59.565 --> 08:01.833
- He's my friend.
- He's a KT.

08:01.867 --> 08:03.835
- And he can't stand me.
- Oh, yeah?

08:03.869 --> 08:05.370
What, you hit him upside the
head with a pledge paddle?

08:05.404 --> 08:08.173
No, but we duct-taped him
to a wall last year

08:08.207 --> 08:12.477
and then I accidentally got
his girlfriend to move away.

08:12.511 --> 08:16.281
- You got his girlfriend to move
away? - Do not high-five him.

08:18.984 --> 08:22.120
All right, guys. Hey, do
I look fat in these jeans?

08:30.229 --> 08:33.164
Do you realize how many
sweaty heads have worn this?

08:33.198 --> 08:34.765
Here, you can
put this inside.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.101
I haven't blown my nose
in it all day,

08:36.135 --> 08:37.302
and I just washed it
last week.

08:37.336 --> 08:40.839
Thanks. I think I'll
risk it with the helmet.

08:40.873 --> 08:43.475
- OK.
- OK...

08:43.509 --> 08:46.344
Let's go, Ash!

08:48.147 --> 08:50.882
Here we go. Whoo.

08:52.384 --> 08:54.986
That was supposed
to be a slow-pitch!

08:55.020 --> 08:57.288
That was way faster
than slow.

09:01.560 --> 09:06.698
- Ash, that was... so close.
- Close to what? Decapitation?

09:09.101 --> 09:11.402
All right. Here we go.

09:16.842 --> 09:20.311
Here, let me... I'm gonna show
you the proper way to handle a bat.

09:22.114 --> 09:25.283
OK. Oh, OK,
personal space, Beaver.

09:25.317 --> 09:28.119
And I really hope that was a
roll of tokens in your pocket.

09:28.154 --> 09:29.754
Gosh, just trying
to help with your swing.

09:31.490 --> 09:34.159
OK, first:
Stop winking at Cappie.

09:34.193 --> 09:37.095
And second: That was the most
cliched, sleazy date-movie move,

09:37.129 --> 09:39.464
- and you know it.
- I didn't know, I swear.

09:39.498 --> 09:40.798
You don't think
that was sleazy?

09:40.833 --> 09:42.600
I don't know
what clichÃƒÂ© means.

09:42.635 --> 09:45.570
OK, guys, we need to help
each other before the game,

09:45.604 --> 09:47.705
work with each other
during the game,

09:47.740 --> 09:50.441
and shower with each
other after the game.

09:50.476 --> 09:51.809
- You are just...
- OK, all right...

09:51.844 --> 09:54.846
Seriously, what do you think
about KT and ZBZ pairing up?

09:58.317 --> 10:00.752
Ash? What do you think?
Sounds good to me.

10:01.654 --> 10:02.754
Maybe...

10:02.788 --> 10:05.190
I think we have
to go to the bathroom.

10:05.224 --> 10:06.457
I don't need to go
to the bathroom.

10:06.492 --> 10:08.626
- I think she meant me.
- Oh.

10:09.695 --> 10:11.496
- Let's go.
- OK.

10:13.766 --> 10:15.533
Ah! Ow!

10:18.170 --> 10:20.138
Those don't look like
ginger ales.

10:20.172 --> 10:24.442
Pale ales. I figured these
could help ease the tension.

10:24.476 --> 10:25.977
Thank you, Grant.

10:27.279 --> 10:28.880
Just don't sell me out
if you get carded.

10:28.914 --> 10:33.084
But if you're looking for payback
for me duct-taping you to the wall,

10:33.118 --> 10:34.252
I guess
here's your chance.

10:34.286 --> 10:37.855
I just remembered:
I'm underage.

10:41.860 --> 10:45.496
But it's not like
I haven't had one before.

10:45.531 --> 10:47.966
And, Grant, forget about the whole
duct-taping-me- to-the-wall thing.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.002
It's in the past.
It was some stupid prank.

10:51.036 --> 10:55.039
Like those tiaras someone
left outside your door.

10:55.074 --> 10:58.109
Yes. Uh, which is
also in the past.

10:58.143 --> 11:00.545
Well, not really.
We don't know who did it.

11:00.579 --> 11:02.280
- And we don't care.
- I do.

11:02.314 --> 11:04.682
- And I think you should, too.
- It's not a big deal.

11:04.717 --> 11:07.652
Yeah, it seems
pretty harmless.

11:07.686 --> 11:11.489
- It didn't happen to you. - Nope.
But I was duct-taped to a wall.

11:11.523 --> 11:14.492
- I thought that was in the past.
- Hmm, like the tiaras.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.634
Boy, this sure is fun.

11:29.511 --> 11:31.812
So you really thought Beaver
would be a good match for me?

11:31.847 --> 11:35.316
- Well, you're both tall.
- Yeah, sure, we're both tall,

11:35.350 --> 11:37.952
and he's cute and
he's got big, manly biceps,

11:37.986 --> 11:40.588
- but he's just so...
- Sweet?

11:40.622 --> 11:43.791
...so mentally challenged.
No offense.

11:43.825 --> 11:47.895
I appreciate the thought. But I
just don't think KTs are my type.

11:50.465 --> 11:52.099
Hey, you two.

11:52.133 --> 11:54.134
We'd love to have ZBZ
over for a housewarming

11:54.169 --> 11:56.337
when our new place
is finished.

11:56.371 --> 11:58.405
Oh, but you already warmed
our house to the ground.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.408
Let it go, Natalie.
What's done is done.

12:01.443 --> 12:03.544
Thanks, Katherine,
we really appreciate it.

12:03.578 --> 12:06.747
Of course, ZBZ is still not
invited. On principle alone.

12:06.781 --> 12:10.351
I saw you guys
rehearsing with some KTs.

12:10.385 --> 12:12.853
Your partner, perhaps?

12:12.888 --> 12:15.656
It's nice to know some houses aren't
concerned with winning Blue Ribbon points.

12:18.059 --> 12:21.095
Well, we figure you've already
slept with all the umpires, so...

12:21.129 --> 12:22.796
And we haven't committed
to a partner

12:22.831 --> 12:24.732
because we are
concerned with winning,

12:24.766 --> 12:27.401
- so there.
- Well, you'd better choose soon,

12:27.435 --> 12:29.570
- because the pickings are slim.
- Oh, really?

12:29.604 --> 12:31.972
- Who are you playing with?
- The Omega Chi's.

12:32.007 --> 12:35.009
It's an obvious match. The number
one houses always play together.

12:35.043 --> 12:37.444
But you know that. ZBZ
used to play with them...

12:37.479 --> 12:40.347
- ...until you were number four.
- Ish.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:56.298 --> 13:01.535
- Oh, wait, can we split it?
- My pick, my treat.

13:01.570 --> 13:04.004
All right, fine.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.809
- But I'm treating next time.
- If there is a next time.

13:08.843 --> 13:10.578
We'll see how the rest
of tonight goes.

13:10.612 --> 13:14.081
Although, we may have
to choose something

13:14.115 --> 13:16.951
a little more
low-budget.

13:16.985 --> 13:22.656
No problem. We can go for coffee,
or a movie, or something simple.

13:23.625 --> 13:24.758
That's funny.

13:24.793 --> 13:28.462
'Cause we met,
we had sex, then dinner,

13:28.496 --> 13:31.932
and now coffee. It's like
we're moving backwards.

13:31.967 --> 13:35.869
Who knows, maybe after coffee
it'll be love at first sight.

13:35.904 --> 13:37.938
Love at first sight?
You really believe in that?

13:38.940 --> 13:41.408
You don't?

13:41.443 --> 13:43.911
I learned in my Human Sexuality
class it's purely chemical.

13:43.945 --> 13:46.780
The high you get from perceiving
someone as romantically appealing

13:46.815 --> 13:48.882
is simply your brain responding
to an endorphin boost

13:48.917 --> 13:51.485
based on visual stimuli
and pheromones.

13:51.519 --> 13:54.054
That's very clinical.
And cynical.

13:54.089 --> 13:58.158
- It's clinically cynical.
- It's a biological response.

13:58.193 --> 14:00.995
It's also probably why we jumped
right into bed when we first met.

14:01.029 --> 14:05.499
- So love doesn't exist?
- Nope.

14:05.533 --> 14:07.501
I believe in dating
and relationships,

14:07.535 --> 14:10.371
but love is a myth.

14:23.918 --> 14:25.352
So that went well last night.

14:25.387 --> 14:29.723
I tried to tolerate him, OK,
but he's just such a...

14:29.758 --> 14:32.993
...such an...
Omega Chi.

14:33.028 --> 14:36.397
- Hello? So am I.
- Yeah, but you don't flaunt it.

14:36.431 --> 14:39.099
- Excuse me?
- You know what I mean.

14:39.134 --> 14:41.035
I just can't spend time
with him. I'm sorry.

14:41.069 --> 14:43.070
We'll just have
to hang out separately.

14:43.104 --> 14:45.305
I'm sure he's not thrilled
to spend time with me, either.

14:45.340 --> 14:47.841
Fine. He's got a study
group tonight, anyway,

14:47.876 --> 14:51.145
- so if you don't have any plans...
- I don't have any plans.

14:52.247 --> 14:53.981
You see?
We can make this work.

14:54.015 --> 14:57.751
Yeah, but I refuse to be your
shared-custody child of divorce.

14:57.786 --> 15:00.354
You could have two birthdays
and two Christmases.

15:00.388 --> 15:02.690
One of you will have
to give in, eventually.

15:02.724 --> 15:04.858
Totally. Eventually.

15:09.798 --> 15:14.668
Hmm. I can't believe you guys
have poached eggs and hash browns!

15:14.703 --> 15:18.105
We have, like, cereal, milk,
and more cereal at our house.

15:18.139 --> 15:19.907
I am walking you home
every morning.

15:19.941 --> 15:22.843
It's nice to see chivalry isn't dead.

15:22.877 --> 15:24.945
Girls, the Omega Chi's are here!

15:27.849 --> 15:29.983
<i>Take me out
to the ball game...</i>

15:30.018 --> 15:32.553
<i>Take me out with the crowd...</i>

15:32.587 --> 15:36.623
<i>Buy me some peanuts
and Cracker Jacks...</i>

15:36.658 --> 15:39.393
<i>I don't care
if I never come back...</i>

15:39.427 --> 15:42.663
<i>Let me root, root root
for the home team...</i>

15:42.697 --> 15:45.365
<i>If they don't win
it's a shame...</i>

15:45.400 --> 15:48.435
<i>'Cause it's one, two,
three strikes you're out...</i>

15:48.470 --> 15:52.206
<i>At the old ball game...</i>

15:52.240 --> 15:54.675
Omega Chi would like
to cordially invite ZBZ

15:54.709 --> 15:58.078
to partner with us for the All-Greek
Softball Tournament this weekend.

15:58.113 --> 16:00.681
No, thank you!

16:00.715 --> 16:02.316
We're going with the KTs.

16:02.350 --> 16:04.384
You guys are a bunch of
douchebags. Please leave.

16:08.523 --> 16:10.290
It slipped, OK?

16:10.325 --> 16:13.594
It was buttered. I assure you
ladies that in no way reflects

16:13.628 --> 16:16.029
my ability to throw
an un-buttered softball.

16:16.064 --> 16:19.500
OK, so you guys really want
to play with the KTs

16:19.534 --> 16:23.337
after that... demonstration
of athleticism?

16:23.371 --> 16:26.039
Oh, Evan, come on. There's
no need for profanities here.

16:29.377 --> 16:32.613
Ash, the KTs
asked us first.

16:32.647 --> 16:34.014
ZBZ is a democracy,

16:34.048 --> 16:35.816
not "let's all hang out
with whatever house

16:35.850 --> 16:37.417
Casey's current
boyfriend's in."

16:37.452 --> 16:41.555
So, all those in favor of
partnering with the Omega Chi's

16:41.589 --> 16:43.123
for the softball
tournament?

16:46.928 --> 16:50.898
So, we cordially
accept your invitation.

17:05.271 --> 17:09.007
Ash, you kind of insulted
Cappie, and me, back there.

17:09.041 --> 17:12.044
I'm sorry, Case, but after
all that crap about the cycle,

17:12.078 --> 17:15.414
and slipping
to number four-ish,

17:15.448 --> 17:17.683
this is our chance to show
everyone that we're back on top.

17:17.717 --> 17:19.617
I mean, they asked us,
and not the Gamma Psi's.

17:19.652 --> 17:21.386
Don't you want to throw
this in Natalie's face?

17:21.421 --> 17:23.755
Attached to a brick.

17:23.790 --> 17:25.022
But why would
Omega Chi choose us?

17:25.058 --> 17:28.327
Because we're moving up!
This is huge!

17:28.361 --> 17:30.729
Are you so against this because
of your loyalty to Cappie?

17:30.763 --> 17:34.399
Or do you honestly believe it would
be better for us to play with KT

17:34.434 --> 17:38.570
than with the Omega Chi's?
You know I love Cappie,

17:38.604 --> 17:40.539
but this is for
the good of the house.

17:40.573 --> 17:43.175
And there's no "I"
in team. Or ZBZ.

17:43.209 --> 17:46.478
I know, I know. But the
KTs are so much more fun.

17:46.512 --> 17:49.648
Well, do you want to have fun,
or do you want to win?

17:56.122 --> 17:59.124
Isn't this fun?
Just the two of us?

17:59.158 --> 18:00.592
We haven't hung out
like this in a while.

18:00.626 --> 18:02.227
Yeah, this is great.

18:03.463 --> 18:06.131
Whoa, nice shot.

18:06.165 --> 18:08.000
Have you been practicing?

18:08.034 --> 18:10.402
You're destroying me.
Hey, after this,

18:10.436 --> 18:12.404
you wanna order a pizza
and play some video games?

18:12.438 --> 18:15.440
<i>- A little Call of Duty?
- Uh, yeah.</i>

18:15.475 --> 18:18.410
Hey, why don't we call Grant?
He's great at that game.

18:18.444 --> 18:20.879
Helped me get past that crazy
level with all the tanks.

18:21.981 --> 18:24.449
What?
I gotta keep trying.

18:24.484 --> 18:29.287
Spitter. Hey, man, I saw some pledges
not wearing their pledge pins again.

18:29.322 --> 18:31.490
It's no big deal.
I'm on it.

18:31.524 --> 18:35.427
Hey, Calvin. What's going on, man?
Haven't seen you around in a while.

18:35.461 --> 18:37.763
Not even the occasional
appearance at Gentleman's Choice.

18:37.797 --> 18:39.798
Yeah, I've been
a little bit domestic lately.

18:39.832 --> 18:41.867
Yeah, I heard you're dating
somebody in your own house now.

18:41.901 --> 18:45.871
- Who is that? Marco, right?
- Uh, no. Actually, his name is Grant.

18:45.905 --> 18:49.408
- Cute?
- You know, I just realized the two of you

18:49.442 --> 18:53.745
- look way too much alike.
- So insanely hot. Totally get it.

18:53.780 --> 18:56.615
Hey, Heath, we're just finishing
up our game. You wanna play winner?

18:56.649 --> 18:57.983
I thought we were
switching to video games?

18:58.017 --> 18:59.184
No, let's keep playing pool.

19:02.989 --> 19:05.524
Ah... Dang.

19:05.558 --> 19:07.292
You're up, Heath.

19:13.933 --> 19:15.767
I thought it was just
supposed to be the two of us?

19:15.802 --> 19:17.569
You know, separate time?

19:17.603 --> 19:20.305
And you pull this stuff
with me and Heath.

19:20.339 --> 19:22.040
Not cool, Rus.

19:22.075 --> 19:25.277
- Hey, I just figured...
- Hey, it was nice catching up.

19:25.311 --> 19:26.545
Yeah.

19:28.214 --> 19:30.482
Wait, he knows
he just won, right?

19:33.886 --> 19:37.322
So, I talked to Ash and she's
pretty set on playing with Omega Chi.

19:37.356 --> 19:39.191
And so are the rest
of the girls.

19:39.225 --> 19:41.860
You think Ashleigh's worried Beaver's
gonna date-movie molest her again?

19:41.894 --> 19:44.930
Because we had a talk, and
he's trying new clichÃƒÂ© moves.

19:44.964 --> 19:46.932
That's awesome.
But not the issue.

19:46.966 --> 19:50.102
ZBZ's just been doing
a lot with KT lately,

19:50.136 --> 19:53.538
and the girls want to
branch out and... maybe win.

19:53.573 --> 19:56.341
I totally understand.
KTs aren't jocks.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.643
- Mm-mmm. - We can't
run. We can't throw.

19:58.678 --> 20:00.712
Hell, we get winded
just tapping a keg.

20:00.746 --> 20:03.181
Hey, Case, can
I borrow your...

20:03.216 --> 20:05.183
Boy on the floor!

20:06.018 --> 20:07.285
- Whoa...
- I gotta go...

20:07.320 --> 20:09.621
She was a fiery little
pistol, wasn't she?

20:09.655 --> 20:12.157
Hey...

20:12.191 --> 20:13.892
- So you're not mad?
- No.

20:13.926 --> 20:15.527
But I must warn you,

20:15.561 --> 20:19.264
what we lack in physical
ability, we make up for in heart.

20:19.298 --> 20:23.068
And our hearts are set on crushing the
Omega Chi's at all things crushable.

20:23.102 --> 20:26.471
And I'm just sorry ZBZ will
become collateral damage.

20:26.506 --> 20:28.206
Oh, really? How do you
plan on crushing us?

20:28.241 --> 20:30.075
Well, since you're playing
with Omega Chi,

20:30.109 --> 20:33.612
we'll just have to team up with
some other very athletic sorority

20:33.646 --> 20:37.282
and kick your
very attractive asses.

20:37.316 --> 20:39.151
Oh, should I be scared?

20:40.186 --> 20:41.786
You care to make
a little friendly wager?

20:41.821 --> 20:46.825
- How much?
- Something much more valuable than money.

20:47.693 --> 20:49.494
How about, um...

20:49.529 --> 20:51.463
Sexual favors.

20:51.497 --> 20:56.001
- Let's skip the betting.
- Hmm, all right.

20:56.035 --> 20:58.236
- Thanks for the movie.
- Oh, yeah,

20:58.271 --> 21:00.438
<i>I can't believe that was your first
time to see The Princess Bride.</i>

21:00.473 --> 21:05.677
- It's a classic.
- "Mawwage." "Twoo wuv."

21:07.313 --> 21:09.881
Don't pretend like you
didn't tear up at the end.

21:09.916 --> 21:11.850
Maybe I did.
What's your point?

21:11.884 --> 21:14.386
- "Twoo wuv?"
- Please.

21:14.420 --> 21:17.422
It's a silly movie.
It's not real.

21:17.456 --> 21:19.324
There's no such thing.

21:19.358 --> 21:22.427
So you weren't
in love with Cappie?

21:22.461 --> 21:25.664
No. Were you in love
with Casey?

21:28.668 --> 21:30.035
Yeah. I think so.

21:30.069 --> 21:32.037
Yeah, well,
you're not with her now,

21:32.071 --> 21:33.805
so what does that say
about "twoo wuv?"

21:33.839 --> 21:36.107
It doesn't mean
it can't happen.

21:36.142 --> 21:39.244
Like it did with my parents?
Or yours?

21:39.278 --> 21:41.279
Not exactly
the earth-shattering,

21:41.314 --> 21:44.583
life-altering revelation they
make it out to be in the movies.

21:44.617 --> 21:46.318
That doesn't mean
it's not real.

21:47.253 --> 21:48.954
Do you have proof?

21:48.988 --> 21:50.622
No. I just
believe in it.

21:51.624 --> 21:53.858
I believed
in Santa Claus once, too.

22:00.499 --> 22:05.203
I'm really sorry, Calvin.
You're right. That wasn't cool.

22:05.238 --> 22:06.838
Grant can have you
this weekend.

22:06.872 --> 22:08.306
Grant might have me
every weekend

22:08.341 --> 22:09.641
if you keep
pulling crap like that.

22:09.675 --> 22:11.710
I know.

22:11.744 --> 22:14.079
I just saw you and Heath
together, and...

22:14.113 --> 22:16.748
...it was really selfish.
I feel like a real jerk.

22:19.151 --> 22:21.419
You know, if we're gonna do
this whole "separate" thing,

22:21.454 --> 22:23.054
you might have
to go somewhere else.

22:23.089 --> 22:25.056
Calvin told you
about that, huh?

22:25.091 --> 22:27.325
Yeah, I had to be
honest with him.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.329
- What are you doing here?
- I came to apologize for what happened with Heath.

22:31.364 --> 22:32.597
Who's Heath?

22:35.635 --> 22:38.703
- You said you were nest.
- Not unnecessarily honest.

22:38.738 --> 22:40.939
Calvin, who is Heath?

22:40.973 --> 22:45.777
Uh, well, Heath is an ex,
um... something.

22:45.811 --> 22:47.946
I don't really know
what to call him.

22:47.980 --> 22:52.217
It's... We definitely weren't
boyfriends. We just sort of dated,

22:52.251 --> 22:54.185
sort of...

22:54.220 --> 22:56.855
What do you call
someone who's like that?

22:56.889 --> 22:58.023
Fun-buddy.

23:01.594 --> 23:04.262
- Wh...
- You know, why am I nervous?

23:04.297 --> 23:07.666
I didn't do anything wrong. Rusty
was the one who tried to hook me up

23:07.700 --> 23:10.702
with an ex fun-buddy.
But see, I just left.

23:10.736 --> 23:13.438
He got out of there, and I
came to apologize for that.

23:13.472 --> 23:17.142
Because that was wrong.
That was very wrong.

23:17.176 --> 23:18.910
This is the guy you want me
to be friends with?

23:18.944 --> 23:21.680
Neither of us
are interested.

23:21.714 --> 23:24.516
Just give it a rest,
Calvin.

23:24.550 --> 23:26.184
Girlfriend on the rag,
Owens?

23:27.520 --> 23:29.020
I'm his boyfriend, J.P.

23:29.055 --> 23:32.324
Grant, he was just
messing around, OK?

23:41.667 --> 23:44.235
Your boyfriend's
super cute, Case.

23:44.270 --> 23:46.338
I don't know how I'd feel
about him playing with

23:46.372 --> 23:50.241
a sorority full of mostly single,
attractive, quality girls like Gamma Psi.

23:50.276 --> 23:55.280
I just hope the fact that ZBZ is playing
with Omega Chi doesn't harm your relationship.

23:55.314 --> 23:57.482
Well, good luck tomorrow!

24:00.453 --> 24:03.254
Gamma Psi's playing with
the KTs? How'd that happen?

24:03.289 --> 24:06.891
- Uh... they asked us.
- And how'd that happen?

24:06.926 --> 24:10.562
I think they waited so long, KT and
Psi Phi Pi were the only houses left.

24:10.596 --> 24:15.166
And, apparently, our desire to crush
the Omega Chi's gave us the edge.

24:15.201 --> 24:17.869
With ZBZ as collateral
damage, that is.

24:17.903 --> 24:22.907
She gave me the schedule, and apparently KT
and ZBZ will be playing together, after all.

24:24.343 --> 24:28.213
- Except on opposing teams.
- You're going down.

24:36.073 --> 24:39.776
- Hey!
- KT, I'm so glad you could join us.

24:39.810 --> 24:42.612
- Oh, we're glad to be here. - That
was sarcasm. You're late for warm-ups.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.381
You were serious
about warm-ups?

24:44.415 --> 24:47.050
- I'm always serious.
- She is.

24:48.386 --> 24:50.153
OK.

24:50.187 --> 24:53.189
Hey, teammate!
Captains' meeting at home plate.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.694
Neat whistle.

24:57.728 --> 25:02.632
And your practice
looks very... militant.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.402
I never thought you'd be so
gung-ho about a softball tournament.

25:05.436 --> 25:07.370
You know, I might be
beyond sorority politics,

25:07.405 --> 25:08.838
but I am gung-ho
about winning.

25:10.908 --> 25:13.209
Ladies, don't make me
call your mothers!

25:14.712 --> 25:16.313
Play ball!

25:46.243 --> 25:47.644
Get it, get it, get it!

25:57.188 --> 25:59.222
Pledges! I got a hit.

25:59.256 --> 26:02.425
- Congratulations.
- Really awesome, Mr. Spitter.

26:02.460 --> 26:06.730
Will you put down the cards
and show some KT pride? Look!

26:06.764 --> 26:08.331
You should be cheering.

26:11.369 --> 26:12.335
You should be running.

26:35.693 --> 26:37.260
Atta boy now!

26:48.472 --> 26:50.840
- Safe!
- Are you blind, ump?!

26:50.875 --> 26:53.143
He was out! Are you crazy?

26:53.177 --> 26:55.945
He was out! What are
you doing?! Are you an idiot?

26:55.980 --> 26:58.648
- What are you talking about?
- He was out!

26:58.682 --> 27:02.285
- He clearly plopped on home plate. How was he safe?
- Come on!

27:05.423 --> 27:08.224
- The ump's on the take!
- What did he take?

27:08.259 --> 27:10.627
Guys! We'll get the next one,
all right?

27:10.661 --> 27:14.063
- He was out!
- Aww, man! This is so gay!

27:14.098 --> 27:16.332
- Grant...
- Really, Trip? What was gay about it?

27:16.367 --> 27:18.802
I didn't mean it like that. I
just meant it was a lame call.

27:18.836 --> 27:20.170
Hey, maybe this
isn't the time...

27:20.204 --> 27:22.539
I just want to make sure he
understands those two words

27:22.573 --> 27:23.640
mean completely
different things.

27:23.674 --> 27:25.208
Dude, don't be so touchy.

27:25.242 --> 27:27.477
Grant, just drop
the gay stuff, OK?

27:27.511 --> 27:29.546
- He's right. It's not cool.
- Shut up, douche.

27:29.580 --> 27:32.615
Hey, hey! You touch the douche,
and we're out, OK?

27:32.650 --> 27:35.418
Can you get thrown out of a game
for fighting with your own team?

27:35.453 --> 27:38.388
- Yeah. Break it up! Everyone back on the field!
- Let's go.

27:39.657 --> 27:41.491
Will you just
chill out?

27:43.227 --> 27:44.394
Play ball!

27:57.808 --> 27:59.742
All right, let's go, team!
Let's take these losers out!

28:01.011 --> 28:03.646
- Yeah, good one...
- Who wants some?!

28:03.681 --> 28:05.582
Come on, Cap!
Hit a double play!

28:07.051 --> 28:08.485
Come on, Cappie!

28:20.764 --> 28:22.832
Hey, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter!

28:29.039 --> 28:30.406
That was overhand!

28:35.513 --> 28:37.413
- Time!
- Time out!

28:38.749 --> 28:39.916
- Evan?
- What?

28:39.950 --> 28:40.884
What the hell?

28:40.918 --> 28:41.951
You could've
really hurt him.

28:41.986 --> 28:43.186
It was an accident.

28:43.220 --> 28:45.121
OK, well, be more careful.
This is a friendly game.

28:45.155 --> 28:46.890
Oh, like you
and the Gamma Psi's?

28:48.659 --> 28:50.793
Hey, wait.
Can I ask you something?

28:50.828 --> 28:52.829
- Uh...
- Were we in love?

28:52.863 --> 28:56.566
What? Is that why you
nearly took off his head?

28:56.600 --> 29:00.570
- Are you still...?
- No! This isn't about us.

29:00.604 --> 29:03.806
I'm dating Rebecca. Well,
we've gone out, like, twice.

29:03.841 --> 29:05.408
But she said she doesn't
believe in love.

29:05.442 --> 29:08.111
- Any day now!
- And I can't believe

29:08.145 --> 29:09.913
that we're talking
about this here, now.

29:09.947 --> 29:13.116
- Well...
- You've gone out twice. Relax. OK?

29:13.150 --> 29:14.551
Are you talking
about me and Evan?

29:14.585 --> 29:15.818
No.

29:15.853 --> 29:19.489
I'm bored. Nothing happens
out there. And he's cute.

29:19.523 --> 29:21.791
Call him over,
I want to meet him.

29:21.825 --> 29:23.259
Guys, we're in
the middle of a game!

29:23.294 --> 29:26.162
- But what does it matter if...
- What's his name?

29:27.531 --> 29:29.566
- Play ball!
- Evan!

29:29.600 --> 29:32.335
Relax. Rebecca, don't mess
with people's emotions.

29:32.369 --> 29:34.537
Ash, there will be time to flirt
when we're not in an inning.

29:34.572 --> 29:37.140
Now, everyone get back
to your positions, OK?!

29:37.174 --> 29:38.675
And strike out
my boyfriend.

29:40.210 --> 29:42.745
Come on, Cap!
Hit a grand slam!

29:42.780 --> 29:45.081
The bases aren't loaded,
but thank you!

29:47.117 --> 29:49.485
- Come on, Cappie!
- Come on, play ball!

30:09.340 --> 30:11.608
You OK?

30:11.642 --> 30:14.677
I'm fine. Just hope
my lungs don't explode.

30:15.613 --> 30:17.981
Did you see
that line drive?

30:18.015 --> 30:20.216
Payback's a bitch, huh?

30:20.250 --> 30:23.086
- His was an accident. I think.
- So was mine.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.821
You think my aim's that good?

30:24.855 --> 30:27.690
And you're defending him now?
I see where your loyalties are.

30:27.725 --> 30:30.627
On this field, I am first
and foremost a ZBZ,

30:30.661 --> 30:33.396
- with "Cappie's girlfriend" a close second.
- Ouch, by the way.

30:33.430 --> 30:36.399
- I'd put you above winning.
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

30:36.433 --> 30:39.602
I'll prove it to you.
I will lob you easy pitches.

30:39.637 --> 30:41.504
You can stare 'em down
and let me strike you out,

30:41.538 --> 30:44.173
- or you can swing away.
- Or you could walk me.

30:44.208 --> 30:47.343
I want to beat the Gamma Psi's just as
bad as you want to beat the Omega Chi's.

30:47.378 --> 30:51.914
Good point. Well, we'll have
to wait and see what happens.

30:53.050 --> 30:54.017
You're just...

30:56.220 --> 30:59.722
Seriously, though, the Omega Chi's
got three of my brothers expelled.

30:59.757 --> 31:01.758
I've never wanted
to win more in my life.

31:04.361 --> 31:06.929
Although, you can't win just by
getting on base, know what I mean?

31:11.702 --> 31:14.037
All you have to do
is get on base.

31:14.071 --> 31:15.805
- No pressure, huh?
- All right.

31:17.941 --> 31:21.110
- Let's go, Casey!
- "And then, responding to the cheers,

31:21.145 --> 31:25.248
she lightly doffed her hat. No
stranger in the crowd could doubt

31:25.282 --> 31:29.719
- 'twas Casey at the bat."
- Rusty, I am trying to concentrate.

31:29.753 --> 31:32.822
I memorized that poem
in, like, fourth grade.

31:46.336 --> 31:47.804
Strike one!

31:50.307 --> 31:51.507
Come on, Zeta Beta!

31:53.110 --> 31:54.043
Throw the heat!

31:57.881 --> 32:00.016
- Strike two!
- Whoo!

32:06.790 --> 32:08.157
One more, Cappie!

32:09.093 --> 32:11.160
- Time! Time!
- Time out!

32:11.195 --> 32:14.430
My foot fell asleep. Rusty,
can I talk to you? Come here.

32:20.804 --> 32:24.841
I am no doctor, Case. Try noving it
around a little. Get the blood flowing.

32:24.875 --> 32:28.044
It's not my foot. It's Cappie.
Should I throw the game for him,

32:28.078 --> 32:31.080
- or make a hit so ZBZ can win?
- What?

32:31.115 --> 32:33.082
Because we really need
the Blue Ribbon points.

32:33.117 --> 32:36.018
Then try to get a hit out there.
You're playing for ZBZ.

32:36.053 --> 32:39.455
Although, I could understand
putting a personal relationship

32:39.490 --> 32:41.424
above house feuds.

32:44.795 --> 32:46.629
Well, that doesn't
help me at all.

32:46.663 --> 32:48.097
What do you want me to say?
I don't...

32:48.132 --> 32:50.933
- Play ball!
- Go, Casey!

32:57.775 --> 32:59.475
Come on, one more, Cap!

34:11.735 --> 34:14.103
I told you we should have
gone with the Psi Phi Pi's.

34:16.474 --> 34:18.842
Well, congrats on your win.

34:18.876 --> 34:20.911
I would say a full
"congratulations,"

34:20.945 --> 34:25.449
but I removed the second half of the
word for your Omega Chi teammates.

34:25.483 --> 34:28.318
I refuse to offer them
any "ulations."

34:28.351 --> 34:32.022
Thanks. And thanks for
throwing me easy pitches.

34:32.056 --> 34:34.558
It was slow-pitch. You were
supposed to strike out for me.

34:34.592 --> 34:37.460
I'm sorry! I know you wanted
to beat the Omega Chi's,

34:37.495 --> 34:41.498
but we needed the Blue Ribbon points
to help us get back to number one.

34:41.532 --> 34:44.634
- And I like to win.
- Really?

34:44.668 --> 34:45.835
Just because
we're in a relationship

34:45.870 --> 34:47.337
doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop trying.

34:47.371 --> 34:49.406
So it wasn't just about
Blue Ribbon points?

34:51.476 --> 34:52.976
You think
I'm too competitive?

34:53.010 --> 34:56.413
It's one of the things
I love most about you.

35:01.586 --> 35:03.787
- Oh, hey. Hi.
- Hey, Casey.

35:03.821 --> 35:06.523
Is Ashleigh in attendance?

35:08.125 --> 35:12.829
I wish to apologize for my
inappropriate advances the other night.

35:12.864 --> 35:15.298
And...

35:18.135 --> 35:20.637
It would please me
very much

35:20.671 --> 35:23.673
to escort her
to dinner and a movie.

35:25.142 --> 35:26.510
Appropriately.

35:29.080 --> 35:33.683
Oh, yeah, I saw her a second
ago... Oh, um, there she is.

35:37.822 --> 35:39.456
Beav...

35:43.227 --> 35:45.061
How you doin'?

35:46.831 --> 35:48.498
He'll be fine.

35:53.838 --> 35:55.872
What's up?

35:55.907 --> 35:58.508
Can you believe that
back there?

35:58.543 --> 36:01.645
I just wish Grant
would chill sometimes.

36:01.679 --> 36:03.013
I don't know.

36:04.682 --> 36:08.251
Hey, I may not like Grant
for my own personal reasons,

36:08.286 --> 36:10.720
but I think he was right
to tell that guy off.

36:10.755 --> 36:14.157
He was standing up for himself.
I think you should, too.

36:14.191 --> 36:16.626
Are you trying to
tell me how to be gay?

36:16.661 --> 36:19.429
- Because you don't know what it's like.
- I know. You're right.

36:19.463 --> 36:21.565
Listen, I was made
fun of in high school

36:21.599 --> 36:25.268
and I never stood up
for myself. I wish I did.

36:25.303 --> 36:27.203
I wish I was more
like Grant back then.

36:31.275 --> 36:32.943
Hey.

36:37.248 --> 36:40.483
- Good game, Grant.
- Thanks.

36:40.518 --> 36:43.920
And thanks for the support on
the whole "that's so gay" thing.

36:47.391 --> 36:51.728
OK, I am sorry. All right?
Yes, it offends me, too.

36:51.762 --> 36:56.032
But, Grant, when you stand up like
that, you make our whole relationship

36:56.067 --> 36:58.635
this huge political statement.

36:58.669 --> 37:00.470
And it doesn't
have to be like that.

37:01.939 --> 37:03.073
I mean,
times have changed.

37:03.107 --> 37:05.141
It's not like it was
50 years ago.

37:05.176 --> 37:09.479
You're right. Times are changing,
but they haven't changed.

37:09.513 --> 37:12.649
I wasn't ready to come out
of the closet for a reason.

37:13.851 --> 37:15.452
I do think
it's my responsibility

37:15.486 --> 37:20.156
to stand up for myself, because
I want to be proud of who I am.

37:21.892 --> 37:25.929
And not allow other people
to make me feel bad about it.

37:29.634 --> 37:30.634
See?

37:32.370 --> 37:34.004
I told you
he was great.

37:41.679 --> 37:43.380
Grant Ellis.

37:44.348 --> 37:46.583
Educating straight people
since...

37:46.617 --> 37:48.251
...last week.

37:54.358 --> 37:57.060
You look pretty hot in uniform.

37:58.763 --> 38:00.664
You look pretty hot
in anything.

38:03.234 --> 38:06.036
Why'd you guys choose us
over the Gamma Psi's?

38:06.070 --> 38:08.672
- Aren't they the number one house?
- Well, um...

38:08.706 --> 38:11.941
I might have done some
lobbying on ZBZ's behalf,

38:11.976 --> 38:15.345
for, um...
personal reasons.

38:19.250 --> 38:21.651
- About our conversation the other night...
- Right.

38:21.686 --> 38:25.522
Don't even worry about that.
Because all I want to know now is:

38:25.556 --> 38:27.057
When's our next date?

38:29.860 --> 38:33.563
Hey, guys! So, Pete
just had a great idea.

38:33.597 --> 38:35.865
He thinks the four of us should go
out on a double-date next weekend.

38:35.900 --> 38:36.933
What do you think, Rebecca?

38:39.136 --> 38:41.938
Oh, yes! A double-date
next week. Neat.

38:41.972 --> 38:44.407
- Yeah!
- What do you think, Evan?

38:44.442 --> 38:46.209
I think it's a great idea.

38:48.012 --> 38:49.345
OK.

38:55.820 --> 38:57.854
I'm glad you're spending
the night here tonight.

38:57.888 --> 39:00.123
We have so much gossip
to catch up on,

39:00.157 --> 39:01.524
I don't even know
where to start.

39:01.559 --> 39:03.827
- Well, Cappie and I...
- Wait! Yes, I do.

39:03.861 --> 39:07.163
The cute Omega Chi playing
left-base asked me out!

39:07.198 --> 39:10.100
I know.
You've told me about 20 times.

39:10.134 --> 39:14.003
Did I mention that Beaver was
looking for you at Dobler's?

39:14.038 --> 39:15.739
Are you trying to ruin
my new boy buzz?

39:15.773 --> 39:18.374
No, I just miss you.

39:18.409 --> 39:20.677
And now you're double-dating
with Evan and Rebecca

39:20.711 --> 39:24.647
- instead of me and Cappie.
- Well...

39:24.682 --> 39:28.752
Maybe by the time I marry Pete, the KT
- Omega Chi feud will be over.

39:28.786 --> 39:31.855
And Cappie can even be
in the wedding party.

39:31.889 --> 39:37.193
Oh. You know, I almost let Cappie
talk me out of winning today.

39:37.228 --> 39:40.130
- Wow. Someone found the "I" in team.
- No.

39:40.164 --> 39:43.133
I meant, us. ZBZ.

39:43.167 --> 39:44.834
And for a second there,

39:44.869 --> 39:48.772
I was considering
striking out for him.

39:51.142 --> 39:52.809
Should I have?

39:52.843 --> 39:56.546
I mean, when am I supposed to compromise
what I want for a relationship?

40:00.184 --> 40:03.653
This is going to be
trickier than I thought.

40:09.426 --> 40:12.061
Oh, I saw you talking
to Calvin at Dobler's.

40:12.096 --> 40:14.531
- How's all that going?
- Well...

40:14.565 --> 40:18.835
I tried to tolerate Grant, like
you said. But it didn't work out.

40:18.869 --> 40:21.638
- Too much of a jerk, huh?
- Yeah.

40:21.672 --> 40:25.175
But not him. I was the jerk.
I couldn't see past the fact

40:25.209 --> 40:26.810
that he's an Omega Chi.

40:26.844 --> 40:29.846
But today, I saw
a side of him I liked.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.581
The side of him
that looks like Heath?

40:31.615 --> 40:34.651
I'm not saying we're best
friends or anything like that,

40:34.685 --> 40:35.952
but it's a start.

40:38.289 --> 40:40.924
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Dumptruck?

40:43.194 --> 40:46.863
- Where's your pledge pin?
- Right here. Chill.

40:46.897 --> 40:50.099
- Take it off your pants.
- Take off my pants?

40:50.134 --> 40:53.503
No, take the pin off your pants,
and put it on your shirt,

40:53.537 --> 40:57.807
where it's supposed to be. It's your
responsibility to be proud of who you are.

40:57.842 --> 41:01.845
That pin is a symbol
of KT pride and tradition.

41:01.879 --> 41:06.549
The second you stop respecting
that, then someone else does,

41:06.584 --> 41:08.351
then someone else
does...

41:09.520 --> 41:11.621
...then it means
nothing anymore.

41:15.993 --> 41:18.661
OK. Now get back in there
and join your brothers.

41:18.696 --> 41:20.964
Let's get this show
on the road.

41:20.998 --> 41:24.300
- Go Pledge Educator Spitter.
- Yep. Rusty Cartwright.

41:24.335 --> 41:29.038
Educating KT pledges
since... right now.

41:29.073 --> 41:30.573
Up top.

41:30.608 --> 41:34.811
- What movie are we watching?
- The best baseball movie ever.

41:34.845 --> 41:36.579
- Field of Dreams?
- Bull Durham?

41:36.614 --> 41:38.581
The Natural?

41:52.997 --> 41:55.531
A League of Their Own.

41:55.566 --> 41:58.701
- I love this movie so much.
- Beaver!

41:58.736 --> 42:02.005
"There's no crying
in baseball."

42:02.039 --> 42:06.509
Fade in. The year is 1943
in Rockford, Illinois,

42:06.543 --> 42:10.313
and World War II has threatened
to shut down Major League Baseball.

42:10.347 --> 42:11.981
Oh, no...

42:12.016 --> 42:13.917
But not if Madonna
can help it.

42:13.951 --> 42:15.852
That's right!
