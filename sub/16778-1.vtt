10:09.600 --> 10:11.723
Good morning, sir.

10:42.466 --> 10:45.104
It's a damn strange business, Tom.

10:45.469 --> 10:49.424
A man literally shredded to death
right in the heart of London.

10:49.556 --> 10:51.430
That's the last one.

10:51.558 --> 10:56.683
Bats appearing out of nowhere...
I don't know, it just doesn't make sense.

10:56.814 --> 10:59.601
Nasty-looking little blighters, aren't they?

10:59.733 --> 11:02.568
Seen them in Mandalay.
Suck your throat dry, they would.

11:02.695 --> 11:06.360
Well, that's where they belong,
in the tropics, not here.

11:06.490 --> 11:11.235
All right, take them off to the laboratory.
And have them checked for rabies.

11:11.745 --> 11:14.319
- Now, Morgan...
- Yes, sir?

11:14.456 --> 11:16.496
- Where the hell are you?
- Up here.

11:16.625 --> 11:21.038
I want you to question the butler again.
There may be something he overlooked.

11:21.171 --> 11:22.369
Very good, sir.

11:22.506 --> 11:25.424
Remember when you were
in Scotland last week?

11:25.551 --> 11:29.299
There was another surgeon who died.
A Dr Thornton.

11:29.430 --> 11:33.926
- What about him?
- It's how he died. This reminded me of it.

11:34.059 --> 11:38.139
He was stung... to death by bees
in his library.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.640
Bees in his library?

11:42.484 --> 11:46.019
That's right. The place
must've been swarming with 'em.

11:46.155 --> 11:48.194
I've got the file on my desk.

11:48.324 --> 11:53.614
You should've seen his face. The whole
flesh was a mass of... well, boils.

11:53.746 --> 11:57.328
- Boils?
- All over. Stings, I suppose.

11:57.458 --> 12:00.624
I wonder if there is a connection.

12:00.753 --> 12:03.422
Well, I'll go through the file.

12:03.547 --> 12:07.841
God knows what we've got.
Two doctors, both dead...

12:09.345 --> 12:13.971
Oh, don't take him out like that!
At least cover his face up.

12:14.099 --> 12:15.759
What's left of it.

13:41.186 --> 13:45.765
Good God.
Nobody told me this was a masked affair.

13:46.317 --> 13:47.776
For me?

13:48.944 --> 13:51.233
How very elegant.

13:53.282 --> 13:55.571
But, my dear fellow...

13:56.535 --> 13:58.907
it's beautiful.

14:13.469 --> 14:16.423
I say, jolly fine party, what?

14:17.222 --> 14:21.386
Don't believe we've met.
My name's Hargreaves. Dr Hargreaves.

14:21.518 --> 14:25.516
I'm a psychiatrist, actually.
Head shrinker.

14:29.944 --> 14:33.313
I say, would you mind?
Some fancy catch.

14:39.453 --> 14:44.032
Much obliged.
Now, point me towards the ladies.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.364
Thank you.

14:51.548 --> 14:54.218
I say, is that you, Freda?

15:06.647 --> 15:09.220
This mask is jolly tight.

16:22.598 --> 16:25.634
Absolutely not.
We're short-staffed as it is,

16:25.768 --> 16:30.394
and you want more men to charge off
on one of your half-baked theories?

16:30.522 --> 16:33.310
- Medical men die every day.
- I'm aware of that, sir.

16:33.442 --> 16:35.850
They're flesh and blood, like you and I.

16:35.986 --> 16:41.407
I'm aware of that too. I've seen
rather a lot of their flesh and blood lately.

16:42.660 --> 16:46.075
And another thing -
suppose the press get hold of this?

16:46.205 --> 16:51.495
Don't talk to me about the press, Trout.
Keep your ideas to yourself on that one.

16:51.627 --> 16:56.503
Mention this to the press and they'd
whip up a panic story overnight.

16:56.632 --> 16:58.423
There'd be an uproar.

16:58.550 --> 17:01.754
- It was not my intention.
- It's certainly not mine.

17:01.887 --> 17:03.844
I want no statements.

17:03.973 --> 17:09.845
Can you imagine what they'd make
of bats, bees and... and what?

17:09.979 --> 17:12.730
- Frogs.
- Exactly.

17:13.648 --> 17:16.318
Why don't you go
and reread <i>Aesop's Fables?</i>

17:16.443 --> 17:20.192
Perhaps you'll come up
with a more pertinent theory. That's all.

17:20.321 --> 17:23.442
Three men have died,
all in the medical profession.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.991
- Does that not suggest...
- No, it damn well doesn't.

17:27.121 --> 17:30.324
Some very strange people
practise medicine these days.

17:52.187 --> 17:54.263
- Dr Longstreet?
- Agh...

17:54.398 --> 17:56.640
- Mrs Frawley.
- I'm off.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.318
- You're what?
- Off.

17:58.444 --> 17:59.523
Oh, yes. Yes.

17:59.653 --> 18:02.144
Sure you don't mind me
having the evening off?

18:02.281 --> 18:05.614
No, no. I shall rather enjoy it.
I mean, have a good time.

18:05.743 --> 18:10.570
- I've got you some cold brawn.
- Oh, that sounds delicious.

18:10.706 --> 18:15.083
I won't be back late.
I'll be back before midnight.

18:15.210 --> 18:18.544
You don't have to hurry -
you won't turn into a pumpkin.

18:18.672 --> 18:21.210
I don't know, though.

19:11.141 --> 19:13.217
Mrs Frawley!

19:13.352 --> 19:15.890
Dr Longstreet, we are naughty, aren't we?

19:16.021 --> 19:18.939
Haven't touched our supper, have we?

19:19.066 --> 19:23.111
- And what is this?
- This? Well, it's...

19:23.237 --> 19:28.278
Oh, I see what you mean. It's a new thing
on the market. It keeps out draughts.

19:28.409 --> 19:29.660
Dra...

20:27.593 --> 20:32.136
I'm... I'm Dr Longstreet, you know.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.145
Who's this?

21:20.104 --> 21:22.642
- How did it go, Harry?
- It didn't.

21:22.773 --> 21:26.937
It came to a grinding halt.
All he's worried about is the press.

21:27.069 --> 21:29.026
They've been on, of course.

21:29.154 --> 21:33.069
I've killed it, don't worry.
I'm sitting on the lab reports.

21:33.200 --> 21:38.443
I don't care what the old man says, Tom.
There is a definite pattern here.

21:38.580 --> 21:42.246
- Is there anything in there?
- It's correspondence, family...

21:42.376 --> 21:45.293
- What does it tell us?
- They have one thing in common.

21:45.421 --> 21:48.172
If you say they all died mysteriously,
I'll kill you.

21:48.299 --> 21:50.421
- Vesalius.
- What?

21:50.551 --> 21:52.259
Dr Vesalius.

21:53.595 --> 21:57.261
- Funny name. Who the hell's he?
- They all worked for him.

21:57.391 --> 22:00.558
And, judging by this,
were fairly close associates.

22:00.686 --> 22:03.058
Good. What else?

22:03.188 --> 22:04.857
Nothing.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.601
Nothing?

22:06.734 --> 22:11.976
After 24 hours diligent research,
that is all you have discovered?

22:13.449 --> 22:16.022
Well, do we have an address for this man?

22:16.160 --> 22:17.737
An address...

22:17.870 --> 22:20.824
Damn it all, Tom, where does he live?

22:22.207 --> 22:25.493
- He's through here, sir.
- Thank you very much.

22:25.628 --> 22:29.246
Father? Father,
there's someone to see you.

22:30.924 --> 22:33.250
Inspector Trout.

22:34.261 --> 22:38.175
- From Scotland Yard.
- <i>Detective</i> inspector.

22:42.019 --> 22:44.058
Good evening, sir.

22:46.774 --> 22:51.436
I'm sorry to intrude like this,
but it is a very urgent matter.

22:52.821 --> 22:56.237
I thought you might be
of some assistance to us, sir.

22:56.367 --> 22:57.409
How?

22:58.744 --> 23:00.784
Three men...

23:03.999 --> 23:07.534
Three men in your profession
have all died in the past week

23:07.670 --> 23:09.911
in most unusual circumstances.

23:10.047 --> 23:15.124
Inspector, men in my profession
die every day.

23:15.970 --> 23:19.754
- You have your foot on my pliers.
- I'm sorry.

23:20.641 --> 23:27.011
Do the names Hargreaves, Thornton
and Dunwoody mean anything to you, sir?

24:51.565 --> 24:55.016
- It's hard to believe.
- I'm sure of that, sir.

24:55.152 --> 25:00.194
But can you think of anything at all that
would relate to the killing of these men?

25:00.324 --> 25:03.527
Nothing. Nothing.

25:03.661 --> 25:06.946
Only last week I was talking to Thornton.

25:07.081 --> 25:08.332
Hello?

25:09.625 --> 25:11.701
Yes, he is.

25:11.835 --> 25:13.875
It's for you.

25:17.424 --> 25:19.381
Thank you.

25:21.887 --> 25:23.927
Hello. Trout.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.550
I see. Where's that?

25:30.020 --> 25:32.725
Yes, all right. Ten minutes.

25:33.607 --> 25:36.145
Did you know Dr Longstreet?

25:36.652 --> 25:38.858
You heard a what?!

25:38.988 --> 25:42.688
Well, a violin or a cello or something.

25:42.825 --> 25:46.028
At half past two in the morning, woman?!
In the street?!

25:46.161 --> 25:49.412
Yes. I told you. Don't keep on at me.

25:49.540 --> 25:50.785
I'm sorry.

25:50.916 --> 25:55.459
Like I said, I heard it.
Then there was this car door banging.

25:55.587 --> 26:00.131
I couldn't get off to sleep,
so I came down to find some aspirins.

26:00.259 --> 26:04.257
The door was open a bit
and as I looked through, there he was.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.926
- And then I rang for you lot.
- And that's all?

26:07.057 --> 26:09.264
Well, that's enough for one night.

26:09.393 --> 26:12.928
I mean, look at him.
All white and everything.

26:13.063 --> 26:17.013
There's nothing, except this.
And, uh, that.

26:17.151 --> 26:19.108
Ah, now...

26:19.236 --> 26:21.443
Do you recognise this, madam?

26:22.114 --> 26:24.320
Uh-uh. Fingerprints.

26:25.117 --> 26:28.901
No. It's not mine.
And it's certainly not his.

26:34.627 --> 26:39.372
That's all for now. We'll come back
in the morning and take a full statement.

26:39.506 --> 26:42.591
- Thank you, Mrs?
- Frawley.

26:42.718 --> 26:46.502
He was a nice man.
Good to me, in his own sort of way.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.964
Yeah... You were his...

26:49.516 --> 26:51.592
housekeeper?

26:56.273 --> 27:00.852
Whoever did it must've been a real pro.
He's as dry as a bone.

27:00.986 --> 27:05.316
That <i>is</i> his bone. Poor devil - I bet
he was conscious when it happened.

27:05.449 --> 27:09.114
- Do you think it's the same...
- I don't think any more, Tom.

27:20.089 --> 27:23.292
This is the object in question, sir.

27:24.551 --> 27:27.125
- Dear me, you've broken it.
- What, sir?

27:27.262 --> 27:30.762
It's incredible the amount
of vandalism these days.

27:30.891 --> 27:33.596
I make something like this,
a thing of beauty...

27:33.727 --> 27:35.554
- You did make it?
- Of course.

27:35.688 --> 27:39.436
- I wished to establish that, sir.
- That's my mark on the back.

27:39.566 --> 27:42.236
Can you tell me a little bit about it, sir?

27:42.361 --> 27:46.193
Yes, certainly.
It's one of a very unusual set.

27:46.323 --> 27:50.368
- A set? There's more than one?
- Of course. It's a set.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.985
- How many in the set, sir?
- Ten.

27:53.122 --> 27:55.328
- Ten?!
- Ten.

27:55.457 --> 27:57.415
Were they all the same?

27:57.543 --> 28:02.003
Of course not. Would you want
ten amulets looking exactly the same?

28:02.131 --> 28:04.170
Each had a different symbol.

28:04.300 --> 28:07.550
I see. Well, who ordered the set?

28:07.678 --> 28:10.003
- It was a lady.
- A woman, eh?

28:10.139 --> 28:12.262
No. A lady.

28:12.391 --> 28:17.302
I remember the occasion well. She came
in, gave me a set of working drawings,

28:17.438 --> 28:20.889
she paid half the cost
there and then in cash,

28:21.025 --> 28:23.101
and the other half later.

28:23.235 --> 28:26.153
She was delighted with them -
as well she might be.

28:26.280 --> 28:31.571
That's beautiful craftsmanship, you know.
Could I take another look at it?

28:31.702 --> 28:35.865
One more question, if I might, sir.
What did she look like?

28:35.998 --> 28:41.752
She was a tall... attractive... young lady.

28:42.713 --> 28:45.630
She didn't speak much, as I remember.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.877
- But she was...
- Smart, sir?

28:49.970 --> 28:51.927
Fashionable.

28:52.056 --> 28:53.633
Ah. Yes, sir.

28:53.766 --> 28:56.969
Can you tell me anything else about her?

28:57.102 --> 29:00.602
No, I don't think so. Aren't you going
to write down "fashionable"?

29:00.731 --> 29:02.937
- I think I can remember that.
- Oh, good.

29:03.067 --> 29:08.061
No, she didn't stay very long. And then
there was the money to be counted.

29:08.197 --> 29:09.448
Yes...

29:09.657 --> 29:13.868
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry to take up
so much of your valuable time.

29:13.994 --> 29:16.402
Reasonably valuable, yes.

29:16.538 --> 29:19.742
- Good day, sir.
- Good day, Inspector Pike.

29:21.043 --> 29:23.201
- Trout, sir.
- Yes, of course.

29:25.047 --> 29:27.503
Oh, by the way... Psst, psst...

29:27.633 --> 29:28.676
Sir?

29:29.009 --> 29:32.924
That sign, that mark on the amulet...

29:33.055 --> 29:39.093
I don't know whether this is of any
assistance, but it is, I believe, Hebrew.

29:39.228 --> 29:41.553
Thank you very much, sir.

29:46.110 --> 29:47.308
Hebrew.

29:48.112 --> 29:50.354
This is it, sir.

29:53.575 --> 29:56.327
It's a Hebrew symbol for blood.

29:56.453 --> 29:59.371
- Oh, I see.
- Part of the G'tach.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.167
- The what, sir?
- The G'tach.

30:02.293 --> 30:06.622
The ten curses visited
upon the Pharaohs before Exodus.

30:06.755 --> 30:09.756
- Here, I'll show you.
- Thank you, sir.

30:09.883 --> 30:14.344
They were all ancient maledictions.

30:14.471 --> 30:18.386
Solemn curses, anathemas,

30:18.517 --> 30:22.301
wished upon the Pharaohs
for keeping the Israelites in bondage.

30:22.438 --> 30:24.146
Ah, here it is.

30:24.273 --> 30:28.899
But all this would just be myth,
of course, sir?

30:29.028 --> 30:30.771
- Oh, I think not.
- No?

30:30.904 --> 30:34.985
No. There is little doubt
that the plagues did occur -

30:35.117 --> 30:37.690
though so distant now as to <i>seem</i> a myth.

30:37.828 --> 30:41.197
I see. What form
would the curses take, sir?

30:41.332 --> 30:45.709
Oh, such as the curse of boils, of bats...

30:46.837 --> 30:50.372
- Frogs?
- Frogs, yes. And the curse of blood...

30:50.507 --> 30:52.167
I see, sir, yes...

30:52.301 --> 30:55.670
These ten curses -
would they follow any particular order?

30:55.804 --> 30:59.387
That is a point Talmudic scholars
have debated for generations.

30:59.516 --> 31:04.474
But there is no doubt that the classical
tradition is the curse of boils,

31:04.605 --> 31:11.486
bats, frogs, the curse of blood,
the curse of rats,

31:11.612 --> 31:15.692
hail, of beasts, the locusts of course...

31:15.824 --> 31:18.280
the death of the first-born,

31:18.410 --> 31:21.162
and then, finally, of darkness.

31:21.288 --> 31:23.779
- Darkness, Rabbi?
- Yes.

31:24.875 --> 31:27.200
The final curse upon the land.

31:27.336 --> 31:30.621
<i>To end for ever the sleep of man.</i>

32:11.005 --> 32:14.122
<i> My love...</i>

32:14.227 --> 32:17.006
<i>sweet queen and noble wife,</i>

32:18.095 --> 32:26.055
<i>I alone remain</i>
<i>to bring delivery of your pain.</i>

32:26.979 --> 32:33.432
<i>Severed, my darling,</i>
<i>too quickly from this life</i>

32:33.569 --> 32:38.776
<i>of fires drawn and of memories met.</i>

32:39.617 --> 32:47.280
<i>I shall hold our two hearts again</i>
<i>in single time.</i>

32:50.878 --> 32:54.662
I have prepared a little mathematical
equation for you, Inspector.

32:54.798 --> 32:57.669
These files represent
all of the surgical cases

32:57.801 --> 33:03.555
on which I have served
over a decade - some 1200.

33:03.682 --> 33:06.849
As you know, modern surgery
is all a matter of teamwork,

33:06.977 --> 33:12.398
sometimes involving a dozen or more
people - interns, residents, specialists...

33:12.524 --> 33:13.639
Quite so, sir.

33:13.776 --> 33:19.150
Now, ruling out all the cases
that are over five years old -

33:19.281 --> 33:24.987
the year that Dr Dunwoody, our bat victim,
resumed his practice in London -

33:25.120 --> 33:35.002
that leaves us 37 cases on which I worked
with any two of the four now-dead men.

33:35.130 --> 33:37.918
A scant dozen with three...

33:38.050 --> 33:40.623
but only one...

33:42.096 --> 33:44.302
just one case...

33:47.184 --> 33:50.102
where I worked with all of them.

33:52.982 --> 33:55.520
"Victoria Regina Phi-bes."

33:55.651 --> 33:57.893
I think they called it Phibes.

33:58.028 --> 34:02.275
"Victoria Regina Phibes.
Born November 27th, 1893,

34:02.408 --> 34:07.994
married, no children.
Diagnosis: Immediate radical resection."

34:08.121 --> 34:11.786
- Well, what happened?
- We were too late.

34:12.333 --> 34:15.371
<i>Nine killed you.</i>

34:15.504 --> 34:20.710
<i>Nine shall die,</i>
<i>and be returned your loss.</i>

34:21.342 --> 34:24.297
<i>Nine times nine.</i>

34:24.972 --> 34:27.545
<i>Nine killed you.</i>

34:27.683 --> 34:29.972
<i>Nine shall die.</i>

34:30.476 --> 34:34.974
<i>Nine eternities in doom!</i>

34:35.482 --> 34:38.400
- Very attractive.
- Quite beautiful.

34:38.527 --> 34:41.445
A strange presence, even in death.

34:41.572 --> 34:44.656
- And the husband?
- Dr Anton Phibes.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.618
He was in Switzerland. We cabled him.

34:47.745 --> 34:53.949
But, as he raced back, his car went off
the cliff and he was burned to death.

34:54.083 --> 34:56.206
Are you quite sure of that, sir?

34:56.337 --> 34:58.792
I know it must be
a tempting theory for you,

34:58.922 --> 35:03.549
but they were interred at the same time
in the family vault just outside London.

35:03.677 --> 35:09.383
- Were they fond of each other?
- They seemed so. Completely devoted.

35:09.516 --> 35:12.553
Of course, you realise
what your equation proves.

35:12.686 --> 35:18.559
Some madman has condemned
the whole surgical team for her death.

35:18.692 --> 35:21.812
Everybody in this list here -
including yourself.

35:21.946 --> 35:27.402
Obviously you'll put the remaining people
involved under police protection.

35:28.202 --> 35:32.282
Although, heaven knows, from what?

35:34.166 --> 35:38.116
From the G'tach, sir -
if you know what that is.

35:38.253 --> 35:42.832
Isn't that the... curse of the Pharaohs?

35:42.967 --> 35:46.667
That's right, sir. Someone
is using these ancient biblical curses

35:46.804 --> 35:52.225
to kill everyone associated
with the Phibes operation.

35:52.351 --> 35:58.140
But the husband's dead, there's
no children, so who are we looking for?!

36:44.111 --> 36:47.978
There's a young lady in trouble, Benson.
See if you can help her out.

36:55.831 --> 36:58.666
Hello, what have we got here?

36:59.418 --> 37:02.039
Ah. Needing some help, miss?

38:10.906 --> 38:14.856
Hail, rats, beast, locusts - take your pick.

38:14.994 --> 38:18.279
Or there's death of the first-born,
and darkness.

38:18.414 --> 38:20.323
- Darkness?
- Yes, darkness.

38:20.457 --> 38:22.367
- Coffee.
- Thank you.

38:22.501 --> 38:25.537
On this list of Vesalius',
five people are in danger.

38:25.671 --> 38:29.799
- There's Hedgepath, Kitaj...
- It's pronounced "Kit-eye".

38:29.925 --> 38:33.377
...Whitcombe, the woman Nurse Allen
and Vesalius himself.

38:33.512 --> 38:40.131
I've located everybody else, but so far we
can't find... Kitaj. We think he's in Europe.

38:40.269 --> 38:42.890
What about the Phibes estate
in Switzerland?

38:43.022 --> 38:46.556
The insurance and bank accounts
were closed after his death.

38:46.692 --> 38:48.981
- So his money's still over there?
- No.

38:49.111 --> 38:51.816
Two years ago
the bulk of it was transferred here.

38:51.947 --> 38:54.272
- To whose account?
- I don't know.

38:54.408 --> 38:58.073
But later it was withdrawn
by a woman, in cash.

38:58.203 --> 39:01.786
In fact, the whole estate
was transferred into her name.

39:01.915 --> 39:03.410
A woman.

39:04.293 --> 39:07.460
- Tall, attractive, hardly speaks a word?
- Right.

39:08.631 --> 39:10.872
Now I'm very interested in her.

39:11.884 --> 39:14.422
~ <i>It's a quarter to three</i> ~

39:15.262 --> 39:18.180
~ <i>There's no one in the place</i> ~

39:19.266 --> 39:21.804
~ <i>Except you and me</i> ~

39:24.688 --> 39:28.022
~ <i>So set 'em up, Joe</i> ~

39:29.193 --> 39:31.862
~ <i>I've got a little story</i> ~

39:32.655 --> 39:35.490
~ <i>I think you ought to know</i> ~

39:38.786 --> 39:42.036
~ <i>We're drinking, my friend</i> ~

39:43.207 --> 39:49.210
~ <i>To the end of a brief episode</i> ~

39:51.882 --> 39:55.832
~ <i>So make it one for my baby</i> ~

39:57.221 --> 39:59.628
~ <i>And another one...</i> ~

39:59.765 --> 40:02.517
~ <i>For the road</i> ~

40:08.065 --> 40:12.394
Over here, Inspector.
We found him beside the road, sir.

40:12.528 --> 40:16.193
He's in shock.
You won't get much out of him, poor devil.

40:16.323 --> 40:18.731
- Well, what happened to him?
- Well...

40:18.867 --> 40:22.699
- I see. Is that the car?
- Yes, sir.

40:23.998 --> 40:26.702
We traced the owner.
A man called Hedgepath.

40:26.834 --> 40:30.534
- Dr Hedgepath?
- What's all this?

40:30.671 --> 40:32.829
He's in the back, sir.

40:35.551 --> 40:37.709
It's frozen solid.

41:00.576 --> 41:04.739
A curse of hail.
In the bloody middle of nowhere!

41:04.872 --> 41:06.911
Take a look at this, sir.

41:09.001 --> 41:11.539
He worked it off the motor.

41:11.670 --> 41:16.831
He brought the internal temperature
down to at least 100Â° below zero.

41:22.973 --> 41:27.635
- Mercifully, he didn't feel much, sir.
- Like hell he didn't.

41:47.623 --> 41:48.874
Check.

41:51.251 --> 41:54.502
- Check.
- Huh? Oh.

41:55.172 --> 41:58.422
Well done. Go up to bed.

42:00.094 --> 42:03.676
It's not mate, father.
You can still move.

42:04.932 --> 42:08.597
Oh, well, we'll finish tomorrow, Lem.

42:08.727 --> 42:10.684
Up you go.

42:12.773 --> 42:17.482
- You wouldn't like to hear some...
- I'm not very good company tonight.

42:17.611 --> 42:22.569
I must play to you tomorrow. Old Darrow
put me onto it. It's a super piece.

42:22.700 --> 42:23.898
Darrow.

42:24.034 --> 42:26.739
You know, the chap at the music shop.

42:26.870 --> 42:30.868
I always thought he was a bore,
but what a fantastic memory he's got.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.455
Get him talking
about the great organists...

42:33.585 --> 42:36.290
Bridges, Drew and Phibes,
he knew 'em all.

42:36.422 --> 42:38.379
Anyway, 'night, Dad.

42:38.507 --> 42:40.298
Good night.

43:04.408 --> 43:06.493
Mr Darrow.

43:07.328 --> 43:10.163
Mr Darrow, did you know this man?

43:15.669 --> 43:20.212
Excuse me, Mr Darrow?
Did you know this man?

43:23.385 --> 43:25.262
Sixpence.

43:25.804 --> 43:29.884
Yes, but did you know him?

43:41.820 --> 43:46.067
- God knows what the old chap meant.
- He couldn't tell you anything else?

43:46.200 --> 43:52.320
He kept insisting in his strange way
that Phibes has been his patron for years.

43:52.456 --> 43:54.449
And still is.

43:54.583 --> 43:59.625
- He didn't tell you what he looks like?
- Oh, he's blind as a...

43:59.755 --> 44:02.672
Well, he can hardly see at all.

44:02.800 --> 44:08.138
There's something I very much want
to have a look at. May I use your phone?

44:11.725 --> 44:16.434
- What do you expect to find here?
- We've drawn a blank everywhere else.

44:16.563 --> 44:18.936
Fools. Fools!

44:19.066 --> 44:21.438
They'll have the worms soon enough.

44:24.697 --> 44:27.448
What happened
to the Phibes estate?

44:27.574 --> 44:29.448
That's complicated, sir.

44:29.576 --> 44:34.867
It seems he had money invested
all over Europe. We're still investigating.

44:34.999 --> 44:38.414
- Where did he get all those degrees?
- That I can tell you.

44:38.544 --> 44:42.162
He took a degree in music
in Germany at Heidel...

44:42.298 --> 44:43.335
...berg.

44:43.439 --> 44:46.543
- And another one in Paris at the...
- Sorbonne?

44:46.677 --> 44:51.422
Yes. Now that was a PhD in theology.

44:51.557 --> 44:57.227
Theology? That rather neatly explains
his knowledge of the Old Testament.

44:57.354 --> 44:58.979
The G'tach, sir.

45:56.455 --> 45:58.661
Open up, please.

46:20.229 --> 46:23.894
Does anyone ever visit this place?

46:24.024 --> 46:26.313
Well, someone has.

46:29.989 --> 46:32.112
Are you sure that...

46:39.999 --> 46:42.953
Well, here he is. Anton Phibes.

46:43.085 --> 46:45.161
Right next to his wife.

46:46.213 --> 46:48.455
Let's take a look.

46:54.054 --> 46:56.889
- Notice that smell.
- Roses?

46:57.016 --> 47:00.467
- More like formaldehyde.
- Mind your fingers.

47:02.938 --> 47:04.607
Careful.

47:10.946 --> 47:16.107
There. Ashes. Anton Phibes.
Now are you satisfied?

47:16.619 --> 47:19.489
Well, I'm not sure that I am really, sir.

47:20.331 --> 47:25.621
Think. All this proves is that somebody
was incinerated in that car crash.

47:25.753 --> 47:28.837
- The Swiss police told us that.
- Exactly.

47:28.964 --> 47:35.085
But suppose that <i>somebody</i>
was not Phibes at all, but his chauffeur.

47:36.013 --> 47:40.889
- And Phibes is back in London?
- Just like the old man told you.

47:42.311 --> 47:47.139
She was not incinerated.
Let's have a look at her.

48:15.844 --> 48:22.612
<i>My love, my sweet queen...</i>

48:22.716 --> 48:25.175
<i>my noble wife,</i>

48:26.063 --> 48:32.433
<i>severed too quickly, too cruelly</i>
<i>from this life.</i>

48:33.362 --> 48:41.571
<i>I remain and suffer</i>
<i>to bring delivery of your pain,</i>

48:42.496 --> 48:48.166
<i>of fires drawn and of memories met.</i>

48:49.211 --> 48:57.753
<i>Soon we shall hold our two</i>
<i>precious hearts in single time.</i>

49:09.898 --> 49:13.314
This one here, Kitaj,
or however you pronounce it...

49:13.444 --> 49:15.567
Schenley's on his way down there?

49:15.696 --> 49:18.104
Crow! I've been looking for you.

49:18.240 --> 49:22.024
This is most unsettling. Thank God
the press haven't picked up on it.

49:22.161 --> 49:26.906
- We've managed to withhold most...
- But if the press do get hold of this...

49:27.041 --> 49:31.584
- We'd have a disaster on our hands.
- What the hell d'you think we've got now?

49:31.712 --> 49:34.879
If we're not careful,
there'll be questions in the House.

49:35.007 --> 49:37.545
This whole thing's a political time bomb.

49:37.676 --> 49:40.796
We're all of us as vulnerable as hell.
Especially me.

49:40.929 --> 49:44.797
- My men are working as hard as they can.
- Not hard enough! Come with me.

49:44.933 --> 49:47.306
- And you... What's your name?
- Trout, sir.

49:47.436 --> 49:50.722
Trout. Why are you standing there?
Where's your jacket?

49:50.856 --> 49:56.099
Get out there! There's a madman out there
and I want him brought in! Now!

50:44.952 --> 50:47.407
- All right, Harry?
- OK.

51:02.344 --> 51:06.342
- OK, Dr Kitaj, brakes on.
- Brakes on.

51:06.473 --> 51:08.964
- Throttle closed.
- Throttle closed.

51:09.101 --> 51:11.557
- Switches off.
- Switches off.

51:14.315 --> 51:17.315
- Throttle set.
- Throttle set.

51:17.443 --> 51:20.147
- Contact.
- Contact.

52:36.647 --> 52:37.898
Yup...

52:59.086 --> 53:00.129
Agh!

54:29.510 --> 54:32.131
- You should've driven faster!
- Faster?!

54:32.262 --> 54:36.343
- I got there before the locals.
- Yeah, but after the crash.

54:36.475 --> 54:41.517
I was going over 90mph. I thought
the damn thing was going to explode.

54:41.647 --> 54:44.564
- Whose car is it, by the way?
- God knows.

54:44.692 --> 54:47.895
I got the call about Kitaj
and got the fastest car I could see.

54:48.028 --> 54:49.902
But it is one of ours?

54:50.030 --> 54:53.980
It must be.
There's a police book in the front.

54:54.118 --> 54:58.115
Needs a good service now, though.
A couple of the oil seals have gone.

54:58.247 --> 55:01.532
- Hey, you! What's-your-name, Pike!
- Trout, sir.

55:01.667 --> 55:04.122
Why has my car been moved?

55:04.753 --> 55:05.796
Yes...

55:05.921 --> 55:08.128
- Is it your car, sir?
- Of course it is!

55:08.257 --> 55:11.792
It's not to be moved at all,
not even pushed. Understand?

55:11.927 --> 55:14.964
- Perfectly, sir.
- The engine's not run in yet.

55:15.097 --> 55:17.553
Have we located this fellow Kitaj yet?

55:17.683 --> 55:20.055
Pronounced "Kit-eye", sir.

55:20.185 --> 55:23.305
Well, I wanted to talk to you about him.
You see...

55:23.439 --> 55:28.266
I'll expect your report in the morning.
I can't wait now.

55:28.402 --> 55:32.151
I say, any more news
on this fellow Pheebes?

55:32.281 --> 55:33.989
Phibes, sir.

55:34.116 --> 55:37.900
Are you in the habit
of contradicting your superiors, Bream?

55:38.037 --> 55:39.946
We are onto him, sir.

55:40.080 --> 55:44.493
Where are you concentrating the search?
Where was he last seen?

55:44.627 --> 55:47.663
- Highgate, sir.
- Highgate. Good. Whereabouts?

55:47.796 --> 55:50.169
- The cemetery, sir.
- The cemetery?

55:50.299 --> 55:54.427
- Yes, sir. That's where he's buried.
- Good. Well done, Perch.

57:37.281 --> 57:41.575
- And this nurse?
- Nurse Allen. I've got men at the hospital.

57:41.702 --> 57:43.825
- Vesalius?
- He's covered too.

57:43.954 --> 57:47.121
- That just leaves that fellow...
- Dr Whitcombe.

57:47.249 --> 57:50.748
We're taking him to the country
for a few days, if he'll come.

57:50.878 --> 57:52.502
<i>If</i> he'll come?

57:52.630 --> 57:54.836
I appreciate your concern, Sergeant,

57:54.965 --> 57:58.963
but I owe it to my patients
to be back in London within the week.

57:59.094 --> 58:03.507
Of course, Doctor. I guarantee we'll
have you back within a few days.

58:03.641 --> 58:05.384
Inspector Trout, sir.

58:05.517 --> 58:08.851
I must say,
I feel rather like a head of state!

58:29.166 --> 58:35.204
Right, now careful, son.
Easy does it. I think it's a left-hand thread.

58:35.339 --> 58:37.166
Yes, it is.

58:37.925 --> 58:38.968
Shh.

58:45.349 --> 58:47.674
It's coming...

58:48.227 --> 58:51.643
Gentlemen, can't we have
a little quiet in this club?

59:33.230 --> 59:35.524
It's brass!

59:36.025 --> 59:39.191
He's cast the thing in bloody brass!

59:39.320 --> 59:42.902
It appears to have been fired
by a catapult, sir.

59:43.032 --> 59:44.407
Oh, brilliant.

59:57.379 --> 01:00:04.177
<i> Where can we find</i>
<i>two better hemispheres...</i>

01:00:04.887 --> 01:00:08.303
<i>without sharp north,</i>

01:00:08.432 --> 01:00:11.766
<i>without declining west?</i>

01:00:12.853 --> 01:00:18.077
<i>My face in thine eye,</i>

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:21.184
<i>thine in mine appears...</i>

01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:25.647
<i>and true, plain hearts...</i>

01:00:25.783 --> 01:00:31.622
<i>do in the faces rest.</i>

01:00:35.417 --> 01:00:41.705
<i>Within 24 hours my work will be finished.</i>

01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:50.717
<i>And then, my precious jewel,</i>
<i>I will join you in your setting.</i>

01:00:51.809 --> 01:00:57.514
<i>We shall be reunited for ever</i>

01:00:57.648 --> 01:01:03.935
<i>in a secluded corner</i>
<i>of the great Elysian field...</i>

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:08.481
<i>of the beautiful beyond.</i>

01:01:12.746 --> 01:01:17.242
70 men are on this case, trying to find
a man who, according to you, is buried.

01:01:17.376 --> 01:01:21.623
- One of Trout's theories, sir.
- Theories? Trout's <i>practice</i> concerns me!

01:01:21.755 --> 01:01:23.795
- I'm talking about you.
- Sir?

01:01:23.924 --> 01:01:26.462
It seems that with immaculate precision

01:01:26.593 --> 01:01:30.591
you've been arriving on the scene
just after the victim's death.

01:01:30.723 --> 01:01:34.174
This time, due no doubt
to an organisational oversight,

01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:36.551
you arrived before the crime.

01:01:36.687 --> 01:01:42.061
But, as I've come to expect, that made
little difference. It was still committed.

01:01:42.192 --> 01:01:46.142
A brass unicorn has been catapulted
across a London street

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:51.321
and impaled an eminent surgeon.
Words fail me, gentlemen.

01:01:51.452 --> 01:01:53.610
- Excuse me.
- Where are you off to now?

01:01:53.746 --> 01:01:56.118
- The lavatory.
- Highly appropriate.

01:03:04.149 --> 01:03:08.443
- Evening, Constable. Everything normal?
- Nothing to report, sir.

01:03:25.504 --> 01:03:30.249
The whole place is completely sealed.
It's as simple as that.

01:03:30.384 --> 01:03:36.303
"Simplicity" isn't exactly the word I'd use
in dealing with this man, Inspector.

01:03:36.432 --> 01:03:41.307
I've got half the Yard, plus some of the
local boys, and a small mobile unit here.

01:03:41.437 --> 01:03:46.597
I've got cars all round the place,
and, of course, some plain-clothes men.

01:03:46.734 --> 01:03:51.775
So, unless he drops in on us
from above in a balloon -

01:03:51.905 --> 01:03:53.898
which I wouldn't put past him -

01:03:54.033 --> 01:03:56.072
she should be safe.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:01.997
Supposing... he's in the building already?

01:04:02.124 --> 01:04:07.794
I hope he is. Cos if he's in,
he can't get out and we've got him.

01:04:08.631 --> 01:04:14.965
After all, he has killed seven people
in the last 14 days.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.673
- Dr Vesalius.
- Ah.

01:04:18.807 --> 01:04:22.591
What are you doing here? You're not
involved in this charade, I hope?

01:04:22.728 --> 01:04:24.851
I am afraid I am, Nurse.

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:27.981
These men have told me
I must not leave the hospital.

01:04:28.108 --> 01:04:32.236
- For your own...
- Why me? Just what is going on here?

01:04:32.363 --> 01:04:35.399
Please, go to your room.
We'll have your supper sent up.

01:04:35.532 --> 01:04:39.779
- I've already eaten. Now...
- Inspector Trout is doing his best.

01:04:39.912 --> 01:04:43.956
Please, you must go to your room
and stay there for at least 24 hours.

01:04:44.083 --> 01:04:48.330
Don't say a word, please.
I know just what your feelings are.

01:04:48.462 --> 01:04:51.629
The police have reason to believe...

01:05:07.481 --> 01:05:10.932
What do the police
have reason to believe, Doctor?

01:05:11.068 --> 01:05:14.686
Do you remember assisting me
in an operation four years ago?

01:05:14.822 --> 01:05:15.859
Yes.

01:05:15.963 --> 01:05:22.401
In connection with that, the police
believe a man is going to try to kill you.

01:05:22.538 --> 01:05:25.907
- Kill me?!
- Yes. Within a few hours.

01:05:27.668 --> 01:05:29.744
I'm sorry.

01:05:32.506 --> 01:05:35.957
I don't know how you expect me
to sleep with this going on.

01:05:36.093 --> 01:05:38.928
I suggest you take a sleeping pill.

01:05:39.054 --> 01:05:41.510
- Good night.
- Good night!

01:07:00.886 --> 01:07:06.307
There is one aspect of this situation
we have not yet explored.

01:07:06.433 --> 01:07:08.141
Oh, don't worry, sir.

01:07:08.268 --> 01:07:12.313
Sooner or later he'll get stopped
by the oldest snag of all: Human error.

01:07:12.439 --> 01:07:15.974
- Human error won't stop him.
- Why? What do you mean?

01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:21.104
He's had years to hide,
to plot this damnable thing.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.985
He's compelling himself to follow exactly
the classic death pattern of the G'tach.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:30.414
It's a psychic force that holds the man
together, this maniacal precision.

01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:33.874
If we could just throw it off,
interrupt the cycle...

01:07:34.003 --> 01:07:38.332
then he might be stopped -
by his own inflexible standards.

01:10:33.057 --> 01:10:35.345
Three curses left.

01:10:36.352 --> 01:10:37.603
Yes...

01:10:38.103 --> 01:10:42.646
Of course, the thought does occur,
if you'll pardon the liberty,

01:10:42.775 --> 01:10:44.767
that it could be your turn tonight.

01:10:44.902 --> 01:10:46.894
I've considered that.

01:10:47.029 --> 01:10:52.865
I have a feeling that I'll be last.
After all, I was chief surgeon on the case.

01:10:52.993 --> 01:10:56.611
If he keeps to the pattern,
it should be the darkness for you.

01:10:56.747 --> 01:10:59.499
Though heaven knows what that could be.

01:10:59.625 --> 01:11:03.670
Have you considered
the death of the first-born, sir?

01:11:03.796 --> 01:11:06.168
The fact that my older brother is dead

01:11:06.298 --> 01:11:10.248
should surely exclude me
from that particular curse.

01:11:10.386 --> 01:11:15.380
Well, I am going to remain by your side
until we apprehend this man.

01:11:15.516 --> 01:11:18.267
- Thank you.
- Not at all, sir. It...

01:11:18.769 --> 01:11:20.927
What about <i>your</i> first-born?!

01:11:21.063 --> 01:11:27.433
Schenley! Take the doctor home, put a
guard on his house and report back here.

01:11:27.569 --> 01:11:30.523
The sergeant will take you, sir.

01:12:25.002 --> 01:12:27.872
The back door was hanging off.
Lock had been forced.

01:12:28.005 --> 01:12:32.003
A struggle upstairs, by the look of it.
The lad's been taken all right.

01:12:32.134 --> 01:12:36.262
Stay here with Vesalius.
I'll get back to Trout.

01:12:39.058 --> 01:12:40.552
Poor little devil.

01:12:55.199 --> 01:12:58.532
- The boy's gone.
- Oh, no! Any sign of Phibes?

01:12:58.661 --> 01:13:00.071
None at all.

01:13:00.204 --> 01:13:02.576
We'll check Nurse Allen
and get over there.

01:13:02.706 --> 01:13:06.289
- How's he taking it?
- Vesalius? You can imagine.

01:13:23.227 --> 01:13:25.634
Open it. Slowly.

01:14:05.519 --> 01:14:11.744
<i>Soon, Victoria, soon...</i>

01:14:11.848 --> 01:14:16.064
<i>but one world to possess,</i>

01:14:17.114 --> 01:14:21.064
<i>there to love and sleep again...</i>

01:14:21.952 --> 01:14:27.706
<i>in our own eternal paradise.</i>

01:14:35.466 --> 01:14:38.550
We're doing everything we can, sir.

01:14:41.096 --> 01:14:43.136
Perhaps a brandy might help.

01:14:57.529 --> 01:15:00.815
There must've been some way
I could have prevented this.

01:15:05.746 --> 01:15:06.997
Hello?

01:15:10.417 --> 01:15:12.244
Who's there?

01:15:29.937 --> 01:15:32.606
<i>Nine killed her.</i>

01:15:33.274 --> 01:15:37.538
<i>Nine shall die.</i>

01:15:37.642 --> 01:15:39.063
Is that you, Phibes?

01:15:39.196 --> 01:15:41.355
Phibes? Phibes?

01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:44.491
<i>Eight have died.</i>

01:15:45.286 --> 01:15:49.550
<i>Soon to be nine.</i>

01:15:49.654 --> 01:15:55.369
<i>Nine eternities in doom.</i>

01:15:55.473 --> 01:15:57.875
Phibes, I must see you.

01:15:59.091 --> 01:16:02.626
Where are you, Phibes? I must speak...

01:16:02.761 --> 01:16:04.968
Phibes, where is my son?!

01:16:05.931 --> 01:16:10.677
<i>The organ plays till midnight.</i>

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.941
<i>The large house in Maldine Square.</i>

01:16:17.943 --> 01:16:20.185
<i>Come alone.</i>

01:16:26.702 --> 01:16:30.201
I'm going alone.
Perhaps he'll trade my life for my son's.

01:16:30.331 --> 01:16:35.325
If you think you can reason with him,
you're as mad as he is! We're coming too.

01:16:35.461 --> 01:16:40.882
Your men's presence there could
only accelerate the death of my son!

01:16:41.008 --> 01:16:43.214
Sorry, I cannot allow you to go alone.

01:16:43.344 --> 01:16:46.428
- My son's life is at stake!
- We'll take every precaution,

01:16:46.555 --> 01:16:48.548
but I cannot allow you to go alone.

01:16:48.682 --> 01:16:53.510
I am prepared to use force if necessary!
I'm sorry, but you are my responsibility.

01:16:53.646 --> 01:16:56.397
All right, Trout.
I'll do whatever you say.

01:16:56.523 --> 01:16:59.524
At least there's time
to make a telephone call, I hope.

01:16:59.652 --> 01:17:01.810
If you're quick, sir, yes.

01:17:01.946 --> 01:17:03.570
Your brandy.

01:17:08.827 --> 01:17:11.034
I'm sorry too, Trout.

01:18:42.171 --> 01:18:45.456
<i>Good evening, Dr Vesalius.</i>

01:18:45.591 --> 01:18:48.212
I have come for my son.

01:18:48.344 --> 01:18:50.716
<i>He will die at midnight.</i>

01:18:50.846 --> 01:18:53.598
If you must take a life, take mine.

01:18:53.724 --> 01:19:00.605
<i>I will have killed nine times in my life,</i>
<i>Dr Vesalius.</i>

01:19:00.731 --> 01:19:04.681
<i>How many murders</i>
<i>can be attributed to you?</i>

01:19:04.818 --> 01:19:08.768
- None. I did not kill your wife.
- <i>No?</i>

01:19:08.906 --> 01:19:10.945
I tried to save her.

01:19:11.075 --> 01:19:17.908
<i>With a knife in your hand?</i>
<i>Doctor, I have no faith in your profession.</i>

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:23.746
<i>I was told after my crash</i>
<i>that I would never speak again.</i>

01:19:23.879 --> 01:19:27.213
<i>The doctors were, of course, wrong.</i>

01:19:27.341 --> 01:19:34.174
<i>For, as you see and can hear, I have used</i>
<i>my knowledge of music and acoustics</i>

01:19:34.306 --> 01:19:36.678
<i>to re-create my voice.</i>

01:19:36.809 --> 01:19:41.138
You don't have to remind me
of your ingenuity, Dr Phibes.

01:19:41.272 --> 01:19:43.560
Where, where is my son?

01:19:43.691 --> 01:19:48.399
<i>May I give you one final reminder,</i>
<i>Dr Vesalius?</i>

01:19:49.238 --> 01:19:52.821
<i>You will see your son</i>
<i>under circumstances</i>

01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:58.027
<i>which may bring back memories to you.</i>

01:20:04.712 --> 01:20:10.964
- What is it you want?
- <i>The skill of your hands, Doctor.</i>

01:20:11.885 --> 01:20:19.098
<i>I am giving your son</i>
<i>the same chance that my wife had.</i>

01:20:19.893 --> 01:20:23.725
<i>You need not be alarmed.</i>

01:20:23.856 --> 01:20:28.233
<i>He has already been anaesthetised.</i>

01:20:31.614 --> 01:20:35.196
Your wife, no, Phibes.
But you I <i>will</i> kill.

01:20:35.326 --> 01:20:37.817
<i>But you can't, Doctor.</i>

01:20:38.746 --> 01:20:42.364
<i>I am already dead.</i>

01:20:43.917 --> 01:20:46.373
<i>Your son needs you.</i>

01:21:25.292 --> 01:21:26.834
Sergeant!

01:21:38.764 --> 01:21:42.975
<i>Are you receiving me, Vesalius?</i>

01:21:43.519 --> 01:21:47.931
<i>That is an x-ray of your son's ribcage.</i>

01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:55.186
<i>You will see from it that a tiny key</i>
<i>has been lodged close to his heart.</i>

01:21:55.864 --> 01:22:03.694
<i>It will unlock the halter around</i>
<i>your son's neck and will free the trolley.</i>

01:22:04.665 --> 01:22:10.703
<i>If you are wondering</i>
<i>why you need to free the operating table,</i>

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:17.465
<i>then I suggest</i>
<i>you look above his head, Doctor.</i>

01:22:18.637 --> 01:22:24.592
<i>In a few moments,</i>
<i>acid will be released into that tube.</i>

01:22:24.727 --> 01:22:27.930
<i>It will creep down...</i>

01:22:28.063 --> 01:22:31.349
<i>slowly, inexorably.</i>

01:22:32.192 --> 01:22:39.322
<i>It will take six minutes</i>
<i>to reach the outlet over his face.</i>

01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:44.527
<i>Exactly six minutes, Doctor.</i>

01:23:13.025 --> 01:23:15.064
Please hurry.

01:24:02.574 --> 01:24:04.781
For God's sake!

01:24:05.786 --> 01:24:10.495
<i>Don't cry upon God, Dr Vesalius.</i>

01:24:10.624 --> 01:24:12.783
<i>He is on my side!</i>

01:24:13.585 --> 01:24:19.291
<i>He led me, showed me the way</i>
<i>in my quest for vengeance.</i>

01:24:19.425 --> 01:24:23.672
<i>Not God, Doctor. Look to yourself.</i>

01:24:23.804 --> 01:24:28.300
<i>Those hands,</i>
<i>those skilled hands of yours.</i>

01:24:28.434 --> 01:24:32.016
<i>You can be his only salvation.</i>

01:24:32.146 --> 01:24:35.312
<i>Look above your son, Doctor.</i>

01:24:37.276 --> 01:24:42.353
<i>Vulnavia, my work is nearly finished.</i>

01:24:42.489 --> 01:24:46.570
<i>Go now, destroy all I have created.</i>

01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:52.498
<i>Work faster, Doctor.</i>
<i>The acid is descending.</i>

01:24:53.584 --> 01:24:59.622
<i>My wife existed only six minutes</i>
<i>on the operating table,</i>

01:24:59.757 --> 01:25:02.508
<i>and then she was dead.</i>

01:25:03.302 --> 01:25:05.793
- <i>You murdered her.</i>
- No!

01:25:05.929 --> 01:25:08.136
<i>Murdered her!</i>

01:25:08.265 --> 01:25:13.260
<i>But he will have what she did not..</i>
<i>A second chance.</i>

01:25:33.207 --> 01:25:39.541
<i>Perhaps your hands will shake</i>
<i>and he too will die under your knife.</i>

01:25:40.214 --> 01:25:43.713
<i>A few remaining minutes are all you have.</i>

01:25:44.718 --> 01:25:49.546
<i>Because, when the acid reaches him,</i>

01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:54.601
<i>he will have a face like mine.</i>

01:27:13.807 --> 01:27:16.049
Follow me, men.

01:28:07.194 --> 01:28:10.230
- Vesalius! Is the boy all right?
- Yes.

01:28:27.798 --> 01:28:30.289
Turn that damn thing off!

01:28:33.387 --> 01:28:37.598
- We'll need an ambulance for Lem.
- What about?

01:28:45.691 --> 01:28:48.894
Right, you two get downstairs
and bring that boy up here.

01:28:49.028 --> 01:28:53.571
The rest of you, keep searching the
house. We have got to find Phibes.

01:28:53.699 --> 01:28:56.155
Where the hell is he?!

01:29:25.814 --> 01:29:29.942
- Where the devil did this come from?
- What comes up must go down.

01:29:30.069 --> 01:29:31.527
Brilliant.

01:29:31.654 --> 01:29:35.319
No, don't touch it, sir.
Much better leave it to us.

01:29:35.449 --> 01:29:38.320
You never know, it could be a trap.

01:32:21.198 --> 01:32:23.689
He's gone. Vanished.

01:32:23.826 --> 01:32:26.114
That's bloody impossible.

01:32:26.245 --> 01:32:29.448
That still leaves the final curse.

01:32:29.581 --> 01:32:31.206
Darkness.

01:32:31.333 --> 01:32:33.789
Well, he'll be working on it.

01:32:35.045 --> 01:32:37.085
Wherever he is.
