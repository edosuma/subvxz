02:57.559 --> 03:04.190
Ampipe Bulldogs. Ampipe Bulldogs.
Ampipe Bulldogs.

03:04.774 --> 03:06.818
Ampipe.

04:00.038 --> 04:01.873
- Bye, Pop.
- Morning, Stefen.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.833
Greg.

04:26.773 --> 04:29.108
- Stef, we gonna beat Walnut Heights?
- You know it.

04:29.275 --> 04:30.610
All right! Get in.

05:09.107 --> 05:12.068
Hurry up.
Hey, wait up.

05:12.235 --> 05:14.487
There you go.

05:18.491 --> 05:21.786
The Stinger!
- You take good care of Charlotte?

05:21.953 --> 05:25.123
- She's my freak of the week.
- Shadow, damn you!

05:25.289 --> 05:27.917
You know when people die
and they donate stuff?

05:28.126 --> 05:31.671
Well, I'm gonna donate
my dick to Charlotte.

05:34.549 --> 05:40.138
Here comes my nervous breakdown.
I'll see you guys later. Take care.

05:48.062 --> 05:52.859
- Why is what's-her-name crying?
- Her and her boyfriend are breaking up.

05:53.025 --> 05:58.489
I bet I know why. I mean most guys
aren't as understanding as I am, Lisa.

05:58.656 --> 06:01.743
I know that, Stef.

06:01.909 --> 06:06.706
- What did you do? Swim to school?
- Yeah, my chauffeur was a little late.

06:08.708 --> 06:10.710
- Stefo.
Hey, Tracy.

06:10.877 --> 06:14.964
- You got my English?
I got your English right here.

06:15.173 --> 06:18.217
You want your English?
You want his English?

06:18.384 --> 06:20.052
- No?
Come on.

06:20.219 --> 06:24.640
- I'm not sure about 20 and 21.
- How do you know football stuff...

06:24.807 --> 06:26.893
...and not know how to conjugate a verb?

06:27.059 --> 06:28.978
- What's a verb?
- What's a hand-on?

06:29.145 --> 06:32.398
- What's a hand-on?
- I taught you Saturday night.

06:32.565 --> 06:34.442
Stef!

06:35.401 --> 06:37.278
- Come on.
See you at lunch.

06:37.445 --> 06:38.905
Yeah, you buy, right?

06:40.781 --> 06:43.159
Tracy, come on.

06:43.326 --> 06:46.496
Tracy, come on. Come on.

06:46.829 --> 06:49.582
All right, brain pump.

06:53.794 --> 06:58.049
Harry.
- Hey, brothers.

06:59.342 --> 07:01.636
Give me a break, man.

07:22.031 --> 07:23.699
- Vinnie.

07:23.866 --> 07:27.620
She keeps looking back here. Do it.

07:27.787 --> 07:29.247
- No way.
- Come on.

07:29.413 --> 07:31.165
No.

07:31.958 --> 07:34.710
- Come on.
- No.

07:34.877 --> 07:38.339
- Guinea.
- Okay.

08:30.808 --> 08:33.436
Vucci. Vucci. Vinnie!

08:46.532 --> 08:50.119
You got something to share
with us, Mr. Salvucci?

08:50.286 --> 08:54.749
- Can I leave the room?
Yeah, I think you'd better.

09:12.433 --> 09:15.186
Don't tell me that hurt.
- Yes, it hurt.

09:15.352 --> 09:18.272
You ruined my chances
for a scholarship.

09:18.439 --> 09:20.691
Have you heard
from any recruiters?

09:20.858 --> 09:24.862
You know the reason I'm playing
is because Prazowicz is hurt.

09:25.029 --> 09:28.157
- You still got a shot.
- Right, for welfare.

09:35.790 --> 09:37.792
Stef?

09:39.210 --> 09:43.130
Stef? Are you in here?

09:43.839 --> 09:45.591
Stef?

09:48.844 --> 09:50.888
Stef?

09:51.889 --> 09:53.516
I got the lunch.

09:55.976 --> 09:57.436
You are my lunch.

10:02.107 --> 10:06.278
Scared you, Lietzke?
- No.

10:07.238 --> 10:12.326
- Next time, you go. I almost got busted.
- You want me to get busted?

10:12.535 --> 10:16.789
No one's gonna put you on report
the week of the Walnut Heights game.

10:16.956 --> 10:20.167
Yeah, Walnut Heights, huh?

10:20.626 --> 10:24.046
There's gonna be recruiters
from every college.

10:24.630 --> 10:29.426
All to see Stefen Djordjevic.

10:29.593 --> 10:32.680
Only it's no joke.

10:32.846 --> 10:35.683
Walnut Heights have the best
halfback in the state.

10:35.849 --> 10:39.603
I knock him on his ass,
I'll have my pick of colleges.

10:39.770 --> 10:42.314
You pick one near home, huh.

10:46.026 --> 10:48.654
Yeah, I'd like to.

10:48.821 --> 10:51.448
This is my shot.

10:51.615 --> 10:55.286
This is my way out Friday night.

10:56.996 --> 11:03.043
And I gotta go to the best school,
with the best engineering program.

11:06.964 --> 11:11.010
Djordjevices have been humping
steel out of this town for years.

11:11.218 --> 11:15.180
You know, Grandpa, Pop, Greg.

11:15.347 --> 11:18.684
I mean, you know,
it's about time one of us...

11:18.851 --> 11:23.439
...had something to say
about the stuff after it's been made.

11:23.772 --> 11:26.525
And it's gonna be me.

11:31.613 --> 11:34.283
- You're making fun. You're laughing.
- No.

11:34.450 --> 11:36.660
- Yes, you are.

11:37.202 --> 11:38.454
Those fries are terrible.

11:41.290 --> 11:43.125
Is someone in here?

11:44.334 --> 11:47.504
Is it you, Salvucci?

11:47.755 --> 11:50.049
If it is, you're in bad trouble.

11:56.221 --> 11:59.516
- The University of Southern Cal.
- Bullshit.

11:59.683 --> 12:04.063
No, no bullshit. A full fucking ride, man!

12:04.229 --> 12:08.067
- We're getting out of here, buddy.
I know. Shit!

12:09.109 --> 12:14.323
Excuse me, ladies. Brian Riley
is going to SC, motherfuckers!

12:14.531 --> 12:16.283
All right.

12:16.492 --> 12:19.244
All I gotta do is maintain
my 2.0 average-

12:19.411 --> 12:23.040
- You can do that if you cheat.
- Bonehead is going to Hollywood.

12:23.248 --> 12:27.419
- Maybe you better take us with you.
- We make you look good.

12:27.628 --> 12:30.464
I don't have to shovel
any more damn snow.

12:30.672 --> 12:34.259
You might not shovel snow,
but you will shovel earthquakes.

12:34.468 --> 12:39.306
I'll be playing in the Rose Bowl.
You guys will watch me on TV.

12:39.515 --> 12:43.560
You going to Hollywood,
you're gonna have to learn to dress.

12:43.769 --> 12:47.856
- And dance.
- That's right. You gotta be cool, man.

12:48.065 --> 12:51.527
One, two. Come on.
Come on, man, come on. One...

12:52.069 --> 12:56.615
- Shake it out, Bri.
Hey, Fox, show me how to do that.

13:04.122 --> 13:08.669
Okay, now you've got
to be gliding. Come on.

13:08.877 --> 13:12.005
Move your hands
just like you're a puppet.

13:13.298 --> 13:16.343
- This shit comes in handy.
You know it.

13:16.760 --> 13:21.265
Mouse, wake up and check this out.
Not bad for a white boy, eh?

13:21.473 --> 13:24.935
You look horrible. No wonder
you get beat on defense.

13:25.143 --> 13:28.438
Yeah? Who's wearing the letter, pal?

13:29.314 --> 13:33.360
Bri, you ain't never gonna be
one of them exotic dancers.

13:35.571 --> 13:38.240
It's a good thing.

13:38.448 --> 13:41.535
- Don't give her too much now.
- Yeah. Charlotte.

13:41.702 --> 13:45.872
- Charlotte?
- Just tease it, Charlotte.

13:53.171 --> 13:54.756
Ladies!

13:58.051 --> 13:59.428
Five minutes.

14:08.645 --> 14:13.525
Look, I've been up all night.
I want you to take a look at this.

14:13.692 --> 14:16.570
If we play straight,
they're gonna blow us out.

14:16.737 --> 14:21.366
But if we force them to pass,
we can take away the edge they got.

14:21.533 --> 14:24.911
We'll put our linemen a yard
and a half off the ball.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.789
- 62 stack?
- Yeah. Submarine every play.

14:27.956 --> 14:31.168
- Goal line defense the entire game?
- Yeah.

14:31.335 --> 14:34.171
When Alexander comes up,
all he's gonna find is people.

14:34.338 --> 14:38.133
- What if he tries to break around end?
- We got our linebackers.

14:38.300 --> 14:41.720
- If they pass, we're too quick.
- Nobody's ever tried it.

14:42.971 --> 14:47.601
If it works, we're geniuses.
If it doesn't, what've we got to lose?

14:47.809 --> 14:50.312
Our lives.

14:51.313 --> 14:54.983
Right. So let's make it work, Jess.

14:55.192 --> 14:59.279
I want you to attack the legs
of the man in front of you.

14:59.446 --> 15:02.574
Get your ass up, Nicatancous.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.452
- Get down! Ready!
Go, Tank!

15:05.660 --> 15:09.247
34! Blue!
Great. That's where we want you.

15:09.456 --> 15:13.585
- All right.
23! 22! Hut!

15:13.752 --> 15:16.463
Hut! Hut! Hut!

15:19.174 --> 15:22.302
Get in there! Hit their knees!

15:22.469 --> 15:25.305
All right, that was good. That was good.

15:28.934 --> 15:33.021
What the hell's coach got us doing?
Don't ask, just do it.

15:33.188 --> 15:36.108
See who's over there watching us?

15:36.274 --> 15:37.734
Not us. Nickerson.

15:37.901 --> 15:40.987
Riley, come here.
Alexander, come here.

15:41.154 --> 15:44.658
Riley, this is Alexander.
Follow him the entire game.

15:44.866 --> 15:46.535
And it's your key, son.

15:46.701 --> 15:49.120
He goes to take a crap,
show him the way.

15:49.287 --> 15:50.330
- Understand?
- Yes.

15:50.497 --> 15:51.957
- Can you handle it?
- Yes!

15:52.123 --> 15:53.208
- I can't hear you!
- Yes!

15:53.542 --> 15:56.795
All right, I trust you.

15:56.962 --> 16:00.757
Safeties, I want you right
up here with the linebackers.

16:00.924 --> 16:03.927
If they block down,
I want you shooting down.

16:04.094 --> 16:08.807
Djordjevic, get in here, wuss.
What's your key in this formation?

16:08.974 --> 16:11.518
I cover the tailback
or go with the flow.

16:11.726 --> 16:15.480
Listen, they can't run
against a 6-2 stack, okay?

16:15.647 --> 16:17.732
We're gonna force them to pass.

16:17.899 --> 16:19.860
- Who are we?
Ampipe!

16:20.026 --> 16:22.028
- What are we?
- Bulldogs!

16:22.237 --> 16:23.405
What are we?
Bulldogs!

16:23.572 --> 16:24.614
Who are we gonna beat?

16:24.781 --> 16:28.910
You keep them here all night
till they get it right, okay?

16:29.077 --> 16:31.746
Will do, coach.

16:32.247 --> 16:38.044
- How are we gonna beat them?
2-2! Blue!

16:45.844 --> 16:51.182
Here we go now.
Here we go. 22. Blue.

17:03.737 --> 17:06.239
Hi, baby.

17:07.365 --> 17:10.076
Well?
- Yeah, well. It was great.

17:10.242 --> 17:13.622
Those guys from Cal Poly
stayed the whole time.

17:13.788 --> 17:15.332
- And?
- Yeah, well...

17:15.498 --> 17:18.335
...we're gonna grab
a few beers, eight or nine.

17:18.501 --> 17:20.962
Eight or nine?

17:21.503 --> 17:23.339
- That's great.
- Yeah, it is.

17:23.506 --> 17:26.593
I got a good shot at
defensive backfield coach.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.429
It's down to me
and a guy from Aliquippa.

17:29.596 --> 17:32.724
Yeah, he's good, but you're better.

17:32.891 --> 17:35.477
- We're gonna get out of here.
- Yeah.

17:40.065 --> 17:44.319
Mr. Djordjevic, we'd like him
to come to our school.

17:44.486 --> 17:46.196
- Djordjevic.
- I'm sorry.

17:46.363 --> 17:49.491
- To play football?
- And to get an education.

17:50.075 --> 17:52.077
Would you tell us about that?

17:52.243 --> 17:54.913
We'll do everything
to see he gets his diploma.

17:55.121 --> 17:58.666
We have tutoring to help him
get his degree.

17:58.833 --> 18:01.753
Our people graduate, Mr. Djordjevic.

18:01.920 --> 18:06.424
We'd like you to visit the campus.
Take a look at the conditions.

18:06.591 --> 18:08.635
Meet the coaches, the players.

18:08.802 --> 18:13.139
We got two alumni in the pros now.
One of them is All-Conference.

18:13.306 --> 18:15.350
Do you want to play pro ball?

18:15.517 --> 18:17.102
Me?

18:18.061 --> 18:19.813
How about it, Pop?

18:19.979 --> 18:24.484
No, there's not much call for a 5' 10"
white cornerback in the NFL.

18:25.151 --> 18:31.032
- I could do the job in college, though.
- Yes, you can. You hit like a truck.

18:31.241 --> 18:32.867
What are you looking for?

18:33.076 --> 18:36.121
I'm looking to trade football
for an education.

18:36.329 --> 18:39.624
- I'm gonna be an engineer.
I checked your grades.

18:39.833 --> 18:43.461
A "B" average
is not going to get you a scholarship.

18:43.628 --> 18:48.341
- I know that.
- Well? We offer a B.S. in engineering.

18:49.551 --> 18:53.721
Yeah, well... You know,
Mr. Smith, I like your school.

18:53.888 --> 18:56.516
It's got a pretty good football team.

18:56.683 --> 19:02.021
But to tell you honestly, there's
other schools I'd rather look at first.

19:06.568 --> 19:10.363
Maybe you do belong
at another school, Stef.

19:10.572 --> 19:13.741
Mr. Smith, because my son
is good at football...

19:13.908 --> 19:17.620
...he has opportunities
that otherwise would not be his.

19:17.787 --> 19:21.583
I'd like to thank you for coming
and offering them.

19:21.749 --> 19:25.169
I know what you're thinking,
what you're looking for.

19:25.336 --> 19:27.171
Maybe I don't blame you.

19:27.338 --> 19:30.925
If things fall through,
you've got a place with me.

19:31.092 --> 19:34.053
Okay, thank you.

19:43.438 --> 19:45.106
I hope you know what you're doing.

19:46.566 --> 19:48.818
- That's Lisa. Pop, can I go?
- Stefen.

19:48.985 --> 19:53.448
Don't worry. I'm gonna get
a good scholarship to a good school.

19:53.656 --> 19:56.618
They haven't been
beating down the door.

19:56.826 --> 20:01.289
Yeah, you just wait till they
see me in the Walnut Heights game.

21:29.627 --> 21:32.171
Stef, stop. Stef.

21:35.007 --> 21:38.761
Stef, stop.

21:42.014 --> 21:43.933
Stef.

21:44.809 --> 21:46.727
Stop!

21:56.529 --> 21:59.157
I want to go home.

22:02.118 --> 22:08.166
- You don't have to be mad. Look at me.
- I'm looking at you. I'm not mad.

22:09.292 --> 22:15.006
Listen, I'm sorry. I guess I shouldn't
have let it go that far.

22:17.300 --> 22:21.012
- See you tomorrow?
- We have history and lunch, right?

22:21.220 --> 22:26.267
Right, Stef. Look, I'm scared,
and you're going away.

22:26.434 --> 22:30.313
I don't understand it.
It's not like I don't love you.

22:30.479 --> 22:35.484
We've been going out a long time and...

22:36.652 --> 22:40.072
...Brian and those guys see me here.
Nothing is going on.

22:40.239 --> 22:43.659
- Brian? Brian?
- I didn't mean that.

22:43.826 --> 22:47.288
- Brian, right.
- Lisa, I didn't mean that.

22:47.496 --> 22:51.500
I don't want it to be for Brian
or anybody else.

22:51.667 --> 22:57.715
- I want it to be special and not in a car.
- Okay.

22:59.717 --> 23:02.762
I understand. Let's go home.

23:13.147 --> 23:14.523
Go!

23:17.568 --> 23:19.320
Halt!

23:19.487 --> 23:24.575
Nicatancous, what are you doing?
You spin all the way from here.

23:24.742 --> 23:27.870
You really piss me off!
What's wrong with you?

23:28.037 --> 23:29.872
Nothing.
- That wasn't a block!

23:30.081 --> 23:31.415
- I can't hear you!
- Nothing, sir.

23:31.582 --> 23:34.126
What was that?
That was a third-base slide!

23:34.293 --> 23:37.088
You block about as good
as a jelly doughnut.

23:37.254 --> 23:41.008
- That was nothing! Are you listening?
- Yes!

23:41.175 --> 23:44.887
- You want to play against Walnut Heights?
- Yes, sir.

23:45.054 --> 23:46.972
- Convince us you're a dog.
- Yes, sir.

23:47.139 --> 23:50.017
I want you pissing on every
fire hydrant in Walnut Heights.

23:50.184 --> 23:52.603
- Yes, sir.
- Get down on your knees! Now growl!

23:53.979 --> 23:56.148
You bite! You dig!

23:56.315 --> 23:59.068
- You want to go to college?
- Yes, sir.

23:59.235 --> 24:02.279
- Then play the way you've been taught!
Break!

24:02.488 --> 24:04.573
Ready?
Break!

24:04.990 --> 24:09.036
Dig in there, dig in there.
Formation right!

24:09.537 --> 24:13.124
Set! Ready! Go!

24:18.921 --> 24:23.509
No. Mouse, give me that ball.
Djordjevic, what are you doing here?

24:23.676 --> 24:27.179
I've told you 1000 times,
go for the ball not the man.

24:27.346 --> 24:32.643
This is a football, see?
That's a man. There is a man over there.

24:32.810 --> 24:35.604
- Do that in a game, we got a penalty.
I had the coverage.

24:35.771 --> 24:39.066
- What?
- I had the coverage, sir. I made the play.

24:39.233 --> 24:45.114
- You do it my way, or it's the highway!
- Hustle on in. Hey, hustle up. Hustle up.

24:53.080 --> 24:56.375
- A good practice, gentlemen.
All right!

24:56.542 --> 24:59.420
Today you're not ladies, you're gentlemen.

24:59.587 --> 25:01.422
- We got any quitters?
No!

25:01.589 --> 25:04.175
- I didn't hear you.
- No, sir!

25:04.341 --> 25:08.095
You quit on this field,
you're gonna quit high school...

25:08.262 --> 25:11.473
...you're gonna quit your job, your lady.

25:11.640 --> 25:15.144
You know what you're gonna
end up being? Quitters and losers!

25:15.311 --> 25:18.147
None of you guys are quitters and losers!

25:18.314 --> 25:19.857
- Any quitters here?
- No!

25:20.482 --> 25:21.901
- Didn't hear you.
- No!

25:22.067 --> 25:23.527
- Can't hear you.
- No, sir!

25:24.695 --> 25:29.074
All right, everybody, five laps. Five laps!

25:30.910 --> 25:32.036
You do 10.

25:34.830 --> 25:38.334
- Why are you so hard on Djordjevic?
- Shit.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.378
He's good, he's got talent.
You know what?

25:41.462 --> 25:43.839
He's using me, Jess. He's using me.

25:44.006 --> 25:45.674
Hey...

25:46.008 --> 25:47.760
...relax.

25:48.385 --> 25:54.183
- They're gonna give you the job.
- Yeah? Christ, I hope so.

26:23.045 --> 26:26.507
Ready. Okay.

26:26.674 --> 26:29.301
When I say, "Ampipe,"
you say, "Bulldogs."

26:29.468 --> 26:30.886
- Ampipe.
Bulldogs!

26:31.053 --> 26:32.596
Ampipe!
- Bulldogs!

26:32.763 --> 26:35.599
- When I say, "let's," you say, "go. " Let's.
- Go!

26:35.766 --> 26:36.809
- Let's.
- Go!

27:00.332 --> 27:06.964
All right, team, get it together.
Go, Bulldogs!

27:21.895 --> 27:28.152
This rally, this game
is not just for the students.

27:28.318 --> 27:32.114
It's for the whole town.

27:32.906 --> 27:39.580
It's for the mothers,
for the fathers and the steelworkers!

27:43.208 --> 27:47.754
And now, here's the man
who's gonna bring us a victory...

27:47.921 --> 27:54.344
...and who's gonna make Ampipe
what it used to be. Coach Nickerson!

27:59.057 --> 28:01.393
Walnut Heights is undefeated.

28:06.064 --> 28:09.985
And Walnut Heights is ranked
third in the state.

28:11.487 --> 28:16.575
They have a swim team, a tennis team.
They got golf for boys and girls!

28:17.409 --> 28:21.330
But they don't have
a football team like we've got.

28:21.997 --> 28:26.210
And they don't have a
student body like we have!

28:29.630 --> 28:31.089
I've gotta talk to you.
What?

28:31.256 --> 28:33.926
I've gotta talk to you.

28:41.099 --> 28:42.851
Tracy's pregnant.

28:43.769 --> 28:47.564
- What?
- Tracy's pregnant. I took her to the doctor.

28:47.731 --> 28:51.318
We are gonna beat
Walnut Heights because we're Ampipe.

28:51.526 --> 28:57.115
And this Ampipe football team
can't lose! They're gonna win!

28:59.409 --> 29:03.205
Well, how does she feel
about an abortion?

29:03.288 --> 29:06.041
You know Tracy, not real good.

29:07.793 --> 29:10.128
You dumb bastard.

29:11.004 --> 29:15.759
What are you gonna do?
You gonna have the kid? Huh?

29:20.555 --> 29:23.600
What am I supposed to do, Stef?

29:23.767 --> 29:30.065
Captain, quarterback,
team leader, Clarence Oliver, Rifleman.

29:30.273 --> 29:35.445
What you do is you talk
to your recruiter at SC, okay?

29:35.612 --> 29:40.325
I've heard about stuff like this.
They can work things out for you-

29:40.492 --> 29:45.080
- I'm having a kid.
- Look, we're getting out of here, Brian.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.791
Right?

29:48.125 --> 29:51.920
I proudly introduce
defensive captain and linebacker...

29:52.087 --> 29:54.798
Right, Bri? Bri?

29:54.965 --> 29:57.551
...Brian Riley!

30:12.315 --> 30:17.738
This is the biggest game of our lives.
We've worked hard.

30:19.740 --> 30:23.326
We no longer want to win.
We have to win.

30:23.493 --> 30:26.538
And we're gonna. We're gonna win.

30:29.249 --> 30:34.546
Not just for us, but for you too.
Thanks a lot.

32:35.583 --> 32:37.419
Jeez, look at the place.

32:39.838 --> 32:44.050
Now this is what a real locker room
looks like.

33:27.385 --> 33:30.138
- Tank, you take my tape roll?
Fuck it.

33:30.305 --> 33:33.016
Did you take my tape roll, huh?

33:33.183 --> 33:34.893
Did you take it?

33:35.059 --> 33:39.314
Cut it out, man! Save it for the field, Vucci.

34:04.464 --> 34:06.257
Let's go, fellas.

34:06.424 --> 34:09.052
That's everybody.

34:10.303 --> 34:13.681
Let me have it over here.
Right here, let's have it.

34:19.896 --> 34:22.232
Settle down.

34:35.370 --> 34:37.246
Gentlemen.

34:38.498 --> 34:40.083
Here's the situation.

34:40.875 --> 34:43.753
We haven't beaten Walnut Heights
in my five years as coach.

34:43.962 --> 34:48.049
There are people out there
who don't think you're gonna do it.

34:48.967 --> 34:52.053
But there's 37 people
in this room who can.

34:52.219 --> 34:53.471
Yes, sir!
- Right?

34:53.638 --> 34:55.806
Yes, sir!

34:55.974 --> 34:58.643
That's you, and that's me.

34:58.810 --> 35:01.563
Why are we so sure?
What do we know?

35:01.729 --> 35:05.858
I don't think they know about
the pain you're willing to endure.

35:06.067 --> 35:07.443
- Do they, Tank?
- No.

35:07.610 --> 35:11.072
Or how hard you hit.
- No, sir.

35:11.281 --> 35:14.742
- Or what you'll do to Alexander.
- No, sir!

35:14.909 --> 35:18.830
- They don't know about Rifleman's arm.
- No, sir.

35:19.038 --> 35:24.836
In 48 minutes they're gonna find out who
you are. You're gonna make me proud.

35:25.044 --> 35:30.800
You guys are gonna achieve some great
successes. And I hope and pray you do.

35:30.967 --> 35:36.097
There's seldom gonna be a moment like
tonight when you hold it all in your hands.

35:36.306 --> 35:40.435
You can achieve something together
they can never take away.

35:40.643 --> 35:45.648
Your friends, your family,
your parents, your school, this town.

35:45.815 --> 35:49.819
A win tonight is gonna give them
something to be proud of.

35:50.278 --> 35:54.991
You know what they call us? You know
why they only gave us 500 tickets?

35:55.158 --> 35:59.162
We're the dagos, we're the Polacks,
we're the niggers!

35:59.329 --> 36:02.957
That's what you are. That's what I am.
That's what we are.

36:03.124 --> 36:06.252
That's how we're gonna
win this game, together!

36:06.461 --> 36:07.837
- How?
- Together!

36:08.004 --> 36:09.172
- How?
- Together!

36:09.338 --> 36:10.631
- We'll do it!
- Together!

36:10.798 --> 36:12.216
- How?
- Together!

36:12.425 --> 36:15.887
We're gonna win together!
Come on down!

36:20.558 --> 36:24.437
Now taking the field
the Ampipe Bulldogs.

36:27.857 --> 36:30.443
And here come your Knights!

36:46.876 --> 36:50.046
Ampipe kicks off.

36:50.254 --> 36:53.508
And the game is under way!

36:59.138 --> 37:01.516
Come on! Get tough!

37:04.894 --> 37:08.940
- Six-two stack monster. Ready!
Break!

37:09.315 --> 37:12.527
- All right, fellows, this is it!
Break!

37:13.361 --> 37:15.780
Full house! Full house!

37:16.280 --> 37:20.117
- I'm coming after your ass, Riley!
- Do it. Make me happy!

37:35.466 --> 37:39.095
Way to go, way to go, all right.
- Way to go, LaRue.

37:39.637 --> 37:43.641
Bellow, come here.
Why can't we block those little turkeys?

37:43.808 --> 37:47.019
- They're cutting my knees.
- I don't want to hear that.

37:47.186 --> 37:49.772
Block them anyway. Now let's do it.

38:07.415 --> 38:11.085
That's the end
of the first quarter. No score.

38:11.294 --> 38:12.503
Break!

38:12.712 --> 38:14.005
Break!

38:23.681 --> 38:26.475
Ready, set!

38:26.642 --> 38:28.769
Hut! Hut!

38:32.398 --> 38:35.860
Alexander's in the clear.

38:36.527 --> 38:38.863
Touchdown!

38:39.405 --> 38:42.366
And the Knights take the lead!

38:54.628 --> 38:58.299
Ampipe's ball 2:48 left in the half.

39:19.695 --> 39:23.532
Ampipe touchdown
by number 19 Austin Williams.

39:25.951 --> 39:28.245
Yeah. All right!

39:40.091 --> 39:46.764
Walnut Heights leads 10-7
with 3:47 left in the game.

40:05.825 --> 40:08.327
We did it! We did it!
- Yeah!

40:08.536 --> 40:10.746
Stefen!

40:11.080 --> 40:13.874
In your face Walnut High! In your face!

40:14.041 --> 40:20.673
Ampipe touchdown
by number 33 Stefen Djordjevic.

40:34.979 --> 40:41.527
Ampipe leads 14-10
with 3:12 left in the game.

40:56.333 --> 41:00.796
Alexander for 17
and a first down on the Ampipe 42.

41:08.470 --> 41:10.097
Hold that line!

41:15.519 --> 41:19.732
Great catch by Alexander down to the 29!

41:28.115 --> 41:29.783
Out of bounds on the 10.

41:29.992 --> 41:33.203
- First and goal for the Knights.
That's my man.

41:33.370 --> 41:35.539
Ready. Set.

41:46.008 --> 41:51.055
Pass interference. The Knights have
the ball on the Ampipe five-yard line.

41:51.221 --> 41:53.974
You got a boy
playing for Walnut Heights?

41:54.141 --> 41:57.561
You hit too soon. It's your penalty.
Interference.

41:57.770 --> 41:59.313
- It's the same play from practice.
- Shit!

41:59.480 --> 42:00.522
It's the same play!

42:00.731 --> 42:04.234
- Blind bastard!
Good hit! It was a good hit!

42:04.401 --> 42:07.780
It was a good hit!
You're damn right. Come on.

42:09.031 --> 42:15.162
Okay, we're holding them. Now keep up
goal line D, goal line D! Ready! Break!

42:15.621 --> 42:18.665
Third and goal for the Knights
on the three.

42:22.544 --> 42:25.422
Ready! Set! Hut-hut!

42:29.551 --> 42:34.264
- Hold them! Come on!
Yeah! Yeah! All right!

42:35.682 --> 42:37.101
Fight, damn it, fight!

42:37.976 --> 42:42.689
Fourth and goal for the Knights
on the one-yard line! This is it!

42:48.028 --> 42:54.284
Ready! Set!
- Hold them! You fucking bastards!

43:04.128 --> 43:07.548
Alexander is stopped short
of the goal line!

43:10.259 --> 43:15.389
Ampipe takes over on their own one-
yard line with 12 seconds left.

43:21.270 --> 43:23.480
- We did it, Riley!
Did we do it?

43:23.647 --> 43:25.107
You did it!

43:26.483 --> 43:27.860
Rifleman!

43:28.068 --> 43:30.612
- Coach!
- I strong right, 42 condition.

43:30.779 --> 43:32.406
All right!

43:52.301 --> 43:56.513
Salvucci fumbles in
the end zone and the Knights recover.

43:56.680 --> 44:02.269
It's a touchdown! No time left. Knights
win! Touchdown. The Knights win!

45:30.148 --> 45:35.028
Come on, Salvucci.
Let's hear a good cry, all right.

45:35.195 --> 45:40.367
All I'm hearing is a whimper. Let's
hear a cry! I want to hear a good one.

45:41.034 --> 45:46.915
You choked! You cost us the game.
You quit on me and on this team.

45:47.416 --> 45:49.876
He didn't quit.

45:52.045 --> 45:54.089
What did you say?

45:57.217 --> 46:02.013
Well, Salvucci, he didn't quit.
None of us quit.

46:03.849 --> 46:08.770
I don't know. We beat those guys'
asses up and down that field tonight!

46:10.397 --> 46:15.110
We got nothing to be ashamed of, right?
Isn't that right?

46:15.318 --> 46:20.740
You know, maybe the scoreboard
doesn't say it, but we won that game.

46:23.952 --> 46:25.829
We held them.

46:27.330 --> 46:32.085
It was just a fluke.
That's all, it's just a fluke.

46:32.252 --> 46:34.087
A fluke?

46:35.005 --> 46:39.301
That pass interference penalty,
that was no fluke.

46:39.968 --> 46:42.971
If you had done it the way
I taught you...

46:43.138 --> 46:47.893
...they never would've been down there
and scored and we would've won!

46:48.852 --> 46:51.813
You're just as responsible as he is.

46:56.151 --> 47:01.823
If you'd have had Rifleman hold
on to the ball, then we would've won.

47:02.032 --> 47:04.200
We didn't quit, you quit!

47:05.619 --> 47:10.582
Get your stuff and you get the hell
out of here right now.

47:11.166 --> 47:12.834
What?

47:14.044 --> 47:18.924
You heard me. You get out of here.
You're through. You're off the team.

47:48.536 --> 47:52.540
I'll see you, I gotta get on the bus.
All right.

47:52.874 --> 47:56.378
- Yeah, that's him. Right there.
Wait up.

47:59.422 --> 48:02.676
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Where you going?

48:02.884 --> 48:05.553
- On the bus.
No, this is the wrong bus.

48:05.720 --> 48:09.391
This is for players.
You ride with the cheerleaders.

48:17.565 --> 48:21.319
- Stef? Stef? Okay.
- Hey, Lisa, don't talk to me now.

48:21.486 --> 48:24.239
- I want to be left alone.
- You were good.

48:24.406 --> 48:26.866
Just leave me alone!

48:46.428 --> 48:52.350
Why didn't Nickerson take
the safety and then punt it out of there?

48:52.517 --> 48:57.397
Because he's an asshole. We're never
gonna beat those rich pricks.

48:57.564 --> 49:02.861
Not as long as he's coach we won't.
- Maybe that won't be for too long.

49:05.738 --> 49:08.324
Goddamn it, it's true.

49:08.491 --> 49:12.704
He's kicked off for disciplinary
reasons. What does that mean?

49:12.871 --> 49:16.207
- His big mouth got him in trouble.
- What'd he say?

49:16.374 --> 49:18.877
He knew this would ruin his chances.

49:19.043 --> 49:24.507
Word gets around he has a bad attitude,
he'll be lucky if he gets any offers.

49:24.674 --> 49:27.427
I can't believe he meant it.
Everybody's-

49:27.594 --> 49:29.929
Your kid cost us the game.

49:33.683 --> 49:35.602
Oh! Hot damn!

49:35.768 --> 49:38.980
I'm gonna go home and wait
for your brother.

49:39.147 --> 49:42.567
Because whatever he said,
he'll have to apologize.

49:42.734 --> 49:45.403
Sure, Pop. Sure.

49:47.071 --> 49:49.157
Goddamn!

50:08.134 --> 50:09.719
Hey! Hey!

50:10.011 --> 50:14.015
Hey, Stefie, come on in.
All right.

51:15.159 --> 51:18.037
Suzie?
Uh-huh?

51:18.204 --> 51:20.581
I should've had Rifleman
fall on the ball.

51:22.458 --> 51:26.879
Please, Vern,
you're driving yourself crazy.

51:27.046 --> 51:32.093
Daddy, there's a man playing
on the lawn, and he waked me up.

51:32.260 --> 51:35.346
Honey, you get in bed with Mommy,
okay?

51:44.021 --> 51:45.690
Hey.

51:46.858 --> 51:49.777
Bosko.
What the hell are you guys doing?

51:49.986 --> 51:53.281
What do you think?
- Isn't this a little crazy?

51:53.448 --> 51:56.033
You gonna do something about it?

52:22.560 --> 52:24.312
Bastards.

52:38.075 --> 52:39.535
Hey, Stef!

52:39.952 --> 52:42.079
- Hey.
- How you doing?

52:42.246 --> 52:46.125
- You going to talk to the coach?
- Yeah. Wish me luck.

52:46.292 --> 52:49.253
- Want me to go with you?
- No.

52:49.462 --> 52:50.963
You sure?

52:51.130 --> 52:54.800
- Okay, good luck, pal.
- All right.

52:56.219 --> 52:57.678
Hey.

52:58.804 --> 53:01.599
- How you doing, man?
- How you doing?

53:15.613 --> 53:17.406
Coach Nickerson.

53:21.953 --> 53:27.458
I'd just like to say I'm sorry about
what I said. I didn't mean anything.

53:28.709 --> 53:33.673
And, well, Friday, it's our last game,
it's at home, and I'm a senior.

53:33.839 --> 53:37.718
I'd really like to play,
and it means a lot to me.

53:37.885 --> 53:43.224
And I feel really bad
about what happened.

53:43.391 --> 53:47.103
I was hoping maybe you'd take me
back on the team.

53:47.645 --> 53:48.938
I'm sorry.

53:51.983 --> 53:53.651
So what?

53:56.904 --> 53:59.281
Real forgiving, aren't you?

54:02.034 --> 54:04.829
You were at the house, and I saw you.

54:04.996 --> 54:08.165
The best thing you can do
is get out of here.

54:08.791 --> 54:13.546
I can explain. They picked me up.
I just dumped garbage on your lawn.

54:13.713 --> 54:15.631
- I tried to stop them!
- No.

54:15.840 --> 54:19.260
You dumped garbage on me,
my wife, my little girl.

54:19.427 --> 54:21.178
- I'm sorry.
- Now leave me alone.

54:21.345 --> 54:25.057
What about the game?

54:25.516 --> 54:28.602
I mean, this is the last game.

54:29.395 --> 54:31.272
Please.

54:32.148 --> 54:34.483
You've played your last game.

54:44.243 --> 54:47.329
Coach, you are really fucked, man!

54:48.122 --> 54:51.125
No, son. You are.

55:02.887 --> 55:04.346
Lisa!

55:07.016 --> 55:12.980
How about it, Lis? I was at
band practice today watching you.

55:13.147 --> 55:17.067
- You're real good.
- Yeah, I saw you there, Stef.

55:18.277 --> 55:23.157
Maybe I'll join the band to spend
more time with you. How's that sound?

55:23.324 --> 55:26.494
It sounds like Nickerson
didn't take you back.

55:26.660 --> 55:31.499
Screw Nickerson. I've got the grades,
the talent. I'll get my scholarship.

55:31.665 --> 55:35.961
You'll get your football scholarship,
I'll get nothing.

55:36.128 --> 55:38.172
What are you talking about?

55:39.465 --> 55:44.887
Asshole jocks who can't spell their
names get scholarships and I can't.

55:45.054 --> 55:46.931
Asshole jocks?

55:47.389 --> 55:52.061
An asshole who'd scream at his
girlfriend who he says he loves...

55:52.228 --> 55:54.605
...in front of a busload of people.

55:54.772 --> 55:58.150
- I don't need to be treated like that!
- Wait, Lisa.

55:58.317 --> 56:02.071
I apologize. A lot was going on.
You don't understand.

56:02.238 --> 56:05.366
I don't understand?
You don't understand!

56:05.908 --> 56:10.496
I want to go to college and study
music. But we can't afford it.

56:10.663 --> 56:15.793
Nobody in Ampipe gets a music
scholarship, just football scholarships!

56:16.335 --> 56:18.754
So I'll be a grocery clerk.

56:22.341 --> 56:29.014
I'm stuck here, Stef. I haven't even
got a chance. I'm 17 years old.

56:29.556 --> 56:32.184
It's not fucking fair.

56:32.643 --> 56:37.648
And, you, you're so selfish,
you don't even see it.

56:42.403 --> 56:47.324
- God, I've been such an asshole, huh?
- Yes.

56:48.784 --> 56:50.244
Yeah.

56:52.079 --> 56:54.665
I can spell my own name, though.

56:55.916 --> 56:59.878
No, Lis, I mean, I don't know what-

57:03.090 --> 57:08.178
I'm really sorry.
What can I do to make it up to you?

57:08.345 --> 57:10.431
Just be my friend.

57:13.225 --> 57:15.185
I can do that.

57:17.021 --> 57:18.856
I need you, Lis.

57:19.023 --> 57:24.611
I need you too sometimes, you know?
You gotta be there for me.

57:26.488 --> 57:30.367
Okay, I will. I promise.

57:31.035 --> 57:33.996
I promise. I'm sorry.

57:35.539 --> 57:41.920
I'm sorry. I promise I won't pressure
you about what happened last week.

57:42.087 --> 57:47.551
You know, sex and all that stuff.
It's stupid, and, I'm sorry.

57:47.718 --> 57:49.553
Yeah, you will.

57:51.805 --> 57:53.807
How do you know that?

57:56.560 --> 58:00.606
You're so gorgeous,
I just can't help it. That's why.

58:02.232 --> 58:08.447
I love you so much, Lisa.
I'm sorry. I just mess up.

58:13.327 --> 58:15.788
Now I get to carry this, huh?

58:16.371 --> 58:18.165
Come on!

58:19.082 --> 58:24.963
I don't need to graduate, I need a job.
My uncle and brother are out of work.

58:25.172 --> 58:29.384
You quit school, you'll be on the
streets. How will that help?

58:29.593 --> 58:33.263
Let me make some calls.
Before you make a decision.

58:33.430 --> 58:35.599
Hey, Nick, how's it going?

58:35.766 --> 58:38.352
Sherm, how are you?
- Nice to see you.

58:38.519 --> 58:40.687
Vinnie,
Sherm Williams, Boston College.

58:40.854 --> 58:44.483
I've heard good things.
Everything okay?

58:44.650 --> 58:47.319
- That time of year again?
- Playing Pitt.

58:47.486 --> 58:49.530
- I understand, you-
- Hold it.

58:49.696 --> 58:53.367
- Vinnie. I know you're no quitter.
- What?

58:53.575 --> 58:57.287
- Don't quit on me, man.
- Right, coach.

58:57.454 --> 59:00.082
Hey, nice to meet you.

59:00.249 --> 59:04.628
I understand you had a hell
of a defense against Walnut Heights.

59:04.795 --> 59:08.298
I want to see film on Riley,
Djordjevic and Oliver.

59:08.465 --> 59:12.928
Riley and Oliver, they're good.
Djordjevic, I got to pass on.

59:13.095 --> 59:16.765
- Why? That kid's tough.
- He's got an attitude problem.

59:16.932 --> 59:21.270
- I cut him from the team.
- That must have been a tough decision.

59:23.897 --> 59:25.774
Yeah, it was tough.

59:29.194 --> 59:32.906
How about it, Greg?
How about what, Stef?

59:35.742 --> 59:38.161
I don't know. How you doing?

59:39.454 --> 59:42.499
- You want to use the car tonight?
- What?

59:42.666 --> 59:45.585
Just drop me off at the Carpatho.

59:46.878 --> 59:51.758
- You're not going to go to the game?
- No, I'm going to go get drunk.

59:57.973 --> 01:00:04.146
I got laid off today.
Me and 700 others.

01:00:05.605 --> 01:00:11.737
- What are you going to do?
- I told you. I'm gonna get shit-faced.

01:00:11.903 --> 01:00:14.114
I mean, after that.

01:00:15.824 --> 01:00:17.492
I don't know.

01:00:18.535 --> 01:00:20.412
I'm real sorry.

01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:35.695
- Aren't you supposed to be at the game?
- I hate football.

01:01:35.862 --> 01:01:40.367
I just like to watch number
33 run around in those tight pants.

01:01:41.326 --> 01:01:45.080
It's pretty cold out here.
You want to go upstairs?

01:01:45.247 --> 01:01:46.832
I'll beat you!

01:01:51.378 --> 01:01:54.965
- What were you doing up here?
- Just drawing.

01:01:55.590 --> 01:02:02.180
- Then show me.
- You want to see? Step into my office.

01:02:07.727 --> 01:02:09.688
Did you do all these?

01:02:10.313 --> 01:02:16.653
Yeah. This is what I've been playing
football for, for the past 10 years.

01:02:17.112 --> 01:02:18.488
What's that one?

01:02:18.655 --> 01:02:24.160
That's my undersea dome. It's just
one of the first things I ever did.

01:02:24.327 --> 01:02:25.870
It's good.

01:02:26.788 --> 01:02:30.542
- Where's your dad?
- He's at work.

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:38.300
- And Greg?
- Carpatho.

01:02:39.092 --> 01:02:43.847
- Are we alone?
- Yeah. I could call someone.

01:02:44.681 --> 01:02:46.141
No.

01:02:48.685 --> 01:02:52.272
Why don't you take your coat off
and stay a while?

01:02:52.814 --> 01:02:55.191
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:14.627
- You got that right over your bed.
- Yeah. Remember that night?

01:03:20.008 --> 01:03:23.595
I've got a funny outfit to show you.

01:03:42.572 --> 01:03:44.449
It's cute.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.938
I love you.

01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:42.442
I love you too, Lis.

01:06:12.096 --> 01:06:15.224
You hear from Syracuse or
any other school?

01:06:15.391 --> 01:06:16.768
No.

01:06:17.185 --> 01:06:20.480
Pretty soon it'll be
letter-of-intent day.

01:06:20.647 --> 01:06:23.441
The last school I saw
was Walnut Heights.

01:06:23.608 --> 01:06:26.486
- How about it, Vin?
- Fuck school, man.

01:06:26.652 --> 01:06:28.821
Fuck Christmas.

01:07:09.487 --> 01:07:12.323
Hi, Miss Malevik.
- How are you?

01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:17.453
- All right. Do I get a kiss?
Where are you going?

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.205
Don't ask.
- Pittsburgh.

01:07:19.372 --> 01:07:22.500
- See the Penguins and Flyers.
Aren't we lucky?

01:07:22.667 --> 01:07:24.252
- Can I come?
- I'm surprised you're not.

01:07:24.418 --> 01:07:25.461
No. You don't go.

01:07:25.628 --> 01:07:28.464
- He's only kidding.
- Honeymoon, they go alone.

01:07:28.631 --> 01:07:31.384
- That settles that.
Will you carry this?

01:07:31.551 --> 01:07:33.845
Bye, Miss Malevik.
Goodbye.

01:07:36.347 --> 01:07:40.518
- How you doing?
- All right. How are you doing?

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.687
Big day.

01:07:43.604 --> 01:07:46.315
I heard Nickerson got
that coaching job.

01:07:46.482 --> 01:07:50.611
Yeah. Apparently the guy
in Aliquippa got a better offer.

01:07:50.778 --> 01:07:54.991
A toast. To the bride, the groom...

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:59.620
...and the baby. May it be a boy.
Na zdrowie.

01:08:02.123 --> 01:08:03.541
Thanks.

01:08:09.213 --> 01:08:12.049
- What do you think of this?
- I know.

01:08:13.301 --> 01:08:16.804
Tracy always wanted a big wedding
with a long gown.

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:19.390
Every girl does, I guess.

01:08:19.932 --> 01:08:23.185
Like we wanted to play
for the Steelers, huh?

01:08:28.357 --> 01:08:31.569
- I'll give you a hand with this stuff.
- Yeah.

01:08:52.256 --> 01:08:56.385
Should we be spending
U.S. tax dollars in Guatemala-?

01:08:56.551 --> 01:08:59.846
Excuse me, Miss Dudukovich.
- Yes, sir.

01:09:00.305 --> 01:09:02.808
- Yes, I do.
- She doesn't.

01:09:05.185 --> 01:09:07.854
Police officer. You're under arrest.

01:09:16.863 --> 01:09:19.116
All right. Come on!

01:09:26.916 --> 01:09:30.377
- Hold it! Where are you taking him?
To jail.

01:09:30.544 --> 01:09:32.296
- What for?
Armed robbery.

01:09:32.462 --> 01:09:34.881
Help me, coach!

01:09:35.256 --> 01:09:37.676
Hey! Help me, coach!

01:09:40.304 --> 01:09:43.140
Come on, what are you, chicken?

01:09:45.643 --> 01:09:47.353
Hold it.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.689
- Babe, I want you to wait here, okay?
- No way, Stef. Come on.

01:09:57.655 --> 01:10:00.408
Hey, Henry, can I have another Iron?

01:10:01.158 --> 01:10:03.160
- How about it, Mr. Bosko?!
- Mr. Bosko.

01:10:03.369 --> 01:10:04.995
Hey, Stef. Lisa Lietzke.

01:10:05.204 --> 01:10:10.251
- What can I do for you?
- Mr. Bosko, I have a real problem.

01:10:10.418 --> 01:10:14.797
Nickerson is blackballing me
because of the stuff at his house.

01:10:14.964 --> 01:10:18.342
I was hoping you'd tell him what
really happened.

01:10:18.509 --> 01:10:20.344
What really happened?

01:10:20.761 --> 01:10:23.347
No college will even touch me now.

01:10:23.514 --> 01:10:28.894
- Come on, Bosko, the whole town knows.
- Knows what? That I was there?

01:10:29.061 --> 01:10:34.150
Hey. Was I at Nickerson's house?
Did I trash it? Were you there?

01:10:34.316 --> 01:10:36.444
Were any of you there?

01:10:39.155 --> 01:10:43.868
- Please. You gotta help me.
- I don't gotta do anything.

01:10:44.743 --> 01:10:48.372
I don't plan on spending
the rest of my life here.

01:10:48.539 --> 01:10:52.084
Now, you can't even get a job in
that goddamn mill!

01:10:52.251 --> 01:10:56.130
That goddamn mill.
Is that your problem, Stef?

01:10:56.297 --> 01:11:00.467
Hey, fellas. Stef's got a problem
with the goddamn mill.

01:11:00.634 --> 01:11:03.721
Where your father works?
Where your brother works?

01:11:03.888 --> 01:11:05.556
My brother was laid off.

01:11:05.723 --> 01:11:09.852
Where my father worked and all
who made this town what it is?

01:11:10.019 --> 01:11:11.854
You mean, what it was.

01:11:14.815 --> 01:11:17.026
You too good for us or something?

01:11:17.985 --> 01:11:20.863
No, sir. I just want to go to college.

01:11:23.115 --> 01:11:27.828
Stef. Is that what's the matter, Stef?

01:11:28.787 --> 01:11:33.459
- You getting tired of Polack pussy?
- You son of a bitch!

01:11:37.504 --> 01:11:41.258
All right. Enough. Enough! Enough!
I said enough!

01:11:46.347 --> 01:11:47.932
Bosko.

01:11:54.355 --> 01:11:58.859
Hey, Djordjevic,
we'll see you around, okay?

01:12:32.559 --> 01:12:35.854
- Yes?
- Mrs. Nickerson, my name is Lisa Lietzke.

01:12:36.021 --> 01:12:38.190
Can I talk to you for a moment?

01:12:39.441 --> 01:12:44.196
Please believe me. I know Stef,
and he'd never try to hurt anyone.

01:12:45.656 --> 01:12:49.368
He's a kid. He wants to go to college
and be something.

01:12:49.535 --> 01:12:52.121
And your husband's stopping him.

01:12:52.705 --> 01:12:56.709
You know, someone happens to bow out,
or a spot opens up...

01:12:56.875 --> 01:13:01.004
...I would appreciate it if you could
keep me in mind.

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.923
Yes, sir.

01:13:03.757 --> 01:13:07.594
Okay. Thank you for your time.

01:13:07.803 --> 01:13:12.891
- What would you do? Would you go?
- I'm a junior. I have a year left.

01:13:13.058 --> 01:13:15.227
What about after you graduate?

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:21.608
You know, if he leaves here
you'll probably lose him.

01:13:21.775 --> 01:13:24.069
I have to let him go. I love him.

01:13:24.278 --> 01:13:29.366
I was in love in high school. We were
gonna get married after graduation.

01:13:29.533 --> 01:13:33.871
The Army took him. I went to
North Carolina State and met Vern.

01:13:35.747 --> 01:13:38.000
What do you want to do, Lisa?

01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:41.211
I want to study music.

01:13:41.879 --> 01:13:43.672
Then do it.

01:13:45.048 --> 01:13:48.719
- What happened to that high school boy?
- Tommy?

01:13:48.886 --> 01:13:53.891
I guess he's in Parkersburg. I haven't
thought about him in 100 years.

01:13:55.225 --> 01:13:58.770
- God, I loved him.
- No more than I love Stef.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.375
Well, yes, sir, I realize it's a little
late, but I've been very busy.

01:14:20.542 --> 01:14:23.545
You know, I was
meaning to call you sooner.

01:14:26.173 --> 01:14:29.301
Mr. Smith, you said
I could count on you.

01:14:34.598 --> 01:14:37.726
I understand. Okay.

01:14:39.102 --> 01:14:40.562
Thanks anyway.

01:14:58.038 --> 01:15:00.040
Drink some of this.

01:15:07.255 --> 01:15:10.133
Are you ashamed of me, Papa?

01:15:10.801 --> 01:15:13.845
What are you talking about?
That's crazy.

01:15:14.846 --> 01:15:18.809
You're my son. I love you.
Why would I be ashamed of you?

01:15:19.434 --> 01:15:24.648
I don't know. I must have done
something wrong for this to happen.

01:15:25.482 --> 01:15:29.361
You've done nothing wrong, Stefen.
You're a good boy.

01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:33.865
I love you. We love you.

01:15:35.367 --> 01:15:38.161
Your mother was always proud of you.

01:15:39.663 --> 01:15:41.665
I know you're hurt.

01:15:43.041 --> 01:15:45.919
It's okay. I understand.

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:51.717
- I love you and I'm proud of you.
- I'm sorry.

01:15:51.883 --> 01:15:54.970
I was never prouder of you
than right now.

01:16:16.575 --> 01:16:19.202
- You got it.
You got it, bro.

01:16:21.288 --> 01:16:22.789
Drink.

01:16:24.708 --> 01:16:27.419
- How's it going, man?
That's for luck.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.923
Hey, can I have your attention?
Everybody.

01:16:32.132 --> 01:16:37.012
I'd like to toast a friend who couldn't
be with us. To Vinnie Salvucci.

01:16:37.179 --> 01:16:39.264
- To the Vucc.
To Vucc.

01:17:03.538 --> 01:17:05.165
What's it going to be?

01:17:05.332 --> 01:17:06.416
- Girl.
- A boy.

01:17:26.228 --> 01:17:29.814
I'm going to West Virginia.
To West Virginia!

01:17:30.023 --> 01:17:33.276
Good for him.
He wanted to go to West Virginia.

01:17:33.443 --> 01:17:36.821
- Shadow. Here's to West Virginia.
- Here's to it.

01:17:37.572 --> 01:17:44.204
- And SC, right, Brian?
- Stef, man. I'm going to have a kid.

01:17:45.747 --> 01:17:47.916
That's more important than college.

01:17:49.668 --> 01:17:54.422
I got what I want.
I really got what I wanted.

01:18:05.267 --> 01:18:07.060
How you doing, Trace?

01:18:07.227 --> 01:18:10.939
You're the 18th person that's
touched my stomach.

01:18:15.652 --> 01:18:19.322
- Job? What job?
- Greg got on with a demolition company.

01:18:19.489 --> 01:18:22.701
He pulled a few strings and got me
weekend work.

01:18:22.909 --> 01:18:25.829
- Doing what?
- You know that blast furnace...

01:18:25.996 --> 01:18:30.458
...down at Franklin and Seven?
Tearing that piece of shit apart.

01:18:30.625 --> 01:18:34.879
My father worked there 14, 15 years.

01:18:35.922 --> 01:18:40.093
Then on the fifth day, thank you, God,
he created cheerleaders.

01:18:40.301 --> 01:18:43.430
- Amen.
- And commanded that they wear skirts...

01:18:43.596 --> 01:18:46.182
...and do cartwheels,
and that was very good!

01:18:46.349 --> 01:18:50.353
Great.
- I mean, that was pretty good.

01:18:50.603 --> 01:18:55.775
And on the sixth day,
he created the football player.

01:18:55.942 --> 01:19:00.822
And fans paid money
to watch them hurt.

01:19:01.698 --> 01:19:05.952
And that was good. On the seventh day...

01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:11.332
...they all played football.

01:19:11.499 --> 01:19:16.671
Six-two stack monster.
Six-two stack monster. Ready, hut!

01:19:38.401 --> 01:19:41.362
- He's over there on the counter.
- I know.

01:20:03.885 --> 01:20:07.347
Mrs. Nickerson, excuse me.

01:20:09.098 --> 01:20:15.021
I want to tell you I know it's late
and I have to say this for my own sake.

01:20:15.188 --> 01:20:18.900
I was there the night your house
got messed up.

01:20:19.108 --> 01:20:23.112
And I'm sorry it happened.

01:20:34.958 --> 01:20:36.834
Hey, Djordjevic!

01:20:39.337 --> 01:20:42.423
Djordjevic, I'd like to talk to you.

01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:45.134
We got nothing to talk about.

01:20:45.885 --> 01:20:47.387
Where are you going?

01:20:47.553 --> 01:20:48.846
- Where am I going?
- Yeah.

01:20:51.015 --> 01:20:53.142
No place, man.

01:20:53.393 --> 01:20:57.981
Shadow, he's going to West Virginia.
He just found out tonight.

01:20:58.147 --> 01:21:02.277
Tank's going to Furman, you knew that.
You're going to Cal Poly.

01:21:02.777 --> 01:21:04.779
Mouse...

01:21:05.989 --> 01:21:08.574
Mouse is going to college.
He's gonna play ball.

01:21:10.743 --> 01:21:14.831
Me, I'm just gonna hang out here.
I don't know. You know.

01:21:16.791 --> 01:21:22.755
Hey, Nickerson. You lied about me.
You blackballed me.

01:21:24.507 --> 01:21:29.178
Together, remember that?
Together, together, together.

01:21:29.387 --> 01:21:32.098
That was always just bullshit.

01:21:32.515 --> 01:21:35.393
- What?
- You're full of shit, man.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:41.691
You sit in your office, scholarship,
no scholarship. He goes, he stays.

01:21:42.567 --> 01:21:46.446
Who in the hell gave you that power?

01:21:46.654 --> 01:21:49.991
You're just a coach.
A high school football coach.

01:21:51.159 --> 01:21:52.869
I mean...

01:21:55.705 --> 01:21:57.832
I don't know.

01:22:08.134 --> 01:22:09.802
You know...

01:22:11.512 --> 01:22:16.976
...Nickerson, you are not God!

01:22:17.602 --> 01:22:21.731
You are just a typing teacher.

01:24:11.048 --> 01:24:13.050
- Mr. Djordjevic.
- Hello, Lisa.

01:24:13.217 --> 01:24:15.469
- Hi, Greg.
- Hey, Lisa.

01:24:21.309 --> 01:24:23.561
It's so good to see you.

01:24:24.854 --> 01:24:29.108
- You've been working hard.
- What have you been up to?

01:24:31.402 --> 01:24:34.572
- What's he doing here?
He's been looking for you.

01:24:34.739 --> 01:24:39.410
I brought him here.
Listen, why don't you just talk to him?

01:24:47.668 --> 01:24:49.420
Just talk to him, huh?

01:24:49.587 --> 01:24:51.630
Hi, Joe.
Hello. How are you?

01:24:52.089 --> 01:24:53.799
Hi, Greg.
Coach.

01:24:53.966 --> 01:24:56.844
How are you feeling?
- Okay.

01:24:58.512 --> 01:25:00.306
Djordjevic.

01:25:02.808 --> 01:25:06.353
I've come here to apologize.
I wanted to tell you...

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:10.900
...that I'm sorry about what I did.
You know, and I was wrong.

01:25:11.692 --> 01:25:13.527
I'm sorry.

01:25:15.404 --> 01:25:21.786
I'd like you to come play football
for me at Cal Poly on this scholarship.

01:25:23.579 --> 01:25:28.292
- You wanna run that by me again?
- I want you to play football for me.

01:25:30.294 --> 01:25:33.506
- You're just doing this to feel better.
- I am.

01:25:33.672 --> 01:25:37.843
You're damn right.
I feel a hell of a lot better right now.

01:25:38.928 --> 01:25:40.596
Full scholarship, huh?

01:25:40.763 --> 01:25:45.810
Yeah. At one of the finest engineering
schools in the country. So sign it.

01:25:47.812 --> 01:25:52.483
Come on, Stef. Just sign it.
I love you. I want you to. Just sign it.

01:25:52.650 --> 01:25:54.777
What about you, Lis? Huh?

01:25:55.736 --> 01:25:56.862
Sign it.

01:25:58.531 --> 01:26:01.742
- Pop? Yeah?
Mmm.

01:26:01.951 --> 01:26:03.786
Hey, Kurowski!

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.123
You tell Bosko,
I'll be seeing him around.

01:26:15.506 --> 01:26:16.966
Thanks.

01:26:34.358 --> 01:26:36.318
Thanks.

01:26:36.610 --> 01:26:40.030
- Coach.
- No, thank you, Stef.

01:26:40.739 --> 01:26:43.576
But next time go for the ball, will you?

01:26:43.742 --> 01:26:45.286
Okay?

01:26:46.495 --> 01:26:47.830
Yes, sir.

01:26:47.997 --> 01:26:49.540
Thanks.

01:26:49.748 --> 01:26:54.587
- Yes, sir. Oh, babe!
All right!
