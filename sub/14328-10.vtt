{\an1}THANKS, MRS. BRADY--
I MEAN, MOM.

19:24.429 --> 19:26.431
WOW. YOUR MOM SURE IS
A LOT LESS SHRILL.

19:26.498 --> 19:29.368
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

19:29.434 --> 19:31.403
HEY, I'M FUNNY.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.506
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

19:34.573 --> 19:37.276
{\an1}OH, I LOVE MOM
AS A BLONDE.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.312
BUT WHAT'S WITH THE BRACEFACE
AND THE BALD KID?

19:42.014 --> 19:44.917
{\an4}Simon: SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BIG "T," BUT THE AUDIENCE
LOVES YOUR NEW MOM,

19:44.983 --> 19:47.085
SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP
MAKING CHANGES.

19:47.152 --> 19:48.353
THIS IS IT.

19:48.420 --> 19:51.256
GOOD-BYE, WANDA.
GOOD-BYE, TIMMY.

19:51.323 --> 19:53.392
A.J. AND CHESTER
GOT TO GO.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.394
WELL, IT'S
ABOUT TIME.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.662
{\an1}WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

19:56.728 --> 19:59.331
{\an1}THEY'RE MY BEST FRIENDS.
I HAPPEN TO LIKE THEM.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.700
BUT AS OUR RESEARCH
CLEARLY SHOWS,

20:01.767 --> 20:03.001
YOUR FANS DON'T.

20:03.068 --> 20:05.604
NOW MEET YOUR WACKY
NEW SIDEKICKS.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.007
EE! EE!

20:06.672 --> 20:09.007
EE! EE!

20:09.074 --> 20:11.743
AAH!

20:11.810 --> 20:13.478
YAAH!

20:13.545 --> 20:15.681
HELP!

20:15.747 --> 20:16.949
YAAH!

20:17.015 --> 20:19.051
OOH, HONEY, HAVE YOU
DONE SOMETHING NEW

20:19.117 --> 20:21.086
WITH YOUR HAIR,
FACE, AND BODY?

20:21.153 --> 20:22.821
AAH!

20:22.888 --> 20:24.790
AAH!

20:22.888 --> 20:24.790
AAH!

20:24.856 --> 20:27.392
GET TIMMY'S FRIENDS

20:27.459 --> 20:29.428
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

20:29.494 --> 20:33.599
All: WE LOVE "TIMMY TV"!

20:33.665 --> 20:35.200
HA HA HA!

20:35.267 --> 20:38.170
{\an1}I KNEW THE AUDIENCE WOULD
LOVE THOSE ADORABLE CHIMPS.

20:38.236 --> 20:40.572
CAN THIS SHOW GET
ANY MORE MASSIVE?

20:40.639 --> 20:41.873
IMPOSSIBLE.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.542
UNTHINKABLE.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.510
WRONG ANSWER.
YOU'RE FIRED.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.679
AAH!

20:45.577 --> 20:47.679
AAH!

20:47.746 --> 20:50.282
AS YOU CAN SEE, CHIMPS
SCORE HUGE WITH THE AUDIENCE,

20:50.349 --> 20:53.452
BUT WANDA AND COSMO,
I'M AFRAID, DO NOT.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.787
{\an1}WHAT? DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE THINKING

20:55.854 --> 20:58.090
{\an1}OF GETTING RID
OF COSMO AND WANDA.

20:58.156 --> 21:00.058
{\an1}YOU CAN'T JUST
SEPARATE US.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.760
AND YET, I CAN.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.429
{\an5}BIG "T" HERE
IS UNDER CONTRACT,
REMEMBER?

21:04.496 --> 21:08.133
{\an7}WOW. THE ONLY TIME
YOU SEE THE WORDS "TIMMY"
AND "CONTRACT" TOGETHER

21:08.200 --> 21:10.702
{\an8}IS IF YOU SEE THE PHRASE...

21:13.939 --> 21:17.242
{\an1}YOU CAN GET RID OF MY HAT,
MY MOM, AND MY BEST FRIENDS,

21:17.309 --> 21:19.478
{\an1}BUT YOU CAN'T GET RID
OF MY GODPARENTS.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.013
OH, DID YOU
HEAR THAT?

21:21.079 --> 21:23.281
HE REALLY
LOVES US.

21:23.348 --> 21:27.686
{\an4}I MEAN, WHO ELSE
IS GONNA POOF UP ICE CREAM
FOR ME ALL THE TIME?

21:27.753 --> 21:29.187
TOUGH TOENAILS,
BIG "T."

21:29.254 --> 21:31.023
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
WANTED TO BE FAMOUS.

21:31.089 --> 21:32.491
FAME HAS A PRICE.

21:32.557 --> 21:34.126
BESIDES,
IF I LET YOU WALK,

21:34.192 --> 21:37.996
{\an5}WHERE AM I GOING TO GET
A CRAZY, WACKY NEW STAR
TO FILL YOUR SHOES?

21:38.063 --> 21:44.136
{\an4}WHAT IF I COULD FIND
SOMEONE CRAZIER AND WACKIER
TO FILL MY SHOES?

21:44.202 --> 21:45.937
FINALLY, IT'S DONE!

21:46.004 --> 21:48.607
MY NEW AND IMPROVED
ULTRA FAIRY DETECTOR.

21:48.674 --> 21:52.444
{\an5}WITH IT,
I CAN'T HELP BUT FIND
FAIRY GODPARENTS!

21:52.511 --> 21:54.179
AND MAKE A DELICIOUS
FRUIT SMOOTHIE.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.881
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

21:55.947 --> 21:58.350
WHAT'S THAT?
LAUGHTER FROM NOWHERE?

21:58.417 --> 22:00.819
IT'S AN OBVIOUS SIGN
THAT EITHER INVISIBLE PEOPLE

22:00.886 --> 22:04.956
HAVE FINALLY COME TO RECOGNIZE
MY UNIQUE BRAND OF COMIC GENIUS

22:05.023 --> 22:08.026
OR, MORE LIKELY,
FAIRY GODPARENTS!

22:08.093 --> 22:10.162
EEK!

22:10.228 --> 22:12.064
All: FAIRY GODPARENTS!

22:12.130 --> 22:13.432
[CHEERING]

22:14.866 --> 22:16.301
{\an1}WHAT DID
I TELL YOU, SIMON?

22:16.368 --> 22:18.537
{\an1}IS CROCKER
A GIANT HIT, OR WHAT?

22:18.603 --> 22:21.707
{\an5}YOU'RE A NATURAL,
MY LITTLE
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER.

22:21.773 --> 22:24.443
{\an5}"CROCKER TV"
IS THE BIGGEST SHOW
WE'VE EVER HAD,

22:24.509 --> 22:25.877
AND YOUR
EPISODE IDEA

22:25.944 --> 22:28.613
{\an5}WHERE HE GETS EATEN
BY A HERD OF WILDEBEEST
IS GREAT.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.549
WANDA, COSMO,
NO HARD FEELINGS.

22:30.615 --> 22:33.685
{\an1}WHEN HE'S OFF THE SHOW,
CAN I HAVE HIS PART, PLEASE?

22:33.752 --> 22:34.853
PLEASE, PLEASE?

22:34.920 --> 22:37.789
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
GO WRONG?

22:37.856 --> 22:39.191
{\an8}LOTS OF THINGS.

22:39.257 --> 22:41.426
{\an7}NEVER LET YOUR MOM
BE YOUR MANAGER.

22:41.493 --> 22:43.195
{\an7}YOU'VE GOT
AN AUDITION.

22:43.261 --> 22:45.430
{\an7}TRY

22:45.497 --> 22:47.399
WAIT A MINUTE. MOM?

22:47.466 --> 22:49.501
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW
ANY OF YOU KIDS.

22:49.568 --> 22:51.670
