WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:03.530
Howdy!

00:03.710 --> 00:06.620
Welcome to the Thanksgiving
country jamboree!

00:06.650 --> 00:08.020
- Wow.
- We got the whole Dunphy clan,

00:08.050 --> 00:09.890
Claire, Phil, Luke, Alex and...

00:09.920 --> 00:13.390
Well, and who is this
happy farmhand?

00:13.420 --> 00:14.890
I'm Jerry.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.430
Jerry used to live next door.

00:16.460 --> 00:18.760
He's been going through a brutal
divorce for years,

00:18.790 --> 00:20.300
and he was gonna spend
Thanksgiving alone.

00:20.330 --> 00:21.970
Phil thought it'd be a good idea

00:22.000 --> 00:24.900
if he spent the day with
a happy, functional family.

00:24.930 --> 00:27.870
We couldn't find one,
so he's coming with us.

00:27.900 --> 00:28.940
So, where's Haley?

00:28.970 --> 00:30.240
She's with Rainer.

00:30.270 --> 00:32.080
They've been seeing a lot of
each other, which is great.

00:32.110 --> 00:33.480
Funny thing is,
he was my friend first,

00:33.510 --> 00:35.140
but now I never see him.
Or Haley.

00:35.170 --> 00:36.750
Phil.
It's what everybody's
thinking.

00:36.780 --> 00:38.280
I don't want people
walking on eggshells

00:38.310 --> 00:40.320
'cause he was my friend first,
but now I never see him.

00:40.350 --> 00:41.450
Or Haley.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.790
I'm only allowed to see
my children once a week.

00:43.820 --> 00:45.120
I hardly know them.

00:45.150 --> 00:47.160
Oh, well, Clark's
head of the math club,

00:47.190 --> 00:49.230
and Tina's turned
into a bit of a slut.

00:49.260 --> 00:50.890
Thanks for the update.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.660
- Okay, there they are!
- Hi!

00:53.690 --> 00:55.730
Don't y'all look as pretty
as a peach pie

00:55.760 --> 00:56.900
on a Sunday afternoon?

00:56.930 --> 00:58.130
For the love of God,

00:58.160 --> 00:59.770
this is the last thing
I need today.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.340
Hey, Flavor Flav, what's up
with the giant watch?

01:02.370 --> 01:04.239
It's my doctor being
a pain in the butt.

01:04.269 --> 01:05.910
One high reading,
I got this thing

01:05.940 --> 01:07.510
taking my blood pressure
all day.

01:07.540 --> 01:08.510
Wait, are you okay?

01:08.540 --> 01:09.850
No.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.580
He needs to quit cigars
and the terrible food.

01:11.610 --> 01:13.320
Last week,
I caught him in the garage

01:13.350 --> 01:14.650
eating a Polish sausage.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.450
What a man does
behind his water heater

01:16.480 --> 01:17.790
is his own business.

01:17.820 --> 01:19.190
Don't worry about it.
I've got it beat.

01:19.220 --> 01:20.290
Here's my trick.

01:20.320 --> 01:21.990
As soon as this thing goes off,

01:22.020 --> 01:24.190
I start singing
sweet '70s soft rock

01:24.220 --> 01:25.500
to mellow myself out.

01:25.530 --> 01:27.460
Those songs could do anything.

01:27.490 --> 01:29.130
Seals and Crofts came on,

01:29.160 --> 01:31.300
lady's bell bottoms came off.

01:32.330 --> 01:33.670
- Well...
- Hey, y'all.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.270
Anybody have a hankering
for a hush puppy?

01:35.300 --> 01:37.370
(device beeping)
Oh, geez.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.010
* Summer breeze

01:39.040 --> 01:41.450
* Makes me feel fine

01:41.480 --> 01:43.680
- What is going on here?
- * Blowing through the jas-

01:43.710 --> 01:45.110
It's a Thanksgiving jamboree!

01:45.140 --> 01:47.020
We have bales of hay.
We have a cider press.

01:47.050 --> 01:48.690
Ooh, we're even
deep-frying a turkey.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.790
And you're on board with this?

01:49.820 --> 01:51.860
Yes! Come on,
it's good country fun.

01:51.890 --> 01:52.960
No.

01:52.990 --> 01:54.860
For Cam, maybe.

01:54.890 --> 01:56.630
What is happening?
Is he hitting you?

01:56.660 --> 01:58.030
No.

01:58.060 --> 01:59.060
You did something, didn't you?

01:59.090 --> 02:00.300
You did!

02:00.330 --> 02:01.370
I didn't do anything.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.030
I'm...
I'm loving this, okay?

02:03.060 --> 02:04.170
Mm-hmm.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.070
(spittoon dings)
That takes practice.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.970
No, I am not leaving here
until you tell me what you did.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.470
Can I get you a mason jar
of Chardonnay?

02:10.500 --> 02:11.500
Giddy up.

02:13.210 --> 02:14.740
Mr. Student Council
President,

02:14.770 --> 02:16.880
have you had a chance to look
at my proposal

02:16.910 --> 02:19.250
updating the honor code to
address cyber-bullying?

02:19.280 --> 02:20.580
One second.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.520
(cellphone chimes)

02:25.080 --> 02:26.560
Why would you call me that?

02:26.590 --> 02:27.920
(chuckles)

02:27.950 --> 02:30.530
Luke somehow beat me in
the election for president,

02:30.560 --> 02:32.200
and I still can't get over it.

02:32.230 --> 02:34.700
Not to be hyperbolic,
but humans are a decade away

02:34.730 --> 02:36.500
from fighting apes on horseback.

02:36.530 --> 02:38.000
You're trying to tell me

02:38.030 --> 02:40.500
that there's absolutely nothing
weird going on here?

02:40.530 --> 02:41.710
You are dressed like a character

02:41.740 --> 02:43.010
out of
"It's Raining Mice and Men."

02:43.040 --> 02:44.270
I don't know what you're
talking about.

02:44.300 --> 02:47.180
I am enjoying this
more than a farm animal

02:47.210 --> 02:49.580
missing a limb engaged in...

02:49.610 --> 02:51.550
some sort of activity.

02:51.580 --> 02:52.580
Okay, I did something bad.

02:52.610 --> 02:53.720
I knew it.

02:53.750 --> 02:54.920
Yeah, yeah, something real bad.

02:54.950 --> 02:56.450
I need Cam in a good mood
before I tell him.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.890
Is it infidelity?
If feels like infidelity.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.790
- I can't say.
- Hey, Mitchell?

03:00.820 --> 03:03.430
It's your turn to feel
the burn on the churn!

03:03.460 --> 03:06.400
Well, then I "butter" (better)
get over there.

03:06.430 --> 03:08.230
(laughs)
Okay, come on!

03:08.260 --> 03:10.270
Hey, Dwight.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.700
Ma'am.

03:11.730 --> 03:13.470
So, did they just happen
to have this costume

03:13.500 --> 03:14.600
lying around in your size?

03:14.630 --> 03:16.040
Weirdly, they did.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.870
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, Dwight

03:17.900 --> 03:20.080
has one of the most important
games of his season next week

03:20.110 --> 03:21.580
and I can't have you
getting him sick.

03:21.610 --> 03:22.580
Yeah, I'm over the mono.

03:22.610 --> 03:23.750
But it could still be
contagious,

03:23.780 --> 03:25.750
and I have a fun
costume idea for you.

03:25.780 --> 03:28.050
How about being an old-timey
bank robber?

03:28.080 --> 03:31.760
You gotta cover that face
before the marshal gets to town.

03:31.790 --> 03:33.920
Hi!
Oh, what happened?

03:33.950 --> 03:36.230
Oh, nothing,
just a Korean laser peel.

03:36.260 --> 03:38.900
Hurt like hell, but once
the skin regenerates,

03:38.930 --> 03:41.100
it's gonna take 10 years off
these moneymakers.

03:41.130 --> 03:44.230
Hey! There she is.

03:44.260 --> 03:45.740
Thanks for dropping her off.

03:45.770 --> 03:48.440
Uh, actually, Rainer's daughter
is with her mom,

03:48.470 --> 03:50.740
so I invited him to spend
Thanksgiving with us.

03:50.770 --> 03:53.840
I am loving this country theme!

03:53.870 --> 03:56.280
This reminds me of when I worked
for Newscenter Twelve

03:56.310 --> 03:58.450
in Tulsa, except no one here's
bitter and drunk.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.680
(strained laughter)

03:59.710 --> 04:02.450
Gosh, I would hate for you
to feel weird, though,

04:02.480 --> 04:04.120
since this is just for family.

04:04.150 --> 04:05.690
Isn't that our old
neighbor, Jerry,

04:05.720 --> 04:07.320
stuffing appetizers
into a ziplock?

04:08.560 --> 04:11.360
You know what, Rainer? You are
more than welcome to stay.

04:11.390 --> 04:12.700
Thank you.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.860
Okay, well, I guess
the main thing

04:14.890 --> 04:16.170
is all the Dunphys are here.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.000
Hey, Rainer, what's the weather
going to be like for tomorrow?

04:18.029 --> 04:20.140
Clear and sunny skies,
highs in the mid 70s,

04:20.170 --> 04:21.839
but hang onto that umbrella
'cause Monday...

04:21.870 --> 04:23.540
Yeah, I just needed tomorrow,

04:23.570 --> 04:25.540
because that's when we're having
our big family football game.

04:25.570 --> 04:26.980
Remember last year?

04:27.010 --> 04:28.210
We ran that play?

04:28.240 --> 04:29.280
The Haley Mary?

04:29.310 --> 04:30.550
Uh, but tomorrow
we're supposed...

04:30.580 --> 04:32.380
To have sunny weather?
Yeah, you said that.

04:32.410 --> 04:34.620
Rainer's taking me to Cabo
for the weekend.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.120
So, I had a problem.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.620
I wasn't sure if my hairdryer

04:37.650 --> 04:39.990
ran on Mexican electricity.

04:40.020 --> 04:42.030
Oh, and telling my dad.

04:42.060 --> 04:43.630
I had two problems.

04:43.660 --> 04:46.160
**

04:56.500 --> 04:59.010
Doctors call it
"hysterical impotence."

04:59.040 --> 05:00.840
There's nothing physically
wrong, per se.

05:00.870 --> 05:02.380
But because of
my divorce trauma,

05:02.410 --> 05:04.050
I guess I'm rewired down there.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.480
I get it.

05:05.510 --> 05:06.650
Okay, city slickers,

05:06.680 --> 05:10.520
guess who has a genuine petting
zoo in the backyard?

05:10.550 --> 05:11.890
(device beeping)

05:11.920 --> 05:13.160
* Summer breeze

05:13.190 --> 05:15.530
* Makes me feel fine

05:15.560 --> 05:16.890
All right!

05:16.920 --> 05:19.200
(gasps) Wow!

05:19.230 --> 05:20.860
Animals!

05:20.890 --> 05:22.900
Oh, Cam, and you had
the scarecrow

05:22.930 --> 05:24.100
made to look like Mitch!

05:24.130 --> 05:26.870
No, no, no, no, my mom sent that
out from Missouri.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.070
I grew up with that.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.770
I even learned
how to dance with it.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.680
I guess, now that you mention
it, I do have a-a type.

05:31.710 --> 05:33.410
Hey, what's on this goat's head?

05:33.440 --> 05:34.740
That's my big idea...

05:34.770 --> 05:36.880
A camera to capture
everyone's delight!

05:36.910 --> 05:38.010
Guess what I call it.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.050
Goat-Pro?

05:39.080 --> 05:42.050
That's also
a... good name, yep.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.220
Look, Joe.
This is a goat.

05:45.250 --> 05:46.460
(goat bleating)

05:46.490 --> 05:48.220
Aah, I'm scared!

05:48.250 --> 05:50.460
No, no, no, there's nothing
to be scared of.

05:50.490 --> 05:52.760
That's the way he says,
"I love you."

05:52.790 --> 05:54.730
Of all the animals,
this one is the one

05:54.760 --> 05:58.470
that sounds the most like
an informant being tortured.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.400
I cannot have another son
that is afraid of animals.

06:01.430 --> 06:03.870
When Manny was 5,
he went to a petting zoo

06:03.900 --> 06:06.240
with a backpack
full of truffle popcorn.

06:06.270 --> 06:08.610
By the time they pulled
the pigs off him

06:08.640 --> 06:10.980
(voice breaking)
he was only wearing one sock.

06:11.010 --> 06:12.420
Joe, relax.

06:12.450 --> 06:15.120
Animals don't attack people
for no reason.

06:15.150 --> 06:16.920
Let go of me!
Oh, let go of me!

06:16.950 --> 06:19.060
Run, Jerry!
They do terrible things!
Shh!

06:19.090 --> 06:21.490
Ohh!

06:21.520 --> 06:23.330
Hey. Good news.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.800
The box of hair products
we pre-shipped has arrived

06:25.830 --> 06:27.500
and is waiting for us
at the resort.

06:27.530 --> 06:29.100
I don't care about
our hair anymore.

06:29.130 --> 06:30.930
Hey!
That's crazy talk.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.400
I still haven't gotten up
the guts to tell my parents.

06:33.430 --> 06:36.570
My mom will be cool,
but my dad is gonna freak out.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.610
Well, I'll tell him.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.410
Your dad and I are buds.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.850
And I am excellent at delivering
bad news with a smile.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.580
And that means the Coast Guard

06:44.610 --> 06:46.480
will be spending the holidays
with their families,

06:46.510 --> 06:49.320
because the search
has been called off.

06:49.350 --> 06:51.350
Wow, you're good.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.620
Phil. Hey.

06:53.650 --> 06:57.030
I know we haven't been spending
enough time together lately,

06:57.060 --> 07:01.460
but I scored this amazing villa
in Cabo for the weekend,

07:01.490 --> 07:03.470
and I wanted to take
a special someone.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.670
Listening.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.470
I know you have your big
family football game,

07:06.500 --> 07:08.100
but it's right on the water.

07:08.130 --> 07:10.040
Horseback riding on the beach.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.440
I see us both in white shirts.

07:11.470 --> 07:12.310
Phil.

07:12.340 --> 07:13.840
Claire, I know.

07:13.870 --> 07:16.050
It sounds like the best weekend
of my life, mi amigo,

07:16.080 --> 07:17.010
but I can't.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.180
It's family time.

07:18.210 --> 07:19.350
He wants to take Haley.

07:19.380 --> 07:20.450
Yeah.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.720
Did you think I was asking you?

07:21.750 --> 07:24.650
What... brother can't yank
a brother's chain?

07:24.680 --> 07:26.020
You trippin'?

07:26.050 --> 07:27.360
(laughs) This guy!

07:27.390 --> 07:28.320
(laughter)

07:28.350 --> 07:29.790
I'll send you some pictures.

07:29.820 --> 07:31.330
Okay.
But not from
the nude beach. Ooh!

07:31.360 --> 07:34.460
Oh, that's funny 'cause
it's my naked daughter!

07:34.490 --> 07:36.330
(voice breaking)
And you're taking her away!

07:36.360 --> 07:37.830
It's okay.

07:41.230 --> 07:43.540
See? They like it
when you pet them.

07:43.570 --> 07:45.310
And when you look
into their eyes,

07:45.340 --> 07:47.180
you can see that
they're very smart.

07:47.210 --> 07:49.550
They have a very deep soul.

07:49.580 --> 07:51.210
What's his name?

07:51.240 --> 07:53.580
Name? It's a goat.
Just touch it.

07:53.610 --> 07:56.590
I know it's a bummer,
Haley going to Cabo.

07:56.620 --> 07:59.320
I wouldn't salt those
margarita glasses just yet.

07:59.350 --> 08:02.330
Once I remind her how much fun
Thanksgiving weekend is here,

08:02.360 --> 08:04.030
she's not going anywhere.

08:04.060 --> 08:06.600
Well, I hope it goes better
than your big presentation

08:06.630 --> 08:09.030
on why the Ice Capades
were cooler than Coachella.

08:11.060 --> 08:12.700
Hey, honey.
Hi.

08:12.730 --> 08:15.540
I heard you had some tentative
travel plans.

08:15.570 --> 08:17.740
Actually, we just checked in
for our flight online.

08:17.770 --> 08:19.410
Thanks for being so cool
about this.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.870
Of course. Mmm.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.110
Potable water.

08:24.140 --> 08:25.610
(chuckles)
We take this stuff

08:25.640 --> 08:27.220
for granted stateside, don't we?

08:27.250 --> 08:29.720
It's a five-star resort.
I'm sure we'll be fine.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.220
(sniffs)
Smell those side dishes.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.690
They're gonna be
even better tomorrow

08:32.720 --> 08:33.890
at the post-game picnic.

08:33.919 --> 08:34.860
You know what's not a picnic?

08:34.890 --> 08:36.130
Putting on your bedroom slipper

08:36.159 --> 08:37.789
and getting an ankle full
of scorpion.

08:37.820 --> 08:39.429
Thanks, Dad.
I'll take my chances.

08:39.460 --> 08:41.130
That's what you said
about Coachella,

08:41.159 --> 08:43.070
and you missed Kristi Yamaguchi
doing a triple twist lift

08:43.100 --> 08:44.900
with Jiminy Cricket.

08:45.970 --> 08:48.040
(clears throat)
What?

08:48.070 --> 08:50.440
You are not allowed to eat those
with your blood pressure.

08:50.470 --> 08:52.310
Don't worry. These chips won't
show up for a couple of weeks,

08:52.340 --> 08:53.740
and by then
I'll have switched doctors.

08:53.770 --> 08:55.880
Sorry, Gloria's orders.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.550
Hey, Jay, looks like you could
use a little square dance.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.880
That would be about the last...

08:59.910 --> 09:01.650
* Ho, grab your partner,
swing 'em 'round *

09:01.680 --> 09:03.320
* Put on your best suit
and go to town *

09:03.350 --> 09:04.490
Cam, why are you...

09:04.520 --> 09:05.820
* Eat some corn
and ride a horse *

09:05.850 --> 09:07.420
* Are we having fun?
Why, yes, of course! *

09:07.450 --> 09:08.560
That's it!
I'm out of here!

09:08.590 --> 09:09.790
Huh?

09:09.820 --> 09:11.490
I need some aspirin.
I'm going to a pharmacy.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.600
I'm coming, too.
No reason.

09:13.630 --> 09:15.800
Apparently, you don't need
a reason to leave your family.

09:15.830 --> 09:18.700
I'll go, too.
I'm out of Ramen and Xanax.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.640
What's happening?

09:21.670 --> 09:23.470
This is what we
in the weather game

09:23.500 --> 09:25.440
refer to as a
"high-pressure system."

09:27.610 --> 09:29.350
(churning)

09:29.380 --> 09:30.750
This reminds me of the time

09:30.780 --> 09:32.180
I walked in on you
watching "Top Gun".

09:32.210 --> 09:34.020
You need to stop
telling that story.

09:34.050 --> 09:37.150
Whatever you did to Cam,
it can't have been that bad.

09:37.180 --> 09:39.160
And it is not worth this.

09:39.190 --> 09:41.590
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm worrying too much.

09:41.620 --> 09:42.630
You are.

09:42.660 --> 09:44.860
I gave Cam's Fizbo costume away.

09:44.890 --> 09:46.860
Oh, my God, he's gonna kill
everyone in the house.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.800
The truck was here,
and there were so many boxes,

09:48.830 --> 09:51.170
and you know how excited
I get about a deduction.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.470
Listen to me.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.270
He's not going to believe
that this was an accident.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.670
You can never, ever tell him.

09:56.700 --> 09:57.870
He's gonna know it's missing.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.610
I mean, he pulls it out
for everything.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.880
Birthday parties, brunches,
hot yoga...

10:01.910 --> 10:03.680
Blah.
Mm-hmm.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.050
I-I need to wait
for the right moment.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.620
There's never gonna be
a right moment.

10:06.650 --> 10:09.490
Hey, ain't nothing in the world
that can get me down

10:09.520 --> 10:11.150
when I'm holding
a little piglet.

10:11.180 --> 10:12.190
Look at her!

10:12.220 --> 10:14.120
It's time.
Sweetie?
Don't do it.

10:14.150 --> 10:15.520
Don't do it.
Don't do what?

10:15.550 --> 10:17.390
I need you to sit down for this.

10:17.420 --> 10:18.390
Take a bale.

10:18.420 --> 10:19.660
Think of the children.

10:19.690 --> 10:21.400
Lily, Dwight.

10:21.430 --> 10:23.230
Um...

10:23.260 --> 10:26.070
I gave Fizbo away.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.500
(piglet snorts)

10:29.270 --> 10:30.540
What?

10:30.570 --> 10:32.180
I know how much that costume
meant to you,

10:32.210 --> 10:35.710
and I am so, so sorry.

10:35.740 --> 10:37.910
Well, it's a lot to process.

10:37.940 --> 10:40.880
I know.
Accidents do happen.

10:40.910 --> 10:42.890
And I am holding
a little piglet.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.390
(chuckles)

10:44.420 --> 10:46.220
I forgive you.

10:46.250 --> 10:50.190
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a turkey to deep fry.

10:50.220 --> 10:51.590
Here.
Hold Connor.

10:51.620 --> 10:54.090
No, I (mutters) Okay.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.500
I married the sweetest,

10:57.530 --> 10:59.000
most understanding man
on the planet.

10:59.030 --> 11:01.340
Or he's done something
even worse to you

11:01.370 --> 11:03.010
and wants to get you
in a good mood.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.370
(scoffs) No.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.700
Yes!

11:08.140 --> 11:09.450
Hey!

11:09.480 --> 11:10.950
You don't have to
cover your face.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.780
I don't care what Coach Cam
says about mono.

11:12.810 --> 11:14.250
You're way too pretty.

11:14.280 --> 11:16.390
Oh, no. (laughs)

11:16.420 --> 11:18.090
I mean, listen, I'm flattered,

11:18.120 --> 11:24.090
but even though you are
so, so tall (chuckles)

11:24.120 --> 11:26.560
you are in high school
and I'm...

11:26.590 --> 11:27.560
Very beautiful.

11:27.590 --> 11:28.600
(laughs)

11:28.630 --> 11:30.230
Well...

11:30.260 --> 11:33.440
I was going to say,
"in college," but thanks.

11:33.470 --> 11:34.600
(laughs)

11:34.630 --> 11:36.870
Stop it, oh, my God!

11:36.900 --> 11:38.370
Ugh! Dad is killing me.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.140
He's trying to guilt trip me
out of going to Cabo.

11:40.170 --> 11:41.910
When is he gonna let me
live my own life?

11:41.940 --> 11:43.380
Maybe when you stop living
out of his basement

11:43.410 --> 11:44.610
and eating all of his food.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.810
You're right.
I am a victim.

11:49.180 --> 11:51.320
I should get this tiny mouthwash
for Haley.

11:51.350 --> 11:53.820
It's the abandon-your-family
travel size.

11:53.850 --> 11:55.260
Oh, dear God.

11:55.290 --> 11:57.890
I know... Corn Nuts,
two-for-one sale.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.300
I feel like God's giving me
the middle finger.

12:00.330 --> 12:04.730
No. That's my wife's
divorce lawyer.

12:04.760 --> 12:05.900
I can't believe it.

12:05.930 --> 12:07.900
That bastard was my ex's lawyer.

12:07.930 --> 12:09.770
- Are you kidding me?
- Whoa.

12:09.800 --> 12:13.010
I bet he's here to buy
some extra-small condoms,

12:13.040 --> 12:15.980
the kind that they keep
behind the counter.

12:16.010 --> 12:17.910
Shut up.

12:17.940 --> 12:19.850
I keep having this dream
that he's dying of thirst

12:19.880 --> 12:21.520
in the desert,
and I hit him with my car.

12:21.550 --> 12:23.420
- I thought you were over it.
- I thought I was.

12:23.450 --> 12:25.420
Let's get out of here
before my cuff explodes.

12:25.450 --> 12:27.290
Yeah, he already ruined
my family.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.660
I don't want him to ruin
my Thanksgiving, too.

12:30.890 --> 12:33.030
No.

12:33.060 --> 12:35.100
We're not going anywhere.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.370
It's time someone stood up

12:36.400 --> 12:38.130
to the weasels who sweep
into our lives,

12:38.160 --> 12:40.640
break up our families,
and take our loved ones to Cabo.

12:40.670 --> 12:43.040
I feel like you're making this
about you, but you're right.

12:43.070 --> 12:45.140
Do you know when my high
blood pressure started?

12:45.170 --> 12:46.710
When I met that guy.

12:46.740 --> 12:48.710
Is this when someone's supposed
to say, "Get him!"

12:48.740 --> 12:49.980
- No.
- You hold him down.

12:50.010 --> 12:51.680
I'm gonna beat him
with this orthopedic shoe.

12:51.710 --> 12:52.850
Come here!

12:52.880 --> 12:55.180
Let's not lock into
our... our first idea.

12:55.210 --> 12:57.190
I love you, Mr. Goat!

12:57.220 --> 12:58.720
Aw, you see, Joe?

12:58.750 --> 13:01.020
You listen to Mommy, and now
you have a new best friend.

13:01.050 --> 13:02.390
(goat bleats)

13:02.420 --> 13:03.360
What?

13:03.390 --> 13:04.390
(goat bleats)

13:04.420 --> 13:06.300
You're cold?
I'll go get you a blanket!

13:06.330 --> 13:07.530
(laughter)

13:07.560 --> 13:09.170
Well, if he was going to get
the pig a blanket,

13:09.200 --> 13:10.400
you know what that
would be called.

13:10.430 --> 13:12.670
Pig in a blanket?
Okay, I teed that one up
for you.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.240
All right,
it's time to fry this turkey.

13:14.270 --> 13:16.370
Somebody please lower
my splatter goggles, boys?

13:16.400 --> 13:17.340
You heard him.

13:17.370 --> 13:18.640
You do it.

13:18.670 --> 13:20.480
You're not the president
of goggle lowering.

13:20.510 --> 13:23.080
I would be if they took a vote.

13:23.110 --> 13:26.320
What could Cam have done?
(gasps)

13:26.350 --> 13:27.880
Maybe he's the one
who's having an affair.

13:27.910 --> 13:30.550
I saw a list of clues
in a magazine.

13:30.580 --> 13:33.660
Has he joined a gym or bought
sexy new underwear recently?

13:33.690 --> 13:35.420
I think it's sweet
that you think

13:35.450 --> 13:39.230
we're capable of having an
affair, but we're just so tired.

13:39.260 --> 13:40.730
All right, now, boys,

13:40.760 --> 13:44.130
the key is you drop it
nice and gentle like.

13:46.570 --> 13:47.740
Mono! (screams)

13:47.770 --> 13:49.410
(goat bleats)

13:49.440 --> 13:50.610
Runaway goat!

13:50.640 --> 13:51.570
(goat bleats)

13:51.600 --> 13:53.280
Ay!

13:53.310 --> 13:56.640
Aw, you wanted to run
to the barn!

13:57.980 --> 13:59.120
Aw!

13:59.150 --> 14:02.050
Let me put a positive spin
on this.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.120
Who here likes goat?

14:08.290 --> 14:09.790
Hello, you son of a bitch.

14:09.820 --> 14:12.600
Hope you like that deodorant,
'cause you stink!

14:12.630 --> 14:13.930
Wart remover...

14:13.960 --> 14:15.260
Well, if that works,
there'll be nothing left.

14:15.290 --> 14:17.700
Well, well, well.
Norbert and Pritchett.

14:17.730 --> 14:19.440
Jay, I don't think
I ever got a chance

14:19.470 --> 14:21.570
to thank you for buying me
my first Ferrari.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.910
I wish you drove it off a cliff.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.140
Like the one my house is on,

14:24.170 --> 14:25.640
which you also paid for,
thank you?

14:25.670 --> 14:26.980
(chortles)

14:27.010 --> 14:28.910
This doesn't sound like
we're getting him.

14:28.940 --> 14:30.650
Look, you want some
free legal advice, fellas?

14:30.680 --> 14:34.080
Three words...
Ladies. Leave. Losers.

14:34.110 --> 14:36.490
No, sir, we have three words
for you.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.390
Have you no sh...
Have you...

14:38.420 --> 14:41.960
Have no... have you no shame...
It can be four words.

14:41.990 --> 14:43.060
Who's this chuckle-head?

14:43.090 --> 14:44.630
Someone who you're never
gonna know,

14:44.660 --> 14:47.060
'cause I'm happily married
most of the time.

14:47.090 --> 14:48.600
Aw, that's what they all say.

14:48.630 --> 14:50.930
Then one day your wife wakes up
and says, "Oh, my God!

14:50.960 --> 14:52.340
I married a moron!"

14:52.370 --> 14:55.670
She calls me, and I'm like,
"Hello, Mrs. Chuckle..."

14:55.700 --> 14:57.010
(basket thuds)

14:57.040 --> 14:58.170
(grunting)

14:59.940 --> 15:01.980
(device beeping)

15:02.010 --> 15:03.680
Yeah, that's about right.

15:09.650 --> 15:11.020
He might have had
a heart attack.

15:11.050 --> 15:12.360
We probably ought
to do something.

15:12.390 --> 15:13.860
Oh, I saw some champagne
back there.

15:13.890 --> 15:15.320
It's the guy on the ground!

15:15.350 --> 15:18.460
Oh! Take the defibrillator,
I'll call 911.

15:18.490 --> 15:19.800
Guys, help me out.
I don't know what I'm doing.

15:19.830 --> 15:21.330
I watch a lot of
"Grey's Anatomy,"

15:21.360 --> 15:23.370
but I fast-forward through
the non-romantic scenes.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.830
No, no, no, we're not
gonna save him!

15:24.860 --> 15:26.200
Jerry, no, Jerry.

15:26.230 --> 15:27.500
Jay, get him off me!

15:27.530 --> 15:30.440
Look at his basket.
Wasn't much of a life.

15:30.470 --> 15:32.140
(electricity surges)
Ohh!

15:34.410 --> 15:36.550
Ah, hell, I'm gonna regret this.

15:36.580 --> 15:38.010
(groans)

15:38.040 --> 15:40.380
I'm feeling better, Pritchett.
I think it was just gas.

15:40.410 --> 15:41.720
Better safe than sorry.
(defibrillator powers up)

15:41.750 --> 15:43.650
Aah!

15:43.680 --> 15:46.120
Oh, I deserve some of the blame.

15:46.150 --> 15:48.290
I made my farmscape
too inviting.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.890
Okay.
This is a mess.

15:50.920 --> 15:51.990
What are we gonna do now?

15:52.020 --> 15:54.130
Alex, how many goats have to die

15:54.160 --> 15:56.700
until you get a handle
on your insatiable appetite

15:56.730 --> 15:57.970
for high-school boys?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.570
Actually, I-it's my fault.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.370
Ooh, Dwight.
We're good-looking guys.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.310
We don't apologize for it.

16:03.340 --> 16:05.140
I got you a blanket,
Mr. Goat.

16:05.170 --> 16:06.580
No, no, no, no, no!

16:06.610 --> 16:09.080
We're going to wait for
Santa Claus by the chimney!

16:09.110 --> 16:10.580
But it's Thanksgiving.

16:10.610 --> 16:12.820
What about Mr. Goat?

16:12.850 --> 16:14.820
How come I don't
hear him anymore?

16:14.850 --> 16:17.320
Ay, Mr. Goat is fine!

16:17.350 --> 16:18.750
Baaa!

16:18.780 --> 16:20.260
Did you hear that?

16:20.290 --> 16:22.020
What is it, Mr. Goat?

16:22.050 --> 16:23.390
Baaa!

16:23.420 --> 16:26.260
He's saying that he needs
some time alone.

16:26.290 --> 16:28.730
Look, there's some cookies
for Santa.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.830
Here, why don't you go and sit
by the chimney and wait.

16:30.860 --> 16:33.240
Santa!

16:33.270 --> 16:36.870
Hey lookit, it's not my place
to try to parent your kids.

16:36.900 --> 16:37.870
Good.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.840
But one thing we learn
on the farm

16:39.870 --> 16:42.610
is that death is a part of life.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.080
If you tell Joe what happened
to that goat,

16:44.110 --> 16:45.850
death is gonna be part
of your life.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.720
You know what? Kids can handle
a lot more than you think.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.250
And every step,
from birth till the end,

16:51.280 --> 16:53.690
has its own magical beauty.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.290
So, do we jam the goat
in the garbage

16:55.320 --> 16:56.930
or heave it over the fence?

16:56.960 --> 16:58.560
Teach your children well.

16:58.590 --> 17:01.530
Hey.
Thanks for before.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.430
You know, pushing me out
of the way of the goat.

17:03.460 --> 17:04.470
Don't worry about it.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.270
It's more about protecting
the office.

17:06.300 --> 17:09.410
Look, I think we both know
you should have been president.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.740
Maybe I've been hard on you
'cause I'm jealous.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.910
GLORIA: Yeah, okay.

17:14.940 --> 17:18.079
You two keep making out
while I carry the dead goat.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.160
Mr. Goat?

17:27.190 --> 17:29.890
(weakly) Baaaa?

17:29.920 --> 17:32.560
Any suspicious activity
on that phone bill?

17:32.590 --> 17:34.660
Well, Cam spent $100
on the psychic hotline...
(gasps)

17:34.690 --> 17:37.130
but that's normal during
the run-up to awards season.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.600
- Oh.
- Hey.

17:38.630 --> 17:40.300
I just saw we were running out
of pumpkin dip,

17:40.330 --> 17:42.170
and I know it's your favorite,
so I brought you some.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.310
What's your game?

17:43.340 --> 17:44.670
Yeah,
show us your underwear.
What?

17:44.700 --> 17:47.240
Hm.
Why were you so understanding
about Fizbo, huh?

17:47.270 --> 17:48.280
What are you hiding?

17:48.310 --> 17:49.650
- Hiding?
- Mm-hmm.

17:49.680 --> 17:50.910
Shame on you.

17:50.940 --> 17:52.450
It's Thanksgiving.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.150
I want to celebrate
with my husband,

17:54.180 --> 17:57.820
my daughter,
my lovely family, Jerry.

17:57.850 --> 18:00.260
I think it's sad
that you two look at life

18:00.290 --> 18:01.660
as some sort of game
where everyone's trying

18:01.690 --> 18:03.360
to get away with something.

18:03.390 --> 18:05.490
Some people are just nice.

18:07.460 --> 18:08.600
They bought it.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.330
Truth is, I paid
for the jamboree

18:10.360 --> 18:13.970
with money we had saved for
a romantic Hawaiian vacation.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.170
I even sprung for fancy straw
bales flown in from Missouri.

18:17.200 --> 18:21.310
(sniffs)
Ohh. That's class.

18:24.210 --> 18:25.710
The hell happened here?

18:25.740 --> 18:28.620
(groans) I think I felt enough
for one day.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.020
- Ohh!
- Oh!

18:30.050 --> 18:33.120
It's possible I've been
electrocuted one too many times.

18:33.150 --> 18:35.220
You know,
I learned something today.

18:35.250 --> 18:38.790
I saw a man nearly die
right in front of me.

18:38.820 --> 18:41.230
And this is a constant reminder

18:41.260 --> 18:43.030
that it can happen to me
at any moment.

18:43.060 --> 18:45.070
It's a lot to think about.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.230
So I'm not gonna.

18:48.370 --> 18:49.640
Phil, get me a beer.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.470
Jerry, get me a scotch.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.340
I learned something today, too.

18:53.370 --> 18:55.910
It's a lot right now, Jerry.

18:58.880 --> 18:59.880
(groans)

18:59.910 --> 19:01.320
Hey.

19:01.350 --> 19:03.320
What's the matter, kid?

19:03.350 --> 19:05.190
I loved Mr. Goat.

19:05.220 --> 19:07.220
He died.
Ohh.

19:07.250 --> 19:08.660
Please don't smoke.

19:08.690 --> 19:13.660
Hey, don't you worry
about a thing, Joey.

19:13.690 --> 19:15.730
I'm not going anywhere.

19:19.530 --> 19:22.170
(grunting)

19:22.200 --> 19:24.410
Dad, I don't care what you say.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.540
I'm going to Cabo.

19:25.570 --> 19:26.440
You sure are.

19:26.470 --> 19:27.610
Sure are gonna get kidnapped

19:27.640 --> 19:29.410
by Aztecs and sacrificed
in a volcano.

19:29.440 --> 19:32.010
I get it.
No, honey, I want you to go.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.080
I-I'm sorry about earlier.
I was mad.

19:35.110 --> 19:36.950
And instead of talking about it,

19:36.980 --> 19:39.760
I pushed it down and it came out
in some ugly ways

19:39.790 --> 19:43.320
with my beautiful daughter
and a lawyer who has warts.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.630
Anyway, it's just
more and more of your life

19:46.660 --> 19:49.300
is happening away from me,
and it's normal and good,

19:49.330 --> 19:50.600
but it's hard.

19:50.630 --> 19:52.640
Damn it, why do you have
to be so sweet?

19:52.670 --> 19:53.800
Now I feel guilty.

19:53.830 --> 19:56.270
Don't. Go to Cabo.
Have fun.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.210
You know,
I could play football today.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.710
Run that Haley Mary?

19:59.740 --> 20:01.240
That would be so wonderful...

20:01.270 --> 20:03.210
Oh!
Ow!

20:03.240 --> 20:06.140
Electrocuted again?
Real bad.

20:07.510 --> 20:10.320
- Okay, break!
- All right, everybody.

20:10.350 --> 20:13.390
Welcome to the 15th annual
Thanksgiving football game,

20:13.420 --> 20:15.460
being played a day early.

20:15.490 --> 20:17.160
I'd be remiss
if I didn't mention

20:17.190 --> 20:19.330
how beautiful it is that
we're all together.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.100
Is it just me,
or can you feel the love...

20:22.130 --> 20:23.230
Can we please do this?

20:23.260 --> 20:26.000
- All right.
- Down!

20:26.030 --> 20:27.170
Set.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.940
Phil, we're good, right?
Oh, we're great.

20:28.970 --> 20:30.510
You should really take Claire
to this resort.

20:30.540 --> 20:31.440
Very romantic.

20:31.470 --> 20:32.940
Blue, 39!

20:32.970 --> 20:34.840
Heart-shaped Jacuzzi
in every room.

20:34.870 --> 20:37.310
Kansas City, Kansas City...

20:37.340 --> 20:38.480
(grunts)

20:38.510 --> 20:41.620
(sighs)
Actually, now I'm great.

20:41.650 --> 20:43.820
Oh, my God, Dad.
Seriously?

20:43.850 --> 20:46.090
Ahh.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.020
Ah, what a beautiful day.

20:51.990 --> 20:53.930
Oh, I am exhausted.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.830
I'm counting down the days
till we're in Hawaii.

20:56.860 --> 20:58.600
Sweetie, I don't know
if you can count that high.

20:58.630 --> 21:00.600
You remember how cool I was
with the whole Fizbo thing?

21:00.630 --> 21:03.040
Cam, you spent the Hawaii money
on this party, didn't you?

21:03.070 --> 21:05.210
What is wrong with us?

21:05.240 --> 21:06.940
From now on, can we just be
honest with each other,

21:06.970 --> 21:08.210
all right?
No more games.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.440
Deal.

21:09.470 --> 21:11.110
Hey, daddies.
You look tired.

21:11.140 --> 21:12.980
I made you some
grilled cheese sandwiches.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.620
Love you.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.120
Well, there's something
we did right.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.220
Yeah.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.950
I needed them in a good mood.

21:18.980 --> 21:20.990
I kept this
from the petting zoo.

21:21.020 --> 21:22.420
