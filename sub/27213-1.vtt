00:43.085 --> 00:46.765
Once upon a Christmas,
a long time ago,

00:46.845 --> 00:51.165
a young man saw a gift,
but had pockets full of snow.

00:51.845 --> 00:55.645
So he took up his tools
and he worked night and day,

00:56.205 --> 00:59.485
made the most perfect toy,
then he gave it away.

01:00.125 --> 01:03.805
That little horse saved Christmas
in the winter before,

01:04.845 --> 01:08.125
but now it may need
to save it once more.

01:12.445 --> 01:14.725
Last one to the beach
is a Christmas pudding!

01:15.325 --> 01:16.685
Come on, Becky!

01:16.765 --> 01:18.325
Whee!

01:31.805 --> 01:35.525
It's Christmas on the island,
so obviously we're hitting the beach.

01:35.805 --> 01:39.325
Sand, sea, and Santa:
that's how we do the season around here.

01:43.605 --> 01:46.765
- Zoe's first English Christmas.
- We're so happy to have you here.

01:46.845 --> 01:50.405
Thanks for the sweater Becky,
but it is way colder than LA.

01:50.885 --> 01:52.885
- Feeling homesick yet?
- A little.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.405
It's weird being without my family, but…

01:55.645 --> 01:58.165
I had to stay for Raven.
Anyways, it's cool.

01:58.245 --> 02:01.285
I'm gonna make the perfect Christmas
for me and my grandpa.

02:01.365 --> 02:04.765
I'm thinking lights, decorations,
some eggnog…

02:04.845 --> 02:06.805
- Egg-what?
- You're going to love it.

02:08.205 --> 02:10.925
Come on, you know my grandpa
literally has one decoration.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.965
Sounds like he needs our help.

02:24.485 --> 02:26.325
- Hi, Frank.
- Hiya, Frank!

02:27.085 --> 02:29.165
- What's all that?
- Oh, wow.

02:29.725 --> 02:31.365
Okay. This…

02:31.525 --> 02:33.925
This is worse than I… thought.

02:36.285 --> 02:38.245
Serious case of tinsel-itus.

02:38.445 --> 02:40.405
And there's only one thing for it.

02:41.365 --> 02:43.765
Ladies, decorations stations.

02:44.485 --> 02:46.125
What are you lot up to?

02:46.565 --> 02:49.085

03:41.565 --> 03:45.165
Right, well, we better get to the stables.
It's nearly Christmas showtime.

03:45.245 --> 03:46.885
- You're coming, right, Frank?
- Wouldn't miss it.

03:47.445 --> 03:49.165
- See you guys there.
- See you in a bit.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.765
Oh, we forgot one more decoration.

03:55.565 --> 03:58.525
This is beautiful, Grandpa.
Where'd you get it?

03:58.605 --> 04:01.245
Someone made it for me a long time ago.

04:01.525 --> 04:03.845
Sadly, there's no more room on that tree.
Oh, well.

04:03.925 --> 04:05.325
Well, we'll make room.

04:06.805 --> 04:08.245
There. Perfect.

04:08.685 --> 04:10.125
No!

04:13.485 --> 04:16.125
Oh, Grandpa! I'm so sorry.

04:16.485 --> 04:18.204
Why am I so clumsy?

04:18.285 --> 04:21.285
It's okay. It doesn't matter now anyway.

04:21.725 --> 04:23.845
So… more mince pies?

04:33.445 --> 04:34.925
I'll make this right, Grandpa.

04:35.805 --> 04:36.645
I promise.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.405
Thank you. See you there!

04:54.605 --> 04:55.725
Roll up!

04:55.805 --> 04:58.365
There's still time to get tickets
to the Bright Fields Christmas show!

04:58.445 --> 05:00.925
You've hardly got any left.
You must have sold loads!

05:01.005 --> 05:03.925
Well, Bob ate most of them,
but there's still time to sell out.

05:15.485 --> 05:16.725
Who is that?

05:16.805 --> 05:18.085
Mia's dad's new girlfriend.

05:18.165 --> 05:19.525
I heard she's a model.

05:19.725 --> 05:22.725
Do you need help, darling?
I could drop some invites off in town.

05:22.805 --> 05:25.445
- Oh, that would be…
- Dear, the shops will be opening soon.

05:26.565 --> 05:28.285
…totally not required.

05:28.725 --> 05:30.885
It's fine, Daddy.
I got it all under control,

05:30.965 --> 05:32.325
but I'll see you later?

05:32.405 --> 05:33.485
Bye.

05:41.565 --> 05:44.165
He's taking her shopping.
He must really like her.

05:46.845 --> 05:50.005
Gaby! I need you
to muck out Firefly's stable,

05:50.085 --> 05:52.645
and when you're done,
could you clean out his feed bucket

05:52.725 --> 05:54.725
and fill up his haynet. Thanks.

05:55.245 --> 05:57.365
I work for the yard, not for you.

05:58.485 --> 06:01.605
Well, actually, while Pin's traveling,
I'm in charge.

06:01.685 --> 06:03.565
Not technically true.

06:04.845 --> 06:07.245
And I just don't have the time
for menial tasks.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.365
In case you hadn't noticed,

06:08.445 --> 06:10.805
It's my family's
famous Mistletoe Ball tonight.

06:11.685 --> 06:15.245
And I'd just really appreciate help
from our new stable hand.

06:16.085 --> 06:18.925
Don't you find it ironic how you came here
pretending to be a cleaner

06:19.005 --> 06:20.765
and now you basically are one?

06:21.605 --> 06:23.045
So let me get this straight.

06:23.125 --> 06:25.845
Your dad was too poor
to rebuild the stables,

06:25.925 --> 06:28.845
but all of a sudden,
he can throw some massive party.

06:28.925 --> 06:31.005
He's not throwing it. Mia is.

06:32.405 --> 06:33.645
No, I see.

06:33.885 --> 06:35.965
You're making sure
Daddy doesn't forget you

06:36.045 --> 06:37.645
now he's got a shiny new girlfriend.

06:40.045 --> 06:41.045
Awkward.

06:41.645 --> 06:44.765
Like I said, I work for the yard.
Not for you.

06:49.405 --> 06:50.365
Ta-da!

06:50.445 --> 06:54.445
And then I'll say, "Thank you everyone for
coming to our Bright Fields festive show.

06:54.525 --> 06:56.845
Merry Christmas and a Horsey New Year!"

06:58.525 --> 07:00.885
That is so clever.

07:01.285 --> 07:03.365
Brilliant. Horsey New Year?

07:04.325 --> 07:05.485
Are you…

07:07.445 --> 07:09.245
- me?
- No.

07:09.485 --> 07:11.525
I'm Winnie. Like the sound a horse makes.

07:12.045 --> 07:14.365
- I used to have a jumper like that.
- It's yours.

07:14.645 --> 07:16.725
I bought your old clothes
from a charity shop.

07:17.005 --> 07:19.525
- Becky has a super fan.
- And Bob.

07:19.725 --> 07:21.205
I love them both equally.

07:22.205 --> 07:23.685
Well, nice to meet you, Winnie.

07:23.765 --> 07:25.965
Welcome to the yard.
But if you'll excuse us,

07:26.045 --> 07:27.765
we have a show to organize.

07:28.005 --> 07:30.965
- We still have to sort out lighting…
- Me! Pick me!

07:31.045 --> 07:32.445
- I love lighting.
- I'm not sure…

07:32.525 --> 07:35.565
- You know, when it's all light and stuff.
- You've got the gig!

07:35.645 --> 07:37.685
- I want you to think big.

07:37.765 --> 07:39.245
- If I may speak…
- Think…

07:39.325 --> 07:41.845
So gigantic you can see it from Mars?

07:42.485 --> 07:44.005
- You've got it.
- I think less is more.

07:44.085 --> 07:45.445
And less is less expensive.

07:46.005 --> 07:47.645
Right. Of course.

07:47.725 --> 07:49.765
- You hear that, guys?
- Yes, Producer Jade.

07:54.445 --> 07:55.965
I had my fingers crossed.

07:56.045 --> 07:57.165
What do you mean?

07:57.525 --> 08:00.125
I'm going to make
Becky's dreams a reality.

08:01.885 --> 08:03.565
Easy, boy.

08:03.965 --> 08:05.365
He'll be here in a minute.

08:09.925 --> 08:12.565
- Hey, sorry. My train was delayed.
- No worries.

08:12.645 --> 08:14.605
- How are you?
- Good. Let's go.

08:14.685 --> 08:18.285
Cheers for this. Mia will kill me if we
don't make it back in time for her ball.

08:18.605 --> 08:20.125
Luckily, I've never missed one.

08:22.565 --> 08:23.925
Zoe's got no idea you're coming home?

08:24.405 --> 08:26.005
Nope. Thought I'd surprise her.

08:26.085 --> 08:27.365
She's gonna go nuts.

08:28.045 --> 08:31.125
She won't be the only one.
The Duke is coming back to the island.

08:31.205 --> 08:34.005
- Yeah, yeah.
- They'll be rolling out the red carpet,

08:34.085 --> 08:36.605
hoisting the flag,
and polishing the Duke mobile.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.125
That's enough.

08:42.044 --> 08:43.445
Are you guys headed South?

08:44.164 --> 08:46.565
Well, all the buses are full
and I've got a kid's party to get to.

08:46.645 --> 08:48.765
- Sorry mate, we're kinda in a rush.
- Jump in.

08:48.845 --> 08:50.485
Oh. Thanks!

08:51.805 --> 08:52.845
What?

08:52.925 --> 08:55.125
You can't say no
to an elf on Christmas Eve.

09:01.325 --> 09:04.165
Come on. There must be one in here.

09:06.565 --> 09:08.685
We decked out the tack room.
Can you tell?

09:11.565 --> 09:12.605
Zoe?

09:12.845 --> 09:14.005
What are you looking for?

09:14.205 --> 09:16.485
- A horse.
- I don't think one would fit in there.

09:17.485 --> 09:18.805
It's for my grandpa.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.885
I broke his decoration.

09:20.965 --> 09:23.925
You know, he's been a little down
since Wilma left, but…

09:24.885 --> 09:25.965
this is different.

09:27.085 --> 09:28.805
I feel like he's almost
trying to hide something.

09:28.885 --> 09:30.125
More mince pies maybe?

09:30.565 --> 09:31.965
Look, you can glue it.

09:32.045 --> 09:34.165
Well, I already tried that,
but it won't hold.

09:34.685 --> 09:35.925
Becky, look.

09:37.925 --> 09:38.965
No way.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.325
What is it? What am I missing?

09:40.405 --> 09:42.485
Okay, so this was made on the island.

09:42.725 --> 09:45.285
By a famous toy maker that used to
give them to the kids on Christmas Eve.

09:45.365 --> 09:46.845
It's a proper island legend.

09:46.925 --> 09:49.485
- He was so kind.
- He's a real jolly gent.

09:50.125 --> 09:52.085
- What happened to him?
- No one knows.

09:52.165 --> 09:55.525
- I heard he lives out in the woods.
- Yeah, but he has to keep a low profile

09:55.605 --> 09:57.445
because he is basically O.S.

09:57.525 --> 09:58.605
O.S.?

10:02.005 --> 10:03.085
Original Santa.

10:04.765 --> 10:06.245
He marked his name on the chest. Look.

10:06.325 --> 10:09.125
That is basically
scientific proof right there.

10:11.645 --> 10:15.725
Well, we need to find this O.S.

10:15.805 --> 10:17.805
and get him to make
my grandpa another horse.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.405
- Who's with me?
- Me.

10:19.965 --> 10:21.085
Me.

10:30.365 --> 10:32.605
Gaby? Gaby.

10:33.605 --> 10:34.645
Gaby!

10:38.965 --> 10:40.365
Are you living here?

10:41.925 --> 10:43.245
Oh, that's a sleeping bag.

10:44.565 --> 10:46.405
Oh, you are aren't you?

10:47.005 --> 10:49.485
Whatever, it's not a big deal.
It's just…

10:50.285 --> 10:53.005
- Just till I get things sorted.
- What happened to Holloway?

10:53.085 --> 10:54.645
They kicked me out.

10:56.285 --> 10:58.925
But I would really appreciate it

10:59.005 --> 11:01.365
if you didn't say anything
about this to anyone.

11:02.205 --> 11:03.685
Your secret's safe with me.

11:05.285 --> 11:07.605
- Really?
- As long as you do exactly what I say.

11:17.765 --> 11:20.085
Are you sure this is a good idea?
The performance is at midday,

11:20.165 --> 11:22.405
- we haven't sorted the lighting out…
- Relax, Jade.

11:22.485 --> 11:24.725
Pony Squad-mas is a go.

11:25.925 --> 11:27.365
Pony Squad-mas?

11:27.805 --> 11:29.125
I knew you'd approve.

11:32.845 --> 11:35.805
Gaby! Could you please hurry up?

11:35.885 --> 11:38.165
I want Firefly's stable sparkling
before I leave.

11:41.725 --> 11:43.285
- On it.
- Good.

11:44.485 --> 11:46.765
Who turned Gaby into the helpful elf?

11:50.485 --> 11:51.485
Gaby!

11:52.325 --> 11:53.725
Hay, girl.

11:55.765 --> 11:57.285
Wanna go on a ride with us today?

11:58.725 --> 12:02.685
I can't… sorry.
Mia wants Firefly's stable mucked out.

12:04.005 --> 12:04.885
Wait, I'm sorry.

12:04.965 --> 12:08.165
For a moment I thought you said
Mia wants Firefly's stable mucked out.

12:10.325 --> 12:12.165
- What's going on?
- I'm just helping out.

12:12.245 --> 12:13.485
Yeah. I was born yesterday.

12:13.565 --> 12:16.365
Maybe I'd rather muck out a stable
than go on your lame ride.

12:17.925 --> 12:19.125
Okay, then.

12:38.365 --> 12:39.485
Is this it?

12:39.925 --> 12:41.405
Doesn't seem very jolly.

12:42.685 --> 12:44.805
Maybe it gets more jolly
the further in you go?

12:45.525 --> 12:46.765
It's kind of creepy.

12:47.525 --> 12:48.885
Original Santa's house!

12:51.925 --> 12:53.445
Well, this is the place.

13:09.085 --> 13:12.085
Oh my Bob.

13:15.005 --> 13:16.165
Guys, look!

13:16.645 --> 13:17.525
A sleigh!

13:18.125 --> 13:19.125
Santa!

13:19.965 --> 13:21.005
Becky!

13:26.445 --> 13:28.885
Okay. Here goes nothing.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.365
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

13:32.005 --> 13:33.445
This guy is a legend.

13:34.005 --> 13:35.765
He's the spirit of Christmas.

13:36.205 --> 13:38.405
I for one can't wait to see
his jolly face again.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.085
- He's not here.
- Guess we better go then!

13:50.165 --> 13:53.365
- Jade, we can't just give up.
- Guys, he's coming! Santa's coming!

14:00.965 --> 14:02.205
Santa!

14:02.485 --> 14:03.725
Owen, actually.

14:04.565 --> 14:05.645
Sure you are…

14:06.565 --> 14:07.565
"Owen."

14:08.125 --> 14:09.245
Are you carol singers?

14:10.285 --> 14:11.565
- No.
- We could sing.

14:11.645 --> 14:13.085
I hate carol singers.

14:13.165 --> 14:14.245
Or not.

14:14.325 --> 14:16.245
So? What do you want?

14:16.325 --> 14:20.685
I accidentally broke a decoration,
and I was hoping you could fix it.

14:31.445 --> 14:32.525
Where did you get this?

14:32.605 --> 14:34.365
It was my Grandpa's. Frank Steel?

14:34.445 --> 14:37.205
I think you made it for him
back in, like, 1500 or something.

14:37.285 --> 14:38.445
Get off my land.

14:39.885 --> 14:41.845
- Huh?
- Get away from here!

14:42.245 --> 14:44.285
Go on! Scram!

14:51.765 --> 14:54.605
If ever there was a time to find
your inner speed demon Bob, it's now!

15:00.645 --> 15:02.885
That man was definitely not Santa.

15:02.965 --> 15:06.405
It was like he had one look at
that Christmas decoration and went crazy.

15:10.245 --> 15:11.725
Owen…

15:11.805 --> 15:14.525
Come on, Zoe. Before he catches us
in his mean old sleigh.

15:15.725 --> 15:17.925
We should be getting
the Christmas show ready anyway.

15:29.045 --> 15:30.045
What is that?

15:30.525 --> 15:33.325
The invite said "black tie," Marcus.
It didn't say anything about a tux.

15:33.405 --> 15:36.925
Well Pin, "black tie" is just
a rich person's way of saying "suit up."

15:39.205 --> 15:40.565
Mia wouldn't mind
if I didn't have one, though.

15:41.445 --> 15:42.565
Have you met Mia?

15:43.245 --> 15:45.325
Trust me, you need a suit.

15:45.405 --> 15:46.885
- I haven't got a suit.
- I've got a suit.

15:47.005 --> 15:48.365
- Is it an elf suit?
- Yes.

15:48.445 --> 15:50.765
- I'll pass.
- Don't worry, I always carry a spare.

15:52.325 --> 15:54.045
- Lights have changed.
- Let's go, go, go.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.685
Ferry will be leaving soon.

15:56.365 --> 15:58.685
- Are you boys from the island?
- Ignore her.

15:59.805 --> 16:00.965
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:01.045 --> 16:03.125
I need to drop a turkey off
at my daughter's house,

16:03.205 --> 16:05.005
but my car is on the blink
and I really need…

16:05.085 --> 16:06.645
Sure. We can help.

16:06.725 --> 16:08.885
- Thank you.
- Pin, what are you doing?

16:08.965 --> 16:12.005
We're going the same way.
You can just put the turkey in the…

16:13.365 --> 16:14.365
Thanks.

16:15.805 --> 16:16.885
…back.

16:18.885 --> 16:20.165
It's looking at me funny.

16:20.365 --> 16:21.805
I think it likes you.

16:23.045 --> 16:24.045
Just drive.

16:34.045 --> 16:35.605
Oh, I know, I know.

16:35.685 --> 16:37.925
It's chaos,
but it's going to be perfect.

16:38.005 --> 16:39.645
This all looks very…

16:41.125 --> 16:42.045
expensive.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.045
Does it?

16:43.365 --> 16:44.845
Oh… good.

16:44.925 --> 16:47.845
It's like a smaller version of that gala
we went to last week, isn't it, darling?

16:49.045 --> 16:52.285
By the way,
your bruschettas are a touch overdone.

16:52.365 --> 16:54.325
You might want to have a word
with the chef.

16:54.725 --> 16:55.965
Thanks.

16:57.005 --> 16:59.405
I've always dreamed of being invited
to the Mistletoe Ball

16:59.485 --> 17:00.685
and now here I am…

17:01.245 --> 17:03.605
basically guest of honor.

17:05.045 --> 17:08.325
- It's like a fairy tale come true.
- And I'm your handsome prince.

17:08.405 --> 17:09.244
Aww.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.244
You okay?

17:27.165 --> 17:28.204
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

17:28.605 --> 17:32.845
It's just that your dad's girlfriend
is really young, and a bit mean, and…

17:36.525 --> 17:39.885
He is going to be so impressed
when he sees this all come together.

17:40.205 --> 17:42.125
Especially with the singer you booked.

17:42.205 --> 17:43.365
Do you really think so?

17:44.525 --> 17:46.405
Yeah. I do.

17:50.525 --> 17:52.805
It's nice doing things
for other people, isn't it?

17:53.845 --> 17:55.085
Makes you feel good.

17:55.165 --> 17:56.445
What's your point?

17:56.805 --> 17:59.085
I think we should invite Gaby to the ball.

18:00.565 --> 18:01.405
Oh!

18:03.365 --> 18:04.685
Very funny, Susie.

18:06.445 --> 18:08.525
Oh, I told you, mistletoe to the right!

18:14.365 --> 18:16.005
Come on, we've got work to do.

18:24.285 --> 18:25.525
How are you getting on?

18:26.485 --> 18:28.445
I can't go any faster,
if that's what you mean.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.245
No, I'm not here because of Mia.

18:31.565 --> 18:33.285
So you wanna dig too?

18:35.085 --> 18:36.845
Why don't you ever stand up to her?

18:36.925 --> 18:38.485
- I do.
- No.

18:38.565 --> 18:40.445
You always let her win in the end.

18:40.845 --> 18:42.325
- No, I don't.
- You're the same with Callum.

18:42.885 --> 18:44.325
I broke up with him.

18:45.605 --> 18:48.485
Well, at least his new girlfriend looks
like she can stand up for herself.

18:49.685 --> 18:51.485
Oh, you didn't know?

18:53.285 --> 18:54.445
Yes, he's moved on.

18:55.485 --> 18:56.325
Ouch.

19:03.325 --> 19:07.285
You know, we're all trying to like you.

19:09.605 --> 19:11.165
But you don't make it easy.

19:13.885 --> 19:14.765
Well…

19:15.365 --> 19:17.085
why don't you save yourself the bother

19:17.925 --> 19:19.085
and leave me alone?

19:27.245 --> 19:30.845
- So, what do you think?
- Becky's going to flip out.

19:31.645 --> 19:33.565
- In a good way?
- In the best way!

19:33.645 --> 19:35.165
- Wanna see 'em?
- Yeah.

19:36.445 --> 19:38.245
I put them on the roof, too.

19:47.845 --> 19:49.005
Too much?

19:49.565 --> 19:51.565
Nuh-uh. They're epic.

20:01.125 --> 20:02.485
I'm sure it'll be fine.

20:12.885 --> 20:14.885
"Dear Owen, I know you won't read this,

20:14.965 --> 20:17.325
but I wish you all the joy there is
this Christmas."

20:18.445 --> 20:19.645
O.S.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.125
Owen Steel?

20:24.365 --> 20:26.845
Grandpa, do you have a brother?

20:26.925 --> 20:30.805
- I did. Well, I do, but…
- And he made this?

20:30.885 --> 20:32.045
Yes, he did.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.925
Well, I met him today.

20:34.285 --> 20:35.765
You went out to the cottage?

20:35.845 --> 20:38.005
Yeah, I wanted to get you
a new decoration, but…

20:38.525 --> 20:40.965
- he's kind of mean.
- Yes, I'm afraid that's Owen.

20:41.525 --> 20:44.725
We used to be close,
but we had a bit of a falling-out.

20:45.685 --> 20:47.725
I still send him a card every year,
but well,

20:47.805 --> 20:49.685
it's been 30 years of silence.

20:49.925 --> 20:51.485
Maybe it's time to give up.

20:54.525 --> 20:57.605
Now we can get on
with this perfect Christmas of yours.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.165
Oh my Bob, oh my Bob.

21:23.245 --> 21:25.245
There's so many people here.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.365
I invited all of the yard
and their parents,

21:27.445 --> 21:30.325
and their parents' parents,
and now I'm seriously regretting that.

21:30.685 --> 21:33.445
We will be fine.
It's a simple little show…

21:40.125 --> 21:41.285
Okay, I know that look.

21:43.245 --> 21:45.645
I invented that look. What have you done?

21:47.765 --> 21:49.685
You're going to be blown away.

21:51.045 --> 21:52.045
Gaby…

21:53.245 --> 21:55.205
I wanted to talk to you about my Ball.

21:55.285 --> 21:56.805
Do you have plans tonight?

21:57.245 --> 21:59.085
We were wondering if…

21:59.405 --> 22:00.325
Yeah?

22:01.125 --> 22:03.125
If you could pick up some shovels.

22:05.805 --> 22:07.685
- What?
- We're expecting heavy snow tonight,

22:07.765 --> 22:10.365
and I need you to keep
the drive clear for my guests.

22:17.325 --> 22:18.405
Go, Becky!

22:20.765 --> 22:23.125
That's Alex. I kissed him once.

22:23.245 --> 22:25.005
I know. I read your blog.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.525
- I signed up for the alerts.
- That was you?

22:28.125 --> 22:30.205
Everyone's here. It's time.

23:27.925 --> 23:29.245
I'll put him in his stable!

23:34.205 --> 23:36.005
Is that part of the show?

23:37.645 --> 23:38.885
That went well.

23:38.965 --> 23:40.845
I told you to take it easy on the lights.

23:40.925 --> 23:43.565
- You've blown the generator.
- Well, you know what they say.

23:43.645 --> 23:45.645
You should always leave
your audience wanting more.

23:46.405 --> 23:47.565
It was a disaster.

23:47.845 --> 23:50.365
- No, it was dramatic.
- There's always next year.

23:50.445 --> 23:51.965
All I wanted was to make people happy.

24:08.485 --> 24:11.525
I know it's cold outside,
but we won't be gone for long.

24:15.485 --> 24:17.485
- You going somewhere?
- Yeah, just…

24:18.045 --> 24:19.365
to make a delivery.

24:19.445 --> 24:21.605
- But I'll be back before lockup.
- Okay.

24:22.925 --> 24:23.925
Um, Gaby?

24:26.205 --> 24:28.845
Whatever Mia has on you,
you can't let her push you around.

24:31.085 --> 24:32.485
I can help… maybe.

24:37.325 --> 24:39.365
I can handle Mia. Thank you.

24:41.205 --> 24:42.965
But you should get going.

24:43.045 --> 24:44.125
It'll be dark soon.

25:28.365 --> 25:29.445
Come on, boy.

25:29.885 --> 25:31.885
It's only snow,
but we should get going.

25:34.205 --> 25:37.445
Hi, Gaby.
I need you at my house with the shovels.

25:37.525 --> 25:39.525
This snow storm is coming in
quicker than expected.

25:39.605 --> 25:40.645
Snow storm?

25:40.725 --> 25:43.685
Daddy says the northern part of the island
is about to get battered by it.

25:43.765 --> 25:48.165
We need to prepare. Just get here… now.

26:02.405 --> 26:04.965
Did we really have to pick up
the massive pointy star?

26:05.045 --> 26:06.605
Come on, Scrooge.
Where's your Christmas spirit?

26:06.685 --> 26:07.605
On the island!

26:07.685 --> 26:10.205
And if we don't make it,
I may never get it back.

26:11.605 --> 26:12.565
Here it is.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.405
We made it!

26:20.445 --> 26:21.325
No way.

26:29.445 --> 26:32.085
- Mia, this is incredible.
- Do you really think so?

26:32.925 --> 26:36.085
- I want a photo of us. Gigi?
- I'd love to.

26:36.765 --> 26:38.285
Sorry, I meant could you take it?

26:40.565 --> 26:41.765
Absolutely.

26:44.005 --> 26:45.725
You do like her, don't you?

26:48.565 --> 26:51.325
Yeah, of course.
I just want you to be happy.

26:53.965 --> 26:55.605
Perfect family photo.

26:56.925 --> 26:58.405
I'll get us a drink.

27:02.045 --> 27:05.285
Gigi, you've got your finger
over every single one of them.

27:05.365 --> 27:06.445
Oh gosh, have I?

27:06.805 --> 27:09.285
That's the trouble
with these diamond manicures.

27:09.765 --> 27:12.125
By the way,
the path outside is like an ice rink.

27:12.205 --> 27:14.445
You really ought to get that sorted.

27:14.765 --> 27:17.685
Ooh, cocktails. How quaint.

27:21.605 --> 27:24.445
Look. I think Gigi ruined
every single photo on purpose.

27:25.085 --> 27:26.245
And where is Gaby?

27:26.325 --> 27:28.645
She's supposed to be sweeping the path.

27:31.565 --> 27:34.965
Hello? Mia's phone,
Susie speaking. How can I…

27:36.005 --> 27:36.965
Oh, no.

27:37.965 --> 27:39.325
That's not good news.

27:42.125 --> 27:45.125
Yeah, I'll be sure to let her know.

27:54.685 --> 27:57.005
Come on boy, just a little further.

28:15.405 --> 28:17.405
Owen… are you in here?

28:20.245 --> 28:21.285
Uncle Owen?

28:23.765 --> 28:25.085
Uncle Owen?

28:26.165 --> 28:27.165
Hello?

28:38.445 --> 28:41.205
"Dearest Owen, happy Christmas my brother.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.085
I hope to see you soon."

28:44.085 --> 28:45.885
I mean, he opened them.

28:46.605 --> 28:48.125
So then he must care.

28:55.325 --> 28:56.405
Where are you?

29:04.485 --> 29:05.605
What is it, boy?

29:06.245 --> 29:07.725
Help!

29:10.005 --> 29:12.085
Help!

29:12.645 --> 29:18.485
- Okay. It's okay. Can you walk?
- Does it look as though I can walk?

29:18.565 --> 29:21.285
- How long have you been out here?
- Only about an hour.

29:22.045 --> 29:23.645
We have to keep you warm.

29:23.725 --> 29:26.205
No, I think I'll stay here
and rest a while.

29:26.285 --> 29:28.165
No. Owen, listen to me.

29:28.245 --> 29:30.245
Owen, wake up! Owen!

29:31.325 --> 29:33.125
Help! Help!

29:35.365 --> 29:36.365
Help!

29:44.365 --> 29:46.885
- Is he okay?
- No. He's frozen to the core.

29:46.965 --> 29:48.765
Let me help you get him back to the house.

29:48.845 --> 29:52.405
No, there's no central heating, no logs.
We can't stay here.

29:53.205 --> 29:55.805
- Can Raven carry him?
- No. He's dead weight.

29:55.885 --> 29:58.285
Well, then, we're gonna need
a Christmas miracle.

30:02.765 --> 30:04.005
Okay, I have an idea.

30:28.645 --> 30:29.765
Come on!

30:30.605 --> 30:32.045
Come on, Raven. You got this!

30:33.485 --> 30:35.605
That's it, Firefly! Keep going!

30:36.085 --> 30:37.685
You're loving this, aren't you?

30:37.765 --> 30:39.965
They say you should
try something new every day.

30:43.165 --> 30:44.565
Come on, Raven!

30:46.725 --> 30:48.085
The snow is getting pretty bad.

30:51.245 --> 30:53.245
I know, I know, I know.

30:56.005 --> 30:57.805
This old guy really isn't doing so well.

30:57.885 --> 30:59.685
Less of the old.

30:59.765 --> 31:01.645
Hang in there. We're almost there.

31:02.765 --> 31:04.245
Maybe we should turn around.

31:04.325 --> 31:05.645
Gaby, this is the only way.

31:07.245 --> 31:09.525
- Come on.
- Zoe?

31:10.365 --> 31:12.645
- Zoe!
- She should be back by now.

31:12.965 --> 31:14.325
Raven's not in his stable.

31:16.245 --> 31:17.365
She's still out there.

31:17.445 --> 31:19.925
What if she's lost?
We have to do something.

31:25.245 --> 31:27.565
Becky, how hard can you pedal?

31:35.845 --> 31:37.205
Why have we stopped?

31:38.805 --> 31:40.925
We're lost, aren't we. Zoe?

31:41.005 --> 31:43.325
I can't see anything.
The snow's too thick.

31:43.405 --> 31:45.525
This is serious. He's really bad.

31:45.605 --> 31:47.645
No, look!

31:47.725 --> 31:48.645
What is that?

31:52.445 --> 31:53.645
Bright Fields.

32:04.125 --> 32:06.085
- Can you see her?
- Keep going!

32:06.165 --> 32:08.325
Keep going. Got it.

32:13.205 --> 32:15.045
Come on, boys. Follow the lights!

32:25.245 --> 32:27.045
You're not going to believe this!

32:30.805 --> 32:31.765
Santa!

32:31.845 --> 32:34.205
- Zoe!
- Even better!

32:46.285 --> 32:48.205
It says there's another midnight crossing.

32:48.285 --> 32:51.325
Christmas Eve timetable.
I don't make the rules.

32:54.325 --> 32:56.205
And there's nothing that you can do?

33:00.525 --> 33:01.525
Sorry, guys.

33:02.245 --> 33:06.005
We'd have made it if you hadn't kept
picking up random weirdos. No offense.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.445
- None taken.
- Don't mention it.

33:07.525 --> 33:10.125
It's Christmas, Marcus.
Was I supposed to just leave them?

33:10.205 --> 33:12.645
Well, now we're not gonna make it
to the party, Pin.

33:13.845 --> 33:15.725
That's exactly what you wanted.

33:16.445 --> 33:18.125
- Isn't it?
- What?

33:18.205 --> 33:19.645
You know what I mean.

33:30.845 --> 33:32.565
Where's Becky?
She said she'd meet me here,

33:32.645 --> 33:35.125
but when I called her,
she sounded weirdly out of breath.

33:36.725 --> 33:38.405
Susie? You okay?

33:38.965 --> 33:41.965
It's a disaster, Alex. Mia booked a singer

33:42.045 --> 33:43.965
as a surprise for her dad,
but they're stuck on the mainland.

33:44.325 --> 33:47.565
- Okay. What's your plan?
- Leave the country and never return?

33:49.725 --> 33:52.205
Okay. Before you do that…

33:53.245 --> 33:54.565
I might have a better idea.

34:01.965 --> 34:03.085
Grandpa!

34:04.045 --> 34:05.325
Now, what's going on?

34:05.405 --> 34:06.965
I was about to turn in.

34:09.525 --> 34:10.565
Owen.

34:16.005 --> 34:17.324
This way.

34:22.764 --> 34:23.844
There you go.

34:26.405 --> 34:28.685
I'll just get warm
and then I'll be on my way.

34:28.764 --> 34:29.844
Don't be daft.

34:30.045 --> 34:32.804
You're welcome here.
You always have been.

34:32.885 --> 34:35.764
Spare me the dreaded Christmas spirit.

34:38.045 --> 34:40.245
I'd have thought
you would have thrown that out years ago.

34:40.324 --> 34:41.525
I treasure it.

34:43.005 --> 34:43.925
Clearly.

34:44.925 --> 34:46.364
Snapped in two.

34:47.804 --> 34:49.645
Well, I mean, that was me.

34:55.125 --> 34:57.845
We used to give these out
to the kids on the pier, remember?

34:58.405 --> 35:00.485
- From the sleigh.
- Free to a good home.

35:00.805 --> 35:04.325
- Then a penny. Then a pound.
- I did well for myself. Is that a crime?

35:04.405 --> 35:07.005
- You forgot where you came from.
- I certainly didn't.

35:07.525 --> 35:12.005
I made sure every day of my life
that I wasn't going to end up…

35:12.805 --> 35:14.925
broke and hopeless like Dad.

35:18.405 --> 35:20.805
I'm not going to apologize for my success.

35:22.325 --> 35:23.285
I had a talent.

35:23.845 --> 35:25.285
- Made me rich.
- Yes,

35:26.045 --> 35:28.005
but it also made you cold.

35:28.405 --> 35:31.165
And that's why Beth chose me.

35:35.725 --> 35:36.605
Wait a minute.

35:37.165 --> 35:39.445
Grandpa, did you steal
Uncle Owen's girlfriend?

35:39.525 --> 35:41.165
He didn't have time for her.

35:41.285 --> 35:43.285
He broke your grandma's heart.

35:46.725 --> 35:47.645
That's true.

35:48.845 --> 35:49.765
I did.

35:54.965 --> 35:58.125
- Well, can we fix this?
- It's too late.

35:58.205 --> 36:00.325
- He's too stubborn.
- He never sees my point of view.

36:00.405 --> 36:02.525
No, I'm talking about this.

36:04.045 --> 36:05.965
There's some things that you can't fix

36:06.045 --> 36:07.725
and some things you can.

36:16.325 --> 36:17.405
Yeah.

36:23.205 --> 36:24.605
I haven't got my tools.

36:32.645 --> 36:33.685
You kept them?

36:34.165 --> 36:35.085
Just in case.

36:41.045 --> 36:43.285
Come on, for old time's sake.

36:56.445 --> 36:58.405
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

36:58.725 --> 37:00.565
He's got a mug of Grandpa's hot chocolate

37:00.645 --> 37:03.045
and three decades of sibling issues
to catch up on.

37:03.125 --> 37:04.205
He'll be fine.

37:05.565 --> 37:07.125
Okay, well…

37:07.205 --> 37:09.325
I better get back to Holloway.

37:10.445 --> 37:11.565
Gaby, wait.

37:12.445 --> 37:14.205
Can you please tell me what's wrong?

37:16.445 --> 37:19.365
And don't shut yourself off
from all of us. Be less Owen.

37:19.445 --> 37:22.925
He pushed people away
and ended up on his own.

37:23.765 --> 37:25.045
Then at least come to the Ball.

37:26.525 --> 37:28.605
I mean, Mia would actually go mad.

37:29.005 --> 37:31.405
Seriously? Another good reason to go.

37:32.045 --> 37:33.605
I don't have anything to wear.

37:35.325 --> 37:38.565
So this is where
my fifth grade performance

37:38.645 --> 37:40.605
of being the Fairy Godmother
comes in handy.

37:41.205 --> 37:44.605

What do you think?

38:28.525 --> 38:29.845
You look great.

38:29.925 --> 38:32.005
I mean, it's definitely you.

38:34.005 --> 38:35.525
Zoe, you look amazing.

38:36.645 --> 38:38.285
I wish Pin could see you.

38:39.365 --> 38:41.405
Have you heard from him?

38:42.885 --> 38:44.885
Not for a while, but…

38:46.645 --> 38:48.325
I know he'll come back to me.

38:52.045 --> 38:53.125
When he's ready.

39:01.965 --> 39:04.485
I think it's hot chocolate,
but it could be mushroom soup.

39:08.645 --> 39:11.565
I'm sorry that I snapped earlier.

39:12.445 --> 39:16.525
Mia's going through a really hard time
and I promised I'd look after her.

39:18.725 --> 39:20.325
- It's chocolate.
- Phew.

39:27.645 --> 39:28.725
You were right.

39:31.045 --> 39:32.685
I am scared about going home.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.805
What if she's changed her mind, Marcus?

39:36.325 --> 39:39.045
This whole duke thing is so weird
and unexpected.

39:40.125 --> 39:41.525
What if it changes things?

39:41.765 --> 39:44.165
What exactly do you think
she's gonna have a problem with?

39:44.245 --> 39:46.805
A fancy title? The massive castle?

39:46.885 --> 39:48.725
Zoe's got her own stuff going on.

39:50.605 --> 39:53.565
I just don't want this to get in the way.

39:53.845 --> 39:56.765
Mate… she chose you.

39:57.805 --> 40:01.325
The only thing between you and her
right now is that ocean

40:01.725 --> 40:04.605
and that very helpful
ferry attendant over there.

40:10.925 --> 40:11.965
Yeah.

40:12.885 --> 40:13.845
You're right.

40:23.005 --> 40:24.325
- Open the gates.
- I can't.

40:24.405 --> 40:27.165
You can… and you will.

40:28.525 --> 40:29.965
By order of the Duke.

40:38.045 --> 40:39.965
Yes, Pin! I mean, Your Honor.

40:40.765 --> 40:43.525
- Who is that guy?
- Wait for us!

41:03.925 --> 41:04.805
Shall we?

41:06.525 --> 41:07.405
Let's.

41:08.325 --> 41:11.485
Welcome to the Mistletoe Ball.

41:48.245 --> 41:51.285
Whoa. Who is that with Zoe?

41:51.805 --> 41:53.485
She's beautiful.

41:53.885 --> 41:54.885
Is that…

41:55.485 --> 41:56.645
It can't be.

41:58.605 --> 41:59.485
Gaby?

41:59.565 --> 42:04.605
Jade, Becky,
introducing Miss Gaby Grant of Holloway.

42:04.885 --> 42:07.765
You look like a total Hollo-babe.

42:08.045 --> 42:08.885
Stop it.

42:09.245 --> 42:12.085
I guess Pony Squad scrubs up well.

42:13.485 --> 42:14.645
Does Mia know you're here?

42:17.005 --> 42:20.285
Will someone please go and check that
Gaby's clearing the snow for my guests?

42:20.365 --> 42:21.685
Thank you.

42:26.045 --> 42:28.405
- Who is that?
- Someone who didn't read their invite.

42:28.485 --> 42:30.845
I was very clear. White for ladies.

42:31.405 --> 42:34.165
Photographer's taking lots of pictures
of Daddy as soon as the singer starts,

42:34.245 --> 42:36.645
and well, we can't have her ruining
all of them.

42:36.725 --> 42:38.765
Mia, wait. There's…

42:38.845 --> 42:41.925
There's something you should know
about the singer.

42:42.365 --> 42:45.045
Yes. Elliott's so excited about that.

42:46.005 --> 42:48.285
- You told him?
- He hates surprises.

42:48.365 --> 42:49.525
You know that.

42:50.885 --> 42:52.285
Well, anyway…

42:53.045 --> 42:54.285
the singer cancelled.

42:56.245 --> 42:58.245
- What?
- Surprise.

43:04.525 --> 43:05.965
Such a shame.

43:25.245 --> 43:26.725
Ladies and gentlemen.

43:27.365 --> 43:32.165
I just wanted to thank you all
for coming to our famous Mistletoe Ball.

43:37.285 --> 43:38.965
I know you're all very excited

43:39.045 --> 43:42.125
to find out who the entertainment
is going to be this year,

43:42.405 --> 43:46.325
but unfortunately…

43:46.685 --> 43:47.845
they've had to cancel.

43:48.245 --> 43:50.005
What a terrible shame.

43:50.085 --> 43:51.125
Sorry, Daddy.

43:53.085 --> 43:56.725
But luckily for you all, we found
an excellent replacement at short notice.

43:57.205 --> 43:59.885
- Don't worry, we got this.
- Becky, what's going on?

44:00.565 --> 44:02.845
Wow, you all look amazing.

44:03.725 --> 44:06.205
Susie, I love your hair.
Zoe, that wrap is gorgeous.

44:06.285 --> 44:08.125
Becky! Focus.

44:08.725 --> 44:09.845
Right.

44:09.925 --> 44:12.445
The singer cancelled,
but the show will go on.

44:13.205 --> 44:15.605
If you'd all just like to make your way
to the front of the house.

44:15.965 --> 44:17.685
What on Earth is going on?

44:20.445 --> 44:21.365
No.

44:25.765 --> 44:29.525

44:52.885 --> 44:54.725
What a strange display.

44:55.525 --> 44:56.725
At least it was cheap.

44:57.965 --> 45:00.045
I know you're disappointed, but…

45:00.125 --> 45:02.325
Just try to enjoy the rest of the night.

45:08.205 --> 45:09.485
Did you hear that?

45:09.565 --> 45:11.685
Your precious daddy
thought your show was cheap.

45:12.085 --> 45:13.805
Just like everyone else here.

45:13.885 --> 45:16.645
- You can't talk to me like that.
- Actually, I can.

45:16.725 --> 45:18.045
You better get used to it.

45:20.325 --> 45:22.645
What's that supposed to mean?

45:22.725 --> 45:26.005
Didn't Elliott tell you?
We were ring shopping earlier.

45:27.165 --> 45:28.885
And when I move in,

45:28.965 --> 45:31.205
things will be very different around here.

45:31.285 --> 45:34.605
There will be no snow
on the paths, for starters.

45:39.725 --> 45:41.325
Why hasn't Gaby cleared the snow?

45:41.845 --> 45:44.645

45:52.925 --> 45:54.605

Gaby! You think you're so clever.
Don't you?

47:03.805 --> 47:05.285
Sneaking in here…

47:05.365 --> 47:07.085
humiliating me in front of everyone.

47:07.685 --> 47:10.165
I'm sorry.
If I offend you that much, I will just go.

47:10.245 --> 47:12.245
Well, you have no right to be here.

47:13.725 --> 47:14.965
You don't deserve it.

47:16.245 --> 47:17.165
Any of it.

47:19.045 --> 47:21.285
All you've ever done is cause trouble.

47:23.765 --> 47:25.485
- Take that back, Mia.
- Honestly…

47:26.045 --> 47:27.245
I'll just go.

47:28.645 --> 47:30.365
Where? Back to the stables?

47:34.085 --> 47:36.485
Oh. Didn't you all know?

47:37.125 --> 47:40.325
Gaby's been sleeping rough
at Bright Fields.

47:45.605 --> 47:48.045
Yeah, Holloway finally saw sense, and…

47:48.485 --> 47:49.405
kicked her out.

47:50.645 --> 47:51.565
Gaby?

47:52.605 --> 47:53.605
Is that true?

47:55.845 --> 47:57.005
Yeah, it's true.

47:57.765 --> 47:59.325
I had no idea.

48:00.485 --> 48:03.205
This has been a blast, thank you,
ladies and gents. I'm gonna go.

48:06.925 --> 48:10.245
- Nice Christmas spirit, Mia.
- You're a fine one to talk.

48:10.645 --> 48:12.325
Been so wrapped up
in your own merry Christmas

48:12.405 --> 48:15.725
you didn't even realize
that your new best friend is homeless.

48:22.045 --> 48:23.045
Zoe?

48:23.845 --> 48:25.005
- Pin!
- Pin's back!

48:27.205 --> 48:29.165
You're here. You're really here!

48:29.245 --> 48:31.605
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I missed the whole party.

48:31.885 --> 48:35.045
Wait right here.
There's something I need to do.

48:40.005 --> 48:41.085
I'll be back.

Gaby…

50:32.605 --> 50:35.845

50:35.925 --> 50:37.045
That's the deal.

50:39.685 --> 50:41.605
And all I'm asking now is,

50:42.405 --> 50:43.605
where are you going?

50:48.405 --> 50:49.845
I have no idea.

50:51.405 --> 50:53.285
Well, I do.

50:54.885 --> 50:56.845

<i>♪ Is there pity for the plain girl? ♪</i>

51:10.845 --> 51:12.725
- Thank you for having us.
- Thank you for coming.

51:12.805 --> 51:15.085
- I'm sorry about the entertainment.
- Yes. Goodbye!

51:15.405 --> 51:17.285
What a disaster.

51:17.365 --> 51:19.365
Hey, people had a good time.

51:19.445 --> 51:22.925
The chairman of the governors
almost broke an ankle on that icy drive.

51:24.085 --> 51:26.525
She was livid.

51:28.805 --> 51:31.205
Oh, don't worry, darling. I stepped in.

51:31.285 --> 51:33.925
Told her that's what happens
when you let a child plan a party.

51:34.005 --> 51:37.365
- Mia did a great job.
- Of ruining Elliott's good name.

51:37.925 --> 51:40.845
Marcus… Gigi's right.

51:40.925 --> 51:42.165
It was a disaster.

51:42.685 --> 51:44.325
I don't know what I was thinking.

51:44.405 --> 51:47.325
- Your party was perfect.
- Perfectly dreadful.

51:47.725 --> 51:51.205
I'm sorry our little party didn't live up
to your expectations.

51:51.285 --> 51:52.165
Elliott…

51:53.245 --> 51:55.005
I didn't mean…

51:55.085 --> 51:58.125
- I think it's time to leave.
- Good idea. I'll get our coats.

51:58.205 --> 51:59.845
No. Just you.

52:02.365 --> 52:04.885
- What?
- No one talks to my daughter like that.

52:15.245 --> 52:16.325
I'm sorry, Daddy.

52:17.405 --> 52:20.405
The party was supposed to show everyone
that we're still important,

52:20.485 --> 52:23.205
- even after losing the stables.
- And it worked.

52:23.285 --> 52:26.565
I made some deals tonight
that could be very interesting.

52:28.325 --> 52:30.645
Well that's great, Daddy.

52:31.245 --> 52:33.085
We're on the up, Mia. Thanks to you.

52:33.925 --> 52:36.485
And we're together at Christmas.
That's the main thing.

52:46.845 --> 52:50.245
It's Christmas!

52:58.285 --> 53:01.285
I thought Christmas had to be
a certain way to be perfect.

53:01.365 --> 53:04.325
The perfect decorations,
the perfect playlist,

53:04.405 --> 53:05.645
the perfect eggnog.

53:06.965 --> 53:08.725
Eggnog is officially gross!

53:09.285 --> 53:11.045
But it turns out,

53:11.125 --> 53:13.045
none of that really matters.

53:13.125 --> 53:14.645
Christmas is more than that.

53:21.285 --> 53:23.085
Mr. Gobbles, come back!

53:27.765 --> 53:29.565
- Merry Christmas, Mia.
- Thank you.

53:31.165 --> 53:32.685
I just wanted to say…

53:33.245 --> 53:35.605
I'm sorry to all of you,
but especially you, Gaby.

53:37.205 --> 53:39.485
I got carried away
trying to impress my dad.

53:40.365 --> 53:41.285
Well…

53:42.805 --> 53:44.725
an apology is not enough.

53:45.125 --> 53:45.965
Oh.

53:48.565 --> 53:49.965
I will require…

53:51.205 --> 53:54.925

- Where's Owen?
- Home, said he was tired.

55:34.885 --> 55:36.045
Well, obviously.

55:36.125 --> 55:38.765
- He was up all night delivering presents.
- Presents?

55:38.845 --> 55:41.525
Come on, Frank.
You must have worked out who he is by now.

55:41.845 --> 55:43.285
No. Who is he?

55:43.365 --> 55:44.605
