15:55.372 --> 15:58.990
An early volunteer.
He called himself Marshall.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.661
Volunteer?

16:00.794 --> 16:04.787
A scavenger we put
in the machine.
A test subject before you.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.839
That was five years ago.

16:08.969 --> 16:09.958
The machine did that to him?

16:11.221 --> 16:14.008
Before we perfected
our tether.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.347
He was lost in
the time-stream.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.012
How is he here?

16:19.229 --> 16:21.015
This explosion
of temporal energy
from the machine

16:21.148 --> 16:22.137
must have splintered him here.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.978
Well, if that's the case,

16:26.069 --> 16:28.731

might be in here with us?

17:00.937 --> 17:02.848
It was sabotage.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.646
Someone with intimate
knowledge of
how our machine works

17:05.734 --> 17:07.395
is trying to create
a temporal meltdown.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.318
JAMES: Meltdown? Why?

17:10.405 --> 17:11.690
It would destroy the facility

17:11.781 --> 17:14.693
and create a chain reaction
which would be catastrophic

17:14.784 --> 17:16.490
to the time-stream.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.409
The Witness.

17:18.955 --> 17:22.743
That's what he told me
he wanted to do.
To destroy time itself.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.116
This is his counterstrike.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.122
The Witness is here.

17:29.758 --> 17:32.625
I thought it was in my head,
but it...

17:32.761 --> 17:34.297
What did you see?

17:35.597 --> 17:41.433
In the corridor,
I saw a man in a kind of
plague doctor mask.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.426
Itwas him. I know it.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.555
That could explain
the phantom tether
that Dr. Adler discovered.

17:46.650 --> 17:47.890
All right.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.361
First things first,
we need to stop the meltdown.

17:50.445 --> 17:52.481

It's safer.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.737
I'll be fine.

18:00.664 --> 18:04.282
We can replace the lens array.
Our old one is in
the east warehouse.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.624
The one that burned out
our first Core?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.540
But that's all
we've got right now.
I'll go with Mr. Deacon.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.462
That's not happening. I'll go.

we're all screwed.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.933
How do you know
it was the Witness?

18:32.028 --> 18:33.359
Because I've seen him before.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.229
After the Night Room,

18:36.324 --> 18:39.316
when they were holding me
captive, they had me
drink that red tea,

18:39.452 --> 18:41.192
and he was there.

18:41.329 --> 18:45.493
Cass, that stuff's dangerous.
What else haven't you told me?

18:47.669 --> 18:49.330
When I saw the Witness
in the hotel room...

18:49.462 --> 18:51.544
Yeah, when he looked
like Aaron.

18:52.382 --> 18:55.545
And then he changed
his appearance to you.

18:57.345 --> 18:58.334
To me, why?

18:58.847 --> 19:00.383
He was trying to get
through to me.

19:01.558 --> 19:06.052
Talking about how
they could stop death
if they destroyed time.

19:07.522 --> 19:11.231
And he thought your face
would have more
of an impact on me.
