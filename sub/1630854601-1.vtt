00:04.170 --> 00:05.463
St. Lucia is the most beautiful
island in the Caribbean.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.635
It's green from the beach...

00:12.429 --> 00:14.097
all the way up to the top.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.474
And it's lush.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.727
It's straight out of a postcard.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.854
Absolutely beautiful.

00:20.895 --> 00:24.482
And it's just, like, wow.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.901
Oh, this is a sh-- sandwich.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.696
I have been a captain 37 years.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.657
Everybody wants to be
a captain

00:32.699 --> 00:34.200
till it's time to do
captain sh--.

00:34.242 --> 00:37.245
Why are we losing the bow again?

00:37.287 --> 00:38.455
Pull, pull, pull.

00:38.496 --> 00:39.539
Son of a--

00:39.581 --> 00:41.875
I've set my expectations
for this season

00:41.916 --> 00:44.002
so far out of the ----ing park.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.253
We have an issue, sir.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.173
Look at me.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.301
Shrunk?

00:51.343 --> 00:53.470
* You in the presence of
an OG *

00:53.511 --> 00:58.099
After all these years, I've kind
of become the mercenary chef.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.893
I'm so over it.

00:59.934 --> 01:02.812
It's gonna haunt me for
the rest of my ----ing life.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.856
I'm just coming in to
murder some sh--

01:04.898 --> 01:06.816
and be that bitch
that makes you tips.

01:06.858 --> 01:09.569
* Go, Rachel, it's your
birthday, it's your birthday *

01:11.279 --> 01:14.616
I am back, and I've
been crowned king.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.159
Well, chief stew.

01:16.201 --> 01:19.287
It's not about how well you do,
unless you do really badly.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.581
Wait, it's a quite
confusing too, actually.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.083
Just one sec and
you can talk later,

01:23.124 --> 01:25.502
to yourself,
when I'm not around.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.587
It's so good to be in charge.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.005
No!

01:29.047 --> 01:30.590
Hm.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.676
I come from the
old school of yachting.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.094
Nice throw!

01:34.135 --> 01:35.804
When you work hard,
you work hard.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.180
This is why I did my stretches.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.431
Ah!

01:38.473 --> 01:40.308
But you should be able
to play hard.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.313
I have definitely
overstepped that line,

01:45.355 --> 01:47.857
but we try our best
to be professional.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.776
Who's been a good Ross?

01:52.153 --> 01:53.905
I love this attention.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.156
* I wanna be *

01:55.198 --> 01:56.408
I'm definitely a flirty person.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.784
* More than just a friend *

01:57.826 --> 01:59.119
Small-talk me.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.371
Well, we just have been
small-talking.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.123
I think we've
been medium-talking.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.541
Okay.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.334
Hooking up in yachting,
you're on these boats,

02:06.376 --> 02:07.836
pent-up stress.

02:09.504 --> 02:12.966
The attention is ----ing
like a dream on a yacht.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.801
-Yeah, could I?
-Rude.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.263
I am a small-town
Mississippi gal.

02:20.724 --> 02:21.933
Is she my boss?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.309
I'm a really big personality.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.728
I love to twerk.

02:24.769 --> 02:28.648
Spitting everywhere, too,
but I do love to twerk.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.900
-That's what I like to see.
-Yeah.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.819
Oh, my God.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.947
This is normal
charter activity.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.949
Yachting is like Neverland,
it's not real.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.035
* Hey, baby, hey *

02:40.076 --> 02:41.286
* What's your phone number *

02:44.956 --> 02:47.334
First time I had sex in
Florida was on a jet-ski.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.461
-Oh, okay.
-Wait, you've had sex?

02:49.502 --> 02:51.004
Being a woman on deck,

02:51.046 --> 02:52.547
you do feel like you
have to work harder.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.591
-Wrap, wrap, wrap.
-Take it up, take it up.

02:54.632 --> 02:58.053
Do it a 110 percent
or don't do it at all.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.930
I might be a pretty face,
but I know how to rock it.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.849
No.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.809
Excellent, Miami.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.478
Bring it on.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.272
All my life fits in a backpack.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.284
[speaks foreign language]

03:23.286 --> 03:25.455
I've just wet myself.

03:25.497 --> 03:30.126
People would describe me
as a sensational,

03:30.168 --> 03:33.505
stunning, hot mess
crazy bitch.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.642
We are going to work
your asses to the bone.

03:45.684 --> 03:48.395
Everybody literally is like,
we need somebody faster.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.605
Okay, then you ----ing do it.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.731
Woo!

03:51.773 --> 03:53.316
Yachting's not all
fun and games.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.402
You have a problem with me
for no Goddamn ----ing reason.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.903
No, I don't.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.279
-It's deadly serious.
-We're gonna hit.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.572
Oh!

03:59.614 --> 04:01.032
It will chew your
little dumb ass out

04:01.074 --> 04:02.617
and spit you out in a heartbeat.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.411
Whoa!

04:05.245 --> 04:06.830
<i>Prepare to abandon ship.</i>

04:06.871 --> 04:08.998
Y'all are gonna make
me ----ing quit.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.166
[sobs]

04:10.208 --> 04:11.334
We wouldn't mind.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.044
Bye!

04:13.086 --> 04:15.422
What a horrible group of people.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.318
Wow, she is big.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.154
Oh, for God's sake.

04:39.195 --> 04:44.034
Why is it on every CV they
always go "self-motivated?"

04:44.075 --> 04:48.288
Oh, my God, it's huge.

04:48.329 --> 04:49.622
Oh, this is brilliant.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.332
Where the hell am I?

04:51.374 --> 04:54.711
It's so nice!
You're kidding me.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.005
Right, well, they could have
made the beds, at least.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.466
Let's go find El Capitan.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.633
[knocking]

05:00.675 --> 05:02.093
-Fraser!
-Lovely to see you.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.386
Good to see you again.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.138
Gosh, it's so good to be back!

05:05.180 --> 05:07.349
I know you're gonna shine this
year, you shined last year.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.725
Thank you, sir.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.770
I left My Seanna and
I went back to the Med,

05:11.811 --> 05:14.981
and I've been a chief
for a season now.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.067
The kind of boss I wanna be,
I wanna be a friend,

05:17.108 --> 05:18.693
but I also want to be a leader.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.320
But I'm gonna try and see
if I can merge both personal

05:20.362 --> 05:23.990
and professional together and
create something wonderful.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.659
Here are your stews.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.828
Alissa, oh, brilliant.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.749
This one here is gonna
be a floater, Camille.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.669
You're gonna
share her with the deck,

05:35.710 --> 05:37.671
but primarily working with you.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.339
Interesting.
This is great.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.507
It's a big boat.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.342
Calf muscles are
gonna be burning.

05:42.384 --> 05:46.096
It's 197 feet, 1,093 tons.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.682
The state rooms are bigger,
the hallways are longer.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.851
We've got an extra deck,
that's another flight of stairs.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.938
The deck stew,
she's just splitting up

05:54.979 --> 05:57.107
her duties between deck
and interior.

05:57.148 --> 06:00.610
Everybody else has got
one boss, she's got two.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.070
We pick up tomorrow.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.571
As usual, it's a sh-- show.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.823
This is great!

06:04.864 --> 06:06.116
It's gonna work out well,
I think.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.200
This is really cool, okay.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.368
I'm gonna see you around, yeah?

06:08.410 --> 06:09.994
-Yes, you will, sir.
-All right.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.246
-Thank you so much, Fraser.
-Thanks for welcoming back.

06:11.287 --> 06:12.330
Mm.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.998
I don't know where to begin.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.754
Oh, God.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.258
Oh, God, look at that face.

06:23.299 --> 06:26.344
Oh, jeez.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.762
Hello, Rache.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.223
-Permission to board.
-Granted.

06:30.265 --> 06:33.226
I'm so excited I get
to see my boat daddy again.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.602
Boat Pop-Pop's there.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.147
Please, Captain Lee,
don't sh-- on me.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.399
I know you like to eat
a lot of ass.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.735
I'm gonna eat somebody's
ass for dinner.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.610
Ooh!

06:42.652 --> 06:46.865
And you are what you eat, but...

06:46.906 --> 06:48.742
We got a brand-new boat, big.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.161
-I saw it on the dock.
-We got room.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.163
You are gonna have
your own cabin, my dear.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.414
I love that.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.749
You're gonna knock
their socks off.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.916
I'm ready to do it.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.501
All right, sweetie.
You look great.

06:58.543 --> 07:01.171
-Thank you, Captain.
-Spectacular.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.256
-Hello!
-Hello?

07:03.298 --> 07:04.591
-Ah!
-Ah!

07:04.632 --> 07:06.926
How are you!

07:06.968 --> 07:08.887
-Hi!
-You look gorgeous!

07:08.928 --> 07:10.430
Yeah, so do you,
you look fantastic.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.514
Look at you!

07:11.556 --> 07:12.932
-Hello?
-You must be Ross.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.601
I am Ross, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

07:14.642 --> 07:15.977
This is your new home.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.187
I love this, ooh.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.231
This is great, the lighting
in here as well.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.232
Pretty big, hey?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.609
Just by the size of it,

07:22.650 --> 07:23.693
it'll probably be
a good layout for me.

07:23.735 --> 07:24.903
This boat is enormous.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.237
You've got your own cabin.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.655
I saw that.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.200
-Bitch!
-Thank you.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.618
Ross, you've been a busy guy.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.204
Yeah, I've worked on
about 26 yachts.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.705
That works for me.

07:35.747 --> 07:39.417
You are going to have
Katie as one of your deckhands,

07:39.459 --> 07:41.002
and you have Mr. Willoughby.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.962
-Sounds Australian.
-Yeah.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.256
Tony. He's gonna be
your greenest deckhand.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.258
This one is going
to double as a stew.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.635
Okay.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.929
I've got 11 years
of experience on yachts.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.599
For me, the hardest element
is social dynamics.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.601
I do tend to keep
myself back a little bit,

07:56.643 --> 07:58.978
reserve some kind of
tactical chess game.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.730
I'm not one to walk
on board, say,

08:00.772 --> 08:04.609
"Hello, I'm Ross,
I like group sex."

08:04.651 --> 08:06.903
-Guests coming on tomorrow.
-Extravagant.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.405
-Welcome aboard, Ross.
-Thank you very much.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.614
You're welcome, sir.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.449
-All right.
-My own suite, ooh.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.827
-Yeah!
-Whoa!

08:13.868 --> 08:15.412
Hello, Fraser, nice to meet you.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.996
-How you doing, Fraser?
-I'm Ross. Nice to meet you.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.164
Ross, how are you?
You're bosun, right?

08:18.206 --> 08:19.833
I am, that's correct.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.252
I'm gonna give you the choice
of where you want to live.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.503
Go for it.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.504
And I do snore
like a train, but...

08:24.546 --> 08:26.047
Brilliant.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.509
So excited.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.344
I have to pee again already.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.846
Nervous pee-er.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.098
-Hello!
-Hi, how are you?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.850
I'm Fraser, I'm going
to be your chief.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.518
Alissa, nice to meet you.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.853
Nice to meet you!

08:41.104 --> 08:42.355
Whoa, that's fancy.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.191
How do I open it, bitch.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.526
How long have you
been yachting for?

08:46.568 --> 08:47.944
About a year and a half.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.154
Okay.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.530
I was a second stew,
so lots of housekeeping.

08:50.572 --> 08:51.740
Okay, do you enjoy
making cocktails?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.074
-I do, I do.
-Yeah.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.868
And the guests enjoy me,
for some reason, so.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.037
I can so see why.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.539
My ultimate goal in yachting
is to make

08:59.581 --> 09:01.875
as much ----ing money
as possible,

09:01.916 --> 09:05.545
meet as many high-end
people as possible,

09:05.587 --> 09:07.714
mooch off them,
and live their life.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.633
-Get into a uniform.
-Cool.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.218
All right, I'll see you soon.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.345
She is lovely.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.598
Oh, my God this is
actually happening.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.438
Chef is in.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.398
-I'm Hayley, your stewardess.
-I'm Fraser, nice to meet you.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.608
Oh, lovely to meet you.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.026
Lovely to meet you too,
welcome aboard.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.235
Thank you.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.112
I'm gonna take you
to get into a uniform,

09:31.154 --> 09:32.864
-and we'll go from there.
-Amazing, thank you.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.783
It's absolutely gorgeous.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.159
It's brilliant, isn't it?

09:36.201 --> 09:37.494
The humidity does not
improve my hair, though.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.828
It's a bit much.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.914
The three things I like
most about myself...

09:40.955 --> 09:42.207
it's quite obvious, isn't it...

09:42.248 --> 09:45.251
ass, tits, hair...
ka-ching!

09:45.293 --> 09:47.170
-Hi.
-Hey!

09:47.212 --> 09:48.755
Hi, I'm Hayley.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.340
I love your hair!

09:50.382 --> 09:52.300
I was gonna just say I love
how, like, big your hair is!

09:54.969 --> 09:56.304
Wow.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.809
-Hi.
-Hello.

10:00.850 --> 10:01.851
I'm Ben, nice to meet you.

10:01.893 --> 10:02.852
-Katie.
-Katie?

10:02.894 --> 10:03.937
Nice to meet you.

10:03.978 --> 10:04.938
-Hey.
-Hello, how are you?

10:04.979 --> 10:06.439
Good morning or afternoon,

10:06.481 --> 10:07.607
I'm not sure which one it
is at the moment.

10:07.649 --> 10:08.733
-Yeah, right?
-Ben.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.734
Ben, I'm Ross, nice to meet you.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.152
-Ross.
-Katie.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.445
-Katie, lovely to meet you too.
-Nice to meet you.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.571
-I'm the bosun.
-Awesome.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.241
Well, welcome aboard.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.369
Okay, so I've had a brief
look through your CVs.

10:19.411 --> 10:22.706
Hayley, I'd like to speak to you
and see what your experience is.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.417
And is that what
you enjoy being?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.459
-Yes.
-Right.

10:26.501 --> 10:27.794
I actually love housekeeping.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.005
-Boom! Boom!
-Yeah, I do love housekeeping.

10:30.046 --> 10:30.797
Boom!

10:30.839 --> 10:32.132
-Hi, welcome.
-Hi!

10:32.173 --> 10:33.383
-I'm Ross.
-Tony, nice to meet you.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.343
So, this is the deck team,
I believe.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.012
-Oh, wow.
-Awesome.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.973
Let's go down to the cabins,
find your cabins, and settle in.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.933
We actually have a deck stew.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.144
Quite a large vessel here.

10:44.185 --> 10:47.230
But my priority right now is
we've got a charter tomorrow.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.190
I'm gonna send both
of you down to cabins.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.400
Okay, yeah.

10:50.442 --> 10:51.609
And we're just gonna
get them all done.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.819
What have you got in here?

10:52.861 --> 10:54.446
-There might be a body in there.
-Yeah.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.822
Oh, my gosh.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.490
-Hello, what's your name?
-Camille.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.992
Camille, okay, and you're
the deck stew, is that right?

10:59.034 --> 11:00.368
Hi, I am the deck stew.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.246
-This is so exciting!
-This is so exciting!

11:04.497 --> 11:06.207
Bigger than what I'm used to.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.461
Nice, bro.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.171
So, this is our crew quarters.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.505
-Ross, have you met Camille?
-Hello.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.132
-I have not.
-Hi.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.427
Ross, like the discount store.

11:17.469 --> 11:18.970
-Can you help me with my bag?
-Yeah, sure.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.472
-Are you the bosun?
-I am.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.140
I'm the deck stew, so
I'm not exactly sure

11:22.182 --> 11:23.767
where you guys
will be needing me.

11:23.808 --> 11:24.768
-Camille?
-Camille.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.519
Okay, perfect.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.938
I'm attracted to a few of
the girls on the boat.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.403
-Thank you, Ross.
-Yeah, sure.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.404
All right, I'll come back later.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.781
Yeah.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.449
I'm gonna try and be
as good as I can,

11:39.491 --> 11:41.076
but then I'm also not very
good at that kind of thing.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.294
Can we just chat quickly
about Camille?

11:53.254 --> 11:54.005
Yes.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.132
So much stuff.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.384
We're going to share
her a little bit.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.885
Right.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.762
Just because I'm doing
interior and exterior,

12:00.804 --> 12:02.806
like, I guess I get,
like, double.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.766
So, I'm going to just throw
her in

12:04.808 --> 12:06.434
on the interior side of things,

12:06.476 --> 12:08.436
and then whenever you need her,
she'll be all yours.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.021
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.273
I do surf.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.780
Oh, Dios, man, that
place is famous, bro.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.115
-Where are you from?
-Ohio.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.616
Okay, I was gonna say
I hear a little, like...

12:21.658 --> 12:22.951
-Yes, yeah.
-Midwestern.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.869
Yep, yep, but I live
in Ft. Lauderdale.

12:24.911 --> 12:25.870
-Okay, nice.
-What about you?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.122
The South.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.498
There you go, the South,
that's awesome.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.041
-Southern girl, you know.
-That's awesome.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.126
I'm from a small town
in Mississippi

12:31.167 --> 12:32.460
that was too small for me,

12:32.502 --> 12:34.337
and I was very ready
to get out of there.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.631
Growing up, people
wouldn't invite me to the party

12:36.673 --> 12:39.551
because I ended up being
the center of attention.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.677
I'm not trying to be.

12:40.719 --> 12:41.970
I love to be a little extra,

12:42.012 --> 12:43.596
it's so ----ing boring
to not be.

12:43.638 --> 12:47.308
But does that sound egotistical?

12:47.350 --> 12:49.644
You're going to be
with us most of the time,

12:49.686 --> 12:51.688
but if you can just focus on
the master in its entirety...

12:51.730 --> 12:53.148
That's the hot tub.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.150
-Wait...
-I know, it's fantastic.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.317
Anyone got experience
with anchorings?

12:56.359 --> 12:57.527
-Big anchors, yeah.
-Yeah.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.987
Yeah? Okay.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.739
This is dangerous equipment.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.824
The fernickety thing about
this is

13:02.866 --> 13:04.200
that if you bring it up too far,

13:04.242 --> 13:07.662
just the tiniest amount,
it gets stuck.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.248
It's about four spins up
and four spins down.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.332
Copy that.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.251
How much docking
have you all done?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.544
-I've done a few, big...
-Yeah?

13:14.586 --> 13:16.212
-Big boats.
-Nice.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.922
I'm just gonna do whatever
you need me to do, because...

13:17.964 --> 13:19.382
All right, Tony.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.009
I have a pair of hands ready
for anything, you know?

13:21.051 --> 13:22.927
Yes, I appreciate that
and I love...

13:22.969 --> 13:25.138
The smile's perfect.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.015
Attention all crew,
I need everyone

13:27.057 --> 13:29.017
in the sky lounge for
a staff meeting.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.018
Copy that.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.686
And would you bring me a coffee?

13:31.728 --> 13:33.229
Copy that, Captain.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.899
Well, I've got no
----ing coffee pods.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.567
How does this sh-- work?

13:37.609 --> 13:38.985
-Hi!
-Hello.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.988
Arr, what a motley-looking
bunch we got here.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.365
We haven't got coffee or cream.

13:43.406 --> 13:44.991
Thirty ----ing million
dollar yacht

13:45.033 --> 13:46.242
and we don't have
coffee or cream?

13:46.284 --> 13:47.660
Can you believe that,
and no coffee.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.205
Okay, we might as well
get the party started.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.458
I am your captain.
My name is Captain Lee.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.001
I have two rules...

13:55.043 --> 13:58.922
don't embarrass the boat, and
do not embarrass yourselves.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.382
I've got a pocket
full of plane tickets

14:00.423 --> 14:03.009
that I have no
problem handing out.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.177
Are we clear on that?

14:04.219 --> 14:05.637
-Yes.
-Copy that.

14:05.679 --> 14:06.930
Okay.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.557
[sighs]

14:09.599 --> 14:11.184
One other thing
I did wanna cover,

14:11.226 --> 14:14.104
I am a little incapacitated.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.272
I have a nerve issue
on my left side.

14:16.314 --> 14:20.110
So, I am going to depend
on you guys in some areas.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.821
I had back surgery
before I left.

14:22.862 --> 14:26.032
The worst is behind me now,
and the doctors have assured me

14:26.074 --> 14:27.617
that I'm just gonna
continue to get better.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.286
And I said, well,
I'm going to work.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.580
I wanna set records this season.

14:32.622 --> 14:36.001
I want all the cash
we can possibly get.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.293
We pick up tomorrow.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.795
-Let's go to work.
-Woo!

14:38.837 --> 14:40.630
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.427
I just don't even know what
to do with this right now.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.220
What are those?

14:47.262 --> 14:48.972
-Like, look...
-A massive penis.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.600
What is this absolute
pile of sh--?

14:56.771 --> 14:58.148
Ladies, I love that.
This looks fantastic.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.316
Cool, thank you so much.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.902
Alissa knows what she's doing,
and she's doing it very well.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.821
Everything she's doing
is very polished

15:04.863 --> 15:06.197
and very, very structured.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.783
-Hayley, not so much.
-Okay, so like this?

15:08.825 --> 15:10.535
-Exactly right, yeah.
-Oh!

15:10.577 --> 15:12.078
Things seem to be a little
bit all over the place,

15:12.120 --> 15:14.622
but she's very,
very enthusiastic.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.709
I'm happy with them both so
far, so, so far, so good...

15:17.751 --> 15:18.793
knock on wood.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.128
Where have I come from?

15:20.170 --> 15:23.006
Hell, that's where
I've come from.

15:26.176 --> 15:28.678
All crew, all crew,
provisions are arriving.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.055
<i>Copy that.</i>

15:30.096 --> 15:31.639
They're bringing the food,
oh, gosh.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.391
So, basically, we just
wanna get it all on.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.642
Then we can start
organizing it, I think.

15:34.684 --> 15:35.685
-Sure.
-Yeah, perfect.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.315
Oh, my God,
it's so hot, isn't it?

15:41.983 --> 15:44.152
This is a hot hell.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.656
Oh, I'm sweating
like an absolute swine.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.951
Jesus Christ, this is
way ----ing down here.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.078
How many more, Ross?

15:53.119 --> 15:54.287
-That's it.
-Woo!

15:54.329 --> 15:57.374
Oh, Jesus ----ing Christ.

15:57.415 --> 16:00.001
All right, what
the [bleep] was I doing?

16:00.043 --> 16:01.586
Oh, yeah.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.129
This is a massive boat.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.923
So, that means
she's a big bitch.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.509
Sometimes, when you have
all these many decks on a boat,

16:07.550 --> 16:09.511
it becomes harder,
just because

16:09.552 --> 16:11.221
you're running through
so many levels.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.889
[bleep] me running.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.392
I have to go all the way down,
too, to my dry store

16:15.433 --> 16:17.352
and my walk-in and
my freezer as well.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.521
Cranky Rachel might kick
in in a second.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.232
Oh, these stairs are
gonna definitely build

16:22.273 --> 16:24.359
some good calves
and a nice, hard ass.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.779
Oh [bleep] yes!

16:27.821 --> 16:28.863
Yeah.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.198
Bye, guys.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.535
What is your favorite food?

16:33.576 --> 16:35.203
Anything that's not healthy.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.663
No matter what.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.039
See, Miami-style,
we'd work in our bikinis.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.541
Oh.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.751
So, Monday, Tuesday, I would
eat whatever I wanted,

16:41.793 --> 16:46.965
Wednesday, Thursday
I would drop all carbs

16:47.007 --> 16:49.300
so I could be in a bikini,
pulling lines, fenders.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.760
I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.847
I lived back in the woods,
so we'd go hiking.

16:53.888 --> 16:56.850
I was the only one that kind
of ventured out, decided to,

16:56.891 --> 17:00.353
you know, move to Florida, and
I fell into yachting right away.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.730
I like to challenge myself.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.398
I'm gonna do everything
the boys can do.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.567
Like a badass,
I ----ing love that.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.110
The day charters got old for me.

17:07.152 --> 17:08.695
That's why doing
this is so cool.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.741
Fraser, Fraser, Lee.

17:12.782 --> 17:13.783
Go ahead.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.702
Can you grab Rachel
and the bosun

17:15.744 --> 17:17.412
and meet me in the
crew mess

17:17.454 --> 17:19.080
for our preference
sheet meeting, please?

17:19.122 --> 17:20.665
Copy that.

17:20.707 --> 17:21.708
Yikesies.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.087
Why is this not organized?

17:26.129 --> 17:27.756
How you doing, Fraser?

17:27.797 --> 17:30.592
I'm exhausted, but well.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.093
Good, we're just
getting started.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.094
Yeah, well.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.764
First one of the season.

17:35.805 --> 17:36.639
Thank you.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.559
Our charter guest is Peng Lim.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.936
He's an in-demand
tax professional.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.939
Peng is gonna be joined by his
best friends for his birthday.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.442
Peng' friends are planning
on some birthday surprises,

17:47.484 --> 17:49.611
including an all-day
celebration

17:49.652 --> 17:52.238
with images of Peng's
face decorating anything.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.948
What if it floats
in the day head?

17:53.990 --> 17:55.325
[laughing]

17:56.534 --> 17:58.745
First evening, they
want a rave-style party.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.622
They would like to continue
the festivities

18:00.663 --> 18:03.750
with a Zen day on the beach,
and in the evening,

18:03.792 --> 18:06.753
Playboy mansion theme party
with an exotic dancer.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.421
Young, sexy male.

18:08.463 --> 18:09.798
Oh, interesting twist there.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.883
Did you not pick it up going
through these?

18:11.925 --> 18:12.926
No, no.

18:14.552 --> 18:18.431
Oh, I thought he was connected
quite closely to Madame Breasts.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.642
Somehow, I think not.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.769
As an added bonus,
primary's friends would love

18:22.811 --> 18:24.729
to surprise him by
having someone jump out

18:24.771 --> 18:26.690
of a large-scale
birthday cake.

18:26.731 --> 18:30.068
Well, we know we're
leaving my old ass out of that.

18:30.110 --> 18:33.321
Carry on, folks.
Thank you.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.864
We've got so much to do.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.741
We've gone mad.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.451
What's your sign?

18:38.493 --> 18:40.912
I'm a Pisces, so I'm just
basically an emotional mess.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.539
My boyfriend's a Gemini,

18:42.580 --> 18:45.125
and we're the most
uncompatible signs.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.501
You know what my mom told me?

18:46.543 --> 18:48.795
She said, "Love never
lasts at the beach."

18:48.837 --> 18:49.879
I think that's so true.

18:49.921 --> 18:53.508
I'm definitely attracted
to the bad boys.

18:53.550 --> 18:57.345
I dated a college SEC football
player, a quarterback.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.806
Football in the South,
it's no ----ing joke.

18:59.848 --> 19:02.017
Like, grown men are,
like, mega-fans of,

19:02.058 --> 19:03.810
like, 17-year-old boys.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.146
It's, like, so ----ing weird,
I just don't understand it.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.355
Wait, so what does that mean?

19:07.397 --> 19:08.690
So, love never lasts
at the beach

19:08.732 --> 19:10.650
because people are tan,
they're hot.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.610
To be fair,
I do live by a beach,

19:12.652 --> 19:13.903
so that does completely...

19:13.945 --> 19:15.905
you just described me,
didn't you?

19:16.948 --> 19:18.074
Okay.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.535
Should we get up at 6:30?

19:20.577 --> 19:22.162
All right, thanks for
an awesome first day.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.705
-Yeah.
-Thanks, man.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.331
How long did you say you've
been in yachting for?

19:25.373 --> 19:27.459
Four years, on and off.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.752
Done a lot of waitressing,

19:28.793 --> 19:30.003
I was always doing
front-of-house jobs.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.004
Nice.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.380
I did...

19:34.090 --> 19:35.216
And I did that for three years.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.259
-I saw that.
-Did you see that?

19:36.301 --> 19:37.719
-That is great.
-Mm-hmm.

19:37.761 --> 19:40.805
I was always in and
out of the yacht industry.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.933
It's like an ex-lover
that you used to spend

19:43.975 --> 19:47.145
a lot of time with, and
you really liked the sex.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.606
Didn't really wanna commit,
but occasionally,

19:49.647 --> 19:51.858
you just wanna dip
back in there a little bit.

19:51.900 --> 19:56.154
I've got my own business at
the moment, doing aesthetics.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.781
So, I do Botox and fillers.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.325
So, freshly done five days ago,
so I imagine it's still...

20:00.367 --> 20:01.826
Where'd you get it?

20:01.868 --> 20:03.244
You're can only do it
from here up, can't you?

20:03.286 --> 20:04.537
Oh, my God!

20:04.579 --> 20:06.748
People are doing
that to their grundels.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.750
Smooth balls?

20:08.792 --> 20:10.418
So, it relaxes their balls?

20:10.460 --> 20:11.586
I don't know,
I've never seen it.

20:11.628 --> 20:12.921
This is quite intense.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.214
I don't know,
but I've heard about it.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.590
Botox?

20:15.632 --> 20:17.133
Yes, did you bring some
with you, by the way?

20:17.175 --> 20:18.885
-No.
-For [bleep]'s sake.

20:20.303 --> 20:21.680
Spectacular.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.223
All right, darling,
I'll see you around.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.391
We'll start in the morning.

20:24.432 --> 20:25.600
Good night.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.018
Ow.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.645
Oh, a shower sounds pretty
good right now, actually.

20:28.687 --> 20:31.856
Let's be on deck
between 6:30 and 7:00.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.861
I mean, really?

20:38.822 --> 20:40.657
I'll do this, if
it takes me all night.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.742
For [bleep]'s sake, girls.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.369
This is ghastly.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.955
I'm feeling the stress.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.456
I need to give
my absolute all to this.

20:48.498 --> 20:49.624
This is everything.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.002
I grew up being
hideously bullied,

20:52.043 --> 20:54.963
and so there is this
looming voice

20:55.005 --> 20:56.548
that's always
in the back of my head

20:56.589 --> 20:58.550
telling me I'm not
quite good enough.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.427
It's never-ending!

21:00.468 --> 21:02.470
Oh, God, this is foul.

21:02.512 --> 21:05.015
The boat's huge, and
I really didn't know

21:05.056 --> 21:06.558
what I was facing, and

21:06.599 --> 21:08.560
it's far worse than
I thought it would ever be.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.894
So, yeah, I'm freaking out.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.439
I am crumbling under
pressure here.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.817
Coming up...

21:15.859 --> 21:17.902
For anyone who wants
to use the bathroom...

21:17.944 --> 21:19.237
Is there soap?

21:19.279 --> 21:20.947
Yeah, there will be.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.992
Guests have been on board for
10 minutes, and we ----ed up.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.963
[alarm sounds]

21:38.965 --> 21:40.467
As soon as I wake up,
I'm like,

21:40.508 --> 21:41.885
let's ----ing go!

21:41.926 --> 21:43.178
Right, that's because
you're, like,

21:43.219 --> 21:44.721
seven years younger than me.

21:46.598 --> 21:48.350
So, we've got two
hose connection points.

21:48.391 --> 21:51.019
We've got one here, and there's
one back starboard aft there,

21:51.061 --> 21:52.562
-and when you...
-So, just water everything?

21:52.604 --> 21:54.898
Yeah, what I would do
is start from the front.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.691
Yeah.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.701
All right, so it's gonna be only
this, and what about the teak?

22:06.743 --> 22:08.912
No, not with the teak.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.924
Just go until
people start dying.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.217
Cool.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.885
-Fras.
-Hey.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.261
Have you come across a fruit
bowl that you'd like to use?

22:25.303 --> 22:26.888
-Sure.
-And 'cuter boards.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.391
"Cooter boards."
Charcuterie?

22:29.432 --> 22:31.768
Yes, a mélange of my meats,

22:31.810 --> 22:33.895
thinly sliced,
laid on a platter.

22:33.937 --> 22:35.814
As much as I love
talking about your cooter,

22:35.855 --> 22:37.065
let's end that there.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.149
All righty.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.653
Yeah, [bleep].

22:45.448 --> 22:46.866
-Okay.
-Yeah.

22:46.908 --> 22:49.285
Interior, interior,
would I be able to grab you

22:49.327 --> 22:52.914
in the sky lounge, please?

22:54.165 --> 22:55.750
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

22:55.792 --> 22:57.168
What I'd do now is I'd probably
try and get a chamois,

22:57.210 --> 23:00.130
some K2R, and a bit of...
Yeah, on each deck.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.131
-Copy.
-Okay.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.298
We can do that.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.550
Take a seat, ladies.

23:03.591 --> 23:04.718
I'm going to go through
a couple things.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.928
Got your responsibility
list here,

23:06.970 --> 23:08.513
and if something's
not been done,

23:08.555 --> 23:11.307
I will know who's
responsible for it.

23:11.349 --> 23:14.144
Last night,
I was having a mental breakdown

23:14.185 --> 23:17.147
and I realized
I can't do everything.

23:17.188 --> 23:18.773
So, I need to learn how
to delegate.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.568
Here is my bible.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.069
Get reading.

23:23.111 --> 23:26.114
I don't know any of
you more than a few hours,

23:26.156 --> 23:28.825
but I'm gonna go off
of experience.

23:28.867 --> 23:31.327
Alissa, I'm thinking of
making you my second.

23:31.369 --> 23:32.954
Okay.

23:32.996 --> 23:36.499
So, I need you to be in charge
of helping the girls out.

23:36.541 --> 23:37.667
Cool.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.211
I am going to absolutely
smash it.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.964
I just wanna focus on
my triangle of importance...

23:43.006 --> 23:46.843
Captain Lee, Fraser,
whoever's paying me.

23:46.885 --> 23:50.388
The people not in the triangle,
do your work, please.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.598
Yay!

23:51.639 --> 23:53.058
Thanks, guys.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.894
Your priorities today are to
get laundry in a place.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.187
Do you want me to
do the day head?

23:57.228 --> 23:58.646
-Please.
-I'm looking forward to it.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.482
<i>-Fraser, Fraser, Ross.</i>
<i>-Go ahead.</i>

24:00.523 --> 24:01.691
Is it okay if we have
Camille now,

24:01.733 --> 24:03.109
so we can talk about
some docking?

24:03.151 --> 24:05.320
Yeah, Camille, head back
down when you're ready.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.529
<i>Copy.</i>

24:06.571 --> 24:08.198
Do you keep your
warm water somewhere?

24:08.239 --> 24:10.617
I just pop them there, or
I just put them on my tits.

24:10.658 --> 24:12.744
What if you just like,
opened it up and...

24:12.786 --> 24:15.205
-Welcome.
-Hi, everybody.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.539
Nice.

24:16.581 --> 24:17.665
Thank you.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.959
You don't ever say that to me.

24:20.001 --> 24:22.128
Right, I've drawn
a picture of the boat.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.756
I'm gonna have Ben doing
these three lines.

24:24.798 --> 24:26.591
-Okay.
-Katie here.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.093
Perfect.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.302
Tony, you might be going round
in circles just a here.

24:29.344 --> 24:31.596
Camille, along the middle here,

24:31.638 --> 24:34.015
in case Katie needs
a hand over here.

24:34.057 --> 24:35.392
Okay.

24:35.433 --> 24:37.310
I worked as a deck stew before,
but on a small boat.

24:37.352 --> 24:41.606
But if I had to be one,
I would be on the deck.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.650
I like being outside
with the boys.

24:43.692 --> 24:46.194
It's a vibe,
put the sunglasses on

24:46.236 --> 24:49.864
----ing drink a Coca-Cola,
yeah.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.658
-All right.
-A lot of info.

24:53.118 --> 24:55.286
Come on, do it for Mommy,
you know you ----ing like it.

24:57.455 --> 24:59.708
Suck my...

24:59.749 --> 25:00.750
[coughing]

25:00.792 --> 25:01.918
[bleep] suckers.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.378
Have a ----ing party.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.347
I have no idea,
that's why I'm asking you.

25:14.389 --> 25:16.057
Yeah, gimme one minute.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.351
This girl has got me
----ing running around

25:18.393 --> 25:20.812
doing sh-- for her.

25:20.854 --> 25:22.689
Grab a chamois and
just make things nice.

25:22.731 --> 25:24.190
We'll tighten up
this line again.

25:24.232 --> 25:25.900
Yep.

25:28.695 --> 25:29.946
Brilliant.

25:29.988 --> 25:30.947
Okay, can you handle
the napkin thing,

25:30.989 --> 25:32.532
or do you want me to do it?

25:32.574 --> 25:34.200
Because I just want it done,
like, as soon as possible.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.910
Dude, I don't know
where the napkins are.

25:35.952 --> 25:36.911
That's what I'm saying,
are you gonna ask Fraser

25:36.953 --> 25:37.954
or do you want me to?

25:37.996 --> 25:39.622
-You can ask him.
-Okay.

25:39.664 --> 25:43.168
Camille's giving me a little
bit of a, like, attitude.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.919
<i>Fraser, Alissa.</i>

25:44.961 --> 25:46.254
Have you seen any napkins?

25:46.296 --> 25:48.715
Lower stew pantry,
the galley pantry.

25:48.757 --> 25:50.425
I would have never
suspected that.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.844
That's why you can just ask him.

25:52.886 --> 25:56.431
It's just annoying, but we'll
see how that progresses.

26:00.518 --> 26:01.978
You can't find napkins?

26:02.020 --> 26:03.938
<i>Alissa, I've got</i>
<i>cocktail napkins.</i>

26:03.980 --> 26:05.398
All the towels are washed
and ready to go, right?

26:05.440 --> 26:06.983
They are ready to go.

26:07.025 --> 26:10.362
Attention all crew, we have
one hour till guest arrival.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.404
No, no, no.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.492
Literally need you to spray
and just go like this.

26:15.533 --> 26:17.494
-Yes.
-Hayley, hand towels...

26:17.535 --> 26:19.162
-roll them up nicely.
-Okay.

26:20.538 --> 26:22.665
Right, so let's just
have a little final look.

26:22.707 --> 26:24.376
-We looking ready?
-Yeah, looks good.

26:24.417 --> 26:27.671
-Everything's looking pretty.
-Yeah, that's pretty good.

26:27.712 --> 26:29.673
Can we think about
getting into our whites?

26:29.714 --> 26:31.424
-Okay.
-That's what I like to see!

26:33.885 --> 26:35.470
Let's go and shower
and get changed up.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.309
Ooh, I look fancy in this.

26:41.351 --> 26:42.644
Shiny bitch.

26:42.686 --> 26:43.853
Maybe you could deal
with whatever's on the edge

26:43.895 --> 26:45.313
of that bar there, Tony.

26:45.355 --> 26:46.981
<i>Attention all crew,</i>
<i>attention all crew.</i>

26:47.023 --> 26:50.902
I need everybody on the aft deck
in their whites in five.

26:56.616 --> 27:00.036
* Going on a boat *

27:00.078 --> 27:01.204
-I have to pee again.
-I do, too.

27:01.246 --> 27:02.914
-You got it?
-Yeah, yep.

27:02.956 --> 27:05.959
Interior, let's just knock
this out of the park.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.752
That'll work,
for the time we had.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.254
Let's go.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.463
<i>All crew, all crew,</i>
<i>we can see the guests</i>

27:10.505 --> 27:11.881
<i>walking down the dock.</i>

27:11.923 --> 27:13.299
Oh, my ----ing God,
we've gotta get out.

27:13.341 --> 27:14.676
Here they come.

27:14.718 --> 27:15.927
Wait, do you guys know what
flag that is up there?

27:15.969 --> 27:18.096
-It's St. Lucia.
-Oh, cute.

27:19.389 --> 27:20.890
God, help us.

27:20.932 --> 27:21.891
Coming up...

27:21.933 --> 27:23.643
Alissa, do you want side plates?

27:23.685 --> 27:25.061
"Do you want side plates?"

27:25.103 --> 27:26.312
I'm asking you, look
at your stripes.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.939
No, I'm asking you
too, because...

27:27.981 --> 27:29.024
Look at your stripes,
you're on service.

27:39.617 --> 27:40.368
This is quite nerve-wracking.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.204
Smile.

27:43.246 --> 27:45.290
-Hi.
-Welcome aboard.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.624
-Peng.
-Captain Lee.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.376
-Hola!
-Oh, thank you.

27:48.418 --> 27:49.377
A fresh towel for you.

27:49.419 --> 27:50.503
How you doing, buddy?

27:50.545 --> 27:51.880
Oh, perfect, thank you so much.

27:51.921 --> 27:53.882
-I'm Quai.
-Hello, Quai.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.216
What was I supposed
to do with that?

27:55.258 --> 27:56.551
Wash your hands.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.219
-You, like, daub your...
-There you go, baby.

27:58.261 --> 27:59.554
Thank you.

27:59.596 --> 28:01.806
Welcome aboard, and
welcome to St. Lucia.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.767
We've got a great
few days planned out

28:03.808 --> 28:05.268
for you, birthday boy.

28:05.310 --> 28:06.561
-Thank you.
-Woo!

28:06.603 --> 28:07.979
-Woohoo!
-Happy birthday.

28:08.021 --> 28:09.564
I am going to have Mr. Olender
give you guys a tour

28:09.606 --> 28:12.067
of the vessel, and
then if you don't mind,

28:12.108 --> 28:13.777
we'll just get off this dock
and get the party started.

28:13.818 --> 28:15.111
-Thank you, perfect.
-Yes!

28:15.153 --> 28:17.113
-That work?
-I'll cheers to that.

28:17.155 --> 28:18.323
Saddle up and go to work.

28:18.365 --> 28:19.741
Stairs?
Are you guys serious?

28:19.783 --> 28:21.618
So, this is our bridge deck aft.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.453
Oh, this is so cute,
I love that.

28:23.495 --> 28:25.205
Oh!

28:25.246 --> 28:26.581
Oh my God.

28:26.623 --> 28:27.791
-I'm so sorry.
-That's all right.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.876
What have they
got in this thing?

28:29.918 --> 28:31.169
Oh, my Lord.

28:31.211 --> 28:33.880
So, we've got a lovely
lounging area here.

28:33.922 --> 28:35.674
-I have to pee!
-Hot tub.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.133
-Hot tub.
-Wow, yes.

28:37.175 --> 28:40.053
Now, for anyone who wants
to use the bathroom...

28:40.095 --> 28:42.722
Is there soap?

28:42.764 --> 28:45.475
-Is there soap?
-Yeah, there will be.

28:45.517 --> 28:49.020
Guests have been on board for
10 minutes and we ----ed up.

28:49.062 --> 28:50.146
So, that's good.

28:50.188 --> 28:52.023
Interior, can we please
get some soap?

28:52.065 --> 28:55.402
And by the way, these
urine stains are not mine.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.153
-There you go.
-Thank you.

28:57.195 --> 28:59.072
Just dip 'em in the hot tub.

28:59.114 --> 29:02.117
I'm so sorry, we can
revisit the soap situation.

29:02.158 --> 29:04.369
-Oh, you're totally fine.
-There we are.

29:04.411 --> 29:06.204
Alissa, do you want side plates?

29:06.246 --> 29:07.497
Do you want side plates?

29:07.539 --> 29:09.457
I'm asking you,
look at your stripes.

29:09.499 --> 29:10.875
No, I'm asking you too.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.085
Look at your stripes,
you're on service.

29:12.127 --> 29:13.378
It doesn't matter.

29:13.420 --> 29:14.796
Yeah, you can bring
side plates, just because.

29:14.838 --> 29:16.006
-You want plates?
-Yeah, sure.

29:16.047 --> 29:17.048
All right.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.636
-This is your quarters.
-There's a library?

29:21.678 --> 29:23.013
-This is all Peng's room?
-Yeah.

29:23.054 --> 29:24.472
-Oh, wow.
-Look at this.

29:24.514 --> 29:25.807
So, will you guys go up there

29:25.849 --> 29:28.351
and take a picture of us
laying down, thank you.

29:28.393 --> 29:29.602
[laughing]

29:29.644 --> 29:30.979
Very good idea.

29:31.021 --> 29:33.148
-Port anchor's ready to go.
-Got it.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.400
I'll probably just
go bow to stern.

29:35.442 --> 29:37.152
Put Benjamin on the bow,

29:37.193 --> 29:39.362
and I'll be down the back,
calling distance.

29:39.404 --> 29:40.864
Okay.

29:40.905 --> 29:42.824
Just stay sharp,
and we'll let 'em know

29:42.866 --> 29:44.034
when we're gonna get underway.

29:44.075 --> 29:45.577
Cool.

29:45.618 --> 29:49.456
We're a new crew, new boat,
new location, new everything.

29:49.497 --> 29:50.999
A lot of pressure.

29:51.041 --> 29:52.417
They'll be pointing
their finger,

29:52.459 --> 29:55.128
"Look at that dumb sh--."

29:55.170 --> 29:57.005
Can't put that toothpaste back
in the tube.

29:57.047 --> 29:58.631
[sighs]

30:00.050 --> 30:01.176
-Three o'clock?
-Three o'clock.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.218
Thank you, thank you.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.219
Your station will be along here.

30:03.261 --> 30:04.471
Got it.

30:04.512 --> 30:05.764
Just making sure fenders
are all good.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.349
Yeah, can we do two
espresso martinis?

30:07.390 --> 30:08.850
Of course.

30:08.892 --> 30:10.018
If you wanna get these
fenders all out of the way.

30:10.060 --> 30:11.061
Yeah.

30:11.102 --> 30:12.228
Ross, you got everybody
in position?

30:12.270 --> 30:13.563
All in position.

30:13.605 --> 30:15.231
For lunch, we were
thinking around 3:00.

30:15.273 --> 30:16.858
That's totally fine, yeah.

30:16.900 --> 30:18.610
All right, let's go
bow to stern,

30:18.651 --> 30:20.695
<i>and let's not burn any daylight</i>
<i>while we're doing it.</i>

30:20.737 --> 30:22.155
I'll do, like,
a spicy margarita.

30:22.197 --> 30:24.699
Cool, I can definitely
do that for you.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.451
Captain, that's all
lines on the bow.

30:26.493 --> 30:27.952
Okay, let's go, go.

30:27.994 --> 30:30.497
Oh, my God, did somebody
make him another margarita?

30:30.538 --> 30:32.207
Guilty.
Sorry, guys.

30:32.248 --> 30:33.667
[laughing]

30:33.708 --> 30:36.211
Go, go, go, Katie.

30:36.252 --> 30:37.212
<i>All lines on board.</i>

30:37.253 --> 30:38.380
<i>Nice work, deck team.</i>

30:38.421 --> 30:39.631
Is this the ocean?

30:39.673 --> 30:42.133
<i>We're outta here.</i>

30:42.175 --> 30:44.344
I guess it's too late to turn
back now, isn't it?

30:44.386 --> 30:45.679
<i>Bring the fenders in,</i>
<i>start lashing them down.</i>

30:45.720 --> 30:47.222
<i>That'd be great, thanks.</i>

30:47.263 --> 30:48.890
Here, we're gonna push this
over here, help me.

30:48.932 --> 30:50.684
Right now, like,
push this over there?

30:50.725 --> 30:51.851
Like, closer to the...

30:51.893 --> 30:54.229
-Ooh!
-Oh!

30:54.270 --> 30:56.147
Get a towel! Towel!

30:56.189 --> 30:58.483
Fraser?
Fraser?

30:58.525 --> 31:00.068
Captain, foredeck.

31:00.110 --> 31:01.319
There's no traffic ahead,
you're free to swing.

31:04.739 --> 31:07.283
Hey, we're under control.

31:07.325 --> 31:09.661
Oh, Fraser!

31:10.829 --> 31:11.955
Oh, I'm so sorry.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.873
We spilled, like,
the whole plant.

31:13.915 --> 31:14.916
Is there a way that
we can get paper towels?

31:14.958 --> 31:16.042
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:16.084 --> 31:17.752
Peng!
Don't tell on us!

31:17.794 --> 31:19.379
It was Quai who did it.

31:19.421 --> 31:20.797
These things happen.

31:20.839 --> 31:23.216
Is it too soon to
throw oneself overboard?

31:24.467 --> 31:26.136
We were just
gonna move it like that.

31:26.177 --> 31:28.138
Yeah, all good.

31:30.306 --> 31:31.766
Good job, guys.

31:31.808 --> 31:33.018
Looking good, Cap.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.310
Good.

31:35.478 --> 31:36.813
Almost 40 years.

31:42.193 --> 31:44.195
Every sh-- job there was,
I did it.

31:44.237 --> 31:45.196
Mm.

31:45.238 --> 31:46.448
Tony's green.

31:46.489 --> 31:48.950
Skill sets can be taught,
but Jesus Christ,

31:48.992 --> 31:50.785
look at this ----ing
kid's attitude.

31:50.827 --> 31:52.412
Got a smile as
big as all outdoors,

31:52.454 --> 31:54.080
and the willingness
to learn is there.

31:54.122 --> 31:57.459
I'm going, like,
I can work with that.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.336
-Bilge rat.
-Yeah?

32:02.797 --> 32:04.424
<i>Deck crew, let's go</i>
<i>and change up.</i>

32:04.466 --> 32:05.884
All right, Boss, I'm gonna go.

32:05.925 --> 32:09.012
-Thank you for the chat.
-You're welcome, sir.

32:11.014 --> 32:14.893
Burn-face person,
that's what I seem to be.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.519
Nice job on the bow.

32:16.561 --> 32:17.812
-You think?
-Yeah.

32:17.854 --> 32:19.272
-Yeah?
-You've got really good...

32:19.314 --> 32:20.648
like, I didn't realize
you knew so much.

32:20.690 --> 32:23.485
Yeah.

32:23.526 --> 32:26.404
Yeah, that'd be really nice,
if you and I were on the bow.

32:27.822 --> 32:30.158
I'm a hopeless romantic.

32:30.200 --> 32:30.992
Oh, you ready?

32:31.034 --> 32:33.161
How does it go?
Like this.

32:33.203 --> 32:36.831
Yeah, the eyes and the smile,
she got me good.

32:36.873 --> 32:38.249
What does he say?

32:38.291 --> 32:40.335
It's something like
"Open your eyes, Rose."

32:40.377 --> 32:41.670
Rose?

32:41.711 --> 32:43.380
She was saying that
she wanted to be on the bow

32:43.421 --> 32:44.673
with me next time, I said we can
get a real "Titanic" vibe going.

32:44.714 --> 32:45.799
Yeah.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.841
Where do you want us?

32:46.883 --> 32:47.884
Eating lunch.

32:47.926 --> 32:49.219
Nice, there's food.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.303
Hey.

32:53.598 --> 32:56.017
Salad, and then
roasted red peppers,

32:56.059 --> 32:58.728
walnuts, hummus, baba ganoush.

32:58.770 --> 32:59.771
-Okay.
-All right, cool, thank you.

32:59.813 --> 33:02.273
Cool, thank you all.

33:02.315 --> 33:04.776
That was clean, came off
the dock no problems.

33:08.405 --> 33:10.365
<i>Ross, let's get ready</i>
<i>to drop the anchor.</i>

33:10.407 --> 33:11.866
You called it.

33:11.908 --> 33:13.159
Copy, on my way.

33:14.577 --> 33:16.746
What the actual [bleep]?

33:16.788 --> 33:18.456
It feels so good out here.

33:18.498 --> 33:20.417
Does the boat make you feel
more drunk 'cause it wiggles?

33:20.458 --> 33:22.877
Probably, but you need
to just get more drunk.

33:22.919 --> 33:24.713
In position, ready to drop.

33:24.754 --> 33:26.297
And drop.

33:30.802 --> 33:32.554
Go ahead and lock it in, Ross.

33:32.595 --> 33:34.222
We cheated death again.

33:43.314 --> 33:44.774
[shrieking]

33:48.987 --> 33:50.572
Aren't we supposed to be
having lunch right now?

33:50.613 --> 33:52.449
Because we were just sitting
there for a while, and I...

33:52.490 --> 33:55.452
I will be sure to let you know.

33:55.493 --> 33:56.828
I'll ask.

33:58.872 --> 33:59.831
It's ----ing frozen.

33:59.873 --> 34:01.249
-Frozen?
-Yeah.

34:01.291 --> 34:03.335
I don't give a sh--.
It really is what it is.

34:03.376 --> 34:04.753
There's nothing
we can do about it.

34:04.794 --> 34:06.254
So, lunch is late.

34:06.296 --> 34:08.381
We've got so many factors
that are in play here...

34:08.423 --> 34:14.137
new crew, new equipment,
and a very vast boat.

34:15.972 --> 34:17.849
Suck my ----ing sphincter.

34:17.891 --> 34:20.560
And now I feel like
a rushed asshole.

34:20.602 --> 34:21.603
That ----ing sucks.

34:21.644 --> 34:22.771
We haven't had lunch yet.

34:22.812 --> 34:23.772
We were supposed to eat
at 3:00, though.

34:31.279 --> 34:31.821
Do you want a drink?

34:32.739 --> 34:34.032
No, I don't, actually.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.408
I wanna eat.

34:39.579 --> 34:42.082
Motor [bleep] me bitch, and
not you, I meant life.

34:42.874 --> 34:44.209
Let's get that pump.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.877
Uh-huh.

34:45.919 --> 34:48.046
If you're not topless dancing
by the end of this trip,

34:48.088 --> 34:49.047
I'm not here for it.

34:49.089 --> 34:50.715
-Oh, my God!
-Yes!

34:50.757 --> 34:52.550
Nothing's working out today.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.719
When are we eating,
is that soon?

34:54.761 --> 34:56.262
Very, very, very soon.

34:56.304 --> 34:57.722
-Ready to go?
-Yeah.

34:57.764 --> 34:59.140
Okay, I'm gonna invite them
to be seated,

34:59.182 --> 35:00.225
come down, and take stuff up.

35:00.266 --> 35:01.559
Yes, that's perfect, thank you.

35:01.601 --> 35:03.269
-Ready?
-Yeah.

35:03.311 --> 35:04.354
Day one.

35:04.396 --> 35:05.313
Can I invite you
to be seated for lunch?

35:05.355 --> 35:06.564
-Ready to go?
-Yeah.

35:06.606 --> 35:08.108
Thank you.

35:10.485 --> 35:11.945
So, you're at the head
of the table...

35:11.986 --> 35:13.405
-Wait, is there dinner?
-No, lunch, honey.

35:13.446 --> 35:14.406
It's lunch.

35:14.447 --> 35:15.865
Oh.

35:15.907 --> 35:17.534
Alissa, we're gonna start
taking food up together now.

35:17.575 --> 35:18.910
Oh, okay.

35:18.952 --> 35:20.120
We're gonna dot it
around the table.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.705
If you can go to
one part of the table,

35:21.746 --> 35:23.206
and I can go to the other.

35:25.625 --> 35:26.710
Oh.

35:26.751 --> 35:27.836
We need the pita.

35:27.877 --> 35:28.920
Hey, guys.

35:28.962 --> 35:31.256
Yay!

35:31.297 --> 35:33.883
So, this is baba ganoush.

35:33.925 --> 35:36.261
Feta, hummus, and some olives.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.013
You guys, I don't even
know what I'm eating.

35:38.054 --> 35:39.055
There's, like, beans in this.

35:39.097 --> 35:40.640
It's hummus.

35:40.682 --> 35:41.933
Ooh, that's good.

35:41.975 --> 35:43.643
I'm getting hangry.

35:43.685 --> 35:45.562
We need more than bread.

35:45.603 --> 35:47.188
Why have I got a pillow?

35:47.230 --> 35:50.650
First lunch service,
I'm feeling a little bit...

35:50.692 --> 35:52.736
Okay...
...frazzled.

35:52.777 --> 35:53.820
-Right there.
-Oh!

35:53.862 --> 35:55.363
Oh, my God, Peng.

35:55.405 --> 35:57.574
What is happening,
I don't even get it right now.

35:57.615 --> 35:59.117
Oh, was that from me?

35:59.159 --> 36:01.453
I'll attend to it right away,
no worries.

36:01.494 --> 36:03.288
What can I do, apart from
just roll with the punches?

36:03.329 --> 36:07.500
I'm not God, as much
as I look like him.

36:10.587 --> 36:13.048
Maybe we should stop
drinking for a minute.

36:14.716 --> 36:16.384
I have the meat, guys.

36:16.426 --> 36:19.763
So, we have chicken over here,
and then we've got lamb as well.

36:19.804 --> 36:21.431
Sh--, I'm already full.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.141
Where did this even come from?

36:23.183 --> 36:28.355
I'm sweating like an
absolute filthy, reckless...

36:31.191 --> 36:32.525
That was so good.

36:32.567 --> 36:34.986
It was so good,
that was amazing.

36:35.028 --> 36:37.030
Okay, we'll come out and clear.

36:39.366 --> 36:40.658
Cool, let's start with platters.

36:41.659 --> 36:42.869
Let's go swim!

36:42.911 --> 36:44.829
And so tonight, I've got
three dancers coming on.

36:44.871 --> 36:46.790
I'm gonna send for them
to come in a water taxi.

36:46.831 --> 36:51.002
At 5:30 we've got
the birthday cake pickup.

36:51.044 --> 36:52.420
Five-thirty and
pick up a giant cake,

36:52.462 --> 36:53.963
might have someone in it,
might not.

36:54.005 --> 36:56.049
I don't think it will then,
but it will eventually.

36:56.091 --> 36:58.218
Cool.

36:58.259 --> 36:59.761
Okay, let's try that,
how does it look?

36:59.803 --> 37:02.514
You look amazing.

37:02.555 --> 37:03.890
-Thank you very much.
-Yep.

37:03.932 --> 37:05.183
Oh sh--, it's wet.

37:05.225 --> 37:07.143
-Why is it wet?
-We're on an ocean.

37:07.185 --> 37:08.436
Oh!

37:11.356 --> 37:13.733
Look how pretty this is.

37:13.775 --> 37:15.276
Nine o'clock's fine for dinner?

37:15.318 --> 37:17.737
It's tasting menus,
truffle, Italian,

37:17.779 --> 37:19.155
every ----ing thing.

37:19.197 --> 37:20.532
You can get that done in an hour
and a half.

37:20.573 --> 37:22.033
-Oh, yeah.
-They're gonna be absolute...

37:22.075 --> 37:23.785
-----ing wasted?
-Knee-deep wasted by then.

37:23.827 --> 37:24.869
Love it.

37:24.911 --> 37:26.246
I'm excited for the rage party.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.081
I hope my break is on
that dumbass party.

37:28.123 --> 37:30.500
I'm excited about the rage,
I'm excited.

37:30.542 --> 37:31.543
For somebody else's rage?

37:31.584 --> 37:33.211
They want us to be a part of it.

37:33.253 --> 37:36.006
-I know, but I'm...
-We can't drink, but...

37:36.047 --> 37:37.590
I won't be raging, then.

37:39.384 --> 37:40.719
If I were second stew,

37:40.760 --> 37:43.138
I'd have fun with it,
a little more fun.

37:43.179 --> 37:45.098
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

37:45.140 --> 37:48.309
Alissa, she's like that kid
in class who got all A's,

37:48.351 --> 37:50.478
and I was that kid in class
who was like,

37:50.520 --> 37:52.564
if I just get a C, man, like,

37:52.605 --> 37:55.734
we just gon' roll out with
that degree, pack it up.

37:55.775 --> 37:58.111
-Camille, Camille, Fraser.
-Go ahead.

37:58.153 --> 37:59.946
Can you meet me in
the crew mess, please?

37:59.988 --> 38:02.240
<i>Yeah, I've gotta run some</i>
<i>drinks and I'll be right down.</i>

38:02.282 --> 38:04.492
-You can go.
-I am.

38:04.534 --> 38:06.244
Oh, no, I was talking to Fraser.

38:06.286 --> 38:07.912
-Oh, go to Fraser?
-Yeah.

38:07.954 --> 38:09.748
Okay, cool.

38:09.789 --> 38:12.751
Oh, my God,
that cake is awesome.

38:12.792 --> 38:15.587
-Hello.
-Okay, got it?

38:15.628 --> 38:16.838
Gorge.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.089
They're gonna love those,
aren't they?

38:18.131 --> 38:19.299
No, these are great.

38:19.341 --> 38:20.508
-Oh!
-Oh!

38:20.550 --> 38:23.136
-I made it.
-Ooh.

38:23.178 --> 38:24.971
-Can you come down now, please?
-Yeah.

38:25.013 --> 38:25.972
We're also gonna dress the crew.

38:26.014 --> 38:27.265
I'm excited.

38:27.307 --> 38:28.850
Yeah, these are fun,
aren't they?

38:28.892 --> 38:30.018
Almost looks better, doesn't it?

38:30.060 --> 38:31.436
And this way, it's a surprise.

38:31.478 --> 38:33.438
Yeah, it really is.

38:36.066 --> 38:37.442
Yeah.

38:37.484 --> 38:39.611
Okay, I'm so small,
like, even sitting

38:39.652 --> 38:41.863
on this top thing
I see right here.

38:45.158 --> 38:46.368
Shut up!

38:46.409 --> 38:48.036
You guys, I lost my sunglasses.

38:48.078 --> 38:50.121
They're on your face.

38:50.163 --> 38:52.749
They're drunker than a bunch of
four-peckered goats, ain't they?

38:52.791 --> 38:53.958
Got it.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.043
-Okay.
-Okay.

38:55.085 --> 38:56.294
This thing is so slippery.

38:56.336 --> 38:57.879
Grab the middle part.

38:57.921 --> 39:00.799
Where my hands are, you see?

39:00.840 --> 39:01.841
Yeah!

39:03.635 --> 39:05.345
Darling, go down and get into
your blacks for me, please?

39:05.387 --> 39:07.347
-Dress?
-Yes, please.

39:12.018 --> 39:15.980
Nice to be on the hook instead
of running around in the dark.

39:16.022 --> 39:18.483
-You've never been to Utah?
-I've not, no.

39:18.525 --> 39:19.651
I'll tell you this,
it will surprise you.

39:19.693 --> 39:22.862
I mean, I just adore gay...

39:22.904 --> 39:24.406
-Anything.
-Anything.

39:24.447 --> 39:26.157
Do you know about Mormons?

39:26.199 --> 39:27.450
Well, I've heard.

39:27.492 --> 39:28.660
Did you know
we were all Mormon?

39:28.702 --> 39:30.286
-Was there a...
-Like, all of us here.

39:30.328 --> 39:31.287
-We're all Mormon.
-We were all Mormons.

39:31.329 --> 39:32.497
We were all Mormon.

39:32.539 --> 39:34.082
-What does that mean?
-Multiple wives.

39:34.124 --> 39:35.500
See, I just...

39:35.542 --> 39:36.501
No, not multiple wives,
that's not Mormon.

39:36.543 --> 39:38.003
No, that's not Mormon.

39:38.044 --> 39:40.463
Okay.

39:40.505 --> 39:44.718
Point three,
point four on the swing...

39:44.759 --> 39:46.219
humping.

39:46.261 --> 39:48.179
I have been a captain 37 years,

39:48.221 --> 39:52.225
I've been knocking around
the Caribbean for a long time.

39:52.267 --> 39:54.227
St. Lucia's just one of
my favorite islands.

39:54.269 --> 39:56.938
I just love coming here,
it's breathtaking.

39:56.980 --> 40:00.066
But you've got the trade winds
down here, and it's gonna blow.

40:00.108 --> 40:02.610
Just like, waa, waa.

40:02.652 --> 40:04.863
It's gonna make your
life miserable.

40:04.904 --> 40:06.448
Suck it up, creampuff.

40:06.489 --> 40:08.158
Ain't nothing but wind.

40:08.199 --> 40:10.368
It's going to be
very tiny tonight.

40:10.410 --> 40:11.870
Okay, so small bowls.

40:11.911 --> 40:13.496
Yeah, I don't even think
they're that hungry.

40:13.538 --> 40:15.331
No, well, they're drunk as well.

40:15.373 --> 40:17.375
Love you, thank you.

40:17.417 --> 40:19.502
Interior, would one
of you be able

40:19.544 --> 40:22.047
to bring eight wine glasses
from behind the bar?

40:22.088 --> 40:24.257
<i>Copy that, Fraser.</i>

40:25.967 --> 40:27.177
Hello, my love.

40:27.218 --> 40:29.387
Hello, gorgeous girl.

40:29.429 --> 40:33.767
It's pretty classic,
pretty chic.

40:37.687 --> 40:39.356
[glass shatters]

40:39.397 --> 40:41.191
How many have we lost?

40:41.232 --> 40:43.109
-One.
-Yeah.

40:43.151 --> 40:44.944
Is it the boat or is it me?

40:44.986 --> 40:47.072
-No, the boat's rocking.
-No, the boat is bad.

40:47.113 --> 40:48.865
Help me.

40:48.907 --> 40:52.285
Hey, Rache, we just had a lot
of things go over in the galley.

40:53.495 --> 40:56.039
Tony, can you get us
some kind of broom?

40:57.916 --> 40:59.167
What happened?

40:59.209 --> 41:01.002
The boat rocked and
everything went sideways.

41:02.295 --> 41:03.755
We got a problem.

41:03.797 --> 41:05.298
I have to stop
what I'm doing

41:05.340 --> 41:07.884
and I have to go over and
clean everything thoroughly.

41:07.926 --> 41:10.970
If somebody, like, chews on
glass, I mean, that's my ass.

41:11.012 --> 41:12.222
But it takes time.

41:12.263 --> 41:14.307
This is, like, such a nightmare.

41:19.437 --> 41:20.522
Coming up...

41:20.563 --> 41:21.773
The crew area needs a vacuum.

41:21.815 --> 41:24.526
The crew needs
a vacuum right now.

41:24.567 --> 41:26.486
Literally have to
stop what I'm doing

41:34.786 --> 41:35.203
What happened?

41:36.621 --> 41:38.707
The boat rocked and
everything went sideways.

41:40.041 --> 41:42.752
This dinner service
is not going how I planned.

41:42.794 --> 41:46.548
I've got glass everywhere, and
now I'm in such a time crunch.

41:48.591 --> 41:50.427
The only thing I'm worried
about is me spiraling

41:50.468 --> 41:52.971
and ----ing shove my
foot up someone's ass.

41:53.013 --> 41:54.139
Thank you, guys.

42:01.771 --> 42:03.356
Here we go!

42:03.398 --> 42:04.858
Oh, is that for me?

42:04.899 --> 42:05.692
That's for you.

42:05.734 --> 42:07.360
<i>Rachel, Rachel, Fraser.</i>

42:07.402 --> 42:08.445
<i>Have you got an ETA?</i>

42:08.486 --> 42:10.405
Can I escort them to the table?

42:12.032 --> 42:13.700
I just wanna welcome you guys
to dinner

42:13.742 --> 42:16.661
upstairs in the sky lounge.
Yes.

42:16.703 --> 42:18.747
I've had a wedgie for
about two hours.

42:18.788 --> 42:20.248
This looks way too pretty!

42:20.290 --> 42:24.210
Y'all, we look like
Mississippi porch whores.

42:24.252 --> 42:25.754
[laughing]

42:25.795 --> 42:27.797
-Towel's a bit wet.
-Yeah, they're wet.

42:27.839 --> 42:29.215
[giggles]

42:29.257 --> 42:31.009
-Breads?
-Yeah, breads can go.

42:31.051 --> 42:34.012
-Can I get some butter?
-I've not got butter ready.

42:35.472 --> 42:37.015
Okay.

42:37.057 --> 42:38.558
Offer them everything,
they've got drinks coming.

42:38.600 --> 42:39.934
I'm gonna get
a chardonnay as well.

42:42.437 --> 42:44.064
[gasps]
We have it!

42:44.105 --> 42:47.400
[bleep] it, I've just got a
little bread for right now,

42:47.442 --> 42:49.611
we've got all our
starters working.

42:49.652 --> 42:52.489
I don't eat bread,
so, like, whatever.

42:53.615 --> 42:55.492
It doesn't?
I feel like it does.

42:55.533 --> 42:58.912
Squeeze it in!

42:58.953 --> 43:01.623
These guests are getting
extremely ----ed up.

43:01.664 --> 43:03.958
Can you pass the oil?

43:04.000 --> 43:05.085
Girl!

43:05.126 --> 43:08.630
That's, like, my vibe.
I love drinking.

43:09.714 --> 43:11.549
If you wanna help
Hayley out, yeah.

43:11.591 --> 43:13.009
So, what time was dinner at?

43:13.051 --> 43:14.594
It's 10:00.

43:14.636 --> 43:15.679
Why are we sitting here?

43:15.720 --> 43:17.347
We just want the food.

43:17.389 --> 43:19.808
<i>Fraser, Fraser, the first</i>
<i>course that will be coming out</i>

43:19.849 --> 43:22.644
will be the cauliflower puree.

43:22.686 --> 43:24.938
They've requested a
multi-course tasting dinner.

43:24.979 --> 43:28.650
There's a lot that goes into it,
and everything's downstairs.

43:29.567 --> 43:31.111
It's a lot of running around,

43:31.152 --> 43:35.782
and every single second
counts when you're in service.

43:37.742 --> 43:40.078
It's like zero to 100, okay?

43:40.120 --> 43:42.414
Don't be a [bleep].

43:42.455 --> 43:44.749
-Not you.
<i>-Deck crew, Fraser.</i>

43:44.791 --> 43:48.420
Is anyone on deck
available to help me serve?

43:48.461 --> 43:49.629
<i>We're a bit behind.</i>

43:49.671 --> 43:50.964
I can help, if you need it.

43:51.006 --> 43:52.215
Hey, love.

43:54.426 --> 43:55.802
Brilliant.

43:55.844 --> 43:58.638
I feel like Peng is, like,
so, like, welcoming.

43:58.680 --> 44:01.474
He was, like, my first,
like, friend in Salt Lake,

44:01.516 --> 44:04.519
and he just, like...
like, loved you.

44:04.561 --> 44:05.645
-Oh!
-And I love you.

44:05.687 --> 44:07.522
That was actually so cute.

44:07.564 --> 44:08.940
Oh, Fraser, you want
both of us?

44:08.982 --> 44:10.650
If you're free.

44:10.692 --> 44:11.651
-Take your napkin?
-Yes, thank you.

44:11.693 --> 44:12.652
Yeah, that came out perfect.

44:12.694 --> 44:14.112
But what is that?

44:14.154 --> 44:16.614
Hi, I'm letting you
know what you're eating.

44:18.533 --> 44:19.743
It's mushrooms.

44:19.784 --> 44:22.120
Actually, it is
roasted cauliflowers...

44:22.162 --> 44:23.413
plural, different types.

44:23.455 --> 44:24.622
It's totally mushrooms.

44:24.664 --> 44:26.291
There's no mushrooms in it.

44:26.332 --> 44:27.709
What?

44:27.751 --> 44:29.836
So good, I just ate it all.

44:29.878 --> 44:34.966
With a little bit of an
herbaceous morel broth.

44:35.008 --> 44:36.593
-It's delicious.
-Thank you.

44:36.634 --> 44:38.094
-Thank you!
-It's so good.

44:38.136 --> 44:40.347
It's totally mushrooms,
but that's all right.

44:40.388 --> 44:42.349
So, what's dinner service like?

44:42.390 --> 44:43.808
I felt like a sh---show.

44:43.850 --> 44:46.186
Do we think we'll
get more food, or no?

44:46.227 --> 44:47.729
Was that it?

44:47.771 --> 44:50.857
It's supposed to be five-star
and it feels like...

44:50.899 --> 44:52.525
-Yeah.
-three to me.

44:52.567 --> 44:56.237
It just was like, there's no
butter prepared, no wine pulled.

44:56.279 --> 44:58.573
She needs to just
stop with the whining.

44:58.615 --> 45:00.408
Do you feel like
it was rushed, or?

45:00.450 --> 45:02.619
Discombobbled.

45:02.660 --> 45:06.164
Just smile,
suck it up and carry on.

45:18.176 --> 45:19.761
Good evening.

45:19.803 --> 45:22.389
I have some
beautiful shots, guys.

45:22.430 --> 45:23.723
Oh!

45:23.765 --> 45:25.725
-And you had the Fireball?
-Fireball, yeah.

45:25.767 --> 45:27.477
-Cool.
-Oh, God.

45:27.519 --> 45:29.771
-Thank you guys.
-Of course.

45:29.813 --> 45:31.272
Follow me, guys, please.

45:31.314 --> 45:34.609
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

45:34.651 --> 45:36.945
-Woo!
-No, right, it's extra fiery.

45:36.986 --> 45:38.613
It's like sucking on
the devil's dick.

45:38.655 --> 45:41.032
-Ugh!
-Ugh!

45:41.074 --> 45:42.158
Eew!

45:42.200 --> 45:46.788
Oh, my God, Peng,
don't throw up!

45:46.830 --> 45:47.789
He will.
No, he will.

45:47.831 --> 45:49.165
No, yeah, I think... yeah.

45:49.207 --> 45:50.375
So, for how long have you been
doing this?

45:50.417 --> 45:51.918
-Doing this...
-Yes.

45:51.960 --> 45:54.671
-About 15 years.
-For real?

45:54.713 --> 45:55.755
Oh, that's pretty cool.

45:55.797 --> 45:57.632
For years, yeah.

46:10.437 --> 46:12.105
If you want to borrow
any of our outfits...

46:12.147 --> 46:14.566
Yes, you're more than welcome.

46:14.607 --> 46:16.276
Oh, I'm so bored.

46:16.317 --> 46:17.277
Will it take forever?

46:17.318 --> 46:18.361
Are you drunk yet?

46:18.403 --> 46:19.487
-Yeah.
-Good.

46:19.529 --> 46:20.613
Yeah, they're really impatient.

46:20.655 --> 46:22.449
I'm going.

46:22.490 --> 46:24.784
They're bored sh--less and
it's Peng's birthday tonight.

46:24.826 --> 46:27.245
We still have a party
to give them after.

46:27.287 --> 46:28.955
So, like, it's
stressing me out a lot.

46:28.997 --> 46:32.125
Rache?
Where are you at?

46:32.167 --> 46:34.002
They're just ----ing bored
and they're drunk.

46:36.338 --> 46:37.672
We're being antsy.

46:37.714 --> 46:39.215
This has been a minute.

46:39.257 --> 46:41.092
-Wait, there's vodka.
-No, look, there's food.

46:41.134 --> 46:43.053
-Thank you.
-Ugh!

46:43.094 --> 46:47.140
So cute, I feel like a rabbit.

46:47.182 --> 46:49.142
So, this is a shaved
Brussels sprout salad...

46:49.184 --> 46:52.228
-Oh!
-With truffle oil on top.

46:52.270 --> 46:53.313
Ooh, I love truffle.

46:53.355 --> 46:55.106
You're gonna try
a wig on, come on.

46:55.148 --> 46:56.441
We're gonna try a wig, bro!

46:56.483 --> 46:58.735
The things that we do
in this boat, eh?

46:58.777 --> 47:00.028
I think it works.

47:00.070 --> 47:02.322
I think the outfit
is complete, right?

47:02.364 --> 47:04.032
You guys look amazing.

47:04.074 --> 47:06.117
I am dying.
I am dying right now.

47:06.159 --> 47:08.328
-Hi.
-Hi, baby gorgeous.

47:08.370 --> 47:09.537
Hi, baby gorgeous.

47:09.579 --> 47:11.915
-What's going on?
-Not much.

47:11.956 --> 47:16.419
Yeah, I know.

47:16.461 --> 47:17.837
Your next course is on its way.

47:17.879 --> 47:19.172
I'm plating now.

47:19.214 --> 47:22.008
I don't know,
I'm not hungry anymore.

47:22.050 --> 47:25.887
Ben, you know I'm pretty chill,
but I'm ----ing bored.

47:25.929 --> 47:27.097
I'm changing.

47:27.138 --> 47:28.848
Okay.

47:28.890 --> 47:30.141
Rachel, let's just do dessert.

47:30.183 --> 47:31.309
Yeah, I don't know
where they went.

47:31.351 --> 47:32.519
Most of them have
left the table.

47:32.560 --> 47:33.687
What happened?

47:33.728 --> 47:34.979
They're like, "We're bored,

47:35.021 --> 47:35.980
we're getting ready
for the rave."

47:40.610 --> 47:41.903
Ben, you know I'm pretty chill,
but I'm ----ing bored.

47:43.488 --> 47:44.447
I'm changing.

47:44.489 --> 47:45.573
-Okay.
-Oh, yeah!

47:45.615 --> 47:46.825
Rachel, let's just do dessert.

47:46.866 --> 47:48.243
Yeah, I don't know
where they went.

47:48.284 --> 47:49.744
Most of them have
left the table.

47:49.786 --> 47:50.829
Dump it, get rid of it,
I don't care.

47:50.870 --> 47:51.955
Suck my dick.

47:51.996 --> 47:53.206
I'm ----ing eating it.

47:53.248 --> 47:54.082
Yeah.

47:54.124 --> 47:55.250
I'll see you guys for the party.

47:55.291 --> 47:56.376
Yeah.

47:56.418 --> 47:57.544
I feel really bad.

47:57.585 --> 48:00.213
Mm.

48:00.255 --> 48:02.590
If one of you would like
to go on this side,

48:02.632 --> 48:04.050
and you can join here.

48:08.471 --> 48:11.516
My ass is gonna be able to
jiggle in this type of material.

48:11.558 --> 48:13.268
How does this thing go?

48:13.309 --> 48:14.436
Hi!

48:14.477 --> 48:15.937
It was so good,
everything was so good.

48:15.979 --> 48:17.689
-Oh, my gosh, amazing.
-Thank you...

48:17.731 --> 48:19.274
These are edible, by the way.

48:19.315 --> 48:21.026
-The whole thing?
-The whole thing.

48:21.067 --> 48:23.278
It's like a white
chocolate that's done with

48:23.319 --> 48:25.530
a glaze and a mold, and
then inside of it is lemon curd,

48:25.572 --> 48:28.950
along with blueberries
and whipped cream.

48:28.992 --> 48:30.160
All right, let's go, girls.

48:30.201 --> 48:33.204
This has been
a day one from hell.

48:33.246 --> 48:35.123
-We'll get faster.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, no doubt.

48:35.165 --> 48:37.167
Today's been a
sh-------ing-show.

48:37.208 --> 48:39.461
These guests are
definitely ready to party,

48:39.502 --> 48:41.755
and I'm gonna
hopefully turn this around.

48:41.796 --> 48:43.298
Oh, I feel alive.

48:43.340 --> 48:46.217
Camille, do you want her in
bed by a certain time?

48:46.259 --> 48:48.511
Will you assign her a job
before she goes down?

48:48.553 --> 48:50.305
Oh, my God, I love that!

48:50.347 --> 48:52.849
And then they wanna see his face
on everyone, if that's cool.

48:52.891 --> 48:54.726
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

48:54.768 --> 48:56.978
Yes, all right, you ready, dude?

48:57.020 --> 48:58.646
Well, well, well, look at you.

48:58.688 --> 49:00.398
All right, man in box.

49:00.440 --> 49:02.442
Y'all... oh!

49:02.484 --> 49:07.322
-Woo!
-Yes!

49:07.364 --> 49:10.033
Woo!

49:12.202 --> 49:14.371
[cheering]

49:14.412 --> 49:18.416
Yas, queen, twerk,
twerk, and twerk!

49:18.458 --> 49:19.709
Yes, yes, yes!

49:19.751 --> 49:22.504
Whoa!

49:22.545 --> 49:26.257
We're gonna set the ----ing
thing on fire.

49:27.592 --> 49:32.806
* Happy birthday to you *

49:32.847 --> 49:34.265
Oh, my God, thank you.

49:34.307 --> 49:35.558
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

49:35.600 --> 49:39.187
Woo!

49:39.229 --> 49:40.897
I'm gonna keep you up this
evening...

49:40.939 --> 49:42.482
-Okay.
-Because I'm gonna be on early.

49:42.524 --> 49:43.608
Bye, guys!

49:43.650 --> 49:44.984
Thank you, bye-bye.

49:45.026 --> 49:47.654
Well, that was that.

49:47.696 --> 49:50.532
You can go down.

49:50.573 --> 49:51.866
I'm tired.

49:51.908 --> 49:52.867
Night, guys, see you
in the morning.

49:52.909 --> 49:54.035
See you, mate.

49:54.077 --> 49:55.370
Oh, my God, how is
it only day one?

49:55.412 --> 49:57.247
-Kill me now.
-We're going to bed.

49:57.288 --> 49:59.916
We will see
y'all tomorrow morning.

49:59.958 --> 50:01.376
Good night.

50:01.418 --> 50:03.086
I'm broken.

50:09.009 --> 50:13.304
I am feeling so
unbelievably overwhelmed,

50:13.346 --> 50:16.558
I feel like I've bitten off
far more than I can chew,

50:16.599 --> 50:21.646
and I do not feel prepared
or capable of doing this job.

50:21.688 --> 50:23.148
Ugh.

50:27.193 --> 50:28.611
Do you wanna finish up there,

50:28.653 --> 50:30.905
and then the bar needs
to be restocked.

50:30.947 --> 50:33.033
I've seen them drink Pellegrino,

50:33.074 --> 50:34.659
and lots of flat
water, actually.

50:34.701 --> 50:35.660
They like to drink some water.

50:35.702 --> 50:37.162
They do.

50:39.372 --> 50:42.167
This is, like,
the stupidest sh--.

50:42.208 --> 50:44.002
I think I've been up
for 24 hours.

50:45.795 --> 50:48.256
I am so ----ing tired.

50:48.298 --> 50:50.300
-How are you holding up?
-Water's stocked.

50:50.342 --> 50:51.676
All the fridges are like that?

50:51.718 --> 50:53.678
Yeah, the look pretty
good with everything

50:53.720 --> 50:54.929
that everyone's drinking.

50:54.971 --> 50:56.389
Cool.

50:56.431 --> 50:59.309
If anything, you know,
there's always tomorrow.

50:59.351 --> 51:02.354
We'll walk through
and we'll get you to bed.

51:02.395 --> 51:03.229
Oh.

51:03.271 --> 51:05.899
The crew area needs a vacuum.

51:05.940 --> 51:09.444
The crew needs
a vacuum right now?

51:09.486 --> 51:11.863
If you don't want to, know
that I'm gonna do it, so.

51:11.905 --> 51:15.116
I'm gonna go check the
fridges while you vacuum.

51:17.452 --> 51:19.454
Literally have
to stop what I'm doing

51:19.496 --> 51:21.456
to chase her around the boat.

51:21.498 --> 51:24.292
And it's, like,
1,800 flights of stairs.

51:24.334 --> 51:27.128
There's no flat water in
the glow fridge.

51:27.170 --> 51:31.424
This water, right here,
it's in the glow fridge.

51:31.466 --> 51:34.177
Babe, I just went down to
the fridge, it's not stocked.

51:34.219 --> 51:35.428
Okay, let's go down
to the fridge.

51:35.470 --> 51:36.721
And let's bring some water
with us.

51:36.763 --> 51:39.224
And, like, as much
as you hate to hear it,

51:39.265 --> 51:41.434
I hate to tell you even more.

51:41.476 --> 51:42.811
Like, trust me.

51:42.852 --> 51:45.313
There's a way to lead
and there's bossing.

51:45.355 --> 51:46.773
We're trying to get you to bed,

51:46.815 --> 51:50.360
but we're also trying to
get you to do it right.

51:50.402 --> 51:53.571
Bossing is I'm gonna push
you down, tell you what to do,

51:53.613 --> 51:55.490
and make you do it

51:55.532 --> 51:57.158
because that's what
you're just gonna do.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.452
And that does not
sit well with me at all.

51:59.494 --> 52:01.287
Take a look in this fridge.

52:01.329 --> 52:03.164
There's space for flat,
there's space for Pellegrino,

52:03.206 --> 52:05.000
there's space for
more sodas right here.

52:05.041 --> 52:06.668
This is an empty fridge to me.

52:06.710 --> 52:08.420
Right, but there's
flat water in here.

52:08.461 --> 52:10.171
If she doesn't wanna
be corrected,

52:10.213 --> 52:11.339
just do it correctly.

52:11.381 --> 52:12.924
Ugh.

52:12.966 --> 52:15.135
You could stock it with whatever
you want, as long as it's full.

52:15.176 --> 52:16.553
I'm just trying
to be real with you.

52:16.594 --> 52:18.138
You should just stock
a fridge

52:18.179 --> 52:19.514
so I don't have to tell
you how to do it.

52:19.556 --> 52:20.724
It's easy.

52:20.765 --> 52:22.726
You said put flat water
in here, and I did.

52:22.767 --> 52:24.811
This girl's getting
on my nerves.

52:24.853 --> 52:26.312
This is gonna be a long season.

52:28.231 --> 52:30.025
This season on "Below Deck"...

52:30.066 --> 52:32.569
* Yeah, I'd like to know *

52:32.610 --> 52:38.283
* Where you got the notion *

52:38.324 --> 52:42.287
* To rock the boat *

52:42.328 --> 52:47.417
* Don't rock the boat *

52:47.459 --> 52:50.003
Is dessert gonna
be you, Captain?

52:50.045 --> 52:51.629
I think I'm schvitzing.

52:51.671 --> 52:53.465
Woo!

52:53.506 --> 52:54.549
Whoa.

52:54.591 --> 52:55.884
Maybe yachting's
just not for you.

52:55.925 --> 52:59.054
These guests, they
like to get ----ed up.

52:59.095 --> 53:01.431
I'm definitely on their
wavelength.

53:04.434 --> 53:05.977
Woo!

53:06.019 --> 53:09.564
I do like to frequent intimate
relations with the opposite sex.

53:09.606 --> 53:12.192
A week with no sex
for me is really hard.

53:16.363 --> 53:17.822
You look very Namaste.

53:17.864 --> 53:20.241
-Oh!
-Woo!

53:20.283 --> 53:23.119
Welcome to the circus.

53:23.161 --> 53:26.164
We are going to work
your asses to the bone.

53:26.206 --> 53:27.791
We're gonna lose
this one, quickly!

53:27.832 --> 53:28.833
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

53:28.875 --> 53:30.794
What the [bleep] is he doing?

53:30.835 --> 53:32.796
Keep your head down.

53:32.837 --> 53:34.381
Whoa!

53:34.422 --> 53:35.799
Can you be a bit
more erect, please?

53:35.840 --> 53:38.551
You will lose your job
because you ----ed up.

53:38.593 --> 53:40.762
Why am I doing all the ----ing
dishes on the yacht?

53:40.804 --> 53:44.182
If you're looking for sympathy,
it's in the dictionary between

53:44.224 --> 53:47.060
sh-- and "syphilis."

53:47.102 --> 53:50.271
If my wig flies off,
somebody's jumping in to get it.

53:50.313 --> 53:54.109
My mind's there,
my heart's there.

53:54.150 --> 53:56.069
My body just won't cooperate.

53:56.111 --> 53:57.821
Ah!

53:57.862 --> 53:59.364
So, I've made a decision.

54:02.283 --> 54:07.205
What the [bleep]
is going on up in here?

54:07.247 --> 54:11.918
* Don't rock the boat *
