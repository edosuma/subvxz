WEBVTT

00:34.458 --> 00:35.489
Code red.

00:35.668 --> 00:37.826
Floor supervisor,
report to station immediately.

00:38.004 --> 00:39.795
This is a code red.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.253
Both on other side.

00:42.759 --> 00:44.835
- It has to be secured.
- Let's get this contained.

01:27.576 --> 01:29.534
Come on, Iron Fist,
hit me with your best shot.

01:29.767 --> 01:31.890
Would you be careful, please?
This is a Number 14.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.675
It's the first appearance
of Sabretooth.

01:35.950 --> 01:37.777
Does that make you wanna hit me?

01:37.953 --> 01:40.278
It's really tempting,
but I think I'm gonna pass.

01:40.455 --> 01:42.115
Maybe Ziva will do it.

01:42.291 --> 01:43.702
Maybe Ziva will do what?

01:43.876 --> 01:45.453
I've been working on my six-pack.

01:45.628 --> 01:47.667
You know, abs.

01:47.838 --> 01:49.119
You and Abby have been drinking.

01:49.298 --> 01:51.968
No, abdominals.
No more beer gut for me.

01:52.135 --> 01:54.128
I've been training hardcore
getting the core hard.

01:54.304 --> 01:57.139
- Carved. Hard as wood.
- To match your head.

01:57.307 --> 02:00.147
You know, I think you're afraid
that if you hit me as hard as you could,

02:00.269 --> 02:02.029
I'd think I was being tickled
with a feather.

02:03.647 --> 02:05.521
I will take a swing at your six-pack.

02:06.484 --> 02:08.441
Well, it's more like a four-pack.

02:08.610 --> 02:11.067
And then there's this one
sort of long, stubborn one.

02:11.239 --> 02:13.148
Never mind. Do it.

02:13.325 --> 02:14.570
As hard as she can?

02:14.743 --> 02:16.736
- As hard as you can.
- That's how Houdini died.

02:16.912 --> 02:17.992
Ziva, did you kill Houdini?

02:18.163 --> 02:20.833
It is possible.
I do not remember all their names.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.834
Okay, hold on.

02:26.297 --> 02:28.373
Okay, do it.

02:29.342 --> 02:30.505
Escaped mental patient.

02:30.885 --> 02:32.594
Exactly what I'm thinking, boss.

02:32.762 --> 02:34.091
Bethesda Naval Hospital.

02:34.264 --> 02:35.864
Attacked an orderly,
busted up the place.

02:36.016 --> 02:37.427
Come on, let's go.

02:37.851 --> 02:39.761
Hey, come on.
I don't need the rescue.

02:39.937 --> 02:42.689
Seriously,
give me your best shot, right now.

02:46.402 --> 02:47.517
Oh, yeah.

02:47.946 --> 02:49.773
Not bad.

02:49.948 --> 02:52.190
Not as good as Gibbs, though.

02:57.081 --> 02:58.112
Cramped quarters.

02:58.290 --> 03:00.283
Inpatient wing. It's a secure unit.

03:00.459 --> 03:01.491
Least, it's meant to be.

03:01.669 --> 03:02.867
How long has he been here?

03:03.046 --> 03:05.418
Got shipped home from Iraq
about two weeks ago.

03:05.590 --> 03:08.046
He's been receiving treatment
for post-traumatic stress.

03:08.218 --> 03:10.543
- What happened to him?
- It beats the hell out of me.

03:10.721 --> 03:14.090
Guy didn't talk much.
That's typical of PTSD.

03:14.266 --> 03:17.386
The shrink's been trying to get him
to open up as part of his treatment.

03:17.561 --> 03:18.724
What's the other part?

03:18.896 --> 03:22.562
Meds. Combination
of anti-depressant paroxetine

03:22.734 --> 03:25.403
and, you know,
mild sedatives to help him sleep.

03:25.570 --> 03:27.490
Might wanna consider
something a little stronger.

03:27.614 --> 03:29.274
He did this with his bare hands?

03:30.242 --> 03:32.069
- Yeah.
- Impressive.

03:32.244 --> 03:33.786
Outside.

03:34.747 --> 03:35.945
Are you already done in here?

03:36.123 --> 03:39.078
Yeah, don't need to look
the one place we know he's not.

03:39.252 --> 03:41.079
Corporal Damon Werth,
Force Recon.

03:41.254 --> 03:44.089
Part of the Second Marine
stationed in Ramadi.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.583
Transferred out 15 days ago,
ahead of his unit.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.509
Brief stops at Ramstein Air Base
in Germany, then here.

03:50.681 --> 03:52.840
What happened
after he went out the window?

03:53.017 --> 03:55.590
Well, he jacked a ride
pulling out of the driveway.

03:56.229 --> 03:58.103
Where's the driver?

03:58.773 --> 04:00.766
Well, there was a lot going on. I...

04:00.942 --> 04:02.436
Where's the driver?

04:02.611 --> 04:04.354
I don't know.

04:04.780 --> 04:06.523
Boss, I could pull up
the exterior cameras.

04:06.698 --> 04:08.490
Might be able to see something.

04:08.909 --> 04:13.073
In fact, I could probably be doing that
right now instead of talking about it.

04:18.503 --> 04:20.211
All right, listen up, people.

04:20.380 --> 04:22.788
Our fugitive has been on the run
for 90 minutes.

04:22.966 --> 04:24.959
It has been three hours, Tony.

04:25.719 --> 04:28.471
Average foot speed
over uneven ground,

04:28.639 --> 04:31.130
barring injuries,
is four miles per hour.

04:31.309 --> 04:32.720
He's not on foot, he's in a car.

04:32.894 --> 04:36.014
What I need
from each and every one of you

04:36.189 --> 04:37.683
is a hard-target search

04:38.984 --> 04:42.068
of every gas station, residence,
warehouse, firehouse,

04:42.237 --> 04:44.396
henhouse, outhouse
and doghouse in the area.

04:44.990 --> 04:47.660
Our fugitive has a name, and it is...

04:47.827 --> 04:48.989
Corporal Damon Werth.

04:50.329 --> 04:52.287
Hey, the Tommy Lee Jones speech?

04:52.457 --> 04:54.366
Every time we have a fugitive?
Really?

04:55.001 --> 04:58.086
It's not just a fugitive.
Werth took a hostage.

04:58.255 --> 05:01.007
- Who?
- Dr. Adrian De La Casa.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.455
BOLO out on his car.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.422
De La Casa is one of the attending
psychiatrists on the ward.

05:05.596 --> 05:06.841
Had the graveyard shift.

05:07.014 --> 05:08.214
Involved in Werth's treatment?

05:09.517 --> 05:10.548
Might help his chances.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.601
He knows who he's dealing with.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.099
At least someone does.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.230
What does De La Casa think
of Werth?

05:16.400 --> 05:21.940
Well, "patient exhibits paranoia,
delusional fantasies, hyperactivity,

05:22.114 --> 05:24.522
tendency towards violent outbursts."

05:24.700 --> 05:26.610
What does Werth think
of De La Casa?

05:27.203 --> 05:29.077
Doesn't say.

05:33.418 --> 05:35.707
I think I'm staring
at the man in charge right now.

05:35.879 --> 05:37.124
You are?

05:37.297 --> 05:39.504
I'm gonna find out
what Corporal Werth's status is.

05:39.675 --> 05:40.956
So are we.

05:42.678 --> 05:43.758
Yes, sir.

05:44.430 --> 05:46.423
Apologies. Senator Hawkins.

05:46.599 --> 05:48.806
Ray Vincent.
Senator's Public Affairs.

05:48.977 --> 05:50.008
You're Gibbs?

05:50.562 --> 05:54.430
You need to work fast.
This could be a potential PR disaster.

05:54.608 --> 05:56.316
That's always my primary concern.

05:56.485 --> 05:59.735
You see, the thing is, in three days,

05:59.905 --> 06:04.069
the senator's scheduled
to give Corporal Werth the Silver Star.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.570
Your missing Marine's a hero.

06:15.598 --> 06:17.238
When you're dealing
with a guy on the run,

06:17.391 --> 06:21.092
you've gotta climb inside his head,
think his thoughts.

06:21.271 --> 06:23.394
What would he do?
Where would he go?

06:23.565 --> 06:25.308
Did a one-armed man
murder his wife?

06:25.484 --> 06:27.939
Would he dress up like a clown
and join a travelling circus?

06:28.111 --> 06:30.235
Like Jimmy Stewart
in The Greatest Show on Earth.

06:30.406 --> 06:32.233
Do any of your ideas
come from reality?

06:32.783 --> 06:34.906
Sure. Just not your reality.

06:35.077 --> 06:37.236
Could you try to zero in
on Werth's reality?

06:38.081 --> 06:40.406
Considering that the dude
skipped the loony bin,

06:40.583 --> 06:43.917
maybe a little bit of non-linear
fuzzy logic is the key to tracking him.

06:44.087 --> 06:45.997
Maybe he was accused of a crime
he didn't commit

06:46.173 --> 06:49.874
and is trying to promptly escape
to the Los Angeles underground.

06:50.052 --> 06:51.879
He's not the A-team, McGee.

06:52.054 --> 06:53.086
Might be.

06:53.264 --> 06:55.423
Aside from a medical incident
that delayed his career,

06:55.600 --> 06:57.925
Corporal Werth is your poster boy
for the Marine Corps.

06:58.603 --> 06:59.766
Performance evals?

06:59.938 --> 07:02.773
Rapid improvement in every facet
since he enlisted four years ago.

07:02.941 --> 07:05.942
Strength, speed, stamina,
mental acuity, everything.

07:06.445 --> 07:09.115
Steady promotion up the ranks.
Due to make sergeant.

07:09.281 --> 07:11.607
The only time Werth has been away
from the Marines

07:11.784 --> 07:15.569
was to go to England for a joint
training exercise with the British SAS.

07:15.747 --> 07:17.289
That was his vacation?

07:17.457 --> 07:19.664
- How did he do?
- He aced it.

07:19.835 --> 07:23.204
I have to brief the senator and then
try to run interference with the media.

07:23.380 --> 07:25.622
You'll update me every half hour,
yes?

07:27.718 --> 07:30.719
The clock is ticking on this, people.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.347
Sophie. Yeah, let the senator know
that I just met with NCIS...

07:34.517 --> 07:37.222
The suit fill you in
on what happened in Iraq?

07:37.395 --> 07:39.803
Werth's unit
was ambushed and captured.

07:39.982 --> 07:42.188
He was being tortured
when he broke loose.

07:42.359 --> 07:45.479
He killed his interrogators and carried
all three of his men to safety.

07:46.489 --> 07:50.238
Yeah. Leathernecks nicknamed him
Corporal Punishment.

07:50.410 --> 07:51.785
What else you got?

07:51.953 --> 07:54.076
Werth's life. Locations of interest.

07:54.247 --> 07:56.074
Boot camp at Parris lsland,

07:56.249 --> 07:59.167
stationed at Quantico, then LeJeune
before shipping out overseas.

07:59.586 --> 08:01.413
- Family?
- Unmarried, no siblings.

08:01.589 --> 08:03.083
His father is retired SAS.

08:03.257 --> 08:05.380
Mother is a behavioural therapist.

08:05.551 --> 08:06.666
They live in Michigan.

08:07.011 --> 08:08.921
Senator Hawkins' home state.

08:09.097 --> 08:10.425
Friends in the area?

08:10.598 --> 08:12.958
I don't think he had any friends
outside of the corps, boss.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.726
Dr. De La Casa?

08:14.895 --> 08:16.804
Navy Captain.
Resides in Reston, Virginia.

08:16.980 --> 08:18.356
He works at Bethesda.

08:18.524 --> 08:20.682
So he'd have to take
the Dulles Toll Road every day.

08:20.860 --> 08:23.398
So he would have a Smart Tag.
Magoo?

08:24.655 --> 08:26.613
Scanned on 267 yesterday.

08:26.783 --> 08:29.025
Again this morning,
entering Virginia.

08:29.202 --> 08:30.722
Tried to triangulate
De La Casa's cell,

08:30.871 --> 08:32.033
but it's either switched off

08:32.205 --> 08:35.289
or Werth's laying low
in the countryside, out of range.

08:36.210 --> 08:38.748
Wait.
Smart Tag just entered The District.

08:40.006 --> 08:41.548
Try his cell again.

08:46.721 --> 08:48.880
- Hello?
- Who is this?

08:49.391 --> 08:51.467
Gibbs, NCIS.

08:51.643 --> 08:54.561
I'm looking
for a Dr. Adrian De La Casa.

08:55.564 --> 08:57.224
Well, look harder.

08:57.817 --> 08:58.896
Northwest D.C.

08:59.068 --> 09:01.227
If he leaves his cell on,
I can get an exact location.

09:01.404 --> 09:02.815
Do it on the way.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.020
Just lights.

09:39.237 --> 09:40.862
For what?

09:43.158 --> 09:44.617
Dr. De La Casa?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.279
Yes.

09:47.996 --> 09:50.285
I thought
you were him coming back.

09:50.458 --> 09:51.489
Where'd he go?

09:51.667 --> 09:52.830
I don't know.

09:53.002 --> 09:54.959
He did something with my laptop
and disappeared.

09:55.630 --> 09:56.875
What's with the lights?

09:58.508 --> 10:00.168
Boss?

10:06.850 --> 10:08.309
Now he knows what we look like.

10:11.814 --> 10:14.851
I kept trying to get through to him,
but he didn't seem to recognize me.

10:15.026 --> 10:20.151
Well, it's not unusual for PTSD victims
to exhibit dissociative behaviour.

10:20.615 --> 10:22.739
- You're the medical examiner?
- I am.

10:22.910 --> 10:24.350
But I've also done
an extensive study

10:24.495 --> 10:27.662
of the science
of psychological profiling.

10:27.832 --> 10:30.157
- Well, the patient...
- Corporal Werth.

10:32.003 --> 10:33.545
Werth.

10:34.047 --> 10:36.503
He didn't speak for some time
after he took the wheel.

10:36.675 --> 10:38.751
He seemed confused
by his surroundings.

10:38.927 --> 10:40.635
Well, what gave you
that impression?

10:40.804 --> 10:44.423
He kept mumbling something
about sand or the lack thereof.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.593
Expected to find himself
in the desert.

10:46.978 --> 10:48.472
I believe so.

10:48.646 --> 10:49.927
I tried to talk to him.

10:50.106 --> 10:53.107
He stopped the car and accused me
of manipulating the environment.

10:53.276 --> 10:55.518
Of making him see things
that weren't there.

10:55.695 --> 10:56.894
Why you?

10:57.072 --> 10:59.480
He may have thought
I was a voice in his head.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.787
Obviously,
I tried to convince him otherwise.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.361
He subdued me and bound me.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.915
You didn't resist?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.411
I was afraid for my life.

11:08.877 --> 11:12.246
He picked up on that fear,
made him feel in control.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.293
He could have been riding
an adrenaline high

11:15.467 --> 11:16.878
following his escape.

11:17.052 --> 11:21.549
Then he asked about PFCs
Whitney, Stone and Heatherton.

11:22.016 --> 11:23.179
The other men in his unit.

11:23.351 --> 11:25.791
He wanted to know where they were,
where we were keeping them.

11:26.938 --> 11:28.480
Where are you keeping them?

11:29.190 --> 11:31.314
We're not keeping them.

11:32.903 --> 11:34.730
Oh, hey, boss.

11:35.155 --> 11:38.240
McGee managed to...
Blah, blah, blah, computer geek stuff,

11:38.409 --> 11:42.241
and he figured out that the video feed
was being accessed from a public site

11:42.413 --> 11:43.694
a few blocks from the garage.

11:43.873 --> 11:46.495
- While he watched us?
- Yep, that is exactly true.

11:46.668 --> 11:48.910
The last files accessed
on De La Casa's laptop were...

11:49.087 --> 11:50.879
Patient logs.

11:51.048 --> 11:52.756
Yeah. How did you...?

11:54.051 --> 11:55.249
Three names in particular...

11:55.427 --> 11:57.420
Whitney, Stone and Heatherton.

11:58.097 --> 12:01.182
Well, that's kind of creepy,
that you could...

12:03.686 --> 12:05.763
Whitney and Heatherton
were treated and released

12:05.939 --> 12:07.314
for wounds sustained in combat.

12:07.482 --> 12:09.309
Transferred to LeJeune
for redeployment.

12:09.943 --> 12:11.319
Stone?

12:11.779 --> 12:13.606
His injuries were the most severe.

12:13.781 --> 12:16.354
He's undergoing rehabilitative
physical therapy at Walter Reed.

12:16.534 --> 12:17.945
Werth is on his way there.

12:18.119 --> 12:20.679
Is he gonna break out of one
hospital just to break into another?

12:20.830 --> 12:22.787
I'm gonna go warm up the car.

12:22.957 --> 12:27.584
Jethro, Werth's behaviour is consistent
with post-traumatic stress,

12:27.754 --> 12:30.459
but he didn't harm De La Casa
unnecessarily.

12:30.632 --> 12:33.005
He still had the mental capacity
to booby-trap the car.

12:33.177 --> 12:36.048
Well, it shows that somewhere
in his mind, he's operating clearly.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.298
It's his training, Ducky.

12:39.267 --> 12:42.352
As a syndrome,
PTSD is in its infancy,

12:42.520 --> 12:46.139
even though the symptoms have long
been recognized by returning soldiers.

12:46.316 --> 12:47.514
Shell shock.

12:47.693 --> 12:50.813
Yeah, well,
there was a landmark legal case:

12:50.988 --> 12:53.396
The Buffalo Creek Disaster.

12:53.574 --> 12:55.567
A West Virginia
coal-mining community

12:55.743 --> 13:00.038
was utterly destroyed when a dam
gave way during a heavy rainstorm.

13:00.206 --> 13:03.161
Psychologists descended
upon the ruined valley

13:03.335 --> 13:06.704
to identify the common malady
that afflicted the survivors.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.795
Nightmares, insomnia, paranoia,
depression, memory loss.

13:10.968 --> 13:13.008
You know the symptoms well.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.211
And I'm of the opinion

13:15.390 --> 13:19.518
that Werth is replaying a scenario
that he's already completed.

13:19.686 --> 13:21.228
He thinks he's still at war.

13:21.396 --> 13:24.018
Well, it's not uncommon
for PTSD victims

13:24.191 --> 13:27.026
to respond to a trigger of some sort.

13:27.403 --> 13:30.855
I've read accounts
of Buffalo Creek survivors

13:31.032 --> 13:33.357
where they became hysterical
at the mere sound

13:33.535 --> 13:35.527
of raindrops on a tin roof.

13:35.704 --> 13:37.613
You think Werth has a trigger,
Ducky?

13:37.789 --> 13:40.411
I think you should be careful.

13:43.379 --> 13:47.128
McGee, David. Perimeter.

13:58.896 --> 14:00.390
That's Stone right there, agent.

14:00.564 --> 14:02.058
That's it, Nate.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.640
Don't be afraid
to put all your weight on it.

14:04.819 --> 14:05.850
It feels weird.

14:06.028 --> 14:08.946
It'll feel less weird
once you get used to it.

14:11.493 --> 14:13.402
- PFC Stone?
- Yes, sir.

14:14.204 --> 14:16.493
- Call me when you're done.
- Thanks, Karen.

14:16.665 --> 14:18.539
You heard from Corporal Werth?

14:18.709 --> 14:20.452
Got him in a brig in Bethesda.

14:20.628 --> 14:22.834
They won't even let me in
to see him.

14:23.256 --> 14:24.454
He broke out this morning.

14:24.632 --> 14:26.921
Good. He's not a prisoner.

14:27.093 --> 14:28.671
Shouldn't have been treated
that way.

14:28.845 --> 14:30.126
He may try to find you.

14:30.305 --> 14:33.010
Hope he does. He saved my life.

14:33.433 --> 14:35.592
I'd give it right back to him
if he needed it.

14:36.270 --> 14:40.019
Because of him, I might even be able
to return to combat.

14:40.608 --> 14:42.814
You do that, Devil Dog.

14:43.778 --> 14:45.438
Hoo-rah.

14:45.613 --> 14:49.446
Corporal Werth doesn't realize
that he ever left.

14:50.202 --> 14:51.862
He thinks you're in trouble.

14:52.037 --> 14:53.615
- Corporal wouldn't hurt me.
- Yeah.

14:53.789 --> 14:56.992
But would he hurt someone else
if they got in his way?

14:59.128 --> 15:00.955
What do you want from me?

15:01.506 --> 15:02.706
Let's see what we've got here.

15:03.258 --> 15:05.131
Cameras
on the north and south gates.

15:05.468 --> 15:08.173
Possible point of entry
from the fire escape.

15:10.474 --> 15:11.637
That's odd.

15:11.809 --> 15:13.636
Dr. De La Casa.
I thought he was headed home.

15:13.811 --> 15:15.186
Why would he come here?

15:15.354 --> 15:17.976
- He didn't.
- Werth has his badge.

15:21.110 --> 15:23.732
Gibbs, Werth is here.

15:27.242 --> 15:28.867
I know.

15:39.589 --> 15:41.582
Drop your weapons.

15:43.677 --> 15:45.420
Kick them away.

15:47.055 --> 15:48.514
You don't wanna do this, corporal.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.307
Nate, come on.
We're getting out of here.

15:50.476 --> 15:53.049
I'm okay, corporal. I'm safe.

15:53.688 --> 15:55.396
Stop moving.

15:55.565 --> 15:57.225
- We're not.
- The other two.

15:58.735 --> 16:02.484
PFC Stone, get up now.
That's an order.

16:07.953 --> 16:09.578
Your leg.

16:09.747 --> 16:11.740
I left it in the desert.

16:13.084 --> 16:15.919
Remember?
You carried me out on your back.

16:19.883 --> 16:21.294
Corporal, you're safe now.

16:21.718 --> 16:23.078
You and your men.
You rescued them.

16:23.220 --> 16:24.383
We're here to help you.

16:24.805 --> 16:28.221
Trust him, Damon. He's a grunt.

16:29.685 --> 16:31.559
He's one of us?

16:32.021 --> 16:34.310
Have to take you into custody.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.476
You understand that?

16:39.279 --> 16:40.857
Put it down.

16:47.121 --> 16:48.236
McGee, back off.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.239
Boss.

16:54.254 --> 16:56.330
Damon, what are you doing?

16:56.923 --> 16:58.632
Damon.

16:59.426 --> 17:01.426
- No, don't shoot him, don't shoot him.
- Sit down.

17:07.351 --> 17:08.762
Damon.

17:13.191 --> 17:14.602
Stay down.

17:25.997 --> 17:27.455
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

17:27.624 --> 17:28.984
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.370
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

17:30.543 --> 17:32.287
- Oh, my...
- Abby.

17:32.462 --> 17:33.625
Oh, my God, oh, my God...

17:33.797 --> 17:34.995
Abby.

17:35.174 --> 17:36.372
Calm down.

17:36.550 --> 17:38.958
Tony has a broken nose.
McGee has a dislocated shoulder.

17:39.136 --> 17:40.761
But we caught the guy.

17:40.930 --> 17:42.930
What is he even doing here?
He should be locked up.

17:43.099 --> 17:45.851
- He's an animal.
- He's not an animal.

17:46.019 --> 17:47.347
He's a man.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.560
Are you defending him?

17:49.731 --> 17:52.057
He attacked for no reason.
The guy's a killing machine.

17:52.234 --> 17:56.362
He's a Marine who is willing to give up
everything for his country.

17:56.739 --> 17:58.648
We have a responsibility to him.

17:59.158 --> 18:01.649
Oh, spare me
the samurai code of honour.

18:02.203 --> 18:04.160
Noble respect of your combatant?

18:04.330 --> 18:07.664
It's admirable, but he tried to kill Tony
and he tried to kill McGee.

18:07.834 --> 18:10.207
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God...

18:10.379 --> 18:11.577
And me too.

18:11.755 --> 18:14.329
Believe me. We are fine.

18:14.758 --> 18:16.550
Calm down.

18:18.513 --> 18:21.763
Ziva, can't you just let me
get it out for a second?

18:21.933 --> 18:23.096
I mean, I'm not like you.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.352
I'm not some totally emotionless
perfect warrior.

18:26.521 --> 18:28.348
God.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.191
Agent Gibbs,
you've met Karen Sutherland.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.444
Briefly.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.359
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.197
How are your people?

18:40.370 --> 18:42.290
They're busted up a little.
They'll be all right.

18:42.455 --> 18:46.916
Miss Sutherland is a research
and development engineer at Biotech.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.920
Defence contract?

18:49.296 --> 18:51.870
I specialize
in next-generation prosthesis.

18:52.049 --> 18:54.885
Designing, fitting, modifications.

18:55.595 --> 18:57.089
Lot of business lately.

18:57.263 --> 18:59.801
Too much, unfortunately.

18:59.975 --> 19:03.723
But we're trying to create
something positive out of all the loss.

19:03.895 --> 19:06.565
You've seen your share
of traumatized warriors?

19:07.566 --> 19:08.811
I'm sure 30 years ago,

19:08.984 --> 19:12.069
most of the returning vets you work
with would have died in the field.

19:12.238 --> 19:15.654
Well, broken bodies are easier to heal
than broken minds.

19:15.825 --> 19:18.067
My company also develops
alternative therapies

19:18.244 --> 19:20.570
to treat the psychological conditions.

19:20.747 --> 19:23.073
Competition for DARPA funding
must be intense.

19:23.250 --> 19:24.329
If I may.

19:24.501 --> 19:26.079
What's going to happen
to Corporal Werth

19:26.253 --> 19:27.748
now that he's in your custody?

19:30.091 --> 19:31.633
Why exactly do you wanna know?

19:32.885 --> 19:34.428
Personal curiosity.

19:34.596 --> 19:38.261
It seems a great many people
are interested in Werth's well-being.

19:38.433 --> 19:41.600
I've had several calls
from Senator Hawkins' office

19:41.770 --> 19:43.929
about a Silver Star presentation.

19:44.106 --> 19:45.766
Werth abducted
a Navy medical officer,

19:45.941 --> 19:47.602
assaulted Federal agents.

19:47.777 --> 19:50.612
But you don't intend to charge him.
He was not in his right mind.

19:50.780 --> 19:52.856
Then he should probably go back
to the shrinks.

19:53.032 --> 19:55.156
For all the good it did
first time around.

19:58.246 --> 20:00.619
What would you have us do with him,
Miss Sutherland?

20:03.085 --> 20:04.710
Well, that's not my place.

20:05.463 --> 20:08.666
I just witnessed his incident.
It was frightening.

20:08.841 --> 20:09.956
I'm concerned.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.675
We all are.

20:14.264 --> 20:17.384
What do you intend to do
with Corporal Werth, Agent Gibbs?

20:19.061 --> 20:20.639
Talk to him.

20:21.105 --> 20:23.228
Marine to Marine.

20:35.954 --> 20:38.410
Why didn't you have that
looked at in the ER?

20:38.582 --> 20:40.456
I am fine.

20:40.626 --> 20:42.666
You shouldn't be embarrassed.

20:42.837 --> 20:46.787
Invincibility
is not a human characteristic.

20:46.966 --> 20:48.627
Gibbs is going to interrogate him?

20:48.802 --> 20:51.008
Yes, well,
I'm sure that Gunnery Sergeant Gibbs

20:51.179 --> 20:56.767
has a notion of how to get through
to Corporal Werth's troubled mind.

21:05.028 --> 21:08.195
You got yourself in a mess,
corporal.

21:10.492 --> 21:13.030
You'll have to get yourself out.

21:14.371 --> 21:16.779
What seems to be the problem?

21:17.625 --> 21:19.867
What seems to be the problem,
Marine?

21:20.044 --> 21:21.289
I wanna kill someone, sir.

21:21.462 --> 21:22.708
Anyone in particular?

21:22.881 --> 21:25.206
Anyone will do, sir.

21:27.177 --> 21:30.048
Does that feel right to you, son?

21:32.141 --> 21:35.925
No, sir, it does not.

21:37.188 --> 21:41.767
I'm not right, sir,
but it's not my fault.

21:43.445 --> 21:45.734
Tell me what it feels like.

21:48.409 --> 21:49.986
Needles and pills.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.192
Needles and pins?

21:51.370 --> 21:54.704
No, sir. Needles and pills.

21:55.875 --> 21:58.449
They put a cloud in my head.

21:59.087 --> 22:02.622
It's dark behind my eyes.
I can't see in there.

22:03.675 --> 22:05.633
Who drugged you?

22:08.597 --> 22:09.760
I don't know.

22:11.559 --> 22:16.221
I can't find it. I can't remember.

22:18.984 --> 22:20.264
You've gotta help me.

22:22.237 --> 22:24.230
At ease, son.

22:25.783 --> 22:27.610
I will.

22:37.379 --> 22:41.875
His symptoms are in no way exclusive
to post-traumatic stress.

22:42.050 --> 22:43.082
You believe him?

22:43.260 --> 22:45.632
Irritability, delusion, hostility.

22:46.013 --> 22:48.302
All of these
could be an adverse reaction

22:48.474 --> 22:50.134
to any number of medications.

22:50.309 --> 22:55.102
And in his field evaluation,
I found references to anxiety, paranoia.

22:55.273 --> 22:56.593
And they all predate his capture.

22:56.733 --> 22:57.764
Too long in Iraq.

22:57.943 --> 23:00.149
I do not get the impression
he suffered in the field.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.728
Yes, that does seem
to be his natural habitat.

23:02.907 --> 23:05.149
Look,
you have established a rapport.

23:05.326 --> 23:09.027
Perhaps you could convince him
to part with urine and blood samples.

23:09.205 --> 23:10.997
I made a promise to this Marine.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.874
I plan to keep it.

23:14.336 --> 23:16.375
So I guess he's a liar too.

23:16.546 --> 23:19.631
Other than low concentrations
of sedatives and antidepressants,

23:19.800 --> 23:21.378
his blood was clean of drugs.

23:21.552 --> 23:25.799
Well, the results of Werth's urinalysis
should confirm that, then.

23:25.973 --> 23:29.425
I can't just turn off
one part of my head right now

23:29.602 --> 23:31.263
and turn on the other part.

23:31.438 --> 23:32.897
Abby.

23:33.648 --> 23:36.270
You know what? I don't even care.

23:37.194 --> 23:38.938
Abby, Abby.

23:39.113 --> 23:42.316
I need you to draw upon
that considerable capacity

23:42.491 --> 23:45.695
that you have for empathy
for a moment.

23:45.870 --> 23:47.744
I don't wanna help him.

23:47.914 --> 23:50.121
This young man
you deem to be a villain

23:50.292 --> 23:52.035
may in fact be a victim.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.294
What are we looking for?

23:59.468 --> 24:02.505
Probenecid, spironolactone,
furosemide

24:02.680 --> 24:06.548
and any other uricosurics
and diuretics.

24:06.726 --> 24:08.849
Masking agents.

24:16.070 --> 24:17.730
Oh, look at me.

24:17.905 --> 24:21.820
Like Jack Nicholson in Chinatown.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.651
Oh, stupid can.

24:29.543 --> 24:32.627
You know what happened
to the kitty cat who got too curious?

24:33.798 --> 24:38.009
Don't make me break out my Jack,
because I will.

24:41.055 --> 24:42.680
- Straw?
- No, I'm good.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.260
I got the one arm. Thank you.

24:44.434 --> 24:45.928
Maybe it was you, McGee.

24:46.395 --> 24:48.352
The one-armed man.

24:49.064 --> 24:53.109
Thought it was one of those vets
we met at the Walter Reed Hospital.

24:53.986 --> 24:56.026
Wrong case, Tony.

24:56.197 --> 24:59.447
Do we even have a case?
We already got the guy.

24:59.617 --> 25:01.112
What are we doing?

25:01.286 --> 25:03.492
What did we miss?

25:04.581 --> 25:05.660
What's happening?

25:07.126 --> 25:08.703
They gave him painkillers.

25:09.837 --> 25:11.628
My fingers are finging.

25:13.883 --> 25:14.962
You hear that?

25:16.719 --> 25:18.796
Excellent work, Agent Gibbs.

25:18.972 --> 25:20.550
You will be receiving
a commendation...

25:20.724 --> 25:21.803
Where is he?

25:22.184 --> 25:23.464
Orders from SECNAV.

25:23.644 --> 25:26.016
Werth is being transferred back
to Bethesda.

25:26.188 --> 25:27.517
The doctor will see to him.

25:27.690 --> 25:29.450
Make sure he's presentable
for your photo op?

25:29.608 --> 25:32.064
The man is entitled to his medal.

25:33.196 --> 25:34.716
All you care about is selling the war.

25:35.824 --> 25:37.733
You don't support the war?

25:39.369 --> 25:41.077
I support the men fighting it.

25:44.500 --> 25:48.332
Jethro, a complex series
of masking agents

25:48.504 --> 25:51.671
hampered detection,
but we managed to find oxymetholone

25:51.841 --> 25:53.549
stacked with nandrolone.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.378
In addition,
countless other compounds

25:55.554 --> 25:58.045
that we have yet to identify.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.346
Anabolic steroids.

26:00.517 --> 26:01.715
Steroids?

26:01.894 --> 26:03.436
Yeah, well, testosterone levels

26:03.604 --> 26:05.846
far beyond even the most reckless
of body builders.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.895
The science at work here
is very advanced,

26:09.068 --> 26:11.524
with every indication
that it's been going on for years.

26:11.988 --> 26:16.900
Werth's behaviour is likely the result
of steroid-induced psychosis.

26:20.956 --> 26:24.456
Someone is using that Marine
as a lab rat.

26:29.883 --> 26:31.626
Abby is mapping
Werth's blood work.

26:31.801 --> 26:33.878
Already found a bunch of steroids,
well-covered.

26:34.054 --> 26:37.139
Would have been masked
from standard drug testing.

26:37.307 --> 26:38.968
Drug testing is big bucks, McGiggle.

26:39.143 --> 26:42.393
NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball,
they all face the same problem.

26:42.563 --> 26:44.223
Don't forget the Tour de France.

26:44.399 --> 26:46.226
Oh, how could I?
Those short little shorts.

26:46.401 --> 26:48.121
He could've been injected
his entire career.

26:48.236 --> 26:50.608
Werth is not just a Marine
with post-traumatic stress.

26:50.781 --> 26:53.069
Someone has tried
to create a super soldier.

26:54.076 --> 26:55.274
He's in a hospital bed.

26:56.245 --> 26:59.910
Weak, 19 years old.
He's just been rejected by the Corps.

27:00.082 --> 27:03.249
His dream of becoming a Marine,
over before it starts.

27:03.419 --> 27:06.337
Because he's Four F.
Has an anaemic blood disorder.

27:06.506 --> 27:08.466
Three years later,
he's ripping through boot camp.

27:08.592 --> 27:10.216
Attending physician
calls the improvement

27:10.385 --> 27:11.963
in his blood-cell count miraculous.

27:12.137 --> 27:13.797
It's not a miracle. It's an experiment.

27:13.973 --> 27:16.428
Someone turned Damon Werth
into Captain America.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.637
Werth's Swiss-cheese brain means
he can't name the mad scientist.

27:20.146 --> 27:22.518
Any chance the attending
was Dr. De La Casa?

27:22.690 --> 27:24.101
No such luck. As far as I can tell,

27:24.275 --> 27:26.155
they didn't cross paths
till a couple weeks ago.

27:26.319 --> 27:29.274
Then who? Who would benefit
from an experiment like this?

27:29.448 --> 27:31.275
Well, there's big money
in pharmaceuticals.

27:31.825 --> 27:32.857
What?

27:33.035 --> 27:35.491
Find out what kind of research
the Biotech Corporation does,

27:35.663 --> 27:37.786
and everything on
Karen Sutherland.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.036
- DiNozzo?
- Yeah, boss.

27:39.208 --> 27:40.833
You're with me.

27:41.002 --> 27:44.122
The pursuit of juicy government
contracts spurs a lot of R and D.

27:44.297 --> 27:45.495
Yeah, it runs the gamut

27:45.674 --> 27:48.628
from pills that will keep a person
awake for days at a time,

27:48.802 --> 27:54.307
to biomechanical exoskeletons,
to nanoparticle technology.

27:54.684 --> 27:56.475
A hell of a company.

27:56.644 --> 27:59.218
Feel like James Bond
walking into Q's laboratory.

27:59.397 --> 28:02.849
Well, DARPA's money did pay for
night vision, lasers and stealth.

28:03.026 --> 28:04.686
And the Internet.

28:04.861 --> 28:08.990
That's a light-emitting diode.
It speeds the healing process.

28:09.408 --> 28:12.824
Might help the damaged cartilage
in your nose, Agent DiNozzo.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.822
Your company builds super soldiers.

28:14.998 --> 28:17.667
Not a term we use in-house,
Agent Gibbs.

28:17.834 --> 28:19.459
Connotes killing power.

28:19.628 --> 28:22.201
Our mission is to increase
human effectiveness,

28:22.381 --> 28:23.958
durability and longevity.

28:24.508 --> 28:25.967
What point
in the development process

28:26.135 --> 28:28.127
do you begin field-testing
on human subjects?

28:28.304 --> 28:30.261
Oh, we're subject
to government oversight.

28:30.431 --> 28:31.842
Oh, that's too bad.

28:32.016 --> 28:35.848
All these cool toys and someone else
tells you how to play with them.

28:36.020 --> 28:39.306
Can I ask a question? You ever jump
the gun a bit with the magic pills?

28:39.483 --> 28:42.152
Cut through the red tape?
Work out the kinks?

28:42.319 --> 28:43.398
In-house?

28:44.655 --> 28:45.935
Corporal Werth.

28:46.115 --> 28:48.321
His condition
is pharmaceutically-based.

28:48.492 --> 28:49.572
Steroids.

28:49.744 --> 28:51.984
I appreciate you've taken
a special interest in his case.

28:52.121 --> 28:54.114
Oh, and you too.

28:54.374 --> 28:56.414
He's highly decorated.

28:56.585 --> 28:58.043
You're highly decorated.

28:58.211 --> 29:01.415
Silver Star? That's a lot in common.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.419
You've done your research.

29:04.969 --> 29:06.547
That's the word on my door.

29:07.722 --> 29:11.305
Well, he is a Marine
and you're an ex-Marine.

29:11.476 --> 29:14.050
No such thing as ex-Marines.

29:14.729 --> 29:17.221
Put your lives in each other's hands,

29:17.816 --> 29:20.307
accept that you're part
of something greater.

29:20.486 --> 29:22.609
- That sounds like a religion.
- No.

29:23.489 --> 29:25.114
More a faith.

29:26.576 --> 29:29.660
Well,
steroids are extremely hazardous.

29:30.163 --> 29:32.571
Carry many health risks.

29:32.791 --> 29:34.333
I wish I could help you, Agent Gibbs,

29:34.501 --> 29:40.504
but our company does not conduct
dangerous experiments

29:40.674 --> 29:42.667
on human test subjects.

29:47.766 --> 29:50.008
I case you were wondering,
he doesn't care about medals.

29:50.185 --> 29:51.264
I keep his in a drawer.

29:54.606 --> 29:55.638
She's lying.

29:56.275 --> 29:57.354
Of course she is.

29:57.526 --> 30:00.064
They do human testing
on power drinks, why not Biotech?

30:00.237 --> 30:03.938
Abby, I really... I need my arm
to access these financial records.

30:05.326 --> 30:06.607
You have nothing to do?

30:07.120 --> 30:10.988
I created a blueprint of all
the compounds that Werth was given.

30:11.166 --> 30:13.242
If you can find me
an existing experiment,

30:13.419 --> 30:15.910
I can match it and prove
that he was their guinea pig.

30:16.088 --> 30:18.461
I need to get Biotech
to open their ultra-secret books.

30:18.633 --> 30:21.836
If there's anything you can do
that could get you off of me...

30:22.011 --> 30:25.297
Tony, I'm so glad you...

30:27.184 --> 30:28.464
smell like garbage.

30:28.644 --> 30:30.601
Yeah, I know.

30:30.771 --> 30:32.645
I was going through
Karen Sutherland's trash.

30:32.815 --> 30:35.816
- Find anything?
- She recycles and composts.

30:36.277 --> 30:37.392
Who composts?

30:37.570 --> 30:40.820
Those are pretty extreme lengths
to go to for this guy.

30:41.366 --> 30:44.153
But I understand now.

30:44.744 --> 30:49.323
No true warrior
should be felled by invisible forces.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.828
It's dishonourable.

30:56.174 --> 31:00.254
And that other thing I said,
I know that's not really true.

31:03.306 --> 31:06.758
What does that mean,
what she just said?

31:06.935 --> 31:08.513
What other thing?

31:08.687 --> 31:11.439
That I do not have feelings.
I do have feelings.

31:11.607 --> 31:14.015
Though I do not express myself
the way Abby does.

31:14.193 --> 31:16.945
No one expresses themself
the way Abby does.

31:17.113 --> 31:20.280
Themself. Themselves? Themself.

31:21.326 --> 31:24.126
What were you having feelings about?
You said you were having feelings.

31:24.288 --> 31:27.538
I said I have feelings,
not that I'm having feelings.

31:27.708 --> 31:30.579
That is a pretty sophisticated
grammatical differentiation.

31:30.753 --> 31:33.505
Don't change the subject
with your big words, McNerd.

31:33.673 --> 31:35.333
Ziva said she had a feeling.

31:35.508 --> 31:37.051
Tell us about this feeling.

31:37.218 --> 31:38.464
What was this feeling?

31:39.179 --> 31:45.015
I felt overwhelmed temporarily...

31:45.185 --> 31:47.807
Which does not often happen to me.

31:48.147 --> 31:50.638
When we were wrestling
with Werth.

31:52.360 --> 31:55.030
What? What is this look?

31:55.196 --> 31:56.276
Nothing.

31:57.574 --> 31:59.318
You like him.

31:59.701 --> 32:01.279
I thought he was powerful.

32:01.453 --> 32:02.485
You really like him.

32:02.663 --> 32:05.450
No, I am saying he's stronger
than any man I have encountered,

32:05.624 --> 32:09.076
but strength
should not decide a battle.

32:09.253 --> 32:10.914
There is a weapon for every fight.

32:11.089 --> 32:12.120
Itching for a rematch?

32:12.298 --> 32:14.018
Wanna roll on the ground
with him some more?

32:14.175 --> 32:17.130
I am trying
to describe something complicated.

32:17.304 --> 32:19.593
It's not complicated, Ziva.
It's Conan.

32:19.765 --> 32:21.805
- To her Red Sonja.
- Nice.

32:21.976 --> 32:23.885
It only lasted a moment.

32:24.061 --> 32:27.347
You had a moment.
A moment and a feeling.

32:27.523 --> 32:28.768
And a smack to the head.

32:28.942 --> 32:31.611
Broken nose. Dislocated shoulder.
It's been a banner day.

32:31.778 --> 32:34.400
Easy on the painkillers, DiNozzo.

32:34.573 --> 32:36.032
Director have any luck, boss?

32:36.200 --> 32:38.655
Public-affairs guy is stonewalling.

32:38.827 --> 32:41.947
His main concern is keeping Werth
docile for the ceremony.

32:42.123 --> 32:44.115
They don't wanna know
how he got that way.

32:44.292 --> 32:45.620
Or they know already.

32:45.793 --> 32:48.415
- What do we know?
- Well, it looks like Karen Sutherland

32:48.588 --> 32:50.877
is the bleeding heart
she appears to be.

32:51.049 --> 32:53.125
Volunteer consultant
with Doctors Without Borders.

32:53.302 --> 32:56.256
Donates to several charities
for the mentally disabled.

32:56.430 --> 32:58.802
If she's got a fault,
it's that she cares too much.

32:58.974 --> 33:01.382
Which is something
we might be able to exploit, boss.

33:02.437 --> 33:04.809
I told you,
that information is proprietary.

33:04.981 --> 33:06.101
I can't discuss it with you.

33:06.274 --> 33:07.852
Cutting-edge research.

33:08.026 --> 33:11.312
Financial temptation
must be hard to resist.

33:11.488 --> 33:14.489
You're wasting your time
if you think I'm selling secrets.

33:14.658 --> 33:15.738
McGee.

33:15.910 --> 33:18.911
You spent your summer traveling
through Africa with a team of doctors.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.156
You've been poking around my life.

33:21.332 --> 33:22.364
Only fair.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.159
This report
from the World Health Organization

33:25.337 --> 33:28.421
features several children who received
treatment for land-mine injuries.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.666
Called their rapid healing
"miraculous."

33:30.843 --> 33:33.215
I hear "miracle," I look for answers.

33:33.387 --> 33:35.047
Can't just take it on faith, huh?

33:35.222 --> 33:36.882
You didn't sell any secrets.

33:37.350 --> 33:38.548
You gave them away for free.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.435
Your heart's in the right place.

33:40.603 --> 33:43.854
Your LED device is low-cost,
highly-effective,

33:44.024 --> 33:45.222
but it is corporate property.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.025
The super-soldier program.

33:52.449 --> 33:57.907
If anything on this comes back to me,
my career is over.

33:59.791 --> 34:02.247
Hope it answers all your questions.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.371
You could've just asked nicely.

34:06.548 --> 34:08.458
This is nicely.

34:12.388 --> 34:15.058
Platelet acceleration,
human growth hormone

34:15.224 --> 34:17.632
and cybernetic implants.

34:17.811 --> 34:20.646
These people have read
way too many sci-fi comics.

34:20.813 --> 34:23.387
Some of these experiments
are more fi than sci.

34:23.567 --> 34:25.226
One of them makes people
glow in the dark.

34:25.402 --> 34:26.731
What do we got?

34:27.029 --> 34:29.235
- A couple of surprises.
- Good or bad?

34:29.407 --> 34:34.746
Well, would it surprise you to learn
that Karen Sutherland has reviewed

34:34.913 --> 34:38.197
every single human research project at
her company since you met with her?

34:38.583 --> 34:40.291
Timestamps
on files she downloaded.

34:40.460 --> 34:42.252
Worried her company
might be responsible.

34:42.420 --> 34:43.500
Are they?

34:43.672 --> 34:46.293
For questionable experiments,
definitely, but as far as our guy...

34:46.467 --> 34:48.376
This is the map I compiled

34:48.552 --> 34:51.672
of all the chemical compounds that
are running through Werth's blood.

34:52.139 --> 34:55.426
This is a blueprint
of the chemical compounds

34:55.601 --> 34:57.642
the Biotech Corporation
is experimenting with.

34:57.813 --> 34:59.141
- None of them match.
- No.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.106
Werth's not their test subject.

35:01.275 --> 35:04.395
Sutherland will be relieved.
She's not responsible.

35:04.945 --> 35:06.190
Someone else is.

35:13.705 --> 35:15.265
Well, the director managed
to get a list

35:15.415 --> 35:17.975
of every super-soldier proposal
competing for funding from DARPA.

35:18.126 --> 35:19.502
None involve steroids.

35:19.670 --> 35:22.873
Whatever's been done to Werth
was somebody's pet project,

35:23.048 --> 35:24.248
but they didn't leave a trail.

35:24.425 --> 35:26.545
He's the only evidence
the experiment ever took place.

35:26.677 --> 35:29.085
- The only one who knows who did it.
- If he could remember.

35:29.264 --> 35:30.544
So if the experiment went wrong,

35:30.724 --> 35:34.175
and Werth's behaviour over the past
several days would suggest it has,

35:34.352 --> 35:35.598
then if he does remember...

35:35.771 --> 35:37.230
He's in danger.

35:37.397 --> 35:38.808
We need to protect him.

35:40.693 --> 35:42.613
Well, all that's standing in our way
is a senator

35:42.778 --> 35:44.570
and the entire
Military Medical Complex.

35:44.739 --> 35:46.179
I'm sure they'll be happy to see us.

35:46.658 --> 35:47.820
Oh, no.

35:47.992 --> 35:49.487
Nothing, sir. I'm losing you.

35:49.661 --> 35:51.203
Sunspots, X-rays, tunnel.

35:51.371 --> 35:53.743
Agent Gibbs, you and your team
are not welcome here.

35:53.916 --> 35:56.158
You are not to interfere
with Corporal Werth's treatment.

35:56.335 --> 35:57.710
I will have you forcibly removed.

35:58.712 --> 36:00.088
Sorry about that. Clumsy.

36:00.256 --> 36:01.916
Not supposed to use those
in the hospital.

36:02.091 --> 36:03.585
Especially my hospital.

36:09.099 --> 36:12.515
Corporal Werth is safe here,
except perhaps from himself.

36:12.686 --> 36:14.686
You'll excuse us
if we don't take you at your word.

36:14.855 --> 36:18.189
Look, I'm taking every measure
to rectify past mistakes.

36:18.359 --> 36:20.731
I'm ashamed to admit
I missed the diagnosis.

36:20.903 --> 36:23.110
You verified Dr. Mallard's findings?

36:23.281 --> 36:25.108
Werth is on a rapid detox program.

36:25.283 --> 36:27.843
We should flush his system
of the steroids in three to five days.

36:27.994 --> 36:30.074
Is there a reason we had to do
all your work for you?

36:31.874 --> 36:35.160
Well, we try our best but we can't
keep up with the numbers.

36:35.461 --> 36:36.901
We don't have the time or facilities

36:37.046 --> 36:40.914
to extend that type of attention to
every patient who presents with PTSD.

36:41.426 --> 36:43.217
I want to see him.

36:44.387 --> 36:46.380
He's under heavy sedation.
He's fine.

36:46.848 --> 36:49.600
No, she asked to see the patient.

36:49.768 --> 36:52.722
Probably not a good idea
to stand in her way.

36:58.069 --> 36:59.611
Jeez.

37:03.658 --> 37:06.280
What, no funny movie reference?

37:06.453 --> 37:07.995
It's not funny.

37:08.163 --> 37:11.663
The lV contains clonazepam
while his system clears itself.

37:11.834 --> 37:14.621
- Can he speak?
- He's somewhat clear when awake.

37:14.796 --> 37:16.254
Is his mind returning?

37:16.631 --> 37:18.090
I hope so.

37:18.425 --> 37:21.426
Corporal Werth. Damon.

37:25.516 --> 37:27.923
- Where am I?
- Hospital.

37:31.564 --> 37:33.106
What's all this?

37:33.274 --> 37:34.768
We're getting the steroids
out of you.

37:34.943 --> 37:37.398
- Steroids?
- Yeah.

37:37.737 --> 37:40.193
- You remember?
- Who did this to you?

37:43.952 --> 37:45.447
Who did this to me?

37:46.163 --> 37:48.370
Damon? Damon?

37:48.541 --> 37:49.572
Hey, Damon.

37:49.750 --> 37:50.870
Like I said, he's very weak.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.461
Damon.

37:54.380 --> 37:56.872
- Wait. This isn't right.
- What's happening?

37:57.050 --> 37:59.588
His system is crashing.
It's set too high.

37:59.803 --> 38:02.129
- What is that?
- Adrenaline.

38:02.306 --> 38:03.385
Hold him down.

38:05.810 --> 38:07.518
Hold him, hold him. Give it to him.

38:07.979 --> 38:10.137
You're gonna be all right, Marine.

38:13.318 --> 38:15.987
- He's pulling a Pulp Fiction.
- Or The Hulk.

38:53.612 --> 38:55.688
- What just happened?
- I don't understand this.

38:56.740 --> 38:58.863
His machine was cranked up
to the wrong level.

38:59.034 --> 39:02.071
- The sedative was poisoning him.
- So you tried to kill him?

39:02.246 --> 39:05.034
Bury the evidence
of your little science experiment?

39:05.208 --> 39:07.366
I don't understand this.
I set the rate.

39:07.961 --> 39:10.369
Wrote the orders clear as day.

39:11.214 --> 39:13.706
Who carries out your orders?

39:16.220 --> 39:18.545
Jenkins. Going down?

39:33.405 --> 39:34.948
I said going down.

39:35.116 --> 39:36.491
You should probably stay down.

39:37.785 --> 39:39.114
That's a nice watch.

39:39.287 --> 39:41.078
A little ostentatious for my taste.

39:41.247 --> 39:42.487
Must have been hell to pay for.

39:42.624 --> 39:44.830
Especially on an orderly's salary.

39:47.004 --> 39:48.284
Found a loophole in the system.

39:48.755 --> 39:49.918
Doctors fill out orders.

39:50.090 --> 39:51.549
You take the drugs
from the pharmacy.

39:51.717 --> 39:54.718
But occasionally, they don't make it
to their intended destination.

39:54.887 --> 39:58.303
Yeah, you made quite a little business
out of that, haven't you?

39:59.267 --> 40:02.054
What is the street value
of nandrolone

40:02.228 --> 40:05.265
and oxymetholone and Winstrol?

40:05.440 --> 40:07.766
You even know
what these things do?

40:08.110 --> 40:09.688
Liver, kidney disease.

40:09.862 --> 40:12.104
Sterility, roid rage.

40:12.281 --> 40:16.943
This guy here
beat his wife half to death.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.531
At least three others are dead.

40:18.705 --> 40:20.283
They're all patients of yours.

40:20.457 --> 40:22.117
Look, they did that to themselves.

40:22.292 --> 40:25.626
Werth goes off the reservation.
The cops are circling the hospital.

40:25.796 --> 40:29.165
And then someone
amps his machine up to 11.

40:29.341 --> 40:31.963
I don't know what happened,
all right?

40:32.136 --> 40:34.056
I mean, these things
can be unreliable sometimes.

40:34.180 --> 40:35.540
Didn't want Werth to start talking

40:35.682 --> 40:37.342
about who was sticking
a needle in him?

40:37.517 --> 40:40.554
Listen, I didn't stick the needle
in any of those guys.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.686
Who did?

40:49.780 --> 40:51.857
I'm embarrassed by my behaviour.

40:52.533 --> 40:55.488
It doesn't even feel like me
in my memory.

40:55.662 --> 40:58.200
We have determined
the source of the steroids,

40:58.373 --> 40:59.998
but not who did this to you.

41:00.167 --> 41:01.958
You remember?

41:02.711 --> 41:05.333
- It hasn't come back yet.
- That's disappointing.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.000
Would have to be someone
close to you,

41:07.174 --> 41:09.001
someone who has been with you
wherever you go.

41:09.177 --> 41:10.375
Perhaps someone in your unit.

41:10.553 --> 41:12.095
We have to investigate them.

41:14.849 --> 41:18.016
Unless you remember who it is.

41:22.942 --> 41:25.896
Courage doesn't have anything to do
with medals.

41:26.362 --> 41:28.022
It's simple.

41:28.197 --> 41:30.486
You run to the gunfire.

41:30.658 --> 41:31.857
Not away from it.

41:34.329 --> 41:39.205
I don't know what I'd do, Gunny,
if I couldn't be a Marine.

41:40.586 --> 41:41.784
It's in my blood.

41:43.923 --> 41:45.714
I can't imagine how it felt...

41:49.179 --> 41:51.385
when your own blood
was keeping you out.

41:51.723 --> 41:54.095
The orderly
was just your most recent supplier.

41:55.060 --> 41:58.180
You gave yourself the steroids
and the masking agents

41:58.355 --> 42:00.894
so no one would ever find out.

42:01.067 --> 42:04.103
All so you could become
some super Marine.

42:05.071 --> 42:08.156
No. Just a Marine.

42:12.079 --> 42:13.822
That's it. Ceremony's off.

42:14.623 --> 42:16.532
- You're cancelling it?
- Have to.

42:16.709 --> 42:18.509
The senator can't step on stage
with that guy.

42:18.627 --> 42:20.627
- He won't get the medal?
- That's up to the Corps.

42:20.797 --> 42:21.959
But I sincerely doubt it.

42:22.131 --> 42:26.675
He'll be lucky to be just discharged.
This is a nightmare.

42:27.846 --> 42:29.554
Ray Vincent.

42:30.766 --> 42:32.390
Is planning to appear on Hardball.

42:32.559 --> 42:33.722
- When?
- 7 tonight.

42:33.894 --> 42:36.302
Great. I'm on my way.
