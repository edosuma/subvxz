01:26.836 --> 01:31.432
<i>It was 1957 and we're driving</i>
<i>from Florida to Utah.</i>

01:31.608 --> 01:34.475
<i>After my mother was beaten</i>
<i>by her boyfriend...</i>

01:34.644 --> 01:37.169
<i>... we hightailed it</i>
<i>for the uranium fields.</i>

01:37.347 --> 01:39.645
<i>We were gonna change our luck...</i>

01:39.816 --> 01:43.752
<i>... which hadn't been so hot since</i>
<i>our family broke up five years ago.</i>

01:43.920 --> 01:49.756
I spy with my little eye
something that begins with C.

01:49.926 --> 01:51.757
- Cactus. Cactus.
- Nope.

01:51.928 --> 01:54.419
- No?
- It's upwards.

01:54.597 --> 01:58.556
- Up. Up in the...
- Clouds. Clouds.

02:00.170 --> 02:01.194
Okay, your turn.

02:01.371 --> 02:05.603
<i>I was caught up in my mother's freedom,</i>
<i>her delight in her freedom.</i>

02:05.775 --> 02:10.211
<i>She was going to get rich on uranium</i>
<i>and I was going to help her.</i>

02:50.253 --> 02:55.418
- How does this thing work, anyway?
- Well, I think it causes like a...

02:55.592 --> 02:59.756
It makes a black light that causes
uranium traces to glow.

03:00.396 --> 03:03.331
We can walk along the street
and find uranium?

03:03.499 --> 03:06.593
Well, it was everywhere
in Moab, they say.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.327
We were too late in Moab.

03:08.504 --> 03:12.167
That guy said nobody had found
uranium in Salt Lake City.

03:12.342 --> 03:15.243
That means we'll have
the place to ourselves, huh?

03:15.411 --> 03:17.845
- Yeah.
- This could be a big break for us.

03:18.014 --> 03:20.676
If this works out,
just think about it.

03:20.850 --> 03:26.254
We could get a real house
and we could get rid of this damn Nash.

03:26.422 --> 03:29.118
We'd have no more money worries.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.921
It'd be just like
heaven on a June day.

03:34.597 --> 03:37.760
Heaven on a June day.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.805
Damn it.

03:49.979 --> 03:55.178
If I had one wish right now, only one
wish, you know what it would be?

03:55.351 --> 03:59.981
I'd like to burn this
goddamn Nash to a crisp.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.283
I'm serious. I hate it.

04:02.458 --> 04:06.258
I hate the man who invented it.
I hate the factory who produced it.

04:06.429 --> 04:08.795
Almost makes me want to see Roy.

04:08.965 --> 04:12.594
He was the only one who could
make it stop overheating.

04:12.769 --> 04:17.262
My God, he was boring.
Boring and mean.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.375
You sure got crappy
taste in boyfriends.

04:22.412 --> 04:25.813
Come on, let's go get
rich in Salt Lake.

04:39.295 --> 04:42.423
Wait a minute.
You're pulling my leg, right?

04:42.598 --> 04:45.499
No. We came here to look for uranium.

04:45.668 --> 04:49.536
If you're looking for uranium,
why didn't you go to Moab?

04:49.706 --> 04:52.300
We went there,
but everybody beat us.

04:52.475 --> 04:56.241
So you came here just
on the chance you'd find uranium?

04:56.412 --> 04:57.970
Yeah.

04:58.414 --> 05:02.282
Do you mind me saying something
that might sound rude?

05:02.452 --> 05:07.253
Lady, you got more courage
than you got common sense.

05:16.132 --> 05:19.465
- So, what'd the man say?
- Don't ask.

05:32.915 --> 05:36.715
<i>My mom had her own way of solving</i>
<i>problems. She left them behind.</i>

05:36.886 --> 05:39.684
<i>That's what she</i>
<i>did with the Nash, just left it.</i>

05:39.856 --> 05:43.815
Things are going to start looking up.
I can feel it.

05:43.993 --> 05:45.824
The good times are coming.

05:45.995 --> 05:49.658
<i>My mom had high hopes,</i>
<i>especially for me.</i>

05:49.832 --> 05:53.324
<i>I'd been giving her no end</i>
<i>of grief since she left Dad.</i>

05:53.503 --> 05:57.564
<i>I decided I was gonna do better.</i>
<i>I'd have straight</i>- <i>arrow friends.</i>

05:57.740 --> 06:01.938
<i>I was gonna get all A 's in school</i>
<i>and keep my nose clean.</i>

06:02.111 --> 06:04.011
<i>I promised it and meant it.</i>

06:06.849 --> 06:09.750
We give new boys
the benefit of the doubt.

06:09.919 --> 06:13.411
This is the second time
you've been in front of me.

06:13.589 --> 06:18.026
I think you'd better give your mother
a call, tell her to come down here.

06:18.194 --> 06:20.424
She works.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.629
She's working.

06:24.767 --> 06:27.759
- It wasn't me who broke their window.
- Please.

06:27.937 --> 06:31.873
- Believe them instead of me.
- Lf you care for me, be quiet.

06:32.041 --> 06:36.671
If you'd cared anything about me,
you would've stayed married to Dad.

06:37.146 --> 06:39.376
<i>I didn't really mean that.</i>

06:39.549 --> 06:41.176
<i>I knew it wasn't true.</i>

06:41.350 --> 06:44.615
<i>My father went his own way</i>
<i>before they called it quits...</i>

06:44.787 --> 06:48.018
<i>... and took my older brother,</i>
<i>Gregory, with him.</i>

06:49.992 --> 06:55.191
<i>Sometimes I had to blame somebody,</i>
<i>and she was the only one there.</i>

07:35.238 --> 07:37.638
- What time is it?
- 7, almost.

07:37.807 --> 07:39.866
Why didn't you wake me?

07:40.042 --> 07:45.139
I started dinner. The potatoes are
frying and I'm heating up hot dogs.

07:54.924 --> 07:58.360
- I'm sorry.
- I know you are.

07:58.528 --> 08:02.487
I know your father doesn't call
and your brother doesn't write...

08:02.665 --> 08:06.931
...but you know it's not my fault.
- I know.

08:07.103 --> 08:08.593
Okay.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.502
Hello?

08:16.145 --> 08:17.908
Hello, Roy.

08:21.450 --> 08:23.941
A Winchester! Thanks.

08:24.820 --> 08:29.814
I found me a room. But it's clear
the hell and gone across town.

08:30.793 --> 08:36.197
And I think I got a job lined up doing
tune-ups at a Texaco station.

08:37.299 --> 08:40.667
So how you like it at Winstead's?

08:43.339 --> 08:49.744
- How do you know where I work, Roy?
- I've been here almost a week.

08:50.680 --> 08:55.674
And you've been following me
around for a week?

08:56.352 --> 08:58.650
How did you find me?

08:59.889 --> 09:01.754
You like that rifle, Toby?

09:01.924 --> 09:06.020
It's the best present ever. I love it.
I'll go pretend I'm shooting.

09:06.195 --> 09:09.528
Don't point it at anybody
or I won't teach you to shoot.

09:09.699 --> 09:12.930
- It's not loaded.
- You heard me. Anything or anybody.

09:13.102 --> 09:16.196
- It's got no bullets.
- Don't make me say it again.

09:16.372 --> 09:19.933
Fine. I'll just go point it
at the sky then.

09:25.748 --> 09:27.272
Don't.

09:28.217 --> 09:29.912
Roy, don't!

09:30.086 --> 09:33.351
Don't, Roy. Toby's still awake.

09:45.401 --> 09:47.562
You are one sweet thing, baby.

09:48.371 --> 09:53.331
It's just the sight of you
makes my dick hard.

09:58.247 --> 10:00.340
Don't, Roy.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.541
Don't, now.

10:02.718 --> 10:05.744
He's not going to hear anything!

10:14.830 --> 10:16.695
Look, I'm...

10:18.901 --> 10:20.994
Sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

10:22.204 --> 10:25.332
Come on, you know I didn't mean that.

10:28.244 --> 10:30.838
I'm just so glad to see you.

11:24.467 --> 11:27.732
<i>Most afternoons,</i>
<i>I'd wander around in a trance.</i>

11:27.903 --> 11:30.963
<i>Sometimes I'd go downtown,</i>
<i>stare at the merchandise.</i>

11:31.140 --> 11:34.632
<i>Maybe I'd shoplift. Maybe not.</i>

11:36.312 --> 11:39.577
<i>I used to imagine I saw my father</i>
<i>coming toward me.</i>

11:40.149 --> 11:43.016
<i>I'd wait for him to recognize me.</i>

11:43.486 --> 11:47.616
<i>I knew it wasn't him. He lived</i>
<i>back East, married to a rich woman.</i>

11:47.790 --> 11:51.123
<i>His nickname was Duke</i>
<i>and that's how I thought of him...</i>

11:51.293 --> 11:54.592
<i>... as a duke living in a castle</i>
<i>far away.</i>

11:56.966 --> 12:00.265
<i>A few minutes later,</i>
<i>I'd pick someone else.</i>

12:05.941 --> 12:08.068
- I'm home.
- Hi, honey.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.301
- We going someplace?
- We sure are.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.538
- Where?
- I don't know. Any ideas?

12:12.715 --> 12:15.946
- Phoenix.
- Good. I was thinking Phoenix.

12:16.118 --> 12:19.383
Or Seattle. Plenty of opportunities
in both places.

12:19.555 --> 12:23.423
What about your fabulous boyfriend?
The fabulous, boring Roy.

12:23.592 --> 12:26.356
- Is he coming too?
- God, I hope not.

12:26.529 --> 12:31.159
I looked out the window at work today,
he was across the street watching.

12:31.333 --> 12:35.292
- So uncool.
- You didn't think so last night.

12:35.471 --> 12:39.931
"I just love my new rifle, Roy!
It's the bestest present I ever had."

12:40.109 --> 12:41.701
Shut up.

12:46.782 --> 12:48.272
There.

12:48.451 --> 12:50.749
Now? We're leaving now?

12:50.920 --> 12:52.911
- What about the food?
- Leave it.

12:53.088 --> 12:57.218
- Even the canned stuff?
- Are you coming or staying?

13:06.569 --> 13:09.629
Ask him when the next one
to Phoenix is.

13:09.805 --> 13:14.970
- When's the next bus to Phoenix?
- Tomorrow morning. 11:45.

13:15.144 --> 13:18.136
- How about Seattle?
- Yeah, what about Seattle?

13:18.314 --> 13:22.842
Leaves in, what, three...
No, two minutes.

13:24.186 --> 13:27.178
- Is this the bus to Seattle?
- Yes, it is.

13:27.356 --> 13:31.122
Hurry. Come on.
Seattle, here we go!

13:32.394 --> 13:34.988
I always had a good head for figures.

13:35.164 --> 13:39.931
If I got a CPA license, I bet we could
make a real go of it in Seattle.

13:40.102 --> 13:45.870
I know what.
I'll advertise for roommates.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.222
- Hey, Ter.
- Hey, Jack.

14:36.158 --> 14:38.752
What did your mom say
about skipping school?

14:38.928 --> 14:40.623
Who listens?

14:41.664 --> 14:44.360
Did you go to Wanda's last night?

14:45.601 --> 14:47.364
You make out?

14:48.003 --> 14:49.903
Make out good?

14:51.707 --> 14:53.299
How good?

14:53.842 --> 14:56.777
Fucked her till her nose bled.

14:57.746 --> 14:59.008
Sure you did.

15:00.282 --> 15:02.273
Hey, Jack. Terry.

15:02.451 --> 15:06.353
Oh, look! It's Elvis, Elvis and Elvis.

15:06.522 --> 15:09.650
Does your face hurt?
Because it's killing me.

15:16.131 --> 15:17.621
Silver.

15:19.134 --> 15:22.126
- <i>Anybody here?</i>
- <i>Help! Help!</i>

15:22.304 --> 15:24.067
<i>Help! I'm in here!</i>

15:26.642 --> 15:31.579
Oh, well. Lois, baby, come here. I got
six hot inches just waiting for you.

15:31.880 --> 15:37.614
- Yeah, you wish.
- Oh, Lois. I want you so bad!

15:37.786 --> 15:40.653
Come on,
you make my dick hard, baby!

15:42.391 --> 15:46.794
Come on, baby. I'll do better
than Superman. Just give me a chance.

15:47.730 --> 15:49.459
<i>How did you find me?</i>

15:49.632 --> 15:54.399
Oh, Lois. Daddy-o's going to make you
happy-o. Tie them ropes around me.

15:54.570 --> 15:57.403
You couldn't even get it up, Silver.

16:01.276 --> 16:04.643
<i>We had to talk dirty for a while.</i>
<i>It was a formality...</i>

16:04.813 --> 16:09.147
<i>... like crossing yourself with holy</i>
<i>water when you went into a church.</i>

16:14.757 --> 16:17.954
<i>After that, we shut up</i>
<i>and watched the show.</i>

16:18.127 --> 16:22.723
<i>We softened. We surrendered. We watched</i>
<i>Superman have dumb adventures...</i>

16:22.898 --> 16:27.232
<i>... with dorky plots</i>
<i>and we didn't laugh at them.</i>

16:34.510 --> 16:38.970
- It looks better with the bow in back.
- He'll love it.

16:39.148 --> 16:41.708
You say he's getting serious already?

16:41.884 --> 16:45.217
I think so. He keeps talking
to me about marriage.

16:45.387 --> 16:49.118
- He's dying to meet Toby.
- Three dates. You got him.

16:49.291 --> 16:52.556
- I'm not sure I want him.
- Don't want who?

16:52.728 --> 16:56.323
It's the tough guy
who can't be bothered to go to school.

16:56.498 --> 16:57.760
Don't want who?

16:57.933 --> 17:00.527
Dwight. Remember?
I told you about him.

17:00.703 --> 17:02.762
Please, use a glass.

17:03.605 --> 17:07.540
He's that guy that comes
from the boondocks? The mechanic?

17:07.710 --> 17:10.338
Dwight. What a stupid name.

17:12.681 --> 17:14.580
Dwight.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.894
- Caroline.
- Hello?

17:28.130 --> 17:29.358
Hi.

17:29.531 --> 17:31.795
- The door was open.
- Behave.

17:33.368 --> 17:35.131
Thank you.

17:37.339 --> 17:40.866
Introduce you to everybody.
I'll take your hat.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.312
- This is Marian.
- Marian.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.508
- And Kathy.
- Kathy.

17:49.685 --> 17:52.745
And this is my son.

17:52.921 --> 17:55.549
- So you're Toby?
- No.

17:57.126 --> 17:58.616
- You're not Toby?
- No.

17:58.794 --> 18:03.390
He wants to be called Jack. Silly,
but he read those Jack London books.

18:03.732 --> 18:08.066
I'll call him anything he wants. People
can call me anything they want...

18:08.237 --> 18:12.333
...as long as they don't call me
late for supper.

18:14.309 --> 18:18.905
- A cup of coffee before we go?
- I could stand a cup of java, yeah.

18:19.248 --> 18:22.046
- Have a seat.
- Over here?

18:31.226 --> 18:33.660
- So, Jack, do you like school?
- No.

18:33.829 --> 18:35.694
- You don't like school?
- No.

18:35.864 --> 18:40.767
- That's the way it is with kids today.
- He might like it if he ever went.

18:40.936 --> 18:43.734
Have another cookie.
Keep your strength up.

18:43.906 --> 18:47.842
My son's decided to try to drive me
to an early grave. Truly.

18:48.010 --> 18:51.070
Straighten up
and be polite now, honey.

18:53.749 --> 18:56.240
- Who made this?
- I did.

18:56.418 --> 19:00.047
Well, all I can say is, you people
are pretty lucky...

19:00.222 --> 19:04.124
...to live in a house
with a cup of coffee like this.

19:04.493 --> 19:06.188
Wait.

19:20.108 --> 19:21.700
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:21.877 --> 19:25.176
Just a little trick I learned
in the Navy.

19:33.689 --> 19:38.786
So, Jack, I hear you're invited up
to Dwight's next week for Thanksgiving.

19:38.961 --> 19:43.830
You'll love it. Great air, great water.
And for scenery, just step outside...

19:43.999 --> 19:45.557
...and open your eyes.

19:45.734 --> 19:50.671
And there's a turkey shoot
Thanksgiving Day. I signed you up.

19:51.373 --> 19:54.137
- Really? Can I bring my Winchester?
- Sure.

19:54.309 --> 19:56.470
- I'll get that turkey.
- You might.

19:56.645 --> 20:01.241
Look, it can sit up and talk
just like a normal human being.

20:01.717 --> 20:04.515
Come on, Dwight.
We're going to be late.

20:08.824 --> 20:11.452
Thank you. Thank you.

20:13.161 --> 20:17.393
Here's your hat.
Not too much television now.

20:17.566 --> 20:20.535
Jack. Ladies.

20:23.672 --> 20:26.402
I love a man who knows how to dress.

20:26.575 --> 20:30.671
- He's so appealing.
- What a dope.

20:46.762 --> 20:49.230
Okay, come on.

21:13.021 --> 21:16.889
- I'll make a muslin for you.
- You will?

21:17.626 --> 21:21.221
Drag a lot of dirt up the aisle
with a train, you know.

21:23.732 --> 21:25.222
Please.

21:27.002 --> 21:28.697
Allow me.

21:29.204 --> 21:33.971
There you go. Just a little trick
I learned in the Navy.

21:34.142 --> 21:38.943
- He wasn't that bad.
- Let me try this.

21:41.416 --> 21:43.941
Who made this? Did you make this?

21:44.119 --> 21:48.021
I'd love to live in a house
with a cup of java like that.

21:48.190 --> 21:49.782
You do.

21:51.026 --> 21:52.584
- You need a light?
- Yes.

21:52.761 --> 21:55.889
There you go. Kids today, I tell you.

21:56.798 --> 22:01.531
- Are you through?
- I do believe I am through.

22:03.372 --> 22:07.741
- Be polite to Dwight this weekend.
- Okay.

22:07.909 --> 22:11.470
- I mean it.
- I said, okay, didn't I?

22:11.646 --> 22:13.876
He's gone to a lot of trouble.

22:14.049 --> 22:18.179
And you never know, I mean,
Concrete might be fun.

22:21.089 --> 22:23.751
Concrete, my favorite town.

22:23.925 --> 22:27.383
- Welcome to beautiful Concrete.
- Please stop that.

22:28.130 --> 22:29.757
Stop what?

22:40.275 --> 22:43.403
Please try to be nice, okay?

22:44.813 --> 22:47.543
- All right.
- Thank you.

22:58.493 --> 23:00.984
The air is like wine up at my place.

23:01.163 --> 23:05.031
I wouldn't live anywhere else.
That's the God's honest truth.

23:05.267 --> 23:10.432
There's good schools, honest people
and the finest fishing in the world.

23:11.740 --> 23:17.235
There's hunting too. I don't flatter
myself, but I'm a whiz with a rifle...

23:17.412 --> 23:20.108
...and Concrete allows me
to prove that.

23:20.282 --> 23:23.740
<i>Dwight kept babbling on</i>
<i>about the virtues of Concrete...</i>

23:23.919 --> 23:27.446
<i>... but all I could think about</i>
<i>was shooting that turkey.</i>

23:30.826 --> 23:34.353
Here we are. Welcome to Concrete,
my home sweet home.

23:34.529 --> 23:40.195
Some of the finest people in the whole
state of Washington. That's no lie.

23:43.972 --> 23:46.566
Lots of churches too.
Lots of churches.

23:46.741 --> 23:50.040
A neighbor says, "Looking for
nice churches, go to Concrete.

23:50.212 --> 23:52.407
Looking for sin, go to hell."

23:52.581 --> 23:56.142
I think that's funny, don't you? Jack?

23:56.451 --> 23:58.919
Toby? Jack, that is. Jack?

24:21.309 --> 24:24.608
Kids, this is my friend Caroline Wolff
and her boy, Jack.

24:24.779 --> 24:26.337
- Hi, I'm Norma.
- Hi.

24:26.515 --> 24:28.881
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.518
Skipper, Norma, and my baby, Pearl.

24:31.686 --> 24:32.948
- Hello.
- Hi.

24:33.121 --> 24:35.419
- Hello, Pearl.
- Hi.

24:36.224 --> 24:38.692
- Let's go in, look at the house.
- Sure.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.332
This is the house.

24:46.434 --> 24:48.902
This is the living room.

24:49.070 --> 24:54.474
And over here
is the dining room and piano.

24:58.413 --> 25:01.143
And this is the kitchen, over here.

25:01.316 --> 25:05.946
I plan on getting all new fixtures,
and that stuff will all be taken out.

25:06.121 --> 25:08.715
It'll be much bigger and nicer.

25:13.895 --> 25:18.423
And up here are the three bedrooms
and the bath.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.431
Plenty of room.

25:21.403 --> 25:23.564
And this is...

25:23.738 --> 25:26.536
This is a kind of a lounging area.

25:26.708 --> 25:29.541
You know, just in case you want to...

25:31.746 --> 25:33.270
...Iounge.

25:34.849 --> 25:38.376
- Over there is where I work. Joe.
- Dwight.

25:38.553 --> 25:42.319
- How about you kids? You like it here?
- It's fine.

25:42.490 --> 25:43.548
- Hi, John.
- Hi.

25:43.725 --> 25:47.320
- It's a little isolated.
- It's not that isolated.

25:47.495 --> 25:50.658
It's not that isolated.
Pretty isolated, though.

25:50.832 --> 25:53.733
There's plenty to do
if you'd take the initiative.

25:53.902 --> 25:58.032
When I was young, we didn't have TV.
We used our imagination.

25:58.206 --> 26:03.234
We read the classics, played musical
instruments. A bored kid is a lazy kid.

26:03.411 --> 26:07.177
- What musical instrument do you play?
- Sax. Tenor sax.

26:07.349 --> 26:09.749
- Let me do that.
- Thank you.

26:14.789 --> 26:17.314
- Thank you.
- You're quite welcome.

26:17.492 --> 26:22.361
- What about the schools? How are they?
- There isn't one. We go to Chinook.

26:22.530 --> 26:24.998
- Chinook High.
- A few miles downriver.

26:25.166 --> 26:28.158
- Forty miles.
- Come on, it's not that far.

26:28.336 --> 26:30.236
I clocked it. It's 39 miles.

26:30.405 --> 26:33.033
- Come on, just stow it. Stow it.
- It is.

26:33.208 --> 26:36.769
You'd bellyache if the school
was in your backyard.

26:36.945 --> 26:40.278
Now just shut your goddamn pie-hole!

26:46.388 --> 26:49.118
So how big is this turkey going to be?

26:49.291 --> 26:53.785
- "Turkey shoot" is a figure of speech.
- So there's no real turkey?

26:53.962 --> 26:58.092
It's just regulation paper targets.
It's a test of skill.

26:58.266 --> 27:04.102
And I just found out yesterday, Jack,
they won't let kids shoot.

27:05.073 --> 27:07.473
- You said I could.
- I know.

27:07.642 --> 27:10.839
- It's not fair. You said that I could.
- I know...

27:11.012 --> 27:14.641
...but they got it screwed up
and told me wrong at first.

27:14.816 --> 27:17.876
- You did tell him.
- I don't make the rules.

27:18.053 --> 27:22.820
If I made the rules, I might make
different ones. But I don't make them.

27:22.991 --> 27:26.552
Okay. That's okay, honey.

27:28.029 --> 27:31.055
Don't worry. You can watch.

27:47.716 --> 27:50.981
- Why ain't you gonna get to shoot?
- Shut up.

27:51.720 --> 27:54.848
<i>Next shooters, on your marks.</i>

27:57.892 --> 27:59.484
- Is that it?
- There you go.

27:59.661 --> 28:02.391
- Okay, good luck.
- Thanks, John.

28:02.797 --> 28:05.459
Wolff, please. Caroline Wolff.

28:05.633 --> 28:08.397
You mean you want to enter too?

28:08.570 --> 28:10.561
I think it's against the rules.

28:10.739 --> 28:14.573
That sign says this is an NRA club,
and I'm an NRA member.

28:14.976 --> 28:19.436
That allows me to participate
in the activities of other chapters.

28:23.284 --> 28:25.411
- You'll be the only woman.
- Fine.

28:25.587 --> 28:26.849
There you go.

28:27.021 --> 28:30.218
- I got it. I got it.
- Thank you.

28:30.492 --> 28:32.790
Always a first time for everything.

28:43.171 --> 28:46.766
- Eighty-four!
- <i>Eighty</i>- <i>four.</i>

28:49.477 --> 28:50.501
<i>Dwight Hansen.</i>

28:50.678 --> 28:53.010
- Good luck, dear.
- You can do it, Dad.

28:53.181 --> 28:57.777
Dwight! Get on up there, buddy.

29:08.730 --> 29:11.255
Come on, Dwight. Show us your stuff.

29:37.992 --> 29:39.550
Twenty-four!

29:40.895 --> 29:45.696
<i>Twenty</i>- <i>four, Dwight Hansen.</i>

29:48.470 --> 29:50.836
- Nice.
- I could have done better.

29:51.039 --> 29:54.839
- <i>Caroline Wolff.</i>
- Oh, yeah!

30:04.219 --> 30:07.052
Mama, shake that thing!

30:33.014 --> 30:34.948
Ninety-three!

30:36.084 --> 30:37.881
<i>Ninety</i>- <i>three.</i>

30:38.052 --> 30:43.820
<i>Ninety</i>- <i>three for Caroline Wolff.</i>
<i>Congratulations, Miss Wolff.</i>

30:45.793 --> 30:48.193
- That was real good.
- Thank you.

30:48.363 --> 30:51.423
- Where did you learn to shoot?
- Beginner's luck.

30:51.599 --> 30:56.730
Wasn't she good? Wasn't she good, kids?
I'm really impressed.

30:57.772 --> 31:02.106
My gun, bolt's not working.
It's the third gun I've bought.

31:02.277 --> 31:06.213
It just won't work right.
Fucking thing.

31:06.381 --> 31:08.110
That was really good.

31:14.756 --> 31:17.316
- What gives?
- Mom won the turkey shoot.

31:17.492 --> 31:22.429
Oh, God. Now we're in for it. Dad
thinks he's some kind of big hunter.

31:22.597 --> 31:27.193
- Well, he killed a deer once.
- That was with the car, Pearl.

31:41.249 --> 31:44.343
Could you pass the salt
and pepper, Pearl?

31:53.928 --> 31:56.021
I got just one thing to say.

31:57.699 --> 32:02.432
I'm sitting at the table
with the best damn shot in the county.

32:03.404 --> 32:05.531
You should have seen her.

32:05.707 --> 32:09.108
- Almost got every one of them.
- I missed two.

32:28.129 --> 32:29.756
He's good.

32:33.935 --> 32:36.062
Yeah, Toby! Jack.

32:36.871 --> 32:39.101
You should do that.

32:50.685 --> 32:53.153
Good, Toby! Jack. Sorry. Jack.

32:53.321 --> 32:56.449
I know, not Toby. Jack.

33:34.996 --> 33:39.228
I blew it off, man.
I blew this fucking turkey's head off.

33:39.801 --> 33:43.396
- With a.22?
- Fucking-A. Winchester.22, pump.

33:43.571 --> 33:46.233
Wolff, you are so full of shit.

33:46.407 --> 33:49.137
Don't believe me. See if I care.

33:49.744 --> 33:52.838
A.22 bullet would only make
a hole in his head.

33:53.014 --> 33:56.814
Yeah, one bullet, maybe.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.519
Oh, I see.

34:00.688 --> 34:03.919
So you hit the turkey
more than once...

34:04.092 --> 34:07.892
...while he was flying, in the head.

34:10.063 --> 34:11.964
Fuck you.

34:12.433 --> 34:14.333
Fuck you too.

34:17.839 --> 34:22.799
Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you, man!

34:25.813 --> 34:27.371
What did he do?

34:27.547 --> 34:30.984
He violated school property
and he flouted the law.

34:31.284 --> 34:34.311
Can you say that in English, please?

34:35.056 --> 34:37.616
He wrote obscene words on the wall.

34:37.792 --> 34:39.487
Did you do it?

34:39.659 --> 34:43.289
- He didn't do it.
- He wrote obscene words on the wall.

34:44.098 --> 34:46.225
What obscene words?

34:48.302 --> 34:49.735
"Fuck you."

34:51.505 --> 34:54.065
That's one obscene word.

34:55.143 --> 34:59.603
Look, Mrs. Wolff,
Jack's teachers like him...

34:59.781 --> 35:03.911
...but they feel he's fallen in
with the wrong kind of friends.

35:04.085 --> 35:07.543
Is that nicotine stains
on your fingers?

35:08.122 --> 35:10.056
I hope not.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.419
Well, back to the point.

35:15.129 --> 35:17.359
I think two weeks suspension.

35:49.964 --> 35:53.365
- So, what do we do?
- What do you mean?

35:54.101 --> 35:57.468
I mean, what shall we do?
Because this isn't working.

35:57.638 --> 36:00.869
We barely have any money.
Kathy's moving out now.

36:01.042 --> 36:03.977
- And you've gone wild. You lie.
- No, I don't.

36:04.145 --> 36:05.442
Yes, you do.

36:05.613 --> 36:09.049
You're smoking
and stealing from Marian's purse.

36:09.217 --> 36:13.244
I can't handle it anymore.
It scares me. I don't know what to do.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.389
So you tell me.

36:17.491 --> 36:21.860
I can be better. And I will be.

36:25.066 --> 36:29.662
I hate the way I am.
I don't know why I do it.

36:35.643 --> 36:38.635
I talked to Dwight the other day.

36:39.914 --> 36:44.180
After Christmas he wants you
to go to Concrete and live with him.

36:44.352 --> 36:46.616
Go to school up there.

36:47.021 --> 36:49.819
What are you gonna do,
give me away to him?

36:51.192 --> 36:55.492
Well, if you two get along
and things work out, I...

36:56.797 --> 36:59.265
He and I might get married.

37:05.072 --> 37:07.768
I don't know what else to do.

37:08.542 --> 37:10.601
You have to tell me it's okay.

37:17.685 --> 37:19.414
All right.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.617
Just think of it
like an adventure. Okay?

37:31.899 --> 37:36.802
I put in both sweaters. Be sure you
wear them. It's chilly there at night.

37:36.971 --> 37:38.598
Okay, I will.

37:50.918 --> 37:53.512
You don't have to go
if you don't want.

37:53.688 --> 37:56.589
It's not too late to change your mind.

37:56.757 --> 37:59.351
It's okay. I'll go.

38:02.463 --> 38:05.432
Here I am, you lucky people.

39:16.103 --> 39:17.536
Sorry.

39:54.842 --> 39:56.434
I'm sick to my stomach.

39:56.610 --> 39:59.977
Sick to your stomach?
A hotshot like you?

40:00.147 --> 40:03.014
- I'm not a hotshot.
- That's what I hear.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.842
I hear you're a real hotshot.

40:06.921 --> 40:10.823
Go where you want,
do what you want.

40:11.926 --> 40:13.621
Isn't that right?

40:14.962 --> 40:18.420
A regular man about town,
a performer too. Right?

40:18.599 --> 40:20.396
You a performer?

40:21.268 --> 40:23.327
I hear you do me.

40:25.539 --> 40:28.303
I hear you're real good at doing me.

40:28.476 --> 40:31.138
- Is that right?
- No, sir.

40:31.312 --> 40:33.803
That's a goddamn lie.

40:34.782 --> 40:39.515
If there's one thing I can't stomach,
it's a liar, Jack.

40:41.489 --> 40:44.617
- I'm not a liar.
- Sure, you are. You or Marian.

40:44.792 --> 40:50.526
Is Marian a liar? She says you're quite
the little performer. Is that a lie?

40:50.698 --> 40:55.931
Tell me that's a lie and we'll go back
so you can call her a liar to her face.

40:56.103 --> 40:58.367
You want me to do that?

40:59.773 --> 41:03.368
Did you hear what I said?
You want me to do that?

41:05.746 --> 41:09.409
- No.
- Then you must be the liar, right?

41:09.750 --> 41:11.308
And you're a performer?

41:13.220 --> 41:15.381
Let's see your act.

41:15.589 --> 41:19.320
Go on, do your act.
Come on, let's see your act.

41:20.261 --> 41:22.422
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

41:23.264 --> 41:24.458
Here.

41:24.999 --> 41:26.660
Do me with the lighter.

41:26.834 --> 41:30.395
Go on, take it.
Take it, hotshot.

41:30.671 --> 41:31.660
Take it.

41:34.508 --> 41:37.477
Go on, take it. Take it!

41:39.580 --> 41:42.140
You pull that hotshot stuff
around me...

41:42.316 --> 41:44.750
...and I'll break every bone
in your body.

41:44.919 --> 41:48.116
Do you understand?
I'll pop your head like a zit.

41:48.289 --> 41:50.280
You're in for a change.

41:50.457 --> 41:55.827
You're in for a whole other
ball game, buddy. Oh, yeah.

42:11.745 --> 42:14.942
So you'll be
in Miss Graham's class, right?

42:15.115 --> 42:19.882
- Yeah. Is she nice?
- She's okay. She's pretty.

42:20.054 --> 42:24.650
- I hate changing schools.
- I've never. I've been here all my life.

42:24.825 --> 42:29.159
Speaking of changing, I had a talk
with Jack on the way up here...

42:29.330 --> 42:31.525
...and he wants to be a better boy.

42:32.199 --> 42:34.463
Things weren't going well in Seattle.

42:34.635 --> 42:39.197
The police came to his house
and talked with Caroline about him.

42:39.373 --> 42:42.069
That's right. The police.

42:44.345 --> 42:48.145
- Idle hands are the devil's workshop.
- Criminal.

42:48.649 --> 42:51.948
So I found our Jack
a little something to do.

42:52.119 --> 42:55.486
I picked up two barrels
of horse chestnuts in the park...

42:55.656 --> 42:58.386
...and you can hull them
in the evenings.

42:59.560 --> 43:02.723
I also enrolled you in the Boy Scouts.

43:03.130 --> 43:08.796
And I got you a paper route.
Starts every Monday, from 3 to 6:30.

43:08.969 --> 43:13.372
Every afternoon, 3 to 6:30.
Pays 55 bucks a month.

43:13.540 --> 43:15.633
What do you say?

43:18.012 --> 43:19.502
I'll do it.

43:24.118 --> 43:27.918
- I wanna be better.
- That's what I like to hear.

43:33.260 --> 43:37.560
Okay, let's get this place cleaned up.
Let's get the dishes going.

43:37.731 --> 43:40.427
Let's show Jack
how we do it in Concrete.

43:41.935 --> 43:45.234
Jack? Let's go. Come on.

44:46.967 --> 44:48.832
<i>I don't believe that crap.</i>

44:49.002 --> 44:53.439
<i>I believe there is such a thing</i>
<i>as a bad boy. Bad clear through.</i>

44:53.607 --> 44:58.067
<i>It's gonna be my job to turn you</i>
<i>around, to set you straight.</i>

44:58.245 --> 45:03.205
<i>That's right, to kill or cure.</i>
<i>Kill or cure.</i>

45:03.384 --> 45:07.047
<i>Caroline told me about your rich daddy</i>
<i>and prep</i>- <i>school brother.</i>

45:07.221 --> 45:11.089
<i>Your fancy days are over.</i>
<i>You're a Concrete boy now.</i>

45:44.858 --> 45:48.089
I'm going to get you a Scout uniform.

45:48.395 --> 45:49.384
Really?

45:49.563 --> 45:52.794
One for me too.
Don't believe in doing things halfway.

45:52.966 --> 45:55.400
- Lf you're serious about the Scouts...
- I am.

45:55.569 --> 45:58.367
Then do it right.
We'll do it right together.

45:58.539 --> 46:02.100
I got you a subscription.
I'll take it out of your route money.

46:02.743 --> 46:04.210
<i>Boys' Magazine</i> ?

46:05.179 --> 46:08.808
It's the Scout magazine.
It tells what it means to be a Scout.

46:08.982 --> 46:13.578
What kind of boy you need to be
and about merit badges and stuff.

46:13.754 --> 46:16.188
"Suggested Good Turns a Scout Can Do:

46:16.356 --> 46:20.690
Assist a foreign boy with English.
Help put out a burning field.

46:20.861 --> 46:24.228
Give water to a crippled dog."
I could do those.

46:24.398 --> 46:29.859
Hell, yes. You're a bright kid and
I want this Scout thing done right.

46:30.771 --> 46:34.366
- I'm not going!
- The hell you say.

46:34.541 --> 46:38.875
I'm not! This is Skipper's
and it doesn't fit. I'm staying home.

46:39.046 --> 46:43.642
You're gonna shit and fall back in it,
that's all. Now get out here.

46:43.817 --> 46:44.806
Look.

46:47.855 --> 46:51.313
Shut your pie-hole.
You look fine.

46:51.692 --> 46:54.661
- I look like an idiot.
- You act like an idiot.

46:54.828 --> 46:56.887
You said you'd get me a new one.

46:57.064 --> 47:01.592
I said I'd try to get you a new one.
Besides, this one is new to you.

47:01.768 --> 47:05.260
- The sleeves hang down.
- All you do is piss and moan.

47:05.439 --> 47:08.670
Piss and moan!
You're all jazzed up in new stuff.

47:08.842 --> 47:11.402
They didn't have secondhand in my size.

47:11.578 --> 47:13.910
Pull the other leg, it's got bells.

47:14.081 --> 47:17.710
Will you tell Caroline
that you wouldn't join the Scouts...

47:17.885 --> 47:23.152
...because him didn't like
his little uniform? Okay.

47:24.591 --> 47:27.185
I wanna show you something.

47:27.861 --> 47:29.795
"Words for Thought:

47:29.963 --> 47:34.491
No boy, given over to dissipation
or negativity, can stand the gaff.

47:34.668 --> 47:37.068
He quickly tires and gives up.

47:37.237 --> 47:41.367
He is the type who usually
lacks courage at the crucial moment.

47:41.542 --> 47:44.739
He cannot take punishment
and come back smiling."

47:44.912 --> 47:46.174
Anybody we know?

47:49.449 --> 47:51.178
Hotshot?

47:51.652 --> 47:53.813
Anybody we know?

47:54.187 --> 47:57.350
- Fine, but this stinks.
- Hotshot.

47:57.524 --> 48:00.186
Me and Concrete are in your blood.

48:00.360 --> 48:03.693
We'll make a man of you.
In years, you'll thank me.

48:03.864 --> 48:07.800
You'll remember me.
Me and Concrete. Right?

48:07.968 --> 48:09.993
- How do I look?
- You look fine.

48:12.039 --> 48:13.870
Fire.

48:15.142 --> 48:17.110
Food.

48:18.946 --> 48:21.005
Rapids.

48:23.050 --> 48:25.211
Want.

48:27.087 --> 48:29.214
People.

48:31.058 --> 48:33.151
Twinkle.

48:35.295 --> 48:37.456
Father.

48:41.735 --> 48:43.202
<i>We are gathered together...</i>

48:43.470 --> 48:44.562
...in the sight of God...

48:44.738 --> 48:47.639
...to join together this man
and this woman...

48:47.808 --> 48:50.299
...in the state of holy matrimony.

48:50.477 --> 48:56.074
It is an honorable estate, instituted
of God and signifying unto us...

48:56.249 --> 49:01.186
...the mystical union which exists
between Christ and his church.

49:01.355 --> 49:04.688
It is, therefore, not to be
entered into lightly...

49:04.858 --> 49:10.592
...but reverently, discreetly,
and in fear of God.

50:04.885 --> 50:08.013
Honey, let's not do it
this way tonight.

50:08.188 --> 50:12.147
- It's good this way.
- I know, but I want to see your face.

50:13.493 --> 50:16.428
No. I don't like that way.

50:16.830 --> 50:19.264
You don't like to do it face to face?

50:19.433 --> 50:22.664
I don't like that way.
I don't like to see the face.

50:24.037 --> 50:25.504
- You mean, never?
- No.

50:25.672 --> 50:28.197
- But that's crazy.
- Look!

50:28.408 --> 50:32.003
You can get it doggie-style
or laying on your side.

50:32.179 --> 50:35.239
This is my house and I get to say.
Got it?

50:35.682 --> 50:37.343
Sorry.

52:33.166 --> 52:34.861
Want some?

52:36.136 --> 52:38.798
- Some what?
- Coffee.

52:39.472 --> 52:40.837
No.

52:46.046 --> 52:49.504
- Happy wedding breakfast.
- Good morning.

52:49.683 --> 52:51.617
- Jack.
- Good morning, Daddy.

52:51.785 --> 52:54.515
- Where's the paper?
- It's by the toaster.

52:54.688 --> 52:56.713
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

52:58.291 --> 53:02.227
- So how is the bride this morning?
- Don't.

53:02.395 --> 53:05.626
- The bride doesn't wanna chat.
- That's enough.

53:05.799 --> 53:08.632
The bride sure is snotty this morning.

53:08.802 --> 53:12.238
So, Jack, how are you feeling
this morning?

53:12.405 --> 53:14.100
I'm okay.

53:16.142 --> 53:19.703
- So did you have fun last night?
- You bet we did.

53:21.615 --> 53:23.139
Good.

53:23.516 --> 53:25.643
She's good enough, man.

53:26.286 --> 53:29.619
- She wanted to, but I didn't want to.
- You said no?

53:29.789 --> 53:31.051
You guys are sick.

53:32.058 --> 53:33.616
I'm sorry.

53:34.961 --> 53:36.895
Look who's coming.

53:37.864 --> 53:39.991
- Who's that?
- Arthur Gayle.

53:40.166 --> 53:42.100
What a homo.

53:42.302 --> 53:44.395
- He walks like a girl.
- Yeah.

53:44.571 --> 53:47.563
Runs like one, talks like one,
throws like one.

53:48.008 --> 53:52.138
And probably takes a pee like one too.
Just squats right down.

53:52.979 --> 53:56.813
He mouthed off to me the other day.
I was gonna sock him.

53:56.983 --> 54:00.146
He called me a bourgeois.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.754
- What's a bourgeois?
- I don't know.

54:04.157 --> 54:05.818
Call him a homo.

54:05.992 --> 54:08.859
- Why?
- Just see what he says.

54:11.731 --> 54:16.794
My, my. What do we have here?
Elmer Fudd and his hunting boys.

54:18.805 --> 54:20.932
Look at all that yellow.

54:21.207 --> 54:24.734
Didn't your mama teach you
to wash your hands after you pee?

54:25.979 --> 54:27.173
Shut up.

54:27.347 --> 54:31.977
Strike one. That was very good.
Very original.

54:32.152 --> 54:36.145
Did you just make that up?
That was very, very clever.

54:37.891 --> 54:40.951
Why don't you just fuck off,
dick-lick?

54:41.127 --> 54:43.357
Excuse me!

54:46.333 --> 54:51.236
Has anyone told you you look exactly
like a pile of steaming dog turd?

54:52.105 --> 54:57.304
Yeah? Well, at least
I'm not a great, big homo.

55:00.981 --> 55:02.608
Come on.

55:02.816 --> 55:05.182
Get him. Come on, get him!

55:08.254 --> 55:09.653
Take him, Jack.

55:10.190 --> 55:11.987
Come on, take him out!

55:14.094 --> 55:15.527
Asshole!

55:19.766 --> 55:21.859
Fucking asshole!

55:23.136 --> 55:24.694
Come on!

55:27.907 --> 55:30.137
Get him. Get him!

55:31.945 --> 55:33.742
Kick his ass, Jack.

55:48.995 --> 55:53.159
Get up, son of a bitch!
You stink of dog shit! Get up.

55:53.333 --> 55:55.028
I'll kill you!

55:58.538 --> 56:00.335
Take it back.

56:02.375 --> 56:04.468
Take it back!

56:05.412 --> 56:08.711
- Okay.
- Say it.

56:10.417 --> 56:12.476
- I take it back.
- No.

56:12.652 --> 56:14.847
Say, "You're not a homo."

56:19.993 --> 56:22.427
You're not a homo.

56:26.966 --> 56:28.695
Come on, Pepper.

56:41.277 --> 56:44.906
Well. So!

56:45.348 --> 56:47.282
Who won?

56:48.985 --> 56:51.010
He can't see out of one eye.

56:51.187 --> 56:57.126
Hot damn! You actually gave
Little Lord Gayle a black eye?

56:57.293 --> 57:00.626
- Yeah. It's not black yet.
- But it's all puffed up?

57:00.797 --> 57:03.960
Then it's a shiner, right? Right?

57:04.600 --> 57:06.591
How'd it start?

57:07.303 --> 57:08.895
I called him a sissy.

57:09.072 --> 57:13.099
He can't sue you for slander.
He fights for the pink team.

57:13.276 --> 57:16.177
Goddamn kid's queer.
Did you make him cry?

57:17.580 --> 57:19.775
Yeah. He was ready to.

57:19.949 --> 57:23.180
I called him a big-ass
squat-to-pee sissy.

57:23.352 --> 57:25.684
I'd have won bigger,
but he hit when I wasn't looking.

57:25.855 --> 57:29.416
He dry-gulched you?
Wait a minute. That's your fault.

57:29.592 --> 57:33.460
There's no excuse for getting
dry-gulched. You got me?

57:33.629 --> 57:35.824
I'm gonna show you a few moves...

57:35.998 --> 57:40.094
...that'll leave Miss Gayle
wondering what month it is. Okay?

57:40.269 --> 57:42.703
I said to this kid,
"Stop doing that."

57:42.872 --> 57:48.003
He said, "What business is it to you?"
I said, "I don't think it's right."

57:48.177 --> 57:51.408
He said, "What will you do?"
I said, "Something."

57:51.581 --> 57:56.917
He said, "You and who else?" I said,
"The three of us: Me, myself and I."

57:57.086 --> 58:00.681
After school, he's waiting for me.
He yells something.

58:00.857 --> 58:06.887
People like that, you gotta hurt them
or they'll never leave you alone.

58:07.063 --> 58:09.531
So it was real hot out. Okay?

58:10.066 --> 58:13.433
There were horse turds
laying all over the place.

58:13.603 --> 58:17.801
I picked up a big, mushy one
and go up to him, not acting tough.

58:17.974 --> 58:21.603
Acting more like,
"I'm so scared. Please don't hurt me."

58:21.778 --> 58:26.715
Minding my business. And I say to him,
"Excuse me. What's the problem?"

58:26.883 --> 58:29.511
And he goes...

58:29.685 --> 58:32.415
I go...
I jam that turd in his fat mouth.

58:32.588 --> 58:36.684
Then I sucker punch him.
He goes down, and I kick his face...

58:36.859 --> 58:40.317
...jump on his head, then
I jam another turd down his throat...

58:40.496 --> 58:42.930
...kick his fucking teeth
a couple times.

58:43.099 --> 58:48.594
And that was the end. Never bothered
me again, that piece of shit.

58:53.109 --> 58:55.475
Just a little tale.

58:56.312 --> 58:59.076
You're getting it.
That's it. Good hit.

58:59.682 --> 59:00.979
Try for my face.

59:01.250 --> 59:03.741
That's it.
Keep yourself in the fight.

59:04.287 --> 59:07.188
Keep it open. Open.
That's it. Wide open.

59:08.624 --> 59:10.489
One, two, three, four!

59:12.562 --> 59:14.962
This is nothing
compared to what you'll get.

59:15.131 --> 59:18.532
Keep that guard up.
When you go like that, bring it back.

59:18.701 --> 59:20.794
Keep your guard up!
Try the jab.

59:20.970 --> 59:22.631
- I am.
- Try it. Come on.

59:24.207 --> 59:26.767
Want me to call you
Miss Jackie Wolff?

59:26.943 --> 59:31.846
Oh, my. Go, Jackie.
Jackie! Jackie.

59:32.248 --> 59:35.615
<i>What about the honeymoon night?</i>
<i>Dwight seems so shy.</i>

59:35.785 --> 59:41.314
- No, I wouldn't say he was shy, no.
- <i>Come on, Caroline. Fill me in.</i>

59:41.490 --> 59:44.084
We're still getting to know
each other.

59:44.260 --> 59:47.195
<i>Okay. So how's Jack doing?</i>

59:47.363 --> 59:48.955
You're not trying.

59:49.131 --> 59:53.659
- <i>Are him and Dwight getting along okay?</i>
- They're like father and son.

59:53.836 --> 59:57.966
<i>Really? That's just great.</i>
<i>Caroline, are you okay?</i>

59:58.140 --> 01:00:02.042
I'm fine. Things are just fine.

01:00:04.046 --> 01:00:08.244
You said you were going to teach me
how to dry-gulch somebody.

01:00:08.417 --> 01:00:09.475
Okay.

01:00:09.652 --> 01:00:13.918
You can always kick somebody
in the balls. But this one's better.

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:19.357
What you do is hit them in the throat
with the side of your forearm, like that.

01:00:19.528 --> 01:00:20.688
You wait until...

01:00:21.631 --> 01:00:23.531
Now that's dry-gulching.

01:00:23.699 --> 01:00:27.692
Hit them in the throat,
but do it before they expect it.

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:30.737
You got that?
Before they're expecting...

01:00:31.374 --> 01:00:33.433
You got that? Now you try it.

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:35.905
- Come on, you try it.
- No.

01:00:36.078 --> 01:00:38.569
- Don't be afraid.
- No, you'll hurt me.

01:00:38.748 --> 01:00:41.148
- Just try it.
- No.

01:00:41.317 --> 01:00:45.583
Try it. I'll hurt you
if you don't do it. Come on!

01:00:45.755 --> 01:00:48.155
Come on.
Let's go, goddamn it!

01:00:48.324 --> 01:00:52.351
Let's start, you little
fucking sissy all your goddamn life.

01:00:52.528 --> 01:00:56.294
Quitter! Gonna be a goddamn quitter?
Let's go! Damn you.

01:00:56.465 --> 01:01:02.028
Don't go shy. You're acting as sissy as
Little Miss Arthur Gayle, you know that?

01:01:02.204 --> 01:01:05.571
I'm gonna call you
Little Miss Jackie Wolff.

01:01:06.275 --> 01:01:11.042
My, yes. Oh, Jackie.
My, yes. Little Miss Jackie Wolff.

01:01:11.213 --> 01:01:13.704
Is that what you want me to call you?

01:01:13.883 --> 01:01:17.979
Is that what you want the kids
to call you? Jackie Wolff?

01:01:18.154 --> 01:01:21.180
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Let's do it.

01:01:21.357 --> 01:01:24.087
Jesus Christ,
if you're gonna act like...

01:01:29.765 --> 01:01:32.427
You just about
got dry-gulched, mister.

01:01:36.238 --> 01:01:39.105
Ask him again, please.
I need it so much.

01:01:39.275 --> 01:01:43.803
I asked him already. I asked him
last week. I asked him this morning.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.675
He wants you to keep the route.

01:01:45.848 --> 01:01:50.979
Then make him give me the money.
It's mine, and I earned it. It's $220.

01:01:51.153 --> 01:01:54.748
He won't. He wants to keep it
until you really need it.

01:01:54.924 --> 01:01:59.554
It's not fair! I ought to be able
to keep my own money.

01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:01.860
But it's mine, Mom!

01:02:05.301 --> 01:02:07.064
Ask him about my gym shoes.

01:02:07.236 --> 01:02:10.364
I can practice barefoot.
For games, I need them.

01:02:10.539 --> 01:02:13.997
I won't do it, Jack.
I won't be a referee.

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:19.777
The bride won't argue.
The bride won't even raise her voice.

01:02:19.949 --> 01:02:21.849
I'll tell you what she'll do.

01:02:22.018 --> 01:02:26.580
The bride will go over there and
slap the hell out of the bride's son.

01:02:26.756 --> 01:02:29.589
Does the bride's son
want his face slapped?

01:02:29.892 --> 01:02:34.192
I hate it here, you know that?
I wanna just get up and go.

01:02:34.363 --> 01:02:39.391
I don't have another get-up-and-go
left in me. Do you understand that?

01:02:39.568 --> 01:02:43.664
I can't run anymore.
I've hit a brick wall here.

01:02:44.774 --> 01:02:50.178
This whole thing isn't perfect for me
either. Let me impress that on you.

01:02:50.346 --> 01:02:54.248
I don't exactly wake up singing
every morning.

01:02:56.052 --> 01:03:01.854
I know you don't believe me now,
but it's the best thing.

01:03:02.158 --> 01:03:03.989
Okay?

01:03:10.099 --> 01:03:14.331
I'm gonna make this marriage work.
I won't join in any fights.

01:03:14.503 --> 01:03:16.801
I won't even raise my voice.

01:03:22.445 --> 01:03:24.777
You see these?

01:03:24.947 --> 01:03:28.439
He picked them for me last night
on his way home.

01:03:28.617 --> 01:03:29.948
Big deal.

01:03:31.954 --> 01:03:34.980
I'm trying to concentrate
on the good stuff.

01:03:38.761 --> 01:03:40.661
What do you think?

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:44.356
I think I look like a fool.
But who cares?

01:03:44.533 --> 01:03:48.435
Six weeks to graduation
and California here I come.

01:03:56.712 --> 01:03:59.943
You have to try and concentrate
on the good stuff.

01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:02.511
Come on.

01:05:04.813 --> 01:05:07.145
You like my dog?

01:05:14.023 --> 01:05:18.790
- Yeah, he's nice.
- He's smart too. He can talk.

01:05:21.764 --> 01:05:24.130
Sure, I just about believe you.

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.825
Pepper, what's on a tree?

01:05:27.703 --> 01:05:29.068
Bark.

01:05:30.172 --> 01:05:33.198
I wanna ask you,
how's the world treating you?

01:05:34.076 --> 01:05:36.010
Rough?

01:05:36.478 --> 01:05:38.742
I know how you mean.

01:05:39.448 --> 01:05:42.781
That's dumb.
A little funny, though.

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:51.689
How come your dad
never comes to meetings?

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:55.557
I don't have a dad.
I never did.

01:05:56.131 --> 01:05:59.589
I sprang full-blown
from my mother's imagination.

01:06:02.738 --> 01:06:05.400
Wanna walk home with me and Pepper?

01:06:09.445 --> 01:06:12.573
I knew I'd like you,
because you're an alien.

01:06:12.748 --> 01:06:14.841
An alien?

01:06:15.384 --> 01:06:20.117
You and I don't belong in Concrete.
This place would like to kill us.

01:06:20.289 --> 01:06:22.655
Come on, that's a little dramatic.

01:06:22.825 --> 01:06:25.157
- You think so?
- Yeah.

01:06:25.327 --> 01:06:28.854
Do you know what chickens do
when one chicken's different?

01:06:29.031 --> 01:06:31.591
With black feathers on its head, say?

01:06:31.767 --> 01:06:34.634
They peck at that black spot
until the chicken's dead.

01:06:34.803 --> 01:06:37.397
They can't stand that it's different.

01:06:37.573 --> 01:06:42.533
We're both different. Your difference
is something other than my difference.

01:06:42.711 --> 01:06:45.145
But we're both aliens here.

01:06:45.314 --> 01:06:50.047
See, I don't exactly feel like an alien.
I've got friends, you know.

01:06:50.219 --> 01:06:54.747
They're idiots. You act like an idiot
when you're around them.

01:06:55.124 --> 01:06:56.716
A prediction:

01:06:56.892 --> 01:07:00.760
If you stay in Concrete,
you'll wind up working at the A & P.

01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:04.831
Either that, or you'll go on a rampage
with a hunting rifle.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.529
And you'll wind up a recluse who
likes to dress in his mama's old clothes.

01:07:10.706 --> 01:07:11.832
Maybe.

01:07:12.007 --> 01:07:13.736
Maybe.

01:07:14.743 --> 01:07:16.540
One thing I know...

01:07:16.712 --> 01:07:19.340
...no matter how many times I repeat...

01:07:19.515 --> 01:07:22.279
...my primary goal
is to get out of Concrete.

01:07:22.451 --> 01:07:24.385
Burma-Shave!

01:08:25.346 --> 01:08:27.281
<i>Thank you, Joe Feeney.</i>

01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:31.475
<i>And here's a happy tune that features</i>
<i>our happy Norwegian.</i>

01:08:31.653 --> 01:08:33.245
<i>"The Laughing Polka. "</i>

01:08:34.022 --> 01:08:37.617
See, honey? You gotta try
and find the good stuff.

01:08:37.893 --> 01:08:40.417
You're a hog.
Don't tell me you're not.

01:08:40.595 --> 01:08:43.258
How do you know Skipper
didn't do it, or Norma?

01:08:43.432 --> 01:08:47.162
- I told them to stay away from this candy.
- How do you know I ate any?

01:08:47.336 --> 01:08:50.737
I counted them. You hogged down
11 chocolates since yesterday.

01:08:50.906 --> 01:08:51.895
So what?

01:08:52.073 --> 01:08:55.942
That makes you a hog!
I just wanna establish that fact.

01:08:56.111 --> 01:09:00.810
Mr. Hotshot Hog and I have
just been establishing some facts:

01:09:00.983 --> 01:09:05.352
One, he's a pig who gobbles down candy.
Two, he lies about it.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:09.651
Three, he lays around on his candy-ass,
day and night, reading.

01:09:09.825 --> 01:09:14.956
And four, he's not getting $ 10 gym
shoes. That's what we've come up with.

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:16.426
Dad, just lay off.

01:09:16.598 --> 01:09:19.965
Don't give me that shit!
Shut your goddamn pie-hole.

01:09:20.135 --> 01:09:21.658
Why don't you take up for me?

01:09:21.837 --> 01:09:24.670
Why don't you help me
straighten him out?

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.300
All he ever does is read or listen
to music or sing. I'm sick of it.

01:09:29.478 --> 01:09:32.743
"Blue Monday."
I'm so sick of that shit!

01:09:32.915 --> 01:09:36.442
When he's not singing, he's watching
TV. Don't say you don't.

01:09:36.618 --> 01:09:40.384
When I come home,
I feel the TV to see if it's warm...

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:45.926
...and it always is. This is the news.
I want you to know I'm wise to you.

01:09:46.094 --> 01:09:48.961
Big deal!
I don't wanna do my paper route.

01:09:49.131 --> 01:09:53.795
I bet you don't. You'd rather
lay on your ass and read all day.

01:09:53.969 --> 01:09:59.202
You're going to deliver those papers if
I have to walk behind you with a whip.

01:09:59.374 --> 01:10:02.207
Yeah? Then give me the money
that I earned.

01:10:02.377 --> 01:10:05.312
I'm putting it in the bank
for when you need it.

01:10:05.481 --> 01:10:08.541
- You'll thank me later.
- Make him buy gym shoes.

01:10:08.717 --> 01:10:12.153
How can I play basketball
without any gym...?

01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:20.327
It's not the shoes, is it?
Or the candy, or anything else.

01:10:20.496 --> 01:10:23.727
It's me. You can't stand
the fact that I exist.

01:10:23.899 --> 01:10:27.562
No, it's not that at all.
It's just that I...

01:10:27.736 --> 01:10:31.604
You have to be well-behaved.
Your rich daddy doesn't care.

01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:35.072
Somebody's gotta train you.
You need to be trained...

01:10:35.244 --> 01:10:39.738
...not to be a fucking hog
and hog everybody's candy!

01:10:42.384 --> 01:10:47.344
- What's the matter?
- I will not referee!

01:10:48.524 --> 01:10:54.292
I think you've upset your mother, so
let's go to the Scouts and let her rest.

01:10:54.463 --> 01:10:57.523
Honey, you just lay down
and rest a while.

01:10:58.333 --> 01:11:00.062
Now look what you did.

01:11:00.235 --> 01:11:02.135
Got her upset too.

01:11:15.751 --> 01:11:20.916
Check for the tongue tonight, otherwise
you won't get your lifesaving badge.

01:12:44.539 --> 01:12:47.372
Whose dog is that on the porch?

01:12:47.609 --> 01:12:48.906
Yours.

01:12:49.544 --> 01:12:52.172
- Mine?
- Yeah, you said you wanted a dog.

01:12:52.347 --> 01:12:56.943
- A collie. Not that thing.
- Well, he's yours. You paid for him.

01:12:57.352 --> 01:13:01.516
- Get ready for Norma's play.
- What do you mean, I paid for him?

01:13:16.838 --> 01:13:18.669
My Winchester's gone!

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:23.334
That dog's purebred English bulldog.
A champion. Don't forget that.

01:13:23.512 --> 01:13:24.843
I don't want it!

01:13:25.013 --> 01:13:28.039
You're out of luck.
That rifle's in Seattle.

01:13:28.216 --> 01:13:29.808
I want my rifle!

01:13:29.985 --> 01:13:32.545
Want in one hand and
shit in the other.

01:13:32.721 --> 01:13:34.348
That Winchester was mine!

01:13:34.523 --> 01:13:39.620
Champ is your dog. I trade some piece
of crap for a valuable hunting dog...

01:13:39.795 --> 01:13:43.993
...and all you do is piss and moan.
- I'm not pissing and moaning.

01:13:44.166 --> 01:13:48.796
The hell you aren't! You can just make
your own deals from now on.

01:13:53.008 --> 01:13:56.774
<i>I said, don't ever touch me again,</i>
<i>because...</i>

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:01.777
<i>... I'm absolutely finished.</i>
<i>This is the end.</i>

01:14:02.684 --> 01:14:04.379
<i>I want you to get out!</i>

01:14:04.553 --> 01:14:08.284
<i>This impassioned testimony helped sway</i>
<i>the jury to acquit...</i>

01:14:08.457 --> 01:14:12.154
<i>... Cheryl Crane of the murder</i>
<i>of Johnny Stompanato...</i>

01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:15.888
<i>... boyfriend of Cheryl's mother,</i>
<i>film star Lana Turner.</i>

01:14:16.064 --> 01:14:20.558
<i>The jury returned a verdict</i>
<i>of justifiable homicide...</i>

01:14:20.736 --> 01:14:24.536
<i>... allowing Cheryl to go free</i>
<i>for the killing of Stompanato.</i>

01:14:24.706 --> 01:14:29.405
<i>The stabbing occurred during an</i>
<i>argument, when Cheryl grabbed a knife...</i>

01:14:29.578 --> 01:14:35.778
<i>... said to her mother, "You don't have to</i>
<i>take that!" and stabbed Stompanato.</i>

01:14:35.951 --> 01:14:38.511
<i>His threatening behavior</i>
<i>was a factor...</i>

01:14:38.687 --> 01:14:41.918
<i>... in the jury's verdict</i>
<i>of justifiable homicide.</i>

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:46.720
<i>A violent final chapter in this affair</i>
<i>ends in the famous pink bedroom...</i>

01:14:46.895 --> 01:14:49.455
<i>... of Lana Turner's</i>
<i>Beverly Hills mansion.</i>

01:17:03.265 --> 01:17:06.325
- Hello.
- That your car in the ditch back there?

01:17:06.501 --> 01:17:08.366
- Yeah.
- How did it get there?

01:17:08.837 --> 01:17:13.797
- It's hard to explain.
- Get in then, we'll have to tow it.

01:17:24.252 --> 01:17:29.155
Hey. Anybody home?

01:17:29.324 --> 01:17:32.760
Your mom said you were sick.
Feeling better?

01:17:32.928 --> 01:17:34.555
Yeah.

01:17:35.063 --> 01:17:37.224
Get some sleep, did you?

01:17:38.033 --> 01:17:41.264
- About four hours.
- Well, you must have needed it.

01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:44.865
Good.

01:17:46.241 --> 01:17:48.573
Oh, by the way...

01:17:48.743 --> 01:17:53.180
...you didn't hear a funny
pinging noise in the engine, did you?

01:17:53.348 --> 01:17:56.749
God, look at me. I gotta shave.
I look terrible.

01:17:56.918 --> 01:17:59.478
- What engine?
- I was downtown with Champ...

01:17:59.654 --> 01:18:04.455
...and I met a guy who recognized him.
Said he'd seen my dog this morning.

01:18:04.626 --> 01:18:07.527
He told me a story
how he and the dog met.

01:18:07.696 --> 01:18:10.597
I thought you'd like to hear about it.

01:18:11.399 --> 01:18:13.458
What do you think about that?

01:18:14.436 --> 01:18:17.303
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:18:23.578 --> 01:18:26.308
Dwight! Stop!

01:18:26.848 --> 01:18:30.545
You steal my car?
You steal my car?

01:18:30.719 --> 01:18:33.415
- Stop!
- Don't you steal my car!

01:18:33.822 --> 01:18:35.619
Stop! Don't!

01:18:48.303 --> 01:18:53.070
Only me on this whole earth
to straighten you out.

01:18:53.241 --> 01:18:57.905
And I'll do it. Kill or cure.
Kill or cure.

01:19:01.316 --> 01:19:04.410
Now get your ass up.
You're going to school.

01:20:02.444 --> 01:20:03.570
Come on, Jack.

01:20:03.745 --> 01:20:05.713
Hurry up.

01:20:07.782 --> 01:20:10.751
Come on, Wolff. Move it.

01:20:37.545 --> 01:20:39.911
<i>A lot can happen in two years.</i>

01:20:40.081 --> 01:20:43.244
<i>Skipper and Norma had left</i>
<i>and moved to Seattle.</i>

01:20:43.418 --> 01:20:45.386
<i>I was gonna get out too.</i>

01:20:45.553 --> 01:20:49.250
<i>But in the meantime</i>
<i>I made some new friends.</i>

01:20:50.592 --> 01:20:53.459
- Gorilla blood.
- Psycho, shut up.

01:20:53.628 --> 01:20:56.961
- Fuck you.
- Hey, look, there goes Carol Baumgarten.

01:20:57.132 --> 01:21:00.829
- Ain't she sweet? She's hot for Wolff.
- Yeah, I wish.

01:21:01.035 --> 01:21:04.402
Won't do her any good.
He's saving himself for Rhea.

01:21:04.572 --> 01:21:05.869
- Know what?
- Fuck off.

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.908
He said even the inside of her arm
turns him on. Her arm.

01:21:10.078 --> 01:21:12.945
You slay me, Wolff.
She is pretty, though.

01:21:13.548 --> 01:21:16.676
I'd sure like to eat
Rhea Clark's pussy.

01:21:16.851 --> 01:21:19.615
- Give it a rest.
- No, I mean it. I mean it.

01:21:20.321 --> 01:21:23.381
I'd like to get down
and really grovel on it.

01:21:23.558 --> 01:21:26.584
Spend about a week
with my face right in it.

01:21:54.722 --> 01:21:57.919
<i>Meeting newsmen,</i>
<i>Mr. Truman pledges to support...</i>

01:21:58.092 --> 01:22:03.155
- <i>... John F. Kennedy for president.</i>
- <i>I ask your help in this campaign.</i>

01:22:06.968 --> 01:22:11.632
It's good news, they say that Truman's
gonna campaign for Kennedy.

01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:15.740
I gave $25 to his office today.

01:22:16.444 --> 01:22:21.541
- I was thinking, I could go work...
- Here I am, you lucky people.

01:22:30.091 --> 01:22:33.060
The SOB had been on my back
for a week at work...

01:22:33.228 --> 01:22:37.358
...saying I stole his wrench
and poured oil all over his tools.

01:22:37.532 --> 01:22:40.695
Well, he went one step too far
with old Dwight.

01:22:40.868 --> 01:22:44.326
He spat on the floor as I went by.
I walked back to him...

01:22:44.505 --> 01:22:48.373
...acting dainty, humble and scared.
Then he took his eyes off me.

01:22:48.543 --> 01:22:51.239
I dry-gulched that son of a bitch.

01:22:51.412 --> 01:22:56.349
He never gave me another second's
grief, and that was five years ago.

01:22:56.918 --> 01:23:00.945
Yeah, come here. Come on.
Come here, Champ.

01:23:01.122 --> 01:23:03.215
Come here. Come on. Thattaboy.

01:23:03.391 --> 01:23:07.452
I heard Mr. Kennedy
on the news again tonight.

01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:11.190
I don't know. It seems that
every once in a while...

01:23:11.366 --> 01:23:16.861
...somebody comes along who
doesn't seem like he's such a liar.

01:23:18.039 --> 01:23:23.204
- Kennedy, the senator from Rome.
- He gives me hope.

01:23:23.378 --> 01:23:27.007
I know what he gives you
and it sure as hell isn't hope.

01:23:27.181 --> 01:23:30.582
You're right there.
He is very attractive.

01:23:30.752 --> 01:23:34.552
He does have pearly-white teeth.
I don't think that's it.

01:23:34.722 --> 01:23:37.748
Come on, boy. Attaboy.

01:23:41.029 --> 01:23:47.161
- I'm gonna go work for the campaign.
- No, that's a bad idea. Bad idea.

01:23:47.335 --> 01:23:51.362
Too many Republicans in town.
They hear you work for Democrats...

01:23:51.539 --> 01:23:55.270
...they'll take their cars
someplace else to be fixed.

01:23:55.443 --> 01:23:59.209
Right, boy? Right, my little baby boy?
Come to Daddy.

01:24:01.182 --> 01:24:06.313
Oh, Ricky. Please let me come down
and work for you at the club.

01:24:07.055 --> 01:24:08.386
What are you doing?

01:24:08.556 --> 01:24:09.614
- Champ.
- Get away.

01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:11.156
Champ!

01:24:11.459 --> 01:24:16.089
- Champ. Sit. Sit.
- Treat me like Lucy, I'll act like her.

01:24:16.264 --> 01:24:19.791
I'm working for the Kennedy's campaign.
Are you through?

01:24:20.134 --> 01:24:23.001
- You're not working for them.
- We'll see.

01:24:23.171 --> 01:24:27.437
You're not working for the campaign!
Get that through your head.

01:24:27.608 --> 01:24:31.510
- You're not.
- There's no reason on earth why I can't.

01:24:31.679 --> 01:24:35.046
There is every reason in the world.
I just told you.

01:24:35.216 --> 01:24:38.879
- You can count on it. I'll do it.
- What?

01:24:39.053 --> 01:24:40.953
- Count on it.
- I told you why.

01:24:46.094 --> 01:24:48.153
I'll be through in a minute.

01:24:53.401 --> 01:24:56.996
You left the lid
off the damn toothpaste again.

01:24:57.171 --> 01:25:00.231
Dwight, is that the best
you can come up with?

01:25:00.775 --> 01:25:05.337
This is my house, and I get to say
about the toothpaste. You got that?

01:25:05.513 --> 01:25:09.847
Huh? Have you? Huh?

01:25:10.017 --> 01:25:15.080
If you lived with your dad, Duke, and his
rich wife, things might be different.

01:25:15.256 --> 01:25:20.819
But he's not here now, is he? Is he?
Oh, Duke. Duke, are you here?

01:25:20.995 --> 01:25:24.795
Duke? Dukie? Are you here?

01:25:24.966 --> 01:25:27.901
Oh, how sad. Duke's not here.
Oh, boo-hoo.

01:25:28.069 --> 01:25:32.802
My house. My bathroom. I get to say
about the toothpaste. You got that?

01:25:37.011 --> 01:25:40.777
Come on. Come on. Give me an excuse.
Come on.

01:26:11.179 --> 01:26:13.875
- Hey.
- You didn't pick this up yesterday.

01:26:14.048 --> 01:26:17.540
- You got nothing higher than a C.
- Shut up.

01:26:21.055 --> 01:26:24.024
- <i>Voilá</i>.
- You're gonna get caught someday.

01:26:24.192 --> 01:26:27.218
Oh, I'm so scared. Really.

01:26:27.395 --> 01:26:31.422
You act more like those morons
you hang around with every day.

01:26:31.599 --> 01:26:36.593
- I'm Psycho. I'm retarded.
- He hears you do that, you're dead.

01:26:39.273 --> 01:26:44.176
- Let me copy your math homework.
- No. But I'll show you how to do it.

01:26:45.246 --> 01:26:50.684
I tell you I'm thirsty and you offer me
a sandwich. Thank you and fuck you.

01:26:52.286 --> 01:26:56.985
I take it back. You don't act like Psycho,
you act like Dwight.

01:27:02.296 --> 01:27:06.392
I know it.
He's winning, isn't he?

01:27:07.969 --> 01:27:12.065
I do act like him
and I feel like him sometimes.

01:27:12.406 --> 01:27:15.398
I've gotta get out of this place
or I'm dead.

01:27:15.576 --> 01:27:18.943
- You've said that for two years.
- This time I mean it.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.040
I'll live with Gregory in Princeton.

01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:25.141
The brother who never calls?

01:27:25.319 --> 01:27:28.948
- That brother?
- I may go to a prep school like he did.

01:27:29.123 --> 01:27:31.489
- Like my dad.
- What about your grades?

01:27:31.659 --> 01:27:35.117
- What about money?
- Dwight owes me over $ 1200.

01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:38.660
If he hadn't kept my paper route money
I'd be okay.

01:27:38.833 --> 01:27:43.099
If the dog hadn't stopped to pee,
he would have caught the rabbit.

01:27:47.241 --> 01:27:51.007
You know what?
I think Dwight was right about you.

01:27:51.178 --> 01:27:54.306
I think you do fight for the pink team.

01:28:03.724 --> 01:28:06.158
<i>My brother and I had been in touch.</i>

01:28:06.594 --> 01:28:10.587
<i>He said the road from Concrete</i>
<i>to Princeton starts with SATs.</i>

01:28:10.765 --> 01:28:14.963
<i>And that I could take them</i>
<i>at the Lakeside School in Seattle.</i>

01:28:15.136 --> 01:28:17.661
<i>Dwight said I had</i>
<i>as much chance of passing...</i>

01:28:17.838 --> 01:28:22.002
<i>... as he had of farting his way through</i>
<i>the "Star</i>- <i>Spangled Banner. "</i>

01:28:54.041 --> 01:28:57.807
Hi, honey. Would you take
that trash out for me, please?

01:29:04.485 --> 01:29:06.282
Thank you.

01:29:32.747 --> 01:29:36.683
My application forms came today,
and he threw them away.

01:29:36.851 --> 01:29:40.218
I thought I was helping.
I'd save him some trouble.

01:29:40.388 --> 01:29:44.017
He's got no chance of getting into
some fancy prep school.

01:29:44.225 --> 01:29:47.490
Your nose is always pressed
against the bakeshop window.

01:29:47.662 --> 01:29:49.926
- What?
- You're afraid that someone...

01:29:50.097 --> 01:29:53.692
...is gonna get what you never had.
It makes you mean.

01:29:53.868 --> 01:29:55.096
You know something?

01:29:55.269 --> 01:29:59.603
One day that meanness will snap back
and slap you in the face.

01:29:59.774 --> 01:30:04.177
Oh, I'm so scared. I'm so scared.
I'm so scared!

01:30:06.013 --> 01:30:09.176
This is all you gave me for dinner?

01:30:18.392 --> 01:30:22.021
<i>When I went to fill out applications,</i>
<i>I ran into a wall.</i>

01:30:22.196 --> 01:30:25.563
<i>They wanted letters of recommendation</i>
<i>from teachers.</i>

01:30:25.733 --> 01:30:27.530
<i>I could write these myself.</i>

01:30:27.702 --> 01:30:32.071
<i>But they wanted my grades on</i>
<i>our official school transcript forms.</i>

01:30:32.239 --> 01:30:35.208
- <i>And this was a problem.</i>
- I won't do it.

01:30:35.376 --> 01:30:38.106
You work in the office.
No one will know.

01:30:38.279 --> 01:30:41.339
I'm surprised you
want help from the pink team.

01:30:41.515 --> 01:30:45.849
I'm asking you for help. I heard
I did really well on those tests.

01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.183
But it's not enough.
I've got to cheat and lie.

01:30:49.356 --> 01:30:52.086
If they want A's,
I have to give them to them.

01:30:52.259 --> 01:30:55.023
- It's so simple. You're the only way I...
- No!

01:30:58.466 --> 01:31:01.492
Why should you get to be
the one who leaves?

01:31:03.437 --> 01:31:05.428
Why not me?

01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:48.080
You could leave too, you know.

01:31:48.249 --> 01:31:52.879
No. I've grown progressively fond
of Concrete.

01:31:53.053 --> 01:31:58.423
I think I'll stay here all alone and
dress up in my mama's old clothes.

01:31:58.592 --> 01:32:02.119
You know, like you said.

01:32:28.722 --> 01:32:32.214
Excuse me. I need some help here.
Fuck!

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:30.715
Jack! Jack, you got letters
from those schools!

01:34:17.932 --> 01:34:21.868
Hey, Wolff!
Bring that bottle over here.

01:34:22.036 --> 01:34:26.063
Brand new,
with a nice shine and everything.

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.574
Bullshit. Nobody in your family's
ever been in a Corvette.

01:34:30.744 --> 01:34:32.905
- But you're going to own one?
- Yeah.

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.878
- Go pick it up.
- I'm gonna move to Seattle.

01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:39.884
I'll get a job at Bendix
and drive to work in my Vette.

01:34:40.054 --> 01:34:44.047
My uncle can have any car.
Makes big bucks as an electrician.

01:34:44.224 --> 01:34:46.852
- Yeah, how big?
- $ 175 a week, take home.

01:34:47.027 --> 01:34:50.087
- Bullshitter.
- Even supervisors don't make that.

01:34:50.264 --> 01:34:53.927
Then how are you gonna
make enough to drive a Vette?

01:34:54.768 --> 01:34:57.669
- I'll drive a T-Bird.
- I'm gonna own a Vette...

01:34:57.938 --> 01:35:00.702
...even if I have to rob
the Bendix payroll.

01:35:00.874 --> 01:35:03.468
You losers. Bunch of losers.

01:35:03.644 --> 01:35:08.013
- Who you calling a loser?
- Jackie called us losers.

01:35:11.986 --> 01:35:13.647
All of you!

01:35:17.825 --> 01:35:21.591
You're gonna drive a Fairlane,
just like your daddy does.

01:35:21.895 --> 01:35:24.261
Tell me something, Psycho. Tell me.

01:35:24.431 --> 01:35:29.232
How you gonna drive a T-Bird if you're
a janitor like your entire family?

01:35:29.403 --> 01:35:34.204
Forget about being an electrician.
You can't even pass 10th-grade math.

01:35:34.608 --> 01:35:39.238
- Who died and made you King Shit?
- Yeah. You're no better than us.

01:35:40.347 --> 01:35:42.474
I know, that's my point, Psycho.

01:35:44.018 --> 01:35:46.418
You guys are my buddies.

01:35:47.755 --> 01:35:50.724
You guys are my pals.

01:35:55.896 --> 01:35:59.798
My dear old dad's called Dwight.

01:36:01.769 --> 01:36:06.331
Welcome to beautiful Concrete.

01:36:36.437 --> 01:36:40.931
We only take boys who want to work.
Is that you?

01:36:41.575 --> 01:36:44.066
I want you to start evenings now.

01:36:44.244 --> 01:36:49.739
And I'd want you to work all summer.
No vacations.

01:36:50.084 --> 01:36:52.416
Food-service work isn't easy.

01:36:52.586 --> 01:36:55.680
It doesn't come to you
in a year or two.

01:36:55.956 --> 01:37:00.655
So, you think you got what it takes
to be an A & P management trainee?

01:37:01.161 --> 01:37:03.994
Yeah, it's exactly what I've got.

01:37:06.033 --> 01:37:08.968
- Now, where did this...?
- I got another one.

01:37:09.136 --> 01:37:12.162
You're gonna finish this puzzle.

01:37:12.339 --> 01:37:17.777
Look. See this one? See this house?
So it's got to go with the house.

01:37:18.145 --> 01:37:20.705
I got the top together.

01:37:20.881 --> 01:37:23.372
Excellent. You're very good at this.

01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:29.386
You're gonna finish this entire puzzle
and I have only put in one piece.

01:37:29.556 --> 01:37:32.286
I got it. Found it.

01:37:32.459 --> 01:37:35.326
No, right here. Look, I got it.

01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:39.331
Carla and Skipper are the best.

01:37:45.339 --> 01:37:48.274
- Hi, I'm home.
- Hi, sweetheart.

01:37:48.442 --> 01:37:50.501
You're late. We started dinner.

01:37:50.677 --> 01:37:53.009
- Sorry.
- We had to go ahead and eat.

01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:57.207
- Give me a second, I'll get your dinner.
- I'll get some at work.

01:37:57.384 --> 01:38:01.013
I don't want you to go to work
on an empty stomach.

01:38:01.188 --> 01:38:04.419
- I'm in a rush, sorry.
- There's a plate in the oven.

01:38:04.591 --> 01:38:07.754
- Put it on the table.
- What are these?

01:38:07.928 --> 01:38:10.692
Blueberry muffins.
I made them for you.

01:38:15.536 --> 01:38:19.267
I was trying to listen to a record.

01:38:28.715 --> 01:38:30.376
Hello?

01:38:30.551 --> 01:38:34.817
Yeah, he's here. Are you Tobias?

01:38:38.725 --> 01:38:40.488
Hello?

01:38:42.095 --> 01:38:44.063
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

01:38:44.231 --> 01:38:45.289
All right.

01:38:46.767 --> 01:38:49.827
Okay, tomorrow, then.

01:38:50.003 --> 01:38:51.698
Bye.

01:38:56.777 --> 01:38:57.869
Well?

01:39:00.314 --> 01:39:03.283
It was Hill School,
the last one I applied to.

01:39:03.450 --> 01:39:05.475
They haven't accepted me yet...

01:39:05.652 --> 01:39:08.746
...but they're sending somebody in
to interview me.

01:39:19.166 --> 01:39:22.624
I enjoy my classes,
especially the advanced ones.

01:39:22.803 --> 01:39:27.297
But lately I've been feeling restless.
It's hard to explain.

01:39:27.474 --> 01:39:33.037
Oh, come on, that's easy to explain.
You're bored. Not being challenged.

01:39:33.547 --> 01:39:38.849
Toby, your application was very good.
But many boys want to go to Hill...

01:39:39.019 --> 01:39:42.352
...and not everybody is comfortable
at prep school.

01:39:42.522 --> 01:39:46.788
I think I would. Both my father
and brother went to prep schools.

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:51.988
- Is that right? Where?
- Deerfield and Choate.

01:39:52.165 --> 01:39:56.659
I see. Well, you might like it.

01:39:56.837 --> 01:40:02.867
Hill was difficult for me, though.
Academically, it was hard.

01:40:03.043 --> 01:40:07.480
Then, my last year things changed.
My classmates grew close in ways...

01:40:07.648 --> 01:40:11.140
...I never would've thought possible.
So close that...

01:40:11.318 --> 01:40:16.051
...well, I still think of them
as sort of a second family.

01:40:16.223 --> 01:40:19.784
I want that. I do.

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:24.727
She says, "No, I don't want you to
do that." And I said, "Let me get down...

01:40:24.898 --> 01:40:29.597
...and grovel in it." I mean, I ate her
pussy till my tongue was calloused.

01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:32.461
Then, I noticed her nipples got hard.

01:40:32.639 --> 01:40:36.598
You know, not big fat nipples,
but hard raisin nipples.

01:40:36.777 --> 01:40:39.644
So she goes off like
this Roman candle.

01:40:39.813 --> 01:40:44.648
I mean, that woman can scream.
I says, "You liked that, didn't you?

01:40:45.052 --> 01:40:48.078
You like the old Arch Cook special,
don't you?"

01:40:48.555 --> 01:40:50.523
Bye, Richie.

01:40:56.296 --> 01:41:00.858
Toby, boys at Hill talk roughly too,
sometimes.

01:41:01.101 --> 01:41:04.832
I can see you've led
rather a sheltered life.

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.535
Yeah.

01:41:11.645 --> 01:41:15.911
You seem like a fine boy, and
I'm going to give you a good report.

01:41:16.083 --> 01:41:20.679
But there are lots of boys applying.
We'll just have to wait and see...

01:41:20.854 --> 01:41:25.791
Hotshot. It's the hotshot boy.

01:41:26.226 --> 01:41:29.821
Guy who thinks he knows everything,
thinks he's smart.

01:41:31.164 --> 01:41:34.793
Fella, what you don't know
would fill a book.

01:41:35.635 --> 01:41:38.399
Edsel's a shit car.

01:41:42.776 --> 01:41:45.506
He's a mechanic,
he did bad work on our car.

01:41:45.679 --> 01:41:48.807
It's just, he acts like that.
I don't know why.

01:41:49.783 --> 01:41:53.879
- Well, good luck.
- Thanks.

01:42:41.435 --> 01:42:44.768
I know what'll make you feel good.
That man called.

01:42:44.971 --> 01:42:51.433
You got the scholarship. They're gonna
give you $2300 a year. Great, huh?

01:42:52.012 --> 01:42:57.450
So I guess you'll be leaving soon.
I'm gonna miss you.

01:42:57.617 --> 01:43:04.079
I'm making hot dogs. Want one?
Can you put mustard on bread for us?

01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:26.610
Hey, what are you doing home so...?
Toby got the scholarship. $2300.

01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:32.241
Hey, leopard. I say, hey, leopard.
I know you, leopard.

01:43:32.719 --> 01:43:36.849
I can see those spots
that you can't change, leopard.

01:43:37.023 --> 01:43:41.255
Huh, leopard? Huh?

01:43:42.562 --> 01:43:46.623
He thinks he'll go to a fancy school
and fool everybody.

01:43:46.867 --> 01:43:48.994
Not a chance.

01:43:51.605 --> 01:43:54.802
I know a thing or two
about a thing or two.

01:43:55.308 --> 01:43:59.472
I sure do. Sure do.

01:43:59.646 --> 01:44:02.114
- Who threw this away?
- I did.

01:44:02.282 --> 01:44:05.547
- You threw it away? Why?
- Because it was empty.

01:44:05.719 --> 01:44:07.983
- That look empty?
- Looks empty to me.

01:44:08.154 --> 01:44:10.645
- To me too.
- Look again, hotshot.

01:44:10.824 --> 01:44:13.019
- Is it empty? Is it empty?
- Dad.

01:44:13.193 --> 01:44:16.060
- Now, now, now, is it empty?
- Stop!

01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:22.190
Now, Mr. Bigtime-Hotshot-
Prep-School-Fucker, is it empty?

01:44:22.369 --> 01:44:26.897
- Is it empty? Huh?
- No.

01:44:27.073 --> 01:44:31.567
Good. All right. Now, clean it out.

01:44:39.019 --> 01:44:40.543
Clean it out!

01:44:42.355 --> 01:44:45.620
Now, was it empty?

01:44:45.792 --> 01:44:49.387
- Huh? Was it empty?
- Yes.

01:45:37.377 --> 01:45:38.776
Come on, you fuck!

01:45:39.779 --> 01:45:41.906
Come on. Come on.

01:46:07.307 --> 01:46:08.968
Get away from him!

01:46:09.142 --> 01:46:11.610
Get away from him or I'll kill you.

01:46:15.649 --> 01:46:17.207
What's going on here?

01:46:17.384 --> 01:46:21.548
I got the scholarship and he went nuts.
He's crazy. I'm leaving!

01:46:21.721 --> 01:46:24.849
Great. Go. Finally. About time.
About time. Go.

01:46:25.025 --> 01:46:27.357
I'm gone!
Give me my paper route money.

01:46:27.594 --> 01:46:30.062
- That money is gone with the wind.
- No!

01:46:30.230 --> 01:46:31.458
I spent it.

01:46:31.798 --> 01:46:33.197
For things we needed!

01:46:33.366 --> 01:46:35.357
It's gone! Poof!

01:46:35.535 --> 01:46:38.936
Know something? It's not
that you're disappointing.

01:46:39.139 --> 01:46:44.543
- You're consistently disappointing.
- Fancy talk. Fancy talk for a whore.

01:46:44.711 --> 01:46:47.908
Yeah, I know a thing or two
about a thing or two.

01:46:48.081 --> 01:46:51.414
I got friends in this town
and they tell me things.

01:46:51.584 --> 01:46:55.782
I heard a guy at campaign headquarters
got you a job in Washington, D.C.

01:46:55.955 --> 01:46:58.924
You're gonna run off with him,
right, whore?

01:46:59.092 --> 01:47:03.392
- You're pathetic.
- Miss Whore. Liar! Whore! You know it.

01:47:03.697 --> 01:47:05.187
Mom, you can leave too.

01:47:05.365 --> 01:47:08.698
I'm leaving.
You don't have to stay for this shit!

01:47:09.769 --> 01:47:11.168
- I don't, do I?
- No.

01:47:11.337 --> 01:47:15.103
- Liar! Whore!
- I could leave with you, couldn't I?

01:47:15.275 --> 01:47:16.537
Yes, you could.

01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:19.679
- I could walk right out, couldn't I?
- Yes.

01:47:19.846 --> 01:47:21.814
- What?
- I'm leaving you, Dwight.

01:47:21.981 --> 01:47:25.348
- No. No, you're not. What about me?
- I'm leaving.

01:47:25.518 --> 01:47:27.884
- What about me?
- I'm leaving you.

01:47:28.188 --> 01:47:30.383
Why stay? You don't even like me.

01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:33.423
No, you're not leaving.
You're not leaving.

01:47:33.593 --> 01:47:35.823
Keep away from us.

01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:40.329
You always sided against me,
thought you were better.

01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:44.459
I tried. I did the best I could.
What about me?

01:47:44.671 --> 01:47:48.607
What am I supposed to do?
Crawl off in some ditch and die?

01:47:48.775 --> 01:47:50.936
What about me?

01:47:55.582 --> 01:47:59.780
What about me? What about me?

01:48:00.386 --> 01:48:05.722
When is it ever Dwight's turn
for some consideration? What about me?

01:48:08.495 --> 01:48:12.454
I'll tell you one thing,
you'll remember me!

01:48:12.665 --> 01:48:15.031
- <i>It was as easy as that.</i>
- You'll remember me!

01:48:15.201 --> 01:48:17.795
<i>We just picked up and left.</i>

01:48:18.471 --> 01:48:23.135
<i>You can dream of a moment for years and</i>
<i>still somehow miss it when it comes.</i>

01:48:23.309 --> 01:48:28.303
<i>You've got to reach through the flames</i>
<i>and take it or lose it forever.</i>

01:48:28.481 --> 01:48:30.779
<i>I took it. So did my mother.</i>

01:48:31.551 --> 01:48:33.951
<i>We never looked back.</i>

01:48:43.329 --> 01:48:46.093
I borrowed money
from everybody we know.

01:48:46.266 --> 01:48:49.531
- So here's the extra $200 for tuition.
- Thanks.

01:48:49.702 --> 01:48:54.071
There's another 50 there, get
yourself a blazer or something, okay?

01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:55.730
Okay.

01:48:58.144 --> 01:48:59.771
Well...

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:03.605
You're sure you're gonna be all right?

01:49:03.783 --> 01:49:08.447
Yeah, Mom, my bus comes in two hours.
I'll be fine.

01:49:15.228 --> 01:49:18.254
I'm going to miss you so much.

01:49:22.635 --> 01:49:24.933
Get on the bus, Mom.

01:49:31.744 --> 01:49:33.109
I love you.

01:49:36.249 --> 01:49:40.276
I know that, Mom.
I've always known that.

01:49:42.322 --> 01:49:44.153
All aboard.

01:49:49.629 --> 01:49:51.221
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

01:50:03.076 --> 01:50:05.067
<i>I love you.</i>
