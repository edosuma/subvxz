<i>What, are you kidding me?
I love Sundays. I live for Sundays.</i>

00:20.647 --> 00:24.651
<i>The whole family is together. Mom
makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on.</i>

00:24.818 --> 00:26.444
<i>We're all watching the game.</i>

00:26.611 --> 00:29.364
<i>Yeah, it drives me crazy.
And, yes, I was negative.</i>

00:29.531 --> 00:33.118
You didn't even know I loved it, Nikki.
I just didn't appreciate it or you before.

00:34.869 --> 00:37.706
Come on. Time to go.

00:38.665 --> 00:40.625
I lost all that. I blew it.

00:40.792 --> 00:43.044
But you also blew it.
We can get it back.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.922
We're gonna get it back.
It's gonna be better now.

00:46.089 --> 00:49.259
I'm better now and I hope you are too.
I'm gonna appreciate...

00:49.426 --> 00:51.136
Be there in a minute.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.805
Doctor's waiting. Let's go.

00:54.139 --> 00:56.099
I'll be there in a minute.

00:57.642 --> 01:00.353
That's true love.

01:30.967 --> 01:34.679
That's when I had long hair.
People say I talk about hair too much.

01:34.846 --> 01:37.223
It's the way I want it,
but he cut it back.

01:37.390 --> 01:40.101
He cut this side to even up.
Didn't tell him that.

01:40.268 --> 01:43.521
- I said, "Just cut the way you cut."
- - Anything's possible.

01:43.688 --> 01:47.525
I think if we get... We often get caught
in this state of negativity.

01:47.692 --> 01:49.486
It's a poison like nothing else.

02:03.416 --> 02:06.085
You can take him out
against our recommendation,

02:06.252 --> 02:09.172
but you assume liability
in the eyes of the court.

02:09.339 --> 02:11.591
And he's getting used
to the routine here.

02:11.758 --> 02:15.386
I don't want him to get used
to the routine here.

02:15.553 --> 02:17.722
Eight months
is already long enough.

02:28.608 --> 02:30.235
Hey, Mom.

02:31.778 --> 02:34.280
Can we give Danny a ride
to North Philly?

02:34.572 --> 02:35.990
What?

02:36.157 --> 02:39.661
- I don't understand.
- Oh, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.

02:39.828 --> 02:42.288
I guess everybody leaving today.

02:42.455 --> 02:45.750
Hello, Mrs S.
An honour to finally meet you.

02:45.917 --> 02:48.503
Pat told me how God made you
rich in character.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.673
You're the mighty oak
that hold the household together.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.968
And not to mention the lasagne you
make on game day when the Birds play.

03:02.684 --> 03:05.395
Danny was in for assault
because of crystal meth and alcohol.

03:05.562 --> 03:08.356
- Bad combination.
- On top of an anxiety disorder.

03:08.523 --> 03:13.194
That's when I was an x-ray technician
and I had my ADD and my anxiety.

03:13.361 --> 03:17.073
I had a lot of access to medication
and I took advantage of it.

03:17.448 --> 03:21.035
That's when my hair was long.
My hair only grew when I was older.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.454
When I was younger,
my hair didn't grow...

03:23.621 --> 03:26.374
Remember my brother had a Jheri curl
and I couldn't

03:26.541 --> 03:28.742
because my hair didn't grow long.

03:28.877 --> 03:30.461
I was jealous of my brother, but wait.

03:30.837 --> 03:32.547
- Hello?
- It looks great now.

03:32.714 --> 03:34.382
- You like it?
- It's good now.

03:34.549 --> 03:36.050
You're going the wrong way.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.886
- It's this way.
- What?

03:38.052 --> 03:40.430
Are you sure about that?

03:40.597 --> 03:42.724
I'll bring him back right away.

03:42.891 --> 03:46.936
You lied to me, Pat.
Danny's not allowed to leave.

03:47.312 --> 03:49.480
All right, Mom, let's talk about this.

03:49.647 --> 03:53.151
- Mom, just listen.
- Do not touch the steering wheel!

03:56.404 --> 04:00.116
Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.035
I'm sorry, Mom.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.913
- You OK?
- I am out on a limb for you

04:05.079 --> 04:08.791
- with the courts right now.
- It's my fault. Pat didn't know.

04:08.958 --> 04:11.502
He's my friend
so he's rooting for me.

04:11.669 --> 04:15.256
I'm having a disagreement with
the hospital. We're working it out.

04:15.423 --> 04:18.927
Take me to the hospital,
but take Pat home, he's fine. Trust me.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.803
You'll see, he's fine. It's my fault.

04:23.056 --> 04:27.685
Can we stop at the library? I wanna read
Nikki's English high school syllabus.

04:28.353 --> 04:31.773
Mom, it's a good thing.
I'm remaking myself.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.078
<i>DeSean Jackson.</i>

04:46.204 --> 04:48.831
<i>What happened to DeSean Jackson?</i>

04:48.998 --> 04:51.334
- Come on, tell me that one.
- - Insanity.

04:51.501 --> 04:55.797
He spikes the ball at the 1-yard line,
the 1-fucking-yard line. I mean, I...

04:55.964 --> 05:00.009
Get into the end zone, dummy. I mean,
he celebrates before he's even in.

05:00.176 --> 05:03.930
You know something? Nothing new.
Your team does that all the time.

05:04.097 --> 05:07.392
They get close and blow it.
They got an inferiority complex.

05:07.558 --> 05:11.145
What are you talking about? What
makes the Cowboys America's team?

05:11.312 --> 05:14.357
- Because we're America's team.
- We're in Philadelphia.

05:14.524 --> 05:18.695
- What's the matter? You're a traitor.
- What's more American than a cowboy?

05:18.861 --> 05:21.656
You know what's more American?
Benjamin Franklin.

05:21.823 --> 05:25.576
- Benjamin Franklin?
- Franklin, the founder of our country.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.787
With the glasses,
long, scraggly hair?

05:27.954 --> 05:31.207
What about the lightning?
He stood in the storm with a kite.

05:31.374 --> 05:34.836
If he wasn't on a 100 dollar
bill, nobody would know who he is.

05:35.003 --> 05:37.171
- Why do you got so many?
- - Don't touch.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.549
I didn't even touch them.
Don't blame me.

05:39.716 --> 05:42.427
Who did this?
Who took the remotes like this?

05:42.593 --> 05:45.221
- Did you do this, Randy?
- - I don't touch them.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.473
I don't know why you need so many.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.892
Hey! Ah, there she is.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.895
- Look how beautiful. Hey.
- What?

05:53.062 --> 05:54.480
- What's this?
- - Hi.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.990
- Everything good?
- - Mm-hm.

06:05.324 --> 06:06.951
Well...

06:10.246 --> 06:11.998
- Where is it?
- It's right here.

06:12.165 --> 06:13.583
You got it. Ah.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.835
Well, we don't want them
to steal that.

06:16.002 --> 06:18.713
- You still got yours?
- Yeah, I got mine.

06:20.673 --> 06:23.593
So you don't talk to me?
Didn't tell me you took him?

06:23.760 --> 06:26.971
- Well, he's ready.
- Didn't tell Dad you're picking me up?

06:27.138 --> 06:30.933
- Don't worry about that.
- I wanna make sure you're OK and I...

06:31.100 --> 06:35.354
- She didn't say anything. Didn't tell me.
- The court said yes. Don't worry.

06:35.521 --> 06:39.817
Yeah, but what did the doctor say?
Because the court listens to the doctor.

06:39.984 --> 06:43.279
- The court listens to the doctor...
- Dad, Dad, Dad, relax.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.740
The court said it's fine, OK?
Let it go.

06:45.907 --> 06:48.534
- - Don't worry.
- I'm there because of the court.

06:48.701 --> 06:52.622
That's the agreement we made.
It was a plea bargain with the courts.

06:52.789 --> 06:55.666
The lawyer instructed,
he said we should plead that,

06:55.833 --> 06:59.378
- I serve eight months and get out.
- - It's all under control.

07:01.547 --> 07:05.009
- Well, OK. OK, congratulations.
- - Thank you.

07:05.176 --> 07:08.387
- So, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna start a restaurant.

07:08.554 --> 07:11.474
- A cheesesteak place.
- - How you gonna pay for it?

07:11.641 --> 07:14.769
- - I'm gonna pay, don't worry.
- From your bookmaking?

07:15.394 --> 07:17.772
- Who told you that?
- Mom told me. Outside.

07:17.939 --> 07:20.274
- - No, I didn't.
- You just told me outside.

07:20.441 --> 07:21.943
Five minutes ago, you said:

07:22.110 --> 07:25.530
"Don't say anything, but Dad
lost his job and he's bookmaking."

07:28.157 --> 07:30.451
Why, Dolores?
Why did you say that to him?

07:30.618 --> 07:32.829
He has the wrong idea.
Everything's fine.

07:32.995 --> 07:35.581
I'm more concerned about you
than anything else.

07:35.748 --> 07:38.084
- Good, Dad, good.
OK, the question is:

07:38.251 --> 07:40.336
What are you gonna do
with yourself?

07:40.503 --> 07:42.713
I'm getting in shape.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.216
I'm getting trimmed,
getting fit for Nikki.

07:45.383 --> 07:49.679
I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching
syllabus and get my old job back.

07:53.141 --> 07:55.935
You know, she...
Nikki sold the house. She left.

07:57.145 --> 08:01.274
- Didn't your mother tell you she...?
- You don't know about my marriage.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.236
Our marriage...
We're very, very much in love, OK?

08:05.403 --> 08:07.446
Just like you two.

08:07.947 --> 08:12.910
Listen, Patrick, she's gone.
She's not around anymore. Nikki left.

08:13.077 --> 08:16.998
What are you doing, Dad?
You... Excelsior. Excelsior.

08:17.165 --> 08:19.041
- - What does that mean?
- It means

08:19.208 --> 08:21.919
I'm gonna take this negativity
and use it as fuel.

08:22.086 --> 08:25.089
I'm gonna find a silver lining.
And that's no bullshit.

08:25.256 --> 08:28.593
That's no bullshit.
That takes work and that's the truth.

09:02.752 --> 09:05.171
What the fuck? Unh!

09:08.549 --> 09:10.718
Stupid fucking book.

09:10.885 --> 09:15.306
Can't believe Nikki's teaching that book.
The whole time. Let me break it down.

09:15.473 --> 09:18.517
You're rooting for this Hemingway guy
to survive the war

09:18.684 --> 09:20.811
and to be with Catherine Barkley.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.856
It's 4.00 in the morning, Pat.

09:24.023 --> 09:27.735
And he does. He does. He survives
the war after getting blown up.

09:27.902 --> 09:30.905
Survives it and escapes to Switzerland
with Catherine.

09:31.072 --> 09:33.908
But now Catherine's pregnant.
Isn't that wonderful?

09:34.075 --> 09:36.786
They escape into the mountains.
They'll be happy,

09:36.953 --> 09:38.621
and drinking wine and dance.

09:38.788 --> 09:41.624
They both like to dance,
which was boring,

09:41.791 --> 09:44.001
but I liked it
because they were happy.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.295
You think he ends it there? No.

09:46.462 --> 09:48.089
He writes another ending.

09:48.256 --> 09:50.216
She dies, Dad.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.469
I mean, the world's hard enough
as it is, guys.

09:53.636 --> 09:57.348
Hard enough as it is. Can't somebody
say, "Hey, let's be positive?"

09:57.515 --> 09:59.934
"Let's have a good ending
to the story?"

10:01.894 --> 10:04.355
Pat, you owe us an apology.

10:04.522 --> 10:07.608
Mom, I can't apologise.
I'm not gonna apologise for this.

10:08.025 --> 10:11.529
You know what I will do? Apologise
on behalf of Ernest Hemingway

10:11.696 --> 10:13.656
because that's who's to blame here.

10:13.823 --> 10:17.201
Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us
and apologise to us too.

10:27.003 --> 10:29.797
- Why didn't you run with me, huh?
- I was reading.

10:29.964 --> 10:34.218
Do us a favour, don't read for a while.
Why are you wearing a garbage bag?

10:34.385 --> 10:36.304
- Gonna go run now.
- Wait.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.515
Where are you going?
Wait, you have to fix this window.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.726
- I'll fix it when I get back.
- Now.

10:41.892 --> 10:44.145
Get in the car.
You have to go to therapy.

10:44.312 --> 10:47.315
- I don't wanna go to therapy.
- It's part of the deal.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.483
You can't live with us and not go.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.765
Is that song really playing?

11:21.891 --> 11:23.411
We have music sometimes.

11:23.476 --> 11:25.186
That song is killing me.

11:25.353 --> 11:28.314
- Could you please turn it off?
- - I can't.

11:28.481 --> 11:30.983
- What do you mean?
- Don't have the controls.

11:31.275 --> 11:33.903
- Sorry...
- Did Dr Timbers put you up to this?

11:34.070 --> 11:37.573
Is there a speaker here?
Is the speaker here?

11:41.285 --> 11:44.789
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.500
I'll fix all this, OK?

11:54.048 --> 11:57.885
That was a messed-up thing you did,
Dr Patel. I'm sorry, but that's...

11:58.052 --> 12:00.137
- - You can call me Cliff.
- Yeah, Cliff,

12:00.304 --> 12:02.515
that's not the way
to meet people, OK?

12:02.681 --> 12:06.102
Why don't you write that in...?
I don't know, a little book?

12:06.268 --> 12:09.480
Sorry. I wanted to see
if it was still a trigger for you.

12:09.647 --> 12:11.982
Bravo, it's a trigger.

12:14.652 --> 12:16.987
- I'm not gonna take meds.
- You have to.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.365
No, I'm not gonna.
It makes me foggy...

12:19.698 --> 12:22.076
- You have to.
- I don't want to need meds.

12:22.243 --> 12:24.620
I'm sorry. Look,
I am not the explosion guy, OK?

12:27.331 --> 12:30.876
My father is the explosion guy.
I'm not that guy.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.920
He got kicked out of that stadium.

12:33.087 --> 12:35.881
He beat up people,
he's on the exclusion list.

12:36.048 --> 12:40.386
- I had one incident.
- But one incident can change a lifetime.

12:42.680 --> 12:47.268
But I'm ready. I'm ready to take
responsibility for my side of the street.

12:47.435 --> 12:50.479
- She just needs to take responsibility.
- What's hers?

12:50.646 --> 12:52.440
- What's hers?
- Mm-hm.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.024
Are you joking?

12:55.443 --> 12:57.445
Well, let's go back to the incident.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.824
I come home from work
after I left early, which I never do,

13:01.991 --> 13:04.535
but I got in a fight with Nancy,
the principal.

13:04.702 --> 13:06.954
I come home and what's playing?
The song.

13:07.121 --> 13:10.124
The song that you so charmingly played
out here for us.

13:10.291 --> 13:13.544
That's playing. I don't think
anything of it. I should have.

13:13.878 --> 13:17.756
<i>I come home, what do I see?
I walk in the door and I see underwear</i>

13:17.923 --> 13:20.176
<i>and clothing,
a guy's pants with his belt.</i>

13:20.342 --> 13:23.179
And I walk up the stairs
and I see the DVD player.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.556
<i>On the player
is the CD playing the song.</i>

13:25.723 --> 13:28.476
And then I look down
and I see my wife's panties.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.061
<i>And then I look up
and see her in the shower.</i>

13:31.228 --> 13:34.106
I think, "That's sweet.
She's in the shower. Perfect."

13:34.273 --> 13:38.110
"I'll go in. We never fuck in the shower
anymore. Maybe today we will."

13:38.277 --> 13:41.989
I pull the curtain back and there's
the fucking history teacher with tenure.

13:45.451 --> 13:47.244
And you know what he says to me?

13:48.704 --> 13:51.248
<i>"You should probably go."
That's what he says.</i>

13:52.333 --> 13:55.002
So, yeah, I snapped.
I almost beat him to death.

13:55.169 --> 13:59.924
But I get chastised for it? And I'm
parallel to my father? I don't think so.

14:00.090 --> 14:04.803
All right. Can you talk about something
that you did before or after?

14:05.721 --> 14:08.057
Week before the incident,
I called the cops

14:08.224 --> 14:11.435
and I told them my wife and the guy
were embezzling money

14:11.602 --> 14:13.854
from the local high school, which...

14:17.608 --> 14:20.152
...wasn't true. It was a delusion.

14:20.861 --> 14:24.240
And we later found out from
the hospital that's because I'm, uh...

14:25.032 --> 14:27.493
Undiagnosed bipolar.

14:28.953 --> 14:32.915
Yeah.
With mood swings and weird thinking

14:33.082 --> 14:36.794
brought on by severe stress,
which rarely happens, thank God.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.758
And the shower incident happened,
everything snapped,

14:42.925 --> 14:48.973
so I then realised that, "Oh, wow, I've
been dealing with this my whole life."

14:49.139 --> 14:51.350
And without any supervision,

14:51.517 --> 14:54.019
I've been doing it all on my own
with no help.

14:54.186 --> 14:58.107
And basically, I've been like
white-knuckling it this whole time.

14:58.399 --> 15:01.443
- That had to be hard.
- Yeah, it's a lot to deal with,

15:01.610 --> 15:06.240
especially when you don't know what
is happening, which I do now. Sort of.

15:06.407 --> 15:08.367
<i>You have to take
your medication.</i>

15:08.951 --> 15:10.953
- I can't.
- I will call them.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.200
- They'll come for you.
- - You wouldn't do that.

15:13.247 --> 15:14.767
- Why call them?
- - What's up?

15:14.832 --> 15:18.752
I don't feel good when I...
I don't feel good. I'm clear without it.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.964
Makes me bloated.
I don't like the way it makes me look.

15:22.131 --> 15:23.549
Just take the medication.

15:23.716 --> 15:27.553
I'm doing it with my physicality.
Working out, that's what I'm doing.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.681
- Why is he wearing a garbage bag?
- Why are you?

15:30.848 --> 15:32.600
- To sweat.
- - Sit down. Come on.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.686
Seven minutes in, no score.
Help turn the juju around.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.271
I don't believe in juju.

15:37.438 --> 15:40.024
Come on, you wanna be positive?
Be positive.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.900
Sit down. Come on.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.747
I'll watch the beginning
of the game.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.280
- You're good luck.
- What's in your hand?

15:46.780 --> 15:50.284
It's a... It's...

15:51.076 --> 15:52.661
- See? Yeah.
- - Handkerchief?

15:55.080 --> 15:58.083
<i>And they give it
to DeSean Jackson, takes it downfield.</i>

15:58.250 --> 15:59.960
That's OCD. That's crazy.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.796
What OCD? I want my son
to watch with me, sue me.

16:02.963 --> 16:06.550
No, just sit down. Come on.
I want you to watch the game with me.

16:06.717 --> 16:08.302
I'm not superstitious.

16:08.469 --> 16:12.890
A small thing that I do. If I make money
what's the difference if I do this?

16:13.057 --> 16:15.142
It's a small thing.
Sit down. Come on.

16:15.309 --> 16:17.853
I'm making crabby snacks
and homemades.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.147
Touchdown!

16:20.314 --> 16:22.115
- Oh, whoa!
- - You see? You see that?

16:22.149 --> 16:25.110
You're meant to be here. This is special.
Everything happens for a reason.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.989
That's why you came home.
Embrace it. Embrace it.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.116
I'm the reason?
I don't think so.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.910
Yeah, Tommy.
Tommy, yes, yes.

16:33.077 --> 16:35.477
I got your whole sheet. Yup.
No, no. I'm just confirming. OK.

16:37.206 --> 16:39.208
- Wait, wait.
- Can I do an interview

16:39.375 --> 16:42.961
- on mental illness?
- No. Don't pay any attention.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.714
- Who was that? Rick D'Angelo?
- - That's him.

16:45.881 --> 16:49.051
- Guy who's having the problem?
- People are stupid.

16:49.218 --> 16:51.762
Don't let them hurt your feelings.
Patrick.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.681
Pat, don't look for Nikki.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.527
Get out of here
with that camera.

16:55.641 --> 16:57.059
- Patrick, please.
- Pat.

16:57.226 --> 17:00.145
- Patty. Patty.
- Don't look for Nikki!

17:23.544 --> 17:25.796
- Miss Metgers!
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

17:25.963 --> 17:30.008
Nance. It's my lucky day.
Look at you working on a Sunday.

17:30.175 --> 17:33.595
- How are you? Hey.
- What are you doing here?

17:33.762 --> 17:36.181
I just came by to say hi,
I'm ready to work.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.976
- You shouldn't be here.
- Full-time, half-time.

17:39.143 --> 17:41.854
I'll work, I'll sub,
I'll work history, whatever.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.689
Let me give you a hand. Sorry.

17:43.856 --> 17:46.525
- I got it. I got it.
- Let me ask you something.

17:46.692 --> 17:49.236
- Does Nikki still work here?
- Can't tell you.

17:49.403 --> 17:52.322
- But Doug Culpepper is.
- Why would you tell me that?

17:52.489 --> 17:55.492
He broke up my marriage.
Are you being a troublemaker?

17:55.659 --> 17:58.412
You look good.
Did you lose a lot of weight?

17:58.579 --> 18:02.249
- I did. Yeah, I did. Thank you.
- Aah! Get away from me. Get away.

18:02.416 --> 18:05.836
OK, all right. I'm better.
I'm better now. OK, I'm better.

18:06.003 --> 18:09.465
I feel so good. Look at my eyes.
Look how clear they are.

18:09.631 --> 18:12.384
- Don't hug me.
- Not a complainer, I'm positive.

18:12.551 --> 18:14.928
You have to give it time.
A lot went down.

18:15.095 --> 18:19.933
- People will get over it. It'll work out.
- I'll take that as a silver development.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.144
- That's a silver lining.
- Good luck.

18:27.149 --> 18:30.068
Ronnie. Pat.

18:31.737 --> 18:36.617
- There he is. He's back.
- Hey.

18:36.784 --> 18:38.285
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

18:38.452 --> 18:40.120
- Welcome back, man.
- I'm out.

18:40.287 --> 18:43.457
Yeah, you're "out" out? Cool.
You lost a lot of weight.

18:43.624 --> 18:46.710
I didn't recognise you.
I'm sorry I didn't visit you.

18:46.877 --> 18:49.588
Work's out of control.
You know, she had the baby.

18:49.755 --> 18:51.465
I'm really glad you're back.

18:51.632 --> 18:54.384
I miss you.
I really need someone to talk to.

18:55.093 --> 18:59.264
Come see the baby. She's beautiful.
Veronica wants to make dinner for you.

19:00.224 --> 19:03.602
Congratulations on the baby
but I'm not buying the invitation.

19:03.769 --> 19:06.313
Because you think Veronica
still hates you?

19:07.898 --> 19:10.734
- I know Veronica still hates me.
- That's not true.

19:10.901 --> 19:14.947
Yes, it is. Nikki always said that
Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar

19:15.113 --> 19:18.283
- where she keeps his balls, her purse.
- That's not true.

19:18.450 --> 19:21.036
- - What are you doing?
- OK, it's a little true.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.705
If you think she still hates you,
you're wrong

19:23.872 --> 19:26.208
because why would she
invite you to dinner, hm?

19:26.375 --> 19:28.377
- Did you invite him?
- - Yes!

19:28.544 --> 19:29.962
Well, can he make it?

19:30.128 --> 19:32.548
I don't know yet!

19:33.006 --> 19:35.843
- Can you make it next Sunday?
- Sure.

19:36.009 --> 19:39.888
- I'll see you next Sunday.
- You are still in touch with Nikki, right?

19:40.055 --> 19:42.766
- Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?
- Yeah.

19:44.685 --> 19:48.689
- Get in here, please. I need you.
- - OK.

19:48.856 --> 19:53.110
As soon as you left, Redskins threw
a trick play, a pitchout to Randal El.

19:53.277 --> 19:57.239
Andy Reid wastes a timeout challenging,
loses the challenge, the game.

19:57.406 --> 20:00.325
You're in this house,
show some respect for what I do.

20:00.492 --> 20:04.162
And we should spend time together.
I'm keeping you out of trouble.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.957
I have very, very good news.
Very good news.

20:07.124 --> 20:09.751
What's that? What's the good news?

20:10.502 --> 20:12.671
- - Things are looking up.
- Oh, are they?

20:13.547 --> 20:15.716
I knew why they invited me over.
I know.

20:15.883 --> 20:18.385
- She might be with that guy.
- - Oh, no way.

20:18.552 --> 20:20.929
- No, she might be with him.
- - No way, Dad.

20:21.096 --> 20:24.182
- She's afraid. She doesn't wanna talk.
- Doug Culpepper?

20:24.349 --> 20:27.227
- Put the phone down. Please.
- What are you doing?

20:27.394 --> 20:29.980
- - Stop.
- Look, look... Dad, Dad.

20:30.147 --> 20:32.316
- This is my life.
- Give me the phone.

20:32.482 --> 20:35.819
Give me the phone. Gotta
understand me. You wanna go back?

20:35.986 --> 20:37.404
Stop this. Don't do this.

20:37.571 --> 20:40.282
- Don't yell at me like that.
- Well, then don't behave this way.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.161
I got a call to check on this house.

20:44.328 --> 20:47.247
Pat Solatano? Yeah?
Mrs Solatano, Mr Solatano,

20:47.414 --> 20:50.417
I'm Officer Keogh.
I heard about the restraining order.

20:50.584 --> 20:53.420
You went to your old house, school.
It's not OK.

20:53.587 --> 20:56.632
I've been assigned to your case,
you'll see a lot of me.

20:56.798 --> 21:00.719
Do yourself a favour. Respect the
restraining order. Five hundred feet.

21:00.886 --> 21:04.014
You hear what he just said?
You have a restraining order.

21:04.181 --> 21:05.724
- Yeah, I know.
- Thank you.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.726
If you need anything, my card.

21:07.893 --> 21:11.647
- Thank you. Sorry. We understand.
- Since when do cops have cards?

21:16.276 --> 21:18.236
Tell me, would you like to be a guy

21:18.403 --> 21:21.073
who goes back to jail
or to the hospital? Hm?

21:21.239 --> 21:22.908
So take your medication.

21:23.075 --> 21:27.537
- If you do fine, we'll reduce them.
- Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape,

21:27.704 --> 21:30.415
get my life in order,
then she's gonna be with me.

21:30.582 --> 21:33.168
And that's better
than any medication.

21:33.502 --> 21:35.003
Pat, there's a possibility,

21:35.170 --> 21:38.048
I want you to be prepared for it,
she may not return.

21:38.215 --> 21:41.468
True love is about letting her go
and see if she returns.

21:41.760 --> 21:45.514
Meantime, if you listen to that song,
I don't want you to fall apart.

21:45.681 --> 21:48.100
So get a strategy, OK?
You need one.

21:48.266 --> 21:51.269
- Let me say... Gonna say something.
- OK.

21:52.521 --> 21:56.108
This is what I believe,
this is what I learned in the hospital.

21:56.566 --> 21:59.069
You do everything you can,
work your hardest.

21:59.236 --> 22:03.949
And if you do, if you stay positive,
you have a shot at a silver lining.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.536
- Work on a strategy, OK?
- All right.

22:09.454 --> 22:12.207
My friend Ronnie is having this party
on Sunday,

22:12.374 --> 22:14.543
and it's like a real hoity-toity thing

22:14.710 --> 22:17.504
and his wife Veronica's
a real stickler for...

22:17.671 --> 22:20.132
Mom got this Gap outfit
she wants me to wear,

22:20.298 --> 22:23.427
but I wanna wear a jersey
Jake got me from the Eagles.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.555
- Which jersey?
- DeSean Jackson.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.766
DeSean Jackson is the man.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.977
Well, that settles that.

22:40.193 --> 22:43.280
Pat! What are you doing?

22:44.031 --> 22:45.866
- I gotta go, man.
- Why?

22:46.158 --> 22:48.785
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have worn this.

22:48.952 --> 22:51.830
I like that jersey.
I wish I was wearing that jersey.

22:51.997 --> 22:54.958
- Are you comfortable?
- Veronica's not gonna like it.

22:55.125 --> 22:57.711
Guest of honour.
Come however you wanna come.

22:57.878 --> 22:59.755
- Really?
- Get over here.

23:00.338 --> 23:02.299
DeSean Jackson's in the house.

23:02.883 --> 23:04.926
- You mean rookie of the year?
- - Yeah.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.888
DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson?

23:08.055 --> 23:09.973
Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.351
- Isn't it awesome?
- Not for dinner.

23:13.518 --> 23:17.272
- Look, he got us flowers.
- Oh, aw, that's sweet. That's sweet, Pat.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.316
- That's lovely. Hey.
- And wine.

23:19.483 --> 23:22.194
Check this out.
We just redid the whole thing.

23:22.360 --> 23:25.530
- Wow. Tremendous.
- Isn't it great?

23:25.697 --> 23:28.784
- Yeah. I'm thinking of redoing it again.
- Why?

23:28.950 --> 23:32.496
- You're making a lot.
- We're doing all right. I can't complain.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.498
- Isn't the market down?
- It is.

23:34.664 --> 23:37.250
But she wants more
so I'm giving her more, man.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.835
My dad lost his pension.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.713
- Sorry. A lot of people. My uncle too.
- Really?

23:41.880 --> 23:45.425
No disrespect, it's not personal,
but this is the time to strike.

23:45.884 --> 23:48.720
You start snapping up
commercial real estate, cheap.

23:48.887 --> 23:51.807
You flip it over
and that's when you make the money.

23:51.973 --> 23:55.310
But the pressure. Man, it's like...

23:57.896 --> 23:59.606
You OK?
I'm not OK.

23:59.773 --> 24:01.691
Don't tell anybody.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.152
Listen to me.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.780
I feel like I'm getting crushed and...

24:06.947 --> 24:10.659
- Crushed by what?
- Everything. Family, the baby, the job.

24:10.826 --> 24:13.870
The fucking dicks at work,
and it's like, you know...

24:14.037 --> 24:19.376
Like, I'm trying to do this, you know,
and then I'm, like, suffocating.

24:20.001 --> 24:21.503
Holy shit.

24:21.670 --> 24:23.880
You can't be happy all the time.

24:24.047 --> 24:28.051
- Who told you you can't be happy?
- Do your best, you have no choice.

24:28.218 --> 24:30.387
- Not true at all. Ronnie, Ronnie.
- You just can't.

24:32.139 --> 24:34.975
I hope you're OK with Veronica's sister
coming over. OK with that?

24:35.142 --> 24:37.644
- Who?
- Veronica's sister.

24:37.811 --> 24:40.939
- Tiffany and Tommy?
- Tiffany. Yeah. Just Tiffany.

24:41.231 --> 24:43.441
- What happened to Tommy?
- He died.

24:43.608 --> 24:45.694
- Tommy died?
- Cops die.

24:45.861 --> 24:47.946
- How'd he die?
- Don't bring it up.

24:48.113 --> 24:51.032
- No, how did he die?
- How did who die?

24:53.243 --> 24:55.036
Hey, Tiffany. This is Pat.

24:55.203 --> 24:57.747
Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.128
You look nice.

25:03.295 --> 25:05.255
- Thank you.
- I'm not flirting.

25:05.422 --> 25:06.882
I didn't think you were.

25:07.048 --> 25:10.343
I see you made an effort.
I'm gonna be better with my wife.

25:10.635 --> 25:12.429
I wanna acknowledge her beauty.

25:12.596 --> 25:14.097
I never used to do that.

25:14.264 --> 25:17.392
Gonna do that.
We're gonna be better than ever, Nikki.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.686
Just practicing. How'd Tommy die?

25:22.689 --> 25:24.107
What about your job?

25:24.900 --> 25:27.527
- I just got fired, actually.
- Oh, really? How?

25:28.028 --> 25:30.197
I mean, I'm sorry.
How'd that happen?

25:31.323 --> 25:33.283
Does it really matter?

25:34.034 --> 25:36.786
Baby, how's it going?

25:36.953 --> 25:39.664
- Great, great.
- Everyone having fun?

25:39.998 --> 25:42.042
Oh, baby, can we
show them the house?

25:42.209 --> 25:44.377
- Please, please, please.
- - The whole house?

25:44.544 --> 25:48.131
Yeah. It'll be fun. It'll be
fun. We're gonna go on a tour now.

25:48.298 --> 25:51.009
- Let's go see the house.
- - Let's go for the tour.

25:51.176 --> 25:53.887
I've been planning
this forever. I love our house.

25:54.054 --> 25:56.473
- I'm really excited about it.
- Come on.

25:57.891 --> 26:00.352
- Guess what it is.
- Oh, it's a television.

26:00.518 --> 26:02.395
- It's a computer screen.
- - Nope.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.105
- Keep going.
- A brick oven.

26:04.272 --> 26:05.815
- It's a light.
- Oh, warmer.

26:05.982 --> 26:10.445
It's a drawer where they pull out dead
bodies, shoot them with formaldehyde.

26:10.612 --> 26:13.240
- Where would the body go though?
- It's a joke.

26:13.657 --> 26:17.160
It's a fireplace.

26:17.327 --> 26:19.537
In the middle of the wall?

26:19.704 --> 26:23.166
We have a port in every room.
Who doesn't have an iPod?

26:24.459 --> 26:26.795
I don't have an iPod.
I don't have a phone.

26:26.962 --> 26:29.714
They won't let me.
They think I'm gonna call Nikki.

26:29.881 --> 26:32.467
- Don't worry about it.
- I would call Nikki.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.511
I'm gonna give you
one of my iPods.

26:34.678 --> 26:37.138
Give me your iPod.
Give it to me. Thank you.

26:37.514 --> 26:39.808
Of all the rooms
there are iPod ports in,

26:39.975 --> 26:42.310
I'm happy you brought us
into the bathroom.

26:42.477 --> 26:44.187
I can play music in any room.

26:44.354 --> 26:46.898
Can you play "Ride the Lightning"
by Metallica?

26:49.943 --> 26:53.071
Pat was a history sub
at the high school, Tiffany.

26:53.238 --> 26:55.615
Ask him about any president,
knows them all.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.868
Here's a fun fact. You know
where the term OK comes from?

26:59.452 --> 27:01.121
No. No, I don't.

27:01.288 --> 27:03.164
- Where?
- Martin Van Buren,

27:03.331 --> 27:06.501
eighth president of the United States,
is from Kinderhook.

27:06.668 --> 27:09.879
He was part of a club,
a men's club called Old Kinderhook.

27:10.297 --> 27:14.342
And if you were cool, you were in
the club, they'd say, "That guy's OK."

27:14.509 --> 27:16.386
- In the Old Kinderhooks.
- Really?

27:16.553 --> 27:18.596
- Pretty cool, right?
- Interesting.

27:18.763 --> 27:22.684
Tiffany's been doing this dance thing
for years. She's real good at it.

27:22.851 --> 27:25.353
She'll be competing
at the Ben Franklin Hotel.

27:25.520 --> 27:29.190
- Really? Nikki loves dance.
- Why do you have to talk like that?

27:29.357 --> 27:31.443
I'm bragging about you. Can I brag?

27:31.609 --> 27:35.030
- Don't talk about me in the third person.
- - Give me a break.

27:35.196 --> 27:38.241
- I'm right here.
- - Just be nice. Just be nice.

27:38.408 --> 27:41.953
- Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.
- Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.

27:42.287 --> 27:43.705
I know. I know. I know.

27:45.206 --> 27:49.127
- What meds are you on?
- Me? None.

27:49.294 --> 27:52.005
I used to be on lithium,
and Seroquel and Abilify,

27:52.172 --> 27:54.090
but I don't take them anymore, no.

27:54.257 --> 27:57.052
They make me foggy
and they also make me bloated.

27:57.218 --> 28:01.556
Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but
I agree, I wasn't as sharp so I stopped.

28:01.723 --> 28:04.017
- You ever take Klonopin?
- Klonopin? Yeah.

28:04.184 --> 28:05.602
- Right?
- Jesus.

28:05.769 --> 28:07.979
- Like, "What? What day is it?"
- Yeah.

28:08.146 --> 28:10.523
- How about trazodone?
- Trazodone?

28:10.690 --> 28:12.984
It flattens you out.
I mean, you are done.

28:13.151 --> 28:16.946
- It takes the life right out of your eyes.
- God, I bet it does.

28:22.285 --> 28:25.830
- I'm tired. I wanna go.
- - No, no, no. We haven't...

28:25.997 --> 28:28.833
We haven't finished the salad yet
or the duck...

28:29.000 --> 28:30.668
I made fire and ice cake.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.754
I said I'm tired.

28:32.921 --> 28:35.382
Are you gonna walk me home
or what?

28:37.342 --> 28:40.470
- You mean me?
- Yeah, you. You gonna walk me home?

28:41.805 --> 28:44.391
You have poor social skills.
You have a problem.

28:44.557 --> 28:48.770
You say more inappropriate things than
appropriate things. You scare people.

28:48.937 --> 28:53.066
- I tell the truth. You're mean.
- What, I'm not telling the truth?

28:53.983 --> 28:56.236
Um, maybe I should drive them home?

28:56.403 --> 28:59.280
No, you can drive them
both home. Now.

28:59.447 --> 29:03.618
Stop talking about me in third person.
You love it when I have problems.

29:03.785 --> 29:06.704
You love it because then
you can be the good one.

29:06.871 --> 29:08.289
No, I don't. I don't.

29:08.456 --> 29:11.543
- I just wanted to have a nice dinner.
- - God.

29:12.127 --> 29:13.545
What is your problem?

29:13.711 --> 29:16.381
Nothing's my problem.
I'm tired, I wanna go.

29:16.548 --> 29:19.008
- - You really wanna go?
- I really wanna go.

29:19.175 --> 29:21.428
- It's been great.
- The baby is sleeping.

29:21.594 --> 29:25.098
- Sorry, I don't wanna wake up the baby.
- - Sorry, man.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.323
This is me.

29:42.490 --> 29:44.909
I haven't dated
since before my marriage,

29:45.076 --> 29:47.120
so I don't remember how this works.

29:47.495 --> 29:48.913
How what works?

29:49.706 --> 29:52.375
I saw the way
you were looking at me, Pat.

29:52.542 --> 29:53.960
You felt it, I felt it.

29:54.127 --> 29:57.338
Don't lie.
We're not liars like they are.

29:57.547 --> 30:00.925
I live in the addition,
separate from my parents' house,

30:01.092 --> 30:04.137
so there's no chance of them
walking in on us.

30:04.304 --> 30:07.348
I hate that you wore a jersey
because I hate football,

30:07.515 --> 30:10.727
but you can fuck me
if you turn the lights off, OK?

30:12.395 --> 30:13.980
How old are you?

30:14.647 --> 30:18.610
Old enough to have a marriage end
and not wind up in a mental hospital.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.490
I had a good time tonight.

30:23.656 --> 30:26.242
I think you're pretty,
but I'm married, OK?

30:28.703 --> 30:30.455
You're married?

30:31.498 --> 30:33.082
So am I.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.752
No, that's confusing. He's dead.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.845
Wait, what? What's happening?

30:48.848 --> 30:50.808
Oh, my God.

30:50.975 --> 30:52.769
Hey.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.127
Are you OK? Ronnie called.

31:18.294 --> 31:20.713
- That makeup on your shirt?
- I don't know.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.591
- Whoa. What happened?
- When am I gonna get a phone?

31:23.758 --> 31:25.927
- In due time. What happened?
- Pat.

31:50.159 --> 31:52.519
Mom, Mom. Mom,
I can't find my wedding video.

31:52.537 --> 31:53.955
Mom, wake up.

31:54.122 --> 31:57.208
- What is it?
- It's after 3.00, what are you doing?

31:57.375 --> 32:00.920
I looked in here, but this is
all your shit. You put it up here?

32:01.087 --> 32:03.298
What about
in your father's study?

32:03.673 --> 32:05.091
Don't go in my study.

32:05.258 --> 32:08.303
Dad, not now. Would you put it in here?
Makes no sense.

32:08.469 --> 32:11.889
- What are you doing?
- He's got all his Eagles videos.

32:12.056 --> 32:13.474
- Is it here?
- - Patty!

32:13.641 --> 32:15.310
It's probably in the attic.

32:15.476 --> 32:17.145
Are you going in my study?

32:17.312 --> 32:20.315
It feels to me like you wanna hide
my wedding video.

32:20.773 --> 32:23.818
- You think I can't handle it?
- Please stop yelling.

32:24.235 --> 32:28.072
I'm not yelling, I'm just frustrated!
I should have my wedding video!

32:28.239 --> 32:30.158
Pat, you're gonna
wake everybody up!

32:30.325 --> 32:32.410
I already looked all over there.

32:35.872 --> 32:37.957
- - Calm down.
- I'm not calming down!

32:38.124 --> 32:41.628
I don't give a fuck! I'm not calming
down! Anybody can wake up!

32:41.794 --> 32:45.590
I'm not ashamed of it!
Let the whole neighbourhood wake up!

32:45.757 --> 32:48.134
- I don't care! No, Mom!
- - Stop it! Stop it!

32:48.301 --> 32:50.637
- What's going on?
- - Lower it down!

32:50.803 --> 32:52.805
What? Hey.

32:52.972 --> 32:56.517
- It's my wedding! It's my wedding video!
- - Pat, stop it, stop it, stop it!

32:58.519 --> 33:00.146
I can't watch a video? No!

33:00.313 --> 33:02.523
I can hear the fucking song
in my head!

33:12.742 --> 33:14.744
<i>Stop!</i>

33:18.331 --> 33:20.124
- - Mom?
- What the fuck you doing?

33:20.291 --> 33:22.585
- You throw your mother on...!
- - No, no.

33:22.752 --> 33:24.212
Stop it!

33:24.879 --> 33:27.715
Get off me, Dad.

33:28.508 --> 33:30.802
- - I'm not doing...!
- Stop hitting him!

33:31.135 --> 33:33.012
Patrizio, don't hit him!

33:33.179 --> 33:37.392
- I'm not hitting him! He's hitting me!
- - Stop it, Dad!

33:39.143 --> 33:41.729
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

33:42.146 --> 33:44.565
Police. Open the door, please.

33:44.732 --> 33:46.359
Open up.

33:46.526 --> 33:50.488
Mr Solatano, I got a lot of calls.
People are scared. I gotta come in.

33:51.447 --> 33:53.574
How are we doing in here, huh?

33:53.741 --> 33:56.994
A lot of reports from your neighbours.
We got phone calls...

33:57.161 --> 33:59.414
Nikki is being manipulated
and controlled.

33:59.580 --> 34:00.998
Hey, sit down.

34:01.165 --> 34:04.752
Stop with these crazy theories.
He's a cop. What are you doing?

34:04.919 --> 34:07.338
It's a medication problem,
but he's fine.

34:07.505 --> 34:10.882
Wanna send him back to Baltimore?
We know about the explosion.

34:11.050 --> 34:14.387
What explo...? No. Cliff is lying.
He's not allowed to talk about that.

34:16.139 --> 34:17.556
Jesus Christ, who's that?

34:17.724 --> 34:20.768
- - Keep an eye on him.
- Is this a bipolar episode?

34:20.935 --> 34:24.397
- Get out of here, little fucking idiot.
- Someone help me!

34:24.563 --> 34:28.109
- You can't tell Nikki about this.
- I had to make out a report.

34:28.317 --> 34:30.069
- Hey, sit down.
- Listen, sir.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.112
This guy's chasing me!
Help Me!

34:33.156 --> 34:35.241
- - Sit down.
- I could write a letter...

34:35.408 --> 34:39.036
She has a court order against you,
500 feet... Listen to me!

34:39.203 --> 34:42.540
I'll take that camera
and I'm gonna break it over your head.

34:42.706 --> 34:47.128
I'm gonna interview you, what it's like to
get that camera broken over your head.

34:47.295 --> 34:50.882
- What are you laughing about? Sorry.
- - I'm sorry.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.592
Stop all that fucking noise.

34:52.759 --> 34:56.053
Go back to sleep, the party's over.
Show's over.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.140
Not a reflection of where I'm at.
You can't tell her.

34:59.307 --> 35:01.225
- You can't tell Nikki.
- Pipe down.

35:01.392 --> 35:02.894
Everything all right?

35:03.060 --> 35:06.063
- Who was that, Dad?
- - That kid with the camera.

35:06.230 --> 35:07.831
Good luck. I gotta write this up.

35:07.899 --> 35:09.859
Come on, don't write it up.

35:10.026 --> 35:11.903
It's OK, everything is OK.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.280
We're fine.
Thank you, we appreciate it.

35:14.447 --> 35:15.948
Thank you.

36:09.794 --> 36:11.504
- Hey!
- Whoa! Hey.

36:11.671 --> 36:13.714
What the hell?

36:14.507 --> 36:17.009
- What happened?
- Weight lifting accident.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.804
That sounds like bullshit.

36:19.971 --> 36:21.597
WhY'd You run by my house?

36:21.764 --> 36:25.685
- Did our conversation get you upset?
- This is my route. Just back oh'.

36:25.852 --> 36:27.937
My neighbourhood.
You ran by my house.

36:28.271 --> 36:31.023
- I like to run by myself, OK?
- Me too.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.234
- I like to run alone. Stop.
- What?

36:33.401 --> 36:35.069
- I'm running here.
- Me too.

36:35.236 --> 36:38.531
Run somewhere else.
There's tons of roads to run in.

36:38.698 --> 36:41.784
- I like this road, my neighbourhood.
- Come on, please!

36:41.951 --> 36:43.494
Calm down, crazy.

36:44.579 --> 36:46.163
Why are you...?

37:05.182 --> 37:06.851
Damn it.

37:07.977 --> 37:10.229
- - Hey!
- What the fuck?

37:10.396 --> 37:12.356
- I'm married!
- So am I!

37:12.523 --> 37:14.775
What are you doing?
Your husband's dead!

37:14.942 --> 37:17.111
- Where is your wife?
- You're crazy!

37:17.278 --> 37:20.031
I'm not the one
that just got out of that hospital.

37:20.197 --> 37:21.657
I'm not the big slut!

37:25.161 --> 37:27.455
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:27.622 --> 37:30.666
- I'm sorry.
- I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore.

37:30.833 --> 37:34.211
There's a part of me
that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that,

37:34.378 --> 37:36.297
with all the other parts of myself.

37:36.464 --> 37:39.842
Can you say the same about yourself,
fucker? Can you forgive?

37:40.009 --> 37:42.053
Are you any good at that?

37:47.183 --> 37:50.478
- Trouble last night.
- Let me just set the record straight.

37:50.645 --> 37:52.396
Hurting my mother was a mistake.

37:52.563 --> 37:55.816
I hate myself for it.
I hate my illness, I wanna control it.

37:55.983 --> 37:58.861
My father had no trouble
slapping the shit out of me,

37:59.028 --> 38:01.989
which I did not return
because I could've killed him.

38:02.156 --> 38:04.450
He's 65.
Don't think I could've beat him?

38:04.617 --> 38:07.161
He was scared for your mother
and you hurt him.

38:07.328 --> 38:08.829
Yes, last night was a mess.

38:08.996 --> 38:11.791
And I think he probably
just tried to do his best.

38:12.375 --> 38:15.252
Pat, you have to have a strategy,
I told you earlier.

38:15.419 --> 38:19.632
Recognise these feelings. Otherwise
you will be sent back to Baltimore.

38:19.799 --> 38:23.135
So when you get these feelings,
you get to a quieter place

38:23.302 --> 38:25.930
with peace with yourself,
however you can.

38:26.097 --> 38:29.308
- Yeah, that's easier said than done.
- You have no choice.

38:29.892 --> 38:33.479
- Excelsior.
- Yeah, excelsior.

38:33.646 --> 38:36.774
Listen, I have a letter
I want you to give Nikki, OK?

38:36.941 --> 38:38.484
- No.
- Why?

38:38.651 --> 38:41.153
Because you have
a restraining order.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.240
What good are you, man?

38:44.573 --> 38:47.910
Why did you have this urgency
to see your wedding video?

38:48.077 --> 38:50.496
Because I'm married,
I haven't seen my wife.

38:50.663 --> 38:54.625
Maybe you think Nikki's not around
and Tiffany's an attractive girl.

38:54.792 --> 38:58.879
Get drawn towards Tiffany, you'll spoil
your chances of getting Nikki back?

38:59.046 --> 39:00.881
Not bad, Dr Jones.

39:01.048 --> 39:04.760
I don't think I'm gonna blow it
with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.

39:04.927 --> 39:08.973
- Why is she a slut?
- After the dinner, she said, quote,

39:09.140 --> 39:11.892
"We can go to the back house
and you can fuck me

39:12.059 --> 39:15.521
"as long as we turn the lights out,"
unquote.

39:15.688 --> 39:17.815
And she still wears
her wedding ring.

39:17.982 --> 39:20.609
So she's a loyal,
married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

39:20.776 --> 39:24.530
Maybe she needs a friend
and she thought if she offers you sex,

39:24.697 --> 39:27.742
it will be easier for you
to become friends with her.

39:27.908 --> 39:30.077
She said she's not a whore anymore,

39:30.244 --> 39:32.913
but she likes that part of herself

39:33.080 --> 39:36.667
along with all the other parts of herself,
and can I say the same?

39:36.834 --> 39:38.419
Can you?

39:39.045 --> 39:40.463
Is that...? You're ask...?

39:40.629 --> 39:43.424
- You're really asking me that question?
- Yes.

39:44.592 --> 39:46.844
With all my crazy sad shit?
Are you nuts?

39:47.011 --> 39:49.263
Pat, the silver lining thing is yours.

39:49.430 --> 39:52.183
I'm just giving back
your words to you.

39:52.349 --> 39:56.645
This crazy sad shit, as you call it,
made you a happier, calmer person

39:56.812 --> 40:00.900
with a beautiful, positive philosophy
of going outdoors, working out

40:01.067 --> 40:04.361
- and reading books.
- No. No, not the books.

40:04.528 --> 40:07.698
You said Nikki is friends
with Ronnie, Veronica, Tiffany.

40:07.865 --> 40:09.784
If you become friends with Tiffany,

40:09.950 --> 40:13.329
Nikki will think you're a kind, generous,
large-hearted person

40:13.496 --> 40:17.124
who helps people in need,
who is basically thriving.

40:17.291 --> 40:21.796
So if you help Tiffany,
it will be good for you.

40:24.006 --> 40:26.175
Trick or treat?

40:29.261 --> 40:31.430
Trick or treat?

40:33.557 --> 40:35.101
Trick or treat?

40:42.316 --> 40:44.235
- Hey!
- Whoa!

40:45.194 --> 40:48.572
- How do you know when I run?
- I wanted to clarify something.

40:49.031 --> 40:51.742
I just want us to be friends.

40:52.785 --> 40:54.995
Did you hear what I said?

40:55.996 --> 40:59.166
Why are you giving me
such a hard time?

41:00.292 --> 41:02.628
No, I'm not giving you a hard time.

41:04.046 --> 41:07.341
I don't know how to act
with you when you do this shit.

41:08.092 --> 41:10.719
You wanna have dinner at this diner?

41:14.640 --> 41:16.350
Pick me up at 7.30.

41:20.187 --> 41:22.231
- Trick or treat?
- Wait up!

41:22.398 --> 41:24.942
Ooh, I got a king-size.

41:53.470 --> 41:56.098
- Happy Halloween.
- Hi.

42:17.161 --> 42:19.872
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

42:22.291 --> 42:25.502
- Gonna get a bowl of your Raisin Bran.
- - Great.

42:27.338 --> 42:28.881
Tea.

42:30.549 --> 42:32.593
Be right back.

42:37.306 --> 42:38.849
You look nice.

42:39.016 --> 42:40.517
Thanks.

42:42.811 --> 42:44.688
Raisin Bran.

42:44.855 --> 42:46.732
Here's some milk for you.

42:48.234 --> 42:49.777
- Thank you.
- - Mm-hm.

43:04.833 --> 43:06.585
Do you wanna share this?

43:06.752 --> 43:09.171
Why did you order Raisin Bran?

43:10.339 --> 43:12.466
Why did you order tea?

43:13.300 --> 43:15.552
Because you ordered Raisin Bran.

43:15.719 --> 43:19.848
Because I didn't want there to be
any mistaking it for a date.

43:20.349 --> 43:24.436
- It can still be if you order Raisin Bran.
- It's not a date.

43:25.854 --> 43:28.357
So how's your thing going?
Dancing thing.

43:28.524 --> 43:30.442
Good. How's your restraining order?

43:30.609 --> 43:33.737
I wouldn't actually call
the restraining order my thing,

43:33.904 --> 43:37.741
but getting back with Nikki is,
and I think I'm doing pretty well.

43:37.908 --> 43:39.868
Except for a minor incident.

43:40.035 --> 43:42.454
And the so-called incident
with the weights.

43:42.621 --> 43:45.249
Yeah. That was a thing
with my parents.

43:45.416 --> 43:49.962
I wish I could just explain it all in
a letter to Nikki because it was minor.

43:50.129 --> 43:54.675
And I could just explain it and let her
know I'm actually not out of control.

43:55.050 --> 43:58.304
And that I'm actually...
I'm doing really well.

44:05.769 --> 44:08.063
I can get a letter to Nikki.

44:08.272 --> 44:11.108
I see her sometimes with my sister.

44:18.991 --> 44:21.035
It would be so amazing

44:21.201 --> 44:23.871
if you could get a letter to Nikki
from me.

44:24.246 --> 44:27.916
I'd have to hide it from Veronica.
She's not into breaking the law,

44:28.083 --> 44:30.461
which this letter
would definitely be doing.

44:31.837 --> 44:33.881
But you would do it?

44:36.175 --> 44:38.302
I'd have to be careful.

44:38.469 --> 44:42.514
I'm already on thin ice with my family.
You should hear how I lost my job.

44:42.681 --> 44:44.725
How'd you lose your job?

44:44.892 --> 44:46.477
By...

44:47.394 --> 44:50.939
...having sex with everybody
in the office.

44:52.066 --> 44:53.942
Everybody?

44:54.109 --> 44:57.488
I was very depressed after Tommy died.
It was a lot of people.

44:57.654 --> 44:59.531
We don't have to talk about it.

44:59.698 --> 45:01.575
- How many were there?
- Eleven.

45:01.742 --> 45:04.286
- Wow.
- I know.

45:04.828 --> 45:07.706
- I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.
- OK.

45:08.499 --> 45:10.250
Can I ask you one more question?

45:12.669 --> 45:14.254
Were there any women?

45:15.214 --> 45:16.965
- Yes.
- Really?

45:17.132 --> 45:18.842
Yes.

45:19.093 --> 45:21.845
- What was that like?
- Hot.

45:22.012 --> 45:23.931
Jesus Christ.

45:26.767 --> 45:32.189
Was it like older women, a sexy teacher
who wants to seduce you...?

45:32.356 --> 45:34.691
Made me sit on her lap
and do things? Yeah.

45:36.318 --> 45:39.780
- What? You sat on her lap?
- Mm-hm.

45:39.947 --> 45:42.741
- She told you what to do?
- Mm-hm.

45:42.908 --> 45:48.038
Oh, my God. Nikki hated when I talked
like this. Made me feel like such a perv.

45:48.205 --> 45:51.417
- Maybe we should change the subject.
- I don't mind it.

45:51.834 --> 45:55.421
- You don't, do you?
- No.

45:56.213 --> 45:59.758
But then people were getting in fights
in the parking lot at work

45:59.925 --> 46:02.094
and in the bathroom.

46:02.261 --> 46:07.224
And the boss called me in to his office
and tried to pin it all on me.

46:07.391 --> 46:10.394
So I accused him of harassment.

46:10.561 --> 46:15.941
And then they fired me, sent me home
and put me on some meds.

46:16.608 --> 46:18.318
I get it.

46:19.611 --> 46:22.489
The song that was playing
when my wife

46:22.656 --> 46:25.742
- was in the shower with the teacher.
- Heard about that.

46:25.909 --> 46:28.871
My wedding song.
When I hear it, I go kind of crazy.

46:29.037 --> 46:31.915
Sometimes I hear it
when it's not even playing.

46:32.124 --> 46:34.543
- Wow.
- Yeah.

46:34.710 --> 46:37.629
So they put me on medication,
which I feel ashamed of.

46:37.796 --> 46:40.382
- Yeah.
- So I know.

46:40.549 --> 46:42.134
Mm-hm.

46:42.885 --> 46:45.053
I just gotta get a strategy,
you know?

46:45.762 --> 46:47.639
Me too.

46:47.806 --> 46:51.351
- Better get back to the letter.
- Let's get back to the letter.

46:51.518 --> 46:54.897
What if you told Nikki
when Veronica was in the bathroom?

46:55.063 --> 46:56.773
Yes.

46:56.940 --> 47:00.235
Yes, that could work. I love that.

47:00.402 --> 47:03.071
I'm gonna go home
and write the letter right now.

47:03.238 --> 47:04.948
Can I at least finish my tea?

47:05.115 --> 47:07.159
- What?
- My tea. Can I finish it?

47:07.534 --> 47:08.952
Wait a minute.

47:09.119 --> 47:11.538
Did Veronica tell Nikki
about our dinner?

47:11.705 --> 47:16.293
- Why would she do that? Was it a test?
- I kind of got that feeling, yeah.

47:16.460 --> 47:18.921
Goddamn it. I knew it.

47:19.087 --> 47:22.549
It was a test. How did I do?
I think I did pretty well.

47:22.716 --> 47:24.760
She said you were cool, basically.

47:25.219 --> 47:29.097
Basically?
Was I some percentage not cool?

47:29.431 --> 47:31.892
No, she said you were cool,
but, you know...

47:33.101 --> 47:34.728
No, I don't know.

47:35.646 --> 47:40.192
- Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.
- What do you mean? How am I?

47:40.359 --> 47:43.946
- What does that mean?
- Sort of like me.

47:44.112 --> 47:45.989
Sort of like you?

47:46.156 --> 47:48.742
I hope to God
she didn't tell Nikki that.

47:49.910 --> 47:53.539
- Why?
- Because it...

47:53.705 --> 47:57.626
It's just not right.
Lumping you and I together, it's...

47:58.085 --> 48:01.296
I mean, it's just wrong,
and Nikki wouldn't like that.

48:01.463 --> 48:04.508
Especially after all the shit
you just told me.

48:05.926 --> 48:08.178
You think that I'm crazier than you.

48:08.595 --> 48:10.806
Because...

48:12.307 --> 48:13.725
We're different, I mean...

48:14.726 --> 48:17.145
Oh, my God.

48:18.188 --> 48:21.608
Ugh. You're killing me.

48:24.778 --> 48:26.572
You know what?

48:26.863 --> 48:28.615
Forget I offered to help you.

48:29.199 --> 48:31.702
Forget the entire fucking idea.

48:31.868 --> 48:34.413
Because that must have been
fucking crazy

48:34.580 --> 48:37.165
because I am so much crazier
than you.

48:37.457 --> 48:40.460
- Keep your voice down.
- I'm just the crazy slut

48:40.627 --> 48:42.629
with a dead husband!

48:43.213 --> 48:46.049
- Forget it! Fuck you!
- - Shut the fuck up.

48:47.551 --> 48:50.012
- You shut the fuck up.
- Tiffany. Tiffany.

48:51.763 --> 48:53.181
Hey.

48:54.308 --> 48:56.101
Go get her, man.

49:00.105 --> 49:01.523
Slow down, Raisin Bran.

49:02.649 --> 49:06.236
Hey. Hey, come on. Look,
I don't think you're crazy, all right?

49:06.403 --> 49:08.655
Yes, you do. You told your therapist

49:08.822 --> 49:12.159
you were in a superior mental
illness category, didn't you?

49:12.326 --> 49:14.536
- Hey, calm down.
- Just leave me alone.

49:14.703 --> 49:19.333
Can I just explain myself? I didn't want
Nikki to think that I was associated

49:19.499 --> 49:22.252
with that behaviour
because I've never done that.

49:22.419 --> 49:25.297
You may not have experienced
the shit that I did,

49:25.464 --> 49:27.799
but you loved hearing about it,
didn't you?

49:28.425 --> 49:30.302
You are afraid to be alive.

49:30.594 --> 49:32.596
- That's...
- You are afraid to live.

49:32.763 --> 49:35.766
You're a hypocrite. You're a conformist.
You're a liar.

49:35.932 --> 49:39.436
I opened up to you and you judged me.
You are an asshole.

49:39.603 --> 49:42.356
- You are an asshole. Get off of me.
- Calm down.

49:42.522 --> 49:45.192
Get off! You're harassing me!
He's harassing me!

49:45.359 --> 49:46.860
Shut up!

49:48.779 --> 49:50.530
- Get off.
- Man, take it easy.

49:50.697 --> 49:52.741
- Dude, relax.
- He's harassing me.

49:52.908 --> 49:55.202
- - Get off me, dude.
- He's harassing me!

49:55.369 --> 49:57.245
Stop it. Back off, all right?

49:57.412 --> 50:01.166
- Calm down! Go home.
- Get off of me.

50:01.333 --> 50:04.211
- Shut up, shut up. Stop it.
- Shut up.

50:14.012 --> 50:16.431
- - Hey, hey, get off me.
- What are you doing?

50:16.598 --> 50:19.059
Come on,
what are you doing to these kids?

50:19.226 --> 50:22.562
You being a punk with these kids?
Wanna go back to Baltimore?

50:22.729 --> 50:25.982
Is that what you wanna do?
What did these kids do to you?

50:26.149 --> 50:29.444
You're begging to go back to Baltimore.
What's the matter?

50:29.611 --> 50:32.406
- You're sick.
- It's the kids. It's the kids.

50:32.572 --> 50:35.534
Honestly, he didn't do anything.
It was all the kids.

50:35.701 --> 50:38.662
- They started it. He didn't do anything.
- - Come on.

50:38.829 --> 50:41.623
Come here. What are you
gonna do about that song? Huh?

50:41.790 --> 50:44.209
Gonna go your whole life
scared of that song?

50:44.376 --> 50:47.295
It's a song. Don't make it a monster.

50:47.546 --> 50:49.506
Come on, breathe. There's no song.

50:49.673 --> 50:51.675
There's no song.

50:52.050 --> 50:53.719
There's no song playing.

50:59.725 --> 51:01.601
That's it.

51:03.061 --> 51:06.231
That's it. Do it more. There you go.

51:06.398 --> 51:08.942
- - Move it out. Let's go. Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

51:09.276 --> 51:11.027
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

51:11.194 --> 51:13.655
- Where are you going?
- I took it too far.

51:13.822 --> 51:15.615
Hey, was he messing with you?

51:15.782 --> 51:18.577
No, this was just a joke.
This is a joke I started.

51:18.744 --> 51:22.622
There's a restraining order on this guy.
That's not a good thing to do.

51:22.789 --> 51:26.126
- I'm fucked up. What can I tell you?
- You're Tommy's widow?

51:26.293 --> 51:30.172
I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow,
minus the whore thing for the most part.

51:30.338 --> 51:34.426
You're a funny girl.
You wanna get a drink sometime?

51:37.512 --> 51:40.390
- What'd I say?
- She doesn't do that anymore.

51:53.403 --> 51:55.572
- I'm sorry about what I said.
- I know.

51:56.323 --> 51:58.784
- You didn't mean it.
- I didn't mean it.

51:58.950 --> 52:01.578
I know you say shit
you don't mean all the time.

52:01.745 --> 52:04.456
I'll still give your letter to Nikki.
Don't worry.

52:04.623 --> 52:08.043
Wow. Oh, I really appreciate that,
Tiffany.

52:08.210 --> 52:10.712
- I know you do.
- You do?

52:12.464 --> 52:14.424
Yeah, sure.

52:15.717 --> 52:17.761
I'll see you tomorrow?

52:17.928 --> 52:19.721
With the letter?

52:22.224 --> 52:25.143
I'll bet I know what happened
if only one is missing.

52:25.310 --> 52:29.022
Either Dolores or Pat needed
an envelope and one of them took it.

52:29.189 --> 52:31.316
- That's the only answer.
- No, no, no.

52:31.858 --> 52:35.487
Dolores. Somebody was in my study.
Who took one of my envelopes?

52:35.654 --> 52:37.072
Somebody took an envelope.

52:38.114 --> 52:41.910
- Maybe we should call the FBI.
- No, don't make fun. It's serious.

52:42.077 --> 52:44.663
We'll take a look.
I'll show you what this is.

52:44.830 --> 52:48.542
I'm gonna explain to you something.
You know what I'm doing, honey.

52:48.708 --> 52:51.711
This is everything... I got this.
It all corresponds...

52:51.878 --> 52:55.423
- Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes.
- No, it's not OK.

52:55.590 --> 52:57.926
"Do not go in my study
or I will eat you."

52:58.093 --> 53:01.805
It's not funny. What's
everybody making a joke out of this for?

53:01.972 --> 53:04.349
Dolores, you are so beautiful.

53:04.516 --> 53:07.352
Stop that.
Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop.

53:07.519 --> 53:11.356
A lot of envelopes go in and out
of my office every day after games,

53:11.523 --> 53:14.609
a lot of cash in them
so show some respect for what I do.

53:14.776 --> 53:16.528
I wanted to tell you the number.

53:16.695 --> 53:20.115
Envelope was empty. Didn't wanna
wake you, needed an envelope.

53:20.282 --> 53:22.993
You didn't wanna wake me?
He didn't wanna wake me.

53:23.159 --> 53:26.246
Doesn't have a problem complaining
about Ernest Hemingway.

53:26.413 --> 53:28.574
He doesn't have a problem
asking for his wedding video.

53:28.623 --> 53:31.751
- Making crabby snacks, homemades.
- Come on, be nice.

53:31.918 --> 53:36.089
Come on, she's making crabby snacks
and homemades. Come on, Dad.

53:36.590 --> 53:38.842
What are you...?
What are you so up about?

53:39.009 --> 53:40.427
- - Very happy.
- I'm happy.

53:40.594 --> 53:42.888
- You're so up.
- Isn't that a good thing?

53:43.054 --> 53:45.390
You're just up.
I don't know what that is.

53:45.557 --> 53:48.393
Are you taking the proper dosage
of your medication?

53:48.560 --> 53:50.937
Am I taking the right dose?
Of course I am.

53:51.104 --> 53:56.192
- Taking a little too many or something?
- If I was taking that, I'd be on the floor.

53:56.359 --> 53:58.945
Stay. Stay for the game.
Spend some family time.

53:59.112 --> 54:02.032
Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to go.
What do you mean?

54:02.198 --> 54:03.825
You mean OCD superstitious time?

54:03.992 --> 54:06.286
Come on,
your dad needs a winner.

54:06.453 --> 54:07.954
- Come on.
- I can't.

54:08.121 --> 54:11.499
It's the Seahawks.
Put on the jersey and stay, please.

54:11.666 --> 54:14.544
Please. It's important, please.

54:14.711 --> 54:16.671
- - What are you up to?
- Nothing.

54:16.838 --> 54:18.298
What's in the envelope?

54:18.465 --> 54:20.592
Yeah, what...?
What's in that envelope?

54:20.759 --> 54:23.136
I'm beating the song.
I'm on the scoreboard.

54:23.303 --> 54:26.181
I'm playing downfield. I feel great.

54:30.143 --> 54:31.561
Tiffany.

54:40.070 --> 54:42.989
Hey, hey, how you doing?
Is Tiffany here?

54:43.156 --> 54:45.450
- What do you want?
- - That another creep?

54:45.617 --> 54:48.703
- What do you want, creep? Beat it.
- No, I'm married.

54:48.870 --> 54:51.539
- Married creep.
- I'm her friend. We go running.

54:51.706 --> 54:54.209
- Have you guys not seen?
- - She's not here.

54:54.376 --> 54:56.378
How's it going? Hey.
Is Tiffany home?

54:56.544 --> 54:59.005
- Go away.
- I know her. I know her.

54:59.172 --> 55:02.342
We've dated. We still date.
I've called her, texted her.

55:02.509 --> 55:05.011
I haven't heard back.
Used to work together...

55:05.178 --> 55:07.597
I just wanna give you my card
to give to her.

55:07.764 --> 55:10.642
- What's he saying?
- He's saying you're being rude.

55:10.809 --> 55:12.644
- How am I being rude?
- You know.

55:12.811 --> 55:15.647
Sometimes it's OK with girls,
they wanna have fun.

55:15.814 --> 55:19.484
Sometimes it's not, they got
a broken wing, they're an easy target.

55:19.651 --> 55:23.822
In this particular case, I think that
that wing is being fixed, my friend.

55:23.989 --> 55:27.242
Make sure it gets mended.
You're getting in the way of that.

55:27.409 --> 55:29.285
She's sensitive, smart, artistic.

55:29.452 --> 55:31.913
This is a great girl.
Be respectful to that.

55:32.080 --> 55:35.583
Let me walk you down to your car.
You're a better guy than this.

55:35.750 --> 55:37.794
She just texted me.

55:46.553 --> 55:50.932
Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a second.
What are you doing? What happened?

55:51.099 --> 55:53.893
- You weren't outside.
- I can't... I can't do it.

55:54.060 --> 55:57.313
- What do you mean?
- I can't give the letter to Nikki.

55:57.480 --> 56:01.818
Tiffany, what are you talking about?
What do you mean, can't give the letter?

56:01.985 --> 56:04.362
Because what am I getting in return?

56:04.529 --> 56:07.365
You said if I wrote a letter,
you'd get it to Nikki.

56:07.532 --> 56:11.870
Because I do this. Time after time,
I do all this shit for other people.

56:12.037 --> 56:15.665
And then I wake up and I'm empty,
I have nothing.

56:15.832 --> 56:18.168
You seem like you're a tough girl
to me.

56:18.334 --> 56:22.338
- You do things on your own.
- I always get myself in these situations.

56:22.505 --> 56:25.550
I give everything to other people
and nobody ever...

56:25.717 --> 56:28.219
I don't get what I want, OK?

56:28.386 --> 56:29.888
I'm not my sister.

56:35.143 --> 56:38.396
All right, well, ask for you.
What can I do for you?

56:39.522 --> 56:41.649
I... I can't do it.

56:41.816 --> 56:44.652
Tiffany, what do you want me to do?

56:45.403 --> 56:47.989
- Think of something.
- There's this thing.

56:48.156 --> 56:50.492
There's a thing.
OK, what kind of thing?

56:51.242 --> 56:52.869
It's a thing. It's a thing.

56:53.036 --> 56:55.580
- It's a dance thing.
- Dance thing, all right.

56:55.747 --> 56:58.958
Competition at the Franklin Hotel.
Tommy would never do it.

56:59.125 --> 57:01.461
Tommy's dead,
he's not gonna fucking do it.

57:01.628 --> 57:03.505
I don't have a filter when I talk.

57:03.671 --> 57:06.841
Can we have one
conversation without you reminding me?

57:07.008 --> 57:09.302
- OK, I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

57:09.469 --> 57:14.265
But I can only do it if I have a partner.
I'm about to miss it for another year.

57:14.432 --> 57:17.018
I'm not gonna dance.
What are you talking about?

57:17.185 --> 57:21.356
Your schedule is busy? <i>Grapes of Wrath</i>
and watching football with your dad?

57:21.523 --> 57:24.609
- I'm not gonna do a dance.
- I'm not giving your letter.

57:24.776 --> 57:26.486
You promised you would do this.

57:26.986 --> 57:28.404
Think about it.

57:29.114 --> 57:31.157
I already did do something for you.

57:31.324 --> 57:35.286
- What did you do for me?
- Took care of that jerkoff at your house.

57:35.453 --> 57:37.288
- What? Jordie?
- Let me ask you,

57:37.455 --> 57:39.457
you call him when you're lonely?

57:40.625 --> 57:44.420
- That encourages him. Shouldn't do it.
- Say the same about Nikki?

57:44.587 --> 57:48.716
Not at all like me and Nikki.
We're in love and married. It's different.

57:48.883 --> 57:51.970
How are you in love?
Tell me about that.

57:52.262 --> 57:56.349
The big Nikki love. Tell me about it.
I wanna understand it.

57:56.516 --> 58:00.645
We have an unconventional chemistry.
Makes people feel awkward, but not me.

58:00.812 --> 58:03.064
She's the most beautiful woman
I've ever been with.

58:03.231 --> 58:05.775
- Wow.
- It's electric between us.

58:05.942 --> 58:09.821
Yeah, we wanna change each other, but
that's normal. Couples wanna do that.

58:09.988 --> 58:14.492
I want her to stop dressing like she
dresses, stop acting so superior to me.

58:14.659 --> 58:18.329
She wanted me to lose weight,
stop my mood swings, which I've done.

58:18.496 --> 58:20.290
People fight. Couples fight.

58:20.456 --> 58:23.376
We would fight,
we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks.

58:23.543 --> 58:27.380
She wanted the best. She wanted me
to be passionate and compassionate.

58:27.547 --> 58:31.843
That's a good thing. I'm my best self
today and she's her best self today.

58:32.010 --> 58:33.553
Our love's gonna be amazing.

58:33.720 --> 58:36.598
You're gonna be amazing
and she's gonna be amazing.

58:36.764 --> 58:39.267
You're not gonna take advantage
of a situation

58:39.434 --> 58:43.688
without offering to do something back.
So think about the dance thing.

58:46.357 --> 58:47.775
<i>...went on a roll.</i>

58:47.942 --> 58:50.320
<i>McNabb got not in the first half,
nine consecutive...</i>

58:50.486 --> 58:52.197
<i>You're out of the hospital?</i>

58:52.363 --> 58:55.116
- And you're here on game day?
- I'm out.

58:55.325 --> 58:59.537
It's official. They didn't convert me
to Mental Hygiene Law admission status

58:59.704 --> 59:03.791
within two-thirds of the maximum length
of my felony sentence, so I'm out.

59:03.958 --> 59:07.378
- They had to let me go.
- I never understand what he's saying.

59:07.545 --> 59:10.757
OK, jailhouse lawyer, come back,
sit down the way you were before.

59:10.924 --> 59:13.635
What a treat!
- - Let's do it.

59:13.801 --> 59:17.222
- - Dad's got you sitting here?
- He calls me "jailhouse lawyer."

59:17.388 --> 59:19.349
Hold the remote the way you were.

59:19.515 --> 59:23.269
- - Now you're holding the remote?
- It's working. Your dad's a genius.

59:23.436 --> 59:25.021
Now, sit up.

59:25.188 --> 59:27.565
- And Danny's good luck?
- Danny's from you.

59:27.732 --> 59:30.151
This is your house
so it comes down to you.

59:30.318 --> 59:32.737
- You're the one, Pat.
- - Superstition, Danny.

59:32.904 --> 59:37.033
Come sit down. Don't disappear doing
God knows what with Tiffany Maxwell.

59:37.200 --> 59:39.953
Dad, Dad. She's my friend.
Why would you say that?

59:40.245 --> 59:43.748
Oh, she's a mess. Gotta be careful.
She does a lot of therapy.

59:43.915 --> 59:45.875
I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie.

59:46.042 --> 59:47.794
- I'm saying...
- - Am I messed up?

59:47.961 --> 59:51.130
Stop judging. You're the one
who has a messed-up marriage.

59:51.297 --> 59:53.800
- I'm just looking out for you.
- What's wrong?

59:53.967 --> 59:55.385
Nothing's wrong.

59:55.551 --> 59:57.720
At his house, it's like a circus there.

59:57.887 --> 01:00:00.515
Not gonna hide this.
You need to deal with it.

01:00:00.848 --> 01:00:02.308
Stop breaking my balls.

01:00:02.475 --> 01:00:04.519
- I got you... I brought the iPod.
- Oh! Whoa.

01:00:04.686 --> 01:00:07.105
- For me?
- Yeah. That's my old iPod, but...

01:00:07.272 --> 01:00:09.482
Buddy, thank you.
That's so nice of you.

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:11.067
- Wow.
- Thirty-two gigabytes.

01:00:11.234 --> 01:00:13.111
- How many songs is that?
- 7,000.

01:00:13.486 --> 01:00:16.072
You got the Stranglers.
You love the Stranglers.

01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:19.617
- Oh, the Sex Pistols. The Clash.
- Got some Clash.

01:00:20.076 --> 01:00:21.661
<i>Oh, West Side Story.</i>

01:00:21.828 --> 01:00:24.080
- It makes me peaceful.
<i>- West Side Story?</i>

01:00:24.247 --> 01:00:25.748
â™ª Just met a girl named Maria â™ª

01:00:25.915 --> 01:00:30.253
And then when I'm angry, which is a lot
these days, I go to the garage.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.923
Metallica, Megadeth.

01:00:37.927 --> 01:00:39.721
I start fucking smashing shit.

01:00:39.887 --> 01:00:42.390
- Get your marriage together.
- Breaking shit.

01:00:42.557 --> 01:00:45.268
And I hurt my hand and I...

01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:48.396
- Ronnie, that's fucked up.
- It makes me feel better.

01:00:48.563 --> 01:00:49.981
It's like my therapy.

01:00:50.356 --> 01:00:53.109
With Nikki,
I'm never gonna do stuff like that.

01:00:53.276 --> 01:00:56.112
Whoa, Nikki?
What's all this about Nikki?

01:00:57.488 --> 01:01:00.283
Restraining order's
nothing to fool with, bro.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:03.369
Holy shit, look at you.
You are ripped.

01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:05.997
You look absolutely amazing.
You feel good?

01:01:06.164 --> 01:01:09.584
- How you doing, Jake?
- You look like Schwarzenegger. Shit.

01:01:09.751 --> 01:01:11.961
Didn't I say
you wouldn't recognise him?

01:01:12.337 --> 01:01:16.507
So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come
see you down at the hospital.

01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:20.136
Those places creep me out
and the firm's been expanded.

01:01:20.303 --> 01:01:24.223
Been helping Pop. He needs a legitimate
business. He needs a tax return.

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:27.393
The money he's making,
they're gonna come after him.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.730
And it looks like I'm gonna
make partner at the firm.

01:01:31.481 --> 01:01:34.067
I don't even know what to say
to you anymore.

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:35.818
You lost your wife,

01:01:36.361 --> 01:01:37.904
I'm getting engaged.

01:01:38.071 --> 01:01:41.074
I wanna be able to tell you
about those kind of things.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.286
You lost your house,
I'm getting a new house.

01:01:45.453 --> 01:01:48.623
You lost your job,
things are great for me at the firm.

01:01:49.165 --> 01:01:51.751
Stop talking about stuff
that's good for you.

01:01:51.918 --> 01:01:54.962
Leave it alone. Leave it alone.
We're watching the game.

01:01:55.129 --> 01:01:58.049
You know what?
I'm just gonna stop talking.

01:01:58.216 --> 01:02:00.259
I'm gonna shut my mouth.

01:02:03.596 --> 01:02:06.140
As my friend Danny would say:

01:02:11.604 --> 01:02:13.773
I got nothing but love for you,
brother.

01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:20.530
- That's right. That's right.
- That's nice.

01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:24.283
- - That's nice.
- Thank God, finally.

01:02:25.076 --> 01:02:27.537
- - DeSean Jackson.
- Yeah. Did it fit?

01:02:27.703 --> 01:02:31.416
- Yeah, wore it to Ronnie's.
- Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey.

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:34.585
- Veronica didn't like it.
- Veronica hates the jersey.

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:37.922
Whatever you do, watch out
for that restraining order, OK?

01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:41.634
- Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble.
- You're up to something.

01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:46.013
People like Tiffany, or Danny or me, we
know something you don't know, OK?

01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:50.059
Maybe we understand something
because we're more...

01:02:50.226 --> 01:02:53.604
We have a sixth sense.
Everybody got it. Just not in touch.

01:02:53.771 --> 01:02:55.690
- How you doing, Pat?
- Jesus.

01:02:55.857 --> 01:02:58.568
Sixth sense forgot to tell him
cops were coming.

01:02:58.734 --> 01:03:02.321
- I'm taking him back to the hospital.
- What? He passed, right?

01:03:02.488 --> 01:03:05.533
First of all, check with
the latest legal development.

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:09.787
Got a call that they did convert you to
Mental Hygiene Law admission status

01:03:09.954 --> 01:03:11.372
by the deadline.

01:03:11.539 --> 01:03:14.417
Wait a minute.
Are you an Eagles fan or are you not?

01:03:14.584 --> 01:03:16.836
- - I'm an Eagles fan.
- What's the problem?

01:03:17.003 --> 01:03:19.672
He's not going anywhere.
Let him finish the game.

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:23.134
Handkerchief is working.
We're killing the Seahawks, 27-10.

01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:26.429
What's the matter with you?
Let him stay, please.

01:03:26.596 --> 01:03:28.598
Don't know
what you're talking about.

01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:31.434
I'm glad the Seahawks are losing,
we're winning,

01:03:31.601 --> 01:03:34.979
but I gotta take Danny McDaniels
back to Baltimore, all right?

01:03:35.146 --> 01:03:38.149
He can contest his case
from Baltimore.

01:03:38.316 --> 01:03:41.861
Not correct about the Mental
Hygiene Law. You're not correct.

01:03:42.195 --> 01:03:44.989
You guys ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

01:04:02.507 --> 01:04:05.009
Used insurance money
to build this. I designed it.

01:04:05.176 --> 01:04:06.761
- Wow.
- All the floors are hard oak.

01:04:06.928 --> 01:04:09.096
It has good bounce for dancers.

01:04:09.263 --> 01:04:13.434
I'm not that great of a dancer,
but who cares? It's therapy and it's fun.

01:04:13.601 --> 01:04:17.355
Walls are good, I can play music
really loud without anybody hearing.

01:04:17.522 --> 01:04:19.357
- Where do you sleep?
- Upstairs.

01:04:19.524 --> 01:04:24.320
It's a garage, I just renovated it.
Thinking about putting a ballet barre...

01:04:24.487 --> 01:04:26.405
When are you gonna give it to her?

01:04:27.156 --> 01:04:28.658
What?

01:04:29.283 --> 01:04:31.285
The letter to Nikki.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.539
- Probably tonight.
- Really?

01:04:34.705 --> 01:04:37.291
Ronnie, Veronica and I,
we'll see her tonight.

01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:41.045
I changed the first paragraph.
I did this thing about Shakespeare,

01:04:41.212 --> 01:04:45.216
and maybe if she wanted to go dancing,
I can be able to do that.

01:04:45.383 --> 01:04:47.885
- Good.
- I assume you're a good teacher.

01:04:48.052 --> 01:04:49.762
- Yeah.
- You can teach us both.

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:51.931
And I also mentioned how you were...

01:04:52.098 --> 01:04:54.225
How generous it is,
what I'm doing for you.

01:04:54.392 --> 01:04:56.686
- Mm-hm. Really generous.
- Being of service.

01:04:56.852 --> 01:04:58.604
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- To your need.

01:04:58.771 --> 01:05:02.275
All right, start simple.
Start at that corner, walk towards me.

01:05:02.441 --> 01:05:04.402
Walk across the room.

01:05:04.569 --> 01:05:07.738
- Can we do something besides dance?
- Are you kidding me?

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:10.366
- Want me to fix something?
- Deal is a deal.

01:05:10.533 --> 01:05:14.829
I know, OK. I was just suggesting
that maybe there's a better scenario.

01:05:14.996 --> 01:05:16.872
Why don't you...

01:05:17.456 --> 01:05:20.626
...walk towards me like I'm Nikki?

01:05:20.793 --> 01:05:24.338
The only way to convey how much
you've missed me is by your walk.

01:05:24.505 --> 01:05:28.092
By your slow walk. You can't talk.

01:05:28.259 --> 01:05:30.136
- Not doing it.
- Only walk. Do it.

01:05:30.303 --> 01:05:31.762
No. That's stupid.

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:33.973
No walk, no letter.

01:05:35.474 --> 01:05:39.228
Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on.
Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.

01:05:39.395 --> 01:05:41.272
You're not Nikki.

01:05:42.648 --> 01:05:45.443
Don't look up
until you're halfway here.

01:05:46.861 --> 01:05:48.321
That's right.

01:05:48.654 --> 01:05:50.406
Not yet.

01:05:54.285 --> 01:05:56.162
Yes.

01:05:57.997 --> 01:06:00.958
Do you feel that? That's emotion.

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:02.543
I don't feel anything.

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:08.633
Has anybody ever told you
how Tommy died?

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:12.219
No.

01:06:13.679 --> 01:06:17.516
We were married for three years
and five days, and I loved him.

01:06:17.808 --> 01:06:21.187
But for the last couple months,
I just wasn't into sex at all.

01:06:21.354 --> 01:06:24.982
It just felt like we were so different
and I was depressed.

01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:28.736
Some of that is just me, some of it
was he wanted me to have kids.

01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:31.113
I have a hard time
taking care of myself.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.366
I don't think
that makes me a criminal.

01:06:36.577 --> 01:06:40.289
Anyway, one night after dinner,

01:06:40.665 --> 01:06:44.251
he drove to Victoria's Secret
at King of Prussia Mall

01:06:45.044 --> 01:06:47.963
and got some lingerie
to get something going.

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:50.132
And on the way back,
he stopped on 76

01:06:50.299 --> 01:06:54.679
to help a guy with a flat tyre
and he got hit by a car and killed.

01:06:55.346 --> 01:06:58.766
And the Victoria's Secret box
was still in the front seat.

01:07:03.062 --> 01:07:05.106
That's a feeling.

01:07:54.196 --> 01:07:57.450
OK, this is the waltz.
I'm gonna teach you the waltz step.

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:54.692
- Whoa, slow down.
- What?

01:09:54.859 --> 01:09:57.820
Your father wanted you to have this.

01:09:58.696 --> 01:10:00.656
Wants me to have
Eagles information.

01:10:00.823 --> 01:10:02.241
It's his living.

01:10:02.408 --> 01:10:05.119
Um, tell Dad thanks.

01:10:05.286 --> 01:10:08.497
Your father expects
to spend time with you, Pat.

01:10:14.378 --> 01:10:17.882
Football stays out of this place.
So does Lord of the Flies.

01:10:18.048 --> 01:10:20.634
What are you doing?
I'm behind on my syllabus.

01:10:20.801 --> 01:10:22.303
I don't give a fuck.

01:10:22.469 --> 01:10:25.222
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, hey!

01:10:25.389 --> 01:10:29.101
- Did you throw that outside?
- You're not gonna read that on my time.

01:10:29.268 --> 01:10:31.437
<i>I can tell you about Lord of the Flies.</i>

01:10:31.604 --> 01:10:35.232
It's a bunch of boys on an island
and they have a conch, a shell,

01:10:35.399 --> 01:10:38.068
and whoever has the conch
has power and can talk.

01:10:38.235 --> 01:10:40.571
You don't have the conch,
don't have power.

01:10:40.738 --> 01:10:43.032
Then there's a little chubby boy,
Piggy,

01:10:43.198 --> 01:10:45.618
and they're mean,
and then there's a murder.

01:10:45.784 --> 01:10:49.204
I mean, humanity is just nasty
and there's no silver lining.

01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:52.207
Wow. That was a great synopsis.
I still need to read it, though.

01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:55.377
Who's that?

01:10:55.544 --> 01:10:58.422
Hello? What the...?
What are you doing here, man?

01:10:58.589 --> 01:11:02.343
If one of your two supervising
physicians loses their license,

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:04.637
your whole adjudication
is thrown out.

01:11:04.845 --> 01:11:07.348
- How'd you know we were here?
- Your parents.

01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:10.976
- Danny, Tiffany. Tiffany, Danny.
- Pat told me about you.

01:11:11.143 --> 01:11:13.604
- Is this the girl you wrote about?
- - Yeah.

01:11:13.771 --> 01:11:15.898
You wrote about me? I'm "the girl"?

01:11:16.065 --> 01:11:18.108
- He wrote about you.
- What did he say?

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:20.277
You was helping
each other out

01:11:20.444 --> 01:11:23.948
and you were nice.
And you had a mouth on you, but...

01:11:24.114 --> 01:11:26.158
- Whoa, OK, OK.
- - A little mouthy.

01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:30.245
- Tell me more about what he said.
- I'll just tell you.

01:11:30.412 --> 01:11:32.873
- It was just a very general letter.
- Cool.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.626
- - She's fine.
- She is my friend with an F.

01:11:35.793 --> 01:11:38.712
- A capital F. She's fine.
- For "friend."

01:11:38.879 --> 01:11:41.256
Mm. Can I see
what you guys are doing?

01:11:41.423 --> 01:11:42.841
Yeah.

01:11:43.175 --> 01:11:45.678
- One, two.
- - I like it, I like it.

01:11:45.844 --> 01:11:47.346
- Do you?
- - It's good, yeah.

01:11:47.513 --> 01:11:50.140
And then this goes
into something else.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:53.060
- That's it?
- What is it? What is it? What is it?

01:11:53.227 --> 01:11:54.812
- Can I say something?
- - No.

01:11:54.979 --> 01:11:56.438
- You sure?
- Just say it.

01:11:56.605 --> 01:11:59.274
I think, Pat,
you should be facing Tiffany.

01:12:00.234 --> 01:12:04.196
Let me show you what I mean. You
gotta come with a little bit more soul.

01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:07.574
You should move some more hips.
Pat, come in like this.

01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:09.243
OK.

01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:11.662
Yeah. Can you move
a little bit more hip?

01:12:11.829 --> 01:12:13.455
That's it. Move a bit more.

01:12:13.622 --> 01:12:16.917
You could turn around too.
Yeah. You're pretty good.

01:12:17.668 --> 01:12:19.294
Yeah. Exactly.

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:23.048
- Yeah.
- OK, we got it, we got it.

01:12:23.215 --> 01:12:26.218
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it.
- I'll switch with you.

01:12:27.219 --> 01:12:28.971
Come on, Pat. Come on.

01:12:29.513 --> 01:12:31.724
A little bit more soul, Pat.

01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:34.184
- Black it up, Pat.
- What's that mean?

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:36.645
- - You know what it means.
- "Black it up"?

01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:41.233
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Oh, man. I got an idea.

01:12:44.319 --> 01:12:47.531
Jump up. Hold hands. Circle around
and around and around.

01:12:47.698 --> 01:12:49.116
Don't look back.

01:12:50.951 --> 01:12:52.953
Come get some, Pat.

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:56.331
- Is that it?
- That's it.

01:12:56.623 --> 01:12:59.460
Bounce, bounce. Shuffle back,
shuffle, shuffle.

01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:02.546
Shuffle back, shuffle back.
You gotta move your junk.

01:13:02.713 --> 01:13:04.590
Pop. Pop your butt. Pop it.

01:13:04.757 --> 01:13:07.593
I gotta get out of here.
Gotta see this girl, Tanya.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.803
- Yeah, go see Tanya.
- OK, man, hey.

01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:11.889
I'll be there. I want you to win.

01:13:12.056 --> 01:13:13.849
- Excelsior, Pat.
- - Excelsior.

01:13:14.016 --> 01:13:16.143
That's my man. Let's go.

01:13:17.144 --> 01:13:18.562
<i>Patty.</i>

01:13:19.813 --> 01:13:21.315
Patty.

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:37.956
Hey. Patty.

01:13:38.123 --> 01:13:39.625
Pat.

01:13:40.209 --> 01:13:42.586
Huh? Patty.

01:13:43.754 --> 01:13:47.174
Where have you been? Huh?

01:13:47.341 --> 01:13:50.344
We got a serious situation
on our hands, you know that.

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:57.351
We gotta beat the Giants if we wanna
have a chance of getting into division,

01:13:57.518 --> 01:13:59.686
any chance of playing
in the playoffs.

01:13:59.853 --> 01:14:01.522
Do you realise that?

01:14:01.688 --> 01:14:04.316
Ahem. I didn't realise that.

01:14:04.483 --> 01:14:06.777
Yeah, that's the bind we're in.

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:11.448
I mean, I think it would be wise
if we spent father-son time

01:14:11.615 --> 01:14:14.743
reading about the Eagles,
talking about them,

01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:17.871
just to strengthen the good-luck thing
that you're in.

01:14:18.872 --> 01:14:20.999
- OK.
- Yeah?

01:14:24.044 --> 01:14:25.754
- Right.
- Hm?

01:14:35.848 --> 01:14:38.142
I just wanted to, uh...

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.854
Maybe I didn't

01:14:42.563 --> 01:14:45.023
spend enough time
with you growing up.

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:47.734
I spent too much time
with your brother.

01:14:49.194 --> 01:14:53.323
It might've made you feel worse
about your behaviour,

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:56.493
but I didn't know anything.
I didn't know how to handle it.

01:14:57.744 --> 01:15:00.164
That's what all this Eagles stuff
is about.

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:04.459
It's about us spending time now.

01:15:08.714 --> 01:15:12.217
I wanna do everything I can
to help you get back on your feet.

01:15:12.384 --> 01:15:15.053
That's the whole point.

01:15:16.054 --> 01:15:17.556
Yeah.

01:15:19.057 --> 01:15:21.185
I wish you'd watch these games
with me

01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:25.856
so we could talk,
we could get into things.

01:15:31.904 --> 01:15:36.283
So, look, will you just come downstairs
and talk to me and Randy now, huh?

01:15:37.201 --> 01:15:39.494
Randy, tell him what I'm doing.

01:15:39.661 --> 01:15:42.623
He's betting everything
on the Giant game. Everything.

01:15:42.789 --> 01:15:44.875
The money he needs
for the restaurant,

01:15:45.042 --> 01:15:47.753
- he's betting on the Giant game.
- - Tell him why.

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.839
Because he believes in you.

01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:54.426
- Is that true?
- - I believe in you, Patty.

01:15:54.593 --> 01:15:56.053
I believe in you.

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.930
I want you to know that.

01:15:58.096 --> 01:16:00.098
So I'm gonna bet heavy
on this game.

01:16:01.058 --> 01:16:02.476
- You understand?
- - Yeah.

01:16:02.643 --> 01:16:05.604
Heavy. I want you to go
to the game with your brother.

01:16:05.938 --> 01:16:08.857
- Want me to go to the game with Jake?
- I do.

01:16:09.024 --> 01:16:11.276
- Does he want me to go?
- Of course.

01:16:11.443 --> 01:16:13.904
- He told you that?
- He told me, yes.

01:16:14.196 --> 01:16:17.115
- With his friends?
- With his friends. He trusts you.

01:16:17.282 --> 01:16:18.825
- He's not embarrassed?
- No.

01:16:18.992 --> 01:16:22.496
I'd love to go to the game too,
but I'm banned from the stadium.

01:16:22.663 --> 01:16:24.539
I'd love to see us beat the Giants

01:16:24.706 --> 01:16:27.167
and take a lot of money
from this asshole.

01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:29.169
Listen, personally,

01:16:29.336 --> 01:16:31.838
- I think it's a stupid bet.
- Randy.

01:16:32.005 --> 01:16:36.343
I think it's ridiculous to bet all that
dough for the restaurant on a game.

01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:39.888
Randy. I just hope
you heard what I said.

01:16:40.055 --> 01:16:43.809
It's like a family business,
it's our family endeavour.

01:16:43.976 --> 01:16:46.770
We all stick together on this.
That's how it works.

01:16:46.937 --> 01:16:50.524
That's a positive, positive vibe.

01:16:52.484 --> 01:16:54.653
I made a commitment
about a project,

01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:58.991
and we have an important part of it that
we have to go over on Sunday, so...

01:17:00.909 --> 01:17:02.744
I... I'm...

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.997
It's... And it's good for me, Dad.

01:17:05.163 --> 01:17:08.000
It's making me disciplined
and focused, and it's...

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:10.919
Never would've thought this,
but it's a good thing.

01:17:11.086 --> 01:17:12.921
What is this thing you're doing?

01:17:13.088 --> 01:17:15.924
Yeah, what is it?
What is this project, hon?

01:17:16.091 --> 01:17:17.676
It's a dance thing, OK?

01:17:18.176 --> 01:17:19.928
There's nothing more to it, Dad.

01:17:20.554 --> 01:17:22.222
I swear.

01:17:33.191 --> 01:17:35.193
Listen, I need to ask you something.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.738
Tomorrow, can I spend
half the day with you?

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.700
- I'm gonna pretend that you didn't ask.
- Why?

01:17:41.867 --> 01:17:44.703
These are the two days
that you have promised me

01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:47.122
and we have prepared
to nail the big move.

01:17:47.289 --> 01:17:49.624
It's not ready yet,
we don't have the move.

01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:53.879
My dad opened up, and it was beautiful
and I wanna be of service to him.

01:17:54.046 --> 01:17:58.216
He's worried the juju is being fucked up
because I'm spending time with you.

01:17:58.383 --> 01:18:00.218
Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?

01:18:00.385 --> 01:18:02.929
You're not messing it up,
the juju is messed up

01:18:03.096 --> 01:18:05.932
because I'm not with him
during the games.

01:18:06.308 --> 01:18:08.018
- Guess what.
- What?

01:18:08.185 --> 01:18:10.645
Nikki replied to your letter.

01:18:14.608 --> 01:18:18.320
But you can't read it
until after you nail the big move.

01:18:18.487 --> 01:18:20.405
Go.

01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:41.635
I can't do anything else
till I can read Nikki's letter.

01:18:41.802 --> 01:18:45.305
It's in the back of my head.
We don't almost have it, all right?

01:18:45.931 --> 01:18:49.059
- - I just hope you can handle it.
- Thank you.

01:18:49.976 --> 01:18:52.646
What was her energy
when she gave it to you?

01:18:53.105 --> 01:18:56.691
She was intrigued, excited,
and a little scared.

01:18:57.526 --> 01:19:00.487
She was scared? About what?
Did she tell you?

01:19:04.408 --> 01:19:06.868
Try to stay positive.

01:19:10.372 --> 01:19:14.709
I'm just gonna read it out loud, OK?
Because if she says anything that's...

01:19:14.876 --> 01:19:17.337
- Is that too much to ask?
- No.

01:19:24.344 --> 01:19:28.557
- I thought you were gonna read it.
- OK. I'm sorry.

01:19:29.015 --> 01:19:31.101
"Dear Pat." Ahem.

01:19:32.686 --> 01:19:36.690
"It was very emotional for me
to get your letter, as you can imagine,

01:19:36.857 --> 01:19:40.652
but I'm glad you took the risk
of getting it to me through Tiffany."

01:19:41.027 --> 01:19:43.113
"This gives us a chance
to communicate

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.741
while I keep the restraining order
until I feel safe."

01:19:49.119 --> 01:19:52.706
"I admit you sound terrific
and I'm happy you're feeling positive

01:19:52.873 --> 01:19:57.419
and becoming a more loving and caring
man, which I always knew you were."

01:20:12.726 --> 01:20:16.104
"I was moved to read about excelsior
and your belief in happy endings."

01:20:16.271 --> 01:20:19.191
"I'm moved by your act of love
to read books I taught."

01:20:19.357 --> 01:20:21.234
"I'm sorry you find them negative."

01:20:21.401 --> 01:20:24.404
"They're great works that reflect
how hard life can be."

01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:28.074
"They can help kids prepare
themselves for the hardness of life."

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:30.368
"In spite of these developments,

01:20:30.535 --> 01:20:34.206
if it's me reading the signs,
I need to see something

01:20:34.372 --> 01:20:37.042
to prove you are ready
to resume our marriage."

01:20:37.209 --> 01:20:39.920
"Otherwise, I find myself thinking that

01:20:40.962 --> 01:20:44.758
we might both be better off moving on
with our lives separately."

01:20:51.306 --> 01:20:54.809
"Don't react quickly to this,
but take time to think about it."

01:20:56.311 --> 01:20:59.564
"I'm glad you're doing so well.
Love, Nikki."

01:21:10.742 --> 01:21:13.078
I think I'm done today, OK?

01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:22.587
She said to show her something, Pat.
This dance can be that something.

01:21:22.754 --> 01:21:26.174
You would've never done something
like this in a million years.

01:21:26.341 --> 01:21:29.177
It shows all kinds of skills
on so many levels,

01:21:29.344 --> 01:21:32.264
focus, collaboration, discipline.

01:21:33.682 --> 01:21:36.851
It's romantic, like I said it would be.

01:21:37.769 --> 01:21:39.563
It's for her.

01:21:41.022 --> 01:21:44.192
Thanks for the letter.
I'll see you tomorrow, OK?

01:21:50.615 --> 01:21:54.327
E-A-G-L-E-S!

01:21:54.494 --> 01:21:55.912
Eagles!

01:21:57.205 --> 01:21:58.623
<i>Can I use your phone?</i>

01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:01.001
- Is it an emergency?
- Yeah, kind of.

01:22:01.167 --> 01:22:03.295
What kind of emergency?

01:22:03.670 --> 01:22:08.174
I'm doing this project with Tiffany. I
wanna tell her I'm not gonna be on time.

01:22:08.341 --> 01:22:11.052
Just don't make her an emergency,
that crazy girl.

01:22:11.219 --> 01:22:14.472
I'm... She's...
I'll just borrow Jake's phone.

01:22:14.639 --> 01:22:17.851
Too bad you can't come,
but I know you were kicked out,

01:22:18.018 --> 01:22:19.769
beating everybody up.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.939
Guess we're not that different,
huh, Dad?

01:22:24.024 --> 01:22:25.442
That a bad thing?

01:22:25.609 --> 01:22:27.986
No, I think it's a good thing.

01:22:28.987 --> 01:22:31.531
Don't drink, don't hit anybody.
You'll be fine.

01:22:31.698 --> 01:22:34.075
Yeah. I'm solid.

01:22:40.624 --> 01:22:43.209
- This is my brother Pat.
- How you doing? Pat.

01:22:43.376 --> 01:22:46.254
Pat, what's this I hear
about you just getting out?

01:22:46.421 --> 01:22:48.340
Yeah! From the loony bin!

01:22:48.506 --> 01:22:51.134
Guys, what the fuck?
I talked to you about that.

01:22:51.301 --> 01:22:53.553
- I told you.
- It's all right.

01:22:54.179 --> 01:22:58.224
He's a good dude. He's a good dude.
Yeah!

01:23:00.101 --> 01:23:03.146
Oh, shit. The Asian invasion.

01:23:03.688 --> 01:23:05.482
Every week.

01:23:06.650 --> 01:23:09.194
That's right, fool. We got this.

01:23:14.908 --> 01:23:16.451
No.

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:20.205
- You better get your brother.
- Cuckoo bird's taking off.

01:23:20.372 --> 01:23:22.332
- - Cuckoo bird!
- Dr Patel.

01:23:23.917 --> 01:23:26.753
- Hey, Pat! Hey.
- Hey.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.338
What are you doing here?

01:23:28.505 --> 01:23:31.383
- We must beat the Giants.
- Not supposed to see you.

01:23:31.549 --> 01:23:33.218
Outside the office.

01:23:33.385 --> 01:23:36.096
- Is that illegal?
- I'm your brother in green,

01:23:36.262 --> 01:23:38.556
not your therapist.
I'm happy to see you.

01:23:38.723 --> 01:23:40.392
Wonderful that you are here.

01:23:40.558 --> 01:23:42.268
This is Cliff. My doctor.

01:23:42.435 --> 01:23:46.398
Two things. Watch that bubble screen
for Manning in the backfield

01:23:46.564 --> 01:23:49.651
and make sure we knock
the receivers on their ass.

01:23:49.818 --> 01:23:51.736
You can say that again.
Those cocksuckers!

01:24:20.432 --> 01:24:22.267
I don't have her phone number.

01:24:22.434 --> 01:24:25.729
If you really want, you can call
Veronica because she does,

01:24:25.895 --> 01:24:27.522
- but I don't wanna.
- - Why?

01:24:27.689 --> 01:24:30.316
Because she brings me down!
She brings me down.

01:24:30.483 --> 01:24:34.154
You're not gonna throw the marriage
away. There's some love there.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.533
You guys have a thing that got broken.
You gotta fix it like a chiropractor.

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:40.910
Gotta give it
a chiropractic adjustment.

01:24:41.077 --> 01:24:42.579
Enough with awkwardness!

01:24:42.746 --> 01:24:45.623
I don't wanna not be able
to say what I wanna say.

01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:47.375
You're right, you're right.

01:24:47.542 --> 01:24:49.627
Whoo! Eagles, baby!

01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:51.713
Yeah! Let's go! Whoo!

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.924
- What the fuck? What's that smell?
- What the hell?

01:24:55.091 --> 01:24:56.968
Nasty Indian curry.

01:24:57.135 --> 01:24:58.678
This is America, baby.

01:24:58.845 --> 01:25:00.305
Go back to your country.

01:25:00.555 --> 01:25:02.390
- Get out of here!
- What's wrong?

01:25:02.557 --> 01:25:04.392
Hey. Hey.

01:25:05.393 --> 01:25:06.811
What's going on?

01:25:06.978 --> 01:25:08.730
Stay back, Pat. Stay back.

01:25:08.897 --> 01:25:10.774
Leave the fucking Indians alone.

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.484
- Tough guy.
- - A traitor.

01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:15.195
- Stay here. Stay here.
- I'm not gonna go in.

01:25:15.361 --> 01:25:17.155
- They're cool!
- - Let's go!

01:25:17.572 --> 01:25:20.575
I'm not gonna fight,
I'm not gonna fight.

01:25:21.284 --> 01:25:22.869
We're the real Eagle fans.

01:25:23.244 --> 01:25:24.954
Not my brother! Hey, hey, hey!

01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:27.415
- Come on, get him!
- Get off my brother!

01:25:27.582 --> 01:25:29.459
Break it up
or you'll be arrested!

01:25:29.626 --> 01:25:31.044
Pat. Pat. Pat.

01:25:51.356 --> 01:25:54.150
What'd you do? What happened?

01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:56.736
- - Dad. Dad.
- What happened?

01:25:57.362 --> 01:26:00.698
The Birds lose, I lose a fucking fortune.
A fortune to Randy.

01:26:00.865 --> 01:26:03.076
What did you do? You fucking lost it.

01:26:03.243 --> 01:26:05.703
You said you had it together,
you were solid.

01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:09.165
I am solid. I was solid at the game.
I'm solid. I'm solid.

01:26:09.332 --> 01:26:11.793
You fell apart!
What are you talking about?

01:26:13.086 --> 01:26:15.505
It's all fucking ruined now.
It's all ruined.

01:26:15.672 --> 01:26:17.465
- It's all ruined!
- - No, Dad.

01:26:17.632 --> 01:26:19.676
- It's ruined! It's ruined!
- - No, Dad.

01:26:19.843 --> 01:26:22.846
You little fucking shit!

01:26:23.012 --> 01:26:25.807
- - Come on, Dad!
- You fucking loser! You loser!

01:26:25.974 --> 01:26:30.562
- - I'm not a loser.
- You fucking loser! Spiked the ball...

01:26:30.728 --> 01:26:32.313
He defended his brother
and us.

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.400
- Spiked the ball at the one-yard line.
- - No, Dad.

01:26:37.819 --> 01:26:40.071
- - Who is this?
- We need to talk now.

01:26:40.238 --> 01:26:43.783
When you make a commitment,
it is not cool to not show up!

01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:45.451
Wait. I tried to call.

01:26:45.618 --> 01:26:47.078
- My God.
- Who is this?

01:26:47.245 --> 01:26:49.873
- I tried to call you, Tiffany.
- Oh, really?

01:26:50.039 --> 01:26:52.542
I was gonna split my time
with my dad and you.

01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:55.753
- Dad was pulling me in one direction.
- Sounds great.

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.798
That's great for all of them,
but all of them

01:26:58.965 --> 01:27:02.468
didn't make a commitment to me
in return for my help.

01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:05.597
I'm Tiffany, by the way.

01:27:07.974 --> 01:27:10.476
What is this craziness
with Tiffany Maxwell?

01:27:10.643 --> 01:27:13.354
No craziness.
I told you I was doing this thing.

01:27:13.521 --> 01:27:16.524
When you started
spending time with her, it fell apart.

01:27:16.691 --> 01:27:20.528
- This is the reason right here.
- Think I fucked up the Eagles' juju?

01:27:20.695 --> 01:27:23.489
Ever since.
Ever since he was with you. Since...

01:27:23.656 --> 01:27:27.160
- Think I'm why today's happened?
- - You are why today happened.

01:27:27.327 --> 01:27:29.579
- I'm why today happened?
- - I think so.

01:27:29.746 --> 01:27:32.248
- Let's talk about that.
- Be my guest.

01:27:32.415 --> 01:27:34.334
The first night that Pat and I met,

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.754
the Eagles beat the 49ers handily,
40 to 26.

01:27:37.921 --> 01:27:39.797
The second time we got together,

01:27:39.964 --> 01:27:42.634
the Phillies beat the Dodgers
7 to 5 in the NLCS.

01:27:43.176 --> 01:27:45.678
- - She's right.
- Next time we went for a run,

01:27:45.845 --> 01:27:49.349
the Eagles beat the Falcons, 27 to 14.

01:27:49.515 --> 01:27:53.144
The third time we got together,
we had Raisin Bran in the diner.

01:27:53.311 --> 01:27:57.231
Phillies dominated Tampa Bay, fourth
game of the World Series, 10 to 2.

01:27:57.398 --> 01:28:00.735
- - Oh, wow.
- Let me think about that. Wait a minute.

01:28:00.902 --> 01:28:04.322
Why not think about when the Eagles
beat the Seahawks, 14 to 7?

01:28:04.489 --> 01:28:07.241
- He was with you?
- - He was. We went for a run.

01:28:07.492 --> 01:28:11.496
There have been no games since Pat
and I have been rehearsing every day.

01:28:11.663 --> 01:28:14.666
And if Pat had been with me
like he was supposed to,

01:28:14.832 --> 01:28:16.834
he wouldn't have gotten in a fight,

01:28:17.001 --> 01:28:19.253
maybe the Eagles beat
the New York Giants.

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:24.676
She's making a lot of sense, Pop.
That's all right on all counts.

01:28:25.635 --> 01:28:29.514
Does anybody here happen to know
what the official motto of New York is

01:28:29.681 --> 01:28:32.183
on the official seal
of the state of New York?

01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:34.435
- Anybody? Do you know?
- No.

01:28:34.602 --> 01:28:36.813
- Excelsior. Look it up.
- Oh!

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.564
- What?
- Yeah.

01:28:38.731 --> 01:28:41.067
- Excelsior.
- - Oh, Pat.

01:28:41.234 --> 01:28:44.487
Not that I give a fuck about football
or your superstitions,

01:28:44.654 --> 01:28:46.489
but if it's me reading the signs,

01:28:46.656 --> 01:28:50.159
I don't send the Eagles guy
whose personal motto is "excelsior"

01:28:50.326 --> 01:28:52.328
to a fucking Giants game,

01:28:52.495 --> 01:28:55.331
especially when he's already
in a legal situation.

01:28:55.498 --> 01:28:58.960
- - Unbelievable.
- Wow. How did you know all that stuff?

01:28:59.377 --> 01:29:01.546
I did my research.

01:29:03.423 --> 01:29:06.718
- Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.
- - Thank you.

01:29:06.884 --> 01:29:09.971
Yeah. I gotta rethink
this whole thing.

01:29:11.139 --> 01:29:14.267
I didn't trust her before,
but I gotta say, now I do.

01:29:14.434 --> 01:29:15.935
Oh, now you like her, Dad?

01:29:16.769 --> 01:29:19.105
I have to say I do. Yup.

01:29:19.439 --> 01:29:22.608
Patrizio, I feel terrible,
you know?

01:29:22.775 --> 01:29:25.486
You made the bet,
I won a lot of money,

01:29:25.653 --> 01:29:27.822
and now your whole family
is in turmoil.

01:29:27.989 --> 01:29:30.450
Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it.

01:29:30.616 --> 01:29:33.786
You live for this.
You've bet against my father for years.

01:29:33.953 --> 01:29:36.622
You're twisting the knife now.
You get off on it!

01:29:36.789 --> 01:29:38.583
That's not true. Don't say that.

01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:41.127
- Fine, then prove it!
- Yeah, prove it.

01:29:41.294 --> 01:29:42.814
How do you want me
to prove it?

01:29:42.962 --> 01:29:44.464
How do you prove it?

01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:47.842
- How do I prove it?
- A chance to win back everything.

01:29:48.009 --> 01:29:49.844
- Double or nothing.
- No, no, no.

01:29:50.011 --> 01:29:53.973
Double or nothing on the Bengals
next week, is that what you're saying?

01:29:55.099 --> 01:29:56.768
Mm-mm.

01:29:59.437 --> 01:30:01.230
- Against the Cowboys.
- Oh!

01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:04.358
- Oh, come on, are you kidding?
- That's his team.

01:30:04.525 --> 01:30:06.527
That's your team,
isn't it, Randy?

01:30:06.694 --> 01:30:09.530
- I know who his team is.
- - When is the game?

01:30:09.697 --> 01:30:12.408
- December 28th, last of the season.
- - Oh, my God.

01:30:12.575 --> 01:30:16.788
Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs
Open Freestyle Dance Competition.

01:30:16.954 --> 01:30:18.372
- - Oh, God.
- Randy.

01:30:18.539 --> 01:30:20.708
Don't you believe
in America's team?

01:30:20.875 --> 01:30:23.377
Yeah, don't you believe
in America's team?

01:30:23.544 --> 01:30:28.007
I believe in America's team.
But if I win that bet, I win your book,

01:30:28.174 --> 01:30:31.427
you're out of action,
you get no restaurant, no nothing.

01:30:32.887 --> 01:30:35.431
- I like it.
- - No. No, Patrizio.

01:30:35.598 --> 01:30:39.435
I believe in the Eagles, my son.
I'll take the action. I'll take it.

01:30:39.602 --> 01:30:41.938
- - Dad.
- Patrizio, don't. It's toxic.

01:30:42.105 --> 01:30:44.774
I have faith.
Excelsior belongs in this house.

01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:47.527
- Dad.
- Not in New York. In this house.

01:30:47.693 --> 01:30:50.696
Dad, I didn't know excelsior
was the motto of New York.

01:30:50.863 --> 01:30:53.032
- But now I know.
- This is toxic.

01:30:53.199 --> 01:30:55.868
Dad, this is toxic.
You shouldn't be doing this.

01:30:56.035 --> 01:30:58.788
Quiet, you already did enough.
What do you say?

01:30:58.955 --> 01:31:00.915
My Birds, Benjamin Franklin's team,

01:31:01.082 --> 01:31:03.793
favoured one and a half points.
Give you 3 more.

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.838
Patrizio, stop it.
Randy, don't you take the bet!

01:31:07.004 --> 01:31:10.133
- In fact, I'll give you 10 points.
- No, Dad!

01:31:10.299 --> 01:31:13.261
- Dad! This is insanity!
- Dad!

01:31:13.427 --> 01:31:16.931
- Take that bet on the Cowboys.
- - Dolores, will you stop him?

01:31:17.181 --> 01:31:18.599
- Jesus!
- - Yeah.

01:31:18.766 --> 01:31:21.644
How could you not take that bet?
Even with 10 points.

01:31:21.811 --> 01:31:25.398
That's an insane spread to your
advantage. Cowboys are cowards.

01:31:25.565 --> 01:31:28.401
I bet you're such a coward,
you won't take the 10.

01:31:28.568 --> 01:31:32.113
Plus, whatever their score is
at the dance thing. What's that?

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:33.948
- What's that?
- No, no, no.

01:31:34.115 --> 01:31:37.785
You're crazy to give away
that many points. I won't take that.

01:31:37.952 --> 01:31:39.370
However, wait a second.

01:31:42.498 --> 01:31:47.587
- I do like the idea of a parlay.
- What? No parlay! No.

01:31:47.753 --> 01:31:50.965
- No, don't do it. Don't do it.
- - Mother of God.

01:31:51.132 --> 01:31:54.635
How do they run this dance
competition? How do they score it?

01:31:54.802 --> 01:31:58.472
I don't know how they score.
We're participating, not a part of it.

01:31:58.639 --> 01:32:01.392
There's people...
This is a high-end dance contest.

01:32:01.559 --> 01:32:03.769
Do not put it as part of the parlay.

01:32:03.936 --> 01:32:07.440
They go by Philadelphia rules.
Each dancer is scored 1 to 10,

01:32:07.607 --> 01:32:10.193
10 the highest,
average the four judges' scores.

01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:12.778
OK, scores from 1 to 10, right?

01:32:12.945 --> 01:32:14.488
And you guys are how good?

01:32:14.655 --> 01:32:16.282
- We suck.
- We don't suck.

01:32:16.449 --> 01:32:19.619
Pat's a beginner, I'm OK.
We're happy just to be going.

01:32:19.785 --> 01:32:21.871
The people you're competing against?

01:32:22.038 --> 01:32:24.081
They're good.
Some of them are professionals.

01:32:24.248 --> 01:32:25.875
Better than you?

01:32:26.334 --> 01:32:28.878
- A lot better.
- - A lot better.

01:32:29.045 --> 01:32:33.424
If I was to say you only have to score 5,
I'd be really very generous, right?

01:32:33.591 --> 01:32:35.635
No, no.
That'd be amazing if we got 5.

01:32:35.801 --> 01:32:38.721
- Let's not get...
- We can get a 5. Give me a break.

01:32:38.888 --> 01:32:40.806
- We can't get 5.
- Give me a break.

01:32:40.973 --> 01:32:43.684
- You'll get a 5. You'll get a 5.
- - We can do a 5.

01:32:43.851 --> 01:32:45.478
- What?
- - That's the parlay.

01:32:45.645 --> 01:32:50.524
- Will somebody explain me the parlay?
- Win two bets or lose the whole thing.

01:32:50.691 --> 01:32:53.444
For Pat Sr. to win,
Birds gotta beat the Cowboys,

01:32:53.611 --> 01:32:57.615
plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get
at least a 5 at the dance.

01:32:57.782 --> 01:33:00.701
- That's very, very manic indeed.
- That's the parlay.

01:33:00.868 --> 01:33:02.788
- We'll shake on it.
- Shake on it.

01:33:02.912 --> 01:33:04.552
- No! Oh, God.
- It's a bet.

01:33:04.664 --> 01:33:06.415
I'm not gonna be a part of this.

01:33:06.582 --> 01:33:09.502
Randy, you're a fucking sickness,
Randy. I'm out.

01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:12.505
- Pat, you can't quit.
- I'm not doing the dance.

01:33:12.672 --> 01:33:15.049
- Calm down. Think about...
- - See you later.

01:33:15.216 --> 01:33:18.469
- Pat, no. Pat.
- What are you doing?

01:33:18.636 --> 01:33:20.054
- I'm out.
- - What?

01:33:20.221 --> 01:33:22.306
Here we are again
at the one-yard line.

01:33:22.473 --> 01:33:25.726
DeSean, snatching defeat
from the jaws of victory.

01:33:25.893 --> 01:33:27.937
- There you go.
- What does that mean?

01:33:28.104 --> 01:33:31.649
That connection with DeSean Jackson,
it doesn't matter anymore.

01:33:31.816 --> 01:33:35.027
Just because I have the jersey on.
I'm not gonna do it.

01:33:35.194 --> 01:33:37.280
You are not a stand-up guy right now.

01:33:37.446 --> 01:33:42.118
- If it's me reading the signs...
- You reading the signs? Oh, OK.

01:33:44.078 --> 01:33:48.624
- - Pat! Pat!
- You are not a stand-up guy!

01:33:51.085 --> 01:33:52.503
Uh-oh.

01:33:55.089 --> 01:33:57.341
I told you not to push it.

01:33:57.758 --> 01:34:00.052
He's gotta do this.
He can't be a quitter.

01:34:00.219 --> 01:34:04.015
- He cannot be a quitter.
- You took that stupid parlay thing.

01:34:04.181 --> 01:34:08.269
Now he won't do the dance. It was
very constructive for him. You ruined it.

01:34:08.436 --> 01:34:10.479
Only one way to get him to show.

01:34:10.646 --> 01:34:12.440
- What's that?
- What's that?

01:34:12.606 --> 01:34:15.359
We have to tell him
Nikki's gonna be there.

01:34:30.458 --> 01:34:33.336
- - She won't come.
- We have to tell him she's coming.

01:34:33.502 --> 01:34:35.546
- We have to tell him.
- That's a lie.

01:34:35.713 --> 01:34:37.131
- White lie.
- White lie.

01:34:37.298 --> 01:34:39.884
That's no big deal. So it's a little lie.

01:34:40.509 --> 01:34:42.219
- No other way.
- - No.

01:34:42.386 --> 01:34:44.430
We gotta leave a trail
of breadcrumbs

01:34:44.597 --> 01:34:47.600
so that he can live his life
without ruining it.

01:34:47.767 --> 01:34:50.394
No. I don't approve.

01:34:50.561 --> 01:34:53.439
- You can't do it.
- Well, you know, I didn't approve

01:34:53.606 --> 01:34:57.360
when you told her where he was
running so she could ambush him.

01:34:57.526 --> 01:35:01.405
I didn't approve of that,
but you did it anyway, so I'm doing this.

01:35:01.572 --> 01:35:02.990
That's it.

01:35:03.157 --> 01:35:05.743
We're gonna tell him
Nikki will be there.

01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:13.542
- You gotta be part of it.
- We have to do it.

01:35:14.001 --> 01:35:16.921
Aren't you nervous
to be lying?

01:35:17.129 --> 01:35:18.589
No.

01:35:19.173 --> 01:35:20.883
A little bit.

01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:23.052
But it's for the best.

01:35:27.431 --> 01:35:29.683
"But if it was me
reading the signs..."

01:35:31.185 --> 01:35:32.603
I...

01:36:02.049 --> 01:36:03.676
That's it.

01:36:04.343 --> 01:36:06.053
OK.

01:36:30.536 --> 01:36:32.121
Hey.

01:36:36.417 --> 01:36:38.210
Hey, what's up?

01:36:41.922 --> 01:36:43.591
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's fine.

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:37:18.167 --> 01:37:20.836
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:34.808
This isn't working.

01:37:35.351 --> 01:37:37.478
Stupid!

01:38:09.343 --> 01:38:11.387
Come on, it's gonna be great.

01:38:11.554 --> 01:38:14.431
Nikki's gonna be there, you know?

01:38:14.598 --> 01:38:17.768
Everything's gonna come together.
It's what's meant to be.

01:38:18.352 --> 01:38:20.020
You OK?

01:38:21.063 --> 01:38:24.858
- Well, don't get wobbly on me.
- I'm not.

01:38:25.025 --> 01:38:27.778
We have a dance to do, a parlay.
Stay focused.

01:38:28.195 --> 01:38:31.073
- I'm focused.
- Good, let's go.

01:38:48.132 --> 01:38:50.801
- Look at the dancers. You see them?
- Shit.

01:38:55.806 --> 01:38:58.559
Hey, Randy, Jake. What do we got?

01:38:58.726 --> 01:39:01.061
Dallas just tied it
with a field goal, 3-3.

01:39:01.228 --> 01:39:04.523
- - I'm worried about the bet.
- Don't worry about the bet.

01:39:04.690 --> 01:39:06.650
Holy shit.

01:39:09.570 --> 01:39:11.322
<i>Is this Dancing with the Stars?</i>

01:39:11.488 --> 01:39:14.950
Well, you knew that.
Maybe you should've scouted them.

01:39:15.409 --> 01:39:17.369
Look at those
fucking dancers.

01:39:20.414 --> 01:39:23.417
You can give me the money now,
you know.

01:39:24.084 --> 01:39:26.670
Patty, all we have to do
is we have to make a 5.

01:39:26.837 --> 01:39:29.423
- Watch the game with me.
- The Birds are better

01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:32.468
- when Pat is with me, we settled that.
- Stay for...

01:39:32.635 --> 01:39:36.096
Relax, we're gonna be fine.
I'll see you up there, OK?

01:39:36.263 --> 01:39:38.182
Hey, Pat, Tiffany.

01:39:38.349 --> 01:39:40.392
- - Hey.
- Glorious, beautiful occasion.

01:39:40.559 --> 01:39:42.645
Yeah, yeah. All right, I'll see you.

01:39:42.811 --> 01:39:46.106
- All right, wish me luck.
- - Excelsior.

01:39:47.691 --> 01:39:50.110
- What's this?
- I thought you were doing it.

01:39:50.277 --> 01:39:54.365
I thought you were doing it. We're doing
a dance anyway, for God sakes.

01:39:58.243 --> 01:40:00.204
You OK?

01:40:01.955 --> 01:40:06.043
I want you to remember everything,
all of the good stuff that we have here.

01:40:06.210 --> 01:40:09.797
- - Of course I do.
- Just check in. I gotta go find Veronica.

01:40:10.172 --> 01:40:11.590
- Good evening.
- - Evening.

01:40:11.757 --> 01:40:14.259
- Check in.
- Please.

01:40:14.426 --> 01:40:16.428
How many dancers are there?

01:40:18.389 --> 01:40:21.183
What? Nikki?

01:40:23.435 --> 01:40:25.145
Nikki.

01:40:25.521 --> 01:40:27.773
Oh, Jesus.

01:40:41.203 --> 01:40:42.871
Let's get over here.
Come on.

01:40:43.038 --> 01:40:45.457
What the fuck?

01:40:46.208 --> 01:40:50.421
- Sweetie, sweetie. Honey, calm down.
- You're killing me.

01:40:50.587 --> 01:40:54.925
She'll see how well he's doing,
maybe she'll lift the restraining order.

01:40:55.092 --> 01:40:57.636
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- - Pat told me.

01:40:57.803 --> 01:41:01.640
He told me you should never
throw a marriage out the window.

01:41:01.807 --> 01:41:04.268
- He did not say that.
- - Yes.

01:41:04.435 --> 01:41:08.272
Said it several times. It's his chance.
You gotta give him a chance.

01:41:38.927 --> 01:41:40.804
Bartender.

01:41:41.597 --> 01:41:44.391
Bartender, can I get
a vodka, please?

01:42:07.706 --> 01:42:10.667
- So you want another one?
- Sure.

01:43:20.529 --> 01:43:22.281
So, what do you do?

01:43:22.447 --> 01:43:24.116
I'm a lawyer.

01:43:24.283 --> 01:43:27.286
- Litigator, actually.
- Oh.

01:43:27.995 --> 01:43:29.872
The scores for Santos-Aguilar...

01:43:30.038 --> 01:43:31.540
The arguing guy.

01:43:31.707 --> 01:43:38.714
Seven-point-six, 7.3,
7.4, and 6.9.

01:43:38.881 --> 01:43:42.342
For an average score of 7.3.

01:43:43.051 --> 01:43:46.054
- <i>- Three, two, one!</i>
- Holy shit!

01:43:46.221 --> 01:43:49.516
<i>Philadelphia beats Dallas!
They are on their way</i>

01:43:49.683 --> 01:43:52.269
<i>- to the playoffs.</i>
- - Randy, what is happening?

01:44:00.444 --> 01:44:02.654
Where's Tiffany?
- - I don't know, Mom.

01:44:02.821 --> 01:44:04.239
- Seen her?
- Find her.

01:44:04.406 --> 01:44:06.700
I know. Mom, I know.

01:44:30.974 --> 01:44:33.477
Sorry. Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

01:44:33.644 --> 01:44:35.646
- - She's fine, buddy.
- She's fine?

01:44:35.812 --> 01:44:37.564
Why don't you shut up, OK?

01:44:37.731 --> 01:44:40.233
- How many drinks have you had?
- Two vodkas.

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:44.404
I don't know what choices you've made,
but deal with it. We're in this.

01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:47.908
- We're in what?
- - Next, Pat Solatano

01:44:48.075 --> 01:44:49.618
and Tiffany Maxwell.

01:44:49.785 --> 01:44:52.412
I used to think you were
the best thing that happened,

01:44:52.579 --> 01:44:55.332
but now I think you might
maybe be the worst thing.

01:44:55.499 --> 01:44:58.085
- I'm sorry that I ever met you.
- - Good for you.

01:44:58.251 --> 01:44:59.670
Come on, let's dance.

01:45:00.712 --> 01:45:07.719
And the scores for Nakarov
and Tretiak are 6.7, 8.1,

01:45:08.095 --> 01:45:11.056
7.5, and 6.5.

01:45:11.223 --> 01:45:14.101
For an average score of 7.2.

01:45:20.107 --> 01:45:21.942
They were great

01:45:22.109 --> 01:45:24.653
and they only got a 7.2.
This is a tough room.

01:45:25.028 --> 01:45:26.571
Got it.

01:45:28.365 --> 01:45:30.492
Up next, ladies and gentlemen,

01:45:30.659 --> 01:45:35.998
please welcome Pat Solatano Jr.
and Tiffany Maxwell.

01:45:39.501 --> 01:45:41.461
Come on, Pat!

01:45:44.297 --> 01:45:45.966
Damn.

01:45:52.389 --> 01:45:55.517
- Let's go, Patty!
- Come on, Pat.

01:48:52.819 --> 01:48:54.738
Yeah, Pat! Yeah!

01:48:55.947 --> 01:48:57.866
We love you, Pat!

01:49:05.665 --> 01:49:08.752
All right, let's see the scores
for Solatano and Maxwell.

01:49:08.919 --> 01:49:10.462
We have a 4.9...

01:49:12.339 --> 01:49:15.467
...4.8, a 4.9.

01:49:16.927 --> 01:49:19.554
That's too bad, guys.
That's a lot of 4's.

01:49:19.721 --> 01:49:21.348
And a 5.4.

01:49:22.807 --> 01:49:27.062
For an average score of 5.0.

01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:28.647
- Sorry.
- Sorry about that, guys.

01:49:31.107 --> 01:49:32.901
What? Come on!

01:49:36.238 --> 01:49:37.656
Dad, did the Eagles win?

01:49:37.822 --> 01:49:41.576
The Eagles won, 44-6.
They won, 44-6.

01:49:42.535 --> 01:49:45.455
- Come on!
- - We'll take a ten-minute break.

01:49:45.622 --> 01:49:47.666
Why are they so excited about a 5?

01:49:48.416 --> 01:49:50.627
Great. Good job.

01:49:56.216 --> 01:49:57.926
Thank you.
You were amazing.

01:50:21.741 --> 01:50:23.660
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

01:50:23.827 --> 01:50:26.663
- - How are you? You OK?
- I'm good. How are you?

01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:29.749
- I'm good. Thanks.
- You looked happy out there.

01:50:29.916 --> 01:50:32.377
- Did I? Who'd have thought, dancing?
- Yeah.

01:50:37.132 --> 01:50:39.467
- You look incredible.
- Thank you, yeah.

01:50:39.718 --> 01:50:41.136
You lost a lot of weight.

01:50:41.553 --> 01:50:44.472
Been reading your books,
I have a positive attitude.

01:50:44.639 --> 01:50:47.475
I'm on medication and I'm in therapy.

01:51:48.286 --> 01:51:50.163
- Where's Tiffany?
- She left.

01:51:50.330 --> 01:51:51.998
- What do you mean?
- She left.

01:51:52.165 --> 01:51:54.042
- What do you expect?
- Where is she?

01:51:54.209 --> 01:51:57.170
I know you don't wanna listen
to your father.

01:51:57.337 --> 01:52:00.090
You gotta pay attention to the signs.

01:52:00.256 --> 01:52:04.010
Life reaches out a moment like this,
it's a sin if you don't reach back.

01:52:04.177 --> 01:52:08.556
I'm telling you, it's a sin. It'll haunt you
the rest of your days like a curse.

01:52:08.723 --> 01:52:12.268
You're facing a big challenge
in your life now, this very moment.

01:52:12.435 --> 01:52:15.271
That girl loves you.
I don't know if Nikki ever did,

01:52:15.438 --> 01:52:19.734
but she sure doesn't love you right now.
I'm telling you, don't fuck this up.

01:52:21.611 --> 01:52:23.446
I love you, Dad.

01:52:37.961 --> 01:52:39.754
Hey!

01:52:55.895 --> 01:52:58.565
- Would you just leave me alone?
- Wait a second!

01:52:58.731 --> 01:53:02.277
- I have one more letter for you.
- Give it to her yourself!

01:53:02.444 --> 01:53:06.114
You don't ever have to see me again
if you just read it, all right?

01:53:06.656 --> 01:53:08.116
This is so fucked up.

01:53:08.283 --> 01:53:09.826
Yeah, just read it.

01:53:11.327 --> 01:53:13.246
"Dear Tiffany...

01:53:17.125 --> 01:53:19.294
I know you wrote the letter."

01:53:27.051 --> 01:53:31.473
- Only way you could meet my crazy.
- Was doing something crazy yourself.

01:53:31.639 --> 01:53:33.057
Thank you.

01:53:33.224 --> 01:53:35.143
I love you.

01:53:38.146 --> 01:53:40.899
I knew it the minute I met you.

01:53:41.649 --> 01:53:44.777
I'm sorry it took so long for me
to catch up.

01:53:44.944 --> 01:53:47.280
I just got stuck.

01:53:47.447 --> 01:53:49.115
Pat.

01:53:51.951 --> 01:53:54.412
I wrote that a week ago.

01:53:54.871 --> 01:53:57.832
- You wrote that a week ago?
- Yes, I did.

01:53:57.999 --> 01:54:00.543
You let me lie to you for a week?

01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:03.338
I was trying to be romantic.

01:54:04.923 --> 01:54:06.341
You love me?

01:54:06.508 --> 01:54:08.301
Yeah, I do.

01:54:14.265 --> 01:54:15.850
OK.

01:54:50.593 --> 01:54:54.847
<i>The world will break your heart
ten ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed.</i>

01:54:55.014 --> 01:54:57.016
<i>And I can't begin to explain that.</i>

01:54:57.308 --> 01:55:00.895
<i>Or the craziness inside myself
and everybody else, but guess what.</i>

01:55:01.563 --> 01:55:04.566
<i>Sunday is my favourite day again.</i>

01:55:04.732 --> 01:55:10.113
<i>I think of everything everyone did
for me and I feel like a very lucky guy.</i>

01:55:12.615 --> 01:55:15.577
We have to beat
the Vikings by 3. I'm giving you a 6,

01:55:15.743 --> 01:55:18.871
which is very generous
after the beating you just took.

01:55:19.038 --> 01:55:20.873
What are we talking about here?

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:23.876
Do another parlay
if you make it to the next round.

01:55:24.043 --> 01:55:26.296
We are gonna make it
to the next round.

01:55:26.462 --> 01:55:28.381
- <i>Did you? I laid that down.</i>
- No.

01:55:28.548 --> 01:55:30.800
- No, that was me.
- No, that was me.

01:55:30.967 --> 01:55:32.385
No, I played the jack.

01:55:32.552 --> 01:55:34.971
Put the breadcrumbs, the garlic
in the steak,

01:55:35.138 --> 01:55:39.392
- and you roll it up with the toothpicks?
- Yeah. For maybe three hours, plus.

01:55:39.559 --> 01:55:41.811
Everything's good,
everything's good.

01:55:41.978 --> 01:55:43.646
I got you, you're all down.

01:55:43.813 --> 01:55:47.900
Randy, he's complaining. He lost a lot
of money. He's moaning and groaning.

01:55:48.067 --> 01:55:52.113
The restaurant's happening because
of Randy so everything's good.
