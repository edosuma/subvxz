WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:04.205
* Whoo *

00:04.272 --> 00:08.509
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

00:09.910 --> 00:13.314
Sorry about the diaper,

00:13.381 --> 00:14.848
but your grandfather bought
adult small

00:14.915 --> 00:16.250
instead of kids small.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.252
I'd go out and get your size,

00:18.319 --> 00:20.521
but me and Maw Maw's birthday
party is starting.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.157
It used to bother me

00:23.224 --> 00:24.858
that I had to share my birthday
with Maw Maw,

00:24.925 --> 00:26.594
because she had way more
friends than I did.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.630
And they wouldn't give me any
cake unless I sang for them

00:29.697 --> 00:34.034
in a funny voice.
*...like a candle that shines *

00:34.102 --> 00:36.003
* All the way
around the world. *

00:36.070 --> 00:37.571
(applause)

00:37.638 --> 00:41.475
But tonight's birthday party
is going to be great,

00:41.542 --> 00:43.844
'cause I have way more friends
than Maw Maw these days

00:43.911 --> 00:45.246
thanks to strokes, pneumonia

00:45.313 --> 00:47.848
and a bus crash on the way
to Atlantic City.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.383
But I'm willing to share

00:49.450 --> 00:52.853
so we can still have
a combo surprise party.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.288
ALL:
Surprise!

00:54.355 --> 00:56.790
My goodness. For me?

00:56.857 --> 00:58.326
I'm going to get my camera. Oh!

00:58.392 --> 00:59.627
Seeing how happy it makes her,

00:59.693 --> 01:01.529
and knowing
how forgetful she is,

01:01.595 --> 01:03.297
we can't help ourselves
from doing it

01:03.364 --> 01:04.932
every time she comes
back in the room.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.767
Why am I holding this camera?

01:06.834 --> 01:08.302
ALL:
Surprise!

01:08.369 --> 01:11.405
Oh, my goodness. For me?

01:11.472 --> 01:14.208
Every year the number
of candles grows,

01:14.275 --> 01:16.444
but the size
of the cake stays the same.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.846
It's a tradition
we've done every year.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.814
Well, almost every year.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.883
Although it was only
five years ago,

01:22.950 --> 01:25.386
things were a lot different
than they are today.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.787
For one, the Hungry Hungry
Hippos game

01:26.854 --> 01:28.156
had all its marbles.

01:30.023 --> 01:34.027
New York Times crossword,
you are my bitch.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.397
And five years ago,
your great-great Maw Maw

01:36.464 --> 01:38.199
hadn't lost her marbles
yet either.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.700
You're in a good mood.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.203
Well, of course I am.
I'm turning 80 tomorrow.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.172
And I can still do this.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.142
Now let's get those
breakfast orders in.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.843
BOTH: Two eggs over easy,
slightly runny

01:49.910 --> 01:51.712
with bacon and buttered toast.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.214
BOTH:
I love you.

01:54.715 --> 01:58.186
(muffled hard rock
music playing)

02:00.254 --> 02:02.022
He's awake.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.325
Well, somebody find out
what he wants for breakfast.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.861
And five years ago--
(knocking)

02:07.928 --> 02:10.798
well, let's just say I was
going through a phase.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.033
(hard rock music plays)
Hey, buddy.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.868
Get out!

02:14.935 --> 02:16.470
(whimpering)

02:20.208 --> 02:23.010
Big birthday tomorrow, huh?

02:23.076 --> 02:25.279
18 years old. You excited?

02:25.346 --> 02:27.781
I have a surprise
for you.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.483
Oh, what'd you get
for him, Maw Maw?

02:29.550 --> 02:31.185
Did you get something cool
we all can use,

02:31.252 --> 02:32.520
like a trampoline
or a mini trampoline

02:32.586 --> 02:33.987
or something else we
could all bounce on?

02:34.054 --> 02:35.556
It's a surprise.

02:35.623 --> 02:38.158
Did you hear that? Maw Maw's got
a surprise for you, Jimmy.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.294
You know that's
not my name!

02:40.361 --> 02:42.230
If you want
to address me,

02:42.296 --> 02:45.699
you must call me
"Drakkar Noir."

02:45.766 --> 02:47.868
Like the men's perfume, right?

02:47.935 --> 02:50.271
It means "Black Dragon Ship."

02:58.346 --> 03:00.281
Your makeup
looks nice today.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.649
(slams table)

03:03.584 --> 03:05.886
(country music playing
over speakers)

03:07.721 --> 03:10.724
That was the third time
you called me stupid today.

03:10.791 --> 03:13.394
'Cause that's the third
stupid thing you've said today.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.895
If someday we did
have a daughter,

03:14.962 --> 03:17.665
naming her
Princess BeyoncÃ©
would be stupid.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.571
Well, thanks for taking the time
to look at my application.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.873
My cousin says you
are a very busy man.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.541
Yeah, I am a busy man.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.611
But never too busy to meet
a new friend-slash-employee.

03:30.678 --> 03:34.147
And if you're anything
like your cousin Shelley,
we'd be lucky to have you.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.451
Her and Frank are the best
shelf stockers we've ever had.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.560
Wow.
Barney, you totally gotta
hire that chick.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.863
Girls with braces have
absolutely no self-esteem.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.433
My mother has braces, Frank.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.934
Have her stop by.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.103
Basically I'm just looking
for something part-time

03:56.169 --> 03:57.805
while I go to college.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.573
College? Oh, I see.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.442
Just passing through our
little grocery store, are you?

04:01.509 --> 04:04.978
Just a quick stop on
the glamorous road to
fame and fortune.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.947
We had a skinny little
fella come in here

04:07.014 --> 04:08.749
thinking like that
about 15 years ago.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.618
Thought he was gonna
take over the world.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.252
You know where that
guy is today?

04:13.721 --> 04:14.622
Was it you?

04:14.688 --> 04:15.656
Yep.

04:15.723 --> 04:16.790
That sucks.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.826
Yep.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.994
(crickets chirping)

04:22.563 --> 04:23.964
(air horn blaring)

04:24.031 --> 04:26.667
(gasping)

04:26.734 --> 04:28.736
(air horn continues blaring)

04:30.638 --> 04:32.072
It's after midnight.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.140
It's your birthday.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.508
It's time for
your surprise.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.576
It's in the front yard.

04:35.643 --> 04:38.145
Oh, man, trampoline!

04:38.211 --> 04:40.614
Trampoline! Trampoline!
Trampoline! Trampoline!

04:40.681 --> 04:43.384
Trampoline. Trampoline.
Trampoline. Trampoline.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.521
JIMMY:
What's all that?

04:47.588 --> 04:48.622
I think it's our stuff.

04:52.326 --> 04:55.028
Sayonara, suckers!

05:14.214 --> 05:16.650
I think Jogging Dan
just stole your roller skates.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.019
Damn. I was going to
take the wheels off

05:19.086 --> 05:20.521
and use those for dress shoes.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.495
(sizzling)
What do you think?
What are the chances

05:27.561 --> 05:29.530
Maw Maw cools off
and lets us back in?

05:29.597 --> 05:30.998
I doubt it. When I chased her
down the block

05:31.064 --> 05:33.033
this morning, she
said we never clean,

05:33.100 --> 05:34.568
cook or pay for anything.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.670
Now that we're all adults,
she can throw us out

05:36.737 --> 05:38.472
without feeling guilty.
So other than
that hot dog,

05:38.539 --> 05:40.908
what else did you find
in the glove compartment?

05:40.974 --> 05:43.744
A couple of hair scrunchies
and 36 cents in pennies.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.079
But they're all stuck
together with dried soda.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.548
That's okay.
I'll suck 'em loose.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.352
Did you guys just eat
all the food?

05:52.420 --> 05:54.054
Sorry, Drakkar Noir.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.556
I'm gonna starve.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.957
BURT:
No one is going to starve.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.726
Your mother and I know
how to take care of you.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.994
In fact, we're just getting
ready to take you out for lunch.

06:03.631 --> 06:08.001
All right, let's stretch
a buck in this joint.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.734
* *

06:45.205 --> 06:48.476
Can I sample some
of that American cheese?

06:48.542 --> 06:50.744
I've always been curious.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.034
* *

07:22.175 --> 07:23.276
Wow.

07:23.343 --> 07:27.548
Sabrina,
whose carts are these?

07:27.615 --> 07:29.517
I don't know.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.890
Gypsies.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.527
Hi.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.030
How was work?

07:43.096 --> 07:44.865
Good. My boss said
she'll rent us a room,

07:44.932 --> 07:46.867
but we got to leave right now.
Where are your clothes?

07:46.934 --> 07:49.202
Well, stupid Burt talked me into

07:49.269 --> 07:51.071
sneaking into
the stupid house,

07:51.138 --> 07:54.642
and stupid Barbara June turned
the stupid hose on us.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.009
Anyway, our clothes
got kind of wet,

07:56.076 --> 07:57.911
so I put them
on the roof to dry.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.747
You guys know we're parked
under a tree, right?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.752
(birds squawking)

08:04.818 --> 08:09.189
(loud rattling)
Okay, it comes
with a washer-dryer,

08:09.256 --> 08:11.058
but you can't use it,

08:11.124 --> 08:15.495
because my mother has
a 24-hour laundry business.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.364
It's kind of noisy at night,

08:17.430 --> 08:18.766
but if you close your eyes,

08:18.832 --> 08:20.167
(buzzer sounds)
it sounds like jazz.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.902
Hmm. What's that thing?

08:21.969 --> 08:24.938
That's my husband's alpaca.
His name is Clyde.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.075
He won't spit at you
unless you look him in the eye.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.109
Sounds reasonable.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.243
I appreciate this, Rosa.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.981
You're really helping us
out of a bind here.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.683
Ay, Dios mio.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.685
It's El Diablo.
El Diablo.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.119
(speaking Spanish frantically)

08:39.186 --> 08:41.855
Vete, El Diablo.
Vete al infierno.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.957
What's going on there?

08:44.024 --> 08:47.160
It seems my mother thinks
that your son is the devil.

08:47.227 --> 08:51.599
(laughs) I kinda doubt the devil
would still be a virgin at 18.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.167
Virginia!
(scoffs)

08:54.234 --> 08:55.903
Sorry, Drakkar.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.975
I don't see what
the big deal is.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.578
Just wash your face,
and they'll let us live there.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.846
Watch it, Burt.
Remember that Dateline

09:05.913 --> 09:07.247
about the kid
who looked like him?

09:07.314 --> 09:09.116
I don't care.
We need a place to stay.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.084
I'm sick of being scared
of my own son

09:11.151 --> 09:13.020
just 'cause he walks around
looking like Count Dorkula.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.689
At least I'm not like
30-something years old

09:15.756 --> 09:17.891
and living in a van.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.293
You guys can't even
take care of your child.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.830
I just found you
a great basement to live in.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.765
You are one wet washcloth away

09:24.832 --> 09:26.767
from having a roof over a floor
over your head.

09:26.834 --> 09:27.901
And as of today,

09:27.968 --> 09:29.136
you're not a child
anymore anyway.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.138
So if you think you can
do a better job

09:31.204 --> 09:33.040
of taking care of
yourself, go for it.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.008
Maybe I will.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.844
Well, good.
And when you're ready

09:36.910 --> 09:38.345
to take off that stupid makeup

09:38.411 --> 09:39.780
and be not freaky,

09:39.847 --> 09:41.581
you can come live
with your normal family,

09:41.649 --> 09:43.150
in a Mexican lady's
laundry room

09:43.216 --> 09:45.318
with the crazy-ass
looking sheep.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.654
(Dan grunts)

09:52.525 --> 09:55.763
So there's no way I can stay
with either of you guys?

09:55.829 --> 09:57.230
Sorry, man.
My family has hated you

09:57.297 --> 09:59.733
ever since you talked me
into dressing up like this.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.368
Mine, too.
I mean, I dig it,

10:01.434 --> 10:03.704
but it turns out my parents
aren't real cool with me

10:03.771 --> 10:04.938
walking around
in whiteface.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.277
He is so beautiful.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.814
I wish he'd just fly into my
house in the middle of the night

10:13.881 --> 10:16.483
and kill my whole family
and carry me away.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.119
Somebody's got to stop
reading those Twilight books.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.789
Says the girl who spoke
Klingon for an entire summer.

10:21.855 --> 10:25.192
(speaking Klingon-sounding
language)

10:25.258 --> 10:28.028
I just said I was considering
being a vegetarian.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.931
Oh, boo-hoo, it's a cow.
It's delicious.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.633
It was born to be on a plate
next to a baked potato.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.669
God, you're
such a softie.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.637
(falsetto):
"I can't kill anything."

10:37.705 --> 10:40.540
You know, it's none
of my business,

10:40.607 --> 10:43.977
but you might want to think
about getting rid of that guy.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.716
I just may do that.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.383
Excuse me, son.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.619
We're going to be closing in
five minutes, so you have to...

10:52.686 --> 10:54.688
Ow! Ow.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.523
Something's wrong
with my arm.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.691
I keep getting
these shooting pains.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.860
Anyway, you gotta go.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.808
Oh. Hi, Mike!

11:14.875 --> 11:16.676
How was the porn
this weekend?

11:16.744 --> 11:18.145
Amazing.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.213
Except for the carpal tunnel
and slight dehydration.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.197
(Beck's "Devil's Haircut"
begins)

11:42.169 --> 11:45.739
* Something's wrong
'cause my mind is fading *

11:45.806 --> 11:50.077
Whoo! Brr!
* And everywhere I look
there's a dead end waiting *

11:50.143 --> 11:53.380
* Temperature's dropping
at the rotten oasis *

11:53.446 --> 11:57.350
* Stealing kisses
from the leprous faces *

11:58.786 --> 12:01.254
* Got a devil's haircut *

12:01.321 --> 12:02.522
* In my mind *

12:02.589 --> 12:04.557
* Got a devil's haircut *

12:04.624 --> 12:06.159
* In my mind *

12:06.226 --> 12:08.829
* Got a devil's haircut *

12:08.896 --> 12:10.163
* In my mind *

12:10.230 --> 12:12.665
* Got a devil's haircut *

12:12.732 --> 12:15.803
MAN (on TV):
I mean, right, right here...
(indistinct)

12:17.704 --> 12:19.739
Yep, yep, yep, yep,
(laughing)

12:19.807 --> 12:22.375
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep...

12:22.442 --> 12:23.811
* In my mind! *

12:23.877 --> 12:27.380
* Devil's haircut in my mind! *

12:27.447 --> 12:29.216
Okay, folks, big news.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.119
We've got a new flavor
of tortilla chip today.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.687
Creamy balsamic ranch
blue cheese vinaigrette.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.859
They taste just like salad,
without all that nasty lettuce.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.508
(sotto voce):
Take me away, Dark Prince.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.410
(rattling)

13:00.780 --> 13:01.781
(washing machine timer buzzes)

13:01.849 --> 13:04.651
Oh.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.486
Hello.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.156
You've been asleep
for 29 loads of laundry.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.024
Okay.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.659
Where's your mother?

13:12.725 --> 13:16.296
Working. She's been gone for
about six loads of laundry.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.832
She'll be back in about three
or four loads of laundry.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.633
What's that kid
talking about?

13:20.700 --> 13:24.137
I think they measure time
in loads of laundry.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.641
Oh! Ah, damn.
What...?

13:28.708 --> 13:30.743
Not cool, man, not cool.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.845
You looked him in the eye.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.247
Yeah, but just for like
a second. Damn, Clyde.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.183
Ugh!

13:46.793 --> 13:48.028
Phew.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.429
You guys got any food?

13:51.965 --> 13:53.800
Please, Maw Maw?

13:53.867 --> 13:56.436
We're sleeping on a cold floor.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.539
We begged a seven-year-old
to make us French toast sticks.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.807
Just let us move back in.

14:00.874 --> 14:01.942
No!

14:02.009 --> 14:04.677
(whispering):
Ask her for some money.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.180
Can we at least have some cash?

14:07.247 --> 14:09.449
Why don't you just use
the money you stole from me?

14:09.516 --> 14:10.317
What?
I checked

14:10.383 --> 14:12.252
my purse after I
threw you guys out.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.854
There was a $20 bill
taken out of it.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.589
It had "Happy Birthday"
written on it.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.625
Wasn't me.
Do you think
Jimmy took it?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.928
If he did, he's probably already
spent it on a new corset.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.362
It's a lower back support.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.764
How long are we going to kid
ourselves? It's a corset!

14:24.831 --> 14:26.499
Please, Maw Maw.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.969
We don't know
who took your money.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.971
Just let us move back in.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.040
We'll change, we promise.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.775
You will never change!

14:35.842 --> 14:37.177
You're a couple of losers!

14:37.244 --> 14:38.611
And you'll always be

14:38.678 --> 14:40.080
a couple of losers!

14:41.314 --> 14:42.515
(Burt shrieks)

14:42.582 --> 14:44.251
Whoa!

14:44.317 --> 14:48.121
JIMMY:
Maybe it was being called
losers by Maw Maw.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.361
Maybe it was having to
use a washing machine

14:54.427 --> 14:55.762
for a sink.

14:55.828 --> 14:59.099
But whatever it was, my parents
finally realized it was time

14:59.166 --> 15:00.233
to grow up.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.302
All right!
We have a plan.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.105
BURT:
Step one,
get furniture from Dumpsters.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.839
Start with the one
behind the hospital.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.675
That always has good stuff.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.311
Step two, come up
with an advertising idea

15:11.378 --> 15:13.513
so I can get a few
more lawns to mow.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.548
Step three, start sucking up
to Rosa and her kids,

15:15.615 --> 15:17.550
so Rosa gives you
more shifts at work.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.653
Step four, stay in at night
and entertain ourselves,

15:20.720 --> 15:22.089
instead of going out
and spending money.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.556
If we do all that,

15:23.623 --> 15:25.358
and stick to our budget
each week, we should have

15:25.425 --> 15:28.595
$20 left over for us
to start paying back Maw Maw

15:28.661 --> 15:30.530
for all those years
she let us live there for free.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.499
Okay, um...

15:32.565 --> 15:35.268
You do have enough money
to pay for all this, right?

15:35.335 --> 15:37.270
Yeah. My brother-in-law
gave me five bucks
this morning.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.805
How much for the Zagnut?

15:38.871 --> 15:43.276
Okay, folks, today we've got
a sale on h-hair condention...

15:43.343 --> 15:44.844
(fumbles):
And softener... fab.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.714
Damn, these
mini-strokes.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.970
Gypsy.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.074
We've got a gypsy!

16:15.075 --> 16:16.743
We've got a gypsy!

16:21.281 --> 16:23.450
Maw Maw, you here?

16:23.516 --> 16:25.685
Can't wait to see her face
when she sees this money.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.220
Maw Maw,

16:27.287 --> 16:29.656
we got a little
surprise for ya.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.459
Well, look who finally decided
to show up for dinner.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.162
I've been sitting
here for five hours.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.064
Your grandfather hasn't
even bothered to call.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.398
Grandpa Wilfred?

16:38.465 --> 16:40.400
Bad enough he works
late all year.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.436
You think he'd be on time here
for my birthday.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.639
Maw Maw, Grandpa Wilfred
isn't at work; he's dead.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.281
Well, of course he is.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.349
I didn't mean... I just...

16:56.416 --> 16:58.385
I...
Are you okay?

16:58.451 --> 17:01.754
I'm fine. And I thought I told
you two not to come back here.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.223
You're on your own now.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.592
And I still want
my birthday money back.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.794
It was a gift
from my brother Sal.

17:07.860 --> 17:11.364
It would break his heart
if he knew you stole it.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.767
I didn't know she had
a brother named Sal.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.569
She doesn't.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.339
Burt, look at this.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.341
Her crossword puzzle's
all crazy.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.676
She played tic-tac-toe
in all the squares.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.445
She's been doing
that for a while.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.280
Why didn't you say anything?

17:27.347 --> 17:28.615
I'm not a puzzle guy.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.718
But... the $20 bill,
making dinner for dead people,

17:31.784 --> 17:33.320
the crazy crossword...

17:34.321 --> 17:36.223
Connect the dots.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.824
I just said I'm
not a puzzle guy.

17:37.890 --> 17:42.329
I think she might be getting
old-timer's disease.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.698
BURT:
So what are we
supposed to do?

17:45.765 --> 17:47.534
(sighs)

17:47.600 --> 17:50.237
No. No! Come on.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.339
We did it! We can
live on our own now.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.275
But she can't.

17:58.511 --> 18:01.448
We came here to pay her back.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.150
I think we should pay her back.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.717
Give me that pen.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.157
This belongs to you.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.424
I shouldn't
have taken it.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.560
Damn right
you shouldn't have taken it.

18:14.694 --> 18:15.595
Listen.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.531
We can't live
without you.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.368
We tried, but we
just can't do it.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.838
Will you please take us back?

18:25.905 --> 18:27.374
(sighs)

18:27.440 --> 18:29.542
Fine, you can move back in.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.711
But I have two rules.
Number one,

18:31.778 --> 18:34.314
you start chipping in and
doing your share around here.

18:34.381 --> 18:37.250
Number two, never let
my granddaughter Virginia

18:37.317 --> 18:39.186
and her no-good husband
back into this house.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.820
BOTH:
Deal.

18:49.562 --> 18:52.064
Excuse me, do you sell anything
that would get bloodstains

18:52.131 --> 18:53.600
out of the trunk of a car?

18:53.666 --> 18:54.701
Aisle six.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.836
Thank you!

18:56.903 --> 18:58.238
I've got the stuff.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.473
It's go time.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.744
You ready,
Stocky Balboa?

19:05.912 --> 19:08.748
You know it,
Dwayne the Stock Johnson.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.217
(over P.A.):
Attention, shoppers.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.652
Howdy's will be closing
in five minutes.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.362
Aha, gypsy!
(screams)

19:22.429 --> 19:25.665
("Home" by Edward Sharpe
and the Magnetic Zeros plays)

19:25.732 --> 19:26.933
(gagging)

19:26.999 --> 19:29.636
Help! Call the police!

19:32.339 --> 19:34.374

No...

19:42.449 --> 19:45.585
* Not the way
that I do love you *

19:45.652 --> 19:47.387
* Well, holy moly me-oh-my *

19:47.454 --> 19:49.956
* You're the apple of my eye *

19:50.022 --> 19:54.394
* Girl, I never
loved one like you *

19:54.461 --> 19:56.663
* Man, oh, man,
you're my best friend *

19:56.729 --> 19:58.631
* I'll scream it
to the nothingness *

19:58.698 --> 20:02.802
* There ain't nothing
that I need *

20:02.869 --> 20:04.804
* I'll follow you
into the park *

20:04.871 --> 20:06.973
* Through the jungle,
through the dark *

20:07.039 --> 20:11.077

loved one like you *

I'm with you *

I'm with you *

(Jimmy sobbing)

20:38.438 --> 20:39.672
What the hell are you doing?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.808
I was living in
the grocery store,

20:41.874 --> 20:43.276
but I got caught,

20:43.343 --> 20:44.811
and now I think
I'm going to jail!

20:44.877 --> 20:47.113
Whoa, you do not want
to be the guy in jail

20:47.179 --> 20:48.315
who wears the most
makeup. Get in!

20:48.381 --> 20:49.782

20:49.849 --> 20:52.352
(siren wails)

20:52.419 --> 20:53.686
He went that way!

20:57.123 --> 20:58.358
Thanks, Dad.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.559
You're welcome,
Drakkar Noir.

20:59.626 --> 21:03.496
Oh... I think I just
want to be Jimmy again.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.532
I'm sorry about what
I said about you and Mom.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.167
Hey, forget it. We all had
a little growing up to do.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.837
Let's get you inside and wash
your face before they come back.

21:10.903 --> 21:11.771
All right.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.374
Wait, we're living
here again?

21:14.441 --> 21:15.775
Long story.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.780
JIMMY:
So we all moved back in
with Maw Maw,

21:20.847 --> 21:23.816
only this time she needed us
as much as we needed her.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.585
Happy 80th,
Maw Maw.

21:25.652 --> 21:28.655
Thanks for letting us
spend it with you.

21:28.721 --> 21:29.989
Mmm.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.891
Hey, look who it is.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.729
And here we all are,

21:36.796 --> 21:39.699
five years later, still
celebrating birthdays.

21:39.766 --> 21:43.169
* Oh, home, let me come home *

21:43.235 --> 21:45.405
* Home is wherever
I'm with you... *

21:45.472 --> 21:46.906
Could you stop it?

21:46.973 --> 21:48.975
Hey, remember when you used
to wear all that makeup?

21:49.041 --> 21:50.242
You looked like a freak.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.678
Shut up.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.980
Never, ever say anything
about that around Sabrina.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.682
It's embarrassing.

21:55.748 --> 21:58.651
Don't worry, I wouldn't want
to mess up your chances.
