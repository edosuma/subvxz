01:30.710 --> 01:31.541
Hey, man.

01:31.670 --> 01:33.502
Can I get four...

01:34.800 --> 01:38.213
twenty-three on pump six, please?

01:48.520 --> 01:50.147
I'd like to add that to my purchase.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.550
Found something.

02:31.940 --> 02:33.760
-Salvation?
-Better.

02:34.150 --> 02:36.027
And I'd like to trade it...

02:37.490 --> 02:38.776
for the watch.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.020
-You found this at the beach?
-Yep.

02:44.580 --> 02:45.866
That's a Lynx ring.

02:46.370 --> 02:47.860
You have to be a Lynx to get one.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.282
How about that? What's a Lynx?

02:51.420 --> 02:54.162
They're a fraternal order,
like the Masons or the Elks.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.200
The Masons and the Elks. All right.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.542
All right, so what's it worth?

02:58.670 --> 02:59.751
Nothing.

03:00.090 --> 03:01.296
It's not real gold.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.710
What?

03:04.350 --> 03:06.887
-Really?
-Someday you'll know the difference.

03:07.770 --> 03:11.263
Well, there's a...
there's an inscription on it here.

03:12.730 --> 03:14.471
Do you speak Latin, Burt?

03:16.110 --> 03:17.316
I'm fluent.

03:17.820 --> 03:21.108
"Superius stout inferius."

03:22.200 --> 03:23.486
I've never heard of the Lynx.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.861
They have a lodge over by the...

03:26.790 --> 03:27.780
Orbis plant.

03:27.910 --> 03:29.901
The Orbis plant?
I drive by there every day.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.030
I've never seen it.

03:32.250 --> 03:33.320
I'm taking a break.

03:33.460 --> 03:34.780
All right, Hermie!

03:35.210 --> 03:36.792
Hermie-Dermie!

03:38.090 --> 03:39.080
Herm.

03:40.170 --> 03:41.752
Can you give me anything for it, man?

03:43.180 --> 03:46.559
If you need cash, I can open up
another line of credit for you.

03:48.350 --> 03:49.636
Never again.

03:50.020 --> 03:52.899
Eighty-nine-point-nine percent.
How do you sleep at night?

03:53.020 --> 03:55.557
The Dollar Center's at 126.6%.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.107
You're a parasite, Burt.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.640
My dad always said
that you were the saddest,

04:01.780 --> 04:04.158
most pathetic piece of shit
that he ever met.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.112
And you know what? He was right.

04:15.330 --> 04:16.331
All right,

04:16.459 --> 04:17.995
what will you give me for this?

05:05.260 --> 05:06.716
-Hello.
-Hey.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.751
Your sister called here,
looking for you.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.806
What did she want?

05:10.930 --> 05:12.807
To know when you're getting
a cell phone.

05:12.930 --> 05:14.841
Well, I don't live
in phone land any more.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.436
Where are you living right now?

05:16.560 --> 05:18.972
In the past, Alice. In the past.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.022
Give me three sprinkles,

05:21.150 --> 05:24.108
three twisties... and a bear claw.

05:25.490 --> 05:26.560
Look at you.

05:26.700 --> 05:29.237
Yeah, well, I just saw
my financial advisor, so...

05:31.330 --> 05:32.320
Oh, yeah.

05:32.750 --> 05:36.163
Knight's king to bishop's pawn,

05:36.290 --> 05:37.917
and then a double-queen zigzag.

05:38.040 --> 05:38.871
Do it.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.497
-So, are you going out later?
-I'm working all day.

05:42.630 --> 05:45.372
-Too bad. The swell's picking up.
-How would you know?

05:45.510 --> 05:48.047
Well,
because my eyes still work, Alice.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.137
Then stop being a pussy
and come out with me.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.052
-You've got to get back in the water.
-You know what?

05:53.180 --> 05:55.091
I've got better things to do, OK?

06:14.240 --> 06:15.446
Hey, bud.

06:15.950 --> 06:17.327
This isn't junk.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.417
It's a classic.

06:21.880 --> 06:22.870
I see you!

06:23.710 --> 06:24.700
Yeah, you!

06:27.510 --> 06:28.500
You better move!

06:30.720 --> 06:31.710
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah!

06:31.850 --> 06:32.885
Why don't you come back?

06:33.640 --> 06:34.630
Come back!

06:35.930 --> 06:39.343
Here you go -
all the glories of creation.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.819
-You take Bitcoin?
-No cryptocurrencies. Cash only.

06:42.940 --> 06:43.930
That's $50.

06:46.070 --> 06:46.889
Great.

06:47.030 --> 06:49.067
My name is Dr. Blaise St. John,

06:49.200 --> 06:53.364
and I would like to thank you for
making me your apothecary of choice.

06:56.120 --> 06:56.939
OK.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.993
You must love it when the rich kids
come down from Palos Verdes.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.578
They're second only
to the angels themselves.

07:02.710 --> 07:04.997
I have your earth, wind,
and fire kit ready to go.

07:06.170 --> 07:09.083
Everything you need is right
in there, including instructions.

07:09.220 --> 07:12.008
Once it's mixed together,
just rub it into his fur,

07:12.140 --> 07:13.847
or wherever there's irritation.

07:14.180 --> 07:16.763
Thank you. And Fernando thanks you.

07:17.310 --> 07:18.675
See you at the tavern tonight?

07:18.810 --> 07:24.055
No. After work, I'm playing nine with
Larry and... I've got other stuff.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.766
-Hot date?
-What?

07:26.690 --> 07:27.680
No.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.408
Are you OK? You look stressed.

07:31.530 --> 07:34.067
I'm not sleeping.
It's the crows in my neighborhood.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.861
They wake me up. They're everywhere.

07:36.620 --> 07:38.281
Signs and symbols, Ernie.

07:40.540 --> 07:42.827
The augury of birds, man! Come on.

07:43.290 --> 07:47.454
Paracelsus says this sort of thing
usually foretells doom.

07:49.460 --> 07:50.461
Fantastic.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.172
I mean... that's just an FYI.

07:57.350 --> 07:58.465
Ernie, my friend!

07:58.600 --> 08:00.170
I'm not your friend today.

08:00.310 --> 08:02.597
This is a search-and-destroy mission.

08:02.730 --> 08:04.391
You can count our brass.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.352
Pete says we need stops
and connectors.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.721
-Nickel and dime.
-It's a golden age.

08:08.860 --> 08:11.943
Captain's doing that infill
in Torrance. Fifty units.

08:12.070 --> 08:14.357
Half the plumbers
bidding that job buy from you.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.322
It's on hold.
I heard Captain's getting sued.

08:17.450 --> 08:20.112
He's always getting sued.
He's a rapacious son of a bitch.

08:20.790 --> 08:23.111
But when that suit goes away -

08:23.250 --> 08:26.333
and it will - you're gonna need stock
on your shelves.

08:26.790 --> 08:29.543
Or do you want to hang your plumbers
out to dry with Captain?

08:29.670 --> 08:34.005
Not a good idea... with Orbis
about to shut its doors for good.

08:34.130 --> 08:36.712
-What are you hearing about all that?
-Just rumors.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.386
But with all that acreage,
all those hangars

08:39.510 --> 08:41.672
and factories and office buildings,

08:41.809 --> 08:45.599
Orbis is the last big redevelopment
project in Long Beach,

08:45.730 --> 08:48.392
and I guarantee Captain
will be in the middle of it.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.107
Orbis. Well, that bums me out.

08:54.110 --> 08:57.273
My dad was a mechanic there
a million years ago.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.117
My father was a janitor there.

09:00.620 --> 09:01.860
Graveyard shift.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.200
OK, Ernie.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.746
-Write it up.
-Already did.

09:09.630 --> 09:10.745
Give me the P.O.

09:14.970 --> 09:16.290
Let me ask you something.

09:18.220 --> 09:19.847
You ever actually met Captain?

09:20.600 --> 09:21.590
Of course.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.972
I know everybody.

09:29.690 --> 09:32.273
Hey! Listen, good news.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.942
I can get square
by the end of the month.

09:35.070 --> 09:36.981
I've got a nice commission coming.

09:38.070 --> 09:38.901
What?

09:39.410 --> 09:40.400
No.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.367
Come on, man.
I just need a couple of weeks.

09:44.870 --> 09:45.860
Hello?

09:46.920 --> 09:47.910
Hello?

09:49.330 --> 09:50.331
Damn.

09:56.170 --> 09:57.171
Hey!

09:58.180 --> 09:59.466
Nice try!

09:59.590 --> 10:01.592
This is a Cadillac!

11:33.400 --> 11:34.390
Hello?

11:39.990 --> 11:40.980
Hello?

12:21.650 --> 12:23.982
You're looking at 600 square feet.

12:24.700 --> 12:25.770
Really?

12:25.910 --> 12:27.366
Well, give or take.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.242
And all-new fixtures in the kitchen,

12:30.370 --> 12:31.576
more or less.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.458
Does that bottle of Jim Beam
come with the apartment?

12:34.580 --> 12:35.570
Christ.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.957
Sean, are you here?

12:40.460 --> 12:41.461
Sean!

12:52.430 --> 12:53.431
Hey, Mr. Lang!

12:53.560 --> 12:55.938
Hi, Sean.
Could you please get the hell out?

12:56.060 --> 12:57.642
I'm sorry. Yeah, leaving now.

12:57.770 --> 12:59.181
-I'll get my stuff.
-But wait.

12:59.690 --> 13:00.680
Dud?

13:03.110 --> 13:04.350
-Beth?
-Yeah.

13:05.530 --> 13:06.520
Well, long time.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.617
Yeah! Tim, this is Sean Dudley.

13:08.740 --> 13:11.493
He was my date
to homecoming, senior year.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.208
Yeah, don't worry about it.
We didn't get very far.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.377
I blew him.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.247
I've got another showing
in ten minutes.

13:21.380 --> 13:23.417
So, how are you?

13:25.010 --> 13:26.250
-I'm great!
-Yeah?

13:26.380 --> 13:27.757
Do you live here?

13:27.890 --> 13:29.255
-He did.
-Yeah, yeah.

13:29.390 --> 13:31.097
Since no one took my apartment,

13:31.220 --> 13:32.802
I kind of just hang out.

13:33.310 --> 13:36.223
Kind of be like a caretaker
for the property.

13:36.350 --> 13:38.762
Yeah, last I heard,
you had moved to Mexico

13:38.900 --> 13:40.061
and you were surfing.

13:40.190 --> 13:42.431
No, no, no.
I took a trip to Nicaragua.

13:43.860 --> 13:46.022
I didn't stay for very long, though.
It was...

13:46.150 --> 13:48.699
Yeah, somebody told me
that you got attacked by a shark.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.276
A shark? I wish!

13:50.830 --> 13:52.036
No, it was a...

13:52.620 --> 13:54.497
It was... like a...

13:54.620 --> 13:56.406
You know, like a thing...

13:56.540 --> 13:59.202
It doesn't matter. It's a long story.
What's new with you?

13:59.880 --> 14:01.120
You know, nothing.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.622
-We got engaged last weekend.
-Oh, right!

14:04.760 --> 14:06.626
Of course. Oh, God, I'm sorry.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.172
I'm the worst. Yes. Look!

14:09.720 --> 14:12.382
We should celebrate!
What are you guys doing after this?

14:12.510 --> 14:14.217
We both have to get back to work.

14:14.350 --> 14:16.170
Oh, right. Right, right. Yeah.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.893
But, I mean, like, you know,
later on in the evening.

14:19.850 --> 14:20.897
-OK.
-Really?

14:21.020 --> 14:22.681
Yeah? Really?

14:23.480 --> 14:24.470
Great!

14:25.610 --> 14:28.910
-Cool. That's great. All right.
-Should I get your number?

14:29.030 --> 14:32.239
No, don't worry about it.
I'll be at Donuts. You can just...

14:32.370 --> 14:34.737
You just stop on by,
you guys can meet me there,

14:34.870 --> 14:37.999
and then we'll, you know,
figure out a plan from there.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.417
Does that sound good?

14:39.540 --> 14:41.702
-Yeah, Donuts. That's good.
-If--

14:41.840 --> 14:43.080
-Good. Great.
-Great.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.338
OK. Mr. Lang, see you later.

14:45.460 --> 14:47.337
-Yeah, you, too, Sean.
-OK.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.791
If you come back here,
I'll call the police.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.216
Yeah, you got it.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.380
Behold the maestro.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.840
Oh, shut the hell up.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.219
Beautiful!

15:11.990 --> 15:13.446
You sliced it a little.

15:14.450 --> 15:15.531
What the hell, dude?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.030
Fore!

15:19.710 --> 15:21.997
-Damn hack!
-Look around you, son.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.410
This ain't Pebble Beach.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.341
Remember, I'm five strokes up.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.892
Three strokes, you lying bastard.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.772
I don't need this crap. I'm fine.

15:47.900 --> 15:51.234
Listen, that kid I told you about,
he's coming tomorrow morning.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.350
OK.

15:52.490 --> 15:55.232
You need to be there, to let him
inside and show him what to do.

15:55.370 --> 15:57.532
No problem, Larry. Don't sweat it.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.292
Right here, Alice.

16:10.050 --> 16:11.120
Right here.

16:11.260 --> 16:13.968
The Tongva Indians
lived right where I'm standing

16:14.090 --> 16:16.809
for 3,000 years.

16:16.930 --> 16:20.514
For 3,000 years they had
the whole coastline to themselves,

16:20.640 --> 16:25.601
from Palos Verdes all the way down
to Rancho Crapola, or whatever.

16:26.190 --> 16:30.184
Anyway, pretty much
all they did was, like, fish

16:30.320 --> 16:31.776
and then hang out on the beach.

16:32.490 --> 16:34.276
For 3,000 years, Alice.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.526
I don't think that's true.

16:36.660 --> 16:39.482
Well, according to my research,
it pretty much is,

16:39.620 --> 16:40.610
SO...

16:41.080 --> 16:43.572
Then the Spanish had to come along
and ruin everything.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.627
Are you waiting for somebody?

16:50.760 --> 16:51.750
Yeah.

16:52.260 --> 16:53.250
Yeah.

16:55.550 --> 16:57.006
Yeah, they should be here soon.

17:12.069 --> 17:14.482
I can't believe I'm doing this shit.

17:17.530 --> 17:19.612
So, are you coming right here after,

17:19.740 --> 17:21.481
or are you filing from the office?

17:22.119 --> 17:23.109
What?

17:23.960 --> 17:26.667
No. No,
I've been keeping him off the bed.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.739
Take a Claritin.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.622
Come on!
Come on, it's our anniversary!

17:35.220 --> 17:37.086
You're damn right
I'm calling it that.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.006
I bought a romantic candle.

17:39.930 --> 17:42.467
Bay Leaf Irish Moss or some shit.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.049
Fine.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.760
We'll go to the Conquistador.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.350
Can I help you?

18:01.200 --> 18:02.281
Oh, shit.

18:03.330 --> 18:05.150
I'll find you next week for the rest.

18:06.290 --> 18:08.201
Two grand, OK?

18:08.960 --> 18:09.950
I can get it.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.586
The English language is dead.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.092
I'm serious!
All the good copy editors are gone.

18:21.220 --> 18:22.881
It's chaos! Look!

18:23.010 --> 18:25.229
They mangled half my sentences

18:25.350 --> 18:28.092
and cut, like,
five graphs from the middle.

18:28.230 --> 18:29.641
None of this makes sense!

18:30.190 --> 18:32.431
Bunch of sober 25-year-olds.

18:34.190 --> 18:35.021
Hey!

18:36.490 --> 18:37.560
Am I boring you?

18:37.700 --> 18:40.488
You usually
find my rants enthralling.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.610
I do!

18:41.740 --> 18:42.980
More than anything.

18:43.740 --> 18:46.118
Is something wrong?
You've been a little far away.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.240
No.

18:47.370 --> 18:48.360
I...

18:49.370 --> 18:51.122
just don't have any vowels.

18:55.670 --> 18:57.911
Last month, I made a few dumb bets.

18:58.050 --> 18:59.757
Ernie! You said...

18:59.880 --> 19:00.881
I know. I know.

19:01.010 --> 19:02.000
Stupid.

19:03.300 --> 19:06.634
Work was slow. I was just trying to
pick up the slack. It will be fine.

19:08.020 --> 19:10.307
And then there's Larry.

19:11.270 --> 19:13.477
-Are you worried? You said he's fine.
-He is.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.100
Hell, the dude's immortal!

19:16.150 --> 19:18.482
He's been promising to step down
for a decade now.

19:18.610 --> 19:21.489
"Get ready, Ernie. I'm sending you
on the Grand Tour next year."

19:21.990 --> 19:23.230
Next year never comes.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.532
Stop whining!
It's unattractive in a man!

19:27.120 --> 19:28.497
Place is falling apart.

19:29.410 --> 19:31.117
I heard he's getting carpets cleaned.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.493
I'm 59, still living check to check.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.913
I've got nothing to show
for the last ten years.

19:39.050 --> 19:40.256
No security, no--

19:40.380 --> 19:42.257
What do you want?
You want a pep talk?

19:42.390 --> 19:44.631
Just once,
I want to be in charge of something.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.671
-I want to leave my mark.
-Hubris.

19:46.810 --> 19:49.802
Hell, yeah! I want
my goddamn portrait on the wall!

19:58.530 --> 20:01.238
A year ago,
you came back into my life.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.810
I never thought I'd see you again.

20:10.620 --> 20:12.031
Oh, God! Is that the time?

20:13.460 --> 20:14.450
Geez!

20:14.920 --> 20:15.910
Sorry.

20:16.670 --> 20:18.297
Scott's on a new schedule.

20:18.420 --> 20:20.297
No, no, no. I get it.

20:22.090 --> 20:22.921
Hey.

20:36.690 --> 20:38.226
Did you call your sister back?

20:38.900 --> 20:40.857
-No.
-How much do you owe her?

20:40.990 --> 20:42.196
A few grand.

20:42.820 --> 20:44.777
She paid off the loan
that I took off Burt.

20:45.530 --> 20:47.407
-I'm gonna pay her back.
-How?

20:48.280 --> 20:49.941
Three thousand years, Alice.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.453
Three thousand years.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.877
We don't have to live like this.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.240
You know?

21:00.800 --> 21:02.416
Got to be another way.

21:44.880 --> 21:45.927
Carlos, he's back.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.250
Get out of here, now!

21:48.390 --> 21:50.347
-Mom?
-Go back inside.

21:50.470 --> 21:51.460
This is our house.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.630
You guys are vultures.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.727
-We paid for this house!
-Yeah.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.187
In a foreclosure sale.

21:59.690 --> 22:00.725
No. No!

22:11.530 --> 22:12.782
Here we come!

22:13.290 --> 22:14.940
) _ -Lizzy!
Coming to get you!

22:16.370 --> 22:17.360
Come on, Dad!

22:17.500 --> 22:18.535
-You ready?
-Yeah.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.910
One, two, three!

22:30.550 --> 22:31.381
Hey!

22:32.640 --> 22:33.459
Sorry!

23:25.570 --> 23:26.640
No!

23:31.950 --> 23:33.111
God damn it.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.416
Oh, no.

25:04.540 --> 25:05.530
Hello?

25:06.500 --> 25:07.490
Hel--

25:08.630 --> 25:10.416
Hello? Is there anybody in there?

25:12.840 --> 25:15.889
Hello? Is there anybody...
Is there anybody in there?

25:18.430 --> 25:19.716
Been waiting for you.

25:21.310 --> 25:22.300
What?

25:22.770 --> 25:24.260
Are you here to do the carpets?

25:24.980 --> 25:25.799
No.

25:26.690 --> 25:29.398
Sorry. There's supposed to be
a guy coming to do the carpets.

25:32.530 --> 25:33.941
I found this on the beach.

25:34.700 --> 25:35.690
OK.

25:36.450 --> 25:37.440
Cool.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.652
I'll ask around,
see who this belongs to.

25:41.330 --> 25:42.320
Thank you.

25:45.500 --> 25:46.490
Are you OK?

25:50.590 --> 25:51.796
What's inside?

25:54.260 --> 25:55.921
Come inside, see for yourself.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.561
You have your own tavern?

26:14.940 --> 26:15.941
Full bar.

26:16.490 --> 26:18.527
Domestic and imported beers on tap.

26:20.490 --> 26:21.480
Nice!

26:22.410 --> 26:23.400
Nice!

26:29.790 --> 26:30.780
What's wrong?

26:30.920 --> 26:33.742
Nothing. I just feel like
I've been here before.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.791
I remember the Throne Room.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.058
Yeah, well, we rent that out
for various functions.

26:48.600 --> 26:52.264
Maybe you were here
for a wedding reception or a funeral.

26:52.770 --> 26:53.760
How do I join?

26:55.280 --> 26:58.147
I'm sorry.
I'm probably doing this all wrong.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.317
It's a big secret thing, isn't it?

27:00.450 --> 27:02.157
Actually, no, it's not.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.941
All you have to do to join is ask.

27:04.080 --> 27:08.404
We are obligated by tradition to give
anyone who's serious a chance.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.490
Can I join?

27:12.960 --> 27:15.372
OK. Well, what's your name?

27:15.500 --> 27:17.502
-Dud.
-Is that your Christian name?

27:17.630 --> 27:20.213
Sean. It's Sean Dudley. Yeah.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.097
-Ernie Fontaine.
-Mr. Fontaine.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.057
It's very nice to meet you.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.379
And...

27:27.310 --> 27:29.847
-Women can join, too. That's--
-Yeah. Negroes, too.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.010
I... It's not...

27:33.560 --> 27:36.780
I was just giving you a hard time.
Come on, let's go into the office.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.520
OK.

27:39.650 --> 27:42.654
I hate to admit it, but someone
asking to join is rare these days.

27:42.780 --> 27:43.611
Really?

27:43.740 --> 27:45.822
Our membership's
been declining for years.

27:45.950 --> 27:48.362
Maybe this is a good sign
we need to get younger.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.457
I'll just need your contact info.

27:51.210 --> 27:54.032
Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. OK.

27:56.000 --> 27:56.990
So...

27:57.800 --> 28:01.589
like, what is it
that you guys do here?

28:01.720 --> 28:04.462
Community services,
recreational activities.

28:04.970 --> 28:07.257
Plus, there's a whole
philosophical component -

28:07.390 --> 28:09.597
alchemical,
or whatever you want to call it.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.552
But, mainly, we just get together.
Tonight's Bunco night.

28:13.690 --> 28:15.647
Well, that sounds great!

28:15.770 --> 28:17.977
You do understand
we may not take you?

28:18.280 --> 28:21.238
For all I know, you could be
some kind of deadbeat or psycho.

28:21.780 --> 28:23.771
I'm definitely not a psycho, so...

28:24.370 --> 28:25.860
This will give you the basics.

28:26.740 --> 28:29.118
We're having a meeting Saturday
at eight o'clock.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.821
You can come and join us before
at the tavern.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.076
Come by around seven.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.990
Yeah. OK.

28:36.130 --> 28:37.450
Do I need to do anything, or--

28:37.590 --> 28:39.456
No, you'll hang out
with other knights,

28:39.590 --> 28:42.673
and hopefully our
Sovereign Protector, Larry Loomis,

28:42.800 --> 28:44.507
if he's out of the hospital.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.670
OK.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.749
Well, I guess...

28:50.060 --> 28:53.553
I just need to know, like...
how much does it cost to join?

28:53.690 --> 28:54.839
Oh, yeah.

28:54.980 --> 28:55.970
Two...

28:57.770 --> 28:58.760
Two thousand.

29:03.150 --> 29:04.527
OK. Yeah.

29:04.990 --> 29:07.277
Really?
You can get your hands on two grand?

29:07.950 --> 29:09.361
When do you need it by?

29:10.910 --> 29:14.210
Forget it. If you come by Saturday,
we can figure out all that stuff.

29:14.330 --> 29:17.243
Great. Well,
I'm definitely gonna come, so...

29:17.920 --> 29:19.547
That must be the carpet guy.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.371
OK! See you Saturday.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.217
Yeah. Good to meet you.

29:23.340 --> 29:24.330
Yeah.

29:29.930 --> 29:31.887
See the order I brought in
from Boyle Pipe?

29:32.020 --> 29:33.135
I did.

29:33.640 --> 29:36.473
-It's about time.
-I was in a slump. Now I'm not.

29:37.440 --> 29:41.399
-My butter and egg man is back!
-Can you front me the commission?

29:43.240 --> 29:44.639
I need it, Bob.

29:44.780 --> 29:45.906
Pow! Like now!

29:46.030 --> 29:47.156
Not happening.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.441
The well is dry.

29:48.950 --> 29:52.159
We're waiting on payment
from about ten different wholesalers.

29:53.370 --> 29:56.283
-Come on.
-It's deadbeat city out there!

29:56.420 --> 29:58.661
No commissions until we get paid.

29:58.790 --> 29:59.780
End of story.

30:07.760 --> 30:08.579
Hey.

30:09.510 --> 30:10.796
Have you ever met Captain?

30:11.310 --> 30:12.960
Me? Never!

30:13.100 --> 30:15.512
Guys like you and me,
we don't meet Captain.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.642
We're too far down the food chain.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.101
"The lynx has powerful vision.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.823
So powerful,
it can see through walls.”

30:31.950 --> 30:32.781
Yeah, right.

30:32.910 --> 30:35.368
I meant that is what people thought
in the Middle Ages.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.400
Things were a little different
back then.

30:37.540 --> 30:39.747
-What do they even do there?
-What do they do?

30:39.880 --> 30:42.121
Well, right here it says

30:42.250 --> 30:44.662
that "the Ancient
and Benevolent Order of the Lynx

30:44.800 --> 30:47.542
seeks to perfect amongst its members

30:47.680 --> 30:50.638
the virtues of wisdom, fortitude,

30:50.760 --> 30:52.751
watchfulness, temperance,

30:52.890 --> 30:54.597
charity, and love."

30:54.930 --> 30:56.011
-Fun.
-Yeah.

30:56.140 --> 30:57.630
And they've got a full bar, so...

30:58.440 --> 31:00.431
And then, when you join,

31:00.560 --> 31:02.301
they assign you this knight,

31:02.440 --> 31:04.226
and he mentors you
as you move up grades.

31:04.360 --> 31:05.350
It's pretty cool.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.357
-Lizard!
-What is wrong with you?

31:07.490 --> 31:10.448
A guy from the sheriff's office
came by to serve you papers.

31:10.570 --> 31:12.698
That family
is taking out a restraining order.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.730
Why? They attacked me!

31:14.870 --> 31:17.362
I told you
to stay away from the house.

31:18.870 --> 31:19.860
I know.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.820
OK? I know. I just--

31:24.130 --> 31:25.291
I had a bad night.

31:26.260 --> 31:28.331
OK? Just... Listen, hear me out, OK?

31:28.470 --> 31:30.370
When I opened the door
and saw the uniform,

31:30.510 --> 31:32.467
I thought he was gonna tell me
you were dead.

31:35.220 --> 31:36.210
What?

31:38.100 --> 31:40.387
The way you've been acting lately,
I don't know,

31:40.520 --> 31:41.510
I thought...

31:42.400 --> 31:44.812
I thought maybe something
happened to you, like...

31:45.650 --> 31:47.186
maybe you jumped off a bridge.

31:48.900 --> 31:49.890
Jesus.

31:51.570 --> 31:52.696
Jesus, Lizzy.

31:55.950 --> 31:57.111
I would never.

32:04.710 --> 32:07.202
I mean,
it looks like a bunch of weirdos.

32:07.710 --> 32:09.792
No. No. No, not at all.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.507
The guy I talked to,
he's really cool.

32:13.050 --> 32:14.848
So this is your plan,

32:14.970 --> 32:17.098
instead of, like, getting a job?

32:18.350 --> 32:19.340
Well...

32:19.980 --> 32:22.130
I mean,
this is gonna open doors for me.

32:23.020 --> 32:25.648
You know? Like, secret handshakes.

32:25.770 --> 32:27.147
That's a big deal.

32:31.700 --> 32:32.690
Lizzy...

32:34.490 --> 32:36.618
My housing situation right now
is a little--

32:36.740 --> 32:38.367
-You can have the couch.
-Really?

32:39.500 --> 32:41.741
Thank you. Don't worry,
it will just be for a few--

32:41.870 --> 32:42.860
Years?

32:44.880 --> 32:46.746
At least I don't make money
off my tits.

32:47.670 --> 32:49.331
You owe my tits three grand.

32:50.130 --> 32:51.120
Yeah.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.674
I know.
But, you know, it's just money.

32:55.180 --> 32:56.921
Dud, do you know
how much I owe the bank?

32:57.350 --> 32:58.169
Yeah.

32:59.140 --> 33:00.676
But that's kind of, you know...

33:01.350 --> 33:03.136
-It's kind of your fault.
-My fault?

33:04.900 --> 33:06.186
It's Dad's fault.

33:06.310 --> 33:08.142
It's... It's nobody's fault.

33:08.690 --> 33:09.521
OK?

33:09.650 --> 33:10.640
I owe you,

33:10.780 --> 33:12.270
you owe the bank,

33:12.400 --> 33:15.358
the bank probably owes another bank.

33:15.490 --> 33:17.697
You know? I don't know.
It's the circle of life.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.787
You also owe me for the nachos.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.281
-These aren't on the house?
-Sorry bastards!

33:27.210 --> 33:28.917
Orbis plant's officially closed.

33:29.710 --> 33:32.088
Last Jupiter flew out of Long Beach
this morning.

33:33.050 --> 33:34.336
Yeah, I know. I saw it.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.290
Lizzy.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.056
I'm gonna get it back.

33:41.680 --> 33:42.670
What?

33:43.520 --> 33:44.510
All of it.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.090
The shop.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.510
The house.

33:49.310 --> 33:50.607
Dad's watch.

33:50.730 --> 33:51.720
Everything.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.679
It's all gone, Dud.

33:55.030 --> 33:56.191
Why can't you see that?

34:02.120 --> 34:04.282
I've got a good feeling
about this kid.

34:04.620 --> 34:07.248
-I think he's special.
-He just showed up?

34:07.370 --> 34:10.168
Larry hired him to do the carpets.
We got to talking.

34:10.290 --> 34:11.587
His name's Arturo.

34:11.710 --> 34:13.087
He's 25

34:13.210 --> 34:15.121
and he's running his own business.

34:15.260 --> 34:16.466
Just what we need.

34:16.590 --> 34:18.717
What about the dude
that found the ring?

34:18.840 --> 34:21.092
He won't show up. He's a bullshitter.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.511
I called the home number he left.

34:23.639 --> 34:25.472
It's for a donut shop.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.931
That sounds like a psycho.

34:28.310 --> 34:29.721
All hail the king!

34:30.230 --> 34:31.516
He's alive!

34:31.650 --> 34:32.969
You're damn right!

34:33.900 --> 34:35.436
Now, let's roll some dice.

34:38.820 --> 34:41.322
Go! Threes. Wish me luck.

34:42.449 --> 34:44.077
-Just roll.
-Yes!

34:48.830 --> 34:51.333
Hell, yeah! Way to go, baby!

34:55.550 --> 34:56.755
Ernie, you playing?

35:03.850 --> 35:04.840
Ernie.

35:09.230 --> 35:11.392
It's time for succession.

35:12.270 --> 35:15.274
I know, you've heard it before,
but I mean it.

35:16.190 --> 35:18.272
In the hospital,
I thought it would be a bummer

35:18.400 --> 35:20.698
if I checked out
before you got your chance.

35:22.410 --> 35:26.324
It's time to put your ugly mug...
on the wall.

35:28.830 --> 35:30.116
Oh, man.

35:30.250 --> 35:31.456
This is a big step.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.872
You don't even realize how big.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.296
Next couple of weeks,

35:36.420 --> 35:38.377
we've got a lot to talk about.

35:38.510 --> 35:40.922
Did you talk to London?
Is it official?

35:41.720 --> 35:44.257
London, yeah. Yeah, sure.

35:44.760 --> 35:45.750
Don't worry.

35:51.940 --> 35:53.010
-Hey.
-Hey.

35:54.610 --> 35:55.930
Why don't you sit down?

35:56.070 --> 35:57.390
Dinner's almost ready.

35:58.360 --> 36:00.522
You know,
you're not an indentured servant.

36:00.650 --> 36:02.027
You had all these avocados,

36:02.160 --> 36:04.868
so I figured I'd make
my famous seven-layer dip.

36:04.990 --> 36:06.731
Except it's a three-layer version.

36:07.910 --> 36:08.945
How was your day?

36:09.080 --> 36:12.493
My day? Oh, well, today was great.

36:13.540 --> 36:16.168
Yeah, I really feel like
the work I'm doing

36:16.300 --> 36:19.793
is having a positive impact
on the community.

36:23.340 --> 36:26.844
Well, I'll cut some limes
for vodka tonics.

36:27.220 --> 36:28.631
Fantastic!

36:31.230 --> 36:34.268
The enguacification of the avocado

36:34.400 --> 36:37.267
is one of mankind's great leaps.

36:38.570 --> 36:41.141
I swear to God, if this guy says
"man cave" one more time...

36:41.280 --> 36:43.567
They will take the one with
the finished basement.

36:43.700 --> 36:44.861
-Yeah, they are.
-No.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.732
No, they're not.
She hated the appliances.

36:47.870 --> 36:49.156
Well, she had every right to.

36:49.290 --> 36:52.157
She wanted stainless steel,
and they weren't stainless steel.

36:55.420 --> 36:57.491
Now she's complaining
about the ceilings?

36:58.460 --> 37:00.167
This bitch can burn in hell.

37:01.920 --> 37:06.130
So, do you actually think
these guys are gonna help you?

37:08.310 --> 37:09.129
Yeah.

37:10.310 --> 37:11.721
I mean, I hope so.

37:14.060 --> 37:15.221
It's...

37:15.650 --> 37:17.266
It's not even that. It's...

37:18.400 --> 37:19.219
What?

37:23.240 --> 37:24.230
I remember...

37:25.320 --> 37:28.233
this one garage sale
that Dad took us to.

37:28.950 --> 37:31.499
The people were selling
this full-length mirror,

37:31.620 --> 37:32.610
and they had it...

37:33.620 --> 37:35.110
laid out on the lawn.

37:37.500 --> 37:40.549
And I remember
standing over the mirror...

37:42.210 --> 37:45.965
and it was like
I was looking down into the sky.

37:47.180 --> 37:48.466
It was the weirdest feeling.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.342
It was like there was
this whole other world

37:51.850 --> 37:53.636
just right below us.

37:54.350 --> 37:56.057
And I wanted to jump through.

37:58.940 --> 38:01.147
That's how I felt
when I walked into the Lodge.

38:05.740 --> 38:07.276
So I have to go back.

38:15.660 --> 38:16.661
Good night.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.410
Good night.

38:26.970 --> 38:28.586
Signature loan.

38:29.010 --> 38:31.422
Three grand, minus $50 for a phone.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.052
Do you want me to go over
the terms and conditions?

38:34.180 --> 38:36.171
No, thank you. I know them by heart.

38:41.190 --> 38:43.272
Isn't this bad business for you,

38:43.400 --> 38:45.311
loaning money to a guy like me?

38:45.820 --> 38:48.733
Doesn't worry me. Your sister
will bail you out, like last time.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.197
You know what? Forget it.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.400
I feel sorry for you, Burt,

38:57.540 --> 39:00.703
because no one in this world
cares about you,

39:00.830 --> 39:03.333
and you're a dickhead,
and you're gonna die alone.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.191
Thank you. Come again.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.110
“Hello.

41:02.210 --> 41:03.917
Ernie told me to come by.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.622
Oh, you must be Arturo.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.739
No, I'm Dud.

41:09.630 --> 41:10.620
OK.

41:11.170 --> 41:12.831
Great. Welcome.

41:12.970 --> 41:15.337
I'm Blaise. Ernie will be here
in a couple of minutes.

41:15.470 --> 41:17.507
May I offer you a domestic lager?

41:17.640 --> 41:18.755
It's on the house.

41:18.890 --> 41:20.210
That would be great.

41:20.930 --> 41:22.261
Thank you. That's...

41:23.850 --> 41:26.603
You know, it's funny,
I... lived here my whole life,

41:26.730 --> 41:29.392
and I've never... noticed this place.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.682
Yeah, well, sometimes...

41:32.650 --> 41:35.278
you can't see something
until you're looking for it.

41:37.280 --> 41:38.270
Guess so.

41:38.410 --> 41:39.980
Seen and unseen, man.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.907
The kingdom is right in front of us.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.127
-You made it.
-Yeah.

41:48.040 --> 41:48.871
Hey.

41:49.380 --> 41:51.291
Man, dig your gear!

41:52.920 --> 41:54.718
-So, this is the guy?
-Yeah.

41:54.840 --> 41:57.002
Yeah, well, great job on the carpets.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.756
Thanks. What?

41:58.890 --> 42:01.211
No, this isn't Arturo.

42:01.350 --> 42:02.715
Is he here, Arturo?

42:02.850 --> 42:04.420
No. OK. Well, that's fine.

42:04.560 --> 42:07.302
This is... the other guy.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.101
-I'm Dud.
-Ben.

42:09.230 --> 42:10.857
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-All right.

42:10.980 --> 42:12.778
-Hi.
-Hi. Thank you for inviting me.

42:12.900 --> 42:14.811
-Nice to meet you.
-Where's Larry?

42:15.490 --> 42:18.653
He said he needed some time
in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.486
-Let's drink.
-All right.

42:21.790 --> 42:22.780
Hey.

42:23.910 --> 42:25.617
What's the Sanctum Sanctorum?

42:26.410 --> 42:28.742
It's a room
where Larry goes to hang out.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.739
Well, what kind of room?

42:33.920 --> 42:34.910
I don't know.

42:35.380 --> 42:37.678
Only the Sovereign Protector
is allowed inside.

42:37.800 --> 42:38.881
Oh, cool.

42:40.350 --> 42:41.920
What's the Sovereign Protector?

42:43.850 --> 42:44.885
OK.

42:45.020 --> 42:47.557
So, if you come back,
you'll be a postulant,

42:47.690 --> 42:49.260
which is a probationary phase.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.550
Then, if that goes well,
we'll make you a squire,

42:51.690 --> 42:54.819
and then you can attend meetings
and run a tab at the bar.

42:54.940 --> 42:55.930
Yeah.

42:56.070 --> 42:58.732
So, how do I become a knight?

42:59.530 --> 43:01.407
-Slow down.
-OK.

43:01.530 --> 43:05.319
No. Through valiant deeds
and glittering scholarship.

43:06.660 --> 43:08.958
Or ask Larry when he's had a few
and he'll sign off.

43:09.080 --> 43:10.627
-That's what most people do.
-OK.

43:10.750 --> 43:12.957
And people don't think less of you
if you do that?

43:13.090 --> 43:14.080
I do.

43:14.460 --> 43:16.258
OK, well,
I don't want to do it that way.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.712
This is Gil Sandoval.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.080
He's a legend at Orbis.

43:20.220 --> 43:23.178
The last 20 years, he's probably
inspected over a million holes.

43:23.720 --> 43:24.710
Holes?

43:24.850 --> 43:28.093
Riveted skin lap joints
on the Jupiter fuselage.

43:28.600 --> 43:30.056
So what are you gonna do now?

43:32.980 --> 43:33.970
Who cares?

43:34.520 --> 43:37.182
As long as I don't have to look at
another skin lap joint.

43:37.320 --> 43:40.779
Oh, and this is my band. We're
playing the Throne Room next month.

43:41.950 --> 43:44.078
Awesome. So you're Don Fab.

43:45.990 --> 43:49.073
-No. I just play drums.
-They're really good.

43:49.830 --> 43:51.491
So, Dud...

43:52.670 --> 43:54.240
I feel like I should tell you...

43:55.880 --> 43:57.757
I'm with Long Beach Harbor Patrol,

43:58.300 --> 44:00.962
and I've got the authority
to do background checks

44:01.090 --> 44:04.469
on anyone
who wants to join the Lodge.

44:06.850 --> 44:07.840
Really?

44:13.900 --> 44:14.890
Oh, my God!

44:15.020 --> 44:16.897
I think he might be hiding something.

44:17.030 --> 44:19.237
Oh, no,
I've never been arrested before,

44:19.360 --> 44:22.853
but I think the sheriff's office
might currently be looking for me.

44:40.300 --> 44:41.290
Oh, my God.

44:41.760 --> 44:42.750
Oh, my God.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.867
It's all right. It's all right.

45:13.750 --> 45:15.240
It's gonna be OK.

45:16.420 --> 45:17.410
It's gonna be OK.

45:19.840 --> 45:21.160
Here he comes.

45:21.300 --> 45:22.506
-Hey.
-Hey.

45:22.630 --> 45:25.042
Larry, I want you
to meet Sean Dudley.

45:25.470 --> 45:26.460
-Hi.
-Welcome!

45:26.590 --> 45:27.921
Nice to meet you.

45:29.850 --> 45:31.170
Tell us about yourself.

45:35.100 --> 45:36.090
Well, I'm...

45:36.230 --> 45:38.141
My name's... Dud.

45:39.690 --> 45:41.476
I grew up around here.

45:44.610 --> 45:45.600
Now I'm...

45:47.160 --> 45:50.323
just sort of doing my thing, I guess.

45:50.910 --> 45:51.900
So...

45:52.540 --> 45:53.530
So...

45:54.750 --> 45:55.569
OK.

45:55.710 --> 45:56.700
Well...

45:57.880 --> 45:59.086
Glad you're here.

45:59.670 --> 46:01.297
Ring the bells in ten, and we'll--

46:01.420 --> 46:05.004
My dad owned a pool shop.

46:05.630 --> 46:07.428
I worked there my whole life.

46:08.680 --> 46:10.808
I used to do maintenance
all over town.

46:11.350 --> 46:12.966
It was... It was pretty great.

46:14.390 --> 46:15.880
And then, last year,

46:16.020 --> 46:18.557
I took a surf trip to Nicaragua...

46:20.060 --> 46:22.188
and I got bit by a snake...

46:23.190 --> 46:25.352
and I almost died.

46:25.820 --> 46:29.029
And the wound,
it never really healed right, so...

46:30.370 --> 46:32.111
I can't really surf any more...

46:33.620 --> 46:35.861
or really do any of the things
that I used to do.

46:37.540 --> 46:41.750
And then, about a month after
I got back from my trip,

46:41.880 --> 46:43.416
my dad went bodysurfing...

46:44.550 --> 46:45.540
and he drowned.

46:47.470 --> 46:49.211
And they never found his body.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.093
So now it's just me and my sister.

46:53.430 --> 46:54.420
She's my twin.

46:56.350 --> 46:58.057
Later on, we found out that my dad...

46:58.770 --> 47:00.556
he was going broke,

47:00.690 --> 47:02.852
so the bank foreclosed on the house

47:02.980 --> 47:05.233
and we had to liquidate the shop.

47:05.360 --> 47:06.350
So we lost...

47:06.900 --> 47:08.277
Well, we lost everything.

47:09.950 --> 47:12.487
I guess you could say this year's
been kind of a bum ride.

47:14.910 --> 47:17.072
But then, a couple of days ago,

47:17.210 --> 47:19.952
I was walking on the beach...

47:20.830 --> 47:23.959
and I found a Lynx ring.

47:24.550 --> 47:27.588
And I didn't know what it was,
obviously.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.040
But then, later in the day,

47:29.800 --> 47:32.462
my car ran out of gas

47:32.600 --> 47:34.250
right in front of the Lodge.

47:35.430 --> 47:36.636
So it was...

47:36.770 --> 47:37.840
it was fate.

47:40.940 --> 47:43.307
And then,
when Ernie invited me inside,

47:43.440 --> 47:45.397
I was standing in the lobby and...

47:45.530 --> 47:46.929
I don't know, I just...

47:48.110 --> 47:50.021
just felt like
I was meant to be here.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.157
I feel like this place can help me.

47:58.830 --> 48:00.116
So, that's...

48:01.250 --> 48:03.321
I don't know how else to explain it.

48:03.460 --> 48:04.450
You don't have to.

48:05.590 --> 48:08.127
I think anyone who's here has felt...

48:09.340 --> 48:10.717
a little something like that.

48:12.550 --> 48:14.848
It's good to be reminded.

48:17.470 --> 48:18.460
Yeah.

48:19.180 --> 48:20.011
To Dud.

48:20.770 --> 48:22.090
To Dud.

48:22.230 --> 48:24.107
-Yes.
-I'll drink to that.

48:27.530 --> 48:29.316
-Damn it, Larry!
-What the heck?

48:29.440 --> 48:30.817
What the heck?

48:32.160 --> 48:33.650
-Larry!
-Are you all right?

48:34.160 --> 48:35.150
Larry!

48:35.910 --> 48:37.651
-Dial 911!
-Larry!

48:39.790 --> 48:40.780
Larry!

48:40.910 --> 48:42.321
Deep breaths. Breathe!

48:42.830 --> 48:45.379
Larry... why did you hit him?

48:45.880 --> 48:46.870
Hit who?

48:48.380 --> 48:50.041
It's all a forgery.

48:50.760 --> 48:52.467
We are not the True Lodge.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.716
Oh, God. What's going on?

48:59.430 --> 49:00.511
Unbelievable.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.821
Is Larry gonna be OK?

49:18.950 --> 49:21.191
He survived the Tet Offensive,

49:21.330 --> 49:22.707
he'll get through this.

49:23.790 --> 49:25.110
I'm sorry about tonight.

49:25.250 --> 49:26.957
I don't know what got into Larry.

49:27.090 --> 49:28.626
I think he just got confused.

49:28.750 --> 49:29.740
Hey.

49:30.460 --> 49:31.450
It happens.

49:37.140 --> 49:38.346
I almost forgot...

49:39.350 --> 49:40.715
to give you my dues.

49:40.850 --> 49:43.421
-Actually, the membership is--
-Please, please.

49:44.100 --> 49:45.397
Just give me a chance.

49:59.870 --> 50:00.860
Hey.

50:01.580 --> 50:03.617
You want to have a drink
before I lock up?

50:06.080 --> 50:07.070
Yeah.

50:07.790 --> 50:08.780
Yeah.
