01:30.632 --> 01:32.885
<i>When I was six, my grandmother died.</i>

01:35.721 --> 01:37.723
<i>My father drove us to his hometown</i>

01:37.806 --> 01:40.184
<i>of Wiggins, South Carolina
for her funeral.</i>

01:43.937 --> 01:46.899
<i>I had never met her,
so her death didn't mean much to me…</i>

01:49.651 --> 01:51.612
<i>though it made my father very sad.</i>

01:55.699 --> 01:57.659
<i>I was afraid of her in that coffin.</i>

01:58.327 --> 02:01.747
<i>She was part of something
that, even at six, I wondered about.</i>

02:02.956 --> 02:04.374
<i>The place after this one.</i>

02:10.714 --> 02:14.092
<i>I worried she was looking down
and didn't like us because we were young.</i>

04:34.107 --> 04:35.442
Where's Dr. Zicherman?

04:39.571 --> 04:40.697
Excuse me.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.325
Where's Dr. Zicherman?

04:44.618 --> 04:45.827
He's on vacation.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.914
He didn't tell you?

04:51.166 --> 04:52.167
No.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.753
That seems so unlike him.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.714
Do you see him every Tuesday?

04:58.549 --> 04:59.591
No, just--

05:00.843 --> 05:02.427
Just, you know.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.806
No, I don't know.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.810
Just if I need to.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.940
Well, that's an uncommon arrangement.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.903
How'd you know I'd be here?

05:20.779 --> 05:23.740
Routine schedule is foundational
in the doctor-patient relationship.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.034
But how did you know I'd be here?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.204
I don't understand the question.

05:30.122 --> 05:32.332
But Dr. Zicherman and I
don't have a routine.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.960
How did you know
I had an appointment today?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.421
We have a daily schedule.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.298
Your name was on it.

05:45.721 --> 05:46.722
Why are you here?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.184
Because I had an appointment.

05:50.809 --> 05:51.810
No.

05:52.728 --> 05:53.854
Why are you here?

05:57.482 --> 05:58.650
The charges involved

05:58.734 --> 06:01.778
selling unregistered weapons
and crossing state lines to do so.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.657
Why are you here?

06:07.242 --> 06:08.410
I just told you.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.371
Why are you?

06:13.415 --> 06:14.875
To treat mental illness.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.253
Came to the right place.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.051
I'm not in law enforcement.
I'm not a judge.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.887
I don't concern myself
with the crimes of the men I treat.

06:27.471 --> 06:30.307
My sole concern is
protecting their mental health.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.728
Sounds like you found
your purpose in life.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.696
Do you prefer James or Jimmy?

06:48.951 --> 06:49.952
Jimmy.

06:51.954 --> 06:52.996
Jimmy.

06:55.290 --> 06:58.627
Some people's psyches are
so much more fragile

06:58.710 --> 07:01.380
than most people
you've probably encountered in your life.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.715
Or your own, for example.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.637
How do you know anything about my psyche?

07:10.764 --> 07:15.853
I don't know much.
But I suspect you're of fairly sound mind.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.273
Good to know.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.983
But some of my patients are not.

07:21.066 --> 07:25.237
They're one wrong thought,

07:26.071 --> 07:30.993
one termite of an unhealthy idea
from losing their minds.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.370
If they break,

07:33.954 --> 07:37.165
sometimes the person they were
never comes back from the break.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.460
They become ghosts in their own bodies.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.089
Why are you telling me this?

07:49.136 --> 07:51.138
I'm asking you for compassion

07:51.221 --> 07:53.390
when you deal with
some of the men in here.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.394
Some of the men?

08:00.522 --> 08:01.773
Jimmy…

08:02.649 --> 08:03.650
Doctor.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.446
- I'm asking--
- Asking what?

08:09.489 --> 08:13.952
Are you a threat to the mental health
of any of my patients?

08:16.288 --> 08:17.289
Which patients?

08:18.790 --> 08:21.251
I'm giving you
an opportunity for candor here.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.089
I urge you to take it seriously.

08:31.678 --> 08:35.182
Which… patients?

08:59.748 --> 09:03.418
<i>After they buried my grandmother,
my father drove us to the ocean.</i>

09:06.004 --> 09:08.465
<i>It was the only time
I would ever see the ocean.</i>

09:58.557 --> 10:01.977
When they were looking
for Tricia Reitler, Larry drove Marion PD

10:02.060 --> 10:06.648
up and down these roads
over and over and over again.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.860
"I think I buried her here.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.236
No, it was here.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.779
Maybe it was there.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.282
No, I think I buried her under a tree."

10:15.365 --> 10:16.408
Exactly.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.161
That night before I take him back
to Illinois, they go back out there.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.746
Same area, same result.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.373
I think she's there. Somewhere.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.628
That's why he dragged them back out
a second time.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.755
Son of a bitch couldn't get enough of it.

10:32.925 --> 10:35.260
Let me see
if I can get my hands on these reports.

11:23.851 --> 11:24.852
All right.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.981
They took a left up here before the lake.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.197
There's nothing but fields out here.

11:40.659 --> 11:43.412
That's a nice gas station
for the middle of nowhere.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.038
Yeah.

11:47.124 --> 11:50.752
All right, there should be a haul road
right up here. Take a right there.

12:45.557 --> 12:48.018
- Well, good morning, James.
- Morning, Larry.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.479
I didn't see you yesterday.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.565
Nothing happened
that didn't happen the day before.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.984
And the day before that, right?

12:58.028 --> 12:59.404
How was your day?

12:59.488 --> 13:00.989
It was good. Thanks for asking.

13:01.657 --> 13:02.699
Gary visited.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.202
- That's cool.
- It was.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.455
Always nice to see family.
Is he into cars too?

13:09.414 --> 13:11.416
A little. Well, not like me.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.918
But the Civil War stuff?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.672
He didn't stick with it.

13:18.632 --> 13:19.716
That's a shame.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.678
He married a stinky bitch.

13:24.721 --> 13:25.722
Well…

13:25.806 --> 13:28.475
She thinks it's "playing dress-up."

13:30.435 --> 13:31.770
She said that?

13:31.854 --> 13:32.938
Oh, yeah.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.232
So I said to her-- I said,

13:35.315 --> 13:39.403
"You would be a grandmother
in Civil War times. An old hag."

13:39.486 --> 13:40.946
Nobody would fight for her.

13:42.656 --> 13:43.782
Brides were young.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.367
Unspoiled.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.913
People married younger then.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.415
Much younger. Yeah.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.670
My great-grandmother
had my grandmother when she was just 14.

13:57.588 --> 13:59.464
That was perfectly normal back then.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.926
Until the government saw
a way to make money.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.471
By raising the age of consent?

14:07.055 --> 14:08.056
Exactly.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.185
Nobody attended a high school back then.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.769
There was no such thing.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.688
But, once the government saw

14:14.771 --> 14:17.149
that there was money to be made
in high schools,

14:17.232 --> 14:19.067
well, then greed trumps all.

14:19.151 --> 14:21.570
It's not about education.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.697
- No?
- No, it's about--

14:23.780 --> 14:25.949
It's about forcing kids
to delay growing up.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.453
So that their parents can spend
every extra dime on tuition,

14:29.536 --> 14:30.746
and everyone makes money.

14:30.829 --> 14:34.208
And that's what's going to
bankrupt the country someday.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.173
You know,
I never thought about it that way,

14:41.965 --> 14:43.425
but damn.

14:44.009 --> 14:45.344
You could be onto something.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.179
You think?

14:48.514 --> 14:50.182
You got a fresh perspective.

14:51.308 --> 14:52.935
You must have heard that before.

14:54.186 --> 14:55.312
Thank you.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.484
So these brides were how young?

15:03.403 --> 15:06.198
Twelve, 13 for sure.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.536
Old enough to pee,
old enough for me. Right?

15:12.037 --> 15:13.121
That's funny.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.123
Hey…

15:17.376 --> 15:18.377
So what's the--

15:20.045 --> 15:21.713
what's the youngest you ever had?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.091
What?

15:28.470 --> 15:30.180
The youngest you ever had.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.519
You first.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.354
Why? I asked first.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.149
You first.

15:44.486 --> 15:45.487
Fourteen.

15:47.531 --> 15:48.824
Did she fight back?

15:49.324 --> 15:51.285
No. You had some fighters?

15:52.202 --> 15:53.370
How old were you?

15:55.163 --> 15:56.164
With the 14-year-old?

15:59.585 --> 16:00.878
She was a freshman.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.172
I was a senior, so I was 17.

16:03.255 --> 16:04.715
- What?
- Seventeen.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.468
Larry.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.054
Is it still dripping?

16:11.138 --> 16:12.431
Drip's turned into leaks.

16:32.951 --> 16:37.289
He had 'em drive
up and down 400 East several times.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.708
440 South is mentioned four times.

16:39.791 --> 16:43.504
So is 250 East and 375 South.

16:44.213 --> 16:45.422
This is pointless.

16:45.506 --> 16:47.716
He took 'em up and down 550 East the most.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.636
Six times the first time.
Five times the second.

16:50.719 --> 16:56.475
Okay. 550 intersects with 400
at that gas station.

16:56.975 --> 17:00.270
Maybe they stopped
for sodas and bathroom breaks.

17:02.231 --> 17:03.565
I doubt that gas station was there.

17:03.649 --> 17:04.816
That looked pretty new.

17:05.317 --> 17:06.527
So, what was there?

17:13.492 --> 17:14.617
Here it is.

17:16.703 --> 17:21.458
Construction at 550-400 intersection.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.781
Hey, there a manager around?

18:39.494 --> 18:41.705
Dale only comes in a couple times a week.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.207
The rest of the time?

18:44.124 --> 18:46.627
It's just me and Keith.
He works the 3:00 to 11:00.

18:47.211 --> 18:48.545
How long you been here?

18:48.629 --> 18:49.922
Since 6:00.

18:50.422 --> 18:52.841
No, not today.
How long have you worked here?

18:53.467 --> 18:54.468
Six months.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.971
Would you know
how long this place has been open?

18:58.847 --> 19:00.307
A few years, I think.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.309
Dale and Keith know exactly?

19:03.685 --> 19:05.562
Dale's been here since the beginning.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.439
Got his number?

19:10.609 --> 19:11.693
Thank you.

19:14.947 --> 19:16.198
You work on cars here?

19:16.782 --> 19:17.908
No, sir.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.243
Know anybody who does?

19:20.160 --> 19:21.703
Not local, no.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.127
Where's the nearest auto parts dealer
around here?

19:32.548 --> 19:35.092
I don't know. Not into cars.

19:37.553 --> 19:38.846
John Dickey though…

19:40.639 --> 19:42.224
"John Dickey though," what?

19:42.307 --> 19:43.767
He's like a Mr. Fixit.

19:44.268 --> 19:48.480
People bring him stuff to fix sometimes,
but it ain't, like, official.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.524
Uh-huh. John Dickey?

19:51.108 --> 19:53.527
John Dickey Hansen.
He runs a bait shop up the road.

19:58.574 --> 19:59.783
Okay, thanks.

20:09.126 --> 20:12.212
The manager said the station opened
in the spring of '94.

20:13.422 --> 20:17.759
He says he believes they broke ground
around midsummer of '93.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.515
Fucking Larry Hall.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.828
I heard you tried to get
some product in here.

20:47.789 --> 20:48.790
Don't do that.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.711
A shrug is a nonanswer,

20:52.794 --> 20:56.048
and a nonanswer is disrespectful.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.341
I thought about it,

20:57.424 --> 21:00.427
but it turned out
I couldn't get it in here.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.102
But let's say you had.

21:10.229 --> 21:13.440
And you used it
to dig someone out of some trouble

21:13.524 --> 21:15.025
they're having on the outside.

21:21.156 --> 21:24.201
Now, that would help them.
Maybe it'd help you.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.287
But I don't see how it would help me.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.207
I'm not sure I understand.

21:39.967 --> 21:44.221
A man who can't get help anywhere else
eventually comes to me.

21:46.098 --> 21:47.599
And then he's in my debt.

21:50.435 --> 21:53.146
My apologies. Sincerely.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.358
I fucked up. I had no idea.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.778
All right.

22:05.075 --> 22:07.536
I asked around about you. In Milwaukee.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.624
You checked out. Flying colors.

22:13.667 --> 22:18.380
Everyone knew someone who knew someone
who knew you and spoke highly of you.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.174
That's nice.

22:26.597 --> 22:31.435
But no one could remember
laying eyes on you directly.

22:34.104 --> 22:36.773
Everyone knew someone who said they had,

22:38.192 --> 22:41.236
but no one had
actually done it themselves.

22:43.030 --> 22:44.364
What do you make of that?

22:46.533 --> 22:47.868
They need to get out more.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.250
Is that what they need to do?

23:15.145 --> 23:16.355
Do you have kids?

23:17.606 --> 23:19.399
How was your week, Larry?

23:19.483 --> 23:20.984
I'm just asking.

23:21.985 --> 23:23.487
Would you describe it as productive?

23:23.570 --> 23:25.072
I'm just asking!

23:26.114 --> 23:29.618
And you have asked before.
Several times over the years.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.454
And what has been my response?

23:33.705 --> 23:35.082
I'm just curious.

23:35.791 --> 23:37.417
What has been my response?

23:38.794 --> 23:42.631
You don't discuss your personal life.

23:43.757 --> 23:44.758
Correct.

23:44.842 --> 23:47.845
That's all that I discuss.

23:47.928 --> 23:50.138
Because you are the patient,
and I am the doctor.

23:52.349 --> 23:57.521
Can't we try, like, role reversal?

23:58.105 --> 23:59.940
Isn't that therapeutic?

24:01.608 --> 24:04.319
And what would you say to me
if you were my doctor?

24:05.946 --> 24:07.739
Bitch, tell me your dreams!

24:16.164 --> 24:17.875
I bet they smell good.

24:18.959 --> 24:20.377
Your children.

24:23.005 --> 24:24.423
What's troubling you?

24:24.506 --> 24:25.507
Nothing.

24:26.091 --> 24:28.760
You often use provocation
to mask vulnerability.

24:30.888 --> 24:34.349
I'm not vulnerable. You're vulnerable.

24:36.101 --> 24:37.436
You seem agitated.

24:38.187 --> 24:39.855
I'm perfectly fucking fine.

24:40.439 --> 24:47.196
It's the best mood I've been in for years,
and you don't like it.

24:47.946 --> 24:50.032
Why wouldn't I like it?

24:50.866 --> 24:53.660
Because if I got better

24:54.244 --> 24:57.164
and I told people how,

24:57.247 --> 24:59.374
and then those people got better…

25:04.087 --> 25:05.756
you'd have no job.

25:08.467 --> 25:09.468
Then I'd retire.

25:10.677 --> 25:11.970
You-- Then you'd retire.

25:14.181 --> 25:16.642
And have tea with your daughters.

25:18.060 --> 25:22.147
Watch them bend over
to do their gardening.

25:23.315 --> 25:25.234
What's making you feel so good?

25:26.652 --> 25:27.694
My appeal.

25:29.321 --> 25:30.822
You have fresh news about it?

25:33.617 --> 25:34.618
Let's just say

25:34.701 --> 25:38.664
that there are positive signs
if you know how to read them.

25:40.749 --> 25:42.376
That would explain your affect.

25:42.876 --> 25:44.169
What's my affect?

25:45.504 --> 25:46.755
Confident.

25:48.715 --> 25:49.800
Almost cocky.

25:53.011 --> 25:57.182
Sometimes a man has
every reason to feel that way.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.479
Well, I've seen you confident before.

26:02.563 --> 26:03.564
When?

26:04.106 --> 26:08.569
When you talk about Civil War history
and engines and old car parts.

26:10.904 --> 26:12.489
I've just never seen you cocky.

26:14.575 --> 26:16.285
That seems more like your friend.

26:17.828 --> 26:18.829
What friend?

26:21.665 --> 26:22.749
You mean James.

26:24.042 --> 26:28.172
You know who I mean, Larry.
He's very charismatic.

26:28.672 --> 26:29.840
You've met him?

26:30.841 --> 26:31.967
Our paths crossed.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.888
I see what you respond to in him.

26:37.347 --> 26:41.518
He gives off the aura
of someone who's never known regret.

26:42.186 --> 26:45.022
He decides something, he does it.
He never looks back.

26:50.444 --> 26:51.862
You'd think that, but…

26:54.281 --> 26:57.201
Well, but he has known regret.

26:57.284 --> 26:58.911
He does regret things.

26:58.994 --> 27:00.746
He has known pain.

27:01.246 --> 27:06.627
But he doesn't, you know, let it warp him.

27:07.586 --> 27:12.049
Is that how you see yourself?
Warped by pain?

27:14.510 --> 27:16.053
Not lately.

27:19.556 --> 27:20.766
Because of James.

27:26.772 --> 27:27.773
I'm…

27:29.858 --> 27:31.860
I'm not alone anymore.

27:44.873 --> 27:46.625
<i>When I was in seventh grade,</i>

27:46.708 --> 27:49.294
<i>Cooper Ross told me, "You're so nice,"</i>

27:49.378 --> 27:50.712
<i>and then he turned red</i>

27:50.796 --> 27:53.298
<i>and couldn't look me in the eyes
for a few minutes.</i>

28:18.115 --> 28:19.116
Hello.

28:41.638 --> 28:42.806
Help you?

28:42.890 --> 28:44.725
Are you John Dickey Hansen?

28:45.267 --> 28:47.352
Well, you can call me JD, if you like.

28:48.437 --> 28:49.688
You sell auto parts here?

28:50.189 --> 28:53.734
Well, if I happen across something that's
worth putting an ad in the Auto Trader,

28:53.817 --> 28:54.818
I might do so.

28:55.402 --> 28:56.570
You ever meet this guy?

28:59.448 --> 29:00.490
That's Larry.

29:01.033 --> 29:02.367
So, you know him well?

29:02.451 --> 29:03.869
No, miss.

29:04.578 --> 29:07.289
He's just memorable.

29:07.372 --> 29:09.458
Those mutton chops, whatnot.

29:10.876 --> 29:12.294
Help me out with "whatnot."

29:16.632 --> 29:19.927
He's as creepy as all fuck, you know?
Excuse me.

29:20.010 --> 29:22.221
No, speak freely.

29:22.304 --> 29:24.806
Well, I sold him a pair
of slotted brake rotors

29:24.890 --> 29:27.184
for a '79 Dodge B200

29:27.267 --> 29:31.230
back about, I don't know, '92, '93.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.649
Seemed a harmless squirt of a fella.

29:34.233 --> 29:36.276
Had that look of somebody
who'd never been hugged.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.445
Not even as a baby.

29:39.863 --> 29:43.242
You know, I guess I was too kind to him,

29:43.325 --> 29:47.079
'cause he started coming back
even when he didn't need a part.

29:47.746 --> 29:52.459
Started just hanging around,
talking up the young girls.

29:53.752 --> 29:55.003
Anything ever happen?

29:55.963 --> 29:58.590
What do you mean, like bad? No.

29:58.674 --> 30:00.342
We run him off after a while.

30:01.051 --> 30:03.637
Every now and then
I wonder what ever became of him.

30:05.514 --> 30:09.017
Since you're coming around
asking about him, figure it ain't good.

30:10.269 --> 30:11.436
Why'd you run him off?

30:13.814 --> 30:15.691
He made too many of the girls
uncomfortable.

30:16.608 --> 30:17.776
Including my own.

30:20.612 --> 30:21.613
Audrey.

30:21.697 --> 30:26.118
She was a teenager then,
but Larry took a shine to her.

30:27.202 --> 30:28.912
Sure didn't sit right with me.

30:29.621 --> 30:30.706
Is Audrey around?

30:31.206 --> 30:34.626
She's in town running some errands.
Should be back soon.

30:37.004 --> 30:38.338
You mind if we wait around?

30:39.798 --> 30:40.924
Not in the least.

30:54.188 --> 30:57.566
<i>When I was 12,
my sister and I got new sneakers.</i>

31:00.402 --> 31:03.780
<i>And almost immediately,
we stepped in cow pies,</i>

31:03.864 --> 31:06.992
<i>even though our parents told us
to stay clear of that field.</i>

31:17.461 --> 31:19.463
<i>Took hours for those shoes to dry.</i>

31:25.219 --> 31:27.346
<i>I don't remember anything we talked about.</i>

31:31.058 --> 31:32.392
<i>Just that we were happy.</i>

31:40.317 --> 31:42.361
Be a good boy.
You listen to your mother.

31:42.444 --> 31:43.695
I don't wanna hear this…

31:51.078 --> 31:53.121
<i>Thank you for using DOP Connect.</i>

32:38.542 --> 32:40.210
Hang up the fucking phone!

32:43.005 --> 32:44.173
This phone?

32:54.474 --> 32:55.601
Be my guest.

32:58.395 --> 32:59.980
<i>…please enter your account number.</i>

33:08.280 --> 33:09.656
…snitch.

33:14.536 --> 33:15.913
Can't have that on the yard.

33:37.518 --> 33:38.519
…snitch.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.036
Yes, sir. I understand what you're saying,

33:56.119 --> 33:58.038
but I'm telling you
there must be a mistake

33:58.121 --> 34:00.666
because I paid that credit card myself
just last week.

34:01.875 --> 34:04.503
You're telling me that my son
can't make or receive calls?

34:04.586 --> 34:06.088
Is that what you're telling me?

34:07.840 --> 34:10.551
Okay, sir, please.

34:10.634 --> 34:15.054
How about if I give you the credit card
right here, right now, over the phone.

34:15.138 --> 34:17.014
Would you be able to connect me then?

34:19.016 --> 34:21.562
Okay. All right. Thank you.

34:21.645 --> 34:24.063
I appreciate you trying to help.

34:29.069 --> 34:32.072
Bitch. Motherfucker.

34:33.866 --> 34:35.158
Jim, I should come with you.

34:35.242 --> 34:38.704
No, hon. I'll be fine.
I just need to clear my head.

34:38.786 --> 34:41.956
Okay. Well, don't get yourself worked up.

34:42.541 --> 34:45.377
I'm taking a drive to relax,
not to get worked up.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.045
All right.

34:47.129 --> 34:49.339
Can you pick us up some Kahlúa
on your way back?

34:49.422 --> 34:50.716
Yeah, imagine that.

35:05.898 --> 35:07.065
Woodshop.

35:07.983 --> 35:08.984
What's that?

35:09.484 --> 35:10.777
Last place I saw Larry.

35:30.422 --> 35:32.132
How long you been working on those?

35:34.176 --> 35:35.469
Couple of weeks.

35:41.308 --> 35:42.518
What do you do with them?

35:45.854 --> 35:47.356
I send them home.

35:50.025 --> 35:51.026
Why?

35:53.070 --> 35:56.740
Donny said that you
almost got into a fight today.

35:56.823 --> 35:57.950
At the phones?

35:58.450 --> 36:00.285
Yeah, some con wanted the phone.

36:01.203 --> 36:04.206
There's some mess-up with my account.
I can't make calls out.

36:04.915 --> 36:06.291
But you funded the account?

36:10.921 --> 36:12.297
Maybe you made an enemy.

36:14.591 --> 36:15.592
Of who?

36:16.969 --> 36:18.804
Someone who works here.

36:19.471 --> 36:22.266
Have you had any disagreements
with anyone lately?

36:26.228 --> 36:30.649
I had some minor words
with a guard yesterday.

36:30.732 --> 36:34.278
Can't remember the guy's name,
but he was just busting my balls.

36:35.571 --> 36:36.572
About what?

36:37.072 --> 36:38.115
Nothing.

36:39.992 --> 36:41.201
It's not nothing.

36:42.953 --> 36:44.788
James, come on. It's me.

36:47.708 --> 36:49.209
It was about you, Larry.

36:52.629 --> 36:56.258
Why would some guard talk about me?

36:58.385 --> 36:59.386
He said…

37:05.434 --> 37:09.438
He said you're a kid-diddler.

37:10.439 --> 37:13.192
And a kid-killer.

37:17.321 --> 37:18.989
I don't mean to laugh, I just--

37:20.866 --> 37:23.327
A kid-diddler?

37:25.621 --> 37:28.248
I've never raped anyone in my life, James.

37:34.004 --> 37:36.840
So, what did you do?

37:37.883 --> 37:39.968
I had sex with them.

37:41.678 --> 37:42.679
Okay.

37:43.722 --> 37:45.682
And they weren't children, James.

37:45.766 --> 37:50.979
Not until recently.
I mean, not back in the 1800s.

37:51.605 --> 37:52.606
Sure.

37:56.151 --> 37:59.655
James, how many women have you fucked?

38:01.990 --> 38:04.826
- Since high school? I mean…
- No, not high school.

38:04.910 --> 38:06.328
I mean how many women have--

38:06.411 --> 38:11.667
You know, over the high school ages,
have you fucked?

38:18.131 --> 38:19.508
- Eighty.
- What?

38:21.301 --> 38:22.678
- Eighty?
- I guess.

38:22.761 --> 38:25.681
I mean, there's probably
one or two I'm forgetting about,

38:25.764 --> 38:29.643
but I'm not totally sure the figure.

38:29.726 --> 38:33.021
That's not funny, James. Is it 80?

38:33.856 --> 38:34.940
Yeah.

38:35.524 --> 38:36.608
How?

38:37.276 --> 38:40.195
How did you manage to-- How--

38:40.988 --> 38:43.490
- Do you have like a line you use?
- No.

38:44.825 --> 38:48.453
I just-- I mean, I talk to 'em.

38:49.538 --> 38:52.666
And they talk to me,
and eventually, our clothes come off.

38:52.749 --> 38:54.501
- But how?
- I just told you.

38:54.585 --> 38:56.044
No you didn't.

38:59.882 --> 39:01.383
I don't follow, Larry. I'm sorry.

39:02.926 --> 39:07.389
No woman will ever just "talk to me."

39:12.186 --> 39:13.729
But younger girls will.

39:13.812 --> 39:14.897
Some.

39:15.564 --> 39:16.565
Yeah.

39:25.699 --> 39:28.118
She was nice at first.

39:30.704 --> 39:31.747
Who's that?

39:35.292 --> 39:37.336
- Who was nice, Larry?
- Jessica Roach.

39:42.382 --> 39:45.928
Her bike had a flat,
she was driving up this gravel road.

39:46.011 --> 39:47.387
Even though she had a mountain bike--

39:47.471 --> 39:49.932
You know, rocks and gravel
mix in with each other

39:50.015 --> 39:51.725
and rocks can be sharp, so…

39:53.769 --> 39:57.689
Girls think they're so smart,
but there she was with a flat.

40:02.986 --> 40:04.238
You fix it?

40:04.321 --> 40:07.741
- Oh, no. I just offered her a ride.
- Right.

40:07.824 --> 40:13.247
They make it sound like I jump
on these girls, James, and attack them.

40:13.330 --> 40:15.832
That's not reflective of the truth.

40:15.916 --> 40:18.752
She liked talking to me. She did.

40:19.837 --> 40:23.131
I had my bike that day,
and I opened up the doors to the van

40:23.215 --> 40:24.842
and I showed her, and…

40:25.384 --> 40:28.887
I told her how much I like cycling,
and we talked about that.

40:28.971 --> 40:31.598
Sounds like you had no trouble
talking to her, Larry.

40:31.682 --> 40:32.683
None.

40:33.267 --> 40:35.477
Yeah, she was nice, like I said.

40:36.770 --> 40:38.230
Until she wasn't.

40:41.024 --> 40:42.317
She turned on you, huh?

40:44.361 --> 40:46.697
Like a rabid squirrel, just

40:50.284 --> 40:51.285
You remember why?

40:56.832 --> 40:58.500
Why are you asking?

41:03.881 --> 41:06.049
Shit, Larry,
I thought we were just talking.

41:07.634 --> 41:08.927
Is that what we're doing?

41:13.891 --> 41:15.017
That's what I'm doing.

41:22.858 --> 41:25.360
She got into my van just fine.

41:26.236 --> 41:29.615
She looked at my bike
and my cleaning supplies.

41:31.575 --> 41:37.289
She asked if I live locally,
and why I had such big burnsides.

41:37.372 --> 41:38.999
She called them sideburns.

41:42.044 --> 41:44.463
I told her about reenactments,

41:45.255 --> 41:47.549
and she asked really good questions,
you know?

41:47.633 --> 41:52.095
She was so curious and so smart.

41:55.098 --> 41:58.018
And so I kissed her.

42:01.772 --> 42:07.236
And that's when she turned mean.
Just awful, slapping me and hitting me.

42:08.153 --> 42:10.697
And I just had to rag her
with the starter fluid.

42:11.657 --> 42:12.824
I had to.

42:17.287 --> 42:19.289
So we drove for a little while.

42:19.373 --> 42:23.043
I was trying to find, like,
a nice, quiet, little place.

42:23.585 --> 42:26.129
And I did,
even though I didn't know where I was

42:26.213 --> 42:29.800
or where we were going, but I found one.

42:33.387 --> 42:34.513
Then what happened?

42:35.973 --> 42:37.891
I-- Well, I, you know.

42:39.768 --> 42:43.522
I went into the back of the van with her,
and I ragged her a few more times.

42:44.523 --> 42:45.774
She kept waking up?

42:48.777 --> 42:50.404
She scratched me.

42:51.488 --> 42:53.490
So hard. It was deep.

42:54.283 --> 42:58.245
And when I cleaned out the flesh
from under her nails later on,

42:58.328 --> 43:00.038
there was a lot of me under there.

43:00.789 --> 43:01.874
A lot of me.

43:01.957 --> 43:03.166
You have sex with her?

43:03.250 --> 43:05.627
I knew you were gonna ask that.
No-- It's weird.

43:05.711 --> 43:08.672
I don't totally remember.

43:09.506 --> 43:13.635
It was like I blacked out,
but then it was like I was in a dream

43:13.719 --> 43:17.139
where I see myself
beating on her and ragging her,

43:17.222 --> 43:18.807
beating on her and ragging her.

43:20.434 --> 43:24.396
And then I woke up,
and her clothes were off,

43:24.479 --> 43:25.898
and my clothes were off.

43:28.108 --> 43:29.401
So, I…

43:30.527 --> 43:34.323
I think we had sex together.

43:41.580 --> 43:42.956
Sure sounds like it, buddy.

43:57.971 --> 44:00.182
<i>Well, then she started to cry.</i>

44:06.772 --> 44:08.732
Sometimes they do that.

44:08.815 --> 44:10.275
They thought they wanted it,

44:11.193 --> 44:12.945
but they changed their mind
after the fact.

44:13.028 --> 44:15.155
Well, no, she was crying for her mother.

44:19.284 --> 44:20.410
She was, huh?

44:21.286 --> 44:23.288
"I want my mommy.

44:23.872 --> 44:28.001
Just take me to my mommy."

44:29.044 --> 44:30.921
I did not like that.

44:31.004 --> 44:33.340
It made me mad. It ruined everything.

44:34.007 --> 44:35.425
So, I took her out of the van,

44:35.509 --> 44:38.345
and I walked her
pretty far back into the field.

44:40.305 --> 44:43.267
And I found this tree,
and I had made this…

44:45.644 --> 44:49.606
Tool, I guess, that I had made
by putting two leather belts together.

44:50.107 --> 44:51.859
And I had this stick--

44:52.901 --> 44:56.280
Well, I told her to sit down
with her back against the tree.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.242
I didn't want to see her face, you know?

45:01.743 --> 45:02.744
And,

45:03.412 --> 45:07.499
So yeah, so then I quickly whipped
the two belts around her neck,

45:07.583 --> 45:10.961
and I squeezed and put the stick in.

45:11.044 --> 45:13.630
I just started twisting it,
like one of those…

45:16.008 --> 45:17.384
What do you call it…

45:18.385 --> 45:20.554
- Tourniquet?
- Tourniquet, exactly.

45:22.264 --> 45:23.265
Yeah.

45:24.224 --> 45:27.978
I just kept twisting
until she stopped making…

45:31.023 --> 45:32.107
You know.

45:34.484 --> 45:35.652
Sounds.

45:47.497 --> 45:49.750
Well, it sounds like
you did what you had to do.

46:03.639 --> 46:06.975
Never said anything totally gross,
just off.

46:07.476 --> 46:09.061
Always off.

46:09.978 --> 46:10.979
How?

46:12.022 --> 46:15.442
He'd be like,
"You have really pretty ankles."

46:15.526 --> 46:18.654
Or, said to me once,
"Your earlobes are very ripe."

46:18.737 --> 46:20.364
That was Larry making small talk.

46:20.447 --> 46:24.159
Other times, he'd just sit at
one of the picnic benches and just stare.

46:24.660 --> 46:27.538
And, if it got to you
like sometimes it did,

46:27.621 --> 46:30.624
you'd be like, "Larry, what's up?"

46:30.707 --> 46:33.627
And he'd be all, "Did you know
that most cleaners contain lye?"

46:34.211 --> 46:37.673
And then he'd want you to go to his van
and look at the list of ingredients.

46:37.756 --> 46:40.175
- Did you ever go?
- Fuck no.

46:40.801 --> 46:42.219
You know anyone who did?

46:43.011 --> 46:46.348
Not around here, no.
We were all creeped out by him.

46:47.099 --> 46:49.518
Then, when he started to give me stuff…

46:49.601 --> 46:50.811
He gave you stuff?

46:52.855 --> 46:54.273
A pair of earrings once.

46:55.274 --> 46:56.275
A locket.

46:56.817 --> 46:58.819
Pair of used ballet flats.

46:59.820 --> 47:00.988
Were they your size?

47:04.408 --> 47:06.785
Yep. Made it worse.

47:07.828 --> 47:09.788
No chance you kept any of this stuff?

47:10.330 --> 47:13.417
We have a lost and found sale
at the end of every season.

47:15.669 --> 47:18.213
There is one thing
that I didn't throw away.

47:50.454 --> 47:52.539
Last time we ever saw him,
he gave me that.

47:54.666 --> 47:56.877
I never rode it, not once.

47:58.003 --> 48:00.672
Every time I look at it,
it makes me wanna take a shower.

48:24.655 --> 48:26.698
<i>My mother said I was never any trouble</i>

48:26.782 --> 48:28.867
<i>except when I fixated
on something I wanted,</i>

48:28.951 --> 48:30.661
<i>like a dog on a pork chop.</i>

48:31.411 --> 48:34.122
<i>So that's what she'd call it.
My pork chop.</i>

48:35.415 --> 48:38.001
<i>When I was six,
my pork chop was a goldfish.</i>

48:38.794 --> 48:42.047
<i>When I was nine,
it was a pack of butterfly hair clips.</i>

48:42.130 --> 48:43.131
<i>Multicolored.</i>

48:43.841 --> 48:47.219
<i>But my biggest pork chop,
the one I obsessed over</i>

48:47.302 --> 48:50.180
<i>and had to wait
until my 13th birthday for,</i>

48:50.264 --> 48:52.558
<i>and still work off
five months' allowance to get,</i>

48:52.641 --> 48:56.562
<i>was a mountain bike.</i>

49:25.257 --> 49:28.802
<i>I did the math. I lived over 5,000 days.</i>

49:29.344 --> 49:32.472
<i>Over 135,000 hours.</i>

49:32.973 --> 49:34.391
<i>All that time was mine.</i>

49:36.059 --> 49:40.189
<i>You can die, but you can't un-live.</i>

49:40.772 --> 49:41.899
<i>I lived.</i>

49:42.816 --> 49:43.817
<i>Here.</i>

49:47.529 --> 49:48.530
<i>Here.</i>

49:53.493 --> 49:54.578
<i>Here.</i>

49:58.373 --> 49:59.374
<i>And here.</i>

50:01.502 --> 50:02.628
<i>It was great.</i>

50:21.688 --> 50:22.731
It's not enough.

50:23.232 --> 50:24.441
That's bullshit.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.069
Heard of chain of evidence?

50:27.152 --> 50:29.947
We have a witness
who swears Hall gave it to her.

50:30.906 --> 50:32.824
Where's the serial number of the bike?

50:33.325 --> 50:35.369
Someone burned it off with acid.

50:35.452 --> 50:39.164
There's no way to conclusively prove
that this is Jessica Roach's,

50:39.248 --> 50:42.793
unless matching fingerprints
of both Hall and Roach are found on it.

50:42.876 --> 50:46.338
And after four years,
I'm fairly confident it won't be.

50:46.421 --> 50:49.508
We have witnesses who place
Larry Hall in the area…

50:49.591 --> 50:51.218
I'm not trying a new case here.

50:51.301 --> 50:53.011
Where he claimed to have buried Reitler…

50:53.095 --> 50:55.097
I'm defending against a second appeal.

50:55.180 --> 50:58.016
And where he gave someone
Jessica Roach's bike.

50:58.600 --> 50:59.810
It's not enough.

51:02.521 --> 51:04.189
Not even close.

51:05.274 --> 51:06.650
But you did great work here.

51:07.526 --> 51:10.988
You did. This is top-fucking-notch.

51:12.281 --> 51:13.407
Hey, look at me.

51:18.662 --> 51:21.582
You did. But it's not enough.

51:22.833 --> 51:24.168
What would be enough?

51:29.381 --> 51:30.507
I don't know.

51:32.885 --> 51:33.886
But this ain't it.

52:29.274 --> 52:30.275
James?

52:33.320 --> 52:34.404
James.

52:37.533 --> 52:38.659
James, you up?

52:42.287 --> 52:43.455
Well, good night.

52:49.169 --> 52:51.046
Sleep well.
