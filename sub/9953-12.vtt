WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.450
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.586 --> 00:04.326
- I thought Tommy was the bolt-gun killer.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.212
- The real Tommy was murdered
and skinned several weeks ago.

00:07.382 --> 00:08.417
The killer assumed his identity.

00:08.592 --> 00:11.709
- He's been with us the entire time,
and I bet he still is.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.752
One of us could be the skinwalker.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.797
- The Colorado Kid is James Cogan.

00:16.975 --> 00:21.935
- I can protect your baby.
- James Cogan is... He's my son?

00:22.105 --> 00:23.060
- What's...

00:25.400 --> 00:28.858
The Colorado Kid got married.
His wife's name was Arla.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.647
But stop talking about this barn situation
like it's a done deal. It's not!

00:32.824 --> 00:33.984
- If I go into that barn

00:34.159 --> 00:37.993
when the Hunter meteor storm hits Haven,
the Troubles disappear.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.245
- I'm not lettin' Audrey
go anywhere, Duke.

00:40.415 --> 00:43.452
- You only have a few days left
before you go and we should talk about that.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.117
- If I can catch the skinwalker,

00:45.295 --> 00:48.583
then maybe he can tell me
about the barn,

00:48.757 --> 00:50.964
and the Colorado Kid, and...

00:51.093 --> 00:52.879
and me.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.878
And then maybe
I don't have to go away.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.299
- Audrey, hush.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.430
- He said, "Hush."

00:59.560 --> 01:01.471
- Hush, sweetie.
How bad can it be?

01:01.645 --> 01:03.476
What I mean is...

01:07.609 --> 01:09.474
What gave me away?

01:17.995 --> 01:20.737
- You killed her.
You killed Claire.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.657
- She was a fighter.
I can see why you two got along.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.205
-VVhen?
- A few days ago.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.453
- We were still working together then.
How did--

01:29.631 --> 01:32.998
- She taped all of your sessions.
She kept excellent notes.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.046
I wish everyone made it that easy.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.051
- You're a monster.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.425
- No...

01:41.184 --> 01:42.685
I'm the victim.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.555
- Who are you?

01:44.688 --> 01:46.724
- It took me a long time to believe
that you don't remember

01:46.898 --> 01:50.231
who you are,
what you did when you were Lucy.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.397
- I don't remember any of it.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.986
So tell me.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.985
Tell me, what do you want with the barn,
the Colorado Kid?

01:58.160 --> 02:00.025
What do you want with my son?

02:03.707 --> 02:05.572
- Your son knows
how to stop the Troubles.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.119
- What?

02:08.587 --> 02:09.417
Ah!

02:16.970 --> 02:18.881
- Parker?

02:21.975 --> 02:24.762
(moans)

02:27.731 --> 02:28.595
(gunshot)

02:30.400 --> 02:32.516
Parker!
(groans)

02:32.944 --> 02:35.071
Hey, what happened?

02:35.197 --> 02:36.562
- The skinwalker.

02:38.325 --> 02:42.409
lt's wearing Claire...
and has been for days.

02:45.374 --> 02:49.993
- Audrey, how come it didn't kill you
when it had the chance?

02:50.962 --> 02:52.168
- Nathan...

02:55.300 --> 02:56.380
It's me.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.418
You feel me, right?

03:03.141 --> 03:05.928
I think that it wants
to keep me alive.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.393
Something about the barn.
I don't... I don't know.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.808
She said that my son
knew the answers.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.977
That he could stop the Troubles.
- How?

03:13.110 --> 03:14.350
- I don't know.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.351
- Then we'll find him.
- I'm out of time.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.853
- No, you're not.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.401
The skinwalker's gonna have
to lose Claire's skin now

03:20.534 --> 03:22.115
in order to stay hidden.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.701
We just have to figure out
who it's gonna be wearing next.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.368
- Yeah.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.628
(panting)

03:52.399 --> 03:55.015
(rattling)
(screams)

03:57.362 --> 03:59.603
(rattling)

04:09.833 --> 04:10.868
(indistinct radio chatter)

04:11.042 --> 04:13.909
- Poor kid must've got caught
when the bleachers retracted.

04:16.298 --> 04:19.040
Snagged his dad's wallet
to buy beer or something.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.760
- Paul Sullivan.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.720
He was in my graduating class.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.556
- You mean his dad was.
- No, I mean that is Paul.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.221
He should be my age,

04:30.353 --> 04:32.605
but that's exactly what Paul
looked like at 17.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.141
- Is he Troubled?
-|dunno.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.060
But my gut says yes.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.518
- Wait, is this your class reunion?

04:40.238 --> 04:41.648
- Yeah.
- Whoa, whoa, folks, folks.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.563
Can't come this way.
- Oh, no.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.116
- Ah...
- Are these some of your classmates?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.777
(man): I said no.
- Mean girl, class dork,

04:48.914 --> 04:52.406
prom queen, although it looks
like she's gained a few pounds.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.157
Haven High's own little Breakfast Club.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.830
- Nathan!

04:56.922 --> 04:58.412
It's been ages!
- Wow.

05:01.259 --> 05:05.252
- This is, uh, Denise, and Robbie...

05:05.430 --> 05:07.671
- Uh, | go by Robert now.
Yeah.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.139
- Robert.
- Mm-hmm.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.425
- Jeanine.
- Hi.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.222
- Detective Audrey Parker.
- Hi.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.522
- Hello.
- Hi.

05:14.689 --> 05:18.056
- Can you believe
this is the same Robbie?

05:18.193 --> 05:20.354
(chuckles)
And he's a millionaire!

05:20.487 --> 05:22.569
- I'm a motivational speaker.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.279
Perhaps you've seen my infomercials?

05:26.451 --> 05:28.487
- You would not believe what a dork
this guy was in high school.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.119
- Denise!
- Like he doesn't know!

05:31.248 --> 05:35.617
- The past always informs us,
but it never controls us.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.494
- Mm.
- That's one of mine.

05:39.256 --> 05:42.464
- Um, do you know,
is Paul Sullivan back in town?

05:42.634 --> 05:44.499
- Yeah, we all had dinner last night.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.964
- And I almost punched him in the head
for how he treated you.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.429
- What happened?
- Jeanine was acting like

05:49.599 --> 05:51.885
they were gonna hook up or something.
I mean, really?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.551
Like that would happen.
- Well, I wasn't...

05:55.772 --> 05:56.978
What is going on?

05:57.148 --> 05:59.184
We have to set up
for the dance tonight.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.816
- There's been an accident.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.352
(cellphone ringing)

06:04.322 --> 06:05.858
- Wuornos.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.826
We'll be right there.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.991
(beeping)
We have to go back to the station.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.489
Um, really nice to see you.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.831
(Robert): Nice to see you.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.492
- Are you just trying to get out
of your reunion?

06:18.628 --> 06:20.789
- No. It's about the skinwalker.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.875
(Audrey): We got you together
because you're the only people

06:23.008 --> 06:24.589
we know we can trust.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.676
- When we discovered the skinwalker
was stealing parts of women's faces,

06:27.846 --> 06:30.007
we started a computer program
to piece together

06:30.181 --> 06:32.172
what it would look like
if the parts were assembled.

06:32.350 --> 06:35.137
Now that we just got the final
ID of the woman

06:35.312 --> 06:37.052
buried near the cannery--
- We can finally get a picture

06:37.230 --> 06:39.346
of who the skinwalker's
been building.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.688
- Excuse me.

06:40.817 --> 06:44.230
Um... why isn't Claire here for this?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.187
- Claire...

06:48.909 --> 06:50.319
Claire's dead.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.076
- The skinwalker took her.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.533
- We gotta get that son of a bitch.
- We will.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.330
- And it's gonna pay.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.537
- Program's almost finished.

07:09.888 --> 07:12.004
- That's impossible.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.506
Arla Cogan?
- Who?

07:14.643 --> 07:16.008
- No, it can't be.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.884
- When Duke and l were in Colorado,

07:18.021 --> 07:22.264
we found out that James Cogan...
was married.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.437
- The skinwalker's building
your son's wife.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.217
(theme music)

08:19.833 --> 08:23.041
Why would the skinwalker
wanna look like James Cogan's wife?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.545
- Maybe it always was her.

08:24.963 --> 08:28.046
After James died, nobody in Colorado
ever saw Arla again.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.041
- Maybe she came to Haven with James,
never left.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.838
- We'll go through the archives.
- Yeah.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.678
See if there were any women
skinned 27 years ago.

08:35.807 --> 08:38.139
- See if some of your business connections
might know something.

08:38.309 --> 08:41.051
- Yeah, they just might.
Let me spread the word.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.390
(distant phone ringing, chatter)

08:44.190 --> 08:48.308
- The skinwalker has the answers,
so we need to find her before...

08:49.154 --> 08:53.147
- Before I disappear for 27 years.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.401
Well, this will be
a mighty cold case by then,

08:57.537 --> 08:59.402
so we better wrap it up.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.159
And, please...

09:06.796 --> 09:08.752
We've seen what she's capable
of doing, so just...

09:12.552 --> 09:14.088
be careful.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.050
(dreamy pop ballad)

09:23.229 --> 09:25.971
- Here's the last case.
I'll be back later.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.768
Got some stuff I gotta take care of.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.017
- Duke! There you are.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.064
lt's Jeanine.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.028
- I'm sorry, I, uh...

09:34.199 --> 09:36.406
- Come on, it hasn't been that long,
has it?

09:37.577 --> 09:38.783
- Jeanine!
- Yes!

09:38.912 --> 09:40.948
- Right, the... the... the reunion.
- Yeah!

09:41.122 --> 09:44.580
- I'm sorry. How... how are you?
It's been a long time.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.416
- I'm doing good.
I like your place.

09:47.545 --> 09:51.129
Do you... run it with your wife?

09:51.257 --> 09:54.294
- No, no.
No wife for me.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.839
- Really?

09:56.971 --> 09:59.053
The way all those girls
used to chase you.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.136
- Oh...
- If I remember correctly,

10:02.268 --> 10:05.886
I think I caught you once or twice.

10:06.022 --> 10:09.355
- Yeah, those were crazy times
backthen.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.896
- That's the good thing about reunions.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.685
It's a chance to make
some new memories.

10:13.863 --> 10:14.943
- But the old ones were so nice.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.654
(giggIeS)
(chuckles nervously)

10:16.783 --> 10:20.401
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.703
- Hello, Duke.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.368
You know who I am?
- Arla.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.922
- Can we talk privately?

10:38.054 --> 10:41.012
- Duke, aren't you gonna introduce us?

10:42.684 --> 10:43.799
- No.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.559
Jeanine, drinks are on me.
It was nice to see you.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.013
- There's an awful lot of people in here.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.186
And you know what I'm capable of.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.852
So I suggest you hear me out.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.567
(door closes)

11:02.996 --> 11:04.782
- Can I get you something
stronger than that?

11:04.914 --> 11:06.700
- No. Duke's a jerk,

11:06.875 --> 11:11.118
and l have no intention of further supporting
his crummy establishment.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.456
- Wow.

11:14.007 --> 11:14.996
Huh!

11:15.175 --> 11:17.917
- So, Arla...

11:19.679 --> 11:20.794
What do you want?

11:20.972 --> 11:23.634
- Oh, you know,
what everyone else wants.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.600
Love, life, pursuit of happiness.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.515
And Audrey,

11:32.233 --> 11:33.734
I want her to find the barn.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.647
- Why?
- The same reason you should want her to.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.815
So we can all go back
to being normal.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.397
- Yeah, but...

11:43.870 --> 11:47.078
it's gonna be a much longerjourney back
for some of us.

11:48.499 --> 11:51.332
- I didn't ask for this, Crocker,

11:51.461 --> 11:53.827
any more than you asked
for your family legacy.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.962
But together,
we can make it stop.

11:57.133 --> 11:57.997
- By trapping my friend

12:00.887 --> 12:02.923
- Yes, I know how you feel about Audrey.

12:03.097 --> 12:06.305
(scoffs)
l was Claire, remember?

12:06.434 --> 12:07.674
You know what?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.391
She loves Nathan.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.849
You really want to spend the rest
of your life

12:12.982 --> 12:15.689
killing Troubled people, hmm?

12:15.818 --> 12:19.151
Wondering which Guard has that tattoo
you see just before you die?

12:20.823 --> 12:24.031
And all for a woman
you can never have.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.075
- You're not wearing Claire.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.495
So you're not allowed
to shrink me.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.412
- Audrey going back in the barn
is just a part of the cycle.

12:36.547 --> 12:40.381
Hey, like Lucy and Sarah
and who knows how many others.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.178
But they all go back in the barn.

12:46.391 --> 12:49.633
- So then why are you so worried
that Audrey won't?

12:49.769 --> 12:53.557
- You and Nathan.
You're thinking about stopping her, right?

12:55.316 --> 12:57.728
It's the way that it has to be.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.772
And deep down,
you know that that's true.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.814
(indistinct chatter)

13:03.992 --> 13:05.277
(Duke sighs)

13:11.624 --> 13:15.287
- What exactly do you want from me?

13:21.301 --> 13:22.666
- Aha!

13:22.844 --> 13:26.507
The day after the Colorado Kid died,
a young woman went missing.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.879
A few months later,

13:28.057 --> 13:31.094
body was found not far
from our old fishing shack.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.889
- Where we found Tommy.
- The coroner's report stated

13:34.022 --> 13:35.978
that the woman's body
was badly scalded,

13:36.107 --> 13:38.314
or maybe burned by chemicals.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.396
- That's why Tommy said he liked the place.
Sorry he had to burn it down.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.938
- But that was Arla talking to us then,
not Tommy.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.110
She was in Haven before,

13:47.243 --> 13:50.235
and our shack was where
she skinned her first victim.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.111
- Mm.
(bell jingles)

13:55.418 --> 13:57.875
You talk to the Guard?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.585
- | just left Kirk.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.875
- I didn't think you two spoke anymore.
- We don't.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.507
He told me they were keeping
a close eye on Audrey.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.545
They're also following around Nathan and Duke
in case they decide to interfere.

14:08.723 --> 14:12.841
- With Audrey going into the barn?
What's the Guard gonna do?

14:17.190 --> 14:20.227
- Huh, and people say
we're tight-lipped.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.733
(door closes)

14:22.904 --> 14:26.522
- If the Guard's worried about Nathan
and Duke, maybe Arla is.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.864
Maybe she's keepin' tabs on them too.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.201
- So?
- Maybe that's how we find her.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.411
(Nathan): Parker,
meet me at the high school.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.531
There's been another murder.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.409
First Paul, now Denise.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.456
Both transformed back into teenagers.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.087
Both dead.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.797
- So what?
Somebody's Trouble is turning

14:44.926 --> 14:47.759
their classmates back
into high-schoolers?

14:47.887 --> 14:50.469
Some twisted way of returning
to a happier time?

14:50.640 --> 14:52.756
- Or an unhappier time.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.632
It's not the transformation
that's killing them.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.179
They're being murdered.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.936
- Okay, so it's some kind of revenge.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.021
- You remember high school.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.684
Uh... sorry.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.649
- I'll have you know Audrey Parker
was pretty popular.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.522
At least that's how I remember it.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.818
- Why don't you let me take this?
You got a lot of things to worry about.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.695
- Listen, we have everybody
we know out there

15:15.873 --> 15:17.989
looking for the skinwalker, all right?

15:18.167 --> 15:19.748
lf somebody's going after
your classmates,

15:19.877 --> 15:22.994
that means that you and Duke
could be in danger.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.122
We need to figure out
who's doing this.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.624
Besides, if I only have a day left...

15:29.679 --> 15:31.340
I'd rather spend it with you.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.427
Okay.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.435
(Jeanine): Denise and Paul?

15:39.647 --> 15:41.854
lt's terrible!

15:41.983 --> 15:44.770
- Jeanine, um, Robert...

15:46.446 --> 15:48.937
have you ever heard of the Troubles?

15:50.241 --> 15:52.948
- Troub... Well, that's nonsense.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.739
- My parents told me
those were just stories to scare kids.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.744
(chuckles)

15:57.915 --> 16:00.827
- Did either of you stay in touch
with Paul and Denise after school?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.325
- No.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.795
- You know anyone from our class
who had a problem with them back then?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.497
- Well, they weren't exactly saints.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.673
- Yeah, a lot of kids spent
their lunch hour stuffed in lockers,

16:12.847 --> 16:15.088
courtesy of Paul.
And Denise, well...

16:16.058 --> 16:19.346
she was obviously playing out
some very deeply held insecurities, so...

16:19.479 --> 16:22.016
- But it was all so long ago.

16:22.148 --> 16:26.312
- Well, you can't have a better tomorrow

16:26.486 --> 16:28.772
thinking only about yesterday.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.319
- We have to cancel the dance.
- No, uh...

16:34.952 --> 16:39.036
Paul and Denise would've wanted
the reunion to go on.

16:39.165 --> 16:42.999
Like you said,
we can't just think about yesterday, huh?

16:44.837 --> 16:47.078
- Okay.

16:47.924 --> 16:48.879
- Okay.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.790
- We're taking a big chance here.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.879
- If the killer's going after
old classmates,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.422
where better than the dance?

16:54.555 --> 16:56.637
With all those potential victims
in one place.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.204
(snake hisses)
(metal clangs)

17:26.379 --> 17:27.994
- What the hell?
(grunts)

17:43.813 --> 17:47.431
- The whole class is here,
but I still don't see anything suspicious.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.152
(sighs)
(distant phone rings)

17:53.322 --> 17:54.983
Aw...

17:56.325 --> 17:59.283
(Audrey chuckles)
You, president of the AV Club?

17:59.412 --> 18:02.028
- l was a... a geek.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.120
- The best ones are.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.371
- Look at me!
Will you look at me?

18:07.503 --> 18:10.290
- Okay, just calm down, kid.
It's okay. What... what happened?

18:11.465 --> 18:13.376
- Duke?
- Yeah.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.298
- Duke?

18:15.469 --> 18:18.211
- It's me.
I mean, on the inside, it's me.

18:18.347 --> 18:22.090
- Wha... what happened?
- I went to check something at the dock,

18:22.268 --> 18:23.804
and then someone slammed me
in the back of the head.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.640
Next thing I know, I woke up
in the water looking like this.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.930
- Did you see who hit you?
- No.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.271
But they left a calling card:
a snake in a locker.

18:32.403 --> 18:36.021
- Didn't you steal a snake from Biology class
and stick it in someone's locker?

18:36.198 --> 18:37.608
- Man, that was never proved.
- That's not the point.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.990
This could help us with a suspect.
Whose locker was it?

18:40.161 --> 18:43.278
- Look, I never knew!
Was just the only one without a lock on it.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.824
Look, what kind of Trouble is this?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.619
- Whoever did this transformed Paul
and Denise too.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.041
- Denise, huh?

18:50.379 --> 18:52.461
Yeah, she was really hot back then.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.127
- Transformed them back into teenagers
and then murdered them.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.875
So far, you're our only survivor.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.424
- It's gotta be somebody
reliving those days.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.763
Trying to make sure
that other people relive them too.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.348
- Okay, then, I'm laying my odds on Jeanine.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.931
I saw her, and that chick
definitely peaked in high school.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.187
(background chatter)

19:10.358 --> 19:12.690
- Hey, Dwight.
Thanks for meeting me.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.103
- I talked to the Guard.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.397
Apparently Arla came to them
27 years ago,

19:16.572 --> 19:18.108
the day the barn disappeared.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.944
She wanted their help and was furious
when they sent her away.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.279
- What did she want them to do?
- To bring the barn back.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.820
- Did she say why?
- No.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.789
But once it goes...
- It's gone for 27 years.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.703
Nathan told me that you don't exactly have
the best relationship with the Guard.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.340
- Not anymore.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.462
- What happened?
- Ah...

19:40.513 --> 19:44.802
When my Trouble manifested,
the Guard brought me here.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.260
They helped me.

19:47.269 --> 19:51.057
I thought I owed them,
and they took advantage of that.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.351
- Did you relocate Troubled people?

19:53.484 --> 19:56.851
- Until I found out the Guard relocates
some people whether they like it or not.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.318
Tried to get out
and I lost my daughter.

20:01.492 --> 20:04.859
- The Guard killed your daughter?
- Might as well have.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.450
Audrey...

20:13.713 --> 20:16.830
when the barn comes,
you gonna go inside?

20:17.007 --> 20:18.417
- I don't want to.

20:20.594 --> 20:24.257
But I've seen the Troubles
destroy so many people's lives

20:24.390 --> 20:27.507
that if me going in stops it
for 27 years...

20:30.229 --> 20:32.641
- That's a horrible choice
to have to make.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.305
- Yeah.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.069
- Jeanine...

20:48.247 --> 20:50.829
l was there when Denise made fun of you.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.121
Paul rejected you at dinner.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.662
Duke said you came to the Gull.
All three of them

20:57.840 --> 21:00.798
were transformed back into teenagers
while you were angry with them.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.463
- It wasn't me. I swear.

21:03.637 --> 21:07.129
I never could've done that.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.598
- Jeanine, the Troubles aren't just stories.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.305
- I know they're not.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.561
| just said that
so you wouldn't know.

21:16.817 --> 21:17.977
- You're Troubled.

21:18.152 --> 21:20.859
- But I can't do
what you're talking about.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.821
I almost wish I could.
Maybe it would be better.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.862
- What's your Trouble?
- Cake.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.527
- Excuse me?
- It started right after college,

21:29.705 --> 21:31.741
and all my friends
started getting married,

21:31.916 --> 21:35.784
and I wanted to be happy for them,
but I was just jealous.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.045
Then at my best friend's wedding,

21:40.216 --> 21:42.832
she was standing there
and so happy,

21:43.010 --> 21:46.047
and cutting big slices
out of her big beautiful,

21:46.222 --> 21:47.632
fairytale wedding cake and...

21:49.683 --> 21:52.265
| just wanted so badly
for that to be my cake.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.895
- What happened?
- My Trouble kicked in.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.729
And ever since that day,

22:00.903 --> 22:03.110
any food I touch turns into cake.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.609
Doesn't matter what it is:

22:05.783 --> 22:08.695
steak, cheese, celery.

22:08.869 --> 22:13.329
By the time it reaches my mouth,
it is delicious... cake.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.289
Why do you think I look like this now?

22:19.421 --> 22:22.208
Three years, nothing but cake.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.296
You believe me, right?

22:26.428 --> 22:28.760
-ldo.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.301
(chuckles)
Yeah.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.424
It's okay.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.887
- Okay.
- Thank you.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.308
(running footsteps)

22:42.486 --> 22:43.726
- Dude!
- What?

22:43.863 --> 22:46.900
- What'd she say?
- l... It's not Jeanine, okay?

22:47.074 --> 22:49.065
A person can only have
one Trouble and hers is...

22:49.243 --> 22:51.484
it's crazy enough,
it has to be true.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.618
(sighs)

22:54.665 --> 22:57.202
Parker's still interviewing people.
Maybe she'll have better luck.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.992
- No, no, no.
I'm gonna be like this forever.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.376
Audrey's gonna disappear
any second now

23:01.547 --> 23:03.287
and you're never gonna solve this
without her.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.126
- Who gets a do-over?

23:05.259 --> 23:08.751
You've got your whole life
laid out in front of you again.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.719
Kind of wish
it had happened to me.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.429
- You're nuts.

23:13.350 --> 23:17.969
Although in 27 years,
you'd still be young-ish.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.061
- I'd get another chance with her.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.558
Ah...

23:34.330 --> 23:36.412
(gun clicks)

23:38.000 --> 23:40.412
- Payback's a bitch, huh?

23:40.544 --> 23:43.001
- I'm not telling you anything.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.667
- Yeah, that's what we said

23:45.799 --> 23:47.755
when you had us tied up
and helpless.

23:47.885 --> 23:49.671
- Why'd you even bring me here?

23:50.471 --> 23:52.257
I would have thought
you'd be so excited

23:52.389 --> 23:55.597
to present me
to your precious Audrey.

23:55.726 --> 23:58.217
"Look what we did.
Can we be friends?"

23:58.354 --> 24:00.140
- Plenty of time for that.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.103
- You gonna slap me around
a little bit?

24:02.900 --> 24:04.606
Believe me,
I've been through worse.

24:04.735 --> 24:07.101
- We just wanna know
why you're looking for the barn.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.613
- What do you want with Audrey?

24:08.739 --> 24:12.823
- You told Tommy that Audrey
was the only one who could find the barn.

24:14.244 --> 24:18.112
Well, when she does,
I'll be standing right beside her.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.330
- It won't do you any good.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.950
You can't stop the Troubles.
Only Audrey can.

24:23.087 --> 24:25.578
- You and I both know
there's another way.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.459
- Another way?

24:35.432 --> 24:39.766
- You tell me about this other way,
and I'll let you go.

24:44.942 --> 24:47.809
(dance music)

24:51.115 --> 24:54.653
- These people look so... very old.

24:54.785 --> 24:55.774
- Shut up.

24:57.287 --> 25:00.324
- Duke?
- Uh, Junior.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.833
- Oh, should've known.

25:01.959 --> 25:04.575
God help us if he turns out
like his father.

25:13.429 --> 25:17.172
Come on, let's go talk to this DJ
about this lame music he's playing.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.218
- You know, I'm not really
into older women.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.900
-ldunno,
it seems pretty quiet.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.644
I hope we didn't misplay this.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.066
- The killer's here somewhere.

25:35.117 --> 25:37.278
(slow dance music)

25:39.830 --> 25:42.321
I remember this song.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.127
- Dance with me.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.164
- Yeah, I'm... not much of a dancer.

25:48.338 --> 25:51.922
It's... tough when you can't feel your feet.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.920
- Why do I always go
for the shy ones?

25:58.098 --> 26:01.090
(slow dance music)

26:01.268 --> 26:05.307
And I know I just need one more chance

26:05.481 --> 26:09.065
To prove my love to you

26:09.234 --> 26:11.566
If you come back to me

26:11.737 --> 26:13.523
l’l/ guarantee

26:13.697 --> 26:17.030
That [7/ never let you go

26:17.201 --> 26:20.785
Can we go back to the days

26:20.954 --> 26:23.946
Our love was strong

26:25.501 --> 26:27.287
Can you tell me

26:27.461 --> 26:31.955
How a perfect love goes wrong

26:33.634 --> 26:37.798
Can somebody tell me
how to get things back

26:37.971 --> 26:41.555
The way they used to be

26:42.643 --> 26:45.009
Oh God give me the reason...

26:45.187 --> 26:48.304
So what were you like
in high school?

26:49.691 --> 26:52.979
- l was, uh...
(background chatter, music)

26:53.153 --> 26:55.394
...kind of an outsider.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.192
- Yeah?

26:57.324 --> 27:00.612
And I thought
all your classmates liked you.

27:00.744 --> 27:03.531
Robert and Jeanine...
You guys weren't all friends?

27:05.415 --> 27:08.157
- Jeanine wouldn't even have given me
the time of day.

27:09.962 --> 27:14.171
Robbie... Standing next to the guy
was an invitation to be bullied.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.336
- Well, he acts like none of it
even affected him.

27:19.847 --> 27:21.758
- It did back then.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.013
- If... Jeanine was the one

27:27.187 --> 27:29.519
who would most want to come back
to high school,

27:29.690 --> 27:31.726
if the Trouble was about revenge...

27:33.443 --> 27:36.401
- The killer was bullied.
- Yeah.

27:37.447 --> 27:41.816
And his Trouble turns his bullies
back into the teenagers that hurt him.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.494
- And he hurts them back.
- Yeah.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.331
- Grab Duke.
We gotta find Robbie.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.630
- We gotta go.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.962
Could somebody tell me

28:00.137 --> 28:05.222
How to get things back
the way they used to be...

28:05.392 --> 28:08.225
(laughter)
- Oh! Okay.

28:08.395 --> 28:12.104
Who wants to fire one up?
I got a prescription.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.644
- Looks like we're going
to the boiler room.

28:14.776 --> 28:15.731
- Oh.
(laughter)

28:15.903 --> 28:17.359
Okay, that always gives me
the munchies,

28:17.487 --> 28:21.196
but, uh, what's a couple
extra hours in the gym?

28:21.325 --> 28:24.283
- The gym!
Now I remember you.

28:24.411 --> 28:27.949
You're that guy
that Paul razzed that time.

28:28.123 --> 28:31.581
- Paul told you Denise wanted to meet you
under the gym bleachers at lunch.

28:31.710 --> 28:35.623
Custodian found you
still there the next morning.

28:35.756 --> 28:37.667
- Yeah, I missed three classes,

28:37.841 --> 28:40.378
and my parents thought
I'd been kidnapped.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.544
(woman): Oh!
- And I got detention for a month.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.172
- Can't believe you waited there all night!
I mean, thinking Denise would show?

28:47.351 --> 28:48.431
- I got locked in.

28:48.602 --> 28:50.308
- I can't believe you thought
she actually liked you.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.720
- I said I got locked in.
(chuckling)

28:57.444 --> 29:00.186
(woman): What a loser he was.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.647
- You're not that kid anymore.

29:06.703 --> 29:08.659
You're not Robbie.

29:21.343 --> 29:22.924
- | forgot how gross it is in here.

29:23.053 --> 29:25.635
- Mm, that's because we were too busy
making out

29:25.806 --> 29:27.262
for you to notice.
- Mm-hmm.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.810
(door slams shut)

29:44.866 --> 29:47.994
- Somebody locked us in here.
- Oh, we are so busted!

29:48.120 --> 29:49.951
Our parents are gonna be pissed.

29:52.749 --> 29:53.864
(rumbling)

29:54.042 --> 29:55.828
- Is something wrong
with the boiler?

29:56.003 --> 29:57.618
(rattling)

30:00.090 --> 30:01.250
- Chaz?

30:02.718 --> 30:03.924
(steam hissing)
(screams)

30:07.806 --> 30:08.966
- Hey!

30:09.808 --> 30:11.389
Stop! Police!

30:11.518 --> 30:14.009
(Duke): lt's Robbie.
That kid is toast.

30:17.566 --> 30:20.649
- Hey!
- Sounds like the boiler's gonna blow.

30:20.777 --> 30:21.812
Get back.

30:21.945 --> 30:24.186
- Police!
Everybody out, now!

30:25.365 --> 30:27.151
(overlapping chatter, screams)

30:27.284 --> 30:30.242
- Robbie? Is that you?

30:30.412 --> 30:32.152
- Robbie,
I know that they hurt you,

30:32.331 --> 30:34.492
but that doesn't mean
they deserve to die.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.827
- You have no idea
what it was like!

30:38.378 --> 30:41.290
I bet you were pretty,
like them.

30:44.051 --> 30:45.791
- I guess we'll never know.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.384
Robert, listen,
I want to help you.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.175
- I'm not Robert!
l'm Robbie.

30:52.601 --> 30:54.432
(gunshot)
Ah...

31:12.287 --> 31:14.994
- Hang on, Robbie.
The paramedics are on their way.

31:16.666 --> 31:19.749
- We searched the building.
No sign of Arla.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.387
(scoffs)

31:32.015 --> 31:35.257
- Uh, what happened?

31:35.394 --> 31:38.010
Oh, my God. What happened?
I was...

31:39.481 --> 31:41.893
l was in the hallway
with Becka and Chaz.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.395
- You don't remember being Robbie?

31:48.698 --> 31:52.862
- Coming back, seeing everyone
must've stirred up a lot of bad memories.

31:53.829 --> 31:55.945
And your Trouble...

31:56.081 --> 31:57.617
transformed you back
into your teenage self

31:57.791 --> 31:59.577
so you could hurt
the people who hurt you.

31:59.709 --> 32:01.370
- Paul, Denise, Duke.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.831
- I didn't even know it was Robbie's locker
I put the snake in.

32:05.132 --> 32:06.372
Thought it was yours.

32:08.135 --> 32:10.547
- But how could I do all this
without knowing?

32:10.679 --> 32:14.046
- I think that your Trouble just made you
into a completely different person.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.434
- I didn't know I had Troubles.

32:17.894 --> 32:19.054
Now...

32:21.314 --> 32:23.521
now people are dead
and it's all my fault.

32:23.650 --> 32:24.935
- No.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.564
We were all so mean back then.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.234
I didn't realize
until I was on the other side.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.941
- YOU were never mean 110 me.

32:35.162 --> 32:38.450
But I figured
you didn't know I existed.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.502
- You wore a backpack
with a Green Day patch.

32:46.173 --> 32:49.040
Always had a Crystal Pepsi
with your lunch.

32:49.176 --> 32:50.962
I thought you were cool.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.927
I really wish I'd told you.

32:55.056 --> 32:57.092
- You're telling me now.

32:57.225 --> 33:01.343
- Yeah... like it matters anymore.

33:02.355 --> 33:05.847
- | always thought that you were
the prettiest girl in our class.

33:07.903 --> 33:10.144
I still do.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.445
(chuckles)

33:20.248 --> 33:21.624
-Ah...

33:26.004 --> 33:27.210
Thank God.

33:31.051 --> 33:34.464
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, all clear upstairs.

33:35.222 --> 33:36.632
- Down here too.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.677
(background chatter)
(sighs)

33:39.851 --> 33:42.593
- Dwight's taking Jeanine and Robert
someplace safe.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.186
- Being together and finally
being able to accept each other

33:45.315 --> 33:47.806
for who they really are,

33:47.943 --> 33:50.525
I think that should help Robbie
from appearing again.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.645
- Well, here's to that.

33:52.781 --> 33:55.773
And to... being able
to legally drink again.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.032
- You were cute as a teenager.

34:01.164 --> 34:04.247
- Yes, lwas.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.456
(sighs)

34:13.593 --> 34:16.005
- Meteor storm starts soon.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.670
For a second there, I didn't know
if I was gonna live to see it.

34:18.807 --> 34:21.219
- Arla saved you from Robbie.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.844
She didn't kill you
when you discovered she was Claire.

34:25.981 --> 34:28.472
- Well, the barn will be here
in a few hours.

34:29.776 --> 34:32.688
Then maybe we can figure out
what Arla really wants.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.115
I'm gonna go up
(sighs) I

34:45.917 --> 34:47.498
What are you doing?

34:47.669 --> 34:50.376
- What I want to do
is stay here with you.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.215
I'm gonna fix this.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.175
I'm not gonna let this
be our last night.

35:04.978 --> 35:07.060
I'm not giving up.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.645
When that barn appears,
we need to be there.

35:12.819 --> 35:16.653
So we'll go back to the station,
and we'll put together search parties.

35:16.781 --> 35:20.524
Contact the Coast Guard, maybe they'll
let us use their satellite surveillance.

35:20.702 --> 35:25.071
- Just so happens I know a guy.
- Ah... figured you might.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.826
- It's good to know that my guys
have my back.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.498
- Hey. You need rest, but...

35:32.631 --> 35:35.088
we're gonna find that barn
before it finds you.

35:45.727 --> 35:48.434
- Good night.
- 'Night.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.901
- Uh, I'm gonna have Manny stay here
and watch the apartment.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.950
- You trust him?
- Yeah, he's okay.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.121
(door opens)

36:15.507 --> 36:17.748
- I'm gonna assume because
they didn't card you at the door

36:17.884 --> 36:19.670
that everything went okay
with Robert and Jeanine?

36:19.844 --> 36:22.631
- Not here about that.
I'm here about Audrey.

36:22.764 --> 36:24.971
- Audrey, why?
- When I met with Kirk earlier,

36:25.141 --> 36:27.348
he told me the Guard wants Audrey
in the barn tomorrow;

36:27.519 --> 36:29.180
to make sure that happens.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.015
- I know what the Guard wants.

36:32.524 --> 36:35.732
Audrey is going in that barn
over my dead body.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.735
- I told them as much.
Be careful, Nathan.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.778
(door opens, closes)

36:48.206 --> 36:49.537
- What did he want?

36:51.376 --> 36:53.207
- I'm not sure.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.708
(gun clicks)

36:57.841 --> 37:02.175
- Call for help...
and people start dying.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.447
- Should ljust get
another set of keys made?

37:23.783 --> 37:25.319
- Don't worry.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.864
This is probably my last visit.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.537
- Wow. It's really you.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.367
James' wife.

37:35.503 --> 37:40.338
- In the flesh.
Well... as close as I could get.

37:40.508 --> 37:44.046
- Was it really worth killing
all those women to make that face?

37:49.893 --> 37:51.724
- When James comes out
of that barn,

37:53.021 --> 37:56.479
I wanna look like the woman he loved.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.815
That he still loves.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.489
- Why do you think James
was in the barn?

38:03.615 --> 38:05.651
- Because that's where Lucy brought him.

38:11.581 --> 38:12.787
(sighs)

38:12.916 --> 38:14.747
After James was murdered,

38:16.628 --> 38:19.836
Lucy said she'd bring both of us
into the barn with her.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.371
She said once we were in there,

38:21.549 --> 38:23.756
the restorative properties
that kept her alive,

38:23.927 --> 38:27.090
that kept you alive...

38:28.556 --> 38:31.218
would bring James back.

38:38.608 --> 38:41.475
- You were in the barn
27 years ago?

38:41.611 --> 38:44.603
- Before the barn arrived,

38:44.781 --> 38:46.646
my Trouble kicked in.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.783
l was in my hotel,

38:50.912 --> 38:52.868
and my skin...

38:54.666 --> 38:56.782
it just started to slide off,

38:56.918 --> 38:58.783
strip by strip,

38:58.920 --> 39:02.037
until there was nothing left.

39:02.966 --> 39:07.676
l was just a raw, oozing thing.

39:08.388 --> 39:12.973
- So you killed an innocent young woman
so you could steal her skin to wear.

39:13.810 --> 39:16.643
- It was just instinct.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.473
Besides, I didn't have a choice.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.820
I couldn't let James see me like that.

39:29.576 --> 39:31.316
Lucy didn't understand.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.203
So she tricked me.

39:37.166 --> 39:39.873
She brought James to the barn alone.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.373
And by the time I got there,
I couldn't get in.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.793
l banged on the door.
lpounded,lbegged!

39:54.976 --> 39:56.762
The barn just disappeared.

39:58.271 --> 40:00.683
- So Lucy left you behind.

40:04.694 --> 40:06.104
- None of that matters.

40:07.488 --> 40:09.228
Because the storm is almost here.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.402
It's time for you
to return James to me.

40:17.790 --> 40:20.076
- I'm not gonna help you
find that barn.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.617
- Then help yourself.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.625
You don't wanna go away again, right?

40:29.761 --> 40:32.002
You want to stay here in Haven
with Nathan.

40:32.138 --> 40:35.175
- You can't make that happen.
- But James can.

40:37.226 --> 40:39.012
Before he died,
he said that he and Lucy

40:39.187 --> 40:42.896
found a way to save her from the barn
and still end the Troubles.

40:43.024 --> 40:46.107
And not just for the next 27 years.

40:46.235 --> 40:49.068
End them for good.

40:49.197 --> 40:51.279
- No, you're lying.

40:55.370 --> 40:57.031
- Think about it, Audrey.

40:59.082 --> 41:01.198
Nathan will be able to feel again.

41:01.334 --> 41:04.622
And Duke could be set free
from his legacy.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.331
You take me to James

41:09.509 --> 41:12.171
and you won't ever have to worry
about going away again.

41:15.139 --> 41:17.801
- What makes you think,
after everything you've done,

41:17.934 --> 41:20.050
that I'm gonna
let you near my son?

41:21.187 --> 41:22.768
- Because if you don't,

41:24.899 --> 41:27.982
you and everyone you love...

41:29.862 --> 41:31.443
will die.

41:46.295 --> 41:48.160
(rumbling)

41:56.681 --> 41:58.672
- Where do you want to go, James?

42:34.802 --> 42:36.758
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
