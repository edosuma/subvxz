I'm from Realm Insurance,
about the pizza van accident.

22:54.920 --> 22:55.920
[woman]<i> </i>I mean,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.720
it'll cover you for up to four months,
but that is quite a substantial claim.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.520
Well, I was heading off on tour
with the Philharmonic next week.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.880
Europe, Middle East, Australia.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.520
-Not now.
-Mm.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.280
As I'm sure you appreciate,
with a payout of this size,

23:09.360 --> 23:12.640
-we will need to investigate the accident.
-Yeah, of course.

23:12.720 --> 23:16.680
Now, that stretch of the street has
a security camera, vandalized,

23:16.760 --> 23:19.600
by some kids, I'm guessing,
paintballed right in the wrong place.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.080
But the, um...

23:22.200 --> 23:25.280
delivery van thing must've had a camera.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.360
-Not working.
-Oh, for God's sake.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.640
No, that's actually good for your claim.
Fences Pizza's a big company.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.280
They've been claiming
their driverless fleet has a good record.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.200
[man scoffs]

23:34.280 --> 23:37.240
The malfunctioning camera,
that's a step toward negligence.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.640
So if we can prove full liability,
you could also consider filing

23:40.720 --> 23:43.080
a substantial civil case
under our litigation wing?

23:43.680 --> 23:45.000
Could be a lot of money.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.280
Yeah, OK, I'm sold.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.520
Great. [chuckles]

your memories of what happened.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.560
Now, they're subjective.

24:28.640 --> 24:32.240
They may not be totally accurate,
and they're often emotional,

24:32.320 --> 24:36.760
but by collecting a range of recollections
from yourself and any witnesses,

24:36.840 --> 24:39.160
we can help build a corroborative picture
of the whole.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.400
[man] I don't remember anything.
It's a total blank.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.520

and then what happened?
