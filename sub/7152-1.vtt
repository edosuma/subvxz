WEBVTT

02:12.634 --> 02:16.805
I, Edwin Dennis,
being of sound mind and body,

02:17.013 --> 02:19.265
do hereby bequeath
to my only son, Patrick,

02:19.474 --> 02:21.518
all my worldly possessions.

02:21.726 --> 02:22.936
In the event of my demise,

02:23.144 --> 02:25.480
I direct my faithful servant,
Norah Muldoon,

02:25.688 --> 02:28.441
to deliver Patrick
to my sister and next of kin,

02:28.858 --> 02:31.945
Mame Dennis, at 3 Beekman Place,
New York City.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.405
The expenses of his upbringing
shall be supervised

02:34.614 --> 02:36.199
by Mr. Dwight Babcock,

02:36.407 --> 02:38.701
acting for the Knickerbocker
bank as trustee,

02:38.910 --> 02:41.246
with the full power to keep
that crazy sister of mine

02:41.454 --> 02:43.289
from doing anything
too damned eccentric

02:43.498 --> 02:46.000
and bringing him up
to be anything like her.

02:46.626 --> 02:49.712
Since I keep myself
in splendid physical condition

02:49.921 --> 02:52.465
through workouts daily
at the Chicago brokers club,

02:52.674 --> 02:54.134
I am confident
that these provisions

02:54.342 --> 02:57.011
will not go into force or effect
for many years.

02:57.220 --> 03:00.431
I hereby affix my hand
this 14th day of September,

03:00.682 --> 03:02.851
in the year 1928.

03:15.155 --> 03:17.240
You've been reading this
for a week, Norah.

03:17.448 --> 03:18.741
Why did you bring it
to New York?

03:18.950 --> 03:21.202
It's the only way I can
make meself believe it.

03:21.411 --> 03:22.704
Besides, I thought
your Auntie Mame

03:22.912 --> 03:23.955
would like it
as a remembrance

03:24.164 --> 03:25.790
of your poor
sainted father.

03:26.749 --> 03:27.750
Don't you be going
by way

03:27.959 --> 03:29.377
of the north pole,
driver!

03:29.586 --> 03:31.337
We're not greenhorns,
you know.

03:48.313 --> 03:49.981
That's 95 cents.

03:50.940 --> 03:53.026
Here's a dollar.
Keep the change.

04:13.671 --> 04:14.714
Like the ladies'
rest room

04:14.923 --> 04:16.798
in the oriental
theater.

04:20.011 --> 04:21.178
Oh, child!

04:23.056 --> 04:25.975
You're not scared,
are you, Norah?

04:26.184 --> 04:27.310
Of course not.

04:27.518 --> 04:28.811
And don't you be,
child.

04:29.020 --> 04:31.105
Norah's here
to look after you.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.489
Saints alive!

04:40.573 --> 04:41.407
You want?

04:41.616 --> 04:43.284
Is this...Could this be

04:43.493 --> 04:45.370
the residence
of Miss Mame Dennis?

04:45.578 --> 04:46.871
Mame Dennis?
Oh, yes.

04:48.164 --> 04:48.998
I'm Norah Muldoon,

04:49.207 --> 04:51.209
and I'm bringing
young Mr. Dennis to his aunt.

04:51.417 --> 04:54.254
Oh, you come in.
You wait. I fetch.

04:55.088 --> 04:57.257
Madam having
affair now.

05:07.892 --> 05:09.227
Oh!

05:17.860 --> 05:19.404
Isn't he wonderful?

05:34.252 --> 05:36.004
Help is on the way,
darlings!

05:36.254 --> 05:37.422
<i>Henri! Ca va?</i>

05:37.630 --> 05:40.008
Mame!
Mame!

05:41.050 --> 05:42.260
That adorable
little bootlegger

05:42.468 --> 05:44.470
is on his way over here
with another gallon of gin.

05:44.679 --> 05:46.723
Oh, Allen, darling,
I'm so glad--

05:46.931 --> 05:48.766
Edna, I called you
yesterday.

05:48.975 --> 05:49.851
Hello, Mame.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.436
I'll be with you
in a minute.

05:51.853 --> 05:55.523
Vladimir! What on earth
are you doing here?

05:55.732 --> 05:58.192
Drinking myself
to death, of course.

05:58.985 --> 06:01.154
Besides, I am
your guest of honor.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.364
Of course. It couldn't
happen to a nicer fellow.

06:03.573 --> 06:05.658
You must hear his new symphony,
<i>The Pastoral.</i>

06:05.867 --> 06:08.536
It has real airplane motors
and live sheep on the stage.

06:08.745 --> 06:10.121
It's devastating,
simply devastating.

06:10.330 --> 06:13.416
You've met our guest of honor,
Vladimir Klinkoff, Mrs. uh...

06:13.624 --> 06:15.168
Mrs. Klinkoff.

06:16.627 --> 06:17.962
Yes, of course.
Then you've met.

06:18.296 --> 06:21.132
Oh, Perry! Doris!

06:21.341 --> 06:22.759
Now, where are you
off to?

06:22.967 --> 06:24.177
Everyone's
going to Clifton's.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.511
It's nearly 7:00.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.473
I'll be there in a minute!
Tell them to wait for me.

06:29.182 --> 06:31.100
Oh, dear.
The employment bureau

06:31.309 --> 06:33.061
didn't tell me
you were bringing a child.

06:33.269 --> 06:34.937
No matter. He looks like
a nice little boy.

06:35.146 --> 06:37.607
If he misbehaves, we can always
toss him in the river.

06:38.399 --> 06:39.567
I'll give you my
life savings, mum,

06:39.776 --> 06:40.568
if you let us escape

06:40.777 --> 06:41.778
from this den
of criminals.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.237
Dr. Feuchtwanger,
just in time.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.365
You better get this woman
on your couch.

06:45.615 --> 06:47.909
I'm not that kind
of woman, mum.

06:48.117 --> 06:50.328
I'm looking for
a Miss Mame Dennis.

06:50.578 --> 06:51.371
Ito, Ito!

06:51.579 --> 06:52.372
Yes, missy?

06:52.580 --> 06:53.956
Oh, Ito, show this woman
to the kitchen

06:54.165 --> 06:55.416
and get her started
on the glasses.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.710
Oh, Missy Dennis,
this not dishwashing lady.

06:57.919 --> 06:59.879
Oh, then I must have
invited you.

07:00.088 --> 07:01.464
Won't you have a drink?

07:01.672 --> 07:03.174
I'm Norah Muldoon.

07:03.383 --> 07:04.801
Didn't you get my
telegram from Chicago

07:05.009 --> 07:06.719
saying we'd arrive
at 6:00 today?

07:06.928 --> 07:10.348
No, that's not possible.
Your telegram said October 1st.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.433
That's tomorrow.
This is September 31st.

07:12.642 --> 07:15.395
No. 'Tis the 1st.
Curse the evil day.

07:15.645 --> 07:17.271
Everybody knows
30 days hath September,

07:17.480 --> 07:18.314
April, June, and--"

07:18.523 --> 07:20.024
oh!

07:20.233 --> 07:21.734
But, darling!

07:21.943 --> 07:24.946
I'm your Auntie Mame!

07:25.905 --> 07:28.282
Oh, quiet!
Quiet, everybody!

07:28.491 --> 07:31.077
I have an important
announcement to make!

07:31.828 --> 07:37.417
This is my little boy!

07:37.625 --> 07:39.419
Oh, no, no, he's not really
<i>my</i> little boy.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.629
He's my late brother's son
from Chicago,

07:41.838 --> 07:43.131
my only living relative.

07:43.339 --> 07:45.508
That's all we have,
just each other.

07:45.716 --> 07:47.135
My little love!

07:47.343 --> 07:50.263
Well, what's--what am I
going to call you, dear?

07:50.471 --> 07:51.597
Pat.
Patrick Dennis.

07:51.806 --> 07:53.558
Oh, I know
the Dennis part, darling.

07:53.766 --> 07:56.561
From now on,
you must call me Auntie Mame!

07:56.811 --> 08:00.565
Well, well, well, well, now,
would you like a mar--

08:00.773 --> 08:02.608
no. Is it your bedtime,
dear? No, it can't be.

08:02.817 --> 08:03.734
No, the powder room.

08:03.985 --> 08:05.027
You'd like to use
the powder room.

08:05.236 --> 08:07.572
No, no, food! That's it!
You must be famished.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.532
You come right along
with me.

08:13.786 --> 08:15.413
Oh, take your shoes
off, darling.

08:15.621 --> 08:17.748
It's like removing
your hat in America.

08:26.716 --> 08:28.968
Before the sukiyaki,
a little hors d'oeuvre.

08:29.552 --> 08:30.845
Could I try some
of that jam?

08:31.053 --> 08:31.762
Jam?

08:31.971 --> 08:33.181
That BlackBerry jam.

08:33.389 --> 08:34.640
Of course, darling.

08:34.849 --> 08:36.726
Actually, it's sort of
a fishberry jam.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.436
It's called caviar.

08:39.895 --> 08:42.023
Some pickled octopus,

08:42.231 --> 08:43.691
raw fish tails...

08:44.317 --> 08:45.735
It's salty, kinda,
but I like it.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.361
Good, darling.
You have wonderful taste.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.947
Ha ha ha ha!

08:50.198 --> 08:51.741
Vera! Oh.

08:54.035 --> 08:58.289
Vera,
this is my little boy.

08:58.498 --> 09:00.833
Patrick, I want you
to meet a star,

09:01.042 --> 09:02.335
one of the great ladies
of the theater

09:02.543 --> 09:04.003
and Auntie Mame's
dearest friend,

09:04.212 --> 09:05.296
Vera Charles.

09:05.505 --> 09:06.631
Hello.

09:06.881 --> 09:07.715
How do you do?

09:07.924 --> 09:10.843
She just <i>loves</i>
little boys.

09:11.052 --> 09:12.136
Yeah.

09:12.845 --> 09:13.804
Oh.

09:15.097 --> 09:15.932
Who's he?

09:16.182 --> 09:17.517
That's a Lithuanian
bishop, darling.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.352
Doesn't speak
a word of English.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.979
Stimulating man!
Oh, your grace.

09:23.356 --> 09:24.232
He's such a darling

09:24.440 --> 09:26.234
and so worldly
for a man of god.

09:26.442 --> 09:28.194
And so everything
in the universe

09:28.402 --> 09:30.738
is composed of
the elements of Aristotle.

09:30.947 --> 09:33.032
Thus, man himself is fire,

09:33.241 --> 09:35.576
dust, and air
mingled with water.

09:35.785 --> 09:36.661
Acacius, darling,

09:36.911 --> 09:39.247
this is my little
nephew, Patrick.

09:39.455 --> 09:41.207
This is Mr. page,
dear.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.667
<i>Gnothi Seauton.</i>

09:42.875 --> 09:44.710
That means
"know thyself."

09:44.919 --> 09:46.671
Mr. page is
a great educator.

09:46.921 --> 09:48.130
He runs a school
down in the village

09:48.339 --> 09:50.883
where they do all sorts
of advanced things.

09:51.092 --> 09:53.344
Do you think you might
find room for Patrick?

09:53.594 --> 09:55.346
- For him, yes!
- Ah!

09:55.555 --> 09:58.683
In this boy, I see already
the fire, dust, and air.

09:58.891 --> 10:00.518
Well, we'll just
add water and stir.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.353
Do you think you might
want to go there, darling?

10:02.562 --> 10:04.480
Do they wear uniforms
in your school?

10:04.689 --> 10:06.857
In my school, young man,
we wear nothing.

10:07.066 --> 10:09.735
It's heaven!
It'll stimulate his psyche

10:09.944 --> 10:11.237
and stir up his libido.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.738
What's libido,
Auntie Mame?

10:12.947 --> 10:16.826
Libido is--I'll tell you
what we're going to do.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.912
Every time you hear a word
you don't understand, dear,

10:20.121 --> 10:22.039
take this pad and pencil
and write it down.

10:22.415 --> 10:24.250
Later on, Auntie Mame
will explain it to you.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.459
I'm off, Mame!

10:25.668 --> 10:29.255
Lindsay! Lindsay,
this is Patrick.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.257
Patrick, I want you
to meet Lindsay Woolsey,

10:31.465 --> 10:32.592
the publisher--
nautilus books.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.551
Hello.

10:33.759 --> 10:34.635
Hello, young man.

10:34.844 --> 10:35.761
Circulate, darling,
circulate.

10:35.970 --> 10:37.805
Well, Mame,
new man in your life?

10:38.014 --> 10:39.181
Little Patrick.

10:39.390 --> 10:40.933
Guess I won't be
seeing much of you.

10:41.142 --> 10:42.560
Ah, nonsense, Lindsay.
We'll be going to

10:42.768 --> 10:44.937
the zoo, the aquarium,
the philharmonic.

10:45.146 --> 10:46.272
We'll be together
constantly--

10:46.480 --> 10:47.648
the three of us!

10:47.857 --> 10:50.234
That's exactly what
I had in mind.

10:50.443 --> 10:51.569
Good night,
Mame.

10:51.777 --> 10:52.778
Good night.
Watch it, Phyllis.

10:52.987 --> 10:54.113
Boy, it's been
some party!

10:54.322 --> 10:56.282
Good night. It was
so good of you to come.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.285
You played beautifully.
I can't thank you enough. Ah...

10:59.493 --> 11:00.786
<i>Dasvidaniya.</i>

11:00.995 --> 11:02.788
Good-bye, Mrs. uh...

11:06.042 --> 11:07.251
Of course, of course.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.295
There you are,
my little love.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.589
Well, you come over here
with your Auntie Mame

11:11.797 --> 11:12.965
and sit down for one minute,

11:13.174 --> 11:15.593
and we'll really
get to know each other.

11:19.055 --> 11:22.475
Well, now, read me all the words
you don't understand.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.101
"Libido,

11:24.310 --> 11:25.811
"inferiority
complex,

11:26.354 --> 11:29.315
"Stinko, Blotto,
free love,

11:29.523 --> 11:31.067
"bathtub gin,

11:31.275 --> 11:32.568
"monkey glands,

11:32.777 --> 11:34.028
Karl Marx--"

11:34.278 --> 11:36.322
is he one of
the Marx brothers?

11:36.530 --> 11:37.823
Oh, oh, no, dear.

11:38.032 --> 11:39.617
She last pretty good
tonight, missy.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.744
Marie Antoinette
room again?

11:41.952 --> 11:43.788
Yes. Perhaps she'll wake up
without a head tomorrow.

11:43.996 --> 11:46.957
Oh, and Ito, get that
dog of a dress off her.

11:47.166 --> 11:50.044
Me tuck her in.
Hee hee hee!

11:51.629 --> 11:53.381
Is the English lady
sick, Auntie Mame?

11:53.589 --> 11:55.841
She's not English, darling.
She's from Pittsburgh.

11:56.050 --> 11:57.343
She sounded English.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.470
When you're from Pittsburgh,
you have to do something.

11:59.679 --> 12:00.846
Now, where were we?

12:01.222 --> 12:03.182
"Narcissisistic,

12:03.391 --> 12:05.476
Lysistrata,

12:05.685 --> 12:08.437
"Cubism, squiffed,
neurotic,

12:08.771 --> 12:09.772
heterosexual--"

12:09.980 --> 12:12.066
oh, my, my, my!
What an eager little mind!

12:12.483 --> 12:14.610
You won't need some of these
words for months and months,

12:15.111 --> 12:16.779
but your vocabulary
does needs working on.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.406
Didn't your father
ever talk to you?

12:18.614 --> 12:19.532
Hardly ever.

12:19.740 --> 12:20.950
I only saw him
at breakfast time.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.326
What did he say
then?

12:22.576 --> 12:23.828
He usually said,
"pipe down, kid.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.663
The old man's hung."

12:26.831 --> 12:27.873
That's succinct.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.876
What did you do
in Chicago for fun?

12:31.085 --> 12:33.045
Well, Norah took me
to the movies

12:33.254 --> 12:34.588
every Saturday
afternoon.

12:35.047 --> 12:36.382
I played Parcheesi
with the doorman

12:36.590 --> 12:38.759
once in a while
until he got fired.

12:38.968 --> 12:41.011
Didn't they do anything
cultural for you in chic--

12:41.220 --> 12:42.888
well, never mind.

12:43.139 --> 12:46.100
Your Auntie Mame's going
to open doors for you, Patrick,

12:46.475 --> 12:49.145
doors you never
even dreamed existed!

12:49.395 --> 12:51.397
Oh, what times
we're going to have.

12:51.605 --> 12:54.275
What on earth did I do
with that will?

12:55.109 --> 12:57.361
Now,
it's here someplace.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.239
Ah! Here we are!

13:00.448 --> 13:02.950
Well, now, "get mahjong lesson,
hair done, fitting."

13:03.159 --> 13:05.536
That can't be it.
Yes, it is it.

13:05.745 --> 13:06.495
Oh, dear. This is

13:06.704 --> 13:07.872
a legal-looking
document.

13:08.789 --> 13:09.915
There's a lot of
folderol here about

13:10.124 --> 13:11.709
the Knickerbocker bank
and some Mr. Babcock

13:11.917 --> 13:13.878
who's been appointed
your trustee.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.422
Oh, I see
what that means.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.215
I have
the responsibility,

13:18.424 --> 13:20.676
and your trustee
has the authority.

13:20.885 --> 13:23.262
Norah took me to a movie once
about a trustee.

13:23.471 --> 13:25.222
There was a big prison break,

13:25.473 --> 13:27.475
and the trustee saved
the warden's little daughter.

13:27.725 --> 13:29.477
This isn't
the kind of trustee

13:29.685 --> 13:31.395
that lives in prison,
dear...

13:31.687 --> 13:32.897
As a rule.

13:33.105 --> 13:35.566
Mr. Babcock. We'll tackle
him in our own good time.

13:35.775 --> 13:39.653
Now, Patrick, is Auntie Mame
anything like you expected?

13:39.987 --> 13:42.239
No, ma'am. The only
picture I saw of you

13:42.448 --> 13:43.741
was with a shawl

13:43.949 --> 13:46.535
and a Rose in your teeth...
Like a Spanish lady.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.412
It's in my suitcase
that's coming.

13:48.621 --> 13:50.247
Didn't your father
tell you

13:50.498 --> 13:52.208
anything about me
before he died?

13:52.416 --> 13:53.375
Yes, ma'am.

13:53.584 --> 13:55.127
Oh,
and what was it?

13:57.922 --> 14:01.050
Oh, come now,
my little love.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.968
You must always
be perfectly frank

14:03.177 --> 14:05.221
with your
Auntie Mame. Now...

14:05.471 --> 14:07.973
Well, my father said

14:08.182 --> 14:09.975
since you're my
only living relative,

14:10.184 --> 14:12.978
I might be living
with you someday

14:13.187 --> 14:14.480
and...

14:15.397 --> 14:16.565
Well?

14:17.483 --> 14:19.318
But that to be left
in your hands

14:19.527 --> 14:22.112
was a fate he wouldn't
wish on a dog.

14:23.656 --> 14:24.573
That...

14:27.243 --> 14:28.369
What's that,
Auntie Mame?

14:28.911 --> 14:29.995
That is a "B,"
darling,

14:30.204 --> 14:31.664
the first letter
of a 7-letter word

14:31.872 --> 14:33.582
that means
your late father.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.085
Come, child.
I'll show you your room.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.796
It's a cozy little nook,
darling,

14:39.004 --> 14:40.631
and my loom
is by the window.

14:40.840 --> 14:41.966
Do you like
to weave, dear?

14:42.216 --> 14:43.467
You can sit at it
by the hour.

14:43.676 --> 14:44.718
I had instruction

14:44.927 --> 14:46.178
from a descendant
of Pocahontas.

14:46.387 --> 14:48.556
I began with
an <i>enormous</i> rug.

14:48.764 --> 14:51.016
It's that bell pull
by the fireplace.

14:51.267 --> 14:53.352
Your own little den.
Oh!

14:54.103 --> 14:56.188
How stupid of me.

14:56.397 --> 14:58.607
I gave up weaving
for sculpture.

14:58.858 --> 15:00.484
That is, a sculptor
friend of Auntie Mame's

15:00.693 --> 15:02.319
used this room
for about 6 months.

15:02.528 --> 15:04.947
A divine man!
Such talented fingers!

15:05.155 --> 15:06.824
Oh! What they did
to my bust.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.409
That's the head,
you know.

15:10.411 --> 15:12.162
I guess it's not
quite ready yet.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.833
I know--the Marie Antoinette
room. No, no, Vera's there.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.501
Camp out with me
for tonight, dear.

15:19.628 --> 15:22.339
Oh, shall we try
this out for size?

15:23.007 --> 15:24.425
There.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.511
Ah! Perfect!

15:27.761 --> 15:28.512
Well, shall we--

15:28.721 --> 15:29.722
I'll do it.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.891
Oh, sheets.
Where were the sheets?

15:32.099 --> 15:34.184
What time will you be home
from that party?

15:35.436 --> 15:37.813
What makes you think
I'm going to any party?

16:46.590 --> 16:49.259
Just as I was gettin'
used to all them dragons.

16:49.468 --> 16:50.260
What is it?

16:50.469 --> 16:51.679
Don't ask me.
I didn't paint it.

16:51.887 --> 16:54.014
I just hung it up. Can I
get in her bedroom now?

16:54.223 --> 16:56.809
At 2:00? You'll be lucky
to get in there by 5:00.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.143
She's still sleepin'.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.478
Well, I'll get started
in the other bedroom.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.105
Can't go in there
either.

17:01.313 --> 17:03.565
Why not? She ain't sleepin'
in 2 bedrooms, is she?

17:03.774 --> 17:06.819
Oh, no. It's the first lady
of the American theater

17:07.027 --> 17:08.612
out cold
in the guest room.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.948
Again? What does she do,
live here?

17:11.198 --> 17:12.616
Miss Charles
don't live here.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.452
She drinks here and does
her passin' out here.

17:15.703 --> 17:18.454
It's a wonder the blood
hasn't turned to vinegar.

17:18.664 --> 17:19.580
2 weeks, I've been here,

17:19.790 --> 17:21.916
and they've had
13 cocktail parties.

17:22.126 --> 17:23.502
Only 13 in 2 weeks?

17:23.711 --> 17:24.877
They had to call one off.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.631
The bootlegger
couldn't come that day.

17:34.263 --> 17:36.557
Auntie Mame!
Auntie Mame!

17:37.057 --> 17:38.017
Auntie Mame!

17:38.225 --> 17:40.019
Hmm?
Wha--what is it?

17:40.227 --> 17:41.687
What happened?

17:41.895 --> 17:43.647
I've got something
to show you.

17:44.690 --> 17:45.899
Look!

17:46.108 --> 17:47.484
Ah! Bats!

17:47.693 --> 17:48.652
Oh.

17:48.861 --> 17:50.070
I built it myself.

17:50.279 --> 17:51.864
See? It's got
a rubber band motor,

17:52.072 --> 17:53.657
and I whittled the body
out of balsa wood.

17:53.866 --> 17:54.700
Please, darling.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.660
Your Auntie Mame
is hung.

17:58.662 --> 17:59.538
Oh.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.958
Oh, sure,
Auntie Mame.

18:04.084 --> 18:04.835
Sure.

18:05.044 --> 18:07.838
Oh, Patrick,
Patrick, come back.

18:08.505 --> 18:09.548
You know I really
am interested

18:09.757 --> 18:11.467
in all your projects.

18:12.176 --> 18:15.137
Child, how can you see
with all that light?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.851
Ah! That's better. Now be
an angel and run to Ito

18:21.060 --> 18:23.062
and tell him to bring me
a very light breakfast--

18:23.270 --> 18:25.064
black coffee
and a sidecar...

18:25.272 --> 18:27.608
Oh, and a cold towel
for your Auntie Vera.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.485
Is she in the
guest room again?

18:29.693 --> 18:31.987
Since Sunday, dear.
Run along, darling.

18:32.196 --> 18:36.033
Oh! First come and give your
Auntie Mame a good morning kiss.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.869
Ooh, gently, darling,
gently.

18:39.328 --> 18:42.039
Mmm!
That was lovely!

18:42.247 --> 18:44.833
Oh, you know I really am
fascinated by aviation.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.043
I never knew before

18:46.251 --> 18:48.087
they did it all
with rubber bands.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.341
Oh!

18:52.549 --> 18:53.342
Uhh!

18:53.550 --> 18:54.593
Hello?

18:54.802 --> 18:56.428
Miss Dennis?
Yes, she's here.

18:56.637 --> 18:57.930
Who's calling, please?

18:59.431 --> 19:00.557
Hold the wire.

19:00.766 --> 19:02.684
It's Mr. Babcock from
the Knickerbocker bank.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.937
Oh, I've been
dodging him for days.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.939
Well, hello,
Mr. Babcock.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.942
How nice to hear
your voice at last.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.027
I, too,
am looking forward

19:12.236 --> 19:14.321
with anticipation
to meeting you.

19:15.114 --> 19:17.157
Oh, the little lad
is fine, just fine.

19:17.366 --> 19:18.575
He, too, cannot wait
to meet you.

19:18.784 --> 19:20.869
Hurry my tray, darling.
Auntie needs fuel.

19:21.662 --> 19:24.414
Oh, do drop over anytime,
Mr. Babcock.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.584
In how many minutes?!

19:28.544 --> 19:30.671
Well, yes, 57th street

19:30.879 --> 19:34.216
is right in my <i>neck</i>
of the woods.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.970
Spitting distance?

19:39.179 --> 19:40.139
How vivid.

19:40.681 --> 19:41.682
Yes, well,
come right along then.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.559
You can join me
for breakf--tea.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.770
Number 3 Beekman Place,
right away. Vera!

19:46.979 --> 19:48.230
Vera!

19:48.814 --> 19:49.773
Vera.

19:51.817 --> 19:53.485
Vera, Vera.

19:53.694 --> 19:54.820
I am about to
be attacked

19:55.028 --> 19:56.572
by the Knickerbocker
bank.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.448
Oh, that's lovely!

19:58.657 --> 20:00.075
Vera!

20:00.284 --> 20:02.786
Oh! Why did
that oriental sandman

20:03.036 --> 20:04.997
let me sleep
in my best Chanel?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.123
He tried to
get it off you,

20:06.373 --> 20:08.167
but you bit him.
Patrick's trustee,

20:08.375 --> 20:09.918
some hideous man from
the Knickerbocker bank,

20:10.127 --> 20:11.753
is about to descend
upon me like a vulture

20:11.962 --> 20:14.089
and Rob me of my child!

20:14.840 --> 20:18.177
He's coming here...
In the middle of the night?

20:18.802 --> 20:21.471
Oh!
That moon's bright!

20:21.680 --> 20:23.390
Vera, will you stop
being silly?

20:23.599 --> 20:24.308
Don't you realize

20:24.516 --> 20:26.059
I have <i>got</i> to make
the right impression.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.603
You have no idea
how conservative

20:27.811 --> 20:28.937
the Knickerbocker
bank is.

20:29.146 --> 20:29.938
They're so conservative,

20:30.147 --> 20:30.981
they don't pay
any interest at all!

20:31.190 --> 20:35.027
All right! Let's get organized.
What time is it...

20:35.235 --> 20:36.612
And what day is it?

20:36.820 --> 20:38.197
Oh! Blessed mother
of Maud Adams!

20:38.405 --> 20:40.199
I was due at
the theatre guild an hour ago!

20:40.407 --> 20:41.617
You cannot desert me
in my predicament.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.535
Look at my face. What on
earth am I going to wear?

20:44.119 --> 20:46.330
How can I face
the theatre guild?

20:46.538 --> 20:47.915
Will this make me look
like a Scarsdale matron?

20:48.123 --> 20:49.499
Have you ever been
to Scarsdale?

20:49.708 --> 20:50.542
Good afternoon,
aunt Vera.

20:50.751 --> 20:52.002
- Yes, dear.
- No, dear.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.504
Do the Lillian Gish
routine--you know,

20:54.755 --> 20:56.173
simple dress,
Madonna-like hairdo.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.717
Madonna-like hairdo!
Oh, that's it!

20:58.926 --> 21:01.178
That's it!
A switch! A switch!

21:01.428 --> 21:02.512
You've got one?

21:02.721 --> 21:03.805
Dozens!

21:04.014 --> 21:06.099
Mame, don't you ever
throw anything away?

21:06.308 --> 21:08.227
Who knows when I may go
back to one of these colors?

21:08.435 --> 21:10.020
If you kept your hair
natural the way I do--

21:10.229 --> 21:12.564
if I kept my hair natural
the way you do, I'd be bald.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.442
Try this.
You need a dress

21:15.651 --> 21:17.236
like the one I wore as--

21:17.444 --> 21:20.113
hey! That's stunning!

21:20.322 --> 21:21.907
Oh, isn't it? That's
my new Maggie Ruth.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.200
I haven't had it on yet.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.244
I'll be damned if
I'll put $500 on my back

21:25.452 --> 21:27.037
for that awful man!
A suit--that'll do it.

21:27.246 --> 21:29.373
Hold this, so I can braid it
so it likes a halo.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.041
I've got to get
over to the guild!

21:31.250 --> 21:32.751
He can't see you looking
the way you do.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.378
He'll think I run a house
for wanton women!

21:34.670 --> 21:36.922
Relax. If it makes you
feel any better,

21:37.130 --> 21:37.881
I'll wear your mink.

21:38.090 --> 21:39.341
Over my dead body.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.677
This Maggie Ruth
is heaven!

21:41.885 --> 21:43.470
You know,
green suits me.

21:43.679 --> 21:45.430
I think
I'll phone up Maggie.

21:45.639 --> 21:48.517
Oh, Vera, come
put this on my head.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.310
Hurry! It doesn't matter
how it looks.

21:50.519 --> 21:51.478
But I've got to
get out of here!

21:51.687 --> 21:53.146
Don't you dare leave me.
You go back to bed.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.190
You couldn't care less
about my career--

21:56.441 --> 21:58.527
Not already! Norah!
Ito, answer the door!

21:58.735 --> 22:00.279
I've got to get out
before he gets in!

22:02.281 --> 22:03.532
I can't leave you
standing down there

22:03.740 --> 22:05.867
like a Fuller brush man
in the doorway!

22:06.076 --> 22:08.620
Why can't you
be my friend?

22:08.829 --> 22:10.539
Well, I've been
a friend of yours--

22:10.747 --> 22:11.748
darling,
go downstairs.

22:11.957 --> 22:12.916
Make Mr. Babcock
feel at home,

22:13.125 --> 22:14.418
like Auntie Mame
taught you.

22:14.626 --> 22:15.711
What about
the theatre guild?

22:15.919 --> 22:17.045
Vera, get out
of my way.

22:17.254 --> 22:19.631
What am I gonna do with
this damn stinking halo?

22:31.351 --> 22:32.394
You want?

22:33.228 --> 22:34.187
I'm Mr. Babcock.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.606
Miss Dennis
is expecting me.

22:36.815 --> 22:38.233
Oh, you come in.

22:38.442 --> 22:39.568
Thank you.

22:40.277 --> 22:41.570
I take coat?

22:41.778 --> 22:43.280
Thank you.
Thank you.

22:50.537 --> 22:51.330
You sit.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.581
Thank you.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.334
Mr. Babcock?

22:55.542 --> 22:56.209
That's right, Sonny.

22:56.418 --> 22:57.586
We've been
expecting you.

22:57.794 --> 22:58.962
My name is
Patrick Dennis.

22:59.171 --> 23:00.339
Fine, fine.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.590
Please sit down,
Mr. Babcock.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.050
Fine, fine.

23:04.801 --> 23:05.761
Hey.

23:06.094 --> 23:06.803
Oh.

23:08.180 --> 23:11.141
Hee hee hee!

23:14.186 --> 23:15.979
Auntie Mame
will be right down.

23:17.064 --> 23:19.399
She's having a little
trouble with her halo.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.694
She'll be right down.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.159
Heh heh heh.

23:29.409 --> 23:33.080
Well, you look like
a bully little chap.

23:33.997 --> 23:36.249
Yes, sir. A bully
little chap.

23:36.750 --> 23:39.044
You look very bully, too,
Mr. Babcock.

23:39.252 --> 23:40.045
Yes.

23:43.131 --> 23:45.467
Would you care for a Martini,
Mr. Babcock?

23:45.759 --> 23:46.718
Well, uh--

23:48.303 --> 23:49.596
dry or extra dry?

23:49.805 --> 23:51.139
Uh, wha--

23:52.140 --> 23:53.809
sit down, please,
Mr. Babcock.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.977
I'll make them like I do
for Mr. Woolcott.

24:16.498 --> 24:17.707
Stir, never shake.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.084
Bruises the gin.

24:44.860 --> 24:46.611
Would you care
for an olive?

24:47.320 --> 24:49.281
Auntie Mame says olives
take up too much room

24:49.489 --> 24:50.907
in such a little glass.

24:54.411 --> 24:55.287
Ah!

24:55.745 --> 24:57.372
Why, Mr. Babcock.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.292
What an honor it is

25:00.500 --> 25:02.210
to have you
in our little home.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.754
Though I wonder
if it does make

25:04.963 --> 25:06.256
the best
first impression

25:06.465 --> 25:08.008
on a sensitive
young mind

25:08.216 --> 25:10.886
to see you drinking
during business hours.

25:11.595 --> 25:12.262
But--but he--

25:12.471 --> 25:13.346
don't you worry.

25:13.555 --> 25:14.306
I won't breathe a word

25:14.514 --> 25:15.682
to the Knickerbocker
bank.

25:15.891 --> 25:18.351
Just one minute! Where
did this boy learn to mix--

25:18.560 --> 25:21.229
Mr. Babcock,
knowledge is power.

25:22.063 --> 25:24.274
That, Miss Dennis, is
exactly what I'm here for,

25:24.483 --> 25:25.942
to discuss this
youngster's education,

25:26.193 --> 25:27.819
his <i>proper</i>
education!

25:28.028 --> 25:28.945
Nuts.

25:30.655 --> 25:31.281
No, thank you.

25:31.490 --> 25:33.325
Won't you sit down,
Mr. Babcock?

25:33.533 --> 25:34.784
This little fellow

25:35.035 --> 25:36.369
won't have to worry
about his future.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.997
All of his money
is in good, steady bonds.

25:39.206 --> 25:40.957
But I'm sure you'll agree
it's high time...

25:41.208 --> 25:42.125
- Jelly beans?
- Thank you.

25:42.334 --> 25:44.461
That he's enrolled
in an institution of learning.

25:44.669 --> 25:45.670
I'm already
enrolled--

25:45.879 --> 25:47.172
let Mr. Babcock
talk, dear.

25:48.173 --> 25:50.342
I've gone to some pains
to gather information

25:50.550 --> 25:51.968
on a number of

25:52.177 --> 25:54.012
the better boys'
schools in town.

25:54.221 --> 25:56.306
Personally, I prefer
coeducational schools.

25:56.515 --> 25:57.390
What do you mean?

25:57.599 --> 25:58.600
Coeducational means

25:58.808 --> 26:00.393
boys and girls go
to school together.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.020
I know! I know!

26:03.104 --> 26:05.357
First on my list
is the Bixby school,

26:05.565 --> 26:06.691
which is known
to be splendid.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.360
Have you considered
a school in the village

26:08.568 --> 26:09.819
run by Acacius Page?

26:10.070 --> 26:11.863
It follows ancient
Greek principles,

26:12.072 --> 26:13.615
and yet it's wonderfully
progressive.

26:13.823 --> 26:16.117
Your late brother's will
was most specific!

26:16.326 --> 26:17.577
"Conservative schooling,"
he said.

26:18.537 --> 26:20.288
Of course, there's
always my Alma mater,

26:20.497 --> 26:21.581
St. Boniface,
in Massachusetts.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.208
Oh, no, no.
Too far away.

26:24.209 --> 26:26.461
You'd better settle
on the Browning school.

26:26.711 --> 26:28.588
It is known to be
eminently conservative,

26:28.797 --> 26:31.424
and this gives
the boys basic--

26:35.929 --> 26:38.974
oh, oh...That's
enough candy, dear.

26:39.182 --> 26:40.392
Oh, sorry.

26:40.850 --> 26:42.435
Not you,
Mr. Babcock.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.062
You can have
all you want.

26:44.271 --> 26:45.397
Ah!

26:45.605 --> 26:47.315
Now, have you thought
of the Dillman school?

26:47.524 --> 26:48.400
That's right here--

26:48.608 --> 26:51.152
no, no. That's a little
too experimental.

26:51.361 --> 26:53.822
We want to keep the riffraff
out of the boy's life.

26:54.114 --> 26:57.701
The school we choose must be
exclusive and restricted.

26:57.951 --> 27:00.787
Exclusively what
and restricted to whom?

27:00.996 --> 27:04.082
We must spare the boy
certain influences

27:04.291 --> 27:06.751
from the <i>wrong</i> side
of the tracks,

27:06.960 --> 27:08.253
shall we say?

27:10.463 --> 27:11.631
Mr. Babbitt--

27:11.881 --> 27:12.966
Babcock.

27:13.842 --> 27:14.884
Oh, yes...

27:15.468 --> 27:16.845
It was very good
of you to come.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.471
What school is it
going to be?

27:18.680 --> 27:19.848
You name the school
of your choice.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.183
Patrick and I will
know what to do.

27:22.392 --> 27:23.560
I'd say Bixby.

27:24.102 --> 27:25.937
Uh, then,
bully for Bixby.

27:26.271 --> 27:27.939
I'll make out a check
to the Bixby school.

27:28.148 --> 27:29.482
You'll take the boy down
and register him.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.443
Whatever you say.

27:31.651 --> 27:35.280
I say I'm very happy
to have met you.

27:35.947 --> 27:36.781
After the reports
I'd heard,

27:36.990 --> 27:39.117
I was prejudiced,
and not in your favor.

27:39.326 --> 27:40.493
Tch, tch, tch.

27:40.702 --> 27:44.956
I find you a woman
with a very powerful charm.

27:45.874 --> 27:48.710
And you're a man with
a very powerful bank.

27:48.918 --> 27:51.338
Ha ha ha!

27:51.546 --> 27:53.590
Floor all
scrubbed, Fraulein Dennis.

27:53.798 --> 27:55.508
Clean just like old country.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.720
I go now, I get lamb chops,
bottle milk for boy.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.138
Pick up my coat!

28:00.347 --> 28:01.097
Bye,
Auntie Vera!

28:01.348 --> 28:02.515
Bye, kid!

28:49.020 --> 28:50.522
Don't drop anything,
Lindsay.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.774
Oh, what a marvelous
October day,

28:52.982 --> 28:54.693
October's
bright blue weather.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.028
All we've seen is the inside
of department stores.

28:57.237 --> 28:58.988
Haven't even had a chance
to call my office.

28:59.197 --> 29:01.741
Oh, stop complaining,
Lindsay!

29:02.575 --> 29:05.203
Mame, when will we have
some time to ourselves?

29:05.912 --> 29:08.373
Time...oh, Lindsay,
don't you realize

29:08.581 --> 29:09.999
I've had to make up
for--oh, thank you--

29:10.208 --> 29:12.210
Patrick's 10 neglected
years in a few months.

29:12.419 --> 29:14.045
Dr. Spock says
it's impossible.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.047
Does Dr. Spock
also happen to mention

29:16.256 --> 29:17.507
the child needs a father?

29:17.716 --> 29:18.466
Tch, tch, tch.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.969
A lot of women think
I'm reasonably attractive.

29:21.177 --> 29:22.262
Don't start that
again.

29:22.470 --> 29:23.471
Besides, how can I
be a wife?

29:23.680 --> 29:25.140
I'm too busy
being a mother.

29:27.183 --> 29:28.184
Oh! Oh--

29:28.393 --> 29:30.019
oh--one moment, uh--

29:30.270 --> 29:31.938
thank you. Thank you.

29:32.147 --> 29:32.981
Oh, my hat!

29:33.857 --> 29:35.066
Oh, thank you.

29:35.316 --> 29:37.235
Oh, I do hope
that Patrick likes

29:37.444 --> 29:39.237
the chemistry set,
the books, the atlas,

29:39.446 --> 29:40.530
the Kipling.

29:40.739 --> 29:43.366
Mame, I don't like
your latest fad.

29:43.575 --> 29:44.743
Fad--Patrick?

29:44.951 --> 29:46.369
Yes. I've seen you
through yogi,

29:46.578 --> 29:47.704
soap sculpture,
modern dance,

29:47.912 --> 29:48.913
and nature foods.

29:49.122 --> 29:50.248
I've seen you
take each one up

29:50.457 --> 29:51.541
as if nothing
else existed,

29:51.750 --> 29:53.042
then I've seen you
drop them all.

29:53.251 --> 29:54.335
You think Patrick

29:54.544 --> 29:55.587
is just a temporary
enthusiasm?

29:55.795 --> 29:57.964
It's called molding
a new little life.

29:58.173 --> 29:59.174
Don't be ridiculous!

29:59.382 --> 30:00.717
You've been in a mood
all day long.

30:00.925 --> 30:03.595
There you are, you deceitful,
irresponsible bohemian!

30:03.803 --> 30:05.597
Mr. Babcock,
whatever do you mean?

30:05.805 --> 30:07.307
You're no more fit
to raise a child than Jezebel!

30:07.515 --> 30:08.767
My little love!
Something's happened to him!

30:08.975 --> 30:10.769
Come here,
you little heathen!

30:11.144 --> 30:12.395
Patrick, Patrick,
what's wrong?

30:12.604 --> 30:13.521
He came over
to my school--

30:13.730 --> 30:15.064
I'll tell you
what's wrong!

30:15.273 --> 30:17.066
I dropped by
the Bixby school.

30:17.275 --> 30:19.319
I find he isn't even
registered there.

30:19.527 --> 30:20.487
He never has been!

30:20.695 --> 30:21.780
So I have been
hunting through

30:22.030 --> 30:24.115
every low, crackpot school
in this town.

30:24.324 --> 30:26.242
I finally found him
in the lowest of them all!

30:26.451 --> 30:28.411
Mr. page
is a progressive educator.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.789
There they were,
a schoolroom full of them--

30:30.997 --> 30:32.707
boys, girls, teachers--

30:32.916 --> 30:34.626
romping around
stark naked,

30:34.834 --> 30:36.461
bare as the day
they were born!

30:36.669 --> 30:38.880
I assure you the children
under Mr. page's care

30:39.088 --> 30:41.591
were engaged in healthful,
broadening pursuits.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.468
Broadening!
You show them

30:43.676 --> 30:45.845
what you were doing
when I broke into that place!

30:46.054 --> 30:48.181
We were playing
fish family,

30:48.389 --> 30:49.682
a part of
constructive play.

30:49.891 --> 30:50.600
Listen to this!

30:50.809 --> 30:52.060
Show me, darling.

30:52.268 --> 30:54.479
We do it after
yogurt time.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.606
Mrs. page
and all the girls

30:56.815 --> 30:59.067
crouch on the floor
under the sun lamps.

30:59.275 --> 31:01.027
They pretend
to be lady fishes,

31:01.236 --> 31:03.279
depositing their
eggs in the sand.

31:03.655 --> 31:04.989
Then Mr. page
and all the boys

31:05.198 --> 31:07.075
do what
gentlemen fish do.

31:08.535 --> 31:10.620
What could be more
wholesome or natural?

31:11.579 --> 31:12.497
Natural?

31:13.164 --> 31:15.375
Well, it might be
natural for a sardine!

31:15.583 --> 31:16.960
Can you imagine
how I felt--

31:17.168 --> 31:19.838
Mr. Babcock, I consider
your behavior most undignified.

31:20.046 --> 31:22.590
Undignified? At least
I'm wearing a vest.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.008
Making a scene,

31:24.801 --> 31:25.885
causing what might well be

31:26.094 --> 31:28.096
a traumatic experience
for this child.

31:28.304 --> 31:29.722
I know how you can
twist things around.

31:29.931 --> 31:30.974
So I'm getting out
of this

31:31.182 --> 31:33.142
combination
nudist camp/opium den

31:33.351 --> 31:34.394
before you make me
look like

31:34.602 --> 31:36.312
the vice president
in charge of free love!

31:36.521 --> 31:40.358
Mr. Babcock,
not in front of the b-o-y!

31:43.069 --> 31:45.113
Tomorrow morning,
I, me, personally

31:45.321 --> 31:47.031
am taking this kid
off to boarding school.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.158
I am placing him
in St. Boniface academy

31:49.367 --> 31:50.577
where he will stay!

31:50.785 --> 31:52.537
You'll only get
your depraved hands on him

31:52.745 --> 31:53.746
Christmas and summer!

31:53.955 --> 31:55.331
And I wish to heaven
there was some way

31:55.540 --> 31:56.791
I could stop you
from doing that!

31:57.041 --> 31:58.167
Auntie Mame,
do I have to?

31:58.376 --> 31:59.669
Please, Mr. Babcock
I'll do whatever you say,

31:59.919 --> 32:01.129
so long as the boy
can stay with me.

32:01.337 --> 32:02.714
He goes, and he
goes tomorrow!

32:02.922 --> 32:04.048
Let's be reasonable--

32:04.257 --> 32:05.341
I'm going to turn
this kid into

32:05.550 --> 32:07.010
a decent god-fearing
Christian

32:07.218 --> 32:08.011
if I have to break

32:08.219 --> 32:09.846
every bone
in his body!

32:10.054 --> 32:11.180
If you'll give me
another chance--

32:11.389 --> 32:12.849
I wouldn't give you
the time of day

32:13.057 --> 32:14.893
after the dirty double-
cross you pulled on me!

32:15.101 --> 32:17.562
You can't take him!
He's all I have!

32:17.770 --> 32:18.521
You have him ready

32:18.730 --> 32:20.148
at 8:00 sharp
tomorrow morning!

32:20.356 --> 32:23.151
And, kid, you'd better
be wearing knickers!

32:27.864 --> 32:29.824
But I want to stay
with you, Auntie Mame!

32:30.033 --> 32:32.952
I don't want to go to
that old St. bony-face!

32:34.287 --> 32:36.205
Oh, now hush.

32:36.748 --> 32:38.625
Hush, my little love.

32:40.335 --> 32:42.253
Well, I, uh...

32:43.546 --> 32:46.507
I'm sure St. Boniface
is really very nice.

32:50.345 --> 32:52.221
You go upstairs
now, dear, and...

32:54.057 --> 32:55.558
Get ready for dinner
and...

32:56.559 --> 32:58.102
We'll talk
about it later.

33:19.415 --> 33:20.792
Lindsay...

33:21.793 --> 33:23.878
Lindsay,
what am I going to do?

33:26.297 --> 33:27.882
Mame, I'm sorry.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.134
Well, I, uh...

33:33.930 --> 33:35.682
I just don't think
I can bear it.

33:38.017 --> 33:39.644
I just don't.

33:42.814 --> 33:44.565
Mame, I...

33:45.984 --> 33:47.610
I've never seen
you cry before.

33:48.236 --> 33:49.237
Mame!

33:50.154 --> 33:53.491
Mame! Hey, Mame,
are you home?

33:53.700 --> 33:54.450
Is that you,
Vera?

33:54.701 --> 33:56.244
What on earth
does she want?

33:57.954 --> 33:59.622
Have you talked
to your stockbroker?

33:59.914 --> 34:01.666
Yes,
I can see you have.

34:01.874 --> 34:02.709
What about him?

34:02.917 --> 34:03.793
Don't you know?

34:04.002 --> 34:05.545
He's called me
half a dozen times

34:05.753 --> 34:06.838
trying to locate you.

34:07.046 --> 34:07.714
What happened?

34:07.922 --> 34:11.217
Oh, nothing, except nothing's
worth anything anymore.

34:14.887 --> 34:15.596
Hello.

34:15.804 --> 34:16.931
Don't you worry,
Mame.

34:17.181 --> 34:18.808
It can't possibly affect
people like you and me

34:19.016 --> 34:20.351
who have a lot of
solid stuff like

34:20.601 --> 34:22.103
bank of
the United States.

34:22.311 --> 34:24.480
Missy Dennis,
stockbroker want to say hello

34:24.688 --> 34:26.232
before he jump
out of window.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.906
How bad is it, Arthur?
Not bank of the United States?

34:35.783 --> 34:37.493
Atwater Kent, too?

34:40.913 --> 34:44.292
Mame...Mame,
I'm afraid you're wiped out.

34:44.500 --> 34:45.208
We all are.

34:45.418 --> 34:46.710
Everyone said
I was such a fool,

34:46.918 --> 34:48.629
spending all my
money at Tiffany's.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.716
Who gives a darn about money?
I've lost my child.

34:51.924 --> 34:52.800
What?

34:53.009 --> 34:54.844
Patrick's trustee's
sending him away to school.

34:55.303 --> 34:58.181
Oh, Mame, darling,

34:58.389 --> 35:00.850
I know
how you must feel.

35:03.519 --> 35:04.395
Do you?

35:04.687 --> 35:06.355
Of course I do!

35:06.731 --> 35:07.523
I never
had a child,

35:07.732 --> 35:09.108
but after all
I am an actress.

35:09.317 --> 35:10.359
I can imagine.

35:10.568 --> 35:12.820
Vera, there must be
something I can do!

35:13.071 --> 35:15.782
I've got it--
the perfect solution!

35:15.990 --> 35:18.576
It'll solve everything!
You're going to work.

35:18.785 --> 35:20.036
Work? What at?

35:20.244 --> 35:21.162
You'll return
to the stage

35:21.370 --> 35:23.331
in my play,
<i>Midsummer Madness!</i>

35:23.581 --> 35:25.333
There are dozens of
parts to go around!

35:25.541 --> 35:27.210
We open Thanksgiving
in new haven.

35:27.418 --> 35:29.337
I'll call up Max
first thing.

35:29.545 --> 35:30.421
Do you think
I could?

35:30.630 --> 35:33.007
Of course, you could.
Couldn't she, Lindsay?

35:33.216 --> 35:35.676
Let's face it--you'll have
to work at something.

35:35.885 --> 35:37.970
Now, the only chance
of getting Patrick back

35:38.179 --> 35:39.931
is to show this Babcock
you've settled down

35:40.139 --> 35:42.183
into something steady
like acting.

35:43.226 --> 35:44.852
Or to earn the money
to fight him with!

35:45.061 --> 35:47.146
Oh, Vera, Vera,
you're so right!

35:47.355 --> 35:49.315
$500 a week to start,
wouldn't you say?

35:49.524 --> 35:51.901
It'll only be a bit at
the end of the last act.

35:52.110 --> 35:55.071
Then there'll be a raise!
Oh, I accept!

35:55.321 --> 35:57.615
Your heart
is from Tiffany's, too.

35:57.824 --> 35:59.325
It'll be
like old times,

35:59.534 --> 36:01.953
when we were trouping together
in <i>Chu-Chin-Girl.</i>

36:02.161 --> 36:04.038
I can't wait
to hear that overture!

36:04.247 --> 36:06.415
Mame, this is
a serious drama.

36:06.624 --> 36:08.292
I was in the front row
of the chorus.

36:08.501 --> 36:09.252
Vera was behind me.

36:09.460 --> 36:10.837
Behind you? If
I'd been behind you,

36:11.045 --> 36:11.963
I'd have
kicked you in--

36:12.171 --> 36:13.673
Vera! I know exactly
what I did.

36:13.881 --> 36:14.715
I used to go...

36:14.924 --> 36:16.384

Aah!

37:18.696 --> 37:20.072
An appalling situation.

37:20.323 --> 37:21.532
Frightful, my dear.

37:21.782 --> 37:22.617
Where's Miss Dennis?

37:22.825 --> 37:23.868
It's nearly time
for her entrance.

37:24.076 --> 37:26.037
Keep your shirt on.
She's still making up.

37:27.705 --> 37:29.874
Lady Iris--a lousy,
2-line bit.

37:30.124 --> 37:32.084
She's had 2 1/2 acts
to make up.

37:32.293 --> 37:33.502
You get her
up here quick.

37:33.711 --> 37:35.087
And make sure she
knows her entrance

37:35.379 --> 37:36.380
is from
the other side.

37:36.589 --> 37:38.257
In all fairness
to the boy,

37:38.466 --> 37:40.176
I believe she's been
leading him on.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.845
After all,
she is a Princess,

37:43.054 --> 37:44.388
he, a commoner.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.974
Oh, dear. Everybody
into the solarium.

37:47.183 --> 37:48.851
I think I hear them
coming now.

37:49.101 --> 37:52.104
But, Reginald,
to do such a thing,

37:52.313 --> 37:54.774
to dash away
together like this

37:54.982 --> 37:55.900
would be mad...

37:58.110 --> 37:59.987
Quite
devastatingly mad.

38:01.739 --> 38:04.909
Quite
devastatingly mad!

38:05.159 --> 38:06.410
When?

38:06.619 --> 38:08.287
Ah ha ha ha!

38:08.496 --> 38:11.999
Lord Dudley, your flattery would
turn a young girl's head!

38:12.208 --> 38:13.709
Come, now.
Hurry to the ball.

38:13.918 --> 38:15.294
If we tarry,
we shall be late.

38:15.503 --> 38:19.423
Ha ha ha!

38:21.175 --> 38:22.134
No, Reginald.
It would be madness.

38:22.343 --> 38:25.346
I belong to one world,
you to another.

38:26.138 --> 38:27.598
It's better we part now,

38:27.807 --> 38:32.186
now while we Cherish
this ecstasy we've known.

38:32.395 --> 38:34.981
What the hell have you
got back there? Reindeer?

38:35.189 --> 38:37.441
This is good-bye,
Reginald.

38:37.650 --> 38:39.986
I hear
the others coming.

38:42.363 --> 38:44.490
Ah ha ha ha!

38:44.824 --> 38:46.867
Oh, lord Dudley,
oh, no more champagne

38:47.076 --> 38:48.327
or I shall forget
myself altogether.

38:48.536 --> 38:49.996
Ha ha ha!

38:50.204 --> 38:51.539
I have--

38:51.747 --> 38:53.416
you're
the funniest man--

38:53.624 --> 38:55.960
<i>I</i> have something
to tell you!

38:57.670 --> 38:59.922
I have been unexpectedly
called back home.

39:00.131 --> 39:01.882
Prince Alex needs me,

39:02.091 --> 39:04.552
and my place
is by his side.

39:04.802 --> 39:05.511
It has all been

39:05.720 --> 39:08.264
so lovely
this whole summer,

39:08.472 --> 39:09.598
but after all,

39:09.807 --> 39:14.270
it has only been
midsummer madness.

39:15.688 --> 39:18.024
Lady Iris, would you
be good enough

39:18.274 --> 39:20.484
to <i>ring</i>
for my wrap?

39:20.693 --> 39:22.611
Certainly, Princess.

39:25.197 --> 39:28.117
And get rid of
those damn cowbells!

39:30.619 --> 39:32.455
May I help you,
Princess?

39:32.663 --> 39:34.498
Thank you, lady...
Iris.

39:42.131 --> 39:44.258
Good-bye,
good-bye.

39:44.467 --> 39:45.801
I shall always feel

39:46.010 --> 39:48.054
a strong attachment
to you all.

39:49.764 --> 39:50.765
Let go!

39:50.973 --> 39:51.932
I can't.
I'm stuck.

39:52.183 --> 39:53.267
Let go!

39:55.561 --> 39:56.645
Vera, I'm stuck!

39:56.854 --> 39:58.397
It's my bracelet.
It's caught!

39:58.606 --> 39:59.482
Bring down
the curtain!

39:59.690 --> 40:00.524
Hold still a minute!
Vera!

40:00.733 --> 40:01.650
Places!

40:05.404 --> 40:06.781
I was trying to--

40:06.989 --> 40:09.658
ruining my beautiful play
with your lousy bell-ringing!

40:13.412 --> 40:14.288
These are the only
bracelets I have

40:14.497 --> 40:15.581
in the world.

40:15.790 --> 40:17.416
That's
all I've got--

40:19.043 --> 40:20.461
Enough!
That's enough!

40:22.004 --> 40:23.422
Psst! Psst!

40:27.718 --> 40:28.677
Ooh!

40:37.520 --> 40:38.396
Aah!

40:40.147 --> 40:41.357
OK,
strike the set!

40:41.649 --> 40:43.401
You did this
deliberately! Why?

40:43.609 --> 40:44.777
I wanted to make
something

40:45.069 --> 40:46.112
out of
lady Iris.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.780
You scene-stealing
society biddy!

40:47.988 --> 40:48.948
You've destroyed me!

40:49.156 --> 40:50.908
There were critics
out there.

40:51.117 --> 40:52.868
We're ruined!
We're all ruined!

40:53.077 --> 40:54.954
Never let me
catch a sight

40:55.162 --> 40:56.914
of your
evil face again,

40:57.123 --> 40:58.874
you...you assassin!

40:59.083 --> 41:01.919
But, Vera!
Vera--you see--you don't--

41:02.128 --> 41:05.423
I felt if I should just
make something out--

41:05.631 --> 41:07.383
well, there weren't
many lines,

41:07.591 --> 41:09.468
and I felt that--

41:12.513 --> 41:14.014
Miss Charles asked...

41:59.435 --> 42:01.061
I thought you were
very good, Auntie Mame.

42:01.270 --> 42:01.979
Ohh!

42:02.188 --> 42:03.355
Everybody noticed you.

42:04.773 --> 42:06.859
Oh, my little love.

42:07.693 --> 42:08.903
How did you
get up to new haven?

42:09.111 --> 42:10.988
Ito brought me up.

42:11.864 --> 42:12.740
How could Ito
drive you up

42:12.948 --> 42:14.658
when I've already
sold the car?

42:14.909 --> 42:16.911
He didn't drive.
We hitchhiked.

42:17.703 --> 42:18.454
Mr. Babcock thinks

42:18.662 --> 42:20.414
you're in that
horrible school.

42:20.623 --> 42:23.834
It's all right, Auntie Mame.
It's Thanksgiving vacation.

42:25.628 --> 42:27.087
Is it?

42:30.466 --> 42:32.301
Can I be your escort?

42:32.510 --> 42:35.429
Can I take you back
to your hotel?

42:39.225 --> 42:40.184
You can take me

42:40.392 --> 42:43.062
all the way back
to New York.

42:45.898 --> 42:47.107
Patrick...

42:48.692 --> 42:50.152
Oh, Patrick...

42:52.154 --> 42:55.074
Are you ashamed
of your Auntie Mame?

42:56.075 --> 42:57.868
I'm proud of you!

42:58.410 --> 43:00.329
Nobody liked
the stinky old play at all

43:00.538 --> 43:02.164
until you came in.

43:17.388 --> 43:19.014
Lady Iris.

43:25.479 --> 43:27.398
Charmed...

43:28.691 --> 43:30.401
Lord Dudley.

44:05.894 --> 44:08.105
Widdicombe, Gutterman,
Applewhite, Bibberman and Black.

44:08.355 --> 44:09.481
You want to talk
to Mr. Gutterman.

44:09.690 --> 44:11.275
One moment, sir.
I'll connect you.

44:12.985 --> 44:15.195
Widdicombe, Gutterman,
Applewhite, Bibberman and Black.

44:15.404 --> 44:17.239
Oh, oh, ha.
Yes, Mr. Bibberman.

44:17.448 --> 44:18.657
You'd like to talk
to Mr. Applewhite.

44:18.907 --> 44:20.117
Yes, sir, he's in.
I'll connect you.

44:20.326 --> 44:22.328
Oh, uh--uh--

44:22.536 --> 44:24.121
Widdicombe, Gutterman,
Applewhite,

44:24.330 --> 44:25.748
Bib-Bib-berman and Black.

44:25.956 --> 44:27.750
Yes, long distance.
How are you?

44:27.958 --> 44:29.918
Y-uh-hold--
uh, Mr. Widdicombe,

44:30.127 --> 44:32.129
I have your San Francisco
call for you.

44:33.672 --> 44:35.007
Yes, Mr. Bibberman?

44:35.215 --> 44:37.051
Oh...did I connect you

44:37.259 --> 44:38.802
with Mr. Gutterman
instead of Mr. Applewhite?

44:39.053 --> 44:41.805
I'm sorry, Mr. Bibbicombe.
Uh--Bib-Bib-Bib-Bib...

44:42.014 --> 44:44.141
Oh, Mr. Applewhite,
what are you doing in that hole

44:44.350 --> 44:46.143
with Mr. Gutterman?

44:46.352 --> 44:47.645
Yes, Mr. Widdicombe?

44:47.853 --> 44:50.147
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I'll try to reconnect you again

44:50.356 --> 44:51.607
with San Francisco.

44:51.815 --> 44:53.567
Let me see...
Mr. bib-bib-bib is in there...

44:53.776 --> 44:55.736
Talking to Mr. Bubberwhite...
Where is Mr. Applewhite?

44:55.944 --> 44:57.738
Oh, there you are,
Mr. Applewhite!

44:57.946 --> 45:00.157
Mr. Widdicombe, there's no
such place as San Francisco.

45:02.409 --> 45:03.160
Please, I--

45:10.626 --> 45:12.586

45:35.192 --> 45:36.819
Roller-skate lady!

45:37.069 --> 45:39.321
Where is
the roller-skate lady?

45:39.530 --> 45:42.199
That stupid sales clerk
sent me 2 left skates.

45:42.449 --> 45:44.368
Does Macy think my son
has 2 left feet?

45:44.576 --> 45:46.161
Is that what you think?

45:46.370 --> 45:48.706
If you'll just be patient.
Roller-skate lady!

45:48.914 --> 45:51.208
Where is the
roller-skate lady?

45:51.417 --> 45:53.585
I don't know how
I got over in Tinkertoys.

45:53.794 --> 45:55.546
All I want is a pair
of those skates.

45:55.796 --> 45:58.507
One moment. Mr. Loomis,
will you help me

45:58.716 --> 46:01.176
with my sales slip,
please?

46:01.385 --> 46:04.304
Let me send
these things C.O.D.,

46:04.513 --> 46:07.224
then you wouldn't
have to pay any money.

46:07.474 --> 46:08.892
Well, I would,
eventually.

46:09.101 --> 46:11.562
Of course, but why
worry about it now?

46:11.812 --> 46:14.732
<i>Apres moi,
le deluge, eh?</i>

46:14.940 --> 46:16.900
Here's your slip.
It's so simple.

46:17.109 --> 46:18.569
No bulky bundles to carry

46:18.777 --> 46:20.404
or lose en route,
as it were.

46:20.612 --> 46:22.448
I just love C.O.D.!

46:22.656 --> 46:24.408
Excuse me, ma'am.

46:24.616 --> 46:26.076
Oh, ma'am?

46:26.285 --> 46:28.829
Just one moment,
please. Yes.

46:29.121 --> 46:30.581
<i>Yes!</i>

46:31.790 --> 46:32.750
I wonder if
could you assist me

46:32.958 --> 46:33.959
in ordering 24 pair

46:34.168 --> 46:36.044
of those fine-looking
roller skates?

46:36.253 --> 46:37.254
24 pair!

46:37.504 --> 46:40.507
My, what a proud father
you must be!

46:40.799 --> 46:43.385
Oh, no, I'm a single
gentleman, ma'am,

46:43.594 --> 46:45.262
but there's
a lot of little tykes

46:45.471 --> 46:47.264
at Oglethorpe Orphanage
just outside of Savannah

46:47.514 --> 46:49.057
that'll be happy to see
that package arrive.

46:49.266 --> 46:50.934
That is a nice
thing to do.

46:51.143 --> 46:52.561
I must say,
it's the true Christmas--

46:52.770 --> 46:54.730
how much does that
come to, little lady?

46:55.564 --> 46:58.400
You want to pay?
Cash?

46:58.609 --> 46:59.359
Oglethorpe orphanage,

46:59.568 --> 47:00.861
RFD 2, Savannah,
Georgia.

47:01.069 --> 47:03.822
Wouldn't you prefer if I sent
these skates C.O.D.?

47:04.072 --> 47:06.617
Well, I don't believe
that the little nippers

47:06.867 --> 47:08.619
would think much
of their Santy Claus

47:08.827 --> 47:10.245
if he filled
their stocking

47:10.454 --> 47:12.289
with bills for
collection on delivery.

47:15.042 --> 47:17.294
You see, I haven't
worked here very long.

47:17.544 --> 47:19.546
The only kind of sales slip
I know how to make out

47:19.755 --> 47:21.215
is C.O.D.

47:22.382 --> 47:24.426
I might be able to be
of some assistance.

47:24.635 --> 47:25.844
I've got
more than a passing

47:26.053 --> 47:27.888
familiarity here
with financial matters.

47:30.349 --> 47:31.767
First thing,
you've got to get

47:31.975 --> 47:33.644
all your duplicates and
triplicates straight,

47:33.852 --> 47:35.562
elsewise Mr. Macy
wouldn't have any way

47:35.854 --> 47:36.939
of knowing
what you sold.

47:37.147 --> 47:38.440
Oh, that's why
they have

47:38.649 --> 47:39.691
all that
tissue paper.

47:39.900 --> 47:40.943
There we are.

47:41.193 --> 47:41.985
There's a nice new
order blank, now.

47:42.194 --> 47:43.153
First the name--

47:43.862 --> 47:48.992
Beauregard Jackson
Pickett Burnside.

47:49.201 --> 47:50.494
That's a lot.
You took up all that space!

47:50.702 --> 47:52.079
They never make them
big enough!

47:52.287 --> 47:55.499
Miss Dennis, may I enquire
exactly what is going on?

47:55.707 --> 47:58.627
The nice gentleman was
helping me. I called you.

47:58.919 --> 47:59.670
This young lady--

47:59.920 --> 48:00.671
Miss Dennis,
is that your name--

48:00.879 --> 48:02.297
she was having
trouble with

48:02.506 --> 48:03.632
the sales slip

48:03.924 --> 48:05.717
for 24 pairs
of roller skates.

48:05.926 --> 48:08.011
Was there something unusual
about the order?

48:08.262 --> 48:09.680
Yes. He wanted
to pay cash.

48:09.930 --> 48:11.723
Am I to understand
that a Macy employee

48:11.932 --> 48:13.934
doesn't know how to make
a cash sale?

48:14.142 --> 48:16.687
I'm a whiz at C.O.D.s.
You can tell by the book.

48:16.895 --> 48:20.107
Miss Dennis,
this sales book is a shambles!

48:21.400 --> 48:22.860
Good-bye, everybody,
and merry Christmas.

48:23.068 --> 48:24.528
You're...
you are...

48:24.736 --> 48:26.029
Listen here,
that young lady

48:26.238 --> 48:28.031
was doing the very best
she knew how.

48:28.282 --> 48:30.576
I consider myself entirely
responsible for this!

48:30.784 --> 48:32.911
The whole thing's
an unfortunate misunderstanding.

48:33.120 --> 48:35.622
Don't forget the skates
for the little nippers.

48:36.748 --> 48:38.625

49:50.989 --> 49:53.575
Well...they gave me
my Christmas vacation

49:53.784 --> 49:54.952
a little bit early.

49:55.369 --> 49:56.620
But I'm glad, really,

49:56.828 --> 49:58.830
'cause now it fits
with your vacation.

49:59.039 --> 50:01.166
We won't have to miss
even a day together.

50:01.375 --> 50:03.752
Oh, Patrick.
That's beautiful.

50:03.961 --> 50:05.671
A genuine Picasso,
hmm?

50:06.046 --> 50:08.382
His black-and-blue
period.

50:15.263 --> 50:17.641
It's almost a week
till Christmas...

50:19.518 --> 50:20.769
But open it.

50:21.311 --> 50:23.438
Oh, Patrick.

50:23.647 --> 50:24.815
Where did you
get the money?

50:25.065 --> 50:27.359
Mr. Leavitt
down at the pawnshop

50:27.567 --> 50:28.819
gave me
a very good price

50:29.027 --> 50:31.071
for my hockey stick
and microscope.

50:32.447 --> 50:34.574
I was getting tired
of microbes.

50:35.701 --> 50:39.204
Oh, my, my,
my, my, my!

50:39.413 --> 50:40.747
They're not
quite diamonds.

50:40.956 --> 50:42.207
Oh, darling!

50:43.166 --> 50:44.876
That's the most
beautiful bracelet

50:45.085 --> 50:46.211
I ever owned!

50:46.420 --> 50:47.379
Oh!

50:49.089 --> 50:50.048
Aw!

50:53.010 --> 50:54.136
Wiggle it.

50:56.138 --> 50:58.473
See! It doesn't
make any noise.

51:01.768 --> 51:04.146
I told the man
you had to have a quiet one

51:04.521 --> 51:06.231
for when you go
on the stage again.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.899
When you wear it
with your mink coat,

51:08.108 --> 51:10.444
you'll make a sensation
at Macy's.

51:10.694 --> 51:13.071
Oh, I've already made
a sensation at Macy's.

51:13.321 --> 51:15.115
And my mink coat is
at Mr. Leavitt's

51:15.323 --> 51:16.616
with your microscope.

51:18.285 --> 51:19.786
Well, if we're
having Christmas,

51:19.995 --> 51:21.788
let's have it
all the way around!

51:21.997 --> 51:25.292
Norah! Ito!
Come in, please!

51:28.462 --> 51:30.088
Yes,
Missy Dennis?

51:31.298 --> 51:33.175
Merry Christmas,
everyone!

51:33.383 --> 51:34.593
It isn't until
Tuesday, mum!

51:34.801 --> 51:37.637
Well, we need it now.
Let's go ahead and have it.

51:37.846 --> 51:41.224
Norah, Ito, Patrick.

51:42.434 --> 51:44.644
I did want to pay you
some of your back salary.

51:44.853 --> 51:47.272
Not another word
about it.

51:47.481 --> 51:48.899
We wouldn't think
of leaving you.

51:49.107 --> 51:51.276
No place else
get job anyhow.

51:51.485 --> 51:52.778
Ooh!

51:52.986 --> 51:55.072
It isn't 17 jewels, Ito.

51:55.280 --> 51:58.492
I'm not sure time is worth
decoration these days.

51:58.700 --> 51:59.993
Thank you,
Missy!

52:00.202 --> 52:03.747
French-smelling. I'll feel
as alluring as theda bara.

52:04.039 --> 52:06.333
Golly!
Long pants at last!

52:06.625 --> 52:08.919
Can I try them on
right now, Auntie Mame?

52:09.127 --> 52:10.587
Right now!

52:12.506 --> 52:13.715
Well, we've got

52:13.924 --> 52:16.468
a present for you,
too, Ito and me.

52:16.968 --> 52:18.220
I hope you won't
be angry

52:18.428 --> 52:19.763
for what we've done.

52:19.971 --> 52:21.389
Just what is it
you have done?

52:21.807 --> 52:24.184
Well, Ito had a bit
of money put by, and so did I,

52:24.392 --> 52:26.019
for a rainy day,
you might say.

52:26.228 --> 52:28.146
We both figured
it couldn't get much wetter

52:28.396 --> 52:29.940
than it is right now.

52:31.650 --> 52:33.276
We pay grocery
and butcher bill.

52:33.485 --> 52:34.361
Now Mr. Schultz

52:34.569 --> 52:37.364
no give nasty look
with lamb chop.

52:44.788 --> 52:46.957
You are both
so dear to me.

52:51.545 --> 52:53.505
I'll pay you back
one day.

52:56.550 --> 52:58.426
You know I will, if...

53:00.011 --> 53:02.055
If ever I can.

53:11.022 --> 53:12.482
You're a loving
woman, mum.

53:12.691 --> 53:15.235
Oh, you're odd,
but you're loving.

53:15.944 --> 53:18.405
All we wish is that
you could find a man,

53:18.905 --> 53:20.991
as wonderful and
as fine a gentleman

53:21.241 --> 53:22.993
as you are
a fine lady.

53:23.201 --> 53:24.536
Oh, Norah.

53:24.744 --> 53:27.164
Whatever happened to
Mr. Lindsay Woolsey?

53:27.372 --> 53:28.790
He was a nice man.

53:29.082 --> 53:32.586
Yes, he was a nice man.
I sent him away.

53:33.170 --> 53:34.588
I said no so many times
when I had money,

53:34.796 --> 53:37.090
I couldn't say yes
when I went broke.

53:37.299 --> 53:38.758
Look!

53:39.426 --> 53:42.512
Besides, I have
my own fine gentleman

53:42.721 --> 53:44.514
who gives me diamonds,

53:44.723 --> 53:46.850
or almost diamonds!

53:47.142 --> 53:49.394
Well, what we need
is some music.

53:49.603 --> 53:51.646

54:24.846 --> 54:26.514
Patrick,
go to her.

54:33.146 --> 54:34.731
Don't cry,
Auntie Mame.

54:34.940 --> 54:36.566
Please don't cry.

54:38.109 --> 54:38.944
Oh, hell.

54:39.152 --> 54:40.904
We don't even
have any Kleenex.

54:44.783 --> 54:48.078
If that's Santa Claus,
tell him we've already had it.

54:49.454 --> 54:51.289
Uh, howdy, howdy.

54:51.498 --> 54:53.250
Excuse me,
but I wondered if--

54:57.254 --> 54:58.797
I declare,
it's a miracle!

54:59.005 --> 55:00.298
That's what it is!

55:00.507 --> 55:02.425
It's a good old-fashioned
Christmas miracle!

55:02.634 --> 55:05.220
Ma'am, you've got no idea
how I am happy to see you!

55:05.428 --> 55:07.430
I don't know I'm quite
that happy to see you.

55:07.639 --> 55:08.974
I've been looking
all over for you.

55:09.224 --> 55:11.518
There are 97 Dennises

55:11.768 --> 55:13.103
in the Manhattan
directory alone!

55:13.311 --> 55:15.647
I was about to get out
my foreign visa

55:15.897 --> 55:16.856
and set sail for Brooklyn.

55:17.065 --> 55:18.024
Would you mind
telling me

55:18.233 --> 55:19.401
why you came here
in the first place?

55:19.651 --> 55:20.860
I went back to that counter.

55:21.069 --> 55:22.988
I had to apologize to you,
but you was gone.

55:23.196 --> 55:24.406
I told them right out,

55:24.656 --> 55:26.324
them Macy folks,
that they was wrong.

55:26.533 --> 55:30.912
A woman of your culture
and charm and refinement

55:31.121 --> 55:32.956
should have
an executive position

55:33.164 --> 55:34.791
with hired hands
to wrestle with

55:35.083 --> 55:37.210
them pesky figuring
and writing details.

55:37.460 --> 55:40.088
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

55:40.338 --> 55:42.007
I want to pay off
that nice taxi man

55:42.215 --> 55:44.009
so he can get home
to his family.

55:44.217 --> 55:47.429
You left a taxi meter running
in the middle of the depression?

55:47.637 --> 55:49.806
Well, ma'am,
I'm in oil.

55:50.015 --> 55:51.349
It just
keeps on gushing.

55:51.558 --> 55:54.144
There's not much
I can do about it.

55:54.352 --> 55:56.938
I'm all alone here in this
fair Metropolis of yours.

55:57.147 --> 55:59.816
If you wouldn't consider me
too presumptuous,

56:00.108 --> 56:03.028
I'd be most honored if you
let me squire you to dinner.

56:03.236 --> 56:04.654
No, thank you.

56:04.863 --> 56:06.489
We're having
a Christmas celebration.

56:06.698 --> 56:08.533
I can't leave
my little family.

56:08.742 --> 56:10.368
I can understand
that.

56:10.577 --> 56:12.370
I'm knee-deep
in family myself.

56:12.620 --> 56:13.621
Got acres of them.

56:13.830 --> 56:16.041
Come down Georgia way
and meet them all.

56:16.249 --> 56:17.917
I think you'd
just love Peckerwood.

56:18.126 --> 56:19.461
Peckerwood?
Who's Peckerwood?

56:19.669 --> 56:21.129
Oh, no, ma'am.

56:21.379 --> 56:23.673
That's the name of my
little ol' plantation.

56:23.882 --> 56:26.509
Say...maybe just
for tonight,

56:26.801 --> 56:28.678
I could be part of
your little ol' family,

56:28.887 --> 56:30.847
and we could all have
dinner together.

56:31.056 --> 56:32.307
No, really,
I'm not dressed.

56:32.599 --> 56:33.725
You look fine.

56:33.933 --> 56:35.810
Don't worry none
about that.

56:36.019 --> 56:36.811
A little powder

56:37.062 --> 56:38.730
on that nose,
and you look...

56:43.360 --> 56:44.778
Just fine.

56:48.823 --> 56:51.242
Look here, I'll tell
that nice taxi man to wait.

56:51.451 --> 56:52.744
Yeah!

56:52.952 --> 56:55.580
Marry him, mum,
the minute he asks you!

56:55.914 --> 56:56.998
Norah!

56:57.207 --> 56:58.541
What's his name?

56:58.792 --> 57:00.502
You don't even
know his name.

57:00.710 --> 57:01.669
Of course I do!

57:01.878 --> 57:02.921
We are about to
break bread with

57:03.129 --> 57:06.132
Beauregard Jackson...
Pickett Burnside!

57:06.341 --> 57:07.425
Norah, get your coat.

57:07.717 --> 57:09.094
Ito, change your jacket.

57:09.386 --> 57:10.470
Darling, now hurry, hurry!

57:10.678 --> 57:11.930
And you better bring
your scarf!

57:12.138 --> 57:13.640
It's cold outside!

57:14.516 --> 57:16.768
Norah, don't forget
to take your apron off.

57:21.398 --> 57:23.274
Ito, hurry!

57:26.986 --> 57:28.780
Oh, I was just going
to give you

57:29.072 --> 57:30.281
this wee thing
at dinner.

57:30.490 --> 57:31.825
Oh, Norah,
you're an angel.

57:32.033 --> 57:34.953
Wait, there must be
one for you--ah!

57:35.203 --> 57:36.913
Me never believe
in Santa Claus.

57:37.122 --> 57:38.790
Me beginning
to change mind!

57:39.082 --> 57:40.375
Well, I never did think
Santa Claus

57:40.583 --> 57:42.127
would have
a Southern accent!

57:44.587 --> 57:47.006
Merry Christmas
from Manny, Moe, and Jack,

57:47.215 --> 57:48.216
your credit clothiers.

57:48.425 --> 57:49.801
Well, merry Christmas
to you all,

57:50.009 --> 57:50.802
Manny, Moe, and Jack,

57:51.010 --> 57:53.471
and a happy little 'ol
new year!

58:04.983 --> 58:06.359
Well, good morning,
ma'am.

58:06.568 --> 58:07.861
Where's my snuffbox?

58:08.069 --> 58:10.572
What son of a no-good hound dog
stole my snuffbox?

58:10.780 --> 58:12.574
It's in your lap,
mother Burnside.

58:12.782 --> 58:14.033
Beauregard, where is she?

58:14.242 --> 58:16.077
I don't see
any New York filly here,

58:16.327 --> 58:19.122
just the same old lovin'
family group standin' around

58:19.330 --> 58:21.833
waiting to be mentioned
in my will.

58:22.167 --> 58:24.836
Afternoon to y'all...
Vultures.

58:25.086 --> 58:26.129
Afternoon...

58:26.337 --> 58:27.630
Now, now,
Mrs. Burnside.

58:27.881 --> 58:30.008
That doesn't
include me, does it?

58:30.216 --> 58:32.969
No, Sally Cato.
You ain't no vulture.

58:33.178 --> 58:34.929
You're just
a dead pigeon.

58:35.138 --> 58:36.473
Ah--ah--

58:36.681 --> 58:37.974
Ah--ah--

58:38.183 --> 58:39.476
ah-choo!

58:39.684 --> 58:42.479
I can't see how
you let my Beauregard

58:42.687 --> 58:43.855
out of your nest.

58:44.105 --> 58:46.274
You should have sat on him
till you hatched him.

58:46.483 --> 58:47.775
- Son?
- Yes mother?

58:48.026 --> 58:50.195
We got
sweet Georgia peaches here.

58:50.945 --> 58:53.072
Don't know why you had to
go to the land of the enemy

58:53.281 --> 58:54.949
and bring back
a northern lemon!

58:55.158 --> 58:58.369
Let's keep our hominy grits
going in the right direction.

58:58.578 --> 59:00.955
My Auntie Mame,
Miss Dennis, I mean,

59:01.164 --> 59:03.041
says she'll be here
in just a moment.

59:03.249 --> 59:07.045
Well, now, what a lovable,
genteel little gentleman!

59:07.337 --> 59:08.254
Emory!

59:08.505 --> 59:09.756
You and my little brother

59:09.964 --> 59:13.510
gonna get along like a pair
of colts in a pasture.

59:14.344 --> 59:15.762
Emory!

59:17.639 --> 59:19.057
Your sister's
nice.

59:19.557 --> 59:22.101
Nice?
You're plumb crazy!

59:22.519 --> 59:24.020
She's the meanest
damn filly

59:24.229 --> 59:25.980
in the entire south!

59:26.189 --> 59:27.649
Mame, darling,
where are you?

59:27.857 --> 59:29.067
We're all
waiting on ya.

59:29.275 --> 59:31.236
Oh, I'm coming,
Beau, sugar.

59:31.444 --> 59:33.863
I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

59:34.072 --> 59:36.824
I'm just busting to meet
your sweet little old mother.

59:37.867 --> 59:39.869
Uh, mother, dear...

59:40.828 --> 59:43.915
I'd like to present
Miss Mame Dennis.

59:45.458 --> 59:48.795
Well, I must say,
Mrs. Burnside,

59:49.087 --> 59:51.548
you're everything
I ever expected...

59:51.756 --> 59:54.008
And quite a bit more.

59:54.217 --> 59:56.052
And these here
are my--

59:56.302 --> 59:57.845
- ah--ah--
- yes, wha--

59:58.096 --> 59:59.514
ah-choo!

59:59.764 --> 01:00:01.182
Bless you.

01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:03.268
These are the rest
of my kinfolks--

01:00:03.476 --> 01:00:06.062
the Jacksons, Picketts,
Burnsides,

01:00:06.312 --> 01:00:08.064
and Miss Sally Cato
MacDougall.

01:00:08.273 --> 01:00:11.067
You stay here
and have a nice chat.

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:13.069
I'll fix you
a special drink.

01:00:13.278 --> 01:00:15.154
Then we're going to
run along down,

01:00:15.363 --> 01:00:17.282
and I'll have you
meet my horses.

01:00:21.244 --> 01:00:22.161
Well, I...

01:00:23.538 --> 01:00:25.540
I can't tell you
how charming it is

01:00:25.748 --> 01:00:27.750
to meet all of, uh...

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.044
You all.

01:00:30.253 --> 01:00:31.963
Tell me,
Miss Dennis.

01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:33.798
May I call you
Mame?

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:35.008
Oh, please do!

01:00:35.258 --> 01:00:36.843
And you call me
Sally Cato, hear?

01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:38.344
Thank you!

01:00:38.595 --> 01:00:39.846
Tell me, was it horses
brought you

01:00:40.054 --> 01:00:41.389
and Beauregard
together?

01:00:41.598 --> 01:00:42.890
Horses?

01:00:43.141 --> 01:00:44.851
Why, horses are
the most important thing

01:00:45.059 --> 01:00:46.102
in Beau's life.

01:00:46.352 --> 01:00:48.104
Oh, I just
love riding.

01:00:48.313 --> 01:00:50.064
Up in New York,
hardly a day goes by,

01:00:50.273 --> 01:00:53.109
I don't have the sadd--
boots on.

01:00:53.318 --> 01:00:55.069
Up every morning
at the crack of dawn

01:00:55.278 --> 01:00:57.155
for a brisk canter
through central park.

01:00:57.447 --> 01:00:58.489
Now that settles it.

01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:01.117
In your honor,
we've got to have a hunt.

01:01:01.367 --> 01:01:02.619
A hunt?
Oh, a hunt.

01:01:02.827 --> 01:01:03.536
<i>A hunt?</i>

01:01:03.745 --> 01:01:04.871
Listen, everybody,

01:01:05.079 --> 01:01:07.415
Beauregard's gone
and surprised us all.

01:01:07.624 --> 01:01:09.792
Miss Dennis here is a prominent
northern horsewoman.

01:01:10.001 --> 01:01:11.294
I'm not prominent.

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:13.296
Naturally,
we'll have a hunt.

01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:15.214
Listen, dawn tomorrow,
and everybody's invited.

01:01:15.423 --> 01:01:17.175
We might not feel
like riding so early.

01:01:17.467 --> 01:01:19.260
Won't we have a lark,
all of us, sun up,

01:01:19.469 --> 01:01:22.430
leaping over those
hedges and river gaps

01:01:22.639 --> 01:01:24.891
and the hounds yapping
around those boulders?

01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:26.476
I tell you, Mame,

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:29.270
every eye in this county
is gonna be on you.

01:01:29.479 --> 01:01:30.521
If I'd only known.

01:01:30.813 --> 01:01:32.732
I didn't bring down
any of my riding togs.

01:01:32.982 --> 01:01:34.275
Don't you worry
about that, Mame.

01:01:34.484 --> 01:01:35.818
I got dozens of things
you could wear.

01:01:36.027 --> 01:01:37.320
What's your shoe size?

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:38.571
3b.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.157
That's marvelous!
Same as I wear.

01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:44.160
Oh, you <i>do</i> ride
astride, Mame, dear.

01:01:44.369 --> 01:01:46.162
Oh, no, no. No.
Sidesaddle.

01:01:46.412 --> 01:01:47.664
Daddy, the colonel,

01:01:47.872 --> 01:01:49.666
insisted
that I learn it.

01:01:49.874 --> 01:01:53.670
Said it was the only way
for a true lady to ride.

01:01:53.878 --> 01:01:55.797
So...graceful.
silly of him, of course.

01:01:56.005 --> 01:01:57.965
Nobody rides sidesaddle
these days,

01:01:58.216 --> 01:01:59.926
but it's the only way
I know how.

01:02:00.134 --> 01:02:02.053
Now, isn't that
just grand?

01:02:02.387 --> 01:02:05.223
I just happen to have
a little ol' sidesaddle.

01:02:05.431 --> 01:02:06.683
It'll do you fine.

01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:08.184
Refreshments, ladies?

01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:10.978
Oh, Beau, darling,
we're having a hunt,

01:02:11.187 --> 01:02:12.522
and your sweet
little Yankee girl

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:14.190
is riding sidesaddle.

01:02:14.399 --> 01:02:17.068
I won't permit it!
It's far too dangerous!

01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:18.611
But, darling,
she's insisted.

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.154
Oh, well...

01:02:20.363 --> 01:02:23.616
Anything Mame
says she can do, she can do.

01:02:23.825 --> 01:02:26.703
I tell you,
she is an amazing woman.

01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:28.204
Oh, Mame, sugar!

01:02:28.413 --> 01:02:30.707
I'm just going to
hold my breath

01:02:30.957 --> 01:02:32.667
until dawn tomorrow.

01:02:33.835 --> 01:02:35.294
Do that, honey.

01:02:42.135 --> 01:02:44.345
Patrick, stop looking
at the pictures.

01:02:44.554 --> 01:02:46.139
Read it to me, dear.
I'm listening.

01:02:46.639 --> 01:02:48.307
"How to ride a horse."

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:50.977
It says you should
always get on the horse

01:02:51.227 --> 01:02:52.478
from the left side.

01:02:52.687 --> 01:02:54.731
My left side
or the horse's left side?

01:02:55.064 --> 01:02:57.483
It doesn't say.
Listen to this.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.486
"Whenever a rider
approaches a strange mount,

01:03:00.695 --> 01:03:01.779
"he should fix
the animal in the eye

01:03:01.988 --> 01:03:03.197
with a masterful gaze."

01:03:03.448 --> 01:03:04.449
A masterful gaze.

01:03:04.657 --> 01:03:06.576
"Above all, remain calm,
for a horse

01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:08.536
"has a highly developed
sense of smell

01:03:08.745 --> 01:03:11.289
and reacts dangerously
when he smells fear."

01:03:11.497 --> 01:03:13.249
I hope he likes
Chanel no. 5.

01:03:13.499 --> 01:03:14.751
Hey, I didn't know
this.

01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:16.753
"Horses aren't native
to America."

01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:18.296
Darling, read me
something useful.

01:03:18.504 --> 01:03:20.798
I'm about to go over the top
any minute--sidesaddle!

01:03:21.007 --> 01:03:21.758
"Clearing fences."

01:03:21.966 --> 01:03:22.842
Clearing fences.

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:24.761
It says you should
always lean.

01:03:24.969 --> 01:03:26.137
"Jumping water hazards."

01:03:26.387 --> 01:03:27.513
Jumping water hazards.

01:03:27.722 --> 01:03:29.390
"Don't lean. Sit erect."

01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:30.683
Don't lean.
Sit erect.

01:03:30.892 --> 01:03:31.976
Oh, Patrick.
Say your prayers.

01:03:32.185 --> 01:03:32.935
Brush your teeth.

01:03:33.144 --> 01:03:34.061
Be good
to Norah and Ito

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:36.314
after I'm gone.

01:03:39.692 --> 01:03:42.320
I think Sally Cato
left a foot in this one.

01:03:42.528 --> 01:03:43.196
Let me help you.

01:03:43.404 --> 01:03:44.572
No, darling.
It's no use.

01:03:46.282 --> 01:03:49.035
Why are you going through
all this, Auntie Mame?

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:51.913
If I can only snag you
an uncle Beau,

01:03:52.121 --> 01:03:54.332
all our problems
will be solved.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.334
Besides,
there's another minor,

01:03:56.542 --> 01:03:59.086
relatively unimportant
little old thing.

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.881
I happen to be
in love with him.

01:04:02.757 --> 01:04:04.759
I like Beau.
I like him a lot.

01:04:04.967 --> 01:04:06.010
Then it's all settled.

01:04:06.219 --> 01:04:07.053
Not so fast.

01:04:07.261 --> 01:04:08.304
He hasn't asked me
anything yet.

01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:10.348
You dressed yet,
Mame, honey?

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.391
Come in,
Beau, darling.

01:04:14.185 --> 01:04:15.102
Oh, my.

01:04:15.311 --> 01:04:16.938
How handsome
you look!

01:04:17.146 --> 01:04:19.065
Well, likewise,
Mame.

01:04:19.273 --> 01:04:20.983
Aw...

01:04:26.656 --> 01:04:28.783
Hold it steady there,
will you?

01:04:29.075 --> 01:04:30.868
I want to get
a picture of this.

01:04:31.077 --> 01:04:31.953
That's it.

01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:35.039
Now give me a nice pose,
Mame, darling.

01:04:35.248 --> 01:04:36.582
Oh...

01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:38.084
A big smile.

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:39.418
That's a girl.

01:04:39.961 --> 01:04:41.254
There we are.

01:04:41.462 --> 01:04:44.257
You have now been
immortalized in celluloid.

01:04:44.465 --> 01:04:45.758
Oh, Beau!

01:04:45.967 --> 01:04:46.884
Patrick...

01:04:47.093 --> 01:04:50.304
Oh, you must have
left it in my room.

01:04:50.513 --> 01:04:52.306
I'll find it.

01:04:53.683 --> 01:04:55.101
Huh!

01:04:55.685 --> 01:04:56.477
Uh...

01:05:00.231 --> 01:05:01.065
Uh, Mame...

01:05:01.274 --> 01:05:02.316
Oh, oh.

01:05:02.525 --> 01:05:03.359
Uh...

01:05:04.861 --> 01:05:06.070
Well, thank you.

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:08.030
I got something
to say.

01:05:08.239 --> 01:05:09.115
I'll have to
say it fast

01:05:09.323 --> 01:05:10.283
because if I don't
say it fast,

01:05:10.491 --> 01:05:11.784
I'm not gonna
say it at all.

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:13.744
Talk slow then,
Beau, darling.

01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:16.622
I can listen fast.

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.291
Mame, you and I

01:05:18.499 --> 01:05:20.877
don't exactly come
from the same world.

01:05:21.586 --> 01:05:22.587
Yes, Beau.

01:05:23.462 --> 01:05:25.256
Mame, not that
I think I'm worth--

01:05:26.424 --> 01:05:28.342
well, there comes
a time in every life...

01:05:28.593 --> 01:05:30.511
Oh, yes.
Yes, Beau.

01:05:31.637 --> 01:05:33.222
I'm just going to
have to come right out

01:05:33.431 --> 01:05:34.682
and say it.

01:05:37.059 --> 01:05:38.519
Uh...

01:05:38.728 --> 01:05:40.021
Oh...

01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:42.940
I'm going to
ask you to...

01:05:44.817 --> 01:05:46.944
Mame,
would you--

01:05:47.153 --> 01:05:48.279
I mean,
could you--

01:05:48.487 --> 01:05:49.155
ye--

01:05:49.363 --> 01:05:50.281
Mame!

01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:51.908
Mame, darling!

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.744
It's me, Sally Cato.

01:05:55.161 --> 01:05:56.662
I just wanted to see
if there was anything--

01:05:56.913 --> 01:05:59.874
oh, hello, Beau.
Was I interrupting?

01:06:02.084 --> 01:06:03.753
There's the signal,
Mame, darling.

01:06:03.961 --> 01:06:05.379
Come on,
let's hurry!

01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:09.926
Well, shall we
to the hounds?

01:06:10.426 --> 01:06:12.595
Yeah. I'd love to
meet your family.

01:06:32.114 --> 01:06:33.282
Mame, sugar,

01:06:33.491 --> 01:06:35.076
we almost thought
you wasn't coming.

01:06:35.326 --> 01:06:36.577
Oh, morning,
everyone.

01:06:36.786 --> 01:06:38.621
Lovely day
for a hunt.

01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:41.123
Sugar, you look
absolutely dreamy.

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:42.959
Say, boys!

01:06:43.167 --> 01:06:44.919
You can bring
Miss Dennis' horse round now.

01:06:46.671 --> 01:06:48.422
Well,
what a break.

01:06:49.882 --> 01:06:51.842
Glorious weather
for the hunt.

01:06:53.344 --> 01:06:54.804
I thought perhaps
it might rain,

01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:56.764
we'd call
the whole thing off.

01:06:56.973 --> 01:06:58.641
Well, now.
Where are we riding to?

01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:00.977
Outside of the hounds,
of course.

01:07:01.769 --> 01:07:03.020
It's a good
10-mile course,

01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:04.730
for those
as makes it.

01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:06.357
Well, I can try.

01:07:07.191 --> 01:07:09.777
This way,
Auntie Mame.

01:07:12.446 --> 01:07:14.115
Morning,
Miss Dennis.

01:07:14.365 --> 01:07:16.450
Morning, morning.

01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:25.251
Well, has he?

01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:26.377
Not yet,

01:07:26.669 --> 01:07:28.504
so I die an old maid
sometime before lunch.

01:07:28.754 --> 01:07:30.006
No, you won't.

01:07:30.214 --> 01:07:32.717
You look convincing,
like a magazine cover.

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.301
<i>Horror stories.</i>

01:07:34.635 --> 01:07:35.469
Oh!

01:07:45.146 --> 01:07:46.439
What's in there?

01:07:46.647 --> 01:07:48.983
That's the horse
I picked out for you.

01:07:51.277 --> 01:07:52.653
What's his name?

01:07:52.987 --> 01:07:54.822
Meditation.

01:08:08.002 --> 01:08:10.337
I could trip you.
You'd only break a leg.

01:08:10.546 --> 01:08:13.549
I can't disgrace Beau
in front of all his people.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:20.805
Fix the animal in the eye
with a masterful gaze.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.309
Fix a master in the eye
with an animal gaze

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:24.727
in the asterful eye!

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.272
Fix the aster in the maze
with an animal guy!

01:08:40.326 --> 01:08:41.743
Whoa, whoa!

01:08:48.834 --> 01:08:51.629
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:08:55.216 --> 01:08:57.926
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:09:00.054 --> 01:09:01.013
Whoa, boy.

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:03.515
Whoa, whoa.

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:05.559
Hold it, hold it.

01:09:06.685 --> 01:09:07.394
Oh!

01:09:07.853 --> 01:09:08.520
Ah!

01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:17.113
Ow! Ooch!

01:09:31.836 --> 01:09:33.629
Well,
you look fit, Mame!

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:35.756
They're bringing the fox
up from the icehouse.

01:09:35.965 --> 01:09:37.424
Come on, let's go,
everybody!

01:09:42.638 --> 01:09:45.182
Whoa, boy.
Easy, now. Calm down.

01:09:46.559 --> 01:09:48.060
Ha ha ha!

01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:50.604
Good-bye, Yankee gal.

01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:12.251
Whoa!

01:10:16.338 --> 01:10:18.048
Where does she
think she's going?

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:19.758
Look at her go!

01:10:19.967 --> 01:10:22.511
Auntie Mame!
Fall off!

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.471
Watch
that flood wall!

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.348
Auntie Mame,
fall off!

01:10:27.016 --> 01:10:27.766
Fall off!

01:10:27.975 --> 01:10:29.226
Look out!
Look out!

01:10:29.935 --> 01:10:31.604
Aah!

01:10:31.812 --> 01:10:32.521
Danged if she

01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:33.939
didn't sail
clear over it!

01:10:34.732 --> 01:10:36.108
No hands!

01:10:46.452 --> 01:10:47.244
Whoop!

01:10:48.954 --> 01:10:50.289
Aah!

01:11:21.362 --> 01:11:22.738
Look at her ride!

01:11:22.947 --> 01:11:24.198
She's
passing everybody!

01:11:24.448 --> 01:11:26.200
She's passing
the master of the hounds!

01:11:26.408 --> 01:11:28.160
Mighty bad form,
passing the master!

01:11:28.369 --> 01:11:30.162
She's passing
the dogs!

01:11:30.996 --> 01:11:32.289
Mother
of Jefferson Davis!

01:11:32.665 --> 01:11:34.291
She's passing the fox!

01:11:38.087 --> 01:11:40.089
Mrs. Burnside!
Mrs. Burnside!

01:11:40.965 --> 01:11:42.508
I was driving by,
I thought I saw--

01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:44.593
that couldn't be
meditation, could it?

01:11:44.843 --> 01:11:46.178
Yeah. Fine bit
of horseflesh.

01:11:46.387 --> 01:11:48.055
He's a killer!
I got to stop this!

01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:59.775
They're all headed
back this way.

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:06.699
Hey, stay out of
them flower beds!

01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:09.451
Get them crazy horses
out of my bougainvillea!

01:12:12.788 --> 01:12:14.999
She's heading
for the icehouse!

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:25.676
Aah!

01:12:29.847 --> 01:12:31.682
Hey!
That's my car!

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:32.933
That's
county property!

01:12:33.142 --> 01:12:34.101
Aah!

01:12:39.898 --> 01:12:40.858
Ha!

01:12:41.734 --> 01:12:42.985
Mame!

01:12:43.694 --> 01:12:44.653
Mame!

01:12:45.321 --> 01:12:46.488
Mame, darling!
Where are you?

01:12:46.697 --> 01:12:47.656
She come
this way.

01:12:48.073 --> 01:12:49.325
There you are.

01:12:49.575 --> 01:12:51.744
Mame, darling,
are you all right?

01:12:51.952 --> 01:12:53.162
I caught
the brass ring.

01:12:53.537 --> 01:12:54.455
If I hadn't
grabbed on to this,

01:12:54.663 --> 01:12:55.873
I'd have been
in Nova Scotia.

01:12:56.081 --> 01:12:57.207
What happened
to the fox?

01:12:57.416 --> 01:12:59.168
Poor thing
is all tuckered out.

01:12:59.543 --> 01:13:00.294
Auntie Mame!

01:13:00.502 --> 01:13:01.462
Oh, my little love!

01:13:01.712 --> 01:13:03.088
Don't you worry.
I'm all right.

01:13:03.297 --> 01:13:06.592
As county veterinarian,
I commanded you 2 years ago

01:13:06.884 --> 01:13:08.844
to have that horse
meditation destroyed.

01:13:09.053 --> 01:13:11.138
Letting this little lady
ride this horse--

01:13:11.347 --> 01:13:12.765
superb horsewoman
that she is!

01:13:13.015 --> 01:13:15.017
That was pure
premeditated murder!

01:13:15.267 --> 01:13:16.852
Let's have 3 cheers,
everybody,

01:13:17.061 --> 01:13:19.605
for my little
Yankee Valkyrie.

01:13:20.064 --> 01:13:22.107
What a seat
that woman has!

01:13:22.316 --> 01:13:24.443
What
a magnificent seat!

01:13:24.693 --> 01:13:26.111
Look here, everybody!

01:13:26.362 --> 01:13:28.113
I want 3 cheers for...

01:13:28.322 --> 01:13:32.868
For the future Mrs. Beauregard
Jackson Pickett Burnside!

01:13:33.077 --> 01:13:33.869
Hip, hip...

01:13:34.078 --> 01:13:34.995
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

01:13:35.204 --> 01:13:36.622
Hip, hip...

01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:38.457
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

01:13:38.665 --> 01:13:39.500
Beau!

01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:41.126
Emory, come on home!

01:13:41.377 --> 01:13:44.463
Hot damn! My sister's
gonna bust a gut!

01:13:45.547 --> 01:13:47.216
What are you all
standing around here for?

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:48.801
Come back to the house,

01:13:49.009 --> 01:13:51.303
and we'll all have
a glass of whiskey.

01:13:51.512 --> 01:13:52.221
Oh, Beau.

01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:54.473
Come on, Mame, darling.

01:13:55.599 --> 01:13:56.850
Here we are.

01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:00.437
Say, Mame,
I'm sorry about...

01:14:00.646 --> 01:14:03.190
Well, about making
my proposal so public,

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.734
but you know that I'm
gonna do everything I can

01:14:05.943 --> 01:14:07.152
to make you happy.

01:14:07.361 --> 01:14:09.071
'Course, you're gonna
have to educate me,

01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:11.198
you know, make me
more Cosmopolitan.

01:14:11.407 --> 01:14:12.408
For a honeymoon,

01:14:12.616 --> 01:14:14.535
why don't we take
a trip around the world

01:14:14.743 --> 01:14:16.745
for a couple of years,
just you and me?

01:14:16.954 --> 01:14:19.081
Oh, Beau! That--

01:14:19.289 --> 01:14:21.208
darling,
excuse me a minute.

01:14:21.417 --> 01:14:22.167
Sure.

01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:25.796
Oh, my little love!

01:14:26.547 --> 01:14:28.048
Congratulations,
Auntie Mame.

01:14:28.841 --> 01:14:32.136
Your Auntie Mame's in love
and very, very happy.

01:14:32.344 --> 01:14:35.222
I won't see you
for a long time.

01:14:35.431 --> 01:14:37.182
Patrick...

01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:40.602
Oh, Patrick, nothing
can ever really separate us.

01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:43.063
And you'll join us
on all your vacations.

01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:45.941
The rest of the time,
you'll be busy at school.

01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:48.861
Tch. Aw. I'll just have
2 men in my life

01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:50.446
instead of one, hmm?

01:14:50.654 --> 01:14:52.322
And I'll write to you
every day, darling.

01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:54.032
I promise.
You don't think

01:14:54.241 --> 01:14:57.578
I'd run off and abandon you
to the Babcocks, do you?

01:14:58.328 --> 01:14:59.496
You're stuck with me

01:14:59.746 --> 01:15:01.415
whether you like it or not,
darling, forever.

01:15:01.665 --> 01:15:03.584
Now let me see you smile.
Where is it?

01:15:03.792 --> 01:15:06.211
I want to see it.
Up, up, up, up, up!

01:15:06.462 --> 01:15:08.839
Ah, that's my boy!
Ha ha ha!

01:15:09.047 --> 01:15:11.717
Can I ask you
just one question?

01:15:12.009 --> 01:15:15.137
How did you stay on
that horse?

01:15:15.387 --> 01:15:17.931
It was just like new haven
with the bracelet.

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:21.185
I got stuck,
but at the other end.

01:15:47.294 --> 01:15:48.837
Mame.

01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:31.255
"Dear Auntie Mame,

01:16:31.463 --> 01:16:33.173
"I plan to spend
this holiday

01:16:33.382 --> 01:16:35.384
with Mr. Babcock
in Darien."

01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:36.843
Hold it there,
Mame, darling.

01:16:37.052 --> 01:16:38.679
Now, no higher,
Beau.

01:16:40.514 --> 01:16:43.141
"Junior Babcock and I
have swell times there.

01:16:43.517 --> 01:16:45.269
"I have met the kids

01:16:45.519 --> 01:16:47.980
from practically all the best
families in Connecticut."

01:16:48.188 --> 01:16:49.815
Tch. Oh, dear.

01:17:03.829 --> 01:17:05.872
Beau, I have a feeling
we should be getting back.

01:17:06.123 --> 01:17:07.916
I think
Patrick needs me.

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:10.210
That last one was
the best one yet.

01:17:10.419 --> 01:17:11.878
Oh, good, darling.

01:17:14.047 --> 01:17:15.966
Did you remember
to put film in the camera?

01:17:16.174 --> 01:17:17.384
I sure did, hon--

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:19.303
oh, dang!

01:17:19.511 --> 01:17:20.887
Oh, up, up,
rover!

01:17:21.096 --> 01:17:22.598
Up, up! Oh...

01:17:31.565 --> 01:17:32.774
Mrs. Burnside.

01:17:32.983 --> 01:17:34.359
Oh, Mr. Babcock.

01:17:34.568 --> 01:17:35.694
So good
to see you again.

01:17:35.944 --> 01:17:37.112
Thank you.
Nice to see you.

01:17:37.321 --> 01:17:39.531
Oh, darling!

01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:41.033
Oh!

01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:42.784
Congratulations.

01:17:42.993 --> 01:17:44.244
Mame!

01:17:44.453 --> 01:17:46.204
Up here, Mame, honey.

01:17:46.413 --> 01:17:48.874
Give me
a nice smile now.

01:17:51.543 --> 01:17:52.919
I got you!

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:01.845
Mame, honey...

01:18:02.054 --> 01:18:03.221
Look up here.

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:04.556
Oh! Come, Patrick.

01:18:04.765 --> 01:18:06.391
Do be careful, darling.

01:18:07.059 --> 01:18:07.809
Now...

01:18:08.018 --> 01:18:09.728
Give me
a nice smile.

01:18:09.936 --> 01:18:11.980
Patrick, boy,
take off your hat.

01:18:12.981 --> 01:18:14.733
Now give me
a nice smile.

01:18:15.776 --> 01:18:17.402
That's it.

01:18:17.653 --> 01:18:18.904
Ah!

01:18:19.112 --> 01:18:20.572
I got it!

01:18:20.781 --> 01:18:21.823

01:18:47.391 --> 01:18:48.975

Hey, Dennis!

Thanks.

01:18:59.361 --> 01:19:01.446
Siam. "Dear Patrick,

01:19:01.738 --> 01:19:03.949
"here's a handy little woman
to have around the house.

01:19:04.157 --> 01:19:05.701
Love, Auntie Mame."

01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:09.496
What a doll!

01:19:11.039 --> 01:19:12.040
Look at that thing!

01:19:17.254 --> 01:19:18.130
Uh!

01:19:20.382 --> 01:19:21.383
Here we are,
Mame, darling.

01:19:21.591 --> 01:19:22.259
Oh!

01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:24.136
You all right?

01:19:26.054 --> 01:19:27.472
Next time, let's
take the elevator.

01:19:27.723 --> 01:19:28.974
It's 10,000 feet up.

01:19:29.182 --> 01:19:31.935
We only got
another mile to go.

01:19:32.144 --> 01:19:34.813
Why don't you stay here
and rest a little while?

01:19:35.021 --> 01:19:36.648
I'll go on up
a little higher.

01:19:36.857 --> 01:19:38.483
I want to get
some film on you, huh?

01:19:38.692 --> 01:19:39.901
I'll finish
Patrick's letter.

01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:41.486
All right.

01:19:44.489 --> 01:19:47.367
"Have to dash.
Dinner at uncle Dwight's.

01:19:47.617 --> 01:19:50.328
"That's Babcock
the baboon-faced boy, to you.

01:19:50.579 --> 01:19:53.039
"Actually,
old Babcock's rather sweet.

01:19:53.248 --> 01:19:55.917
"He's been introducing me
to all the blonde heiresses

01:19:56.126 --> 01:19:57.794
on the eastern seaboard."

01:19:58.003 --> 01:19:59.379
Blonde heiresses?

01:19:59.588 --> 01:20:00.922
Dwight?

01:20:01.131 --> 01:20:03.842
Beau? Beau?

01:20:04.092 --> 01:20:06.845
I knew that letter
was worrying you,

01:20:07.053 --> 01:20:08.680
so I already made
reservations back.

01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:10.348
Oh, good.

01:20:10.599 --> 01:20:12.267
Well, then
let's get back down.

01:20:12.517 --> 01:20:13.685
Wait a minute,
Mame.

01:20:13.935 --> 01:20:15.979
I still got a little
bit more film left.

01:20:16.188 --> 01:20:17.606
Mame,
would you mind

01:20:17.814 --> 01:20:19.274
stepping back
just a bit?

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:23.236
I'd rather not.

01:20:23.612 --> 01:20:25.947
Never mind. I'll
skittle up a mite.

01:20:26.156 --> 01:20:28.074
Now, Beau. No higher.

01:20:28.283 --> 01:20:30.952
Take this thing,
will you, honey?

01:20:31.161 --> 01:20:33.538
It keeps on getting
in my way.

01:20:33.747 --> 01:20:36.291
Take hold of the other end
for your balance.

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.667
Don't you worry
none, Mame.

01:20:37.876 --> 01:20:39.586
Just be looking out
at the view.

01:20:39.795 --> 01:20:41.880
Hold it now,
will you?

01:20:42.088 --> 01:20:44.424
Hold on tight
while I refocus.

01:21:20.377 --> 01:21:21.878
Good heavens!

01:21:22.087 --> 01:21:24.548
This place looks
like the main chapel

01:21:24.798 --> 01:21:26.550
of a funeral parlor.

01:21:26.758 --> 01:21:28.844
Haven't Norah and Ito
been alerted?

01:21:29.219 --> 01:21:30.345
They'll be here
tomorrow.

01:21:30.554 --> 01:21:33.014
What's that thing
supposed to be?

01:21:33.265 --> 01:21:34.516
It's a dictaphone.

01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:35.976
She'll never use it.

01:21:36.226 --> 01:21:39.312
Patrick's carried all this junk
up here for nothing.

01:21:39.563 --> 01:21:40.814
Mame can't stay still

01:21:41.022 --> 01:21:43.692
long enough
to write a post card,

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.151
let alone a book.

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.028
No, I think
the kid was right.

01:21:47.237 --> 01:21:49.155
Mame can't go on
living in a vacuum.

01:21:49.364 --> 01:21:51.157
She's always got to
have a project.

01:21:51.408 --> 01:21:53.368
She's got a project.

01:21:53.577 --> 01:21:55.245
Now she's
the tragic queen.

01:21:55.453 --> 01:21:57.038
She's having such fun
being miserable.

01:21:57.247 --> 01:21:59.541
All she's done
these last 10 months

01:21:59.749 --> 01:22:01.585
is to wander
around Europe

01:22:01.793 --> 01:22:03.461
revisiting places
she's been with Beau.

01:22:03.670 --> 01:22:06.381
8 times she's climbed
that lousy Matterhorn

01:22:06.631 --> 01:22:08.383
to throw Rose petals
down the glacier.

01:22:08.592 --> 01:22:10.844
I should have gone to the boat
with Patrick to meet her.

01:22:11.052 --> 01:22:13.722
I haven't seen her
since the funeral.

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:15.390
Wasn't it like Mame

01:22:15.599 --> 01:22:17.267
to keep him
till I got there?

01:22:17.475 --> 01:22:20.228
Listen, you cynic!
She was in love with him!

01:22:20.437 --> 01:22:22.230
She's changed,
I tell you.

01:22:22.606 --> 01:22:23.440
Uh-huh!

01:22:23.648 --> 01:22:25.275
I'll get some champagne.

01:22:27.027 --> 01:22:28.612
Oh, I'll answer it.

01:22:35.452 --> 01:22:36.870
Mame!

01:22:38.747 --> 01:22:40.749
Zooks, she can't
have changed that much!

01:22:41.458 --> 01:22:42.250
I'm from speed-o.

01:22:42.626 --> 01:22:43.752
You're what?

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:44.961
Patrick called

01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:45.879
a secretarial
service.

01:22:46.087 --> 01:22:47.255
Your name is,
uh...

01:22:47.631 --> 01:22:48.465
Agnes Gooch.

01:22:48.673 --> 01:22:49.716
Now, Miss Gooch,

01:22:49.925 --> 01:22:50.884
you'll be
taking dictation

01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:52.260
from
Mrs. Burnside.

01:22:52.469 --> 01:22:54.387
She's a very
fast talker.

01:22:54.638 --> 01:22:56.431
Speed-o
won't let anybody out

01:22:56.681 --> 01:22:58.934
who can't do at least
180 words a minute.

01:22:59.309 --> 01:23:00.143
I'm over 200.

01:23:00.352 --> 01:23:01.645
Oh, you're not!

01:23:01.853 --> 01:23:03.521
She may let loose
with a million words

01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:04.981
and ideas.

01:23:05.190 --> 01:23:06.775
I want you
to be right there

01:23:06.983 --> 01:23:09.152
to soak them up
like a sponge.

01:23:09.402 --> 01:23:12.739
Speed-o better have symbols
for 4-letter words.

01:23:12.948 --> 01:23:14.783
Oh, Lindsay, Mame
will never write a book!

01:23:15.033 --> 01:23:16.660
Patrick's
got someone to help.

01:23:16.868 --> 01:23:18.119
Great Scott, I forgot.

01:23:18.370 --> 01:23:19.996
He told the fellow
to be here at 3:00.

01:23:20.205 --> 01:23:21.039
What fellow?

01:23:27.754 --> 01:23:28.797
That's the signal.

01:23:29.005 --> 01:23:30.340
What signal?

01:23:30.548 --> 01:23:32.968
Patrick wants us
to surprise Mame.

01:23:33.176 --> 01:23:34.636
Hide! In there.
Quick!

01:23:34.844 --> 01:23:36.388
I--

01:23:38.848 --> 01:23:40.934
you, too,
Miss Gooch.

01:23:43.645 --> 01:23:46.314
Why are you ringing?
Don't you have a key?

01:23:46.523 --> 01:23:47.774
Oh, of course!

01:23:48.024 --> 01:23:48.692
What am I
thinking of?

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.360
Oh, Patrick!

01:23:52.195 --> 01:23:53.446
Ah!

01:23:54.698 --> 01:23:56.658
Welcome home,
Auntie Mame.

01:23:56.866 --> 01:23:58.827
Oh, good old
Beekman Place.

01:23:59.035 --> 01:24:00.370
Always so loyal.

01:24:00.578 --> 01:24:04.457
No matter how far I go,
it waits for me to come back.

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:06.251
I do hope you
used it weekends.

01:24:06.459 --> 01:24:08.378
Well, no, I didn't.
I usually go from school

01:24:08.586 --> 01:24:10.255
out to Connecticut
to uncle Dwight's.

01:24:10.463 --> 01:24:11.923
Oh.

01:24:12.132 --> 01:24:15.051
I rather expected Vera
to be at the boat.

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:16.511
I wouldn't
let her come.

01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:18.304
I wanted to be
all alone with you.

01:24:18.513 --> 01:24:20.056
Oh, Patrick!

01:24:20.265 --> 01:24:22.350
My little Patrick!

01:24:22.726 --> 01:24:25.395
Oh, now, now, now.
Open your presents.

01:24:25.603 --> 01:24:27.355
I just can't
get over it.

01:24:27.564 --> 01:24:29.024
Every time I see you,

01:24:29.232 --> 01:24:31.526
you're taller
and more grownup.

01:24:31.776 --> 01:24:33.528
Golly! Short pants!
At last!

01:24:33.737 --> 01:24:36.531
Can I try them on
right now?

01:24:36.781 --> 01:24:38.533
Ha ha! Right now!

01:24:38.742 --> 01:24:42.203
Surprise!
Welcome home, Mame!

01:24:43.455 --> 01:24:45.331
Vera!

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:51.004
And dear, staunch,
stalwart Lindsay.

01:24:51.212 --> 01:24:53.548
Oh, how good
of you both

01:24:53.757 --> 01:24:56.551
to rally round
this bereft old woman.

01:24:56.801 --> 01:24:58.053
Doesn't she
look great?

01:24:58.261 --> 01:24:59.512
How can you tell?

01:24:59.763 --> 01:25:01.181
Mame, couldn't you
have gone

01:25:01.431 --> 01:25:03.058
to purple by now?

01:25:03.266 --> 01:25:05.435
Come on, Auntie Mame.
Champagne!

01:25:05.643 --> 01:25:06.978
And fishberry jam.

01:25:07.187 --> 01:25:08.563
No, no, Patrick.

01:25:08.772 --> 01:25:11.566
The bubbles no longer
tickle my nose.

01:25:11.816 --> 01:25:14.527
I've given up alcohol,
along with everything else.

01:25:14.778 --> 01:25:17.405
It's wonderful
of you all, very touching,

01:25:17.781 --> 01:25:19.532
but...what's that?

01:25:19.783 --> 01:25:22.118
That's your dictaphone
and your typewriter.

01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:25.455
And what's that?

01:25:25.663 --> 01:25:27.415
I'm your sponge!

01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:29.751
Auntie Mame,
this is your secretary.

01:25:29.959 --> 01:25:31.211
My secretary?

01:25:31.461 --> 01:25:33.421
Yes. You're
going to write

01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:34.756
your autobiography.

01:25:34.964 --> 01:25:36.216
Me write a book?

01:25:36.466 --> 01:25:38.593
No one's had a more
colorful life than you.

01:25:38.802 --> 01:25:40.345
Think of all
the fascinating people

01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:41.930
you've known--
Winston Churchill,

01:25:42.138 --> 01:25:43.014
Mahatma Gandhi, me...

01:25:43.223 --> 01:25:44.099
And I've saved
all your letters.

01:25:44.474 --> 01:25:46.226
You'll be so busy
digging up the past,

01:25:46.476 --> 01:25:48.645
you won't have time
to think about the present.

01:25:48.853 --> 01:25:50.188
And I promise
to publish it.

01:25:50.396 --> 01:25:52.816
I see...This is
some sort of conspiracy.

01:25:53.024 --> 01:25:54.025
No, no.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.069
Yes, yes, some trumped-up
occupational therapy,

01:25:56.277 --> 01:25:58.113
like leathercraft
or basket-weaving.

01:25:58.321 --> 01:25:59.781
I swear it'll be
a best seller.

01:25:59.989 --> 01:26:00.615
A best seller?

01:26:00.824 --> 01:26:02.450
And you'd be doing
me a favor.

01:26:02.826 --> 01:26:04.452
My memoirs? My memoirs.

01:26:04.661 --> 01:26:06.246
Patrick,
you forgot my drink.

01:26:06.496 --> 01:26:07.288
Champagne?

01:26:07.497 --> 01:26:09.332
Anything, darling.
Just make it double.

01:26:09.582 --> 01:26:10.625
I see it
in 2 volumes,

01:26:10.834 --> 01:26:12.043
boxed like Proust.

01:26:12.252 --> 01:26:13.419
Well, uh...

01:26:13.628 --> 01:26:16.089
Let me see...
Chapter one, page one.

01:26:16.297 --> 01:26:18.633
She supposed to
start this minute?

01:26:18.842 --> 01:26:20.510
Oh, this isn't
so difficult.

01:26:20.718 --> 01:26:22.053
Patrick,
get me another drink.

01:26:22.262 --> 01:26:25.181
Where was I?
Chapter one, page one.

01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:26.641
What are you writing?

01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:29.602
"Chapter one, page one.
This isn't so difficult.

01:26:29.853 --> 01:26:31.104
"Patrick,
get me another drink.

01:26:31.312 --> 01:26:33.481
Where was I?
What are you writing?"

01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:35.316
She is fast.

01:26:35.525 --> 01:26:37.277
Atta-girl, Auntie Mame.
You're off and running.

01:26:37.485 --> 01:26:39.154
Patrick, do you think
I should do this?

01:26:39.529 --> 01:26:40.655
It'll take up all my time,

01:26:40.864 --> 01:26:42.782
and I came home
just to be with you.

01:26:42.991 --> 01:26:44.909
You can't exactly
be with me.

01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:46.411
No women in the dorm.

01:26:46.619 --> 01:26:48.746
I keep forgetting, darling.
You're all grown up now.

01:26:48.955 --> 01:26:51.291
You don't need me anymore.
Nobody needs me anymore.

01:26:51.541 --> 01:26:53.334
It's one of the saddest
things that--

01:26:53.585 --> 01:26:55.378
how do you turn her off?
Now where was I?

01:26:55.587 --> 01:26:58.173
The most important thing
is a very good beginning.

01:26:58.381 --> 01:27:01.301
Why don't you wait
for your collaborator?

01:27:01.509 --> 01:27:02.343
Collaborator?

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.637
A friend arranged
for an editor

01:27:04.888 --> 01:27:06.306
to work with you,

01:27:06.556 --> 01:27:07.640
a fellow named O'Banion.

01:27:09.642 --> 01:27:11.394
You don't trust me
to write my own life?

01:27:11.603 --> 01:27:13.354
Good heavens,
who else could write it?

01:27:13.605 --> 01:27:14.856
He wants to give me
a ghost!

01:27:15.064 --> 01:27:16.316
Not a ghost, Mame!

01:27:16.566 --> 01:27:18.359
I see the whole picture.
A ghostwriter!

01:27:18.610 --> 01:27:19.903
If you think
I'll expose my life

01:27:20.153 --> 01:27:22.238
in front of some burly,
beer-drinking Irishman,

01:27:22.447 --> 01:27:23.781
who leads a low,
common life

01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:25.533
in some
3rd Avenue bar,

01:27:25.742 --> 01:27:27.368
you're very much mistaken.
A ghostwriter!

01:27:27.577 --> 01:27:30.163
You don't trust me
to write my own life!

01:27:30.371 --> 01:27:31.497
Auntie Mame--

01:27:31.748 --> 01:27:32.916
whoever
this creature is--

01:27:33.124 --> 01:27:34.834
a Mr. O'Banion
to see you.

01:27:37.837 --> 01:27:41.132
I was asked to drop by to meet
the fabulous Mrs. Burnside.

01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:47.388
Ahh...you are she,
of course.

01:27:47.597 --> 01:27:50.391
I could sense the aura

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:53.561
of creative vitality
about you.

01:28:02.362 --> 01:28:05.740
Won't you come in,
Mr. O'Banion?

01:28:12.372 --> 01:28:15.500
I thought by way
of introduction, Mrs. Burnside,

01:28:15.708 --> 01:28:19.545
I'd present you with this slim
volume of me poems,

01:28:19.754 --> 01:28:21.381
<i>The Parched Garden.</i>

01:28:21.631 --> 01:28:23.925
What a lovely title.
Thank you.

01:28:24.133 --> 01:28:25.760
Do you mind
if I sit down?

01:28:25.969 --> 01:28:28.638
That long ride up
in the elevator,

01:28:28.846 --> 01:28:30.723
it's after
getting me dizzy.

01:28:30.932 --> 01:28:32.225
I'll be after
getting you

01:28:32.433 --> 01:28:33.768
a bit of water.

01:28:33.977 --> 01:28:35.561
Oh, no, no.
Please don't bother.

01:28:35.770 --> 01:28:39.691
Of course, a bit of champagne
if it's handy.

01:28:39.899 --> 01:28:40.942
Patrick.

01:28:41.317 --> 01:28:43.611
It seems to help.

01:28:48.116 --> 01:28:49.117
Thank you.

01:28:49.325 --> 01:28:50.868
Uh, oh...

01:28:51.244 --> 01:28:52.870
It's the other one.

01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:59.711
Tell me,
how did it happen?

01:29:00.878 --> 01:29:04.048
Well, it was in 1922,
the great rebellion.

01:29:05.758 --> 01:29:08.678
Even a lad of 15
can feel strongly

01:29:08.886 --> 01:29:11.806
about his country's
independence.

01:29:12.015 --> 01:29:12.807
Tch, tch, tch.

01:29:13.016 --> 01:29:14.767
Ahem!

01:29:16.769 --> 01:29:18.104
Oh.

01:29:18.354 --> 01:29:19.731
How nice.

01:29:22.942 --> 01:29:24.652
Tell me,
Mr. O'Banion,

01:29:24.861 --> 01:29:26.154
do you think
you and I

01:29:26.362 --> 01:29:28.072
can ever get
anyplace?

01:29:31.284 --> 01:29:32.493
With the book,
I mean.

01:29:33.036 --> 01:29:35.330
Well, we've both
known sorrow.

01:29:37.123 --> 01:29:38.374
I feel that you and I

01:29:38.583 --> 01:29:40.877
are going to
create something...

01:29:42.253 --> 01:29:43.421
Something beautiful.

01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:45.423
♪♪ Too-ra-loo-ra-lay ♪♪

01:29:45.631 --> 01:29:47.050
♪♪ A-loo-ra-lay ♪♪

01:29:47.258 --> 01:29:51.888
♪♪ A-too-ra-loo-ra-lay ♪♪♪♪

01:29:58.853 --> 01:30:00.730
Actually, my childhood
was so sad.

01:30:00.938 --> 01:30:02.815
Looking back,
mother died in childbirth.

01:30:03.066 --> 01:30:04.692
That was a dreadful thing.

01:30:04.942 --> 01:30:06.277
Father traveled
all the time.

01:30:06.486 --> 01:30:08.154
What a difficult man
he was.

01:30:08.363 --> 01:30:10.406
I must be fair to father.
I really must.

01:30:10.615 --> 01:30:12.867
Remind me to do a whole
new chapter about him.

01:30:13.076 --> 01:30:14.035
No, take that out.

01:30:14.243 --> 01:30:16.913
I don't think I'll be
bothered with that.

01:30:18.623 --> 01:30:20.416
I had to start working
when I was 8.

01:30:20.625 --> 01:30:21.959
8 years of age!

01:30:22.168 --> 01:30:23.836
I went over to
this woman next door

01:30:24.045 --> 01:30:26.381
and said, "can I baby-sit?
Can I do something?"

01:30:26.631 --> 01:30:28.633
I said to myself,
"I must have clothes,

01:30:28.841 --> 01:30:31.594
I must have parties,
I must have pretties."

01:30:54.367 --> 01:30:55.618
Please.

01:30:56.369 --> 01:30:58.329
Please, Miss Gooch!

01:31:00.331 --> 01:31:02.125
How can I court the muse

01:31:02.333 --> 01:31:04.001
with all that
clackety-clack?

01:31:04.210 --> 01:31:07.130
Oh, I'm sorry,
Mr. O'Banion.

01:31:07.338 --> 01:31:10.133
I'm only taking off what
Mrs. Burnside dictated.

01:31:10.383 --> 01:31:12.927
Everything
Mrs. Burnside dictates

01:31:13.136 --> 01:31:14.595
is so wonderful.

01:31:14.804 --> 01:31:18.099
When I think of
the things she's done,

01:31:18.349 --> 01:31:21.644
and think of the things
I haven't done,

01:31:21.853 --> 01:31:23.688
I could just die.

01:31:23.896 --> 01:31:26.649
It's so exciting
being in this house.

01:31:26.858 --> 01:31:29.026
Just imagine,
a Japanese houseboy,

01:31:29.235 --> 01:31:31.654
all those
artistic friends,

01:31:31.863 --> 01:31:34.615
and you,
Mr. O'Banion.

01:31:36.367 --> 01:31:38.119
Oh, I'll get it,
Brian.

01:31:38.369 --> 01:31:39.620
Hello.

01:31:39.829 --> 01:31:41.497
Oh, hello, Lindsay.

01:31:42.248 --> 01:31:43.875
Oh, it's coming along.

01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:46.002
Well, it's only been
3 months.

01:31:46.377 --> 01:31:49.046
Brian is polishing
and perfecting it.

01:31:49.255 --> 01:31:51.757
A party! Oh, I'd--

01:31:53.176 --> 01:31:54.635
oh...no,
I'm afraid not.

01:31:54.844 --> 01:31:56.679
Brian couldn't possibly--

01:31:56.888 --> 01:31:58.514
what is it, my dear?

01:31:58.764 --> 01:32:00.016
Lindsay feels
that Warner brothers

01:32:00.224 --> 01:32:01.476
might pay a fortune
for our book

01:32:01.726 --> 01:32:03.060
as a vehicle
for Bette Davis.

01:32:03.269 --> 01:32:05.521
Jack Warner's coming
to his apartment tonight,

01:32:05.730 --> 01:32:06.856
but I said you wouldn't--

01:32:07.106 --> 01:32:09.358
Lindsay! Lindsay...

01:32:09.734 --> 01:32:12.361
Mrs. Burnside
and I couldn't possibly

01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:16.449
allow our work to be
defiled by a movie company,

01:32:16.657 --> 01:32:18.868
but just as a courtesy,

01:32:19.076 --> 01:32:20.870
we'll come and discuss it.

01:32:22.330 --> 01:32:23.873
Uh, about 8:30.

01:32:24.081 --> 01:32:25.374
Black tie?

01:32:25.583 --> 01:32:27.418
All right, and thank you
very much.

01:32:27.627 --> 01:32:28.920
Good-bye.

01:32:29.128 --> 01:32:30.546
Brian, you accepted.

01:32:30.755 --> 01:32:32.089
It might do you good

01:32:32.298 --> 01:32:34.383
to get back in the world
for a change tonight.

01:32:34.759 --> 01:32:37.094
Here's what you
dictated, Mrs. Burnside.

01:32:37.303 --> 01:32:38.554
Oh, thank you.

01:32:38.804 --> 01:32:41.516
Here's what
Mr. O'Banion edited.

01:32:41.724 --> 01:32:45.520
Oh. Well, Mr. O'Banion
and I are going to work now.

01:32:45.728 --> 01:32:47.563
Why don't you do...

01:32:47.772 --> 01:32:50.066
Whatever it is
you do do to relax?

01:32:50.274 --> 01:32:51.901
Thank you,
Mrs. Burnside.

01:32:52.151 --> 01:32:55.905
I think I'll just
fix myself a Dr. pepper.

01:33:01.369 --> 01:33:02.578
Brian, I'm really
worried.

01:33:02.787 --> 01:33:04.705
We have so little
to show Mr. Warner.

01:33:04.914 --> 01:33:06.374
We'll have to
tell him the story.

01:33:06.582 --> 01:33:07.750
How long
will it take us

01:33:07.959 --> 01:33:09.085
to finish this book?

01:33:09.293 --> 01:33:11.671
Flaubert spent 13 years
on <i>Madame Bovary.</i>

01:33:13.422 --> 01:33:15.091
Oh...
uh--w-where were we?

01:33:15.299 --> 01:33:17.134
Give us our last
sentence again.

01:33:17.343 --> 01:33:19.595
"My puberty in buffalo
was drab."

01:33:19.804 --> 01:33:22.139
No, no, no.
It has no majesty.

01:33:22.348 --> 01:33:25.476
Drab is such
a <i>drab</i> word.

01:33:25.685 --> 01:33:26.769
How right you are.

01:33:26.978 --> 01:33:29.021
It has
no afflatus!

01:33:30.982 --> 01:33:33.317
What about bleak?

01:33:33.526 --> 01:33:35.027
Bleak?

01:33:35.236 --> 01:33:37.488
Bleak! "How bleak
was my puberty."

01:33:37.697 --> 01:33:39.031
Bleak, buffalo.

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:41.576
Hear how the 2 words
cling to each other,

01:33:41.826 --> 01:33:43.619
locked together
like a man and woman

01:33:43.869 --> 01:33:45.121
in each other's
arms.

01:33:45.329 --> 01:33:46.706
Listen to
the words sing!

01:33:46.914 --> 01:33:49.709
"How bleak
was my puberty!"

01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:54.046
I'm sorry.

01:33:54.255 --> 01:33:55.631
Come, Mame, come.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.051
Let us lie down here
in front of the fire

01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:00.636
and stare at the flames.

01:34:00.845 --> 01:34:04.473
It will help stir
the flames of our inspiration.

01:34:04.849 --> 01:34:06.601
Uh, y-yes--yes...
Well, now, Brian.

01:34:06.851 --> 01:34:08.561
Do you think
the general public

01:34:08.853 --> 01:34:10.646
will understand
all this symbolism?

01:34:10.855 --> 01:34:12.523
"Like an echo
from the caves

01:34:12.732 --> 01:34:14.483
"of Glocca Morra,
I came forth,

01:34:14.859 --> 01:34:17.528
whilst Deidre
wept cool tears."

01:34:17.737 --> 01:34:20.156
Wouldn't it be
simpler to say,

01:34:20.364 --> 01:34:22.199
"on the day
I was born,

01:34:22.408 --> 01:34:24.201
it rained
in buffalo"?

01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:25.745
But it's drab.

01:34:25.953 --> 01:34:27.747
It's drab,
but it's clear!

01:34:28.122 --> 01:34:29.498
Here is clarity, Mame.

01:34:29.874 --> 01:34:32.543
I stayed awake to sift it
from obscurity.

01:34:32.752 --> 01:34:36.005
"In the blank, gray, midnight
of me haunted garden,

01:34:36.213 --> 01:34:39.759
"your soft form appeared,
raining kisses

01:34:40.009 --> 01:34:41.636
on the parched earth
of me lips."

01:34:41.886 --> 01:34:43.137
Brian, what's
come over you?

01:34:43.346 --> 01:34:44.347
Now,
you mustn't!

01:34:44.555 --> 01:34:46.641
It takes Agnes
no time at all

01:34:46.891 --> 01:34:48.059
to knock off
a Dr. pepper.

01:34:48.309 --> 01:34:50.686
- Brian, you mustn't!
- Mame.

01:34:50.895 --> 01:34:53.147
Do not withdraw
this wondrous watering,

01:34:53.356 --> 01:34:54.523
for without you--

01:34:54.899 --> 01:34:57.234
I rinsed out
the glass.

01:34:57.443 --> 01:34:59.362
Aren't you neat,
ag--

01:35:01.822 --> 01:35:04.533
Mame, it came from
the very fiber of me being.

01:35:04.909 --> 01:35:06.661
That's why
I was so tired today.

01:35:06.911 --> 01:35:08.704
It took everything
out of me.

01:35:08.954 --> 01:35:12.375
You could revitalize me
with a single motherly kiss.

01:35:12.583 --> 01:35:15.711
Mmm!

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.588
Brian, what's
happened to you?

01:35:17.797 --> 01:35:19.131
I'm revitalized!

01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.716
Revitalized?
You're recharged!

01:35:20.925 --> 01:35:22.635
Don't you dare
come near me! Stay there!

01:35:22.843 --> 01:35:24.553
You're old enough
to be my mother!

01:35:24.929 --> 01:35:27.598
I'm going to your room--
I mean my room! Norah, Ito!

01:35:27.807 --> 01:35:29.850
Aaah! Your leg!
You'll kill yourself!

01:35:30.059 --> 01:35:32.269
But what a way to die!
I'm mad for you!

01:35:32.478 --> 01:35:35.398
For 2 months, you've poured
your strength into me.

01:35:35.648 --> 01:35:37.233
Now I will pour it
right back!

01:35:37.441 --> 01:35:39.402
Aah!

01:35:40.695 --> 01:35:42.613
Brian! Brian,
this is ridiculous!

01:35:42.822 --> 01:35:44.281
It's like
having a crush

01:35:44.490 --> 01:35:46.492
on your
schoolteacher

01:35:46.742 --> 01:35:48.202
or your analyst!

01:35:48.411 --> 01:35:50.246
Oh, now, stop it!
Stop!

01:35:50.454 --> 01:35:51.706
Hello, anybody!

01:35:51.914 --> 01:35:54.291
Patrick!

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.918
Hello, Auntie Mame.

01:35:58.295 --> 01:35:59.422
Hello, Dennis.

01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:01.966
I'm so glad to see you,
darling.

01:36:02.216 --> 01:36:03.300
Mrs. Burnside and I

01:36:03.509 --> 01:36:05.803
were just working...
On the book.

01:36:06.011 --> 01:36:08.222
I bet that's going to
be some book.

01:36:08.431 --> 01:36:10.266
What are you doing
home from school?

01:36:10.474 --> 01:36:12.351
I had to talk
to you about something.

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:14.186
You have things
to talk about.

01:36:14.395 --> 01:36:16.272
I'll go up to
my room and change.

01:36:19.233 --> 01:36:20.943
His room?
Is he living here?

01:36:21.152 --> 01:36:22.403
Well, of course,
darling.

01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:24.864
He was living in some
miserable cold-water flat,

01:36:25.072 --> 01:36:28.242
and since we're working together
literally night and day...

01:36:28.451 --> 01:36:30.995
Let me tell you something about
that spiritual Irish poet--

01:36:31.203 --> 01:36:33.414
you don't have to
tell me a thing.

01:36:33.622 --> 01:36:35.875
It looks very cozy.

01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:38.252
For a minute there,
you sounded exactly like

01:36:38.461 --> 01:36:40.629
somebody from
the Knickerbocker bank.

01:36:40.838 --> 01:36:43.424
Please get O'Banion
out of here right away.

01:36:43.674 --> 01:36:45.676
I beg your pardon.

01:36:45.885 --> 01:36:47.678
I don't want him
in this house.

01:36:47.887 --> 01:36:51.140
Aren't you taking rather
an imperious tone?

01:36:51.348 --> 01:36:53.434
Mr. O'Banion
is my colleague.

01:36:53.684 --> 01:36:54.935
Colleague, my foot!

01:36:55.144 --> 01:36:56.979
Gloria would never
understand that you--

01:36:57.188 --> 01:37:00.191
now, who is Gloria?

01:37:00.399 --> 01:37:02.693
Auntie Mame,
listen to me.

01:37:02.902 --> 01:37:04.236
I've met a girl.

01:37:04.445 --> 01:37:05.696
I've been
going with her

01:37:05.905 --> 01:37:07.698
for several months.

01:37:07.907 --> 01:37:09.033
Oh.

01:37:09.241 --> 01:37:11.160
She's a very
special girl and...

01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:14.497
I guess
I should have

01:37:14.705 --> 01:37:16.999
told you about her
before.

01:37:17.208 --> 01:37:18.375
I would have,

01:37:18.584 --> 01:37:20.878
but you were tied up
with the book and...

01:37:21.086 --> 01:37:22.713
Everything.

01:37:22.922 --> 01:37:25.132
Until now it wasn't
really definite.

01:37:25.341 --> 01:37:26.884
What's definite now?

01:37:27.092 --> 01:37:30.679
Gloria's <i>the</i> girl!
That's what's definite!

01:37:30.888 --> 01:37:32.848
And you're going to
meet her...Tonight.

01:37:33.057 --> 01:37:35.351
I hope you didn't leave her
sitting in the car!

01:37:35.559 --> 01:37:37.436
No, I dropped her off
at her girlfriend's,

01:37:37.645 --> 01:37:38.979
Bunny Bixler's
on park Avenue.

01:37:39.188 --> 01:37:40.523
She wanted to spruce up
before she met you.

01:37:40.773 --> 01:37:42.358
I'd better do some
sprucing up of my own.

01:37:42.566 --> 01:37:43.859
I'll bring her back
in 10 or 15 minutes.

01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:45.903
I'll have my face
all organized.

01:37:46.111 --> 01:37:48.864
Mame, where are
me evening slippers?

01:37:49.114 --> 01:37:50.866
Oh, it's all right.
I found them.

01:37:51.075 --> 01:37:52.618
Wait a minute.

01:37:54.703 --> 01:37:56.580
If he's still
in the house,

01:37:57.373 --> 01:37:59.250
I'm not gonna bring
Gloria back here.

01:38:00.584 --> 01:38:02.628
May I inquire why?

01:38:03.838 --> 01:38:06.131
Gloria's a very sensitive
and well-brought-up girl.

01:38:08.008 --> 01:38:09.218
I don't want you
flaunting

01:38:09.426 --> 01:38:11.971
your new flames
and old peccadilloes

01:38:12.179 --> 01:38:13.305
in front of her.

01:38:15.432 --> 01:38:17.726
Then why bring her
here at all?

01:38:18.978 --> 01:38:20.312
You want to know
the truth?

01:38:20.521 --> 01:38:22.231
I've been trying to
avoid it.

01:38:22.690 --> 01:38:24.567
She wanted to meet you.

01:38:26.026 --> 01:38:27.152
I see.

01:38:28.112 --> 01:38:29.321
So you just dropped by

01:38:29.530 --> 01:38:32.449
to see that I was all...
Scrubbed up,

01:38:32.658 --> 01:38:33.909
presentable
for inspection,

01:38:34.159 --> 01:38:35.202
is that it?

01:38:35.452 --> 01:38:36.245
Yes.

01:38:36.453 --> 01:38:39.290
And to tell you
that while I've got

01:38:39.498 --> 01:38:40.583
my girl here tonight,

01:38:40.833 --> 01:38:42.626
for 5 minutes
try to act like

01:38:42.835 --> 01:38:44.461
a normal human being.

01:38:44.670 --> 01:38:46.589
Gloria's from a very
conservative family,

01:38:46.797 --> 01:38:47.798
good stock, and...

01:38:48.007 --> 01:38:50.217
She doesn't have to know
about a lot of things

01:38:50.426 --> 01:38:53.345
that ordinary mortals simply
don't have to know about.

01:38:57.516 --> 01:38:59.268
Should she know
that I think

01:38:59.476 --> 01:39:01.020
you've turned into
one of the most

01:39:01.228 --> 01:39:03.564
beastly, bourgeois,
babbitty little snobs

01:39:03.814 --> 01:39:05.524
on the eastern
seaboard...

01:39:10.487 --> 01:39:12.948
Or will you be able
to make that quite clear

01:39:13.157 --> 01:39:15.242
without any help
from me?

01:39:20.289 --> 01:39:22.583
Well, it's been
nice knowing you.

01:39:25.127 --> 01:39:26.795
Patrick.

01:39:27.630 --> 01:39:28.964
Auntie Mame.

01:39:31.342 --> 01:39:34.845
Oh, darling,
oh, I love you so.

01:39:35.054 --> 01:39:36.221
I'd do anything for you.

01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:38.390
I'd join the D.A.R.,

01:39:38.641 --> 01:39:39.558
I'd denounce
Calvin Coolidge

01:39:39.767 --> 01:39:41.060
as a bolshevik!

01:39:41.268 --> 01:39:42.645
Oh, Auntie Mame,

01:39:42.853 --> 01:39:44.313
Gloria had better
like you,

01:39:44.521 --> 01:39:46.190
or I'll belt her one
square in the chops.

01:39:46.398 --> 01:39:47.983
I'll have him out
of here in no time,

01:39:48.192 --> 01:39:49.401
have the whole place
fumigated.

01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:51.070
I promise, darling.
I promise!

01:40:04.208 --> 01:40:05.834
Thanks, Auntie Mame.

We can't keep
Lindsay waiting.

01:40:37.032 --> 01:40:38.742
Brian, would you mind awfully
going to the party

01:40:38.951 --> 01:40:40.119
without me tonight?

01:40:40.369 --> 01:40:41.996
You want me to go alone?
I wouldn't think of it.

01:40:42.246 --> 01:40:43.205
Something just came up--

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:44.707
hurry up
and get dressed.

01:40:44.915 --> 01:40:46.792
I am not going
to that party alone.

01:41:04.935 --> 01:41:07.813
If there's nothing more
you wanted, Mrs. Burnside,

01:41:08.022 --> 01:41:10.941
I just thought
I'd go up to my room.

01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:17.573
Agnes.

01:41:19.783 --> 01:41:23.078
Agnes.

01:41:24.371 --> 01:41:27.041
I wonder.

01:41:27.291 --> 01:41:29.501
Is anything wrong,
Mrs. Burnside?

01:41:29.710 --> 01:41:31.170
Agnes.

01:41:33.839 --> 01:41:35.382
You're coming out.

01:41:35.591 --> 01:41:37.051
Where?

01:41:37.301 --> 01:41:39.511
You know, you have
very beautiful eyes.

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:42.598
Take these glasses off
and leave them off forever.

01:41:42.806 --> 01:41:45.392
I can't see anything
out of my right eye.

01:41:45.642 --> 01:41:47.436
Look out of your left one.
Now, now, now, now!

01:41:47.686 --> 01:41:51.106
You do have a bust!

01:41:51.315 --> 01:41:54.443
Where have you been
hiding that all these months?

01:41:54.651 --> 01:41:55.986
Mrs. Burnside!

01:41:56.236 --> 01:41:57.071
What do you call
those things?

01:41:57.321 --> 01:41:59.114
Orthopedic Oxfords.

01:41:59.364 --> 01:42:01.325
Kick them off.
Take off your clothes.

01:42:01.533 --> 01:42:02.576
Norah, Ito.

01:42:02.785 --> 01:42:04.495
There's a man
in the house.

01:42:04.703 --> 01:42:07.081
Agnes, stop being a goof.
Get these clothes off quickly!

01:42:07.331 --> 01:42:08.290
I'm in a hurry!

01:42:08.665 --> 01:42:09.708
Norah! Ito!

01:42:09.917 --> 01:42:11.877
Where are you
when I need you?

01:42:12.127 --> 01:42:14.338
Mrs. Burnside, I don't
have a very clear picture

01:42:14.588 --> 01:42:16.215
of what's going on.

01:42:16.423 --> 01:42:17.591
Oh...

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:19.343
Now, Agnes, dear,

01:42:19.551 --> 01:42:22.054
I am sending you
to that party tonight

01:42:22.262 --> 01:42:23.597
with Mr. O'Banion.

01:42:23.806 --> 01:42:25.599
Oh, I couldn't.

01:42:25.849 --> 01:42:27.476
I'm too nervous.

01:42:27.726 --> 01:42:30.854
Oh! This will
calm you down.

01:42:31.063 --> 01:42:32.898
Oh, no! Spirits do

01:42:33.107 --> 01:42:35.234
the most terrible
things to me.

01:42:35.484 --> 01:42:37.402
I'm not the same girl.

01:42:37.694 --> 01:42:39.363
What's wrong with that?

01:42:39.613 --> 01:42:41.490
Will it mix
with Dr. pepper?

01:42:41.698 --> 01:42:43.784
He'll love it.
Drink!

01:42:45.452 --> 01:42:47.830
Oh, Norah, go upstairs
and get my black velvet.

01:42:48.038 --> 01:42:49.581
Ito, lay out
all my cosmetics--

01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:51.416
cold cream, eye shadow,
eyebrow pencils!

01:42:51.625 --> 01:42:52.835
Everything!

01:42:53.043 --> 01:42:54.628
You see, me be
Charlie of the Ritz.

01:42:54.837 --> 01:42:56.255
Ha ha ha!

01:42:56.463 --> 01:42:58.132
Come, child.

01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:01.260
I think I know
what you want me to do.

01:43:01.468 --> 01:43:03.762
I'm not a bit sure
I want to do it.

01:43:03.971 --> 01:43:05.848
Agnes, where is
your spine?

01:43:06.098 --> 01:43:08.058
Here you've been taking
my dictation for weeks,

01:43:08.267 --> 01:43:10.018
and you don't get
the message of my book.

01:43:10.394 --> 01:43:11.395
Live!
that's the message!

01:43:11.603 --> 01:43:12.729
Live?

01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:14.481
Yes!
Life is a banquet,

01:43:14.690 --> 01:43:16.358
and most poor suckers
are starving to death!

01:43:16.567 --> 01:43:17.734
Now, come on, Agnes,
live!

01:43:17.943 --> 01:43:18.819
Live!

01:43:19.027 --> 01:43:20.279
Come, child! Live!

01:43:20.529 --> 01:43:22.156
- Live!
- Live!

01:43:22.406 --> 01:43:24.616
Live!

01:43:26.952 --> 01:43:29.788
Ha ha ha!

01:43:31.165 --> 01:43:32.749
The whole place
has gone nuts.

01:43:32.958 --> 01:43:34.668
She'll never make
a silk purse

01:43:34.877 --> 01:43:36.420
out of <i>that</i> sow's ear.

01:43:39.756 --> 01:43:42.342
Oh, Mrs. Burnside,
I can't breathe!

01:43:42.593 --> 01:43:43.844
Oh, good, good.

01:43:44.052 --> 01:43:46.930
If you can breathe,
it isn't tight enough.

01:43:49.474 --> 01:43:50.726
And why aren't
you dressed?

01:43:50.934 --> 01:43:52.561
Brian, you just have to
understand--

01:43:52.811 --> 01:43:54.229
I'm not going
to that party tonight.

01:43:54.479 --> 01:43:56.315
Then I'm not going either.

01:43:56.523 --> 01:43:58.192
I'm not! I'm not!
I'm not!

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:02.988
Well, you can use
the Duesenberg.

01:44:04.448 --> 01:44:07.993
And I have a date
for you.

01:44:09.369 --> 01:44:11.330
Oh, Agnes!

01:44:11.538 --> 01:44:12.873
Agnes!

01:44:13.081 --> 01:44:14.416
You can't expect--

01:44:14.625 --> 01:44:17.878
would you ask Toscanini
to lead a harmonica band?

01:44:18.086 --> 01:44:19.087
Now, Brian.

01:44:19.296 --> 01:44:20.380
I won't take Gooch.

01:44:20.589 --> 01:44:22.049
She's an offense
to the human eyesight.

01:44:22.257 --> 01:44:23.342
It's a good thing
her mother,

01:44:23.717 --> 01:44:25.552
the Countess de Gooch,
can't hear that.

01:44:25.802 --> 01:44:28.138
She'd...eh...
pull your beard.

01:44:28.347 --> 01:44:30.807
Countess?
you're joking.

01:44:31.058 --> 01:44:33.185
Surely you've heard
of the de Gooches?

01:44:33.393 --> 01:44:34.811
Second wealthiest
banking family

01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:36.313
in the country.

01:44:36.521 --> 01:44:38.732
Fabulous estate
at Newport.

01:44:38.941 --> 01:44:40.776
This child
is just doing this

01:44:40.984 --> 01:44:42.986
for a little
literary experience.

01:44:43.195 --> 01:44:45.739
Ah, Agnes.

01:44:45.989 --> 01:44:47.366
No, no, no.

01:44:47.574 --> 01:44:48.992
Head up, dear.

01:44:49.201 --> 01:44:52.246
Shoulders back,
tummy in.

01:44:52.496 --> 01:44:55.582
Oh, Agnes, tonight
you are queen of Romania.

01:45:04.883 --> 01:45:07.094
Oh, Agnes, dear,
on your feet.

01:45:07.302 --> 01:45:09.846
Oh, darling,
you look divine.

01:45:10.055 --> 01:45:11.556
Do I really?

01:45:11.765 --> 01:45:13.308
Yes, now come on.

01:45:16.186 --> 01:45:17.813
Enchanting.

01:45:19.606 --> 01:45:20.565
Golly!

01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:24.278
Brian, hang those
furs on the Gooch.

01:45:29.074 --> 01:45:31.410
Auntie Mame,
this is Gloria Upson.

01:45:31.618 --> 01:45:33.328
This is my Auntie Mame,
Mrs. Burnside.

01:45:33.537 --> 01:45:36.415
I can't tell you
how pleased I am

01:45:36.623 --> 01:45:38.792
to make your acquaintance.

01:45:39.001 --> 01:45:42.129
Yes...come in,
children. Do, please.

01:45:42.337 --> 01:45:44.172
There are some
friends of mine

01:45:44.381 --> 01:45:45.632
I'd like you to meet.

01:45:45.882 --> 01:45:47.676
This is my secretary,
Miss Gooch,

01:45:47.884 --> 01:45:49.678
my good right hand,
my Boswell, as it were.

01:45:49.886 --> 01:45:52.139
This is Miss Upson
and my nephew Patrick.

01:45:52.347 --> 01:45:54.558
This is--what is your
boyfriend's name again?

01:45:54.766 --> 01:45:56.435
Oh, Mr. O'Banion.

01:45:56.643 --> 01:46:00.022
You two, run along.
Have a good time.

01:46:00.897 --> 01:46:03.150
Well, good night!

01:46:05.444 --> 01:46:07.529
I can't tell you
how pleased I am

01:46:07.738 --> 01:46:09.698
to have made your acquaintance,
Mr. O'Banion

01:46:09.906 --> 01:46:11.950
and Miss Boswell.

01:46:13.076 --> 01:46:15.829
Well, now, Patrick
tells me how special

01:46:16.079 --> 01:46:17.873
you are to him.

01:46:18.081 --> 01:46:20.625
That means you're
very special to me, too.

01:46:21.543 --> 01:46:24.504
Mmm, my! What
a stunning apartment.

01:46:24.713 --> 01:46:25.756
Thank you.

01:46:25.964 --> 01:46:28.258
Books are awfully decorative,
don't you think?

01:46:28.467 --> 01:46:30.135
Won't you sit down?

01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:32.346
Can I get you
something?

01:46:32.554 --> 01:46:33.805
A Cognac?
A Drambuie?

01:46:34.056 --> 01:46:36.350
Would you like
another hot chocolate?

01:46:36.558 --> 01:46:37.559
Oh, not a thing.

01:46:37.768 --> 01:46:39.019
On our way to
Bunny Bixler's,

01:46:39.269 --> 01:46:41.480
my friend on park Avenue
and 71st street,

01:46:41.688 --> 01:46:44.524
Patrick and I stuffed ourselves
at Schrafft's.

01:46:44.733 --> 01:46:47.486
Do you know what
your silly nephew did?

01:46:47.694 --> 01:46:50.864
He spoke French
to the counterman.

01:46:51.114 --> 01:46:52.908
Imagine anybody
speaking French

01:46:53.116 --> 01:46:56.495
to a counterman
at Schrafft's.

01:46:56.703 --> 01:46:58.330
Show-off.

01:47:03.001 --> 01:47:04.836
Well,
if nobody minds,

01:47:05.045 --> 01:47:07.381
I think
I'll have something.

01:47:07.589 --> 01:47:08.965
You're...

01:47:09.174 --> 01:47:11.259
You're at school,
dear?

01:47:11.468 --> 01:47:14.221
I'm an upper Richmond
girls school girl.

01:47:14.471 --> 01:47:17.224
How did you get
that lovely tan

01:47:17.432 --> 01:47:18.892
so early
in the spring?

01:47:19.101 --> 01:47:20.977
Oh, I played hooky
for a couple of weeks.

01:47:21.228 --> 01:47:22.979
Mums and Daddums and I
went down

01:47:23.230 --> 01:47:24.439
to our place
in Fort Lauderdale.

01:47:24.689 --> 01:47:26.233
We have a place
in Fort Lauderdale.

01:47:26.441 --> 01:47:28.902
I was out of my mind
until she got back.

01:47:29.111 --> 01:47:31.279
I'm insanely jealous
of this kid.

01:47:31.488 --> 01:47:33.323
Sheer torture
and I love it.

01:47:33.532 --> 01:47:35.117
Silly.

01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:42.416
Tell me, dear,
have you...

01:47:42.666 --> 01:47:45.210
Have you chosen
your major yet?

01:47:46.837 --> 01:47:49.297
Chosen my major?

01:47:49.506 --> 01:47:51.800
What courses are you
taking at college?

01:47:52.217 --> 01:47:56.138
Oh! Just a general
sort of liberal arts thing.

01:47:56.388 --> 01:47:58.098
You know, English lit
and like that.

01:47:58.306 --> 01:47:59.808
Upper Richmond's
top-drawer.

01:48:00.016 --> 01:48:01.810
Really top-drawer.

01:48:05.021 --> 01:48:07.983
How did you two
ever get acquainted?

01:48:08.191 --> 01:48:11.445
Oh, uncle Dwight
introduced us.

01:48:11.653 --> 01:48:13.363
Uncle Dwight?
Oh, oh, yes.

01:48:13.572 --> 01:48:15.949
Well, he's not
really my uncle,

01:48:16.199 --> 01:48:18.910
but he's been a real
close friend of the family

01:48:19.161 --> 01:48:21.037
ever since
I was a little girl

01:48:21.288 --> 01:48:23.748
with braces
on my teeth.

01:48:25.125 --> 01:48:27.836
One day I must meet
mums and Daddums.

01:48:28.086 --> 01:48:29.129
We don't want to
bother you

01:48:29.337 --> 01:48:30.505
with a lot
of family stuff.

01:48:30.714 --> 01:48:33.550
Naturally, we'll expect you
at the wedding.

01:48:35.844 --> 01:48:37.471
Wedding?

01:48:37.679 --> 01:48:39.514
Is there a wedding?

01:48:39.723 --> 01:48:42.767
I told you it was
definite, Auntie Mame.

01:48:45.061 --> 01:48:48.440
It's awfully good
of you to let me know.

01:48:50.066 --> 01:48:52.486
We've decided on
a September wedding

01:48:52.694 --> 01:48:54.529
at our place
in Montebank.

01:48:54.738 --> 01:48:55.989
September?

01:48:56.239 --> 01:48:58.408
Tell me, just where
is Montebank?

01:48:58.617 --> 01:49:00.285
Oh, it's right
above Darien.

01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:01.828
Oh, you'll love it.

01:49:02.037 --> 01:49:03.163
It's awfully pretty,

01:49:03.371 --> 01:49:05.290
and it's terribly
handy to the city.

01:49:05.665 --> 01:49:08.460
Of course, it's
completely restricted.

01:49:10.086 --> 01:49:12.464
I'll get
a blood test.

01:49:12.672 --> 01:49:14.174
We'd better hurry.
We want to catch

01:49:14.424 --> 01:49:15.842
an Italian picture
at the Plaza.

01:49:16.051 --> 01:49:18.428
Oh, those awful
foreign movies.

01:49:18.637 --> 01:49:21.515
What I go through
for your nephew,

01:49:21.723 --> 01:49:23.975
but he is cute,
isn't he?

01:49:24.226 --> 01:49:25.852
Yes, isn't he?

01:49:26.102 --> 01:49:28.104
I can't tell you
how pleased I am

01:49:28.313 --> 01:49:29.564
to have made
your acquaintance.

01:49:29.773 --> 01:49:32.526
Yes, thank you, dear.
Thank you.

01:49:33.276 --> 01:49:35.320
Well?
Isn't she terrific?

01:49:35.695 --> 01:49:38.323
Oh, yes, dear.
Yes, she is.

01:49:38.532 --> 01:49:40.325
So are you,
Auntie Mame.

01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:43.119
You're really
top-drawer, I mean--

01:49:44.704 --> 01:49:46.289
well, you know
what I mean.

01:49:52.671 --> 01:49:56.675
Now, why did I ever
buy him those long pants?

01:50:05.183 --> 01:50:06.935
Better hang on
to the red dye.

01:50:07.143 --> 01:50:09.813
I may want to go
back to it

01:50:10.021 --> 01:50:11.606
after visiting
the Upsons.

01:50:11.815 --> 01:50:14.234
It's just what you wanted,
Mrs. Burnside--respectable.

01:50:14.484 --> 01:50:15.735
If a bit drab.

01:50:15.944 --> 01:50:18.154
Oh, Ito, did you
bring the car around?

01:50:18.363 --> 01:50:20.156
Missy, I go to garage.
No Duesenberg.

01:50:20.365 --> 01:50:22.117
Mr. O'Banion
no bring back.

01:50:22.492 --> 01:50:23.785
I hope nothing
has happened--

01:50:23.994 --> 01:50:25.120
to Agnes, I mean.

01:50:25.328 --> 01:50:26.955
I'll call Mr. Lindsay,
borrow one of his.

01:50:27.163 --> 01:50:29.332
Don't forget the maps
and the Martinis.

01:50:34.462 --> 01:50:36.131
What happen,
Missy Gooch?

01:50:36.339 --> 01:50:38.633
I lived!

01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:41.136
What kind party
was that?

01:50:41.344 --> 01:50:42.804
I don't remember.

01:50:43.013 --> 01:50:46.308
All that champagne--
I don't remember a thing.

01:50:46.558 --> 01:50:48.518
I think we went
to a movie.

01:50:48.727 --> 01:50:50.937
Yeah. There was
a wedding in it,

01:50:51.187 --> 01:50:53.189
and Gary Cooper
was the groom.

01:50:53.398 --> 01:50:55.775
I don't remember
who the girl was,

01:50:55.984 --> 01:50:59.654
but it made me cry.
Where's Mrs. Burnside?

01:50:59.904 --> 01:51:01.865
She get ready
to go to Connecticut.

01:51:02.073 --> 01:51:03.199
Where Duesenberg?

01:51:03.408 --> 01:51:05.076
I don't know.
Mr. O'Banion said

01:51:05.285 --> 01:51:07.454
he just had to meet
my mother.

01:51:07.662 --> 01:51:10.081
Then we got on
the Staten Island ferry,

01:51:10.290 --> 01:51:12.626
and he disappeared.

01:51:12.876 --> 01:51:14.669
I've got to see
Mrs. Burnside

01:51:14.919 --> 01:51:16.546
before she goes.

01:51:16.755 --> 01:51:18.256
Is anything wrong,
Missy Gooch?

01:51:18.465 --> 01:51:20.342
I did just what
she told me--

01:51:20.759 --> 01:51:22.385
I lived!

01:51:22.636 --> 01:51:25.972
I've gotta find out
what to do now.

01:51:44.491 --> 01:51:45.700
I think
it's a good match

01:51:45.909 --> 01:51:48.244
for our
little Gloria.

01:51:48.453 --> 01:51:50.538
I can't understand
why Dwight didn't want us

01:51:50.747 --> 01:51:51.998
to meet the aunt.

01:51:52.207 --> 01:51:54.709
We never would have
if she hadn't phoned.

01:51:54.959 --> 01:51:55.960
I'm glad she did.

01:51:56.169 --> 01:51:58.254
I've been dying
to get a look at her.

01:51:58.463 --> 01:52:00.048
Where is she now?

01:52:00.256 --> 01:52:01.925
Freshening up
in the guest room.

01:52:02.133 --> 01:52:05.970
That's an expensive
outfit she's wearing.

01:52:06.179 --> 01:52:08.473
I looked at the label
in her coat.

01:52:08.682 --> 01:52:09.933
Pss!

01:52:10.141 --> 01:52:11.893
I'll bet she's
a lot better fixed

01:52:12.102 --> 01:52:13.603
than Dwight figured.

01:52:14.437 --> 01:52:16.606
I hope it's all right
to have a cocktail hour

01:52:16.815 --> 01:52:18.233
here in the patio.

01:52:18.441 --> 01:52:21.027
I wouldn't want her
to think we live like gypsies.

01:52:21.277 --> 01:52:25.073
You show me a gypsy
that lives like we do!

01:52:25.281 --> 01:52:28.535
Shh! Claude,
you be genteel

01:52:28.743 --> 01:52:30.954
in front of
Mrs. Burnside.

01:52:31.162 --> 01:52:33.415
Yoo-hoo!

01:52:33.623 --> 01:52:35.291
That must be she.

01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:39.379
We're out here on the patio,
Mrs. Burnside.

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:44.676
Oh, what a delightful spot
you have here.

01:52:44.968 --> 01:52:46.261
We adore
Montebank.

01:52:46.469 --> 01:52:47.554
Of course,

01:52:47.762 --> 01:52:48.638
we always spend
the summers

01:52:48.847 --> 01:52:50.849
at our camp
in the Adirondacks.

01:52:51.099 --> 01:52:52.559
We call it
Upson pines.

01:52:52.767 --> 01:52:54.394
We leave
next week.

01:52:54.644 --> 01:52:58.481
There's one thing we ought
to get straight right off.

01:52:58.690 --> 01:53:02.110
You do take a little nip
now and then?

01:53:03.486 --> 01:53:05.947
On festive
occasions.

01:53:06.156 --> 01:53:07.741
Good!

01:53:07.991 --> 01:53:10.869
I'll have an Upson daiquiri
ready for you in a minute.

01:53:11.119 --> 01:53:12.036
I cannot get over

01:53:12.245 --> 01:53:14.247
all the thought
you've given

01:53:14.456 --> 01:53:16.291
every detail of your
house, Mrs. Upson.

01:53:16.499 --> 01:53:18.334
We've done
everything we could

01:53:18.543 --> 01:53:21.296
to make it seem like
authentic colonial America.

01:53:21.504 --> 01:53:23.673
Oh, and how well
you've succeeded.

01:53:23.882 --> 01:53:25.467
All those
enchanting miniatures

01:53:25.675 --> 01:53:27.927
in the powder room

01:53:28.178 --> 01:53:29.596
of John Quincy Adams.

01:53:29.846 --> 01:53:30.805
I'll bet
you didn't see

01:53:31.014 --> 01:53:32.140
our driveway
signpost.

01:53:32.348 --> 01:53:34.267
I did, I did.
What a divine name

01:53:34.476 --> 01:53:35.560
you've given
this place--

01:53:35.769 --> 01:53:37.771
Upson downs.

01:53:38.021 --> 01:53:39.606
I'll bet you
thought of that,

01:53:39.856 --> 01:53:40.648
Mrs. Upson.

01:53:40.857 --> 01:53:42.150
No. That was Claude.

01:53:42.358 --> 01:53:43.818
I'm just
a homebody.

01:53:44.027 --> 01:53:45.361
Claude's
the clever one.

01:53:45.570 --> 01:53:47.155
- Aw...
- aw...

01:53:47.363 --> 01:53:49.824
Now, Mrs. Upson,
I was thinking--

01:53:50.074 --> 01:53:51.326
Doris, dear.

01:53:51.534 --> 01:53:52.786
Doris.

01:53:53.036 --> 01:53:54.954
Well, you
must call me Mame.

01:53:55.163 --> 01:53:56.623
Mamie.

01:53:57.373 --> 01:53:58.708
Uh, Mame.

01:53:58.917 --> 01:54:01.836
Well, Mamie old girl,
here's your poison.

01:54:02.045 --> 01:54:04.839
I make my daiquiris
with a secret ingredient

01:54:05.089 --> 01:54:08.384
I learned from this native
down in Havana, Cuba.

01:54:08.593 --> 01:54:10.678
You'll never guess what
that secret ingredient is.

01:54:11.054 --> 01:54:12.806
I'll say this much--

01:54:13.056 --> 01:54:16.851
there's no sugar
in the Claude Upson daiquiri.

01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:21.523
And yet it's so sweet.

01:54:21.773 --> 01:54:24.484
Whatever do you use?

01:54:24.734 --> 01:54:27.028
Chocolate ice cream?

01:54:27.237 --> 01:54:28.530
Choc--

01:54:28.738 --> 01:54:30.990
oh ho ho ho ho!
Ha ha ha!

01:54:31.199 --> 01:54:33.034
Oh, say, that's rich.

01:54:33.243 --> 01:54:35.078
You hear that, Doris?

01:54:35.286 --> 01:54:36.538
Chocolate
ice cream.

01:54:36.788 --> 01:54:38.540
Ah ha ha ha ha!

01:54:38.748 --> 01:54:40.083
I'll tell you.

01:54:40.291 --> 01:54:43.044
Since you're practically
one of the family,

01:54:43.253 --> 01:54:46.005
I'll let you in
on my little secret.

01:54:46.214 --> 01:54:48.049
Honey.

01:54:48.258 --> 01:54:49.509
I beg pardon?

01:54:49.759 --> 01:54:53.096
Strained honey,
that's the secret ingredient.

01:54:53.346 --> 01:54:54.514
Oh, I see.

01:54:54.764 --> 01:54:58.059
Of course, I use
quite a little rum, too.

01:54:58.268 --> 01:54:59.519
Now, now, now.

01:54:59.769 --> 01:55:01.563
Yes. Oh, yes, I--

01:55:01.813 --> 01:55:04.524
ha ha ha ha!
Ya ha ha!

01:55:04.774 --> 01:55:06.025
Now, Mamie,

01:55:06.234 --> 01:55:08.444
I've made these
especially for you.

01:55:08.653 --> 01:55:10.738
Oh, my, my, my,
my, my.

01:55:11.114 --> 01:55:12.866
Don't they
look delicious!

01:55:13.116 --> 01:55:15.451
Well, well, well,
well, well, well...

01:55:18.454 --> 01:55:20.498
What are they?

01:55:20.707 --> 01:55:23.251
Well, I take 2 cans
of tuna fish,

01:55:23.501 --> 01:55:25.253
put them through
the meat grinder,

01:55:25.461 --> 01:55:28.256
then add clam juice
and peanut butter.

01:55:28.506 --> 01:55:31.217
It's a recipe from the
<i>Ladies' Home Journal.</i>

01:55:31.467 --> 01:55:34.762
These others are just plain
Jack cheese and chutney.

01:55:34.971 --> 01:55:36.806
Sit you down, Mamie.

01:55:37.015 --> 01:55:39.100
I've something
special to show you.

01:55:39.475 --> 01:55:41.227
Oh, baby pictures
of Gloria.

01:55:41.477 --> 01:55:43.688
The whole family,
more or less.

01:55:43.897 --> 01:55:46.816
Ah, on a bear rug.
Isn't that precious?

01:55:47.025 --> 01:55:49.777
Better not let Patrick
see that one.

01:55:49.986 --> 01:55:53.489
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

01:55:53.698 --> 01:55:55.366
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha!

01:55:55.575 --> 01:55:56.951
Oh, my, my.

01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:58.286
Oh, that's Miss Tuthill,

01:55:58.536 --> 01:56:00.371
little glory's
first schoolteacher.

01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:02.916
I think the light
was hurting her eyes.

01:56:03.166 --> 01:56:03.917
Yep, yep, yep.

01:56:04.125 --> 01:56:05.793
Enough of this
girlie-girlie talk.

01:56:06.169 --> 01:56:08.463
As long as we
have Mamie here,

01:56:08.671 --> 01:56:09.756
we oughta let her know

01:56:10.006 --> 01:56:13.551
what the plans are
for Patrick's career.

01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:15.511
Dwight Babcock and I
have that coordinated.

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:16.971
When the kiddies

01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:18.306
return from
their honeymoon,

01:56:18.556 --> 01:56:19.432
I want Patrick
to take his choice.

01:56:19.641 --> 01:56:21.559
With my connections,
I can slip him

01:56:21.851 --> 01:56:23.311
into a berth
on Madison Avenue

01:56:23.561 --> 01:56:25.313
or a seat on
the stock exchange.

01:56:25.521 --> 01:56:26.564
A seat and a berth--

01:56:26.856 --> 01:56:28.232
my Patrick--
oh, pardon me.

01:56:28.524 --> 01:56:29.359
I'm so sorry.

01:56:29.609 --> 01:56:31.819
Say, you're a pretty
fast drinker.

01:56:32.028 --> 01:56:33.696
I'm way ahead
of you.

01:56:33.905 --> 01:56:37.075
You don't happen to like
gin, do you, Mamie?

01:56:37.283 --> 01:56:38.618
I adore it.

01:56:38.826 --> 01:56:39.994
Good. After dinner,

01:56:40.203 --> 01:56:41.871
we'll get out the cards
and play.

01:56:42.121 --> 01:56:43.539
Now the problem
of what to give

01:56:43.748 --> 01:56:44.916
the kiddies for
a wedding present,

01:56:45.208 --> 01:56:46.501
and I've got that
all settled, too.

01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:48.378
Here's my idea,
Mamie.

01:56:48.586 --> 01:56:50.213
Why don't we
get together,

01:56:50.421 --> 01:56:51.506
you and I,

01:56:51.714 --> 01:56:53.591
and buy the
newlyweds that?

01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:54.842
What?

01:56:55.051 --> 01:56:56.427
That lot
right next door.

01:56:56.636 --> 01:56:57.512
Wouldn't that
make

01:56:57.887 --> 01:56:58.888
a wedding
present, though?

01:56:59.097 --> 01:57:00.223
We could take
out this wall,

01:57:00.431 --> 01:57:01.307
and their patio

01:57:01.557 --> 01:57:02.350
would come smack
up against ours.

01:57:02.558 --> 01:57:04.018
You couldn't tell
where one left off

01:57:04.227 --> 01:57:05.687
and the other one
began.

01:57:06.104 --> 01:57:07.021
You wouldn't
be losing a daughter.

01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:08.898
You'd be gaining a patio.

01:57:09.107 --> 01:57:12.026
Yeah. We got to
work fast, though.

01:57:12.235 --> 01:57:13.361
There are
some people

01:57:13.611 --> 01:57:15.029
bidding
on that property...

01:57:15.279 --> 01:57:17.031
- Wrong kind.
- Oh?

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:18.574
Yeah, a fella
named Epstein.

01:57:18.783 --> 01:57:20.034
Abraham Epstein.

01:57:20.284 --> 01:57:22.370
The cellist?
How lucky you are.

01:57:22.578 --> 01:57:24.497
All that glorious music
right next door.

01:57:24.706 --> 01:57:27.041
She's a darling, one of
the nicest women I've met.

01:57:27.250 --> 01:57:30.044
You don't understand
quite how it is up here,

01:57:30.294 --> 01:57:32.046
but this section
is restricted

01:57:32.255 --> 01:57:34.507
only up to
our property line.

01:57:34.716 --> 01:57:37.385
We feel we have
an obligation to make sure

01:57:37.593 --> 01:57:39.512
that...well...
you know.

01:57:39.721 --> 01:57:42.056
Tell you what.
I'll buy it.

01:57:42.265 --> 01:57:43.933
We'll divvy it up
50-50.

01:57:44.142 --> 01:57:47.895
You won't have to
worry about a thing.

01:57:53.735 --> 01:57:56.154
My, my, my, my, my.

01:57:56.404 --> 01:57:58.906
You've thought
of everything, haven't you?

01:57:59.115 --> 01:58:01.034
Laid out Patrick's career,

01:58:02.035 --> 01:58:03.369
planned the wedding...

01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:08.041
Even chosen my gift.

01:58:10.918 --> 01:58:13.171
Well, I guess there's
only one thing left

01:58:13.379 --> 01:58:14.714
for me to do.

01:58:14.964 --> 01:58:16.507
What's that?

01:58:16.716 --> 01:58:18.926
The day you get back
from prickly pines,

01:58:19.135 --> 01:58:22.013
I'll give an intimate
family dinner.

01:58:22.221 --> 01:58:23.931
Well,
how about that?

01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:25.767
Mamie,
that's lovely!

01:58:26.184 --> 01:58:28.019
You're a good scout,
Mamie!

01:58:28.227 --> 01:58:30.021
By golly,
you're top-drawer!

01:58:30.313 --> 01:58:31.522
Ha ha ha!

01:58:31.731 --> 01:58:33.066
Ha ha ha!

01:58:42.825 --> 01:58:44.452
That's a very
interesting design,

01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:45.787
Mr. Christianson,

01:58:45.995 --> 01:58:47.997
but are you sure
you planned it

01:58:48.206 --> 01:58:49.540
with that end up?

01:58:49.791 --> 01:58:50.958
Well...

01:58:53.503 --> 01:58:55.505
That is the beauty
of it, madam.

01:58:55.713 --> 01:58:57.673
It can be used
upside-down.

01:59:17.527 --> 01:59:18.820
Hello.

01:59:19.028 --> 01:59:20.613
Just leave it
outside, please.

01:59:23.491 --> 01:59:26.536
I'm so sorry.
You must be Patrick Dennis.

01:59:26.744 --> 01:59:29.163
Guilty. Are you guilty
of all of this?

01:59:29.372 --> 01:59:31.290
No. I'm not the decorator.

01:59:31.499 --> 01:59:33.668
I'm your aunt's
private secretary, Pegeen Ryan.

01:59:33.876 --> 01:59:35.086
How do you do?

01:59:35.378 --> 01:59:36.587
Hello.

01:59:36.796 --> 01:59:38.631
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:40.174
I've been away
all summer.

01:59:40.424 --> 01:59:42.176
Been a lot of changes
around here.

01:59:42.385 --> 01:59:43.636
Leave it to
my Auntie Mame.

01:59:43.845 --> 01:59:45.555
Where did she
dig up this stuff?

01:59:45.763 --> 01:59:48.432
This is the only set
of its kind

01:59:48.724 --> 01:59:50.393
in the universe.
It's made by

01:59:50.601 --> 01:59:53.104
the famous Danish
designer, Yul Uhlu.

01:59:53.312 --> 01:59:54.188
Who?

01:59:55.273 --> 01:59:56.607
Yul Uhlu.

01:59:58.484 --> 01:59:59.402
Say that
to the right fella,

01:59:59.610 --> 02:00:01.404
and you'll get kissed.

02:00:03.739 --> 02:00:06.409
Oh, incidentally,
congratulations.

02:00:06.617 --> 02:00:07.994
I hear you're getting
married next week.

02:00:08.202 --> 02:00:10.288
Week from next Tuesday.
The old ball and chain.

02:00:10.496 --> 02:00:12.373
Oh, gee,
I wish I'd said that.

02:00:12.582 --> 02:00:13.291
How about,

02:00:13.499 --> 02:00:14.625
"the first 100 years
are the hardest"?

02:00:14.876 --> 02:00:16.294
That's a good one.

02:00:16.502 --> 02:00:19.630
How about, "marriage is
a great institution...

02:00:19.881 --> 02:00:22.550
Yeah, but who wants to be
in an institution?"

02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:26.596
Well, that's
enough of that.

02:00:28.055 --> 02:00:29.182
Patrick!

02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:32.185
Patrick,
my little love!

02:00:32.393 --> 02:00:35.229
Ohh! I'm so glad
to see you, darling.

02:00:35.479 --> 02:00:38.024
Did you have a good time
at Upsy Pinesy?

02:00:38.232 --> 02:00:40.067
I had a wonderful time!
I'll tell you about it.

02:00:40.276 --> 02:00:41.736
Now, what is the idea--

02:00:41.944 --> 02:00:44.822
I have to go to Montebank.
Doris insisted.

02:00:45.031 --> 02:00:47.116
They adored you,
but why did you change--

02:00:47.325 --> 02:00:48.576
I'm so relieved.

02:00:48.784 --> 02:00:50.661
I want everything to be
extra-special tonight.

02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:51.829
And to give the Upsons

02:00:52.121 --> 02:00:53.789
as cozy a time
as they gave me.

02:00:53.998 --> 02:00:55.249
Now, Pegeen, dear--

02:00:55.499 --> 02:00:56.834
ooh, I forgot
the horror.

02:00:57.126 --> 02:00:59.128
Would somebody give me
a hand with the ladder?

02:00:59.337 --> 02:01:00.546
Patrick, the ladder.
Pegeen.

02:01:00.755 --> 02:01:02.381
Now, the fish food.
Where's the fish food?

02:01:02.590 --> 02:01:04.675
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

02:01:04.926 --> 02:01:07.511
Agnes, mustn't nibble
on the hors d'oeuvres.

02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:09.096
You'll get fat.

02:01:09.305 --> 02:01:11.599
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Burnside.

02:01:11.849 --> 02:01:14.310
Gee...I try to do
exactly as you say.

02:01:14.518 --> 02:01:15.811
Come and get it.
Come and get it.

02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:18.856
- Come along.
- Come along.

02:01:19.065 --> 02:01:20.650
You're so wonderful!

02:01:20.858 --> 02:01:23.736
Nobody else would
have taken me in,

02:01:23.945 --> 02:01:25.279
an outcast of society.

02:01:25.529 --> 02:01:26.697
Twaddle!
I'm the grateful one.

02:01:26.906 --> 02:01:28.741
You've given me
someone to look after,

02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:30.284
now that
I'm losing Patrick.

02:01:30.534 --> 02:01:32.370
I wish I had someone
to look after.

02:01:32.578 --> 02:01:34.163
Oh, you will,
you will, dear.

02:01:34.372 --> 02:01:35.831
Where do you
want this set up?

02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:37.250
Right there
will be fine.

02:01:37.416 --> 02:01:38.751
Ah!

02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.670
What's that
supposed to be?

02:01:40.878 --> 02:01:42.546
You don't
like it?

02:01:42.755 --> 02:01:46.717
It might be a little
avant-garde for the Upsons.

02:01:46.926 --> 02:01:48.761
Oh, dear. Pegeen,
take it right down.

02:01:48.970 --> 02:01:50.888
I want everything
to be perfect tonight.

02:01:51.097 --> 02:01:53.349
I think
it's very unusual.

02:01:53.557 --> 02:01:55.518
Agnes!
What's she doing here?

02:01:55.768 --> 02:01:56.978
Where else
would she be

02:01:57.228 --> 02:01:58.271
in her friendless
condition?

02:01:58.521 --> 02:01:59.480
This is one thing

02:01:59.689 --> 02:02:00.982
the Upsons simply
won't understand!

02:02:01.190 --> 02:02:02.358
We don't need
to talk about it.

02:02:02.566 --> 02:02:03.526
Perhaps
they won't notice.

02:02:05.236 --> 02:02:06.612
They're here!
They're here!

02:02:06.862 --> 02:02:08.489
Will somebody
help me get this down?

02:02:08.698 --> 02:02:09.782
Help her, darling.

02:02:09.991 --> 02:02:10.741
Leave it up.

02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:12.201
Get the ladder
out of here.

02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:14.036
Norah, Ito, somebody
answer the door.

02:02:14.245 --> 02:02:15.538
I'll get it.

02:02:15.788 --> 02:02:17.456
Oh, no, you don't!

02:02:17.665 --> 02:02:20.543
Agnes, go to your
room and stay there.

02:02:20.793 --> 02:02:23.045
But what'll I do,
Mrs. Burnside?

02:02:23.296 --> 02:02:25.047
Sleep, Agnes, knit,
start making up names--

02:02:25.256 --> 02:02:27.049
Rudolph, Abigail,
Beulah, Clara, anything.

02:02:39.145 --> 02:02:41.564
Welcome to
the Burnside fireside.

02:02:41.772 --> 02:02:43.065
Mamie!

02:02:43.316 --> 02:02:44.734
How I have
looked forward

02:02:44.984 --> 02:02:45.901
to this evening.

02:02:46.110 --> 02:02:48.112
Come in.
And Claude.

02:02:48.362 --> 02:02:50.573
Well, good
to see you, Mamie!

02:02:50.823 --> 02:02:52.491
Ah, ah, ah!
And little glory.

02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:54.118
I can't tell you

02:02:54.327 --> 02:02:55.953
how pleased I am
to see you again.

02:02:56.162 --> 02:02:57.621
Yes, dear.

02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:59.123
My!

02:02:59.332 --> 02:03:01.584
Say!

02:03:01.792 --> 02:03:04.003
My, my, my, my, my!

02:03:04.211 --> 02:03:05.921
Hi, everybody.

02:03:06.130 --> 02:03:08.132
Well, hello, son.

02:03:09.508 --> 02:03:10.926
Patrick!

02:03:11.135 --> 02:03:12.511
Gloria.

02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:15.097
Say, I made up
the best joke

02:03:15.306 --> 02:03:17.099
on the way up
in the elevator.

02:03:17.308 --> 02:03:18.601
Listen to this.

02:03:18.851 --> 02:03:20.936
Why is an elevator
man's job

02:03:21.145 --> 02:03:23.105
like my place
in Connecticut?

02:03:23.356 --> 02:03:24.398
Give up?

02:03:24.607 --> 02:03:25.941
Almost.

02:03:26.150 --> 02:03:28.110
Well,
I'll tell you.

02:03:28.361 --> 02:03:30.946
Because it has
its ups and downs!

02:03:31.155 --> 02:03:33.741
You get it?
Upson downs!

02:03:36.744 --> 02:03:39.288
Clever.
Clever.

02:03:39.497 --> 02:03:41.457
Well, you just think
of those things...

02:03:41.707 --> 02:03:43.292
Do sit down.

02:03:43.501 --> 02:03:44.210
Oh, thank you.

02:03:44.418 --> 02:03:45.503
Aah!

02:03:46.754 --> 02:03:49.382
Doris! Oh, you're not
comfortable there, dear.

02:03:49.590 --> 02:03:52.218
The marvelous thing is that
these are all adjustable.

02:03:52.426 --> 02:03:53.928
This is the master control.

02:03:54.136 --> 02:03:55.846
Each chair
has its own cord.

02:03:56.055 --> 02:03:57.932
Let me see, Doris.
You are number 4.

02:03:58.307 --> 02:04:00.726
1, 2, 3, 4.
Now, here we go.

02:04:00.935 --> 02:04:02.770
Oh! Oh!

02:04:02.978 --> 02:04:04.271
Oh, Claude!

02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:06.857
So sorry, Claude.
You are number 4.

02:04:07.066 --> 02:04:08.192
Doris, you must be
number 5.

02:04:08.442 --> 02:04:09.360
Auntie Mame!

02:04:09.568 --> 02:04:11.529
Patrick, really,
you're confusing me!

02:04:11.779 --> 02:04:14.407
Now, Doris...
Here you are. 5.

02:04:14.615 --> 02:04:15.991
Going up!
Oh!

02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:18.327
There you go. Ah...

02:04:18.536 --> 02:04:20.287
Ah! Oh!

02:04:20.496 --> 02:04:22.790
Isn't it wonderful, Doris?
So easy to sweep under.

02:04:22.998 --> 02:04:26.127
Now, Claude, here we go.
Hang on to your seatbelt.

02:04:26.335 --> 02:04:29.547
Down you go! Oh, my,
what supple legs you have.

02:04:29.922 --> 02:04:31.507
You must have been
studying yogi.

02:04:31.757 --> 02:04:32.800
Here are the drinks.

02:04:33.008 --> 02:04:34.135
Mamie!

02:04:34.343 --> 02:04:36.011
Oh, so sorry,
Doris, dear!

02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:38.639
Ah...there we are,
going down to the main floor.

02:04:38.848 --> 02:04:41.142
Cigars, cigarettes,
lingerie, hardware.

02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:42.810
Ha ha ha ha ha!

02:04:43.018 --> 02:04:44.228
Oh, dear!

02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:49.900
Well, now, Patrick...

02:04:50.151 --> 02:04:53.863
And little glory.

02:04:54.071 --> 02:04:56.157
Oh, and here's
uncle Dwight.

02:04:56.365 --> 02:04:57.575
Claude?

02:04:57.783 --> 02:04:59.201
Dwight!

02:04:59.410 --> 02:05:02.538
Well, how are you?

02:05:02.746 --> 02:05:04.331
Mr. Babcock.

02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:07.501
Mrs. Burnside. We must have
that game of golf soon.

02:05:07.710 --> 02:05:08.669
Oh!

02:05:08.878 --> 02:05:10.713
Oh, my, my,
my, my, my.

02:05:10.921 --> 02:05:12.006
I'm afraid
we'll have to

02:05:12.214 --> 02:05:13.716
take that up a bit.

02:05:13.966 --> 02:05:16.051
Pegeen, better bring
the ladder again.

02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:18.721
Won't you sit down,
Mr. Babcock?

02:05:18.971 --> 02:05:20.723
Thank you.

02:05:20.973 --> 02:05:22.224
Well, now,
they're almost ready,

02:05:22.433 --> 02:05:24.226
the <i>Specialite
de la maison.</i>

02:05:24.435 --> 02:05:26.061
I would
like you to meet

02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:27.646
Miss Pegeen Ryan.

02:05:27.855 --> 02:05:29.523
Take it up a bit,
dear.

02:05:29.732 --> 02:05:32.568
It's getting
in people's...Hair.

02:05:34.570 --> 02:05:36.071
Claude.

02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:37.615
Thank you.

02:05:37.823 --> 02:05:39.200
And Doris.

02:05:39.408 --> 02:05:42.203
Claude, I am not
going to tell you

02:05:42.453 --> 02:05:44.538
one thing that's
in these drinks

02:05:44.747 --> 02:05:45.956
because all
the ingredients

02:05:46.165 --> 02:05:47.208
are secret.

02:05:47.458 --> 02:05:48.876
Oh?

02:05:49.126 --> 02:05:51.629
Now, now, now,
just hang on.

02:05:52.922 --> 02:05:55.549
Oh! Well.

02:05:55.758 --> 02:05:57.885
What do you know?

02:05:58.302 --> 02:06:00.971
The trick is
to drink them up fast

02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:03.516
before all the alcohol
burns away.

02:06:03.766 --> 02:06:06.393
Don't you worry
about a thing, now, Claude.

02:06:06.769 --> 02:06:09.104
I'm fully covered
by fire insurance.

02:06:09.313 --> 02:06:10.564
Oh!

02:06:10.814 --> 02:06:12.066
There, now, Patrick.

02:06:12.274 --> 02:06:13.901
There.

02:06:14.109 --> 02:06:15.402
And little glory.

02:06:15.611 --> 02:06:18.531
A friend of mine,
who may drop in later,

02:06:18.781 --> 02:06:20.407
calls this
the flaming Mame.

02:06:20.616 --> 02:06:22.576
Who? Who?
Who's going to drop in?

02:06:22.785 --> 02:06:24.328
Just family, darling.

02:06:24.537 --> 02:06:26.997
Oh! Oh! Oh!

02:06:27.206 --> 02:06:29.124
Don't be
a scaredy cat, darling.

02:06:29.333 --> 02:06:32.086
There's nothing to be
frightened of whatsoever.

02:06:32.294 --> 02:06:34.129
There, now.

02:06:34.338 --> 02:06:36.423
Are we all lit?

02:06:36.799 --> 02:06:37.800
Wouldn't you
be happier

02:06:38.008 --> 02:06:39.468
if I fixed you
a daiquiri?

02:06:39.677 --> 02:06:40.970
No, no, no.
Not for a minute.

02:06:41.178 --> 02:06:43.013
Your aunt Mamie
made this for me.

02:06:43.389 --> 02:06:47.601
I'm going to drink it.
It looks just fine.

02:06:51.313 --> 02:06:54.191
Mmm! This is spicy!

02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:56.193
Try one of
the striped ones, mums.

02:06:56.402 --> 02:06:57.778
These <i>a re</i> tasty.

02:06:57.987 --> 02:06:59.196
What are they?

02:06:59.405 --> 02:07:01.907
Oh, just plain old
pickled rattlesnake.

02:07:10.291 --> 02:07:11.083
They're pure protein,

02:07:11.292 --> 02:07:12.626
and they always
marinate them

02:07:12.835 --> 02:07:13.961
after they
remove the fangs.

02:07:14.211 --> 02:07:15.462
Why, Mr. Babcock,

02:07:15.671 --> 02:07:17.131
you've gone out.

02:07:17.339 --> 02:07:19.216
Don't bother,
Mrs. Burnside.

02:07:23.637 --> 02:07:25.514
Agnes!

02:07:25.764 --> 02:07:28.976
Agnes, I told you
to stay in your room.

02:07:29.226 --> 02:07:32.146
But Mrs. Burnside,
it's a quarter past 8:00,

02:07:32.354 --> 02:07:33.439
and you told me--

02:07:33.647 --> 02:07:35.649
I told you
to take your pills

02:07:35.899 --> 02:07:37.985
at a quarter
past 8:00.

02:07:38.193 --> 02:07:41.071
But my calcium pills
are in the kitchen.

02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:42.865
Auntie Mame!

02:07:43.073 --> 02:07:45.326
Is that a member
of the family?

02:07:45.534 --> 02:07:46.869
Darned if I know.

02:07:47.244 --> 02:07:49.913
It's a member
of somebody's family.

02:07:52.791 --> 02:07:54.209
Oh, Doris,

02:07:54.418 --> 02:07:57.671
I would like you
to meet my former secretary.

02:07:57.880 --> 02:07:59.548
She's a little bit...

02:07:59.757 --> 02:08:02.843
She's not quite herself
at the moment.

02:08:03.052 --> 02:08:05.262
We know all about
these women's things,

02:08:05.471 --> 02:08:06.764
don't we?

02:08:07.014 --> 02:08:09.183
What's your name, dear?

02:08:09.391 --> 02:08:11.769
Gooch.

02:08:12.019 --> 02:08:15.522
You sit right over here
beside me, Mrs. Gooch.

02:08:36.585 --> 02:08:39.296
And what does
Mr. Gooch do?

02:08:39.505 --> 02:08:41.882
Oh, my father
passed on.

02:08:43.258 --> 02:08:44.635
Oh, no.

02:08:44.843 --> 02:08:46.804
I mean your husband.

02:08:49.014 --> 02:08:50.307
Now, now, Agnes.

02:08:50.516 --> 02:08:52.309
Upsy daisy.
Calcium time.

02:08:54.103 --> 02:08:55.312
Pegeen, dear.

02:08:55.521 --> 02:08:58.065
One thing about Auntie Mame,
she's big-hearted.

02:08:58.482 --> 02:09:01.235
When there's ever anybody
in trouble, she's always...

02:09:01.443 --> 02:09:03.070
I can see that.

02:09:03.487 --> 02:09:05.322
Well, Vera
and Lindsay.

02:09:05.531 --> 02:09:07.324
Mame, darling.

02:09:07.616 --> 02:09:09.660
Like an opening night
without critics.

02:09:09.868 --> 02:09:10.953
Mr. and Mrs. Upson,

02:09:11.161 --> 02:09:12.413
Miss Upson,
Mr. Babcock,

02:09:12.663 --> 02:09:13.914
I would
like you to meet

02:09:14.123 --> 02:09:16.083
my dearest friend,
Vera Charles,

02:09:16.291 --> 02:09:19.670
and the publisher,
Mr. Lindsay Woolsey.

02:09:19.878 --> 02:09:21.839
I'm charmed to meet you,
all of you.

02:09:22.089 --> 02:09:24.508
Miss Charles, I've
just got to tell you

02:09:24.717 --> 02:09:27.636
how I adored you in
<i>Mary of Scotland.</i>

02:09:27.845 --> 02:09:29.680
Did you, dear?
That was Helen Hayes.

02:09:32.099 --> 02:09:33.308
Spirits!

02:09:33.517 --> 02:09:34.560
Vera, darling,

02:09:34.768 --> 02:09:37.354
can I persuade you
to have a drink?

02:09:37.646 --> 02:09:39.356
Yes, dear,
anything but rum.

02:09:39.565 --> 02:09:42.359
I've just been
to the most awful party,

02:09:42.651 --> 02:09:44.862
where they served
nothing but daiquiris

02:09:45.237 --> 02:09:46.321
made with honey.

02:09:49.533 --> 02:09:50.909
Mame!

02:09:51.118 --> 02:09:53.829
Acacius, darling!
<i>Gnothi Seauton.</i>

02:09:54.037 --> 02:09:55.164
<i>Gnothi Seauton.</i>

02:09:55.372 --> 02:09:57.291
Oh, lord!

02:09:57.499 --> 02:09:59.918
Mr. and Mrs. Upson,
Mr. Babcock,

02:10:00.127 --> 02:10:02.421
I would like you to meet
Mr. Acacius Page,

02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:04.548
Patrick's first schoolteacher
in New York

02:10:04.757 --> 02:10:06.467
and a man who had
a great deal to do

02:10:06.675 --> 02:10:08.719
with molding
his character.

02:10:08.927 --> 02:10:11.180
Haven't we met before?

02:10:12.598 --> 02:10:15.517
I don't
recognize the face.

02:10:22.441 --> 02:10:24.276
Acacius, darling,
your lotus juice.

02:10:24.485 --> 02:10:25.736
Auntie Mame,

02:10:27.571 --> 02:10:29.656
I thought this was going
to be a family night.

02:10:29.865 --> 02:10:31.492
Darling, this <i>is</i>
our family.

02:10:31.909 --> 02:10:33.744
Pegeen, are you
having trouble?

02:10:33.952 --> 02:10:35.871
Give her
a helping hand.

02:10:36.079 --> 02:10:37.372
Thank you.

02:10:42.377 --> 02:10:43.754
Thanks,
Lochinvar.

02:10:43.962 --> 02:10:45.005
Courtesy of the house.

02:10:45.380 --> 02:10:46.381
Look,
I'm all right.

02:10:46.590 --> 02:10:48.342
You've got problems
enough of your own.

02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:49.593
Don't I, though?

02:10:49.802 --> 02:10:52.387
That's a pretty picture,
I must say.

02:10:52.638 --> 02:10:54.306
Yes, isn't it?

02:10:54.515 --> 02:10:57.142
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to propose a toast.

02:10:57.351 --> 02:10:59.102
To this lovely
young couple

02:10:59.394 --> 02:11:00.604
as they start up

02:11:00.813 --> 02:11:02.606
the ladder of life
together.

02:11:04.107 --> 02:11:06.151
Oh, no, no,
Auntie Vera.

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:08.987
This isn't Gloria.
That's Gloria.

02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:10.531
Pity.

02:11:13.116 --> 02:11:14.868
Mame, I brought
you something.

02:11:15.285 --> 02:11:16.537
What is it,
Lindsay?

02:11:16.745 --> 02:11:18.372
Be careful.
The ink's wet.

02:11:18.747 --> 02:11:19.873
My book!

02:11:20.082 --> 02:11:23.168
Look, everybody, I'm in print,
just like Edna Ferber.

02:11:23.377 --> 02:11:24.628
Auntie Mame,
you did it!

02:11:24.837 --> 02:11:26.296
I never knew
you went on with it.

02:11:26.505 --> 02:11:27.756
Patrick,
you had vision.

02:11:27.965 --> 02:11:29.049
The way he managed
it, Mame,

02:11:29.258 --> 02:11:30.342
he's just like you.

02:11:30.551 --> 02:11:33.637
My little lifesaver, Patrick!
And Lindsay!

02:11:33.887 --> 02:11:35.722
Patrick, you ol' meanie,
why didn't you tell me

02:11:35.931 --> 02:11:37.349
your aunt
was literate?

02:11:37.599 --> 02:11:39.893
Mame, am I mentioned
in your book?

02:11:40.102 --> 02:11:42.271
Mentioned?
You're exposed.

02:11:42.479 --> 02:11:44.356
Let's drink a toast to
<i>Live, Live, Live,</i>

02:11:44.565 --> 02:11:46.942
by Mame Dennis Burnside.

02:11:47.192 --> 02:11:49.152
Step right up
now, folks,

02:11:49.444 --> 02:11:51.488
and get your
red-hot chapters.

02:11:51.697 --> 02:11:54.616
I've been to so many
wonderful parties here.

02:11:54.825 --> 02:11:57.703
Now I'll find out
how they all ended.

02:11:57.911 --> 02:11:59.621
I forgot
about that time

02:11:59.830 --> 02:12:01.999
we almost got caught
in the speakeasy.

02:12:02.249 --> 02:12:03.876
I was about 10 then.

02:12:04.126 --> 02:12:05.752
Here's all about
the roller skates

02:12:05.961 --> 02:12:07.296
and uncle Beau

02:12:07.838 --> 02:12:11.091
and that Christmas
we were so broke.

02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:13.135
Patrick.

02:12:13.343 --> 02:12:15.470
My little Patrick.

02:12:15.679 --> 02:12:18.140
You could write
a whole book

02:12:18.348 --> 02:12:20.100
about what
happened to me.

02:12:20.475 --> 02:12:22.936
I beg your pardon,
Gloria?

02:12:23.145 --> 02:12:24.938
You could write
a whole book

02:12:25.147 --> 02:12:26.273
about what
happened to me.

02:12:26.481 --> 02:12:28.025
Oh? Oh, thank you.

02:12:28.233 --> 02:12:31.403
Yes. Bunny Bixler and I
were in the semifinals--

02:12:31.612 --> 02:12:34.114
the <i>very</i> semifinals,
mind you--

02:12:34.323 --> 02:12:36.617
of the ping-pong
tournament at the club,

02:12:36.825 --> 02:12:38.911
and this
ghastly thing happened.

02:12:39.161 --> 02:12:41.413
We were both playing
way over our heads,

02:12:41.622 --> 02:12:45.459
and the score was 29-28,

02:12:46.001 --> 02:12:48.170
and we had this
really terrific volley,

02:12:48.378 --> 02:12:52.382
and I stepped back to get
this really terrific shot...

02:12:53.342 --> 02:12:57.888
And I stepped
on the ping-pong ball.

02:12:59.890 --> 02:13:02.476
Well, I just
squashed it to bits.

02:13:02.684 --> 02:13:04.519
Then Bunny and I ran

02:13:04.728 --> 02:13:06.396
to the closet
of the game room

02:13:06.605 --> 02:13:08.065
to get another
ping-pong ball,

02:13:08.273 --> 02:13:10.525
and the closet was locked.

02:13:10.734 --> 02:13:11.652
Imagine!

02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:16.406
We had to call
the whole thing off.

02:13:17.616 --> 02:13:19.493
Well, it was ghastly!

02:13:21.453 --> 02:13:24.498
Well, it was
just ghastly!

02:13:31.713 --> 02:13:33.799
But it was amusing.

02:13:34.007 --> 02:13:36.134
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:13:38.095 --> 02:13:40.180
It's hilarious!

02:13:40.555 --> 02:13:41.765
What is?

02:13:42.140 --> 02:13:44.267
<i>Your</i> story.

02:13:47.562 --> 02:13:49.147
I'm so proud!

02:13:49.398 --> 02:13:52.859
The whole last chapter's
all about me.

02:13:53.068 --> 02:13:55.028
"Fighting the...

02:13:55.237 --> 02:13:57.698
"Stigma of...

02:13:57.948 --> 02:14:00.659
The unwed mother."

02:14:06.581 --> 02:14:08.291
Mr. Upson,
you lucky devil,

02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:09.918
your future
son-in-law's featured

02:14:10.127 --> 02:14:12.713
in one of the raciest
books of the year.

02:14:12.963 --> 02:14:15.674
Patrick, I had no idea
how many times

02:14:15.924 --> 02:14:18.552
you unzipped me
and put me to bed.

02:14:18.927 --> 02:14:20.053
Now just a minute!

02:14:20.262 --> 02:14:21.888
There are
young people here!

02:14:22.264 --> 02:14:23.390
Mr. Upson,
I only did it

02:14:23.598 --> 02:14:25.058
when Miss Charles
had passed out.

02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:28.270
Well!

02:14:30.731 --> 02:14:32.190
Thank you, Ito.

02:14:32.399 --> 02:14:34.735
Don't tell me
she can't come!

02:14:34.943 --> 02:14:36.278
Who? Who?
Who can't come?

02:14:36.486 --> 02:14:38.071
That divine woman with
the snakes we met in Paris.

02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:39.948
She promised to
entertain after dinner.

02:14:40.157 --> 02:14:41.408
Vera, loan me
your glasses.

02:14:41.616 --> 02:14:44.244
"Read of forthcoming
publication of our book.

02:14:44.453 --> 02:14:46.621
"Hereby serve notice
that am entitled

02:14:46.830 --> 02:14:48.582
"to 1/2 of royalties

02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:51.251
for invaluable services
as editor and coauthor."

02:14:51.460 --> 02:14:52.377
Brian!

02:14:53.253 --> 02:14:54.629
Brian!

02:14:55.255 --> 02:14:56.715
"Will return
in a few days

02:14:56.923 --> 02:14:59.342
to claim fruits
of collaboration."

02:15:00.844 --> 02:15:02.763
"My claim
will be substantiated

02:15:03.013 --> 02:15:05.098
by my wife,
Agnes Gooch O'Banion."

02:15:05.307 --> 02:15:06.641
- Wife?
- Wife?

02:15:06.850 --> 02:15:08.602
Agnes.
Think, Agnes, think!

02:15:08.977 --> 02:15:10.103
Think?

02:15:10.312 --> 02:15:11.772
Try!

02:15:14.232 --> 02:15:16.359
Maybe that wasn't
a movie we went to.

02:15:17.986 --> 02:15:19.780
Maybe that wasn't
Gary Cooper.

02:15:19.988 --> 02:15:21.656
It was Brian,

02:15:22.699 --> 02:15:24.367
and the girl was...

02:15:26.912 --> 02:15:28.371
- Me!
- Agnes!

02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:29.664
I'm a bride!

02:15:29.873 --> 02:15:31.458
Oh, darling,
congratulations!

02:15:31.666 --> 02:15:34.753
Oh, isn't it wonderful,
Patrick?

02:15:34.961 --> 02:15:37.255
Oh, darling,
I'm so happy for you!

02:15:37.464 --> 02:15:38.548
Honey, isn't this
terrific?

02:15:38.924 --> 02:15:40.008
This is revolting.

02:15:40.217 --> 02:15:42.219
How can you associate
with people who--

02:15:42.469 --> 02:15:44.096
who aren't
absolutely top-drawer?

02:15:44.346 --> 02:15:46.181
Come on, these are
my oldest friends,

02:15:46.389 --> 02:15:47.432
people who
brought me up.

02:15:47.682 --> 02:15:49.101
A bunch of riffraff.

02:15:49.351 --> 02:15:50.769
I hope when we marry
you won't invite

02:15:50.977 --> 02:15:52.395
people like this
to our house.

02:15:52.604 --> 02:15:54.106
Who will be
coming to our house?

02:15:54.314 --> 02:15:55.524
Bunny Bixler
and Muriel Puce?

02:15:55.774 --> 02:15:57.651
What's wrong
with Muriel puce?

02:15:57.859 --> 02:16:00.320
Nothing, except she has
the I.Q. Of a dead battery.

02:16:00.529 --> 02:16:02.239
As for your other
addlepated girlfriends,

02:16:02.489 --> 02:16:04.491
they're a lot of vain,
selfish, empty bigots!

02:16:05.367 --> 02:16:06.576
Well!

02:16:09.246 --> 02:16:10.580
Mame, it's marvelous!

02:16:10.831 --> 02:16:12.457
You'll make a fortune
out of this book.

02:16:12.707 --> 02:16:14.501
She certainly will,
but not for herself.

02:16:14.751 --> 02:16:16.294
Mame's assigned
all her royalties

02:16:16.503 --> 02:16:18.088
to the Epstein home
in Montebank.

02:16:18.296 --> 02:16:19.422
Epstein the cellist?

02:16:19.714 --> 02:16:21.383
What about
Montebank?

02:16:21.591 --> 02:16:23.677
Can't the Epsteins
afford their own home?

02:16:24.052 --> 02:16:26.721
Vera, they're not
going to live there.

02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:29.349
They're building
a home there

02:16:29.558 --> 02:16:32.184
for refugee
Jewish children.

02:16:32.394 --> 02:16:33.978
What's that?

02:16:34.187 --> 02:16:35.814
Oh, no!

02:16:36.064 --> 02:16:37.773
- Oh!
- No!

02:16:38.066 --> 02:16:39.359
Jackpot!

02:16:43.405 --> 02:16:46.782
Pegeen, call Denmark quick
and get ahold of Yul uhlu.

02:16:48.368 --> 02:16:50.202
You maniac!

02:16:54.207 --> 02:16:55.584
Are you all right,
Doris?

02:16:56.834 --> 02:16:57.919
You ready?

02:16:58.128 --> 02:17:00.129
I've been ready
for quite some time.

02:17:00.338 --> 02:17:01.673
Come, glory.

02:17:01.882 --> 02:17:03.341
You...

02:17:04.593 --> 02:17:05.343
You!

02:17:05.552 --> 02:17:08.305
Claude. Claude!

02:17:08.513 --> 02:17:11.391
Don't be hasty!
Claude! Claude!

02:17:14.019 --> 02:17:15.102
Claude!

02:17:16.855 --> 02:17:18.356
Oh!

02:17:19.983 --> 02:17:22.318
For 9 years,
Mame Dennis Burnside,

02:17:22.568 --> 02:17:25.155
I have done everything
in my power

02:17:25.362 --> 02:17:26.823
to protect this boy

02:17:27.031 --> 02:17:29.325
from your idiotic,
cockeyed nincompoopery!

02:17:29.534 --> 02:17:31.369
And now you've
ruined everything.

02:17:31.577 --> 02:17:33.580
All my plans for Patrick
have just gone down--

02:17:33.788 --> 02:17:35.123
<i>Your</i> plans?

02:17:35.332 --> 02:17:37.083
You have the bill of fare,
haven't you?

02:17:37.459 --> 02:17:39.460
You're shouting orders
for everyone.

02:17:40.587 --> 02:17:42.547
Did it occur to you
this boy might be hungry

02:17:42.755 --> 02:17:45.674
for something you've
never even heard of?

02:17:46.675 --> 02:17:49.596
When Patrick first
walked into my life,

02:17:49.804 --> 02:17:52.098
a frightened little boy,

02:17:52.891 --> 02:17:56.144
hanging on to Norah's hand,

02:17:57.603 --> 02:18:00.232
it was love
at first sight.

02:18:01.191 --> 02:18:02.400
For 9 years,

02:18:02.609 --> 02:18:04.527
I've tried to open
some windows in his life.

02:18:04.818 --> 02:18:07.489
You want to shut him up
in some safe-deposit box!

02:18:07.697 --> 02:18:10.116
I won't let you do that
to my little one.

02:18:12.410 --> 02:18:13.495
Oh, no.

02:18:16.498 --> 02:18:18.375
He's not little anymore.

02:18:21.085 --> 02:18:22.587
And he's not mine,

02:18:22.837 --> 02:18:24.630
but he's not yours,
Mr. Babcock.

02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:26.591
Patrick won't allow you
to settle him down

02:18:26.799 --> 02:18:29.468
in some dry-veined
restricted community,

02:18:29.678 --> 02:18:31.721
make him an Aryan
from Darien,

02:18:31.930 --> 02:18:35.058
and marry him to a girl
with braces on her brains.

02:18:43.441 --> 02:18:45.067
Hee hee hee hee!

02:18:46.611 --> 02:18:48.530
Mame, did you
deliberately

02:18:48.737 --> 02:18:50.323
plan all this?

02:18:52.032 --> 02:18:54.035
Don't be ridiculous,
Vera.

02:18:54.286 --> 02:18:57.831
You know Patrick always
makes all his own decisions.

02:18:58.039 --> 02:19:00.083
Rattlesnake, anyone?

02:19:06.923 --> 02:19:08.424
Thank you...

02:19:10.135 --> 02:19:11.761
Lady Iris.

02:19:14.347 --> 02:19:15.724
Charmed...

02:19:17.058 --> 02:19:19.436
Lord Dudley.

02:19:27.693 --> 02:19:31.239
Punjab, India.
June 28, 1946.

02:19:31.448 --> 02:19:32.656
Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Dennis,

02:19:32.906 --> 02:19:35.243
224 east 50th street,
New York.

02:19:35.451 --> 02:19:37.037
Dear Patrick and Pegeen,

02:19:37.245 --> 02:19:39.331
arriving from India
June 31st.

02:19:39.581 --> 02:19:41.583
Please meet me
Beekman Place apartment.

02:19:41.833 --> 02:19:43.709
Must return India
in 2 weeks

02:19:43.918 --> 02:19:46.588
when uncle Lindsay will have
finished his course

02:19:46.796 --> 02:19:48.130
in yoga.

02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:11.613
Auntie Mame?

02:20:15.158 --> 02:20:16.326
Auntie Mame!

02:20:25.168 --> 02:20:26.669
What were you
doing in there?

02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:29.798
Oh, just giving Michael
his presents, darling.

02:20:30.006 --> 02:20:30.840
Look, dad.

02:20:31.091 --> 02:20:32.801
Which is the front,
Auntie Mame?

02:20:33.093 --> 02:20:35.804
Oh, my little love,
let me help you.

02:20:36.012 --> 02:20:38.390
There, now.
Salaam for your mother

02:20:38.598 --> 02:20:40.225
like Auntie Mame
just taught you.

02:20:41.518 --> 02:20:45.021
Ah, very good,
sahib.

02:20:45.772 --> 02:20:47.357
That's not
a real sword, is it?

02:20:47.607 --> 02:20:48.566
It's a scimitar.

02:20:48.775 --> 02:20:50.110
Oh, dear.

02:20:51.986 --> 02:20:53.571
That's what
I always say.

02:20:53.988 --> 02:20:56.282
In Hindustani,
that means,

02:20:56.491 --> 02:20:59.285
"the water oxen are
waiting at the gate."

02:20:59.494 --> 02:21:01.704
My water oxen's
waiting at Idlewild,

02:21:01.913 --> 02:21:04.290
pan American flight 100
for Karachi.

02:21:04.499 --> 02:21:05.792
Oh, Michael,

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.586
if I could only
show you India--

02:21:08.795 --> 02:21:11.297
the color,
the splendor, the mystery,

02:21:11.506 --> 02:21:13.299
the elephants
in the streets.

02:21:13.508 --> 02:21:15.260
Now, Auntie Mame.

02:21:18.513 --> 02:21:20.098
I know. I know.

02:21:20.306 --> 02:21:21.724
I shouldn't even
bring up the possibility

02:21:21.933 --> 02:21:24.811
of Michael's going
to India with me.

02:21:25.061 --> 02:21:27.981
But Auntie Mame said
she'd love to have me.

02:21:28.189 --> 02:21:29.357
She said so
right in there.

02:21:29.566 --> 02:21:31.693
It's ridiculous, darling.
I won't hear of it.

02:21:31.901 --> 02:21:33.361
Dad?

02:21:33.570 --> 02:21:35.029
Look, it's out
of the question.

02:21:35.238 --> 02:21:36.823
You heard
your mother.

02:21:41.411 --> 02:21:42.787
You know what
your trouble is?

02:21:42.996 --> 02:21:44.831
You don't
live, live, live!

02:21:45.039 --> 02:21:46.291
Life is a banquet,

02:21:46.541 --> 02:21:49.043
and most poor suckers
are starving to death.

02:22:03.766 --> 02:22:06.728
Oh, there's one thing
you've got to remember.

02:22:06.936 --> 02:22:08.605
School begins the day
after labor day.

02:22:08.813 --> 02:22:11.232
He must be back
by then.

02:22:11.524 --> 02:22:13.193
Naturally.

02:22:14.944 --> 02:22:16.738
Of course.

02:22:16.946 --> 02:22:18.531
Labor day.

02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:21.534
That's sometime in
November, isn't it?

02:22:23.411 --> 02:22:25.788
It's the first week in
September, Auntie Mame.

02:22:25.997 --> 02:22:29.876
Labor. The problem of labor
in India is gargantuan.

02:22:30.084 --> 02:22:31.669
What's gargantuan,
Auntie Mame?

02:22:31.878 --> 02:22:33.213
Oh, Michael,
on the plane

02:22:33.421 --> 02:22:35.089
I'll give you
a pad and pencil,

02:22:35.298 --> 02:22:36.674
and you can write down

02:22:36.883 --> 02:22:38.551
all the words
you don't understand.

02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:41.179
Well, now, I've been out
shopping all morning

02:22:41.387 --> 02:22:42.639
for your traveling gear,

02:22:42.889 --> 02:22:46.142
so let's go upstairs
and try things on.

02:22:46.392 --> 02:22:50.230
Oh, Michael, I'm going
to open doors for you,

02:22:51.356 --> 02:22:54.442
doors you never
even dreamed existed.

02:22:54.651 --> 02:22:57.695
I give up.
She's the pied Piper.

02:22:58.071 --> 02:23:00.823
Oh, what times
we're going to have.

02:23:01.032 --> 02:23:04.118
What vistas we're going
to explore together.

02:23:04.369 --> 02:23:07.580
We'll spend a day
at an ancient Hindu temple.

02:23:07.789 --> 02:23:10.250
The head monk is a friend
of Auntie Mame's.

02:23:10.458 --> 02:23:12.585
Perhaps he'll let you
ring the temple bells

02:23:12.794 --> 02:23:14.587
that bring
the monks to prayer.

02:23:14.837 --> 02:23:17.215
There, on the highest tower
on a clear day,

02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:19.509
you can see the Taj Mahal.

02:23:19.759 --> 02:23:21.803
Beyond that
is a beautiful...
