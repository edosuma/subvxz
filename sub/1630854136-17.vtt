00:09.400 --> 00:11.402
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:11.402 --> 00:12.751
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:12.751 --> 00:15.189
<i>by two separate,
yet equally important groups:</i>

00:15.189 --> 00:17.060
<i>the police,
who investigate crime,</i>

00:17.060 --> 00:20.020
<i>and the district attorneys,
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:21.760
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:23.066 --> 00:24.154
Hey, Rachel.
It's me.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.329
I know we said 7:00,

00:25.329 --> 00:26.765
but I'm still
a couple of minutes out.

00:26.765 --> 00:28.071
I will see you soon.

00:40.344 --> 00:42.085
Hey, Rachel.
It's me again.

00:42.085 --> 00:45.132
I'm 30 minutes late,
but I'm here.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.176
I'm really sorry.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.786
A witness interview ran long,

00:47.786 --> 00:50.398
and I lost track of time.

00:50.398 --> 00:53.618
Just call me back
if you need to reschedule.

01:24.910 --> 01:25.998
Rachel.

01:25.998 --> 01:28.740
Oh, my God.

01:33.876 --> 01:37.619
Yeah, I need an ambulance
at Sutton Place Park.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.146
- Talk to us.
- Stabbing.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.192
Single wound.
Bled out.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.498
MLI puts time of death
at about 7:00 p.m.

01:47.498 --> 01:50.762
DOA is Rachel Bender,
38 Red Hook.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.155
Cash and credit cards
are still here.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.114
We can cross off robbery.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.332
Any signs of sexual assault?

01:55.332 --> 01:57.421
MLI says no indications.

01:57.421 --> 01:58.727
Found the wallet here

01:58.727 --> 02:00.250
and got the fresh shoe print
in the mud there.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.122
Get an imprint
of that to the lab.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.427
I'll let them know.

02:03.427 --> 02:04.907
Judging by the blood trail,

02:04.907 --> 02:06.778
it looks like she tried
to make it out of the park.

02:06.778 --> 02:08.432
Didn't get very far.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.442
Dialed 9.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.879
Maybe trying to call for help.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.272
Witnesses?

02:22.272 --> 02:23.839
A park maintenance employee

02:23.839 --> 02:26.624
said he saw the victim arguing
with a guy in a long coat.

02:26.624 --> 02:28.800
He was a ways off, so he didn't
get race or age specifics.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.151
Just figured
it was a lovers' spat.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.717
Who found the body?

02:32.717 --> 02:35.242
Home team. Prosecutor.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.207
Counselor.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.296
She was a friend.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.299
Want to tell us
what happened?

02:49.299 --> 02:51.083
We were supposed to meet up.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.303
I hadn't seen her in months,

02:53.303 --> 02:55.479
but she called me this morning.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.568
Said she wanted my advice
about something.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.831
Did she mention
what it was about?

02:59.831 --> 03:02.138
No, she just said
it was complicated.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.226
When were you
supposed to meet?

03:03.226 --> 03:04.706
7:00.

03:04.706 --> 03:08.884
I was running late,
so I didn't get here till 7:30.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.407
I'm just gonna assume
that someone

03:10.407 --> 03:12.235
can verify your whereabouts
before then.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.497
Yeah.

03:15.673 --> 03:18.023
How'd you know her, Nolan?

03:18.023 --> 03:20.243
We worked side by side
at the public defender's office

03:20.243 --> 03:22.245
for three years.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.855
She was still
a public defender?

03:23.855 --> 03:25.205
Yeah.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.249
Long list of people
would want

03:26.249 --> 03:28.991
someone like that dead.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.559
Somebody like that?

03:31.559 --> 03:33.387
Sorry.
That came out wrong.

03:35.824 --> 03:39.523
Boy, did I put my foot
in my mouth there.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.612
More like both feet.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.228
Nothing suspicious
in the vic's apartment.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.447
She lived alone.

04:33.447 --> 04:34.970
No indication
of a significant other.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.319
- Murder weapon?
- Nope.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.103
No eyewitnesses.
Nothing on canvass either.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.714
What about next of kin?

04:39.714 --> 04:42.499
Her mom is coming up
from Baltimore now.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.762
Where was Rachel coming from
before she was killed?

04:44.762 --> 04:46.590
Work.
Public defender's office

04:46.590 --> 04:48.679
is five blocks
from Sutton Place Park.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.551
Vi, can we grab any footage

04:50.551 --> 04:52.248
and track her walk
from the office?

04:52.248 --> 04:54.337
Cameras are sparse
near the park,

04:54.337 --> 04:56.252
but I did pull something
from the security cams

04:56.252 --> 04:57.645
by her office.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.562
Guy's following Rachel.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.694
- Can you freeze that?
- That's a clean look.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.392
Any chance he's in the system?

05:05.392 --> 05:07.524
Checking now.

05:11.398 --> 05:14.314
Owen Bardo.
Yonkers address.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.317
Long sheet of violent priors.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.536
He's on trial for assault now.

05:19.536 --> 05:22.800
Guess
who his counsel of record is?

05:22.800 --> 05:24.715
Rachel Bender.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.763
<i>- Owen Bardo.
- Yeah.</i>

05:28.763 --> 05:32.114
NYPD.
We need a minute.

05:32.114 --> 05:34.159
When's the last time
you saw Rachel Bender?

05:34.159 --> 05:35.378
Yesterday evening.

05:35.378 --> 05:36.597
Why were you with her?

05:36.597 --> 05:38.642
Wait.
What's this about?

05:38.642 --> 05:41.079
This is about the fact
that your lawyer turned up dead

05:41.079 --> 05:44.126
after you were seen
following her yesterday.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.345
What?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.998
So why were you
following her?

05:46.998 --> 05:48.609
I wasn't.

05:48.609 --> 05:51.133
She asked me to sign
this affidavit for my case,

05:51.133 --> 05:52.439
so I was dropping it off.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.179
We didn't find her
with any affidavit.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.399
'Cause she said she was
on her way to meet a friend.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.183
Asked me
to bring it back later.

05:58.183 --> 05:59.489
How'd you two get along?

05:59.489 --> 06:02.057
We weren't best friends.
She was my lawyer.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.624
Where'd you go
after meeting with her?

06:03.624 --> 06:06.627
Straight to the Papaya King
right around the corner.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.498
I was there till 8:00.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.500
Look into it.
- We will.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.980
Look, she may
have had clients

06:11.980 --> 06:14.069
who didn't appreciate her,
but not me.

06:14.069 --> 06:16.245
When I caught up to her,
she was on the phone

06:16.245 --> 06:18.682
talking to someone about
getting a protective order.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.031
She even joked with me
about it.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.511
She said I don't have anything
to worry about.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.383
I'm not the guy
she's scared of.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.601
When was this?

06:24.601 --> 06:26.777
6:40, 6:45.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.174
<i>Only two detectives?</i>

06:32.174 --> 06:35.525
If it was an ADA, how many
would be assigned? Ten?

06:35.525 --> 06:37.875
Plus the press conferences,

06:37.875 --> 06:40.530
commissioner, mayor,
district attorney.

06:40.530 --> 06:44.099
But a dead public defender,
who cares, right?

06:44.099 --> 06:46.623
Well, I'm so happy you got
that off your chest, Manny.

06:46.623 --> 06:47.581
I hope you feel better.
- Just so you know,

06:47.581 --> 06:48.756
none of that is true.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.323
We investigate all cases
the same way.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.716
So how can I help you?

06:52.716 --> 06:54.196
We know Rachel called you
last night

06:54.196 --> 06:55.502
about a protective order.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.373
We just want to know
who she's afraid of.

06:57.373 --> 06:58.548
She didn't say.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.028
She just wanted to know
if it would

07:00.028 --> 07:02.639
cast the office in a bad light
if one of its lawyers

07:02.639 --> 07:04.902
was getting a protective order
for herself.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.078
I told her if she needed one,
she should get one.

07:07.078 --> 07:10.038
You know of any clients
she was having problems with?

07:10.038 --> 07:12.649
Don't know the details,
but I heard her talking

07:12.649 --> 07:14.738
about a recent
murder sentencing.

07:14.738 --> 07:15.913
She said she was scared.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.567
Thought someone
was gonna kill her.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.309
Don't know
if she was joking or not.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.311
Well, she wasn't.

07:22.311 --> 07:25.009
Do you have her calendar?

07:25.009 --> 07:27.621
I subbed in
for the sentencing.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.579
Rafael Cortez.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.494
Triple homicide.

07:31.494 --> 07:34.758
A dispute over drug proceeds.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.934
Guidelines left me
no flexibility.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.936
She have a problem
with her client?

07:38.936 --> 07:42.592
Problem was
with her client's son.

07:42.592 --> 07:45.726
He tried attacking Rachel.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.467
Called her a stupid bitch.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.686
Said it was all her fault.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.688
Court officers had
to hold him back.

07:51.688 --> 07:54.735
- Is he in the system now?
- No.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.214
I would have held him
in contempt,

07:56.214 --> 08:00.697
but Rachel said the family
had been through enough.

08:00.697 --> 08:03.221
I shouldn't have
listened to her.

08:05.528 --> 08:08.226
Yo, that's out!
That's out, bro!

08:08.226 --> 08:09.619
Let's go, baby!
You got it, fellas!

08:09.619 --> 08:10.794
Yo, who's got next?

08:10.794 --> 08:13.057
Luis Cortez,
we need a word.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.058
5-0! 5-0!

08:16.408 --> 08:17.932
Uh-uh.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.150
Almost.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.719
- I didn't do nothing.
- Yep.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.548
Why'd you run then?

08:25.548 --> 08:26.941
Give me your hand.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.246
Other hand.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.726
I got a gun.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.689
And a knife.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.865
I didn't do nothing!

08:43.479 --> 08:47.831
Now what's at 713 Van
Brunt Street, Red Hook, huh?

08:47.831 --> 08:50.530
That's
Rachel Bender's address.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.879
Well, well, well,

08:51.879 --> 08:53.924
looks like we need
to have a conversation.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.230
Stand up.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.802
What's with the arsenal?

09:01.802 --> 09:03.804
Man's got a right
to protect himself.

09:03.804 --> 09:04.848
I got enemies.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.589
Was Rachel Bender
one of them?

09:06.589 --> 09:08.809
It's that thing
in court, right?

09:08.809 --> 09:10.767
She should have
made my pops take a plea.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.726
He was gonna die in prison.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.337
You have any contact with
Rachel after that incident?

09:15.337 --> 09:18.601
No, but I saw my pops.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.168
He was pissed at me.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.691
Said I should apologize.

09:21.691 --> 09:24.259
Told me how much
she had done for him.

09:24.259 --> 09:27.479
I had her address 'cause
I sent roses to her apartment.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.133
Look it up.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.439
Where were you last night?

09:30.439 --> 09:33.007
Why? What's she saying?

09:33.007 --> 09:34.617
Nothing.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.837
Somebody killed her.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.316
No. No way.

09:38.316 --> 09:41.058
I was at my baby mama's house
in Bensonhurst, OK?

09:41.058 --> 09:42.538
Not OK.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.540
First, we're gonna
check out your story.

09:44.540 --> 09:45.454
And then you're
gonna have to answer

09:45.454 --> 09:47.021
for this gun in your bag.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.329
Luis Cortez's phone
puts him in Brooklyn

09:51.329 --> 09:52.592
at the time of Rachel's murder,

09:52.592 --> 09:54.811
but his knife is not a match
for the wound.

09:54.811 --> 09:57.205
His credit card confirms
that he sent Rachel flowers

09:57.205 --> 10:01.252
to her apartment
the day before she was killed.

10:01.252 --> 10:02.863
So back to the drawing board.

10:02.863 --> 10:05.082
Well, we've been working
our way through Rachel's cases,

10:05.082 --> 10:07.737
and it seems like all of her
clients with an ax to grind

10:07.737 --> 10:09.696
are either in prison
or alibi out.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.393
Anything back
from the crime lab?

10:11.393 --> 10:12.916
No DNA found on Rachel,

10:12.916 --> 10:15.745
but they were able
to ID that shoe imprint

10:15.745 --> 10:18.443
we found in the mud
next to her wallet.

10:18.443 --> 10:21.098
Size 11.
Very distinctive sole pattern.

10:21.098 --> 10:25.102
Pegs it as a Giovanni Presario.
High-end Italian loafer.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.234
Narrows it a little bit.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.718
Rachel's mom is here.

10:31.718 --> 10:35.591
Maybe she can help us
narrow it down even more.

10:35.591 --> 10:39.377
Rachel was so brilliant.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.727
I told her for years

10:40.727 --> 10:43.033
she should get paid
for her smarts

10:43.033 --> 10:47.995
by being in private practice, but...

10:47.995 --> 10:50.737
We're very sorry
for your loss, Ms. Bender.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.129
And we really appreciate
you coming in

10:52.129 --> 10:54.218
on this difficult day.

10:54.218 --> 10:58.570
Do you know
if Rachel was dating anyone?

10:58.570 --> 11:00.224
No, not seriously.

11:00.224 --> 11:03.097
Did she ever mention anybody
she was having a problem with?

11:03.097 --> 11:04.620
Like whom?

11:04.620 --> 11:06.230
Her clients,
for instance.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.799
Well, they were all problems.
They were criminals.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.801
We mean something irregular,

11:11.801 --> 11:14.282
like a threat
or a confrontation.

11:14.282 --> 11:17.241
Yeah, she did tell me

11:17.241 --> 11:20.505
about an altercation
she had last Friday

11:20.505 --> 11:23.117
with a restaurant
in The Village

11:23.117 --> 11:24.684
named Luchardi's.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.295
- Did she say with whom?
- No.

11:27.295 --> 11:31.473
But she was really shaken up.

11:31.473 --> 11:33.257
Said she was never going back.

11:37.653 --> 11:38.785
<i>Rachel was a regular.</i>

11:38.785 --> 11:40.351
She always ordered
a caprese salad.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.744
I understand
there was an incident with her

11:41.744 --> 11:42.745
last time she was in.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.791
Yeah, it was nutty.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.662
Rachel was over
by the bathroom.

11:46.662 --> 11:49.056
A guy is sitting,
drinking at the bar.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.319
He sees her.
Starts screaming.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.450
About what?

11:52.450 --> 11:53.800
I didn't hear
the nitty gritty.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.149
I got between them quick, though.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.498
I showed 'em the door.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.369
- He follow her?
- I couldn't tell you.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.675
I was short-staffed that day.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.111
I had a delivery to attend to.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.809
I didn't even know Rachel
was there until I saw her.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.985
- Do you remember the guy?
- Yeah.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.814
Scraggly hairs.
Big, white guy.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.467
You think you could find
his credit card receipt?

12:09.467 --> 12:11.034
Maybe give us a name?
- Sure.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.823
- Adam Grassley?
- Yeah?

12:16.823 --> 12:18.259
Mr. Grassley,
we're police detectives.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.348
May we come in
and ask you a few questions?

12:20.348 --> 12:22.480
No.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.700
OK, would you like
to step outside,

12:24.700 --> 12:26.484
and we can have a conversation?

12:26.484 --> 12:31.054
Why don't you take your toy
badges and get off my porch?

12:32.055 --> 12:33.840
Sir, have you been drinking?

12:33.840 --> 12:36.277
- It's a free country.
- Yes, it is.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.844
And that's why
we're gonna cut you some slack

12:37.844 --> 12:39.628
for getting so mouthy with us.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.282
We're just gonna ask you
a few questions.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.588
You're gonna cut me slack?

12:43.588 --> 12:45.286
You guys are on my property...
- Easy.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.244
And you're gonna
tell me what to do?

12:47.244 --> 12:48.202
- Easy, Grassley.
- Hey.

12:50.639 --> 12:51.814
I didn't do any--

12:51.814 --> 12:54.077
Get off of me!
- Hey.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.949
You wanted us
off your property?

12:55.949 --> 12:58.386
It's your lucky day, buddy.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.257
You're coming with us.

13:01.389 --> 13:04.218
What's your beef
with Rachel Bender?

13:04.218 --> 13:06.829
So that's what this is about,
that piece of garbage?

13:06.829 --> 13:10.311
Hey. You've had plenty
of time to sober up, buddy,

13:10.311 --> 13:13.749
so do yourself a favor
and answer our questions.

13:18.188 --> 13:21.017
My 16-year-old daughter
was raped and murdered

13:21.017 --> 13:23.280
by one of her clients in July.

13:25.108 --> 13:28.155
And Bender got him
acquitted last week

13:28.155 --> 13:32.202
'cause of a warrantless search
by meathead cops.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.467
That's terrible.

13:36.467 --> 13:37.904
I have a teenage daughter myself.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.341
I can't imagine the pain
you're going through.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.952
I'm sorry for your loss.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.173
I just wanted to ask her,
like, how...

13:48.915 --> 13:51.352
How do you represent
such a vile human being?

13:51.352 --> 13:53.745
She wouldn't answer my calls.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.573
Then I ran into her.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.401
You have
any further interactions?

13:57.401 --> 13:58.794
Why?

13:58.794 --> 14:00.970
Someone killed her.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.716
Is this where I'm supposed
to say karma's a bitch?

14:07.716 --> 14:10.458
No, I didn't do it.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.374
It's like I told her boyfriend.
I said my piece.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.679
Boyfriend?

14:14.679 --> 14:16.812
When did you talk
to her boyfriend?

14:16.812 --> 14:18.640
Luchardi's.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.685
Guy follows me into the street

14:20.685 --> 14:22.122
screaming at me
to leave her alone.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.864
Almost knocked his ass out too.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.561
But I didn't.

14:26.561 --> 14:29.477
Instead, I just went
to the bar across the street

14:29.477 --> 14:32.306
and kept drinking.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.924
Went through Rachel's emails
again, texts, phone calls.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.187
There's no sign
she was dating anyone.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.841
Maybe the relationship
was on the down-low.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.887
Maybe the guy is married.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.672
As for her dating pool, there
are 200 males at her office.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.500
Factor in full-timers
at the courthouse,

14:52.500 --> 14:53.675
guys who come in and out.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.111
Jeez, we're gonna
need an abacus.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.070
They had to be out and about
a little bit, right?

14:57.070 --> 14:59.289
Vi, dig back
into Rachel's credit cards.

14:59.289 --> 15:03.641
Look for hotels, restaurants,
bed and breakfasts.

15:03.641 --> 15:05.600
There's not too much.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.255
But there were three charges
last month

15:08.255 --> 15:11.606
from a café in The Village
called Java Bliss.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.129
They were all before 6:30 a.m.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.262
And the last one was Saturday.
- For an espresso?

15:15.262 --> 15:17.264
That's a long way to go
for a girl from Red Hook.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.613
You know,
I don't know about you guys,

15:18.613 --> 15:21.311
but if I end up
in a different borough

15:21.311 --> 15:24.706
stumbling into a coffee shop
at that time of the morning...

15:24.706 --> 15:25.663
It's 'cause
you've just spent the night

15:25.663 --> 15:27.361
at someone's apartment.

15:27.361 --> 15:28.666
Reach out to Java Bliss.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.886
See if they've got
security cameras.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.459
<i>We need to speak
to Judge Raymer.</i>

15:38.459 --> 15:40.548
He's busy.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.071
You can't go in there.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.855
Francis versus Grace--

15:43.855 --> 15:45.770
What the hell
are you doing here?

15:45.770 --> 15:46.989
Judge, we're executing
a search warrant.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.860
I am in the middle
of a conference.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.124
Well, your conference
is now continued.

15:51.124 --> 15:53.648
Gentlemen, if you please.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.828
Rachel Bender?
Is this a joke?

15:59.828 --> 16:02.004
It most certainly is not.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.963
What's the probable cause?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.660
We have an eyewitness
who works at a coffee shop

16:05.660 --> 16:09.011
near your home who places you
in the coffee shop Saturday

16:09.011 --> 16:10.708
having a heated argument
with Rachel

16:10.708 --> 16:12.232
because
she wouldn't take you back.

16:12.232 --> 16:15.017
You need to get
the hell out of there now.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.932
Judge?

16:16.932 --> 16:18.934
Is that a cut
in your right hand?

16:20.283 --> 16:22.111
You have no idea

16:22.111 --> 16:24.026
the dimensions
of the mistake you're making.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.506
We are making no mistakes.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.073
We just got a text
from a detective

16:27.073 --> 16:29.205
executing warrant
at your house.

16:29.205 --> 16:33.296
They found a pair of size 11
Giovanni Presario loafers

16:33.296 --> 16:35.951
in your closet,
mud still on the sole.

16:35.951 --> 16:38.388
Matches the footprint
at the crime scene.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.913
- Turn around.
- I'm not gonna turn around.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.264
You're seriously handcuffing me
in my chamber?

16:44.264 --> 16:46.005
Hey!

16:46.005 --> 16:50.009
You are under arrest for
the murder of Rachel Bender.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.932
I've been waiting 20 minutes
for a cup of coffee.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.891
Judge,
you know how this works.

17:02.891 --> 17:05.241
You've been in this business
a very long time,

17:05.241 --> 17:07.635
so we're gonna
shoot you straight.

17:07.635 --> 17:10.029
The evidence against you
is very strong.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.944
We got your fancy size 11
loafers at the crime scene.

17:12.944 --> 17:15.338
You got a cut on the palm
of your right hand,

17:15.338 --> 17:16.513
the stabbing hand.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.124
And a man matching
your description

17:18.124 --> 17:20.561
was seen arguing
with our vic

17:20.561 --> 17:22.606
shortly before
she was murdered.

17:22.606 --> 17:25.305
Plus we have motive.

17:25.305 --> 17:29.570
The victim dumps your ass a few
days before she was murdered.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.963
Get out ahead of this, Judge.

17:31.963 --> 17:34.575
Tell us your side of the story.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.753
You want me to confess.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.320
Please.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.800
I had nothing to do
with Rachel's death.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.715
So uncuff me right now,

17:44.715 --> 17:47.240
and I'll pretend
that this was nothing more

17:47.240 --> 17:49.416
than an ill-informed error
of judgment--

17:49.416 --> 17:53.028
a simple but stupid mistake.

17:53.028 --> 17:55.726
That's not the way
to play this.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.426
Your Honor.

18:02.559 --> 18:06.259
I want a lawyer now.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.401
Judge Raymer?

18:18.401 --> 18:19.924
Hard to believe, I know.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.448
The facts say what they say.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.450
No, I agree he's our man.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.930
But I reviewed the file.

18:25.930 --> 18:29.108
Evidence is solid,
except it's all circumstantial.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.023
Is there anyone else
who can help nail this down?

18:32.023 --> 18:34.243
Add some context
to Raymer's personality,

18:34.243 --> 18:36.376
or better yet,
provide some more evidence?

18:36.376 --> 18:37.681
There may be.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.901
Raymer called his law clerk
at 5:40

18:39.901 --> 18:41.903
the night
that Rachel was killed.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.513
That's less than two hours
before the murder.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.820
Which is why we're on our way
to talk to him now.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.126
I'm coming with you.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.129
Are you sure about that?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.391
I am.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.658
<i>No, that's impossible.</i>

18:57.658 --> 18:59.399
Judge Raymer
would never hurt anybody.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.488
We appreciate
your loyalty, Tyler.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.881
We just have a few questions,
and we'll be on our way.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.535
Did you know
about his relationship

19:05.535 --> 19:06.797
with Rachel Bender?

19:06.797 --> 19:08.103
No.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.887
Why did Raymer
call you at 5:40

19:09.887 --> 19:11.628
the night Rachel was killed?

19:11.628 --> 19:12.934
I was grabbing a slice

19:12.934 --> 19:14.892
across the street
from the courthouse.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.720
I drive the judge
to and from work.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.158
He wanted me to take him home.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.290
- Is that what you did?
- Yes.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.074
I drove him to his place
in The Village,

19:23.074 --> 19:24.902
then came up
and worked on an opinion.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.949
I was with him till about 9:00.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.385
Wait, hold on.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.300
You're telling us that
you were at your boss' house

19:31.300 --> 19:33.737
for three hours
that night with him?

19:33.737 --> 19:35.217
Yes.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.959
Wow, your judge,
what a lucky guy.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.917
You just handed him
the perfect alibi.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.355
Hey, guys,
could you give us a minute?

19:48.839 --> 19:51.102
Yeah, I was a clerk
back in the day.

19:51.102 --> 19:54.889
I know
what your boss means to you.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.934
Judge Raymer
is a brilliant man.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.893
Is a good man.
- No.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.287
I felt the same way
about Judge Munson.

20:01.287 --> 20:04.246
And I wouldn't change
that experience for anything,

20:04.246 --> 20:06.553
even though the hours
were really long

20:06.553 --> 20:08.468
and I felt like
an indentured servant.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.081
Nothing's changed
in that regard.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.996
Trust me.
- No, I know.

20:14.996 --> 20:17.041
Some things will never change,
no matter what.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.262
But here's the thing, Tyler.

20:20.262 --> 20:25.093
Indentured servants don't
socialize with their bosses.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.138
Excuse me?

20:27.138 --> 20:29.445
You lied about being
with Judge Raymer

20:29.445 --> 20:32.318
at his place
on the night Rachel was killed.

20:34.145 --> 20:37.323
Did you know they were dating?

20:37.323 --> 20:39.150
I suspected.

20:39.150 --> 20:42.502
She came by the chambers a lot.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.853
And then last week,
I heard raised voices.

20:46.984 --> 20:50.074
She dumped him.

20:50.074 --> 20:53.034
And where did you
drop him that night?

20:54.122 --> 20:56.037
Public defender's office.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.040
Why?

20:59.040 --> 21:01.999
Because he said
he had business.

21:01.999 --> 21:05.307
I know he had
a contentious divorce, right?

21:05.307 --> 21:08.223
But he would
never hurt Rachel, OK?

21:08.223 --> 21:09.877
That's not who he is.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.844
I already spoke
to the detectives.

21:20.844 --> 21:24.152
My ex-husband
is a powerful man.

21:24.152 --> 21:27.155
I'm not comfortable saying
anything else about him.

21:27.155 --> 21:30.332
Respectfully, Ms. Raymer,
he's on trial for murder.

21:30.332 --> 21:34.162
Your comfort is not
our chief concern.

21:34.162 --> 21:37.121
You filed a restraining order
against him.

21:37.121 --> 21:40.299
Why don't you tell us
what your ex-husband did?

21:42.388 --> 21:47.131
What he did was stalk me
after I moved out.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.219
Hit me.

21:49.395 --> 21:52.615
Said if I left him,
he would kill me.

21:53.747 --> 21:56.402
Well, then why did you decide
not to pursue charges?

21:56.402 --> 21:57.577
He's a judge.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.970
It would have been
my word against his.

21:59.970 --> 22:03.409
Plus, there's no alimony
if your ex is behind bars.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.454
If I testify against him--

22:05.454 --> 22:09.850
Ms. Raymer, a woman is dead.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.765
And he has to be
held responsible.

22:11.765 --> 22:14.376
So we are gonna subpoena you.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.291
And if you won't testify,

22:16.291 --> 22:18.554
I will seek
to hold you in contempt.

22:18.554 --> 22:19.903
Do you understand?

22:25.605 --> 22:27.084
<i>Mr. Price is attempting</i>

22:27.084 --> 22:29.913
to introduce Ms. Raymer's
testimony as a prior bad act.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.393
Goes to pattern, Your Honor.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.873
There is no pattern.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.832
Ms. Raymer is not dead.
- Judge, please.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.617
Can we call this
for what it is:

22:37.617 --> 22:41.055
a shameless ploy to poison
the jury against my client

22:41.055 --> 22:43.100
to cover for the prosecution's
lack of evidence?

22:43.100 --> 22:45.233
The defendant's penchant
for stalking women

22:45.233 --> 22:47.409
and committing acts of violence
is highly relevant

22:47.409 --> 22:49.063
to this trial.
- Enough.

22:49.063 --> 22:51.544
The probative value
of the testimony sought here

22:51.544 --> 22:55.025
is clearly outweighed
by its prejudicial impact.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.418
I'm precluding it.

22:56.418 --> 22:59.160
Anything else, Mr. Price?

23:00.683 --> 23:05.906
Mr. Price, do you mind telling
me what you're staring at?

23:05.906 --> 23:09.126
A photo of you
and the defendant.

23:09.126 --> 23:10.824
Yes.
We went to Harvard together.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.129
I knew that.

23:12.129 --> 23:16.482
I just didn't realize
how close you were.

23:16.482 --> 23:20.573
Is there something
you'd like to say, Counselor?

23:20.573 --> 23:23.314
Yes, respectfully,

23:23.314 --> 23:25.926
the victim's family
and the press

23:25.926 --> 23:28.450
could misconstrue

23:28.450 --> 23:31.192
your relationship
with the defendant.

23:31.192 --> 23:33.324
And the people have no choice

23:33.324 --> 23:37.590
but to move for your immediate
recusal in this matter.

23:37.590 --> 23:38.982
We oppose.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.245
This is a bald-faced attempt
at judge-shopping.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.204
No, it's worse than that.

23:43.204 --> 23:47.077
It's an unfounded attack on
the integrity of my courtroom.

23:47.077 --> 23:48.992
And I won't stand for it.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.167
Motion denied.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.953
- Judge Benning--
- Denied.

23:52.953 --> 23:55.477
Openings tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.479
Goodbye, Mr. Price.

23:57.479 --> 24:00.047
- Thank you, Judge.
- Thank you, Judge.

24:04.399 --> 24:09.535
Judges have an immense amount
of power in the courtroom.

24:09.535 --> 24:12.581
Outside of the courtroom,
that power is circumscribed,

24:12.581 --> 24:15.497
like it is for every one of us.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.413
This is a story

24:18.413 --> 24:23.331
of a judge who would not
accept those limits.

24:23.331 --> 24:26.290
The evidence will show
that the victim

24:26.290 --> 24:29.032
ended her relationship
with the defendant,

24:29.032 --> 24:32.253
rejected his desperate attempt
to reconcile,

24:32.253 --> 24:37.388
and so, he hunted her down
and stabbed her to death

24:37.388 --> 24:43.960
in a brutal and deranged
exercise of power

24:43.960 --> 24:47.311
and one he has to answer for.

24:48.661 --> 24:52.273
This case is about power--

24:52.273 --> 24:55.406
the prosecution's abuse of it.

24:55.406 --> 24:58.148
Because Mr. Price is twisting
a simple breakup

24:58.148 --> 25:00.542
into a fantasy of murder.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.979
Why do this
on what will become clear

25:02.979 --> 25:05.721
is a flimsy
evidentiary foundation

25:05.721 --> 25:08.550
to eliminate an enemy--

25:08.550 --> 25:10.509
Mr. Price's enemy?

25:10.509 --> 25:13.337
Because Mr. Price
has been on the wrong end

25:13.337 --> 25:16.210
of Judge Raymer's rulings
over and over.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.473
Objection. Foundation.
Move to strike.

25:18.473 --> 25:21.171
Overruled.
Sit down, Mr. Price.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.565
And don't interrupt again.

25:23.565 --> 25:26.916
At the end of the
prosecution's so-called case,

25:26.916 --> 25:29.179
I will ask you
to send a message:

25:29.179 --> 25:31.573
that the judiciary
is independent

25:31.573 --> 25:33.227
and can't be intimidated.

25:33.227 --> 25:36.578
I will ask you
to acquit Judge Raymer

25:36.578 --> 25:39.450
of this baseless charge.

25:42.062 --> 25:45.631
I manufactured the case
to eliminate an enemy?

25:45.631 --> 25:49.330
It's offensive on its face
and sanctionable.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.985
So then there's no truth
to Strawn's contention

25:51.985 --> 25:53.552
that you've been
on the losing side

25:53.552 --> 25:55.902
of a majority
of Raymer's rulings?

25:55.902 --> 25:57.512
Well, of course there is,

25:57.512 --> 26:00.384
like every other prosecutor
in the building.

26:00.384 --> 26:03.039
Raymer is notoriously
pro-defense.

26:03.039 --> 26:04.737
Then the defendant
is entitled

26:04.737 --> 26:08.610
to make the argument that
Raymer's bias stoked yours.

26:08.610 --> 26:12.614
Speaking of Benning's bias,
if you'd asked me,

26:12.614 --> 26:16.400
I would have argued
against that motion to recuse.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.707
He's compromised, Jack,
and his prejudice

26:18.707 --> 26:21.318
will manifest itself
in ways big and small

26:21.318 --> 26:23.494
throughout the trial,
even if it's unconscious.

26:23.494 --> 26:27.150
Maybe,
but you're seasoned enough

26:27.150 --> 26:30.066
to know that any judge
who admits to being partial

26:30.066 --> 26:32.460
is acknowledging his failings.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.462
Your motion
didn't stand a chance.

26:34.462 --> 26:37.944
All it did was infuriate him.

26:37.944 --> 26:41.208
Defense counsel suggested
I'm framing his client.

26:41.208 --> 26:43.645
The trial judge is pals
with the defendant.

26:43.645 --> 26:47.649
I think I was expecting you to
share in a bit of my outrage.

26:47.649 --> 26:50.652
Our outrage isn't gonna
convince the jury of anything.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.480
Feeding them evidence is.

26:52.480 --> 26:55.048
I suggest you focus
your energies on that.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.884
At some point, Mr. Minter,
did you become aware

27:04.884 --> 27:06.146
that the defendant
and Ms. Bender

27:06.146 --> 27:09.062
were engaged in a relationship?
- Yes.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.977
When did you
become aware of that?

27:10.977 --> 27:13.109
When I overheard them
talking in chambers.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.764
And what was the substance
of their conversation?

27:15.764 --> 27:18.506
It was about...

27:18.506 --> 27:19.899
the relationship.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.683
Mm-hmm.

27:21.683 --> 27:24.817
Do you recall overhearing
that Miss Bender wanted

27:24.817 --> 27:26.862
to end that relationship?

27:30.431 --> 27:33.564
I don't remember
overhearing that.

27:35.088 --> 27:38.395
What do you remember
overhearing?

27:38.395 --> 27:39.614
Not much.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.181
The walls are thick.

27:41.181 --> 27:42.661
Well, which is it,
Mr. Minter?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.663
You don't remember the victim
telling the defendant

27:44.663 --> 27:48.014
she wanted to break up,
or you couldn't hear the victim

27:48.014 --> 27:50.016
telling the defendant
she wanted to break up?

27:50.016 --> 27:52.671
Both, I guess.

27:55.238 --> 27:58.633
Did you
or did you not inform me

27:58.633 --> 28:01.592
that you heard the victim
break up with the defendant?

28:01.592 --> 28:04.073
I said no such thing.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.903
All right.
Let's move on.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.082
Did you drop the defendant off
outside Ms. Bender's office

28:13.082 --> 28:16.651
shortly before
she was stabbed to death?

28:16.651 --> 28:18.392
No, I dropped him off
at his apartment

28:18.392 --> 28:20.263
and worked on a case with him
for three hours.

28:20.263 --> 28:23.484
You told me
you dropped the defendant off

28:23.484 --> 28:25.399
outside
Ms. Bender's place of work

28:25.399 --> 28:27.749
shortly before she was killed, correct?

28:27.749 --> 28:29.359
I don't recall.

28:29.359 --> 28:31.492
Mr. Minter, did you
discuss your testimony

28:31.492 --> 28:34.060
with the defendant in advance
of your appearance here today?

28:34.060 --> 28:35.409
- No.
- Yet suddenly,

28:35.409 --> 28:37.890
you are contradicting
everything you told me?

28:37.890 --> 28:39.021
- That's not true.
- All right.

28:39.021 --> 28:40.370
Will the court
please remind Mr. Minter

28:40.370 --> 28:43.069
that he is testifying
under penalty of perjury?

28:43.069 --> 28:44.418
Objection.

28:44.418 --> 28:46.637
Asked and answered. Badgering.

28:46.637 --> 28:49.292
If the prosecution doesn't like
Mr. Minter's testimony,

28:49.292 --> 28:51.381
they shouldn't have called him.
- Sustained.

28:51.381 --> 28:54.080
The witness' testimony
is clear.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.777
You're done here, Mr. Price.

28:55.777 --> 28:58.171
Your witness, Mr. Strawn.

28:58.171 --> 29:01.435
We have nothing,
Judge Benning.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.619
You were right.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.926
Raymer clearly had a chat
with Minter.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.449
Called him early this morning.

29:15.449 --> 29:18.234
Conversation lasted
an hour and a half.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.975
Kid's always been shaky.

29:19.975 --> 29:21.803
Well, we can open
a perjury investigation.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.197
No, there's no point.
We couldn't prove it.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.155
And even if we could,
he's been completely burned

29:26.155 --> 29:27.722
as a witness.

29:27.722 --> 29:30.420
- Nolan Price?
- Yes.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.989
Thank you.

29:35.948 --> 29:37.123
What's that?

29:38.472 --> 29:41.997
It's a subpoena
for my testimony.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.784
I discovered
the victim's body.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.960
The defense is entitled
to inquire about that

29:47.960 --> 29:49.178
and nothing else.

29:49.178 --> 29:50.745
Says Mr. Price.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.094
We're entitled to inquire

29:52.094 --> 29:54.183
about his private conversation
with Mr. Minter.

29:54.183 --> 29:55.837
It's called
interviewing a witness.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.665
Yes, with no one else present

29:57.665 --> 29:59.885
and referencing
that conversation repeatedly

29:59.885 --> 30:01.625
during
Mr. Minter's questioning.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.453
You could have objected
to those references.

30:03.453 --> 30:04.541
You did not.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.674
But it's part
of the record now,

30:06.674 --> 30:08.589
making you a party
to a conversation

30:08.589 --> 30:10.765
that is central
to the outcome of this case,

30:10.765 --> 30:12.593
whether you like it or not.
- Your Honor--

30:12.593 --> 30:14.334
As someone
who is so concerned

30:14.334 --> 30:16.205
with the appearance
of impropriety,

30:16.205 --> 30:17.816
Mr. Price,
you, of all people,

30:17.816 --> 30:20.514
should know that it would
be highly improper of me

30:20.514 --> 30:22.298
to deprive the defense
the opportunity

30:22.298 --> 30:25.301
to impeach your testimony.

30:25.301 --> 30:27.564
Mr. Price will take the stand.

30:32.047 --> 30:35.224
Mr. Price, how often have you
appeared before Judge Raymer?

30:35.224 --> 30:37.009
Perhaps a half dozen times.

30:37.009 --> 30:38.837
Eight, actually.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.143
And you've lost three
of those cases, right?

30:41.143 --> 30:44.190
Yes,
but they were jury verdicts.

30:44.190 --> 30:45.539
Each of which involved

30:45.539 --> 30:48.585
numerous motions crucial
to the case's outcome--

30:48.585 --> 30:49.891
motions you lost.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.284
Objection. Relevance.

30:51.284 --> 30:52.894
Make your point, Mr. Strawn.

30:52.894 --> 30:56.245
You dislike appearing
before Judge Raymer.

30:56.245 --> 31:00.902
No, I have no animus towards
Judge Raymer as a judge.

31:00.902 --> 31:04.732
I do, however, despise him
for the heinous act

31:04.732 --> 31:06.777
the evidence establishes
he committed.

31:06.777 --> 31:09.476
You and the victim,
Rachel Bender,

31:09.476 --> 31:11.521
were colleagues
at the public defender's office

31:11.521 --> 31:13.915
for three years.
- Yes.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.090
At the time of her death,

31:15.090 --> 31:16.700
were you two
romantically involved?

31:16.700 --> 31:18.398
- No.
- Objection. Relevance.

31:18.398 --> 31:19.921
A little latitude, Judge.

31:19.921 --> 31:22.228
I'll allow it.

31:22.228 --> 31:24.926
I'd like to offer
the following photo

31:24.926 --> 31:27.624
as defense exhibit 34.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.373
Judge, may we approach?

31:42.335 --> 31:44.598
Mr. Price's past relationship
with the victim

31:44.598 --> 31:47.122
has absolutely nothing
to do with this case.

31:47.122 --> 31:48.384
But it has everything to do

31:48.384 --> 31:50.604
with his decision
to bring this case.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.693
Mr. Price's relationship
with Ms. Bender

31:52.693 --> 31:55.391
establishes prosecutorial
overreach and bias.

31:55.391 --> 31:56.958
I'll allow it.
Step back.

31:56.958 --> 32:00.179
- Judge--
- Ms. Maroun, step back.

32:00.179 --> 32:03.399
Mark it as defense exhibit 34.

32:03.399 --> 32:04.835
You can put it up.

32:08.404 --> 32:11.668
Mr. Price, can you tell us
what this photo depicts?

32:11.668 --> 32:13.366
It's an office holiday party.

32:13.366 --> 32:15.846
I think it was 2012.

32:15.846 --> 32:19.633
It's a photo of you
kissing Rachel Bender, right?

32:19.633 --> 32:20.721
That's correct.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.679
So let me
rephrase my question.

32:22.679 --> 32:26.205
Did you ever have a romantic
relationship with Ms. Bender?

32:26.205 --> 32:28.207
A brief one.
Decade ago.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.035
But you still loved her, correct?

32:30.035 --> 32:33.995
No, I was never
in love with her.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.563
And you hated the fact
Judge Raymer was dating her.

32:36.563 --> 32:38.130
Objection.
This is preposterous.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.740
Overruled.

32:39.740 --> 32:42.525
There were no witnesses to
Ms. Bender's killing, correct?

32:42.525 --> 32:44.179
None that we've located.

32:44.179 --> 32:45.746
But you're the one
that found the body.

32:45.746 --> 32:50.533
Your fingerprints were
on her driver's license.

32:50.533 --> 32:51.665
How do we know
you didn't kill her?

32:51.665 --> 32:53.014
- Objection.
- How do we know

32:53.014 --> 32:55.147
this entire trial
isn't a frame job

32:55.147 --> 32:56.800
by a jealous man
who killed the lover

32:56.800 --> 32:58.846
he was still obsessed with?
- Judge, please.

32:58.846 --> 33:00.717
And the man you're framing
was also ruling against you

33:00.717 --> 33:02.197
in case after case--
a two-for-one deal, right?

33:02.197 --> 33:03.372
Objection.

33:03.372 --> 33:06.288
Sustained.
Enough, Mr. Strawn.

33:06.288 --> 33:07.942
Nothing further.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.697
You think
it might have dawned on you

33:23.697 --> 33:25.351
to inform co-counsel the victim
was an ex-girlfriend?

33:25.351 --> 33:29.442
It was a casual thing, Sam.
It was more than a decade ago.

33:29.442 --> 33:32.619
You went after Benning
because he's Raymer's friend.

33:32.619 --> 33:34.621
You are just as compromised
as he is.

33:34.621 --> 33:39.104
Look, I am sorry I didn't
bring you into the loop,

33:39.104 --> 33:41.584
but it was irrelevant.

33:41.584 --> 33:45.849
Well, that may be true,
but we're on life support.

33:45.849 --> 33:47.938
I mean,
the jury may not believe

33:47.938 --> 33:49.114
you framed Raymer
for the murder,

33:49.114 --> 33:51.333
but they could believe
you overreached,

33:51.333 --> 33:54.641
that you are not
seeing things clearly.

33:54.641 --> 33:56.121
We need more evidence.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.687
I agree.

34:00.995 --> 34:03.911
Maybe we take another run
at Tyler Minter.

34:03.911 --> 34:05.434
His testimony is useless.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.001
You said it yourself.
- I know.

34:07.001 --> 34:11.397
But he seems to know more
about Raymer than anybody else.

34:20.319 --> 34:21.407
I'm not talking.

34:21.407 --> 34:22.973
I believe
in Judge Raymer's innocence.

34:22.973 --> 34:24.584
He's gonna be acquitted,
and he'll be back on the bench

34:24.584 --> 34:26.673
in a week.
- I understand the sentiment.

34:26.673 --> 34:31.721
But you will have
to pay a price for it.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.201
Excuse me?

34:33.201 --> 34:34.855
You're still relatively new
to the legal profession,

34:34.855 --> 34:35.943
so let me educate you.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.771
This is a murder trial,

34:37.771 --> 34:41.992
and you lied on the stand.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.038
I can't allow that
to go unchecked.

34:44.038 --> 34:48.999
Y-you're gonna indict me?

34:48.999 --> 34:51.001
You'll never prove it.

34:51.001 --> 34:53.787
Maybe.

34:53.787 --> 34:58.139
But are you really willing
to take that risk?

34:58.139 --> 35:01.055
Tyler,
if you don't talk to us,

35:01.055 --> 35:03.405
you're gonna force our hand.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.677
You told me you didn't know

35:14.677 --> 35:16.418
why Judge Raymer wanted
to be dropped off

35:16.418 --> 35:17.724
at the public defender's office

35:17.724 --> 35:21.423
on the day
that Rachel was killed.

35:21.423 --> 35:23.295
That's not true, is it?

35:28.430 --> 35:30.171
The judge...

35:33.174 --> 35:34.828
He bought a diamond ring.

35:34.828 --> 35:37.309
He was gonna propose to her
in Dewey Park.

35:37.309 --> 35:40.747
It's a block from
the public defender's office.

35:40.747 --> 35:44.620
It's where they had
their first date.

35:44.620 --> 35:45.839
Can I go?

35:52.889 --> 35:55.457
So we got the proposal.

35:55.457 --> 35:57.459
Problem is what comes next.

35:57.459 --> 36:00.723
The street vendor stops his
cart right in front of them.

36:00.723 --> 36:02.160
Obstructs the view.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.817
By the time
the cart moves again,

36:07.817 --> 36:09.776
Raymer is storming off.

36:09.776 --> 36:13.127
So Raymer thinks he can get
her back by proposing to her.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.694
She turns him down flat.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.261
He stews over it.

36:16.261 --> 36:18.872
An hour later,
she's dead two blocks away.

36:18.872 --> 36:21.614
But there is a guy
standing right behind him.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.442
He had to have seen
the whole thing.

36:23.442 --> 36:25.748
Yeah, maybe he can
provide some context

36:25.748 --> 36:27.446
and fill in some of the gaps
for the jury.

36:27.446 --> 36:28.882
Can you zoom in
on his jacket?

36:34.931 --> 36:37.456
Yeah, I was on my break
having a smoke.

36:37.456 --> 36:38.935
Saw the guy flame out.

36:38.935 --> 36:41.416
Can you run through
what you saw, Drew?

36:41.416 --> 36:44.071
It was pretty quick.
He got down on one knee.

36:44.071 --> 36:46.247
She said, sorry,
but it was over.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.249
He gets up.
Starts screaming at her.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.642
Anything else?

36:49.642 --> 36:52.079
Yeah, the last thing
he said stuck with me.

36:52.079 --> 36:53.907
He said she would be sorry.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.778
Told her he was gonna get her.

36:57.258 --> 36:59.173
I appreciate you, brother.

36:59.173 --> 37:01.480
We'll be in touch.
- Sure thing.

37:01.480 --> 37:05.310
Yo, the guy was a real prick.
- Mm.

37:07.529 --> 37:10.576
How's the doorman's
trial prep going?

37:10.576 --> 37:13.187
Afraid we've hit a snag.

37:13.187 --> 37:14.319
What do you mean?

37:14.319 --> 37:15.711
He's got a prior conviction

37:15.711 --> 37:18.192
for harassing an ex-girlfriend.

37:18.192 --> 37:20.281
Pled guilty in 2015.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.936
The defense could spin this
to its advantage

37:22.936 --> 37:25.852
and turn him
into an obsessive predator

37:25.852 --> 37:27.767
who met the victim
right before she was murdered.

37:27.767 --> 37:31.031
Make it look like
he's the killer.

37:33.512 --> 37:35.601
Not if we don't use him.

37:35.601 --> 37:38.952
Look, the Java Bliss barista.

37:38.952 --> 37:41.302
Plus, we have the cut
on Raymer's right palm

37:41.302 --> 37:42.695
and his shoes
at the crime scene.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.000
And the jury
will put it together.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.655
But we still have
to turn over information

37:46.655 --> 37:48.222
about Drew to the defense.

37:48.222 --> 37:50.790
It's not our job
to present alternative theories

37:50.790 --> 37:51.965
to the defense.

37:51.965 --> 37:54.446
No, but it is our job

37:54.446 --> 37:56.317
to turn over
exculpatory evidence.

37:56.317 --> 37:59.320
You really think that there
is a reasonable probability

37:59.320 --> 38:02.715
that this information would
result in a different verdict?

38:02.715 --> 38:06.588
Is that opinion based
on your legal interpretation

38:06.588 --> 38:11.027
or your desire
to get justice for your friend?

38:11.027 --> 38:12.115
Both.

38:12.115 --> 38:13.247
Well, what would you say

38:13.247 --> 38:14.814
if you were still
a defense attorney?

38:18.078 --> 38:21.211
It doesn't matter.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.691
I'm a prosecutor.

38:27.305 --> 38:31.526
It's my call, Sam.

38:46.019 --> 38:47.716
Thank you, Hannah.

38:55.202 --> 38:56.812
Any word on the jury?

38:56.812 --> 38:59.989
No. It's been two days, so...

38:59.989 --> 39:02.514
I just hope your passion
for the victim

39:02.514 --> 39:05.952
doesn't cloud
their assessment of the facts.

39:05.952 --> 39:09.259
I did what I thought
was right for the case

39:09.259 --> 39:11.610
and for Rachel's family.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.960
Winning the case
is what's right.

39:13.960 --> 39:18.138
And we have 20 other
homicide prosecutors here

39:18.138 --> 39:19.139
who could have handled--

39:19.139 --> 39:20.880
But I'm the best.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.099
And you know it.

39:23.099 --> 39:26.407
What you are is compromised.

39:26.407 --> 39:31.020
If I had known
you found the victim's body

39:31.020 --> 39:32.631
and you slept with her,

39:32.631 --> 39:35.982
I wouldn't have let you
within a time zone of this!

39:35.982 --> 39:37.810
I took this on because

39:37.810 --> 39:41.944
I thought I could maximize
the chance of a conviction.

39:41.944 --> 39:46.384
Because you cared so deeply
for the victim.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.907
Correct.

39:47.907 --> 39:50.213
I rest my case.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.437
Jury's back.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.495
<i>Counsel, please rise.</i>

40:13.585 --> 40:15.108
Madam foreperson,

40:15.108 --> 40:17.806
in the matter of the people
versus Ephraim Raymer,

40:17.806 --> 40:19.460
has the jury reached a verdict?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.027
We have, Your Honor.

40:21.027 --> 40:23.159
On the sole count of murder
in the second degree,

40:23.159 --> 40:24.596
how do you find?

40:24.596 --> 40:27.947
We find the defendant guilty.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.081
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

40:32.081 --> 40:33.169
thank you for your service.

40:33.169 --> 40:36.085
Court is adjourned.

40:48.533 --> 40:51.187
Nice work, Sam.

40:51.187 --> 40:54.234
We did what we had to do.

40:54.234 --> 40:57.367
Just hope your friend, Rachel,
wasn't looking down.
