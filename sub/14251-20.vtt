00:24.357 --> 00:25.847
What do you think
you're doing, Doc?

00:25.925 --> 00:27.859
An impromptu auditory exam.

00:27.927 --> 00:28.859
Did l pass?

00:28.928 --> 00:29.895
With flying colors,

00:29.963 --> 00:31.726
which leads me to believe
that you did hear me

00:31.798 --> 00:33.629
when l requested
you meet me this morning.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.268
You're right.

00:36.336 --> 00:37.496
l forgot.

00:37.604 --> 00:38.571
l see.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.539
l realize your Sick Bay
training is purely voluntary,

00:42.609 --> 00:44.907
but you haven't spent
any time there

00:44.978 --> 00:46.912
in several weeks, and when l...

00:46.980 --> 00:49.346
try to find you, you're
always in the holodeck.

00:49.416 --> 00:51.714
Correct me if l'm wrong, Doc,
but we haven't been treating

00:51.785 --> 00:54.083
anything more serious
than an ingrown toenail.

00:54.154 --> 00:55.178
That's beside the point.

00:55.255 --> 00:58.122
lf an emergency were to happen,
you must be prepared.

00:58.191 --> 00:59.818
You're too far behind
in your medical texts

00:59.893 --> 01:01.417
to be wasting your time
in the holodeck!

01:02.796 --> 01:04.593
lf it's any consolation,

01:04.664 --> 01:06.393
l have spent most
of the morning immersed

01:06.466 --> 01:08.434
in a complicated
surgical procedure.

01:08.568 --> 01:09.660
Really?

01:09.736 --> 01:12.728
A classic case
of atrophied shocks.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.468
They needed to be extracted
to prevent chrome abrasion.

01:15.542 --> 01:19.842
lt was touch and go for a while,
but the prognosis is excellent.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.972
You'll be ready
for neurosurgery in no time.

01:22.048 --> 01:25.176
Take a look at this, Doc.

01:25.251 --> 01:30.018
This is a fully stock
1969 Chevy Camaro--

01:30.090 --> 01:32.183
one of the earliest
muscle cars ever made.

01:32.258 --> 01:36.820
lmagine: Northern California,
late 20th century.

01:36.896 --> 01:39.057
You're cruising up Highway 1.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.326
The woofers are pounding.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.834
The wind is whipping
through your hair.

01:45.638 --> 01:48.106
Medieval safety constraints...

01:48.174 --> 01:51.701
internal combustion system

01:51.778 --> 01:54.508
producing lethal levels
of carbon monoxide.

01:54.581 --> 01:57.106
Hmm. l stand corrected.

01:57.183 --> 02:00.619
This may be just what you need
to get you back to Sick Bay.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.848
l guess l should have known
this wouldn't interest you.

02:02.922 --> 02:03.854
lt's too much fun.

02:03.923 --> 02:06.187
This isn't about fun, Mr. Paris.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.886
Serving in Sick Bay
is a privilege.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.394
l'd expect you to realize that.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.123
Oh, l do.

02:11.197 --> 02:12.721
l'll be there.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.664
Soon.

02:19.606 --> 02:22.541
Lieutenant Paris, report
to the Bridge immediately.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.603
l'm on my way.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.348
Somebody call for a driver?

02:35.421 --> 02:37.048
Take your station, Tom.

02:37.123 --> 02:39.284
Anything on scans, Harry?

02:39.359 --> 02:42.419
l'm picking up
another spatial distortion

02:42.495 --> 02:43.587
2, 000 kilometers away.

02:43.663 --> 02:44.595
Source?

02:44.664 --> 02:45.756
l have no idea.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.062
lt looks like space
is folding in on itself.

02:48.134 --> 02:50.125
Shields to full.

02:55.708 --> 02:56.675
lt's an alien vessel.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.677
One occupant aboard.

02:58.745 --> 02:59.973
Captain, it looks like

03:00.046 --> 03:03.072
that ship is being powered
by a coaxial warp drive.

03:03.149 --> 03:04.810
Coaxial what?

03:04.884 --> 03:06.408
lt's a hypothetical
propulsion system.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.352
Starfleet engineers have been
dreaming about it for years.

03:09.422 --> 03:12.414
ln theory, it can literally
fold the fabric of space

03:12.525 --> 03:15.824
allowing a ship
to travel instantaneously

03:15.895 --> 03:17.192
across huge distances.

03:21.234 --> 03:23.259
The alien warp drive
is overloading.

03:23.336 --> 03:26.828
ln theory,
a coaxial drive explosion...

03:26.906 --> 03:28.305
could collapse space

03:28.374 --> 03:31.104
within a radius
of a billion kilometers.

03:31.177 --> 03:33.873
ln theory.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.142
Well, let's keep theory
from becoming reality.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.478
Red Alert.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.187
Scan the vessel.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.426
Can we beam the pilot out?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.933
Too much interference.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.697
That ship's about had it,
Captain.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.761
The coaxial core is breaching.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.831
We should vacate this area
of space at once.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.740
We can't just
leave him like this.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.108
Try one more hail.

05:47.146 --> 05:49.671
Nothing.
Maybe he's ignoring us.

05:49.749 --> 05:50.909
Or maybe he's unconscious.

05:50.983 --> 05:52.211
We've got to do something.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.309
Suggestions?

05:57.790 --> 05:59.951
A symmetric warp field.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.721
That should contain
any instabilities

06:01.761 --> 06:03.490
in his space folding core.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.757
How can you be sure?

06:04.831 --> 06:07.698
Advanced subspace geometry.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.200
lt's the one course
at the Academy

06:09.268 --> 06:10.701
where l actually paid attention.

06:10.770 --> 06:13.261
We'll tractor him in
to kill his momentum

06:13.339 --> 06:15.637
and generate a warp field
around his ship.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.142
His flight path is erratic.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.111
We'd be risking collision.

06:20.179 --> 06:22.204
Captain, l can make this work.

06:22.281 --> 06:23.839
Do it.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.984
Passing through
the residual folds in space.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.221
Steady.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.667
Got him!

06:41.734 --> 06:44.703
l've extended our warp field
around his vessel.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.796
His core is powering down.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.363
Nice flying, Tom.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.909
My pleasure.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.172
We're finally receiving a hail.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.407
Open a channel.

06:55.481 --> 06:58.382
Captain Janeway of the
Federation Starship Voyager.

06:58.451 --> 06:59.941
Do you need medical attention?

07:00.019 --> 07:01.213
l'm fine, Captain.

07:01.287 --> 07:03.721
Unfortunately, my ship is not.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.987
lf you need to make repairs,
we might be able to help.

07:07.059 --> 07:08.822
That's very generous.

07:08.895 --> 07:11.557
We'll beam you aboard
in a few minutes. Stand by.

07:11.631 --> 07:12.962
Thank you.

07:13.032 --> 07:14.829
Tuvok.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.740
Energize.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.080
Welcome.

07:28.147 --> 07:29.375
Captain.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.713
l know you put yourselves
in danger to rescue me.

07:31.784 --> 07:32.751
l want to thank you.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.309
l'm glad we could help.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.151
l was so eager
to test my new engine,

07:37.223 --> 07:39.623
l pushed it beyond its limits.

07:39.692 --> 07:43.560
Coaxial warp doesn't seem to be
the smoothest way to travel.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.723
lt's a violent procedure,
but it allows a ship

07:46.799 --> 07:49.233
to travel through space
at incredible speeds.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.599
Considering the dangers,

07:50.670 --> 07:53.138
this method of travel
hardly seems logical.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.037
That's probably true,

07:55.107 --> 07:57.268
but if l were
worrying about danger,

07:57.343 --> 07:58.810
l wouldn't have
become a test pilot.

07:58.878 --> 08:00.072
Where are you from?

08:00.146 --> 08:02.239
The fourth planet
in the Benthan system.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.840
That's about 20
light- years from here.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.976
l'll speak to my engineers
about helping you with repairs.

08:07.053 --> 08:10.318
Without your coaxial drive,
it's a long way home.

08:18.865 --> 08:19.957
Come in.

08:23.469 --> 08:25.403
l'd like to ask you a favor.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.939
l need a change of pace.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.804
l'd like to help Steth
repair his ship.

08:29.876 --> 08:31.810
This isn't a good time to ask.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.404
What do you mean?

08:34.480 --> 08:36.380
l've been reading a report
from the Doctor.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.178
You didn't show up today.

08:38.251 --> 08:41.414
Well, l was a little busy
this morning...

08:41.486 --> 08:43.921
saving someone's life,
as l recall.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.719
ls there something wrong, Tom?

08:45.791 --> 08:47.349
Anything bothering you?

08:47.426 --> 08:49.417
Nothing is wrong.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.019
Since when is not
wanting to spend

08:51.097 --> 08:53.031
time with the Doctor
a capital offense?

08:53.099 --> 08:54.430
You'd have to throw
the whole crew

08:54.500 --> 08:55.626
in the brig for that one.

08:55.701 --> 08:59.797
Maybe. l was just wondering if
there's something on your mind.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.362
You're showing up
for your duty shifts,

09:01.474 --> 09:02.771
you do what's required,

09:02.808 --> 09:04.742
but your heart doesn't seem
to be in it.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.903
You seem preoccupied.

09:06.979 --> 09:11.143
Like l said,
l think l need a change of pace.

09:12.685 --> 09:13.652
You're a different man

09:13.719 --> 09:15.584
from the one that came
on board four years ago.

09:15.655 --> 09:18.351
You've taken charge of your
life, turned yourself around.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.618
l'd hate to see you ruin it.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.591
l won't.

09:25.665 --> 09:29.601
With your permission,
l'll report to Sick Bay.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.301
Permission denied.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.503
Report to Steth's ship instead.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.306
Assist in the repairs.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.471
We need our best man on the job.

09:49.355 --> 09:50.754
And on my way back,

09:50.823 --> 09:52.518
l made the mistake
of flying the prototype

09:52.592 --> 09:54.560
through restricted
Entaban territory.

09:54.627 --> 09:55.559
And?

09:55.628 --> 09:57.152
And, uh...

09:57.229 --> 09:59.424
the Entabans weren't
too pleased to see me.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.666
l limped back to the engineers
on Benthos with phaser holes

10:03.736 --> 10:06.728
through their brand- new
exatanium fuselage.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.273
l think they would
have been happier

10:08.341 --> 10:09.933
to see phaser holes through me.

10:11.677 --> 10:16.478
When l was 16, l followed
an ancient human custom.

10:16.582 --> 10:19.210
l took my father's shuttle
out for a joyride

10:19.285 --> 10:21.776
and proceeded
to fry all the relays.

10:21.854 --> 10:25.085
l'm guessing he wasn't happy
about getting it back.

10:25.157 --> 10:26.647
Actually, he didn't.

10:26.726 --> 10:27.658
As far as l know,

10:27.727 --> 10:29.718
it's still at the bottom
of Lake Tahoe.

10:29.795 --> 10:30.921
Here it is.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.862
The coaxial induction drive.

10:32.932 --> 10:36.060
lt draws in subatomic particles
and reconfigures

10:36.135 --> 10:37.329
their internal geometries.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.633
And this is what makes
folding space possible?

10:39.705 --> 10:41.229
At least in spurts.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.774
Unfortunately,

10:42.842 --> 10:45.970
particle instabilities
keep overloading my engines,

10:46.045 --> 10:47.478
but l'm going to make it work.

10:47.546 --> 10:48.808
l have to keep in motion.

10:48.881 --> 10:52.214
l don't like the thought
of settling down--

10:52.284 --> 10:55.811
too many new ships to drive,
too many intriguing women.

10:55.888 --> 10:57.685
Yeah. l guess so.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.418
When l get this ship back,

10:59.492 --> 11:01.119
l'm going to be
doing the first test

11:01.227 --> 11:03.320
on a new Mithran- class fighter.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.989
l'm told it's more advanced

11:05.064 --> 11:07.032
than any warship
in the Quadrant.

11:07.099 --> 11:08.964
Why don't you come with me?

11:09.035 --> 11:11.435
We'd have a great time.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.435
You can meet up
with Voyager afterwards.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.643
l- l'd love to do that.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.474
lt sounds very exciting...

11:22.048 --> 11:24.881
but l have
responsibilities here,

11:24.950 --> 11:26.850
people who count on me

11:26.919 --> 11:29.353
and B'Elanna would be furious.

11:32.658 --> 11:34.387
B'Elanna.

11:36.495 --> 11:37.962
l have to go.

11:54.246 --> 11:55.907
So, you started without me.

11:55.981 --> 11:58.541
l finished without you.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.209
You're a little late.

12:00.286 --> 12:02.516
Uh, sorry.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.250
l was helping Steth
repair his ship.

12:05.324 --> 12:07.417
How's it going?

12:07.526 --> 12:10.654
Um...pretty slow.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.061
We're both stuck
on how to prevent

12:12.131 --> 12:14.895
the particle overloads
in his propulsion system.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.697
Have you tried
an isokinetic containment field?

12:17.770 --> 12:21.433
Yeah. That's the first thing
we tried.

12:21.540 --> 12:24.008
How long do you think these
repairs are going to take?

12:24.076 --> 12:26.044
l don't know.

12:26.112 --> 12:29.878
l was just hoping
that maybe you could help me

12:29.949 --> 12:31.883
recalibrate
the plasma manifolds tonight.

12:31.951 --> 12:36.251
Uh...l, uh...

12:36.322 --> 12:38.722
l probably should go help Steth.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.026
Tom, is there something wrong?

12:46.665 --> 12:48.132
Why are you interrogating me?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.031
l didn't think l was.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.694
lt sounds more like you
want me to account

12:51.771 --> 12:53.261
for every minute
that l'm not with you.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.863
That's ridiculous.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.100
Can't l have
some time to myself?

12:56.175 --> 12:58.200
Can't l do what l want
without having to report

12:58.277 --> 12:59.471
every detail of it to you?

12:59.545 --> 13:01.604
Tom, you can do
whatever you want.

13:01.714 --> 13:04.205
l just wanted to know
if there was something wrong.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.184
l mean, lately,
you've been canceling dates,

13:06.252 --> 13:08.379
you hide out for hours
in the holodeck...

13:08.454 --> 13:09.751
l am not hiding anything.

13:09.822 --> 13:10.789
That is ridiculous.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.289
ls it?

13:12.358 --> 13:14.155
You haven't even told me
what holodeck program this is

13:14.226 --> 13:15.193
that has you so fascinated.

13:16.762 --> 13:19.424
"The Dancing Girls
of Ninipia Prime."

13:19.498 --> 13:20.897
lt's very entertaining.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.228
Very funny.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.598
You're overreacting.

13:23.669 --> 13:26.433
l am not overreacting.

13:26.572 --> 13:28.802
There is obviously
something going on

13:28.874 --> 13:30.307
and you're refusing to admit it.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.139
Good evening, Lieutenants.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.644
l see you don't have
your dinner yet, Tom.

13:33.712 --> 13:34.644
Can l get you something?

13:34.713 --> 13:35.805
- l'm really not hungry.
- Excuse me.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.644
Are you going to talk to me
about this?

13:37.716 --> 13:39.980
Because if you're not, l don't
want to sit here anymore.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.576
lf you can carry on
an adult conversation

13:41.654 --> 13:42.916
without all the histrionics...

13:42.988 --> 13:44.512
Good night, Tom.

14:14.253 --> 14:17.689
Computer, run
a DNA stability analysis.

14:17.756 --> 14:20.919
How long before my genome
reverts to its previous form?

14:20.993 --> 14:24.929
Time to reversion:
Three hours, 13 minutes.

14:24.997 --> 14:27.591
Complete genome recovery
is imminent.

14:36.909 --> 14:39.571
So l was lying in bed
last night when it hit me.

14:39.645 --> 14:42.273
What you need is a carburetor.

14:42.348 --> 14:43.576
A carburetor?

14:43.649 --> 14:46.641
Yes. lt's a device
that's hundreds of years old.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.311
l can't believe l didn't
think of it yesterday.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.218
Wait. Hundreds of years old?

14:50.289 --> 14:52.257
Surely that couldn't be
of any use to us now.

14:52.324 --> 14:54.292
lt all goes back to basics.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.988
You would be surprised
at how often l find solutions

14:57.062 --> 15:00.725
to 24th century problems
in 20th century technology.

15:02.167 --> 15:06.194
Computer, access Paris program
Alpha 1:"Grease Monkey."

15:07.239 --> 15:08.672
Grease monkey?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.538
Mechanic lingo.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.808
A car's engine can't
run on pure fuel,

15:16.882 --> 15:18.543
so the carburetor supplies it

15:18.617 --> 15:20.517
with a mixture
of vaporized fuel and air.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.746
And you think we need

15:21.820 --> 15:24.914
a device like that
to dilute the particle stream

15:24.990 --> 15:26.617
as it enters the coaxial drive.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.125
Exactly,

15:28.193 --> 15:29.421
and a spare polaric modulator

15:29.495 --> 15:31.725
from Voyager's impulse drive
should do the trick.

15:31.797 --> 15:33.287
Subatomic dilution!

15:33.365 --> 15:35.833
Oh! lt never would have
occurred to me.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.425
l think you've solved it.

15:37.503 --> 15:40.063
Well, we can run a few
simulations on the holodeck

15:40.139 --> 15:41.606
before we actually try it.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.642
Oh...l owe you a lot.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.939
Well, you can thank
my lucky toolbox.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.138
lt's gotten me out of hot water
more than once.

15:48.213 --> 15:49.237
Mmm.

15:51.750 --> 15:55.015
You're lucky to be stationed
on a ship like this.

15:55.087 --> 15:57.783
Replicators to feed
and clothe you

15:57.856 --> 16:00.984
holotechnology
to cater to every whim,

16:01.060 --> 16:03.790
hallways filled with women.

16:03.862 --> 16:04.954
Yeah.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.226
lt's great.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.789
Well, you don't sound convinced.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.301
Aren't you happy here?

16:11.370 --> 16:12.462
Of course l'm happy.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.267
l'm very happy.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.365
l mean...l pilot

16:16.508 --> 16:18.874
one of the most advanced ships
in Starfleet.

16:18.944 --> 16:20.673
l have a beautiful girlfriend.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.043
l'm respected.

16:22.114 --> 16:26.016
l have everything
that l've ever wanted.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.882
You're lucky.

16:27.953 --> 16:31.354
You're part of a family,
part of a structure.

16:31.423 --> 16:33.891
You have rules to guide you.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.325
You don't have to worry
about making a lot of choices.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.953
l usually go to bed at night

16:38.030 --> 16:40.328
not knowing what the next day
has in store...

16:40.399 --> 16:42.731
what trouble l might get into.

16:44.103 --> 16:46.298
You don't have to worry
about those things.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.033
You're very settled.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.037
l remember those days.

16:52.111 --> 16:54.636
l used to be a lot like you--

16:54.713 --> 16:57.876
going anywhere...

16:57.950 --> 16:59.850
doing whatever l wanted...

16:59.918 --> 17:02.512
making my own rules.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.317
Well, then there's hope
for me yet.

17:06.392 --> 17:08.826
Maybe someday
l'll settle down, too,

17:08.894 --> 17:13.797
but...for now...
l prefer to stay on the move.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.169
Sometimes...l wish
that's what l was doing.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.603
Things'll turn around for you.

17:21.673 --> 17:24.642
l've always found
that change is inevitable.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.008
lt comes when you
least expect it.

17:28.247 --> 17:29.771
Yeah, l suppose.

17:29.848 --> 17:30.906
Now, are we ready

17:30.983 --> 17:33.508
to try this carburetor
idea on my ship?

17:33.585 --> 17:35.416
Just give me five more minutes
to finish up here

17:35.521 --> 17:36.613
and l'll be right with you.

17:36.688 --> 17:37.746
Five minutes.

17:37.823 --> 17:40.087
And, Tom...

17:40.159 --> 17:42.218
don't dismiss the suggestion

17:42.294 --> 17:46.287
l made...about coming with me
to fly the new ship.

17:46.365 --> 17:50.199
lt might be fun to escape
the shackles for a while.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.467
Hmm.

18:26.672 --> 18:28.139
Computer, access all files

18:28.207 --> 18:30.107
pertaining
to Lieutenant Tom Paris.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.837
Download into Memory Core Alpha.

18:32.911 --> 18:36.108
Please enter authorization code.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.178
Access granted.

18:39.251 --> 18:41.481
Commencing download.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.399
Hello.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.063
l'm Steth...

19:01.173 --> 19:02.834
a guest of your Captain.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.241
l have been apprised
of your presence on Voyager.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.108
You are not authorized
to access the ship's computers.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.613
You must be Seven of Nine.

19:09.681 --> 19:10.739
That is correct.

19:10.816 --> 19:11.908
Tom mentioned you.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.851
He thinks
you're extremely intelligent.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.251
Lieutenant Paris' opinion of me

19:16.321 --> 19:18.312
is irrelevant
to your being in this room.

19:18.390 --> 19:21.120
Well, uh...Tom felt
we needed some files

19:21.193 --> 19:23.354
for polaric modulators,

19:23.428 --> 19:25.896
but he was called away
before we could access them.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.989
l thought l'd find them
myself and help out.

19:28.066 --> 19:29.363
You were mistaken.

19:29.468 --> 19:31.333
He must be present
to download these files.

19:31.403 --> 19:33.371
Oh, l'm about to meet
him at the holodeck.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.995
We can find the files there.

19:35.073 --> 19:38.338
Voyager's hierarchy is complex.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.776
See that you familiarize
yourself with it.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.313
Good advice.

19:42.381 --> 19:43.973
l'll do that.

19:50.956 --> 19:54.653
Captain's Log, Stardate 517 62. 4.

19:54.726 --> 19:56.421
The repairs
to Steth's coaxial drive

19:56.495 --> 19:59.931
have been completed
well ahead of schedule.

19:59.998 --> 20:02.398
Everything here looks good.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.867
Just give me one more second
to check

20:04.937 --> 20:06.234
the flow- field parameters.

20:06.305 --> 20:07.272
Go ahead.

20:26.858 --> 20:28.587
lt's my box wrench.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.491
l've been looking
all over for this.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.188
l know. l should've asked you,
Tom,

20:32.264 --> 20:35.461
but l needed it
for an experiment.

20:37.436 --> 20:40.200
To, uh...check
your new carburetor?

20:40.272 --> 20:41.432
Not quite.

20:42.874 --> 20:45.138
You're the first humans l've met

20:45.210 --> 20:47.440
and that wrench had
enough cellular residue

20:47.512 --> 20:49.139
on it for me to check your DNA.

20:50.515 --> 20:52.039
l have good news.

20:54.219 --> 20:56.278
We're compatible.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.101
Consider this a favor.

21:10.168 --> 21:14.127
l know how unhappy you've been
with this dreary, settled life,

21:14.206 --> 21:16.606
so l'm taking it off your hands.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.473
l'm betting there's still
some fun to be had here.

21:19.578 --> 21:22.479
Voyager is a great ship, Tom.

21:22.547 --> 21:25.311
l'll take good care of it.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.787
Sorry l'm late.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.558
We were beginning to wonder
if you were ever coming back.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.702
His ship is powering engines.

21:54.212 --> 21:55.839
Something wrong, Tom?

21:58.250 --> 21:59.842
lt's nothing.

22:06.892 --> 22:09.326
l'm just really going
to miss that guy.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.200
Mind if l join you?

22:25.277 --> 22:26.642
Not at all...

22:26.712 --> 22:27.940
Commander.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.241
"Chakotay" will do, Tom.

22:29.314 --> 22:31.373
You don't have to carry
this"rules" thing too far.

22:31.450 --> 22:34.419
l've been discussing
your engineering report

22:34.486 --> 22:35.646
with the Captain.

22:35.721 --> 22:36.983
She was wondering
if we could implement

22:37.055 --> 22:39.285
some of Steth's technology
here on Voyager.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.223
Really?

22:41.293 --> 22:43.591
We thought maybe
you could start on a shuttle.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.459
Do you think you can do it?

22:45.530 --> 22:48.124
l'm sure l can.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.499
Great. You can start right after
you finish with the Doctor.

22:51.570 --> 22:53.629
The Doctor?

22:53.705 --> 22:55.400
He needs your help in Sick Bay.

22:55.474 --> 22:56.736
l told him you'd be there.

22:56.808 --> 22:58.776
Of course.

23:03.548 --> 23:04.515
Lieutenant.

23:04.583 --> 23:05.550
Hi.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.781
l know you've been
avoiding the Doctor,

23:46.858 --> 23:49.725
but don't tell me you've
forgotten where Sick Bay is.

23:49.795 --> 23:52.787
Oh...not yet.

23:52.864 --> 23:54.627
l was just trying to figure out

23:54.699 --> 23:56.599
if there's
a more efficient route

23:56.668 --> 23:58.363
between Sick Bay
and my quarters.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.538
l didn't realize you were
that eager to get there.

24:03.241 --> 24:05.334
So tell me--
are they ready yet?

24:05.410 --> 24:08.345
Uh...not yet.

24:08.413 --> 24:09.778
But they will be soon.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.008
Great.

24:11.082 --> 24:12.879
Hey, let me know
if you have any problems.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.885
Polyduranide
can be tough to replicate.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.420
Oh, it sure can be.

24:16.488 --> 24:19.719
l can't wait to get my hands
around one of those clubs.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.622
Ensign Kaplan won't
know what hit her.

24:21.693 --> 24:24.025
What?

24:24.095 --> 24:25.824
We're going to play golf
with her.

24:25.897 --> 24:28.161
We scheduled a rematch,
remember?

24:28.233 --> 24:29.427
Oh, of course.

24:29.534 --> 24:31.058
l can't wait.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.603
Have you been working
on your putting?

24:32.671 --> 24:34.366
You missed both those
two- footers last time.

24:34.439 --> 24:36.100
l won't let it happen again.

24:36.174 --> 24:38.165
All right.

24:38.243 --> 24:39.267
Give the Doc my best.

24:39.344 --> 24:40.311
l will...

24:42.280 --> 24:44.305
if l ever find him.

24:48.587 --> 24:51.078
You're early, Mr. Paris.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.147
l see some good
came from my report

24:53.225 --> 24:54.487
to Commander Chakotay.

24:54.559 --> 24:57.426
Let's put these extra
few minutes to good use.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.896
Begin with a thorough
bio- bed diagnostic.

24:59.965 --> 25:02.263
l want you to recalibrate
each physiosensor,

25:02.367 --> 25:03.391
making sure to enter

25:03.468 --> 25:05.368
every metabolic
referent precisely.

25:05.470 --> 25:06.368
Okay.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.631
When you're through with that,

25:07.706 --> 25:08.968
run a protein
structure analysis

25:09.040 --> 25:11.531
and then continue your review
of the 37 steps

25:11.610 --> 25:14.170
of a cardiopulmonary
reconstruction procedure.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.975
l'll leave you
to your bio- beds.

25:19.951 --> 25:22.419
Did you forget to disengage
the scan emitters?

25:22.487 --> 25:24.455
Sorry.

25:25.724 --> 25:27.749
Mr. Paris!

25:29.261 --> 25:30.353
l don't know what's wrong.

25:30.428 --> 25:31.360
l realize

25:31.429 --> 25:33.590
it's complicated,
but you must try again.

25:33.665 --> 25:35.997
Actually,
l'm not feeling so well.

25:36.067 --> 25:38.729
How fortunate you're
already in Sick Bay.

25:38.803 --> 25:39.997
l'll run a few scans.

25:40.071 --> 25:42.164
Uh, no, no, Doc.
That's all right.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.265
To be perfectly honest with you,

25:44.342 --> 25:48.972
uh...this is
so frustrating for me.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.641
l usually pick things up
a lot faster than this.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.479
You're here to learn,
Mr. Paris.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.486
lt will get easier with time.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.749
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

25:57.822 --> 25:58.948
Excuse me?

25:59.024 --> 26:01.288
Well, no offense, Doctor, but...

26:01.393 --> 26:03.327
you were programmed
to be a medical genius.

26:03.361 --> 26:05.295
Things always come easy to you.

26:05.363 --> 26:07.661
Me, l'm just a pilot,
a...grease monkey.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.859
And as hard as l might try

26:09.935 --> 26:12.961
to become
a better assistant to you,

26:13.038 --> 26:14.198
it's clear to me now

26:14.272 --> 26:17.139
that l'll never be half
the healer that you are.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.040
Do you mean to tell me

26:20.111 --> 26:23.171
you've been trying
to live up to my standards?

26:24.783 --> 26:26.250
l'm afraid l have.

26:27.485 --> 26:29.112
lt all makes sense now.

26:29.187 --> 26:31.018
The misplaced aggression,

26:31.089 --> 26:33.887
the shirking
of responsibilities...

26:33.959 --> 26:37.827
all classic signs
of an inferiority complex.

26:39.998 --> 26:42.967
l had no idea
my superior abilities

26:43.034 --> 26:45.434
were affecting your psyche
so strongly.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.732
Take the rest of the day off.

26:47.806 --> 26:49.706
Reflect on your strengths.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.765
Realize your worth.

26:54.045 --> 26:56.411
l'll do that, Doctor.

26:57.649 --> 26:59.082
Thank you.

27:19.671 --> 27:20.729
B'Elanna.

27:20.805 --> 27:23.330
What do you think you're doing?

27:23.408 --> 27:25.069
Putting.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.405
ln my quarters?

27:26.511 --> 27:28.979
l can't putt in your quarters?

27:29.047 --> 27:30.275
No.

27:30.348 --> 27:31.645
Since when?

27:33.652 --> 27:35.017
Tom...

27:38.256 --> 27:39.848
what is this?

27:39.924 --> 27:42.085
That is...

27:42.160 --> 27:43.218
a sand wedge.

27:43.294 --> 27:45.558
lt's used for getting
out of traps.

27:45.630 --> 27:47.757
Why is it here?

27:47.832 --> 27:49.424
l replicated it for you.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.560
l thought we could play
a little game of golf

27:51.636 --> 27:53.763
on the holodeck before dinner.

27:53.838 --> 27:58.002
So this is your idea
of an adult conversation?

28:00.145 --> 28:02.978
l don't know what you
are trying to accomplish

28:03.048 --> 28:04.481
with this little stunt,

28:04.549 --> 28:07.450
but let me assure you,
it is not working.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.113
l am sorry if you are bored
because Steth is gone,

28:10.188 --> 28:12.349
but that doesn't mean
that you can just walk in here

28:12.424 --> 28:14.551
and pretend like you haven't
been shutting me out.

28:16.561 --> 28:19.291
You're being a little hard
on Steth.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.959
lf it wasn't for him,
l wouldn't be here right now.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.298
Really?

28:25.370 --> 28:31.036
l mentioned to him that we were
having some problems

28:31.109 --> 28:34.078
and he urged me to...

28:34.145 --> 28:36.238
come and talk to you,

28:36.314 --> 28:38.805
to try to work things out,

28:38.883 --> 28:41.613
to admit l was wrong.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.748
l made a mistake, B'Elanna,

28:46.825 --> 28:48.918
and l'm sorry.

28:53.598 --> 28:56.795
l won't shut you out anymore.

28:56.868 --> 29:01.430
ln fact, l went to the Doctor
and begged

29:01.506 --> 29:03.974
to be excused from my duties.

29:04.042 --> 29:07.603
l realize it's only
a few extra hours,

29:07.679 --> 29:10.147
but they're hours
l want to spend with you.

29:20.925 --> 29:25.828
Steth...turned out to be
a positive influence on you.

29:57.362 --> 29:58.920
Computer, where...

30:02.233 --> 30:04.394
Com- Computer, where are we?

30:04.469 --> 30:10.339
Navigation matrix 17 1 1,
the Kotaba Expanse.

30:10.408 --> 30:11.966
Coaxial leap complete.

30:12.043 --> 30:13.772
How far are we from Voyager?

30:17.315 --> 30:20.978
Computer, lock in Voyager's
last known coordinates

30:21.052 --> 30:23.612
and activate
differential induction drive.

30:23.688 --> 30:25.986
Unable to execute command.

30:26.057 --> 30:27.490
Why not?

30:27.592 --> 30:30.584
The differential induction drive
has been secured.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.755
A security access code
is required

30:32.831 --> 30:34.594
to implement the coaxial leap.

30:39.137 --> 30:41.298
This is Commander Avik
of the Benthan Guard.

30:41.372 --> 30:42.839
We're taking you into custody.

30:42.907 --> 30:45.171
Prepare to surrender the vessel
to us at once.

30:45.243 --> 30:46.710
Benthan?

30:46.778 --> 30:50.737
l need a second to explain,
Commander.

30:50.815 --> 30:52.180
l'm not who you think...

30:52.250 --> 30:54.912
We do not negotiate
with thieves.

30:55.887 --> 30:58.355
No...you don't understand!

30:58.423 --> 31:01.017
l- l need this ship
to get back to Voyager.

31:01.125 --> 31:04.686
Surrender the vessel peacefully
or we will use force.

31:22.947 --> 31:25.381
Why is everybody trying
to shoot me today?

31:25.450 --> 31:26.644
You know what l'm here for.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.743
l don't know
what you're talking about.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.082
Who are you?

31:30.154 --> 31:31.587
l'm Steth.

31:31.656 --> 31:32.816
What?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.085
Look at me.

31:34.158 --> 31:36.217
You did wear this body
for nearly a year

31:36.294 --> 31:38.990
before you switched it
with mine.

31:39.063 --> 31:41.122
That's my body you're in now.

31:41.199 --> 31:42.791
l want it back.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.926
Bear with me
for...for a second.

31:45.003 --> 31:48.336
We have more in common
than you might think.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.310
This better be good, Tom.

31:58.383 --> 32:01.511
l left Vorik right in the middle
of an EPS recalibration.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.415
You can thank me later.

32:04.489 --> 32:07.788
So what's my big surprise?

32:07.859 --> 32:13.764
What would you say
to 24 glorious hours

32:13.831 --> 32:17.130
on the famed fourth planet
of the Kendren System?

32:17.201 --> 32:20.136
You mean the planet where Neelix
is gathering food samples?

32:20.204 --> 32:23.640
Mm- hmm. l ran a few scans and
found the most incredible beach

32:23.708 --> 32:25.403
on one
of the smaller continents.

32:25.476 --> 32:28.639
l replicated
a picnic lunch for us.

32:28.713 --> 32:31.477
Voyager isn't leaving orbit
until tomorrow.

32:31.549 --> 32:34.143
We'd have an entire day.

32:36.354 --> 32:37.912
Only a day?

32:39.324 --> 32:42.487
Oh, l think that we would need
at least a week.

32:42.560 --> 32:46.326
Oh, l wish we could,
but we've only got a day.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.025
You're serious, aren't you?

32:50.101 --> 32:51.193
Completely.

32:51.269 --> 32:52.964
Do you know how much trouble
we would be in?

32:53.037 --> 32:56.473
What could Janeway do,
execute us?

32:56.541 --> 32:58.133
Tom, l am swamped.

32:58.209 --> 33:00.177
l can't get away for an hour,
let alone 24.

33:00.278 --> 33:01.245
B'Elanna...

33:01.279 --> 33:02.746
l have responsibilities here.

33:02.814 --> 33:03.974
We both do.

33:04.048 --> 33:06.141
Responsibilities?
l don't care!

33:06.217 --> 33:07.775
Tom, you're hurting me.

33:07.852 --> 33:09.979
You're a real disappointment
to me.

33:10.054 --> 33:11.214
Do you know that?

33:11.289 --> 33:13.951
l don't know
what l ever saw in you.

33:32.243 --> 33:33.710
Seven.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.109
What brings you here
at this hour?

33:38.182 --> 33:41.242
We were supposed to meet in
the shuttle bay at 2100 hours.

33:41.319 --> 33:42.445
Did you forget?

33:42.520 --> 33:44.283
l did.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.152
l got so caught up
with my reading,

33:46.224 --> 33:47.885
l guess it slipped my mind.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.483
Sorry.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.028
The capillaries in your eyes
are swollen, Lieutenant,

33:52.096 --> 33:55.588
and l see signs of vascular
congestion in your cheeks.

33:55.666 --> 33:57.361
Are you intoxicated?

33:57.435 --> 33:59.767
No, not at all.

33:59.837 --> 34:02.829
l was just exploring
the replicator--

34:02.940 --> 34:04.669
trying some alien beverages.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.041
Only a few were alcoholic.

34:07.111 --> 34:10.012
You are not officially off duty
for another 78 minutes.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.311
l'm on break.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.351
Would you like to join me?

34:14.418 --> 34:16.614
l could replicate another
Trakian ale for you.

34:16.687 --> 34:18.382
That will not be necessary.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.150
Oh, relax, Seven.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.920
You're not on the Borg cube
anymore.

34:22.994 --> 34:24.859
We could finish our work
on the shuttle tomorrow.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.556
That would be
an inefficient use of our time.

34:27.632 --> 34:30.123
l will complete the work myself.

34:31.168 --> 34:32.693
Fine.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.438
Before l leave,
l would like to know

34:36.507 --> 34:38.940
why you were reading
the Captain's personal logs.

34:41.045 --> 34:42.534
l wasn't.

34:42.612 --> 34:43.909
l saw the padd.

34:43.981 --> 34:46.176
lt was unmistakably
the Captain's logs.

34:47.217 --> 34:49.447
You're wrong.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.487
You're...confused.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.420
You couldn't possibly
have seen anything.

34:53.491 --> 34:55.425
You know
l possess an eidetic memory.

34:55.493 --> 34:58.155
l require only seconds
to commit what l see to memory.

34:58.229 --> 35:00.720
Would you like me to quote
the passage you were reading?

35:00.832 --> 35:03.357
l'm warning you--
stay out of my way!

35:03.401 --> 35:05.926
Don't interfere in things
that don't concern you.

35:06.003 --> 35:07.664
lf you bother me again,

35:07.738 --> 35:10.866
l will make things
very unpleasant for you.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.604
Remove your hand from my arm.

35:13.678 --> 35:14.702
Don't be foolish.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.246
You'll regret it.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.464
Enter.

35:41.072 --> 35:43.040
You wanted to see me, Captain.

35:45.042 --> 35:46.373
Yes.

35:48.746 --> 35:50.646
l received
a rather disturbing report

35:50.715 --> 35:53.878
from Seven of Nine regarding
your conduct last night.

35:53.951 --> 35:56.818
She claims
you were drinking on duty.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.813
She's mistaken, Captain.

36:00.925 --> 36:02.017
Don't lie to me, Tom.

36:02.059 --> 36:03.526
l checked the computers.

36:03.594 --> 36:06.620
You replicated
five alcoholic beverages

36:06.697 --> 36:08.221
in the Mess Hall.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.964
She also said
you threatened her.

36:13.070 --> 36:14.901
l'm sorry, Captain.

36:14.972 --> 36:16.132
B'Elanna and l had an argument.

36:16.207 --> 36:17.674
l was upset.

36:17.742 --> 36:20.506
And is that why you were reading
my personal logs?

36:20.578 --> 36:22.205
l wasn't.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.510
Seven recited a passage
l'd written word for word.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.818
She probably accessed
those files herself.

36:28.886 --> 36:31.320
Captain, you can't take
the word of a Borg over mine.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.222
This has to stop, Tom.

36:35.293 --> 36:37.318
Your conduct lately
has been bizarre

36:37.395 --> 36:39.056
and l've heard
far too many complaints

36:39.130 --> 36:40.757
from far too many people
to dismiss it--

36:40.831 --> 36:42.924
Chakotay, the Doctor,
Seven of Nine.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.560
They're all worried
about you, and so am l.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.199
You're right, Captain.
l need some rest.

36:49.273 --> 36:50.433
l'll go right to my quarters.

36:50.508 --> 36:52.601
Tom...

36:52.677 --> 36:55.237
as your Captain
and as your friend...

36:55.313 --> 36:57.304
l want you to report to Sick Bay
for some tests.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.780
We have to find out

36:58.849 --> 37:01.283
if there's something physical
that's causing this behavior.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.785
This is crazy.

37:03.821 --> 37:06.255
l don't need any help.

37:06.324 --> 37:08.155
That's an order.

37:10.127 --> 37:12.994
Security, l need you
in the ready room now!

37:24.242 --> 37:25.834
Are you hurt, Captain?

37:25.910 --> 37:28.344
No. Take him to Sick Bay.

37:28.412 --> 37:30.846
Keep security with him.

37:41.392 --> 37:44.691
The coaxial drive will be
on line in a few minutes.

37:44.762 --> 37:48.425
Good. l've just about overridden
all the lockout commands.

37:48.499 --> 37:50.091
No offense, but l'd like
to get out of your body

37:50.167 --> 37:51.395
as soon as possible.

37:51.469 --> 37:52.868
The alien seems capable

37:52.937 --> 37:55.303
of some sort
of selective DNA exchange.

37:55.373 --> 37:56.601
He absorbs new DNA

37:56.674 --> 37:58.437
while depositing
his current genetic material

37:58.576 --> 37:59.804
into his victims.

37:59.877 --> 38:03.005
Let's hope
he can reverse that process.

38:04.148 --> 38:05.740
That's the last lockout command.

38:05.816 --> 38:08.216
We're set for coaxial warp.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.776
Let's find Voyager.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.722
Captain's Log, supplemental.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.356
The Doctor has treated
Mr. Paris' phaser wounds,

38:21.465 --> 38:24.025
but has been unable
to wake him.

38:24.101 --> 38:26.729
The motive for his attack
remains a mystery.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.034
Neurological scans
yielded very little,

38:29.106 --> 38:30.971
but l did find something
very interesting

38:31.042 --> 38:32.509
in his blood analysis.

38:34.111 --> 38:36.170
There are traces
of a second DNA pattern

38:36.247 --> 38:38.181
in his nucleotide structure.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.012
Possibly the result
of a genetic virus.

38:40.084 --> 38:42.746
Could this be the cause
of his recent behavior?

38:42.820 --> 38:45.118
l don't know,
but l'm running more scans

38:45.189 --> 38:46.520
to see how this
might have affected

38:46.590 --> 38:48.217
his neurological functions.

38:48.292 --> 38:51.125
Captain, a vessel just emerged

38:51.195 --> 38:53.595
from coaxial space
off our starboard bow.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.461
Keep me informed, Doctor.

39:05.509 --> 39:06.737
Hail them.

39:08.112 --> 39:09.704
Captain Janeway.

39:09.780 --> 39:13.614
Welcome back, Mr. Steth.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.174
l know this sounds crazy,
Captain,

39:15.252 --> 39:16.310
but l'm not Steth.

39:16.387 --> 39:18.014
l'm Tom Paris.

39:19.457 --> 39:21.357
l beg your pardon.

39:21.459 --> 39:23.290
We're dealing with an alien
who's some sort

39:23.361 --> 39:24.350
of identity thief.

39:24.428 --> 39:26.191
He traded places with me.

39:26.263 --> 39:29.198
Please beam us aboard.

39:30.801 --> 39:34.259
Maintain your position
while we consider your request.

39:34.338 --> 39:35.828
End transmission.

39:35.906 --> 39:38.204
Hold him in a tractor beam
until you hear from me.

39:38.275 --> 39:39.242
Aye, Captain.

39:39.310 --> 39:41.369
l have a feeling Steth
and his new friend

39:41.512 --> 39:42.843
are behind whatever's
happened to Tom.

39:42.913 --> 39:43.845
Captain?

39:43.914 --> 39:45.677
No time to explain.
l'll be in Sick Bay.

40:00.698 --> 40:02.222
Captain?

40:08.572 --> 40:11.200
Commander, l'm reading
an unauthorized shuttle launch.

40:12.943 --> 40:14.410
lt's the Captain.

40:14.478 --> 40:16.275
She's in the shuttle
Tom's been working on.

40:16.347 --> 40:17.644
Try hailing her.

40:17.715 --> 40:20.013
She's not responding.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.449
Hail Steth's ship.

40:23.354 --> 40:25.584
Look, l don't know who you are,

40:25.656 --> 40:27.590
but l want to know
what's happening here.

40:27.658 --> 40:28.590
Who's on that shuttle?

40:28.659 --> 40:29.751
Captain Janeway.

40:29.827 --> 40:31.454
No. l'm betting the alien

40:31.529 --> 40:35.021
switched my body...
Tom's body for hers.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.862
You've got to let us out
of this tractor beam.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.162
We can catch her with this ship.

40:38.235 --> 40:40.465
Chakotay...

40:40.538 --> 40:41.470
it's me.

40:41.539 --> 40:42.836
How do l know that?

40:45.342 --> 40:47.105
The other day in your office,

40:47.178 --> 40:48.805
you told me
l'd turned my life around.

40:48.879 --> 40:51.643
Well, give me the chance
to prove it.

40:51.715 --> 40:53.148
Let me go after the shuttle.

40:53.217 --> 40:54.445
lt is the only way

40:54.518 --> 40:56.645
we can get everybody
back into the right body.

40:57.688 --> 40:59.417
Harry...

40:59.490 --> 41:01.390
disengage the tractor beam.

41:08.132 --> 41:11.260
20, 000 kilometers and closing.

41:11.335 --> 41:12.700
Has he detected us yet?

41:14.205 --> 41:16.298
l'd say he has.

41:19.410 --> 41:23.210
Gentlemen, l'd advise you
to reconsider this pursuit.

41:23.280 --> 41:26.477
Killing me will only keep you
trapped in those bodies.

41:26.584 --> 41:27.846
He's right.

41:27.918 --> 41:29.078
We can't risk killing him.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.883
Yeah, but nothing's keeping
him from killing us.

41:31.956 --> 41:35.289
Damn! The ship's not nearly
as maneuverable as a shuttle.

41:35.359 --> 41:36.417
Shields are down.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.223
l'm surprised you're so eager

41:38.295 --> 41:40.661
to reclaim your life
on Voyager, Tom.

41:40.731 --> 41:43.393
l was just as disappointed
with it as you were.

41:43.467 --> 41:45.731
Then l guess we were both wrong.

41:45.803 --> 41:48.033
lt's time to move on again.

41:48.105 --> 41:52.201
Oh, Tom...be sure to send
my best regards to B'Elanna.

41:52.276 --> 41:53.402
Hmm?

41:55.412 --> 41:58.108
He's charging the coaxial drive.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.047
Set the sensors to track him.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.742
l can't. He's blocking us.

42:01.785 --> 42:07.121
We won't be able to follow him
once he goes into coaxial warp.

42:10.661 --> 42:11.855
We're losing him!

42:11.929 --> 42:13.897
The carburetor!

42:13.964 --> 42:16.159
We added a polaric modulator

42:16.233 --> 42:17.393
to the coaxial drive.

42:17.468 --> 42:20.130
lf l can target the modulator,

42:20.204 --> 42:21.967
hit it
with a chromoelectric pulse,

42:22.039 --> 42:23.768
that'll disrupt his engines.

42:23.841 --> 42:26.002
Here goes.

42:34.952 --> 42:37.386
l hope you still have
my box wrench.

42:37.454 --> 42:40.184
Faulty carburetors
can be a pain to fix.

42:43.360 --> 42:47.319
Captain's Log, Stardate 5177 5. 2.

42:47.398 --> 42:48.888
While the alien intruder

42:48.966 --> 42:51.628
remains trapped in the body
of his last victim,

42:51.702 --> 42:55.194
the Doctor has found a way
to return Tom, Steth and me

42:55.272 --> 42:56.933
to our own bodies.

42:57.007 --> 42:59.703
Doctor,
l can't thank you enough.

42:59.777 --> 43:01.802
You've given me my life back.

43:01.912 --> 43:03.641
All in a day's work.

43:03.681 --> 43:05.672
There were times when l thought

43:05.749 --> 43:07.580
l would be stuck
in that body forever.

43:07.651 --> 43:08.675
And believe me,

43:08.752 --> 43:11.152
l'm just as happy to be back
to the old Tom Paris.

43:11.221 --> 43:13.018
What do you plan to do now?

43:13.090 --> 43:15.081
l'm going to take
her back to Bentha.

43:15.159 --> 43:18.185
l hope to find the person
who belongs to that body.

43:18.262 --> 43:20.423
But who knows
if that's the end of it?

43:20.531 --> 43:23.398
We have no idea
how long she or he

43:23.467 --> 43:25.128
has been switching identities.

43:25.202 --> 43:27.136
lt may take a while...

43:28.639 --> 43:30.800
but l will do whatever l can

43:30.874 --> 43:33.809
to find everyone
you've violated.

43:33.877 --> 43:36.539
A security team will
escort her to your ship

43:36.614 --> 43:39.515
and erect a force field
to contain her.

43:54.898 --> 43:57.196
So this is where
you've been hiding?

43:57.267 --> 43:58.825
A garage?

43:58.902 --> 44:02.201
lt's more than just a garage.

44:02.306 --> 44:04.501
This is a monument

44:04.541 --> 44:07.032
to hundreds and hundreds
of hours...

44:07.111 --> 44:10.205
that l probably should
have spent with you.

44:10.280 --> 44:12.271
Probably?

44:12.349 --> 44:14.283
Definitely.

44:16.220 --> 44:19.189
lt's a lovely garage, Tom,

44:19.256 --> 44:21.952
but l still don't understand
why you brought me here.

44:22.026 --> 44:26.429
Well, consider it
a symbolic gesture.

44:26.497 --> 44:31.958
lt's my less- than- subtle attempt
to...let you in.

44:32.036 --> 44:33.765
l see.

44:33.837 --> 44:38.365
To make it clear that l mean
almost as much to you as a...

44:38.442 --> 44:40.205
a cam- a- ro.

44:40.277 --> 44:43.075
lt's a mint condition

44:43.147 --> 44:45.081
1969...

44:46.750 --> 44:49.014
ca- mare- oh.

44:49.086 --> 44:52.021
And, yes...you mean
a lot more to me.
