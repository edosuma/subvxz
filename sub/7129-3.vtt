You want me for the old
fat guy's part? Thanks.

00:13.583 --> 00:16.667
We don't want you.
Again, thanks.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.583
We got Matt LeBlanc!

00:18.583 --> 00:20.709
[All cheering]
What?!

00:20.709 --> 00:21.834
And the best part--

00:21.834 --> 00:24.625
Merc's excited about
the show again.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.417
When did he stop being
excited about the show?

00:26.417 --> 00:27.875
Never.

00:27.875 --> 00:29.000
Matt's been telling me

00:29.000 --> 00:30.875
about the changes
for his character.

00:30.875 --> 00:32.250
Changes?

00:32.250 --> 00:33.834
How's not gonna be
a headmaster anymore.

00:33.834 --> 00:34.792
How's that?

00:34.792 --> 00:36.291
I love that
he's a coach.

00:36.291 --> 00:37.709
A coach?

00:37.709 --> 00:39.000
A lacrosse coach.
MERC: Love it!

00:39.000 --> 00:40.750
It was Beverly's idea.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.208
I'm just not sure
about lacrosse.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.625
Is it too lacrossey?

00:43.625 --> 00:44.917
I know what you mean.

00:44.917 --> 00:47.250
How about hockey?
Ooh, hockey works!

00:47.250 --> 00:49.041
We could call it Pucks!

What was the name
of that little hotel

01:53.834 --> 01:55.750
in Cap Ferrat?

01:55.750 --> 01:58.792
With the precarious
balcony and the, um--

01:58.792 --> 02:01.208
the fat guitar player?

02:03.375 --> 02:05.583
Bleh Bleh Bleh.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.333
Yes.

02:08.291 --> 02:10.959
I liked that place.
Mm-hm.

02:10.959 --> 02:13.291
We could be there
in 12 hours.

02:13.291 --> 02:15.417
Sorry.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.208
I'm dreading today.

02:19.208 --> 02:20.667

[French accent]
I let you have, uh...

02:32.250 --> 02:34.208
the sex with me.

02:34.208 --> 02:36.333
Oh. Romantic.

02:38.166 --> 02:40.458

It's not a handle!

02:40.458 --> 02:42.125

02:42.125 --> 02:44.709
[Chuckles]
That's not gonna work.

02:44.709 --> 02:46.166

Yeah, come on.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.792
No, we have to get up.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.834
I believe
you are up.

02:49.834 --> 02:51.834
Ohh. The wit,
the wordplay--

02:51.834 --> 02:54.208
it's like being in bed
with Noel Coward.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.709
I suspect it's nothing
like being in bed

02:56.709 --> 02:59.125
with Noel Coward.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.250
No, sweetheart, seriously--

03:01.250 --> 03:03.333
we can't do this.
We don't have time for this.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.458
We have to go--We--

03:05.458 --> 03:08.000
We can't be late.

annoying.

get started.

interested in you.

say yes because--

No.
Say what?

have to see that.

I think you're gonna have
to buy a lot of sun block.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.041

gonna be living here

Don't they?

Hey.

Oh, do you know
what a balaclava is?

07:35.709 --> 07:37.083
No.

How about an anorak?

07:38.250 --> 07:39.500
Now you're just
making sounds.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.875
Can I talk to you
guys about something?

07:41.875 --> 07:42.917
Course.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.333
Morning's character--
the librarian--

07:44.333 --> 07:45.458
Right?

07:45.458 --> 07:47.166
Does she have to be
a lesbian?
Yes.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.166
Or does she?
Yes, she does.

07:49.166 --> 07:50.417
Are you sure?
Yes.

07:50.417 --> 07:51.458
What if she isn't?
It would not be as good.

07:51.458 --> 07:52.750
Or would it?
It would not.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.125
Are you sure?
Yes.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.542
Right, let's assume you two
could do this all day.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.625
Huge fun. But I'm
gonna jump in.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.625
Matt, what's your problem
with Nicola being a lesbian?

08:00.625 --> 08:02.333
It just seems like...

08:02.333 --> 08:04.083
if my guy's
in love with her,

08:04.083 --> 08:06.542
but he can't ever
get her, it's...

08:06.542 --> 08:08.250
Funny?
It is.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.959
Very funny.
Not saying that.

08:10.959 --> 08:13.000
It's just--

08:13.000 --> 08:15.166
I don't know. The whole
lesbian thing--

08:15.166 --> 08:16.917
it's kind of a dead end.

08:16.917 --> 08:19.542
I don't know that lesbians
would agree with you.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.500
So, um, what
are you suggesting?

08:21.500 --> 08:24.208
OK, let's just say,
for a second,

08:24.208 --> 08:26.083
she's not a lesbian.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.542
[Stifled yell]
Wow.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.166
Go on.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.667
Say she's straight.

08:32.667 --> 08:34.375
You can still have
all the conflict.

08:34.375 --> 08:36.208
We still fight
all the time

08:36.208 --> 08:37.792
She still
totally hates me.

08:37.792 --> 08:39.041
Sure.

08:39.041 --> 08:41.000
You know, she thinks
I'm arrogant,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.166
she thinks I'm a pig.

08:42.166 --> 08:43.583
Oh, I'm with you there.

08:43.583 --> 08:45.875
But underneath all that,

08:45.875 --> 08:47.542
she's attracted to him,

08:47.542 --> 08:49.500
and she hates it.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.291
And I know it.

08:51.291 --> 08:53.625
And she hates
that I know it.

08:53.625 --> 08:54.875
Huh?

08:56.500 --> 08:58.500
Well, uh--heh!

08:58.500 --> 09:01.375
Clearly, you're
a master of subtext.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.041
But, um, what I think is
actually going on here--

09:04.041 --> 09:05.834
I think you--
and, when I say "you",

09:05.834 --> 09:07.709
I'm referring, of course,
to "your guy"--

09:07.709 --> 09:10.625
can't stand the idea
there's a woman who isn't
attracted to you.

09:10.625 --> 09:11.709
Oh, really?
Yes.

09:11.709 --> 09:12.875
Oh, really?
Yes.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.542
Oh, really?
And we're back to that.

09:14.542 --> 09:16.000
Well, Matt, look--

09:16.000 --> 09:17.500
let us think about this.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.709
Why?

09:19.709 --> 09:20.875
Darling.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.208
All right.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.709
I'll think about it.
Hmm. No.

09:23.709 --> 09:25.875
Well, that was
collaborative.

09:25.875 --> 09:28.709
What?! I am not going
to coddle his homophobia

09:28.709 --> 09:30.875
and pretend to entertain
some notion we both know--

09:30.875 --> 09:33.333
[Cell phone ringing]
Is that ever switched off?

09:34.625 --> 09:35.625
[Beep]

09:35.625 --> 09:37.041
We're not done
with this.

09:37.041 --> 09:39.250
Yo.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.250
Unbelievable.
I know.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.250
Not him--you!
Jesus Christ,
what are you doing?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.417
We talked about this.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.083
I can't help it.
He starts speaking,

09:47.083 --> 09:48.500
and I just--I just--

09:48.500 --> 09:49.917
I don't care.

09:49.917 --> 09:51.583
The last time
you pissed him off,
we found ourselves

09:51.583 --> 09:53.417
running a show about
a hockey coach.

09:53.417 --> 09:54.542
I don't know what
new level of hell

09:54.542 --> 09:56.750
you're hoping
to relegate us to.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.917
Fine. How about this?
From here on in, he's yours.

09:58.917 --> 10:00.709
What?

10:00.709 --> 10:02.250
MATT: So?

10:02.250 --> 10:04.208
Matt.
Oh, I'm so sorry,

10:04.208 --> 10:06.583
but I was supposed to be
in wardrobe 20 minutes ago.

10:06.583 --> 10:07.834
I'm afraid I must run.

10:07.834 --> 10:09.208
Aww!

10:09.208 --> 10:11.083
Oh, I'm sure you and Sean

10:11.083 --> 10:13.250
can sort out any
concerns you may have.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.959
I'll see you both later.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.083
She's fun.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.917
She's just...

10:20.917 --> 10:23.125
very passionate
about the work.

10:23.125 --> 10:24.875
Ah. Lucky you.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.083
Listen, that was
this chef I gotta
go check out

10:27.083 --> 10:28.417
for my new
restaurant.

10:28.417 --> 10:29.667
If I don't do it today,
we could lose him.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.333
You want to come?
We can talk on the way.

10:31.333 --> 10:34.166
Uh...all right.

10:38.542 --> 10:40.250
So, about this
lesbian thing--

10:40.250 --> 10:42.250
I hear what you're
saying--I really do.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.208
But I think what's
important to remember
about the character is--

10:44.208 --> 10:46.458
Fuck me!

10:46.458 --> 10:48.750
Tell me that's
not yours.

10:48.750 --> 10:51.291
You like?
Ohh!

10:51.291 --> 10:53.792
I read there was only
three in the whole world.

10:53.792 --> 10:56.667
Yep. Me,
the Sultan of Brunei,

10:56.667 --> 10:58.333
and some drug guy.

10:58.333 --> 11:00.625
Oh, it's magnificent.

11:00.625 --> 11:01.667
Here.

11:03.917 --> 11:05.458
And that's why
I was never picked.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.375
Really?
Go for it.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.792
Ohh.

11:08.792 --> 11:11.291
I am so happy.

11:11.291 --> 11:12.959
Ohh!

11:14.125 --> 11:15.542
Ohh!

11:16.959 --> 11:18.250
Ohh!

11:18.250 --> 11:20.542
Get a room.
Can I?

11:20.542 --> 11:23.000
Oh, I wish I knew
how to drive.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.291
[Engine roars, tires screech]

11:27.417 --> 11:28.792
Look at me!

11:28.792 --> 11:31.250
How cool do I look
driving this?!

11:31.250 --> 11:32.333
Seriously?

11:32.333 --> 11:34.041
Even I don't look cool

11:34.041 --> 11:35.625
with you driving this.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.125
[Laughs]

11:37.125 --> 11:38.792
Right.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.375
So, should we get
back to your issue

11:42.375 --> 11:43.667
with Morning's
character?

11:43.667 --> 11:46.625
Sure. I totally
understand what you and--

11:46.625 --> 11:48.333
I keep wanting
to call her Betsy.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.458
Ohh, no,
don't do that.

11:50.458 --> 11:51.917
Her mother's name
is Betsy.

11:51.917 --> 11:53.208
She hates it.

11:53.208 --> 11:54.500
[Laughs]

11:54.500 --> 11:56.291
Well, now I gotta
call her Betsy.

11:56.291 --> 11:58.417
Oh, brilliant.

11:58.417 --> 11:59.834
Turn right here.

12:01.709 --> 12:03.375
Where is this chef?

12:03.375 --> 12:05.083
Las Vegas.

12:14.041 --> 12:15.333
Ah.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.875
What do you think?

12:18.291 --> 12:20.542
For?
Morning.

12:20.542 --> 12:21.792
In the first
library scene.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.667
Um...

12:23.667 --> 12:25.208
it's very, uh...

12:25.208 --> 12:26.333
Fabulous?

12:26.333 --> 12:27.417
Ha!

12:27.417 --> 12:29.709
I was gonna say Dr. Seuss.

12:29.709 --> 12:32.250
I think it's fun.
No, it's definitely fun.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.542
But she's, um--
she's a librarian,

12:34.542 --> 12:36.750
not someone who might have
relatives in Whoville.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.250
No, no. You remember
we talked about

12:41.250 --> 12:44.125
her being a strong,
confident woman?

12:44.125 --> 12:45.583
Well, who else
would wear this?

12:45.583 --> 12:47.750
Hmm. I don't know.

12:47.750 --> 12:51.125
Uh, maybe a cat?
Perhaps in a hat.

12:51.125 --> 12:53.083
[Laughs]
OK, OK.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.792
But we want her to look
young, though, right?

12:54.792 --> 12:56.250
I mean, she's playing
late twenties.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.792
Absolutely.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.959
How old do you think
she is actually?

13:02.959 --> 13:05.959
Morning? Hmm.
No one knows.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.917
But I've got a friend
who did a pilot

13:09.917 --> 13:12.166
with her
and William Shatner
back in the '80s.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.542
The '80s?

13:14.542 --> 13:16.667
Well, what did she play--
his granddaughter?

13:16.667 --> 13:18.625
How about his wife?

13:18.625 --> 13:21.125
Mmm, I know.
It's crazy, right?

13:21.125 --> 13:22.792
That girl--

13:22.792 --> 13:24.792
somewhere she's got
a painting of herself,

13:24.792 --> 13:27.417
and it's looking like
all kinds of shit.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.458
Mmm! Mmm!

13:35.458 --> 13:37.625
This guy's
fuckin' amazing.

13:37.625 --> 13:39.125
Did you try
the prawns?

13:39.125 --> 13:40.458
Genius.
And the catfish

13:40.458 --> 13:41.917
is like the food version
of your car.

13:41.917 --> 13:43.875
Mmm.

13:43.875 --> 13:46.667
Dude, you are
blowing me away here.

13:46.667 --> 13:48.375
[Speaks Thai]
My pleasure.

13:48.375 --> 13:50.792
You speak Thai?

13:50.792 --> 13:52.417
No, just
the basic stuff--

13:52.417 --> 13:55.125
Please, thank you,
how much for the girl?

13:55.125 --> 13:57.208
[Cell phone rings]

13:57.208 --> 13:58.709
Hello?

13:58.709 --> 14:00.500
Where are you?

14:00.500 --> 14:02.250
I'm with Matt.
Still?

14:02.250 --> 14:04.500
Is that Betsy?
Hi, Bets!

14:04.500 --> 14:06.458
What's that?
Matt says hi.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.417
Listen, take the car home.
I may be a while.

14:08.417 --> 14:09.750
What's going on?

14:09.750 --> 14:11.250
Um...heh heh.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.875
We're in Las Vegas.

14:12.875 --> 14:14.208
Vegas, Betsy!

14:14.208 --> 14:16.208
Las Vegas?

14:16.208 --> 14:18.250
Yeah, Matt had to
check out this chef
for his restaurant,

14:18.250 --> 14:20.917
and then we have to
go to the opening
of some new club.

14:20.917 --> 14:22.083
Give me the phone.

14:22.083 --> 14:23.500
I'll be home tonight.
He's got a plane.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.083
I'll call you later.
I love you. Bye.

14:25.083 --> 14:25.959
Stop it!

14:32.792 --> 14:35.417
Remind me--
who's doing that shitty
talking-dog pilot?

14:35.417 --> 14:36.917
We are.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.959
Well, it might be funny.

14:38.959 --> 14:41.667
Wait. Bad news.

14:45.166 --> 14:47.875
We lost John Stamos.
Fuck!

14:47.875 --> 14:49.542
I just got off the
phone with the agent.

14:49.542 --> 14:51.917
He's definitely taking
that thing at ABC.

14:51.917 --> 14:54.208
That fucking cocksucker.

14:54.208 --> 14:56.709
He's your son's
godfather.

14:56.709 --> 14:59.041
I'm not saying
he's a bad guy.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.542
What the--Not now!

15:00.542 --> 15:02.959
Aw, boo-oo-oo!

15:02.959 --> 15:05.542
So, now we're back
to square one.

15:05.542 --> 15:07.333
And this would be
for...

15:07.333 --> 15:09.208
Easy Marks--
the con man thing.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.709
[Scoffs] I know.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.208
Stamos would've
been perfect.

15:12.208 --> 15:13.583
I'll get you
a new list.

15:13.583 --> 15:15.333
Hey, what about
Matt LeBlanc?

15:15.333 --> 15:16.792
What about Pucks?

15:16.792 --> 15:18.500
You think?

15:18.500 --> 15:20.000
I still like it.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.583
We'll see.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.333
Nipple, nipple,
nipple--

15:23.333 --> 15:24.875
No.

15:24.875 --> 15:26.583
Nipple, nipple?

15:28.792 --> 15:30.208
[Sighs]

15:35.834 --> 15:38.917
[Dance music playing]

15:41.834 --> 15:43.208
My father's
a neurologist,

15:43.208 --> 15:44.792
my mother's
an orthopedic surgeon.

15:44.792 --> 15:47.041
Both my brothers
are surgeons.

15:47.041 --> 15:48.542
It's amazing
I'm sitting here
talking to you

15:48.542 --> 15:49.834
and not removing
someone's spleen.

15:49.834 --> 15:52.750
[Laughs] Did you ever
want to be a doctor?

15:52.750 --> 15:54.959
Yeah, I went to
university for it.

15:54.959 --> 15:56.625
Somewhere along
the line, though,
I realized

15:56.625 --> 15:59.583
I find the interior
of the human body
disgusting.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.500
Yeah, people are gross.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.208
What about you?

16:04.208 --> 16:07.208
What would you be doing
if you hadn't done this?

16:07.208 --> 16:09.041
Uh...

16:09.041 --> 16:11.583
I would've either been
a Formula One driver...

16:11.583 --> 16:12.792
Of course.

16:12.792 --> 16:14.333
...or a porn star.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.792
Impressive. Not just
a porn actor--

16:16.792 --> 16:18.792
a porn star.

16:18.792 --> 16:20.917
Yeah, well, I kind of
have whayou need

16:20.917 --> 16:22.583
to make it
in that business.

16:24.291 --> 16:25.458
What?

16:25.458 --> 16:28.000
You're speaking...

16:28.000 --> 16:29.583
anatomically?

16:29.583 --> 16:32.250
Yeah. It's ridiculous.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.667
It's like a third arm.
Seriously?

16:34.667 --> 16:36.417
Yeah. Well,
without the hand.

16:36.417 --> 16:38.166
I assumed.

16:38.166 --> 16:39.125
Uh...

16:40.875 --> 16:42.917
congratulations?

16:42.917 --> 16:44.083
Hey, I had nothing
to do with it.

16:44.083 --> 16:46.750
I was born this way.
When they saw my sonogram,

16:46.750 --> 16:48.166
they thought I was twins.

16:48.166 --> 16:51.125
[Both laugh]

16:51.125 --> 16:52.834
Hey, are you
winding me up?
I'm very naive.

16:52.834 --> 16:55.500
I'm telling you--
it's got everything
but an elbow.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.667
I gotta take a leak.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.917
You want to see it?

17:01.917 --> 17:03.417
Ha!

17:03.417 --> 17:04.542
Uh, no. I--

17:04.542 --> 17:06.500
Ha! I don't think so.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.875
You sure?

17:07.875 --> 17:10.583
Uh, yeah, I'm sure.
But thank you.

17:10.583 --> 17:12.291
Whatever.
I'll be right back.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.792
I still don't get it!

17:36.792 --> 17:38.250
How can you not get it?

17:38.250 --> 17:39.792
Are you sure you're
telling it right?

17:39.792 --> 17:42.000
Fuck you. I've told it,
like, a million times.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.542
Maybe you left
something out.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.458
What? The bear goes in,
he eats the guy,

17:46.458 --> 17:48.709
then he eats the girl,
then he comes out,
and he says--

17:48.709 --> 17:50.542
Up-up-up-up!
Turn right here.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.667
This may take a while.
This guy never lets us--

17:53.667 --> 17:55.208
Hey, how's it going?

18:06.667 --> 18:07.917
All right, man.

18:07.917 --> 18:10.125
Thanks for schlepping
around with me today.

18:10.125 --> 18:11.750
Hey, it was a pleasure
being schlepped.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.834
Listen, uh,
before I go in,

18:13.834 --> 18:15.375
I promised Beverly--
You mean Betsy.

18:15.375 --> 18:18.417
Stop it. I promised her
we'd discuss that
lesbian business.

18:18.417 --> 18:21.125
Ooh, I love
lesbian business.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.834
Finished?
Yeah.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.625
Right. You've seen
the original show.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.083
There's something wonderful
about your character

18:27.083 --> 18:28.917
loving this woman
he can never have.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.583
He refuses to believe
that one day

18:30.583 --> 18:32.083
she won't come around.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.792
I mean, yeah, it makes him
look a little foolish,

18:33.792 --> 18:35.417
but it's funny and sweet.

18:35.417 --> 18:37.583
I agree.
You do?

18:37.583 --> 18:39.083
Absolutely.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.125
It's one of the best
things in the show.

18:41.125 --> 18:44.250
It humanizes the guy.
You totally feel for him.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.333
Then why change it?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.458
How many years did you
do the show in the U.K.?

18:48.458 --> 18:49.875
Four series.

18:49.875 --> 18:51.083
That's how many
episodes?

18:51.083 --> 18:52.667
24.
Right.

18:52.667 --> 18:55.166
That's one season
for us.

18:55.166 --> 18:59.000
Friends  did
236 episodes.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.750
You've got to give
yourself places

19:00.750 --> 19:02.625
for stories to go.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.917
How long do you think
Ross and Rachel
would have lasted

19:04.917 --> 19:06.625
if Rachel had been
a lesbian?

19:06.625 --> 19:08.875
Or Sam and Diane
on Cheers?

19:08.875 --> 19:11.750
Or Frasier and--

19:11.750 --> 19:14.291
I don't know who.
I never watched
that show.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.834
Look, you're the writer,
but I'm telling you--

19:16.834 --> 19:19.458
audiences need
something to root for.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.625
And when we're
in season 3,

19:21.625 --> 19:24.458
and you're
up at midnight,
looking for stories,

19:24.458 --> 19:26.458
you're gonna be
banging your head
against the wall,

19:26.458 --> 19:28.417
saying,
"How many times

19:28.417 --> 19:30.959
can this guy
hit on the dyke?"

19:36.000 --> 19:38.166
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Front door ajar.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.667
Oh, my God.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.125
I know.

19:44.125 --> 19:46.166
How are you?
Exhausted.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.625
I can imagine.
Las Vegas?

19:48.625 --> 19:50.000
Yeah.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.667
And all day with him.
What was that like?

19:52.667 --> 19:56.083
Uh...it was fine.

19:56.083 --> 19:57.709
Fine?

19:57.709 --> 20:00.000
Yeah, I don't know.
I guess it was fun.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.583
Fine and fun?

20:02.583 --> 20:04.959
Fine and fun.

20:04.959 --> 20:06.917
You like him.
I do.

20:06.917 --> 20:08.208
You twat.
I'm sorry.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.667
I know that's not
what you want to hear,

20:09.667 --> 20:11.583
but he's fantastic.

20:11.583 --> 20:14.458
He's crazy and generous
and very funny.

20:14.458 --> 20:16.417
We laughed all day.

20:16.417 --> 20:18.166
You're smitten.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.500
Hardly. All right,
a little smitten.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.875
Just a smit.

20:21.875 --> 20:23.333
He let me drive his car.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.458
Yeah. I know that doesn't
mean anything to you,

20:25.458 --> 20:28.709
but...ohh, my God!

20:28.709 --> 20:30.667
And Vegas--
Vegas is mad.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.542
Going into this club,
there are all these paparazzi,

20:32.542 --> 20:35.208
outing at Matt,
shouting at me.
Why you?

20:35.208 --> 20:36.917
Because I was with him.

20:36.917 --> 20:39.083
And then we got inside,
and I met Lindsay Lohan.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.333
And some people
from The Hills--

20:41.333 --> 20:43.041
which I have no idea
what that is,

20:43.041 --> 20:44.792
but everyone
was very excited.

20:44.792 --> 20:46.208
And--And that girl

20:46.208 --> 20:47.750
from that film
that we walked out on.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.583
Sounds like
a glamorous crowd.
It really was.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.083
Sarcasm missed.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.250
Anyway, we hung out
there for a while,

20:52.250 --> 20:54.083
then he showed me his cock,
and we flew home.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.291
I'm sorry, what?

20:55.291 --> 20:56.750
He showed me his cock.

20:56.750 --> 20:59.583
He showed you his cock?
Right.

20:59.583 --> 21:01.291
Why?

21:01.291 --> 21:03.917
Because it's enormous.

21:03.917 --> 21:05.583
Like a sea creature.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.917
Like something
out of Jules Verne.

21:07.917 --> 21:10.041
Oh, my God.

21:10.041 --> 21:11.917
You can't imagine.
I don't want to.

21:11.917 --> 21:14.000
So, help me here.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.750
Did you ask to see it?

21:15.750 --> 21:17.500
No. No,
that would be weird.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.291
Ah, yes.
He offered.

21:19.291 --> 21:21.834
And this is
happening where?
At the club.

21:21.834 --> 21:24.250
He just hauled it out
in the middle of a club?

21:24.250 --> 21:26.250
No. No, I followed him
into the loo.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.625
This is a very
unsettling story.

21:28.625 --> 21:29.917
That's pretty much
all there is to it.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.583
I would hope so.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.750
Oh, you have to see
all this free stuff I got.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.959
Before the club,
we met this designer

21:37.959 --> 21:39.291
who just gave us
all these clothes.

21:39.291 --> 21:40.750
Why?
So Matt would
wear them.

21:40.750 --> 21:41.959
Again, why you?

21:41.959 --> 21:43.959
Because I was with him!

21:43.959 --> 21:46.458
Now, apparently,
these are very hip.

21:46.458 --> 21:47.625
It says "Blood Rat".

21:47.625 --> 21:48.959
That's the name
of the label.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.500
You're not
gonna wear that.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.792
I might.

21:52.834 --> 21:57.166
It says "Blood...Rat".

21:57.166 --> 22:00.000
It's cashmere.
It's very soft.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.125
Also, these trousers.

22:03.125 --> 22:06.000
The stains are
intentional. I asked.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.542
Some shirts.

22:07.542 --> 22:09.083
This cap.

22:09.083 --> 22:12.458
And look at these
glasses.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.542
What do you think?

22:16.542 --> 22:19.083
I think you look
like a bloody idiot.

22:19.083 --> 22:21.375
I understand
why they're giving
their clothes away.

22:21.375 --> 22:23.333
They're
desperately trendy,
rodent-themed,

22:23.333 --> 22:25.250
and, by the way,
would it have killed you

22:25.250 --> 22:26.625
to bring something
back for me?

22:26.625 --> 22:28.458
Oh.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.792
These might look--
Don't.

22:37.709 --> 22:39.750
I don't suppose
you even talked about
the lesbian thing.

22:39.750 --> 22:41.000
We did.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.750
And?

22:42.750 --> 22:44.333
We're on
the same page.

22:44.333 --> 22:47.250
Oh, well,
that's something.

22:47.250 --> 22:49.333
He's right.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.667
I'm just saying,
if you take
the long view,

22:59.667 --> 23:02.291
it makes more sense
for the characters,
you know?

23:02.291 --> 23:04.417
I mean...

23:04.417 --> 23:06.250
if this show goes
four or five years--

23:06.250 --> 23:07.875
If this show goes
four or five years,

23:07.875 --> 23:09.500
hopefully I'll be long dead,

23:09.500 --> 23:11.917
and you and your new partner
can sort it out.

23:11.917 --> 23:13.792
You know,
I think I look

23:13.792 --> 23:16.125
like a bit of
an arsehole in this.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.375
Mm-hm.

23:20.750 --> 23:24.083
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be
a thoughtless prick.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.875
I just get
carried away.

23:25.875 --> 23:27.083
Yes, you do.

23:28.709 --> 23:30.959
You know, you might look
quite sexy in this.

23:30.959 --> 23:32.208
In Blood Rat?

23:32.208 --> 23:33.834
Maybe under
a tasteful blazer.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.500
It is soft...

23:37.500 --> 23:39.750
if you can ignore
the bleeding rodent.

23:39.750 --> 23:42.208
You're welcome to these
stained trousers,
if you like.

23:43.959 --> 23:45.417
I think not.

23:47.625 --> 23:50.542
He really let you
see his willy?
Ohh.

23:50.542 --> 23:53.166
When I close my eyes,
I'm still seeing it.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.417
It's that big?

23:54.417 --> 23:55.709
It could attack a city.

23:55.709 --> 23:58.083
[Laughs]

23:58.083 --> 24:00.041
Did you show him yours?
No!

24:00.041 --> 24:01.834
The situation
was humbling enough
as it was.

24:01.834 --> 24:05.000
I don't think you've got
anything to be ashamed of.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.917
There's something to be said
for human proportions.

24:06.917 --> 24:08.667
Ow! Human proportions?

24:08.667 --> 24:10.291
Oh, no.

24:12.875 --> 24:15.542
[Telephone rings]
[Sighs]

24:16.875 --> 24:18.709
[Ring]

24:18.709 --> 24:20.625
Hello?
Hey!

24:20.625 --> 24:21.834
Is Sean there?

24:21.834 --> 24:24.166
Hello, Matt.

24:24.166 --> 24:27.125
Hey, Betsy!
Is he around?

24:27.125 --> 24:28.959
It's your boyfriend.

24:28.959 --> 24:30.667
Hello.
Hey.

24:30.667 --> 24:32.458
You were right.
I fucked up the punch line.

24:32.458 --> 24:33.667
The bear goes in...

24:35.792 --> 24:37.625
Well, that makes
more sense.

24:37.625 --> 24:40.000
[Laughing]

24:43.125 --> 24:44.917
[Locker banging]

24:44.917 --> 24:47.792
BOY: Aww,
he's so scared.

24:47.792 --> 24:49.583
2nd BOY:
Guys, let me out!

24:50.959 --> 24:52.792
Did you lock Dawson
in there again?

24:52.792 --> 24:55.083
No.
DAWSON: Yes, they did!

24:55.083 --> 24:58.625
Come on, you guys.
We talked about this.

24:58.625 --> 25:00.291
You're a team.

25:00.291 --> 25:01.458
You've got to support
each other...

25:01.458 --> 25:03.625
treat each other
with respect.

25:03.625 --> 25:05.750
So long as you keep
pulling crap like this,

25:05.750 --> 25:07.250
you're never gonna win.

25:07.250 --> 25:10.208
He said the puck has
more brains than you do.

25:10.208 --> 25:12.417
Well, let's give him
another five.

25:12.417 --> 25:14.417
Cut!

25:14.417 --> 25:16.083
[Bell rings]
Ha! That's great.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.458
Great. Moving on!

25:17.458 --> 25:18.834
Was that too big?

25:18.834 --> 25:20.709
No, I thought
it was fun.
Cool.

25:22.834 --> 25:25.917
You notice how he only
looks at you now?

25:25.917 --> 25:28.041
Maybe he thinks
you don't like him.

25:28.041 --> 25:29.458
I don't.
Well...

25:29.458 --> 25:31.041
That's not it. I don't
like a lot of people

25:31.041 --> 25:32.166
and they all look at me.

25:32.166 --> 25:34.291
You did say
he was mine.

25:34.291 --> 25:36.291
I don't care.
It's rude.

25:36.291 --> 25:37.834
And what's
all this business

25:37.834 --> 25:39.417
about him
calling me Betsy?

25:39.417 --> 25:41.000
Ohh, I told him
not to do that.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.041
No, I--I said it was
your mother's name
and you'd hate it.

25:44.041 --> 25:45.792
What?

25:45.792 --> 25:48.709
That's just like giving
him a gift, isn't it?

26:07.709 --> 26:09.959
You smoke?

26:09.959 --> 26:11.667
That's OK.
My agent knows.

26:14.917 --> 26:16.667
Can I bum one?

26:16.667 --> 26:18.542
Sure.

26:31.959 --> 26:34.208
Oh, Beverly.
I found Beverly.
She's right here.

26:34.208 --> 26:35.542
Beverly,
you seen Sean?

26:35.542 --> 26:37.542
Yeah, he should be
in there somewhere. Why?

26:37.542 --> 26:40.375
Matt needs him. He wants
to change some lines
in the hockey scene.

26:40.375 --> 26:42.875
Did he just ask
for Sean, not--

26:42.875 --> 26:44.083
not the two of us?

26:44.083 --> 26:46.875
Uh...yeah.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.291
Where is Matt?
In his dressing room.

26:53.125 --> 26:55.625
Beverly's coming
to talk to Matt.

27:01.208 --> 27:03.000
MATT: Who is it?

27:03.000 --> 27:06.083
It's...Betsy!

27:06.083 --> 27:07.417
Come on in.

27:09.458 --> 27:11.000
What's up?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.291
We need to speak.
OK.

27:13.291 --> 27:14.917
Have a seat.

27:19.709 --> 27:22.000
Clearly, you have
a problem with me.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.458
Now, I don't know whether

27:23.458 --> 27:25.458
it's that you're
uncomfortable around
strong women,

27:25.458 --> 27:27.583
or you're threatened
by me in particular.

27:27.583 --> 27:29.583
Or maybe you just
don't like me.

27:29.583 --> 27:32.333
Well, that's fine.
We don't have to like
each other.

27:32.333 --> 27:35.583
However, we do
have to remain...

27:35.583 --> 27:38.458
um...prof-
professionals.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.375
And, um...

27:40.375 --> 27:42.458
that means--
that means

27:42.458 --> 27:43.792
treating each other
with, um--

27:43.792 --> 27:45.208
with mutual respect.

27:45.208 --> 27:47.250
My husband and I

27:47.250 --> 27:48.917
created this show together,

27:48.917 --> 27:50.333
so I--I--I--

27:50.333 --> 27:53.000
I--I would appreciate you

27:53.000 --> 27:56.041
according me every
courtesy you give him.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.875
If--If you--

28:01.125 --> 28:02.667
What?
If you...

28:02.667 --> 28:05.041
have thoughts
on a scene, you, um--

28:05.041 --> 28:07.375
you--you--you--
you talk to me
as well as him.

28:07.375 --> 28:09.667
If you want
to change a line,

28:09.667 --> 28:12.041
you come to both of us,
not--not just him.

28:12.041 --> 28:15.208
I--I believe I have
earned that--

28:15.208 --> 28:16.709
ahem--right.

28:16.709 --> 28:18.291
You're right.

28:18.291 --> 28:20.500
It was unprofessional.
I apologize.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.500
Well, um...thank you.

28:23.500 --> 28:26.333
I can promise you it
will never happen again.

28:26.333 --> 28:27.959
I would appreciate that.

28:27.959 --> 28:30.291
Uh, can I say
one thing...

28:30.291 --> 28:33.166
in the interest
of mutual respect?

28:33.166 --> 28:35.041
Certainly.

28:35.041 --> 28:37.417
My eyes are up here.

28:37.417 --> 28:39.166
I'm not a piece of meat.

28:48.917 --> 28:50.917
There you go.
