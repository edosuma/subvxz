Last delivery's here.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.039
Watch yourself!

03:11.240 --> 03:12.309
X marks the spot.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.028
Christophe here.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.475
<i>- What up?
- Delivery confirmed.</i>

03:23.640 --> 03:25.631
<i>- We're in position.
- Good luck.</i>

03:25.800 --> 03:26.789
<i>We got one shot.</i>

03:26.960 --> 03:30.509
<i>If anybody fucked up and those stones
aren't there, it ain't my problem.</i>

03:30.680 --> 03:33.877
<i>- They're there.
- Not for long. Later.</i>

04:07.480 --> 04:08.833
I got you.

04:11.000 --> 04:11.989
Thank you.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.032
- I'm here for the reception.
- Name?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.474
Angie Rawlins.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.990
You can go on up.
Front elevator to the mezzanine.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.672
Thanks.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.232
Where are the stones?

05:58.520 --> 05:59.873
Who the fuck are you?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.153
Who's getting them for you?

06:12.120 --> 06:13.155
Fuck off!

06:17.440 --> 06:19.158
I want a name and a number.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.874
Okay.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.792
- Okay, I'll tell you.
- I know.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.158
I hate these things.
Don't you hate these things?

06:28.120 --> 06:29.678
Just doing my job.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.078
Then again, you never know
who you're gonna meet, right?

06:37.320 --> 06:41.029
I bet you're a lot more fun
than any of those boring people upstairs.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.950
Really, ma'am, I have a job to do.

06:47.920 --> 06:51.879
Right, well, I suppose I should
go see what they're selling.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.958
Tommy.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.676
Change of plans, he's gay. You're up.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.671
- No way.
- Yes, way.

07:02.840 --> 07:03.829
<i>Come on, man!</i>

07:04.000 --> 07:06.594
- All right, Tommy, your turn.
- Hell, no!

07:06.760 --> 07:10.070
This is not a conversation.
Do it! And make it good.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.639
Shit.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.075
Keycard.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.437
So why don't you hold onto my purse.
I shouldn't be too long.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.878
<i>Aloha.</i>

07:28.240 --> 07:29.229
Hi.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.634
I hope you don't take
offense to this...

07:33.960 --> 07:36.520
..but I have such a weakness
for a man in uniform.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.113
- Lf that's your thing.
- Uniforms are my thing.

07:40.760 --> 07:45.470
I mean, every time I see a sailor,
all I can think about is seafood.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.029
I'm actually not supposed to
be talking on duty.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.428
Who's talking?

07:49.920 --> 07:51.478
Baby, this is flirting.

07:53.960 --> 07:58.397
Unless you're one of those big handsome
men letting it all go to waste on a woman.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.516
The world is full of fools.

08:02.840 --> 08:03.829
Yahtzee!

08:06.240 --> 08:09.152
- What's it looking like?
- About a six-second rotation.

08:13.480 --> 08:14.595
Tommy.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.758
But you can call me Rachel.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.433
Douglas.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.596
I just hope I'm not too...

08:27.760 --> 08:28.749
..pretty for you.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.555
- I'm hooked up.
- That bitch.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.273
I like sunsets, puppy dogs...

08:41.720 --> 08:42.994
I'm big in the pants.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.038
I can almost tie it in a knot.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.353
Let's get the table.

08:53.560 --> 08:57.997
One day I'll have to come in here and do
a little shoplifting and let you catch me.

08:58.160 --> 09:02.199
Resist arrest just so you can
wrestle me down...

09:03.280 --> 09:04.269
..and cuff me.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.991
I can be pretty rough.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.198
Don't get me excited now.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.349
Faith.

10:06.680 --> 10:07.669
Faith.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.029
Faith.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.079
Holy shit!

10:19.240 --> 10:20.593
Earthquake.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.916
But I bet you can hit a 10
on the Richter scale anytime, Douglas.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.159
Let's do it.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.152
All right. Y'all know what to do.
Let's get it on.

11:14.200 --> 11:18.557
<i>- 911, what's your emergency?
- I want to report a robbery in progress.</i>

11:18.720 --> 11:20.836
Robbery in progress. What's the location?

11:42.640 --> 11:45.757
Man, I love colored stones.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.876
This one blue diamond
is at least $2.5 million.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.996
Oh, yeah? So whose stuff we stealing?

11:52.160 --> 11:54.674
- Drug dealers, money launderers...
- Works for me.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.114
This...

11:58.840 --> 12:00.034
This I can use.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.874
T.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.837
Check this out.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.316
This is what we came for.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.950
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.156
Jackpot. The rest is ours.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.069
Yeah.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.596
Your employer betrayed you.
The police are on the way.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.876
<i>- Leave the stones.
- Who is this?</i>

12:27.680 --> 12:29.750
You know the ones I mean.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.876
I'm not gonna be able to do that.

12:33.560 --> 12:34.549
Wrap them up.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.673
Let's go, boys.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.313
Better go move my car.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.993
Five-O at the door, gotta go.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.074
<i>- Move now!
- Time to bounce. Leave this shit.</i>

13:01.360 --> 13:03.237
- Is this your car?
- Yeah, it's my car!

13:03.400 --> 13:05.277
- Get it out of here!
- Move your shit...

13:05.440 --> 13:07.635
- I'll move that, you move this.
- All right.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.111
Let's go. Out of here, right now.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.754
They stopped the trains.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.480
We don't have a lot of time.
Daria comes with me.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.791
I can't tell you how to get there,
but you know where to be.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.951
- Faith.
- Faith.

14:05.640 --> 14:06.675
It's clear.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.472
Hold it.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.559
All clear.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.069
Okay.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.713
Nice.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.675
<i>- Train is secure.
- Get this train out of here.</i>

15:10.840 --> 15:11.909
You got it.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.799
The stones?

15:42.520 --> 15:44.033
Watch out!

15:45.560 --> 15:46.993
The bag!

17:09.440 --> 17:10.429
Fuck.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.352
Enjoying California?

17:53.520 --> 17:56.557
Hope we're not here long.
I hate sunshine.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.912
We may have a problem.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.309
The stones?

18:03.800 --> 18:05.711
The Exchange was just robbed.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.595
Let's hope that was part of the plan.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.754
Who's in charge?

18:41.440 --> 18:42.509
Who wants to know?

18:49.720 --> 18:51.153
Follow me.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.918
Vanessa. What are you still doing up?

19:01.080 --> 19:04.152
- Just a little longer?
- Just a little longer?

19:04.320 --> 19:06.356
Sweetheart, you have school tomorrow.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.590
Come on. Time for bed.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.235
- Getting heavy!
- No, I'm not.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.433
Wait a minute.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.909
There's something behind your ear.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.472
Please. That is so lame.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.790
- What you mean?
- It's in your hand.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.192
This hand? Or this hand?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.592
Watch.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.474
- How'd you do that?
- Magic.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.712
- Is it for me?
- Of course it's for you.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.238
A diamond for my princess.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.669
It's beautiful.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.274
- So are you.
- I love you, Daddy.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.998
I love you too.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.309
Let's say our prayers.

20:04.240 --> 20:08.028
Angels east, angels west,
north and south, just do your best...

20:08.200 --> 20:10.509
..to guard her and watch her
while she rests.

20:10.680 --> 20:11.908
- Amen.
- Amen.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.399
Give me some love.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.833
Can I have another one?

20:21.080 --> 20:23.071
Yeah, you can have another one.

20:25.680 --> 20:26.999
Vanessa's in the bed now.

20:27.160 --> 20:30.675
- She'll be asleep for the rest of the
night. - She won't listen to me.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.274
I'll talk to her. Go to sleep anytime.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.193
- I'm watching TV if you need me.
- All right. Thank you.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.317
Player, what the hell happened?

20:55.800 --> 20:57.791
Should we be considering
a long vacation...

20:57.960 --> 21:00.235
..in a warm foreign climate
with no extradition?

21:00.400 --> 21:04.029
The cat that called was only interested
in the black stones.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.272
- Christophe sold us out.
- Or something.

21:09.240 --> 21:12.596
- Oh, God, you made it.
- By the skin of my black ass.

21:12.760 --> 21:17.436
Man, some Chinese dude kicked my ass
all around that goddamn train track.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.955
Asshole busted my earpiece too.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.353
- And the worst part, he snagged the loot.
- Shit!

21:24.800 --> 21:27.360
Maybe it's time to rethink
this no-gun policy shit.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.238
A little ass-whupping ain't shit.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.597
At least you didn't have to play
all foxy with the rent-a-cop!

21:34.440 --> 21:37.238
- This all we got.
- So, what do we do now?

21:40.840 --> 21:43.149
- Wait to hear from me.
- So where are you going?

21:43.800 --> 21:45.711
I'm gonna get some answers.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.399
- Hold up, dog. I got your back.
- I got this one.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.156
But if I need you, I'll call you.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.596
- All right.
- All right?

21:58.160 --> 21:59.878
Be careful.

22:10.840 --> 22:13.877
So this is Mr. Christophe.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.629
Apparently we're not
his first visitors today.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.439
<i>Please, Se√±or Ling, have mercy.</i>

22:19.600 --> 22:22.672
Whatever you're going to say,
make it the truth.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.355
You may not have another opportunity.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.230
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.953
Bang!

22:36.120 --> 22:37.439
You like it?

22:38.680 --> 22:40.113
It's all right.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.757
You want it? I'll make you
a deal on it, ammo included.

22:45.920 --> 22:51.040
It's got reactive armor, Browning
50-caliber, 7.62 M-60 machine gun.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.031
And that cannon there, that's 90 mm.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.556
Good around the bad areas of town.
Keeps neighborhood kids in line.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.073
- I'll pass.
- How about this?

22:58.240 --> 23:01.437
- A Marine Corps Assault Hovercraft?
- I'm here on other business.

23:01.600 --> 23:04.068
Hey, Arch! We're out of room
in the storage.

23:04.240 --> 23:07.630
All right, put them in my office
and be careful, they're expensive.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.239
Well, not expensive to me.

23:09.400 --> 23:12.915
Hey, listen, you weren't by any chance
downtown today, were you, Tony?

23:13.080 --> 23:14.513
Not at all.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.392
I didn't think so.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.717
- Ever see a black diamond?
- I've seen a white diamond, pink...

23:21.880 --> 23:25.156
..yellow, blue ones. I've seen Neil
Diamond. Awesome in concert.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.719
He's in town in two weeks...

23:33.240 --> 23:34.992
Never seen a black diamond.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.679
Not like this.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.271
- Wow. You got me.
- Find out what they're worth.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.635
- Is there a timetable on this?
- Yesterday.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.836
- That's what I figured.
- I'll be back.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.798
Gonna return a favor to a friend.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.669
Looks dead to me.

24:37.480 --> 24:41.109
- Guess you got to him first.
- Not me, not my style.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.396
You're the one that called me.

24:44.720 --> 24:47.188
The same one that bumped into Miles.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.398
Who the fuck are you?

24:50.560 --> 24:53.393
- My name is Su.
- All right, Su, I'm Sally.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.120
- I want the black stones.
- Make me an offer.

24:58.040 --> 25:01.749
- You can walk out of here alive.
- No deal.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.919
<i>Leave a message.</i>

25:13.080 --> 25:16.117
<i>Mr. Fait, I know you're there.
Pick up the phone.</i>

25:18.360 --> 25:20.351
<i>We need to talk, now.</i>

25:22.280 --> 25:23.633
Who the fuck is this?

25:23.800 --> 25:26.997
The man for whom Christophe arranged
to have the black stones...

25:27.160 --> 25:30.516
..brought into the country
and deposited at the Jewelry Exchange.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.159
The man who wants them back.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.870
- Now.
- All right, well, how much?

25:35.640 --> 25:38.996
Maybe you didn't understand me.
The stones are already mine.

25:39.160 --> 25:40.149
Yo, check this out?

25:40.320 --> 25:43.153
I got them, I'm selling them,
put the money on the wood!

25:43.680 --> 25:45.159
I don't have time for this.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.197
That's your last offer?

25:47.520 --> 25:49.556
I can be a very dangerous man, Mr. Fait.

25:51.400 --> 25:54.039
I don't get it. Do I look like
the Salvation Army?

25:54.200 --> 25:57.954
I bust my ass all night and got nothing
to show for it. You know what, dog?

25:58.120 --> 26:00.395
It don't even matter who the fuck you are.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.516
I ain't got nothing for you.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.274
Shit!

27:05.040 --> 27:06.519
Shit!

27:55.120 --> 27:56.269
Give us the stones.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.036
How many times I got to tell you people?

27:59.200 --> 28:02.670
I'm a businessman.
Make me a fucking offer!

28:03.960 --> 28:05.712
Here's your offer.

28:06.160 --> 28:09.516
That shit ain't gonna work, homes,
because I don't have the stones!

28:09.680 --> 28:10.908
Tell us where they are.

28:23.920 --> 28:24.909
Come on!

29:49.080 --> 29:50.069
The car!

30:02.360 --> 30:04.316
What is it with these fucking stones?

30:07.840 --> 30:09.637
- Yeah.
- It's Archie.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.075
Bad news. We got a problem.

30:12.400 --> 30:16.075
I put word out on the street
to get some info on the stones.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.959
Next thing I know,
the Wu-Tang Clan shows up here.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.678
Three important elements here.

30:20.840 --> 30:21.989
One, I'm outmanned...

30:22.160 --> 30:25.550
..two, they're heavily armed,
and three, they're about to pound me.

30:25.720 --> 30:29.235
- I can't watch anymore. I got a
few licks... - Let's see the rest.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.789
Did you see my new DVD players?

30:31.960 --> 30:32.949
<i>All right! Okay!</i>

30:33.400 --> 30:35.550
<i>- Give me that!
- I forgot I had them. Sorry!</i>

30:35.720 --> 30:40.191
I could've resisted more. But they could've
beat me into a coma or killed me.

30:40.360 --> 30:44.114
How could I tell you where the stones
are if I'm dead or on life support?

30:44.280 --> 30:46.874
So I threw in the towel,
reluctantly, for your sake.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.713
Okay, so you saved yourself
to tell me something.

30:49.880 --> 30:51.632
- So tell me.
- What?

30:51.800 --> 30:54.030
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.430
- What did they say?
- Well, they said:

30:56.600 --> 30:59.558
"Give me the stones,
you fat cracker motherfucker. "

30:59.720 --> 31:01.551
- That sort of thing.
- That's it?

31:01.720 --> 31:04.951
That's pretty bad.
Cracker is kind of racist.

31:05.120 --> 31:08.396
Thanks for keeping yourself alive
long enough to tell me nothing!

31:08.560 --> 31:11.199
- Did you call the police?
- Did I call the police?

31:11.360 --> 31:13.271
Look around here, are you crazy?

31:13.440 --> 31:16.273
Only question now is,
who's behind this jack move?

31:16.440 --> 31:20.991
I don't know, but they got great guns
I can't even get. U.S. Special Forces only.

31:21.680 --> 31:24.069
- Chambers.
- Jump Chambers?

31:24.240 --> 31:25.639
I hope not.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.434
Hey, who's Jump Chambers?

31:30.600 --> 31:33.160
This guy's in on everything
that goes down in town.

31:33.320 --> 31:37.029
The only one I know that can get those
weapons. And he has a fucking army.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.634
You're on your own,
I don't need the headache.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.519
And since I'm totally fucked, who are you?

31:43.400 --> 31:44.753
Yeah, you got an ID?

31:44.920 --> 31:47.354
Buddy? Picture, preferably?

31:48.480 --> 31:49.549
Yeah, all right.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.190
- This means nothing to me.
- Let me see it.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.910
It's Taiwan, Central Security Bureau.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.310
- Taiwanese Intelligence.
- Read Chinese?

32:01.480 --> 32:03.391
No, but I know "cop"
in every language.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.755
What are you?
Some kind of kung fu James Bond?

32:05.920 --> 32:08.992
- The stones belong to Taiwan.
- They belong to Chambers now.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.470
- I'm starting to hate this fucking phone.
- I'll get you a new one.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.438
- Yeah.
- I hope you've reconsidered.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.875
Oh, it's bad-ass! What's up, homes?

32:19.640 --> 32:22.677
You've made this difficult, Mr. Fait.
Let me make it easy.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.559
I can't wait to hear this.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.593
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

32:31.720 --> 32:34.996
She's very pretty in her pink pajamas,
aren't you, Vanessa?

32:35.160 --> 32:37.799
<i>- Son of a...
- I want my stones, Mr. Fait.</i>

32:38.280 --> 32:40.191
Let me talk to the Chinese gentleman.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.237
Don't you fucking touch her!

32:42.400 --> 32:44.675
The Chinese gentleman, please.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.713
He has my daughter.
He wants to talk to you.

32:55.160 --> 32:56.149
Jesus, Tony.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.311
What happened? What did you just do?

33:19.480 --> 33:22.836
I said I have the stones,
and I won't negotiate for your daughter.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.115
- What?
- That's stupid.

33:24.280 --> 33:27.033
It will confuse him,
buy us time, keep her alive.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.556
What the hell are you talking about?
This motherfucker has my baby!

33:30.720 --> 33:32.995
Look, I know him.

33:33.560 --> 33:37.394
I want the stones, you want your
daughter. We can help each other.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.558
So I'm stuck with you.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.269
Get in.

34:09.159 --> 34:10.991
We gotta see Chambers.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.638
Find a place to put her.

34:38.639 --> 34:41.393
My daddy's gonna come
and kick your butts!

34:46.159 --> 34:48.196
Su says he has the stones.

34:49.239 --> 34:53.074
But why cut me off?
Why not negotiate for the girl?

34:53.920 --> 34:55.592
Doesn't make any sense.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.915
Buyers fly in tomorrow.
Should we stop them?

34:59.280 --> 35:01.430
We'll never regain their confidence.

35:01.880 --> 35:05.555
We need information. Find
the right people, pay whatever it costs.

35:07.120 --> 35:11.113
Something's not right.
Something's happening with the stones.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.312
What about the girl?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.753
We'll need her. She stays alive...

35:16.920 --> 35:18.399
..for now.

35:20.640 --> 35:24.155
Yeah, I'm on my way to see Chambers
now. No, I don't have a choice.

35:24.320 --> 35:27.471
Get in touch with his people,
let him know I need to see him.

35:27.760 --> 35:28.749
I'll call you back.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.872
I'm sorry about your daughter.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.836
- How old is she?
- Mind your business.

35:46.280 --> 35:49.158
She's 8. She'll be 9 in September.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.951
Mine is 15.

35:52.480 --> 35:55.472
- Boyfriends?
- Never. I'd kill them.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.392
You wish.

36:00.880 --> 36:03.792
- About time you PMD.
- PMD?

36:03.960 --> 36:05.757
Yeah, put me down.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.797
What's this all about?

36:08.720 --> 36:12.508
- The stones are not what you think.
- No shit.

36:13.560 --> 36:17.872
- What about this guy who has Vanessa?
- He's exactly what you think he is.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.869
A thief and a killer.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.799
Great.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.108
Fucking great.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.553
I want my daddy!

36:34.000 --> 36:34.989
Keys.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.317
Where'd you get this piece of shit?

36:39.480 --> 36:43.951
Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa have
a long walk back from the campground.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.918
- You sure you cleaned it out?
- It's clean, all right.

36:50.520 --> 36:52.670
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

36:53.520 --> 36:54.999
Go to sleep!

37:13.720 --> 37:17.269
<i>Angels east, angels west...</i>

37:17.440 --> 37:20.113
..north and south, just do your best...

37:20.600 --> 37:23.319
..to guard her and watch her
while she rests.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.558
Amen.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.956
Who rang that bell?

37:56.040 --> 38:00.750
Here are your visitors, Mr. Chambers.
And the morning mail.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.039
Hey, yo, Vogel.

38:07.960 --> 38:09.757
My DVD's broke.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.229
Get you a new one straight away,
Mr. Chambers.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.550
Well, well, well. Tony Fait.

38:14.720 --> 38:18.872
Come all this way to visit his
old pal Jump. Who's the gook?

38:19.480 --> 38:21.232
Chinese guy.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.074
Hey.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.870
No shoes in my crib, man.

38:43.400 --> 38:48.235
- How you doing, Jump?
- Don't waste my fucking time, nigga.

38:48.520 --> 38:51.830
- Look, I got a problem.
- How's Daria?

38:52.440 --> 38:55.352
- Good.
- Yeah, she always was good.

38:55.520 --> 39:00.275
From the moment I saw her to the
moment you took her away from me.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.950
- Problem?
- The black stones.

39:04.120 --> 39:06.350
That bitch brought in too.

39:06.520 --> 39:10.399
I made a lot of money with her, but
that's all stopped now. You stopped that.

39:10.560 --> 39:13.313
You decided it was okay
to put an end to that.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.635
- Black stones, what?
- I need them back.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.190
The only smart thing you did
was not pimping her yourself.

39:20.360 --> 39:24.273
See, because then I'd have been real
heated and you'd have been real dead.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.158
But you don't pimp, right?

39:26.320 --> 39:30.757
You're just a thief in the night,
stealing shit that don't belong to you.

39:32.080 --> 39:33.308
Hey.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.430
- What? He don't talk?
- I don't speak Korean.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.472
Yeah, well, I do.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.275
Bought me a little Korean
spot downtown.

39:50.440 --> 39:53.159
Bringing in the soul brothers
24-7, 365.

39:53.320 --> 39:57.074
Black man gouging Koreans.
Ain't that a switch, Chick?

39:58.200 --> 40:03.513
Them motherfuckers got faces like walls,
but love to drink and look at naked girls.

40:03.680 --> 40:06.433
Place ain't no shitbox.
You should see my office.

40:06.600 --> 40:10.195
Got that shit decked out
like a kabuki love palace.

40:10.360 --> 40:12.590
You know what that is, right?

40:13.160 --> 40:16.436
Why don't you roll by sometime?
Check out the poon.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.594
My little girl is mixed up in this.

40:21.560 --> 40:24.358
If I don't get those stones back,
she's dead.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.473
What do you want, man? I mean...

40:34.520 --> 40:38.195
- I'm begging.
- You know, I was thinking.

40:39.160 --> 40:43.312
That was a big heist. Risky heist.

40:43.960 --> 40:49.910
What would make a man go through that
kind of trouble, take that kind of heat?

40:53.000 --> 40:54.991
Gotta be something good.

40:57.240 --> 40:59.310
Something valuable.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.153
Jump...

41:05.200 --> 41:07.475
..it's my little girl.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.878
Make another one.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.110
You mother...

41:12.440 --> 41:14.032
Drama.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.996
I see the slope's no dope.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.276
Got a lot of offspring running
around, brother.

41:22.440 --> 41:24.431
Big score is once in a lifetime.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.989
- Yo, let me at him.
- Go ahead. Shit.

41:36.640 --> 41:38.039
Say hey to Daria for me.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.594
Don't forget your fucking shoes.

41:46.960 --> 41:47.949
Pussy.

41:51.480 --> 41:56.156
I used to really look up to that guy.
Used to want to be just like him.

41:56.320 --> 42:01.235
- In Taiwan, I can make him talk.
- Yeah, well, this ain't Taiwan.

42:01.440 --> 42:05.399
Only thing we can do now is try to find
out where the stones are and get them.

42:05.560 --> 42:08.632
- You make it sound easy.
- It won't be.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.754
- What?
- They're at his club.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.991
How do you know?

42:21.160 --> 42:24.869
I know. I can just feel it.
It's never happened to you?

42:25.040 --> 42:26.519
No.

42:26.680 --> 42:32.789
- Thought you Chinese were all mystical.
- We like to gamble. Not guess.

42:33.400 --> 42:39.157
It's no guess, but I could be wrong.
I'll hit the club, you go see Archie.

42:40.040 --> 42:41.519
Why?

42:42.240 --> 42:45.869
- He has to remember something.
- What if he can't?

42:46.040 --> 42:48.918
Pretend it's Taiwan.
Make him remember.

42:56.600 --> 42:59.797
Hey. Get away from here.
What are you doing?

42:59.960 --> 43:02.599
Relax. I'm just seeing if I can
help with something.

43:02.760 --> 43:06.036
Well, you can't. It's very delicate
equipment, so just stay away.

43:06.200 --> 43:09.112
All right? Stay away from the truck.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.430
- What?
- Stay away from my fucking truck!

43:12.600 --> 43:14.670
Okay, stop it.

43:16.440 --> 43:17.759
Backing away.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.113
Backing away.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.232
Someone give the geek his Ritalin.

43:23.400 --> 43:24.913
At least he's doing his job...

43:25.080 --> 43:28.789
..which is more than I can say
for some people. Tape her up and gag her.

43:28.960 --> 43:30.951
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!

43:31.120 --> 43:33.236
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!

43:33.400 --> 43:35.789
I want my daddy! I want my daddy!

43:35.960 --> 43:38.235
- I want my daddy!
- Let go of me!

43:38.400 --> 43:40.118
- Shut up!
- I want my daddy!

43:40.280 --> 43:42.191
- I want my daddy!
- Waste of time.

43:42.360 --> 43:44.476
I can think of a way of shutting you up.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.078
Yes!

43:49.400 --> 43:51.834
Shit! She's got the key!

44:44.520 --> 44:46.238
- Precious Daria.
- What's up, Odion?

44:46.400 --> 44:48.118
Long time, no see.

44:48.280 --> 44:52.114
- So, what brings you around here?
- Sometimes you need to see old friends.

44:52.640 --> 44:55.074
- What? You got trouble?
- With a capital T.

44:55.720 --> 44:59.474
Tony Fait? Thought you two
were tight. Bonnie and Clyde.

45:00.520 --> 45:02.397
Yeah, it used to be that way.

45:02.560 --> 45:04.437
Not taking care of me these days.

45:05.480 --> 45:08.677
Kid's all he cares about.
It's a shame, huh?

45:08.840 --> 45:12.515
- So, what you want me to do?
- I don't know.

45:12.920 --> 45:15.480
Probably nothing you can do.
I just thought...

45:15.640 --> 45:16.959
..you know.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.357
This is crazy. I don't even know what I
was thinking. I shouldn't be in here. Sorry.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.034
No, hold up, hold up. Girls.

45:26.200 --> 45:30.591
- Give us a minute. Champagne?
- Yes.

45:34.200 --> 45:35.679
I got it.

45:36.400 --> 45:40.632
- So you looking for a job?
- I need something.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.711
How about you work here?

45:44.640 --> 45:48.110
How would Jump feel about me
coming back and all?

45:48.280 --> 45:51.397
You let me worry about Jump Chambers.
In the meantime...

45:52.280 --> 45:56.193
..how about we go to my office
and we talk about this a little bit more?

45:57.880 --> 46:01.077
It's not exactly boxing matches,
it's a lot more dangerous.

46:01.240 --> 46:03.310
No gloves or nothing, no rules, period.

46:03.480 --> 46:07.632
It's huge money. It's very illegal.
They hold it during the day to fool cops.

46:07.800 --> 46:10.837
The man you remember,
how do you know he'll be here?

46:11.000 --> 46:14.834
I don't, but this is Chambers' operation,
so it's a damn good place to start.

46:15.240 --> 46:16.832
Here we are.

46:18.760 --> 46:21.911
- This is a private club. You can't come in.
- It's me, Archie.

46:22.080 --> 46:25.834
- Everybody likes me here.
- Hey, it's that asshole Archie again.

46:27.040 --> 46:28.598
How can you recognize him?

46:28.760 --> 46:31.957
Well, I didn't see his face,
but they all kind of look the same.

46:32.120 --> 46:34.031
Of course so do you guys.

46:34.400 --> 46:37.949
No offense. But I will remember
that pinky ring because it was awesome.

46:38.120 --> 46:42.318
He's got, like, a 10-carat, round cut,
square setting, good color and clarity.

46:42.480 --> 46:46.109
I remember thinking about the damage
it'd do to my face if he hit me.

46:54.360 --> 46:58.273
I gotta make sure Mr. Pinky Ring doesn't
recognize me, so I got a disguise.

46:58.440 --> 47:01.557
- How do we get in?
- Leave it to me. I'll take care of it.

47:01.720 --> 47:05.872
Hey, buddy. How you doing? How's
that armor-plated Lincoln I sold you?

47:06.040 --> 47:08.270
- Cops stopped me.
- They do that sometimes.

47:08.440 --> 47:10.192
- Car was fucking hot, Archie.
- Hey.

47:10.720 --> 47:14.349
I didn't steal it, but stop by the shop
tomorrow. I'll make it right.

47:14.520 --> 47:16.590
- You know the rules. No guests.
- He's not.

47:16.760 --> 47:18.671
He's a fighter. An unofficial entry.

47:19.080 --> 47:21.071
- Him? Is he any good?
- Is he...?

47:21.240 --> 47:23.196
He'll kick all those chumps' asses!

47:23.360 --> 47:25.396
He'll go Chinese on them!
Teeth will fly.

47:25.560 --> 47:28.120
Blood will splatter!
It'll be awesome! Step aside.

47:28.280 --> 47:29.952
No way, Archie. No more favors.

47:30.120 --> 47:32.509
What? You've got to be shitting me.

47:32.680 --> 47:36.116
Somebody's getting a letter from
the Better Business Bureau.

47:36.280 --> 47:38.032
Excuse us.

47:41.280 --> 47:43.669
You're number 12.
Go get your ass kicked.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.559
I didn't come here to fight.

47:49.720 --> 47:52.518
You don't have to fight,
I just said that to get us in.

48:10.720 --> 48:12.278
Come on!

48:14.400 --> 48:16.914
Get up! Oh, yeah.

48:17.360 --> 48:18.554
Get up!

48:21.000 --> 48:22.194
Yeah! Yeah!

48:22.360 --> 48:24.112
Tear his eye out!

48:27.080 --> 48:30.390
- On a good day, over a million
bucks will... - Just find the ring.

48:30.560 --> 48:34.189
- All right. Okay.
- Knock him out.

48:34.960 --> 48:36.916
- You know...
- Bullshit.

48:37.080 --> 48:41.790
..this could take a little while.
All right, come on. Let's go.

49:01.800 --> 49:02.789
Sit down.

49:16.440 --> 49:18.670
Why don't you put on some music?

49:23.480 --> 49:24.833
Slower.

49:28.200 --> 49:30.156
Just relax.

49:31.320 --> 49:32.719
And watch.

49:51.320 --> 49:52.878
This looks good.

49:54.520 --> 49:56.636
Set it up, tie it at the bottom.

49:56.800 --> 50:02.397
- Tommy, go.
- Here come the bug man.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.188
Excuse me.

50:18.360 --> 50:20.430
Hey, what's going on, player?

50:27.680 --> 50:31.229
- Yo, what the hell are you doing?
- Oh, pest control, player.

50:33.800 --> 50:36.633
- Don't tell me you didn't get the notice.
- What notice?

50:36.800 --> 50:41.078
That's what burn my ass to the bone,
a brother just trying to make a living...

50:41.240 --> 50:43.629
You know what?
That's beside the point.

50:43.800 --> 50:47.190
If you had gotten your notice, you'd
realize the city has a new ordinance...

50:47.360 --> 50:50.113
..saying I gotta spray businesses
catering to foreigners.

50:50.280 --> 50:51.508
How come?

50:51.680 --> 50:55.229
The foreigners are bringing over
them scary-ass foreign bugs, man.

50:55.400 --> 50:59.552
They coming here in their luggage. It's
my job to prevent possible infestation...

50:59.720 --> 51:02.917
..and contamination. That's my job.
- We doing business inside.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.878
I can't let you come and hose
the place with bug spray.

51:06.040 --> 51:10.033
Maybe you need to talk to your manager
about that plan because that's my job.

51:10.200 --> 51:13.431
- Manager's busy.
- Okay, that's your call.

51:13.600 --> 51:15.158
That is your call, player.

51:15.960 --> 51:17.951
But just remember this.

51:18.120 --> 51:20.270
First thing tomorrow morning...

51:20.440 --> 51:21.714
..the city...

51:22.360 --> 51:25.875
..they'll send their quarantine people.
- Quarantine people?

51:26.040 --> 51:28.076
They gonna shut you down.
Non-compliance.

51:28.240 --> 51:30.470
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

51:30.640 --> 51:33.393
Hold, man, come here.
Let me talk to you for a minute.

51:36.960 --> 51:39.155
You ain't fucking with me, are you?

51:41.600 --> 51:43.636
See that little motherfucker up there?

51:43.800 --> 51:45.438
That's me. That's me.

51:46.200 --> 51:50.671
I am a licensed exterminator, man.
Why I gotta fuck with you?

51:51.200 --> 51:54.510
Look. Come here. Let's do this.

51:54.680 --> 51:57.911
You take me to a small place.
Small room. Office or something.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.310
Someplace upstairs,
away from the customers.

52:00.480 --> 52:04.712
That way when I set these bombs off,
the fumes, they don't go down there.

52:04.880 --> 52:08.190
And then we come back later
and fix the rest. All right?

52:09.040 --> 52:12.430
- Okay. Get a couple bombs. Come on.
- That's what I'm talking about.

52:12.600 --> 52:15.353
You don't wanna be bit by one
of these motherfuckers.

52:15.520 --> 52:19.752
Swell you up all around the neck. Look
like Oprah. Come on, get the door.

54:01.720 --> 54:05.554
You know, some of these bugs
they got E. Coli and Mad Cow disease.

54:05.720 --> 54:09.759
Check this shit out.
Is this Jackie Chan's office?

54:10.680 --> 54:12.511
Oh, snap!

54:13.120 --> 54:14.951
Man, you got a Jacuzzi?

54:15.120 --> 54:17.554
Look at the ball.
How many freaks you get in here?

54:17.720 --> 54:21.110
I bet you sit yours right there on
that ball. Sit on the ball, baby.

54:21.280 --> 54:24.238
Sit on the ball. Keep it wet, baby.

54:24.400 --> 54:26.834
- Smack! Smack it! Smack it!
- Hey! Hey!

54:27.000 --> 54:30.754
- Just do your thing and go, bro.
- Yeah, all right, player.

54:35.800 --> 54:38.519
All right. Look here.
Now you keep the door closed...

54:38.680 --> 54:42.832
..and give this shit a full hour
before anybody steps in here, all right?

54:43.000 --> 54:44.228
Damn.

54:47.040 --> 54:48.598
Damn.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.592
<i>- You're clear.
- Let's do it.</i>

54:52.760 --> 54:54.352
All right.

55:06.720 --> 55:09.075
- You're crazy.
- I'm a father.

55:44.160 --> 55:46.196
<i>- Blow it.
- Daria...</i>

55:46.360 --> 55:47.759
<i>...get ready to move.</i>

55:53.560 --> 55:55.198
What was that?

55:56.120 --> 55:58.236
"Sometimes you just need
an old friend?"

56:03.520 --> 56:07.035
- It came from the office.
- Watch her. Don't let her leave.

56:16.280 --> 56:17.872
- They're not here?
- They're here.

56:18.040 --> 56:20.918
- They're just somewhere else.
- What are you talking about?

56:21.080 --> 56:24.311
- He stashed them here somewhere.
- What the hell we gonna do?

56:24.480 --> 56:27.040
- Everybody just go.
- But, T, what about you, man?

56:27.680 --> 56:30.353
I gotta save Vanessa. I gotta find them!

56:30.520 --> 56:32.670
- I'm not leaving you.
- Yes, you are. Now go!

56:33.280 --> 56:35.748
- Right here. Hurry up. Come on.
- Oh, shit.

56:35.920 --> 56:37.876
Come on, dog. They're right outside.

56:38.040 --> 56:40.429
Shut the fuck up and get out of here!

56:48.080 --> 56:50.116
You know, I got the big one.

56:50.760 --> 56:52.830
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

56:58.680 --> 57:00.159
Keep it in your pants.

57:00.640 --> 57:01.959
Who's in there?

57:16.120 --> 57:17.792
You're wrong.

57:22.760 --> 57:24.239
What you want?

57:25.440 --> 57:27.954
- Yeah!
- Move away from him. Come on.

57:31.440 --> 57:37.231
Nice cubic. Yours are real. Not.
I told you this was gonna take a while.

57:37.400 --> 57:40.358
I was thinking about those diamonds
so I made a few calls.

57:40.520 --> 57:43.796
My Defense Department connection
called me back and he tells me...

57:43.960 --> 57:49.637
..about this rumor out of Taiwan about
these stones. Only they're not jewels.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.309
- Pretty beat up.
- Fell down the stairs.

57:57.480 --> 57:58.754
Enjoy the jail sex, Fait.

58:03.960 --> 58:09.398
7 advances, 11 's out!
Next up, 8 versus 12!

58:10.200 --> 58:11.474
8 versus 12!

58:12.360 --> 58:14.510
Fighters report to the cage!

58:16.080 --> 58:17.274
Let's go.

58:24.120 --> 58:25.758
We're still here, T.

58:25.920 --> 58:28.115
Got anything you want us to do?

58:28.720 --> 58:31.109
- Nothing yet.
- What?

58:31.280 --> 58:33.316
Nothing. Nothing.

58:46.120 --> 58:48.839
Unofficial entry number 12!

58:49.000 --> 58:53.596
- Unofficial entry number 12!
- Hey, 12's right here!

58:53.760 --> 58:55.637
Kind of small, ain't he?

58:58.200 --> 58:59.474
Let's go, chickenshit.

58:59.760 --> 59:01.591
You're the chickenshit, buddy!

59:02.040 --> 59:03.678
Not today.

59:04.160 --> 59:07.311
I know this wasn't the plan,
but if you don't get in and fight...

59:07.480 --> 59:10.199
..they'll throw us out
and we'll never find this guy.

59:11.320 --> 59:13.072
- Sorry.
- Just find the ring.

59:22.400 --> 59:25.790
- Hey. Two grand on the white guy.
- You got it, Archie.

59:25.960 --> 59:27.632
Let's go! Come on!

59:27.800 --> 59:29.392
Are you ready? Are you ready?

59:58.040 --> 59:59.632
You win.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.191
- You suck.
- Shit.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.397
No quitting! Get your ass back in there!

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.874
Put me down! Goddamn! Come on!

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.469
- Put me down or I'll kick your ass, Bruce!
- I'm not Bruce.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.632
Come on. Get up. Get out of here.
Get out of here.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.108
Kick his ass!

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.872
Come on! Kick his ass!

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.632
Kick him. Take him down.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.313
- Okay. He's all patched up.
- Ready to move.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.274
Let's go.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.193
Get the car. Stay close.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.078
Hey! That guy's got my fucking quad!

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.758
I'm gonna get that motherfucker!

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.757
Hey! Wait!

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.630
Five grand on the Chinaman.
He's my friend.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.348
<i>At this very moment, a man
identified as Anthony Fait is leading...</i>

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.876
<i>...police on a wild high-speed chase
through downtown Los Angeles.</i>

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.396
<i>And get this, folks.
He's driving an all-terrain vehicle.</i>

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.159
Yeah!

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.790
Come on! Kick his ass!

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.117
Oh, yeah!

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.553
Come on. Come on down.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.038
That's the way to get that buck.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.993
<i>- Yo.
- I'm here.</i>

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.754
<i>Aboveground parking garage
in Chinatown. Get there.</i>

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.598
I know the place.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.916
Hey. Thanks, man.

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.674
- Do you like my new ring?
- Where is he?

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.592
Well, open the door.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.958
Glad I brought my stunner.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:13.635
All right, bud. You ready for the q and a?
Where'd you put the stones?

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.237
I ain't selling you shit till
I know where the ceiling is.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.154
How much money
do you want for the stones?

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.629
- Where's my fucking butter?
- It's almost ready.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.911
See, I hate foreplay. Fucking warm-up.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.436
A bitch gotta be ready to come off
the bench and score some points.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:38.196
Just take the rock to the motherfucking
hoop strong. You dig?

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:44.749
Instead of doing this back-and-forth shit,
my idea is you come up with a number.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:48.754
A very high number. You see,
I'm throwing a number so high...

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:54.236
..that when I hear it just...
It just gets me off.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:59.030
And then, bam! Bust a nut,
roll over, go to sleep.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.112
You like that?

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.473
Yeah, I like that.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.317
Oh, shit!

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.757
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.037
Shit! Okay, okay, okay!

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:22.194
<i>And it looks like this parking garage is
where it will end. As police have sealed...</i>

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:25.318
<i>...the building and continue
their search inside for the man who...</i>

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:29.029
<i>...led them on what certainly had to be
the most extreme chase we've ever seen.</i>

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.590
<i>- Don't know why these idiots do it.
- They never get away, do they?</i>

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.069
<i>They sure don't, and they just endanger
innocent citizens in the process.</i>

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.834
<i>Here's another car exiting the structure.</i>

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.117
<i>Police talking to the driver,
inspecting the vehicle.</i>

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:45.670
<i>Well, the police know they have him
trapped inside the parking structure.</i>

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.549
<i>Knowing cops the way I do, I can say
they're PO'd, excuse my language.</i>

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.756
<i>And they're not about to let this guy
slip through their fingers.</i>

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.478
Mr. Chambers is resting.
He says not to bother him.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.073
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.513
<i>Please don't go.</i>

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.591
<i>You want me to stay?</i>

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.354
<i>Yeah, I need someone to stay here
and help keep me awake.</i>

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.669
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.671
<i>I know that face.</i>

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.919
<i>A lot of men had that look on their face
when I got married.</i>

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.798
I knew the stones were in there.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.511
He was a tough guy, but when I got
close to his nuts he sang like C√©line Dion.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.870
How we gonna
get them out of there?

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.758
That place is always jumping.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.518
Yo, dog, something's not right.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:54.829
I got the same feeling.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.399
The doorman.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.029
Where is he?

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.912
Everybody stay put.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.118
- Sorry.
- Watch my nuts, all right?

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.672
No Chambers' guys.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.398
Something's wrong.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.237
This guy looks better dead.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.230
He said they were here in the fountain.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.558
Where are they?

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.838
This can't be fucking happening.
They have to be here!

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.234
That's it? One stone?

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.717
- Ling. He has the rest.
- How the fuck do you know?

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.709
I know.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.117
Okay. He has the stones.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.791
I mean, she can't hurt him.
She's just a little girl.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.074
She's only 8 years old. He'll let her
go, right? He'll just fucking let her go!

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.391
What am I gonna do?

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.238
We have to go.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.918
Now.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.795
- We're back in business.
- Good.

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.157
- We don't have to babysit much longer.
- I hate kids.

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.835
- Is everything else ready?
- Just have to test the device.

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.270
It's called the Dimaster Oscillator.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:13.719
Not test. Calibrate.
Which I'm now ready to do.

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.349
Goggles?

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.599
Here you go, man.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.315
Thanks.

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.512
Please work. Please work.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.594
Please work.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.156
Daddy, please. Daddy, please.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.476
Please answer, Daddy, answer.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.437
Want me to get that?

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.353
- Yeah?
- Daddy?

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.709
Vanessa?

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.878
<i>Daddy, please, come and get me...</i>

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.393
..I wanna go home!

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.672
Calm down, baby. Calm down.
Where are you?

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.869
<i>I don't know!</i>

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.349
I'm in a van inside a big building.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.556
<i>They painted the windows.
I can't look out!</i>

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.718
You gotta help me, sweetheart.
I have to know where you are.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.075
<i>- I'm scared!
- I know you are, honey.</i>

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.789
Just try to stay calm. Concentrate.
Look around. What do you see?

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.754
<i>I don't know. I can't see anything.</i>

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.718
You gotta try, sweetheart.
Try to see something.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.190
I'm going. I'm trying.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.997
I see chairs and green light.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.037
Chairs. Green light.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.833
Where's the light coming from?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.390
I can't tell. There's a machine.
It's like a laser show.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.671
<i>- Laser show?
- Daddy...</i>

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.068
..hurry! I'm scared!

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.356
<i>- I wanna go home!
- Okay, baby. Calm down.</i>

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.829
It's gonna be okay.
Daddy's coming!

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.389
Daddy?

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.232
<i>- Vanessa?
- Daddy!</i>

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.628
<i>Vanessa?</i>

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.189
Vanessa!

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.474
Great!

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.954
Shit!

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.556
- He's doing it here tonight.
- Doing what?

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:05.475
Selling the stones. The Thai laser emits
green light. He needs it to enrich them.

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.552
- To show their power.
- What the hell are you talking about?

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.039
What are these stones?

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.557
A new form of synthetic plutonium. Small,
portable, but mega-powerful. Am I right?

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:18.196
There's a bunch of international
scumbags who'd pay a lot of money...

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.193
..to get their hands on those.
And then, look out world.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.349
Enough of this shit!

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.313
How's it gonna get me
back my daughter?

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.389
We're operational.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:38.036
The buyers will want to arrive
and leave quickly.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.113
Somewhere private,
accessible by aircraft.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.589
Vanessa did say she was inside
of a big building.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.795
Could be a hangar.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.599
There's about a dozen
little airports around here, man.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.916
We ain't gonna never get them all.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.116
- Flight plans.
- Yeah, flight plans.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.590
They gotta list a destination.
Every aircraft that takes off...

01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.753
..has to file one with the Aviation
Administration or risk getting shot down...

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.309
..by the U.S. Military.
So you get that list...

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.040
..and maybe we can find out where
the sale's going down.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.875
Daria, call the aviation people.
Use our L.A.P.D. Credentials.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:13.032
We need flight info on all aircrafts
coming in or going out.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.590
Miles, the no-gun policy
is no longer in effect. Break out the heat.

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.799
Everybody else, get ready to move.
Tommy, create a diversion.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.871
I got just the thing if we can fit in it.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.390
Wick Airfield.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.678
Five private choppers arriving tonight
within minutes of each other.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.070
- Sounds like our best bet.
- Better be for Vanessa's sake.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.153
Let's go.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.560
You are the world's foremost
arms dealers.

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.032
You all know that weaponry equals power,
and in the world of weaponry...

01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.315
..nukes rule.

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:03.671
But nuclear material is hard to obtain
and difficult to handle.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.350
But what if it weren't?

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:09.114
That's the question that brought
you here tonight.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.033
And this is the answer.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:18.751
A unique, man-made element.
In its present state it's completely inert.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.078
Zero radiation...

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.112
..zero volatility.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.790
One small fragment easily transformed
into a source of immense energy.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.954
More powerful than weapons-grade
plutonium 100 times its size.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.074
Goggles on.

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.194
<i>So, what the hell does Taiwan
gotta do with this?</i>

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.954
<i>We developed the stones.
They belong to us.</i>

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.635
<i>Okay, what about the guy you're after?
How come you know him so well?</i>

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.792
<i>We grew up together. We joined
the government at the same time.</i>

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.758
<i>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You were on the same side?</i>

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.799
<i>He betrayed us. He killed our team.
He tried to kill me too.</i>

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.758
<i>If you don't take this
motherfucker out, I will.</i>

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:16.117
<i>The stones first, then him.</i>

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.478
Creating a highly reactive
radioactive isotope...

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.916
..requires altering the atomic structure
of the original material.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.037
Normally this is accomplished
by adding neutrons.

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:42.352
Here, we're using electromagnetic
distillation to strip away protons.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:47.799
In the process, the fragment's potential
yield is increasing exponentially.

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.596
We're now reaching the yield level
of a sidewinder missile.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.433
Enough power to take out a tank.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.438
A Tomahawk cruise missile,
enough to destroy a building.

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.549
Scud.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.548
That's a few city blocks gone.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.835
Hiroshima.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.596
Two Hiroshimas.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.395
New world order.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.068
The purpose of today's sale
is to begin trading...

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:09.438
..a new commodity on the black market
and to determine its value.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.360
There are 50 stones available
in the first sale.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.990
And the opening bid
is $200,000 per stone.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.439
Bids, please.

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.750
I'll bid one million for five stones.

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:26.159
- I'll bid 1.2 million for five stones.
- 1.5 for five stones.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.675
- 1.7 million for five stones.
- 2 million for three.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.956
- 5 million for six stones!
- 5.2 for six!

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.951
- 5.7 for six!
- Sold.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.634
- Seven million for 10 stones!
- 8.5 for 10!

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.629
Miles, what do you see?

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.752
We got five choppers.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.309
<i>Two armed sentries.</i>

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.594
<i>Checking the perimeter.</i>

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.037
<i>Perimeter is clear.</i>

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:56.028
I'm moving inside.
They're still doing the deal.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.954
There's a camper there.

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.472
<i>- And the windows is painted out.
- Vanessa said she was in a van.</i>

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.671
<i>Can't see out. It's gotta be it!</i>

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.671
Once we get her,
you two disappear fast.

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:09.909
I'll keep her safe.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:13.317
- 8.7 million for 10 stones!
- 9 million for 10 stones!

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.471
- 9.8 for 10.
- 10 million for 10 stones!

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.790
- Sold! There are 37 stones.
- 16 million!

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.959
Miles! Hit them!

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.593
Done.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.752
Tommy and Archie,
watch the van. Punch it!

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:31.149
- 24.5 for 15!
- 24 and three quarters...

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.594
25 for 15!

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.994
Freeze, motherfuckers!

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.949
I knew it.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.754
You heard the man. Party's over!

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.797
- I knew it.
- Just be cool.

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.872
Fucking amateurs.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.670
Come on, man, just be cool!

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.637
I said, don't move, motherfucker!

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.636
She's out! She's out!
She's on the move.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.079
Another time.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.197
<i>- There's a guy after her.
- Stay right here. I'll go get her.</i>

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.232
- Holy shit!
- Come to Papa!

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.831
Shit! That motherfucker's shooting!

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.432
- What do we do?
- Shoot him!

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.033
Easy for you to say!

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:10.909
You do him.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.553
Don't let him get away!

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.029
Oh, shit! Shit! Archie, I'm out of ammo!

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.475
- Fire the M-60!
- Get me closer!

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.109
Give me that!

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:09.029
How many times do we have to kill you?

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.554
Get him! I got this.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.193
Go! Go!

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.233
- Go!
- All right!

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.792
- What happened?
- I don't know!

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:09.989
We're out of balance!

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.156
Retract the landing gear! Do it!
Do it now!

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.399
Shoot him down!

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.152
Shit! I'm out of ammo! What now?

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.355
Shoot him down!

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.953
- Load the cannon.
- How?

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:32.396
- Put the giant bullet into the hole!
- Oh, shit.

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.549
Oh, shit!

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:45.230
- There he is! There he is! I got him!
- Archie, shoot this motherfucker!

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.509
We're hit!

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.153
- Hey! Hey!
- You shot him in the ass!

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.435
We got it!

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:33.789
Shit!

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.355
Time to end this my way.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.436
- Let her go!
- Let go! Daddy!

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.868
Daddy!

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.029
Daddy!

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.833
Damn! No shot.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.273
You were lucky last time.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.870
You won't be lucky again.

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.634
Daddy!

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:20.759
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:46.509
Wrong kid!

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.591
Definitely the wrong father!

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:43.277
- My baby!
- Daddy, I knew you'd find me!

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.237
So glad the angels kept you safe.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.634
Another one?

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.235
You know it.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:02.189
Never gonna let you go. Ever.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.315
Guess we both got what we wanted.

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:26.550
So, what happens to the stones now?

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.910
They'll be destroyed.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.956
Guess I'll be spending some time in jail.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.589
Jail?

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:41.039
Come on, man. He just saved the planet,
man. Can't he at least get probation?

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.355
I'll do what I can.

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:43.635
- Thanks.
- That's great.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:46.837
Because we make a hell of a team,
am I right? Except for you.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.560
You're law enforcement.
But we gotta stick together.

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:51.790
And a white guy comes in handy.

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:55.589
You wanna rip off a country club,
or somebody needs to hail a cab. Right?

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.910
- So, what percentage are we talking?
- None.

01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.752
That low, huh?

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:03.995
It's about time I got my shit together.

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.479
- About time we all did.
- I'm with you, T.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.079
Come on, buddy, it's just getting fun.

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.119
Well, I mean, you know,
it's not that fun...

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.276
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:23.515
Faith.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.709
Faith.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.114
Faith.

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.633
Faith.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:30.268
Faith.

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.829
So you guys are all just gonna
up and go straight?

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.150
Yeah. You ought to try it yourself, man.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:39.675
I could do it. I've had straight jobs.
Have you?

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:42.638
- I've had plenty of straight jobs.
- Really? Name one.

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.239
I sold Avon.

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.830
- You were an Avon lady?
- I was an Avon man. All right?

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.150
- You got a problem with that?
- No, it's fair.

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:54.357
- Why you looking at me like that?
- I'm not! I'm not! It's okay.

01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:00.630
I'm just fucking with you. But my mama
sold Avon. And don't be disrespecting her.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:03.360
- I know her. Remember the party?
- She whipped your ass.

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.999
No, she sucker-punched me.

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.152
That ain't the first time you
been sucker-punched by a big woman.

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.788
You know, I think
I got kind of a fetish.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.389
Did you just say my mama had a fat ass?

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:17.189
No, I said I have a kind
of a fetish for big women.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.432
- Oh. But she do got a fat ass though.
- Yeah, she does have a fat ass.

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:22.989
You can see it when she's sitting
on your head.

01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:26.630
I've seen it. I had to rub that ass
naked when I was a teenager.

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.917
You know, you look a lot like her.
Except her hair is different.

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:33.629
Yeah. I shave my beard,
she keeps hers growing.

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.791
- Yeah. You know what?
- What?

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:40.590
I'm gonna write a movie about all the shit
we got through. I've been taking notes.

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:43.718
<i>It's gonna make a lot of money.
I'm calling it Sidekicks.</i>

01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:47.236
We're the real stars of this.
We shot down the damn helicopter.

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:49.630
- Who's playing you?
- I've been thinking about that.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:52.951
First I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger,
then I saw him at the gas station...

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.439
- Midget.
- He's like 5'6".

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.397
- Midget.
- Got a terrible lisp.

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.994
So I'll go with Mel Gibson.
We have similar features.

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:00.798
Right. I see the forehead.

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.155
- Yeah. And you? Guess.
- Denzel!

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:04.355
Denzel!

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:07.796
- You noticed I've been cutting it down.
- And he's been beefing up.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.190
I'm trying to get down to
Denzel's weight.

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:12.475
Know who will be your girlfriend? Oprah.

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.551
- Big Oprah or little Oprah?
- Medium Oprah.

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.790
That's the one I like
because the eyes are straight.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.996
- This is about reality.
- Right. Realism.

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.230
- Yeah. So you know who's my girlfriend?
- Who?

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:25.075
Halle Berry. And let me tell you why.
It'll add a whole different element.

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:28.630
This is gonna be an interracial couple.
She's never done that before.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:32.759
Also, Fait. I've been thinking about
that a lot. I'll go with Shaquille O'Neal.

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:36.071
<i>The most dominating player ever
in the NBA. You saw Kazaam.</i>

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.276
- Right
- It wasn't the right material.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.035
He's gonna kill with this stuff.
And Su, I've been thinking about him.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.760
<i>- Remember the movie Sixteen Candles?
- Yeah.</i>

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.150
- Who am I thinking about?
- Molly Ringwald?

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.231
- No, the Donger!
- Oh! Okay!

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.868
How funny was that guy?
What happened to him?

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.270
- He waiting tables someplace.
- He was funny!

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:58.353
- Yeah, he was. Hey, Daria.
- Daria? Who you got?

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:01.159
- Winona Ryder.
- Yeah, she's good. She'd be good.

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:03.470
- Yeah, she's good.
- She'd play a thief.

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:06.712
She'd play a thief. She a good actress.
The whole elbow thing.

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:10.190
Remember when she's going to court
and hit the one elbow, broke that elbow.

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:14.035
- Electricity went through her body.
- She's a ventriloquist with the elbows.

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:16.350
Now who do we get to direct this thing?

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.035
You know what?

01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:22.353
<i>We should get the same dude that directed
Romeo Must Die and Exit Wounds.</i>

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:24.988
- The director, the Pole, Polack.
- The Polack?

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.799
<i>Yeah, we'll get him in there.
Exit Wounds, did you see that?</i>

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:29.473
- I saw that.
- The best part...

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:30.675
- The end.
- The very end.

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:34.799
- Over the credits. The rest sucked.
- Can't have the movie without the end.

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.918
- There's no movie.
- Whatever happened with those two guys?

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.195
I heard they're gay.

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.636
Yeah, of course. Hollywood.
