WEBVTT

00:04.167 --> 00:05.334
Kids, hurry up!

00:05.335 --> 00:06.500
You'll be late for school!

00:06.542 --> 00:07.647
We only have...

00:07.648 --> 00:08.751
Thirty minutes!

00:08.792 --> 00:10.168
The bus waited

00:10.169 --> 00:11.542
so long yesterday,

00:08.792 --> 00:11.542
a tow truck showed up!

00:12.876 --> 00:14.876
Okay, I'm ready for school.

00:14.918 --> 00:16.209
Where's my leaf project?

00:16.250 --> 00:17.334
You didn't do it?

00:17.335 --> 00:18.417
It's due today!

00:18.459 --> 00:20.542
Jessie, we have a deal.

00:20.584 --> 00:23.042
I put stuff off

00:23.043 --> 00:25.500
until the last minute,

00:20.584 --> 00:25.500
and you do it for me.

00:25.542 --> 00:26.710
I told you I wouldn't

00:26.711 --> 00:27.876
do that anymore

00:25.542 --> 00:27.876
after I had to play

00:27.918 --> 00:28.980
George Washington

00:28.981 --> 00:30.042
in your school's history

00:27.918 --> 00:30.042
pageant.

00:30.083 --> 00:31.918
By the way, nailed it.

00:32.918 --> 00:34.709
I cannot tell a lie...

00:34.751 --> 00:36.459
Your performance stunk!

00:37.083 --> 00:38.876
I had nothing to work with!

00:38.918 --> 00:40.480
The kid playing Martha

00:40.481 --> 00:42.042
was as wooden

00:38.918 --> 00:42.042
as my teeth!

00:42.083 --> 00:44.042
- Whatever,
- I'll come up with something.

00:44.083 --> 00:46.059
- That's what you said
- about your volcano project.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.000
And I got it done.

00:48.042 --> 00:49.209
You turned in a photo of a

00:49.210 --> 00:50.375
pimple on Bertram's back.

00:51.083 --> 00:52.918
It was perfect!

00:52.959 --> 00:54.876
- I caught it right before
- it erupted!

00:56.542 --> 00:57.793
All you had to do was collect

00:57.794 --> 00:59.042
and label 30 leaves.

00:59.083 --> 01:00.792
- You should've started this
- a week ago.

01:00.834 --> 01:02.126
You should've given me

01:02.127 --> 01:03.417
that advice a week ago.

01:03.459 --> 01:05.000
You're such a procrastinator.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.751
Jessie, major crisis!

01:08.792 --> 01:09.894
- Two different guys
- just asked me

01:09.918 --> 01:11.834
- To the Walden carnival
- this afternoon.

01:11.876 --> 01:13.918
- Are they both horrible jerks
- with dead end jobs,

01:13.959 --> 01:15.834
- Who make you
- pick up the check

01:15.876 --> 01:16.938
Because they left

01:16.939 --> 01:18.000
their wallet

01:15.876 --> 01:18.000
in their girlfriend's car?

01:18.584 --> 01:19.876
No...

01:19.918 --> 01:22.042
Then I can't relate.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.188
Get dressed.

01:23.189 --> 01:24.292
We only have

01:22.083 --> 01:24.292
29 minutes.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.584
How can I pick an outfit

01:25.585 --> 01:26.834
when I haven't picked a date?

01:26.876 --> 01:28.518
- Besides, I don't have
- anything to wear!

01:28.542 --> 01:30.042
Your closet is like a mall.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.751
It has an escalator.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.959
And a food court!

01:34.000 --> 01:35.500
Now get up there, get dressed,

01:35.501 --> 01:37.000
and bring me back one

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
of those big soft pretzels.

01:39.083 --> 01:41.000
Luke? Any chance you're ready?

01:42.083 --> 01:43.083
Almost.

01:43.876 --> 01:45.334
(YAWNING)

01:45.375 --> 01:46.397
Did you stay up all night

01:46.398 --> 01:47.417
watching movies again?

01:47.459 --> 01:48.689
No. I played some video

01:48.690 --> 01:49.918
games, too.

01:50.876 --> 01:52.000
Get dressed.

01:52.042 --> 01:53.918
No problem. I'm on it.

01:53.959 --> 01:54.959
No, no, no.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.876
Why is it always so difficult

01:58.877 --> 02:00.667
to get you guys

01:57.083 --> 02:00.667
out the door on time?

02:00.709 --> 02:01.855
My art class project is

02:01.856 --> 02:03.000
complete,

02:03.042 --> 02:05.375
and, as usual, I am ready.

03:20.083 --> 03:21.459
I would do a better job

of getting the kids

For 25 minutes,

03:56.169 --> 03:57.751
so can you please grab us

03:54.584 --> 03:57.751
breakfast at the deli?

03:57.792 --> 03:59.397
You mean actually go out

03:59.398 --> 04:01.000
and gather food myself?

04:01.334 --> 04:03.000
Like a caveman?

04:05.083 --> 04:06.834
- Or better yet,
- you can grab some food

04:06.876 --> 04:08.292
- At the snack stand
- in the park,

04:08.334 --> 04:09.543
And take Zuri with you,

04:09.544 --> 04:10.751
so she can collect her leaves.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.709
- No way.
- Going outside before noon

I stand for.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.083
Zuri, are you rea...

04:18.084 --> 04:19.084
Uh-oh.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.084
There's no good answer to

04:21.084 --> 04:23.042
this, but what's the rope for?

04:23.083 --> 04:25.042
I saw a nice leafy plant on

04:25.043 --> 04:27.000
Mrs. Chesterfield's terrace...

04:27.751 --> 04:29.709
(GRUNTING)

04:29.751 --> 04:30.897
So I lassoed it,

04:30.898 --> 04:32.042
and I'm bringing it up!

04:35.167 --> 04:36.543
You know, there is a park

04:36.544 --> 04:37.918
across the street.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.709
- You know what you can
- find there?

04:39.751 --> 04:43.626
Tourists? Muggers? Mimes?

04:43.667 --> 04:45.355
Am I getting warm?

04:45.356 --> 04:47.042
'Cause I got some leaves

04:43.667 --> 04:47.042
to collect!

04:47.083 --> 04:49.226
- I know, that's why Bertram's
- taking you to the park.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.918
They have these

04:50.919 --> 04:52.584
giant leaf holders there

04:49.250 --> 04:52.584
called trees!

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
- Okay, guess
- I won't be needing this then.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.834
Sorry, Zeus!

Jessie, I cannot recreate my

05:05.981 --> 05:08.042
plaster mask of Mrs. Kipling.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.000
- It takes five minutes
- to harden,

05:10.042 --> 05:11.459
And she refuses

05:11.460 --> 05:12.876
to sit still for it again.

05:12.918 --> 05:13.939
Maybe you could bribe her

05:13.940 --> 05:14.959
with a rat?

05:15.959 --> 05:18.000
She is a penthouse lizard now.

05:18.042 --> 05:19.042
She only eats rats

05:19.043 --> 05:20.043
that are slow-roasted

05:20.083 --> 05:21.147
in an heirloom

05:21.148 --> 05:22.209
tomato reduction.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.000
And I do not have the time.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.042
You could just tie her down...

05:27.083 --> 05:30.000
(SNARLING)

05:30.042 --> 05:31.918
- Or we could find
- another model...

05:32.959 --> 05:35.042
Who can't eat us.

05:35.083 --> 05:37.042
- Fine with me.
- Any suggestions?

05:37.083 --> 05:39.000
(LUKE SNORING)

05:43.375 --> 05:45.042
- Are you thinking
- what I'm thinking?

05:45.083 --> 05:47.204
- That Luke should be checked
- for a deviated septum?

05:48.250 --> 05:49.772
Yes, but also

05:49.773 --> 05:51.292
he can be your model.

05:51.334 --> 05:52.688
Now get to work,

05:52.689 --> 05:54.042
before he wakes up.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.501
I cannot make a mold

05:55.502 --> 05:56.918
of Luke's face

05:54.083 --> 05:56.918
without permission.

05:56.959 --> 05:58.667
- Then you'll have
- to turn it in late.

05:58.709 --> 06:00.042
You can't get an A every time.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.918
- I didn't,
- and look at me now.

06:01.959 --> 06:04.000
I will get the plaster.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.042
Emma, you'd better be dressed!

06:09.083 --> 06:10.355
You have to be out the door

06:10.356 --> 06:11.626
in 22 minutes!

06:12.792 --> 06:13.897
I still haven't decided

06:13.898 --> 06:15.000
who to go out with.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.397
Michael's a preppy,

06:16.398 --> 06:17.751
but Blake's a leather jacket

06:15.042 --> 06:17.751
kind of guy.

06:17.792 --> 06:19.376
There's nothing

06:19.377 --> 06:20.959
I can wear that goes

06:17.792 --> 06:20.959
with both those looks.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.480
Okay, how about you make

06:22.481 --> 06:23.959
a pro and con list?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.480
Good idea.

06:25.481 --> 06:26.959
Ooh, do I have enough glitter?

06:33.083 --> 06:34.251
The guy at the snack stand

06:34.252 --> 06:35.417
hadn't started cooking yet,

06:35.459 --> 06:36.606
so all I got was

06:36.607 --> 06:37.751
a bunch of ingredients.

06:37.792 --> 06:39.876
But, like I always say,

06:39.877 --> 06:41.959
when life gives you eggs,

06:37.792 --> 06:41.959
make a frittata.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.375
You never say that.

06:44.334 --> 06:46.042
- So, did you get
- all your leaves?

06:46.083 --> 06:47.480
Yep. I grabbed everything

06:47.481 --> 06:48.876
I saw that was green.

06:48.918 --> 06:50.022
If we pass a kid looking

06:50.023 --> 06:51.125
for his lunch money,

06:51.167 --> 06:53.000
keep walking.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.751
Ravi, be careful with that.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.083
You don't wanna wake him up.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.459
Impossible.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.772
Remember our trip to the

07:02.773 --> 07:04.042

07:05.918 --> 07:07.355
By the way,

07:07.356 --> 07:08.792
terrible vacation idea.

07:08.834 --> 07:10.126
Hey, they gave out free

07:10.127 --> 07:11.417
drill bits and stud finders.

07:11.459 --> 07:13.292
Huh? What's going on?

07:15.083 --> 07:18.083
Wait a minute. I can't see.

Oh, no! Aliens have

07:20.023 --> 07:21.918
landed and stolen my eyeballs!

07:23.042 --> 07:24.959
- Or there is cotton
- on your eyes.

07:28.918 --> 07:30.959
Is this glue on my face?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.480
Luke, I would never allow Ravi

07:32.481 --> 07:33.959
to put glue on your face

07:31.000 --> 07:33.959
while you slept.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.292
It's quick-drying plaster.

You are what we

07:44.378 --> 07:46.918
in the plaster business

07:41.834 --> 07:46.918
call "mold gold."

07:46.959 --> 07:47.980
Don't worry, Luke.

07:47.981 --> 07:49.000
The mask is completely

07:46.959 --> 07:49.000
harmless.

07:49.042 --> 07:51.000
Then why didn't you do it?

07:51.042 --> 07:52.894
- Are you kidding? - I'm not gonna risk
- My moneymaker.

07:52.918 --> 07:54.042
(WATCH BEEPING)

07:54.083 --> 07:54.959
The five minutes are up.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.022
I will pop this off

07:56.023 --> 07:57.042
in a jiffy.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.918
- Uh, are you sure
- it won't hurt?

07:58.959 --> 08:00.292
Everything will be fine.

08:01.083 --> 08:02.083
(GRUNTING)

08:05.334 --> 08:06.834
Uh-oh.

08:08.042 --> 08:09.042
"Uh-oh," what?

08:09.043 --> 08:10.043
Why isn't it coming off?

08:10.083 --> 08:12.292
Uh, there is a small chance

08:12.334 --> 08:14.127
that in my haste,

08:14.128 --> 08:15.918
I forgot to apply

08:12.334 --> 08:15.918
the non-adhesive base.

08:16.417 --> 08:18.000
Whoopsie.

08:19.209 --> 08:20.209
Whoopsie?

08:21.083 --> 08:23.083
Now, now, don't overreact.

08:23.125 --> 08:25.042
I'm not going to overreact.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.042
I'm going to panic!

08:27.083 --> 08:29.334
Be careful with my mask!

08:29.375 --> 08:30.688
Uh, could you try to panic

08:30.689 --> 08:32.000
from the neck down?

08:36.417 --> 08:38.500
- You guys are going to be late!
- Pull harder!

08:38.542 --> 08:40.542
I am trying to be gentle.

08:40.583 --> 08:41.792
There's no time to be gentle!

08:41.793 --> 08:43.000
I'm getting a crowbar.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.272
No, please! I need

08:45.273 --> 08:46.459
this face in one piece.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.959
And I need the one under it!

08:49.083 --> 08:50.083
I got the groceries!

08:50.084 --> 08:51.084
I got the leaves!

08:51.125 --> 08:53.042
Breakfast is coming up.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.542
Great! I'm starving.

08:54.584 --> 08:56.435
- I'll just blend yours up,
- and you can drink it

08:56.459 --> 08:58.000
- Through one
- of your nose straws.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.209
EMMA: Jessie!

09:00.250 --> 09:02.042
- Emma, do I need
- to remind you that

09:02.083 --> 09:03.147
You're one tardy away

09:03.148 --> 09:04.209
from being suspended?

09:04.250 --> 09:05.918
- If you keep asking me
- questions,

09:05.959 --> 09:07.418
I'm going to be late,

09:07.419 --> 09:08.876
and it'll be all your fault!

09:09.626 --> 09:12.292
Stay calm, stay calm.

09:12.334 --> 09:13.397
Ravi, try not to hurt

09:13.398 --> 09:14.459
your brother.

09:14.500 --> 09:15.602
- If you need me,
- I'll be upstairs,

09:15.626 --> 09:17.000
- Trying not
- to hurt your sister.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.500
Emma, what is taking

09:21.501 --> 09:23.000
so much... Glitter.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.042
- I did exactly
- what you suggested

09:26.083 --> 09:27.542
And made pro and con lists

09:27.543 --> 09:29.000
for my two potential dates.

09:29.042 --> 09:30.542
Okay... I'm starting to see

09:30.543 --> 09:32.042
the cons of suggesting that.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.042
Michael's pros are

09:34.043 --> 09:36.000
he's super-sweet, smart,

09:32.083 --> 09:36.000
and easy to talk to.

09:36.959 --> 09:39.000
On the con side...

09:42.042 --> 09:43.542
He's okay looking.

09:43.543 --> 09:45.042
Why do you have his picture

09:42.042 --> 09:45.042
under cons?

09:45.083 --> 09:47.000
Because this is Blake...

09:50.542 --> 09:52.480
Whoa, that is a giant pro.

09:52.481 --> 09:54.417
Does he have an older bro?

09:54.459 --> 09:56.209
- I don't know.
- I hope so.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.000
- Are we done?
- Yes. Sorry.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.042
So, what are his cons?

10:00.083 --> 10:02.063
Well, he's a little

10:02.064 --> 10:04.042
self-absorbed,

10:04.083 --> 10:05.292
not the best listener,

10:05.293 --> 10:06.500
and he's always running late.

10:06.542 --> 10:08.021
Yeah. I can see how annoying

10:08.022 --> 10:09.500
that might be.

10:09.542 --> 10:12.021
Oh, and sometimes the sparkle

10:12.022 --> 10:14.500
from his smile can get

10:09.542 --> 10:14.500
a little blinding.

10:14.542 --> 10:15.876
Emma, just pick one.

10:15.877 --> 10:17.209
They both seem fine,

10:17.250 --> 10:18.480
and it's not like you're

10:18.481 --> 10:19.709
going to marry

10:17.250 --> 10:19.709
either of these guys.

10:19.751 --> 10:21.667
- This is more important
- than marriage.

10:21.709 --> 10:24.125
This is high school!

10:24.167 --> 10:25.334
You're just staying

10:25.335 --> 10:26.500
after school for a carnival.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.480
It's basically detention

10:28.481 --> 10:30.417
with snow cones!

10:30.459 --> 10:32.251
Now, I am going to carefully

10:32.252 --> 10:34.042
pry the mask from your face.

10:34.083 --> 10:36.167
Remain perfectly still

10:36.168 --> 10:38.250
and please remember,

10:34.083 --> 10:38.250
skin grows back.

10:39.751 --> 10:41.209
(STRUGGLING)

10:41.250 --> 10:43.126
Hey, wait!

10:43.127 --> 10:45.000
That's my stainless steel

10:41.250 --> 10:45.000
Easy Grip 3000!

10:45.042 --> 10:47.042
That's not very sanitary!

10:49.083 --> 10:50.897
Okay, kids, chew

10:50.898 --> 10:52.709
as quickly as you can,

10:52.751 --> 10:54.334
- without biting
- your tongues off.

10:54.375 --> 10:55.500
Hey! Where's mine?

10:55.542 --> 10:57.125
One frittata smoothie. Enjoy.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.083
Uh...

11:04.792 --> 11:06.042
Ooh, cheesy!

11:07.083 --> 11:08.584
Zuri, aren't you going to eat?

11:08.626 --> 11:09.813
As soon as I get these leaves

11:09.814 --> 11:11.000
glued on the poster.

11:13.584 --> 11:16.042
Wait, these aren't my leaves.

11:16.083 --> 11:18.042
- That's the spinach
- I bought in the park!

11:18.083 --> 11:19.897
Well, if that's the spinach,

11:19.898 --> 11:21.709
then what's

11:18.083 --> 11:21.709
in the spinach frittata?

11:21.751 --> 11:23.376
Oh, no! You're all eating

11:23.377 --> 11:25.000
my homework!

11:26.083 --> 11:27.083
(COUGHING)

11:29.125 --> 11:31.459
Luke, did you not hear Zuri?

11:31.500 --> 11:32.584
Whatever. It's just some

11:32.585 --> 11:33.667
leaves.

11:33.709 --> 11:35.460
I also collected

11:35.461 --> 11:37.209
some caterpillars

11:33.709 --> 11:37.209
for next week's project.

11:40.542 --> 11:41.709
(ALL MOANING)

11:44.709 --> 11:46.792
Jessie, this is a disaster!

11:46.834 --> 11:49.042
What am I gonna do?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.272
How 'bout doing your

11:50.273 --> 11:51.459
assignments on time

11:49.083 --> 11:51.459
from now on?

11:51.500 --> 11:52.751
How 'bout people

11:52.752 --> 11:54.000
stop cooking my work?

11:56.667 --> 11:57.751
Jessie,

11:57.752 --> 11:58.834
I don't know what to do.

11:58.876 --> 12:00.147
Maybelle just texted me,

12:00.148 --> 12:01.417
and Justin asked her

11:58.876 --> 12:01.417
to the carnival,

12:01.459 --> 12:02.852
- but his sister used to date
- the cousin

12:02.876 --> 12:04.351
- Of Blake's ex-girlfriend's
- dog-walker.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.709
So if Maybelle says

12:05.710 --> 12:07.042
yes to Justin,

12:04.375 --> 12:07.042
and I say yes to Blake,

12:07.083 --> 12:08.751
this could get complicated!

12:10.125 --> 12:11.272
Yeah, we wouldn't want

12:11.273 --> 12:12.417
that to happen!

12:12.459 --> 12:14.667
Jessie, I'm scared!

12:14.709 --> 12:16.772
I have a cement face,

12:16.773 --> 12:18.834
and I just stuffed

12:14.709 --> 12:18.834
it with caterpillars.

12:18.876 --> 12:20.126
Okay, don't worry.

12:20.127 --> 12:21.375
I'm sure Ravi can get

12:18.876 --> 12:21.375
the plaster off.

12:21.417 --> 12:22.709
And those bugs were good,

12:22.710 --> 12:24.000
free-range protein.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.334
He's sharpening stuff!

12:31.626 --> 12:33.000
- You'll be fine.
- Wha...

12:34.542 --> 12:36.751
Okay, let's make this fast.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.084
Look! I found an app that

12:38.085 --> 12:39.375
takes pictures of two people

12:39.417 --> 12:40.730
and creates a rendering

12:40.731 --> 12:42.042
of what their future

12:39.417 --> 12:42.042
kids might look like.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.268
- I wonder if there's
- an app that shows

12:43.292 --> 12:44.480
What punctual kids

12:44.481 --> 12:45.667
might look like.

12:45.709 --> 12:46.876
So if Michael and I got

12:46.877 --> 12:48.042
married someday,

12:48.083 --> 12:49.334
this would be our child...

12:49.375 --> 12:50.375
(BEEPING)

12:52.292 --> 12:54.250
Ew.

12:54.292 --> 12:55.501
He's definitely not going

12:55.502 --> 12:56.709
to be on a baby-food jar.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.000
Unless it's for baby trolls.

13:02.334 --> 13:05.000
Hey! That's my troll baby!

13:06.209 --> 13:07.667
Sorry.

13:08.709 --> 13:10.396
On the other hand,

13:10.397 --> 13:12.083
if Blake and I get married

13:08.709 --> 13:12.083
someday...

13:12.125 --> 13:13.626
This will be our baby.

13:21.918 --> 13:23.001
Imagine what he'd look like

13:23.002 --> 13:24.083
with glitter.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.188
This is a bad idea.

13:29.189 --> 13:30.292

13:30.334 --> 13:31.917
Okay, I'm still

13:31.918 --> 13:33.500
a little blinded from

13:30.334 --> 13:33.500
the beautiful, shiny baby,

13:33.542 --> 13:34.772
but it looks like

13:34.773 --> 13:36.000
you're playing

13:33.542 --> 13:36.000
tug-of-war with Luke.

13:36.918 --> 13:39.042
I need my mask! Ready?

13:39.083 --> 13:41.042
No!

13:41.083 --> 13:43.355
On three, Mrs. Kipling!

13:43.356 --> 13:45.626
One... Two... Three!

13:46.959 --> 13:48.792
Ah, what a relief!

(BOTH SHUDDER)

13:53.000 --> 13:54.375

13:56.083 --> 13:57.964
- Do I have some of that goop
- left on my face?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.793
Actually, it's what you don't

13:59.794 --> 14:01.584
have on your face.

14:01.626 --> 14:02.792
I don't get it.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.250
I will give you two hints.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:17.709 --> 14:19.375
You destroyed my face!

14:19.417 --> 14:20.480
So now I'm going

14:20.481 --> 14:21.542
to destroy your project,

14:21.584 --> 14:22.918
which is also my face!

14:24.250 --> 14:25.959
- I did not think
- he was this angry.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.147
Well, without the eyebrows,

14:27.148 --> 14:28.292
it was hard to tell.

14:34.417 --> 14:35.793
Luke, please do not

14:35.794 --> 14:37.167
break the mask.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.522
If I do not turn it in, I will

14:39.523 --> 14:41.834
lose my perfect,

14:37.209 --> 14:41.834
4.0 grade point average.

14:41.876 --> 14:43.792
- Ravi, you're getting
- an A in P.E.?

14:43.834 --> 14:45.667
P.E. does not count.

14:45.668 --> 14:47.500
It stands

14:43.834 --> 14:47.500
for "Pointless Exercise."

14:50.000 --> 14:51.668
Okay, Luke. What is it going

14:51.669 --> 14:53.334
to take to get you

14:50.000 --> 14:53.334
to hand over that mask?

14:53.375 --> 14:54.667
We only have...

14:54.709 --> 14:56.250
- Ten minutes
- until the bus comes.

14:56.292 --> 14:57.876
He's not getting his face back

14:57.877 --> 14:59.459
until I get the rest of mine.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.751
Way ahead of you.

15:00.752 --> 15:02.000
I already called in an expert.

15:03.667 --> 15:04.793
Okay, what's the make-up

15:04.794 --> 15:05.918
emergency?

15:05.959 --> 15:08.751
Whatever it is, I can fix it.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.459
The first step

15:10.460 --> 15:12.125
is admitting you have

15:08.792 --> 15:12.125
a problem.

15:12.167 --> 15:13.522
My problem is that

15:13.523 --> 15:14.876
I'm going to be unemployed

- if you guys don't stop
- goofing around.

- Smile.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.042
Jessie!

15:46.083 --> 15:48.000
- Oh, well, someone
- was bound to do it.

15:48.042 --> 15:49.438
Now, hold still

15:49.439 --> 15:50.834
and let her return you

15:48.042 --> 15:50.834
to normal.

15:50.876 --> 15:53.000
Or whatever you were before.

15:54.042 --> 15:55.959
Nice outfit, by the way, Emma.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.293
I'm glad one person is ready

15:57.294 --> 15:58.584
to walk out the door.

15:58.626 --> 16:00.273
Oh, I am so not ready.

16:00.274 --> 16:01.918
This is only option four

15:58.626 --> 16:01.918
out of ten.

16:01.959 --> 16:03.272
I'll be lucky to get to school

16:03.273 --> 16:04.584
before seventh period.

16:04.626 --> 16:05.834
The school day

16:05.835 --> 16:07.042
only has six periods.

16:07.083 --> 16:09.438
I know, but after that

16:09.439 --> 16:11.792
is when I get all my meetings

16:07.083 --> 16:11.792
and trendsetting done.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.626
All I did after school

16:13.627 --> 16:15.417
was play Chinese checkers

16:11.834 --> 16:15.417
with the librarian.

16:15.459 --> 16:17.355
She'd get really mad when

16:17.356 --> 16:19.250
I won. I still have a marble

16:15.459 --> 16:19.250
lodged in my ear.

16:19.292 --> 16:20.292
That sounds horrible!

16:22.083 --> 16:23.167
Hmm?

16:25.417 --> 16:26.417
Hurry up!

16:27.083 --> 16:28.751
Zuri, you'd better be done,

16:28.792 --> 16:30.435
- because I've been dealing
- with missing eyebrows,

16:30.459 --> 16:32.334
- Future babies, and masks
- held hostage.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.459
- So I don't need leaf problems
- on top of that.

16:35.542 --> 16:36.772
I'm finished,

16:36.773 --> 16:38.000
no thanks to you.

16:38.042 --> 16:39.917
I can't believe I had to do

16:39.918 --> 16:41.792
my homework all by myself.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.292
I hope you're happy.

16:44.959 --> 16:46.189
I am happy,

16:46.190 --> 16:47.417
because that's what

16:44.959 --> 16:47.417
you're supposed to do.

16:48.334 --> 16:49.792
What is that?

16:49.834 --> 16:50.939
My project!

16:50.940 --> 16:52.042
I was supposed to gather

16:52.083 --> 16:53.480
30 different leaves,

16:53.481 --> 16:54.876
and these are all different.

16:54.918 --> 16:56.480
No, they're all spinach,

16:56.481 --> 16:58.042
painted different colors.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.542
None of which occur

16:59.543 --> 17:01.000
in nature.

17:01.042 --> 17:04.001
Hey, my teacher can't prove

17:04.002 --> 17:06.959
what we do or do not grow

17:01.042 --> 17:06.959
on our private island.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.810
- You may not be the most
- motivated fourth-grader,

17:08.834 --> 17:10.795
- But you're going to make
- one heck of a lawyer.

17:11.959 --> 17:13.876
(LUKE SCREAMING)

17:13.917 --> 17:15.355
Oh, no!

17:15.356 --> 17:16.791
Please don't let anymore

17:13.917 --> 17:16.791
of his face be missing.

17:18.834 --> 17:20.709
What is it? What's wrong?

17:22.626 --> 17:24.834
Look what she did to me!

17:26.083 --> 17:27.563
Yeah, okay. I should have seen

17:27.564 --> 17:29.042
that coming.

17:29.083 --> 17:30.501
Does he not look good,

17:30.502 --> 17:31.918
Jessie?

17:29.083 --> 17:31.918
Tell him he looks good.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.834
- I don't know
- why he's so cranky.

17:34.876 --> 17:35.918
These would cost him

17:35.919 --> 17:36.959
200 bucks downtown.

17:37.918 --> 17:39.334
That's it!

17:40.083 --> 17:42.417
I'm not going to school,

17:42.459 --> 17:43.730
and neither

17:43.731 --> 17:45.000
is this stupid mask.

17:45.042 --> 17:46.834
Luke, don't! No, stop.

17:46.876 --> 17:48.272
I know this seems like

17:48.273 --> 17:49.667
the end of the world.

17:49.709 --> 17:51.063
At school, everyone judges you

17:51.064 --> 17:52.417
by how you look.

17:52.459 --> 17:54.959
But someday you'll realize

17:55.000 --> 17:56.522
that what's outside

17:56.523 --> 17:58.042
isn't so important.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.876
- It's what's on the inside
- that matters.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.500
Are you out of your mind?

18:03.626 --> 18:06.542
I have girl eyebrows!

18:06.584 --> 18:08.042
I'll get destroyed at school.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.792
On the bright side,

18:09.793 --> 18:11.500
the swirly you will

18:08.083 --> 18:11.500
undoubtedly receive,

18:11.542 --> 18:13.000
will rinse them right off.

18:14.083 --> 18:15.209
Luke, give back the mask.

18:15.210 --> 18:16.334
You're late.

18:16.375 --> 18:17.375
Tough.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.042
That's it!

18:20.083 --> 18:21.792
I am sick and tired of this.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.042
- I promised Christina
- you'd be on time for school,

18:24.083 --> 18:25.855
But every morning

18:25.856 --> 18:27.626
it's the same stupid battle.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.709
You're old enough to get up,

18:29.751 --> 18:31.471
- pick out your clothes,
- do your homework,

18:31.500 --> 18:32.935
- And not rip off
- your brother's eyebrows

18:32.959 --> 18:34.147
Without me having to

18:34.148 --> 18:35.334
yell at you! Am I clear?

18:35.375 --> 18:36.876
Yes.

18:36.918 --> 18:38.939
Sorry.

18:38.940 --> 18:40.959
By the way,

18:36.918 --> 18:40.959
you yelled just a tad.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.022
I did not! I promised

18:42.023 --> 18:43.042
myself I wouldn't yell!

18:43.083 --> 18:45.417
Okay, now I hear it!

18:46.083 --> 18:47.959
So did New Jersey.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.751
Luke,

18:50.752 --> 18:52.000
give Ravi that mask.

18:53.083 --> 18:55.709
Okay. Here, Ravi.

18:55.751 --> 18:56.751
Catch.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.918
No! Ravi can't catch!

19:12.042 --> 19:14.042
Huzzah!

19:14.083 --> 19:16.042
- Luke, perhaps you will
- take comfort

19:16.083 --> 19:18.001
That some small part of you

19:18.002 --> 19:19.918
will finally receive an A.

19:19.959 --> 19:20.959
Yes!

19:22.876 --> 19:24.000
No!

19:27.584 --> 19:29.292
Suddenly, my leaf project

19:29.293 --> 19:31.000
is looking a whole lot better.

19:32.918 --> 19:33.959
Go, go, go.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.000
Come on.

19:35.042 --> 19:36.397
Okay, all right.

19:36.398 --> 19:37.751
Elevator, people!

19:37.792 --> 19:39.542
- The bus will be here
- any second.

19:39.584 --> 19:40.814
Emma, I hope you and Blake

19:40.815 --> 19:42.042
enjoy the carnival.

19:42.083 --> 19:43.563
Actually, I'm going to say yes

19:43.564 --> 19:45.042
to Michael.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.918
Really? How come?

19:46.959 --> 19:48.894
- It was what you said about - the outside
- Not being so important,

19:48.918 --> 19:50.022
And that what really counts

19:50.023 --> 19:51.125
is on the inside.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.522
You mean my speech

19:52.523 --> 19:53.876
to Luke worked on you?

19:54.709 --> 19:56.167
Aw, that is so great.

19:56.209 --> 19:57.397
I really needed

19:57.398 --> 19:58.584
a nanny-win today.

19:59.876 --> 20:00.938
Oh, maybe if I tell you

20:00.939 --> 20:02.000
to shower,

19:59.876 --> 20:02.000
Luke will do it.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.501
(ALL LAUGHING)

20:04.502 --> 20:05.918
That's funny.

20:05.959 --> 20:07.083
(BEEPING)

20:07.125 --> 20:08.293
What? Michael says

20:08.294 --> 20:09.459
I was taking too long,

20:09.500 --> 20:11.834
so he asked out Maybelle.

20:11.876 --> 20:14.143
- I guess I'll just have - to go out
with the super-hunk, - Instead.

20:14.167 --> 20:15.605
Why does everything

20:15.606 --> 20:17.042
happen to me?

20:17.083 --> 20:18.647
You'll get through this,

20:18.648 --> 20:20.209
you're a survivor.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.147
Hey, look!

20:22.148 --> 20:24.042
I fixed my eyebrows!

20:24.083 --> 20:25.897
I borrowed Zuri's marker.

20:25.898 --> 20:27.709
These ought to ward off

20:24.083 --> 20:27.709
the wedgies.

20:27.751 --> 20:29.417
Perhaps I should draw on a

20:29.418 --> 20:31.083
pair of those bad boys.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.918
You can't pull that off.

20:33.959 --> 20:35.480
I just got a confirmation!

20:35.481 --> 20:37.000
They're sending up the food

20:33.959 --> 20:37.000
I ordered!

20:37.042 --> 20:38.542
- (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
- Oh.

20:43.918 --> 20:46.001
Whoa! And I thought

20:46.002 --> 20:48.083
I had an online

20:43.918 --> 20:48.083
shopping problem.

20:48.125 --> 20:50.084
I guess I really did submit

20:50.085 --> 20:52.042
the order 30 times.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.792
- No time to unload
- all this stuff,

20:53.834 --> 20:55.059
- But if anyone's
- still hungry...

20:55.083 --> 20:56.563
We have instant oatmeal

20:56.564 --> 20:58.042
and some bottled water.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.976
- You can mix it in your mouth
- on the way down.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.042
Okay!

21:01.043 --> 21:02.083
Have a nice day!

21:02.125 --> 21:04.000
Send the groceries back up!

21:04.042 --> 21:05.959
- And Luke's going to school
- in his pajamas.

21:08.709 --> 21:10.042
(BOTH SIGHING)

21:10.083 --> 21:12.584
I am completely exhausted.

21:12.626 --> 21:14.834
- And that wasn't even the worst
- morning this week.

21:14.876 --> 21:16.898
At least we have seven hours

21:16.899 --> 21:18.918
of peace and quiet

21:14.876 --> 21:18.918
before they get back.

21:19.918 --> 21:21.042
(BOTH MOAN)

21:21.083 --> 21:22.042
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

21:22.083 --> 21:24.042
We're back!

21:24.083 --> 21:26.042
(SCREAMING)

21:26.083 --> 21:27.876
How did you get expelled

21:27.877 --> 21:29.667
already? You just left!

21:31.042 --> 21:32.101
We just got text reminders.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.000
- All of our classes
- are canceled!

21:34.042 --> 21:36.000
- It is parent-teacher
- conference day!

21:36.042 --> 21:37.310
- Why didn't they
- tell you that sooner?

21:37.334 --> 21:39.167
They did! We just forgot.

21:42.042 --> 21:43.959
Hey, hey. Stop frolicking

21:43.960 --> 21:45.876
on my fontina!

21:45.918 --> 21:47.980
Better hurry, Jessie,

21:47.981 --> 21:50.042
our teachers do not like

21:45.918 --> 21:50.042
to be kept waiting.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.459
Wait. You mean...

21:51.460 --> 21:52.834
I have to go to school today?

21:52.876 --> 21:53.959
Tick tock!

21:54.042 --> 21:54.792
You're late!

21:54.834 --> 21:55.939
Guess that outfit

21:55.940 --> 21:57.042
will have to do!

21:57.083 --> 21:59.042
But I never got breakfast!

21:59.083 --> 22:00.480
Well, you should have

22:00.481 --> 22:01.876
woken up earlier.

22:01.918 --> 22:04.042
- Every day,
- it's the same thing with her.

22:06.751 --> 22:08.751
I'm not going to yell.

22:08.792 --> 22:10.000
I'm not going to yell.
