00:02.500 --> 00:04.000
JEN:
I'm always up for a good party.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.834
Why don't we pick it up
from "God's promise
and warning"?

00:07.834 --> 00:09.875
Pacey, uh, you got a...

00:09.875 --> 00:13.166
I got an "A".
I got an "A", Andie,

00:13.166 --> 00:15.625
and I'm falling hopelessly
in love with you, Andie.

00:15.625 --> 00:18.458
You were with Jack,
you moved on, and you let go.

00:18.458 --> 00:21.458
So now I, in turn,
am letting you go.

00:21.458 --> 00:23.834
Dawson, is clearly over me.
I promise.

00:23.834 --> 00:26.458
Just as long as you're over him,
nothing else matters.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.667
PACEY: I can't believe
you made this whole thing
by yourself.

00:36.667 --> 00:37.834
Congratulations, Jack.

00:37.834 --> 00:39.417
Thanks.
I'm not completely done, though.

00:39.417 --> 00:42.208
I mean, I still have this
whole back section to paint.

00:42.208 --> 00:46.542
So I'm truly impressed
and-- and grateful.

00:46.917 --> 00:49.291
I'm still a little unclear
though as to
why you wanted this.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.375
You're not going to
blow it up or anything, are ya?

00:51.375 --> 00:54.125
No. No. There's
no asteroid in my movie.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.583
It's for aerial shots,
establishing.

00:55.583 --> 00:56.959
Just get the right lens
and the right light,

00:56.959 --> 01:00.041
and you've got the perfect,
quaint Creekside village.

01:00.041 --> 01:02.083
It's amazing what a little
camera trickery can do.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.667
Well,
if you guys will excuse me,

01:03.667 --> 01:06.375
I have a ton of homework
to do, including
Peterson's assignment,

01:06.375 --> 01:08.125
which I haven't
even started yet.

01:08.125 --> 01:09.250
Yeah. I haven't either.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.875
Pacey Witter is leaving
early to do homework.

01:11.875 --> 01:15.667
Ha! It's slightly
less believable than
an Enquirer  headline.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.458
Oh, yeah.
It's a disgusting habit.

01:17.458 --> 01:19.041
Ha!

01:19.041 --> 01:21.375
All right. Well, thanks,
guys, I'll see you later.

01:21.375 --> 01:22.375
No. I can stay.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.708
But I'm just gonna
do a test shot.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.375
No. It's ok. I'd like to see it.
It's all right.

01:26.375 --> 01:28.625
Ok. Cool.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.708
Well, ta-ta, gents.

01:35.500 --> 01:38.041
Don't stay up too late,
you know? It is a school night.

01:41.166 --> 01:44.792
your sister has had quite
a profound influence on him.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.291
Yeah, well,
relationships will do that.

01:47.875 --> 01:48.917
Yeah.

01:52.417 --> 01:57.458
Sorry. I didn't mean that
the way that came out.

02:00.333 --> 02:01.792
Look, Jack--

02:01.792 --> 02:05.166
This hasn't exactly been
the easiest situation
for either of us,

02:05.166 --> 02:07.667
but your help
on this film has been
so significant,

02:07.667 --> 02:11.333
- I just...
- JACK: So we're cool?

02:11.333 --> 02:12.125
Yeah.

02:12.834 --> 02:14.708
So what's this Peterson
assignment about?

02:14.708 --> 02:15.792
Ah, a poem.

02:16.208 --> 02:18.000
He wants us to write
about something that's
critical to our being.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.792
Whatever. It's just
another assignment
I'm gonna screw up.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.417
It's a poem.
It can't be that hard.

02:24.291 --> 02:27.125
I read your script.
You're the expert writer here.

02:27.583 --> 02:29.834
Any advice as to how
to get to the good stuff?

02:29.834 --> 02:33.708
Um... Listen to yourself.

02:34.208 --> 02:35.667
Writing's about
opening up, you know?

02:35.959 --> 02:38.834
It's a chance to offer the world
a peek at that very private
part of yourself

02:38.834 --> 02:43.125
-that you otherwise just stifle.
-JACK: So just listen to myself?

02:43.125 --> 02:44.500
Yeah. I mean...

02:45.166 --> 02:46.750
You never know
what you'll hear.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.500
Could you do me a favor
and hit the lights?

02:49.500 --> 02:50.500
Oh, yeah.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.583

MR. MILO: Pacey!

04:03.333 --> 04:05.542
Mr. Milo. Now,
before you say anything,

04:05.542 --> 04:08.041
I want you to know
I have the situation
under complete control.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.792
And what situation is that?

04:10.542 --> 04:12.750
Well, whichever of my
academic improprieties

04:12.750 --> 04:14.291
you were about
to make me aware of.

04:14.291 --> 04:16.708
"Improprieties"
is the wrong word.

04:16.708 --> 04:18.041
Try "kudos."

04:18.666 --> 04:21.041
I just received
the midterm reports

04:21.041 --> 04:23.250
for all of the students
on academic watch,

04:23.667 --> 04:28.000
and after removing
my jaw from the floor,
I came to see you.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.792
You posted three Bs, two As.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.375
What? That's impossible.

04:33.375 --> 04:34.917
One would think so.

04:36.792 --> 04:40.250
You know, I don't think
I've ever seen you
smile before, Mr. Milo.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.208
I'm liking this.

04:41.208 --> 04:42.291
The smiling thing,
I definitely like.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.750

keep up the good work,

- Just because.

05:03.875 --> 05:05.000
Uh, don't even.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.125
What? We can't
have a "just because"?

05:07.125 --> 05:10.125
Sure. In private,
but massive suck-face embraces

05:10.125 --> 05:12.500

No offense.

Hey, guys.

05:17.458 --> 05:19.125
Jack, I was just wondering,
when do you think

05:19.125 --> 05:21.583
we can get started on the set
for the pageant scene?

05:21.583 --> 05:22.834
This weekend, if you want.

05:22.834 --> 05:25.458
Ok, great. I'll schedule

So...
That was nice.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.250
What was nice?

05:46.250 --> 05:48.250
You and Jack
actually conversing.

05:48.834 --> 05:50.000
It was a surprise.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.500
Some people are capable
of moving beyond their

05:52.500 --> 05:55.250
petty longtime rivalries
to a higher ground.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.667
Yeah, right.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.750
If Jack wasn't doing
your movie, Dawson,

05:58.750 --> 06:00.417
he'd still be the enemy.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.125
Not true.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.041
You are so Hollywood.

Hey, Ty.

06:19.917 --> 06:20.875
Well, as far as I know,

06:21.375 --> 06:23.875
there have been
three phone messages to you
in this last week.

06:23.875 --> 06:26.708
Adorable phone messages
with my number included.

06:27.083 --> 06:30.166
So I was just wondering
why you haven't
returned any of them.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.750
You're on my
to-call list, Ty.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.542

06:36.125 --> 06:37.708

not to toot my own horn,

06:37.708 --> 06:40.250
but I could swear you
were into me that night
that we went out.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.458
Not to toot your
own horn or anything.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.333
It was the party, wasn't it?

06:47.417 --> 06:49.708
All that Bible-speak,
it freaked you out.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.625
Honestly? Yeah, it did.

06:53.959 --> 06:57.458
Jen, that's not all
that I am, all right?

06:57.458 --> 07:02.041
For your information,
I'm not some Bible-banging
dorkus mcforkus here.

07:02.917 --> 07:05.959
Ok, I'm sure
that you're not, Ty. It's just--

07:07.208 --> 07:09.625
Uh, ok,
obviously your religion

07:09.625 --> 07:11.792
is something that's
very important to you.

07:12.417 --> 07:15.542
I just see it as
an inevitable obstacle
in our relationship.

07:15.542 --> 07:17.583
Don't you think
that we should go out
on our first date

07:17.583 --> 07:19.583
before you map out
our entire future?

07:19.583 --> 07:22.125
Ty, you're sweet.
And you're funny.

07:23.083 --> 07:25.291
But you go to
these bible meetings
three times a week,

07:25.291 --> 07:27.417
and that's probably
how many times
I've been to church

07:27.417 --> 07:28.417
in the past ten years,

07:28.875 --> 07:32.500
so hopefully you
can understand why that
would present a problem

07:32.500 --> 07:35.750
with us being anything
more than just friends,
all right?

07:36.125 --> 07:39.542
See? That just goes to show
how little you know me.

07:40.959 --> 07:46.000
See? I'm not funny at all.
Look, I'm not giving up.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.250
Now, that's a shame.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.959
You know, I thought most women
admired persistence.

07:49.959 --> 07:52.542
Well, that just goes to show
how little you know about me.

07:52.542 --> 07:53.834
I'm not most women.

08:07.792 --> 08:11.250
Mr. Witter,
empty-handed, I presume?

08:11.250 --> 08:13.500
No. It was in here.
I mean, I had it at the locker.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.542
I just-- I must've...
left it right here in my binder.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.375

08:23.375 --> 08:25.500
Yeah. Trust me.
They're more exciting
than Grecian urns.

with cursive for the
first time, Mr. Witter?

08:29.834 --> 08:31.333
Listen, I worked hard on that.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.332
I'm sure.

08:32.332 --> 08:35.125
However, you
neglected penmanship,

08:35.125 --> 08:38.417
and presentation
is half the grade,

08:38.417 --> 08:41.917
so, as I see it,
you have two choices:

08:41.917 --> 08:44.875
you can bring
the poem in tomorrow,
written legibly

08:44.875 --> 08:47.500
and lose points
for handing it in late,

08:47.500 --> 08:52.166
or you can hand it in as it is,
and the highest grade you'll see

08:52.166 --> 08:54.792
will be your old friend,
the letter "D".

08:57.333 --> 09:00.917

- Fairness is overrated.

get meaner every day?

Uh, nothing.

assignment went well,

- Sure. Yeah. It, um, went fine.
- Good!

like to read your poem
for the class.

were just for you.

is of no importance to me.

Here's the best part...

12:55.208 --> 12:59.959
The poem, it's about a guy.
McPhee's a total homo.

- Sure.

Have you talked to Jack yet?

Oh, we haven't really
talked about it yet. No.

He's still pretty upset
about it.

13:31.291 --> 13:33.250
Yeah, I can imagine.

Rumor mill's working overtime
on this one.

I've heard about the incident
twice more.

You've heard about it?
I've heard everything

regularly wearing dresses

into a monastery to deal
with his sexual ambivalence.

You're being pretty flip
about this.

Well, why not, Dawson?
I mean, it's all a big joke.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000

trying to do, Dawson,

14:02.500 --> 14:05.625
give validity to
some ridiculous rumor
that Jack's gay?

14:05.625 --> 14:08.083
- No. Joey, I never said that.
- You pretty much did.

14:08.083 --> 14:10.125
All I'm trying to do is find out
what's going on.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.875
I would hope that
you know me well enough

14:11.875 --> 14:13.333
to know that my concern
is genuine.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.166
There's no need to be
so defensive about this.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.125
I'm not being defensive,
Dawson.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.500
Why don't we just say
what this conversation
is really about?

14:19.500 --> 14:22.583
Your passive aggressive way
of highlighting some flaw
in Jack

14:22.583 --> 14:24.166
that would get us to break up.

14:24.166 --> 14:25.542
That's way over the line.

14:25.542 --> 14:27.291
No, it's not.
From where I'm standing,

14:27.291 --> 14:29.000

it's perfectly in bounds.

why he had to write
that poem to begin with.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.041
I mean, if he hadn't
written something

15:08.041 --> 15:10.250
that could have been so easily
misinterpreted, then--

15:10.250 --> 15:11.834

censored himself?

than to expose himself

I don't think guest starring in

37:57.041 --> 38:00.083
I can't, and I never will.
Not after what you did.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.542
You have a good afternoon.

38:35.041 --> 38:36.333
How'd it go?

38:39.959 --> 38:41.542
As well as could be
imagined.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.166
They suspended me
for a week.

38:48.166 --> 38:50.333
Why'd you bother
coming down here?

38:51.458 --> 38:53.291
Because I care about you.

38:55.041 --> 38:58.333
- Do you?
- What kind of question is that?

38:58.959 --> 39:00.875
It's a reasonable one, Andie.

39:02.291 --> 39:04.875
Do you have any idea
what I went through today?

39:05.333 --> 39:07.125
How much I needed
your support?

39:08.542 --> 39:12.250
Pacey, I can't support
everything you do. I never will.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.333
I don't want you to agree
with every decision I ever make.

39:14.333 --> 39:16.291
The world would be
a boring place if you did,

39:16.291 --> 39:20.166
but what I am asking for
is to know that some way,

39:20.166 --> 39:21.917
somehow,
you're there for me.

39:23.083 --> 39:28.041
How dare you?
I challenge one action of yours,

39:28.041 --> 39:30.500
and you throw it in my face
like it's some sort of weakness?

39:30.500 --> 39:32.875
It's not just me.
You weren't there
for your brother Jack, either.

39:32.875 --> 39:35.083
Oh, yes, I was.
I apologized to him,

39:35.083 --> 39:36.708
and I came to apologize
to you, too,

39:36.708 --> 39:41.542
but for some reason
I was struggling with it
all the way down here.

39:41.542 --> 39:44.458
That reason has suddenly
become crystal clear.

39:44.458 --> 39:46.458
Jack is innocent, Pacey.

39:46.458 --> 39:50.458
What's happening to him
right now he has no control
over, but you--

39:50.458 --> 39:52.250
you knew what you were
doing in that classroom.

39:52.250 --> 39:53.375
What would you have me do,

39:53.375 --> 39:55.208
just stand there
and let Peterson do that to him

39:55.208 --> 39:57.208
- when I knew the whole time...
- There are other ways--

39:57.208 --> 40:01.083
that it was my fault, Andie?
It was my fault!

40:02.667 --> 40:05.208
Peterson knew that he couldn't
get the best of me,

40:05.208 --> 40:07.041
so he went after your brother.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.291
If I hadn't instigated him
that day...

40:11.959 --> 40:13.625
None of this would've ever
happened.

40:16.542 --> 40:18.542
That's why I had to stop it.

40:18.542 --> 40:21.542
However I could, I just--I had
to stop it.

40:22.333 --> 40:25.333
Why didn't you tell me
that you felt responsible?

40:27.083 --> 40:28.583
Because, Andie...

40:30.625 --> 40:32.417
You didn't want to
hear about it.

40:33.250 --> 40:35.500
You just wanted me
to clean up the mess.

40:37.417 --> 40:39.917
And there are some messes
you just have to live with.

40:44.750 --> 40:46.291
I'm gonna go home now.

40:53.875 --> 40:55.583
Do you want me to come with you?

40:57.917 --> 41:01.041
No. Not tonight.

41:16.750 --> 41:17.750
Hey, Jack.

41:18.250 --> 41:20.458
Hey, where you been?
I've been covering both shifts.

41:22.166 --> 41:25.834
- Are you gay?
- Excuse me?

41:28.375 --> 41:31.792
Are you gay?
I mean, you don't have
to answer right away.

41:31.792 --> 41:32.959
I just had to ask right away

41:33.250 --> 41:35.458
because it's been
building up in me
and there's no easy way

41:35.458 --> 41:37.792
for a girl to ask her boyfriend
if he's gay than to just ask.

41:37.792 --> 41:40.166
I know you already told me
that the poem wasn't about a guy

41:40.166 --> 41:42.041
but I feel like
when we discussed it,

41:42.041 --> 41:44.834
we never really discussed it,
and I never really asked.

41:44.834 --> 41:46.542
Feel free to answer
any minute now--

41:46.542 --> 41:50.750
No. No. I'm not gay.

41:54.625 --> 41:56.166
Ok. Uh...

41:57.000 --> 41:59.208
You don't know
what a relief that is.

42:00.083 --> 42:01.333
I mean, not that I care,

42:01.333 --> 42:03.667
I would've dealt with it fine,
I promise. It's just...

42:04.250 --> 42:06.667
Who wants to deal
with all the obvious and
not so obvious issues

42:06.667 --> 42:11.542
of a girl who's dating a guy
who turns out to be gay?
And it's just so hard, and...

42:34.041 --> 42:35.458
Hey. Feel better now?

42:37.917 --> 42:39.458
You know, even though...

42:47.166 --> 42:50.583
- Could you do me a favor?
- Yeah, what?

42:52.959 --> 42:58.083
No more poems.
Just for a little while.

42:59.500 --> 43:00.750
You got it.

43:02.834 --> 43:04.041
No more poems.

43:27.250 --> 43:33.208
- I'm not gay, Joey. Ok?
- Yeah.

43:59.041 --> 44:01.166
