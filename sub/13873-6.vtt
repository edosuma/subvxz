WEBVTT

00:06.639 --> 00:08.266
Spacecataz.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.173
I'm sorry.
You have the wrong number.

00:10.210 --> 00:12.735
Damn it!
Why did you hang up on me?

00:12.779 --> 00:14.041
Hit redial!

00:15.115 --> 00:18.551
- Hello?
- Hello. This is Mr. Brown.

00:18.585 --> 00:20.416
I... I believe
that we got this...

00:20.453 --> 00:22.387
I'm sorry.
You have the wrong number.

00:22.422 --> 00:23.719
Oh, damn it!

00:23.757 --> 00:27.386
My name is Shake-Zula

00:27.427 --> 00:29.486
The mike ruler,
the old schooler

00:29.529 --> 00:31.690
You want to trip?
I'll bring it to ya

00:31.731 --> 00:34.928
Frylock and I'm on top,
rock you like a cop

00:34.968 --> 00:37.562
Meatwad, you're up next
with your knock-knock

00:37.604 --> 00:39.970
Meatwad make the money, see?

00:40.006 --> 00:42.440
Meatwad get the honeys, G

00:42.475 --> 00:45.035
Driving in my car,
living like a star

00:45.078 --> 00:47.012
Ice on my fingers
and my toes

00:47.047 --> 00:48.514
And I'm a Taurus

00:48.548 --> 00:50.948
Uh, check-check it, yeah

00:50.984 --> 00:52.975
'cause we are
the Aqua Teens

00:53.019 --> 00:54.680
Make the homeys say ho

00:54.721 --> 00:56.621
And the girlies
want to scream

00:56.656 --> 00:58.521
'Cause we are
the Aqua Teens

00:58.558 --> 01:00.150
Make the homeys say ho

01:00.193 --> 01:02.024
And the girlies
want to scream

01:02.062 --> 01:03.927
Aqua Teen Hunger Force

01:03.963 --> 01:06.193
Number one
in the hood, G

01:06.232 --> 01:07.859
Please come visit me, dawg

01:07.901 --> 01:09.869
Well, back in 1912,
I could kick your ass

01:09.903 --> 01:11.427
I did the tango
and the fox trot

01:11.471 --> 01:13.098
Before it got banned

01:13.139 --> 01:15.130
There was ragtime and jazz
before there ever was rap

01:15.175 --> 01:17.439
Now I'm trapped with
a colostomy bag in my pants...

01:17.477 --> 01:19.342
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

01:19.379 --> 01:20.437
- Oh, hell, no.
- Hell, yeah.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.572
We are not doing this again.
No way.

01:21.614 --> 01:22.808
Yeah way.

01:22.849 --> 01:24.749
This is MC Pee Pants, isn't it?
Isn't it?

01:24.784 --> 01:25.808
- No.
- OK. Fine.

01:25.852 --> 01:27.342
- Sir Loin, right?
- No.

01:27.387 --> 01:28.752
OK. Well, who is it, then?

01:28.788 --> 01:30.756
Guess.

01:31.858 --> 01:33.189
Where are my eyes looking?

01:33.226 --> 01:34.659
Will you just tell me who he is?

01:34.694 --> 01:36.127
'Cause I'm not gonna look
at your poster.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.993
This here is Little Brittle
and the C-Bag...

01:38.031 --> 01:40.329
and he's kicking it...
elderly school.

01:40.366 --> 01:41.458
- See?
- Yeah, I see him.

01:41.501 --> 01:42.900
- See?
- Yeah, I see him, OK?

01:42.936 --> 01:45.530
And this is MC Pee Pants.
He's come back again.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.972
I mean, look at the shower cap.
Look at the yellow eyes.

01:48.007 --> 01:49.406
Look at the diaper.
It's the same guy.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.637
No. He's incompetent
at being continent.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.475
He raps about that
on side two.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.572
Bowel trouble, y'all,
stool settle

01:55.615 --> 01:57.480
Soft and loose,
soft and loose

01:57.517 --> 01:59.508
You got to give me the juice,
the Metamuce

01:59.552 --> 02:00.610
All right, all right.
Whatever.

02:00.653 --> 02:01.881
And that goes on forever.

02:01.921 --> 02:03.650
All right, all right. Fine.
What kind of crazy...

02:03.690 --> 02:05.624
dumb-ass,
world-dominating plan...

02:05.658 --> 02:07.649
does he have hidden
in his lyrics this time, huh?

02:07.694 --> 02:10.253
No, man. Nothing.
Just listen to this.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.526
So I got liver spots
bigger than dalmatian dots

02:12.565 --> 02:13.862
I'm all alone

02:13.900 --> 02:15.834
Won't you please
come visit me, dawg?

02:15.869 --> 02:18.633
He just wants friends.
He's old and lonely...

02:18.671 --> 02:20.070
and he got a stone-cold groove.

02:20.106 --> 02:21.801
Oh, really? Well,
we'll just see about that.

02:21.841 --> 02:24.071
Where's he located?
612 Wharf Avenue, right?

02:24.110 --> 02:26.271
No. His son moved him
to Tragic Castles...

02:26.312 --> 02:28.872
'cause he's driving a wedge
in their marriage...

02:28.915 --> 02:32.180
pooping and wandering off
and messing up the shower.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.617
Damn. They put him up there?

02:33.653 --> 02:35.712
Yeah, and they don't
never visit him, neither.

02:35.755 --> 02:38.121
And he needs to be resituated
every three hours.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.126
He gets sores.
That's why he says in his song...

02:40.160 --> 02:42.492
Roll me, homey,
my hips aren't burly

02:42.529 --> 02:45.396
I'm getting sores,
and I'm getting lonely

02:45.431 --> 02:48.366
That rhyme ain't too good,
but the beat is awesome.

02:48.401 --> 02:51.370
Yeah, but they do... I mean,
they have nurses, don't they?

02:51.404 --> 02:53.133
Yeah, but they don't
go in there no more...

02:53.173 --> 02:55.971
because he spits on them
and calls them harlots...

02:56.009 --> 02:58.443
and barks at them
to... to get nude.

02:58.478 --> 02:59.706
Oh, man.

02:59.746 --> 03:01.611
I hope we never end up
like that, huh, meatwad?

03:01.648 --> 03:04.014
I won't. You will.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.280
I gots to go and give respect.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.719
Yeah. I think I'll go, too...

03:08.755 --> 03:10.586
because something's
got to be up with this.

03:10.623 --> 03:12.989
Where do you two
think you're going?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.256
- Wherever the hell we want.
- Not without me!

03:15.295 --> 03:16.455
We're going to see
Little Brittle...

03:16.496 --> 03:17.622
at the old folks' home.

03:17.664 --> 03:18.961
Go. Without me.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.056
Ah, come on, Shake.

03:20.099 --> 03:21.794
You could probably cheer up
some old folks.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.029
Well, can we at least
make a side trip?

03:24.070 --> 03:25.469
To where?

03:25.505 --> 03:27.132
Peru. That's near here, right?

03:27.173 --> 03:28.401
See ya.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.272
Yeah. See this.

03:30.310 --> 03:33.575
Dracula called, and...
he's coming tonight.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.112
Little Brittle, knock knock.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.914
Hey, Little Brittle.
We've come to visit you.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.443
Big bitch,
get away from my socks!

03:41.487 --> 03:45.321
I'll stab you in the neck with
this picture of my grandson!

03:45.358 --> 03:46.655
Easy, easy now, Little B.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.160
We're just here to visit, man.
That's all.

03:48.194 --> 03:49.786
Yeah. We're just here to hang.

03:49.829 --> 03:54.857
Hey! Oh, yeah.
Uh, come on in, my sneedo.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.029
Come on over here and give
Little Brittle some props.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.768
I haven't been touched
in a long time.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.173
Whoa! Ooh.

04:03.209 --> 04:04.733
Go on, Meatwad.
He's happy to see you.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.335
He wants you to hug him, see?

04:06.379 --> 04:07.937
But I... I don't want to.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.712
Aw, homey. Why do you got to
play me like that?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.275
Give him a hug, Meatwad.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.879
But he smells like lotion
and doo-doo.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.219
Come here! Ah!

04:17.257 --> 04:19.623
Hey, you shot up like a weed.

04:19.659 --> 04:21.422
You're, like, man-sized now.

04:21.461 --> 04:26.592
Shake my hand like a man.
I'm hugging a man, y'all!

04:26.633 --> 04:29.101
What brings y'all down
to the assisted-living hizzy?

04:29.135 --> 04:30.568
Uh, it's funny you should ask...

04:30.603 --> 04:32.036
'cause, uh,
that's what I'm wondering.

04:32.071 --> 04:33.538
What do you have
up your sleeve this time?

04:33.573 --> 04:37.475
Oh, no! Oh, no, you did not!
No one asked me that...

04:37.510 --> 04:39.637
when I was fighting for
your freedom in WWll.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.874
- Look, OK. I'm sorry, all right?
- I'm a veteran!

04:41.914 --> 04:45.008
I just remember the last few
times we had run-ins with you.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.848
Do I know y'all?

04:46.886 --> 04:48.911
I'm Frylock,
and this is Meatwad.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.048
Nice to meet you...
for the third time.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.251
Oh, yeah. You are the...

04:53.293 --> 04:55.784
yeah, you the... you...
you the guy that...

04:55.828 --> 04:57.489
wait a minute.
Who the... are you?

04:57.530 --> 04:59.862
What are you doing in my room?

04:59.899 --> 05:01.264
You don't remember meeting us?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.792
OK. A couple of years ago,
you were a 6-foot-tall spider...

05:03.836 --> 05:06.464
that wanted us to help you
drill a hole into the earth...

05:06.506 --> 05:09.634
to unleash demons to run your
global diet pill pyramid scheme.

05:09.676 --> 05:10.938
The what?

05:10.977 --> 05:13.411
All right. What about this one?
A year later, you were a cow...

05:13.446 --> 05:15.573
that tried to get us to bring
all our garbage to you...

05:15.615 --> 05:18.106
so you could use flies to
evaporate the walls of a bank...

05:18.151 --> 05:19.618
so you could get
the money and... ugh.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.085
Uh...

05:21.120 --> 05:22.781
so you could get the money
to rent patio furniture...

05:22.822 --> 05:24.016
that you hadn't paid for yet.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.958
And this is us at dinner right before
we sent you to the slaughterhouse.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.292
<i>- Remember that?
- Well... those are good ideas.</i>

05:30.330 --> 05:32.355
So, you don't remember
any of this.

05:32.398 --> 05:33.695
- No.
- OK. OK.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.633
Satan has brought you back
as an old man to do something.

05:35.668 --> 05:36.726
Now, what is it?

05:36.769 --> 05:38.999
Boy, you crazy.
Sit down a spell.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.666
You want to get busy
with some hard candy?

05:41.708 --> 05:43.938
- No, thank you.
- Hell, yeah.

05:43.976 --> 05:46.001
I want candy,
bubble gum, and taffy

05:46.045 --> 05:48.980
- Remember that, Little Brittle?
- Nope.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.040
Hey, you, uh,
you gonna put out any more jams?

05:51.084 --> 05:53.211
No, no, man.
My... my label dropped me.

05:53.252 --> 05:55.482
<i>They said that songs
like Uh-ih, Pilii...</i>

05:55.521 --> 05:57.352
didn't connect
with today's youth.

05:57.390 --> 06:01.053
Yeah. Also, you slept through
a lot of them songs, right?

06:02.862 --> 06:04.124
Hello?

06:07.734 --> 06:11.761
- Oh, man. This is sad.
- Yes, it is.

06:11.804 --> 06:13.533
Guess I was wrong
about Little Brittle.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.302
So, we should go...

06:15.341 --> 06:17.673
because it smells like lotion
and doo-doo here.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.678
Hey, hey!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.772
I haven't even shown you
pictures of my grandchildren.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.305
This here is little, uh...

06:24.350 --> 06:25.908
who is this?

06:25.952 --> 06:27.681
Um, we best get going.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.711
No, Meatwad.
You should stay and visit.

06:29.756 --> 06:30.950
Wait a minute. Who are
these people surrounding me?

06:30.990 --> 06:32.014
I think it's important...

06:32.058 --> 06:33.457
Get away from me!
You're trying to kill me!

06:33.493 --> 06:35.393
that I get out of here, though.
Have fun!

06:35.428 --> 06:36.452
Wait, wait! Don't go!

06:36.496 --> 06:38.020
Come on, dawg.
Stay with me, dawg.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.692
Today is applesauce day.
Applesauce day, dawg!

06:40.733 --> 06:42.860
- OK.
- Oh, thank God.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.769
Thank you so much for staying.
Now, look here.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.204
You make sure they don't steal
my wristwatch.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.298
They're in my mind.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.571
But you...
you ain't got a wristwatch.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.305
The wristwatch is in my mind.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.370
I had to hide it there,
you understand?

06:54.414 --> 06:55.745
I'll try to.

06:55.782 --> 06:59.047
Oh, frylock, you would not
believe what just happened.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.814
A prowler broke in here...

07:00.853 --> 07:03.014
and forced your cupcakes
in my mouth...

07:03.055 --> 07:05.285
and now he says
if you don't leave the room...

07:05.324 --> 07:08.316
and let him use the internet,
he'll shoot me.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.022
Fine.

07:10.062 --> 07:11.222
He has a gun, you know.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.233
Well, you said he'd shoot you,
so I did figure it was a gun.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.033
Frylock, I am completely
serious here...

07:19.338 --> 07:20.862
You had more cupcakes?!

07:20.907 --> 07:23.671
You think I could just
leave things I want out by you?

07:23.709 --> 07:26.644
Well, I leave stuff around you,
and I don't cry.

07:26.679 --> 07:29.773
Last Tuesday, you said,
from your own mouth...

07:29.816 --> 07:31.443
that I left a mess...

07:31.484 --> 07:33.679
and that was for you,
and you threw it out.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.710
- Oh, Meatwad.
- Our friendship is over.

07:35.755 --> 07:37.245
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Look, don't forget...

07:37.290 --> 07:38.780
to bring these cupcakes
to Little Brittle, OK?

07:38.825 --> 07:40.486
He don't like cupcakes
too much...

07:40.526 --> 07:42.551
'cause he says
that the government...

07:42.595 --> 07:45.359
made them too hard to chew
intentionally...

07:45.398 --> 07:48.856
and he says that he's too crazy
to go on much longer this way.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.869
You're friends
with an old person?

07:50.903 --> 07:51.927
Yes.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.439
I cut everyone off at forty.
After that, you're dead meat.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.465
- That's why I'm the master.
- Shake.

07:56.509 --> 07:59.342
What? I don't see you lining up
to see old people.

07:59.378 --> 08:01.403
Well, that's only because
they smell awful.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.540
I mean, I would go
if the people were younger...

08:03.583 --> 08:05.517
and didn't reek of fluids.
I mean...

08:05.551 --> 08:06.575
Oh, but I should go.

08:06.619 --> 08:09.417
Meatwad, it's very important
that someone goes.

08:09.455 --> 08:11.480
Someone without a nose.

08:11.524 --> 08:12.889
And that's you, so go ahead.

08:12.925 --> 08:16.520
Oh, OK. Yeah,
that makes sense, I guess.

08:16.562 --> 08:19.087
Frylock,
you don't have a nose, either.

08:19.131 --> 08:20.155
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.326
Because he was the prowler.

08:22.368 --> 08:23.699
Will you shut up?

08:24.770 --> 08:26.601
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Stick that tooth in there.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.368
- Yeah, punch it in.
- You feeling any different?

08:28.407 --> 08:30.170
No. Try the other side.

08:30.209 --> 08:31.403
I ain't getting nothing here.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.173
I got blood somewhere.
Come on! Just put it in there.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.702
Hey, Meatwad,
you forgot these cup...

08:34.746 --> 08:36.009
What the hell's
going on in here?

08:36.048 --> 08:38.744
- I'm turning him into a vampire.
- You're doing what?

08:38.784 --> 08:40.808
Vampire! He's a vampire!
He's turning me into a vampire.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.285
Well, he's not a vampire!

08:42.321 --> 08:43.754
I know. I keep telling him that.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.314
He says...
he says, "Do it anyway".

08:46.359 --> 08:48.224
Yeah, yeah.
Get my teeth out of that glass.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.319
See if they're sharp.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.624
Why would you even think
he's a vampire?

08:50.663 --> 08:52.597
Well, why the hell
do you think I released...

08:52.632 --> 08:55.328
<i>Cime Visit Me, Dawg
in Transylvania, yo?</i>

08:55.368 --> 08:57.859
Yeah, that was an import.
I paid extra for that.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.566
See, I released it
in Transylvania...

09:00.606 --> 09:03.234
so vampires would come
and visit me...

09:03.276 --> 09:05.744
and I could get them
to bite into my neck...

09:05.778 --> 09:07.905
and then I could
become immortal.

09:07.947 --> 09:09.414
Why the hell do you think
I made myself...

09:09.448 --> 09:10.779
look so sexy on the cover?

09:10.816 --> 09:12.511
See, I knew it. I knew
some bull... was up with you.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.610
I knew it.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.314
Look, yo.
Brittle needs to live forever.

09:15.354 --> 09:16.719
Otherwise, I go down to hell...

09:16.756 --> 09:18.986
and Satan will send me back here
as something worse.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.721
He's got all these ideas.
He don't tell me none of them!

09:21.761 --> 09:23.058
Why don't you
just become a Christian?

09:23.095 --> 09:24.790
Yeah. That way,
when you die...

09:24.830 --> 09:27.628
you go to heaven,
away from bad ol' Satan.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.795
Can I do that? I mean,
are they cool with vampires?

09:30.836 --> 09:33.168
'Cause I got to feast on blood.
That's how I roll.

09:33.205 --> 09:35.673
Look, you can't be both.
Either become one or the other.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.699
And the other, which is
a vampire, is impossible.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.973
Well, then I guess
I'm a Christian.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.537
Oh, yeah.
Bringin' in the Cs, y'all.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.040
Who knew I had it in me? I did.
Now kill me. Quick!

09:46.085 --> 09:47.347
We're not gonna kill you.

09:47.386 --> 09:49.115
The moral thing to do
is to let you die naturally...

09:49.155 --> 09:50.986
alone, in a pile
of your own filth.

09:51.023 --> 09:53.150
Look, it's easy.
Just build a time machine...

09:53.192 --> 09:54.989
go back
into prehistoric times...

09:55.027 --> 09:57.018
with a satellite tracking device
and a laser gun...

09:57.063 --> 09:59.258
blow up the comet,
save all the dinosaurs...

09:59.298 --> 10:01.391
so they don't die out
and create fossil fuels...

10:01.434 --> 10:03.163
so there ain't no energy
to feed my food to.

10:03.202 --> 10:05.932
Or we could just pull
this plug right here.

10:05.972 --> 10:07.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Do that!

10:10.710 --> 10:12.109
- Little Brittle.
- No way.

10:12.144 --> 10:13.441
Do... do I know you?

10:13.479 --> 10:16.539
Oh, my gosh.
I so love your record.

10:16.582 --> 10:18.709
Ha ha ha ha!
You're so cool.

10:18.751 --> 10:20.309
What record?

10:20.353 --> 10:21.377
Uhh!

10:21.420 --> 10:23.388
Aah! Aah! Ow! Aah!

10:23.422 --> 10:26.721
We better go, Meatwad,
before someone smells you.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.920
You think that was
a real live vampire?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.929
That was, wasn't it? Wasn't it?

10:30.963 --> 10:32.123
I don't know. Probably.

10:32.164 --> 10:33.426
Hey, y'all.
Check me out. Don't go.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.661
Y'all look. Look,
I'm a vampire now, y'all!

10:35.701 --> 10:37.601
Check me out.
I got... I got fangs.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.867
I got this bad-ass cape.
Wait a minute.

10:39.905 --> 10:42.738
- Aah!
- Whoa, man!

10:42.775 --> 10:44.868
Did you see Little Brittle?

10:44.910 --> 10:47.470
Because he's not supposed
to be out in the sunlight.

10:47.513 --> 10:48.605
No!

10:50.683 --> 10:53.880
Well, I guess
we'll never see him again.

10:53.919 --> 10:56.114
Yep. Not until next year.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.222
Hey, Satan, my man.

10:59.258 --> 11:01.692
Check it out, man.
I'm a bat, man.

11:01.727 --> 11:03.251
That's cool, right?

11:03.295 --> 11:06.287
Yeah, yeah. I see that.
What happened?

11:06.332 --> 11:07.560
Oh, come on, man.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.932
You know it don't matter
what I sa... aah!

11:09.969 --> 11:11.402
Please come visit me, dawg

11:11.437 --> 11:13.530
The residue of many
who are about to die

11:13.572 --> 11:15.631
Emit from the Tragic Castles
which I now reside

11:15.675 --> 11:18.166
Come before 7:00, that's when
they close the blinds

11:18.210 --> 11:20.610
Strap me down, steal my watch,
which is no surprise

11:20.646 --> 11:23.240
I suck applesauce
through a bendy straw

11:23.282 --> 11:25.648
When I poop, all the nurses
come in and applaud

11:25.685 --> 11:27.983
I used to slap with the babes,
used to bunk with broads

11:28.020 --> 11:29.146
Now my...
