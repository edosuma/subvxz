08:46.667 --> 08:48.600
WELCOME
TO MY DATE.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.000
I THANK YOU.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
MR. MATTHEWS,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.400
LOOK WHAT
WAS ACCIDENTALLY

08:54.400 --> 08:55.834
DELIVERED
TO MY HOUSE.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.100
YOU ALMOST GOT
AWAY WITH IT.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.200
AWAY WITH WHAT?

08:59.200 --> 09:01.033
YOU THOUGHT YOUR
PLOY WOULD WORK?

09:01.033 --> 09:03.033
I THOUGHT
I HAD A CHANCE.

09:03.033 --> 09:05.300
I HAD THIS MOMENT
OF WEAKNESS.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.400
WHAT I HAVE IN MY HAND,

09:07.400 --> 09:09.500
BECAUSE OF A DELIVERY
FOUL-UP...

09:09.500 --> 09:11.000
I'M SO SORRY,
MR. FEENY.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.700
IS A RECEIPT
FOR $3.75.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.100
PAY UP, BUCKO.

09:18.133 --> 09:21.100
I CAN'T GET
ANYTHING PAST YOU.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.133
HELLO.

09:22.133 --> 09:23.233
HERE YOU GO, MR. FEENY.

09:23.233 --> 09:26.000
HERE'S A FIVE.
YOU CAN KEEP THAT CHANGE.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.967
OH, JOY.
EARLY RETIREMENT.

09:28.967 --> 09:33.000
IS THIS
THE WEIRDEST DATE
YOU'VE EVER BEEN ON?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
NOT REALLY.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.133
ON ONE BLIND DATE,

09:35.133 --> 09:38.233
I GOT FIXED UP
WITH MY UNCLE MARY.

09:38.233 --> 09:39.233
LONG STORY.

09:39.233 --> 09:41.133
HEY, GEORGE.
HOW ARE YOU?

09:41.133 --> 09:43.000
JUST IN TIME
FOR COFFEE.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.600
DON'T MIND
IF I DO.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.100
IT'S DECAF THOUGH.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.667
COULD I JUST--

09:47.667 --> 09:48.700
NO.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.200
PEOPLE, PLEASE!

09:50.200 --> 09:52.767
CAN'T YOU SEE
THE MAN'S ON A DATE?

09:52.767 --> 09:54.834
I MEAN, THAT'S
VERONICA WATSON

09:54.834 --> 09:56.967
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.300
HEY. HEY! HEY!

10:05.300 --> 10:07.867
DON'T MAKE ME
COME BACK THERE.

10:07.867 --> 10:09.567
I'LL PULL
THIS CAR OVER.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.033
DON'T THINK I WON'T.

10:11.033 --> 10:12.300
OH, MY GOD.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.600
I'M TURNING
INTO MY FATHER.

10:18.467 --> 10:19.800
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE HERE.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.734
YOU THINK YOU
COULD TAKE IT

10:21.734 --> 10:24.200
AROUND THE BLOCK
A FEW MORE TIMES?

10:24.200 --> 10:25.600
OUT.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.200
GOOD NIGHT,
VERONICA.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.834
GOOD NIGHT.

10:31.934 --> 10:34.133
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.

10:43.834 --> 10:47.300
SHAWN, AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

10:47.300 --> 10:48.400
OH, YEAH.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.800
SORRY.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.000
NO. THE DOOR.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.300
WALK YOUR DATE
TO THE DOOR.

10:54.300 --> 10:56.967
I DON'T THINK SO.

10:56.967 --> 10:57.967
WHY NOT?

10:57.967 --> 11:00.300
IF I GET OUT
OF THIS CAR,

11:00.300 --> 11:03.200
I AIN'T NEVER
COMING BACK.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.500
SHAWN, FORGET IT.
THE DATE IS OVER.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.000
JUST TAKE
ANOTHER SHOWER.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.967
I USED UP
THE COLD WATER.

11:08.967 --> 11:11.734
COR, I GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

11:11.734 --> 11:13.300
I GOT TO SEE HER.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.867
NOW, THERE'S A SHOCK.

11:14.867 --> 11:16.100
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.100
SHAWN HUNTER
BREAKING CURFEW.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.300
ONE NIGHT
WHEN YOU STAY HERE,

11:20.300 --> 11:21.800
COULD YOU ACTUALLY...

11:21.800 --> 11:24.934
I DON'T KNOW...
STAY HERE.

11:27.033 --> 11:31.500
CORY, YOUR MOM AND
DAD ARE DOWN THERE
MAKING OUT.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.500
GOD BLESS 'EM.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.033
THEY'RE BLOCKING
MY ESCAPE ROUTE.

11:35.033 --> 11:37.667
HOW DO I GET
OUT OF HERE?

11:37.667 --> 11:38.734
ALL YOU--

11:38.734 --> 11:41.100
I CAN CLIMB
UP THE CHIMNEY--

11:41.100 --> 11:42.100
SHAWN.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.934
MY PARENTS ARE
IN THE BACKYARD.

11:43.934 --> 11:45.200
THAT'S WHAT I
BEEN TELLING YOU.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.300
SO THAT MEANS
MY FRONT DOOR,

11:47.300 --> 11:49.367
THAT BIG HUNK
OF WOOD,

11:49.367 --> 11:50.900
IS WIDE OPEN.

11:50.900 --> 11:54.400
CORY, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU SAYING?

11:54.400 --> 11:55.934
I'M SAYING

11:55.934 --> 11:59.667
YOU COULD GO OUT
THE FRONT DOOR.

11:59.667 --> 12:02.600
ME GO OUT
THE FRONT DOOR?

12:03.700 --> 12:04.800
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S SO CRAZY,

12:04.800 --> 12:06.934
IT JUST MIGHT WORK.

12:14.867 --> 12:19.300
PREPARE TO ENTER
HOTEL DEL SHAWN.

12:24.867 --> 12:26.867
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:26.867 --> 12:29.100
WHAT ARE <i>YOU </i>DOING HERE?

12:34.033 --> 12:35.133
THIS IS BAD.

12:35.133 --> 12:36.500
THIS IS BAD.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.133
IS THIS BAD?

12:38.133 --> 12:39.934
IT'S PRETTY
BAD, HONEY.

12:39.934 --> 12:43.100
JONATHAN,
THIS ISN'T WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.567
WHAT IS IT?

12:45.567 --> 12:46.834
YOU'RE HER
FAVORITE TEACHER,

12:46.834 --> 12:49.700
AND SHE WANTED TO
SEE WHERE YOU LIVE.

12:49.700 --> 12:50.700
NICE.

12:50.700 --> 12:52.967
THAT ABOUT WRAPS
UP THIS TOUR.

12:52.967 --> 12:54.600
NEXT STOP, FEENY'S.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.033
STAY!

12:57.567 --> 13:00.066
SHAWN, WHAT DO
YOU TAKE ME FOR?

13:00.066 --> 13:02.133
JONATHAN,
HOW ABOUT
I LEAVE NOW

13:02.133 --> 13:04.400
AND I'LL DROP
THIS GIRL OFF?

13:04.400 --> 13:05.400
O.K.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.867
ALL RIGHT. THANKS, KRIS.

13:06.867 --> 13:08.700
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.667
ALL RIGHT.

13:17.300 --> 13:20.667
SHAWN, WHAT COULD YOU
POSSIBLY BE THINKING?

13:20.667 --> 13:23.467
YOU SAW HER.
THERE'S NOTHING
TO THINK ABOUT.

13:23.467 --> 13:26.233
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE AT THE MATTHEWS'.

13:26.233 --> 13:27.900
IF I CAN'T
TRUST YOU--

13:27.900 --> 13:28.900
I'M SORRY.

13:28.900 --> 13:29.900
I'M SORRY.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.200
I REALLY AM.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.200
I JUST THOUGHT--

13:34.233 --> 13:35.233
HEY.

13:35.233 --> 13:36.500
HEY. WAIT A MINUTE.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.800
HOW WAS
THE WEDDING, PAL?

13:40.734 --> 13:42.367
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

13:42.367 --> 13:44.200
YEAH. YEAH.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.233
PITTSBURGH,

13:45.233 --> 13:47.667
THE BIG APPLE,
THE CITY OF ANGELS.

13:47.667 --> 13:50.000
WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE
OFF THE SUBJECT HERE.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
THAT TUXEDO.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.700
DOES IT COME
IN TUXEDO?

13:52.700 --> 13:54.800
HEY. ENOUGH.
I'M THE ADULT HERE.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.367
YOU'RE THE KID,
REMEMBER?

13:56.367 --> 13:59.100
THAT MEANS YOU CAN LIE,
AND I CAN'T.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.100
LOOK. I NEED
A LITTLE PRIVACY.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.834
I GOT MY OWN LIFE,
YOU KNOW?

14:03.834 --> 14:04.900
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW

14:04.900 --> 14:07.400
I WAS CRAMPING YOUR STYLE
BY LIVING HERE.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.400
IT'S MY PLACE.
I DON'T HAVE TO
DEFEND MYSELF.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.934
YEAH. YOUR PLACE.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.567
THAT SAYS IT ALL.

14:14.567 --> 14:17.000
SHAWN! HEY!

14:18.100 --> 14:20.834
[MOTORCYCLE ENGINE RUNNING]

14:29.000 --> 14:31.033
JONATHAN, WAS THAT
YOUR MOTORCYCLE

14:31.033 --> 14:34.033
OR DID THE SHUTTLE
JUST LAND?

14:34.033 --> 14:35.200
I'M SORRY TO WAKE YOU.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.400
I'M LOOKING FOR SHAWN.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.367
YES. WELL,
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT
ARRANGEMENT OF YOURS

14:39.367 --> 14:42.834
HAD THE POTENTIAL
OF RUINING ONE'S
PRIVATE LIFE.

14:42.834 --> 14:45.767
MY PRIVATE LIFE
IS FAR FROM RUINED.

14:45.767 --> 14:47.000
I MEANT MINE.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.033
[NANCY]
GEORGE.

14:48.033 --> 14:52.100
WHERE DO YOU
KEEP YOUR TOWELS?

14:56.500 --> 14:57.567
WELL,

14:57.567 --> 15:01.600
AS I SAID, I'LL BE
LATE MONDAY MORNING.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.033
DENTAL APPOINTMENT.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.100
DENTAL APPOINTMENT?

15:07.133 --> 15:09.133
SHE IS MY DENTIST.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.500
HI, JONATHAN.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.000
NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.
O.K. BYE-BYE.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.600
WAIT. WAIT.
ALAN. ALAN.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.200
I'M LOOKING

RIGHT THIS MOMENT?

15:20.400 --> 15:21.700
YEAH.

COME ON IN.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.133
SHAWN!

15:26.133 --> 15:29.700
COULD YOU, UH,
COME DOWN HERE PLEASE?

15:32.500 --> 15:34.233
AS YOU PROBABLY
CAN TELL,

15:34.233 --> 15:36.667
I AM NOT SHAWN.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.000
WHERE IS HE?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.767
WELL, THAT'S
THE BEAUTY HERE.

15:39.767 --> 15:40.967
I DON'T KNOW.

15:40.967 --> 15:43.667
I'M GLAD I DON'T
KNOW WHERE HE IS.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.767
FOR ONCE, I DON'T HAVE TO
COVER FOR HIM.

15:45.767 --> 15:47.400
FEELS GOOD
TELLING THE TRUTH.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.934
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

15:48.934 --> 15:51.000
GOOD NIGHT, CORY.

15:52.133 --> 15:56.033
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE IN PITTSBURGH?

15:57.100 --> 15:59.100
YEAH. YEAH.

16:00.700 --> 16:01.967
THAT HURT.

16:01.967 --> 16:03.000
WHAT HURT?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.400
WELL,
I--I MESSED UP.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.900
I TOLD SHAWN A LIE.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.467
I SAID I WAS
GOING OUT OF TOWN.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.400
I STAYED HERE
WITH A DATE.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.700
OOH. LET ME GUESS.

16:13.700 --> 16:17.000
SHAWN SHOWED UP
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND
AT YOUR APARTMENT

16:17.000 --> 16:19.500
AND CAUGHT YOU
AND YOUR DATE.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.233
OH, YOU'RE GOOD.

16:21.233 --> 16:23.667
A LOT OF YEARS, PAL.

16:23.667 --> 16:27.467
[AMY]
ALAN, THE BATHTUB IS FULL.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.934
THE CHAMPAGNE IS POURED,

16:30.934 --> 16:33.800
THE CANDLES ARE LIT,

16:33.800 --> 16:36.400
AND JONATHAN'S HERE.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.834
WHAT A SWEET
WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

16:38.834 --> 16:40.133
I'LL BE RIGHT UP.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.133
OH, GREAT.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.300
THEN WE CAN FINISH
THAT CONVERSATION

16:43.300 --> 16:44.867
WE WERE HAVING.

16:44.867 --> 16:46.567
NIGHT-NIGHT.

16:48.600 --> 16:49.934
SORRY.

16:49.934 --> 16:51.600
SO AM I.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.734
UH, LISTEN.

16:52.734 --> 16:55.300
I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF
AND LOOK FOR SHAWN.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.400
OH, REALLY? WHERE?

16:58.567 --> 16:59.967
I DON'T KNOW.

16:59.967 --> 17:01.100
WHAT WAS I THINKING

17:01.100 --> 17:03.934
WHEN I ASKED SHAWN
TO LIVE WITH ME?

17:03.934 --> 17:04.934
I'M SINGLE.

17:04.934 --> 17:07.300
I'M NOT READY
TO BE A PARENT.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.367
HEY. I GOT THREE KIDS,

17:09.367 --> 17:10.600
AND I'M STILL NOT READY.

17:10.600 --> 17:13.200
JONATHAN, I'VE SEEN
YOU WITH SHAWN.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.500
YOU'RE GREAT WITH HIM.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.200
I WASN'T SO GREAT
AN HOUR AGO.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.767
SO YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

17:18.767 --> 17:20.300
YOU DIDN'T BREAK HIM.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.767
YOU'RE ONLY HUMAN.

17:21.767 --> 17:23.600
WHY DO I FEEL
SO STUPID?

17:23.600 --> 17:26.100
WELL, WELCOME
TO THE PARENT CLUB.

17:26.100 --> 17:29.233
ALAN MATTHEWS,
MEMBER SINCE 1978.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.767
WHAT GOT YOU IN?

17:31.767 --> 17:33.100
FIRST TIME,
ERIC WAS 4.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.600
I LOST HIM IN
AN AMUSEMENT PARK.

17:35.600 --> 17:39.600
HE RODE THE COLOSSUS
FOR SIX HOURS.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.000
THE COLOSSUS?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.100
THE ONE WITH THE...

17:43.100 --> 17:44.100
MM-HMM.

17:44.100 --> 17:46.300
AND THEN THE...

17:46.300 --> 17:48.600
YEAH. YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE MISTAKES.

17:48.600 --> 17:52.233
THE TRICK IS LEARNING
HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM.

17:52.233 --> 17:53.667
THE MANHATTAN PROJECT

17:53.667 --> 17:55.700
DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN
IN NEW YORK.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.200
IT HAPPENED IN NEW MEXICO.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.500
WHAT A BUNCH A GOOFBALLS.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.934
CALL IT
THE NEW MEXICO PROJECT.

18:00.934 --> 18:02.133
WHO'S GOING TO KNOW?

18:02.133 --> 18:05.734
I COULD'VE BEEN
A SCIENTIST IF I WANTED.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.567
SIX HOURS, HUH?

18:08.567 --> 18:10.367
ROUND...

18:10.367 --> 18:11.567
AND ROUND...

18:11.567 --> 18:13.100
AND ROUND...

18:13.100 --> 18:15.033
AND ROUND.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.934
WHERE WERE YOU?

18:22.934 --> 18:25.200
ANOTHER WEDDING?

18:26.300 --> 18:28.967
I WAS OUT
LOOKING FOR YOU.

18:28.967 --> 18:30.700
YEAH, WELL,
I TOOK OFF.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.767
I REALIZED THERE WAS
NO PLACE TO GO,

18:33.767 --> 18:37.667
SO WHEN I GOT THERE
I CAME BACK.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.100
SO HERE YOU ARE.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.934
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

18:41.934 --> 18:44.600
YOU TELL ME.
YOU'RE THE ADULT.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.867
LISTEN.
I'M NEW AT THIS.

18:45.867 --> 18:48.600
I'M JUST MAKING THIS UP
AS I GO ALONG.

18:48.600 --> 18:52.033
YOU DIDN'T COME
WITH INSTRUCTIONS
THERE, SHAWN.

18:52.033 --> 18:54.100
YOU LIED TO ME.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.600
YEAH, I DID.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.800
SHAWN, I'M SORRY.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.300
I SHOULD'VE BEEN
STRAIGHT WITH YOU.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.300
YOU'RE NO ANGEL,
BY THE WAY.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.600
15-YEAR-OLD KIDS

19:02.600 --> 19:05.700
SHOULD NOT BE
BRINGING BACK GIRLS
TO EMPTY APARTMENTS.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.834
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO,
KICK ME OUT?

19:08.834 --> 19:11.300
EVERY TIME
ONE OF US MESSES UP

19:11.300 --> 19:14.100
DOESN'T MEAN SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO TAKE OFF.

19:14.100 --> 19:17.934
WE GOT TO TALK
THESE THINGS OUT. O.K.?

19:17.934 --> 19:20.100
LOOK, WE BOTH
MESSED UP.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.100
ALL RIGHT?

19:21.100 --> 19:25.000
WE'LL JUST
DO IT RIGHT NEXT TIME.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.200
DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE

19:29.200 --> 19:30.300
THE WALLS ARE CLOSING IN

19:30.300 --> 19:34.867
AND YOU GOT
NO PLACE TO GO
TO JUST BE ALONE?

19:34.867 --> 19:40.100
YEAH. THAT'S PROBABLY
WHY I TRIED TO RUN
MY LITTLE SCAM.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.100
THAT'S WHY I RAN MINE.

19:42.100 --> 19:46.200
LOOK, IF YOU
WANT TO BE ALONE
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

19:46.200 --> 19:47.600
YOU CAN JUST TELL ME.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.767
I CAN
FIND THINGS TO DO.

19:49.767 --> 19:51.200
LEGAL THINGS?

19:51.200 --> 19:52.900
IN CERTAIN STATES.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.300
O.K., I BELIEVE YOU.

19:55.300 --> 19:58.600
IF I WANT TO BE ALONE
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND,

19:58.600 --> 20:00.200
YOU'LL GET LOST,
TOO, RIGHT?

20:00.200 --> 20:03.767
HEY, I HAD
TO TAKE A SHOT.

20:05.867 --> 20:07.000
WE O.K.?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.500
YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.

20:15.567 --> 20:18.133
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.867
VERONICA'S
BEHIND THE COUCH,
ISN'T SHE?

20:20.867 --> 20:24.600
I WAS THAT CLOSE
TO TELLING YOU.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.133
HI, MR. TURNER.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.300
NICE PLACE.

20:27.300 --> 20:28.300
YEAH.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.867
HUH?
VERONICA WATSON!

20:39.934 --> 20:42.367
AH, MR. MATTHEWS,
THERE YOU ARE.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.100
I'VE JUST GRADED
YOUR PAPER.

20:44.100 --> 20:48.233
MAYBE IT WAS THE TOPIC
OR THE RIGHT MOOD.

20:48.233 --> 20:50.767
I ALMOST ENJOYED
WRITING THIS PAPER.

20:50.767 --> 20:51.967
INTERESTING, YES,

20:51.967 --> 20:56.500
BUT YOUR
ASSIGNED TOPIC WAS
THE MANHATTAN PROJECT.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.934
THE PAPER IN MY HAND
WITH YOUR NAME
ON THE COVER

20:58.934 --> 21:00.700
IS ABOUT
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.600
STRANGEST THING.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.300
OH, IT, UH--WHAT?

21:06.400 --> 21:07.600
WELL, IF I RECALL,

21:07.600 --> 21:09.867
THIS IS A COPY
OF A PAPER

21:09.867 --> 21:11.133
WRITTEN BY
SHAWN HUNTER
LAST YEAR--

21:11.133 --> 21:14.300
<i>ABRAHAM LINCOLN, </i>
<i>THE BEST BEARD </i>
<i>IN HISTORY. </i>

21:14.300 --> 21:17.867
I PARTICULARLY LIKED
HIS COMPARATIVE
ANALYSIS.

21:17.867 --> 21:19.834
"COLONEL SANDERS...

21:19.834 --> 21:22.200
WHAT'S UP
WITH THAT?"

21:22.200 --> 21:25.100
BUT MR. FEENY, SEE,
I PAID FOR THIS PAPER.

21:25.100 --> 21:28.367
I WROTE THIS PAPER.

21:28.367 --> 21:29.734
YOU GOT ME, O.K.?

21:29.734 --> 21:33.600
I ORDERED THE PAPER
THROUGH A TERM PAPER
WRITING SERVICE.

21:33.600 --> 21:37.000
UH-HUH. TERM PAPERS
BY GERARD.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
YES.

21:38.000 --> 21:38.834
THEY'RE GOOD.

21:38.834 --> 21:41.200
THAT STILL
DOESN'T EXPLAIN--

21:41.200 --> 21:44.100
HOW DID MY PAPER GET
SWITCHED WITH HUNTER'S?

21:44.100 --> 21:48.133
HEY, BIG BRO,
LIFE'S TOUGH.
GET A HELMET.

21:50.367 --> 21:55.867
I'VE GOT TO GO
MAKE MORE ROOM
AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE.

21:55.867 --> 21:58.600
AY YI YI AAH!
