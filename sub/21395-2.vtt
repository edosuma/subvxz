07:56.242 --> 07:58.911
- [roaring]

08:00.146 --> 08:01.981
- ANSI:
[gasps]

08:02.048 --> 08:03.716
- ALL:
[screaming]

08:05.351 --> 08:06.986
- That's the entrance
to the Stanza.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.721
It's the same mirror
I went through before.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.990
We've gotta follow him
and get my card back.

08:11.057 --> 08:13.492
- I'm not following him.
Are you crazy?

08:13.559 --> 08:14.627
- You wanna stay behind?

08:14.694 --> 08:16.095
- And get eaten
by that VW?

08:16.162 --> 08:19.332
- WP!
- W-ever.

08:19.398 --> 08:20.967
[groaning]

08:21.033 --> 08:22.802
- SARALINE:
[panting]

08:22.869 --> 08:24.036
- [panting]

08:24.103 --> 08:25.071
[gasps]

08:25.137 --> 08:26.405
Help!

08:26.472 --> 08:27.773
- Olly, use your grabvine.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.742
- [grunting]

08:32.445 --> 08:35.347
[grunting]

08:35.414 --> 08:37.482
- [growling]

08:40.720 --> 08:41.854
- And you wonder...

08:41.921 --> 08:43.823
why I never go
to the library.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.458
- [heavy thud]

08:48.761 --> 08:50.496
- Whoa, Julia!

08:50.563 --> 08:51.797
You okay?

08:51.864 --> 08:54.967
Please, say something.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.103
- Where is now?

08:57.169 --> 08:59.906
- Now is the Stanza.

08:59.972 --> 09:02.541
Everything we need to
know about the Wayne--

09:02.608 --> 09:04.944
what it is,
how to save it--

09:05.011 --> 09:07.680
I know it's in
this library.

09:07.747 --> 09:10.316
And we finally found it!

09:10.383 --> 09:11.617
Mwah!

09:11.684 --> 09:13.619
- [clears throat]
I found it a while ago.

09:13.686 --> 09:14.887
- Quiet, I'm floor kissing.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.056
- Are floors delicious?

09:17.123 --> 09:20.593
We surveyed 100 vacuum
cleaners to find out.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.762
- Saraline,
what happened to Julia?

09:22.828 --> 09:25.131
- Exactly what I said would
happen, you nuthin' muffin.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.033
You overloaded her brain
with Wayne stuff.

09:27.099 --> 09:29.535
- [gasps] Oh, is she
gonna be all right?

09:29.602 --> 09:30.870
- I'll look after her,

09:30.937 --> 09:32.805
since I'm clearly the
responsible one on this team.

09:32.872 --> 09:35.141
- Ouch! Watch where you're
throwing that shade.

09:35.207 --> 09:37.076
I'm taking collateral
shade damage here.

09:37.143 --> 09:38.878
I'm an innocent
shade-stander.

09:38.945 --> 09:40.646
- You done, or--
- Yeah, I'm good.

09:40.713 --> 09:41.948
- Okay.

09:42.014 --> 09:43.883
- Maybe there's a book in
here that can help Julia.

09:43.950 --> 09:46.619
You guys find Tony Stanza
and get that card back.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.521
- [heavy thud]
- OLLY: Gasp!

09:48.587 --> 09:50.022
- Go.

09:52.858 --> 09:55.861
- Aw, man, Olly, I feel terrible
about what's happened.

09:55.928 --> 09:59.265
- Ansi, so you compromised the
team by bringing in an outsider.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.766
That doesn't mean you
should be punished

10:00.833 --> 10:02.601
by non-stop knee tickleage.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.570
But if you insist.
- Compromise the team?

10:04.637 --> 10:07.907
No. I'm worried
about Julia.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.309
Frankly, I don't get
why you don't like her.

10:10.376 --> 10:11.510
- Oh, I like her.

10:11.577 --> 10:13.679
Her bald rodent.
How intrusive she is.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.614
The way she's stealing
my best friend.

10:15.681 --> 10:16.816
And don't call me frankly.

10:16.882 --> 10:18.617
- Olly, she's not
trying to steal me.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.086
Don't be paranoid.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.655
- You don't be big word--uh!
- [heavy thud]

10:22.722 --> 10:24.590
- This is Ms. Clara's cane.

10:24.657 --> 10:25.858
- The librarian?

10:25.925 --> 10:28.627
- I think she used it
to open these shelves.

10:28.694 --> 10:30.696
- [lock clicks]
- [gasps]

10:33.366 --> 10:34.400
- ANSI:
It's Tony Stanza.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.835
There he goes!

10:35.901 --> 10:38.070
- Say, how about we forget
all this and turn back?

10:38.137 --> 10:40.006
Just a random
cowardly thought.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.607
- We've gotta
get my card back.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.576
I have to know
why my name's on it.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.111
- I could write your
name on some other card.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.079
I'm pretty sure I know
all the letters.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.781
It starts with
the upside-down V, right?

10:48.848 --> 10:50.750
- Olly, help me.
Please.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.785
- [wind gusting]

10:58.657 --> 11:03.429
- Did you really think
this would stop me?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.597
- Nope.

11:04.663 --> 11:07.199
But it seemed pretty
distracting. Tony.

11:07.266 --> 11:10.403
- OLLY:
[panting]

11:10.469 --> 11:12.104
- Why do you call me Tony?

11:12.171 --> 11:14.974
- That's an inside joke
and you're on the outside.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.109
- Sorry, that was
uncalled for.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.178
He's really not
a mean person!

11:20.780 --> 11:22.281
- I got it.

11:25.885 --> 11:29.855
- Ugh, these are all written
in some arcane symbology.

11:29.922 --> 11:31.857
I can't understand
any of them.

11:31.924 --> 11:33.592
Not that you
can understand me.

11:33.659 --> 11:36.095
- Understanding is underrated.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.532
- Sit. Stay.

11:39.598 --> 11:41.067
Good Julia.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.969
And Mom wonders why I don't
have any friends.

11:44.036 --> 11:47.106
I'm seven years old and I have
to babysit everyone I meet.

11:47.173 --> 11:48.374
- Baby, sit.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.875
Baby, stay.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.811
Good baby, Julia.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.179
[sucking thumb]

11:53.245 --> 11:54.947
- You always struck me
as a pretty happy camper

11:55.014 --> 11:57.249
even before
your brainectomy.

11:57.316 --> 11:58.517
What's your secret?

11:58.584 --> 12:02.888
- The secret to happy camping
is a lack of bears!

12:02.955 --> 12:05.491
You should try
it sometime.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.293
- I'll take it
under advisement.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.097
- [panting]
Okay.

12:11.163 --> 12:13.866
Find Saraline and Julia,
then meet Ansi by the entrance,

12:13.933 --> 12:15.101
thus cementing
my place in his heart

12:15.167 --> 12:16.869
as his best
and most loyal--

12:16.936 --> 12:19.738
[gasps]
--friend.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.907
Or follow magical
flying card

12:21.974 --> 12:24.143
on unknown adventure
because shiny.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.052
- I know you're here...

12:33.119 --> 12:35.621
alone.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.057
What is it, Timbers?

12:38.124 --> 12:39.558
- [armor clanking]
- Aah!

12:39.625 --> 12:41.594
- Or Molina.

12:41.660 --> 12:42.695
- Who are you?

12:42.761 --> 12:44.597
How do you know my name?

12:44.663 --> 12:46.499
- I know much about you...

12:46.565 --> 12:49.835
and your
so-called friends.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.403
- [pillar thuds]

12:53.506 --> 12:55.141
- They are my friends!

12:55.207 --> 12:57.276
- Then where are they now?

12:59.211 --> 13:01.514
- I don't know where you're
taking me, but hurry up.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.982
I gotta get back to Ansi.

13:03.048 --> 13:04.283
And find Julia.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.384
And Saraline.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.153
And there's some TV
I gotta catch up on.

13:07.219 --> 13:09.688
"Bobby and Tommy" has its
midseason finale this week.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.757
Is it this week
or next week or--aah!

13:11.824 --> 13:13.159
- Aah!

13:13.225 --> 13:14.860
Shh! What are
you doing here?

13:14.927 --> 13:16.228
Where's Ansi?

13:16.295 --> 13:18.998
- Distracting Tony while
I follow this flying card.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.240
What is it?
Can it help Julia?

13:28.307 --> 13:30.209
- I haven't read
it yet, have I?

13:30.276 --> 13:32.011
- Does it at
least have a list

13:32.077 --> 13:33.812
of classic party games,
like lawn darts?

13:33.879 --> 13:35.247
Darn it, we don't
have a lawn!

13:35.314 --> 13:37.683
- In a post-
apocalyptic world,

13:37.750 --> 13:40.586
society has
become lawn-less!

13:40.653 --> 13:42.321
- ANSI: [screams]
- Ansi!

13:42.388 --> 13:44.356
- SARALINE: Go help him.
We'll meet you at the exit.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.058
- [panting]

13:48.460 --> 13:49.929
- [armor clanking]

13:49.995 --> 13:51.764
- [grunts of combat]

13:51.830 --> 13:52.965
- [sword clicks]
- Whoa!

13:53.032 --> 13:55.034
Okay, we'll do that.

13:57.870 --> 13:58.837
- Poor boy.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.973
Overmatched and all alone.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.910
- Hey, shut up,
you giant gassy gas giant.

14:04.977 --> 14:07.079
- [swords clanking]

14:08.847 --> 14:10.849
- You don't know me
or my friends.

14:10.916 --> 14:13.085
We're a team.
Team Timbers.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.454
Sure, it's got Olly's name
on it instead of mine,

14:15.521 --> 14:17.790
which bugs me a little bit,
but big deal.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.358
Aah!
He's a hero.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.593
- [scoffs]

14:20.659 --> 14:22.494
You really believe
in your...

14:22.561 --> 14:23.562
team.

14:23.629 --> 14:26.131
- Well, we tricked you
into following me

14:26.198 --> 14:27.833
when I don't even
have the card.

14:27.900 --> 14:28.867
- Huh?

14:28.934 --> 14:30.569
- So go Team Timbers.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.371
I've got so much
team spirit,

14:32.438 --> 14:34.873
I'm about to get some pom-poms
and join the cheering squad.

14:34.940 --> 14:37.042
That sounded tougher
in my head.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.980
- [sword clanks]
- [shield crashes]

14:41.046 --> 14:42.881
- Ansi, you got him!

14:42.948 --> 14:44.783
- When he zigged,
I zagged.

14:44.850 --> 14:46.919
That's why they call
me the Zig-Zag.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.554
Tell people to start
calling me that.

14:48.621 --> 14:49.922
- You got it, Zig-Zag.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.323
- That was
the adrenaline talking.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.758
Please forget
I ever said that.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.360
- You've got it,
Zig-Zag.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.962
Also, I heard the other
stuff you said.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.464
About the team.

14:58.530 --> 14:59.798
Thanks, buddy.

14:59.865 --> 15:02.167
Uh! Now come on.
Let's get outta here.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.869
I have to pee really bad.

15:03.936 --> 15:06.205
[panting]

15:07.239 --> 15:08.474
- Ooh!

15:08.540 --> 15:09.608
Ah...

15:09.675 --> 15:11.010
- Hold on now, Julia.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.177
Your brain's another story,

15:12.244 --> 15:14.146
but I think I know what
to do with this--

15:15.347 --> 15:16.582
--card.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.450
- It's over.

15:18.517 --> 15:20.319
Now go.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.622
- Yay!
[clapping]

15:26.058 --> 15:27.159
- OLLY:
[panting]

15:27.226 --> 15:29.528
- Oh, what happened?
You guys okay?

15:29.595 --> 15:31.363
- They were just leaving.
- ANSI: [gasps]

15:31.430 --> 15:34.233
- He got the card.
Sorry, Ansi.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.634
- The card didn't
belong to you.

15:35.701 --> 15:39.672
Neither does this.
- The card has my name on it.

15:39.738 --> 15:42.241
Usually when things have your
name on it, they belong to you.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.609
It doesn't mean you have--
- It means I can have--

15:43.676 --> 15:45.244
- all my toys if you write--
- all your toys if I write--

15:45.311 --> 15:46.345
- your name on them.
- my name on them.

15:46.412 --> 15:47.846
- BOTH: I'm sort of shocked--

15:47.913 --> 15:49.348
- you haven't tried it already.
- I haven't tried it already.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.650
- I know you're disappointed.
- Listen...

15:51.717 --> 15:53.252
- But fate has spoken.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.788
- No, stop.
You don't understand.

15:55.854 --> 15:56.855
The mirror!

15:56.922 --> 15:58.791
- And this is for the best.

15:58.857 --> 16:01.960
- [mirror cracking]

16:02.027 --> 16:05.197
- [roaring, hissing]
- ALL: [scream]

16:14.973 --> 16:16.308
- ALL:
[gasping]

16:16.375 --> 16:17.943
- [roaring]
- [hissing]

16:18.010 --> 16:18.977
- [heavy thud]

16:19.044 --> 16:20.079
- [hissing]

16:20.145 --> 16:21.714
- What the jiminies
is that thing?

16:21.780 --> 16:24.183
- I don't know, but I can free
associate, if you want.

16:24.249 --> 16:26.552
Air pump. Uh, bicycle pump.
Fire pump.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.787
Why didn't you tell me
I had a pump fixation?

16:28.854 --> 16:31.457
- SARALINE: It's the same WP
that was stalking us before.

16:31.523 --> 16:33.459
- [growling]

16:34.493 --> 16:35.928
- [clicking]

16:35.994 --> 16:38.263
- [gasps]
Thanks.

16:46.438 --> 16:48.273
- You guys get Julia
out of here!

16:48.340 --> 16:49.375
- What about you?

16:49.441 --> 16:50.809
- I'm not leaving
without that card.

16:50.876 --> 16:53.245
- And I'm not leaving
without my best friend.

16:53.312 --> 16:54.513
- Thanks, pal.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.515
- Oh, fine.
So, no one's leaving.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.016
- ALL:
[gasp]

16:58.083 --> 16:59.685
- JULIA: What a little
sick little animal

16:59.752 --> 17:02.955
who needs this
