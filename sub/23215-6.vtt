WEBVTT

00:01.319 --> 00:03.340
Please no water bill,
please no water bill,

00:03.365 --> 00:05.508
please no water bill,
please no water bill.

00:05.533 --> 00:08.468
I told you, move into a place
where utilities are included.

00:08.493 --> 00:10.864
- You don't listen.
- Are utilities included

00:10.889 --> 00:12.289
in the house that
your parents bought you?

00:12.314 --> 00:13.475
They didn't get me a house.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.789
They got my brother a house,
and I just live there, but...

00:15.869 --> 00:17.236
yeah, utilities are included.

00:17.261 --> 00:19.031
Oh, my God, it's them. Act normal.

00:19.097 --> 00:20.910
They're just your neighbors.
Just say hi.

00:20.931 --> 00:23.396
I can't just say hi
to women like this, okay?

00:23.421 --> 00:24.980
They have perfect hair,

00:25.021 --> 00:26.448
they have this magical smell,

00:26.473 --> 00:28.769
and people are always
leaving their apartment

00:28.794 --> 00:30.160
happier than when they went in.

00:30.185 --> 00:31.640
They're coming. Say something smart.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.906
What kind of smart?
Book smart or regular smart?

00:33.946 --> 00:35.767
Just smart smart.

00:35.817 --> 00:37.629
And that's when I said, "Listen",

00:37.654 --> 00:40.010
"the data has been compromised."

00:41.365 --> 00:42.553
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:42.578 --> 00:44.208
- We're neighbors, right?
- That's right.

00:44.233 --> 00:46.997
I'm Rose, and this is my wife, Camille.

00:47.031 --> 00:49.603
I'm Esther, and this is my wife, Benji.

00:49.810 --> 00:51.112
You'll have to excuse her.

00:51.137 --> 00:53.960
She usually makes, like,
15% to 20% more sense.

00:54.140 --> 00:56.327
We just saw a 3D movie,
and she's sort of like,

00:56.352 --> 00:57.380
frazzled and stuff.

00:57.405 --> 00:58.833
Don't you love those? It's incredible

00:58.858 --> 00:59.902
what they can do with computers now.

00:59.927 --> 01:03.003
I use computers. I do.

01:03.758 --> 01:06.027
Well, this has been... fun.

01:06.052 --> 01:08.013
We should do it again... sometime.

01:08.038 --> 01:09.333
Yeah, get together or something.

01:09.358 --> 01:11.760
Really? Oh, I would
do anything. Dinner?

01:11.785 --> 01:14.186
Tonight? Right now?
What do you guys think?

01:15.428 --> 01:17.388
- Yeah.
- Sure. Like 7:00?

01:17.413 --> 01:18.815
I was gonna say 7:00.

01:19.632 --> 01:21.336
Triple jinx.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.634
Okay, perfect. We'll see you then.

01:23.836 --> 01:25.155
We will see you then.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.563
Can we, um, bring anything?

01:26.619 --> 01:29.156
Please, no. Don't you bring a thing.

01:29.181 --> 01:31.582
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

01:31.607 --> 01:34.197
Perfect. I'll see you then.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.536
What, are you Rachael Ray?

01:36.561 --> 01:37.827
You're gonna make
people dinner tonight?

01:37.852 --> 01:38.871
I guess they'll bring it.

01:38.896 --> 01:40.264
You just told them
not to bring anything.

01:40.289 --> 01:43.327
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:47.004 --> 01:48.750
This has to go really well, right?

01:48.816 --> 01:51.476
These women could be
the perfect mentors for me.

01:51.816 --> 01:54.244
I feel like mentors
aren't a real thing,

01:54.311 --> 01:57.080
and you should just read a book
on leadership or something.

01:57.425 --> 01:59.389
Benji, mentorship is very real.

01:59.414 --> 02:00.817
Look at me. My life's a mess.

02:00.851 --> 02:02.919
Ever since Oprah went off
the air, I stopped growing.

02:02.953 --> 02:04.832
The only way I'm ever
gonna become a powerful woman

02:04.857 --> 02:06.765
is if I have one around me
to copy off of.

02:06.790 --> 02:09.092
- Tonight, I could have two.
- All right, all right.

02:09.417 --> 02:10.727
Ask them to be your mentors.

02:10.761 --> 02:12.834
You can't just ask, or maybe you can.
I don't know.

02:12.859 --> 02:15.302
- That's why I need a mentor.
- That's why you need a CAT scan.

02:15.327 --> 02:17.200
I don't know what I'm doing, okay.

02:17.234 --> 02:19.733
Realistically, the only
dinner party I ever went to

02:19.758 --> 02:21.715
was the wake after
my great-aunt's funeral,

02:21.740 --> 02:24.797
and it did not go well, okay.

02:24.822 --> 02:27.457
The turnout was low, my parents
got into a huge fight,

02:27.491 --> 02:29.129
- I had a stomachache.
- Okay, fine,

02:29.154 --> 02:30.556
 I'll help you with the food.

02:30.581 --> 02:33.306
- Really?
- I've been to a million dinner parties.

02:33.470 --> 02:35.130
I can make a cheese plate in my sleep.

02:35.185 --> 02:37.233
Okay, great. Thank you so much.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.258
And you know what?

02:38.283 --> 02:40.333
I'm gonna do something
really important, too.

02:40.358 --> 02:42.315
I'm gonna sit in
the bathtub and visualize

02:42.340 --> 02:43.727
this night going perfectly.

02:43.752 --> 02:45.460
Okay, here's a thing.
Instead of visualizing,

02:45.485 --> 02:46.833
I think you should
clean your apartment,

02:46.858 --> 02:49.288
because it looks like
the returns counter at Ross.

02:49.555 --> 02:51.693
Ross is a successful
corporation, so thank you.

02:51.718 --> 02:52.880
Seriously, dude, tidy up.

02:52.905 --> 02:55.568
Okay. Well, this is my taste, so...

02:58.842 --> 03:00.376
Rotisserie chicken for one?

03:00.737 --> 03:02.686
No, but that's very perceptive of you

03:02.711 --> 03:04.274
to pick up my lonely vibes.

03:04.336 --> 03:06.321
It's for a dinner party.

03:07.144 --> 03:10.643
Um... just drinking
soy milk straight up like that.

03:10.668 --> 03:12.235
It's kind of bad for your system.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.067
I just stopped drinking it
because it was making

03:14.092 --> 03:15.893
my genitals kind of atrophy.

03:15.918 --> 03:18.122
- Neat.
- And you should be extra careful,

03:18.147 --> 03:20.573
because soy can trigger
breast cancer in women.

03:20.598 --> 03:22.932
Um, I'm sorry, are you,
like, a doctor or something?

03:22.957 --> 03:24.557
No. Why? What does that matter?

03:24.582 --> 03:26.428
You have, like, a lot of opinions

03:26.453 --> 03:29.756
about breast cancer and what
I'm putting into my body.

03:29.781 --> 03:31.417
Well, you appear
to have a healthy body,

03:31.442 --> 03:33.576
and your breasts look healthy also,

03:33.724 --> 03:35.465
so I thought you would wanna know.

03:35.490 --> 03:37.711
Do you think it's okay that
you're talking about my breasts?

03:37.736 --> 03:39.485
I mean, I talked about my genitals...

03:39.510 --> 03:41.439
Why are we talking
about your genitals?!

03:41.464 --> 03:42.592
I don't know, we're all human,

03:42.617 --> 03:44.617
and we're gonna die one day,
and let's talk about

03:44.642 --> 03:46.836
the things that make us mortal.
I don't know.

03:46.861 --> 03:47.892
You need to go.

03:47.917 --> 03:49.453
- I have to go?
- Out that door.

03:49.581 --> 03:52.328
- Are you mad at me?
- Do you bring your bags?

03:57.615 --> 04:00.292
Hey, are these statement glasses
too much of a statement?

04:00.317 --> 04:01.790
I'm trying to say "I need your help,"

04:01.815 --> 04:03.449
but without an exclamation point.

04:03.474 --> 04:05.876
You shouldn't ask me anything.
I'm such an idiot, man.

04:06.057 --> 04:07.606
The cashier at that market

04:07.631 --> 04:09.795
pretty much accused me
of being a misogynist,

04:09.820 --> 04:11.117
and I was just trying to be nice.

04:11.142 --> 04:12.510
Yeah, that co-op is scary.

04:12.535 --> 04:14.063
One time, I forgot to bring my bag,

04:14.088 --> 04:16.903
and they made me carry my
groceries out in my sweatshirt.

04:16.928 --> 04:18.370
- - Oh,
my God, they're early.

04:18.394 --> 04:19.550
It's a power move, I think.

04:19.575 --> 04:22.774
Wait. I have to answer.
It'll send the wrong message.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.025
Welcome!

04:25.076 --> 04:26.777
Hi.

04:26.965 --> 04:28.684
Oh, it's so cute!

04:28.797 --> 04:30.088
We got you a little something.

04:30.113 --> 04:31.730
Are you kidding me? Thank you.

04:31.755 --> 04:34.125
I love a little something.
You should have.

04:34.197 --> 04:36.691
- Oh, so cute.
- Yeah.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.096
Cute's for babies.

04:39.121 --> 04:40.922
You guys are cute, though.

04:41.297 --> 04:43.920
Um, appetizers or anything?

04:43.945 --> 04:46.708
I can get you a tartine
with a sheep's milk cheese

04:46.789 --> 04:48.976
that was pre-made,
but I'll take credit for it.

04:49.051 --> 04:50.849
- Oh, sure.
- That'll be great.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.473
We're famished. We've been walking...

04:52.498 --> 04:54.899
Oh, honey, 17,000 steps today.

04:54.991 --> 04:57.835
17,000? Get out of here!

04:57.913 --> 04:59.180
In those wedges?

04:59.536 --> 05:01.904
Exercise is good for you.

05:01.938 --> 05:03.772
So, kids, what's on the menu?

05:03.840 --> 05:05.387
Tonight, we are preparing

05:05.412 --> 05:08.967
a rotisserie chicken, and it's
actually a wonderful recipe.

05:08.992 --> 05:11.242
I got it off Elizabeth
Warren's Pinterest page.

05:11.267 --> 05:12.676
She's a senator.

05:12.701 --> 05:15.142
And then, for dessert,
we are going to do

05:15.167 --> 05:16.201
Esther cake.

05:16.226 --> 05:17.493
It's a homemade cake.

05:17.667 --> 05:18.989
We love cake, Esther.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.716
I love cake... the most. I love it.

05:22.111 --> 05:23.979
Hey, hey.

05:24.627 --> 05:25.761
Come here.

05:26.403 --> 05:28.246
Please excuse me for one moment.

05:28.271 --> 05:30.906
♪ Don't touch that dial ♪

05:31.194 --> 05:32.356
What's up?

05:32.381 --> 05:34.710
Okay, so I was really
frazzled at the market,

05:34.735 --> 05:36.704
and I think I forgot
one of the bags there.

05:36.806 --> 05:39.663
So all that we have
is lettuce and toilet paper.

05:39.963 --> 05:41.985
- Wait, what?
- There's no rotisserie chicken.

05:42.010 --> 05:44.382
Do you think they would eat
a toilet paper salad?

05:44.407 --> 05:46.127
What is this, Panda Express?
I don't think so.

05:46.152 --> 05:47.480
Okay, so obviously,

05:47.505 --> 05:49.597
we can't throw a dinner
party without dinner.

05:49.632 --> 05:51.313
'Cause then it would just
be a regular party,

05:51.338 --> 05:53.032
and I didn't make
the right playlist for that.

05:53.057 --> 05:54.748
Okay, I think
we should just reschedule.

05:54.805 --> 05:57.274
Yeah. I'm gonna tell them
that you pooped your pants.

05:57.299 --> 05:59.203
No, don't... okay, fine.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.462
But just tell them
it's not a regular thing.

06:00.487 --> 06:02.575
I'm not making any promises.

06:02.665 --> 06:04.254
Why don't we just go back to the store,

06:04.279 --> 06:05.507
and we can pick up the food?

06:05.532 --> 06:08.246
I'm so glad you heard us.
That's a great idea.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.538
I can't go back to that co-op.
I'm not welcome there.

06:11.245 --> 06:12.867
- Why not?
- Why not?

06:12.892 --> 06:14.026
People think when you're a man,

06:14.051 --> 06:15.619
you can't be a victim,
but when you're short

06:15.644 --> 06:17.226
and opinionated,
it happens more than you think.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.756
It'll be fine. I'll go with you.

06:18.848 --> 06:20.815
She'll go with you.
It's gonna be great.

06:20.863 --> 06:23.197
We can mix it up
and get to know each other.

06:23.985 --> 06:25.518
Oh, my God, like a one-on-one.

06:25.543 --> 06:28.293
- Yeah.
- Benji, please go.

06:28.318 --> 06:30.552
We'll never make it
to hometowns if you don't.

06:30.893 --> 06:33.456
- Will you keep me safe?
- Trust.

06:33.789 --> 06:36.224
Come on. I got you.

06:37.220 --> 06:39.020
We'll be back.

06:39.795 --> 06:41.178
Are you braiding my hair?

06:41.203 --> 06:42.736
Yeah. It's a loose French braid.

06:42.761 --> 06:44.495
It's gonna look amazing.

06:45.074 --> 06:46.575
Okay.

06:51.377 --> 06:53.421
It's not like I wanna
make people angry.

06:53.537 --> 06:55.929
I wanna be liked
by everyone all the time.

06:55.954 --> 06:58.122
It's paralyzing when
I say stupid stuff.

06:58.349 --> 07:00.917
You know what, Benji, I'm just
gonna be stern with you,

07:01.112 --> 07:03.013
because you seem to respond better

07:03.173 --> 07:04.623
when people tell you what to do.

07:04.648 --> 07:06.783
- That's true. You're very perceptive.
- Thank you.

07:06.808 --> 07:08.774
Now go over there and apologize to her.

07:08.799 --> 07:10.455
Yeah, I don't like that.
That's not my thing.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.446
Benji, did you or did you not tell me

07:12.471 --> 07:14.445
you were being
an asshole to this woman?

07:14.470 --> 07:15.510
I guess.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.336
Man up. <i>Man up.</i>

07:18.219 --> 07:19.401
Let's go.

07:19.426 --> 07:20.563
Okay, fine. You have to come with me.

07:20.597 --> 07:22.172
Okay. You first.

07:22.399 --> 07:24.406
Do you think I have
enough to make a salad?

07:24.495 --> 07:26.959
I have a cheddar, a Swiss,

07:26.984 --> 07:28.718
and a cheddar-Swiss blend.

07:29.170 --> 07:31.096
Yeah, okay. That'll work. Take 'em out.

07:31.121 --> 07:33.322
Let's start unpeeling,
and, uh, let's see.

07:33.347 --> 07:35.227
I will take this cranberry juice,

07:35.252 --> 07:36.585
and make a reduction.

07:36.610 --> 07:38.554
- Start stringing those.
- Okay.

07:38.987 --> 07:40.717
Um, what are you looking for?

07:41.006 --> 07:42.346
Whatever wants to be found.

07:42.371 --> 07:44.472
Wow.

07:45.136 --> 07:47.290
Um, hey, Camille,

07:47.324 --> 07:50.028
do you know those salads
that taste really good...

07:50.053 --> 07:51.807
like they don't even taste like salads,

07:51.832 --> 07:55.224
but you don't know why.
Do you know why?

07:55.432 --> 07:58.234
What makes a really good
salad is minced garlic.

07:58.305 --> 07:59.672
That's garlic?

07:59.697 --> 08:01.064
Actually, candied walnuts are better,

08:01.089 --> 08:02.969
but you don't have walnuts,
so we're gonna mince garlic.

08:02.994 --> 08:04.210
- Got it.
- I'll show you how.

08:04.235 --> 08:06.183
Just take a clove. This is a clove.

08:06.230 --> 08:08.836
- It's like a petal.
- Of course. Right.

08:08.873 --> 08:10.640
Now pick up your knife.

08:11.377 --> 08:13.029
And you're not gonna
cut, you're gonna press.

08:13.054 --> 08:15.055
So you're gonna lay it flat.
There you go.

08:15.098 --> 08:17.207
- - Oh,
shoot, someone's here.

08:17.602 --> 08:19.136
Benji must've forgot his keys.

08:19.369 --> 08:21.105
You gave him keys to your apartment?

08:21.130 --> 08:22.930
He doesn't deserve them,
does he? I'll take them away.

08:22.996 --> 08:25.520
I'll take them away right now.

08:27.111 --> 08:29.312
Oh, no, game night. No, no, no.

08:29.627 --> 08:31.461
No. You didn't forget again.

08:31.486 --> 08:34.087
My iCal hasn't been syncing. I'm
going through an Apple change.

08:34.171 --> 08:36.043
Well, come on, man,
let's get this thing started.

08:36.068 --> 08:37.469
We're having a dinner
party, you gotta go.

08:37.494 --> 08:39.162
- Great. I'm starving.
- No, you can't...

08:39.187 --> 08:41.020
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:41.158 --> 08:43.693
- Look, a new friend.
- New friend? Old friend.

08:43.717 --> 08:45.063
We've been friends for years.

08:45.088 --> 08:46.956
New friend for me. Come on in.

08:46.981 --> 08:48.782
- I'm Jeff.
- A pleasure. Camille.

08:49.019 --> 08:51.243
I was just offering
Jeff a glass of water.

08:51.268 --> 08:52.481
What a wonderful host.

08:52.506 --> 08:54.426
We have plenty of
drizzle for everybody.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.586
Jeff loves drizzle.

08:57.319 --> 08:59.254
Thank you.

08:59.710 --> 09:01.277
- Gianna.
- Hi.

09:01.732 --> 09:03.084
Oh, great.

09:03.199 --> 09:04.944
As we practiced.

09:05.209 --> 09:07.483
I'm sorry I tried
explaining something to you

09:07.508 --> 09:08.914
that you might've already known.

09:08.939 --> 09:11.145
You know damn well what
you're putting in your body,

09:11.170 --> 09:12.861
and I shouldn't have said anything.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.818
Oh, okay.

09:14.885 --> 09:16.319
Thank you.

09:16.344 --> 09:18.579
Sometimes I just wanna be helpful,

09:18.604 --> 09:21.360
and the tone I use makes it sound
like I know better than you,

09:21.385 --> 09:24.049
when I don't. I'm...

09:26.050 --> 09:29.478
I'm just a weak man with an
unnecessarily strong point of view.

09:29.660 --> 09:31.294
Amen.

09:31.598 --> 09:32.906
Thank you for that.

09:32.931 --> 09:35.292
- Here is your bag.
- Ah, thanks.

09:35.332 --> 09:37.533
- All right, bye, girl.
- Bye, babe.

09:37.987 --> 09:39.620
- See ya.
- Bye.

09:39.696 --> 09:41.961
- I'm making dinner tonight.
- Good. Enjoy your dinner.

09:41.986 --> 09:44.053
Thank you. She's cool.

09:44.078 --> 09:45.302
- Yeah.
- I should give her a hug.

09:45.327 --> 09:48.196
No hug. No hug, no touching.

09:49.649 --> 09:51.990
Wow. This looks great.

09:52.463 --> 09:55.964
Camille, do you have, like, a
background in interior design,

09:55.989 --> 09:57.604
because you're just so intuitive.

09:57.629 --> 10:00.341
Yes, I do. Nate Berkus and
I have the same hypnotist.

10:00.383 --> 10:02.791
Oh, my gosh. Wow, feng shui is real.

10:03.422 --> 10:05.323
And multivitamins are...

10:05.395 --> 10:06.980
- Very real.
- Yes.

10:07.050 --> 10:09.819
- And 401(k)'s?
- Important. A self-IRA works, too.

10:09.844 --> 10:11.978
- How about flossing?
- Occasionally. Once a week is fine.

10:12.062 --> 10:14.545
Should I be more worried
about under my eyes or my neck?

10:14.570 --> 10:15.737
Actually, you know what's weird?

10:15.762 --> 10:17.363
- It's your hands.
- Of course.

10:17.968 --> 10:19.569
- They give it away.
- 100%

10:19.594 --> 10:21.678
Excuse me. Is El Chupacabra real?

10:21.703 --> 10:23.795
You mean the Mexican vampire weasel?

10:23.820 --> 10:25.337
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm not sure about that.

10:25.362 --> 10:26.537
Okay.

10:26.562 --> 10:28.062
This is coming together.
We need seating.

10:28.087 --> 10:29.976
Yes, we do. We do need seating.

10:30.001 --> 10:31.623
- Hey, Cami.
- How'd it go?

10:31.648 --> 10:33.713
You won't believe how brave Benji was.

10:33.738 --> 10:36.873
He apologized to a woman... in public.

10:37.060 --> 10:39.127
Oh, my God. Did you
really do that, Benji?

10:39.152 --> 10:40.620
It wasn't a big deal.

10:40.858 --> 10:42.639
Since we're all back,
I wanna take a second,

10:42.664 --> 10:44.632
and show you guys
something very special.

10:44.927 --> 10:46.846
Wait, so what happened?
I want to hear it.

10:46.871 --> 10:49.728
This was a huge deal.
This is real growth.

10:49.753 --> 10:51.726
I mean, it felt courageous,

10:51.751 --> 10:53.952
but I couldn't have
done it without Rose.

10:54.498 --> 10:56.466
She's my rock. I mean, she's your rock.

10:56.660 --> 10:57.971
In that moment, she was my rock, too.

10:57.996 --> 10:59.630
- I'll share my rock.
- Thanks for rock sharing.

11:02.152 --> 11:04.836
Wait, what are you... oh, right.

11:04.861 --> 11:07.430
- Game night.
- Y'all bullshit people.

11:07.784 --> 11:08.897
I love you, dude.

11:08.926 --> 11:11.129
So one night, I was up late,

11:11.154 --> 11:13.356
my parents were asleep,
I ordered these on QVC.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.094
They're Princess Diana
commemorative dishware.

11:16.119 --> 11:18.387
I really admire her for
her strength and her beauty,

11:18.412 --> 11:19.654
but mostly her beauty.

11:20.063 --> 11:22.832
I'm sorry. I think maybe
you should set those,

11:22.857 --> 11:23.945
and get the table ready,

11:23.970 --> 11:25.150
and I'm just gonna help
Benji out in the kitchen,

11:25.175 --> 11:26.926
'cause I really wanna hear
more about his breakthrough.

11:26.989 --> 11:30.240
Oh, actually, um... I think I
would be best suited doing

11:30.265 --> 11:31.632
whatever it is that you're doing.

11:31.666 --> 11:33.054
I'm an excellent copycat.

11:33.079 --> 11:34.131
But we need someone to do this,

11:34.156 --> 11:35.318
so you do that and we'll do this.

11:35.343 --> 11:36.360
- Then we'll come back.
- Okay.

11:36.385 --> 11:38.699
Where were you guys
when Princess Diana died?

11:39.594 --> 11:41.774
- It was amazing.
- Thank you.

11:41.799 --> 11:44.041
Hey, these women are so much fun.

11:44.066 --> 11:45.989
They're great. They're very great.

11:46.014 --> 11:47.781
My Pilates instructor, Benji,

11:47.806 --> 11:50.249
can make you stand an inch taller.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.531
Oh, my God, that sounds great,
but I feel taller already.

11:53.575 --> 11:55.057
Jeff, I wanna feel taller.

11:55.168 --> 11:57.222
My transformation's
slipping away from me.

11:57.247 --> 11:59.369
Maybe there's a scenario
where everybody wins.

11:59.394 --> 12:00.728
Jeff, you wanted to play a game?

12:00.816 --> 12:03.177
Guess what. Tonight,
we're gonna play a game,

12:03.272 --> 12:05.974
and the prize is those women,
and I'm gonna win them.

12:06.141 --> 12:08.071
I don't think you should
say things like that.

12:15.432 --> 12:18.859
As you know, there's an obesity
epidemic in this country, so...

12:18.906 --> 12:20.140
to control my metabolism,

12:20.165 --> 12:22.399
I eat 20 really small meals a day.

12:22.563 --> 12:24.474
If it's bigger than my hand, I
won't even put it in my mouth.

12:24.499 --> 12:27.520
Yeah, it's so important to
treat your body like a temple,

12:27.602 --> 12:29.482
or however you choose to worship.

12:29.507 --> 12:32.014
And that reminds me of this think piece

12:32.044 --> 12:33.596
I recently read about Gwyneth.

12:33.621 --> 12:35.929
I know we all have
mixed feelings about her.

12:35.977 --> 12:38.148
But Gloria Steinem
had actually reposted it,

12:38.173 --> 12:40.541
so I feel comfortable bringing
it up at the dinner table.

12:40.566 --> 12:42.747
Oh, Gloria. She's so inspirational.

12:42.904 --> 12:44.705
We have every last one of her books.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.681
If you wanna borrow one,
just let us know.

12:46.706 --> 12:48.736
I would love that.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.949
Say good-bye to that book.

12:52.018 --> 12:54.130
Funny thing about reading.
I'm a speed reader.

12:54.155 --> 12:55.852
I'm not formally trained or anything,

12:55.877 --> 12:58.812
but my words per minute
is pretty off the chain.

12:58.886 --> 13:00.195
Huh.

13:00.220 --> 13:02.111
I was in a gifted program growing up,

13:02.136 --> 13:04.037
and I actually read books
back to front.

13:04.212 --> 13:06.495
It's a Japanese tradition
that I've adopted.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.628
In all fairness, though,

13:07.653 --> 13:09.522
I have a biological
advantage with reading,

13:09.547 --> 13:11.643
because I have very thick corneas.

13:12.018 --> 13:13.591
Makes me a great candidate for Lasik.

13:13.616 --> 13:15.537
I actually, whenever
I take a dance class,

13:15.562 --> 13:17.599
the teacher always asks me
to stand in the front row,

13:17.645 --> 13:20.158
just so that I can set a good
example, and other students

13:20.183 --> 13:22.349
- can learn from me and my form.
- Okay.

13:22.374 --> 13:24.241
I took the hardship of being
raised by a housekeeper,

13:24.266 --> 13:25.835
and turned it into being bilingual.

13:25.860 --> 13:28.003
<i>Que bueno. Me gusta la playa.</i>

13:28.028 --> 13:30.141
<i>- ¿Que esta pasando?
- Not much.</i>

13:30.337 --> 13:33.122
I actually went to the most diverse
high school in the nation.

13:33.147 --> 13:34.566
We had a pep assembly about it.

13:34.591 --> 13:37.527
I think it's called assimilation.
I'm sort of a wordsmith.

13:37.552 --> 13:39.018
I can do a perfect
cartwheel from memory.

13:39.043 --> 13:40.102
Do you guys wanna see?

13:40.127 --> 13:41.327
What do you mean, from memory?

13:41.588 --> 13:43.250
Like, I have it memorized.

13:43.331 --> 13:45.761
Hey, Esther, shouldn't we
serve our guests dessert

13:45.786 --> 13:48.111
before the acrobatic
portion of this evening?

13:48.223 --> 13:49.893
I think that's wise.

13:50.323 --> 13:52.791
So I think you should
just sort of chill out a little,

13:52.833 --> 13:54.065
'cause I'm killing it.

13:54.288 --> 13:56.698
Remember that you're not supposed
to be killing it tonight,

13:56.723 --> 13:58.581
because you think mentors are stupid?

13:58.713 --> 14:01.700
I changed my mind, okay?
Maybe I want mentors, too.

14:01.981 --> 14:04.362
They're really body positive
with me, and I feel safe

14:04.424 --> 14:06.023
asking them pretty much any question.

14:06.048 --> 14:08.516
You are a man, and you feel
safe asking anyone anything.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.825
I'm small, and everywhere I go,
life is a threat.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.257
Those women are mine.

14:13.282 --> 14:15.599
Did you ever think that
maybe those women

14:15.624 --> 14:19.282
don't like being referred to
as objects that can be owned?

14:19.333 --> 14:22.741
Did you ever think that that's
not really how you talk, right?

14:22.904 --> 14:24.399
Oh, 'cause this is how you talk?

14:24.424 --> 14:26.342
Yeah, and you know what I was thinking?

14:26.367 --> 14:28.368
Maybe we should just go out there,

14:28.549 --> 14:30.851
and we'll let them decide who
they want to be their mentee.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.538
Okay, fine. Great.

14:32.681 --> 14:34.481
- Don't.
- What?

14:34.828 --> 14:36.944
It's my apartment,
I'm taking this cake out.

14:37.258 --> 14:38.559
You can't be trusted with cake.

14:38.606 --> 14:40.034
I can be trusted. It's my apartment.

14:40.059 --> 14:41.840
I'll decide who can be
trusted and who can't be.

14:41.865 --> 14:43.027
Give me the cake.

14:43.052 --> 14:45.768
- Absolutely not.
- You're gonna get dandruff on the cake.

14:45.793 --> 14:47.222
- I am not.
- Yes, sir!

14:47.247 --> 14:48.849
- Frenchy.
- Stop! -

14:48.930 --> 14:51.346
I don't mean to be intrusive,
but is this common,

14:51.371 --> 14:53.410
the way they compete for attention?

14:53.527 --> 14:55.025
This is nothing.

14:55.050 --> 14:57.380
Usually on game night, we
never get to the actual game.

14:57.405 --> 14:58.714
They just spend the whole evening

14:58.739 --> 15:01.108
screaming at each other
about the rules.

15:01.715 --> 15:04.744
It's actually a pretty good
metaphor for their relationship.

15:06.476 --> 15:10.189
Wow. Nice moves.

15:10.298 --> 15:11.498
Ballet for eight years.

15:11.705 --> 15:13.176
Broadway jazz for five.

15:13.214 --> 15:14.889
That might work as a wonderful way

15:14.914 --> 15:17.682
to non-verbally express what
you're feeling on the inside.

15:18.399 --> 15:20.199
You know what else is great?

15:20.294 --> 15:22.228
- Games.
- I love games.

15:22.282 --> 15:24.857
Especially something
with a performative element.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.617
No, no, no, we're not playing charades.

15:26.740 --> 15:28.078
She makes all the clues up,

15:28.103 --> 15:30.321
and unless you know a ton of stuff
about late '90s girl groups,

15:30.346 --> 15:31.551
you don't have a chance.

15:31.576 --> 15:33.983
I actually send out a Spotify
playlist ahead of time,

15:34.008 --> 15:36.383
so if you did your homework,
you wouldn't have a problem.

15:36.504 --> 15:38.705
All right, now it's
feeling like game night.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.894
Well, Benji, Esther, do you guys
like to be on the same team?

15:41.969 --> 15:44.671
Oh, they always play on the same team.

15:44.725 --> 15:46.502
It's been that way
since the day they met.

15:46.527 --> 15:47.882
Actually, I'd love to hear that story.

15:47.907 --> 15:49.874
- How did you guys meet?
- Yeah, how did you meet?

15:49.899 --> 15:50.910
Of course, yes.

15:50.935 --> 15:54.256
Um, I was at the Comedy Store
on stage doing stand-up

15:54.281 --> 15:56.458
at the open mic, and I heard

15:56.483 --> 15:59.488
this sharp, annoying,
almost painful voice

15:59.513 --> 16:01.087
coming from the back of the room.

16:01.112 --> 16:02.206
It was a heckler...

16:02.231 --> 16:04.794
I wasn't heckling.
Esther was on stage bombing,

16:04.819 --> 16:06.749
trying to do crowd work
by asking the audience

16:06.774 --> 16:08.942
what their favorite
Cheesecake Factory entree was,

16:08.967 --> 16:10.158
so I stepped in to save her...

16:10.183 --> 16:11.495
I didn't actually need to be saved,

16:11.520 --> 16:13.321
because I was doing just fine,

16:13.346 --> 16:14.646
and even if I was failing,

16:14.671 --> 16:16.571
failure is a part of the process.

16:16.711 --> 16:18.945
That's how you grow, that's
how you achieve, et cetera.

16:19.073 --> 16:21.443
Now Esther, how does it make you feel

16:21.468 --> 16:24.375
when Benji questions your
recollection of how you two met?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.677
Honestly, Rose,
it makes me feel terrible.

16:27.021 --> 16:28.751
It's weird that you feel terrible

16:28.776 --> 16:31.075
about certain things,
and not about other things,

16:31.185 --> 16:33.203
like, for example,
her Etsy account got flagged,

16:33.228 --> 16:35.994
'cause she was selling
unlicensed Heath Ledger merch.

16:36.049 --> 16:37.200
Whatever. You're just jealous

16:37.225 --> 16:38.749
that I was breastfed and you weren't.

16:38.786 --> 16:40.928
You think I'm the only
formula baby at this table?

16:40.953 --> 16:42.854
You don't know who you just offended.

16:42.879 --> 16:44.736
I think maybe we should
just take a breath.

16:44.761 --> 16:47.537
You're right, and here it is,
it's on full display.

16:47.562 --> 16:50.478
This is the reason
why I, moving forward,

16:50.503 --> 16:53.471
would love for you two
to be my mentors.

16:53.514 --> 16:56.264
By mentor, you mean
mental health professionals?

16:56.317 --> 16:58.118
Then sure, we can help you, no problem.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.173
No, I mean mentor,
like someone who looks at

17:00.198 --> 17:02.722
all the problems I'm having
and then fixes them for you.

17:02.876 --> 17:05.835
Yeah, we do that for a living.
We're psychologists.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.347
I'm sorry, you must've noticed that...

17:07.372 --> 17:09.404
The clients coming
in and out of our apartment.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.521
What are you talking about?

17:10.546 --> 17:12.076
I thought you just
had a lot of friends.

17:12.140 --> 17:13.915
No. We've actually been observing you

17:13.941 --> 17:15.576
since you moved into the building.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.603
It's interesting; we thought

17:17.690 --> 17:21.193
that you were probably
an emancipated minor,

17:21.327 --> 17:24.530
you know, because of
your dietary habits,

17:24.651 --> 17:26.163
and then, we thought, no,

17:26.188 --> 17:29.671
maybe it's Benji is keeping
you against your will

17:29.696 --> 17:31.704
as an indentured servant.

17:31.852 --> 17:34.043
I mean, how would I keep
someone against their will?

17:34.068 --> 17:35.379
I'm 125 pounds.

17:35.404 --> 17:36.789
We were wrong about that.

17:36.814 --> 17:39.272
After spending time
with you two this evening,

17:39.466 --> 17:42.769
this is clearly a textbook
case of codependency,

17:42.843 --> 17:45.363
and it's keeping you both from
reaching your full potential.

17:45.492 --> 17:48.261
Yes! Thank you!

17:48.488 --> 17:50.101
My fault. Sorry about that.

17:50.211 --> 17:52.741
- That was good. He's very healthy.
- Yes.

17:52.980 --> 17:54.331
It's the truth.

17:54.362 --> 17:56.779
So all of this was just
to drum up business

17:56.804 --> 17:58.372
for your practice? I mean,

17:58.679 --> 18:00.594
look around. She can't afford therapy.

18:00.619 --> 18:03.332
What kind of therapist
spies on potential patients?

18:03.357 --> 18:05.088
That sounds unethical to me.

18:05.113 --> 18:07.376
We weren't spying. You're
so obviously unwell,

18:07.401 --> 18:08.611
we couldn't help but notice.

18:08.636 --> 18:10.859
Thank you for
the groundbreaking diagnosis

18:10.884 --> 18:12.630
- that we're codependent.
- Really.

18:12.673 --> 18:16.452
You go to University of Phoenix?
We know we're codependent.

18:16.477 --> 18:19.445
I mean, we text each other every
time we have a bowel movement.

18:19.470 --> 18:21.196
Yeah. We FaceTime
every night before bed,

18:21.221 --> 18:22.996
and fall asleep to
each other's ambient noises.

18:23.021 --> 18:26.044
Ambient noises to fall asleep;
that is not normal, girl.

18:26.159 --> 18:28.427
I think you two should
just have sex with each other,

18:28.452 --> 18:29.510
and call it a day.

18:29.535 --> 18:31.913
Wow, what a revolution. Yeah, we know.

18:31.938 --> 18:33.837
You think you're
the first person to say that?

18:33.862 --> 18:37.286
Suggesting we have sex is the
most hack thing to say to us

18:37.311 --> 18:39.111
right after "you're codependent."

18:39.136 --> 18:40.749
Okay. You know what?

18:40.774 --> 18:42.831
We didn't come here
to drum up business.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.241
We don't need your business.

18:44.266 --> 18:46.420
We came here to have a nice
dinner with our neighbors.

18:46.445 --> 18:48.279
But I think it's time to leave, honey.

18:48.304 --> 18:50.573
- Yeah, I do.
- I think that's a great idea.

18:50.598 --> 18:52.668
I think you should just go.
Go. Please go.

18:52.693 --> 18:54.060
We'll just show ourselves out.

18:54.085 --> 18:55.720
Please show yourselves out
and go, I think that's great.

18:55.745 --> 18:58.146
I'm so sorry. I've been
in therapy for ten years.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.907
I want you to know, I'm on your side.

18:59.932 --> 19:02.248
It's just, I gotta stay for cake.

19:02.273 --> 19:04.513
Wait, before you go, can I ask
you one question for free?

19:04.538 --> 19:07.107
How do you guys
smell so good all the time?

19:07.220 --> 19:08.520
Is it a shower? What is it?

19:08.582 --> 19:10.316
Small-batch lavender oil.

19:10.772 --> 19:12.595
Very expensive.

19:12.900 --> 19:15.088
Thank you. Get out!

19:18.217 --> 19:20.996
- The jitterbug.
- Uh, ten-meter sprint.

19:21.050 --> 19:22.423
- <i>Wayne's World</i> flashback.
- Jay-walking ticket.

19:22.448 --> 19:23.476
Flashback.

19:23.501 --> 19:25.424
"Don't Go Chasing Waterfalls."

19:25.513 --> 19:26.680
'90s girl groups.

19:27.024 --> 19:28.972
Always remember the category.

19:28.997 --> 19:32.426
I'm sorry. Now that
you say that, you were nailing it.

19:32.451 --> 19:34.270
- I know.
- I just missed it.

19:34.295 --> 19:36.563
Okay, I'm up.

19:38.933 --> 19:40.134
No.

19:42.483 --> 19:44.311
Esther, I don't know
what any of these things are.

19:44.342 --> 19:49.511
I mean, what is "No More"?

19:49.539 --> 19:52.552
3LW. Dude, did you have no childhood?

19:52.732 --> 19:54.943
- What's going on?
- Making games only you can win?

19:54.978 --> 19:56.406
What are you, Angelica from <i>Rugrats?</i>

19:56.431 --> 19:58.499
You guys, if you're not
doing the right research

19:58.524 --> 20:00.158
before you play the game,
that's on you.

20:00.183 --> 20:01.520
Where did you get this cake?

20:01.558 --> 20:04.361
It's actually three old cakes
pushed into one cake,

20:04.386 --> 20:06.588
and one of them is from
my half-birthday party,

20:06.623 --> 20:08.991
which I'm still waiting
on my presents, guys.

20:09.025 --> 20:10.761
So this cake's from three months ago?

20:10.786 --> 20:13.145
When you push all the cakes
together, it's like recycling.

20:13.279 --> 20:14.474
It was in the freezer, okay?

20:14.499 --> 20:16.033
The icing is brand-new.

20:16.058 --> 20:19.375
All right, I'm out.
See you guys next week.

20:19.524 --> 20:21.124
- What?
- What's next week?

20:21.835 --> 20:22.971
You guys suck.

20:23.998 --> 20:25.857
- So negative.
- I know.
