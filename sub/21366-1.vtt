02:38.940 --> 02:40.890
English! I'm English!

05:40.070 --> 05:41.680
It's grenadiers, mate.

05:55.210 --> 05:56.970
Make way!

06:00.800 --> 06:02.600
Out of the way!

06:02.600 --> 06:04.470
Go, go, go!

06:04.470 --> 06:06.260
Along the mole. All the way.

06:06.260 --> 06:08.010
The ship's about to leave.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.870
Along the mole. All the way.
The ship's about to leave.

07:45.660 --> 07:47.660
Where's the bloody air force?

08:34.770 --> 08:37.270
The navy's requisitioned her.

08:37.270 --> 08:40.400
They'll be back in an hour. My
dad wants to be ready before then.

08:42.549 --> 08:45.420
They've told us to strip her
and load those life jackets.

08:45.430 --> 08:48.590
Some men across the Channel,
at Dunkirk, need taking off.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.640
Some men?

09:09.830 --> 09:11.910
Check fuel, Fortis 1 and 2.

09:16.170 --> 09:17.390
70 gallons.

09:19.540 --> 09:21.710
68 gallons, Fortis Leader.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.840
Stay down at 500 feet to leave fuel

09:24.840 --> 09:27.510
for 40-minute fighting
time over Dunkirk.

09:28.490 --> 09:31.410
Understood. Vector
128, angels point five.

09:31.410 --> 09:34.640
And keep an eye on that gauge,
even when it gets lively.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.560
Save enough to get back.

10:45.170 --> 10:48.990
No French soldiers.
No French soldiers. No.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.760
No, no French. English only.
English only past this point.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.350
No. It's a British ship.
No, you have your own ships.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.100
Get back. Get back.

10:57.100 --> 10:59.390
No, you've got your own
ships. This is a British ship.

10:59.390 --> 11:00.890
No, get back.

11:00.900 --> 11:03.130
Look, get the stretchers through.
There are stretchers coming.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.110
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

11:05.110 --> 11:08.230
Go, go, go. Along the mole. All the way.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.580
The ship's about to
leave. About to leave.

11:10.580 --> 11:12.030
Along the mole. All the way.

11:12.030 --> 11:14.530
Along the mole. Along the
mole. All the way. All the way.

11:14.530 --> 11:15.700
No.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.490
No, English only. English only!

11:21.460 --> 11:22.560
No!

11:37.850 --> 11:39.390
Ready on the stern!

11:39.390 --> 11:40.390
Yes, sir!

11:51.700 --> 11:53.320
Man the bowline!

11:53.320 --> 11:54.740
Any more room?

12:02.010 --> 12:04.160
You have to get back!

12:11.800 --> 12:13.470
That's two minutes.

12:13.470 --> 12:15.630
You've missed it. You've missed it.

12:43.710 --> 12:45.210
Is that the last one?

12:45.210 --> 12:46.290
Aye, sir.

12:49.210 --> 12:50.630
Break the line.

12:54.050 --> 12:55.430
Come on! Come on!

13:51.820 --> 13:54.530
Dunkirk's so far. Why can't
they just load at Calais?

13:54.530 --> 13:57.030
The enemy had something to say about it.

13:58.950 --> 14:01.720
Ah, down here we're sitting ducks.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.350
Keep 'em peeled. They'll
come out of the sun.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.390
Up the line.

14:20.550 --> 14:22.430
Oi. We'll take it.

14:24.770 --> 14:26.350
Drop the gangplank!

14:26.350 --> 14:27.350
Yes, sir!

14:44.310 --> 14:45.790
Take a run at it.

15:15.650 --> 15:17.570
Ready on the stern line, George.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.750
Aren't you waiting on the navy?

15:21.750 --> 15:24.200
They've asked for the
Moonstone, they'll have her.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.570
And her captain.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.750
And his son.

15:30.370 --> 15:31.910
Thanks for the help, George.

15:35.540 --> 15:37.210
What are you doing?

15:37.210 --> 15:38.410
You do know where we're going?

15:40.220 --> 15:41.290
France.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.180
Into war, George.

15:45.220 --> 15:46.430
I'll be useful, sir.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.480
Bandit, 11 o'clock.

15:57.480 --> 15:58.690
Break.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.250
He's on me.

16:15.630 --> 16:16.920
I'm on him.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.290
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

16:55.290 --> 16:56.500
Oi, you two.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.840
Get a shift on.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.550
Yeah, pull him tight. Tie a knot in it.

17:02.550 --> 17:04.630
Back up the line. Both of you.

17:04.630 --> 17:06.220
Off you go.

17:06.220 --> 17:07.550
Off you go!

17:07.550 --> 17:10.220
That last barrage has
damaged the rudder.

17:10.220 --> 17:11.420
Uh, okay...

17:11.430 --> 17:13.089
Psst!

17:49.800 --> 17:50.970
Mr. Dawson!

17:50.970 --> 17:52.350
One of ours, George.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.950
On my mark, Fortis 2. Draw him left.

19:06.430 --> 19:09.170
Three, two, one.

19:09.170 --> 19:10.220
Mark.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.570
Clear.

19:28.990 --> 19:30.700
Is he down?

19:39.060 --> 19:40.620
Yeah, he's down for the count.

19:47.050 --> 19:49.100
Fortis Leader, one bandit down.

19:53.180 --> 19:54.850
Fortis Leader, do you read?

20:00.520 --> 20:04.480
Fortis 2, I have you to my port. I
have no eyes on Fortis Leader. Over.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.650
Understood, Fortis 1.

20:06.650 --> 20:08.070
Orbit for a look.

20:20.910 --> 20:22.330
How long, Lieutenant?

20:22.330 --> 20:25.370
We need to run a new cable,
sir. They're scrambling.

20:25.370 --> 20:26.670
Very well.

20:31.670 --> 20:34.760
Colonel, you're gonna have to decide
how many more wounded to evacuate.

20:34.760 --> 20:37.510
One stretcher takes the
space of seven standing men.

20:37.510 --> 20:38.600
Excuse me.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.100
- Rear Admiral.
- Commander.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.870
How's the perimeter?

20:58.870 --> 21:00.830
Shrinking every day.

21:00.830 --> 21:04.120
But between our rear guard and
the French, we're holding the line.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.120
And the enemy tanks have stopped.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.640
Why have they stopped?

21:07.650 --> 21:08.980
Waste precious tanks

21:08.980 --> 21:11.290
when they can pick us off from
the air, like fish in a barrel?

21:11.300 --> 21:12.970
How long does London expect the army

21:12.970 --> 21:14.510
to hold out before we make terms?

21:14.510 --> 21:15.510
Make terms?

21:16.180 --> 21:20.100
They're not stopping here.
We need to get our army back.

21:20.100 --> 21:22.970
Britain's next and then
the rest of the world.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.060
Christ.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.560
I mean, you can practically
see it from here.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.690
What?

21:29.610 --> 21:30.860
Home.

21:31.940 --> 21:33.090
What about the French?

21:33.090 --> 21:36.240
Publicly, Churchill's
told them, "Bras dessous."

21:36.240 --> 21:38.170
Arm in arm, leaving together.

21:38.170 --> 21:39.550
And privately?

21:39.550 --> 21:41.910
We need our army back.

21:41.910 --> 21:43.950
How many men are they
talking about, sir?

21:44.610 --> 21:48.360
Churchill wants 30,000. Ramsay's
hoping we can give him 45.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.430
There are 400,000 men
on this beach, sir.

21:53.260 --> 21:55.380
We'll just have to do our best.

21:56.550 --> 21:59.090
Right, well, this mole
stays open at all costs.

22:00.300 --> 22:04.420
We're in artillery range from the
west. If anything else sinks here,

22:04.430 --> 22:06.600
the mole's blocked and we're stuffed.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.140
Can't we load from the beaches?

22:08.150 --> 22:10.020
Better than standing out
here when the dive bombs come.

22:10.020 --> 22:11.560
- It's impossible.
- Too shallow?

22:11.570 --> 22:13.610
'Cause anything that drafts
over three feet can't get near.

22:13.610 --> 22:17.240
We don't have enough small boats
to ferry men to the destroyers.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.120
The mole it is, then, gentlemen.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.620
Hey!

23:11.580 --> 23:13.750
Hey! Can you swim it?

23:15.800 --> 23:17.500
Dad, can you get closer?

23:17.510 --> 23:18.970
Can't risk it!

23:20.570 --> 23:21.760
Hang on.

24:11.350 --> 24:12.600
What's your name?

24:31.870 --> 24:33.120
Wreckage below.

24:34.330 --> 24:36.250
Is it more of the 109?

24:36.250 --> 24:37.710
No.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.380
It's Fortis Leader. Over.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.090
You think he got out?

24:42.090 --> 24:43.530
I didn't see a 'chute.

24:44.890 --> 24:47.010
Record his position.

24:47.010 --> 24:49.390
Then set heading 128,

24:49.390 --> 24:51.430
height 1,000. Over.

24:51.430 --> 24:53.690
Vector 128, angels one. Understood.

24:59.570 --> 25:00.900
Fortis 2, what's your fuel?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.900
50 gallons. Over.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.650
50 gallons.

25:09.870 --> 25:11.950
All right, keep letting me know.

25:11.950 --> 25:13.750
My gauge took a bit
of a knock back there.

25:15.330 --> 25:17.000
Shouldn't you turn back?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.500
No, no.

25:19.130 --> 25:21.500
I'm fairly confident
it's just the gauge.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.930
- She's going down!
- Cut her loose!

26:52.930 --> 26:54.100
What about the wounded?

26:55.310 --> 26:57.680
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

27:00.060 --> 27:01.690
Cut her loose, and push her off!

27:01.690 --> 27:03.440
We can't let her sink at the mole!

27:04.150 --> 27:05.980
Push the bloody boat off!

27:13.450 --> 27:14.450
Help us!

28:27.770 --> 28:29.820
Do you want to come below?

28:29.820 --> 28:31.740
It's much warmer.

28:32.650 --> 28:33.990
It's out of the wind.

28:33.990 --> 28:35.410
Here you go.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.870
Leave him be, George.

28:39.870 --> 28:41.700
He feels safer on deck.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.460
You would too if you'd been bombed.

28:44.460 --> 28:45.460
U-boat.

28:47.790 --> 28:49.960
It was a U-boat.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.180
Get him some more tea, George.

29:10.190 --> 29:12.650
Right, we're about five minutes out,

29:12.650 --> 29:14.490
so climb to 2,000. Over.

29:14.490 --> 29:15.560
That's more fuel.

29:15.560 --> 29:17.270
I know, but I don't
want to get jumped again.

29:17.280 --> 29:18.660
Let's get a decent altitude.

29:18.660 --> 29:20.740
We can dive down on the
bastards from above. Over.

29:20.740 --> 29:22.370
Understood. Angels two.

29:22.370 --> 29:23.370
Over.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.460
Right, Highlanders.

29:27.460 --> 29:29.040
Let's find you another ship.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.160
Come on.

30:45.160 --> 30:48.290
Everyone else, keep
climbing. Climb on the deck.

30:48.290 --> 30:51.540
Climb on the deck.

30:51.540 --> 30:53.590
Watch your heads on the rail. Watch it.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.300
That's right, keep going
down. Take a blanket.

30:57.300 --> 30:59.220
Down you go. Put this on, my love.

30:59.220 --> 31:02.260
Down you go. Keep going down.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.550
There's a nice cup of
tea for you down there.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.720
Keep moving down.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.390
Take a blanket.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.770
Try and make some room.

31:09.770 --> 31:11.190
Keep moving down, boys.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.610
This way.

31:14.730 --> 31:16.570
A cup of tea down there.

31:41.050 --> 31:44.010
There you go. Down
there. Move down there.

32:02.970 --> 32:04.700
What's wrong with your friend?

32:24.050 --> 32:25.370
He's looking for a quick way out.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.140
In case we go down.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.260
Where are we going?

33:09.260 --> 33:10.770
Dunkirk.

33:12.810 --> 33:14.890
No, uh, no, no, we're going to England.

33:16.600 --> 33:19.150
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

33:19.150 --> 33:22.020
Look, I'm not going back.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.900
I'm not going back.

33:25.860 --> 33:27.160
Look at it.

33:28.410 --> 33:30.030
If we go there, we'll die.

33:37.210 --> 33:38.210
I see your point, son.

33:39.090 --> 33:41.170
Well, let's plot a course.

33:44.510 --> 33:47.180
You can take your tea below and warm up.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.470
Peter, have we got space
for a man to lie down?

33:52.470 --> 33:53.890
Uh, yeah.

33:59.310 --> 34:00.690
Here, come on.

34:06.070 --> 34:07.070
Careful.

34:09.489 --> 34:10.659
Careful.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.290
Just in there.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.500
I'll get you some more tea.

34:37.270 --> 34:38.980
Is he a coward, Mr. Dawson?

34:38.980 --> 34:40.770
He's shell-shocked, George.

34:40.770 --> 34:42.360
He's not himself.

34:45.110 --> 34:47.489
He may never be himself again.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.250
Here you are.

35:14.810 --> 35:16.720
40 gallons, Fortis 1.

35:18.270 --> 35:19.390
40 gallons, understood.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.440
Heinkel, 11 o'clock.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.530
She's lining up to drop her
load on that minesweeper.

35:28.530 --> 35:29.690
Fighters?

35:29.700 --> 35:32.160
Yeah, 109s off her starboard.

35:33.240 --> 35:34.700
I'm on the bomber.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.500
Got him! Got him!

36:59.870 --> 37:02.040
Oh, she's turning. You
must've damaged her.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.410
Where's the escort?

37:03.410 --> 37:04.580
Well, I got one of...

37:05.250 --> 37:06.250
Jesus!

37:25.060 --> 37:26.480
I'm going down.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.020
I'm on him. Bail out.

37:48.210 --> 37:49.770
No, the swell looks good. I'm ditching.

38:10.610 --> 38:11.860
Don't leave us!

38:12.780 --> 38:14.900
Come back!

38:14.900 --> 38:17.410
- Wait for us!
- Help! Help us!

38:20.240 --> 38:23.660
Pick us up! Pick us up!

38:27.370 --> 38:29.080
Come back!

38:30.580 --> 38:31.790
Torpedo!

39:03.080 --> 39:07.290
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

40:53.560 --> 40:54.940
Help!

40:54.940 --> 40:56.610
Get us out of here!

41:11.330 --> 41:12.790
Spitfires, George.

41:12.790 --> 41:15.120
Greatest plane ever built.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.120
You didn't even look.

41:21.340 --> 41:23.300
Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.

41:24.130 --> 41:27.340
Sweetest sound you could hear out here.

41:28.140 --> 41:29.140
Hello?

41:30.810 --> 41:32.970
Could you open the door?

41:32.980 --> 41:34.520
Hello? Can you hear me?

41:36.060 --> 41:38.770
Open the door!

41:38.770 --> 41:40.150
Do you hear me?

41:42.480 --> 41:43.940
He wants to come out.

41:43.940 --> 41:46.110
What have you done? Locked him in?

41:46.110 --> 41:47.780
Let him out, for God's sake.

41:47.780 --> 41:48.780
Hello?

41:50.740 --> 41:52.410
Let me out!

42:06.930 --> 42:09.550
You haven't turned around.

42:11.970 --> 42:13.770
No. We have a job to do.

42:15.140 --> 42:18.480
Job? This is a pleasure yacht.

42:18.480 --> 42:21.270
You're weekend sailors,
not the bloody navy.

42:21.940 --> 42:24.020
A man your age?

42:24.030 --> 42:26.650
Men my age dictate this war.

42:26.650 --> 42:29.530
Why should we be allowed to
send our children to fight it?

42:29.530 --> 42:31.370
You should be at home!

42:31.370 --> 42:33.150
Well, there won't be any home if we

42:33.160 --> 42:35.040
allow a slaughter across the Channel.

42:42.090 --> 42:44.130
He's turning tail. I'm
gonna get after him.

42:45.710 --> 42:46.880
Good luck.

42:46.880 --> 42:49.890
Watch your fuel. You're at 15 gallons.

42:52.510 --> 42:53.970
15 gallons, understood.

42:56.060 --> 42:57.640
Best of luck, Collins.

43:00.690 --> 43:02.860
Collins, do you read?

44:04.670 --> 44:07.000
Oi! No! No!

44:07.000 --> 44:09.250
Get off! Get off!

44:09.260 --> 44:11.260
Piss off, the both of
you. It's too crowded.

44:11.260 --> 44:12.510
You can't leave us!

44:13.590 --> 44:14.800
Make some room!

44:14.800 --> 44:15.800
No!

44:16.720 --> 44:18.180
No! Get off!

44:18.180 --> 44:20.000
You men, leave off.
You'll capsize the boat.

44:20.010 --> 44:21.910
She's gone over twice
on the way out here.

44:21.920 --> 44:24.070
You have to stay calm.
There are plenty of boats.

44:24.070 --> 44:25.020
Calm?

44:25.020 --> 44:27.810
Wait till you get torpedoed,
then tell us to be calm!

44:27.820 --> 44:29.270
You have life jackets?

44:29.280 --> 44:30.780
Yes, they do.

44:30.780 --> 44:32.900
Don't panic, boys. The
water's not too rough

44:32.910 --> 44:34.150
or too cold.

44:34.160 --> 44:35.860
We're heading back to the beach.

44:35.870 --> 44:38.120
- Let's go to Dover!
- Yeah!

44:38.870 --> 44:40.840
We can't make it across
the Channel in this, lads.

44:40.840 --> 44:44.170
We need to get back to the
beach and wait for another ride.

44:44.170 --> 44:47.460
You men in the water, float
here, save your strength.

44:47.460 --> 44:49.170
We'll come back for you.

44:49.170 --> 44:50.170
Oars in!

44:51.300 --> 44:54.010
Together, pull!

44:55.260 --> 44:57.550
Together, pull!

44:59.890 --> 45:00.890
Pull!

45:01.930 --> 45:04.100
Together, pull!

45:06.310 --> 45:07.360
Pull!

45:08.940 --> 45:11.400
Together, pull!

45:14.660 --> 45:16.820
There's no hiding from this, son.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.990
What is it you think you can
do out there, on this thing?

45:22.000 --> 45:25.290
There's not just us. A call went out.

45:25.290 --> 45:27.500
We aren't the only ones
to answer, you know.

45:27.500 --> 45:29.540
You don't even have guns.

45:29.550 --> 45:30.710
Do you have a gun?

45:30.710 --> 45:33.630
Yes, of course. A rifle, a 303.

45:33.630 --> 45:36.680
Did it help you against the
dive bombers and the U-boats?

45:37.890 --> 45:39.560
You're an old fool.

45:40.760 --> 45:44.440
I'm not going back.

45:45.140 --> 45:46.150
Turn it around.

45:47.230 --> 45:48.650
I'm not turning round.

45:49.310 --> 45:50.480
Turn it around!

45:52.230 --> 45:54.030
Turn it...

45:55.220 --> 45:57.070
- Calm it down, mate.
- Turn it around!

45:57.070 --> 45:58.240
Wait, wait!

45:58.240 --> 45:59.950
Calm it down, mate.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.120
George?

46:02.950 --> 46:03.950
George!

46:06.750 --> 46:07.870
What have you done?

46:09.460 --> 46:10.920
Okay, you're all right, George.

46:11.670 --> 46:12.840
You're all right.

46:13.550 --> 46:16.720
Hang on. Okay. Okay, just...

46:16.720 --> 46:18.380
That's it. That's good enough.

46:18.390 --> 46:21.470
It's gonna keep some
pressure on. There we go.

46:21.470 --> 46:23.220
There we go.

46:23.220 --> 46:24.480
Can you hear me, George?

48:59.050 --> 49:00.590
Come on, lads!

49:01.800 --> 49:04.640
Come on! Come on, boys!

51:10.140 --> 51:11.300
It's a pier.

51:12.390 --> 51:13.970
For when the water comes in.

51:18.520 --> 51:19.900
The tide's turning now.

51:21.980 --> 51:22.980
How can you tell?

51:25.440 --> 51:26.900
The bodies come back.

51:57.720 --> 51:58.730
Hey.

52:11.070 --> 52:12.740
Hey, Highlanders!

52:22.670 --> 52:24.500
Hey, Highlanders!

52:24.500 --> 52:25.710
What's that way?

52:26.340 --> 52:27.540
A boat.

52:27.550 --> 52:29.090
She's grounded.

52:29.090 --> 52:31.170
Not when the tide comes in, she's not.

52:48.440 --> 52:51.070
Be a brave lad.

52:53.460 --> 52:55.070
You and Mr. Dawson?

52:57.160 --> 52:58.560
It's the best thing I've ever done.

52:59.330 --> 53:01.750
You're all right. You're okay.

53:12.560 --> 53:15.670
Sea Cadet. It's the only
thing I've ever done.

53:15.670 --> 53:17.840
It's all right. It's
okay. Just have some water.

53:20.470 --> 53:22.310
I told my dad...

53:22.310 --> 53:24.480
I've done nothing at school

53:26.400 --> 53:28.570
and that I would do something one day.

53:31.360 --> 53:34.070
Maybe get in the local paper.

53:34.070 --> 53:36.450
Maybe my teachers would see it.

53:36.450 --> 53:37.990
Okay, get some rest.

53:37.990 --> 53:40.530
I need you back up on deck
as soon as you're able.

53:42.450 --> 53:43.460
I can't.

53:44.160 --> 53:45.410
What?

53:49.630 --> 53:50.960
I can't see.

54:50.900 --> 54:51.900
Sir.

54:53.230 --> 54:55.690
The French have been forced
back on the western side.

54:56.610 --> 54:58.110
They're still holding a perimeter?

54:58.110 --> 54:59.110
For now.

55:00.700 --> 55:02.940
Officer coming through. Move
yourselves. Move yourselves!

55:13.320 --> 55:14.820
Where are the destroyers?

55:14.830 --> 55:16.370
There'll be one soon.

55:19.930 --> 55:21.050
One?

55:21.050 --> 55:23.800
After yesterday's losses, it's
one ship on the mole at a time.

55:23.810 --> 55:25.050
The battle is here.

55:25.060 --> 55:26.720
What the hell are they saving them for?

55:26.730 --> 55:28.350
The next battle.

55:28.350 --> 55:29.980
The one for Britain.

55:29.980 --> 55:31.940
It's the same with the planes.

55:34.070 --> 55:35.690
But it's right there.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.570
You can practically...

55:37.570 --> 55:39.780
Seeing home doesn't help
us get there, Colonel.

55:39.780 --> 55:41.740
They need to send more ships.

55:42.660 --> 55:44.240
Every hour the enemy pushes closer.

55:45.080 --> 55:47.080
They've activated the
small vessels pool.

55:48.040 --> 55:49.200
Small vessels?

55:49.210 --> 55:52.170
It's the list of civilian
boats for requisition.

55:52.170 --> 55:53.170
Civilian?

55:55.000 --> 55:56.920
We need destroyers.

55:56.920 --> 55:58.840
Small boats can load from the beach.

55:58.840 --> 56:00.260
Not in these conditions.

56:00.260 --> 56:02.760
Well, I'd rather face
waves than dive bombers.

56:05.720 --> 56:08.480
No, you're right. They
won't get up in this.

56:09.810 --> 56:12.770
The Royal Engineers are
building piers from lorries.

56:12.770 --> 56:15.560
At least that should help
us when the tide comes back.

56:15.570 --> 56:17.730
Well, we'll know in six hours' time.

56:18.740 --> 56:20.220
I thought the tides were every three?

56:21.990 --> 56:24.780
Then it's good that you're
army and I'm navy, isn't it?

56:26.240 --> 56:28.540
There. Vanquisher.

56:43.340 --> 56:44.720
Where's the crew?

56:44.720 --> 56:47.390
Probably got spooked
after they ran aground.

56:47.390 --> 56:49.390
Scarpered up the beach.

56:49.390 --> 56:50.560
Why?

56:50.560 --> 56:53.770
'Cause we're outside the perimeter.
Enemy could be right there.

56:54.940 --> 56:57.520
All right, best shut
ourselves inside, boys.

56:57.520 --> 56:58.690
Wait for the high tide.

56:58.690 --> 57:00.440
How long's that?

57:00.440 --> 57:02.070
Every three hours.

57:25.640 --> 57:27.890
I've put a bit of pressure on it.

57:27.890 --> 57:29.850
Strapped him up, made him comfortable.

57:31.100 --> 57:32.180
What?

57:34.440 --> 57:35.440
It's bad, Dad.

57:38.440 --> 57:39.940
Well, should we turn back?

57:46.320 --> 57:47.320
We've come so far.

57:48.700 --> 57:50.200
Dad, is that one of ours?

57:51.740 --> 57:55.200
That's a Heinkel. They'll go
for that minesweeper there.

57:55.200 --> 57:57.500
Hang on. Shouldn't we stand
by to pick up survivors?

57:57.500 --> 57:59.380
To do that we have to survive ourselves.

58:04.130 --> 58:06.300
Poke your head out. See
if the water's come in.

58:11.760 --> 58:13.270
Talkative sod, aren't you?

58:39.380 --> 58:41.330
It's barely come in at all.

58:41.340 --> 58:43.670
- Fuck's sake.
- Calm down.

58:43.670 --> 58:46.010
What goes out comes
back in again, right?

58:46.010 --> 58:47.430
Yeah, but how long?

59:04.030 --> 59:05.030
Spitfires!

59:05.900 --> 59:06.950
Come on.

59:13.580 --> 59:14.620
Come on, come on.

59:23.380 --> 59:24.880
Dad, he got him!

59:24.880 --> 59:26.460
Yeah! Yeah!

59:33.810 --> 59:35.350
The Heinkel's moving off.

59:40.480 --> 59:41.480
Yeah.

59:43.110 --> 59:44.110
Oh, no.

59:46.070 --> 59:47.860
Smoke from the Spitfire!

59:49.200 --> 59:51.030
Watch for a parachute!

59:57.870 --> 59:59.070
Oi.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.550
Oi. Oi.

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.090
Are you German?

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:54.550
No, Dutch. Dutch!

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.010
Merchant navy.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.310
Here to pick you up. To help you.

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:01.140
Why'd you leave your boat?

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.390
In case the Germans come.

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.840
We wait up the beach.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.060
With the soldiers. Wait for the tide.

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:09.360
You came back. The tide must be in.

01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:12.690
Coming. Coming, yes.

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.860
But more hours till we float.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.030
Hours?

01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:17.620
Why'd you come back?

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:20.580
Not so heavy when I left.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.430
No 'chute!

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:42.110
Best of luck, Collins.

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.900
Collins, do you read?

01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:16.050
He's down.

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.340
Dad.

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:01.550
Dad, watch the engine.

01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:04.890
Dad, he's down. There was no 'chute.

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:10.770
Dad, come on. There was no 'chute.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.690
He's probably dead.

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:14.860
Damn it, I hear you, Peter! I hear you!

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.910
He may be alive. Maybe.

01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:23.780
We may be able to help him.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:19.800
No! Then they'll know we're in here.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.800
Why else are they shooting at us?

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.340
Look at the grouping.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.640
Target practice.

01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:33.290
Go. Plug it. Go, go.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.980
We have to plug it.

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.190
After you, mate.

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:20.210
You ready? Go!

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.800
How do we get off? Do we
need to ditch some ballast?

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.760
Weight! Do we need to lose weight?

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.680
Weight. Weight, yes.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.180
Yes.

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.560
Somebody needs to get off.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.180
Well volunteered.

01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:39.190
We don't need a volunteer.

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:40.820
I know someone who ought to get off.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.280
This one.

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:47.070
He's a German spy.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.610
Don't be daft.

01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:50.160
He's a fucking Jerry.

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:53.120
Have you noticed he hasn't said a word?

01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:56.000
'Cause I have.

01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:58.040
He don't speak English.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:01.380
If he does it's with an accent
that's thicker than sauerkraut sauce.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.630
You're daft. Tell him.

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:04.840
Yeah.

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.640
Tell me.

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:37.000
Tell me, Gibson.

01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:46.050
Tell me!

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:48.630
Tell him, for God's sake!

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.560
A frog.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.100
A bloody frog.

01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:04.940
A cowardly little queue-jumping frog.

01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:07.150
Who's Gibson, eh?

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:09.640
Some naked, dead Englishman
lying out on that sand?

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.530
Did you at least have
the decency to bury him?

01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:13.680
He did. I helped him. I
thought it was his mate.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.410
- Maybe he killed him.
- He didn't kill him.

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:16.580
How do we know?

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:19.160
How hard is it to find a dead
Englishman on Dunkirk beach?

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.580
He didn't kill anyone.

01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:23.100
He was just looking for a way
off the sand, like the rest of us.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.050
Haven't they had enough practice by now?

01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:32.220
They're trying to make
sure she won't float.

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:33.880
Will she still float?

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:35.680
Float, yes. Yes, with less weight.

01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:38.560
And we know who's getting off.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.850
No, you can't do that. He's
French. He's on our side.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.520
Go on. Up you go.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.939
As soon as he pokes his head
out, they'll slaughter him.

01:08:44.939 --> 01:08:46.359
Better him than me.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:47.689
It's not fair.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:49.149
Survival's not fair.

01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:50.270
No, it's shit.

01:08:51.029 --> 01:08:53.529
It's fear, and it's greed.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.700
Fate pushed through the bowels of men.

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:56.700
Shit.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.620
He saved our lives.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.040
And he's about to do it again.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.160
No, don't! Stop!

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:06.790
Somebody's gotta get off,
so the rest of us can live.

01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:08.750
If you wanna volunteer...

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:10.170
Fuck no.

01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:11.170
I'm going home.

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:13.510
And if this is the price?

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:19.640
I'll live with it.

01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:21.270
But it's wrong.

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.060
Go on!

01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:27.310
One man's not going to
make enough difference.

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:29.670
You'd best hope it does, because
you'd be volunteering next.

01:09:30.569 --> 01:09:31.569
What?

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:34.319
We're regimental brothers, mate.

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:36.319
It's just the way it is.

01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:47.710
We float!

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:49.550
We float!

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:51.840
Start the bloody engine!

01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:31.630
Afternoon.

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:29.350
I'm sorry, son. I really don't know.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:33.770
You're right not moving him.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.860
You've done the best for him you can.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.290
We've wasted the day.

01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:54.340
I share your frustration, Colonel.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.880
Johnny!

01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:05.930
Grounded trawler, taking fire.

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:07.980
They're breaking through
the dunes to the east.

01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:13.190
This is it.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.530
Plug the holes!

01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:23.820
With what?

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.630
Plug the holes!

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:41.180
Other side! Other side!

01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:32.430
What do you see?

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.650
Home.

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:37.230
Is he all right? The boy?

01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:40.640
No.

01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:42.310
No, he's not.

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:54.740
Dad!

01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:04.920
Come on. Come on, Farrier. Come on.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.480
There's men in the water!

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:11.820
Oil.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.780
It's oil. Oil. You're getting into oil!

01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:52.690
Keep coming.

01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:55.110
Plenty of room.

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.870
All right, below deck.

01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:39.830
Abandon ship!

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:04.390
Gibson! Leave it!

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:48.560
Below decks.

01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:39.820
Listen, we have to get as
many of you on board as we can

01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:41.110
before that oil catches fire.

01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:43.740
You go below decks or you get
off my boat. That's your choice.

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:48.410
Keep coming.

01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:52.410
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Careful!
Careful down there!

01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:53.710
Careful! Careful down there!

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:57.880
He's dead, mate.

01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:04.590
So be bloody careful with him.

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:28.290
Um, will he be okay?

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.120
The boy?

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.090
Yeah.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:02.590
He's coming back round.

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:05.250
He's coming back round!

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.560
Come on, Farrier. Come on.

01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.360
Get off the ship!

01:23:45.210 --> 01:23:46.840
Come on, Farrier. Get around them.

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.130
Come on, come on.

01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:45.820
Go.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.320
Go! Go! Go!

01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:06.800
Go!

01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:41.580
Easy.

01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:47.960
Take me home.

01:26:45.850 --> 01:26:47.150
Where are you from?

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:50.020
Out of Dartmouth!

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:51.270
Christ.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.860
You from Deal?

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.480
I am!

01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:57.820
You watch the current at the mouth!

01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:58.990
Aye.

01:26:58.990 --> 01:27:00.070
And thank you!

01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:51.080
That's a fighter.

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.420
Yes, an Me 109.

01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.590
From the south. Peter,
you take the tiller.

01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:56.420
Listen for my instructions.

01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:58.470
Point her south!

01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:12.110
Full speed, Peter.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.150
Keep coming round.

01:28:16.150 --> 01:28:17.360
Keep coming.

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:22.370
Before he fires, he's gotta drop
his nose. I'll give you the signal.

01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:25.080
- Now?
- No, no. Wait.

01:28:26.290 --> 01:28:28.330
Wait for him to commit to his line.

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.600
Now!

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:25.930
He's gone.

01:29:25.930 --> 01:29:27.430
Yeah, bigger fish to fry.

01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:29.720
How'd you know that stuff, anyway?

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:30.930
My son's one of you lot.

01:29:31.730 --> 01:29:33.440
I knew he'd see us through.

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.490
You're RAF?

01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:44.570
No. Not me.

01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:48.070
My brother. He flew Hurricanes.

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.660
Died third week into the war.

01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:31.990
No, stay downstairs, please.

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:34.620
We just wanna see the cliffs.

01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:44.050
- Is it Dover?
- No.

01:30:44.050 --> 01:30:46.050
That's Dorset.

01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:47.590
But it's home.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:52.060
We let you all down, didn't we?

01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:34.270
Christ, how many you got in there?

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.910
Make your way to the trains.

01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:57.160
Where the hell were you?

01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:06.300
They know where you were.

01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:12.550
Bye.

01:32:32.370 --> 01:32:33.740
Cup of tea?

01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:37.040
Cup of tea?

01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:41.040
Well done. Well done.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.330
Well done, lads.

01:32:42.330 --> 01:32:44.740
Well done. Well done, lads.

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.060
Well done.

01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:49.730
All we did is survive.

01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:51.840
That's enough.

01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:00.800
Well done.

01:33:01.730 --> 01:33:03.020
Well done.

01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:16.690
That old bloke wouldn't
even look us in the eye.

01:33:36.990 --> 01:33:38.910
Come on, private!

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:44.600
I know we're officers,
but it's us or the enemy.

01:33:45.690 --> 01:33:48.020
So now is not the time to be particular.

01:33:51.650 --> 01:33:54.250
Well, Churchill got his 30,000.

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:55.550
And then some.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.490
Almost 300,000.

01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:03.160
So far.

01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:06.170
So far?

01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:07.430
I'm staying.

01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:09.990
For the French.

01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:05.310
Hey!

01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:06.640
Where are we?

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.600
Siding. You'll be
pulling in in a minute.

01:35:09.610 --> 01:35:11.230
What station?

01:35:11.230 --> 01:35:12.730
Woking.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.230
Grab me one of them papers.

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.360
Go on!

01:35:30.210 --> 01:35:31.630
Can't bear it.

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:34.630
You read it.

01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:36.420
Can't bear it?

01:35:37.050 --> 01:35:39.260
They'll be spitting
at us in the streets.

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:42.910
If they're not locked up
waiting for the invasion.

01:36:29.370 --> 01:36:31.830
"Wars are not won by evacuations."

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:37.650
I can't look.

01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:39.820
"But there was a victory
inside this deliverance,"

01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:41.820
which should be noted."

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.440
"Our thankfulness at
the escape of our army"

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:52.940
must not blind us to the
fact that what has happened

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:57.300
in France and Belgium is a
colossal military disaster.

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:17.780
We must expect another blow to
be struck almost immediately.

01:37:36.670 --> 01:37:38.380
We shall go on to the end.

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:44.300
We shall fight in France.

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.310
We shall fight on the seas and oceans.

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:06.870
We shall fight with growing confidence
and growing strength in the air.

01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:16.440
We shall defend our island
whatever the cost..."

01:38:16.450 --> 01:38:17.460
What?

01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:21.000
"We shall defend our island
whatever the cost may be.

01:38:21.010 --> 01:38:23.210
We shall fight on the beaches.

01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:24.840
We shall fight on the landing grounds.

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.010
We shall fight in the
fields and in the streets.

01:38:27.010 --> 01:38:28.170
We shall fight in the hills.

01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:31.060
We shall never surrender.

01:38:43.190 --> 01:38:45.820
And even if this island
or a large part of it

01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.740
were subjugated and starving,

01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:51.990
then our Empire beyond the seas,
armed and guarded by the British Fleet,

01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:54.450
would carry on the struggle

01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:57.540
until, in God's good time,

01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:59.690
the New World, with
all its power and might,

01:38:59.690 --> 01:39:03.140
steps forth to the rescue and
the liberation of the old."
