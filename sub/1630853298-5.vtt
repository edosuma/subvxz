WEBVTT

00:17.311 --> 00:20.417
"The Almighty will lay
his hands upon this nation."

00:22.555 --> 00:25.093
"There will be more bloodshed,
more ruin,

00:25.193 --> 00:28.166
more devastation
than they've ever seen."

00:28.199 --> 00:32.642
John Taylor, president,
prophet, seer, and revelator,

00:32.742 --> 00:34.847
1876.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.417
- '79, actually.
- That's a matter of opinion.

00:38.787 --> 00:41.459
He foretold the church
would go into bondage,

00:41.493 --> 00:43.363
and One Mighty and Strong
would appear

00:43.463 --> 00:45.367
to set it back in order.

01:01.332 --> 01:03.470
- Is that you?

01:03.504 --> 01:05.808
You the One?

01:05.908 --> 01:08.380
- I'm but a soldier
in this war.

01:08.413 --> 01:09.883
- Soldiers follow orders,
so who--

01:09.916 --> 01:12.120
who told you to kill Brenda
and her baby?

01:12.220 --> 01:13.791
- What matters
is that I spilled their blood

01:13.824 --> 01:15.861
onto the ground.

01:15.961 --> 01:19.435
- Is that why you--you moved
the baby's body?

01:19.536 --> 01:21.674
Killed her in the bassinet
and then...

01:21.707 --> 01:24.680
laid her body next
to her mother's on the ground.

01:24.713 --> 01:28.186
- That's right, to cleanse her.
- Right.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.229
You're breaking my heart.

01:33.798 --> 01:36.603
The baby's body wasn't laid
with her mother's.

01:36.703 --> 01:38.439
- Then you're a liar.

01:38.540 --> 01:39.609
- I'll ask the Lord
to forgive me,

01:39.709 --> 01:41.246
but you've been lying
this whole time.

01:41.279 --> 01:42.816
The blood on your clothes

01:42.849 --> 01:44.285
wasn't Brenda's,
wasn't Erica's,

01:44.318 --> 01:45.621
wasn't even human.

01:47.291 --> 01:49.295
It was squirrel blood.

01:49.328 --> 01:51.633
- This...it's a sign.

01:51.733 --> 01:54.172
The end of days has arrived.

01:54.205 --> 01:57.445
The School of the Prophets has
restored the one true church,

01:57.478 --> 01:59.649
and Satan refuses
to let you see the truth

01:59.749 --> 02:01.385
because you are wicked.

02:01.485 --> 02:03.524
- School of Prophets?

02:04.760 --> 02:06.596
What's that?

02:06.696 --> 02:07.865
Something you're a part of?

02:11.339 --> 02:13.209
Something Allen's a part of?

02:13.309 --> 02:15.314
- Maybe I don't have
a brother named Allen anymore.

02:15.347 --> 02:16.616
What about Robin?

02:16.716 --> 02:18.186
- Oh, now
you're gonna believe me?

02:18.286 --> 02:20.558
- Sam, what are you doing?
Who are you protecting

02:20.591 --> 02:22.194
with all these lies?

02:24.866 --> 02:27.438
- I will remove your family,

02:27.471 --> 02:29.241
past and future,

02:29.341 --> 02:30.745
from the kingdom of heaven.

02:30.778 --> 02:32.949
I will cast the dust
from my feet

02:33.049 --> 02:35.621
and curse you for all eternity
unless you show me

02:35.721 --> 02:38.494
the respect
Heavenly Father demands.

02:38.594 --> 02:40.498
Respect me!

02:44.438 --> 02:46.610
- School of Prophets. That LDS?

02:46.710 --> 02:48.581
- No,
and it's very, very specific.

02:48.614 --> 02:51.485
Any word from, uh, Morris
or, uh, the Lows?

02:51.586 --> 02:52.722
- No, not yet.

02:52.755 --> 02:53.957
Highway patrol's been notified

02:54.057 --> 02:56.228
in case he left his car
on the side of the road.

02:58.868 --> 03:01.907
- What is the--their Stake
President doing back here?

03:01.940 --> 03:03.977
Looks like the chief's
getting ready to release Robin.

03:04.077 --> 03:05.948
- Probably Sam, too,
if all we got on him

03:06.048 --> 03:07.852
is squirrel blood.

03:07.952 --> 03:10.323
- Gotta be kidding me.
- I wish I was.

03:11.493 --> 03:12.795
Can you slow that down?

03:14.365 --> 03:15.366
- Yeah.

03:15.466 --> 03:16.837
- Just remember,

03:16.937 --> 03:20.377
honey works better
than vinegar here.

03:20.410 --> 03:21.913
- Charm.
- Please.

03:24.051 --> 03:26.723
Why am I still here, Pyre?

03:26.823 --> 03:28.661
I thought we had a deal.
- Yeah, we did.

03:28.694 --> 03:30.632
And I remember saying that, uh,

03:30.665 --> 03:32.935
elements of the truth
are not the whole truth.

03:33.035 --> 03:35.574
- I've told you what I know.
- Everything?

03:36.810 --> 03:38.781
- What about
a School of the Prophets?

03:41.954 --> 03:43.289
- Something the matter
with my shoes?

03:43.389 --> 03:44.559
- Sam?
- Yeah.

03:47.030 --> 03:48.534
It was not a school.

03:48.567 --> 03:50.437
It was more like
scripture study

03:50.538 --> 03:52.809
that my brothers organized
alongside a few others

03:52.842 --> 03:55.447
to explore their areas
of interest.

03:55.548 --> 03:56.716
- I'm very, very curious

03:56.816 --> 03:58.821
about what these
areas of interest were

03:58.854 --> 04:02.461
and if they would square away
with our one true prophet,

04:02.562 --> 04:03.964
Spencer W. Kimball,

04:04.064 --> 04:05.768
or if you were all
trying to unseat

04:05.868 --> 04:06.903
President Kimball.
- Brother.

04:07.003 --> 04:11.079
- Yeah?
- Please, I love our church.

04:11.112 --> 04:14.519
That's why
I have returned to it

04:14.619 --> 04:15.988
with my family.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.426
- Good, so you know there are
worse fates than prison bars,

04:18.527 --> 04:19.863
like ex-communication.

04:23.069 --> 04:25.942
Which most likely means
alienation from your family,

04:25.975 --> 04:28.012
from your friends,
your neighbors, clients.

04:29.114 --> 04:30.584
You know,
maybe I should release you

04:30.684 --> 04:31.720
to your Stake President.

04:31.753 --> 04:33.591
He is right down the hall
right now.

04:33.624 --> 04:34.792
I'm sure
he'd be very, very curious

04:34.892 --> 04:36.630
to hear about your school.

04:40.470 --> 04:41.940
Or...

04:42.040 --> 04:45.347
you can just tell me
everything you know,

04:45.380 --> 04:46.683
and it stays between us.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.646
It started with a man
named Bernard Brady.

05:01.746 --> 05:03.750
He's from Provo.
Businessman.

05:03.850 --> 05:05.487
He was pals with Dan,

05:05.521 --> 05:09.128
then he came around
talking about a Dream Mine

05:09.161 --> 05:12.368
up in Salem, near there,

05:12.401 --> 05:14.906
these prophecies
of hidden Mormon gold

05:15.006 --> 05:18.146
that would "come forth from it
and save the saints

05:18.179 --> 05:19.414
in the end times."

05:19.515 --> 05:20.584
- Fundamentalist
Mormon folklore?

05:20.684 --> 05:21.686
- That's right.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.524
- Do you remember a day
when you picked up Dan

05:23.557 --> 05:25.393
from a tiling job?

05:25.494 --> 05:26.864
- I picked him up a lot.

05:26.897 --> 05:28.501
- There's a day
that Allen was referencing,

05:28.534 --> 05:31.105
one where, uh, you had two men
in your car with beards.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.376
One had a--
a white braided beard.

05:33.476 --> 05:35.413
Uh, were these men
part of your school?

05:35.514 --> 05:36.884
- Yes.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.052
Brady was one of them.

05:38.152 --> 05:40.958
The other would have been
Onias.

05:42.060 --> 05:44.699
- O-N-I-A-S?
- That's right.

05:44.799 --> 05:46.169
- Is that a first name?

05:46.202 --> 05:49.909
- He just called himself
Prophet Onias.

05:56.222 --> 05:58.694
- Pulled out the big guns
with Mr. Stake

05:58.794 --> 05:59.963
my own kids,

06:00.063 --> 06:02.669
two unbaptized Paiute teens

06:02.702 --> 06:05.040
living in the wicked city
of Vegas.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.779
Seemed quite taken
with their potential salvation.

06:07.812 --> 06:09.882
- Very sweet
and absolutely perfect.

06:12.054 --> 06:13.957
Is the chief releasing Robin
to him?

06:14.726 --> 06:17.397
And Sam. You were right.

06:18.099 --> 06:20.871
- Yeah, well,
even if we kept them locked up,

06:20.971 --> 06:21.973
I'm afraid we'd still have

06:22.073 --> 06:23.978
zero credible suspects
in custody.

06:24.011 --> 06:25.815
- Did you get anything new
out of Robin?

06:25.848 --> 06:27.618
- Yeah, two new names
from their school.

06:27.718 --> 06:28.854
- Names are leads, Jeb.
- Yeah.

06:28.887 --> 06:30.858
- Sir, Officer Morris
on the radio.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.162
He found the Lows.

06:35.801 --> 06:37.170
You know, sir, I just--

06:37.270 --> 06:41.045
I just, like, knelt,
and I prayed,

06:41.145 --> 06:42.114
and I listened
for the Holy Spirit.

06:42.147 --> 06:44.819
Good work, Morris.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.692
You know,
it was Heavenly Father

06:47.725 --> 06:49.696
that found them, sir.

06:49.729 --> 06:51.967
It wasn't me.

06:53.871 --> 06:56.008
- You followed the evidence,
Morris.

06:58.046 --> 07:00.149
Just like a good cop does.

07:00.249 --> 07:01.686
- Yeah.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.896
Bishop Low, Sister Low,
can you think of any reason

07:06.996 --> 07:09.836
why you'd find yourselves
on a list of names to be...

07:10.938 --> 07:12.842
To be blood atoned?

07:13.544 --> 07:16.181
- Are--are we, Brother?
You're certain?

07:16.281 --> 07:18.253
We have reason to believe so,

07:18.286 --> 07:21.760
and the--the nature of this
break-in reenforces that.

07:21.860 --> 07:22.962
Unless I'm mistaken,

07:23.062 --> 07:25.166
no items of value
have been taken, right?

07:26.536 --> 07:28.072
- No.

07:28.172 --> 07:29.909
So it stands to reason.

07:38.059 --> 07:41.700
- If I were to guess, I'd say
this goes back to their...

07:41.800 --> 07:43.235
church court.

07:45.173 --> 07:49.181
The excommunication court
of Dan and Ron Lafferty.

07:50.851 --> 07:53.189
- Ron and Dan
were excommunicated?

07:53.289 --> 07:54.191
- Yeah.

08:01.071 --> 08:03.076
Was Ron's case--did it--
did it have anything to do

08:03.109 --> 08:05.279
with him being physical

08:05.379 --> 08:07.183
with his wife, Dianna?

08:08.654 --> 08:11.025
We know
there was a threat of violence

08:11.125 --> 08:12.929
and that this matter
was turned over to you

08:12.962 --> 08:14.264
by Mr. Bascom.

08:16.235 --> 08:17.939
Confidence,

08:17.972 --> 08:19.876
confidence between a bishop
and his fold,

08:19.976 --> 08:20.978
particularly in matters

08:21.078 --> 08:23.684
as delicate
as an excommunication,

08:23.717 --> 08:24.820
is a sacred trust.

08:24.853 --> 08:25.922
Surely you know this,
Brother Pyre.

08:25.955 --> 08:28.025
- Oh, I do, sir, but this
is a murder investigation.

08:28.125 --> 08:31.900
We have two faithful
LDS members who are dead,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.004
and one was
a 15-month-old girl.

08:34.104 --> 08:36.275
So I need you to think
on that little girl

08:36.375 --> 08:38.580
and what they did to her.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.751
And we've already confirmed
that the men who did this

08:40.851 --> 08:42.855
had fundamentalist Mormon ties,

08:42.955 --> 08:44.960
so please, tell me,

08:44.993 --> 08:47.565
which kind of Mormons
are you protecting

08:47.665 --> 08:48.867
with your silence?

08:51.372 --> 08:53.643
I'm honestly asking.

09:00.724 --> 09:02.060
- Ron was not excommunicated

09:02.160 --> 09:04.331
because of his choices
with his wife.

09:04.431 --> 09:06.669
This began with Daniel.

09:29.749 --> 09:30.918
Mm-hmm.

09:47.250 --> 09:49.322
See, this'll only
take a second.

09:53.162 --> 09:54.665
No, no, no, no, hold on.

09:54.765 --> 09:56.301
Please, Dan, no.

09:57.905 --> 10:00.645
I don't like it. It hurts.

10:00.678 --> 10:01.980
Okay.

10:04.017 --> 10:05.654
You're out of alignment.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.002
Oh.

10:14.104 --> 10:15.807
We're just giving her
an adjustment.

10:15.907 --> 10:16.909
- Cora, get out
of the room now.

10:16.943 --> 10:18.212
Hey, no, you have
nothing to be ashamed of.

10:18.312 --> 10:20.082
She has nothing
to be ashamed of.

10:20.182 --> 10:22.688
Listen, darling, sit down.
Come and sit with us.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.159
Cora, would you get your mother
a glass of water?

10:26.863 --> 10:28.065
Come sit.

10:33.810 --> 10:35.112
What were you doing?

10:36.448 --> 10:37.952
What were you doing?

10:39.254 --> 10:41.192
- I knew this day would come.

10:41.225 --> 10:43.697
I knew it.
When we were reunited, I knew.

10:48.205 --> 10:51.947
God has given me
a vigorous sexual spirit,

10:51.980 --> 10:53.415
and now I know why.

10:55.119 --> 10:59.127
I have been prompted to ask you

10:59.227 --> 11:01.031
if you would accept
our sweet girl

11:01.131 --> 11:02.868
as your first sister wife.

11:04.505 --> 11:06.441
- My love...

11:06.542 --> 11:09.081
in our pre-Earth life,

11:09.114 --> 11:11.018
we were all created
with a soul mate,

11:11.118 --> 11:12.956
and you are mine.

11:12.989 --> 11:17.463
But we have been promised
to be gods in the eternities,

11:17.564 --> 11:19.769
which is why we have
the sacred principle.

11:22.173 --> 11:26.382
The more wives we marry,
the more children we sire,

11:26.415 --> 11:30.222
and the greater the glory
in worlds without end.

11:31.559 --> 11:35.801
Cora's far too precious
to be married to an unholy man.

11:37.203 --> 11:39.108
Same with Eilidh.

11:39.141 --> 11:41.478
- No, you can't--I can't--

11:41.579 --> 11:43.415
- Matilda. Matilda.
- I won't let you.

11:43.516 --> 11:46.523
- To deny
your priesthood holder

11:46.556 --> 11:47.825
is fornication.

11:47.925 --> 11:49.028
You know that.

11:49.061 --> 11:51.799
And fornication
is punishable by what,

11:51.899 --> 11:53.102
my love?

11:55.908 --> 11:57.511
- Death.
Death.

12:01.218 --> 12:05.260
Do not make me imagine a life
without you.

12:05.293 --> 12:07.163
Don't do that to me.

12:09.034 --> 12:11.305
Now, tell me,

12:11.338 --> 12:14.377
what is it
that you know to be true?

12:19.154 --> 12:21.124
- Heavenly Father
sent you to me.

12:23.329 --> 12:25.300
I know this because...

12:25.333 --> 12:27.304
I was moved by the Holy Spirit
the day we met.

12:27.337 --> 12:28.941
- That is good,
and that is true.

12:28.974 --> 12:31.211
- And I cannot...

12:31.311 --> 12:33.282
complain because
of your righteousness,

12:33.382 --> 12:35.419
and now we follow God's will.

12:42.634 --> 12:45.941
This is a momentous day
for our family.

12:46.576 --> 12:49.816
Tonight, Cora,
you will sleep in your own bed.

12:49.849 --> 12:52.955
And tomorrow
we will begin something

12:52.988 --> 12:56.028
so, so very special.

13:00.369 --> 13:03.209
Matilda
was horrified, of course,

13:03.242 --> 13:06.082
and didn't want
anyone to get hurt.

13:17.638 --> 13:19.875
I want you
to ask the Lord to guide you

13:19.975 --> 13:20.978
and do as He commands.

13:21.011 --> 13:22.413
Do you understand?

13:22.514 --> 13:24.518
I love you both very much.

13:26.188 --> 13:28.527
And we'll see each other again,
promise.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.093
No, it's fine.

13:45.126 --> 13:47.296
It's just the dogs.
- No, no.

13:47.396 --> 13:49.568
- It's the dog breaking
into the trash again.

13:49.668 --> 13:51.540
You gotta catch a dog
in the act.

13:51.573 --> 13:54.044
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
Yeah.

13:54.144 --> 13:56.014
- But I want you now.

13:58.621 --> 14:00.322
If you can't satisfy one wife,
how will you please three?

14:04.599 --> 14:05.668
Come here.

14:29.982 --> 14:32.320
They ran
right to their old church.

14:32.353 --> 14:34.124
And it was their account

14:34.224 --> 14:36.061
that led
to Daniel's excommunication.

14:36.094 --> 14:37.531
- Where are they now?

14:39.535 --> 14:41.338
Did you call Child Services?

14:41.371 --> 14:43.342
- We put them
in a very good home.

14:43.442 --> 14:44.712
And?

14:44.745 --> 14:47.618
- And they ran away.
Of course they did.

14:47.651 --> 14:50.089
You know, there's a reason
why even the state of Utah

14:50.122 --> 14:52.194
has Child Protective Services.

14:52.227 --> 14:53.597
Has anyone heard
from them since?

14:53.630 --> 14:54.665
- No.

14:55.634 --> 14:57.069
- Well, now their mother's
gone missing too.

14:57.169 --> 14:58.439
But it's not your problem.

14:58.472 --> 15:00.945
- Brother Pyre,
a decision was made.

15:00.978 --> 15:04.351
The Lafferty name had
brought about enough spectacle.

15:04.384 --> 15:06.455
To add fuel to that fire
was not in our interest.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.425
- Who's "our"?
- The church's interest.

15:08.526 --> 15:10.262
Our Heavenly Father's interest.

15:10.362 --> 15:12.300
Hey.

15:15.339 --> 15:17.377
- Thank you, Brother Pyre.
Of course.

15:17.410 --> 15:20.316
So how did this lead
to Ron's excommunication?

15:22.120 --> 15:24.424
- These issues,
they came to a head at the--

15:24.525 --> 15:28.500
the naming ceremony
of baby Erica.

15:28.533 --> 15:30.470
It was a beautiful day.

15:30.504 --> 15:32.474
All the Lafferty men
were there

15:32.508 --> 15:33.643
except for Daniel.

15:33.743 --> 15:35.246
Now invite all the worthy

15:35.346 --> 15:36.549
Melchizedek Priesthood holders.

15:36.649 --> 15:39.588
And the name
by which she shall be known

15:39.688 --> 15:41.993
is Erica Jean Lafferty.

15:42.093 --> 15:43.362
It's all right.

15:43.395 --> 15:46.101
Afterwards Ron, uh--

15:46.134 --> 15:48.272
he, uh--he cornered me,

15:48.305 --> 15:52.446
started asking me questions
about Daniel's excommunication.

15:52.547 --> 15:53.517
Politics of his nation.

15:53.550 --> 15:55.720
It was a--a tax law,

15:55.820 --> 15:57.490
yeah, that would hurt
the flock.

15:57.591 --> 15:59.027
And you excommunicate a man
for that?

15:59.127 --> 16:00.997
- Political issues
were not at the center

16:01.097 --> 16:02.400
of your brother's trial.
- Right. What was?

16:02.501 --> 16:03.570
- But that's all I can say.
- What was?

16:04.572 --> 16:05.472
- I can't say.
That's Dan's private business.

16:06.308 --> 16:08.078
- Was it his research?
Is that it?

16:08.178 --> 16:10.283
Research into the church
scriptures, into our history?

16:10.316 --> 16:11.418
- All right, listen,
Brother Lafferty,

16:11.451 --> 16:12.486
there's nothing of value
to be learned.

16:12.587 --> 16:13.756
- Nothing of value
to be learned?

16:14.825 --> 16:15.827
- Nothing of value
from your brother's research.

16:15.860 --> 16:17.698
That is the truth.
- What are you so scared of?

16:17.798 --> 16:19.467
Do you think
that he was gonna get closer

16:19.568 --> 16:22.073
to the Eternal Father than you?

16:23.643 --> 16:27.050
You had a conversation
with Dianna and Brenda?

16:27.083 --> 16:29.387
- Yes, um...

16:29.487 --> 16:31.091
Dianna, has he hurt you?

16:33.095 --> 16:35.199
Okay, well, you have to talk
to someone.

16:35.299 --> 16:36.670
Right, Sister Low?

16:36.703 --> 16:38.706
And if you won't,
I'll do it for you.

16:40.176 --> 16:42.748
Dianna, you do know
Dan was excommunicated.

16:44.150 --> 16:47.524
I mean, maybe
that's what Ron wants too.

16:47.624 --> 16:49.596
- Sister Lafferty.
- How can you say that?

16:49.629 --> 16:51.700
I'm not saying
that he should be.

16:51.733 --> 16:53.570
I don't know,
maybe the threat of a trial

16:53.603 --> 16:56.341
will zap him back
into the 20th century.

16:56.441 --> 16:58.211
He kept pressing.

16:58.311 --> 17:00.483
Of course,
I couldn't say anything.

17:00.517 --> 17:04.090
You know what, Ron?
Right now, you are scaring me.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.192
What's going on here?

17:07.698 --> 17:09.201
as your brother?

17:09.234 --> 17:11.472
Let's not do this, Ron.

17:11.506 --> 17:14.846
The church asks us
to rely on faith

17:14.879 --> 17:17.283
when we find
seeming contradictions

17:17.383 --> 17:18.754
in our history,
in our scriptures.

17:18.787 --> 17:19.589
- Four...

17:19.622 --> 17:21.559
That we are to be humble

17:21.659 --> 17:23.228
in the face of confusion.

17:23.328 --> 17:24.464
- Six...

17:24.498 --> 17:26.468
- Come on.
- Seven...

17:26.502 --> 17:29.541
- Ron.
Dad, can we please go?

17:29.641 --> 17:31.679
- That's right,
can we please go?

17:31.779 --> 17:33.816
This is a day for joy, Ron.

17:33.916 --> 17:36.789
All right?
- Okay. You want joy?

17:36.889 --> 17:39.127
- And then he--

17:39.227 --> 17:40.363
well, he threatened me.

17:40.396 --> 17:41.733
- You mind your own family,

17:41.766 --> 17:44.370
and you stay
the hell away from mine.

17:45.473 --> 17:47.477
My heart went out to Dianna.

17:47.511 --> 17:49.481
I can see that your concern

17:49.515 --> 17:52.521
stems from love
for your sister.

17:52.554 --> 17:55.326
But these solutions
are not our role.

17:55.426 --> 17:59.300
Our job is to dedicate ourself
to...

17:59.400 --> 18:00.637
- Creating a home
and environment

18:00.670 --> 18:03.442
to sustain and support
our priesthood holder.

18:03.543 --> 18:06.481
MRS.
And no, it's not always easy,

18:06.582 --> 18:08.586
even for a bishop's wife,

18:08.686 --> 18:10.322
but it is our calling.

18:10.422 --> 18:11.592
Wouldn't you agree?

18:11.626 --> 18:15.332
- So you told a wife living
under the threat of violence

18:15.432 --> 18:16.869
to work harder.

18:16.969 --> 18:18.540
- You will not come into
my home and attack my wife.

18:18.573 --> 18:19.909
Is that clear?

18:19.942 --> 18:21.813
This falls
under my stewardship.

18:27.824 --> 18:29.829
- Okay.

18:29.862 --> 18:34.171
Does a good steward encourage
a wife to blame herself

18:34.204 --> 18:35.740
instead of holding
her abuser accountable?

18:35.840 --> 18:38.880
- I did as the church instructs
us to do, Brother Pyre.

18:38.980 --> 18:42.688
When, uh,
Dianna came to us again

18:42.721 --> 18:44.792
a--a few months back,

18:44.892 --> 18:46.896
um, with more bruises
on her face...

18:46.996 --> 18:48.566
I encouraged her
to get to safety.

18:48.666 --> 18:50.704
I even gave her
some money to do so.

18:50.804 --> 18:52.674
- Detective Pyre.
- Wait.

18:53.977 --> 18:55.948
W-where did Dianna go?

18:55.981 --> 18:59.321
- In all honesty, that was
the last I saw of our sister.

18:59.354 --> 19:01.191
I don't know.

19:01.291 --> 19:03.796
- We, uh, found Bernard Brady.

19:03.896 --> 19:05.868
We think he's at his home now,
for now.

19:05.901 --> 19:07.738
- All right.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.641
We'll post an officer
outside your home.

19:09.741 --> 19:11.211
I'll be back by morning.
Thank you.

19:12.648 --> 19:14.618
It's a nice neighborhood
up in the hills.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.723
Closer to the Lord, they say.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.691
It's the nice neighborhoods

19:17.791 --> 19:19.193
that worry me the most.

19:48.285 --> 19:49.588
Mrs. Brady?

19:49.688 --> 19:50.990
- Oh, my gosh. Hi.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.059
Sorry to bother you, Sister.

19:52.092 --> 19:54.765
I'm Detective Pyre.
This is Detective Taba.

19:54.865 --> 19:58.873
We were hoping we could speak
with a Mr. Bernard Brady.

19:58.973 --> 20:00.977
You got me, boys.

20:01.077 --> 20:04.251
Uh, we're kinda--kinda busy
with the kids

20:04.284 --> 20:05.521
just at the moment.

20:05.554 --> 20:07.657
But, uh, heck,
how's tomorrow morning for you?

20:07.757 --> 20:08.926
I'm a early bird.

20:12.668 --> 20:13.870
No time like the present.

20:13.970 --> 20:15.507
Shall we?

20:15.607 --> 20:17.945
- Sure, okay. Uh, gosh.
Come on in. Come on in.

20:17.978 --> 20:19.515
Thank you.

20:19.615 --> 20:22.420
Uh, you can meet
the whole Brady brood. Ha.

20:22.453 --> 20:25.359
MRS.
Uh, everybody's just in here.

20:25.459 --> 20:29.333
This is Jacob and Rebecca
and Vanessa

20:29.433 --> 20:31.305
and Isaac and Sarah.

20:31.338 --> 20:32.541
Very nice to meet you all.

20:32.574 --> 20:33.710
- Nice to meet you guys.
MRS.Yeah.

20:33.743 --> 20:35.412
W-we'll sit
in the front room here.

20:35.513 --> 20:36.549
All right, perfect.

20:36.649 --> 20:37.985
Just make yourselves at home.

20:38.018 --> 20:39.521
MRS.
Please, come on in.

20:39.621 --> 20:40.790
We understand
that you have, uh,

20:40.890 --> 20:42.293
some kind of connection
to the Laffertys,

20:42.393 --> 20:44.331
specifically Ron--
is that correct?

20:44.364 --> 20:45.767
- Well, we know Ron.
- Mm-hmm.

20:45.867 --> 20:47.838
- We let him sleep right here
on that couch.

20:47.938 --> 20:49.007
Isn't that right, honey?

20:49.041 --> 20:50.643
- Yeah, when--when he
and Dianna were struggling.

20:50.743 --> 20:52.446
MRS.
And I was clear with him.

20:52.547 --> 20:55.052
I said if he ever got physical
with his wife again,

20:55.152 --> 20:56.922
I would call the police myself.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.393
- Physical.
How'd he get physical?

20:59.494 --> 21:02.266
MRS.
Well, Ron, um...

21:03.401 --> 21:05.773
After he got his letter...

21:05.873 --> 21:06.909
- Brother Lafferty.

21:15.059 --> 21:16.595
I think it's important

21:16.695 --> 21:18.799
to understand the context
of where he was at

21:18.899 --> 21:20.504
at that time, you know?

21:20.537 --> 21:21.906
He'd just been called
into church court.

21:21.939 --> 21:25.479
He'd been undermined
as an authority figure, and...

21:34.498 --> 21:36.001
So how is it
that my beloved wife

21:36.034 --> 21:39.642
is the one responsible for me
being pulled into church court?

21:39.675 --> 21:40.977
- It doesn't have
to come to that.

21:41.077 --> 21:43.448
You can--you can call
the bishop, seek his counsel--

21:43.549 --> 21:44.450
- I don't need his counsel.

21:44.484 --> 21:45.553
I need you to stop mocking
my authority.

21:45.587 --> 21:48.392
I need you to stop shaming me
to my--to my church.

21:48.425 --> 21:49.495
I'm not saying
I'm not without blame.

21:49.528 --> 21:51.866
I'm--we could--we could go
to counseling together.

21:51.966 --> 21:53.769
Oh!

22:01.652 --> 22:04.390
You will submit willingly.

22:05.627 --> 22:07.363
Or I will starve you
into obedience.

22:11.104 --> 22:12.774
Mm-hmm.

22:16.682 --> 22:18.385
- Oh!
- All right, come on.

22:18.418 --> 22:20.389
Come on, come here.

22:20.489 --> 22:22.427
Leave him.

22:22.460 --> 22:23.796
I said leave him!

22:25.834 --> 22:28.940
I will not have you
drag my children

22:28.973 --> 22:30.811
into your madness.

22:30.844 --> 22:32.647
Come here, David.

22:32.747 --> 22:34.483
Come here.

22:34.584 --> 22:36.956
Ron, leave him!

22:36.989 --> 22:38.092
Come here, honey. Come here.

22:38.125 --> 22:39.460
Go to your sister.

22:41.064 --> 22:44.370
You get out of this house,
and don't you ever come back!

22:58.131 --> 23:00.102
He came here, ashamed.

23:00.135 --> 23:01.706
He was really working
on himself.

23:01.739 --> 23:03.108
You know, scripture study,
prayer,

23:03.208 --> 23:05.713
uh, Old Testament,
New Testament,

23:05.813 --> 23:07.483
uh, Book of Mormon,
Pearl of Great Price--

23:07.517 --> 23:09.053
- Well, these boys will study
just about anything

23:09.153 --> 23:10.857
to get out
of hosing my gutters.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.695
- Well, she got me.

23:12.728 --> 23:15.432
Uh, but, uh, Ron, no,
he was taking it serious.

23:15.533 --> 23:17.103
Yeah, a couple
of his brothers came.

23:17.136 --> 23:18.806
I think it really helped him.

23:18.906 --> 23:20.442
- Sir, does the term
"School of Prophets"

23:20.543 --> 23:22.413
mean anything to you?

23:22.514 --> 23:24.183
- Uh...no.

23:24.283 --> 23:25.453
Uh, should it?

23:25.486 --> 23:26.856
I'm just curious.

23:26.889 --> 23:30.897
And was, um, one of the men
in this group named Onias?

23:30.930 --> 23:32.466
- Oh.

23:32.567 --> 23:34.136
- Well, I don't think there's
a scripture study in Utah

23:34.236 --> 23:35.974
that he wouldn't feel
at home at,

23:36.074 --> 23:38.846
especially if there's
a home-cooked meal involved.

23:38.946 --> 23:40.883
BERNARD Yeah.
MRS.Eccentric.

23:40.983 --> 23:42.621
- Yup.
- Heck yes.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.490
And dang time-consuming.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.827
How so?

23:45.927 --> 23:47.498
- He won't get a car.

23:47.531 --> 23:49.801
Okay, one time, one time,

23:49.901 --> 23:52.473
Robin and I
offered to pick him up.

23:52.507 --> 23:54.110
Hours of my life,
and let me tell you,

23:54.210 --> 23:55.747
that man ain't a fan
of bathing.

23:55.847 --> 23:57.016
- Oof!

23:58.118 --> 23:59.522
- W-when was the last time
you heard from Mr. Onias?

23:59.555 --> 24:01.124
- Oh, uh, it's been ages now.

24:01.224 --> 24:02.627
It's not like
you can call him up.

24:02.727 --> 24:03.729
The man doesn't believe
in telephones either.

24:03.829 --> 24:04.898
MRS.- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

24:04.998 --> 24:07.904
You--you and Robin,
did you happen to...

24:08.004 --> 24:11.779
also pick up Ron's brother Dan
on--on that day?

24:13.983 --> 24:16.522
- Ha, you're good.
You're good, yeah.

24:16.555 --> 24:18.592
No, I completely forgot
about that, right, yeah.

24:18.692 --> 24:20.863
I was a regular
scripture study taxi driver.

24:22.199 --> 24:25.573
Is there, uh, anything else
we can do to help you at all?

24:25.673 --> 24:27.176
Honestly, just name it.
Anything.

24:27.209 --> 24:28.445
Uh, nothing at the time.

24:28.478 --> 24:31.985
- Just so sorry that we've, um,
barged in on you like this.

24:32.085 --> 24:34.490
And, uh, I'm gonna leave you
my, uh--my number

24:34.591 --> 24:36.862
in case Mr. Onias, uh,
reaches out

24:36.962 --> 24:38.198
or if you think
of anything else

24:38.298 --> 24:39.901
that may be helpful.

24:40.001 --> 24:41.071
We really appreciate
your time today.

24:41.104 --> 24:43.007
Sir.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.947
- Honey, how--how about
you make some of your lemonade

24:45.980 --> 24:48.085
for these hardworking boys
before they go?

24:48.118 --> 24:50.256
MRS.Oh, well, they may
have things to do, hon.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.559
Well, I'm sure they do,

24:51.592 --> 24:53.028
but, boy, would they love it.

24:53.128 --> 24:54.097
It's the least we can do.

24:54.130 --> 24:56.735
Uh, fresh-squeezed okay?

24:58.706 --> 25:00.543
- I mean, that sounds--
sounds terrific

25:00.643 --> 25:02.146
to--to me, Mrs.--

25:02.246 --> 25:03.683
Sister Brady,
if you don't mind.

25:03.716 --> 25:05.987
- Okay. I'll be just a minute.

25:11.431 --> 25:15.205
So why do you have a letter
written to you, from you?

25:15.305 --> 25:17.242
Certified mail.

25:18.111 --> 25:21.852
- Look, it's just us,
uh, men here, right?

25:23.890 --> 25:26.829
Scripture study, uh,
sometimes, um,

25:26.929 --> 25:30.002
drifted a little,
you know, toward--

25:30.035 --> 25:33.008
we talked about--
- Toward the old ways?

25:33.041 --> 25:34.544
Polygamy?

25:35.613 --> 25:36.982
- Don't tell her.

25:37.082 --> 25:39.588
Okay? Um...

25:39.688 --> 25:41.726
you fellas can see it clear
that I-I struck gold

25:41.759 --> 25:43.028
with that lady in there.

25:43.061 --> 25:46.001
You wouldn't want
to break up a family.

25:46.034 --> 25:48.740
- "I, Bernard Brady,

25:48.773 --> 25:51.913
"do herby depose
in this signed affidavit

25:51.946 --> 25:55.686
"attesting that a group known
as School of the Prophets

25:55.786 --> 25:58.358
"is presently constructing
a list of names

25:58.458 --> 26:00.195
of those who must pay
eternal consequences."

26:00.295 --> 26:02.300
- A list.
- "Eternal consequences."

26:02.333 --> 26:03.869
Does that mean death,
Brother Brady?

26:03.969 --> 26:05.607
'Cause it certainly does
in the Old Testament.

26:05.640 --> 26:06.975
- Oh, I wouldn't know.
- Oh, you wouldn't?

26:07.075 --> 26:08.613
Even with all
your scripture study?

26:08.646 --> 26:10.282
You went through
all the trouble of--

26:10.315 --> 26:11.652
of writing this,

26:11.685 --> 26:13.890
sending it to yourself,
notarized--

26:13.923 --> 26:15.794
- As a precaution. Please,
can you keep your voice down?

26:15.827 --> 26:18.766
- Your wife is the least
of your problems right now.

26:18.866 --> 26:21.137
There was a list made,
but there are no names on here.

26:21.237 --> 26:22.707
- I left the group
the moment they even suggested

26:22.807 --> 26:24.077
the idea of a list.

26:24.110 --> 26:27.115
- So you wrote this
in order to what?

26:27.215 --> 26:28.919
- Well, in case they actually--

26:29.019 --> 26:31.859
- Protecting your own backside
would have meant coming to us,

26:31.959 --> 26:35.032
not writing this self-serving,
useless letter

26:35.065 --> 26:36.768
that's been sitting--
- I will do anything you say.

26:36.868 --> 26:37.871
Anything.

26:38.773 --> 26:39.140
- Well,
sit your doughy backside down.

26:40.176 --> 26:41.011
- And you're gonna answer
every single question

26:41.044 --> 26:42.781
that I ask you
fully and truthfully.

26:42.814 --> 26:44.383
- Okay.
Do you understand?

26:44.483 --> 26:45.887
Before you left this group,

26:45.987 --> 26:48.660
did you hear any other names
being mentioned

26:48.693 --> 26:49.929
as possible candidates
for this list?

26:49.962 --> 26:51.063
- No.
- Brenda?

26:51.163 --> 26:52.968
- No.
Bishop Low?

26:53.001 --> 26:53.970
- No, no, sir.

26:54.003 --> 26:56.942
- How about Dianna, Ron's wife?

26:57.744 --> 27:01.284
- Well, I mean--I mean,
after what she wrote...

27:02.019 --> 27:04.089
Look, she wouldn't be
the first woman

27:04.189 --> 27:05.660
to dash off something
she had no right to

27:05.760 --> 27:07.330
and have it...

27:07.363 --> 27:08.666
lead to bloodshed.

27:08.699 --> 27:09.734
Oh, yeah? Who else?

27:09.834 --> 27:12.172
- Brother.

27:14.845 --> 27:16.648
Our greatest loss
can be traced back

27:16.748 --> 27:18.084
to words written by a wife

27:18.184 --> 27:19.788
who thought she knew better
than her husband.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.658
- No, no,
we're not going there.

27:21.758 --> 27:25.065
- You know, a minute ago,
he was all caught up

27:25.165 --> 27:27.236
about Dianna
getting knocked around.

27:27.336 --> 27:29.373
And now I'm hearing reversal.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.377
I mean,
as the only nonmember here,

27:31.477 --> 27:34.117
I need an education.

27:34.150 --> 27:35.385
Detective?

27:39.293 --> 27:40.830
- Go ahead.

27:42.299 --> 27:43.702
- Look.

27:45.238 --> 27:48.378
Blood found our Zion

27:48.411 --> 27:52.352
the moment Emma stuck her nose
where it didn't belong.

27:56.327 --> 28:00.169
She publicly aligned herself
with a publisher

28:00.202 --> 28:03.274
who defied the prophet's
holy principle of polygamy.

28:04.043 --> 28:07.750
- The lies he has printed
are so wicked,

28:07.850 --> 28:12.159
he shall spend his eternity
in outer darkness.

28:12.259 --> 28:14.363
Why is Uncle Hyrum so upset

28:14.463 --> 28:16.100
with Brother Law?

28:16.200 --> 28:20.042
- Mr. Law dared print
the truth, Joseph.

28:20.075 --> 28:23.448
Gather your brothers.
We must find your father.

28:23.481 --> 28:24.985
The U.S. government
is not likely

28:25.085 --> 28:27.422
to abide the destruction
of the newspaper.

28:28.458 --> 28:32.934
- I have a writ for the arrest
of Joseph and Hyrum Smith.

28:32.967 --> 28:37.209
Anyone who protects them
will also be hung.

28:38.378 --> 28:39.914
Okay.

28:41.384 --> 28:43.254
Don't waste any time,
all right?

28:44.825 --> 28:46.260
Brother Taylor.

28:52.139 --> 28:54.243
Where is my husband?

28:54.343 --> 28:56.447
- He is in the wind.

28:57.383 --> 29:00.957
Running like a dog
for defending the word of God.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.994
- He ordered the destruction
of a newspaper

29:03.094 --> 29:04.531
for printing words
that dare question

29:04.631 --> 29:08.204
a revelation
about collecting wives.

29:09.006 --> 29:11.478
Are you all
so very fragile now?

29:11.512 --> 29:13.382
- The truth is,
there is no doubt

29:13.415 --> 29:15.218
about where your loyalties lie.

29:15.318 --> 29:17.824
I am sending word
for Brigham to return.

29:17.924 --> 29:21.097
I have a writ
for the arrest of Joseph...

29:21.130 --> 29:25.071
- No need to send for Brigham,
Brother Taylor.

29:25.171 --> 29:27.275
In my husband's absence,
our eldest son

29:27.375 --> 29:28.812
will be placed in leadership.

29:28.912 --> 29:30.816
- Your son does not yet shave.

29:32.954 --> 29:35.125
In seeking to sway
our true prophet

29:35.158 --> 29:38.231
from God's path,
witness what you've conjured.

29:38.264 --> 29:40.537
Blood stains our street.

29:40.570 --> 29:44.076
Soon Gentiles
will march through Zion.

29:45.178 --> 29:48.484
Brigham is His
most faithful servant.

29:48.585 --> 29:50.321
He will set us back in order...

29:51.892 --> 29:54.029
Until your husband's return.

29:54.129 --> 29:55.499
George.

29:58.070 --> 29:59.875
I mean,
could you blame a congregation

29:59.908 --> 30:01.344
for wanting to remove her?

30:01.444 --> 30:04.584
So if a wife objects
to her husband's demand

30:04.684 --> 30:06.087
for more wives,

30:06.187 --> 30:09.093
then it's A-okay
to blood atone her?

30:09.193 --> 30:10.830
Where are the other
members of this group?

30:10.930 --> 30:13.201
- Uh, I swear, I-I don't know.

30:15.005 --> 30:17.075
No, please, don't be dramatic!
Brother--Brother Pyre!

30:17.175 --> 30:18.946
Please, please, please!
Okay, okay.

30:19.046 --> 30:20.950
I'll cooperate, okay?

30:21.050 --> 30:23.856
Okay, uh, when Dan--

30:23.956 --> 30:26.394
when Dan got out of jail,

30:26.495 --> 30:28.932
he talked about building
a compound out in the sticks,

30:29.032 --> 30:31.370
uh, an old house
that he and his brothers

30:31.470 --> 30:32.874
used to vandalize.

30:32.974 --> 30:35.045
They called it the farm,
and, um,

30:35.078 --> 30:37.584
if I were to guess,
I would start there.

30:37.617 --> 30:39.286
- No time like the present.

30:39.386 --> 30:41.257
All right.
- Okay.

30:41.357 --> 30:43.294
Well, um, thank you very much
for coming, gentlemen,

30:43.394 --> 30:45.900
and Heavenly Father
be with you, Brother.

30:45.933 --> 30:48.305
And, um...

30:48.338 --> 30:50.209
you too, pal.

30:50.242 --> 30:51.277
So darn brave.

30:52.981 --> 30:54.316
MRS.
Well, I had to use brown sugar,

30:54.416 --> 30:55.920
so it's not as pretty,

30:55.953 --> 30:58.058
but it's still dang delicious.

30:58.091 --> 30:59.595
That's very kind, ma'am,
thank you.

30:59.628 --> 31:01.164
- Sweetie.
MRS.- Yeah.

31:01.197 --> 31:04.605
- Uh, I'm going to need
to help these fine men,

31:04.638 --> 31:06.440
uh, crack this case wide open
now, okay?

31:06.541 --> 31:08.579
- We--we'll get him back
to you faster than you can say

31:08.612 --> 31:10.215
"Lamanite" three times fast.

31:10.248 --> 31:11.351
How's that, huh?

31:11.384 --> 31:13.088
Shall we?

31:13.121 --> 31:15.258
Dear Lord, God of Israel...

31:18.999 --> 31:21.471
Uh, i-if we're really going
to their farm, um...

31:21.505 --> 31:25.445
could I get a bulletproof vest,
please, Brother?

31:26.648 --> 31:28.653
- See what we can do, sure.

31:28.686 --> 31:30.489
- Thank you.

31:40.977 --> 31:43.414
You think you could sketch
the layout of the farm?

31:43.515 --> 31:45.218
Whatever you can remember.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.355
- Sure.

31:49.260 --> 31:52.600
I mean, it's not really a farm.

31:52.700 --> 31:55.940
Not for generations.
It's a dump.

31:56.040 --> 32:00.082
We used to shoot lizards there
as kids.

32:00.115 --> 32:01.250
- Remember the address?

32:01.350 --> 32:03.288
- No.

32:03.321 --> 32:05.425
But I could find it by sight.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.497
- Yeah? Great.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.105
Not the simplest
layout to secure.

32:12.205 --> 32:14.243
Why do we need the civilians?

32:14.276 --> 32:17.315
Allen's our navigator,
and Mr. Brady's gonna help us

32:17.415 --> 32:18.585
ID whoever we may find.

32:18.685 --> 32:20.054
They'll stay back
behind the vehicles

32:20.154 --> 32:22.527
until it's all clear.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.731
- Well,
these constitutionalist types,

32:24.831 --> 32:26.669
they, uh, treasure
their Second Amendment,

32:26.702 --> 32:30.141
so I say we hit this
at the crack o'

32:30.241 --> 32:31.410
so we're not just
target practice.

32:31.511 --> 32:32.747
- All right, dawn it is.
Thank you, sir.

32:32.847 --> 32:33.682
Thanks, guys.

32:39.426 --> 32:41.631
- I sent a patrol car
down to Salem,

32:41.731 --> 32:43.569
trying to lay eyes
on this Onias character.

32:43.602 --> 32:46.675
- Well, a braided beard
should stick out down there.

32:48.344 --> 32:50.114
8 1/2 hours.

32:51.818 --> 32:54.156
- It's Monday.

32:54.189 --> 32:56.026
Family home evening, right?

32:57.429 --> 32:59.399
You could just make it.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.303
Might even squeeze in
a walk with your mom.

33:02.239 --> 33:04.409
It's beautiful out.
- Bill...

33:05.211 --> 33:08.050
Careful, there may be
a saint in you after all.

33:08.150 --> 33:09.487
- No, no.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.691
I'm afraid I'm a zealot
in the Church of Caffeine.

33:13.094 --> 33:14.664
Who's up tonight?

33:14.764 --> 33:17.135
- Uh, Annie.

33:17.235 --> 33:18.705
She's been, uh--

33:18.805 --> 33:21.043
she's been making cutouts
all week.

33:21.143 --> 33:24.416
Apparently ancient Israel
had kangaroos and pandas.

33:24.517 --> 33:26.253
- I like it.

33:26.353 --> 33:28.024
- Get outta here.

33:28.124 --> 33:31.463
- You sure?
- Yeah. I got this.

33:33.736 --> 33:36.074
- Partner.
- You bet.

33:59.420 --> 34:00.623
- Hello.

34:07.503 --> 34:08.572
Becca?

35:19.581 --> 35:21.551
Okay.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.158
Hello.

35:26.762 --> 35:29.568
It's, uh, Brother Pyre.

35:29.601 --> 35:31.705
Is--is, uh--is Becca there?

35:31.738 --> 35:33.576
- I'll get her for you,
Brother Pyre.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.445
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

35:38.384 --> 35:40.355
- Thank you.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.226
Hi.
Hey, sweetie.

35:42.259 --> 35:43.763
- I-I figured
you'd be still at work.

35:43.796 --> 35:45.600
I, um--I-I didn't want
to bother you

35:45.633 --> 35:47.168
with our ever-changing plans.

35:47.268 --> 35:49.608
- I gotta head back to work
in a few hours anyway.

35:49.641 --> 35:52.312
I just thought
I'd try and catch the end

35:52.412 --> 35:53.682
of Annie's lesson.

35:53.782 --> 35:55.552
Oh, it was a hit.

35:55.652 --> 35:56.888
The kids had so much fun,

35:56.988 --> 35:59.426
and they built a fort
for a sleepover.

36:00.896 --> 36:04.169
- And, um,
your mom's doing really well.

36:04.269 --> 36:06.574
She just played
a game of Clue, Jeb.

36:06.674 --> 36:08.779
- She played Clue?

36:08.812 --> 36:10.415
Yeah.
- Really?

36:10.516 --> 36:12.419
Yeah, I mean,
it was her and Annie, but...

36:15.291 --> 36:17.228
Hey, i-if you're not
comfortable with us being here,

36:17.328 --> 36:19.634
I can wake the girls up and--
No, no, no.

36:19.734 --> 36:21.236
You're all settled in.

36:21.336 --> 36:23.340
You stay.
I'll, um--

36:24.711 --> 36:26.581
Yeah, I trust you, honey.

36:26.681 --> 36:27.917
Thank you. I love you.

36:27.950 --> 36:29.955
I love you.

36:29.988 --> 36:31.925
- Okay.

37:01.852 --> 37:04.690
- School of the Prophets,
plural?

37:06.728 --> 37:09.935
If there is
only one true church

37:09.968 --> 37:12.406
with only one true prophet,

37:12.439 --> 37:13.942
how could it be plural?

37:16.313 --> 37:18.586
There can be only one.

37:18.619 --> 37:20.789
Right? Remember?

37:22.359 --> 37:23.795
I mean, when--
when the early saints

37:23.895 --> 37:25.431
started splitting into camps,

37:25.532 --> 37:26.969
monogamists versus polygamists,

37:27.002 --> 37:29.507
Emma's camp
versus Joseph's or Brigham's,

37:29.607 --> 37:32.378
did they split
the prophet seat in two?

37:32.478 --> 37:33.982
No.

37:34.751 --> 37:37.990
So with Joseph in hiding,
who is steering the ship?

37:39.860 --> 37:41.363
Brigham Young.

37:46.941 --> 37:48.979
Take this to Joseph.

37:50.516 --> 37:54.422
Once he returns
to the true path of the Lord,

37:54.523 --> 37:57.328
Heavenly Father's protection
will be restored.

37:57.428 --> 38:01.738
- What we've been taught,
that Joseph gladly, willingly

38:01.838 --> 38:04.342
surrendered himself
to the state for a second time,

38:04.442 --> 38:06.347
I mean, it makes no sense.

38:06.380 --> 38:09.654
He was nearly executed
when he tried that before.

38:09.687 --> 38:11.792
So someone
must have convinced him

38:11.825 --> 38:13.995
to risk his life
in that way again.

38:24.684 --> 38:26.354
Give me the letter.

38:36.574 --> 38:38.010
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

38:39.781 --> 38:41.049
Joseph.

38:42.452 --> 38:44.390
I've been sent with a letter...

38:49.399 --> 38:50.969
From the prophet's wife.

38:51.972 --> 38:53.742
- Bless you, Brother.

38:55.546 --> 38:56.648
Oh, no, it's--

38:59.052 --> 39:00.656
In case you were found.

39:02.459 --> 39:07.903
- Only one living voice
had real power over -

39:08.003 --> 39:10.809
his first and truest love,

39:10.909 --> 39:13.816
she who knew his secrets.

39:13.849 --> 39:17.422
"Dear Joseph, you always said

39:17.523 --> 39:19.059
"if the church stuck by you,

39:19.159 --> 39:21.664
you would stick
by the church."

39:21.764 --> 39:25.471
- So one sentence,
just a few words,

39:25.572 --> 39:28.878
added to her letter,
put into her voice,

39:28.978 --> 39:34.055
"My sweet Joseph,
you must surrender now."

39:34.824 --> 39:37.129
"In order to save our church."

39:41.904 --> 39:43.876
- Brigham Young, Taylor

39:43.909 --> 39:46.981
already had
beehives' worth of wives.

39:47.081 --> 39:49.621
So do--do you think they would
risk losing them all

39:49.654 --> 39:51.625
for Emma's sake?

39:51.658 --> 39:52.960
For a woman
they likely feared

39:53.060 --> 39:56.166
already had
far too much power over Joseph?

39:59.607 --> 40:01.945
Or was this Brigham's chance

40:02.045 --> 40:04.583
to become the One,

40:04.683 --> 40:06.119
the sole leader...

40:13.134 --> 40:14.637
To take God's church
in the direction

40:14.670 --> 40:18.110
he felt it had to
in order to survive,

40:18.210 --> 40:20.750
even if that meant
our prophet's blood

40:20.783 --> 40:22.185
had to spill?

40:28.565 --> 40:29.834
Hang him!

40:44.196 --> 40:45.699
So...

40:45.799 --> 40:49.573
a School of the Prophets,
plural?

40:49.673 --> 40:51.945
No.

40:51.978 --> 40:54.182
There has only ever been one
at a time.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.257
So I wouldn't expect to find
more than one prophet

40:58.357 --> 41:00.663
still alive
on this farm of theirs.

41:18.230 --> 41:20.635
- You think your bishop
was working on your wife

41:20.735 --> 41:22.840
and kids last night?

41:22.873 --> 41:25.111
- Wouldn't surprise me if, uh,
they had the chief over

41:25.144 --> 41:27.984
for some homemade ice cream.

41:28.017 --> 41:30.087
Stake President
brought the sprinkles.

41:32.025 --> 41:34.029
Circling the wagons.

41:34.129 --> 41:37.703
- With your own family,
behind your back.

41:37.736 --> 41:39.874
To what, keep you in line?

41:42.145 --> 41:43.280
- Yeah.

41:43.380 --> 41:45.552
My best guess is that they,
um...

41:47.756 --> 41:50.729
Feel more--more comfortable
when they are writing

41:50.762 --> 41:52.098
the official story.

41:56.306 --> 41:59.279
Say, did, um, the church
ever tell you, your family

41:59.312 --> 42:02.920
or your school,
why Dan was excommunicated?

42:06.628 --> 42:08.866
- Uh, his anti-tax campaign,

42:08.899 --> 42:11.537
uh, running for sheriff.

42:11.637 --> 42:14.109
You know, he was just too--
too public for the church.

42:16.748 --> 42:18.050
Hmm.

42:23.862 --> 42:24.998
That's wrong.

42:25.031 --> 42:28.103
Dan was planning on, um,

42:28.203 --> 42:30.643
marrying his two stepdaughters

42:30.676 --> 42:33.014
by sexual consummation.

42:33.047 --> 42:35.585
12 and 14 years old.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.659
Ron know that, Mr. Brady?

42:38.692 --> 42:42.131
Well, i-if that's true, uh...

42:43.334 --> 42:45.572
No. Uh...

42:45.672 --> 42:48.578
he wouldn't have come
to Dan's defense for that.

42:49.914 --> 42:52.686
He went in
to defend Dan's politics.

42:52.786 --> 42:55.157
- It is the responsibility
of every saint

42:55.257 --> 42:57.361
to refuse the unjust taxations.

42:57.461 --> 42:58.898
That's all he was saying.

42:58.998 --> 43:01.203
I mean, Dan is a patriot.

43:01.236 --> 43:03.307
The very soil of this land
is in the fabric of his being.

43:03.340 --> 43:06.781
He's a patriot,
and for that, you...

43:06.814 --> 43:08.885
give him
the ultimate punishment?

43:08.985 --> 43:13.026
- You're going over territory
that we've already dealt with.

43:13.126 --> 43:16.099
Your brother's case
has no bearing on this.

43:16.199 --> 43:19.139
This hearing is yours.

43:19.239 --> 43:20.208
- It's mine?
- Yes.

43:20.241 --> 43:22.913
And its outcome will depend

43:23.013 --> 43:25.050
on your showing contrition...

43:25.150 --> 43:27.756
- Contrition?
- For your own offenses.

43:27.856 --> 43:29.292
- What offenses?
Well...

43:29.392 --> 43:31.230
- What offenses?
Foremost of them...

43:31.263 --> 43:32.098
- Yeah?

43:32.132 --> 43:34.637
- Is your threatening
your own bishop.

43:34.737 --> 43:39.947
And, yes, the other business
of violence in your home.

43:40.983 --> 43:43.655
Now, can you see

43:43.755 --> 43:48.064
that you have
violated His teaching

43:48.097 --> 43:52.171
when you have defied
your priesthood leader--

43:52.271 --> 43:53.942
- No, no, no, it is you.

43:55.846 --> 43:58.751
It's you who has...

43:58.851 --> 44:00.956
antagonized and bastardized
the sacred teachings

44:01.056 --> 44:02.091
of Joseph Smith
and Brigham Young.

44:02.191 --> 44:05.098
- Ron, don't do this.

44:05.131 --> 44:08.805
- It is you
who stink of hypocrisy.

44:11.243 --> 44:13.849
When the Lord commands,
you do it.

44:23.233 --> 44:25.237
It is the decision
of this council

44:25.337 --> 44:29.012
that you, Ron Lafferty,
be excommunicated.

44:29.045 --> 44:30.682
But know that with repentance

44:30.782 --> 44:33.186
comes the healing waters
of rebaptism.

44:35.024 --> 44:36.160
After his church court,

44:36.193 --> 44:38.230
he went home

44:38.330 --> 44:41.136
to reclaim his rightful place.

44:41.169 --> 44:42.873
- Everyone, go.
Hide. Hide.

44:42.906 --> 44:44.208
Hide.

44:46.814 --> 44:48.250
- Where you going?

44:50.822 --> 44:52.726
Oh, where are my beauties?

44:54.062 --> 44:55.999
Where are my beauties?

44:57.402 --> 45:00.275
You gonna give me a hug?

45:00.308 --> 45:01.844
You gonna give me a hug?

45:01.944 --> 45:03.113
Come give Daddy a hug.

45:03.213 --> 45:04.884
- No!
- Come here!

45:04.917 --> 45:06.053
Hey, where you going?

45:06.086 --> 45:08.758
Oh, my big boy. My big boy.

45:10.061 --> 45:11.964
Come here.

45:12.064 --> 45:14.002
His own daughter
had cut the sacred markings

45:14.102 --> 45:15.038
out of his garments.

45:15.071 --> 45:16.206
Give Daddy a kiss.

45:16.239 --> 45:17.743
Like, he lost everything:

45:17.843 --> 45:21.350
his business, his family,
his church.

45:21.383 --> 45:22.886
Where's--where's your sister?

45:22.986 --> 45:23.922
Huh?

45:30.101 --> 45:31.436
Are you up here?

45:31.537 --> 45:33.909
Are you hiding?

45:51.209 --> 45:54.951
And yes, Mr. Taba,
we can hear the Holy Spirit

45:54.984 --> 45:59.793
as true saints, but I-I-I
really worry that Ron...

46:00.829 --> 46:03.801
Came to believe that he could
hear a truer voice of God...

46:05.972 --> 46:07.341
His own God...

46:09.279 --> 46:11.250
Better than anyone else
could hear him.

46:41.042 --> 46:42.278
Pkew, pkew!

46:42.311 --> 46:44.517
Hey, partner. Hey.

46:44.550 --> 46:45.819
It's okay.

46:46.921 --> 46:47.956
Howdy, Sheriff.

46:49.159 --> 46:50.595
Don't shoot me.

46:50.695 --> 46:52.131
I'm not a bad guy.

46:54.169 --> 46:55.972
You know,
I think that you're ready.

47:07.128 --> 47:09.132
You know what that means?

47:16.312 --> 47:18.383
Let it be a reminder.

47:18.483 --> 47:22.358
Sometimes the closer we are
to the Heavenly Father,

47:22.458 --> 47:25.899
the more
we're gonna be persecuted.

47:30.975 --> 47:32.244
Okay?

47:41.530 --> 47:42.899
Okay.

47:46.072 --> 47:47.274
Okay.

48:11.022 --> 48:12.258
Clear.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.477
It's--it's all right.

48:55.578 --> 48:57.682
Police. We're here to help.

49:05.097 --> 49:07.101
It's all right.

49:07.201 --> 49:10.709
- They're Canadians,
from a place up in BC

49:10.742 --> 49:14.048
called Bountiful,
an FLDS compound.

49:15.050 --> 49:16.588
And who brought them down here?

49:16.621 --> 49:18.057
Prophet Onias.

49:18.090 --> 49:19.660
30 days ago.

49:19.760 --> 49:22.165
They said none of the men
have been back here for days.

49:22.198 --> 49:23.501
They left them here
with no food,

49:23.601 --> 49:24.670
no money to get back.

49:24.770 --> 49:26.173
- No running water,
no electricity.

49:26.206 --> 49:28.410
Heck of a prophet, this Onias.

49:28.511 --> 49:29.378
I need you to find him,

49:30.749 --> 49:32.151
- You bet.

49:36.059 --> 49:37.562
- Hi.

49:39.733 --> 49:41.169
You okay?

49:43.775 --> 49:45.077
It's--it's all right.

49:45.177 --> 49:47.014
You're not in--
you're not in trouble.

49:48.818 --> 49:50.588
I just need to know
the last time you saw

49:50.688 --> 49:52.224
Ron and Dan Lafferty.

49:54.797 --> 49:57.068
Do you know them?

49:57.101 --> 49:59.438
Did--did they stay here,
live here?

50:03.347 --> 50:05.150
They slept here.

50:06.486 --> 50:07.488
We don't know

50:24.155 --> 50:26.661
They told us
not to disturb that.

50:30.802 --> 50:32.171
Okay.

50:33.373 --> 50:34.510
It's okay.

51:15.692 --> 51:17.830
"This is unto
my maidservant Dianna.

51:17.863 --> 51:19.365
"Nevertheless,
if thou will repent,

51:19.465 --> 51:20.836
"I will greatly bless thee.

51:20.869 --> 51:22.505
Otherwise, I will remove thee."

51:22.605 --> 51:25.444
They are after Dianna.

51:25.477 --> 51:27.448
- If they haven't already
gotten to her.

51:30.789 --> 51:32.859
The list.
Mm.

51:36.734 --> 51:38.638
- Whose shirt is this?

51:38.738 --> 51:40.440
- Our Ron's.

51:41.877 --> 51:44.148
He left it here
to watch over us.

51:49.760 --> 51:51.697
Be right back with
some food, guys, all right?

51:51.797 --> 51:52.799
Just sit tight.

51:56.840 --> 52:00.214
I didn't lie, okay?
They--they were clearly there.

52:00.247 --> 52:01.617
I-I can't help it
if they left.

52:01.717 --> 52:03.219
And if I was to ask
those young ladies

52:03.319 --> 52:04.355
if you were ever there
with them?

52:04.455 --> 52:05.825
- No, no,
they'll say I never was.

52:05.925 --> 52:07.428
I only ever went
to the school

52:07.529 --> 52:09.332
when it was
at Ron and Dan's place.

52:09.365 --> 52:11.202
- You used to meet
at their parents' house?

52:11.302 --> 52:12.739
Yeah, f-for a little while.

52:12.839 --> 52:16.580
In the basement
and, uh, sometimes in the park.

52:16.680 --> 52:18.884
I mean, Dan's--Dan's mom
made sandwiches.

52:18.984 --> 52:20.622
It wasn't like this.

52:20.655 --> 52:23.694
It was...simple.

52:23.794 --> 52:25.732
- I'll get a search warrant.

52:29.272 --> 52:31.376
My--my brother...

52:32.946 --> 52:34.649
Couldn't have written this.

53:17.736 --> 53:19.606
Give us some space. Thanks.

53:24.448 --> 53:25.918
Everything okay?

53:26.018 --> 53:27.354
- Yeah, um...

53:28.390 --> 53:29.560
look, I-I couldn't say this
in front of Allen,

53:29.593 --> 53:30.695
not in the state
that he was in,

53:30.795 --> 53:33.701
but, uh, he's wrong.

53:33.801 --> 53:35.972
His brother Ron

53:36.005 --> 53:38.978
is capable of a lot more
than just domestic violence.

53:41.750 --> 53:44.455
We got the warrant.
We should go.

53:47.027 --> 53:48.631
Look, after his church court,

53:48.731 --> 53:51.571
after what he did
with his kids,

53:51.604 --> 53:53.808
he went home.

53:53.908 --> 53:55.645
Home to his mother.

54:02.024 --> 54:04.429
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!

54:04.462 --> 54:06.332
Stop it.
- I--

54:07.903 --> 54:11.743
I-I am a fraud of a man.

54:13.648 --> 54:16.319
No.

54:16.419 --> 54:17.856
You've come home...

54:19.927 --> 54:23.567
After surviving
all of the Lord's tests.

54:23.667 --> 54:27.842
And you're one heartbeat away
from your rightful place...

54:29.746 --> 54:31.750
As head of this family.

54:33.788 --> 54:36.627
You're the One.

54:41.135 --> 54:45.778
- She called him
the One Mighty and Strong.

54:47.849 --> 54:51.590
I think, in her words,

54:51.690 --> 54:55.731
he heard a calling to reclaim
his rightful place.

55:12.799 --> 55:14.034
Ronnie.

55:26.459 --> 55:28.062
Shh.

55:31.837 --> 55:33.941
Call Mother in.

55:36.580 --> 55:39.351
I need a--

55:39.451 --> 55:42.625
I need a doctor.

56:10.013 --> 56:12.952
- Remember Jacob's appendicitis
when he was young?

56:16.627 --> 56:18.129
Hmm? Do you?

56:19.900 --> 56:22.104
Or how you beat on Mom
like you beat on me?

56:25.043 --> 56:27.882
- Or when you beat our dog
Roger with a baseball bat

56:27.982 --> 56:30.821
'cause I didn't do the chores
to your satisfaction?

56:33.193 --> 56:34.028
- Yeah.

56:34.128 --> 56:38.604
- Your mind has been...
taken by evil.

56:38.637 --> 56:40.407
No, no, no.

56:41.777 --> 56:43.748
No, no, see,
I remember it clearly.

56:43.781 --> 56:46.019
And each time,
you said that...

56:46.052 --> 56:47.488
there was no need for a doctor

56:47.522 --> 56:49.492
if we were close
to Heavenly Father.

56:49.526 --> 56:50.628
Yes. Yes.

56:50.661 --> 56:52.164
And Mom survived.

56:52.197 --> 56:53.333
- Yes.

56:53.366 --> 56:55.871
And even when the bacteria
got into his bloodstream

56:55.971 --> 56:58.142
and stopped him
from breathing...

56:59.946 --> 57:02.652
Well, Jacob survived.

57:02.685 --> 57:05.490
All but his mind.

57:05.591 --> 57:07.194
But Roger,

57:07.227 --> 57:11.903
he died looking into my eyes
in incredible pain.

57:29.004 --> 57:30.206
- I am a dead man.

57:31.844 --> 57:36.820
I can't allow you
to go against your principles,

57:36.920 --> 57:40.227
not while it's your life that's
in Eternal Father's hands,

57:40.260 --> 57:41.763
can I?

57:41.863 --> 57:42.932
Clear!

57:51.950 --> 57:53.954
So there will be no doctor.

57:55.958 --> 57:58.229
Why don't you try and pray?

58:04.174 --> 58:06.580
- The business of patriarchy

58:06.613 --> 58:09.519
isn't as simple

58:09.619 --> 58:11.088
as you think.

58:12.291 --> 58:16.232
It won't be any easier for you
if I'm gone.

58:18.604 --> 58:20.106
- Yeah, maybe not.

58:21.242 --> 58:23.547
But there can be only one.

58:27.822 --> 58:29.726
You taught me that.

58:41.650 --> 58:42.885
- O Lord,

58:42.985 --> 58:44.221
my God--

59:05.330 --> 59:07.034
- No!

59:10.406 --> 59:12.779
- The traitor
Joseph Smith is dead!

59:22.932 --> 59:25.638
John! John!

59:30.079 --> 59:32.318
It's okay.

59:45.377 --> 59:48.818
The Savior has commanded me

59:48.851 --> 59:52.224
to defend His holy Word

59:52.257 --> 59:57.602
unclouded by faithlessness
or misinterpretation...

59:59.271 --> 1:00:04.683
To lead His holy people
to a new and greater Zion.

1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:12.097
The keys of the kingdom
are right here with the church.

1:00:15.003 --> 1:00:17.107
- The spirit of Joseph
is in him.

1:00:49.071 --> 1:00:50.407
How could you know all this?

1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:52.746
- Well, he told me

1:00:52.779 --> 1:00:53.881
himself, all of it.

1:00:56.452 --> 1:00:59.157
The proud new Lion of the Lord.

1:01:31.088 --> 1:01:33.192
Ron left that list
for us to find...

1:01:38.169 --> 1:01:39.906
Because he believes...

1:01:42.277 --> 1:01:46.787
Fully that he is the One...

1:01:49.257 --> 1:01:51.128
A new Lion of the Lord...

1:01:54.902 --> 1:01:56.807
A latter-day Brigham Young.

1:02:01.315 --> 1:02:03.920
- Then there'll be more blood.
