if you wished your mother

What would you like us to say?

00:20.421 --> 00:22.154

by saying,

00:22.156 --> 00:24.323
"happy anniversary."

You should've told us!

09:26.567 --> 09:28.066
We don't want to intrude.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.735
MOIRA: No, you're not intruding,
this is a surprise treat.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.905
- Oh, okay, well then,
are we intruding?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.774
Because before you were saying

09:35.776 --> 09:38.476
that you didn't wanna go
out tonight, so...

09:38.478 --> 09:40.478
- No, no, we-we uh...

09:40.480 --> 09:41.980
You can certainly join us,

09:41.982 --> 09:44.215
if you don't have
your own table.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.817
- We do, but that
would be great!

09:45.819 --> 09:48.320

09:48.322 --> 09:52.257

let's all sit at one table.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.787

it's so unique.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.155
Um, thank God you look
the way you do,

11:30.157 --> 11:32.624

12:36.857 --> 12:38.757
BEV: Hmm! Here's a funny story.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.225
- Oh, good.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.094
- On our way here,
we drove through a town...

12:43.096 --> 12:48.133
not a word of a lie, called...
"Schittstown!"

12:48.135 --> 12:50.902
- Oh! No, it was called,
"Schittsville!"

12:50.904 --> 12:52.837
- Schittsville! (Laughs)

12:52.839 --> 12:54.205
- And from the looks of it,

12:54.207 --> 12:56.207
the town was living up
to its name!

12:56.209 --> 12:58.977
- Let's not go for the
low-hanging fruit here, Don.

12:58.979 --> 13:02.080
Okay?
- No, these are funny jokes.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.082
Please continue, Don.

13:04.084 --> 13:08.887
- You see, Roland gets it!
(Chuckles)

13:11.358 --> 13:13.291

13:18.165 --> 13:19.764

more fun at this party

13:19.766 --> 13:21.966
than I thought I would.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.002
- How did you do it?

13:24.004 --> 13:26.004
- Well, I started
by drinking all four

13:26.006 --> 13:27.572
of those peach schnapps
that you left in my fridge--

13:27.574 --> 13:30.074
- No, I mean you seemed
so cool about everything

13:30.076 --> 13:34.312
after we broke up.
It was almost annoying.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.147
- Cool?

13:36.149 --> 13:38.983
Alexis, I couldn't stop crying.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.754
I was scaring all
the animals at work.

13:42.756 --> 13:47.225
But when I... had to go on our
honeymoon without you,

13:49.930 --> 13:51.596
the zip line instructor

13:51.598 --> 13:54.132
at the Los Passions Couples
Resort told me

13:54.134 --> 13:57.001
that I just gotta get
through it.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.806
Meaning my fear of heights,
which I did get through.

14:01.808 --> 14:05.577
But with you, it just...

14:05.579 --> 14:07.512
it took a little longer.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.850
- I'm sorry.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.985
- It's okay.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.157
Staff dance?

14:19.159 --> 14:20.758
- Yes!

14:29.769 --> 14:31.669
- Mmm!

14:31.671 --> 14:34.772
Hmm, I thought I was shame
eating in private.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.075
- What is shame eating?

14:37.077 --> 14:41.212
- I don't think we have enough
time for that tonight.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.114
- Are you looking for someone?

14:43.116 --> 14:44.816
- No, yeah, I mean, sorry,

14:44.818 --> 14:47.986
I'm just, I lost my friend
who should be around here

14:47.988 --> 14:50.188
somewhere um, watching this so.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.923
- Are you here with Stevie?

14:51.925 --> 14:54.125
- I am. Yeah.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.727
- Okay.
- Not here "with."

14:55.729 --> 14:58.062
No, we're not together,
I'm very much single, so.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.431
- You wanna get some air?

15:00.433 --> 15:02.367
- Yeah. Uh huh.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.668
Mm! Yeah.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.309
- Who do you have to kill
around here

15:11.311 --> 15:15.079
to get another bottle of this
undrinkable wine?

15:15.081 --> 15:17.148
- I think it's good.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.684
I ordered the one with
the highest alcohol content.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.686
- What do you do, Roland?

15:21.688 --> 15:25.189

15:43.877 --> 15:45.209
- We're just having fun, John.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.978
- And I thought we were
having fun, Bev,

15:46.980 --> 15:48.279
but you know what, we're not.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.782

15:50.784 --> 15:53.885
- No Don, here's the joke.

15:53.887 --> 15:57.088
The joke is I'm sitting here
in a half decent restaurant

15:57.090 --> 15:59.724
with my wife and our friends...

16:02.429 --> 16:06.097
and all you two have done
is complain about the food,

16:06.099 --> 16:08.800
and pretend that you didn't
leave us high and dry

16:08.802 --> 16:10.868
after we lost everything.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.370
- Oh, we're past all that now.

16:12.372 --> 16:15.873
- I'm not quite past it, Moira.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.743
You wrote us off, Don.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.979
Not a phone call,

more generous

16:30.824 --> 16:34.859

16:41.201 --> 16:44.402
they've invited us
to their parties,

16:44.404 --> 16:48.673
they even offered to take us
out to dinner tonight.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.408

16:50.410 --> 16:51.943

17:23.076 --> 17:25.209
