WEBVTT

00:11.554 --> 00:15.516
(low, mystical
instrumental music)

01:07.568 --> 01:10.780
(male voice speaks
foreign language)

01:10.821 --> 01:15.034
(low, tense music
with a quick beat)

01:54.740 --> 01:57.409
(sword whispers)

02:09.880 --> 02:14.093
(men exclaim)
(swords clang)

03:13.777 --> 03:14.528
- [Man With Tie] Kane.

03:14.570 --> 03:15.905
- What?

03:15.946 --> 03:17.489
- I thought we all agreed
not to show that option?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.074
- Hey, did we get
approval or not?

03:19.116 --> 03:21.243
- Yeah, but you tipped
off the old man.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.745
Again!

03:22.786 --> 03:24.538
- Marshall loved the scheme.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.957
Pretty sure Ed'll get over it.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.713
- You've gotta start
paying attention.

03:32.755 --> 03:35.049
There's a whole world in
there you're not seeing, man.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.675
- Sorry, Scott.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.053
Guess I'm too busy kicking butt.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.387
And carrying yours.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.431
- Well, while you're
kicking and carrying,

03:42.473 --> 03:43.724
I'm busy covering.

03:43.766 --> 03:45.142
Both of ours.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.936
Just remember that.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.938
- Relax.
(phone dials)

03:48.979 --> 03:50.731
Go manage something.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.191
(telephone rings)

03:52.232 --> 03:53.609
- Hello, you've reached Emi.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.945
Please leave a message, beep.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.906
- Hi Emi, this is Kane.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.660
I'm glad I got your voicemail.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.536
I don't know how to say
this, but I'm leaving you,

04:04.578 --> 04:05.871
and I want a divorce.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.873
- Hey, that's not
even a little funny.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.249
(laughs)

04:09.291 --> 04:10.834
- Well you asked for it.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.795
- [Emi] Maybe, but you're
the one who's gonna get it.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.797
- Oh, bring it on, baby.

04:14.838 --> 04:15.881
So is this a bad time?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.882
- No, it's perfect, my
11:00's running late.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.219
So, how did it go this morning?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.845
- They loved it, Marshall's
all over the scheme.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.682
- Oh, congratulations
honey, that's great!

04:24.723 --> 04:27.559
So how did Edward take it?

04:27.601 --> 04:28.769
- Ed's fine, he's
got a happy client.

04:28.811 --> 04:31.146
What else does he want?

04:31.188 --> 04:33.774
- Well, we should celebrate
tonight, let's go out.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.485
- Mmm, I can't,
I'm working late.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.779
But I can meet you at the
coffee shop in 15 minutes.

04:38.821 --> 04:39.822
- Well, I can't leave right now,

04:39.863 --> 04:41.740
but I'll meet you in
your lobby at one.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.950
- Okay, 1:00?

04:42.992 --> 04:43.909
- Okay, see you then.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.452
- All right, bye.

04:46.704 --> 04:49.957
(low instrumental music)

05:00.426 --> 05:03.637
(fire crackles softly)

05:31.832 --> 05:34.084
- [Kane] Wakey wakey, baby.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.596
- [Emi] What time is it?

05:45.637 --> 05:47.931
- What time is it?

05:47.973 --> 05:49.808
It's time for work.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.769
- Work, work.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.604
You're a slave, you know?

05:53.645 --> 05:56.065
- That's indentured servant.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.864
- I had the weirdest dream.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.368
You were laying on the ground.

06:08.410 --> 06:12.915
I knelt down and whispered
something in your ear.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.167
And then you got up.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.960
- Oh yeah?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.587
Then what happened?

06:18.629 --> 06:20.547
- Nothing, that was it.

06:22.508 --> 06:25.302
Hey do you dream in
Japanese or in English?

06:25.344 --> 06:26.678
- What?

06:26.720 --> 06:29.056
- [Emi] I don't know,
it's a fair question.

06:29.098 --> 06:30.224
- Emi, I was there
until I was eight,

06:30.265 --> 06:32.142
I barely remember anything.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.894
Hey where's my phone?

06:33.936 --> 06:36.939
- Come on, let's
take the day off.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.982
- We're reviewing the
ERR for Friday's call

06:39.024 --> 06:41.652
with Tobias Partners.

06:41.693 --> 06:42.945
Man, I hope Scott remembered

06:42.986 --> 06:44.321
to take care of the
Shade Study diagrams.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.490
He's been so edgy lately.

06:48.617 --> 06:49.827
Hey, you okay?

06:51.495 --> 06:54.414
- Oh yeah, I'm just
a little tired.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.292
- Are you sure?

06:57.334 --> 06:58.460
'Cause I can take the day
off if you want me to.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.295
- Oh, no no, I'm fine.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.006
See you tonight.

07:04.466 --> 07:05.717
- You're sure?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.302
- I'm sure.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.888
Come home when you can.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.265
- Okay.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.057
Love you.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.433
- Love you too.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.322
(grass crunches softly)

07:27.364 --> 07:31.160
(swelling instrumental music)

07:43.338 --> 07:45.507
- Hey man, got a sec?

07:45.549 --> 07:48.260
- Yeah, yeah I'll
be right there.

07:51.346 --> 07:55.225
Come on, Scott, what's
really eating you?

07:55.267 --> 07:57.019
(Scott sighs)

07:57.060 --> 07:59.855
- Edward was in
here this morning.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.608
- And?

08:04.568 --> 08:09.031
- I'm sorry, man, there's
no easy way to say this.

08:09.072 --> 08:12.492
(tense, dramatic music)

08:15.954 --> 08:18.540
(leaves rustle)

08:31.053 --> 08:32.804
- Who are you?

08:32.846 --> 08:34.681
Why did you attack me yesterday?

08:34.722 --> 08:37.183
(man chuckles)

08:40.187 --> 08:42.773
(leaves rustle)

08:47.027 --> 08:50.197
(foreboding music)

08:56.453 --> 08:58.455
- You are not my master.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.165
- I am.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.169
- No.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.420
That is a lie.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.840
- Are you sure?

09:11.134 --> 09:12.052
I know you.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.764
I know what you hunger for.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.355
Join me at my table.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.116
Do you refuse me!

09:58.807 --> 10:03.020
(swords clang)
(men grunt)

10:04.980 --> 10:07.774
(Ronin cries out)

10:15.282 --> 10:17.743
(fabric tears)

10:31.673 --> 10:35.302
(sad, mellow tonal music)

11:56.174 --> 11:58.427
(keys jingle)

11:58.468 --> 12:02.139
(door squeaks and closes)

12:11.189 --> 12:12.149
- Hey!

12:12.190 --> 12:14.192
What are you doing here?

12:15.861 --> 12:20.073
Oh, and thanks for the
flowers, gorgeous as always.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.411
What's a matter?

12:24.453 --> 12:26.580
Did something happen at work?

12:28.707 --> 12:30.584
- I was laid off today.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.838
- Oh my goodness.

12:35.672 --> 12:36.882
What happened?

12:38.800 --> 12:41.595
- Scott called me
into his office.

12:42.637 --> 12:45.015
It took two minutes.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.975
I didn't see it coming.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.728
- Was it Edward?

12:50.687 --> 12:52.189
- I'm sure of it.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.405
I'm sorry, Emi.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.282
- No, I'm not sorry.

13:05.911 --> 13:09.331
You've been wandering
for so long, Kane.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.584
This is for the best.

13:14.461 --> 13:18.673
(soft tonal music with
gentle acoustic guitar)

13:45.367 --> 13:46.409
- [Television Voiceover]
At least you got

13:46.451 --> 13:48.078
a good look at them, now
we know this about them.

13:48.119 --> 13:48.995
We know they drove
away in a red--

13:49.037 --> 13:52.749
(voice drowned out by music)

13:55.085 --> 13:58.588
The important thing
is that you're okay.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.090
I'm not gonna miss the silver.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.049
I'm gonna miss the--

14:01.091 --> 14:04.511
(voice drowned out by music)

14:05.804 --> 14:07.889
(grunts)

14:09.933 --> 14:12.060
(coughs)

14:24.781 --> 14:27.576
(birds chirp)

14:27.617 --> 14:31.162
- [Kane] (sighs) Aren't
you gonna go to work?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.081
- I called in sick.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.207
- Headaches again?

14:34.249 --> 14:36.167
- Oh, it's not so bad.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.004
I thought we could
hang out today.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.798
- You should just rest.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.383
- Well, I don't want to.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.845
Besides, it'll take
my mind off my mind.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.557
- All right.

14:50.599 --> 14:53.351
Can you pass the milk please?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.686
Thank you.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.646
- Also, I thought that,

14:57.981 --> 15:00.984
maybe we could visit
my friend Cary.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.486
- I knew you were gonna
bring this up again.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.614
Emi, just stop it, please.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.490
- I just thought we could talk.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.868
- I told you before, I left
that life when I was a kid.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.202
You can do whatever you want,

15:11.244 --> 15:12.871
but me, I'm gonna
do things my way.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.788
- Your way?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.665
- [Kane] Yes, Emi, my way.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.500
- You mean moping
around here for a month.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.002
Is that your grand
philosophy, Kane?

15:19.044 --> 15:21.129
Is that your way?

15:21.171 --> 15:25.383
- A month of loafing is better
than a lifetime of lies.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.727
(Kane sighs)

15:36.686 --> 15:38.521
When we die, we die.

15:41.399 --> 15:42.484
That's it, Emi.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.655
Man is alone.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.082
There is no Other.

15:59.501 --> 16:00.585
- Oh.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.670
- You all right?

16:01.711 --> 16:02.587
- I'm fine.

16:03.963 --> 16:04.756
Thank you.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.892
You are wrong, Kane.

16:18.019 --> 16:21.523
An ancient battle rages
within each of us.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.608
The prize is our soul.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.946
(haunting tonal music)

16:57.809 --> 17:00.145
- [Man] Mr. Madison I presume?

17:00.186 --> 17:01.521
- [Kane] Oh, Father Cary.

17:01.563 --> 17:02.647
- [Father Cary]
Nice to meet you.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.898
- [Kane] You too.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.568
- Really, no kidding?

17:06.608 --> 17:08.069
They served in Asia?

17:08.111 --> 17:10.905
- Yeah, all over, uh, really.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.824
China, Indonesia.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.032
I was actually born in Japan

17:14.075 --> 17:16.578
during one of their
last missions.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.579
They uh, they divorced

17:18.621 --> 17:21.583
a few years after we moved
back into the States.

17:21.624 --> 17:25.086
- So, you've seen
it all, I guess.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.171
(laughs)

17:26.212 --> 17:28.423
- No disrespect, Father, but,

17:28.464 --> 17:29.799
I kinda have, yeah.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.843
I'm really here for Emi.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.263
- Are you sure?

17:39.642 --> 17:42.270
(birds tweet)

17:47.817 --> 17:49.235
- Show yourself!

17:50.069 --> 17:51.571
- I am here, boy.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.367
What do you seek?

17:58.661 --> 18:00.079
- I seek a meal.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.584
- I would never have guessed.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.336
- What is it to you, old man?

18:06.377 --> 18:07.378
Why mock me?

18:08.296 --> 18:09.714
- I mock myself,

18:10.590 --> 18:14.552
for I constantly suffer
the likes of you.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.637
- Useless.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.390
(seated man sighs)

18:19.432 --> 18:23.019
- If a meal is your
desire, take this sword.

18:33.488 --> 18:37.575
Beneath the great tree,
you will find the Master.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.412
He will give you your fill.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.833
- I am my own master now.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.334
(seated man laughs)

18:46.376 --> 18:49.712
- And a fine job your
master is doing, young man.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.007
Do what you will.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.511
My charge is to inform,

18:58.179 --> 18:59.472
not to inspire.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.854
(metal whispers)

19:33.840 --> 19:36.342
(pills rattle)

19:38.845 --> 19:41.848
- You should really
get checked out.

19:41.890 --> 19:42.765
- I'm okay.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.313
- [Kane] Do you have
to take so many?

19:49.606 --> 19:52.191
- It's the only way I can sleep.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.279
So, what'd you do today?

19:58.740 --> 20:00.700
- I went for a drive.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.454
You know, I gotta take
that thing in again.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.289
I barely got it to start.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.666
- [Emi] So, where'd you go?

20:11.836 --> 20:13.254
- Nowhere special.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.923
Went up in Pasadena.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.675
- What, you just drove around?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.594
- Yeah, it was nice.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.262
I haven't been to
Old Town in a while.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.889
I went to go get a sandwich
at that place, Sammy's,

20:22.931 --> 20:23.765
you know they shut down?

20:23.806 --> 20:25.975
- Cary called this afternoon.

20:26.017 --> 20:28.937
Said he really
enjoyed your chat.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.190
- Don't make me do
that again, please.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.651
- Oh come on, he's a nice guy.

20:34.692 --> 20:35.944
- That's not the point.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.155
I went, I met with him,
I hope you're happy now.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.616
- I am so happy now.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.034
In fact, wow, my headache

20:43.076 --> 20:46.704
is completely gone all the
sudden, it's a miracle!

20:46.746 --> 20:48.122
- Yeah right.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.750
- Seriously, I feel much better.

20:51.834 --> 20:52.877
Thank you.

20:54.587 --> 20:58.591
- If that's all it took,
I'd be there every day.

20:59.884 --> 21:04.263
- All I want is to share this
part of my life with you.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.515
Won't you try?

21:07.016 --> 21:07.809
For me?

21:11.771 --> 21:14.774
(sighs)

21:14.816 --> 21:16.150
- Emi.

21:16.192 --> 21:16.985
Please.

21:19.821 --> 21:20.822
- I'm sorry.

23:18.356 --> 23:21.150
(low tonal music)

25:06.672 --> 25:09.050
(tense music)

25:37.954 --> 25:40.748
(man yells)
- Emi!

25:43.376 --> 25:44.168
Emi.

25:46.254 --> 25:48.130
(phone beeps)

25:48.172 --> 25:50.716
Yes, I have an emergency, I
need an ambulance immediately.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.635
I came home, my wife has
passed out on the floor.

25:52.677 --> 25:54.095
I have no idea what
happened to her,

25:54.136 --> 25:55.471
please just send somebody--

25:55.513 --> 25:59.308
(Kane drowned out by rising
music and steady beeping)

26:14.282 --> 26:17.076
- What are the
doctors saying now?

26:24.041 --> 26:26.919
- They think it
might be malignant.

26:32.466 --> 26:33.551
You must be tired
from your flight.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.802
Can I get you something to--

26:34.844 --> 26:37.263
- Leave me with my daughter.

27:00.786 --> 27:01.871
This is hope.

27:02.997 --> 27:03.748
My hope.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.794
Emi's and yours.

27:23.851 --> 27:24.935
- There is no Other.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.229
(soft music)

27:36.072 --> 27:37.656
For you, I will try.

27:40.368 --> 27:44.038
(gasps and breathes heavily)

28:12.274 --> 28:13.067
Old man.

28:15.069 --> 28:15.861
Old man!

28:22.785 --> 28:26.330
This Master, does
he pay with rice?

28:26.372 --> 28:29.458
- As I said, you
will have your fill.

28:30.668 --> 28:33.337
- What kind of men
is he looking for?

28:33.379 --> 28:34.213
- All manner.

28:36.674 --> 28:38.467
- So what is his name?

28:38.509 --> 28:40.344
- He has many names.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.888
- How far is this tree?

28:42.930 --> 28:45.224
- The road is different for all.

28:45.266 --> 28:49.562
- Stop it, speak plainly,
I do not understand!

28:49.603 --> 28:51.605
(sighs)

28:52.815 --> 28:54.525
- No one really does.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.654
- Then why try?

28:58.696 --> 28:59.488
- Fool!

29:01.407 --> 29:03.909
You hope there is more
than the wandering

29:03.951 --> 29:06.328
and the pain you know so well.

29:07.455 --> 29:10.291
You hope that my words are true,

29:10.332 --> 29:13.711
of a tree, a great
master, a full belly.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.968
You try, because you hope.

29:34.273 --> 29:37.359
Ronin, the Dark Lord
hunts you still.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.822
Beware, he is hungry too.

29:41.864 --> 29:43.574
Like a prowling lion.

30:11.936 --> 30:15.397
- That sword, does
it belong to you?

30:15.439 --> 30:17.358
- I suppose it does.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.109
The old man gave it to me.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.819
- (laughs) The old man?

30:20.861 --> 30:22.988
He's a Fool like me.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.448
- [Ronin] Perhaps.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.408
Aren't we all?

30:26.450 --> 30:28.035
- [Fool] True, true.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.412
So where are you going?

30:30.454 --> 30:31.622
- [Ronin] I'm not sure.

30:31.664 --> 30:35.084
- Well, two Fools are
always happier than one.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.669
Can I join you?

30:36.710 --> 30:38.128
- Thank you, no.

30:39.213 --> 30:40.589
- Are you sure?

30:40.631 --> 30:42.299
I can be very useful.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.262
I can be your bodyguard!

31:10.286 --> 31:14.373
(Kane speaks foreign language)

31:14.415 --> 31:17.459
- I don't know how
you eat this food.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.881
There's no substance.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.509
I'll be hungry again in an hour.

31:30.848 --> 31:32.558
- What happened to the flowers?

31:32.600 --> 31:35.394
- You needed to keep
them in the sun.

31:35.436 --> 31:37.563
That's where they belong.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.492
(sighs)

31:50.534 --> 31:51.744
No work today?

31:53.287 --> 31:56.624
- [Kane] No, I'm
going to the hospital.

31:58.584 --> 32:02.546
- You know, if you don't
like your job here,

32:02.588 --> 32:05.382
I'm sure my brother
could find work for you

32:05.424 --> 32:07.009
in our Osaka office.

32:08.469 --> 32:12.389
After all of this, Emi
needs to be with her family.

32:12.431 --> 32:15.267
With those who can care for her.

32:15.309 --> 32:16.518
- (Sighs) I knew it.

32:16.560 --> 32:20.189
- She needs to be
home, in her own bed,

32:20.230 --> 32:22.816
eating food that's good for her.

32:26.195 --> 32:29.531
I'm thinking of
what's best for Emi.

32:29.573 --> 32:32.660
She will be very
happy when she's home.

32:33.744 --> 32:36.163
I am sure you agree with me.

32:37.915 --> 32:39.041
- We're fine.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.585
Thank you, Mother.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.312
(papers rustle)

33:03.357 --> 33:05.317
(sighs)

33:31.552 --> 33:35.556
(twigs snap)
(phone rings)

33:39.226 --> 33:40.018
Hello?

33:41.770 --> 33:43.647
Yes, hi, how you doing?

33:45.649 --> 33:49.194
Uh yes, no, I know,
I know, I know.

33:49.236 --> 33:52.489
Well I was laid off a month ago.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.907
Unfortunately not.

33:55.826 --> 33:58.495
Yeah no, she was under
contract with her work,

33:58.537 --> 34:03.250
and they didn't provide
insurance so she was under mine.

34:03.292 --> 34:06.503
I'll email you everything
as soon as possible.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.630
Okay, yeah, I understand.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.132
Of course.

34:10.174 --> 34:11.507
Okay.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.136
Okay, thank you, all right, bye.

34:14.178 --> 34:15.179

35:03.811 --> 35:04.603
What?

35:05.646 --> 35:06.730
- Hello?

35:06.772 --> 35:08.398
Mr. Madison?

35:08.440 --> 35:10.526
Sorry, is this a bad time?

35:10.567 --> 35:11.860
- No, no, I'm sorry.

35:11.902 --> 35:14.446
I was expecting someone else.

35:15.697 --> 35:17.282
- Well, we were all
very, very saddened

35:17.324 --> 35:19.743
to hear about Emi's condition.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.203
- Thank you.

35:21.245 --> 35:23.664
Thank you for your
concern, I appreciate that.

35:23.705 --> 35:24.957
Hey, I'm sorry
about that just now.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.750
- Oh no, don't
worry about it Kane.

35:26.792 --> 35:29.711
I understand, you're in
the eye of the storm.

35:29.753 --> 35:31.547
- Thank you.

35:31.588 --> 35:34.550
- Now, has Emi's
condition improved any?

35:34.591 --> 35:35.926
(sighs)

35:35.968 --> 35:37.719
- No.

35:37.761 --> 35:38.637
Not really.

35:39.805 --> 35:40.681
The doctors aren't saying much

35:40.722 --> 35:43.600
until the test results come in.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.727
- How are you holding up?

35:47.104 --> 35:50.691
- I'm fine, just fine,
thanks for asking.

35:50.732 --> 35:53.443
- Well um, I hope
you don't mind, but,

35:53.485 --> 35:55.696
we've taken up a special
collection these past few weeks,

35:55.737 --> 35:57.489
uh, on your behalf.

35:57.531 --> 36:01.577
Now, it may not cover
everything, but it should help.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.829
- Thank you, I, I appreciate
that but really, we--

36:03.871 --> 36:06.665
- Emi told me about the
layoffs at your company

36:06.707 --> 36:09.501
just before she fell ill.

36:09.543 --> 36:11.795
Please Kane, let us help you.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.478
- Not bad, yes?

36:30.814 --> 36:31.607
Yes?

36:34.568 --> 36:35.569
- Thank you.

36:36.612 --> 36:38.238
- What was that

36:38.280 --> 36:39.072
I'm sorry.

36:40.407 --> 36:41.867
- I said thank you,

36:41.909 --> 36:44.786
very much for your
extraordinary assistance today.

36:44.828 --> 36:47.247
- Oh, don't mention it.

36:47.289 --> 36:48.790
It was nothing.

36:48.832 --> 36:49.875
Really.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.965
You don't know how
to use that, do you?

37:00.093 --> 37:03.138
Oh you never told me
where you're going.

37:03.180 --> 37:06.683
- The old man told me
to follow this path.

37:06.725 --> 37:11.438
- Oh, are you trying to find
the master beneath that tree?

37:11.480 --> 37:14.232
- I'm not looking for anything,
except something to eat.

37:14.274 --> 37:15.692
- Me too!

37:15.734 --> 37:17.277
I haven't eaten for days.

37:17.319 --> 37:18.820
Let me go with you.

37:22.824 --> 37:26.078
Oh come on, you see
how useful I can be!

37:26.119 --> 37:29.623
I will search for this
tree by your side.

37:33.126 --> 37:33.877
- Come on, then.

37:36.755 --> 37:40.968
(ethereal music)
(steady beeping)

37:53.105 --> 37:54.731
Yes, absolutely my friend.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.401
You won't be sorry that
you brought me along.

37:57.442 --> 38:00.946
Because I am very useful,
very useful indeed.

38:00.988 --> 38:03.532
You see, of all the
bodyguards in this world,

drowned out by music)

Great eyes, I can spot
your tree over a mile away.

Oh yes, absolutely my friend.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.507
Yes, you're a very, hey!

38:21.591 --> 38:22.384
Wait up!

38:24.970 --> 38:27.222
- Does this look right to you?

38:27.264 --> 38:29.850
Haven't we been this way before?

39:00.005 --> 39:01.840
I suppose that I'll see you

this afternoon, huh?

39:11.933 --> 39:14.895

- Ah, yes.

39:21.860 --> 39:22.986
Watch this.

39:26.323 --> 39:27.657
- How'd you do that?

39:27.699 --> 39:28.909
- I don't know.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.703
I have always been
able to do it.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.830
- You are indeed a useful one.

39:33.872 --> 39:37.751
- I can turn it blue,
you wanna see it?

39:37.793 --> 39:39.211
- No, no, please don't.

but it now sees that their
worst fears have been realized.

harder to see.

43:20.140 --> 43:21.099
- I can't see.

43:35.488 --> 43:36.906
Which way?

43:36.948 --> 43:38.033
We're surrounded.
- [News Announcer] Be the work

43:38.074 --> 43:39.451
of the second
fundamentalist faction.

43:39.492 --> 43:41.328
The blast ripped through a
crowded shopping district,

43:41.369 --> 43:42.912
killing 23--

43:42.954 --> 43:44.247
- [News Announcer] County
prosecutors filed new charges

43:44.289 --> 43:46.791
of child molestation against
the embattled reverend.

43:46.833 --> 43:48.084
(news announcer voices mingle)

43:48.126 --> 43:49.127
- [News Announcer]
Against gay marriage

43:49.169 --> 43:51.129
turned violent on Thursday.

43:51.171 --> 43:53.048
- [Kane] An experience
often unmediated

43:53.089 --> 43:56.051
by the structures of
traditional organized religion

43:56.092 --> 43:57.635
or the conditioned role-playing

43:57.677 --> 44:01.681
and learned defensive
behavior of the outer man.

44:02.682 --> 44:05.226
- [Emi] The prize is our soul.

44:07.979 --> 44:09.356
- We have no hope.

44:10.607 --> 44:14.402
- [Kane] For your name's
sake, preserve my life.

44:14.444 --> 44:18.156
In your unfailing love,
silence my enemies.

44:21.201 --> 44:24.120
(steady beeping)

44:40.303 --> 44:43.056
(archer yells)

44:50.188 --> 44:54.275
- I can not wait to get
to that tree of yours.

44:54.317 --> 44:57.570
I'm so hungry, I could
eat you my friend.

45:02.367 --> 45:05.078
- I have no memory of eating.

45:05.120 --> 45:06.955
(man laughs)

45:06.996 --> 45:10.542
- I too have forgotten
the warmth of a good meal.

45:10.583 --> 45:11.334
- No.

45:13.711 --> 45:16.131
I cannot remember
eating anything.

45:16.172 --> 45:16.965
Ever.

45:23.304 --> 45:27.517
I have forever wandered,
hunger my only companion.

45:32.939 --> 45:35.150
- Well, you've got me now.

45:38.778 --> 45:41.072
Go to bed you crazy person.

45:52.459 --> 45:55.336
(steady beeping)

46:13.646 --> 46:15.732
(snores)

46:25.950 --> 46:28.661
(sword whispers)

46:31.080 --> 46:33.750
(sword whooshes)

46:53.353 --> 46:55.688
- I brought you kaki fruit.

46:59.817 --> 47:02.278
What is it that you are reading?

47:02.320 --> 47:05.532
(dark, disturbing music)

47:10.328 --> 47:11.996
- It's one of Emi's books.

47:12.038 --> 47:14.999
- Why does she have this,
and why are you reading it?

47:15.041 --> 47:17.377
You told me you gave this up.

47:17.418 --> 47:19.170
- [Kane] I did, I have.

47:19.212 --> 47:20.421
- [Emi's Mother]
Don't lie to me.

47:20.463 --> 47:22.423
- I thought, maybe
it might help.

47:22.465 --> 47:24.133
- [Emi's Mother] Help what?

47:24.175 --> 47:26.261
This is all nonsense,
you know that.

47:26.302 --> 47:28.596
You told me yourself
only a year ago.

47:28.638 --> 47:29.514
- I know.

47:29.556 --> 47:30.932
I thought that maybe, I just--

47:30.974 --> 47:32.433
- Just what?

47:32.475 --> 47:34.435
I knew this would happen.

47:34.477 --> 47:37.272
I knew she shouldn't
have come here.

47:37.313 --> 47:39.315
I told her not to marry you.

47:39.357 --> 47:40.858
Useless.

47:40.900 --> 47:42.318
Unemployed.

47:42.360 --> 47:45.363
Even now you are
reading this foolishness

47:45.405 --> 47:47.574
instead of finding work.

47:47.615 --> 47:50.994
Just like your parents,
chasing fantasies.

47:51.035 --> 47:55.248
That book is the cause of
all the evil in this world.

48:04.007 --> 48:06.634
- Death no longer has mastery.

48:06.676 --> 48:09.512
Your daughter is not sick.

48:09.554 --> 48:12.181
To you, your daughter is dead.

48:13.516 --> 48:16.227
(swords clank)

48:21.190 --> 48:25.403
(arrow whooshes)
(grunts)

49:00.355 --> 49:02.732
(Fool snores)

49:03.983 --> 49:04.776
- Hey!

49:07.403 --> 49:08.613
What happened?

49:11.074 --> 49:13.534
Why didn't you call out for me?

49:14.452 --> 49:16.871
- You were sleeping so well.

49:19.040 --> 49:20.875
And you're gassy when
you don't get your sleep.

49:20.917 --> 49:22.377
- You should have called for me.

49:22.418 --> 49:25.505
I'm your bodyguard, remember?

49:25.546 --> 49:28.675
- I sing in the
shadow of your wings.

49:29.717 --> 49:31.719
Because you are my help.

49:33.638 --> 49:37.850
Those who seek my soul
will be destroyed.

49:37.892 --> 49:42.438
They will go down to
the depths of the earth.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.732
They shall fall by the sword.

49:46.526 --> 49:47.944
My soul thirsts,

49:50.905 --> 49:55.118
and I will be satisfied as
with the richest of foods.

49:55.952 --> 49:58.121
On my bed, I remember you.

50:01.165 --> 50:02.500
I think of you,

50:03.584 --> 50:05.294
because your love,

50:05.336 --> 50:06.921
(steady beeping)

50:06.963 --> 50:08.548
is better than life.

51:01.017 --> 51:01.809
- Look.

51:01.851 --> 51:02.602
Let's go!

51:02.643 --> 51:04.437
- Wait a moment.

51:04.479 --> 51:05.271
- What?

51:06.355 --> 51:08.191
- I don't know about this.

51:08.232 --> 51:10.443
- What I know is
that I'm starving.

51:10.485 --> 51:13.362
- No one leaves an orchard
like that unguarded.

51:13.404 --> 51:16.073
- You know, I hope we do
meet someone down there.

51:16.115 --> 51:17.950
'Cause I'm not sure
what I crave more,

51:17.992 --> 51:19.994
fruit or better company.

51:22.747 --> 51:24.040
Come on, you said it yourself,

51:24.081 --> 51:26.834
you can't remember
your last meal!

51:28.252 --> 51:29.545
- You go.

51:29.587 --> 51:32.131
Catch up with me when
you've had your fill.

51:32.173 --> 51:34.133
I don't like the look of this.

51:34.175 --> 51:35.551
It's off the path.

51:35.593 --> 51:38.137
- Look, I'll gather everything.

51:38.179 --> 51:39.972
Just wait by the edge.

51:42.517 --> 51:44.685
I can't carry it all myself!

51:53.236 --> 51:55.655
There you go, thank
you Sir Ronin!

51:55.696 --> 51:58.491
Make yourself
useful for a change.

52:04.163 --> 52:06.791
(phone rings)

52:09.710 --> 52:12.213
(sighs)
(phone beeps)

52:12.255 --> 52:13.464
- What do you want?

52:13.506 --> 52:15.383
- Well hello, nice
to hear from you too.

52:15.424 --> 52:17.426
- [Kane] Yeah, whatever.

52:18.219 --> 52:19.929
- I heard about Emi.

52:19.971 --> 52:21.764
I'm sorry, man.

52:21.806 --> 52:22.765
- Thank you.

52:22.807 --> 52:24.100
Now what do you really want?

52:24.141 --> 52:26.227
- Jeez, are you still blaming
the whole recession on me?

52:26.269 --> 52:27.895
- Oh, right.

52:27.937 --> 52:29.814
So that's what happened, huh?

52:29.856 --> 52:31.816
- Anyway, I got something
to make it up to you, man.

52:31.858 --> 52:34.402
You remember my old
college buddy over at RSDN?

52:34.443 --> 52:35.862
Well, we were having
lunch the other day

52:35.903 --> 52:37.822
and he mentioned
that they're looking

52:37.864 --> 52:39.615
for somebody who's
done federal work,

52:39.657 --> 52:41.492
knows BIM, and get this,

52:41.534 --> 52:43.828
just happens to know
English and Japanese.

52:43.870 --> 52:45.496
- [Kane] Come on, Scott.

52:45.538 --> 52:47.331
- [Scott] Don't worry, if
you can speak well enough

52:47.373 --> 52:48.916
to order dim sum you're good.

52:48.958 --> 52:50.167
- [Kane] What?

52:50.209 --> 52:51.794
- [Scott] So I say
to my buddy, "10%,"

52:51.836 --> 52:53.754
and he says, "10% of what
are you talking about?"

52:53.796 --> 52:56.215
And I say, "10% is
my finder's fee,

52:56.257 --> 52:58.759
"'cause I know just the guy."

53:02.054 --> 53:04.348
- [Ronin] Where did
that Fool run off to?

53:04.390 --> 53:06.893
(woman hums)

53:23.034 --> 53:25.036
(gasps)

53:25.077 --> 53:29.290
- Forgive me, Madam, I
didn't mean to frighten you.

53:31.709 --> 53:34.128
This is a beautiful orchard.

53:34.170 --> 53:36.589
Does your family tend to it?

53:41.052 --> 53:44.597
I'm sorry I bothered you, Madam.

53:44.639 --> 53:45.556
- My songs,

53:47.850 --> 53:50.853
my songs alone care
for these trees.

54:01.364 --> 54:03.866
(leaves rustle)

54:06.827 --> 54:07.954
Please.

54:07.995 --> 54:09.413
- No, thank you.

54:10.831 --> 54:12.625
I must be on my way.

54:12.667 --> 54:14.210
- For your journey, then.

54:14.251 --> 54:15.044
Oh!

54:16.837 --> 54:19.674
- Sit down, let me look at that.

54:21.592 --> 54:24.011
- [Madam] I'm sorry
to trouble you.

54:24.053 --> 54:26.430
- [Ronin] It's no
trouble at all.

54:26.472 --> 54:27.473
- Thank you.

54:30.685 --> 54:32.937
Where does your journey lead?

54:34.188 --> 54:35.815
- A fool's errand.

54:36.857 --> 54:38.943
It is of no importance.

54:38.985 --> 54:39.819
- Oh, please.

54:42.947 --> 54:44.949
- Well if you must know,

54:46.242 --> 54:50.329
I seek the tree which lies
at the end of that path.

54:50.371 --> 54:54.375
- I've heard of this tree,
and the Master there.

54:56.919 --> 54:59.547
A noble journey indeed.

54:59.588 --> 55:02.967
- We must be the poorest
nobles in the land.

55:03.009 --> 55:04.510
- [Madam] Please.

55:08.180 --> 55:10.933
- Oh absolutely, Joe-Joe's
is one of my favorite places.

55:10.975 --> 55:13.853
In fact, I proposed to
my first wife there.

55:13.894 --> 55:15.062
- Over Pastrami?

55:15.104 --> 55:16.439
- Yeah, had I chosen
a better place

55:16.480 --> 55:18.774
maybe it woulda lasted longer.

55:18.816 --> 55:20.401
- Who knows?

55:20.443 --> 55:21.902
- [Man] So uh, what about you?

55:21.944 --> 55:22.862
- What's that?

55:22.903 --> 55:24.989
- How long you been married?

55:25.031 --> 55:27.116
- Just over 10 months.

55:27.158 --> 55:28.409
- So has she started
giving you a hard time

55:28.451 --> 55:31.871
about working late
hours and all that?

55:31.912 --> 55:34.915
- No, she's pretty
understanding.

55:34.957 --> 55:36.542
- You're a lucky guy.

55:36.584 --> 55:37.501
Well the reason I stopped by

55:37.543 --> 55:38.627
is I wanna check
on your progress

55:38.669 --> 55:41.047
on the Tian Jin master plan.

55:41.088 --> 55:43.632
- Yeah, sure, I've got
a print right here.

55:43.674 --> 55:44.967
- Oh yeah, by the way,
you did a very nice job

55:45.009 --> 55:47.511
on the Miranda Center
curtain wall the other day.

55:47.553 --> 55:49.013
- Thank you.

55:49.055 --> 55:49.847
Okay.

55:54.310 --> 55:56.020
- Yeah, I knew it.

55:56.062 --> 55:58.147
This tower belongs
to the west side.

55:58.189 --> 56:00.524
Have you had a chance to
study the interior parcels?

56:00.566 --> 56:01.901
- Working on it.

56:01.942 --> 56:03.569
- Okay, well make sure you
have a lot of amenities.

56:03.611 --> 56:07.615
Entertainment, retail,
and a lot of public space.

56:07.656 --> 56:08.908
- Okay.

56:08.949 --> 56:12.411
- 'Cause the big idea
here, is the interior ring.

56:12.453 --> 56:13.245
- Okay.

56:14.205 --> 56:15.331
- Looks good.

56:16.582 --> 56:19.126
- Good enough for design review?

56:20.169 --> 56:22.797
(low music)

56:22.838 --> 56:24.090
- Absolutely.

56:24.131 --> 56:24.882
- Okay, thank you.

56:24.924 --> 56:25.966
- [Man] Yeah.

56:26.008 --> 56:29.637
(low, quick, tonal music)

56:53.577 --> 56:55.955
(phone rings)

57:44.044 --> 57:46.255
(groans)

57:46.297 --> 57:47.506
- Oh, my head.

57:50.050 --> 57:52.678
- You'll feel better tomorrow.

57:57.725 --> 57:58.642
- Tomorrow?

58:01.854 --> 58:04.940
Well how long have I been here?

58:04.982 --> 58:06.066
- A few nights.

58:07.443 --> 58:09.862
I have enjoyed your company.

58:12.531 --> 58:14.241
- Where is that Fool?

58:15.242 --> 58:17.244
Has anyone come looking for me?

58:17.286 --> 58:18.078
- No one.

58:24.668 --> 58:27.129
- Thank you for
your hospitality.

58:27.171 --> 58:28.756
I must leave.

58:28.797 --> 58:29.715
- Must you?

58:32.885 --> 58:34.970
- Where's my sword?

58:35.012 --> 58:37.181
- Where are you going again?

58:42.603 --> 58:44.939
You don't remember, do you?

58:47.066 --> 58:49.026
- Where's my sword?

58:49.068 --> 58:49.860
- Here.

58:53.322 --> 58:55.032
Take what you want.

59:03.624 --> 59:05.709
(coughs)

59:22.768 --> 59:23.978
- Here you go.

59:25.980 --> 59:27.564
- Oh, wait a minute.

59:29.817 --> 59:31.193
- What's up?

59:31.235 --> 59:34.154
- Did you draw this section
based on the survey?

59:34.196 --> 59:35.406
- No.

59:35.447 --> 59:38.409
Uh, I didn't really
think it was necessary.

59:38.450 --> 59:39.702
- What do you mean?

59:39.743 --> 59:41.328
- Well, the site
seemed pretty flat

59:41.370 --> 59:43.497
when we were out there, so...

59:43.539 --> 59:46.333
- There's a 12 foot grade
change from Davenport to 4th.

59:46.375 --> 59:47.084
- Really?

59:47.126 --> 59:48.002
- Yeah.

59:48.043 --> 59:49.295
Just because you don't see it

59:49.336 --> 59:50.546
doesn't mean that
it's not there.

59:50.587 --> 59:53.257
That is why you've
got to use the survey.

59:53.299 --> 59:55.092
- Okay.
(phone rings)

59:55.134 --> 59:59.096
All right, I'm sorry, I'll
re-draw it right after lunch.

01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:05.060
- This is Kane.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:06.895
Yeah, sure, I'll be right there.

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.188
All right.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:10.399
- Tell you what, kid,
you got the goods.

01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:12.234
You got the attitude,
but most of all,

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:13.777
you, you want it.

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:17.031
You're hungry.

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:20.200
You have absolutely
been a tremendous
asset to this company.

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:22.286
- That's great, I was hoping
things were working out.

01:00:22.328 --> 01:00:24.747
- Absolutely, that's
why we're talking.

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.165
Now you're aware that the GSA

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:28.959
is about to re-do a bunch
of their embassies, right?

01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:30.252
- Yeah, of course.

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:34.256
London, Tokyo, I think
a few others, right?

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:37.217
- I'm happy to say that we are
on the short list for Tokyo.

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:40.012
- Wow, that's great news.

01:00:40.054 --> 01:00:41.388
- It is great news.

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:44.183
I want it, I want it so bad!

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:47.353
That's one of the reasons
why we brought you on board.

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:48.729
- I'd love to help.

01:00:48.771 --> 01:00:50.064
- You are gonna do a
lot more than help.

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:52.816
I want you to lead the team

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:57.071
because I think that you are
the man to bring it home.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:01.075
Foster, Skidmore, Brighton.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:03.243
That's your old
stomping grounds, right?

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.161
- Mmhmm.

01:01:04.203 --> 01:01:05.329
- They're on the shortlist, too,

01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:06.663
but I think we got the edge.

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:08.957
You can detail a curtain
wall like nobody's business.

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:11.168
So I want you to have fun.

01:01:13.379 --> 01:01:16.673
Treat this just like
the Miranda Center.

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:18.092
You gotta love it.

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:22.179
High profile, high design,
big budget, big building.

01:01:23.472 --> 01:01:25.933
It's all yours, kid.

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:28.477
What do you think, kid, you in?

01:01:31.397 --> 01:01:32.189
- My wife.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.192
- Excuse me?

01:01:37.403 --> 01:01:38.821
- Absolutely.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:41.365
(Madam hums)

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:52.459
- Awake?

01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:57.172
- What's happening to me?

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:58.841
- Please.

01:01:58.882 --> 01:01:59.675
- No more.

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:05.264
(Ronin spits)
(Madam laughs)

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:06.265
- Such a baby!

01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:14.565
- Something is not right.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.193
I must leave this place.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:19.278
- Leave?

01:02:21.155 --> 01:02:22.030
- The tree.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.283
- Oh yes.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.660
Your noble journey.

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:30.038
Rest now.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:36.086
You are not the first to
lose his way along the road.

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:40.215
That tree does not exist.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:45.512
Only the foolish and the
weak hold to such things.

01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:50.309
There is no Master.

01:02:52.186 --> 01:02:53.562
There is no Other.

01:03:01.904 --> 01:03:03.906
(coughs)

01:03:07.326 --> 01:03:09.369
- Sorry, um, we finished
the options you asked for,

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:10.454
you wanna take a look now?

01:03:10.496 --> 01:03:11.288
- Okay.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.334
- Scheme A is pretty much
what we talked about.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.628
Scheme B has a wider entry
that relates to the site

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:18.420
that you can see
we'll reposition--

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:20.214
- What is this?

01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:21.465
- What is what?

01:03:21.507 --> 01:03:24.343
- Where is the compound
access control?

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:26.470
- That's here, and here.

01:03:26.512 --> 01:03:28.430
- No, no I don't think
you can split it up.

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:30.557
Isn't that SED guideline?

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:32.309
- Well, but it doesn't
fit in the shell

01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:33.894
if you put them together, so.

01:03:33.936 --> 01:03:35.521
- [Kane] Where did this
footprint come from?

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:37.898
- It's derived from the parti.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.441
- The parti?

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:41.401
From two weeks ago?

01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:42.778
Are you kidding me?

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.947
The program wasn't
even updated then!

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.323
(sighs)

01:03:46.365 --> 01:03:49.159
Look, do the space planning
based on the design guidelines

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:51.453
then start shaping the shell.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:52.871
The membrane looks great guys,

01:03:52.913 --> 01:03:56.333
but the form is meaningless
if the program doesn't work.

01:03:56.375 --> 01:03:57.918
What is this?

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.419
First year studio?

01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:01.547
- We just thought we had to
compensate for the changes--

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:02.965
- No, you were not thinking.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:07.010
(intense instrumental music)
(steady beeping)

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:11.306
(beeping slows)

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:27.489
(EKG beeps a flat, steady tone)

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:44.047
(footsteps run)

01:04:57.185 --> 01:05:00.063
(pants for breath)

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:25.565
- I am sorry, my friend.

01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:17.576
- Dearest Kane, I'm
writing this down

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:21.371
in case I don't have the
chance to tell you in person.

01:07:21.413 --> 01:07:23.957
I know now that we
walk different paths,

01:07:23.999 --> 01:07:27.502
and I will no longer
bother you with mine.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:31.047
I have shared the fruits
of my experience with you,

01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:33.759
and that has to be enough.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.053
For if you ever decide
to make this journey,

01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:39.556
you must do so on your own.

01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:42.392
You must strip away
all that holds you.

01:07:42.434 --> 01:07:45.228
Your family, your
past, your work,

01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:49.107
your mind, everything.

01:07:49.149 --> 01:07:49.941
Even me.

01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:54.613
Find what is great,
majestic, what is pure.

01:07:55.947 --> 01:08:00.368
And if you grasp even
a taste, do not let go.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.162
Do not give up.

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:05.665
For even a taste is a
banquet we will share,

01:08:05.707 --> 01:08:08.710
and it will be full,
and without tears.

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:13.256
Blessed are those who hunger
and thirst for righteousness,

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:15.300
for they will be filled.

01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:21.180
My hope is that
you will be filled.

01:08:21.223 --> 01:08:22.682
My love is yours regardless.

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:25.685
(ethereal music)

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:54.171
(woman whispers)

01:09:22.868 --> 01:09:26.121
(melodic female singing)

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:36.673
- Hey!

01:09:36.715 --> 01:09:38.258
I thought you were dead!

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.719
(Fool laughs)

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.136
- I was, you fool!

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.728
- So of course I went
back to her a few times.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:52.647
She was quite lovely, you know?

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.150
Each time she said
you left without me.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.736
Eventually I left as well.

01:09:57.777 --> 01:10:00.864
We should go back
and fix her good.

01:10:00.906 --> 01:10:01.865
- No.

01:10:01.907 --> 01:10:03.408
Doesn't matter now.

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:06.036
- Are you feeling all right?

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:07.787
- Yes, why?

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:08.830
- No reason.

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:15.253
- Oh, we must be close.

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:16.838
- Close?

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.089
Close to what?

01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:48.119
- There it is.

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.204
Can you see it?

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.664
There it is.

01:10:50.705 --> 01:10:52.499
I can't believe we found it.

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.792
There it is, see?

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.002
- It's just another tree.

01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:57.128
- No.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.630
No, no, no, that is it.

01:10:58.672 --> 01:10:59.839
That is the Great Tree.

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:00.882
- How do you know?

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:03.885
It doesn't look like
anything special to me.

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:06.680
- Well come on, let's find out.

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:08.682
- Wait a minute.

01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:10.433
Let's not rush in.

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:13.311
- Ah yes, you have some
experience with that.

01:11:13.353 --> 01:11:14.688
- Listen to me.

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:17.732
We don't know who or
what is down there.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:19.859
- Well you are my bodyguard.

01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:21.987
I have nothing to fear.

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:23.863
- I'm serious.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:25.865
Do not go down there.

01:11:27.701 --> 01:11:28.994
- What is this?

01:11:36.543 --> 01:11:37.794
- Do you really
think that anyone

01:11:37.836 --> 01:11:40.964
waits for you beneath the tree?

01:11:41.006 --> 01:11:44.134
A great master,
freely bearing food,

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:46.970
drink, and shelter
to all who ask?

01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:52.517
If he were there,

01:11:52.559 --> 01:11:56.271
would not hunger and bloodshed
cease to plague this land?

01:11:56.312 --> 01:12:00.525
Would not the world flock
to him and call him Master?

01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:06.906
Enough with this foolishness.

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:10.660
You have embarrassed
me for the last time.

01:12:10.702 --> 01:12:14.914
(thunder rumbles)
(dark, dramatic music)

01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:22.338
- I was wondering when you
were gonna show up again.

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.635
I am honored,

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:31.431
that the Dark Lord
himself would seek me out.

01:12:34.059 --> 01:12:36.936
(Dark Lord laughs)

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.573
- Do you think my lord

01:12:49.991 --> 01:12:52.368
would waste his time on you?

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:55.038
(tense music)

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:05.340
(sword sings)

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:09.219
I am your greatest enemy.

01:13:12.013 --> 01:13:14.015
Your thoughts and fears.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.561
I am your memory.

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:20.980
Your mind, logos.

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.942
Call me what you will, I am you!

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:27.070
(quick, tense music)

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:37.288
And I battle all,

01:13:40.375 --> 01:13:42.085
who seek that tree.

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:54.055
(yells)

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:56.850
(swords clang)

01:13:59.978 --> 01:14:02.355
(phone rings)

01:14:06.985 --> 01:14:07.986
(glass shatters)

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:10.488
(swords clang)

01:14:14.284 --> 01:14:16.786
(Kane yells)

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:25.461
(men grunt)

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:49.944
You see?

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.988
I told you.

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:55.533
There is no one here.

01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:58.077
I knew it, I knew it all along.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:12.300
You fool.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:16.054
What a waste.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.140
Your hope is a lie!

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:26.981
There is no Master.

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:31.110
There is no Other!

01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:33.821
- No!

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:34.739
No, please!

01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:38.117
Ah!

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:40.870
(flames crackle)

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:53.174
(Dark Lord laughs)

01:16:09.691 --> 01:16:12.360
(flames crackle)

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:25.748
(Dark Lord cries out repeatedly)

01:16:42.432 --> 01:16:45.977
(ethereal strings music)

01:17:53.211 --> 01:17:56.214
(light tonal music)

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:41.175
You alone are my Master.

01:18:45.096 --> 01:18:46.472
There is no other.

01:18:49.142 --> 01:18:51.936
(breathes deeply)

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:24.177
That's great, great, fantastic.

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:26.679
I'll see you on the 12th?

01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:29.182
Right, the 12th, got it.

01:19:29.223 --> 01:19:32.518
Listen, thank you,
so much Father Cary.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.188
