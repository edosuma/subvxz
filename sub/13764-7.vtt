WEBVTT

00:03.766 --> 00:05.504
This car is disgusting.

00:05.590 --> 00:06.705
So get out.

00:06.791 --> 00:08.658
Staking out a technical college.

00:08.723 --> 00:11.126
All my ambitions fulfilled.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.808
Two arrests for
possession of cocaine,

00:13.873 --> 00:15.997
both of them students in that tech.

00:16.062 --> 00:18.058
I want to know who's dealing.

00:18.872 --> 00:22.049
And we're not leaving this
to the drugs squad because...?

00:22.135 --> 00:27.242
DI Robinson made a pass at
the guv's wife last Bonfire Night.

00:27.950 --> 00:30.525
I won't have drugs on my patch!

00:30.890 --> 00:33.530
Chris and that plonk better
be flushing that scum out.

00:33.573 --> 00:35.204
Her name's Annie.

00:36.095 --> 00:37.417
What the...

00:39.409 --> 00:41.362
You have got to be joking.

00:42.392 --> 00:44.858
Trudy were asking if I'd seen them.

00:45.014 --> 00:45.974
Guv!

00:47.086 --> 00:48.456
Go go go!

00:50.688 --> 00:51.726
C'mon!

00:57.775 --> 00:59.243
You'll pay for that.

00:59.341 --> 01:00.789
It's bloody shitty!

01:03.041 --> 01:05.292
- I'm on him!
- Get that cleared up!

01:05.331 --> 01:06.916
He's the dealer!

01:13.336 --> 01:14.785
Stop! Police!

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.533 --> 01:29.745
How's that for a truncheon?

01:35.849 --> 01:37.454
Oh, bollocks.

01:38.002 --> 01:39.960
My thoughts exactly.

01:43.367 --> 01:45.324
How are you, Billy-boy?

01:45.403 --> 01:47.027
Long time, no see.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.939
<i>My name is Sam Tyler.</i>

01:53.135 --> 01:56.149
<i>I had an accident
and I woke up in 1973.</i>

01:56.209 --> 01:59.674
<i>Am i mad? In a coma?
Or back in time?</i>

01:59.811 --> 02:03.178
<i>Whatever's happened, it's like
I've landed on a different planet.</i>

02:03.334 --> 02:06.642
<i>Now maybe if I can work out
a reason, I can get home.</i>

02:51.276 --> 02:53.429
He's a druggie.
Just charge the bugger.

02:53.561 --> 02:55.577
He was only carrying three wraps.

02:55.662 --> 02:57.654
He's no more than
a recreational user.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.045
Recreational?

02:59.170 --> 03:01.150
It's cocaine, not Subbuteo.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.492
Every user has a supplier.

03:03.655 --> 03:07.163
If we trace the line of supply,
we find the source.

03:07.251 --> 03:08.817
This is a golden opportunity.

03:09.005 --> 03:12.275
You're never happy unless you're
making my life complicated, are you?

03:12.426 --> 03:15.620
Play this right and Billy Kemble
can lead us to a much bigger collar.

03:15.721 --> 03:18.464
How'd that be for sticking
it to your mate in the drugs squad?

03:20.244 --> 03:21.835
How are you, Billy-boy?

03:21.986 --> 03:23.389
I want a solicitor.

03:23.439 --> 03:26.935
I want Fiona Richmond as a secretary,
looks like we'll both have to wait.

03:27.097 --> 03:28.350
Where'd you get it?

03:28.551 --> 03:29.553
Get what?

03:30.818 --> 03:32.684
- What are they?
- Come on Billy.

03:32.798 --> 03:35.509
Flashing at young mothers
is your vice, not drugs.

03:35.578 --> 03:37.511
Tell us who gave it you
and we can all be home

03:37.568 --> 03:39.500
in time to watch
The High Chapparal.

03:40.393 --> 03:41.900
I've got nowt to say.

03:43.642 --> 03:48.595
Sixty seconds to confess or get charged
with assault on a police officer.

03:49.065 --> 03:51.767
A monkey could have got
a confession out of Billy Kemble.

03:52.021 --> 03:55.525
Mike Tyson wades in and
now he's refusing to say a word.

03:55.604 --> 03:57.151
Mike who?

03:57.366 --> 03:58.599
Are we keeping you up?

03:58.697 --> 04:01.810
You will be. Every cell's full
and Harry Smith's phoned in sick.

04:01.888 --> 04:04.030
Muggins here's covering
and I'm knackered.

04:04.070 --> 04:07.350
Serves you right for staying up rutting
all night with that new fella of yours.

04:07.430 --> 04:08.753
Do you let his guide dog watch?

04:08.813 --> 04:10.988
His guide dog's
giving your mam one.

04:11.058 --> 04:12.221
From behind.

04:12.532 --> 04:14.927
Whatever happened
to all the classy birds?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.564
What are you doing?

04:16.902 --> 04:18.636
I'm gonna get a name from Kemble.

04:20.110 --> 04:21.743
Here we go!

04:25.105 --> 04:25.867
No.

04:29.224 --> 04:33.384
Half an hour in there and Kemble
will be talking nineteen to the dozen.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.148
You're having a guest, Albert.

04:35.249 --> 04:37.063
I'm not sharing with no one.

04:37.133 --> 04:38.536
What is that, a double negative?

04:38.586 --> 04:40.841
Don't they teach you anything
in nutter school ?

04:40.892 --> 04:44.230
I get out of here, the first
thing I'll do is knife your missus.

04:44.289 --> 04:46.214
Oh, shut up and share nicely.

04:47.547 --> 04:48.239
Come on.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.895
Shut up and get in there.

04:54.773 --> 04:56.497
I'm not going in there.

04:56.617 --> 04:58.331
- Guv....
- Come on, get out the way.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.574
You can't do this.

04:59.613 --> 05:02.129
Call DI Carling when you're
ready to name your source.

05:02.249 --> 05:04.304
Squeal piggy, squeal!

05:06.880 --> 05:08.624
- <i>Deliverance</i>.
- I know.

05:08.764 --> 05:09.626
Please!

05:11.962 --> 05:13.786
Right, I'm leaving you in charge.

05:13.857 --> 05:14.649
Me?

05:15.220 --> 05:15.932
What?

05:16.443 --> 05:17.756
Chris, you stay and help.

05:17.836 --> 05:22.196
DI Tyler and myself have to
discuss drugs policy and procedure.

05:22.357 --> 05:23.741
So he's buying me dinner.

05:23.831 --> 05:25.865
You want to discuss procedure?

05:25.905 --> 05:27.780
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

05:27.941 --> 05:31.118
I'll expect you to have
the name of Kemble's supplier.

05:31.268 --> 05:32.471
Think you can manage that?

05:32.561 --> 05:34.495
Yes, guv. Thanks guv.

05:35.628 --> 05:36.389
Right.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.795
I fancy something
a little bit different.

05:41.111 --> 05:42.805
When I said 'different',

05:43.175 --> 05:45.330
I meant maybe a Berni Inn.

05:46.874 --> 05:48.868
Why have we come
to Rusholme for a curry?

05:48.909 --> 05:51.214
The Taj Mahal's only round
the corner from the station.

05:51.324 --> 05:53.168
This is the real deal.

05:54.181 --> 05:56.727
Mind you, it looked a bit
different last time I was here.

05:59.211 --> 06:00.705
Here you are, this'll do.

06:05.565 --> 06:06.908
<i>Is he responding?</i>

06:18.057 --> 06:19.530
Where the hell are you going?

06:23.766 --> 06:26.312
- I thought I saw...
- Are we eating or what?

06:42.320 --> 06:45.227
So, you said you wanted
to talk about procedure.

06:45.876 --> 06:47.289
Oh. No no no no no.

06:48.060 --> 06:51.117
The missus is staying with
her mother. I don't eat alone.

06:52.410 --> 06:54.625
Well, if I told you that,
I knew you wouldn't come.

06:57.081 --> 07:01.030
So, how come you're such
an expert on all this drugs stuff?

07:01.962 --> 07:05.400
Most of my cases in
Hyde were drugs related.

07:06.031 --> 07:09.970
The users start off casual,
then the addiction spirals...

07:10.191 --> 07:12.727
and they end up funding
their habit through crime.

07:12.820 --> 07:15.600
- So bang up the users.
- It's like pissing in the wind.

07:15.678 --> 07:16.780
It's all about the supply.

07:16.855 --> 07:20.138
You cut the supply,
you cut the number of users.

07:21.478 --> 07:23.445
What's wrong with that radio?

07:23.607 --> 07:25.073
Sounds alright to me.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.045
That's Pulp.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.538
Tastes like spinach.

07:33.626 --> 07:34.678
That's Pulp.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.405
I saw them play the Nynex, 96.

07:39.643 --> 07:44.204
<i>The way Sam responds to these
sensory tests will be crucial.</i>

07:45.068 --> 07:46.446
I haven't finished yet.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.423
<i>Sam.</i>

07:47.812 --> 07:49.766
They said my name on the radio.

07:50.305 --> 07:52.059
What, you got a dedication?

07:52.573 --> 07:55.617
- <i>Sam.</i>
- You must have heard that!

07:57.935 --> 07:58.725
Right.

08:01.656 --> 08:03.122
Should be getting back.

08:03.748 --> 08:05.953
See if Billy Kemble's coughed.

08:09.582 --> 08:11.336
Sam, c'mon.

08:22.915 --> 08:24.390
No Phyllis?

08:27.913 --> 08:31.142
What the hell is going on?
Why is nobody out...

08:34.759 --> 08:37.227
Won't be hearing
any more from this chap.

08:46.409 --> 08:48.629
When did you last
check on Billy Kemble?

08:49.840 --> 08:53.565
You should have conducted
half-hourly welfare checks.

08:53.705 --> 08:56.313
We did check on him.
That's how we knew he was dead.

08:56.406 --> 08:59.154
All the signs are it
was a massive coronary.

08:59.246 --> 09:01.140
What brought it
on's another matter.

09:01.233 --> 09:04.809
Bruising to the neck, torn
clothing and a cut on his face.

09:05.216 --> 09:08.147
I'll be interested to hear what
your post-mortem makes of that.

09:08.357 --> 09:09.215
Good night.

09:13.267 --> 09:15.041
Right, where's Collins now?

09:15.085 --> 09:16.350
He's in number three.

09:16.535 --> 09:18.976
- Did he attack Kemble?
- They weren't in the same cell.

09:19.015 --> 09:20.922
Did he attack Kemble?!

09:22.655 --> 09:23.336
Yes.

09:24.805 --> 09:27.927
But we moved Kemble out soon
as we released out of the others.

09:29.140 --> 09:31.715
This stays within CID, understand?

09:33.069 --> 09:35.612
Right, we have to get
a confession out of Collins.

09:44.189 --> 09:46.726
Billy Kemble was put
in your cell right as rain.

09:46.767 --> 09:49.980
A few hours later he's covered
in injuries and stiff as a board.

09:50.012 --> 09:52.485
I told you what'd happen
if you put him in with me.

09:52.567 --> 09:54.838
I'm not the one who should
be examining my conscience.

09:54.870 --> 09:56.673
What happened in there?

09:56.705 --> 09:59.647
He wanted the bed.
I told him it was mine.

09:59.723 --> 10:01.298
There was a little
rough and tumble.

10:01.361 --> 10:04.297
Yeah, well, that little rough and
tumble brought on a heart attack.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.682
For a couple of slaps?

10:05.815 --> 10:08.124
Maybe if it was you,
you lardy bastard.

10:08.206 --> 10:10.952
The lad was fine when
they let him out of my cell.

10:11.071 --> 10:14.474
'Course, what you lot did
to him after, who can say?

10:16.625 --> 10:19.730
Please do not question
the integrity of my officers.

10:19.807 --> 10:21.784
You'll give me indigestion.

10:21.891 --> 10:24.949
So, we just surrendered the
moral high ground to a psychopath.

10:25.026 --> 10:26.540
Good nights work.

10:29.304 --> 10:31.605
We all stick together on this.

10:34.076 --> 10:35.142
You okay?

10:36.239 --> 10:37.721
You look a bit...

10:38.293 --> 10:40.316
shaky, guv.

10:43.173 --> 10:45.289
Curry doesn't agree with me.

10:51.275 --> 10:55.476
Billy Kemble was a flasher,
caught in possession of cocaine.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.121
He was beaten up by a nutter

10:59.276 --> 11:01.484
who should have been
put away years ago.

11:01.561 --> 11:04.032
One scumbag offed another.

11:06.056 --> 11:09.299
It's bad luck he did it downstairs,
but these things happen.

11:10.272 --> 11:12.573
Once the post-mortem has been done,

11:12.650 --> 11:14.643
we'll nail a confession
from Albert Collins.

11:14.704 --> 11:17.639
In the meantime, you get your
statements written up and in to me.

11:17.994 --> 11:19.492
Keep them simple.

11:21.206 --> 11:22.735
No cause for fretting.

11:41.882 --> 11:43.040
Annie...

11:45.527 --> 11:46.978
I'm fine.

12:00.665 --> 12:03.183
It's not your fault.

12:07.090 --> 12:08.187
What?

12:08.310 --> 12:12.341
Just because you were on duty.
You're not to blame.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.720
I know.

12:19.454 --> 12:21.322
What I mean is,

12:21.431 --> 12:23.624
something like this,

12:23.701 --> 12:26.619
post-traumatic stress can cause...

12:26.975 --> 12:29.415
shock... or... guilt.

12:29.847 --> 12:31.639
What are you talking about?

12:31.731 --> 12:34.604
The situation tonight
should never have happened.

12:35.468 --> 12:37.754
So why did you let them
put him in that cell?

12:37.847 --> 12:38.635
Me?

12:38.727 --> 12:41.414
You should have all
just left him alone.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.889
Lovers' tiff?

12:44.982 --> 12:46.372
Piss off.

12:48.481 --> 12:49.423
Right.

12:50.427 --> 12:54.366
Kemble's body needs identifying
before we can do a post-mortem.

12:54.489 --> 12:58.150
First thing, fetch the next of kin,
tell them the bare minimum.

12:58.241 --> 13:01.284
Just make sure they know
it were your idea

13:01.423 --> 13:03.446
to keep him in for the night.

13:04.913 --> 13:07.075
Is that how this is gonna work?

13:07.987 --> 13:10.597
Keep the facts
as quiet as possible?

13:11.554 --> 13:12.620
Look.

13:13.161 --> 13:15.014
It's been a long night

13:15.153 --> 13:18.875
and now is not the time
to test my patience.

13:39.029 --> 13:40.364
Mind the step.

13:40.472 --> 13:42.588
Don't want the
other hip giving way.

13:42.820 --> 13:45.136
Right, bye Mrs Willain.

13:45.213 --> 13:47.963
Hope she trips. She's never happy
unless someone else is suffering.

13:48.024 --> 13:50.727
You 9.30? Come on, I'll be behind.

13:53.008 --> 13:56.066
So, who normally does your hair?
The council?

13:56.467 --> 13:58.074
Are you Andrea Kemble?

13:58.213 --> 14:01.101
I hope so.
Else I'm in another bugger's flat.

14:01.224 --> 14:03.062
You've no chance
of a David Cassidy.

14:03.124 --> 14:04.668
It'll have to be a Paul Newman.

14:04.915 --> 14:06.985
Detective Inspector Sam Tyler.

14:08.251 --> 14:11.200
Haven't you lot got
better things to do?

14:11.401 --> 14:14.336
Go on then.
Who's he flashed this time?

14:14.537 --> 14:16.930
- Can we sit down?
- No. I've a 9.30 due.

14:16.992 --> 14:19.077
Just tell me what our Billy's done.

14:20.452 --> 14:22.598
Billy... died.

14:23.032 --> 14:25.070
During the night.

14:25.302 --> 14:26.923
No he didn't.

14:27.109 --> 14:28.699
He was in police custody.

14:28.777 --> 14:30.985
I..I just saw him yesterday.

14:31.186 --> 14:33.534
It happened in the
early hours of the morning.

14:33.704 --> 14:36.916
It must be another Kemble.
You've got it mixed up.

14:37.349 --> 14:38.553
I'm sorry.

14:49.659 --> 14:50.749
How?

14:50.846 --> 14:53.919
We need somebody to identify
the body. Was he married or...?

14:53.977 --> 14:55.475
Just me.

14:57.711 --> 14:59.403
My baby brother.

15:04.110 --> 15:05.880
That's Billy.

15:08.914 --> 15:10.450
What's that?

15:11.112 --> 15:12.804
He's bruised.

15:16.091 --> 15:19.144
There was an altercation
in the cells.

15:19.261 --> 15:22.450
There was a fight
with another prisoner.

15:22.554 --> 15:24.635
That's how he died?

15:25.451 --> 15:28.485
The coroner will determine
the exact cause of death.

15:28.582 --> 15:30.566
Alright. I see.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.503
Thank you, Detective Inspector.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.334
We've still to verify
the exact chain of events.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.115
But everything seems to
have been done in accordance

15:40.154 --> 15:42.118
with the correct
procedural guidelines.

15:42.196 --> 15:45.872
Of course.
I'm sure you've been very thorough.

15:48.130 --> 15:50.639
Is that all I have to do?

15:54.976 --> 15:56.007
Look...

15:57.796 --> 16:00.188
Is there anything else
you want to know?

16:00.305 --> 16:02.405
Don't you want to ask anything?

16:03.922 --> 16:06.704
I'm sorry we've caused you
this much trouble.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.174
I won't take up
any more of your time.

16:09.291 --> 16:10.653
Miss Kemble.

16:11.586 --> 16:12.539
I...

16:14.037 --> 16:15.106
We...

16:16.312 --> 16:21.214
didn't see any real danger,
putting him in that cell.

16:21.428 --> 16:24.073
I'm sure you did what was right.

16:25.045 --> 16:27.632
He shouldn't have
got himself in here.

16:29.032 --> 16:31.191
If there was any negligence,

16:32.105 --> 16:33.934
it will be investigated.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.579
I think I can trust the police.

16:48.468 --> 16:51.872
Soon as we get the post-mortem results,
we'll take another pop at Collins,

16:51.930 --> 16:53.058
I want that confession.

16:53.117 --> 16:55.509
Who's gonna take a pop at us?

16:55.626 --> 16:56.695
Not with you.

16:56.753 --> 16:59.690
We put Billy Kemble in that cell.

17:00.332 --> 17:03.016
You chose Collins
to be his cellmate,

17:03.094 --> 17:05.000
I stood by and watched.

17:05.136 --> 17:07.118
Kemble had drugs on him.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.834
If he'd been clean, we'd never
have had to put him in that cell.

17:11.300 --> 17:14.003
And that absolves us, does it?

17:15.631 --> 17:17.382
We didn't smack him about.

17:17.460 --> 17:21.213
But you knew Collins might. That
was the whole point, wasn't it?

17:21.290 --> 17:25.473
Now is not the time to be having
a one-night stand with your conscience.

17:25.784 --> 17:29.158
You were wetting your pants about
getting a confession out of Kemble.

17:29.217 --> 17:30.617
You knew the score.

17:30.676 --> 17:32.757
Where were you when Kemble
was being knocked about?

17:32.835 --> 17:36.764
That's right, you were stuffing down
a curry at Gunga Din's in Rusholme.

17:41.528 --> 17:45.476
Now you understand how
we all need to stick together.

17:47.187 --> 17:49.657
Staff training a la Gene Hunt?

17:50.221 --> 17:51.777
Superintendant.

17:51.835 --> 17:53.197
Don't mind me.

17:58.546 --> 18:00.510
About that cell death.

18:01.599 --> 18:03.669
Yeah, we're just
collating statements.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.508
Make it clear to your officers,
will you.

18:05.566 --> 18:08.698
I expect honesty and
transparency in all testimonies.

18:08.756 --> 18:12.101
Anyone who's innocent has nothing
to fear about the events of last night.

18:15.739 --> 18:17.081
However,

18:18.598 --> 18:21.632
if there's so much as
a sniff of bad behaviour,

18:21.749 --> 18:24.511
I'll have your team disbanded
and discarded so fast

18:24.570 --> 18:26.573
you'll think your
arses were lightning.

18:26.787 --> 18:31.260
Delighted to know we have your
unconditional support, Frank. As ever.

18:31.406 --> 18:34.674
Plenty'd like to see you
head on a pole, Gene.

18:35.102 --> 18:37.144
I've sheltered you
one too many times.

18:37.222 --> 18:40.703
- I think I know where I stand.
- Right on the edge.

18:41.560 --> 18:42.843
Wobbling.

18:45.964 --> 18:47.757
Not gonna wash your hands, sir?

18:48.142 --> 18:49.893
Most unlike you.

18:55.016 --> 18:57.466
I don't understand.
It's all in my statement.

18:57.675 --> 18:59.377
I'm not sure it is, sweetheart.

18:59.437 --> 19:01.354
I mean, for instance,
Kemble was a flasher.

19:01.404 --> 19:02.943
You must've been
threatened by that.

19:02.993 --> 19:05.035
- He didn't flash me.
- Yeah, but if he had done.

19:05.086 --> 19:06.528
She just said he didn't.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.957
But you'd have felt threatened.

19:09.096 --> 19:10.241
Disgusted.

19:10.759 --> 19:12.133
As a bird, like.

19:12.183 --> 19:13.179
Maybe.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.682
Right. Well, let's put that in.

19:14.782 --> 19:16.175
What did he do when you looked in?

19:16.215 --> 19:17.310
Flicked me the Vs.

19:17.360 --> 19:23.146
"Brandished his arms in
an aggressive and violent manner"

19:23.217 --> 19:24.790
How many times
did you check on him?

19:24.910 --> 19:25.776
Once.

19:26.234 --> 19:27.399
Maybe twice.

19:27.578 --> 19:30.576
Your memory's hardly
your best quality, is it Chris?

19:31.283 --> 19:32.876
Let's round it up to four.

19:35.237 --> 19:37.816
I said, he slid the tray
along the floor at her.

19:37.897 --> 19:45.832
"Mr Kemble angrily threw food in
the face of WPC Annie Cartwright."

19:46.026 --> 19:47.465
Sign there.

20:05.319 --> 20:07.089
At Hyde,

20:07.594 --> 20:10.687
we had a name for
what you're doing now.

20:11.114 --> 20:12.437
Spin.

20:13.447 --> 20:15.898
I'm protecting my team.

20:16.073 --> 20:17.979
Yourself, you mean.

20:20.196 --> 20:25.953
Do you know how long I've spent
building up this department?

20:26.205 --> 20:28.053
I am my team.

20:28.948 --> 20:31.962
One falls, we all do.

20:32.973 --> 20:35.833
Right, Oswald.
How did he die?

20:35.989 --> 20:37.797
Coronary failure.

20:37.933 --> 20:39.878
Massive heart attack to you.

20:39.956 --> 20:43.340
He had a perennially weak heart,
high blood pressure,

20:43.398 --> 20:45.110
the whole kit and caboodle.

20:45.185 --> 20:46.708
The fight didn't kill him.

20:46.768 --> 20:50.113
No. Those injuries
were entirely superficial.

20:50.193 --> 20:51.697
Cuts and bruises.

20:51.827 --> 20:54.569
But his heart failed
because he ingested

20:54.639 --> 20:57.227
such a large amount of cocaine.

20:57.267 --> 20:58.402
Cocaine.

20:58.521 --> 21:01.823
He was high when we brought him in,
which means we're in the clear.

21:01.850 --> 21:04.559
Oswald, my beauty, you've
just done us a massive favour.

21:04.739 --> 21:07.139
I shall sleep soundly for years.

21:07.219 --> 21:09.947
He didn't show any signs
of drug use during the interview.

21:10.037 --> 21:12.756
If he'd taken cocaine he would
have been hyperactive, restless.

21:12.786 --> 21:15.893
Just because he wasn't playing the
sitar or seeing purple elephants...

21:15.933 --> 21:17.296
We're missing something here.

21:17.465 --> 21:20.632
There's something I've read about
cocaine when I was in... Hyde.

21:20.851 --> 21:22.654
I can't remember what it is.

21:22.733 --> 21:24.236
Sorry it doesn't match the pictures

21:24.276 --> 21:26.118
in your I-Spy book
of druggie behaviour,

21:26.148 --> 21:28.389
but the post mortem was conclusive.

21:28.456 --> 21:31.286
The important is we make sure
the sister doesn't kick up a fuss.

21:31.386 --> 21:33.536
I want this case glued shut.

21:34.903 --> 21:35.998
Bloody council.

21:36.038 --> 21:39.872
Spends my taxes housing the scum
of this city in penthouses.

21:39.911 --> 21:42.132
All mod cons, city views.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.894
Jammy bastards.

21:44.024 --> 21:45.727
What's she like, tasty?

21:45.817 --> 21:48.654
- Be gentle, will you?
- I'm not a bleeding luddite.

21:50.446 --> 21:52.825
Hiya love. DCI Hunt.
How're you feeling?

21:52.855 --> 21:55.474
Just come to talk to you about
how your brother copped it.

22:00.129 --> 22:03.523
The post-mortem concluded that
Billy died from a heart attack.

22:04.085 --> 22:05.629
Because of that fight he had.

22:05.659 --> 22:06.854
'Fraid not, darling.

22:06.924 --> 22:09.444
Seems a large quantity of cocaine
skipped up his nose,

22:09.464 --> 22:11.017
conked out his heart.
- Drugs?

22:11.076 --> 22:12.689
Lot of dangerous hobbies,
your Billy.

22:12.729 --> 22:14.492
Did you know that
Billy took cocaine?

22:14.560 --> 22:16.711
He doesn't. He'd never take drugs.

22:16.781 --> 22:20.764
With respect, you probably thought
he kept his cock in his keks and all.

22:20.987 --> 22:22.291
He your boss?

22:22.371 --> 22:24.512
Well, what would I get
for smacking him one?

22:24.861 --> 22:27.628
Round of applause
from half our station.

22:27.775 --> 22:31.493
Right. Well, we know he was supplying
cocaine to students at the Tech.

22:31.622 --> 22:34.097
Obviously liked a
little sniff himself.

22:34.403 --> 22:36.279
He's got a dicky heart.

22:36.514 --> 22:38.426
Doctor warned him to go easy.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.714
Why would he go
messing with drugs?

22:40.866 --> 22:42.344
He might be a bit...

22:42.615 --> 22:45.371
...simple.
but he's not stupid!

22:45.465 --> 22:47.272
You've never been
tempted to have a go

22:47.295 --> 22:49.406
at the old magic
talcum powder yourself?

22:52.359 --> 22:53.740
Women!

22:53.982 --> 22:56.129
Can't say two words to 'em.

22:56.445 --> 22:57.982
Oh well, at least that's done with.

22:58.064 --> 22:59.929
Let's get back
and do some proper work.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.534
She said Billy Kemble
didn't take drugs.

23:02.592 --> 23:05.572
And the post-mortem said he did.
Oh dear, who shall I believe?

23:05.630 --> 23:07.132
Guv, we have got to...

23:10.006 --> 23:11.366
D'you hear that?

23:12.575 --> 23:15.015
That's the sound of this case
being closed.

23:19.214 --> 23:22.335
The entire information and
research database for this station

23:22.405 --> 23:25.948
consists of a list of
pub opening hours...

23:26.487 --> 23:29.045
and a leaflet
on cycling proficiency.

23:29.443 --> 23:32.106
What is a database?

23:32.962 --> 23:35.777
What I wouldn't give
for a decent search engine now.

23:36.721 --> 23:39.431
Are you sure there's no
other information on drugs?

23:41.331 --> 23:44.416
There was a bit in last year's
chief constable's report about...

23:44.475 --> 23:47.114
pharmacies dishing
out pills illegally.

23:47.572 --> 23:49.191
No, I mean...

23:49.390 --> 23:52.428
information on how the body reacts.

23:52.780 --> 23:55.971
The effects cocaine has
on the metabolism, you know,

23:56.088 --> 23:57.942
How long it takes to...

24:01.613 --> 24:02.481
What?

24:03.549 --> 24:06.469
Cocaine is most likely
to cause heart failure

24:06.516 --> 24:09.132
during the first hour
after it's ingested.

24:09.531 --> 24:13.366
Twenty four times more likely,
the last study I read.

24:13.507 --> 24:16.216
I'm clearly not as up to date
as I'd like to think.

24:16.298 --> 24:18.034
Oh, I'm well ahead with my reading.

24:18.163 --> 24:20.708
I'll agree your
man's coronary failure

24:20.778 --> 24:23.664
would have been a rapid
reaction to the cocaine.

24:23.781 --> 24:25.437
Kemble suffered
his heart attack...

24:25.506 --> 24:28.627
two hours after the
fight with Collins.

24:28.697 --> 24:31.489
That's five hours after
we first brought him in.

24:31.722 --> 24:32.461
So?

24:32.673 --> 24:35.066
So to cause the
attack at that time,

24:35.652 --> 24:38.514
he must have taken the cocaine
while he was still in his cell.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.403
Like hell.
He was searched.

24:40.464 --> 24:42.416
All his possessions
were confiscated.

24:42.476 --> 24:44.956
Billy Kemble did not have
drugs in that cell.

24:45.026 --> 24:47.276
Well, if it was nothing to do
with Albert Collins

24:47.366 --> 24:49.566
and he didn't have
drugs in the cell,

24:50.592 --> 24:52.424
how did Billy Kemble die?

25:02.552 --> 25:04.514
There are enough
unanswered questions

25:04.584 --> 25:07.083
for us to treat this
as a potential homicide.

25:07.282 --> 25:10.530
Andrea Kemble was adamant
her brother didn't touch the drugs.

25:10.646 --> 25:11.729
And you believe her?

25:11.803 --> 25:14.617
He could have had cocaine stashed
up his arse, for all we know.

25:14.703 --> 25:18.014
This was not a murder,
a daft druggie got overexcited.

25:18.150 --> 25:22.146
How could he overdose when all his
possessions had been confiscated?

25:22.258 --> 25:24.772
I don't bloody know, he just did!

25:25.270 --> 25:27.983
The Super's gonna ask the same
questions as me, you know.

25:28.381 --> 25:31.294
Somebody in this station knows
what happened to Billy Kemble.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.896
You'd better do something about it.

25:37.008 --> 25:39.535
Right! Listen up, you lot.

25:39.610 --> 25:42.772
Now, we need to find the person
who supplied Kemble with drugs.

25:42.859 --> 25:45.995
Go through the usual suspects,
talk to your snouts,

25:46.094 --> 25:47.737
I want a major collar.

25:47.825 --> 25:51.983
So that if anyone questions how
Bill Kemble died of an overdose,

25:52.073 --> 25:55.476
we can say "don't worry about that,
we've found his supplier"!

25:55.918 --> 25:59.590
Come on, lads, let's make it
a good day to bury bad news!

26:01.121 --> 26:03.859
Is that what we're saying then?
That he overdosed?

26:03.983 --> 26:05.912
Don't concern yourselves with that.

26:06.199 --> 26:08.899
Just bring me your scalp.
And that includes you!

26:09.869 --> 26:11.985
I'll start looking for a supplier.

26:12.160 --> 26:15.022
Once there's been a full
investigation into Kemble's death.

26:15.084 --> 26:16.677
Is this what you do?

26:17.212 --> 26:20.399
Bust through stations, ripping them
apart, destroying the camaraderie?

26:20.449 --> 26:23.399
There has to be
a transparent investigation.

26:23.473 --> 26:25.601
If we can't police ourselves,

26:25.689 --> 26:27.693
how are the public
supposed to trust us?

26:27.751 --> 26:31.660
The public don't give a damn what
we do, as long as we get results.

26:31.770 --> 26:32.596
You're wrong.

26:32.706 --> 26:35.892
They'd piss their pants if they knew
what we went through to get collars.

26:35.954 --> 26:38.432
So if you think I'm going to do
my dirty washing in public-

26:38.472 --> 26:42.008
If the circumstances surrounding
Kemble's death are not investigated...

26:42.077 --> 26:43.290
You'll what?

26:44.328 --> 26:46.100
That's me done here.

26:46.918 --> 26:48.341
Back to Hyde.

26:49.476 --> 26:50.701
I'll drive you.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.540
Tell me this.

26:53.876 --> 26:56.465
If everything is
so wonderful in Hyde,

26:56.577 --> 27:00.037
why are you hanging around my department
like the smell of last night's haddock?

27:00.123 --> 27:03.161
You could have gone back any time
you fancied. The truth is...

27:03.235 --> 27:06.720
you like it here,
you just can't bear to admit it.

27:07.405 --> 27:08.438
All right.

27:08.712 --> 27:11.376
You want a full investigation
into Billy Kemble's death, fine.

27:11.413 --> 27:12.845
You take the damn case.

27:12.895 --> 27:16.679
Fill your boots, but I'm telling
you this. You'll find nothing.

27:46.100 --> 27:47.880
That's tabasco!

28:09.232 --> 28:11.709
<i>There's no discernible reaction.</i>

28:13.884 --> 28:15.042
Who's there?

28:18.953 --> 28:19.887
<i>Sam.</i>

28:23.198 --> 28:24.256
Who's there?

28:24.402 --> 28:26.916
<i>We need some response
to these tests.</i>

28:26.991 --> 28:28.534
What tests?

28:29.194 --> 28:31.360
I'm here. I can hear you.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.439
<i>Sam has to help us.</i>

28:34.136 --> 28:35.891
- <i>Sam.</i>
- What?!

28:37.386 --> 28:39.888
Get me out of here!

29:16.615 --> 29:19.328
What did Chris give you, Annie?
In the corridor.

29:19.390 --> 29:20.199
What?

29:20.921 --> 29:21.917
Nothing.

29:23.249 --> 29:25.925
Bar of chocolate.
I bought him one the other day.

29:28.614 --> 29:31.738
You searched Kemble. You
took his possessions off him, yeah?

29:32.597 --> 29:34.588
Are you formally questioning me?

29:34.688 --> 29:35.933
Why, do I need to?

29:37.202 --> 29:39.045
Could you have missed anything?

29:39.717 --> 29:41.821
What's all this for?
What are you trying to prove?

29:41.870 --> 29:43.676
I'm just trying
to find out the truth.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.580
Why is that so problematic?

29:47.734 --> 29:50.883
Do you know how many times I've
defended you to people in this station?

29:50.933 --> 29:54.318
And now you take it on yourself
to investigate us?

29:55.451 --> 29:57.020
Why are you doubting me?

29:57.281 --> 29:59.434
Do you think we're not
bothered about what went on?

29:59.534 --> 30:01.252
Think you're the
only one that cares?

30:01.314 --> 30:03.617
I'm asking for the facts.

30:03.804 --> 30:05.683
You know, somebody around here...

30:05.857 --> 30:08.098
knows more than they're letting on.

30:08.894 --> 30:11.944
Friendship and trust
go both ways, Sam.

30:12.579 --> 30:14.546
At least, they're supposed to.

30:19.848 --> 30:22.213
"Get me out of here!"

30:28.599 --> 30:32.084
What happened to the cocaine wraps that
were confiscated from Billy Kemble?

30:32.732 --> 30:34.611
Did you hear someone fart?

30:38.060 --> 30:40.772
Who was the last person
to see him alive?

30:41.084 --> 30:44.332
There it is again. Egg sarnies.

30:45.764 --> 30:47.656
Now, I've asked you nicely.

30:50.956 --> 30:54.519
Go shove your head
up your arse.

30:56.496 --> 30:59.187
How's this helping, sir?

31:01.636 --> 31:03.659
I will get to the truth, you know.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.548
With or without your help.

31:16.120 --> 31:20.352
For the tenth time, Phyllis,
I need that charge sheet.

31:20.430 --> 31:22.126
Look, I have a station
to keep running.

31:22.157 --> 31:24.242
I'll fetch it up when I can
lay me hands on it.

31:24.304 --> 31:25.424
C'mon!

31:28.054 --> 31:30.636
It can't be that difficult to find!

31:37.031 --> 31:39.256
It must be in here somewhere.

31:39.708 --> 31:42.446
Oi, you've no need
to go snooping.

31:42.897 --> 31:46.476
There.
Was that so difficult?

31:47.441 --> 31:49.277
Apparently not,

31:50.008 --> 31:53.602
seeing as there's two of them,
for the same night.

31:53.992 --> 31:56.590
It weren't even my ruddy shift.

31:57.664 --> 32:01.663
I had a kip, hour and a half.
Two hours max.

32:02.395 --> 32:05.444
And while you were asleep,
Billy Kemble died!

32:05.507 --> 32:07.249
I didn't know
that were gonna happen.

32:07.358 --> 32:09.817
I moved him out of
Collins's cell after that fight.

32:09.910 --> 32:12.259
Annie woke me
when she found him.

32:13.333 --> 32:16.180
Look, if I could go back...

32:16.538 --> 32:19.027
I've never had a cell death!

32:20.008 --> 32:23.649
Alright, it's not exactly Raffles
here, but we treat them fair.

32:23.868 --> 32:25.677
And then that bugger!

32:25.755 --> 32:27.663
You didn't mention sleeping
in your statement.

32:27.710 --> 32:29.366
Like that's the first
thing I'd put in.

32:29.403 --> 32:31.908
Asleep on the job, with a lad up
choking on his chips.

32:32.238 --> 32:35.038
I mean, maybe if this station
weren't run like Fred Karno's army,

32:35.085 --> 32:36.548
I wouldn't have had to cover.

32:36.626 --> 32:39.131
But no, it's always the women
what cop the flak.

32:39.706 --> 32:42.180
Why did you have to
rewrite the charge sheet?

32:42.274 --> 32:44.437
Look, no good'll come of this.

32:44.826 --> 32:46.615
Why rewrite it?

32:48.529 --> 32:50.069
To protect Annie.

32:50.131 --> 32:51.703
<i>12.10 am.</i>

32:51.858 --> 32:53.584
You noted
on the charge sheet...

32:53.679 --> 32:56.821
that Billy Kemble complained
he was feeling ill.

32:56.932 --> 32:58.702
What was the matter with him?

32:58.819 --> 33:00.764
Please don't make me do this.

33:00.861 --> 33:02.728
Why didn't you call a doctor?

33:02.884 --> 33:04.459
I can't...

33:05.354 --> 33:08.719
Annie! I can't help you
if you don't answer me.

33:09.886 --> 33:11.053
Stand up.

33:11.909 --> 33:14.457
- Why?
- Stand up!

33:19.124 --> 33:21.088
You're upsetting my officers.

33:21.186 --> 33:23.209
There are questions
I need them to answer.

33:23.286 --> 33:28.246
They're following a serious line of
enquiry to find Billy Kemble's supplier.

33:28.479 --> 33:30.657
You're stopping them
from carying out that work.

33:30.716 --> 33:34.158
Questions such as why do their
statements and the charge sheet

33:34.235 --> 33:35.344
not tally.

33:35.441 --> 33:40.498
Why did they fail to notify us that
Phyllis had fallen asleep on duty.

33:40.830 --> 33:44.039
Why did WPC Cartwright
not call a doctor

33:44.097 --> 33:46.625
when Billy Kemble complained
he was feeling ill.

33:46.703 --> 33:48.686
And why did DC Skelton here

33:48.803 --> 33:51.818
not mention in his statement
that he'd been in to see Kemble

33:51.895 --> 33:54.482
fifty minutes before
he was found dead.

33:55.609 --> 33:59.246
Useful things, charge sheets,
if you bother to look at them.

33:59.615 --> 34:01.307
You're working too hard.

34:01.385 --> 34:04.166
You're seeing conspiracies
that don't exist.

34:05.430 --> 34:09.826
Or... maybe just getting
too close for comfort.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.123
I'm taking you off duty.

34:14.241 --> 34:17.527
Go home.
Go back to Hyde, I don't care.

34:17.742 --> 34:21.301
But you don't come
anywhere near my station.

34:22.507 --> 34:25.599
Now get out. Now!

34:39.199 --> 34:43.110
Drowing your sorrows
so early in the day, mon brave?

34:43.498 --> 34:47.097
Don't worry, Nelson. I'll be out
before the others descend.

34:47.973 --> 34:50.092
I don't want
to cost you your trade.

34:50.228 --> 34:53.049
Hey, I set the rules here.

34:53.224 --> 34:55.538
You? Always welcome.

34:56.803 --> 34:59.759
- You're a good man.
- I hope not.

35:03.664 --> 35:05.978
What am I doing, Nelson?

35:06.639 --> 35:08.409
Why am I still fighting?

35:08.545 --> 35:12.552
Oh boy. You got it bad today.

35:12.902 --> 35:15.469
Nobody else is bothered
about the truth.

35:15.586 --> 35:17.006
Why should I be?

35:19.564 --> 35:21.995
You always got
to follow the truth.

35:22.165 --> 35:26.249
Even if it brings the whole damn
thing crashing down around you.

35:31.659 --> 35:34.285
That's how
they want me to respond.

35:34.407 --> 35:37.445
Maybe the tests are working.

35:38.685 --> 35:41.213
Maybe I'm close to getting home.

35:41.310 --> 35:43.012
You lost me.

35:43.814 --> 35:49.577
Hunt says this investigation
could demolish everything.

35:50.962 --> 35:52.932
That's what I have to do.

35:53.661 --> 35:57.673
Destroy his world...
then I can get back to mine.

35:57.770 --> 36:00.590
I wasn't talking destruction.

36:00.736 --> 36:03.556
I was talking truth.

36:03.872 --> 36:06.813
What if they're the same thing?

36:19.017 --> 36:20.792
Leave us alone!

36:23.198 --> 36:25.483
Get off me,
I'm a copper, not a villain!

36:25.580 --> 36:27.233
Are you gonna talk to me now?

36:27.428 --> 36:29.932
You half twisted my arm.

36:31.245 --> 36:32.582
Girl.

36:36.204 --> 36:42.063
The charge sheet says you visited
Billy Kemble just after midnight.

36:44.316 --> 36:47.778
Now, that makes you the
last person to see him alive.

36:47.953 --> 36:50.714
Guv'll have me guts for
garters if I talk to you.

36:50.948 --> 36:53.671
I just want the truth
about what happened.

36:53.963 --> 36:56.024
Don't have to talk to you.

36:56.336 --> 36:58.845
Fine. Let's talk about the weather.

36:58.981 --> 37:00.595
Or the football.

37:01.587 --> 37:04.758
Do you think Docherty's
really gonna sell Denis Law?

37:07.096 --> 37:09.255
How've you been sleeping,
by the way?

37:09.333 --> 37:11.482
Now that you've got
a death on your conscience.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.613
- Stop it.
- A man died.

37:14.652 --> 37:17.045
Yeah, and raking it up
is not gonna bring him back.

37:17.161 --> 37:19.398
Raking what up, Chris?

37:20.098 --> 37:21.654
What happened?

37:25.651 --> 37:28.627
He was just trying to get a result,
that's all.

37:28.724 --> 37:29.969
Please the guv.

37:30.046 --> 37:33.430
Ray said he'd thought of
a way to get a name out of Kemble.

37:35.317 --> 37:38.779
Phyllis was asleep.
Annie was getting a cuppa.

37:38.837 --> 37:41.443
That's why Ray wasn't
down on the charge sheet.

37:41.559 --> 37:44.457
I went to fetch the wotchamacallit,
which took me ten minutes,

37:44.535 --> 37:48.230
by which time, Annie was back and
my name goes on the charge sheet.

37:48.298 --> 37:50.534
Hang on, what did you have
to go and fetch?

37:50.572 --> 37:51.973
The tape recorder.

37:52.109 --> 37:54.190
It's what I do now,
since you showed us.

37:54.282 --> 37:56.470
So there's a tape
of what happened in that cell,

37:56.567 --> 37:59.557
and you haven't seen fit
to mention that?

38:00.238 --> 38:02.256
Forgot it was running.

38:02.694 --> 38:05.684
I hid it.
I needed more time to think.

38:06.632 --> 38:11.033
It weren't no one's fault, not
really. We just wanted a result.

38:13.043 --> 38:14.813
Where's the tape?

38:16.835 --> 38:18.372
Annie's locker.

39:25.375 --> 39:27.670
You're not supposed to be here.

39:29.809 --> 39:33.252
Well, if you'd told me what happened,
I wouldn't need to be, would I?

39:34.321 --> 39:36.655
But now I can find out for myself.

39:36.810 --> 39:38.639
Typical Chris.

39:38.755 --> 39:43.384
I told him to destroy it and
instead, he trusts it to a plonk.

39:49.239 --> 39:50.619
Get out my way.

39:50.717 --> 39:52.739
Banned from the station.

39:52.934 --> 39:55.696
Breaking into lockers.
Stealing possessions.

39:55.812 --> 39:58.010
How bad are you trying to look?

40:00.130 --> 40:01.530
Give it to me.

40:07.955 --> 40:09.997
I'll just hand it over to you,
shall I?

40:10.075 --> 40:13.109
Because I've every confidence
you'll do the right thing.

40:14.967 --> 40:17.923
Are you gonna give it to me
or am I gonna have to take it?

40:22.143 --> 40:25.916
You really believe we're gonna have
a punch-up over this tape?

41:14.982 --> 41:18.117
<i>Interview with Billy Kemble
commenced at 7.05 pm.</i>

41:18.216 --> 41:22.417
<i>Present are DS Ray Carling
and DC Chris Skelton.</i>

41:46.619 --> 41:50.120
<i>You said I could have
something to eat.</i>

41:50.178 --> 41:54.846
<i>When you tell us who gives you
them drugs. It's not difficult, is it?</i>

41:55.215 --> 41:58.308
<i>I don't know a name.</i>

41:59.708 --> 42:01.614
<i>What you doing with that?</i>

42:01.750 --> 42:03.500
<i>I thought you liked it.</i>

42:04.317 --> 42:05.679
<i>I just sell it.</i>

42:05.737 --> 42:08.752
<i>Did you know that this stuff's
supposed to make folks talk, Chris?</i>

42:08.791 --> 42:11.144
<i>Yeah, hang on, Ray,
you can't be using that.</i>

42:11.300 --> 42:14.548
<i>I promised the guv a result.
I'm not letting him down.</i>

42:14.703 --> 42:17.173
<i>- Give us a hand here.
- Oh no, no.</i>

42:17.232 --> 42:19.741
<i>- I don't want it.
- I'm not sure we should be...</i>

42:19.779 --> 42:21.627
<i>Don't you wanna be
a good copper?</i>

42:21.724 --> 42:23.999
<i>- Yeah, but you can't-
- So let's get him talking!</i>

42:24.038 --> 42:25.575
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

42:26.722 --> 42:28.025
<i>No, don't!</i>

42:33.296 --> 42:35.688
<i>Now let's see what you've got
to say for yourself.</i>

42:40.220 --> 42:42.204
<i>Don't do that, please!</i>

42:47.673 --> 42:50.940
Fifty minutes later,
Billy Kemble was dead.

42:51.193 --> 42:53.819
Cocaine makes people talk,
that's what I heard.

42:53.994 --> 42:55.745
Little bit like that
don't kill someone.

42:55.861 --> 42:59.304
- He had a weak heart.
- Well, I didn't know, did I?

43:00.976 --> 43:02.630
He's a drug dealer,

43:02.746 --> 43:05.722
I was doing what you asked.
Getting a name.

43:05.878 --> 43:07.103
Just...

43:07.783 --> 43:09.436
went skew-whiff.

43:09.553 --> 43:12.723
He complained of feeling ill.
Why didn't you call a doctor?

43:16.885 --> 43:19.472
DS Carling told me not to.

43:20.346 --> 43:22.700
He's my superior officer.

43:24.372 --> 43:27.718
I didn't feel abled to disobey.

43:27.932 --> 43:29.644
I only said
give it twenty minutes.

43:29.722 --> 43:31.472
By which time he was dead.

43:31.550 --> 43:33.825
How am I supposed
to know how drugs work?

43:33.942 --> 43:37.054
The call was my responsibility.
I should have been there.

43:37.141 --> 43:40.137
- I got it wrong.
- We all did.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.676
I was doing what you taught me.

43:43.793 --> 43:46.535
I was trying to
get a result for you!

43:49.875 --> 43:52.967
That concludes my investigation.

43:55.612 --> 43:57.304
I don't know...

44:00.647 --> 44:03.739
who the biggest
dickhead is round here.

44:04.050 --> 44:06.248
You for what happened,

44:07.084 --> 44:11.053
you for your holier-than-thou act,

44:11.500 --> 44:14.632
or me for having
any of you on my team.

44:17.608 --> 44:20.875
You're a bloody disgrace.

44:23.871 --> 44:25.874
Go home and get some sleep.

44:26.166 --> 44:29.471
Ray Carling has to be charged.
He caused a man's death!

44:29.530 --> 44:32.058
And he'll be haunted by
it for the rest of his life.

44:32.174 --> 44:35.052
What, and that justifies
Billy Kemble's corpse, does it?

44:35.150 --> 44:38.903
- The fact that Ray learned a lesson?!
- That's not what I said!

44:41.150 --> 44:44.942
Ray Carling catches more villains than
the rest of the department put together.

44:45.001 --> 44:49.105
I boot him out, dozens of villains
in this city go uncollared.

44:50.388 --> 44:53.228
Why not go the whole hog
and promote him!

44:53.870 --> 44:56.923
Because I'm to blame for this!

44:59.511 --> 45:01.825
I left a weak man in charge.

45:05.618 --> 45:07.057
You see,

45:08.088 --> 45:09.625
these lads,

45:10.131 --> 45:12.815
they think they're
made in my image.

45:13.534 --> 45:16.276
But they've never learnt
where draw the line

45:16.335 --> 45:18.863
and it scares the shit out of me.

45:21.236 --> 45:24.543
You did a good investigation.
I'm glad I let you.

45:26.157 --> 45:28.549
What do you mean,
"I'm glad I let you"?

45:35.687 --> 45:37.049
You set me up.

45:37.146 --> 45:39.888
Well, I'm hardly gonna
investigate my own team.

45:40.063 --> 45:42.086
It would have been
suicide for morale.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.256
You were the only one
I could trust.

45:46.326 --> 45:48.271
Or the only one who was expendable.

45:48.375 --> 45:50.765
Well, isn't that
how you've always fancied yourself?

45:51.363 --> 45:55.209
The moral compass
in a dodgy department?

46:01.360 --> 46:04.695
I don't understand. You could have
just buried the whole thing.

46:05.019 --> 46:07.073
We sort things out ourselves,
around here.

46:08.094 --> 46:12.226
I've seen where "sorting things
out for ourselves" leads.

46:13.122 --> 46:17.417
It leads to one in twenty British
prisoners being innocent.

46:18.003 --> 46:21.637
Which means we got the right
villain nineteen times. That"s...

46:21.903 --> 46:24.355
95% success.

46:25.400 --> 46:27.840
Better than most rubber johnnies.

46:30.641 --> 46:34.031
I don't make the rules.
I just live by 'em.

46:35.262 --> 46:36.146
So...

46:36.943 --> 46:38.250
What happens now?

46:39.544 --> 46:41.337
Power's in your hands.

46:41.611 --> 46:42.706
You've got the tape.

46:43.589 --> 46:45.319
You can still destroy us.

46:46.788 --> 46:48.606
If that's what you want.

47:20.037 --> 47:23.771
<i>And the answer to the problem is...
clearer than we might think.</i>

47:24.368 --> 47:28.550
<i>Responses to sensory tests
vary from patient to patient.</i>

47:29.159 --> 47:30.852
<i>This could be a turning point.</i>

47:32.060 --> 47:32.869
<i>Sam?</i>

47:36.900 --> 47:39.826
I can hear you!
Help me!

47:39.963 --> 47:41.731
Tell me what to do!

47:41.893 --> 47:44.221
What do I do?
Is it this?

47:47.280 --> 47:50.218
<i>This tells us that
the probable outcome is X,</i>

47:50.267 --> 47:52.495
<i>but only if Y is constant.</i>

47:53.691 --> 47:55.185
What does that mean?

47:55.596 --> 47:57.500
<i>Let's work it through
from the start.</i>

47:57.666 --> 48:00.817
What the hell does that mean?
What does that mean?

48:37.849 --> 48:39.171
What?

48:39.823 --> 48:41.204
It's Annie.

48:42.235 --> 48:44.432
Thought you might fancy a walk.

48:45.288 --> 48:48.303
This tape could be my best chance
of getting out of here.

48:48.361 --> 48:50.636
Sam, when is this gonna stop?

48:50.753 --> 48:52.795
We are people, we have lives,

48:52.853 --> 48:55.868
we're not some game created
just for your benefit.

48:56.043 --> 48:59.090
You think you give that tape to
the Super and we just melt away?

48:59.119 --> 49:00.155
I don't know.

49:00.663 --> 49:02.665
You said you were
here for a reason.

49:03.172 --> 49:04.726
You're doing my head in, Annie.

49:04.975 --> 49:08.211
If I could go back in time
and do things differently, I would.

49:08.271 --> 49:09.755
We all would.

49:09.895 --> 49:13.231
We have to live with what we did,
we don't need you to punish us.

49:13.291 --> 49:14.566
You've got...

49:15.273 --> 49:16.527
my career...

49:18.190 --> 49:19.455
my life...

49:20.141 --> 49:21.734
in your hands.

49:22.600 --> 49:24.671
You want me to destroy this tape?

49:25.159 --> 49:26.135
For you?

49:26.493 --> 49:28.554
What have I ever asked in return?

49:28.654 --> 49:30.297
Or do I mean that little to you?

49:30.497 --> 49:32.478
<i>Alpha One to 920.</i>

49:35.028 --> 49:36.840
920 to Alpha One.

49:37.010 --> 49:40.057
DCI Hunt requests that
we get our arses into CID pronto.

49:40.146 --> 49:43.044
And he said if DI Tyler's with you,
get him there and all.

49:47.289 --> 49:49.954
- What's going on?
- How the hell should I know?

49:55.769 --> 49:56.819
Up.

50:01.894 --> 50:03.625
Detective Sergeant Ray Carling,

50:03.683 --> 50:07.379
you are hereby stripped of your rank
and demoted to Detective Constable.

50:07.593 --> 50:09.654
From now on,
your main responsibilities will be

50:09.713 --> 50:11.638
maintenance of CID
stationary cupboard.

50:11.677 --> 50:16.442
You will account for every pen,
pencil and paperclip in this office.

50:16.636 --> 50:17.570
C'mon, guv.

50:17.608 --> 50:20.798
You will only participate in other
investigations at my discretion.

50:20.934 --> 50:24.065
Half your wages for the next twelve
months, including any overtime,

50:24.123 --> 50:27.526
will be deducted by me and given
directly to the Police Benevolent Fund.

50:27.585 --> 50:31.008
You are also barred from the
Railway Arms until I decide otherwise.

50:31.104 --> 50:34.177
You so much as
belch out of line,

50:34.372 --> 50:37.503
and I'll have your scrotum
on a barbed-wire plate.

50:40.439 --> 50:42.287
You wanna say anything?

50:45.917 --> 50:47.181
Pardon?

50:51.557 --> 50:53.055
I let you down.

50:53.931 --> 50:55.331
I got it wrong.

50:57.704 --> 50:59.104
I'm sorry, guv.

51:08.475 --> 51:10.731
This has been shaming.

51:12.345 --> 51:14.874
We never talk of this again.

51:23.643 --> 51:25.335
It had to be public.

51:26.950 --> 51:28.408
It's over.

51:40.109 --> 51:41.743
It's not over.

51:54.007 --> 51:56.808
<i>Yes, well, I understand
your position, of course,</i>

51:56.885 --> 51:59.471
<i>but that will depend
on the issues involved.</i>

51:59.666 --> 52:01.805
<i>I can't give you
a straight answer now...</i>

52:04.859 --> 52:06.668
I'll telephone you back.

52:11.083 --> 52:13.417
I don't much care
for popular music.

52:13.533 --> 52:15.692
You'll like that even less.

52:15.867 --> 52:20.398
It demonstrates the manslaughter
of a prisoner by one of your officers.

52:20.709 --> 52:21.993
William Kemble?

52:28.146 --> 52:30.596
And what do you expect me
to do with this?

52:32.329 --> 52:35.382
Listen to it. Act upon it.

52:35.654 --> 52:38.980
My understanding is
it's been dealt with internally.

52:39.330 --> 52:41.256
What, a demotion?

52:42.539 --> 52:43.920
On that tape...

52:51.148 --> 52:54.027
Anyone could have made that.

52:54.280 --> 52:58.500
No officer worth his salt
would fall for such a simple hoax.

52:59.024 --> 53:01.222
That tape was the truth.

53:10.022 --> 53:12.297
What were you expecting, Tyler?

53:15.779 --> 53:18.716
The whole world
to come crashing down?

53:27.615 --> 53:29.735
Me again. Sorry about that.

53:55.689 --> 53:58.140
He didn't do anything, did he?

54:01.330 --> 54:03.138
It's the way of the world.

54:06.620 --> 54:10.976
A world which creates
coppers like Ray.

54:13.173 --> 54:17.277
Awash with
institutionalised corruption.

54:18.891 --> 54:24.979
People like Rathbone need to be
surgically removed from the force.

54:25.621 --> 54:28.091
We can't change this world, Sam.

54:28.577 --> 54:31.086
Only learn how to survive in it.

54:31.709 --> 54:33.576
I don't give up that easily.

54:35.229 --> 54:36.337
Good.

55:00.580 --> 55:02.019
I had to do it.

55:02.272 --> 55:04.567
So I do mean that little to you.

55:05.442 --> 55:07.990
You're the only one
who understands.

55:09.059 --> 55:11.724
But you could have destroyed me.

55:11.938 --> 55:13.319
All of us.

55:19.367 --> 55:21.643
Why am I still here?

55:23.414 --> 55:26.584
Nothing I do makes any difference.

55:28.509 --> 55:30.746
Is that what you really think?

55:32.795 --> 55:36.860
Don't... abandon me, Annie.

55:37.754 --> 55:39.116
Please.

55:48.329 --> 55:50.177
How would I do that?

55:51.343 --> 55:53.463
We're stuck here together.

55:57.350 --> 55:59.412
Back to work then, is it?

56:01.726 --> 56:03.438
Do I have a choice?

56:04.947 --> 56:07.612
Park? Pictures?

56:08.059 --> 56:09.848
There's always a choice.

56:16.109 --> 56:17.918
Back to work then.

56:33.512 --> 56:37.577
