Ow!

14:36.230 --> 14:38.412
Ow!

14:38.412 --> 14:39.980
That was unpleasant.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.590
You know, they call
me the extractor.

14:43.590 --> 14:46.660
And I need some
information, dog.

14:46.660 --> 14:50.920
And being that you're
the head of the DEA

14:50.920 --> 14:52.378
with privileged
information, you're

14:52.378 --> 14:54.212
going to tell me exactly
what I need to know

14:54.212 --> 14:56.475
or you're gonna die a horrible
fucking death, fat man,

14:56.475 --> 14:56.975
I promise.

15:02.950 --> 15:05.140
(HISPANIC ACCENT)
Really sorry, man.

15:05.140 --> 15:07.510
You got the wrong guy, man.

15:07.510 --> 15:09.000
I am from [INAUDIBLE], Mexico.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.220
I'm a Mexican [? jumping ?]

[GAGS]

15:23.840 --> 15:25.110
Oh, shit.

15:28.020 --> 15:30.840
Motherfucker.

15:30.840 --> 15:35.840
Oh, wow, my memory
just came back.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.888
Yeah I am the head of the DEA.

15:39.888 --> 15:41.690
That's me.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.310
Yeah, they call you the--

15:44.310 --> 15:49.315
the Extractor, right AKA Spyder.

15:51.870 --> 15:54.020
How you know my name?

15:54.020 --> 15:56.160
I'm the head of the the DEA.

15:56.160 --> 16:00.150
I got privileged information
like your dumb ass just said.

16:00.150 --> 16:03.950
What exactly do
you know about me?

16:03.950 --> 16:06.872
You're the biggest dope
dealer South of Panama.

16:06.872 --> 16:08.290
You work for Pelon.

16:08.290 --> 16:11.570
Others would say that
it's the other way around.

16:11.570 --> 16:14.510
And your main client
this last year

16:14.510 --> 16:19.850
was a cartel
[? Mongrel ?] Dallas.

16:19.850 --> 16:27.616
But shipments have been
prevented and delayed.

16:27.616 --> 16:29.600
Is it making that
metal pipe you're

16:29.600 --> 16:32.300
holding all that much harder?

16:32.300 --> 16:34.219
That's just delightful,
like for me, you know?

16:34.219 --> 16:36.135

16:38.051 --> 16:42.970
Let's see if I can adjust
your perception in terms

16:42.970 --> 16:50.110
of who I really am and help
you see the real problem you

16:50.110 --> 16:54.140
face right now.

16:54.140 --> 16:57.620
Be right back.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.763
You promise?

16:59.763 --> 17:00.680
What are you gonna do?

17:05.030 --> 17:07.500
Oh, you brought your
mother's underwear?

17:07.500 --> 17:09.200
I used to fuck her.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.467
Yeah, she wore bloomers.

17:10.467 --> 17:12.050
She had one of them
Mexican asses that

17:12.050 --> 17:14.680
bounced off the curb, you know?

17:14.680 --> 17:17.985

17:24.496 --> 17:25.536
Let me see.

17:25.536 --> 17:26.524
Oh, it's there.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.143
Yeah, come on, ready?

17:55.143 --> 17:56.060
What's with the jokes?

17:56.060 --> 17:56.750
I wanna hear a joke.

17:56.750 --> 17:57.040
Tell me.

17:57.040 --> 17:57.623
What happened?

17:57.623 --> 17:58.850
You're not funny anymore.

17:58.850 --> 17:59.860
You're not funny now!

17:59.860 --> 18:01.540
What happened!

18:01.540 --> 18:04.110
You motherfucker, I'm gonna
kill you, you son of a bitch!

18:22.130 --> 18:24.970
You intercepted my
shit from Pelon.

18:24.970 --> 18:31.002
Big problem for me, which
means big problem for you.

18:31.002 --> 18:37.476
Now listen, you
can have the drugs.

18:37.476 --> 18:40.464
You have my personal
fucking guarantee

18:40.464 --> 18:42.970
I will red carpet 'em.

18:42.970 --> 18:46.562
I don't give a fuck
about the drugs.

18:46.562 --> 18:50.999
Where are the girls?

18:50.999 --> 18:51.985
That's our focus.

18:56.915 --> 18:58.270
You know what the real focus is?

19:00.940 --> 19:03.720
Stryker's plan.

19:03.720 --> 19:07.820
I want [INAUDIBLE].

19:07.820 --> 19:10.656
I want to know where he lives.

19:10.656 --> 19:14.208
I want to know
who his family is.

19:14.208 --> 19:20.065
You tell me where he is, OK?

19:36.940 --> 19:41.320
Hey, Bruce, what
took you so long?

19:41.320 --> 19:42.970
Took you long-- You
see that, Spyder?

19:42.970 --> 19:47.032
When I say something's gonna
jump, I deliver the product.

19:47.032 --> 19:50.530
Now slowly hand over the pipe.

19:58.608 --> 19:59.650
What are you waiting for?

19:59.650 --> 20:01.910
Shoot me.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.430
When you hesitate, your
conviction is weak.

There's no mercy in
the world for weakness.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.680
give me my own personal

21:11.910 --> 21:13.320
My name is Craig Ford.

shit ass agency that I adore,

21:16.530 --> 21:17.880
the DEA.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.670
So this is how this shit
goes down, you know,

21:20.670 --> 21:22.860
with the cartels.

21:22.860 --> 21:24.570
The average
transportation of cocaine

21:24.570 --> 21:26.790
has always been
problematic for the US.

21:26.790 --> 21:30.180
However, they began to
take more serious notice

21:30.180 --> 21:32.970
when these cartel pricks
got into the sex trafficking

21:32.970 --> 21:33.570
business.

21:33.570 --> 21:38.130
And selling them back into the
US for ransom to their parents.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.010
The part that really
fucks with my head,

21:41.010 --> 21:43.698
you can only imagine in your
holy hellish nightmare, that's

21:43.698 --> 21:47.820
what these girls go through
if they don't make it back

21:47.820 --> 21:52.050
and they get washed ashore
like this little girl did.

21:52.050 --> 21:55.923
Anyway, that's how
we all got into it.

21:55.923 --> 22:01.070
That's how we all got into the
mix, Bruce Stryker, the DEA,

22:01.070 --> 22:03.845
my dumb ass, and
the head of the CIA.

22:06.370 --> 22:10.925
But trust and believe this,
it's one hell of a story.

22:14.200 --> 22:14.750
Huh?

22:14.750 --> 22:17.630
Oh.

22:17.630 --> 22:19.130
Hey, where are my
two DEA agents?

22:19.130 --> 22:20.100
They should be
standing at the door.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.740
Mr. Ford, you've been
rushed into intensive care.

22:21.740 --> 22:22.907
But I need my men back here.

22:22.907 --> 22:24.818
Until I ID you,
I'm gonna have to--

22:24.818 --> 22:26.360
take your goddamn
hands off me or I'm

22:26.360 --> 22:27.630
gonna take that
syringe he's holding

22:27.630 --> 22:29.510
and stick it up your
goddamn ass, all right?

22:29.510 --> 22:29.750
Mr. Ford?

22:29.750 --> 22:30.250
What?

22:30.250 --> 22:31.610
If you could take these pills--

22:31.610 --> 22:33.140
Listen, you'd be a better
nurse if you took off

22:33.140 --> 22:34.040
your fucking clothes.

Those three nurses,
they checked out.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.706

23:03.706 --> 23:05.450
You OK?

23:05.450 --> 23:06.540
Excellent.

Good to see you, Bruce.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.800

too fucking careful.

No, you can't.

1:26:07.820 --> 1:26:11.165
[EXERTION SOUNDS]

1:26:35.117 --> 1:26:36.115
[GUNSHOT]

1:26:38.111 --> 1:26:43.101
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

1:26:48.090 --> 1:26:48.590
No!

1:26:52.083 --> 1:26:53.580
No!

1:26:53.580 --> 1:26:55.077
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

1:27:01.564 --> 1:27:04.059
[SOBBING]

1:27:04.059 --> 1:27:08.051
[SCREAMING]

1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:28.050
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

1:29:22.761 --> 1:29:23.759
[GUNSHOT]

1:30:04.190 --> 1:30:05.782
It's that simple.

1:30:05.782 --> 1:30:08.802
Like I said, wolves
will turn on wolves.

1:30:08.802 --> 1:30:11.010
Then Bruce just steps in
and takes out the new alpha.

1:30:13.530 --> 1:30:15.890
I would have loved,
I would have loved

1:30:15.890 --> 1:30:17.660
to seen Spyder's expression.

1:30:17.660 --> 1:30:20.450
Spyder had just 30 seconds
to be the new alpha

1:30:20.450 --> 1:30:22.010
in their [? shit-driven ?]
operation.

1:30:22.010 --> 1:30:23.120
That's it.

1:30:23.120 --> 1:30:24.410
Then he's taken out.

1:30:24.410 --> 1:30:26.750
Just a flash of a
moment for Spyder,

1:30:26.750 --> 1:30:29.622
just enough to pick up
a cigar and not even

1:30:29.622 --> 1:30:31.330
get a chance to light
the son of a bitch.

1:30:31.330 --> 1:30:36.020
[LAUGHS] Yeah, that's it.

1:30:36.020 --> 1:30:42.420
In the end, a man will become
a criminal to save his family.

1:30:42.420 --> 1:30:45.230
I mean, he will do
just about anything.

1:30:45.230 --> 1:30:48.600
Bruce is the new alpha,
and rightfully so.

1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:51.900
And until every girl is
returned and more importantly

1:30:51.900 --> 1:30:56.700
this cartel is brought to its
knees in absolute submission

1:30:56.700 --> 1:31:00.940
so that Bruce's family will be
safe, it will be up to Bruce

1:31:00.940 --> 1:31:05.450
to run this cartel
like it was his own.

1:31:05.450 --> 1:31:09.690
You could say Stryker would
become more than a mole

1:31:09.690 --> 1:31:13.020
for the CIA and DEA.

1:31:13.020 --> 1:31:16.410
He is the new alpha
criminal of this cartel.

1:31:16.410 --> 1:31:19.620
And that, ladies
and gentlemen, that

1:31:19.620 --> 1:31:25.140
is just what the boys back home
in Washington had hoped for.

1:31:25.140 --> 1:31:26.220
God bless America.

1:31:43.920 --> 1:31:48.770
