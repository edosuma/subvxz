16:28.947 --> 16:31.198
- Oh, hi, Tommy.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.198
- Oh, hi, Stephanie.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.284
Oh, that's right. I'm

16:31.240 --> 16:33.284
the invisible uncle. I forgot.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.244
Listen, I'm-I'm gonna

16:33.326 --> 16:35.244
go get something to drink.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.537
What do you want, Tommy?

16:36.579 --> 16:39.081
(both)

16:36.579 --> 16:39.081
Ice tea, lemon, no sugar.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.750
Well, say the magic word, Tommy

16:39.123 --> 16:40.750
and bada-bing!

16:40.792 --> 16:42.961
I'm back in the room.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.921
I got the party pictures back.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.841
Here's a nice one of us,

16:44.963 --> 16:47.841
suitable for framing.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.134
So, don't you have

16:47.882 --> 16:50.134
something to do?

16:50.176 --> 16:54.472
Don't you worry your pretty,

16:50.176 --> 16:54.472
little, pointed head about me.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.933
Steph, I really don't think

16:54.514 --> 16:56.933
Tommy wants to look at pictures

16:56.975 --> 16:58.893
of a ten year old's

16:56.975 --> 16:58.893
birthday party.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.479
- No, it's okay.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.479
- No, D.J.'s right.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.148
You'd probably rather look

17:01.521 --> 17:04.148
at pictures of her.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.818
- Hmm?

17:04.190 --> 17:06.818
- What pictures?

17:06.860 --> 17:09.612
Here's one of D.J.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.612
when she had the mumps.

17:09.654 --> 17:12.907
Doesn't she remind you

17:09.654 --> 17:12.907
of Mr. Potato Head?

17:12.949 --> 17:15.702
- Give me that.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.702
- Here's my favorite.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.078
- D.J.'s first bath.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.078
- Oh!

17:19.956 --> 17:21.624
- You're dead.

17:19.956 --> 17:21.624
- And look.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.584
In this one, you can see

17:21.666 --> 17:23.584
the little rash on her fanny.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.461
Yeah! Check it out.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.840
That's it. Excuse us.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.258
But I would like to have

17:28.882 --> 17:31.258
a little chat with my sister.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.678
No, that's okay. I don't

17:31.300 --> 17:33.678
really feel like chatting.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.889
I do. Now.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.724
Don't worry, Tommy,

17:35.930 --> 17:37.724
I'll be right back.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.517
No, she won't. I promise.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.439
Stephanie, how could you

17:43.730 --> 17:45.439
do this to me?

17:45.481 --> 17:47.567
What about what you did to me,

17:45.481 --> 17:47.567
you backstabbing

17:47.608 --> 17:49.276
boyfriend-stealing traitor?

17:49.318 --> 17:52.780
What? You thought Tommy was

17:49.318 --> 17:52.780
your boyfriend? You're dreaming.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.241
- He was too my boyfriend.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.241
- Alright, girls.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.076
And he's gonna dump you

17:55.282 --> 17:57.076
and come back to me

17:57.117 --> 17:59.913
after he finds out

17:57.117 --> 17:59.913
you drool in your sleep.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.873
- I do not.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.873
- Yes, you do.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.750
And I have the picture

18:01.915 --> 18:03.750
to prove it.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.501
- Uh, girls.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.501
- Where did you get that?

18:05.543 --> 18:08.880
You didn't know I took this, did

18:05.543 --> 18:08.880
you? I knew it'd come in handy.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.298
- Alright.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.298
- Give me that, you little worm.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.384
Girls! Girls!

18:13.426 --> 18:14.886
- What's this all about?

18:13.426 --> 18:14.886
- I don't know.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.304
- But there they go.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.304
- Girls.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.308
- Girls.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.308
- 'D.J.'

18:21.350 --> 18:22.894
- 'Come on.'

18:21.350 --> 18:22.894
- Hey, hey, Jesse.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.395
What is going on here?

18:24.437 --> 18:28.274
Next time you bring a star home,

18:24.437 --> 18:28.274
try Angela Lansbury.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.234
Stephanie thinks

18:28.315 --> 18:30.234
Tommy is her boyfriend

18:30.276 --> 18:32.528
and she's showing him

18:30.276 --> 18:32.528
embarrassing pictures of me.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.155
He was too my boyfriend

18:32.570 --> 18:35.155
till you stole him.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.658
- You're insane.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.658
- I am not insane.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.453
He signed my CD

18:37.700 --> 18:40.453
"Love, Tommy."

18:40.494 --> 18:42.329
He signed my CD

18:40.494 --> 18:42.329
"Love, Tommy."

18:43.915 --> 18:46.500
But he wrote a special song

18:43.915 --> 18:46.500
just for me.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.211
And he kissed me.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.211
I love him and he loves me.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.173
Look, Steph, um..

18:53.215 --> 18:55.093
I know you feel

18:53.215 --> 18:55.093
very strongly about this

18:55.134 --> 18:58.054
and I don't mean

18:55.134 --> 18:58.054
to hurt your feelings but..

18:58.096 --> 18:59.889
...I don't think

18:58.096 --> 18:59.889
this is really love.

18:59.931 --> 19:02.391
I-I think it's just a crush,

18:59.931 --> 19:02.391
you know.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.143
Yeah, Steph. Your dad's right.

19:04.184 --> 19:07.021
You know, when it's really love,

19:04.184 --> 19:07.021
your-your heart starts pounding

19:07.063 --> 19:11.275
and-and-and your toes curl,

19:07.063 --> 19:11.275
and you start sweating, and..

19:13.486 --> 19:15.655
Well, this isn't it.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.740
Hey, Steph.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.159
Look, we all know what

19:17.782 --> 19:20.159
you're going through, okay?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.495
And sometimes, you wish

19:20.200 --> 19:22.495
for something so badly

19:22.536 --> 19:25.581
that, you, uh,

19:22.536 --> 19:25.581
start believing it's true.

19:25.623 --> 19:29.293
Yeah, Steph, face reality.

19:25.623 --> 19:29.293
Tommy was just being nice.

19:29.335 --> 19:33.506
He's not in love with you.

19:29.335 --> 19:33.506
He's in love with me.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.549
What?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.635
When did this happen?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.635
You just met him.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.179
Well, I know we only spent

19:37.677 --> 19:40.179
a couple of hours together

19:40.220 --> 19:42.556
and it's true we haven't

19:40.220 --> 19:42.556
talked about commitment yet

19:42.598 --> 19:45.059
but I think

19:42.598 --> 19:45.059
it's getting pretty serious.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.603
You know that nice, little talk

19:45.101 --> 19:47.603
we just had with Stephanie?

19:47.645 --> 19:48.938
Well, right about now,

19:47.645 --> 19:48.938
I think

19:48.980 --> 19:50.397
we're gonna have that talk

19:48.980 --> 19:50.397
with you.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.441
Dad, Stephanie is a child.

19:52.483 --> 19:55.153
I am a woman.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.613
Is it safe for me

19:55.194 --> 19:57.613
to come up yet?

19:57.655 --> 19:59.573
Tommy, would you please

19:57.655 --> 19:59.573
straighten everybody out

19:59.615 --> 20:02.493
about what's going on

19:59.615 --> 20:02.493
between us?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.745
Well, D.J. and I

20:02.535 --> 20:04.745
had a really fun day

20:04.787 --> 20:07.748
and I hope

20:04.787 --> 20:07.748
that we could be good friends.

20:07.790 --> 20:11.377
Friends?

20:07.790 --> 20:11.377
You mean, just friends?

20:11.418 --> 20:14.755
Yeah. I'm sorry

20:11.418 --> 20:14.755
if you misunderstood.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.966
Well, now,

20:14.797 --> 20:16.966
that she's out of the way

20:17.008 --> 20:19.301
I guess it's just

20:17.008 --> 20:19.301
you and me, Thomas.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.262
Stephanie, I wanna be friends

20:19.343 --> 20:22.262
with you too.

20:22.304 --> 20:26.059
You mean, friends like

20:22.304 --> 20:26.059
you're just friends with D.J.?

20:26.100 --> 20:27.518
Uh-huh.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.687
But you wrote "Love, Tommy"

20:27.560 --> 20:29.687
on my CD.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.438
I always write "Love, Tommy."

20:31.480 --> 20:34.692
Sometimes I'll even forget,

20:31.480 --> 20:34.692
and I'll write it for a guy.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.777
Yeah, you-you gotta watch that.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.531
Look, I didn't mean

20:38.654 --> 20:40.531
to cause any trouble.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.450
I hope you'll still come

20:40.573 --> 20:43.450
to my concert tonight, okay?

20:43.492 --> 20:44.911
I gotta go.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.911
It's nice meeting you all.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.913
- Yeah, nice meeting you, Tommy.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.913
- Tommy, thanks for this.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.916
- Thanks a lot.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.916
- Thanks a lot, Tommy.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.334
- Tommy, are you leaving?

20:49.957 --> 20:52.334
- Yeah.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.670
But it was really great

20:52.376 --> 20:54.670
meeting you, Michelle.

20:56.338 --> 20:59.717
Well, you are such a babe.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.219
Thanks. Goodbye.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.599
I'm gonna marry him.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.559
Oh, man. It never ends.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.945
Can I help you?

21:18.986 --> 21:22.240
Well, I thought if I'm miserable

21:18.986 --> 21:22.240
and you're miserable

21:22.281 --> 21:24.909
we might as well

21:22.281 --> 21:24.909
be miserable together.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.786
Sit. Be miserable.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.040
I was so dumb.

21:31.082 --> 21:33.333
I was so sure he liked me.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.879
At least you didn't make up

21:33.375 --> 21:36.879
wedding invitations.

21:36.921 --> 21:39.257
But you know what

21:36.921 --> 21:39.257
the weirdest part is?

21:39.298 --> 21:42.593
Everything dad, Joey,

21:39.298 --> 21:42.593
and Uncle Jesse said was right.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.471
I hate when that happens.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.057
If this was just a crush,

21:45.512 --> 21:48.057
I don't know if I can take it

21:48.099 --> 21:49.809
when I really fall in love.

21:49.850 --> 21:53.562
- What's that gonna feel like?

21:49.850 --> 21:53.562
- I don't know.

21:53.604 --> 21:56.065
I don't think I've ever

21:53.604 --> 21:56.065
really been in love before.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.858
But I hear it's pretty intense.

21:57.900 --> 22:01.070
I hear the same thing.

22:01.112 --> 22:03.489
You know what I just realized?

22:03.530 --> 22:07.534
I am sitting here talking

22:03.530 --> 22:07.534
to you about love and boys.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.245
Steph, you're really growing up.

22:09.287 --> 22:12.039
I must be, 'cause ever since

22:09.287 --> 22:12.039
I turned ten

22:12.081 --> 22:14.041
life got so complicated.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.838
Well, one day, we're gonna

22:16.294 --> 22:18.838
be dating like crazy.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.257
And I want you to know

22:18.879 --> 22:21.257
that I will never ever

22:21.299 --> 22:23.467
steal one of your boyfriends.

22:23.509 --> 22:26.220
Because guys are gonna come,

22:23.509 --> 22:26.220
and guys are gonna go

22:26.262 --> 22:29.389
but you and I

22:26.262 --> 22:29.389
will be sisters forever.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.184
Sisters forever.

22:35.395 --> 22:37.982
And I want every one of those

22:35.395 --> 22:37.982
embarrassing pictures back.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.025
You got it.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.653
- And the negatives.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.653
- We'll talk.
